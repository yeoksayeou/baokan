<p>社論</p>
<h3>日本政局的動向</h3>
<p>日本特別議會，巳於本月十一日召開：這次特別議會面臨蘆田內閣總辭，它的主要任務，就是選舉新首相，其次為修正「全國公務員法」。依日憲第六十七條規定，內閣總理大臣由國會議員中依國會之議决指定之。在慣例上，內閣總理人選，須會外先行協商，由多數黨提出，以免國會中發生波折。蘆田內閣於七日宣佈總辭後，國會衆議院議長松岡駒吉卽於八日訪民主自由黨總裁吉田茂，探詢繼組新閣意見，並分訪社會黨，國民協同黨，民主黨，社會革　黨領袖，促成五政黨領袖會議，交換成立聯合政府意見。民自黨對五黨領袖會談，先是抱拒絕的態度，後又同意於十日上午在衆院松岡議長室舉行·看一般情勢，民自黨總裁吉田茂出而領導組閣，殆無疑義：而目前所面臨的問題，卽在組織聯合政府抑一黨政府。這個有關政府形式的問題，關係今後日本政治動向至大，値得我們深切注意。</p>
<p>蘆田內閣的垮台，本為不可避免的事實。當七個月前，蘆田以片山前內閣「老店新開」的姿態出現以後，本報社評卽預料蘆田內閣仍是短命內閣，將為吉田茂舖好道路。前任片山內閣藏相後任蘆田內閣經濟安定御長栗栖赳夫，於九月州日因貪汚案被拘以來，內閣卽發生重大危機，本報十月六日社評，當卽指出日政府信譽的降落，政府與政黨的分離，蘆田內閣的命運已繫於且夕問的變化。不出我們的所料，蘆田內閣於七日宣佈總辭了，其總辭的理由稱：「栗栖大臣由於牽涉昭和電工事件而被傳審誠屬遺憾，余為內閣首班，痛感道義上之責任，以此而决意辭去內閣總理之戰」。蘆田便在這不名譽的空氣中倒下來，像褪了色的玫瑰一樣，失去了鮮艷，失云了聲光。從而為盟總讚譽爲日本巳充分民主化的政治人物，這樣的無情的倒下來，相信一生也翻不過身來</p>
<p>蘆田之倒，非蘆田曁民主黨之願。但政治是無情的，蘆田逼於種種情勢，他不能不倒，而且是不名譽的倒。原因之一，是栗栖貪汚事件牽涉廣泛，前任副首相西尾末廣，昭工電工社長日野原節三，新自由憲結成籌備會首腦小澤專七郎，三井重工業首腦佐籐，東京典獄長伊籐，民自黨工業領袖大野等，先後被拘，現任大藏省北村不久亦有被拘可能，致政府顏面無存，為明治大正以來最可恥的一次疑獄·根據西尾七日在法院的口供，首相蘆田與盜用二百萬美元公軟案有　，致蘆田啞口無言，無以應付危局，不得不實佈辭職，靜候法院解决。原因之二，是社會黨國民協同當正式宣佈撤銷對內閣的支持，一致要求蘆田總辭以謝國人。如果蘆田戀棧不捨，自失政治道德責任，社會黨將退出內閣之六省。蘆田至此，陷於孤立，不能不去。原因之三，易盟總方面不予支持。麥帥對日政潮向抱干涉態度，吉田片山兩屆內閣便是受干涉而垮台的。這次麥帥對蘆田內閣所處的境遇，忽採「不過問」政策，不願直接支援蘆田，因之蘆田失去了靠山。惟盟總力稱栗栖賄案似不應由全體閣員負責，無形中又减輕了蘆田的干係。本來，蘆田是一個最無政治責任咸的人，西尾受賄案發生後，其態度之圓滑，令人捉摸不定；栗柄貪汚案發生後，復表示不負政治責任，僅在道義上感覺遺憾，這完全不是政十治家的從政態度。蘆田內閣格於上述三種情勢而辭職，一些也不偶然或意外。產田已成為日本政治上的渣滓了，站在同盟國管制日本的立塲，我們應讓它受時代的揚棄，而毫無保留。</p>
<p>現在繼廬田內閣而出組新閣的，在法理上和情勢上看，最有可能的，是民主自由黨了。從法理上說，衆議院四六六席（空缺議員十八席）中，民主黨佔一五一席，社會黨佔一一〇席，民主黨佔九〇席，其他保守小黨派多趨向民自黨，故民自黨應為衆院的多數黨。同時吉田茂又為片山蘆田兩屆內閣的反對黨，論理應由民自黨出而組閣。從情勢上說，麥帥管制下的日本，左派政黨是不能抬頭的，一中間路綫」的片山蘆田又先後失敗，這說明「中道政治」之無路可走，當然祇有回復保守，搜向右傾，顯然是為吉田茂開關道路·吉田為頑固的外交家，其性格的崛强，甚不適合政黨政治生活，而黨內人才貧乏，該黨所有中央地方議員，均帶濃厚的財閥地主氣息，其政治主張之反動至足驚人。吉田茂所以欲組一黨內閣，不贊成多黨聯合政府，充分表現他的頑固性反動性。不過今天日本政治的習慣，多數黨組閣必需徵得麥帥同意，麥帥對於吉田本不感覺興趣，如果同意吉田出組一黨保守內閣，必將遭受盟國的批評，面且說明三年來日本民主化的失敗·麥帥與吉田的晤談，麥帥是否同意一黨保守內閣，或多黨的保守內閣，或另支持他人出而收拾殘局，重新舉行總選，尙不得而知。總之，這次日本新閣之出現，不僅為今後日本政治動向的重大考騐，抑且為盟總管制日本政策的最大考騐，我們且拭目以待。</p>

<h3>補充穩定金圓價値辦法　立委沈重宇等一二六人提案全文</h3>
<p>〔中央社南京十三日電〕立法委員沈重字等一百二十六人提議，補充穩定金圓價値辦法，以增强幣制之信用而利施行案，全文如下；</p>
<p>理由：金圓價値之能否維持，其主要原因端在信用之能否養成及生　之能否增加，當孔祥熙等承辦銀元改為法幣時，所以能推行　利者，以當時政州對於貨幣能維持信用，民衆對賃幣無惡性膨賑之恐怖，新舊幣間無折合問題，一般物價　波動之現象，故雖至抗戰事起，其幣値亦維持至兩三年之久，並未顯著下跌。無如數府旣先後以損獻蓋金及忽視　五年以前之美金儲畜券，美金公債等辦法損傷信用，復未能於外匯基金充裕時改革幣制（孔祥熙在職時尙有外匯黃金白銀折合美金九億左右，宋子文去職時亦尙餘三億以上），則今日之問題，為信用之有無，而非管制疏　。而所謂信用者，又爲信用之重新創造，而非信用之繼續繼持，故培養信用，為稽定幣　之第一事，社會含容貨幣之數量，與生產力之大小成正比例，生產力小，發行額雖少，而籌碼過剩，此為游炎作　，亦有惡性膨脹之洗弊；反之，生產力大，則發行額雖多，而皆有實物為其背景，不惟無膨腹之感，且有促進民生之利。顧今。一般生產事業，無不顯萎縮之象，卽以上海一隅而言，亦因工廠之停頓，而致電力有餘，電燈奇亮，可為明黴，須知生產萎縮，則稅源减少，財政上恃發行以維持開支之比例加大；生產萎縮，則含容幣量之能力减少，均足使社會感覺通貨之脹膨疑惑，故增加生產，爲穩定幣値之第二事。　於以上理由，謹擬補充穩定金圓券價値辦法如次：</p>
<p>（甲）關於培養發行信用者</p>
<p>（一）將現在所設之發行監理委員會擴充改緝，增加名額、其委員人選，應就全國各地區對財政金融業務著有聲望者分配　選之。</p>
<p>（說明）查我國土地廣大，交通不便，欲使全體民衆信任管理發行之機關，則此管理發行機關之人品，必須令使用金圓券之各區民衆，對之有相當認識，認為可予信任。而現在設置發行監理委會之人選，雖多知名之士，但冬偏於上海一隅，腹地及邊遠省份之人民，多屬隔膜，實有擴充改組之必要。為慮人數過多、難期敏活，可由委會中互推常務委員三人或五人，負責辦理日當事務，每半個月或一月舉行全體會議。此項發行監理委會，不僅爲監理發行之機關，其主要作用，應為重新創造發行之信用，故其職掌，應使其一，能參加掌管並應用發行凖備（下條物資在內），二，能把握發行之數量。（下文轉入第四版）</p>

<h3>韓國局勢從此愈形混沌　蘇承認北韓政權　雙方換文建立外將關係　南韓斥北韓組織非法不容出席聯大</h3>
<p>〔合衆社倫敦十三日電〕此間蘇聯無綫電十三日轉播莫斯科電台廣播：史達林總理答覆北轉人民民主共和國總理金日成稱：蘇聯願與北韓建立外交關係。</p>
<p>〔合衆社莫斯科十三日電〕蘇聯史達林大元帥及北韓部長‘會議主席金森十三日以換文方式，建立蘇聯與「朝鮮人民民主共和國」間之外交關係。常蘇政府於上月宣佈自韓國撤兵後，此舉早在意料中。其他東歐國家將繼起承認北韓。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社莫斯科十三日電〕莫斯科電台今晨宣佈，史達林元帥代表蘇聯政府，承認接獲北韓總理金日成八日致渠呼籲建立外交經濟關係以及兩國交換大使之函電。史達林在覆函中答稱：「渠一向擁護朝鮮人民成立獨立政府之權利，歡迎朝鮮人民組織政府，並願渠等努力完成復興及民主發展。」莫斯科電台又稱：史達林之覆函，係十月十二日發出。</p>
<p>〔新亞社漢城十三日電〕攎平壤廣播北朝鮮中央通訊社電訊稱：北韓各地現正連日舉行歡送蘇軍返國大會，各地並多已建起解放紀念塔及蘇軍紀念塔蘇軍基地等，在海州市，羅南，咸與，及平壤各地之市民歡送蘇軍大會中均皆高呼「韓蘇親善」等口號。</p>
<p>〔合衆社漢城十三日電〕美人一名，十二日晚自美蘇兩交界處返此間談稱：蘇軍正自交界處撤退，由北韓軍隊瓜代。北韓軍以輕武器射擊美軍，後者以重武器還擊，加以擊潰。美人以　遠鏡望見韓人一名，手足靜止，顯已身死，另一人則由同伴抬走。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社巴黎十二日電〕前往聯合國之南韓代表團今日發表公報稱：「朝鮮代表國九人現在巴黎等待時機，冀將朝鮮共和國政府事件向聯合國大會提出，朝鮮代表團曾正式請求如朝鮮問題提出討論時，朝鮮代表應參加第一委員會」。公報繼續指出：「朝鮮共和國之成立，乃由於一聯合國委員會同意並監視下之人民普選，參加選舉之人民，佔全國三分之二，其他三分之一則因蘇佔區拒絕聯合國委員會之工作而未能參加」，公報中更指出北韓政權為一自尊自封之「獨裁政權」，故在法理上北韓政權決不能代表朝鮮人民，而列席聯台國能代表人民出席聯合國大會者，惟有南韓代表團。</p>

<h3>處蘇聯控制下　東歐籌組聯盟　外將經濟合作以與西歐頡頏</h3>
<p>〔合衆社普拉格十二日電〕可靠方面十二日稱，蘇聯已決定締結東歐聯盟，以抵制西歐聯盟。組織東歐「人民民主聯盟」之決定，諒於上月中東歐各高級政治領袖在克里米亞之會議席上所決定者，不久諒將加以宣佈。</p>
<p>據稱，東歐聯盟國家將包括波蘭，捷克，匈牙利，保加利亞及羅馬尼亞等國。該計劃之策劃人，傳亦希望羅致南斯拉夫加入，雖則南國已為共產國際情報局所開除。奧境蘇聯佔領區之加入，傳亦在考慮中，至於東德之加入與否，則將在以後再加考慮，在建議中之東歐聯盟之確實形式幷未披露，但傳參加國家之數十名專家將於本週內在普拉格會議，草擬詳細計劃。東歐聯盟諒着重於經濟合作，可能以此等國家之關稅同盟及經濟計劃之長久合作為出發點。該組織將在蘇聯之管制下，但幷不合併於蘇聯，亦不成立一新國家，可能依照荷比盧三國關稅同盟之形式。各參加國家仍保留其本國政府及國外代表，而事實上業已實現之外交政策合作，則在該計劃下勢必大為加强。</p>
<h3>中澳等駐柏林軍事使團　蘇聯要求撤回</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕倫敦十三日廣播柏林訊：蘇聯曾建議中國·印度·澳洲·荷蘭等國對閉其駐在柏林之軍事使團，並撤回本國。此等派駐四强管制委員會之軍事使團至少有十五個。據蘇官方通訊社稱，關於各國軍事使團事，已由德境蘇聯司令索柯洛未斯基向美英法三國司令發表稱；「各國軍事使團係派駐四强管委會，今管委會旣不存在，則派駐之使節團亦卽無存在之可能」。據稱，西方軍事總督對於蘇聯建議，尙未宣佈其立塲。按四强管委會自三月二十日蘇聯宣佈「委員會已不復存在」以後，迄未舉行會議。同時西方列强對蘇聯片面金圖解散管制委食，亦迄未予以承認。</p>

<p>〔合衆社柏林十三日電〕柏林市政會十三日下午在蘇佔區集會後，卽宣布會址移往英佔區。</p>
<p>〔合衆社柏林十三日電〕美國執照之德文「每日鏡報」十三日載蘇佔區難民之談片稱，蘇聯已開始在前納粹軍事機關本部內駐屯新近組成之「民兵」，至少巳有八所總舊營房已重行應用。蘇方巳訓練並武裝四十萬民兵，由養織俘組成之，高度集中實理，不分省份市鎭。</p>
<h3>反對西參加聯大　我態度不變</h3>
<p>認北韓選舉為不合法</p>
<p>〔中央社巴黎十二日電〕我國駐聯合國代表蔣廷黻今稱，中國將於允許西班牙參加聯合國一間題提出討論時投反對票，因西班牙一切情况，仍如過去，中國殊輸允許參加之程序時，渠謂，允許增加新會員國，必須於安理會一中獲得五强之一致通過。至於　斯科廣播所請平壞政權要求派代表列席聯合國一問題，蔣氏稽，韓國政府乃由聯合國派遣代表監督選舉而產生，而在北韓之選舉如何進行，則為世人所不知也。</p>
<h3>蘇聯如具有和平誠意　應放棄第五縱隊　英代表向維辛斯基挑戰</h3>
<p>〔合衆社巴黎十三日電〕英代表薩克洛斯今日在聯大政委會辯論裁軍時，要太蘇聯放棄以「第五縱隊共黨之隱性軍隊」，作為軍縮計劃之一部份。蕭氏稱，蘇聯在全球維特第五縱隊一日，則其五强一年內栽軍三分之一建議，卽一日「無意義」，蓋第五縱隊旨在破壞經濟復興及製造政治混亂。</p>
<p>渠如稱，如蘇聯有誠意於信心及安定之重回大地，湖解除鐵幕，作為「攤於桌上之一張牌」，蕭氏向蘇聯挑戰稱，「貴國於要求吾人支持貴國計劃時，是否亦願訂立公約，放棄貴國之第五縱錄，並停止破壤歐亞復興之一切計劃？蘇聯卽使在國內不准有反對黨及敵視政府宣傳之存在，吾人並不反對。吾人所反對者，乃蘇聯牽綫之地下破壞及不逞宣傳。法國·中國·義大利·伊朗·印尼·馬來·其經濟復興與民主政治抬頭之努力，均被外國指導之共黨行動所阻撓。莫斯科祗須一言，該數國卽可欣欣向榮，貴國稱不希望戰爭，或許如此，然歷史證明卽希特勒亦不渴欲戰爭。然貴國希望不戰而取得勝利之果，是故資國一方面縱持强大兵力，使舉世惴惴不安，而同時在每一個國家內利用第五縱隊。」蕭氏籲請蘇聯回心轉意，在原子能及軍縮管制上讓步，並回答維一辛斯基所謂蕭維兩人意見各殊，「蓋吾人另有心胸」一節稱：「此言令人悲傷，本人希望並相信其非正確，蓋本人之心，猶如吾國之心，希望和平，非奴役之和平亦非寂滅之和平，而係全人類榮耀友善之和平。綏靖不能致此，前車之鑑班斑在目。吾將以客觀及安詳之態度，在較此為冷靜之氛圍中，用合理實際及有效之方法解決之。」</p>
<h3>馬里克反唇相稽</h3>
<p>〔太報訊〕巴黎十三日廣播：蘇代表馬里克在政委會中駁覆着克洛斯，指斥其演辭充滿「撒謊與誹謗」，「拾取托洛茨基。希特勒，戈培爾等之牙慧」。渠力言凡願與蘇聯合作者，以及需要和平與睦誼者，並無所謂鐵慕存在。馬氏稱，「蘇聯需要協調。吾人與羅斯福護致協議並無困難，但蕭克洛斯輩似不需要協議」。</p>
<h3>維辛斯基言論涉及中共　將廷黻發表聲明　指為違反中蘇條約精神</h3>
<p>〔中央社巴黎十二日電〕我國雖不欲以國內問題，在國際會議中提出討論，但過去一日中，聯大政委會在其辯論裁軍聲中，曾特別提及我國共黨之叛亂事宜。美蘇二國在繳辯對華極端不同之意見，迫使我人有所表示。我駐聯合國代表蔣廷黻所發表之聲明稱，中國絕不能接受蘇聯所提撒裁三分之一軍隊之建議，因而引起美蘇公開對華事宜之爭辯。蘇代表維辛斯基今日午後宣佈其對華之意見，而美代表奧斯汀在駁覆其他問題中，曾非正式支持我國政府。我代表蔣廷黻辯論維氏對華攻擊之言論稱，此舉純屬無聯。此間我國人士稱，「維辛斯基之指責，直接違反中蘇條約內蘇聯以精神或物資支持中國政府之各款，」</p>
<h3>法代表提出　裁軍新建議政委會辯論結束</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社巴黎十三日電〕聯大政委會今晨十時五十分繼續開會，討論蘇聯裁軍案。法代表巴洛迪宣佈渠動議起草一項議案，將迄今為止之一切辯論要點，皆包括於內。該議案稱，聯大會湖向安理會建議下列數事：（一）成立一管制機構，此一機構管制根據各國政府在一定時期內向該管制機構所提出有關該國兵力及舊武器數量之聲明而加以管制，並由管制機構對各國政府聲明中所述各點實地調查，並由聯合國秘書處將上述聲明公佈之。（二）促成逐步普遍限制武備及習用武器。（三）製造有關此事之報吿書，其時間不得遲於討論此一建議之下一次常會召開之時，以便大會能根據憲章所規定之裁軍目的與原則，進行其活動。至此烏克蘭代表曼紐斯基要太結束辯論，謂此項辯論「引導吾人捲入純理論之討論，」，主席史巴克表示同意，渠稱，冗長演說無補於問題解決。最後經各代表動議結束辯論，以卅一票對五票（十一票棄權）通過該案，政委會遂於午十二時五十五分休會。</p>
<h3>潘迪特夫人　將調任駐美使節</h3>
<p>〔中央社倫敦十三日合衆電〕頃自權威方面獲悉，印總理尼赫魯之妹，現任印駐蘇大使潘迪特夫人，將調任美大使。潘迪特夫人現為出席聯大印代表團長，會後返印，小休後，將卽赴華府履新。</p>
<h3>美國軍事準備　旨在防止戰爭</h3>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓十二日電〕美陸軍作戰計劃部長魏德邁將軍今日宣稱，美國擴軍之目的，在阻止戰爭，幷不準備作戰。魏氏在電視廣播中發表「美國接近戰爭至何程度」之演說。魏氏並未對此題作直接之答覆，但稱，美睦軍正在從事以爭取和平及安全力量之方法阻止戰爭。外界譴責美陸軍支配美外交政策乃不確實者。美外交政策係美。人民所造成者，幷不是陸軍部。美國國策係由總統，國會及國務部所決定，當人民不贊同行政當局所採取之若干政策時，外交政策卽迅速予以科正。美睦軍部與外交政策有關唯一之事，卽為保證吾人支持在國內外之政策而已，此乃吾入所有武裝部隊之眞諦。</p>

<p>〔法國新聞社巴黎十二日電〕安理會中六「中立國」今日繼續幕後活動，企圖調解柏林危機，下次安理會似將延期至星期六或下星期舉行。據消息靈通方面稱，西方三國雖仍堅持開始談判前，首須解除柏林封鎖，然蘇聯建議「同時進行」之　亦可能被接愛。中立外將方面指出談判與解除封鎖同時進行，實為解開柏林死結之唯一辦法。安理會主席阿根廷外長勃拉馬格里亞正在等待蘇方對渠之建議之　　。</p>

<p>〔新亞社東京十在日電〕日本下屆首揆之提名選舉，延期一日後，應於十三日下午舉行，惟本日下午五時三十五分衆議院議院營委員會召開會議之結果，決定再延期一日‘至十四日舉行。在該會議上，民自黨方面雖曾提議十三日夜舉行，而民主黨方面則以尙有需檢討之點，提出延期至十四日舉行。依照民自黨方之要求，六時十五分暫時休會，會議重開後，容納各黨之意見，決定再延期一日，七時七分散會。</p>
<p>〔中央社東京十三日電〕謠傳業被視為「最可能之首相候選入」之吉田茂，可能遭擯棄。傳民主自由黨幹事長山崎猛，業破目為「適宜候選人」，但本日午後，一山崎猛曾發表聲明，直率否認有一繼任首相之任何企圖。渠吿議會內其本黨議員稱：「卽令被指派，余亦將永不接受首相職位。」</p>
<p>〔新亞社東京十三日電〕日民目黨首席總務星島二郎十二日下午曾訪晤民主黨幹事長苦米地，商談下屆內閣問題。據傳關於民自黨所主張之保守統一戰綫政策與民主黨所主張之舉國一致政策之如何妥協問題，星島希望民主黨在組閣方法上稍稍讓步，而民自黨願在閣僚比數及位置方面對民生黨讓步。據一般推測，此項黑市談判如仍不能謀致妥協，則首揆提名時，民主黨恐全投白票　〔合衆社東京十三日電〕由於許多政界人仕認為吉田茂係「反動份子」而繼續加以反對，已使吉田被選為新首湘之預定把握，為之延擱。當盟總員宣稱：新首相人選之決定，完全為日人本身之事務時，若干日本政界人仕卽已散佈謠言稱，麥帥不希望吉田再度出任首相。投吉田在一九四六年五月曾由天皇裕仁根機舊，　　　　　　　　　　　　任首相，至一九四七年五月倒　。依照以往國會之程序，當國會中缺乏明顯之大多數黨時，多數黨領袖將被選爲有相，如此則吉田當爲最適當之人選，因民主自由黨在衆院之四百六十六議席中，佔有一百五十一席。但吉田之反對者則辯稱：因渠係反動份子，渠之當選將產生不良之國　響，吉田之支持者則力促國會於十三日召開衆　全體會議，選舉首相俾在反對人仕未組成集國阻　其當選之時，進行選舉。按任何候選人如獲衆院三分之一之選票，卽可當選。據稱：倒閣之前首相蘆田，亦反對吉田，其主因則由於過去二人聞之長期競爭。</p>

<h3>配售魚鮮商定辦法　今日起統籌分配　魚販無須再排隊</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕本市魚業方面，前因魚市塲全體經紀人指責魚販同人聯益會破壞配給魚貨制度，嗣魚販聯益會又提出反駁·指經紀人勾結黃牛操縱魚價，致一度引起糾紛，魚市塲為調解兩者間衝突，昨特邀集經紀人公會，魚販聯益會，漁輪公會，靑年服務總隊第十四大隊，及有關漁業各團體，在該塲舉行會議。會議重心集中如何改善配貨方法，及全力消滅黑市魚貨問題。魚販聯益會表示目前魚貨正值淡季，到貨不多，而每日排隊等候配購之魚販均在四千人以上，因不敷分配，往往有半數魚阪無法購到，致市區內有幾處魚鮮充寒，而有幾處則完全無貨。黑市魚價因此發生，故要求加以改善。嗣討論結果，決定具體辦法八點，擬俟早奉當局核准後實行。其中卽將自今日開始實行者，為各魚販無須再行排隊，祇須於先一日下午一時至四時往市塲登記，領取職貨證，依次按魚貨多寡統籌分配。聞該業今日午後仍假市漁會開會，續商有關配貨等問題。</p>

<h3>叛決理由</h3>
<p>高院判決該案理由：（一）朱罪，原判四年，改判三年，係根據嵩山警察分局局長宋廷均證稱：「事先並未謀議，純係臨時起意。」則朱並非「首謀」，自堪認定，原判以首謀之罪論科，似嫌未合。（二）曾志剛，潘志光，原判三年六月，改判一年半。因兩人均非首犯，情節較朱霏為輕，自應從輕處斷。（三）李美娟，阮劍敏，趙阿慶，顧克仁，原判一年，改判六月。盧家麟，俞志琴，李英，王富林，朱財根，施梅芳，原判五月，改判六月。原判僅認為有毀損公物之行為，但亦屬實施强暴脅迫之一種，與毆打員警事同一例，不能謂無意思之連絡，顯與宣施强暴脅迫，妨書公務有通帶關係，自應從一重處斷，不能僅以毀損公物論科。　程實康，秦嫻芬，金英均朱滿十八歲·依法减刑，且未受徒刑之宣吿·認為以不執行為適當，核與緩刑條例相符。（五）李根芳，徐節才，夏少棠，王賢良，孟燕，孫致敏，金美虹部份：被吿等始終否認有共同在塲實施强暴脅迫之情事，經綢查該上訴人雖無其他暴行，而在塲助勢則已極顯明，亦均無免罪之可能·姑念該上訴人等，均未受徒刑之宣吿，經本院合議，以不執行為原則，應予緩刑·惟金美虹未達法定年齡，依法减輕其刑，再予緩刑。（六）關於駁回上訴部份：俞金寶，趙正祥二人，經初審時依刑法一三六條第一項及一三八條從一處斷，處有期徒刑一年，尚無不當，應認上訴無理由，予以駁回。又陳阿鉀部份，素未犯罪，亦與緩刑條例相符，殊以暫不執行為適當，自應論知緩</p>

<h3>黃品發發明　三輪車里程計算表</h3>
<p>近來三輪車夫望天討價，市民深以為苦，機械師黃品發經月餘之研究，頃已發明「里程計算表」一種。黃氏於昨日持至中央銀行晋謁督導員蔣經國，蔣氏特派警局副局長張師延見。對黃氏發明之里程計算表頗為嘉許，允代轉市府社局及公用局備案。該「表」頗似普通鐘表，表面共有一至十二數目字，止有長短針各一，長針迴轉一圈，等於行走一英里，短針迴轉一圈，等於行走十二英里，里程表裝置於車座靠手左側，其中機件裝置於三輪車及人力車之地軸上，車輪一經轉動，里程機上之長針卽自行轉動，以後如當局訂定三輪車每哩之車價後，乘客可於上車及下車前，看明里程表上所指之里程，給付車價，旣極公允，且可减少許多車夫與乘客間無謂之爭。</p>

<h3>燃管會案首次開庭　全日審訊達八小時　楊耘夫供稱管配愁依舊例辦理　孫繼策否認分潤黑市煤價差額</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕前上海區燃料管理委員會運輸處長楊耘夫及該會統配處長孫繼策等，勾結煤商）貪汚舞弊一案，地院謝志英推事，昨晨九時在刑八庭初審，提到被吿燃管會述輸處長楊耘夫，科員兼煤商鄒濟道，退伍軍官趙伯鈞，煤商毛梅軒及前燃管會統配處長孫繼策，科長林克楹，科員繆綬紫，戴偉華，辦事員徐葆光，任輝，江浙內河輪船公司庶務孫志剛，煤商韓承溥等十二人，並傳證人潘宗禮，黃韻聲，周星煌，陳松壽，包瑞珍（女），嚴阿章，虛受臣，俞闕金，蔡和賢，葛建華，愼鐵實，李華卿，張天才，陳仁壽等十餘人，及經辦本案之市政府調查處職員唐克約，樂莊新，曁經警大隊行動組長王思祖等到庭應訊，另有其他應傳證人賀稚英，施堅忍，汪劍平，馬忠良，陳棟，陸志達，謝文光，池雲飛，王欽飛，邱同文，陳志張等二十餘人，均未到庭。昨晨自九時開庭至下午六時許審畢，除午間休息一小時，全日審訊，計長八小時，猶未　結，定於二十日開庭再審。</p>
<p>本案昨日開審，被吿家屬出席旁聰者二百餘人，座無虛席，楊耘夫所聘諸之辯護律師，竟達六人之多，全庭空氣嚴肅，頗現緊張。謝推事陞座，依次提被吿到庭點名，詢問年籍後，當卽宣稱：各被吿以前旣均未犯罪，此次被控，應坦率陳述，犯罪或因一時錯誤，法律可予寬恕，若答供閃避，一經調查確鑿，判處加重。言訖遂對各被開始審訊。</p>
<p>互將款證時被拘捕</p>
<p>第一被告楊耘夫著褐色西服，面呈憂戚之色，首應訊稱：曾在湘黔，黔桂兩路任職，三十六年六月二十日出任燃管會運輸處長，負責保管煤斤，運輸則由船舶處負責，台灣，開灤，華東，淮南等四礦產煤，均由該會採辦及配售，尚有其他各礦煤產，則由煤商自由購運。該會管配辦法，悉依舊例辦理。趙伯鈞次應訊供稱：二七二年在軍校十期畢業，曾任軍委會別働隊上校團長，去年退役後，由國防部馬某介紹，得職楊耘夫，初無接洽運煤情事，後因在本市中央飯店之人民團體「益社」任交際組長，與軍校三期同學，現任市府調查處職員陳志强相識，陳對渠稱：有非煤商之友人擬往天津運煤，須備採購證，請為設法，渠乃商諸楊耘夫，楊卽介紹公大煤號申精代領，陳願納三十億元，作為完稅之保證金，渠興陳之友人，始終未見過，於九月十四日在皇后咖啡館亙交款證時被抽，始知為陳對渠挾嫌陷害</p>
<p>唐克鈞述破案經過</p>
<p>須由奉命設計破獲本案化名湯更生之市府調查處職員唐克鈞證稱：兩月前卽奉命調查燃管會舞弊案，佯對陳志强稱有友擬向天津運煤五百噸，陳答有同學趙某常代人申領採購證，當允給手續費三十億元，作為酬勞，一面呈准上級，於舊歷八月七日先付五億，趙約十三日在老正興菜館會面，將餘款交訖後給證。屆期老正興有週密佈置，而趙稱採購證須於次日始能領到，約十四日至皇后咖啡館晤面，屆時趙與女友包瑞珍先在，遂將採購證交出，渠先將款二十五億交付陳志强，陳實付趙二十二億（內三億為陳之回扣）。款證互交後，旋由行動組長王思祖率警當塲人贓並獲，帶局偵訊，繼由王思祖陳述，對唐克鈞化名破案，及唐所付之款，事前如何將號碼記錄等情形，證述甚詳。庭上繼訊鄒濟道，據供：前為煤商，後因煤業公會介紹，在燃管會任科員，並與毛梅軒合股開設公大煤號，在會負責調查煤斤及價格之職，與趙伯鈞素不相識，以公大名義申請採購證，係楊耘夫囑辦。</p>
<p>給車馬費或有其事</p>
<p>至此，庭上遂傳詢市府承辦人樂莊新，提供證據，樂稱：楊耘夫在警局曾供公大並代替其他商人申請採購證，及楊常向鄒濟道借款等語。楊辯稱：代人申請採購證，係代人在會催促發證之誤。向鄒借款偶而有之，並無其他金錢來往。庭上以主管向屬員借款，斥為怪事。</p>
<p>時至中午，退庭休息，至一時十分，繼續開處，對鄒濟道向各煤商索賄事，反覆追訊。楊耘夫供稱：去年華東，淮南兩礦增產達七萬餘噸，煤商圖利，向南京設法請准採購，由京運滬，陳啓天部長曾面諭上海煤荒，授意對於商運，可酌予放寬；煤商報請查驗。為求迅捷，付鄒軍馬費或有其事。庭上繼就市府所抄獲之各項支票照片，詢問鄒濟道·據稱：其中七千四百萬支票一紙，係由繆綏紫代領楊之薪款·其餘各支票則為繆綬紫·戴偉華·徐葆光·任輝等託售之五担煤球賬款，並否認向煤商索賄分款。</p>
<p>知為賄款心照不宣</p>
<p>庭上傳詢在該會任職之某局情報員陳仁壽，陳稱：據查煤商運煤，均由張錦記報關行張人才代收手續費，每噸失收二萬至八萬元不等，以後續有遞增。八月十七日鄒曾以拆息名義付渠四千二百萬元，八月二十二日得金圓十四元，九月六晶得金圓二十五元四角，當時因不願暴露身份，故未追問各款之來源，收後卽呈交市政府，其他同事亦得同數之款，彼此或知其為賄款，均心照不宣。嗣煤商周星煌·黃韻聲·潘宗禮·虛受臣·葛建華·陳松壽等相繼應訊，均稱有付給張錦記報關行款項，多少不等，作為鄒濟道車馬費情事，詢諸張天才，亦不否認。</p>
<p>根據三項標凖配煤</p>
<p>庭上次就孫繼策等在該處任職期間，對於商人申請配購煤斤索賄，或將餘煤轉售黑市，分潤利益部份，加以審訊。供應黑市煤之韓承潯供：黑市煤多由輪船公司將其餘煤棧單供給，與燃管會無關。孫繼策辯稱：配給輪船公司用煤，根據下列標準：（一）江海輪，根據其航程，噸位配賦，連招商局在內，每月配購二萬八千餘噸，（二）內河輪，約數十家，每月配購千餘噸，（三）拖駁輪，約十餘家，每月配購數百噸。對於賀稚英等任經理之輪船公司，係照舊案辦理，經申請調查後核配，並未多配，先為四百七十五噸，後改為三百七十五噸，並　認分潤市價與黑市價之差額。韓承溥供稱：間賀稚英及在劍平等有送賄款情事，但知而不詳。江浙輪船公司庶務孫志剛供認去年年夜及今年端午節曾奉命購辦禮物洋酒香烟等致送孫·林等，惟否認有送賄款情事。最後審訊申江輪局沈金福，德泰程鈺光，元負嚴阿章，普益愼鐵寅，華大李華卿等，各就該輪船公司將餘煤委由韓承溥轉售黑市情形，有所供述，庭上以尚有若干重要證人，未能到庭，諭令改期再審，各被吿還押，至下午六時許始吿退庭。</p>
<h3>解救公用事業煤荒　請設健全調配機構</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕據公用局消息：本市烟煤調節供應處，因礦商之要求，已擬定一新調整配價計算辦法，呈中央核准後施行。公用局為解救煤荒，日前特召集公用事業公司負責人商討辦法，擬由各公司直接向礦商訂購，惟公司方面因運輸困難，須有專門機構負責辦理，乃決電請中央立卽設立健全之調配機構，統籌配煤，並設煤棧以備不時之需。</p>
<h3>補充穩定金圓價値辦法　上接二版</h3>
<p>（二）政府應卽制定並公佈收支平衡之財政具體計劃，以消除人民對新幣膨脹之疑慮。</p>
<p>（說明）查人民對金圓劵之發行，如尚有繼續膨脹之恐怖心理，則幣值無從維持，財政如無收支平衡辦法，則恐怖心理無由消滅。根據財政主管人員之報吿，自本年七月至年底之軍政費支出，（數目已於本屆第一次秘密會由財政部長報吿），比美援為少，充其量，財政上之負擔，不過戰時之特別支出。然一月以來，香港電匯旣聞復生黑市，國內各地物價亦大多波動，政府雖以强力管制，而物價貴賤問題，乃一變而為物資之多寡問題，若猶不設法改善，恐將再變而為物資有無問題，其最大原因，卽在財政收支平衡之未能俾衆週知，而民衆對發行膨脹之恐怖心理未能消滅所致。夫短期內之財政旣可以美援使其容易平衡，正可明白宣佈，現在收支已經平衡，將來財政亦有合理計劃，使舉國咸知，則幣信易立，幣值穩定，當非難事。</p>
<p>（三）應將發行準備基金與八月十九日以後所收兌之金銀外幣，全數集中，為有計劃之運用，掌握民生必需之物資，分區出售，以維護生產，供應民用，穩定物價，鞏固幣值。　（說明）查金圖劵旣係管理貨幣，則其幣值與信用之表現，不在呆置保管庫內之金銀外匯之準備金，而在能否長期以穩定價格購得所需之貨物，能如是，雖無分毫之準備金，則人民必對此幣視如拱璧，安心信用；不能如是，則庫內雖有發行十足之金銀外匯準備，人民均必認為與幣值幣信毫無關速，此理至淺，無待贅陳。按戰前歷年海關統計，每年進口物資總值均在三億美元，以現在美金貶值在五折以下，而我需要之物品種類較前為多，但我之幣值穩定，應從未淪陷之區域着手，掌握物資，應以日用必需品為限，估計一年所需，亦不應在三億美元以上，除去已有之美援物資不再訂購外，一年內需要訂購者，其購價必遠在三億美圓以下，如由政府責成中央銀行與發行監理委員會運用準備金，訂購國外日用必須品之原料或成品·連同美援，分由天津，上海，廣州，漢口，電慶，昆明等埠分售於谷地工廠及各縣市鎭，再就各地規定零售價之標準·此項管制，有物可管，不徒管人，則進口貨與工廠製成品之價格不再波動·而幣值因之穩定·再由中央銀行以售得之金圓購入出口貨，並鼓勵出口商協同努力，復以出口貨所得外匯訂購進口貨，則各地物價旣可以長期穩定，而幣值目臻鞏固·同時因物價穩定，則出口貨必可激增，深信國家所能控制之外匯亦必更為增多，所裨助於幣值幣信必尤大·停止發行五角之銀輔幣，所有一元以下之角輔幣悉用鎳質，一角以下之分輔幣悉用銅質。</p>
<p>（說明）前條已說明金圓券幣值幣信之維持，不在準備金之有無，準此而論，更不在輔幣是否採用金銀鑄造，更不可迷信銀輔幣兌現，恒為穩定幣值之工具，蓋現在旣定黃金，白銀，外匯，均歸國有，如再予兌現，無論所兌者為黃金，為白銀，抑為外匯，均與國有之說相衝突，且如人民鬣視金銀而輕視紙幣之觀念，不能以充裕物資穩定物價之方法，使其澈底改變，則無論有若干銀輔幣，均必迅速被人兌盡，國家焉有如許存銀以資應付，一旦兌盡之後，究將何以善後。况目前銀輔幣旣將含銀量减至原有銀元所含之若干分之一，不啻明吿全國，今之金圓只能等於銀元若干分之一，則官吏士兵之待遇，照戰前計算已感觖望，再照戰前折扣支給、更遭非議，是欲以白銀穩定幣值者，反以速其貶值，此種與白銀國有政策相矛盾，而又有貶損幣值之銀輔幣辦法實萬不可行。</p>
<p>（乙）關於增加生產者</p>
<p>（一）規定改制以前生產事業之所有資產折合金圓抵充資本之辦法。</p>
<p>〔說明〕查戰前生產事業之資本額，大者逾千萬，小者亦非數萬元不辦。抗戰以還，幣值逐漸低落，生產事業之資金逐漸增加，但多為法幣數千萬，多至數億，其以千百億計者乃絕無僅有。生產事業固定資產，所佔資金為數至大，其流動資金因歷年貨幣貶值，早已化為烏有，而借入流動資金時在改制以前，國家銀行及商業銀行常以資本不足，或負債太多，為不允借之理由，今之生產事業，假使其改制前之資本為法幣十億元（事實上極少達到此數目者），合為金圓不過三百餘元，實不成其為事業，無法以對原有投資人，更不易再集新資本。擬從新將其改制前之固定資產合理折合為金圓，為其現有之資本額，然後再令其籌集一部份現金，作為流動資金，俾各項生產事業有繼續經營之可能。</p>
<p>（二）由政府訂立提倡及維護生產事業之有關各項辦法，以發展生產，增進民生，培養稅源。</p>
<p>〔說明〕查各項生產事業之長成，其結果自皆有裨於財政，然在尚未長成之時，必須先予扶助提倡，以促其成就，斷不能因圖一時財政上之收益（有時並不妨稍有支出）而影響事業之生存，故在改制期內，訂立提倡及維護生產事業辦法，實為根本要圖，其原則為：一，規定生產事業之資金融通辦法；　，規定生產事業技術人員，由政府培養儲備辦法；三，規定生產事業保本保息辦法；四·規定生產事業擴充時之免稅减稅辦法等。要之，政府此次改革幣制，事先規劃為求嚴密神速，故措施辦法不免疏漏，自屬可諒，今後應如何補草完備，使幣值幣信益義鞏固，以維全民族之利益，本黨同人，自有應盡之職責。爰就愚慮所及，擬具上項補充辦法，是否有當，敬候公決。</p>

<h3>就全局看青島</h3>
<p>— 本報特派員　邵愼之</p>
<p>〔本報靑島八日航訊〕在目前局勢下，這個問題巳爲京滬及南方關心時局的人士急迫提出·其內含頗為複雜，但大致說來，可分兩方面：一為軍事的，一爲經濟的，並牽涉到國際問題。</p>
<p>記者重來靑島，觀察所得雖多，但可談者則似乎甚少。濟南之戰直接影響全局，而不直接影響靑烏，能影響靑島的，是全局，而非濟南·說人心鎭定，是的·極鎭定，在鎭靜中觀大局·說人心不鎭靜，則在經濟，暗盤　躍，其數字之龐大，實足令南方人震驚。</p>
<p>走私物咨偶有破獲</p>
<p>戰爭自犬牙交錯之戰演變為大規模陣地戰與運戰的配合，物資的消耗也是大規模的·靑島正如烟台一樣，偶然破獲的走私物資，大部是油，外科藥品，硫磺硝芒，以及煉鋼原料，甚至軍火。靑島在物資走私交通中，意味着何等重要的作用·（另一方面則是漏稅的美貨出現於市塲，有些商人又在鵠候特種艦隊的到來了。）政治的方法逃不過經濟的原理，高物價在何處，物資便洗向何處，這是個嚴重的實現。</p>
<p>美軍中的華籍職員，認為來歷不明的，兩週來已有一大批被解雇，隨時準備的通知，用單純的軍事觀點可以論斷靑島軍港的有用性，但如以靑島的維持現狀係美軍的艦船和陸戰隊的關係，這種純軍事的估計顯然不甚可靠。如果不是美國的政策允許，可以向別一個國家的叛軍施用國家武力，軍略要求趕不上政略要求時，則未來的情勢便很難說，但大致上是可以判斷的。西太平洋艦隊或將要開來的特種艦隊的份量是一樣的，並不特別驚人，其現有的四百部車輛，足可在數小時內協助運走所有陸上人員及僑民</p>
<p>濟南來人談「濟戰」</p>
<p>新軍某師已在前日由台抵此登陸，原駐的兩個師也要加以新裝備。綜合自濟來人所談獲得印象，濟戰規模，僅及濰縣什一，所毀者惟房屋數棟。山東人士常發不平鳴：地方團隊的勤務與國軍一樣，而待遇却大有分別，而日政府規定地方團隊，凡作戰有功者得昇補國軍，表面上似在鼓勵地方團隊，實則無異要他們永建「吊而浪當」，蓋地方團隊就是不願意離鄕背土，故濰縣之戰是個典型的例子。希望中央注意靑烏、</p>
<h3>九月份餓死者十月份救不知　龔學遂受譴責</h3>
<p>半島市民注意麵價的高低與其有無，較之這類問題的得失尤感重要。市長龔學遂一度成與論界的衆矢之的，因限價後，全市置不到糧食，市民挨餓，呌苦連天，而倉庫中公私存糧不下百萬包，配售拖延了一個月，檢查倉庫亦雷聲大，雨點小，當局賭咒必定不賣豪門資本或軍需資本的賬，這樣也鼓吹了一個月。挨餓之後，發為駡聲，其間當局突然一次拋售五千袋應市，造成搶購潮，落入黑市糧食之手。大沽路上擠得頭破血洗，龔學遂復撥麵粉三百袋予華新紗廠，作為打漿之用，不成周章，衆議譁然。一羣參議員預備和襲學遂大鬧一塲，孰料龔氏爐火純靑，自認荒唐，並謂實因事情太忙，弄出錯誤，對於各種正反意見一概稱是，把一羣議員弄得啼笑皆非而退。變成一個官塲挿曲</p>
<p>但問題並未因此解決。ECA中國分署靑島辦事處代表歐奧也向龔提出了一連串質問，認為九月份的配售不應拖到十月，說「九月份餓死的人，十月份便救不活。」靑市配售的卅六萬袋麵粉，百分之四十出諸ECA，物主極為認眞，所以弄出一些蹩扭。</p>
<p>「數米為炊」的情勢</p>
<p>再則是配售僅每月每人十五斤，決然是吃不够的，餘糧要求諸嚇人的黑市。這兩天在查倉庫，查出四十餘萬袋，據說將照限價應市，以補十五斤配量之不足，但究仍由商店發售或由民調會照配，頗費考慮。可是這些粉只能供一月之需，下月份就發生了問題，糧商例在每年九十月為採辦旺季，以備過冬，本年都裏足不前，除非政府能保證其利潤，而在南方是否能依限價購得，也是問題。大米黑市價格較上海高五倍，眞到了數米為炊的地步。</p>
<p>一千五百噸大米要飛東北去。局勢逐漸向南推移，瀋陽的糧食要由靑島起運了，兩個多小時的空中航程，經過渤海海峽旅大上空。一千五百噸大米要運一個多月。寥寥幾架CAT的飛機穿梭而行，和柏林的空運規模比起來簡直有如兒戲，所以蘇機示威的新聞也就無非如此。</p>
<p>軍略要求與政略要求是矛盾着的，是遠離，是接近，但主導者是什麼呢？這是可怕的問題。</p>

<h3>淮南鐵路　水合段通車</h3>
<p>— 本報記者　寶白萍</p>
<p>〔本報合肥十一日訊〕當江淮平原　得秋收，安徽邊緣匪燄正張的時候，淮南鐵路水家湖到合肥七十公里的一段正式復軌通車了。這是該路修復幹綫第一期工程的完成，雨天成為孤城的合肥對外交通的喜訊，也是淮南煤將有迅速運輸支持長江上下游動力的開始。提起</p>
<p>淮南鐵路令人有不盡滄桑之感，它起自淮河南岸的田家菴，經大通九龍崗兩個礦區，及水家湖，合肥，巢縣，以達蕪湖對江和縣屬的裕漢口，全長二百一十四公里。戰前勘定淮南礦區時，因為所產煤焦，須籍淮河水道運到蚌埠，轉由津浦路車運而達浦口，運程紓緩，費用浩大，乃有淮南鐵路的建築，貫通江淮，用利煤運，並發展皖北皖中且聯　皖南的交通，二十二年冬季開始勘測，二十四年年底全綫竣工，二十五年一月正式通車。次年抗戰開始，這條路先破壞於「焦土」，再折毀於日本人，勝利後已公公賸下光桿路基。現在修復，除掉路基不須重建外，一切等於新造。</p>
<p>日本人佔領期間，淮南礦被挖掘得一榻糊塗，接收後礦路公司大半心力用之於煤礦整理，兼之鋼軌，枕木，車皮，一切材料，在在都需要錢，而在在都因公司沒有錢而成問題，路遂在大家焦急的期待中，一直擱置下來了。　水家湖至蚌埠的一段，六十公里，這原是在</p>
<p>淪陷期間日本人把水家湖至裕溪的幹綫拆建所成，勝利時又被匪劇烈破壞了。路局局長吳競淸在雙十節水合段通車典禮中報吿，他說：三十四年十一月從日本人手裏只接收來從田家菴到水家湖二十七公里鐵路，三處殘破車站，與一未完成的機廠和三百輛破舊車輛，此外，他只帶有一面國旗和兩三位接收人員，就在這樣情形下，他做了淮南鐵路局長。當時，千頭萬緒，百孔千瘡，然而，煤運軍運貨運，一樣需要路的，於是着手修復水蚌段，三十五年春間動工，六月一日通車，但是這段路由於日本人倉卒建築，路基橋涵工程不合標準，勉强行車，險象環生，不能儘量運用，同年冬天水涸時期，又擬改善計劃，加建護坡，增舖道碴，橋樑加做護坡及衛固工事，這才把水蚌間的路增完好，不再終日提心吊膽。雖然煤運經蚌埠轉津浦路</p>
<p>分運南北但礦路本身是飽嘗深沉的苦悶的，據說運煤到浦口，付給津浦路運費是相當昂貴，又因車皮調度要配合津浦路行車時間，亦有難以補償的浪費，再者從礦到浦口，車皮一次週轉需要三天，而拿到水裕段上，十二小時就可週轉一次，在效率上整整是六與一之比。這許多問題打擊着礦局在他們是最為委曲的。因此，水裕段復軌，在他們本身是有無比迫切的需要，江淮間交通更是無用說的。</p>
<p>今年雙十節合肥東間外黑烟繚繞晴空，一零九號車頭拖着頭二三等客車，像長體爬蟲一般來到了，整整十一年，這個任重致遠的怪物，重現在合肥人眼裏，每個聽到汽笛長鳴的人，都同樣興奮偷快，所企望的火車，今天畢竟通了！</p>
<p>水合段路基橋樑破壤，比之合裕段更甚，復軌以前，三十五年春天完成初步測繪工作，次年十二月複測，平均每天測量三公里，今年一月二十四日完竣。繼卽着手修橋，這等於是兩項工程，因為水合交通從勝利到最近，一直以汽車在鐵路基上維持，修橋依然不使交通中斷，每修一橋，還得在旁邊搭一便橋讓汽車通行。這段內大橋共六座，長二二一點九八六公尺，小橋十一座，長五三點八四五公尺，為便利兩側農田水利，又增建涵管三十七道，直到今年七月橋工才吿完成。又因路基行駛汽車日久失修，石碴深入路床，路面高低不平，邊坡也多坍陷，翻修整理，七月二十二日開始進行舖戰工程。</p>
<p>一切工程都按照將能部制定的中墓民國鐵路建築標準及規則頭設計，路基就按該標準乙級鐵路規定辦理，最銳曲度為四度，最陡坡度為百分之一，直綫路堤寬度為五公尺，路塹寬度爲四點五公尺，軌這則採用三十七公斤型新軌，軌距為標準軌距一四三五公　，枕木採用200×150×2440的美松枕木，正綫每公里舖枕木一六八〇根，鋼軌在正綫上通用錯接，車站內採用平接，車站重要轍岔皆為十號，次要蜷綫用八號，岔車站股道有效長度定為四六零公尺，股道中心間距多為四點五公尺，道碴厚度在枕木面下為零點一五公尺。在如此設計標準下，七月二十日開始舖軌工程。</p>
<p>正日烈日炎炎的夏天，寒署表水銀柱經常在華氏一百度間上下，為了修復這段路，四百多位員工成天在洗汗，有時還會受傷流血，每一顆小石子，每一條鋼軌，每一個枕木，第五株電桿，都經過他們汗手血手撫摸過，洗過血汗不算，有時疾病還要向他們襲擊，然而他們勇往直前，毫不懈怠，一直把五千五百八十公噸鋼軌，十三萬一千根枕木，一百六十六公噸道釘，三十二公噸螺絲，一萬三千三百副魚尾板，三十三副道岔，一千四百二十根電桿，一齊各乙各位安排在七十公里的路基上，這才完成了任務。九月二十二日正午，這批每日前進一公里半的鐵路英雄到達合肥站中綫，比預定時間還提早了六個小時。</p>
<p>通車典禮中，吳局長細數着施工經過，特別點出參加舖軌工程的人員姓名，他一共點了十五人，計為正工程司兼工務處長李經會，副處長兼工程課長吳炎，正工程司陸鳳山，柳新民，副工程司王永民，’帮工程司張浩淸，唐濤同，奧日新，邵克儉，劉伯之，柴蘭田，鄭崇慈，車務處副處長劉　經，水合車務段副段長韓作新。　務督察何顯光。當這些鐵路英雄應名出現在主席台前時，每位臉上都被太陽晒得黝黑，顯示出舖軌時的辛苦，吳局長滿臉笑容向他們說：「你們是舖軌最辛勞者，將來每個旅客坐在火車裏一定會紀念你們的！」吳局長給他們每位一張感課狀，這該就是他們一塲辛苦的代價興安慰，這是光榮的！</p>
<p>今後目標是修複合肥至巢縣六十八公里的二期工程，鋼軌枕木雖已夠用，因為經費無着，幾時通車，尙不可知。礦路公司總經理程文勳，特由上海趕來參加典禮，據他談起公司經濟情况，路的前途並不是平坦無垠，加拿大一千五百萬美金貸款，緊一陣，鬆一陣，總算成功，而現在，付息，還本，復路經費，員工薪津，弄得公司每天有如過年三十，國家鐵路尙有政府補貼，而淮礦的煤價和票價，一樣受到限制，幹綫之不能平日完成復軌，卽在於沒有經這費。</p>
<p>這一個江淮大橋樑，是安徽軍事政治經濟文化大動脈，祝福合裕段工程順利前進，平日復軌，我們期待江淮平原到處有黑烟噴射長空，</p>

<h3>蘭阿煤道　煤車肇禍</h3>
<p>— 死傷達十四人</p>
<p>〔本報籣州十一日航訊〕蘭阿煤道，九日發生空前覆車慘案，傷亡乘客達十四人，除漢塲死亡三人，抬赴醫院途中死亡一人外，另一人亦甚垂危。緣有中國工業合作協會B．T．A．七號小這奇卡車一輛，受本市建華織襪廠經理孫大明雇用，於九日晨前往阿干鎭運煤，至十時許由礦區返回，除滿載煤炭外，並有乘客十餘人，行抵阿千鎭以南約五里之大水子地段，適遇另一卡車由北南來，雙方讓車時，工會汽車駛至路側，詎料路則下受河水冲刷，十質鬆軟，車遂覆陷路下河邊，四輪朝天，乘客均為煤炭及車身覆蓋，遂致傷亡十四人之多。肇禍後，司機高永林乘機潛逃，另有未受重傷之乘客數人，亦自行走去。迨至中午，始由警局阿干鎭派出所發覺，遂派員處理善後，經查明重傷七人，輕傷四人，死亡三人，傷者抬往阿干鎭醫院醫治，一人復於途中死亡。肇禍司機亦在阿干鎭緝獲，押解皋蘭縣警察局。經於十日訊問後，通知地檢處驗屍埋葬，肇禍司機及僱用人孫大明，十一日移送地檢處訊辦，據工會負責人談稱：該車爲山丹培黎學校所有，最近由山丹來蘭，將往重慶接運器材，汽車赴阿干鎭運煤一節，係司機私自受僱前往，事前工會及培校當局，概不知情。為明瞭肇禍情况及料理傷亡，工會主任郭松懋今遄赴阿千鎮。</p>

<h3>西風告緊　北雁南飛　汴市在戰憟狀態中</h3>
<p>— 本報記者　王瘦梅</p>
<p>〔本報開封八日航訊〕正是桂子飄香的時候，開封却在凄風苦雨中度了半個月悽楚的日子，當廿多萬市民在陰暗·潮濕·泥濘，霉爛中求生不得的時候，大家都咒駡着煩人的淅瀝之聲，仰首問蒼天：「你就沒有晴的時候了嗎？」　只要天晴了，秋陽的溫暖是會重回到人間的，鄕間的食糧和燒柴也會源源而來的，一切新生的希望都會隨着太陽再普照着這廿多萬市民的心坎的。大家都在不可忍耐之中等待着。</p>
<p>天終於晴了，晴的那樣好，碧澄的天空中連一點雲也沒有，嫩暖的陽光和往年一樣溫柔的普照着這秋的原野和城市。但可惜的是這晴了以後的天氣並沒有給人們帶來溫暖，沒有給人們帶來新生的力量和希望，鄉間的食糧和燒柴並沒有如大家所想像的源源而來，市面上買不到油鹽，買不到菜蔬，這裏依舊是個飢餓之城·大家沉重而憂鬱的心情不但沒被這寂寞的陽光融解，相反的因為西風吿緊，北雁南飛，這個時令與時局的威脅，已使大家又開始另一個顫慄了。</p>
<p>晴了以後的天氣，固然是秋高氣爽，可是花亂落葉　零，蕭殺之氣正如同戰爭的恐怖一肅又彌漫了這個恐怖之城</p>
<p>這幾天，街上清處都是　清行李向車站集中的架子車，車站上熙熙攘攘更是擁擠不動，好多人恐怕搭不上車，先一天晚上就把女人小孩和行李裝上那無蓬的敞車，在更深露冷中，啼飢號寒的等待着天亮開車。天亮了，後來的人們，爭先恐後的向車上爬，人上堆人，貨上壓貨，一個破機車，帶上三十節以上的車皮，節節都像泰山北斗，車頭的烟筒上是人，掛鈎上是人，踏板上是人，車箱外邊吊的也是人，車開起來像是黃牛慢步，這些因風聲緊而南飛的北雁·就在這黃牛背上讓，我吹露浸到三五日夜，才能到江南，但他們不怕這種苦痛和艱險。　其實開封週圍確實沒有一點風吹草動，劉匪主力現仍被强大國軍阻止於平漢路以西襄，郟，葉，方，舞一帶。陳匪主力則於攻陷濟南之後仍在營中一帶按兵未動，豫東和汜區一帶除了少數土共已在國軍掃蕩中外，可以說並沒有足以顧慮的匪軍，况目開封還有鐵軍名將劉汝明劉汝珍弟兄在坐鎭，然而這里事實上是在動盪和不安中。一般人都謠傳着鄭汴必要時將為徐州而犧牲，這種傳說像空谷來風，但也沒有人來制止這謠言的傳佈。這個謠傳傳播的速度，現正愈傳愈快，今天本市各報都刋載了一條黃河社的消息說：「據隴海路局有關方面人稱，該局奉交通部令浙贛京滬等鐵路急需大批客貨車輛，爲便旅客貨運起見，日內卽將該路三〇三次及三〇四次紅快貨車二百餘輛及普通客車二十餘輛，過軌江南，一部負司亦將隨車過軌服務。」於是人心更為之不安，大家都担心着時還有敞車可坐，再遲了恐遝敞車也沒有，想走也不行了。</p>
<p>這里雨是停了，但碧雲天，黃花地，秋色並不能使人迷戀，因為西風吿緊，北雁正在作南飛的態勢與準備。</p>
<h3>川西龍泉山區發現大油田</h3>
<p>— 本報記者　周學端</p>
<p>〔本報成都十一日航訊〕四川號稱天府之國，但作為國防資源的石油，蘊藏雖豐，迄無大愛發現。近資源委員會經數年考察，在距成都五十里，川西門戶的龍泉山區，發現空前大油田，油質精良，藏量豐沃；論國防價値，遠駕甘肅玉門油田之上，這在積極建設大西南聲中，實在是令人最最欣慰的一劑興奮劑。</p>
<p>油國地區</p>
<p>龍泉山，東距成都五十里，起伏綿亙，險要雄奇，兵家形勝，戰守必爭，歷來是川西門戶，成都咽喉。記者為探訪這一寳藏的發現，一度走馬參觀，到龍泉出頂的老君并。據資委會主持勘測的地質學家何殿生談：這是川西大背斜層的頂端，由此向北下降，由簡陽經金堂趙家渡，穿越沱江，達中江石泉塲。向南直至仁壽分水舖，全長一百廿公里，油藏多在嘉陵江灰岩層，成扁豆狀，厚處達三四十公尺。整個大背斜層由東北而西南向，東西兩面均有少數小型向斜層與背斜層，過去川境發現之石油，均僅在此數小型背斜層上，這次發現大背斜層，顯示四川確蘊藏最豐當的石油礦。</p>
<p>發現經過</p>
<p>這一次的發現，遠在民國卅四年，地質專家謝家榮一度到龍泉山勘測一剖面，認定該處為最理想之儲油構造區。去冬英國地質專家馬丁斯莊特來該處考察，確認極有聞採價値，返京後卽向資源委員會建議先行探測，翁文灝主委積極贊成，卽派何殿生等來川詳細考察勘測。經數月工作，發現此大背斜層橫斷面為一曾經强烈褶曲之扇形構造，頂端烈隙有大量「自然氣」逸出，在表面之老長溝郭家溝等地，各岩層均含鹽精。根據石油與天然氣及鹽共生原則，判斷此大背斜層石油區約一千五百平方公里，石油天然氣蘊量約十倍於自貢，藏鹽量亦可能十倍於自洗井區。</p>
<p>勘測計劃</p>
<p>據主持勘測的地質專家的意見：甘肅玉門油田是屬於第三紀的產油區，儲量旣不太豐富，交通運輸尤感不便利。資委會礦產勘測處久謀在川省開採發掘石油礦，先後在江油·隆昌，自洗井均有發現，但質量均不合理想，原因是這一段地帶，多接近變質岩。氷利化學公司川廠最近在五通橋鑽深井，在三千五百呎深度處發現原油藏於新地層，但經剖騐油質與油亦不太佳。惟有龍泉山區新油礦，質量不特可能為西南第一，卽比諸國內任何著名大油田，亦殊無遜色，由於這次偉大發現，證明四川今後對國防資源，必有空前供應，不愧天府之國。現在資委會決全力從事開採，先計劃立卽着手大規模打鑽工程，最低須達二千公尺以下之嘉陵江灰岩層，尋得油氣分界綫後，卽正式開採，兩川人士現正以最熱切期望，佇待這偉大工程的實施。</p>

<h3>中央銀行決定五項辦法　加強收兌金銀外幣　鄕僻地區可以利用通訊申報方式</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕自政府宣佈展延收兌金銀外幣期限後，央行為加强收兌起見，除已在未設分行各地委托國家行局庫及各省省銀行代兌外，最近並邀請國家行局及省行負責人會商技術問題。曾經決定：（一）請各省市政府轉飭縣政府下行保甲，擴大宣傳，勸導人民在限期內從速兌換，（二）鄉僻地區不便兌換，可利用通訊申報方式，各地委托代兌銀行均可接受，並應由代兌行作迅速簡明之答覆，以便送兌。（三）通訊申報與巡迴收兌工作配合進行，但巡迴收兌須俟必要時辦理。（四）各委托銀行兌得金銀外幣後，可卽就近繳送央行分行，由就近之央行發給證明書，以利繳送，另由央行向財部洽辦請領護照以資迅捷。（五）各地兌得之金銀外幣，應先集中央行分局，再行彙繳總行。</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕本市自八月廿三日至十月九日為止，央行及其委托銀行收兌之金銀外幣總額如下：（一）黃金計一百十四萬四千七百十四兩九錢零七厘，（二）白銀計九十六萬三千一百廿八兩二分六厘，（三）銀元計三百六十六萬八千四百七十三元五角，（四）銀角計三百八十四萬七千八百六十枚（雙毫），（五）美鈔計三千四百四十三萬八千八百七十二元八角九分，（六）港鈔一千零三十四萬五千七百五十三元一角七分，（七）菲幣計一萬四千三百六十四比索一角五分。</p>
<h3>存貨暫時不願轉售　紗商請准予保留　中紡昨拋紗數目甚微</h3>
<p>棉紗商業公會，前日下午召開理監事會議後，昨日該業理事長唐志良，再向督導員辦公處陳述意見兩點：（一）紗商存紗，前奉社會局通知售與複製業一節，擬請准予暫時保留，綠紗商自市塲奉令停止交易後，業務已陷停頓，該業為支持生存起見，前曾要求辦理聯合配銷，分門售與運銷外埠兩組，並要求廠方酌量關貨。茲以此項要求，迄未機定，營業方針，無從　循。目前離捕有一部份存貨，但一旦售完，而來源無着。則紗號卽將全部歡業，失業問題與商業蕭條，足以影饗社會經濟之繁榮，擬請維持員低限度之生存。（二）聯合配銷尚未實行，而該業接獲三省一市，曁漢口長沙南昌等各地複製業公會採購函件數起，亦請從早核定運銷辦法，以便遵行。</p>
<p>中紡昨循例拋紗五八九件，計金圓四六，九一八·一元，其售價為六支副日光二五五元，一〇支雙股立馬五二八元，一五支豐年五七三元，三二支陽鶴七八七元，四〇支日光八八〇元，四二支雙股立馬九九〇元，四二支雙股寶光一〇一〇元，四二支雙股彩球二等九六〇元。</p>
<p>又訊：中紡代火行拋售之廿支紗，最近暫停，原因為該批紗大部可運至國外，為南洋市塲所歡迎者，如此卽可易得大批棉花，是以央行考慮以存紗外銷。惟自央行停配後，廿支紗之供應驟感困難，紛紛要求開配，聞央行正在針劃提出六萬包中之一部，短期內繼續配售。</p>
<p>又訊：染織業公會委託棉布業配售之布，本體拜五繼續開配，惟歡目數尚未定。</p>
<p>又訊：蘇浙皖京滬區棉紡公會，本月十二十三兩日，民營廠舉行第六期第一次聯合配紗，計共配出二十支棉紗一千〇二十五件，各廠自行開售紗布彙報總額，計共開出棉布一萬五千零二十四疋，折合二十支棉紗一千零十七件。</p>
<h3>調查登記提前截止</h3>
<p>本市機器染織業公會，為協助政府澈底執行限價政策，曾奉令調查棉紗複製工業之用紗量，以便着乎改進棉紗供應，並作調劃。此種調查表之登記，原定本月十五日截止，現該會奉工業會通知，榮經物資調節委員會議決，將提前於本月十四日截止，凡屬會員，應將目前每月用紗數量，及開工情形，列表呈送該會，逾期不繳者，卽作放棄權利論。</p>
<h3>輸管會昨發表　最近輸出情形</h3>
<p>輪管會悉，本週（十月二日至八日）輸出情形，大致與上週相同。桐油因產區報升，本市存貨甚稀，脫手甚少，交易幾形停頓，出口頗呈萎縮狀態。惟國外價格，以輸管會提高出口限價而好轉。銷美行市上海FOB價格每磅仍站美金一角八分五。復據倫敦八日電訊，英國C＆F價格，散裝及桶裝每噸分別升成一五四磅及一六二磅。照本市價格計算，大可成交。</p>
<p>豬鬃市塲堅穩，人心看漲，國外行情，如上週，上海十七號FOB每磅美金二·四五元，出口亦可成交，惟不踴躍。　茶葉在海外仍多靑昧，紅茶在美蘇，綠茶在菲州，均不乏受主。本月中旬卽收有合茶九千箱運蘇，以為償債之用。但國內產量日少，品質轉差。加之日茶質量均優，卽將問鼎海</p>
<p>生絲市塲冷落，交易甚少，D級生絲FOB每磅美金二角八分·輸管會為解除生絲原料外銷困難，已商得國行同意，繼續配售生絲二百擔，協助絲織廠商，織製綢疋，以擴大外銷。</p>
<p>羽毛國內價格少變動，國外行市則稍跌。灰鴨毛及白鵝毛，FOB每磅價格，分別成美金三角八分及四角八分，照本</p>
<p>賜衣國外價格平穩，鹽豬腸FOB每付美金一角八分，但以國內價格報漲，出口利潤已較上週略降云。</p>
<h3>茶葉台鹽礦砂　分批運日易貨</h3>
<p>中央信託局之對日易貨業務，最近又將大批物資運往。第一批為茶葉及鈇皮，共有二千噸，將於後日晨運往。第二批為台靈八千噸，將於下週二運往日本神戶。第三批為湖北大洽礦砂。該項礦砂運日易貨，共有二十萬噸，迄至本月十日止，共已運出八萬　噸，在本月底以前，尚計劃發動十大輪船公司，再運往七萬五千噸，尚餘四萬餘噸，決定於下月底以前，全部運完，較原定時期，可提平一個月，關於食　一項，實為日本最需求之物資，且　政當局　為我國　產並無多餘，故今年運往數量極少。下週二運往之八千噸，為近年來最多之一次，年內可能尚有一部份食鹽運往云。</p>
<h3>市塲將易絕少做開　食米到貨銳減　汕市門銷買賣奇暢</h3>
<p>食米到貨稅减至一三六石，市塲交易絕少做開，北市自運自銷計十五石。麵粉昨未開，雜糧交易閒散，昨市只開售鄱陽子黃豆三十餘包，價十三元八角。鄱陽黑豆依限有成交，鄱陽黑蔴開售數十包，價二十八元，餘糧均朱做開。</p>
<p>食油市塲交易昨停頓，日來各物搶購之風雖轉鬆懈，惟食油門市奇暢，首批配油已於昨日配發零售商，以濟市需，惟太市食油存量異常充沛，市民此種不健全之心理，大可免除。</p>
<h3>茶市外銷樂觀</h3>
<p>查紅綠茶花色，自產存兩枯後，供應久未寬暢，而昨日市上，又受秋雨影響，賣戶幾完全隱匿，各方胃納濃郁，惟交易缺乏實際，形勢均少波重，一致堅檔盤旋。</p>
<p>茲據業中人談稱：目前本市若干家貿易公司，鑒於出口物資，前途樂觀，故均在增關出口部，尤以茶葉，因海外需求奇殷，創設者更若雨後春笋，並謀捷足先得起見已向同業索取茶樣。</p>
<h3>食糖微軟</h3>
<p>糖市昨日自由交易仍極冷落，但人心已見稍軟，綠合糖公司接受社局委託，卽將標售秘魯砂糖一萬五千包，業內游資已有出路，一部份缺單者，脫意似見濃厚，而本街納胃微見淸稀，去化不旺，二十二期砂白四五號車白精，塲上無供，未見做開。粗砂中砂依限略有成交，其餘市况平庸。</p>
<h3>浙省絲產漸次增加</h3>
<p>浙江氣候土壤最宜蠶桑，戰前全省七十六縣市中產蠶絲者，達五十八縣。以種桑養蠶為人民主要副業者，不下廿餘縣。蠶農凡一百餘萬戶，栽桑面積兩百六十餘萬畝，蠶業鼎盛時，年產鮮兩九十萬擔，廠絲三萬擔，土絲五萬擔，綢緞二百萬疋，佔全國總產量三分之一。民國十七年以前，我國出口商品以絲佔第一位，而浙江輸出生絲，則佔全國生絲出口額百分之卅以上，其產量之豐，可以想見。</p>
<p>桑樹之裁培，以臨水為宜，故浙江蠶絲之分佈，均集中於襟江帶河之水鄉。最繁盛之蠶區，約可分為錢塘江，曹娥江及太湖附近等三區。各區主要燃份及產量如下：</p>
<p>年產鮮兩15－20萬擔為吳與·嘉與·杭縣·等三縣，10－15萬擔為蕭山·海寗·兩縣，5－10萬擔，為桐鄉`諸曁`擊縣三縣，1－5萬擔為長興·德淸·海鹽·餘杭·平湖·祟德·臨安·新昌等八縣。</p>
<p>就中吳興嘉興杭縣蕭山海寗五縣所產佔全省產額百分之七十左右，故浙江蠶桑重心，係在錢江北·太湖南·舊杭嘉湖府屬各地。</p>
<p>各縣產繭，出路有二：（一）為銷售新式絲廠繅製廠絲，（二）為農民利用土法，自行繅成土絲。在廠絲未發達以前，浙江所產以土絲爲多，全盛時期，年產廠絲三萬担，土絲五萬担。浙江生絲大部為當地織綢之用，輸出年約二萬餘担，以銷歐美為大宗，南洋等地次之。</p>
<p>戰時浙江蠶區，各縣莫不遭受敵偽摧殘，桑園多數荒廢，絲廠繭行什九均成廢墟，製種塲倖存無幾。綜計蠶絲方面，損失如以戰前幣值計算，至少在五千萬元以上。勝利後政府亟謀復與，蠶絲事業已略有起色。據統計卅五年全省共有蠶戶四十七萬四千九百三十六戶，桑園九九五，二一一畝，生產鮮繭一七五，一三一担，約達戰前產量五分之一。</p>
<p>卅六年度，經省蠶絲管理改進機關，竭力推廣，分區輔導各地蠶農，共圖蠶桑之繁殖與增產。春秋兩期，產量均有增加，惟詳確數字，尚待查報。茲根據蠢種及飼育收成，估計春秋兩期鮮繭產量，計春期飼育改良蠶種五一一，二八七張，圭蠶種三〇〇，〇〇〇張，每張平均收成鮮　二〇斤，共產鮮繭一六二，二五七担（此數與各收購鮮　廠商，收起春期鮮繭總數九四四六四祖，參閱尚為接近，定徵與實際產量出入無多），秋期飼育，改良蠶種三〇〇，〇〇〇張，土種無。因收成較春期略差，每張僅獲鮮　十五——二〇斤，共約產鮮　五〇，〇〇〇担，全年計約達廿一萬二千餘担，比卅五年產量增進百分之廿五。</p>

<p>按浦東為丙二部牛耳，平日訓練認眞，球藝猛進，尤以左手小將周稼南，精攻善抽，為老將陳霖笙之得意萬足，大有靑出於藍之槪。他如張季良韓大輪亦屬抽手中之佼佼。但凌雲在胡建坤領導下，三員小將異常饒勇，奪得丙一部亞席，强如綠營綠，影聯黑，綢靑等隊，亦均屈服於板下。此役勝者卽有染指丙組冠軍之希望，敗者僅能能爭取季軍一席。屆時凌雲必須臨陣鎭定，以柔克剛，否則恐難挫浦東銳氣正盛之鋒芒，茲探錄雙方名單如下：</p>
<p>（浦東）韓熙麟（領隊），張季良，周稼南，韓大輪，蔡秀章</p>
<p>（凌雲）胡建坤（領隊），王維榮，胡仰樞，朱介相，陸春林</p>
<p>又前晚（十二日）原為乙組猶太對綠營作亞軍決賽，因是日適為猶太一年一度之祈禱怖，停止一切娛樂遊宴，由主辦當局特准改期於下週一（十八日）舉行，故雙方均未出席。</p>

<h3>醉漢墜車</h3>
<p>— 吳庸</p>
<p>莊十達生篇：「夫醉者之墜車，雖疾不死。骨節與人同，而犯害與人異，其神全也，業亦不知也，緊亦不知也；死生驚懼不入乎其胸中，是故遷物而不　。彼得全於酒而猶若是，而况得全於天乎？」這是說：一人喝醉了酒，「死生驚懼不入乎其胸中」，故雖自疾行的車上墜下，亦不致死亡。</p>
<p>醉漢自扶梯墜下而竟酣然入睡的事，我們是聽到過的，可是究竟未曾予以科學化的實驗，其眞確性如何，不得而知。在歷史上我們也不曾讀到過莊子本人曾喝醉了酒隊軍「屢試不爽」的記載。只是如果把「其神全也」句解作「臨陣不懼」，「處之若定」，精神不為外物所分散，或將「得全於天」句的「天」字解作「天眞」的「天」，則此項二千年前的「醉漢墜軍不死」說在二千年後，於遠在數千里外的紐約，我們已找到了例證。</p>
<p>原來在紐約市有一個年才二歲名呌戡納斯·李勃門的小孩子從六層高樓的窗口，一不小心落了下來，跌在一方草地上，可是隨卽站了起來，竟自搖搖擺擺的走掉，絲毫夫曾受傷·我們總還記得年前一架飛機在滬市郊失事墜下，飛械與乘客俱毀，而一名小孩子獨安然無恙。其所以不死者，當是不慌不忙，「死生驚懼不入乎其胸中」之故。這兩個孩子如於三十年後逢到了同樣的遭遇，其結果將是怎樣呢？那時他們目然世故已深，經驗豐富，必然神色緊張，驚怖萬狀，落在地上時，其不如一隻碗之四分五裂者幾希。有哈耳·鮑育者，有感於此，乃作如下的議論：</p>
<p>依法律規定，孩子們必須入學，向成人們學習·可是法律並無明文規定成人們必須向孩子學習。而事實上孩子們的言行頓有足以供成人效法之處。孩子長大成人之後，很少仍能保持這種不慌不忙的精神。運動界的選手大都仍能保持這種精神。他們之所以能成其為選手者，也只是為了這個綠故。他們於比賽之際常能不慌不忙，若無其事，故能應付對手時得心應手，游刃有餘。一人如與對手作戰之時同時尚須與自身作戰，其獲勝的機會是很少的。一人心神疑懼不安時卽是在對自身作戰。</p>
<p>人們卽使富有了一切，到了實在無須再事憂慮的地步，然仍難免憂慮如故。此時他們所憂慮的都是恐怕所有財富之得而復失。據說美國人之死於神經緊張者遠多於死於別的原因的人。而許多人的飲食過度，只是一種心神不寗的表示。按這末一句話與我國「借酒澆愁」一語有近似處。</p>
<p>此論主旨是呌人不要神經緊張，以致遇事疑懼不安。觀乎近日全國各地人舞之搶購物資，其情緒之恐慌緊張，得朱曾有，平心靜氣說一句，實不無過份過火之處。大家這樣担心着，受害的還是老百姓自已。須知越是看重自己私利的人越會得不到私利。聖經：「不看重自己生命的必將獲得生命」一語，實有深意。</p>
<p>我國有一句古語呌做：後之視今，亦猶今之視昔。此語固不錯，然卡納其有一句涵義較為樂觀的話，他說：今日之愁明日，亦猶昨日之愁今日。蓋謂人之所憂慮者往往不會見於事實也。故今日一般人的盲目地跟踪着人，見他人慌張，我亦效尤慌張，實亦有點儀盲人之騎瞎馬。與其如此，確不如效「醉漢墜車」之為愈。</p>
<h3>天放樓</h3>
<p>— 錢大成</p>
<p>陽湖趙烈文晚年流寓處山，築有「天放樓」，藏書數萬卷。丁丑之亂，其家人盡以易米，時余偕友人曹菊生在故里設有「澤古書舖」，因亦收得數種。若錢泰吉手校「班馬字類」則已售去。菊生尚存有烈文手批嘉靖刊本薛蕙所撰「老子集解」。趙氏藏書皆有「天放樓」大藏印，曁累累數十字之長方藏印，且每冊鈐之，烈文並以朱筆標明冊數，卽通行本書籍亦如此，不獨善本為然也。</p>
<p>烈文字惠甫，號能靜居士，在曾國藩國荃兄弟幕府甚一久。其所著「能靜居日記」五十四冊，（陳乃乾先生輯趙氏年譜稱有六十四冊，實誤記。余今春晤烈文孫婿王紀玉姨丈，謂僅有五十四冊。姨丈精於目錄板本之學，藏書亦精好。今任中央圖書館編纂，所語當確實。）其中頗多太平天國掌故。烈文且嘗共忠王李秀成長談，對秀成頗有同情之感，而對淸軍攻入南京後之暴行，頗為憤慨，且一再諫請曾國基收拾人心，曾不之聽，烈文因卽憤而他適。對國藩則敬事彌誠篤，國藩亦稱烈交所作詩為才人之第。迨國藩歿，卽引疼南歸。在常熟西城購地築「靜圃」，廣且數十畝，有樓五楹，卽所謂「天放樓」也。日夕共虞山友人若楊濠叟趙次侯曾君表聚以文酒自遣。卒於光緒癸已，年六十二。烈文亦深通金石之學，所藏金石拓本皆有手跋，今亦散佚已盡。靜圃且為武進盛氏購以贈天章寺僧治開，改作「寗靜運社」。今此園風景大改，惟「天放樓」則嶺然猶存，但已化為念佛堂矣。</p>
<p>陳乃乾先生與趙氏有舊，曾借讀「能靜居日記」旬日，鉤玄提要，為輯一年譜。據王紀玉先生云二日記中載遜淸堂故至夥。嘗記翁文恭相國以同治帝不悅學，對之痛哭；帝乃以論語「君子一不器」一句，將「器」字掩沒下一半，以示文恭。亦足以見帝之頗有小慧。類是者甚衆。惜日記稿本亦為其後人斥售，今不知流轉何所？茍有好事者為之印行，則足與「越縵堂日記」相頡頏，而為淸季堂故之淵藪也。</p>
<p>近人金松岑先生亦以「天放樓」名其書齋。松岑先生亦嘗慨然有用世之志。兩人同以書生老，未嘗遂其所志；有材無位，是亦世運使然邪？</p>
<h3>藝樓雜詩</h3>
<p>— 施叔範</p>
<p>夜游吳淞</p>
<p>子夜避喧意已微，共魚吞　忘歸，螢穿白　　凉　氣，潮淹黃星破靜機，大海不隨兵刦變，頽關誰惜箸謀非？野人無位此荒坐，味景看天露滿衣。</p>
<p>日幕觀巷外車夫　集啖餅輒為網然</p>
<p>向晚風寒樹影斜，沿街麥餅下淸茶，破衣料不徵棉稅，焦土今猶豔火花。坐看靑黃自換歲，微聞十九已無家，江南一飽彌天幸，忍想關東猶草芽！</p>
<p>重九</p>
<p>木落靈旗渺渺過，靑齊一髪接灤河，登高望遠秋無際，飲酒為歡地不多，黃菊可知哀郢賦，白衣莫唱渡江歌！明年人少蒿萊盛，待到重陽又若何？</p>
<h3>食無蛋</h3>
<p>— 渡雲</p>
<p>有人觀起英國人節約，每人在一星期中只吃一隻鷄蛋，殊不知在上海，鷄蛋已無買處，　　　　　　　　要絕跡了。</p>
<p>據蛋業中人說，他們是竭誠擁護八一九限價的，願意照限價賣出，可是八一九後，却有人節節抬價，向產區搜購，每只到申淨本，已由五分漲至一角，尚有績漲之勢。以一角成本，而六分賣出，無利可岡，反要虧本，誰願幹此賣買？</p>
<p>某君往揚州採辦鷄蛋，只見揚州蛋行，白天停業，夥友睡覺，深夜開始營業。緣自八一九以還，當地鷄蛋限價每百斤三十四元，但因有冰蛋廠及土蛋廠在該地設莊抬價搜購鷄蛋，每百斤毛蛋六十二元，外點二斤，臉此計算，實超過限價一倍以上。若在白天收貨，便有一批制服單帮，向行家照限價收購，若不批給，便有囤積居奇之罪，若批給他，要虧本一半，因此只好關照收蛋販子，在半夜裏偷偷地送蛋到行。於是弄得大家白天睡覺，晚間實行黑市。當然，從此以後，上海人再也吃不羨鷄蛋了。</p>
<h3>談紙</h3>
<p>— 則仕</p>
<p>中國人有句老話：「開門七件事，柴米油鹽　　茶。」現在是現在了，開門七件事也許已增至七十件或减至三件半，好像已沒有什麼一定可言，至少烟已是今日開門若干件事之一，而昔日是沒有的。</p>
<p>不知道開門七件之事是否卽等於今之所謂日用物品？若然，則今日為「開門六件事，米麺油布與紗紙」了。當局如此說，報上如此載。</p>
<p>細思之覺得殊不妥當。日用物品中何以無柴或煤球，何以有紙張－白報紙與毛邊紙？「試執途人而問之」，一天不用柴火的人是沒有的，一年不買白報紙甚至毛邊紙的人一定「滔滔者天下皆是也」。何以日用之物不列入日用之物，年不一用之物列入日用之物？</p>
<p>是不是你我天天看報，故報紙遂成日用物品？姑不論上海四五百萬人口，最暢銷的報紙也不過自稱日銷十五萬，卽使人手一份吧，報紙要列入日用品也得提携提携油墨，以及我們的文章－我錯了，文章原已無形列入「日用品」－不漲稿費。</p>
<p>寫到這裏，閱報又悉社會局已根據紙商請求，對購紙決定（一）凡是有配額的如各書店等，絕不能再到紙店買紙，（二）外埠不能到上海買紙，（三）個人最多買五令。請問如我正想印書而無配額，怎麼辦？又：個人倒有五令可買，個人是無白報紙用處的，准買五令，豈不是鼓勵黃牛，提倡囤紙？</p>
<p>怪哉，怪哉！</p>
<p>###</p>
<p>換金子，換金子，一換再換，千人萬人，忽然現出一顆「斗大黃金印」來！卽今閧傳遐邇之淸豫親王後裔，向北平中央銀行請兌金圓券之寶物也。</p>
<p>平素所見印信，大都銅質居多，銀者已罕覩，金者更僅聞其名。帝制時代皇帝之印有「寶」有「　」，其質有「金」有「王」；親王之印日「寶」，其質為「金」；一二品大臣之印日「印」，其質為「銀」；三品惟順天府是銀印，其他京外各官三品以下昔銅印；佐雜小官則有銅有木。統計以銅為最多而普，金者銀者比較少數。但合計京都各部院，各旗，外省之督撫·藩司·提督·總兵·將軍·都統等，銀印數量，亦自可觀，惟金者限於　室及祟對，故最賣亦最少。　親王者，淸初人關勳爵之一，世襲三百年，此印可稱古物。其王府在東城，規模宏大，民初早已售與西人，後嗣式微，今又傳家老寳出手，當年貴　，末路王孫，世事滄桑，大都如此。印是三寸六分見方，毛重二百七十兩，到銀行後，剪斷驗看，得純金二百餘兩，可換金園劵約五萬，為數不少，售者可資溫飽，央行所兌亦比較為大宗，是一快事。忽被故宮博物院所聞，謂此乃有歷史價值之寶物，要移院保存，自有一理，但售主目的在換現錢度日，而收兌之銀行以收兌買金為職務，那管寶不寳。各方立塲不同，觀念自異，亦一有趣之岔曲。</p>
<p>「印」是通稱。除帝王之「寶」「　」外，京外各衙門，正方者謂之「印」，在內部院各　，在外藩臬兩司，運使，及淸末添設之提學等使，以至知府·知州·知縣·府經·巡檢等職·皆為正方形，而以品級分大小。一品印約三寸三（每邊），二品約三寸，三品二寸七八，四品者二寸五，五六七八九品，以次遞减數分，至巡檢九品小印，則小如蘇式「五香豆腐乾」矣。然鑄字精巧，故可玩也。此所謂尺寸係官尺，比舊市尺只八折，故此豫親王印（原文「和碩豫親王寶」六字），名為三寸六分見方，實只「二寸八分八厘」，予所得知府印（四品），名為二寸五見方，實尺二寸也。</p>
<p>長方形者，名目甚多。總督，巡撫，學政所用，其文日「關防」。（因督撫是以兵部及都察院官出而監臨地方，其堂印在京城為合衙公用，不能帶之出京，故另頒「關防」，明代謂之「半印」。學院亦是京員外放，故亦只有「關防」，無印。）次則道台，乃兩司之佐貳，明代各道均帶布政司參政參議原街銜，或按察司副使僉事銜，其印在省城，亦不能隨身，故亦用「關防」，如昔之上海道官雖大，卻無印，上海縣官雖小，却有方印。再次則同知通判，為知府佐貳，知府衙門有府印，同知通判則用「關防」。縣區之佐雜官，則木的銅的方的長方的都有，如典史只用木刻「鈴記」（長方形），俗名「木頭戳子」，在省城官匠製造（銅質各印及關防不淪大小皆由京城禮部鑄發）。淸末各省新設局所及學堂甚多，大半以道府領之，雖是四品大官，用「關防」，但非實缺，亦是「木頭戳子」，够不上領中央的印。</p>
<p>前淸之銀印，合二十餘省之一二品官計之，眞不在少數。卽以江蘇一省而言，一總督，一巡撫，兩布政司，一漕督（後改江北提督），還有些將軍都統副都統，水陸提督，及各鎭總兵，已不下二十餘顆。每顆平均計銀二百兩，全國約四五百顆·辛亥革命，多挾印遠匿，或流亡散失，不知流落何方矣。</p>

<h3>Great Victory of National Army in Eastern Guanzhong: Land and Air Forces Display Power North of Dali, Bandit Army Collapses and Suffers 20,000 Casualties</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Xi'an, 13th] The fierce battle of annihilation in central Guanzhong is still ongoing. The bandits near Da Hao Ying, Dongxi Hancun, and Yanzhi Mountain, north of Dali, have collapsed after being fiercely attacked by concentrated firepower from the National Army. According to military announcements, the bandit army has suffered over 20,000 casualties, with over 12,000 bodies left on the battlefield. Other battle results are also very abundant. The remaining bandits are fleeing towards Jilizhen, northeast of Dali. Another unit of the National Army captured over 600 bandit soldiers alive at Bianzhangying, northeast of Dali.</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Xi'an, 13th] The Air Force from the Xi'an base destroyed a large quantity of materials and over 300 horse-drawn carts accumulated by the bandits on the bank of the Yumenkou River on the 13th. It also fiercely attacked the defeated bandits fleeing northeast on the highway between Tihu Town and Heyang, killing or wounding over 2,000 bandit soldiers. On the afternoon of the same day, the Air Force, in coordination with the ground National Army, captured Beidangjun, southeast of Yongfeng. The bandits fled northeast. As of the time of this reporter's dispatch, although the moon was high and the night was deep, the rumbling of aircraft engines could still be heard.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Xi'an, 13th] The bandit army's front line north of Dali has completely collapsed. A remnant of the bandits has begun to flee in panic from the northeast of Dali. The rearguard unit of the bandits at Dongxi Licun, northeast of Da Hao Ying, was surrounded by our forces on the afternoon of the 13th and completely annihilated. (Another dispatch) The bandit Second Column, which was trapped near Da Hao Ying by the powerful forces of Shi Yi, fought a bloody battle all day. Around 6:00 PM on the 12th, the entire 7,000+ men of the 359th Brigade and the Independent 4th Brigade of this bandit Second Column were completely annihilated by us, except for a small number who were captured alive, after they were unable to escape despite repeated attempts to break through in all directions.</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Xi'an, 13th] The National Army on the border of Shaanxi and Henan has retreated from Xiping and Jingziguan to Fushuiguan, east of Shangnan.</p>
<p>And Suburban Bloody Battles Intensify: National Army Transfers from Wusu Airport</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Xi'an, 13th] Fierce bloody battles are raging in the suburbs of Taiyuan. The bandits in the east are constantly firing artillery into the city, causing fires in places such as Gulou (Drum Tower) and Kaihua Temple. Two bandit columns entrenched near Yuci have also moved north to join the attack on the outskirts of Taiyuan.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Taiyuan, 13th] The bloody battles in the suburbs of Taiyuan are intensifying. On the evening of the 12th, the bandits used all their strength to continue attacking strongholds 30 li south of the city at Wusu Airport, 25 li southeast of the city at Shizuizi, and 30 li northeast of the city at Fengge Liang. The intensity of the fighting was unprecedented since the bandits' invasion of Taiyuan. The bandits also used poison gas bombs at Fengge Liang. The bandits attacking Wusu regrouped over 5,000 remnants on the morning of the 12th, and under the cover of artillery fire, launched continuous fierce attacks on our positions. By 2:00 PM, the bandits had suffered heavy casualties and their offensive had been thwarted. In the evening, the bandit army again used all its strength to launch a fierce attack. The defending troops fought bravely in a bloody battle until dawn on the 13th. Piles of bandit corpses lay like mountains. The defending troops, having accomplished their mission of annihilating the bandits, proactively shifted their positions to continue annihilating the bandits. On the Fengge Liang front, the National Army launched a counterattack, destroying many bandit fortifications. The bandits suffered heavy losses and resorted to their usual despicable tactics, releasing poison gas bombs against the National Army on the 12th. In the evening, they regrouped their remnants and launched a fierce attack on our positions. The defending troops fought bravely to meet the attack, and the fierce battle continued throughout the night. As of dawn on the 13th, the National Army still held several important bunkers and continued to fight the bandits. In total, over 3,000 bandits were killed or wounded in various battles.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Taiyuan, 13th] Amidst the fierce fighting in the suburbs of Taiyuan, the personnel of the China Central Airlines stationed in Taiyuan left Taiyuan for Ping after the Civil Aviation Transportation Team on the afternoon of the 13th. Therefore, the civil aviation organization stationed in Taiyuan has completely withdrawn. However, the Ping-Taiyuan route is still flying as usual. According to reports, this is the second withdrawal of the civil aviation organization since the defense of Taiyuan began. The first was on July 19th.</p>
<h3>Developments in the Battle on the Ping-Sui Railway: Entire Route from Nankou to Kangzhuang Cleared; Qingshuihe County Town Recovered in Southern Sui</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Beiping, 13th] The Suppression Headquarters issued a report: (1) Major developments have been seen in the eastern section of the Ping-Sui Railway battle. The bandits who had infiltrated north of Dongyuan and south of Qinglongqiao were attacked by the National Army in successive waves on the night of the 12th and began to collapse into the northeastern mountainous area on the 13th. At the same time, the bandits who infiltrated Changping Station retreated to the mountains. The railway between Changping and Nankou, which had been damaged, was repaired at 10:00 AM on the 13th, and telephone communication to Dongyuan was restored. The troops advancing south from Zhangjiakou swept away the bandits along the line of Shacheng, Tumu, Huailai, Kangzhuang, and Xibazi from the night of the 12th to the afternoon of the 13th, and have advanced to the area north of Qinglongqiao. There were sporadic battles between Sanbao and Qinglongqiao on the morning of the 13th. Currently, the southward advancing troops are expanding on both sides of the railway and actively carrying out suppression operations.

<h3>Measures for Requesting and Paying Foreign Exchange: Ministry of Finance Plans to Revise Draft; Monetary Department Invites Relevant Units to Exchange Opinions</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Nanjing, 13th] After the currency system reform, the methods related to foreign exchange review, application for purchase, and payment will be revised. The Executive Yuan has designated the Ministry of Finance to invite relevant units to discuss the integration and drafting of these new methods. At around 10:00 AM on the 13th, the Monetary Department of the Ministry of Finance specially convened a meeting with representatives from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Ministry of Education, the Import and Export Control Committee, the Central Bank, and the Executive Yuan. Present were Director-General Mai Shijun of the General Affairs Department of the Ministry of Education, Director-General Chen Yingjing of the General Affairs Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and Section Chief Zhu Jingyi of the Executive Yuan, among others. The meeting was presided over by Director of the Monetary Department Bu Fuzhou. During the discussion, the Ministry of Finance presented a draft of the "Measures for Applying for Purchase and Payment of Foreign Exchange," which served as the basis for discussion. After exchanging opinions, it was agreed that the measures should be re-drafted. It was also decided that the relevant units should first submit written opinions to the Ministry of Finance for collation, and then present them for discussion at the next meeting. The main points of the draft measures proposed by the Ministry of Finance are as follows: (1) Applications for purchasing or paying foreign currency or foreign exchange deposits should be submitted on an application form stating the nature of the need. (2) If an agency imports goods, it must obtain an import permit from the Import and Export Control Committee of the Executive Yuan. (3) State-owned enterprises and importers shall apply to the Import and Export Control Committee for import permits. (4) If an exporter needs to pay freight, insurance, and commissions in foreign exchange, he shall submit a certificate of settlement with a designated bank and apply to the designated bank for the foreign exchange required. (5) Students studying abroad at their own expense may apply to the Central Bank for living expenses, with a maximum of US$150 per person per month, and a maximum of US$900 in one purchase. Foreign exchange for medical expenses may be applied for in case of illness. Return travel expenses shall not exceed US$400. (6) Those engaged in business abroad may apply to the Central Bank for travel expenses to go abroad, up to a maximum of US$400.

(8) If the salaries of personnel from foreign institutions and troops stationed in China are exchanged into gold yuan coupons by the local Central Bank and distributed, the remaining amount may be collected by the original organization before the 15th of the following month and applied to the original exchange bank for the purchase of foreign exchange to be remitted back to their home country, but not exceeding 50% of the total amount.

Those traveling abroad with passports may simultaneously apply for US$100 for travel use within the approved purchase or payment deposit total.

<h3>Next Year's General Budget Plan: Executive Yuan Passes Compilation and Review Methods; To Be Sent to the Legislative Yuan for Review Before the End of November</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Nanjing, 13th] The compilation and review methods for the central government's general budget for the 38th year were drafted by the Directorate-General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics and passed by the Executive Yuan on the 13th. They will be distributed to the various agencies for compilation within the prescribed time limit. According to the Constitution, the central government's general budget should be submitted to the Legislative Yuan for review three months before the beginning of the fiscal year. However, because the budget for the 37th year was compiled in two parts, for the first and second halves of the year, and the second half of the year coincided with the currency system reform, the time was delayed. The compilation and review of the budget for the 38th year has also been delayed. It is reported that the general budget compilation and review methods passed by the Executive Yuan on the 13th still stipulate the separate compilation of general and special budgets, and detailed deadlines are set for the compilation and review of budgets at all levels. The methods stipulate that the primary and secondary competent authorities should formulate policy plans based on the policy guidelines passed by the Executive Yuan at its previous meeting and compile rough estimates. The revenue budget should be sent to the Ministry of Finance, and the expenditure budget should be sent to the Directorate-General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics, all to be submitted before October 31st of this year. The state-owned enterprises (state-owned financial, transportation, public utility, trade, industrial, and mining enterprises) under the secondary competent authorities shall separately compile business plans and business rough estimates and submit them to the Directorate-General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics before October 31st. The number of official interest and dividends that can be settled for each business full year is compiled into a revenue rough estimate and submitted to the Ministry of Finance at the same time. The Ministry of Finance, upon receiving the revenue rough estimates from the various agencies, shall compile a revenue general rough estimate and submit it to the Directorate-General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics before November 5th. The Directorate-General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics, based on the expenditure rough estimates from the various agencies and the revenue general rough estimate compiled by the Ministry of Finance, shall review them and compile the general budget proposal and special budget proposal and submit them to the Executive Yuan before November 20th. After discussion and approval by the Executive Yuan, they shall be submitted to the Legislative Yuan for review together with the policy guidelines and policy plans before November 30th. The compilation and review methods also contain detailed regulations regarding the preparation of the budget. The important ones are: (1) Except for those that are tightened or expanded in accordance with the policy plan, the recurring expenses of each agency shall be based on the sum of the original budget for the second half of the 37th year and its increased part. Salaries and public funds shall be calculated separately based on the number of approved personnel and the prescribed standards for the second half of the 37th year. (2) The temporary expenses of each agency shall be assessed and listed based on actual needs. Unnecessary expenditures shall not be included. (3) The operating expenses of each agency shall be compiled in accordance with the approved plan. Projects that cannot be effective in the short term shall be postponed. Those that can be attributed to the local government shall be transferred to the local government for handling. (4) The first reserve fund shall be listed at 5% of the total recurring expenses. (5) The foreign currency, Taiwan currency, and Hong Kong currency required by each agency shall be clearly stated and compiled in accordance with the statutory ratio of the gold yuan coupon. (6) Before the revision of the fiscal revenue and expenditure system for provincial and municipal subsidies, except for special circumstances where the central government may provide appropriate subsidies, those that have continuity in the amounts listed in the general budget for the 37th year shall be extended and compiled.</p>
<h3>Legislative Yuan's Budget, Finance Committees Discuss Improving Public Education Treatment: Committee Members, Proposers to Research, Draft Specific Measures</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Nanjing, 13th] The Legislative Yuan's Budget and Finance Committees held a joint meeting on the morning of the 13th to review the proposals related to improving the treatment of public education personnel by Jin Shaoxian et al., Yu Lingyun et al., and Xie Chengyu et al. It was decided that each committee should appoint five members to conduct detailed research with the original proposers, draft specific measures, and then submit them to the joint meeting for discussion. The committee members had no objection to the principle of reforming the treatment of public education personnel. However, some believed that adjusting the treatment of public education personnel at the present time would further stimulate the market and affect the effectiveness of economic management. Others advocated that after deciding on the principle of improvement, the Executive Yuan should research and draft measures and consult the Legislative Yuan for review. Regarding the issue of financial resources, the majority of the committee members believed that if the government effectively implemented the budget, the expenditure for improving the treatment of public education personnel would not necessarily require increasing currency issuance. Measures such as canceling grain rations in the six major cities, selling enemy-puppet and traitorous property, using US aid materials, levying temporary property taxes, liquidating the capital of wealthy families, postponing debt repayment, and controlling the profits of state-owned enterprises should be actively promoted to broaden the state treasury income, save unnecessary expenses, and use it to improve the treatment of public education personnel.</p>
<h3>Sale of Enemy-Puppet Real Estate: Strive for Fair Valuation</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Nanjing, 13th] The Economic and Resources Committee of the Legislative Yuan met in the afternoon of the 13th to hear the report of He Haoruo, chairman of the Executive Yuan's Enemy-Puppet Property Handling Committee. He explained five points: (1) Enemy-puppet real estate will be sold at a variable price. If the original occupants do not prepare funds to purchase the property within fifteen days, it will be publicly auctioned. Garden villas inhabited by high-ranking officials and wealthy people will not be let off easily. However, for alley houses inhabited by general public education personnel, their economic capabilities will be considered. If they cannot prepare the price themselves, efforts will still be made to maintain their priority rental rights. (2) Real estate used by government agencies and state-owned enterprises as offices, dormitories, or factories may be transferred. (3) The property of traitors will be dealt with after their crimes have been finally adjudicated. The residences of Mayor Wu of Shanghai and Bei Zuyi are all traitorous properties that have not yet been finally adjudicated. (4) The reason why the property of German僑民 has not been dealt with is that a question of direct warfare and indirect warfare once arose in the previous conference on German reparations. China has not suffered direct damage from Germany. If we directly confiscate the property of its nationals, it may cause international criticism. (5) The total income from enemy-puppet property that has been processed in the past is 931.48 billion Legal Tender, of which about one-twentieth, or 459.6 billion Legal Tender, was transferred for relief. This figure cannot be converted into gold yuan because the time of income varies. The estimated future income is about 33.274 million gold yuan.</p>
<h3>National Defense Ministry Organizational Law: Joint Review Underway</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Nanjing, 13th] The National Defense Committee of the Legislative Yuan held a closed meeting on the morning of the 13th to continue discussing the National Defense Ministry Organizational Law. It was decided to appoint Yu Zheng, Yan Xunfu, Wang Jun, Jiang Gongliang, Chen Jiesheng, Wang Demin, Xue Jinyu and other seven members to consult the opinions expressed by the various members and jointly conduct a review with the members selected by the Legislative Committee.</p>
<h3>Monthly Salary and Public Expense Payment Methods for the President, Vice President, and Appointed and Special Appointed Personnel: The Examination Yuan Drafts a Proposal to Report to the Legislative Yuan Tomorrow</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Nanjing, 13th] The monthly salary and public expense payment methods for the President, Vice President, and appointed and specially appointed personnel have been drafted into draft regulations by the Examination Yuan after detailed research and consultation with the Executive Yuan. They are proposed to be submitted to the Legislative Yuan for review and have been included in the reporting matters section of the 11th meeting of the second session of the Legislative Yuan on the 15th. The draft regulations have a total of five articles. According to the monthly salary and public expense figures set in them, the President can earn 1724 gold yuan coupons per month, the Vice President 924 yuan, the heads of the Executive, Judicial, and Examination Yuans 444 yuan, the vice heads 364 yuan, and the heads of the ministries and commissions appointed by other special appointments and the secretaries-general of the Legislative and Supervisory Yuans and the Director of the Information Bureau 284 yuan. The full text of the provisional regulations on the monthly salary and public expense payment for the President and appointed and specially appointed officials is recorded below: Article 1: The monthly salary and public expenses of the President shall each be set at 8,000 yuan. The monthly salary and public expenses of the Vice President shall each be set at 4,000 yuan (Explanation: There are currently no regulations on the monthly salary of the President and Vice President. The annual salary of the US President is 75,000 yuan, and the annual salary of the Vice President and Secretary of State is 15,000 yuan, one-fifth of the President's annual salary. The various situations in our country are different. It is now proposed that the monthly salary of appointed and specially appointed personnel be 800 yuan, so the President's monthly salary is proposed to be listed at ten times 800 yuan, and the Vice President's monthly salary is proposed to be halved according to the President's monthly salary. As for the public expenses, the President's provisional list for July was 200 million yuan, and the Vice President's provisional list was 100 million yuan, which is far from the actual needs, so it is also proposed to list it according to the amount of the monthly salary).</p>
<p>Article 2: The monthly salary of appointed personnel is set at 800 yuan, the public expenses of the heads of the Executive Yuan, Judicial Yuan, and Examination Yuan are set at 2,400 yuan, the public expenses of the vice heads of the Judicial Yuan and Examination Yuan are set at 1,600 yuan, and the public expenses of other appointed personnel are set at 800 yuan (Explanation: The responsibilities of appointed and specially appointed personnel are originally different, but they are all political officials. Setting tiered regulations will hinder rather than help, so the monthly salary of elected and specially appointed officials set by the National Government during the period of political tutelage is uniformly set at 800 yuan. However, the public expenses are 800 yuan for general appointed and specially appointed personnel, doubled for the vice heads, and doubled again for the heads).</p>
<p>Article 3: The monthly salary and public expenses of specially appointed personnel are each set at 800 yuan, and the public expenses of the Vice President of the Executive Yuan are set at 1,600 yuan.</p>
<p>The monthly salary and public expenses of personnel specially appointed by the organizational law are determined by reference to the regulations for specially appointed personnel (Explanation: The current organizational law has secretaries-general of the Legislative and Supervisory Yuans, the Director of the Information Bureau of the Executive Yuan, etc. In the future, there may be more as needed, but it is limited to those specified by the organizational law to avoid abuse).</p>
<p>Article 4: The monthly salary and public expenses stipulated in this regulation shall be paid in gold yuan according to the current standard of discounting the salaries of civil servants (Explanation: Before the promulgation of the new salary system, the salaries of civil servants are still based on Legal Tender for calculation, so the figures stipulated in this regulation are still based on the old system. The current standard for civil servants to discount the salary of gold yuan is that each yuan within 40 yuan is actually issued in gold yuan, 20% is discounted for 41 yuan to 300 yuan, and 10% is discounted for 301 yuan and above. The monthly salary and public expenses stipulated in this regulation are of course appropriate. If there is any change in the future discounting standard, it will be handled accordingly).</p>
<p>Article 5: This regulation shall be implemented from the date of promulgation.</p>
<h3>Henan Provincial Assembly Cables to the Central Government: Ensure Bian-Zheng, Stabilize the Central Plains</h3>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Trends in the Japanese Political Situation</h3>
<p>The special session of the Japanese Diet convened on the 11th of this month. This special session faces the resignation en masse of the Ashida Cabinet, and its main task is to elect a new prime minister and revise the "National Public Service Law." According to Article 67 of the Japanese Constitution, the Prime Minister is designated by the Diet from among its members. According to custom, the candidates for Prime Minister must first be consulted outside the Diet, and then proposed by the majority party to avoid fluctuations in the Diet. After the Ashida Cabinet announced its resignation en masse on the 7th, the Speaker of the House of Representatives, Komakichi Matsuoka, visited Shigeru Yoshida, President of the Democratic Liberal Party, on the 8th to inquire about his views on forming a new cabinet. He also visited the leaders of the Socialist Party, the National Cooperative Party, the Democratic Party, and the Socialist Reform Party to promote a five-party leaders' meeting to exchange views on the formation of a coalition government. The Democratic Liberal Party initially adopted a rejecting attitude towards the five-party leaders' meeting, but later agreed to hold it in Speaker Matsuoka's office in the House of Representatives on the morning of the 10th. Judging from the general situation, there is little doubt that Shigeru Yoshida, President of the Democratic Liberal Party, will come forward to lead the formation of a cabinet. The problem currently facing him is whether to form a coalition government or a one-party government. This question concerning the form of government is of great importance to the future political trends in Japan and deserves our deep attention.</p>
<p>The collapse of the Ashida Cabinet was an inevitable fact. Seven months ago, when Ashida appeared in the guise of a "new opening of an old shop" of the previous Katayama Cabinet, this newspaper predicted in its editorial that the Ashida Cabinet would still be a short-lived cabinet, paving the way for Shigeru Yoshida. Since Takeo Kurisu, the Minister of Economic Stabilization in the previous Katayama Cabinet and then in the Ashida Cabinet, was detained in September due to a corruption case, the cabinet has faced a major crisis. This newspaper pointed out in its editorial on October 6 that the credibility of the Japanese government has declined, the government and political parties have separated, and the fate of the Ashida Cabinet hangs in the balance. As we expected, the Ashida Cabinet announced its resignation en masse on the 7th, citing the reason: "It is regrettable that Minister Kurisu has been summoned and tried for his involvement in the Showa Denko incident. As the head of the cabinet, I feel a moral responsibility and have decided to resign from the position of Prime Minister." Ashida fell in this dishonorable atmosphere, like a faded rose, losing its brilliance and splendor. It is believed that such a politician, praised by the Allied forces as one who has fully democratized Japan, will never be able to recover from such a ruthless fall in his life.</p>
<p>Ashida's downfall was not the wish of Ashida or the Democratic Party. But politics is ruthless. Ashida was forced to step down due to various circumstances, and it was an ignominious fall. One of the reasons is that the Kurisu corruption case involved a wide range of people, including former Deputy Prime Minister Suehiro Nishio, Setsuzo Hinohara, President of Showa Denko, Senichiro Ozawa, head of the Preparatory Committee for the Formation of the New Liberal Constitution, Sato, head of Mitsui Heavy Industries, Ito, Warden of Tokyo Prison, and Ono, industrial leader of the Democratic Liberal Party, who have been successively detained. The incumbent Okurasho Kitamura may also be detained soon, resulting in the loss of face for the government and the most shameful case of suspected corruption since the Meiji and Taisho eras. According to Nishio's confession in court on the 7th, Prime Minister Ashida was involved in the theft of two million US dollars of public funds, leaving Ashida speechless and unable to cope with the crisis, and had to announce his resignation to await the resolution of the court. The second reason is that the Socialist Party and the National Cooperative Party formally announced the withdrawal of their support for the cabinet and unanimously demanded that Ashida resign en masse to apologize to the people. If Ashida clings to his post and loses his political and moral responsibility, the Socialist Party will withdraw from the six ministries of the cabinet. Ashida was thus isolated and had to leave. The third reason is that the Allied forces did not provide support. MacArthur has always adopted an interventionist attitude towards the political turmoil in Japan. The two cabinets of Yoshida and Katayama collapsed under his interference. This time, MacArthur suddenly adopted a "hands-off" policy towards the Ashida Cabinet's predicament and was unwilling to directly support Ashida, thus losing his support. However, the Allied forces claimed that the Kurisu bribery case should not be the responsibility of all cabinet members, which indirectly reduced Ashida's involvement. Originally, Ashida was a person with the least sense of political responsibility. After the Nishio bribery case occurred, his attitude was so smooth that it was unpredictable. After the Kurisu corruption case occurred, he once again stated that he was not politically responsible, only feeling regret on a moral level, which is not the attitude of a politician at all. Ashida's cabinet resigned due to the above three circumstances, which was neither accidental nor unexpected. Ashida has become a political dross in Japan. Standing in the position of the Allied forces controlling Japan, we should let it be abandoned by the times without reservation.</p>
<p>Now, the most likely successor to the Ashida Cabinet, both legally and circumstantially, is the Democratic Liberal Party. Legally speaking, the Democratic Liberal Party occupies 151 seats out of the 466 seats in the House of Representatives (with 18 vacant seats), the Socialist Party occupies 110 seats, the Democratic Party occupies 90 seats, and other small conservative parties tend to lean towards the Democratic Liberal Party, so the Democratic Liberal Party should be the majority party in the House. At the same time, Shigeru Yoshida was the opposition party to the two cabinets of Katayama and Ashida, and it is logical that the Democratic Liberal Party should come forward to form a cabinet. From a circumstantial point of view, left-wing parties cannot rise under MacArthur's control of Japan, and the "middle-of-the-road line" of Katayama and Ashida has failed successively, which shows that there is no way for "centrist politics." Of course, the only option is to return to conservatism and lean to the right, which is obviously opening the way for Shigeru Yoshida. Yoshida is a stubborn diplomat whose strong personality is not suitable for political party life, and the party lacks talent. All of the party's central and local members are heavily imbued with the atmosphere of financial groups and landlords, and their reactionary political views are shocking. Shigeru Yoshida's desire to form a one-party cabinet and his disapproval of a multi-party coalition government fully demonstrate his stubborn and reactionary nature. However, according to the habits of Japanese politics today, the formation of a cabinet by the majority party must be approved by MacArthur. MacArthur does not feel particularly interested in Yoshida. If he agrees to Yoshida's formation of a one-party conservative cabinet, he will inevitably be criticized by the Allied countries and will demonstrate the failure of Japan's democratization over the past three years. It is not yet known whether MacArthur will agree to a one-party conservative cabinet or a multi-party conservative cabinet in his meeting with Yoshida, or whether he will support someone else to clean up the mess and hold new general elections. In short, the emergence of this new cabinet in Japan is not only a major test of future political trends in Japan, but also the greatest test of the Allied forces' policy of controlling Japan.

Current occupants are still allowed to participate in the bidding.</p>
<p>(2) Current occupants of enemy and puppet properties must vacate the premises within one month from the date of waiving the purchase. If they fail to relocate within the deadline, the Economic Supervisory Office, local government, military, and police agencies shall enforce the eviction.</p>

Representatives from local audit agencies shall also be invited to participate (the valuation methods will be determined separately).</p>
<p>(6) Enemy-built houses on private land shall be handled in accordance with the regulations for handling enemy and puppet buildings on private land in recovered areas. If enemy and puppet properties that were purchased or forcibly purchased can be redeemed by the original owners, the original owners may still request the right to prioritize paying the price to reclaim them, and are not subject to these measures.</p>
<p>(7) If private properties have been improved or renovated by the enemy or puppets, the original owners shall be allowed to prioritize purchasing the improved or renovated parts.</p>

<h3>Supplementary Measures to Stabilize the Value of the Gold Yuan: Proposal by Legislator Shen Chongyu and 126 Others (Full Text)</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 13th] A proposal by Legislator Shen Chongyu and 126 others to supplement measures to stabilize the value of the Gold Yuan, in order to enhance the credibility of the currency system and facilitate its implementation, is as follows:</p>
<p>Reasons: The key to maintaining the value of the Gold Yuan lies in establishing credibility and increasing production. When Kong Xiangxi and others replaced silver dollars with the legal tender (fabi), it was successful because the government was able to maintain the currency's credibility, the public did not fear malignant inflation, there was no conversion problem between the old and new currencies, and there were no significant price fluctuations. Therefore, even after the outbreak of the War of Resistance, the currency's value was maintained for two or three years without a significant decline. Unfortunately, the government first damaged its credibility by misappropriating the currency reserve and ignoring US dollar savings bonds and US dollar public bonds from before the 25th year of the Republic (Kong Xiangxi still had foreign exchange, gold, and silver worth approximately 900 million US dollars when he was in office, and Song Ziwen still had over 300 million when he left office). Therefore, the current problem is the existence of credibility, rather than insufficient controls. What is called credibility is the re-creation of credibility, not the continued maintenance of credibility. Therefore, cultivating credibility is the first priority for establishing a currency system. The amount of currency that society can absorb is directly proportional to the size of its productive capacity. If productive capacity is small, even if the amount issued is small, there will be a surplus of funds, which will cause malignant inflation. Conversely, if productive capacity is large, even if the amount issued is large, it will be backed by real goods, and not only will there be no feeling of inflation, but it will also promote the people's livelihood. However, in general, all production industries are showing signs of decline. Even in Shanghai, the surplus of electricity and unusually bright lights are due to factory closures, which is a clear indication. It must be understood that shrinking production will reduce tax revenues, and the proportion of government spending maintained by issuing currency will increase. Shrinking production will also reduce the capacity to absorb currency, both of which will make society feel uncertain about currency inflation. Therefore, increasing production is the second priority for stabilizing the value of the currency.</p>
<p>For the above reasons, we hereby propose the following supplementary measures to stabilize the value of the Gold Yuan:</p>
<p>(A) Regarding Cultivating Issuance Credibility</p>
<p>(1) Expand and reorganize the existing Issuance Supervision Committee, increasing the number of members. The candidates for the committee should be selected from each region of the country who have a reputation in finance and financial matters.</p>
<p>(Explanation) China has a vast territory and inconvenient transportation. In order to make the entire population trust the agency that manages the issuance, the character of the people in this managing and issuing agency must be such that the people in each area using the Gold Yuan have a considerable understanding of them and believe that they can be trusted. Although many of the people currently appointed to the Issuance Supervision Committee are well-known figures, they are mostly concentrated in Shanghai, and the people in the hinterland and remote provinces are mostly unfamiliar with them. Therefore, it is necessary to expand and reorganize the committee. To avoid having too many people and making it difficult to be flexible, three or five standing committee members can be mutually elected from the committee to be responsible for day-to-day affairs, and a full meeting can be held every half month or month. This Issuance Supervision Committee is not only an agency for supervising the issuance, its main role should be to re-create the credibility of the issuance. Therefore, its duties should include: 1. Being able to participate in managing and applying the issuance reserves (including the materials in the next clause). 2. Being able to control the amount of issuance. (Continued on page 4)</p>

<h3>Korean Situation Becomes Increasingly Chaotic: Soviet Union Recognizes North Korean Regime, Exchange of Notes Establishes Foreign Relations, South Korea Condemns North Korean Organization as Illegal and Ineligible to Attend the UN</h3>
<p>[United Press, London, 13th] Soviet Radio in Moscow broadcast on the 13th that Premier Stalin, in response to Premier Kim Il-sung of the North Korean People's Democratic Republic, stated that the Soviet Union is willing to establish diplomatic relations with North Korea.</p>
<p>[United Press, Moscow, 13th] Soviet Marshal Stalin and North Korean Chairman of the Council of Ministers Kim Il-sung established diplomatic relations between the Soviet Union and the "Korean People's Democratic Republic" on the 13th through an exchange of notes. This move was expected after the Soviet government announced last month that it would withdraw its troops from Korea. Other Eastern European countries will follow suit and recognize North Korea.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Moscow, 13th] Moscow Radio announced this morning that Marshal Stalin, on behalf of the Soviet government, acknowledged receiving a letter from North Korean Premier Kim Il-sung on the 8th, urging the establishment of diplomatic and economic relations and the exchange of ambassadors between the two countries. In his reply, Stalin stated: "He has always supported the right of the Korean people to establish an independent government, welcomes the Korean people's organization of a government, and is willing to see them work to complete the restoration and democratic development." Moscow Radio also stated that Stalin's reply was sent on October 12th.</p>
<p>[New Asia News Agency, Seoul, 13th] Pyongyang Broadcasting quoted a report from the North Korean Central News Agency stating that rallies are being held daily throughout North Korea to bid farewell to the returning Soviet troops. Many liberation memorial towers and Soviet military memorial towers and Soviet military bases have been built in various places. At the rallies in Haizhou, Nanan, Hamhung, and Pyongyang, citizens shouted slogans such as "Korean-Soviet Friendship."</p>
<p>[United Press, Seoul, 13th] An American man who returned here on the evening of the 12th from the border between the US and the Soviet Union stated that the Soviet troops are withdrawing from the border and being replaced by North Korean troops. The North Korean army fired light weapons at the American army, which retaliated with heavy weapons and defeated them.

<p>[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 12th] The South Korean delegation to the United Nations issued a statement today stating: "The nine members of the Korean delegation are now in Paris awaiting an opportunity to present the case of the Republic of Korea government to the United Nations General Assembly. The Korean delegation has formally requested that Korean representatives be allowed to participate in the First Committee when the Korean issue is discussed." The statement continued: "The establishment of the Republic of Korea was due to a popular election agreed to and supervised by a United Nations Commission. Two-thirds of the people in the country participated in the election, while the other one-third were unable to participate because the Soviet-occupied zone refused to allow the United Nations Commission to work." The statement further pointed out that the North Korean regime is a self-proclaimed "dictatorial regime," and therefore, in law, the North Korean regime cannot represent the Korean people. Only the South Korean delegation can represent the people and attend the United Nations General Assembly.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 13th] The South Korean delegation in Paris on the 12th denounced the Pyongyang regime, saying that it cannot be allowed to attend the United Nations to present its views on Korea.</p>
<h3>Under Soviet Control: Eastern European Countries Plan Alliance for Foreign and Economic Cooperation to Counter Western Europe</h3>
<p>[United Press, Prague, 12th] Reliable sources claimed on the 12th that the Soviet Union has decided to conclude an Eastern European alliance to counter the Western European alliance. The decision to organize the Eastern European "People's Democratic Alliance" is believed to have been made at a meeting of senior Eastern European political leaders in Crimea last month, and is expected to be announced soon.</p>
<p>It is said that the Eastern European alliance will include countries such as Poland, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Bulgaria, and Romania. It is also said that the planners of this plan also hope to recruit Yugoslavia to join, even though it has been expelled from the Cominform. The inclusion of the Soviet-occupied zone of Austria is also said to be under consideration, and the inclusion of East Germany will be considered later. The exact form of the proposed Eastern European alliance has not been disclosed, but it is said that dozens of experts from the participating countries will meet in Prague this week to draft a detailed plan. The Eastern European alliance is expected to focus on economic cooperation, possibly starting with a customs union between these countries and long-term cooperation in economic planning. The organization will be under Soviet control, but will not merge into the Soviet Union or form a new country. It may follow the form of the Benelux customs union. Each participating country will retain its own government and foreign representatives, and the cooperation in foreign policy, which has already been realized in practice, will inevitably be greatly strengthened under this plan.</p>
<h3>Soviet Union Demands Withdrawal of Military Missions from China, Australia, etc. in Berlin</h3>
<p>[Reported by This Newspaper] London, 13th, broadcast from Berlin: The Soviet Union has suggested that countries such as China, India, Australia, and the Netherlands close their military missions stationed in Berlin and withdraw to their home countries. There are at least fifteen military missions stationed with the Four-Power Control Committee. According to the Soviet official news agency, regarding the military missions of various countries, the Soviet Commander in Germany, Sokolovsky, has stated to the commanders of the United States, Britain, and France: "The military missions of various countries are stationed with the Four-Power Control Committee. Now that the Control Committee no longer exists, the stationed missions are also no longer possible." It is said that the Western military governors have not yet announced their position on the Soviet proposal. According to the Four-Power Control Committee, since the Soviet Union announced on March 20th that "the Committee no longer exists," it has not held a meeting. At the same time, the Western powers have not recognized the Soviet Union's unilateral attempt to dissolve the Control Committee.</p>
<h3>Berlin Municipal Council Moves to British Zone</h3>

<h3>Our Attitude Unchanged in Opposing Western Participation in the UN General Assembly</h3>
<p>Recognizing North Korean Election as Illegal</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Paris, 12th] Chiang Tingfu, our country's representative to the United Nations, stated today that China will vote against allowing Spain to participate in the United Nations when the issue is raised for discussion, because Spain's situation remains the same as in the past. When China refuses to allow participation, he stated that allowing new member states must be unanimously approved by the five permanent members of the Security Council. Regarding the issue of the Pyongyang regime requesting to send representatives to attend the United Nations, as requested by Moscow Radio, Chiang stated that the Korean government was produced under the supervision of representatives sent by the United Nations, but how the election in North Korea was conducted is unknown to the world.</p>
<h3>If the Soviet Union Has Sincere Intentions for Peace, It Should Abandon the Fifth Column: British Representative Challenges Vyshinsky</h3>
<p>[United Press, Paris, 13th] British representative Sir Alexander Cadogan, during the disarmament debate in the Political Committee of the UN General Assembly today, urged the Soviet Union to abandon using the "fifth column of covert armies of the Communist Party" as part of its disarmament plan. Cadogan stated that as long as the Soviet Union maintains the fifth column worldwide, its proposal to disarm one-third of its forces within one year is "meaningless," because the fifth column aims to sabotage economic recovery and create political chaos.</p>
<p>He stated, "If the Soviet Union is sincere about the return of confidence and stability to the earth, it should lift the Iron Curtain, as 'a card laid on the table.'" Cadogan challenged the Soviet Union, saying, "When you ask us to support your plan, are you also willing to sign a convention to abandon your fifth column and stop all plans to sabotage the recovery of Europe and Asia? We do not object even if the Soviet Union does not allow the existence of opposition parties and propaganda that is hostile to the government within its own country. What we object to is the Soviet-led underground sabotage and reckless propaganda. The efforts of France, China, Italy, Iran, Indonesia, and Malaya to achieve economic recovery and the rise of democracy are all hindered by foreign-guided Communist actions. Moscow only needs to say one word, and those countries can flourish. You say you do not want war, perhaps that is so, but history proves that even Hitler did not thirst for war. But you hope to achieve victory without war. Therefore, while holding powerful military forces that make the world uneasy, you are also using the fifth column in every country." Cadogan urged the Soviet Union to reconsider, make concessions on the control of atomic energy and disarmament, and responded to Vyshinsky's statement that Cadogan's and his opinions differed because "we have different hearts" by saying: "This statement is sad, and I hope and believe it is not correct, because my heart, like the heart of my country, hopes for peace, not a peace of enslavement or a peace of annihilation, but a peace of glory and friendship for all mankind. Appeasement cannot achieve this, and the lessons of the past are clear. I will use an objective and peaceful attitude to solve it in a more calm atmosphere with reasonable, practical, and effective methods."</p>
<h3>Malik Counterattacks</h3>
<p>[Associated Press] Paris, 13th, broadcast: Soviet representative Malik, in his rebuttal to Cadogan in the Political Committee, accused his speech of being full of "lies and slanders," "picking up the remnants of Trotsky, Hitler, and Goebbels." He strongly stated that there is no so-called Iron Curtain for those who are willing to cooperate with the Soviet Union and those who need peace and friendship. Malik stated, "The Soviet Union needs coordination. We had no difficulty reaching an agreement with Roosevelt, but people like Cadogan seem to have no need for agreement."</p>
<h3>Vyshinsky's Remarks Involve the Chinese Communist Party: Chiang Tingfu Issues a Statement, Saying It Violates the Spirit of the Sino-Soviet Treaty</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Paris, 12th] Although our country does not want to discuss domestic issues in international meetings, in the past day, the Political Committee of the UN General Assembly specifically mentioned the rebellion of the Chinese Communist Party during its disarmament debate. The extremely different opinions of the United States and the Soviet Union on China have forced us to make a statement. The statement issued by Chiang Tingfu, our representative to the United Nations, stated that China can never accept the Soviet proposal to reduce one-third of its troops, which has caused an open debate between the United States and the Soviet Union on Chinese affairs. Soviet representative Vyshinsky announced his views on China this afternoon, while US representative Austin informally supported our government in refuting other issues. Chiang Tingfu, our representative, refuted Vyshinsky's attack on China, saying that this move was purely irrelevant. People in our country here said, "Vyshinsky's accusations directly violate the provisions in the Sino-Soviet Treaty that the Soviet Union supports the Chinese government in spirit or material."</p>
<h3>French Representative Proposes New Disarmament Proposal: Debate in Political Committee Ends</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 13th] The Political Committee of the UN General Assembly continued its meeting at 10:50 this morning to discuss the Soviet disarmament proposal. French representative Parodi announced that he was moving to draft a resolution that would include all the key points of the debate so far. The resolution stated that the General Assembly would recommend the following to the Security Council: (1) Establish a control agency to control the number of troops and old weapons of each country based on the statements submitted by the governments to the control agency within a certain period, and the control agency will conduct on-site investigations of the points stated in the governments' statements, and the United Nations Secretariat will publish the above statements. (2) Promote the gradual and universal limitation of armaments and conventional weapons. (3) Prepare a report on this matter, no later than the convening of the next regular session to discuss this proposal, so that the General Assembly can carry out its activities in accordance with the disarmament goals and principles stipulated in the Charter. At this point, Ukrainian representative Manuilsky urged to end the debate, saying that the debate "leads us to get involved in purely theoretical discussions." Chairman Spaak expressed his agreement, saying that lengthy speeches do not help solve the problem. Finally, after the representatives moved to end the debate, the motion was passed by a vote of 31 to 5 (11 abstentions), and the Political Committee adjourned at 12:55 noon.</p>
<h3>Mrs. Pandit to be Transferred as Ambassador to the United States</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, London, 13th (Associated Press)] It has been learned from authoritative sources that Mrs. Pandit, sister of Indian Prime Minister Nehru and current Indian Ambassador to the Soviet Union, will be transferred as Ambassador to the United States. Mrs. Pandit is currently the head of the Indian delegation to the UN General Assembly.

<h3>U.S. Military Preparations Aim to Prevent War</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Washington, 12th] U.S. Army Chief of Plans and Operations, General Weidemeyer, declared today that the purpose of U.S. military expansion is to deter war, not to prepare for war. Weidemeyer made a speech on television broadcasting entitled "To What Extent is the United States Approaching War?" Weidemeyer did not directly answer this question but stated that the U.S. military is engaged in preventing war by means of strength to secure peace and security. External accusations that the U.S. Army dominates U.S. foreign policy are incorrect. U.S. foreign policy is created by the American people, not by the Department of the Army. U.S. national policy is determined by the President, Congress, and the Department of State. When the people disagree with certain policies adopted by the executive branch, foreign policy is quickly corrected. The only thing that the U.S. military has to do with foreign policy is to ensure our support for policies at home and abroad, which is the true meaning of all our armed forces.</p>

Neutral diplomats pointed out that simultaneous negotiations and lifting the blockade are the only way to untie the Gordian knot of Berlin. Security Council President, Argentine Foreign Minister Bramuglia, is awaiting the Soviet response to his suggestion.</p>
<h3>Nehru to Go to Paris Tomorrow</h3>

<h3>French Cabinet Examines Wages to End Labor Strikes; Italian Civil Servants' General Strike for Nine Hours</h3>

<p>[Associated Press, Paris, 13th] French Prime Minister Guy Mollet convened a full cabinet meeting on the 13th to study the government's wage proposals in order to resolve the strike wave of 500,000 coal miners and other workers in basic industries.</p>

<h3>The New Japanese Cabinet is Delayed and Difficult to Produce; The Democratic and Liberal Parties are Conducting Black Market Negotiations; Nomination of the New Prime Minister Postponed Until Today</h3>
<p>[New Asia News Agency, Tokyo, 10th] The nomination election for the next Japanese Prime Minister, postponed for one day, was supposed to be held on the afternoon of the 13th. However, as a result of a meeting of the House Steering Committee of the House of Representatives at 5:35 p.m. today, it was decided to postpone it again for one day, to be held on the 14th. At the meeting, although the Liberal Party proposed holding it on the night of the 13th, the Democratic Party proposed postponing it to the 14th because there were still points that needed to be reviewed. At the request of the Liberal Party, the meeting was temporarily adjourned at 6:15 p.m. After the meeting reopened, it accommodated the opinions of all parties and decided to postpone it again for one day, adjourning at 7:07 p.m.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 13th] Rumors are circulating that Shigeru Yoshida, who was regarded as the "most likely candidate for Prime Minister," may be rejected. It is reported that Takeshi Yamazaki, Secretary-General of the Democratic Liberal Party, has been promoted as a "suitable candidate." However, this afternoon, Takeshi Yamazaki issued a statement frankly denying any intention of succeeding as Prime Minister. He told members of his party in parliament: "Even if appointed, I will never accept the position of Prime Minister."</p>
<p>[New Asia News Agency, Tokyo, 13th] Jiro Hoshijima, Chief Secretary of the Japanese Democratic Party, visited Democratic Party Secretary-General Kokumidi on the afternoon of the 12th to discuss the next cabinet. It is reported that regarding the issue of how to compromise on the Liberal Party's proposed conservative united front policy and the Democratic Party's proposed national unity policy, Hoshijima hoped that the Democratic Party would make slight concessions on the method of forming a cabinet, and the Liberal Party was willing to make concessions to the Democratic Socialist Party in terms of the number and positions of cabinet members. It is generally speculated that if this black market negotiation still cannot reach a compromise, the Democratic Party may cast blank ballots during the nomination of the Prime Minister. [Associated Press, Tokyo, 13th] The continued opposition of many political figures to Shigeru Yoshida, considering him a "reactionary," has delayed his anticipated selection as the new Prime Minister. When Allied officials declared that the decision on the selection of the new Prime Minister was entirely a matter for the Japanese themselves, some Japanese political figures spread rumors that MacArthur did not want Yoshida to serve as Prime Minister again. Yoshida was first appointed Prime Minister by Emperor Hirohito in May 1946 and collapsed in May 1947. According to the previous procedures of the Diet, when there is no clear majority party in the Diet, the leader of the majority party will be elected as Prime Minister. In this case, Yoshida would be the most suitable candidate, as the Democratic Liberal Party holds 151 of the 466 seats in the House of Representatives. However, Yoshida's opponents argue that because he is a reactionary, his election will have a negative national impact. Yoshida's supporters are urging the Diet to convene a plenary session of the House of Representatives on the 13th to elect the Prime Minister so that the election can proceed before opponents can form a collective to obstruct his election. It is reported that former Prime Minister Ashida, who collapsed from the cabinet, also opposes Yoshida, mainly due to the long-term competition between the two in the past.</p>
<h3>On Colonial Issues, Britain and the United States Oppose Soviet Proposals</h3>

<h3>Indonesian Communist Party Leaders Arrested</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Batavia, 12th] Radio Indonesia reported on the 12th that twelve Indonesian Communist Party leaders had been arrested.

<h3>British Imperial Conference Reviewed; Far East and Middle East Situation; British Commonwealth Plans to Dissuade India from Establishing a Republic</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, London, 12th] The British Commonwealth Prime Ministers' Conference has been held for two days. According to an official announcement, the meeting discussed the international situation, especially the Middle East and Far East issues. British High Commissioner for Southeast Asia MacDonald gave a detailed account of the situation in Malaya. According to well-informed sources here, the discussion at today's meeting on the unrest in Southeast Asia focused on constructive methods to eliminate this unrest and communist activities, and on improving the living conditions of the indigenous people. Although staff officers participated in the meeting, specific defense issues have been postponed for discussion. It is also heard that Foreign Secretary Bevin gave his views on several other issues in Asia at the meeting, including the Japanese peace treaty. The Commonwealth, especially those in the Pacific, intends to participate as closely as possible in the Japanese peace conference.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, London, 12th] British Foreign Secretary Bevin warned in his speech at the Commonwealth Conference on the 12th that the Far East and the Middle East are weak links in the chain of anti-communist defense. Bevin spoke for more than an hour on taking various measures to strengthen defense loopholes, especially in Malaya, where Britain recently sent troops to suppress the communist rebellion. He focused on the communist issue in the Far East.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, London, 13th] The Prime Ministers of the British Commonwealth countries are extremely anxious because India's possible withdrawal from the Commonwealth will create a major loophole in the global anti-communist strategy. The Commonwealth Conference continued to discuss the economy on the 13th. Behind-the-scenes negotiations have begun to try to dissuade India's 400 million people from establishing an independent republic. New Zealand and Australia, deeply aware of the danger of this move, have issued warnings. This issue is considered extremely serious. Some suggested that if a deadlock is reached, the opinion of the United States should be sought. New Zealand Prime Minister Fraser, speaking on behalf of the Far Eastern countries, said that the greatest hope for peace lies in whether the Far Eastern countries can urge India not to withdraw from the Commonwealth, thereby weakening the worldwide anti-communist chain.</p>

After receiving the order, Director Yu of the Police Bureau immediately convened relevant agencies and trade associations at the bureau's seventh floor to discuss various issues. More than 40 representatives from the Fishing Wheel Industry Association, the Tofu Industry Association, the Fish Trade Association, the Fish Peddlers' Mutual Benefit Association, the Marine Products Marketing Association, the Shanghai Fish Market, the Vegetable Industry Association, the Local Goods Trade Association, the First and Second Markets of the Vegetable and Local Goods Joint Venture, the Second District Vegetable Market Mutual Aid Association, the Seventh District Vegetable Market Stall Owners' Mutual Aid Association, the Chicken and Duck Trade Association, the Fourth and Eleventh District Tile Aid Associations, and the Social Bureau, the Finance Bureau, the Health Bureau, and other agencies attended. It was resolved that, in addition to the authorities resolving the various difficulties of the city's small vegetable markets, all vendors should be fully responsible for the supply of vegetables under the principle of not exceeding the price limit to ensure that the supply is not lacking. It was also decided to order the trade associations of each industry to organize joint operating organizations to eliminate the black market. The detailed measures are being drafted by the Police Bureau.</p>
<h3>Agreed on a Method for Rationing Fish; Unified Distribution Begins Today; Fishmongers No Longer Need to Queue</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] Regarding the fish industry in the city, the Fish Market Brokers Association accused the Fishmongers' Mutual Benefit Association of disrupting the fish rationing system, and the Fishmongers' Mutual Benefit Association refuted it, accusing the brokers of colluding with scalpers to manipulate fish prices, which once caused disputes. To mediate the conflict between the two, the Fish Market specially invited the Brokers' Association, the Fishmongers' Mutual Benefit Association, the Fishing Wheel Association, the 14th Brigade of the Youth Service Corps, and other relevant fishery groups to hold a meeting at the market yesterday. The focus of the meeting was on how to improve the fish distribution method and eliminate the black market for fish. The Fishmongers' Mutual Benefit Association stated that fish supplies are currently in the off-season, with not much arriving. More than 4,000 fishmongers queue up every day to wait for distribution. Due to insufficient distribution, half of the fishmongers are often unable to purchase fish, resulting in some areas of the city being short of fish, while others have no fish at all. Black market fish prices have therefore occurred, so improvements were requested. After discussion, eight concrete measures were decided, which will be implemented after being approved by the authorities as soon as possible. Among them, the measure that will be implemented starting today is that fishmongers no longer need to queue up. They only need to register at the market from 1:00 p.m. to 4:00 p.m. the day before, obtain a job certificate, and distribute the fish in a unified manner according to the amount of fish. It is heard that the industry will continue to hold a meeting at the City Fisheries Association this afternoon to continue discussing issues related to fish distribution.</p>
<h3>The Only Hope for Silver Shops is to Solve the Raw Material Problem</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] According to Wu Pengnian, Chairman of the Silver Shop Association, the industry's recent application to the Social Bureau for permission to suspend business was truly a last resort. During the recent buying spree, the daily income of the silver seed industry from old gold jewelry was almost non-existent, while buyers and exchangers came every day to investigate. The gold reserves of the industry were almost exhausted, and business could not continue. It was necessary to request a temporary suspension of business so that it could continue to open its doors when the market situation stabilized. The industry's only hope is still to solve the problem of raw materials for jewelry gold. It is now waiting for the authorities to promulgate the management measures for the silver shop industry to follow.</p>
<h3>Rationing Coal Briquettes; 1.5 Million Dan Decided to be Made</h3>

It was decided that the Machine-Made Coal Briquette Industry Association would produce 1.5 million dan of coal briquettes to be distributed in stages. The target and price of the rationing will be finalized and announced.</p>
<h3>Appeal of Defendants in the Dance Hall Case; Criminal Division of the High Court Pronounced Judgment Yesterday; Sentences of Zhu Fei and 13 Others Increased or Decreased; Jin Ying and 11 Others Treated Leniently, All Given Suspended Sentences</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] The Criminal Division of the High Court pronounced judgment yesterday on the appeals of the defendants in the dance hall case. The main text: "The original judgment regarding the crimes and sentences of Zhu Fei and others is revoked. Zhu Fei is sentenced to three years of imprisonment for openly gathering a crowd and jointly implementing violence and coercion when a civil servant was performing his duties according to law. Zeng Zhigang and Pan Zhiguang are sentenced to one and a half years of imprisonment for openly gathering a crowd and jointly implementing violence and coercion when a civil servant was performing his duties according to law. Li Meijuan, Ruan Jianmin, Zhao Aqing, Gu Kerren, Lu Jialin, Yu Zhiqin, Li Ying, Wang Danglin, Zhu Caigen, and Shi Meifang are sentenced to six months of imprisonment for openly gathering a crowd and jointly implementing violence and coercion when a civil servant was performing his duties according to law. Cheng Yinkang, Qin Xianfen, and Jin Ying are sentenced to three months of imprisonment, with a three-year suspended sentence. Li Genfang, Xu Jiecai, Xia Shaotang, Wang Xianliang, Meng Yan, and Sun Zhimin are sentenced to three months of imprisonment, with a three-year suspended sentence, for aiding others who were implementing violence and coercion against civil servants performing their duties according to law. Jin Meihong is sentenced to two months of imprisonment, with a two-year suspended sentence, for aiding others who were openly gathering a crowd to implement violence and coercion against civil servants performing their duties according to law. Other appeals are dismissed. Chen Ayao, two-year suspended sentence."</p>
<h3>Reasons for the Verdict</h3>
<p>The High Court's reasons for the judgment in this case: (1) Zhu's crime, the original sentence of four years, was changed to three years, based on the testimony of Song Tingjun, the director of the Songshan Police Station: "There was no prior conspiracy, it was purely a spur-of-the-moment decision." Therefore, Zhu was not the "mastermind," which can be determined, and the original judgment sentencing him as the mastermind seemed inappropriate. (2) Zeng Zhigang and Pan Zhiguang, originally sentenced to three years and six months, were changed to one and a half years. Because both of them were not first-time offenders, and their circumstances were lighter than Zhu Fei, they should be dealt with leniently. (3) Li Meijuan, Ruan Jianmin, Zhao Aqing, and Gu Keren, originally sentenced to one year, were changed to six months. Lu Jialin, Yu Zhiqin, Li Ying, Wang Fulin, Zhu Caigen, and Shi Meifang, originally sentenced to five months, were changed to six months. The original judgment only considered the act of damaging public property, but it was also a kind of implementing violence and coercion, the same as assaulting police officers. It cannot be said that there was no connection in intent, which obviously has a relationship of violence and coercion to obstruct official duties. It should be punished with the more severe offense, and not only for damaging public property. (4) Cheng Shikang, Qin Xianfen, and Jin Yingjun are all 18 years old and have their sentences reduced according to law, and have not received a sentence of imprisonment. It is considered appropriate not to execute the sentence, which is in accordance with the Probation Regulations. (5) Regarding Li Genfang, Xu Jiecai, Xia Shaotang, Wang Xianliang, Meng Yan, Sun Zhimin, and Jin Meihong: The defendants consistently denied that they jointly implemented violence and coercion at the scene. After careful investigation, although the appellants did not commit other violent acts, their support at the scene was extremely obvious, and none of them can be exempted from guilt. Considering that the appellants have not received a sentence of imprisonment, the court agreed to the principle of non-execution and should grant probation. However, Jin Meihong has not reached the legal age and her sentence is reduced according to law, and then granted probation. (6) Regarding the part of dismissing the appeal: Yu Jinbao and Zhao Zhengxiang were sentenced to one year of imprisonment in the first instance in accordance with Article 136, paragraph 1, and Article 138 of the Criminal Law, which is not inappropriate. The appeal should be considered unreasonable and dismissed. Furthermore, Chen A's case has no prior criminal record and is also in accordance with the Probation Regulations. It is appropriate not to execute the sentence for the time being, and it should be known that probation is granted.</p>
<h3>Youth Service Team Tours the City to Serve</h3>
<p>The Youth Service Headquarters has planned to organize "Mobile Service Teams," dispatching 20 to 40 teams daily to tour the city for service, investigating the black market and accepting confidential reports from the people. Its nature is equivalent to the "People's Service Station" and supplements its inadequacies.</p>
<h3>Huang Pinfa Invents a Mileage Calculator for Rickshaws</h3>
<p>Recently, rickshaw pullers have been arbitrarily raising prices, which the citizens deeply suffer from. Huang Pinfa, a mechanic, after more than a month of research, has recently invented a "mileage calculator." Yesterday, Mr. Huang took it to the Central Bank to meet with supervisor Jiang Jingguo. Mr. Jiang specially appointed Deputy Director Zhang Shiyan of the Police Department to meet him. Zhang highly praised Mr. Huang's invention of the mileage calculator and promised to forward it to the Municipal Government's Social Affairs Bureau and Public Utilities Bureau for filing. The "calculator" is quite similar to an ordinary clock. The surface has numbers from one to twelve, with only a long and short hand. One rotation of the long hand is equal to traveling one mile, and one rotation of the short hand is equal to traveling twelve miles. The odometer is installed on the left side of the seat back, and the mechanism is installed on the axles of the rickshaw and handcart. Once the wheels turn, the long hand on the odometer will automatically rotate. In the future, if the authorities set the fare for each mile of the rickshaw, passengers can see the mileage indicated on the odometer before getting on and off the car, and pay the fare. It is extremely fair and can reduce many unnecessary disputes between rickshaw pullers and passengers.</p>
<p>Can prevent rickshaw pullers from arbitrarily raising prices. Reduce many unnecessary disputes.</p>
<h3>Qiantang Express Train Damaged, Delayed by Three Hours, Travelers Frowned</h3>
<p>[Our newspaper's report] The Qiantang Express train directly to Beijing and Hangzhou was delayed for three hours yesterday, arriving in Shanghai at 4:40 PM. Due to the delay of the Qiantang Express, the 5th, 17th, 11th, and 15th express trains were also delayed. It is reported that the Qiantang Express drove to Kunshan, 52 kilometers away from Shanghai, at 1:11 PM. The right driving rotary handle of the locomotive suddenly broke, and the train could not move forward. An urgent telegram was sent to the Weiting Station to remove the locomotive of the 51st train and drive it to send the Qiantang Express to Kunshan Station for another locomotive to be replaced. However, due to the various procedures of disassembly and transfer, a lot of time was wasted, and the passengers were all displeased.</p>
<h3>No. 2 Route B Public Bus to be Changed to Shuttle Bus from Tomorrow, No. 14 to Temporarily Stop at the Mint Bridge</h3>
<p>[Our newspaper's report] The No. 2 Route B public bus, run by the Municipal Public Utilities Bureau, originally ran from Laoximen to Zhongshan North Road. In response to the requests of residents in the northern district, it has been decided to change the bus route to a shuttle bus at Qiujiang Road from tomorrow, specifically running the Qiujiang Road-Zhongshan North Road shuttle bus, and increasing the number of vehicles. The original No. 2 buses will still run the original route, from Laoximen to Qiujiang Road.</p>
<p>The western terminus of the No. 14 public bus was extended from Ziyulu Mint Bridge to Xitang Road, which was quite convenient for residents there. However, the road surface is currently damaged and dangerous for vehicles to pass through. The public transportation company has decided to continue to use the Mint Bridge as the terminus from tomorrow until the road surface condition between the Mint Bridge and Xikang Road improves, and then resume driving.</p>
<h3>First Hearing of the Fuel Management Committee Case, Trial Lasts Eight Hours, Yang Yunfu Claims Distribution was Handled According to Old Regulations, Sun Jice Denies Sharing the Difference in Black Market Coal Prices</h3>
<p>[Our newspaper's report] Xie Zhiying, a judge of the District Court, heard the case of Yang Yunfu, the former director of the Transportation Department of the Shanghai Fuel Management Committee, and Sun Jice, the director of the Allocation Department of the committee, colluding with coal merchants) in embezzlement and malfeasance, in the Criminal Court 8 yesterday morning at 9 a.m. Yang Yunfu, the director of the Transport Department of the Defendant Fuel Management Committee, Zou Jidao, a staff member and coal merchant, Zhao Bojun, a retired military officer, Mao Meixuan, a coal merchant, and Sun Jice, the former director of the Allocation Department of the Fuel Management Committee, Lin Keying, the chief of the section, Miao Shouzi, Dai Weihua, Xu Baoguang, Ren Hui, Sun Zhigang, a clerk of the Jiangzhe Inland River Shipping Company, and coal merchant Han Chengpu, were brought to court. More than a dozen witnesses, including Pan Zongli, Huang Yuncheng, Zhou Xinghuang, Chen Songshou, Bao Ruizhen (female), Yan Azhang, Xu Shouchen, Yu Quejin, Cai Hexian, Ge Jianhua, Shen Tieshi, Li Huaqing, Zhang Tiancai, and Chen Renshou, were also summoned, as well as Tang Keyue and Le Zhuangxin, officials of the Municipal Government Investigation Office handling the case, and Wang Sizu, the leader of the action team of the Jingjing Brigade, appeared in court. In addition, more than 20 other witnesses who should have been summoned, including He Zhiying, Shi Jianren, Wang Jianping, Ma Zhongliang, Chen Dong, Lu Zhida, Xie Wenguang, Chi Yunfei, Wang Qinfei, Qiu Tongwen, and Chen Zhizhang, did not appear in court. The court session began at 9 a.m. yesterday and ended at about 6 p.m., excluding a one-hour lunch break. The whole-day trial lasted eight hours and was not concluded. It is scheduled to be retried on the 20th.</p>
<p>More than 200 family members of the defendants attended yesterday's opening trial, and the seats were full. Yang Yunfu hired as many as six defense lawyers. The atmosphere in the court was solemn and quite tense. Judge Xie took his seat, called the defendants to the court in turn, asked about their age and origin, and immediately declared: Each defendant has not committed any crimes before, and should truthfully state their case. If they have committed a crime due to a temporary mistake, the law can grant forgiveness. If they evade the answer, and it is confirmed by investigation, the penalty will be increased. After speaking, he began to interrogate each defendant.</p>
<p>Arrested While Exchanging Money and Documents</p>
<p>The first defendant, Yang Yunfu, was wearing a brown suit with a worried expression on his face. He first responded by saying that he had worked on the Xiangqian and Qiangui railways, and on June 20, 1936, he took office as the director of the Transportation Department of the Fuel Management Committee, responsible for the safekeeping of coal. Transportation was the responsibility of the shipping department. Four coal mines in Taiwan, Kailuan, Huadong, and Huainan produced coal, which was purchased and distributed by the committee. Other coal mines were freely purchased and transported by coal merchants. The distribution measures of the committee were handled in accordance with the old regulations. Zhao Bojun responded by saying that he graduated from the 10th term of the military academy in 1927 and served as the colonel commander of the Special Task Force of the Military Commission. After retiring last year, he was introduced by a certain Ma from the Ministry of National Defense and obtained a position from Yang Yunfu. Initially, there was no contact with coal transportation. Later, because he served as the liaison officer of the "Yishe," a people's organization in the Central Hotel in this city, he became acquainted with Chen Zhiqiang, a classmate of the 3rd term of the military academy, who is now an official of the Municipal Government Investigation Office. Chen said to him that a friend who was not a coal merchant wanted to transport coal to Tianjin and needed to prepare a purchase certificate. He asked him to find a way. He then discussed with Yang Yunfu, who introduced him to Shen Jing, a coal merchant of Gongda Coal Company, to apply for it. Chen was willing to pay 3 billion yuan as a guarantee for tax payment. He and Chen's friend had never met. On September 14, he was arrested at the Queen's Cafe when exchanging money and documents, and he realized that Chen had framed him out of suspicion.</p>
<p>Tang Kejun Recounts the Case-Solving Process</p>
<p>Tang Kejun, an official of the Municipal Government Investigation Office who was ordered to design and solve the case under the pseudonym Tang Gengsheng, testified that two months ago, he was ordered to investigate the malfeasance case of the Fuel Management Committee. He pretended to Chen Zhiqiang that a friend wanted to transport 500 tons of coal to Tianjin. Chen replied that a classmate named Zhao often applied for purchase certificates for others and agreed to give a handling fee of 3 billion yuan as a reward. He reported it to his superiors. On August 7 of the old calendar, he first paid 500 million. Zhao made an appointment to meet at the Lao Zhenxing Restaurant on the 13th to give the remaining payment. On the due date, Lao Zhenxing was closely arranged, but Zhao said that the purchase certificate could not be obtained until the next day, and an appointment was made to meet at the Queen's Cafe on the 14th. At that time, Zhao and his girlfriend Bao Ruizhen were there first, and they handed over the purchase certificate. He first paid 2.5 billion yuan to Chen Zhiqiang, and Chen actually paid Zhao 2.2 billion (including 300 million yuan as Chen's kickback). After the money and documents were exchanged, Wang Sizu, the leader of the action team, immediately led the police to seize the money and goods on the spot, and took them to the bureau for interrogation. Then, Wang Sizu stated in detail how Tang Kejun used a pseudonym to solve the case, and how the numbers of the money paid by Tang were recorded in advance. Zou Jidao was then interrogated. According to the testimony, he was a coal merchant before, and then, introduced by the Coal Industry Association, he served as a staff member in the Fuel Management Committee and jointly opened Gongda Coal Company with Mao Meixuan. He was responsible for investigating the quantity and price of coal in the committee. He was not acquainted with Zhao Bojun. Applying for the purchase certificate in the name of Gongda was instructed by Yang Yunfu.</p>
<p>Giving Travel Expenses May Have Happened</p>
<p>At this point, the court summoned Le Zhuangxin, the person in charge of the Municipal Government, to provide evidence. Le said that Yang Yunfu had confessed in the police station that Gongda applied for purchase certificates on behalf of other merchants, and that Yang often borrowed money from Zou Jidao. Yang argued that applying for purchase certificates on behalf of others was a misunderstanding of urging the issuance of certificates at the meeting. Borrowing money from Zou occasionally happened, and there were no other monetary exchanges. The court reprimanded the supervisor for borrowing money from his subordinates as a strange thing.</p>
<p>At noon, the court adjourned for a rest. At 1:10 p.m., the trial continued, and Zou Jidao was repeatedly questioned about soliciting bribes from coal merchants. Yang Yunfu testified that last year, the output of Huadong and Huainan mines increased by more than 70,000 tons. Coal merchants sought profits and asked Nanjing to approve the purchase. Minister Chen Qitian once instructed that Shanghai was short of coal and authorized to relax restrictions on commercial transportation. The coal merchants reported for inspection. In order to speed up the process, it may have been the case that Zou Junma paid fees. The court then asked Zou Jidao about the photos of various checks seized by the Municipal Government. According to the testimony, one check for 74 million yuan was collected by Miao Suizi on behalf of Yang's salary. The other checks were for the sale of five loads of coal balls entrusted by Miao Shouzi, Dai Weihua, Xu Baoguang, and Ren Hui, and he denied soliciting bribes from coal merchants.</p>
<p>Knowing it was a Bribe, We Understood Each Other Without Speaking</p>
<p>The court summoned Chen Renshou, an intelligence officer of a certain bureau who worked in the committee. Chen said that according to the investigation, coal merchants transported coal, and Zhang Ren, the Customs Broker of Zhang Jinji, collected handling fees on their behalf, losing 20,000 to 80,000 yuan per ton. Afterwards, there was a continuous increase. On August 17, Zou paid him 42 million yuan in the name of discount interest. On August 22, he received 14 gold yuan. On September 6, he received 25 yuan and four cents in gold yuan. At that time, because he did not want to expose his identity, he did not ask about the source of each payment. After receiving the money, he submitted it to the Municipal Government. Other colleagues also received the same amount of money. They may have known that it was a bribe, and they understood each other without speaking. Subsequently, coal merchants Zhou Xinghuang, Huang Yuncheng, Pan Zongli, Xu Shouchen, Ge Jianhua, and Chen Songshou successively responded and said that they had paid money to Zhang Jinji Customs Brokerage as Zou Jidao's travel expenses, with varying amounts. Zhang Tiancai was asked, and he did not deny it.</p>
<p>Distributing Coal According to Three Standards</p>
<p>The court then interrogated Sun Jice and others about soliciting bribes from merchants for applying for coal distribution during their tenure in the office, or reselling the remaining coal on the black market and dividing the profits. Han Chengxun, who supplied black market coal, said that most of the black market coal was provided by the shipping company's remaining coal stack list and had nothing to do with the Fuel Management Committee. Sun Jice argued that the coal distribution to the shipping company was based on the following standards: (1) Jianghai ships, according to their voyage and tonnage, were allocated more than 28,000 tons per month, including the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company; (2) Inland river ships, about dozens of companies, were allocated more than 1,000 tons per month; (3) Tugboats and barges, about a dozen companies, were allocated hundreds of tons per month. The shipping company managed by He Zhiying and others was handled according to the old case. After the application for investigation, the verification and distribution were carried out, and there was no over-distribution, first 475 tons, and later changed to 375 tons, and he did not admit to sharing the difference between the market price and the black market price. Han Chengpu testified that He Zhiying and Jian Ping and others had sent bribes, but he knew but did not know the details. Sun Zhigang, a clerk of Jiangzhe Shipping Company, admitted that he had been ordered to purchase gifts, foreign wine, and cigarettes for Sun and Lin during the Chinese New Year's Eve and Dragon Boat Festival last year, but he denied sending bribes. Finally, Shen Jinfu of Shenjiang Shipping Bureau, Cheng Yuguang of Detai, Yan Azhang of Yuanfu, Shen Tieyin of Puyi, and Li Huaqing of Huada were interrogated, and they all testified about the situation of the shipping company entrusting Han Chengpu to resell the remaining coal on the black market. The court ordered a retrial because there were still some important witnesses who could not attend, and the defendants were returned to prison. The court adjourned at about 6 p.m.</p>
<h3>To Solve the Coal Shortage of Public Utilities, Please Establish a Sound Allocation Mechanism</h3>
<p>[Our newspaper's report] According to the Public Utilities Bureau, the Municipal Tobacco Coal Adjustment and Supply Office has drafted a new adjustment allocation price calculation method at the request of miners, and submitted it to the Central Committee for approval before implementation. In order to solve the coal shortage, the Public Utilities Bureau recently convened the persons in charge of public utility companies to discuss solutions. It is planned that each company will directly order from the miners, but the company finds that transportation is difficult and a specialized institution is needed to be responsible for handling the matter. Therefore, it was decided to telegraph the Central Committee to immediately establish a sound allocation mechanism, and set up coal yards for contingency needs.</p>
<h3>Supplementary Measures to Stabilize the Value of the Gold Yuan, Continued from Page Two</h3>
<p>(2) The government should immediately formulate and announce a concrete fiscal plan to balance revenue and expenditure, in order to eliminate the people's doubts about the expansion of the new currency.</p>
<p>(Explanation) If the people still have the terror of continued expansion of the gold yuan, the currency value cannot be maintained. If there is no way to balance fiscal revenue and expenditure, the terror cannot be eliminated. According to the reports of the financial officers in charge, the military and political expenditures from July to the end of this year (the numbers have been reported by the Minister of Finance in the first secret meeting of this session) are less than the US aid. At best, the financial burden is only a special wartime expenditure. However, since January, Hong Kong telegraphic transfers have been heard to have a black market, and prices have also fluctuated in various parts of the country. Although the government has used strong controls, the issue of high or low prices has become a matter of the quantity of materials. If no measures are taken to improve the situation, it may become a matter of whether or not there are materials. The biggest reason is that the fiscal balance of revenue and expenditure has not been made known to the public, and the public's terror of issuing expansion has not been eliminated. The short-term finances can be easily balanced by US aid, and it can be clearly announced that the revenue and expenditure have been balanced and that there are reasonable plans for the future, so that the whole country knows that the currency credit is easy to establish and the currency value is stable, which should not be difficult.</p>
<p>(3) The issuance reserve fund and the gold, silver, and foreign currencies collected after August 19 should all be concentrated for planned use, to control the materials necessary for people's livelihood, sell them in different regions to maintain production, supply civil use, stabilize prices, and consolidate the currency value. (Explanation) Since the gold yuan is a managed currency, its currency value and credit are not expressed by the reserves of gold, silver, and foreign exchange in the idle vaults, but by whether or not it can purchase the required goods at stable prices for a long time. If it can be done, even if there is no reserve, the people will regard this currency as a treasure and trust it with peace of mind. If it cannot be done, even if there are sufficient gold, silver, and foreign exchange reserves for issuance in the vault, the people will definitely think that it has nothing to do with the currency value and currency credit. This is very simple and does not need to be repeated. According to the customs statistics before the war, the total value of imported materials each year was 300 million US dollars. With the current depreciation of the US dollar at less than 50%, and the types of goods we need are more than before, our currency value should start from the areas that have not been lost, and the control of materials should be limited to daily necessities. It is estimated that the annual requirement should not be more than 300 million US dollars. If the existing US aid materials are not reordered, the purchase price of those that need to be ordered within one year must be far below 300 million US dollars. If the government instructs the Central Bank and the Issuance Supervisory Committee to use the reserve fund to order raw materials or finished products of daily necessities abroad, together with US aid, they will be sold by Tianjin, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Hankou, Dianqing, Kunming and other ports to Gudi factories and counties and cities. Then, a standard retail price will be set for each region. This control has something to manage, not just people. The prices of imported goods and factory products will no longer fluctuate, and the currency value will be stabilized. Then, the Central Bank will use the gold yuan obtained from the sale to purchase export goods and encourage exporters to work together. The foreign exchange obtained from the export goods will be used to order import goods, then the prices in various places can be stabilized for a long time, and the currency value will be consolidated. At the same time, because the prices are stable, the export goods will definitely increase sharply. It is deeply believed that the foreign exchange that the country can control will also increase, which will greatly help the currency value and currency credit. Stop issuing five-cent silver coins, and all corner coins below one yuan are made of nickel, and the corner coins below one corner are made of copper.</p>
<p>(Explanation) The previous article has explained that the maintenance of the currency value and currency credit of the gold yuan is not in the existence of the reserve fund. According to this, it is not in whether the coins are made of gold and silver. It is even more impossible to be superstitious that the silver coins are redeemed, which is always a tool for stabilizing the currency value. Now that gold, silver, and foreign exchange are owned by the state, if they are redeemed again, whether they are gold, silver, or foreign exchange, they will conflict with the statement of state-owned. If the people's view of valuing gold and silver and despising paper money cannot be completely changed by the method of stabilizing prices with abundant materials, then no matter how many silver coins there are, they will definitely be quickly redeemed. How can the country have such a large amount of silver for coping? Once redeemed, what will be done to deal with the aftermath? Moreover, the silver content of the current silver coins has been reduced to several tenths of that contained in the original silver dollar, which is tantamount to telling the whole country that today's gold yuan can only be equal to several tenths of a silver dollar. The treatment of officials and soldiers is already disappointing according to the calculations before the war, and it is even more criticized for the discount payment before the war. Those who want to stabilize the currency value with silver will actually accelerate its devaluation. This kind of silver coin method, which contradicts the state-owned policy of silver and devalues the currency, is absolutely unfeasible.</p>
<p>(B) Regarding Increase in Producers</p>
<p>(1) Stipulate the method of offsetting capital by converting all assets of production businesses before the change of system into gold yuan.</p>
<p>(Explanation) Before the war, the capital of production businesses was more than 10 million for large businesses and tens of thousands for small businesses. Since the Anti-Japanese War, the currency value has gradually declined, and the funds of production businesses have gradually increased, but most of them are tens of millions of legal currencies, as many as hundreds of millions, and only a very few are calculated in hundreds of billions. The fixed assets of production businesses account for a large amount of funds, and their current assets have long since disappeared due to the depreciation of currency over the years. When borrowing current assets before the change of system, state-owned banks and commercial banks often refused to borrow due to insufficient capital or too much debt. If the capital of the current production business before the change of system is 1 billion legal currencies (in fact, very few reach this number), the combined gold yuan is only more than 300 yuan, which is not enough to be a business, and it is impossible to be fair to the original investors, and it is even more difficult to collect new capital. It is planned to reasonably convert the fixed assets before the change of system into gold yuan as its existing capital, and then order it to raise a part of the cash as current assets, so that all production businesses have the possibility of continuing to operate.</p>
<p>(2) The government should formulate various methods related to advocating and maintaining production businesses to develop production, improve people's livelihood, and cultivate tax sources.</p>
<p>(Explanation) The growth of various production businesses will naturally benefit the finances in the end, but before they grow, they must first be helped and advocated to promote their success. They must not affect the survival of the business because of the pursuit of temporary financial benefits (and sometimes it does not prevent a little expenditure). Therefore, it is a fundamental plan to formulate methods to advocate and maintain production businesses during the change of system. The principles are: 1. Stipulate the financial financing methods of production businesses; 2. Stipulate the methods for the government to train and reserve technical personnel of production businesses; 3. Stipulate the methods for production businesses to guarantee capital and interest; 4. Stipulate the tax exemption and reduction methods for production businesses when expanding. In short, the government's reform of the currency system this time was planned in advance to be strict and rapid, so the measures are inevitably flawed, which is understandable. In the future, how to supplement and complete them to make the currency value and currency credit more consolidated, so as to maintain the interests of the entire nation, the comrades of this party have a duty to fulfill. Therefore, the above-mentioned supplementary methods are proposed based on the understanding of the foolishness. Whether they are appropriate, we respectfully await the public decision.</p>

<h3>Qingdao from a National Perspective</h3>
<p>— Our Special Correspondent Shao Shenzhi</p>
<p>[Our Qingdao Dispatch, 8th] In the current situation, this question has been urgently raised by people in Beijing, Shanghai, and the South who are concerned about the current situation. Its implications are quite complex, but broadly speaking, it can be divided into two aspects: one military and one economic, and involving international issues.</p>
<p>Having returned to Qingdao, I have made many observations, but there seems to be little that can be discussed. The Battle of Jinan directly affects the overall situation, but does not directly affect Qingdao. What can affect Qingdao is the overall situation, not Jinan. To say that people are calm is true. Extremely calm, observing the overall situation in calmness. To say that people are not calm refers to the economy. The black market is active, and the scale of its transactions is truly shocking to people in the South.</p>
<p>Smuggled Goods Occasionally Seized</p>
<p>As the war has evolved from battles of attrition to coordinated large-scale positional and logistical warfare, the consumption of supplies is also large-scale. Qingdao, like Yantai, occasionally seizes smuggled goods, mostly oil, surgical supplies, sulfur, nitrate, and raw materials for steelmaking, and even munitions. Qingdao plays a significant role in the smuggling of supplies. (On the other hand, American goods on which no taxes have been paid are appearing on the market, and some merchants are waiting for the arrival of a special fleet.) Political methods cannot escape economic principles. Wherever high prices prevail, supplies will flow, and this is a serious reality.</p>
<p>A large number of Chinese staff members in the U.S. military whose backgrounds are unclear have been dismissed in the past two weeks, and are on standby to be notified. From a purely military point of view, the usefulness of the Qingdao naval base can be assessed, but if the maintenance of the status quo in Qingdao is related to the U.S. military's ships and marines, this purely military assessment is clearly unreliable. If U.S. policy does not allow the use of national force against the rebel army of another country, and military strategy cannot keep up with political strategy, then the future situation will be difficult to predict, but it can be broadly assessed. The size of the Pacific Fleet or the special fleet that may be deployed is the same, and not particularly alarming. Its existing four hundred vehicles are sufficient to assist in the evacuation of all land personnel and expatriates within hours.</p>
<p>People from Jinan Talk About the "Jinan Battle"</p>
<p>A certain division of the New Army arrived here from Taiwan the day before yesterday and landed. The two divisions originally stationed here will also be newly equipped. Based on impressions gained from conversations with people from Jinan, the scale of the Battle of Jinan was only one-tenth of that of Weixian, and only a few buildings were destroyed. People from Shandong often express their grievances: the local militia's service is the same as that of the National Army, but the treatment is very different. The Japanese government stipulates that local militias who have rendered meritorious service in combat can be promoted to the National Army, which seems to encourage local militias on the surface, but is actually tantamount to wanting them to forever remain "hanging around." The local militias are unwilling to leave their homes and land, so the Battle of Weixian is a typical example. It is hoped that the central government will pay attention to Qingdao.</p>
<h3>Starving Deaths in September, Relief Unknown in October: Gong Xuesui Reprimanded</h3>
<p>Residents of the peninsula are more concerned with the price and availability of flour than with the merits and demerits of such issues. Mayor Gong Xuesui once became the target of public criticism because, after price controls were implemented, the city could not obtain food, citizens went hungry, and cries of distress were heard everywhere, while public and private grain reserves in warehouses totaled no less than a million bags. The allocation was delayed for a month, and the inspection of warehouses was more bark than bite. The authorities vowed that they would definitely not sell to wealthy families or military capital, and this was also promoted for a month. After starving, the anger erupted, during which the authorities suddenly sold 5,000 bags to the market, creating a buying frenzy, which fell into the hands of black market grain dealers. Dagu Road was crowded with people, some suffering head injuries and bloodshed. Gong Xuesui then allocated 300 bags of flour to the Huaxin Yarn Factory for sizing purposes, creating further controversy, and the public uproar was loud. A group of senators prepared to confront Gong Xuesui, but Gong was clever, admitting his absurdity and saying that it was because he was too busy and made a mistake, and agreed with all kinds of opinions, both positive and negative, leaving the group of senators both amused and frustrated. It turned into a bureaucratic interlude.</p>
<p>But the problem has not been resolved. Mr. O'Auer, representative of the Qingdao office of the ECA China Division, also raised a series of questions to Gong, arguing that the allocation for September should not be delayed until October, saying, "People who starved to death in September cannot be saved in October." Forty percent of the 360,000 bags of flour allocated in Qingdao came from the ECA, and the owner was very serious, so some awkward situations arose.</p>
<p>Situation of "Counting Rice for Cooking"</p>
<p>Furthermore, the allocation is only 15 catties per person per month, which is definitely not enough to eat, and the remaining grain must be sought on the scary black market. These two days, warehouses are being inspected, and over 400,000 bags have been found. It is said that they will be sold at the controlled price to compensate for the insufficient 15-catty allocation, but whether they will be sold by stores or allocated by the Residents' Survey Committee is still under consideration. However, these flour can only supply one month's needs, and problems will arise next month. Grain merchants usually regard September and October as peak seasons for purchasing to prepare for the winter, but this year they have hesitated to move forward unless the government can guarantee their profits. Whether it is possible to purchase at the controlled price in the South is also a problem. The black market price of rice is five times higher than in Shanghai, truly reaching the point of counting rice for cooking.</p>
<p>1,500 tons of rice are going to fly to the Northeast. The situation is gradually shifting south, and grain from Shenyang is to be transported from Qingdao, a flight of just over two hours, passing over the Bohai Strait and the skies of Dalian and Lushun. It will take more than a month to transport 1,500 tons of rice. A few CAT planes shuttle back and forth, which is like child's play compared to the Berlin airlift, so the news of Soviet planes demonstrating is nothing more than that.</p>
<p>Military and political requirements are contradictory, whether to stay away or get closer, but what is the guiding principle? This is a terrible question.</p>
<h3>Tang Jishan, Husband of Deceased Movie Star Ruan Lingyu, Remarries in Beiping</h3>

<h3>Opening of the Shuijiahe-Hefei Section of the Huainan Railway</h3>
<p>— Our Reporter Bao Baiping</p>
<p>[Our Hefei Dispatch, 11th] While the Jianghuai Plain is enjoying the autumn harvest and banditry is rampant on the edge of Anhui, the 70-kilometer Shuijiahe-Hefei section of the Huainan Railway has officially reopened. This marks the completion of the first phase of the railway's main line restoration project. It is good news for Hefei, which becomes an isolated city in rainy weather, and also marks the beginning of rapid coal transportation to support the power of the upper and lower reaches of the Yangtze River.</p>
<p>Speaking of the Huainan Railway, one cannot help but feel a sense of vicissitudes. It starts from Tianjiaan on the south bank of the Huai River, passes through the Datong and Jiulonggang mining areas, as well as Shuijiahe, Hefei, Chaoxian, and reaches Yuxi, which belongs to He County, opposite Wuhu, for a total length of 214 kilometers. During the pre-war survey of the Huainan mining area, it was determined that the coal produced there had to be transported by the Huai River waterway to Bengbu, and then transferred by the Jinpu Railway to Pukou, which was slow and costly. Therefore, the Huainan Railway was built to connect Jianghuai, facilitate coal transportation, and develop transportation in northern and central Anhui, and connect southern Anhui. Surveying began in the winter of the 22nd year of the Republic, the entire line was completed at the end of the 24th year, and it officially opened to traffic in January of the 25th year. The following year, the War of Resistance began, and the road was first destroyed by the "scorched earth" policy, and then dismantled by the Japanese. After the victory, only the bare roadbed remained. Now, the restoration, except for the roadbed not needing to be rebuilt, is the same as building a new one.</p>
<p>During the Japanese occupation, the Huainan mine was dug up in a mess. After the takeover, the Mineral Railway Company devoted most of its efforts to reorganizing the coal mine. In addition, steel rails, sleepers, and wagons all required money, and all became problems because the company had no money. The road was thus put on hold in everyone's anxious anticipation. The section from Shuijiahe to Bengbu, 60 kilometers, was originally built by the Japanese by dismantling the main line from Shuijiahe to Yuxi during the occupation. It was then severely damaged by bandits after the victory. Director Wu Jingqing of the Railway Bureau reported at the Double Tenth Festival opening ceremony of the Shuijiahe-Hefei section that in November of the 34th year, they only took over 27 kilometers of railway from Tianjiaan to Shuijiahe from the Japanese, three dilapidated stations, an unfinished machine shop, and 300 dilapidated vehicles. In addition, he only brought a national flag and two or three takeover personnel. Under such circumstances, he became the director of the Huainan Railway Bureau. At that time, there were countless tasks and countless problems. However, coal transportation, military transportation, and cargo transportation all required roads, so they began to repair the Shuijiahe-Bengbu section, which started construction in the spring of the 35th year and opened to traffic on June 1st. However, due to the Japanese' hasty construction, the roadbed and bridge culvert engineering were substandard, and driving was dangerous, making it impossible to make full use of it. In the winter of the same year, when the water was low, a plan was made to improve it, adding revetments, adding ballast, and strengthening the bridge revetments and fortifications. This is how the road between Shuijiahe and Bengbu was improved and no longer made people worry all day long. Although coal was transported to Bengbu and transferred to the Jinpu Railway for distribution to the north and south, the mineral railway itself suffered deep depression. It is said that the freight paid to the Jinpu Railway for transporting coal to Pukou was quite expensive, and the coordination of wagon scheduling with the Jinpu Railway's driving time also resulted in irreparable waste. Furthermore, it took three days for a wagon to complete a round trip from the mine to Pukou, while it took only twelve hours on the Shuijiahe-Yuxi section, resulting in an efficiency ratio of six to one. These many problems plagued the Mining Bureau and made them feel very aggrieved. Therefore, the restoration of the Shuijiahe-Yuxi section was an extremely urgent need for them, and needless to say for transportation between Jianghuai.</p>
<p>This year, on the Double Tenth Festival, black smoke filled the clear sky outside Hefei East. Locomotive No. 109 pulled first, second, and third-class passenger cars and came like a long reptile. For a full eleven years, this serious and far-reaching monster reappeared in the eyes of the people of Hefei. Everyone who heard the whistle was equally excited and happy. The train they had been looking forward to had finally arrived!</p>
<p>The damage to the roadbed and bridges on the Shuijiahe-Hefei section was even worse than that on the Hefei-Yuxi section. Before the restoration, preliminary surveying and mapping work was completed in the spring of the 35th year, followed by a review in December of the following year, averaging three kilometers of measurement per day, and completed on January 24th of this year. Immediately after, bridge repairs began, which was equivalent to two projects, because Shuijiahe-Hefei traffic had been maintained by cars on the railway base since the victory until recently. The bridge repair still did not interrupt traffic. Every time a bridge was repaired, a temporary bridge had to be built next to it to allow cars to pass. There were a total of six large bridges in this section, with a length of 221.986 meters, and eleven small bridges, with a length of 53.845 meters. In order to facilitate irrigation for the farmland on both sides, 37 culverts were added. The bridge work was not completed until July of this year. In addition, due to the long-term use of cars on the roadbed, which had not been repaired, the ballast penetrated deep into the roadbed, the road surface was uneven, and the side slopes had collapsed. The renovation and sorting began on July 22nd.</p>
<p>All projects were designed according to the Middle China Republic railway construction standards and regulations established by the Jiangneng Ministry. The roadbed was handled according to the Class B railway regulations of the standard, with a minimum radius of curvature of four degrees, a maximum slope of one percent, a straight embankment width of five meters, and a cut width of 4.5 meters. The track used 37 kg new rails, and the track gauge was the standard gauge of 1435 mm. The sleepers used 200 × 150 × 2440 American pine sleepers, with 1680 sleepers laid per kilometer on the main line. The steel rails were generally staggered on the main line, and flat joints were used in the station. The important turnouts in the station were all No. 10, and the secondary turnout lines used No. 8 turnouts. The effective length of the station tracks was set at 460 meters, and the center spacing between the tracks was mostly 4.5 meters. The ballast thickness was 0.15 meters below the sleeper surface. Under such design standards, the track laying project began on July 20th.</p>
<p>In the hot summer sun, the mercury column on the thermometer often fluctuated between 100 degrees Fahrenheit. In order to repair this section of the road, more than 400 employees were sweating all day long, and sometimes they were injured and bled. Every small stone, every steel rail, every sleeper, and every fifth electric pole had been touched by their sweaty and bloody hands. Not counting washing off blood and sweat, sometimes diseases would attack them, but they forged ahead without slackening, and arranged 5,580 metric tons of steel rails, 131,000 sleepers, 166 metric tons of track spikes, 32 metric tons of screws, 13,300 fishplates, 33 turnouts, and 1,420 electric poles in their respective positions on the 70-kilometer roadbed. Only then was the task completed. At noon on September 22nd, these railway heroes, who advanced one and a half kilometers every day, arrived at the Hefei Station central line, six hours ahead of schedule.</p>
<p>During the opening ceremony, Director Wu recounted the construction process in detail, and specially pointed out the names of the personnel who participated in the track laying project. He named a total of 15 people, including Chief Engineer and Director of the Engineering Department Li Jinghui, Deputy Director and Chief of the Engineering Section Wu Yan, Chief Engineer Lu Fengshan, Liu Xinmin, Deputy Engineer Wang Yongmin, Assistant Engineers Zhang Haoqing, Tang Taotong, Ao Rixin, Shao Kejian, Liu Bozhi, Chai Lantian, Zheng Chongci, Deputy Director of the Transportation Department Liu JIng, Deputy Director of the Shuijiahe-Hefei Transportation Section Han Zuoxin, and Transportation Inspector He Xian Guang. When these railway heroes appeared in front of the podium in response to their names, their faces were all tanned by the sun, showing the hard work of track laying. Director Wu said to them with a smile, "You are the most hardworking track layers. In the future, every passenger sitting in the train will definitely commemorate you!" Director Wu gave each of them a certificate of appreciation, which should be the price and comfort of their hard work. This is glorious!</p>
<p>The future goal is to repair the second phase of the project, the 68-kilometer Hefei-Chaoxian section. Although there are enough steel rails and sleepers, it is not yet known when it will be open to traffic because of the lack of funds. Cheng Wenxun, general manager of the Mining Railway Company, came from Shanghai to participate in the ceremony. According to him, the company's financial situation and the future of the road are not smooth. The Canadian US$15 million loan was tight for a while and then loose, but it was finally successful. Now, the payment of interest, repayment of principal, road restoration costs, and employee salaries are making the company feel like it is Chinese New Year's Eve every day. National railways still have government subsidies, but the coal price and ticket price of the Huainan Mining Company are also restricted. The main reason why the main line cannot be completed on weekdays is the lack of funds.</p>
<p>This Jianghuai bridge is the military, political, economic, and cultural artery of Anhui. We wish the Hefei-Yuxi project a smooth progress and hope that the railway will be restored on weekdays. We look forward to black smoke shooting into the sky everywhere on the Jianghuai Plain.</p>
<h3>Viewing Platform to Be Built on Chenghuang Mountain in Hangzhou</h3>
<p>[Our Hangzhou Dispatch, 13th] It has been decided to rebuild the viewing platform on Chenghuang Mountain in Hangzhou. The cost is 7,000 gold yuan, and Chairman Chen has approved the construction.</p>
<h3>Coal Car Accident on the Lan-A Coal Road</h3>
<p>— Fourteen Deaths and Injuries</p>
<p>[Our Lanzhou Dispatch, 11th] An unprecedented overturning accident occurred on the Lan-A Coal Road on the 9th, with 14 passengers injured or killed. In addition to three deaths at the Hanchang site, one died en route to the hospital, and another is in critical condition. A B.T.A. No. 7 small jeep of the Chinese Industrial Cooperatives Association was hired by Sun Daming, manager of the Jianhua Hosiery Factory in this city, to transport coal to Agan Town on the morning of the 9th. At about 10:00 am, it returned from the mining area. In addition to being fully loaded with coal, there were more than a dozen passengers. When it arrived at the Dashuizi section about five miles south of Agan Town, it happened to meet another truck coming from the north. When the two vehicles yielded to each other, the trade union vehicle drove to the side of the road. Unexpectedly, the roadbed was eroded by river water, and the soil was loose and soft. The vehicle overturned and fell to the riverside, with the four wheels facing the sky. The passengers were covered by coal and the vehicle body, resulting in 14 injuries and deaths. After the accident, the driver, Gao Yonglin, took the opportunity to escape. Several other passengers who were not seriously injured also left on their own. It was not until noon that the Agan Town Police Station discovered the accident and sent personnel to handle the aftermath. After investigation, it was found that there were seven seriously injured, four slightly injured, and three dead. The injured were taken to Agan Town Hospital for treatment, and one died en route. The driver of the accident was also apprehended in Agan Town and escorted to the Gaolan County Police Bureau. After interrogation on the 10th, the local procuratorate was notified to examine the corpses and bury them. The driver of the accident and the employer Sun Daming were transferred to the procuratorate on the 11th for interrogation. According to the person in charge of the trade union, the vehicle belonged to the Shandan Peili School. It recently came to Lanzhou from Shandan and was going to Chongqing to pick up equipment. The trade union and the school authorities were unaware of the vehicle going to Agan Town to transport coal. In order to understand the accident situation and handle the casualties, Guo Songmao, director of the trade union, rushed to Agan Town today.</p>
<h3>Dissatisfied with Airplane Ticket and Yarn Prices, Lanzhou Citizen Reports It: China Aviation Corporation Sends Letter to Special Criminal Court in Response</h3>
<p>[Our Lanzhou Dispatch, 7th] Since the currency reform in Lanzhou, there have been quite a few merchants and citizens who have been reported or sent to the Special Criminal Court for violating economic control measures. On the 15th of last month, citizen Li Qianrang reported to the Lanzhou Higher Special Criminal Court that the ticket prices of Central and China Airlines had increased after "8/19" and requested a trial by law. The Special Criminal Court then informed the Lanzhou office of the two airlines to respond. The Lanzhou office of China Aviation Corporation copied the response to the head office, and the response letter was sent to Lanzhou a few days ago and submitted to the Special Criminal Court. These two documents are meaningful and interesting letters after the currency reform in Lanzhou. We will explore and record them below:</p>
<p>Special Criminal Court Letter to China Aviation Corporation</p>
<p>"According to the report submitted by citizen Li Qianrang on September 15th of this year: Regarding the increase in ticket prices of Central and China Airlines (according to the companies, the ticket prices were increased by 85% on August 20th, as evidenced by various newspapers), your court should have heard about it. It seems that your court cannot sit idly by and not intervene in such a case of disrupting laws and disrupting finances. It is hoped that you will quickly report and punish according to law in order to maintain the national law. After investigation, the various points mentioned by the citizen are not without cause, and this court has a strong need to understand them. You are hereby requested to investigate and respond within three days of the receipt of this letter! To: Lanzhou Office of China Aviation Corporation. Court President Meng Zhaodong, Chief Prosecutor Peng Junzhi. September 22nd."</p>
<p>Response from China Aviation Corporation</p>
<p>"Regarding the letter from the Lanzhou Office of our company on September 23rd, copying the letter No. 78 from your court on September 22nd, stating that the current ticket price of our company has increased by 85% compared to "8/19," requesting a response, etc., our company's freight and passenger fares were approved for adjustment on August 4th. Due to the sharp rise in oil prices and the steep increase in flight costs, we jointly submitted a request to the Ministry of Transportation with Central Aviation Corporation on August 16th to re-approve the fare so as to maintain it. On August 18th, we received an order from the Ministry, approving an increase of 85% in accordance with the fare on August 4th. Our company immediately notified all stations on the same day to sell tickets at the new price from the 19th. The fare was approved and implemented before "8/19" and does not conflict with the management principles. In order to support the government's policy of stabilizing commodity prices, our company, at the cost of great sacrifice, has voluntarily suppressed the freight and mail rates to the original price on August 4th from August 27th, so as not to affect the cost of commercial goods. The above is the detailed process of our company's fare adjustment. The outside world may not understand it, leading to misunderstandings. We hereby list the whole story and request your investigation! To: Lanzhou Higher Special Criminal Court. China Aviation Corporation, September 30th."</p>
<h3>Western Wind Intensifies, Northern Geese Fly South: Bian City in State of War-Induced Tremors</h3>
<p>— Our Reporter Wang Shoumei</p>
<p>[Our Dispatch from Kaifeng, 8th] It is precisely the time when osmanthus flowers fill the air with fragrance, but Kaifeng has spent half a month in a sorrowful state amidst chilling winds and bitter rain. While over 200,000 citizens struggle to survive in darkness, dampness, mud, and rot, everyone curses the annoying patter of rain, raising their heads to ask the heavens, "Will there never be a sunny day?" As long as the sky clears, the warmth of the autumn sun will return to the world. Food and firewood from the countryside will flow in steadily, and all newborn hope will shine again in the hearts of these over 200,000 citizens. Everyone is waiting with unbearable anticipation.</p>
<p>The sky finally cleared, clearing so beautifully that there wasn't a single cloud in the azure sky. The tender and warm sunlight shone gently on the autumn fields and city, just like in previous years. But unfortunately, this clear weather did not bring warmth to the people, nor did it bring them new life and hope. Food and firewood from the countryside did not flow in steadily as everyone had imagined. Oil, salt, and vegetables could not be bought in the market. This place remains a city of hunger. The heavy and melancholic mood of the people has not been melted by the lonely sunshine. On the contrary, because the western wind is intensifying and the northern geese are flying south, the threat of the season and the current situation has caused everyone to begin another round of trembling.</p>
<p>Although the weather after the clearing is indeed crisp and refreshing in autumn, the scattered flowers and fallen leaves, the desolate atmosphere, are just like the terror of war, spreading throughout this city of fear.</p>
<p>These past few days, the streets have been filled with rickshaws carrying luggage concentrated towards the station. The station is bustling and overcrowded, making it difficult to move. Many people, fearing they won't be able to catch the train, load their wives, children, and luggage onto the open cars without canopies the day before, waiting in the deep cold dew, crying from hunger and cold, for the train to depart at dawn. When dawn breaks, the people who arrive later scramble onto the train, piling people on top of people and goods on top of goods. A broken locomotive pulls over thirty cars, each section resembling Mount Tai and the Big Dipper. People are on the smokestack of the engine, people are on the hooks, people are on the footboards, and people are hanging outside the carriages. The train moves as slowly as an ox. These northern geese, flying south because of the intensified rumors, will have to endure being blown by the wind and soaked by the dew for three to five days and nights before they can reach Jiangnan. But they are not afraid of such suffering and hardship. In reality, there is not a single sign of trouble around Kaifeng. The main force of the Liu bandits is still being blocked by the powerful National Army in the area west of the Pinghan Railway, including Xiang, Jia, Ye, Fang, and Wu. The main force of the Chen bandits, after capturing Jinan, is still stationed around Yingzhong without making any moves. Except for a small number of local communists who are being wiped out by the National Army, there are no bandit troops worth worrying about in the eastern Henan and Si areas. Moreover, Kaifeng is guarded by the famous iron army generals Liu Ruming and Liu Ruzhen, yet it is actually in a state of turmoil and unease. People are generally rumored that Zheng and Bian will be sacrificed for Xuzhou when necessary. This rumor is like a wind blowing through an empty valley, but no one is stopping its spread. The speed at which this rumor is spreading is accelerating. Today, all the newspapers in the city published a message from the Yellow River News Agency saying: "According to relevant sources from the Longhai Railway Bureau, the bureau has received an order from the Ministry of Communications that the Zhejiang-Jiangxi and Beijing-Shanghai railways urgently need a large number of passenger and freight vehicles. For the convenience of passenger and freight transportation, the bureau will soon transfer more than 200 red express freight cars (numbers 303 and 304) and more than 20 ordinary passenger cars to Jiangnan, and some officials will also go with the cars to provide services." As a result, people are even more uneasy. Everyone is worried that there will still be open cars to ride. If they delay any longer, they fear that even open cars will be gone, and they won't be able to leave even if they want to.</p>
<p>Here, the rain has stopped, but the azure sky, yellow flowers, and autumn scenery cannot captivate people because the western wind is intensifying, and the northern geese are making preparations to fly south.</p>
<h3>Large Oilfield Discovered in Longquan Mountain Area, Western Sichuan</h3>
<p>— Our Reporter Zhou Xueduan</p>
<p>[Our Dispatch from Chengdu, 11th] Sichuan is known as the "Land of Abundance," but although it has abundant reserves of petroleum, a national defense resource, no major discoveries have been made until now. Recently, after several years of investigation by the Resources Commission, an unprecedented large oilfield has been discovered in the Longquan Mountain area, 50 li from Chengdu, the gateway to western Sichuan. The oil quality is excellent, and the reserves are abundant. In terms of national defense value, it far surpasses the Yumen Oilfield in Gansu. This is truly the most gratifying stimulant amidst the active construction of the Great Southwest.</p>
<p>Oilfield Area</p>
<p>Longquan Mountain is located 50 li east of Chengdu. It is undulating and continuous, with dangerous and magnificent terrain. It is a strategic location for military strategists and a must-defend. It has always been the gateway to western Sichuan and the throat of Chengdu. In order to explore the discovery of this treasure, the reporter once visited and inspected the Laojun Pavilion on the summit of Longquan. According to He Diansheng, a geologist from the Resources Commission who presided over the survey: This is the top of the great anticline layer in western Sichuan. From here, it descends northward, passing through Jianyang, Jingtang Zhaojia Ferry, crossing the Tuojiang River, and reaching Zhongjiang Shiquanchang. To the south, it extends to Renshou Fenshuipu, with a total length of 120 kilometers. The oil deposits are mostly in the Jialingjiang limestone layer, in the shape of lentils, with a thickness of 30 to 40 meters in some places. The entire great anticline layer extends from northeast to southwest. There are also a few small synclinal and anticlinal layers on the east and west sides. In the past, the petroleum discovered in Sichuan was only in these few small anticlinal layers. This discovery of the great anticline layer shows that Sichuan does indeed have the most abundant petroleum resources.</p>
<p>Discovery Process</p>
<p>This discovery dates back to 1945 when geologist Xie Jiarong once conducted a survey of a section of Longquan Mountain and determined that it was the most ideal oil storage structure. Last winter, British geologist Martins Strante came to investigate the area and confirmed that it had extremely exploitable value. After returning to Beijing, he immediately suggested to the Resources Commission to conduct preliminary exploration. Chairman Weng Wenhao actively agreed and sent He Diansheng and others to Sichuan for detailed investigation and survey. After several months of work, it was discovered that the cross-section of this great anticline layer is a fan-shaped structure that has been strongly folded. A large amount of "natural gas" escapes from the fissures at the top. In the surface layers of Laochanggou and Guojiagou, various rock layers contain salt essence. Based on the principle of symbiosis of petroleum, natural gas, and salt, it is judged that the petroleum area of this great anticline layer is about 1,500 square kilometers. The reserves of petroleum and natural gas are about ten times that of Zigong, and the salt reserves may also be ten times that of the Ziliujing well area.</p>
<p>Exploration Plan</p>
<p>According to the opinions of the geologists in charge of the survey: The Yumen Oilfield in Gansu belongs to the Tertiary oil-producing area. The reserves are not very abundant, and transportation is extremely inconvenient. The Mineral Exploration Department of the Resources Commission has long been planning to explore and develop petroleum mines in Sichuan Province. Discoveries have been made in Jiangyou, Longchang, and Ziliujing, but the quality is not ideal because this area is mostly close to metamorphic rocks. Recently, the Sichuan Factory of Bingli Chemical Company discovered crude oil in a new stratum at a depth of 3,500 feet in a deep well drilled in Wutongqiao, but after analysis, the oil quality is also not very good. Only the new oil mine in the Longquan Mountain area may not only have the best quality in the Southwest but is also no less than any famous large oilfield in the country. This great discovery proves that Sichuan will have an unprecedented supply of national defense resources in the future and deserves to be called the "Land of Abundance." Now, the Resources Commission has decided to devote all its efforts to development. It plans to immediately start large-scale drilling projects, with a minimum depth of 2,000 meters below the Jialingjiang limestone layer, to find the oil-gas interface and then formally start mining. The people of Sichuan are now waiting with the most eager expectation for the implementation of this great project.</p>

<h3>Central Bank Decides on Five Measures to Strengthen the Collection of Gold, Silver, and Foreign Currencies: Remote Rural Areas Can Use Communication Reporting Methods</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] Since the government announced the extension of the deadline for the collection of gold, silver, and foreign currencies, the Central Bank, in order to strengthen the collection, in addition to entrusting state-owned banks and provincial banks in various places without branches to act as agents, recently invited responsible persons from state-owned banks and provincial banks to discuss technical issues. It has been decided that: (1) The provincial and municipal governments are requested to instruct the county governments to go down to the pao-chia (neighborhood) level to expand publicity and persuade the people to exchange as soon as possible within the deadline. (2) Remote rural areas where exchange is inconvenient can use communication reporting methods. The entrusted banks in various places can accept them and should provide a quick and concise response to facilitate delivery. (3) Communication reporting should be carried out in coordination with mobile collection, but mobile collection should only be carried out when necessary. (4) After the entrusted banks exchange gold, silver, and foreign currencies, they can immediately submit them to the nearest branch of the Central Bank, which will issue a certificate to facilitate submission. The Central Bank will also negotiate with the Ministry of Finance to apply for passports to expedite the process. (5) The gold, silver, and foreign currencies exchanged in various places should first be collected by the branches of the Central Bank and then remitted to the head office.</p>
<p>[Our Dispatch] From August 23 to October 9, the total amount of gold, silver, and foreign currencies collected by the Central Bank and its entrusted banks in this city is as follows: (1) Gold: 1,144,714 taels, 9 mace, 0 candareens, and 7 cash; (2) Silver: 963,128 taels, 2 fen, and 6 li; (3) Silver dollars: 3,668,473 yuan and 5 jiao; (4) Silver dimes: 3,847,860 coins (double dimes); (5) US dollars: 34,438,872 yuan, 8 jiao, and 9 fen; (6) Hong Kong dollars: 10,345,753 yuan, 1 jiao, and 7 fen; (7) Philippine pesos: 14,364 pesos, 1 jiao, and 5 centavos.</p>
<h3>Yarn Merchants Request Permission to Retain Inventory as They Are Temporarily Unwilling to Resell: Very Few Yarn Thrown by the China Textile Corporation Yesterday</h3>
<p>After holding a meeting of directors and supervisors the day before yesterday afternoon, Tang Zhiliang, chairman of the Cotton Yarn Business Association, yesterday presented two points of opinion to the Supervisory Office: (1) Regarding the previous notification from the Bureau of Social Affairs to yarn merchants to sell their yarn to the replication industry, it is requested that permission be granted to temporarily retain it. Since the yarn merchants were ordered to stop trading in the market, their business has been at a standstill. In order to maintain their survival, the industry previously requested to conduct joint distribution, selling to two groups: one for shipping to other places and one for domestic sales, and also requested the factory to consider reducing the quantity of goods. However, this request has not yet been decided, and there is no way to follow a business plan. Currently, there is a portion of inventory, but once it is sold out, there will be no source. Then all the yarn stores will close down, and the problems of unemployment and commercial depression will be enough to affect the prosperity of the social economy. It is requested to maintain the minimum level of survival for the members. (2) As the joint distribution has not yet been implemented, and the industry has received purchase letters from the replication industry associations in three provinces and one city, as well as Hankou, Changsha, Nanchang, and other places, it is also requested to approve the shipping and sales methods as soon as possible so that they can be followed.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the China Textile Corporation threw 589 pieces of yarn as usual, totaling 46,918.1 gold yuan. The prices were 255 yuan for 6-count sub-sunlight yarn, 528 yuan for 10-count double-strand Lima yarn, 573 yuan for 15-count Fengnian yarn, 787 yuan for 32-count Yanghe yarn, 880 yuan for 40-count sunlight yarn, 990 yuan for 42-count double-strand Lima yarn, 1,010 yuan for 42-count double-strand Baoguang yarn, and 960 yuan for 42-count double-strand Caiqiu second-grade yarn.</p>
<p>In other news, the China Textile Corporation's sales of 20-count yarn on behalf of the fire-stricken households have recently been suspended because most of this batch of yarn can be shipped abroad and is welcomed by the Southeast Asian market. In this way, a large amount of cotton can be easily obtained. Therefore, the Central Bank is considering exporting the stored yarn. However, since the Central Bank stopped allocating yarn, the supply of 20-count yarn has suddenly become difficult. Many people are requesting the allocation to be reopened. It is heard that the Central Bank is planning to release a portion of the 60,000 bales in the short term to continue the allocation.</p>
<p>In other news, the cloth distributed by the Cotton Cloth Association on behalf of the Dyeing and Weaving Association will continue to be allocated this Friday. However, the number of pieces has not yet been determined.</p>
<p>In other news, the Cotton Textile Association of the Jiangsu-Zhejiang-Anhui-Beijing-Shanghai area held the first joint yarn allocation of the sixth phase for private factories on the 12th and 13th of this month. A total of 1,025 pieces of 20-count cotton yarn were allocated. The total amount of yarn and cloth sold by each factory on its own was 15,024 bolts of cotton cloth, equivalent to 1,017 pieces of 20-count cotton yarn.</p>
<h3>Investigation and Registration Deadline Advanced</h3>
<p>The Machine Dyeing and Weaving Industry Association of this city, in order to assist the government in thoroughly implementing the price limit policy, was ordered to investigate the amount of yarn used by the cotton yarn replication industry in order to improve the supply of cotton yarn and make adjustments. The registration of this survey form was originally scheduled to end on the 15th of this month. Now the association has been notified by the Industrial Association that the Materials Adjustment Committee has decided to advance the deadline to the 14th of this month. All members should submit a list of the current monthly yarn usage and operating conditions to the association. Those who fail to submit it by the deadline will be deemed to have waived their rights.</p>
<h3>Export Control Commission Announces Recent Export Situation</h3>
<p>According to the Export Control Commission, the export situation this week (October 2 to 8) is roughly the same as last week. Tung oil prices are rising in the producing areas, and the city's inventory is very scarce, with very few sales. Transactions are almost at a standstill, and exports are shrinking. However, foreign prices have improved due to the Export Control Commission raising the export price limit. The Shanghai FOB price for sales to the United States is still at US$0.185 per pound. According to a London telegram on the 8th, the British C&amp;F price for bulk and barrel packaging has risen to 154 pounds and 162 pounds per ton, respectively. Calculated according to the city's prices, transactions are possible.</p>
<p>The pig bristle market is firm, and people are bullish. Foreign quotations are the same as last week, with Shanghai No. 17 FOB at US$2.45 per pound, and exports are also possible, but not enthusiastic. Tea is still mostly favored overseas. Black tea is popular in the United States and the Soviet Union, and green tea is popular in the Philippines. In mid-month, 9,000 boxes of He Tea will be shipped to the Soviet Union for debt repayment. However, domestic production is decreasing day by day, and the quality is deteriorating. In addition, Japanese tea has better quality and will soon compete in the sea</p>
<p>The raw silk market is sluggish, and there are very few transactions. D-grade raw silk FOB is US$0.28 per pound. In order to alleviate the difficulty of exporting raw silk materials, the Export Control Commission has agreed with the National Bank to continue to allocate 200 piculs of raw silk to assist silk weaving manufacturers in weaving silk fabrics to expand exports.</p>
<p>Domestic prices for feathers have changed little, but foreign quotations have fallen slightly. Gray duck feathers and white goose feathers FOB are priced at US$0.38 and US$0.48 per pound, respectively. According to the city</p>
<p>The foreign price of pig intestines is stable, with salted pig intestines FOB at US$0.18 per pair, but because domestic prices have risen, export profits have decreased slightly compared to last week.</p>
<h3>Tea, Taiwan Salt, and Mineral Sand Shipped to Japan in Batches for Barter</h3>
<p>The Central Trust Bureau's barter trade with Japan will soon ship a large amount of materials. The first batch is tea and tinplate, totaling 2,000 tons, which will be shipped the day after tomorrow morning. The second batch is 8,000 tons of Taiwan salt, which will be shipped to Kobe, Japan, next Tuesday. The third batch is Hubei Dazhi mineral sand. The total amount of this mineral sand shipped to Japan for barter is 200,000 tons. As of the 10th of this month, a total of 80,000 tons have been shipped. Before the end of this month, there are plans to mobilize ten major shipping companies to ship another 75,000 tons. The remaining 40,000 tons will be shipped by the end of next month, one month ahead of the original schedule. Salt is the most needed material in Japan, and the government's policy is that our country's production is not surplus, so the amount shipped this year is very small. The 8,000 tons shipped next Tuesday will be the largest shipment in recent years. There may be another shipment of salt within the year.</p>
<h3>Very Few Rice Transactions as Market Is About to Be Cut Off: Rice Arrivals Sharply Reduced: Thriving Retail Sales in Shantou</h3>
<p>Rice arrivals have been reduced to 136 shi (approx. 13,600kg), and there are very few transactions in the market. The North City's self-transported and self-sold rice accounts for 15 shi. Flour was not traded yesterday, and miscellaneous grain transactions were sluggish. Yesterday, the market only sold more than 30 bags of Poyang yellow soybeans, priced at 13 yuan and 8 jiao. Poyang black beans were traded according to the limit, and Poyang black sesame seeds were sold in dozens of bags, priced at 28 yuan. The remaining grains were not traded.</p>
<p>The cooking oil market was stagnant yesterday. Although the rush to buy various goods has eased in recent days, retail sales of cooking oil are thriving. The first batch of allocated oil has been distributed to retailers yesterday to meet the city's needs. However, the Taishi cooking oil reserves are exceptionally abundant, and citizens can avoid this unhealthy psychology.</p>
<h3>Optimistic Tea Market Exports</h3>
<p>The colors of black and green tea have not been widely available for a long time since the production and inventory were both depleted. Yesterday, the market was also affected by autumn rain, and the sellers were almost completely hidden. The demand from various parties is strong, but transactions lack reality, and the situation has little fluctuation. The price is consistently firm.</p>
<p>According to people in the industry, several trading companies in the city are optimistic about the future of export materials, so they are increasing their export departments. Tea, in particular, is seeing a surge in new companies due to the strong overseas demand. They are seeking tea samples from their counterparts in order to gain an advantage.</p>
<h3>Sugar Slightly Soft</h3>
<p>The free trading of sugar was still extremely sluggish yesterday, but people's sentiment has softened slightly. Lvhong Sugar Company accepted the entrustment of the Social Affairs Bureau to tender for 15,000 bags of Peruvian sugar. The industry's floating capital has an outlet, and some of those short on orders seem to be more willing to sell. However, the demand in this street is slightly weak, and the turnover is not strong. Twenty-second term sand white No. 45 car white refined sugar is not available in the market and has not been traded. Coarse sand and medium sand were slightly traded according to the limit, and the rest of the market was mediocre.</p>
<h3>Silk Production in Zhejiang Province Gradually Increasing</h3>
<p>Zhejiang's climate and soil are most suitable for sericulture. Before the war, among the 76 counties and cities in the province, 58 counties produced silk. In more than 20 counties, sericulture was the main secondary industry for the people. There were more than one million sericulture households, with a mulberry planting area of more than 2.6 million mu. During the peak of the silk industry, the annual output was 900,000 dan of fresh cocoons, 30,000 dan of filature silk, 50,000 dan of native silk, and 2 million bolts of silk fabrics, accounting for one-third of the total national output. Before 1928, silk accounted for the largest share of China's export commodities, and Zhejiang's silk exports accounted for more than 30% of the national silk export volume. The abundance of its production can be imagined.</p>
<p>Mulberry trees are best planted near water, so the distribution of Zhejiang's silk is concentrated in the river and river areas. The most prosperous silk areas can be divided into three areas: the Qiantang River, the Cao'e River, and the area near Taihu Lake. The main districts and outputs are as follows:</p>
<p>The three counties of Wuxing, Jiaxing, and Hangzhou produce 150,000-200,000 dan of fresh cocoons annually. The two counties of Xiaoshan and Haining produce 100,000-150,000 dan. The three counties of Tongxiang, Zhuji, and Jiashan produce 50,000-100,000 dan. The eight counties of Changxing, Deqing, Haiyan, Yuhang, Pinghu, Chongde, Lin'an, and Xinchang produce 10,000-50,000 dan.</p>
<p>Among them, Wuxing, Jiaxing, Hangzhou, Xiaoshan, and Haining account for about 70% of the total output of the province. Therefore, the focus of Zhejiang's sericulture is in the old Hangzhou-Jiaxing-Huzhou prefectures north of the Qiantang River and south of Taihu Lake.</p>
<p>There are two ways to dispose of the cocoons produced in each county: (1) selling them to new-style silk factories to produce filature silk, and (2) farmers using indigenous methods to spin native silk themselves. Before the development of filature silk, native silk was the main product of Zhejiang. During the peak period, the annual output was 30,000 dan of filature silk and 50,000 dan of native silk. Most of Zhejiang's raw silk was used for local silk weaving, and the annual export volume was about 20,000 dan, mainly to Europe and the United States, followed by Southeast Asia and other places.</p>
<p>During the war, all the silk areas in Zhejiang were devastated by the enemy and puppets. Most of the mulberry gardens were abandoned, and most of the silk factories and cocoon markets became ruins. Few breeding farms survived. In total, the loss of silk is estimated to be at least 50 million yuan, calculated in pre-war currency values. After the victory, the government urgently sought to revive the silk industry, and the silk industry has shown a slight recovery. According to statistics, in 1947, there were 474,936 sericulture households in the province, with 995,211 mu of mulberry gardens, producing 175,131 dan of fresh cocoons, about one-fifth of the pre-war output.</p>
<p>In 1948, the Provincial Sericulture Management and Improvement Agency made great efforts to promote and provide regional guidance to sericulture farmers in various places, jointly seeking the reproduction and increase of sericulture. The output in both spring and autumn increased, but the exact figures are still to be investigated and reported. Based on the estimated production of spring and autumn silkworm breeds and feeding harvests, it is estimated that 511,287 spring silkworm breeds and 300,000 local silkworm breeds were raised in the spring, with an average yield of 20 jin of fresh cocoons per breed, producing a total of 162,257 dan of fresh cocoons (this number is similar to the total number of 94,464 dan of fresh cocoons purchased by various spring cocoon purchasing manufacturers, indicating that the difference between the estimate and the actual output is not significant). During the autumn breeding season, 300,000 improved silkworm breeds were raised, and there were no local breeds. Because the harvest was slightly worse than in the spring, with each breed only yielding 15-20 jin of fresh cocoons, the total yield was about 50,000 dan of fresh cocoons. The annual output is estimated to be more than 212,000 dan, an increase of 25% compared to 1947.</p>

<h3>Promoting University Cooperation Among Nations: International Association of Universities to be Established; Exchange of Academic Ideas and Representation of Common Interests of Universities; My Representative Chen Yuan Reports on Participation in Preparatory Meeting</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Office, 13th Dispatch] The United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) convened an international university preparatory meeting in The Hague this August, to which all countries of the world were invited. China was represented by Professor Chen Yuan, who reported on the current state of university education in China. Mr. Chen recently reported the situation of the meeting to the Ministry of Education, with the following summary:</p>
<p>(1) The International University Preparatory Meeting, in order to promote cooperation among universities worldwide, decided to establish an International Association of Universities. Before the establishment of the Association, an interim committee was formed by the preparatory meeting, electing seven individuals to be responsible for the following tasks: A. Drafting an organizational plan for the Association to be submitted for adoption and implementation at the next inaugural general meeting. B. Establishing an International University Promotion Association as soon as possible to be responsible for promoting all work until the general meeting is convened. C. The scope of the Association should include not only universities but also other higher education institutions with equivalent status or nature, as well as schools above the specialized level. (2) Recognizing that universities worldwide, or specialized schools of equivalent status, lack a unified international liaison organization to exchange academic ideas, disseminate school information, promote opportunities for connection and cooperation, and represent the common and consistent interests of various schools, the Fifth Group of UNESCO suggested the establishment of an International University Promotion Committee. The highest authority of the promotion association would be one of three types: A. The association would be directly under UNESCO, with its funding borne by UNESCO. B. The association would be subordinate to other international higher education groups, such as the International Association of University Professors and Lecturers. C. The association would be directly supervised and directed by a conference representing universities worldwide. The Fifth Group reported that the promotion association should be the highest authority and not subordinate to UNESCO, as UNESCO itself cannot assume the responsibility of supervision and direction, but can only assist from the sidelines. As for other international higher education groups, they can only represent partial interests and are insufficient to assume this responsibility. Therefore, it was suggested to organize an International Association of Universities, organized with universities worldwide as the unit. (3) The organizational purpose of the International Association of Universities is to serve as a center for universities worldwide and specialized schools of equivalent status or nature to seek connection and cooperation, and to promote mutual understanding among nations. It will convene international or regional conferences to discuss various issues related to higher education, and investigate the consistent interests of universities in member countries. Important matters such as student health and welfare, university entrance qualifications and degree awarding, academic freedom, university financial overview, student selection standards, teaching methods and curriculum improvement will be appropriately improved. It will also supervise the University Promotion Committee, exercise the collection and dissemination of information and news about member universities, promote the exchange of professors and students among universities, encourage the establishment of scholarships, plan the allocation and exchange of teaching equipment, and promote the development of all member universities. After the establishment of the Promotion Association, the interim committee will convene a general meeting of members to report on the plan to establish the Association and the work of the Promotion Association. The date of the meeting is yet to be determined in consultation with UNESCO, approximately in August 1950. (4) Funding is a decisive factor in the establishment of the Association and the Promotion Association. It is generally believed that all expenses before the work of the interim committee and the Promotion Association begins, and before the Association is formally established, should be borne by UNESCO. After the establishment of the Association, member universities will pay annual fees, and the shortfall will be raised through donations or subsidies from other educational foundation committees. The total estimated cost is approximately US$100,000 per year.</p>
<h3>Chinese Asian Relations Association Elects Five Executive Directors</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Office, 13th Dispatch] The Chinese Asian Relations Association held its first board meeting at the Academia Sinica at 3 p.m. on the 12th.

<h3>National School Teachers' Professional Development Funds to be Submitted to City Bank by Tomorrow</h3>
<p>Second Allocation to be Discussed on the 15th</p>
<p>[Dahua News Agency] The National School Teachers' Professional Development Fund Allocation Committee is scheduled to convene its second meeting at the Education Bureau conference room at 3 p.m. on the 15th of this month to discuss the second allocation of professional development funds. The continued collection of professional development fees from various schools is also limited to being submitted to the City Bank before that date.</p>
<h3>Yangshe Town Experiments with Unified Administration of Politics and Education; School Protection Work Achieves Notable Results</h3>
<p>[Our Wuxi Office] The principle of unified administration of politics and education is to use educational forces to guide local autonomy affairs, and to use autonomy to protect the achievements of education. Yangshe, a small town in Jiangyin County, is currently experimenting with this system and has achieved a preliminary scale. The town is now designated as a "Model Autonomous Region," and the host is both the town mayor and the principal of the central national school, Ms. Xia Yi, 48 years old, a graduate of the Education Department of the former Southeast University. Through a year of practical work, she has overcome obstacles from various parties and gained the support of students' parents and local public opinion. In terms of autonomous administration, rural hospitals are working hard on health care, and cooperatives such as sewing and water pumping serve the farmers, all of which have been established one after another. In terms of local education, the central school guides the schools in each district, adds night schools, eliminates commercial work, and constantly promotes progress. Electrical education is also increasingly used, with radios and film screenings widely available in each district. Recently, in order to cultivate technical talents, a junior vocational school has been surprisingly established this semester, gradually progressing, starting with the strict selection of teachers in order to improve teaching standards. Ms. Xia's spirit of "entering the people" has largely achieved initial success. It is reported that the town also hopes that sincere political scholars and workers will visit for observation or criticism.</p>
<h3>Zhang Boling Returns to Tianjin; School Affairs to be Transferred to He Lian</h3>
<p>[Our Tianjin Office, 13th Dispatch] Zhang Boling returned to Tianjin on the 13th. In addition to presiding over the Nankai University's 44th anniversary celebration on the 17th, he will also handle the handover of school affairs, entrusting the management of Nankai University to He Lian on his behalf.</p>
<h3>Changchun University Actively Prepares to Move to Tianjin; Sharp Decrease in Students in Changchun City, Various Schools Merged</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Tianjin, 13th Dispatch] Changchun University has decided to relocate, and preparations are actively underway. According to President Luo Yunping, more than 700 Changchun University students have arrived in Tianjin so far, and the number is expected to reach 1,200 in the near future. In addition to renting the old site of Juemin Middle School as the school buildings for the three colleges of Literature, Science, and Law, the Medical School has reached a cooperation agreement with the Rear Hospital of the Joint Logistics Headquarters, and classes are expected to begin formally on November 1st.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Changchun, 13th Dispatch] Due to the impact of the war, citizens of Changchun City have been leaving for the south, and the number of students in primary and secondary schools has sharply decreased compared to before. According to a survey by the City Education Bureau last Wednesday, there are only 1,127 middle school students and approximately 10,000 primary school students in the city, both less than one-third of the number at the beginning of the semester. The number of teachers who have resigned is relatively small, approximately less than half. The various primary and secondary schools have now implemented mergers, and the Provincial Department of Education has decided to open social education demonstration areas with the remaining manpower to promote social education.</p>

<h3>Silver Coin Cup Table Tennis Tournament; Shanghai Defeats China Agriculture</h3>
<p>Two More Matches Continued Today</p>
<p>The Second Silver Coin Cup Table Tennis Tournament, Shanghai versus China Agriculture in the silver group was held at the China Table Tennis Room the day before yesterday, and the two sides fought fiercely. Shanghai relied on its average talent and finally defeated China Agriculture by thirteen to nine. In another match, China Blue in the coin group lost to Friendly Nation by a large margin of two to thirteen; China White in the industry group won a big victory over Qian Kang by thirteen to one. Although China has formed three teams to participate in this year's competition, only China Yellow is expected to win the championship. In addition, in the coin group match between Tongshang and Pudong, Pudong's stamina failed to keep up, so they were defeated by six to thirteen. Two more matches will be continued today (the 14th). The results of the day before yesterday and today's schedule are recorded below:</p>
<p>Results of the Day Before Yesterday</p>
<p>Shanghai wins China Agriculture (Silver) 13-9</p>
<p>Friendly Nation wins China Blue (Coin) 13-2</p>
<p>Tongshang wins Pudong (Coin) 13-6</p>

<h3>Ministry of Communications Tennis Annual Tournament; Railway Bureau Returns to Shanghai in Triumph</h3>
<p>The Third Annual Tennis Tournament of the Ministry of Communications and Railways was led by Director Li Zubing of the General Affairs Department of the Ministry of Communications to Shanghai in late September. The Railway Bureau won a narrow victory by eighteen to sixteen, as reported in various newspapers. Subsequently, on the 9th of this month, the Railway Bureau sent a team led by the director to Beijing for the return match. As a result, the Railway Bureau won again by twenty to twelve. It is reported that the Railway Bureau team returned to Shanghai in triumph by express train yesterday.</p>
<p>A tense scene at the finish line of the women's 80-meter hurdles in the World Games. Number 692 is the champion, Ms. Blankers-Koen of the Netherlands, catching up with the British athlete on her right.</p>
<h3>Group C Table Tennis Elimination Tournament; Lingyun Swears to Fight Pudong</h3>
<p>In the third Table Tennis League, four teams from two groups of Group C were selected. In the second elimination round, Pudong will face Lingyun. The match is scheduled to be held at the Jingwu General Association Table Tennis Room on Yokohama Bridge starting at 7:30 PM tonight (the 14th). The referees are Dai Yongquan and Chen Jimao, and the recorder is Li Longbiao.</p>
<p>Pudong is the leader of Group C, Division 2. They train seriously on weekdays and their table tennis skills are advancing rapidly. In particular, the left-handed young player Zhou Jianan is good at attacking and drawing. He is the proud foot of the veteran Chen Linsheng, and has the potential to surpass his master. Other players such as Zhang Jiliang and Han Dalun are also good at drawing. However, under the leadership of Hu Jiankun, the three young players of Lingyun are exceptionally brave. They won the runner-up in Group C, Division 1, and even stronger teams such as Luying Lv, Yinglian Black, and Chou Qing have been defeated by them. The winner of this match has the hope of winning the Group C championship, and the loser can only compete for the third place. At that time, Lingyun must be calm in the game and use softness to overcome hardness, otherwise it may be difficult to defeat Pudong's fierce momentum. The lineups of both sides are recorded below:</p>
<p>(Pudong) Han Xilin (Leader), Zhang Jiliang, Zhou Jianan, Han Dalun, Cai Xiuzhang</p>
<p>(Lingyun) Hu Jiankun (Leader), Wang Weirong, Hu Yangshu, Zhu Jieshang, Lu Chunlin</p>
<p>Also, the day before yesterday (the 12th) was originally the final match for the runner-up between the Jewish team and the Luying team in Group B. However, as that day was the Jewish annual Day of Atonement, all entertainment and banquets were stopped. The organizers specially approved the postponement to next Monday (the 18th), so neither side attended.</p>

<h3>Drunkard Falling from a Carriage</h3>
<p>— Wu Yong</p>
<p>Zhuang Shida Sheng chapter: "When a drunk person falls from a carriage, though it is swift, they do not die. Their bones and joints are the same as others, but the harm they suffer is different. Their spirit is whole, and they are unaware of danger, unaware of tension. Death, life, fright, and fear do not enter their hearts. Therefore, they can move objects without being affected. They are preserved by wine, and are thus protected, let alone by heaven?" This means: a person, when drunk, "death, life, fright, and fear do not enter their hearts," so even if they fall from a swiftly moving carriage, they will not die.</p>
<p>We have heard of drunkards falling from escalators and falling soundly asleep. However, we have never conducted scientific experiments to verify the truth. In history, we have not read of Zhuangzi himself getting drunk and "repeatedly succeeding" in this way. However, if we interpret "their spirit is whole" as "not fearing danger" and "remaining calm," with the spirit not being distracted by external things, or if we interpret the "heaven" in "preserved by heaven" as the "heaven" in "innocence," then this two-thousand-year-old saying of "drunkard falling from a carriage and not dying" has found an example two thousand years later, thousands of miles away in New York.</p>
<p>It turns out that in New York City, a two-year-old child named Cannas Liebman accidentally fell from the window of a six-story building, landing on a patch of grass. He immediately stood up and staggered away, without any injuries. We may also remember that a few years ago, a plane crashed in the suburbs of Shanghai, destroying the aircraft and its passengers, but a small child was unharmed. The reason they didn't die was probably because they were calm and "death, life, fright, and fear did not enter their hearts." What would happen if these two children encountered the same situation thirty years later? By then, they would be worldly and experienced, and would inevitably be nervous and terrified. When they fell to the ground, they would likely shatter like a broken bowl. Hall Bauer, feeling this, made the following remarks:</p>
<p>According to the law, children must go to school and learn from adults. However, the law does not explicitly state that adults must learn from children. In fact, children's words and deeds have much to offer adults. After children grow up, few can maintain this calm spirit. Athletes in the sports world mostly still maintain this spirit. The reason they can become athletes is precisely for this reason. They can often remain calm during competitions, as if nothing is happening, so they can handle their opponents with ease. If a person has to fight against themselves while fighting against their opponent, their chances of winning are very small. When a person's mind is fearful and uneasy, they are fighting against themselves.</p>
<p>Even if people possess everything and reach a point where they no longer need to worry, they still inevitably worry as before. At this time, what they worry about is the possibility of losing all their wealth. It is said that more Americans die from nervous tension than from any other cause. And for many people, overeating is just a sign of inner unrest. This last sentence is similar to the Chinese saying "borrowing wine to drown sorrows."</p>
<p>The main point of this argument is to tell people not to be nervous, so as not to be fearful and uneasy when things happen. Looking at the recent panic buying of goods by people all over the country, their emotions are so panicked and tense that they have never been seen before. To say it calmly and quietly, it is indeed excessive. With everyone worrying like this, it is still the common people who suffer. It must be known that the more people value their own self-interest, the less likely they are to obtain it. The Bible's saying "Whoever does not value their own life will gain life" has a profound meaning.</p>
<p>There is an ancient Chinese saying: those who come after will view today as today views the past. This saying is certainly correct, but Carnegie has a more optimistic saying: today's sorrow will be tomorrow's sorrow, just as yesterday's sorrow is today's sorrow. It means that what people worry about often does not materialize. Therefore, today's general blind following of others, seeing others panic and imitating their panic, is a bit like a blind man riding a blind horse. Instead of doing this, it is certainly better to imitate the "drunkard falling from a carriage."</p>
<h3>Tianfanglou</h3>
<p>— Qian Dacheng</p>
<p>Zhao Liewen of Yanghu built "Tianfanglou" in his later years when he lived in exile. It housed tens of thousands of volumes of books. During the Ding Chou Rebellion, his family sold them all for rice. At that time, I and my friend Cao Jusheng had a "Zegu Bookstore" in our hometown, so we also acquired several kinds. Qian Taiji's hand-annotated "Banma Zi Lei" has already been sold. Jusheng still has Liewen's hand-annotated Jiajing edition of Xue Hui's "Laozi Jijie." Zhao's collection of books all have the large "Tianfanglou" collection seal, as well as a long, rectangular collection seal with many characters, and each volume is stamped. Liewen also marked the volume numbers in red ink, even for common books, not just rare editions.</p>
<p>Liewen, whose courtesy name was Huifu and whose pseudonym was Nengjing Jushi, served in the staff of Zeng Guofan and his brother Guoquan for a very long time. His book "Nengjing Ju Diary" consists of fifty-four volumes (Mr. Chen Naigan's Zhao's Chronological Biography mistakenly states that there are sixty-four volumes. This spring, I met Liewen's grandson-in-law, Wang Jiyu, who said that there are only fifty-four volumes. Jiyu is proficient in cataloging and versionology, and his collection of books is also exquisite. He is now an editor at the National Central Library, so what he said should be accurate.) Among them, there are many anecdotes about the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom. Liewen even had a long conversation with Zhong Wang Li Xiucheng and felt quite sympathetic to Xiucheng, but he was very angry about the atrocities committed by the Qing army after entering Nanjing. He repeatedly advised Zeng Guofan to win back the hearts of the people, but Zeng did not listen. Liewen then left in anger. He was very respectful to Guofan, and Guofan also called the poems written by Liewen's close friends the best. After Guofan's death, he immediately returned south in pain. He purchased land in the west of Changshu and built "Jingpu," which was several tens of acres in size, with a five-room building, which was the so-called "Tianfanglou." He spent his days with friends from Yushan, such as Yang Haosou, Zhao Cihou, and Zeng Junbiao, entertaining himself with literature and wine. He died in the Gui-Si year of the Guangxu reign at the age of sixty-two. Liewen was also well-versed in epigraphy, and all the rubbings of bronzes and stone inscriptions he collected had his own postscripts, but they have now been scattered. Jingpu was purchased by the Sheng family of Wujin and given to the monk Zhikai of Tianzhang Temple, who renamed it "Ningjing Yunshe." The scenery of this garden has changed greatly, but only "Tianfanglou" still stands, but it has been transformed into a Buddhist hall.</p>
<p>Mr. Chen Naigan had an old relationship with the Zhao family and borrowed "Nengjing Ju Diary" for ten days, extracting the essentials and compiling a chronological biography. According to Mr. Wang Jiyu, the diary contains many anecdotes about Xunqing Hall. He once recorded that Grand Secretary Weng Wengong cried bitterly to Emperor Tongzhi because the emperor did not like learning. The emperor then used the sentence from the Analects "A gentleman is not a vessel," covering half of the word "vessel" to show Wengong. This is enough to show that the emperor was quite clever. There are many similar anecdotes. Unfortunately, the manuscript of the diary was also sold off by his descendants, and now it is unknown where it has gone. If a good person were to print it, it would rival the "Yuemantang Diary" and become a treasure trove of Qing Dynasty anecdotes.</p>
<p>In recent times, Mr. Jin Songcen also named his studio "Tianfanglou." Mr. Songcen also had the ambition to serve the world. Both of them grew old as scholars and never fulfilled their ambitions. Having talent without a position is also the fate of the world?</p>
<h3>Miscellaneous Poems from Yi Lou</h3>
<p>— Shi Shufan</p>
<p>Night Tour of Wusong</p>
<p>Fleeing the din at midnight, intention already subtle, sharing with fish swallowing 　 forgetting to return, fireflies pierce white 　 cool 　 air, tide submerges yellow stars breaking stillness, the vast sea does not change with war, who cares about the ruined pass, who does not cherish planning? The wild man without a position sits here idly, tasting the scenery, looking at the sky, clothes full of dew.</p>
<p>Evening Observation of Rickshaw Pullers Gathering to Eat Cakes Outside the Alley</p>
<p>Evening wind cold, shadows of trees slant, wheat cakes along the street with clear tea, broken clothes need not levy cotton tax, scorched earth still a beautiful fire flower. Sitting watching green and yellow exchange years, faintly hearing that nineteen have no home, a full meal in Jiangnan is a great blessing, how can I bear to think of the grass buds in Guandong!</p>
<p>Double Ninth Festival</p>
<p>Fallen leaves, the spiritual banners passing faintly, Qing Qi, a strand connected to Luan River, climbing high, looking far, autumn is boundless, drinking wine for joy, not much land, yellow chrysanthemums can know the Lament for Ying, white clothes, do not sing the Crossing the River Song! Next year, few people, wormwood and weeds flourish, what will it be like when the Double Ninth comes again?</p>
<h3>No Eggs to Eat</h3>
<p>— Du Yun</p>
<p>Some people admire the British for their thrift, each person eating only one egg a week, but unbeknownst to them, in Shanghai, there are no eggs to buy, 　　　　　　　　they are about to disappear.</p>
<p>According to people in the egg industry, they sincerely support the August 19th price limit and are willing to sell at the limit price, but after August 19th, some people have been raising prices step by step, searching and buying in the production areas. The net cost of each egg arriving in Shanghai has risen from five cents to one dime, and there is still a trend of continuous increase. With a cost of one dime and selling at six cents, there is no profit to be made and a loss must be taken. Who would be willing to do this business?</p>
<p>A certain gentleman went to Yangzhou to purchase eggs and only saw that the Yangzhou egg shops were closed during the day and the staff were sleeping, and began to operate late at night. Since August 19th, the local egg limit price has been 34 yuan per hundred catties, but because there are ice egg factories and soil egg factories setting up shops in the area to raise prices and search for eggs, each hundred catties of raw eggs is 62 yuan, plus an extra 2 catties. Calculating this, it exceeds the limit price by more than double. If they collect goods during the day, there will be a group of uniformed individuals who will purchase from the merchants at the limit price. If they don't approve it, they will be charged with the crime of hoarding and speculation. If they approve it, they will lose half of their capital. Therefore, they have no choice but to tell the egg vendors to secretly deliver the eggs to the shops in the middle of the night. As a result, everyone sleeps during the day and engages in the black market at night. Of course, from now on, Shanghainese will never be able to eat envious eggs again.</p>
<h3>Talking About Paper</h3>
<p>— Ze Shi</p>
<p>The Chinese have an old saying: "Seven things to start the day: firewood, rice, oil, salt, 　　 tea." Now it is now, the seven things to start the day may have increased to seventy or decreased to three and a half. It seems that there is no definite thing to say, at least tobacco is already one of the several things to start the day, which was not the case in the past.</p>
<p>I don't know if the seven things to start the day are the same as what is now called daily necessities? If so, then today it is "six things to start the day: rice, noodles, oil, cloth, and paper." The authorities say so, the newspapers say so.</p>
<p>Thinking carefully, I feel that it is very inappropriate. Why are there no firewood or coal briquettes in daily necessities? Why is there paper - newsprint and coarse paper? "Try to ask a passerby", there is no one who does not use firewood in a day, there must be "all under heaven" who do not buy newsprint or even coarse paper in a year. Why is something used every day not included in daily necessities, and something not used even once a year included in daily necessities?</p>
<p>Is it because you and I read the newspaper every day that the newspaper has become a daily necessity? Regardless of the four or five million people in Shanghai, the best-selling newspaper only claims to sell 150,000 copies a day. Even if each person has one copy, if newspapers are to be included in daily necessities, they must also include ink, as well as our articles - I am wrong, articles have already been invisibly included in "daily necessities" - without increasing the manuscript fee.</p>
<p>Writing this, I read in the newspaper that the Social Affairs Bureau has decided on the purchase of paper according to the request of paper merchants: (1) those who have quotas, such as bookstores, must not buy paper from paper shops anymore; (2) out-of-towners cannot buy paper in Shanghai; (3) individuals can buy a maximum of five reams. May I ask, if I want to print a book but have no quota, what should I do? Also: individuals can buy five reams, but individuals have no use for newsprint. Allowing them to buy five reams is not encouraging scalpers and promoting hoarding of paper?</p>
<p>Strange, strange!</p>
<p>###</p>
<p>Exchange gold, exchange gold, exchange again and again, thousands of people, suddenly a "dou-sized golden seal" appears! This is the treasure that the descendants of Prince Yu of the Qing Dynasty, who are now widely rumored, asked the Central Bank of Peiping to exchange for gold yuan coupons.</p>
<p>The seals we usually see are mostly made of bronze, silver ones are rare, and gold ones are only heard of. During the imperial era, the emperor's seals had "Bao" and "　", and their quality was "gold" and "jade"; the prince's seal was called "Bao", and its quality was "gold"; the seals of first- and second-rank officials were called "Yin", and their quality was "silver"; only Shuntian Prefecture of the third rank used a silver seal, and other officials of the third rank and below in the capital and provinces used bronze seals; minor officials had both bronze and wood. Statistically, bronze was the most common and widespread, while gold and silver were relatively few. However, counting the various ministries and agencies in Kyoto, the various banners, and the governors, provincial treasurers, admirals, generals, and commanders-in-chief of the outer provinces, the number of silver seals was still considerable. Only gold ones were limited to 　 chambers and shrines, so they were the rarest and least sold. 　 Prince Yu was one of the meritorious nobles who entered the customs in the early Qing Dynasty. It has been hereditary for three hundred years, and this seal can be called an antique. Its palace was in the east of the city, and it was a large scale. It was sold to Westerners early in the Republic of China, and the descendants have declined. Now the family heirloom is being sold. The noble 　 of the past, the down-and-out descendants of the princes, the changes of the world are mostly like this. The seal is three inches and six points square and weighs 270 taels. After arriving at the bank, it was cut open and inspected, and more than 200 taels of pure gold were obtained, which could be exchanged for about 50,000 gold yuan coupons. The seller can afford to be warm and full, and the central bank's exchange is relatively large, which is a happy event. Suddenly, the Palace Museum heard about it and said that this was a precious object with historical value and should be moved to the museum for preservation, which is reasonable, but the seller's purpose is to exchange it for cash to make a living, and the bank that exchanges it is responsible for exchanging and buying gold, and doesn't care if it's precious. The positions of all parties are different, and the concepts are different, which is also an interesting twist.</p>
<p>"Yin" is a common name. Except for the "Bao" and "　" of emperors, the official seals of various yamen in the capital and provinces are square, in the various 　 of the internal ministries, in the two provincial treasurer offices of the outer provinces, transport envoys, and the newly added educational commissioners at the end of the Qing Dynasty, and even the prefects, magistrates, county magistrates, prefectural classics, and patrol inspectors, are all square, and their sizes are divided according to their ranks. A first-rank seal is about three inches and three points (per side), a second-rank seal is about three inches, a third-rank seal is two inches and seven or eight points, a fourth-rank seal is two inches and five points, and fifth, sixth, seventh, eighth, and ninth-rank seals are reduced by several points in order, until the small seal of a ninth-rank patrol inspector, which is as small as Suzhou-style "five-spice dried tofu". However, the engraved characters are exquisite, so they are worth playing with. The so-called size is the official inch, which is only 80% of the old market inch, so this Prince Yu's seal (the original "Prince Yu of the Qing Dynasty He Shuobao" six characters) is named three inches and six points square, but it is actually only "two inches and eight points and eight li". I obtained a prefect's seal (fourth rank), which is named two inches and five points square, but it is actually only two inches.</p>
<p>There are many names for rectangular ones. Governors-general, governors, and educational administrators use them, and their inscription is "Guanfang" (because the governors-general and governors are officials of the Ministry of War and the Censorate who supervise the local area, and their hall seals are used jointly by the yamen in the capital and cannot be taken out of the capital, so a separate "Guanfang" is issued. In the Ming Dynasty, it was called "half seal". Educational administrators are also officials released from the capital, so they also only have "Guanfang" and no seal.) Next are the Taoist platforms, which are assistants to the two provincial treasurer offices. In the Ming Dynasty, the Taoist platforms all had the original street titles of participating political affairs of the provincial treasurer office, or deputy envoys and vice-prefectural title of the provincial inspectorate. Their seals are in the provincial capital and cannot be carried with them, so they also use "Guanfang", such as the Shanghai Taoist officials in the past, although they were large, had no seal, while the Shanghai county officials, although they were small, had a square seal. Next are the assistant administrators and registrars, who are assistants to the prefects. The prefect's yamen has a prefect's seal, while the assistant administrators and registrars use "Guanfang". The assistant miscellaneous officials in the counties and districts have wooden, bronze, square, and rectangular ones. For example, the registrar only uses a wood-carved "Lingji" (rectangular), commonly known as "wooden chop", which is made by official craftsmen in the provincial capital (bronze seals and Guanfang of all sizes are cast and issued by the Ministry of Rites in the capital). At the end of the Qing Dynasty, many new bureaus and schools were established in various provinces, mostly led by Taoist and prefectural officials, although they were fourth-rank officials, they used "Guanfang", but they were not substantive positions, and they were also "wooden chops", not eligible to receive the central seal.</p>
<p>The number of silver seals of the former Qing Dynasty, combined with the first- and second-rank officials of more than twenty provinces, was truly not small. Taking Jiangsu Province as an example, one governor-general, one governor, two provincial treasurer offices, one grain transport governor (later changed to Jiangbei admiral), and some generals, commanders-in-chief, deputy commanders-in-chief, naval admirals, and various town generals, already amounted to no less than twenty. Averaging two hundred taels of silver per seal, there were about four or five hundred seals nationwide. During the Xinhai Revolution, many were hidden far away with their seals, or were lost in exile. It is unknown where they have gone.</p>
