<p>翁文灝在立院報告時情形</p>
<h3 id="c1">坦白分析妝前危機　力謀打開沉悶局勢　翁文灝在立院報告施政 <a href="#c1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>〔本報南京十一日電〕立法院第一會期第九次會議，十一日舉行。長九時一刻開會，孫院長主席，報告事項一一完畢後，復通過王普涵·程天放等緊急動議，對聽取政院施政報告後質詢提出之順序，為概括檢討國防軍事問題·財政經濟問題·外交間題及其他問題。九時五十分，由行政院長翁文灝作就任後之首次施政報告、全文約萬餘字。翁氏以冷靜態度，坦白分析目前行政上之危機，並以堅定之語氣表示，渠將毅然肩此重任，打開沉悶巳久之政局。並強調加強剿匪實力為其當前努力之最大日標。</p>
<p>翁氏首強調國家局勢嚴重，革新求治，為期野一致之期望，政院將根據憲法及國策施政，而常前最重要之任務，厥為戡亂，以戢止共匪恃武力從事政爭之企圖。軍事方面決加強東北·華北之保持，改善士兵待遇，激勵士氣，同時澄淸役政，扶助地方武力，務使一致認識保家剿共為人民對國家最大貢獻。渠不願亦不能答覆何時可竟戡亂全功，然謂如能於兩年內剿平，已為極佳成績。至其他施政，則均為配合戡亂，決以廉潔有能之政府，渡此嚴重時局。預算仍分為普通及特別兩部，特別部門殆皆軍費之籌措及支出，民食可賴美援補充，軍糧仍不得不繼續征實征借，唯當極力求其辦理簡捷確實，以免擾民。</p>
<h3 id="c2">健全地方組織　配合軍事戡亂　改革幣制考慮妥善有效辦法 <a href="#c2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>內政方而以地方組織之健全為要務，省縣自治通則草案，正愼研中，地方政府之效能，必須提高，使政令貫瀲，俾靈活配合軍事，助成戡亂。財政方面，收入部門，稅收為主，制度及稅例均待積極改良，有錢出錢之原則，須予確立，先明瞭大財產情况，嚴格實施姓名使用條例，登記財產，然後決定目標，簡化手續，有效征收財產稅，所得稅，遣產稅等，使財富集中地之大城市亦克盡納稅義務，稅例將從優計算，缺乏效率之稅收機構決加裁撤。至支出部門，政府機關應切實緊縮或裁併，而以人才缺乏及事業等待開展之地安挿，救濟失業。改革幣制一事，牽涉太多，不能不考慮一妥善易行最有效之辦法，發行債劵必先樹信，始克有吸收游資，安定市塲，减少走私之效。經濟方面，對外貿易輸出品增列台糖·水泥·棉紗·棉布，份量亦求加多，再以政治力之施用與愛國心之喚醒消除走私行為，並鼓勵僑胞，以增現款之匯入，俾平衡支出。</p>
<h3 id="c3">以供應與配售　解決物價問題 <a href="#c3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>物價則題將以充份供應與普遍配售解決之公營事業售價之調整，各使合理漸增，以免刺激一般物價。建設方面三項要務，準備於最短期內展開，（一）工業生產及交通建設，勝利後，華北，東北工鑛，交通，迭遭匪軍破壞，而今後建設，僅可能於萬難中打開局面，依戡亂方針，設法策劃進行，報載工業南遷，純屬謠言，政府迄仍打算為戰區工業補充機件，原料，然為確保南方，規復北方，江南實應早立基礎，故粵漢，浙贛兩路之運輪力及沿海與台灣之建設，務須加強，尤其已具規模成就之紡織業，亟應設法使之獲得原棉，以免停頓。（二）地籍整理及分配問題，二五减租及綏區土地整理早在進行，今後將繼續根據國家土地政策，設計妥善辦法，切實執行，俾解決土地問題，並使國際間認識共匪之所謂土地政策實係胡作非為。（三）農業生產改良問題，我國乃以農立國，然並無悖于發展工業，農業生產改良，尤賴工業運用，水利肥料及機械農具之充分供應，為增加生產及節省人力之重要手段</p>
<h3 id="c4">外交仍本　一貫國策 <a href="#c4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>外交方面，仍本一貫國策，以通過聯合國共謀世界和平為第一要務，繼續敦睦各與國邦交，尤以美國為重。對日政策，決堅持已定立塲，軍事侵略性必予根除，國民生活必需工業則可保留，同時，並決心不願見其赤化，凡盟國於對日問題與我意見相若者我可贊同，否則當予反對。至亞洲新興各國，我國將與之交好，如人口衆多之印度與我國聯合一致，終必可促進世界和平。美援之效用，依其性質分為兩部，一部為物資，可助我减少入超，售價且可使法幣回籠，一部為借款，可助我農工生產建設之復興，其運用方式，張前院長會手訂十項原則，今仍適用，決加強工作，使之實現。教育·文化方面設施，需要加強，年來共黨多方利用學生，影響後方社會秩序之安寗，故除正常之文教工作外，不能不注意思想教育。最後翁氏並聲明，行政負責者決心努力不懈，至祈立院除對行憲有一致目標外，戡亂工作亦能同心協力進行，克竞全功。</p>
<h3 id="c5">立委熱烈質詢　精闢言論屢見不鮮　今開第十次會議繼續質詢 <a href="#c5" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e5" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">5</a></h3>
<p>翁氏報告法十一時十分完畢，歷時一小時又二十分鐘。孫院長當宣布，依據議則第九章之規定，立院于聽取施政報告後，可即席提出質詢，要求發言者極踴躍，每人對此國家大事，都應有發言機會，當徵詢會衆同意，質詢應任之進行，一日未畢，再續一日。旋於休息後，孫院長再度呼籲會衆應為民主而耐煩。十一時四十分開始質詢，午前會議至十二時半散會，午後會議亦延至六時半散會，口頭發問者共廿三人，書面提出意見者亦達十餘人，請求發言者至散會時猶絡繹不絕，會議進行緊張熱烈，精闢言論亦屢見不鮮。賴鏈，谷正縣，杜光塤，蕭錚，陳紹腎，張潛華，程天放，孫桂籍等先後提出大體之檢討，多以為翁氏報告四平八穩，面面顧到，然實失之空洞，陳明者為目的希望如何達成，實現之方針辦法則未具體提出。賴璉並指出，年來戡亂軍事節節失利，今後如何加強軍事？如何用兵？如何改善士兵待遇？最近物資飛騰，可視為對新政府之挑戰，如何應付？外交政策是否仍沿襲無能作風？抑將　新　訂？前方剿匪，後方鬧學潮，有無適當有效措施？渠稱：翁院長臨危受命，至堪欽佩，立院雖已勉強同意，然如拿不出辦法，亦難獲國人信任。谷正鼎指出，目前地方組織之不稱職，地方首畏鮮够標準，旋云戡亂何不將此製造共匪之基層澈加整頓，至外交政策為戡亂即須反共，今後有何理由繼續搖擺不定。蕭鍾質間（一）用甚麽戡亂？單應軍事而無民生主義，一切空談。（二）用甚麽方針平抑物價？平衡預算是否仍繼續發行政策？（三）如何加強地方行政？是否繼續任用軍人主持省政？（四）農林工商業務亟要，何以竟以祿位數衍友黨，而使責任無人來負？陳組腎強調翁氏報告之施政方針未顧及時間性，以致燕重心主題，並指責政院對戡亂毫無進度，缺乏信心。張　華謂，翁內閣旣未逃脫舊人事圈子，難望有何作為，何不於用人上一新國人耳目，勵精圖治。程天放亦指出，施政方針沒有時效進度及具體辦法，應預立半年施政目標，以表現效率如何。孫桂籍則就觀念上糾責翁氏報告中之錯誤，（一）強調華南為戡亂基礎，有擾亂北方人心之虞，（二）土地改革不及於後方，是否政府之土地政策必待共匪破壤後方可實施，（三）報告中如何忽視就業問題，救濟並非根本安定社會之途，（四）美國扶植日本應予重視，如何不調查日本現勢，報告國叭，如何對吾人應得日本賠償不自力爭，一味向美國借貸求人。此外，潘朝英·丘漢平·吳尚應等均提出僑匯及保僑問題，吳復質詢國防部長何以仍為軍人，並謂對消除軍隊派系集團及嚴明賞罰，整肅軍紀，有無辦法。馬乘風·陳逸雲·杜光塤·趙珮·王普涵等均就軍事措施之具體辦法要求說明。高廷梓提出如何平抑物價及何時改革幣制之問題。李曜林建議政院應尋出過去失敗者所遇阻力何在，如何可予消除。簡貫三謂，新內閣自院長以下多實業八材，對經建有何辦法，應拿出來。徐中齊·趙惠謨等均質詢對物價狂漲有何辦法。全部質詢以口頭發言與書面意見宣讀交替進行，翁院長及各部會首長亦均全日靜坐生席台兩側聆聽，並隨時筆記，至散會時間，孫院長宣稱：其餘待發言者百餘人，留待十二日續會，再行質詢，後即告散會。</p>
<p>〔又電〕立法院十二日舉行第十次會議，繼續進行對行政院施政方針報告之質詢，如時間充裕，並將由翁院長或有關部會首長一先作部份口頭答覆。</p>

<h3 id="c10">霍夫曼要求國會　恢復援華款原額　賴普漢亦稱削減不啻自食其言 <a href="#c10" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e10" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">10</a></h3>
<p>〔中央社華盛頓十日電〕美國經濟合作局執行長官霍夫受，今要求國會恢復援華計劃之四億六千三百萬美元之原數。渠認為眾院削减六千三百萬美元，幷延展三個月之舉，將嚴重危害打擊中國共產黨之計劃。霍氏聲明係由經濟介作局特別帮辦程爾在參院撥款委會中宣讀。霍氏稱：援華計劃旨在使中國政府克服通貨膨脹，與制勝共匪時作必要之急務。彼指出賴普漢已抵華，彼僅等待堅定之執行計劃，俾檢討各種需要，幷規定組織之內容。霍氏列舉因內戰而起之財政與經濟之迅速變化中，援華計劃所面臨之各種困難。彼稱：中國所需要之人員，較歐洲國家所需要者尤大。中國局勢之基本原因，為對付日寇與共匪之長期破壞，與範圍廣闊之鬥爭，致通貨膨脹日甚一日。中國本依賴進口維持其經濟，乃通貨膨脹與其他因素，已削减其出口與美元匯款，因此减低中國償付進口之能力。霍氏聲稱：單憑美援，尚不能協助中國解決各種困難，但僅能延緩其經濟惡化之程度而已。霍氏最後指出衆院於削减六千萬美元時，幷未指明此次削减是否自軍事款項中核計之。</p>
<p>〔本市訊〕賴普漢氏昨就美衆院削减援歐及援華款項一事，告往訪之記者稱：渠支持范登堡氏之意見，希望國會不致通渦援款之削减。賴氏稱：吾人曾允諾各國曁中國，今如削减，不啻自食其言。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕據悉賴普漢目下在滬之工作，除與我國有關方面接觸外，注朮內部之組織事項。因賴氏隻身來華，故將來美援機構之組成，將大部調用中華救濟團之工作人員。賴普漢曁調查團昨巳遷入當士德研究所，山華救濟團原址辦公。昨日午後央行總裁俞鴻鈞自京返滬後，即往訪晤賴氏，商討有關美援各項問題，約一小時許始辭出。</p>

<p>〔本報迪化十日電〕十日為北塔山事件一週年紀念，我駐防北塔山之國軍，已在險惡困難之環境下度過一週年。回想去年今日，正是敵人以猛烈之陸空聯合火力，予我守軍以奇製，卒賴我忠勇將士堅苦應戰，保全國王，固守陣地。記者特於本日走訪此間新近視察北塔山防務歸來之騎兵指揮官馬呈祥將軍，承告：自事件發生以來，先後共進行激烈之戰鬥凡六次，敵人終未獲逞，去年入冬以來，北塔山任高寒之侵襲下，敵人雖對我守軍暫停攻擊，而終無撤退之跡象，故我守軍不能不作長期駐防之準備，己於冬前完成禦寒設備，構築地下兵舍·馬廐及俱樂部，以安定官兵生活。馬將軍對北塔山守軍之刻苦耐勞，備加獎勉，謂渠等在嚴寒之荒山中，苦鬬一年，尚無一病兵嬴馬，實為難能可貴。記者繼續詢以北塔山最近有無發生戰事之可能？馬將軍特加重語氣答記者：戰事早於一年前開始，入侵我國境六百華里之外蒙騎兵，只有增加，並未减少，現正積極加強後方運輸，構築陣地工事，與我對峙於北塔山下，其威脅新疆和平之危機迄未解除；至於戰鬬行為，隨時均可發生。總之，外蒙軍隊一日不撤出我國境以外，則我新疆邊防一日不得安寗云。</p>

<h3 id="c24">從新閣的施政方針說起 <a href="#c24" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e24" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">24</a></h3>
<p>新內閣的施政方針，翁院長巳於昨日向立法院提出報告了。這不僅是立法院與行政院關係的樞紐；而且也是中外人士一致所重視的焦點。新內閣於本月一日成立後，社會上一些人士即以為新內閣的舊人太多，舊人物行不出新政，故對新內閣頗多不滿意的批評；不過大多數的人民，在新內閣的施政方針未發表之前，對於新內閣還是抱着期望的態度，希望翁院長能拿出新辦法來挽回當前的危機。</p>
<p>但是翁院長昨天向立法院所提出的施政報告，不僅是官樣文章，而且其內容空泛平凡，毫無新政的氣象，簡直是前內閣的繼續；新內閣在部長人選方面，旣嫌舊人太多，僅有三四人的更迭；在施政方針方面，又是前內閣的一套老調，怎能滿足國人對於「用新人行新政」的期望，又怎能符合一般人民「思變」的心理！所以在翁院長報告之後，即有許多立法委員紛紛提出實詢，並有不滿意的表示。使翁內閣又遭遇到了一道更嚴重的考騐。</p>
<p>照目前國內局勢分析，戡亂建國是今天的國是，誰也不能表示反對，所以時局的中心問題，正迥繞於軍事及經濟兩個重點之上。戡亂建國固然可以說是一個軍事問題，同時也可以說是一個經濟問題；在此期間的任何政府的施政重心，都要集中在這兩個問題之上。再從今天國內的實際情形　來，軍事與經濟已在無形中成為一個問題的兩面，常常互為因果，前綫軍事的失利，固會加深經濟的危機；後方經濟的亂紊，也會加深軍事的危機。所以這兩個問題若須改革，就得要雙管齊下同時着手改革。而今日之翁內閣，又是我國行憲後的第一任內閣，其當前的任務，不僅要收拾舊局，而且還要開創新局而，其所負責任固然特別重大；但按之實際，新內閣的施政方針的重心，仍應集中在這兩個問題之上，換言之，軍事若能好轉，經濟若能穩定，則其他的問題，都不難迎刃而解。我們評論新內閣，檢討新閣的施政方針，不必議論其他，只要看新聞如何打開軍事的困難，如何克服經濟的危機，也就可以判斷它的成敗了。</p>
<p>我們且看新內閣的施政方針，關於軍事方面，新　擬採取下列各項：（一）繼續增強兵力；（二）提高士兵待遇；（三）團結士氣；（四）扶植地方武力；充分發揮地方的保安力量，以協助戡亂國軍的作戰。關於經濟方面：（一）善用美援，一則利用美方物資，穩定物價；另則利用美國貸款，增加生產；（二）努力經濟建設，但仍以適應戡亂需要為前提；（三）關於預算，一使經常預算　量保持平衡，另使特別曾算根據戰事需要而定，並將繼續征糧征餉，開征財產稅，以祁收支之不足；（四）財政方面，開源節流，除加強說收以外，並當節省開支，並將根據實際需要，而實行幣制改革；。金融方面，繼續加強管制；（六）　　方面，一面實行土地改革，實行土地重新分配；一面努力生產技術的改進，以增加生產。</p>
<p>從上述的施政方針裏，我們的確找不到新政的跡象；不過為政不多言，唯力行而巳；翁院長在戰前即以學者的身份，參加政府，負開發資源之責，在抗戰期間，主持經濟部及戰時生產局，抗戰勝利後，曾任行政院副院長，資源委員會委員長，歷任要戴均卓著政績，向為中外人士所效仰，惟翁院畏是一個不尚空談但求實際的科學家，不會不顧現實大唱其高調，所以我們決不可因為翁院長的施政方針沒有提高調子，而表示失望；假如翁院長能實事求是，說出一句做到一句，二三個月以後，也不難使整個局勢獲得轉機。</p>
<p>雖然我們也不能否認，翁內閣的本身是脆弱的，再加以翁院長本人是一個樸實　華的科學家，要他去應付五六百位立法委員，本來就不是一件容易的事情；但是我們分析目前的時局，翁內閣澤是值得我們人民支持的。眼前的一二個月，是翁內閣靑黃不接的最感困難的時期。若能在人民的支持下安然渡過難關，翁內閣的地位就可以日見增強。所以在今天，我們還　該熱烈鼓勵新內閣，在全國不滿　氣氛中，加倍努力，一面　力更生，一面　用美援，只要有計劃，有魄力，二三個月之衝，自能挽回經濟上的危機，打開軍事上的難關。目前國人的批評，猶不足為翁內閣成敗的定論！</p>
<h3 id="c25">中國工業管理協會　滬分會成立日　荘智煥等發抒觀感 <a href="#c25" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e25" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">25</a></h3>
<p>中國工業管理協會之組織，總會在首都客歲成立，對會務推進，工作程序，均經一一確定，上海分會積極籌備以來，已具端倪，今日為大會成立之日，莊智煥及夏宗輝二先生特發抒宏論，交本報發表，深信必能提起工業界學術界人士對管理問題之興趣及注意，並謀　實施上之改進。（編者）</p>
<p>莊智煥先生首先就工業管理學與我國工業建設問題，發表其見解如次：</p>
<p>工業管理學的研究對象，係在技術改進之外，更進一步探索人力與機械如何謀取最高效率的組織管理與配合使用。它的主要內容可包括四個部分：一是生產的管理，目標在維持大量生產及產品標準化。二是財務的管理，目標在合理營運資本以减低成本增加利潤。三是人事的管理，目標在提高員工的素質及工作效能，使人適其事，事得其人。四是動作的研究（Motion　study），目標在檢討每一生產過程的各種動作，期其合理迅速節省時間並减少疲勞，從而發揮工作效率與生產能力至最高度。動作研究是工業管理的最新課目，必須根據人類的生理條件，心理條件以及各種機械的一般性能與特殊性能，乃至每一動作的各種因素，作深入而客觀的研究分析，才可以設計　新的更合理的生產程序生產方法與生產工具。</p>
<p>工業管理學之被介紹於我國，是近二十年來的事。惟因傳統的保守觀念所蒙蔽，且過去人工成本極度低廉，市塲競爭並不劇烈，所以一般國人對現代化的生產設備與技術雖相當重視，但對於工業管理的重要價值反缺乏認識。實則現代化的生產設備與生產技術，必須配合以現代化的管理方法與管理制度，否則儘管有了與歐美同等的機器及技師，結果所生產的產品，無論品質數量或製造成本乃至全般工作效率，必永難望歐美項背。我國苟欲推進工業化的建設，則技術與管理並重的原則必須首予確認。過去因人工低曉，致舊式鄉土手工業不失其繼續苟延的餘地，而現代化的工業生產則無從健全發展。但此種浪費勞力時間的傳統作風，如不澈底革新，必致工業建設永無成功之望，而欲轉變農業社會為工業社會，尤非消除過去負號生產的現象不可。美國工資高昻，固需利賴現代管理方法，而我國目前一般工資之高，亦遠非昔日可比，所以今日而言工業建設，更非講求工業管理之學，藉以减輕製造成本與提高生產效率不為功。茲欣逢中國工業管理協會上海分會正式成立，爰簡陳雨點期望，聊由慶祝的微忱：</p>
<p>第一，展開工業管理理論的研究：工業管理學乃工業先進國家所創造的學科，欲將之移植中國，必須經過一番培養的工夫。如何始可不致盲目抄　外國，並使理論與實際密切配合，是有待於我人的共同努力了</p>
<p>第二，推廣工業管理人才的訓練：工業管理人才的培植，無疑是今後當務之急。惟目前我國各大學中僅交通大學有工業管理系之設立，顯不敷今後工業建設的需要。此外，一般工程人員亦必須認　管理與技術之不可分割，而促成工程人才與工業人才條件兼備的全能人才，　　得我人之致</p>
<p>夏宗　先生認為工業製造，複雜禽端，管理範圍，煞費籌思，渠更按製造程序，途徑先後，對管理工作實施對象之任務範國，具體地分為下列十端，並述其梗概如次：</p>
<p>（一）資金之調度——資金一項原為生產要素之一，在創業之始，舉凡企業之大小，工廠籌設之規模，莫不以資金數額為繩準。始業之後，資金之運用及流轉，預算之編製，及其他有關財務之問題，如會計制度之制定，成本之計算，更莫不需要縝密之策略，與夫適宜之措置為之統盤籌劃，而奠定事業之基礎也。</p>
<p>（二）廠房之佈置——以製造原料產地之區別，運輸工具之種類，氣候對製品之影響，動力燃料之供應，人工代價之高下等問題之限制，對廠房坐落之斟定，首當考慮。他如廠房之製造，光綫之強度，空氣之調節，室內色彩之規定等工作，均需妥為設計，冀得良好之工作環境而增加生產效率。</p>
<p>（三）機器之排列——若製造全程其製品經過之機器為連續性者，則對機器排列之次序及高下，均當安排妥善，蓋如此則人體精力之消耗及傳遞阻滯之時間，當可大為减少。</p>
<p>（四）原料之採購——如經濟安定，物價上落，變化殊徵。製造所需原料之購置，自不必大量存儲，其數量之決定當按生產需要週轉而定，其準確數量之決定，當有公式演算之。</p>
<p>（五）人力之運用——量力取用，各盡其極，截長補短，始克有濟。對於智力之抉擇當利用工業心理學測騐之帮助，以探求才智之當量，以適應工作之需要而達成效率之後果。</p>
<p>（六）方法之改進——製造日繁，方法日異，推陳出新，始有進步。根據巳往使用，啓發後來演化，作精密之考研，始有成就。</p>
<p>（七）動作之研究——生產開始，機器人力之動作隨之而生。根據一般情形，在完成某項固定工作之全部動作中，恒有不必要之動作片段，或意外之延滯，滲雜其間，非有精細之分析，往往不易察覺。動作研究之目的乃求以簡捷之動作舉止，最低之勞力消耗獲取時間及工作之兩大成就也。研究之實施當有多種器材及影片之分析可供參考作改進試騐之基礎。</p>
<p>（八）商品之檢討——產品種類繁多，質度形色不一，修整添配，煞費苦心。是以對產品標準化統一化問題，歐美各國推行已久，並得皇皇成績。國中工業謀取進步，則急起直追，實為刻不容緩之舉。他如包裝之設計，須詳為考慮，使用之功能，亦須詳為表明以利行銷。</p>
<p>（九）市塲之分配——市塲調查，區域劃分，消費情形之記錄，顧客心理之分析以及統計表格之編製等工作，均須次第進行，作產銷工作之最後努力。</p>
<p>（十）管理之實施——分門工作，旣經規劃，部份管理，尤重聯繫。欲使各部工作共嗚協助，傳遞圓滑，當有綜合性之全盤管　為之制定系統，推行政策，觀察效果，期完成工業管理之至要任務。</p>
<p>綜合上述各點，對工業管理之完滿任務，可作下列之叙述：「籌劃足額資金，設置合用廠房及適宜機器，加入切當原料，利用改良方法及合理動作，實施人工簡約，對優越　品，經努力推銷，配以科學管理，以最低代價，獲得最大之生產效果。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕倫敦十一日廣播：阿曼訊，外約但總理本日預測阿拉伯國家可能拒絕與猶太人同坐於羅特島和平大會之席上，渠謂此乃阿拉伯之「傳統」政策。渠復稱阿拉伯國家仍不願接受聖地之分治計劃，茍猶人堅特成立猶太國，則和平談判必無結果。和談至少在一星期內不致開始。阿方此次同意停戰無非因聯合國調解員貝那多特一再聲明對於巴勒斯坦問題不受過去決議約束，並稱羅特島和談或能產生一種解決方案，可被阿方接受，且對雙方均屬公平。</p>
<p>〔合眾社台拉維夫十一日電〕巴勒斯坦之戰爭業於十一日上午六時（格林威治標準時間）按照聯合國安全理事會所建議之二十八日休戰計劃而停止，但十日晚阿猶雙方均曾作最後一擊。猶方派道飛機轟炸叙利亞首都大馬色，而阿軍則以戰爭以來最激烈之砲火轟擊耶路撒冷之猶太區。阿猶雙方槍砲之聲方告寂靜，政治戰爭相繼而起。以色列總理戈里翁宣佈猶人決不放棄在戰爭中所佔領之阿拉伯區域，而阿拉伯最高司令外約丹國阿勒勃杜拉則在阿曼申明阿拉伯決不同意於使阿拉伯人隸屬於巴勒斯坦猶太國之和平。</p>
<p>〔合衆社阿曼十一日電〕外約丹國王阿勃杜拉十一日在此單獨接見本社記者時談稱，阿拉伯決不接受猶人得在巴勒斯坦設立猶太獨立國之任何休戰。阿氏繼稱，聖地之全部統治權應為「整個巴勒斯坦阿拉伯國家之主權，吾人準備與巴勒斯坦國家之猶人合併，猶人在巴勒斯坦國內能享受與阿拉伯人同樣之權利，彼等在彼等之城市與居留地中能有得等所希望之政府，但絕無統治權，統治權乃整個巴勒斯坦中阿拉伯國家之主權」。阿勃杜拉續稱，如猶人不接受無統治權之和平，而「巴勒斯坦戰爭」如仍繼續進行，或將引起第三次大戰。</p>

<p>（一）事先何人向系科代表大會要求行動？</p>
<p>答：在系科代表大會中有十六班（電三，電管三，化三，理一，運三甲，運三乙，運一，運二甲，機二，土四結，紡二，土三甲，水二，工一，工二，造四），正式發言要求行動，結果通過（有紀錄可查），所謂行動，為一般廣泛之行動，包括通電，發宣言，擴大宣傳遊行等，並不專指遊行示威。</p>
<p>（二）在系科代表大會內何人主張罷課遊行？</p>
<p>答：在系科代表大會內有五班（化三，工一，運三甲，電三運二甲），正式發言提出遊行，結果通過，無罷課之議（有紀錄可查）</p>
<p>（三）在系科代表大會內何人提出主張十一時聚餐，一時在外灘集合？</p>
<p>答：十一時用膳（並非聚餐），是由自治會和國立交通大學反對美國扶植日本搶救民族危機委員會聯席會上議決，並未決定一時在外灘集合。</p>
<p>（四）科系代表大會係於下午三時開始集會，五時結束，何時與本市一百二十團體聯繫決定同時出發在外灘集合？</p>
<p>（五）若在五時表決以後開始聯繫，則用何種辦法竟能如此神速得與一百二十團體獲取聯繫？（此為決不可能之事實）。</p>
<p>答：在上海市一百二十校聯合舉行之五四營火會時，巳成立「上海市反對美國扶植日本搶救民族危機聯合會」嗣於五，二二，舉行之五，廿紀念會上決定各校採取積極行動及遊行日期，惟參加與否，須由各校自行決定，本校之科系代表大會係根據該會之號召及六百餘同學簽名之請求所召開。</p>
<p>（六）若在料系代表大會以前即與各團體聯繫採取共同行動，則代表交大者究係何人？在何地與何人聯擊？</p>
<p>答：在系科代表大會以前，並未與他校（非團體）聯繫採取此次示威遊行之共同行動，在本校反對美國扶植日本挽救民族危機委員會未成立前，由自治會參加者，無固定人選，視幹事中當時無課者担任，（與他校反美扶日委員會聯繫）。</p>
<p>（七）一百二十團體其名目為何？又主持者何人？</p>
<p>答：此一百二十團體之名目為「上海市學生反對美國扶植日本搶救民族危機聯合會」主持人由各校輪流担任云云。按學生報告中關於一百一十八學校名稱，均為本市各大中小學，並聲明其中僅僅少數學生參加而不能代表其全體，本校認為此稱報告旣不能確定參加之學校單位，亦未便根據轉告以免損害其他學校之校譽而使本校負無謂之責任，准函前由相應將所查經過備函奉復，即希望照為荷，此致上海市政府校長程孝剛</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕居住陝西南路鴻安坊內破亭子間之王仲英，自將價值美金十萬元之新安輪無條件捐出後，渠本人竟成一傳奇式人物，為各界前往訪問之對象。小學生，公務員，基督教徒，佛教徒及軍人等各階層人士，紛紛去函向其致敬。甚且有浦丂路某君以家庭糾紛招致莫大苦惱，聞日前曾親往訪王，亦擬無條件捐獻共私人財產。記者頃晤及王君，渠表示對各界慰勉，至為感激，倘更有人能繼起響應，則尤表示愉快。關於靑島英記輪船行及上海辦事處兩機構，近正由王由極辦理結東事宜，所有職業約十一二人，將從優發給遣散費。現該行副經理胡寶三，已於日前自靑來滬，計議一切，至新安輪上船員一律由英濟茲善基金保委會留用，照常發放薪津。航行業務，己決由招商局代理。旋王君又向記者詳述其生平稱，渠於民國十六年，即在靑島創設英記船行，並在沈鴻列長靑市時，任港務局會計主任及航業公會常務理事。嗣在滬又代理英商巨輪卅餘艘之保險運輸業務，固亦為當時航業界巨縣之一。抗戰軍興，不幸在靑島為日憲逮捕，禁閉七日，並遭鞭笞毒殺。旋為人保出，逃來上海，所有船隻財產至此乃蕩然無祚。十餘年來始終陽居現住之亭子間內，貧病交迫，甚且有時三餐難繼。迨至新安輪由招商局交還後，猶擬再振舊業，渠曾斥資修船，恢復公司，但以該輪屢應軍運，營業困難，至去年年底負債達二十四億元左右，再加渠體弱多病，而人心澆薄，羣作錦上添花，家庭刺激，有增無减，有此數重原因，故早蓄意將此身外之物移作有利公衆之用。乃有本月七日贈船之舉。</p>
<p>家庭屢經慘變　飽嚐人世痛苦</p>
<p>至王君之家庭情形，據談，渠之會祖曾任四川知府，祖父亦為四品知府，當時在北方與丁汝昌等為換帖弟兄，與李鴻章交誼亦極深。平生極　作慈善事業，當光緒某年咸海衛大糧荒時，曾以銀三千兩賑災。王父在前淸亦有功名，及至王本人時，始外出就業。渠現有二弟，目下俱在靑島，姊妹四人，一在大連，一在福州、一則尚留於匪區內。其二姊年已六十五歲，為畢庶澄之嫂氏，最近方自匪區逃來，孑然一身，所有家產亦均蕩然無存。王本人於成婚之後，旋以意見不合仳離。後又娶一婦，並領養子女各一，但未及成年，俱先後夭折。其婦且因刺激過度，已落髮修行。故王雖祗五十三歲，而已飽嚐人世間之痛苦，固已至萬念俱灰之境矣。</p>
<p>吳市長前會喊王人市立醫院休養，惟渠已另延醫師診治。據稱腸，胃，肺，腦，俱有疾患，非專家治療，長期休養不為功。渠告記者，設數月內能將疾病治痊，則甚願為英　　善　金保管委員會義務服務，否則當覓一寺廟作其歸宿云。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕自禁止票據抵用實施後，市面行莊本票數量驟見增加，滬金管局為防行莊濫發空頭本票，增加信用驚碼，影響物價彼動起見，巳自上星期六起，先後派出稽核人員十組，檢查各行莊簽發本票情形。一面並訂就嚴格管理辦法，通令銀錢信託三業同業公會，轉行遵照。茲探悉此項辦法為：</p>
<p>（一）本票之開發，如應客戶之要求，則必須該戶帳內存有餘額，成以現鈔掉換，並應於交、易發生時開發，不得預先將本票付給客戶。</p>
<p>（二）本票收回後，應即轉帳註銷，不得抵庫，或作為籌碼，轉付其他客戶。</p>
<p>（二）凡行莊開發之本票，除繳納本身稅款之外，應限於客戶之要求，其當天本票科目之餘額，無論該項本票用途如何，必須有十足之頭寸存放庫存中央銀行票據交換所或其他同業。</p>
<p>（四）行莊對開發本票，如遠反上項規定，經金管局查明屬實者，予以嚴重懲處。</p>
<p>〔又訊〕上海金管局為减少本票流通，籍以防止信用膨脹起見，特於昨日上午十一時，邀集本市銀錢信托三業公會負責人，有所洽商。聞當時研討之內容，着重如何在禁止抵用之原則下，儘量减少本票之流通額，當經決定原則兩項：（一）推行保付支票以替代本票，（二）根據郃令規定，凡正當工廠，可由行莊愼重訂定抵用契約。三公會將根據此兩原則，即日召開會議，擬定實施辦法。</p>

<p>（十）結匯證明書，私相買賣，其市塲必甚紊亂，影響出口貨品成本之預計，最好有公開市塲，逐日掛牌，以求劃一。</p>
<p>（十一）結匯證明書之轉讓，應不受區域限制，例如甲地出超，乙地入超，可准許甲地之結匯證明書，在乙地轉讓，至轉讓期間，以七天為限，未免太短，應予展長。惟展期太長，恐有操縱居奇流弊，似可以二星期為度，比較適當。</p>
<p>（十二）結匯證明書之轉讓，應以一次為限，即出口商或僑匯收款人，所領結匯證明書售與進口商後，該進口商，不得再將此項證明書轉售第三者，以免資力雄厚之進口商，大量收買轉售，從中操縱，謀取暴利。</p>
<p>（十三）每季限額，最好分作三次發給輸入許可證，即每季限額分三個月分發許可證，進口商每月可結匯三分之一限額，其理由如下：目前實行新結匯辦法，出口固有增加，但其增加程度，究屬逐漸性質，出口商所得之結匯證明書，各月份不至過分突增，而限額公布之時，各進口商以提早結匯，比較有利，勢必爭先恐後，收買證明書，因為量之鉅，勢必供不應求，只有資力雄厚，活動力特強之進口商，可以滿足其需要。至資力稍遜之工廠，必至向隅，中央銀行雖可發給特種證明書，以資調劑，惟各進口商，每季限額所需結匯證明書，旣於第一月獲得滿足，則第二第三兩月，必大量减少，或無需要。果爾，則第二第三兩月結匯證明書之售價，必至慘跌，出口商蒙受損失至大，故為市塲平穩計，每季限額以分月發給輸入許可證，分月結匯為宜。</p>
<p>（十四）中央銀行，於結匯證明書供過於求時，應以最高價收買，求過於供時，應加量供給，使無抬價居奇供需失調之弊，否則進出口雙方均不免蒙受損失，而使輸出入貿易，陷於混亂之境。</p>
<p>（十五）出口商因輸出有利可圖，自備資金，可能增加，其所需政府貸款，當可减少，惟自產地收買貨品，運至輸出口岸，需時頗久，資金週轉仍有需要，故今後打包貸款，仍須辦理，不可停止。</p>
<p>（十六）促進出口原可改善國民經濟，尤以廣大農村，必須受到好處，前此因中間人層層剝削，以致直接生產者，仍處困境，只有少數中間人，獲得厚利，殊失改善國民經濟之旨。今後有關當局，應共同研究方案，使輸出利益能儘量惠及直接生產者，不為少數人所獨享。</p>
<p>（十七）關於僑匯之結匯辦法，一·手續上應力謀簡便；二·僑匯結匯證明書出售所得之差額，應力求與市價接近；此中問題複雜，應由主管機關，詳細研究辦法，以利實施，俾可收到吸收僑匯之實效。（完）</p>

<h3 id="c134">「復堂詞序」試釋 <a href="#c134" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e134" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">134</a></h3>
<p>— 程會昌</p>
<p>譚獻是淸代詞人當中的一個優秀作家。這是大家都知道的。他的復堂詞有一篇極短的自序。全文是：</p>
<p>周美成云：「流潦妨車戰。」又曰：「衣潤費鑪烟。」辛幼安云：「不知筋力衰多少，但覺新來嬾上樓。」塡詞者，試於此消息之。不侫悅學卅年，稍習文筆。大慚小慚，細及倚聲。鄉人項生（按名鴻祚，字蓮生，有憶雲詞。）以爲：「不爲無益之事，何以遺有涯之生？」其言危苦，然而知二五而未知十也。譚獻書。</p>
<p>這篇序沒有年代。不過據譚氏復堂詞錄——一部由唐至明的選集——自序說：</p>
<p>獻年十五而學詩。二十二……乃始爲詞。……三十而後審其流別。……年踰四十，益明於古樂之似在樂府，樂府之餘在詞。……年至五十，其見始定。</p>
<p>拿詞序「悅學卅年」與詞錄序「年至五十，其見始定」對照，前面那篇短文裘的意見，無疑地是他對於詞的「晚年定論」。</p>
<p>但，詞序的意義却是够糢糊的。第一，他截取了周辛兩家詞三首中的四句，認爲人們應該就這些例十來參透作詞的消息。這四句詞究竟代表些什麼呢？第二，他認爲項蓮生的那兩句話只說着了一面，他的話却占着另外一面。如果不能貫通，便是「知二五而未知十」。那麼，這個「二五」和「十」的區別又在那兒？</p>
<p>本文的用意便是企岡對這兩點作一個推測性的答案。爲了方便起見，先把三首詞全篇鈔在下面：</p>
<p>周美成大師（春雨）</p>
<p>對宿烟收，春禽靜，飛雨時嗚高屋。牆頭靑玉斾，洗鉛霜都盡，嫩梢相觸。潤逼琴絲，寒侵枕障，蟲網吹黏簾竹。郵亭無人處，聽檐聲不斷，困眠初熟。奈愁極頓驚，夢輕難記，自憐幽獨。行人歸意速，最先念念流潦妨車轂。怎奈向，蘭成憔悴，衛玠淸贏，等閒時，易傷心目。未怪平陽客，雙淚落，笛中哀曲。况蕭索，靑蕪國。紅糝鋪地，門外荆桃如菽，夜游共誰秉燭。</p>
<p>周美成滿庭芳（夏日潥水無想山作）</p>
<p>風老鶯雛，雨肥梅子，午陰嘉樹淸圓。地卑山近，衣潤費鑪烟。人靜烏鳶自樂，小橋外，新綠濺濺。憑闌久，黃蘆苦竹，疑泛九江船。年年如社燕，飄流瀚海，來寄修橡。且莫思身外，長近尊前。憔悴江南倦客，不堪聽急管繁絃。歌筵畔，先安枕　，容我醉時眠。</p>
<p>辛幼安　鷓鴣天（鵝湖歸病起作）</p>
<p>枕筆溪堂冷欲收，斷雲依水晚來收。紅蓮相倚渾如醉，白烏無言定自愁。書咄咄，且休休。一邱一壑也風流。不知筋力衰多少，但覺新來懶上樓。</p>
<p>譚氏對於詞的意見，許多散見於文集和日記中，但他所評的周正庵詞辨是更其市要的。在詞辨評裏，他對周詞大酺「行人」二句的意見是：</p>
<p>亦新亭之淚。</p>
<p>對滿庭芳「地卑」二句的意見是：</p>
<p>覺離騷廿五，去人不遠。</p>
<p>對辛詞那篇，郤沒有論到。就論到的周詞兩條而論，還是無法直接拿來解釋詞序，因爲文字太簡單，使人一時不能從新亭這個故事和楚詞這部古書聯想到如何「消息之」。因此，我們要解決這個疑團，還得回到詞的本身，從分析他們的表現方式下手。</p>
<p>就詞論詞，譚氏所舉的幾句，在這三首詢中，所表現的情景都很淸楚。大醜，如題所示，是檔寫春雨的。上片是作奢在客舍中被雨聲驚酸後的所聞所見所感——生理的和心理的，下片才由中途的孤寂想到回家的困難。「行人邱意速」，是就過去現在說，皖事實說；「流潦妨車戰」，是此未來說，就想象說。因爲急於回家，所以一聽見下雨，便立刻發生泥漿滿路，車輪阻滯，無法趕路等等念頭了。滿庭芳通首是一個「江南倦客」的感覺。大體是上片寫景，下片寫情。是寫景有實有虛，應當分別開來看。如「黃蘆苦竹」是實，「泛九江船」郤是虛，只不過用白樂天琵琶行的典故而已。「地卑山近」也是實，而「衣潤費鑪烟」郤未必當時確有其事。這一句的作用也無非補足上句對於地方卑涇的描寫而已。因爲下面講到「憑闌」，講到「尊前」，「歌筵畔」，才是當時的一貫情事。作者決不會，而且不應該忽然在喝酒聽歌的時候，忙裏倫閒去烘起衣服來。至如鷓鴣天，則是一個遲暮英雄在平淡生活中所顯示的沈痛心情。這位拿「萬字平戎策」換「東家種樹書」的老鬭士的苦悶，是很淸楚的。在這首詞衷，也決不是因爲偶然上樓感覺費事，才忽而意識到筋力巳衰。也未必在作詞時動過上樓的念頭。只是由「筋力衰」而想到「嬾上樓」而已。</p>
<p>假使上面所說的和作者的本意相差不太遠，那麼，我們便可以從譚氏所提到的幾句詞的表現方式上，歸納出一個共同點。這便是，他們全采用了透過一層的想法。「流潦」是否已經「妨」了「車戰」呢？並沒有。只是因爲有雨，便想到「流潦妨車戰」罷了。「衣潤」是否已經「費」了「鑪烟」呢？並沒有，只是因爲土地卑濕，便想到「衣潤費鑪烟」罷了。是否「上」過「樓」了呢？也沒有。只是因爲「筋力」已「衰」，便想到「上樓」都「嬾」罷了。</p>
<p>於是，進一步，我們要問：這一種方式何以値得譚氏如此重視呢？那就牽涉到他對於詞的看法了。從張阜文詞選推尊詞體，把詞認爲也與詩經楚詞爲同等的價値以後，所謂溫柔敦厚，忠愛纏綿之類，便也成爲作詞論詞的最高標準。周止菴的「寄託」論，陳亦峯的一沈鬱」說，都是張氏的餘波。其問略有異同，大體還是一貫。當時這種理論，可說風行一世。譚氏生在張周之後，而與亦峯同時，正是那個環境當中的人物。他的復堂詞錄序論到詞的宗旨，說：</p>
<p>上之言志永言，次之志潔行芳，而後洋洋乎會於風雅。</p>
<p>這完全與常州派諸人是同一觀點。文學而拿溫柔敦厚忠愛纏綿作標準，原本於儒家的偷理思想，即所謂忠恕之道是。忠是盡己，恕是推己及人，也就是同情的伸展。在心理發展上，文字表現上，推此及彼，設身處地去透過一層想，本是邁進一步的看法，也是同情的具體顯示。這種方式，可以代替別人想，也可以單就自己想。可以由自己想到別人，現在想到過去或未來，這裏想到那邊，或者完全反渦來。如左列這些例子，都屬於這個類型：</p>
<p>杜子美　月夜</p>
<p>今夜鄭州月，闖中只獨看。</p>
<p>方虛谷　九日</p>
<p>山雨初開一望之，料無筋力可登危。</p>
<p>柳書卿　八聲甘州</p>
<p>想佳人妝樓凝望，誤幾回天際識歸舟。</p>
<p>辛幼安　摸魚兒</p>
<p>惜春常怕花開早。</p>
<p>所以，這種方式，在一般推尊詞體的人們看來，他不僅本身是一種技巧，一種增加情感深度和廣度的技巧，也同時是溫柔敦厚忠愛縣綿的直接證明。因爲他能使作品達到作者所預期的崇高效果。譚氏所舉的三個例子，恰巧都是這麼透進一層想的，無怪他要鄭而重之的寫出來作爲「晚年定論」而敎「塡詞者試於此消息之」了。關於這一個推測，譚氏自己作的詞也有可以供參證的。例如：</p>
<p>蘇幕遮</p>
<p>陌上桃花，門內先憔悴。</p>
<p>角招（荷華）</p>
<p>欲壽雲際岫，盪槳采菱，多刺傷手。</p>
<p>憶舊游　（題太長，從略。）</p>
<p>秋凉綺懷减，想似水僧寮，潤到衣裳。</p>
<p>臨江仙（紀別）</p>
<p>啼痕欲寫臉邊霞，無言强忍，怕染路旁花。</p>
<p>這都與序中及我前面所舉的同一機杼。可見譚氏對於此義，不僅是知，而且竟是知行合一了。至於詞辨評裏的「新亭之淚」和「離騷廿五去人不遠」的話，則是拿比興來說詞，認爲周詞所說人事就是國事。也即譚氏在復堂詞錄序所說的：</p>
<p>作者之用心未必然，而讀者之用心何必不然。</p>
<p>與詞序所舉，似乎是兩回事。說到比與和溫柔敎厚之類，關係自然也極密切。不過本文却不能牽涉了。</p>
<p>現在，我們再來談另一點，即譚項二人意見的差異問題。如前所述，譚氏的詞論是治　常州派的，他們把詞的地位看得很崇高。而項氏却把他認爲是「遺有涯之生」的「無益之事」，換句話說，只承認是一種消閒的玩藝兒。這自然是譚氏所不能贊同的。並且，用什麼方式才能達到溫柔敦厚忠愛纏綿的目的，在技巧上也還有一段不簡單的過程，決非用「無益之事」幾個字可以抹殺的。所以，譚氏雖然明知項氏的話是傷心人別有懷抱的「危苦之辭」，也不能不認爲他只知「二五」而不知「十」了。</p>

<h3 id="c135">跋唐寫本孫愐唐韻殘葉 <a href="#c135" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e135" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">135</a></h3>
<p>— 周祖謨</p>
<p>此唐寫本韻書殘葉存法國巴黎國家岡書館，爲伯希和得自敦煌者。伯氏之編號爲二〇一八。原帙爲卷子本，此則但存其東冬鍾三韻十四行而已。以字體論，蓋中唐以後之人所書。雖無書名及作者姓氏，然考其反切用字多與陸法言王仁煦書不合。如冬韻賓藏宗反，陸韻長孫箋注本（即王寫本切韻第二種）及故宮所藏項跋本宋跋本兩王韻均作在宗反；　又之戎反，長孫書及王韻作又職隆反；響力冬反，長孫書及王韻作力宗反；宗作冬反，長孫書作作綜反，王韻作作琮反；容以恭反，長孫書及王韻作餘封反；皆其不合者也。案其體制實與蔣斧舊藏之唐韻相符，故可定爲孫愐之書。何以言之！今舉五事以爲證：</p>
<p>（一）此殘本紐首一字之注文，皆訓釋列前，反切列後，與唐韻相合。</p>
<p>（二）此本每紐收字頗多，凡有新增之字紐首旣稱「幾加幾」，而每一新加之字，皆一一分別注明，體例極爲精審，與唐韻正合。如龍下云：「力鍾反，七加三」，其下驚幾籠三字則均分別注有「加」字。唐韻未韻欲下云：「許旣反，六加二」，其下愾餼二字亦然。唐韻中若此者尙多，無煩徧舉。即此足證兩本體例全同矣。</p>
<p>（三）孫愐唐序有「其有異聞，奇怪傳說，姓氏原由，土地物產，山河草木，烏獸蟲魚，備載其間，皆引憑據，隨韻編記」之語。今此本注文頗繁，廣引羣書以爲憑體，而於姓氏地理尤爲詳切，更與孫序相符。甚且援引之書亦同於蔣斧本唐韻。如殘本中媳下引淮南子，蝮下云「出異物志」；冬下云「亦姓，前燕慕容皝左司馬冬壽」，此即出前燕錄。又嫭下引字樣，春下引世本，松下引玄中記，賓靈二字下引廣雅，蓬浲忪難猜諸字下引說文之類，其搜羅之廣已可槪見。而蔣氏唐韻中暮韻慕字下引前燕錄，霰韻燕字下引字樣，櫛韻蠶下層韻頡下引淮南子，合韻納下引異物志等，援據之書亦同。二者勢必出於一人之手甚明。</p>
<p>（四）廣韻三鍾恭字下注云：「陸以恭蜙樅等入冬韻非也」，王靜安先生已確定此爲唐韻之舊文（見觀堂集林卷八書吳縣蔣氏藏唐寫本唐韻後），則此三紐之移入鍾韻蓋自孫愐始。今此殘本冬韻「農」紐下雖殘闕不完，然與長孫書比觀，則此下當爲「農」紐及「攻」紐字，不復有恭蜙樅三紐。且此三鍾韻之「容」字，音爲以恭反，以「恭」字爲切語，尤可證恭蜙樅三紐已歸入鐘韻；與靜安先生之言適合。</p>
<p>（五）此殘本質昔藏宗，宗音作冬，與長孫書及王韻不合，而與大徐說文及小徐說文篆韻譜十卷本並合。夫大徐所定之音已明言本諸孫愐，是此殘本必與大徐所據之唐韻爲一書矣。惟此容字音爲以恭反，大徐說文則作余封反，小有不同耳。</p>
<p>有此五證，是此寫本之孫愐唐韻，蓋無疑義也。向者靜安先生謂廣韻恭下之注語爲唐韻之舊文，本爲推想之辭，今乃不意於此殘葉之中竟得其佐證，斯所謂事之難期奢往往旦暮遇之也。然則此雖寥寥十數行，亦可珍矣。</p>
<h3 id="c136">更正「章實齊年譜」的錯誤 <a href="#c136" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e136" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">136</a></h3>
<p>— 姚敬存　胡適</p>
<p>適之先生：</p>
<p>你十幾年前的舊作　實齋先生年譜，明快扼要，實在是一本好書。半年前，我曾瀏覽一遍，今日我又從頭細讀，在年譜正文第三頁到第四頁，不滿三百字中，我發現有兩處可以商量，願向先生說明，先生明達，當能諒其鹵莽。</p>
<p>首先，我將先生的原文抄下：</p>
<p>乾隆三年，戊午（西歷一七三八）先生生。（任幼植別傳）</p>
<p>前一年，丁巳，先生之父驤衢先生會試下第，寓從子垣業（允功）家。（從嫂荀孺人行實）大約旋即回紹興。</p>
<p>是年，先生之友人任大椿（別植）生於興化。（任別傳）是年先生之師朱筠（竹君，筒河）已十歲。同時名人，袁枚（子才）已二十三歲。錢大昕（曉徵，辛楣）巳十一歲，載震（東原）已十六歲。浙東前輩萬經（貞一）已八十歲，全祖望（紹衣，謝山）已三十四歲。</p>
<p>乾隆四年，己未（一七三九）</p>
<p>先生二歲。</p>
<p>二三歲時，從叔衡一常携向隣店朱叟索酒，日以爲常。（十叔父八十序），故先生長而善飲。</p>
<p>這年七月，淸廷修明史吿成。學風一變而矜尙四書文藝了。（東華錄葉鶴塗文集序）</p>
<p>乾隆五年，庚申（一七四〇）</p>
<p>先生三歲。</p>
<p>這年，崔述生於大名，趙蠶生於陽湖。</p>
<p>淸廷修大淸一統志成。（志序）乾隆六年，辛酉（一七四一）</p>
<p>先生四歲。</p>
<p>這年萬經卒，年八十（原書此處無標點）。</p>
<p>以上這四條內，有兩點可議：</p>
<p>第一：關於萬經的享年。乾隆三年，他旣已八十歲，乾隆六年卒時，不當仍爲八十。這一點，也許排印時爲手民所誤。先生的原稿，當不是這個樣子。</p>
<p>第二：關於趙翼的生年。據以上幾條則趙翼生於乾隆五年，比實齋小二歲，比錢大昕小十三歲。但錢大昕作廿二史剳記序中明明說：</p>
<p>一余（大昕）生平嗜好與先生（趙翼）同，又少於先生二歲」。</p>
<p>可見，趙翼比錢大昕還要大二歲，那麼，又要比實齋大十三了。他的生年應在雍正四年，丙午（西曆一七二六），不當在實齊已三歲的乾隆五年。這個推論，與先生的說法相去十五年，且先生於乾隆五年，趙翼生於陽湖條下，又未註明出處，未知熟是？</p>
<p>以上兩點，如蒙指示，則不勝企盼之至。再我所看的，章實齋先生年譜是商務印書館出版，民國二十二年五月國難後第一版。我所看的廿二史剳記是世界書局印行的，民國二十五年十二月第一版，合併聲明，以供先生參閱比較。</p>
<p>敬祝安好。姚競存上（卅七，五，廿四日）</p>
<p>競存先生：</p>
<p>謝謝你的指敎。</p>
<p>童實齋年譜是我在二十多年前試做的。印行之後，我才得見劉翰怡先生刻的章氏遺書，其中有「庚辛之間亡友傳」。那時我就想修正這部年譜。後來一位靑年學者姚名達先生把新出的材料加進我的原書，就成了你看見的章實齋年譜。那是用胡適姚名達兩人的姓名出版的。（民國十一年的原版只用我一人的姓名。）</p>
<p>我讀了你的信，就翻開我的原書，才知道你指出的錯誤都是姚名達先生修改此書時偶然不小心的錯誤。我的原譜只有乾隆三年與乾隆七年。中間乾隆四年至六年的記載都是姚君補加的。</p>
<p>乾隆三年之下，「大約旋即回紹興」一句是姚君加的。又萬經全祖望兩人的年歲也是姚君加的。萬經生於順治十六年己亥（一六五九），到乾隆三年（一七三八）是八十歲，到乾隆六年（一七四一）他死時應該是八十三歲。</p>
<p>錢大昕生於雍正六年正月初七日（一七二八年二月十六），這是根據王昶作的墓誌。乾隆三年錢氏十一歲，是不錯的。</p>
<p>趙翼生於雍正五年十月二十二日（一七二七年十二月四日），故他比錢大昕只大兩個半月。錢氏作廿二史剳記序。說他比趙氏小二歲，似是誤記，也許「二歲」是一二月」的誤寫。你推算趙翼生在雍正四年，是錯了一年。姚名達先生大概把雍正五年看錯作乾隆五年，故錯了十三年。</p>
<p>關於趙莫的生年月日，孫星衍作的墓誌沒有記載。全集附錢有甌北年譜，說他生於雍正五年十月二十二日，與甌北詩集卷四四及卷四八所記生日相合。故錢大昕序中說他小兩歲，必是錯誤。此序不會收在潛研堂文集裏，故我們沒有別本校訂這一個「歲」字了。</p>
<p>你讀書如此細心，一定還可以校出姚名達先生和我兩人更多的錯誤。姚君現在已作了古人，我要特別謝謝你。</p>

<p>— 樂英</p>
<p>「不是很書天的春天」巳經過去，目前正是「夏日炎炎正好眠」的時候了。尤其是午後上第一課，「正好眠」的誘惑力特別强，若先生正好講的是宋明理學或十三世紀的神學之類，則不作宰予之晝寢者，恐怕未之有也。寫到此地，想起一件舊事來了，據說蘇州某私立中學曾有一位姓吳的算學敎員，此君身體頗胖，某年夏天敎書時，指了黑板上一個算題呌學生作答，學生演算未畢、先生竟巳倚在黑板前酣然入夢，鼾聲大作。</p>
<p>出席聯合國各項會議的各位外交家恐怕倒和盛夏上踝的學生們頗有同感。會議天天開，說來說去無非是這一套，演辭之空洞且不必說，而且都是其長無比，還要經過翻譯，好容易聽完了一大篇，接着反對方而又來了，又是一大篇，「疲勞轟炸」更番不己，聰得實在難受，却又在衆目睽睽之下，旣不能溜出去散散心，又不能偷偷睡他一覺。</p>
<p>於是乎，這些莊嚴肅穆的代表們拿起了桌上的鉛筆，在自己的筆記本上寫着，寫着……</p>
<p>他們倒底寫了些什麼呢？</p>
<p>一個新聞記者想解答　個問題。他用盡了方法，聯絡代表們的隨員，賄賂打掃房間的女傭，費盡心機，才覓到了這裏的幾張。</p>
<p>可是，這些「墨賽」有些什麼意義呢？那位記者去請敎了一位心理分析的專家—巴特學院的名敎授吳爾孚博士（Dr．WernerWolff）。下面是吳爾孚的分析。</p>
<p>葛羅米柯把同樣的綫條重複不已，表示出他的神經極度緊張，正如有許多自己經常感到被壓迫的人們一樣。他似乎被迫作某一件事情，而且覺得非做了再做不可。至於左上角的那一雙描得濃濃的限睛，却表示了葛羅米柯覺得許多事件他自己不能作主，他的責任是「觀察」，觀察就需要眼睛，所以他把這只眼睛畫得特別着力。</p>
<p>白俄羅斯代表基賽來夫事實上是經常唯葛羅米柯的馬首是瞻的，但這張畫裏許多方框之密密相運，却表示了他的恐懼。他怕許多單位會脫離開來，所以用盡了方法使它們連結在一起。方框中的許多細綫，表示他的緊張，憂慮，恐懼。至於那張畫右面的一個「是」字（Yes），却要看當日討論些什麼東西而定。</p>
<p>范登堡的那張「人像」，表示出作者常常神游於白日夢於眞實之問。他筆下的那個「人」是很可怕的，尤其是那副眼鏡和那一雙眼睛，頗有魔力，而衣袋內的手帕和領帶上的竇石却又表示他頗有勢力，也頗喜修飾。范登堡實在是對這種人頗具戒心的。（據搜集這些「墨竇」的記者說，范登堡是在各種集會山最喜歡東塗西抹的人。）</p>
<p>杜勒期畫的都是蛇。吳爾字博士說，一般人雖然都以爲蛇是危險與侵略的象徵，但這幾條蛇的頭都頗像溫文爾雅的天鵝，看上去那位作者倒是力求和平處世的，所以把凶惡的東西畫得那麼「善相」。</p>
<p>皮社爾的織細柔弱的筆調，表示出他非常敏感，有些神經質，容易憂鬱，常常焦躁不安。</p>
<p>顧少川的字，據吳爾孚博士的說法是「抽象，富於審美觀念。」他說寫這幾個字的人在處理事務一定也偏重於抽象的，或原則的一方面。但我們中國人一看却覺得這幾個字的意義相當明顯。「麻煩」，「假仁假義」——不是那些外交演說最確切的評語嗎？而顧博士用心之細，却在這幾個工整的「雕空字」中表露無遺！</p>
<p>最後是聯合國秘書長賴依。吳爾孚說，這張紙上字多畫少，表示此人喜說理，少作爲。吳爾孚不但說着了賴依的性格，而且也說出了賴依所主持的聯合國機構的特徵。事實上，如果聯合國不是那麼一個專門說理不休的機關，那麼這許多外交家也就未必會有那些間情逸緻來留下這些「墨寶」了。</p>
<p>〔聯合國機構的各位代表在舌劍唇槍之餘，偶然也會隨意塗抹，頗多妙趣。這裏七件「傑作」的創造者是：右起（一）聯合國安理會前蘇聯代表蘇外次葛羅米柯；（二）聯合國大會白俄羅斯代表基賽來夫；（三）聯合國大會美代表美參院外交委員會主席范澄堡；（四）聯合國美代表曾被維辛斯基痛駡爲「戰爭販子」的杜勒斯；（五）法國外交部長皮社爾；（六）我國駐美大使顧維鈞；（七）聯合國秘書長賴依。（請參看本版「國際舞台上的閒情逸致」一文）〕</p>
<h3 id="c143">關於鴉片 <a href="#c143" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e143" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">143</a></h3>
<p>— 白永</p>
<p>江寗李小池所作「鴉片事略」，與另一記洪楊故事的「思痛記」，是兩部不朽的名作，江寗雖不是鴉片進口處，而這第一次國職條約却締結於此，打破了二千年來以天朝自尊的信心，宜乎李氏憤而爲記。</p>
<p>頃讀張若谷編之馬相伯年譜，引陳樂素相老人八十年之經過談云：「吾生於道光二十年，到二十二年鴉片之戰，與英人訂約南京，恰是三歲。在鎭江北門城墻邊，有一家剃頭店，那時的風俗，大家拿了水烟袋吸水烟，有一天，那家的剃髮匠，因爲沒有貴客光臨，一個人拿了水烟袋，踱上城去很悠閒的散步，兩指中間，還夾一個紙吹，忽見城上有砲，裝好了藥綫，並沒有兵士看守，那位剃髮匠忽然高興起來，把手裏的紙吹，隨隨便便的往藥綫上一燃，說時遲，那時快，震天價一響，嚇得那剃髮匠沒命的飛跑，不知去向了；那年正是鴉片之戰，英國兵那時何等厲害，打進吳淞口，占了上海，又來打鎭江，剛巧那條船，停在江心，忽然一個砲彈，向桅竿旁擦過，船上軍官大吃一驚，暗想中國到底不好惹的，了不得，了不得，算罷！開向下遊去了。……這是後來吾的朋友楊谷山吿訴我的，他比我大八歲，是親見的呀！」</p>
<p>如果把這種故事寫到歷史裏邊，也就是書經金滕篇「反風，禾盡起」，或者史可法報多爾袞書所云「大江湧出楠梓數十萬章，助修宮室」，「祝文升書，紫雲如蓋」一類的「天與人歸」佳話了。相老人與楊君，那時皆是兒童，所見究如何，姑且不必談，但八十老人尙以是爲信史，我總以爲有些失敬。同書還有引劉成禺先生的「相老人九十八年聞見口授錄」記林文忠於海口設防云：「當時林文忠因燒鴉片，獲對外强硬之譽，實則未達外事，卒肇海衅。是役有一趣事，文忠於廣州城頭，排置大甕，僞爲巨砲，英人兵艦，以遠鏡測之，意爲中華大國，必有軍砲，懷疑而退，時赫德威安瑪二人，充英倫派華學士，通華語，在兵艦實習，謂中國無此互砲，定策窺探，夜趁月色，以小兵艦潛襲，對准甕口，發艦砲擊之，巨豐紛飛，英人大笑而入廣州。</p>
<p>林文忠即使不達敵情，亦尙不至荒唐如此，這豈不是三家村的齊東野語，或迂儒所設計時「夜壺陣」乎？梁延枬「夷氛紀聞」，記林氏一到廣東，先調查海口形勢，砲台位置，列具圖說，並買西洋大砲二百餘尊，分設口門各台，何至以巨變充數？後來戰事發生，林氏並創火船之法，乘月黑潮退，出夷船不意，分起潛出，趁上風攻其首尾，火器皆從桅擲下，使夷船維脫，英船受挫者很多，尤足證明林氏不是迂腐書生，而是精於戰術者。且那時英人也未曾攻入省城，排甕之說，自是附會。倒是後來林氏調走，換了琦善，把湖南提餐老將楊芳派到廣州禦敵，却眞的鬧了馬桶陣大笑話，前書頁三八（北平研究院拙印本，商務版）云：「芳之始至，道佛山口入，民聾其宿將，望之如歲，所到歡呼不絕，官亦羣倚爲長城。入城即發議謂夷砲恒中我，而我不能中夷，我居在實地，而夷在風波搖蕩中，主客異形，安能操券者？比必有邪敎善術者伏其內，傳令甲保遍收所近婦女溺器爲厭勝具，載以木筏，出禦烏涌，使一副將領之，自部卒隔岸設伏，約聞已砲響，即舉筏齊列水涘，眠器口向賊來路，而後自抄出筏馬夾攻之，夷將至，舉筒鏡測筏縱橫排岸側，駛近而副將已望見旗幟先遁，筏上無一人，遂長驅直進。……」</p>
<p>兩個故事很相似，可能相老是傳聞之訛，就加到林文忠公身上去了。本來，那時像葉名琛式的人物太多，也不能怪後人之妄爲臆斷也。</p>

<p>王摩詰的畫，畫中有詩，陸放翁的詩，詩中有畫，一個成名畫人應有的修養，除開丹靑上造詣以外，應該讀萬卷書，行萬里路，因爲藝術是從情感生的，而情感的因素，交織着「體驗」和「觀察」，應着文心雕龍「原道」所載：「觀山則情滿於山，觀海則情滿於海」，抒藻揚芬，必然要借助江山的。無怪目擊時艱的放翁，要興「勳業文章興已闌，暮年不足是看山」的感慨。詩言志，書寫情，藝術的最高境界，畢竟是殊途同歸。</p>
<p>賀天健先生以畫師而具備文人和藝人的雙重條件，國內的名山大川，他幾乎跑遍了，他的畫是積理和實驗而來的，生平重操守而不取巧，有人說他是脫胎於荆關董巨的，我郤不敢說，讓讀畫的人到大新畫廳去體味吧。（方子川）</p>

<p>去年舊都之浙江同鄉循例公祭其省之光賢祠。一人忽攫一鄕賢神脾擲地而踏碎之，衆人不驚不阻且視若當然，蓋此神脾王式通，字書衡，乃王蔭泰之父，子旣以奸逆入獄，父不得受鄉人之聲香禮拜也。謔者謂此確合於舊式計聞開首之例詞「不孝罪孽深重，不自殞減，禍延顯考」眞是趣劇的悲劇。按事理言，父子罪不相及，即前代之大逆犯，如雍正時年羹堯案，刑官初議其父年遐齡速坐，某大臣力爭謂遐齡實不知情，且朝廷以孝治大下，豈可因子而刑父，遐論遂得免罪。况王式通在七七事變之前數年即已去世，與蔭泰之任僞職，更不相十。則其神脾之應否以奸罪牽連而打倒，自有研究之餘地。識者以爲問題不在蔭泰之逆不逆，而在式通之「賢」的程度，與入詞之資格。</p>
<p>按祠祀所以崇德報功，永爲後人所景行瞻仰，成爲一種之模範。故必有出類拔萃之表見，爲輿情所佩服，而後有以安其憲，固其位。又按前代祠祀大別有二：（一）出於朝廷之榮典者，如「配享太廟」，如「入祀賢良」，皆以君主之諭旨獨斷獨行，士民無從過問，亦漠不關心。（二）出於衆論所推戴者，如「鄉賢」，如「名宦」，其人祀資格見於學政全書，即：一須有明德卓行，名實相副，衆議僉符；」「若所舉不實，地方官與禀報紳祫均有處分。」故光緒五年，皖人假借王蔭樾名義領銜爲前四川總督吳棠呈請入鄕賢祠，王蔭樾由浙江飛禀皖撫云，本人遠宦，並不在省，此事未嘗與知，皖撫據以入奏，成爲笑談。此外地方大更身後，一部分當地官紳請記名宦而被京官紳士奏辦撤銷之案，不一而足，蓋鄉賢必有坊表羣倫之道德學業，名宦須有實惠及民之治績，不可以勢位或私人情誼勉强而爲。</p>
<p>王式通原名儀通，（後因避溥儀名改儀爲式），著迹山西汾陽，原籍浙紹，濟光緒辛卯舉人戊戌進士，由刑部主事仕至大理院推事推丞，民國入老袁之總統府爲秘書，後繼張一鷹爲機要局長。此人在前淸時受知於張百熙，應辦學務，張與袁乃兒女親家。袁之賞識老王，只以其文牘穩練，遇事謹愼，略知掌故，可備器使，與梁士詒策畫政局之秘書長固不相同。此後又做過水利局長之閒曹，其子蔭泰留學歐洲，漸已成立，民國十六年且受張作霖之提拔而爲外交總長，老王退隱優游，老於牑下，綜其一生，够不上一奸」，亦設不到「賢」。蔭泰憑藉勢位，捧之入祠，在彼亦算行孝之一道，實則非徒無益，即使沒有奸逆問題，沒有打倒神牌的趣劇，亦難免鄕人之白眼相加；故曰錯在入詞之時。</p>

<h3 id="e1">An Honest Analysis of the Crisis Before Makeup; Striving to Break Open a Stagnant Situation; Weng Wenhao Reports on Administration in the Legislative Yuan <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 11th Dispatch] The ninth meeting of the first session of the Legislative Yuan was held on the 11th. The meeting commenced at 9:15 AM, presided over by President Sun. After all report items were completed one by one, emergency motions were passed by Wang Puhan, Cheng Tianfang, and others regarding the order of questions to be asked after hearing the Executive Yuan's report on administration. This order involved general reviews of national defense and military affairs, financial and economic issues, diplomatic matters, and other issues. At 9:50 AM, Premier of the Executive Yuan Weng Wenhao delivered his first report on administration since taking office, the full text of which was over 10,000 characters. Weng adopted a calm attitude, honestly analyzing the current administrative crisis. He stated with a firm tone that he would resolutely shoulder this heavy responsibility and break open the long-stagnant political situation. He also emphasized that strengthening the strength to suppress bandits was his primary goal at present.</p>
<p>Weng first emphasized the seriousness of the national situation, stating that reform and governance were the consistent expectations of the people. The Executive Yuan would administer according to the Constitution and national policy, and the most important task at present was suppressing the rebellion to stop the Communist bandits' attempts to engage in political strife using armed force. In military affairs, the government was determined to strengthen the defense of the Northeast and North China, improve the treatment of soldiers, boost morale, clarify conscription, and support local armed forces. The goal was to ensure that everyone recognized that protecting their homes and suppressing the Communists was the greatest contribution that people could make to the country. He was unwilling and unable to answer when the entire task of suppressing the rebellion could be completed. However, he said that if it could be quelled within two years, it would be an excellent achievement. All other administrative measures would be coordinated with the suppression of the rebellion. The government was determined to use a clean and capable government to get through this serious time. The budget would still be divided into ordinary and special parts. The special part was almost entirely the raising and expenditure of military funds. Food for the people could rely on American aid, but military grain would still have to be requisitioned and borrowed. However, the government would strive to make the process simple and reliable to avoid disturbing the people.</p>
<h3 id="e2">Strengthening Local Organizations to Coordinate with Military Suppression of the Rebellion; Reforming the Currency System with Careful Consideration of Effective Measures <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>In terms of internal affairs, the strengthening of local organizations was of paramount importance. The draft of the General Rules for Provincial and County Self-Government was being carefully studied. The effectiveness of local governments must be improved to ensure that government orders are implemented and to flexibly coordinate with military affairs to assist in suppressing the rebellion. In terms of finance, taxation was the mainstay of revenue. Both the system and tax regulations needed to be actively improved. The principle of "those with money should contribute money" must be established. First, the situation of large properties should be clarified, the regulations on the use of names should be strictly implemented, and property should be registered. Then, targets should be determined, procedures should be simplified, and property taxes, income taxes, inheritance taxes, etc., should be effectively collected. This would ensure that large cities where wealth is concentrated could also fulfill their tax obligations. Tax regulations would be calculated favorably, and inefficient tax collection agencies would be resolutely reduced. In terms of expenditure, government agencies should be effectively tightened or merged, and these vacancies should be used to place people in areas where talent is lacking and projects are waiting to be developed, and to provide relief to the unemployed. The reform of the currency system involves too much, and careful consideration must be given to a sound, easy-to-implement, and most effective method. The issuance of bonds must first establish credibility in order to absorb floating capital, stabilize the market, and reduce smuggling. In terms of economics, exports of Taiwan sugar, cement, cotton yarn, and cotton cloth should be added to foreign trade, and the quantity should also be increased. The application of political force and the awakening of patriotism should be used to eliminate smuggling. Overseas Chinese should be encouraged to increase the remittance of cash to balance expenditures.</p>
<h3 id="e3">Solving the Price Problem Through Supply and Allocation <a href="#e3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>The problem of prices will be solved through sufficient supply and universal allocation. The adjustment of the selling prices of public enterprises should be reasonable and gradual to avoid stimulating general prices. In terms of construction, three key tasks are being prepared to be launched in the shortest possible time: (1) Industrial production and transportation construction. After the victory, the industries and mines, and transportation in North and Northeast China were repeatedly damaged by Communist troops. Future construction can only open up the situation with great difficulty and will be planned and carried out in accordance with the policy of suppressing the rebellion. Reports of the southward relocation of industries are purely rumors. The government still plans to replenish machinery and raw materials for the industries in the war zones. However, to ensure the security of the South and the recovery of the North, a foundation should be laid early in the Jiangnan region. Therefore, the transportation capacity of the Yuehan and Zhegan railways and the construction of the coast and Taiwan must be strengthened, especially the textile industry, which has already achieved considerable scale, should be helped to obtain raw cotton to avoid stagnation. (2) Land registration and distribution. Rent reduction and land consolidation in the liberated areas have been underway for a long time. In the future, we will continue to design and implement sound measures based on the national land policy to solve the land problem and make the international community recognize that the Communist bandits' so-called land policy is actually reckless behavior. (3) Improvement of agricultural production. Our country is based on agriculture, but this does not contradict the development of industry. The improvement of agricultural production relies especially on the application of industry, the full supply of water conservancy, fertilizers, and mechanical farm implements, which are important means to increase production and save labor.</p>
<h3 id="e4">Diplomacy Still Based on Consistent National Policy <a href="#e4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>In terms of diplomacy, we will still adhere to our consistent national policy, with seeking world peace through the United Nations as the primary task. We will continue to strengthen friendly relations with all countries, especially the United States. Regarding policy toward Japan, we are determined to adhere to our established position. Military aggression must be eradicated, while industries necessary for the people's livelihood can be retained. At the same time, we are determined not to see it turn red. We can agree with any Allied country whose views on the Japanese issue are similar to ours; otherwise, we will oppose them. As for the emerging countries of Asia, our country will befriend them. If India, with its large population, unites with our country, it will ultimately be able to promote world peace. The effectiveness of American aid is divided into two parts according to its nature. One part is material goods, which can help us reduce imports, and the sales price can also bring back legal currency. The other part is loans, which can help the restoration of our agricultural and industrial production and construction. The way it is used still applies to the ten principles personally formulated by President Zhang. We will strengthen the work to make it a reality. Educational and cultural facilities need to be strengthened. In recent years, the Communist Party has made extensive use of students, affecting the stability of social order in the rear. Therefore, in addition to normal cultural and educational work, we must pay attention to ideological education. Finally, Weng stated that those responsible for administration are determined to work tirelessly and hope that, in addition to having a consistent goal for constitutional governance, the Legislative Yuan can also work together to carry out the work of suppressing the rebellion and achieve complete success.</p>
<h3 id="e5">Legislators Enthusiastically Question; Incisive Remarks Are Frequently Seen; Continuing the Questioning at the Tenth Meeting Today <a href="#e5" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c5" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">5</a></h3>
<p>Weng's report ended at 11:10 AM, lasting one hour and twenty minutes. President Sun then announced that, according to the provisions of Chapter 9 of the Rules of Procedure, the Legislative Yuan could immediately raise questions after listening to the report on administration. Those requesting to speak were very enthusiastic. Everyone should have the opportunity to speak on this important national matter. With the consent of the audience, the questioning should proceed until it is completed, and if it is not completed in one day, it will continue for another day. After a break, President Sun again appealed to the audience to be patient for the sake of democracy. Questioning began at 11:40 AM. The morning session adjourned at 12:30 PM, and the afternoon session was also extended to 6:30 PM. A total of 23 people asked questions orally, and more than ten people submitted written opinions. Those requesting to speak were still coming in an endless stream at the time of adjournment. The meeting proceeded tensely and enthusiastically, and incisive remarks were frequently seen. Lai Lian, Gu Zhengding, Du Guangxun, Xiao Zheng, Chen Shaojin, Zhang Qianhua, Cheng Tianfang, Sun Guiji, and others successively raised general reviews. Many believed that Weng's report was smooth and considered all aspects, but in reality, it was empty. Chen Ming said that the goal was to hope how to achieve it, but the policies and methods for its realization were not specifically proposed. Lai Lian also pointed out that the military suppression of the rebellion has been failing in recent years. How will military affairs be strengthened in the future? How will troops be used? How will the treatment of soldiers be improved? The recent surge in prices can be seen as a challenge to the new government. How will it be dealt with? Will the diplomatic policy continue the incompetent style, or will it be newly formulated? The front line is suppressing bandits, and the rear is experiencing student unrest. Are there any appropriate and effective measures? He said: Premier Weng's appointment in the face of danger is admirable. Although the Legislative Yuan has reluctantly agreed, it will be difficult to win the trust of the people if no solutions are produced. Gu Zhengding pointed out that the current local organization is not competent, and local leaders lack standards. He then asked why the suppression of the rebellion does not thoroughly rectify the grassroots level that is creating Communist bandits. As for diplomatic policy, suppressing the rebellion means being anti-communist, so why continue to vacillate in the future? Xiao Zhong asked (1) What will be used to suppress the rebellion? Simply relying on military affairs without the Three People's Principles is all empty talk. (2) What policies will be used to stabilize prices? Will the policy of issuing currency continue to balance the budget? (3) How will local administration be strengthened? Will military personnel continue to be appointed to preside over provincial affairs? (4) Agriculture, forestry, industry, and commerce are extremely important. Why are you giving official positions to party members, leaving no one to take responsibility? Chen Shaojin emphasized that the administrative policies in Weng's report did not take into account the timing, resulting in an emphasis on heavy topics, and accused the Executive Yuan of having no progress in suppressing the rebellion and lacking confidence. Zhang Qianhua said that since the Weng Cabinet has not escaped the old circle of personnel, it is difficult to expect any action. Why not refresh the people's ears and eyes in the use of personnel and work hard to govern? Cheng Tianfang also pointed out that the administrative policies lacked timeliness, progress, and specific measures. A six-month administrative target should be pre-established to show how efficient it is. Sun Guiji criticized the errors in Weng's report from a conceptual point of view. (1) Emphasizing South China as the foundation for suppressing the rebellion may disturb the people of the North. (2) Land reform does not extend to the rear. Is the government's land policy only implemented after the Communist bandits destroy the rear? (3) How can the report ignore the employment issue? Relief is not a fundamental way to stabilize society. (4) The United States' support for Japan should be emphasized. How can we not investigate the current situation in Japan and report to the country? How can we not strive for the compensation from Japan that we deserve and instead borrow from the United States and ask for help? In addition, Pan Chaoying, Qiu Hanping, Wu Shangying, and others all raised the issue of overseas remittances and the protection of overseas Chinese. Wu Fu questioned why the Minister of National Defense is still a military person and asked whether there are any measures to eliminate military factions and cliques, clarify rewards and punishments, and rectify military discipline. Ma Chengfeng, Chen Yiyun, Du Guangxun, Zhao Pei, Wang Puhan, and others all requested explanations on the specific measures of military actions. Gao Tingzi raised the issue of how to stabilize prices and when to reform the currency system. Li Yaolin suggested that the Executive Yuan should find out what obstacles past failures encountered and how they can be eliminated. Jian Guansan said that the new cabinet, from the President down, is mostly made up of people with expertise in industry. What measures do they have for economic construction? They should bring them out. Xu Zhongqi, Zhao Huimo, and others all questioned what measures would be taken to deal with the soaring prices. All questioning was conducted by alternating oral statements with the reading of written opinions. Premier Weng and the heads of various ministries and commissions also sat quietly on both sides of the platform all day, listening and taking notes at all times. At the time of adjournment, President Sun announced that there were more than one hundred people waiting to speak, which would be left to the continuation of the meeting on the 12th for further questioning, and then adjourned the meeting.</p>
<p>[Another Telegram] The Legislative Yuan held its tenth meeting on the 12th to continue questioning the Executive Yuan's report on administrative policy. If there is sufficient time, Premier Weng or the heads of relevant ministries and commissions will first give some oral answers.</p>

Premier Weng Wenhao is currently looking for new committee members and hopes to establish it within this month.

<h3 id="e10">Hoffman Asks Congress to Restore the Original Amount of Aid to China; Lapham Also Says that Reducing It Is Like Going Back on Our Word <a href="#e10" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c10" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">10</a></h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 10th Dispatch] Economic Cooperation Administration Director Hoffman today asked Congress to restore the original amount of $463 million for the aid to China plan. He believes that the House of Representatives' reduction of $63 million and extension of three months will seriously endanger the plan to combat the Chinese Communist Party. Hoffman's statement was read by Cheng Er, special assistant to the Economic Cooperation Administration, to the Senate Appropriations Committee. Hoffman said: The aid to China plan aims to enable the Chinese government to overcome inflation and make the necessary urgent tasks to defeat the Communist bandits. He pointed out that Lapham has arrived in China and is only waiting for a firm implementation plan to review various needs and stipulate the content of the organization. Hoffman listed the various difficulties faced by the aid to China plan in the rapid changes of finance and economy caused by the civil war. He said that China needs more personnel than European countries. The basic reason for the situation in China is that the long-term destruction by the Japanese invaders and the Communist bandits and the extensive struggle have led to increasingly severe inflation. China relies on imports to maintain its economy, but inflation and other factors have reduced its exports and dollar remittances, thereby reducing China's ability to pay for imports. Hoffman said that American aid alone cannot help China solve various difficulties, but it can only delay the extent of its economic deterioration. Hoffman finally pointed out that when the House of Representatives reduced $60 million, it did not specify whether this reduction was calculated from military funds.</p>
<p>[This City News] Lapham told reporters who visited him yesterday about the House of Representatives' reduction of aid to Europe and China, saying: He supports Vandenberg's opinion and hopes that Congress will not reduce the aid. Lapham said: We have promised various countries and China. Now, if we reduce it, it is like going back on our word.</p>
<p>Lapham then talked about his meeting with President Chiang in Nanjing, saying: He told President Chiang that the task of this trip is to comply with the guidance of the US Congress and require the cooperation of the Chinese government to implement the aid to China plan. He said that President Chiang agreed to this point.</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper News] It is learned that Lapham's current work in Shanghai, in addition to contacting relevant parties in our country, focuses on internal organizational matters. Since Lapham came to China alone, the composition of the American aid agency in the future will mostly use the staff of the China Relief Mission. Lapham and the investigation team moved into the Dangsted Research Institute, the original site of the China Relief Mission, yesterday. After returning to Shanghai from Nanjing yesterday afternoon, Governor of the Central Bank Yu Hongjun immediately visited Lapham to discuss various issues related to American aid, and left after about an hour.</p>
<p>The Stillman Investigation Team is about to depart, and the time for the investigation in South China is scheduled for three months. After the matter is completed, they will return to the country to report.</p>

<p>[United States Information Service, Washington, 10th Dispatch] Army Chief Royall told the Senate Appropriations Committee on the 10th that the State Department has drafted a plan to supervise American military aid to China.

Royall said that this plan would require the Chinese authorities to submit invoices for purchases and show the actual use of the funds before payment could be made. Royall said that of the $125 million in non-economic funds recommended for aid to China, $87.5 million will be handled by the US Army, $28 million by the Air Force, and $9.5 million by the Navy.</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 11th Dispatch] The National Army of Western Shandong launched an attack on the morning of the 10th and recaptured Shan County by noon.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Xuzhou, 11th Dispatch] The outskirts of Yanzhou are becoming increasingly tense. Parts of the 7th and New 8th Columns of the Communist bandits attacked the outskirts of Yanzhou and Qufu on the 11th, and another force rushed towards Wenshang. Under the command of the famous general Li Yutang, the National Army in various places gave the bandits a head-on blow and launched fierce battles.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Jinan, 11th Dispatch] The Battle of Yanzhou, which has been brewing for many days, opened on the evening of the 9th. At the moment, the battles on the outskirts of Yanzhou, Wenshang, and Qufu are all proceeding fiercely. The bandits besieging Qufu launched a fierce attack on the city walls all day on the 10th. After the National Army calmly endured the pain, they did not succeed. On the morning of the 11th, a large formation of Air Force planes sortieed from Jinan and cooperated with the National Army in the air over Yanzhou and Qufu to fiercely attack the stubborn bandits.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Kaifeng, 11th Dispatch] In order to cover the harvesting of wheat, the National Army and local forces in northern Henan have launched extensive attacks in recent days, successively recovering counties and towns such as Fengqiu, Yanjin, Qixian, and Daokou, reaching the suburbs of Hua and Jun counties, and annihilating half of the main force of three regiments of bandits reorganized from local Communists near Xiaodong Village, east of Wuzhi. The county magistrates of Fengqiu and Yanjin have returned to their counties to work.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Jinan, 11th Dispatch] The large formation of the Air Force stationed in Jinan, despite the Dragon Boat Festival, still braved the extremely bad weather and flew along the Yellow River through Pingyin, Dong'e, Shouzhang, Fanxian, Guancheng, and Huaixian to destroy the bandits' ferries, docks, ships, and accumulated materials along the river. Then, they flew from Puyang County over Yuncheng and Juye, bombing and strafing the places where the bandits were gathered along the way. The bandits suffered heavy losses. Then, they flew back from Wenshang to Yanzhou, strafing the bandits who were running to Dalucun in eastern Yanzhou and Qufu. It is estimated that at least 2,000 bandits were killed or wounded.</p>
<p>The Bandits Attempting to Attack Chengde Began to Retreat</p>

<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 11th Dispatch] While the Legislative and Control Yuans are holding meetings, the Examination Yuan will also be reorganized in accordance with the Constitution. The President, Vice President, and members of the Examination Yuan will be nominated by the President and appointed after being approved by the Control Yuan. The Examination Committee and the Ministry of Personnel, which originally belonged to the Yuan, will also be reorganized into the Ministry of Examinations in accordance with the new Organic Law of the Examination Yuan. According to the Organic Law of the Examination Yuan of the Constitutional Government, which was amended and promulgated in December 1947, the Yuan should have 19 Examination Committee members and set up the Ministry of Examinations and the Ministry of Personnel. The task of the Examination Committee members in the future will be an expansion of the task of the current Examination Committee members, comprehensively coordinating matters related to examinations, including the design and drafting of important laws and regulations related to fundamental issues of examination and personnel management. In the future, the Constitution stipulates that civil servants shall not be appointed unless they pass the examination. If personnel are appointed, the examination work will inevitably become more cumbersome, and the "overall coordination of examination matters" by the Examination Committee members will focus on the original part of the examination. It is learned that the Examination Yuan recently submitted the resumes of the current Examination Committee members to the President. According to general speculation, although the selection of Examination Committee members will inevitably include people from the Min and Qing parties and non-party people, it will also attach importance to experts in various subjects who are familiar with the current system in order to match their specialized tasks.

<p>[Our Newspaper Dihua, 10th] The 10th marks the first anniversary of the Beitashan Incident. The national army stationed at Beitashan has spent a year in a harsh and difficult environment. Recalling this day last year, it was precisely when the enemy used fierce joint air and ground firepower to launch a surprise attack on our garrison. Ultimately, thanks to the steadfast and courageous fighting of our loyal soldiers, we defended our national territory and held our position. Today, this reporter made a special visit to General Ma Chengxiang, the cavalry commander who recently inspected the defense of Beitashan. He informed me that since the incident, there have been six fierce battles in total. The enemy ultimately failed. Since the beginning of last winter, Beitashan has been subjected to severe cold. Although the enemy has temporarily stopped attacking our garrison, there is no sign of withdrawal. Therefore, our garrison must prepare for long-term stationing. We completed cold-weather equipment before winter, built underground barracks, stables, and clubs to stabilize the lives of officers and soldiers. General Ma praised the hard work and endurance of the Beitashan garrison, saying that it is truly commendable that they have fought hard in the harsh mountains for a year without a single sick soldier or weakened horse. The reporter continued to ask if there was a possibility of war breaking out in Beitashan recently. General Ma emphatically replied to the reporter: The war began a year ago. The Mongolian cavalry that invaded our territory 600 li beyond the border has only increased, not decreased. They are now actively strengthening rear transportation and building defensive fortifications, confronting us under Beitashan. The crisis threatening peace in Xinjiang has not been resolved. As for combat, it can occur at any time. In short, unless the Outer Mongolian troops withdraw from our territory, the border defense of Xinjiang will not be secure for a single day.</p>

<h3 id="e24">Starting with the New Cabinet's Policy Guidelines <a href="#e24" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c24" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">24</a></h3>
<p>Premier Weng has submitted a report to the Legislative Yuan yesterday regarding the new cabinet's policy guidelines. This is not only the linchpin of the relationship between the Legislative Yuan and the Executive Yuan, but also the focus of attention from people at home and abroad. After the new cabinet was formed on the first of this month, some people in society thought that there were too many old faces in the new cabinet, and that old figures could not implement new policies. Therefore, they made many dissatisfied criticisms of the new cabinet. However, most people still held an attitude of expectation towards the new cabinet before the policy guidelines were published, hoping that Premier Weng could come up with new ways to reverse the current crisis.</p>
<p>However, Premier Weng's policy report to the Legislative Yuan yesterday was not only a boilerplate but also empty, ordinary, and lacking any sign of new policies. It was simply a continuation of the previous cabinet. The new cabinet was already criticized for having too many old faces in terms of ministerial candidates, with only three or four changes. In terms of policy guidelines, it is the same old tune of the previous cabinet. How can this satisfy the national expectation of "using new people to implement new policies," and how can it meet the "desire for change" in the general public! Therefore, after Premier Weng's report, many legislators raised questions and expressed dissatisfaction, subjecting the Weng cabinet to an even more serious test.</p>
<p>According to the current domestic situation, suppressing the rebellion and building the nation is the national consensus, and no one can oppose it. Therefore, the central problem of the current situation revolves around the two key points of military affairs and economy. Suppressing the rebellion and building the nation can be said to be a military problem, and it can also be said to be an economic problem. During this period, the focus of any government's policies must be concentrated on these two issues. Furthermore, judging from the current actual situation in the country, military affairs and economy have become two sides of the same coin, often mutually influencing each other. Military setbacks on the front lines will undoubtedly deepen the economic crisis; economic disorder in the rear will also deepen the military crisis. Therefore, if these two problems need to be reformed, they must be reformed simultaneously with a two-pronged approach. Today's Weng cabinet is also the first cabinet after the implementation of the constitution in our country. Its current task is not only to clean up the old situation but also to create a new one. The responsibilities it bears are particularly heavy. But in practice, the focus of the new cabinet's policies should still be concentrated on these two issues. In other words, if the military situation can improve and the economy can stabilize, then other problems will not be difficult to solve. When we comment on the new cabinet and examine its policy guidelines, we don't need to discuss other things, as long as we see how the new cabinet can overcome military difficulties and economic crises, we can judge its success or failure.</p>
<p>Let's take a look at the new cabinet's policy guidelines. Regarding military affairs, the new cabinet plans to take the following measures: (1) continue to strengthen military strength; (2) improve soldiers' treatment; (3) unite morale; (4) support local armed forces; and give full play to the local security forces to assist the national army in suppressing the rebellion. Regarding the economy: (1) make good use of American aid, on the one hand, use American materials to stabilize prices, and on the other hand, use American loans to increase production; (2) strive for economic construction, but still prioritize adapting to the needs of suppressing the rebellion; (3) regarding the budget, make the regular budget as balanced as possible, and make the special budget based on the needs of the war, and continue to collect grain and taxes, and levy property taxes to make up for the shortfall in revenue and expenditure; (4) in terms of finance, increase revenue and reduce expenditure, in addition to strengthening tax collection, we should also save expenses, and implement currency reform according to actual needs; (5) in terms of finance, continue to strengthen control; (6) in terms of agriculture, on the one hand, implement land reform and redistribute land, and on the other hand, strive to improve production technology to increase production.</p>
<p>From the above policy guidelines, we can't find any signs of new policies. However, a government should not talk too much, but only strive to do its best. Before the war, Premier Weng participated in the government as a scholar, responsible for developing resources. During the war, he presided over the Ministry of Economic Affairs and the Wartime Production Board. After the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, he served as Vice President of the Executive Yuan and Chairman of the Resources Committee. He has made outstanding achievements in important positions and has always been admired by people at home and abroad. Premier Weng is a practical scientist who does not like empty talk. He would not ignore reality and sing high-sounding tunes. Therefore, we should not be disappointed because Premier Weng's policy guidelines did not raise the tone. If Premier Weng can be pragmatic and do what he says, it will not be difficult to turn the entire situation around in two or three months.</p>
<p>Although we cannot deny that the Weng cabinet itself is fragile, and Premier Weng himself is a simple and unpretentious scientist, it is not easy for him to deal with five or six hundred legislators. However, analyzing the current situation, the Weng cabinet is worthy of our people's support. The next month or two is the most difficult period for the Weng cabinet, when things are in a state of transition. If it can safely overcome the difficulties with the support of the people, the position of the Weng cabinet will become stronger day by day. Therefore, today, we should enthusiastically encourage the new cabinet, and in the national atmosphere of dissatisfaction, redouble our efforts, on the one hand, strive for self-reliance, and on the other hand, make good use of American aid. As long as we have a plan and the courage to act, we can reverse the economic crisis and overcome military difficulties in two or three months. The current criticisms from the people are not yet the final conclusion on the success or failure of the Weng cabinet!</p>
<h3 id="e25">Establishment Day of the Shanghai Branch of the China Industrial Management Association, Zhuang Zhihuan and Others Express Their Views <a href="#e25" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c25" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">25</a></h3>
<p>The organization of the China Industrial Management Association was established last year in the capital. The promotion of association affairs and work procedures have been determined one by one. The Shanghai branch has been actively preparing and is already showing signs of success. Today is the day of the general assembly. Mr. Zhuang Zhihuan and Mr. Xia Zonghui specially expressed their grand views and submitted them to this newspaper for publication. It is deeply believed that it will arouse the interest and attention of people in the industrial and academic circles to the issue of management, and seek improvement in implementation. (Editor)</p>
<p>Mr. Zhuang Zhihuan first expressed his views on industrial management and industrial construction in our country as follows:</p>
<p>The research object of industrial management is to further explore how to obtain the highest efficiency of organization, management, and coordination of human resources and machinery in addition to technological improvement. Its main content can include four parts: The first is the management of production, the goal is to maintain mass production and product standardization. The second is the management of finance, the goal is to rationally operate capital to reduce costs and increase profits. The third is personnel management, the goal is to improve the quality and work efficiency of employees, so that people are suitable for their jobs and jobs are suitable for their people. The fourth is motion study, the goal is to review various actions in each production process, to make them reasonable, fast, save time, and reduce fatigue, thereby maximizing work efficiency and production capacity. Motion study is the latest subject of industrial management. It must be based on human physiological conditions, psychological conditions, and the general and special performance of various machines, and even various factors of each action, to conduct in-depth and objective research and analysis before designing new, more reasonable production procedures, production methods, and production tools.</p>
<p>Industrial management has been introduced to our country in the past two decades. However, due to the traditional conservative concepts, and the extremely low cost of labor in the past, and the lack of fierce market competition, although the general public attaches great importance to modern production equipment and technology, they lack an understanding of the important value of industrial management. In fact, modern production equipment and production technology must be matched with modern management methods and management systems. Otherwise, even with the same machines and technicians as Europe and the United States, the products produced will never be able to compare with Europe and the United States in terms of quality, quantity, manufacturing cost, or overall work efficiency. If our country wants to promote industrialization, the principle of equal emphasis on technology and management must be confirmed first. In the past, due to low labor costs, traditional rural handicrafts have continued to linger, and modern industrial production has not been able to develop soundly. However, if this wasteful style of labor and time is not thoroughly reformed, industrial construction will never succeed. In order to transform agricultural society into an industrial society, it is necessary to eliminate the phenomenon of negative production in the past. American wages are high, so it is necessary to rely on modern management methods. The high general wages in our country today are far from comparable to the past. Therefore, when it comes to industrial construction today, it is impossible to succeed without emphasizing industrial management, so as to reduce manufacturing costs and improve production efficiency. I am delighted to hear that the Shanghai branch of the China Industrial Management Association has been formally established. I would like to briefly present my expectations and express my slight congratulations:</p>
<p>First, launch research on industrial management theory: Industrial management is a discipline created by industrially advanced countries. To transplant it to China, it must go through a process of cultivation. How can we avoid blindly copying foreign countries, and make the theory closely match the practice? This is what awaits our joint efforts.</p>
<p>Second, promote the training of industrial management talents: The cultivation of industrial management talents is undoubtedly the top priority in the future. However, at present, only Jiaotong University in our country has a Department of Industrial Management, which is obviously insufficient for the needs of future industrial construction. In addition, general engineering personnel must also recognize the indivisibility of management and technology, and promote the all-round talents with both the conditions of engineering talents and industrial talents, which is what we must strive for.</p>
<p>Mr. Xia Zonghui believes that industrial manufacturing is complex and the scope of management requires careful consideration. He further divides the tasks and scope of the management work implementation objects into the following ten points according to the manufacturing process and order, and describes their outlines as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Capital allocation: Capital is originally one of the factors of production. At the beginning of a business, the size of the enterprise and the scale of the factory are all based on the amount of capital. After the start of the business, the use and circulation of funds, the preparation of budgets, and other financial issues, such as the formulation of accounting systems and the calculation of costs, all require careful strategies and appropriate measures for overall planning to lay the foundation for the business.</p>
<p>(2) Plant layout: Consider the restrictions on the location of the factory based on the differences in manufacturing raw material origins, the types of transportation tools, the impact of climate on products, the supply of power and fuel, and the level of labor costs. Other tasks, such as the manufacturing of the plant, the intensity of light, the adjustment of air, and the regulations on indoor colors, must be properly designed to obtain a good working environment and increase production efficiency.</p>
<p>(3) Machine arrangement: If the machines through which the product passes throughout the entire manufacturing process are continuous, the order and height of the machine arrangement must be properly arranged, so that the consumption of human energy and the time of transmission stagnation can be greatly reduced.</p>
<p>(4) Raw material procurement: If the economy is stable, prices will fluctuate significantly. The purchase of raw materials required for manufacturing does not necessarily require a large amount of storage. The determination of the quantity should be based on the production needs and turnover, and the determination of the accurate quantity should be calculated by formula.</p>
<p>(5) Use of human resources: Use people according to their abilities, each giving their best, using strengths to make up for weaknesses, so that it can be effective. The selection of intelligence should be assisted by the industrial psychology test to explore the equivalent of talent and intelligence, to adapt to the needs of the work and achieve the consequences of efficiency.</p>
<p>(6) Method improvement: Manufacturing becomes more complicated day by day, and methods change day by day. Innovation is the only way to progress. Based on past use, enlighten later evolution, and conduct precise research, so that there will be achievements.</p>
<p>(7) Motion study: When production begins, the movements of machines and human labor follow. According to general circumstances, in all the movements to complete a certain fixed task, there are always unnecessary movement fragments or accidental delays mixed in, which are often difficult to detect without careful analysis. The purpose of motion study is to obtain the two major achievements of time and work with simple movements and the lowest consumption of labor. The implementation of the research should have a variety of equipment and film analysis available for reference as a basis for improvement and experimentation.</p>
<p>(8) Product review: There are many kinds of products, with different qualities, shapes, and colors, and it takes a lot of effort to repair, trim, and add accessories. Therefore, the standardization and unification of product standards has been promoted in European and American countries for a long time, and has achieved great results. If the domestic industry seeks progress, it is urgent to catch up. Other packaging designs must be carefully considered, and the functions of use must also be clearly stated to facilitate sales.</p>
<p>(9) Market distribution: Market surveys, regional divisions, records of consumption patterns, analysis of customer psychology, and preparation of statistical tables must be carried out sequentially to make the final effort in production and sales work.</p>
<p>(10) Implementation of management: The work of each department has been planned, and the management of each part is particularly important for communication. In order to make the work of each department resonate and assist each other, and the transmission is smooth, there must be a comprehensive overall management to formulate systems, implement policies, and observe the effect, to complete the most important task of industrial management.</p>
<p>To sum up the above points, the complete task of industrial management can be described as follows: "Plan adequate funds, set up suitable factories and appropriate machines, add appropriate raw materials, use improved methods and reasonable actions, implement artificial simplification, sell superior products through hard work, and use scientific management to obtain the greatest production effect at the lowest cost."</p>

<p>[Reuters Berlin 10th] The "Berliner Zeitung," registered with the Soviet side, hinted that the last land route from the Western Allies to Berlin will be temporarily closed. It is generally expected that the Soviet Union will take new actions to make it impossible for the Western powers to maintain their position in Berlin. The newspaper stated that the road wooden bridge over the Elbe River near Magdeburg is in urgent need of repair. The bridge is essential for the highway from the West German occupation zone to Berlin. The bridge is hundreds of yards long, and repairs will take a long time. During the repair period, road traffic will inevitably be limited to a standstill. Yesterday, hundreds of German travelers traveling between Berlin and West Germany were blocked by the Soviet army in Helmstedt and turned back. It is generally believed that this is a countermeasure taken by the Soviet side in response to the British authorities' request to move the Berlin radio station out of the British sector of Berlin.</p>

<p>[Associated Press Washington 10th] The Senate passed the Peacetime Conscription Act today by a vote of 78 to 10, conscripting 200,000 men aged 19 to 25 into the army in the next year. The bill had already been placed in the bill procedure that must be decided before Congress recess, and was passed after a week of intense debate. It has now been sent to the House of Representatives. A similar bill is being blocked in the House Rules Committee and has been blocked for a month.</p>
<p>House Republican leaders say they will get the bill passed by the House before the scheduled June 19 recess.</p>
<p>The above-mentioned bill passed by the Senate has reduced the military manpower requested by President Truman. University military training has been cancelled, and the establishment of military strength will not exceed 1.956 million people.</p>
<p>After this bill is signed by the President, the wartime conscription mechanism will be restored. Within 60 days after this bill officially becomes law, all men aged 19 to 25 must register, but men aged 18 will not be conscripted unless they voluntarily receive 12 months of training. Then serve four years of reserve service, and may be granted exemption. The House bill completely allows men aged 18 to be exempted. The difference between the two House bills is that in the House terms, the president must be responsible for enforcement. The Senate bill grants exemptions to soldiers, government officials, civil servants, and theological students who participated in World War II.

<p>[Associated Press Washington 10th] The Far East Commission granted General MacArthur, Supreme Commander of the Allied Forces in Japan, full authority to send Japanese people abroad to participate in intergovernmental conferences on the 10th. This move is a victory for the United States and MacArthur, as some countries have argued that MacArthur's dispatch of Japanese people abroad must first be approved by the Far East Commission each time without success. The Far East Committee passed this resolution on the evening of the 9th and notified MacArthur on the 10th. According to the committee's information, this move will clearly lay the foundation for the Far East Committee to pass another proposal by the United States, which is to send Japanese people abroad to study and allow Japanese businessmen to go abroad. The Far East Committee's decision authorizes MacArthur to dispatch Allied Headquarters observers to attend intergovernmental conferences when invited to send representatives, and to dispatch Japanese technicians to accompany them. The only condition is that this move should obtain the permission of the country where the meeting is held for Japanese people to enter. The Far East Committee's decision only makes the temporary unilateral procedure that the United States has already taken official. And MacArthur is now using the same unilateral procedure based on the temporary orders of the US government to send Japanese businessmen abroad to perform economic tasks.</p>

<p>[Reported by Our Newspaper] Due to recent financial difficulties, the China Vegetable Oil Factory temporarily requested the People's Food Adjustment Committee to supply 1,800 dan of cooking oil for distribution to public school teachers for May, and will only distribute the physical goods, without issuing any monetary difference.

<h3 id="e67">Urging Payment of Salary Income Tax, Will Be Handled by the Court if Overdue <a href="#e67" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c67" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">67</a></h3>
<p>[Reported by Our Newspaper] The Municipal Direct Tax Bureau has decided that all salary income taxes must be paid in full by the end of June this year. However, there are still many who have not reported. For example, the salary income tax of performers in the drama industry has not been reported since the victory. This is because famous performers do not have fixed salaries, their mobility is quite high, and the income of famous performers actually includes the salaries of their accompanying staff, so although the reported income figures are very high, they differ greatly from actual income. Therefore, it is difficult to estimate. However, the Tax Bureau believes that there is no sufficient reason for those who delay paying taxes to refuse to pay. It has now been decided that all salary income taxes that have not been paid since the victory must be paid in full within the deadline. Any refusal or delay in payment will be transferred to the court for handling.</p>

<p>According to a statement issued by the Shanghai Committee for Comforting and Rewarding Troops Passing Through the City: The allegation that Liu Deming, president of the News Agency for Friends of the Military, used 3 billion yuan of funds for purchasing comfort meat to lend out for interest while serving as the director of the catering department of the committee for comforting and rewarding troops passing through the city is not true. Since the establishment of this committee in August of last year, all expenses and purchases of comfort meat have been jointly approved by Resident Chairman Fang and Mayor Wu, and then issued by the City Bank. There has never been a case of receiving such a large sum of money for lending out for interest. It is also inaccurate to say that Liu is the vice chairman of this committee and the captain of the Pacifying Rebellion and Building the Nation Propaganda Team. This statement is hereby issued."</p>

<p>[Reported by Our Newspaper] The financial revenue and expenditure situation of Shanghai in May has been fully compiled by the Finance Bureau. The revenue was over 849.2 billion yuan, and the expenditure was over 685.1 billion yuan. After offsetting the revenue and expenditure, the surplus reached over 164.1 billion yuan, breaking all previous records of the Finance Bureau. However, Director Tian told reporters yesterday that the sharp increase in tax revenue in May was actually the result of the Bureau's full efforts to collect taxes. Due to the Dragon Boat Festival, all units had to pay salaries in advance, so they had to save money in advance. However, after the salaries are paid out in June, a deficit of over 200 billion yuan is expected. Among the revenue items in May, business tax accounted for the largest portion, at over 290 billion yuan, followed by entertainment tax, at over 86.5 billion yuan, banquet tax again, at over 58.3 billion yuan, and slaughter tax at approximately 25.2 billion yuan.</p>

<p>[Reported by Our Newspaper] The City Government is dissatisfied with Jiaotong University's response to the school's student demonstration on June 5, "Opposing the United States Supporting Japan," and has sent another letter to Jiaotong University, inquiring on eight points. Jiaotong University formally received the City Government's official letter yesterday morning. According to President Cheng Xiaogang, he has turned it over to the relevant departments for handling and will reply to the City Government within days.</p>
<p>The Jiaotong University Student Union hosted reporters last night, responding to Mayor Wu's remarks about Jiaotong University the day before. They also published "An Open Letter to Mayor Wu" and "A Letter to the Elders of the Nation," questioning the mayor on ten points.</p>
<p>The content of Jiaotong University's first response to the City Government's inquiry is supplemented as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e76">Contents of Jiaotong University's Reply <a href="#e76" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c76" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">76</a></h3>
<p>Jiaotong University's reply to the City Government: We have received your official letter (Ji Shen Zi No. 4431) issued on June 5 of this year regarding the student-initiated class strike and demonstration case, instructing us to investigate and report on various points, which we should comply with. We have ordered the school's Dean of Students Office to strictly inquire with the student union representatives in accordance with the opinions in your letter. We have now received a written report from the student union, and excerpts of the responses to each point are as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Who requested action from the department representatives' conference beforehand?</p>
<p>Answer: In the department representatives' conference, sixteen classes (Electrical Engineering 3, Electrical Management 3, Chemistry 3, Physics 1, Transportation 3A, Transportation 3B, Transportation 1, Transportation 2A, Mechanical Engineering 2, Civil Engineering 4, Textile 2, Civil Engineering 3A, Hydraulic Engineering 2, Industrial Engineering 1, Industrial Engineering 2, Construction 4) formally spoke and requested action, and the result was passed (records are available). The so-called action refers to general, broad action, including sending telegrams, issuing declarations, expanding publicity and demonstrations, etc., and does not specifically refer to demonstrations.</p>
<p>(2) Who advocated for a class strike and demonstration in the department representatives' conference?</p>
<p>Answer: In the department representatives' conference, five classes (Chemistry 3, Industrial Engineering 1, Transportation 3A, Electrical Engineering 3, Transportation 2A) formally spoke and proposed a demonstration, and the result was passed. There was no discussion of a class strike (records are available).</p>
<p>(3) Who proposed eating together at 11:00 AM and gathering on the Bund at 1:00 PM in the department representatives' conference?</p>
<p>Answer: Having a meal at 11:00 AM (not eating together) was decided by the joint meeting of the student union and the National Jiaotong University Committee Against the United States Supporting Japan and Rescuing the National Crisis, and it was not decided to gather on the Bund at 1:00 PM.</p>
<p>(4) The department representatives' conference started at 3:00 PM and ended at 5:00 PM. When was contact made with the 120 organizations in this city to decide to depart at the same time and gather on the Bund?</p>
<p>(5) If contact was made after the vote at 5:00 PM, what method was used to contact the 120 organizations so quickly? (This is an impossible fact).</p>
<p>Answer: At the May Fourth bonfire party jointly held by 120 schools in Shanghai, the "Shanghai Federation Against the United States Supporting Japan and Rescuing the National Crisis" was established. Later, at the May 22 memorial meeting, it was decided that each school would take active action and set a date for the demonstration. However, participation was to be decided by each school independently. The department representatives' conference of our school was convened based on the call of the Federation and the request of more than 600 students who signed their names.</p>
<p>(6) If contact was made with the organizations to take joint action before the department representatives' conference, who represented Jiaotong University? Where and with whom was contact made?</p>
<p>Answer: Before the department representatives' conference, no contact was made with other schools (not organizations) to take joint action in this demonstration. Before the establishment of the Anti-American and Support Japan Crisis Committee of our school, there was no fixed person to participate on behalf of the student union. It was handled by the staff member who had no class at the time (contacting the anti-American and support Japan committees of other schools).</p>
<p>(7) What are the names of the 120 organizations? Who is in charge?</p>
<p>Answer: The name of the 120 organizations is the "Shanghai Student Federation Against the United States Supporting Japan and Rescuing the National Crisis." The chair is taken by each school in turn. According to the student report, the names of the 118 schools are all major and secondary schools in this city, and they stated that only a small number of students participated and could not represent the entire body. Our school believes that since this report cannot determine the participating school units, it is not appropriate to relay it to avoid damaging the reputation of other schools and causing our school to bear unnecessary responsibility. In response to the previous letter, we are now sending a letter with the results of the investigation, hoping that you will take appropriate action. Sincerely, Cheng Xiaogang, President of Jiaotong University.</p>

<h3 id="e81">A Virtuous Man Who Donated a Ship Lives in a Tiny Room, Ten Years of Poverty and Illness with Intermittent Meals; People from All Walks of Life Send Letters to Pay Their Respects <a href="#e81" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c81" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">81</a></h3>
<p>[Reported by Our Newspaper] Wang Zhongying, who lives in a dilapidated attic in Hong'anfang on Shaanxi South Road, has become a legendary figure since unconditionally donating the Xin'an, a ship worth US$100,000. He is an object of visits by people from all walks of life. People from all walks of life, such as primary school students, civil servants, Christians, Buddhists, and soldiers, have sent letters to pay their respects to him. Someone from Pu Yi Road, who has suffered greatly from family disputes, is said to have recently visited Wang in person and intends to unconditionally donate his private property. When the reporter met with Wang, he expressed his gratitude for the comfort from all walks of life and said that he would be especially happy if more people could follow his example. The Qingdao Yingji Shipping Company and the Shanghai Office are currently being liquidated by Wang Youji. All approximately 11 or 12 employees will be given generous severance pay. Hu Baosan, the deputy manager of the company, has recently come to Shanghai from Qingdao to discuss everything. All crew members on the Xin'an will be retained by the Ying Jizi Charity Fund Preservation Committee and paid their salaries as usual. The shipping business has been decided to be handled by the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company. Wang then told the reporter in detail about his life, saying that he founded Yingji Shipping Company in Qingdao in 1927. When Shen Honglie was the mayor of Qingdao, he served as the accounting director of the port authority and the executive director of the shipping association. Later, in Shanghai, he also acted as an insurance and transportation agent for more than 30 British giant ships, and he was one of the giants in the shipping industry at the time. Unfortunately, when the War of Resistance against Japan broke out, he was arrested by the Japanese military police in Qingdao, imprisoned for seven days, and subjected to flogging and poisoning. Later, he was released on bail and fled to Shanghai. All his ships and property were lost. For more than ten years, he has been living in the current attic, suffering from poverty and illness, and sometimes even struggling to get three meals a day. After the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company returned the Xin'an, he still intended to revive his old business. He spent money to repair the ship and restore the company. However, because the ship was repeatedly used for military transportation and business was difficult, the debt reached approximately 2.4 billion yuan by the end of last year. In addition, he was weak and ill, and people were shallow and made things worse, and family stimuli only increased. For these several reasons, he had long planned to transfer this external thing to public use. This led to the donation of the ship on the 7th of this month.</p>
<p>Repeated Family Tragedies, Full of Suffering in the World</p>
<p>Regarding Wang's family situation, according to him, his great-grandfather served as the prefect of Sichuan, and his grandfather was also a fourth-rank prefect. At that time, he and Ding Ruchang and others were sworn brothers in the north, and had a very deep friendship with Li Hongzhang. Throughout his life, he did his best to engage in charitable undertakings. During the great famine in Xianhaiwei in a certain year of Guangxu, he used 3,000 taels of silver to provide disaster relief. Wang's father also had fame in the Qing Dynasty. It was only when Wang himself started working outside. He currently has two younger brothers, both of whom are currently in Qingdao, and four sisters, one in Dalian, one in Fuzhou, and one still in the communist area. His second sister is 65 years old and is the sister-in-law of Bi Shucheng. She recently fled from the communist area, alone and with all her family property gone. After Wang himself got married, he divorced due to disagreements. Later, he married another woman and adopted a child each, but before they reached adulthood, they both died one after another. His wife, due to excessive stimulation, has shaved her head and become a nun. Therefore, although Wang is only 53 years old, he has already experienced all the suffering in the world, and he has reached a state of utter despair.</p>
<p>Mayor Wu previously asked Wang to recuperate at the Municipal Hospital, but he has hired another doctor for treatment. It is said that he has diseases of the intestines, stomach, lungs, and brain. He needs treatment by experts and long-term recuperation will not be effective. He told reporters that if he can cure his illness in a few months, he is very willing to volunteer for the Ying Jizi Charity Fund Preservation Committee. Otherwise, he will find a temple to be his destination.</p>

<p>Hopes to Escape Danger and Return to Shanghai This Morning</p>
<p>Yesterday, the person in charge of the Fuel Management Committee told reporters that the Huasheng Company's "Huaqiang" vessel, loaded with 4,600 tons of coal from Keelung, set sail on the morning of the 9th. Around 2:00 AM on the 10th, when sailing near the Zhoushan Islands, it mistakenly struck a reef, causing the entire first hold to be damaged and leak water. Due to the small number of workers on the coal ship, they were unable to save it, and it nearly sank.

<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The Municipal Social Affairs Bureau sent a group of refugees from Guanyun County, Northern Jiangsu, back to their hometowns on May 26th. The refugees arrived at the Nanjing riverbank late the following night. One of them, Qi Gang, attempted to leave the group and escape, but was discovered by Inspector Xiong Xinquan of the Railway Bureau's Jiangbian Police Station, who arrested him and transferred him to the Beijing-Tianjin Police Section of the Beijing Station for interrogation. According to his confession, his name is Zhang Kun, a 26-year-old native of Suqian, and he is one of the communist bandits assigned to be in charge of activities on the Beijing-Shanghai Line. In the spring of 1944, he joined the communist bandit "Youth National Salvation Association," received training twice, and successively held important positions such as the Minister of Organization and the City Work Cadre of the North Suqian District of the Seventh District of the "Su皖 Border Region Government." This time, he was ordered to infiltrate the 23rd Division of the National Army stationed in Jingjiang, Northern Jiangsu, to secretly incite rebellion. Fearing that he would be discovered after a long time, he fled to Shanghai, mingled with the refugee team, and applied for repatriation, intending to return to the communist bandit headquarters in Northern Huai to report. Wang Zhaohuai, the director of the Railway Bureau's police department, considered Zhang to have held important positions in the bandit army and must be very familiar with the bandits lurking on the Beijing-Shanghai Line. He telegraphed Shi Yuandi, the section chief of the Beijing-Tianjin Section, to interrogate him in detail. As a result, he confessed to the plans of the treacherous bandit Qi Gang to disrupt order and endanger traffic safety, and admitted that there were accomplices lurking and operating in several cities and towns along the Beijing-Shanghai Railway. In addition to transferring Zhang to the competent authorities, the Railway Bureau also followed the clues provided by Zhang and went to the addresses to arrest the remaining accomplices.</p>

The Bao Chief, Sun Shu'an, gave Wang a check for 50 million yuan and 10 million yuan in cash, claiming it was the resettlement fee for new recruits, and entrusted Wang to hand it over to the district office. Not long after Wang left, he was arrested by plainclothes police officers from the district, who claimed that Wang was defrauding. After investigation by the Civil Affairs Bureau, it was determined that there was a previous feud between Wang and Sun, and Sun had falsely accused Wang.</p>

<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] After a week of active preparations and practice by the ferry industry, the Dragon Boat Festival finally officially appeared on the Huangpu River on a day with bright sun, high winds, and pomegranate flowers like fire. Because most shops were closed for the holiday, tens of thousands of citizens came to watch, crowding the Bund Park and the banks of the Huangpu River. Small rowing boats did brisk business, soliciting customers to go to the river to sightsee, resulting in countless boats and sails filling the river. The Water Police Bureau dispatched several patrol boats to patrol back and forth. Five "Dragon Nests" were erected from Waibaidu Bridge to Yangjiadu Wharf, each connected by multiple large ships, serving as temporary command platforms. Flags were displayed, and incense smoke swirled. Eleven dragon and phoenix boats began circling these five "Dragon Nests" at 7:00 AM, each boat's movements coordinated and orderly according to the drumbeat. There was also a person on the bow of each boat performing a costumed dance. More than a dozen merchant ships, including the Qitong, Feiyan, Haiping, and Jianghan, which were docked in the Huangpu River, set off firecrackers when the dragon boats passed by to express their welcome. Many gorgeously dressed women in the audience competed to tie large banknotes to eggshells and throw them into the river. The crew members of each boat, upon seeing this, bravely jumped into the water, freely maneuvering back and forth in the turbulent waves to compete for the money. Their swimming skills earned them much applause. After 12:00 noon, the boats lined up and sailed back to the Dawang Temple on Suzhou Creek to rest. At 3:00 PM, they paddled back onto the river to perform again. The dragons and phoenixes raised their heads and tails, and cheers were heard wherever the boats passed. Because the municipal ferry workers went on strike yesterday and thousands of ferry workers along the coast were also off for the holiday, the water carnival did not end until after 7:00 PM.</p>

<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The Fuan Amusement Park at the intersection of Zhonghua Road and Dongmen Road was originally scheduled to open yesterday. The night before last, when the park's General Manager Chen Daqi ordered more than 200 employees to burn red candles on the stage on the second floor to worship the gods, a conflict arose between Chen and the manager, Li Renyuan (also a shareholder), over the matter of recommending employees. Chen instructed his son, Ziqin, to go out and gather dozens of hooligans to come and cause trouble, ordering them to stay on the sixth floor. Li firmly defended the second floor. At 2:00 AM yesterday, the two sides gathered hundreds of people, each holding sharp blades and iron hooks, and engaged in a major brawl. After the Yimiao Police Sub-bureau was notified, it ordered police officers to rush to suppress the brawl. At the same time, the Municipal Police Bureau was also notified and dispatched flying fortresses to rush to the scene, breaking open the front and back doors. Most of the perpetrators had already escaped over the wall. Four suspects, Chen Xinlin, Li Guilin, Li Qingzheng, Liang Xinshi, and others, were arrested on the spot and taken to the station for interrogation. The injured, Zhuang A'gen (31 years old), Shen A'fa (18 years old), and manager Li Renyuan (28 years old), were all taken to Renji Hospital for treatment by car. The principal culprit, Chen Daqi, is at large and being pursued. The Fuan Amusement Park, which was scheduled to reopen yesterday, was therefore unable to do so.</p>

<h3 id="e99">The Gold Control Bureau has Established Strict Management Methods to Prevent Banks and Businesses from Issuing Promissory Notes Indiscriminately Yesterday, It Also Summoned the Bankers, Money Changers, and Trust Companies Associations to Study How to Reduce the Circulation of Promissory Notes <a href="#e99" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c99" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">99</a></h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Since the implementation of the ban on using promissory notes as collateral, the number of promissory notes issued by banks and businesses on the market has suddenly increased. In order to prevent banks and businesses from issuing empty promissory notes indiscriminately, increasing the risk to credit, and affecting price fluctuations, the Shanghai Gold Control Bureau has sent out ten groups of auditors since last Saturday to inspect the issuance of promissory notes by various banks and businesses. At the same time, it has established strict management methods and issued a notice to the Bankers, Money Changers, and Trust Companies Associations to comply. It is understood that these methods are:</p>
<p>(1) The issuance of a promissory note, if requested by a customer, must be based on the customer having a balance in their account or exchanging it for cash, and should be issued at the time of the transaction. Promissory notes must not be given to customers in advance.</p>
<p>(2) After a promissory note is received, it should be immediately transferred and canceled, and not be held in the treasury or used as collateral to pay other customers.</p>
<p>(3) All promissory notes issued by banks and businesses, in addition to paying their own taxes, should be limited to customer requests. Regardless of the purpose of the promissory note, the balance of the promissory note account that day must have sufficient funds deposited in the treasury, the central bank's clearinghouse, or other banks.</p>
<p>(4) If a bank or business violates the above regulations regarding the issuance of promissory notes and is found to be true by the Gold Control Bureau, it will be severely punished.</p>
<p>[Another Dispatch] In order to reduce the circulation of promissory notes and prevent credit expansion, the Shanghai Gold Control Bureau invited the responsible persons of the city's Bankers, Money Changers, and Trust Companies Associations to a meeting at 11:00 AM yesterday for discussions. It is reported that the content of the discussions focused on how to reduce the circulation of promissory notes as much as possible under the principle of prohibiting their use as collateral. Two principles were decided: (1) Promote certified checks to replace promissory notes, and (2) According to regulations, legitimate factories can carefully negotiate collateral contracts with banks and businesses. The three associations will convene a meeting immediately to formulate implementation measures based on these two principles.</p>

<h3 id="e110">New Foreign Exchange Settlement Methods Announced; Industry and Commerce Guidance Office Issues Opinions (Continued) Regarding the Implementation of Technology, Detailed Research is Needed to Achieve the Goal of Promoting Production and Expanding Exports <a href="#e110" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c110" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">110</a></h3>
<p>(10) Private trading of foreign exchange certificates will inevitably lead to market chaos, affecting the projected costs of export goods. It is best to have a public market with daily price listings to ensure uniformity.</p>
<p>(11) The transfer of foreign exchange certificates should not be restricted by region. For example, if Region A has a surplus and Region B has a deficit, the foreign exchange certificates from Region A should be allowed to be transferred in Region B. However, the transfer period of seven days is too short and should be extended. However, if the extension is too long, there may be speculation and manipulation. It seems that two weeks would be more appropriate.</p>
<p>(12) The transfer of foreign exchange certificates should be limited to one time only. That is, after the exporter or overseas remittance recipient sells the foreign exchange certificate they received to the importer, the importer should not resell this certificate to a third party, in order to prevent importers with strong financial resources from buying and reselling in large quantities, manipulating the market, and seeking exorbitant profits.</p>
<p>(13) It is best to issue import licenses in three installments per quarter, that is, the quarterly quota is divided into three months to issue licenses. Importers can settle foreign exchange for one-third of the quota each month. The reasons are as follows: Currently, the implementation of the new foreign exchange settlement method has indeed increased exports, but the increase is gradual. The foreign exchange certificates obtained by exporters will not increase excessively in each month. When the quota is announced, importers will find it more beneficial to settle foreign exchange early, which will inevitably lead to a rush to buy certificates. Because of the large quantity, the supply will inevitably fall short of demand. Only importers with strong financial resources and strong activity can meet their needs. Factories with slightly weaker financial resources will inevitably be left out. Although the Central Bank can issue special certificates to regulate the market, the foreign exchange certificates required by each importer for the quarterly quota are satisfied in the first month, then the demand will be greatly reduced or unnecessary in the second and third months. If so, the price of foreign exchange certificates in the second and third months will plummet, and exporters will suffer great losses. Therefore, for the sake of market stability, it is advisable to issue import licenses and settle foreign exchange on a monthly basis for each quarterly quota.</p>
<p>(14) When the supply of foreign exchange certificates exceeds demand, the Central Bank should buy them at the highest price. When demand exceeds supply, it should increase the supply to prevent speculation and price gouging, otherwise both importers and exporters will inevitably suffer losses, causing import and export trade to fall into chaos.</p>
<p>(15) Exporters can increase their own funds because exporting is profitable, so the government loans they need can be reduced. However, it takes a long time to purchase goods from the place of origin and transport them to the export port, so there is still a need for capital turnover. Therefore, packing loans must still be handled in the future and cannot be stopped.</p>
<p>(16) Promoting exports can improve the national economy, especially for the vast rural areas. In the past, due to layer-by-layer exploitation by intermediaries, direct producers were still in difficulty, and only a few intermediaries obtained huge profits, which ran counter to the purpose of improving the national economy. In the future, relevant authorities should jointly study solutions to ensure that export benefits can benefit direct producers as much as possible, and not be exclusively enjoyed by a few people.</p>
<p>(17) Regarding the foreign exchange settlement methods for overseas remittances: 1. Efforts should be made to simplify the procedures; 2. Efforts should be made to ensure that the difference between the proceeds from the sale of overseas remittance certificates and the market price is close to the market price. The problems in this are complex and the competent authorities should conduct detailed research on the methods to facilitate implementation, so as to achieve the practical effect of attracting overseas remittances.

<h3 id="e134">"Preface to Fu Tang Ci" - A Tentative Interpretation <a href="#e134" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c134" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">134</a></h3>
<p>— Cheng Huichang</p>
<p>Tan Xian is an excellent writer among the Ci poets of the Qing Dynasty. This is known to all. His "Fu Tang Ci" has a very short preface. The full text is:</p>
<p>Zhou Meicheng said: "Flowing water hinders chariot warfare." He also said: "Damp clothes waste furnace smoke." Xin You'an said: "I don't know how much my strength has declined, but I only feel lazy to go upstairs lately." Those who fill in Ci, try to find out the gist of it from this. I have been fond of learning for thirty years, and have slightly mastered writing. I am deeply ashamed, both great and small, even of composing Ci. My fellow villager, Xiang Sheng (whose name is Hongzu, courtesy name Liansheng, and has "Yi Yun Ci"), believes: "If you don't do things that are of no benefit, how can you spend a limited life?" His words are critical, but he only knows two and five, but does not know ten. Tan Xian wrote.</p>
<p>This preface has no date. However, according to Tan's own preface to "Fu Tang Ci Lu"—an anthology from the Tang to the Ming Dynasties—he said:</p>
<p>I started learning poetry at the age of fifteen. At twenty-two... I began to write Ci. ... After thirty, I examined its various schools. ... After forty, I became more aware that ancient music seemed to be in the Yuefu, and the remainder of Yuefu was in Ci. ... At the age of fifty, my view was finally settled.</p>
<p>Comparing the "thirty years of joyful learning" in the Ci preface with "my view was finally settled at the age of fifty" in the Ci Lu preface, the opinion in the short article above is undoubtedly his "final conclusion in his later years" on Ci.</p>
<p>However, the meaning of the Ci preface is quite vague. First, he extracted four lines from three Ci poems by Zhou and Xin, believing that people should use these examples to understand the message of composing Ci. What exactly do these four lines of Ci represent? Second, he believes that Xiang Liansheng's two sentences only state one side of the matter, while his words occupy the other side. If they cannot be connected, it means "knowing two and five but not knowing ten." So, where is the difference between this "two and five" and "ten"?</p>
<p>The purpose of this article is to attempt to provide a speculative answer to these two points. For convenience, I will first transcribe the full text of the three Ci poems below:</p>
<p>Zhou Meicheng "Spring Rain"</p>
<p>Facing the overnight smoke, the spring birds are quiet, and the flying rain sometimes soaks the tall house. The green jade banners on the wall, all washed of their leaden frost, the tender shoots touch each other. Moisture presses against the zither strings, cold invades the pillow screen, and spider webs stick to the bamboo curtains. In the deserted post pavilion, listening to the endless sound of the eaves, I fall into a light sleep. But sorrow startles me greatly, dreams are hard to remember, and I pity my solitude. The travelers' desire to return is urgent, and the first thought is that the flowing water hinders the chariot wheels. How can I bear to see Lan Cheng haggard and Wei Jie thin, and easily hurt my eyes at leisure? No wonder the Pingyang guest, tears fall, in the mournful melody of the flute. Moreover, in this desolate land of green weeds. Red grains cover the ground, and thorny peach trees outside the door are like beans. Who will hold a candle for night tours?</p>
<p>Zhou Meicheng "Man Ting Fang" (Composed at Wu Xiang Mountain in Lishui on a Summer Day)</p>
<p>The wind ages the oriole chicks, the rain fattens the plums, and the midday shade of the beautiful trees is clear and round. The land is low and close to the mountain, and damp clothes waste furnace smoke. People are quiet, and crows and kites enjoy themselves, outside the small bridge, the new green splashes. Leaning on the railing for a long time, the yellow reeds and bitter bamboo make me suspect that I am floating on a boat on the Nine Rivers. Every year, like a swallow returning to its nest, I drift on the vast sea and come to roost in a tall elm tree. Let's not think about things outside ourselves, but stay close to the wine bottle. I am a haggard guest weary of Jiangnan, unable to bear listening to hurried pipes and complicated strings. Beside the singing banquet, first settle the pillow, and let me sleep when I am drunk.</p>
<p>Xin You'an "Zhe Gu Tian" (Composed After Recovering from Illness on Returning to Goose Lake)</p>
<p>I put down my pen, the stream hall is cold and wants to close, the broken clouds rely on the water and are collected in the evening. The red lotuses lean on each other as if drunk, and the white gulls are silent and must be worried. The book says "duo duo," but let it rest. A hill and a gully are also romantic. I don't know how much my strength has declined, but I only feel lazy to go upstairs lately.</p>
<p>Tan's opinions on Ci are scattered in his essays and diaries, but his comments on Zhou Zheng'an's Ci debate are more important. In his comments on the Ci debate, his opinion on the line "travelers" in Zhou Ci's "Da Pu" is:</p>
<p>Also the tears of Xinting.</p>
<p>His opinion on the line "The land is low" in "Man Ting Fang" is:</p>
<p>I feel that "Li Sao" is twenty-five, and the person who left is not far away.</p>
<p>He did not comment on Xin Ci's work. Judging from the two comments on Zhou Ci, it is still impossible to directly use them to explain the Ci preface, because the words are too simple, making it impossible for people to immediately associate the story of Xinting and the ancient book "Chu Ci" with how to "find out the gist of it." Therefore, to solve this mystery, we must return to the Ci itself and start by analyzing their modes of expression.</p>
<p>Speaking of Ci as Ci, the lines Tan mentioned clearly depict the scenes in these three poems. "Spring Rain," as the title suggests, describes the spring rain. The first part describes what the author heard, saw, and felt after being awakened by the sound of rain in the guest house—both physiological and psychological. The second part describes the difficulty of returning home due to the loneliness in the middle of the journey. "The travelers' desire to return is urgent" is a statement of fact about the past and present; "Flowing water hinders chariot warfare" is about the future, based on imagination. Because of the eagerness to return home, as soon as he hears the rain, he immediately has thoughts of mud on the road, blocked wheels, and the inability to travel. "Man Ting Fang" is a feeling of a "tired guest from Jiangnan" throughout the poem. Generally, the first part describes the scenery, and the second part describes the emotions. The description of the scenery is both real and imaginary, and should be distinguished. For example, "yellow reeds and bitter bamboo" are real, while "floating on a boat on the Nine Rivers" is imaginary, merely using the allusion of Bai Letian's "Pipa Xing." "The land is low and close to the mountain" is also real, while "damp clothes waste furnace smoke" may not have actually happened at the time. The function of this sentence is nothing more than to supplement the description of the low-lying area in the previous sentence. Because the following talks about "leaning on the railing," "before the wine bottle," and "beside the singing banquet," which are consistent with the events at the time. The author would never, and should not, suddenly be busy taking time to dry his clothes while drinking and listening to music. As for "Zhe Gu Tian," it is a poignant mood displayed by a late hero in a plain life. The depression of this old fighter who exchanged "ten thousand words to pacify the Rong" for "planting trees in the east family" is very clear. In this Ci poem, it is certainly not because he occasionally feels strenuous going upstairs that he suddenly realizes that his strength has declined. He may not have even had the idea of going upstairs when composing the Ci. It is only from "strength declining" that he thought of being "lazy to go upstairs."</p>
<p>If what I have said above is not too far from the author's original intention, then we can summarize a common point from the modes of expression of the lines mentioned by Tan. That is, they all adopt a layered way of thinking. Has the "flowing water" already "hindered" the "chariot warfare"? No, it hasn't. It's just because there is rain that he thought of "flowing water hindering chariot warfare." Have the "damp clothes" already "wasted" the "furnace smoke"? No, it hasn't. It's just because the land is low and wet that he thought of "damp clothes wasting furnace smoke." Has he ever "gone" "upstairs"? No, he hasn't. It's just because his "strength" has "declined" that he thought of being "lazy" to "go upstairs."</p>
<p>Then, further, we want to ask: Why does Tan value this kind of method so much? That involves his view of Ci. Since Zhang Fuwen's "Ci Selection" respected the Ci style and regarded Ci as being of equal value to the "Book of Songs" and "Chu Ci," the so-called gentleness, sincerity, loyalty, and affection became the highest standards for writing and discussing Ci. Zhou Zhi'an's "Entrustment" theory and Chen Yifeng's "Melancholy" theory are all aftereffects of Zhang's theory. There are slight differences between them, but they are generally consistent. At that time, this theory can be said to have been popular for a generation. Tan was born after Zhang and Zhou, and at the same time as Yifeng, and was a figure in that environment. His preface to "Fu Tang Ci Lu" discusses the purpose of Ci, saying:</p>
<p>The highest is expressing aspirations and eternal words, the second is pure aspirations and fragrant deeds, and then it converges on elegance and refinement.</p>
<p>This is completely the same viewpoint as the Changzhou school. Taking gentleness, sincerity, loyalty, and affection as the standard for literature originates from the rationalistic thought of Confucianism, that is, the so-called way of loyalty and forgiveness. Loyalty is doing one's best, and forgiveness is extending oneself to others, which is the expansion of empathy. In psychological development and textual expression, pushing from this to that, and thinking from another's perspective, is a further step in thinking and a concrete display of empathy. This method can replace others in thinking, or it can be just thinking about oneself. One can think of others from oneself, think of the past or future from the present, think of that place from this place, or completely reverse the process. The following examples all belong to this type:</p>
<p>Du Zimei "Moonlit Night"</p>
<p>Tonight, the moon in Fuzhou, I am the only one watching in Zhongzhou.</p>
<p>Fang Xugu "Double Ninth Festival"</p>
<p>The mountain rain has just cleared and I look out, I expect I don't have the strength to climb.</p>
<p>Liu Shuqing "Eight-Tone Ganzhou"</p>
<p>I imagine the beautiful woman gazing from her boudoir, mistaking the returning boat on the horizon many times.</p>
<p>Xin You'an "Touching the Fish"</p>
<p>I always fear the flowers will bloom early in spring.</p>
<p>Therefore, in the eyes of people who generally respect the Ci style, this method is not only a technique in itself, a technique to increase the depth and breadth of emotion, but also a direct proof of gentleness, sincerity, loyalty, and affection. Because it can enable the work to achieve the lofty effect expected by the author. The three examples Tan mentioned happen to all be of this type of layered thinking, no wonder he wrote it solemnly as a "final conclusion in his later years" and taught "those who fill in Ci to try to find out the gist of it from this." Regarding this speculation, Tan's own Ci poems also provide references. For example:</p>
<p>Su Mu Zhe</p>
<p>Peach blossoms on the road, withering first inside the door.</p>
<p>Jiao Zhao (Lotus Flower)</p>
<p>Wanting to be as long-lived as the clouds in the mountains, paddling to pick water chestnuts, with many thorns hurting my hand.</p>
<p>Yi Jiu You (The title is too long, omitted.)</p>
<p>Autumn coolness reduces beautiful thoughts, I imagine it is like a Buddhist monk's room by the water, dampening my clothes.</p>
<p>Linjiang Xian (Remembering Parting)</p>
<p>Tear stains want to write a blush on my face, I endure it silently, fearing to stain the roadside flowers.</p>
<p>These all share the same idea as the preface and the ones I mentioned earlier. It can be seen that Tan not only knew this meaning, but also combined knowledge and action. As for the words "tears of Xinting" and "Li Sao is twenty-five, and the person who left is not far away" in the Ci debate, they are using metaphor and allegory to discuss Ci, believing that what Zhou Ci said about human affairs is also about national affairs. That is, what Tan said in the preface to "Fu Tang Ci Lu":</p>
<p>The author's intention may not necessarily be so, but why must the reader's intention not be so.</p>
<p>It seems to be two different things from what is mentioned in the Ci preface. When it comes to metaphor and gentleness and sincerity, the relationship is naturally very close. However, this article cannot involve that.</p>
<p>Now, let's talk about another point, the difference between Tan and Xiang's opinions. As mentioned earlier, Tan's Ci theory is based on the Changzhou school, and they view the status of Ci as very lofty. Xiang, on the other hand, considers it a "useless thing" to "spend a limited life," in other words, only acknowledging it as a form of leisure entertainment. This is naturally something Tan cannot agree with. Moreover, there is still a complex process in the techniques of how to achieve gentleness, sincerity, loyalty, and affection, which cannot be obliterated with just a few words of "useless thing." Therefore, although Tan knows that Xiang's words are "critical words" from a heartbroken person with other feelings, he cannot help but think that he only knows "two and five" but does not know "ten."</p>

<h3 id="e135">Postscript to the Tang Manuscript of Sun Mian's Tang Yun (Remaining Pages) <a href="#e135" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c135" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">135</a></h3>
<p>— Zhou Zumuo</p>
<p>These remaining pages of the Tang manuscript of the rhyme book are stored in the National Library of France in Paris, obtained by Paul Pelliot from Dunhuang. Pelliot's number is 2018. The original was a scroll, but only the fourteen lines of the East, Winter, and Zhong rhymes remain. Judging from the script, it was written by someone after the mid-Tang Dynasty. Although there is no book title or author's surname, the characters used for the fanqie (pronunciation guide) mostly disagree with the books of Lu Fayan and Wang Renxu. For example, the Winter rhyme has "Bin Cang Zong fan," but the Changsun Jian Annotation of Lu Yun (that is, the second kind of Wang's manuscript Qieyun) and the two Wang Yun versions with Xiang's postscript and Song's postscript stored in the Palace Museum both use "Zai Zong fan"; also "Zhi Rong fan," Changsun's book and Wang Yun use "You Zhi Long fan"; "Xiang Li Dong fan," Changsun's book and Wang Yun use "Li Zong fan"; "Zong Zuo Dong fan," Changsun's book uses "Zuo Zong fan," and Wang Yun uses "Zuo Cong fan"; "Rong Yi Gong fan," Changsun's book and Wang Yun use "Yu Feng fan"; all these disagree. According to its system, it is actually consistent with the Tang Yun formerly collected by Jiang Fu, so it can be determined as Sun Mian's book. Why do I say that? Now I will list five things as evidence:</p>
<p>(1) The annotations of the first character of each rhyme head in this fragment are all explanations listed first, and the fanqie is listed later, which is consistent with Tang Yun.</p>
<p>(2) This book collects quite a few characters in each rhyme head. For all newly added characters, the rhyme head is called "Ji Jia Ji," and each newly added character is individually noted, the system is very detailed and thorough, which is exactly the same as Tang Yun. For example, under "Long" it says: "Li Zhong fan, seven plus three," and the words "Jing Ji Long" below are all individually marked with the word "Jia." Tang Yun also has many such examples in the Wei rhyme under "Yu": "Xu Ji fan, six plus two," and the words "Kai Qi" below are also like that. There is no need to list all of them, this is enough to prove that the two books have the same system.</p>
<p>(3) Sun Mian's Tang preface has the words "As for foreign anecdotes, strange legends, origins of surnames, local products, mountains, rivers, grasses, trees, birds, beasts, insects, and fish, all are recorded in detail with evidence and compiled according to rhyme." Now the annotations in this book are quite complex, broadly citing various books as evidence, and are particularly detailed on surnames and geography, which is even more consistent with Sun's preface. Moreover, the books cited are also the same as in Jiang Fu's Tang Yun. For example, in the fragment, "Xi" is cited from Huainanzi, "Fu" below says "From Exotic Objects," "Dong" below says "Also a surname, Dong Shou, Left Sima of Murong Huang of the Former Yan," this comes from the Former Yan Record. Also, "Hu" below cites Character Styles, "Chun" below cites Shiben, "Song" below cites Mysterious Records, the words "Bin Ling" below cite Guangya, and the words "Peng Feng Song Nan" below cite Shuowen, the breadth of its collection can be generally seen. And in Jiang's Tang Yun, "Mu" under the Twilight rhyme cites the Former Yan Record, "Yan" under the Xian rhyme cites Character Styles, "Can" under the Zhun rhyme cites Huainanzi, and "Na" under the He rhyme cites Exotic Objects, etc., the books cited are also the same. It is very clear that the two must come from the hand of the same person.</p>
<p>(4) Guangyun notes under the word "Gong" in the third Zhong rhyme: "Lu used Gong Zong Cong etc. to enter the Winter rhyme, which is wrong," Mr. Wang Jing'an has determined that this is the old text of Tang Yun (see Guantang Jilin Volume 8, Postscript to the Tang Manuscript Tang Yun collected by Jiang in Wu County), then the transfer of these three rhymes to the Zhong rhyme began with Sun Mian. Now, although the "Nong" rhyme under the Winter rhyme of this fragment is incomplete, compared with Changsun's book, the words under this should be the "Nong" rhyme and the "Gong" rhyme, and there are no longer the three rhymes of Gong Zong Cong. And the "Rong" character of these three Zhong rhymes, the sound is "Yi Gong fan," using the "Gong" character as the pronunciation guide, can especially prove that the three rhymes of Gong Zong Cong have been included in the Zhong rhyme; which is consistent with Mr. Jing'an's words.</p>
<p>(5) This fragment "Zhi Xi Zang Zong," the sound of "Zong" is "Zuo Dong," which does not agree with Changsun's book and Wang Yun, but agrees with both Da Xu's Shuowen and Xiao Xu's Shuowen Zhuan Yun Pu ten-volume version. Da Xu has clearly stated that the sound he determined is based on Sun Mian, so this fragment must be the same book as the Tang Yun on which Da Xu was based. Only the sound of this "Rong" character is "Yi Gong fan," while Da Xu's Shuowen makes it "Yu Feng fan," which is slightly different.</p>
<p>With these five pieces of evidence, this manuscript is undoubtedly Sun Mian's Tang Yun. Previously, Mr. Jing'an said that the note under "Gong" in Guangyun was the old text of Tang Yun, which was originally a speculative statement, but now, unexpectedly, in this fragment, its corroborating evidence was obtained, this is what is called the difficulty of expecting things and the fact that they often happen morning and evening. Then, although these are only a few dozen lines, they are also precious.</p>
<h3 id="e136">Correction of Errors in the "Chronological Biography of Zhang Shizhai" <a href="#e136" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c136" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">136</a></h3>
<p>— Yao Jingcun &amp; Hu Shi</p>
<p>Dear Mr. Shizhi:</p>
<p>Your old work from more than a decade ago, "Chronological Biography of Mr. Shizhai," is clear, concise, and truly a good book. Half a year ago, I browsed it once, and today I read it carefully from the beginning. On pages three to four of the main text of the chronological biography, within less than three hundred words, I found two places that can be discussed, and I would like to explain them to you. With your understanding, you should be able to understand my rudeness.</p>
<p>First, I will copy your original text:</p>
<p>Qianlong three years, Wu Wu (Western calendar 1738) Mr. born. (Ren Youzhi's Other Biography)</p>
<p>The previous year, Ding Si, Mr.'s father, Mr. Xiangqu, failed the provincial examination and resided in the home of his cousin Yuanye (Yun Gong). (The Deeds of Cousin Xun Ruren) Presumably he immediately returned to Shaoxing.</p>
<p>In this year, Mr.'s friend Ren Dachun (another name is Zhi) was born in Xinghua. (Ren's Other Biography) In this year, Mr.'s teacher Zhu Yun (Zhujun, Tonghe) was already ten years old. Famous people at the same time, Yuan Mei (Zicai) was already twenty-three years old. Qian Daxin (Xiaozheng, Xinmei) was eleven years old, and Dai Zhen (Dongyuan) was sixteen years old. Wan Jing (Zhenyi), a senior in eastern Zhejiang, was already eighty years old, and Quan Zuwang (Shaoyi, Xieshan) was thirty-four years old.</p>
<p>Qianlong four years, Ji Wei (1739)</p>
<p>Mr. two years old.</p>
<p>When he was two or three years old, his uncle Hengyi often carried him to the neighbor Zhu Old Man to ask for wine, which became a daily routine. (Preface to the Eightieth Birthday of the Tenth Uncle), so Mr. grew up to be good at drinking.</p>
<p>In this year, July, the Qing court completed the Ming History. The style of learning changed and became focused on the Four Books and literature. (Preface to the Anthology of Ye Hetu in the Donghua Record)</p>
<p>Qianlong five years, Geng Shen (1740)</p>
<p>Mr. three years old.</p>
<p>In this year, Cui Shu was born in Daming, and Zhao Yi was born in Yanghu.</p>
<p>The Qing court completed the Great Qing Unified Geography. (Preface to the Geography) Qianlong six years, Xin You (1741)</p>
<p>Mr. four years old.</p>
<p>In this year, Wan Jing died, at the age of eighty (there is no punctuation mark in the original book).</p>
<p>Within these four entries above, there are two points that can be discussed:</p>
<p>First: Regarding Wan Jing's age at death. In Qianlong three years, he was already eighty years old, so when he died in Qianlong six years, he should not still be eighty. This point may be a mistake by the printer. Your original manuscript should not be like this.</p>
<p>Second: Regarding Zhao Yi's year of birth. According to the above entries, Zhao Yi was born in Qianlong five years, two years younger than Shizhai and thirteen years younger than Qian Daxin. But Qian Daxin clearly said in the preface to the "Notes on the Twenty-Two Histories":</p>
<p>"I (Daxin) have the same hobbies as Mr. (Zhao Yi), and I am two years younger than Mr."</p>
<p>It can be seen that Zhao Yi was two years older than Qian Daxin, so he would be thirteen years older than Shizhai. His year of birth should be Yongzheng four years, Bing Wu (Western calendar 1726), and should not be Qianlong five years when Shizhai was three years old. This inference differs from your statement by fifteen years, and you did not specify the source in the entry "Zhao Yi was born in Yanghu in Qianlong five years." I don't know which is correct?</p>
<p>If you could give me some guidance on the above two points, I would be extremely grateful. Also, the "Chronological Biography of Mr. Zhang Shizhai" that I read was published by the Commercial Press, the first edition after the national crisis in May of the 22nd year of the Republic of China. The "Notes on the Twenty-Two Histories" that I read was printed by the World Book Company, the first edition in December of the 25th year of the Republic of China. I am including these details for your reference and comparison.</p>
<p>Respectfully wishing you well. Yao Jingcun (37, 5, 24)</p>
<p>Dear Mr. Jingcun:</p>
<p>Thank you for your instructions.</p>
<p>The Chronological Biography of Tong Shizhai was a tentative work I did more than twenty years ago. After it was published, I saw Mr. Liu Hanyi's engraved "Posthumous Writings of Zhang," which included "Biography of My Late Friend During Geng Xin." At that time, I wanted to revise this chronological biography. Later, a young scholar named Yao Mingda added newly discovered materials to my original book, which became the "Chronological Biography of Zhang Shizhai" that you saw. It was published under the names of both Hu Shi and Yao Mingda. (The original version in the 11th year of the Republic of China only used my name.)</p>
<p>After reading your letter, I opened my original book and realized that the errors you pointed out were all unintentional mistakes made by Mr. Yao Mingda when he revised the book. My original chronological biography only had Qianlong three years and Qianlong seven years. The records from Qianlong four years to six years in the middle were all added by Mr. Yao.</p>
<p>Below Qianlong three years, the sentence "Presumably he immediately returned to Shaoxing" was added by Mr. Yao. Also, the ages of Wan Jing and Quan Zuwang were also added by Mr. Yao. Wan Jing was born in the 16th year of Shunzhi, Ji Hai (1659), so in Qianlong three years (1738), he was eighty years old, and when he died in Qianlong six years (1741), he should have been eighty-three years old.</p>
<p>Qian Daxin was born on the seventh day of the first lunar month in the sixth year of Yongzheng (February 16, 1728), according to the epitaph written by Wang Chang. In Qianlong three years, Qian was eleven years old, which is correct.</p>
<p>Zhao Yi was born on the twenty-second day of the tenth lunar month in the fifth year of Yongzheng (December 4, 1727), so he was only two and a half months older than Qian Daxin. Qian's preface to the "Notes on the Twenty-Two Histories," saying that he was two years younger than Zhao, seems to be a mistake. Perhaps "two years" is a mistaken transcription of "one or two months." Your calculation that Zhao Yi was born in Yongzheng four years is one year off. Mr. Yao Mingda probably mistook Yongzheng five years as Qianlong five years, hence the thirteen-year error.</p>
<p>Regarding Zhao's birth date, Sun Xingyan's epitaph does not record it. The complete collection is accompanied by a chronological biography of Qian You'ou Bei, which says that he was born on the twenty-second day of the tenth lunar month in the fifth year of Yongzheng, which matches the birthdates recorded in volumes 44 and 48 of the Ou Bei Poetry Collection. Therefore, Qian Daxin's preface saying that he was two years younger must be a mistake. This preface is not included in the Qian Yan Tang Anthology, so we don't have another edition to correct this "year" character.</p>
<p>Your reading is so meticulous, you can surely find more errors from Mr. Yao Mingda and me. Mr. Yao has now become an ancient person, I want to especially thank you.</p>

<p>Dear Sir, We have read reader Shi Yuanren's opinion in the "Social Service" column of your newspaper on the 9th of this month: "Believing that the fare of the Qingpu-Shanghai long-distance bus is too high, hoping that the company will realize its error." Since our company's restoration two years ago, all expenses have been minimized in order to use the remaining funds to repair the damaged roads from the past eight years, totaling nineteen bridges and twenty-three kilometers of gravel roads. We have also actively improved vehicle equipment. As for the fare, it is handled in accordance with the regulations of the Provincial Highway Bureau (starting from May 11, the original fare is increased by 80%). Our company has moderately added 60% to maintain the cost of driving. As for raw materials, since the government does not supply foreign exchange at official prices, we have to seek them on the black market. Compared with state-owned enterprises, our difficulties are not the same. We are very willing to accept Mr. Shi's suggestions and hope that people from all walks of life will contribute more suggestions for our reference. Sincerely, Shanghai-Qingpu Long-Distance Bus Co., Ltd.</p>

<p>— Le Ying</p>
<p>"A spring not ideal for studying" has passed, and now is the time for "summer slumber is just right." Especially for the first class in the afternoon, the temptation of "just right for slumber" is particularly strong. If the teacher happens to be lecturing on Song-Ming Neo-Confucianism or 13th-century theology, then there probably won't be anyone who doesn't emulate Zai Yu's daytime nap. Writing this reminds me of an old story. It is said that a certain Mr. Wu, a mathematics teacher at a private middle school in Suzhou, was quite plump. One summer while teaching, he pointed to a math problem on the blackboard and asked a student to solve it. Before the student finished the calculation, the teacher was already leaning against the blackboard, sound asleep and snoring loudly.</p>
<p>The diplomats attending various United Nations conferences probably feel the same way as students having class in the sweltering summer heat. Meetings are held every day, and all they do is repeat the same old arguments. Not to mention the emptiness of the speeches, they are also endlessly long and require translation. After finally listening to a long tirade, the opposing side comes up with another long tirade. "Fatigue bombing" continues relentlessly, which is truly unbearable. Yet, under the watchful eyes of the crowd, they can neither slip out for a walk nor steal a nap.</p>
<p>And so, these solemn and dignified representatives pick up the pencils on the table and write, and write...</p>
<p>What exactly do they write?</p>
<p>A journalist wanted to answer this question. He exhausted all methods, contacting the representatives' staff, bribing the cleaning ladies, and went to great lengths to find a few of these drawings.</p>
<p>However, what is the meaning of these "doodles"? The journalist consulted a specialist in psychoanalysis - Dr. Werner Wolff, a renowned professor at Bard College. Below is Dr. Wolff's analysis.</p>
<p>Gromyko's incessant repetition of the same lines shows his extreme nervous tension, just like many people who constantly feel oppressed. He seems compelled to do something and feels he must do it again and again. As for the pair of thickly drawn eyes in the upper left corner, they indicate that Gromyko feels he cannot control many events himself. His responsibility is "observation," and observation requires eyes, so he draws these eyes with particular emphasis.</p>
<p>The Belarusian representative, Kiselev, in fact, always follows Gromyko's lead. However, the densely interwoven squares in this drawing indicate his fear. He fears that many units will break away, so he uses all means to connect them together. The many fine lines within the squares indicate his tension, anxiety, and fear. As for the "Yes" on the right side of the drawing, it depends on what was being discussed that day.</p>
<p>Vandenberg's "portrait" indicates that the author often drifts between daydreams and reality. The "person" in his drawing is very frightening, especially the glasses and the pair of eyes, which are quite magical. However, the handkerchief in the pocket and the gemstone on the tie indicate that he is quite powerful and likes to dress well. Vandenberg is indeed very wary of this kind of person. (According to the journalist who collected these "doodles," Vandenberg is the most enthusiastic doodler at various gatherings.)</p>
<p>Dulles drew snakes. Dr. Wolff said that although most people think of snakes as symbols of danger and aggression, the heads of these snakes are quite like gentle and elegant swans. It seems that the author is striving for peaceful coexistence, so he portrays the ferocious things in such a "benevolent manner."</p>
<p>Pichon's delicate and soft brushstrokes indicate that he is very sensitive, somewhat neurotic, prone to depression, and often anxious.</p>
<p>According to Dr. Wolff, Gu Shaochuan's calligraphy is "abstract and full of aesthetic concepts." He said that the person who wrote these characters must also focus on the abstract or the principles when handling affairs. But when we Chinese people look at it, we feel that the meaning of these characters is quite obvious. "Trouble," "Hypocrisy" - aren't these the most accurate comments on those diplomatic speeches? And Dr. Gu's meticulousness is revealed in these neat "hollowed-out characters"!</p>
<p>Finally, there is the United Nations Secretary-General, Trygve Lie. Dr. Wolff said that this paper has more words than drawings, indicating that this person likes to reason and does little. Dr. Wolff not only spoke about Lie's character but also about the characteristics of the United Nations organization he leads. In fact, if the United Nations were not such an organization that specializes in endless reasoning, then these many diplomats might not have had those leisurely pursuits to leave behind these "calligraphic treasures."</p>
<p>[In addition to verbal sparring, the representatives of the United Nations agencies occasionally scribble at will, which is quite interesting. The creators of these seven "masterpieces" are: (from right) (1) Former Soviet representative to the United Nations Security Council, Andrei Gromyko; (2) Belarusian representative to the United Nations General Assembly, Kiselev; (3) United States representative to the United Nations General Assembly, Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Vandenberg; (4) United States representative to the United Nations, John Foster Dulles, who was scolded by Vyshinsky as a "warmonger"; (5) French Foreign Minister, Pichon; (6) Our country's ambassador to the United States, Gu Weijun; (7) United Nations Secretary-General, Trygve Lie.

<h3 id="e143">Concerning Opium <a href="#e143" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c143" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">143</a></h3>
<p>— Bai Yong</p>
<p>Li Xiaochi of Jiangning's "A Brief Account of Opium Affairs" and another "Remembering the Pain" recording stories of the Taiping Rebellion are two immortal masterpieces. Although Jiangning was not the port of entry for opium, this first unequal treaty was signed here, shattering the two-thousand-year-old confidence of considering itself a celestial dynasty. It is fitting that Mr. Li wrote this account in anger.</p>
<p>Recently, I read Zhang Ruogu's compiled "Chronicle of Ma Xiangbo's Life," which quotes Chen Lesu's talk about his experiences at eighty years old: "I was born in the twentieth year of Daoguang. In the twenty-second year, the Opium War occurred, and the Treaty of Nanjing was signed with the British. I was just three years old. Near the north gate of the city wall in Zhenjiang, there was a barbershop. At that time, the custom was for everyone to take a water pipe and smoke water tobacco. One day, the barber, because he had no distinguished customers, took a water pipe and strolled up the city wall for a leisurely walk, with a paper torch between his fingers. Suddenly, he saw a cannon on the wall, loaded with gunpowder and fuse, but no soldiers guarding it. The barber suddenly became excited and casually lit the fuse with the paper torch in his hand. Before he knew it, there was a deafening explosion, scaring the barber to run away for his life. That year was the Opium War. The British soldiers were so fierce at that time, attacking Wusongkou, occupying Shanghai, and then attacking Zhenjiang. Just at that moment, a ship was anchored in the middle of the river when suddenly a cannonball grazed past the mast. The officers on the ship were greatly surprised and secretly thought that China was not to be trifled with, it was terrible, terrible, so they decided to head downstream... This was later told to me by my friend Yang Gushan, who was eight years older than me and witnessed it personally!"</p>
<p>If this kind of story were written into history, it would be like the "wind reversed, and all the grain rose up" in the "Golden Coffer" chapter of the Book of Documents, or like what Shi Kefa reported to Dorgon: "Tens of thousands of logs of Phoebe zhennan emerged from the Yangtze River to help build palaces," and "When the congratulatory message was raised, purple clouds covered the sky," all such tales of "heaven and man returning." Both Mr. Xiang and Mr. Yang were children at that time, so what they saw is not something we need to discuss for now. However, I always thought it was somewhat disrespectful that an eighty-year-old man still regarded it as credible history. The same book also quotes Mr. Liu Chengyu's "Record of Mr. Xiang's Knowledge and Oral Narratives at Ninety-Eight Years Old," which records Lin Zexu's defense at the seacoast: "At that time, Lin Zexu gained a reputation for being tough on foreign countries because he burned opium. In reality, he did not understand foreign affairs and ultimately caused maritime conflict. There is an interesting story about this campaign. Lin Zexu arranged large vats on the Guangzhou city wall, pretending they were giant cannons. British warships, using telescopes, thought that the great country of China must have military cannons, so they hesitated and retreated. At that time, Herdt and William, two British scholars studying in China who were fluent in Chinese, were practicing on warships. They said that China did not have such cannons, so they devised a plan to investigate. Under the moonlight, they secretly attacked with a small warship, aiming at the mouth of the vats and firing the ship's cannons at them. The giant vats shattered into pieces, and the British laughed loudly and entered Guangzhou."</p>
<p>Even if Lin Zexu did not understand the enemy's situation, he would not have been so absurd. Isn't this just a rustic saying from a village school, or a "chamber pot formation" designed by a pedantic scholar? Liang Yanzhan's "Record of the Yi Threat" records that as soon as Lin arrived in Guangdong, he first investigated the situation at the seacoast, the location of the forts, and presented detailed diagrams. He also bought more than two hundred Western cannons and distributed them to various forts at the ports. How could he have used giant vats to make up the numbers? Later, when the war broke out, Lin also created a method of fire ships. Taking advantage of the dark moon and low tide, they suddenly attacked the enemy ships. They split up and secretly emerged, attacking the head and tail of the enemy ships with the wind behind them. All the fire weapons were thrown from the masts, preventing the enemy ships from escaping. Many British ships suffered setbacks, which is enough to prove that Lin was not a pedantic scholar but an expert in tactics. Moreover, at that time, the British had not yet attacked the provincial capital, so the story of arranging vats is just an embellishment. On the other hand, after Lin was transferred away and replaced by Qishan, the old general Yang Fang from Hunan was sent to Guangzhou to resist the enemy. He really made a big joke with the chamber pot formation. Page 38 of the previous book (published by the Peiping Research Institute, Commercial Press edition) says: "When Fang first arrived, he entered through Foshankou. The people longed for this experienced general, hoping for him like the years. The cheers never stopped wherever he went, and the officials also relied on him as a great wall. After entering the city, he immediately proposed that the Yi cannons always hit us, but we cannot hit the Yi. We are based on solid ground, while the Yi are in the turbulent waves. The host and guest have different forms, how can we be sure of victory? There must be evil cults who are good at spells hidden within them. He ordered the neighborhood chiefs to collect the nearby women's chamber pots as apotropaic objects. He loaded them on wooden rafts and sent them out to defend against Wuyong. He ordered a lieutenant to lead it, with soldiers ambushing on the other side of the river. They agreed that when the cannon fired, they would immediately raise the rafts and line them up on the water's edge with the chamber pot mouths facing the enemy's path, and then they would attack from the raft and sandwich them. When the Yi arrived, they used a telescope to measure the rafts arranged horizontally on the shore. As they approached, the lieutenant had already seen the flags and fled first. There was no one on the rafts, so they drove straight in..."</p>
<p>The two stories are very similar. It is possible that Mr. Xiang heard the rumor and added it to Lin Zexu's story. Originally, there were too many people like Ye Mingchen at that time, so we cannot blame later generations for making presumptuous speculations.</p>
<h3 id="e144">He Tianjian's Painting Exhibition <a href="#e144" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c144" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">144</a></h3>
<p>Wang Wei's paintings have poetry in the paintings, and Lu You's poems have paintings in the poems. The cultivation that a successful painter should have, in addition to skill in painting, should be reading ten thousand books and travelling ten thousand miles, because art is born from emotion, and the elements of emotion are intertwined with "experience" and "observation." As the "Origin of the Way" in "The Literary Mind and the Carving of Dragons" says, "When viewing mountains, emotions fill the mountains; when viewing the sea, emotions fill the sea." Expressing talent and spreading fragrance must rely on rivers and mountains. No wonder Lu You, witnessing the difficulties of the times, had the emotion of "Merit and literature are waning, and it is not enough to just look at the mountains in old age." Poetry expresses intentions, and writing expresses emotions. The highest realm of art is, after all, reaching the same goal by different paths.</p>
<p>Mr. He Tianjian is a painter who possesses the dual conditions of a literati and an artist. He has travelled almost all the famous mountains and rivers in the country. His paintings come from accumulated knowledge and experimentation. Throughout his life, he values integrity and does not take shortcuts. Some people say that he is derived from Jing Hao, Guan Tong, Dong Yuan, and Ju Ran, but I dare not say that. Let the people who appreciate the paintings go to the Daxin Art Gallery to experience it.

<p>— Zhang Yiqu</p>
<p>The second son of Speaker Pan, brother Weizhen, unfortunately died suddenly of typhoid fever yesterday morning.</p>
<p>Medicine was ineffective, and I am deeply saddened.</p>
<p>Young and promising, he succumbed to illness! The tragic news brings many feelings: The regret of a thousand autumns is beyond medicine, and the heartache of this day is still about war. His future held soaring aspirations, but his passing is unbearable. The elderly parents are heartbroken, speechless as they ask the sky what happened!</p>
<p>###</p>
<p>Last year, the Zhejiang natives in the old capital customarily held a public sacrifice to the virtuous people of their province at the Guangxian Shrine. Suddenly, one person seized the spirit tablet of a worthy person from the local region, threw it to the ground, and stomped on it. The crowd was not surprised or stopped him, and even regarded it as a matter of course. This spirit tablet belonged to Wang Shitong, also known as Shuheng, who was the father of Wang Yintai. Since the son had been imprisoned for being a traitor, the father could not receive the sound of incense and worship from the people of the region. A joker said that this was certainly in accordance with the old-style opening remark of a case, "The unfilial son's sins are deep and heavy, and he does not perish himself, bringing disaster to his eminent father," truly a tragic comedy. According to reason, the sins of the father and son are not related. Even for the great traitors of previous dynasties, such as the case of Nian Gengyao during the Yongzheng era, the criminal officials initially proposed that his father, Nian Xialing, should be punished quickly, but a certain minister argued that Xialing was not aware of the situation, and the court governed the world with filial piety, how could it punish the father because of the son? Therefore, Xialing was acquitted. Moreover, Wang Shitong had passed away several years before the July 7th Incident, and Yintai's assumption of a false position was even more unrelated. Therefore, whether his spirit tablet should be implicated in the crime of treason and overthrown is a matter for further study. Insiders believe that the question is not whether Yintai is a traitor or not, but the extent of Shitong's "virtue" and his qualification for entry into the shrine.</p>
<p>According to the shrine, it is used to honor virtue and repay merit, and to be a model for future generations to admire and emulate. Therefore, there must be outstanding manifestations that are admired by public opinion, and then there can be a way to secure his position. According to the records of previous dynasties, there are two main types of shrines: (1) those that are granted by the court, such as "accompanying the ancestral temple" and "entering the shrine of virtuous people," which are decided solely by the emperor's edict, and the scholars and people have no way to question them and are indifferent to them. (2) Those that are supported by public opinion, such as "local worthies" and "famous officials," whose qualifications for being enshrined are found in the Complete Book of Academic Administration, namely: "There must be obvious virtue and outstanding behavior, that are consistent with name and reality, and agreed upon by public opinion"; "If the nomination is not true, the local officials and the reporting gentry will be punished." Therefore, in the fifth year of Guangxu, the people of Anhui falsely used Wang Yin's name to jointly request that the former Governor of Sichuan, Wu Tang, be entered into the local worthies shrine. Wang Yin flew from Zhejiang to report to the Governor of Anhui that he was a distant official and was not in the province, and that he had never known about this matter. The Governor of Anhui reported this to the emperor, which became a laughing stock. In addition, after the death of a local official, some local officials and gentry requested that he be recorded as a famous official, but the case was reported by officials and gentry in Beijing and cancelled. There must be morals and scholarship that are examples for the masses for local worthies, and there must be achievements in governing that bring practical benefits to the people for famous officials, and it cannot be forced by power or personal friendship.</p>
<p>Wang Shitong's original name was Yitong (later changed to Shi because of avoiding Puyi's name). He made his mark in Fenyang, Shanxi, originally from Shaoxing, Zhejiang. He passed the Guangxu Xinmao examination and the Wuxu Jinshi examination. He rose from the position of secretary in the Ministry of Justice to the position of judge and censor in the Supreme Court. During the Republic of China, he entered Yuan Shikai's presidential palace as a secretary, and later succeeded Zhang Yiying as the director of the secretarial bureau. This person was known to Zhang Baixi in the Qing Dynasty and was responsible for running schools. Zhang and Yuan were in-laws. Yuan's appreciation of Wang was only because his documents were stable and skillful, he was cautious in dealing with matters, and he knew some allusions, which could be used as a tool, which was not the same as Liang Shiyi, the secretary-general who planned the political situation. Later, he also served as the director of the Water Conservancy Bureau, a leisurely position. His son, Yintai, studied in Europe and gradually became established. In the sixteenth year of the Republic of China, he was even promoted to Minister of Foreign Affairs by Zhang Zuolin. Wang retired and lived a leisurely life, growing old under the window. In summary, his life was not enough to be a "traitor," and he could not be considered "virtuous." Yintai, relying on his power and position, promoted him to the shrine, which was considered a way of showing filial piety, but in fact it was not only useless, but even if there was no problem of treason, no interesting drama of overthrowing the spirit tablet, he would still inevitably be met with the white eyes of the people of the region. Therefore, it is said that the mistake was in the timing of entering the shrine.</p>
