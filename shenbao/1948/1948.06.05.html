<h3>對學生反美扶日運動　美大使發表聲明　外部今重申我對日立場</h3>
<p>〔本報南京四日電〕司徒大使四日上午十一時，在美大使館招待中外記者，對從事反美扶日運動之學生，提出忠吿之聲明。司使聲明，係經美國務院核准。首都官方反響大致良好。外部發言人宣稱：將於五日發佈聲明，重申中國對於日本問題一事之立塲，反對美國對日政策之觀點，以廓淸共匪陰謀主使之煽動性宣傳。俾純潔學生及社會人士，了解事實之眞象，藉免此事續被共匪運用為離間中美友誼之工具。</p>
<p>政府要員之意見</p>
<p>此外記者並走訪政府重要官員，詢以彼等之意見。行政院長翁文灝稱，希望學生能因司徒大使之忠吿，有所覺悟。今日為對共產黨徒作殊死鬥爭之時代，萬不可更為野心者煽動利用。中國對日本問題，向有不變之獨立立塲，絕非肩從美國。靑年學生及社會人士，應力避受反美宣傳之迷惑。政委董顯光則稱，中國政府對於藉口日本問題從事反美之不逞活動，決予制止。敎長朱家驊則以渠於打消辭意後四日始返部辦公，對學生是項活動尙待瞭解。然敎部方面對之業加注意。司徒大使聲明所中吿之對象，以學生團體為主，故工商界在京人士尙無何反應。唯某對日外交前輩對記者稱：反美·及扶日為兩事，於月前之世局下，以任何莫須有之理由，進行反美，均係違反世界大勢，及國家利益之不智行動，不足為訓，然扶日之舉，則不論中國政府及國民，均難苟同。以近時日本之行為觀之，日本如稍被縱容，極易重行步上經濟侵略之途。幸目前所謂斯揣克計劃，德萊柏計劃猶不過為少數官員之報吿，尙未被美國政府採為改變對日政策之原則，否則日本狡計得售，固非中國所願，亦並非世界之福。故於對日政策方面，我國必須堅守立塲，外交當局允宜有所聲明，以昭吿國民及世人。</p>
<p>我對日政策不變</p>
<p>〔本報南京四日電〕關於美國扶植日本事，各方頻傳反對之聲。外交界某權威人士頃就外交觀點對記者談我國對日政策稱：我對日政策早經確定，不論其他國家政策如何，我均保持下列兩項原則：（一）在對日和會中，我必保留爭取否決權。（二）對日本之處理政策，我向主寬大，惟寬大之意義，並非容許日本重建武力，恢復侵略力量，而為使日本保持和平與民主，在和平民主範圍內，使日人能獲合乎水準之生活。</p>
<p>司使聲明之內容</p>
<p>〔本報南京四日電〕美駐華大使司徒雷登四日晨在美大使館記者招待會中發表聲明，（略稱）：本人茲被迫以眞摯沉重之心情公開承認，一種日益增長之危險局面。此種局面，不僅影響美國利益，亦且影響中國之切身利益。本人所言者，自係指及美國對日政策之運動。</p>
<p>予不佯作知悉何人發起此項運動，及其目的何在。金所確知者，即此舉對中美間之　統睦誼，實有嚴重之損害。倘仍繼續進行可能招致不幸之結果。尤令人遣憾者，乃此種舉動竟於美國現正着手於廣泛而鄭重之計劃，以協助陷於悲慘環境中國時發生。</p>
<p>本人雅不欲相信各發起及附和反美運動之大學，確信其所用以反對本國之理由。本國被指為扶植日本，恢復其軍閥與經濟帝國主義。此種指摘顯屬錯誤。查於勝利結束對日戰爭後，美國旋即代表摧毀日本武力之各盟國，着手解除日本陸海空軍及參謀之機構。余以為無任何人能提出日本軍力之任何部份，現正予以恢復之證據。亦無任何人能提出美國有使日本軍力永不再起以外任何用意之證據。查日本侵略之基礎，係在其本土以外之帝國統治地，現日本旣已失去其帝國統治地，非有軍力無法重行建立。美國人民及政府決不使其能有所為，諸君儘可安心。</p>
<p>至於日本之經濟及工業能力。美國亦曾代表各盟國着手破壞或拆毀其戰時工業，吾人現遭遇一種形勢，而必須恢復日本之經濟，至日人能以自給之程度。蓋無人能期望美國賦稅之担負者，無限期繼續支付日人之費用。必須予日本以自給之機會，否則日本不僅對美國，即對中國亦將為一種延續之担負。按不能自存之國家，乃維持安全與和平之威脅。不能自存之國民，將永不能成為愛好和平與有民主思想之國民。</p>
<p>如使日人成為飢餓不安之人民，則日本亦將續為和平之威脅。此種情形適為共產主義之所需。如吾人誠意為一般利益計，必須制止共產主義，則吾人必須消滅鼓勵共產主義之因素。，諸君奧美國人民對日本之關切，實屬相同。吾人不欲有一共產之日本，而防止此種災禍最妥善之方法，則為使日人能自謀生計</p>
<p>司使答記者詢問</p>
<p>司使於宣　其　為準備之聲明後，並答　忍者之詢問。其　記者之主夢　答　次：</p>
<p>問：關於昨日中央日報社論「論反美運動」所提之四項問題，大使可否表示意見？</p>
<p>答：無意見。</p>
<p>問：以大使觀測，中國政府有無指使此次反美運動之行動。</p>
<p>答；中國政府從未指使此運動</p>
<p>問：貴國政府擬否向中國政府提出抗議？</p>
<p>答：美政府無此準備。</p>
<p>問：大使談話中曾提及，學生反美運動倘仍繼續，將引起若干不幸後果，所謂「不幸後果」可否加以說明？</p>
<p>答：（由美使館發言人代答）目前美國人民，正以極熱誠情緒繳納額外稅，以加强援華，倘學生「反美運動」仍行繼續，則此種熱誠的情緒，可能有所更改。</p>

<p>社論反美扶日與反美運動的辨明　——讀司徒大使聲明以後</p>
<p>最近美國朝　對於扶植日本的論竊，日見露骨，乃引起我國一些士關於美國對日政策的疑慮和批評；詎意「反對美國扶植日本」的論調，竟為我國內各大學少數學生所利用，以此為口號，在全國各地鼓動學潮，造成了目前的「反美逐動」，如火如茶，蔓延各地，頗有日益擴大的危險；若不早日設法過制，恐將造成不幸的後果。司徒大使特於昨日上午在南京招待中外記者，發表書面聲明，我們把原文反覆誦讀，綜合其要點如次：</p>
<p>（一）反美運動所造成的危險局面，不僅影響美國利益，抑且中國的重要利益，也受其影響；（二）雖不欲知何方鼓動「反美運動」及其目的何在，但深信此項運動，對於中美兩國問之傳統友誼，實有嚴重之損書，個任其繼續進行，則勢必造成非常不幸之後果；（五）各大學生指斥美國扶植日本恢復軍事的經濟的帝國主義，均屬　構，實無人能提出確實證據；（四）若謂日本經濟之恢復，即足以構成對中國和平之威脅，亦非的論，如使日人亦成為飢餓不安之人，則日本將續為和平之威脅，適足為共產主義求之不得者也，如為一般利益計，必需制止共產主養，吾人亦須消滅鼓勵共產主義之因素；（五）黽勉中國學生忠己愛國，中國需要學生之忠實努力；（六）最後宣示大使之最大願望，乃在全人類的和平與幸福，中美兩國若不能相處以誠，互相友好，互相信任，則必危及人類之和平與　福。</p>
<p>司徒大使的書面聲明，充滬了熱情，實在太勸人了，不僅語重心長，而且完全是肺腑之言。凡是善良的中國人民，　了他的聲明原文，沒有不被感勵痛哭流淚的。但　我們為了澄　目前的局勢起且，我們不得不再　陳者平事實，以正中美兩國人士的視聽。</p>
<p>第一，今日評論反美運動，必須分辨兩個性暫　然不同的事實。一個是少數學生所鼓動的反美運動，另一個　社會一些人士關於美國對日政策的疑慮和批評；這兩個性質截然不同的事實，是絕對不可混為一談的。關於前者，是由少數學生假借「反對美國扶植日本」的題目而發揮出來的一種運動，他們不是為了中國的利益，而是為了共產國際的陰謀。中共發起反美運動，遠在兩年以前，近來因為美蘇關係的惡化以及美國積極在軍事上經濟上援助中國國民政府的緣故，中共的反美運動，也就變本加厲了，而今這少數職業學生甘心為共匪軍事間諜，遇有這樣好的機會，自然要利用一般人關於美國對日政策的疑慮心理，大施其鼓動反美運動的技倆。他們的目的，顯而易見，一方面企圖轉移中國人民的視綫，集中到日本侵略列車再度開動的未來遠景，而忽視了我國東北領土主權的正適受到損害；另一方面則欲離間中美兩國的密切邦交，企圖破壞美國援華計劃的實施·所以在司徒　　　明裏的響語，例如『中國的重要利益也受其影響」，『個性其　　進行，則勢必造成不幸的後果』……等等，不特不能使這少數職業學生有所畏懼，適足以鼓勵他們的　鐵活動，因為他們的目的，根本就不是為了中國的利益，他們正是要中國重要剩益受到損害，正是　造成不幸的後果。　　衆院撥款委員會　　　金削减六千三百萬美元的一項消息，在這些反美的　　學生　來，正可以　幸他們反嘆戴動的大成功？司徒大使　　洞悉中國的政　，了解人民的心理；但對於這　搬　的作用，或許還不能認職淸楚。所以我們不能不特別指出，並　　從大使曁　國人士，對於反美扶日興反美運動　　　然　　的　優能有所分辨，千萬不能混為一談。</p>
<p>第二，美國近來的對日政策，尤其史特萊克的反賠償論，屈拉勃的不賠償論，對於日本的工業水準，對於日本的賠價問題，均主張大大的放鬆，此其後果，不僅使中國在物質上遭受重大損失，而且中國人民行見敵人的東山再起，在精神上也感受威脅。中國人民的疑慮，是必然的現象，是無法消除的；但是一般人的活動；只限於意見的提眾，絕無反美的意味；而且他們聽了司徒大使的聲明，閘明美國的　日政策，初無扶植日本恢復軍事的經濟的帝國主議之意，所有一切疑懼，自然也可以渙然冰釋了。不過一般人對於麥帥的管制日本，對其已有的成就，雖也表示欽佩；但是終學得「君子可欺其方」麥帥有受日人欺騙之虞。中國對於日本初無報復之意，但求遠東和平獲有切實保障，此與美國對於日本的願望，初無二致的，所以我們仍希望美國能　全中國的利益，注蠶中國人民的心理，提高對日本的警覺，以防日本侵略勢力的再起。</p>
<p>第三，這次全國各大學少數學生鼓動反美運動，可使美國朝野獲得一個珍貴的敎訓，這就是中國共匪與美國在遠東利益的不能共存；今日共　雖然尙未能奪取得中國政權；但其排斥美國在遠東利益的野心，卻已昭然若搗的了。中國政權若一旦為共廳奪取，我們不難想象，美國勢必被排斥於遠東的門外，對於遠樂的和平與安定，絕不容許其　一辭。這個事實戰一般的明顯，美國若欲　其對遠東和平所負的責任，則加緊援助中州　日完成戡亂建國的任務，實為美國在遠東唯一的出路。所以我們希望司徒大使，能有遠大的卓見，共匪利用職業學生反美國是激烈，美國援華計劃的進行愈要積極，千萬不能因少數職業學生的鼓動反美而寬弛其對華的援助。而中共匪嫁　中國政府的毒計。</p>
<p>最後，我們還得要向國人說幾句話，中國目前的許多困難問題，一時雖都不易解決，足以引為當前的　憂；但是我國局勢的眞正危機，却在國人　於任何問題都沒有一個公正健全的輿論，即以此項反　美國扶　日本問題而論，因為沒有公正健全的輿論，不僅沒有提高國人翰　於日本的警覺，運用國民外交的途徑，喚起美國對日政策的自覺；反而為職業學生所利用，使問題的本身也變了質，引起中美兩國人士不愉快的感覺；中國知職份子不能做中流砥柱，挽回狂瀾，對於這次反美運動的發生及擴大，實不能辭其咎；這是値得全國的智識份子深切反省的。</p>

<h3>削減援外款項妨碍稪興　美國務卿表示反對　美國違反諾言以自損令譽　眾院撥款會建議引反響</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕紐約四日廣播：華盛頓訊，馬歇爾國務卿本日在記者招待會上稱，衆院撥款委會削减對歐經濟援助之數額後，將使歐洲復興計劃失刊其建設性質而成為一種救濟計劃，政府方面將竭力使其不致削减。</p>
<p>〔路透社華盛頓三日電〕衆院撥款委員會頃建議削减美政府所建議馬　爾方案及其他援外法案之數額百分之廿五，該項建議同時適用於援華計劃及歐洲復興方案。撥款委會該項建議見諸該會通過之撥款案內，規定至一九四九年七月卅一日止之十五個月內，對外全部援助費五十九億八千零七十一萬元。該會將對歐援助額减至四十億元，計較原數减少二億四千五百萬元將援華額减至四億元較原數减少六千三百萬元，（關於援華部份參看第一版）减少之數雖僅為原數之百分之七，然以國會通過之案原係供十二個月之用，而撥款委員會之建議則係作為十五個月內之用途，故實際上乃係較原額减少百分之廿五。該會釋明减少數額及延長使用期之理由，謂援外計劃之原來三意，原不允支出較根據明智的基礎所應供給者更多的費用。如在一九四九年七月一日以前發生緊急狀態，國會將於明年一月間開會時再採必要行動。國會人士相信衆議院必將接受撥款委會之建議，而通過削减後的撥款案。參院撥款委會對援外法案之撥款案尙在審查階段，政府方面相信，參議院必能恢復一部份之原來撥款。衆院撥款委會釋明削减之理由時，指出一九四五年七月一日以來，美國付出援外額一百八十一億八千二百萬元，旣削弱美國資源，復有一部份被浪費。該會之報吿並對使國外農村機械化之計劃表示不滿，對西德之善後工作亦有批評。關於援助希土額之削減，侮因前此對該兩國已有鉅額援助之故。</p>
<p>〔路透社華盛頓三日電〕眾院撥款委會宣布削減援外數額後，經濟合作總署署長霍夫曼即召集記者發表談話，指出援歐數額之削减，將影響歐洲十六國復興之機會。歐洲復興計劃需要總數五十三億元之數不能减少。目前之希望僅此於參院之得以恢復原來經國會通過之數額。參院外委會主席范登堡因此正與參院撥款委會主席勃里奇討論此事，希望參院撥款委會不致有大量削减。關係方面謂馬歇爾·霍夫曼，甚至杜魯門，將於日內向國會施用壓力，以謀减少衆院撥款委會此舉之危險性，而防止對歐洲民氣可能引起的反響。</p>
<p>〔中央社紐約四日專電〕素具國際觀念之「紐約時報」頃批評衆院撥款委會削减已由國會通過之援外款項一舉；該報謂，此種削减不啻違反美國已作之諾言，以及國會之意志。「紐約時報」指責衆院撥款委會主席泰勃應負其咎，蓋渠對削减援外款項，素負大部分責任也。該報謂援外一端至為重要，不容泰勃狹窄之作風隨意處置。吾人料想參衆兩院及整個共和黨必須負起彼等之責任，否決泰勃之行動，而尊重彼等所作之諾言，藉以保全美國外交政策之令譽。</p>
<h3>蘇對西方「冷」突趨沉寂　基本政策將改變　一般認局勢有轉機之象</h3>
<p>〔合眾社紐約四日電〕霍華德系報紙國外編輯西姆斯報吿：「僉信克林姆宮正計劃更改基本政策，允為蘇聯於一九三九年放棄與英法修好而聯合納粹德國以來最重大之轉變。鐵幕外各國來訊均稱，蘇聯對西方之冷戰突然沉寂，英國及十六個馬歇爾計劃國家來訊透露一般局勢大有轉機，為對德勝利以來所僅見？蘇聯以西各國共黨亦减少活動，目前蘇聯在西歐之第五縱隊腦海中，似已有甜密之合理精神。</p>
<p>各地觀察家報吿西歐之戰爭談論已稍見减退，然亦有人稱，私下仍有相信此係大風暴前之沉寂者。克林姆宮必將作一決定恐不日即有分曉。此決議之震驚世界性殆可前定。除非史達林及其政治局同伴議決共產主義及自由企業，在同一世界上能和平相處而修正其征服世界政策，否則彼等必定儘早動手，並且必須敲得重，否則一且世界開始復興，彼等將無力加以阻擋</p>

<p>〔路透社海爾辛基三日電〕芬蘭外交部今日宣布：蘇聯政府業已決定取消根據休戰協定及和約芬蘭應對蘇聯給付而尙未付出之一部份賠償。取消之部份價値約七千萬元。按芬蘭原應於一九四四年起之八年內，對蘇給付一九三八年價格之價値三億元之賠償物，對芬蘭經濟自為一大負担。蘇聯此舉，自為一般芬人所歡迎，然其他方面亦有謂蘇聯此舉意在支援芬蘭共黨參加七月一日之普選者。芬共於去歲十一月之市議會選舉中曾受挫敗，料在此次普選中亦難望佔有上風。金九金奎植意見一致</p>

<p>〔路透社倫敦三日電〕英國已於二日根據安全理事會於五星二十日通過之聖地休戰決議，宣布對中東區實施絕對的軍火禁運，英商務部所頒之軍火禁遝令，包括英國根據條約對中東阿拉伯國家供給之戰爭供應物品，其中包括可作軍用之工業用炸藥在內。</p>
<p>按英國於今年二月初，即已對巴勒斯坦境內之任何一方頒佈軍火絕對禁運令，惟該一禁令並不適用於與英訂有供給戰　條約之各阿拉伯國。英政府此次決議，係根據安理會五。卅決議第三項之規定，該項云：在休戰之四星期內，各有關政府及當局，不得對巴勒斯坦或阿拉伯國輸不輸出戰爭川具。商務部所頒禁遝令，梵運之項目，包括飛機，飛機引擎及零件，刺刀，炸彈，及轟炸儀器，砲，火器，機關槍，及彈匣，炸藥，導炸綫，手溜彈，地雷，水雷，噴火器，魚雷，及若干軍用瓦斯。本社外交記者稱：英商務部此項禁令，乃英政府根據安理會決議，所採之第二步措施。第一步措施乃昨日宣布之禁止及齡猶太壯丁，於休戰期內，自英國領土內前往巴勒斯坦。此間外交界人士並曰：英國於安理會之休戰令開始實行以前，係表示相信聯合國斡旋專員貝那多特，必能完成其使命。</p>

<h3>巴拉圭革命　總統被陸軍推翻</h3>

<p>總統認為茲善性質之救濟尙不足解決問題，必須予以積極性之協助，始克有濟。職是之故，美國人民必須協助彼等，使其能自給自足，自合其力。論及共產主義問題時，總統認為僅藉通過法律以防其活動，至多祗能應其從事地下活動，並不足以根本解決問題。　吾人對一般人民之生活不能處應顧及，則必　致共產主義之活躍。總統謂共產主義係孱弱。愁苦與失望之產物，在健全之社會中不能存在。抵抗共產主義之最有效方法，厥為不斷改進吾人之民主政治，諸如改善人民之衛生·敎育·公平之工資制度，通貨膨脹之防止，均屬必要之舉。總統最後表示信心，認為美國必能達到此等目的。</p>

<h3>銷美本色絲綢　交涉減低稅率</h3>
<p>〔本報南京四日電〕我國所產本色絲綢，在美國市塲頗有需要，惟因美國目前本色絲綢，進口稅率較染色及印花綢為高，致我國本色絲綢無法在美銷售，其原因係因美所有對外稅則協定中，對於本色絲綢未訂列優惠條款，故稅率較染色及印花綢高百分之三十至四十，輸管會已建議經部，請外部向美政府正式交涉减低此項半製品之稅率，以維我國絲業特產，而利爭取外匯。現經部已請外部等有關機關，進行交涉</p>

<p>麵粉　在此新麥登塲之先，內地價格平平，故市上人心不活，散戶意冷，出多而進稀。北帮袖手，交易不吒，價格微有升沉。老車粉削萬元，兵船粉平平，中信局按原價拋出九千二百包，雜牌粉大都疲落。麩皮平定，小麥廠盤仍站二七〇萬原盤。</p>
<p>雜糧　堅穩，黃豆後市較堅，因客帮有納，故市勢堅挺。漢口乍豆以三百六十萬收市，挺升十萬元，杜豆不加。苞米續上日之漲勢，再見上挺，再加十萬·紅糧·新元麥·新蠶·等均稱堅定，菉豆客帮擇中次貨納取，市平平。芝蔴少見榮辱，生仁做開甚少，本街零銷價升</p>
<p>食油　開市高，收市轉平，略見砌高，晨開續上日之漲勢，貨主仍岡扳高。大有豆油以一千六百二十萬開市，收市步退至一千五百八十萬元，高於上日十五萬元。生油挺二十萬，成交不多。生菜油等一致高一二十萬，獨小車蔴油後市反挫二十萬，豆餅廠方無供，市盤旋高檔略堅一二萬。</p>
<h3>糖價平穩</h3>
<p>糖市前日續升後，落無多。昨已趨平。公會劃盤上現貨二四粗白為九百六十萬元，升五萬元。四半白一千零七十五萬元，小五萬元。廿號中砂白無上落，其餘土糖如汕提靑刁靑及興化白等，無甚軒輊。惟海南赤見緊，高貨開六百零五萬元，普通五百七十五萬元至五百八十一萬元，統共成交八九百件。</p>
<h3>貨款交付辦法　糧業有新決定</h3>

<p>本市雜糧粉麩油業三公會理監事，三市塲管理委員聯席會議，於昨（四）日下午三時在民國路三七七號雜糧市塲內舉行。出席者張超傅昌裕程楨祥等五十餘人由傅昌裕分張超任主席。首先由主席報吿，自金融當局實施當日票據禁止抵用後，同業雖多以本票為交割籌碼，但當日劃綫支票，一如買方須趕至銀行掉換本票，勢已不及，致有延遲交割等事發生，影響營業至鉅。特請各出席代表共同商討貨款收交具體辦法。經各代表發表意見後，當經決議，雜糧市塲交易付款辦法，當日成交之貨物，買進者應於上午十一時前交付，賣出者次日劃綫支票之八成貨款。粉麩油業兩市塲，則付以次日劃綫支票之全部貨款。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕輸管會限額分配處頃奉命趕辦附表（二）類商品第五季限額分配工作，預計可於一週內辦竣。並分別發出限額通知醫，送達工廠用戶及合格進口商，俾按照所得配額向該處申請，按附表（二）類第五六兩季限額，行政院於本年二月間公佈為七三，四七六，〇〇〇美元，內第五季佔半數，計為三六，七三八，〇〇〇美元，公佈後因外匯因難，迄今方能分配。</p>
<h3>外幣存單抵用辦法　毛紡業請收回成命</h3>
<p>自備外匯之特種外幣存單，中央銀行，輸管會，中信局等三機關，已商定抵用新辦法，仍須由原進口商附具結匯證明書。毛紡織業獲悉後，認為增加該業困難，表示不能接受。特於昨晨（四日）推派代表陳元欽，唐華如。楊立人，葉亦康等四人，分赴輸管會，中央銀行請求收回成命。該業提出之要求，即手續尙未完淸者，照新辦法辦理。其已按照規定完淸一切手續者，則請仍准按原辦法。該業貨品於中信局收購時即已照起岸價格增加百分之一百五十，今應得之特種外幣存單，再須附具結滙證明書，則有礙該業之生存，故力請收回成命。</p>

<h3>大專運動會第一日　大學院專兩組　約翰國醫領先　女生組滬江立信分佔優勢</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕第三屆本市專科以上學校聯合運動會，於昨日下午一時在江灣市體育塲揭幕，參加大學專校計十八個之多，男女遲動員四百餘人，為大專運動會初見之盛况。開幕儀式由主席交大校長程孝剛致開幕辭，繼由吳市長代表王冠靑參專致訓詞，簡單隆重，繼即開始比賽。</p>
<p>第一日競賽結果，大學組男子組約翰以二十九分半佔得優勢，同濟十九分，滬江十四分，交通十二分，追隨於後，惟相距達十分之多，冠軍當以約翰呼聲最高。女子組滬江九分居前，次為大夏八分，約翰光華暨南各得六分，冠軍將有一番劇烈競爭。院專組男子　組國防醫學院人才清濟一馬當先，得三十一分之多，立信二十一分，上法二十分，今日與國醫院將有熱烈之角逐。女子組立信得三十一分，冠軍當無問題，國防醫學院僅得六分，上法三分。體專組僅東亞一校，並不計分，表演而已。</p>
<p>第一日各項成績平平，當以各校缺少訓練所致，惟四百米接力，大學男子組約翰以四十七秒五，打破大會四十八秒七之大專紀錄，較為生色。體專組表演，成績較一般為優異，惟無競爭對象，不無美中不足。</p>
<p>今日下午二時起，賡續在原處舉行，賽畢當塲給獎閉幕。</p>

<h3>印華代表團　昨今離滬南返</h3>
<p>印尼華僑參加七屆全運代表團，於昨今兩日，分批搭機飛港，昨日　滬者男女選手四十餘人今日二十餘人，由領隊丘佐榮事領，於晨六時半啓程，全部選手在港聚集後，於九日搭郵船返排爪哇。據丘領隊臨行對記者談：此次回國參加全運，蒙祖國各界及體育新聞界人士或予獎飾，或予指導，均深感謝，臨行怱促，未獲走辭，尤深歉仄云云。</p>
<h3>甘肅全運選手　惲瑛今日安葬</h3>
<p>甘肅省全運選手惲瑛，不幸於上月病逝滬上，惲君生前友好，定今日下午一時，在國華殯儀館舉行臨葬前之祭禮，下午三時落葬於安平公墓。</p>
<h3>會場花絮録</h3>
<p>啦啦隊的吶喊，是這次運動會較七屆全運特出的唯一現象。滬江和約翰兩校都有啦啦隊，前者人數衆多，比較出色，但每因運動員不爭氣，啦啦隊也未免遜色了。</p>
<p>運動衣以白底紅字的最多：同濟，上法，師專，滬江，大夏等均然，約翰和牙專都是紅底白字，交大藍衣黃字，曁大全身漆黑，最易鑑別。</p>
<p>同濟麥明達和潘正明，號碼為一號與二號，兩人於跳高決賽時，忽然想起，不禁相對微笑，最後果然奪得第一二名，可謂巧合。</p>
<p>約大運動員中，有兩個碧眼兒，鮑萊和彭三弟，前者以籃球及三鐵著，後者參加千五百米徑賽，並無精彩表演。</p>
<p>徑賽裁判劉荷生，對運動員之偷步，備加挖苦，與對未偸步者，十分體惜。</p>
<p>各校校旗十六面，一字橫排，五色繽紛，其中約翰校旗最小，同德醫學院院旗最為觸目。</p>
<p>昨日開會儀式，最為簡單，程會長之演說，辭短意長，各健兒在烈日下，站立僅數分鐘，感激良深，實為運動會開幕儀式之良好榜樣，値得提倡。</p>
<p>司令台缺乏麥風，報吿員手執喇叭筒大喊，聲斯力竭。大會缺少個指揮的靈魂實為美中不足，據說並不是省錢，而是缺電</p>
<p>分組太多，利弊不一，利者大家可得分，皆大歡嘉，弊者精神渙散，不能集中，新聞記者弄得頭目昏花，第一日一天，決賽項目，共達三十項之多，可謂洋洋大觀。</p>
<p>十八個大學參加的運動會，規模可謂不小，但是種種設備欠周，連得幾位會長副會長的大學校長先生，坐都沒有椅子坐，在司令台上國團轉。據說是經費不充足的緣故。</p>
<p>一般成績的低落，不像一個大學聯合運動會，沒有訓練是最大原因，學校當局和體育主任要負些責任。</p>
<p>體專組祇東亞一校參加表演，好像大會中插八一個東亞體專運動會。</p>
<p>有幾位運動小姐，穿着便服，作壁上觀，並未參加表演，一顯身手，殊為憾事。據敎練吿記者，均係因女兒家常事，無可避免。</p>
<p>西司令專前共有大小　賬五隻，計約翰一隻，光華二隻，同濟二隻，北面還有小帳六隻，是東亞體專童子軍的大本營。</p>

<h3>守溫韵學殘卷所題「南梁」考</h3>
<p>— 唐蘭</p>
<p>燉煌所出守溫韵學殘卷題「南梁漢比丘守溫述」，因為守溫事　無可考，所以這一條在硏究守溫時，是很重要的材料。</p>
<p>這一條裏的「漢比丘」三字，羅莘田先生作殘卷跋說是「所以別於天竺沙門」，（史語所集刋三本二分）大致是可信的。關於「南梁」，羅先生說「非表朝代，即示郡邑」，又說「唐代以後惟朱溫國號曰梁，而其始都開封，繼遷洛陽，均不得冠以南名，則南梁必非朝代明矣」。除了朝代，只好說是「郡邑」，可是在唐代只有武德四年時有南梁州，是從潭州分出來的，在今湖南寳　，但在貞觀時已改做邵州，天寳時又改做邵陵郡，這雲花一現的州名，不見得在唐末還有人用。因此，羅先生又疑惑這是史記田完世家的「南梁」，史記索隱引晋太康地記說：</p>
<p>戰國謂梁為南梁者，別</p>
<p>之於大梁少梁也。以為　俗相沿，唐人旣常把汴州叫做「大梁」，也許就把臨汝西的故梁縣叫做「南梁」。</p>
<p>但是明釋眞空篇韻貫珠集總述來源請說。</p>
<p>法言造韻野王篇，字母溫公舍利傳，等子觀音斯置造，五音呼噏是軒轅。</p>
<p>大唐舍利置斯綱，外有根源定不妨，後有梁山溫首座，添成六母合宮商。又叫做「梁山溫首座」，羅先生在注裏提到，說：</p>
<p>其所謂梁山，究指守溫住錫之山？抑指唐山南道萬州屬縣？或即由「南梁」展轉傳訛？一時疑莫能決，容俟續考。</p>
<p>這一段疑案在我心目中往來有八九年了。最初提起我注意的是趙蔭宲先生，他疑心「梁山」是山名，是湖南的一座山，而不是一個縣、記得他曾找到一本梁山許多和尙的譜錄，可惜都是宋元以後的，依然找不出什麼綫索</p>
<p>最近有人吿訴我，周一良先生曾經說過梁山在四川，那恐怕就指唐時屬山南東道萬州的梁山縣。</p>
<p>其實，守溫所寫的「南梁」，應該是現在陜西的南鄭縣。太平廣記卷一百九十溫造條說：</p>
<p>憲宗之代，戎羯亂華，</p>
<p>四方微師，以靜邊患。詔下「南梁」，起甲十五千八，令赴關下。將起帥人作叛，逐其帥，又懼朝廷討伐，因團集拒命者歲餘。　宗深以為患，擇帥者久之。京兆尹溫造請行，簽宗問其兵儲所費，溫曰：「不請寸兵尺刃而行」。至其界，『梁』人覘其所求，止一儒生，皆相賀曰：『朝廷必不問其罪，復何患乎。』溫但宣詔敕安存，至則一無所問。然「梁」帥負過出入者皆不捨器仗，溫亦不誠之。他日，毬場中設樂，三軍下士，並任執帶弓劍赴之，遂令於長廊之下就食坐筵之前，臨堦南北兩行，長索二條，令軍人各於而前索上掛其弓箭而食。逡巡，行酒至，鼓噪一聲，兩頭齊抨其索，則劍去地三丈餘矣。軍人大亂，無以施其勇，然後闔戶而斬之，五千餘人，更無噍類。其間有百姓隨親情及替人有赴設來者甚多，並玉石一既矣。「南」人自爾累世不敢復叛。余二十年前職於斯，故老尙歷壓而記之矣。——出王氏見聞這一節故事是唐史上記載過的，舊唐書溫造傳說：</p>
<p>（太和）四年，興元軍亂，殺節度使李綘。文宗以造氣蒙嫉惡，乃授檢校右散騎常侍，興元尹，山南西道節度使。造辭赴鎭，以興元兆亂之狀奏之，文宗盡悟其根本，許以便宜用事。帝慮用兵勞費，造奏曰：「臣計諸道征蠻之兵已廻，俟臣行程至褒縣，望賜臣密詔，使受約束，比臣及興元諸軍相續而至，用此足矣。「乃授造手詔四通，神策行營將董重質，河中都將溫德　，郃陽都將劉士和等咸令禀造之命。造行至褒城，會興元都將衛志忠征蠻廻，謁見，造即留以自衛，密與志忠謀，又召亞將張丕李少直各驗其旨。曁發　城，以八百人為衙隊，五百人為前軍。前軍入府，分守諸門。造下車置　，所司供帳於　事，造曰：「此隘狹，不足以士卒，移之牙門』。坐定，將卒羅幷，志忠兵周環之。造曰：『吾欲問新軍去住之意，可悉前，舊軍無得錯雄。』勞問旣　，傳言令坐。有未至者，因令舁酒巡行，及酒匝，未至者皆至，牙兵圍之亦合，坐卒未悟。增上有先覺者，揮令起，造傳言叱之，因帖息不敢動。即召坐卒，詰以殺綘之狀。志忠張丕夾階立，拔劍呼曰：「殺」，圍兵齊奮，其賊首敎練使丘籌等幷官健千人，皆斬首於地，血流四注。和廣記所載有兩點很大的不同，第一，廣記在　宗時，而此在文宗太和四年。第二，廣記在「南梁』，也呌做『梁』，而此在「興元』。</p>
<p>廣記此條注「出王氏見聞」，這書已佚，廣記所引凡二十九條，也稱為王氏見聞錄，大部分都是五代時前蜀的故事，又常提到王仁裕所經歷的事情，應該就是宋史藝文志的王仁裕見聞錄三卷。據五代史卷五十七王仁裕傳說：</p>
<p>唐莊宗平蜀，仁裕事害</p>
<p>復為秦州節度判官。王思同鎭興元，辟為從事。後來王思同給廢帝打敗，王氏見聞也有王思同一條見廣記卷四百五十九。考五代史王思同傳說：</p>
<p>石敬塘討董璋，思同為先鋒指揮使，兵入劍門，而後軍不繼，思同與璋戰不勝而却。敬塘兵罷，思同徙鎭山南西道。已而復為京兆尹西京留守。可見王思同鎭興元，辟王仁裕為從事，應該在後唐明宗長興一二年以後，憨帝應順元年以前。（九三一——九三四）</p>
<p>溫造殺興元叛卒的事情，遠在唐文宗太和四年（八三〇），太平廣記卷三百十王錡條引河東記和害書正合，到王仁裕做從事時已隔一百多年，聽故老的傳說，年代是狠容易錯誤的。何况王氏自己說「余二十年前職於斯」可見他寫　一段故事的時候，已經是後　時代，（九五一年以後）據本傳，他死於周顯德三年，七十七歲，寫書時大概已七十多了，這種雜錄的書，全憑記憶，不檢書籍，就難免把文宗錯成憲宗了。</p>
<p>但是，地名是不會鍇的。這一件故事發生在興元，王仁裕在五十多歲時當過山南西道節度使的從事，就在興元，所以說「余二十年前職於斯」，他就在當地聽　這故事，所以決不能記錯了地方。現在他把與元為做「南梁』，或是「梁」都兩見，唯一可能的解釋，是興元又叫做「南梁」或「梁」。</p>
<p>興元從　國魏末時起，就稱梁州，唐武德元年立梁州，開元十三年改褒州，才七年又改梁州，一直到西元七八四年　宗西幸，才改做典元府。到王仁裕做從事時，還不到一百五十年，民間還保存「梁」的舊名，是無問題的。這地方原屬前蜀，蜀亡入後唐，所以王思同可以做節度使，到王思同復為京兆尹西京留守時，繼他做　度使的是張虔釗，應順元年，王思同　廢帝打仗，敗後，張虔釗就歸附了孟知祥，所以在王仁裕寫這故事時，興元實際上是孟蜀的地方了，</p>
<p>王仁裕是秦　的土著，前蜀的舊臣，又在興元住過，地方情形是狠熟悉的。在隨手記錄這故事時，不說興元，也不說南鄭，而寫「梁」或「南梁」，可見這一定是那時狠通用的別名。但是為什麼在「梁」字上又加上一個「南」字呢？據我的推想，興元是山南；山北的韓城，是古代的梁國，相傳就是禹貢「治」梁及歧」的「梁」，而興元又叫做梁州，却相傳就是禹貢「華陽黑水惟梁州」的「梁」，如果把山北的韓城認為是「梁」，那山南的興元當然就是「南梁」了。再從近一些看，乾縣附近，即唐時的奉天縣，也是梁山，唐德宗在奉天時，高重捷和朱泚的將李日月在這裏打過仗。和興元正是一南一北。</p>
<p>至於眞空把守溫呌做『梁山溫首座』，這却是容易解釋的。南鄭東南有梁州山，也呌做梁山，太平寰宇記引爾雅「南方之美者，有梁山之犀象焉」，說州因山名，這似乎也可以稱為「南梁」。還有一個中梁山在西，五代時有興元府中梁山遵古　師，見景德傳燈錄卷十五。</p>
<p>梁州山很大，中間有三十多里的平曠地，據說就是從前的縣治，守溫大槪就住錫在那裏。可惜那時人只重談備，地的事蹟竟致一無可考</p>
<p>我們推測他是唐末或五代的人，現在，「南梁』這僩地名，恰好見於五代時人的紀錄上，這僅有的材料是很可寳貴的。王仁裕（八八〇—九五六）在五代時，以文學奢名，所著還有玉堂閒話，也巳佚，在太平廣記裏引用很多。這本王氏見聞錄，本是雜記，很多和史實有關，不是憑空結撰的小說，埋沒在太平廣記的神怪妖鬼　面是很可惜的。</p>

<h3>On the Student Anti-American and Pro-Japanese Movement; US Ambassador Issues Statement; Ministry of Foreign Affairs to Reiterate Our Position on Japan Today</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Our Newspaper in Nanjing, 4th] US Ambassador Stuart made a statement at 11:00 am on the 4th at the US Embassy, ​​advising students engaged in the anti-American and pro-Japanese movement. The ambassador's statement was approved by the US State Department. The official reaction in the capital is generally good. A spokesperson for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced that a statement will be issued on the 5th to reiterate China's position on the Japanese issue and oppose the US's views on Japanese policy in order to clarify the communist bandits' conspiracy and instigating propaganda, so that pure students and people from all walks of life can understand the truth of the facts and avoid this matter from continuing to be used by the communist bandits as a tool to alienate Sino-US friendship.</p>
<p>Opinions of Government Officials</p>
<p>In addition, reporters visited important government officials and asked for their opinions. Premier Weng Wenhao of the Executive Yuan said that he hoped that the students would be enlightened by Ambassador Stuart's advice. Today is an era of fighting to the death against the communists, and they must not be instigated and used by ambitious people. China has an unswerving independent position on the Japanese issue and will never follow the United States. Young students and people from all walks of life should avoid being confused by anti-American propaganda. Political Committee Member Dong Xiankuang said that the Chinese government will resolutely stop any unscrupulous activities that engage in anti-Americanism under the pretext of the Japanese issue. Minister of Education Zhu Jiahua said that he only returned to work at the ministry on the 4th after dispelling his intention to resign, and he still needs to understand the students' activities. However, the Ministry of Education has paid attention to it. The target of Ambassador Stuart's statement is mainly student groups, so there is no reaction from people in the business community in Nanjing. However, a senior diplomat to Japan told reporters that anti-Americanism and pro-Japaneseism are two different things. Under the current world situation, it is unwise to conduct anti-Americanism for any unwarranted reason, which violates the general trend of the world and the interests of the country and is not worth emulating. However, the act of supporting Japan is difficult for both the Chinese government and the people to agree with. Judging from Japan's recent behavior, if Japan is slightly indulged, it is very easy to embark on the road of economic aggression again. Fortunately, the so-called Strike Plan and Draper Plan are just reports from a few officials and have not been adopted by the US government as a principle to change its policy towards Japan. Otherwise, if Japan's cunning plan succeeds, it is not what China wants, nor is it a blessing for the world. Therefore, in terms of the policy towards Japan, our country must adhere to its position, and the diplomatic authorities should make a statement to inform the people and the world.</p>
<p>Our Policy Towards Japan Remains Unchanged</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Our Newspaper in Nanjing, 4th] Regarding the US's support for Japan, voices of opposition are frequently heard from all sides. A certain authoritative person in the diplomatic circle recently talked to reporters about our country's policy towards Japan from a diplomatic point of view, saying that our policy towards Japan has long been determined. No matter how the policies of other countries are, we will maintain the following two principles: (1) In the peace conference with Japan, we must reserve the right to veto; (2) Our policy towards the treatment of Japan has always been generous, but the meaning of generosity is not to allow Japan to rebuild its military power and restore its aggressive power, but to enable Japan to maintain peace and democracy, and within the scope of peace and democracy, enable the Japanese people to obtain a living standard that meets the standards.</p>
<p>Contents of the Ambassador's Statement</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Our Newspaper in Nanjing, 4th] US Ambassador to China Stuart published a statement at a press conference at the US Embassy on the morning of the 4th (excerpt): I am now forced to publicly acknowledge with a sincere and heavy heart a growing dangerous situation. This situation not only affects the interests of the United States, but also affects the vital interests of China. What I am referring to is the movement against the US policy towards Japan.</p>
<p>I do not pretend to know who initiated this movement and what its purpose is. What I know for sure is that this action has seriously damaged the harmonious friendship between China and the United States. If it continues, it may lead to unfortunate consequences. What is even more regrettable is that this kind of action is happening at a time when the United States is embarking on a broad and solemn plan to assist China, which is in a tragic situation.</p>
<p>I do not want to believe that the universities that initiated and echoed the anti-American movement believe the reasons they use to oppose our country. Our country is accused of supporting Japan and restoring its warlords and economic imperialism. This accusation is obviously wrong. After the victorious end of the war against Japan, the United States immediately represented the Allied countries that destroyed Japan's military power and began to dismantle the organizations of the Japanese army, navy, air force and staff. I don't think anyone can present any evidence that any part of Japan's military power is currently being restored. Nor can anyone present any evidence that the United States has any intention other than to ensure that Japan's military power will never rise again. The foundation of Japanese aggression lies in its imperial territories outside its homeland. Now that Japan has lost its imperial territories, it cannot re-establish them without military power. The American people and government will never allow it to do so. You can rest assured.</p>
<p>As for Japan's economic and industrial capabilities. The United States has also, on behalf of the Allied countries, begun to destroy or dismantle its wartime industries. We are now encountering a situation where we must restore Japan's economy to the extent that the Japanese can be self-sufficient. No one can expect American taxpayers to continue to pay for the Japanese indefinitely. Japan must be given the opportunity to be self-sufficient, otherwise Japan will be a continuing burden not only to the United States but also to China. A country that cannot survive on its own is a threat to maintaining security and peace. A nation that cannot survive on its own will never become a peace-loving and democratic nation.</p>
<p>If the Japanese are made into a hungry and restless people, then Japan will continue to be a threat to peace. This situation is just what communism needs. If we are sincere in the interests of the general public, we must stop communism, then we must eliminate the factors that encourage communism. You and the American people have the same concern about Japan. We do not want a communist Japan, and the best way to prevent this disaster is to enable the Japanese to make a living on their own.</p>
<p>Ambassador Answers Reporters' Questions</p>
<p>After the ambassador announced his prepared statement, he also answered questions from reporters. The main questions and answers of the reporters are as follows:</p>
<p>Q: Regarding the four questions raised in yesterday's Central Daily News editorial "On the Anti-American Movement", can the ambassador express his opinion?</p>
<p>A: No comment.</p>
<p>Q: In the ambassador's observation, does the Chinese government have any actions to instigate this anti-American movement?</p>
<p>A: The Chinese government has never instigated this movement.</p>
<p>Q: Does your government intend to lodge a protest with the Chinese government?</p>
<p>A: The US government has no such plans.</p>
<p>Q: The ambassador mentioned in his speech that if the student anti-American movement continues, it will cause some unfortunate consequences. Can you explain what "unfortunate consequences" means?</p>
<p>A: (Answered by the spokesperson of the US Embassy) Currently, the American people are paying extra taxes with great enthusiasm to strengthen aid to China. If the student "anti-American movement" continues, this enthusiastic emotion may change.</p>

<p>Editorial: Distinguishing Between Pro-Japanese Anti-Americanism and the Anti-American Movement – After Reading Ambassador Stuart's Statement</p>
<p>Recently, the United States has become increasingly blatant in its statements about supporting Japan, which has aroused suspicion and criticism from some Chinese intellectuals regarding American policy toward Japan. Unexpectedly, the argument of "opposing American support for Japan" has been used by a small number of students in various universities in our country. Using this as a slogan, they have incited student unrest throughout the country, creating the current "anti-American movement," which is raging like wildfire and spreading everywhere, with a growing danger. If measures are not taken to control it as soon as possible, it may cause unfortunate consequences. Ambassador Stuart specially received Chinese and foreign journalists in Nanjing yesterday morning and issued a written statement. We have repeatedly read the original text and summarized its main points as follows:</p>
<p>(1) The dangerous situation caused by the anti-American movement not only affects American interests, but also affects China's important interests; (2) Although he does not want to know who is inciting the "anti-American movement" and what its purpose is, he firmly believes that this movement has seriously damaged the traditional friendship between China and the United States. Allowing it to continue will inevitably lead to very unfortunate consequences; (3) The accusations by college students that the United States is supporting Japan's restoration of military, economic, and imperialist power are all fabrications, and no one can provide concrete evidence; (4) If it is said that the recovery of the Japanese economy is enough to pose a threat to China's peace, it is also a wrong argument. If the Japanese people also become hungry and insecure, Japan will continue to be a threat to peace, which is exactly what communism is seeking. For the benefit of the general public, it is necessary to stop communism, and we must also eliminate the factors that encourage communism; (5) He urges Chinese students to be loyal to themselves and love their country. China needs the students' faithful efforts; (6) Finally, he declares that the ambassador's greatest wish is for peace and happiness for all mankind. If China and the United States cannot treat each other with sincerity, be friendly to each other, and trust each other, it will inevitably endanger the peace and happiness of mankind.</p>
<p>Ambassador Stuart's written statement is full of enthusiasm and is really too persuasive. It is not only earnest and sincere, but also completely from the heart. All good Chinese people who read the original text of his statement cannot help but be moved to tears. However, for the sake of clarifying the current situation and clarifying the understanding of the Chinese and American people, we must reiterate the facts in order to correct the vision of the Chinese and American people.</p>
<p>First, when commenting on the anti-American movement today, it is necessary to distinguish between two temporarily different facts. One is the anti-American movement incited by a small number of students, and the other is the suspicion and criticism of American policy toward Japan by some people in society. These two facts, which are completely different in nature, must not be confused. The former is a movement launched by a small number of students under the guise of "opposing American support for Japan." They are not for the benefit of China, but for the conspiracy of the Communist International. The CCP launched the anti-American movement as early as two years ago. Recently, because of the deterioration of US-Soviet relations and the United States' active military and economic assistance to the Chinese National Government, the CCP's anti-American movement has intensified. Now, these few professional students are willing to be military spies for the Communist bandits. When they encounter such a good opportunity, they will naturally use the general public's suspicion of American policy toward Japan to carry out their tricks of inciting the anti-American movement. Their purpose is obvious. On the one hand, they attempt to shift the attention of the Chinese people to the future prospects of the Japanese invasion train restarting, while ignoring the fact that our country's sovereignty over the Northeast territory is being harmed. On the other hand, they want to alienate the close friendship between China and the United States, and attempt to undermine the implementation of the US aid plan to China. Therefore, the echo in Stuart's statement, such as "China's important interests are also affected," "If [the movement] continues, it will inevitably lead to unfortunate consequences," etc., will not only not make these few professional students afraid, but will encourage their rebellious activities, because their purpose is not for the benefit of China at all. They want China's important surplus to be harmed, and they want to cause unfortunate consequences. The news that the House Appropriations Committee cut $63.3 million in funds is considered by these anti-American students to be a great success for their anti-sigh movement? Ambassador Stuart has a deep understanding of Chinese politics and understands the psychology of the people; but he may not be able to clearly recognize the role of this type of action. Therefore, we must especially point this out, and hope that the Ambassador and the people of the country can distinguish between pro-Japanese anti-Americanism and the anti-American movement, and must not confuse them.</p>
<p>Second, the recent American policy toward Japan, especially Stettinius's anti-reparations theory and Clayton's non-reparations theory, greatly relax the requirements for Japan's industrial level and the issue of Japan's indemnity. The consequences of this are not only that China suffers significant material losses, but also that the Chinese people see the enemy's resurgence and feel threatened in their spirit. The suspicions of the Chinese people are a natural phenomenon and cannot be eliminated; however, the activities of the general public are limited to raising opinions and have no anti-American implications. Moreover, after hearing Ambassador Stuart's statement, clarifying that the United States' policy toward Japan has no intention of supporting Japan's restoration of military, economic, and imperialist power, all doubts and fears can naturally be dispelled. However, the general public also expresses admiration for MacArthur's control of Japan and its existing achievements; but they always feel that "a gentleman can be deceived by his methods" and that MacArthur is in danger of being deceived by the Japanese. China has no intention of retaliation against Japan, but seeks a solid guarantee of peace in the Far East. This is the same as the United States' wishes for Japan, so we still hope that the United States can take into account the interests of China and pay attention to the psychology of the Chinese people, and increase vigilance against Japan to prevent the resurgence of Japanese aggression.</p>
<p>Third, the anti-American movement incited by a small number of students in universities across the country this time can give the American government and the public a valuable lesson, that is, the interests of the Chinese Communists and the United States in the Far East cannot coexist. Although the Communists have not yet seized political power in China, their ambition to exclude American interests in the Far East is obvious. If the Chinese government is once seized by the Communists, it is not difficult for us to imagine that the United States will inevitably be excluded from the gate of the Far East, and it will not allow it to say a word about peace and stability in the Far East. This fact is so obvious that if the United States wants to fulfill its responsibility for peace in the Far East, then intensifying aid to China to complete the task of suppressing the rebellion and building the country is the only way out for the United States in the Far East. Therefore, we hope that Ambassador Stuart can have great foresight. The more fiercely the Communist bandits use professional students to oppose the United States, the more actively the US aid plan to China must be carried out. We must not relax our aid to China because of the anti-Americanism incited by a small number of professional students. The CCP's poison scheme to marry the Chinese government.</p>
<p>Finally, we still have to say a few words to our compatriots. Many difficult problems in China at present are not easy to solve for a while, which is enough to cause current worries; but the real crisis in our country's situation lies in the fact that the people of the country do not have a fair and sound public opinion on any issue. Taking this anti-American and pro-Japanese issue as an example, because there is no fair and sound public opinion, it not only fails to improve the country's vigilance against Japan and use the path of national diplomacy to awaken the United States' awareness of its policy toward Japan; on the contrary, it is used by professional students, which makes the problem itself change in nature and causes unpleasant feelings between Chinese and American people. Chinese intellectuals cannot be the backbone of the country and reverse the tide. They cannot shirk their responsibility for the occurrence and expansion of this anti-American movement. This is something that intellectuals across the country should deeply reflect on.</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper's Report from Wuxing, 3rd] A tragic incident occurred in this county recently in which a boy of only fifteen years old plotted to kill an eight-year-old girl.

<h3>Cutting Foreign Aid Hinders Recovery, U.S. Secretary of State Expresses Opposition, U.S. Violates Promises to Damage its Reputation, House Appropriations Committee's Suggestion Causes Repercussions</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] New York, 4th, Broadcast: Washington News, Secretary of State Marshall stated at a press conference today that after the House Appropriations Committee reduced the amount of economic aid to Europe, the European recovery plan would lose its constructive nature and become a relief plan. The government will do its best to prevent it from being reduced.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 3rd] The House Appropriations Committee recently recommended reducing the amount of the Maer Plan and other foreign aid bills proposed by the U.S. government by 25%. This recommendation also applies to aid to China and the European recovery plan. The committee's recommendation is seen in the appropriations bill passed by the committee, stipulating a total of $5.98071 billion in foreign aid for the fifteen months ending July 31, 1949. The committee reduced the amount of aid to Europe to $4 billion, a decrease of $245 million from the original amount, and reduced the amount of aid to China to $400 million, a decrease of $63 million from the original amount (see the first page for the part on aid to China). Although the reduction is only 7% of the original amount, the bill passed by Congress was originally for twelve months, while the committee's recommendation is for fifteen months, so it is actually a reduction of 25% from the original amount. The committee explained the reasons for reducing the amount and extending the period of use, saying that the original intention of the foreign aid plan did not allow spending more than what should be supplied based on a sensible foundation. If an emergency occurs before July 1, 1949, Congress will take necessary action when it convenes in January next year. Congressional figures believe that the House of Representatives will accept the committee's recommendation and pass the reduced appropriations bill. The Senate Appropriations Committee is still in the process of reviewing the appropriations bill for foreign aid. The government believes that the Senate will be able to restore part of the original appropriations. When explaining the reasons for the reduction, the House Appropriations Committee pointed out that since July 1, 1945, the United States has paid $18.1822 billion in foreign aid, which has weakened U.S. resources and wasted part of it. The committee's report also expressed dissatisfaction with the plan to mechanize foreign rural areas and criticized the reconstruction work in West Germany. The reduction in aid to Greece and Turkey was due to the large amount of aid previously provided to those two countries.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 3rd] After the House Appropriations Committee announced the reduction in the amount of foreign aid, ECA Administrator Hoffman immediately convened reporters to give a speech, pointing out that the reduction in the amount of aid to Europe would affect the recovery opportunities of the sixteen European countries. The total amount of 5.3 billion yuan needed for the European recovery plan cannot be reduced. The current hope is only that the Senate can restore the original amount passed by Congress. Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Vandenberg is therefore discussing this matter with Senate Appropriations Committee Chairman Bridges, hoping that the Senate Appropriations Committee will not make a large reduction. Related parties said that Marshall Hoffman and even Truman will put pressure on Congress within days to reduce the dangerousness of the House Appropriations Committee's move and prevent the possible backlash against European public opinion.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, New York, 4th Dispatch] The "New York Times," which has always had an international perspective, recently criticized the House Appropriations Committee's move to reduce the foreign aid funds already passed by Congress. The newspaper said that this reduction is tantamount to violating the promises made by the United States and the will of Congress. "The New York Times" accused House Appropriations Committee Chairman Taber of bearing the blame, as he is largely responsible for cutting foreign aid funds. The newspaper said that foreign aid is extremely important and cannot be arbitrarily handled by Taber's narrow-minded approach. We expect both the House and Senate and the entire Republican Party to take responsibility for their actions, reject Taber's actions, and respect the promises they have made, so as to preserve the reputation of American foreign policy.</p>
<h3>Soviet "Cold" Suddenly Becomes Silent, Basic Policies Will Change, Generally Believed That the Situation Has a Turning Point</h3>
<p>[United Press, New York, 4th] Howard Newspaper's foreign editor Sims reported: "It is believed that the Kremlin is planning to change its basic policies, allowing for the most significant change since the Soviet Union abandoned reconciliation with Britain and France in 1939 and united with Nazi Germany. News from outside the Iron Curtain all state that the Soviet Union's cold war against the West has suddenly fallen silent. News from Britain and the sixteen Marshall Plan countries reveals that the general situation has greatly changed, the likes of which has only been seen since the victory over Germany? Communist parties in countries west of the Soviet Union have also reduced their activities. It seems that the fifth column of the Soviet Union in Western Europe now has a sweet sense of rationality in mind.</p>
<p>Observers in various places reported that war talk in Western Europe has lessened slightly, but some also say that they still privately believe that this is the calm before the storm. The Kremlin must make a decision and it will probably be revealed soon. The worldwide shock of this resolution can be predetermined. Unless Stalin and his Politburo comrades decide that communism and free enterprise can coexist peacefully in the same world and revise their policy of conquering the world, they must take action as soon as possible, and they must strike hard, otherwise once the world begins to recover, they will be unable to stop it.</p>
<h3>U.S. House of Representatives Passes Navy Appropriation Case</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 3rd] The U.S. House of Representatives recently passed an appropriation bill of $3.6887 billion (which also stipulates the construction of a 65,000-ton super aircraft carrier) needed to maintain the world's most powerful fleet in the next fiscal year. The bill has been sent to the Senate. The appropriation passed today brings the defense spending for the next fiscal year to nearly $14.5 billion. The House of Representatives also passed an appropriation of nearly $500 million for the Army and Navy to engage in civil construction projects, and another $1.25 billion for the use of various occupation governments and relief work.</p>

<h3>Soviet Union Favors Finland, Cancels Part of Compensation</h3>
<p>And Loans $5 Million</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] London, 4th, Broadcast: Helsinki News, After the Soviet Union halved the remaining portion of the compensation that Finland should pay, it has now loaned an amount equivalent to US$5 million.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Helsinki, 3rd] The Finnish Foreign Ministry announced today that the Soviet government has decided to cancel part of the compensation that Finland should pay to the Soviet Union under the armistice agreement and the peace treaty that has not yet been paid. The value of the canceled part is approximately 70 million yuan. According to the original agreement, Finland should pay compensation in kind equivalent to 300 million yuan at 1938 prices to the Soviet Union within eight years starting from 1944, which is a major burden on the Finnish economy. The Soviet Union's move is welcomed by the general Finnish people, but others say that the Soviet Union's move is intended to support the Finnish Communist Party to participate in the general election on July 1st. The Finnish Communist Party was defeated in the city council elections last November, and it is unlikely to gain the upper hand in this general election. Kim Koo and Kim Kyu-sik Agree</p>

<h3>The U.S. Army Announces That the Aid Plan to Japan Will Not Be Changed</h3>
<p>The Deficit in the Congressional Cut Will Be Made Up</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Washington, 3rd] The Army today announced that the United States' relief and reconstruction plan in Japan for the next year, despite the Congressional Construction Party's reduction in funding, will still proceed according to the established outline. If Congress supports the fee reduction proposal, it will seek other ways to make up the deficit before the end of the year. The Army will ask Congress to allocate $550 million for one year starting in July.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Tokyo, 4th] Vice Director of the Japanese Economic Stabilization Board 　Yue told the House Foreign Affairs Committee that the Japanese government expects the United States to invest in 230 Japanese trading companies, and the long-term investment plan is nearing completion. However, he also said: Due to the significant damage to U.S. investment in Japan before the war, foreign investors are still hesitant, and it is unlikely that there will be a large amount of investment in a short period of time. Moreover, according to international law, contracts signed with Japan under Allied occupation are likely to be cancelled along with the peace treaty, which is also a reason for hesitation in making large investments.</p>
<h3>Soviet Union Demands the Banning of Anti-Soviet Propaganda in Japan</h3>
<p>Letter to Hull to Prohibit U.S. and Japanese Newspapers from Slandering</p>
<p>[Reuters, Tokyo, 4th] The Soviet representative to the Allied Control Council for Japan wrote to MacArthur this week, demanding that immediate measures be taken to ban U.S. and Japanese newspapers in Japan from engaging in absolutely undisguised anti-Soviet propaganda and slanderous reports about the Soviet Union. He pointed out that the May 17th issue of Newsweek, with the title "White Star vs. Red Star," discussed in detail the strategies that the United States would take in a future Soviet war, even to the point of frankly stating that the United States would bomb major Soviet cities such as Moscow and Leningrad. At the same time, it shamelessly stated that Japan, Britain, Iceland, and North Africa would be the main bases for the United States' war against the Soviet Union. He also said: Such propaganda would never be published without the tacit approval of the Allied Headquarters.</p>

He also said: The ceasefire, which will begin at 9:00 AM Palestine time on Sunday, June 6th, and a four-week truce beginning at 6:00 PM on Monday, June 7th, was decided after serious discussions with both the Arab and Jewish sides in Cairo, Amman, and Haifa.

<h3>Britain Complies with Security Council Resolution to Ban Arms to the Middle East, Arabs and Jews Greatly Debate Ceasefire Terms</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 3rd] On the 2nd, Britain announced an absolute arms embargo on the Middle East, based on the Holy Land ceasefire resolution passed by the Security Council on May 20th. The arms embargo order issued by the British Ministry of Commerce includes war supplies provided by Britain to Middle Eastern Arab countries under treaties, including industrial explosives that can be used for military purposes.</p>
<p>In early February of this year, Britain had already issued an absolute arms embargo to any party within Palestine, but this embargo did not apply to Arab countries that had signed war supply treaties with Britain. The British government's decision this time is based on the provisions of item 3 of the Security Council's May 30th resolution, which states: During the four-week ceasefire, the governments and authorities concerned shall not export or import war materials to Palestine or Arab countries. The items banned by the Ministry of Commerce include aircraft, aircraft engines and parts, bayonets, bombs, and bombing equipment, cannons, firearms, machine guns, and magazines, explosives, detonating cords, hand grenades, land mines, sea mines, flamethrowers, torpedoes, and certain military gases. The diplomatic reporter of this agency said: This ban by the British Ministry of Commerce is the second measure taken by the British government in accordance with the Security Council's resolution. The first measure was the announcement yesterday of the ban on Jewish young adults of military age from traveling to Palestine from British territory during the ceasefire period. Diplomatic circles here also said: Before the Security Council's ceasefire order began to be implemented, Britain expressed its belief that UN Mediator Bernadotte would be able to complete his mission.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Success Lake, 3rd] The UN Security Council met today to "discuss the implementation of a ceasefire in Palestine. Arab and Jewish representatives debated endlessly over the terms of the four-week ceasefire. French representative Barody rebuked such debate as untimely, and urged them to stop such arguments. Chairman, Syrian representative Curry expressed his agreement, and therefore ruled that the decision be made by UN organization mediator Bernadotte, with no one in the audience opposing. The meeting adjourned after thirty-seven minutes. If necessary, it may reconvene on Monday.</p>
<h3>Paraguayan Revolution, President Overthrown by Army</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Paraguayan Capital, 3rd] President Morinigo was overthrown by the army today, and Congress immediately approved his resignation and asked Chief Justice Frutos of the Supreme Court to take office as interim president. Morinigo is 47 years old and has been in office for eight years. His term was originally due to expire on August 15, when the elected President Gonzalez would succeed him. Although Gonzalez is Morinigo's puppet, it is feared that Morinigo will be reluctant to hand over power easily when the time comes, so both sides are plotting to strengthen their forces for the purpose of vying for power. Major military and police forces are now patrolling the streets of the capital, and all telephone lines have been cut. According to the army, Morinigo intended to dismiss the chief of the capital's police department, which contradicts the civil servant protection law passed by the House of Representatives a few hours earlier.</p>
<p>[French News Agency, Argentine Capital, 4th] According to a broadcast from the Paraguayan capital's radio station today, former Paraguayan President Morinigo has been arrested and imprisoned in the barracks of the First Cavalry Division.</p>

<p>[Report from this newspaper] New York Radio Broadcast, 4th: Chicago Dispatch, President Truman delivered a speech here today, urging the American people to assist international refugees and calling on Congress to swiftly pass legislation enabling these people to find work in the United States and lead reasonable and healthy lives.</p>
<p>The President believes that charitable relief alone is insufficient to solve the problem and that active assistance is necessary to achieve success. Therefore, the American people must help them become self-sufficient and combine their efforts. Addressing the issue of communism, the President believes that merely passing laws to prevent its activities would, at best, only drive it underground and would not fundamentally solve the problem. If we fail to address the lives of ordinary people, it will inevitably lead to the rise of communism. The President stated that communism is a product of weakness, distress, and despair and cannot exist in a healthy society. The most effective way to resist communism is to continuously improve our democratic politics, such as improving public health, education, fair wage systems, and preventing inflation. The President concluded by expressing his confidence that America will achieve these goals.</p>
<h3>I Firmly Oppose Restoring Japanese Militarism at ECAFE Meeting; India Proposes Inviting Soviet Union to Develop Eastern Economy</h3>
<p>[Reuters Madras, Ootacamund, 3rd] Chinese representative Li Zhuomin stated today at the United Nations Economic Commission for Asia and the Far East (ECAFE) that while China supports restoring Japan's economic level to the extent that it contributes to economic stability within the ECAFE region, China firmly opposes restoring Japan's economic level to the extent that it could enable Japan to become a war machine.</p>
<p>At today's meeting, representatives discussed the report of the ECAFE's Industrial Development Working Committee for four hours. Representatives requested that Western countries supply industrial equipment to Asian and Far Eastern countries.</p>
<p>[United Press India, Madras State, Ootacamund, 3rd] Indian representative Mukarji proposed today at the United Nations Economic Commission for Asia and the Far East inviting the Soviet Union to develop the Eastern economy. It is said that the United States is pouring all its surplus resources into Western European countries, spending very little on the East. Industrially advanced countries prioritize politics over economics, and trade has become a political appendage. It should be known that Asia has leverage in terms of raw materials. Western investment and technological assistance to Asia should be freely available. No government's export policy should be bound by foreign policy. The British representative immediately guaranteed to provide all assistance to the Far East to promote industry, agreeing to focus on small-scale industries. The Pakistani representative also welcomed foreign assistance from any source. The Chinese representative firmly opposed any proposal to allow Japan to restore certain specialized industries to prevent it from becoming militaristic again. A Soviet request for the committee to conduct private consultations beyond what had been authorized by the United Nations Economic and Social Council was rejected.</p>

<h3>Director of the Public Utilities Bureau Reports: Gas Supply Improvement Plan – Give Priority to Expanding the Wusong Plant – Establish Another High-Pressure Pipeline</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] Zhao Zengjue (趙曾珏), Director of the Municipal Public Utilities Bureau, reported on the city's gas supply situation and preliminary improvement strategies at yesterday's municipal meeting, stating in brief: The number of gas users has increased sharply recently. Before the war, there were only a few thousand households, but now there are more than 20,000 households, and applicants are arriving one after another. In order to meet future needs, a gas technology conference has been established to draft a ten-year gas plan for the city, planning to build another Nanshi (南市) gas plant along the Huangpu River, with an estimated daily production capacity of 5 million cubic feet, which will be the hub of the city's gas supply. However, due to the large amount of funds required, it is difficult to proceed in the short term. Therefore, a temporary plan is proposed to give priority to expanding the Wusong (吳淞) gas plant. Over the past two years, the plant's daily output has increased from 100,000 cubic feet to 800,000 cubic feet. However, the Public Utilities Bureau believes that the existing gas storage and transportation equipment capacity of the Wusong gas plant is too small to meet the needs after increased production. Therefore, it has been decided to lay another 8-inch high-pressure pipeline from the plant's Ouyang Road (歐陽路) pressure regulating room to connect with the high-pressure pipeline of the Shanghai Gas Company, and to add a pressure regulating station in front of Tongji University (同濟大學) on North Sichuan Road (北四川路) to reduce the pressure, from which it will be transported in five low-pressure lines. This plan has been approved by the Mayor. The mechanical gasifier is expected to arrive around mid-October of this year and can be installed by the end of the year, which will increase the gas supply. Before the Nanshi gas plant is established, the Public Utilities Bureau has decided to lay a new pipeline from the corner of Guangdong Road (廣東路) by the Wusong gas plant to the Min Guo (民國路) Road in the Nanshi area to benefit the citizens of Nanshi.</p>

(B) When the above workers are dismissed, they shall be handled in accordance with the instructions of the Ministry of Social Affairs, Jing Lao Zi No. 31037 of May 8, 1947 (or negotiated by themselves; if the negotiation fails, they shall be allowed to refer to the method for dismissing workers with indefinite contracts in factories resolved at the second meeting of the association), but if there is an agreement in various industries, the agreement shall still prevail (according to the above two methods passed, because they are supplemental regulations to the Factory Law, they must be submitted to the Ministry of Social Affairs for implementation).</p>
<p>Wage Assessment for Iron Printing and Can Making</p>
<p>(2) Regarding the dispute over the index discount between labor and management in the iron printing and can making industry, it was assessed that the period from May 16 to September 15, a period of four months, should be used as the basis. In addition to the discounts stipulated by the government, the workers' basic salary should be calculated and paid at 90% of the index. As for the employer's request to reduce workers or rotate shifts, it should be discussed and resolved. (3) Regarding the dispute over the shutdown allowance at the Donggou (東溝) chip factory of the Da Zhonghua (大中華) Match Company, it was assessed that it should still be handled in accordance with the provisions of the mediation record No. 578 of the Social Affairs Bureau.</p>

<h3>After the Prohibition of Using Bills as Collateral – The Monetary Control Bureau Spot Checks Returned Bills – And Strictly Inspects the Bank Drafts of Various Banks</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] Since the implementation of the measures to prohibit the use of bills as collateral on June 1, the market response has been good, and the financial market has also remained stable. The amount of returned bills on the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd showed a decreasing trend. The amount of returned bills on the 3rd was reduced to 178 billion. A person in charge of the Monetary Control Bureau said: The average daily amount of returned bills this month will not exceed 100 billion. From the 4th, the Monetary Control Bureau will spot check returned bills to minimize them, and strictly inspect the bank drafts of various banks. The issuance of bank drafts must be based on customer requests or contractual relationships. If it is found that banks are issuing blank bank drafts, the manager and the person signing the bank draft will be immediately transferred to the court for strict handling, and all banks have been notified to pay close attention. It is also said that the increase in the circulation of bank drafts is irrelevant, because the issuance of bank drafts has a certain procedure, and absolutely no returned bills are allowed. As long as the amount of exchange decreases, it can indicate that the credit circulation rate has been greatly reduced, which has a significant effect on stabilizing prices.</p>

The initial price of 42-count Blue Phoenix fine yarn jumped by 11 million yuan.

<h3>Negotiations to Reduce Tariffs on Bleached Silk for Sale to the US</h3>
<p>[Nanjing, June 4, Report from this newspaper] There is considerable demand for bleached silk produced in China in the US market. However, because the current import tariff rate on bleached silk in the United States is higher than that on dyed and printed silk, it is impossible for bleached silk from China to be sold in the US. The reason is that preferential terms for bleached silk have not been included in all US foreign tariff agreements, so the tariff rate is 30-40% higher than that of dyed and printed silk. The Import and Export Control Committee has suggested to the Ministry of Economic Affairs that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs should formally negotiate with the US government to reduce the tariff rate on this semi-finished product in order to maintain China's silk industry and facilitate the earning of foreign exchange. The Ministry of Economic Affairs has now requested the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and other relevant agencies to conduct negotiations.</p>

Kerosene rose to 2.8 million per bottle.</p>
<h3>Sales in All Areas Are Stagnant – Rice Prices Initially Rise and Then Level Off – Flour Prices Vary, Miscellaneous Grains and Cooking Oil Are Slightly Stronger</h3>
<p>The rice market showed a slight recovery, mainly because tin prices stabilized, arrivals were not active, samples were not numerous, and owners quoted higher prices. The market opened very strong in the morning, rising by about 100,000 yuan. However, rice shops did not accept well, sales were stagnant, and the price lacked the power to rise, so the market turned flat in the afternoon and finally rose slightly by 50,000 yuan. White japonica rice in the north market was 6.95 million yuan, rising by 50,000 yuan. Extra high japonica rice also rose by another 50,000 yuan, to 7.25 million yuan. Because the price of glutinous rice was high, goods from Zhaoyuan arrived in four batches, and supply exceeded demand, so the price fell by 100,000 yuan. 4,635 dan (石) of goods arrived in the two markets.</p>
<p>Flour prices are stable before the new wheat arrives on the market. Inland prices are average, so the market sentiment is not active, retail investors are indifferent, and sales are more than purchases. Traders in the north are standing aside, transactions are not taking place, and prices are slightly rising and falling. Lao Che flour fell by 10,000 yuan, Bingchuan flour was average, and the China Trust Bureau sold 9,200 bags at the original price. Miscellaneous brand flour mostly fell. Wheat bran was stable, and the factory price of wheat still stood at 2.7 million yuan.</p>
<p>Miscellaneous grains are firm and stable. The price of soybeans is stronger in the afternoon, because customers are absorbing, so the market trend is firm. Hankou Za beans closed at 3.6 million yuan, rising by 100,000 yuan, and Du beans did not increase. Corn continued the previous day's rise, rising again by 100,000. Red sorghum, new yuan wheat, new silkworms, etc. were all firm. Mung beans customers selectively absorbed secondary goods, and the market was average. Sesame seldom showed prosperity, and raw kernels were rarely traded. The retail price in the local market rose.</p>
<p>Cooking oil prices opened high and turned flat at the close, rising slightly. The morning opening price continued the previous day's rise, and owners still insisted on raising prices. Da You soybean oil opened at 16.2 million yuan, and the closing price retreated to 15.8 million yuan, 150,000 yuan higher than the previous day. Raw oil rose by 200,000, but transactions were not numerous. Raw vegetable oil and others all rose by 1-200,000 yuan, but small cart sesame oil fell back by 200,000 yuan in the afternoon. Bean cake factories had no supply, and the market remained firm at a slightly higher price of 1-20,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>Stable Sugar Prices</h3>
<p>After the sugar market rose the day before yesterday, the decline was insignificant. Yesterday, it stabilized. The guild's quoted price for spot 24 coarse white sugar was 9.6 million yuan, up 50,000 yuan. Four-and-a-half white was 10.075 million yuan, up a small 50,000 yuan. There were no fluctuations for No. 20 medium granulated white sugar. Other local sugars, such as Shantou Qingdiao Qing and Xinghua white, remained mostly unchanged. However, Hainan red sugar was in tight supply, with high-quality sugar quoted at 6.05 million yuan, and ordinary sugar at 5.75 million to 5.81 million yuan, with a total of 800 to 900 transactions.</p>
<h3>New Decisions on Payment Methods for Goods: Grain Industry</h3>
<p>Payment on Day of Transaction with Crossed Checks on the Following Day</p>
<p>The joint meeting of directors and supervisors of the three guilds of the local grain, flour, bran, and oil industries, and the three market management committees, was held at 3:00 PM yesterday (the 4th) at the Grain Market at 377 Min Guo Road. More than 50 attendees, including Zhang Chao, Fu Changyu, and Cheng Zhenxiang, were present. Fu Changyu and Zhang Chao co-chaired the meeting. The chairman first reported that since the financial authorities implemented the ban on using same-day bills, although many businesses used promissory notes for settlement, it was often impossible for the buyer to rush to the bank to exchange the crossed check for a promissory note on the same day. This has led to delays in settlement and significantly affected business operations. Therefore, all attending representatives were asked to jointly discuss specific methods for the collection and payment of goods. After the representatives expressed their opinions, it was resolved that for transactions in the grain market, the buyer should deliver the goods purchased by 11:00 AM on the same day, and the seller should pay 80% of the goods with a crossed check the following day. For the flour, bran, and oil markets, the full payment with a crossed check on the following day is required.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Economic Affairs Orders All Agencies to Prevent Textile Factories from Moving to Hong Kong</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 4th] To prevent inland textile factories from moving to Hong Kong without a legitimate reason, the Ministry of Economic Affairs has decided to take preventative measures. It has recently ordered the Shanghai Industrial and Commercial Guidance Office and the Flower Management Committee to pay close attention and stipulated that all equipment and materials of the aforementioned factories cannot be exported without prior approval.</p>
<h3>The Export Control Committee Begins Processing the Fifth Quarter's Milk Quota Allocation</h3>
<p>[Our Report] The Quota Allocation Department of the Export Control Committee has been ordered to expedite the allocation of the fifth quarter's quota for products in Appendix (II). It is expected to be completed within a week. Quota allocation notices will be issued separately to factories, users, and qualified importers, allowing them to apply to the department according to the quotas they receive. For the fifth and sixth quarters of Appendix (II), the Executive Yuan announced in February of this year a total of US$73,476,000, with half allocated for the fifth quarter, totaling US$36,738,000. Due to foreign exchange difficulties after the announcement, allocation has only been possible now.</p>
<h3>Wool Textile Industry Requests Reversal of Decision Regarding Foreign Currency Deposit Certificates</h3>
<p>The Central Bank, Export Control Committee, and China Trust Bureau have agreed on new methods for using special foreign currency deposit certificates purchased with self-provided foreign exchange. The new method still requires the original importer to provide a foreign exchange settlement certificate. After learning about this, the wool textile industry believes that this will increase difficulties for the industry and has expressed its inability to accept the new rules. Yesterday morning (the 4th), representatives Chen Yuanqin, Tang Huaru, Yang Liren, and Ye Yikang were dispatched to the Export Control Committee and the Central Bank to request a reversal of the decision. The industry requested that procedures that have not been completed should be processed according to the new rules. However, for those who have already completed all procedures according to the regulations, they should still be allowed to follow the original rules. The industry pointed out that when the China Trust Bureau purchases their goods, it already adds 150% to the cost, and now the special foreign currency deposit certificates they are entitled to receive require a foreign exchange settlement certificate, which will threaten the survival of the industry. Therefore, they strongly request a reversal of the decision.</p>

<h3>First Day of University Games: University and College Groups - St. John's and National Defense Medical College Lead; Shanghai University and Lixin Accounting School Dominate Women's Groups</h3>
<p>[Our Report] The opening ceremony of the third Municipal Joint University and College Games was held at 1:00 PM yesterday at the Jiangwan City Stadium.

The opening ceremony was presided over by the chairman, President Cheng Xiaogang of Jiaotong University, who delivered the opening address. Mayor Wu's representative, Canjun Wang Guanqing, delivered an instructional speech. The ceremony was simple and solemn, followed immediately by the start of the competition.</p>
<p>The results of the first day of competition showed that St. John's University led in the men's university group with 29 and a half points, followed by Tongji University with 19 points, Shanghai University with 14 points, and Jiaotong University with 12 points. However, with a gap of more than 10 points, St. John's is considered the strongest contender for the championship. In the women's group, Shanghai University led with 9 points, followed by Daxia University with 8 points, and St. John's, Guanghua, and Jinan Universities each with 6 points. The championship will be a fiercely competitive race.

Today, there will be a heated competition with the National Defense Medical College. In the women's group, Lixin Accounting School scored 31 points, making the championship almost certain. The National Defense Medical College only scored 6 points, and Shanghai Law College scored 3 points. Only East Asia University participated in the physical education group, which was not scored and was only for demonstration purposes.</p>
<p>The results of the first day were mediocre, mainly due to the lack of training in each school. However, St. John's University broke the university record of 48.7 seconds in the men's 400-meter relay with a time of 47.5 seconds, which was particularly impressive. The performance of the physical education group was better than average, but the lack of competition made it somewhat unsatisfactory.</p>

<h3>Indonesian Chinese Delegation Departs Shanghai Today and Tomorrow to Return South</h3>
<p>The Indonesian Chinese delegation participating in the 7th National Games departed Shanghai in batches by plane to Hong Kong yesterday and today. Yesterday, more than 40 male and female athletes departed, and today, more than 20 athletes will depart, led by team leader Qiu Zuorong at 6:30 AM. After gathering in Hong Kong, all athletes will board a mail ship on the 9th to return to Java. According to team leader Qiu before his departure, he expressed his deep gratitude for the praise and guidance given by all sectors of the motherland and the sports journalism community during their participation in the National Games. He also apologized for not being able to say goodbye due to the haste of departure.</p>
<h3>Gansu National Games Athlete Yun Ying to be Buried Today</h3>
<p>Yun Ying, an athlete from Gansu Province participating in the National Games, unfortunately passed away in Shanghai last month due to illness. Friends of Yun Ying have scheduled a memorial service before the burial at the Guohua Funeral Home at 1:00 PM this afternoon, and the burial will take place at Anping Cemetery at 3:00 PM this afternoon.</p>
<h3>Snippets from the Venue</h3>
<p>The cheers of the cheerleading squads are the only unique phenomenon of this sports meet compared to the 7th National Games. Shanghai University and St. John's University both have cheerleading squads. The former has a larger number of people and is more outstanding, but the cheerleaders are inevitably less impressive due to the underperformance of the athletes.</p>
<p>Most of the sports uniforms have a white background with red characters. Tongji, Shanghai Law, Normal College, Shanghai University, and Daxia are all examples. St. John's and Dental College have red backgrounds with white characters. Jiaotong has blue uniforms with yellow characters, and Jinan is all black, making them the easiest to identify.</p>
<p>Tongji's Mai Mingda and Pan Zhengming, with numbers 1 and 2, suddenly remembered this during the high jump final and couldn't help but smile at each other. In the end, they won first and second place, which can be said to be a coincidence.</p>
<p>Among the athletes of St. John's, there are two blue-eyed individuals, Bao Lai and Peng Sandi. The former is known for basketball and triathlon, while the latter participated in the 1500-meter race without any outstanding performance.</p>
<p>The track and field referee Liu Hesheng was very critical of athletes who false started and very considerate to those who did not.</p>
<p>The sixteen school flags were lined up horizontally, with five different colors. Among them, the St. John's school flag was the smallest, and the Tongde Medical College flag was the most eye-catching.</p>
<p>The opening ceremony yesterday was very simple. President Cheng's speech was short but meaningful. The athletes stood in the hot sun for only a few minutes, which they were very grateful for. This is a good example of an opening ceremony for a sports meet and is worth promoting.</p>
<p>The command platform lacked microphones, and the announcer shouted through a megaphone, straining his voice. The lack of a commanding soul for the conference was a shortcoming. It is said that it was not due to saving money, but rather a lack of electricity.</p>
<p>Having too many groups has both advantages and disadvantages. The advantage is that everyone can score points and everyone is happy. The disadvantage is that it is distracting and cannot be focused. News reporters were dizzy. On the first day, there were as many as 30 finals, which can be described as a grand spectacle.</p>
<p>A sports meet with the participation of 18 universities is not small in scale, but some facilities are lacking. Even the university presidents, who are the president and vice presidents, did not have chairs to sit on and walked around on the command platform. It is said that this is due to insufficient funding.</p>
<p>The general decline in results does not resemble a joint university sports meet. Lack of training is the biggest reason, and the school authorities and sports directors should be held responsible.</p>
<p>Only East Asia University participated in the physical education group, which seemed like an East Asia Physical Education University sports meet inserted into the main event.</p>
<p>Several athletic ladies wore casual clothes and watched from the sidelines without participating in the performances, which was a pity. According to the coach, it was all due to unavoidable family matters.</p>
<p>In front of the western command platform, there were five large and small tents in total, one for St. John's, two for Guanghua, and two for Tongji. There were also six small tents on the north side, which were the base camp for the East Asia Physical Education University Boy Scouts.</p>

<h3>Ministry of Education Purchases Over 140 Billion in Books; Subsidizes Basic Education in 24 Provinces and Cities</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 4th] This year, the central government has allocated 800 billion yuan for basic education subsidies to various regions. In addition to the direct allocation of funds to the education departments of various provinces and cities by the Ministry of Education, 224.5 billion yuan has been retained by the ministry to purchase books, instruments, and equipment on behalf of the provinces, including children's books, reference books for elementary school teachers, books for teacher training, and remedial education books. Except for remedial education books, instruments and equipment, for which the selection catalog is still being prepared, all other items have been selected. The Ministry of Education has contacted 15 bookstores in Shanghai, including Commercial Press, Zhonghua Book Company, Zhengzhong Book Company, Far East Book Co., World Book Company, Children's Book Company, Kaiming Bookstore, New Asia Book Company, and Da Zhongguo Book Company. Since book prices have risen to 50,000 times their original value since May 25, the Ministry of Education negotiated a price of 40,000 times the original value. A total of 142.4 billion yuan worth of books were purchased. The Ministry of Education signed contracts with the bookstores to purchase the books and send them directly to 24 provinces and cities, including Anhui, Jiangxi, Hubei, Hunan, Sichuan, Kangding, Pingyuan, Hebei, Shanxi, Henan, Shaanxi, Gansu, Qinghai, Ningxia, Taiwan, Guangxi, Yunnan, Guizhou, Chahar, Suiyuan, Ningxia, Xinjiang, Rehe, and Xi'an. Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Beijing, Shanghai, Guangdong, and other provinces and cities will make their own purchases. This purchase is limited to items that are urgently needed and have already been published. Forty-six kinds of children's books were selected. The amount of allocation to each province varies, depending on the funds retained by the Ministry. On average, each central national school can receive a set of books. Fourteen kinds of reference books for elementary school teachers, totaling 108 volumes, were selected and combined into a set, costing 11.5 million yuan per set. A total of 3,000 sets were purchased. On average, each county or city can be allocated one or two sets. Forty kinds of reference books for teacher training were selected. The 24 provinces and cities mentioned above have a total of 688 normal schools, and each school will receive one copy.</p>

<p>Literary History</p>
<h3>A Study of "South Liang" as Written on the Surviving Fragments of Shou Wen's Rhyme Book</h3>
<p>— Tang Lan</p>
<p>The surviving fragments of Shou Wen's rhyme book unearthed from Dunhuang are inscribed with "Written by the Han Buddhist monk Shou Wen of South Liang." Because Shou Wen's affairs are unverifiable, this inscription is a very important piece of material for researching Shou Wen.</p>
<p>Regarding the three characters "Han Buddhist monk" in this inscription, Mr. Luo Xintian stated in his postscript to the fragments that they were "to distinguish him from the Indian Sramanas" (Collected Papers of the Institute of History and Philology, Series 3, Part 2), which is generally credible. Concerning "South Liang," Mr. Luo said, "It does not indicate a dynasty, but rather a prefecture or city," and further stated, "After the Tang dynasty, only Zhu Wen's state was named Liang, but its initial capital was Kaifeng, and later it moved to Luoyang, neither of which can be prefixed with 'South.' Therefore, South Liang clearly does not refer to a dynasty." Besides a dynasty, it can only be said to be a "prefecture or city," but in the Tang dynasty, there was only South Liang Prefecture during the fourth year of Wude (621 AD), which was separated from Tanzhou and located in present-day Baoqing, Hunan. However, it was changed to Shaozhou during the Zhenguan era and then to Shaoling Commandery during the Tianbao era. This ephemeral prefecture name would not likely have been used by anyone at the end of the Tang dynasty. Therefore, Mr. Luo further suspected that this was the "South Liang" of the Tian Wan family in the Records of the Grand Historian. The "Annotations on the Records of the Grand Historian" quotes the "Geography of the Tai Kang Era of Jin" as saying:</p>
<p>During the Warring States period, Liang was called South Liang to</p>
<p>distinguish it from Greater Liang and Lesser Liang. It is believed that customs persisted, and since the Tang people often called Bianzhou "Greater Liang," perhaps they also called the old Liang County west of Linru "South Liang."</p>
<p>However, the Ming Dynasty Buddhist monk Zhen Kong's "Collection of Rhyme Penetration Pearls" provides a general introduction to the sources, stating:</p>
<p>Yang Xiong created rhymes in the Yewang chapter, Monk Shou Wen transmitted the alphabet. Like the son Guanyin, he established and created, The five sounds of breathing are from Xuanyuan.</p>
<p>The Great Tang monk Shou Wen established this framework, there must be an external source. Later, Chief Monk Shou Wen of Liangshan added six mothers to harmonize the palace and shang tones. He is also called "Chief Monk Shou Wen of Liangshan." Mr. Luo mentioned in a footnote, saying:</p>
<p>Does this so-called Liangshan refer to the mountain where Shou Wen resided? Or does it refer to Liangshan County, which belongs to Wanzhou in the Southern Circuit of Tang? Or is it simply a corruption transmitted from "South Liang"? For a time, I suspected that I could not decide and will await further study.</p>
<p>This doubtful case has been on my mind for eight or nine years. What initially caught my attention was Mr. Zhao Yinzhao, who suspected that "Liangshan" was the name of a mountain, a mountain in Hunan, and not a county. I remember he found a genealogy of many monks from Liangshan, but unfortunately, they were all from the Song and Yuan dynasties, and still, no clues could be found.</p>
<p>Recently, someone told me that Mr. Zhou Yiliang had once said that Liangshan was in Sichuan, which probably refers to Liangshan County of Wanzhou, which belonged to the Shannan East Circuit during the Tang dynasty.</p>
<p>In fact, the "South Liang" written by Shou Wen should be Nanzheng County in present-day Shaanxi. Chapter 190 of the "Extensive Records of the Taiping Era," under the entry for Wen Zao, says:</p>
<p>During the reign of Emperor Xianzong, the Rong and Jie barbarians caused chaos in China,</p>
<p>and teachers from all sides were used to quell the border troubles. An edict was issued to "South Liang" to raise 15,800 armored soldiers and send them to the passes. The general who was about to rise up instigated a rebellion, expelled his superior, and, fearing the court's conquest, gathered together those who refused orders for more than a year. Emperor Xianzong was deeply troubled by this and searched for a general for a long time. Wen Zao, the magistrate of Jingzhao, requested to go, and the emperor asked him about the supplies and expenses of the army. Wen said, "I will go without requesting a single soldier or an inch of weaponry." When he reached the border, the people of "Liang" spied and saw that he was only a scholar. They all congratulated each other, saying, "The court will surely not question their crime, so what else is there to worry about?" Wen only proclaimed the imperial edict to reassure and appease them, and upon arriving, he did not ask about anything. However, the "Liang" generals, burdened with their misdeeds, did not discard their weapons when they went in and out, and Wen also did not distrust them. One day, a musical performance was set up in the polo field, and all the lower ranks of the three armies were allowed to bring their bows and swords. They were then ordered to eat in the long corridor, sitting in two rows north and south of the steps, with two long ropes. Each soldier was ordered to hang his bow and arrows on the rope in front of him while eating. After a while, when the wine came around, with a shout, the two ends of the rope were pulled together, and the swords were three zhang above the ground. The soldiers were in great chaos, unable to use their courage, and then the doors were closed and they were all beheaded, more than five thousand people, and not a single one survived. Among them were many commoners who came to the banquet to accompany their relatives and substitutes, and both the worthy and the unworthy were destroyed together. Since then, the people of "South" have not dared to rebel for generations. I served in that place twenty years ago, and the elders still vividly remember it. – From "Wang's Observations"</p>
<p>This story is recorded in the Tang history. The "Old Book of Tang, Biography of Wen Zao" says:</p>
<p>In the fourth year of Taihe (830 AD), the Xingyuan army rebelled and killed the military commissioner Li Feng. Emperor Wenzong, considering that Zao had a strong sense of justice and hated evil, appointed him as Inspector of the Right Scattered Cavalry Attendants, Magistrate of Xingyuan, and Military Commissioner of the Shannan West Circuit. Zao resigned and went to his post, reporting to the emperor the chaotic state of Xingyuan, and Wenzong fully understood its root causes, allowing him to act at his discretion. The emperor, concerned about the cost of using troops, Zao reported: "I estimate that the troops of all circuits who conquered the barbarians have already returned. I hope that when I arrive in Baoxian, I will be granted a secret edict to restrict and bind them, so that they will arrive one after another along with my troops from Xingyuan. This will be sufficient." He then granted Zao four secret edicts, ordering the Shence Army General Dong Chongzhi, the Hedong General Wen Dehou, the Heyang General Liu Shihe, and others to all receive Zao's orders. Zao traveled to Baocheng, where he met Wei Zhizhong, the Xingyuan General who had returned from conquering the barbarians. Zao immediately retained him for self-defense, secretly conspired with Zhizhong, and also summoned the sub-generals Zhang Pi and Li Shaozhi to verify their intentions. When they set out for the prefectural city, he used 800 men as a guard team and 500 men as the vanguard. The vanguard entered the palace and divided up to guard the gates. Zao got out of the car and set up a tent, and the officials supplied the accounts at the tent. Zao said, "This place is narrow and not enough for the soldiers. Move it to the ya gate." After sitting down, the generals and soldiers lined up, and Zhizhong's soldiers surrounded them. Zao said: "I want to ask the new army about their intentions to stay or go. Let them all come forward, and the old army must not act rashly." After inquiring and greeting them, he ordered them to sit down. Those who had not arrived were ordered to carry wine and patrol around, and when the wine had gone around, those who had not arrived had all arrived, and the yamen soldiers also closed in. The seated soldiers did not realize what was happening. Zao raised his hand to signal them to rise, but Zao shouted at them, and they dared not move. He then summoned the seated soldiers and questioned them about the killing of Feng. Zhizhong and Zhang Pi stood on either side of the steps, drew their swords, and shouted, "Kill!" The surrounding soldiers attacked together, and the rebel leaders, including the training envoy Qiu Chou and more than a thousand officers and soldiers, were all beheaded on the spot, and blood flowed in all directions.</p>
<p>The "Extensive Records" differs from the "Old Book of Tang" in two major points. First, the "Extensive Records" is set during the reign of Emperor Xianzong, while the "Old Book of Tang" is set in the fourth year of Taihe during the reign of Emperor Wenzong. Second, the "Extensive Records" is set in "South Liang," also called "Liang," while the "Old Book of Tang" is set in "Xingyuan."</p>
<p>The "Extensive Records" notes that this story is "From Wang's Observations." This book is now lost. The "Extensive Records" quotes it 29 times, also calling it "Wang's Records," most of which are stories from the Former Shu during the Five Dynasties period, and often mentions Wang Renyu's experiences. It should be the "Wang Renyu's Records" in three volumes in the "Song History, Treatise on Literature." According to the "History of the Five Dynasties, Chapter 57, Biography of Wang Renyu":</p>
<p>When Emperor Zhuangzong of Tang pacified Shu, Renyu was later appointed</p>
<p>as a judge for the Qinzhou military commission. When Wang Sitong was stationed in Xingyuan, he was recruited as an aide. Later, Wang Sitong was defeated by the deposed emperor. "Wang's Observations" also has an entry on Wang Sitong, found in Chapter 459 of the "Extensive Records." According to the "History of the Five Dynasties, Biography of Wang Sitong":</p>
<p>When Shi Jingtang attacked Dong Zhang, Sitong was the commander of the vanguard. His troops entered Jianmen, but the rear army did not follow. Sitong fought Zhang and was defeated and retreated. After Jingtang's troops withdrew, Sitong was transferred to Shannan West Circuit. Soon after, he was again appointed as the Magistrate of Jingzhao and the Western Capital Garrison Commander. It can be seen that Wang Sitong was stationed in Xingyuan and recruited Wang Renyu as an aide, which should have been after the first or second year of Changxing of Emperor Mingzong of Later Tang and before the first year of Yingshun of the Han Emperor (931-934 AD).</p>
<p>The incident of Wen Zao killing the rebel soldiers in Xingyuan occurred much earlier, in the fourth year of Taihe of Emperor Wenzong of Tang (830 AD). Chapter 310 of the "Extensive Records of the Taiping Era, Wang Qi" quotes the "Records of Hedong" and the "Chronicles of Han" as being consistent. By the time Wang Renyu became an aide, more than a hundred years had passed. Stories heard from the elders are very prone to errors in dating. Moreover, Wang himself said, "I served in that place twenty years ago." It can be seen that when he wrote this story, it was already during the Later Zhou period (after 951 AD). According to his biography, he died in the third year of Xiande of the Zhou Dynasty at the age of seventy-seven, so he was probably in his seventies when he wrote the book. Such miscellaneous records, relying entirely on memory and not consulting books, inevitably make the mistake of confusing Wenzong with Xianzong.</p>
<p>However, place names are not easily mistaken. This story happened in Xingyuan. Wang Renyu served as an aide to the military commissioner of the Shannan West Circuit in his fifties, right in Xingyuan, so he said, "I served in that place twenty years ago." He heard the story locally, so he could not have misremembered the place. Now, he replaces Xingyuan with "South Liang," or "Liang," both of which appear, and the only possible explanation is that Xingyuan was also called "South Liang" or "Liang."</p>
<p>Xingyuan had been called Liangzhou since the end of the Wei Kingdom during the Three Kingdoms period. Liangzhou was established in the first year of Wude of the Tang Dynasty, changed to Baozhou in the thirteenth year of Kaiyuan, and then changed back to Liangzhou after only seven years, until Emperor Dezong fled west in 784 AD and changed it to Xingyuan Prefecture. By the time Wang Renyu became an aide, less than 150 years had passed, and it is not problematic that the old name "Liang" was still preserved among the people. This place originally belonged to Former Shu. After the fall of Shu, it became part of Later Tang, so Wang Sitong could be a military commissioner. When Wang Sitong became the Magistrate of Jingzhao and the Western Capital Garrison Commander again, Zhang Qianzhao succeeded him as the military commissioner. In the first year of Yingshun, Wang Sitong fought against the deposed emperor and was defeated. After that, Zhang Qianzhao submitted to Meng Zhixiang. Therefore, when Wang Renyu wrote this story, Xingyuan was actually part of Meng Shu's territory.</p>
<p>Wang Renyu was a native of Qinzhou, a former official of Former Shu, and had lived in Xingyuan, so he was very familiar with the local situation. When casually recording this story, he didn't say Xingyuan or Nanzheng, but wrote "Liang" or "South Liang." This shows that it must have been a very common alternate name at that time. But why add the word "South" to "Liang"? According to my speculation, Xingyuan is in Shannan, and Hancheng, north of the mountains, is the ancient Liang Kingdom, which is said to be the "Liang" and "Qi" mentioned in the Yu Gong's "Governing." And Xingyuan, also called Liangzhou, is said to be the "Liangzhou" in Yu Gong's "Huayang and Heishui are only in Liangzhou." If Hancheng, north of the mountains, is considered "Liang," then Xingyuan, south of the mountains, is naturally "South Liang." Furthermore, looking at it from a closer perspective, near Qianxian, which is the Fengtian County of the Tang Dynasty, is also Liangshan. During Emperor Dezong's time in Fengtian, Gao Chongjie and Zhu Ci's general Li Riyue fought here. It is precisely one south and one north with Xingyuan.</p>
<p>As for Zhen Kong calling Shou Wen "Chief Monk Shou Wen of Liangshan," this is easily explained. Southeast of Nanzheng is Liangzhou Mountain, also called Liangshan. The "Taiping Huanyu Ji" quotes the Erya: "Among the beauties of the south are the rhinoceros and elephants of Liangshan," saying that the prefecture is named after the mountain, which seems to also be called "South Liang." There is also a Zhongliang Mountain in the west. During the Five Dynasties, there was Monk Zungu of Zhongliang Mountain in Xingyuan Prefecture, as seen in Chapter 15 of the "Jingde Records of the Transmission of the Lamp."</p>
<p>Liangzhou Mountain is very large, with more than thirty li of open land in the middle, which is said to be the former county seat. Shou Wen probably resided there. Unfortunately, people at that time only valued discussion and preparation, and the deeds of the place were not investigated at all.</p>
<p>We speculate that he was a person from the late Tang or Five Dynasties period. Now, the place name "South Liang" happens to appear in the records of people from the Five Dynasties period. This limited material is very precious. Wang Renyu (880-956 AD) was famous for his literature during the Five Dynasties period, and he also wrote "Idle Talk of Yutang," which is also lost. It is quoted a lot in the "Extensive Records of the Taiping Era." This book, "Wang's Observations," is a miscellaneous record, many of which are related to historical facts and not fictitious novels. It is a pity that it is buried in the "Extensive Records of the Taiping Era," which is full of gods, monsters, and goblins.</p>
