<h3>美軍船隻裝載軍品兩星期內走趕運來華　軍援款已撥一億餘美元</h3>
<p>〔中央社華盛頓卅一日合衆電〕據悉：用以援助中國政府之首批「大量」美國軍事供應品，將於兩週內趕運赴華。此批軍品原定於十二月間租船啓運，今將由陸海軍輪隻載運，故可不受西海岸船運罷工之影響，同時國務院發言人稱：美政府已以一億零五百萬美元之軍事援助款項，撥予中國政府，爲國會通過之援華剿共款項一億二千五百萬元之百分之八十五。按國務院上次關於援華情形之報吿，係於十月十一日發表，彼時據稱已曾以八千八百廿七萬五千元撥交中國政府，宣布上述消息者拒不說明此批「大量」軍品之性質，僅稱現正由陸軍軍械司辦理中，此可能卽係各種槍砲，彈藥，坦克曁軍用車輛皆有之之謂。此批軍事供應品中，如有飛機，則相信美空軍將負責此種飛機之啓運事宜，軍品運華工作之消息，恰與來自南京之沉悶新聞同時發出。此間華方某高級官員承認，局勢頗爲嚴重，但渠稱外傳種種猜測多距事實甚遠，現國會監督援外委會正在密切注意中國之局勢，日前該會已宣布派前駐蘇大使蒲立德爲特使，赴華調查該國情勢，以便向國會提出建議，蒲氏近已與杜魯門脫離政治關係，渠定本月九日啓程赴華，蒲氏與委負會主席勃里奇皆爲主張以更多之軍事援助給予中國之知名人士，蒲氏赴華任務發表後，各方皆信如杜威當選總統，美政府之對華政策，將迅速改變，按照現行程序，中國須以美國務院撥交該國之款項，購買其所需之軍事用品，國務院不能參與軍品之採購事宜，唯美國軍事當局可在華方請求之下，代爲採購。據悉：陸軍方面已獲得其待運赴華之軍品。</p>
<p>〔中央社華盛頓卅一日電〕美國國務院今晚宣布：迄今止，於一億二千五百萬美元軍事援華款項中，現已撥出一億五百萬美元予美國海陸空軍部，購置武器軍火及其他軍事設備，交付中國。國務院發言人稱：國務院於十月七日曾向杜魯門總統報吿，援華計劃中現已撥付八百五十萬元交與中國，但自彼時起，中國政府曾增加訂購武器軍火及其他戰爭物資之貨單。渠稱國務院尙不悉此項款額究有若干係爲中國海陸空軍之用，但所有此項新定貨單，均於東北最近軍事演變之先，卽由中國政府交由訂購者。該發言人指出，國務院可望於一日宣布，將援華款項中另一筆數百萬元之款項撥付中國政府。</p>
<h3>美駐華顧問團改組　聯合軍事顧問團　何應欽巴大維來滬視察</h3>
<p>〔美國新聞處華盛頓一日電〕美國防部長一日宣布：自一九四八年十一月一日起，美國將成立駐華聯合軍事顧問團。</p>
<p>此一聯合軍事顧問團將代替現在之軍事顧問團（包括空軍，地面部隊及混合部隊）與海軍顧問團調査委員會。美國駐華聯合軍事顧問團將包括陸軍顧問組，空軍顧問組，海軍顧問組及混合部隊顧問組。各組由主任一名管理，並由副主任一名或一名以上及職員等襄助一切。巴大維少將，湯麥斯凖將，奧爾特海軍少將及達萊上校等，將繼續分別祖任陸軍顧問組，空軍顧問組，海軍顧問組及混合部隊顧問組各組主任。華盛頓聯合參謀長已指定巴大維少將爲美國駐華聯合軍事顧問團團長。駐華美國聯合軍事顧問團之使命，仍與軍事顧問團無異。</p>
<p>〔中央社本市訊〕據此間有關方面消息：國防部長何應欽偕美軍顧問團長巴大維定二日由京專機來滬，視察有關軍事機構。</p>
<h3>經總援華總支出共達一億餘美元</h3>
<p>〔美國新聞處華盛頓卅一日電〕截至十月二十七日爲止之一星期內，經濟合作總署所通過之對華支出，其總額前後共達一一〇，九六八，三八一美元，另加星期五所宣佈之新核准額三百五十萬美元。</p>
<h3>紐約時報社論評述瀋陽之失</h3>
<p>張調美政府政策錯誤</p>
<p>〔合衆社紐約一日電〕紐約時報一日社論，評述瀋陽之陷落稱：雖然歐洲在防衛共產主義中依舊必須佔優先之地位，但吾人決不能忽視赤色亞洲對世界之危機」。</p>
<p>該報稱：中國因工業之落後及抗戰中之大量破壞，在對抗共產黨之戰事中，渠必須大量依賴外援，瀋陽之陷落，不但使中國損失富饒之東九省，而且說明了以下的事實：此一廣大的富饒區域，係自日本手中奪回，預定歸還中國，但現在則由蘇聯第五縱隊以類似日本征服東北之形式，將其奪去。</p>
<p>在述及中國之困難及急待援助後，該報繼稱；一但曾以白銀政一策給予中國困難及默認蘇聯在東北擴展勢力之美國，在此種援助上却遲遲不決，因爲，適與美國之歐洲政策相反，美國並無同時援助中國之兩洋政策，而行政當局始而希望使中國共產黨參加中國政府，繼而取消業已允許之貸款，並以軍火禁運令對付中國，在共和黨之壓力下，此種政策始行轉變，但四月間國會通過之軍事援助，仍未有一物抵達中國。</p>
<p>該報稱：以前一切關于中國政府形將崩潰之可怖警吿，由于中國之實力，得安全渡過，「吾人仍希望中國之堅撓不屈，將能再度克眼一切困難」。</p>

<h3>看今天美國選舉總統</h3>
<p>舉世矚目的美國總統選舉今天開始進行了，全國選民九千五百萬人均將投其神聖的一票，在杜威與杜魯門二人之間抉擇其一。投票的結果如何，在投票的前夕，自不能輕下斷語，而且雙方均有獲勝的信心，例如杜魯門在其故鄉表示，「民主黨此次競選必能獲勝」！杜威則在紐約宣稱，「今已至勝利前夕」；但據美國各界所舉行的民意測騐，都預料杜威當選總統爲最有希望，就是我們以常識來判斷，也相信杜威獲勝較有把握。所以，這次美國總統競選，對於美國的內政外交以至世界局勢，都有非常重大影響，實在値得我們重視。</p>
<p>美國民主黨自故總統羅斯福於一九三三年入主白宮實行新政以來，掌握政權將近十六年之久，對於美國以至全世界的功勳，在美國人民的心底是永遠不可磨滅的，不僅挽救了美國的經濟危機，而且也消滅了美國生活方式所戚受的威脅，論理民主黨的獲勝是沒有問題的。但是大戰勝利結束後的國內外局勢，却未能事事如意，戰後世界危機的迫切，增加了美國對於世界的責任戚，而杜魯門總統的對外政策，不免舉棋不定，不論是杜魯門總統所標榜的「杜魯門主義」，或是馬歇爾國務卿所主持的「援外計劃」，都沒有普遍的澈底執行，以致美國在「冷戰」之中，步步退却，着着落後，尤其在亞洲，不僅東南亞已感受共產主義的威脅，而且東北亞也將陷於共產國際的掌握之中，對華政策更鑄成歷史性的錯誤，使民主黨失去了美國人民的信心。再加以美國內在的危機，尤其是經濟恐慌的黑影，投射在每一個人的心頭，因此造成美國人民對於民主黨的厭倦心理及失望情緒，由厭倦與失望，乃引起「人心思變」的結果，給共和黨以東山再起的機會。其實，杜威獲勝的希望，也就在這裏。</p>
<p>以民主黨和共和黨的本質而論，根本就沒有多大出入。一般憲政學者批評美國兩大政黨說；〔民主共和兩黨好比是貼了各不相同的商標的兩個酒瓶，在表面上看來，是性質截然不同的兩種酒，但是打開瓶來，都是空無一物的」。準此而論，我們對於白宮主人的更迭，由民主黨的杜魯門變爲共和黨的杜威，原不必抱着過分的奢望；無論如何，美國的國策在原則上也是不會有重大變動的。不過在執行國策時，兩黨的更迭，終不免有輕重緩緊之分，尤其是馬歇爾的「先歐後亞」的援外政策，杜威是否承襲衣鉢，當成問題。按杜威曾抨擊民主黨的對華政策，他說：「杜魯門政府不僅缺乏促進和平之政策，反而處處助長蘇聯侵略世界的力量；在遠東方面，美國不惜犧牲中國，與史達林妥協，使其得控制中國的東北」，蒲立德先生不久奉命來華，實地考察中國政情，將隨時以其所見所聞吿知杜威。所以，我們預料杜威當選總統之後，最低限度，美國的對華政策當必有所更改。</p>
<p>惟依照美國憲政慣例，新總統當選之後，須至明年一月二十日，始能到白宮總統府就職視事。從十一月至明年一月廿日，可以說是美國政治上的「眞空」時期。在環球氣壓低沉人心不安的今日，我們對於二個多月的美國「政治眞空」時間，不能不感到惶惑和憂懼。目前雖已有人建議，若選舉揭曉，一旦杜威當選，杜威應卽發表宣言，預先宣佈新政府的政策，但是這一紙宣言，有何何種安定的力量，實屬可疑。我們認爲，爲今之計，唯有將危急的局勢，訴諸杜魯門政府的責任感，如能倣效當年羅斯福當選，總統後，前任胡佛總統未交卸時，凡有重大事件，率先徵詢羅氏政見的辦法，在這二個多月中，杜魯門總統能完全明瞭，今日嚴重的局勢，已使美國不能不越出憲政的常軌，立卽執行下屆總統所宣佈的新政策，以塡補這個「政治眞空」，則對於美國，對於全世界必有甚大的裨益。</p>
<h3>限價開放市塲仍冷落　各地議訂新價中　食糧菜蔬上漲數倍不等</h3>

<h3>美今日舉行大選　杜威勢將躍登總統寳座杜魯門仍具有極大信心　兩黨正副總統候選人籲請人民投票</h3>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓一日電〕政治測騐今日一致表示，美國選民明日將選出二十年內第一個共和黨總統。投票所將於日出時開門，預料投票者將在四千七百萬至五千萬人之間，然全國合格選民此次恐將有半數放棄權利·共和黨之續保衆議院多數，似已不成問題，然席數恐稍有减少，至於參院，則角逐結果，尙不能卜，共和黨優勢頗生問題，民主黨有望與共和黨平分秋色，各佔四十八席，甚至超過對方，目前之席數爲共和黨五十一席，民主黨四十五席。共和黨正副總統候選人杜威及華倫今晚將假各大廣播公司向全國演說。而其後不久民主黨正副候選人杜魯門及巴克萊將繼之廣播。傳統上各總統候選人之最後一次演說，其旨不在競選，而在籲請選民投票。雖今年不免循例有此一舉，然本屆競選允爲近世競選史上凶猛之一頁。明日除選舉總統外，尙須選出衆議員四三二人，參議員三十二人及州長三十二人及數萬地方官吏。杜魯門已返抵故鄕密蘇里州獨立城，將留待選舉結果之揭曉。杜威則返抵紐約州鄉間別居，一日下午入紐約市共和黨總部，專待佳音。</p>
<p>〔合衆社紐約卅一日電〕各總統候選人將於一日晚發表樂觀之最後演說，而結束一九四八年之總統競選運動。紐約州長杜威顯有獲勝把握。杜魯門總統現仍希望能獲大批選票，而推翻一般預料。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社聖路易斯三十日電〕米蘇里政界認爲，自競選開始以後，杜魯門當選之機會似已增加，然欲擊敗杜威，則除非有奇蹟之發現。據觀察家猜測，杜魯門雖盡力拉六千萬工人之選票，然工人大多仍將投杜威之票，此間觀察家末稱：在米蘇里杜魯門當可獲得勝利。</p>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓一日電〕據氣象台預測：二日全美舉行選舉之時，全國大部份地區天氣晴期，民主黨發言人立卽表示：渠深信晴朗之氣候將使杜魯門獲得六千萬以上之選票，而當選爲白宮主人，共和黨對渠等獲勝之機會，保持樂觀。</p>
<h3>美選舉一般程序　全國人民首選出選舉人總統議員州長由此產生</h3>
<p>〔美國新聞處華盛頓一日電〕美國選舉人團並不直接投票自候選人中推選總統，實際上人民投票選舉「選舉人」，然後再由「選舉人」在選舉會中自候選人中推選總統。選舉人票共有五百三十一票，當選之總統候選人至少須獲其中之二百六十六票，苟任何候選人不能獲得必要之票數，則選舉可能陷于僵持狀態茍苟屬如此，總統將由美衆院推選。</p>
<p>今年，選舉人團不僅將選舉總統與副總統，並將選舉美參院九十六位議負中之卅二人，美衆院四百三十五位議員中之四百三十二人，四十八位州長中之卅二人以及許多州與市府官員。就全國言之，除總統之競爭外，民主共和兩黨爲控制參院而進行之競爭日益引起更大之注意。共和黨現爲多數黨。在國會兩院中一黨如能控制任何一院，則該院之主席以及各委會中之大多歡席次與主腦人物卽屬諸該黨。苟美國已屆投票年齡之男女公民至今猶不知各候選人之容貌主張及其公私生活情形，此實非候選人之過失或美國新聞機關之過失。</p>

<h3>全市各業會議　市長議長等致詞諄諄告誡　調整貨價須合理勿辜負政府苦心　通過臨時動議兩起　請釋被捕商人　准以自備外匯輸入工業必需品</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕上海市工業會及市商會爲商討限價開放後之本市物價問題，特於昨午五時，在市商會大禮堂召集各業會員舉行會議。出席吳市長·潘議長·吳局長·駱淸華·杜月笙·徐學禹。等及各業公會理事長共四百餘人。會議由徐理事長寄廎主持。歷二小時始散。會中通過臨時動議二起：（一）通電全國商會，請求中央釋放在財政緊急處分令下，被拘之正當商人。（二）請中央准許以自備外匯輸入工業必需品。</p>
<p>當主席徐寄廎致簡單開會詞後，首由吳市長致詞略稱：自中央宜佈取消限價後，地方政府及社會局對於今後之物價問題，不得不與工商界方面作周密談商，本人認爲目前各位對政府應有共同的認識，在過去七十餘天中，政府所以一再變更經濟方針，其動機均在於解救百姓。爲了要戡亂，通貨膨脹自屬難免，而當本年七八月間，通貨趨於惡性膨脹，致民不聊生，工商界困難盧重，政府有鑒於斯，才有改革幣制及實行限價之決定，然限價以後，工廠不能再生產，物資逃避，人民生活更形困苦，於是政府又不得不佈取消限價。固然，經濟問題應以經濟方法來解決，開放限價尙不失爲解決之道，但本人所祖心者，乃過去的現象是「有錢無貨」，今後恐將「有貨無錢」了。今天以前，大家深怕沒吃沒穿，今天之後，五百萬市民又在担心物價之將飛漲。在今天這種局勢下，本人希望工商界都能拿出良心來，商品價格應求合理調整，不能企岡暴利。望各同業公會都能加强組織，幫助政府渡此難關。本人衷心祈禱上海之工商界率先守法，成爲全國之表率。</p>
<h3>應考慮到人民購買力</h3>
<p>繼由社會局長吳開先致詞略稱：政府此次決定取消限價，純粹是爲了解救工商業之危機，因爲今日工商業已到生死存亡關頭。目前最迫切重要的問題，是如何調整成品價格，我希望各業在核定價格時，能攷慮到一個問題——人民的購買力。上海市民經此數度變化，購買力確已普遍衰退，今天眞是已到民窮財盡地步，各位亦應孜慮到如何使窮人繼續活下去，因爲這是上海安定的因素。各業核本定價務求合理，成本高者核價高，但原料由政府配給者，其成本甚低，核價卽應降低。又如此次搶購風潮中，各業均有損失，但程度不同，如以棉布業論，布店均被搶購一空，損失慘重，但廠方損失卽較輕，批發商更輕，又如絨綫業損失更微，故各業核定新價時，應視實際成本需要，務求公允合理。</p>
<h3>務須近科情理勿使市民起反感</h3>
<p>繼由潘議長致詞稱：所謂非常時期，決不是尋常道理行得通的時期。當八一九限價政策發表後，兄弟卽晋京分向總統及王部長等陳述，請求中央相信人民，任何政策，必須得到人民合作才能成功。希望政府相信公會，運用公會，但可惜當時未經採納。事到如今，已不在檢討淸算以前責任問題了，目前應着重者，是今後物價如何控制？從今天起，要看商會及同業公會自己顏色了。因爲以前我們有理由可以推卸責任，而如今政府旣已相信了我們，如果再弄不好，那就是自食其果，就是該死·如果各同業公會不在現時發揮良知，貪圖暴利，那麼再過一個月，人民要忘記限價之苦，而抱怨物價之飛漲，所以我們萬不能辜負政府之一番苦心，各業核定價格時，應以最低之實際成本爲準繩，如曾得政府配紗者，其成本卽極低，且近兩月來公用事榮價格未動，亦足使製成品價格降低，故在第一次議價時，務須近乎情理，卽不致引起市民反感·總之，工商界同仁都應認淸一點，若共匪到了，上海卽成爲蘇聯的作戰基地。我們究竟願做蘇聯的附庸，還是願爲民主國而作戰？深盼工商界企業界均盡本份，協助民主政府抵抗共匪作亂。</p>
<h3>先行商一假定價格</h3>
<p>繼由駱淸華致詞略稱目前一切經濟軌道均呈紊亂，成本核算爲難，但是我們必須遵照市政當局的指示，各業先行商定假定價格，使明日有貨應市。合理價格當再從長核議。</p>
<h3>各業紛紛提出意見</h3>
<p>至此，鞋帽業公會楊撫生，絲織業公會劉慶一，烟兌業公會劉頤和，書業公會李伯嘉等，紛紛提出意見，由吳局長綜合答覆稱：議價之範圍，僅限於日用必需品，包括項目不多，一二日內卽可公佈之。凡不屬於日用必需品者不加管制，可先由同業公會按生產成本核定價格，送由社會局核定之。</p>
<p>末由杜月笙氏勸導各業，須平心靜氣，擁護政府，協助政府，俾共渡難關，大會至七時始散。</p>
<h3>對調整工資問題定今日召集會議</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕限價開放後之工資問題，經管補充辦法規定參照維持工人生活之需要，授權地方主管機關核定之。社會局吳局長定今日下午三時，在局邀集中央農工部副部長陸京士及市商會，市工業會，總工會及工人福利委員會等代表吳蘊初，潘士浩，汪竹一，姚書紳，水鮮雲，屬學湘，葉翔皋，章祝三等共同商討。吳局長表示渠已擬有腹稿，待徵集各方意見後再作決定。是否採取依照生活指數計薪，尙朱決定。</p>
<h3>供應局調劑市面今續撥物資出售</h3>
<p>物資供應局之二十餘家剩餘物資代售處，昨日營業奇旺，所有存貨及罐頭食品，於下午二時前，卽全部售罄。該局定今日再續撥大批食品及其他物資分售，以調劑市面，並規定各該代售處決不得私自提高售價。</p>
<h3>舞應代徵安家費即日起開始實行</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕本市兵役協會對本年度申請免緩徵召之複審事宜，昨起已開始工作。至各舞廳照茶資一倍代徵新兵安家費辦法，該會昨亦已通知全市各舞廳卽日實行，將來此項代徵款額卽全部撥充新兵安家費。同時本市附有舞池音樂設備之各酒菜飯館，該會已在着手調査，並硏訂代徵辦法及數目。</p>
<h3>蔣經國表示歉意發表敬告市民書</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕蔣經國於昨日發表敬吿市民書，全文如次：『在七十天的工作中，我傑深感覺沒有盡到自己所應盡的責任，不但沒有完成計劃和任務，而在若干地方，反加重了上海市民在工作過程中所感受的痛苦。我決不願將自己應負的責任，推到任何人身上去，同時也決不因遇着挫折，而致放棄自己的政治主張。我堅決相信自己所指出的「上海往何處去』的道路，是絕對正確的。今天除了向政府自請處分以明責任外，並向上海市民表示最大的歉意，這裏我並非想求得市民的原諒，而是表明自己對市民應負的責任心。我懇切希望上海市民應用自己的力量，不再讓投機奸商官僚政客和地痞流氓來控制上海，我始終認爲上海的前途一定是光明的。』</p>
<h3>經管當局幾點主張　限價原料所製商品應予收購配給市民　正當商人蒙受損失亦應予以補償</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕限價開放後，經管處負責人於昨日午後五時，破例親自在央行會議室正式招待記者，强調表示限價雖取消，政府仍不應聽任奸商乘機發大財。貨價自明日起將面目一新，但不少商品爲在「八一九」以前卽已囤積，或在管制實施後，以配得之限價原料及限價工資製造者。尤以紗絲兩項，紡建及中信局均有配售，商人不應藉限價之開放而獲致暴利，故已函請市政府對此類貨物予以收購，按限價配給市民，以昭公允。再則一般小本經營之正當商人，例如棉布店南貨店，確曾按限價出售其所有貨物，致今日已蒙受巨大損失，本人希望市政府能將上項收購之貨物，配售一部份與此類商店，否則奉公守法者吃虧，太不公道。</p>
<p>全力偵查　未兌金鈔</p>
<p>又金鈔收兌截止後，經檢委員會將致全力於偵查未兌出之金鈔，查出者卽予以沒收。本人對兌出金鈔之市民，今日遭受重大損失，咸覺十分過意不去，今後如不加强檢査未兌出者，更將有愧於心。爲求有效完成任務起見，現正硏究一種不擾民之吿密辦法。</p>
<p>配給制度　希望加強</p>
<p>今後管制工作移至地方政府，本人認爲配給制度最能穩定物價鎭定人心，希望市府能加强辦理，十一·十二月份之油糖煤三種物資，經管處仍可負責供應。又經管處所屬之三個委員會，今後仍繼續存在，內中檢查委員會之工作，將集中於偵査未兌出之金鈔。過去經管處所沒收之非法貨物，將移交央行，作今後救濟難民之用。</p>
<p>有以進退問題詢之者，則不作肯定答覆，僅謂：「在職一日，盡責一日」。</p>
<h3>經管檢查李會今後工作重心　檢査金鈔取締國積</h3>
<p>行政院經濟管制委員會上海區檢査委員會，昨在國行召開會議，首由蔣經國述政府新頒財經補充辦法，繼稱：今後本市物資出境，槪不加以限制，幷經決議今後工作重心分爲（一）加强檢査金鈔，（二）取締奸商囤積。最後並通過檢舉藏有金鈔獎勵吿密辦法。</p>
<h3>戡建隊青年服務隊昨日起均停止活動</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕政府通過經管補充辦法，限價政策取消後，在本市執行監視市塲任務之戡建大隊及大上海靑年服務總隊已於昨日起停止活動。</p>
<h3>物資出境取消限制</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕市警局頃接奉經管督導員辦公處代電，略謂：以前公佈之上海區禁止物資携運出境檢査辦法，上海區出境物資申請携運許可辦法自本日起一律廢止，今後物資出境概不加以限制。</p>
<p>又據督導員辦公處息：物物交換辦法，亦經決定停止實施。</p>
<h3>油行拒絕出油醬酒公會請願</h3>
<p>本市十月份第二期供應市民食油，已由油商業同業公會製就，上項食油准購證，交醬酒商業同業公會分發該會所屬同業具領，詎意領到上項准購證之各零售商號，憑同該證前往油商公會指定</p>
<h3>電影戲劇票價　今起增加倍半　機製煤球商要求漲二倍</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕本市電影與戲劇業，昨呈准社會局，自今日起調整票價，按八一九限價普加百分之一百五十。電影院首輪最低爲一圓，二輪最低六角，三輪最低四角，四輪最低二角五分。</p>
<p>又機製煤球商昨要求社會局調整煤球售價爲每祖十圓，絞八一九限價增加二倍，社會局批示需待中央配煤價格公佈後再議價決定。又據社會局吳局長表示，旅館與飯店亦將實行議價。</p>
<h3>銅銀兩種輔幣日產八十萬枚　如何發行待財部指示</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕五角銀質輔幣，中央造幣廠業於昨日起正式開鑄。該項銀幣每枚重五公分，正面爲總統像，反面兩旁爲嘉禾圖案，中鐫五角兩字。銅模雕刻極爲精緻。據造幣廠韋廠長語記者，該廠目前因爲電力所限，每日銅銀兩種輔幣，總共不過出產八十萬枚，現仍照常運送到央行發行局。如何發行，則有待央行請示財部指示機宜云。</p>

<h3>西寳興路底命　死者身中數彈凶犯均穿軍裝　新生汽車行司機係唯一證人</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕閘北西寳興路底粤秀路聯義山莊（卽林家花園）東首草地近石階處，上月卅日下午五時許，發現被槍殺男子一具，身現彈痕纍纍。經該山莊辦事員張新康報大塲警分局，由張分局長飭刑事股長何培基率股員劉子常馳往査勘。死者穿嶄新花呢西式夾大衣，灰條西裝，白襯衫，黑底白點領帶，絲短襪，黄皮鞋，頭西脚東。在屍身所在之草地上，檢獲大八寸馬牌槍彈亮二枚，幷發現大衣左下部有槍洞二個，左褲脚有一槍洞，胸膊一洞，又在泥土中挖出子彈一粒。死者身畔搜得北平市身份證一紙</p>
<p>上書黃雅南</p>
<p>卅一歲，北平人。皮夾一只附有其昌錢莊支票一張，票面爲金圓七百二十元，又金圓一百卅五元三角。便條一紙，繕就空軍第四大隊隊員張文奇之所在及通訊處等字句。當卽電吿總局攝影股派員下鄕拍照後，用車將屍體載送常德路驗屍所候騐。當時復在該山莊大門口査得停有出差汽車一輛，號碼爲〇三·三一四七號，係吳淞路一六八號新生汽軍行所有。卽傳司機崔昌俊帶局偵訊，據供，是日午後一時許，有二軍人打扮者，操重慶話，來行租車，言明</p>
<p>赴江灣來回</p>
<p>車資金圓金圓二十元，遂經賬房命其駕駛該輛汽車出差。兩軍人登車後卽命向粤秀路駛去，迨抵該路中段時，內中一較長軍人命停駛下車。另一軍人囑車頭掉轉折回上海，至南京中路大新公司附近購買捲烟無着，復駛至卡爾登戲院門口烟攤上買烟後，再至新世界對過馬路下車而去。約等四十分鐘之久，乃偕同一西裝者（卽死者）到來，同乘該車至英士路復興路一小弄口，復令伴駛，兩人下車後，逾十五分鐘始出，再至粤秀路中段地方，較長者之一軍人</p>
<p>已預候該處</p>
<p>經招呼後重登車廂，令直往聯義山莊；謂去散步。在車中時，沿途微聞死者云，在平已包辦喜筵卅桌云云。其他因車聲震動，並未聽悉云云。又據鄕人目擊者云，有軍人越該山莊後圍之鐵絲網，跨小浜而逸。斯案據臆測，起因或爲桃色糾紛，該分局現正偵騎四出跴緝兇犯，歸案究辦。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕本市老北門第一浸會堂，爲茂名北路三五號房屋被轉頂事，昨特招待本市新聞界，對此事有所說明。據稱：該處原爲進德女中校舍之一部份房屋，前於卅一年間，因恐敵寇窺伺，暫行出租與曹芳濤醫師，開設救生製藥廠。詎曹芳濤在租賃期內，復將全部房屋轉頂與王炳榮佔用，而王炳榮又將房屋全部分頂九戶。該堂因校舍亟待應用，曾正式通知對方遷讓，均未履行，故不得已向法院起訴，並請與論界主持正義云。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕市政府於昨日上午九時舉行月會，出席吳市長，沈秘書長，張曉崧及各局處職員等二百餘人，吳市長主席領導行禮後，由民政局長張曉崧報吿淸查戶口工作準備情形，略謂淸査戶口及換發國民身份證準備事宜，民政局及各區保人員日來正加緊工作，昨日起，印就之一部份新身份證，已先送郊區各區公所轉發，今明兩日可發至各市區區公所。約在本月五日，新國民身份證可全部送至各居戶，由市民自行塡寫，幷將舊國民身份證保存，以備在淸査戶口時，由區公所收回·張氏繼稱：淸査戶口日期，決定於本月八日下午九時開始，九日晨一時結束，期在四小時內完成。屆時本市將實施嚴格交通管制，外間謠傳淸查戶口時，將同時搜査金鈔及地下倉庫，絕無此事。爲使全市市民充分明瞭戶口淸査意義及應行注意各點，民政局將會同各電台舉行廣播，將有所說明。</p>

<h3>米市塲恢復交易　南市白粳最高做八十元</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕食糧市塲自經當局恢復自由買賣後，昨日本市南北兩米市塲已有新價做開。南市塲吳江米以每担八十元成交，平稻七三元。北市傷角直米七八元。昨日南北市塲共到米二千餘担，尙無顯著之增加，結果共成交約五百担。</p>
<p>又訊：昨晨新經濟補充辦法公佈後，規定食米自由買賣，各方人心咸表興慰，各地糧源運滬數額續見增多，南市塲薄稻開八十元，早稻七十三元，惟成交不多。到貨米行自運七一八石，經售商自辦八七石二斗五升。北市塲白粳次貨開七八元，其餘未曾交易，米行自運二一三石，米號自辦二七七石，業外自購三三五石，米廠自運七四〇石，二市綜計一九二四石二斗五升。</p>
<p>又訊：昨日雜糧市塲，因當局取消限價，恢復自由買賣，昨日同業自動議價，計漢口乍豆三七元，車豆四〇元，苞米六一元，紅糧四〇元，遲豆四〇元，冬豆四五元，徐州黄豆四五元，但均非成交價格。食油麵粉市塲因未獲合理調整價格，故交易仍在擯持之中云。</p>
<h3>外匯政策暫不變更</h3>
<p>經濟補充辦法實行後，外滙政策，頗爲各方所注意。茲據聯合徵信所記者向有關方面探悉：目前外滙政策，政府尙無變更之象跡。某負責人亦愼重否認調整之傳說，但就目前情形而論，限價取消後，物資之國內外價格，相差懸殊，如再維持此一匯率，則出口物資，恐將陷於絕境。</p>
<p>據消息靈通人士表示：政府對此問題，極爲審愼，決不貿然從事，一俟物價稍爲安定後，當可考慮提高，使物資能源源出口。</p>
<h3>台幣提高比值後游資流台遭阻遏</h3>
<p>政府提高台幣對金圓券之比例爲一千比一，此項決定，對內地游資流向台省之狂瀾，將產生有效之阻遏作用。據悉：自「八一九」迄今，流入台省之資金已達金圓券三千萬以上，所予台省物價之壓力甚大。目前由滬向台滙款，雖已暫時停止，對旅客携帶現款，亦嚴格限制數額，（旅客最多准携金圓一千元，由同業公會理事長證明，前往辦貨可帶二十元，國營省營事業機構公務員，可帶五千元。）但流台資金每日仍逾金圓五萬以上，由台滙滬者，則絕無僅有。此項現象爲「八一九」前所無，彼時由台滙滬，遠較中滬滙台爲多。</p>
<h3>簽發結匯證書規定一式四紙</h3>
<p>國行業務局，頃以第一五九號通函。致各指定銀行，略稱：「關於指定銀行簽發出口結匯證明書CBC86各項手續，業經本行以第一五七號通函規定實施在案，特再函達査照注意，務使按照規定祗許簽發一式四紙，倘由香港或澳門轉出口者，祗得增加特別副本一紙。</p>
<h3>黃金外幣截止收兌通訊申報郵戳爲憑</h3>
<p>卅一日爲收兌黄金外幣限期之最後一日，國行本市部份當日共兌進黄金十八兩零八分五厘，白銀二十七兩零六分，銀元一百十六元五角，銀角四百零八角，美鈔二百二十五元三角五分，港幣十四元六角，菲幣十一比索零六角·收兌黄金外幣限期戳止後，外埠通訊申報，及鄕村巡迴收兌，亦將同時結束。至外埠申報之函件，另在限期（十月卅一）前發遞者，當按郵戮爲憑。</p>
<h3>絲綢業市塲　擬請准予恢復</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕人絲市塲業中頗有恢復交易之意，惟以同業執戶有限，該項貨品國內又無生產，同業無從採購。絲織業需用原料，雖有中信局統籌分配，但因配量不豐，各廠仍感不敷應用。茲以財經補充辦法公佈後，絲織業所有設備，仍擬逐步開工，故需要原料較前尤甚。而自限價以來，進口人絲，無形停頓，綢緞運銷外埠，供應量亦各自减少，此番開放後、各地枯渴已久，採辦量當較八一九前增多。同業爲普遍供應計，擬俟各項物價核議後，再請有關當局准予恢復市塲自由交易云。</p>
<p>綢緞市塲交易，自經濟管制實施後，曾奉社會局通知停止集合，同業賣買，交易無形中擱，絲織業同業公會前爲奉行限價政策，對各廠所有產量，除承配原料須交還成品外，其餘均按各廠產量，交由公會統一配售與另售商，以維門市爭購之急需。批發商在限價下營業已吿停頓，茲以各項物品取消限價，綢緞非主要日用品之類，有關方面仍擬是請當局准予恢復市塲。</p>
<h3>棉布廠商集商議價　龍頭細布塲外最低喊六十元</h3>
<p>昨日棉布交易因廠商正集商議價，由於價格難定，市塲昨日尙未恢復集市。昨日下午，市商會召集各業會商，布號定於今日開市營業。塲外棉布交易，龍頭由六〇元喊起，最高抵七十五元有成交，四君子嗶嘰八〇元，一九〇號高檔士林布一四〇元云。</p>
<p>又訊：中國紡建公司亦暫停配售，須由中央主管機關，核定價格後，再行辦理。至染織廠出品之各種布疋，亦於調整成本後，廠盤方能開出</p>
<p>又訊：財政經濟補充方案公佈後，棉紗市塲，仍擬恢復交易，但經兩月來之停閉，批發商存貨多已絡續出售，目前所存極少。據該公會某負責人稱：紗商本身，對市塲之能否恢復，不能主動，蓋除法令必須容許以外，棉紗必須廠方供給，今日因補充方案中，對棉紗恢復自由交易，尙無規定，故該會將俟市商會召集各業會議商討後，再向有關當局請求。</p>
<p>又訊：棉花交易，向無市塲集合交易，過去棉商與紗廠交易及同業買賣，均由掮客掇合。惟自限價以來，來源斷絕，交易無甚做開，同業執貨不售。茲以財經補充辦法公佈後，國棉聯購，原定以紗易棉辦法亦將有所變更，棉商爲維持業務生存計，亦擬俟聯購會核定各地收花價格後，遂步恢復交易。</p>
<h3>茶市買氣濃郁</h3>
<p>自行政院寬放限價，實行議價之命令傳滬後，紅綠茶花色，終受存底將罄之影響，供應依然趦趄，故買氣雖仍濃郁，猶難如願，交易續居停頓，市氣俏俐更甚，默察前途，絢爛可期。</p>
<h3>食糖尚未做開</h3>
<p>食糖市况，昨日公會尙無動態，因食糖一類議價，須中央核定，市塲能否恢復，尙須靜看各業趨勢，業中人多擬請求恢復市塲交易，但尙未有任何討論。</p>
<h3>五洋交易仍停頓</h3>
<p>五洋業公會附設之捲烟市塲，日前奉令暫停交換後，塲內交易停頓。今行政院改善經管補充辦法公佈後，柴米小菜等雖已恢復自由買賣，但日用品價格須由公會議定呈核，在未呈請核准以前，交易仍在停頓中，現公會正辦理手續中，一俟核定後，公會卽可恢復交易。</p>
<h3>中信局本週配售人造絲</h3>
<p>中央信託局向意大利易貨輸入之人造絲，最近先後運來二批，第一批共有九百箱，業已運抵來滬，刻正在辦理入口手續中。第二批共有二千餘箱，將於明日運到。上週該局應配與絲織業第八十九期之人造絲，因故停配。本週內決定恢復配售。</p>

<h3>平津各校復課　欠薪麵粉均已領發</h3>
<p>〔本報南京一日電〕平津各校因物價日益上漲，員生九十兩月麵粉迄未如期配發，食糧最受壓迫，不得已乃相率停課。聞現在各校當局，除一面先行籌款墊發敎職員十一等月份薪俸外，關於糧食問題，敎部前三日與糧食部作懇切談話後，糧食部已電令平津糧食機構速配各校員生積欠麵粉。頃悉敎部關係方面一日接平津校方長途電話，據云各校近已領到麵粉，皆已復課。</p>

<h3>美國大選前奏曲（八）　一個預測</h3>
<p>— 本報特派員</p>
<p>從共黨十二金剛　說到杜魯門換防</p>
<p>〔本報紐約十月廿四日航訊〕今年度的美國大選，比往常唯一不同的特色，便是刮去了美國共產黨。往常，美國共產黨的主席福斯特，經常被列入紐約州的總統候選人的選舉票裏，儘管選舉福斯特的人，很少很少，但在一個自由主義的國度裏邊，政黨自由競選，是憲法保障之下公民應有的權利。然而，今年的情形有了變動，自從國際間諜案洩露以後，美國的司法當局認爲美國共產黨有用暴力意圖推翻現政府的設據，所以，在夏秋之交，先後逮捕了美國共產黨的十二名大將，內中包括共產黨主席，各部會負責人，婦女運動主腦，乃至於各大城市工人運動的炘動者。其中有若干名是自動到「聯邦調査局」自首的，大半則是由秘密警察逮捕的。</p>
<p>華萊士的新舖子</p>
<p>當然，目前的情形，並不像過去那樣簡單，美蘇關係的惡化，是共產黨失去自由活動的主因。在美國國內，曾經有人要求暫時釋放福斯特及其同伴，讓他們參加十一月二日的競選，等到競選完畢以後，法院再請他們「回籠」，這是顧到理論和事實的折衷兩全的辦法。但是，最高法院考慮的結果，這一個彈性的折衷辦法終於被拒絕了。選舉票上，已經沃定不寫上共產黨候選人的名字，而且在大選前從的十一月初旬，共產黨的「十二金剛」，要正式以「叛國罪」公開審判。</p>
<p>就因爲這些緣故，大量的美國「準共產黨」，「半共產黨」，都湧進了華萊士的新開舖子。華萊士從「同情」黑人猶太人，索性住到黑人猶太人的家裏去了。從前，華萊士還說：「如果我當大總統，美蘇關係不會如此壞，』『有什麽困難，只要我跟史太林一談，便有辦法。」如今乾脆無條件接受了史太林，現在華棄士的公式是：凡是蘇聯的一定都對，凡是美蘇邦交上的磨擦，一定是美國執政者的過失。</p>
<p>巴歇爾白螞蟻</p>
<p>中西部競選旅行歸來以後，華萊士駡杜魯門是一倘「大傀儡」。他說。自從杜魯門開除了「新經濟派」（卽羅斯福時代的左派）以後，杜魯門已經實際上等於退位了。總統大權，旁落於華爾街的豪門和軍關之手，杜魯門無異虛設。華萊士把馬歇爾，駡成自螞蟻，他說；馬歇爾基奪國務院，增之乎白螞蟻盤據客堂上的棟樑，久而久之，非把棟樑蛀爛，大厦傾覆不可。華萊士還說：馬歇爾從巴黎聯合國大會期間，匆匆飛回來一轉，名義上是晋謁總統，實際上，跟杜魯門談不到幾分鐘，馬歇爾的大部份時間，是和國防部長福勒斯特，以及大大小小的軍閥，高量販賣戰爭。</p>
<p>「文生事件」以後</p>
<p>萊士還說：如果杜魯門要立志自救，唯一辦法，是把馬歇爾免職。實際上，自從所謂「文生事件」以後，杜魯門心目中，紫然有幾分討厭馬歇爾，馬歇爾在巴黎，覺得他的老闆在後面「拆橋」，一定跟前年的貝爾納斯一樣，在巴黎滿肚子牢騷。馬歇爾回華盛頓一趟，杜魯門宣佈撤銷「文生使蘇」的意見以後，事情大體算吿了一個段落。不料十多天以後，這位總統先生，又在　阿密海濱大放厥詞了：「就我的想法，派文生到莫斯科，和史太林直接談判，未嘗不是求取和平最好的辦法」！馬歇爾遠在巴黎，聽了這些，一定要急得「上吊」的罷！</p>
<p>杜魯門勢在必去</p>
<p>杜馬相左，並不代表外交政策的矛盾，而是代表美國現政權的凌亂與無能。杜魯門在邁阿密二次放了大砲以後，銷數最大的紐約『每日新聞』的社論寫道：「杜魯門先生，我們請求你，請求你不再亂發表意見，你雖然無用無能，但你畢竟是一個世界領導國家的大總統。……你再不要講那些密蘇里鄉下佬的蠢話，隨時隨地要想到你身爲一個最富强國家的總統」！</p>
<p>杜魯門勢在必去，大槪是不會有問題了。紐約時報的競選預測專家估計：全美四十八州的「複選單位」五百三十一票之中，（卽「總統選舉人」的票子）共和黨的杜威，可能得到三百三十四票。不管這個預測，是否精確，民主黨十六年的白宮生涯，很顯然的這回該輪到「換防」的時候了！（全文完）</p>
<h3>吳興絲綢業不振　應注意兩大病根</h3>
<p>〔本報杭州廿八日訊〕記者抵吳興後，考察了常地的絲綢業，各情已詳昨報。關於吳興的絲綢業爲何如此不振的問題，地方上的人們曾提了很多理由，但歸根結蒂，不外染色與守舊兩大病根，因爲吳興染色不考究，凡有色的綢子都要變色，所以大家不來問津，但如都如達昌那樣由上海運來色絲製迭，可說沒有這麼火的資本。而上海的綢廠，洞燭到吳興的隱處，於是自己製造色綢，自較把色絲運來吳興織造便捷得多，其實，染色不老究也是守舊之一種，如果我們專門羅致專家，研究染色的工作，那裏有染不好色的。同時，織造的花樣，土絲的改成廠絲，在在都要加以研究改良，才有出路。吳興的綢織業默守成規，仍自以中國「絲綢之家」自居，而不硏究衰落的原因，這實在是可憾的事。</p>
<p>再，像吳興這樣產絲綢的地方，應該特別把絲綢一項强調起來，加多硏究的機構。可是吳興除了有一個省辦的蠶桑學校外，竟找不着一個硏究綢織的學校。在吳興唯一的綢業子弟小學內，所授課程，與一般的小學毫無兩樣之處。記者以爲應設置一所綢織　　，爲中等學校的性質，專門研究織綢的改良，進而求取整個吳興綢織業的改革。（本報特派員儲裕生）</p>

<h3>淒冷西安秋</h3>
<p>— 本報記者　張僊洲</p>
<p>〔本報西安十月廿七日航訊〕西北的八月，是夏尾秋初，靑天白雲，寒葉大漠，時光給人安排了一個高爽的季節。「八一九」經濟改革方案公吿之後，古城的確是熟閙了一陣子，長夏苦雨，人們都希望着宜人秋色，好長舒一口悶氣，但是流年如水，誰又想到時隔兩月，已往的熱閙塲面竟已變成眼前的一片凄冷景况了。來日方長，如果不早一點設法，誰又想到他的後果會壞到什麼地步？</p>
<p>西安的貨價是向上海看齊，上海漲了，這裏當然要漲，上海買不出貨，西安當然也買不出貨·向上海看齊，如此而已。</p>
<p>十月初，西安市面上的怪象百出，許多大商店的滿架貨物，會在一夜絕跡，城門口是奉令嚴禁物資出走，然而市內的商店也不見東西。</p>
<p>市府當局不再忍耐了，尤其是搶購風潮發生後，各方責難紛紛，王市長和西安嚴司令曹日暉，一方面令軍警挨家，催促商號閑門應市，一方面令突擊隊四出突擊囤戶，而王曹兩氏也親坐車子到中心市區出巡，嚴査套購之黄牛黨，而演出了當街「打屁股」與「化妝游行」的趣劇。</p>
<p>商號開門了，只買了一天，家家空極，無貨可售，直到今天，百貨店天天開門，却仍無業可奮。</p>
<p>陜西省當局在陝東大戰的前夕，派了陳固亭·史直·張丹屛三位委員，到匪區連界的封鎖綫上去視察了一次。他們所得的結果，是豐碩而公正的。張委員在記者招待會中，坦白的承認了物資外漏的嚴重現象。他說據他調査所得的結果，奸商與共匪勾結，當時每兩黄金，運往共區，可換二十四兩烟土，一來一往，有四倍的厚利，所以爲亡命之徒所熱中。談到偷運過境的辦法大約有兩種，一種是從小路越過封鎖綫，一種是集體的武裝强行，與匪軍的軍事行動相配合。那些土匪大多是騎馬挾槍，趁匪方突破國軍某一據點之際全綫緊張，他們就鎮際衝過。</p>
<p>一塲愁雨，數次秋會，用物價的倍數算，今年西安的菊花是最便宜的，聽說就是那樣便宜，也遠難說手。</p>

<h3>American Ships Loaded with Military Supplies to Arrive in China Within Two Weeks; Over One Hundred Million US Dollars in Military Aid Funds Already Allocated</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 31st (Associated Press)] It is learned that the first batch of "substantial" American military supplies to aid the Chinese government will be rushed to China within two weeks. This batch of military supplies was originally scheduled to be shipped by chartered vessels in December, but now will be transported by army and navy vessels, thus avoiding the impact of the West Coast shipping strike. At the same time, a State Department spokesman stated that the US government has already allocated $100.5 million in military aid funds to the Chinese government, which is 85% of the $125 million allocated by Congress to aid China in suppressing the communists. According to the State Department's last report on the aid situation, issued on October 11, it was stated that $88,275,000 had already been handed over to the Chinese government. The person announcing the above news declined to specify the nature of this "substantial" batch of military supplies, only stating that it is currently being handled by the Army Ordnance Department, which likely means that it includes various guns, ammunition, tanks, and military vehicles. If there are any aircraft in this batch of military supplies, it is believed that the US Air Force will be responsible for shipping them. The news of the military supplies being shipped to China coincides with gloomy news from Nanjing. A senior Chinese official here admitted that the situation is quite serious, but he stated that the various speculations circulating are far from the truth. Currently, the Congressional Committee overseeing foreign aid is closely monitoring the situation in China. Recently, the committee announced the appointment of former US Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Bullitt, as a special envoy to China to investigate the country's situation in order to make recommendations to Congress. Bullitt recently severed political ties with Truman. He is scheduled to depart for China on the 9th of this month. Both Bullitt and the committee chairman, Bridges, are well-known figures who advocate providing more military aid to China. After the announcement of Bullitt's mission to China, it is widely believed that if Dewey is elected president, the US government's policy towards China will quickly change. According to the current procedure, China must use the funds allocated to it by the US State Department to purchase the military supplies it needs. The State Department cannot participate in the procurement of military supplies, but the US military authorities can assist in procurement at the request of the Chinese side. It is learned that the Army has already obtained the military supplies it is waiting to ship to China.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 31st] The US State Department announced tonight that to date, out of the $125 million in military aid funds for China, $100.5 million has now been allocated to the US Army, Navy, and Air Force to purchase weapons, ammunition, and other military equipment to be delivered to China. A State Department spokesman stated that the State Department had reported to President Truman on October 7 that $8.5 million had already been allocated to China in the aid to China plan, but since that time, the Chinese government had increased its orders for weapons, ammunition, and other war materials. He stated that the State Department does not yet know how much of this amount is for the use of the Chinese Army, Navy, and Air Force, but all of these new orders were placed by the Chinese government with the purchasers before the recent military developments in the Northeast. The spokesman pointed out that the State Department expects to announce in one day the allocation of another several million dollars in aid funds to the Chinese government.</p>
<h3>Reorganization of the US Advisory Group in China; Joint Military Advisory Group; He Yingqin and Barr Travel to Shanghai for Inspection</h3>
<p>[US Information Service, Washington, 1st] The US Secretary of Defense announced on the 1st that, effective November 1, 1948, the United States will establish a Joint US Military Advisory Group in China.</p>
<p>This Joint Military Advisory Group will replace the current Military Advisory Group (including Air Force, Ground Forces, and Combined Forces) and the Naval Advisory Group Investigation Committee. The US Joint Military Advisory Group in China will include an Army Advisory Group, an Air Force Advisory Group, a Naval Advisory Group, and a Combined Forces Advisory Group. Each group will be managed by a Director, assisted by one or more Deputy Directors and staff. Major General Barr, Brigadier General Thomas, Rear Admiral Oldendorf, and Colonel Daley will continue to serve as Directors of the Army Advisory Group, Air Force Advisory Group, Naval Advisory Group, and Combined Forces Advisory Group, respectively. The Joint Chiefs of Staff in Washington have designated Major General Barr as the Commander of the US Joint Military Advisory Group in China. The mission of the US Joint Military Advisory Group in China remains the same as that of the Military Advisory Group.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, this city] According to sources here, Minister of National Defense He Yingqin and US Military Advisory Group Commander Barr are scheduled to arrive in Shanghai by special plane from Nanjing on the 2nd to inspect relevant military agencies.</p>
<h3>Total Expenditure of the Economic Cooperation Administration in Aid to China Reaches Over One Hundred Million US Dollars</h3>
<p>[US Information Service, Washington, 31st] In the week ending October 27, the total amount of expenditures passed by the Economic Cooperation Administration for China totaled $110,968,381, plus the newly approved amount of $3.5 million announced on Friday.</p>
<h3>New York Times Editorial Comments on the Loss of Shenyang</h3>
<p>Zhang Criticizes the US Government's Policy Errors</p>
<p>[Associated Press, New York, 1st] A New York Times editorial on the 1st, commenting on the fall of Shenyang, stated: "Although Europe must still occupy a priority position in defending against communism, we must not ignore the crisis of Red Asia to the world."</p>
<p>The newspaper stated: "China, due to its industrial backwardness and the extensive destruction during the War of Resistance, must rely heavily on foreign aid in its fight against the Communist Party. The fall of Shenyang not only caused China to lose the rich Northeast provinces, but also illustrated the following fact: this vast and wealthy region was seized from the Japanese, intended to be returned to China, but is now being taken away by the Soviet Fifth Column in a manner similar to the Japanese conquest of the Northeast."</p>
<p>After mentioning China's difficulties and urgent need for assistance, the newspaper continued: "The United States, which once caused difficulties for China with its silver policy and acquiesced in the Soviet Union's expansion of power in the Northeast, has been hesitant to provide such assistance. Because, contrary to the US European policy, the United States does not have a two-ocean policy of aiding China at the same time. The administration initially hoped to bring the Chinese Communist Party into the Chinese government, then canceled the already approved loans, and imposed an arms embargo on China. Under Republican pressure, this policy began to change, but the military aid passed by Congress in April has not yet had a single item arrive in China."</p>
<p>The newspaper stated: "All previous dire warnings about the impending collapse of the Chinese government have been safely overcome due to China's strength. "We still hope that China's tenacity will be able to overcome all difficulties again."</p>

<h3>Battle for the Suburbs of Taiyuan Resumes; Reinforcements to Shanxi Advancing</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Xi'an, 1st] The Air Force at the Xi'an base dispatched aircraft last night and today to bomb the bandits on the outskirts of Taiyuan.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Taiyuan, 1st] The battle for the mountainous area east of Taiyuan has reached its climax again. From 4:00 PM on the 31st, the bandits gathered the remnants of the 3rd, 8th, and 13th columns, and launched a fourth all-out offensive towards the mountainous area east of the city, with fierce fighting throughout the night. The battle was fierce, with the focus on the mountain 15 li southeast of the city, the Naoma 10 li east of the city, Xiaoyaotou 15 li east, Simuge, Pangcheng, Niutuo 15 li northeast, and Xialing, especially the bloody battles at Xiaoyaotou and Niutuo. After our defending troops bravely resisted with combined infantry and artillery, they finally repelled more than 20 waves of the bandits' charge. Failing in their fierce attack, the bandits released a large amount of tear gas in the mountains and other places. Fortunately, our army was well-prepared, and only a few dozen people were poisoned. In the fierce fighting until the morning of the 1st, it is estimated that we killed and wounded more than 5,000 bandits, with bodies piled up in front of our positions. Currently, the national army is still firmly defending its positions and annihilating the stubborn bandits.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Beiping, 1st] The national army reinforcements to Shanxi have been advancing rapidly in recent days with the force of a bamboo splitting.

<h3>Brilliant Results Achieved on the Eastern Section of the Ping-Sui Railway</h3>
<p>Bandit Zhan Danan's Chief of Staff Killed</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Zhangjiakou, 1st] Our armored train team on the eastern section of the Ping-Sui Railway severely damaged the bandit forces, achieving brilliant results. At 1:00 AM on the 1st, over 1,000 bandits from the Independent 7th Division, escorting over 600 pack animals loaded with cotton clothing, were transporting them north from Taipingbao, east of Shacheng. Our armored train team happened to pass by and, in coordination with the national army, launched a pincer attack. After about four hours of fierce fighting, bandit corpses littered the ground, and they fled west. The national army is still pursuing and annihilating them.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Beiping, 1st] A unit of the national army's mopping-up force launched a fierce pursuit of the bandit Independent 7th Division between Shacheng and Tuben on the eastern section of the Ping-Sui Railway on the 1st.

<h3>Bandit Troops in the Jing and Wei River Valleys of Shaanxi Attempting to Stir Up Trouble</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Xi'an, 1st] The Dong Chechen unit of the Communist bandit's Xifu Column has recently been active in Yongshou, Linyou, Qishan, and other places in the Jing and Wei River Valleys.

<h3>Although the Northeast Has Suffered a Setback, the Overall Situation is Not in Danger; The President Explains at the KMT Central Political Committee Meeting</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 1st] The Kuomintang Central Political Committee meeting was held on the morning of the 1st. During the meeting, President Chiang explained the situation in the Northeast, frankly stating the process of the fighting and the reasons for the failure. He also stated that although the Northeast war has suffered a setback, it is still difficult for the main force of the Communist bandits to directly threaten the situation in North China. Furthermore, Commander Fu's fighting spirit and strategic application are both extremely brave and well-prepared. The Supreme Command has also made timely deployments to strengthen combat power, so the overall situation must be safe. We should accept the lessons of failure, strengthen our confidence, remedy our shortcomings, and make improvements in all aspects in order to reverse this serious setback and stabilize the overall situation. Then, Premier Weng reported on the meeting of the Executive Yuan, and the committee members believed that the supplementary measures to the emergency measures for finance and economy were very necessary as a temporary solution, and hoped that the authorities would quickly plan and decide on a fundamental solution to seek fundamental economic stability.</p>
<h3>Legislative Yuan Finance and Economics Committee Subcommittee Meeting; Discusses Stabilizing People's Livelihood Plan; The Government Should Grasp Important Materials to Maintain Currency Value</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 1st] The nine-member subcommittee previously appointed by the Legislative Yuan Finance and Economics Committee to draft a plan to stabilize the currency system and stabilize people's livelihood held its first meeting on the morning of the 1st. Chairman Huang Yuanbin, Deputy Minister of Finance Xu Baiwei, Advisor Zang Qifang, Deputy Minister of Industry and Commerce Zhang Zizhu, and Director of the Control Department Fei Mingyang were all present. First, Xu Baiyuan explained the reasons for the change in the price limit policy in the supplementary measures for economic management announced on the 31st, briefly stating that the failure of the price limit policy was due to the abundance of floating capital and the uneven implementation results in various regions, which affected the circulation of materials, leading to the disappearance of goods from the market and the skyrocketing of black market prices, creating the recent serious economic situation. In order to take care of people's livelihood and stabilize society, the government made the decision to implement supplementary measures. However, the announcement on the 31st is only a part of the entire set of supplementary measures for financial and economic reform. The rest of the set of measures will be determined by major policies and will continue to be announced and implemented in the short term to eliminate the current financial and economic crisis. Xu stated that regarding the implementation of adjusting the treatment of public education personnel, the Executive Yuan will listen to the opinions of the Legislative Yuan after the Public Officials' Salary Law completes the legislative process, and formulate specific measures based on the principles of the supplementary measures. After Xu's report, Bao Huaguo and others first raised questions about the technical and standard issues of price determination for daily necessities and industrial raw materials. After Zhang Zizhu answered them one by one, they began a wide-ranging discussion. Finally, Huang Yuanbin, Lu Yuwen, Wu Gan, Wang Menglin, Bao Huaguo, and others were approved to organize the opinions of the committee members and draft a preliminary plan. Summarizing the key points of the speeches of the committee members, it was generally agreed that the four contents of the supplementary measures for economic management announced on the 31st were too empty, and the government lacked sufficient preparation for the implementation of various principles, which was not enough to cope with the current financial and economic crisis. Therefore, it is still necessary for the Legislative Yuan to research and propose a plan. Regarding finance, the committee members believed that it is essential to effectively save expenditures and raise revenue to tighten issuance. Regarding finance, some advocated opening up foreign exchange and free trading, and controlling material management of import and export trade, while others advocated that all foreign exchange operations should be managed by the government to prevent national wealth from being obtained by a few special interest groups. Most committee members unanimously believed that issuing hard currency is a powerful measure to stabilize currency value. Regarding the control of prices, the committee members all pointed out that the government must grasp several important materials, such as fuel and food, to maintain the purchasing power of the gold yuan and use them as standards for other prices. The pricing of prices must be reasonable and should be done through the organization of trade associations, acknowledging the legitimate profits of merchants and maintaining the balance of the national market. The committee members were all extremely concerned about the current situation, and they reasoned and planned based on academic theory and reality, speaking enthusiastically until the meeting adjourned at noon.</p>
<h3>Coal Shortage in the Nanjing-Shanghai Area is Severe</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 1st] The coal shortage in the Nanjing-Shanghai area has reached a severe stage. After the establishment of the Coal Adjustment Committee, the responsible parties have begun to plan ways to solve the coal shortage. According to authoritative sources, the current coal shortage is not due to a lack of coal sources, but due to the inability to control transportation. The responsible authorities are actively consulting with the Ministry of National Defense and will request the Ministry of National Defense to order the local garrisons not to detain coal transport vehicles and ships.</p>
<h3>Fighting Still Occurring Around Shenyang; Last Plane Flying from Beiping to Shenyang Evacuates Four People</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 1st] Military news: There was still fighting around Shenyang yesterday, but it was not very intense. Over 1,000 bandits each were sneaking around the Dadaying in eastern Shenyang and the Beiling near northern Shenyang. Our army is currently blocking them. The Hunhe Airport (southeast of Shenyang) is still intact and usable. The entire urban area is still under the control of the national army. Fierce fighting occurred near Xinmin on the 31st. The bandits concentrated the main forces of the 1st, 3rd, 8th, and 10th columns and fought a bloody battle with a certain unit of our national army. Our army killed and wounded over 2,000 bandits in the Yaogaotaizi area and destroyed six bandit guns. Having accomplished the task of annihilating the bandits, they have safely transferred to the designated area. In the Liaonan area, our army has driven back the bandits on both sides of the Dashiqiao-Haicheng section of the China Changchun Railway. The situation in Yingkou is as calm as ever.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 31st] China News Agency: At noon on the 31st, a plane flew from Beiping to Shenyang to pick up relevant personnel from Shenyang. Because the situation at Hunhe Airport was dangerous, it circled for a long time at an altitude of a thousand feet before forcibly landing. Before it could stay for a moment, a shell grazed the fuselage. The pilot immediately took off, and four people were evacuated with the plane. This was the last plane to leave Shenyang.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Tianjin, 1st] It is learned that air transport between here and Shenyang was interrupted on the 31st. Since the 31st, no more civil aviation planes have traveled back and forth.</p>
<h3>Full Text of New Regulations on Trade with Japan for Merchants: Awaiting Comments from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs Before Final Approval</h3>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Watching Today's US Presidential Election</h3>
<p>The US presidential election, which attracts global attention, began today. All 95 million voters nationwide will cast their sacred votes, choosing between Dewey and Truman. How the voting will result, on the eve of the vote, we cannot make any rash pronouncements, and both sides have the confidence to win. For example, Truman stated in his hometown, "The Democratic Party will definitely win this election!" Dewey declared in New York, "The eve of victory has arrived!" However, according to opinion polls conducted by various sectors in the United States, Dewey is expected to be the most likely to be elected president, and even if we judge with common sense, we believe Dewey's victory is more certain. Therefore, this US presidential election has a very significant impact on US domestic and foreign policy and even the world situation, and it is indeed worthy of our attention.</p>
<p>Since the late President Roosevelt of the Democratic Party entered the White House in 1933 and implemented the New Deal, the Democratic Party has held power for nearly sixteen years. Its achievements for the United States and the world are forever indelible in the hearts of the American people, not only saving the US economic crisis but also eliminating the threat to the American way of life. Logically, the Democratic Party's victory is not a problem. However, the domestic and international situation after the end of the war was not always satisfactory. The urgency of the post-war world crisis increased the United States' sense of responsibility to the world, and President Truman's foreign policy inevitably wavered. Neither the "Truman Doctrine" touted by President Truman nor the "Foreign Aid Plan" presided over by Secretary of State Marshall was universally and thoroughly implemented, so that the United States retreated step by step and fell behind in the "Cold War," especially in Asia, where not only Southeast Asia has felt the threat of communism, but Northeast Asia will also fall into the hands of the Communist International. The policy toward China has created a historic mistake, causing the Democratic Party to lose the confidence of the American people. Coupled with the internal crisis in the United States, especially the shadow of economic panic, casts a shadow over everyone's heart, thus creating a sense of weariness and disappointment among the American people towards the Democratic Party. Weariness and disappointment led to a "change of heart," giving the Republican Party an opportunity to make a comeback. In fact, Dewey's hope of winning lies here.</p>
<p>In terms of the essence of the Democratic Party and the Republican Party, there is not much difference at all. General constitutional scholars criticize the two major parties in the United States, saying: "The Democratic and Republican parties are like two wine bottles with different labels. On the surface, they look like two kinds of wine with completely different properties, but when you open the bottles, they are empty." According to this, we do not need to have excessive expectations for the change of the White House host from Truman of the Democratic Party to Dewey of the Republican Party; in any case, the US national policy will not have major changes in principle. However, when implementing national policy, the change of the two parties will inevitably have different priorities, especially Marshall's "Europe first, Asia later" foreign aid policy. Whether Dewey will inherit the mantle is a question. According to reports, Dewey has criticized the Democratic Party's policy toward China, saying: "The Truman government not only lacks a policy to promote peace, but instead helps the Soviet Union to invade the world everywhere; in the Far East, the United States does not hesitate to sacrifice China and compromise with Stalin, allowing him to control northeastern China." Mr. Bullitt was soon ordered to come to China to conduct an on-the-spot investigation of the political situation in China, and will inform Dewey of what he has seen and heard at any time. Therefore, we expect that after Dewey is elected president, at a minimum, the US policy toward China will definitely be changed.</p>
<p>However, according to US constitutional practice, the new president will not be able to take office at the White House until January 20 next year. From November to January 20 next year, it can be said to be a "vacuum" period in American politics. In today's world, where the global pressure is low and people are uneasy, we cannot help but feel anxious and fearful about the two-month US "political vacuum" period. Although some people have suggested that if the election is revealed, once Dewey is elected, Dewey should immediately issue a declaration and announce the policies of the new government in advance, it is doubtful what kind of stabilizing power this declaration has. We believe that the only way to solve the problem now is to appeal to the sense of responsibility of the Truman government in the face of the critical situation. If we can imitate Roosevelt's election as president, the former President Hoover, before handing over the office, took the lead in soliciting Roosevelt's political views on major events. In these two months, President Truman can fully understand that the serious situation today has made the United States unable to go beyond the constitutional norms and immediately implement the new policies announced by the next president to fill this "political vacuum," it will be of great benefit to the United States and the world.</p>
<h3>Price Limits Lifted, Market Still Deserted: New Prices Being Negotiated Everywhere; Food and Vegetable Prices Rise Several Times</h3>
<p>Nanjing [Report from Our Office, 1st] After the Executive Yuan passed the supplementary measures for economic control on the 31st, the reaction of the Nanjing market on the 1st seemed still very sluggish. As the shops did not receive instructions from the government, they still stopped doing business all day on the 1st, the same as the previous day. The Wuyang Market was the same. Only the small vegetable market was slightly different. Eggs, which were not seen in the past, were already on the market, selling for 3 jiao each, six times higher than the price limit. However, pork was still in short supply. It is generally believed that the market will not return to its old state until two or three days later.</p>
<p>Wuxi [Report from Our Office, 1st] Although various industries opened as usual on the morning of the 1st, there was even more intense panic buying, especially among young people from other provinces who rushed to buy rubber products. Although the military and police were dispatched to maintain order, it was not effective. At 3 pm, the County Chamber of Commerce convened a temporary meeting. Various industries reported the suffering of being panic bought, requesting relief. It was decided to suspend business for two days from the 2nd to sort out the inventory. Industries discussing price negotiations included oil, cotton yarn, cloth, kerosene, southern goods, candy, paint, cigarettes, department stores, flour, etc. The sale of rice and grain at fixed prices was also temporarily suspended. It was scheduled to be sold universally after the prices were negotiated on the 3rd. It is said that the market price has increased by about two times.</p>
<p>Suzhou [Report from Our Office, 1st] After learning that the price limit was lifted and free trading was restored in this county, the county government convened an emergency meeting of grain merchants and heads of various agencies on the morning of the 1st. As a result of the discussion, the purchase of flour was stopped, and the supply of rice, oil, etc. to the market was immediately restored. However, the market side suspended transactions due to insufficient sources.</p>
<p>Changshu [Report from Our Office, 1st] After the announcement of the supplementary measures for economic control, the business community here was quite interested. On the 1st, the market prices of various goods rose sharply. The county authorities convened an emergency meeting to discuss and resolve various technical issues of price negotiation. It was decided that the prices of yarn, cloth, sugar, coal, and salt should be determined by the central competent authorities, while the prices of other important daily necessities should be negotiated by the industries themselves and reported to the county for approval. From the 2nd, various industries will resume normal business. If there are any special accidents, the county will take measures to prevent them. All checkpoints will be abolished.</p>
<p>Jiangyin [Report from Our Office, 1st] With the announcement of the supplementary measures for economic control, the market situation in Cheng County is stable. How to proceed will depend on the situation in Wuxi. The shops in various industries have been emptied due to the panic buying in October, and are virtually closed down. They are unable to pay business tax. On the 1st, the County Chamber of Commerce sent a telegram to the Department of Finance, requesting exemption to alleviate the business difficulties.</p>
<p>Nantong [Report from Our Office, 1st] The supplementary plan for financial and economic reform was disclosed in the newspapers today, and the market is even more chaotic. The panic buying of silk fabrics and Wuyang goods is extremely crowded. Fortunately, the distribution of rice has been distributed, and the order is still good.</p>
<p>Yangzhou [Report from Our Office, 1st] The County Material Adjustment Committee was formally established on the 31st. County Magistrate Wang concurrently serves as the chairman, and the vice-chairmen are appointed by the Speaker of the Senate and the Chairman of the Chamber of Commerce.</p>
<p>Zhenjiang [Report from Our Office, 1st] After the price limit was lifted, the Provincial Capital convened a temporary meeting on the afternoon of the 1st at the Chamber of Commerce to adjust prices and stabilize social order. It was decided that the prices of major daily necessities would be reviewed by the Department of Social Affairs on the 2nd, and sent to the Provincial Price Review Committee through the county for approval and implementation.</p>
<p>Hangzhou [Report from Our Office, 1st] After receiving the supplementary measures for economic control from the Zhejiang Provincial Government, it convened an emergency meeting on the 1st and decided that various counties and cities would implement price negotiations for various daily necessities and send urgent telegrams to the entire province for implementation. (Another Telegram) The 1st is the Merchant's Day, and most shops in Hangzhou are closed. After the price limit was lifted, only cigarettes fell slightly. The City Chamber of Commerce convened a temporary meeting to discuss how to determine prices after the price limit was lifted, to support government laws and regulations, and to persuade various industries not to take the opportunity to raise prices wildly and stimulate public sentiment. The grain market is scheduled to formally resume trading on the 2nd. The new prices are set at 86 yuan for high-grade, 82 yuan for medium-grade, and 78 yuan for low-grade.</p>
<p>Wuhu [Report from Our Office, 1st] Today, the shelves of silk fabric, department store, and Wuyang stores in Wuhu are still empty. Rice has been supplied, at 40 yuan per stone. Due to someone preventing purchases outside the suburbs, firewood and charcoal are still out of stock. The vegetable market has fish and meat, which are one to two times higher than the original price limit.</p>
<p>Bengbu [Report from Our Office, 1st] The grain market is already free to trade, but the grain source is still scarce due to the continuous purchase by scalpers along the river. Rice is even more difficult to obtain, and briquettes are also being snapped up.</p>
<p>Nanchang [Report from Our Office, 1st] From the 2nd, Nanchang prices will be decontrolled in accordance with the supplementary measures for economic reform of the Executive Yuan. Yesterday was the last day for exchanging gold, silver, and foreign currencies. The Central Bank only exchanged one silver dollar.</p>
<p>Guangzhou [Report from Our Office, 1st] The exchange of gold, silver, and foreign currencies here ended as scheduled on the 31st. However, there were very few people going to exchange on that day, and only one US dollar, 89 Hong Kong dollars, 65 silver dollars, and 10 Philippine pesos were exchanged. Market prices and black market foreign currencies rose madly, with a general increase of more than 30% in one day. The market turmoil is similar to that before the issuance of the Gold Yuan.</p>
<p>Hankou [Report from Our Office, 1st] After the price limit policy was changed, the market here did not show significant fluctuations in other prices except for the sharp rise in the price of discs used to make cigarettes.</p>
<p>Tianjin [Report from Central News Agency, 1st] After the announcement of the supplementary measures for financial and economic reform, the Tianjin market is looking forward to it. However, there is a big difference in psychology between the two sides, so transactions are quite sluggish. Grain prices have not changed much, and yarn, cloth, and groceries are firmer. Regarding the issue of setting prices for daily necessities by the local government, Hu Menghua, director of the Social Affairs Bureau, said: Based on past experience, it can be said with certainty that the stricter the control, the more unstable the situation. Especially under the current situation where the government cannot thoroughly control production and distribution, setting the price too low will inevitably lead to the disruption of material flow. Therefore, Tianjin's price-setting policy must be lenient in the future, and the economic situation may be slightly stabilized.</p>
<p>Qingdao [Report from Central News Agency, 1st] After the announcement of the supplementary measures for financial and economic reform, the Qingdao market has responded well. All brands of cloth and yarn have slightly rebounded, and the food market is active.</p>

<h3>Huang Chao-chin Talks About Adjusting the Taiwan Exchange Rate: Predicts Taiwan Prices Will Plunge; Taiwan Bank's Suspension of Receiving Remittances from Outside the Province Is Still Thoroughly Implemented</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Taipei Office, 1st] All sectors here are pleased with the adjustment of the Taiwan exchange rate. According to Huang Chao-chin, Speaker of the Provincial Senate: Taiwan's economic system is different from the mainland, and it has a huge production force. If it can be stabilized, this production force can be exerted to its maximum efficiency. Adjusting the Taiwan exchange rate to make it mobile is an important factor in stabilizing Taiwan. In the future, increased production will contribute to the country. He believes that the increase or decrease of the combined exchange rate is not enough to affect the value of the Gold Yuan. The general Taiwan compatriots feel the same way. If sacrificing Taiwan can protect the country, the Taiwan compatriots will be happy to sacrifice. However, if sacrificing Taiwan does not help the overall plan, it is better to preserve Taiwan. Huang also predicted that Taiwan prices will plunge in the shortest possible time.</p>
<p>[Report from Our Taipei Office, 1st] Qu Jingzhou, Deputy General Manager of the Bank of Taiwan, told reporters on the 1st: After the Taiwan exchange rate is adjusted, the previously established method of suspending the receipt of remittances from outside the province will still be thoroughly implemented. He explained the lack of cash on the market, saying: The current total amount of issuance is 64 billion yuan, and deposits are more than 30 billion yuan, which is only 10 million US dollars at the market price, which is only one-twentieth of the total amount of circulating funds during the Japanese occupation. The current population has increased and the business has expanded, which requires more than the Japanese occupation period. I feel that the chips are too thin, which proves that the combined currency will never inflate.</p>
<h3>Mobile Capital Along the Bengbu-Xuzhou Line Flows into Northern Anhui to Purchase Grain</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Zhengyangguan Office, 1st] A large amount of mobile capital along the Bengbu-Xuzhou Line has poured into the Zhengyangguan area of northern Anhui to purchase rice, wheat, and soybeans. Various goods here have been in extreme short supply recently.</p>

<h3>US Holds General Election Today, Dewey Likely to Ascend to the Presidential Throne, Truman Still Has Great Confidence, Both Parties' Presidential and Vice-Presidential Candidates Urge People to Vote</h3>
<p>[United Press International, Washington, 1st] Political polls unanimously indicate today that American voters will elect the first Republican president in twenty years tomorrow. Polling places will open at sunrise, and it is expected that between 47 and 50 million people will vote. However, it is feared that half of the eligible voters nationwide will forgo their right this time. It seems that the Republican Party will retain its majority in the House of Representatives, but the number of seats may be slightly reduced. As for the Senate, the outcome is still uncertain. The Republican advantage is questionable, and the Democratic Party has a chance to split the seats evenly with the Republican Party, each occupying 48 seats, or even surpassing them. Currently, the Republican Party has 51 seats, and the Democratic Party has 45 seats. Republican presidential and vice-presidential candidates Dewey and Warren will address the nation tonight on major broadcasting networks. Shortly thereafter, Democratic presidential and vice-presidential candidates Truman and Barkley will follow with their broadcasts. Traditionally, the last speech of each presidential candidate is not intended for campaigning but rather to urge voters to vote. Although this year will inevitably follow this precedent, this election campaign is one of the most fierce in modern history. In addition to electing a president tomorrow, 432 members of the House of Representatives, 32 senators, 32 governors, and tens of thousands of local officials will also be elected. Truman has returned to his hometown of Independence, Missouri, and will await the announcement of the election results there. Dewey has returned to his country residence in New York State and will enter the Republican headquarters in New York City in the afternoon to await good news.</p>
<p>[United Press International, New York, 31st] The presidential candidates will deliver optimistic final speeches tonight, ending the 1948 presidential campaign. New York Governor Dewey appears to have a strong grasp on victory. President Truman still hopes to win a large number of votes and overturn general expectations.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, St. Louis, 30th] Missouri political circles believe that since the beginning of the campaign, Truman's chances of being elected seem to have increased, but to defeat Dewey, a miracle would have to occur. Observers speculate that although Truman has tried his best to win the votes of 60 million workers, most workers will still vote for Dewey. Observers here stated: Truman will likely win in Missouri.</p>
<p>[United Press International, Washington, 1st] According to weather forecasts, the weather will be clear in most parts of the country on the 2nd, when the national election is held. A Democratic spokesman immediately stated: He firmly believes that clear weather will enable Truman to win more than 60 million votes and be elected to the White House. The Republican Party remains optimistic about its chances of winning.</p>
<h3>General Procedures for US Elections, the People First Elect Electors, Then the President, Congressmen, and Governors are Produced</h3>
<p>[United States Information Service, Washington, 1st] The US Electoral College does not directly vote to elect the president from among the candidates. In reality, people vote to elect "electors," who then elect the president from among the candidates in an electoral meeting. There are a total of 531 electoral votes, and a winning presidential candidate must obtain at least 266 of them. If any candidate fails to obtain the necessary number of votes, the election may be deadlocked. If this is the case, the president will be elected by the US House of Representatives.</p>
<p>This year, the Electoral College will not only elect the president and vice president but also 32 of the 96 members of the US Senate, 432 of the 435 members of the US House of Representatives, 32 of the 48 governors, and many state and city officials. Nationally, besides the presidential contest, the competition between the Democratic and Republican parties to control the Senate is attracting increasing attention. The Republican Party is currently the majority party. If one party can control either house of Congress, the chairman of that house and most of the seats and leading figures on the committees will belong to that party. If men and women citizens of the United States who have reached voting age still do not know the appearance, views, and public and private lives of the candidates, it is not the fault of the candidates or the US news media.</p>
<h3>Dewey Attends Church, Young Pastor Feels Nervous</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, New York, 31st, United Press] Dewey rested in his home in his hometown today and prayed to spend his weekend before the election peacefully. This morning, Dewey drove with his wife to Trinity Episcopal Church to attend service. Mrs. Dewey wore a red hat and a silver fox stole. The church can only accommodate 100 people, and there were 58 people attending the service this morning (including ten reporters covering the election news). The Deweys sat in the third row. The young pastor Wimmsley, who presided over the service, trembled when he read the prayers. The Deweys repeatedly knelt on the cushions to pray. After quietly listening to Pastor Wimmsley's sermon, the Deweys drove home. Mr. Dewey rested in the afternoon, temporarily putting the election aside.</p>
<h3>Moscow Newspaper Comments on US Elections</h3>
<p>No Difference Between the Democratic and Republican Parties</p>
<p>[United Press International, Moscow, 1st] Moscow newspapers unanimously believe that it makes little difference whether the Democratic or Republican Party wins the US presidential election on the 2nd. They believe that the competition between the Democratic and Republican parties is merely a competition between two parties controlled by highly financial groups and led by undemocratic leaders. They claim that when Truman and Dewey compete for the presidency, terrorist organizations will try to prevent millions of progressive citizens from going to vote.</p>
<h3>Japanese Hope Dewey Will Be Elected to Actively Help Japan Recover</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 1st, United Press] Japanese political and economic figures believe that after Dewey is elected, the Republican government will be more active than the Truman government in helping Japan complete its economic recovery. According to people close to the Yoshida cabinet, Yoshida believes that the Dewey government will be more supportive of adopting more conservative policies to guide Japan's economic reconstruction than some New Deal figures in the Allied General Headquarters. Japanese figures have noted the possibility that the Dewey government may help revise the Allied policy of dispersing Japanese industries, thereby accelerating Japan's economic recovery. Japanese newspapers have given great importance to the US election, publishing various reports before the election with prominent coverage.</p>
<h3>US Republican Diplomats Explore Concluding a Separate Peace Treaty with Japan, Future Policy Will Depend on the Evolution of the Situation in Asia</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, New York, 31st, United Press] Republican diplomatic experts are currently exploring the possibility of concluding a peace treaty with Japan, either with or without the Soviet Union. They emphasize that they are in the initial stages of research, and the final decision may be months away. At a time when Dewey has made repeated declarations in his campaign speeches but is unwilling to issue any clear policy statements, some senior Republican advisors expect that if the government does change as they expect, then peace with Japan will be made next year. Those who favor concluding a peace treaty with Japan regardless of whether the Soviet Union participates point out that the United States concluded a separate peace with Germany after World War I and refused to sign the Treaty of Versailles. These people believe that the United States expects Britain, the Netherlands, the Philippines, and France to also sign a peace treaty. There is some doubt as to whether China is still bound by the 1945 treaty with the Soviet Union that prohibits "separate peace." Senior Republicans have made it clear that the United States cannot take clear action in the Far East without studying the secret reports currently only available to the Democratic administration. They say that the two parties' foreign policy depends on obtaining supplementary secret intelligence and the future evolution of the overall situation in Asia.</p>
<h3>October Revolution Anniversary, Soviet Slogans Emphasize Increased Production</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Moscow, 1st] The slogans of the Soviet Communist Party commemorating the 31st anniversary of its October Revolution have been published in today's newspapers. Compared with the content of previous slogans, the focus remains on the production sector, with a total of 52 slogans. Forty-three of the slogans are designed to address this theme, namely, requiring people to strengthen efficiency, strengthen efforts to increase production, which is sufficient to indicate that while people around the world are feeling bewildered about the overall situation, the Soviet Union is still continuing its production movement. Only three slogans relate to world issues, namely, demanding that workers expose the ideas of warmongers and unite democratic forces in the struggle for peace and security.</p>
<h3>Opposition to Anglo-Chinese Proposal on Holy Land, Soviet Union to Use Veto, Egypt Says Jewish Forces in Negev Have Not Ceased Fire</h3>

<p>[Agence France-Presse, Cairo, 31st] Tonight, Egyptian Prime Minister Nuqrashi declared that the news circulating this morning that a ceasefire had been reached in Palestine was not credible, and that the fighting there was still intense. The Jews do not seem to be complying with the United Nations' order for a ceasefire in the area.</p>

<h3>Citywide Meeting of All Industries, Mayor and Speaker Deliver Earnest Admonitions, Price Adjustments Must Be Reasonable, Do Not Fail the Government's Hard Work, Two Provisional Motions Passed, Request Release of Arrested Merchants, Approve Import of Industrial Necessities with Own Foreign Exchange</h3>
<p>[Our Report] In order to discuss the issue of commodity prices in the city after the lifting of price controls, the Shanghai Industrial Association and the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce convened a meeting of members of all industries at the auditorium of the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce at 5:00 PM yesterday. Attending were Mayor Wu, Speaker Pan, Director Wu, Luo Qinghua, Du Yuesheng, Xu Xueyu, and the chairmen of various trade associations, totaling more than 400 people. The meeting was presided over by Chairman Xu Jilong and lasted for two hours before adjourning. Two provisional motions were passed during the meeting: (1) To send a telegram to all chambers of commerce nationwide, requesting the Central Government to release legitimate merchants who were detained under the Emergency Financial Measures Ordinance. (2) To request the Central Government to allow the import of industrial necessities with their own foreign exchange.</p>
<p>After Chairman Xu Jilong delivered a brief opening speech, Mayor Wu delivered a speech, stating in brief: Since the Central Government announced the lifting of price controls, the local government and the Bureau of Social Affairs had to engage in thorough discussions with the industrial and commercial sectors regarding future price issues. I believe that everyone should have a common understanding of the government at present. Over the past seventy-odd days, the government has repeatedly changed its economic policies, and its motives have all been to rescue the people. In order to quell the rebellion, inflation is inevitably unavoidable. When hyperinflation began in July and August of this year, causing the people to be unable to live and the industrial and commercial sectors to face severe difficulties, the government, in view of this, made the decision to reform the currency system and implement price controls. However, after price controls were implemented, factories were unable to resume production, materials were hoarded, and people's lives became even more difficult. Therefore, the government had no choice but to announce the lifting of price controls. Of course, economic problems should be solved with economic methods, and lifting price controls is still a way to solve them. However, what I worry about is that the past phenomenon was "money without goods," and in the future, it is feared that it will be "goods without money." Before today, everyone was deeply afraid of not having enough to eat or wear. After today, five million citizens are worried that prices will soar. In today's situation, I hope that the industrial and commercial sectors can act conscientiously and adjust commodity prices reasonably, without seeking exorbitant profits. I hope that all trade associations can strengthen their organizations and help the government overcome this difficult situation. I sincerely pray that the industrial and commercial sectors of Shanghai will take the lead in abiding by the law and become a model for the country.</p>
<h3>Considering the People's Purchasing Power</h3>
<p>Following the speech by Director Wu Kaixian of the Social Affairs Bureau, which briefly stated: The government's decision to lift price controls this time is purely to rescue the crisis of industry and commerce, because today industry and commerce have reached a critical juncture of survival. The most urgent and important issue at present is how to adjust the prices of finished products. I hope that all industries can consider one issue when determining prices—the purchasing power of the people. After several changes in Shanghai, the purchasing power of the citizens has indeed generally declined. Today, it has truly reached the point where the people are impoverished and their wealth is exhausted. You should also consider how to enable the poor to continue to live, because this is a factor in Shanghai's stability. The pricing of various industries must be reasonable. Those with high costs should have higher prices, but those whose raw materials are allocated by the government have very low costs, and the pricing should be reduced accordingly. Moreover, various industries have suffered losses in this buying spree, but to varying degrees. Taking the cotton cloth industry as an example, cloth shops were completely emptied by the buying spree and suffered heavy losses, but the losses of the factories were lighter, and the losses of wholesalers were even lighter. Furthermore, the losses of the woolen yarn industry were even slighter. Therefore, when determining new prices, various industries should consider the actual cost needs and strive for fairness and reasonableness.</p>
<h3>It is Essential to Be Reasonable and Not Arouse Citizen Resentment</h3>
<p>Following the speech by Speaker Pan, he stated: The so-called extraordinary period is not a period in which ordinary principles can be applied. After the announcement of the August 19th price control policy, I immediately went to Nanjing to present the matter to the President and Minister Wang, requesting the central government to trust the people. Any policy must succeed with the cooperation of the people. I hoped that the government would trust and utilize the chambers of commerce, but unfortunately, it was not adopted at the time. Now, it is no longer a matter of reviewing and settling past responsibilities. The current focus should be on how to control prices in the future. From today onwards, it will depend on the chambers of commerce and trade associations themselves. Because in the past, we had reasons to shirk responsibility, but now that the government has trusted us, if we still fail, then we will suffer the consequences and deserve to die. If the trade associations do not exercise their conscience at this time and seek exorbitant profits, then in another month, the people will forget the suffering of price controls and complain about the soaring prices. Therefore, we must not let down the government's good intentions. When determining prices, all industries should use the lowest actual cost as the standard. If the government has allocated yarn, the cost will be very low. Moreover, the prices of public utilities have not changed in the past two months, which is enough to lower the prices of finished products. Therefore, the first round of pricing must be reasonable so as not to arouse citizen resentment. In short, all colleagues in the industrial and commercial sectors should recognize one point: if the communists arrive, Shanghai will become a Soviet military base. Do we want to be a vassal of the Soviet Union, or do we want to fight for democracy? I sincerely hope that all industrial and commercial enterprises will do their part to assist the democratic government in resisting the communist rebellion.</p>
<h3>First Negotiate a Provisional Price</h3>
<p>Following the speech by Luo Qinghua, which briefly stated that the current economic track is in disarray, and cost accounting is difficult, but we must follow the instructions of the municipal authorities, and all industries should first negotiate a provisional price so that there will be goods on the market tomorrow. A reasonable price should be further negotiated in the long term.</p>
<h3>Various Industries Raise Opinions</h3>
<p>At this point, Yang Fusheng of the Shoe and Hat Trade Association, Liu Qingyi of the Silk Weaving Trade Association, Liu Yihe of the Tobacco Exchange Trade Association, and Li Bojia of the Book Trade Association, among others, raised opinions. Director Wu gave a comprehensive response, stating: The scope of pricing is limited to daily necessities, including not many items, which will be announced within a day or two. Items that are not daily necessities are not subject to control and can be priced by the trade associations according to production costs and submitted to the Social Affairs Bureau for approval.</p>
<p>Finally, Mr. Du Yuesheng advised all industries to be calm and support the government and assist the government to overcome difficulties together. The meeting adjourned at 7 o'clock.</p>
<h3>Meeting Scheduled Today to Discuss Wage Adjustment Issues</h3>
<p>[Our Reporter] Regarding the wage issue after the lifting of price controls, the supplementary measures stipulate that it should be determined by the local competent authorities with reference to the needs of maintaining workers' livelihoods. Director Wu of the Social Affairs Bureau has scheduled a meeting at 3 pm today at the bureau, inviting Vice Minister Lu Jingshi of the Central Ministry of Agriculture and Industry, representatives from the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, the Municipal Industrial Association, the General Labor Union, and the Workers' Welfare Committee, including Wu Yun Chu, Pan Shihao, Wang Zhuyi, Yao Shushen, Shui Xianyun, Shu Xuexiang, Ye Xianggao, and Zhang Zhusan, to discuss the matter together. Director Wu stated that he already has a draft in mind and will make a decision after collecting opinions from all parties. Whether to adopt a pay scale based on the cost of living index has not yet been decided.</p>
<h3>Supply Bureau Continues to Allocate Materials for Sale Today to Regulate the Market</h3>

<h3>Dance Halls to Collect Solatium Fees for Conscripts, Effective Immediately</h3>

In the future, the amount of this levy will be fully allocated for the solatium fees of new recruits. At the same time, the association has begun investigating restaurants with dance floor music equipment and is studying the method and amount of the levy.</p>
<h3>Jiang Jingguo Expresses Apologies and Issues a Letter to the Citizens</h3>
<p>[Our Reporter] Jiang Jingguo issued a letter to the citizens yesterday, the full text of which is as follows: "In the 70 days of work, I deeply feel that I have not fulfilled my due responsibilities. Not only have I failed to complete the plan and tasks, but in some places, I have aggravated the suffering of the citizens of Shanghai in the work process. I am determined not to push the responsibility that I should bear onto anyone, and I am also determined not to abandon my political views due to setbacks. I firmly believe that the path of 'Where Shanghai is Going' that I have pointed out is absolutely correct. Today, in addition to requesting punishment from the government to clarify responsibility, I express my deepest apologies to the citizens of Shanghai. Here, I am not trying to seek the forgiveness of the citizens, but to express my sense of responsibility to the citizens. I earnestly hope that the citizens of Shanghai will use their own strength to prevent speculators, profiteers, bureaucratic politicians, and local ruffians from controlling Shanghai again. I always believe that the future of Shanghai must be bright."</p>
<h3>Several Proposals from the Authorities in Charge: Goods Made from Price-Controlled Raw Materials Should Be Purchased and Distributed to Citizens; Legitimate Merchants Who Suffer Losses Should Also Be Compensated</h3>
<p>[Our Reporter] After the lifting of price controls, the person in charge of the Economic Control Office formally received reporters in the Central Bank conference room yesterday afternoon, emphasizing that although price controls have been lifted, the government should still not allow profiteers to take the opportunity to make a fortune. The prices of goods will be completely new from tomorrow onwards, but many goods were hoarded before August 19 or manufactured after the implementation of controls with allocated price-controlled raw materials and price-controlled wages. Especially for yarn and silk, both the Textile Corporation and the China Development Finance Corporation have allocated sales. Merchants should not make exorbitant profits by opening up the price controls. Therefore, it has been requested the Municipal Government to purchase these goods and distribute them to citizens at the price-controlled price to show fairness. Furthermore, ordinary legitimate merchants who operate on a small scale, such as cotton cloth stores and southern goods stores, did sell all their goods at the price-controlled price, causing them to suffer huge losses today. I hope that the Municipal Government can allocate some of the purchased goods to these stores, otherwise, it would be too unfair for those who are law-abiding to suffer.</p>
<p>Full Force Investigation of Undeclared Gold Certificates</p>
<p>After the deadline for the exchange of gold certificates, the Inspection Committee will devote all its efforts to investigating undeclared gold certificates. Those who are found will be confiscated. I feel very sorry for the citizens who have suffered significant losses today from exchanging gold certificates. If we do not strengthen the inspection of undeclared gold certificates in the future, I will be even more ashamed. In order to effectively complete the task, we are currently studying a non-disruptive method of informing.</p>
<p>Strengthening of the Rationing System is Desired</p>
<p>In the future, control work will be transferred to local governments. I believe that the rationing system is the most effective way to stabilize prices and calm people's hearts. I hope that the Municipal Government can strengthen its handling. The Economic Control Office can still be responsible for supplying oil, sugar, and coal for November and December. Furthermore, the three committees under the Economic Control Office will continue to exist in the future. The work of the Inspection Committee will focus on investigating undeclared gold certificates. The illegal goods confiscated by the Economic Control Office in the past will be transferred to the Central Bank for future refugee relief.</p>
<p>When asked about the issue of advancement and retreat, I did not give a definite answer, only saying, "I will do my duty for one day in office."</p>
<h3>Economic Control Inspection Committee's Focus of Work: Inspecting Gold Certificates and Cracking Down on National Accumulation</h3>
<p>The Shanghai District Inspection Committee of the Executive Yuan Economic Control Committee held a meeting at the National Bank yesterday. First, Jiang Jingguo described the new financial and economic supplementary measures promulgated by the government, and then stated: In the future, the exit of materials from this city will not be restricted. It was also resolved that the focus of future work will be divided into (1) strengthening the inspection of gold certificates, and (2) cracking down on profiteers' hoarding. Finally, a method of rewarding informants for reporting the possession of gold certificates was also adopted.</p>
<h3>Construction Team and Youth Service Team Stopped Activities Yesterday</h3>

In the future, there will be no restrictions on the export of materials.</p>
<p>According to the Economic Control Supervisor's Office, the barter method has also been decided to be discontinued.</p>
<h3>Oil Stores Refuse to Release Oil; Sauce and Wine Association Petitions</h3>

<h3>Movie and Theater Ticket Prices to Increase by One and a Half Times Starting Today; Mechanized Coal Ball Merchants Request a Two-Fold Increase</h3>
<p>[Our Reporter] The movie and theater industries in this city yesterday received approval from the Social Affairs Bureau to adjust ticket prices starting today, increasing them by 150% based on the August 19th price control.

<h3>800,000 Copper and Silver Subsidiary Coins Produced Daily; How to Issue Them Awaits Instructions from the Ministry of Finance</h3>

The copper mold engraving is very delicate. According to Director Wei of the Mint, the mint currently produces a total of no more than 800,000 copper and silver subsidiary coins per day due to power constraints. They are still being transported to the Central Bank Issuing Bureau as usual. How to issue them depends on the Central Bank requesting instructions from the Ministry of Finance.</p>
<h3>Eight Types of Price-Negotiated Items to Be Handled by the Formal Committee; Social Affairs Bureau Instructs Various Industries to Report Costs</h3>
<p>[Our Reporter] For the prices of goods after the lifting of price controls, except for yarn, cloth, sugar, coal, and salt, which are priced and regulated by the central competent authority, other important items, including daily necessities and industrial raw materials, are authorized by the central government to local governments to determine prices based on the supply situation. Yesterday, most shops in this city suspended business in the name of waiting for price negotiation. Various trade associations held meetings to discuss the matter, and some associations sent representatives to the Social Affairs Bureau to request adjustment of prices. The Social Affairs Bureau decided yesterday that the items to be negotiated are soybean oil, wool, woolen yarn, kerosene, coal balls, cigarettes, matches, and soap. The industrial raw materials will be decided after consulting with the Municipal Industrial Association. The Social Affairs Bureau has instructed the relevant trade associations to report production costs, which will be reviewed and decided by the Shanghai Municipal Price Negotiation Committee.

<h3>The Bottom of Xibao Xing Road Died; The Deceased Was Shot Several Times; The Criminals Were All Dressed in Military Uniforms; The Driver of the Xinsheng Automobile Company Is the Only Witness</h3>
<p>[Our Reporter] A dead man who had been shot, his body riddled with bullets, was found at about 5 pm on the 30th of last month at the bottom of Xibao Xing Road, at the junction of Yuexiu Road and the Lianyishan Zhuang (i.e., the Lin Family Garden), near the steps in the eastern grassy area. Zhang Xinkang, an official of the Zhuang, reported the incident to the Dachang Police Sub-Bureau, and Director Zhang ordered Criminal Section Chief He Peiji to lead officers Liu Zichang to the scene for investigation. The deceased was wearing a brand new tweed western-style jacket, gray striped suit, white shirt, black tie with white dots, silk short socks, and yellow leather shoes, with his head to the west and feet to the east. On the grass where the corpse was located, two bright Ma brand pistol bullets were found, and two bullet holes were found in the lower left part of the coat, one bullet hole in the left trouser leg, and one hole in the chest. A bullet was also dug out of the soil. A Beijing identity card was found next to the deceased's body.</p>
<p>The card read Huang Yanan</p>
<p>Thirty-one years old, from Beijing. A wallet was found with a check from Qichang Qianzhuang for 720 gold yuan, and 135.3 gold yuan. A note was found with the location and contact information of Zhang Wenqi, a member of the 4th Squadron of the Air Force. The Photography Section of the General Bureau was immediately telegraphed to send personnel to take photos in the countryside, and then the body was transported by car to the autopsy office on Changde Road to wait for examination. At that time, a business trip car with license plate number 03.3147, owned by Xinsheng Military Motor Company at 168 Wusong Road, was found parked at the gate of the Zhuang. Driver Cui Changjun was summoned to the bureau for interrogation. According to the confession, at about 1 pm on the same day, two men dressed as soldiers, speaking Chongqing dialect, came to the company to rent a car, stating</p>
<p>Round trip to Jiangwan</p>
<p>The car fee was 20 gold yuan. The accountant ordered him to drive the car on a business trip. After the two soldiers got into the car, they ordered him to drive towards Yuexiu Road. When they reached the middle section of the road, one of the soldiers, who was taller, ordered him to stop and get out of the car. The other soldier instructed the car to turn around and return to Shanghai. He drove to the Daxin Company on Nanjing Road to buy cigarettes without success. He drove to the cigarette stand at the Carlton Theatre to buy cigarettes, and then got out of the car across the road from the New World. After waiting for about 40 minutes, he came with a man in a suit (i.e., the deceased) and took the same car to a small alley at Yingshi Road and Fuxing Road. He ordered him to accompany them. After the two got out of the car, they came out after 15 minutes and went to the middle section of Yuexiu Road. One of the taller soldiers</p>
<p>Was already waiting there</p>
<p>After greeting, he re-entered the car and ordered him to go straight to Lianyishan Zhuang, saying he was going for a walk. While in the car, he vaguely heard the deceased say that he had booked 30 wedding banquets in Ping. The car was too noisy to hear anything else. According to eyewitnesses, a soldier crossed the wire fence behind the Zhuang and escaped across the stream. According to speculation, the cause of the case was a love affair. The sub-bureau is now sending detectives to hunt down the criminals for investigation.</p>
<h3>Jinde Girls' Middle School Campus Occupied; Press Invited Yesterday to Appeal</h3>
<p>[Our Reporter] The First Baptist Church of the Old North Gate of this city held a special reception for the press yesterday to explain the transfer of the property at 35 Maoming North Road. According to reports, the place was originally part of the Jinde Girls' Middle School campus. In 1942, fearing enemy spying, it was temporarily rented to Dr. Cao Fangtao to open a Lifesaving Pharmaceutical Factory. Unexpectedly, Cao Fangtao transferred the entire property to Wang Bingrong for occupancy during the lease period, and Wang Bingrong further subdivided the property into nine households. Because the church urgently needs to use the campus, it has formally notified the other party to move out, but they have not complied. Therefore, it has no choice but to file a lawsuit with the court and ask the media to uphold justice.</p>

<h3>Total Household Census to be Completed in Four Hours - Rumors of Simultaneous Searches of Warehouses Denied by the Director of Civil Affairs</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] The Municipal Government held a monthly meeting at 9:00 AM yesterday. Mayor Wu, Secretary-General Shen, Zhang Xiaosong, and over 200 staff members from various bureaus and departments attended. After Mayor Wu led the attendees in paying their respects, Zhang Xiaosong, Director of Civil Affairs, reported on the preparations for the household census. He stated that the Civil Affairs Bureau and the personnel of various districts and boroughs had been working hard on the preparation for the household census and the issuance of National Identification Cards. A portion of the newly printed National Identification Cards was sent to the suburban district offices for distribution yesterday, and they would be sent to the urban district offices in the next two days. It is expected that the new National Identification Cards will all be delivered to each household around the 5th of this month, and residents should fill them out themselves and keep the old National Identification Cards for collection by the district offices during the household census. Zhang also stated that the household census is scheduled to begin at 9:00 PM on the 8th of this month and end at 1:00 AM on the 9th, with the goal of completing it within four hours. Strict traffic control will be implemented in the city at that time.

To ensure that all city residents fully understand the meaning of the household census and the points to be noted, the Civil Affairs Bureau will cooperate with various radio stations to broadcast an explanation.</p>

<h3>Rice Market Resumes Trading - Nanshi White Keng Reaches a High of Eighty Yuan</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] After the authorities resumed free trade in the food market, new prices were quoted yesterday in both the North and South Rice Markets in the city. In the Nanshi Market, Wujiang rice was traded at 80 yuan per dan (a unit of dry measure), and ordinary paddy rice at 73 yuan. In the Beishi Market, injured and broken direct rice was traded at 78 yuan. Over 2,000 dan of rice arrived at both markets yesterday, but there was no significant increase. The total transaction volume was approximately 500 dan.</p>
<p>Another report: After the announcement of the new economic supplementary measures yesterday morning, which stipulated free trade in rice, the people of all parties expressed relief and satisfaction, and the amount of grain transported to Shanghai from various places continued to increase. In the Nanshi Market, thin paddy rice opened at 80 yuan and early rice at 73 yuan, but the transaction volume was not high. Rice merchants transported 718 shi (a unit of dry measure) on their own, and distributors handled 87 shi and 2.5 dou (a unit of dry measure) on their own. In the Beishi Market, second-grade white keng rice opened at 78 yuan, but there were no other transactions. Rice merchants transported 213 shi on their own, rice stores handled 277 shi on their own, non-grain merchants purchased 335 shi on their own, and rice mills transported 740 shi on their own. The total for both markets was 1924 shi and 2.5 dou.</p>
<p>Another report: In the miscellaneous grains market yesterday, due to the authorities lifting price controls and resuming free trade, traders automatically negotiated prices. Hankou green beans were quoted at 37 yuan, cowpeas at 40 yuan, corn at 61 yuan, red sorghum at 40 yuan, late beans at 40 yuan, winter beans at 45 yuan, and Xuzhou soybeans at 45 yuan, but these were not transaction prices. The edible oil and flour markets were still in a state of suspension due to the failure to obtain reasonable price adjustments.</p>
<h3>Foreign Exchange Policy Remains Unchanged for Now</h3>
<p>The foreign exchange policy is of great concern to all parties after the implementation of the economic supplementary measures. According to inquiries from a reporter of the United Credit Bureau to relevant parties, the government has no intention of changing the foreign exchange policy at present. A responsible person also solemnly denied rumors of an adjustment. However, judging from the current situation, after the lifting of price controls, there is a significant difference between domestic and foreign prices of goods. If this exchange rate is maintained, exports of goods may fall into a state of desperation.</p>
<p>According to well-informed sources, the government is being extremely cautious on this issue and will not act rashly. Once prices have stabilized somewhat, it will consider raising the exchange rate to ensure a continuous flow of exports.</p>
<h3>Increased Value of the Taiwan Dollar Hinders the Flow of Floating Capital to Taiwan</h3>
<p>The government's decision to increase the ratio of the Taiwan dollar to the Gold Yuan to 1000:1 will effectively hinder the surge of floating capital flowing to Taiwan Province. It is reported that since "August 19th," more than 30 million Gold Yuan has flowed into Taiwan Province, putting great pressure on prices in Taiwan Province. Currently, although remittances from Shanghai to Taiwan have been temporarily suspended, the amount of cash that travelers can carry is also strictly limited (travelers are allowed to carry a maximum of 1,000 Gold Yuan, with proof from the chairman of the trade association; merchants can carry 20 yuan to purchase goods, and public officials of state-owned provincial enterprises can carry 5,000 yuan), but the flow of funds to Taiwan still exceeds 50,000 Gold Yuan per day, while remittances from Taiwan to Shanghai are almost non-existent. This phenomenon was not seen before "August 19th," when remittances from Taiwan to Shanghai were far more frequent than remittances from Shanghai to Taiwan.</p>
<h3>Regulations for Issuing Foreign Exchange Settlement Certificates Stipulate a Set of Four Copies</h3>
<p>The National Bank's Business Bureau recently issued Circular No. 159 to all designated banks, stating: "Regarding the procedures for designated banks to issue Export Settlement Certificates CBC86, this bank has already stipulated and implemented them in Circular No. 157. This circular is hereby issued again for your reference and attention. Please ensure that only a set of four copies is issued in accordance with the regulations. If the export is re-exported through Hong Kong or Macau, only one additional special copy may be added."</p>
<h3>Deadline for Gold and Foreign Currency Redemption - Communication Reports to be Judged by Postmark</h3>
<p>October 31st was the last day of the deadline for redeeming gold and foreign currencies. The National Bank's Shanghai branch redeemed a total of 18.085 taels of gold, 27.06 taels of silver, 116.5 yuan in silver dollars, 408 silver dimes, US$225.35, HK$14.60, and 11.06 Philippine pesos that day. After the deadline for redeeming gold and foreign currencies, communication reports from other locations and rural mobile redemptions will also end simultaneously. Correspondence reports from other locations submitted before the deadline (October 31st) will be processed based on the postmark.</p>
<h3>Silk Industry Market Plans to Request Permission to Resume Operations</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] There is a strong desire among silk merchants to resume trading. However, due to the limited number of traders and the lack of domestic production of silk, traders have no way to purchase goods. Although the China Supplies Bureau is responsible for the overall allocation of raw materials needed by the silk weaving industry, the allocation is insufficient, and factories still feel that they cannot meet their needs. Now that the financial and economic supplementary measures have been announced, all equipment in the silk weaving industry is planned to be gradually put into operation, so the need for raw materials is even greater than before. Since the implementation of price controls, imports of raw silk have been virtually suspended, and the supply of silk fabrics to other locations has also decreased. After this opening, the demand from various places that have been thirsty for a long time will be greater than before August 19th. For the sake of universal supply, the industry plans to request permission from the relevant authorities to resume free market trading after the prices of various goods have been reviewed.</p>
<p>Since the implementation of economic controls, trading in the silk fabric market has been suspended after the Social Bureau notified that gatherings were to cease. Sales and trading by traders have been invisibly suspended. In the past, in order to implement the price control policy, the Silk Weaving Industry Association required each factory to hand over its products based on their total output. In addition to the raw materials allocated, the remaining products were distributed and sold to retailers by the association to meet the urgent needs of retail customers. Wholesalers have ceased operations under price controls. Now that price controls have been lifted on various items, and silk fabrics are not a major daily necessity, the relevant parties still plan to request permission from the authorities to resume market operations.</p>
<h3>Cotton Cloth Manufacturers Gather to Discuss Prices - The Lowest Price for Longtou Fine Cloth Outside the Market is 60 Yuan</h3>
<p>Yesterday, cotton cloth trading did not resume because manufacturers were gathered to discuss prices and it was difficult to determine prices. Yesterday afternoon, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce convened various industries to discuss the matter, and the cloth stores decided to open for business today. In off-market cotton cloth trading, Longtou cloth was quoted starting from 60 yuan, with transactions reaching as high as 75 yuan, Four Gentlemen Serge was 80 yuan, and No. 190 high-end Shilin cloth was 140 yuan.</p>
<p>Another report: The China Textile Construction Company has also temporarily suspended rationing and will proceed after the central authorities have approved the prices. The various types of cloth produced by dyeing and weaving factories will also be priced after adjusting the costs.</p>
<p>Another report: After the announcement of the financial and economic supplementary plan, the cotton yarn market also plans to resume trading. However, after two months of closure, wholesalers' inventories have mostly been sold continuously, and current inventories are extremely low. According to a person in charge of the association, yarn merchants themselves cannot take the initiative in determining whether the market can be restored. In addition to the legal requirements, cotton yarn must be supplied by the factories. Today, because there are no regulations in the supplementary plan for the resumption of free trading of cotton yarn, the association will wait for the Municipal Chamber of Commerce to convene a meeting of various industries to discuss the matter before requesting the relevant authorities.</p>
<p>Another report: There has never been a market for cotton trading. In the past, cotton merchants and spinning mills traded and fellow traders bought and sold through brokers. However, since the price limit, the source has been cut off, there has been not much business, and traders have not sold their goods. Now that the financial and economic supplementary measures have been announced, the original plan to exchange yarn for cotton in the National Cotton Joint Purchase will also be changed. In order to maintain business survival, cotton merchants also plan to gradually resume trading after the Joint Purchase Association has approved the flower collection prices in various places.</p>
<h3>Tea Market Has Strong Buying Interest</h3>
<p>Since the Executive Yuan's order to relax price controls and implement negotiated prices was transmitted to Shanghai, the supply of red and green tea varieties has been sluggish, affected by the depletion of stocks. Therefore, although the buying interest is still strong, it is difficult to get what one wants, and trading continues to be suspended. The market atmosphere is even more lively. Looking ahead, a brilliant future is expected.</p>
<h3>Sugar Trading Has Not Yet Started</h3>
<p>The Sugar Market situation, yesterday, the association had no dynamics, because the sugar pricing category, subject to central approval, the market can not resume, needs to be quiet and look at the trends of various industries, people in the industry and more to seek the restoration of market transactions, but there has been no any discussion.</p>
<h3>Five Ocean Trading Still Stalled</h3>
<p>The cigarette market attached to the Five Ocean Industry Association was temporarily suspended after being ordered a few days ago, the market trading stalled. Today, after the Executive Yuan's improved economic management supplementary measures were announced, although firewood, rice, oil and salt and other items have resumed free trading, the prices of daily necessities must be agreed upon by the association and submitted for approval. Before approval, trading is still in a state of suspension. The association is currently processing the procedures, and once approved, the association can resume trading.</p>

<h3>Prelude to the US Election (8): A Prediction</h3>
<p>— Special Correspondent for This Newspaper</p>
<p>From the Communist Party's Twelve Gold Medals to Truman's Change of Guard</p>
<p>[Dispatch from New York, October 24th, from this newspaper] The only difference in this year's American election compared to previous ones is the wiping out of the American Communist Party. In the past, the chairman of the American Communist Party, Foster, was often included on the ballot for presidential candidates in New York State. Although very few people voted for Foster, in a liberal country, political parties freely competing in elections is a right that citizens should have under the guarantee of the constitution. However, this year's situation has changed. Since the international spy case was revealed, the American judicial authorities believe that the American Communist Party intends to overthrow the current government by violent means. Therefore, at the turn of summer and autumn, they arrested the twelve leading figures of the American Communist Party one after another, including the chairman of the Communist Party, heads of various departments, the mastermind of the women's movement, and even the instigators of the workers' movement in major cities. Some of them voluntarily surrendered to the "Federal Bureau of Investigation," while most were arrested by secret police.</p>
<p>Wallace's New Shop</p>
<p>Of course, the current situation is not as simple as it was in the past. The deterioration of US-Soviet relations is the main reason why the Communist Party lost its freedom of movement. In the United States, some people have requested the temporary release of Foster and his companions so that they can participate in the election on November 2nd, and after the election is over, the court can ask them to "return to the cage." This is a compromise that takes both theory and reality into account. However, after considering the results, the Supreme Court finally rejected this flexible compromise. The election ballot has already been determined not to include the names of Communist Party candidates, and in early November, before the general election, the Communist Party's "Twelve Gold Medals" will be formally tried publicly for "treason."</p>
<p>Because of these reasons, a large number of American "quasi-communists" and "semi-communists" have flocked to Wallace's newly opened shop. Wallace, out of "sympathy" for black people and Jews, simply moved into the homes of black people and Jews. In the past, Wallace also said: "If I were president, US-Soviet relations would not be so bad," and "If there are any difficulties, as long as I talk to Stalin, there will be a solution." Now he has simply accepted Stalin unconditionally. Wallace's current formula is: anything the Soviet Union does must be right, and any friction in US-Soviet relations must be the fault of the American rulers.</p>
<p>Marshall, the White Ant</p>
<p>After returning from a campaign trip to the Midwest, Wallace scolded Truman as a "big puppet." He said that since Truman fired the "New Economists" (i.e., the leftists of the Roosevelt era), Truman has actually abdicated. Presidential power has fallen into the hands of Wall Street tycoons and military officials, and Truman is nothing more than a figurehead. Wallace scolded Marshall, calling him a white ant. He said that Marshall's seizure of the State Department is like white ants occupying the beams of a hall. Over time, they will inevitably eat away the beams, causing the building to collapse. Wallace also said that Marshall hurriedly flew back from the Paris United Nations General Assembly, nominally to visit the president, but in reality, he did not talk to Truman for more than a few minutes. Marshall spent most of his time with Secretary of Defense Forrestal and large and small warlords, peddling war in large quantities.</p>
<p>After the "Vincent Affair"</p>
<p>Wallace also said that if Truman wants to be determined to save himself, the only way is to dismiss Marshall. In fact, since the so-called "Vincent Affair," Truman has naturally felt a bit disgusted with Marshall. Marshall, in Paris, felt that his boss was "sabotaging" him from behind, and he must have been full of complaints in Paris, just like Byrnes did the year before. After Marshall returned to Washington, Truman announced the cancellation of the idea of ​​"Vincent as an envoy to the Soviet Union," and the matter was generally considered to have come to an end. Unexpectedly, more than ten days later, this President, once again made a bold statement at Miami Beach: "In my opinion, sending Vincent to Moscow to negotiate directly with Stalin may not be the best way to seek peace"! Marshall, far away in Paris, must be so anxious that he would "hang himself" when he heard this!</p>
<p>Truman is Bound to Go</p>
<p>The disagreement between Truman and Marshall does not represent a contradiction in foreign policy, but represents the chaos and incompetence of the current US regime. After Truman fired two cannons in Miami, the editorial of New York's "Daily News," which has the largest circulation, wrote: "Mr. Truman, we ask you, we ask you not to make random comments anymore. Although you are useless and incompetent, you are still the president of a world-leading country... Don't say those stupid things from a Missouri hick anymore, and always remember that you are the president of the richest and most powerful country"!</p>
<p>Truman is bound to go, and there is probably no question about it. A campaign prediction expert from the New York Times estimated that out of the 531 "electoral units" in all 48 states (i.e., the votes of the "presidential electors"), the Republican Dewey may get 334 votes. Regardless of whether this prediction is accurate, the Democratic Party's sixteen years in the White House will obviously be the time for a "change of guard" this time! (End of full text)</p>
<h3>The Silk Industry in Wuxing is Declining: Attention Should be Paid to Two Major Root Causes</h3>
<p>[Dispatch from Hangzhou, October 28th, from this newspaper] After arriving in Wuxing, the reporter investigated the local silk industry, and the details have been reported in yesterday's newspaper. Regarding the question of why the silk industry in Wuxing is so depressed, people in the area have put forward many reasons, but in the final analysis, it is nothing more than two major root causes: dyeing and conservatism. Because Wuxing's dyeing is not sophisticated, all colored silk will change color, so everyone does not come to inquire about it. However, if they all transported colored silk from Shanghai to make it like Dachang, it can be said that they do not have such hot capital. The silk factories in Shanghai have seen through Wuxing's hidden places, so they make colored silk themselves, which is much more convenient than transporting colored silk to Wuxing for weaving. In fact, dyeing is not sophisticated is also a kind of conservatism. If we specially recruit experts to study dyeing, there is no reason why we cannot dye good colors. At the same time, the patterns of weaving, and the conversion of native silk to factory silk, all need to be researched and improved in order to find a way out. The silk weaving industry in Wuxing silently abides by the rules, still regards itself as the "home of silk" in China, but does not study the reasons for its decline, which is really regrettable.</p>
<p>Furthermore, in a place like Wuxing, which produces silk, it should be particularly emphasized and more research institutions should be added. However, in addition to a province-run sericulture school, Wuxing cannot find a school that studies silk weaving. In the only silk industry elementary school in Wuxing, the courses taught are no different from those of ordinary elementary schools. The reporter believes that a silk weaving [school] should be established, with the nature of a secondary school, specializing in the improvement of silk weaving, and then seeking the reform of the entire Wuxing silk weaving industry.

<h3>Golden Monkey to Fly to America</h3>
<p>May be Publicly Exhibited When Passing Through Shanghai</p>
<p>[Dispatch from Chengdu, October 28th, from this newspaper] The National Museum of the United States previously requested from the Sichuan Provincial Government a gift of the "Golden Monkey," a world-renowned rare animal that is unique to Sichuan and is as famous as the panda, for display and exhibition.

<h3>Double-Bodied Freak Arrives in Suzhou from Wuxi</h3>

<h3>The Bleak Autumn in Xi'an</h3>
<p>— Zhang Xianzhou, Reporter for This Newspaper</p>
<p>[Dispatch from Xi'an, October 27th, from this newspaper] August in the Northwest is the end of summer and the beginning of autumn, with blue sky, white clouds, and the cold desert. Time gives people an invigorating season. After the announcement of the "August 19th" economic reform plan, the ancient city was indeed lively for a while. After the long summer of bitter rain, people were hoping for a pleasant autumn to take a deep breath of stuffiness, but time flies, and who would have thought that after two months, the past lively scene has turned into a bleak situation in front of us. The future is long, and if we don't find a way to solve it sooner, who would have thought that its consequences would be so bad?</p>
<p>The prices of goods in Xi'an are keeping pace with Shanghai. When Shanghai rises, prices here will naturally rise. When Shanghai cannot sell goods, Xi'an will of course not be able to sell goods. Keeping pace with Shanghai, that's all.</p>
<p>At the beginning of October, strange phenomena occurred in the market in Xi'an. The goods on the shelves of many large stores disappeared overnight. The city gate was ordered to strictly prohibit the outflow of materials, but there was nothing to be seen in the stores in the city.</p>
<p>The municipal government could no longer tolerate it. Especially after the buying spree occurred, accusations came from all sides. Mayor Wang and Yan Siling Cao Rihui of Xi'an, on the one hand, ordered the military police to urge the merchants to open their doors to the market, and on the other hand, ordered the shock troops to raid the hoarders everywhere. Wang and Cao also personally took the car to patrol the central urban area to strictly investigate the scalpers who were reselling goods, and staged funny scenes of "spanking" and "masquerade parade" on the street.</p>
<p>The shops opened, but they only sold for one day. Every family was extremely empty and had nothing to sell. Until today, department stores open every day, but there is still no business to be done.</p>
<p>On the eve of the great war in eastern Shaanxi, the Shaanxi Provincial Government sent three members, Chen Guting, Shi Zhi, and Zhang Danping, to inspect the blockade line bordering the bandit area. The results they obtained were fruitful and fair. At a press conference, Member Zhang frankly admitted the serious phenomenon of material leakage. He said that according to the results of his investigation, unscrupulous merchants colluded with the Communist bandits. At that time, every two taels of gold could be exchanged for twenty-four taels of opium when transported to the Communist area. The round trip would be four times the profit, so it was enthusiastically sought after by desperadoes. Speaking of the methods of smuggling across the border, there are roughly two types: one is to cross the blockade line from small roads, and the other is to collectively armed forced crossing, in coordination with the military operations of the bandit army. Most of those bandits rode horses and carried guns. When the bandit side broke through a certain stronghold of the National Army, the entire line was tense, and they rushed through the town.</p>
<p>A sad rain, several autumn gatherings, calculated by the multiple of the price of goods, this year's chrysanthemums in Xi'an are the cheapest. I heard that even so cheap, it is still difficult to sell.</p>
