<h3>新任國防部長　徐永昌昨就職　何前部長親臨辦移交</h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿四日電〕新任國防部長徐永昌，廿四日晨九時就職，由前部長何應欽親自交代，並召集該部及陸·海·空·勤各總部職員訓話，何氏訓示時，勉以發揚革命精神意志及信念，奮勉努力，團結一致，堅守不渝，並發揚光大，何氏並介紹徐部長，相信在徐氏領導下，必能達成在其本人任內未達成之任務。徐氏訓詞稱：過去本部在何部長領導下，已具優良規模，今後自當簫規曹隨，並勉全體同仁團結努力，克盡厥責。何·徐兩氏致詞全文如次：</p>
<p>何氏演詞</p>
<p>本人就任本部部長，巳經半年，回憶今年春天自美返國述職，並出席國民大會，正值行憲政府成立，奉總統的命令，翁院長和各方友好袍澤的敦促，担任首屆行憲政府的國防部長，當時本人曾經感到自從服務軍旅，已經三十多年，在抗戰勝利受降完畢以後，卽已衷心希望能夠暫卸仔肩，解除軍職，而以國民一份子的資格，對於國家的復興和建設有所貢獻，所以對於國防部長一職，本人曾經一再懇辭，但以當時情况非本人勉任艱鉅，和各方同志共同努力不可，所以於就職之初，卽兢兢業業，着手官兵生活的改善，國軍士氣的提高，希望將這兩個最基本的要求解決以後，軍事形勢必可逐漸好轉，但是國家經過八年抗戰，和三年剿匪的戰爭，無論人財物各方面的困難，可以說與時俱增，半年以來，因為種種關係，應欽在許多方面，未能達到所預期之目的，亦未盡到本身所應負之責任，衷心至為愧疚，但是各位同志和全國陸海空軍袍澤，在艱苦的條件之下，始終努力不懈，協助本人執行任務，現在於臨別之時，本人不得不對各位表示至誠的感激。</p>
<p>各位同志，目前的情勢，無可諱言是異常艱難，但是在臨別的時候，我要勉勵各位一句話，那就是發揚我們革命的精神意志和信念，各位同志應當知道，革命軍人既然以身許國家，以身許主義，那麽我們就必須為了國家的復興，為了主義的實現，愈在危難的時候，愈要奮勉努力，團結一致，達成我們所負的神聖任務。祗有這種精神，這種意志，這種信念，才是我們革命軍人安身立命的所在。各位一定要將這種精神·意志·信念堅守不渝，發揚光大，那麽國家和國軍的前途，都會光明無限。現在新任部長徐次宸將軍已經就職，徐部長在抗戰時期主持軍令部，勝利後，直到現在，主持陸軍大學，對於用兵作戰，以及高級幕僚的訓練，都曾具有極豐富的經騐與優異的成績。各位同志今後在徐部長和頭總長領導之下，一定能達成在本人任內所未能完成的任務，這是本人於臨別之時，所引為欣慰的。至於本人今後無論是否担任公職，必然仍當以國民一份子的身份，盡其所能，貫獻國家，並在精神上和各位同志始終一致，最後祝徐部長健康，各位同志努力。</p>
<p>徐氏演詞</p>
<p>此次政院改組，本人奉命承乏本部部長，際此時會，深感責任重大，異常惶恐，惟本部在何部長領導之下，一切設施已具優良規模，今後自當蕭規曹隨，甚盼何部長爾後對於本部業務，仍能隨時予以指導，並希各位同志，精誠團結，繼續努力，以期不負重寄。</p>

<h3>外報記者抵蚌訪問剿總　章毓金解釋戰局　淮北連日雨雪戰事膠着</h3>
<p>〔本報蚌埠廿四日電〕倫敦觀察報記者杜諾文，每日快報記者史密斯，每日郵報記者麥唐納等一行，今晨乘南自京抵蚌，午後訪此間剿總，由剿總發言人章毓金少將答覆渠等對當前戰局之各項詢問。據章氏稱，由於淮北連日雨雪，戰事已呈膠着狀態，匪軍於蚌宿會戰結束後，分集於三處整理，渦陽·蒙城附近為劉伯承部三個縱隊，靈璧·泗縣附近，為陳毅部二個縱隊，固鎮以北及宿縣附近為陳劉兩部共六個縱隊，其餘殘匪包括蚌宿戰後從劉匪殘部中抽出之三萬餘人，則均在永城符離集一綫，企圖圍困杜聿明所部。根據情報，估計共匪於徐州蚌宿兩次會戰中，所動用之兵力，不下七十餘萬，目前僅剩餘二十五萬人上下，其中劉匪約為十萬，陳匪約為十五萬；國軍方面，杜聿明將軍指揮下者尙有十二萬之兵力，刻已在永城睢溪口一綫附近，構成一直徑約十五公里之陣地，日來正在惡劣天氣所造成之艱苦環境中，與匪相持。南綫李延年兵團，現有五個軍之兵力，其中有三個軍置於第一綫之澥河流域，懷遠及蚌埠外圍均有重兵扼守，淮南津浦兩路亦有勁旅布防。章於答覆原防蚌埠今同云訪問之聯合社戰地記者之問詢中，否認共匪曾有主力渡過淮河。渠對剿總遷移　縣之解釋，爲蚌埠現爲前綫，指揮機構必需移至後方，始能進退自如，以應付當前局面可能發生之變化，且剿總今後需統一指揮。蘇北及皖西北之軍事行動，滁縣之位置比較適宜。某記者復吿以渠自京赴蚌之兩日旅程中，每日至少曾見有十節火車運兵南下，並携有甚多之補給。章氏當答稱：係黃維兵團赴江南地區整理。該記者復詢以如此多之補給，何以必需隨黃兵圍南運而不留於蚌埠供其他部隊使用？章氏則稱：此因剿總不願留置更多之補給於蚌埠之故。最後一問題係每日快報記者所提出，渠問：至必要時期，在長江下游以北滁縣以南地區中，國軍所能動員之兵力為若干？又，現地國軍在淮河戰綫動用之兵力為若千？章氏吿以長江以北滁縣以南國軍能動用之兵力，約在三十萬人以上，最近國軍在淮河戰綫所動用之兵力，除皖中及蘇北外，約為十餘萬人（按皖中至少有三個軍，蘇北有七萬餘人）。章氏答覆詢閒畢，劉峙總司令卽步入會客室接見各記者。劉氏以坦率之語調，闡明渠對當前戰局之感想與希望，計為兩點：（一）此度會戰中，國軍確有許多方面未能配合得宜，以致不能盡殲匪軍為一憾事；（二）渠期望不久國軍能發動一次攻勢，以完成尙未達成之任務。</p>
<p>〔本報蚌埠廿四日電〕剿總公佈：（一）懈河淝河地區間國軍，近因天雪，除不斷分遺小部隊醫雪出動向匪搜索外，主力則利用時機，就地整理，一俟天晴卽繼續出擊。（二）北綫杜聿明部方面，亦因天雪，仍在原位置與匪相持，僅有砲戰。</p>
<p>〔中央社蚌埠廿四日電〕淮北戰塲因連日雨雪己成休止狀態，此間十九日夜開始落雨，迄廿二日午始停，廿二日夜復降大雪，廿三日晨淮河兩岸己成一片銀色世界，三日來上空未見飛機活動，地面部隊之行動亦大受遲滯。據前方報吿，我渡澮部隊，正向匪作威力搜索，固鎮迄宿縣間現僅有少數土共活動，劉伯承匪部已竄黃泛區阜陽太和等地整補，永城東北靑龍集附近三日來亦無較大戰鬥，匪我雙方仍在原陣地相持中。</p>

<h3>社論　存兌金銀的繼續問題</h3>
<p>技術考慮欠周的存兌金銀辦法，終於因演出了慘劇而暫行停止了。停止不難；難在如何改善。</p>
<p>以各地人民爭兌金銀的擁擠而論，職者早知必釀事故；果然，本市於二十二日竟演出一塲悲喜劇。在銀行開門之前，早就有數萬人不顧宵禁，爭兌金銀，把外灘一帶變成人海，銀行四週軋得水洩不通，憲警用盡各種方法，也維持不了秩序，終致市民被擠踏死傷的有數十人之多。為了一兩黃金或四十九個銀元，竟不惜以自已的性命去拚，這種「要錢不要命」的愚蠢思想，可笑亦復可憐。聞政府還是堅持其存兌政策，不過想改善辦法。其實，目前應該在設想改善辦法而外，不妨連帶考慮到這個存兌政策的本身問題了！</p>
<p>就國家的經濟政策來看，用存兌金銀政策來收縮通貨，從而穩定物價，在原則上是沒有錯誤的。最近一月來的物價，並不急劇上漲，不能不說是存兌政策的成功；而且昨天祗停兌一天，物價一般的就騰高了三四成，更可見得存兌金銀確實收了相當效果。但是，通貨過分收縮，銀根緊迫，首受其害的是本市的工業界，一方面旣感到資金調度的困難，另一方面又因人民購買力薄弱，實銷呆滯，各工廠的再生產勢將陷於停頓狀態，於是開放工貸，乃成為本市工商界一致的要求，政府為搶救工業，也不得不照辦，因此大批工貸的流出，又將把存兌政策收縮通貨的作用抵銷了。所以，嚴格言之，存兌政策在原來的目的上，幾已失去其意義。再觀於存兌金銀的價格與黑市價格的懸殊，可知繼續辦理存兌政策，若不隨時加以修改，則勢必徒然浪費國庫金銀的支出，便利少數人的擠兌取利，而與大多數人的生活無關。今日即使停止存兌金銀，也並不是不合理的。</p>
<p>不過，我們也知道這次政府辦理存兌金銀的由來，完全基於「取之於民，還之於民」的原則，才想出來的辦法，故縱使現在流弊百出，仍不得不繼續辦理，不便「因噎廢食」，只好在執行的技術上多多籌劃改進。聞政府當局對於改善存兌辦法，正在審議中；我們但願政府今後如有修正辦法，與其求速而多疏漏，還不如稍稍愼重而勿再朝令夕改，</p>
<p>我們姑且提出下列幾點意見，供當局的參考：</p>
<p>第一，政府應先打算究竟有多少金銀兌出來，再作一通盤計劃。因為，如果照『無限制存兌』的原則來講，而又說每個國民都可以來存兌，存兌的利益又隨黑市而遞增，則依理而論，政府勢非準備一二萬萬兩黃金不可。否則，只有像上海這些大都市的人民存兌，內地和鄉下的老百姓沒有機會享着存兌的權利，於理豈得謂平？而且，政府只是兌出，沒有收進，比宋院長時代明拋暗買的黃金政策還要『慷慨』，究竟有多少金銀可以堵塞這個無底的『淘金慾堅』！</p>
<p>第二，公敎人員和軍警，都是為國家執行任務的人，時局嚴重至此，豈可讓他們人人在那裏設法張羅現鈔擠兌金銀，而暫置其職務於不顧。政府果眞富有金銀，而願為他們打算，與其阱他們存兌，何不在三個月（？）中發薪餉時，搭發一次百分之幾的金銀，以免發了金圓券再阱他們來存兌，多費手脚？</p>
<p>第三，存兌金銀的價格應與黑市價格相差不遠，或可以規定隨市調整。否則擠一天兌到一兩金子，便可賺到一　千金圓，超過他一月的薪水收入，誰不願去擠一擠呢？你去我也去，身份證的市價也跟高了，一下子銀行門前就擠了數萬人，自為必然之事。我們對於擠兌的人，不論他是『黃牛』也好，或普通市民也好，我們只能表示同情，可憐他們！要讓人民不再擠兌，免得他們再是見利『殺身』，只有將存兌金銀的價格，隨時跟着市價調整，則旣無重利可得，人民亦不致『冒險犯難』去做淘金夢了。</p>
<h3>存兌短期內恢復　新辦法正研擬中　徐堪兪鴻鈞昨交換意見</h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿四日電〕存款兌換金銀暫行停止後，改善存兌之新辦怯，正由財部會同中央銀行積極研擬中，決於最短期內擬訂改善辦怯，恢復存兌。廿四日下午，財長徐堪與央行總裁兪鴻鈞，曾就改善存款兌現辦怯交換意見。廿四日上午，財部錢幣司長吳興周亦曾與央行京分行經理陳慶瑜等再度會商改善存兌新辦怯。據悉：滬市存兌之所以發生擠死人慘劇，乃因國行發存兌申請書較其他各地為多，每一擠兌者獲得申請書之可能性均甚大，故擠兌者達數萬人，為接受過去敎訓，今獲之發申請書辦法，將作妥善之改正。</p>

<h3>監委對揚子公司糾舉書（續昨）</h3>
<p>十一月十八日准上海市政府市機卅七字第一三四一函略開，揚子建業公司囤積一案，囑迅將依照取締囤積居奇實施注意事項（九）本辦法第十六條所稱之規定，對於該公司簿籍單據倉棧及其他存貨地點，必須切實調查，至外傳該公司在利喊公司囤有禁止進口之新汽車多輛一節，並囑一併詳查見復等由，當經令飭警察局並派林參事會查，據簽稱：關於所報貨物是否與箱內相符，經於十月卅日及卅一日前往各倉庫淸查，並將較重要貨品開箱查點，除查出未列報之四種貨品外，其餘均屬相符，關於貨物進口是否合法一項，經於十月卅日上午將情册所列貨物與進口關單逐一核對，經查該項貨品均已完成海關手續，繳稅進口。關於在利喊公司囤有禁止進口之小汽車多輛，經查得利喊公司現在有輸管會核准進口之新汽車五十二輛，新卡車六輛，另有寄存之汽車七輛，並由公司經理葛泰利證明，該公司為一外人經營之商業，與揚十建業公司並無商業上關係等情，並據警察局呈復前來，復核揚子建業公司登記存貨中之工業原料及日用必需品處理辦怯，經准行政院上海區經濟管制督導員辦公處於十一月六日以滬經督字第八八六號函達本府，規定按照限價供應市塲，並請會同上海區物資調節委員會統籌支配在案，除令飭社會。警察兩局遵照，會同調節委員會迅予辦理外，復請察照。此卽為主管官署最後之熊度與處置。</p>
<p>關於利喊公司所存汽車，據報現存雪佛蘭及奧斯汀小汽車四十輛，飛愛特小汽車十二輛，雪佛蘭卡車六輛，另有已售未取走之雪佛蘭，奧斯汀，飛愛特小車七輛，但經輸出入管理委員會查報，該公司前後核准輸入雪佛蘭及奧斯汀兩種汽車共三二四輛，其中並無飛愛特，而該公司所列報之飛愛特十二輛，全為揚十建業公司所申請之輸入，此外又有華貴之卡地洛克汽車三輛未曾列報，後經詢問，據吿係孔祥熙·孔令侃所存，市府復文中所稱，利喊公司經理莫泰利證明該公司與揚子建業公司並無商業上之關係一節，實屬謊言。復經向社會局調查，該利喊公司原為在上海之英籍商人所組織，於民國十九年在香港政府登註　計資本總額為紋銀一百五十萬兩，並未經繳足，亦達當時國幣一百二十萬元，嗣於三十六年十月變更登記，另行改組，除保有英籍三董事外，其餘原有之英籍四董事，已改由中國籍之周其鏞，宋子昂，錢起鳳，李堯蓀担任，並以周其鏞為董事長，宋子昂一度任公司經理，此四人皆為揚子建業公司重要職員，如周其鏞為該公司進口部經理，李堯蓀為進口部襄理，宋子昂為工業部經理，錢起鳳為財務處處長，且利喊公司資本甚大，變更半數以上之董事，必有新董事參加鉅大之投資，外傳揚子建業公司曾以七十五萬至一百萬美金收購利喊公司股權百分之八十，實不為無因，再證以揚子建業公司本年進口之飛愛特汽車十二輛存在利喊公司，而利喊公司不惜一再謊言否認，此兩者之關係更昭然若揚矣，以上卽為復查之全部情形。（下文轉入第四版）</p>

<h3>安理會令荷印停戰　並立即釋放印尼總統及所有政治犯　印尼在蘇門答臘成立政府</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕紐約廣播：新加坡訊：印尼共和國駐新辦事處宣布：印尼共和國巳在蘇門答臘成立，由經濟部長沙福祿亭領導。</p>
<p>〔台衆社廿四日巴黎電〕聯合國安理會今日通過決議，要求印荷停戰。美國會建議雙方撤退軍隊，則被否決。安理會並決議，荷方應立卽釋放印尼總統及其他政治犯。今日英美蘇三細皆要求荷軍立卽自印尼撤退。英代表但寗宣布贊成美國建議，卽雙方軍隊須卽撤至上星期六戰事爆發前之位置。蘇代表馬立克另提建議，除要求撒軍外，並要求釋放被捕之印尼領袖，此外，韭主張由安理會全部理事國代表組織一委員會，處理此項爭端，監視荷關之撒軍。法代表對本案各項建議，均未投票，因法方懷疑安理會究竟有無處理印尼問題之能力。怯代表柏洛第稱：荷蘭之「驚人暴行」，無可置疑，但怯國雖對印尼表示同情，但法國之立塲純係根據法理，蓋印尼共和國依法實不能認為係聯合國憲章下之一份子，且根據國際法，印尼亦尙不成其為一個國家。故荷蘭之行動，仿係內政性質，安理會不能千涉。</p>
<p>〔合衆社廿四日巴黎電〕今日安理會以七票對零票通過印荷停戰案，四票棄權，棄權之國家為比·法·蘇及烏克蘭。撒軍案之表決結果為五票贊成，反對者零票，六票棄權，贊成者未過半數，故不成立。</p>
<p>〔聯合社巴黎廿三日電〕今日安理會散會時，各國代表晴示廿四日起可能每日討論三次，聖誕日或將會議不輟。</p>
<p>〔聯合社巴達維亞廿四日電〕末里芬方面之印尼共和國電台今日停止播音，大約此一印尼第三大城亦已被荷軍佔領。該電台最後一次廣播稱：末里芬廿二日遭荷蘭飛機五架轟炸及掃射，房屋十所坍毀，死傷十四人。</p>

<h3>參議會大會　三重要課題　如何保衛大上海　平衡市財政預算　定房租計算標準</h3>
<p>據參議會發言人稱，本次大會，截至昨日止，巳向秘書處辦妥報到手續之參議員計卅餘人，議案則尙未正式提出，一般預料，本次大會中將以保衛地方，平衡預算及房租問題為三大討論重心。卅八年度市預算，雖巳由市府編定，尙未送達參會審查。至房租問題，上海市房客總聯合會昨曾舉行房租標準審定會議，出席各里弄房客代表百餘人。經縝密討諭，最後決定本市房租最高限額，為住宅用房屋戰前法幣每元折合金圓券五角，營榮用房屋，戰前法幣每元折合金圓券六角五分，此項標準之計算方式，係以參會於本年三月問原決議七千倍及九千倍為原則，折合金圓券後，乘以本年八至十二月本市職工指數與公敎薪給之混合平均倍數而得。該會決定上項標準後，卽將正式建議參會本次大會採納，函請有關當局公佈實施。幷悉房聯會秘書長邵永生參議員，此次因飛機失事罹難後，該會昨已改選常務委員馬君碩為秘書長，李玉書為常務委員。</p>

<h3>新兵安家補助費　各區保自行籌集　市兵役協會說明另行籌給原因</h3>
<p>此次各區保籌收新兵安家補助費，一般市民因未具體明瞭，多有函向兵役協會及各報館詢問究竟。茲悉：該項新兵安家補助費之籌集，韭非由兵役協會辦理，所收款項，亦不繳由兵役協會轉發，全係區保自行籌集，作為各該區新兵安家補助費之用。其徵收辦怯，係根據民政局所訂「上海市各區籌給新兵安家補助費要則」辦理。查兵役協會上半年曾經徵收新兵安家費、最近本市各舞廳亦在代收新兵安家費，此次區保另行籌收，一般市民容有疑惑據兵役協會說明：本市三十七年度新兵，第一期計配六千名，當時為鼓勵應徵，決定每名新兵發給安家費食米二十石（依戶口米價格折發），由市政府公佈「三十七年度新兵安家費徵收辦法」，向本市現役及齡男子及無出徵壯丁住戶分以食米（共五級依戶口米價格折徵）及法幣（共三級）評定徵收。當時據各區所評額徵數字，差可敷足六千名新兵之用，但後因米價步漲，及徵收安家費與徵集新兵之形成反比例（即米價低時徵收較旺而兵少，高漲時兵多而無徵收），在徵至三千名新兵時，所徵新兵安家費已完全吿罄。該項新兵安家費之發放，計自七月份每名七千萬元起，最高增至每名為三億元。嗣幣制改革，兵役協會為求繼續徵集，曾以緩徵召壯丁優待金（優待征屬專款）設法墊用，一面並將安家費提高至每名金圓二百元，但以物價關係，仍無志願應征。同時本市新兵復奉配征四千四，連前欠共達七千名之多，中央旣催征緊迫而前征安家費已告結束，雖曾多方而籌劃，均無成就。至十一月初，始由本市二十六家舞廳就茶資代為帶收，但以為數有限，僅能雜持每名二百元之數目，無怯使之增加，以僅僅二百元之安家費，自難望有志願投効。民政局應各區保之一致要求，及實際需要，乃訂頒自籌補助費辦怯，由各區另行籌給安家補助，以期順利徵集而完成兵額。又該項籌給要則，關於籌集保管發放及監察等等，均有具體規定，各界可隨時予以監視，如有浮　舞弊情形，應予儘量糾舉，以杜流弊云。</p>

<h3>監委對揚子公司糾舉書（上接第二版）</h3>
<p>（子）揚士建業公司應受停業處分，其涉及司法部份，並應移送法院究辦。</p>
<p>（一）查揚子建業公司由川五年四月以法幣一億元之資本創立，卅六年七月雖增資為法幣卡億元，而囤貨竟達如許之多，以現值從低估計，約合金圓券二千萬元以上，折合法幣六十萬億元，與其第二年資本比，約合六萬倍，要非該公司總經理孔令侃，具有特殊權勢，巧取豪奪，　能相信。核其川六年總納所得稅，僅為法幣二四點四二零點零零零零元，利得稅法幣五點零八二點四零零元，卅七年上期加六倍估繳，上二項稅額，僅為一七七點四一四點四零零元。卅五年所納營萊稅，為法幣一點八七七點九一九元，卅六年上半年怯幣二六點四九六點八零零元，卅六年下半年改納特種營業稅，查定稅額計怯幣二八點五五七點八六七元，卅七年上半年為金圓券一百三十二元四角七分，據查所得稅法規定公司營利所得，達資本百分之三百以上者，課稅百分之四十，過分利得稅怯，利得額越過資本額百分之一百二十者，按其超過額髁稅百分之二十二，該公司拒繳賬簿，無從稽攷，其眞實盈利數字，但按照其今日存貨推算，其盈餘約在其資本十億元之五六萬倍，卽假定卅六年底法幣值為今日金圓券折合法幣值二百倍，仍有二三百倍之純利，依所得稅法，盈餘百分之三百以上，及利得稅百分之一百二十合算，兩稅共繳百分之六十二計算，卽卅七年度應納法幣一千八九百億以上。該公司僅於本年五月問，照估繳一億七千七百餘萬元，納合千分之一，若追算卅五年度之盈餘，姑以百分之五（三十六年底，與卅五年度物價為二十比一）折算，上述盈餘數字百分之五十，作為三十六年之一半，當在其資本一億元之七八十倍，而應繳納者，亦不下五十億元，但其所繳納，又為法幣二千九頁餘萬元，僅及千分之五六耳，其他如特種營業稅，本年上半年，僅納金圓券一百卅二元四角七分，更可類推，其中與稅務機關有無勾結，固不可知，然該公司仗勢逃稅，則實為明顯。複查核對該公司各貨進口稅率，經查出該公司假用早期稅單而指為新進口存貨之憑證，至七八種之多，而其時間，有相距至兩年者。不但張冠李戴之事實，已成鐵案，更足證明，該公司確有走私逃稅之違怯行為。且存貨中，屬於進出口貿易辦法，禁止進口者有之，關於暫不准輸入者，亦有之，其數達二十餘種，卽據其自稱，有一部份係於卅五年十一月公布進出口貿易辦法之先進口者，然仍有十餘種，由其先報指為卅六年及卅七年進口。其破壞法令，圖謀私利，殆無疑義。</p>
<p>又查該公司存貨，類多由州五年，卅六年購進，迄今尙未拋售應市，卽如食糖，煤油，均在一年以上，自難謂為非囤積居奇之行為，且工商管理法令，曾有規定，「凡進出口商經營兩種以上之營業者，應卽分別加入各該同業公會，」及上海市倉庫檢查實施要點，規定「各進口商，應按月將指定物品之數量，進口日期，堆存倉庫地點，列表報吿該管同業公會，彙報社會局」，該公司迨至本年十月十九日止，」並未加入西藥業，顏料業，化學原料業，洋酒罐頭業，橡蹘業，紙業，脚踏車業，五金業，鐵業，華洋百貨業，玻璃業，百貨業，糖業，酒脂業，無綫電業，皮革鞋料業，等同業公會，而早已購進上列各業經營之貨品，且有大量儲存，而不供應市銷，其非法牟利，國積居奇，亦無可辯。</p>
<p>再就該公司進口汽車而論，除存利喊公司飛愛特十二輛外，尙另有飛愛特及卡地洛克汽車多輛，當向輸管會查詢時，利喊公司得悉眞情洩露，乃承認於本年四月十七日，及七月十五日兩次，向揚子建業公司購入飛愛特汽車六輛，及十二輛，是揚子建業公司除輸管會證明進口飛愛特汽車十二輛外，至少另有六輛以上之飛愛特及若干卡地洛克汽車進口，否則何從轉交與利喊公司，然該飛愛特及卡地洛克汽車，輪管會自稱未發許可證，實有走私之可能。復就該公司抄錄之外匯淸單，詳查僅有廿六年一月四日，由中國銀行付英鎊一五四零五鎊又十二先令，購進奧斯汀汽車四十九輛，此外，無飛愛特及卡地洛克汽車核准外匯之任何記錄，該飛愛特，卡地洛克汽車外匯之取得，安知非如榮鴻元之同樣套願而來，（拒繳簿籍無從追查確實）。且該揚子建業公司，對於利喊公司關係，果如前節所述，際茲國家甫獲獨立平等之今日，以名滿中外之豪門公司，竟不惜托庇外僑，利用外商名義，非法牟利，其居心更可誅。</p>
<p>此外囤積大量報紙，指為時事新報，大陸報兩家所有，主管官署未加查究，是否亦為利喊公司對於揚子建業公司汽車之盡情掩飾，頗滋疑　，蓋孔令侃與該兩家報館之關係，路人皆知，時事新報上年曾為發薪困難而罷工，而今竟能購儲如許報紙，亦復可疑。是項大量報紙，該公司實仍有假名囤積之嫌。至其以不合現行公文程式之純粹英文存貨淸單，逕送上海區經濟管制督導員辦公處，而未依式填報物資登記表，向其主管官署上海市社會局呈送，及各項文件帳册，完全用英文一節，其目無法紀，與國家體制，尤堪髮指。總之，該揚子建業公司仗勢違法，逃脫走私，囤積牟利各罪俱全，自應予以嚴懲，應卽兩請行政院轉飭工商部，吊銷工商登記證，停止其營業，至其觸犯司法部份，並應移送怯院依法究辦。（下接第七版）</p>

<h3>耶誕側影</h3>
<p>聖誔節的意義是慶祝耶穌基督的降生，凡是基督敎徒，無論中外，必定熟誠地舉行祝禱的儀式。</p>
<p>在上海，從這一天開始，更展開了冬季的狂歡，各廠家商號，不分男女老幼，不問是否基督敎徒，許多人早已準備好怎樣來迎接今年的聖誕了。</p>
<p>本來，人們到了這種歲暮年尾的時候，縱使對實際生活有所不滿，但是對於新年的來臨，總懷着一種新的希望，聖誕節可設是慶祝新年的開塲。况今年此時此地的聖誔日，千萬人都懷有斯的希冀和相同的願望，雖然大家已因不安的環境减低了熟烈的情緒。但對這一年一度的佳節，總有些歡樂的情感，幾種例行的點綴，還是未能免除。</p>
<p>近數天來，上海的商店，正紛紛忙着添備貨物，佈置櫥窗，裏面陳設了白鬚紅袍的「聖誕老人」，用棉花代表白雪的背景是多麼潔靜，綠色的冬靑樹，紅的，白的，綠的，光是櫥窗裏面的顏色，就能將這個蕭瑟的季節，顯得活潑而燦爛了。</p>
<p>這幾天的商品價格，比前幾天也約略漲上了三四成不等，商家趁這機會，抬價牟利，自然是原因之一，但市塲上突然而來的購買現象，使供求變更了它的常態，更是商品漲價的更大原因。</p>
<p>不消說，在許多商號之中，酒菜飯館和娛樂塲一所必然客滿，營業最盛，今年的「聖誔大菜」，各飯店雖然已將吿白刊登各報，並且有樂隊演奏，歌舞和技術表演之類來助興，有幾家更有「名貴贈品」送給客人，可是每客的價錢並未標明，說破了也許要令一般「窮措大」為之掃興。不過，我們還淸楚地記得，去年的聖誕大菜最高限價是法幣十二萬元，折合金圓僅有四分錢。提起來，又不禁使人感慨一番了。</p>
<p>此外，時裝店，玩具店，食品和糖果店等在聖誔節上，營業數字總是突破一年以來的紀錄。一隻網綫製的冬襪，裏面裝了幾只鉛皮叫子之類的東西，加上一隻乒乓球，幾粒糖菓，便要售十數元到幾十元。幾家大百貨公司玩具部裏，人頭擁擠，這幾天賣掉的玩具，怕沒有幾百萬元？</p>
<p>至少，市面的不景氣是暫時一掃而空了。商人個個瞇瞇笑，瞎忙一陣子，財產上平添了幾位數字。白白辛苦忙碌的却是郵局職員和郵差，信件賀片比平時多了好幾倍，簡直忙得透不過氣來。</p>
<p>在這種集中消費的節日，貧富之間的差別，更見得深刻顯明，詩云：「幾家歡樂幾家愁」，恰是確切不移的寫照。</p>
<p>面迎這一年一度的佳節，富有的固然可以盡情歡娛，貧苦的在節衣縮食，在忍受飢寒的壓迫；但是，我們相信他們都被一種綺麗的恩物吸引着生命的意志，那決不是商店櫥窗裏面的東西，而是明年的新希望！</p>
<h3>聖誕老人</h3>
<p>在冬天，一陳陣的北風，吹得人怕出門。但你假使有興的話，在街頭漫步，欣賞那商店中陳列的櫥窗，到也很不錯的。棉花裝成的雪景，鋁片軋成的小鐘，綠紙的冬靑，凑成一幅美麗的冬景。還有一個臃腫肥碩，白髮紅衣的老人，他正是在吿訴你，聖誕節快到了。老人的背上，掮着一個大包囊，裏面滿滿地裝着糖果·玩具，孩子們是最歡迎的。</p>
<p>紅衣白髮的聖誕老人，是為孩子們造出來的，本來不知道他是長還是短，是胖還是瘦。各民族在原始時代，都有各種想象中的神，聖誕老人就是從保護兒童的神中蛻化出來的。在歐洲呌「聖尼哥拉」，是一個身長面瘦，道貌嚴然的老人。移居到新大陸後，改名呌聖泰·克洛斯，身體也一天一天的發福了，變成一個騰腫的胖老頭兒。</p>
<p>據說：聖尼哥拉是一位虔誠的基督敎徒，生於三五六年，歿於四二六年。他為人和藹可親，別人遇到困難，請他幫助，他無有不答應的。有一次，正是聖誕節的前夕，隣居有一個老人，為貧病所迫，又受了劣人的引誘，想把他的親身女兒賣入娼門。這事被聖尼哥拉知道了，就用襪子裝滿了金錢，暗中送到隣居老人的枕邊。那老人在第二天早晨看到了襪十，才淸償了所有的價務。起初還不知道誰送錢來，後來方才曉得是聖尼哥拉。從此人人都知道這位慈祥的老人，等他死後，就把它尊為愛護兒童之神。</p>
<p>關於聖誕老人，又另有一種傳說。當初歐洲有許多船員，旅客，商人的保護者。每逢聖誕的前夕，從北方乘雪撬趕回來度聖誕。他們回來時，總帶了許多體物來分贈兒童。於是成了每年應有的聖誕節項目，同時造出了一個聖誕老人，那人呌聖克勞斯。</p>
<p>聖誕老人橫渡大西洋後，怎樣連形狀都改變了呢？那是美國大文豪華盛領歐文之力。歐文在「見聞錄」一書中，把聖誕老人描寫成一個魁梧的樂天派人物。接下來，莫爾在「聖誕之前夕」一書中，再詳細的描寫，設是「肥頭大耳，滾圓的壯皮，笑起來好像一個大皮球在顫動着」。漫畫家湯姆斯納斯脫，更用圖書，正式把他形像化了。於是這個肥頭大腹，白髮紅衣的老人，正式成為大家所公認的聖誔老人。</p>
<h3>巴黎聖誕景象</h3>
<p>世界花都的巴黎，再加上善於尋歡作樂的法國人，在平日的情調，已够詩情畫意了。在聖誕節，更充滿了愉快的景象。吃，喝，跳舞是巴黎街頭唯一點綴聖誕的節目。英國人愛在家中度聖誕，一叙天倫之樂。怯國人却不慣住在家中，反而出外與人同樂。所以聖誕節的巴黎街頭，人如潮湧，引吭高歌，蹁躚起舞，歌聲與樂韻相和</p>
<p>餐館中也沒有空的坐位。那裏有特備的佳餚，馥郁的美酒，供嘉實的享受。咖啡館裏，圍着聖誕樹的座客，狂飲大嚼，歡樂終宵。在大街上，還排列着許多露天小店，那裏香氣撲鼻的火鷄，顏色鮮艷的葡萄酒，使過路人看了，垂涎欲滴。</p>
<h3>馬槽</h3>
<p>取穌生下來是睡在馬槽裏的，於是馬槽和聖誕節發生了關係。</p>
<p>在天主堂中，每逢聖誕節，必有一座用紙搭成的假出，山中有個洞，洞裏安着一只馬槽，平臥着聖嬰耶穌。旁邊還有聖母，當夜去尋訪的牧童，和他的羊羣，山上裝成一幅雪景，還有冬靑，橡牙紅等冬令的花草。這馬槽，不祗紀念耶穌，倒也是具有書情詩意的一種裝飾品。</p>
<p>在聖誕夜，修士和敎反們，手中執了火把，成軍結隊地，絡續而來，環繞着馬槽做彌撒，高唱聖誕之歌，敎士穿了莊重的祭服，讀着聖經。大禮完畢後，大家拿一些馬情中的稻草返家，留作紀念。</p>
<p>據設在三三五年，羅馬大帝曾做過一隻極豪華的馬權，所用的材料是最高貴的佈置也十分美麗，可惜這隻馬槽，缺少歷史上的考證，不知道究竟精緻到如何地步。現在可考的，是一二二三年聖芳濟敎徒們朝拜白冷後，在克來焦做的馬槽，乃歷史上流傳下來的第一隻。在克來焦修道院旁的森林裏，用土塊壘成一個山洞，預備了一只馬槍，舖些稻草，聖嬰就臥在上面。旁邊還有一頭牛和一頭驢，完全像當時的光景。</p>
<p>火樹銀花　好萊嗚之聖誕夜</p>
<h3>第一張聖誕卡</h3>
<p>一八四四年，英國陶勃生，曾設計過一張聖誕卡。那張聖誕卡畫得很好。陶氏設計時，還在念書，因此得了皇家專門學校的建築獎。卡上畫些什麼？因原稿不曾印製，竟散失了。</p>
<p>在陶勃生之前，英國有個柯羅爵土，也曾有印製聖誕卡的計劃，郵是一八四三年的事。柯羅請霍斯萊代為設計。霍斯萊的工作很慢，費了兩年，才把那張聖誕卡畫好。直到一八四六年的聖誕前夕，才正式印成發售，却沒有趕在陶勃生之前。</p>
<p>霍斯萊設計的聖誕卡，是第一張聖誕卡。初次只印了五十張，一搶而空；於是絡續添印，那年一共賣去了五百張。當時的售價，是一先令。現今這張聖誕卡的代價，也不是一個小數目了。柯羅原是一個小公務員，聖誕卡的生意，引起了他的興趣，從第二年起，他開了一家書店，便以出售聖誕卡作為他的主要營業。</p>

<h3>存款兌金暫時停止以後　本市物價波動甚烈</h3>
<p>自昨日起，國家行局停止辦理存款兌換金銀後，本市各項商品價格，一致呈現戲烈波動。記者曾為此事走詢於金融管理當局，據稱：是項現象，原因有二。其一為金銀兌換暫時停止後，一般人心發生恐慌，相互哄抬所致。其二：為日來銀根鬆動，投機家趁國行奉令暫停兌換金銀後，故意扳抬所致。惟彼認為值此市民購買力薄弱，廠商實銷淸淡之際，物價之波動，必可於短時期內遏止。且國行方面，控制之物　　　，必要時仍有供　停之用，以抽緊銀根。</p>
<p>外匯移轉證盡廿四日市猛升，晨開六十三元，出口商多執　不賣，進口商爭相　吸，遂成激漲之勢，節節上升，午收六十八元，猶難買進，較廿三日漲一成以上。又僑匯牌價仍為七十元。</p>
<p>市間銀根昨日濫勢微戢。需單感股，市拆已見堅實，大致均做日拆十五元至十六元，　高廿元，亦有成交。現鈔籌碼，需要亦增，惟尙無俏象。</p>
<p>昨日以時局轉機，人心樂觀，兼又游資蠢動，各類物價一致報漲。靜寂已久之市民買風，頃因市塲報價上升，亦由靜轉動，商店門市交易倍增。惟一部份物品市塲，做價雖仍呆停，零售店標價則已掛高。</p>
<h3>受圈外物價刺激　米粉糧油均劇升</h3>
<p>食米以產地上升，因受圈外物價刺激，致形成猛力上漲，上午開出卽升，後市更趨勁烈，北市白粳開四〇〇元，薄稱開三九〇元，開後聞圈外紗布猛烈向上，致人心立刻轉堅，市價猛至四六〇元收市，較前市上升一〇〇元，後一〇五元，其地各檔食米一致升起百元左右，市氣特盛，本街猛吸。南市塲開白粳四一〇元，收市四四〇方，薄稻四六〇元，各升八十元至一〇〇元，其他各檔食米，一致轉堅八九十元。昨日兩市塲到貨九四三八石，內北市塲五二九三石五斗，南市塲四一四四石五斗。</p>
<p>麵粉</p>
<p>以本街猛吸，市價猛挺，兵船粉一九〇元，較前市猛挺四十五元，老車粉開盤一九五元，收市再出二〇〇元大關，至二〇五元收盤，挺升五十二元。其他各檔雜牌粉，亦均猛挺四五十元。鈇皮亦挺，巳超出百元關，福新大包一二四元，阜豐大包一二五元，各挺起四十元之譜。</p>

<p>食油</p>
<p>以圈外物價猛升，紛紛大量扒吸，而報戶扳持，市價一致猛挺，本廠豆油開一四〇〇元高盤，中市再堅起百元，後市仍回至一四〇〇元，較前市挺起三〇〇元，本廠生菜油銷路之活，超過豆油，開盤一三〇〇元，開後以吸納盛旺，執戶再三扳持，市價再挺至一四五〇元，較前市猛進二八〇元。靑島吉桶生仁一五〇〇元，亦猛挺四五〇元，形成空前漲勢。</p>
<h3>財部重申前令　禁止濫發本票</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕關於禁止銀錢行莊濫發本票一節，前經財政部規定：「銀錢行莊開發本票，應按照當日本票科目餘額，存放十足頭寸於中央銀行或票據交換所，其無中央銀行及票據交換所地區，亦應備有十足頭寸存庫備提，如有故違，卽予按照加細金融業務管制辦法第九倏後段之規定，嚴予懲處」。茲悉：各地銀錢行莊之遵令奉行者固多，其積久玩生故違功令者亦不少，財部菸特重申前令，嗣後各地銀錢行莊，如再有濫發本票情事，一經查獲，定予依怯嚴處，決不寬　。</p>
<h3>絲綢猛漲</h3>
<p>人絲昨日市况瘋狂上漲，央行暫停存兌黃金，金融黑市猛跳，人心刺激，業外紗布漲，買氣濃厚，喊價直上。</p>
<p>一二〇天橋晨開二四〇〇〇元，高盤喊做，高後仍多扒吸，市况再晋高峯，一度高達二五〇〇〇元，走勢極挺。後聞謠言傳設，環境利空，人心略軟，散戶止吸轉吐，市氣稍平，終以二四八〇〇元了結，勁升五四〇〇元，東洋金三馬升勢相並。</p>
<p>生絲昨日市况人心突好，外匯移轉證市價續高，黃金暫停存兌，刺激頗深，是以賣氣轉吒，更因人絲綢縀勁升，喊價飛揚。D級七八勻度白廠絲做開二五〇〇〇元，升四〇〇〇元，優級零担二四五〇〇元，亦升四千元，其餘輯里干經及普通零担等，扯升一五〇〇元至二〇〇〇元。</p>
<p>綢縀市况隨絲市激漲影響，人心亦多俏利，惟因銷路日狹，漲後脚址仍軟，美亞被面晨開一五八〇〇元喊做，各種消息利多，人心一致看好，雖在高盤開出，塲上納胃仍旺，市價一高再高，直至收市以一六五〇〇元了結，升三五〇〇〇元，其餘均帶升二成以上。，；、</p>

<h3>配合總體戰　川政五要題　擬定中心工作</h3>
<p>— 本報記者周學端</p>
<p>〔本報成都十八日航訊〕戰亂烽火，燃邊東南，再度作為『中國堪察加』的四川，在安定中披上戎裝，歲寒風凍，到處是一片戰時景象。川省參議會七次大會恰於此時，為團結朝野，共謀安川而舉行，川省府主席王陵基特在大會中，就八月來省府施政　貌，與今後應付聚急局勢的非常措施，作總括報吿，從這裏我們四川看出四川政治的全面動態。</p>
<p>田賦征借　搶運軍糧</p>
<p>川省當前要政第一是田糧，軍精民食，糧源所賴，征借配額，向居首席。今年征借總額經政院配定九百萬石，征借各半，外附征公糧二百七十萬石，積穀三百廿萬石。上次省參會核减借額為四〇五萬石，外附征文化敎育補助款四十五萬石，經省府與中央函電磋商，並經全國糧食會議決定，維持征額，借額酌减為六百十七萬石。十月開征，年底掃解，因全川今年普慶豐收，糧民復怵於國事危急，咸本愛國熱忱，踴躍繳納，迄今川東川南，一般情况均佳，收足巳逾七成，川西北平均繳解亦在五成以上。另軍糧東運及川糧接濟京滬，以渝萬為集運重點，十至十二月共集中四十餘萬大包，緊急搶運，輸出過半，年底可設法全部運出．</p>
<p>推動兵役　展開組訓</p>
<p>川政另一中心項目的役政，今年上年度配額早已募足，下年度配額七萬一千五百餘名（內渝市一千三百名），九月開徵，迄今已募足四萬五千餘名。又近奉中央緊急電令，為補充徐蚌會戰作戰部隊，提徵卅八年兵額二萬四千名，限元月完成，同時廣泛發動智識靑年從軍。兩川子弟，同仇敵愾，激於戡亂，踴躍從軍，四川兵役推動因是在原則上極多收效，完額可無問題。另配同兵役的組訓民衆，根據「川省民衆自衛組訓方案』，十月開始實施，各縣市局一律成立民衆自衛總隊，警察中隊改為常備自衛中隊，保中隊改為保分隊，迄今巳有一百卅二縣市改組完成。組訓幹部巳黴召轉業退役及在野軍官，另遴委各縣選保軍官，分別舉辦全省日衛組訓幹部訓練班，與各區各縣市分班進行訓練，並展開全川基幹自衛隊訓練，預計三個月完成，可組成二百萬精練民兵荷戈衛國。</p>
<p>緊急佈防　四大步驟</p>
<p>第四項要題是緊急佈署防務，達成安川衛國目的，共分匹大步驟：（一）全面肅淸內匪，酩合渝綏署實施西南冬防計劃，發動四期總淸剿，澈底剷滅全川大小股匪，現已次第克奏膚功。關於心腹之患的華瑩山匪變，亦已進入綏靖善後階段。（二）調配保安團隊，今年增編十個保安團，配備川北保四團駐廣元一帶，川東南保七團駐萬源，保六團駐達縣宣漢，保二團警戒華瑩山週遭地帶，其餘各團酩防成都及川西一帶。（三）搶修國防公路，動員民工畫夜趕築達廣成巴兩公路，達廣路分段緊急興工，先後元成達縣平昌·南江·廣元各段，全路正由沿棧各縣民工合力搶修中。成巴路新都，金堂·儀隴·巴中·三台各段搶修工程，夜以繼日，進度極為完美。（四）架設電訊網，最近共搶架防務電訊網計：達縣至通江綫，綿（騙）廣（元）綫，巴（中）儀（隴）綫，平（昌）巴（中）綫曁成（都）閱（中）專綫，全川電訊網已相當完備</p>
<p>中心工作　五項要政</p>
<p>至於今後配合總體戰，推行戰時政治，省府明年度施政計劃，原則是以增細軍事力量，戡平叛亂，刷新政治，安定社會，增加生產，穩定經濟為綱領。擬定十二項中心工作，計：（一）嚴密保甲組織，（二）加細自衛組訓，（三）增擴保安部隊，（四）充實軍糧調節民食，（五）如限如額改進兵役，（六）整理省縣財政，（七）充實基本敎育，（八）收容流亡學生及難民，（九）元成國防公路，（十）增加糧食生產，（十一）澈底肅淸內距，（十二）扶助自耕農，實行織士授田。這十二項中心工作歸納成五大要政，卽組訓，征糧，征兵，肅淸內匪，撫輯流亡。今年四川施敢原則是在安定中求取建設明年施政方針則是以動員完成＼戡亂，這是四川由平時邁入戰時的大轉變，從安川到建國，全川人民深切了解當前的偉大時代任務。</p>

<h3>監委對揚子公司糾舉書　（上接四版）</h3>
<p>一·本案有關官署應予糾舉者：（一）查上海市警察局，在本案未發生之前，既據經警隊員趙洪寬密報經警大隊，該大隊長程義寬，應視為檢舉行為之成立，卽應派員駐往調查，而該大隊長置之未理，（查卷無處理文件）迄至九月十九日，該員再以書面報吿，始延至廿三日始曰「可」，既未依例，同時發給出勤證，以利該員等執行調查職務，卽該員等於廿四日請求發給時亦置之不理，，其用心何在，實堪意味。又查九月廿九日，該公司以大卡早偷運貨物，被盧家灣分局發現，前此旬日間有無從經辦人員聞風而隱匿物資之處，亦不無可疑。該經警隊大隊長程義寬，於經濟管制正雷厲風行之時，經本隊隊員檢舉大量囤積，竟一再延宕，是否故意便利揚子建業公司彌縫罪嫌之處，固不可必，但其遠法失職，則關明顯。</p>
<p>警察局長兪叔平對於本案處理，亦未能積極進行，如調查簿籍單據為本案進行應有之程序，而該局始終未主動切實查對，嗣經在渭越光督同調查，經該公司無理拒絕，該局亦不根據其職權，作有效之糾正，與對一般公司行號之熊度，顯有不同。查對貨品後，所稱寄存之貨物，與大連灣倉庫指為與時事新報，大陸報共用，以及利喊公司所存汽車，否認有揚子建業公司進口者在內等等，並未資成有關方面，提供證件，及查對確實，又不如一般案件之嚴格追究。經管處十月十三日電指覆，責成該局依法處理之後，未聞該局有何措施，該局大隊長程義寬，對於本案一再延宕，竟未查察糾正。綜此數端，該局局長兪叔平，亦屬畏懼權勢，怠忽職務。</p>
<p>二，查上海市政府吳市長，對於本案原未過問，經在渭越光面促函催，始加處理，惟仍多有未當，如關於貨物進口，是否合法，及有無隱藏一節，僅憑該公司所提出之貨物存單，及海關稅單核對，並未照規定調查簿籍，及原始單據，對於貨物有無隱藏，貨物進口有無張冠李戴，何從查追究竟，薛協審篤烈於審核後，從不完備之文件中，已發現該公司有十餘種禁止進口，或暫不准予輸入之貨品，係假用計單逃稅輸入，利喊公司亦存有揚子建業公司汽車，並有未發許可證進口，及申請匯者，當時市府所主持之審核工作，實屬草率敷衍，不切實際。又如警局呈復有關於寄存物品，共用堆棧，及利喊公司否認與揚子建業公司有商業上關係各節，明明未提出憑證及切實查對，又不加以糾正與覆查。再如該公司違犯工商管理法令，及上海市倉庫檢查要點，關於加入同業公會，及按月將物品數量，進口日期，倉庫地點報吿各該有關之同業公會，彙報社會局各節，主官署理應早有查察，而市府及所屬並未予以任何處分，其他如揚子建業公司囤積貸物中，除函復將工業原料，及日用必需品，根據十一月六日經濟管制督導員辦公處規定限價供應市塲外，其餘貨品，如西藥，大部皆為日用品，經儲存一年以上，且數達二千餘箱之多，尤以其中禁止進口，及未准進進入之玻璃品，（膠質）化妝品，毛織品及洋酒等，亦復不少。該市府為本案之正當主管官署，在此全國矚目該案結果之時，復文中竟無隻字道及，實不可解。該市長吳國楨縱非曲意庇護，亦屬玩忽職務。（未完）</p>

<h3>Election of the President and Vice President of the Legislative Yuan: Commissioners Voted Enthusiastically All Day, Tong Guanxian and Liu Jianqun Elected Respectively</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 24th] After a day of effort on the 24th, the Legislative Yuan elected its new President and Vice President. Tong Guanxian was elected President with 196 votes, and Liu Jianqun was elected Vice President with 202 votes. Both received more than half of the votes of those present, leaving the next highest vote-getters far behind. The thirty-first regular meeting of the second session, held on the 24th, began at 10:00 am. The enthusiasm of the commissioners attending was unprecedented in the second session. The original President and Vice President had both resigned and therefore did not attend. Chen Guyuan was publicly recommended as chairman. First, the report matters were approved, then the resignation letters of President Sun and Vice President Chen were read and accepted. Immediately afterwards, a temporary motion proposed by Luo Heng and 33 others was discussed, requesting a change to the agenda according to Article 23 of the Rules of Procedure to proceed with the election of the President and Vice President. The commissioners held extremely divergent opinions on this matter. Zhang Daofan, Zhong Zhaoxiang, Wu Wangji, and others belonging to the Reform Club rose in opposition, arguing that commissioners who were not present had not been notified in advance and that their right to vote should not be hastily deprived. They advocated setting another date for the election, while others noted that the current session was nearing its end and that many pending cases should be dealt with quickly, so the normal agenda should be followed. However, commissioners such as Huang Yuren and Wu Hexuan from the New Administration Club and the Democratic Freedom Society argued that the motion to change the agenda had been proposed in accordance with the law, that attending the meeting was an obligation of the commissioners, and that since the meeting had reached a quorum, the election could proceed. Those who were absent had forfeited their right to vote. Since the original President and Vice President had already resigned, the positions should not be left vacant for a long time while waiting for the commissioners to arrive. An election should be held immediately. The commissioners on both sides rebuked each other, and the dispute was extremely fierce. Order in the meeting was once disrupted. At 10:20 am, the chairman put Luo Heng's temporary motion to a vote. The result was that 188 of the 302 commissioners present voted in favor, and the motion was passed. However, commissioners such as Li Yu and Zou Shuwen from the Reform Club continued to express their opposition. Li Yu advocated that the election should only proceed after the normal agenda of this session had been completed. Peng Erkang advocated holding the election on the morning of the 25th. Hu Qiuyuan advocated holding the election on the afternoon of the 25th. However, Zheng Zhenyu argued that these proposals all violated the decision of the assembly to accept Luo Heng's temporary motion to change the agenda. Bao Huaguo then suggested holding the election on the afternoon of the same day. For a time, there was a chaotic clamor on and off the podium, with each commissioner arguing his case, many shouting angrily. At 11:00 am, there was still no resolution. Seeing that order was difficult to maintain, the chairman announced a recess. When the meeting resumed at 11:10 am, Yu Lingyun proposed changing the chairman, but this was opposed by Zhang Daofan and others and failed. Chairman Chen then put four opinions to a vote: (1) hold the election on the afternoon of the 25th; (2) hold the election on the morning of the 25th; (3) hold the election on the afternoon of the same day; (4) hold the election immediately. As a result, Bao Huaguo's suggestion was approved by 226 people (out of 278 commissioners present), and it was decided to hold the election in the afternoon. After reading the mutual election method, the meeting was adjourned at 11:30 am. The meeting reconvened at 3:00 pm, still chaired by Chen Guyuan. After the secretarial staff read the election voting and vote counting methods, the election proceeded smoothly beginning at 3:20 pm. Journalists were invited into the gallery to observe. The doors of the hall were closed, and commissioners who arrived late gathered in the lounge. The final voting took place at 3:30 pm, and monitors were appointed and staff assigned to begin the vote count. Voting ended at 4:20 pm. At 5:30 pm, Chairman Chen announced the results of the vote count: 351 ballots were issued, 349 ballots were cast, including 6 blank ballots and 12 invalid ballots, leaving 331 valid ballots. Tong Guanxian received 196 votes, Li Peiji received 123 votes, Luo Heng received 3 votes, Ahemaiti Heyayi received 2 votes, and Fu Sinian, Yan Huiqing, Batu Bilige, Kong Geng, Zhao Juxu, Xiao Baoyu, Liu Piji, and others each received 1 vote. In accordance with Article 4, Paragraph 1 of the Legislative Yuan President and Vice President Mutual Election Method, Tong Guanxian had obtained more than half of the votes of those present and was elected President. The audience responded with enthusiastic applause. The voting for the Vice President election immediately continued. By 6:30 pm, the vote count was completed. 342 ballots were issued, 342 ballots were cast, including 5 invalid ballots, leaving 337 valid ballots. Liu Jianqun received 202 votes, Cheng Tianfang received 126 votes, Luo Heng received 3 votes, and Li Zheng, Aimeina, Wang Junying, Song Xianren, Bai Dacheng, and Tang Rumei each received 1 vote. Liu Jianqun was elected Vice President. The meeting adjourned with applause at 6:40 pm.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 24th] After Tong Guanxian was elected President of the Legislative Yuan, reporters asked him to express his feelings. He humbly stated: "I did not expect to be entrusted with this important task, and I feel extremely apprehensive. I will entertain everyone in the coming days to discuss in detail." The newly elected Vice President Liu Jianqun frankly emphasized two points: first, to reorganize the Secretariat to provide thoughtful service to the commissioners; and second, to promote a spirit of open democracy, so that the commissioners can fully express their political views and jointly shoulder the important legislative responsibilities.</p>
<h3>The Executive Yuan to Hold a Discussion Meeting: Broadly Discussing and Drafting Policy Guidelines, Striving for Brevity and Focusing on Practicality</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 24th] The Sun Cabinet's policy guidelines will be drafted by Sun [Ke] after convening a discussion meeting with all cabinet members in the coming days to broadly exchange opinions. However, it is heard that the main points will be similar to the content of Sun's speech at the first political affairs meeting on the day of his inauguration on the 23rd, and will be nothing more than the following: in the military sphere, to strive for a final peace, concentrate efforts, carefully plan and maintain, and work hard to achieve it. The basic principle of diplomacy is to foster friendship. In the administrative sphere, the system should be carefully reviewed and effectively improved to reduce the burden and suffering of the people. In the financial sphere, the urgent task is to reward and assist the development of rural areas and industries. In terms of local administration, to strengthen local powers and duties, and adapt to the situation, and strive to ensure that the upper-level orders can be implemented to the lower levels.

<h3>The New Minister of National Defense, Xu Yongchang, Took Office Yesterday, Former Minister He Personally Supervised the Handover</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 24th] The new Minister of National Defense, Xu Yongchang, took office at 9:00 am on the 24th. Former Minister He Yingqin personally handed over the duties and convened the staff of the Ministry and the headquarters of the Army, Navy, Air Force, and Logistics for a speech. In his speech, He encouraged them to carry forward the spirit of revolutionary will and belief, to strive hard, to unite as one, and to persevere unswervingly, and to promote and enhance it. He also introduced Minister Xu, believing that under Xu's leadership, he will certainly be able to accomplish the tasks that he himself had not accomplished during his tenure. Xu said in his speech: "Under the leadership of Minister He, the Ministry has already established a good foundation. In the future, we will naturally follow the established rules and regulations." He also encouraged all colleagues to unite and work hard to fulfill their responsibilities. The full text of the speeches of He and Xu are as follows:</p>
<p>He's Speech</p>
<p>I have been in office as Minister of this Ministry for half a year. Recalling that I returned to the country from the United States this spring to report on my work and attend the National Assembly, just when the constitutional government was established, I was ordered by the President and urged by Premier Weng and friendly colleagues to serve as the first Minister of National Defense of the constitutional government. At that time, I felt that since I had served in the military for more than 30 years, and after the victory of the Anti-Japanese War and the completion of the surrender acceptance, I had sincerely hoped to be able to temporarily relinquish my responsibilities and be released from my military post, and contribute to the country's revival and construction as a citizen. Therefore, I repeatedly declined the post of Minister of National Defense, but given the situation at that time, it was necessary for me to reluctantly take on the difficult task and work together with colleagues. Therefore, at the beginning of my tenure, I worked diligently to improve the lives of officers and soldiers and enhance the morale of the national army, hoping that after solving these two most basic requirements, the military situation would gradually improve. However, after eight years of war against Japan and three years of suppressing the bandits, the difficulties in terms of human resources, finance, and materials can be said to have increased with time. In the past six months, due to various reasons, Yingqin has failed to achieve the expected goals in many aspects and has not fulfilled his responsibilities. I feel extremely guilty. However, all comrades and officers and soldiers of the national army on land, sea, and air have worked tirelessly and assisted me in carrying out my tasks under difficult conditions. Now, at the time of parting, I must express my sincere gratitude to you all.</p>
<p>Comrades, it is undeniable that the current situation is extremely difficult. However, at the time of parting, I want to encourage you with a word, that is, to carry forward the spirit of our revolutionary will and belief. Comrades should know that since revolutionary soldiers have dedicated themselves to the country and dedicated themselves to the doctrine, then we must work harder, unite as one, and accomplish our sacred mission in order to revive the country and realize the doctrine, especially in times of crisis. Only this spirit, this will, this belief, is the foundation of our revolutionary soldiers' lives. You must persevere in this spirit, this will, this belief, and promote and enhance it, then the future of the country and the national army will be infinitely bright. Now the new Minister, General Xu Cichen, has taken office. Minister Xu presided over the Ministry of Military Affairs during the Anti-Japanese War, and after the victory, until now, he has presided over the Army University. He has had extremely rich experience and outstanding achievements in the training of senior staff and in the use of troops and combat. In the future, under the leadership of Minister Xu and Chief of Staff He, you will certainly be able to accomplish the tasks that I failed to accomplish during my tenure. This is what I am gratified about at the time of parting. As for whether I will hold public office in the future, I will certainly continue to contribute to the country as a citizen and remain consistent with my comrades in spirit. Finally, I wish Minister Xu good health and all comrades hard work.</p>
<p>Xu's Speech</p>
<p>During this reorganization of the Executive Yuan, I was ordered to take over as Minister of this Ministry. At this time, I feel a great responsibility and am extremely apprehensive. However, under the leadership of Minister He, all facilities in this Ministry have reached an excellent scale. In the future, we will naturally follow the established rules and regulations. I hope that Minister He can continue to provide guidance on the business of this Ministry at any time, and I hope that all comrades will unite and work hard to live up to the heavy trust placed in us.</p>

<h3>Foreign Reporters Arrive in Bengbu to Interview the Suppression Headquarters; Zhang Yujin Explains the Battle Situation; Continuous Rain and Snow in Northern Anhui Lead to Stalemate in the War</h3>
<p>[Our Bengbu Dispatch, 24th] London Observer reporter Donovan, Daily Express reporter Smith, Daily Mail reporter MacDonald and others arrived in Bengbu this morning by train from Nanjing. In the afternoon, they visited the Suppression Headquarters here and were answered by Major General Zhang Yujin, spokesperson for the Suppression Headquarters, regarding their various questions about the current war situation. According to Zhang, due to continuous rain and snow in northern Anhui, the war has reached a stalemate. After the Bengbu-Suxian campaign, the communist forces regrouped in three locations for reorganization. Near Woyang and Mengcheng were three columns of Liu Bocheng's forces; near Lingbi and Sixian were two columns of Chen Yi's forces; north of Guzhen and near Suxian were a total of six columns from both Chen and Liu's forces. The remaining remnants, including more than 30,000 men drawn from Liu's remnants after the Bengbu-Suxian battle, were all along the Yongcheng-Fuli area, attempting to encircle Du Yuming's forces. According to intelligence, it is estimated that the communist forces mobilized no less than 700,000 troops in the Xuzhou-Bengbu and Suxian campaigns, and currently only about 250,000 men remain, of which about 100,000 are Liu's forces and about 150,000 are Chen's forces. On the Nationalist side, General Du Yuming commands a force of 120,000 men, who are currently in the vicinity of Yongcheng and Suixikou, forming a position with a diameter of about 15 kilometers, and have been confronting the communist forces in the difficult environment caused by the bad weather in recent days. The southern front Li Yannian Corps currently has five armies, of which three are stationed in the area of the Xie River basin, with heavy troops guarding Huaiyuan and the outskirts of Bengbu, and strong forces deployed along the Jinpu Railway in northern Anhui. In response to inquiries from the United Press field reporter who originally defended Bengbu and now visited Tongyun, Zhang denied that the communist forces had crossed the Huai River with their main force. His explanation for the Suppression Headquarters' move to Chuxian was that Bengbu is now the front line, and the command structure must be moved to the rear in order to advance and retreat freely and cope with possible changes in the current situation, and that the Suppression Headquarters needs to unify command in the future. The location of Chuxian is more suitable for military operations in northern Jiangsu and northwestern Anhui. A reporter further informed him that during his two-day trip from Nanjing to Bengbu, he saw at least ten trains transporting troops south every day, carrying a great deal of supplies. Zhang replied that it was the Huang Wei Corps going to the Jiangnan area for reorganization. The reporter then asked why so many supplies had to be transported south with Huang's troops instead of being left in Bengbu for use by other units. Zhang said that this was because the Suppression Headquarters did not want to leave more supplies in Bengbu. The last question was raised by a reporter from the Daily Express, who asked: In the event of necessity, how many troops can the Nationalists mobilize in the area south of Chuxian and north of the lower reaches of the Yangtze River? Also, how many troops are currently being used by the Nationalists on the Huai River front? Zhang told him that the Nationalist forces that can be mobilized north of the Yangtze River and south of Chuxian are about 300,000 men or more, and that the Nationalist forces recently used on the Huai River front, excluding central Anhui and northern Jiangsu, are about 100,000 men (note that there are at least three armies in central Anhui and more than 70,000 men in northern Jiangsu). After Zhang finished answering the questions, Commander-in-Chief Liu Zhi immediately entered the reception room to meet with the reporters. Liu, in a frank tone, explained his feelings and hopes for the current war situation, which included two points: (1) In this campaign, the Nationalist forces did fail to coordinate properly in many aspects, resulting in the regret of not being able to wipe out all the communist forces; (2) He hopes that the Nationalist forces will launch an offensive soon to complete the task that has not yet been accomplished.</p>
<p>[Our Bengbu Dispatch, 24th] The Suppression Headquarters announced: (1) The Nationalist forces between the Xie River and Fei River area have been continuously sending out small units to patrol and search for the enemy due to the snowy weather, while the main force is taking the opportunity to reorganize on the spot. Once the weather clears up, they will continue to attack. (2) On the northern front, Du Yuming's forces are also holding their positions against the enemy due to the snowy weather, with only artillery battles taking place.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Bengbu, 24th] The Huai River battlefield has entered a state of standstill due to continuous rain and snow. It started raining here on the night of the 19th and did not stop until noon on the 22nd. Heavy snow fell again on the night of the 22nd, and by the morning of the 23rd, both banks of the Huai River had become a silver world. No aircraft activity has been seen in the sky for three days, and the movements of ground troops have also been greatly delayed. According to reports from the front, our troops crossing the Hui River are conducting a show of force search against the enemy. Only a few local communists are active between Guzhen and Suxian. Liu Bocheng's communist forces have fled to Fuyang, Taihe and other areas in the Yellow River flood zone for reorganization. There have been no major battles in the vicinity of Qinglongji, northeast of Yongcheng, for the past three days. Both sides are still holding their original positions.</p>

<h3>Editorial: The Continuing Problem of Gold and Silver Redemption</h3>
<p>The gold and silver redemption measure, which lacked thorough technical consideration, has finally been temporarily suspended due to the tragedy that unfolded. Suspension is not difficult; the difficulty lies in how to improve it.</p>
<p>Judging from the crowds of people in various places vying to redeem gold and silver, the official knew early on that it would cause accidents. Sure enough, a tragedy unfolded in this city on the 22nd. Before the bank opened, tens of thousands of people, disregarding the curfew, were vying to redeem gold and silver, turning the Bund area into a sea of people. The area around the bank was so crowded that it was impenetrable, and the military police used all kinds of methods but could not maintain order, resulting in dozens of citizens being crushed to death or injured. For one or two taels of gold or forty-nine silver dollars, they were willing to risk their own lives. This foolish idea of "wanting money more than life" is both ridiculous and pitiful. It is heard that the government still insists on its redemption policy, but wants to improve the method. In fact, at present, in addition to thinking about improving the method, it may be worthwhile to consider the problem of the redemption policy itself!</p>
<p>From the perspective of the country's economic policy, it is not wrong in principle to use the gold and silver redemption policy to contract the currency and thereby stabilize prices. The recent price increases over the past month have not been dramatic, which cannot be said to be a success of the redemption policy. Moreover, yesterday, prices generally rose by 30 to 40 percent with only one day of suspension of redemption, which shows that gold and silver redemption has indeed achieved considerable results. However, excessive currency contraction and tight credit are first and foremost harmful to the city's industrial sector. On the one hand, they feel the difficulty of capital deployment, and on the other hand, due to the weak purchasing power of the people, actual sales are sluggish, and the re-production of various factories will be in a state of stagnation. Therefore, opening up industrial loans has become a consistent demand of the city's industrial and commercial sectors, and the government has no choice but to comply in order to rescue industry. Therefore, the outflow of a large number of industrial loans will offset the effect of the redemption policy of contracting the currency. Therefore, strictly speaking, the redemption policy has almost lost its meaning in its original purpose. Looking at the disparity between the redemption price of gold and silver and the black market price, it can be seen that continuing to implement the redemption policy, if not modified at any time, will inevitably only waste the expenditure of the national treasury's gold and silver, facilitate the redemption and profit of a small number of people, and have nothing to do with the lives of the majority of people. Even if gold and silver redemption is stopped today, it is not unreasonable.</p>
<p>However, we also know that the government's handling of gold and silver redemption this time is entirely based on the principle of "taking from the people and returning it to the people," which is why they came up with this method. Therefore, even if there are now many malpractices, they still have to continue to handle it and should not "refrain from eating for fear of choking." They can only plan and improve more on the technical aspects of implementation. It is heard that the government authorities are deliberating on improving the redemption method. We only hope that if the government has any revised methods in the future, it is better to be slightly cautious and not change the order from morning to evening, rather than seeking speed and having many loopholes.</p>
<p>We would like to put forward the following points for the authorities' reference:</p>
<p>First, the government should first consider how much gold and silver will be redeemed before making a comprehensive plan. Because, if we talk about the principle of "unlimited redemption" and say that every citizen can come to redeem, and the benefits of redemption increase with the black market, then in theory, the government must prepare 100 to 200 million taels of gold. Otherwise, only people in big cities like Shanghai will redeem, and the people in the interior and countryside will not have the opportunity to enjoy the right to redeem. How can this be said to be fair? Moreover, the government only redeems and does not collect, which is even more "generous" than Song Ziwen's gold policy of secretly buying and selling. How much gold and silver can block this bottomless "gold-digging desire"?</p>
<p>Second, public education personnel and military police are all people who perform tasks for the country. The situation is so serious, how can we let them all try to raise cash to redeem gold and silver, and temporarily put their duties aside? If the government is really rich in gold and silver and is willing to plan for them, why not give them a percentage of gold and silver when paying their salaries in three months (?), so as to avoid issuing gold yuan coupons and then letting them come to redeem them, which is a waste of effort?</p>
<p>Third, the price of gold and silver redemption should not be far from the black market price, or it can be adjusted according to the market at any time. Otherwise, redeeming one tael of gold in one day can earn 1,000 gold yuan, which exceeds his monthly salary income. Who would not want to squeeze in? If you go, I will go too, and the market price of the ID card will also increase. Suddenly, tens of thousands of people will be crowded in front of the bank, which is inevitable. For those who redeem, whether they are "scalpers" or ordinary citizens, we can only express our sympathy and pity them! To prevent people from redeeming again and avoid them from "killing themselves" for profit, the only way is to adjust the price of gold and silver redemption at any time according to the market price. Then, since there is no heavy profit to be made, people will not "take risks" to make gold-digging dreams.</p>
<h3>Redemption to Resume in the Short Term; New Measures Being Studied; Xu Kan and Yu Hongjun Exchanged Views Yesterday</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 24th] After the temporary suspension of gold and silver redemption, new ways to improve redemption are being actively studied by the Ministry of Finance and the Central Bank, and it has been decided to formulate improved ways and resume redemption in the shortest possible time. On the afternoon of the 24th, Finance Minister Xu Kan and Central Bank Governor Yu Hongjun exchanged views on improving the method of redeeming deposits. On the morning of the 24th, Wu Xingzhou, Director of the Currency Department of the Ministry of Finance, and Chen Qingyu, Manager of the Beijing Branch of the Central Bank, also met again to discuss new ways to improve redemption. It is reported that the reason why the tragedy of people being crushed to death occurred in Shanghai's redemption was because the National Bank issued more redemption application forms than in other places, and each redemption applicant had a high probability of obtaining an application form. Therefore, the number of redemption applicants reached tens of thousands. To learn from past lessons, the method of issuing application forms will be properly revised.</p>
<h3>Customs Announces Limits for Passengers Carrying Gold, Silver, and Paper Money</h3>

<h3>Private Cars from the Mainland Must Be Approved for Transport to Taiwan</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Taipei, 24th] Recently, many private cars from various ports in the mainland have been transported to Taiwan. According to the authorities here, the Taiwan Provincial Government strictly enforces the central government's regulations on restricting the use of private cars.

<h3>Supervisory Committee's Indictment Against Yangzi Company (Continued from Yesterday)</h3>
<p>On November 18th, the Shanghai Municipal Government issued letter No. 1341 of the Municipal Machinery Department, briefly stating that regarding the case of Yangzi Construction Company hoarding goods, they were instructed to promptly conduct a thorough investigation of the company's books, documents, warehouses, and other storage locations, in accordance with the provisions of Article 16 of the "Implementation Guidelines for Suppressing Hoarding and Profiteering" (9). Furthermore, regarding the rumor that the company hoarded many new cars that were prohibited from being imported at the Li Han Company, they were also instructed to investigate and report back. Consequently, the Police Bureau was ordered and Councilor Lin was assigned to investigate. According to the signed report, regarding whether the goods matched the declared items, a thorough inspection was conducted at each warehouse on October 30th and 31st, and the more important goods were unpacked and checked. In addition to discovering four types of unreported goods, the rest were found to be consistent. Regarding the legality of the goods' importation, each item listed in the inventory was checked against the import customs declarations on the morning of October 30th, and it was found that all the goods had completed customs procedures and were imported after paying taxes. Regarding the hoarding of many imported small cars at the Li Han Company, it was found that the Li Han Company currently had 52 new cars and 6 new trucks approved for import by the Transportation Control Committee, as well as 7 cars stored there. Manager Ge Teli of the company testified that the company was a foreign-run business and had no commercial relationship with Yangzi Construction Company. The Police Bureau also submitted a report. Upon further review of the "Provisional Measures for Handling Industrial Raw Materials and Daily Necessities Registered in the Inventory of Yangzi Construction Company," the Shanghai District Economic Control Supervisory Office of the Executive Yuan issued letter No. Hu Jing Du Zi 886 to the Municipal Government on November 6th, stipulating that they should be supplied to the market at a limited price and requesting that the Shanghai District Materials Adjustment Committee coordinate the distribution. In addition to ordering the Social Affairs and Police Bureaus to comply and work with the Adjustment Committee to handle the matter promptly, they were also requested to take note. This is the final attitude and disposition of the competent authorities.</p>
<p>Regarding the cars stored at the Li Han Company, the report states that there are currently 40 Chevrolet and Austin cars, 12 Fiat cars, and 6 Chevrolet trucks, as well as 7 Chevrolet, Austin, and Fiat cars that have been sold but not yet picked up. However, according to the report from the Import and Export Control Committee, the company had been approved to import a total of 324 Chevrolet and Austin cars, but none of them were Fiats. The 12 Fiats listed by the company were all applied for import by Yangzi Construction Company. In addition, there were 3 luxurious Cadillac cars that were not listed. After inquiry, it was said that they belonged to Kong Xiangxi and Kong Lingkan. The statement in the Municipal Government's reply that Manager Mo Taili of Li Han Company testified that the company had no commercial relationship with Yangzi Construction Company was a lie. Upon further investigation by the Social Affairs Bureau, the Li Han Company was originally organized by British merchants in Shanghai and registered with the Hong Kong government in 1930, with a total registered capital of 1.5 million taels of silver, which was not fully paid up, or 1.2 million yuan in national currency at that time. Later, in October 1947, the registration was changed and reorganized. In addition to retaining three British directors, the remaining four original British directors were replaced by Chinese nationals Zhou Qiyong, Song Ziang, Qian Qifeng, and Li Yaosun, with Zhou Qiyong as the chairman of the board and Song Ziang once serving as the company's manager. These four individuals are all important employees of Yangzi Construction Company, such as Zhou Qiyong being the manager of the import department, Li Yaosun being the assistant manager of the import department, Song Ziang being the manager of the industrial department, and Qian Qifeng being the head of the finance department. Moreover, the capital of Li Han Company is very large, and changing more than half of the directors must involve new directors making huge investments. It is rumored that Yangzi Construction Company once acquired 80% of the shares of Li Han Company for US$750,000 to US$1 million, which is not without reason. Furthermore, the fact that the 12 Fiat cars imported by Yangzi Construction Company this year are stored at Li Han Company, while Li Han Company repeatedly and falsely denies it, makes the relationship between the two even clearer. The above is the entire situation of the re-investigation. (The following text continues on page 4)</p>

<h3>Security Council Orders Ceasefire in Dutch East Indies and Immediate Release of Indonesian President and All Political Prisoners Indonesia Establishes Government in Sumatra</h3>
<p>[This newspaper report] New York broadcast: Singapore news: The representative office of the Republic of Indonesia in Singapore announced: The Republic of Indonesia has been established in Sumatra, led by Minister of Economic Affairs, Shafiruddin.</p>
<p>[Taiwan Public News Agency, Paris, 24th] The United Nations Security Council passed a resolution today, demanding a ceasefire between Indonesia and the Netherlands. A US proposal that both sides withdraw their troops was rejected. The Security Council also resolved that the Netherlands should immediately release the Indonesian President and other political prisoners. Today, the British, American, and Soviet representatives all demanded that Dutch troops immediately withdraw from Indonesia. The British representative, Dunnin, announced his support for the American proposal, namely that both sides should immediately withdraw their troops to the positions they held before the outbreak of hostilities last Saturday. The Soviet representative, Malik, put forward another proposal, in addition to demanding troop withdrawals, also demanding the release of arrested Indonesian leaders. Furthermore, he advocated that a committee be formed by representatives of all members of the Security Council to handle this dispute and monitor the Dutch troop withdrawal. The French representative did not vote on any of the proposals in this case, because France doubted whether the Security Council had the ability to handle the Indonesian issue at all. The Dutch representative, Ballot, said: The Netherlands' "shocking atrocities" are beyond doubt, but although the Dutch country expressed sympathy for Indonesia, France's position was purely based on legal principles, because the Republic of Indonesia could not legally be regarded as a member under the Charter of the United Nations, and according to international law, Indonesia has not yet become a country. Therefore, the Netherlands' actions are domestic in nature, and the Security Council cannot interfere.</p>
<p>[United Press Agency, Paris, 24th] Today, the Security Council passed the Indonesia-Netherlands ceasefire case with seven votes in favor, zero votes against, and four abstentions. The countries that abstained were Belgium, France, the Soviet Union, and Ukraine. The vote on the troop withdrawal case resulted in five votes in favor, zero votes against, and six abstentions.

<h3>Nineteen Important Japanese War Criminals Allied Forces Intend to Release All Announce End of War Criminals Liquidation</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 24th] The Allied Forces today released all unconvicted Class A Japanese war crime suspects in Sugamo Prison this afternoon and announced that the trial of all major war criminals in Japan has ended. The war criminals released today included Okawa Shumei, who was removed from the list of defendants last year due to mental illness. Other Japanese war leaders who were very active in China before and during the war, such as Kishi Nobusuke, Kodama Hideo, Nishio Toshizo, and Ando Kisaburo, were also included.</p>
<p>Allied Forces Communique</p>
<p>All war criminals released today were originally arrested and handed over to the Far East International Military Tribunal or similar tribunals to be tried for major war crimes. In view of the actual difficulties, the Allied Forces decided to try them for Class B and Class C war crimes, namely violations of the laws and customs of war and crimes against humanity. However, the International Tribunal acquitted several defendants of Class B and Class C war crimes (whose positions in the Japanese government were similar to those of the remaining nineteen war crime suspects), which became a legal precedent and ultimately led the Allied Forces to change their original decision to try these suspects for Class B and Class C war crimes. According to the announcement made by the Allied Forces today, the above-mentioned war crime suspects had a very short time in politics, "so that their Class B and Class C crimes, if based on their responsibilities in their official positions, would be difficult to establish." The announcement today also stated that after "thorough consideration of all relevant factors," the Allied Forces decided not to initiate any further trials.</p>
<p>List of War Criminals</p>
<p>The list of the nineteen Japanese Class A war criminals released today is as follows: (1) Anno Nobuki (former Minister of Interior), (2) Ando Kisaburo (Tojo Cabinet), (3) Amano Eiji (former Foreign Minister), (4) Aoki Kazuo (Tojo Cabinet Minister of Justice), (5) Goto Fumio (former Minister of State and Minister of Interior), (6) Honda Kumitaro (former Ambassador to China), (7) Ishihara Koichiro (industrial leader), (8) Iwamura Michiyo (Tojo Cabinet Minister of Justice) (9) Kishi Nobusuke (Tojo Cabinet Minister of Commerce), (10) Kodama Hideo (notorious Japanese Navy spy in Shanghai, and leader of the Kodama organization in China), (11) Kazuo Noku (leader of the Japanese Black Dragon Society), (12) Nishio Toshizo (former Commander-in-Chief of the Japanese Expeditionary Army in China), (13) Okawa Kiyoshiaki (publisher and propagandist of extreme nationalism), (14) Kawamura Kazuyoshi (former leader of various Japanese nationalist organizations), (15) Suma Yakichiro (former Japanese Ambassador to Spain), (16) Takahashi Mitsugi (former Commander of the Japanese Naval Fleet), (17) Tani Masayuki (former Japanese Foreign Minister), (18) Terashima Ken (Tojo Cabinet Minister of Railways), (19) Tada Shun (former Commander-in-Chief of the Japanese North China Expeditionary Army).

<h3>Senate Assembly Three Important Issues How to Defend Greater Shanghai Balance Municipal Financial Budget Set Standard for Calculating Rent</h3>
<p>According to the spokesperson of the Senate, as of yesterday, more than 30 senators had completed the registration procedures with the secretariat. No formal motions have been submitted yet. It is generally expected that the three major focuses of discussion in this assembly will be local defense, budget balancing, and rent issues. The municipal budget for 1949, although compiled by the municipal government, has not yet been sent to the Senate for review. Regarding the rent issue, the Shanghai General Federation of Tenants held a rent standard review meeting yesterday, attended by more than 100 tenant representatives from various neighborhoods. After careful discussion, the final decision was that the maximum rent limit in the city would be 0.5 Gold Yuan per pre-war legal currency for residential buildings and 0.65 Gold Yuan per pre-war legal currency for commercial buildings. The calculation method for this standard is based on the original resolutions of 7,000 times and 9,000 times passed by the Senate in March of this year. After converting to Gold Yuan, it is multiplied by the mixed average multiple of the city's workers' index and public education salaries from August to December of this year. After the association decided on the above standard, it will formally suggest that the Senate adopt it in this assembly and request the relevant authorities to announce its implementation. It is also learned that after the death of Senator Shao Yongsheng, the secretary-general of the Tenants' Federation, in a plane crash, the association re-elected standing committee member Ma Junshuo as the secretary-general and Li Yushu as a standing committee member yesterday.</p>
<p>[Another News] All subordinate agencies of the Central Government stationed in various places are legally entitled to refuse to answer any inquiries from local public opinion institutions. In the past, when the Shanghai Senate held a general assembly for a long time, discussions involving central government agencies stationed in Shanghai, except for the Materials Supply Bureau and the Direct Tax Bureau, which were invited to send personnel to attend and explain, many other relevant agencies refused on various pretexts, encountering obstacles in the work of deliberation. It is learned that the Ministry of Finance, in order to take into account the actual needs of local public opinion organs for deliberation, recently ordered the Shanghai Gold Control Bureau and other subordinate agencies of the Ministry stationed in Shanghai to send personnel to attend and answer questions at any time when the Senate holds a general assembly and raises relevant inquiries.</p>

<h3>Haiji Wheel Continues Southbound Passed Xiamen Waters Yesterday</h3>
<p>[This newspaper report] The China Merchants Bureau's Haiji Wheel sailed from Shanghai to Guangzhou on the 22nd. Halfway through the journey, explosives were found on board.

However, the ship is a cargo ship, with few passengers, and there were no gangsters mixed in, so there was no danger. The General Bureau originally planned to turn back to Shanghai, but the captain believed that there was no danger, so he continued sailing south.

<h3>Allowance for Families of New Recruits to Be Raised Locally by District Guarantees; Municipal Conscription Association Explains Reasons for Separate Fundraising</h3>
<p>The public has been unclear about the collection of family allowances for new recruits by district guarantees this time, and many have written to the Conscription Association and various newspapers to inquire about the matter. It is now understood that the fundraising for the family allowance for new recruits is not handled by the Conscription Association, and the funds collected are not handed over to the Conscription Association for distribution. Instead, the district guarantees are raising funds themselves for the purpose of providing family allowances for new recruits in their respective districts. The method of collection is based on the "Key Points for Shanghai Districts to Raise and Provide Family Allowances for New Recruits" established by the Civil Affairs Bureau. It is noted that the Conscription Association collected family allowances for new recruits in the first half of the year, and recently various dance halls in the city have also been collecting family allowances for new recruits. The public may be confused by this separate fundraising by district guarantees. According to the Conscription Association, the first batch of new recruits for the 37th year [of the Republic, i.e., 1948] was planned to be 6,000. At that time, to encourage enlistment, it was decided to issue each new recruit 20 *shi* (石) of rice as a family allowance (converted and issued according to the household rice price). The municipal government announced the "Measures for Collecting Family Allowances for New Recruits in the 37th Year", and the rice (divided into five grades and converted according to the household rice price) and *fabi* (法幣, old legal tender) (divided into three grades) were assessed and collected from current servicemen and households with men of conscription age who had not been drafted. At that time, according to the assessment and collection figures of each district, it was roughly sufficient for the 6,000 new recruits. However, later, due to the continuous rise in rice prices and the inverse relationship between the collection of family allowances and the formation of new recruits (i.e., when rice prices were low, collection was more prosperous but there were fewer soldiers, and when prices were high, there were more soldiers but no collection), the collected family allowances for new recruits were completely exhausted when 3,000 new recruits were recruited. The issuance of the family allowance for new recruits started at 70 million *yuan* per person in July and increased to 300 million *yuan* per person. Later, with the currency reform, the Conscription Association tried to use the preferential treatment money for delaying conscription of strong men (special funds for preferential treatment of conscripted families) to continue the recruitment, and also increased the family allowance to 200 gold *yuan* per person. However, due to the relationship between prices, there were still no volunteers to enlist. At the same time, the city was assigned to recruit another 4,400 new recruits, adding up to 7,000 including the previous arrears. The central government was urging the recruitment urgently, and the previous family allowance had ended. Although many plans were made, none were successful. Until the beginning of November, the 26 dance halls in the city collected the money on behalf of the government through tea fees, but the amount was limited and could only maintain the number of 200 *yuan* per person, and there was no way to increase it. With only 200 *yuan* of family allowance, it was difficult to expect volunteers to join the army. The Civil Affairs Bureau, in response to the unanimous request of the district guarantees and the actual needs, promulgated self-raised subsidy measures, and each district raised family allowances separately in order to successfully recruit and complete the recruitment quota. In addition, the collection, storage, distribution, and supervision of the fundraising requirements have specific regulations. All sectors can monitor them at any time. If there are cases of corruption or fraud, they should be reported as much as possible to prevent abuses.</p>

<h3>Supervisory Committee's Impeachment Document Against the Yangzi Company (Continued from Page 2)</h3>
<p>(F) Yangzi Construction Company should be subject to suspension of business, and its judicial part should be transferred to the court for investigation.</p>
<p>(1) It is found that Yangzi Construction Company was established in April of the 5th year of the Republic [i.e., 1916] with a capital of 100 million *fabi*. Although the capital was increased to 1 trillion *fabi* in July of the 36th year [i.e., 1947], the hoarding of goods reached such a large amount. Even if the current value is underestimated, it is about 20 million gold *yuan*, equivalent to 600 trillion *fabi*. Compared with its second year's capital, it is about 60,000 times. It is hard to believe unless the general manager of the company, Kong Lingkan, has special powers and exploits by hook or by crook. The total income tax paid in the 36th year of the Republic [i.e., 1947] was only 24.420.000.000 *fabi*, and the profit tax was 5.082.400 *fabi*. The above two tax amounts were only 177.414.400 *fabi* estimated at six times in the first half of the 37th year [i.e., 1948]. The business tax paid in the 35th year of the Republic [i.e., 1946] was 1.877.919 *fabi*. In the first half of the 36th year of the Republic [i.e., 1947], it was 26.496.800 *fabi*. In the second half of the 36th year of the Republic [i.e., 1947], the special business tax was changed. The assessed tax amount was 28.557.867 *fabi*. In the first half of the 37th year [i.e., 1948], it was 132.47 gold *yuan*. According to the income tax law, if the company's profit income reaches more than 300% of the capital, 40% tax will be levied. The excess profit tax is levied at 22% of the excess amount if the profit exceeds 120% of the capital. The company refuses to submit accounting books, and there is no way to investigate. The true profit figures are unknown. However, according to the current inventory, its profit is about 560,000 times its capital of 1 billion *yuan*. Even if the value of the *fabi* at the end of the 36th year is assumed to be 200 times the current gold *yuan* equivalent *fabi* value, there is still a net profit of 2300 times. According to the income tax law, the sum of 300% or more of the profit and 120% of the profit tax is 62%. That is, the *fabi* tax payable in the 37th year should be more than 189 billion. The company only paid more than 177 million *yuan* according to the assessment in May of this year, which is only 1/1000. If the profit of the 35th year is retroactively calculated, it is assumed to be 5% (the ratio of prices at the end of the 36th year to the 35th year is 20 to 1). Fifty percent of the above profit figures are regarded as half of the 36th year, which should be 780 times its capital of 100 million *yuan*, and the amount payable is no less than 5 billion *yuan*. However, what it paid was more than 29 million *fabi*, which is only 56/1000. The special business tax in the first half of this year was only 132.47 gold *yuan*. It can be inferred from this. It is unknown whether there is any collusion with the tax authorities. However, it is obvious that the company relies on its power to evade taxes. In addition, after reviewing and verifying the company's import tax rates, it was found that the company falsely used early tax bills and pointed to them as certificates of newly imported inventory. There are as many as seven or eight types, and some have a time difference of up to two years. Not only has the fact of mislabeling become a definitive case, but it is also sufficient to prove that the company has indeed engaged in illegal smuggling and tax evasion. Moreover, among the inventories, some are prohibited from being imported according to import and export trade regulations, and some are temporarily not allowed to be imported, and there are more than 20 types. According to its own claim, some of them were imported before the import and export trade regulations were announced in November of the 35th year, but there are still more than ten types, which it first reported as imports in the 36th and 37th years. There is no doubt that it has undermined the law and sought private interests.</p>
<p>Moreover, the company's inventory is mostly purchased in the 35th and 36th years and has not yet been sold on the market. For example, sugar and kerosene have been in stock for more than a year. It is difficult to say that it is not a behavior of hoarding and speculation. Moreover, industrial and commercial management laws have stipulated that "Any importer and exporter who operates more than two types of businesses should immediately join the respective trade associations," and the Shanghai Municipal Warehouse Inspection Implementation Guidelines stipulates that "Each importer should report the quantity of designated goods, import date, and storage warehouse location to the competent trade association on a monthly basis, and report to the Social Affairs Bureau." As of October 19th of this year, the company has not joined the trade associations of Western medicine, pigments, chemical raw materials, foreign wine and canned food, rubber, paper, bicycle, hardware, iron, Chinese and foreign department stores, glass, department stores, sugar, wine and grease, wireless electricity, leather and shoe materials, and other trade associations, but has already purchased goods operated by the above industries and has a large amount of storage, but does not supply them to the market for sale. Its illegal profit-making and hoarding are also undeniable.</p>
<p>In terms of the company's imported cars, in addition to the 12 Fiat cars stored by the Li Han Company, there are also many Fiat and Cadillac cars. When inquiring with the Transportation Control Committee, the Li Han Company learned that the truth had been revealed and admitted that it had purchased six Fiat cars and twelve cars from Yangzi Construction Company twice on April 17th and July 15th of this year. That is to say, in addition to the 12 Fiat cars imported with the certification of the Transportation Control Committee, Yangzi Construction Company has imported at least six or more Fiat cars and several Cadillac cars. Otherwise, how could it transfer them to the Li Han Company? However, the Transportation Control Committee claimed that it had not issued permits for the Fiat and Cadillac cars, and there is indeed a possibility of smuggling. After reviewing the company's copied foreign exchange list, it was found that on January 4th of the 26th year [i.e., 1937], the Bank of China paid £15,405 and 12 shillings to purchase 49 Austin cars. In addition, there are no records of foreign exchange approval for Fiat and Cadillac cars. How did the foreign exchange for the Fiat and Cadillac cars come from? Isn't it the same as Rong Hongyuan's speculative trading? (Refusal to submit account books makes it impossible to investigate accurately). Moreover, if the relationship between Yangzi Construction Company and Li Han Company is as described in the previous section, in today's era when the country has just gained independence and equality, a famous and well-known company in China and abroad does not hesitate to seek refuge with foreigners and use the name of foreign businessmen to make illegal profits. Its intention is even more punishable.</p>
<p>In addition, hoarding a large number of newspapers, claiming to be owned by *Shishi Xinbao* [Current Affairs News] and *Dalu Bao* [Mainland News], the competent authorities have not investigated, whether it is also Li Han Company's full cover-up for Yangzi Construction Company's cars, which is quite suspicious. After all, the relationship between Kong Lingkan and the two newspapers is well known. *Shishi Xinbao* went on strike last year due to difficulty in paying wages, but now it can purchase and store so many newspapers, which is also suspicious. The company is still suspected of hoarding under a false name for this large number of newspapers. As for its submission of an inventory list in pure English that does not conform to the current official document format directly to the Shanghai District Economic Control Supervisor's Office without filling out the material registration form and submitting it to its competent authority, the Shanghai Municipal Social Affairs Bureau, and the fact that all documents and account books are in English, its disregard for law and national system is particularly outrageous. In short, Yangzi Construction Company relies on its power to violate the law, and its crimes of evading smuggling, hoarding, and making profits are all complete. It should be severely punished. It should immediately request the Executive Yuan to order the Ministry of Industry and Commerce to revoke its industrial and commercial registration certificate and suspend its business. As for the part that violates the judiciary, it should be transferred to the court for investigation in accordance with the law. (Continued on Page 7)</p>

<h3>Liu Hongsheng, Chairman of China Merchants Bureau, Resigns</h3>
<p>Xu Xueyu Visited Beijing Yesterday to Ask for Instructions</p>
<p>Liu Hongsheng, Chairman of China Merchants Bureau Shipping Company and Chairman of the Ningbo Association in Shanghai, resigned because of the unfortunate sinking of the China Merchants Bureau's Jiangya steamer this time, which resulted in thousands of deaths and created an unprecedented tragedy in the history of China's shipping industry. Moreover, most of the passengers were fellow Ningbo natives, so the Ningbo Association was in charge of the aftermath. Liu was also the person in charge of both parties and felt quite difficult. Recently, the matter of lawyer Wang Peiji caused a misunderstanding between the China Merchants Bureau and the Ningbo Association. Liu formally submitted his resignation to the Board of Directors of China Merchants Bureau to avoid being caught in the middle. It is learned that Xu Xueyu, General Manager of China Merchants Bureau, went to Beijing on the 24th to report the recent business situation to Minister Yu of the Ministry of Communications and asked the Ministry of Communications for instructions on Liu's resignation.</p>

<h3>Forged Cigarette Trademark Tax Stamps: Eight Arrested, Interrogated, and Sentenced</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Hu Xin Da, who worked as a seal engraver, plotted illegal profits and was instigated by broker Zou Ji Gen to forge trademark steel stamps for cigarettes of brands such as Qianmen and British American Tobacco, selling them to others for the purpose of counterfeiting trademarks. He was also entrusted by broker Zhang Rui Xiang to forge trademark steel stamps for cigarettes of brands such as San Paotai, British American Tobacco, and Qianmen. Zhang Rui Xiang also bought from Chen Guang Hui, a small factory worker, 2,500 pieces of San Paotai cigarette raw materials that were stolen from the Yizhong Tobacco Company by the fugitive Wu Dao and hidden at Chen's place, and then transferred them to Zou to be sold to Zhang Qi Liang, who was aware of the situation. He then resold them to Jiao Wen Xiu and Zhao Tian Xiang. In addition, Zou Ji Gen forged Bank brand cigarette cases and instigated Chen Rui Sheng and the fugitive Xie Wei Hao to forge cigarette tax stamps, and hid a roll of forged cigarette tax stamps and a package of forged Bank brand cigarette cases at Zhang Qi Liang's place. After police investigation, a forged San Paotai cigarette trademark steel stamp was quickly found at Hu Xin Da's place. A small package of San Paotai cigarette soft packs, six stacks of cigarette tin foil, a small amount of cellophane, five stacks of cigarette small seals, and a stack of cigarette head paper were found at Jiao Wen Xiu and Zhao Tian Xiang's place. A roll of forged cigarette tax stamps was found at Zhang Qi Liang's place. A lithographic plate used to forge cigarette tax stamps and a roll of forged cigarette tax stamps were found at Xie Wei Hao's home. All were transferred to the District Procuratorate for investigation.

A public prosecution was filed with the District Court. After several trials by Judge Ou Sheng He of the District Court, the verdict was announced yesterday: Hu Xin Da was sentenced to three months of imprisonment for continuous forgery of seals; Zou Ji Gen was sentenced to three months of imprisonment for being a receiver of stolen goods, two months of imprisonment for deceiving others and forging registered trademarks, and three months of imprisonment for instigating the forgery of stamp tax tickets, to be served concurrently for a total of six months; Zhang Rui Xiang was sentenced to three months of imprisonment for instigating the forgery of seals and three months of imprisonment for knowingly trading stolen goods, to be served concurrently for a total of four months; Chen Guang Hui was fined 500 yuan for harboring stolen goods; Jiao Wen Xiu, Zhao Tian Xiang, and Zhang Qi Liang were each fined 500 yuan for knowingly buying stolen goods; Chen Rui Sheng was sentenced to three months of imprisonment for helping to forge stamp tax tickets.

<h3>Christmas Sketches</h3>
<p>The meaning of Christmas is to celebrate the birth of Jesus Christ. All Christians, whether Chinese or foreign, will sincerely hold prayer ceremonies.</p>
<p>In Shanghai, from this day onwards, a winter carnival is launched. Manufacturers and businesses, regardless of men, women, old, or young, and regardless of whether they are Christians or not, many have already prepared how to welcome this year's Christmas.</p>
<p>Originally, when people reach the end of the year, even if they are dissatisfied with their actual lives, they always have a new hope for the coming of the new year. Christmas can be said to be the opening of the celebration of the new year. Moreover, at this time and place this year, tens of millions of people have similar hopes and wishes, although everyone's enthusiasm has been reduced due to the unstable environment. But for this annual festival, there are always some joyful emotions, and several routine decorations are still unavoidable.</p>
<p>In recent days, Shanghai's shops have been busy adding goods and decorating their shop windows. Inside, there are "Santa Claus" with white beards and red robes, and the background of cotton representing white snow is so clean and quiet. The green holly trees, red, white, and green, just the colors inside the shop windows can make this bleak season appear lively and brilliant.</p>
<p>The prices of goods these days are also roughly 30-40% higher than in the previous days. Merchants taking advantage of this opportunity to raise prices for profit is naturally one of the reasons, but the sudden buying phenomenon in the market, which has changed the normal state of supply and demand, is an even greater reason for the rise in commodity prices.</p>
<p>Needless to say, among the many businesses, restaurants and entertainment venues are inevitably full and have the most prosperous business. The "Christmas dinner" this year, although various hotels have published advertisements in various newspapers and have musical performances, singing and dancing, and technical performances to help, and some even have "valuable gifts" for guests, the price per guest is not specified, and it may be disappointing for the general "poor scholars." However, we still clearly remember that the highest price limit for last year's Christmas dinner was 120,000 法币, which was only four cents in gold yuan. When I mention it, I can't help but feel a little emotional.</p>
<p>In addition, fashion stores, toy stores, food and candy stores always break the annual sales records on Christmas. A net-woven winter sock filled with a few lead toys and other things, plus a ping-pong ball and a few candies, sells for tens of yuan to dozens of yuan. In the toy departments of several large department stores, the crowds are dense. How many millions of yuan worth of toys have been sold in the past few days?</p>
<p>At least, the economic downturn in the market has been temporarily swept away. Merchants are all smiling and busy for a while, adding a few digits to their wealth. However, it is the postal workers and postmen who are busy for nothing. The number of letters and greeting cards is several times higher than usual, and they are simply too busy to breathe.</p>
<p>In this concentrated consumption festival, the difference between rich and poor is even more profoundly evident. The poem says: "Some are happy, some are sad," which is an accurate portrayal.</p>
<p>Facing this annual festival, the rich can of course enjoy themselves to the fullest, while the poor are economizing on food and clothing and enduring the oppression of hunger and cold; but we believe that they are all attracted by a beautiful gift that strengthens the will to live, which is definitely not the things in the shop windows, but the new hope for next year!</p>
<h3>Santa Claus</h3>
<p>In winter, a gust of north wind makes people afraid to go out. But if you are interested, it is also very good to stroll down the street and admire the shop windows. The snow scenes made of cotton, the small clocks made of aluminum sheets, and the green paper holly trees make up a beautiful winter scene. There is also an obese, white-haired, red-clothed old man who is telling you that Christmas is coming soon. The old man is carrying a large bag full of candy and toys, which are most welcome to the children.</p>
<p>The red-clothed, white-haired Santa Claus was created for children. Originally, no one knew whether he was tall or short, fat or thin. In primitive times, all ethnic groups had various imagined gods. Santa Claus evolved from the gods who protected children. In Europe, he is called "Saint Nicholas," who is a tall, thin-faced, and dignified old man. After moving to the New World, he was renamed Saint Santa Claus, and his body became fatter and fatter day by day, becoming a bloated fat old man.</p>
<p>It is said that Saint Nicholas was a devout Christian who was born in 356 AD and died in 426 AD. He was kind and approachable. When others encountered difficulties and asked him for help, he always agreed. Once, on the eve of Christmas, an old man next door was forced by poverty and illness and was tempted by villains to sell his own daughter into prostitution. When Saint Nicholas learned about this, he filled socks with money and secretly sent them to the old man's bedside. The next morning, the old man saw the socks and paid off all his debts. At first, he didn't know who sent the money, but later he realized that it was Saint Nicholas. From then on, everyone knew about this kind old man, and after his death, he was revered as the god who loves children.</p>
<p>There is another legend about Santa Claus. In the beginning, Europe had many protectors of sailors, travelers, and merchants. Every Christmas Eve, they would return from the north on sleds to celebrate Christmas. When they returned, they always brought many gifts to distribute to the children. This became an annual Christmas item, and at the same time, a Santa Claus was created, who was called Saint Claus.</p>
<p>After Santa Claus crossed the Atlantic Ocean, how did even his shape change? That was thanks to the American writer Washington Irving. In his book "A History of New York," Irving described Santa Claus as a burly, optimistic figure. Next, Moore described him in detail in his book "A Visit from St. Nicholas," saying that he was "fat and chubby, with a round belly, and laughing like a big ball shaking." Cartoonist Thomas Nast even formalized his image with books. As a result, this fat, white-haired, red-clothed old man officially became the Santa Claus recognized by everyone.</p>
<h3>Christmas Scenes in Paris</h3>
<p>Paris, the world's capital of flowers, coupled with the pleasure-loving French, already has enough poetic and picturesque atmosphere in peacetime. On Christmas, it is even more full of pleasant scenes. Eating, drinking, and dancing are the only programs that decorate Christmas in the streets of Paris. The British love to spend Christmas at home, enjoying family fun. The French, however, are not used to staying at home, but instead go out to enjoy themselves with others. Therefore, the streets of Paris on Christmas are crowded with people, singing loudly, dancing gracefully, and the sound of songs and music harmonize.</p>
<p>There are no empty seats in the restaurants. There are special delicacies and fragrant wines for everyone to enjoy. In the cafes, the guests surrounding the Christmas tree are drinking and eating heartily, enjoying the night. On the streets, there are also many open-air shops, where the fragrant turkeys and brightly colored wines make passers-by drool.</p>
<h3>Manger</h3>
<p>Jesus was born and slept in a manger, so the manger is related to Christmas.</p>
<p>In Catholic churches, every Christmas, there must be a fake mountain made of paper, with a cave in the mountain. In the cave, there is a manger with the baby Jesus lying flat. Next to it are the Virgin Mary, the shepherds who came to visit that night, and his flock of sheep. The mountain is decorated with a snow scene, as well as winter flowers and plants such as holly and oak teeth red. This manger is not only to commemorate Jesus, but also a kind of decoration with poetic and artistic meaning.</p>
<p>On Christmas Eve, monks and believers, holding torches in their hands, come in groups to surround the manger and hold Mass, singing Christmas carols. The priests wear solemn vestments and read the Bible. After the Mass is over, everyone takes some straw from the manger home as a souvenir.</p>
<p>It is said that in 335 AD, the Roman Emperor made a very luxurious manger. The materials used were the most noble and the arrangement was very beautiful. Unfortunately, this manger lacked historical research, and it is unknown how exquisite it was. What is now verifiable is the manger made by the Franciscan monks in 1223 AD after they visited Bethlehem in 克来焦, which is the first one that has been handed down in history. In the forest next to the 克来焦 monastery, a cave was built with earth blocks, and a manger was prepared, covered with straw, and the baby Jesus lay on it. There was also a cow and a donkey next to it, just like the scene at that time.</p>
<h3>Hollywood Christmas Eve with Dazzling Lights and Decorations</h3>
<h3>The First Christmas Card</h3>
<p>In 1844, Englishman Dobson designed a Christmas card. The Christmas card was well drawn. Dobson was still in school when he designed it, so he won the architecture award from the Royal Specialized School. What was drawn on the card? Because the original manuscript was never printed, it was lost.</p>
<p>Before Dobson, an Englishman named Cole also had a plan to print Christmas cards. That was in 1843. Cole asked Horsley to design it for him. Horsley worked very slowly, and it took two years to finish the Christmas card. It was not officially printed and sold until Christmas Eve in 1846, but it did not catch up with Dobson.</p>
<p>The Christmas card designed by Horsley was the first Christmas card. Only fifty copies were printed for the first time, and they were sold out. So they continued to print more, and a total of five hundred copies were sold that year. The price at that time was one shilling. The price of this Christmas card today is not a small amount either. Cole was originally a small civil servant. The Christmas card business aroused his interest, and from the second year onwards, he opened a bookstore and made selling Christmas cards his main business.</p>

<h3>After Temporary Suspension of Gold Conversion Deposits, Prices in the City Fluctuate Violently</h3>
<p>Since yesterday, after the national banks suspended the exchange of deposits for gold and silver, the prices of various commodities in the city have shown violent fluctuations. The reporter inquired about this matter with the financial management authorities, who said that there were two reasons for this phenomenon. One was that after the temporary suspension of gold and silver exchange, there was panic among the general public, which led to mutual price increases. The second was that the money supply has been easing in recent days, and speculators have deliberately raised prices after the national banks were ordered to suspend the exchange of gold and silver. However, they believe that given the weak purchasing power of citizens and the low sales volume of manufacturers, price fluctuations can be curbed in a short period of time. Moreover, the national banks have goods under control, and they can still be supplied when necessary to tighten the money supply.</p>
<p>The foreign exchange transfer certificate rose sharply on the 24th. It opened at 63 yuan in the morning. Many exporters held on to their holdings and refused to sell, while importers scrambled to absorb them, resulting in a sharp rise. It rose section by section and closed at 68 yuan at noon, still difficult to buy, up more than 10% compared with the 23rd. The remittance exchange rate is still 70 yuan.</p>
<p>The money market in the city yesterday curbed the abuse of power slightly. The demand for single shares was felt, and the interbank lending rate was solid, generally doing daily lending at 15 yuan to 16 yuan, or as high as 20 yuan, and transactions were also made. The demand for cash chips has also increased, but there are no signs of briskness.</p>
<p>Yesterday, due to the turnaround in the situation and optimistic public sentiment, coupled with the stirring of idle funds, the prices of all kinds of commodities rose across the board. The long-silent buying spree of citizens has also turned from static to dynamic due to the rising prices in the market, and the number of transactions in stores has doubled. However, although the prices in some commodity markets are still stagnant, the prices in retail stores have been raised.</p>
<h3>Stimulated by Out-of-Circle Prices, Rice Flour, Grain and Oil Rose Sharply</h3>
<p>The price of rice rose sharply due to rising prices in the producing areas and being stimulated by out-of-circle prices. It opened up in the morning and rose immediately, and the market was even more fierce in the afternoon. The Northern City 白粳 opened at 400 yuan, and 薄称 opened at 390 yuan. After opening, it was heard that the out-of-circle gauze was rising sharply, which immediately turned people's hearts firm. The market price rose sharply to 460 yuan at the close, up 100 yuan from the previous market, and the latter was up 105 yuan. The prices of other grades of rice in the area rose by about 100 yuan across the board. The market atmosphere was particularly strong, and 本街 absorbed fiercely. The 南市塲 opened at 白粳 410 yuan and closed at 440 yuan, and 薄稻 460 yuan, each up 80 yuan to 100 yuan. Other grades of rice were all turned firm by 80-90 yuan. Yesterday, 9,438 stones of goods arrived in the two markets, of which 5,293 stones and five斗 arrived in the 北市塲 and 4,144 stones and five斗 arrived in the 南市塲.</p>
<p>Flour</p>
<p>The market price rose sharply due to the fierce absorption in 本街. 兵船粉 was 190 yuan, up 45 yuan from the previous market. 老車粉 opened at 195 yuan and closed at 205 yuan, rising 52 yuan. The prices of other grades of miscellaneous brand flour also rose sharply by 40-50 yuan. 鈇皮 also rose, exceeding the 100-yuan mark. 福新大包 was 124 yuan, and 阜豐大包 was 125 yuan, each rising by 40 yuan.</p>
<p>Grains</p>
<p>Rose sharply across the board, and transactions were brisk. Soybeans rose by 60 yuan, corn also rose by 60 yuan, Hankou 乍豆 was 255 yuan, Huangdu corn was 240 yuan, red grain rose by 35 yuan, raw peanuts rose sharply by 70-80 yuan, and sesame opened strongly, with Jiujiang black sesame at 410 yuan.</p>
<p>Edible Oil</p>
<p>Due to the sharp rise in out-of-circle prices, there was a lot of picking up, and the reporting households held on. The market price rose sharply across the board. The opening price of 本廠 soybean oil was a high of 1,400 yuan. The price in the Central Market rose by another 100 yuan, and the price still returned to 1,400 yuan in the afternoon market, up 300 yuan from the previous market. The sales of 本廠 rapeseed oil were more active than soybean oil. The opening price was 1,300 yuan, and after opening, due to the strong absorption, the holding households repeatedly held on. The market price rose again to 1,450 yuan, up 280 yuan from the previous market. Qingdao 吉桶 raw peanuts were 1,500 yuan, also rising sharply by 450 yuan, forming an unprecedented surge.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Finance Reiterates Previous Order Prohibiting Indiscriminate Issuance of Promissory Notes</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Regarding the prohibition of silver houses from indiscriminately issuing promissory notes, the Ministry of Finance previously stipulated: "Silver houses issuing promissory notes should deposit 100% of the balance of the promissory note subject on that day in the Central Bank or the check clearing house. In areas without a Central Bank and a check clearing house, they should also have 100% of the funds in the treasury for withdrawal. Those who violate the regulations will be severely punished in accordance with the provisions of the latter part of Article 9 of the Detailed Financial Business Control Measures." It is understood that while many silver houses in various places are complying with the order, there are also many who have been violating the regulations for a long time. The Ministry of Finance has specifically reiterated the previous order, and if silver houses in various places are found to be indiscriminately issuing promissory notes again in the future, they will be severely punished and will not be lenient.</p>
<h3>Silk Rises Sharply</h3>
<p>Yesterday's silk market was crazy, with the Central Bank temporarily suspending the exchange of gold, the black market for finance jumping sharply, and public sentiment stimulated. The prices of gauze outside the industry rose, buying was strong, and prices were shouted upwards.</p>
<p>The opening price of 120 天橋 in the morning was 24,000 yuan, a high price. After the high price, there was still a lot of picking up, and the market rose to a new high, once reaching 25,000 yuan, and the trend was extremely firm. Later, rumors spread that the environment was unfavorable, and public sentiment was slightly softer. Retail investors stopped absorbing and turned to spitting out, and the market atmosphere was slightly calmer. It finally ended at 24,800 yuan, a sharp increase of 5,400 yuan. The rise of 東洋金三馬 was similar.</p>
<p>Yesterday's raw silk market was unexpectedly good. The market price of foreign exchange transfer certificates continued to rise, and the temporary suspension of gold exchange had a profound stimulation. As a result, the selling atmosphere turned into a state of being in charge, and because the prices of man-made silk and silk fabric rose sharply, the asking prices soared. The opening price of D-grade 78-evenness white factory silk was 25,000 yuan, up 4,000 yuan. The opening price of superior-grade零担 was 24,500 yuan, also up 4,000 yuan. The prices of other 輯里干经 and ordinary零担 also rose by 1,500 yuan to 2,000 yuan.</p>
<p>The silk fabric market was affected by the sharp rise in the silk market, and public sentiment was also mostly lively. However, because the sales channels were narrowing day by day, the base was still soft after the price increase. The morning opening price of 美亞被面 was 15,800 yuan. With various favorable news, public sentiment was unanimously optimistic. Although the opening price was high, the absorption in the market was still strong. The market price rose higher and higher until it closed at 16,500 yuan, up 3,500 yuan. The prices of the remaining fabrics all rose by more than 20%.</p>
<h3>Sugar Rises Sharply</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market rose across the board due to the simultaneous rise in out-of-circle prices and the stimulation of public sentiment. The bulls took the opportunity to raise prices, agitating the actual situation, and the prices of various grades rose across the board.</p>
<p>The price of four or five carloads of white refined sugar after the opening was set, and the prices repeatedly reached new highs, reaching a maximum of 850 yuan. After the high price, floating scattered gains were realized, and the market saw a slight decline, closing at 830 yuan, up 190 yuan. The price of coarse sand closed at 800 yuan, also up 205 yuan. The prices of the remaining grades all rose by more than 30%.</p>
<h3>Tea Market Shows Excellence</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the tea market trend showed a show of excellence, and the market continued to increase. The reason was that the prices of various commodities outside the market rose sharply, and the funds of the industry were extremely loose. Therefore, the cargo owners were all holding on to their holdings and were reluctant to let go easily. The export boxed tea, with the foreign exchange certificate matching the export price, had a strong buying atmosphere, and especially the green teas such as 针眉 and 秀眉 were in a hurry to catch the ship schedule, and the demand was even stronger, which led to a sudden imbalance in the supply and demand in the market, and it was seen to be prosperous. As for the domestic sales of fancy teas, they were also raided and purchased by 本街 and other places, and the market therefore rose sharply.</p>
<h3>Tung Oil Advances to New Highs</h3>
<p>After the holding households raised the price of tung oil, the market was firm at the beginning of the morning. After a while, the rising wind was still surging and unstoppable, creating an unprecedented peak. The reason was that the 足度 white oil, which was mainly for export, was rising rapidly in the foreign exchange transfer certificate, and there was also an export ship schedule on the 28th of this month. Therefore, foreign firms were absorbing it, and public sentiment became more and more expensive. The market rose rapidly and straight up. As for 青油, the paint gangs in 本街 also dragged and advanced, and the situation was firm. However, the buying atmosphere of Hongjiang tung oil was still narrow, and the market followed suit.</p>
<h3>Hearts Unusually Elated, Cotton Yarn Prices Surge, Cloth Profiting from Strong Buying Sentiment</h3>
<p>Yesterday morning, stimulated by the suspension of gold deposit exchange, people's hearts were even more elated, and the buying sentiment became stronger. Local customers reached out very frequently, and short covering was frantic, causing market prices to soar.</p>
<p>42-count Blue Phoenix rose from 270,000 yuan to 290,000 yuan, resulting in a sharp increase of 6,000 yuan compared to the previous day. Other brands such as Baoguang and Jincheng also surged by about 6,000 yuan. 40-count Blue Phoenix rose by 5,000 yuan, and 32-count Silver Moon rose by 4,500 yuan, reaching a new price of 22,500 yuan.</p>
<p>20-count Double Horse opened at 19,300 yuan in the morning, reaching a high of 21,000 yuan at one point, and closed at 20,200 yuan at noon, a rise of 3,000 yuan. Warehouse receipts were also raised to 19,100 yuan. 20-count Double Horse closed at 17,900 yuan, up 3,000 yuan from the previous day. Other brands such as Golden Rooster and Heavenly Maiden also surged rapidly towards new highs. All grades of coarse yarn below 16-count rose by 20% to 30%.</p>
<p>The cotton cloth market was boosted by favorable news. Coupled with the intense activity of goods from outside the customs area, those holding inventory felt psychologically uplifted. Various parties also considered taking action, vigorously pushing up prices. Buying sentiment was strong, and powerful retail investors and customers were still actively buying, driving the upward trend further.</p>
<p>The leading fine cloth market saw very tight inventories, and the market was exceptionally brisk. After breaking through 600 yuan, the momentum was unstoppable, reaching a new high of 750 yuan at one point. Near noon, many retail investors took profits, and the market closed at 705 yuan, a sharp jump of 135 yuan compared to the previous day. Average prices for mid-range fine cloth rose by about 100 yuan each.</p>
<p>Four Gentlemen Yuan Serge opened at 640 yuan initially, fell to a low of 635 yuan at one point, and then soared, reaching a high of 710 yuan. The market closed slightly lower at 690 yuan at noon, a sharp increase of 130 yuan. Golden Lotus Wonderful Dance Yuan Serge was at 670 yuan, an increase of 115 yuan. Four Gentlemen Yuan Twill also rose to 115 yuan, closing at 690 yuan. Other brands such as 190 Shilin and Floral Serge also rose by 100 yuan to 200 yuan. It was heard in the afternoon that the leading brand was priced at around 750 yuan.</p>

<h3>Coordinating with Total War, Five Major Themes of Sichuan Politics, Formulating Core Work</h3>
<p>— Our Correspondent Zhou Xueduan</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper Chengdu Eighteenth Dispatch] With the flames of war burning in the Southeast, Sichuan, once again acting as "China's Kamchatka," has put on military attire amidst stability. In the freezing cold of winter, a wartime scene can be seen everywhere. The Seventh Conference of the Sichuan Provincial Assembly is being held at this time to unite the government and the public and jointly plan for the security of Sichuan. Wang Lingji, Chairman of the Sichuan Provincial Government, gave a comprehensive report to the conference on the government's administration since August and the extraordinary measures to cope with the urgent situation in the future. From this, we can see the overall dynamics of Sichuan politics.</p>
<p>Land Tax Collection, Rushing Military Grain</p>
<p>The first priority of Sichuan's current political affairs is land and grain. The army relies on grain, and the people rely on food. The quota for collection and borrowing has always been the top priority. This year, the total amount of collection and borrowing allocated by the Executive Yuan is 9 million shi, half for collection and half for borrowing, plus 2.7 million shi for public grain and 3.2 million shi for grain storage. The last Provincial Assembly reduced the borrowing quota to 4.05 million shi, plus 450,000 shi for cultural and educational subsidies. After consultations between the provincial government and the central government via letters and telegrams, and after the decision of the National Grain Conference, the collection quota was maintained, and the borrowing quota was reduced to 6.17 million shi. The collection began in October and will be completed by the end of the year. Because Sichuan as a whole has had a bumper harvest this year, and the grain farmers are fearful of the national crisis, they have enthusiastically paid taxes out of patriotic fervor. So far, the general situation in eastern and southern Sichuan is good, with over 70% of the quota already collected. The average collection in northwestern Sichuan is also above 50%. In addition, military grain is being transported eastward and Sichuan grain is being supplied to Beijing and Shanghai, with Chongqing and Wanxian as the focus of concentration and transportation. A total of more than 400,000 large packages have been concentrated from October to December for emergency transportation, with more than half already shipped out. Efforts will be made to ship all of them by the end of the year.</p>
<p>Promoting Conscription, Launching Organization and Training</p>
<p>Another central item of Sichuan's political affairs is conscription. The quota for the last fiscal year was already fully recruited. The quota for the next fiscal year is more than 71,500 people (including more than 1,300 in Chongqing City). Conscription began in September, and more than 45,000 people have been recruited so far. Recently, an emergency telegram was received from the central government to supplement the troops fighting in the Xuzhou-Bengbu Campaign, requesting the conscription of more than 24,000 people from the 38th year, to be completed by January. At the same time, intellectual youths are being widely mobilized to join the army. The sons of Sichuan, with a shared hatred of the enemy and inspired by the suppression of the rebellion, are enthusiastically joining the army. Therefore, the promotion of conscription in Sichuan has been very effective in principle, and there should be no problem in meeting the quota. In addition, in coordination with conscription, the organization and training of the people is being carried out. According to the "Sichuan Provincial People's Self-Defense Organization and Training Plan," it began to be implemented in October. People's Self-Defense Brigades have been established in all counties and cities, police squadrons have been changed to regular Self-Defense Squadrons, and security squadrons have been changed to security platoons. So far, reorganization has been completed in 132 counties and cities. Cadres for organization and training have been recruited from discharged and retired military officers, and military officers selected from various counties and guarantees have been commissioned. Provincial training classes for Self-Defense Organization and Training Cadres and county and city classes have been held separately, and training for basic Self-Defense Teams throughout Sichuan has been launched. It is expected that in three months, 2 million well-trained militiamen can be formed to defend the country with weapons.</p>
<p>Emergency Deployment, Four Major Steps</p>
<p>The fourth key topic is the emergency deployment of defense to achieve the goal of securing Sichuan and defending the country, which is divided into four major steps: (1) Comprehensive suppression of internal bandits. In conjunction with the Chongqing-Sui Garrison Command, the Southwest Winter Defense Plan is being implemented, launching four phases of general suppression to completely eliminate large and small bandit gangs throughout Sichuan. Significant progress has been made in stages. The bandit rebellion in Huaying Mountain, a major concern, has also entered the stage of pacification and aftermath. (2) Allocation of security regiments. This year, ten security regiments have been added. The Fourth Security Regiment of northern Sichuan is stationed in the Guangyuan area, the Seventh Security Regiment of southeastern Sichuan is stationed in Wanyuan, the Sixth Security Regiment is stationed in Dazhou and Xuanhan, and the Second Security Regiment is guarding the area around Huaying Mountain. The remaining regiments are defending Chengdu and the western Sichuan area. (3) Rushing to repair national defense highways. Laborers are mobilized day and night to rush to build the Dazhou-Guangyuan and Chengdu-Bazhong highways. Emergency construction is underway in sections of the Dazhou-Guangyuan highway, and sections in Dazhou, Pingchang, Nanjiang, and Guangyuan have been completed successively. Laborers from counties along the road are working together to rush to repair the entire road. The emergency repair projects in Xindu, Jintang, Yilong, Bazhong, and Santai sections of the Chengdu-Bazhong road are progressing perfectly day and night. (4) Setting up a telecommunications network. Recently, the following defense telecommunications networks have been rushed to set up: Dazhou to Tongjiang line, Mianyang (misspelled as Pian) to Guangyuan line, Bazhong to Yilong line, Pingchang to Bazhong line, and Chengdu to Yuezhong special line. The telecommunications network throughout Sichuan is now relatively complete.</p>
<p>Core Work, Five Major Political Affairs</p>
<p>As for the future, in order to coordinate with the overall war and promote wartime politics, the provincial government's policy plan for the next year is based on the principles of increasing military strength, suppressing rebellion, reforming politics, stabilizing society, increasing production, and stabilizing the economy. Twelve core tasks have been formulated, including: (1) Strictly organizing Baojia (households), (2) Intensifying self-defense organization and training, (3) Expanding security forces, (4) Enriching military grain and regulating civilian food, (5) Improving conscription on time and in full amount, (6) Reorganizing provincial and county finances, (7) Enriching basic education, (8) Sheltering refugee students and refugees, (9) Completing national defense highways, (10) Increasing grain production, (11) Thoroughly suppressing internal bandits, (12) Supporting owner-farmers and implementing land allocation for soldiers. These twelve core tasks are summarized into five major political affairs: organization and training, grain collection, conscription, suppression of internal bandits, and resettlement of refugees. This year, Sichuan's principle of governance is to seek construction in stability. Next year's policy direction is to mobilize and complete the suppression of rebellion. This is a major transformation of Sichuan from peacetime to wartime. From securing Sichuan to building the nation, the people of Sichuan deeply understand the great historical mission of the present.</p>
<h3>Thunderstorms in Suzhou, Nantong and Other Places</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Suzhou Twenty-Fourth Dispatch] The weather is abnormal. The north wind here is biting, the temperature is falling, and there is a dense drizzle all day long. Suddenly, in the afternoon, there was a sudden downpour with thunder. It only stopped in the evening.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper Nantong Twenty-Fourth Dispatch] It has been raining for days, and today it turned cold again. At 3:50 PM, there was a sudden burst of thunder and a brief shower. [Our Newspaper Changsha Twenty-Fourth Dispatch] It suddenly turned cold here today, and the temperature dropped to minus two degrees Celsius. At about 2:00 AM last night, there was thunder and lightning, and heavy rain poured down, just like a summer rainstorm.</p>
<h3>Zhenjiang All Circles Decide to Expand Troop Comfort Movement on New Year's Day</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Zhenjiang Twenty-Fourth Dispatch] All circles in the provincial capital have decided to expand troop comfort activities on New Year's Day. In addition to organizing comfort groups to bring supplies to visit wounded and sick officers and soldiers, they will also mobilize all theaters to provide free admission to National Army veterans and honorary soldiers on New Year's Day.</p>
<h3>Teacher Detained for Refusing to Pay Overdue Taxes, Hu Jiansong Beaten and Injured</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Wuxi Twenty-Third Dispatch] Officials from the county land and grain office and faculty members of the Jiangsu Wuxi Normal School have caused a great uproar over grain matters. It is reported that Hu Jiansong, a collector from the land and grain office, went to the Jiangsu Provincial Wuxi Normal School at about 7:00 PM last night to collect overdue taxes, which led to a dispute with the school authorities. He took Wang Pu'an, a teacher from the school, to the county. The teachers of the Jiangsu Provincial Wuxi Normal School launched a petition and stormed into the county government, beating Hu Jiansong and injuring him. Public servants then formed a support association and went on strike to show their support. However, according to Principal Shi, the alleged beating incident by the county is purely an insult. Therefore, how to deal with this case will depend on Director Zhou's return to the county before a decision can be made.</p>
<h3>Miniature News</h3>
<p>Changshu</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper Dispatch] Xu Genjin, a resident of Yangjian Town, was suddenly shot and killed by thugs on the night of the 23rd. Xu's concubine was also injured in the head. The murderers are on the run. The authorities are currently searching for them.</p>
<p>Wuxi</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper Dispatch] Qian Sunqing and others from the business community, recently, due to the tense situation, in order to strengthen local self-defense, convened a symposium of local people from all walks of life on the 24th, decided to organize a business self-defense force, and promoted Zhu Wenyuan, Shen Jizhi, Shi Qinglin and others to prepare, and established a joint association of people's public and private organizations to strengthen local contacts.</p>
<p>Suzhou</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper Dispatch] The local winter relief association yesterday hosted reporters. General Secretary Fan Gongren reported: the fundraising target is 10,000 pieces of winter clothing, 320 shi of rice, and daily congee distribution for 2,000 people. Fundraising and a "one yuan movement" are now being launched, and all circles are requested to donate generously.</p>
<h3>Supervisory Committee's Censure Letter to Yangtze Company (Continued from Page Four)</h3>
<p>1. The relevant government agencies that should be censured in this case: (1) It has been found that the Shanghai Municipal Police Department, before the occurrence of this case, had already received a confidential report from Zhao Hongkuan, a member of the Economic Police Team, to the Economic Police Brigade. The Brigade Commander Cheng Yikuan should be regarded as having initiated a denunciation, and should have sent personnel to investigate. However, the Brigade Commander ignored it (no processing documents were found in the files). It was not until September 19 that the member reported in writing again, and it was only delayed until the 23rd that the reply was "OK." He also did not issue an attendance certificate as required to facilitate the investigation duties of the members. Even when the members requested to issue it on the 24th, he ignored it. What was his intention? It is indeed worthy of speculation. It was also found that on September 29, the company was discovered by the Lujiawan Branch Bureau to have secretly transported goods by large trucks. In the previous ten days, it is doubtful whether there were any personnel in charge who heard the news and concealed materials. Brigade Commander Cheng Yikuan of the Economic Police Team, at a time when economic control was in full swing, repeatedly delayed after members of his team denounced large-scale hoarding. It is not certain whether he deliberately facilitated the Yangtze Construction Company's concealment of criminal suspicion, but his dereliction of duty is clearly obvious.</p>
<p>Police Chief Yu Shuping also failed to take active action in handling this case. For example, investigating ledgers and documents is a necessary procedure for the progress of this case, but the Bureau never took the initiative to conduct a thorough check. Later, Wei Yueguang supervised the investigation, and the company unreasonably refused. The Bureau also did not make effective corrections based on its authority, which was obviously different from the attitude towards ordinary companies. After checking the goods, the so-called deposited goods were said to be shared with the Dalian Bay warehouse by the Shishi Xinbao and Dalu Bao newspapers, and the Lichang Company denied that Yangtze Construction Company imported the cars, etc. However, the relevant parties were not provided with documents or checked thoroughly, which was not as strict as in general cases. The Economic Management Office's telegram on October 13 instructed the Bureau to handle the case according to law, but no measures were taken by the Bureau. Brigade Commander Cheng Yikuan repeatedly delayed the case and failed to investigate and correct it. In summary, Bureau Chief Yu Shuping was also afraid of power and neglected his duties.</p>
<p>2. Mayor Wu of the Shanghai Municipal Government did not ask about this case at first. Only after Wei Yueguang personally urged him with a letter did he begin to handle it, but there were still many improprieties. For example, regarding whether the import of goods was legal and whether there was any concealment, he only relied on the company's presented goods storage receipts and customs tax bills to check, and did not investigate ledgers and original documents as required. How could he investigate whether there was any concealment of goods and whether the import of goods was falsely labeled? After Xue Xieshen Du Lie reviewed the incomplete documents, he discovered that the company had imported more than ten kinds of goods that were prohibited from import or temporarily not allowed to be imported by falsely using accounting forms to evade taxes. Lichang Company also stored cars of Yangtze Construction Company, and there were imports without permits and applications for remittances. At that time, the review work presided over by the municipal government was hasty, perfunctory, and unrealistic. For example, the police bureau reported that the deposited items, shared warehouses, and Lichang Company denied any commercial relationship with Yangtze Construction Company, but it did not provide evidence and conduct thorough checks, nor did it correct and re-investigate. Furthermore, if the company violated industrial and commercial management laws and the Shanghai Municipal Warehouse Inspection Points, regarding joining trade associations and reporting the quantity of goods, import date, and warehouse location to the relevant trade associations each month and reporting to the Social Bureau, the main officials should have investigated early on, but the municipal government and its subordinate agencies did not impose any penalties. Furthermore, among the goods hoarded by Yangtze Construction Company, in addition to replying that the industrial raw materials and daily necessities would be supplied to the market at the price limit stipulated by the Economic Control Supervisor's Office on November 6, the remaining goods, such as Western medicines, most of which were daily necessities, had been stored for more than a year, and the number reached more than 2,000 boxes. In particular, there were also quite a few prohibited imports and unauthorized imports of glass products (colloidal), cosmetics, woolen products, and foreign wines. The municipal government, as the proper competent agency for this case, did not mention a word in the reply, which is incomprehensible, at a time when the whole country was paying attention to the outcome of the case. Mayor Wu Guozhen, even if he was not deliberately protecting, was also neglecting his duties. (To be continued)</p>
