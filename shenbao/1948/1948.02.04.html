<h3 id="c28">安定第一！法紀至上！ <a href="#c28" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e28" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">28</a></h3>
<p>國家現正入於剿匪戡亂的嚴重關頭：同時，國家也正在向民主憲政的大道開始邁步的時候·在這個階段，我們最迫切的需要是安定，也是法紀！</p>
<p>共匪是製造騷動的，它希望從騷動中推翻社會秩序。而一般善良人民的要求，顯然是相反的；他們需要的不是騷動而是安定。共匪是破壞法紀的，它希望用毁法亂紀的手段，减損政府的威信，從而利用暴力以奪取政權。而一般善良人民則祗是切望在法律範圍之內，有安居樂業的生活，故他們一定知道尊重法紀。</p>
<p>目前，無論國家大局，無論地方情况、一般善良人民實已感到與共匪勢難兩立。有了共匪作祟。使不加以芟除撲滅，善良人民將無生存餘地！所以今天我們站在善良人民的立塲來判斷一件事的是非，其標準簡單得很，維護社會安定者爲善，否則爲惡；尊重國家法紀者爲直，否則爲曲！</p>
<p>單就上海市而論，這五六天來，竟連續發生了三次不幸事件：上月二十九日，同濟學潮，市長橫遭毆辱；三十一日，舞業請願，社會局突被搗毁；本月二日，申新九廠工潮，工人强佔廠房，拆毁機件，以暴力抗拒蒞塲彈壓的軍警。從這些叫囂騷擾的事件看來，姑無論其有什麼背景，無論其是否有彼此聯帶的關係，但總免不了使上海這個國際都市蒙受「動亂」的汚點。惟其動竄，所以令人感到社會漸不安定；亦惟其動　，所以更將使人茫然於國家究竟還有沒有法紀。</p>
<p>我們在這裏首先要指出的，就是：民主決不是「暴民作主」，憲政決不是「無法之政」！一切暴方行爲，無論其原始的動機如何，無　其暴行的對象是什麽，更無論其假借憑藉的口實是怎樣動聽，在一個現代民主國家，是絕對不能容許的。因爲民主憲政的第一義，就在使人人在法律軌道內有他自由的合理的發表意見的平等權利，而暴力所加，則一定有一部分人所應享有的這些合法權利彼剝奪了，被侵害了。暴民政治之下，必無自由；暴民政治之下，必無平等。自由平等喪失了，那裏還能希望安居樂業。國家之所以要剿匪，所以要戡亂，就是要「出斯民於水火」，而所謂水火者，就是喪失了自由平等的「倒懸」牛活。上海市究竟還小過是共匪所陰謀擾亂的地方，而不是共匪所蹂躪的匪區，善良人民當然有要求政府當局保障安定和貫澈法紀的權利。惟有安定，惟有法紀，纔可使上海市免於流入暴民政治之邊緣。</p>
<p>在這個立塲上，我們相信一般善良市民，全都擁護宣司令吳市長在前晚記者招待會上所宣布的嚴正能度。同　學潮，舞業風潮，和申新九廠工潮，究竟有無共匪潛伏份子在鼓煽，姑置不談，但演變而至於暴動，實已非善良人民所能容忍。只要聽聽這幾天來各界領袖人士和中堅份子的譴責之聲，就可知道眞正的民意所在。</p>
<p>同濟學生，為了學生自治會的組織問題，想要和政府或學校當局有所爭持，就算有理由，也只有在和平秩序之下可以據理陳述；一旦暴動，不論共暴行是否加於市長，縱是加之於師長或另一個普通的市民，都是違法的，都應受到法律的制裁。而他們原來請願的動機是否純正，倒在其次了，又如舞業職工和舞女，爲了請求寬緩禁舞或改變禁舞政令，原也可以依據法律，申訴理由，堂堂正正向政府有所請求，縱算奉行中央命令的社會局已經抽籤，也還沒有到實行停業的時候，儘有提起行政訴願或訴諸社會公論的餘地。可惜領導這些團體的人，無論勞資雙方，都沒有這種理智生活的訓練，乃因少數野性難馴的份子，逞一時的血氣，演出此一幕搗毁行政機關的暴民醜劇，於是本來或許可以得人同情的一件事，本來或許還有辦法可以轉園挽救的一件事，也變成了喪失社會的同情。至於申新九廠工人，平時待遇本已不差，他業職工或感望塵莫及，乃舊歷年關將到，突然有此封閉廠門，脅迫罷工，甚至使用暴力抗拒軍警的暴行，確已受了少數暴民的挾制，縱使多數善良工人還有理智，到那時也沒有方法脫身而出。我們以爲，他們事後追思，大多數的同濟學生，大多數的舞女，和舞業職工，和大多數的申新九廠工人，一定在後悔不及的。後悔是改過的根源，是遷善的開始。我們願意提醒他們一句；這些惡果，都是少數暴民破壞安定，破壞法紀所造成的。故僅僅後悔還不够，必須覺悟過來，從此不但不再受那少數暴民的煽動而爲其犧牲，而且應該一起站在善良人民的一面，大家努力來維護安定，尊重法紀。</p>
<p>最後，我們也願貢獻政府當局幾句逆耳之言。孟子說：「徒善不足以爲政；徒法不能以自行」。人民目前要安定，政府必須給他們以安定，纔是善政。人民目前要法紀，政府必須先尊重法紀，纔可希望行法。目前大局，一切關鍵在剿匪，在戡亂。有助於剿匪戡亂的大事，應　心竭力的去做；其他應置爲緩圖。不要動於時髦名詞，以為這是善政，那又是善政，便應百廢俱舉，樣樣都做，而結果則徒然法令如牛毛，一事辦不通，連官吏自己都沒弄明白管理這些事的究竟有幾種現行法。天下本來可以無事的，何必一定耍做「庸人」而「自造」些事故出來呢？本來人家在那裏可以暫時安居，暫吿樂業的，爲什麽一定要在這個時候使得他們失去了職業，敲破了飯碗呢？前年冬天，政府雷厲風行的要取締攤販，要取締人力車，後來幸而中樞當局顧念民生，在此非常時期，暫從寬辦，並且說凡足以影響小民牛計的，概從緩辦，社會因此减少了若干騷動的因素。我們以爲這纔是識大體的政治家。我們耍呼籲政府：共匪和其盲從份子，正在四面八方找尋如何製造騷亂的題目，政府當局一方面固然要嚴防他們，另一方面，對一切舉措設施，我們要請全國上下大家注意：安定第　　法紀至上　也要深思熟慮，不可再送幾個題目給他們呀。</p>

<p>〔路透社華盛頓二日電〕國務都透露：馬歇爾國務卿業已建議於二月二十日在倫敦召開四强外長代表會議，討論對奧和約及蘇聯最近提出之新建議。蘇聯之修正建議，已於一月廿六日遞達華盛頓。此外，四强外長代表會並將對論法國所推關於處置奥境德產之建議，以及對奧和約之其他各項　題。國務部並宣布將派國務都歐洲司副司長賴勃爲出席四强外長代表會之美國代表，以繼最近辭去奥境盟管會職務之美委員杜琪。</p>

<p>〔聯合社華盛頓二日電〕國務部發言人宣稱，蘇聯指責美國在伊朗推行　武主義，若非故意曲解，定係純粹謊言。蘇聯曾指責美國企圖將伊朗成爲戰略性軍事基地，蘇聯認此舉爲干涉其南鄰內政。此外，國務部爲迎頭對付蘇聯一連串外交與宣傳攻勢，另有兩種舉措：　凖備提出照會，駁斥上月廿一日蘇聯關於北非洲曼拉哈戰時美軍機塲重行開放，觸犯義和約之抗議。　等待蘇聯關於美機在日本附近偵察蘇聯船隻之另一次抗議之送達。</p>
<p>關於蘇聯指責美國在伊朗之行動，國務部新聞處長麥克特莫，不待詳細報吿，即逐項駁斥爲「揑造」或「曲解」。據麥氏稱，大國駐伊朗之軍事代表團共兩組，一爲軍事顧問團，一爲改組憲兵之顧問團依照公佈之協定，其任務限於訓練與諮詢，人數總共僅五十名。此外，美國已同意給予信用貸款二千五百萬美元，准許伊朗購買美軍剩餘物資，但伊朗政府現提議僅動用其中之一千萬美元。莫斯科責難美國正在依美國方式，改編伊朗軍隊，改革工業以製造美式武器等，麥氏謂均非事實。蘇聯所稱美國正在建乘巨大飛機塲，以供伊朗以外之飛機應用一層，麥氏亦加以否認，謂美國政府並不在伊朗任何地方建築飛機塲。至謂美國正在協助伊朗鞏固邊防，並正用飛機測繪邊界地圖等節，麥氏則斥之爲全出揑造。</p>

<p>孤立主義者不斷自尋煩惱</p>
<p>通往美國成立中立法案之路，是因聽取那埃委員會（Nye　Committee）的意見而鋪起來的。這個委員會是由參院所成立，目的在調査軍火的製造和出售。我懷疑任何國會委員會有比這個委員會對我國外交關係產生更不幸的影響的，除了先前考慮威爾遜總統所提凡爾賽條約的參院外交委員會，或堪與以比擬。</p>
<p>北達柯泰州共和黨參議員那埃（Gerald　P．Nye）在發表了幾篇主張透露美國製造商向外國政府出售軍火詳情的論文之後，就在一九三四年二月提出一項決議，主張成立委員會進行調査。</p>
<p>在參院准許此項決議案通過之後，少數黨共和黨議員那埃由副議長茄納任命爲調査委員會主席。那埃是一個孤立主義色彩極濃的人物，而決議案的通過簡直是隨便的結果，並沒有經過稍爲審愼的考慮。這是一椿重大的錯誤，應由參議員畢德曼負責。畢德曼本人在好多方面也是一個孤立主義者，照例，為某種目的而成立一個特別委員會時，應該由多數黨—當時是民主黨—而不應該由少數黨的議員担任主席，此在一個調査委員會，尤其如此。畢德曼雖然是外交委員會的主席，但是忙於其他方面的工作，決定讓那埃出來担任。假如畢德曼推薦另一佩主席，副議長是愈接受的。</p>
<p>假如我能夢想到一個孤立主義的共和黨員會被任命主席的話，我是會迅速加以反對的，但是我總以爲按照通常的習慣一個多數黨的議員會被提名，並且他會把調査工作限於合法和合理的範圍之內，不致於使它成爲一種大規模的宣傳運動</p>
<p>任命那埃是一個致命傷，因爲委員會在他主持之下，開始擴大調査的範圍，企圖證明美國之被牽涉第一次世界大戰，是由美國銀行家和軍火製造商所造成的。它忽視了或者反駁我們參加這一次戰爭的重大理由，那就是德國潛艇不法擊沉美國船隻和毁滅美國人的生命，以及德國假如獲勝對於美國和它立國原則的危險。我們不得不倡導自衛的原則。</p>
<p>我們這輩人抱有一種國際觀點，就是假如世界和平要予以維持的話，美國必須參與此項努力；我們曾就此點據理力爭。所以這個委員會的大部份人，事實上在摧殘我們立論的基礎。他們的見解是：假如出售軍火和對交戰國的借款能予制止，美國可以自動地避免戰爭，不需要和別國合作來達到這個目的。歐洲和亞洲的危險日益增長，對於他們祗不過是我們應該退入我國海岸以內的一種迫切理由，因爲他們是反對以任何援助給予別國，以謀解決此等危險的。</p>
<p>這個委員會侮蔑威爾遜總統在第一次世界大戰中所抱的動機和誠意，挖苦我們的前戰友英國和法國並且替德意志帝國洗刷罪狀，因此對於我們何以參加一九一七年戰爭的理由，給予美國人民一個完全錯誤的觀念。委員會對於軍火的交易，無欵曾作有用處的宣露，但是影響所及，却使我國落入最深刻的孤立主義之內，而揆諸當前局勢，却正是亟需運用我們的勢力來協力避免國外日益迫近的戰爭威脅的時候。</p>
<p>委員會發覺全國熱中於反對大銀行家和軍火製造商的消息。它頗受大衆的注意，因此好勝的慾望更形提高，希望獲得更多的注意。它的首席調査官魯欣布希（Stephen　Raushenbush）在大體上說是委員會的主體，一般地指導它的活動。他渴望委員會登入頭條新聞，至于他的消息對於別國政府——不要說我們自己的人民了——究竟有什麽影響，却極少顧及，而消息本身又往往不過是謠言和半眞實的眞理。</p>
<p>更有進者，委員會的參議員，簡直太讓他們的首席調査官爲所欲爲了，猶如在這種情形之下往往發生的。委員會中的人物很整齊，頗有有能力者，有幾個人是一向以攻擊大銀行家和軍火製造商作爲消遣的。這輩人物，對於委員會的實際工作以及對銀行家和軍火製造商的猛烈攻擊，是應該負大部份責任的。它們的宣傳主任不斷把所謂新聞，源源不絕地流入本國和其他國家的報紙。</p>
<p>政府方面，顯然沒有一個人可以抵擋孤立主義的旋膩。祗要一提起調査，就會引起廣泛的歡迎。總統和我，當然同意和委員會合作，特別是爲了它的原來目的，即調査軍火交易，是値得　揚的。</p>
<p>委員會費去了一九三四年的整個夏季去審査文件和匯集證件之後，開始在九月四日陳述意見。我們和其他國家的困難也幾乎立即開始。布伊諾艾里斯政府抗議委員會有關某一阿根廷海軍上將的若干傳說。英國代理外相望西泰德（Vansit-tart）對於有關英皇喬治五世的謠傳性質的指責，提出抗議。墨西哥政府抗議涉及羅特里哥士總統各點。其他拉丁美洲政府對於牽制它們若干高級官吏受賄的責難，表示反對。中國政府提出了一個備忘錄，否認從我們那裏獲得的一千萬美元小麥借款，曾用以購買軍火</p>
<p>結果我在九月十一日親自去看那埃委員會，同他們談了兩小時。我指出一點，就是由於公佈牽涉其他政府的首長或高級官吏的謠言，我國的外交關係正蒙受損害。因此，那埃參議員就擬了一封信給我，承認委員會記錄中的若干聲明可能造成一種錯誤的印象，此點他深表遺憾。我自己也發表了一個聲明，闡明委員會或我國政府的任何官吏決無對任何其他政府或其官吏有絲毫得罪的意思。我把那埃的信扎和我自己的聲明送給曾提抗議各國的大使。</p>
<p>但是，當那埃委員會開始公開涉及國務院的文件時，情勢更形惡劣，而這些文件的公佈，根本是沒有被核准過的。根據全世界所接受的外交禮儀，一個政府從另一個政府接到了一個文件之後，通常是不予公佈的，一直要等別國政府正式核准其發表。所以，爲了那埃委員會的原故，我們開始和其他許多政府進入緊張的關係。委員會這種疏忽的異常有害的消息，我覺得極難加以遏制。我費了不少時間，忙於向其他政府解釋或道歉。因爲它們正深感不快。</p>
<p>但是，當那埃委員會着手硏究第一次世界大戰背景，開始吊査和協約國有交往的紐約各銀行的記錄時，我們的困難甚至變成更尖銳化。英國和注國大使屢次抗議。</p>
<p>我已經在設法命名總支持我的努力，謀使那埃委員會的活動限於合理的範圍之內。三月十五日，我交給他一個備忘錄，敦促他召集那埃委員會到白宮來舉行會議，勸他們「對足以妨礙我國政府和別國政府關係的問題公開陳述意見時，應該避免任何不必要的挑撥」。總統的確在四天之後和那埃委員會各委員會晤，但是爲了某種理由，並沒有把我的要求提出。</p>
<p>我希望那埃委員會各委員明瞭的一點，就是希特勒已經推翻凡爾賽條約的軍事條款，墨索里尼正在完成侵略阿比西尼亞的計劃而英法和美國爲二十年前的文件激烈　論的塲面，是決不能遏制希特勒和　索里尼的計劃的。就在這個時候，英國和法國正設法使德國接受軍備限制協定，勸誘墨索里尼放棄侵略非洲，而那埃委員會所引起的反英和反法浪潮，決不能有助於英　的努力。</p>
<p>可是那埃委員會處事疏忽的最惡劣例子，尙在後面。一九三六年一月十五日，委員會在公開陳述意見時，提起了英外相巴爾福（Arthur　J．Balfour）於一九一七年五月十八日向國務卿蘭辛（Lansing）所提出的一個機密備忘錄的內容，其中涉及英國和其他協約國政府的秘密協定。那埃聲言當威爾遜總統和蘭辛國務卿說明在巴黎和會前他們對於英國的秘密約定並無所知一怖，係屬謊言。我們事前曾徵詢過英國政府的意見，問他們是否准許發表這個備忘錄，他們加以拒絕，並且我們曾在一九三五年十二月廿三日把這一點通知那埃。因此這種行動，尤其是一種嚴重的失信。我向那埃委員會竭力抗議，結果它同意把巴爾福憊忘錄的全份交還國務院。</p>
<p>一月二十日，我向報界發表了一個聲明，闡述國務院對公佈檔案中機密文件的態度。我說我國政府顯屬不能在未獲有關政府的准許將機密文件發表，因爲這個政府是信任我們可以保守秘密的」。</p>
<p>我在一次記老招待會上說：「我在威爾遜政府曾任職工作。不用說，我和美國的大衆一樣，對於他的愛國心和誠實審愼具有最高的敬意—已往如此，於今亦然」。</p>
<p>那埃的意見陳述，給孤立主義者提供了我們這時代中第一個中立法案的跳板，並且就爲了這個理田，我不厭其煩，予以詳述。</p>
<p>事實是我不希望中立的立法。當然我不希望由孤立主義者像那埃這樣的人所提倡的中立法，因爲它會束縛政府的手足，並且會吿訴可能的侵略者儂德國，義大利或者日本說，它們可以向它們預定中的被犧牲者宣戰，而我們在那時候會注意我們的公民不致以軍火供給這個被犧牲者的。</p>
<p>我不希望看到一種立法會事前吿訴世界說，假如戰爭發生，我們不致有所行動，因爲這樣，就會妨碍我們運用我們的勢力來防止戰爭。我也不希望看到一種立法，規定假如戰爭發生，我們不得以最少量的援助給國際聯盟這個世界機構，帮助它使戰爭結束的努力。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕上海市獎學金　一審査委員會，於昨日下午四時，假國際飯店十四樓舉行。吳市畏抱病準時出席主持。計到潘公慶·實鐵吾·杜月笙·吳開先·徐寄　·王曉　·劉攻芸·李熙謀·及新聞界負責人，各業領袖，暨各校校長等二百餘人。首由市長就本市接連發生之同濟學潮，舞女搗毁社會局，及申新紗廠龍工事件略加申述後，强調社會秩序如此混亂，帮助失學靑年更屬刻不容緩。謂學潮之發生，乃靑年人不滿現實所致，濟寒學生之升學問題，必須設法解決之。本人雖受毆辱，但認爲靑年是可愛，的學生亦可愛，動手毆打係少數暴徒所爲，對於全體學生，本人仍極問情，搶救失學，乃吾等應盡之責任，希望各界熱烈捐輸。</p>
<p>潘議長以吳市長扶病爲淸寒學生奔走，特代表表示謝意，並對獎學金籌募事宜作簡單報吿。卅六年度夏季獎學金募捐目標爲五十億，結果捐得五十九億另九百六十九萬七千四百元，發出四十五億六千一百萬元，皆由統一審核委員會鄭重審核後，直接發給各校當局者。現本屆各校因開支浩大，學費亦吿提高，專科以上學校收費，已定爲四百五十萬至六百萬之數，此數初聽似甚龐大，然以米價折合，亦僅爲三擔至四擔之間，僅合戰前之三十元左右，且學校當局須顧到敎授待遇不能過於菲薄，處境確有困難，自不能加以苛責。惟學費增高後，失學問題更形嚴重，故本屆之獎學金，目標擬定爲一百五十億，係去年之二倍。惟能否達到標的，尙待各界領袖慷慨輸將。現本會已發出通知，請去年認捐之各單位繼續捐助，如不足之數，當向其他各業進行勸募。</p>
<p>潘議長詞畢，各界當塲認捐者甚為踴躍，昨一日間，總數已達一百二十四億二千五百萬元。認捐名單如下：本報六億，新聞報六億，大化報一億，市府五十億，證券交易所十億，市銀行十億，揚子電氣公司二億，中央銀行二億，中國銀行二億，交通銀行二億，農民銀行二億，中央信託局二億，郵匯局一億，中央合作金庫一億，紗布業五億，銀樓業五億，染織業五億，航業五億，內河輪航一億，麵粉業五億，中國南　兄弟烟草公司七千五百萬，大公報一讀者五千萬。</p>
<p>潘議長旋發表個人感想，略稱：籌募獎學金乃政府與社會互相合作，自動扶助淸寒弟子，但必須要趁此機會，吿誠學生，吾等並未向他們負債，我們旣未欠債，自無義務來籌這筆錢。學生更應認淸，社會如此出力，他們應該知道報答社會。若靑年仍不領悟，依然受人利用，興風作浪，嫌一百五十億尙且不够，企圖貪求無厭，則此輩靑年有什麼理由再愛護他們？本人昨會得到消息，謂聖約翰大學內曾有各校學生齊集開會，主張市政常局須准各校個別自行籌募，本人認爲絕對不可。社會秩序必須維持，決不容學生隨處　車，到處亂闖，致破壞社會秩序。且學生零星募集，未必能有五億十億，於事無補，而反有肇事之機會。故本人認爲政府固須愛護學子，同時亦須以嚴正之態度吿誡他們！凡今後發現任何學校，有學生出外自行募捐者，即取消其請求分配獎學金資格。</p>
<p>嗣宣司令，徐寄　，王曉籟，王芸生，朱經農等，分別致詞。</p>
<p>最後市長起立對熱烈捐輸各界表示感謝，並報吿最近渠接獲情報，謂共黨最近發刋「學生日報」，內中對於政府籌募獎學金之舉大肆攻擊，並宣言要政府保障每個靑年都有書讀。此種論調，簡直極盡荒唐，本人今日公開爲「學生日報」作宣傳，望學生自己去硏究一番！對於被捕學生之處，理不擬過嚴，但亦決不從寬，完全依照法律來辦理。毆人者有其應得之罪，煽動者亦有應得之罪。</p>

<p>關於吳市長日前在同濟大學被毆始末，吳氏昨曾有詳細報導。渠稱：衝突發生前，本人屢勸學生切勿向前行走，俾避免與警察接觸。四時左右，尙平靜無事，多數學生與本人撩大，感情融洽。後來突然起亂，料想必係有人指揮。時石塊泥土向警察直飛，致警十情感極爲衝動。當時有大羣學生向前衝去，本人正隔乎其間，隨身僅警士及副官各一名，突有五人衝向本人，旁邊即有人喊打。本人曾親聞該校自治會主席大喊「不能打市長」，然左右額已吿挨打。我以常時情勢危急，急令警士「不准開槍」，語猶未竟，即有人扼住喉嚨。旁邊有人呌：「你的警察打人」。我即說：「你放我起來，我呌警察不開槍」。但旁邊又有人喊「不要讓他起來」！</p>
<p>回想當時　萬分危險</p>
<p>事情過後，回想起來，感覺當時情景萬分危險。陰謀份子早已有嚴密佈置，把學生當做犧牲品，把政府作爲工具，企圖製造流血慘案。當時我在被毆時，只要喊聲「救命」，深信警察必然開槍。我爲避免流血，令警　不准開槍，而喉嚨竟爲人所扼。痛定思痛，認爲陰謀實在可怖。此番藉上帝保佑，且靠警士紀律嚴正，始未中其計。現陰謀者於事過後，又大肆造謠，宣稱市長並非學生毆傷，乃警士馬隊踐踏所致，實屬荒唐之至，但望靑年學子不要受其利用。</p>

<p>〔本報南京三日電〕滬申新九廠衝突事件，消息傳抵京，各方極爲注意，蔣主席尤爲重視，三日先後於下午四時召見國防部次長鄭介民，九時召見谷正綱，對此有所埀詢，並予指示。鄭次長旋即於十一時乘車赴滬調査事實眞相。又張羣院艮於五時曾召鄭谷等有關要員商討處理申新事件之善後辦法。又社會部長谷正綱三日出席政務會議報吿上海申新九廠衝突事件經過甚詳。旋經各委員提出意見，成主為安定人心起見，對申新九廠事件之處理，仍採疏導方式。張院長並表示若干實際問題如年賞福利等，應負責予以解決，俾工人生活得以安定。</p>
<h3 id="c98">申新九廠恢復平靜　大門緊閉殘跡猶存　　肇事工人有嚴密組織木殼槍彈來源堪硏究 <a href="#c98" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e98" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">98</a></h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕申新九廠經前日之動亂，昨已恢復平靜，記者於昨日傍晚前往該廠巡視，見大門業已緊閉，僅留邊門出入，三四警士逡巡門外，鄰近若干好閒居民則猶在門口探首踮足。牆上貼有炎方佈吿稱：「査本廠此次發生罷工不幸事件，廠內各項設備損毁甚重，現正積極整理以謀逐步復工，一俟整理就緒，各部復工有期，再行分別佈吿週知。」尙有該廠產業工會之佈吿稱：「査本廠此次發生工潮，竟至流血，全係少數陰該份子一手造成，而我善良工友，因不明內幕，竟爲奸徒利用，殊堪憐憫。本會站在工友立塲，除促請廠方儘速開車復工以維生計外，對於此次不參加暴動之工友，自當全力維護，至盼我工友靜待開工日期，切勿庸人自擾爲要。」廠內第三道鐵門內外衝突地點之殘跡尙未淸除，太片·碎石·鐵棍等仍狼藉滿地。據廠方負責人談：因辦事人員大都已數日夜未休息，同時有關機關尙待攝影留證，故將於今日起始能開始淸理。至各種機器上損失之零件修配尙可無處，不致影響生產，惟時間方面，恐陰曆年內開工已不可能，勢將延至陰曆年初，對於工人羣中不良份子，決予淸除，其餘仍將繼續錄用。</p>
<p>未涉嫌工人　仍留居宿舍</p>
<p>據普陀路警察分局戚分局長談稱：紛擾申警員所失去之槍械五枝，迄未査獲，但在廠中曾檢獲木殼槍彈殼兩枚，據渠所知，前晚赴申新九廠彈壓之軍警，均無此項槍彈，故此項槍彈之來源，殊堪硏究。</p>
<p>此次工潮中已査明無肇事嫌疑之工人，現仍安居於工房宿舍中，當時涉嫌而被捕之工人六十八名，則已分別扣押於總局，盧家灣及嵩出等警分局中。</p>
<p>五千隻飯碗　亦作武器用</p>
<p>事後調査所得，此次工人肇事，事前曾有嚴密組織，指揮部設於廠內工務處辦公室內，發號施令，控制全體工人行動，其下並設有運輸隊利用運紗車輛裝載紗錠零件至二樓三樓，作爲拒捕武器。此外並在三層樓細紗問屋頂，査獲大油桶十隻，其中尙存留多量石塊·磚塊·滾鐵·鐵輪等物，當時尙有飯廳中之飯碗，亦盡被移充武器，因此有五千餘隻飯碗，全部遭殃。</p>
<p>有若干女工　被擠軋流產</p>
<p>又據該廠工會負責人談：此次事件純係少數陰謀份子鼓動，並未經由工會交涉。最可憐者爲大多數被強迫參加之女工，彼等被關閉在廠房內不得外出，是輩女工，家中或有襁褓嬰兒，或有老弱病者，啼飢號寒，呻吟呼喊，更有若干懷孕女工，被擠流產，誠屬慘不忍聞。</p>

<p>本市最近連續發生之三大風潮，現均已吿一段落，關於善後問題之處置，警局兪局長三日下午五時，向記者宣佈如次：</p>
<p>一月廿九日同濟學　，及毆辱吳國楨市長事件，共逮捕嫌疑份子九七人，經詳加偵訊後，其中　紹　等二人嫌疑重大，並有共匪特務份子之嫌疑，決定送警備司令部軍法訊辦，另三九名送地檢處訊辦，其餘已陸續保釋。同濟大學情形已轉好，故當局決定不解散，警局駐校之鐵甲軍部隊已撤回，現僅留保警一分隊駐守附近。</p>
<p>一月卅一日舞女及舞聽職工搗毀社會局事件，當時逮捕七九七人，經兩書夜偵訊，留押一一六人，餘均保釋，一一六人中四十餘人情節重大，將予嚴辦，其中情節特重者將送警備部法辦，另四十餘人分別訓斥交保釋放，尙有一部份在考慮中。關於舞潮部份，另據偵緝科科長酈俊厚稱：依據偵訊結果，已可判明該一事件之主動者爲職工（舞女大班），舞女方面參加者，並無紅星，大冬爲「阿桂姐」之流，若輩學識經驗淺薄，情感易被激動，要爲凑數而已。故警局之偵訊，以犯罪行爲而決定處罰之輕重，決定嚴辦之四十餘人中，有名金英者，當時剪電綫，打玻璃；另名譚培吾者，高聲喊打，爲領導羣衆之人。至舞業「三巨頭」孫洪元·唐宗傑·胡　源·當包括在內。又參加搗毁社局行爲者，尙有舞　「小郞」等份子，年齡極輕，對破壞工作　覺興趣而茫然無知，應負法律之責任。此等人之處置，社局第四處處長袁文彰建議送遊民習藝所，惟尙未作最後決定。</p>
<p>二月二日申新九廠工人暴動事件，共逮捕當塲指認之肇事份子一九九人，計男一三二人，女六七人，其中包括起領導作用之吳世珍·費高根·孫漢超·張富大·繆杏根等多人，現由　緝科詳細偵訊中，將依情節輕重，送警備部軍法處或地檢處訊辦，成交保釋放。暴動當時，工人傷卅七人，死三人，爲王　妹（擠踏致死），朱敏珍及蔣正新（均爲槍彈打死）。警察方面受傷五一人，其中重傷五人，至在出事地點被捕之交大學生張育生，經申新九廠經理吳昆生證明為該廠工人所請之敎師，業已由廠長領回。</p>
<p>俞局長並透露：鑒於運日紛擾情形，警局已擬具計劃增加保安警察一總隊，計一千名（按現有兩總隊），以應付臨時緊急事態。</p>

<p>上海市總工會，三日為申新九廠不幸事件，發表通吿，原文略云：「査此次申新九廠不幸事件，由於陰謀份子潛入工友羣中，蓄意破壞生產擾亂社會秩序所造成，而我多數工友，一時受其朦蔽，致造成流血事件，出於盲從行動，突然罷工，不但提出無理要求，且拒絕談判，待事成無局，雖多數工友發覺爲奸徒利用，又爲惡勢力所脅迫，僵持多日，終於與地方軍警發生衝突，實爲工界之不幸。其廠內機器復遭毁損，實屬不智之舉。務希各工會自即日起，嚴加防範，如有奸徒潛至工會或工廠活動時，迅即報吿本會，或立即通知治安機關査究」。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕申新九廠經理吳昆生，昨語記者，此次九廠工人所提條件，廠方接受與否，影響及於整個棉紡業，及其他工商業，本廠固無法接受。至言年賞，在國歷年關前，早已分四十天，五十天，六十天，按八折分發，總數已發出二百卅億元，廠方籌措該款時，已竭盡困難，實無法再行籌款。此次工潮解決後，尙待社會局決定善後處理辦決。惟原有九廠產業公會，當須改組。全體工人，須重行登記。俟調查後，再予錄用。深望能在農曆年關內，恢復開工云。</p>

<p>婦人慘遭設計殺害埋屍泥潭滅跡敗露</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕新涇警分局周家橋派出所，於本月二日中午，有居住長寗路一一六六弄二十四號草棚之宿遷人陳天鈞投報，謂其妾徐國華又名紅寳（二十歲，淮安人），失踪已歷八日，生死不明，請求查緝。當由巡官莊贊賜派幹員張守正前往調查，並報吿該分局司法股長杜時言，經二十四小時之偵査結果，獲悉所謂失踪之少婦，竟被其小叔陳天慶唆使同鄕周慶華·張永堂等謀害後移屍埋於梵皇渡浜邊泥潭中。昨午已將屍體掘出，並將周慶華·張永堂二名拘獲（見圖），惟主犯陳天慶及另一共犯侯美齡，則尙在逃未獲。　緣死者之天陳天鈞，原爲聯勤總部經理署南京調節倉庫中尉官佐，去年</p>
<p>被裁失業</p>
<p>即携其愛妾徐氏來滬，住於長寗路一一六六弄二十四號草棚胞弟陳天慶處嗣隨陳多年之同鄉周慶華，張永堂·侯美齡（均係調節倉庫之士兵）等三人，亦相繼被裁來滬。未幾，陳因所蓄無多，生活即感困難，乃於最近約同周·侯二人，在附近某處竊得衣箱一只，事後爲其胞弟知悉，認爲其兄長此以往，將趨墮落，並認爲其兄不務正業，其最大原因，實爲</p>
<p>迷戀徐氏　所致，因此遂不顧犯法，竟萌殺徐之心。上月二十五日，乘陳赴京機會。即召周·張·侯三人會商，三人亦深恐竊案被舉發，竟允所請，並相約於翌日晚間動手。至期，陳等叩門，先以索烟爲由，迨入門後，即以預備之麻繩用强將徐氏勒斃。事後由周侯二人將屍體抬至梵皇發浜邊，埋於預掘泥潭內，覆以厚土，</p>
<p>意圖滅跡　見愛妾，四出査訊，迄無下落，而其弟則諉稱徐氏恐已捲逃，陳疑信參半，乃於三十日趕赴鎭江妾家査詢，結果一無所獲，復於本月一日來滬，時則其弟亦吿失踪，遂至周慶華·張永堂處査詢，詎周亦恐案發，已離家他去，周妻見陳突如其來，一時態度失常，張則笑謂：「事已過去，可不必追究」。陳即訊以是否死去，張默然。至此陳乃益疑，遂於二日投報周家橋派出所，經將張及周妻拘押偵訊，</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕値此臘盡歲殘社會秩序迭起波動之時，各方對冬令救濟工作情形頗表關切。社會局長吳開先昨特發表冬令救濟委員會三月來之設施槪况如次：</p>
<p>目前動用之救濟經費僅二百億，包括十六處庇寒所之修建工程，難民之衣服，口糧與醫藥衛生，浚河工程用具，以及施粥所設備等。救濟設施分　收容留養，設置庇寒所三處，截至月前為止，三所共收容難民三千名。難民之給義依照政府規定每名每月食米兩斗，副食費每名每月五萬元難民進所後每人發給內衣褲二套，棉襖褲一套，棉被一條，布襪布鞋各一雙，並　有毛巾牙刷等衛生用品。其中第三庇寒所因成立最遲，管理員又缺乏經驗，成績欠佳，現已調派兒童敎養所管理員四名前往協助。庇寒所難民每見參觀者至，輒圍繞或下跪哀訴，上年度已有此種現象，蓋此輩中多數爲乞丐，平日每天可進益十數萬元，且又不慣紀律生活</p>
<p>以工代賑：現在先動手浚河工作，計疏濬江灣沙涇港，漕河涇浦匯塘，大塲走馬塘，浦東都台浦馬家浜等處。另外在滬西疏濬浜溝數處，爲便利施工及供給工賑難民食宿起見，在各施工地點由工務局設計蓋造工賑庇寒所十三處，已全部動工。截至目前爲止，參加工賑難民已有三千名，尙可陸續增加。</p>
<p>施粥施衣：主辦施粥所八所，與地方合辦六所，共計十四所，施粥所分佈地點計閘北區五所，北站區一所，南市一所，滬西二所，浦東二所，江灣一所，吳淞一所，虹口一所。與地方合辦者設備及入事管理由地方負責，冬令救濟會負擔柴米。各施粥所自元且日起先後開始施粥，可救濟三萬餘人。此外有流動施粥車一輛，每出動一次，可救濟二千人。至於施衣，目前僅限用各界所捐輸之舊衣，亦自元旦日起開始發放。截至目前，計往閘北，北站，蓬萊，長寗，靜安寺，四川路，江灣等區發放，共巳發放四萬一千六百餘件。至於最近婦女勸募寒衣志願團交來之棉衣五千套，其發放辦法尙待黃延芳提出意見後，再作決定。</p>
<p>隱貧救濟：在救濟經費項下劃出二億元充作隱貧救濟用途，因經費有限，故範圍不得不縮小，至今已核准之名單有六十餘戶，或發現金，或發食米。</p>

<h3 id="c121">贛東首城：上饒 <a href="#c121" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e121" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">121</a></h3>
<p>〔本報上饒一日訊〕在浙贛鐵路杭南段接通的前數天，記者帶着愉快的心境去訪問上饒。經過了十一個半鐘點的時間，侷處在破舊的鐵　車里，順簸得很厲害，給予每一個旅客的煩躁是難以設想的，常然記者也不能例外，好得坐在客車里，有一位健談的車守聊天，上下古今中外都談，也談到行將全綫逋車的浙贛鐵路，减少了許多無邊的寂寥，好容易挨過了這段不短的煩躁的時間，在午夜十二時許到達了這贛東的首城。爲了使睡得安穩些，　着寒風　進城去找到一個較潔凈的歇脚處，打發一天旅途的辛勞。</p>
<p>四度重臨舊地饒，覺街一切都變了。過去潔凈而繁鬧的都市雛型的外貌，已找不到什麼痕跡，如今留給記者一個零亂，骯監，破落的印象。上饒，過去是廣信府治之所在，城據信江的上游，爲贛省通閩浙之孔道。這里水陸交通都很方便，由信江上溯可達玉山，下流經貴谿，餘江而入鄱陽湖，可以貫通長江贛江二大河川。公路亦依此而成贛東之中心，經玉山可入浙，去閩省分二支，一由廣豐入閩，一經鉛山入閩，另有幹綫延經臨川吉安而入湘，更有一支直達南昌。並有浙贛鐵路貫通浙贛湘三省，因此，地處衝要，成爲贛東重鎭。</p>
<p>這個擁有</p>
<p>四十八萬居民的縣城，不藉口交通方便，物產也相當豐富，本地產梨及夏布均頗著名，其他廣豐的烟葉，玉山的粉絲，筍乾，鉛山的土紙，橫峯弋陽的雞鴨猪肉，南豐的橘子……所有贛東的土產，都在這里集散，轉口。本來在浙贛鐵路建築以前，鉛山河口鎭是贛東土產的集散市塲，自浙贛鐵路完成，上饒便分替了河口鎭一半的商業而成了贛東的商商業城。</p>
<p>上饒的商業區是在西門外的西大街，迤西至火車站附近爲止。一條長長的街道，齷齪到極點，滿街都是臭氣。路面是以條石舖成，中低旁高，且多羊角車輾成的軌跡，因此終年險濕不乾。街之兩旁，多二層的建築物，建造得很簡陋，俗氣，而且騎樓於人行道上，零零落落極不整齊，從市容上說，不雅觀極了。除西大街外，其他比較</p>
<p>熱鬧街道如勝利路，天井街，抗建路等也都在城外，城內沒有什麽熱鬧的街道。上饒雖爲前淸府治所在，但城圈不大，單以城東北的中山公園已幾乎佔去全城四分之一的面積；中山公園是全城最幽靜潔凈漕地區了，園內有一面積廣大的運動塲，有一所省立的醫事職校，二所小學，一座規模頗宏的中正紀念堂，還看一所贛東圖書館，這些建築，據說都是第三戰區長官司令部設此時的建築，如今雖景物依舊，而人事已非。例如贛東圖書館竟有名無實，室內桌椅均已塵封，圖書設備更不必談了。抗建紀念堂也駐上了不少的榮譽軍人，使重游者有不勝今昔之嘆。</p>
<p>在上饒住了幾天，覺得上饒的　文化事業是還够得上水準的了。這裏有一家民鋒日報，是贛省六區專署主辦的，日出對開一大張，可惜編排不甚美觀，副刋也嫌不够水準，發行也僅及贛省六區所轄各縣，但是却爲浙贛鐵路杭南段除杭州南昌二點之問僅有的一份對開報了。</p>
<p>此問敎育事業，也稱發達，有祝同，省立上中，省立醫職，縣中，縣師等六七隻中學。在勝利以前，上海的私立誠明文學院也曾遷此辦理過一段時期，勝利時遷回上海，旋即有贛省六區聯立信江農業專科學校的創辦，爲這山城綴上一顆寳石。在一年以前又遷到鉛山鵝湖去，最近該校學生正發起</p>
<p>回饒運動記者抵達上饒那些日子，剛好農專在醞釀學潮，學生自治會和校友會却派了代表到上饒來向各界呼籲，希望社會人士支持他們的「回饒運動」。依客觀的看法，信江農　有遷回這贛東政治經濟文化中心的上僥之必要，因爲一所專科學校侷處在叢山荒谷之間，遭受着物質條件的扼殺，使學校設備，師資延騁，書報供應等等都發生了問題，為求解決這些困難，使一所學校進步，記者也極贊同農專學生們戶的遷校要求。</p>
<p>在離開上饒的前夕，和一些上饒地方人士談起，浙贛鐵路貫通之後，放在眼前　還有</p>
<p>二個問題就治安與防疫。</p>
<p>到處土匪如毛的今日，作爲士匪老巢的廣　，與上德僅有五十華里的距離，所以廣　會不會再成土匪窩，是與贛東治安有不可分割的關係。據當地人士談，今日的贛東治安問題，還不曾達到嚴重的階段，似乎比起鄰近的閩北浙東，皖南都要好得多，只要基層政治機構不引起民怨，贛東是可以相當安定的。</p>
<p>防疫，在目下是上饒的一個切要問題，不久以前上　車站與沙漢鎭都蔓延了鼠疫，而且有燎原之勢，好得氣候寒冷，疫勢才稍殺，可是春季是有復發的可能的，這個黑色的威脅，使人不寒而慄，可是政府與人民都一樣短視，看不到病人，防疫工作也都停止了。</p>
<p>在歸途的車上，記者還祝福這山城的人民，能在安靜中復興，不再遭受鼠疫的威脅，使山城早日恢復繁榮。（本報記者蔣風）</p>

<p>〔本報蕪湖一日訊〕本市明遠電廠，每月燃管會核定之配煤數量，不敷實際需要遠甚。按月向燃管會要求預借次月煤斤，寅吃卯糧，以資維持。同時，晚間實行分區停電，俾可節省煤斤。地方人士，鑒於舊歷年關相近，冬防吃緊之際，一旦失却光明，深爲憂慮。電廠當局，也多方設法，爭取煤源。對於平漢路存蕪之煤一千四百五十噸，一再向該局購料處及燃營會交涉，幸已獲准。惟該項煤斤，應在一二月份配額內扣除，並須補繳運費卸力利息棧租等。開　煤之配價，原較淮南煤爲高，故該批煤斤，全部價款達六十億元，須繳淸後，方可發繳提單。電廠因數目過鉅，雖經竭力張羅，僅得三分之一，尙差三十餘億。若不能如期付淸，又恐平漢路局及燃管會籍口變卦，至爲焦灼。前日蕪市各軍政首長，地方耆紳，邀請各銀行，局，庫經理，共同商討辦法。最後由全體銀行局庫決定，共同貸與明遠電廠緊急貸款三十六億元，限期四十天，推定中國銀行爲代表行，負責辦理一切貸款手續。蕪湖電廠的煤荒，暫時得以解決，渡遜農曆的年關。</p>

<p>〔本報蘭州一日航訊〕上月廿九日晨二時二十五分，殘月斜照，寒星零落，蘭市河北　　子西北　紡　　，突然起火，　烟火舌，冲天而起，火勢最熾　　時候，火苗高達六七尺，因朔風鼓勢，梳毛部份的羊毛，又已拌過油料，且經上機，致使火熟不斷擴大，全部的機器房，紡手機，織呢機，完全浴於火海，霹霹拍拍的炸裂聲加辦着救火者的呼喊，附近人民驚怖的絕呌，火星趁烟柱不斷上昇，一時半天通紅，映照在黃河的冰流裏，悽慘而鮮　！</p>
<p>梳毛部冒濃烟</p>
<p>當火勢初起的時候，該廠警衛瞥見廠房梳毛部內目出濃烟，遂即大聲呼救，廠內員工從睡夢中驚覺，羣集起火地點，因廠房高大，又無救火工具，除奔走相吿外，袖手無策，警察第六分局靖遠路派出所聞及呼號，判明乃西北毛紡織廠失火，即以電話報告分六分局，總局消防隊及三·五分局等單位，請派人協助搶救，附近的憲兵隊，聯勤總部蘭州被服總廠，警備團第二營和當地機關，保田人員，都來協力撲救，一部份救火者蹈火疾舉屋頂，鋸，斧，火鈎齊舉，拆毁與火塲毗連之蒸染機房，隔離火勢，四部水龍並射火的中心，一部份警士並奮勇衝入火內，將室內堆存半絨品及機上原呢拖出屋外，經過三小時的努力，到今最六時半始大部熄滅，約略的統計，廠房六十七問，盡化灰燼，梳毛，紡毛，織呢等機器，大部付之一炬，損失常在兩千億元以上。</p>
<p>發覺遲　釀巨災</p>
<p>失火的原因，據推測係地下火道爆烈，火星生竄出，燃及堆積的羊毛所致。當時因晚間無電停工，工廠各門均反鎖在外，開始着火時並無一人發現，至待發現後，火舌已隨濃烟從窗口竄出，已到不可收拾的地步，遂釀成巨災。</p>
<p>甘省府郭主席今晨聞訊後，即以電話詢問經過，並加慰問，孫市長汝楠，警局李局長汝爲，均親往火塲勘視慰問。其他各機關，各團體首長，對此西北最大規模的民生工業遭遇到空前的損失，無不表示惋惜，紛紛前往慰問，記者於今日上午隨孫市長足履災區，由該廠代廠長秘書戚鶴年引導巡視一週，但見圯屋敗垣，瓦礫零散，機器殘體遍置院內，紗錠，原呢，隨處可見，廠房內猶有靑烟，隨風繚繞，數十員工，正挖掘殘餘的成品及機械。迤東一帶的蒸，染，洗等工作處所，幸未波及，烟內亦危立無恙。</p>
<p>兩月後可復工</p>
<p>關於火災情形，該廠已拍有紀錄照片，準備寄上海黃事會，今日下午三時許，戚代廠長即與上海劉董事長鴻生通話，報吿失火情形，惟以傳音不淸，並無結果，當晚即急常上海，詳陳損失情形及復興計劃。晚八時，戚氏復在私寓招待記者，除報吿起火之「推測」原因及失火經過外，並掩飾損失不若外傳二千餘億元之鉅，戚氏一再表示：倘上海中紡能撥出一部份機器，深信兩個月後可以復工，目前將以洗毛工作及承接客貨整染，以維持原有員工之生活，在可能條件之下，決不裁員，减工。該廠全體員工，決咬緊牙關，徐岡恢復舊觀！</p>
<p>戚氏於今日午後晋謁郭主席，面陳經過，據談郭主席表示：西北毛紡織廠爲西北唯一稍具規模之工業，在任何不利情形之下，省府決予有力援助，務使不致倒閉；郭主席希學該廠與京·　各董事接洽，再行決　援助辦法。該廠創始於三十四年，為滬上工商業鉅子駱清車，劉鴻生路氏投資開辦者，俾投前南財力以濟西北費　，由劉氏自在董事長兼總經理，平伯錄任協理兼廣長，目前正副經理均未在蘭，　務　秘書戚鶴年代理，即不幸發生此一巨災，為　州數十年來所未有。（記者宋麟）</p>

<p>平井榮三郞在這個異國義父的撫養下，從小學而中學而大學，因爲生得很聰穎，竟給他畢業日本帝國大學政經系。他的生活習慣，當然澈頭澈尾的日本化，甚至他不知道自己是個中國人。一直到他二十六歲時，他的母親病危，彌留時吿訴他眞正的里居姓氏，呌他有機會還是回到祖國來。他才知道他的可憐的身世。從那時起，他開始了返本的念頭，決心找到一個機會就回到祖國來。</p>
<p>調赴前綫</p>
<p>中日戰事爆發了，日本是個征兵制的國家，無論大學生或敎授，都要應征調赴前綫服役，不渦對文學生加以醫療人員訓練，畢業後隨軍服務，平井榮三郞也就做了醫療隊中的一員，隨着部隊踏進祖國大地，投人祖國的懷抱喪。</p>
<p>儘管祖國那時殘破得不成樣子，祖國的同胞是那樣不爭氣，但他還是熱愛着它，因爲他是中國人。</p>
<p>他到了漢口，因爲工作上的機會，給他認識了漢口司仁會醫院一位護士劉小姐。劉小姐是長沙人，她吿訴他臨湘在那一個方向，那裏有他祖宗的墳墓，那裏是他死去的母親日夕眷念着的故鄕。他興奮極了，就在一個夜晚，一個人　開部隊，逃到法租界去，但不幸那次是被日本憲兵捕獲了，他不依不能自由在的回到祖國來，而且做了囚徒．</p>
<p>戰地鴛鴦</p>
<p>日本憲兵隊將他嚴刑拷打，骨折肉　，三個月後才移送南京日本軍法會審，判處徒刑七年。在牢獄　關了幾個　，又被謂部隊服役。這次很幸運，還是與劉小姐在一塊，而且同在一個部隊服務。兩人工作在一起，日子久了，由友誼漸漸進人戀愛階段，最後在漢口宣佈結婚，成了一對患難相共的戰地鴛鴦。</p>
<p>臨湘投誠</p>
<p>民國三十二年日軍圖打通大陸交通，發動湘桂戰事，他　部隊開到了臨湖。這是他的故鄕，他再亦不　離開她了，於是在千方百計中和劉小姐一道陶到臨湘山中王剪波專員公署投誠。王專員給他査明了里居姓氏，一五相符，　家裏已經沒有了親人，僅有老屋數椽。同時他祗知道自己姓袁，還沒有中國名字。王專員於一是給他命名爲「昌亞」。從此他不是日本籍的平井榮三郞，而是由國人袁昌亞了。</p>
<p>袁昌亞雖然投入了祖國懷抱，是一個中國人了，可是按照戰時法，投誠過來的人並不能就此罷了，必須經過一番法律　續。王事員只好把他移送王　武司令部，王司令又把他移送湖南高等法院，法院以漢奸罪判他二年另六個月的徒刑。他剛剛脫離了異國的覊絆，回到祖國懷抱，竟不料福國不特不給他一點溫暖，反給他這份可咒的禮物。他在監獄裏，想到他留在臨湘的妻子，已經生了一個孩子，手邊沒有一點積蓄，全靠兩隻手在鄕間種地檢柴，苦度生活；他又想到他埋骨異域的母親，和同母異父的妹妹，……同時想到自己的悲慘命運。他悲觀了，在獄中，幾乎拿出日本人自殺的勇氣來，想了結這一條受難的生命。幸經同監難友的勸阻，沒有自殺成功；同時他是受過高等敎育，還經過一段艱苦的奮鬥歷程，租國需要他這種人才。他接受了衆人的勸吿後，開始向一條新的途徑上跑了。</p>
<p>監獄生活</p>
<p>高等法院判了池二年〇六個月的徒刑，問監中有人帮他提起上訴，因爲他五歲隨母入了日本籍他自己不知道他是一個中國人。後來知道了，也還是連一個中國名字都沒有，他的隨部隊到祖國來，正是他想藉機回到祖國，他如何甘願受法院以漢奸　名的處分呢？經過最高法院的覆判，刑期减半。這在他雖然是仍所不甘，但有什麼辦法？他只好在監裏守法。在監裏，他們規　矩，處處反映出有敎養。他努力研究由國文字，準備出獄後可以獻身於祖國。本月初他的刑期滿了。他走出監獄的大門，這次才是他眞正呼吸到祖國的自由空氣，可是，他在長沙舉目無親，身無分文，這個陌生的所在，呌他到那裏去存身呢？幸虧天主堂醫院看護方北覩君，曾一度和他同坐過監獄的難友，知道這個可憐虫的際遇，特地把他接到家裏信下，幷由天主堂醫院同仁，共湊了三百餘萬元，使他能够回臨湘與他久別而正在磨難中的妻子會面。</p>
<p>新生機運</p>
<p>袁昌亞出獄後在長沙住了幾天，就回了臨湘。他在獄中和日本家裘通了信，知道他的義父已經被炸死了，大哥從軍陣亡，二哥當了公司裏的大班，他的一位同母的妹妹已由醫專畢業，嫁組一個工程師，他在日本還有一份家產，他準備回日本去料理一番，解決他目前的經濟困難。他今年三十三歲，正當有為之年，他有學問，有抱負，有良好的生活習慣，身體也很結實，記者經友人的介紹，在他臨別長沙的一天晤見了他，他的中國話尙講得不十分流利，他在痛陳了他的過去後，很堅決的表示，他對祖國一點也不失望，相反，獻給祖國，只要祖國不遺棄他</p>
<p>元月下旬的一個淸晨，他寂寞地搭上了長武快車回臨相去了。當軍子徐離站以到消失在天邊時，記者蒼茫地遙望着，默默地爲他祝福：朋友，去罷，爲你的理想去奮鬥，祖國不會遺棄你，只要你有勇氣繼續奮鬥，擅在面前的不是一條康莊大道嗎？（特派員黃潮如）</p>

<p>【神州社社讯】本市中國科學社消息：國立中山大學天文系主任張子春敎授，去歲出國赴美哈佛大學天文台硏究，十二月在鹿豹座南端，赤徑四度五分，赤緯五十三度十四分所在，發見新變星一夥。此新發現，已引起世界天文台普遍的注視與興趣，允稱我天文學者在國外無上榮譽。哈佛天文台長沙普利博士，當即將發見經過，通電吿知全世界各大天文台。此新發現變星，曾先爲美國葉凱士天文台得曼博士所注意，經檢驗光譜結果，知該星與北冕座R型變星相似，預料其爲另一變星，但未得事實證明。其後張敎授檢閱此星所在區域照片逾八百頓，時期自一八九八年以迄現在，卒於儒略日二·四二九·五九六至二·四二九·六七六日間·獲得此星亮度最小時所在區域，證明其確屬變星，並求得其光度最小値在一九四〇年一月十七日，約爲國際攝影星等十·三〇等，平均亮度則爲八·七〇等，屬K型，其他特性尙在硏究中。按目前已知宇宙中變星約二萬餘顆，而北冕座R型變星亮度變化無一定週期，故極難發現，迄今所知者僅十餘顆左右，此型星表面溫度極高，外圍濛氣含碳素甚多，故又稱熱碳星，全型星光譜目G型至K型具超巨星特性。</p>

<p>昨天，應友人的邀約，從上海搭祥生公司的汽車到七寳。一下車，就看見上海市立七寶農業職業學校的招生的廣吿。穿渦熱鬧的大街，繞到鎭的南市梢，一彎溪水，展着淺笑迎人；緣溪東行被緩緩底溪流環抱着的，是緩橫好幾幢半宮殿式的房屋。白的粉牆，靑的瓦頂，朱紅的廊柱，淺綠的水管，蒼翠的松和銀杏，這個角度的景色，太逗人愛羨　七寶農校終於到達了，由傳達者的引領，記者在會客室裏坐下，那位一見面就使人感到親切的校長柴子飛先生，就進來與記者握手歡叙，並且陪同參觀。</p>
<p>柴校長四十上下的年紀，滿面紅光，英氣煥發，一雙晶亮的跟睛充份顯露他的英明才幹。他是本地人，生於農家，任西成小學校長已十多年，現任市黨部執委及市參議員，是滬上極活躍有地位的人物，去年因地方人士的擁戴出而主特創校的一切事宜。學校是市立的，但市敎育經費拮据，根本拿不出一個錢來，柴校長奔走　劃，終於從無中生出有來：房屋多幢是破敗的廟宇修建改造的；農田百畝，是地方慈善機關三善堂捐助的；其他開辦費用，是向地方人士勸募的。七寳地方，在從前是市縣交界的所在，情形十分複雜，幸因柴校長領導其間，任何人才都樂　襄成其事　因爲道是新創的學校，目前只開初高級各兩班，初級有一百多人，高級有六十餘人。初級課程，除注重農業勞作一科外，其餘都是和普通中學一樣　；到高級本學期多讀作物，畜牧，土壤肥料等農業踝程。一個星期要上四十二節課，比起普通中學幾乎要多上四分之一，這不能不說是很繁重。</p>
<p>農業學校是　該　　的　工作，記者就要求柴校長引導去看農塲的設施，但他告訴我這學期最引爲不足的就是農塲尙未設備起來。他引記者約到溪流的南端。指着遠處田隴　　株柏樹爲界，他說道一帶共有田　百　，是預備作爲農塲用的。因爲有許多田還須與農民交換，幾經磋商，最近辦妥手續　已有六十多畝，到春熟收起時就可歸校裏耕種。柴校長指東劃西地告知記者：那裏預備　畜舍，那裏預備建花房，何處是苗圃，何處是農塲辦公室，……種種建設計劃，詳加闡述。記者面對這一方田畝，就柴校長的計劃，想像其建設完成時的情景、深信三四年內一定可以創造出一幅美麗的圖實來。</p>
<p>在現有校舍東面的一方田地上，柴校長又指點給我下學期新建校舍的圖樣，敎室六間，實驗室，大禮堂，宿舍等等，還有運動塲，他就土木工程上，要記者參加意見，那我是十足外行，只能訥訥無以爲對</p>
<p>最後記者詢以農校設立與地方人民生活關係的問題，柴校長就一本正經吿訴記者說：校裏巳與農林部棉產改進處及病虫藥械製造實驗廠訂立合同，今年以一千畝棉田爲目標，從事推廣美棉的種植，物資由改進處與實驗廠供給，人力則由農校全體師生負責推廣。今年一千畝試驗有成時，明年當可增至六千畝。此外產銷合作社亦在組織中，成立後將向中央合作金庫貸款，以爲農業產銷之資金，一面另由若干地方人士，發起籌設農民敎育實驗區，已造　計劃呈請市敎育局核示。總之，農校的成立，是從困難中半長起來的，每克服一次困難，辦事的興趣更能增進一層。目前所困難的，是經費的籌措，各項建築費用總計需款四十餘億，下學期總須在沒辦法中想辦法，一一逐步完成。</p>
<p>記者以時　所限，不得不吿辭而退。這次參觀所得印象，猶如看了一部美國田納西河農村建設的電影，精神興奮非凡。在今日的中國，要談　植國本，還有什麼事比發展農業生產更重要更切實的呢！這個學校是本市農業教育的曙光，也是中國新農業成長的搖籃，不但哺乳的柴校長有責任要愛護他，養育他，我想每一們有力量的中國人也都有責任，要供給這個甯繫兒以滋養，使他健康，使他發育。（黃寒波）</p>

<p>（一四）公路上</p>
<p>（由廣西到貴州的公路）</p>
<p>大隊難民沿路走着。郭燦　，秀貞也雜在羣衆中逃難。</p>
<p>（一五）廣西貴州邊界之六寨</p>
<p>（三十三年十一月底）</p>
<p>難民，傷兵，軍隊充滿了這一小小的市鎭。到處都是人，都是車，都是難民攤子，種種不一而足。忽然放警報，人民驚慌失措，紛紛逃避。燦雲和秀貞也雜在人叢之中，「特寫」此刻手中還有一個小箱和一個包袱，接着高射砲聲見彼時在人叢中爭扎亂跑，因敵機羣發現於上空。「特寫」緊接即是投彈　炸聲，四處濃烟起火，鎭上房屋多被炸燬，死傷甚衆。燦雲滿身灰土，面無人色，祇提着一個包袱，小箱子顯然己經失落。大聲的呌「秀貞！秀貞！秀貞！秀貞！」然無人應。急得一面哭，一面逢人便問，有沒有看見一個七八歲的女孩子，人皆說不曾看見。燦雲四處尋找，又到許多被炸死的屍苜中去辨認也毫無下落。另一方面有一輛紅十字會的救濟車停在被轟炸區附近，救護人員將受傷的婦孺一個個抬上汽車，汽車裝滿了十數人，即開走了。秀貞即被紅十字會救濟車救去的一個，燦雲剛剛錯過，怕以得不着秀貞的下落。</p>
<p>（一六）貴州都勻難民救濟會</p>
<p>燦雲（此刻的燦雲已經是三十七八歲了）逃到都勻，不特疲弊不堪，且已成爲一個百分之百的難民，已看不出是一位富家太太。他到難民救濟曾去探問女兒消息，走入一辦公室，見着一位幹事正在那裏辦公，室內有很多難民。</p>
<p>燦雲：請問先生，您是辦理難民救濟的吧？</p>
<p>幹事：是的，你有什麽事？</p>
<p>燦雲：我是由桂林逃難到這裏來的，在六寨被敵機轟炸的時候，把我的女兒散失了。一路找到此地都沒有消息，現在大家都逃到貴陽去，我在那裏無親無戚逃了去也沒有辦法，我有親戚在湖南洪江，不知道這裏有法子去沒有？</p>
<p>幹事：有的，離此地不遠就有水路到洪江，你可以乘民船去。</p>
<p>燦雲：可是先生，我有點錢和貴重的東西都在六寨丟了，（很難的情形），我現在沒有錢了。……</p>
<p>幹事：那不要緊，我們有難民船送難民下去。你願搭船，我可以給你乘船證。</p>
<p>燦雲：我願意。</p>
<p>幹事：（即刻塡寫一張乘船證，交給她。）明天有好風隻船要開。請你明天一早就到救濟會來，這裏有人帶你到乘船的地方去。</p>
<p>燦雲：證謝你：（拿了乘船證出來。）</p>
<p>（一七）貴陽市街　（三十三年十二月四日下午。）</p>
<p>貴陽市大街廣塲的一角，很多的人慌慌張張的來來往往，大家都表露着驚惶憂　不知所措的神情，許多人在交頭接耳。由他們的各種表現可以看出大家都認為大局已經無望的樣子。忽然一個報童大虧叫賣號外。</p>
<p>報僮：（左臂下抱着一捲報。右手拿一張號外高舉着，一面走一面喊。）號外！號外！五塊錢一張！賣號外！敵人到了獨山！前方部隊在平舟堅强抵抗！（許多人聽了報僮的叫喊聲，更緊張起來，大家搶着買號外。若干人買了以後，報僮叫着走遠了。）</p>
<p>某甲（買得號外，看了以後。）聰說另外有一般敵人已經到了都勻附近。所以都勻附近那一座大橋都已經炸毁了，要是抵擋不住敵人，那怎麼辦？</p>
<p>某乙，怎麽辦？你想逃嗎？逃到那裏去？聽說蔣委負長派何總長來坐鎭貴陽，昨天已經到了。湯總司令也到前綫指揮去了。鬼子們深入了貴州山地，包他們來送死。怕什麽？</p>
<p>（一八）緊急會議　（三十三年十二月十日）</p>
<p>大約下午四時左右。貴陽黨政軍各界領袖約二三十人在一間會議室舉行一個對於應付時局的緊急會議。會議進行到中途。張副司令趕到。</p>
<p>主席：（會議的主席），現在時局是這樣緊急，剛才決定的許多事，希望大家負責努力分頭去執行。……</p>
<p>（主席方說完，張副司令入會議室，向大家打招呼。主席請張副司令在他的右邊一張椅上坐下，繼續發言。）</p>
<p>現在張副司令到了，我們請他給我們講一講前綫　情形。（大家拍掌表示歡迎。）</p>
<p>司令：（起立報吿）主席，諸位先生，第一件要報吿大家的是前綫戰事已經穩定下來了。（大家聽了高興，掌聲四起。）</p>
<p>兄弟今天早晨晨由馬塲坪趕回貴陽。獨山的敵人，的確已經被我們打退了。我軍已於昨日下午克復獨山城。都勻附近二十里的敵人受我陸空兩軍的反攻，也往南潰退了，現在正迫擊之中。所以軍事方面，請諸位放心。但是都勻，貴定，龍里這一帶，大約有十幾萬難民像潮水一般的向貴陽湧來，到了以後，不但住的成問題，吃的更成問題。要是處置不好，貴陽治安實在可慮。我昨晚用電話報吿過何總長，不知大家已經商量好辦法沒有？</p>
<p>主席；關於這件事，昨天會議已經決定組織一個傷兵難民救濟委員會，負責辦理一切，現在一面預備住所，所有貴陽市各機關，各學校，各大住宅，都可以佈置爲難民招待所，同時我們也考盧了如何遺送難民的辦法。這於交通大有關係，正在與後方勤務部商量之中，這一位就是我們救濟委員會的主任顧先生。（顧與張稍爲招呼。）</p>
<p>司令：這樣很好，前綫拚命是我們軍人的責任，後方的一切可得偏勞諸位了。（說畢坐下）</p>
<p>主席：謝謝張副司令給我們帶來的好消息，今天會議完畢希望大家分頭努力去準備一切吧。（主席起立散會。）</p>
<p>（十九）貴陽近郊</p>
<p>（卅三年十二月中旬）</p>
<p>冰天雪地，氣候嚴寒，公路兩旁田地中可以看見殘雪，遠遠的山頭上也有積雪。貴陽市附近公路上，成千成萬的難民，像潮湧一般，往貴陽城前進。老少男女皆有，除少數壯健之外，大多數都是面帶菜色，顯然是逃難多時而未獲一飽的。最大多數的是扶老携幼的步行。偶爾也發現一輛破舊小汽車，裏面裝滿了似乎有錢的逃難者，車後車上都綑載着包袱舖蓋行李等。忽然又來了一兩架滑竿，上面抬着老的或病的難民。一輛大卡車上面裝滿了超過了能裝載的人數，一個個都像有病的樣子。許多步行的人，都用着各色各樣的手杖。有竹子做的，有用一條小太頭做的，也有眞像手杖的。逃難的人所穿的衣服，奇形怪狀，不一而足；除了偶有少數穿得還好的以外，大多數都是破舊的。最引人哭笑不得的是有滿顋鬍子的老頭兒，穿着女人的旗袍。有許多女難民也居然穿了軍服，有的女難民上身穿一件短軍服，單在旗袍之外，也有男女難民穿着長服而頭上戴着軍帽，有丈夫拉着馬，老婆騎在馬上的，也有小孩騎在牛背上旁邊有父兄照料着走的，偶爾也見一個居然着了高跟皮鞋，慢步拖着走的年靑女郞，許多人連草鞋都沒有了。用破布棉花包着脚走的，有壯年扶着老年人走的，有男女背着小孩走的，有一母親帶着變個兒女走的，惟恐走散，而用繩子將兒女　在腰間的，也有天眞爛漫活潑的小孩子莫明其妙的跟着大家走的，難民們帶着各種行李，無奇不有，有的是難民自已提着，挑着，也有的兩人抬着，在許多難民當中，常常雜着一些退下來的士兵，有軍服尙整齊的，有不整齊的，有帶着步槍手槍的，也有徒手的，也常見着紅十字會的卡車載着傷兵和傷病的難民在難民羣中慢慢　前進，喇叭烏烏叫，使難民讓路。</p>
<p>貴陽市內，這裏可以看見一棟大建築，左邊的牌子是「貴陽財政廳」，右邊的掛着「第一難民招待所」另一處左邊掛着「貴州省黨部」右邊掛着「第五難民招待所」，再一處左邊掛着「靑年團貴州支團部」，右邊是「第三難民招待所」上邊加「明星大戲院」下面「第二十二難民招待所」，左邊「貴州日報社，右邊是「文化人招待所」等等。</p>
<p>有一建築大門前掛的是「第一難民醫院」。（未完）</p>

<p>— 趙景深</p>
<p>土耳其的文壇</p>
<p>土耳其的作家在戰時和現在都傾向美國特別是在杜魯門任總統的時候。過去，土耳其是傾向英國的。</p>
<p>土耳其的美國傾向可以從最近的一本書裏看出來，那就是年靑的土耳其女作家梭裕庫特（Sakibe　Soyukut）所寫的「夢鄕」（Dreamiand）。她在美國讀書，回土耳其後，便把這神奇的西方國土吿訴她的同胞們。這本書帶有好萊塢的派頭——但這正是土耳其通借的市塲所需要的。在安可拉（Ankara）的商人眼中，所謂「美國的」是最易於銷售的貨物。哪怕明明是英國貨，呌賣縫針的女孩也要高喊呌「美國的」！</p>
<p>關於美國，已經有好幾本書譯成土耳其文。最成功的就是班特萊（Phyllis　Bentley）女士的「這是美國」（Ishte　Amerika），還有法國作家莫洛瓦（AndreMaurois）所寫的「美國史」，還有一太泛論美國的文章的結集，原來都是在土耳其最暢銷的伐丹（Vatan）報上刋登過的。</p>
<p>土耳其的書市差不多跟着美國的暢銷書走，例如小羅斯福（ElliottRoosevelt）的譯本用了一個奇怪的名字「我承認」，直拉夫飮科的「我選擇自由」也譯出來了。華萊士（Henry　Wallace）的「人民的世紀」（The　Century　of　the　Common　Man）（譯文名Halk　Asri）也出版了。威爾基（Wendell　Willkie）的「天下一家」（One　World）譯名爲Tek　Blr　Dunya。</p>
<p>安哥拉的書商說起，美國書最暢銷的是賽珍珠和白羅姆費爾德（Bromfield）的作品。最暢銷的美國通俗小說是溫紫（Kathleen　Winsor）女士的「虎魄」（Forever　Amber）。土耳其的譯本只譯「琥珀」（Amber）一辭，這名詞是土耳其採自阿刺伯的。</p>
<p>至於土耳其本國的文學，仍極狹隘，不能與西方等量齊觀。國外知名的只有一位女作家愛逖白（Halide　Edib），現在她正在伊坦布爾（Istanbul）敎書，她把新土耳其本國與國際問題介紹給西方。除她以外，其餘的作家恐怕只有本國知道了。</p>
<p>現代的土耳其作家都是絕對國家主義的。在凱末爾統治時，還沒有國家的覺醒，因爲當時國家尙多，土耳其僅其中之一，不過是較大的國家罷了。有人替現在的總統伊諾弩（Ismet　Inonu）寫了一本傳記，此外最近出版品中是關於土耳其藝術，考古，歷史和敎有的。土耳其已轉向到盧騷的敎育，他的「愛彌兒」也已經譯出來了。</p>
<p>土耳其讀書的人很多，賣書頗能獲利。任何都市都有很多的書店，不過原版西書極少，恐怕是受了外匯的影響。土耳其政府不大注意圖書館，最大的設立在安哥拉的衆議院，新書極少，還趕不上美國的中學圖書館。美國新聞處在大使館裏設立了一個圖書館，大部分人民都不與它接近。</p>
<p>土耳其人極想知道現代美國文學，還希望美國的文學敎授能够去敎書，並且希望能大量地交換敎師和學生。</p>

<p>— 君左</p>
<p>我是一月十九日從上海飛到　州的。一下飛機就覺得氣候有些陰陽怪氣，萬里晴空，而晶冷竟如峨眉山頂。到飛機塲接客的朋友，一個個皮包毛裹，僅僅露出一段眉目，可以辨別。這晚我在寓所洗脚上床，第二天早晨一看，洗脚水凍成氷塊了。</p>
<p>我回蘭州已一星期。就這一週論，天天都在零下十七八度。蘭州的市容是一種淡淡的粉琢銀裝，像一個瓊樓玉宇高處不勝寒的絕代佳人。大街小巷，氷花雪塊，觸目皆是。行人蜷縮像一隻刺蝟。割耳的東風冷得可怕，老人的鬍鬚已有一些凍成氷鈎。</p>
<p>給予東南人士的奇幻的印象便是西北下雪的風韻逈乎不同凡響。前天夜裏，皓月當空，織塵不染，而霏霏白雪，在月光中盪漾，皋蘭山雄峙南方，輝映在月光下雪光中，還隱隱籠罩一層薄霧。如此奇景，江南何曾見到？昨天早晨推窗一望，好大的太陽，雪仍是那樣瘋狂地飛舞，　層繽紛，把整個的蘭州來一個素描。儘管陽光普照，雪並沒有溶化，一層舖一層，一夜之間，有四五寸厚了，就像磨粉一般，見不、着六出銀花。如此奇眾，江南何曾見到？</p>
<p>一邊出太陽，一邊出月亮，一邊下雪，這是什麼道理？氣候學家能否啓示我一點玄機？久住蘭州的人司空見慣了，並不覺得奇幻。只有孤淸的人，遠征的客，才有些新穎的感觸。</p>
<p>儘管氣候如此嚴寒，若與上海來比吧，蘭州的冬天仍然是可愛的。一般機關和住家大都燃着煤爐。距蘭州市很近有一個阿千鎭，盛產煤，全市的溫暖就靠着它，阿干鎭的「民主保長」即甘肅省郭寄嶠主席。儘管室外是零下十七八度的低溫，而室內經常保暖如溫煦的陽春，穿一件薄薄的棉袍也就够了。煤的市價最近是一百六十萬一噸，上海呢？上海一般燒不起煤，最大的旅館慳吝着水汀之開放。在上海，室外冷，室內冷，而蘭州不然，只要你出門皮包毛裏的裝扮一下，則嚴寒的襲擊終歸無用。</p>
<p>冬的蘭州並不枯寂。配合着漫天氷雪，滑氷運動風行一時。中山林和文化心臟區的蘭園各有一個較大的滑氷塲所，整千百的人終日溜着；在沒有全凍的黃河上，在田野間，在廣塲裏到處都是天然的氷塲，到處看見溜氷的勇士。西北的人們是不怕冷，吃得苦，有幹勁，跌了交，摔了腰，截斷了脛骨，還是照樣的溜氷，直溜到雪花不飛氷溶解，這大概已是春二三月了。那時節，「忽然一夜東風來，千樹萬樹梨花開」，他們又快到安寗堡賞桃花去了。似使蘭州溜氷的「永刀」不賣一百幾十萬一雙，平民化一點，則此種冬季康樂運動必更加熱烈而普遍。</p>
<p>我懷念上海，更懷念上海的友人。在漫天烽火中，在漫天氷雪中，我把這大西北一角中豪放激盪的熱情送給我的朋友，就當做煤來燃燒吧。（一月二十六日寄自蘭州）</p>

<p>六歲的孩子曼文以前笨極不堪，一年之前，不論是簡單的推食解衣，和其他小孩玩耍，都顯得曼文是個低能的孩子。</p>
<p>他的父母對於曼文已感絕望，料想將來長大成人，縱不低能，也是白痴。有一個醫師請他試服一種治腦的新藥。</p>
<p>曼文自從吃了這種東西之後，心理上的幼稚狀態逐漸消滅。他能够穿鞋，扣鈕子，和同歲數的小孩玩耍。如其他能這樣繼續進步下去，長大之後，其智力就能與常人相同。</p>
<p>此刻的確有一樣可以售給大腦作爲食料的東西。這是科學家最近的發現：從蛋白質裏提煉出來的「格　泰寗克酸素」。服下之後，可以使小孩聰敏智　。</p>
<p>請一批智能落後的孩子，吃一種包含有這種「大腦食品」的食物，用智力測驗來一試，便覺他們能獲得顯著的進步。事實上，其中有幾個孩子的心理發展，比了同年　的正常兒童更快。</p>
<p>格　泰密克酸素據硏究所得，是氨基酸素中直接可以和腦組織發生同化的唯一化學劑。酸素與腦組織發生了化學作用之後能够轉爲微細的電力，促進神經活動與思想進步。紐約有三位科學家正在作格魯泰密克酸素對於智力關係的研究。</p>
<p>他們挑選九個孩子，在六個月中給他們吃格魯泰密克酸素，固然在智力方面有了顯著進步。第一個月的智力測驗平均得分一〇七，六月個之後，平均得分一二〇。</p>
<p>有一個二歲的小孩，智能只及八個月的孩子。經過了半年的服用格魯泰密克酸素之後，小孩在智力上的發展，超過了六個月中應有的發展。還有一個孩子的智力等於他的實際年齡：四歲。經過吃了這種新藥物以後的六個月，他的智能等於一個六歲又四個月的正常孩子。</p>
<p>這種新氨基酸素能够改良人類思考力的實驗，還是第一次。最初是拿老鼠來實驗的。吃過酸素的老鼠，能够在錯綜複雜的路徑中找到放有食物的匣子，所費時間比不吃酸素的老鼠快一倍。</p>
<h3 id="c183">成分 <a href="#c183" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e183" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">183</a></h3>
<p>— 方仁</p>
<p>公敎人員的日用必需品，米煤糖油鹽中，以煤爲最傷腦筋；購運的不便，不必說了，而常把煤球放入爐子中去燒的時候，却是一百個燒不着；好容易燒着了，火勢也是薄弱得很，無論燒茶煮飯，總得大半天才有動靜，若是要趕着吃了飯去上班，那往往會上當。爲了燒煤球，家里人不知道出了多少怨言，但是旣然配來如此，實在無話可說。</p>
<p>這自然是成分問題。因爲煤球原是用煤和泥配合起來的，煤多易燒，泥多難燒，火勢微弱，是一定的道理。</p>
<p>化驗煤球的成分，想來並非難事，只是沒有人去注意，而煤商也就肆無忌憚了。</p>
<p>記得幼年時，因身體虛弱，大人們時常令我進服中藥的補丸；補丸的仿單上，雖然對於藥性說明各有不同，但有兩句話，却是千篇一律。那兩句什麼話呢？就是「修合雖無人見，存心自有天知。」因爲藥丸的眞假，表面上確是看不出來，至於後效也是很微，但憑了這兩句話，大家也就信之無疑，或許那時人心厚道些，對於丸子配合的成分，當不至於相差太遠。</p>
<p>所可惜的，現在的煤商旣不像過去那些藥商那樣憑着「天知」的存心，科學的應用又還不習慣；莫怪煤球中應該多含些煤的成分，却儘變了泥，自來水中不應該含有鹽汁，却偏是鹽汁了。</p>
<h3 id="c184">謝歲有感 <a href="#c184" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e184" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">184</a></h3>
<p>— 念鴻</p>
<p>每到一年終了，總有謝歲之舉，這種半帶着迷信氣息的風俗，在我們民族中間生定了根，縱然國曆制定了三十多年，可是事實上農曆年關一近，香燭店裏的紙糊元寳和小菜塲上的鷄鴨魚肉，都漲起了幾倍，這年頭雖是到處喊着市面不景氣，而相沿成習的謝歲祭神，却是依然故我，盛况不减。</p>
<p>人所以稱爲聰明的動物者，神道們的責任，因爲神道是永遠就是處處地方計算精明，善於用最低的代價換取最大的報酬。而我們炎黃子孫，更是聰明不過，即使在被譽爲至高無上聖潔純明的神道之前，也照樣把一套人間的頂上工夫，用得恰到好處，必恭必敬地三跪九叩之外，還少不了三牲祭犧，酒菜菓品，最後在淸香紅燭中，大串的金銀元寳與紙錠冥鈔，焚化送行，美其名曰「孝敬」，虔誠地敬酒默禱，祝望明年能够萬事如意，時來運來。想把紙製的東西換成實物，倒眞呌做「抛磚引玉」，實在是聰明絕頂的舉動；而雞鴨菜肴，更是祭祀敬神其名，自飽口腹其實，可惜的是，所謂神道也者是否全屬子虛，抑或旣尊爲神祗，不爲利祿所動。事實上，每年每戶總是謝歲祭神，但每年每戶却並不見得個個豐衣足食。相反的，除了少數中的少數能够突然暴發之外，大都每况愈下，一年不如一年，小康之家淪爲勉强糊口，而勉强糊口的却已　飱不繼了。</p>
<p>然而謝歲的依然謝歲，因爲今年固已命運多舛，而來日方長，總希望明年能够豁然開朗。基於這一個希望，所以香燭元寶雖貴，却斷乎不可缺少，祈禱的時候也分外虔敬，對今年的　楣不敢有半句怨語，只是磕而如搗蒜，把希望寄托於俗未來。</p>
<p>分外虔敬的結果，却是分外的窘困，但死心塌地的人們，並不想到這是天神每年受了　禮而不給一毫酬報，還始終認爲自已叩頭的態度欠恭正，款待的酒菜欠　　，以致為神所遷怒。反過來想，假使自已確是發乎至誠，那末「誠則靈」，「皇天不負苦心人」，神道們對於些微的願望，總可以「有求必應」了。</p>
<p>到了最後，如果是自問正心誠意的功夫，已經做到了十二分，而酒菜祭品，也已經竭盡心力傾我所有，但是窘困的狀况，却變本加厲的話，那過失當然仍非不會錯的，錯的只是自已前生的「命」。</p>
<p>這就是年年謝年年年窮的理由。</p>
<h3 id="c185">黃包車夫與舞女 <a href="#c185" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e185" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">185</a></h3>
<p>— 鮑忠祚</p>
<p>有一天，我走過某舞應，看見一個打扮得很摩登的女子與黃包車夫正在口角，當然，這種情形一望而知是在爭執着車資，類似這種爭吵的情形，走在上海街道的人們雖然已經司空見慣，不足爲奇，但是按照這兩個主角的身份外表看來，這鏡頭顯然地有些不調和。</p>
<p>於是，我想像：黃包車夫的身份已可確定無疑，他拉着車子，撇開了兩條腿，滿街飛奔，是爲了生活的驅使，他與顧客的爭車資，在善良的黃句車夫立塲上看，是情有可願的；相反的，　得無厭不講信用的黃包車夫，他與顧客的爭吵是不値得同情的。</p>
<p>再說那個打扮得花枝招展的摩登女性吧，我雖不知道她倒底是怎麽樣一種人，可是據我猜想起來，大槪屬於舞女之流，由於這樣的一個假定，我不禁產生了很多的感想。</p>
<p>姑且不論他們爭吵的是非，且看他們環境的遭遇：黃包車夫和舞女的外相雖然絕不相同，前者是衣衫襤褸，赤足履地，窮兇極惡，寒酸之至；後者則服飾華麗，高跟皮鞋，「美不勝收」。然而仔細一想，黃包車夫與舞女固同是天涯淪落人也，以「脚力」換取生活，皆不得已也，圓　方趾都同，兩人何必爭吵？</p>
<p>還記得年前「黃包車將逐漸抽　淘汰」之禁令否？與今日「舞廳將逐漸予以停業」豈非相同？雖然，黃包車之至今猶馳行上海灘，吾且不論；九月底之舞廳是否完全禁止，也因時日未屆，不得而知，若照現實看來，則黃包車夫與舞女又有何不同？</p>
<p>我曾經產生過一個妄想，假使把舞女在舞池中迴繞婆娑的次數累積起來，那末在她脚底下所經過的路程，實在是一個可驚的數字，也許可以與黃包車夫相埓也說不定，所不同的祗是黃包車夫的拉車是「向量」的，而舞女的翩翩飛舞不過在池中團團轉，除了娛樂以外，沒有其他目的可言。</p>
<p>舞女只有一個靑春，年華一老，容貌便衰，像一個老態龍鍾的黃包車夫一樣，有多少人會來理睬你呢？</p>

<p>第九章　洩漏機密（六二）</p>
<p>肖柏聽了，又好氣又好笑，當下又敷衍幾句，渚齋見沒什麽事，又忙忙走了。肖柏等渚齋去後，一個人坐在屋內，把這事細細一硏究，覺得渚齋如不得家庭許可，雙雙出走，到外面結婚，這是很可能的事，要阻止這事，當然須要渚齋的父親出面，才名正言順，但是他若處置不好，反要促成更壞的結果。肖柏爲了這事，坐一會躺一會，抽了好風根香烟，最後才想出一個主意。因爲今夜館子裏沒戲，吃過飯，已是九點多鐘，坐車一直趕到徐毓如家裏，因爲知道毓如的脾氣是很嚴正，很躁急的，若把這事全吿訴他，毓如一定要大發脾氣，呌渚齋回來，罵了一頓，事情更要弄糟，所以見面不敢直說，先談些閑話，後來慢慢査問渚齊近狀，毓如便發牢騷道：「我的腦筋，自信很開通的，自渚齋成家之後，我認爲由他在外面組織小家庭，好呌他多得些經驗，你的二姊就不贊成，我的主張，近來不但這位兒媳婦不來，連渚齊也不照面了！你二姊儘日埋怨我，說娶了一個兒媳婦，丟了一個好兒子，現在是這種時代，家家如此，這有什麽辦法呢！」肖柏笑道：「他們二人，能組織一個完滿小家庭，未嘗不是好事，只怕任着他們年靑的脾氣在外胡幹，那就不如呌他們搬回家來同住，在你們督導之下，倒知道居家接物待人道理。「肖柏剛說到這裏，毓如的太太早接說道：「二第這話不錯，我也是這樣看法，一做新媳婦進門，總要呌他知道一切家庭的規矩，分開居住，是不妥當的。」肖柏道：「這其中有好也有壞，祗看他們怎麼幹吧。我有一句話吿訴你們，不過這是傳聞的，並不確實，你二位聰了，不要生氣。」毓如夫婦很注意問道：「可是渚齋在外鬧什麼笑話嗎？」肖柏道：「據我聽說，渚齊一對小夫婦，並不十分和睦。」毓如道：「這個我也有所聞。」肖柏道：「近來在鬧離婚，原因是渚齋要另娶一人。」毓如聽了，沉不住氣，暴躁道：「這還了得嗎，非呌回來嚴行管敎一番不可。」肖柏道：「我說你不用生氣呀！你知道渚齋要娶的是什麼人？」毓如道：「我想一定是章雲卿，他們從小兒就在一起，這次渚齋結婚，是迫於情勢，很勉强的，這情形我都看得很淸楚。」肖柏道：「你猜錯了，渚齋縱有此心，人家名門閨秀，未必肯作奪婿之舉。不是她，是現在梨園界鼎鼎有名的顧綺紈。」毓如駭然道：「什麼！顧綺紈？這名字我在報紙上常見的，渚齊要娶她，太沒道理了。」</p>

<p>— 毛毅</p>
<p>人類學家對於長頭的人與圓頭的人兩者之間智力的高低已經辯論得許久了。現在，「美國自然歷史博物院」的弗郞茲·魏頓里區傳士經過不斷的研究，力斥道兩派學者都在浪費他們的時間。魏頓里區博士拿出有力的證據，推翻了一百年前瑞典的解剖學家安德斯頓修所創的「頭顧型」的謬論。</p>
<p>賴修認爲種族的優劣可用頭顱的量度來區別，頭部的長度（從前額量到後腦）與頭部的闊部之間的比率所造成的指數是區別種族的優劣的南針，首從賴修的學說發表以後，人類學家便將全體的人類分爲三種：「長頭」「闊頭」和「適中」。</p>
<p>許多隨聲附和的科學家立即將歐洲人分爲兩種：　「優秀的」長頭族—北歐和地中海沿岸各民族。　「低劣的」闊頭族或適中族—中歐各民族。而他們的產生被假設是從亞洲入侵的闊頭族所造成的混血兒。</p>
<p>到了現在，經過人類學家所量度的頭顧已是不計其數之多，魏頓里區博士覺得證據是充份了。他所得的事實是：　被認爲「玷汚」了歐洲的長頭族的亞洲人（顯赫的蒙古族）也是長頭的，而不是圓頭的。　在今天的世界上，唯一的佔優勢的長頭民族是澳洲和菲洲的野蠻民族。　各文明種族的全體人們，頭都在逐漸的變圓，這大槪是人類從四足伏行改取兩足豎立的姿勢的結果，因爲，這種姿勢改變了脊柱與頭顱底部的形式。</p>
<p>所以，長頭與圓頭孰優孰劣之爭是無謂的，全體的人類都在向「面圍圍」進化之中。</p>
<h3 id="c190">漫談大票 <a href="#c190" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e190" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">190</a></h3>
<p>— 如意</p>
<p>如果我們現在主張「發行票面一億元的大鈔」，恐怕會有許多人駡爲胡鬧罷？然而，事實上不但有價値我們國幣一億元的單張鈔票，而且還有每張價値超過十億元的鈔票！</p>
<p>說穿了其實很簡單，我所指的不過是票面一萬元的美鈔罷了。一萬美金，根據平衡基金會美匯基準價計算，豈不就是等於國幣十一億九千五百萬美元？</p>
<p>這種萬元美鈔在外面流通的當然極少，甚至有許多美國人民根本就不知道聯邦準備銀行印過這樣大票面的鈔票。這種鈔票大半都存儲在聯邦準備銀行的庫房裏，主要的用途是供美國國庫劃帳之用，但是儘管「劃」來「劃去，帳面不同，那些大鈔却往往仍舊在原處文風不動的。</p>
<p>但是，存儲這些大鈔的庫房在幾年前突然發生了一次大火，於是，有一小部份的萬元大鈔便流通到民間來了。當然，這樣大票面的鈔票在兌換小票時是相當困難的，因之這些大票的持有人竟肯自動貶値，祗要兌到七百五十元，已經心滿意足。</p>
<p>你也許要說，一萬元大鈔祗兌七百五十元，似乎太不合算吧？」不然。即使能兌到七十五元都還是便宜的，因爲在火災之後，政府已經把那些流通在外面的萬元鈔票宣布作廢了。</p>
<p>現在，美國有名的聯邦調査局邏騎密布，每逢萬元大鈔出現，持有人立刻就被傳訊，非交出所藏的全部萬元鈔不可。所以現在這種萬元鈔在外面已漸漸絕跡了。</p>
<p>你也許竟會說：「一萬美金算得了什麼！」那麽，還有現在美國政府不但擁有這許多萬元大鈔，而且竟連票面十萬元的鈔票也已經印好了！（你算算看：十萬美元，照官價該是國幣一百十九億五千萬元了。）這種鈔票也是專供美國政府使用的，但從未流到民間，因之現在流通在外面的美鈔，仍舊應以一萬元的佔首席。</p>
<p>此外，票面五千元的美鈔也可以看得到，但是發行得不多，流通在美國全國的祗有二千五百張。據聯邦準備銀行當局表示，發行票面五千元的鈔票，目的是爲了「便利民衆」。但一般美國人民却想不出這種大票能給他們多少「便利」，因爲實際上使用起來是非當「不」便利的。然而，無所不知的聯邦調査局却找到了一個答案，他們說，千元以上的大鈔實際上等於是指示黑市交易的信號。簡直可以說是「大鈔到處，無弊隨之」，旣可藏起來逃避所得稅，而且萬一東窗事發，必要時大鈔也便於「袖裏乾坤」。美國財政部根據了這個意見，已經通令全美國各銀行，凡是要求兌換大粟的顧客，必須留下姓名住址，以備查考。（譯自紐約先鋒論壇報）</p>

<h3 id="e1">Regulations on Remittances and Cash Transportation from Various Regions to Shanghai and Guangzhou: Stipulating a Limit of Two Hundred Million, Promulgated and Implemented by the Ministry of Finance <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 3rd] In order to cooperate with the strengthened implementation of financial control and credit tightening, and to prevent the excessive concentration of domestic funds in cities, while ensuring the circulation of funds for legitimate industrial and commercial businesses, the Ministry of Finance has specially formulated four management measures for remittances and cash transportation from various regions to Shanghai and Guangzhou. The contents are as follows:</p>
<p>For remittances from national banks, bureaus, and treasuries, provincial and municipal banks, and commercial banks and firms in various regions to Shanghai and Guangzhou, as well as remittances from national banks, bureaus, and treasuries, provincial and municipal banks, and commercial banks and firms in Shanghai and Guangzhou to other regions, those exceeding two hundred million should submit a detailed list of circumstances daily to the local Financial Management Bureau for verification. In areas without a Financial Management Bureau, submit to the local Central Bank for verification. When the Financial Management Bureau or Central Bank deems it necessary, it may notify the remitting bank to cease remittances for a specific remitter or to cease payment to a specific recipient in the future.</p>
<p>The amount of funds that national banks, bureaus, and treasuries, provincial and municipal banks, and commercial banks and firms in various regions request the Central Bank to transfer on their behalf each month should be directly negotiated with the local Central Bank.</p>
<p>For those transporting cash from inland areas to Shanghai and Guangzhou, each person shall not carry more than two hundred million yuan. Violators will have the excess portion deposited into a special account at the local Central Bank, and a three-month fixed deposit certificate will be issued, to be returned upon maturity. This regulation applies equally to silver and money businesses.</p>
<p>For those who, due to legitimate reasons, are unable to remit funds or transfer funds through banks and must personally carry cash to Shanghai and Guangzhou, they may apply to the local Financial Management Bureau for a cash transportation certificate, which they can carry as proof, and will not be subject to the above restrictions. In areas without a Financial Management Bureau, applications should be made to the local Central Bank. The Financial Management Bureaus or Central Banks in various regions should list the cash transportation certificates issued monthly and report them to the Ministry of Finance for verification. The above regulations have been promulgated and implemented by the Ministry and reported to the Executive Yuan for record.</p>
<h3 id="e2">Ministry of Economic Affairs Suggests to the Executive Yuan to Restore Industrial and Commercial Loans; Expanding the Purchase of Manufacturers' Finished Products to Eight Locations <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 3rd] The government, in order to tighten credit, had temporarily suspended various loans. The Ministry of Economic Affairs has recently received requests from various industrial and commercial groups to restore them and has suggested to the Executive Yuan:</p>
<p>Since the suspension of loans, various manufacturers have deeply felt the difficulty of capital turnover.</p>
<p>Industrial and commercial businesses generally feel a shortage of funds, and the need is especially urgent as the Lunar New Year approaches. Please restore loans before the Spring Festival.</p>
<p>In order to coordinate with production and maximize the effectiveness of loans, please adopt the method of order-based loans to purchase finished products in the future, and the industrial and commercial guidance offices of the Ministry of Economic Affairs should jointly conduct preliminary reviews with the Joint Treasury Board and its branches. Each point is presented for selection and implementation.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 3rd] The method of Shanghai National Banks and Bureaus purchasing finished products from manufacturers on behalf of the government was originally implemented only in Shanghai, Peiping, and Tianjin. It has now been decided to expand it to Qingdao, Hankou, Guangzhou, Chongqing, and Xi'an, and to implement it simultaneously. Furthermore, depending on the industrial situation in each region, purchase methods will be drafted in consultation with the various national banks and bureaus, and a review committee will be formed for evaluation, with applications starting immediately. Furthermore, the Joint Treasury Board will dispatch key personnel to various locations to supervise the handling.</p>
<h3 id="e3">Goods Without Permits Are Not Allowed to Be Shipped Without Authorization; Relevant Authorities Establish Implementation Measures <a href="#e3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 3rd] Regarding the implementation measures for the ban on importing goods without permits, it was resolved at the 25th meeting of the Executive Yuan: "From now on, goods without permits are not allowed to be imported. Violators will be treated as smugglers and all goods will be confiscated." The Customs Administration of the Ministry of Finance has specially drafted implementation measures for the new ban on goods without permits, which were passed at the 8th meeting of the Import and Export Control Committee and submitted to the Executive Yuan for record. A report was presented to the Executive Yuan on the 3rd. These measures are based on Article 9 of the Import and Export Trade Regulations: "Importers must not place orders abroad before obtaining an import permit, nor may they ship goods from abroad." Furthermore, the measures passed by the Executive Yuan as announced in Announcement No. 3 of the Import and Export Control Committee stipulate: "From now on, goods without permits are not allowed to be imported. Violators will be treated as smugglers and all goods will be confiscated." The regulations for customs enforcement of the above ban are as follows:</p>
<p>Regarding goods shipped from abroad after October 1, 1947: A. The import declaration for the above goods, along with the import permit, should be submitted to customs within 15 days after the arrival of the import vessel. B. If the import declaration and import permit cannot be submitted to customs within the above-mentioned deadline, the goods will be treated as smuggled goods and should be confiscated. A disposition notice should be issued by customs and sent to the manager of the import vessel for forwarding to the consignee or importer. If the manager of the import vessel or the consignee or importer has sufficient reason to disagree with the customs disposition and has obtained written certification from the competent department of the Import and Export Control Committee that consideration should be given due to the need to supply domestic demand and allocate quotas, a written objection should be made within 15 days after customs issues the notice. If there is no objection after the deadline, the goods will be confiscated by customs. C. Goods without permits may not be applied for storage in bonded warehouses. D. For goods that are indeed unloaded by mistake from import vessels or goods declared on the manifest for transshipment, re-export will be permitted. E. For goods confiscated by customs according to the procedures in item B, the unpaid warehouse rent, vessel demurrage fees, transportation fees, and all other expenses, as well as the bank's lien, shall be resolved by the relevant parties themselves.

<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 3rd] When the Executive Yuan previously passed the measures to adjust the salaries of public education personnel, it was stipulated that all agencies should reduce their staff by a quarter within six months, and the living allowance should be reduced by 5% each month, for a total reduction of 25%. This matter has aroused objections from various parties. The Control Yuan, Legislative Yuan, and Political Consultative Conference have all expressed their opinions.

As for the expenses for expanding the self-defense forces in each province, they could only collect special self-defense donations from companies and firms in each region, and it was decided to reject the original proposal.</p>

<h3 id="e10">Amendment to Article 8 of the Emergency Punishment Regulations for Endangering the Country Passed by the Political Affairs Council and Sent to the Legislative Yuan for Review <a href="#e10" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c10" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">10</a></h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 3rd] Regarding the amendment to Article 8, Paragraph 2 of the Emergency Punishment Regulations for Endangering the Country during the Suppression Period, the Executive Yuan has passed it at the 41st meeting this morning and sent it to the Legislative Yuan for review. Article 8, Paragraph 2 of the Regulations stipulates, "The organization of the special criminal court in the preceding paragraph shall be determined by the Executive Yuan in consultation with the Judicial Yuan." The Executive Yuan previously passed the "Regulations on the Organization of Special Criminal Courts" at the 38th meeting and sent it to the Judicial Yuan for consultation with the Legislative Yuan for review. Subsequently, the Judicial Yuan replied directly, expressing its strong agreement with the original draft and believing that since it must be sent directly to the Legislative Yuan to complete the legislative process, Article 8, Paragraph 2 of the "Emergency Punishment Regulations for Endangering the Country during the Suppression Period" should be amended to "The organization of the special criminal court in the preceding paragraph shall be determined by separate regulations," and requested the Legislative Yuan to review it together. At today's routine meeting of the Executive Yuan, it was decided to proceed according to the opinion of the Judicial Yuan and send it to the Legislative Yuan for review.</p>
<h3 id="e11">Adjustment of Highway Transportation Prices Approved by the Executive Yuan to Take Effect from January <a href="#e11" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c11" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">11</a></h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 3rd] The Executive Yuan approved the adjustment of highway passenger and freight transportation prices at the routine meeting on the 3rd. The case was submitted by the Ministry of Communications based on the Highway Administration's report in December of last year: Due to the impact of foreign exchange on the price of automobile materials, which is increasing daily, and the adjustment of employee salaries starting in October, the cost expenditure has increased by more than double compared to September. Although subsidies of 24 billion yuan per month have been approved starting in October, they are far from meeting the actual needs. It is estimated that the cost in January 1948, if calculated based on the current transportation prices, would result in even greater monthly losses, which the national treasury cannot bear. Therefore, the Transportation Office was authorized to appropriately adjust the current transportation prices starting in January 1948, estimated as follows: Passenger transport: The average ticket price per person-kilometer is increased from 800 yuan to 1,400 yuan. Freight transport: The average price per ton-kilometer is increased from 7,000 yuan to 12,000 yuan. Car rental is increased from 5,200 yuan to 9,000 yuan. After adjusting the above transportation prices, there would still be a monthly loss of 44 billion yuan, and additional subsidies are requested. The Ministry of Communications then forwarded the report to the Executive Yuan, which believed that the recent price fluctuations, foreign exchange adjustments, and increased highway transportation costs were indeed facts. The request to adjust highway passenger and freight transportation prices starting in January seemed approvable, but the losses after the adjustment were still significant. It was proposed to order a rapid report on the business and revenue status of various roads in the previous year for review. Furthermore, the State-owned highway, railway, and postal and telecommunications enterprises, which had originally been resolved by the State Council in the summer of last year to "gradually abolish subsidies to achieve self-sufficiency," have, since implementation, required frequent price adjustments due to the impact of military affairs and prices, and subsidies have also increased significantly. In the future, detailed reasons should be presented and approved by the Executive Yuan before implementation.</p>

<p>[United Press, Nanjing, 3rd] The suggestion by US Republican Senator Sands Shilong to issue new currency is not a concern for Chinese officials, but ordinary Chinese people who store US dollars all see it as bad news. Economic experts here are unwilling to speculate on the number of US dollars in China, but most acknowledge that the total amount is in the tens of millions. If the United States issues new banknotes, those who hold US dollars will have no choice but to exchange them for national currency at the official rate from the central bank or risk smuggling them to the United States to exchange them. According to foreign exchange control regulations, holding US dollars and other foreign currencies is not a crime, but buying, selling, or using foreign currencies is illegal.</p>

<h3 id="e28">Stability First! Rule of Law Paramount! <a href="#e28" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c28" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">28</a></h3>
<p>The nation is now entering a critical stage of suppressing bandits and quelling unrest. At the same time, the nation is also beginning to move towards the path of democratic constitutionalism. At this stage, our most pressing need is stability, and also the rule of law!</p>
<p>The Communist bandits create disturbances, hoping to overthrow the social order through these disturbances. The demands of the general law-abiding people are obviously the opposite. What they need is not disturbance, but stability. The Communist bandits destroy the rule of law, hoping to undermine the government's credibility through destroying laws and disrupting order, thereby using violence to seize power. The general law-abiding people, however, only hope for a peaceful and prosperous life within the bounds of the law, so they must know to respect the rule of law.</p>
<p>Currently, regardless of the overall national situation or local conditions, the general law-abiding people already feel that they cannot coexist with the Communist bandits. With the Communist bandits causing trouble, if they are not eliminated and suppressed, the general law-abiding people will have no room to survive! Therefore, today, when we judge the right and wrong of a matter from the standpoint of the general law-abiding people, the standard is very simple: those who maintain social stability are good, otherwise they are evil; those who respect the national rule of law are righteous, otherwise they are crooked!</p>
<p>Taking Shanghai as an example, three unfortunate incidents have occurred continuously in the past five or six days: on the 29th of last month, the Tongji University student unrest occurred, and the mayor was beaten and humiliated; on the 31st, the dance industry petitioned, and the Social Affairs Bureau was suddenly destroyed; on the 2nd of this month, the Shenxin No. 9 Factory workers went on strike, forcibly occupied the factory, and dismantled machinery, using violence to resist the military police who arrived to suppress them. Judging from these clamorous and disruptive events, regardless of their background or whether they are related to each other, Shanghai, as an international metropolis, inevitably suffers the stigma of "turmoil." Precisely because of the disturbances, people feel that society is becoming increasingly unstable; also precisely because of the disturbances, people are even more uncertain whether the nation still has the rule of law.</p>
<p>What we want to point out here first is that democracy is definitely not "rule by mobs," and constitutionalism is definitely not "lawless governance"! All violent acts, regardless of their original motives, regardless of the object of their violence, and regardless of how pleasant the excuses they borrow, are absolutely not allowed in a modern democratic country. This is because the first meaning of democratic constitutionalism is to give everyone the equal right to freely and reasonably express their opinions within the legal framework, and the violence that is imposed must deprive some people of these legitimate rights and infringe upon them. Under mob rule, there is no freedom; under mob rule, there is no equality. If freedom and equality are lost, where can we hope for a peaceful and prosperous life? The reason why the nation wants to suppress bandits and quell unrest is to "rescue the people from fire and water," and what is meant by fire and water is the "upside-down" life of losing freedom and equality. Shanghai is, after all, only a place that the Communist bandits are conspiring to disrupt, not a bandit-occupied area ravaged by the Communist bandits. The general law-abiding people certainly have the right to demand that the government authorities guarantee stability and implement the rule of law. Only stability and only the rule of law can prevent Shanghai from slipping into the edge of mob rule.</p>
<p>From this standpoint, we believe that the general law-abiding citizens all support the solemn attitude announced by Commander Xuan and Mayor Wu at the press conference the night before last. The Tongji student unrest, the dance industry unrest, and the Shenxin No. 9 Factory worker unrest, regardless of whether there are Communist bandit lurking elements instigating them, the fact that they have evolved into riots is something that the general law-abiding people cannot tolerate. Just listen to the voices of condemnation from leaders and key figures from all walks of life in recent days, and you can know where the true public opinion lies.</p>
<p>Tongji students, wanting to argue with the government or school authorities over the organizational issue of the student union, even if they have reasons, they can only state their case rationally under peace and order. Once they riot, regardless of whether the violent act is directed at the mayor, even if it is directed at teachers or another ordinary citizen, it is illegal and should be sanctioned by law. Whether their original motive for petitioning is pure is secondary. Similarly, dance industry workers and dancers, in order to request a relaxation of the ban on dancing or a change in the ban on dancing policy, could also, according to the law, state their reasons and make a request to the government in a dignified manner. Even if the Social Affairs Bureau, which is implementing the central government's orders, has already drawn lots, it has not yet reached the point of actually closing down. There is still room to file an administrative appeal or appeal to public opinion. Unfortunately, the people who lead these groups, regardless of labor or management, do not have this kind of training in rational living. They are driven by a few unruly elements, indulging in momentary recklessness, staging this ugly drama of mobs destroying administrative organs. Thus, something that might have gained public sympathy, something that might still have had a way to turn around and salvage, has become a loss of social sympathy. As for the workers of Shenxin No. 9 Factory, their usual treatment was already not bad, and workers in other industries may have felt that they could not reach it. Yet, as the Lunar New Year approached, they suddenly closed the factory gates, coerced a strike, and even used violence to resist the military police. It is certain that they were coerced by a few mobs. Even if the majority of law-abiding workers still had reason, there was no way to escape at that time. We believe that if they reflect on it afterwards, the majority of Tongji students, the majority of dancers, and dance industry workers, and the majority of Shenxin No. 9 Factory workers, will certainly regret it. Regret is the root of repentance, the beginning of moving towards goodness. We would like to remind them: these bad consequences are all caused by a few mobs destroying stability and destroying the rule of law. Therefore, regret alone is not enough. They must wake up and, from now on, not only no longer be incited by those few mobs and become their sacrifices, but also stand together on the side of the law-abiding people and work hard together to maintain stability and respect the rule of law.</p>
<p>Finally, we would also like to offer a few unwelcome words to the government authorities. Mencius said: "Good intentions alone are not enough for governing; laws alone cannot be implemented by themselves." The people currently want stability, and the government must give them stability in order to be good governance. The people currently want the rule of law, and the government must first respect the rule of law in order to hope to implement the law. The current overall situation, the key lies in suppressing bandits and quelling unrest. Great things that help suppress bandits and quell unrest should be done with utmost effort. Other things should be put on hold. Do not be moved by fashionable terms, thinking that this is good governance and that is also good governance, and then try to do everything at once. The result will only be that the laws and regulations are as numerous as the hairs of an ox, and nothing can be done smoothly. Even the officials themselves do not understand how many existing laws there are for managing these matters. The world could have been fine, why must you "make trouble" and "create" some accidents yourself? People could have been living peacefully and happily there temporarily, why must you make them lose their jobs and break their rice bowls at this time? The winter before last, the government vigorously cracked down on street vendors and rickshaws. Fortunately, the central authorities considered the people's livelihood and temporarily leniently handled the matter during this extraordinary period, saying that anything that would affect the livelihood of the common people should be handled slowly. As a result, society reduced some of the factors of unrest. We believe that this is what a statesman who understands the overall situation does. We want to call on the government: the Communist bandits and their blind followers are searching in all directions for topics to create unrest. While the government authorities must strictly guard against them, on the other hand, we must ask everyone across the country to pay attention to all measures and facilities: stability first, rule of law paramount, and also to think deeply and carefully, and not to send them a few more topics.</p>

<h3 id="e34">Tan Yunshan Discusses Feelings After Gandhi's Assassination: Physical Body May Perish, But Spirit Will Live Forever <a href="#e34" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c34" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">34</a></h3>
<p>[Central News Agency Changsha Dispatch, 3rd] After Indian Mahatma Gandhi was assassinated, the world was shocked. This reporter especially visited Tan Yunshan, Dean of the Chinese Academy of India International University and China's cultural representative to India, who is currently on leave and residing here, to inquire about his feelings after Mr. Gandhi's death. He said: Mr. Gandhi's death was for the unity of India, for world peace, for the righteousness of mankind, and for the truth of the universe. It was a victorious death, a successful death, a glorious death, and there is no regret in death. What we mourn is the tragic change in the hearts of the world, and that Mr. Gandhi's great compassion, great benevolence, great courage, universal love, sacrifice, and spirit of saving people and saving the world are not only respected and worshipped by the 400 million people of India, but also loved and admired by people all over the world. Yet, he was not understood by one or two violent thugs who dared to commit the heinous crime of all ages and cause his death. Is this not a tragic change in the hearts of the world? I previously discussed with friends in Nanjing the plan to respectfully invite Mr. Gandhi to visit China. Who knew that this wish would not be fulfilled and Mr. Gandhi would die, and even be assassinated? How can its sadness and pain be expressed to the extreme! Mr. Gandhi's great deeds in his life are known to the world. The most commendable thing is that his words, actions, and will are absolutely consistent. For example, Mr. Gandhi engaged in the movement to liberate the untouchables and regarded himself as an untouchable. He wore the same clothes, ate the same food, lived in the same place, traveled in the same ranks, and rode in the same class of cars. Anyone who saw Mr. Gandhi was moved, even if they were stubborn stones and rotten wood. Today, the world is anxious and depends on Mr. Gandhi's leadership and influence. There is no limit to it. Alas, Mr. Gandhi died like this. However, Mr. Gandhi's physical body is dead, but his spirit will live forever. Among Mr. Gandhi's followers, there is no shortage of talented people who can carry on his legacy. We sincerely hope that India, the entire nation, will inherit Mr. Gandhi's teachings and work harder for the unity of India, world peace, the righteousness of mankind, and the truth of the universe.</p>

<p>[Central News Agency Qingdao Dispatch, 3rd] Weihaiwei City, facing the sea and possessing a majestic atmosphere, has been recovered by the National Army for four months. Mayor Long of the city and his staff are working hard to restore local order, appease refugees, and organize baojia. The masses are returning one after another. However, in the southern part of the city, Communist bandits are still stubbornly resisting, taking advantage of the heavy wind and snow by the sea to harass the north with hundreds of people. The military port, wharf, lighthouse, and water and electricity facilities that have been operated for many years have been destroyed by the Communist bandits, and most of the buildings have also collapsed. Currently, the number of men, women, old, and young refugees in the urban and rural areas has reached 50,000. Because land-based food sources are blocked and maritime transportation is not smooth, food is extremely scarce. Local residents not only hope that the National Army will quell the banditry and stabilize the area, but also request that maritime transportation be expedited and food be provided as soon as possible.</p>

<h3 id="e69">Fourth Deputy Foreign Ministers' Meeting to Be Held on the 20th of This Month, Discussion of Austrian Peace Treaty, U.S. Secretary of State Formally Proposes <a href="#e69" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c69" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">69</a></h3>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 2nd] The State Department revealed that Secretary of State Marshall has proposed that a meeting of representatives of the four foreign ministers be held in London on February 20 to discuss the Austrian Peace Treaty and the recent new proposals made by the Soviet Union. The Soviet Union's revised proposal was delivered to Washington on January 26. In addition, the representatives of the four foreign ministers will also discuss France's proposed recommendations on the disposal of German property in Austria, as well as other issues related to the Austrian Peace Treaty. The State Department also announced that it will send Robert, Deputy Director of the European Department of the State Department, as the U.S. representative to the meeting of the representatives of the four foreign ministers, to succeed Tukey, the U.S. member who recently resigned from his position in the Austrian Allied Management Committee.</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 2nd] At the meeting of the four foreign ministers in December last year, it was agreed that the deputy foreign ministers should meet within five days after receiving the new proposals from the Soviet Union, and no later than February 1. Marshall said that although the Soviet Union's proposal was received on January 26, more time was needed to consider this complex plan, so he proposed postponing the meeting. Marshall, as the chairman of the next foreign ministers' meeting, has the power to reopen the meeting. If the four deputy foreign ministers can reach an agreement, the four foreign ministers will also meet to approve it and draft a formal proposal. However, the issue of German assets in Austria is extremely complicated, and a quick solution may not be possible. The Soviet Union's recent proposal includes the Soviet Union's request to lease several oil fields for a period of fifty years.</p>
<h3 id="e70">Accusing the U.S. of Assisting in Reorganizing the Iranian Military, the U.S. Rejects the Soviet Union's Protest, Denies Attempting to Turn Iran into a Strategic Base <a href="#e70" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c70" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">70</a></h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 2nd] A State Department spokesperson stated that the Soviet Union's accusation that the United States is pursuing militarism in Iran is either a deliberate distortion or a pure lie. The Soviet Union accused the United States of attempting to turn Iran into a strategic military base, which the Soviet Union considers to be interference in the internal affairs of its southern neighbor. In addition, the State Department has two other measures to counter the Soviet Union's series of diplomatic and propaganda offensives:  Preparing to submit a note rejecting the Soviet Union's protest on the 21st of last month regarding the reopening of the wartime U.S. air base in Manrah, North Africa, which violates the Italian Peace Treaty.  Waiting for the delivery of another Soviet Union protest regarding U.S. aircraft reconnaissance of Soviet ships near Japan.</p>
<p>Regarding the Soviet Union's accusations against the United States' actions in Iran, State Department Information Director McKetmore refuted each item as "fabrications" or "distortions" without waiting for a detailed report. According to McKetmore, there are two military delegations from major countries stationed in Iran, one is a military advisory group, and the other is an advisory group to reorganize the gendarmerie. According to the published agreement, their tasks are limited to training and consultation, and the total number of people is only fifty. In addition, the United States has agreed to provide a credit loan of $25 million, allowing Iran to purchase U.S. military surplus, but the Iranian government is now proposing to only use $10 million of it. Moscow criticized that the United States is reorganizing the Iranian army in the American way and reforming the industry to manufacture American-style weapons, etc., McKetmore said that these are not true. McKetmore also denied the Soviet Union's claim that the United States is building a huge airport for aircraft outside of Iran to use, saying that the U.S. government is not building an airport anywhere in Iran. As for the claim that the United States is helping Iran consolidate its border defenses and is using aircraft to map the border, McKetmore denounced it as pure fabrication.</p>

<p>[United Press, Tehran, 3rd] After the Soviet Union issued a protest accusing the U.S. delegation of engaging in military preparations hostile to the Soviet Union in Iran, the situation suddenly became tense. The Iranian Supreme National Defense Council convened a special meeting on the 3rd. Iranian Prime Minister Hakimi said that Iran's reply to the Soviet protest is being drafted and can be completed on the 4th. Iranian Chief of Staff Lazimala said that he is constantly maintaining contact with the military defenses guarding northern Iran via radio, as rumors are rife in Tehran that the Soviet Union is about to conduct military operations in the area. The Soviet Union's note accused the U.S. military advisory group of directing Iran's military preparations. The acting head of the group, Marr, denounced the Soviet Union's accusations on the 3rd as completely fabricated. "The Soviet Union claims that a huge airport is being built in Kong Ying, but in fact there is no construction happening. The Soviet Union also claims that the U.S. military has occupied the U.S. wartime military camp near Tehran, but there are no military buildings there either, which proves that the Soviet Union's words are not true. The above-mentioned military camp is now inhabited by university students. Furthermore, U.S. military personnel have not approached the Soviet border to engage in reconnaissance or measurement flights."</p>

<p>[Reuters, Tokyo, 3rd] Japanese sources reveal that the Allied Command has agreed to hand over 28 destroyers and submarines from the former Imperial Japanese Navy to the Japanese police to patrol the Japanese Inland Sea, territorial waters, and the Sea of Japan, and the East Sea. These submarine chasers are currently used to prevent smuggling activities at sea. According to a spokesperson for the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs, they had previously expressed hope that the peace treaty with Japan would include the following provisions: allowing the Japanese police to possess machine guns and armored vehicles to maintain internal security; an adequate coast guard to deal with piracy and smuggling; a small air force to support the police and coast guard.</p>
<p>Allied Command officials stated that submarine chasers have been performing anti-smuggling tasks for several months. Unofficial sources even stated that the Allied Command is considering equipping these warships with heavier weapons. According to officials from the Japanese Ministry of Transport, most of the submarine chasers currently in service are old and dilapidated, with half of them requiring constant repairs. Their maximum speed is only 9 knots per hour, and they are not armed, with only the handguns carried by the police officers. Therefore, they are often unable to chase smugglers. The main force of the submarine chasers is stationed around Kyushu Island to prevent illegal intrusions, while the rest are stationed near Hokkaido, where they can assist ships in distress due to the large waves. Since the submarine chasers began operations, they have captured nine ships illegally entering the country, fifteen ships violating economic regulations, and rescued eighteen ships in distress.</p>

<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 2nd] US Treasury Secretary Snyder recently stated that measures to assist the Marshall Plan in gaining control over $1.1 billion in frozen deposits of people from various countries in the United States have been completed. The US National Advisory Council has approved this measure. Secretary Snyder disclosed the order while listening to the Marshall Plan at the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. The US National Advisory Council has repeatedly stated that no action will be taken regarding the $4.3 billion in free assets owned by private citizens of the sixteen European countries. Regarding this point, Snyder also stated that it is impossible to investigate the exact amount of private deposits or assets of foreign people in the United States, and the US government cannot control them. This control requires all parties to continue reporting their assets. Our country's deposits in the United States were completely frozen a year ago, but these frozen deposits of our country are not affected by the above measures. The United States has now set a deadline of three months, ordering direct or indirect owners of foreign assets to request their home governments to provide proof, confirming that their bank deposits or other investments are indeed their personal property and unrelated to enemy assets. If sufficient proof is not obtained for the frozen assets within the deadline, the deposit accounts will be canceled, and the funds will be placed under the US government. Subsequently, the United States will conduct a thorough investigation of the declared assets and notify the respective foreign governments. Assets for which proof is not obtained will be transferred to countries receiving aid under the Recovery Plan for future measures.</p>

<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 3rd, United Press] The Soviet government today notified the US State Department, expressing its desire to return seven oil tankers and one cargo ship obtained from the United States during the war under the Lend-Lease Act. State Department officials stated that the Soviet suggestion to return these eight ships to the United States is only a partial settlement of the Soviet Union's total Lend-Lease debt. The United States supplied approximately 95 ships to the Soviet Union during the war under the Lend-Lease Act. The US State Department requested the Soviet Union to return these ships in March 1946, or to pay for them at their assessed value.</p>

<p>[Reuters, Han, 3rd] Three million workers in the British and American zones went on a 24-hour strike today to protest the lack of food rations. Factories, stores, restaurants, and entertainment venues throughout the area were brought to a standstill. While 750,000 people in the American zone of Baden province were on strike, US military commander General Clay happened to be in Stuttgart in that province to address the monthly meeting of the American zone's state committees. The chairman of the province's trade union, Kleinauschnit, stated that the strike coinciding with Clay's presence in Stuttgart was purely coincidental. Upon arriving in Stuttgart, Clay issued a declaration stating that while he opposed the strike, he would not allow the situation to get out of control. British military commander Robertson convened an emergency meeting of the premiers of the British zone in Hamburg, and afterwards issued a declaration urging workers to maintain essential public utilities. Hamburg trams continued to operate as usual, and the trade union indicated that it did not intend to participate in the strike. Gas supplies in the British and American zones also continued as usual, but electricity supplies in some cities were reduced compared to normal. German Social Democratic leader Schumacher also appealed to the workers, pointing out that the strike would further hinder Germany's ability to obtain more food through self-help. Striking workers were also scheduled to hold major parades in major cities in the British and American zones this afternoon. Although military and police were on alert, officials did not anticipate any accidents.</p>

<p>[Reuters, London, 3rd] It is understood that the British government has protested to the Romanian government regarding the Romanian government's sentencing of Maniu, the leader of the Romanian Peasant Party, and other leaders of the party to imprisonment. It pointed out that these actions violate the human rights provisions in the new treaty with Romania. The US government has also sent a similar note to Romania. Previously, Britain and the United States protested during the trial of Peasant Party leader Petkov in Bulgaria. As a result, the Bulgarian government claimed that the protests from Britain and the United States made it impossible to avoid Petkov's death sentence. Therefore, during the trial period of Maniu, the British government did not send a protest to avoid it being used as an excuse.</p>

<p>[United Press, New Delhi, 2nd] The city was peaceful today, but Calcutta and Mumbai remain chaotic.

<p>[United Press, New Delhi, 2nd] Nehru has now made the survival of his cabinet contingent on whether he can suppress the illegal activities of the Hindu extremists responsible for Gandhi's assassination. Nehru challenged the extremists twice, once at a session of the National Assembly and again at a large public meeting, demanding a showdown. He told the parliament, "We are determined to deal with all those in our country who advocate religious hatred." He challenged the extremists, "Do they have the courage to stand up and face the public?" While special teams are searching the headquarters of various extremist groups in major cities in India, investigating suspects in the assassination of Nehru and other leaders, the government is taking special steps to ban various religious groups from maintaining private armies, prohibiting the use of force by Hindus. According to the announcement of this ban, "Gandhi's death is a remnant of the forces of hatred and violence still active in our country. This act damages the freedom of the country and stains the good name of the country." These forces must be quickly controlled and eradicated.

<p>Isolationists Constantly Make Trouble for Themselves</p>
<p>The path to the establishment of the US neutrality laws was paved by listening to the advice of the Nye Committee. This committee was established by the Senate to investigate the manufacture and sale of munitions. I doubt that any congressional committee has had a more unfortunate impact on our country's foreign relations than this committee, except perhaps the Senate Foreign Relations Committee that previously considered President Wilson's Treaty of Versailles, or one that could be compared to it.</p>
<p>North Dakota Republican Senator Gerald P. Nye proposed a resolution in February 1934, calling for the establishment of a committee to conduct investigations, after publishing several papers advocating the disclosure of details of US manufacturers selling munitions to foreign governments.</p>
<p>After the Senate approved this resolution, minority Republican Senator Nye was appointed chairman of the investigative committee by Vice President Garner. Nye was a figure with a strong isolationist color, and the passage of the resolution was simply a casual result, without careful consideration. This was a major mistake, which Senator Pittman should be responsible for. Pittman himself was an isolationist in many ways. As a rule, when a special committee is established for a certain purpose, it should be chaired by a member of the majority party—which was the Democratic Party at the time—and not by a member of the minority party, especially in an investigative committee. Although Pittman was the chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, he was busy with other work and decided to let Nye take over. If Pittman had recommended another chairman, the vice president would have accepted it.</p>
<p>If I could have dreamed that an isolationist Republican would be appointed chairman, I would have quickly opposed it, but I always assumed that a member of the majority party would be nominated according to usual practice, and that he would limit the investigation to legal and reasonable boundaries, so as not to turn it into a large-scale propaganda campaign.</p>
<p>Appointing Nye was a fatal blow, because under his chairmanship, the committee began to expand the scope of the investigation, attempting to prove that the United States' involvement in World War I was caused by American bankers and arms manufacturers. It ignored or refuted the significant reasons for our participation in this war, namely the illegal sinking of American ships and the destruction of American lives by German submarines, as well as the danger to the United States and its founding principles if Germany were to win. We had to advocate the principle of self-defense.</p>
<p>Our generation holds an international perspective, which is that if world peace is to be maintained, the United States must participate in this effort; we have argued for this point based on reason. Therefore, most of the members of this committee were, in fact, undermining the basis of our argument. Their view was that if the sale of munitions and loans to belligerent countries could be stopped, the United States could automatically avoid war, without needing to cooperate with other countries to achieve this goal. The growing dangers in Europe and Asia were merely a pressing reason for them to retreat within our country's borders, because they were opposed to giving any assistance to other countries to solve these dangers.</p>
<p>This committee insulted President Wilson's motives and sincerity in World War I, ridiculed our former allies Britain and France, and exonerated the German Empire, thus giving the American people a completely false view of why we participated in the 1917 war. The committee undoubtedly made useful disclosures regarding the arms trade, but the impact was to push our country into the deepest isolationism, precisely at a time when it was urgently necessary to use our influence to help avoid the increasingly imminent threat of war abroad.</p>
<p>The committee discovered that the country was enthusiastic about opposing big bankers and arms manufacturers. It attracted a lot of public attention, so its desire for fame was further heightened, hoping to gain more attention. Its chief investigator, Stephen Raushenbush, was largely the main body of the committee, generally guiding its activities. He was eager for the committee to make headlines, paying little attention to the impact of his news on other governments—not to mention our own people—and the news itself was often nothing more than rumors and half-truths.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the committee's senators simply allowed their chief investigator to do whatever he wanted, as often happens in this situation. The members of the committee were very organized, and there were quite a few capable people, several of whom had always taken attacking big bankers and arms manufacturers as a pastime. These people should bear most of the responsibility for the actual work of the committee and the fierce attacks on bankers and arms manufacturers. Their publicity director constantly fed so-called news to newspapers in this country and other countries.</p>
<p>On the government side, it was clear that no one could resist the vortex of isolationism. Just mentioning an investigation would elicit widespread welcome. The President and I, of course, agreed to cooperate with the committee, especially since its original purpose, namely investigating the arms trade, was worthy of praise.</p>
<p>After the committee spent the entire summer of 1934 reviewing documents and collecting evidence, it began to present its opinions on September 4. Our difficulties with other countries began almost immediately. The Buenos Aires government protested against certain rumors related to an Argentine admiral in the committee. British Acting Foreign Secretary Vansittart protested against slanderous allegations concerning King George V. The Mexican government protested against points involving President Rodriguez. Other Latin American governments objected to accusations implicating their senior officials in bribery. The Chinese government submitted a memorandum denying that a $10 million wheat loan obtained from us had been used to purchase munitions.</p>
<p>As a result, I personally went to see the Nye Committee on September 11 and spoke with them for two hours. I pointed out that our country's diplomatic relations were being harmed by the publication of rumors involving the heads or senior officials of other governments. Therefore, Senator Nye drafted a letter to me, acknowledging that some statements in the committee's records might create a false impression, which he deeply regretted. I myself also issued a statement clarifying that neither the committee nor any official of our government had any intention of offending any other government or its officials. I sent Nye's letter and my own statement to the ambassadors of the countries that had protested.</p>
<p>However, the situation worsened when the Nye Committee began to publicly involve documents from the State Department, the publication of which had not been approved at all. According to diplomatic etiquette accepted worldwide, after a government receives a document from another government, it is usually not made public until the other government officially approves its publication. So, for the sake of the Nye Committee, we began to enter into strained relations with many other governments. I found it extremely difficult to contain the exceptionally harmful news of this negligence. I spent a lot of time explaining or apologizing to other governments, because they were deeply displeased.</p>
<p>But when the Nye Committee began to study the background of World War I and began to investigate the records of New York banks that had dealings with the Allied Powers, our difficulties became even more acute. The British and Chinese ambassadors repeatedly protested.</p>
<p>I had been trying to get the President to support my efforts to limit the activities of the Nye Committee to reasonable boundaries. On March 15, I gave him a memorandum urging him to convene the Nye Committee to the White House for a meeting, advising them to "avoid any unnecessary provocations when publicly expressing opinions on issues that could hinder the relations between our government and other governments." The President did meet with the members of the Nye Committee four days later, but for some reason, he did not raise my request.</p>
<p>One point that I hoped the members of the Nye Committee would understand was that Hitler had already overturned the military clauses of the Treaty of Versailles, and Mussolini was completing his plan to invade Abyssinia. The scene of Britain, France, and the United States fiercely arguing about documents from twenty years ago could not stop Hitler and Mussolini's plans. At this time, Britain and France were trying to get Germany to accept an arms limitation agreement and persuade Mussolini to abandon his aggression in Africa. The anti-British and anti-French wave caused by the Nye Committee could not help Britain and France's efforts.</p>
<p>However, the worst example of the Nye Committee's negligence was still to come. On January 15, 1936, in a public statement, the committee mentioned the contents of a confidential memorandum submitted by British Foreign Secretary Balfour to Secretary of State Lansing on May 18, 1917, which involved the secret agreements of Britain and other Allied governments. Nye claimed that it was a lie when President Wilson and Secretary of State Lansing stated that they knew nothing about Britain's secret agreements before the Paris Peace Conference. We had previously consulted the British government, asking if they would allow the publication of this memorandum, which they refused, and we had notified Nye of this point on December 23, 1935. Therefore, this action was a serious breach of trust. I strongly protested to the Nye Committee, and as a result, it agreed to return the full copy of the Balfour memorandum to the State Department.</p>
<p>On January 20, I issued a statement to the press, elaborating the State Department's attitude towards the publication of confidential documents in the archives. I said that our government is clearly unable to publish confidential documents without the permission of the relevant government, because that government trusts us to keep secrets."</p>
<p>I said at a press conference: "I worked in the Wilson administration. Needless to say, I, like the American public, have the highest respect for his patriotism and honesty—as it was in the past, so it is now."</p>
<p>Nye's statement provided the springboard for the first neutrality law of our era for isolationists, and it is for this reason that I have detailed it at length.</p>
<p>The truth is that I did not want neutrality legislation. Of course, I did not want neutrality legislation promoted by isolationists like Nye, because it would tie the government's hands and feet, and it would tell potential aggressors like Germany, Italy, or Japan that they could declare war on their intended victims, and we would at that time ensure that our citizens did not supply munitions to the victims.</p>
<p>I did not want to see legislation that would tell the world in advance that if war broke out, we would not take action, because this would hinder our ability to use our influence to prevent war. Nor did I want to see legislation that stipulated that if war broke out, we could not give even the smallest amount of aid to the League of Nations, the world organization, to help it in its efforts to end the war.</p>

<h3 id="e91">The Mayor, Though Ill, Travels Tirelessly for Impoverished Students - Holding Meetings to Raise Scholarship Funds, Securing 12.4 Billion on the Spot - Speaker Pan Admonishes Students to Know How to Repay Society <a href="#e91" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c91" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">91</a></h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] The Shanghai Scholarship First Review Committee held a meeting yesterday afternoon at 4:00 PM on the 14th floor of the International Hotel. Despite being ill, Mayor Wu attended and presided over the meeting promptly. Those in attendance included Pan Gongqing, Shi Tiewu, Du Yuesheng, Wu Kaixian, Xu Jiyu, Wang Xiaolai, Liu Gongyun, Li Ximou, responsible figures from the press, leaders from various industries, and presidents of various schools, totaling over 200 people. First, the Mayor briefly mentioned the recent Tongji University student protests, the destruction of the Social Affairs Bureau by dancers, and the Longgong incident at the Shenxin Textile Mill. He then emphasized that with such social disorder, it was even more urgent to help young people who were out of school. He stated that the student protests arose from young people's dissatisfaction with reality, and the problem of impoverished students advancing in their education must be solved. Although he had been assaulted, he believed that young people were lovable and students were also lovable. The act of violence was committed by a few rioters, and he still cared deeply for all students. Rescuing those out of school was a responsibility they should fulfill, and he hoped that all sectors of society would donate enthusiastically.</p>
<p>Speaker Pan expressed his gratitude on behalf of everyone that Mayor Wu would travel tirelessly for impoverished students despite his illness, and he gave a brief report on the fundraising for scholarships. The fundraising goal for summer scholarships in the 36th year of the Republic [1947] was 5 billion, and the result was 5.996974 billion was raised. Of this, 4.561 billion was distributed, all of which was carefully reviewed by the Unified Review Committee before being directly distributed to the school authorities. Currently, various schools have high expenditures and have also increased tuition fees. The tuition fee for schools above the junior college level has been set at 4.5 million to 6 million. This number initially sounds very large, but when converted into the price of rice, it is only between three and four "dan" [a unit of dry volume], which is only about 30 yuan before the war. Moreover, the school authorities must take into account that the treatment of professors cannot be too meager, and their situation is indeed difficult, so they cannot be overly criticized. However, after the increase in tuition fees, the problem of being out of school has become more serious, so the target for this year's scholarships is set at 15 billion, which is twice that of last year. However, whether the target can be reached depends on the generous contributions of leaders from all walks of life. The committee has already issued notices asking all units that pledged donations last year to continue their donations. If the amount is insufficient, fundraising will be carried out in other industries.</p>
<p>After Speaker Pan finished speaking, the representatives from various sectors enthusiastically pledged donations on the spot. Yesterday alone, the total amount reached 12.425 billion. The list of pledges is as follows: This newspaper, 600 million; Xinwen Bao, 600 million; Dahua Bao, 100 million; Municipal Government, 5 billion; Stock Exchange, 1 billion; Municipal Bank, 1 billion; Yangtze Electric Company, 200 million; Central Bank, 200 million; Bank of China, 200 million; Bank of Communications, 200 million; Farmers Bank, 200 million; Central Trust Bureau, 200 million; Postal Savings and Remittance Bureau, 100 million; Central Cooperative Treasury, 100 million; Cloth Industry, 500 million; Gold and Silver Jewelry Industry, 500 million; Dyeing and Weaving Industry, 500 million; Shipping Industry, 500 million; Inland Water Transportation, 100 million; Flour Industry, 500 million; China Nanyang Brothers Tobacco Company, 75 million; a reader of Dagong Bao, 50 million.</p>
<p>Speaker Pan then expressed his personal thoughts, stating briefly: Raising scholarship funds is a government and society cooperating together, and automatically helping impoverished students. However, we must take this opportunity to admonish the students that we do not owe them anything. Since we owe no debt, we have no obligation to raise this money. Students should understand that with society putting in so much effort, they should know how to repay society. If young people still do not understand and are still being used by others to stir up trouble, complaining that 15 billion is not enough and attempting to greedily ask for more, then what reason do we have to continue to care for these young people? I received news yesterday that students from various schools gathered at St. John's University to hold a meeting, advocating that the Municipal Standing Bureau should allow each school to raise funds on its own. I believe that this is absolutely unacceptable. Social order must be maintained. Students will not be allowed to block traffic and rush around everywhere, thereby disrupting social order. Furthermore, sporadic fundraising by students will likely not amount to 500 million or 1 billion, which will not help the matter and may instead create opportunities for causing trouble. Therefore, I believe that while the government should care for the students, it must also admonish them with a strict attitude! If any school is found to have students going out to raise funds on their own in the future, their eligibility to apply for scholarships will be revoked.</p>
<p>Subsequently, Commander Xuan, Xu Jiyu, Wang Xiaolai, Wang Yunsheng, Zhu Jingnong, and others gave speeches separately.</p>
<p>Finally, the Mayor stood up and expressed his gratitude to the representatives from various sectors for their enthusiastic donations. He also reported that he had recently received intelligence that the Communist Party had recently published "Student Daily," in which they attacked the government's fundraising efforts for scholarships and declared that the government should guarantee that every young person has the opportunity to study. Such a claim is simply absurd. Today, I am publicly promoting "Student Daily," hoping that students will study it for themselves! Regarding the handling of the arrested students, he does not intend to be overly strict, but he will also not be lenient, and will handle it completely according to the law. Those who assaulted others will receive the punishment they deserve, and those who incited them will also receive the punishment they deserve.</p>
<h3 id="e92">Mayor Wu Recounts the Whole Story of Being Assaulted <a href="#e92" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c92" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">92</a></h3>
<p>Regarding the whole story of Mayor Wu being assaulted at Tongji University the other day, Mr. Wu gave a detailed account yesterday. He said: Before the conflict occurred, I repeatedly advised the students not to move forward in order to avoid contact with the police. Around 4:00 PM, everything was still calm and peaceful. Most of the students were talking to me with great enthusiasm and rapport. Later, chaos suddenly broke out. I believe that someone must have been directing them. At that time, stones and mud were flying directly at the police, causing the police to become very emotional. At that time, a large group of students rushed forward, and I was standing in the middle of them. I only had a policeman and an adjutant with me. Suddenly, five people rushed towards me, and someone next to me shouted, "Hit him!" I personally heard the chairman of the school's student union shout, "Don't hit the mayor!" But I was already hit on the left and right sides of my forehead. Seeing that the situation was critical at the time, I quickly ordered the police, "Do not fire!" Before I could finish speaking, someone grabbed my throat. Someone next to me shouted, "Your police are hitting people!" I said, "Let me up, and I'll tell the police not to fire!" But someone next to me shouted, "Don't let him up!"</p>
<p>Recalling the time, I felt extremely dangerous.</p>
<p>Looking back on it, I felt that the situation at the time was extremely dangerous. The conspirators had already made meticulous arrangements, using students as sacrifices and the government as a tool, attempting to create a bloody tragedy. At the time when I was being assaulted, if I had just shouted "Help!", I am certain that the police would have opened fire. In order to avoid bloodshed, I ordered the police not to fire, and my throat was strangled. After calming down and reflecting on the pain, I realized that the conspiracy was truly frightening. Thanks to God's blessing and the strict discipline of the police, their plan did not succeed. Now, after the incident, the conspirators are spreading rumors, claiming that the mayor was not injured by students but was trampled by police cavalry, which is extremely absurd. I hope that young students will not be used by them.</p>

After the members expressed their opinions, they agreed that in order to stabilize people's hearts, the handling of the Shenxin No. 9 Mill incident should still adopt a guiding approach. President Zhang also stated that some practical issues, such as year-end bonuses and welfare, should be resolved responsibly so that the lives of the workers can be stabilized.</p>
<h3 id="e98">Shenxin No. 9 Mill Returns to Calm - Doors are Closed, Remnants Still Remain - The Instigating Workers Have a Tight Organization, the Source of the Wooden-Case Gun Bullets is Worth Investigating <a href="#e98" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c98" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">98</a></h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] The Shenxin No. 9 Mill has returned to calm after the turmoil of the previous day. Yesterday evening, this reporter went to inspect the mill and saw that the gates were already closed, with only the side door left open for entry and exit. Three or four policemen were patrolling outside the door, while some idlers from the nearby neighborhood were still peeking and craning their necks at the entrance. A notice posted on the wall by Yan Fang stated: "This mill has unfortunately experienced a strike. Various equipment inside the mill has been severely damaged. We are now actively organizing and gradually resuming work. Once the organization is complete, the resumption of work in each department will be announced separately." There was also a notice from the mill's industrial union stating: "The labor unrest that occurred in this mill has resulted in bloodshed, which was entirely caused by a few insidious elements. Our good workers were unfortunately used by these villains because they were unaware of the inner workings, which is truly pitiful. Our union, standing on the side of the workers, will urge the factory to resume production as soon as possible in order to maintain their livelihoods. We will do our best to protect the workers who did not participate in the riots. We hope that our workers will calmly wait for the date of resumption of work and not trouble themselves unnecessarily." The remnants of the conflict inside and outside the third iron gate inside the factory have not yet been cleaned up, and broken tiles, gravel, iron bars, and other debris are still scattered all over the ground. According to the person in charge of the factory, because most of the staff have not rested for several days and nights, and the relevant authorities are still waiting to take pictures as evidence, the cleanup will not begin until today. The replacement and repair of damaged parts on various machines is still possible and should not affect production. However, in terms of timing, it is feared that it will be impossible to resume work within the lunar year and it will be delayed until the beginning of the lunar new year. Bad elements among the workers will be purged, and the rest will continue to be employed.</p>
<p>Workers not involved remain in dormitories</p>
<p>According to Chief Qi of the Putuo Road Police Precinct, the five firearms lost by the police officers in the chaos at the Shenxin Mill have not yet been recovered. However, two wooden-case gun casings were found in the mill. According to what he knows, the military police who went to the Shenxin No. 9 Mill to suppress the unrest that night did not have these kinds of firearms and bullets, so the source of these firearms and bullets is worth investigating.</p>
<p>The workers who have been found to have no involvement in the riots are currently residing peacefully in the factory dormitories. The sixty-eight workers who were suspected and arrested at the time have been detained in the headquarters, Lujiawan, and Songchu police precincts.</p>
<p>5,000 rice bowls also used as weapons</p>
<p>According to the post-incident investigation, the workers' riots were well-organized in advance. The command center was located in the office of the mill's engineering department, which issued orders and controlled the actions of all workers. Underneath it, there was also a transportation team that used yarn-carrying vehicles to transport yarn spindles and parts to the second and third floors as weapons to resist arrest. In addition, ten large oil drums were found on the roof of the three-story fine yarn workshop, containing large amounts of stones, bricks, iron rollers, and iron wheels. At that time, the rice bowls in the dining hall were also used as weapons, so all of the more than five thousand rice bowls were destroyed.</p>
<p>Some female workers miscarried due to being crowded</p>
<p>According to the person in charge of the factory's labor union, the incident was purely instigated by a small number of conspirators and was not negotiated through the labor union. Most pitiful of all were the majority of female workers who were forced to participate. They were confined in the factory building and were not allowed to go out. Some of these female workers had infants at home or elderly and weak family members who were crying from hunger and cold. Some pregnant female workers miscarried due to being crowded, which is truly unbearable to hear.</p>
<h3 id="e99">Police Chief Yu Announces the Aftermath of the Three Major Disturbances - Plans to Increase Security Police to Deal with Contingencies <a href="#e99" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c99" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">99</a></h3>
<p>The three major disturbances that have occurred in the city recently have all come to an end. Police Chief Yu announced the handling of the aftermath to reporters at 5:00 PM on the afternoon of the 3rd as follows:</p>
<p>Regarding the Tongji University student protests and the assault on Mayor Wu Guozhen on January 29th, a total of 97 suspects were arrested. After a detailed interrogation, it was determined that Shao Zhao and two others were highly suspicious and suspected of being Communist spies. It was decided to send them to the Garrison Headquarters for military legal proceedings. Another 39 were sent to the District Attorney's Office for questioning, and the rest have been gradually released on bail. The situation at Tongji University has improved, so the authorities have decided not to dissolve the university. The armored unit of the police stationed at the school has been withdrawn, and only a security police squad is stationed nearby.</p>
<p>Regarding the incident of dancers and dance hall employees destroying the Social Affairs Bureau on January 31st, 797 people were arrested at the time. After two days and nights of interrogation, 116 people were detained, and the rest were released on bail. Among the 116 people, more than 40 were seriously involved and will be dealt with severely. Those with particularly serious circumstances will be sent to the Garrison Headquarters for legal proceedings, and more than 40 others will be reprimanded and released on bail. The rest are still under consideration. Regarding the dance hall unrest, Section Chief Li Junhou of the Criminal Investigation Section stated that according to the interrogation results, it can be determined that the initiators of the incident were the employees (dance hall managers). As for the dancers who participated, there were no big names like "Ah Gui Jie" from Red Star or Da Dong. These people had shallow knowledge and experience and were easily agitated, just to make up the numbers. Therefore, the police's interrogation will be based on the criminal behavior to determine the severity of the punishment. Among the 40-plus people who will be dealt with severely, there is a person named Jin Ying who cut electrical wires and broke glass at the time, and another person named Tan Peiwu who shouted loudly, leading the crowd. The "three giants" of the dance industry, Sun Hongyuan, Tang Zongjie, and Hu Junyuan, are also included. In addition, there are also "Xiao Lang" and other elements who participated in the destruction of the Social Affairs Bureau. They are very young and are interested in destructive work, but are ignorant and should be held legally responsible. Regarding the handling of these people, Yuan Wenzhang, Director of the Fourth Section of the Social Affairs Bureau, suggested sending them to the vagrant work rehabilitation center, but a final decision has not yet been made.</p>
<p>Regarding the workers' riot at the Shenxin No. 9 Mill on February 2nd, a total of 199 people who were identified on the spot as the instigators were arrested, including 132 men and 67 women. Among them were Wu Shizhen, Fei Gaogen, Sun Hanchao, Zhang Fuda, Miao Xinggen, and others who played a leading role. The Criminal Investigation Section is currently conducting a detailed interrogation and will send them to the Garrison Headquarters Military Law Department or the District Attorney's Office for questioning, bail, or release depending on the severity of the circumstances. During the riot, 37 workers were injured and 3 died, including Wang Junmei (trampled to death), Zhu Minzhen, and Jiang Zhengxin (both shot to death). 51 police officers were injured, including 5 seriously injured. As for Zhang Yusheng, a Jiaotong University student who was arrested at the scene, Wu Kunsheng, the manager of Shenxin No. 9 Mill, proved that he was a teacher hired by the mill workers and has been taken back by the factory director.</p>
<p>Police Chief Yu also revealed that, in light of the recent disturbances, the police have drafted a plan to increase the security police by one more regiment, totaling one thousand people (currently there are two regiments), to deal with temporary emergencies.</p>
<h3 id="e100">The Trade Union Confederation Announcement - Strictly Prevents Villain Activity <a href="#e100" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c100" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">100</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Trade Union Confederation, on the 3rd, issued an announcement regarding the unfortunate incident at the Shenxin No. 9 Mill, the original text of which reads: "The unfortunate incident at the Shenxin No. 9 Mill this time was caused by insidious elements who infiltrated the workers, deliberately destroying production and disrupting social order. Most of our workers were blinded by them and caused a bloody incident, acting blindly and going on strike suddenly, not only making unreasonable demands but also refusing negotiations. When the matter became unresolvable, although most of the workers realized that they were being used by villains and coerced by evil forces, they persisted for many days, eventually clashing with the local military police, which is truly unfortunate for the labor community. The damage to the machinery in the factory was also an unwise move. We hope that all trade unions will take strict precautions from today onwards. If any villains infiltrate the trade union or factory to carry out activities, they should immediately report to this confederation or notify the security authorities to investigate."</p>

<p>In the Shenxin No. 9 Mill riot, police officers were ordered to suppress the unrest. The workers in the factory attacked the police with bricks, stones, and nitric acid, resulting in dozens of police officers being injured in the line of duty. Mayor Wu deeply commended the officers' service spirit and yesterday morning sent Police Chief Yu Shuping and Chief of General Affairs Ouyang Zunquan to the police hospital to visit them separately.</p>

<p>[Report from this newspaper] Wu Kunsheng, the manager of Shenxin No. 9 Mill, told reporters yesterday that whether the factory accepts the conditions proposed by the workers of the No. 9 Mill will affect the entire cotton textile industry and other industrial and commercial enterprises. The factory cannot accept them. As for the year-end bonus, it had already been distributed in 40 days, 50 days, and 60 days before the end of the lunar year, discounted at 80%, with a total of 23 billion yuan being distributed. The factory had already exhausted its resources when raising this amount and could not raise more funds. After the labor unrest is resolved, the Social Affairs Bureau still needs to decide on the handling of the aftermath. However, the original industrial union of the No. 9 Mill must be reorganized. All workers must re-register. They will be re-employed after investigation. He hopes that work can be resumed within the lunar new year.</p>

<h3 id="e105">Elder Brother Does Not Engage in Honest Work - Blaming His Infatuation with His Beloved Concubine <a href="#e105" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c105" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">105</a></h3>
<p>Woman Tragically Murdered, Body Buried in Mud Pond to Eliminate Traces, Exposure of Failure</p>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] At noon on the 2nd of this month, Chen Tianjun, a native of Suqian residing in a shack at No. 24, Lane 1166, Changning Road, reported to the Zhoujiaqiao Police Station of the Xin Jing Police Precinct that his concubine, Xu Guohua, also known as Hongbao (20 years old, native of Huai'an), had been missing for eight days, and her whereabouts were unknown. He requested an investigation. Officer Zhuang Zanxi dispatched detective Zhang Shouzhen to investigate and reported to Du Shiyan, the judicial section chief of the precinct. After 24 hours of investigation, it was learned that the so-called missing young woman was instigated by her younger brother-in-law, Chen Tianqing, to be murdered by fellow villagers Zhou Qinghua and Zhang Yongtang, who then moved her body and buried it in a mud pond on the bank of the Fan Huang Du Creek. The body was exhumed yesterday noon, and Zhou Qinghua and Zhang Yongtang were arrested (pictured). However, the principal offender, Chen Tianqing, and another accomplice, Hou Meiling, are still at large. Chen Tianjun, the husband of the deceased, was originally a lieutenant officer in the Nanjing Adjustment Warehouse of the Quartermaster General Headquarters. Last year,</p>
<p>he was laid off.</p>
<p>He then brought his beloved concubine, Ms. Xu, to Shanghai and lived in the shack at No. 24, Lane 1166, Changning Road, with his younger brother, Chen Tianqing. Subsequently, three fellow villagers who had followed Chen for many years, Zhou Qinghua, Zhang Yongtang, and Hou Meiling (all soldiers from the Adjustment Warehouse), were also laid off and came to Shanghai. Before long, Chen ran into difficulties with his finances because he had little savings, so he recently colluded with Zhou and Hou to steal a suitcase from somewhere nearby. Afterward, his younger brother learned about it and believed that his elder brother was going down the wrong path. He believed that the biggest reason his elder brother was not engaging in honest work was</p>
<p>infatuation with Ms. Xu. Therefore, he did not care about breaking the law and conceived the idea of killing Ms. Xu. On the 25th of last month, taking the opportunity of Chen's trip to Beijing, he summoned Zhou, Zhang, and Hou to discuss the matter. The three of them were also deeply afraid that the theft would be exposed, so they agreed to his request and agreed to take action on the evening of the following day. When the time came, Chen and others knocked on the door, first on the pretext of asking for a cigarette. After entering the house, they used the prepared hemp rope to forcibly strangle Ms. Xu to death. Afterward, Zhou and Hou carried the body to the bank of the Fan Huang Creek and buried it in the pre-dug mud pond, covering it with thick soil,</p>
<p>Intending to eliminate traces. Seeing his beloved concubine, he inquired everywhere, but there was no news. His younger brother claimed that Ms. Xu was probably on the run. Chen was half-believing, so he rushed to his concubine's home in Zhenjiang on the 30th to inquire, but the result was nothing. He returned to Shanghai on the 1st of this month, at which point his younger brother had also disappeared. So he went to inquire at Zhou Qinghua and Zhang Yongtang's place. Zhou was also afraid of the case being exposed and had left home. When Chen arrived unexpectedly, Zhou's wife's attitude was abnormal for a while. Zhang smiled and said, "The matter is over, so there is no need to pursue it." Chen asked if she was dead, and Zhang remained silent. At this point, Chen became more suspicious, so he reported to the Zhoujiaqiao Police Station on the 2nd. Zhang and Zhou's wife were detained for interrogation, but they</p>
<p>Refused to tell the truth.</p>
<p>So, he reported to Du Shiyan, the judicial section chief of the precinct. Immediately, people were dispatched to wait at the nearby train stations. Sure enough, Zhou Qinghua was arrested at the Zhenru train station that night. He immediately confessed and confessed to the whole story. The body was exhumed at noon yesterday. In addition to strictly arresting the fleeing criminals, the entire case will be transferred to the headquarters for questioning.</p>

<p>The New Asia Hotel on North Sichuan Road was recently leased by the U.S. Army Advisory Group as officers' quarters. A large number of waiters and laborers were recruited and employed, and they began working on January 16. Unexpectedly, former employees who had already been dismissed with compensation by the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA) rose up in opposition, demanding that the personnel management office of the U.S. military officers' quarters dismiss 41 of the newly recruited employees and replace them with the old UNRRA staff, leading to a dispute. The new employees argued that UNRRA and the U.S. Army Advisory Group were not part of the same system, and that the old UNRRA staff had already been dismissed with compensation. They questioned how such an unreasonable demand could be made again, causing them to suffer the hardship of unemployment once more. Therefore, in addition to submitting a request to the Social Bureau for legal protection, they also appointed representatives to seek assistance from all sectors of society.</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper] In late last month, Dong Yixiang, a member of the Lujiazui Branch Bureau, and officer Zhao Hengqing received a tip-off that the Hua Fu Western Medicine Store on the second floor of 115 Hankou Road was specializing in selling counterfeit drugs. Director Dong led his subordinates Zhang Han, Weng Hongxun, Feng Bojun, and Liu Xianglin to the address, seizing counterfeit drugs such as 北地那爾, 新斯梯波, 消除龍, 阿四匹靈, and 加當, arresting Jin Hesheng, 20 years old, from Shaoxing, the younger brother of the store owner, and two employees, Wang Xinwu.

They were all brought to the bureau. According to Jin Hesheng, the counterfeit drugs they sold were mainly sold in Taiwan, Jinan, and northern Jiangsu. They then went to the Central Grand Theater on Beihai Road to arrest Shi Zixiu, 21 years old, from Chongming. According to Shi, the counterfeit quinine was handmade.

<p>[Our Newspaper] Lawyer Cheng Mengming, previously sued for the return of arrears after the "postage price increase," but was rejected by Judge Ling Yuanging of the Civil Court of the District Court. Cheng complained that the judgment did not mention a word about the second supplementary pleading, and the reasons for the rejection were not sufficient. Therefore, he accused Ling of "perverting the law" in the Criminal Court of the District Court. Yesterday afternoon at 4:00 PM, Judge Cao Zuwei opened a court session for questioning. Because it was a review of the self-litigation investigation court, Judge Cao prohibited onlookers based on Article 318 of the Criminal Procedure Law. The defendant, Judge Ling Yuanging, did not appear. The plaintiff, Cheng Mengming, was summoned to court for questioning. According to sources after the session, Judge Cao first hoped that the situation in the case would not be excessively expanded. He then asked the plaintiff how he could prove that the defendant "perverted the law." Cheng claimed that the later supplementary pleading explained that an order cannot change the law, and that the proposal passed by the State Council was only a legal principle, not a law. However, Judge Ling's judgment did not mention a word about the pleading. If he had not seen the pleading at all, there would have been negligence in administration. If he had seen the pleading but deliberately did not adopt it, then he should be held responsible for "perverting the law" under the Criminal Law. One of the two must be true. After the questioning, Cheng was dismissed, and Ling Yuanging was scheduled to be questioned at a later date.</p>
<h3 id="e118">Mobilizing 20 Billion in Funds for Winter Relief Facilities in Three Months; Accommodating and Providing Work Relief for 3,000 Refugees Each; 14 Soup Kitchens Can Save 30,000 People <a href="#e118" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c118" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">118</a></h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] At a time when the end of the year is approaching and social order is fluctuating, all parties are expressing great concern about the situation of winter relief work. Wu Kaixian, the Director of the Social Affairs Bureau, specifically released a summary of the facilities of the Winter Relief Committee in the past three months as follows:</p>
<p>The current relief funds mobilized are only 20 billion, including the construction projects of 16 cold shelters, refugees' clothing, food rations, medical care, dredging equipment, and soup kitchen equipment. Relief facilities are divided into:</p>
<p>Accommodation and Support: Three cold shelters have been established. As of last month, the three shelters accommodated a total of 3,000 refugees. The refugees are given rice rations according to government regulations, with each person receiving two dou of rice per month, and a food allowance of 50,000 yuan per month. After entering the shelter, each refugee is given two sets of underwear, a cotton-padded jacket and pants, a cotton quilt, and a pair each of cloth socks and cloth shoes, as well as hygiene supplies such as towels and toothbrushes. The Third Cold Shelter, in particular, was established the latest, and its management lacked experience, resulting in poor performance. Four administrators from the Children's Education Center have been dispatched to assist. Whenever visitors arrive at the cold shelters, the refugees surround them or kneel down to beg, which has been happening in previous years. This is because most of these people are beggars, who can earn tens of thousands of yuan a day on weekdays and are not accustomed to a disciplined life.</p>
<p>Work Relief: Currently, dredging work has begun, including dredging the Jiangwan Shajing Port, Caohejing Puhuitang, Dachang Zoumatang, Pudong Dutai Pu Majiabang, and other places. In addition, several ditches are being dredged in western Shanghai. To facilitate construction and provide food and accommodation for work relief refugees, the Public Works Bureau has designed and built 13 work relief cold shelters at various construction sites, and all have been started. As of now, 3,000 refugees have participated in work relief, and more can be added successively.</p>
<p>Soup and Clothing Distribution: Eight soup kitchens are run by the committee, and six are jointly run with local communities, totaling 14 soup kitchens. The distribution locations of the soup kitchens include five in Zhabei District, one in North Station District, one in Nanshi, two in western Shanghai, two in Pudong, one in Jiangwan, one in Wusong, and one in Hongkou. The equipment and personnel management of those jointly run with local communities are the responsibility of the local communities, while the Winter Relief Committee is responsible for firewood and rice. The soup kitchens started distributing soup one after another from the first day of the new year, and can save more than 30,000 people. In addition, there is a mobile soup truck that can save 2,000 people each time it goes out. As for clothing distribution, it is currently limited to the old clothes donated by various sectors, and distribution also started from the first day of the new year. As of now, distribution has been carried out in Zhabei, North Station, Penglai, Changning, Jing'an Temple, Sichuan Road, Jiangwan, and other districts, and a total of 41,600 pieces have been distributed. As for the 5,000 sets of cotton-padded clothes recently delivered by the Women's Volunteer Corps for Cold Clothing Donation, the distribution method will be determined after Huang Yanfang provides her opinion.</p>
<p>Relief for Hidden Poverty: 200 million yuan has been allocated from the relief funds for relief for hidden poverty. Due to limited funds, the scope has had to be reduced. To date, the list of more than 60 approved households has been approved, and cash or food rice has been distributed.</p>

<h3 id="e121">The Leading City of Eastern Jiangxi: Shangrao <a href="#e121" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c121" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">121</a></h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Shangrao, Our Newspaper, 1st] A few days before the Hangzhou-Nanchang section of the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway was connected, I visited Shangrao with a joyful mood. After eleven and a half hours of being confined in a dilapidated railway carriage, the violent jolting was unimaginable to every passenger, and I was no exception. Fortunately, there was a talkative conductor on the train who chatted about everything from ancient and modern times, both Chinese and foreign, and also about the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway, which would soon be fully operational, reducing much of the endless loneliness. With great difficulty, I endured this not-so-short period of vexation and arrived at this leading city of Eastern Jiangxi at around midnight. In order to sleep more soundly, braving the cold wind, I went into the city to find a cleaner place to rest and shake off the fatigue of a day's journey.</p>
<p>Having revisited Shangrao for the fourth time, I felt that everything had changed. The clean and bustling urban prototype of the past has disappeared without a trace, and now it leaves me with an impression of disorder, filth, and decline. Shangrao was formerly the seat of Guangxin Prefecture. The city is located on the upper reaches of the Xin River and is the gateway from Jiangxi Province to Fujian and Zhejiang. The water and land transportation here are very convenient. Upstream along the Xin River, you can reach Yushan. Downstream, passing through Guixi and Yujiang, you enter Poyang Lake, which can connect the two major rivers, the Yangtze and the Gan. The highway also follows this route to become the center of eastern Jiangxi. Through Yushan, you can enter Zhejiang. There are two branches to Fujian Province, one entering Fujian via Guangfeng, and the other entering Fujian via Qianshan. There is also a trunk line extending through Linchuan and Ji'an to enter Hunan, and another branch directly reaches Nanchang. In addition, the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway runs through the three provinces of Zhejiang, Jiangxi, and Hunan. Therefore, due to its strategic location, it has become an important town in eastern Jiangxi.</p>
<p>This county town, with a population of 480,000, is not only conveniently located for transportation, but also has abundant products. The local pears and summer cloth are quite famous. Other products include Guangfeng's tobacco leaves, Yushan's vermicelli and dried bamboo shoots, Qianshan's handmade paper, Hengfeng and Yiyang's chicken, duck, and pork, and Nanfeng's oranges... All the local products of eastern Jiangxi are gathered and transshipped here. Originally, before the construction of the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway, Qianshan's Hekou Town was the distribution market for local products in eastern Jiangxi. Since the completion of the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway, Shangrao has replaced half of Hekou Town's commerce and has become a commercial city in eastern Jiangxi.</p>
<p>Shangrao's commercial district is located on West Street outside the West Gate, extending west to the vicinity of the railway station. The long street is extremely dirty and full of stench. The road surface is paved with flagstones, low in the middle and high on the sides, with many traces of cart wheels forming tracks. Therefore, it is always damp and never dry. On both sides of the street, there are many two-story buildings, which are built very simply, vulgar, and the arcades on the sidewalks are scattered and extremely uneven. From the perspective of urban appearance, it is extremely unsightly. In addition to West Street, other relatively lively streets such as Shengli Road, Tianjing Street, and Kangjian Road are also outside the city. There are no lively streets inside the city. Although Shangrao was the seat of the former Qing Prefecture, the city circle is not large. The Zhongshan Park in the northeast of the city almost occupies a quarter of the area of the entire city. Zhongshan Park is the quietest and cleanest area in the city. There is a large sports field in the park, a provincial medical vocational school, two elementary schools, a fairly grand Chiang Kai-shek Memorial Hall, and the Eastern Jiangxi Library. These buildings are said to have been built when the headquarters of the Third War Area Command was located here. Although the scenery remains the same today, the personnel are no longer the same. For example, the Eastern Jiangxi Library exists in name only. The tables and chairs in the room are all covered in dust, and there is no need to mention the library equipment. Many honorary soldiers are also stationed in the Kangjian Memorial Hall, making those who revisit it sigh at the changes between the past and the present.</p>
<p>After living in Shangrao for a few days, I felt that Shangrao's cultural undertakings were still up to standard. There is a Minfeng Daily here, which is sponsored by the Sixth District Commissioner's Office of Jiangxi Province. The newspaper is published daily in a broadsheet format. Unfortunately, the layout is not very attractive, and the supplement is also not up to standard. The circulation is limited to the counties under the jurisdiction of the Sixth District of Jiangxi Province. However, it is the only broadsheet newspaper on the Hangzhou-Nanchang section of the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway, except for Hangzhou and Nanchang.</p>
<p>The educational undertakings here are also considered to be developed, with six or seven middle schools such as Zhu Tong, Provincial Shangzhong, Provincial Medical Vocational School, County Middle School, and County Teachers' School. Before the victory, the private Chengming College of Shanghai also moved here for a period of time. When the victory was won, it moved back to Shanghai. Immediately afterwards, the Eastern Jiangxi Joint Xinjiang Agricultural College was founded, adding a gem to this mountain city. A year ago, it moved to Ehulu in Qianshan. Recently, the students of the school are launching a</p>
<p>movement to return to Rao. When I arrived in Shangrao, the Agricultural College was brewing a student strike. The student union and the alumni association sent representatives to Shangrao to appeal to all sectors of society, hoping that people from all walks of life would support their "Return to Rao Movement." From an objective point of view, it is necessary for the Xinjiang Agricultural College to move back to Shangrao, the political, economic, and cultural center of Eastern Jiangxi, because a specialized school is confined in the mountains and valleys, suffering from the strangulation of material conditions, which causes problems with school equipment, faculty recruitment, book and newspaper supply, etc. In order to solve these difficulties and improve the school, I also strongly agree with the students' request to move the school.</p>
<p>On the eve of leaving Shangrao, I talked with some local people in Shangrao about the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway being connected, and what is placed before everyone</p>
<p>There are two problems: security and epidemic prevention.</p>
<p>In today's world where bandits are everywhere, Guangchang, the old nest of bandits, is only fifty li away from Shangrao, so whether Guangchang will become a bandit's nest again is inseparable from the security of eastern Jiangxi. According to local people, the current security problem in eastern Jiangxi has not yet reached a serious stage. It seems to be much better than in the neighboring northern Fujian, eastern Zhejiang, and southern Anhui. As long as the grassroots political organizations do not arouse popular resentment, eastern Jiangxi can be quite stable.</p>
<p>Epidemic prevention is an urgent issue in Shangrao at the moment. Not long ago, the Shangrao station and Shahan Town were both plagued by the spread of the plague, and it had a prairie fire trend. Fortunately, the weather was cold and the epidemic was slightly suppressed, but it is possible to recur in the spring. This black threat makes people shudder, but the government and the people are equally short-sighted. If no patients are seen, the epidemic prevention work will stop.</p>
<p>On the way home, I also wish the people of this mountain city to be able to revive in peace, no longer suffer from the threat of the plague, and restore prosperity to the mountain city as soon as possible. (Reporter Jiang Feng from This Newspaper)</p>
<h3 id="e122">Bank Loans of 3.6 Billion to Relieve Wuhu Power Plant's Coal Shortage <a href="#e122" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c122" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">122</a></h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Wuhu, Our Newspaper, 1st] The amount of coal allocated by the Fuel Management Committee to the Mingyuan Power Plant in this city each month is far from meeting the actual needs. The plant has been requesting to borrow coal from the next month's allocation on a monthly basis to maintain operations. At the same time, the plant implements zonal power outages at night to save coal. Local people are deeply worried that once the light is lost at a time when the Lunar New Year is approaching and winter defense is tight. The power plant authorities are also trying to find ways to secure a source of coal. Regarding the 1,450 tons of coal stored in Wuhu on the Pinghan Railway, they have repeatedly negotiated with the Purchasing Department of the Railway Bureau and the Fuel Management Committee, and fortunately they have been approved. However, this coal must be deducted from the allocation for January and February, and transportation costs, unloading fees, interest, and storage fees must be paid. The allocation price of this coal is originally higher than that of the Huainan coal, so the total cost of this batch of coal reached 6 billion yuan, which must be paid off before the delivery order can be issued. Because the amount was too large, the power plant, despite its best efforts, only managed to raise one-third, leaving a shortfall of more than 3 billion. If it cannot be paid off as scheduled, the Pinghan Railway Bureau and the Fuel Management Committee may take the opportunity to change their minds, which is extremely worrying. The other day, the military and political leaders and local elders of Wuhu City invited the managers of various banks, bureaus, and treasuries to discuss solutions. Finally, all the banks, bureaus, and treasuries decided to jointly grant an emergency loan of 3.6 billion yuan to the Mingyuan Power Plant, with a time limit of 40 days. The Bank of China was designated as the representative bank to be responsible for handling all loan procedures. The coal shortage of the Wuhu Power Plant can be temporarily resolved, allowing the city to get through the Lunar New Year.</p>

<p>[Special Dispatch from Taipei, Our Newspaper, 31st] The provincial police authorities released statistics on a total of 331 smuggling cases cracked last year, including 194 inbound cases and 137 outbound cases.

<p>[Special Dispatch from this Newspaper in Wujin, 2nd] As the end of the year approaches, the business community in this county faces tight cash flow, leading to successive closures. Following the closure of the Lao Bao Hua Silver Shop, the Bao Da Xiang Silk and Cloth Store on South Street also announced liquidation starting on the 26th. After a meeting of creditors on the 27th for settlement, the total deficit was only 1.1 billion yuan. The remaining inventory and assets could cover the difference, so the issue wasn't overly significant, only that operating capital could not be secured and disagreements among shareholders made it impossible to continue, leading to the shutdown.</p>

<p>[Special Dispatch from this Newspaper in Wujin, 1st] Wujin Hospital, a leading local hospital run by the American Mission, is known for its well-equipped facilities. Recently, due to the interruption of supplies from the United States, the hospital's income has not been able to cover its expenses, leading to financial difficulties. The staff's salaries are meager, initially paid according to central government employee standards. This has recently been changed to calculation based on the cost-of-living index. The hospital still paid the January salaries according to the index from December of the previous year. The hardworking nurses felt this was unfair and repeatedly requested improvements without success. They began a work slowdown starting on the afternoon of the 27th, causing considerable anxiety among patients. The hospital has now agreed to temporarily suspend deductions for meals.</p>

<h3 id="e127">Major and Minor Fires in Lanzhou: Eight Occurrences in Half a Month <a href="#e127" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c127" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">127</a></h3>
<p>[Airmail Dispatch from this Newspaper in Lanzhou, 1st] The Fire God has frequently visited Lanzhou. In less than half a month, there have been eight fires of varying sizes. On January 15th, the Lanzhou office of the Gansu-Qinghai Branch of the China Petroleum Corporation had a small incident at 10 PM. A fireplace caught fire, igniting the ceiling. The flames blazed intensely, but quick action prevented a major disaster. On January 20th at noon, the new building of the Northwest Salt Administration caught fire. Because the walls were not plastered, 36 rooms burned down, with losses exceeding 800 million yuan, likely caused by carelessness with heating. On the same day, around 3 AM, General Zhang Zhizhong's private residence, Xinghua Village, on Zuogong West Road, also caught fire due to a faulty fireplace, destroying eight rooms and causing losses of about 200 million yuan. On January 24th, at No. 178 Linsen Road, a cotton fluffer's shop knocked over an oil lamp, burning a corner of a quilt. Fortunately, it was discovered early and extinguished. On the night of January 25th, at the home of Liu Zichang, a staff officer at the Fourth Division, Zhangjiazhuang, a stovepipe malfunction ignited a roof beam, but it was quickly extinguished. At 6 AM on the morning of January 26th, Commander Ma Xiwu's residence on the former East Road also suffered a fire caused by the same reason, destroying three rooms. On the night of January 28th, a fire also broke out at the Guanzhou Power Plant, but effective firefighting kept the damage limited. This morning, the Liangbei Wool Textile Factory also reported an accident. The intensity of the fire and the extent of the damage broke decades of records. The city's firefighting equipment has never attracted much attention, and its development is severely limited by funding. The Gansu Provincial Police Department has only about 20 firefighters and four manual water pumps. The department has decided to expand its firefighting equipment as a preventive measure and promote fire prevention awareness to the public. In addition to purchasing two gasoline-powered pumps, they will use police sirens every night to warn citizens about fire hazards.</p>
<h3 id="e128">Newly Found Gold Performed in Tianjin <a href="#e128" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c128" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">128</a></h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from this Newspaper in Tianjin, January 31st] Li Bangzi, a thirteen-year-old from No. 77 Xuhujuan outside the South Gate of this city, makes a living by collecting scraps. On the afternoon of the 24th, he went out to collect scraps again and found a gold bar in a pile of garbage on Xinxing Road in Nankai. Wang Zhongyao, another scrap collector, saw it and demanded the gold from Li. They agreed to saw the gold bar in half and divide it equally. This was rumored among several scrap collectors, and later reached the 15th Precinct of the Police Department. When Constable Zhi Changhai heard about it, he went to Li's house with several scrap collectors that evening, threatening a lawsuit in an attempt to get a share. After negotiations, they sold half the gold bar for 21 million yuan. Li received 9 million yuan, Zhi Changhai received 2.5 million yuan, the scrap collectors received a total of 5 million yuan, and the rest was distributed to other police officers. Unexpectedly, Zhi Changhai went to Wang Zhongyao to demand a share of his gold, resulting in Wang Zhongyao losing 4 million yuan. Zhang Guoxing participated in the gold distribution. Zhang felt that Li received too little and that someone was damaging Zhang's reputation, so he reported it to the police on the 28th, leading to the disclosure of the gold discovery. The police department immediately summoned and interrogated the suspects.</p>
<h3 id="e129">A Sea of Fire in the Yellow River's Ice Flow: A Record of the Burning of the Northwest Wool Textile Factory in Lanzhou <a href="#e129" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c129" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">129</a></h3>
<p>[Airmail Dispatch from this Newspaper in Lanzhou, 1st] At 2:25 AM on the morning of the 29th of last month, under a waning moon and scattered cold stars, the Northwest Wool Textile Factory in Hebei suddenly caught fire. Tongues of smoke and flames shot into the sky. At the height of the fire, the flames reached six or seven feet high. Due to the northerly wind, the wool in the combing section had already been mixed with oil and processed on the machines, causing the fire to spread rapidly. The entire machine room, spinning machines, and weaving machines were completely engulfed in flames. The crackling explosions, combined with the shouts of firefighters and the terrified screams of nearby residents, made a scene. Sparks rose continuously with the smoke column, turning half the sky red, reflected in the icy flow of the Yellow River, creating a tragic and horrifying scene!</p>
<p>Thick Smoke from the Combing Department</p>
<p>When the fire first started, a guard at the factory noticed thick smoke coming from the combing department of the factory building and immediately shouted for help. Factory workers woke up from their sleep and gathered at the site of the fire. Because the factory building was large and there were no firefighting tools, they could do nothing but run around and inform others. Hearing the shouts, the Jingyuan Road Police Station of the Sixth Precinct determined that the Northwest Wool Textile Factory was on fire and immediately reported it by telephone to the Sixth Precinct, the Fire Brigade Headquarters, and the Third and Fifth Precincts, requesting assistance. Nearby military police units, the Lanzhou Clothing Factory of the Joint Logistics Command, the Second Battalion of the Garrison Regiment, and local agencies and Baojia personnel all came to help fight the fire. Some firefighters bravely climbed onto the roof, using saws, axes, and fire hooks to demolish the steaming and dyeing machine room adjacent to the fire site to isolate the fire. Four water hoses simultaneously sprayed the center of the fire. Some police officers bravely rushed into the fire and dragged out semi-finished products and raw fabric from the machines and stored in the room. After three hours of effort, the fire was mostly extinguished by 6:30 AM. Roughly estimated, 67 factory rooms were reduced to ashes, and most of the combing, spinning, and weaving machines were destroyed, with losses often exceeding 200 billion yuan.</p>
<p>Delayed Discovery Leads to Major Disaster</p>
<p>The cause of the fire is speculated to be a burst underground flue, with sparks escaping and igniting the accumulated wool. Because electricity was cut off at night and work was suspended, all factory doors were locked from the outside. No one discovered the fire when it first started. By the time it was discovered, flames were already shooting out of the windows with thick smoke, making it impossible to control, thus leading to the major disaster.</p>
<p>After hearing the news this morning, Governor Guo of Gansu Province immediately inquired about the incident by telephone and expressed his condolences. Mayor Sun Runan and Police Chief Li Ruwei both personally went to the fire site to inspect and offer condolences. Leaders of other agencies and organizations all expressed regret over the unprecedented loss suffered by this largest-scale civilian industry in the Northwest and went to express their condolences. This reporter accompanied Mayor Sun on a tour of the disaster area this morning, guided by Qi Henian, the acting factory director's secretary. Debris was scattered everywhere, and remnants of machines were scattered throughout the courtyard. Yarn spools and raw fabric were visible everywhere, and smoke still lingered in the factory buildings. The steaming, dyeing, and washing areas to the east were fortunately unaffected.</p>
<p>Work Can Resume in Two Months</p>
<p>Regarding the fire, the factory has taken recorded photos and is preparing to send them to the Shanghai Relief Association. Around 3 PM this afternoon, Acting Factory Director Qi contacted Chairman Liu Hongsheng of Shanghai by telephone to report the fire, but the transmission was unclear, and there was no result. That night, he rushed to Shanghai to provide a detailed account of the losses and the recovery plan. At 8 PM, Qi hosted reporters at his private residence, reporting the "speculated" cause of the fire and the course of the fire. He also downplayed the losses, saying they were not as high as the rumored 200 billion yuan. Qi repeatedly stated that if the China Textile Corporation in Shanghai could allocate some machinery, he believed that work could resume in two months. Currently, they will maintain the livelihoods of the existing employees by undertaking wool washing and accepting custom dyeing orders, and they will not lay off or reduce wages under any possible circumstances. All employees of the factory are determined to grit their teeth and slowly restore the former glory!</p>
<p>Qi met with Governor Guo this afternoon to personally report the incident. According to reports, Governor Guo stated that the Northwest Wool Textile Factory is the only industrial enterprise of some scale in the Northwest, and the provincial government will provide strong support under any unfavorable circumstances to ensure that it does not collapse. Governor Guo hopes that the factory will contact the directors in Beijing and other places to determine the assistance measures. The factory was founded in 1945 with investments from Shanghai industrial and commercial magnates Luo Qingshu and Liu Hongsheng, using the financial resources of the East to aid the Northwest. Liu serves as Chairman and General Manager, and Ping Bolu serves as Associate Manager and Factory Director. Currently, both the General Manager and Deputy General Manager are not in Lanzhou, and Secretary Qi Henian is acting on their behalf. Unfortunately, this major disaster has occurred, unprecedented in Lanzhou in decades. (Reporter Song Lin)</p>

<p>He entered Japanese nationality at the age of five and has now returned to the embrace of his motherland. In his thirty-three years of life, he has experienced suffering that no one else in the world has ever encountered!</p>
<p>[Airmail Dispatch from this Newspaper in Changsha, 1st] This is a modern tragedy, a real-life story that even writers struggle to depict. The protagonist of this story is named Hirai Eizaburo, but he is a Chinese man of pure Chinese descent. Although he was a Japanese for more than twenty years, he has now returned to his motherland and is once again a citizen of the Republic of China.</p>
<p>A Farmer's Son</p>
<p>Hirai Eizaburo's family home is in a village in Linxiang County, Hunan. His father was an honest farmer named Yuan. Unfortunately, he died of illness before the age of thirty. His young mother, now a young widow, had no inheritance left by her husband to support her and her son. She had no choice but to take her beloved son to Hankou to make a living. At that time, Hirai Eizaburo was only five years old.</p>
<p>In Hankou, his mother was lucky enough to find work as a nanny in a Japanese-owned foreign firm. The manager of this firm, Hirai, fell in love with the young widow, and the widow then married this foreigner. From then on, both mother and son became Japanese citizens.</p>
<p>Foreign Adoptive Father</p>
<p>Under the care of his foreign adoptive father, Hirai Eizaburo went from elementary school to middle school to university. Because he was very intelligent, he graduated from the Department of Political Economy at Tokyo Imperial University. His habits, of course, became thoroughly Japanese. He did not even know that he was Chinese. It wasn't until he was twenty-six years old, when his mother was critically ill, that she told him his true family name and urged him to return to his motherland if he ever had the chance. Only then did he learn of his pitiful origins. From that time on, he began to think about returning to his roots and resolved to find an opportunity to return to his motherland.</p>
<p>Called to the Front Lines</p>
<p>When the Sino-Japanese War broke out, Japan had a conscription system. Whether students or professors, everyone had to enlist and go to the front lines. Non-military students were given medical training and served with the army after graduation. Hirai Eizaburo became a member of a medical team and stepped onto the soil of his motherland with the troops, returning to the embrace of his motherland.</p>
<p>Even though his motherland was in ruins at that time and his compatriots were so disappointing, he still loved it because he was Chinese.</p>
<p>He arrived in Hankou, and due to work opportunities, he met Miss Liu, a nurse at the Si Ren Hospital in Hankou. Miss Liu was from Changsha. She told him which direction Linxiang was in, where his ancestors' graves were, and where his deceased mother longed for day and night. He was extremely excited. One night, he deserted from the army and fled to the French Concession. Unfortunately, he was captured by the Japanese military police. He could not freely return to his motherland and became a prisoner.</p>
<p>War-Torn Lovers</p>
<p>The Japanese military police severely tortured him, breaking his bones and tearing his flesh. After three months, he was transferred to the Japanese military court in Nanjing and sentenced to seven years in prison. After being imprisoned for several months, he was reassigned to the military. This time he was lucky enough to be with Miss Liu again, and they served in the same unit. Working together, their friendship gradually developed into a romantic relationship, and they eventually announced their marriage in Hankou, becoming a couple who shared adversity in the war.</p>
<p>Surrender in Linxiang</p>
<p>In 1943, the Japanese army attempted to open up land transportation routes and launched the Xianggui Campaign. His unit marched to Linhu. This was his hometown, and he could no longer bear to leave it. So, he and Miss Liu managed to flee to the mountains of Linxiang and surrender to Commissioner Wang Jianbo's office. Commissioner Wang confirmed his family name and that everything matched. He learned that he had no relatives left at home, only a few old houses. He also only knew that his surname was Yuan and did not have a Chinese name. Commissioner Wang then named him "Changya." From then on, he was no longer Hirai Eizaburo of Japanese nationality, but Yuan Changya, a citizen of his motherland.</p>
<p>Although Yuan Changya had returned to the embrace of his motherland and was now a Chinese citizen, according to wartime law, those who surrendered could not simply be let off and had to undergo legal procedures. Commissioner Wang had no choice but to transfer him to Commander Wang's headquarters, who then transferred him to the Hunan High Court. The court sentenced him to two years and six months in prison for treason. He had just escaped from the shackles of a foreign country and returned to the embrace of his motherland, but unexpectedly, his motherland not only did not give him any warmth but gave him this cursed gift. In prison, he thought of his wife left in Linxiang, who had given birth to a child and had no savings, relying entirely on her two hands to farm and gather firewood in the countryside to make a living. He also thought of his mother buried in a foreign land and his half-sister... and he thought of his own tragic fate. He became pessimistic and almost mustered the courage of a Japanese to commit suicide in prison and end this suffering life. Fortunately, he was dissuaded by fellow inmates. He was also highly educated and had gone through a difficult struggle. His motherland needed his talent. After accepting the advice of others, he began to pursue a new path.</p>
<p>Prison Life</p>
<p>After the High Court sentenced him to two years and six months in prison, someone in prison helped him file an appeal because he had become a Japanese citizen at the age of five with his mother, and he did not know that he was Chinese. Later, when he found out, he still did not even have a Chinese name. His arrival in his motherland with the army was precisely his attempt to seize the opportunity to return to his motherland. How could he willingly accept the punishment of being labeled a traitor by the court? After a retrial by the Supreme Court, his sentence was reduced by half. Although he was still unwilling, what could he do? He had no choice but to abide by the law in prison. In prison, his behavior reflected his education and upbringing. He worked hard to study Chinese and prepared to dedicate himself to his motherland after his release. Earlier this month, his sentence was completed. He walked out of the prison gates. This was the first time he truly breathed the free air of his motherland. However, he was alone and penniless in Changsha. Where could he turn to in this unfamiliar place? Fortunately, Fang Beidu, a nurse at the Catholic Hospital, had once been a fellow inmate with him in prison and knew of this pitiful person's plight. He specially took him to his home and had him stay there. The colleagues at the Catholic Hospital pooled together more than 3 million yuan to enable him to return to Linxiang to meet his long-separated and suffering wife.</p>
<p>New Opportunities</p>
<p>After Yuan Changya was released from prison, he stayed in Changsha for a few days and then returned to Linxiang. He had exchanged letters with his family in Japan while in prison and learned that his adoptive father had been killed in a bombing raid, his elder brother had died in military service, and his second brother was the manager of a company. His half-sister had graduated from medical school and married an engineer. He still had an inheritance in Japan, and he planned to return to Japan to settle matters and resolve his current financial difficulties. He is thirty-three years old this year, in the prime of his life. He is knowledgeable, ambitious, has good habits, and is physically strong. Introduced by a friend, the reporter met him on the day of his departure from Changsha. His Chinese is still not very fluent. After pouring out his past, he firmly stated that he was not disappointed in his motherland at all. On the contrary, he wanted to dedicate himself to his motherland, as long as his motherland did not abandon him.</p>
<p>Early one morning in late January, he lonely boarded the Changwu Express train back to Linxiang. As the figure of Yuan disappeared into the horizon, the reporter gazed into the distance, silently blessing him: Friend, go ahead and strive for your ideal. Your motherland will not abandon you, as long as you have the courage to continue to strive. Is not a bright path ahead? (Special Correspondent Huang Chao Ru)</p>

<h3 id="e140">Tongji University Student Unrest Subsides: Hang Liwu Returns to Beijing <a href="#e140" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c140" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">140</a></h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper News] The student unrest at Tongji University, after several days of handling by Education Ministry Vice Minister Hang Liwu and the municipal authorities in Shanghai, has come to an end. Mr. Hang finished his public affairs in Shanghai and took a military plane back to Beijing last night. Before his departure, he issued the following written statement: "The central government originally intended to dissolve and reorganize Tongji University because of the student unrest caused by a portion of its students. However, after the students expressed remorse and the resumption of classes proceeded well for several days, and after repeated inspections by dispatched personnel, order has gradually been restored. Therefore, it has been decided to exempt the university from dissolution, but the Ministry will issue another order requiring the university to be strictly reorganized. The students who initiated the trouble must be identified and punished accordingly. Since the incident occurred three weeks ago, President Ding's sense of responsibility has been consistent, and the Ministry deeply trusts him. The faculty and staff of the university have also adopted a consistent and upright attitude, which is commendable and gratifying. On the day of the incident, President Ding maintained close contact with the municipal government and alumni, discussing matters closely. The rumor that he could not be found at that time was a misunderstanding. Yesterday, the presidents of various specialized colleges and universities in the city held a meeting, unanimously praising President Ding's courageous sense of responsibility. I also explained to the presidents that the central government and colleagues in the Ministry are well aware of the difficulties faced by the school authorities, which are beyond the imagination of outsiders. Since society's expectations of school authorities are so profound, achieving educational stability and academic progress requires the earnest cooperation of the government, society, and schools. Students in all schools should especially recognize the current severe domestic and international situation and understand the rights and obligations of the people during the constitutional and mobilization periods, striving to ensure that their words and actions do not exceed the bounds of the law. Regarding this incident, in addition to ordering Tongji University to undergo thorough reorganization, the Ministry has also ordered all universities where students participated in the incident to thoroughly investigate the circumstances in order to rectify the situation."</p>

<p>[Shenzhou News Agency News] News from the China Science Society in this city: Professor Zhang Zichun, Director of the Department of Astronomy at National Zhongshan University, went to the Harvard University Observatory in the United States last year for research. In December, he discovered a group of new variable stars in the southern end of the constellation Camelopardalis, at right ascension 4 degrees 5 minutes and declination 53 degrees 14 minutes. This new discovery has attracted widespread attention and interest from observatories around the world and is rightfully regarded as a supreme honor for our astronomers abroad. Dr. Shapley, Director of the Harvard Observatory, immediately telegraphed the discovery to major observatories around the world. This newly discovered variable star had previously been noticed by Dr. Detman of the Yerkes Observatory in the United States. After examining the spectrum, it was known that the star was similar to the R Coronae Borealis type variable star, and it was predicted to be another variable star, but no factual proof was obtained. Later, Professor Zhang reviewed more than 800 photographs of the area where the star was located, from 1898 to the present, and finally, between Julian days 2,429,596 and 2,429,676, he obtained the area where the star's brightness was at its minimum, proving that it was indeed a variable star. He also determined that its minimum luminosity occurred on January 17, 1940, at approximately 10.30 international photographic magnitude, and its average brightness was 8.70 magnitude. It belongs to the K type, and other characteristics are still under study. Currently, there are more than 20,000 known variable stars in the universe, but the brightness change of the R Coronae Borealis type variable star has no fixed period, so it is extremely difficult to discover. To date, only about a dozen or so are known. This type of star has an extremely high surface temperature, and the surrounding nebula contains a large amount of carbon, so it is also called a hot carbon star. The full type star spectrum is from G type to K type and has supergiant characteristics.</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper News] The Unified Scholarship Examination Committee of this city sent a letter to various schools stating that students soliciting donations for education not only waste their studies but also rarely gain practical benefits. Starting this semester, a joint scholarship program will be held to provide relief to poor students and avoid confusion and disturbance. The presidents of 25 private universities and specialized schools in this city held a meeting at the Tsinghua Alumni Association yesterday, believing that this method is well-intentioned, expressing unanimous support, and deciding to jointly publish an announcement in local newspapers to inform all students.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper News] The Shanghai Fine Arts College Student Aid Society stated that since the Shanghai Municipal Scholarship Unified Examination Committee is coordinating scholarships for poor students in various schools, students do not need to solicit donations themselves. The society has now ceased its activities, and the tickets for the drama that the society had planned to perform to raise funds have been collected and canceled.</p>
<h3 id="e144">Dawn of Agricultural Education in This City: Birth of Qibao Agricultural School, Planned and Promising <a href="#e144" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c144" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">144</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, at the invitation of a friend, I took a XiangSheng Company bus from Shanghai to Qibao. As soon as I got off the bus, I saw the enrollment advertisement for Shanghai Municipal Qibao Agricultural Vocational School. I walked through the bustling street, around the southern end of the town. A bend in the stream greeted people with a shallow smile; walking east along the stream, surrounded by slowly flowing waters, were several semi-palatial buildings. White powder walls, green tile roofs, vermilion corridor pillars, light green water pipes, verdant pines and ginkgo trees - the scenery at this angle was too delightful. Finally, I arrived at Qibao Agricultural School. Led by a receptionist, I sat down in the reception room, where the kind-hearted President Chai Zifei came in to shake hands and chat with the reporter, and accompanied me on a tour.</p>
<p>President Chai, around forty years old, with a ruddy complexion and radiant spirit, and a pair of bright eyes fully revealed his brilliance and talent. He is a local, born into a farming family. He has been the principal of Xicheng Elementary School for more than ten years and is currently an executive member of the Municipal Party Headquarters and a member of the Municipal Council. He is an extremely active and well-respected figure in Shanghai. Last year, he was supported by local people to take charge of all the preparations for the founding of the school. The school is municipal, but the municipal education funding is tight, and it can't provide any money at all. President Chai has worked hard to make something out of nothing: many of the buildings were renovated from dilapidated temples; hundreds of acres of farmland were donated by the local charity Sanshan Hall; other operating expenses were raised from local people. Qibao was once located at the junction of the city and the county, and the situation was very complicated. Fortunately, with President Chai leading the way, everyone was happy to help him succeed because of what he was doing in creating this new school. Because it is a newly established school, currently only two classes are open for both junior and senior levels. The junior level has more than 100 people, and the senior level has more than 60 people. The junior level curriculum, in addition to focusing on the agricultural labor course, is the same as ordinary middle schools. At the senior level, this semester, there are more courses on crops, animal husbandry, soil and fertilizer. There are forty-two classes a week, which is almost a quarter more than ordinary middle schools, which has to be said to be very heavy.</p>
<p>Agricultural schools are very difficult work. The reporter asked President Chai to guide him to see the agricultural farm facilities, but he told me that what he most felt was insufficient this semester was that the farm has not yet been equipped. He led the reporter to the southern end of the stream, pointing to the distant fields bounded by several cypress trees, he said that the area totals hundreds of acres, which is prepared for use as a farm. Because many fields still need to be exchanged with farmers, after several consultations, the procedures have recently been completed, and more than 60 acres have already been acquired, which can be returned to the school for cultivation when the spring harvest is collected. President Chai pointed east and west to tell the reporter: there he plans to build livestock houses, there he plans to build flower rooms, where is the nursery, where is the farm office, ... he explained the various construction plans in detail. Facing this field, the reporter imagined the scene when its construction was completed based on President Chai's plan, and he was convinced that a beautiful picture could be created in three or four years.</p>
<p>On a field to the east of the existing school buildings, President Chai pointed out to me the plans for the new school buildings to be built next semester: six classrooms, laboratories, a large auditorium, dormitories, etc., as well as a sports field. He wanted the reporter to participate in the opinions on civil engineering, but I was a complete layman and could only stammer without knowing what to say.</p>
<p>Finally, the reporter asked about the relationship between the establishment of the agricultural school and the lives of local people. President Chai told the reporter very seriously: The school has signed contracts with the Cotton Production Improvement Office of the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry and the Plant Pest and Drug Machinery Manufacturing Experimental Factory. This year, with a target of 1,000 acres of cotton fields, it will promote the planting of American cotton. Materials will be provided by the Improvement Office and the Experimental Factory, and the manpower will be the responsibility of all teachers and students of the agricultural school. If the 1,000-acre trial is successful this year, it can be increased to 6,000 acres next year. In addition, a production and marketing cooperative is also being organized. After its establishment, it will borrow money from the Central Cooperative Treasury to fund agricultural production and marketing. On the other hand, several local people have initiated the establishment of a farmers' education experimental area and have submitted a plan to the Municipal Education Bureau for approval. In short, the establishment of the agricultural school has grown up from difficulties. Every time a difficulty is overcome, the interest in handling affairs can be increased by one level. What is currently difficult is the fundraising. The total construction cost of various buildings is more than 4 billion yuan. Next semester, we must find ways to come up with a solution and complete them step by step.</p>
<p>Due to time constraints, the reporter had to say goodbye and leave. The impression gained from this visit was like watching a movie about the rural construction of the Tennessee River in the United States, and the spirit was extraordinarily excited. In today's China, to talk about strengthening the foundation of the country, what could be more important and practical than developing agricultural production! This school is the dawn of agricultural education in this city and the cradle of new agriculture in China. Not only does the nursing President Chai have the responsibility to love and nurture him, but I think every powerful Chinese person also has the responsibility to provide this baby with nourishment so that he is healthy and grows up.

<h3 id="e145">Renyu's Triumphant Performance: One Point Over Encars: Xiqing Succumbs to a Comeback; In Another Game, Donghua Forcefully Defeats Team V <a href="#e145" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c145" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">145</a></h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper News] Last night in the group basketball league, Renyu came from behind, defeating Xiqing's strong team Encars by a single point, a truly satisfying performance. The score was 36 to 34, with Renyu trailing by 15 to 20 in the first half. The entire game was exceptionally tense. From the start, after each side tied at 6 points, Xiqing consistently led by 2 or 3 points until Renyu first tied the score at 21 points in the second half. Later, there were two more ties at 24 and 27 points. Renyu took the opportunity to increase their score, ultimately winning. In the game between Donghua and Team V, Donghua trailed by 4 to 11 in the first half, catching up to tie at 15 points by halftime. Donghua maintained more stamina, gradually rising in the second half, ultimately defeating Team V by 41 to 37. The situation was tense, and the competition was fierce. In the first game of Group B, Indian vs. Xinsheng, Indian did not have enough players and declared forfeit, Xinsheng winning without a fight.</p>
<p>Donghua Wins First</p>
<p>The game between Donghua and Team V started at 6:30 pm. In the initial engagement, Zhuang Yirong opened the scoring, but Donghua struck back shortly after, with Lin Genbang scoring successively, taking the lead by 4 to 2. Team V was unwilling to be outdone, launching a full attack, with Wang Shouli, Zhuang Yirong, Zhu Mingxing, and others scoring repeatedly, taking a commanding lead of 11 to 4. Donghua adjusted its lineup, and after Long Haideng entered the game, the momentum changed immediately. By the end of the first half, the score was tied at 15 points, with the outcome undecided. After switching sides, both teams re-entered, with adjustments to their lineups. Zhuang Yirong made a layup under the basket, and Youliang immediately returned the favor. After each side scored 17, Donghua suddenly found their rhythm, with Wu Guoxiang, Long Haiyou, Ren Youliang all scoring accurately.

<p>Yesterday's rayon market was stimulated by the rise in foreign exchange rates. The opening price of No. 120 Asahi light rayon in the morning was 80 million yuan, which immediately rose.

It ended up being 4 million yuan stronger than the previous day.</p>
<p>Yesterday's factory silk market continued to be soft, and transactions were extremely rare. Because holders insisted on high prices, and those with ample funds did not buy at low prices, there were very few transactions. Only sporadic transactions of No. 12 Factory silk were made, with 1-2 dan traded at a price of 89 million yuan. The asking prices for various grades of factory silk and dried silk were about 1 million yuan lower than the previous day.</p>

(2) The agency fee cannot be rigidly stipulated to be 259.5 pounds of raw cotton. According to the current cost of living index, the provision is too far from the actual cost, so there must be a flexible provision.</p>

<p>The cartoon map then reaches between Guilin and Guiyang.</p>
<p>Superimposed image: A woman fleeing with a girl of about eight years old.</p>
<p>(In this section, it is implied that He Qi and his wife fled from Shanghai to Nanjing, Hankou, with their child Xiuzhen. In the autumn of 1938, they fled from Hankou to Changsha. After arriving in Guilin, they lived there for six years. He Qi then went to Hong Kong after arriving in Guilin, and then to Southeast Asia. During the period between Guilin and Guiyang, there were only the mother and daughter. Please note).</p>
<p>(14) On the Highway</p>
<p>(The highway from Guangxi to Guizhou)</p>
<p>A large group of refugees walks along the road. Guo Canyun and Xiuzhen are also mixed in with the crowd fleeing.</p>
<p>(15) Liuzhai, on the Guangxi-Guizhou Border</p>
<p>(End of November 1944)</p>
<p>Refugees, wounded soldiers, and troops fill this small town. Everywhere there are people, vehicles, and refugee stalls, a variety beyond description. Suddenly, an air raid alarm sounds, and the people panic and flee in all directions. Canyun and Xiuzhen are also mixed in the crowd. "Close-up": At this moment, she still has a small suitcase and a bundle in her hands. Then comes the sound of anti-aircraft guns as they struggle to run in the crowd, because enemy aircraft are spotted overhead. "Close-up" immediately followed by the sound of bombs exploding. Thick smoke and fire rise everywhere, and many houses in the town are destroyed, with heavy casualties. Canyun is covered in dust and her face is ashen. She only carries a bundle; the small suitcase has obviously been lost. She shouts loudly, "Xiuzhen! Xiuzhen! Xiuzhen! Xiuzhen!" But no one answers. Anxious, she cries and asks everyone she meets if they have seen a girl of seven or eight years old, but everyone says they haven't. Canyun searches everywhere, and even goes to identify bodies among the many people killed by the bombing, but to no avail. On the other hand, a Red Cross relief vehicle is parked near the bombed area. The relief workers carry the injured women and children onto the vehicle one by one. The vehicle is filled with a dozen people and then drives away. Xiuzhen is one of those rescued by the Red Cross relief vehicle. Canyun just missed it and is afraid she won't be able to find Xiuzhen.</p>
<p>(16) Guiyang Duyun Refugee Relief Association</p>
<p>Canyun (Canyun is now thirty-seven or thirty-eight years old) fled to Duyun, not only exhausted but has become a 100% refugee. It is impossible to tell that she was once a wealthy lady. She goes to the Refugee Relief Association to inquire about her daughter's whereabouts, walking into an office and seeing an administrator working there. There are many refugees in the room.</p>
<p>Canyun: Excuse me, sir, are you in charge of refugee relief?</p>
<p>Administrator: Yes, what can I do for you?</p>
<p>Canyun: I fled here from Guilin. My daughter was lost when enemy planes bombed Liuzhai. I've searched all the way here but haven't found any news. Now everyone is fleeing to Guiyang, but I have no relatives there, and I don't know what to do. I have relatives in Hongjiang, Hunan. I don't know if there's a way to get there from here?</p>
<p>Administrator: Yes, there is a waterway not far from here to Hongjiang. You can take a civilian boat.</p>
<p>Canyun: But sir, I lost all my money and valuables in Liuzhai (in a difficult situation). I have no money now...</p>
<p>Administrator: That doesn't matter. We have refugee boats to send refugees downriver. If you are willing to take a boat, I can give you a boat ticket.</p>
<p>Canyun: I am willing.</p>
<p>Administrator: (Immediately fills out a boat ticket and hands it to her.) A boat with favorable winds will leave tomorrow. Please come to the Relief Association early tomorrow morning, and someone here will take you to the place where you can board the boat.</p>
<p>Canyun: Thank you very much. (Takes the boat ticket and exits.)</p>
<p>(17) Guiyang City Street (December 4, 1944, Afternoon)</p>
<p>A corner of the Guiyang city square. Many people hurry back and forth, their faces showing panic, worry, and confusion. Many people are whispering to each other. From their various expressions, it can be seen that everyone believes the overall situation is hopeless. Suddenly, a newsboy loudly shouts as he sells extras.</p>
<p>Newsboy: (Holding a roll of newspapers under his left arm. Holding a sheet of extra high in his right hand, he shouts as he walks.) Extra! Extra! Five yuan a copy! Selling extras! The enemy has reached Dushan! The frontline troops are putting up a strong resistance in Pingzhou! (Many people hear the newsboy's shouts and become even more anxious. Everyone scrambles to buy extras. After several people buy them, the newsboy shouts and walks away.)</p>
<p>Person A (Having bought an extra and read it.) It says that another group of enemies has already reached the vicinity of Duyun. So the large bridge near Duyun has already been destroyed. What will happen if we can't resist the enemy?</p>
<p>Person B: What to do? Do you want to run? Where to run to? I heard that Commander-in-Chief Chiang has sent Chief of Staff He to oversee Guiyang. He arrived yesterday. Commander Tang has also gone to the front lines to command. The devils have penetrated deep into the mountains of Guizhou. They're just coming here to die. What's there to be afraid of?</p>
<p>(18) Emergency Meeting (December 10, 1944)</p>
<p>Around 4:00 PM. About twenty or thirty leaders from the Party, government, and military in Guiyang hold an emergency meeting in a conference room to address the current situation. The meeting is in progress. Deputy Commander Zhang rushes in.</p>
<p>Chairman: (The chairman of the meeting) The situation is so urgent. I hope that everyone will take responsibility and work hard to carry out the many things we just decided on...</p>
<p>(Just as the chairman finishes speaking, Deputy Commander Zhang enters the conference room and greets everyone. The chairman asks Deputy Commander Zhang to sit on a chair to his right and continues to speak.)</p>
<p>Now that Deputy Commander Zhang has arrived, we invite him to tell us about the situation on the front lines. (Everyone applauds to show their welcome.)</p>
<p>Commander: (Standing up to report) Chairman, gentlemen, the first thing I want to report to everyone is that the fighting on the front lines has stabilized. (Everyone is happy to hear this, and applause breaks out.)</p>
<p>Brothers, I rushed back to Guiyang from Machangping this morning. The enemy in Dushan has indeed been driven back by us. Our troops recaptured Dushan City yesterday afternoon. The enemy twenty li near Duyun are being attacked by our land and air forces and are also retreating southward, and we are currently pursuing them. So, in terms of military affairs, please rest assured. But in the Duyun, Guiding, and Longli areas, there are about hundreds of thousands of refugees flooding towards Guiyang like a tide. Once they arrive, not only will housing be a problem, but food will be an even bigger problem. If it is not handled well, the security of Guiyang is really worrying. I reported this to Chief of Staff He on the phone last night. I don't know if everyone has discussed a good solution yet?</p>
<p>Chairman: Regarding this matter, yesterday's meeting already decided to establish a Refugee Relief Committee to be responsible for handling everything. Now we are preparing shelters. All agencies, schools, and large residences in Guiyang City can be arranged as refugee reception centers. At the same time, we are also considering how to transport the refugees away. This is closely related to transportation and we are currently discussing it with the Rear Service Department. This is Mr. Gu, the director of our Relief Committee. (Gu and Zhang exchange brief greetings.)</p>
<p>Commander: That's very good. It is the responsibility of us soldiers to fight hard on the front lines. Everything in the rear must trouble you all. (He sits down after speaking.)</p>
<p>Chairman: Thank you, Deputy Commander Zhang, for bringing us good news. The meeting is adjourned. I hope everyone will work hard to prepare everything separately. (The chairman stands up to adjourn the meeting.)</p>
<p>(19) Near the Suburbs of Guiyang</p>
<p>(Mid-December 1944)</p>
<p>The weather is freezing and bitterly cold. Remnants of snow can be seen in the fields on both sides of the highway, and there is also accumulated snow on the distant mountains. On the highway near Guiyang City, thousands upon thousands of refugees are surging towards Guiyang City like a tide. There are old and young, men and women. Except for a few strong people, most of them have pale faces, obviously having fled for a long time without a full meal. The vast majority are walking, supporting the elderly and carrying the young. Occasionally, a dilapidated small car is spotted, filled with seemingly wealthy refugees. Bundles, bedding, and luggage are tied behind and on top of the car. Suddenly, one or two sedan chairs arrive, carrying old or sick refugees. A large truck is packed with more people than it can carry, and they all look sick. Many people walking are using various kinds of canes. Some are made of bamboo, some are made of small tree trunks, and some are genuine canes. The clothes worn by the refugees are strange and varied; except for a few who are still dressed well, most are ragged. Most ridiculous is an old man with a full beard wearing a woman's cheongsam. Many female refugees are actually wearing military uniforms, some female refugees wearing a short military uniform over a cheongsam, and there are also male and female refugees wearing long clothes and military caps on their heads. There are husbands pulling horses and wives riding on the horses, and there are children riding on the backs of oxen, with their fathers and brothers taking care of them as they walk. Occasionally, a young woman wearing high-heeled leather shoes and walking slowly is seen. Many people don't even have straw sandals. Some walk with their feet wrapped in rags and cotton, some young men support the elderly, some men and women carry children on their backs, and some mothers lead several children, fearing they will get lost, tying their children around their waists with ropes. There are also innocent and lively children following everyone without understanding what is happening. The refugees carry all kinds of luggage, and there is nothing that is not there. Some refugees carry it themselves, some carry it on shoulder poles, and some carry it together. Among the many refugees, some retreating soldiers are often mixed in. Some have neat military uniforms, some have untidy ones, some carry rifles and pistols, and some are unarmed. Red Cross trucks are often seen carrying wounded soldiers and sick refugees, moving slowly through the refugee crowd, with their horns honking to make way for the refugees.</p>
<p>In Guiyang City, a large building can be seen here, with the sign "Guiyang Finance Department" on the left and "First Refugee Reception Center" hanging on the right. Another place has "Guizhou Provincial Party Headquarters" hanging on the left and "Fifth Refugee Reception Center" on the right. Still another place has "Guizhou Branch of the Youth League" hanging on the left and "Third Refugee Reception Center" on the right, with "Star Grand Theater" above and "Twenty-second Refugee Reception Center" below.

<p>— Lü Lianggeng</p>
<p>Heroes are easy to come by, sages are difficult. There are more writers than talented scholars.</p>
<p>The difference between the former lies in correct action and the ability to distinguish right from wrong. The difference between the latter lies in the level of innate talent.</p>
<p>The greatest writing of all ages is formed from blood and tears.</p>
<p>This statement is similar to that of the Western philosopher Nietzsche: "The greatest writing in the world is written in blood."</p>
<p>The word "emotion" is what maintains the world. The word "talent" is what embellishes the universe. If there were no emotion or talent to maintain it, the world would have ceased to exist long ago.</p>
<p>There are those whose appearance is ugly yet admirable, and those who are not ugly but not worth admiring. There is writing that is unpolished yet lovely, and writing that, while polished, is extremely repulsive. These things are not easily explained to shallow people.</p>
<p>Ingenious ideas and inspiration from beyond. Truly understanding the essence of a saying can be considered the destiny of writing.</p>
<p>Better to be cursed by petty people than despised by gentlemen.</p>
<p>This is similar to Lu Xun's saying: "Better to be cursed to death by heroes than praised by bastards." They happen to agree without prior consultation.</p>
<p>Each flower must be seen in bloom, each moon must be seen full, each book must be seen finished, each beauty must be seen in high spirits, only then is there reality. Otherwise, it will all be for naught.</p>
<p>Such insight shows that Xinqi is truly a sentimental person. Doesn't he know that imperfections in the world are the most intriguing? The most beautiful things are those that can be imagined but not attained. Once obtained, they are nothing more than that! Wang Guowei once wrote a poem saying: "Having reached Penglai, one finds Penglai shallow!"</p>
<p>It is not advisable to be overly meticulous in everything, but one must be meticulous in reading. It is not advisable to be not obsessed with anything, but one must be obsessed with doing good.</p>
<p>Why forget the most important saying: "One must be obsessed with using emotion."</p>
<p>Small grievances in the heart can be dispelled with wine. Great injustices in the world cannot be dispelled without a sword.</p>
<p>Li Bai's heroic drinking and killing is the true color of a poetic hero.</p>
<p>If one must flatter, then do so with words, not with writing. If one cannot help but scold, then also do so with words, not with writing.</p>
<p>Ink leaves traces. Whether flattering or scolding, it is simply not worth it.</p>
<p>Reading "Water Margin" up to Lu Da beating Zheng Guanxi and Wu Song killing the tiger, one thinks that life must have at least one satisfying event to not be wasted in this life.</p>
<p>Nine out of ten things in the world are unsatisfactory! How many satisfying things are there in life? But one must strive for them.</p>
<p>The spring breeze is like wine, the summer breeze is like tea, the autumn breeze is like smoke, the winter breeze like mustard.</p>
<p>And what about the winter wind? The north wind is so cold, like bitter medicine, making it unbearable.</p>
<p>One should model one's character on the Song dynasty Confucians, and one should incorporate the free-spiritedness of the Jin dynasty into one's engagement with the world.</p>
<p>Confucianism and free-spiritedness do not hinder each other.</p>
<p>One cannot be without pride, but one cannot have arrogance. Without pride, one is close to being a vulgar person. With arrogance, one cannot be a gentleman.</p>
<p>Xinqi's second layer of interpretation has some problems. We want our hearts to be higher than the sky and our eyes to be above the top. Without pride, how can one establish oneself in the mundane world? Without arrogance, how can one criticize the current trends? If one were to abandon one's principles and conform to the world, I would never do that!</p>
<p>Sages are the substitutes of heaven and earth. (Continued sentence) Beauties are the representatives of wind and moon. One who can be free from what the world is busy with can then be busy with what the world is free from.</p>
<p>Those who find leisure in busyness are interesting people. Those who find busyness in leisure are intelligent people. The most terrifying thing is to be idle, bored, and busy with nothing!</p>
<p>Writing a new book is a great undertaking for thousands of years. Annotating an ancient book is truly a great achievement for ten thousand generations.</p>
<p>This is the self-narration of the author of "Idle Dreams," who deeply understands the joys and hardships. This is why I am willing to annotate Xinqi's "Idle Dreams." When the temperaments are similar, it is believed that the meeting of minds is not far away. The author's painstaking efforts, meticulous design, and painstaking operation should all be conveyed in detail! Although I dare not claim to be a great achievement for ten thousand generations, I want to speculate on the Dharma eye.</p>

<h3 id="e180">The Latest in the World of Literature <a href="#e180" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c180" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">180</a></h3>
<p>— Zhao Jingshen</p>
<p>The Literary Scene in Turkey</p>
<p>Turkish writers, both during the war and now, tend towards America, especially during Truman's presidency. In the past, Turkey was inclined towards England.</p>
<p>Turkey's American inclination can be seen in a recent book, "Dreamland," written by the young Turkish female writer Sakibe Soyukut. She studied in America and, after returning to Turkey, told her compatriots about this magical Western land. This book has a Hollywood flair—but this is exactly what the Turkish market needs. In the eyes of merchants in Ankara, "American" is the easiest commodity to sell. Even if it is clearly a British product, the girls selling sewing needles will shout "American!"</p>
<p>Several books about America have already been translated into Turkish. The most successful is Phyllis Bentley's "Ishte Amerika," as well as Andre Maurois's "History of America," and a collection of essays generally discussing America, which were originally published in Turkey's best-selling newspaper, Vatan.</p>
<p>The Turkish book market almost follows American bestsellers. For example, the translation of Elliott Roosevelt's book used the strange name "I Admit," and Victor Kravchenko's "I Chose Freedom" was also translated. Henry Wallace's "The Century of the Common Man" (translated as Halk Asri) has also been published. Wendell Willkie's "One World" is translated as Tek Blr Dunya.</p>
<p>Booksellers in Ankara say that the most popular American books are those by Pearl Buck and Bromfield. The most popular American popular novel is Kathleen Winsor's "Forever Amber." The Turkish translation only translates the word "Amber," a term Turkey adopted from Arabic.</p>
<p>As for Turkey's own literature, it is still very narrow and cannot be compared to that of the West. The only internationally known female writer is Halide Edib, who is currently teaching in Istanbul. She introduces the new Turkey, both domestic and international issues, to the West. Apart from her, the rest of the writers are probably only known within the country.</p>
<p>Modern Turkish writers are absolutely nationalistic. During Kemal's rule, there was no national awakening because at that time there were many countries, and Turkey was just one of them, only a larger country. Someone wrote a biography of the current president, Ismet Inonu. In addition, recent publications are about Turkish art, archaeology, history, and education. Turkey has turned to Rousseau's education, and his "Emile" has already been translated.</p>
<p>Many people in Turkey read books, and selling books is quite profitable. There are many bookstores in every city, but there are very few original Western books, probably due to the influence of foreign exchange. The Turkish government does not pay much attention to libraries. The largest one is located in the House of Representatives in Ankara, but there are very few new books, not even as good as a middle school library in America. The United States Information Service has established a library in the embassy, but most people do not approach it.</p>
<p>The Turks are very eager to learn about modern American literature. They also hope that American literature professors can come to teach, and they hope to have a large-scale exchange of teachers and students.</p>

<h3 id="e181">Snowy Lanzhou <a href="#e181" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c181" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">181</a></h3>
<p>— Junzuo</p>
<p>I flew to Lanzhou from Shanghai on January 19th. As soon as I got off the plane, I felt that the climate was a bit strange. The sky was clear for thousands of miles, but the crystal cold was like the summit of Mount Emei. The friends who came to the airport to pick up guests were all wrapped in fur coats, only revealing a section of their eyebrows, which could be distinguished. That night, I washed my feet and went to bed in my residence. When I looked the next morning, the water I used to wash my feet was frozen into ice.</p>
<p>I have been back in Lanzhou for a week. In this week alone, it has been seventeen or eighteen degrees below zero every day. The cityscape of Lanzhou is a kind of light, powdered, silver attire, like an exquisite and peerless beauty in a jade pavilion, who cannot bear the cold at great heights. Ice flowers and snow blocks are visible everywhere in the streets and alleys. Pedestrians are curled up like hedgehogs. The ear-splitting east wind is terribly cold, and some of the old men's beards are frozen into ice hooks.</p>
<p>The fantastic impression given to people from the southeast is that the charm of the northwest snowfall is extraordinary. The day before yesterday night, the moon was bright in the sky, without a speck of dust. The fluttering white snow rippled in the moonlight. Mount Gaolan stood majestically in the south, shining in the moonlight and snow, still faintly enveloped in a thin mist. Such a wonderful sight, has the Jiangnan region ever seen? Yesterday morning, I pushed open the window and looked out. What a big sun, and the snow was still flying so frantically, the layers colorful, sketching the entire Lanzhou. Although the sun was shining brightly, the snow did not melt, one layer covering another. Overnight, it was four or five inches thick, like ground powder, unable to see the six-petaled snowflakes. Such a wonderful sight, has the Jiangnan region ever seen?</p>
<p>The sun comes out on one side, the moon comes out on the other, and snow falls on the other. What is the reason for this? Can climatologists enlighten me a little bit? People who have lived in Lanzhou for a long time are used to it and don't find it fantastic. Only lonely people, distant guests, have some fresh feelings.</p>
<p>Although the climate is so severe, if you compare it with Shanghai, the winter in Lanzhou is still lovely. Generally, most agencies and homes burn coal stoves. There is a A'qian town very close to Lanzhou City, which is rich in coal. The warmth of the entire city depends on it. The "Democracy Chief" of A'gan Town is Chairman Guo Jiyao of Gansu Province. Although the outside temperature is as low as seventeen or eighteen degrees below zero, the indoor temperature is often kept as warm as the gentle spring sunshine. Wearing a thin cotton robe is enough. The market price of coal is recently 1.6 million yuan per ton. What about Shanghai? Shanghai generally cannot afford to burn coal, and the largest hotels are stingy with the opening of their radiators. In Shanghai, it is cold outdoors and cold indoors, but Lanzhou is not like that. As long as you dress in fur from head to toe before going out, the onslaught of the severe cold will ultimately be useless.</p>
<p>Winter in Lanzhou is not desolate. Coupled with the boundless ice and snow, the ice skating movement is popular. Zhongshan Forest and Lanyuan, the cultural heart of the region, each have a larger skating venue, and thousands of people skate there all day long. On the Yellow River, which is not completely frozen, in the fields, and in the squares, there are natural ice rinks everywhere, and everywhere you see brave skaters. People in the northwest are not afraid of the cold, can endure hardship, and have drive. If they fall, hurt their backs, or break their tibia, they still skate as usual, until the snowflakes stop flying and the ice melts, which is probably already in the second or third month of spring. At that time, "Suddenly overnight, the east wind comes, and thousands of trees and thousands of trees bloom with pear flowers," and they will soon go to Anningbao to enjoy the peach blossoms. If Lanzhou's ice skating "permanent knives" were not sold for one or two hundred thousand yuan a pair, but were more accessible to the common people, then this kind of winter recreational movement would definitely be more enthusiastic and widespread.</p>
<p>I miss Shanghai, and I miss my friends in Shanghai even more. In the midst of the flames of war, in the midst of the boundless ice and snow, I send this unrestrained and surging enthusiasm in this corner of the great northwest to my friends, just let it burn like coal. (Sent from Lanzhou on January 26)</p>

<p>— Copper Camel</p>
<p>Six-year-old Manwen used to be extremely dull. A year ago, whether it was simple matters like feeding himself and dressing, or playing with other children, Manwen seemed like a mentally deficient child.</p>
<p>His parents had despaired of Manwen, assuming that even if he didn't remain mentally deficient when he grew up, he would be an idiot. A doctor suggested they try a new medicine for the brain.</p>
<p>Since taking this medicine, Manwen's mental immaturity has gradually disappeared. He can now put on shoes, button his buttons, and play with children his age. If he continues to improve like this, his intelligence will be the same as that of a normal person when he grows up.</p>
<p>At this moment, there is indeed something that can be sold as food for the brain. This is a recent discovery by scientists: "Glutamic acid," extracted from protein. After taking it, it can make children intelligent.</p>
<p>A group of children with intellectual disabilities were fed a food containing this "brain food," and tested with intelligence tests, and they were found to have made significant progress. In fact, the mental development of some of these children was faster than that of normal children of the same age.</p>
<p>According to research, glutamic acid is the only chemical agent among amino acids that can be directly assimilated by brain tissue. After the acid interacts chemically with brain tissue, it can be converted into subtle electricity, promoting nerve activity and intellectual progress. Three scientists in New York are studying the relationship between glutamic acid and intelligence.</p>
<p>They selected nine children and gave them glutamic acid for six months, and they made significant progress in intelligence. The average score on the intelligence test in the first month was 107, and after six months, the average score was 120.</p>
<p>One two-year-old child had an intelligence level of only eight months. After half a year of taking glutamic acid, the child's intellectual development exceeded what it should have been in six months. Another child's intelligence was equal to his actual age: four years old. After eating this new drug for six months, his intelligence was equal to that of a normal child of six years and four months.</p>
<p>This is the first experiment on this new amino acid's ability to improve human thinking ability. It was initially tested on mice. Mice that had taken the acid were able to find a box containing food in a complex path in half the time it took mice that had not taken the acid.</p>
<h3 id="e183">Ingredients <a href="#e183" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c183" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">183</a></h3>
<p>— Fang Ren</p>
<p>Among the daily necessities for public service personnel—rice, coal, sugar, oil, and salt—coal is the most troublesome. The inconvenience of purchasing and transporting it goes without saying, but when you put a coal briquette into the stove, it often doesn't light. When it finally does, the fire is very weak, and whether you're boiling water for tea or cooking rice, it takes a long time to get anything done. If you need to rush to work after eating, you'll often be late. The family doesn't know how many complaints they've made about burning coal briquettes, but since that's what we're allocated, there's really nothing to say.</p>
<p>This is naturally a problem of ingredients. Because coal briquettes are made by mixing coal and mud, more coal makes them easier to burn, and more mud makes them harder to burn, so a weak fire is inevitable.</p>
<p>Analyzing the ingredients of coal briquettes shouldn't be difficult, but no one pays attention to it, so coal merchants can be unscrupulous.</p>
<p>I remember when I was young, because I was physically weak, adults often made me take tonic pills made of Chinese medicine. Although the instructions for the tonic pills differed in their descriptions of the medicinal properties, there were two sentences that were always the same. What were those two sentences? They were "Although no one sees the compounding, Heaven knows the intention." Because the authenticity of the pills couldn't be seen on the surface, and the effects were very subtle, everyone believed them without a doubt based on these two sentences. Perhaps people were more honest back then, and the composition of the pills wouldn't have differed too much from what was claimed.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, today's coal merchants don't rely on "Heaven knows" intentions like those past medicine merchants, and they're not accustomed to applying science. No wonder coal briquettes, which should contain more coal, are mostly mud, and tap water, which shouldn't contain salt, is salty.</p>
<h3 id="e184">Reflections on Year-End Thanksgiving <a href="#e184" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c184" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">184</a></h3>
<p>— Nian Hong</p>
<p>Every year at the end, there is always a year-end thanksgiving ritual. This custom, tinged with superstition, is deeply rooted among our people. Even though the Gregorian calendar has been established for more than thirty years, as the Lunar New Year approaches, the price of paper ingots in incense shops and chicken, duck and meat in the market all increase several times. Although people are constantly lamenting the economic downturn, the long-standing custom of year-end thanksgiving and worship of the gods remains unchanged, and the scale has not diminished.</p>
<p>The reason why humans are called intelligent animals is the responsibility of the gods, because the gods are always astute and excel at using the lowest cost to obtain the greatest reward. And we descendants of Yan and Huang are even more intelligent. Even before the gods, who are praised as supreme, sacred, pure and bright, we still apply a set of human tricks appropriately. In addition to kowtowing with utmost respect, we also offer sacrifices of livestock, wine, dishes, fruits, and finally burn a large string of gold and silver ingots and paper money in the fragrant red candles to send them off, euphemistically called "filial piety." We piously offer wine and silently pray, hoping that everything will go smoothly in the coming year and that good fortune will come. Trying to exchange paper products for real objects is truly "throwing a brick to attract jade," a truly brilliant move. Chicken, duck and dishes are in the name of sacrifice to worship the gods, but in reality, it is to satisfy one's own appetite. The pity is that whether the so-called gods are all fictitious, or whether they are respected as gods and are not moved by profit. In fact, every year every household always offers year-end thanksgiving and worships the gods, but every year every household does not necessarily have enough food and clothing. On the contrary, except for a minority of the minority who can suddenly become rich, most are getting worse and worse, one year is not as good as another, a family in relative comfort has been reduced to barely making ends meet, and those who barely make ends meet are already unable to continue their livelihood.</p>
<p>However, those who offer year-end thanksgiving still offer year-end thanksgiving, because although this year has been full of misfortunes, the future is still long, and we always hope that next year will be enlightened. Based on this hope, although incense and ingots are expensive, they are absolutely indispensable. When praying, they are also particularly pious, and dare not have half a complaint about this year's misfortunes, but just kowtow like pounding garlic, entrusting their hope to the unknown future.</p>
<p>The result of being particularly pious is being particularly embarrassed, but the determined people do not think that this is because the heavenly gods have received courtesy every year but do not give any reward, and still always think that their attitude of kowtowing is not respectful enough, and that the wine and dishes are not rich enough, so they are angered by the gods. On the other hand, if you are sure that you are sincere, then "sincerity is efficacious", "heaven will not fail those who have worked hard", and the gods can always "grant every request" for slight wishes.</p>
<p>In the end, if you ask yourself whether the effort of being upright and sincere has been done to the fullest, and the wine, dishes and sacrifices have also been exhausted, and you have given all that you have, but the embarrassing situation has become worse, then the fault is of course still unavoidable, the fault is only your previous life's "fate".</p>
<p>This is the reason why people offer year-end thanksgiving every year and are poor every year.</p>
<h3 id="e185">Rickshaw Puller and Dancer <a href="#e185" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c185" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">185</a></h3>
<p>— Bao Zhongzuo</p>
<p>One day, I passed by a dance hall and saw a fashionably dressed woman arguing with a rickshaw puller. Of course, such a situation is obviously a dispute over the fare. Although people walking on the streets of Shanghai have become accustomed to such quarrels and are not surprised, looking at the identities and appearances of these two protagonists, this scene is obviously a bit out of tune.</p>
<p>Therefore, I imagine: the identity of the rickshaw puller can be determined undoubtedly. He pulls the rickshaw, moves his legs apart, and runs around the street, driven by life. His dispute with customers over the fare is understandable from the perspective of a kind rickshaw puller. On the contrary, a rickshaw puller who is insatiable and does not keep his promises, his quarrel with customers is not worthy of sympathy.</p>
<p>Let's talk about the fashionably dressed modern woman. Although I don't know what kind of person she is, I guess she belongs to the category of dancers. Based on this assumption, I can't help but have many thoughts.</p>
<p>Let's not talk about the right and wrong of their quarrel, let's look at their environmental encounters: the appearances of the rickshaw puller and the dancer are completely different. The former is ragged, barefoot, vicious, and extremely poor; the latter is gorgeously dressed, wears high-heeled shoes, and is "overwhelmingly beautiful." However, after thinking carefully, the rickshaw puller and the dancer are both people who have fallen from the world. Earning a living by "footwork" is also a last resort. Both the round and square toes are the same, why do they have to quarrel?</p>
<p>Do you still remember the ban "rickshaws will be gradually phased out and eliminated" a few years ago? Isn't it the same as today's "dance halls will be gradually shut down"? Although the rickshaws are still running on the Shanghai Bund today, I won't discuss it; whether the dance halls will be completely banned by the end of September is unknown because the time has not yet come. If you look at the reality, what is the difference between rickshaw pullers and dancers?</p>
<p>I once had a delusion. If you add up the number of times the dancer revolves and dances in the dance pool, then the distance she has traveled under her feet is really an amazing number, perhaps comparable to that of the rickshaw puller. The only difference is that the rickshaw puller's rickshaw pulling is "vectorial", while the dancer's dancing is just spinning around in the pool, and there is no other purpose other than entertainment.</p>
<p>The dancer only has one youth. When she gets old, her appearance will decline. Like an old and tired rickshaw puller, how many people will pay attention to you?</p>

<p>Ollier, a member of the French Academy of Medicine, wrote "Reaching the Age of One Hundred", and himself lived to be one hundred and three years old. Ollier once told an interesting story; one day in 1554, Bishop Dumanoir saw an 80-year-old man sitting at his door crying. The bishop asked him why he was crying, and the old man replied that he had been beaten by his father. The bishop found it strange and wanted to see this father. Guided by the 80-year-old man, the bishop arrived at the house and met a father who was healthy and had the appearance of a child with white hair, aged 113. The old man told the bishop that the reason he beat his son was because this "kid" saw his grandfather and walked past without even saying hello. It was because this kid was too disrespectful, so he was punished. The bishop then met the great-grandfather—already a 143-year-old man.</p>

<p>Chapter 9: Leaking Secrets (62)</p>
<p>Xiao Bai listened, feeling both annoyed and amused. He then made a few perfunctory remarks. Zhu Zhai saw that there was nothing else to do and hurriedly left again. After Zhu Zhai left, Xiao Bai sat alone in the room, carefully studying the matter. He felt that it was possible for Zhu Zhai to run away and get married outside without his family's permission. To prevent this from happening, Zhu Zhai's father would have to step in to make it legitimate, but if he didn't handle it well, it could lead to worse consequences. Xiao Bai sat for a while, then lay down for a while, smoking several pipes of incense, and finally came up with an idea. Because there was no performance at the restaurant tonight, after eating dinner, it was already past nine o'clock. He took a car straight to Xu Yuru's house. Because he knew that Yuru's temper was very stern and impatient, if he told him everything, Yuru would definitely get angry and call Zhu Zhai back and scold him, which would only make things worse. So, when he met him, he didn't dare to say it directly, and first talked about some trivial matters. Later, he slowly inquired about Zhu Zhai's recent situation. Yuru then complained: "I am confident that my mind is very open. After Zhu Zhai started a family, I thought it would be good for him to organize a small family outside, so that he could gain more experience. Your second sister doesn't agree. Lately, not only doesn't this daughter-in-law come to see me, but even Zhu Zhai doesn't show his face! Your second sister complains about me all day long, saying that I married a daughter-in-law and lost a good son. Now is this kind of era, every family is like this, what can I do!" Xiao Bai smiled and said: "It is not necessarily a bad thing for them to organize a complete small family. I am afraid that they will recklessly do things outside with their young temperaments. It would be better to call them to move back home to live together, and under your supervision, they will know the principles of living at home and dealing with people." Xiao Bai had just said this when Yuru's wife interjected: "Second brother, what you said is right. I also think so. When a new daughter-in-law enters the door, she must know all the rules of the family. Living separately is not appropriate." Xiao Bai said: "There are good and bad aspects to this, it all depends on what they do. I have something to tell you, but this is just hearsay, not confirmed. You two are smart, don't get angry." Yuru and his wife asked very attentively: "Is Zhu Zhai making any jokes outside?" Xiao Bai said: "According to what I have heard, Zhu Zhai and his wife are not very harmonious." Yuru said: "I have also heard about this." Xiao Bai said: "Recently, they are getting a divorce, because Zhu Zhai wants to marry someone else." Yuru listened, unable to hold back his temper, and said impatiently: "This is outrageous, I must call him back and strictly discipline him." Xiao Bai said: "I told you not to get angry! Do you know who Zhu Zhai wants to marry?" Yuru said: "I think it must be Zhang Yunqing. They have been together since they were children. This time Zhu Zhai's marriage was forced by the situation, and he was very reluctant. I see this situation very clearly." Xiao Bai said: "You guessed wrong. Even if Zhu Zhai has this intention, the famous and virtuous lady may not be willing to seize someone else's husband. It's not her, it's the now very famous Gu Qihuan in the opera world." Yuru said in shock: "What! Gu Qihuan? I often see this name in the newspaper. It is unreasonable for Zhu Zhai to marry her."</p>

<p>During a speaking tour, Mark Twain arrived in a small town in California. Before dinner, he went to the barber shop for a shave.</p>
<p>"You're new to town, aren't you?" the barber asked.</p>
<p>"Yes," Twain said, "This is my first time here."</p>
<p>"You're in luck," the barber said, "Mark Twain is giving a speech here tonight, I suppose you're going?"</p>
<p>"Oh, I guess I probably am."</p>
<p>"Got a ticket? If you haven't, you'll have to stand. Because everything's sold out," the barber warned.</p>

<p>— Mao Yi</p>
<p>Anthropologists have long debated the intellectual superiority between people with long heads and people with round heads. Now, Franz Weidenreich of the American Museum of Natural History, after continuous research, strongly criticizes that both factions of scholars are wasting their time. Dr. Weidenreich presented compelling evidence to overturn the fallacies of the "cephalic index" created a hundred years ago by Swedish anatomist Anders Retzius.</p>
<p>Retzius believed that the superiority of races could be distinguished by measuring skulls. The index created by the ratio between the length of the head (measured from the forehead to the back of the head) and the width of the head was the compass for distinguishing the superiority of races. Since the publication of Retzius' theory, anthropologists have divided all humans into three types: "long-headed," "broad-headed," and "moderate."</p>
<p>Many echoing scientists immediately divided Europeans into two types: "superior" long-headed races—Northern Europe and the Mediterranean coastal peoples. "Inferior" broad-headed or moderate races—Central European peoples. And their emergence was assumed to be the result of interbreeding caused by broad-headed races invading from Asia.</p>
<p>Now, the number of cephalic indices measured by anthropologists is countless, and Dr. Weidenreich feels the evidence is sufficient. The facts he found are: Asians (the prominent Mongolians) who are considered to have "contaminated" the long-headed races of Europe are also long-headed, not round-headed. The only dominant long-headed peoples in the world today are the savage peoples of Australia and Africa. The heads of all people of all civilized races are gradually becoming rounder, probably as a result of the change in human posture from quadrupedal crawling to bipedal standing, because this posture changes the shape of the spine and the base of the skull.</p>
<p>Therefore, the dispute over whether long heads or round heads are superior is meaningless, and all humans are evolving towards "rounder faces."</p>
<h3 id="e190">A Casual Talk about Large Banknotes <a href="#e190" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c190" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">190</a></h3>
<p>— Ruyi</p>
<p>If we now advocate "issuing banknotes with a face value of 100 million yuan," I'm afraid many people would scold us for being ridiculous, right? However, in fact, there are not only single banknotes worth 100 million yuan of our national currency, but also banknotes worth more than 1 billion yuan each!</p>
<p>To put it bluntly, it's actually very simple. What I'm referring to is just a US dollar bill with a face value of $10,000. According to the US dollar benchmark price of the Exchange Stabilization Fund, isn't $10,000 equivalent to $1.195 billion in our national currency?</p>
<p>Of course, very few of these $10,000 US dollar bills circulate outside. In fact, many Americans don't even know that the Federal Reserve has printed such large-denomination banknotes. Most of these banknotes are stored in the vaults of the Federal Reserve, and their main purpose is for the US Treasury to make transfers, but despite "transferring" back and forth, the accounts are different, but those large banknotes often remain untouched in the same place.</p>
<p>However, a few years ago, a major fire suddenly broke out in the vault storing these large banknotes, and as a result, a small portion of the $10,000 banknotes were circulated to the public. Of course, it is quite difficult to exchange such a large-denomination banknote for smaller denominations, so the holders of these large banknotes were willing to devalue them automatically, and were satisfied with exchanging them for only $750.</p>
<p>You may say, "Isn't it too uneconomical to exchange a $10,000 banknote for only $750?" Not so. Even if you can only exchange it for $75, it's still a bargain, because after the fire, the government has declared those $10,000 banknotes circulating outside invalid.</p>
<p>Now, the famous US Federal Bureau of Investigation is heavily guarded. Whenever a $10,000 banknote appears, the holder is immediately summoned and forced to hand over all the $10,000 banknotes in their possession. Therefore, this type of $10,000 banknote has gradually disappeared.</p>
<p>You may even say, "What is $10,000 US dollars?" Well then, the US government not only owns so many of these $10,000 banknotes, but even the banknotes with a face value of $100,000 have already been printed! (You calculate: $100,000 US dollars, according to the official price, should be 11.95 billion yuan in our national currency.) This type of banknote is also exclusively for the use of the US government, but has never been circulated to the public. Therefore, the US dollars circulating outside still have the $10,000 denomination taking the lead.</p>
<p>In addition, $5,000 US dollar banknotes can also be seen, but not many have been issued, with only 2,500 circulating throughout the United States. According to the authorities of the Federal Reserve, the purpose of issuing banknotes with a face value of $5,000 is to "facilitate the public." But the general American public can't figure out how much "convenience" this large denomination can give them, because it is actually very "in"convenient to use. However, the all-knowing Federal Bureau of Investigation found an answer. They said that large denominations of more than $1,000 are actually signals indicating black market transactions. It can simply be said that "wherever there are large banknotes, there are abuses," because they can be hidden to evade income tax, and in case something goes wrong, large banknotes are also easy to "hide up your sleeve." Based on this opinion, the US Treasury Department has issued an order to all banks in the United States that customers who request to exchange large denominations must leave their name and address for future reference.

<p>Ancient people's names had three characters, with rhymes that were the same: Tian Yannian (一先), Gao Aocao (四豪), Liu Youqiu (十一尤). (See Tea 余客话)</p>
<p>Ancient people had three-character style names: In the History of the Northern Dynasties, the twelve sons of Emperor Wen of the Zhou dynasty all had three-character style names, such as Emperor Xiaowu, style name Tuoluoni, and Emperor Wu, style name Miweitu. 湛国札记载 records: Zhang Tianxi, style name Gongchun Jia, Qifu Mumo, style name Anshiba.</p>
<p>Ancient people had "great names that hang in the universe," but little names (including nicknames) are not seen and are special: Cao Cao, nickname Jilin, also known as A'man. (A'man is very familiar, so it is not included, but its character is strange, so it is retained.) Tao Kan, nickname Xigou, Emperor Guangwu of the Han dynasty, nickname Hu. Lin Xiangru's name was Quanzi. Yu Xin's son was named Gou. Fan Weizong's nickname was Brick. Bai Xiangshan's nephew was named , and his daughter was named Luozi. Dongpo's grandson was named Chulao. Ziyou's son Yuan, nickname Hu'er. When Wang Anshi was born, the badger entered the delivery room, nickname Huanlang. Emperor Xiaozong of Song, nickname Yang. Zhu Xi, nickname Shenlang.</p>
<p>Names that are connected, in ancient times, there was Liang Taichang Cheng named Tang Yao, and Han Linwu Chang named Shun. Now there is also a councilor in this city named Chu Shun. Wenzhou has a lawyer named Xia Shang Zhou. As for the lawyer named Bao Ying in Nanjing before the war, it is even more wonderful.</p>
