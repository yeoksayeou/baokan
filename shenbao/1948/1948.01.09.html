<h3>重要出口物資　改進收購辦法　全經會決再付審查</h3>
<p>〔本報南京八日電〕關於重要出口物資繼續收購辦法，應如何改進一案，前經全國經濟委會決定交陳委員啓天等審查後，已提出審査結果，全經會八日下午三時舉行例會時，再度提出討論。審査意見共分七點：（甲）收購原則：　依政府結匯辦法，由商人運銷；　政府對出口物資斟酌收購，但收購不是統購。（乙）收購種類爲桐油，猪鬃，茶葉，大豆，蛋品，生絲六種，羊毛暫不收購。（丙）收購機關仍由中央信託局辦理。（丁）收購價格，由有關各機關組織收購審議委會，價格以顧及生產者利潤爲原則。（戊）收購辦法由中央信託局擬報核備。（己）收購品質：出品物资品質，必須標凖化，由經濟部商品檢驗局嚴格檢査，至如何提高品質，减輕成本，由農部擬具辦法。（庚）出口物資盈　，由國庫負担。會中經討論後，以此事關係鉅大，決定根據上項意見，重付審查，再提會討論。</p>
<h3>補救京滬煤斤不足　經部提五項意見　呈蔣主席核准後實行</h3>
<p>〔本報南京八日電〕為補救京滬煤斤之不足，經濟部正多方設法，經濟部長陳啓天，曾與中央銀行總裁張嘉　等會商，決定提供五項意見，呈請蔣主席核准後實行。該五項意見中，最重要者，爲加强運輸及採購外煤兩端。目前煤斤不足，非由於生產量少，實爲運輸阻滯之故，秦皇島及津浦沿錢均有大批存煤待運。陳等之意見，擬請主席核准，由津浦路專車運輸，並令軍事機關不得加以任何阻碍。採購外煤需用外匯，故亦請主席核准。據悉：滬市每月需煤廿餘萬噸，原定在滬存儲安全煤十萬噸，現僅存有三萬噸，最近且已開始動用，故不徐不急以籌對策，華東鑛存煤近有五萬噸，提前運出，此係由陸軍總部呈請核准者。秦皇島方面，則存有五十萬噸待運，均可用以接濟滬市所需。淮南鑛存煤甚豐，足以接濟首都及京滬沿錢各地。此外，經濟部上海燃管會主任，已奉命赴台，接洽台煤運滬事宜，如以上各項問題獲得解決，京滬　煤即不致再發生困難</p>
<h3>用紙自給白足　三年後可實現</h3>
<p>〔本報南京八日電〕全經會發言人八日稱：目前我向外所訂購之報紙，足敷本年度上傘年之用，在此半年之後，國內紙張增產辦法業已實現，故今後用紙決不致有靑黃不接及匱乏之虞。渠同時宣稱：三年後吾人決可達成自給自足之目的。又我去年度向外購紙計一千八百萬美元，其中紙漿佔百分之十，今年將予以變更，增加紙漿原料，而减少成品之輸入，同時，以紙漿原料配售與各工廠並限定其增產部份，應以百分之五十造報紙。本年度購紙一千四百萬美元即足，其餘將讓與各造紙廠，作爲添製必需器具等。此項意見，業經輸出入委會同意。渠復稱：目前國內所用二萬噸紙，尙係去年第一季之定貨，第二季尙有三分之一紙張未進口，第三季有三分之二以及第四季全部均未進口，故目前報紙來源，實極充裕。</p>
<h3>葉特使由緬抵昆　緬人對劃界誤會巳冰釋　仰光米及木材操於我僑商手中</h3>
<p>〔中央社昆明八日電〕我賀緬獨立特使葉公超一行，今離仰光專機返國，下午一時四十分抵昆。葉特使在機　語本社記者：「緬甸以前對我國尙少認識，此後兩國邦交將益　敦陸。內部方域司傳司長角今前發表關於　緬邊界劃界一文，在緬會引起極大反響，加以共黨之惡意宣傳，使緬甸政府與人民極感不安，甚至謠傳我國軍隊將開入緬者，經本人　加解釋謂，我國緊視緬如兄弟，毫無企圖，始獲釋然。現在緬華僑經濟極穩固，仰光全部米及本材樂均操於僑胞之手。」</p>
<h3>我幣制一旦改革　金鈔黑市可消滅　黃元彬在廣州發表談話</h3>
<p>〔中央社廣州八日電〕全經委會委員黃元彬在穗談稱：「以余個人觀察，美國援華，應以改革幣制借款為第一義。」黃氏請改革幣制後，可採無限制兌換外匯辦法，金鈔黑市自然消減，投機因而根絕。黃氏並認爲改革幣制，可能使一般物價恢復杭戰前水準。照抗戰以來十年之統計，直至去年五月以前，法幣發行數量增加一倍，物價大抵漲至四倍至六倍。去年十月前後法幣發行數量每增加一倍，則物價漲至十倍，蓋截至去年十月底爲止，法幣發行總額約爲廿八萬億元，法幣數量約爲戰前一萬倍而物價漲至十萬倍。是物價高漲之原因，大體言之，法幣數量佔十分之一，所餘十分之九（即物價漲多之九萬倍），全在人民不信法幣。人人從事投機，貨幣流通速度過速所致。所以改革幣制之目的，第一即在解決此九萬倍之物價，因無限制兌換外匯，無可投機，自可恢復抗戰前之貨幣流通速度，而此九萬倍之物價，自必解決，即現在十萬倍之物價，在幣制改革之日，以現行法幣計算，即突降至一萬倍。</p>

<h3>拆屋問題引起　收回香港呼聲</h3>
<p>〔合衆社南京八日電〕此間官方與半官方對香港政府之處理九龍城問題，深感憤懣，某參政員深斥英國之帝國主義。據云，政府官員均一致主張收復香港，然對於如何收回與何時收回之意見則各有不同，某方則主張在此內戰期間香港問題應暫時擱置，冀與英國繼續維持友好之關係，另一方面則主張立即收回香港主權，蓋第一，香港目前爲所有反政府黨派之活動基地，例如李濟琛與非法之民　在該地之活動，第二，香港目前又爲走私要道。然若干觀察家之認為，香港失意政客之活動，不足危害政府，且港府亦已同意防止走私矣。外商則一致感覺在中國內部困難未解決的，不應談收回香港，彼等指出，香港為目前中國唯一經濟社會安定，使商人能安心進行商業之地，香港之貿易，實間接有利於中國者也。</p>

<h3>物價問題如何下藥？</h3>
<p>近來因為物價步漲，民生不安，於是取締囤積居奇，管制日用重要物品的種種呼聲，又隨着停止貸款與停止匯兌等等辦法而高喊出來了。在中央銀行將發萬元以上大鈔之時，為預防物價波動，乃有緊縮信用的卞張，其　以爲只要做些停止什麼等消極辦法，就可阻遏了物價的漲風。詎知停者自停，漲者自漲，幾如風馬牛之不相及。於是大員們的腦筋又轉到了管制與取締上去，他們始終把平衡預算和停止增發通貨的根本辦法，避而不談，只在消極方面做因　廢食的文章，於是登記物資，檢查倉庫這些戰時行之而無效的老法實又要搬出來了。政府則亟亟　議，社會亦紛紛討論，山雨未來而風已滿樓，物價却在這幾天裏「飛黃騰達」的跳起來，似乎有意給人們以　刺！</p>
<p>我們以為平定物價的對症下藥，只有「增加生產，平衡預算」八個大字，其他都是技　。至於說到囤積居奇，根本先要弄淸幾點觀念：</p>
<p>第一，所謂囤積居寄，與正當的存貨，就有分別。例如工廠積存原料·燃料·乃至製品，或商號以其正當的資力儲存本業貨品，這在形式上，雖似為囤積但却是投資性質，不是投機性質，實與囤積居廳不同，未可等量齊觀。倘必須左手進來，右手出去，致使存底枯竭，無可挹注，這於整個的國民經濟上究有何益？</p>
<p>第二，上海本是百貨集散的樞紐，亦是生產事業的中心。各種物資正當的存底，不單是本市工商業命脈之所繫，而實是內地各埠取給之所從。在努力消滅囤風之時，應如何兼籌並顧，不致使正當商人視存貨為畏途而羣趨於投機之路，因而危及工商業的元氣。</p>
<p>第三，囤積應無辜而居奇方有罪。因為在物資缺之的當兒，如果沒有從前一些存貨，則一到緩不濟急的時候，民生必需反　要受到威脅了。所以有囤積，充其量不過是物價的高下問題，而禁絕了囤積，恐將　成物資的有無問題。在抗戰八年中，大後方工業不致停頓，民生日用品所需不致匱乏，一部分或者還是靠囤積存貨的力量吧。故囤積不能即認爲妨害國計民生，而居奇以圖暴利始爲社會所不容。</p>
<p>第四，大家一提囤積，就責駡奸商，尤其　駡上海的奸商，其實這也是皮相之論。須知目前所盛行的囤積，不在正式的商人，而在游資沒有出路的散戶。散戶徧於全中國，而決不限於上海。散戶所以要囤積貨物，也決不是存着居奇的心理，而是爲了保陣他們手中法幣的價値。以前，中央銀行六百萬盎斯的黃金，就是在這樣的心理下，變了戒子套在娘姨大姐黃包車夫的指上的。及至黃金無可購買，於是在鄕村的農產品，在都市的製成品，都成爲散戶囤積的對象了。因此，儘管停止貸款，停止匯款到上海，而物價依然　漲，內地的物價且先漲過於上海。在今日而言囤積，幾乎滔滔者天下皆是也！誰爲爲之？執令致之？</p>
<p>我們先弄明白了這幾點似乎平淡而實屬切要的觀念，然後來佔量主持經濟政策的大員們今後的策略是否能對症下藥。可惜他們還不肯承認這是法幣貶值和物資缺乏在作祟，却祗把一切的罪惡歸到囤積居奇的「奸商」身上，於是久已失了效用的「非常時期取締日用重要物品囤積居奇辦法」又重新視爲至寳了。這樣一來，所有的物品都要登記，登記以後就要檢査，檢査到了稍不符合的嫌疑，就可沒收充公，商人就要坐牢吃官司。充此種恐慌心理之所至，倉庫可一掃而空，商人將被迫停止交易，貨物不再補充，原料漸吿斷絕，工廠祗得停工，有錢也買不到日用必需品，社會秩序於是難以維持。一旦後果如此，何堪設想？政府大員，憂國憂民，以爲現在民生弄到如此地步，都是奸商在着作崇，為了大多數人民的利益着想，祗有犧牲少數奸商，才可國泰民安。但不知他們有沒有想到上面所述的種種頗　？萬一我們所顧　的不幸　言中，則在剿匪戡亂的期間，豈非將　親者痛而仇者快　？</p>
<p>本問題　結所在，旣是　幣貶値為一主國，我們就應從這方面對症下藥，使之穩定。我們要取締囤積居奇，根本就要使得囤積者無奇可居。因此，我們可作如下的建議：</p>
<p>穩定法幣，平衡預算，並不是絕對沒有辦法的，最低的限度就目前情况中穩定下來，應該可以做得到。如果政府認眞把各種稅收整頓起來，使之過適歸公，各種　枝機關一律裁併起來，使得沒有浪費，不必要的支出暫時剔除起來，使得國庫負擔减輕，接收的敵偽產業和外來的接濟物資儘速變賣出來，使得法幣回籠，則雖有龐大的軍費支出，究可相當阻止發行的增加。何况美國借款的援助呼聲甚高，穩定法幣實是不容再事猶　。預算平衡，法幣穩定了以後，物價也就穩定了，人心無所恐懼，囤積也就不攻自破。這是釜底抽薪的治木的辦法，我　以爲比較登記檢查這些消極辦法當然要有效多多了。</p>
<p>充實物資也是容易做得到的。除了改變「停止」政策，盡其全力以扶助農工業增加生產而外，許多物資已掌握在政府手中者，祗要政府把分配辦得認眞一些，至少限度的民生日用必需品是可以供給的。民生所最需要的爲糧食，糧食部田賦征實所得的應該可以調劑民食，何况更有外來援助的糧食？餘如食油，中國植物汕料廠應可供應；如紗布，政府早已掌握了百分之七十，也可能負其責任；如燃料，旣有燃料管理委員會對於煤的統籌，更有中國石汕公司對於石油的配給，祗要主管各部門能够從「增加生產，開關來源」的積極方面着手，不專以營利爲其消極的目標，預料日用必需品類可能充斥於市。供應品一多，囤積者無可居奇，也就何必囤積？這是正本淸源的有效辦法，又非僅憑登記檢查所能奏效的。</p>
<p>政府大更對於上述建議，如果日爲老生常談，而祗視「非常時期取締日用重耍物品囤積居奇辦法」爲還可一用的唯一法寶，則我們願於明天再申論該項辦法窒碍難行之故，以就正於高明。</p>

<h3>馬歇爾向參議院攤牌　呼籲通過援歐案　西歐危急不能坐視不救</h3>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓八日電〕馬歇爾今日出席美參院外　委員會報告其援歐計劃，在馬歇爾報告前，該委員會主席范登堡先綜述馬歇爾計劃之大綱。</p>
<p>〔路透社華盛頓八日電〕馬歇爾國務卿八日率直吿參院外交委員會，若國會之共和黨議員，竟然實行其恐嚇而削减歐洲復興計劃下美國供給之援助額，則不如放棄此一計劃。當前問題，乃應付該計劃之需要或根本不實行該計劃，不黨的計劃徒然浪費美國資源不能有有效的結果。馬卿復日：吾人所知之生活方式，已在垂危之中，新大陸從事此一空前的努力以援助舊大陸殊非簡易，亦無把握，此乃有計算的冒險，吾人目前所能言者，即該一計劃具有獲得成功之方法，然本人相信吾人如保持成功的意志，則成就必能獲得。馬卿繼復强調下列諸點：　援助計劃至遲於本年四月一日即須開始實行，否則，該整個計劃所基之若千基木條件，將起彎化。　最初十五個月內估計需要之六十億元，乃絕對的最低限度需要，實施歐洲復興計劃四年有半之全期內，美國負担之援助額在一百五十億至一百七十億元之間。　美國雖供給援助，但決不能干涉歐洲國家之外交政策或附帶足以破壞歐洲合作制度的條件。　援助方案若不獲國會通過或不幸而遭遇失敗，則美國之國家安全將受威脅，事實上不帝置身武裝陣營之內。　渠堅決拒絕共和黨主張另設與國務院獨立之機構，以管理援歐方案之建議。力言在美國決不能同時有兩個國務卿。　渠指出蘇聯及共產黨懷具破壞歐洲復興計劃之決心，因此將使該方案之實施更趨困難。馬歇爾於開始陳述意見之初，即强調聲明，如果歐洲之健全經濟不獲恢復，則美國人民以及世界各地自由人民爲其本身及其子孫覓取和平公理安全及福利的希望，將蒙最重損書。在飢饉貧窮，困苦及因此所引起的混亂，威脅西歐二萬萬七千萬人民的期間，每一方面的社會水準以及政治狀態，將賡續的急遽惡化，坐視不救，將使彼等不能逃避經濟破產社會不靖及普遍而猛烈的政治衝突，卒使西方文明的歷史基地，趨於崩潰。吾人所嘗奮戰而加以毀滅的專墴勢力，事實上似尙未遭毁滅，在西歐所造成的眞空，恐終不免爲戰爭之源的勢力所塡補。</p>
<h3>馬歇爾態度堅決　如計劃遭變更不惜辭職　援歐案有迅速通過希望</h3>
<p>〔路透社華盛頓八日電〕馬歇爾國務卿在參院外委會中向共和黨關於歐洲復興計劃之批評所發動之强力反攻，使人重新發生國會可望迅速通過該案的希望，由於本年之爲選舉年，以及馬歇爾本人在與論界的勢力，渠之言論，實具有重大的力量。</p>
<p>國會議員中願意反對此一擁有兩黨支持實力僅次於羅斯福總統之人物者僅佔少數。加之馬歇爾本人從未以染指總統競選爲號召，決不致被人指爲玩弄政治，因此國人給予馬歇爾之支持更見有效。在馬卿出席參院外委會陳辭前之二十四小時，當渠先於杜魯門總統步入國會，聆取杜魯門發表其國情咨文之際，兩院兩黨議員對渠有熱烈的鼓掌，今日渠在參院外委會中之陳辭，充分表現其坦白堅決的美國精神，令人憶及渠在戰時襄助羅斯福總統之勳蹟。共和黨領袖，在原則上並不反對馬歇爾之援助方案，但企圖削减援助數額，然馬歇爾已表示援助數額如被削减，將成一無用的救濟計劃，不復爲一復興計劃。觀察家僉信，如果國會拒絕給予適當的管理方案　限或適當的援助資金，馬歇爾不惜辭職而去，不願爲未具適當配備的船舶之駕駛。渠在參院外委會中聲明美國中不能有兩個國務卿，不啻暗示不惜辭職之意，一九四八年乃參院三分之一之議員及衆議院全部議員之改選年，預料必無一個議員願冒逐去最得人心的國務卿之大不韙。</p>
<h3>范登堡塔虎脫　援歐意見分歧</h3>
<p>共和黨發現分裂象徵</p>
<p>〔路透社華盛頓八日電〕參院外交委員會，已於八日起開始就馬歇爾援歐計劃作聆取意見之審査，共和黨內部對馬歇爾方案之意見，已發見分裂之象徵。共和黨內部意見之分歧，因共和黨兩領導人物參議員塔虎脫及范登堡　論相反而益趨明　。范登堡對馬　爾方案深為信任，並眞正企圖以兩黨基礎爲該方案而奮鬥，而塔虎脫則已公然表示主張减少援助總額，並預料國會就該案之辯論，至早在七月一日以前難　結束。塔虎脫與范登堡兩人均有强大之後盾，故兩人意見之不相容，可能引起共和黨內部之分裂。</p>
<h3>杜魯門對國會演說　會塲反應極冷淡　共和黨議員報以譏誚聲</h3>
<p>〔路透社華盛頓七日電〕杜魯門總統今日在國會宣讀其一年一度之國情咨文時，會塲反應，至爲冷淡，僅總統進入會塲及退出會塲時，塲內會鼓掌歡迎，此外僅於述及共和黨建議之反工會法及重申其普遍軍訓之呼籲時，會塲曾有稀疏之掌聲。據觀察家稱，此盜由於兩院之共和黨多數議員，對杜魯門之建議均具反感之故。預料渠之呼籲兩黨人士為國家利益計，於今年選舉之年，放棄黨見，必無予以響應者。</p>
<p>〔路透社華盛頓七日電〕衆院共和黨領袖哈萊克評杜魯門總統之咨文，稱之為充滿煽動性之言辭，若予批准將使政府增加無數億元之支出，此不類出諸總統之口，而若出諸一候選總統之口。衆院撥款委會主席泰勃，認總統所提之賦稅計劃，將損害生產，乃反動的建議。衆院議長馬丁指杜魯門欲激起其沉沒的政治地位而巳。</p>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓七日電〕在今日向國會提出之聯邦狀况報吿中，杜魯門總統並未强調世界不安之現狀，實出人意料之外者。然渠强調美國之國防必須堅强，此後總統建議裁减收入較少之公民，之捐稅，共和黨議員對總統之報告頗表反感，總統報告時彼等時時發出議誚聲。</p>
<h3>華萊士評語　認爲舊重彈</h3>
<p>〔合衆社紐約八日電）美國總統競選人華萊士八日稱，杜魯門總統之聯邦咨文「舊調重彈」，無殊於一九四六年渠提出之目的。如一九五八年渠仍為總統，其目的恐亦將一成不變，　屆時不致有進步可言也。然杜氏仍要求修改塔虎特·赫德利勞工法案，渠提出法案之能通過者恐祗有强迫軍役法案。</p>
<h3>瑞士方面盛傳　史達林病死說</h3>
<p>〔路透社瑞土京城八日電〕此問盛傳史達林元帥已死，然均缺乏根據。瑞士民主社會黨之伯爾尼日報謂，史邇林已死說，在瑞士之俄人均不能加以否絕，過去於傳出此等謠言時，均立即有否認之聲明，此次則雖有謠言，旣不能予以證實，亦未能獲有否認。</p>

<p>〔中央社東京八日電〕據東京民報今　稱，左冀社會黨領袖松本治一鍾頃勸吿片山哲內　辭職。渠對內閣之公開批評，爲社民黨內部裂痕日見擴大之象徵，可能預示內閣之早日垮台。</p>

<p>〔中央社東京八日電〕頃獲悉，日外務省將於近數月內設立一項新國際組織局，俾便凖備和約簽定後日本與聯合國產生關係後之種種工作。</p>
<h3>巴西通過法案　排除共黨議員</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕倫敦八日廣播：巴西京城訊，巴西衆院於早期三晚投票通過取消共黨在全國各地被選舉地位。此項辦法業已先經參院通過，刻巳由總統簽字，至此共黨在巴西已完全失却合法活動之地位矣。在開會期間，議員薛爾伐拔出手槍，擬向共黨議員格　哥里亞射擊，但未開火，會議曾暫停片刻以防不測。</p>
<h3>摩洛哥領袖倡導　北非獨立運動</h3>
<p>〔聯合社法屬北非突尼斯七日電〕摩洛哥年過土著反法領袖阿白特爾克林，在開羅宣布組織「北非獨立委員會」，此間認為國際又增一糾紛，足以展開美蘇衝突之新塲所。法國正忙於應付越南與馬　加斯加島武裝獨立運動，現必更感棘手。</p>

<p>〔英國新聞處倫敦八日電〕英財相克利浦斯今日在記者招待會上，發表一九四八年之英國經濟計劃。渠稱，今年度兩大目標為賺得更多美元及進一步促使海外貿易平衡。設若英國今年所賺美元達到其目標之百分之五十，而英國在全年所缺美元之數仍達三億鎊。</p>
<p>克氏述及世界物價提高所引起之困難稱，「即使將進口貨數量價均在上升也。」克氏最後述及馬歇爾計劃之聲明稱，在美元方面，英國勢必處於嚴重地位，除非此項計劃即見實行，英國如無美元則未能從西半球獲致糧食及原料之进口货，則吾人亦不能輸出煤斤，鋼鐵及其他重要貨物至西歐各國。苟吾人美元缺乏困難未能獲得協助，吾人則無法參與歐洲復興，因此吾人亦無法參與全世界之復興，吾人唯有回複急求自力更生之政策。</p>
<h3>國際間大騙子　「中國陸軍上將」　王芝客大吹法螺</h3>
<p>— 本報駐日記者　陳洛</p>
<p>去年初春，日本各地若狂的出現了揭發軍閥們剩下的五百億圓隱匿物資之「淘金熱」時代，常時在隱匿棉布首屈一指的京都地方，是日本全國棉布買辦經紀等滿纏紙幣如蟻附羶的地帶。各派明爭暗鬥，活躍非凡，轟動整個社會，就在這一陣旋風中，突然躍出了一位「中國陸軍上將王芝客！」</p>
<p>如此將軍</p>
<p>王上將據說是青帮中的一位數一數二人物，曾任和平同盟軍參議。只要他的命令一下，那在上海附近駐紮的一百五十萬的和平同盟軍便隨時出動。他在上海開了一家「中南輪船運輸公司」，共有船舶三十五艘。王的日本名字是大塚博國，同時又據說他是純粹的中國人，亦有說他是中日混血兒，究不知孰眞孰假。</p>
<p>當時王將軍的親信兼參謀人物中，計有風糜一時的」東海海盜」江運力一郞，及關東軍憲兵上尉之中島雪之助兩人，他們向各處散播說：「王上將對於運向中國的貨物，一手包辦，又負擔着與駐日中國代表團當局商量賠償物資各種事項之責，並有將該項物資之一部份轉用於日本國內之權力。」</p>
<p>日人開此消息，紛紛捷足登門。其中有渾名「禿鶴」之前任日本警視總監丸出鶴吉，立刻派丸竹物產公司總經理渡邊前往京都覲見王將軍，丸竹物產公司是丸山鶴吉與舊日警視應秘書渡邊竹二郞共營事業，設公司於東京，表面上經售農村用家其農具，其實是專幹黑市與統制之軍服棉布等生意。渡邊氏一見王將軍的風度，已不由自主的感佩至極，王將軍的禿頭，比起自己主人「禿鶴」還要禿，而且短小精悍，腹大便便，無論從什麽地方來看，這位王將軍確是中國第一流大人物。</p>
<p>發財之夢</p>
<p>此時，京都的富商若王子知史到東京往訪東邦商事的加藤重六氏云：「王將軍所承辦的運往中國的布疋，擬加工製造後起運，由此國內縫紉，業將大受裨益」。加藤是前時事新報記者，而今正時運不佳，今得到這樣好機會，如何不想往京都去發財。</p>
<p>王將軍悠然啣着雪茄俯視加藤，笑着表示他決定向代表團說一聲，將三井倉庫的二萬疋布都賣給加藤。</p>
<p>加藤氏回家之後，立刻準備現金一千萬元（約合美金十萬元），以備購進該項布疋，但當時他並未將款項直接交與王將軍。又有名瀧澤光男者，亦因同樣事情曾將八百萬元交與王將軍親信人，據云在三月廿七日必能在三井倉庫中將洋布搬出，但是時日已過，延不出貨，乃發覺有異·於是往求中島，但中島說：「不要性急」。搪塞了事。</p>
<p>疑竇初開</p>
<p>六月十五日黃昏，大阪金子產業社長往訪加藤，謂以前曾由若王子介紹，與王將軍見面，被其利用「駐日中國特務機關」名義，取去五萬圓等語，並認爲王將軍殊屬可疑云云。加藤因預備買貨而借來一千萬圓之利息及旅館費等，早已用去數十萬圓，於是星夜奔至江連住所，賀詢此事，結果終不得要領，於是往下鴨警察署査問。據警察當局說：「你問王將軍嗎？他老人家是中國當代的貴族，並且是蔣生席的結拜兄弟，在戰爭中，因設法運鹽到中國一事，大為蔣主席嘉許哩！」</p>
<p>運鹽事件</p>
<p>說到運鹽不由提醒了加藤，那是十幾年前的事了。在昭和八年，（民國廿二年）大阪轟動一時的財翁島德藏遭受了「運鹽事件」的惡運。這事件背後，有一位呌大塚久三的人。大塚是京都生長的日本人，十七歲渡華，在東北的火車上充當茶房，因此有機會接觸紳商名士，其後遂專在日本與東北兩地來往招搖撞騙。九一八事件發生後不久，大塚謂島德藏云：「現取得特許，可以運鹽往中國」，得島德藏墊出二百萬圓，裝好鹽斤，預備由神戶啓碇，旋即被大阪憲兵隊所拘，當時因尙未有「利敵行爲」之明文，所以島及大塚兩人，經一個月之審訊　押後即行釋放，但島則因此而致破產，當時探訪此事最詳細者，即爲現下之前時事新報記者加藤，因此加藤隨即聯想起現在之王大將，就是以前之稀世欺騙專家大塚久三。</p>
<p>十七日，王將軍突被京都某機關拘傳，搜查住宅，截獲名貴雪茄及配尼西林等，計時値約七十萬元，至於問題焦點之委任狀及其他文件，則早已被大塚之女兒郁子先行火化滅跡</p>
<p>判服勞役</p>
<p>大塚先　押警察署，頃巳由京都軍事法庭判處服勞役五年，並罰款七千五百日元。</p>
<p>最後，記者要補提一筆：川島芳子之金蘭姊妹德枝，（五十一歲），本係大塚元配妻室，因與大塚離異將近十年，對此事件全無關係。而國際的大騙子「中國陸軍上將」王芝客在鐵窗之下撫今追昔，正不知作何感想耳！</p>

<h3>地院增闢法庭　引起內部糾紛</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕地院自奉令增設民刑庭，將推事調升庭長以來，其他推事頗表不滿，近來內部糾紛有擴大趨勢。民刑庭推事共三十二人聯名，由吳紹昌推事領銜，昨日分別具呈高院院長郭雲勸與地院院長查良鑑，原呈略謂：「竊查本院長刑案件素稱繁多，人員頗嫌未足，以致案件積壓，久爲社會所不滿，近奉司法行政部令增設民庭二，刑庭三，並准本院保　原任推事之黃光鈺，鍾顯達，沈天保，朱育璜，施琮等五員充任庭長，冀以改進本院事務，用意良善，惟以此項措施尙有未到之處，職等以身親其事，不得已於　者，謹爲鈞長陳之：　此次增派庭長，全部係就原任推事者調充，旣非自外遴選血來，而院中推事又未另派，故全院推事人數，實際並無增加，而依諸法院慣例，庭長承辦案件較普通推事爲少，其結果此次增置庭長，即無異於减少辦案八員，似此而欲增強辦案效率，其何可得，部中原意似在减少積案，結果恐反增加積案矣。　按法院組織之規定，庭長之任務係在「監督各該庭事務並由其分配」，且爲合議庭之審判者，而其爲審判長之任務，實遠較行政方面之任務　重大，又依同法第四條第一項之規定：「合議審判以庭長充審判長，無　長　　長有事故時，以庭員中資深者充任之，」依此解釋，為審判長之庭長，實應為全庭中資歷最深之人，本院此次新派之庭長五人中，其資深者固不乏人，而任推事迄今尚朱滿三年，在全院推事中資歷極淺者，亦竟有之。似此情形，不僅不足以符法意而昭愼重，適足啓外人輕視之念，實非合理之舉也。」（下略）</p>
<h3>小野心家鋃鐺入獄　供稱有領袖慾　妄想組行動隊</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕十六歲少年金寳山，紹興人，化名葉益頤，曾在格致中學讀書，忽於去年自稱行動總隊大隊長，並私刻關防，私發派令，去年九月廿六日委同學周培榮爲中隊長，並託周招集同學四十五人爲幹部，每人收保證金三十萬元，周因偶與警察派出所閒談，事遂洩露，警局恐金有政治作用，遂將金逮捕，移送法院査辦。昨日地院鍾顯達推事開庭審理，金供稱：因平素有領袖慾，加之受電影與連環岡書影響，遂想組織行動總隊，自充領袖，完全係「白相相」性質，並無任何政治作用。審畢，鍾推事當庭判處金徒刑四月，關防派令沒收，此一小野心家，於是银鐺入獄。</p>

<h3>瀋陽炮聲緊密　共匪「七次攻勢」有轉襲錦州企圖</h3>
<p>〔本報瀋陽三日航訊〕厚雪堅冰覆壓下的東北，襲來了東北共匪的「七次攻勢」。據說共匪謂此次攻勢爲「新一次」，就在這凍結時期，有如狂飆捲起了風砂，工礦，交通，財產，生命，在戰火和嚴寒控制下，消沉，窒息。這次</p>
<p>戰事的開端</p>
<p>是十二月十二日，共匪李運昌部，破壞北寗路錦州和溝帮子間大凌河鐵橋，並攻襲那一段的幾個車站，把甫經恢復的平瀋通車，弄得僅僅從瀋陽開出了三列，從北平到達瀋陽了兩列，以後由分段通車而至不能通車。</p>
<p>遼北匪第一·二·三·六·十等縱隊，從平梅路上的西安和西豐等地，越過中長路，向遼河北岸的法庫周園集結，從西北指向瀋陽，遼南匪第四縱隊，從東南方面沿「遼工」和「潘安」鐵路，分兩股趨向遼陽和蘇家屯，企岡從南方成脅潘陽。這次匪採取滲透鐀隙戰術，求取</p>
<p>核心—瀋陽</p>
<p>此外還有兩個目的：一個是使開原孤立，吃掉開原守軍周福成部隊，另一個是打擊在瀋陽西北地區的廖耀湘丘團。</p>
<p>但，匪第二縱隊第六師，首先在法庫東南十五公里地方，一個呌着沙後所的村子，吃了一個大虧，被廖兵團吃掉了，而開原的周福成部隊，接着又得能衝破匪的包圍和封鎖，做戰略上的轉進，大部撤離開原，轉而保衛鐵嶺和潘陽。</p>
<p>這時，匪在鐵嶺以西，新民以東，法庫以南地區，不斷與國軍接觸，並以一部兵力，沿法庫到瀋陽的公路，越過封結了的遼河，攻襲南岸要隘石佛寺，先頭部隊更繞越南進。</p>
<p>匪方的計劃</p>
<p>是：打下了瀋陽西北角的彰武和西面的新立屯，再來攻略核心，所以拿着第七縱隊，猛攻彰武，第八縱隊圍攻新立屯，好無後顧之憂。</p>
<p>國軍對於這兩個據點，從事堅守，以延壓匪之求取核心計劃，到了廿八日晚彰武方面，終因匪方的砲火猛烈，被匪攻陷，匪遂加緊了對於瀋陽的壓力。</p>
<p>廿七·廿八·那兩天，北路匪三·六兩縱隊的主力，接近了潘陽西面郊區，南路的匪的第四縱隊，除了留下一部擾亂遼陽北「十里河」和「沙河」以及瀋陽南「蘇家屯」外，大部西竄，到達了北寗路綫新民以東地區，企圖和北路匪會師，攻襲瀋腸。</p>
<p>廿八日那天，太陽下了山，匪開始以</p>
<p>迫擊砲轟擊</p>
<p>瀋陽市西郊「于洪區」，並有砲彈落到了「鐵西區」，同時匪一小股到達了「于洪區」，國軍槍砲齊發，半夜的戰鬥，匪被打退了，這是匪第一次做試探性攻擊市區的行動。</p>
<p>這時，瀋陽顯得有些緊張了，西，北和南三個郊區的農民，頗多車載馬䭾婦孺什物，進城避難，瀋陽的食糧和日用品，也在加倍的飛漲。貧民搶糧，也在這時期發生，結果，終於相繼的平息下來。</p>
<p>接近瀋陽西郊的匪軍，只能繼續</p>
<p>攻擊和竄擾</p>
<p>同時並逐漸的後退，遠離，原因有三：第一是瀋陽有備，試攻碰壁，第二個是空軍在廿九日大批出動，使後續部隊和彈藥，在大雪載途中難於增援。</p>
<p>另外一個原因，是國軍在瀋陽西北卅五公里的一個村落「萬金台」，打了一個戰略上的大仗，那是一個房屋零散，地形複雜的村落，是利於進攻，難於防守的，而守在那裏的國軍又是個原先是靑年軍二零七師的番號，現在是換上了東北靑年新兵的隊伍。廿七日晚，</p>
<p>匪第六縱隊</p>
<p>攻「萬金台」，四個月的新兵，初次作戰，頗稱得手，一夜的激戰，俘匪百餘，獲戰利品更多，匪吃　後，廿八日夜，以砲火猛轟，房舍，軍民，毀傷慘烈，匪並以「爆炸英雄」負炸藥爬行爆炸，到了廿九日，國軍彈盡援絕，一千二百多人的兩個營兵力，除了少數傷兵於匪退後由屍堆中逃出外，是完全犧牲了。團長蔡嶽陣亡，營長胡秀峰戰死，又營長李秀固負重傷後，下落不明。牆倒了，屋塌了，不能走的村民，差不多不是死，就是傷，牆外屋旁，匪屍更多。</p>
<p>由於這一場慘烈的戰鬥，換得了破碎匪方這次企岡使瀋陽充分嚐受</p>
<p>砲火的計畫</p>
<p>同時又不得不放棄第一計劃，實行次一步驟的攻略錦州。</p>
<p>卅六年的除夕，瀋陽解圍了，瀋陽西北地區集結的匪衆，大部轉向大虎山錦州問。卅七年的開頭，差不多算是共匪七次攻勢的尾聲，錦州或將是尾聲的受難者！（特派員韓淸濤）</p>

<p>委託紡建公司購棉之合同，業於前日與該公司正式簽訂。收購資金，亦已全部撥出。又袁氏為委託紡建收棉事，昨特發表書面談話如次：</p>
<p>關於政府收購棉花，本人曾一再聲明，絕不妨碍棉商之地位與利益，最近因時機緊迫，須向各地產區設法搶購國棉，故暫委託中紡代辦，以期事　集中，較易管理，且絕不影響原有棉商之營業。蓋棉商儘可自向中紡接洽收購，其情形正與各別售與本會，毫無差異。昨日報載各棉商開會爭議各點，堪謂完全誤解。至於收購價格，依照目前價辦理，實為最公充之方法，市價之外，尙安有更合理之價格。至望本市全體棉商，勿遇事誤解，意氣用事云。</p>
<h3>人造絲狂漲</h3>
<p>人造絲漲風再接再厲，昨市行情造成新紀錄。一二〇號旭字有光，上午開盤即抬高至二千萬元，午收盤即期價二千一百萬元，隔日期三百五十萬元有成交。下午更形瘋狂，最大價高達三千五百萬元，不乏乘高脫手，乃稍回退。最後成交價爲二千七百萬元，買出價喊九百萬元，比上日漲起一千七百萬元。</p>
<h3>金菜飛升</h3>
<p>金針菜以到存不多，鎭地產價一再高升，此間行盤亦扶搖直上，前後升度達三成以上，高貨已近七關，次不一。</p>

<h3>病根</h3>
<p>— 伯永</p>
<p>讓文學雜誌二卷六期朱光潛先生「蘇格拉底在中國」一文，見出學者與一般皮相的觀察家畢竟不同。這篇「對話」中的蘇格拉底，自然就是朱氏夫子自道，朱氏本是唯心傾向頗重的人，受了克羅齊派行式美學的影響，專請從心理及哲學方面解決問題，「文藝心理學」即其代表作。</p>
<p>文中把中國近代政治不上軌道，人民苦難，歸格結蒂於沒有成系統的哲學，形而上學，如古代希臘之於歐美。因之，中國人的思想只是零零碎碎的個人主義，沒有一貫的理論使他走上團體主義及奮鬥的路上去。這些話，實在是言之成理，持之有故，頗有道着中國人的毛病處。</p>
<p>然而若說中國的一切失敗源於沒有哲學，那是我無論如何不敢相信的。所謂東方精神文明，連洋鬼子哲學家叔本華尼釆都爲之心折的是什麼？不是我們老祖宗的「形而上之謂道嗎」？自先秦諸子迄宋元明理學，那1點那一人不是形而上的？朱氏曰：這雖是哲學，然而不像歐洲那麽有系統，是經過一番思考而後安排的，我們誠然沒對歐洲希臘哲學有十分透　的硏究，然而若說中國的各派思想都沒有系統，却也不敢相信。近代入所編的學術史哲學史之類，分明把先秦諸子的思想都列得整整齊齊，什麽本體論，人性論，政論，道德論，……只要我們費點心思整理一番，大約也不難各有端緒的。何况如墨子等，其著述本身就很有系統呢。反之，西洋許多哲學，也有的是根據了對話語錄整理出來，而不是一下子作成功的。</p>
<p>依我的意思，與其說中國沒有哲學還不如說哲學太多！十五年前，當中國本位文化建設正在高唱之際，就有人主張「全盤西化」，因而有許多人反對，其實全盤西化這句話是有些語病，不如改爲近代化亦即科學化。西洋人生最大的改變不在其古代　學，而在工業革命以後的生產方式發生根本變化，若是沒有發明機器，我們敢斷言蘇格拉底伯拉圖都打不垮中國，中國還可以閉起大門作皇帝，稱孤道寡。有人懷疑爲什麽中國的社會經濟長期停滯在手工生產上，其實歐洲的手工生產階段何嘗不長？中國較落後的不過二百年耳，唯科學與哲學不同，哲學歷久而不變，科學在日新月異，一千幾百年的老社會，一經瓦特，牛頓，愛迪生，諾貝爾，　因斯坦的洗禮，就有了突變，而且天天在變，時時在變，差一步已竟趕不及，差二百年就更加不行了。</p>
<p>迷信科學也許有毛病，例如戰爭及美國式的文化沒有深度皆是，然而這是人類沒有好好利用他的原故，猶之乎火可以駛車行船，亦可把高樓大廈夷爲平地。因　廢食，總是不正當的。一個國家能侵略別人，至少證明他太身有過剿的精力，不像我們的後天失調。秦漢時代，中國何嘗沒有這樣的光榮，那其實也不是中國用文化征服別人，而是對戰爭工具及方法有了改善，才會制勝，等到勝利以後，我們的文化自會跟着過去，而那種蓄積的力量，是由於中國已經走上農業生產之路，在財富勢力上遠勝匈奴西城。所以一到大亂之後，人民被暴政剝削得無力生產，必致國力大衰，如宋明皆是。談　學的總喜歡　這些事神而明之，其實是簡單之至。如果中國在十七世紀也有瓦特，十九世紀有愛迪生，二十世紀有愛因斯坦和馬可尼居禮，我們可以保證不是今日這個樣子，外面的侵略也就不至於把我們　得落花流水，倉　震，衣食足，貪污不法，都不成問題，今日的貪汚分于，沒一個不明白法律，也沒有一個不明白「皮之不存毛將焉附」的道理。所以仍要如此者，窮而已矣。</p>
<p>希臘是哲學的祖國，可是希臘今日亂作一國，貪汚的也不少。這就足够說明哲學之無補。美國南北戰爭時，人民陷於困苦，也有貪污之風，可是生活一改善，馬上完結。我們這個時候好像沒有那麽多餘　講蘇格拉底康德，還是設法生產糧食，恢復交通，改善生活要緊。</p>
<h3>骨肉之情</h3>
<p>— 靜文</p>
<p>不久以前，冬令救濟會的庇寒所用了幾輛大卡車，在各地搜羅難胞，但據報載的情形，很多難胞都不肯進庇寒所，甚至被强迫捉了進去，還想乘人不備逃出來，於是庇寒所似乎不成其爲慈善機關，反倒有三分像集中營了，有飯可以吃飽，有衣可以穿暖，有屋子住，有工作做，不要你一個錢，這種便宜地方，到那兒去找？「安得廣處千萬問，大庇天下塞士盡歡顏。」如今有了廣處，而寒士們却不肯「屈」就起來，甘願露宿行頭，蓬首跣足，忍飢挨餓，受風雪的洗禮，倒偵使人大惑不解了。</p>
<p>但是實際情形又恰相反，街頭的流浪者們並非天生賤骨，大批的難民被砲火所迫，流遷上海，並不都是單身漢，妻兒父母，老老少少，也歷盡辛苦，一回逃荒，如今有力氣做活的或是年紀幼小的幸運被送進了庇寒所，丟下一家子父母兄弟，妻子兒女，豈不更難渡光陰？骨肉情深，縱然一人的肚子不餓，一人的身體不冷，坐視自己孩子無怙無恃，凍餒交迫，自己父母衣食不周，走向死亡，又怎有這樣心腸在庇寒所裏安居下去！</p>
<p>「涸轍之　，相濡以沫，」只有窮人才知窮人的苦處。患難相茲，原是人類無上的美德，也就是人類至愛至情的表現。只是湮沒了人性的像人動物，在他們的眼裏看來，這批不識抬舉的難胞，現成享福還不廿願，可眞是天空第一號的大傻瓜了。</p>
<h3>浪淘沙</h3>
<p>— 顧飛</p>
<p>文鳳又有美洲之行　霜月轉窓寒，酒醒燈闌，短長亭外萬重山…握手風前千種語，忘了加餐。　望遠倚　欄，　葉斑斑，彩雲有　好飛還。莫進人生離別易，會又何難！</p>
<h3>說話的藝術</h3>
<p>— 靖文</p>
<p>俗話說「病從口入，禍從口出」，前一句是科學談，後一句是經驗談；病雖不一定從口入，但禍從口出卻是至　名言，往往在你是漫不經心之談，而在無意中卻開罪了別人。大丈夫一言可以興邦，卻也可以喪邦，舊小說上常有「大丈夫一言既出駟馬難追」之語，更說明了一個人說話的重要。就是在所謂「白相人地界」，也頗重視「放一句　話」過來的說法，因為雖然十「一句　話」，意思九十要你「　隻肩架」負責任也。</p>
<p>會說會話的人，總是到處多佔一些便宜的。譬如在路上看見兩個人吵架，那個指手劃脚的人總是最後博得旁觀者的同情，而另一個面紅耳赤訥訥其詞的人，雖有滿肚子的道理，却難吸引觀衆的注意。</p>
<p>不過會說會話不一定就算懂得了說話的藝術。因爲，會說會話，有時反不免招人輕薄之議，尤其在大庭廣衆之問，說多了無聊話往往會把自己弄成是一個小丑脚色。而且「禍從口出」，也就是多言招來的是非。</p>
<p>懂得說話藝術的人，雖不一定會說會話，但一言一語，總能適如其份。言語原是達意的媒介，若是詞不達意，縱使你能善言巧辯，終不能取得別人的重視。所以說話　術的要諦，主要是在語詞適當。而語詞適當，則又有關於個人的修養與經驗。</p>
<p>最難說話的塲所當推交際塲所了，因爲你在那裏所見的多是陌生人，在主人給你簡單介紹過後，就得由你自己去找出話頭，並設法保持談話的繼續，否則你就不免陷於窘境。現在中上家庭間所流行的「派對」倒是一個練習社交談話的適當塲所。</p>
<p>一對情侶之問的談話，是最「羅曼的克」的，而且也是最　秘的。這種談話祗有當事人　　解，且其談話的意味，往　稍縱即逝，事後再也不能回憶起來。你也許已經有了太太了，但你還能記得起當初你追求她時你們中問得談話嗎？</p>
<p>寫小說，拍電影，最難的一個場面九十描寫一對情侶間的談話。當你看到小說書上描寫到此情此景時祗用一句「妹妹我愛你」，或在國產電影中聽見「我愛，你怎麼了？」那種俗不可耐的對白時，你祗會感到肉麻欲嘔，決不是你當初向她或他談情說愛時的眞象。</p>
<p>說話的態度也是說話藝術的－個重要節目．坦白與誠懇，是使說話發生力量的兩個條件。但坦白到怎樣的程度，就要看說話者本人的身份及對方的立塲．人人都說自己是喜歡坦白的，這也許是偵的，不過却有一個條件，即坦白到令聽者難受，那就有失雅道了。</p>
<p>然而誠懇却是必要的。即使是過了份的坦白，有以誠懇的態度出之，總能今聽者發生印象，不至减損他對你的好感。</p>
<p>以上是世故經臉之　的說話藝術，其問自然是充滿了虛僞的成份，可是你我旣生存在這個充滿虛僞的世界中，又豈能免俗！</p>
<p>最愜意，最富詩意與眞情的談話，應推二三良朋知己杯酒言歡之問的說話，因爲祗有在這種塲合，你的說話沒有利害的顧慮，也沒有一定的目的，祗是爲說話而說話罷了。在這種情形下的說話，雖往往前言不搭後語，有時簡直語無倫次，當時旣不記得話頭起自何處，事後更忘得乾乾凈凈。然而正唯是這種忘我的說話，才是說話的畢華，才是說話的詩境。</p>
<h3>茶話</h3>
<p>— 亦存</p>
<p>偶然從舊貨擔上「搶救」出一册鈔本的茶香室主人寫的「煮茶別錄」，杜造　凑，惡俗可　，因之，想到說點「茶的話」。</p>
<p>人類除第一人把茶葉冲水喝到嘴裏止渴是天才外，其餘可說都是「茶徒」；但茶終於發揚擴大，不但成了「國飲」，而且也成了我國僅有一些些外銷國產之一了。</p>
<p>不但是喝普通的好茶，就是「茶經」巾所說的一套，也能發揮茶的功用。茶的偵味，是表現在長途或工作得汗竭喉裂時一向被八作笑料的半飲一刹那。名貴的葉片考究的茶具，不惜工本的烹煮，悠　的情緖，做作地來品，辨，　，　，這祗是有閒階級的玩的花樣而已。依我看上難的飲茶，是在鄉村人家，他們從毛缸舀一碗　燒茶給你，那才偵是茶的知已，他們也有一句具有幽默風趣話：「我們人家雖小，可是茶葉却很大的呢」！偵有天籟之感。</p>
<h3>英雄之言</h3>
<p>— 而比</p>
<p>美國名將巴頓將軍，是第二次大戰中登陸諾曼第直搗柏林的英雄，用兵神連，屢次超過了艾森豪威爾元帥的估計，赫赫功　，永埀不朽，不想竟於年前在歐洲因撞車逝世，使美國失掉了一位最勇敢的軍事天才！戰時曾有日記，讀之但覺英氣逼人，今摘　一節，以　續者。</p>
<p>「一九四四年七月二十八日，奉勃拉特萊將軍口諭，委為第三軍軍長，並面受初步作戰機宜。二　九日，我就立即到古雷斯前綫視察。我看見有一個整個的裝甲旅集中在那邊，靜止不動，等我走到那所隱蔽在一座　禮拜堂後面的指揮部去時，却見大家正忙着研究地圖。我就問他們何以至今還沒有渡過西哀納河，他們說目前正在研究道個問題，不知何處可以强渡。我就問他們硏究得了什麼成績沒有，他們說還要看地岡。我就吿訴他們，我在到指軍部之前，先就已經試渡過了，河水深不過兩尺，敵人的防禦力只有一架機關槍，剛才還對我射擊了好久，可是瞄準也就實在太差，簡直是胡亂開一陣槍罷了。我吿訴他們一句遠東的諺語：百聞不如一見。接著就駡了他們一頓，問他們爲甚麼竟不敢試度。他們經過這一番教訓之後，從此成了一支極靖銳的勁旅。</p>
<p>「三十一日飯後，又到我軍右翼第八師司令部視察。師長米特爾頓欣然出迎，因爲他的部隊已經順利抵達了目的地塞留納河。他請示今後行止，我就吿訴他，古往今來的戰史中，不波河者必敗，所以他應當立即渡河。我們立即商議在龐多鮑附近搭橋渡河的辦法，忽然來了電話鈴聲，據前方報吿，塞留納河上的橋雖經破壞，竟仍堪應用！聽到了這個消息，不禁大喜，這偵是第三軍的一個吉兆。正在此時，又聽得第四裝甲旅已經攻佔橋東水閘，俘敵四千，快意之至。行軍中常聽說某事是不可能辦到的；而事實上居然都辦到了。第八師和第十五師之衝越亞佛朗許，就達到了所謂無法達到的任務。我何嘗不知道這樣用兵極險，但是又豈能凡事先存畏懼之心！」</p>

<h3>Implementation of Economic Reform Plan; National Economic Commission Approves Measures; Executive Yuan Strengthens Measures to Stabilize Prices</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Office, 8th] Premier Zhang Qun gave instructions on the current price surge at the National Economic Commission meeting on the 8th, stating that he would immediately supervise and urge relevant financial and economic departments to strengthen measures to stabilize this surge.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 8th] The Executive Yuan's National Economic Commission held its 29th meeting at 3:00 PM on the 8th, chaired by Premier Zhang. The main agenda items discussed were: the implementation measures of the economic reform plan. As a result of the discussion, the financial and agricultural sectors of the measures were first revised and approved. In the financial sector, matters such as the organization, preparation, capital allocation of county banks, the functions of the hui banks, the location of branches, the principles of establishment, the detailed division of labor between national banks (four banks, two bureaus, and one treasury), and the coordination and supervision of national banks over private banks are all detailed in the measures. In the agricultural sector, detailed measures are also stipulated for land rent issues, the formation of collective farms, the support of owner-farmers, the establishment of warehouses, the increase of agricultural production, and grain storage loans. Regarding the increase of agricultural production, a five-year progress chart is also formulated in the measures as a guideline. (See the full draft below.) The revised Inheritance Tax Law was passed. (The main points of the revision are published in the first column of the second page.)</p>
<h3>Full Text of Financial Measures</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Office, 8th] The full text of the draft measures concerning the financial sector of Item A of the economic reform plan passed by the National Economic Commission on the 8th is as follows: Original Plan (1) County banks are the basic-level institutions of the financial system and should be thoroughly rebuilt and supported in their development. Their main business is to develop the rural economy, facilitate local construction, and cooperate with the promotion of local autonomy. The principle of their establishment is one bank per county. Their funds are invested by county governments with public funds from counties, townships, and towns, and private shares can also be raised. At the same time, the Central Bank and provincial banks should make appropriate investments as promotional shares and should provide specialized personnel and provide business guidance and supervision.</p>
<p>County banks shall be assisted by the Farmers Bank of China, the Bank of Communications, or the Bank of China, depending on their business category and needs.</p>
<p>Implementation Measures: County banks are the basic-level institutions of the financial system, and should be established universally with the purpose of developing the rural economy, assisting local construction, and cooperating with the promotion of local autonomy. Their loan business shall, in principle, be invested in agriculture, forestry, industry, mining, water conservancy, warehousing, health facilities, and other local construction projects within the county. The Ministry of Finance shall establish a county bank establishment planning committee in each province, organized jointly by the heads of the Civil Affairs, Finance, and Construction Departments, the manager of the Central Bank, the general manager of the provincial bank, and two persons designated by the Ministry of Finance, with the head of the Finance Department as the convener, responsible for planning the establishment of county banks and reorganizing existing county banks.

<h3>Li Zongren Prepares to Run for Vice President; Said to Receive Widespread Support</h3>
<p>[Our Beiping Office, 8th] Li Zongren officially announced to reporters on the 8th: He will run for the vice president after the implementation of the constitution, and ensure that he will win the election with the widespread support of the country. He said: "I am a South China native, and the people of the Pearl River Basin will undoubtedly support me. After the Northern Expedition, I was stationed in Wuhan and gave the people of the Yangtze River Basin a good impression. During the Anti-Japanese War, I fought in Xuzhou, and after the victory, I came to the North again, so I also have a deep relationship with the people of the Yellow River Basin. Chairman Ma Hongkui of Ningxia also promised to support me, and those who support me will include all walks of life. For example, last year, student movements occurred all over the country. Fortunately, no unfortunate events occurred in Beiping, all because I maintained an objective attitude. I believe that the students' original intentions are good, so the students' impression of me is also very good." Li also expressed his political views, saying: China can gradually solve its problems on its own, and it is not necessary to have US aid. However, if there is US aid, the problems can be solved faster. China is willing to maintain traditional friendship with the United States. China and the Soviet Union have contiguous borders, and we also hope to maintain friendly relations.</p>

<h3>To Remedy the Coal Shortage in Beijing and Shanghai, the Ministry of Economic Affairs Proposes Five Opinions and Submits Them to Chairman Chiang for Approval Before Implementation</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Office, 8th] In order to remedy the coal shortage in Beijing and Shanghai, the Ministry of Economic Affairs is trying to find ways. Minister of Economic Affairs Chen Qitian has consulted with Zhang Jia, President of the Central Bank, and others, and decided to provide five opinions for Chairman Chiang's approval before implementation. Among the five opinions, the most important are to strengthen transportation and purchase foreign coal. The current coal shortage is not due to low production, but due to transportation delays. Large quantities of coal are stored in Qinhuangdao and along the Jinpu Railway, waiting to be transported. Chen et al.'s opinion is to request the chairman's approval to transport it by special train on the Jinpu Railway and order the military agencies not to add any obstacles. Foreign exchange is required to purchase foreign coal, so the chairman is also requested to approve it. It is reported that Shanghai needs more than 200,000 tons of coal per month. The original plan was to store 100,000 tons of safe coal in Shanghai, but now there are only 30,000 tons left, and it has recently begun to be used. Therefore, it is urgent to prepare countermeasures. There are nearly 50,000 tons of coal in the Huadong mine, which will be shipped out in advance. This is approved by the Army Headquarters. There are 500,000 tons of coal waiting to be transported in Qinhuangdao, which can be used to supply Shanghai. The coal stored in Huainan Mine is very abundant, which is enough to supply the capital and the areas along the Beijing-Shanghai line. In addition, the director of the Shanghai Fuel Management Committee of the Ministry of Economic Affairs has been ordered to go to Taiwan to discuss the transportation of Taiwan coal to Shanghai. If the above problems are solved, Beijing and Shanghai will not have any more difficulties with coal.</p>
<h3>Self-Sufficiency in Paper Can Be Realized in Three Years</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Office, 8th] The spokesperson of the National Economic Commission said on the 8th: The paper we have ordered from abroad is sufficient for the first half of this year. After this half year, the domestic paper production increase plan has been realized, so there will be no shortage of paper in the future. He also declared that we will definitely achieve self-sufficiency in three years. In addition, we purchased 18 million US dollars of paper from abroad last year, of which pulp accounted for 10%. This year, it will be changed to increase pulp raw materials and reduce the import of finished products. At the same time, pulp raw materials will be allocated to various factories, and it will be limited that 50% of the increased production should be made into newspapers. It is enough to purchase 14 million US dollars of paper this year, and the rest will be given to various paper mills to add necessary equipment. This opinion has been agreed by the Import and Export Committee. He also said that the 20,000 tons of paper currently used in China are still orders from the first quarter of last year. One-third of the paper in the second quarter has not been imported, two-thirds of the third quarter and all of the fourth quarter have not been imported, so the current source of newspapers is very abundant.</p>
<h3>Special Envoy Ye Arrives in Kunming from Burma; Misunderstandings About Border Demarcation by Burmese Have Been Resolved; Rangoon Rice and Timber are Controlled by Our Overseas Chinese Merchants</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Kunming, 8th] Our Special Envoy Ye Gongchao and his party left Rangoon by special plane and returned to China today, arriving in Kunming at 1:40 PM. Special Envoy Ye told our reporter at the airport: "Burma used to know little about our country, but the friendship between the two countries will be strengthened in the future. Si Jiao, Director of the Internal Territorial Division, previously published an article on the demarcation of the Sino-Burmese border, which caused a great response in Burma. In addition, the malicious propaganda of the Communist Party made the Burmese government and people feel very uneasy, and even rumors that our troops would enter Burma. After I explained that our country attaches great importance to Burma as brothers and has no intentions, I was relieved. Now the economy of overseas Chinese in Burma is very stable, and all the rice and timber in Rangoon are controlled by overseas Chinese."</p>
<h3>Once Our Currency System is Reformed, the Black Market for Gold and Banknotes Can Be Eliminated; Huang Yuanbin Makes a Speech in Guangzhou</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Guangzhou, 8th] Huang Yuanbin, a member of the National Economic Commission, said in Guangzhou: "From my personal observation, US aid to China should prioritize reform of the currency system borrowing." Huang requested that after the currency system is reformed, a method of unlimited exchange of foreign exchange can be adopted, and the black market for gold and banknotes will naturally be reduced, and speculation will be eradicated. Huang also believes that the reform of the currency system may restore the general price level to the pre-war level. According to the statistics of the ten years since the Anti-Japanese War, until May last year, the amount of legal tender issued increased by one time, and the price of goods generally rose by four to six times. Around October last year, every time the amount of legal tender issued increased by one time, the price of goods rose by ten times. As of the end of October last year, the total amount of legal tender issued was about 28 trillion yuan, and the amount of legal tender was about 10,000 times that before the war, and the price of goods rose to 100,000 times. The reason for the high price of goods, in general, is that the amount of legal tender accounts for one-tenth, and the remaining nine-tenths (that is, the 90,000 times increase in the price of goods) is entirely due to the people's disbelief in legal tender. Everyone is engaged in speculation, resulting in an excessively high currency circulation speed. Therefore, the purpose of reforming the currency system is, first, to solve the 90,000 times increase in the price of goods. Due to unlimited exchange of foreign exchange, there is no speculation, and the pre-war currency circulation speed can be restored, and the 90,000 times increase in the price of goods will be solved. That is, the current 100,000 times increase in the price of goods, calculated in current legal tender on the day of currency system reform, will suddenly drop to 10,000 times.</p>
<h3>Public Education Treatment Plan to be Discussed at State Council Today</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Office, 8th] The plan for adjusting the treatment of public education personnel will be submitted for discussion at the State Council meeting on the 9th. According to the plan, which has been carefully reviewed and decided by relevant parties several times, it is stipulated that 30 yuan shall be used as the base amount, and salaries shall be issued according to the cost of living index. Those above 30 yuan shall be calculated at 1/10 of the cost of living index, and adjusted every three months in different regions. The problem of the cost of living index and the extraction of the division shall be planned and decided by the Directorate General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics.</p>

<h3>Demolition Issue Sparks Calls to Reclaim Hong Kong</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Nanjing, Eighth] Official and semi-official circles here are deeply indignant at the Hong Kong government's handling of the Kowloon City issue. A certain senator strongly condemned British imperialism. It is said that government officials are unanimously advocating the recovery of Hong Kong, but opinions differ on how and when to recover it. Some argue that the Hong Kong issue should be temporarily shelved during this civil war in the hope of maintaining friendly relations with Britain. Others advocate immediately recovering sovereignty over Hong Kong because, first, Hong Kong is currently a base of operations for all anti-government parties, such as the activities of Li Jishen and the illegal Minzhi Party there. Second, Hong Kong is currently a smuggling route. However, some observers believe that the activities of disgruntled politicians in Hong Kong are not enough to endanger the government, and the Hong Kong government has agreed to prevent smuggling. Foreign businessmen unanimously feel that the recovery of Hong Kong should not be discussed until the internal difficulties in China are resolved. They point out that Hong Kong is currently the only economically and socially stable place in China, allowing merchants to conduct business with peace of mind, and Hong Kong's trade indirectly benefits China.</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>How to Cure the Problem of Rising Prices?</h3>
<p>Recently, because of the soaring prices and the people's livelihood being uneasy, the various calls for cracking down on hoarding and speculation, and controlling important daily necessities, have been shouted out along with measures such as stopping loans and stopping remittances. At the time when the Central Bank was about to issue large banknotes of 10,000 yuan or more, in order to prevent price fluctuations, a credit squeeze was implemented. Some believed that as long as some negative measures such as stopping something were taken, the rising trend of prices could be curbed. Who knew that those who stopped stopped, and those who rose rose, almost as unrelated as the wind, the horse, and the ox. So the brains of the big shots turned to control and cracking down. They always avoided talking about the fundamental methods of balancing the budget and stopping the increase of currency issuance, and only made articles on the negative aspects of abandoning eating because of choking. So the old methods of registering materials and inspecting warehouses, which were ineffective during the war, are about to be brought out again. The government is anxiously discussing, and society is also discussing. The mountain rain is about to come, and the wind is filling the building. Prices have "taken off" in these few days, seemingly intentionally giving people a stab!</p>
<p>We believe that the only cure for stabilizing prices is the eight characters "Increase Production, Balance Budget". Everything else is just a trick. As for hoarding and speculation, we must first clarify a few concepts:</p>
<p>First, there is a difference between so-called hoarding and speculation and legitimate inventory. For example, a factory accumulating raw materials, fuel, or even finished products, or a merchant storing goods of its own industry with its legitimate capital, although seemingly hoarding in form, is actually an investment nature, not a speculative nature. It is actually different from hoarding and speculation and cannot be equated. If it is necessary for the left hand to come in and the right hand to go out, causing the bottom to be exhausted and unable to be replenished, what benefit is this to the entire national economy?</p>
<p>Second, Shanghai is a hub for the collection and distribution of goods and is also a center of production. The legitimate inventory of various materials is not only related to the lifeline of industry and commerce in this city but is also the source of supply for various ports in the interior. When striving to eliminate hoarding, how should we take into account all aspects so as not to make legitimate merchants regard inventory as a dangerous path and flock to speculation, thereby endangering the vitality of industry and commerce?</p>
<p>Third, hoarding should be innocent, and speculation is only guilty. Because in times of material shortage, if there were no previous inventories, then when time is of the essence, the people's necessities would be threatened. Therefore, having hoarding is, at best, a matter of the high and low prices, and prohibiting hoarding may turn into the question of whether or not materials are available. During the eight years of the Anti-Japanese War, the industry in the rear was not interrupted, and the daily necessities of the people's livelihood were not lacking. Perhaps a part of it was still relying on the power of hoarding and inventory. Therefore, hoarding cannot be regarded as harming the national economy and the people's livelihood, and speculation for huge profits is not tolerated by society.</p>
<p>Fourth, when everyone mentions hoarding, they scold unscrupulous merchants, especially Shanghai's unscrupulous merchants. In fact, this is also a superficial argument. It must be known that the current hoarding is not in formal merchants, but in retail investors who have no way out for hot money. Retail investors are all over China and are definitely not limited to Shanghai. The reason why retail investors hoard goods is definitely not for the purpose of speculation, but to protect the value of the legal tender in their hands. Previously, the Central Bank's six million ounces of gold were turned into rings worn on the fingers of maids, elder sisters, and rickshaw pullers under such psychology. When gold could no longer be purchased, rural agricultural products and urban manufactured products became the target of retail investors' hoarding. Therefore, despite stopping loans and stopping remittances to Shanghai, prices are still rising, and prices in the interior are rising faster than in Shanghai. In today's terms of hoarding, almost everyone is doing it! Who is doing it? Who is causing it?</p>
<p>We must first understand these seemingly plain but essential concepts, and then assess whether the strategies of the big shots in charge of economic policy can cure the problem. Unfortunately, they are still unwilling to admit that this is caused by the devaluation of the legal tender and the lack of materials. Instead, they blame all the evils on the "unscrupulous merchants" who hoard and speculate. As a result, the "Extraordinary Period Measures for Cracking Down on Hoarding and Speculation of Important Daily Necessities," which had long been ineffective, are once again regarded as treasures. In this way, all items must be registered. After registration, they must be inspected. If the inspection reveals even a slight suspicion, they can be confiscated and turned over to the public. Merchants will go to jail and face lawsuits. As a result of this panic, warehouses can be emptied, merchants will be forced to stop trading, goods will no longer be replenished, raw materials will gradually be exhausted, and factories will have to shut down. Even with money, it will not be possible to buy daily necessities, and social order will be difficult to maintain. Once the consequences are like this, how can we imagine? Government officials, worried about the country and the people, believe that the current state of the people's livelihood is all caused by unscrupulous merchants. For the benefit of the majority of the people, only by sacrificing a few unscrupulous merchants can the country be prosperous and the people be at peace. But I wonder if they have thought about the various considerations mentioned above? In the unlikely event that our concerns are unfortunately confirmed, wouldn't it cause pain to those close to us and joy to our enemies during the period of bandit suppression and rebellion?</p>
<p>The key to solving this problem is that the devaluation of the currency is the main cause. We should prescribe the right medicine for this aspect and stabilize it. If we want to crack down on hoarding and speculation, we must fundamentally make the hoarders have nothing to hoard. Therefore, we can make the following suggestions:</p>
<p>Stabilizing the legal tender and balancing the budget are not absolutely impossible. At the very least, it should be possible to stabilize it from the current situation. If the government seriously rectifies various taxes and makes them appropriate for the public, merges all redundant agencies to eliminate waste, temporarily eliminates unnecessary expenditures to reduce the burden on the national treasury, and sells the received enemy and puppet industries and foreign aid materials as soon as possible to withdraw the legal tender, then although there are huge military expenditures, it can still considerably prevent the increase in issuance. Moreover, the calls for US loans and assistance are very high, and stabilizing the legal tender should not be hesitated any longer. After the budget is balanced and the legal tender is stabilized, prices will also be stabilized. People will not be afraid, and hoarding will be defeated without a fight. This is a fundamental solution. We believe that it is much more effective than negative measures such as registration and inspection.</p>
<p>Replenishing materials is also easy to do. In addition to changing the "stop" policy and doing everything possible to support agriculture and industry to increase production, many materials are already in the hands of the government. As long as the government handles the distribution more seriously, at least the minimum daily necessities for the people's livelihood can be supplied. The most needed by the people's livelihood is food. The grain collected from land tax by the Ministry of Food should be able to regulate the people's food supply, not to mention the food from foreign aid? As for edible oil, the China Vegetable Oil Factory should be able to supply it. As for cloth, the government has already controlled 70%, and it may be able to assume its responsibility. As for fuel, there is already a Fuel Management Committee for the overall planning of coal, and there is also the China Petroleum Corporation for the distribution of petroleum. As long as the departments in charge can start from the positive aspects of "increasing production and opening up sources," and not just focus on making profits as their negative goal, it is expected that daily necessities may be full of markets. Once there are more supplies, hoarders will have nothing to speculate, so why hoard? This is an effective way to get to the root of the problem, and it is not effective by registration and inspection alone.</p>
<p>If the government officials regard the above suggestions as commonplace and only regard the "Extraordinary Period Measures for Cracking Down on Hoarding and Speculation of Important Daily Necessities" as the only magic weapon that can still be used, then we are willing to further discuss tomorrow the reasons why this measure is difficult to implement, so as to correct the experts.</p>

Simplify the assessment procedure: If the taxpayer has objections to the tax amount assessed by the assessment agency, in the past, they could apply for assessment to the Inheritance Tax Review Committee, which was very inconvenient. It has been deleted, and if the taxpayer has objections, they can file a petition, re-petition, and administrative lawsuit according to law for relief. 3. Implement rewards and punishments to prevent tax evasion: The amended measures stipulate that those who report and pay within the time limit will be deducted 10% of the tax payable; otherwise, they will be punished to show rewards and punishments. 4. Implement in-kind tax payments: In the past, if the inheritance was in-kind, it had to be auctioned and paid in cash. Now, it is changed to that if the inheritance is auctioned twice and no one takes it over, it will be paid at the final estimated price. The in-kind payment is limited to land, houses, and public bonds. 5. Adjust the tax threshold according to the price index: In the future, the adjustment of the tax threshold will be adjusted once a year in January and July according to the national price index compiled by the Directorate General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics, which will be submitted to the Executive Yuan for approval and announced for implementation.</p>
<p>Method for the Collection and Allocation of Inheritance Tax on Dispersed Estates</p>
<p>[Report] The Ministry of Finance, considering that inheritance tax is a tax shared by the central and local governments, has already detailed the collection and payment methods for estates located only in one place. However, there were no clear regulations in the past regarding the allocation of inheritance tax for estates dispersed in various places. The following five new methods are now being drafted:</p>
<p>For inheritance tax on estates dispersed in various places, the main collection agency will fill out the receipt and hand it over to the taxpayer to first pay to the bank acting as the national treasury in the usual place, and list it as a special account for the tax funds collected on behalf.</p>
<p>The main collection agency will calculate the tax payable in each place according to the proportion of the estate amount in each place to the total estate amount, and notify the collection agency in each place.</p>
<p>The main collection agency shall fill out the payment vouchers for the accounts of the relevant collection agencies separately according to the treasury part of the tax payable in the local and other places, and pay them into the local treasury. The treasury shall directly send the receipt and the reporting link to the revenue agency specified in the payment voucher. (When submitting the payment voucher, a check from a special account should be issued and submitted at the same time.)</p>
<p>The main collection agency shall indicate on the payment voucher that it has opened on behalf of the tax money of the local government has been sent directly by the collection agency that filled out the payment voucher on behalf to the relevant city and county governments.</p>
<p>The main collection agency should take out the tax money to be given to each city and county government in the special deposit account with a check, send it directly to the relevant city and county government, and send a letter to each city and county government to send the official seal to the tax collection agency in charge of the business after receiving the tax payment. The tax due shall be deducted from the allocated tax revenue.</p>

<h3>Unlawful Individuals in Xi'an Transporting Banknotes to Shanghai for Profit</h3>
<p>70 Billion Seized in the Last Ten Days</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Xi'an, Eighth] Unlawful merchants and special classes have been trying their best to return large banknotes transported to Shaanxi by precious air transport tonnage to Shanghai for profit in the last ten days. Since the four banks stopped large sums of money from being remitted from Shaanxi to Beijing and Shanghai, the black market exchange rate has been as high as 20% to 25%. The air freight for transporting cash is only 275,000 yuan per kilogram. It is heard that some people dare to conceal it as ordinary goods by special means and entrust it to air transport. In this case, the freight for each kilogram of banknotes is only equivalent to the black market exchange fee of 200,000 yuan for remittances. Yesterday, an aircraft of China Aviation Corporation flying from here to Shanghai was seized by the Third Supply Sub-Office of the Air Force with a batch of cash, totaling 5 billion.

<h3>Future of Filipino Chinese Vendors Bleak; Request to Revoke Prohibition Not Approved by Supreme Court</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Manila, Seventh] More than a thousand Filipino Chinese vendors here will definitely be subject to the city government's prohibition in the recent weeks because their petition to revoke the effectiveness of the city government's order prohibiting the vendors was rejected by the Philippine Supreme Court this afternoon. The reasons held in their petition were that the city government order was formulated by the Manila City Council and was unconstitutional. Officials of our embassy here still made a final effort yesterday afternoon to prevent Chinese vendors from being subject to prohibition, but according to general observation, the only hope of these thousands of Chinese will be very dim.</p>
<h3>Increased Canal Water Level Restores Shipping in Northern Jiangsu</h3>
<p>[Report from our Zhenjiang office, 8th] At the end of the canal, there are ten dams returning to the Yangtze River, including Bihe, Fenghuang, Jinwan, Dongwan, Xiwan, Chushan, Lanjiang, Buzihe, Xinhe, and Shahe. When the water rises, they are opened to discharge water into the Yangtze River, and when the water recedes, they are closed to store water for navigation. Historically, the opening and closing of these dams has been managed by the salt affairs agencies with dedicated funds. However, after the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, the salt affairs agencies changed, and no funds were prepared for this purpose. Consequently, the aforementioned dams returning to the Yangtze River were opened but not closed, allowing the water to flow freely. In particular, the Bihe Dam discharged water so uninhibitedly that during the winter water shortage, it was completely drained. The water level in the canal from Wantou to Yangzhou was only a little over three feet, hindering navigation and causing transport ships to suspend operations one after another, also disrupting military transport. Previously, the Jiangsu Provincial Government ordered the Canal Engineering Bureau to undertake closure works, setting a deadline for completion to facilitate navigation. Now, it is learned that the Wantou Bihe Dam was closed on the seventh, and the Lanjiang Dam is being rushed. Materials for other dams, such as Fenghuang, have been stored, and work will begin soon. Currently, the water level in the canal has risen, with the shallowest point being nearly four feet and the deepest point being five or six feet. All classes of ships have gradually resumed sailing.</p>

<h3>Implementation Measures for Economic Plan: Full Text of Agricultural Part Draft</h3>
<p>[Report from our Nanjing office, 8th] The National Economic Council passed an economic reform plan on the eighth. The draft of the agricultural part of the measures is as follows: "Farmers constitute the majority of the national population, and agriculture is the backbone of the Chinese economy. Only with developed agriculture, a prosperous countryside, and purchasing power among the people can industry be sustained and society be stabilized. Therefore, developing agriculture and prospering the countryside are the main objectives of future economic policy." This has been listed as the goal of the agricultural part in the original plan. Considering that agriculture is for comprehensive construction and should be promoted by farmers themselves, but China's countryside is declining, farmers' knowledge is low, and production technology is poor, the government should provide effective guidance, encouragement, and protection. At the same time, experimental research, disaster prevention improvement, and management should be handled by a government-established, strong, and capable institution to facilitate promotion. Furthermore, large-scale agricultural relief materials from the United Nations Supply should have appropriate institutions and sufficient funds to cooperate in order to be effectively utilized. Based on the original plan, the implementation measures are formulated as follows. Original plan one (the content is very long and was published in our newspaper on July 24th of last year, omitted here due to limited space). Implementation measures: (A) Restricting farmland rent. Farmland rent should be restricted according to the following provisions to set the maximum rent amount: - In areas where land prices have been legally determined, the land rent shall not exceed 8% of the land price; 2 In areas where land prices have not been legally determined, the land rent shall not exceed one-third of the main agricultural product. Farmland landlords shall not collect rent in advance, but if it is customary to collect security deposits, the amount shall not exceed one-quarter of the annual rent payable and shall be calculated based on the local general interest rate to offset the land rent payable. Landlords who provide housing, livestock, fertilizer, seeds, or other production tools to tenants may collect appropriate compensation in addition to the land rent, but it shall not exceed 10% annual interest on the price at the time of supply. Land tenants who pay land tax on behalf of the landlord shall deduct it from the rent payable for the current year. County governments should mobilize village schools, rural communities at all levels, and cooperatives to implement publicity and assistance regarding rent restriction and send guidance personnel to rural areas to guide and supervise implementation. Appoint personnel to supervise the review and registration of tenancy contracts entered into by landlords and tenants by township offices. If the terms stipulated in the lease conflict with current laws and regulations, the landlord and tenant shall be ordered to correct them. Tenancy disputes shall be mediated by the county government organizing county and township rent mediation committees. (B) Self-cultivating farmers: The government may delineate the following areas as demonstration zones for supporting self-cultivating farmers: 1 Areas among tenanted lands, 2 Areas where land has been illegally distributed by the communists, 3 Areas along rivers that have been flooded and are undergoing reconstruction, 4 Areas where wasteland reclamation is being implemented, 5 Areas where the government and large-scale farmland water conservancy are involved. Private land within the areas delineated for supporting self-cultivating farmers shall be requisitioned by the government in accordance with the law. The land price shall be assessed by the government in accordance with the law and converted into agricultural products, with land bonds used to compensate for it in installments over a number of years. The repayment period shall not exceed fifteen years. The aforementioned land bonds shall be issued by a national land financial institution designated by the government. After the land within the areas for supporting self-cultivating farmers has been requisitioned and consolidated, it shall be divided into unit farms and allocated to farmers for cultivation in the following order: - The original landowners who return to self-cultivation; 2 The original tenant farmers; 3 Retired soldiers with cultivation ability and the families of soldiers who fought in the War of Resistance; 4 Tenant farmers and farmers from the county. The area of the aforementioned unit farms shall be determined by the government, taking into account local economic conditions and land characteristics. The recipients of unit farms shall pay the assessed land price converted into agricultural products to the national land financial institution in installments over a number of years. The payment period shall not exceed fifteen years. Before the land price is fully paid, the land received shall be used as collateral. If the unit farm received has been improved and re-planned by the government, the construction costs may be appropriately collected and included in the assessed land price. The recipients of unit farms shall pay land tax in accordance with the law from the date of receipt. However, if the farm received was originally wasteland that needs to be reclaimed by the recipient, the land tax may be exempted for three to five years. Unit farms shall not be divided in any way after they are received. If the recipient does not cultivate the land himself or rents out all or part of the farm, the government shall immediately recover the farm received, return the land price paid, and allocate it to another recipient. When unit farms are allocated, the government shall guide and assist in forming cooperative farms, and the measures shall be determined separately. Provincial and county agricultural institutions should guide cooperative farms to use new agricultural tools and machinery, improve varieties, chemical fertilizers, and pest control products. The Farmers Bank of China and the Central Cooperative Bank should provide as much capital as possible to cooperative farms. (C) Conducting soil surveys and land classification so that land resources can be used rationally. Conduct a national soil survey, adopt simple methods, first complete the survey of soil quality and soil properties nationwide as a standard for fertilization, and coordinate with the production increase plan. Start with the soil surveys of special crops such as cotton, tea, and tobacco, and then gradually proceed to the soil surveys of major crop areas such as rice and wheat. In coordination with the soil survey, conduct a national land classification survey, including topography, climate, plant types, current and potential yields, the size of farms, forests, and pastures, population density, and necessary matters such as land prices, land taxes, transportation, and transportation. Based on the results of soil surveys and land classification surveys, conduct land classification and delineate national agricultural areas, so that agriculture, forestry, and animal husbandry can be appropriately allocated, and land resources can be rationally utilized.

<h3>Marshall Shows His Hand to the Senate: Urges Passage of the European Aid Plan; Cannot Sit Idly By and Watch Western Europe in Crisis</h3>
<p>[United Press Washington 8th] Marshall appeared before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee today to report on his European aid plan. Before Marshall's report, Committee Chairman Vandenberg summarized the outline of the Marshall Plan.</p>
<p>[Reuters Washington 8th] Secretary of State Marshall bluntly told the Senate Foreign Relations Committee on the eighth that if the Republican members of Congress were to carry out their threats and reduce the amount of U.S. aid provided under the European Recovery Program, it would be better to abandon the plan altogether. The current issue is whether to meet the needs of the plan or not implement it at all. A non-partisan plan would only waste U.S. resources and would not be effective. Marshall further stated: The way of life we know is in a state of peril. It is neither easy nor guaranteed that the New World is undertaking this unprecedented effort to aid the Old World. This is a calculated risk. All we can say at present is that this plan has a method of succeeding, but I believe that if we maintain the will to succeed, we will surely achieve it. Marshall went on to emphasize the following points: The aid plan must begin no later than April 1st of this year, otherwise, some of the basic conditions on which the entire plan is based will change. The estimated six billion dollars needed in the first fifteen months is the absolute minimum needed. The U.S. share of the aid amount for the entire four-and-a-half-year implementation of the European Recovery Program is between 15 billion and 17 billion dollars. Although the United States provides assistance, it must not interfere in the foreign policies of European countries or attach conditions that would undermine the European cooperation system. If the aid program is not passed by Congress or unfortunately fails, the national security of the United States will be threatened, and in fact, it will be tantamount to placing itself in an armed camp. He firmly rejected the Republican proposal to set up an institution independent of the State Department to manage the European aid program, forcefully arguing that there cannot be two secretaries of state in the United States at the same time. He pointed out that the Soviet Union and the Communist Party are determined to undermine the European Recovery Program, which will make the implementation of the program more difficult. At the beginning of his statement, Marshall emphasized that if a sound European economy is not restored, the hope of the American people and free people everywhere to seek peace, justice, security, and welfare for themselves and their descendants will suffer the most serious damage. During a period of famine, poverty, distress, and the resulting turmoil that threatens the 270 million people of Western Europe, social standards and political conditions in every aspect will continue to deteriorate rapidly. Sitting idly by will prevent them from escaping economic bankruptcy, social unrest, and widespread and violent political conflicts, and will ultimately lead to the collapse of the historical base of Western civilization. The forces of despotism that we fought hard to destroy do not appear to have been destroyed, and the vacuum created in Western Europe may ultimately be filled by forces that are the source of war.</p>
<h3>Marshall's Firm Attitude: Will Resign if Plan is Changed; Hope for Swift Passage of the European Aid Plan</h3>
<p>[Reuters Washington 8th] Secretary of State Marshall's strong counterattack in the Senate Foreign Relations Committee against the Republican criticisms of the European Recovery Program has renewed hope that Congress can be expected to pass the bill quickly. Because this year is an election year and because of Marshall's own power in the realm of public opinion, his remarks are of great power.</p>
<p>Only a few members of Congress are willing to oppose this figure who enjoys bipartisan support second only to President Roosevelt. In addition, Marshall himself has never used the presidential campaign as a slogan and will never be accused of playing politics, so the support given to Marshall by the people is even more effective. In the twenty-four hours before Marshall appeared before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee to speak, when he entered Congress before President Truman to listen to Truman deliver his State of the Union address, members of both parties in both houses gave him a warm applause. Today, his statement in the Senate Foreign Relations Committee fully demonstrated his frank and resolute American spirit, reminding people of his achievements in assisting President Roosevelt during the war. Republican leaders do not oppose Marshall's aid plan in principle, but they are trying to reduce the amount of aid. However, Marshall has stated that if the amount of aid is reduced, it will become a useless relief plan and no longer a recovery plan. Observers believe that if Congress refuses to grant an appropriate management plan or appropriate aid funds, Marshall will resign and leave rather than be the captain of a ship that is not properly equipped. His statement in the Senate Foreign Relations Committee that the United States cannot have two secretaries of state is tantamount to implying his willingness to resign. 1948 is the year of the re-election of one-third of the senators and all members of the House of Representatives, and it is expected that no member will be willing to risk the great disapproval of ousting the most popular secretary of state.</p>
<h3>Vandenberg and Taft Differ on Aid to Europe</h3>
<p>Republicans Find Symbol of Division</p>
<p>[Reuters Washington 8th] The Senate Foreign Relations Committee began reviewing opinions on the Marshall Aid Plan on the eighth, and a symbol of division has been found within the Republican Party regarding the Marshall Plan. The differences of opinion within the Republican Party are becoming clearer due to the conflicting arguments of two Republican leaders, Senators Taft and Vandenberg. Vandenberg has deep trust in the Marshall Plan and is truly trying to fight for the plan on a bipartisan basis, while Taft has publicly stated that he advocates reducing the total amount of aid and expects that the debate on the bill in Congress will be difficult to end before July 1 at the earliest. Taft and Vandenberg both have strong support, so the incompatibility of their opinions may cause a split within the Republican Party.</p>
<h3>Truman's Speech to Congress Meets with Extremely Cold Response; Republican Members Respond with Jeers</h3>
<p>[Reuters Washington 7th] When President Truman read his annual State of the Union address in Congress today, the response in the hall was extremely cold. The hall only applauded when the President entered and left the hall. In addition, only when he mentioned the anti-union law proposed by the Republican Party and reiterated his call for universal military training was there sparse applause in the hall. Observers say that this is because the Republican majority members of both houses are disgusted by Truman's proposals. It is expected that his call for people of both parties to abandon party views in this election year for the sake of national interests will not be responded to.</p>
<p>[Reuters Washington 7th] House Republican Leader Halleck commented on President Truman's message, calling it full of inflammatory language. If approved, it would increase government spending by billions of dollars. This does not sound like it came from the mouth of the President, but if it came from the mouth of a presidential candidate. House Appropriations Committee Chairman Taber believes that the tax plan proposed by the President will damage production and is a reactionary proposal. House Speaker Martin pointed out that Truman wanted to stimulate his sinking political status.</p>
<p>[United Press Washington 7th] In the report on the federal situation submitted to Congress today, it was unexpected that President Truman did not emphasize the current state of world unrest. However, he emphasized that the national defense of the United States must be strong. Afterwards, the President suggested reducing the taxes of citizens with lower incomes. Republican members were quite disgusted with the President's report and often made mocking sounds during the President's report.</p>
<h3>Wallace Comments: Considers it Repetition</h3>
<p>[United Press New York 8th] American presidential candidate Wallace said on the eighth that President Truman's federal message was "old tune in a new bottle," no different from the purpose he proposed in 1946. If he were still president in 1958, his purpose would probably remain the same, and there would be no progress to speak of. However, Du still asked to amend the Taft-Hartley Labor Act, and the only bill he proposed that could pass was probably the Compulsory Military Service Bill.</p>

<h3>Moroccan Leader Advocates North African Independence Movement</h3>

<h3>If the Marshall Plan Fails, Britain Prepares for Self-Reliance - Cripps Explains Financial Situation</h3>
<p>[British Information Service, London, 8th] British Chancellor of the Exchequer, Sir Stafford Cripps, today announced the British economic plan for 1948 at a press conference. He stated that the two major goals for this year are to earn more US dollars and further promote a balance in overseas trade. If Britain earns 50% of its target amount of US dollars this year, the country will still have a US dollar shortfall of £300 million for the entire year.</p>
<p>Cripps addressed the difficulties caused by rising global prices, stating, "Even the quantity and price of imported goods are increasing." Cripps concluded with a statement regarding the Marshall Plan, saying that Britain would inevitably be in a difficult position regarding US dollars unless this plan is implemented soon. Without US dollars, Britain would be unable to obtain imports of food and raw materials from the Western Hemisphere, and we would also be unable to export coal, steel, and other important goods to Western European countries. If we do not receive assistance to alleviate our US dollar shortage, we will be unable to participate in the European recovery, and therefore unable to participate in the global recovery. We will have no choice but to revert to a policy of urgently seeking self-reliance.</p>
<h3>An International Conman - "Chinese Army General" - Wang Zhike Blusters</h3>
<p>— Our Correspondent in Japan, Chen Luo</p>
<p>In early spring of last year, a frenzied "gold rush" era emerged throughout Japan, exposing the 50 billion yen worth of concealed goods left behind by the military cliques. Kyoto, which was at the forefront of concealed cotton cloth, was a region where brokers and agents from across Japan were covered in banknotes, like ants swarming on fat. The various factions fought openly and covertly, displaying extraordinary activity and causing a sensation throughout society. In the midst of this whirlwind, a figure suddenly emerged: "Chinese Army General Wang Zhike!"</p>
<p>Such a General</p>
<p>General Wang was said to be a leading figure in the Green Gang and a former member of the Peace Preservation Army Council. At his command, the 1.5 million-strong Peace Preservation Army stationed near Shanghai would mobilize at any moment. He owned the "China South Shipping Company" in Shanghai, with a total of thirty-five ships. Wang's Japanese name was Otsuka Hirokuni. At the same time, it was said that he was purely Chinese, while others claimed he was of mixed Chinese-Japanese descent. It is unknown which is the truth.</p>
<p>At the time, General Wang's confidants and staff included the once-notorious "East Sea Pirate" Ko Unryoku Ichiro and Captain Nakajima Yukinosuke of the Kwantung Army Military Police. They spread the word that "General Wang is responsible for all goods transported to China and is also responsible for negotiating compensation for goods with the authorities of the Chinese delegation stationed in Japan. He also has the power to divert a portion of these goods for use within Japan."</p>
<p>Upon hearing this news, the Japanese rushed to his door. Among them was the former Superintendent General of the Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department, Marude Tsurukichi, nicknamed "Bald Crane," who immediately dispatched Watanabe, the general manager of Marutake Trading Company, to Kyoto to meet General Wang. Marutake Trading Company was a business jointly operated by Maruyama Tsurukichi and Watanabe Takejiro, a former secretary of the Police Department. The company was based in Tokyo, ostensibly selling agricultural tools for rural use, but in reality, it specialized in black market and controlled military uniforms and cotton cloth. As soon as Watanabe saw General Wang's demeanor, he couldn't help but be deeply impressed. General Wang's bald head was even balder than that of his master, "Bald Crane," and he was short, stout, and full-bellied. From every angle, General Wang appeared to be a top-tier Chinese figure.</p>
<p>Dream of Fortune</p>
<p>At this time, Kyoto businessman Wakaoji Tomofumi visited Kato Juro of Tobo Trading Company in Tokyo, saying, "The cloth that General Wang is handling for transport to China is planned to be processed and manufactured before being shipped, which will greatly benefit the domestic sewing industry." Kato was a former reporter for the Jiji Shinpo newspaper, who was now down on his luck. How could he not want to go to Kyoto to make a fortune when such a good opportunity presented itself?</p>
<p>General Wang leisurely puffed on a cigar and looked down at Kato, smiling as he indicated that he would tell the delegation to sell 20,000 bolts of cloth from the Mitsui warehouse to Kato.</p>
<p>After returning home, Kato immediately prepared 10 million yen in cash (approximately US$100,000) to purchase the cloth, but he did not hand the money directly to General Wang at the time. Another man named Takizawa Mitsuo also entrusted 8 million yen to General Wang's confidants for the same reason. It was said that he would be able to remove the Western cloth from the Mitsui warehouse on March 27th, but the date passed and the goods were not delivered, so he realized something was amiss. He then sought out Nakajima, but Nakajima said, "Don't be impatient," and brushed him off.</p>
<p>First Doubts</p>
<p>On the evening of June 15th, the president of Kaneko Industries in Osaka visited Kato, saying that he had previously met General Wang through an introduction by Wakaoji and had been exploited using the name of "Chinese Special Service Agency stationed in Japan," and was taken for 50,000 yen, etc., and believed that General Wang was highly suspicious. Kato had already spent hundreds of thousands of yen on interest and hotel expenses from the 10 million yen he had borrowed to prepare for the purchase, so he rushed to Ko Unryoku's residence that night to inquire about the matter, but ultimately learned nothing. He then went to the Shimogamo Police Station to inquire. According to the police authorities, "Are you asking about General Wang? He is a contemporary Chinese nobleman and a sworn brother of Chiang Kai-shek. During the war, he was greatly praised by Chairman Chiang for finding ways to transport salt to China!"</p>
<p>Salt Smuggling Incident</p>
<p>Speaking of transporting salt reminded Kato of something from over a decade ago. In 1933 (Republic of China Year 22), Osaka's wealthy man, Shima Tokuzo, suffered the misfortune of the "Salt Smuggling Incident," which caused a sensation at the time. Behind this incident was a man named Otsuka Kyuzo. Otsuka was a Japanese man who grew up in Kyoto and went to China at the age of seventeen, working as a tea server on trains in Manchuria, giving him the opportunity to interact with gentry and prominent figures. He then specialized in swindling between Japan and Manchuria. Shortly after the Mukden Incident, Otsuka told Shima Tokuzo, "I have now obtained a special permit to transport salt to China," and obtained 2 million yen from Shima Tokuzo. After loading the salt, preparing to depart from Kobe, they were immediately arrested by the Osaka Military Police. At the time, there was no clear provision for "enemy collaboration," so Shima and Otsuka were interrogated for a month and then released. However, Shima was bankrupted as a result. The most detailed investigation of this matter at the time was conducted by Kato, the current former reporter for the Jiji Shinpo newspaper. Therefore, Kato immediately realized that the current General Wang was the same as the rare swindling expert Otsuka Kyuzo from before.</p>
<p>On the 17th, General Wang was suddenly summoned by a certain Kyoto agency. His home was searched, and valuable cigars and penicillin, etc., worth approximately 700,000 yen, were seized. As for the key power of attorney and other documents, they had already been burned and destroyed by Otsuka's daughter, Ikuko.</p>
<p>Sentenced to Labor</p>
<p>Otsuka, who was first detained at the police station, has now been sentenced to five years of labor and fined 7,500 yen by the Kyoto Military Tribunal.</p>
<p>Finally, the reporter must add a note: Tokue, (51 years old), Kawashima Yoshiko's sworn sister, was originally Otsuka's ex-wife. Since she had been divorced from Otsuka for nearly ten years, she had no connection to this incident. As for the international conman "Chinese Army General" Wang Zhike, under the bars of a jail cell reflecting on the past, it is unknown what he is thinking!</p>

<h3>Additional Courtrooms Added at the District Court - Causing Internal Disputes</h3>
<p>[Our Own Dispatch] Since the District Court was ordered to establish additional civil and criminal courts and promote judges to presiding judges, the other judges have expressed dissatisfaction. Recently, internal disputes have been increasing. A total of 32 civil and criminal court judges, led by Judge Wu Shaochang, submitted memorials yesterday to Guo Yunquan, the President of the High Court, and Zha Liangjian, the President of the District Court. The original memorial stated: "It is learned that the number of criminal cases handled by this court has always been large, and the personnel are insufficient, resulting in a backlog of cases, which has long been dissatisfied with society. Recently, the Ministry of Judicial Administration ordered the establishment of two additional civil courts and three criminal courts, and approved this court to guarantee the original judges Huang Guangyu, Zhong Xianda, Shen Tianbao, Zhu Yuhuang, Shi Cong and other five members to serve as presiding judges, hoping to improve the affairs of this court. The intentions are good, but there are still shortcomings in this measure, and the positions are personally involved. The following points are respectfully presented to the president: 1. The presiding judges assigned this time are all promoted from the original judges, and there are no new people selected from outside. In addition, no other judges have been assigned to the court, so the actual number of judges in the entire court has not increased. According to the usual practice of various courts, presiding judges handle fewer cases than ordinary judges. As a result, the addition of presiding judges this time is equivalent to reducing the number of cases handled by eight people. How can the efficiency of handling cases be increased by doing so? The original intention of the Ministry may be to reduce the backlog of cases, but the result may be to increase the backlog. 2. According to the regulations of the court organization, the task of the presiding judge is to 'supervise the affairs of each court and allocate them', and to be a judge of the collegiate panel, and his task as a presiding judge is far more important than the administrative aspects. Moreover, according to the provisions of Article 4, Paragraph 1 of the same law: 'The collegiate trial is presided over by the presiding judge. When there is no president or the president is absent, the senior member of the court shall serve as the president.' According to this interpretation, the presiding judge who serves as the presiding judge should be the most senior person in the entire court. Among the five newly appointed presiding judges in this court, some are senior, while others have only been serving as judges for less than three years, and their qualifications are very shallow among the judges in the entire court. This situation is not only insufficient to meet the legal intentions and show prudence, but also sufficient to inspire others to look down upon it, which is not a reasonable move."

<h3>Petty Conspirator Imprisoned - Confessed to Having Leadership Desires - Fantasized About Organizing an Action Team</h3>
<p>[Our Own Dispatch] Sixteen-year-old Jin Baoshan, from Shaoxing, using the alias Ye Yiyi, once studied at Gezhi Middle School. He suddenly claimed to be the captain of the Action General Team last year, and privately carved official seals and issued orders. On September 26th of last year, he appointed classmate Zhou Peirong as the captain of the squadron and entrusted Zhou to recruit 45 classmates as cadres, collecting a deposit of 300,000 yuan from each person. Zhou accidentally talked about it with the police station, and the matter was revealed. The police bureau, fearing that Jin had political motives, arrested Jin and transferred him to the court for investigation. Judge Zhong Xianda of the District Court opened a court hearing yesterday. Jin confessed that he usually had leadership desires, and was influenced by movies and comic books, so he wanted to organize an action team and serve as the leader himself. It was completely a "pretend" nature and had no political motives. After the trial, Judge Zhong sentenced Jin to four months in prison on the spot, and the official seal and orders were confiscated. This petty conspirator was thus imprisoned.</p>

<h3>Mediation of Year-End Bonus for Three Industries Including Enamelware Failed to Reach Agreement</h3>
<p>The Year-End Bonus Dispute Committee handled the following cases yesterday: *Enamelware Industry: The workers in the industry demanded that a one-month year-end bonus be issued. The employers stated that it was difficult to accept due to poor business conditions. The employer of Yifeng Enamelware Factory, the largest in scale, only agreed to issue 12 days. The remaining smaller factories will discuss it again after seeing the decision of Yifeng Factory. *Wool Spinning Industry: The labor side requested that it be issued at double the rate of the previous year's example of 23 days, 28 days, 33 days, and 38 days. The employer agreed to issue it at 60% of the previous year's amount, and it is still at a stalemate. *Dyeing and Weaving Industry: The white organization and dyers jointly requested to be issued according to the previous year's method, with the first category being issued in three types: 50 days, 40 days, and 27 days. The second and third categories would be reduced by two days each. However, the employers did not agree. As a result, all workers borrowed 60% of their salary before the 12th, and it was decided to continue discussions today. Workers in the dyeing and weaving group requested that it be issued at 90% of the previous year's amount of 40 days and 50 days. The employers did not agree. Last year, the patterned group issued 12 days and 15 days. The workers requested that this year they be issued according to the dyeing and finishing group, but the employers did not accept it. The matter will continue to be handled within days.</p>

<h3>Soviet Overseas Chinese Showing Wavering Intention to Return - Harsh Treatment and Cold Weather in Homeland - Final Batch of Over a Thousand to be Repatriated in March</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] Four batches of Soviet overseas Chinese in this city have been repatriated by the Soviet authorities last year. It is now learned that the fifth and final batch will be repatriated in March of this year, with an estimated number of over one thousand. However, it is still unknown whether all of them will be willing to return home at that time. According to sources familiar with the matter, some Soviet overseas Chinese in this city have recently received letters from relatives and friends who returned home in previous batches, complaining about the hardships of life after returning home, the cold weather in the country, and the harsh treatment. Therefore, the desire of Soviet overseas Chinese remaining in Shanghai to return home is showing signs of wavering.</p>

<h3>Young Man Commits Suicide Due to Marriage Problems - Suicide Note States He Was Forced to Death</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] Lu Qiyong, the sub-landlord at No. 180 Jiangxi North Road, reported to the Hongkou Police Bureau at 11:00 AM yesterday that a tenant living on the third floor, Ye Wei, 28 years old, from Guangdong, had committed suicide by locking himself in his room this morning and was on the verge of death, requesting assistance. Patrolman Jiang Peili led officers to investigate and forced open the door. They found an elderly woman in her sixties, suffering from hemiplegia, lying in bed. A young man (Ye Wei) was lying on the floor. An ambulance was immediately called to transport Ye to the Gongji Hospital for treatment, but he died shortly after. A search of the room revealed a suicide note and an empty bottle of poison among the scattered items. The room was filled with the pungent smell of medicine. The deceased wrote in his suicide note: "Before the age of thirty, I have experienced all the hardships of life. My stubborn mother opposes my marriage, causing me to become disheartened, leading to unemployment, and all kinds of oppression, causing me to make bad friends." He also wrote: "Tang Wenzhan has no profession and lives by receiving stolen goods. He used the Triad gang to force me to death," and so on. Further investigation revealed that the deceased's home was bare. His elderly mother was over sixty years old and paralyzed, unable to move. It is speculated that the cause of his suicide was due to his unsuccessful marriage, unemployment, and association with bad friends, resulting in excessive spending and financial ruin, leading him to consider suicide. The body was transported to the morgue for autopsy in the afternoon, 　and no one came to claim the body. Fortunately, the sub-landlord 　Qiyong, remembering his fellow hometown ties, sought help from fellow townsmen in Shanghai to provide a coffin and burial.</p>

<h3>Heavy Artillery Fire in Shenyang - Communist Bandits' "Seventh Offensive" Intends to Attack Jinzhou</h3>
<p>[Airmail from Shenyang on the 3rd by our correspondent] The Northeast, covered by thick snow and ice, has been hit by the Northeast Communist bandits' "Seventh Offensive." It is said that the Communist bandits call this offensive "a new one." During this freezing period, it is as if a gale is sweeping up sand and dust. Industry, mining, transportation, property, and life are declining and suffocating under the control of war and severe cold. This</p>
<p>war's beginning</p>
<p>was on December 12th, when the Communist bandit Li Yunchang's forces destroyed the Daling River railway bridge between Jinzhou and Goubangzi on the Beining Railway, and attacked several stations along that section, causing the recently restored Ping-Shen through train service to operate only three trains from Shenyang and two trains reaching Shenyang from Beiping. Subsequently, the service went from sectional operation to complete suspension.</p>
<p>The Liaobei bandits' 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 6th, and 10th Columns, from places like Xi'an and Xifeng on the Pingmei Road, crossed the China Changchun Railway and gathered at Zhouyuan in Faku on the north bank of the Liao River, pointing towards Shenyang from the northwest. The Liaonan bandits' 4th Column, from the southeast, moved along the "Liaogong" and "Pan'an" railways, dividing into two groups heading towards Liaoyang and Sujiatun, attempting to threaten Shenyang from the south. This time, the bandits adopted a tactic of infiltration and creating gaps, seeking to capture</p>
<p>the core - Shenyang</p>
<p>In addition, there were two other objectives: one was to isolate Kaiyuan and eliminate the Kaiyuan garrison led by Zhou Fucheng, and the other was to attack the Liao Yaoxiang corps in the northwest region of Shenyang.</p>
<p>However, the 6th Division of the bandits' 2nd Column suffered a major loss first in a village called Shahousuo, 15 kilometers southeast of Faku. They were wiped out by the Liao corps. Subsequently, the Kaiyuan Zhou Fucheng's forces were able to break through the bandits' encirclement and blockade, making a strategic retreat. The majority withdrew from Kaiyuan and turned to defend Tieling and Shenyang.</p>
<p>At this time, the bandits were constantly engaging the National Army in the area west of Tieling, east of Xinmin, and south of Faku, and used a portion of their forces to cross the frozen Liao River along the highway from Faku to Shenyang, attacking the key point of Shifosi on the south bank. The vanguard even detoured south.</p>
<p>The bandits' plan</p>
<p>was to capture Zhangwu in the northwest corner of Shenyang and Xinlitun on the west side, and then attack the core. Therefore, they were using the 7th Column to attack Zhangwu fiercely, and the 8th Column to besiege Xinlitun, so they would not have to worry about the rear.</p>
<p>The National Army was firmly defending these two strongholds in order to delay the bandits' plan to seize the core. By the evening of the 28th, Zhangwu was finally captured by the bandits due to their intense artillery fire, and the bandits intensified their pressure on Shenyang.</p>
<p>On the 27th and 28th, the main force of the 3rd and 6th Columns of the northern bandits approached the western suburbs of Shenyang. The bandits' 4th Column on the southern route, except for leaving a portion to harass "Shilihe" and "Shahe" north of Liaoyang and "Sujiatun" south of Shenyang, mostly fled west, reaching the area east of Xinmin on the Beining Railway line, attempting to join forces with the northern bandits and attack Shenyang.</p>
<p>On the 28th, after the sun went down, the bandits began to</p>
<p>bombard</p>
<p>the "Yuhong District" in the western suburbs of Shenyang with mortars, and some shells landed in the "Tiexi District." At the same time, a small group of bandits reached the "Yuhong District." The National Army fired their guns and cannons, and the bandits were repelled in the middle of the night, which was the bandits' first attempt to tentatively attack the urban area.</p>
<p>At this time, Shenyang appeared somewhat tense. Peasants from the western, northern, and southern suburbs were mostly entering the city with carts, horses, and belongings of women and children to take refuge. The price of food and daily necessities in Shenyang was also soaring. The poor also started to loot food during this period, but eventually subsided one after another.</p>
<p>The bandit army approaching the western suburbs of Shenyang could only continue to</p>
<p>attack and harass</p>
<p>and gradually retreated and moved away. There were three reasons: first, Shenyang was prepared and the tentative attack was repelled; second, the air force dispatched large numbers of aircraft on the 29th, making it difficult for subsequent troops and ammunition to be reinforced on the snow-covered road.</p>
<p>Another reason was that the National Army fought a strategic battle in a village called "Wanjintai," 35 kilometers northwest of Shenyang. It was a village with scattered houses and complex terrain, which was conducive to attack but difficult to defend. The National Army stationed there was originally the designation of the 207th Division of the Youth Army, but now it was a team of new recruits from the Northeast Youth Army. On the evening of the 27th,</p>
<p>the bandits' 6th Column</p>
<p>attacked "Wanjintai." The four-month-old new recruits fought well for the first time, capturing more than a hundred bandits in one night and seizing more war spoils. After the bandits tasted the defeat, they bombarded the area with artillery fire on the night of the 28th. Houses, military personnel, and civilians were destroyed and suffered heavy casualties. The bandits also used "explosion heroes" to crawl with explosives and detonate them. By the 29th, the National Army had run out of ammunition and was completely cut off from reinforcements. Except for a few wounded soldiers who escaped from the pile of corpses after the bandits retreated, the two battalions of more than 1,200 men were completely sacrificed. Regiment Commander Cai Yue died in battle, Battalion Commander Hu Xiufeng died in battle, and Battalion Commander Li Xiugu was seriously injured and his whereabouts are unknown. The walls collapsed, the houses crumbled, and the villagers who could not walk were almost either dead or injured. There were even more bandit corpses outside the walls and beside the houses.</p>
<p>Due to this tragic battle, the bandit's plan to make Shenyang fully experience</p>
<p>the artillery fire</p>
<p>was shattered. At the same time, the bandits had to abandon their first plan and implement the next step of attacking Jinzhou.</p>
<p>On New Year's Eve of 1947, Shenyang was relieved. The bandit masses gathered in the northwest region of Shenyang mostly turned to Dahushan and Jinzhou. The beginning of 1948 was almost the end of the Communist bandits' Seventh Offensive. Jinzhou may be the victim of the finale! (Special Correspondent Han Qingtao)</p>

<h3>Tragedy for Taiwanese Province Supervisor on New Year's Eve; Slices Open Abdomen in Suicide, Blood Splatters on Ceiling</h3>
<p>[Our Taipei Office, 6th Air Dispatch] Zhang Dequan, a supervisor at the Chiayi engineering section of the Provincial Railway Administration, committed suicide by cutting open his abdomen on New Year's Eve in a gruesome manner. After cutting his abdomen with a sharp blade, blood splattered on the ceiling and covered his body. The man was from Hunan Province, in his thirties, and had worked as a supervisor on various railway lines in the interior during the Anti-Japanese War. He was usually quiet and reserved. Because his salary was meager, he was unable to support his family. Recently, he received a letter from his hometown stating that his wife was planning to remarry.

In his suicide note, he only requested to be buried as a civil servant of the Railway Administration, stating, "Everything requires money, and without money, one can only commit suicide." It is noted that he is the third provincial civil servant to commit suicide due to low wages since the restoration of Taiwan.</p>

<p>Regarding the government's purchase of cotton, I have repeatedly stated that it will not hinder the position or interests of cotton merchants. Recently, due to the urgency of the situation, it is necessary to find ways to rush-purchase domestic cotton from various producing areas, so the China Spinning and Construction Company is temporarily entrusted to handle it on behalf of the government, in order to concentrate efforts and facilitate management, and it will not affect the business of the original cotton merchants in any way. Cotton merchants can still contact the China Spinning and Construction Company themselves to purchase cotton, which is no different from selling to the committee separately. The points of contention raised by the cotton merchants at the meeting reported yesterday are completely misunderstood. As for the purchase price, it will be handled according to the current market price, which is the fairest and most reasonable method. There is no more reasonable price than the market price. I hope that all cotton merchants in the city will not misunderstand and act emotionally in the event of any incident.</p>
<h3>Rayon Rises Wildly</h3>
<p>The surge in rayon prices continued unabated, with the market creating a new record yesterday. 120-count Asahi brand rayon opened at 20 million yuan in the morning, and the noon closing price for forward delivery was 21 million yuan, with 3.5 million yuan for deferred delivery. The situation was even more frantic in the afternoon, with the highest price reaching 35 million yuan. Many sold off at high prices, causing the price to retreat slightly. The final transaction price was 27 million yuan, with the asking price being 9 million yuan higher, an increase of 17 million yuan from the previous day.</p>
<h3>Golden Needles Soar</h3>
<p>Due to the limited stock of golden needles, the production price in the producing area has risen repeatedly. The market price here has also soared, with an increase of more than 30% before and after. High-quality goods are close to 7 customs units, while lower quality goods vary.</p>

<h3>The Root of the Problem</h3>
<p>— Bo Yong</p>
<p>Zhu Guangqian's article "Socrates in China" in the second volume, sixth issue of the literary magazine reveals the difference between scholars and ordinary superficial observers. The Socrates in this "dialogue" is naturally Zhu himself speaking his own mind. Zhu himself leans heavily toward idealism, and influenced by Croce's formal aesthetics, he specializes in solving problems from a psychological and philosophical perspective. "Literary Psychology" is his representative work.</p>
<p>In the article, the failure of modern Chinese politics and the suffering of the people are attributed to the lack of a systematic philosophy or metaphysics, as in ancient Greece for Europe and America. As a result, the thinking of the Chinese people is only fragmentary individualism, without a consistent theory to lead them on the path of collectivism and struggle. These words are indeed reasonable and well-founded, and point out the shortcomings of the Chinese people.</p>
<p>However, to say that all of China's failures stem from the lack of philosophy is something I can never believe. What is the so-called Eastern spiritual civilization, which even the foreign devil philosophers Schopenhauer and Nietzsche were fascinated by? Isn't it our ancestors' "that which is above form is called the Way?" From the philosophers of the pre-Qin period to the neo-Confucianism of the Song, Yuan, and Ming dynasties, which point and which person was not metaphysical? Zhu said: Although this is philosophy, it is not as systematic as in Europe, and it is arranged after much thought. We certainly do not have a very thorough study of European Greek philosophy, but to say that none of the Chinese schools of thought are systematic is something I cannot believe. Modern people's compilations of academic history and philosophical history clearly list the thoughts of the pre-Qin philosophers in an orderly manner: ontology, theory of human nature, political theory, moral theory, etc. If we put some thought into organizing them, it would probably not be difficult to find a beginning and an end for each. Moreover, works such as those of Mozi are themselves very systematic. On the other hand, many Western philosophies are also based on dialogues and records, not created all at once.</p>
<p>In my opinion, it is better to say that China has too much philosophy than to say that China has no philosophy! Fifteen years ago, when the construction of a China-based culture was being highly advocated, some people advocated "complete Westernization," which many people opposed. In fact, the phrase "complete Westernization" has some problems and should be changed to "modernization," that is, "scientification." The biggest change in Westerners' lives lies not in their ancient philosophy, but in the fundamental changes in the mode of production after the Industrial Revolution. If machines had not been invented, we dare to say that Socrates and Plato would not have been able to defeat China. China could still close its doors and be an emperor, calling itself alone and diminished. Some people wonder why China's social economy has stagnated in manual production for so long. In fact, the stage of manual production in Europe was also long. China is only about two hundred years behind. However, science is different from philosophy. Philosophy is timeless, while science is constantly changing. After being baptized by Watt, Newton, Edison, Nobel, Einstein, an old society of thousands of years had a sudden change, and it is changing every day, every moment. Missing one step means that you can't catch up, and missing two hundred years is even worse.</p>
<p>Blindly believing in science may have problems, such as war and the lack of depth in American culture. However, this is because humans have not made good use of it. Just as fire can be used to drive cars and ships, it can also raze tall buildings to the ground. Giving up eating because of choking is always wrong. A country that can invade others at least proves that it is too energetic to conquer, unlike our acquired maladjustment. In the Qin and Han dynasties, China did have such glory. In fact, it was not that China conquered others with culture, but that it had improved its war tools and methods that it was able to win. After the victory, our culture would naturally follow. This accumulation of power was because China had embarked on the path of agricultural production, and its wealth and power far exceeded those of the Xiongnu and the Western Regions. Therefore, after a great chaos, the people were exploited by tyranny and became unable to produce, which inevitably led to a great decline in national power, as in the Song and Ming dynasties. Those who talk about philosophy always like to mystify these things, but in fact they are extremely simple. If China had Watt in the 17th century, Edison in the 19th century, and Einstein and Marconi Curie in the 20th century, we can guarantee that it would not be like this today. External invasions would not have been able to defeat us so disastrously. When the granaries are full, honesty prevails, and corruption and illegality are no longer a problem. Today's corrupt elements all understand the law, and none of them do not understand the principle of "when the skin is gone, what will the hair cling to?" The reason they still do it is simply because they are poor.</p>
<p>Greece is the homeland of philosophy, but Greece today is a chaotic country, and there are many corrupt officials. This is enough to illustrate the uselessness of philosophy. During the American Civil War, the people were in poverty, and there was also corruption. However, once life improved, it ended immediately. At this time, it seems that we don't have so much energy to talk about Socrates and Kant. It is more important to find ways to produce food, restore transportation, and improve life.</p>
<h3>The Affection of Flesh and Blood</h3>
<p>— Jing Wen</p>
<p>Not long ago, the winter relief association used several large trucks to search for refugees in various places. However, according to reports, many refugees were unwilling to enter the shelters. Even when forced to enter, they tried to escape when people were not paying attention. Thus, the shelter seemed to be no longer a charitable organization, but rather resembled a concentration camp to some extent. There was food to eat, clothes to keep warm, houses to live in, and work to do, without costing you a penny. Where could you find such a good place? "How can we get tens of millions of houses, to shelter all the poor people of the world and make them happy?" Now that there are houses, the poor people are unwilling to "condescend," preferring to sleep in the streets, with disheveled hair and bare feet, enduring hunger and cold, and being baptized by wind and snow. This is truly puzzling.</p>
<p>But the actual situation is just the opposite. The wanderers on the streets are not born with cheap bones. The large number of refugees forced by the fires of war to migrate to Shanghai are not all single men. Wives, children, parents, and old and young alike have all endured hardships and escaped famine together. Now, those who are fortunate enough to have the strength to work or are young are sent to the shelters, leaving behind their families, parents, brothers, wives, and children. Wouldn't it be even harder to pass the time? The affection of flesh and blood is deep. Even if one person's stomach is not hungry and one person's body is not cold, how can they bear to see their children helpless and starving, their parents without adequate food and clothing, and heading towards death, and still live peacefully in the shelters!</p>
<p>"Carp in a dry rut moisten each other with saliva." Only the poor know the suffering of the poor. Sharing weal and woe is the supreme virtue of mankind, and it is also the expression of mankind's greatest love and affection. Only animal-like humans who have lost their humanity, in their eyes, these ungrateful refugees, who are unwilling to enjoy the benefits readily available, are truly the number one fools in the world.</p>
<h3>Waves Wash the Sand</h3>
<p>— Gu Fei</p>
<p>Wen Feng's Another Trip to America Frosty Moon Turns at the Window, Cold. I wake from wine, the lamp is dim, long and short pavilions outside ten thousand layers of mountains… Shaking hands in the wind, a thousand words, forgetting to add a meal. Leaning on the railing to look far away, the leaves are mottled, the colorful clouds have wings to fly back. Do not say that life is easy to part, what is difficult to meet again!</p>
<h3>The Art of Speaking</h3>
<p>— Jing Wen</p>
<p>As the saying goes, "illness enters through the mouth, and trouble comes from the tongue." The former is a scientific statement, and the latter is an experiential statement. Although illness does not necessarily enter through the mouth, trouble coming from the tongue is a profound saying. Often, what you say carelessly unintentionally offends others. A great man's words can build a country, but they can also destroy a country. Old novels often have the saying "a great man's words once spoken cannot be overtaken by a team of horses," which further illustrates the importance of a person's words. Even in the so-called "world of hoodlums," the saying of "making a point" is quite important, because even though it's "a point," it usually means you have to "shoulder the responsibility."</p>
<p>People who are good at speaking always take advantage of others. For example, when you see two people arguing on the street, the one who gesticulates is always the one who ultimately gains the sympathy of the onlookers, while the other one, red-faced and stammering, although full of reason, has difficulty attracting the attention of the audience.</p>
<p>However, being good at speaking does not necessarily mean understanding the art of speaking. Because being good at speaking sometimes inevitably invites frivolous comments, especially in public places, saying too many trivial things often turns oneself into a clown. Moreover, "trouble comes from the tongue," that is, saying too much invites trouble.</p>
<p>People who understand the art of speaking, although not necessarily good at speaking, always speak appropriately. Language is originally a medium for conveying meaning. If words fail to convey meaning, even if you are good at eloquence, you will ultimately fail to gain the respect of others. Therefore, the key to the art of speaking lies mainly in appropriate vocabulary. And appropriate vocabulary is related to personal cultivation and experience.</p>
<p>The most difficult place to speak is probably social situations, because most of the people you meet there are strangers. After the host gives you a simple introduction, you have to find a topic yourself and try to keep the conversation going, otherwise you will inevitably find yourself in an awkward situation. The "parties" that are popular among middle and upper-class families are a suitable place to practice social conversation.</p>
<p>The conversation between a couple is the most "romantic" and the most private. Only the parties involved understand such conversations, and the meaning of the conversation is often fleeting and cannot be recalled afterwards. You may already have a wife, but do you still remember the conversations you had with her when you were courting her?</p>
<p>Writing novels and making movies, the most difficult scene is to describe the conversation between a couple. When you see the line "Sister, I love you" in a novel or hear the unbearable dialogue "I love you, what's wrong?" in a domestic movie, you will only feel nauseous, which is definitely not the true picture of when you were expressing your love to her or him.</p>
<p>The attitude of speaking is also an important part of the art of speaking. Frankness and sincerity are two conditions that make speaking powerful. But the extent to which one should be frank depends on the speaker's own identity and the other party's position. Everyone says that they like frankness, which may be true, but there is one condition, that is, being frank to the point that it makes the listener uncomfortable, then it loses its elegance.</p>
<p>However, sincerity is necessary. Even if it is excessive frankness, if it is expressed with a sincere attitude, it can always impress the listener and not diminish their good feelings towards you.</p>
<p>The above is the art of speaking from the perspective of worldly experience, which is naturally full of hypocrisy. However, since you and I live in this world full of hypocrisy, how can we avoid it!</p>
<p>The most pleasant, most poetic, and most genuine conversation should be the conversation between two or three good friends over a cup of wine, because only in this situation, your words have no considerations of self-interest, nor a specific purpose, but are just for the sake of talking. In this situation, although the words are often incoherent, sometimes simply nonsensical, at the time you don't remember where the topic came from, and afterwards you forget everything completely. However, it is precisely this selfless talk that is the essence of speaking, and the poetic realm of speaking.</p>
<h3>Tea Talk</h3>
<p>— Yi Tsun</p>
<p>I accidentally "rescued" a handwritten copy of "Separate Records on Boiling Tea" written by the master of the Tea Fragrance Room from a second-hand stall. The fabrication is shoddy and vulgar, so I thought I would say a few words about "tea."</p>
<p>Except for the first person who poured water into tea leaves and drank it to quench his thirst, who was a genius, the rest of humanity can be said to be "tea slaves." But tea was finally developed and expanded, not only becoming the "national drink," but also one of the few domestic products that my country exports.</p>
<p>Not only is drinking ordinary good tea, but the set of rituals described in the "Classic of Tea" can also bring out the function of tea. The true taste of tea is expressed in that half-drink, momentary, much laughed at, moment, when you have traveled long distances or worked until you are exhausted and your throat is parched. Expensive leaves, elaborate tea sets, extravagant cooking, leisurely mood, pretentious tasting, discriminating, [missing characters], this is just a plaything for the leisure class. In my opinion, the most difficult drinking of tea is in the homes of rural people, when they scoop a bowl of boiling tea from a rough jar and give it to you. That is truly a confidant of tea. They also have a humorous saying: "Our house may be small, but the tea leaves are very big!" It truly has a natural feeling.</p>
<h3>Words of a Hero</h3>
<p>— And Then</p>
<p>General Patton, the famous American general, was the hero who landed in Normandy and went straight to Berlin in the Second World War. His military tactics were so brilliant that they repeatedly exceeded the estimates of Marshal Eisenhower. His illustrious achievements will last forever. Unexpectedly, he died in Europe in a car accident a few years ago, which meant America lost one of its bravest military geniuses! He kept a diary during the war, and reading it makes one feel his heroic spirit is palpable. Now, a section is extracted to continue the narrative.</p>
<p>"July 28, 1944. I received a verbal order from General Bradley, appointing me as the commander of the Third Army, and received initial operational instructions. On the 29th, I immediately went to the front line of Goulles for inspection. I saw an entire armored brigade concentrated there, standing still. When I walked to the command post hidden behind a church, I found everyone busy studying maps. I asked them why they hadn't crossed the Seine River yet. They said they were currently studying the problem and didn't know where to force a crossing. I asked them if they had made any progress. They said they still had to look at the terrain. I told them that before going to the command post, I had already tried to cross it. The river was only two feet deep, and the enemy's defense was only a machine gun, which had been shooting at me for a long time, but the aiming was really too poor, simply firing randomly. I told them a Far Eastern proverb: 'Seeing once is better than hearing a hundred times.' Then I scolded them, asking why they didn't dare to try to cross. After this lesson, they became an extremely elite force.</p>
<p>"After dinner on the 31st, I went to inspect the headquarters of the Eighth Division on the right wing of our army. The division commander, Middleton, greeted me happily, because his troops had successfully reached the destination, Selune River. He asked for instructions on future actions. I told him that in the history of warfare, those who don't cross the river will be defeated, so he should cross the river immediately. We immediately discussed the method of building a bridge near Pontaubault to cross the river. Suddenly, the phone rang. According to the front report, although the bridge on the Selune River was damaged, it was still usable! Hearing this news, I was overjoyed. This was a good omen for the Third Army. At this moment, I heard that the Fourth Armored Brigade had captured the water gate east of the bridge, capturing four thousand enemies, which was extremely gratifying. In the march, I often heard that something was impossible to do; but in fact, it was done. The Eighth Division and the Fifteenth Division's crossing of Avranches achieved what was said to be an impossible task. I certainly knew that using troops in this way was extremely dangerous, but how could I be afraid of everything first!"</p>
<h3>Carefree Flower</h3>
<p>— Chen Shenyan</p>
<p>Chapter Six: Such a Wonderful Evening (36)</p>
<p>Qi Wan was above this ten-thousand-foot cliff, in a dangerous situation. Zhu Zhai's words "I'm sorry" reached her ears, and she felt a slight tug in her heart. Immediately, her thoughts shifted. She sat up, walked to the washbasin, turned on the tap, filled a basin with cold water, wrung out a cold towel, wiped her face, and then wrung it out again and handed it to him, saying, "Zhu, wipe your face too." Although Zhu Zhai was exercising great restraint, in this quiet night, facing such a beautiful woman, and seeing Qi Wan so devoted and considerate to him, he couldn't help but feel a sense of kinship. His heart was a little restless. Qi Wan saw that he wasn't saying anything and couldn't help but turn around and smile, "What are you thinking about again? Why aren't you talking?" Zhu Zhai said, "I want to ask you a question." Qi Wan said seriously, "What question?" Zhu Zhai said, "I'm asking you: Can you wait for me?" Qi Wan said, "What about your wife?" Zhu Zhai said, "I'll divorce her!" Qi Wan nodded slightly and said, "I'll wait for you; even if you don't divorce, I'll wait for you!" Seeing her say it so firmly, Zhu Zhai couldn't help but step forward and tightly grasp Qi Wan's hand. Their eyes met, as if they had reached an extremely sweet and perfect state. They silently stared at each other, unable to say a word, only hearing the ticking of the clock on the wall and the rustling of the wind outside the window. In a moment, the glass window revealed a fish-belly white color; dawn had broken. The two leaned against each other, a surge of passion burning in their hearts. It seemed that they had a lot to say, but in the intertwining of joy and sorrow, they couldn't say it. At that moment, two rapid rings of the doorbell sounded outside. Xiao Wang Ma quickly rushed out to open the door. In the blink of an eye, someone was heard speaking in the courtyard. Zhu Zhai was surprised and wanted to ask who it was. Xiao Wang Ma had already run into the room, shouting in the outer room, "Boss, the master is here." Zhu Zhai felt that it was really inappropriate to be seen in Qi Wan's bedroom at this time, and he awkwardly asked, "Your brother is here, how can I see him!" Qi Wan quickly grabbed a piece of clothing, put it on, took Zhu Zhai's hand, and said, "It's okay, let's go out together to see my brother!" Zhu Zhai was ashamed and timidly walked out of the bedroom with Qi Wan. He saw Qi Wan's brother, Gu Hezhou, standing in the center of the room. Hezhou's face showed a slight surprise when he saw Qi Wan and Zhu Zhai come out together, but it immediately recovered. Qi Wan pointed to Zhu Zhai and said, "This is my good friend, Mr. Xu Zhu Zhai. He came to help me pack my luggage and didn't sleep all night. I've really troubled him!" Hezhou glanced at Zhu Zhai, a slight smile on the corner of his mouth, and said, "Okay, okay, you're tired. Qi Wan, have you prepared everything you should bring? We'll be at the station in half an hour." Qi Wan said, "I've prepared almost everything I should bring. Brother, you take the luggage first. We'll meet at the station." Hezhou nodded, glanced at Zhu Zhai, and went out. After Hezhou left, Xiao Wang Ma came into the room to serve Qi Wan and Zhu Zhai with washing up and breakfast and packed up odds and ends. After busying for a while, the time had come. Qi Wan repeatedly told Xiao Wang Ma to take care of the house carefully and to remember to feed Xiao Mimi (the cat). "If I come back and she's hungry, I won't be happy." Xiao Wang Ma smiled and agreed. Then Qi Wan and Zhu Zhai got into the car and hurried to the station. Zhu Qi saw that there were many of Qi Wan's colleagues and people seeing her off on the platform at the station, so he couldn't say much. He just privately exhorted her a few words and watched her board the train. The train started, Qi Wan looked out the window, waving a silk scarf. Zhu Zhai also raised his hat and waved goodbye. Watching the train leave the station, he couldn't help but feel lost! (End of this chapter)</p>
