<h3 id="c1">翁文灝答立委質詢　說明軍財外交原則　具體問題書面個別答覆 <a href="#c1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>〔本報南京十五日電〕行政院長翁文灝，十五日晨於立法院第十二次會議中，就該院第九，第十，十一三次會議各委員關於施政方針之質詢，以口頭致討，作總答覆。翁氏首對各委員之指正表示感激，決盡力注意施政方針之改良及切實執行，並曾　答覆開端及末尾兩度聲明，此項總答覆係與各部會首長會商後決定，注重於重大原則之解釋，另外具體問題，則將以書面陸續作各別答覆。渠稱：施政方針乃行憲政院就職之初擬就之施政方向，其計劃細節，則將附於預算中提出。</p>
<h3 id="c2">改善待遇加緊訓練　澄清役政征募兼施　國防部組織法正研究修正 <a href="#c2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>軍事方面：一·如何確立國防軍事制度，國防部組織法，正在研究修正，一俟起草完成，即當向立法院提出，但在比戡亂時期，軍事行動極關重要，此事已由總統核定，國防部修正組織基本原則，其中規定「國防部長負軍事政策及行政責任，參謀總長爲統帥之慕僚長及國防部長之行政官，負軍事業務之計與與指導責任」。「參謀總長對軍令事宜，以奉總統之命令行之，對軍政事宜，以部長命令行之，或以奉部長諭行之」。</p>
<p>二·如何增强華北，華中戰力，（一）團結人心，振作士氣，　當指揮，加緊訓練，充實裝備。（二）改善待遇，嚴明賞罰，充分補給優秀部隊。（三）配給械彈，加緊訓練，以扶助地方武力之建立及强化。三·如何補充人力，籌備軍糧，爲應付共匪之日益擴大，不得不征兵，唯戶籍不淸，保甲長亦難免擾民，今後決加强機構，澄淸役政，同時並則募兵辦法，征募兼施，以廣兵源。並儘力改善士兵待遇，至年需四千萬擔之軍糧之籌揹，爲免購買增加發行，亦唯有繼續征糧，現糧部正積極督促所屬消除積弊。</p>
<h3 id="c3">改革幣制將擬方案　國營事業發股票　外交方面促蘇履行條約 <a href="#c3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>財政經濟方面：戡亂時期軍費支出浩繁，普通預算固可望其平衡，特別預算勢必不敷，爲增開財源，除將請由立院協助增加稅收外，將以國營事業一部出售增加收入。改革幣制牽涉太多，決盡力擬訂妥善辦法，於最短期間由負責當局延致專家，完成研究與準備，擬具方案提請立院召開秘密會議，共商進行。平抑物價，以往拋售物資，緊縮發行之辦法仍將繼續，同時發行國營事業股票，流通美援物資，發行庫券，增加生產，加强出口等辦法均將運用，以安定後方人民生活。</p>
<p>外交方面：中蘇疆界極長，關係至要，我於中蘇條約雖付出很大代價，蘇聯亦負很多義務，如我忠實信守不渝，蘇聯亦須履行義務，故中蘇關係之猶待改善，實非條約錯誤，而是未予履行。一我曾就蘇聯不切實履行條約屢次交涉抗議，今後仍將堅守立塲，繼續求取解決，決不辱國。至日本問題，我方對策爲防止日軍重起侵略及防止日本赤化，此與美國持同一立塲，對要求賠償一事，政院設有賠償委會負專責，詳細賠償計劃，經交外部轉飭駐東京及華府代表切實執行，從未忽視。</p>
<p>翁氏承認各委員所指責政治上暮氣太深，效率過差之不良現象並說明其原因在於用人牽涉太多，然渠實具有精忠報國之信心，雖困難重重，而缺乏相應必需之能爲，亦決心努力打開現局，盼立院在法制與事實上予以支持，於戡亂大目標下集中力量，完成任務。最後渠並誠摯聲述施政方針起莫時決無故倡高論之心，今後將擬訂進程，循序執行，至祈各委員仍多指敎，同心協力，共負艱鉅。</p>

<h3 id="c6">本年下半年度　財政收入預算　共約五百四十餘萬億 <a href="#c6" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e6" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">6</a></h3>
<p>〔本報南京十五日電〕本年下半年國家財政收入預算，財部已編製完竣，送呈政院。全部收入預算共爲五百四十餘萬億元，其中稅收共三百萬億，其他收入爲二百四十餘萬億。稅收部份三百萬億之分配，仍以貨物稅爲第一，較本年上半年預算增加十倍，計一百萬億元，關稅第二，計七十餘萬億元，其他各稅預算，亦均較本年上半年之預算增加八借至十倍不等。其中以印花稅預算較上半年預算增加最多，爲十二倍，直接稅之預算亦達四十餘萬億元，此項稅收預算之數字，係王雲五與各稅務機構負責人個別商定者，雖事實上能否達到預期尙不可知，但王雲五已一再勉勵各稅務機構負責人，應努力達到預算上所列之數字。</p>
<p>另悉：財部對各稅之稅率將予以改進，關·鹽稅之稅率，均將加以調整。同時，對於征收時之手續亦將儘量簡化改善，問政院對於財部所列下半年之收入預算，認爲尙稱滿意，亦盼能切實執行。至支出之預算。正由主計部編制中，其數額仍超過收入預算之總和。</p>
<p>〔本報南京十五日電〕財部十五日下午三時舉行部務會議，各次長及署長，司長等均出席，王雲五致詞，勉勵坩加稅收，並希各同仁分層負責，各書其本位職務。外傳王雲五已提出辭呈，有關方面十五日已指出並非事實。</p>

<h3 id="c25">從機器業的困難說起 <a href="#c25" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e25" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">25</a></h3>
<p>外匯改制之初，當局對於生產器材部份，傳有大量或全部開放，准許以自備外匯採辦入口的擬議，本報即嘗著論予以贊揚。良以是項器材爲一切工業之母，一部份進口機器，以附件不易配到，致無法加以運用，尚有一部份已經定妥之機器，以無法人口爲藉口，竟在香港設廠開工，爲維護民族工業，促進國內生產起見，獎勵生產器材入口，自是十分合理的。</p>
<p>但在生產器材缺乏與歡迎外貨入口聲中，間時有一矛盾的現象，却也不得不予以深切的注意，即本市機器業瀕於絕境是。據傳該業廠家，大小約九百所，母機達二萬架，工人約六萬名，以工業衰落，尤其是紡織業紛紛緊縮或南遷之故，其製成品銷　呆滯，積貨太多，竟陷於非常困難的境地。這當有下列各項理由可以解釋：</p>
<p>（一）所謂生產器材，種類甚少，有些部門，國內無法製造，不得不採辦外貨，而同時其他部門，却以上述理由，形成生產過剩的景象。</p>
<p>（二）原來進口的機器，國內無法配備，其附件仍須仰給國外。</p>
<p>（三）自有一類廠商，對於外國機器的信任，遠過於國產品，寗可捨近就遠，購買外國貨。</p>
<p>我們以爲以上（一）（二）兩項，係易事實問題，應當假以時日，由機器業逐步改進，設法解決外，其現在可以代替的國產成品，國家應當切實代爲提倡，開拓其銷路，以解救其目前的困難，並以培養此國內僅有的基本工業。其辦法爲：1國營工廠，應儘先採用國貨以資提們，2其申請輸入生產器材時，凡有國產可以代用的，即予以從嚴刪剔，3勸令民營工廠採用國貨。</p>
<p>從前有一位車輛製造商，其產品相當精良，後來雖經官商各方而陸續採用，但其勸請他們採辦試用時，據說，其經過十分吃力，亦十分痛苦。去年某地的國產機車，好容易設法造成了，結果好像亦沒有人理睬。照這一類例子看來，可知萌芽時期的機器業，其發展確非易易。但在這成品呆擱，無法維特的時候，大家應當從遠一步着想，共同維護這偶脆弱的基礎，藉以發展國產，减少失業，並减少外匯資金的浪費。</p>
<p>據傳勝利以來，該業的出品，以供應紡織業爲多。本年三月間，經濟部所召集的紡織機器製造會議，原有一年半內製造紗錠二十萬枚，與布機七千臺的計劃。所望此項計劃，能够切實推進，同時，紡管會改以增加生產為重心，勿再縛頭縛脚，使廠商望而却步，則不但機器業的困難不難予以解除，即紡織業的前途，亦何難回復其原有的繁榮景况。現在紡管會聞又有改制之議，我們以爲單是變更組織，改換名稱，掉動人員，其實並無多大效用，不如改變政策，注重增產。替廠家切實解除困難、不要一味增加他們的東縛，方與翁院長施政　吿內所說加强生產，用最有效的辦決，平抑物價各簡度幾稍能相符。</p>
<p>翁院長並說到囤積居奇，逃避資金，政府正在商討對策，這自然是大家熱切盼望的一事。不過就生產器材這一點而論，倒是一而積貨太多，無法行銷，而一而則又以採辦外洋器材　工廠南遷的方式，任令火量資金，逃向國外。我們於此，實在不得不籲請政府，對於上面所述各項補救辦法，予以迅連推行，以配合當前的國策。</p>
<p>翁院長很顧慮到通貨膨脹的危險，認爲國庫如果不能增加收入，勢必增發通貨，市塲非崩潰不可，好像通貨膨脹的現象，以後頗有終止的希望。這自然又是大家所樂問的事。但不知他對於貸款的方針，有沒有根本的變更？如果然從舊貫，仍從定貨購貨入手，則我們要求，對於產品滯銷，而又與國民經濟關係極密切的國產器材，至少應與日用必需品同樣考慮。愼勿以目前無利可圖，而就　棄勿問。因爲國家行局之所以承做貸款，原以增加生產與扶助工業爲重心，自未必祗以變相囤貨，只知謀利爲目的。生產器材旣是一切工業的基本，其所需要的貸款又較鉅，其期間亦較長，非國家行局出來支持，恐該業即將陷於總崩潰。如果國家行局對此機器工業的危機，坐視不顧，恐怕也未必是「以人民的利益爲利益」的適當措施吧！</p>

<p>〔本報重慶十五日電〕楊森市長確信楊妹不食，按照渠原有計劃，擬派醫務人員陪伴楊妹遄返鄂都原籍繼續考騐，並對楊妹原籍環境如草水等，作深入研究。渠深感楊妹之特殊生理機構，可能影嚮壽命，故覓一適合楊妹起居地點，爲研究前之最先條件，嗣因鄂都及石柱不靖，恐遭歹徒搶刧，或生意外，致擱淺迄今。楊妹現居渝市，渠義不容辭，應爲楊妹之監護人，外間不明眞相，揣測頗多，渠女楊萬運頃在京金大肄業，近由京來函稱：「親愛的爸爸，京報常談到你對楊妹的意見，有些當然不大好，希望你能稍小心，以免無中生有的諷刺。不過楊妹的事究竟如何，我也不大淸楚，希望你能吿訴我一些。」楊氏述此，妙語橫生，充份顯露渠軍人之豪爽坦白個性，因爲楊妹是個女人，渠對此不食之謎又決心研究到底，渠夫人亦曾勸吿國家大事都管不完，何必要操這個心？惟楊妹之謎一日不揭開，渠絕對不會作罷，渠對卓松岱對楊妹之居奇態度，亦表不滿。渠曾陪伴夫人探視楊妹，楊妹當面報吿他要回家，詢及原因，始答他回家後可將一鷄一猪變賣，買布縫衣。楊妹雖不食，仍具有女性愛美天性，對花布，口紅，粉，皮鞋等日用化裝品一樣愛好。渠即勸伊不必操心，一切太太都可送你，但車松岱在旁隱露不快，卓之不願任何機關與楊妹有密切關係，昭然若揭。楊氏復鄭重語本報記者：渠有揭破楊妹不食之謎之責，日內即着手將楊妹由九龍坡卓寓遷至一理想的適合楊妹生活環境之所在地。楊氏單獨與本報記者研究結果，以市郊山洞林園最妥，該處有岳水可隨楊妹性之所好，遊山玩水，穿布衣，打赤脚，毫無拘束。房屋亦寬暢，可容納專家及研究人員，加之地點偏僻，即使楊妹要買東西吃，亦不可能，惟對以前所謂之監護人如張老太太，冉小姐等，則拒絕前往陪伴，楊妹對女警員及護士已熟悉，且具好感，有渠等陪伴，已可减少寂寞，否則難免漏洞，仍遭人疑惑。楊氏强調楊妹已非任何個人所可私有，伊已爲全世界科學家之研究對象，故市府負有保護之責，絕不會有損害楊妹身心之檢查事態發生。另據中正醫院長胡先文稱：研究楊妹技術委員會雖未積極進行，然渠與渝各醫院負責人有密切接觸，對楊妹次步臨床檢查已有充份準備。渠等歡迎美專家葛萊琪生及羅特等來渝，惟在渠等抵渝前，渝醫學家至少應有一初步研究結果，如血與尿的化學分析，細菌生理的各種檢隊，作爲中外專家等進一步深入研究的參考，故認爲先使楊妹遷居九龍坡卓寓，環境上實爲最善措施。技委會日內決開會，詳商步驟。一俟楊森諭示衛生局後，楊妹之次步檢查，即可因脫離以前監護人之羈絆而更臻週密矣。</p>

<p>〔合衆社華盛頓十四日電〕美國會十四日以迅速行動，於休會前最後一週中，開始將和平時期之徵兵法案，援外法案，互惠商務協定延長法案，向接近通過地步更進一步。各議員在此或爲第八十屆國會最後一週中有無成就，對一九四八年政治運動均有重大影響。杜魯門總統再番抨擊渠所稱爲「歷史第二個最壞之國會」。渠在洛山磯演說中，要求議員繼續開會直至管制物價法案及居住問題法案得解決之後，但共和黨領袖正依其自己計劃進行六月十九日休會事宜。茲列舉參衆兩院動態如下：</p>
<p>（一）衆院法規委員會勉强通過十九至廿五歲青年徴兵法案而提　衆院，衆院在休會前之通過此案，事實上已決定，參院則已通過類似之法案。</p>
<p>（二）參院通過並交回衆院一項法案，延長互惠貿易協定一年，該案對杜魯門總統减低關稅之權力稍有限制。衆院前通過一項法案，賦予國會有否決關稅之權力，諒將接受參院之意見。</p>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓十四日電〕美國十四日採取行動，以加强其空軍實力，及維持其在國防趨向更佳世界企圖中之任務。衆院頃已通過一項法案，並將此提交參院，對設立七十大隊空軍事加以法理規定。擴展空軍之款項則早已撥付付，該案將規定設立七十正規大隊之空軍，服務人員共五十萬二千人。杜魯門總統頃已簽署陸空軍新建設之法案，規定陸軍地面部隊得以三百八十萬三千元，作爲馬利亞納羣島上居住及其他設備之需，空軍得以五百卅七萬六千美元，作爲軍營及其他設備之需。此外，另有三百六十九萬元撥爲改良菲列濱美軍營之款項。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社華盛頓十四日電〕參院撥款委會通過下一會計年度海軍經費卅八億一千二百萬美元，比較衆院批准之數額又增加一億二千五百萬元。</p>
<p>〔路透社華盛頓十四日電〕陸長羅雅爾及參謀長勃雷特萊，今日在參院撥款小組中，力請恢復陸軍預算項下經衆院所削六億元中之四億九千二百萬元。勃萊特萊强調今日之世界局勢，需要擴軍計劃，適當的國防仍爲在和平條件下生存的最好保陣。</p>
<h3 id="c48">美援外法案經費　總額六十一億餘　參院撥欵委會一致通過 <a href="#c48" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e48" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">48</a></h3>
<p>〔中央社華盛頓十四日專電〕美參院撥款委員會今一致通過總額六十一億二千五百七十萬元之援外法案，事實上已恢復衆院削减之十一億七千五百萬元。該法案明日將交參院辯論，共包括下列數種撥款：（一）歐洲復原計劃第一年實施款項現款四十億。（二）爲期十二個月之援華款項四億六千萬元，其中一億二千五百萬元指定作爲軍事援助。（三）援助希土款項二億五千萬元。（四）佔領區美軍及救濟費十三億二千五百萬元，其中一億二千五百萬元，指定作爲援助日本及朝鮮復原。（五）聯合國兒童緊急救濟基金二千萬元。（六）撥予聯合國國際難民組織七千零七十萬元。委員會主席勃里奇吿記者：渠預料該案在參院不致遭受重大反對，惟衆院人士謂：參衆兩院爲獲得折衷法案，而舉行聯合會議時，必將有一塲熱烈爭辯。</p>

<p>〔聯合社開羅十五日電〕巴勒斯坦六個半月之戰亂，昨日初見全綫沉寂。聯合國調解團正加緊努力，乘四星期停戰時期，促成阿拉伯與猶太雙方之持久和平。調解員貝那多特已在羅特島部署完成，今日飛抵開羅，與阿拉伯領袖接洽和會事宜，然後於十七日飛赴合拉維夫與以色列當局接洽。　同時，阿拉伯各國政軍領袖今晨在開羅集會，決定應付和會方針。貝氏奔走接洽第一事須決定者，爲阿猶雙方是否願至鑼特島舉行圓桌會議，截至現在爲止，雙方迄未改變態度。</p>
<p>〔路透社開羅十五日電〕此間極可靠方面人士聲稱，在未來關於巴勒斯坦之和平談判中，阿拉伯方面將建議模仿瑞土聯邦制度，在巴勒斯坦建立由若干享有極大自治權的區域合組而成的聯邦，每邦得派代表參加中央委員會。此一中央委員會，由阿拉伯族握有控制的權限，聯邦之外交事務悉由該中央委員會處理。按猶太方面前已明白表示決不接受，不使其享有充分國家主權的任何建議，故料阿拉伯方面此項建議，勢難爲猶方接受。</p>

<p>連日米價飛漲不已，吳市長國國，任主委顯羣，爲澈底撲滅漲風，穩定糧價，特於十五日下午五時，假市府會議室召集有關各方，舉行米價檢討會議。經各方縝密研討之結果，僉認米價決不能任其脫軌高翔，而有加以限制之必要，故最後決定自十六日起，依舊採取限價辦法，上白粳每石不得超過一千萬元。本市各米號，於限價辦法實施後，如有超越限價情事，市民可儘量檢舉，或予拒購。各米號於發售食米時，並需詳細紀錄購米市民之姓名住址，以防止多購囤積，而便於主管當局抽查。據悉：吳市長於會後當即將此項辦法，通知民食調配會暨警察局，米店售米如有違反情事，除由警局負責解送法院法辦外，民調會並得取消其配米資格。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕本市聯勤總部兵工署駐滬修理處工人，昨因拒購車票，與公用局公共汽車員工發生衝突後，竟在徐家匯區聚衆尋釁，搗毀公共汽車五輛，及警備車一輛，並毆傷售票員司機等十餘人。當軍警　集之時，詎該署工人等復以機槍及湯姆生搶掃射拒捕，幸目標不準，軍憲警等亦力加忍耐，未曾還擊，得未肇巨禍，實爲不幸中之大幸。該區交通自中午十二時卅分起，即吿停頓，直至晚間八時始吿恢復，所有受傷者已分送各醫院急救，內重傷兩人，恐有性命之虞。</p>
<p>昨晨六時半，有一衣藍布工裝之工人一名，乘坐行駛於曹家渡·靜安寺間之五路公共汽車上，車至中途時，有一三五號查票員以其未曾購票，向其查詢，該工人即出示「聯勤總部兵工署」臨時身份證一紙，查票員因渠並非軍人，乃請其補票，但遭拒絕，正相持中，車已停靠於靜安寺華山路口，時該署之交通車一輛適亦滿載工人，停於該處，該工人即下車至交通車上喚得同事數人，擬將此查票員曳去，致引起爭執。不數分鐘，公共汽車絡續駛至，車上司機·售票員，亦均紛紛聚集，與對方理論，事爲靜安寺警察分局得知，即派警將該署工人四名帶局，經調解後，即將渠等釋放，惟此拒購車票之工人潘立良，則爲靜安寺憲兵隊加以扣押偵訊。</p>
<p>糾集工人　在途滋事</p>
<p>此事本可吿一段落，不料被釋放之工人心有不甘，經返修理處後，即糾集工人多名，乘坐滿載石塊之十輪軍用卡一輛，於十一時左右駛至高安路附近，見有十五路脾號五四四之公共汽車一輛迎面駛來，當兩車相遇時，車上工人即不問情由將石塊向該車猛擲，一時秩序大亂，乘客紛紛逃避，幸受傷，惟該車售票員五五五號及二九〇號則被擊傷，司機七六三號頭部被石塊擲破。該軍軍見目的已達，即飛駛逸去，受傷者旋即車送紅十字會醫院治療。</p>
<p>售票司機　多人受傷</p>
<p>至十二時三十分，該處工人變本加厲，復糾集百餘人，乘坐大卡車三輛，駛至徐家匯天鎖橋附近後，即手持鐵棍，鐵錐等兇器，下車徒步分至衡山路十五路公共汽事站，及交通大學門口五路公共汽車站，將停於兩處之汽車五輛，全加搗毀，同時復將八四號簽票員更偉民及九二六號司機頭部擊破，傷勢甚重已送中山醫院急救此外七四四號司機張積渝，及五四四號售票員陳效一〇三二號陸兆安，亦遭毒毆受傷，七三號查票員龐培祥，且被擲入河中，均經送紅十字醫院治療。另有司機兩人，則被若輩行兇後，强行拖至天鎖橋登車岡逸。時靜安寺憲兵隊，警備部警備第一大隊，徐家匯警察分局及飛行堡壘，紛紛得報趕至，即將該兩司機營救下車。</p>
<p>機槍掃射　幸未肇禍</p>
<p>詎在紛亂間，徐家匯警察分局之一三三號警備車亦被搗毀，旋軍憲警追至浜南龍華路斜土路附近，竟突遭四局預架之機槍及湯姆生搶連射三四十彈，軍憲警方面驟不及防，立即臥倒躱避，一面由官長發令不准還擊，幸對方目標不準，致未肇巨禍，否則死傷定必不堪設想。嗣該批　事工人即退至龍華路前護軍使署舊址之聯勤兵工署修理廠內。</p>
<p>十九工人　被捕解辦</p>
<p>當工人等肆意搗毀車輛時，經軍憲警先後拘獲肇事者朱惠堂·胡支來·刁國賢·李維泉·洪金榮·周少春·陳介康·陳重慶·陳貴生·李金培·馮秋泉·高一鵬·蔡寳福·黃秋林·馮國璋·盛安祥·壽仁安·王根銀等十八名，現均暫行覊押於徐家匯警察分局，定今晨移解警備部嚴辦。至主犯潘立良，亦由靜安寺憲兵隊移送該部併案辦理。</p>
<p>議決四項　善後辦法</p>
<p>事後，由港口司令部參謀處長吳鐸，聯勤總部兵工署駐滬辦事處處長李國琛，警備部警備第三大隊隊長潘龍雲，靜安寺憲兵隊隊長葉菁，市警局督寮長許林海，徐家匯警察分局長張珍，公用局交通組長王總善等，開會商討善後辦法，當經決定：（一）查明肇事主從犯移解警備部嚴辦；（二）由兵工署賠償公用局車輛損失；（三）負担受傷者之醫藥費；（四）保證以後不發生同樣事件。至此次受傷者，如有因傷致死等情時，再另行開會討論。</p>
<p>此事至晚七時五十五分，始告圓滿解決，停頓幾達七小時餘之交通，亦於八時起恢復行駛。</p>
<p>事後調查，公共交通公司損失玻璃一百五十塊，票根與現款失落三千四百三十萬元及徐家匯票亭修理費五千萬元。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕同濟學潮案，被吿黃克魯，潘承邦，王宗恕，局詠之，張敬堯，孫克孖，瞿宇平，王維新等八人，被控妨害秩序罪，經高院於本月十四日判決無罪及免刑，檢察官林厚祺不服，提起上訴。其理由略謂：（一）黃克魯，潘承邦，王宗恕，孫克孖，王維新，張敬堯部份：黃潘爲同濟學潮請願團主席，而主席團爲請願隊首腦，並由該主席團發令使學生衝出校門，致使當時秩序陷於紊亂，該被告等自應負公然聚衆施强暴脅迫首謀之罪。被吿王宗恕爲常設委員會委員，被吿王維新爲請願團總指揮，均有證可稽。被吿張敬堯在警局自認手持請願旗向包圍警士前衝，當塲被捕。被吿孫克孖跨過溝來毆打吳市長，不惟朱一夫指證明確，即該被吿在警局供稱也承認對市長有不禮貌之處。此輩有共同公然聚衆下手實施强暴脅迫行爲至無疑義。原判認爲皆係特定之學生，無隨時增加之狀况，與聚衆要件不合，使如其說，則凡軍隊或工人等聚衆暴動，亦皆與聚衆要件不符，法律上見解殊欠允洽。且千餘人　是　均係學生，原判並未調查，亦屬推測。雖其犯罪行爲又觸犯妨害公務之罪名，但其妨害秩序罪實不能捨棄不論。（二）瞿宇平，周詠之部份：查被吿瞿宇平是當時毆打市長，已據證人張聚恭供明在卷。迨初審時誤指他人爲被吿，係時間過久記憶不淸之故。原判以該張聚恭與被吿素所稔識，其證言遊移不定，認爲不足採信，顯有誤會。該被吿旣有毆打吳市長之事實，其應負公然聚衆下手實施强暴脅迫之罪責，要無容疑。至被吿周詠之，據證人江鴻供稱：「聽說周詠之把市長推倒，做了一樁很得意的事。」參以證人朱一夫所供：「周詠之衝過溝來」，其有參加暴行，昭然若掃。退一步言，縱使被吿並無毆打吳市長，但當時市長站在溝邊正爲學生毆打危急之際，被吿忽從對溝第三十隊之前（見被吿供詞）率先衝過海來，亦顯已達實施脅迫之程度，殊難解免公然聚衆下手實施强暴脅迫之罪，原判均予諭知無罪，自爲不合。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕立法委員新聞報社長程滄波，出席世界新聞會議歸來，昨日下午二時在乍浦路文化會堂演講，暢談歐美觀感，題爲「今日之世界」。程氏列述共產主義者在歐美各國之陰謀活動，史太林雖宣稱第三國際業已解散，事實上第三國際之地下活動反變本加厲。幸歐美各國已洞悉其奸，羣起阻遏，如共黨在意大利之失敗，以及美國國會之通過懲戒誤國共黨之法案等。總之，今日世界受赤禍者非僅中國一國，其陰謀實針對整個世界而發。且從各方面觀察，共產主義因否定物質以外的一切因素，否定人性人格，故決不能與其他主義共存。今日領導西方民主主義與共產主義搏鬥者爲美國。左傾份子以美國資本主義將崩潰爲宣傳，事實上美國一般物質生活因達極高水準，物價雖較戰前爲高，但工資之收入倍數猶高。且其聯邦立法亦逐漸向社會主義之路前進，故美國絲毫無衰落腐化景象。余（程氏自稱）返國時經舊金山，該地正舉行一「我是美國人」節，美人皆以身爲美國人爲榮，其堅强之自信，深足令人欽佩。余今日特別向全國同胞喚起，我人亦應以身爲中國人而自傲，自己負起責任，則相信我中華民國必能達於繁榮自由之境。</p>

<p>繼由工務局長趙祖康報吿施工經過，並希望三點：（一）市民須愛　橋樑（二）其他橋樑咸能依次興修。（三）閘北西區希按照都市計劃及道路系統逐步完成。趙氏稱：恒豐橋之營建，以經濟實用爲原則，美觀不及四川路橋及河南路橋，然橋身堅固，全橋總長五二·七三公尺，邊孔跨度一〇·三六公尺，中開三孔共一〇五英尺，橋寬一七·四七公尺，其間車行道一一·八九公尺，人行道二一七九公尺，可供四車並行，全部工料費，計國幣三十億餘元。</p>

<p>〔本報南京訊〕南京體育界陳均謨徐汝康袁仲濂等四十二人，對本屆我國世運代表團各項措施，表示不滿，上書敎育部長朱家驊要求澈查，扣發護照，嚴加審核。並請代表團總幹事董守義公開答覆，上朱部長書指摘各點如下：</p>
<p>巧立名目　安挿私人</p>
<p>（一）世運選手之選拔，訂有合格標準，嚴加限制，以免濫竿充數，未料與實際比賽無關之代表團，則竟巧立名目，任意安插私人，以致人數遠超過運動員人數之上，除足球隊已先行出國外，其餘籃球田徑及游泳等三項選手，共僅有十四人，而代表團職員方面，則有團長，總幹事，顧問，領隊，指導，管理，秘書，中文秘書，英文秘書，總敎練，幹事，助理幹事，及隨員等十餘項名目，共達二三十人之多，而其中體育從業人員僅七八人，餘子則非商即賈，據聞此輩之所以鑽營出國者，大都另有其商商業目的在，果其如此，則更將貽笑國際。</p>
<p>蒙蔽政府　營私勾結</p>
<p>（二）前敎部有組織世運體育考察團之舉，今世運代表團不日成行，考察團則渺無消息，試問代表團如許非體育人員，除觀光遊覽及遂其私人目的外，對於未來之中國體育，究能有何裨益。聞其中數人係自費出國，但代表團爲彼等巧立名義，代謀護照，實屬浪費外匯，蒙蔽政府，主持人顯有營私勾結之嫌。</p>
<p>擅募經費　搭乘外機</p>
<p>（三）代表團經費敎部已補助美金二萬五千元，該團主持人竟擅自擴大組織，一方藉口經費不足，四出募捐，而所得之款，迄未公佈，一方面又不願接受中國航空公司之優待辦法，搭乘外機，多耗美金九千餘元，用意何在，令人百思不解。</p>

<h3 id="c122">文學的眞實性 <a href="#c122" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e122" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">122</a></h3>
<p>— 湯匡瀛</p>
<p>托爾斯泰不是說過麼？藝術是美麗的撒謊。</p>
<p>大概是過份深信藝術，所以，在小說式劇本各種故事中，作者們有意渲染許多色彩，使讀者好像一個魔術師而前的看客，給他使用遮眼術撒下天大的謊話。這中間，正因爲大家心頭有這個想頭：「這不過是作家們筆下的盧構呵」！</p>
<p>把文學去作爲社會寫實的人，於是就不免被人看做最大的傻子，大家以爲文學內容之失去眞實性，好像是決定了的。事實上：這數年來，大家僅是歌頌着這時代的偉大，就文學作品講，我們這個文壇裏，描寫前方英勇作戰的小說也有描寫後方光明與黑暗交流的作品也有了，就是思鄕懷舊才氣奔騰的寫作也很多了；但這中間，是不是已够寫實的新神呢？那是一個大問號。大家心裏那句藝術是最大的撒謊，就是他們的信條；所以社會上僅是有些人躱在暗角裏對這源源而來的作品嚷着「够了，够了」；而有些作家們是很少去思維過自己筆下不過是一架攝影機，雖然把些山川草木都拍上片子裏，但裏面缺少一個靈魂的。</p>
<p>本來，藝術或文學是社會意識和對社會現實環境的形象，用文字來表現的一種記錄；他所以該是生活的記載。作家們鄭重地把他收在筆底，不論大至宇宙，微至蒼蠅，都有一個生命的寄托，這樣，藝術才不致是成了一張沒有靈魂的精緻照片，而自有他內涵的眞實性了。</p>
<p>有的人說：文學的鑑賞是各方面的，一個考古家只懂得去留心起碎碗破磁，一個歷史癖的人就只斤斤於作品的年代背景；而唯美主義者却只劉意於詞句的富麗。所以，作反對論者就堅持這一點，主張文學這樣東西雖然是如何刻劃社會可能發生的事實的一種眞實描寫，但不能說除了這點因素之外，文學上是一點都沒有存在性的了。這句話，表面看來似乎頗有幾分歪曲的理由，可是說穿之後，這實在又是一個欺騙。不論是考古家手中的碎碗破磁，歷史家手中的古詩詞曲，或是唯美主義者手中的一首讚美詩，但那些作爲文學上的作品，在他過去某一段時間裏，無可否認他是反襯這一時代的社會意識和社會現實壞境的形象。如今日燉煌千佛洞中的片紙隻字，在一個考古家手中團是一件歷史的陳物，但在社會學者手中他也是一個印象時代活的記載。</p>
<p>其實，把歷史拉起來，重檢我國文學史上各種記錄，現實的描寫幾千年前就被一些前進的文人學士們視爲臬圭了；雖然這遙遠的歷史過　，由於歌頌封建歌頌皇仁的文學過於臃腫，在文學舖張上不免有些地方誇大；但文學上偉大的作品，它往往就是針對現實環境對社會迫視的一個寫照。孔子之作春秋，屈原之作離騷，左思作三都賦，都是迫視現實，對社會的一支針砭，不過各人在文學的手法上有點不同，但他們的目的却是一樣的。</p>
<p>所以，時至今日，有些學者經過對我國現在的文壞一度細察之後，認爲五四的文學革命，固然在中國沉悶的文壇局面上打開了一個新局勢，但由於以後的固步自封，一些淺薄的學者祇搬弄進來了一些外國文學的渣滓，而把我國文學上固有的長處却破壞零落了。這實在不是一個苛論，五四到現在已二十多年了，這時間雖然不算長，但也不算短，即便五四前的文學界是如何紛亂，現在也應抽出一個頭緒來了；而且我們估計這八年的神聖抗戰，不論在各方面，他所給予人認識的印象，決不會减輕於五四時代的情形，那麼現在在我國文學的革新上該有一個更驚人而新奇的發現了；可是，今天所謂文學上的發現又在什麼地方呢？文學的工塲裏作品雖然源源製造出來，但琳琅滿目，除了成爲文學上的豐災之外，還有點什麼呢？</p>
<p>不過，話又要拉回來，這時代，一些作家們由於社會的動盪和物質條件的附制，這對於文學上是一個無可彌補的缺憾。作家們往往因爲受了這兩重條件的催迫，在情緒與文字上就不能得到一個平衡的發展。所謂情緒與文字平衡的發展，就如冰心女士在她的「寄小讀者」一書中所說的：「文字多於情緒，情緒多於文字，都不是寫文章的時候」。因爲悄緒不能控制文字的時候，文字就失去他的眞實性；文字失去了情緒的時候，情緒就失去了他的生存性；文字與情緒是一具肉體與靈魂，而作家的筆尖却是這肉體靈魂間的呼吸管。</p>
<p>勝利後，大家都失望地嗟嘆着爲什麼沒有多的眞實性的偉大作品生產呢？其實受了上面的兩種條件的牽覊，作家們怕敢對現實迫視了；因爲一個只顧衣食還不遑寗處的窮作者，你要他餓着肚深入到社會深層中去，在旁觀者看來這是一件非不能做的事情；而是作家們不去做的事情；可是他們正忽略了這時代正用一根巨槓壓在作家們的背樑上使他們匍伏就範呢？</p>
<p>我們固然認這時代是偉大的，我們固認藝術並非美麗的撒謊；我們固認作家們應儘量描寫這偉大時代中可能盼可能發生的事物，描寫他有生命的眞實性；可是我們也有一個更重要的企求：對作家們要有更有力的生活上的保障。</p>
<h3 id="c123">吾家花 <a href="#c123" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e123" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">123</a></h3>
<p>— 瘦鵑</p>
<p>——紫羅蘭　雜碎</p>
<p>宋代大儒周濂溪先生作「愛蓮說」，對於出淤泥而不染的運花，給與最高的評價，自是蓮花知己，所以後人推定一年十二個月的花神，就推濂溪先生爲六月蓮花之神。區區生平淡泊自甘，從不作　能附鳳之想，而對於花木事，却樂於攀附；祗因生來姓的是周，而世世相傳的堂名，恰好又是「愛蓮」二字，因此對這君子之花却要　附一下，而老實不客氣地稱之爲「吾家花」。</p>
<p>蓮花的別名最多，曰芙蓮，曰芙蓉，曰水芝，曰藕花，曰水芸，曰水旦，曰水筆，曰澤芝，曰玉環，而最普通的是荷花，現在大家通稱蓮花或荷花，面不及其他了。蓮花的種類也特別多，有並頭蓮，四面連，一品運，千葉蓮，重臺蓮等等，還有其他光怪陸離的異種，早就絕無而僅有，無法羅致。蓮花不知始於何時，但它却有一個生日，是農曆的六月二十四日，也不知是那一個好事者替它定出來的，吳俗即稱這一天爲觀述節，吳中士女，往往以簫鼓畫船，觀蓮於葑門外的荷花蕩，如今生活維艱，大家可就沒有這種間情逸致了。淸代詩人徐閽齋氏曾有荷花生日詞兩絕云：「荷葉風前暑氣收，荷花蕩口川波流；荷花今日是生日，妾與郞船開並頭。」「金壇段郞官長淸，臨風淸唱不勝悄；怪郞面似荷花好，郞是荷花生日生。』修花史者可以用作資料。</p>
<p>古今來關於蓮花的詩文詞賦以及典故等等，多至不可勝數，將來心緒稍好，預備編一本專集，給吾家花張目。文賦中最古的有唐崔融「爲百官賀千葉瑞蓮表」漢閔鴻與魏曹植各有「芙蓉賦」；詩中最古的大約要算無名氏古詩「涉江采芙蓉，蘭澤多芳草，采之欲遺誰，所思在遠道……」這一首，至於唐代幾位大詩人，幾乎都有一首「采蓮曲」，更是美不勝收了。</p>
<p>去夏荷花生日後一日，陶冷月兄自滬返蘇，程小靑兄曾僱了一艘船，約我和范煙橋何士鑫二兄同往荷花蕩觀荷，雖沒有深入蕩中，却也瞧到了不少亭亭玉立的白蓮花，瞧過去不染織塵，令人有陸魯望「此花眞合在瑤池」之歎。中山公園去吾家不遠，園中有兩個蓮塘，一大一小，種的都是紅蓮花，鮮豔可愛，我曾兩度前去觀賞，瞧着那一叢叢的翠蓋紅囊，流連忘返。至於吾家梅邱下的蓮塘中，雖有白色淺紅色兩種，去年曾開了好十幾朶，不過占地太小，同時也只開二三朶，不足以壓餓眼；舊有四面觀音，已在淪陷期間斷了種，去春曾向公園中移植紅蓮數枝，發了葉並未開花，那只得再等今年了。鄉前輩潘季儒先生，搜種盆運，有層臺，灑金，鑲邊白蓮等名種七種之多，我曾前往觀賞，難爲觀止，季老允於明春分根見賜，喜不自勝；而老友蔣吟秋兄，也允將圖書館可園中的並蒂蓮和四面觀音移植一二；幷說他有一位老友盧彬士先生，是吳中培植碗蓮的唯一能手，能在小小一個碗裏，開出一朶朶紅紅白白的蓮花來，預約今年開花時節，定以一碗相贈，作愛蓮堂案頭淸供。去夏我爲了紀念亡婦鳳君，特在鳳來儀室外廣種名種鳳仙花，入秋後還是開得爛爛漫漫，所以去年可說是鳳仙花年，而今年該是蓮花年了；要是成績不壞的話，那麼到了農曆六月二十四日，定要招邀勝友，稱觴祝暇，替吾家花做生日咧。</p>

<p>— 趙景深</p>
<p>最近的意大利文壇</p>
<p>從外表看來，意大利的書店像是非常動人的，其中有裝訂老究色彩愉快的藝術書籍和旅行指南，但走到裏面一看，會使你失望、因爲其中的書籍，與歐洲別國差不多。一位陌生客人　要找到意大利知識階級的一般動向和趣味，他只能看到「虎魄」，結爾綏（Hersey）的「希羅希瑪」（Hiroshima），新近從英國來訪問美國的柯士特勒（Koetler）　小說之類，別無其他。對於國外的作品具有熱悄，歐洲各國都是如此，意大利也不是例外。他們不僅翻譯，英法美國的作品，還　譯現代德國和蘇聯的作品。他們出版了不少蘇聯的戲劇，散文短篇小說，也川版個人的專集，如愛倫堡（Ehrenburg）的文集之類，還譯了一部俄國文學史。現代德國的作家如傑斯帕斯（Jaspers），魏　爾特等人的作品也譯了不少。</p>
<p>意大利對於國外作品的興趣，比英法大得多。一方面也由於法西斯蒂壓迫了二十年，好容易得到喘氣的機會，便格外飢餓了。多年前米加絨（Megaro）的「莫索里尼的成就」和海旦（Heiden）的「希特勒」又重新出版，與伊里支，史太林等人的傳記並列。</p>
<p>二三十年代被墨索里尼禁止的仆家又引起了讀者廣大的興味。如沙爾維米尼（Salveminl），史屠爾索（Sturzo），施福爾沙（Slorza），尼蒂（Nitti），波爾吉士（Borgese）等，重又　爲意大利文壇著名的名字。</p>
<p>在反法西斯蒂的作家中有一位格拉姆斯西（Antonio　Gramsci），他的文藝作品現在纔爲人所知，但他已逝世十年了。在墨索里尼得勢以前，格拉姆斯西是議會的議員。他後來在法西斯蒂威力之下入獄，一直被監禁到一九三七年。等到他得到釋放，已得重病，不久就死了。據說他必須入獄的原因是，「二十年來要防止他這樣的頭腦」。但法西斯蒂雖然把他與外面隔離，却不能麻痺他的心靈，他在監牢裘依舊與友人通信，還寫著作。他的書簡集已經出版，被稱爲意大利文學中的傑作。</p>
<p>這些簡的得名不僅爲了政治觀念，也爲了它的文學技術。信中討論到哲學·歷史和經濟，他的思想是介於克羅采（Croce）的理想主義和卡爾的唯物主義之間，他的信將成爲近三十年來意大利知識階級的重要源泉。尤其値得佩服的，在他的人生觀和科學的客觀，雖然外力加强，疾病加重，他仍具有英雄的力量、與危險搏鬥，不肯被它拉下去。</p>
<p>純文藝中有兩本書是値得注意的：一本是李維（Carlo　Levi）的「基督停留在愛博里」（Christ　Stoppel　at　Eboli），已有英譯。還有一本是年靑的作家白爾托（Giuseppe　Berto）的「天空是紅的」（Il　Ciels　E　Rosso），他寫這小說時，還是戰犯，大約受了培克的「怒火之花」一些影響，每一章都要叙到被炸城市的重建。</p>
<p>意大利的小說不大注意新的心理方法或作風的新嘗試；與其注重形式，還是注重內容一些。</p>

<p>— 錢文</p>
<p>自傳說黃帝作指南車以後，中華民族對人類的種種貢獻頗多；最近之戰勝侵略國，也是一種貢獻。</p>
<p>戰勝之後，還有什麼貢獻呢？別人在戰時造出好些新奇的東西，不要說原子彈了，就是慘敗的德國，其火箭武器豈不是戰勝國也得取法而加以改良嗎？人家造出了DDT，吉普車，我們的幾歲大的兒童也會說。我們有的是什麼呢？近世沒有什麼足以自誇的，然而未嘗先人而常隨人，也不算落後太遠，於是人家看見空中飛盤，我也看得見，這就證明了不太落後。至於觀測日蝕，據聞中學生也能參加，觀測後沒有什麼報告，原因是夭氣不做美，　　　　　　非觀測者之罪也。</p>
<p>忽然想到年前要坐飛機赴美的熊貓。熊貓證明了我國之地大物博，正如別處掘出什麼人，什麽人，我們的周口店也出土了一個北京人。這些都是貢獻。三年來我們的各式貢獻中，最驚天動地的是「立春日谿卵站起來」。這是戰勝後第一件大發見，屬於我們的。這發見雖然給愛因斯坦一笑，但是一切科學家都忠實，他們不可以抹煞現象。將來或者有一天，鷄卵的事屢試不爽，我們之中有智者出，提出立卵原理，佈諸世界，那時我們可以揶揄那位愛先生一下，說，相對性原理有何希奇，請你硏究我的立卵論。這時我們的新發見和新發明造成了新光榮。現在呢，愛因斯坦的助手或入室弟子似乎都沒有我國人在內。</p>
<p>熊貓原是國光之一種。我們原有的國光還多，但漸漸比不上熊貓了。吐絲的蠶，供裘的獸，羊毛，皮革，猪鬃，腸衣，鳥羽，鷄蛋，馬牛羊鷄犬豕及其他，不是質不佳是量小，自用不够，外銷不暢，確不及熊貓得人歡迎。我們的雄鷄會生蛋，也是新奇的產物，祗可惜不多見。然而養出生蛋的雄鷄一隻，也不是不光榮，誰敢說我們不會擇種留良，使天下雄鷄不司晨而生蛋呢？</p>
<p>當然還要說到楊妹小姐了。最近科學界對她不食飯的解釋是她的身體內有葉綠素。動物有兩棲類，原來生物界有兩生類，一體而兼動植兩物之能。而且這一種生物是人，人爲萬物之靈，信不誣也。這一種人生在我國，豈非又是一種國光？現在四萬萬七千萬人正在急盼美援糧食早日運到，而其中四萬萬七千萬分之一人可以不需要一粒米麥，我國物（人是生物）博則博矣，對學術之研究或有不可思議的貢獻，惜乎對同胞的胃納沒有一點貢獻何！</p>
<p>聽聞全球各國正在努力增產，而我國對人對自己的貢獻祗不過是前代史官收入五行志的資料幾種。</p>

<p>倫敦葡萄牙街的「斯密史父子公司」是世界上最大的書報社之一。每天由它發售出去的報紙達一百萬份以上。週列和雜誌的經售額近二百萬份。</p>
<p>斯密史公司的營業，現在已不限於報紙雜誌而已。它已擴張到書籍，文具，流通圖書館，印刷，集　，廣告和裝釘各方面。它共設有一千五百個書店和書攤，另有批發分店五十八家。</p>
<p>它的圖書部經常備有八萬種不同的書籍，册數近一百萬本。各地分店的藏書量亦與此數頡頏。另有一百萬册書籍則流通於各圖書館。分店中有五百多家設有出租部。此外，公司每年代修的自來水筆亦達十萬枝左右。</p>
<p>總公司每週所收到的信件平均有三萬封。每年花在報紙訂戶方面的　費近五萬鎊。每年貼在收據上的印花稅達一千鎊，其營業之發達與繁昌可見一斑。</p>

<p>— 半夢老人</p>
<p>近時有巨贊法師，筆墨華膽，詩學亦湛深，靈隱寺方丈却非，屬脩靈隱山誌，巨贊法師於是光印行靈隱小誌一册，中載「呼猿洞在呼猿峯下，深入初寬，漸進漸仄，有時伏地始可過，地皆細沙，約行里許，力盡乃出。壁間有乾隆題名。」余到靈隱多次，所有近處之洞，皆曾往游，未見有可以深入里許之穴，誦其所載，好奇之心又動，即下山，乘公共汽車，抵靈隱山門。下車後，在春淙亭石上小坐，有肩掛念珠出售者，價甚廉，遂購其一，到手播弄，灑落滿地，一小童爲余檢起，終未够數。過合潤橋，俗呼二山門，爲靈隱天竺共有之山門，白樂天詩：「一山門作兩山門，兩寺元從一寺分。」今昔景象已大不相同，天竺距離與此過遠矣。入龍泓洞，洞口有理公塔，轉一綫天，又名玉樹洞，上透，可見天光。再轉石乳洞，大石倒垂，似蓮花下掛，透空玲瓏，遍刻佛像，奇境也，行時偶一不愼，即可碰頭撞額。然其中各洞，是否有所謂伏地行之里許者，遍覓亦無得。洞內有門甚多，此出彼入，怪石森然，千態萬狀，以飛來峯之飛來兩字核之，却甚相符。杭人對於風景，不加整理，亦無題名，游者亦不能深究所在，瞥眼而過，即使對證占本，亦無從劃分淸晰也。</p>
<p>靈隱寺門前，，東有冷泉亭，西有　雷亭，沿澗而築，皆倚飛來峯。由澗橋渡過西行，上升約百數十級，有一亭，名曰翠微，爲靈隱門前勝處。余欲由翠微尋路上躋以登峯頂，竟不可得，乃下亭，仍至石乳洞，轉入山後，覓得一徑上升，登飛來峯頂。峯並不高，築有兩處陣亡將士墓，由峯頂向前得一徑直下，欲轉至靈隱山門前，已相近矣，茶座在望，然路滑石歧，參差無可著脚，不得已折返峯頂，由原路轉石乳洞，回龍泓，始達靈隱門前。在放生池近處坐聽泉聲潺潺，脚力方始恢復。放生池水之下　處有石洞，玲瓏透澈，水　其中作聲，名曰藏六洞，不解所謂「藏六」二字。</p>
<p>飛來峯石壁之美麗，以及靈隱寺門前樹木之茂密，泉韻之爭　，此景要爲杭州湖山第一。游杭州者得游靈隱，即得其精華所在矣。但如飛來峯之山頂，樹木不多，亦無亭台樓閣以點綴之，譬之美人，祗見其面，而霧鬢風髮，一無所有，錦衣　裳，更談不到，未免可惜。爲靈隱計，似應由翠微亭闢大道上升峯頂，峯之前後遍植樹木，於勝美處，添築亭台樓閣，俾之有仙山樓閣之觀，則一幅天然圖畫，更得人力相陪櫬矣。</p>

<p>— 趙景深</p>
<p>藝術的各部門，如文學，繪畫，書法，雕刻，音樂，戯劇等等，都各有其共通性，因此每每一個人能兼擅好幾種藝術。最近我看了三位畫家的畫展，更覺得這話是不錯的。</p>
<p>漁陽王庶熙遠道從蚌埠到上海來開畫展。他不僅長於繪畫和書法，我看出他對於文學也是極有修養的。所以，他寫的字，王羲之「蘭亭序」獨多，此外則有范仲淹的「岳陽樓記」，歐陽修的「醉翁亭記」，杜甫的詩之類。繪畫則有淵明賞菊和放翁團扇。唯其他對於文藝有修養，所以他的畫能不同凡俗，自有「文人畫」的風標。</p>
<p>海寗錢君　更不用說。十餘年前我在「文人剪影」中已經這樣說過：「他懂得音樂，編過歌曲集和歌劇，又是封面裝幀的名家，又會雕刻石章。偶爾興到，寫信給你，會來一個滿幅篆字。」由此可見他雕刻和寫字已非一日之功。最近還看到他的畫。我最喜歡他能別創章法，打破傳統。別人畫牡丹中堂，總要留一些「天頭」，他却偏偏來一個滿幅；否則他就來一張松樹，上面特地留下一半的寫字地位或天頭。「獨樹老夫家」一幅也怪別致的。</p>
<p>吳縣樊伯炎是少雲的公郞，淵源家學，所見名畫極多。他也是多才多藝的。崑曲唱老生，嗓音氣力，極爲充霈。又能彈大套琵琶。現在我又看到他的國畫，以山水爲最好。我最欣賞並愛好他的「舉杯玩月圖」，「烟江暮泊」，「松泉」，「松溪白鷺」等幅，以爲極有神韻和意境。不知怎的，我特別喜歡他的松樹。</p>
<p>我對於繪　是門外漢，凡我前面所說，就算是一個不懂畫的文人印象的觀感吧。</p>
<p>###</p>
<p>三月間，因讀「伊園主人」漫錄一書，出版者未詳「伊園」何人，特爲考證，知係儀徵陳　（六舟）之作，登載本版。日前接到航郵有趙君世暹一函，深以爲快，並將舊藏陳氏致翁同龢書一通錄示，鄙人亦甚感興味。惟來兩寫致舍弟一士，似誤以愚兄弟爲一人。蓋當事變以前之數年，天津國聞週報有「凌霄一士隨筆」常川迎載，編者將兩筆名直行排印，而「凌霄一士」又頗像一個署名，以致讀他處「凌霄漢閣」文者誤爲一士，兩札誤寄，每多轉折，仍須隨時聲明。承抄示陳致翁書，上款稱「叔平宮保前輩」，內容頗簡，蓋其時翁已不居樞要，僅私人通候，首先致唁翁曾源之喪，即書中所云：「仲淵兄之事，良可驚嘆。」曾源字仲淵，乃同龢之胞姪，同治二年癸亥狀元，於陳爲後輩，陳係先一科壬戍傳臚，故只稱仲淵兄而稱同龢爲前輩，以其爲咸豐丙辰，比陳又早三科也。蘇州以狀元特多著名，統計前淸三百年間，江蘇一省之狀元，冠於全國，而蘇州一府之狀元，又田於全省。即同治一朝十三年中，共有六科，而江碟狀元居其四，此四人中，蘇州得其三，即常熟翁曾源（癸亥），吳縣洪鈞（戊辰），元和陸潤庠（甲戍）。其餘三人爲江蘇嘉定徐郙（壬戍），蒙古崇綺（乙丑，即同治后之父），廣東梁耀樞。</p>
<p>常熟翁氏科名之盛，與吳縣潘氏並駕齊驅，皆爲蘇屬之傑出。翁同蘇　叔平，晚號松禪老人，又號瓶叟，乃大學士謚文端翁心存之幼子，心存爲道光壬午翰林，與陳　之父嘉樹同年，其子同書同龢，又都是翰林，而同　與姪曾源（即同書之子）又都是狀元。惟會源中狀元後即以病同籍，棲止林下十餘年而終，爲狀元中之最不幸者，其鄉試會試皆未實際中式，只因其祖及父而推恩賜與，至殿試而一鳴驚人，遂魁天下，逝於丁亥，曲園老人兪樾爲作輓聯云：「三秋桂，三春杏，皆從天上頒來，只獨占金鰲頂上；」「文端孫，文勤子，何意山中歸臥，竟長辭綠野堂前。」吳縣潘氏則潘世恩（乾隆癸丑狀元），潘世璜（乾隆乙卯探花），潘祖蔭（成豐壬子探花），此外進士翰林尚多，不須備記。祖蔭字伯寅，號鄭　，其舉人亦係恩賜，壬子以第三人及第，則比翁同龢早兩科，爲翰林前輩。淸先緒初，二人同官一品，同爲京朝文壇泰斗，詞林監稱「翁潘」；吾弟一十每謂應稱「潘翁」，不應加翁於潘之上·予曰想因「潘翁」似一人之稱，易致誤會耳。</p>
<p>蘇州狀元之盛，至同治期而達於高峯，盛極而衰。光緒一朝有十三科之多，而蘇州狀元乃無一人。（江蘇全省有兩狀元，即庚辰科江寗黃思永愼之，甲午科南通州張　季眞，皆非蘇州。）甲戌科之陸潤庠，為蘇州狀元之殿軍。陸以狀元　相而兼帝師，於民國四年去世，其門生王揖唐輓云：「公門桃李盈天下，」「師相哀榮殿勝朝。」揖唐人不足道，文亦平常，但此聯郤還不錯。</p>

        <h1>1948.06.16</h1>
<h3 id="e1">Wen Wenhao Answers Legislator Inquiries, Explains Military, Financial, and Diplomatic Principles, Specific Questions to Be Answered Individually in Writing <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Office, 15th] Premier Wen Wenhao of the Executive Yuan, in the 12th meeting of the Legislative Yuan on the morning of the 15th, gave an oral address as a general reply to the inquiries from various members regarding the administrative policies during the 9th, 10th, and 11th meetings of the Yuan. Mr. Wen first expressed his gratitude for the corrections made by the members and resolved to make every effort to pay attention to the improvement and effective implementation of the administrative policies. He also declared twice at the beginning and end of his reply that this general reply was decided after consultation with the heads of various ministries and commissions, focusing on the interpretation of major principles. Specific questions will be answered individually in writing successively. He stated that the administrative policy was the direction of administration formulated at the beginning of the constitutional government's Executive Yuan taking office, and the details of the plan will be submitted in the budget.</p>
<h3 id="e2">Improve Treatment, Intensify Training, Clarify the Conscription Policy, Implementing Both Conscription and Recruitment, the Organizational Law of the Ministry of National Defense Is Under Revision <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>Military aspect: 1. How to establish a national defense military system, the organizational law of the Ministry of National Defense is under study and revision, and once the drafting is completed, it will be submitted to the Legislative Yuan. However, during the period of suppressing the rebellion, military actions are extremely important. This matter has been approved by the President. The basic principles of the revised organization of the Ministry of National Defense stipulate that "The Minister of National Defense is responsible for military policy and administrative responsibilities, and the Chief of General Staff is the chief of staff of the commander-in-chief and the administrative officer of the Minister of National Defense, responsible for the planning and guidance of military affairs." "The Chief of General Staff shall execute military orders according to the President's orders, and execute military administration according to the Minister's orders, or according to the Minister's instructions."</p>
<p>2. How to enhance the combat power of North China and Central China, (1) Unite the people, boost morale, command properly, intensify training, and replenish equipment. (2) Improve treatment, clarify rewards and punishments, and provide sufficient supplies to outstanding troops. (3) Allocate weapons and ammunition and intensify training to support the establishment and strengthening of local armed forces. 3. How to supplement manpower and prepare military rations, in order to cope with the increasingly expanding communist bandits, it is necessary to conscript soldiers. However, the household registration is not clear, and the Baojia chiefs are inevitably disturbing the people. In the future, we will strengthen the organization, clarify the conscription policy, and at the same time adopt recruitment methods, implementing both conscription and recruitment to broaden the source of soldiers. We will also do our best to improve the treatment of soldiers. As for the preparation of military rations, which requires 40 million dan per year, in order to avoid increasing issuance by purchasing, we can only continue to levy grain. The Grain Department is actively urging its subordinates to eliminate malpractices.</p>
<h3 id="e3">Reform of the Monetary System to Draft a Plan, State-Owned Enterprises Issue Stocks, Diplomatic Efforts to Urge the Soviet Union to Fulfill the Treaty <a href="#e3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>Financial and Economic Aspects: During the period of suppressing the rebellion, military expenditure is huge. The ordinary budget can be expected to be balanced, but the special budget is bound to be insufficient. In order to increase financial resources, in addition to requesting the Legislative Yuan to assist in increasing tax revenue, a part of state-owned enterprises will be sold to increase revenue. The reform of the monetary system involves too much. We will do our best to formulate proper measures. In the shortest period, responsible authorities will invite experts to complete research and preparation, and formulate a plan to be submitted to the Legislative Yuan for a secret meeting to discuss the implementation. The methods of stabilizing prices by selling materials and tightening issuance in the past will continue. At the same time, issuing stocks of state-owned enterprises, circulating US aid materials, issuing treasury bonds, increasing production, and strengthening exports will all be used to stabilize the lives of the people in the rear.</p>
<p>Diplomatic aspect: The Sino-Soviet border is extremely long and the relationship is very important. Although we paid a great price for the Sino-Soviet Treaty, the Soviet Union also bears many obligations. If we faithfully abide by it, the Soviet Union must also fulfill its obligations. Therefore, the Sino-Soviet relationship still needs to be improved. It is not a mistake of the treaty, but a failure to fulfill it. I have repeatedly negotiated and protested against the Soviet Union's failure to fulfill the treaty. In the future, I will continue to adhere to my position and continue to seek a solution, and will never humiliate the country. As for the Japanese issue, our policy is to prevent the revival of Japanese aggression and to prevent Japan from becoming communist. This is the same position as the United States. Regarding the request for compensation, the Executive Yuan has a Compensation Committee responsible for the details. The detailed compensation plan has been handed over to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to instruct representatives in Tokyo and Washington to implement it effectively, and has never been neglected.</p>
<p>Mr. Wen admitted the bad phenomena pointed out by the members, such as the political atmosphere being too dull and the efficiency being too poor, and explained that the reason was that too much was involved in employing people. However, he has the confidence to serve the country with loyalty. Although there are many difficulties, he lacks the corresponding necessary ability, and he is determined to work hard to break the current situation, and hopes that the Legislative Yuan will provide support in terms of legal system and facts, concentrate efforts under the great goal of suppressing the rebellion, and complete the task. Finally, he sincerely stated that he had no intention of advocating high theories when formulating the administrative policy, and will formulate a schedule and implement it in order. He also hopes that the members will give more advice and work together to shoulder the difficult task.</p>

Finally, the envoys had brief conversations with the President and Vice President and their wives, and the gathering ended happily at 7 pm.</p>
<h3 id="e6">Fiscal Revenue Budget for the Second Half of This Year Totals Approximately 5.4 Trillion <a href="#e6" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c6" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">6</a></h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Office, 15th] The Ministry of Finance has completed the preparation of the national fiscal revenue budget for the second half of this year and submitted it to the Executive Yuan. The total revenue budget is over 5.4 trillion yuan, of which tax revenue is 3 trillion yuan and other revenue is over 2.4 trillion yuan. Of the 3 trillion yuan of tax revenue, commodity tax is still the first, increasing tenfold compared to the budget for the first half of this year, totaling 1 trillion yuan. Customs duty is second, totaling over 700 billion yuan. The budgets for other taxes have also increased eight to ten times compared to the budget for the first half of this year. Among them, the stamp tax budget has increased the most compared to the budget for the first half of this year, being twelve times higher. The budget for direct taxes has also reached over 400 billion yuan. The figures for this tax revenue budget were individually negotiated by Wang Yunwu with the heads of various tax agencies. Although it is still unknown whether the expectations can be met in reality, Wang Yunwu has repeatedly encouraged the heads of various tax agencies to strive to achieve the figures listed in the budget.</p>
<p>It is also learned that the Ministry of Finance will improve the tax rates for various taxes. The tax rates for customs and salt taxes will be adjusted. At the same time, the procedures for collection will also be simplified and improved as much as possible. The Executive Yuan is satisfied with the revenue budget for the second half of the year listed by the Ministry of Finance and hopes that it can be effectively implemented. As for the expenditure budget, it is being prepared by the Directorate-General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics, and its amount still exceeds the total of the revenue budget.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Office, 15th] The Ministry of Finance held a ministry meeting at 3 pm on the 15th. All Vice Ministers, Directors-General, and Directors attended. Wang Yunwu delivered a speech, encouraging the increase of tax revenue and hoping that all colleagues would be responsible at each level and fulfill their duties. It was rumored that Wang Yunwu had submitted his resignation, but relevant parties pointed out on the 15th that this was not true.</p>

<p>[Our Nanjing Office, 15th] Regarding the issues of legislators from the Democratic Socialist Party and the Youth Party, the Kuomintang is still making every effort to persuade and resolve them. People from the Youth Party have already departed for Shanghai by overnight train on the 15th, and people from the Democratic Socialist Party will also go to Shanghai for a meeting on the weekend.

<h3 id="e8">Principal Financial Officials Must Report Private Property Before and After Taking Office. The Legislative Yuan Resolves to Refer the Original Proposal to the Committee for Review. Another Twenty-One Members are Appointed to Review the Plan to Save the Nation from Crisis. <a href="#e8" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c8" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">8</a></h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Office, 15th] The 12th meeting of the Legislative Yuan was held on the 15th, chaired by Sun Ke. The meeting opened at 9:10 am, passed the minutes of the previous meeting, and decided to refer the government proposals submitted by the National Government's Legislative Yuan to various committees for review. Then, the Executive Yuan Premier Wen gave a reply to the inquiries from the legislators regarding the administrative policies. At 10:15 am, Mr. Wen concluded his half-hour speech amid applause and withdrew with the heads of various ministries and commissions. The Legislative Yuan then began the discussion of the agenda. The cases handled throughout the day are as follows: (1) Zhao Huimo and others proposed to request the Executive Yuan to strictly order principal financial officials to report their private property. The resolution was to refer it to the committee for review. (2) Huang Jianzhong and others proposed to amend the articles of the Legislative Yuan's organizational law and the organizational laws of the Legislative Yuan's various committees to revise the provisions regarding the hiring or appointment of specialists and staff. The resolution was to retain it. (3) Hu Qiuyuan and others proposed to form a special committee to review the gains and losses of the country's governance since the victory, in order to prepare for reforms and save the nation from crisis. The resolution was to appoint one person from each of the twenty-one committees to conduct a joint review, formulate measures, and then submit them to the Yuan meeting for discussion. The afternoon meeting ended at 6 pm.</p>
<p>The measures listed in the proposal to request the Executive Yuan to order principal financial officials to report their private property are that the Minister of Finance and the Governor of the Central Bank must truthfully report the amount of their personal property when taking office and leaving office, and strictly prohibit relatives within two degrees of kinship from engaging in related businesses during their tenure. Those who have served in these two positions during the National Government period are also required to report the amount of property before June 20th of this year and attach an explanation. During the discussion of this case, only one or two people spoke out against it. The majority of opinions also advocated expanding its scope to all military and political leaders in various Yuan, ministries, commissions, and local areas.</p>
<h3 id="e9">Sun Ke Requests Attention to the Speed of Handling Cases <a href="#e9" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c9" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">9</a></h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Office, 15th] Since the establishment and opening of the Legislative Yuan, the progress has been very slow. Only three cases were handled throughout the day on the 15th. President Sun therefore asked the members to pay attention to efficiency at the end of the meeting on the 15th, saying that if the meeting is conducted at a speed of one case every two hours, there is no hope of a recess this summer, and it also affects the administrative side. Many cases have value for establishment and should be submitted for review. It is best to express less opinions before the review and leave them for discussion in the review committee to avoid delaying the Yuan meeting. Finally, it was decided that in the future, when each case is first brought up for discussion, the proposer will explain the reasons first, then the opponents will speak, and then the supporters will respond, in order to facilitate the meeting.</p>

<h3 id="e20">Regulations for Exercising Supervisory Power, the Control Yuan Will Discuss and Formulate Them at the Third Meeting Today, the Meeting Regulations Were Amended and Passed in Full <a href="#e20" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c20" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">20</a></h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Office, 15th] The third meeting of the Control Yuan is scheduled to be held on the morning of the 16th to discuss the formulation of regulations for exercising supervisory power, the organizational law of various committees, and the organizational regulations of the Control Yuan's administrative office.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Office, 15th] The second meeting of the Control Yuan was held at 9:30 am on the 15th, chaired by President Yu. First, the secretariat read the minutes of the first meeting and the three telegrams of respect and condolence from the general assembly to the national soldiers suppressing the rebellion, the refugees in various regions, and the overseas Chinese. Then, the draft meeting rules of the Control Yuan were discussed, and the chairman of the review committee, Zhang Weihan, explained the review process. Committee member Tang Honglie advocated discussing them chapter by chapter in order to be quick and have a focus, which was unanimously agreed. The first chapter, general principles, was discussed first. Many people expressed their opinions, but the opinions were concentrated on Article 3 (which was Article 4 in the discussion on the 14th, now adjusted to Article 3). In the article, divided into several points, one is the Yuan meeting time, one is the number of attendees, one is the difference between the plenary meeting (also the annual meeting) and the monthly meeting, etc. After more than two hours of discussion, at 11:50 am, someone proposed to ask the chairman to summarize the opinions and submit them for a vote. After a vote, there were no changes to the text of Article 3 except for the deletion of eight characters. After extending the time, the first chapter was voted on article by article, and when it came to Article 3, someone proposed that a provision for "closed meetings" should be added. Many people agreed, but in the end it was considered that it could be included in Chapter 4, "Meetings". Then, the discussion continued, and all ten articles of the first chapter were passed without dissent. The text of the third article as amended and passed is recorded as follows: "The meetings of this Yuan shall be held once a month, and shall not be held unless one-fifth or more of all Control Yuan members are present. A decision shall be made with the consent of more than half of those present, but the meeting in March each year shall be a general annual review, and must have the attendance of more than half of all members."</p>
<p>The meeting continued at 3:30 pm, and the meeting rules were discussed chapter by chapter. By about 6 pm, the entire case had been passed. The afternoon meeting was still chaired by President Yu, and at 4:45 pm, Mr. Yu left in advance, and Deputy President Liu continued to preside over the meeting. The more heated discussion in the meeting was also the most important part of the whole case, about the following points: (1) In Chapter 4 (Meetings), add a clause for closed meetings. Liu added Article 20 after Article 19, the text of which is: "The meetings of this Yuan shall be open, and when necessary, on the proposal of the chairman or the attending members, and with the consent of the attending members after consulting the chairman, it may be announced that the meeting will be changed to a closed meeting." (2) Chapter 7 (Exercise of the Power of Consent) was discussed for a long time, and there were many opinions. Some people believed that a provision for the consent power review committee should be added separately. For a time, speakers were very enthusiastic, but when it was put to a vote, it ultimately failed to pass due to the small number of votes. Only Article 40 (the original Article 39) was slightly amended, and its text is: "The exercise of the power of consent shall have the attendance of more than half of all Control Yuan members, and its resolution shall adopt a secret ballot method." (3) The chapter name of Chapter 8 was changed from "Minutes of Meeting" to "Meeting Minutes". (4) In Article 46 (the original Article 45) in Chapter 9 (Order), most people expressed dissatisfaction with the words "warning to stop" and changed it to "reminding them to pay attention." The rest were passed without dissent, and the meeting adjourned at 6 pm.</p>

<p>[This newspaper, Fanyang, 15th] The bandits on the periphery of Changchun withdrew on the 14th in separate routes. The bandit's Independent 7th, 8th, and 9th Divisions fled back to Kalun, Yinma River, and Ponizi in the east of Changchun. A part of the Independent 10th Division retreated to Datun in the southwest of Changchun. The 6th Column retreated to the Changchun Fort, Hengtoushanzi, and Danantun area in the south of Changchun. A part of the 1st Column retreated to the west of the Dafangshen Airport. The reason for the bandits' withdrawal is that there is insufficient food and ammunition, and the supply is difficult. However, it has not yet been determined whether it is a feigned retreat. However, more than a thousand bandits raided the Green Park in the urban area of Changchun on the night of the 14th, and fierce battles were still raging until the morning of the 15th. This group of bandits may be covering the withdrawal mission. According to military intelligence: The communist bandits claim that the cost of attacking Changchun is too high, and they have decided to transfer their forces to obstruct the National Army reinforcements in the Northeast.</p>

<h3 id="e25">Starting with the Difficulties of the Machine Industry <a href="#e25" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c25" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">25</a></h3>
<p>At the beginning of the foreign exchange reform, the authorities were rumored to have a plan to largely or completely liberalize the import of production equipment, allowing it to be purchased with self-provided foreign exchange. This newspaper once wrote an article praising this idea. This is because such equipment is the mother of all industries. Some imported machinery cannot be used because accessories are difficult to obtain, while some machinery that has already been ordered is being used as an excuse to set up factories and start production in Hong Kong. In order to protect national industry and promote domestic production, it is only reasonable to encourage the import of production equipment.</p>
<p>However, amidst the shortage of production equipment and the calls for welcoming foreign goods, there is also a contradictory phenomenon that must be given serious attention, namely, the machine industry in this city is on the verge of extinction. It is said that there are about 900 factories in this industry, large and small, with 20,000 machine tools and about 60,000 workers. Due to the decline of industry, especially the contraction or relocation of the textile industry, their manufactured goods are selling poorly, and there is too much inventory, resulting in a very difficult situation. This can be explained by the following reasons:</p>
<p>(1) The so-called production equipment is limited in variety. Some departments cannot manufacture domestically and have to purchase foreign goods, while at the same time, other departments are experiencing overproduction for the reasons mentioned above.</p>
<p>(2) The accessories for originally imported machines cannot be supplied domestically and still need to be sourced from abroad.</p>
<p>(3) There is a class of manufacturers who trust foreign machines far more than domestic products, preferring to buy foreign goods rather than domestic ones.</p>
<p>We believe that the above two points, (1) and (2), are easily solvable factual problems. Apart from allowing the machine industry to gradually improve over time and find ways to solve them, the state should earnestly promote domestically produced finished products that can now be substituted, expand their sales, and alleviate their current difficulties. This will also help cultivate this unique basic industry in the country. The methods are: 1. State-owned factories should give priority to using domestic goods to promote them; 2. When applying for the import of production equipment, any domestic products that can be substituted should be strictly reviewed and rejected; 3. Private factories should be persuaded to use domestic goods.</p>
<p>In the past, there was a vehicle manufacturer whose products were quite excellent. Although they were gradually adopted by officials and merchants, it is said that the process of persuading them to purchase and try them was very difficult and painful. Last year, domestically produced locomotives in a certain area were finally manufactured with great difficulty, but it seems that no one paid attention to them. Looking at these kinds of examples, it can be seen that the development of the machine industry in its infancy is indeed not easy. However, at this time when finished products are stagnating and unable to be maintained, everyone should think further ahead and jointly maintain this fragile foundation in order to develop domestic products, reduce unemployment, and reduce the waste of foreign exchange funds.</p>
<p>It is said that since the victory, the industry's output has mostly been supplied to the textile industry. In March of this year, the Ministry of Economic Affairs convened a textile machinery manufacturing meeting, which originally had a plan to manufacture 200,000 spindles and 7,000 looms within a year and a half. It is hoped that this plan can be effectively promoted. At the same time, the Textile Control Commission should change its focus to increasing production and not tie itself up, making manufacturers shy away. In this way, not only will the difficulties of the machine industry be easily resolved, but the prospects of the textile industry will also be easily restored to their original prosperity. It is said that there is now a proposal to reform the Textile Control Commission. We believe that simply changing the organization, changing the name, and moving personnel will not have much effect. It is better to change the policy and focus on increasing production. Genuinely helping manufacturers to solve their difficulties and not simply increasing their burdens is somewhat in line with Premier Weng's policy statement on strengthening production, using the most effective solutions, and stabilizing prices.</p>
<p>Premier Weng also mentioned hoarding and evading capital, and the government is discussing countermeasures, which is naturally something everyone eagerly hopes for. However, in terms of production equipment, one aspect is that there is too much inventory and it cannot be sold, while another aspect is that factories are relocating to the south to purchase foreign equipment, allowing a large amount of capital to flow abroad. In this regard, we must appeal to the government to promptly implement the above-mentioned remedial measures to cooperate with the current national policy.</p>
<p>Premier Weng is very concerned about the danger of inflation, believing that if the national treasury cannot increase its income, it will inevitably issue more currency, and the market will collapse. It seems that there is a chance to stop inflation in the future. This is naturally something everyone is happy to hear. But I don't know if he has fundamentally changed his loan policy. If he still follows the old habits and starts with ordering and purchasing goods, then we ask that domestically produced equipment that is unsalable and closely related to the national economy should at least be considered in the same way as daily necessities. Do not abandon it simply because it is not profitable at the moment. Because the purpose of state-owned banks in providing loans is originally to increase production and support industry, and they should not only aim at making profits by disguising hoarding. Since production equipment is the foundation of all industries, and the loans it needs are larger and longer in duration, if state-owned banks do not come out to support it, the industry may collapse completely. If state-owned banks turn a blind eye to the crisis in the machine industry, it may not be an appropriate measure that "takes the interests of the people as its own interests"!</p>

<p>[Our Ningbo Dispatch, 15th] As the price of rice rises in a straight line, the common people are panicked. Yesterday, the price at the door reached as high as 13 million [currency units] per dou, leading to a full-scale rice-snatching riot. Xiangji Rice Shop on Zhenming Road was the first to suffer, and in an instant, it spread to Jiangdong and Jiangbei, with more than 200 rice shops, large and small, spared none. Although the military police rushed to suppress it, they were unable to stop the rising emotions of the masses. The rice riot lasted for six hours, starting at 5:00 PM, with total losses estimated to be over 100 billion [currency units]. In Wanfeng Rice Shop in Jiangdong, a man named Wei Runqing was crushed to death under a rice sack while snatching rice, and more than ten people were injured. County Magistrate Chen and Bureau Chief Lu, seeing the seriousness of the situation, personally led the police to patrol and disperse the crowds, and the riots gradually subsided. After the incident, the political and military leaders met to decide that the highest rice price today should not exceed 9 million [currency units], and each person should be limited to two sheng. The County Chamber of Commerce will convene an emergency meeting today to discuss the aftermath. In addition, the curfew time in this port will be moved up starting tonight, and all theaters in the city will be closed for one day.</p>
<p>[Our Wujin Dispatch, 15th] The market is chaotic and rumors are rampant. Today, the rice price outside the market reached 13 million [currency units], far exceeding the price of tin. At 10:00 AM, Dayuancheng Rice Mill on Bei Men Guanhe Road was the first to experience rice snatching. Initially, a child went to buy one sheng of rice with a basket and was asked for 120,000 [currency units]. When the child returned with the money, he was asked to pay 128,000 [currency units], leading to a conflict that caused more than 100 poor men, women, old, and young people to rush in and snatch more than 30 shi. At 11:00 AM, Tongchang Rice Mill on County School Street was suddenly affected, losing more than 100 shi. In the afternoon, Dacheng Grain Store on Qingshan Bridge was also robbed. The county government and military police urgently dispatched troops to suppress the riots and strictly ordered the grain merchants to suppress the grain price and not exceed the price of tin. In addition, rice shops are supplied by factories, and transactions outside the market and operations by non-industry personnel are strictly prohibited. Furthermore, 20,000 civilians are immediately targeted for daily distribution of low-priced rice.</p>

<p>[Our Suzhou Dispatch, 15th] The Wuxian Public Hospital has been established for more than a year. Thanks to the enthusiastic donations from local gentry Yan Xinqi and others, the equipment is complete, and it has long been known as the best in the counties along the Shanghai-Nanjing line. However, recently, due to a case of switching medicines for hospitalized patients, local people have been gossiping, and the hospital's reputation has been greatly reduced. On April 17, a military officer Zhao, whose son Lianming, four years old, suffered from epidemic meningitis, came to the hospital for treatment. Although the hospital had no isolation ward, it rashly admitted him and instructed Zhao to purchase penicillin solution himself and hand it over to the hospital for daily injection. However, the illness did not subside. Zhao suddenly discovered that the medicine had been switched. On May 1, he secretly marked the medicine bottle, which confirmed that the medicine bottle had been switched. After asking a doctor to determine that it was distilled water, Zhao questioned the hospital. After repeated negotiations, the hospital pointed out that the person responsible was the head nurse Xu Meiyu, who was dismissed after writing a letter of repentance and secretly sent to the Wudi Inspection Office for investigation and detention. Zhao's son died on the 6th of this month, and his family refused to collect the body. The hospital purchased a nanmu coffin and reported it to the Inspection Office for inspection before directly collecting and storing it in the funeral home. The family still refuses to collect it. All parties concerned are tight-lipped about the truth of the case. The hospital's board of directors once planned to convene a meeting of directors to discuss the solution, but because the directors were pessimistic about the future of the hospital, both meetings were adjourned. Various sectors of society have criticized the responsibility of hospital director Zou Sitai and are closely watching the Inspection Office's handling of the case.</p>

<p>[Central News Agency, Guiyang, 15th] The Xiuwen River Hydropower Project, jointly operated by the Guiyang Power Plant and the National Resources Commission, has recently made great progress. It is reported that the entire project can be completed by the end of this year, and power can be transmitted to Guiyang by the end of June next year. The earthwork and stonework project of the river dam at the Xiuwen River plant site was completed at the end of last year. The side wall of the intake and the central pier earthwork have been excavated, and the stonework is currently being laid, which is scheduled to be completed in August. The total length of the diversion channel is about 1,450 meters, connected by three tunnels and open channels, and most of it has been completed. Currently, work is being stepped up to clean it up, and it will be completed next month. The plant site has been selected on the right bank of the Maotiao River, about 100 meters from the mouth of the Xiuwen River. A 30-foot-wide and 150-foot-deep plant foundation has been excavated from the steep cliffs. However, due to the high prices and the decline in currency value this year, although all projects are about to be completed, the 40 billion [currency units] required for the construction of the plant are currently being requested from the National Resources Commission for additional budget.</p>

<p>[Central News Agency, Beiping, 15th] According to the announcement of the Beiping Garrison Headquarters: Tong Zengyi Silver Shop on East Ma Road in Tianjin, which has been established in Tianjin for many years, is an economic organization established by the Communist bandits. The person in charge of the shop is a Communist Party member who uses the operation of the silver shop as cover, handles remittances from the bandit area, and harbors Communist personnel to disrupt finance and seize materials.

<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 15th] After the salaries of officers and soldiers nationwide are adjusted monthly according to the cost of living index, they must be issued in three installments, which easily causes misunderstandings among the troops who do not know the truth. According to the relevant authorities of the Logistics Command: The cost of living index can only be calculated after the Executive Yuan approves it in the middle and late part of the month. Therefore, the next month's funding for various military units cannot be fully issued in one go. However, in order to take into account the actual needs, it is issued in installments. For example, the funding for July is first pre-issued in early June according to the amount given in May. After the amount given in June is approved, it will be increased according to the amount given in June. When the amount given in July is approved, it will be fully issued, and there is no delay in the payment of salaries.</p>

<h3 id="e52">The Mystery of Yang Mei Remains Unsolved; Yang Sen Declares He Will Not Stop Testing; States She Has Become a Research Subject for Scientists Worldwide <a href="#e52" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c52" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">52</a></h3>
<p>[This Newspaper's Chongqing Dispatch, 15th] Mayor Yang Sen firmly believes that Yang Mei does not eat. According to his original plan, he intended to send medical personnel to accompany Yang Mei back to her original home in E'du to continue the examination and to conduct in-depth research on the environment of Yang Mei's origin, such as grass and water. He deeply feels that Yang Mei's special physiological structure may affect her lifespan, so finding a suitable place for Yang Mei's residence is the most important condition before research. Later, due to the unrest in E'du and Shizhu, he feared robbery by gangsters or accidents, which has delayed the plan until now. Yang Mei now lives in Chongqing, and he has an inescapable duty to be Yang Mei's guardian. Outsiders do not understand the truth and speculate a lot. His daughter, Yang Wanyun, who is currently studying at Jindai University in Beijing, recently wrote a letter from Beijing saying, "Dear Dad, the Beijing newspapers often talk about your opinions on Yang Mei, some of which are not very good, of course. I hope you can be a little careful to avoid unfounded satire. But I'm not very clear about what's going on with Yang Mei. I hope you can tell me something." Yang described this with witty remarks, fully revealing his soldier's forthright and frank personality. Because Yang Mei is a woman, he is determined to study the mystery of her not eating to the end. His wife also advised him that he could not finish managing national affairs, so why bother with this? However, if the mystery of Yang Mei is not solved one day, he will never give up. He also expressed dissatisfaction with Zhuo Songdai's strange attitude towards Yang Mei. He once accompanied his wife to visit Yang Mei. Yang Mei reported to him in person that she wanted to go home. When asked why, she replied that after returning home, she could sell a chicken and a pig to buy cloth to sew clothes. Although Yang Mei does not eat, she still has the feminine nature of loving beauty and likes daily cosmetics such as floral fabrics, lipstick, powder, and leather shoes. He immediately advised her not to worry, that his wife could send her everything. But Che Songdai showed displeasure nearby. It is clear that Zhuo does not want any organization to have close contact with Yang Mei. Yang also solemnly told this newspaper reporter: He has the responsibility to uncover the mystery of Yang Mei's not eating, and will start to move Yang Mei from Zhuo's residence in Jiulongpo to an ideal location suitable for Yang Mei's living environment within days. Yang's sole research with this newspaper reporter resulted in the most suitable place being the Shantung Forest Garden in the suburbs of the city. There is Yue River there, allowing Yang Mei to enjoy the mountains and rivers, wear cloth clothes, and go barefoot without any restraint, as she likes. The house is also spacious enough to accommodate experts and researchers. In addition, the location is remote, so even if Yang Mei wants to buy something to eat, it is impossible. However, the so-called guardians such as Zhang Lao Tai Tai and Ran Xiao Jie are refused to accompany her. Yang Mei is already familiar with and has a good impression of female police officers and nurses. With their accompaniment, loneliness can be reduced, otherwise loopholes are inevitable and people will still be suspicious. Yang emphasized that Yang Mei can no longer be privately owned by any individual. She has become a research subject for scientists all over the world, so the city government has the responsibility to protect her and will never allow any examination that would harm Yang Mei's body and mind. According to Hu Xianwen, the dean of Zhongzheng Hospital, although the technical committee for studying Yang Mei has not actively carried out its work, he has close contact with the heads of various hospitals in Chongqing and is fully prepared for the next step of clinical examination of Yang Mei. They welcome American experts Glaci and Roth to Chongqing, but before they arrive in Chongqing, Chongqing medical scientists should at least have a preliminary research result, such as chemical analysis of blood and urine, and various examinations of bacterial physiology, as a reference for further in-depth research by Chinese and foreign experts. Therefore, it is believed that it is the best measure to first move Yang Mei to Zhuo's residence in Jiulongpo in terms of the environment. The technical committee will hold a meeting within days to discuss the steps in detail. Once Yang Sen instructs the Bureau of Health, Yang Mei's next step of examination can be made more thorough by breaking away from the shackles of her previous guardian.</p>

<h3 id="e53">Both Houses of Congress Take Swift Action; U.S. Congress to Adjourn Within the Week; Replenishing National Defense to Complete Legislation <a href="#e53" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c53" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">53</a></h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 14th] The U.S. Congress took swift action on the 14th to begin moving the peacetime conscription bill, the foreign aid bill, and the extension of the reciprocal trade agreement closer to passage in the final week before adjournment. Whether the congressmen have achievements in this, the last week of the 80th Congress, will have a significant impact on the 1948 political campaign. President Truman has repeatedly criticized what he calls "the second worst Congress in history." In his speech in Los Angeles, he asked members of Congress to continue to meet until the price control bill and the housing bill were resolved, but Republican leaders are proceeding with their own plans to adjourn on June 19. The dynamics of the Senate and House of Representatives are listed below:</p>
<p>(1) The House Rules Committee reluctantly passed the conscription bill for young people aged 19 to 25 and submitted it to the House. In fact, the passage of this bill before the House adjourns has already been decided. The Senate has already passed a similar bill.</p>
<p>(2) The Senate passed and returned to the House a bill extending the reciprocal trade agreement for one year. The bill places some restrictions on President Truman's power to reduce tariffs. The House previously passed a bill giving Congress the power to veto tariffs and is expected to accept the Senate's opinion.</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 14th] The United States took action on the 14th to strengthen its air force and maintain its mission in a better world geared towards national defense. The House of Representatives has just passed a bill and submitted it to the Senate, which legally stipulates the establishment of seventy air force groups. Funds for the expansion of the air force have already been allocated, and the bill will provide for the establishment of an air force of seventy regular groups, with a total of 502,000 service personnel. President Truman has just signed a bill for new construction for the Army and Air Force, which stipulates that the Army ground forces may use 3,803,000 yuan for housing and other facilities on the Mariana Islands, and the Air Force may use 5,376,000 US dollars for barracks and other facilities. In addition, another 3,690,000 yuan was allocated to improve the US military camps in the Philippines.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 14th] The Senate Appropriations Committee approved 3,812,000,000 US dollars for the Navy's expenses in the next fiscal year, which is an increase of 125 million US dollars compared to the amount approved by the House of Representatives.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 14th] Army Secretary Royal and Chief of Staff Bradley today urged the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee to restore 492 million yuan of the 600 million yuan cut by the House of Representatives from the Army's budget. Bradley emphasized that today's world situation requires an expansion plan, and appropriate national defense is still the best guarantee for survival under peaceful conditions.</p>

<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 14th Special Dispatch] The U.S. Senate Appropriations Committee today unanimously passed a foreign aid bill totaling 6,125,700,000 yuan, which in fact restored the 1,175,000,000 yuan cut by the House of Representatives. The bill will be submitted to the Senate for debate tomorrow and includes the following appropriations: (1) 4 billion in cash for the first year of implementation of the European Recovery Program. (2) 460 million yuan for aid to China for a period of twelve months, of which 125 million yuan is designated for military assistance. (3) 250 million yuan in aid to Greece and Turkey. (4) 1,325,000,000 yuan for US military and relief expenses in the occupied areas, of which 125 million yuan is designated for assistance to Japan and North Korea's recovery. (5) 20 million yuan for the United Nations Children's Emergency Relief Fund. (6) 70,070,000 yuan allocated to the United Nations International Refugee Organization. Committee Chairman Bridge told reporters: He expects that the bill will not encounter major opposition in the Senate, but people in the House of Representatives said: There will inevitably be a heated debate when the House and Senate hold a joint conference to obtain a compromise bill.</p>

<p>[U.S. News Agency, Los Angeles, 14th] President Truman gave a speech to guests and members of the Los Angeles Newspaper Club today, demanding a "price control law ready for implementation at any time," (a distribution law that "allows the circulation of scarce materials") and federal housing legislation.

<p>[U.S. New Development Office, Washington, 14th] Congress today overrode the President's veto and, by a more than two-thirds vote, enacted legislation amending the U.S. Social Security System. This new law increases relief funds for the elderly, blind, and dependent children in each state, while at the same time depriving a considerable number of groups, including salespeople, truck drivers, and traveling car drivers, of the right to old-age pensions. The override of the President's veto was first taken by the House of Representatives with a vote of 297 to 75, followed by the Senate's vote of 65 to 13, thus causing both houses to enact legislation by a more than two-thirds majority, regardless of the President's veto.</p>

<p>[This newspaper's news] London, 15th Broadcast: Bernadotte arrived in Cairo today to explore the possibility of a permanent ceasefire in Palestine with Arab leaders. It is said that although both sides have slightly violated the ceasefire, this is an inevitable phenomenon at the beginning.</p>
<p>[United Press, Cairo, 15th] The six-and-a-half-month war in Palestine saw complete silence on all fronts for the first time yesterday. The United Nations mediation team is stepping up its efforts to promote a lasting peace between the Arab and Jewish sides during the four-week truce. Mediator Bernadotte has completed his deployment on Rott Island and flew to Cairo today to meet with Arab leaders on peace talks, and then flew to Tel Aviv on the 17th to meet with Israeli authorities. At the same time, political and military leaders of Arab countries gathered in Cairo this morning to decide on a policy to deal with the peace talks. The first thing that Berne needs to decide is whether the Arab and Jewish sides are willing to hold a roundtable meeting on Rott Island. As of now, neither side has changed its attitude.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Cairo, 15th] Highly reliable sources here claim that in the future peace negotiations on Palestine, the Arab side will suggest imitating the Swiss federal system and establishing a federation in Palestine composed of several regions enjoying great autonomy, with each state sending representatives to the central committee. This central committee will be controlled by the Arab ethnic group, and the federal foreign affairs will be handled by the central committee. It is expected that the Arab side's suggestion will hardly be accepted by the Jewish side, because the Jewish side has previously clearly stated that it will never accept any suggestion that does not allow it to enjoy full national sovereignty.</p>

Well-informed sources emphasized that this meeting would never be convened, because the U.S. authorities recently stated that unless the Soviet Union has concrete guarantees to prove that the meeting is constructive, it should not hold talks with Moscow again.</p>

At the same time, it also shows that while Western powers are focusing all their attention on Western Europe, the Far East Communist Information Bureau has made considerable progress under its hard work.</p>

<h3 id="e70">Municipal Government Rice Price Review Meeting Decides; Rice Price Controls to Be Restored Today; White Rice May Exceed 10 Million Per Stone <a href="#e70" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c70" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">70</a></h3>
<p>Rice prices have been soaring for days. Mayor Wu Guoguo and Committee Chairman Ren Zhuwei Xianqun, in order to completely eliminate the rise and stabilize grain prices, specially convened relevant parties at the Municipal Government Conference Room at 5:00 p.m. on the 15th to hold a rice price review meeting. After careful study by all parties, it was unanimously agreed that rice prices cannot be allowed to soar out of control and that it is necessary to impose restrictions. Therefore, it was finally decided that starting from the 16th, the price control method would be adopted as before, and the price of top-quality white rice should not exceed 10 million yuan per stone. If there are any cases of exceeding the price limit after the implementation of the price control method in rice shops in this city, citizens can report them as much as possible or refuse to purchase. When selling rice, rice shops must also record the names and addresses of citizens who purchase rice in detail to prevent multiple purchases and hoarding, and to facilitate spot checks by the competent authorities. It is reported that Mayor Wu immediately notified the People's Food Allocation Committee and the Police Bureau of this method after the meeting. If rice shops violate the rules, in addition to the police station being responsible for sending them to court for legal processing, the People's Food Allocation Committee may also revoke their rice allocation qualifications.</p>

<p>Committee Chairman Ren of the People's Food Allocation Committee also made a statement to reporters after the meeting, saying: The actual rice consumption of this city is 640,000 stones, and the current allocation volume is 500,000 stones, a difference of 140,000 stones. The government has decided to supply half of this shortfall, which is 70,000 stones, and the rest will be supplied by rice merchants. The rice supplied by the government will be sold every other day, 6,000 stones each time, at a price of 9.2 million yuan per stone. The rice supplied by the market will be limited to 9.8 million yuan, so the maximum price limit must not exceed 10 million yuan. Finally, Ren also stated: The People's Food Allocation Committee is still affiliated to the Municipal Government, and the rumor that it will be transferred to the Ministry of Food is not true. He himself has dispelled his intention to resign and is determined to take on this difficult task again. There will be absolutely no problems with the supply of allocated rice in Shanghai in the future. The selling price of household rice will also be rationalized and will not be calculated based on 95% of the market price. Ren also emphasized that the price limit of 10 million yuan per stone is officially announced by the Municipal Government and will be strictly enforced. The People's Food Allocation Committee has decided to dispatch 100 people starting from the 16th to cooperate with the economic police to thoroughly investigate rice shops and strictly enforce price controls.</p>

<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The hotel industry in the city requested a 100% price increase from the Social Affairs Bureau yesterday, and requested the Social Affairs Bureau to approve the price increase to take effect from the 16th of this month for hostels and the 18th for hotels.

(2) Before the war, the daily rate per room in hotels was seven yuan, but now it is 1.2 million yuan, about 200,000 times the pre-war rate. However, the general price level has exceeded 990,000 times. (3) Workers' salaries are calculated based on the price of gold. If salaries are reduced, it will inevitably lead to petitions.

<p>The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Hai Sui steamer, originally scheduled to depart from Shanghai to Xiamen at noon on the 15th, was unable to depart due to a lack of fuel, causing passengers to complain. According to the person in charge of the bureau, the bureau had long felt the difficulty in fuel supply. Several months ago, it had repeatedly petitioned the higher authorities for assistance in resolving the issue. On April 24, the Executive Yuan specifically convened a meeting in Beijing for this purpose, resolving that the Diesel Allocation Committee of the Import and Export Management Committee would allocate 9,000 tons of diesel to the bureau every month starting from May. However, after repeated consultations and urgings, the Diesel Allocation Committee has not yet complied with the order to allocate the fuel. Recently, the Mei Foo Oil Company specially sold 5,000 tons of diesel to the bureau to meet the urgent need, and an application was made to the Central Bank for foreign exchange settlement. However, the application procedure was quite complicated, and it was not until the afternoon of the 11th of this month that the Central Bank allowed the foreign exchange settlement. However, since the implementation of the new foreign exchange settlement method on June 1, the bureau's fuel consumption also requires a foreign exchange settlement certificate before it can be settled with the Central Bank. However, the acquisition of foreign exchange settlement certificates is quite difficult, so it has not yet been completed, causing the Hai Sui steamer to be unable to depart. The Linsen, Haikang, Haiyue, Xilin, Hai'e, Haidian, and other ships will also be suspended today and tomorrow due to a lack of fuel.</p>

Traffic in the area was suspended from 12:30 PM until 8:00 PM. All the injured were sent to various hospitals for emergency treatment, including two seriously injured people who may be in danger of death.</p>
<p>At 6:30 yesterday morning, a worker wearing blue work clothes was riding on the Route 5 public bus running between Caojiadu and Jing'an Temple. When the bus was halfway, ticket inspector No. 35, because he had not purchased a ticket, inquired with him. The worker then showed a temporary ID card from the "Ordnance Bureau of the United Logistics Headquarters." Because the ticket inspector was not a soldier, he asked him to buy a ticket, but was refused. While they were arguing, the bus stopped at the Huashan Road intersection of Jing'an Temple. At that time, a vehicle of the Ordnance Bureau was also full of workers and stopped there. The worker got off the bus and called several colleagues from the vehicle, intending to drag the ticket inspector away, causing a dispute. Within a few minutes, more public buses arrived, and the drivers and ticket sellers also gathered and reasoned with the other party. The Jing'an Temple Police Station learned of the incident and sent police to take four workers from the Ordnance Bureau to the station. After mediation, they were released, but the worker who refused to purchase the ticket, Pan Liliang, was detained by the Jing'an Temple Military Police for interrogation.</p>
<p>Gathering Workers to Cause Trouble on the Road</p>
<p>This matter could have come to an end, but the released workers were unwilling to give up. After returning to the repair office, they gathered many workers and drove a military truck loaded with stones to the vicinity of Gao'an Road at around 11:00 AM. When a Route 15 public bus with license plate number 544 approached, the workers threw stones at the bus without asking any questions. There was chaos, and the passengers fled in all directions. Fortunately, no one was seriously injured, but ticket seller No. 555 and No. 290 were injured, and driver No. 763's head was broken by a stone. Seeing that their goal had been achieved, the soldiers sped away. The injured were immediately sent to the Red Cross Hospital for treatment.</p>
<p>Many Ticket Sellers and Drivers Injured</p>
<p>At 12:30 PM, the workers escalated their actions, gathering more than a hundred people, riding in three large trucks, and driving to the vicinity of Tianyaoqiao in Xujiahui. They then got out of the truck, holding iron bars, iron cones, and other weapons, and walked to the Route 15 public bus station on Hengshan Road and the Route 5 public bus station at the entrance of Jiaotong University, destroying all five buses parked at the two locations. At the same time, they broke the heads of ticket seller Geng Weimin No. 84 and driver No. 926, seriously injuring them. They were sent to Zhongshan Hospital for emergency treatment. In addition, driver Zhang Jiyu No. 744, ticket seller Chen Xiao No. 544, and Lu Zhao'an No. 1032 were also severely beaten and injured. Ticket inspector Pang Peixiang No. 73 was thrown into the river and was sent to the Red Cross Hospital for treatment. Two other drivers were forcibly dragged by the perpetrators to Tianyaoqiao and boarded the truck to escape. The Jing'an Temple Military Police, the First Battalion of the Garrison Headquarters, the Xujiahui Police Station, and the Flying Fortress rushed to the scene after receiving reports, and rescued the two drivers from the truck.</p>
<p>Machine Gun Firing, Fortunately No Disaster Occurred</p>
<p>Unexpectedly, in the chaos, a police car with license plate number 133 from the Xujiahui Police Station was also destroyed. Then, when the military police chased to the vicinity of Hamannan Road and Xietu Road in Longhua, they were suddenly shot at with thirty or forty rounds from machine guns and Thompson submachine guns pre-set up by the Fourth Bureau. The military police were caught off guard and immediately lay down to hide. An officer then ordered that no retaliation was allowed. Fortunately, the other party's targets were inaccurate, and no major disaster occurred. Otherwise, the deaths and injuries would have been unimaginable. Afterwards, the workers retreated to the United Logistics Headquarters Repair Factory, the former site of the Military Governor's Office on Longhua Road.</p>
<p>Nineteen Workers Arrested and Handed Over</p>
<p>While the workers were wantonly destroying vehicles, the military police arrested the perpetrators Zhu Huitang, Hu Zhilai, Diao Guoxian, Li Weiquan, Hong Jinrong, Zhou Shaochun, Chen Jiekang, Chen Chongqing, Chen Guisheng, Li Jinpei, Feng Qiuquan, Gao Yipeng, Cai Baofu, Huang Qiulin, Feng Guozhang, Sheng Anxiang, Shou Renan, and Wang Genyin, totaling eighteen people. They are currently being detained at the Xujiahui Police Station and will be handed over to the Garrison Headquarters for strict handling this morning. The main offender, Pan Liliang, was also transferred by the Jing'an Temple Military Police to the headquarters for handling together.</p>
<p>Decided on Four Aftermath Measures</p>
<p>After the incident, Wu Duo, Chief of Staff of the Port Command, Li Guochen, Director of the Shanghai Office of the Ordnance Bureau of the United Logistics Headquarters, Pan Longyun, Captain of the Third Battalion of the Garrison Headquarters, Ye Qing, Captain of the Jing'an Temple Military Police, Xu Linhai, Supervisory Director of the Municipal Police Bureau, Zhang Zhen, Chief of the Xujiahui Police Station, and Wang Zongshan, Head of the Transportation Section of the Public Utilities Bureau, held a meeting to discuss the aftermath measures. It was decided that: (1) The main offenders and accomplices will be investigated and handed over to the Garrison Headquarters for strict handling; (2) The Ordnance Bureau will compensate the Public Utilities Bureau for the loss of vehicles; (3) Bear the medical expenses of the injured; (4) Guarantee that similar incidents will not occur in the future. If there are any deaths due to injuries in this incident, another meeting will be held to discuss the matter.</p>
<p>This matter was finally resolved at 7:55 PM, and traffic, which had been suspended for nearly seven hours, resumed at 8:00 PM.</p>
<p>After investigation, the public transportation company lost 150 pieces of glass, 34.3 million yuan in ticket stubs and cash, and 50 million yuan in repair costs for the Xujiahui ticket booth.</p>

<p>The Municipal Chamber of Commerce, regarding the Legislative Yuan's discussion of the Provisional Property Tax Regulations, cabled the Legislative Yuan, strongly stating the reasons why the tax cannot be established. Now, the Chamber of Commerce believes that this matter is of great importance to the national economy and the people's livelihood. In case of a hasty decision, it will inevitably lead to more confusion, and a motion for reconsideration should be made to show balance. Only the President can exercise the constitutional power to convey his political views in advance and properly guide the situation. With this consistent belief, the Chamber of Commerce specifically telegraphed the Secretary-General of the Presidential Office, stating the reasons why the property tax bill should not be established, and requested that it be forwarded to the President for a wise decision.</p>

<h3 id="e89">Tongji Student Protest Case: Eight Defendants Found Not Guilty, Prosecutor Files Appeal <a href="#e89" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c89" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">89</a></h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] In the Tongji student protest case, the eight defendants Huang Kelu, Pan Chengbang, Wang Zongshu, Zhou Yongzhi, Zhang Jingyao, Sun Kema, Qu Yuping, and Wang Weixin were accused of disrupting public order. The High Court acquitted them and exempted them from punishment on the 14th of this month. Prosecutor Lin Houqi refused to accept the verdict and filed an appeal. The reasons are as follows: (1) Huang Kelu, Pan Chengbang, Wang Zongshu, Sun Kema, Wang Weixin, and Zhang Jingyao: Huang and Pan were the chairmen of the Tongji student protest delegation, and the presidium was the leader of the protest team. The presidium issued orders for students to rush out of the school gate, causing the order at that time to fall into chaos. The defendants should be responsible for the crime of publicly gathering and using violence and coercion. The defendant Wang Zongshu was a member of the Standing Committee, and the defendant Wang Weixin was the commander-in-chief of the protest delegation, both of which are supported by evidence. The defendant Zhang Jingyao admitted in the police station that he held a protest flag and rushed towards the surrounding police officers and was arrested on the spot. The defendant Sun Kema crossed the ditch to beat Mayor Wu. Not only did Zhu Yifu's testimony clearly prove it, but the defendant also admitted in the police station that he was impolite to the mayor. There is no doubt that these people jointly carried out acts of violence and coercion in public. The original judgment held that they were all specific students and there was no situation of continuous increase, which did not meet the requirements for a public gathering. If that is the case, then all riots by troops or workers would not meet the requirements for a public gathering, and the legal interpretation is inappropriate. Moreover, the original judgment did not investigate whether the thousands of people who gathered were all students, and it was also based on speculation. Although their criminal behavior also violated the crime of obstructing official duties, the crime of disrupting public order cannot be abandoned. (2) Qu Yuping and Zhou Yongzhi: The investigation found that the defendant Qu Yuping was the one who beat the mayor at that time, as testified by witness Zhang Jugong on record. During the initial trial, he mistakenly identified another person as the defendant, because the time had passed for too long and his memory was unclear. The original judgment held that Zhang Jugong and the defendant were familiar with each other, and his testimony was inconsistent, so it was deemed unreliable, which was a misunderstanding. Since the defendant did beat Mayor Wu, there is no doubt that he should bear the responsibility for publicly gathering and implementing acts of violence and coercion. As for the defendant Zhou Yongzhi, witness Jiang Hong testified: "I heard that Zhou Yongzhi pushed the mayor down, which was a very proud thing to do." Combined with the testimony of witness Zhu Yifu: "Zhou Yongzhi rushed over the ditch," it is clear that he participated in the violence. Taking a step back, even if the defendant did not beat Mayor Wu, but at that time the mayor was standing by the ditch when the students were beating him in a dangerous situation, and the defendant suddenly rushed over from the thirtieth team across the ditch (see the defendant's statement), it is also clear that he had reached the degree of implementing coercion, and it is difficult to excuse him from the crime of publicly gathering and implementing acts of violence and coercion. The original judgment acquitted them all, which is inappropriate.</p>

<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Since the Bethany Orphanage began soliciting funds for the construction of a new site, donors have been very enthusiastic. Our newspaper received a letter from the Children's Service Society of Soochow Academy Elementary School yesterday, which stated: "We read about the Bethany Orphanage in the newspaper and felt very sad. Our teachers also told us about the lives of those orphans, and we were very moved. God has given us parents to take care of us and good schools to study in. We cannot forget to love those children without parents. Therefore, we decided to save five days of snack money, put it together, and send it to you, sir, to be forwarded. This 5.7 million yuan is not a large amount, but we hope it can comfort those children, and we also hope that children in other schools will do the same, so that the children of Bethany can have a new home to live in as soon as possible."</p>
<h3 id="e91">Cheng Cangbo Returns from Abroad, Gives Speech Yesterday on Today's World <a href="#e91" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c91" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">91</a></h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Legislator and News Paper Publisher Cheng Cangbo, who attended the World Press Conference, gave a speech at the Zhapu Road Cultural Hall at 2:00 PM yesterday, talking about his observations of Europe and the United States, titled "Today's World." Cheng listed the conspiratorial activities of communists in various European and American countries. Although Stalin declared that the Third International had been dissolved, in fact, the underground activities of the Third International have intensified. Fortunately, various European and American countries have seen through their deceit and have risen up to stop them, such as the failure of the Communist Party in Italy and the passage of bills by the US Congress to punish Communist Parties that mislead the country. In short, today's world is not the only country suffering from the Red Scare. The conspiracy is actually aimed at the entire world. Moreover, from all aspects, communism cannot coexist with other ideologies because it denies all factors other than material, and it denies human nature and personality. Today, the United States is leading the Western democracies in the fight against communism. Leftists use the collapse of American capitalism for propaganda. In fact, the general material life in the United States has reached a very high level. Although prices are higher than before the war, the multiple of wage income is still higher. Moreover, its federal legislation is gradually moving towards the road of socialism, so the United States shows no signs of decline or corruption. When I (Cheng said himself) returned to China, I passed through San Francisco, where a "I am an American" festival was being held. Americans were proud to be Americans, and their firm self-confidence was admirable. I especially call on all compatriots across the country today. We should also be proud to be Chinese, take responsibility for ourselves, and believe that our Republic of China will achieve prosperity and freedom.</p>

<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The opening ceremony of the Hengfeng Road Bridge in the city was held at 10:00 AM yesterday. A white cloth banner was hung in the center of the bridge, with the words "For the Opening Ceremony of the New Hengfeng Road Bridge, Prosper the City and Benefit the People." Red and green ribbons were hung at the southern end. Residents gathered at both ends of the bridge, reaching thousands of people. The ceremony was presided over by Mayor Wu. Attendees included Zhao Zukang, Xu Ji**, Chen Baotai, Ouyang Zunming, Li Ximou, Wang Shengshan, Xiang Changquan, and Ding Guitang. After Mayor Wu led the ceremony, he delivered a speech stating: During the former concession period, the various constructions in the city can be said to be complete. However, during the enemy's period, there was only destruction and no construction. After the victory, everything was waiting to be done. At present, the most important problem in the city is municipal construction. Generally speaking, the restoration of Nanshi focuses on the construction of docks, and the restoration of Zhabei focuses on the construction of bridges. The completion of the Hengfeng Road Bridge is just one of the construction plans."</p>
<p>Then, Zhao Zukang, Director of the Public Works Bureau, reported on the construction process and expressed three hopes: (1) Citizens must love the bridges (2) Other bridges can be built in order. (3) The Zhabei West District hopes to gradually complete the urban planning and road system. Zhao said: The construction of the Hengfeng Bridge is based on the principle of economic practicality. It is not as beautiful as the Sichuan Road Bridge and the Henan Road Bridge, but the bridge body is strong. The total length of the bridge is 52.73 meters, the span of the side holes is 10.36 meters, and the middle three holes are a total of 105 feet wide. The bridge is 17.47 meters wide, including an 11.89-meter carriageway and a 2.179-meter pedestrian walkway, which can accommodate four cars in parallel. The total cost of labor and materials is more than 3 billion yuan in national currency.</p>
<p>At 10:25, after the speech was completed, Mayor Wu presided over the ribbon-cutting ceremony. The music was melodious, and the citizens on both sides applauded and cheered. Mayor Wu led the way in a car, followed by the vehicles of the heads of various agencies. The opening ceremony was then completed.</p>

<h3 id="e100">Affected by the Rampant Rise in Off-Site Prices, Rice Price Hikes Continue Unabated: Grain Administration Authorities Once Dumped 6,000 Shi of Rice on the Market <a href="#e100" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c100" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">100</a></h3>
<p>[Our Report] Rice prices continue to rise relentlessly. Yesterday, the retail price was 11 million yuan per shi, and there is still a continuing upward trend. Yesterday, the grain administration authorities sold 6,000 shi of rice to supply the market, but this was like a drop in the bucket and could not stop the rising trend.</p>
<p>After Guan Jiyu, the Minister of Food, came to Shanghai the day before yesterday, rice merchants in the city were wary and rice prices were temporarily stable. However, Minister Guan hurriedly returned to Beijing after consulting with Mayor Wu. Even Ren Xianqun, the chairman of the Shanghai People's Opinion Survey Committee, was unable to meet with Minister Guan.</p>
<p>Yesterday morning, Ren Xianqun, chairman of the People's Opinion Survey Committee, Huang Jiaju, a specialist committee member of the municipal government, and Gu Mingzhai, chief of the Grain Section of the Social Bureau, were stationed at the market. At the opening of the market, Chairman Ren announced the sale of 6,000 shi of rice, with 3,000 shi each for the north and south markets, at a price of 9.2 million yuan per shi. Public sentiment tended to weaken and asking prices fell. However, around 10:00 AM, prices for all commodities outside the market rose sharply. Cigarettes and soap rose by 20%, and gold and paper money also strengthened. At the same time, the money supply was too loose, and promissory notes were flying around in the market. Rice prices then rose again. The grain officials stationed at the market sighed at their inability to do anything.</p>
<p>Yesterday's rice prices in the North Market: Top White Japonica 10.3 million yuan, Thin Indica 10.02 million yuan, Early Rice 10.005 million yuan, Sheep Xiang 10.03 million yuan. Rice prices in the South Market: Top White Japonica 10 million yuan, Medium Thin Indica 10 million yuan, Early Rice 9.9 million yuan. Arrivals in the North Market were 1,885 shi, and arrivals in the South Market were 3,046 shi, for a total of 4,931 shi. The amount of rice supplied was 6,000 shi.</p>
<p>Flour prices followed the rise of all commodities and soared again. The Central Trust Bureau still did not release any flour, which further strengthened public sentiment. The loose money supply further fueled the buying trend. Army Ship Flour alone rose to 3.5 million yuan, and Old Car Flour to 3.51 million yuan, up 260,000 to 300,000 yuan. Red Bee and Jiancheng were also available, with the former at 3.35 million yuan and the latter at 3.4 million yuan. Large-bag wheat bran was 3.05 million yuan, up 200,000 yuan, and wheat opened at 4.7 million yuan.</p>
<p>The price of miscellaneous grains did not fall. Public sentiment remained strong, and sellers continued to raise prices. Soybeans rose by over 300,000 yuan. Hankou New Beans closed at 5.9 million yuan. Corn prices were expected to rise further, increasing by about 400,000 yuan. Although the sales of mung beans and red sorghum were not high, prices also rose by 200,000 to 300,000 yuan due to the support of sellers. The arrival of new broad beans was still high, and consumer appetite waned, causing the market to stabilize. Yuan wheat rose by 200,000 to 300,000 yuan. Sesame prices were only slightly firm yesterday after rising sharply the day before. Uncooked peanuts from Guangzhou lacked consumer interest and fell by 500,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Edible oil prices continued to rise, and the market was even firmer at the close, with even higher prices. Although sellers initially raised prices along with the rise in grain prices in the morning, prices at the close were 500,000 yuan higher than at the opening. Dachang New Soybean Oil opened at 23.7 million yuan, and Datong Soybean Oil closed at 24.3 million yuan, up about 1.6 million yuan. Jittong Crude Oil was 32 million yuan, up 2 million yuan. Crude vegetable oil opened at 22.5 million yuan and rose to 23 million yuan later in the market. Small Car Sesame Oil rose again to 32.8 million yuan, and soybean cake rose by 180,000 to 190,000 yuan.</p>

<p>Chinese stocks had an upward trend yesterday but fluctuated. Although Yong Yarn reached a new high, it was extremely vulnerable near closing. This was attributed to rumors that the President would take decisive action and that state-owned stocks would be listed.</p>
<p>The market opened strong in the morning. There were reports that the Minister of Finance had resigned. Yong Yarn opened high at 3,980 yuan, but was sold down to 3,935 yuan. Due to the unusually high demand for yarn and cloth, it rose to a new high of 4,020 yuan. Agency fees opened high at 33 yuan and 37 yuan, but retreated to 3,920 yuan. However, foreign stocks and yarn and cloth prices remained strong, and there were some rebounds.

<p>Yesterday, the cotton yarn market saw constant buying from all sides due to the still loose money supply, and sentiment within the market was largely bullish. 42-count Blue Phoenix fine yarn jumped by about 30 million at the opening. Subsequently, with both new buying and short covering, and strong interest from Tianjin, Guangdong and other regional traders, the market frequently flew to new highs, and closed at a new high price of 590 million yuan, a further sharp increase of 66 million yuan compared to the previous day. Other coarse and fine yarns also rose by more than 10%.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the cotton cloth market saw prices continue to soar as yarn prices continued to fly high, and the market was awash with capital. There was a large amount of hoarding and buying, and short covering was urgent. Large traders were active, and 12-pound Dragon Head fine cloth initially opened 600,000 higher due to frequent positive news, and sellers were only willing to sell at that price. Subsequently, as buying interest from regional traders slackened, the market trended weaker, but it was immediately heard that dyeing factories and the oil industry were secretly buying up large quantities, the market was strongly bullish, and the market once again set a new record of 118 million yuan.</p>
<p>After 10:00 AM, traders from Tianjin sold at high prices, and over-the-counter traders also sold to take profits, while the Textile Construction Bureau allocated supplies, leading to a temporary decline mid-day.

<h3 id="e107">After the Announcement of the New Exchange Settlement Measures: Export Industry Provides Opinions: Several Technical Issues Must Be Resolved <a href="#e107" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c107" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">107</a></h3>
<p>[Our Report] In order to understand the impact of the new exchange settlement rules stipulated in Circular No. 134 on the export industry, the Export Control Committee recently invited more than 20 export industry leaders to exchange views, presided over by Chen Junren, Director of the Export Promotion Department. The export industry believes that the new exchange settlement method is more reasonable in principle, and the interests of the import and export industries can be balanced as a result. However, in order for this method to achieve the expected results, several technical issues must be resolved reasonably, such as whether the issuance of import licenses can be coordinated with exchange settlement certificates, and whether the Central Bank can adjust its position so that exchange settlement certificates can have reasonable prices, etc. Summarizing the opinions of various exporters, the most important points are as follows: (1) Technical issues of exchange settlement certificates: (A) The 7-day deadline is too short, please allow a reasonable extension; (B) The designated banks should agree on reasonable prices according to the supply and demand of exchange settlement certificates to allow free buying and selling; (C) Importers should be allowed to retain the foreign exchange of their permitted imports, and more import licenses should be issued to seek a balance; (D) The exchange rate of the Balance Committee should be frozen, or the exchange settlement certificate should be annotated with "This certificate will be settled at the exchange rate of the Balance Committee on the same day" to avoid losses to exporters who have not sold their exchange settlement certificates when the exchange rate changes. (2) Export visa system should be adopted to prevent underreporting of prices; (3) Packing loans should be continued; (4) Procurement methods should be continued; (5) Smuggling should be eliminated; (6) The yarn and cloth industry provides opinions that the new exchange settlement method should also be applied to yarn and cloth exports; At the same time, there are too many export appraisal agencies, and their unification should be sought. Exporters also hope that the Export Control Committee can maintain contact with the export industry in the future and communicate opinions from time to time.</p>

<p>The Liǎngjiāng Women's Physical Education College swimming pool on Wèi Jīmài Road was opened to the public last summer and was well received. Since the beginning of summer this year, the weather has been oppressively hot, and swimming enthusiasts have visited several times in the past week. The site has been undergoing repairs to the water pump and internal renovations, which have taken time, and it has not yet opened. It has now been decided to officially open on Sunday morning of this week at 10:00 AM, which is expected to be a grand occasion.</p>
<p>Another report states that although the Zhōnghuá Youth Association swimming pool on Sìchuān Road is small, it cultivates nearly a thousand new talents every year. The warm water swimming season has just ended, and the swimming pool is undergoing repairs and preparing for this summer's swimming season. However, due to the sharp rise in prices this year, the association is facing great difficulties, especially as the cost of water, electricity, labor, and pool water chemicals has exceeded last year's by a hundredfold. The budget for expenses, including repairs, has reached 1 billion yuan. Considering the burden on participants, the fees cannot be too high, so the association's thousand-person swimming program this summer will be reduced to a maximum of 600 people to save costs. It is reported that the association's swimming pool will be open from July 1st to the end of August. The swimming classes are still divided into beginner, intermediate, advanced, self-study, women's, and group classes, using the latest accelerated scientific teaching methods. Registration will begin on the 20th of this month at the association's inquiry office.

<h3 id="e127">World Games Delegation Accused of Inappropriate Measures: Sports Circles in Beijing File Complaint, Petitioning Minister of Education Zhū for Thorough Investigation <a href="#e127" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c127" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">127</a></h3>
<p>[Report from This Newspaper, Nanjing] Forty-two members of the Nanjing sports community, including Chén Jūnmó, Xú Rǔkāng, and Yuán Zhònglián, expressed dissatisfaction with the various measures taken by our country's World Games delegation and petitioned Minister of Education Zhū Jiāhuá, requesting a thorough investigation, withholding passports, and strict review. They also requested that the secretary-general of the delegation, Dǒng Shǒuyì, publicly respond. The points of criticism in the letter to Minister Zhū are as follows:</p>
<p>Creating Pretexts to Place Personal Connections</p>
<p>(1) The selection of World Games athletes has qualified standards and strict restrictions to avoid indiscriminate participation. However, the delegation, which has nothing to do with the actual competition, is creating pretexts to arbitrarily place personal connections, resulting in a number far exceeding the number of athletes. Apart from the football team, which has already left the country, the three teams for basketball, track and field, and swimming have only 14 athletes in total, while the delegation staff includes over ten positions such as the head of the delegation, secretary-general, consultant, leader, instructor, manager, secretary, Chinese secretary, English secretary, head coach, staff, assistant staff, and attendants, totaling twenty to thirty people. Among them, only seven or eight are sports professionals, while the rest are either merchants or businessmen. It is said that these people are seeking to go abroad for other commercial purposes. If this is the case, it will only become an international joke.</p>
<p>Deceiving the Government, Engaging in Self-interest and Collusion</p>
<p>(2) The former Ministry of Education had plans to organize a World Games sports observation group, but as the World Games delegation is about to depart, there is no news of the observation group. What benefits can so many non-sports personnel in the delegation bring to the future of Chinese sports, other than sightseeing and pursuing their private purposes? It is said that some of them are going abroad at their own expense, but the delegation is creating pretexts for them and securing passports, which is a waste of foreign exchange and deceiving the government. The organizers are suspected of engaging in self-interest and collusion.</p>
<p>Raising Funds Without Authorization, Taking Foreign Planes</p>
<p>(3) The Ministry of Education has already subsidized the delegation with US$25,000. The organizers of the delegation are expanding the organization without authorization. On the one hand, they are claiming insufficient funds and soliciting donations everywhere, but the amount received has not been made public. On the other hand, they are unwilling to accept the preferential treatment of China National Aviation Corporation and are taking foreign planes, spending over US$9,000 more. The purpose of this is baffling.</p>

<h3 id="e128">The Authenticity of Literature <a href="#e128" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c128" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">128</a></h3>
<p>— Tāng Kuāngyíng</p>
<p>Didn't Tolstoy say that art is a beautiful lie?</p>
<p>Perhaps it's because they excessively believe in art, that in novels, plays, and various stories, authors intentionally exaggerate many colors, making readers like spectators in front of a magician, being subjected to sleight of hand and told enormous lies. In the meantime, it is precisely because everyone has this idea in their minds: "This is just a fictional construct from the writers' pens!"</p>
<p>Those who take literature as social realism inevitably get seen as the biggest fools. Everyone thinks that the lack of authenticity in literary content seems to be a foregone conclusion. In fact, in recent years, everyone has been merely praising the greatness of this era. In terms of literary works, we have novels depicting the heroic battles on the front lines, works depicting the exchange of light and darkness in the rear, and many writings filled with nostalgia and talent. But in the midst of all this, is there a new god that is realistic enough? That is a big question mark. The saying that art is the biggest lie is their creed. So, only some people are hiding in dark corners, shouting "Enough, enough" at the endless flow of works; while some writers rarely think that their pens are merely cameras, and even though they capture mountains, rivers, grass, and trees on film, they lack a soul inside.</p>
<p>Originally, art or literature is a record of social consciousness and the image of the social reality, expressed through words; it should be a record of life. Writers solemnly take it to the heart, and whether it's the universe or a tiny fly, there is a spiritual sustenance, so that art does not become a soulless, exquisite photograph, but has its own inherent authenticity.</p>
<p>Some people say that the appreciation of literature is multifaceted. An archaeologist only knows to pay attention to broken bowls and shattered porcelain, a history enthusiast only cares about the age and background of the work, while an aestheticist only cares about the richness of the words. Therefore, those who argue against it insist on this point, arguing that although literature is a realistic depiction of facts that may occur in society, it cannot be said that literature has no existence at all apart from this element. This statement seems to have a few distorted reasons on the surface, but after revealing it, this is actually another deception. Whether it is broken bowls and shattered porcelain in the hands of an archaeologist, ancient poetry and songs in the hands of a historian, or a hymn in the hands of an aestheticist, but those as literary works, in a certain period of time in the past, undeniably reflect the image of the social consciousness and the social reality of that era. For example, the fragments of paper in the Dūnhuáng Thousand Buddha Caves today are merely historical relics in the hands of an archaeologist, but in the hands of a social scholar, they are also a living record of that era.</p>
<p>In fact, looking back at the various records in the history of Chinese literature, realistic depictions were regarded as the standard by some progressive literati thousands of years ago. Although in this distant history, the literature praising feudalism and the emperor was too bloated, some places were inevitably exaggerated in literary displays; but great works of literature are often a reflection of the real environment and the social persecution. Confucius' Spring and Autumn Annals, Qu Yuan's Lisao, and Zuo Si's Rhapsody on the Three Capitals are all persecutions of reality and critiques of society, but each person's literary techniques are a bit different, but their goals are the same.</p>
<p>Therefore, today, some scholars, after carefully examining the current literary environment in China, believe that the May Fourth Literary Revolution did open up a new situation in the Chinese literary scene, which had been dull for so long, but because of subsequent complacency, some shallow scholars only brought in some foreign literary dregs, and destroyed and scattered the inherent strengths of Chinese literature. This is really not a harsh statement. It has been more than twenty years from the May Fourth Movement to now. Although this time is not long, it is not short either. Even if the literary world before the May Fourth Movement was chaotic, we should now have drawn a clue. Moreover, we estimate that the impression given to people by this eight-year sacred War of Resistance, in all aspects, will not be reduced compared to the situation in the May Fourth era. So now there should be a more amazing and novel discovery in the reform of literature in our country. However, where is the so-called literary discovery today? Although works are being manufactured in the literary factory, what else is there besides becoming a literary disaster, glittering and dazzling?</p>
<p>However, to bring the topic back, in this era, the social turmoil and the attachment of material conditions for some writers are an irreparable regret for literature. Writers often cannot achieve a balanced development in emotion and writing because they are forced by these two conditions. The so-called balanced development of emotions and words is like what Ms. Bīng Xīn said in her book "To Young Readers": "When words are more than emotions, and emotions are more than words, it is not the time to write an article." Because when emotions cannot control words, words lose their authenticity; when words lose emotions, emotions lose their existence; words and emotions are a body and soul, and the writer's pen is the breathing tube between this body and soul.</p>
<p>After the victory, everyone sighed in disappointment, wondering why there were not more great works with authenticity being produced. In fact, because of the constraints of the two conditions above, writers are afraid to persecute reality; because it is something that cannot be done for a poor writer who only cares about food and clothing and has no time to settle down. In the eyes of onlookers, it is something that writers do not do; but they are neglecting that this era is using a giant lever to press on the backs of writers to make them prostrate and submit?</p>
<p>We certainly recognize that this era is great, and we certainly recognize that art is not a beautiful lie; we certainly recognize that writers should try their best to describe the things that may happen in this great era, and describe its living authenticity; but we also have a more important request: that writers should have a more powerful guarantee in life.</p>
<h3 id="e129">My Family's Flower <a href="#e129" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c129" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">129</a></h3>
<p>— Shòu Juān</p>
<p>——Violet, Miscellany</p>
<p>The great Confucian scholar Zhōu Liánxī of the Song Dynasty wrote "On the Love of Lotus," giving the highest praise to the lotus flower that emerges from the mud without being stained. He was truly a confidant of the lotus flower, so later generations nominated Lord Liánxī as the Flower God of June for the twelve months of the year. I, in my humble life, am content with simplicity and have never had the ambition to attach myself to the powerful. However, I am happy to associate myself with flowers and trees, simply because my surname is Zhōu, and the ancestral hall name passed down through generations happens to be "Love of Lotus." Therefore, I must attach myself to this noble flower and unceremoniously call it "My Family's Flower."</p>
<p>The lotus has the most aliases: Fúlián, Fúróng, Water Zhī, Òuhuā, Water Yún, Water Dàn, Water Brush, Zézhī, Yùhuán, and the most common is Hèhuā. Now everyone commonly calls it Lotus or Hèhuā, and no longer uses other names. The lotus also has a particularly large number of varieties, including the Twin Lotus, Four-Faced Lotus, First-Class Lotus, Thousand-Petaled Lotus, Double-Decked Lotus, etc. There are also other bizarre and wonderful varieties that have long been unique and impossible to collect. It is unknown when the lotus began, but it does have a birthday, which is the 24th day of the sixth month of the lunar calendar. It is also unknown who decided this day for it. The custom in Wú calls this day the Guānshù Festival. Ladies in the Wú region often take painted boats with flutes and drums to view the lotuses in the Lotus Pond outside Fēng Gate. Nowadays, life is difficult, and everyone no longer has such leisure and elegance. The poet Xú Hóngzhāi of the Qing Dynasty wrote two poems on the birthday of the lotus: "The summer heat subsides before the lotus leaves in the wind, and the river flows at the mouth of the lotus pond; today is the lotus' birthday, and my wife and I open the boat together." "The official of Jīntán, Duàn Chángqīng, sings quietly in the wind; strange, his face is as beautiful as the lotus, and he was born on the birthday of the lotus." Flower historians can use this as material.</p>
<p>Throughout ancient and modern times, the poems, prose, lyrics, and allusions about the lotus flower are too numerous to count. In the future, when I am in a better mood, I plan to compile a special collection to promote my family's flower. The oldest prose is the "Memorial to the Throne from the Hundred Officials Congratulating on the Auspicious Thousand-Petaled Lotus" by Cui Rong of the Tang Dynasty. Mǐn Hóng of the Han Dynasty and Cao Zhi of the Wei Dynasty each have a "Lotus Rhapsody." The oldest poem is probably the anonymous ancient poem "Crossing the River to Pick Lotus, Many Fragrant Herbs in the Orchid Marsh, Who to Give What Is Picked, My Thoughts Are on a Distant Road..." As for the several great poets of the Tang Dynasty, almost all have a "Lotus Picking Song," which is even more beautiful.</p>
<p>One day after the lotus' birthday last summer, my brother Táo Lěngyuè returned to Sūzhōu from Shanghai. Brother Chéng Xiǎoqīng hired a boat and invited me and brothers Fàn Yānqiáo and Hé Shìxīn to go to the Lotus Pond to view the lotuses. Although we did not go deep into the pond, we did see many graceful white lotuses, appearing unstained by dust, making people sigh like Lù Lǔwàng, "This flower is truly fit to be in the Jade Pool." Zhōngshān Park is not far from my home. There are two lotus ponds in the park, one large and one small, planted with red lotuses, which are bright and lovely. I have visited twice to admire them, lingering and forgetting to return when looking at the clusters of green canopies and red buds. As for the lotus pond under the Mei Qiu of my home, although there are white and light red varieties, more than a dozen bloomed last year, but the area is too small, and only two or three bloom at the same time, which is not enough to satisfy the eye. The old Four-Faced Guānyīn was extinct during the occupation period. Last spring, several red lotus branches were transplanted from the park, which grew leaves but did not bloom. I can only wait until this year. Senior fellow villager, Mr. Pān Jìrú, collects and plants potted lotuses, with as many as seven famous varieties such as Layered Terrace, Sprinkled Gold, and White Lotus with Inlaid Edges. I went to admire them and found them difficult to describe. Old Mr. Jì promised to give me some roots next spring, which made me overjoyed. My old friend, Brother Jiǎng Yínqiū, also promised to transplant one or two twin lotuses and Four-Faced Guānyīn from the Kě Garden in the library. He also said that he has an old friend, Mr. Lú Bīnshì, who is the only expert in Wúzhōng who cultivates bowl lotuses, and can bloom red and white lotuses in a small bowl. He pre-arranged to give me a bowl as a table decoration for the Hall of Love of Lotus when the lotus flowers bloom this year. Last summer, in memory of my late wife, Fèngjūn, I specially planted famous varieties of Phoenix Immortals (Balsam) outside the Phoenix Coming Ceremony Room. After autumn, they still bloomed brilliantly, so last year can be said to be the year of the Phoenix Immortals, and this year should be the year of the lotus. If the results are not bad, then on the 24th day of the sixth month of the lunar calendar, I will definitely invite worthy friends to raise a glass to celebrate the birthday of my family's flower.</p>

<p>Life is all confusion and sadness</p>
<p>Whenever a beautiful story begins</p>
<p>So you also once picked up a pen to contemplate</p>
<p>Carrying the burden of life and embarking on a new path</p>
<p>You said what else can you say to me</p>
<p>Surely afraid of being tormented by emotion</p>
<p>The foolishness of love has already fallen before your eyes</p>
<p>Just wanting to get rid of the worries of the distance</p>
<p>But it makes you feel fear again</p>
<p>Enduring the pain and wandering in the wilderness</p>
<p>Just like a young deer escaping the hunter</p>
<p>It is difficult to find a secluded valley</p>
<p>Borrow an oar from wisdom</p>
<p>Learn from that small boat going against the current</p>
<p>Fully loaded with a boat of clear sorrow</p>
<p>Remotely pointing to the dawn of the end of the world</p>
<p>You will steady the rudder of reason</p>
<p>I said why say anything more</p>
<p>Wait until the fading years grow old</p>
<p>Instruct the surroundings to leave a piece of silence</p>
<p>To recognize this accidental infatuation</p>
<p>Who takes love as the truth</p>
<p>No need to pick up a pen to contemplate anymore</p>
<p>The universe will always contain mystery</p>

<p>— Zhao Jingshen</p>
<p>Recent Italian Literary Scene</p>
<p>From the outside, Italian bookstores appear very appealing, filled with beautifully bound art books and travel guides in cheerful colors. However, upon entering, one is often disappointed, as the books on offer are much the same as in other European countries. A stranger seeking to understand the general trends and interests of the Italian intelligentsia will primarily find titles like "Amber," Hersey's "Hiroshima," and novels by Koestler, who recently visited America from England. This enthusiasm for foreign works is common throughout Europe, and Italy is no exception. They translate not only English, French, and American works, but also modern German and Soviet literature. They publish numerous Soviet plays, essays, and short stories, as well as collections of individual authors, such as the collected works of Ehrenburg, and even translated a history of Russian literature. Works by modern German writers such as Jaspers and Weill are also widely translated.</p>
<p>Italy's interest in foreign works is much greater than that of England and France. This is partly because after twenty years of Fascist oppression, they are eager to catch up on what they missed. Years ago, Megaro's "The Achievements of Mussolini" and Heiden's "Hitler" were republished, alongside biographies of figures like Ilya Ehrenburg and Stalin.</p>
<p>Writers who were banned by Mussolini in the 1920s and 30s have once again aroused great interest among readers. Names such as Salvemini, Sturzo, Sforza, Nitti, and Borgese have regained prominence in the Italian literary scene.</p>
<p>Among the anti-Fascist writers is Antonio Gramsci, whose literary works are only now becoming known, though he died ten years ago. Before Mussolini came to power, Gramsci was a member of parliament. He was later imprisoned under Fascist rule and remained incarcerated until 1937. He was released due to serious illness and died shortly after. It is said that the reason he had to be imprisoned was to "prevent a mind like his for twenty years." But even though the Fascists isolated him from the outside world, they could not paralyze his spirit. In prison, he continued to correspond with friends and write. His collection of letters has been published and hailed as a masterpiece of Italian literature.</p>
<p>These letters are notable not only for their political ideas but also for their literary technique. The letters discuss philosophy, history, and economics, his thought bridging the gap between Croce's idealism and Karl's materialism. His letters will become an important source for understanding the Italian intellectual class of the last thirty years. Especially admirable is his perspective on life and scientific objectivity. Despite external pressures and worsening illness, he retained the strength of a hero, fighting against danger and refusing to be dragged down by it.</p>
<p>In pure literature, two books are noteworthy: one is Carlo Levi's "Christ Stopped at Eboli," which has already been translated into English. The other is Giuseppe Berto's "The Sky is Red," written by the young author while still a prisoner of war. It seems to have been influenced by Erskine Caldwell’s "God's Little Acre," with each chapter describing the reconstruction of a bombed city.</p>
<p>Italian novels do not pay much attention to new psychological methods or stylistic experiments; they focus more on content than form.</p>

<p>Abundant Wealth is Often a Curse for Descendants: Mother and Son Turn Against Each Other Over Inheritance</p>
<p>Lin Baocheng asks: My friend, Mr. Jia, has always had a poor relationship with his mother (Yi). In the 31st year of the Republic (1942), Jia's father passed away, and Yi intended to separate from Jia according to the will (Jia was already married at the time). However, Jia's income was insufficient to support his wife and child, so he was unable to carry out the separation. After Jia's father's death, all of the inheritance remained in his mother's hands. Now, Jia is requesting a division of the property and has a few questions: (1) The will does not specify the amount or nature of the inheritance. Now, Yi claims that she has already consumed it all. Can Jia deny this? (2) Is the eldest son not responsible for the living expenses of his mother and younger brother if he has not received any inheritance? (3) If the two brothers have not separated their households, is it legal for the younger brother to falsely claim that the elder brother's property is part of their father's inheritance and demand a share?</p>
<p>[Lawyer Jiang Pingfan answers:] (1) Since the will does not specify the inheritance and there is no evidence of the amount of the inheritance, Jia cannot claim to divide his father's inheritance from his mother, Yi. (2) Since Yi is Jia's mother, Jia has a legal obligation to support her. Whether or not Jia has the ability to support her is a matter of fact. If Yi is unable to support herself and Jia is able to support her but deliberately fails to do so, he is guilty of abandonment. (3) The younger brother cannot falsely claim that the elder brother's property is part of their father's inheritance and demand a share.</p>

<h3 id="e137">Contribution <a href="#e137" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c137" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">137</a></h3>
<p>— Qian Wen</p>
<p>Since the legendary Yellow Emperor invented the south-pointing chariot, the Chinese nation has made many contributions to mankind; the recent victory over the invading countries is also a contribution.</p>
<p>After the victory, what other contributions are there? During the war, others created many novel things, not to mention the atomic bomb. Even defeated Germany produced rocket weapons that the victorious nations had to learn from and improve. Others invented DDT and the jeep, things that even our young children can name. What do we have? We have nothing much to boast about in modern times. However, we have never led but have always followed, and we are not too far behind. So, when others see flying saucers in the sky, we also see them, proving that we are not too far behind. As for observing solar eclipses, I heard that middle school students can participate. There was no report after the observation because the weather was not good, and it was not the observers' fault.</p>
<p>Suddenly, I thought of the pandas that were going to fly to America a few years ago. Pandas prove that our country has vast land and abundant resources, just as others have unearthed someone or other, and we have unearthed a Peking Man in Zhoukoudian. These are all contributions. Among our various contributions in the past three years, the most earth-shattering is "the egg standing up on the first day of spring." This is the first major discovery after the victory, and it belongs to us. Although this discovery makes Einstein laugh, all scientists are honest, and they cannot deny the phenomenon. Perhaps one day in the future, when the egg-standing phenomenon proves to be consistently successful, a wise man among us will come forward and propose the principle of egg-standing, spreading it to the world. At that time, we can tease Mr. Einstein a bit and say, "What's so special about the theory of relativity? Please study my theory of egg-standing." At this time, our new discoveries and new inventions will create new glory. As it is now, it seems that none of Einstein's assistants or close disciples are Chinese.</p>
<p>Pandas are originally a kind of national glory. We originally had more national glories, but they are gradually becoming inferior to pandas. Silk-spinning silkworms, fur-providing beasts, wool, leather, pig bristles, sausage casings, bird feathers, eggs, horses, cattle, sheep, chickens, dogs, pigs, and others are either of poor quality or small in quantity. They are not enough for domestic use, and exports are not smooth, so they are indeed less popular than pandas. Our roosters can lay eggs, which is also a novel product, but unfortunately, it is rarely seen. However, raising a rooster that lays eggs is not without glory. Who dares to say that we will not select the best breeds and keep the good ones, so that all the roosters in the world will not crow but lay eggs?</p>
<p>Of course, we must also mention Miss Yang Mei. Recently, the scientific community's explanation for her not eating is that her body contains chlorophyll. Animals have amphibians, and originally the biological world has two-life forms, one body that combines the abilities of both animals and plants. Moreover, this kind of creature is a human being, and humans are the most intelligent of all things, which is not a false statement. This kind of person is born in our country, is this not another kind of national glory? Now, 470 million people are eagerly awaiting the arrival of American aid food, and one in 470 million people can live without a grain of rice or wheat. Our country is indeed abundant in things (humans are living things), and it may make an incredible contribution to academic research, but unfortunately, it makes no contribution to the stomachs of our compatriots!</p>
<p>I hear that all countries around the world are working hard to increase production, but our country's contribution to people and to ourselves is only a few kinds of information that were included in the records of omens and portents by the historians of previous generations.</p>
<h3 id="e138">The Largest News Agency <a href="#e138" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c138" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">138</a></h3>
<p>— Mao Yi</p>
<p>"W.H. Smith &amp; Son" on Portugal Street in London is one of the world's largest news agencies. It sells more than one million newspapers every day. The sales volume of weekly magazines is close to two million copies.</p>
<p>The business of Smith Company is now not limited to newspapers and magazines. It has expanded to books, stationery, circulating libraries, printing, group purchases, advertising, and binding. It has a total of 1,500 bookstores and newsstands, and another 58 wholesale branches.</p>
<p>Its book department regularly stocks 80,000 different kinds of books, with a total of nearly one million copies. The book collection in each branch is also comparable to this number. Another one million books are circulating in the various libraries. More than 500 branches have rental departments. In addition, the company repairs about 100,000 fountain pens every year.</p>
<p>The head office receives an average of 30,000 letters per week. The annual cost for newspaper subscribers is nearly £50,000. The stamp duty on receipts is £1,000 per year, which shows the prosperity of its business.</p>
<p>The date of establishment of Smith Company cannot be verified. It was probably in 1792, when Henry Walton Smith and his wife Anna were running a small paper shop. Their son, William Henry, later expanded the business a bit. When it was passed down to his son, William Henry II, he obtained the exclusive rights to set up newsstands on the railway lines, so the business developed rapidly and grew by leaps and bounds.</p>
<p>The company employs more than 10,000 people, many of whom have served for more than 30 years. Their positions are not without opportunities for advancement. The company encourages loyal service by promoting colleagues. Many people who were newsboys many years ago have become senior executives of the company. This spirit of Smith Company, regardless of origin, increases the hope and efficiency of its employees, which is one of the factors for its business development.</p>

<p>Mr. Guo Linshuang raised funds for the Guang Zhao Association's People's Hospital, and the famous Cantonese opera actresses Li Xuefang and Zhong Fenghua performed famous plays such as Wang Baochuan and Chu Bawang for charity. This poem is to commemorate the event.</p>
<p>The Guo family in Fenyang has a beautiful demeanor,</p>
<p>Playing in the red carpet is also talented.</p>
<p>I suspect that the general descended from the sky,</p>
<p>And the beauty lowered her voice to persuade him to drink before the horse.</p>
<p>It is difficult to combine the bronze pipa and golden thread,</p>
<p>Such fame and glory cannot be compared with the capital.</p>
<p>A song of Yangchun originally had a purpose,</p>
<p>Heroic loyalty and hometown feelings.</p>
<p>Elegant tunes invade the humble lanes,</p>
<p>Across the river, I sadly listen to the sound of a girl's voice.</p>
<p>Lingnan's Xiao and flute have an extraordinary sound,</p>
<p>Singing alone in Jiangdong is also a magnificent chant.</p>
<h3 id="e140">A Trip to Lingyin Temple <a href="#e140" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c140" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">140</a></h3>
<p>— Banmeng Laoren (Old Man Half-Dream)</p>
<p>Recently, there was a Master Juzan, whose writing style was magnificent and whose poetry was also profound. The abbot of Lingyin Temple, Quefei, asked him to compile a gazetteer of Lingyin Mountain. Master Juzan then printed a small gazetteer of Lingyin, which included: "The Calling Ape Cave is located under Calling Ape Peak. It is initially wide, but gradually narrows as you go deeper. Sometimes you have to crawl on the ground to pass. The ground is all fine sand. You walk about a mile, and when your strength is exhausted, you can come out. There is an inscription by Emperor Qianlong on the wall." I have been to Lingyin many times, and I have visited all the nearby caves, but I have never seen a cave that can be entered for a mile. Reading his description, my curiosity was aroused again, so I went down the mountain, took a public bus, and arrived at the Lingyin Mountain gate. After getting off the bus, I sat for a while on a stone in the Chuncong Pavilion. There was someone selling prayer beads with a shoulder pole, and the price was very cheap, so I bought one. When I took it and played with it, it scattered all over the ground. A little boy picked it up for me, but it was still not enough. Passing the Herun Bridge, commonly called the Second Mountain Gate, it is the shared mountain gate of Lingyin and Tianzhu. Bai Juyi's poem says: "One mountain gate becomes two mountain gates, and two temples are originally separated from one temple." The scene is very different now, and Tianzhu is too far away from here. Entering the Longhong Cave, there is a Ligong Pagoda at the entrance of the cave. Turning to the Thread of Sky, also known as the Jade Tree Cave, the top is transparent, and you can see the sky light. Turning again to the Stalactite Cave, a large stone hangs upside down, like a lotus flower hanging down, hollow and exquisite, with Buddha statues carved all over it, a wonderful scene. When walking, if you are not careful, you can bump your head and forehead. However, among these caves, whether there is a cave that requires crawling for a mile, I searched everywhere but could not find it. There are many doors in the cave, going in and out, with grotesque rocks in a dense formation, in thousands of shapes and forms. Judging from the words "flying from afar" in Feilai Peak, it is very consistent. The people of Hangzhou do not organize the scenery, nor do they add any titles, so visitors cannot delve into the location. They glance at it and pass by, and even if they compare it with the book, there is no way to divide it clearly.</p>
<p>In front of Lingyin Temple, there is Cold Spring Pavilion to the east and Zhaolei Pavilion to the west, built along the stream, all leaning against Feilai Peak. Crossing the stream bridge and going west, ascending about one hundred and several tens of steps, there is a pavilion called Cuiwei, which is a scenic spot in front of Lingyin. I wanted to climb up the mountain road from Cuiwei to reach the top of the peak, but I could not find it. So I went down the pavilion and returned to the Stalactite Cave, turned behind the mountain, found a path to climb up, and ascended to the top of Feilai Peak. The peak is not high. There are two tombs of fallen soldiers built on it. From the top of the peak, going forward, there is a path going straight down. I wanted to turn to the front of the Lingyin Mountain gate, and it was already close, and the tea house was in sight, but the road was slippery and the rocks were rugged, and there was nowhere to put my feet, so I had to turn back to the top of the peak, return to the Stalactite Cave, and return to Longhong before reaching the front of the Lingyin gate. Sitting near the releasing life pond and listening to the gurgling sound of the spring, my legs finally recovered. There is a stone cave under the water of the releasing life pond, exquisite and transparent, and the water makes a sound in it, called Zangliu Cave, but I do not understand what the words "Zangliu" mean.</p>
<p>The beauty of the stone walls of Feilai Peak, and the lush trees in front of Lingyin Temple, and the sound of the springs contending, this scenery is the first among the lakes and mountains of Hangzhou. Those who travel to Hangzhou and visit Lingyin will get the essence of it. But like the top of Feilai Peak, there are not many trees, and there are no pavilions and buildings to decorate it. It is like a beauty, only seeing her face, and her misty temples and wind-blown hair, nothing at all, and brocade clothes and skirts, even less to talk about, which is a pity. For the sake of Lingyin, it seems that a broad road should be opened from Cuiwei Pavilion to ascend to the top of the peak, and trees should be planted all around the peak, and pavilions and buildings should be added to the beautiful places, so that there will be a view of fairy mountains and pavilions, and a natural picture will be better accompanied by human power.</p>

<p>— Shi Jimei</p>
<p>A person without faith is a wanderer in thought, homeless.</p>
<p>Eternal smiles are made of eternal patience.</p>
<p>Only the things that are never obtained will not be lost.</p>
<p>Even if a robber lives next door, it is not necessarily terrible; what is terrible is that there is a small thief in the house.</p>
<h3 id="e142">Universality of Art <a href="#e142" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c142" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">142</a></h3>
<p>— Zhao Jingshen</p>
<p>The various branches of art, such as literature, painting, calligraphy, sculpture, music, drama, etc., each have their universality, so it is often the case that one person can excel in several kinds of art. Recently, I saw the art exhibitions of three painters, and I felt that this statement was correct.</p>
<p>Yu Yang's Wang Shuxi came all the way from Bengbu to Shanghai to hold an art exhibition. He is not only good at painting and calligraphy, but I can see that he is also very accomplished in literature. Therefore, he writes the characters of Wang Xizhi's "Preface to the Orchid Pavilion Collection" the most, and also Fan Zhongyan's "Yueyang Tower Record," Ouyang Xiu's "Drunken Pavilion Record," Du Fu's poems, etc. His paintings include Yuanming appreciating chrysanthemums and Fang Weng's fan. Because he is accomplished in literature and art, his paintings are different from the ordinary, and have the style of "literati painting."</p>
<p>Hai Ning's Qian Junsong is even more needless to say. More than ten years ago, I said this in "Literati Silhouettes": "He understands music, has compiled song collections and operas, and is also a master of cover design, and can also carve stone seals. Occasionally, when he is in the mood, he will write you a letter with a full page of seal characters." This shows that his carving and writing are not something he has done for a day or two. Recently, I also saw his paintings. I like him the most because he can create his own composition and break the tradition. When others paint peony paintings for the middle of a hall, they always leave some "sky space," but he just comes up with a full page; otherwise, he will come up with a pine tree, and specially leave half of the writing space or sky space on it. The "Old Man's Lonely Tree" is also quite unique.</p>
<p>Wu County's Fan Boyan is the son of Shaoyun, with a deep family background, and has seen many famous paintings. He is also a versatile person. He sings old men in Kunqu Opera, and his voice and strength are very abundant. He can also play large sets of pipa. Now I have also seen his Chinese paintings, and landscapes are the best. I most appreciate and love his "Holding a Cup to Enjoy the Moon," "Evening Mooring on a Misty River," "Pine Spring," and "Pine Creek Egret," which I think are very spiritual and have a artistic conception. I don't know why, but I especially like his pine trees.</p>
<p>I am a layman to painting, and all that I have said above can be regarded as the impression of a literary person who does not understand painting.</p>
<p>###</p>
<p>In March, after reading the book "Slow Records of the Master of Yi Garden," the publisher did not specify who "Yi Garden" was, so I made a special study and found that it was the work of Chen Chong (Liuzhou) of Yizheng, published in this edition. A letter was received by airmail from Mr. Zhao Shixian a few days ago, which was very gratifying, and he also transcribed a letter from Chen to Weng Tonghe, which I also found very interesting. However, the two letters were written to my younger brother, Yishi, and it seems that he mistakenly thought that my brothers were one person. It is said that in the years before the incident, the Tianjin Guowen Weekly had a "Lingxiao Yishi Notes" that was often published, and the editor printed the two pen names in a straight line, and "Lingxiao Yishi" looked like a signature, so that those who read the article "Lingxiao Hange" elsewhere mistakenly thought it was Yishi, and the two letters were mistakenly sent, and there were many twists and turns, and it was still necessary to declare at any time. Thank you for copying the letter from Chen to Weng, the top line calls "Senior Uncle Ping Gongbao," and the content is quite simple. At that time, Weng was no longer in a key position, and it was only a private greeting. First of all, condolences were offered for the death of Weng Zengyuan, which is what the letter said: "The matter of Brother Zhongyuan is truly amazing." Zengyuan's name was Zhongyuan, and he was Tonghe's nephew. He was the top scholar in the Guihai year of Tongzhi two years, and he was a junior to Chen. Chen was the messenger of the previous Renchen year, so he only called Zengyuan "Brother Zhongyuan" and called Tonghe "Senior," because he was Bingchen in Xianfeng, three years earlier than Chen. Suzhou is famous for its many top scholars. According to statistics, in the three hundred years of the former Qing Dynasty, Jiangsu Province ranked first in the country in terms of the number of top scholars, and Suzhou Prefecture ranked first in the entire province. In the thirteen years of the Tongzhi Dynasty, there were six examinations in total, and the Jiangsu scholars ranked first in four, and Suzhou ranked first in three of the four, namely Changshu Weng Zengyuan (Guihai), Wu County Hong Jun (Wuchen), and Yuanhe Lu Runxiang (Jiasu). The remaining three were Xu Fu (Rensu) of Jiading, Jiangsu, Chong Qi (Yichou, father of the Tongzhi Queen), and Liang Yaoshu of Guangdong.</p>
<p>The prosperity of the Weng family of Changshu is comparable to that of the Pan family of Wu County, both of which are outstanding in Suzhou. Weng Tongsu, whose courtesy name was Shuping, later named himself the Old Man of Song Zen and the Old Man of Ping, was the youngest son of the great scholar Weng Xincun, whose posthumous title was Weng Wenzhong. Xincun was a scholar in the Dao Guang Renwu year, the same year as Chen Chong's father, Jiashu. His sons Tongsheng and Tonghe were also scholars, and Tongsheng and his nephew Zengyuan (i.e., the son of Tongsheng) were also top scholars. However, after Zengyuan won the top prize, he was dismissed from his hometown due to illness, and lived in the forest for more than ten years and died, making him the most unfortunate of the top scholars. He did not actually pass the provincial or metropolitan examination, but was granted the honor due to his grandfather and father, and he became famous in the palace examination and won the top prize. He passed away in Dihai, and the old man Yu Yue of Quyu wrote a eulogy couplet: "Three autumn cassia, three spring apricots, all bestowed from heaven, only occupying the top of the golden turtle;"; "Grandson of Wenzhong, son of Wenqin, what is the meaning of returning to lie in the mountains, and finally resigning from the Green Field Hall." The Pan family of Wu County included Pan Shien (the top scholar of the Qianlong Guichou year), Pan Shihuang (the third place scholar of the Qianlong Yimao year), and Pan Zuyin (the third place scholar of the Xianfeng Renzi year). In addition, there were many scholars and scholars, which do not need to be recorded in detail. Zuyin's style name was Boyin, and his hao was Zhengqi. His provincial examination was also bestowed by grace. He ranked third in the Renzi examination, two years earlier than Weng Tonghe, and was a senior scholar. In the early years of the Qing Dynasty, the two were officials of the first rank, and they were both leading figures in the literary world of the capital, and the literary world called them "Weng Pan"; my brother Yishi often said that they should be called "Pan Weng", and Weng should not be added to Pan's name. I said that the title "Pan Weng" sounds like the name of one person, which is easily misunderstood.</p>
<p>The prosperity of Suzhou's top scholars reached its peak in the Tongzhi period, and prosperity declined. There were thirteen examinations in the Guangxu Dynasty, but there was not a single Suzhou scholar. (There were two top scholars in Jiangsu Province, namely Huang Siyong of Jianning in the Gengchen year, whose style name was Shenzhi, and Zhang Jian of Nantong Prefecture in the Jiawu year, whose courtesy name was Jizhen, neither of whom were from Suzhou.) Lu Runxiang of the Jiasu year was the last of the Suzhou scholars. Lu served as the emperor's teacher with the appearance of a top scholar, and died in the fourth year of the Republic of China. His student Wang Yitang mourned him and said, "The peaches and plums of the public's gate fill the world," "The mourning of the teacher is better than the winning of the imperial court." Yitang is not worth mentioning, and his writing is also mediocre, but this couplet is not bad.</p>
