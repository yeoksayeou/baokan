<p>國大代表十八日開始報到。由於國務會議核定這次大會爲第一屆（上次大會爲制憲國大），可見這次大會的重要性。行憲雖自去年十二月廿五日開始，到現在已三個月，可是行憲國大的集會，這還眞是第一次。</p>
<p>國大報到處設在國民火會堂的右側，那是一棟新建的房屋。大會幾組的辦公處擠在一排小房了裏，却留了一個很大的大廳作爲休息至，這休息室，在人會開幕之前，便是報到處。報到處中井井有條，牆壁和支柱上面都貼滿指示的標幟：那裏簽名，那裏塡表，那裏領取旅費和文件，那裏可以休息。</p>
<p>如果你是一位國大代表，當你走進報到處後，迎面便是簽名　。你必須拿出你的當選證書，然後在簽名簿上留下你的名字，再領取報到表和住宿單。塡住宿單的時候，別忘記你應該</p>
<p>說明你準備住在何處—是自有佳所，還是住招待所和特約旅館。文件塡好，連同自己的二寸半身照片四張，到對面的櫃台上交件，領取一個銅牌，就像到銀行取款一樣的銅牌。噢，這是應該補敍一筆：如果你沒有照片，或忘記帶來呢？籌備會已經爲你準備好，當時即可拍照，用攝影室的憑證代替照片，送到交件處。那麼，你可以到報到處的最裏面，那裏是休息室，可以隨便用些茶點。等到發件處按照銅牌高唱號碼時，你便可以到那裏取來一個文件袋。文件袋中包括着如下的雜物：</p>
<p>（一）代表證章一枚，（二）代表乎册一本，（三）報到代表在京通訊錄一本，（四）當選證書收據一紙，（五）代表變更在京通訊住地郵片二張，（六）代表住宿證或介紹旅館通知單一紙，（七）代表支款憑證一紙，（八）大會交通管理規則一份，（九）大會交通車乘坐規則一份，（下）大會代表車輛調查表一份，（十一）大會回程或大會期間旅行各地委托購票通知書一份。</p>
<p>憑着「代表支款憑證」，你可以走回來，在付款處領取款項，祗消在印妥的收據上簽名蓋章，便領到膳費三百六十萬元，宿費四百五十萬元（公費五百萬元，要到大會開幕後一週內再發）。如果你想接洽交通工具，那兒交通接洽處的職員正在等候你；如果你有委辦或問詢的事，問訊處或服務處不也正恭候大駕嗎？這樣，　的報到手續便完成了。如果不擁擠，自始至終，祗需要四分鐘。，</p>
<p>正當九十餘位職員靜候代袋大駕的時候，第一位代表前來報到了，那是江蘇省句容縣區域代表丁寶孝。中電的攝影師和一些攝影記者，準備已久，他們想攝取報到第一人的簽頭，於是丁代表，便成了「開末　」的對像。爲了拍電影，他被「導演」着姿勢，把驗證，簽名，領表，塡表，交件，取件，取款，一一攝入，時間不免躭擱了一些。這時，第二位報到代表也到了。這位是砲兵出身的金鎭，前瀋陽市長，現在以全國性邊疆民族滿民代表身份參加國大，沒有人再給他拍電影，於是他的手續辦得很快，他領到了文件袋，獲得第一號證章。等那位丁代表滿面春風拍完電影時，纔發覺第一號證章巳被金先生領取。這時不免引起一點小交涉，他是報到第一人，應該領第一號證章，但砲兵中將（金鎭）說得好：　「你已經上鏡頭了，第一號證章便留給我吧」。</p>
<p>代表們零零落落的來，人數不多，大會職員閒得無事作，有些職員在休息處用茶點。茶點是中央飯店孔雀餐廳包辦的，代表們可以隨意取用，不必付費。</p>
<p>來了幾位代表，沒有當選證書，詢問之下，不能報到，祗好走了，等待拿到當選證書時再來。一個上午，報到的代表祗有七位，職員們大呌：「生意淸淡」。報到的時間是上午八時半到十二時，下午二時至六時，下午報到的人比較多些，但這一天的總數，也不過是十七人。據說是因爲有許多人不知道報報是今天開始的，也有許多人還沒有領到當選證書。佔計這次開會的代表二千七百餘人，大多數在開幕的前幾天同時來報到，將來會有一塲緊張忙亂。</p>
<p>負責籌備大會的孫科，莫德憲，徐傳霖，劉東岩，和秘書長洪蘭友，在上午九時半到報到處參觀，除了洪蘭友之外，恰好是國民黨，民社黨，靑年黨，社會賢達各一人，攝影記者搶着爲他們拍了照。孫科等繞塲一週，看看各種佈置和職員們辦事的情形，都一再點頭，表示滿意。</p>
<p>代表報到的工作便這麼開始了。這工作將一直延續到大會開幕之時，許多人在問：「蔣主席那一天來報到？」（三月十八日自南京寄）</p>

<h3 id="c29">杜魯門總統兩次演說以後 <a href="#c29" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e29" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">29</a></h3>
<p>美國杜魯門總統前天在參衆兩院聯席會議的演說，無疑的是世界第二次大戰結束以後最具有重要性的歷史文件·今後我們就得看美國人和全世界愛好民主和平的國家對杜魯門總統演詞的反應如何了。</p>
<p>近半月來，歐洲局勢急轉直下，幾巳到了「冷戰」的最後階段，使站在大西洋彼岸的美國總紙杜魯門也不得小表示其對於世界和平的信心開始動搖了。但是第二次大戰後的美國，對於世界和平的維持，在道義上，在歷史上均負有特殊責任，其一言一動均爲世界的安危所繫。所以全世界的人民，尤其是戚受共產勢力威脅的入民，無不引領以望華府的動靜。同時在杜魯門總統本人，深知目前世界的危急與美國責任的重大，也亟欲喚起美國朝野的警覺，故在幾天以前，就決定向參衆兩院聯席會議發表演說，闡明世界大勢，並要求國會採取必要步驟，以挽狂瀾於未倒。這一篇外交演說，不僅爲美國　野所重視，抑且爲世界各國人民所注意；在杜魯門總統發表演說前的一剎那之間，全世界的人民，大概都在屏息靜聽杜稱門總統的怒吼。</p>
<p>現在，我們終於從廣播中聽到了杜魯門總統的演說，同時在電報中讀到了這篇重要演詞的全文‘。綜合演詞的要點如次：（一）民主之生存已感受威脅，全世界的自由男女英勇對付其自由所遭遇之威脅，此其時矣。（二）美國必须保持强大的實力，支援歐洲現仍自由而有感受共產威脅及警察國家統治之虞之各國。（三）吾人必須準備償付和平之代價，否則吾人勢必償付戰爭之代價。（四）呼籲暫時恢復徵兵制及實行普遍軍事訓練，以應付爲蘇聯不斷侵略所造成之嚴重局勢。（五）要求國會對於五十三億歐洲復與計劃迅速行動。（六）吾人在危急之秋力能　員大批訓練有素之軍隊，即能阻止未來衝突的發牛，再採取其他國策，郎能恢復世界的穩定。（七）買行普遍軍訓足以向世界宣示吾人爲和平後盾，不特有絕大決心，且具有　致和平之力量。（八）吾人應不分分黨派，組織聯合陣綫，並聯合世界各國，作一切可能之努力，以保持世界和平。</p>
<p>杜魯門總統這一席話，乃由總統本人與政治外交軍事經濟專家會商擬定的，句句有作用，字字有分量，惟因演說的時間僅有二十分鐘，不及加以詳細的闡明。但杜魯門總統出席國會聯席會議之後，立即飛往紐約，出席聖彼特利克晚餐會演說，更加率直的抨擊蘇聯企圖在西歐現仍自由的各國內樹立集權統治，並指出共產主義否認上帝，不承認人類有自治之權利，實爲一種暴政。他又說目前民主之存在已受共產主義之威脅，美國已成爲自由世界唯一的保護者，此時應以吾人之力量聯合其他自由人民之力量，與共產主義鬥爭，以故吾人應以軍事的經濟的道德的力量爲此等國　之奧援。前後兩篇演說的內容雖然不同，但在我們聽來，後者又比前者更加有力，更加坦白。惟杜魯門總統若祗在口頭上怒吼，譴責蘇聯的侵略，抨擊共產主義的威脅自由，而美國仍不能立即在各方面採取有效的行動，以阻攔共產勢力的洪流泛濫，則能否立即挽回世界的狂瀾，我們還不能無疑。</p>
<p>放眼看看最近半月來的歐洲，局勢正在結晶化。一方面，先有捷克政變的發生，自捷共攫得政權後，民主的悲劇已接述演出；後有蘇聯的迫令芬蘭締結互助條約，目前雖然還在談判的階段，但芬蘭爲大勢所迫，恐怕將祗有唯命是從。最近歐洲各處又充滿了驚人的謠言，不是說蘇聯對於土耳其將有所行　，就是說蘇聯將要求挪威瑞典北歐諸國簽訂盟約，義大利普選在即，共產黨的活躍，更是駭人聽聞。而在另一方面，外交上的活動也相當的熱閙。倫敦會　決定西德三國佔領區實行合併，比京五國會也已將西歐五國盟約起草完成，昨且已在巴黎簽字成立，更有擴大的可能。此外，歐洲十六國會議也有巴黎　行，不論從各國代表的態度看來，或以會議的經過情形而論，都足以表現出西歐各國精誠團結，共同一致，對付共產主義的威脅。美國雖未直接參加，但是美國實際上是民主自由國家的「護法」，是不可否認的事實。看了杜魯門總統的演說，格外可以相信，美國的援歐政策，也將從經濟援助逐漸演變而爲軍事援助了。由此看來，除了西歐各國自身的團結而外，再加上美國的全力援助，論理歐局可望漸趨澄淸的。但是，爲什麼杜魯門總統的演說還未能安定天下的人心呢？我們認爲至少有二個理由；</p>
<p>第一，今日的歐洲兩極化之後，以視一九三八年慕尼黑會議後的局勢，尤爲嚴重。過去的侵略者是納粹德國，當時希特勒雖擁有奧國及捷克的一部分，但是東歐九國者和英法有同盟的關係。加以法國在當時是歐洲陸軍最强大的國家，而在更東，還有一個第三種勢力—蘇聯，在那裏牽制着。回首看看今日的歐洲，因爲極權共產主義國家事事猛着先鞭，民主國家處處落後，故不論從人口成面積而言，這兩大集團幾已到了勢均力敵不相上下的地步。而况從地理地位或軍略形勢而論，東歐集團尚佔優勢，似非西歐集團所能及·所以西歐聯盟至今日成立，其意義雖然重要，西歐五國不特要互助合作以制止蘇聯的軍事侵略，而且還要一心一德共同防範國內第五縱隊的活動。惟按之官際，其作用恐並沒有像世人所想像的那麼偉大，而且展望其前程，荊棘滿途，未必一帆風順，實在不容過分樂觀。</p>
<p>第二，杜魯門總統雖已坦白表示其反共的立塲。並率直宣佈其支持民主自由國家的態度。但其所指，依然偏重在歐洲方面。尤其是馬歇爾將軍還在固執他「歐重於亞」的成見，公開表示不願在兩綫作「冷戰」，好像亞洲中國方面不值得重視一般。這就是有很大的危機潛伏着。本報社論會」再指出共產主義的國　性，並無輕重可分。蘇聯刻正在歐洲及亞洲同時擴張其勢力，美國當局若只知其一而不知其二，僅知歐洲的危急，而不知亞洲局勢的嚴重，那末美國不論其採取何種步驟，未必即足以阻遏共產勢力擴張。須知中國如一旦落於共產　權者之手，以整個赤化的中國，爲共產陣營作支持，則全亞洲的地圖均將變色，太平洋彼岸的美國也未必能够安枕。所以杜魯門總統的兩次演說，均未提及站在反共最前綫的中國，我們實在不能不表示扼腕。願再正告美國朝野，先歐後亞的政策，誠將招致不可挽回的災禍，如不從速改絃易轍，勢必重蹈覆轍，鑄成歷史上的大錯！</p>

<p>〔中央社東京十八日電〕我駐日賠償歸還委會主席吳半晨告記者稱：遠東委會現正研討我國所　採取「寬大」之歸還政策，以利歸還工作之建議。吳氏認爲；歸還工作進行遲緩之主因，爲遠東委會之各種限制，委會過於重視證據，我國委會對於大批證據不足之損失，無法提出要求，例如戰時日本自我國掠得糜托車二百輛，然因缺乏證據，我國今僅可要求歸還四輛，證件不足或缺少之情形，並不足奇，因可作證據之文件，於戰爭期間損失一部或全部者，初非異事。歸還工作之第二障碍，爲委員會及日政府間不能直接接觸，否則委會可對被掠物品獲得更多綫索。過去一年來，委會盡力工作，然因上述原因，所獲結果較預期者相距遠甚。委會過去之收穫如下：我國規模最大製造硝酸之永利化學公司全部設備一千五百容積噸，前自南京選至日本，最近即可由駛日之海鄂輪運返。又日本自我國寺院掠來若干鐵像，鐵鐘，亦將由該輪運返我國。廣州紙廠原亦爲日本全部移至北海道，最近即可卸拆歸還。天津三夾板公司及上海派克大維　廠機器亦將歸還，後者日後並轉交美國方面。委會日前進行交涉歸選曾養甫所主辦計劃製造汽車之華南鋼鐵公司之一部機器，閻錫山主辦之西北實業公司機器，運日者達三千件，目前已發現一千件，即將運返。其他歸還之物品，爲船四艘，摩托車四輪，珍本書篇三萬五千册，普通書籍九萬五千册等。又其他軍艦兩艘，，最近亦可歸還我國。</p>

<p>— 本報記者　袁文中</p>
<p>一九四八年一月四日，靑天白星滿地紅旗在緬甸大地上冉冉升起。擁有二十六萬餘方里土地與一千四百餘萬人口的緬甸聯邦，從此擺脫大英帝國六十一年的統治，開始她獨立自主的新生命。</p>
<p>獨立盛典</p>
<p>三月十一日印督蒙巴頓夫婦從加爾加答飛到仰光，十二日主持交還緬王寶座典禮，完成了緬甸獨立的最後儀式。記者團乘中航公司中緬航綫首次通航機赴緬觀光，適逢其會，得參與這緬甸歷史上最珍貴最興奮的一幕。緬王寶座係一八七五年鐵霸王在瓦城所建，高有三十英呎十英吋，鍍金色，形狀頗似我國的牌樓，後部有梯級可上。一八八五年英人攻下瓦城，緬王被流放至孟買。一九〇二年英寇松勛爵將寶座拆卸，裝成三十六箱，運至印度，陳列於印度博物院中，以迄於今。緬甸既獨立，寶座乃於二月六日從印度分裝六十節運回仰光，重新裝置於昔爲總督衙門現爲總統府的大廳之中。蒙巴頓主持的典禮，就在這廳市中舉行。那一天，各國使節來賓與緬甸委員參加的有好幾百人。典禮儀式非常節單，僅僅由蒙巴頓與緬甸總統各自穴讀一篇動聽的演詞，賓座前遮掩的幃幕由蒙巴頓解開，同時奏起緬甸國歌，緬甸獨立的形式就此功德圓滿了。蒙巴頓雖然還是那麼英俊，但在整個儀式中，似乎帶着疲乏與漠然的神態。這一位替大英帝國執行摘除皇冠上一顆寶石的勳爵，他的心情如何是不難於使人瞭解的。</p>
<p>英握王牌</p>
<p>這樣，英國在緬甸正式退出了政治舞台，然而在軍事與經濟上她還是緊握着不敗的王牌。一九四七年八月廿九日英緬簽訂的防禦協定，除了訂定英國軍隊儘連撤退以及一切軍事設備轉讓與緬甸政府之外，雙方協議，由英國派遣海陸空軍顧間團担任訓練緬甸軍隊的工作，緬甸政府除英國之外，不得接受其他國家的軍事顧問。「雙方的」海軍船隻得在通知之下，進人對方的國境，「雙方的」空軍飛機得在通知之下，飛臨對方的國境。「雙方的」陸軍在必要時，亦得開進對方的國境。這一份協定有效期暫定爲三年，換句話說，英國的軍事勢力在緬甸至少還可以控制三年的時間。在經濟上緬甸最大的工商業依舊紫握在英國人手裏，幾家大公司如緬甸油公司，如內河航業公司，如實珍洋行，控制住緬甸的工業，航業與商業，以其勢力的根深蒂固，決非短時間內所能動擋。</p>
<p>政府份子</p>
<p>雖然如此，緬甸總算是獨立了。緬甸現政府號稱是反法西斯蒂的左傾政府，最初是由社會黨，國民志願軍與共產黨三個政黨所組成，名稱爲人民自由同盟，但在登台以後，共黨　因政綱不合，即行退出，並分裂爲紅旗共產黨與白旗共產黨，紅旗是最左的激烈黨派，現已被政府宣佈爲非法的政黨，白旗雖比較溫和，但亦拒絕與政府合作。除此之外，右派的反對黨有德欽黨，愛國黨與平民黨。去年轟動世界的緬甸大政變，自由同盟主席翁山爲愛國黨領袖島梭謀刺斃命，島梭方於最近被法院判處死刑。政府的內閣總理泰金諾，乃是自由同盟副主席，掌握着實際的大權。</p>
<p>闡明政策</p>
<p>關於現政府的政策，泰金諾在制憲大會中闡述得很爲詳細。他說：「緬甸爲什麼要向左走？因爲緬甸的財富完全集中在第一英國，第二印度，第三中國的資本家手裏，緬甸平民大衆生活在最下層的窮困貧乏之中，啃着別人剩下來的骨頭。這一種不公平的情形必須加以掃除，但其意義並非是造成少數的緬甸資本家來代替英·印·中國的資本家，而大多數人民依舊貧窮痛苦，所以政府的政策是要建立一種爲全體人民謀福利的制度，使全體人民均亨其益·這種政策並不是急進的，並不是一朝一夕所能成功的，這種政策亦並非完全蘇聯式的，因爲緬甸的地理環境並不像捷克·保加利亞那樣與蘇聯接近，今日緬甸政府的第一重要任務是竭力使國家强盛，唯有國家愈强盛，我們才能愈向前進！」</p>
<p>經濟現狀</p>
<p>的確，直至目前爲止，緬甸的財富完全在英國人，印度人與中國人手裏。英國人遙遙在上，印度人與華僑握住中下層的工商業，在仰光市區內簡直完全是英國人印度人與華僑的世界，難得看到緬甸人開設的舖子。緬甸政府現在竭力向國家經濟主義的路上走，它公佈不動產法案，禁止緬境不動產向外人出售或抵押，但，這除了使華僑蒙受影嚮之外，英印僑民仍可例外。它又統制進出口貿易，規定限額中百分之五十給緬甸商人，但因緬商本身無此能力，於是或將熱照轉讓，或與外人合作，結果仍舊爲外商所得。它又想將工礦業收歸國營，但因財政困細，無力支付收購的代價，所以在最近的將來恐怕還不能實現·（下文轉入第五版）</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕紐約十八日廣播：華盛頓訊，國防部長福萊斯特與陸長羅雅爾本日出席參院武裝部隊委員會陳述意見，主張增加目前規定之軍事力量，對杜魯門總統所報實施普逼軍訓與暫時恢復　兵之建議，力予支持。陳氏謂目前規定之軍事實力，係根據兩年前所作之假定，惟未能實現。　並未提出確切之數字，惟謂肯定之建議須於詳細研究之後始能提出。福氏稱，陸軍之規定實方為六十六萬九千人，月下僅有五十六萬人；海軍之規定實力爲六十六萬四千人，且下僅有四十七萬四千人在服務中；空軍之規定實力爲四十七萬一千人，而目下僅有卅六萬二千人。此等數字，顯示目下之缺額爲四十萬〇八千人。惟福氏先前所估計之缺額爲卅五萬人。國會共和黨領袖對普遍軍訓依然冷淡，但對於實行新徵兵不致過份反對。福氏力言吾人切不可存內原子彈之存在而以爲大量人員已不再需要之觀念。</p>
<p>〔美國新聞處華盛頓十七日電〕編杜魯門總統本日請求國會重立徵兵制與制定普遍軍訓以後，國務卿馬歇爾發表聲明，敦促國會採取決定行動，以示「美國決意保特强大之實力，以維特歐洲世界之和平與自由」。馬卿此項聲明，係向參院軍事委員會所發表。該委會本日開始公開總政關於普遍軍訓問題及關於總統請求恢復徵兵制提高全國武裝部隊至適當實力之意見。普遍軍訓議案已在衆院軍事委會順利報吿，但衆院規程委會尙未將本案在會議席上提出。</p>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓十七日電〕國務卿馬歇爾今日在參院軍事委員會發表意見稱，若無兵力，則在目前世界大局中之外交行動唯有趨於遷就。委員會應討論全國靑年軍訓法及臨時徵兵法，美國空軍擴充程序亦有考慮必要。馬氏謂臨時徵兵法乃使軍隊迅速十補足實額之唯一辦法。以朝鮮而論，駐軍司令曾請增兵至三萬八千名，但陸軍部僅派三萬名，且因員額不足，甚至三萬名之數亦未能派足。本年二月八日，朝鮮駐軍共有一萬八千名，最近報吿僅有一萬五千名，此種駐軍且仍在縮减中。馬氏並謂，本月十八日義大利選舉，其重要性遠過於該國局部事件，此舉不僅將決定義大利是否能恢復眞正民主，並將預示分裂之趨勢，此種趨勢或將擴展至大西洋之濱</p>

<p>〔路透社倫教十七日電〕此間外交界人士感覺杜魯門總統之籲請國會恢復徵兵制度，實行普遍軍訓，及迅速通過援歐法案，實寓有予五國西歐聯盟公約以軍事保證之意。世界反共陣綫之鞏固，在過去廿四小時中已完成空前的成就，歐洲十六國昨在巴黎議定設立經濟合作永久性機構之後，今日復在比京成立英法荷比慮之軍事互助公約，九十分鐘後杜魯門總統復在華盛頓率直表示特予西歐國家以任何所需要的軍事援助，此一連串的重大行動發生在短短的廿四小時之內，實爲歷史上所罕有。</p>
<p>〔路透社巴黎十七日電〕杜魯一門總統向國會發表的演說使法官方及民衆產生深刻重大的印象，一般雖料到杜魯門將有强力的聲一明，但未料到杜魯門竟提出如此其體的建議，及對蘇聯如此毫無顧忌的警吿。此間並認杜魯門之一支持西歐五國公約，不啻聲明於一發生五國公約內所述及的環境而五國從事自衛時，美國將參加五國實行軍事干涉。美總統之特別着重於肯定而積極的行動，而不僅對蘇聯作口頭上的恐嚇，尤使此間負責人士表示歡迎。</p>

<p>〔聯合社華盛頓十七日電〕朝鮮南部美軍佔領區已定於五月九日舉行選舉，此乃美國努力促進朝鮮獨立加強遠東民主之又一步。頃據美國外交界某要人稱，「吾人並不幻想此舉將解決朝鮮當前之種種問題，未來之投票爲試驗性質，與吾人想像之普遍選舉，相差尙遠」。未來朝鮮政府將設總統，總理，內閣及其他官職，均將由議會選出。此間預料朝鮮右派領袖李承曉將出任議長。聞李氏亟欲任朝鮮共和國總統，但北鮮倘不參加，則共和國政府前途仍難明朗。</p>

<h3 id="c70">杜魯門演詞全文 <a href="#c70" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e70" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">70</a></h3>
<p>〔美國新聞處華盛頓十七日電〕杜魯門演說全文如下：「我今天在此向諸位報吿歐洲局勢的嚴重性，並建議行動以供諸位考慮：歐洲正在經歷迅速的變化，這些變化將影響我們的外交政策和我們的國家安全。對於那些努力保持一種給予人民以自由的政府形式的國家，現在有着一個日見增加的威脅。美國深切地關注這些國家自由的保存。爲了保持那種我們可以據以達成基於自由與公道的永久和平的情况，我們必需於現在採取行動。這種和平的達成，一直就是我國的偉大目標。</p>
<p>自從戰爭中最大的一次戰爭結束以來，差不多已經度過了三年，可是和平與安定並沒有重新回到世界。我們深知戰爭結束，並不能自動解決由於戰爭所引起的問題。戰爭結束後建樹和平，一直是個艱難的工作。即使第二次世界大戰中所有的盟國都有共同的願望來建設一個公正而光榮的和平，在達到這個目標的道路上，也仍然有着巨大的困難。</p>
<p>但是今天的世界局勢，主要並非是由於戰爭發生以後，天然的困難所造成的結果。它主要是由於一個國家，不僅拒絕在建立公正及光榮的和平中合作，而且—更壞的是—一直積極努力阻止。</p>
<p>對於時局的進展，國會是很稔熟的。</p>
<p>你們知道民主國家曾誠摯地和忍耐地企圖經由談判與協議，從事覓得和平的穩固基礎·會議在世界不同的部份一次又一次的舉行。在可能容許建立公允和平的基礎上，我們曾經試行解決由戰爭而造成的問題。你們知道我們所已遭遇到的困難，但是已往的記錄彷彿像一個紀念碑一樣的，縱然直立，證明世界民主國家的忠貞不阿·我們所已獲到的協議，雖然未能盡善盡美，但已可替公允的和平提供基礎—祗要這些協議已被遵守。</p>
<p>可是協議未被遵守。</p>
<p>這些協議一再爲一個國家所藐視與破壞。</p>
<p>國會對於聯合國的發展，也很稔熟。世界大多數國家，已在聯合國內聯合一起，努力建立基於法律而不是武力的世界秩序。大多數國家熱烈與誠摯的支持聯合國，並力促其更為堅強與有效。</p>
<p>但是有一個國家已經時常濫用否決權而一再阻撓聯合國的工作。在兩年另一些時候的期內，此一國家已經否決了將被採取行動的建議二十一項。</p>
<p>但是這還不够，自從戰爭結束以來，蘇聯及其代理人已摧毀了東歐和中歐一連串國家的獨立和民主的性格。</p>
<p>造成了今日歐洲危急的局勢的，也正是這種殘忍的行動，和顯然企圖使這種行動擴展到歐洲其餘自由國家的計謀。</p>
<p>捷克共和國的淪亡，使整個文明世界受到震驚。現在正以壓力加諸芬蘭，使　個斯千的那維亞半島岌岌不安。希臘處於叛徒的直接軍事雙擊之下，這些叛徒受到共黨所控制的隣國的積極支持。在議在利，共產主義少數黨不顧一切，國圖控制這個國家。所用的方法雖各不同，但其式樣，都很顯明</p>
<p>在這稱與日俱增的威脅之下，現在已有令人興奮的徵象，那就是歐洲各自由國家爲了他們的經濟福利和自由的共同保衛而更加團結一致。</p>
<p>在經濟方面，互相自助的行動，正在進行中，藉以恢復保存自由制度所必需的情形。在巴黎，在歐洲復興計劃中合作的十六國現正再度會議，設立　一個聯合機構，爲西歐的經濟復原而工作。</p>
<p>美國堅決支持這些國家爲修理戰爭所造成的破壞以及恢復健全的世界經濟所作的努力。我在去年十二月間向國會提出此一計劃時，曾力言迅速行動的必要。自從那一天以來，歐洲方面的每一樁事情都明白指出：速採取此等步驟的極大迫切性。</p>
<p>蘇聯及其衛星國家被邀參加歐洲復興計劃從事合作。它們拒絕了這個邀請。抑有進者，它們宣佈了它們對該項計劃的激烈仇視態度，並且以攻擊的姿態企圖予以破壞。它們看出在這個計劃中存在着實現它們制服歐洲自由社會企圖的一個重大障礙。它們甚至不要十六個合作國家實行自助。</p>
<p>歐洲的經濟復興固屬必要，可是單憑經濟重建的措置是不够的。歐洲的自由國家明瞭一點，就是苟欲使經濟復興成功，必須提供若干保護的辦法，藉以抵抗國內和國外的侵略。在它們的自由所遭受的成脅日趨嚴重的情形之下，共同自衛的運動已隨經濟合作的運動而俱來。</p>
<p>就在我向諸位演說的這一刻，歐洲自由社會的五個國家正在布魯塞爾簽訂一個經濟合作和共同防衛侵略的五十年協定。</p>
<p>這個行動是有巨大的重要性的，因爲這個恊定並非是由一個比較强大的鄰人强迫使其接受的。它是代表人民意志的對於獨立政府的選擇，而且是按照聯合國憲章中所規定的條文所從事的。</p>
<p>這重要性，遠勝於協定本身的實際條文。它是歐洲爲了維護和保存它的文明而趨向團結途中的一個重要步驟。這一個發展値得我們來作全力支持。我相信美國將以適當的方法，於局勢需要時，向自由國家擴展他的支持。我相信：歐洲自由國家保護自身的決心，將與我們助其如此做去的同樣決心相配合。</p>
<p>歐洲最近的發展，使我國獲悉許多具有重要性的基本間題。</p>
<p>我相信我們已經到達了這一地步，在這個地步上，美國的立塲必需毫無錯誤地予以說明。</p>
<p>聯合國憲章中的原則和目標，仍舊代表我們對於在國際關係上建立法律的希望。這憲章構成了國際倫理。規律的基本形式，而這個國際倫理正是我國所信服的。但是我們不能够　　於那殘酷的事實，就是由於一個國家的阻撓甚至輕視，這偉大的夢想迄今還不能够完全實現。</p>
<p>所以我門必須另外採取各種措施，以補充充聯合國的工作，並支持它的目標。在世界歷史中，有時候行動　較猶豫爲聰數。行動固然包含若干冒險性，但不行動的冒險性更大。因爲如果我們現在有聰敏的行動，那末我們將加强聯合國和世界各自由國家所代表的自由，正義與和平等力址。</p>
<p>所以我認爲我的責任，應向國會提出建議，這些建議，依我的判斷，最足以支持歐洲一切自由與民主的國家，並改進我們自己國家實力的基礎。</p>
<p>第一，我建議請國會迅速完成其對於歐洲復興計劃的行動。這個計劃是我們援歐政策的基礎這個政策的迅速通過是我們對和平所能提供的最有效的貢獻。</p>
<p>參院不顧政治問題的毅然採取決定的行動，這是民主主義有效工作的顯著例子。</p>
<p>現在時間具有很大的軍要性。我聽到衆院有採取迅速行動的計劃的消息，覺得很是興奮。我希望一天也不浪費。　第二，我建議迅速制定普遍軍訓的立法。</p>
<p>在歐洲自由國家恢復它們的實力之前，以及在共產黨主義盛脅民主政治生存的情形依然存在之時，美國必須保持足够堅强的實力，藉以支持遭受共產黨控制和警察國家統治這種咸脅的歐洲各國。</p>
<p>我相信我們已經懂得維特軍事實力藉以防止戰爭的重要性。我們已經發覺我們苟欲在和平時代保持和平，一個健全的軍事制度係屬必要。已往，侵略者有鑒於我們顯然缺乏電事力量，曾經很不聰明地使戰爭急速發生。雖然他們終因誤解我們的實力而陷於毀滅，可是我們爲了不事準備也已付出了一個可怕的代價。</p>
<p>普遍軍訓是唯一可取的辦法，由此辦法，我們武裝部隊的民間人員就可以建立起來，足以應付緊急事態的要。我們在緊急時期動員大量受有訓練者的能力，可以防止未來的衝突，並且這種能力和國策的其他措置相配合之後，可以恢復世界的穩定。</p>
<p>美國在此時採取普遍軍訓的辦法，可以向全世界明白表示我們以爭取和平的實力來支特爭取和平的意志的決心。我相信美國人民經中國會而獲得採取管遍軍訓的決定，對於鼓勵世界上每一自由政府，至關重要。</p>
<p>第三，我建議暫時重再制定徵兵的立法案，藉以使我們的武裝部隊維持適當的實力。</p>
<p>我們的武裝部隊缺乏維特適當實力所必需的人數。雖然武裝部隊的實力已减低到應付海外議務所必需的最低限度，而遠低於美國大陸上應有的最低限度以下，但我們的武裝部隊，無法以志願入伍的辦法來維特其應有的實力。</p>
<p>除非我們維特我們的武裝部隊，否則我們無法應付我們的國際責任，例如我們必須維特在德國境內的佔領軍，直到歐洲和平安定為止。</p>
<p>正規軍的徵兵需要與後備軍的普遍訓練之間，彼此並無衝突，徵兵是必需的，直至普遇訓練的基礎奠定以後，徵兵才可終止，而正規軍也可維特在志願軍的基礎上面。</p>
<p>我所提出的建議，代表獲取和平與防止戰爭最迫切的步驟。</p>
<p>我們必需準備採取一切聰明與必要的步驟來實現這個偉大的目標。這將需要我們對於其他國家加以援助。這也將需要充足與經過配合的軍事力量。我們必需準備付出和平的代價，否則就可以斷定我們將要支付戰爭的代價。</p>
<p>我門身居美國的人，依然具有決心來以一切可能的方法覓致公正的與光榮的解決國際爭端的基礎。我們將繼續忠於聯合國，並以以其作爲根據法律而非武力的，達成國際安全的主要方法。我們將隨時準備而且熟望和其他國家合作—我重覆一遍，和听有的國家—來以每一個可能的努力達成國際了解</p>
<p>對於蘇聯以及任何其他願意誠心合作來保特和平的國家，這個門戶從未關閉，而且它在將來也不會關閉。</p>
<p>同時，我們不可對於今天全世界所面臨的中心問題感到困惑。</p>
<p>現在巳經到了這樣一個時候，全世界的自由男女，都必然勇敢地面對咸脅他們自由的咸脅。</p>
<p>美國具有重大的責任，從事根據我們的力量爲世界的福利而行動。我們已經知道；我們必須經由眞實的努力而不能憑着幻想去獲得我們所追求的和平，正像我們在戰爭中爭取勝利一樣。　在我們歷史的任何時期中，我們人民的團結，再沒比現在更為重要的了。</p>
<p>為了完全置在我們之前的任務，目標的一致，努力的一致以及精神的一致，都是必要的。</p>
<p>今天在這裏的每一位，都有　一種特殊的責任。世界的局勢是如此的危急，而本國的責任是如此的廣大，決不能客許黨的鬥爭减弱我們維特和平的影響力量。</p>
<p>美國人民有權利可以假定：政治問題不能影響我們的共同工作。他們有權利假定：我們在維護世界和平的努力中，我們將以全力並且毫無遲疑的携手前進。憑着上帝的助力，我們將獲得成功。（完）</p>

<p>又漁管處目前共有漁輪一二七艘，除六十艘出售，其餘百分之十（即十二艘）專作訓練之用外，尙留五十艘作捕魚等用，但因該項船隻均須陸續修理整刷，故經常使用奢僅二十五至三十艘。漁管處對該批漁輪，將來擬根據保管委員會此次大會決議，配合自製半機械木船後組織公司，並將在靑島，溫州，楡林，台灣等處設分公司，但現尙在計劃之中。</p>

<p>〔本報濟南十五日航訊〕共匪集中了魯東南，膠東僅有的筆東野戰軍第九縱隊全　及十三·十四（待證）縱隊各一部，另加四個警備旅，四個獨立團，共約五萬餘人，於本月十日午夜起突向魯中張店，周村，贛川，博山一帶發動鉗形攻勢，企圖遂行其本年二月萊蕪之職戰的故技，圍打硬吃國軍的野戰軍。戰事發展到現在，業已證明歷史絕不會重演，陳毅匪部的這一如意算盤顯已遭受嚴重的失敗。　發動這一個鉗形攻勢的共匪，共分三路：一路以桓臺以東的素鎮為　地攻張店，一路以魯中軍區所在地魯村　　地故潠博，第三路係匪的主力，亦以索鎭爲基地，分股渡孝婦河，竄犯周村·桓台。</p>
<p>張店方面國連連共僅一營，匪以四千餘衆包嚴猛攻，國軍在衆寡懸殊下，苦守至十一日中午，卒因彈盡援絕，全營壯烈犧牲。膠濟鐵路張店辦事處全體員工二千餘人於情况緊急時，立作緊急處置，向西撤退，但當他們行進至馬尙車站附近時，就遇到匪軍的伏擊，直到現在跑回濟南來的尙不促五分之一，所確實知道的是樊培倫工程師已被共匪俘去。</p>
<p>博山方面的國軍因力量過於單薄，為避免被匪「各個擊破」「以大吃小」計，於一聲緊急時，王耀武就命令守軍暨地方團隊當地公敎人員及礦工等全部集中淄川，淄川得此聲援，實力倍增，因之自十一日直打到十四日晨，淄川城反洪山淄博煤礦公司仍始終在國軍之手。　共匪的第三路是攻周村桓台，尤其是周村是他們主要攻擊目標。原因是這「全國第一大村」是國軍某整編師周慶祥部的駐在地，戰爭自十一日進行直到十二日晚，四十八小時中，共匪發砲如雨，前後衝鋒肉搏達六次，損失至少五千餘人，王耀武爲了遂行其戰略目的，避免「被吃」，乃運用其最大的知慧，將全師於十二小時內撤至濟市東卅三公里龍山車站南北之綫，保衛濟南的東關大門。有人認為國軍如此一退百餘里，未免使該區老百姓大遭殃，其實，假使不此之圖，不僅周部可能被「吃光」，並且濟南尤危急，原因是濟南的防衛兵力那時正是想像不到的單薄，這樣旣保全了實力，使共匪「撲了個空」，同時，又穩定了濟南市及其外圍。</p>
<p>當周村戰事發展至最高潮時，近在黃河北岸距濟市不過十餘公里的津浦路桑南車站附近，就吃緊起來，王耀武將軍憑他的最高知慧，最大毅力，終把這最有限的兵力作了最高度的運用。東路的部隊很迅速地靠擺來，南路的部隊亦部份的集中，原來訓練好的民團和義勇警察都充分運用起來，使濟南市在廿四小時內又成爲一個打不開攻不破的鐵壁鋼城。</p>
<p>雖然，由於若干富商大買及綏區高中級官佐眷屬的集體南遷京滬，當使人心一度引起激動，但當他們知道這是王司令官爲了要使他的部下無後顧之憂，更專心致志於保衛濟南保衛山東的本位工作時，大家也就益加鉅靜和安定了。</p>
<h3 id="c110">匪進犯濟南可能性極少 <a href="#c110" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e110" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">110</a></h3>
<p>目下所縈繞在國人心頭的是共匪會不曾接着大規模進攻濟南？對於這一問題，記者個人的答後是可能性甚少。共匪此次進犯周村·張店等地的主要目的凡二：一爲企圖以大吃小，吃我們的周慶祥部。二爲企圖吸引國軍大軍冬集中於濟南附近，然後大舉破壞津浦路浦濟段，尤其是徐浦　，擴大他對蘇北·皖北的擾亂攻勢，甚至威脅到浦口的安全，致傳在首都出席國大的代表先生們聞聞砲聲，嚐嚐虛驚。假使當初共匪即有進窺濟南的企圖，那末在攻周村·張店的同時，至少在魯西南之匪三個縱隊應隨着北上，在大汶口南北地區截斷　浦中段交通，以阻南略國軍的北上增援，然後與東路周村方面匪會犯濟南。共匪不此之圖，益以此次使用兵力過少，因此，這不難帮助我們了解，共匪至少在目下尙無大規模進犯濟市的企圖。</p>
<p>檢討這一次魯　　役，國軍的最大成功是：正規軍未遭受大損失。但相反的，在齊東·桓台·長山·鄒平·周村等地所重建的地方團隊，則並未能充分發揮其應有的威力（本報特派員麗天）</p>

<p>〔本報福州十六日航訊〕關粵兩省亞熱帶境內動植物　殖俱速，肉食類巨獸常易混跡其間，閩省尤以全境多山，山中多野草樹木，歷數百年來，野獸噬人，大虫作祟之說，層出不窮，其中猛虎一項，禍害至大，居民談虎無不變色，每聞「虎患」之來，輒有離鄕背井，將婦孺挈離遠避者。</p>
<p>關於閩省此類肉食獸分佈狀況　據歷年發現并記載，約分四系：首係閩北武夷山系，包括建陽，水吉，崇安，浦城等五六縣，平均每年虎患十餘起，次係閩西永安，大田，尤溪，須昌諸縣，每年虎患約有百起，三係閩南晉江，永春，德化，仙遊諸縣，每年虎患亦有數十起，四係閩東寗德屏南周寗，壽寗，政和諸縣，每年虎患亦達十數起，其中尤以閩西北諸縣爲最常見，每年被噬人畜亦較其他各地佔多，此類猛虎，小則「單身出巡」見有人畜存匿，猛噬以去，大則成羣結隊，施施然來，撻門破戶，遇牲畜小孩一一啣捕，然後呼嘯以去。虎嘯之聲，振憾山岳，聞者喪胆，見者落魄，是故居民皆莫奈他何，有時黑夜沉沉，猛聞虎嘯，轉眼虎至，挨門欲進，率有全家堵門相抗，敲器助威，冀虎驚而返巢者，寖假日久，人民信心盡失，輙目虎爲神物，每聞虎警，日夜焚香　之使去，此中慘况，難以罄書。</p>
<p>閩省西北各縣率皆有獵虎組織，其法仍係挖掘陷聠，裝置機關，誘虎入殼，然後捕而殺之，取骨節脂血爲藥，虎皮製　爲衣，唯邇年以來，以民力無暇及此，兼民槍率皆繳納，故獵虎之舉，已難再見，而一般新式獵戶，亦每難得深人業山邊徼，伺機進擊，故年來虎患且有變本加厲之趨勢。前次閩省參曾開幕日，三四參議　要求警保處訓練所屬打虎，呈請陸大增設打虎課程等笑談，亦即因此而發。</p>
<p>閩省立研究院動植物研究所，去年秋初曾派遣技士楊洋溢，前往順昌採集是項標本，未幾楊氏即以獵得順昌著名巨虎聞。現該虎已運抵福州西湖物產陳列館，供衆展覽。記者日前亦親往參觀，該虎裝置玻樹內，白額吊睛，利牙相向，全身黃白條紋相間，兇狀不一而足，長約六尺，高逾三尺，較之尋常虎略大三分。據該館館長汪盈科稱：該虎呑噬順昌一帶人口，巳無慮百數十人，被噬牲畜尙不計在內。斯患之除，匪時順昌一縣爲之歡騰，即閩北各縣爲虎患而憂者亦皆興舊。其向對民衆「怯虎如神」謬誤觀念之澄淸，尤具良好效果。。（本報記者黃埀慶）</p>

<p>一般地看來，緬甸目前的政局似乎還在風雨飄搖之中，現政府標榜左傾，極力想爲平民謀福利，但在實行時不澈底，有牽肘，結果是兩而都不能討好，共產黨固然暗中活動，以平民黨黨魁伯莫爲首，代表地主階級利益的右傾黨派，亦躍躍欲起，而政府本身社會黨與志願軍亦並不能合作無間。記者團在仰光期間，曾發生幾件大事，由此可以窺見一斑。一是三月十二日紅旗共產黨領袖德欽梭在市區被捕，從他身上搜出的文件中發現紅旗黨有準備在三月二十日暴動以奪取政權的企圖。二是戰後仰光攤販林立，棚屋毘連。政府起先爲討好貧民，不加干涉，但後來經地主階級的攻擊與壓力，又下令拆除市中心某一區的棚屋，因此引起攤販的抗議與請願，共產黨乘機在背後煽動，政府爲此逮捕了好些人纔吿解決。三是緬甸油公司的一千餘工人從九日起開始罷工，排成哩餘長的隊伍在街上遊行喊口號。</p>
<p>罷工事件　直到記者團離開仰光時工潮尙未解決，仰光市上因此汽油絕跡，黑市價格漲到四個羅比一加侖（以美金折合約値國幣四十萬元），而且還是不容易買到。工潮的起因僅是爲了某一個工人因大便時間過長而被監工辭退，實在說來，這種小事不足成爲大工潮的理由，其間顯然另有複雜的內幕。</p>
<p>搗毀報館　另一件事是社會黨徒三月十二日在白塔召開農工大會，會後羣衆將共產黨的「人民呼聲報」「奧文報」及右派的「經濟報」等三家報館搗毀，毆傷了一家報紙的編輯，並拋擲一枚日本式的手溜彈，幸虧沒有爆發。搗毀的原因，是爲三家報紙發表侮辱社會黨領袖之一農林部長德欽陣强姦婦女的消息。內容大概說德欽陳出巡緬北，宿在某人家中，某人之女是部中一司機的妻子，因與丈夫口角而歸寗。德欽陣說可以帶她回仰光與丈夫言歸於好，不料在途中旅館專將那女人强姦了，新聞中且有猥褻叙述。這消息登出的第二天社會黨就在農林部秘書等頓導之下將三家報館搗毀。事情發生後總理泰金諾雖然在廣播中力申維持法律秩序之必要，宣稱將嚴懲暴徒，但由此可以看出政府上層份子尙不能控制下級幹部。在這一連串事件發生以後十四日報上有一段「花邊新聞」刋載政府已頒佈戒嚴令，甚至禁止在市政府附近的鬧區內有五人以上併採式成隊行走。</p>
<p>少數民族　少數民族問題在緬甸亦尙未完全解決，緬甸境內的少數民族有山族（Shans），喀靑族（Kachins），靑族（Ｃhins），吉仁族（Karens，與芒族（Mons）。緬甸人爲求得國內的團結，對於這些少數民族極力拉攏，憲法中規定給予他們充份自治的權利。現任總統沙維坦就是山族的酋長，他雖然並無實際權力，但緬甸人爲討好少數民族可以說已經煞費苦心了。雖然如此，其中吉仁族至今還在要求分治，並且拒絕參加大選，記者團在仰光期間，他們正派了幾位代表來到仰光與政府談判，結果如何尙不能逆料。</p>
<p>戰時損失　緬甸戰時所受損失甚為慘重，仰光市區內被破壞的建築到處可見？離市區不遠佔地四百畝的仰光大學雖然環境幽靜，但內部設備可以說空無所有。大部份校舍墻上都有灰黑色的煙火痕跡，圖書館藏書則已全部燒成灰儘。因爲太窮，所以戰後復興工作還不知道什麼時候才能開始，政府獨立以來，制定了一個農業增產兩年計劃，以求完成一千二百萬畝土地的耕種。本來在戰前緬甸米的輸出。年達三百五十萬噸，戰後不到一百萬噸，他們希望在今年以內增加到一百五十萬噸，除增產之外，政府爲彌補財政收入，祗有在賦稅方面大大加萬，因此物價高漲，平均的生活程度已較戰前漲了三倍。不過大多數緬甸人民的生活水準極低，而緬甸又是產米的國家，所以據他們政府官員的看法，一般人的生活還不致於發生問題。</p>
<p>文化現況　在文化方面，成人百份之九十以上是文盲。仰光緬文英文報紙有二十多家，都不够水準，最大一份報紙的銷路僅有一萬多份。緬甸的新聞記者並不像上海那樣緊張忽忙，他們有一個新聞記者協會，大多數消息據說都是由政府官員移樽就敎的送上門來發表，每星期日並且有一天休息，所以星期一除了一份專在當天出版的「星期一快報」以外，其餘都完全停版。</p>
<p>在對外關係上，緬甸人可以說還沒有濃厚的排外情緒，但是因爲他們剛剛獲得獨立，正如一個初出廬蘆的少年一樣，不免有驕傲自大的幼稚心理，這差不多是大多數仰光的華僑所共同感到的一種印象。　記者團在仰光居留十日，坦白地說來，對於緬甸所得的印象並不怎麼良好，不過這也許是我們對於這一個新近獲得解放的國家期望太奢之故。所以，作爲兄弟之邦，我們仍舊誠懇的祝望這一個初生的嬰兒能够一天天茁壯，强大，慢慢的走上康莊的道路。（完）</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕籃球聯賽甲組已成尾聲，昨晚二塲比賽，出人意外的緊張，靑白後來居上以五十五比五十二勝晨友三分，上半時晨友以卅一比廿三壓倒靑白，靑白在最後一分鐘內，於危險局面中，經徐亨的努力，奪得勝利，可稱昨晚功臣。恩卡斯下半時顯顏色報仇雪恥，結果爲卅五比卅三，僅多二分，上半時十七分平手。仁餘表演極佳，天雨球迷零落。</p>
<p>青白小勝晨友</p>
<p>第一場晨友對靑白，十分鐘內的形勢，似乎晨友微佔着上風，徐亨罰中，靑白才打成十二分均勢，斯後互爭雄長，上落不定，但晨友作風，富進取精神，上半時以卅一比廿三壓倒靑白。</p>
<p>下半時靑白人馬調動，卓國榮張少卿汪均炳易出王南珍周達雲陳祥龍三人，略見起色。在對方增添三分的時候，靑白驟增八分，成卅四—卅一，國榮空門未入，少卿托進，成卅五平手，局面開始轉變，阿亨四隻罰球連中，於是追出了對方。晨友王炳福造成四十一平手，戰局動盪。在最後三分半鐘時，靑白四十八比四十六僅僅領前二分。晨友暫停，後王炳福成了福將，五十一比五十超出，蔡演雄五次犯規，王再罰中一球，達雲替祭，徐亨的二擲一罰，五十五比五十二，在最後一分鐘，反敗爲勝。</p>
<p>恩卡斯勝仁餘</p>
<p>恩卡斯對仁餘，仁餘罰球首先破網。恩却斯瞬息得三分，仁餘居然又以七比三超出。仲已新運均活躍，番軍的幾個大漢，都瞠目不知所措。這樣保持到十五分鐘，格朋乞谷夫鮑萊等猖獗籃下，方見抬頭，十三比十二追出一分，風勢變幻，鮑萊再來一球，上半時十七平手　因雙方釘得緊，同樣缺少獲分的機會，下半時初期，沈鵬舉罰球，成廿二分平手，却利犯規沈二次罰球再建功，乃超過二分。廿四平手時，仲已五次罰出，由李肇和入替，實力銳减。番兵迭有更動，馬漢茀蘭克先後揮入，廿八比廿四，仁餘呼停，未見轉機。馬漢梅開二度，卅二比廿五，孫國政被黜，陳渭沅入替，吳新運凌空中的，姚文彝罰得三元，卅比卅二緊隨不捨，奈時間不待，終塲時仁餘以卅三比卅五，一球之差，敗於番兵，恩卡斯報復首循宿仇。</p>

<p>出口物資貸款問題，有關各方，曾作詳密之研論，業已具體決定。據悉：除出口物資之押匯打包放款，國家行局仍照成例叙做外，並遵照四聯總處最近核定之出口物資定額結匯辦法辦理。此項辦法，相當於抵押放款。如出口商與國外進口商有成交，即可將訂貨證件，向國家行局貸款。貨款額度以出口貨債十分之一之外匯爲限，例如國外進口商之訂貨値一千美金，出口商即可向國家行局獲得一百美金之貸款，照當日中央銀行外匯牌價折合國幣付給。獲得貸款之出口商，在一定限期以內必須出口，期滿後出口商必須向貸款行局，結售出口匯票，以之歸還貸款。此項辦法，較一般抵押貸款，更屬確切有效。加以押匯，及打包放款，出口商即可於產，運，鎖過程中，獲得政府資金之資助。其資金之運用，決不致　匱乏之處。今後出口業在此種情形下，當可好轉。又定額結匯辦法實施後，出口商如不履行結匯條件，貸款行局得收購押品。</p>

<p>四十二支藍鳳細紗，初開即衝出一億九千萬關，喊九千五百萬有人要買，中途再竄上至九千七百萬。嗣因經警人員到塲監視，臨收仍回至初開價一億九千五百萬元。較之上日狂竄一千八百萬元。</p>
<p>四十及卅二支各檔，亦跳上一成强。此外廿一支雙馬現紗及棧單，廿支十六支十支等各紗，一致步升自五六百萬至一千一·二百萬不一。</p>
<p>昨日棉布市塲，情勢異常混亂。紗管曾爲防止布價過份波動，昨決定對棉布交易實行限價，規定每日上漲程度，不得超過前一日收市價百分之五，業已實行，塲內成交數額不多。買賣轉入街頭里衖，其成交數額現明稀暗旺之狀態。</p>
<p>初開時喊價增穩，龍頭細布價在三百七十七八萬盤旋，中途有浮戶了售微降。嗣至十時許，因紡建公司掛牌銀月細布三百五十四萬，較市面約高十萬元配出，且元嗶嘰直貢仍未列入，人心驟吿激昂，買風又起。同時銀根略鬆客帮補進甚衆，浮空亦起吸納，市勢止疲爲堅。更聞原棉供應困難，紗廠减工傳說又盛，人心更形振奮，行情續吿狂竄。十二磅龍頭細布竟超越限價，高至三百八十八萬元有人吃進，塲外再哄至三百九十萬尙乏賣戶，較上日好起十三四萬元及二三十餘萬不一。其餘各布亦均軋升甚多。</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕中國紡建公司昨循例售布，共售布一六九五〇疋，被單三五〇條，申購單五七一張，內除廠商四〇張，購布一九二〇疋外，餘數屬各布號所購。</p>
<p>又訊：昨紡建公司供售之23×23銀月細布，價爲三百五十四萬，申購者甚夥，准購單加五萬至十七萬元，迨至最後，聞紗價飛騰一成强。十二磅龍頭細布，明日期出貨重見四百萬元之高價，五福細布限價三百五十一萬五千元，塲外則做高至三百六十八萬元，尙乏供者，似有再躍之趨勢。</p>

<p>— 梁俊青</p>
<p>近代科學之進步已寖寖乎有轉移造化巧奪天工之勢。姑且不論原子彈之能毀城滅地與夫超音速飛機之一瞬千里，即如以醫學方面而言，其進步之驚人與夫造福人羣之實益則尤非原子彈之類所可比擬於萬一者。蓋新式武器如原子彈之類其殺人之威力雖已震驚世界聞之昨舌，而其爲用則僅限於一地一時，固不如醫藥之能日日用以救人，且能使全世界人類皆能得其實益也。吾今試舉數例言之，當可知近世醫藥在救人方面之偉大。例如肺結核，喉結核以及結核性腦膜炎（即俗稱慢驚風）之類，往昔之患此而死者不知其幾千萬人，且向來之一般醫者均以爲絕無特效藥可以救治者，然而賴有鏈黴素（Streptomycin）之發明，則已使無可救治之絕症變爲絕對有辦法醫治之病症矣。又如肺炎，鼠疫，白濁，梅毒，疔瘡，糖尿，風濕以及流行性腦膜炎之類，曩昔人類之死於上述各症者亦不知其幾千萬人。然而賴有近代醫學之日益進步，則上述之種種奇難雜症亦已不足以危害人類。又如老年人之腦溢血（即中風）以及血管栓塞，狹心症等，前人均以爲無可救治之險症者，現在雖則未能認爲絕對可以醫治痊愈，然而其醫治原理則已闡發無遺且有不少人藉此獲得痊愈者矣，至於濾性毒之生物實驗，癌症之療法以及其他研究等等亦已日益精進，近於成功之階段。由此觀之，近年來醫學方面之成功實爲科學中之最偉大者。</p>
<p>顧醫學方面之進步雖已有驚人之成績如上所述，而辛動之醫學家以及生物學家等等仍復孜孜屹屹聯合工作，繼續不斷地在生物學方面作種種驚人之偉大實臉工作。近據醫報刋載，根據多年來之人體生物學實騐，已可逐漸明瞭人體細胞在生物學方而之各體生活意義。尤其對於人體細胞核以及細胞原質之呼吸作用（Zellatmung）更有重大之發明。蓋人體全身之細胞核與夫細胞原質之呼吸作用對係於人體之生理，病理以及人體疾病治療方法之原理等等均有重大之關係，而所以推動之調節之者則爲人體本身之酵素（Fermente）內分泌素Hormong）及維他命素（Vitamine）三者是也。據上述諸家之推論，人類之所以生，所以死，所以病，以及外界各物對於人身之各種感應作用均可藉此澈底明瞭且可藉此尋求長生之法云。</p>
<p>姑不論上述理論之能否成爲現實，而其在人體細胞之呼吸酵素研究方面則已有驚人之成功。蓋據奧國維也納查齊塞博士之報吿，已可藉酸化酵素（Oxydase）過酸化酵素（Peroxydase）過酸水素分解酵素（Katalase）之力量將中風後發生麻痺現象之手足以及患小兒性麻痺症後之肢體在某種情况中使其於最短期內完全活動如常云。茲特將其治療之原理叙述如下：</p>
<p>曩昔之醫者對於因病而起之肢體麻痺現象，例如小兒性麻痺症之麻痺，多發性硬化症（Multiple　Sclerose）之麻痺，中風後之麻痺以及脊髓炎症之麻痺等等皆認爲神經中樞早已全部破壞無法加以醫治。其實不然，此種武斷式之理論已因近世醫學之進步而不復存在。蓋病者體內之神經細胞及其神經中樞倘或未經破壞，則可以「助長細胞呼吸之酵素製劑」促使其恢復原有工作也。</p>
<p>據查齊寒博士意見，病後之麻痺現象共有二種：其一爲上述之神經細胞以及神經中樞已被破壞後之麻痺現象，又其一則爲神經細胞以及神經中樞尚破壞，僅其酵素之調簡機能已經失去作用因之發生一種麻痺現象者。上述之第一種麻痺現象目下尙無方法醫治，而第二種麻痺現象則可利用「促進細胞呼吸作用」之酵素藥膏擦塗患者皮內，使其於最短時期內（往往於數分鐘後）恢復原有工作，蓋其神經細胞以及神經中樞並未損壞，僅在不能活動之半麻醉狀態中，經受上述酵素製劑之刺激後遂能於最短期內回復其活動能力也。此種驚人之最新治療麻痺方法，實導源於匈牙利大學敎授Prof．marinescu氏之病理組織檢驗即「凡曾患有小兒性麻痺症者其脊髓前角神經細胞之呼吸酵素（Oxydase）完全發生失調狀態，遂使其所屬之肢體成爲麻痺云。」查齊塞氏根據此種實驗乃繼續加以研究而倡用此種酵素療法。今經其本人多年來之研究以及多數學者之臨床實驗，已獲得偉大之成功。茲附誌數例如下：</p>
<p>（一）有一美國軍官之四歲小孩，於二年前患小兒性麻痺症。厥後左腿完全麻痺，不能行動，又其左臀之肌肉亦麻痺萎縮，甚爲明顯。屢經二年來之種種方法診治（在美國）亦無效驗。於是來奧醫治。自經用酵素藥膏塗擦廿次後已能自由行走與其他小孩嬉戲。且能上下樓梯跳躍矣。</p>
<p>（二）有一十二歲之幼童，五年前患小兒性麻痺症其後則肩部肌肉完全麻痺，不能舉起手臂。自第一次用此法療治後即可平舉手臂過頂矣。</p>
<p>（三）有一十五歲女孩於十年前患小兒性麻痺症。此後則兩腿殘廢完全不能行走。一般醫者皆認爲毫無治愈希望。又在此種療法之實施以前加以覆驗亦證實其兩腿殘廢。詎於第一次擦藥之後，其殘廢之右腿即可作膝部之灣屈與平舉運動。惟其左腿則依然麻痺如故。但於第二次擦藥之後，則左腿亦可作膝部之自由伸屈。其後經過十七次之擦藥以後已可起立行走云。</p>
<p>（四）有一位勞工，於一九卅三年間患多發性硬化症。屢經診治無效。一九卅九年間受診於維也納神經學專家某敎授，但被認爲毫無痊愈希望並被送往養老院中。旋於一九四一年二月間爲某醫師用此藥塗擦，遂逐漸痊愈。且於同年八月間自覺能力充沛，可以回復工作，遂於是時要求離院回復工作。並於是年九月問起充任某陸軍醫師之助手云。</p>
<p>（五）有年已五十二歲之某君，患多發性硬化症已十一年，三年來更爲加劇。平時走路必須護士扶持。自用此藥塗擦後第一次即見功效無需護士扶持已可自由行走云。</p>
<p>此外對於中風後之麻痺脊髓炎之麻痺以及兩耳重聽之患者均有靈速之效騐。茲以篇幅關係，恕不具錄。總而言之，酵素療法之發明實爲患麻痺症者之福音。將來倘或繼續發展則其前途更爲遠大，惜此藥爲新鮮腺體製劑，必須現製現用，不能貯藏。吾輩黃臉孔之華人遠在天涯不能購用惟有引頷西望，翹盼燕旣耳。因此筆者頃已馳函詢間製法，究竟如何容後批露，惟予心心念念固甚願我國之病者不致失望也。</p>
<h3 id="c168">種痘史話 <a href="#c168" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e168" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">168</a></h3>
<p>— 花新人</p>
<p>免疫方法的實行，是由「種牛痘，防天花」開始的，在這一段光輝的歷史記錄中，我們可以發現「知識進展」的迂迴曲折情形，同時，我們對於這樣偉大發明人—琴納氏Edward　Jenner的功業，是當永遠歌頌的。實際上說，「種痘防天花」，古已有之。不過，像琴納那樣的用科學方法種痘去預防天花，在歷史上，是前無古人後無來者。我們知道，在十八世紀時，歐洲天花就流行，死亡載道，當時醫學方面所能一助的，就祇有用「天花病人身上的濃泡注射皮下」，可使患天花的病人比較輕些，這種方法呌做移種法Inoculation在歐洲，這種方法曾風靡一時，頗獲很多人的信仰。在一七一七年英國駐土大使未人馬麗蒙特嘉Lady　Mlary　Wortley　Montagu曾有一段描述：「在這裏，每至秋季九月中，有些老嫗專替他人移種天花，屆時，居民往往互相通知；若有意願種者，則集合十數人，或以團體爲單位，約老嫗來施種。老嫗隨身帶有一小匣，內盛天花漿，先詢受種者願刺開何處靜脈，選定後，即用針挑破脈管，　天化漿放人刺破之靜脈中，　　　痛苦。移種後第八天，寒熱交作，面部發出天花約二三十粒，痊愈後並不留疤痕」。再根據當時提倡移種法極力的醫師茂特蘭Dr．Maitland氏記載：英公主嘉羅琳Princess．Caroline曾要求國王喬治一世赦免六個已判死刑的囚犯，祗要他們願意接受試驗，即可獲得釋放的自由1721年，茂特蘭醫師便大瞻的作了這個試驗，成續圓滿，六個死刑犯得了大赦。1774年法王路易十四世，竟自己接受了這個試驗，並沒有什麼不良的反應。路易的女兒安東妮Marie　Antoinette的製帽技士露絲貝汀Mademoisclle　Rose　Bertin　特倣天花膿泡形式製作一頂女帽來記念國王偉大的供獻。王族貴裔們熱忱地都接受了「天花移種法」，當然，庶民們却特別感到興趣與熱望，認爲天花絕症有了救星。故對移種法頗爲奮發，在行行出狀元中，移種天花的風頭人物，當時，湯姆斯戴維士丹爾Thomas　Dimsdale實走了紅運。因爲，他不僅技術優良，精於方言，而且，又善於寫作，俄王聞其名，特禮聘前往莫斯科指導；王后該士琳Catherline　Ⅱ　首先接受移種爲民表率。同時，並令伊情人烏羅夫Gregory　Orlov及保爾公爵Doke　paul接種，成續斐然。從此之後，不僅宮中人士均須一致效法奉行，就是窮鄉僻壤之地亦趨之若驚，由這些記錄中，我們知道在琴納未發明種牛痘前，當時的社曾就已在研究這問題。同時，社曾人士對於「預防天花」的意識却早已奠定了基礎，不過，當時祗知其然而不知其所以</p>
<p>有一次，有人傳說，如果由牛身上傳來的天花，其病勢較由人而來者要輕得多，尤其是擠牛奶的娟人對此事，吏書言之有物，誇張其詞。擠奶的婦女曾證實，牛得的天花，可以在擠牛奶時，因皮膚破損，觸及牛身天花而傳染，擠牛奶的人在無形中便對天花有了免疫性。此事當時曾有一位擠牛奶的婦人吿訴過琴納，目稱忠過牛痘Cowpox可以不染天花，而天花更不能毀損她的花容玉貌。琴納聽了很感興趣甚爲注意這個問題，到1796年，琴納開始試驗工作，他由擠乳婦人沙娜麗絲Sarah　nelmes　手上取了牛痘漿，接種在八歲的孩子菲立蒲膀子上，菲立浦成了第一位供獻科學試驗的英雄。意大利名雕刻家蒙特法羅Montverde爲了紀念這科學上劃時代的偉大成就，曾造了一個銅像，表揚這一位八歲的孩子。這個被琴納作試驗的第一個種痘病人時，面容上所露出來的無窮的及心理上的恐怖，看上去，眞是神氣活現，在當時，琴納做這試驗工作並沒有十分把握，可是，菲立浦除了臂上生了一個膿皰，就像今天我們所見的牛痘一樣外，並沒有什麼痛苦。過了三個月，琴納又作第二步的試驗，將夭花膿皰內的毒質，再注入菲立浦皮下，以驗種痙的效力是否可靠。結果，證實了種過牛痘可以預防天花。琴納根據這些試驗結果，遂在1798年琴納氏完成了一個傑作，用嚴密中正的態度。明察審思善斷的智力，寫了一篇報吿，題名「爲探求西英人民所謂牛痘之因果」。不僅喚醒當時人士重視預防醫學，實亦爲今日我們辦理公共衛生者努力的典範。</p>
<p>流傳至美國後，用琴納氏種痘防天花試用的第一人爲哈佛醫科大學敎授萊德好施先生Benjamin　Waterhouse，在一八〇〇年他將自己的七個孩子試驗種痘。並且，還要他們去接觸有天花的病人，出乎意外地，這七個孩子並沒有染天花，1802年華先生又將已種過痘的十九個孩子，再種入汚穢的天花病毒的皮下，結果，有兩個孩子未曾稀牛痘，染了天花，而其他的孩子却安然無恙。經過這次的嚴密試驗，進一步更證明了「牛痘爲抵制天花穩妥之鏢客」（借用波士頓衛生局之標語）1805年，精明强練的拿破崙將軍，曾手令三軍必須種痘，這是牛痘發明後比其他任何醫學新發明推行效率增速的表示。惜當時因科學發展下速，反對派潛勢仍大，其中以敎會中人士反對最烈，他們反對之藉口說這種工作去違反神意，反對派更用種痘後人們會染得牛性爲宣傳；但事實勝於雄辯，科學工作獲得了最後勝利。</p>
<p>據一九四七年五月美國生活雜誌所載：在三月一日級約市某旅館，有墨西哥城來一旅客，突因病逝世，後經證實爲天花，市衛生局據報大驚失色，因恐其蔓延，市長杜威，下令全市十七萬五千個戰時防空警報機關發出警號；市民初聆警號，以爲大禍將臨，後經宣布原因，隨指定集體種痘地點；普遍施行種痘。總計，紐約一市每日受種人數有五十萬人。四天內竟達二百萬人。自此事發生後十天，因查無新病例發現，衛生當局始略安心。這件事若發生在上海，我想市長及衛生局長決不會如此「虛驚」。因爲，天花，在我國是司空見慣的流行病。</p>
<p>我們得承認自種痘發明後，天花雖然仍未根絕；但，最低限度可以說，天花不是絕症，可以預防。因此，琴納的功業是永埀不朽，正如同一八〇六年美總統傑弗遜氏致書琴納所言：「將使天下後世之人，由讀史而知自古最惹人之天花悉爲我公所撲滅，今幸無噍類矣」。循是以往，迄乎今茲，我們對於種痘是應該努力認眞推行。但，以言暢行無阻，固猶未也，否則種痘我自爲之，天花照常流行，夫復何言哉！</p>
<p>俊靑按花君此文叙述歐美人士對於接種牛痘之擁護情形，眞令人無限感喟。方今內亂頻仍，天花盛行。即以上海一埠而言，天花亦甚猖獗。不特當局未有更完善之方法加以防範，即以一般民衆而言，亦有漠不關心之概。嗟乎，「民不畏死，奈何以死恐之？」民衆豈其眞不知畏死耶？亦惟有生不如死，遂致不暇畏死耳。噫！</p>

<p>— 梁俊青編</p>
<p>（一）月經困難之治療方法</p>
<p>張醫師問　有年四十一歲之婦人，四年來患月經困難症，每次月經來時腰痠背痛，下腹漲痛，月經有時很多，有時很少，顏色紫黑，且多白帶，經檢查後認爲子宮頸部有水泡囊甚多兼有輕度發炎，似爲脫膜性月經困難症之一種。茲問有何方法療冶。可否用愛克司光將其卵巢照壞？抑或使用一刮子宮手術？</p>
<p>王醫師答　來信所述之症情不甚詳細，未能作肯定性答覆。惟月經過多症與月經困難症以及子宮附屬器瘤腫等均可因子宮發炎而發生，而此種發炎則多半屬於結核性。蓋據近年來多數婦科專家之研究，子宮及其附屬器之患結核症者爲數甚多（女子之不孕者與之甚有關係）而向來不爲人注意者也。此外來信所述之病症亦可因子宮內膜炎或子宮外膜炎而發生。（其中當然亦可因輸卵管炎或卵巢炎而起）。若能檢查病者之病歷及其血液化驗報吿（如白血球之多寡，白血球分類之情形以及華氏血淸反應情形）以及月經前後之體溫情形，則可決定其症之原因屬於何種性質。若爲非發炎性之子宮附屬器腫大症，則可將其割除。而其割出物亦可加以組織學方面之檢驗。至於刮子宮之方法則或未妥，蓋恐其有發炎狀態存在，而促其發生一種不良之結果。且所患者若爲子宮內膜組織增生狀態而附生於其他部位（Endometrio　is）則雖刮子宮亦無效也。在可於避免之情况下，最好勿用愛克司光將卵巢照壞，以免發生許多不良之後果。惟若有上述之Endometriosis者則當然可以應用此法，蓋此種病症極難醫治，雖將其處割除亦不易爲功也。</p>
<p>（二）促使頭髪生長之方法</p>
<p>陳醫師問　有無方法可使脫落後之頭髮再行生長。</p>
<p>馬醫師答　據近世之研究結果，至今尙無一種可靠而有效之生髮藥。二十年前德國有一種生髮藥各Humagsolan，曾經感行一時，旋因效力不甚可靠而歸於沉寂。最近瑞士羅氏藥廠曾經大登廣吿，盛稱其生髮藥「品鼎」爲生髮的維生素，內含本多生酸即維他命Ｂ演化物可使灰髮變黑，脫髮再生，且以各種化學試驗及臨床報吿爲根據。此種以維他命爲根據之生髮素當然在理論方面絕對有其存在之價値，但據私人方面之臨診實驗則其效用亦不甚明顯。似與理想相差尙遠，仍須繼續研究也。至於早期之禿頂現象，乃爲遺傳性質。若係普遍性之頭髮脫落則與內分泌不無關係（即普通人所謂之腎虧）而頭皮部份之患有皮脂漏症（Seborrhoe）亦有甚大之關係也。紫外綫照射頭皮似亦有生髮之作用，惟其成效甚爲微小且亦爲時不久即又脫髮如故。予以爲若能將頭皮之皮脂漏症治好，則除濟傳性外有許多脫髮情形可以改善，至於內服砒製劑，則實未見其有效也。</p>
<p>（三）臉部皮脂漏之治法</p>
<p>何醫師問　在臨診期間常有靑年前來詢問臉部皮脂漏之原因及其治法。前在醫校知而不詳故其治療亦有效有不效。不知近世醫藥進步，有無更新之理論與療法？</p>
<p>王醫師答　臉部之皮脂漏僅爲局部現象，其頭皮內以及耳部頸部胸前等處均可有之。其原因甚爲複雜，有因皮脂分泌過多，有因內分泌發生障碍，有因體內物質新陳代謝發生障碍，有因所進食物失常（例如食油脂之食物太多或則食朱古力糖太多）以及瓶狀稈菌（Flaschenbacillus）作祟等等，皆爲其直接或間接之原因。險部之皮脂漏往往與座瘡聯合發生，不可不知。其治法以愛克司光照射爲最妥，惟須由專家執行，且須以最小量照起。若用量過份則可摧殘皮膚之主要組織爲害不淺。前人有用內分泌素治療而見效者。但其份量之需要因人而異，甚難測定，醫師中往往有因其用量不準確未能獲得效用遂致擯而不用者，胥此故也。患者若有進食失常之原因，則其療法當然須從節制飲食方面着手。有時用人工太陽燈或紫外綫照射亦甚有效力。至於局部方面則以百份一至三之水楊酸製劑或百份二之硫磺製劑（如水劑粉劑或藥膏之類）敷之，問或有所補助也。</p>

<p>— 編者</p>
<p>我們醫師界裏的健將范守淵醫師競選國大代表成功的消息已經在前幾天的報上正式公佈了。這是使我們應該慶祝的一樁事情。因爲范醫師在最近的兩年以來任勞任怨地爲我們的醫事公會盡了他最大的努力，他聯絡了我們醫師界裏的感情，他溝通了我們醫師界裏的隔闔，他設法把醫師公會的會務發展起來，他盡力把會員方面的糾紛消弭下去。他並且以市夾議員的資格在市參議會裏為我們醫師爭回權益。像他這樣不避勞怨爲大衆謀福利的人那能不爲我們所擁戴呢？所以在這次競選國民代表大會代表的時候他所得的選舉票數最多。這眞是衆望所歸的了。而今他正式當選國大代表，當然他會像以前一樣在他的本位中發揮他的過人的天才。這是用不着我們再來補充的。好罷，范醫師！我們慶祝你的成功，也是我們醫藥界的成功。</p>

<p>— 平齋</p>
<p>戰前，一張十元的鈔票可以買一担米，現在是丟在地上都沒有人要的了，如果用一張十元鈔票引着了火來點香烟，恐怕比用一根自來火還要便宜得多。</p>
<p>前幾天我呌三輪車的時候，看見車墊上有一張一千塊的鈔票，我就吿訴他車墊上有錢。站在旁邊的四五個三輪車夫都圍　來看，一看祇有一千塊錢，大家哈哈大笑。結果，我呌的那一輛三輪車的車夫就把它塞在自己的衣袋裏，却聽見他的同伴們儘量在取笑他：「傳介做人家！」「胃口太好了！」</p>
<p>彷佛檢起一張一千元的鈔票，巳經是一件「坍毫」的事情。</p>
<p>同時，每一個乘電車的人却都又感到零找的麻煩，尤其是現在有一級票價規定爲六千元，無論乘客或賣票員都覺得頭痛。乘客付五千元當然不行，是「揩油」，賣票員也決不會和你客氣；但如果你付了一萬元呌他找呢，賣票員事實上的確往往沒有這麼多一千元的鈔票可找，結果自然大多是笑納了一萬元，給你一張六千元的票子，對你說一聲「謝謝儂！」許多乘客反正也不希罕這四千元找頭，漸漸地也安之若素了。</p>
<p>但是，也有一部份乘客覺得是吃了虧，或者覺得姑不問這件事情之小，而在他是違背了正直之道，於是就不免爭執起來，往往就以乘客的面紅耳赤開始，以賣票員的冷嘲熱諷結束。</p>
<p>於是，每一個上海人都感覺到一種矛盾：在自己到銀行去取錢時，惟恐銀行裏給你「爛污票子」，如果你要拿一千萬，而他給你的竟都是票面五千元的票子，你心里也許已經感到不耐煩——如果他給你的都是一千元或甚至五百元的票子，那就無論你平日的涵養工夫怎樣好，也忍不住要發脾氣，說那個銀行辦事員存心和你作對了。收進的時候，爲携帶方便起見，鈔票的票面惟恐其不大，鈔票更惟恐其不新。但在電車上，却又惟恐自己袋裘全是簇新的五千元票面的關金票，零找費時，有時竟會呌你錯過了站頭。</p>
<p>我有一個姓黎的同學，他是讀文學的，想像力特別豐富，常常要想入非非地的幻想那些破爛鈔票的歷史。他常說：「也許這張票子曾給一個滿身瘡　的乞丐拿過；也許又到過一個生大麻瘋的人手裏……可怕，可怕！」於是他身邊就常備一個盛阿司匹靈藥片的空玻璃瓶，裘面放滿了酒精，每不得已時拿過一張稍稍破舊的鈔票後，他一定把酒精倒一點在手掌裏，趕快將拿過那張鈔票的手指在酒精中擦之不巳，說是「消毒」。然而他身邊却總還是帶一些那種他所認爲可怕的小票，因爲他最恨躭擱時間，無論買東西或買電車票之類，每遇零數，他一定要自已凑齊得一毫不錯，然後欣然而出。</p>
<p>實在，像這位黎君一般的顧客，凡是商店或正直的賣票員是一定都很歡迎的，因爲直捷痛快，交易做得爽爽氣氣。但是，天下像黎君這一類的人恐怕本來就未必甚多，尤其在上海，大概就祗他一人而已。於是，大多數上海人今日的一個問題—零找問題，就至今無法解決。</p>
<p>但零找問題之令人頭痛，倒並不止中國爲然。外國也有的，而且，這個「外國」竟就是最富麗的美國。</p>
<p>在一八六〇年後幾年內，美國發生了零找大恐慌。各公司商號便自動製造了若干「代價輔幣」（是硬幣，不是戰時上海出現過的「代價券」），輔幣上印好公司牌號地址，另一面便印着「麵包一大塊」或「啤酒一瓶」等字樣。鼓　這種「代價幣」的商店總數在一萬家以上，通用的「代價幣」至少在二千五百萬枚以上。但到了一八六四年，紐約的一家酒吧間的老板，竟然在發出了二萬枚啤酒代價幣之後，來一個拒絕兌現！結果當然是老板捉將官裏去，而美國政府也頒佈了一項法律，禁止民間私鑄任何通貨，「代價幣」才消聲匿跡，成爲歷史上的名辭了。</p>
<p>但眞正解決了美國這次零找恐慌的並非任何法律之力，而是美國政府澈底整頓了輔幣的發行額，「角子」一多，零找就不成問題了。</p>
<p>也許我們今天談改革幣制尙　太早，但不改革則已，要改革　實在應當先讓我人的口袋裏可以常常聽到可可噹噹的「角子」撞擊的聲音。</p>

<p>美國最怪的一張唱片是一個黑人爵士音樂家裴契脫灌音的，他一人同時演奏了六種不同的樂器：高低音撒克沙風各一，小喇叭一，鋼琴一，大提琴一，還有鼓，灌音的時候先灌第一種樂器的音樂，奏完後，再在同一張片子上灌上第二種樂器的音樂，一直連來六次。這隻樂曲的名字呌「祭司」。</p>
<p>歐美人飲各種不同的酒時，考究的人們都用不同的酒杯，故第一流的餐館飯店中，至少須備六十套形狀大小都不同的酒具</p>
<p>美國牢獄的設備雖佳，但囚犯越獄的事情還是屢見不鮮。以前，每遇囚犯越獄，監獄的看守者往往並無處分。最近才由美國國會通過了一條法律，凡遇越獄時，監獄看守應判失察罪，科罰金五百美元，並處徒刑一年。</p>

<p>— 介夫</p>
<p>前閱申報自由談載有凌　漢閣所寫「吾校之友」一文，談論北京大學往事，老友不相聞問數十年，藉此可知梗概，誠足慰也。筆者爲凌霄漢閣同班同學，一向服務工程界，高興的時候也要要筆桿登登報，民元時「介夫」之名，老友想尙記億。我輩在今日談「京師大學」往事，彷如唐時白髮宮人談天寳遺事，凌　漢閣所談尙有未盡，茲補充一則以作響應，並以吿北大校友們。</p>
<p>前淸開辦京師大學時，先設仕學館，進士館，師範館，及譯學館四部份，前兩館均係爲科舉中人補習新學而設，葉玉甫先生恭綽即仕學館生，關穎人先生賡麟即進士館生。師範館則爲準備興學校師資而設，譯學館則造就繙譯西書人材。譯學館獨多翩翩公子，當時有「相公堂子」之稱。我國第一屆國會衆議院議長吳景溓，前外交部兩廣特派負朱兆莘，均係師範館學生，顧孟餘先生係譯學館學生。其他曾任要職或有聲於時者尙多，茲不過信筆舉出數人耳。其後進備開辦分科大學，先設大學預科，在各省招考學生，保送到京入學，筆者係當時粵省考取廿四各預科生之一。當時國內新學人才極少，故除國學外，其他各科目敎授多聘外國人，英·美·德·法·俄·比·日·荷蘭，應有盡有，幾乎可稱爲國際學校。</p>
<p>大學堂之首長初不稱爲校長，而名爲「大學堂監督」，以三品京堂職兼任，名位頗高，曾任此職者皆知名之士。記得嚴幾道先生復曾任此職，嚴有足疾，每到校在大門下車後，再乘二人肩興至監督室，又有阿芙蓉　，學生議其老腐敗，作漫畫一人吸食鴉片狀，登報，題名曰「烟復」，嚴無顏，不久辭職。繼之者爲百歲老人馬相伯先生良，時馬先生已近八十高齡，學生嫌其太老，舉代表多人去見，吿之曰：「北京大學不是好辦的，嚴先生已經知難而退了，你老先生這麼大的年紀，何必來自尋煩惱呢？在家裘休息休息不好嗎？如果爲的是每月三百元的薪水也好辦，我們學生每月凑三百元送給先生也可以的呀！」馬老先生哈哈大笑，連說：「拿來給我呀！拿來給我呀！」馬頗詼諧，且善辭令，翌日召集學生訓話中有：「所稱爲大學校者，並非因爲學校的房子大，學生的脾氣大，也並非因爲校長的年紀大，（還有甚麼……大，記不淸了）而是要怎麼樣怎麼樣才配稱爲大學的」等語。但馬先生亦不久於其位，數月後即辭去，可見北大學生的鋒芒利害，不自五四運動始也。</p>

<p>— 公華</p>
<p>某天白宮的早上。</p>
<p>國務院秘書吉姆爲了要公謁見總統林肯，由傳達者引導至一個廣大的客廳，走到廊下，旁邊有一個男子正在不停地擦着皮鞋，吉姆無意中低頭一看，不覺吃驚立停脚步。</p>
<p>總統林肯不停地在擦他自己的皮鞋。</p>
<p>「閣下身居總統，做這樣的事，被人看見，頗不雅觀，尤其是被貴族婦人……」秘書吉姆往常聽人在背後說總統時常露出像鄉下人一樣粗野的態度，今日一見不覺脫口而出。</p>
<p>於是林肯露出滿臉微笑對着吉姆驚異的眼光；「啊！擦皮鞋是可恥的事麼？吉姆君！那是不對的。大總統與擦皮鞋者同是爲世人而勞動的公僕。世間應無卑賤的職業，惟有心地卑劣的人們。」</p>
<p>林肯高聲地說，一面用還沾着鞋油和其他氣味的手，接了吉姆拿來的重要公文，開始用擦皮鞋時一樣的熱心，一心閱讀着。</p>
<h3 id="c175">愛因斯坦軼事 <a href="#c175" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e175" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">175</a></h3>
<p>— 冷冷</p>
<p>相對論鼻祖愛因斯坦在兒童時代舉止遲鈍，態度羞澀，連說話也不周全，父母憂慮他的天資不及常兒，學校裏的敎師對他搖頭表示絕望，喚他笨蟲，認爲不堪造就無法敎育。誰知這麼一個奇笨無比的孩子，在六十年後的今日，竟被全世界公認爲當代傑出的聰明偉人，古今最大的思想家之一呢？</p>
<p>愛因斯坦對於名譽富貴或奢華看得輕淡非凡；據說有一次，大西洋上某輪船的船長，爲了優待愛因斯坦，特地讓出全船最精美的房間恭候他，誰想到竟被他嚴詞拒絕，不願意接受這種特別優待，情願自己睡在最下等的統艙裏。當他受美國紐約普靈斯頓大學之聘前往講學時，他爲了避免新聞記者的訪問麻煩，預先囑咐他的朋友在船尙在到埠以前，先行中途秘密以駁船接去換乘汽車駛校。</p>
<p>在目前，解釋愛因斯坦的相對論學說的書籍，至少已出版了九百册以上，但據愛因斯坦親口說過，現在世界上能够眞正了解他的相對論的，却只有十二人，就是他的太太也在額外。</p>
<p>愛因斯坦曾用一個簡明的例子解釋相對論；一個美麗的姑娘伴你對坐一小時，你好像覺得只有一分鐘的短促；要是你在火爐邊獨坐一分鐘，就覺得像有一小時的久長了。—起初聽來，好像有些道理，其實就是相對論。</p>
<p>據愛因斯坦太太說：她丈夫在思想上是極願遵守秩序的，但在實際生活上，他願意採取隨便主義，不願受秩序的拘束，要想做什麼就做什麼，歡喜那時做就那時做。他替自己立下了兩條規則；一條就是無論什麼「規則」都不要，另一條是不爲任何人的意見所支配。</p>
<p>可是他有時候碰到太太就不得不違反第二條規則；譬如當她邀請了朋友在家茶聚時，她想要求她丈夫參與她們的盛會，但愛因斯坦往往會粗厲的回答：「不！不！我不能去！我不能去！我不能忍受這麼的騷擾，使我不能安心工作，我要立刻離開此地！」</p>
<p>愛因斯坦太太眞會忍耐，等待他發怒完畢，再用幾好話，便使他服服貼貼地跟她下樓參與她們的茶聚。</p>
<p>愛因斯但的日常生活十分簡單，他平日總穿着一套不整齊的舊衣服，不歡喜常戴帽子，在浴室裏時常吹口哨或哼歌曲。他雖然打算解決煩複的宇宙之謎，但他認爲不能將人生的享用弄得過分的複雜，所以他在洗澡後刮鬍子時，不用刮面香皂而就用洗澡肥皂，他認爲兩種肥皂眞是浪費。</p>
<p>愛因斯坦的軼事眞多，讓筆者再說一個作爲結束吧！有一天，他在柏林市公共汽車上和賣票員爭執起來，他以爲零錢找錯了，等到賣票員把零錢重數一遍以後，知道錯的是愛因斯坦自己，於是又把零錢交還他，並說了一句近乎嘲諷我們大數學家及思想家的幽默話：「這一次的錯誤是因爲先生不會計數！」</p>

<p>誰排閶　嘯高臺，萬里雲霓極望哀，大好頭顱孤注擲，不情宇宙老懷灰！艱難正是庸愚福，破壞還成建設才，太息吾生今已矣，頹然一醉臥蒿萊。</p>

<p>江水東流海日西，荆南風物不堪題，漸遙漸淡還鄉夢，聽盡年年杜宇啼。</p>
<h3 id="c178">收藏家的印 <a href="#c178" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e178" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">178</a></h3>
<p>—</p>
<p>「收藏」在各樣嗜好裏比較算是最値得同情的，書畫牌版金石銅瓷一切等等，長學問，廣見識，遺興養神，總比狂舞濫賭，桃色黃色黑籍白籍那些把戲高明些。但亦需要一種智慧去控制平衡，若太着迷或入魔道，則不能有益，反而爲累，不能開拓胸襟，反而閉塞聰明。</p>
<p>淸道光初年，常熟孫翰林（原湘）爲金匱錢梅溪作「　談」序，於「收藏」一鬥說：「概雲烟之過眼也。一書內錢氏自己亦說「收藏是雅事，原似雲烟過眼，可以過而不留，若一貪戀，生覬覦，則變雅爲俗矣。試觀古來收藏家，無有傳之數百年子孫尙能守者！」語極通透。</p>
<p>「收藏」與「過眼」字面上像是矛盾的，旣當作烟雲過眼，又何苦緊緊收藏。所以錢氏說：「高江村旣云世人竭資力以事收蓄，與決性命以　富貴者何異。而又有小印日：「江村三十年精力所聚」，可見其好之篤，嗜之深，未必能作雲烟過眼觀也。」其實，嗜好是心情，收藏是當然的事實，與「達觀」並不矛盾。錢先生自己就是收藏大家，同時又是個達觀者。</p>
<p>項城袁寒雲，文藝好手，嗜古加命，收藏品類極多而精，版本富倍諸友，曾鐫一印章，文曰「子孫永寳之」，後來又覺所望太奢，改印「與身俱存亡」，可謂沉痛之至，亦止一時感情作用，後來居津極窘，心愛之物，亦不免出而換錢，則子孫固未必永遠寳愛，本人亦有時難共存亡。所以他的印文所表現者，仍不過自己當時之酷　而已。</p>
<p>姑蘇葉菊裳翰林，生平窮搜碑帖及各項拓片，其緣督廬日記，無日不與甚麼「帖賈」「碑估」爲緣。及丙申年，其獨子病故，悲感無已，說是「家嗣云亡，楹書無托」，又說「篋中故紙，將來不知流落何人之手！」又說：「平生苦心搜訪，將來誰爲收拾？言之增慟！」似乎葉老先生亦是希望「子孫永寳」之一人。人若無後，遺物終究要散失了，後兩年有已故的翰林黃公之子把他父親的寳物賣給琉璃廠，葉老先生又慨然記下幾句話：「黃本甫來談，再同遺書以二千八百金歸之廠肆，有子能讀，尙不能守，吾輩可以勘破幻夢矣！」於是他亦恍然大悟了。</p>
<p>原來世世保守之說，造端於封建，而倡導於帝王。歷史上的傳國玉璽，以及宮殿鼎鐘上鎊的「永寳」字樣，都可證明與所謂「傳之萬世」及「國祚無疆」同一意義。</p>
<p>收藏家於是常常準備些「家藏」「世守」等等印章，蓋在所收的碑板圖書上，結果都如錢氏所說及葉氏所慨，總不免散落他方。因爲沒有子孫或子孫不肖，或有子能讀而貧不可耐，或者時事喪亂，城市變遷，皆可以打破「世守」的事實。莫說古物，即如房田產業，朱門大宅，易主改姓，亦是，當事。帝王家老說萬代無疆，亦不過好總的話兒，好看的字樣·不但事實不能，於理亦馬不必。好東西人人可以鑒賞，永遠封鎖一家一姓，對於古物亦不是眞正愛惜者。</p>
<p>見解明爽一些的先生們的印章，便不那樣了，選用「嗣守」二字，驗明某物曾屬某前輩之後，自己就算「繼續典守」的一個監護人，並暗示將來若轉到別家手裏，亦希望他能識貨，能保存，如李老翰林聯琇於碑帖，即蓋「聯琇嗣守」，是愛惜珍物，不是自私，是職責的嗣，不是家族的嗣，是「傳賢」不是「傳子」，頗有「天下爲公」氣象，兼澈底愛物的精神。再則「曾藏某某處」，某某即現有者之名號。預用「曾」字冠苜，意思是遲平總要歸於他人，與「曾經我手」俱是達觀，將來別人得去，看了圖章必先失笑，他已經把話說在前頭了。</p>
<p>惟其如此，所以在許多碑帖前後甚至天地幅，蓋些「某人藏」「某人守」「某人過目」「某人」「某家」各式各樣的岡章，非常熱鬧，而買帖的人對此更感興味，那是經過了多少前輩的證明。同時，這些圖章又成了被考據被鑒賞的寶物，其興味或比本帖還要濃重。</p>
<p>錢梅溪又言，收藏家有三等：一曰賞鑒，二曰好事，三曰謀利。謀利者，臨摹百出，作僞萬端，以取財物，是市井小人。按此即「骨董鬼」之謂也。仿造，截捕，薰染，其術多端，然無論如何不能逃於眞賞者之目。鑒別眞僞新舊之法，第一須從「氣韻」「精神」著意，「做舊」者斷不能比「眞舊」，摹仿者斷不能混眞品。北平廠甸大會，宋元明仿造名人墨蹟，無所不有，其紙絹筆畫亦煞工夫，但仿品必右幾處敗筆，一看不顯者，再看無不了然矣。</p>
<p>近年生活高漲，舊家出手佳品不少。半夢函述滬上頗有眞價錢，眞東西。一部元明手札第一頁即是松雪原墨，有人以代價四億買去，並不算貴（合現洋則有限矣）！此間劉君藏有松雪人物畫册十餘幅，每幅有松雪親題，曾由紹裕姪介紹來見，囑予鑒定，觀覽一過，神團氣聚，眞蹟無疑。有古玩行已出價黃貨十條，原主尙未肯脫手，其珍重可知。</p>

<p>第十二章　萍水姻緣　（一〇二）</p>
<p>那晚綺紈回到中東飯店，島雲業已回來了，綺紈不露一點聲色，一見而先笑道：「你事情忙，我等不了你，今天已經去見我母親了。母親見我到上海，非常歡喜，並且知道我們的事，非常贊成，祇嗔怪我爲什麼今天不和你同去。我答應她，明天無論如何，總去叩見。你明天無論有什麼要緊事，也要丟開，先辦這事好了。不然，老人家可要生氣！」島雲乍聽綺紈去見她母親，很是擔心，後來聽到柳如對綺紈婚事，沒有問題，才放了心，說道：「這個當然要去的，我本打算把我們事情都籌備好了，再去叩見岳母，現在你旣然吿訴岳母，那末我的预定計劇，就要變更，我明天一淸平就先和你去。」綺紈道：「那倒也不必，我母親每天下午兩點鐘才起床呢！」島雲道：「那末，我們就等兩點鐘以後去叩見。應該帶什麼禮物？」綺紈這：「這個憑你辦吧，我可不出主意。」島雲道：「我們來時太匆促，沒帶北平土產，現在預備什麼禮品，我想不出來。」綺紈道：「你何必爲這些事費腦筋，我母親並不注重這個，只要你見而能討她歡喜，那就再好沒有。」島雲道：「我一定能討她歡喜·她本來就喜歡我，現在又聯成親戚，你又是她最愛的女兒，那有不喜歡我的道理。」綺紈道：「但願如此！」島雲聽了，也不知綺紈是什麼意思，不敢多問。那一晚過去，第二百一淸早，島雲便忙着出去，備辦禮物，到下午兩點鐘，二人坐一輛汽車，來到明德里，叩見柳如，柳如一見島雲，表示非常親密，問長問短，又說能結上這門親，在她老人心上，是非常滿意的。隨後又問他對製片公司如何計劃。島雲知道柳如在上海電影圈裏，很有聯絡，消息也很靈通，便推說大本營是在香港，雖然勉强指出許多財東幫忙，言詞之間便不很自然，柳如是老於世故的，祇由她問了幾句，早看出島雲所說的話，是靠不住的，當下不露聲色，極力敷衍他一氣，留二人用過晚飯，才送他回去，臨走時候，背地吩咐綺紈，務要明日再來。綺紈給柳如如此示意，對於島雲便增了厭惡之心。</p>

<h3 id="e1">The North China Pacification Conference Yesterday Resolved: New Land Law to be Implemented in the Pacification Zone; Raising the Authority of Commanders in Each Pacification Zone <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 18th Dispatch] The North China Pacification Conference continued on the 18th. Present were the chairmen of various provinces in North China, commanders of various pacification zones, heads of relevant departments and commissions, and dozens of responsible officials from the Ministry of National Defense. A general meeting was held in the morning, chaired by Bai Chongxi. The land reform component of the overall North China war plan was discussed, and Minister of Land Administration Li Jingzhai gave an explanation on the matter. The conference unanimously agreed to implement the new land law, based on the Three Principles of the People's "Land to the Tiller" principle, and to formulate measures for land management in the pacification zone. The new land law will stipulate that in principle, tenant farmers who have had land distributed to them by the Communists in the pacification zone will not be required to return the land to the landlords after it is recovered, but will continue to cultivate it. However, the government will establish a land bank to issue land bonds, still preserving some of the landlords' rights and interests, and will implement measures such as awarding land to veterans. From 3 PM to 5 PM in the afternoon, the general meeting continued, discussing the military component of the overall North China war plan, including raising the authority and division of responsibilities of pacification zone commanders. The Executive Yuan submitted an amendment, which was explained by Secretary-General Gan Naiguang. After discussion, it was decided that the authority of pacification zone commanders should be expanded, giving them the power to direct and supervise the political and economic work in their respective zones, but this power will be authorized by the provincial government. The method will be: the inspection commissioners of the pacification zone will be recommended by the pacification zone commander and appointed by the provincial government. From 5 PM to 7 PM, group review meetings were held. The military group was convened by Tang Enbo and Lin Wei, the political group by Zhang Lisheng and Gan Naiguang, and the economic group by Yu Hongjun and Shen Honglie.

<p>The Tragedy of His Death Shakes Heaven and Earth</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Xuzhou, 18th Dispatch] In this northern Jiangsu campaign, District Chief Luo Chunxian's heroic death in the Battle of Nansishui truly shook heaven and earth and moved gods to tears. The invading Chen bandits numbered about six regiments. District Chief Luo, faced with a sudden attack and the failure to evacuate the populace, led his meager force of 160 self-defense soldiers, determined to defend the area to the death in order to avoid loss of life and property for the people. They fought a bloody battle with the bandits throughout the night. Overwhelmed by superior numbers and lacking reinforcements, he attempted to commit suicide with his pistol to apologize to the district residents, but his guards prevented him. Unable to break through, the bandits sent three parties into the town to persuade him to surrender. Not only was District Chief Luo unmoved, but he killed the emissaries to demonstrate his resolve and continued to fight hard. When all was lost, just as he was about to use his last bullet to end his own life, he was captured by bandits who suddenly entered the town. During the escort, the bandit brigade commander summoned Luo for a conversation. District Chief Luo seized the opportunity to snatch the bandit brigade commander's pistol and counterattack, but missed his target and was shot dead by other bandits. When the tragic news spread, the residents of Sishui wept together in unison. It is reported that District Chief Luo was a former political worker.</p>
<h3 id="e11">Washington Figures Discuss China's Situation: Progress Made in Recent Months; Truman's Policy Will Facilitate Military Aid to China <a href="#e11" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c11" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">11</a></h3>
<p>[US Information Service, Washington, 17th Dispatch] Authoritative figures here believe that the situation in China has generally improved in the past four months. It is reported that a portion of the surplus military supplies from the Pacific region is being shipped to the National Government. However, it is generally believed that trained leadership is more important than guns and ammunition.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Washington, 17th Dispatch] Diplomatic sources today stated that President Truman's anti-Soviet policy will allow the Chinese government to purchase more surplus military supplies from the United States, stored in the United States and Hawaii. A draft is under consideration, but the government authorities remain firm that the United States should not directly bear the responsibility for the Nanjing government's suppression of the communists.</p>

<p>Secretary of State Marshall still says the U.S. must resist the pressure to get bogged down in a quagmire so that the limited military strength of the United States is not dispersed, but can be used to counter Soviet aggression in Europe. This is consistent with his strategy during World War II, which focused on Europe as the main theater. Marshall's advisors believe that the country's major needs are a lack of talented generals and the need for better training of the national army. Regarding the issue of talented generals, it is believed that there has been real improvement in recent months. Some generals have been appointed to key positions, and a certain general, whom Marshall privately held largely responsible for the military failures in the Northeast, has been dismissed, all of which are clear evidence.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, New York, 17th Dispatch] The Federal Council of Churches of Christ in America, the largest Protestant organization in the United States, recently urged the United States to aid China to help promote stability and public order in China and alleviate the suffering of the people. The proposal of the council was approved by the Executive Committee, in which all twenty-seven Protestant denominations participate, and in principle, endorsed President Truman's message to Congress on February 19th regarding aid to China. The proposal stated that the US government should take steps to assist China, so as to alleviate the suffering of the Chinese people and give the country an opportunity to stabilize itself through its own efforts.</p>
<h3 id="e13">Remittances from Silver and Money Exchanges Must Include Real Names <a href="#e13" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c13" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">13</a></h3>
<p>The Ministry of Finance has Formulated Five Measures</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 18th Dispatch] Various silver and money exchanges must use the real names of their customers. The Ministry of Finance has repeatedly formulated measures and ordered them to be followed. Recently, to ensure strict implementation, the ministry has further stipulated that the names and addresses of remitters should also be strictly investigated when handling remittance business. Five new measures have been formulated and circulated for compliance: (1) When conducting domestic remittances, whether by money order or telegraphic transfer, silver and money exchanges must have the remitter fill in the remitter's and payee's real names (or the full name of the organization, company, or factory) and detailed addresses on the remittance application form, and the remitting exchanges must record them in the remittance account at all times, without any omissions. (2) If the payee of a telegraphic transfer is replaced by a telegraphic registration number or the remitting exchange's current account number, the remitter should still be asked to provide the payee's original name and address so that it can be recorded. If the remitter requests that a blank-headed remittance order be issued, the remitter should also be asked to fill in the payee's name and address as a basis for accounting. (3) For all remittances handled by the paying exchange (including remittances left for the payee to collect, remittances entrusted to the paying exchange to collect, and remittances in the nature of traveler's checks, etc.), the remitter should be asked to explain the reason why the address of the person leaving the remittance and the payee is not yet determined, and the remitting exchange should record the reason in the ledger. (4) With the exception of interbank transfers, government fund transfers from military and political agencies, and transfers of funds from production, public utility, and transportation enterprises, which should be handled in the name of the agency or enterprise, the paying exchange should require the payee to provide a reliable guarantee before releasing ordinary customer remittances of 200 million yuan or more per transaction. If the guarantee is not provided and the remittance is released, the remitting exchange will be held responsible if it is found that the payee's name is false or the address does not match. (5) Silver and money exchanges that violate the above provisions will be subject to disciplinary action by the Ministry of Finance, depending on the severity of the circumstances, in accordance with the provisions of Articles 13 and 14 of the Measures for Strengthening the Control of Financial Business.</p>
<h3 id="e14">On the First Anniversary of the Recapture of Yan'an, The Communist Bandits Proclaim Their Attack Is Within Sight But Unattainable <a href="#e14" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c14" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">14</a></h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Xi'an, 18th Dispatch] For the past half-month, the Communist bandits in northern Shaanxi have been proclaiming that they will attack Yan'an on March 19th. The facts have proven that this is a fantasy, and the impregnable defensive fortifications around Yan'an remain within sight but unattainable for the Communist bandits. Relevant parties today gave reporters an overview of the battlefield in northern Shaanxi to share their impressions on the eve of the first anniversary of the recapture of Yan'an. They stated: Yan'an and Luochuan are important strongholds for us, and it will be difficult for the bandit army to "capture strong points." Bandit troops are appearing between Ganquan and Fuxian, but we still maintain a line of communication between Yan'an and Luochuan, and they are not two isolated "points." The highway line and the four county towns of Hancheng, Heyang, Chengcheng, and Pucheng have been firmly defended by our army from beginning to end, and the bandits do not dare to cross the line. Tongchuan and Yaoxian south of Jin Suoguan are also safe and sound. Between Pucheng and Baishui, the bandit army is currently retreating north, and Baishui will soon be recovered. The two sides' positions are intertwined in the Yichuan and Huanglongshan areas of Yijun in the middle, but they are mostly advantageous to us. Those in Huanglongshan are all local bandits, numbering only a few hundred, and it will not be difficult to eliminate them. However, the security teams and local self-defense forces still need to be strengthened to cooperate with the national army in combat. To defend northern Shaanxi, the people's psychology has recently changed. They have heard and seen the Communist Party's perverse actions, and the truth has been revealed. Therefore, the centripetal force of supporting the central government has become stronger after being tested by this war.</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 18th Dispatch] On the day when the National Assembly representatives began to register, the draft order of the National Assembly opening ceremony was also passed by the fourth meeting of the National Assembly Preparatory Committee. The opening ceremony rituals are very simple. The order of the first meeting of the First National Assembly, as approved by the Preparatory Committee, is as follows: (1) Ceremony begins, (2) All stand at attention, (3) Chairman takes his seat, (4) Music plays, (5) National anthem is sung, (6) Three bows to the national flag and the portrait of the Founding Father, (7) Chairman delivers the opening address, (8) Representatives take the oath, (9) Music plays, (10) Ceremony concludes. The original order included a recitation of the Founding Father's testament, but it has been cancelled because it is no longer applicable. It has been decided that Chairman Chiang will serve as the chairman of the National Assembly. In addition, the meeting also resolved three items: (1) Since the opening day of the Assembly coincides with the spring memorial for revolutionary martyrs and fallen soldiers, paying respects to the mausoleum of the Founding Father will be held before the opening ceremony. (2) The state council has approved 90 billion yuan for the assembly's expenses. Approximately 75 billion yuan, for representative hospitality expenses, was drafted according to the cost of living index in December of last year, but it has been more than three months since then, and prices have soared. Therefore, a supplementary estimate of 120.76534 billion yuan for representative hospitality expenses has been drafted and sent to the Government Secretariat for review and approval. (3) Representatives who have not yet prepared their certificate of election for registration should wait until the certificate of election is received before registering.</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 18th] The National Economic Council held its 37th meeting at 3:00 PM on the 18th to specifically discuss the issue of suppressing prices. Chairman Wang Yunwu presided over the discussion of the plans drafted by the six-person price working group, including Chen Qitian, and the calculations of price adjustments for eleven daily necessities using formulas, as proposed by the Secretariat. The plans included controlling resources, promoting production, regulating finance, guiding idle capital, and strengthening price control agencies. The committee members extensively exchanged opinions, and the consensus was that regulating finance should be the most important aspect of suppressing and controlling prices. However, key financial officials Zhang Jia'ao, Yu Hongjun, and Xu Baiyuan were not present at today's meeting, so further study is needed before a concrete plan can be formulated. The committee also exchanged views on the formula for increasing prices of eleven daily necessities proposed by the Secretariat, but because the overall plan for suppressing prices has not yet been concretely decided, it was not finalized. Another meeting will be convened within the next few days for a final decision. At the same time, the opinions of the committee members on prices during the 18th meeting were compiled by Gu Yuquan and reported to Director Zhang for instructions. Furthermore, during the speeches of the committee members on the 18th, criticisms were raised regarding the current foreign exchange policy. Xue Dubi cited an example, stating that the foreign exchange application submitted by the Ministry of Water Resources had been approved four years ago but had not yet been received, indicating that the procedures are too complicated and should be simplified. Chen Qitian also strongly criticized the current foreign exchange policy, saying that it only benefits a few and provides little assistance to international trade.</p>

<h3 id="e28">First Day of National Assembly Representatives' Registration: Ding Xuanxiao First to Sign and Be Filmed <a href="#e28" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c28" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">28</a></h3>
<p>National Assembly representatives began registering on the 18th. Since the State Council approved this congress as the first session (the previous congress was the Constituent National Assembly), the importance of this congress is evident. Although constitutional governance began on December 25th last year, it has been three months now, but the gathering of the constitutional National Assembly is truly the first time.</p>
<p>The National Assembly registration office is located to the right of the National Fire Assembly Hall, which is a newly built building. The offices of several congress groups are squeezed into a row of small rooms, but a large hall is reserved as a lounge. Before the congress opens, this lounge is the registration office. The registration office is well-organized, with signs posted on the walls and pillars indicating where to sign, where to fill out forms, where to collect travel expenses and documents, and where to rest.</p>
<p>If you are a National Assembly representative, when you walk into the registration office, you will be greeted by the signing area. You must present your certificate of election, then leave your name in the signature book, and collect the registration form and accommodation slip. When filling out the accommodation slip, don't forget to indicate where you plan to stay—whether it is your own residence or a guest house or contracted hotel. After filling out the documents and attaching four 2.5-inch headshots, submit them at the counter opposite and collect a copper token, like a token for withdrawing money from a bank. Oh, this should be added: if you don't have photos or forget to bring them? The preparatory committee has prepared them for you, and you can take photos on the spot, using the photography studio's certificate to replace the photos and sending it to the submission area. Then, you can go to the innermost part of the registration office, which is the lounge, and help yourself to some refreshments. When the issuing office announces the number according to the copper token, you can go there to retrieve a document bag. The document bag includes the following miscellaneous items:</p>
<p>(1) A representative badge, (2) a representative handbook, (3) a directory of registered representatives in Beijing, (4) a receipt for the certificate of election, (5) two postcards for representatives to change their communication address in Beijing, (6) a representative accommodation certificate or hotel introduction slip, (7) a representative payment voucher, (8) a copy of the congress traffic management rules, (9) a copy of the congress shuttle bus rules, (10) a congress representative vehicle survey form, (11) a commission for the congress return or travel to various places during the congress to purchase ticket notification form.</p>
<p>With the "Representative Payment Voucher," you can walk back and receive payment at the payment office. Simply sign and stamp the printed receipt, and you will receive 3.6 million yuan for meals and 4.5 million yuan for accommodation (5 million yuan for official expenses will be issued one week after the opening of the congress). If you want to contact transportation, the staff at the transportation liaison office are waiting for you; if you have matters to commission or inquire about, the inquiry office or service office is also waiting for you. In this way, the registration procedures are completed. If it is not crowded, it only takes four minutes from beginning to end.</p>
<p>Just as more than ninety staff members were quietly waiting for the representatives, the first representative came to register, it was Ding Baoxiao, the regional representative from Jurong County, Jiangsu Province. The Central News Agency photographer and some photojournalists, who had been preparing for a long time, wanted to capture the signing of the first person to register, so Representative Ding became the object of "opening the curtain". In order to make a movie, he was "directed" to pose, and the verification, signing, form collection, form filling, document submission, document retrieval, and payment collection were all filmed, inevitably delaying him a bit. At this time, the second representative to register also arrived. This was Jin Zhen, who came from the artillery, the former mayor of Shenyang, and now participating in the National Assembly as a national border ethnic Manchu representative. No one filmed him, so his procedures were completed quickly, he received the document bag, and obtained the number one badge. When Representative Ding finished filming with a smiling face, he realized that the number one badge had been taken by Mr. Jin. This inevitably caused a small negotiation, he was the first person to register and should receive the number one badge, but the artillery lieutenant general (Jin Zhen) said well: "You have already been on camera, so leave the number one badge to me."</p>
<p>The representatives came sporadically, and the number was not large. The congress staff had nothing to do, and some staff members were using refreshments in the lounge. The refreshments were catered by the Peacock Restaurant of the Central Hotel, and the representatives could take them at will without paying.</p>
<p>Several representatives came without their certificates of election. After inquiring, they could not register, so they had to leave and wait to receive their certificates of election before coming again. In one morning, only seven representatives registered, and the staff exclaimed: "Business is slow." The registration time is from 8:30 AM to 12:00 PM and from 2:00 PM to 6:00 PM. More people registered in the afternoon, but the total number for the day was only seventeen. It is said that this is because many people did not know that registration started today, and many people have not yet received their certificates of election. It is estimated that there will be more than 2,700 representatives attending this meeting, and most of them will register at the same time in the few days before the opening, which will be a tense and chaotic scene in the future.</p>
<p>Sun Ke, Mo Dexian, Xu Chuanlin, Liu Dongyan, and Secretary-General Hong Lanyou, who are responsible for preparing for the congress, visited the registration office at 9:30 AM. Besides Hong Lanyou, there was exactly one person each from the Kuomintang, the Democratic Socialist Party, the Youth Party, and social elites. Photojournalists rushed to take photos of them. Sun Ke and others went around the venue, looked at the various arrangements and the staff's work, and nodded repeatedly, expressing their satisfaction.</p>
<p>The work of representative registration has begun. This work will continue until the opening of the congress, and many people are asking: "When will Chairman Chiang come to register?" (Sent from Nanjing on March 18th)</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3 id="e29">After President Truman's Two Speeches <a href="#e29" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c29" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">29</a></h3>
<p>US President Truman's speech to a joint session of both houses of Congress the day before yesterday is undoubtedly the most important historical document since the end of World War II. From now on, we will have to see how the American people and all countries that love democracy and peace react to President Truman's speech.</p>
<p>In the past half month, the situation in Europe has taken a sharp turn for the worse, almost reaching the final stage of the "Cold War," causing US President Truman, standing on the other side of the Atlantic, to begin to show that his confidence in world peace was wavering. However, the United States after World War II bears a special responsibility in terms of morality and history for maintaining world peace, and its words and actions are related to the safety of the world. Therefore, the people of the whole world, especially those who are threatened by the communist forces, are looking forward to the movements in Washington. At the same time, President Truman himself is deeply aware of the current global crisis and the great responsibility of the United States, and is eager to awaken the vigilance of the American government and the public. Therefore, a few days ago, he decided to deliver a speech to a joint session of both houses of Congress, clarifying the world situation and requesting Congress to take necessary steps to save the situation before it is too late. This diplomatic speech is not only valued by the American government and the public, but also by the people of all countries in the world; in the moment before President Truman delivered his speech, the people of the whole world were probably holding their breath and listening to President Truman's roar.</p>
<p>Now, we have finally heard President Truman's speech on the radio, and at the same time read the full text of this important speech in the telegram. The main points of the speech are summarized as follows: (1) The survival of democracy has been threatened, and it is time for the free men and women of the world to bravely confront the threats to their freedom. (2) The United States must maintain its strong strength to support European countries that are still free and feel threatened by communism and the rule of police states. (3) We must be prepared to pay the price of peace, otherwise we will inevitably pay the price of war. (4) He called for the temporary restoration of the draft and the implementation of universal military training to cope with the serious situation caused by the continuous aggression of the Soviet Union. (5) He requested that Congress act quickly on the $5.3 billion European recovery plan. (6) Our ability to quickly assemble and train a large number of well-trained troops in times of crisis can prevent future conflicts from occurring, and other national policies can restore world stability. (7) Implementing universal military training is enough to declare to the world that we are a support for peace, not only with great determination, but also with the power to achieve peace. (8) We should, regardless of party affiliation, organize a united front and unite with all countries in the world to make every possible effort to maintain world peace.</p>
<p>President Truman's speech was drafted by the President himself in consultation with political, diplomatic, military, and economic experts, and every sentence has a purpose and every word has weight, but because the speech time was only twenty minutes, it could not be explained in detail. However, after President Truman attended the joint session of Congress, he immediately flew to New York to attend the St. Peter's Dinner and gave a speech, more frankly criticizing the Soviet Union's attempt to establish authoritarian rule in the still free countries of Western Europe, and pointed out that communism denies God and does not recognize the right of mankind to self-government, and is in fact a tyranny. He also said that the existence of democracy is currently threatened by communism, and the United States has become the only protector of the free world. At this time, we should unite our strength with the strength of other free people to fight against communism. Therefore, we should use military, economic, and moral strength to support these countries. Although the contents of the two speeches are different, in our opinion, the latter is more powerful and more frank than the former. However, if President Truman only roars and condemns the Soviet Union's aggression and criticizes the communist threat to freedom verbally, and the United States still cannot immediately take effective actions in all aspects to stop the flood of communist forces, then we cannot be sure whether the world's chaos can be immediately reversed.</p>
<p>Looking at Europe in the past half month, the situation is crystallizing. On the one hand, there was first the coup in Czechoslovakia. After the Czech communists seized power, the tragedy of democracy has been repeated. Later, the Soviet Union forced Finland to conclude a mutual assistance treaty. Although it is still in the negotiation stage, Finland, forced by the general trend, is afraid that it will only obey orders. Recently, Europe has been filled with alarming rumors, either that the Soviet Union will take action against Turkey, or that the Soviet Union will require the Nordic countries of Norway and Sweden to sign alliances. The upcoming general election in Italy and the activities of the Communist Party are even more shocking. On the other hand, diplomatic activities are also quite lively. The London Conference decided to merge the three occupied areas of West Germany, and the Bejing Five-Nation Conference has also completed the drafting of the Western European Five-Nation Alliance Treaty, which was signed and established in Paris yesterday, and there is a possibility of expansion. In addition, the European Sixteen-Nation Conference is also being held in Paris. Regardless of the attitude of the representatives of various countries or the course of the meeting, it is enough to show that the countries of Western Europe are united in good faith, unanimously dealing with the threat of communism. Although the United States did not directly participate, the United States is in fact the "guardian" of democratic and free countries, which is an undeniable fact. After reading President Truman's speech, we can especially believe that the US aid policy to Europe will gradually evolve from economic aid to military aid. From this point of view, in addition to the unity of Western European countries themselves, coupled with the full support of the United States, it is logically hoped that the European situation will gradually become clear. However, why hasn't President Truman's speech stabilized the hearts of the world? We believe there are at least two reasons;</p>
<p>First, today's bipolarization of Europe is even more serious than the situation after the Munich Conference in 1938. The aggressor in the past was Nazi Germany. Although Hitler owned Austria and part of Czechoslovakia at that time, the nine countries in Eastern Europe had allied relations with Britain and France. In addition, France was the most powerful country in Europe at that time, and further east, there was a third force - the Soviet Union - restraining it. Looking back at today's Europe, because totalitarian communist countries are always taking the lead, and democratic countries are lagging behind in everything, these two major groups have almost reached a point where their strengths are evenly matched and cannot be compared, both in terms of population and area. Moreover, from the point of view of geographical location or military strategy, the Eastern European group has an advantage, which seems to be beyond the reach of the Western European group. Therefore, the establishment of the Western European Alliance is important today. The five countries of Western Europe not only need to help each other to stop the Soviet Union's military aggression, but also need to work together to prevent the activities of the fifth column within the country. However, according to official observations, its role may not be as great as the world imagines, and looking forward to its future, it is full of thorns, and it is unlikely to be smooth sailing, so we cannot be too optimistic.</p>
<p>Second, although President Truman has frankly expressed his anti-communist stance and frankly announced his support for democratic and free countries, his focus is still on Europe. In particular, General Marshall is still clinging to his belief that "Europe is more important than Asia" and openly stated that he is unwilling to engage in a "cold war" on two fronts, as if the Asian Chinese side is not worthy of attention. This is where a major crisis is lurking. Our newspaper's editorial will again point out the national nature of communism, which cannot be divided into important and unimportant. The Soviet Union is currently expanding its power simultaneously in Europe and Asia. If the US authorities only know one and not the other, only know the crisis in Europe and not the seriousness of the situation in Asia, then no matter what steps the United States takes, it may not be enough to stop the expansion of communist forces. It must be known that if China falls into the hands of communist rulers, with the entire red China supporting the communist camp, the map of all of Asia will change color, and the United States on the other side of the Pacific may not be able to sleep soundly. Therefore, President Truman's two speeches did not mention China, which is on the front line of anti-communism, and we really cannot help but express our regrets. We would like to reiterate to the American government and the public that the policy of Europe first and Asia later will indeed lead to irreparable disasters. If we do not quickly change course, we will inevitably repeat the mistakes and make a historical mistake!</p>

<h3 id="e31">27 of Our Ancient Paintings Returned by the Japanese Government Yesterday, All Treasures of Zhang Xueliang <a href="#e31" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c31" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">31</a></h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 18th] Twenty-seven famous Chinese silk paintings of the Ming and Qing dynasties (totaling fifty-six) looted by Japan were returned to our country on the morning of the 18th. It is said that these are the most precious ancient books that can be found in the country, and were given by Zhang Xueliang to the Shenyang Museum before the Shenyang Incident. After the incident, they were looted by the Japanese and sent to Japan in 1943, re-mounted. They were originally scheduled to be returned to Shenyang after being re-mounted, but due to the sudden end of the war, they were preserved in the Imperial Museum of the National Tokyo Museum. Wu Bannong, head of the Compensation and Return Group of our country's delegation to Japan, said: It is not yet known whether each painting will be returned to Zhang. It is believed that because they are precious and rare, each painting should be regarded as state-owned property. Among the twenty-seven paintings, six are Ming paintings and twenty-one are works from the Qianlong period of the Qing Dynasty, including ink treasures of Zhu Zhishan and Emperor Qianlong. Each painting has bright colors and is mostly of flowers and signed divine images. The marks on the paintings indicate that they were purchased by Zhang Zuolin and Zhang Xueliang from Zhu Qiling, who was the Prime Minister under Yuan Shikai. The paintings will be exhibited at the delegation on March 23 with jade screens, jade vases, etc. recently returned by Japan. Journalists from the Allied countries here have been invited to visit. The date of transporting the paintings back to China has not yet been determined.</p>

<p>[Central News Agency, Kunming, 18th] The China National Aviation Corporation flight from Shanghai to Kunming on the 16th, after being forced to land in Zhan Yi that night, had eight male passengers and twenty women and children. Yesterday, a special plane dispatched by the company's Kunming station flew to Zhan Yi to transfer them to Kunming. The plane that was forced to land also flew to Kunming at the same time. According to the passengers, the plane left Shanghai on the morning of the 16th, originally scheduled to fly to Kunming via Hankou and Liuzhou. When they learned that the weather in Liuzhou was bad, they changed their route to fly directly from Hankou. At about 5:00 PM, when they flew over the mountains and valleys of the Yunnan border, the right engine suddenly failed, and they encountered a strong wind and rain. They managed to fly for half an hour, but the fuselage lost its balance, so they threw away dozens of packages of mail and luggage, and continued to fly to Zhan Yi and landed. The situation at the time was extremely critical, but the passengers and crew members were very calm, so they were able to land safely and congratulate each other on their rebirth.</p>

<h3 id="e39">Improvement Planned for Taiwan's Water Conservancy <a href="#e39" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c39" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">39</a></h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Office, 18th dispatch] Shen Baixian, along with Shi Chengxi, an inspector from the Ministry, and He Zhenxing, a technician, and nine others, left Nanjing on the 25th of last month to inspect water conservancy in Taiwan. After spending more than half a month there, they returned to Nanjing on the 18th. Speaking to reporters, Mr. Shen shared his impressions from the inspection, stating: “Since Taiwan came under Japanese rule, they implemented colonial policies, exploiting everything like raising chickens for eggs. They vigorously developed irrigation canals and hydroelectric projects and organized local water conservancy groups to assist in their development. Statistics show that the area of irrigated farmland reached over 530,000 hectares, and the length of flood-control embankments exceeded 400,000 meters. However, in the two years leading up to the victory [end of WWII], Japan, struggling to cope, saw all water conservancy facilities damaged by the excavation of defensive fortifications. By the eve of restoration [of Taiwan to China], the area of farmland lacking irrigation reached approximately 200,000 hectares, and around 40,000 meters of embankments were damaged. After the restoration, with the cooperation of water conservancy personnel from the provincial government and water conservancy groups from various counties, over 20,000 meters of embankments have been repaired, and most of the farmland lacking irrigation has been restored.” Mr. Shen also discussed Taiwan’s water conservancy work plan for the current year, which includes plans to repair over 20,000 meters of embankments before the flood season and to strengthen farmland irrigation projects, etc. The total project costs are estimated at over 4.5 billion Taiwan dollars from the provincial treasury and 1.5 billion Taiwan dollars raised locally. He added that the basic-level staff of Taiwan’s water conservancy organizations are lacking in expertise. During the Japanese occupation, the Japanese only provided Taiwanese with some engineering education and work experience, while Japanese personnel filled the senior technical and management positions. This shortcoming should be improved. In the future, the province’s water conservancy efforts should focus on the entire river basin to achieve comprehensive control.</p>

<h3 id="e41">Slow Progress in Returning Plundered Materials from Japan <a href="#e41" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c41" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">41</a></h3>
<p>My Suggestions Being Considered to Expedite Progress</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 18th dispatch] Wu Ban-chen, chairman of our country’s Repatriation and Restitution Committee in Japan, told reporters that the Far Eastern Commission is currently studying our country’s suggestion to adopt a "lenient" restitution policy to facilitate the return of materials. Wu believes that the main reason for the slow progress of the restitution work is the various restrictions imposed by the Far Eastern Commission. The Commission places too much emphasis on evidence, making it impossible for our Commission to claim compensation for a large number of losses where evidence is lacking. For example, during the war, Japan plundered 200 motor vehicles from our country, but due to lack of evidence, we can now only claim the return of four vehicles. It is not surprising that documents are insufficient or missing, as documents that could serve as evidence were partially or completely lost during the war. The second obstacle to the restitution work is the lack of direct contact between the Commission and the Japanese government. Otherwise, the Commission could obtain more clues about the plundered items. Over the past year, the Commission has worked hard, but due to the above reasons, the results obtained are far from what was expected. The Commission's achievements in the past include: the entire equipment of the Yongli Chemical Company, the largest nitric acid manufacturer in our country, with a capacity of 1,500 cubic tons, which was taken from Nanjing to Japan, will soon be shipped back on the Hai'e [Seagull] wheel [ship] sailing to Japan. In addition, some iron statues and iron bells plundered from our country's temples will also be transported back to our country on the same ship. The Guangzhou Paper Mill, which was also completely moved to Hokkaido by Japan, will soon be dismantled and returned. The machinery of the Tianjin Sanjia Ban [Plywood] Company and the Shanghai Parker Davis Factory will also be returned, and the latter will be handed over to the United States. The Commission recently negotiated for the return of some machinery from the South China Iron and Steel Company, which was organized by Zeng Yangfu to manufacture automobiles. Of the 3,000 pieces of machinery from the Northwest Industrial Company, organized by Yan Xishan, that were shipped to Japan, 1,000 pieces have been found and will soon be transported back. Other returned items include four ships, four motor vehicles, 35,000 rare books, and 95,000 ordinary books. Two other warships may also be returned to our country recently.</p>

<h3 id="e55">Burma Since Independence <a href="#e55" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c55" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">55</a></h3>
<p>— Our Reporter Yuan Wenzhong</p>
<p>On January 4, 1948, the Blue Sky White Sun banner flew high over the land of Burma. The Union of Burma, with an area of over 260,000 square miles and a population of over 14 million, was thus freed from the 61-year rule of the British Empire, beginning her new life of independence and autonomy.</p>
<p>Independence Ceremony</p>
<p>On March 11th, Lord Mountbatten and his wife flew from Calcutta to Rangoon. On the 12th, they presided over the ceremony of returning the Burmese throne, completing the final ritual of Burmese independence. The press corps took the first flight of the China National Aviation Corporation (CNAC) between China and Burma to visit Burma, and it coincided with this event, so we were able to participate in this most precious and exciting moment in Burmese history. The Burmese throne was built in 1875 by King Mindon in Mandalay. It is 30 feet and 10 inches high, gilded, and shaped much like a Chinese paifang. There are steps at the back to go up. In 1885, the British captured Mandalay, and the Burmese king was exiled to Bombay. In 1902, Lord Curzon dismantled the throne, packed it into 36 boxes, and transported it to India, where it was displayed in the Indian Museum until now. After Burma became independent, the throne was shipped back to Rangoon from India in 60 sections on February 6th and reassembled in the hall of what used to be the Governor's Office and is now the Presidential Palace. The ceremony presided over by Mountbatten took place in this city hall. On that day, there were hundreds of people including foreign envoys, guests, and Burmese commissioners participating. The ceremony was very simple, with only Mountbatten and the Burmese President each reading a moving speech. The curtain covering the seats of honor was unveiled by Mountbatten, and at the same time the Burmese national anthem was played, thus the form of Burmese independence was successfully completed. Although Mountbatten was still so handsome, he seemed to carry a tired and indifferent expression throughout the ceremony. It is not difficult for people to understand how this lord, who was performing the task of removing a jewel from the British Empire's crown, felt.</p>
<p>Britain Holds the Trump Card</p>
<p>Thus, Britain officially withdrew from the political stage in Burma, but in military and economic terms, she still holds the invincible trump card. The Anglo-Burmese Defense Agreement signed on August 29, 1947, stipulated that British troops should withdraw as soon as possible and that all military equipment should be transferred to the Burmese government. In addition, both sides agreed that Britain should send a military advisory group of the navy, army, and air force to train the Burmese army. The Burmese government must not accept military advisors from other countries other than Britain. "Both sides'" naval vessels may enter each other's territory with notification, and "both sides'" air force planes may fly over each other's territory with notification. "Both sides'" armies may also enter each other's territory when necessary. This agreement is provisionally valid for three years. In other words, British military power in Burma can be controlled for at least three years. Economically, Burma's largest industries and businesses are still firmly in the hands of the British. Several large companies, such as the Burma Oil Company, the Irrawaddy Flotilla Company, and Steel Brothers &amp; Co., control Burma's industry, shipping, and commerce. Their deep-rooted power cannot be shaken in a short period of time.</p>
<p>Government Personnel</p>
<p>Even so, Burma is finally independent. The current Burmese government claims to be an anti-fascist, left-leaning government. It was originally composed of three political parties: the Socialist Party, the People's Volunteer Organization, and the Communist Party, and was named the Anti-Fascist People's Freedom League (AFPFL). However, after coming to power, the Communist Party withdrew due to disagreements over its political program and split into the Red Flag Communist Party and the White Flag Communist Party. The Red Flag is the most leftist radical party and has now been declared an illegal party by the government. The White Flag is more moderate, but it also refuses to cooperate with the government. In addition, the right-wing opposition parties include the Dobama Asiayone, the Patriotic Party, and the People's Party. In last year's world-shaking Burmese coup, Aung San, chairman of the AFPFL, was assassinated by U Saw, leader of the Patriotic Party. U Saw was recently sentenced to death by the court. Prime Minister Thakin Nu, the vice-chairman of the AFPFL, holds the actual power.</p>
<p>Clarifying Policies</p>
<p>Regarding the current government's policies, Thakin Nu elaborated in detail at the Constituent Assembly. He said: "Why should Burma go to the left? Because Burma's wealth is completely concentrated in the hands of the first British, second Indian, and third Chinese capitalists. The Burmese common people live in the lowest level of poverty, gnawing on the bones left by others. This kind of unfair situation must be eliminated, but its meaning is not to create a small number of Burmese capitalists to replace the British, Indian, and Chinese capitalists, while the majority of the people remain poor and suffering. Therefore, the government's policy is to establish a system that benefits all the people, so that all the people can enjoy its benefits. This policy is not radical, and it cannot be successful overnight. This policy is not completely Soviet-style either, because Burma's geographical environment is not as close to the Soviet Union as Czechoslovakia or Bulgaria. The most important task of the Burmese government today is to do its utmost to make the country strong. Only when the country is stronger can we move further forward!"</p>
<p>Economic Status Quo</p>
<p>Indeed, until now, Burma's wealth is completely in the hands of the British, Indians, and Chinese. The British are far above, while the Indians and Overseas Chinese hold the middle and lower levels of industry and commerce. In the downtown area of Rangoon, it is simply the world of the British, Indians, and Overseas Chinese. It is rare to see shops opened by Burmese people. The Burmese government is now striving to move towards national economic socialism. It announced a real estate law prohibiting the sale or mortgage of real estate in Burma to foreigners, but this only affects the Overseas Chinese, while British and Indian residents can still be an exception. It also controls import and export trade, stipulating that 50 percent of the quota should be given to Burmese merchants, but because the Burmese merchants themselves do not have this ability, they either transfer the license or cooperate with foreigners, so the results are still obtained by foreign merchants. It also wants to nationalize the mining industry, but because of financial difficulties, it cannot afford to pay the purchase price, so it is unlikely to be realized in the near future.

<h3 id="e56">Marshall Emphasizes the Need to Strengthen Military Strength, Urges Congress to Make Decisions and Take Action, Military Leaders Also Attend Senate to Testify <a href="#e56" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c56" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">56</a></h3>
<p>[Our Report] New York, 18th Broadcast: Washington News, Secretary of Defense Forrestal and Secretary of the Army Royal presented their views to the Senate Armed Services Committee today, advocating for an increase in the currently stipulated military strength and strongly supporting President Truman's proposed implementation of universal conscription and temporary restoration of [the] draft. Mr. Chen [Forrestal] stated that the current stipulated military strength is based on assumptions made two years ago, which have not been realized. He did not provide exact figures but said that definite recommendations could only be made after detailed research. Mr. Forrestal stated that the stipulated strength of the Army is 669,000, but there are only 560,000 people currently serving; the stipulated strength of the Navy is 664,000, and only 474,000 are currently serving; the stipulated strength of the Air Force is 471,000, and only 362,000 are currently serving. These figures show that the current shortage is 400,800 people. However, Mr. Forrestal previously estimated the shortage to be 350,000 people. Congressional Republican leaders remain lukewarm to universal conscription, but they are not overly opposed to implementing a new draft. Mr. Forrestal strongly argued that we must not hold the view that the existence of atomic bombs means that a large number of personnel are no longer needed.</p>
<p>[US Information Service, Washington, 17th dispatch] After President Truman requested Congress today to re-establish conscription and formulate universal conscription, Secretary of State Marshall issued a statement urging Congress to take decisive action to show "America's determination to maintain a strong strength to maintain peace and freedom in the European world." Secretary Marshall made this statement to the Senate Military Committee. The Committee began public discussions today on the issue of universal conscription and on the President's request to restore the draft and increase the strength of the national armed forces to an appropriate level. The universal conscription bill has been successfully reported in the House Military Committee, but the House Rules Committee has not yet presented the bill on the floor.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Washington, 17th dispatch] Secretary of State Marshall testified before the Senate Military Committee today that without military strength, diplomatic actions in the current world situation can only lead to appeasement. The Committee should discuss the National Youth Military Training Act and the Temporary Conscription Act, and the US Air Force expansion program also needs to be considered. Mr. Marshall said that the temporary Conscription Act is the only way to quickly replenish the troops to full strength. In the case of Korea, the garrison commander requested an increase in troops to 38,000, but the Army Department only sent 30,000, and even that number could not be fully deployed due to personnel shortages. On February 8 of this year, there were a total of 18,000 troops stationed in Korea, and recent reports show that there are only 15,000 troops, and this garrison is still shrinking. Mr. Marshall also said that the Italian elections on the 18th of this month are far more important than local events in that country. This move will not only determine whether Italy can restore true democracy but will also foreshadow a trend of division, which may extend to the shores of the Atlantic.</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 17th dispatch] The US Army Department revealed on the 17th that it is drafting a plan to restore the Selective Service System based on President Truman's request to Congress to approve a temporary conscription system to help curb the spread of the Soviet Union.</p>

<p>[United Press International, London, 18th] Western European nations unanimously praised President Truman's message as a "New Monroe Doctrine," providing a basis for the European Recovery Program. The number of people listening to the message, from the Arctic Ocean to Africa, broke all previous records, and its acclaim was unprecedented since the war. Moscow Radio, exceptionally, broadcast Truman's message to the entire Soviet population in the early morning.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper Report] London, 18th Broadcast: Moscow claims that President Truman deliberately created a crisis in his speech yesterday to serve his party's interests.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 17th] Diplomatic circles here feel that President Truman's call for Congress to reinstate conscription, implement universal military training, and quickly pass the aid to Europe bill implies a military guarantee for the five-nation Western European Union treaty. The consolidation of the global anti-communist front has achieved unprecedented success in the past 24 hours. Following the agreement by sixteen European nations in Paris yesterday to establish a permanent economic cooperation organization, the UK, France, Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg formed a military mutual assistance pact in Brussels today. Ninety minutes later, President Truman in Washington frankly expressed his willingness to provide Western European countries with any needed military assistance. This series of significant actions occurring within a short 24 hours is truly rare in history.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Paris, 17th] President Truman's speech to Congress has made a profound and significant impression on French officials and the public. While it was generally expected that Truman would make a strong statement, few anticipated such specific recommendations and such blatant warnings to the Soviet Union. It is also believed here that Truman's support for the Western European five-nation pact is tantamount to declaring that in the event of the circumstances described in the five-nation pact, and the five nations engage in self-defense, the United States will participate in military intervention. The US President's particular emphasis on affirmative and proactive action, rather than just verbal intimidation of the Soviet Union, is especially welcomed by responsible officials here.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, London, 17th] Western Europe unanimously expressed admiration for Truman's declaration tonight. In Rome, government officials believe that Truman's speech is highly relevant to Italy. In The Hague, the Dutch Foreign Ministry considers it a great encouragement to Western Europe.</p>

<p>[Reuters, Washington, 17th] A senior US official told our agency that Truman's decision to request the reinstatement of conscription was significantly influenced by British Foreign Secretary Bevin. After Bevin informed Marshall that verbal protests alone were insufficient to halt communist expansion and would only demonstrate the West's impotence, US Ambassador to the Soviet Union Smith was the first to propose the reinstatement of conscription. Senator Vandenberg, Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, stated, "Truman's speech is a speech for peace. If domestic communists attempt to rely on foreign support to undermine domestic unity, the speech will become a speech for war." Republican Senator Taft stated, "Truman has made clear his and our unified determination to prevent the expansion of communism as much as possible." Representative Eaton, Chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, stated that he would do everything possible to meet Truman's request for the swift passage of the European Recovery Program. Meanwhile, the Senate Armed Services Committee announced that it would begin reviewing the conscription and universal military training requests immediately, with Secretary of State Marshall being the first to testify.</p>

<p>[Associated Press, London, 17th] The new treaty of alliance signed by the UK and Transjordan in Amman last Monday was announced here today, stipulating that if one of the signatory countries is at war or faces a threat of war, it may request the other party to send troops to assist. The UK may establish two air force bases in Transjordan and may train troops. The UK and Transjordan shall form a joint defense committee to determine the location of British troops stationed there. The UK agrees to supply Transjordan with military equipment, arms, aircraft, and other materials, and agrees to provide financial assistance to the King of Transjordan. The UK agrees to send officers to train the Transjordanian army. The treaty is valid for twenty years.</p>

<p>Chilean Representative Invited to Attend and Present Arguments</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Lake Success, 17th] The Security Council, disregarding the strong opposition from the Soviet Union and Ukraine, began discussing the case in which the former Czech representative accused the Soviet Union of manipulating the Czech coup. The Security Council voted nine to two to include in the Council's agenda the accusation that the Soviet Union manipulated the Czech coup, which was initially proposed by former Czech representative Papánek and formally supported by the Chilean government. The Security Council also voted nine to two (with the Soviet Union and Ukraine voting against) to invite the Chilean representative to attend the meeting and state their recommendations.</p>
<p>The Security Council decided today, after nearly two hours of debate in an unprecedented atmosphere of tension, to consider this highly explosive Czech issue. The public gallery of the Security Council was packed today, and emotions ran high during the proceedings. The Chairman of the Security Council, our representative Jiang Tingfu, repeatedly tried to suppress cheers and applause.</p>

<p>[Associated Press, Washington, 17th] The House Foreign Affairs Committee today, in a closed-door meeting, approved the $5.3 billion Aid to Europe Bill, stipulating that $1 billion of this amount will be loaned by the Export-Import Bank. In other words, Congress only needs to directly allocate $4.3 billion. The total amount of this bill is the same as that passed by the Senate, and it is for one year. Committee Chairman Eaton told reporters afterward that other foreign aid bills would be decided on later, including the $570 million economic aid to China bill and the $275 million second military aid bill to Greece and Turkey.</p>
<p>[United Press International, Washington, 17th] The House plans to include aid to China and aid to Greece and Turkey in this bill. This comprehensive bill is expected to be debated in the House on the 23rd, and a final decision may be made at the end of March or the beginning of April.</p>

<p>[Associated Press, Seoul, 18th] UN Representative to Korea, Indian representative Menon, stated in a radio address today that the mission will oversee the Korean parliamentary elections on May 9, and then assist the parliament in organizing the South Korean government. It is hoped that North and South Korea will be unified in the future.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Washington, 17th] The US-occupied zone in southern Korea is scheduled to hold elections on May 9. This is another step in the US effort to promote Korean independence and strengthen democracy in the Far East. According to a certain US diplomatic official, "We do not imagine that this move will solve all the current problems in Korea. The upcoming vote is experimental in nature and far from the universal election we imagine." The future Korean government will have a president, prime minister, cabinet, and other official positions, all of which will be elected by parliament. It is expected here that Korean right-wing leader Syngman Rhee will serve as speaker. It is said that Rhee is eager to become the president of the Korean Republic, but if North Korea does not participate, the future of the Republican government remains uncertain.</p>

<p>[Associated Press, New York, 17th] Today is the Irish patron saint St. Patrick's Day. After announcing his policy in Congress, President Truman flew here, accompanied by New York Governor Dewey, to review the traditional Irish flower parade. He delivered a speech at the commemorative banquet in the evening.</p>
<p>[United Press International, New York, 18th] President Truman this evening changed his original text and delivered a political speech, discussing America's preparedness and diplomacy. He stated frankly that under no circumstances would he accept political assistance from "Wallace and certain communists." He stated, "If participating with them or letting them cooperate with me is the price of victory, then I would rather fail." (Truman has announced that he will run for re-election as president). Truman's words were met with thunderous applause from the audience. Truman strongly criticized the "vain hope that peace can be obtained by shouting for peace" and the erroneous notion that "everything is fine in the world." The original text of Truman's speech stated that he had requested Congress that morning to temporarily reinstate conscription laws so that America's military strength would be sufficient to be the "main protector of the free world." Truman's tenure as president has been a time of many troubles, and this criticism of Wallace has brought matters to a climax. Wallace has been highly critical of Truman's foreign policy, and he sent a telegram to congressional leaders on the 17th stating that the government was inciting "war hysteria." Wallace is scheduled to broadcast on Thursday evening to respond to Truman's congressional message, and is sure to respond to Truman's statement about "communists." Truman and his party boarded a special train on the evening of the 17th and are expected to return to Washington on Thursday morning.</p>

It is an alliance formed by like-minded neighboring countries seeking closer social and spiritual unity.

<h3 id="e70">Full Text of Truman's Speech <a href="#e70" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c70" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">70</a></h3>
<p>[From the United States News Agency, Washington, 17th] The full text of Truman's speech is as follows: "I am here today to report to you on the seriousness of the situation in Europe and to suggest actions for your consideration: Europe is undergoing rapid changes, which will affect our foreign policy and our national security. For those nations striving to maintain a form of government that grants freedom to the people, there is now an increasing threat. The United States is deeply concerned about the preservation of these nations' freedom. To maintain the conditions under which we can achieve a lasting peace based on freedom and justice, we must take action now. Achieving this peace has always been the great goal of our country.</p>
<p>Almost three years have passed since the end of the greatest war in history, yet peace and stability have not returned to the world. We know that the end of the war does not automatically solve the problems it caused. Building peace after a war has always been a difficult task. Even if all the Allied nations in World War II shared a common desire to build a just and honorable peace, there were still enormous difficulties in reaching this goal.</p>
<p>But today's world situation is not primarily the result of the natural difficulties that arise after a war. It is mainly due to one nation that has not only refused to cooperate in establishing a just and honorable peace but—worse—has actively worked to prevent it.</p>
<p>Congress is very familiar with the progress of the situation.</p>
<p>You know that democratic countries have sincerely and patiently attempted to find a solid foundation for peace through negotiations and agreements. Conferences have been held time and again in different parts of the world. We have tried to resolve the problems caused by the war on a basis that would allow a fair peace to be established. You know the difficulties we have encountered, but the past record stands like a monument, upright, proving the loyalty and integrity of the world's democracies. The agreements we have reached, though not perfect, can provide a basis for a fair peace—provided that these agreements are observed.</p>
<p>But the agreements have not been observed.</p>
<p>These agreements have been repeatedly scorned and violated by one nation.</p>
<p>Congress is also very familiar with the development of the United Nations. The majority of the world's nations have united within the United Nations, striving to establish a world order based on law rather than force. The majority of nations warmly and sincerely support the United Nations and are working to make it stronger and more effective.</p>
<p>But one nation has repeatedly abused the veto power, obstructing the work of the United Nations. In the period of two years and some months, this nation has vetoed twenty-one proposed actions.</p>
<p>But that is not enough. Since the end of the war, the Soviet Union and its agents have destroyed the independence and democratic character of a series of countries in Eastern and Central Europe.</p>
<p>It is this brutal action and the apparent attempt to extend this action to the remaining free nations of Europe that have created today's crisis in Europe.</p>
<p>The fall of the Czech Republic has shocked the entire civilized world. Pressure is now being applied to Finland, making the Scandinavian Peninsula precarious. Greece is under direct military attack by traitors, who are actively supported by communist-controlled neighboring countries. In Italy, a communist minority is desperately trying to control the country. Although the methods used vary, the pattern is very clear.</p>
<p>Amid this growing threat, there are now encouraging signs that the free nations of Europe are becoming more united for their economic well-being and the common defense of their freedom.</p>
<p>In the economic sphere, mutual aid efforts are underway to restore the conditions necessary to preserve free institutions. In Paris, the sixteen nations cooperating in the European Recovery Program are now meeting again, establishing a joint organization to work for the economic recovery of Western Europe.</p>
<p>The United States firmly supports these nations' efforts to repair the damage caused by the war and restore a healthy world economy. When I presented this plan to Congress last December, I emphasized the need for prompt action. Since that day, everything in Europe has clearly indicated the extreme urgency of taking such steps.</p>
<p>The Soviet Union and its satellite countries were invited to participate in the European Recovery Program. They refused this invitation. Moreover, they declared their fierce hostility to the program and attempted to undermine it with an aggressive posture. They see in this plan a major obstacle to achieving their attempt to subdue the free societies of Europe. They do not even want the sixteen cooperating nations to practice self-help.</p>
<p>The economic recovery of Europe is essential, but economic reconstruction measures alone are not enough. The free nations of Europe understand that if economic recovery is to succeed, some means of protection must be provided against domestic and foreign aggression. As the threats to their freedom have increased, a movement for collective self-defense has accompanied the movement for economic cooperation.</p>
<p>At this very moment as I speak to you, five nations of the free societies of Europe are signing a fifty-year agreement in Brussels for economic cooperation and joint defense against aggression.</p>
<p>This action is of great importance because this agreement was not imposed by a more powerful neighbor. It represents the choice of independent governments representing the will of the people and is being undertaken in accordance with the provisions stipulated in the Charter of the United Nations.</p>
<p>Its significance far outweighs the actual provisions of the agreement itself. It is an important step on Europe's path to unity in order to defend and preserve its civilization. This development deserves our full support. I believe that the United States will extend its support to free nations in appropriate ways as the situation requires. I believe that the determination of the free nations of Europe to protect themselves will be matched by our own determination to help them do so.</p>
<p>Recent developments in Europe have made us aware of many basic questions of great importance.</p>
<p>I believe we have reached the point where the position of the United States must be stated without error.</p>
<p>The principles and goals in the United Nations Charter still represent our hope for establishing law in international relations. This charter constitutes the international ethic. The basic form of discipline, and this international ethic is what our country believes in. But we cannot ignore the cruel fact that, due to the obstruction and even contempt of one country, this great dream has not yet been fully realized.</p>
<p>Therefore, we must take other measures to supplement the work of the United Nations and support its goals. In the history of the world, sometimes action is wiser than hesitation. Action, of course, contains certain risks, but the risk of inaction is greater. Because if we act wisely now, we will strengthen the United Nations and the forces of freedom, justice, and peace represented by all the free nations of the world.</p>
<p>Therefore, I consider it my responsibility to make recommendations to Congress, which, in my judgment, are best suited to support all free and democratic nations in Europe and improve the foundation of our own national strength.</p>
<p>First, I suggest that Congress swiftly complete its action on the European Recovery Program. This program is the foundation of our policy of aid to Europe. Its rapid passage is the most effective contribution we can make to peace.</p>
<p>The Senate's resolute action, regardless of political issues, is a remarkable example of the effective work of democracy.</p>
<p>Time is of great importance now. I am very excited to hear the news that the House plans to take swift action. I hope not a day will be wasted. Second, I suggest the swift enactment of legislation for universal military training.</p>
<p>Until the free nations of Europe regain their strength, and as long as the threat of communism to the survival of democracy persists, the United States must maintain sufficient strength to support those European nations threatened by communist control and police state rule.</p>
<p>I believe we have learned the importance of maintaining military strength to prevent war. We have discovered that if we want to maintain peace in peacetime, a sound military system is necessary. In the past, aggressors, seeing our apparent lack of military power, have unwisely precipitated wars. Although they were ultimately destroyed by misunderstanding our strength, we have paid a terrible price for being unprepared.</p>
<p>Universal military training is the only acceptable way to build up the civilian personnel of our armed forces to a level sufficient to meet emergencies. Our ability to mobilize a large number of trained personnel in times of emergency can prevent future conflicts, and this ability, combined with other measures of national policy, can restore stability to the world.</p>
<p>The United States' adoption of universal military training at this time will clearly demonstrate to the world our determination to support the will to seek peace with the strength to seek peace. I believe that the American people, through Congress, will decide to adopt universal military training, which is crucial to encouraging every free government in the world.</p>
<p>Third, I suggest the temporary re-enactment of conscription legislation to maintain adequate strength in our armed forces.</p>
<p>Our armed forces lack the personnel necessary to maintain adequate strength. Although the strength of the armed forces has been reduced to the minimum necessary to meet overseas obligations, far below the minimum it should be on the American mainland, our armed forces cannot maintain their proper strength through voluntary enlistment.</p>
<p>Unless we maintain our armed forces, we cannot fulfill our international responsibilities, such as maintaining our occupying forces in Germany until peace and stability are achieved in Europe.</p>
<p>There is no conflict between the need for conscription in the regular army and universal training in the reserves. Conscription is necessary until the foundation of universal training is laid, at which point conscription can be terminated and the regular army can be maintained on the basis of volunteers.</p>
<p>The proposals I have made represent the most urgent steps to achieve peace and prevent war.</p>
<p>We must be prepared to take all wise and necessary steps to achieve this great goal. This will require us to provide assistance to other countries. It will also require adequate and well-coordinated military strength. We must be prepared to pay the price of peace, or we can be sure that we will pay the price of war.</p>
<p>We in America remain determined to seek a just and honorable basis for resolving international disputes in every possible way. We will continue to be loyal to the United Nations and use it as the primary means of achieving international security based on law rather than force. We will always be ready and eager to cooperate with other nations—I repeat, with all nations—to achieve international understanding in every possible endeavor.</p>
<p>For the Soviet Union and any other country willing to cooperate sincerely to preserve peace, this door has never been closed, and it will not be closed in the future.</p>
<p>At the same time, we must not be confused about the central problem facing the world today.</p>
<p>The time has come when the free men and women of the world must bravely face the threats to their freedom.</p>
<p>The United States has a great responsibility to act for the welfare of the world based on our strength. We have learned that we must obtain the peace we seek through genuine effort and not through illusion, just as we fought for victory in war. At no time in our history has the unity of our people been more important than now.</p>
<p>To fully shoulder the tasks before us, unity of purpose, unity of effort, and unity of spirit are essential.</p>
<p>Everyone here today has a special responsibility. The situation in the world is so critical, and the responsibilities of this country are so great, that partisan strife cannot be allowed to diminish our influence in maintaining peace.</p>
<p>The American people have the right to assume that political issues will not affect our common work. They have the right to assume that in our efforts to maintain world peace, we will move forward hand in hand with all our might and without hesitation. With the help of God, we will succeed."

<p>[Report from this newspaper] The city's initial conscription this year involves 6,000 men. The Civil Affairs Bureau, citing the city's status as an industrial and commercial area, previously requested the city government to forward a request to the National Government to reduce the quota by 1,000 men this year. Yesterday, a telegram from the National Government rejected the request, stating that the city's conscription quota for the 37th year had already been reduced, being lower than the ratio for any other province (or city), so the requested reduction would not be approved.</p>
<p>[Another report] Regarding the review of applications for exemption or deferment of military service for eligible men in the city, this was completed at the end of last year. However, if the reasons for deferment arise after the review, supporting documents can still be submitted for a temporary supplementary review for deferment. However, those suspected of evasion are excluded. Recently, the Civil Affairs Bureau has received numerous letters requesting deferment based on the above circumstances, and supplementary reviews will be conducted.</p>

<p>[Report from this newspaper] Interior staff of the British Tram Company staged a "petition by work stoppage" yesterday morning. This was because the labor union had previously submitted four demands to the company's management. After mediation by the Social Affairs Bureau, the company accepted three of the demands, but a resolution on the issue of year-end salary increases for staff could not be reached. As a result, the staff felt that the authorities were deliberately discriminating against them and expressed great dissatisfaction. They then decided to petition individually. The chairman of the labor union, Qiu Changjiang, and others tried their best to dissuade them but were unsuccessful. Therefore, the standing director Chen Chunbao and seven staff representatives went to the Social Affairs Bureau. The deputy director of the Social Affairs Bureau, Zhao, personally received them and urged them to resume work immediately. As for the issue of year-end salary increases, the bureau scheduled a meeting with both labor and management at 10:00 AM this morning to mediate. The petitioning staff complied and resumed work in full at 1:00 PM in the afternoon, making up for the work missed in the morning.</p>

<p>[Report from this newspaper] The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Haihu ship ran aground in the waters of Xia Dou, with a serious situation. The headquarters continuously dispatched ships for rescue, and various developments have been reported in this newspaper. Yesterday, according to reliable information from the company, the location where the Haihu ship ran aground is near Jinmen Island, where the previous Haizhe ship ran aground. In the past few days, the ship's power was cut off, and radio communication was lost, so there was no news. Now it is known that the situation has improved, and the Min 302 tugboat has arrived at the scene of the accident. The Xiamen branch has also dispatched multiple barges and is trying to unload the cargo in the cabin. Furthermore, the Jian Lun, which was transferred from Qingdao for rescue, has arrived in Shanghai yesterday and is scheduled to sail to Xiamen today to assist in the towing and rescue. According to Captain Fan Lun of the Jian Lun, if there is no change in the sea climate, the rescue work can be carried out smoothly. It was also stated that the Jian Lun was originally in Qingdao to rescue the Mingxing ship of the Zhongxing Company, which ran aground after hitting a reef. Initially, the stern of the ship sank, and rescue seemed hopeless. Recently, the ship's body suddenly leveled, and there is a possibility of escaping the danger. However, this ship urgently needed to go to Xiamen to rescue the Haihu ship, so the insurance company that underwrote the Mingxing ship has hired technicians to try to rescue it.</p>

<p>[Report from this newspaper] According to sources from the Civil Food Allocation Department, the oil rationing per capita in this city will continue to be implemented in April, with twelve ounces per person per month. The implementation will proceed after discussion at the Municipal Council meeting.</p>
<h3 id="e88">Next Month Allotted Rice Will Be American Rice; Rice Ration Coupons to Be Distributed on the 26th; Rice Market Should Employ Purchase Policies <a href="#e88" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c88" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">88</a></h3>
<p>[Our Reporter] The People's Food Allocation Committee of this city has decided that the rice ration coupons for April, which are sold based on population, will be sent to the district offices on March 25th and distributed by the 26th. It is hoped that all citizens will be able to receive their ration coupons by the end of the month. All the rice allotted next month will be American relief rice, and the quality is very good. The Allocation Committee is preparing to start delivering rice to various rice retailers on March 28th, starting with one-third, totaling 170,000 shih, before the end of the month. It is expected that citizens will be able to purchase the allotted rice with their coupons at the beginning of April.</p>
<p>[Our Reporter] Since the implementation of the comprehensive rice rationing in this city from March to date, the amount of rationed rice released from the warehouses has reached 350,000 shih. It is estimated that this figure accounts for about 50% of the city's total monthly demand for rice, which has greatly affected the rice sales in the market. The North and South Rice Markets specifically petitioned the People's Food Allocation Committee, claiming that the market has been sluggish in recent weeks, and prices have repeatedly fallen, even below the production area. This has led to a gradual decrease in arrivals. If this phenomenon continues, it will inevitably make the city's reserves even more empty. Therefore, they requested the People's Food Allocation Committee to implement a purchase policy, entrusting the management committees of the North and South Rice Markets to conduct the purchases on their behalf. This request will be submitted to the municipal meeting for discussion by Chairman Ren.</p>

<p>[Our Reporter] At around 3:00 PM on the afternoon of the 11th, a car suddenly drove into the Wusong Wai Ma Lu Bus Station and unloaded four wooden boxes. A person stood beside them, looking like he was waiting for transshipment. Lou Qishui, a police officer on duty at the Wusong Police Station, went forward to ask what was in the boxes. He was told they were cigarettes, and the officer left. Glancing back, he saw that the man looked suspicious, so he turned back and interrogated him, and opened the boxes. As expected, he found a large number of cigarettes, and after removing the cigarette packaging, he discovered that they were all Western medicines and photographic materials. He took them all to the station. The man confessed that his name was Lin Zhigao, from Chongming, and that a friend had asked him to take the items to Chongming to sell. The station deemed the goods to be prohibited exports, fearing that they would flow into the communist-controlled areas, and immediately detained him. The case was then submitted to the Municipal Police Bureau for investigation the next day.</p>

<p>[Our Reporter] Lan Chunchi, a former specialist committee member of the Executive Yuan, is accused of using his position to illegally allocate two new trucks to the "Fu-Pu-Xian Automobile Transportation Company" in Fujian. The case is under investigation by the District Procuratorate, which has sent a letter to the Fujian Provincial Government to investigate, but has not yet received a reply. The District Procuratorate summoned Zheng Zhongwu, the chairman of the "Fu-Pu-Xian Automobile Transportation Company," who is also a Supervisory Committee member and National Assembly representative, to testify. Zheng, who had passed through Shanghai from Min to Beijing to attend the National Assembly, reported to the District Procuratorate to testify. According to Zheng's testimony, he was the founder and chairman of the "Fu-Pu-Xian Automobile Transportation Company," which was later changed to the Putian Private Automobile Company. However, the company is now closed. During his tenure as chairman, he applied to the Executive Yuan for two trucks and sent employees Chen Qing and Lin Yimei to Shanghai to pick them up. He was not very clear about the details. Chen has now gone to Southeast Asia, and Lin is still in Putian, it is said. The prosecutor, seeking to clarify the truth, will summon Lin for questioning.</p>

The ship arrived in Shanghai from Guangzhou via Shantou on the 16th.

Customs officers discovered this and detained the sampan along with the smuggled goods. After the ship docked at the Huashun Wharf, customs officers thoroughly inspected the ship and passengers' luggage, resulting in the seizure of eight gold bars and other smuggled goods such as foreign goods and Western medicines, with a very large value.</p>

<p>Due to the large number of people going on spring outings, the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway Bureaus expect that passenger traffic on the two lines will be very crowded on Saturdays and Sundays. They recently decided to add a first-class reserved-seat car to the No. 72 special express train departing from Shanghai to Wuxi at 8:30 AM on Sunday mornings. This was trialed for the past two weeks, but most passengers still preferred to purchase tickets for the Triumph Express departing from Shanghai at 8:00 AM, resulting in the Triumph Express often being fully booked, while the No. 72 train, which departed half an hour later, was very empty. The Railway Bureau hopes that passengers traveling from Shanghai to Suzhou and Wuxi in the future can take the 8:30 AM special express train to avoid difficulties in purchasing tickets.</p>

The High Court has now ruled to overturn the original sentence and change it to fifteen years of imprisonment.</p>
<h3 id="e95">Shanxi Field and Grain Director, etc., Pass Through Shanghai to Beijing to Request Emergency Food Aid from the Central Government <a href="#e95" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c95" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">95</a></h3>
<p>[Our Reporter] The Shanxi Provincial Government, considering the serious food shortage in the province urgently in need of relief, dispatched Guan Minquan, Director of the Department of Construction, Geng Shi, Director of the Field and Grain Department, Liang Xianwu, Director of the Department of Social Affairs, Yin Yulan, Counselor of the Provincial Government, and He Defu, a member of the Provincial Assembly, yesterday from Ping by plane to Shanghai. They planned to take the train to Beijing that evening to visit the relevant authorities to present the real situation of the food shortage in Shanxi.</p>
<p>Allocation of 20,000 Tons of Grain to Be Transported in Seven Months</p>
<p>Yesterday afternoon at 4:00 PM, they hosted reporters from various newspapers in the city on the fifth floor of the Bankers' Association. Geng Shi first reported the purpose of going to Beijing, saying: The food shortage in Shanxi Province is serious. Chairman Yan has previously telegraphed Chairman Chiang and Premier Zhang separately to request relief, and concrete solutions have been obtained. Therefore, this trip to Beijing is not in the nature of a petition. It is only intended to make a detailed presentation to the central government on the actual difficulties in local food supply. The Shanxi Provincial Government initially requested the central government to allocate 30,000 tons of food. Now, considering the actual situation, it plans to request the central government to allocate a minimum of 5,000 tons of relief grain and 5,000 tons of regulatory grain. In addition, it will request loans from the Four Joint Offices and ask the Ministry of Food to purchase 10,000 tons, totaling 20,000 tons. Using ten airplanes, operating twice a day, it will take about seven months to transport it. The Shanxi Provincial Government is currently investigating the amount of wild vegetables to be used as supplementary food. At the same time, it has implemented a food reduction program, distributing the food for four people to five people.</p>
<p>Each Bag of Flour Costs as Much as Six Million</p>
<p>He Defu then delivered a speech, saying: Currently, the communist army in Shanxi Province maintains a force of more than 100,000 troops, constantly harassing the area, and transportation has been cut off. Moreover, among the 3.6 million people in central Shanxi, more than 600,000 refugees have been forced to flee to safe areas due to the communist "locust policy". Furthermore, last year's drought was followed by floods, which is the biggest reason for the current food shortage in central Shanxi. Currently, each bag of flour in Taiyuan costs more than 6 million yuan, each dan of millet costs 11 million yuan, and each jin of sorghum costs 80,000 yuan, and there is nowhere to buy it. Previously, the Shanxi Provincial Government could exchange one piece of No. 3 coarse cloth for one dan and three dou and six sheng of wheat from the people, but now it is impossible to exchange even five dou. It is estimated that in the next three months, on average, 40% of the people in central Shanxi will not be able to obtain food. The situation has reached an extremely serious stage. Therefore, it is urged that the central government quickly allocate food and strengthen air transport to alleviate the urgent need. Otherwise, it is also proposed to request the central government to grant loans to purchase and transport food from the provinces of Chahar and Suiyuan. At the same time, it is hoped that the public opinion circles will provide enthusiastic support. The reception ended at 5:30 PM.</p>

<p>[Our Reporter] Wu Zhide, 25 years old, from Suzhou, who runs a rice business, is staying in room 428 of the Da Zhonghua Hotel. At about 1:00 PM the day before yesterday, he went to the Central Market on Sichuan Road, holding a diamond ring worth about 15 million yuan and loudly offering it for sale. Many people gathered to watch. Soon, a swindler named Tong Shi'ren approached him, falsely claiming that the manager of the Deda Hotel wanted to buy it. He took the diamond ring to the entrance of the Deda Hotel and told Wu to wait for a moment. Unexpectedly, the swindler entered through the front door and exited through the back door, disappearing without a trace. More than half an hour later, Wu realized that he had been defrauded and went to the Huopu Police Station to report it. Li Yinmin, the section chief, ordered officers Ren Fengwu and Zhou Xueqin, the police chief, to wait in the area of the Central Market the next afternoon. They finally arrested the swindler Tong Shi'ren and brought him to the branch office, where he confessed to the fraud. It has been decided to submit the case to the District Procuratorate today for investigation.</p>
<h3 id="e97">Price Fluctuation Statistics; Rice Rose the Least, Stocks Rose the Most <a href="#e97" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c97" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">97</a></h3>
<p>[Our Reporter] According to a survey by the Municipal People's Food Allocation Committee, the price fluctuations of various important commodities in the city from February 28th to the 16th of this month are listed for comparison. Bai Geng rose by 13.3%, Xian rice rose by 9.5%, 20-count Double Horse yarn rose by 20.9%, Longtou fine cloth rose by 32.6%, Yongsha stocks rose by 68.4%, and Gubenzao soap rose by 12.9%. The person in charge of the Allocation Committee analyzed the above statistics, believing that the increase in the price of rice was the smallest, approximately equal to the black market interest rate, and Xian rice was even lower than the interest rate, which proves that the rice rationing policy has been effective. Due to the sluggish sales in the rice market, idle capital has been concentrated in stocks and other markets. Therefore, it is believed that suppressing prices requires coordinated efforts to achieve significant results.</p>

Last year, he applied to the Examination Yuan to participate in the county magistrate examination and submitted a graduation certificate from the Political Economy Department of Qunzhi Agricultural and Commercial College, signed by Principal He Jian and Dean of Academic Affairs Lu Zhaoqing. The Examination Yuan inquired with the Hunan Provincial Department of Education, but there was no record of Pan in the graduation roster of Qunzhi College. The Examination Yuan suspected Pan of forging the diploma and sent a letter to the Judicial Administration Department to instruct the court in this city to investigate. The District Procuratorate summoned Pan for questioning the other day. He denied the forgery and claimed that He Jian knew about it. As a result, Fang Guohua, the second squadron leader of the corps, provided bail for him to be summoned at any time.</p>

<p>The "Shanghai Nursing Ten," the Shanghai Municipal Citizens' Emergency First Aid Station, which was organized by the Police Bureau's Fire Department in a short period of time, held a simple and solemn establishment ceremony at the department yesterday morning at 10:00 AM, announcing its official establishment and commencement of service. The ceremony was presided over by Zhou Zhaoxiang, who is also the chief stationmaster, and Wang Hanmei, deputy chief stationmaster, Ye Binyong, chief of the Fire Department's First Aid Section, and the fire chiefs of various fire districts were all present. Police Bureau Chief Yu Shuping delivered a training speech at about 10:00 AM, stating: "The Shanghai Municipal Citizens' Emergency First Aid Station, like the Flying Fortress and the Mobile Police Station, can be called sister flowers. The first aid station is limited by funding, so it will first set up three sub-stations, and will strive to expand in the future. Nurses and paramedics in the first aid station should aim to serve the citizens and win the praise of all sectors to bring glory to the police." Zhou, who is also the chief stationmaster, then gave a training speech to encourage them. The ceremony ended at 11:00 AM. There are currently ten service nurses and forty paramedic police officers. The nurses all wear white work clothes, white socks, white leather shoes, and white nurse caps, with the words "Shanghai Police Bureau" in blue and "Shanghai Nurse" in red embroidered on the pocket of their chest. The paramedic police officers all wear red cross armbands. When the "Shanghai Nurses" are dispatched for first aid, they will issue a postcard to each patient's family, asking them to write their comments on the postcard and send it back to the Fire Department, which will try its best to accept the opinions and improve. In the future, if citizens encounter emergency illnesses, infectious diseases, etc., they can dial 18600, and the ambulance will arrive within five minutes.</p>
<p>Moreover, the "Shanghai Nurses" had just completed the establishment ceremony at 11:00 AM yesterday morning, when the Central Station and the other three stations received a report that Yang Aizhi, a 54-year-old female worker at the Yizhong Tobacco Factory at 733 Changyang Road, had fallen from the escalator and fractured her left tibia and fibula.

<h3 id="e108">UNRRA's Sixty Fishing Vessels to Be Sold; Method Decided; Price Starts at US$30,000 Per Vessel; Those with Greater Wartime Losses Will Have Priority for Purchase <a href="#e108" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c108" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">108</a></h3>
<p>[Our Reporter] The Fisheries Management Office of the Custodial Committee of the Relief and Rehabilitation Commission has previously decided to sell 60 UNRRA fishing vessels to fishermen. The draft detailed sales measures have also been properly formulated by representatives of UNRRA and the Executive Yuan. It was submitted to the Executive Yuan at the beginning of this month, and sales can begin as soon as the Executive Yuan approves it.</p>
<p>According to reporters from relevant parties, the main points of the sales method are as follows: (1) The price of each fishing vessel ranges from US$30,000 to US$120,000, and the legal currency is paid according to the exchange rate of the Central Bank at the time of sale. If the purchaser cannot pay in one lump sum, in order to encourage fishery production, they may be allowed to pay in installments within five years. (2) Any legally registered fishery companies, fishermen, and fishery cooperatives are eligible to apply for purchase. Organizations with better equipment and greater wartime losses will have priority for purchase. (3) Applicants must be carefully reviewed by a committee jointly organized by the Fisheries Management Office, the Fisheries Association, and the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry, and only those who pass the examination will be allowed to purchase. It is also learned that to date, the number of applicants to purchase fishing vessels has exceeded 60. All 60 fishing vessels are currently stored at the Fisheries Management Office on Fuxing Island for sale and do not participate in work. Regarding the drivers of new-style fishing vessels, if future purchasers need them, they can also be hired. However, some fishing companies have already sent personnel to the training class there for training and can take up the work immediately after the fishing vessels are purchased.</p>
<p>In addition, the Fisheries Management Office currently has 127 fishing vessels. In addition to the 60 vessels sold and 10% (i.e., 12 vessels) dedicated to training, 50 vessels are retained for fishing and other purposes. However, because these vessels need to be repaired and refurbished successively, only 25 to 30 vessels are frequently used. The Fisheries Management Office plans to establish a company in conjunction with the semi-mechanical wooden boats made by themselves in accordance with the resolution of the Custodial Committee at this conference, and will set up branches in Qingdao, Wenzhou, Yulin, Taiwan and other places, but it is still in the planning stage.</p>

<h3 id="e109">A Glimpse into the Lu Central Campaign <a href="#e109" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c109" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">109</a></h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Jinan 15th Dispatched Telegram] The Communist bandits concentrated the only Ninth Column of the Bi Dong Field Army, and parts of the 13th and 14th Columns (to be verified) from southeastern Shandong and Jiaodong, plus four garrison brigades and four independent regiments, totaling about 50,000 men. Starting at midnight on the 10th of this month, they suddenly launched a pincer offensive towards Zhangdian, Zhoucun, Ganchuan, and Boshan in central Shandong, attempting to repeat their February Laiwu campaign tactics, to encircle and annihilate the National Army's field army. The development of the battle to the present has already proven that history will never repeat itself. Chen Yi's bandit troops' wishful thinking has clearly suffered a severe failure. The Communist bandits launching this pincer offensive were divided into three routes: One route took the Su Town east of Huantai as a base to attack Zhangdian, another took Lucun, the location of the Lu Central Military Region, as a base to attack Boshan, and the third route, which was the main force of the bandits, also took Su Town as a base, divided into groups to cross the Xiaofu River, and scurried to Zhoucun and Huantai.</p>
<p>On the Zhangdian front, the National Army only had one company, and the bandits used more than 4,000 men to encircle and fiercely attack. The National Army, facing a huge disparity in numbers, defended bitterly until noon on the 11th, and finally, due to running out of ammunition and having no reinforcements, the entire company heroically sacrificed themselves. More than 2,000 employees of the Zhangdian Office of the Jiaoji Railway made emergency arrangements when the situation became critical, and retreated westward. However, when they were advancing to the vicinity of Ma Shang Station, they encountered an ambush by the bandit army. Up to now, less than one-fifth have returned to Jinan. What is definitely known is that Engineer Fan Peilun has been captured by the Communist bandits.</p>
<p>The National Army on the Boshan front, due to its weak strength, in order to avoid being "defeated one by one" and "the large eating the small" by the bandits, Wang Yaowu ordered the defending troops, local militias, local Catholic personnel, and miners to all concentrate in Zichuan in an emergency. Zichuan received this support, and its strength doubled. Therefore, from the 11th to the morning of the 14th, Zichuan City and the Fan Hongshan Zibo Coal Mining Company were still in the hands of the National Army. The third route of the Communist bandits was to attack Zhoucun and Huantai, especially Zhoucun, which was their main target of attack. The reason is that this "largest village in the country" is the garrison of Zhou Qingxiang's Reorganized Division of the National Army. The war has been going on since the 11th until the evening of the 12th. In 48 hours, the Communist bandits fired cannons like rain, and launched six frontal assaults, suffering losses of at least more than 5,000 men. In order to achieve his strategic goals and avoid being "eaten," Wang Yaowu used his greatest wisdom to withdraw the entire division to the line north and south of Longshan Station, 33 kilometers east of Jinan City, within 12 hours, to defend the eastern gate of Jinan. Some people believe that the National Army's retreat of more than a hundred miles inevitably caused great suffering to the local people. In fact, if this plan was not adopted, not only might Zhou's troops have been "eaten up," but Jinan would have been even more critical. The reason is that the defense forces of Jinan at that time were unimaginably weak. This preserved the strength, leaving the Communist bandits "empty-handed." At the same time, it also stabilized Jinan City and its surrounding areas.</p>
<p>When the battle of Zhoucun developed to its climax, the Jinpu Railway near Sangnan Station, north of the Yellow River and only ten kilometers away from Jinan City, became tense. General Wang Yaowu used his highest wisdom and greatest perseverance to make the greatest use of this most limited force. The troops on the eastern route quickly relied on the deployment, and part of the troops on the southern route were also concentrated. The originally well-trained militias and volunteer police were fully utilized, making Jinan City a steel city that could not be opened or broken within 24 hours.</p>
<p>Although the collective southward migration of some wealthy merchants and the families of senior and mid-level officers in the pacification area once caused excitement, when they learned that this was Commander Wang's intention to allow his subordinates to have no worries and concentrate on the work of defending Jinan and Shandong, everyone became more calm and stable.</p>
<h3 id="e110">The Possibility of Communist Bandits Invading Jinan is Extremely Low <a href="#e110" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c110" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">110</a></h3>
<p>What is currently lingering in the minds of the people of the country is whether the Communist bandits will follow up with a large-scale attack on Jinan? Regarding this question, the reporter's personal answer is that the possibility is very low. The main purposes of the Communist bandits' invasion of Zhoucun, Zhangdian, and other places this time are two: One is to try to use the large to eat the small and eat our Zhou Qingxiang's troops. The second is to try to attract the main force of the National Army to concentrate near Jinan, and then extensively destroy the Pujin section of the Jinpu Railway, especially Xupu, to expand their harassment offensive against northern Jiangsu and northern Anhui, and even threaten the safety of Pukou, so that the representatives attending the National Congress in the capital can hear the sound of artillery and taste a false alarm. If the Communist bandits had the intention of invading Jinan from the beginning, then while attacking Zhoucun and Zhangdian, at least three columns of bandits in southwestern Shandong should have gone north to cut off the central section of the Jinpu transportation in the area north and south of Dawenkou, in order to prevent the northward reinforcements of the National Army from the south. Then, the bandits on the eastern route in Zhoucun would join the bandits to invade Jinan. The Communist bandits did not do this, and they used too few troops this time. Therefore, this can easily help us understand that the Communist bandits have no intention of invading Jinan City on a large scale, at least for the time being.</p>
<p>Reviewing this Shandong campaign, the greatest success of the National Army is that the regular army did not suffer heavy losses. But on the contrary, the local militias rebuilt in Qidong, Huantai, Changshan, Zouping, Zhoucun, and other places failed to fully exert their due power.

<p>Section Chief and Others Beaten, Six Culprits Captured</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper Changshu 17th Telegram] Conscription work here is in full swing. The original quota has been more than half filled. The troops from the army units dispatched to receive the new recruits have opened to Suzhou. There are still 254 new recruits in the conscription office. Bi Xinquan, the military section chief of the county government, went to inspect at around 8:00 PM on the 16th and suddenly saw new recruits gathered in several places, gambling with great excitement, shouting and yelling, and the order was chaotic. He immediately lectured them to obey discipline and ordered them to stop. Unexpectedly, Zhang Jinrong, a new recruit from Shiqiao Township, expressed dissatisfaction and uttered wild words. Section Chief Bi immediately ordered the guards to punish him. Unexpectedly, Zhang suddenly raised his fist and punched Section Chief Bi in the head. Fortunately, he leaned to the left and was only hit in the shoulder twice. At that time, the new recruits remaining in the office took the opportunity to riot. The manager, Zheng Jiong, was destroyed in the chaos, suffered chest injuries, and had difficulty breathing. He was immediately sent to the hospital for treatment. The guards heard the alarm and, fearing that trouble would break out, immediately fired a shot into the air to show force. At the same time, they telegraphed County Magistrate Zhang. Zhang, the head of the Security Brigade, urgently assembled officers and soldiers from all brigades and rushed to suppress them. They first surrounded the location and then led troops inside to suppress them, and the situation calmed down. The main culprit, Zhang Jinrong, and accomplices Sun Guiting, Yuan Zhiquan, Mao Jihou, Zhao Guanfa, and Li Yi, were captured one after another. They were escorted to the county government that night and handed over to the military court for interrogation on the 17th.</p>

When people talk about tigers, they all change color. Whenever they hear of "tiger disasters," they often leave their hometowns and take their wives and children far away.</p>
<p>Regarding the distribution of such carnivores in Fujian Province, according to past discoveries and records, they are roughly divided into four categories: The first is the Wuyi Mountain range in northern Fujian, including Jianyang, Shuiji, Chongan, Pucheng, and five or six other counties. On average, there are more than ten tiger disasters every year. The second is the Yong'an, Datian, Youxi, and Shunchang counties in western Fujian, with about a hundred tiger disasters every year. The third is the Jinjiang, Yongchun, Dehua, and Xianyou counties in southern Fujian, with dozens of tiger disasters every year. The fourth is the Ningde, Pingnan, Zhouning, Shouning, and Zhenghe counties in eastern Fujian, with more than ten tiger disasters every year. Among them, the counties in northwestern Fujian are the most common, and the number of people and livestock devoured each year is also greater than in other places. These tigers, small ones "patrol alone," devouring people and livestock that are hidden. Large ones come in groups, knocking on doors and breaking into houses, capturing livestock and children one by one, and then roaring away. The sound of the tiger's roar shakes the mountains and mountains, those who hear it lose their courage, and those who see it are desolate. Therefore, the residents can do nothing about it. Sometimes, in the dark of night, they suddenly hear a tiger's roar, and in the blink of an eye, the tiger arrives, wanting to enter the door. Families often block the door and resist, knocking on utensils to cheer themselves on, hoping that the tiger will be frightened and return to its nest. Over time, people lose all confidence and often regard tigers as divine creatures. Whenever they hear a tiger warning, they burn incense day and night to pray for it to leave. The tragic situation in this is difficult to describe in detail.</p>
<p>The northwestern counties of Fujian Province all have tiger hunting organizations. The method is still to dig traps, install mechanisms, and lure tigers into the shells, then catch and kill them, taking the bones, joints, fat, and blood for medicine, and making tiger skins into clothing. However, in recent years, due to the people's lack of time and the fact that all civilian guns have been confiscated, tiger hunting is no longer possible. Generally new hunters each difficult get involved with mountain area, and launch a surprise attack after waiting. Therefore, in recent years, tiger disasters have tended to intensify. At the opening day of the Fujian Provincial Senate, three or four senators asked the police and security department to train their subordinates to fight tigers and requested that Lu Da add a tiger-fighting course. This humorous conversation was also triggered by this.</p>
<p>The Institute of Zoology and Botany of the Fujian Provincial Research Institute sent Technician Yang Yangyi to Shunchang in the early autumn of last year to collect specimens. Before long, Yang became known for hunting a famous giant tiger in Shunchang. The tiger has now been transported to the Fuzhou West Lake Products Exhibition Hall for public display. The reporter also visited the exhibition a few days ago. The tiger is installed in a glass tree, with a white forehead, hanging eyes, and sharp teeth facing each other. Its body is interspersed with yellow and white stripes, and its ferocious appearance is indescribable. It is about six feet long and more than three feet high, slightly larger than ordinary tigers. According to Wang Yingke, the director of the museum, the tiger has devoured no less than one hundred people in the Shunchang area, and the number of livestock devoured is not included. The eradication of this disaster not only made Shunchang County rejoice, but also made the counties in northern Fujian, which were worried about tiger disasters, happy. It is especially effective in clarifying the erroneous concept of the public "fearing tigers like gods." (Our Newspaper Reporter Huang Zhenqing)</p>

<h3 id="e125">Burma Since Independence - Continued from Page Two <a href="#e125" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c125" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">125</a></h3>
<p>Generally speaking, Burma's current political situation seems to be still precarious. The current government claims to be left-leaning and strives to seek welfare for the common people, but its implementation is not thorough and is hampered. As a result, it fails to please both sides. The Communist Party is naturally active in secret, while right-leaning parties representing the interests of the landlord class, led by Ba Maw, the leader of the People's Party, are also eager to rise up. Furthermore, the ruling Socialist Party and the Volunteer Army themselves are not able to cooperate seamlessly. The press corps witnessed several major events during their stay in Rangoon, which offer a glimpse into the situation. One was the arrest of Red Flag Communist leader Thakin Soe in the city on March 12th. Documents seized from him revealed that the Red Flag Party was planning an uprising on March 20th to seize power. Secondly, after the war, Rangoon was filled with street vendors and shacks. The government initially did not interfere in order to please the poor, but later, under the attack and pressure of the landlord class, it ordered the demolition of shacks in a certain area of ​​the city center. This caused protests and petitions from the vendors. The Communist Party took the opportunity to incite them from behind, and the government had to arrest a number of people before the situation was resolved. Thirdly, more than 1,000 workers from the Burma Oil Company went on strike on the 9th, parading in the streets and shouting slogans in a line more than a mile long.</p>
<p>Strike Incident - The labor unrest had not been resolved by the time the press corps left Rangoon. As a result, gasoline was unavailable in Rangoon, and the black market price soared to four rupees per gallon (equivalent to about 400,000 yuan in US dollars), and it was still not easy to buy. The strike was triggered by the dismissal of a worker by a supervisor for spending too long in the toilet. In reality, such a small matter was not enough to justify a major strike, and there was obviously a more complex story behind it.</p>
<p>Destroying Newspaper Offices - Another incident was that on March 12th, members of the Socialist Party held a farmers' and workers' rally at the Shwedagon Pagoda. After the meeting, the crowd destroyed three newspaper offices: the Communist Party's "People's Voice," "Aung Bama," and the right-wing "Economic News." They beat and injured an editor of one of the newspapers and threw a Japanese-style hand grenade, but fortunately it did not explode. The reason for the destruction was that the three newspapers published news insulting Thakin Tin, the Minister of Agriculture and Forestry and one of the leaders of the Socialist Party, accusing him of raping a woman. The content roughly stated that Thakin Tin was on a tour of northern Burma and stayed at someone's house. The daughter of that person was the wife of a driver in the ministry. She had returned home after a quarrel with her husband. Thakin Tin said that he could take her back to Rangoon to reconcile with her husband, but unexpectedly, he raped the woman at a hotel on the way. The news contained obscene descriptions. The day after the news was published, members of the Socialist Party, led by the Secretary of the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry, destroyed the three newspaper offices. After the incident, Prime Minister Thakin Nu strongly emphasized the need to maintain law and order in a broadcast and declared that the rioters would be severely punished, but this showed that the upper-level members of the government could not control the lower-level cadres. After this series of events, a "gossip news" item was published in the newspaper on the 14th, stating that the government had issued a curfew and even prohibited groups of more than five people from walking in a row in the busy area near the city hall.</p>
<p>Ethnic Minorities - The issue of ethnic minorities has not been completely resolved in Burma. The ethnic minorities in Burma include the Shans, Kachins, Chins, Karens, and Mons. In order to achieve national unity, the Burmese have tried their best to win over these ethnic minorities. The constitution stipulates that they should be given full autonomy. The current president, Sao Shwe Thaik, is the chief of the Shan people. Although he has no actual power, it can be said that the Burmese have gone to great lengths to please the ethnic minorities. Even so, the Karen people are still demanding autonomy and refusing to participate in the general election. During the press corps's stay in Rangoon, they sent several representatives to Rangoon to negotiate with the government. The outcome is still unpredictable.</p>
<p>Wartime Losses - Burma suffered heavy losses during the war. Destroyed buildings can be seen everywhere in Rangoon. Rangoon University, which occupies 400 acres not far from the city center, has a quiet environment, but its internal facilities can be said to be empty. Most of the school buildings have traces of gray and black smoke on the walls, and the library's collection has been completely burned to ashes. Because it is too poor, it is not known when the post-war reconstruction work can begin. Since independence, the government has formulated a two-year agricultural production increase plan in order to complete the cultivation of 12 million acres of land. Originally, Burma's rice exports before the war reached 3.5 million tons per year, but after the war it was less than 1 million tons. They hope to increase it to 1.5 million tons this year. In addition to increasing production, the government has to greatly increase taxes in order to make up for fiscal revenue. As a result, prices have risen sharply, and the average standard of living has increased by three times compared to before the war. However, the living standards of most Burmese people are extremely low, and Burma is a rice-producing country, so according to their government officials, the lives of ordinary people should not have problems.</p>
<p>Current Cultural Situation - In terms of culture, more than 90% of adults are illiterate. There are more than 20 Burmese and English newspapers in Rangoon, but they are all substandard. The largest newspaper has a circulation of only more than 10,000 copies. Burmese journalists are not as nervous and hurried as those in Shanghai. They have a journalists' association, and most of the news is said to be delivered to their door by government officials. They also have a day off every Sunday, so on Monday, except for a "Monday Express" that is published only on that day, all the others are completely suspended.</p>
<p>In terms of foreign relations, the Burmese can be said to have no strong xenophobia, but because they have just gained independence, just like a young man who has just left the countryside, they inevitably have a naive mentality of pride and arrogance. This is an impression commonly felt by most overseas Chinese in Rangoon. To be honest, the press corps did not have a very good impression of Burma during their ten-day stay in Rangoon. However, this may be because we had too high expectations for this newly liberated country. Therefore, as a brotherly country, we still sincerely wish that this newborn baby can grow stronger day by day and gradually embark on the road to prosperity. (End)</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper] The eight national universities in this city jointly submitted a request to the Ministry of Education last month to allocate five times the funds according to the budget for December last year, including additional funds. Minister Zhu has forwarded the petition to the Executive Yuan for approval, but the reply has not yet been issued. The schools are facing financial difficulties and it is difficult to maintain operations. Yesterday, Zhang Yi, president of Fudan University, said that in order to meet the urgent needs of the schools, the Ministry of Education decided to allocate the original 2 billion yuan of "expansion and improvement funds" of the schools as temporary expenses. According to the original plan, the expansion and improvement funds were intended to supplement construction. However, the Ministry of Education believes that the construction items of the schools can be postponed during this extraordinary period. Zhang also said that the prices of various public utilities have increased one after another, and the schools need about 1 billion yuan for water and electricity expenses alone.</p>

<h3 id="e151">Two Tense Basketball Games: Qingbai Comes from Behind, Renyu Fights Valiantly but Fails, Qingbai Wins by Three Points Against Chenyou, Renyu Loses to Enkas by One Point <a href="#e151" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c151" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">151</a></h3>
<p>[Our Report] The 甲 League of the basketball league is nearing its end. The two games last night were unexpectedly tense. Qingbai came from behind to defeat Chenyou by three points with a score of 55-52. In the first half, Chenyou overwhelmed Qingbai with a score of 31-23. In the last minute, Qingbai, in a dangerous situation, won the victory through the efforts of Xu Heng, who can be called the hero of last night. Enkas showed their true colors in the second half to avenge their defeat, resulting in a score of 35-33, only two points ahead. Renyu performed extremely well, but the rainy weather caused few fans to attend.</p>
<p>Qingbai Narrowly Defeats Chenyou</p>
<p>In the first game between Chenyou and Qingbai, the situation within ten minutes seemed to be slightly in favor of Chenyou. Xu Heng scored a free throw, and Qingbai tied the score at twelve points. Afterwards, they competed fiercely, with the score fluctuating. However, Chenyou's style was aggressive. In the first half Chenyou overwhelmed Qingbai with a score of 31-23.</p>
<p>In the second half, Qingbai made personnel adjustments. Zhuo Guorong, Zhang Shaoqing, and Wang Junbing were replaced by Wang Nanzhen, Zhou Dayun, and Chen Xianglong, which showed some improvement. When the opponent added three points, Qingbai suddenly increased by eight points, making the score 34-31. Guorong missed an open shot, Shaoqing made a layup, making the score 35-35. The situation began to change. Aheng made four consecutive free throws, thus catching up with the opponent. Chenyou's Wang Bingfu tied the score at 41-41, and the battle situation fluctuated. In the last three and a half minutes, Qingbai was only leading by two points with a score of 48-46. Chenyou called a timeout. Later, Wang Bingfu became a lucky general, leading 51-50, surpassing Qingbai. Cai Yanxiong committed his fifth foul, Wang made another free throw, Dayun replaced him, Xu Heng's two throws and one penalty made the score 55-52, turning defeat into victory in the last minute.</p>
<p>Enkas Defeats Renyu</p>
<p>In the game between Enkas and Renyu, Renyu first broke the net with a free throw. Enkas scored three points in an instant, but Renyu actually surpassed them again with a score of 7-3. Zhong Yixin's performance was active, and the foreign soldiers were at a loss. This was maintained for fifteen minutes until Ge Pengqi, Gu Gu, and Bao Lai were rampant under the basket, only then did they raise their heads, catching up by one point to 13-12. The momentum changed, and Bao Lai scored another point. In the first half the score was tied at 17. Because both sides were closely marking each other, they both lacked scoring opportunities. In the early part of the second half, Shen Pengju scored a free throw, tying the score at 22. Queli committed a foul, and Shen's two free throws made another contribution, surpassing them by two points. When the score was tied at 24, Zhong committed his fifth foul and was replaced by Li Zhaohe, greatly reducing the team's strength. The foreign soldiers made repeated changes, with Ma Han Fulanke taking turns entering the game, making the score 28-24. Renyu called a timeout, but there was no turnaround. Ma Han scored twice, making the score 32-25. Sun Guozheng was ousted, and Chen Weiyuan replaced him. Wu Xinyun scored in mid-air, and Yao Wenyi scored three points from free throws, closely following behind with a score of 30-32. But time was running out, and Renyu lost to the foreign soldiers by one point with a score of 33-35, Enkas avenging their old hatred.</p>

<h3 id="e152">Loan Measures Have Been Concretely Determined: Export Industry is Expected to Improve; Production, Transportation, and Sales Can All Receive Government Assistance <a href="#e152" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c152" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">152</a></h3>
<p>The issue of loans for export goods has been thoroughly discussed by all relevant parties and has been concretely determined. It is reported that, in addition to the discounting and packing loans for export goods, which national banks and bureaus will continue to handle as usual, they will also follow the recently approved fixed exchange settlement method for export goods by the Joint Treasury. This method is equivalent to mortgage loans. If an exporter has a transaction with a foreign importer, they can apply for a loan from a national bank or bureau with the order documents. The loan amount is limited to one-tenth of the foreign exchange value of the export goods. For example, if a foreign importer's order is worth US$1,000, the exporter can obtain a loan of US$100 from the national bank or bureau, which will be paid in national currency at the central bank's foreign exchange rate on that day. Exporters who obtain loans must export within a certain period. After the deadline, exporters must sell the export drafts to the lending bank or bureau to repay the loan. This method is more accurate and effective than general mortgage loans. In addition, with the discounting and packing loans, exporters can obtain government funding assistance during the production, transportation, and sales processes. There will definitely be no shortage of funds. Under these circumstances, the export industry is expected to improve in the future. Furthermore, after the implementation of the fixed exchange settlement method, if exporters do not fulfill the exchange settlement conditions, the lending bank or bureau may purchase the collateral.</p>
<h3 id="e153">Enthusiasm in the Yarn Market: Cotton Cloth Implements Price Limits; Dragon Head Fine Cloth Continues to Rise <a href="#e153" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c153" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">153</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the cotton yarn market was spurred by the fact that the Textile Construction Company did not list prices several times, and the available chips in the market suddenly felt scarce. In addition, with the rise in cloth prices, people were even more enthusiastic. Customers from Tianjin, Guangdong, and other regions absorbed goods strongly, and manufacturers on this street also made advances. The pulling and lifting within and outside the industry became more intense, and the market continued to rise.</p>
<p>42-count Blue Phoenix fine yarn immediately broke through the 190 million mark when it opened, and there were buyers willing to pay 95 million, and then it soared to 97 million. Later, due to the presence of police officers monitoring the scene, it returned to the opening price of 195 million yuan at the close. This was a surge of 18 million yuan compared to the previous day.</p>
<p>40-count and 32-count yarns of various grades also jumped by more than 10%. In addition, 21-count Double Horse spot yarn and warehouse receipts, as well as 20-count, 16-count, 10-count, and other yarns, all rose uniformly by varying amounts from 5-6 million to 11-12 million.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the cotton cloth market situation was extremely chaotic. The Yarn Management Bureau, in order to prevent excessive fluctuations in cloth prices, decided yesterday to implement price limits on cotton cloth transactions, stipulating that the daily increase should not exceed 5% of the previous day's closing price, which has already been implemented. The number of transactions in the market was not high. Buying and selling shifted to the streets and alleys, and the number of transactions was now in a state of apparent scarcity and hidden prosperity.</p>
<p>When the market opened, asking prices increased steadily. Dragon Head fine cloth prices hovered around 3.77-3.78 million. Some floating accounts sold off slightly during the middle of the day. Later, around 10 o'clock, because the Textile Construction Company listed Silver Moon fine cloth at 3.54 million, which was about 100,000 yuan higher than the market price, and the Yuan Biji and Zhigong were still not included, people suddenly became excited, and buying picked up again. At the same time, credit conditions eased slightly, and customer groups replenished their stocks in large quantities. Floating shorts also began to absorb goods, and the market trend turned from fatigue to firmness. It was further heard that the supply of raw cotton was difficult, and rumors of yarn mills reducing production were prevalent, which further boosted people's morale, and the market continued to soar wildly. 12-pound Dragon Head fine cloth even exceeded the price limit, and there were buyers willing to pay as high as 3.88 million yuan. Outside the market, it was further bid up to 3.9 million, but there were no sellers, which was 130,000-140,000 yuan and 200,000-300,000 yuan higher than the previous day. Other cloths also rose significantly.</p>
<p>[Our Report] Yesterday, the China Textile Construction Company sold cloth as usual, selling a total of 16,950 bolts of cloth and 350 sheets. There were 571 applications, of which 40 were from manufacturers, purchasing 1,920 bolts of cloth. The remainder was purchased by various cloth shops.</p>
<p>Another report: Yesterday, the price of 23×23 Silver Moon fine cloth supplied by the Textile Construction Company was 3.54 million. There were many applicants, and the purchase permits were increased by 50,000 to 170,000 yuan. Until the end, it was heard that yarn prices had soared by more than 10%. 12-pound Dragon Head fine cloth is expected to reach a high price of 4 million yuan again on the delivery date tomorrow. The price limit for Five Happiness fine cloth is 3.515 million yuan, but it was bid up to 3.68 million yuan outside the market, and there were still no suppliers, indicating a further jump is likely.</p>
<h3 id="e154">Raw Cotton Exhaustion <a href="#e154" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c154" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">154</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the raw cotton market continued to rise. People in the industry unanimously looked at higher prices, and because yarn and cloth continued to rise and the source of origin was exhausted, asking prices were very high, and transactions were rare. It was said that Zhengzhou cotton was priced at 20 million yuan for delivery to the public warehouse, Shashi at 17.25 million, Huoji at 14.4 million, and Zhoupu seed cotton at 3.5-3.6 million.</p>
<h3 id="e155">Rayon Firm, Silk Goods Rise <a href="#e155" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c155" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">155</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the rayon market was firm. 120-count Asahi brand glossy rayon opened slightly weaker in the morning, priced at 215 million yuan. Then, because various parties had a strong appetite, the market improved. By noon, the spot price was 200 million yuan, and the forward price was 240 million yuan. The afternoon was very stable, and it was once priced at 250 million yuan, but it was finally sold at 230 million yuan.</p>
<p>Factory-produced silk was slightly higher yesterday. Asking prices for five-load goods of various grades were all 5 million yuan higher than the previous day. The asking price for C-grade goods was around 320 million yuan, but there were no transactions. It appeared that high zero-grade transactions were around 305 million yuan, and the market for high zero-load lots was still around 260 million yuan. The silk goods market rose yesterday. Huaqiang Real Silk quilt covers opened at 156 million yuan and rose until the close of the market at 110 million yuan. Because raw materials were firm and expensive, and people were optimistic about the market, asking prices rose sharply. Dachang checkered Bi crepe closed at 428,000 yuan in the morning. The factory prices of other goods did not change much.</p>
<h3 id="e156">Kerosene Rises Again <a href="#e156" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c156" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">156</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the kerosene market rose again because foreign exchange rates were higher and costs increased. Wholesale prices among dealers were also increased. High-grade barreled goods even rose to around 20 million yuan before they were available for sale. Mobil and Asiatic canned oil broke through the 2 million mark, reaching as high as 2.2 million yuan. Retail prices were 48,000 to 51,200 yuan per catty. The price limit was also adjusted, increasing from 25,000 to 33,000 yuan per catty, a sharp increase of more than 10%.</p>
<h3 id="e157">Foreign Exchange Eases, Credit Conditions Loosen Slightly: Rice Prices Rose Again Yesterday, Flour, Oil, and Coarse Grains All Rose <a href="#e157" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c157" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">157</a></h3>
<p>[Our Report] The rice market stopped falling and rose yesterday due to the extension of foreign exchange rates, the change from tight to loose credit conditions, and the reported higher prices from producing areas. Prices of various grades all rose by more than 100,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Yesterday, 2,229 piculs arrived at the South City registration office and 3,864 piculs at the North City registration office. White glutinous rice was 3.45 million in the South City and 3.58 million in the North City. Thin indica rice was 3.45 million in the South City and 3.46 million in the North City. Early rice was 3.3 million in both the North and South Cities. Special glutinous rice was 3.6 million in the South City and 3.7 million in the North City.</p>
<p>Flour</p>
<p>Continued to rise slightly. Yesterday, credit conditions eased slightly, the North Gang absorbed goods, and the rise in rice prices also boosted morale, and many people replenished their stocks at low prices. Bingchuan and Laoche customer groups frequented the market, and transactions were more active. Bingchuan flour closed at 1.46 million yuan, and Laoche flour at 1.465 million yuan. Lilang yangfen has lacked transactions for a long time. Yesterday, 70 pounds opened at 2.08 million delivered. Although large-package wheat bran initially rose, it was flat at the close. The factory price of wheat was 2.15 million.</p>
<p>Coarse Grains</p>
<p>All rose in unison. After the rice price rebounded, coarse grains followed suit. Soybeans rose by 90,000 yuan. Corn was firm and soft, and opened 50,000 higher yesterday but weakened at the close. Red sorghum rose by 50,000-60,000, red beans rose by 100,000, and selected green beans rose slightly. Sesame customer groups returned to the market, rebounding by about 100,000. Raw peanuts were absorbed by the Guangdong Gang at low prices, rising sharply by 400,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Cooking Oil</p>
<p>Rose along with other commodities. The factory did not open prices. Soybean oil transactions were all recycled orders, with Dayou soybean oil being the most popular. It closed at 7.2 million yuan, an increase of 280,000 yuan compared to the previous day. The market had less raw oil inventory, and cargo owners held on even more strongly. Qingdao Jitu brand raw oil opened at 8.6 million yuan, an increase of 300,000 yuan. Raw sesame oil rose 300,000 along with raw oil. Soybean cake initially followed the firm trend of the previous day's close, rising by 20,000-30,000 yuan as both oil and soybeans rose. Later, a large number of recycled goods were released, slightly lowering the price, and ultimately rising by 20,000 yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e158">Tea Market Remains Prosperous <a href="#e158" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c158" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">158</a></h3>
<p>The tea market trend remained exceptionally prosperous yesterday, and the rising wind spread, making it difficult to expect lower prices in the short term. Holders, seeing that inventories of various goods remained depleted, did not quell their hoarding intentions. The process ultimately led to a step-by-step increase in prices under these circumstances. However, transactions ultimately lacked full volume due to the failure to adjust the intake and output. According to industry insiders, tea sales have been quite strong recently. In particular, after foreign sales of green tea, the Xinhua and other tea companies in this city have a better appetite, but it is a pity that the supply is out of balance, making it difficult to satisfy the desires of those who seek it.</p>
<h3 id="e159">China Trust Actively Promotes Frozen Egg Exports <a href="#e159" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c159" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">159</a></h3>
<p>The long-silent frozen egg export industry is now being actively promoted. It is estimated that within a month, China Trust Bureau can purchase 705 tons to be shipped to the UK, each ton worth £210. Based on the current price of fresh eggs at 4.9 million to 5 million yuan per municipal dan, with 25 dan making one ton of frozen eggs, plus considerable labor, electricity, packaging, and other costs, the person in charge of Mao Yu Company, a frozen egg company in this city, has recently contacted China Trust Bureau several times. They can accept the purchase price of 163 million yuan per ton offered by the Bureau, and a contract can be signed soon. China Trust Bureau believes that overseas market prices cannot be expected to be high, and even based on the recent foreign exchange calculation, the national treasury still needs to subsidize 10% of the losses.</p>
<h3 id="e160">Taiwan Sugar Tight <a href="#e160" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c160" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">160</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market saw Taiwan sugar rise again because the exchange rate of Taiwan currency rose by another 7 yuan to 202 yuan. Spot goods: 24 group white was 4.92 million to 4.95 million yuan, up 250,000 yuan. Four-half white high goods were 5.1 million yuan, up 100,000 yuan. Taichung sand white was 4.42 million yuan, up 170,000 yuan.</p>
<p>The trading of warehouse receipts fluctuated greatly, with ups and downs of more than 200,000 yuan. The added payment for the 11th period was 1.1 million to 1.08 million yuan. The Saturday payment was initially 1.3 million yuan, once returning to 1.06 million yuan, and rising to 1.24 million yuan in the afternoon. 12th period coarse white was 1.25 million yuan, combined red was 1.04 million yuan, medium sand white was 1 million yuan, and four-half white was 1.33 million yuan. Taiwan sugar was sold as usual, with flower packages of four types: coarse white, cotton white, medium sand, and Taiwan red. The package prices remained unchanged from the previous period. Soil sugar was more sluggish in North sales, with a poor appetite. Transactions were sparse and the trend was soft. Shantou green was 3.1 million yuan, Xinghua white high was 4.6 million to 4.55 million yuan, Xinghua red high was 3.1 million yuan, Diaoqing was 2.95 million yuan, and Hainan red was 2.4 million yuan. Only 300 pieces were opened in total.</p>
<h3 id="e161">Northern Coal Transportation Smooth <a href="#e161" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c161" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">161</a></h3>
<p>[Our Report] According to the person in charge of the Fuel Management Committee, the northern transportation channels are smooth, and coal transportation is gradually returning to normal, so there is no problem with the supply in this city. However, due to the smaller number of ships, there are currently 65,000 tons of coal in Huangqin Island and 28,000 tons in Keelung waiting to be transported, and they are currently trying to allocate ships.</p>
<h3 id="e162">Chinese Stocks Weak in the Morning, Firm in the Afternoon: The Market is Expected to Rise Again <a href="#e162" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c162" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">162</a></h3>
<p>Chinese stocks were weak yesterday morning and firm in the afternoon. Jinglun and Hengfeng rose to the limit, and Yongsha was sold off by many parties. The previous market saw a tragic decline. Stimulated by Hong Kong Electric and Telecommunications, the market stirred again in the afternoon, but it was difficult to maintain, and the trend was vague.</p>
<p>The market opened slightly weaker in the morning. Yongsha opened at 1,765 yuan and 1,950 yuan for immediate delivery and forward delivery, respectively. It initially rose to 1,790 yuan and 1,960 yuan, then fell to 1,740 yuan and 1,920 yuan, and then pulled up to 1,775 yuan and 1,953 yuan. The spread for forward delivery was pulled higher and higher, retreating to 1,720 yuan and 1,910 yuan. No. 99 and other numbers were delivered, and No. 190 and others bought for immediate delivery, rising to 1,750 yuan and 1,945 yuan. This was because external funds stirred again. However, as prices soared, stock sellers were extremely anxious. There were more sellers than buyers, and maintenance was lacking. The decline was very sharp near noon. No. 235 and others sold for forward delivery, and No. 179 and others sold for immediate delivery in concert. Yongsha fell to low prices of 1,630 yuan and 1,850 yuan. The booming Jinglun, Xinhua, and Guohuo also returned from strong to flat. With the maintenance of No. 71 and others, Yongsha closed at 1,648 yuan and 1,875 yuan in the afternoon. Except for Jinglun rising by half a percentage point, Datong and Xinyi were flat, and Yonggong rose to the limit and then retreated, rising slightly, Zhabei, Huochai, Qinxing, Neiyi, Zhongfa fell by 10%, Jingfu, Xinguang, Zhongsheng, Shangwu, Xinhe, Meiya, Tongyi, and Yongsha fell by half a percentage point, and the rest fell slightly. Due to the premium relationship of forward delivery stocks, Yongsha rose by half a percentage point, Xinguang and Jingfu rose by 10%, and the rest rose slightly.</p>
<p>In the afternoon, Hong Kong Electric contracted further, and external stimulation became more intense. Yongsha opened and immediately rose to 1,720 yuan and 1,920 yuan. The forward delivery immediately rose from 1,910 yuan to 1,780 yuan and 1,970 yuan. No. 224 and others sold for immediate delivery, and No. 60 and others sold for forward delivery, retreating to 1,760 yuan and 1,943 yuan. Jinglun and Hengfeng rose to the limit. No. 9 and others bought for immediate delivery, No. 143 and others bought for forward delivery, and Ma Qingzhu first cited news from Europe. Yongsha rose to 1,810 yuan and 1,990 yuan. No. 105 and others sold for forward delivery, and No. 160 and others sold for immediate delivery. The National Bank made a difference and retreated, but No. 95 and others replenished and stabilized, No. 61 and others closed immediate delivery one after another, and No. 69 and others supplied forward delivery, and the market closed retreating to 1,775 yuan and 1,960 yuan. After the close, No. 190 and others continued to sell, continuing the downstream trend. As a result, compared to the morning close, the immediate delivery stocks Jinglun and Hengfeng rose to the limit, Yongsha, Zhabei, Xinhe, Xinguang, Yonggong, Zhongfu, Lian, Neiyi, Zhongfa, Guohuo, Xinhua, and Huaxin rose by half a percentage point, Qinxing rose by 10%, Datong fell slightly, Xinyi was flat, and the rest rose slightly. The forward delivery stock Xinhe rose by half a percentage point, and the rest rose slightly. The situation of unlisted stocks outside the market was stable. Zhonghua and Nanyang rose slightly.</p>

<p>[Shenzhou News Agency] Regarding the purchasing price of tung oil this week, according to the China Trust Bureau, tung oil merchants in this city have raised the price per dan to about 7.8 million yuan due to the adjustment of the foreign exchange base price the day before yesterday (the 17th), which is improper. The China Trust Bureau's purchasing price this week will still be based on the original price of 6.5 million yuan. It is hoped that general oil merchants will recognize that the adjustment of the foreign exchange base price is to encourage exports and is not to raise domestic prices, and actively apply for purchases.</p>

<h3 id="e167">New Treatment for Post-Illness Limb Paralysis <a href="#e167" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c167" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">167</a></h3>
<p>— Liang Junqing</p>
<p>The progress of modern science is gradually tending towards seizing the power of creation and surpassing the ingenuity of nature. Leaving aside the ability of atomic bombs to destroy cities and annihilate the earth, and supersonic aircraft to travel thousands of miles in an instant, the astounding progress in medicine and its tangible benefits to mankind are even more incomparable to atomic bombs and the like. Although the killing power of new weapons such as atomic bombs has shocked the world and left people speechless, their use is limited to one place and one time, which is not as good as medicine that can be used daily to save people and benefit all mankind worldwide. Let me give a few examples to show how great modern medicine is in saving people. For example, diseases like pulmonary tuberculosis, laryngeal tuberculosis, and tuberculous meningitis (commonly known as infantile convulsions) killed countless millions of people in the past, and most doctors have always believed that there was no specific medicine to cure them. However, thanks to the invention of Streptomycin, incurable diseases have become absolutely treatable diseases. Furthermore, diseases such as pneumonia, plague, leukorrhea, syphilis, carbuncles, diabetes, rheumatism, and epidemic meningitis have also claimed the lives of countless millions of people in the past. However, thanks to the increasing progress of modern medicine, these various rare and complicated diseases are no longer a threat to humanity. In addition, conditions such as cerebral hemorrhage (stroke), vascular embolism, and angina pectoris in the elderly, which were previously considered incurable dangerous conditions, are now, although not considered absolutely curable, have their treatment principles fully elucidated, and many people have been cured. As for biological experiments on filterable viruses, cancer treatment, and other research, they are also becoming increasingly sophisticated and approaching the stage of success. From this perspective, the success of medicine in recent years is indeed the greatest among sciences.</p>
<p>Although the progress in medicine has already achieved astonishing results as described above, dedicated medical scientists, biologists, and others are still working tirelessly together, continuously conducting various astonishing and great experimental works in biology. According to recent medical reports, based on years of human biological experiments, it is gradually becoming clear the meaning of human cells in their biological life. In particular, there have been major discoveries regarding the respiration (Zellatmung) of human cell nuclei and cytoplasm. The respiration of the cell nuclei and cytoplasm throughout the human body is significantly related to human physiology, pathology, and the principles of human disease treatment methods. The driving and regulating forces are the three elements of human enzymes (Fermente), hormones (Hormong), and vitamins (Vitamine). According to the inference of the above-mentioned experts, the reasons for human birth, death, illness, and the various responses of external objects to the human body can all be thoroughly understood and used to seek methods of longevity.</p>
<p>Regardless of whether the above theory can become a reality, it has already achieved astonishing success in the research of respiratory enzymes in human cells. According to the report by Dr. Chazitseh of Vienna, Austria, the power of oxidizing enzymes (Oxydase), peroxidizing enzymes (Peroxydase), and catalase (Katalase) can be used to restore the limbs of stroke patients with paralysis and the limbs of children with infantile paralysis to full and normal activity in a very short period of time under certain circumstances. The principles of its treatment are described below:</p>
<p>In the past, doctors believed that the paralysis of limbs caused by diseases, such as the paralysis of infantile paralysis, the paralysis of multiple sclerosis (Multiple Sclerose), the paralysis after stroke, and the paralysis of spinal cord inflammation, were due to the complete destruction of the nerve center, making it impossible to treat. In fact, this is not the case. This dogmatic theory has ceased to exist due to the progress of modern medicine. If the nerve cells and their nerve centers in the patient's body have not been destroyed, they can be restored to their original function by using "enzyme preparations that promote cell respiration."</p>
<p>According to Dr. Chazitseh, there are two types of paralysis after illness: one is the paralysis phenomenon after the nerve cells and nerve centers mentioned above have been destroyed, and the other is the paralysis phenomenon caused by the nerve cells and nerve centers not being damaged, but only the enzyme regulation function having lost its effect. There is currently no method to treat the first type of paralysis mentioned above, while the second type of paralysis can be treated by applying enzyme ointments that "promote cell respiration" to the patient's skin, allowing it to restore its original function in the shortest period of time (often after a few minutes). This is because their nerve cells and nerve centers have not been damaged, but are only in a semi-anesthetized state where they cannot move. After being stimulated by the above-mentioned enzyme preparations, they can restore their mobility in the shortest period of time. This amazing new method of treating paralysis actually originated from the pathological tissue examination of Professor Prof. Marinescu of the University of Hungary, which is that "the respiratory enzymes (Oxydase) of the anterior horn nerve cells of the spinal cord are completely out of balance in those who have suffered from infantile paralysis, causing the limbs to which they belong to become paralyzed." Based on this experiment, Chazitseh continued to study and advocated the use of this enzyme therapy. After years of research by himself and clinical experiments by many scholars, great success has been achieved. Several examples are attached below:</p>
<p>(1) The four-year-old child of an American officer suffered from infantile paralysis two years ago. Afterwards, his left leg was completely paralyzed and he could not move. The muscles of his left hip were also paralyzed and atrophied, which was very obvious. Repeated treatments in the United States for the past two years were ineffective. So he came to Austria for treatment. After being treated with enzyme ointment 20 times, he was able to walk freely and play with other children. He could also go up and down stairs and jump.</p>
<p>(2) A twelve-year-old child suffered from infantile paralysis five years ago. Afterwards, the shoulder muscles were completely paralyzed and he could not raise his arm. After the first treatment with this method, he could raise his arm above his head.</p>
<p>(3) A fifteen-year-old girl suffered from infantile paralysis ten years ago. Afterwards, her legs were disabled and she could not walk at all. Most doctors believed that there was no hope of recovery. A re-examination before the implementation of this therapy also confirmed that her legs were disabled. Unexpectedly, after the first application of the ointment, her disabled right leg could perform knee flexion and extension movements. However, her left leg was still paralyzed as before. But after the second application of the ointment, the left leg could also perform free flexion and extension of the knee. After seventeen applications of the ointment, she was able to stand up and walk.</p>
<p>(4) A worker suffered from multiple sclerosis in 1933. Repeated treatments were ineffective. In 1939, he consulted a professor of neurology in Vienna, but he was considered to have no hope of recovery and was sent to a nursing home. In February 1941, he was treated with this ointment by a doctor and gradually recovered. In August of the same year, he felt energetic and able to return to work, so he requested to leave the hospital and return to work at that time. In September of the same year, he started to work as an assistant to an army doctor.</p>
<p>(5) A gentleman, 52 years old, had suffered from multiple sclerosis for eleven years, which had worsened in the past three years. He usually had to be supported by a nurse when walking. After the first application of this ointment, he saw immediate results and could walk freely without the need for a nurse.</p>
<p>In addition, it has also been proven to have rapid effects on patients with paralysis after stroke, paralysis of myelitis, and severe hearing loss. Due to space limitations, they will not be recorded in detail here. In summary, the invention of enzyme therapy is indeed good news for those suffering from paralysis. If it continues to develop in the future, its prospects will be even greater. Unfortunately, this medicine is a fresh glandular preparation, which must be prepared and used immediately and cannot be stored. We yellow-faced Chinese people are far away and cannot purchase it, so we can only look westward and eagerly await good news. Therefore, the author has already sent a letter to inquire about the manufacturing method, and the details will be revealed later. However, I sincerely hope that the patients in our country will not be disappointed.</p>
<h3 id="e168">History of Inoculation <a href="#e168" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c168" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">168</a></h3>
<p>— Hua Xinren</p>
<p>The implementation of immunization methods began with "vaccination against smallpox." In this glorious historical record, we can discover the tortuous progress of "knowledge." At the same time, we should eternally praise the achievements of Edward Jenner, the inventor of this great method. In fact, "inoculation to prevent smallpox" has existed since ancient times. However, using scientific methods like Jenner to inoculate to prevent smallpox is unprecedented in history. We know that smallpox was prevalent in Europe in the 18th century, and people died everywhere. At that time, the only thing that medicine could do to help was to use "pus bubbles from smallpox patients to inject under the skin," which could make smallpox patients less severe. This method was called Inoculation. In Europe, this method was once popular and gained the faith of many people. In 1717, Lady Mary Wortley Montagu, the wife of the British Ambassador to Turkey, wrote a description: "Here, every year in mid-September, some old women specialize in inoculating others against smallpox. At that time, residents often notify each other; those who wish to be inoculated gather in groups of ten or so and ask the old woman to inoculate them. The old woman carries a small box containing smallpox pus. First, she asks the recipient where they want to have their vein punctured. After selecting the spot, she uses a needle to pierce the blood vessel and releases the smallpox pus into the punctured vein... not much pain. Eight days after inoculation, the person experiences alternating chills and fever, and about twenty or thirty smallpox pustules appear on the face. After recovery, no scars remain." Furthermore, according to the records of Dr. Maitland, a physician who strongly advocated inoculation at that time: Princess Caroline of England once asked King George I to pardon six prisoners sentenced to death, as long as they were willing to accept the experiment, they would be released. In 1721, Dr. Maitland boldly conducted this experiment. The results were satisfactory, and the six prisoners were pardoned. In 1774, King Louis XIV of France even accepted this experiment himself and did not experience any adverse reactions. Mademoiselle Rose Bertin, the hat maker for Louis' daughter, Marie Antoinette, even made a women's hat in the form of smallpox pustules to commemorate the King's great contribution. The royal family and nobles enthusiastically accepted the "smallpox inoculation method." Of course, the common people were particularly interested and hopeful, believing that there was a savior for the incurable disease of smallpox. Therefore, they were very enthusiastic about the inoculation method. Among those who excelled in this profession, Thomas Dimsdale was very fortunate at that time because he was not only technically excellent and proficient in dialects but also good at writing. The Russian King heard of his name and specially hired him to go to Moscow to provide guidance. Queen Catherine II first accepted inoculation as a model for the people. At the same time, she ordered her lover, Gregory Orlov, and Duke Paul to be inoculated, and the results were remarkable. From then on, not only must all members of the court follow suit, but even the remote rural areas followed suit in a panic. From these records, we know that the community had already been studying this issue before Jenner invented vaccination. At the same time, the community's awareness of "preventing smallpox" had already been established, but at that time, they only knew that it was so, but did not know why.</p>
<p>Once, it was rumored that the disease from smallpox transmitted from cows was much milder than that transmitted from humans. In particular, milkmaids spoke with certainty about this matter and exaggerated their words. Milkmaids had confirmed that smallpox from cows could be transmitted when milking, due to skin damage and contact with smallpox on the cow's body. Milkmaids were immune to smallpox in an intangible way. A milkmaid once told Jenner that Cowpox could prevent smallpox, and smallpox could not damage her beautiful face. Jenner was very interested and paid close attention to this issue. In 1796, Jenner began his experimental work. He took cowpox pus from the hand of Sarah Nelmes, a milkmaid, and inoculated it into the arm of an eight-year-old child, Philip. Philip became the first hero to contribute to scientific experiments. To commemorate this epoch-making scientific achievement, the famous Italian sculptor Montverde created a bronze statue to praise this eight-year-old child. The infinite horror and psychological fear revealed on the face of this first vaccinated patient tested by Jenner were truly vivid. At that time, Jenner did not have much confidence in doing this experimental work, but other than a pustule on his arm, like the cowpox we see today, Philip did not experience any pain. Three months later, Jenner conducted the second step of the experiment, injecting the poisonous substance from the smallpox pustule under Philip's skin again to test whether the efficacy of the vaccination was reliable. The result confirmed that vaccination could prevent smallpox. Based on these experimental results, Jenner completed a masterpiece in 1798, using a rigorous and upright attitude, insightful and decisive intelligence, and wrote a report entitled "For the investigation of the cause and effect of cowpox as it is called by the people of West England." Not only did it awaken people at that time to pay attention to preventive medicine, but it is also a model for us public health officials to strive for today.</p>
<p>After it spread to the United States, the first person to try Jenner's vaccination against smallpox was Benjamin Waterhouse, a professor at Harvard Medical School. In 1800, he vaccinated his seven children. Moreover, he also made them contact smallpox patients. Unexpectedly, these seven children did not contract smallpox. In 1802, Professor Waterhouse again inoculated nineteen children who had been vaccinated with the dirty smallpox virus under the skin. As a result, two children who had not been vaccinated contracted smallpox, while the other children were safe and sound. After this rigorous experiment, it was further proved that "cowpox is a reliable bodyguard against smallpox" (borrowed from the slogan of the Boston Health Bureau). In 1805, the shrewd and capable General Napoleon ordered the three armies to be vaccinated. This was an indication that the efficiency of promoting the invention of vaccination was faster than any other new medical invention. Unfortunately, due to the slow development of science at that time, the opposition still had great potential. Among them, the people in the church opposed it most fiercely. The excuse for their opposition was that this kind of work violated God's will. The opposition even used the propaganda that people would acquire bovine characteristics after vaccination. But facts speak louder than words, and scientific work won the final victory.</p>
<p>According to the May 1947 issue of Life magazine in the United States: In March, a tourist from Mexico City suddenly died of illness in a hotel in New York City. It was later confirmed to be smallpox. The city's health bureau was shocked upon hearing the report, fearing its spread. Mayor Dewey ordered the city's 175,000 wartime air raid warning agencies to issue alarms. The citizens initially thought a great disaster was coming when they heard the alarm. After the reason was announced, collective vaccination locations were designated, and universal vaccination was implemented. In total, 500,000 people were vaccinated in New York City every day. Within four days, it reached 2 million people. Ten days after this incident, the health authorities were relieved because no new cases were found. If this incident happened in Shanghai, I think the mayor and the director of the health bureau would not have been so "frightened." Because smallpox is a common epidemic in our country.</p>
<p>We must admit that since the invention of vaccination, although smallpox has not yet been eradicated, at the very least, we can say that smallpox is not an incurable disease and can be prevented. Therefore, Jenner's achievements are eternally immortal, just as US President Jefferson said in a letter to Jenner in 1806: "Future generations will know from reading history that the most annoying smallpox since ancient times has been eradicated by you, and now there is no one left." Following this example, up to now, we should make efforts to promote vaccination diligently and seriously. But, even if the words are unobstructed, it is still not without obstacles; otherwise, I will vaccinate myself, and smallpox will still be prevalent, what else is there to say!</p>
<p>Junqing's note: Mr. Hua's article describes the support of Europeans and Americans for vaccination, which is truly inspiring. At present, internal strife is frequent, and smallpox is rampant. Even in Shanghai, smallpox is very rampant. Not only does the authorities not have more complete methods to prevent it, but the general public also has a general attitude of indifference. Alas, "If the people do not fear death, why threaten them with death?" Do the people really not know to fear death? It is only that living is worse than death, so they have no time to fear death. Alas!</p>
<h3 id="e169">Q&amp;A on Medical Affairs from Colleagues <a href="#e169" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c169" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">169</a></h3>

<p>(1) Treatment Methods for Dysmenorrhea</p>
<p>Dr. Zhang asked: There is a 41-year-old woman who has suffered from dysmenorrhea for four years. Every time her period comes, she has back pain, lower abdominal pain, sometimes heavy bleeding, sometimes light bleeding, dark purple color, and lots of leukorrhea. After examination, it was found that there were many cysts on the cervix and mild inflammation, which seemed to be a type of membranous dysmenorrhea. Now, I would like to ask what methods can be used for treatment. Is it possible to use X-rays to destroy the ovaries? Or should a uterine scraping operation be performed?</p>
<p>Dr. Wang replied: The symptoms described in the letter are not very detailed, so I cannot give a definitive answer. However, menorrhagia, dysmenorrhea, and tumors of the uterine adnexa can all occur due to uterine inflammation, and this type of inflammation is mostly tuberculous. According to recent research by many gynecological experts, there are many cases of tuberculosis in the uterus and its adnexa (which is closely related to female infertility), which has not been paid attention to in the past. In addition, the symptoms described in the letter can also occur due to endometritis or perimetritis (which, of course, can also be caused by salpingitis or oophoritis). If you can check the patient's medical history and blood test report (such as the amount of white blood cells, the classification of white blood cells, and the Waaler-Rose test results), as well as the body temperature before and after menstruation, you can determine the nature of the cause of the symptoms. If it is a non-inflammatory uterine adnexal enlargement, it can be removed. The excised material can also be examined histologically. As for the method of uterine scraping, it may not be appropriate, as there may be inflammation present, which may lead to a negative result. Moreover, even if the patient has a state of endometrial tissue hyperplasia and grows in other parts (Endometrio is), uterine scraping will not be effective. Where possible, it is best not to use X-rays to destroy the ovaries, to avoid many negative consequences. However, if there is the aforementioned Endometriosis, then this method can certainly be applied, as this disease is extremely difficult to treat, and even if it is surgically removed, it is not easy to succeed.</p>
<p>(2) Methods to Promote Hair Growth</p>
<p>Dr. Chen asked: Are there any methods to make hair that has fallen out grow back?</p>
<p>Dr. Ma replied: According to recent research results, there is still no reliable and effective hair growth medicine. Twenty years ago, there was a hair growth medicine in Germany called Humagsolan, which was once popular, but then became dormant due to its unreliable effectiveness. Recently, the Swiss Roche pharmaceutical factory has advertised heavily, praising its hair growth medicine "Pintin" as a hair growth vitamin, containing pantothenic acid, namely vitamin B derivatives, which can turn gray hair black, regenerate hair loss, and is based on various chemical tests and clinical reports. Of course, this kind of hair growth element based on vitamins has its theoretical value, but according to personal clinical experiments, its effect is not very obvious. It seems to be far from ideal and still needs to be researched. As for the early stage of baldness, it is hereditary. If it is a general hair loss, it is related to endocrine disorders (namely, the common people call it kidney deficiency), and seborrhea (Seborrhoe) in the scalp is also very relevant. Ultraviolet irradiation of the scalp seems to have a hair growth effect, but its success is very small and it does not last long before the hair falls out again. I think that if the seborrhea of the scalp can be cured, many hair loss situations can be improved except for hereditary ones. As for taking arsenic preparations internally, I have not seen it be effective.</p>
<p>(3) Treatment for Seborrhea of the Face</p>
<p>Dr. He asked: During clinical consultations, young people often come to ask about the cause and treatment of seborrhea of the face. I knew it at the medical school but not in detail, so the treatment was sometimes effective and sometimes not. I wonder if modern medicine has progressed and there are newer theories and treatments?</p>
<p>Dr. Wang replied: Seborrhea of the face is only a local phenomenon. It can also occur in the scalp, ears, neck, and chest. The causes are very complicated. Some are caused by excessive sebum secretion, some are caused by endocrine disorders, some are caused by metabolic disorders in the body, some are caused by abnormal food intake (such as eating too much oily food or eating too much chocolate candy), and some are caused by Flaschenbacillus, etc., all of which are direct or indirect causes. Seborrhea of the face often occurs in conjunction with acne, which must be known. The treatment is best with X-ray irradiation, but it must be performed by an expert and started with the smallest amount. If the dose is too high, it can destroy the main tissues of the skin and cause great harm. Some predecessors used endocrine hormone therapy and saw results. However, the required dose varies from person to person, which is very difficult to measure. Some doctors often fail to obtain the effect due to inaccurate dosage, so they abandon it and do not use it. If the patient has a cause of abnormal food intake, then the treatment must, of course, start from controlling the diet. Sometimes using artificial sun lamps or ultraviolet irradiation is also very effective. As for the local aspect, applying 1-3% salicylic acid preparations or 2% sulfur preparations (such as aqueous solutions, powders, or ointments) may be helpful.</p>

<p>— Editor</p>
<p>The news of Dr. Fan Shouyuan, a stalwart in our medical community, successfully running for National Assembly delegate has been officially announced in the newspapers in the past few days. This is something we should celebrate. Because Dr. Fan has selflessly dedicated himself to our medical association for the past two years, making his greatest efforts. He has connected the feelings of our medical community, bridged the gaps within our medical community, tried to develop the affairs of the medical association, and strived to eliminate disputes among members. He also used his position as a city councilor to fight for the rights and interests of our doctors in the City Council. How could someone who seeks the welfare of the public without shirking hardship and resentment not be supported by us? Therefore, he received the most votes in this election for representatives to the National Assembly. This is truly what everyone expected. Now that he has been formally elected as a National Assembly delegate, he will certainly continue to use his extraordinary talent in his position as before. This does not need any further addition from us. Well done, Dr. Fan! We celebrate your success, which is also the success of our medical community.</p>

<p>— Pingzhai</p>
<p>Before the war, a ten-dollar bill could buy a picul of rice. Now, no one would even pick it up if it were dropped on the ground. If you used a ten-dollar bill to light a cigarette, it would probably be cheaper than using a match.</p>
<p>A few days ago, when I hailed a rickshaw, I saw a thousand-dollar bill on the seat cushion. I told the rickshaw puller that there was money on the seat. Four or five rickshaw pullers standing nearby all gathered around to look. When they saw it was only a thousand dollars, they all burst into laughter. In the end, the rickshaw puller I hailed stuffed it into his pocket, but I heard his companions making fun of him: "What a disgrace!" "What a big appetite!"</p>
<p>It seems that picking up a thousand-dollar bill is already an "embarrassing" thing.</p>
<p>At the same time, everyone taking the tram feels the trouble of making change, especially now that there is a one-level fare of six thousand yuan. Both passengers and ticket sellers feel a headache. It is certainly not acceptable for passengers to pay five thousand yuan, as that would be "cheating," and the ticket seller would definitely not be polite. But if you pay ten thousand yuan and ask for change, the ticket seller often does not have that many one-thousand-yuan bills. As a result, most people naturally accept the ten thousand yuan, give you a six-thousand-yuan ticket, and say "Thank you!" Many passengers do not care about the four thousand yuan change anyway, and gradually become accustomed to it.</p>
<p>However, some passengers feel that they have been taken advantage of, or that regardless of how small the matter is, it violates the principle of integrity, and they inevitably argue. This usually begins with the passenger's face turning red and ends with the ticket seller's sarcastic remarks.</p>
<p>Thus, every Shanghainese feels a kind of contradiction: when going to the bank to withdraw money, they fear that the bank will give them "bad bills." If you want to withdraw ten million, and they give you bills with a face value of only five thousand yuan, you may already feel impatient. If they give you bills of one thousand yuan or even five hundred yuan, then no matter how good your usual self-cultivation is, you cannot help but lose your temper and say that the bank clerk is deliberately working against you. When receiving money, for the sake of convenience, the face value of the bills is feared to be too small, and the bills are feared not to be new enough. But on the tram, you fear that your pockets are full of brand-new five-thousand-yuan Customs Gold Unit bills, because making change takes time, and sometimes it will cause you to miss your stop.</p>
<p>I have a classmate named Li, who studies literature and has a particularly rich imagination. He often likes to fantasize about the history of those tattered banknotes. He often says: "Maybe this bill was once held by a beggar covered in sores; maybe it has been in the hands of someone with leprosy... How terrible, how terrible!" So he always keeps an empty glass bottle containing aspirin pills with him, and the surface of his clothes is full of alcohol. Whenever he inevitably receives a slightly worn banknote, he always pours a little alcohol into his palm and quickly rubs the fingers that touched the banknote in the alcohol, saying it is "disinfecting." However, he always carries some of those small bills that he considers terrible, because he hates wasting time. Whether buying things or buying tram tickets, whenever there is a fraction, he must make it up to the exact amount, and then happily leave.</p>
<p>In fact, customers like Mr. Li are certainly welcomed by all stores or honest ticket sellers, because they are straightforward and the transaction is done smoothly. However, there are probably not many people like Mr. Li in the world, especially in Shanghai, there is probably only him alone. Thus, the problem of making change, a problem for most Shanghainese today, remains unresolved.</p>
<p>But the headache of the change problem is not unique to China. Foreign countries also have it, and this "foreign country" is actually the most opulent America.</p>
<p>In the few years after 1860, America experienced a major shortage of change. Various companies and businesses automatically manufactured some "token coins" (which were coins, not the "token vouchers" that appeared in wartime Shanghai). The company's brand name and address were printed on the token coins, and the other side was printed with words such as "a loaf of bread" or "a bottle of beer." More than ten thousand stores used these "token coins," and at least twenty-five million "token coins" were in circulation. But in 1864, the owner of a bar in New York actually refused to redeem them after issuing twenty thousand beer token coins! As a result, the owner was of course arrested, and the American government also promulgated a law prohibiting private minting of any currency. "Token coins" then disappeared and became a historical term.</p>
<p>But what really solved America's change shortage was not any legal force, but the American government's complete overhaul of the issuance amount of coins. When there are more "dimes," making change is no longer a problem.</p>
<p>Perhaps it is still too early to talk about reforming the currency system today, but if we are not reforming, then when we do reform, we should really let our pockets often hear the clinking sound of "dimes" colliding.</p>

<h3 id="e173">Old Stories of Peking University <a href="#e173" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c173" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">173</a></h3>
<p>— Jiefu</p>
<p>I recently read an article in the "Free Discussion" section of the Shen Bao written by Ling Xiaohange, "Friends of My School," discussing the past of Peking University. It is truly comforting to learn some details from this, as I have not heard from old friends for decades. I was in the same class as Ling Xiaohange. I have been working in the engineering field and sometimes feel happy enough to pick up a pen and publish articles. My old friend probably still remembers the name "Jiefu" from the early Republic of China. When we talk about the past of "Peking University" today, it is like a white-haired palace woman of the Tang Dynasty talking about the relics of the Tianbao era. Ling Xiaohange's account still has omissions, so I will add one to respond and inform the alumni of Peking University.</p>
<p>When the Qing Dynasty first established Peking University, it set up four departments: Shixueguan (Literary Study Hall), Jinshiguan (Scholars' Hall), Shifanguan (Teachers' Hall), and Yixueguan (Translation Hall). The first two halls were set up for those who passed the imperial examinations to make up for their lack of modern learning. Mr. Ye Yu-fu (Gongchuo) was a student of Shixueguan, and Mr. Guan Ying-ren (Genglin) was a student of Jinshiguan. Shifanguan was set up to prepare teachers for establishing schools, and Yixueguan was to cultivate talents for translating Western books. Yixueguan had many handsome young men, and was known as the "Xianggong Tangzi" (Elegant Gentlemen's Hall) at the time. Wu Jinglian, the speaker of the first National Assembly of our country, and Zhu Zhaoxin, the former special envoy of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Guangdong and Guangxi, were both students of Shifanguan. Mr. Gu Mengyu was a student of Yixueguan. There were many others who held important positions or were well-known at the time. These are just a few examples casually mentioned. Later, in preparation for establishing a university with specialized departments, a university preparatory course was first set up, and students were recruited from various provinces and sent to Beijing to study. I was one of the twenty-four preparatory students from Guangdong Province at that time. At that time, there were very few talents in modern learning in the country, so most of the professors in other subjects besides Chinese Studies were foreign, from England, America, Germany, France, Russia, Belgium, Japan, and the Netherlands. It could almost be called an international school.</p>
<p>The head of the university was not initially called the president, but the "University Superintendent," with the rank of a third-grade Beijing official concurrently serving in the position. The position was quite high, and those who held this position were all well-known figures. I remember that Mr. Yan Jidao (Fu) once held this position. Yan had a foot ailment. Every time he arrived at the school, he got out of the car at the gate and then rode in a two-person sedan chair to the superintendent's office. He also smoked opium. The students criticized him for being old and corrupt, and created a cartoon of someone smoking opium, published in the newspaper, titled "Smoke Recovery." Yan was embarrassed and soon resigned. He was succeeded by Mr. Ma Xiangbo (Liang), who was nearly eighty years old at the time. The students thought he was too old, and sent several representatives to see him, telling him: "Peking University is not easy to run. Mr. Yan has already retreated because he found it difficult. You are so old, why bother looking for trouble? Wouldn't it be better to rest at home? If it's for the monthly salary of three hundred yuan, that's easy to solve. We students can pool three hundred yuan a month and send it to you!" Old Mr. Ma laughed and said repeatedly: "Bring it to me! Bring it to me!" Ma was quite humorous and eloquent. The next day, he summoned the students for a speech, saying: "What is called a university is not because the school's buildings are big, the students' tempers are big, or the principal's age is big (what else is big, I don't remember clearly), but it is because of how it should be to be worthy of being called a university," and so on. But Mr. Ma did not stay in his position for long, resigning after a few months, which shows that the sharpness of Peking University students did not begin with the May Fourth Movement.</p>
<h3 id="e174">Lincoln Polishing His Shoes <a href="#e174" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c174" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">174</a></h3>
<p>— Gonghua</p>
<p>One morning in the White House.</p>
<p>Secretary of State Jim was led by a messenger to a large living room to see President Lincoln on official business. As he walked down the corridor, he saw a man beside him who was constantly polishing his shoes. Jim inadvertently looked down and stopped in surprise.</p>
<p>President Lincoln was constantly polishing his own shoes.</p>
<p>"Your Excellency, as President, doing such a thing is not very elegant when seen by others, especially by noble ladies..." Secretary Jim usually heard people say behind his back that the President often showed crude manners like a country bumpkin, and he blurted it out today.</p>
<p>Then Lincoln smiled and looked at Jim's surprised eyes; "Ah! Is polishing shoes a shameful thing? Mr. Jim! That is not right. The President and the shoe polisher are both public servants working for the world. There should be no lowly occupations in the world, only people with base hearts."</p>
<p>Lincoln said loudly, and with hands still stained with shoe polish and other smells, he took the important official documents brought by Jim and began to read them with the same enthusiasm as when he was polishing his shoes.</p>
<h3 id="e175">Anecdotes of Einstein <a href="#e175" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c175" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">175</a></h3>
<p>— Leng Leng</p>
<p>The father of the theory of relativity, Einstein, was slow, shy, and spoke incoherently as a child. His parents worried that his talent was not as good as ordinary children, and the teachers in school shook their heads in despair, calling him a dunce and thinking that he was hopeless and uneducable. Who knew that such an incredibly clumsy child would be recognized as one of the most outstanding intelligent giants of our time, one of the greatest thinkers of ancient and modern times, sixty years later?</p>
<p>Einstein regarded fame, wealth, and luxury with extraordinary indifference; it is said that once, the captain of a ship on the Atlantic Ocean, in order to treat Einstein well, specially gave up the most exquisite room on the ship to wait for him, but he was severely rejected, unwilling to accept this special treatment, and preferred to sleep in the lowest-class steerage. When he was hired by Princeton University in New York, USA, to go to lecture, in order to avoid the trouble of interviews with reporters, he instructed his friends in advance to secretly pick him up by barge halfway before the ship arrived at the port and transfer him to a car to drive to the school.</p>
<p>Currently, at least nine hundred books have been published explaining Einstein's theory of relativity, but according to Einstein himself, only twelve people in the world can truly understand his theory of relativity, and his wife is also an exception.</p>
<p>Einstein once used a simple example to explain relativity; a beautiful girl sits with you for an hour, and you feel like it is only a minute; if you sit alone by the stove for a minute, you feel like it is an hour. - At first, it seems to make some sense, but it is actually relativity.</p>
<p>According to Einstein's wife: her husband is very willing to abide by order in his thoughts, but in real life, he is willing to adopt casualism, unwilling to be bound by order, and wants to do whatever he wants to do whenever he wants to do it. He has set two rules for himself; one is that no matter what "rules" are, he does not want them, and the other is that he is not controlled by anyone's opinions.</p>
<p>But sometimes he has to violate the second rule when he meets his wife; for example, when she invites friends to a tea party at home, she wants to ask her husband to participate in their grand meeting, but Einstein often answers harshly: "No! No! I can't go! I can't go! I can't stand such harassment, which makes me unable to work in peace, I want to leave this place immediately!"</p>
<p>Einstein's wife is really patient, waiting for him to finish his anger, and then uses a few good words to make him obediently follow her downstairs to participate in their tea party.</p>
<p>Einstein's daily life is very simple. He usually wears a set of untidy old clothes, does not like to wear a hat often, and often whistles or hums songs in the bathroom. Although he intends to solve the complicated mysteries of the universe, he believes that he cannot make the enjoyment of life too complicated, so when he shaves after bathing, he does not use shaving soap but uses bath soap, because he thinks two kinds of soap is really a waste.</p>
<p>There are really many anecdotes about Einstein, let me tell one more to end it! One day, he argued with a ticket seller on a bus in Berlin, because he thought the change was wrong. After the ticket seller recounted the change, he realized that Einstein himself was wrong, so he returned the change to him and said a humorous sentence that was almost mocking our great mathematician and thinker: "This time the mistake is because the gentleman cannot count!"</p>

<h3 id="e178">The Collector's Seal <a href="#e178" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c178" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">178</a></h3>
<p>—</p>
<p>"Collecting" is considered the most sympathetic of all hobbies. Books, paintings, card versions, bronzes, porcelains, everything enriches knowledge, broadens horizons, and nourishes the spirit, which is more brilliant than wild dancing, gambling, and the plays of eroticism, pornography, blacklists and whitelists. However, it also requires a kind of wisdom to control and balance it. If you are too obsessed or enter the realm of madness, it will not be beneficial, but will be a burden, unable to broaden your mind, but instead blocking your intelligence.</p>
<p>In the early years of the Daoguang period of the Qing Dynasty, Hanlin Sun (Yuanxiang) of Changshu wrote a preface to Qian Meixi of Jinkui's "Shu Tan," saying about "collecting": "It is generally like clouds and smoke passing by. Qian himself also said in a book: 'Collecting is an elegant matter, originally like clouds and smoke passing by, which can pass without staying. If you are greedy and covetous, it will turn elegance into vulgarity. Look at the collectors of ancient times, none of them have passed it down to their descendants for hundreds of years who can still keep it!'" The words are extremely insightful.</p>
<p>The words "collecting" and "passing by" seem contradictory on the surface. Since it is regarded as smoke and clouds passing by, why bother to collect it tightly? Therefore, Qian said: "Gao Jiangcun already said that people exhaust their resources to engage in collecting, which is no different from risking their lives to seek wealth and glory. And there is also a small seal that says: 'Jiangcun's thirty years of effort gathered.' It can be seen that he loves it deeply and is deeply addicted to it, and may not be able to regard it as clouds and smoke passing by." In fact, hobby is a mood, and collecting is a natural fact, which is not contradictory to "optimism." Mr. Qian himself was a great collector, and at the same time an optimist.</p>
<p>Yuan Hanyun of Xiangcheng was an accomplished man of literature and art, and loved antiquity as if it were his life. He had a large and exquisite collection of items, and his versions were much richer than those of his friends. He once engraved a seal with the inscription "May descendants always treasure it." Later, he felt that his hopes were too extravagant, and changed the seal to "Exist and perish with the body." It can be said that he was extremely saddened, but it was only a temporary emotional effect. Later, he lived in extreme poverty in Tianjin, and he could not avoid selling his beloved items for money. Then the descendants would certainly not always treasure them, and the individual would sometimes find it difficult to coexist with them. Therefore, what his seal expressed was only his own deep infatuation at the time.</p>
<p>Hanlin Ye Juchang of Suzhou spent his life searching for rubbings of steles and various rubbings. His Ruyuan Diary was never without some "post sellers" and "stele appraisers." In the year of Bing Shen, his only son died of illness, and he was endlessly saddened, saying that "the family heir has died, and the pillars of the hall have no one to rely on," and also saying that "the old paper in the box, I don't know whose hands it will fall into in the future!" He also said: "Who will collect and organize my life's painstaking searches in the future? Speaking of it makes me even more sad!" It seems that old Mr. Ye also hoped that "descendants would always treasure it." If a person has no descendants, the legacy will eventually be scattered. Two years later, the son of the deceased Hanlin Huang sold his father's treasures to Liulichang. Old Mr. Ye sighed and wrote down a few words: "Huang Benfu came to talk, and reunited the legacy with 2,800 gold to return it to the factory. If a son can read, he still cannot keep it. We can see through the illusion!" So he suddenly realized.</p>
<p>It turns out that the saying of preserving for generations originated in feudalism and was advocated by emperors. The imperial jade seal in history, as well as the words "eternal treasure" engraved on palace tripods and bells, can all prove the same meaning as the so-called "passing it down to all ages" and "the country's destiny is boundless."</p>
<p>Collectors often prepare some seals with the inscriptions "family collection," "family inheritance," etc., and stamp them on the steles, paintings, and books they collect. As a result, as Qian said and Ye lamented, they will inevitably be scattered elsewhere. Because there are no descendants, or the descendants are unworthy, or there are sons who can read but are intolerably poor, or the times are chaotic, or the cities change, all can break the reality of "family inheritance." Not to mention antiques, even houses, fields, and large mansions change owners and surnames. The emperors always say that they will be boundless for generations, but it is just a good-sounding word, a good-looking pattern. Not only is it impossible in fact, but it is also unnecessary in principle. Good things can be appreciated by everyone. If they are permanently locked in one family and one surname, it is not truly cherishing antiques.</p>
<p>The seals of gentlemen with clearer insights are not like that. They choose the words "Succession and Guarding" to verify that a certain object once belonged to the descendants of a certain predecessor, and they are considered a guardian who "continues to guard" it, and hint that if it is transferred to someone else's hands in the future, they also hope that he can recognize the goods and preserve them, such as Hanlin Li Lianxiu's rubbings, which are stamped with "Lianxiu Succession and Guarding," which is to cherish precious objects, not selfishness, is the succession of responsibility, not the succession of family, is "passing on to the worthy" rather than "passing on to the son," which has the atmosphere of "the world is for all" and the spirit of thoroughly cherishing things. Furthermore, "Once collected in a certain place," and the certain place is the name of the current owner. The prefix "Once" means that sooner or later it will belong to others, and "Once in my hands" is also optimistic. When others get it in the future, they will definitely laugh when they see the seal. He has already said it in advance.</p>
<p>Because of this, in many rubbings, both before and after, and even in the heaven and earth margins, various kinds of inscriptions such as "Someone's collection," "Someone's guarding," "Someone's seen," "Someone's," and "Someone's family" are stamped, which is very lively, and people who buy rubbings are even more interested in this, because it has been proven by many predecessors. At the same time, these seals have become treasures to be researched and appreciated, and the interest in them is perhaps even stronger than the original rubbings.</p>
<p>Qian Meixi also said that collectors are divided into three classes: one is appreciation, the second is good deeds, and the third is profit. Those who seek profit imitate hundreds of times and forge thousands of times to obtain money and goods, which are petty people in the market. According to this, it is the so-called "antique ghost." Imitation, interception, fumigation, its techniques are diverse, but no matter what, it cannot escape the eyes of true appraisers. The first method for identifying the authenticity of old and new is to focus on "charm" and "spirit." Those who "make old" can never compare to "true old," and those who imitate can never mix with genuine products. At the Pingdian Fair in Beiping, imitations of celebrity ink paintings from the Song, Yuan, and Ming Dynasties are available, and the paper, silk, and brushwork are also very good, but the imitation products must have several flaws. If you don't see it at first glance, you will understand it after another look.</p>
<p>In recent years, the cost of living has risen, and old families have released many fine products. Banmeng's letter stated that there are real prices and real things in Shanghai. The first page of a Yuan and Ming manuscript is Song Xue's original ink painting, and someone bought it for 400 million, which is not too expensive (converted to current foreign currency, it is limited)! Liu here has more than a dozen volumes of Song Xue's figure paintings, each with Song Xue's own inscription. Shao Yu's nephew introduced me to see them and asked me to appraise them. After viewing them, the spirit and energy were gathered, and there was no doubt that they were genuine works. An antique dealer has offered ten yellow goods, but the original owner is still unwilling to sell them, which shows how much he cherishes them.</p>

<p>— Chen Shenyan</p>
<p>Chapter Twelve: A Chance Encounter (102)</p>
<p>That evening, Qi Wan returned to the Middle East Hotel. Dao Yun had already returned. Qi Wan didn't reveal a single expression. Upon seeing him, she smiled and said, "You're busy with work. I couldn't wait for you, so I went to see my mother today. My mother was very happy to see me in Shanghai, and she strongly approves of our matter. She only blamed me for not going with you today. I promised her that I would definitely pay my respects tomorrow, no matter what. You must set aside any important matters you have tomorrow and take care of this first. Otherwise, the old lady will be angry!" Dao Yun was very worried when he first heard that Qi Wan had gone to see her mother, but when he heard that Liu Ru had no objections to Qi Wan's marriage, he felt relieved and said, "Of course we must go. I originally planned to prepare everything for us before paying my respects to my future mother-in-law. Now that you've told her, then my planned schedule will have to change. I'll go with you first thing tomorrow morning." Qi Wan said, "That's not necessary. My mother doesn't get up until two o'clock every afternoon!" Dao Yun said, "Then we'll wait until after two o'clock to pay our respects. What gifts should we bring?" Qi Wan said, "You decide that. I won't offer any suggestions." Dao Yun said, "We came in such a hurry that we didn't bring any Beijing specialties. I can't think of what gifts to prepare now." Qi Wan said, "Why bother racking your brains over these things? My mother doesn't care about this. As long as you can please her when you meet her, that's the best thing." Dao Yun said, "I'm sure I can please her. She already likes me. Now that we're becoming relatives, and you're her most beloved daughter, there's no reason why she wouldn't like me." Qi Wan said, "I hope so!" Dao Yun didn't know what Qi Wan meant when she said that, so he didn't dare to ask any further questions. That night passed. The next morning, Dao Yun was busy going out to prepare gifts. At two o'clock in the afternoon, the two of them took a car to Mingde Lane to pay their respects to Liu Ru. When Liu Ru saw Dao Yun, she showed great affection, asking about his well-being and saying that she was very pleased to have this marriage connection. Afterwards, she asked him about his plans for the film production company. Dao Yun knew that Liu Ru had a lot of connections in the Shanghai film circle and that her information was very accurate, so he claimed that the headquarters were in Hong Kong. Although he reluctantly pointed out that many financial backers were helping, his words were not very natural. Liu Ru, who was experienced in worldly affairs, saw through Dao Yun's unreliable words after only a few questions. Immediately, she didn't reveal her true feelings and indulged him with flattery. She kept them for dinner before sending him back. When he was leaving, she secretly instructed Qi Wan to come again tomorrow. Qi Wan, after receiving this signal from Liu Ru, became even more disgusted with Dao Yun.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Tuberculosis Sanatorium, considering that public school teachers have heavy workloads and difficult lives, and if they are troubled by illness and medical expenses, it is unbearable. In order to help public school teachers reduce their burden, the sanatorium has specially stipulated that every Sunday morning from 9:00 to 11:00, during off-duty hours, the cost of taking a chest X-ray photo will be reduced by half, temporarily charging 500,000 yuan. Artificial pneumothorax surgery will be performed, and patients will stay in ordinary wards. The surgical fee will be waived during the hospitalization period as preferential treatment.</p>
<h3 id="e182">This Newspaper's Wuzhou, Guangxi Reader Enquires About a Correspondence School for Poultry Farming <a href="#e182" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c182" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">182</a></h3>
<p>Respected Editor: I am a reader of your newspaper. Before the war, in 1939, I was introduced by your newspaper to the Deyuan Poultry Correspondence School in Shanghai, where I studied the complete course of chicken farming with Mr. Huang Zhongcheng. Since the enemy occupied Guangzhou and then invaded Wuzhou, I have lost seven-tenths of the complete set of books, which I find very regrettable. Now I would like to trouble the editor to inquire whether the Deyuan Poultry Correspondence School, which existed in Shanghai before the Japanese occupied Shanghai, still exists? What is the current address? And the address of Mr. Huang Zhongcheng, and where in Shanghai can his complete chicken farming book still be purchased? I respectfully request a reply! Sincerely, Reader Peng Runbiao, Correspondence Address: Wanxingxiang, Xiaonan Road, Wuzhou, Guangxi.</p>
