<h3>民靑兩黨參加政府事　蔣總統深為關切　張羣雷震先後來滬洽商</h3>
<p>〔本報南京十七日電〕總統關切民。靑兩黨參加政府問題，十七日下午五時召見陳布雷，雷震時，曾懇切表示，在行憲政府中之三黨合作方針，絕不變更，希望與民。靑兩黨協商，在立委問題解決以前，先行參加政府。雷氏並於十七日夜車赴滬，協助張羣與兩黨洽商。</p>
<p>〔本報南京十七日電〕據記者探悉，關於民。靑兩黨參加政府問題，國民黨決仍以全力進行協商，以促其成。國民黨方面之意見以爲値此時局，至盼民。靑兩黨以國是爲重，勿以解決立委問題爲參加政府之先決條件，希望在設法解決立委問題之際，先行參加政府。靑年黨擔任之農林。工商兩部，在左舜生，陳啓天來京就任之前，如能以適宜之人選先行代理，則此一部份政務即不致久懸。政院以外之考試·司法兩副院長，考委，大法官等，係由總統延攬適當人選，提經監院同意後任命，其性質與協商選出之立委不同，故與立委問題不宜混爲一談，此項意見業由國民黨方面轉達民·靑兩黨，並盼兩黨能予考慮，俾打開目前之價局。</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕張羣偕夫人昨日午後四時半乘專機抵滬，呉國楨·吳鐵城·張嘉璈·張君勱等均曾赴龍華機塲歡迎。晚七時，張嘉璈假虹橋鄉下酒家設宴爲張氏洗　。吳鐵城·張君勱均在座，吳市長因另有約會未參加。據悉：張羣此來，全爲解決民·靑兩黨立委名額僵局，須於下週內返京覆命。張氏昨已與張君勱交換初步意見，並與左舜生通電話，約定今晨與靑年黨在滬首要接觸。</p>
<p>〔本報南京十七日電〕司法·考試兩院副院長入選，將延攬民·靑兩黨人士出任，監院副院長劉哲十七日晨曾訪民社黨徐傅霖，就此事有所洽談，徐表示該黨上週中常會內並未討論此事，徐定十八夜車赴滬，出席該黨本週中常會。關於副院長問題，或即將提出討論，記者以大法官人選相詢，徐氏表示，國民黨方面尚未與談，如有所洽商，該黨當可就此有所考慮。</p>
<h3>曾琦發言談話</h3>
<p>〔本報南京十七日電〕靑年黨曾琦十七日發表談話稱：「靑年黨因立委問題未得合理解決，已決定退出政院，業經本黨宣傳部聲明，此乃當然而不得已之舉，因立委名額早有協定，嗣經兩黨代表一再磋商，由八十名减爲四十一名，迄尚無實現之期，並提案聯署之卅名亦不可得，以具有廿五年歷史之政黨如何能以寥寥數人出席會議，立院旣不能出席，政院自不便參加，更談不上考試院·司法院等問題。外傳余將出長一院，總統過去確曾先後直接·間接徵求同意，余以立委問題尚未解決，本人健康亦未恢復仍請總統另選賢能。余之心事可於下列數語見之，即「憲政告成，初衷獲遂，衡山煨芋，聊以全其病軀，嚴瀨釣魚，庶克償其素願」。現聞張羣氏赴滬調解，結果尚難臆斷，余正盼各方對於本黨之退出政府能予以諒解，而勿過驚訝，須知立憲國家亦嘗有一黨執政之事，國民黨如自覺過去成績甚爲滿意，今後危局亦可獨撑，則毅然由一黨獨負其責，吾人亦樂觀厥成，祗有從旁協助，斷不加以牽制。惟有一事必須注意，即天下祗有一黨包辦內閣，斷無一黨包辦之議會，此則立憲體制所關，中外觀　所繫，似仍不可不加以考慮」。</p>
<h3>總統勸出長考院　張伯苓可不再辭</h3>
<p>〔本報南京十七日電〕總統擬提名張伯苓任考試院長，國民黨中常會已通過，而張氏以年　關係謙辭，惟總統對張氏倚畀甚股，將仍勸請出任，據此間一般推測，張氏可能不再堅辭。</p>
<h3>政府向美墨兩國　訂製銀幣說不準</h3>
<p>〔本報南京十七日電〕近來改革幣制之說甚囂塵上，謠訝紛紜。頃據財部息：外傳政府已向美，墨兩國訂製銀幣一節，並無其事。又路透社所傳墨西哥政府將有白銀　華一節，亦屬不確。</p>
<h3>立院財政金融會討論　徴臨時財產稅案　明日續討論起徵點及估值辦法</h3>
<p>〔本報南京十七日電〕立院財政及金融委會，十七日午後舉行會議，召集委會簡貫三主席，進行審查劉不同所提徵收臨時財產稅案，先討論立法原則，決決：（一）名稱仍維原案之「臨時財產稅」，（二）徵收此稅之目的，在理想方面爲平均社會財富，在實際方面爲適應戰亂需要，增闢合理稅源。（三）征收對象除自然人應無例外征收外，法人亦原則均應征收，然依其性質酌定減免優邁辦法，疵點經主席提出後引起激辯，主張法人亦應與自然人相同，一律爲征收對象者，與主張法人應不作為征收對象者，雙方征輪一時餘，旋決定此點原則。該委會定十九日再度開會，籲討論臨時財產稅之稅　起徵點及估值辦法等問題。</p>

<p>〔本報南京十七日電〕監院第四次會議於十七日最九時廿五分舉行，出席委員一二八人，于院長主席。秘書處宣讀第三次會議紀錄後，即進行討論事項。首將監察法草案起草委員會擬訂之監察法草案提出討論。呂超報告起草委會審查通過後，發言者即甚踴躍，均集中於同意權部份之意見，若干　認爲應另列單行法規，不必歸入監察法內；有人認爲四權並列，應在監察法內列出，文字上應有修正等等，旋付討論後決組全體審查會重復審查。並定下午三時開會。旋續討論檢查委會行署組織條例，計草案及前監院之條例共計兩案，旋並有趙光宸郝遇林等四十人之提案一件，亦為有關行署問題者，「請　立本院監委行署組織基本原則，以宏監察權行使之效能案。」當經趙光　說明該案之要點，以時間關係，即宣佈散會，並另推起草委會，將各委會組織法及監委行署組織條例兩案合併交起草案委會討論。</p>
<p>下午三時許，監院舉行全院委員審查會議，出席委員共七十四人，由田烱錦主席。本日未獲結果，定十八日晨繼續舉行全院審查會審查。十七日討論之始，仍以同意權列入與否引起激辯，倪弼爲主張列入最力者，渠認爲同意權乃監察法中之一種，故必須列於監察法內，而多數人均主張另擬行使辦法，認爲同意權非監察權而爲議會權，亦非事先監察權，因此種同意權僅及於憲法規定之小部份官吏，而不及於所有官吏，同意權旣不屬於監察權之一種，自不應列入。旋經表決，仍以多數贊同不列入而另起草行使辦法。繼討論監察法分軍問題，結果爲（一）總則，（二）糾正，（三）科舉，　彈劾，調查，（六）附則。並將糾正權之「權」字删去。本日僅討論至第二章後即散會，未完部分交十八日全院審查會討論。同時推定林式增。谷鳳翔·黃覺·主維祺·田烱錦五委員整理各章節及一章總則之條文，並起草同意權行使辦法草案。</p>

<h3>日本〔經濟復興五年計劃〕的批判</h3>
<p>美政府要求國會撥款億五千萬元，推行日韓及琉球計劃，於本月三日被衆議院否決。這個消息傳到東京後，官員感覺不快，日本人問盟總：「這是表示美國對日政策變嗎？」盟總官員不得不承認，沒有該項撥款，即等於日本「經濟復興五年計劃」的釜底抽薪。美眾院這一決定，雖是日本經濟復興計劃的一大打擊，但還是不能完全瓦解日本整個的復興計劃。</p>
<p>日本「經濟復典五年計劃」，係五月十七日由經濟復興計劃會議公佈的，比屈拉勃報告書的公佈早一天。日本復興計劃公佈後，美國輿論即予以支持，後因英外部官員台寗斯　美，　詢美國對日政策的真象，美輿論爲了避免英國各自治領的駕　，沉默了一些時間。不過美國陸軍次長屈拉勃五月廿六日談話，說「日本已開始經済復興，但任重道遠，非一　可幾。……該計劃欲求成功，日本全國必須較前更加節衣縮食，美國援助不可操切。」美國政府向國會要求的撥款案，是由陸軍部提出的，一億五千萬是首次撥款，其整個數字爲六億七千五百萬。照原來的打算，在一億五千萬元，以一億一千萬元供給日本購買原料·機器皮革·焦煤及其他重要物價，這都是日本復興計劃所必需的工業原料。如果日本獲得這批原料，復興計劃的基金有了，疲滯中的日本工業立刻會活潑起來。遠東各國對美國扶日政策所感到的疑懼，完全可以　是受了這個威脅</p>
<p>按日本的「經済復興五年計劃」，是經濟安全本埠制成的草案，從片山內閣到蘆田內閣，硏擬這項計劃，　時閱歷九各月。參加草擬本計劃的，有如五月十八日東京「朝日新聞」所說：「政府官吏及資本家代表佔　倒的多數，學者不過書名，工會方面只二名。」由此足見本計劃所代表的利益。這個計劃內容分：「經濟復興的目標」·「工礦業」·「食糧」·「貿易」·「交通」「交通」·「復舊建設」。「雇傭」·「國民所得」等八項。經濟復興的目標，是要在一九五二年實現一九三〇—三四年的生活水準，及能够維持此生活水準的日本工業水準。依這個計劃推定，一九五二年日本人口較戰前贈加百分之廿五，達八千二百九十三萬二千人，所以五年計劃所要求的工業生產，必須適應八千三百萬人口的生活水準，而且要它獲得安定與健康。因此，本計劃預定於一九五二年完成的生活水準與工業水準，則有如下表：</p>
<p>晨林水產業于產</p>
<p>生活水準</p>
<p>個人消費支出（每人每年）一一六·〇日</p>
<p>食糧（每人每日）　二·二一一卡路里</p>
<p>衣料（每人每年）　七·四磅</p>
<p>註：本表的金額及金額指數，依據一九一三〇—三四年的平均價格。</p>
<p>依據上表索賠示，以重工業主要部門的石炭與銅塊來說，一九五二年的目標，石炭與鋼塊同爲一四一％，其所持的理由，一九五二年的日本人口較一九三〇—三四年的人口將有增加；人口增加自然是生活水準的放大。即使本計劃對一九五二年人口估計的增加數並非誇大，事實上，較之一九三〇年（六四　·四五〇·〇〇五人）與一九三五年（六九二五四·一四八人）的平均數大六·八五二·〇七六人，也只能一二四％强，不會到一四一％這個比率。又以全體工鑛業生產目標說，如前表所示，對一九三〇—三四年的百分比爲一三〇％，這也頗然超過了一九五二年的假定人口所需的比率。這是說，曾經作為日本侵略的物質基礎的工鑛業，在本計劃中，早已超過了一九三〇—三四年的日本工礦業水準了。高工業水準的情況的發展，尚不僅此，據日商工省相水谷宸三郎說：「屈拉勃計劃如被採納，則日本重工業及電力設備之大部份均可保留，故日政府原　之五年之計劃中一切生產目標，均可於四年內完成。日政府必須徹底修訂其原定之經濟復興計劃，並將所有生產目標提致較高水準。</p>
<p>觀察週來日本輿論，如果美國會通過貸款日本案，這個「經濟復興五年計劃」不僅順利實施，甚且有修改可能，它將發展到沒有水準的境界。出乎意料的，美衆院裁定未准撥款日本案，在日本政府看來，這好像晴天的暴風雨，牠把　田內閣和「經濟復興五年計劃」，從天空中吹打落地。不過，落下來的計劃，依然是可以站起來，騰空而上的，誠如屈拉勃所說：日本復興計劃的實行，「任重道遠」，必需「較戰前更加節衣縮食」，使計劃成功。屈拉勃之愛護日本，可謂無微不至，這確與日本人民堅苦掙扎的情形，完全吻合。要之，今天的日本正學習越王勾踐的精神，「非其身之所種則不食，非其夫人之所織不衣，十年不收於國，民有三年之食。」（國語粵語上）開始復興計劃實行了。「美援」不至，祗不過暫時挫折了　，並不完全瓦解牠的存在。牠的存在和發展，對遠東各國仍存在廣東大的威脅，要取銷這一咸脅，唯一遠東委員會採取有效的步驟，取消日本「經濟復興五年計劃」！</p>

<h3>青島抓丁狂　市民成驚弓之鳥　三犯就地槍決　肺臟外流</h3>
<p>〔本報靑島十四日航訊〕以靑島這樣一個院轄市，十天之間，武裝抓丁事件，竟接連發生，實在駭人聽聞！三四兩日晚上，在東鎭一帶被抓的商販·苦力很多，人數以卡車計，裝上招商局的海有·海桂兩輪·先後開出，不知去向，有企圖脫逃的便打死在海裏，這是記者最初得到的消息，當時碼頭上還有過家屬集體嚎啕的一幕。其後還是有各種不法軍人繼續抓，說是捉逃兵，「市面大有風聲鶴唳，草木皆兵之勢，僻巷夜晚鮮有人跡，甚至日間對武裝軍人亦具戒心。」九日晚個婦女因爲去搶被抓的丈夫，被打死。十一日晚，市中心區的華樂戲院一帶也抓起人來了，聽說又打死人了。</p>
<p>十二日十一時起，「抓兵聲浪，彌漫全市，」靑島市民像聽到了空　藝報，「商店關門，攤販打包，市塲三路，濟南路，北平路，李村路一帶·秩序十分紊亂，人民四處奔逃，如臨大敵。」事後，舉官方說是一塲誤會，記者目擊那時混亂的情形，一片恐　暴　的空氣，一向聽慣了的紀律，秩序這些好字　極　破產了。一家官方通訊社釋電員某君的太太，抱著嬰孩，</p>
<p>坐人力車經過市場路口，車夫聞訊，要緊丟車逃跑，車翻人仰，那嬰孩也鳴呼哀哉了，本地一家報紙說，這「好像是處在一種無政府狀態下。」一家報上標題道：「當局難辭監督之責，山東同胞也太老實。」確是實話。並且索性指明說，抓丁事件「由去冬開始直至目下未停。」</p>
<p>當局無非是爲政府威信和體面著想，鄭重再鄭重，一說是未獲報告，又說是奸人造遙。而軒然大波，無論如何是事實昭彰了。綏區司令部一面綺憲警煙查立禁，並派了幹員督率糾察員到處密緝。十三日上午才在小港交易大棋和東鎭集廠查到了三名小抓兵犯，曹雲貴，費原則，王增富。都是五十四師第七旅的士兵當塲槍決，一個兵彈從背入，當即胸開爆膛肺臟外流。</p>
<p>綏區說，還要嚴懲師長和旅長。這種聲明相信可「以　效尤。」</p>
<p>靑島市有不少地方是特別的，單說物價，除開特區之外，就是全國第一，人民原已在高壓下喘氣，人心浮動，槍聲在市區內是家常便飯，倘有演習，則有砲聲傳到，隆隆不絕，倒嘸啥稀奇。而這種「無政府狀態下」的騷亂，則眞吃不消了。</p>
<p>抓丁的原因：有的說，因爲兵源不敷，部隊不能完全仰仗徵墓來補充的緣故，抓得有理。有的說，因爲要應付點驗，不得不採取緊急措施，彌補一向吃掉的空缺，有其苦衷。有的說，這是個別不肖軍人的生財之道，並且有聲有色地傳出，釋放壯丁一名的市價是一千萬法幣，倘是十名，便是小元寶一只了。</p>
<p>拖到十三日，參議會也有了兩條辦法：（一）請當局釋放被抓壯丁，要求今後保證。（二）被抓壯丁家屬赶速登記，以便按單索人。今天起，市面顯然安定了不少。去冬的大抓丁事件，市民的印象還極深刻，經過幾番曲折，被抓的人才陸續自烟台釋放回來。第八軍李彌軍長發出了「擾民者死」的通告，「抓兵犯」（這是一個新鮮的名詞）也受了懲處。而現在仍然抓來抓去，市民成了驚弓之鳥，「山東同胞太老實」，保陣在那裏呢？（本報特派員邵愼之）</p>

<h3>法議會以十四票之差　批準六國西德協定　責成政府使法獲安全保障</h3>
<p>〔路透社巴黎十七日電〕法國國民　會今晨以三〇〇票對二八六票，通過批准倫敦六國會　建議，設立西德制憲議會及管制魯爾工業產物分配之決議。國會所通過多數黨提出之決議案，除授權政府參加倫敦會議建議案之執行外，並請政府盡力與西方盟國交涉，使法國所提原來建議中未經倫教會議採納之若千點，獲得西方盟國之承認。該決議案承認倫敦會議之建議，顯示英美對法國一再所申明之立塲已有肯定的接近，但法國建議案中若千重要之點，則尚未經採納。該决議案復承認法國如果拒絕倫敦會議之決議案，將使友邦間之合作發生令人遺憾的鬆懈，此等不斷的合作，固爲今日對於和平最確切之保障。該決議案之第二部，責成政府於發現有違背下列原則之任何決定時，應即向議會提出報告：（一）魯爾各礦及基本工業之國際化。（二）　　自德國取得之賠償，其方法中特別應主義者，爲軍事佔領德國時期之延長，及在合約中確切規定盟軍撤出德國之條件。（四）消滅一切極權德國得以復活之危險。（五）繼續探討獲至四強就德國問題協議之可能。（六）加緊從事歐洲之經濟與政治復興。</p>
<p>許曼總理於表決前縱皮社爾外長之後致辭，指出德國匪特不能成爲復興歐洲之助力，且爲盟國之經濟負担，法國對盟國之此種苦衷深爲了解，而德人本身亦已深感不安，故解決辦法之拖延，決不能有所裨益，失去主動力及責任的德人民，務須予以重新組織。國民議會之批准倫敦會議決議，不　使政府之外交政策，包括密切參加西歡聯盟及馬歇爾方案等，已獲得國會之同意。然表決時反對者與贊成者票數之極度接近，顯示大部份法人仍恐懼在西歐聯盟得以充分發揮其效能，法國國防實力得以甫新建立以前，德國已能充份恢復其元氣。</p>
<p>〔路透社巴黎十六日電〕外長皮杜爾今日在國民議會之辯論中，再爲六國關於德國之建議案辯護。渠謂，「在歷史上余尚不知有較倫敦會議的建議更有效的管制。一渠並宣佈法國業已決定同意德國幣制改革，蓋不如此則德境法佔區將不免陷於窒息。渠强調指出法國如僅拒絕倫敦會議之建議，而不提出其他辦法，則其嚴重性殊不容予以忽視。渠確信法國除接　該項建議以外，別無其他途徑可循。</p>
<h3>蘇與西方盟國官員討論　德幣制改革問題　蘇聯頒令增強邊境管制</h3>
<p>〔路透社柏林十六日電〕與蘇聯軍政府有密切接觸之德官員證實，蘇聯官員曾會同西方盟國官員討論蘇聯參加整個德國幣制改革之問題。此項討論純屬硏討性質，故並無四强之重要官員參加。此等談判在柏林進行已有兩日，雖稱之爲盟國之談判，然柏林市府一官員則謂此乃蘇聯與美官員間之談判，討論如獲進展，則柏林盟管會可望於六月二十日恢復開會，討論全國性之幣制改革。德方人士並曰，蘇聯方面業已表示如能有適當的保障，則蘇聯願意作若干讓步。如本屆盟管會主席法軍總司令寇尼許準備於下週一召開盟管會會議，則蘇聯亦願意出席此一會議，不然蘇聯亦將不反對召開盟管會下的財委會會議，以討論幣制改革問題。</p>
<p>〔路透社倫敦十七日電〕據悉，西德幣制改革之實施，已迫在眉睫柏林不在實施範圍以內，同時蘇佔領當局亦於今日下令，宣布禁止持有西方盟國當局所發派司之德人進入蘇佔區，以防利用區間派司，從事非法活動。</p>
<h3>貝文解釋　魯爾問題</h3>
<p>〔路透社倫敦十六日電〕貝文外相十六日在下院　答議員之詢問時，聲明英政府之政策，乃爲決不允魯爾區之煤礦車爲其原來的所有人所得。四强之決議，乃爲魯爾煤礦問題須由德人民處理。根據已住經驗，如由外人經營煤礦，難期有最好的結果。貝文於答　另一議員所詢德政黨對於國營西德企業之問題，採何種態度之問題時，答曰，德政黨有反對者亦有贊成者，社會民主黨與共黨表示贊成，自由民主黨與德意志黨均表示反對，基督民主黨則贊成將主要工業，改於公私共有，英國政府希望比一問題在決定時，得由德國政黨向德人民宣布其意見。</p>

<h3>柏林四強聯合司令會議　蘇代表中途退席　不啻宣告柏林共管制結束</h3>
<p>〔路透社柏林十七日電〕蘇聯代表昨於柏林四强聯合司令部之會議中，中途退席，遂使四强在德碩果僅存的共同合作機構，爲之終止活動。此問英美總部坦白承認，柏林以及德國之四强共管制，業已宣告死亡，恐無再度復活之可能。英發言人則雖承認局勢之極度嚴重，但表示目前如欲揣測蘇聯之行動，是否即爲四强共管制之最後破裂，尚覺過過早。</p>
<p>聯合司令部於昨日開會歷十三小時後美代表霜萊，以過度疲倦，乃請准主席法代表先行退席，不料此時蘇代表團即全體退席，旣未說明理由，亦未向主席致歉。主席遂不得不宣告散會，亦未定下次開會日期。主席並聲明渠之宣佈休會，乃因蘇代表團之全體退席，非爲霍萊之先退，霍萊事後表示，相信此乃柏林四强聯合司令部之結束。但渠並聲明若以爲英美法將被逐出柏林，則恐英美法之意見並不如此。霍萊指出在昨日之會中，原已獲有相當程度的協議，想蘇方必係有意造成事態的嚴重而出此。四强的合作顯然已被以極俄羅斯的方式宣告終止。霍萊繼又鄭重聲明，就西方盟國之立塲言，柏林盟國政府並未因蘇方之行動而終結，四强共管容不能繼續實施，但美國軍政府將繼續執州行其義務，尤其是以糧食接濟美軍區的任務。</p>
<h3>波蘭要求召開　四強盟管會</h3>

<h3>遠東委會英法等八國　商定日工業水準　美竭力反對仍主張提高</h3>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓十六日電〕遠東委員會英，法，菲律賓，印度，澳洲，荷蘭，紐西蘭及加拿大八國，今日商定日本工業水準，但美國仍竭力反對，中國與蘇聯亦不同意。截至目前爲止，局勢甚爲僵持，恐難成立最後協議。依照八國之意，日本工業水準應較斯揣克報告書規定者爲低，美國則主張予以提高，以助日本加速復興。一部份委員認爲此係該會當前最重要之問題。另一一問題，乃日本境內所發現之日軍掠奪物資交還業主問題，中國對此最爲關切，中美兩國聞已進行直接談判。</p>
<h3>蘇澳官方　評美扶日</h3>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓十六日電〕與遠東事務有關之蘇聯官員十六日聲稱，美國正蓄意延宕對日和會以便爭取時間而建造高水準之日本工業。蘇聯代表雖未在遠東委員會中正式作此聲明，然彼等與遠委會若干份子非正式談話時，常流露此項情緒。蘇方人士語合衆社稱，據彼等觀察，美對日態度，幾與英國在上次大戰前對德態度有虎　中郞之似。彼等稱：英國當時自甘寬容德國之重整軍備計劃，其理由爲德闕永不致進攻西方各國，而係用於東攻蘇聯者，現在美國似亦深信，重振後之日本絕不足以咸脅美國在太平洋上之地位，而係對蘇聯遠東地區之威脅。</p>
<p>〔聯合社康白拉十六日電〕澳洲外長伐特今日在下院答復反對派議員批評其外交政策稱：美國復興日本，大部份係美蘇關係緊張之附帶結果。美國在兩年前會同意日本不得有戰時工業，但此種政策現已改變。日本或將爲未來美蘇衝突之一種重要因素，但美國新政策恐將構成澳洲等太平洋各國之威脅，如同第一次世界大戰後之政策，在德國構成民主之威脅。遠東委員會不列顚各邦對於此種見解亦抱同感。</p>
<h3>港華商明日集會抵制日貨傾銷</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社香港十七日電〕日貨在港之銷售，如香港華商一致抵制，則其前途頗爲暗淡。華人製造商協會數週以前，曾向當局要求召集各界大會，成立一東南亞抵制日貨集團，香港政府深恐此項運動展開成爲反美運動，表示此項集會祗能在不用反美字樣之條件下，允許其召開，並不允許發表政治演說，華人製造商協會接受此項條件，定十九日舉行香港對日貨傾銷東南亞之首次有組織抗議之集會。按日貨競爭之威脅，早對香港紡織業發生影響，迄今爲止，上海流港資金之準備投資於工業者，已裹足不前，自滬移此之華人紡織製造商，業已將其開廠計劃置之高閣，而從事於商業活動，直至日貨競爭威脅减少後，再作打算。</p>

<h3>都已交大事件呉市長談話　盼非職業學生趕速表明心跡　如再不屢行將公開傳訊</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕吳市長於昨日下午五時，在市府會議室接見記者，對交大程校畏所稱之處理學生反扶日遊行事件，市府與校方立塲頗有不同一點，有所申述。渠承認市府與校方立塲確有不同，校方採取之態度爲「道之以德，齊之以禮」，而市府採取者則爲「道之以政，齊之以刑」，政策不同，然目標則一。蓋前者應用於大部份善良學生，是爲「安良」，而後者則係針對少數職業學生，是爲「除暴」，故實爲殊途同歸，兩者應該相輔而行。</p>
<p>對於交大學生自治會昨再度致市長之第二件，吳氏昨閱讀後，曾稱「眞好玩」。因信中所反覆提出之質詢，歸納起來無非是：「學生反扶日遊行是愛國運動，你做市長的爲什麼不加愛護反而橫加摧殘？」而吳市長早已再三闡明事實上遊行並非純愛國運動，是陰謀爲實，所以必須加以澈查嚴究。</p>
<p>至於自治會信中所稱傳訊時要求學生旁聽一點（原文爲：你不許同學作證，是不是怕他們當塲說出自己的意思而坍了你的台？）認爲純屬瞎扯，市府所以不准學生旁聽，乃怕學生當庭唱歌擾亂會塲秩序。至於將來傳訊時之公開辦法，市府早已籌劃妥善，如本週內交大仍無答覆，則下週中請市參議會·市商會·總工會·敎育會·地方法院檢察處·警察局·警備司令部·及專科以上各校長舉行會議，公開討論傳訊及傳證人辦法，徵得一致　意後實仃之。</p>
<p>呉市長昨特向交大學生自治會下最後忠告。渠稱：若你們不是職業學生，而純係愛國靑年，則應趕速對全市五百萬市民，及全校同學表明心跡，將市府所提之各項問題迅速作答，渠保證必公諸社會。吳市長最後並稱：我願意借用共黨常引的一句話——「人民的眼睛是雪亮的」。讓全市市民公斷學生反扶日大遊行事件之是非曲直。</p>

<h3>上海傳亦有楊妹無法證明不食　身世迷離不明將作生理檢查</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕本市頃盛傳有一足以與九年不食之重慶楊妹媲美之「上海楊妹」張黛琳出現，渠亦有五年不食之說，但經記者自各方探訪結果，截至目前止，迄無一人能加以證實。渠與重慶楊妹在生活，性格上雖有相似處，然亦有迥然不同者。「上海楊妹」乳高腹陷，性喜摩登，愛好口紅·胭脂·眼皮油·寇丹等化妝品。秀髪披肩，但前黑後紅，頗爲特別。兩眼烱烱有光。渠曾畢業於天津淸心中學初中，能書寫秀麗之鋼筆字·酷愛音樂·樹木，言語時音調甚低，則與重慶楊妹有異曲同工之妙。</p>
<p>言辭矛盾</p>
<p>張女不食消息之所以爲人發現，係因與渠結婚已有三年，現在江海　任督察之張鵬飛，有友爲新聞記者，不久前於談話中吐露所致。旋該記者又將此「上海楊妹」介紹與其父黃麟書（現在社會局任專員之職），據黃稱，認識「上海楊妹」爲時極短，惟首次見面時，張女即呼黃爲寄父，經數日接觸後，黃對張女神經上是否有異，已表示懷疑，蓋黃曾向張女探詢來滬已有苦干年，渠答約有十餘年，旋又詢其不食係在何時開始，渠則答係十六歲，在天津時開始不食，惟張女現年廿一歲，則所答總有矛盾。</p>
<p>居無定處</p>
<p>又張女尚有一神秘之處，即與張鵬飛結婚後，兩人始終無一定居處，前夜張女猶宿於大世界附近之三明旅館，至其過去之身世究係如何，亦屬一不可解之謎團。頃黃已擬於今日起請張女在渠家中小住，俾可加以監護，蓋現黃與張夫婦均願延醫對張女生理上作一詳細檢查也。</p>
<p>見食壓慍</p>
<p>張女昨日上午十一時曾赴黃處晤談，直至晚間九時始離去。據黃語記者：此一日間渠除曾入厠所兩次外，確未進食，當黃等用膳時，渠甚且面露厭慍之色。張女亦曾告黃，其不食之原因，係疑心於葷物之類皆屬死爛者，至素菜本喜食用，但因某次發現菠菜上有小虫一條遂亦深痛惡絕，現每隔二三日僅食香蕉一隻。</p>

<h3>翁仲原是墓道點綴品　不能與佛教混為一談</h3>

<h3>人心轉疲貨主思售　食米價略見回挫　麵粉初疲後堅油市急遽上升</h3>
<p>米市回落，因上日錫市下跌，是以人心已轉疲，加之其他物價，均於上日下跌，米市亦有難以立足之感，故晨開貨主售意甚濃，中下粳秈已普遍應市，惟高貨白粳薄稻仍未見出樣，價格因供應充暢，故下降五六十萬元。早稻　秈已退入限價之內，爲九百七十萬，中檔白　薄稻各做九百七十萬，上白粳薄稻塲外喊價退至一千萬。民調會在南北二市以原價拋出六千石，南市塲配米銷化不佳，原額三千石未銷完。</p>

<p>食油急遽回升，回至前日高峰，因銀根鬆濡，散戶趁低進取，買氣甚盛，廠方不多開出，豆油上漲最厲，大統豆油開市二千二百五十萬元，收市二千四百二十萬，大有豆油收市二千四百三十萬，各見猛漲二百三四十萬元。生菜油亦漲二百萬，生油跌旣不多，昨僅漲五十萬，小車麻油挺百萬，豆餅隨升二十萬，後市緊俏。</p>

<p>新醫與新藥</p>
<h3>關於愛培撤之副作用及其使用方法</h3>
<p>— 梁俊青</p>
<p>自從徐勁醫師在本刊發表了一　文章介紹治療肺結核新　愛培撤（Ebesal）之後，立即引起一般肺結核症患者的注意，紛紛來函詢問，幾乎使徐醫師有應接不暇之勢。雖則徐醫師也曾絡續地發表兩次的答覆，可是來兩詢問的人還是絡繹不絕。這可見我們巾國患肺結核症者之多而且它的「絕對的」治療方法可惜也還在尋覓中了。因爲我在徐醫生的大文內拖了一箇尾巴，說它有副作用，必須由專家使用，方始不致誤事，結果也被讀者們集中地來函詢問。所以我也只好跳出來湊湊鬧熱，發表了這篇文章，我想對於患有結核症的讀者們總匯該有多少貢獻的</p>
<p>不錯，愛培撤對於肺結核　的確有很大的效力，可是它也有它的副作用。只要它用得對，它是非常有效的。假使用得不對呢那末它是有害的。所以我要求使用它的醫師必定要澈底明瞭它的性質方纔可以使用，否則還是以不用爲好。我現在爲了要使讀者明瞭愛培撤的性質起見，不得不兜了一個大圈子，約略地把一切治療肺結核症的方法加以敘述。</p>
<p>自從德國的柯霍氐發明了肺結核桿菌之後，全世界的醫藥專家都在尋覓它的洽療方法。最先是柯霍氏提倡使用結核菌漿苗（即Tubereulin），以爲它可以像種牛瘧或白喉血淸似的百發百中，藥到病除。可是在臨床方面試用之後，結果非常使人失望。不但未見其效，反爾促使許多結核症的患者病勢日益惡化，急劇地　於死亡。害得大家對於結核菌漿苗都是懷疑畏懼，相戒不得嘗試。於是轉移方向，在其他可以想得的一切的方法巾去尋求。例如物理學療法巾之靜臥療法，高山休養法太陽燈照射療法，氣候轉換療法；化學療法中的鈣劑療法，砒劑療法，鐵劑療法，矽劑療法，以及　劑療法；營養療法中之維他命劑療法，改良營養療法，減少食　療法；手術療法中之人工氣胸術療法，肋骨截除術療法，呼吸神經（Nervus　Phrenicus）割出術療法以及細菌學療中之結核菌將水苗Tuberculin.B.C.G.鏈黴素療法等等。包羅萬象，應有盡有，一時不及詳述。雖則其中不少良藥，然而缺點亦非常之多，終究不能算是治療結療結核症之特效藥。於是大家逐漸改良其治療方法，將結核症患分爲二種，一種爲急性，另一種則爲慢性。在急性中以前可以說是除了靜臥以及改良營養之外並無其他良法。自從鏈　素發明之後，大家都以爲它是結核症的特效藥，可是它在某種病情巾是有效的，而在大多數的病例中仍然是毫無辦法。因此，直至目前爲止，在急性的結核症中，我現在還沒有絕對特效的肺結核症的專治藥。</p>
<p>至於慢性的肺結核症呢，那就有很大的商討地方。因爲它的病勢是慢性的，時間可以拉長的，所以有許多的藥都可以把它治好，甚而至於不用任何藥物，只要靜心休養，就可以把它治好了。不過，究竟要用那一種方法去療治它方才比較地有把握呢？那就要我們的慎重選擇了。</p>
<p>原來關於慢性肺結核症的治療問題，不單只是我們醫師要感着頭痛，就是一般病家也有茫無頭緒無所適從之感。爲什麽呢？且聽我道來？</p>
<p>我在上文已經說過，肺結核症變成慢性之後，時間就可以拉長，任何方法都可以把它醫好，甚而至於無藥也可自愈。但是反過來也可以說，任何一種方法也無效用。譬如說吧！目前對於肺結核症的療法中還是以人工氣胸術爲比較地育靠的一種。不過，它的適應範圍也不很大，它只能在初期的或次急性的肺結核症患者方面使用。遇著慢性的肺結核症中往往兼有肋膜炎所遺留之肋膜粘連狀態，此時當然絕對不能使用人工氣胸術，否則可以有肋膜出血的危險，而且事實上肋膜在粘連之後，往往也就無法注入空氣，只好作罷。於是有acobeaus氏提議用外科手術或用電烙的方法去把粘速的狀態剝離，然後再注射入空氣於肋膜內。可惜這種方法只能在非常稀少的適應範圍內方可使用，事實上往往還是「此路不通」的。嗣後有Brauer氏（爲筆者恩師）和Sauerbruch氏提倡用肋骨截除術，使胸腔經過肋骨之裁除術後失去其撐持胸膛之能力，因而獲得「與人工氣胸術相同」之壓縮作用。此法在理論上甚爲成功，事實上也有許多人因此痊愈。可是有許多人或則不能忍受還種手術或則心存畏懼　　不前，或則幸爾　術平安而　疾依然故我，絲毫不見其效。於是大家又回復到鈣劑和維他命BC方面去尋求治療方法。老實說，假使一個慢性的肺結核症患者能够長期大量的注射葡萄糖鈣和維他命BC等劑，同時又能配合著靜臥調養，遷地療養以及改良營養等等方法，那末有許多的息者是可以因此痊愈的。可是，在事實上來說也有許多人照着上述方法去療治而絲毫不見其效的。因此大家又在期待着新的肺病特效藥的到來。自從鏈黴素發明之後大家都寄以以極大的期望。可是它也有許多的缺點：第一它是如此的昂貴，使中產以下的病者無法享受（目前的市價是每管國幣八百餘萬元加以注射手續費等等至少要一千萬元左右而且每管只能用一天，至少須連續注射一百天或一百五十天方可見效）；第二它的效力也不是絕對的（一有許多的肺結核症患注射了許多的鏈黴素也沒有效果）；第三它是每天要注射六次，連續注射一百天或一百五十天，這種運續的痛苦眞是教病者够受了；第四它有時還有頭暈或耳鳴等等的副作用。有了上述的種種缺點再加以金錢方面的損失（至少十餘億元），那我們就可以曉得它不是理想的特效一樂了。</p>
<p>本文所設的「愛培撤」是一種銅質製劑；它之所以用爲治療肺結核癥者，實在因爲意大利有一位醫者於無意中發現「常年在銅器中工作的工人很少患有肺結核症」的事實。當時有一種銅質製劑如Lekutyl就在出售使用。（未完）</p>
<h3>漫談藥學敎育　（下）</h3>
<p>— 黃鳴駒</p>
<p>欲求藥學的發展，必須有高深的研究，而此種研究，必須有充分之藥學院以執行之，一方面造就高深藥學人才，以立定藥學教育之基礎，一方而從事高深研究，以爲華學事業發展之開始。論藥學之研究，大概分爲兩途，一爲化學合成之研究，一爲生藥整理及其成份之研究，我國交通尚未發達，　材出產，多集於西北，西南，而科學設備之供應品，則多流通於東南，故開始之時，對於植物成份之研究，宜在華西，因取材之便利，種植適宜，化學方面的研究，則宜設於華東，華南，因物資，人才，較爲集中，一俟交通建設完成，則化學合成及植物成份的研究，到處皆宜，無分地域區別，預計十年內，至少應有藥學院十所成立，在最初五年內，應有四所成立，其地點在華西一所，宜成立在西安，因爲地近甘，新，康，藏，諸省，藥材出產甚爲豐富，華東一所，宜成立於浙江，因爲該省天合諸峯，以及閩，　兩省的藥材，均爲產藥區域，交通便利，物資轉運較易，同時東北九省及臺灣，就從前日本已有的藥學機構，各成立一所，至於第二個五年，宜遂漸建立之藥學院，則爲南京一所，漢口一所，廣東一所，北平一所，成都一所，昆明一所，以上地點，或爲產藥之區，或爲交通便利，物資易於收集，一俟人材增多，十年之後，推而至於每省設立一藥學院，則將來藥學發展，　　有　望</p>
<p>目前國內關於藥學人才之遝　　，極其矛盾，一方面說，人才不夠有多少事業，或是教育方面，或是研究方面，或是法令執行方面，都說因爲沒有人才，所以不能開始，一方面各華學專科學校，或藥學系，每年造就出的人才，都發生出路問題，因此改行的不在少數，這是何等的浪費人才，我認爲教育部與衛生部，皆應該對於藥學人才有作嚴密之調查，與統計，並相互聯繫，同時一切藥學教育及藥學事業，法令等，都須立刻推動，執行，人才同然不能坐待事業的推動，事葉也不應等待人才再開始，凡是一種企圖，須得要動，方可有望，若用守株待兔的方式，永遠不動，則永遠不會達到目的，況且急切須做的事業，有在這里，人才也有在這里，只須運用一下，便可推動的，同時藥學會對於藥學人才的運用，也應該負起責任來，從事調查，統計，介紹，　　助政府發展藥學敎育，推行藥學</p>
<p>到目前藥學師資方面，確是很少，然而二三個藥學院的師資，並不難羅致，不過要看政府如何運用的方式。據我們所知道的，有很多的藥學師資人才，被外國吸收去做他們的藥學研究工作，甚至於代他們做研究中國藥的工作，這種怪現象，恐怕世界少有，假使政府能感覺到確實需要科學建國，能感覺到過去及現在藥荒的嚴重，能感覺到高深藥學人才的急需造就，能感覺到藥學師資被人家利用研究中國藥爲可恥，毅然的推行藥學院的教育，對於此等師資，優裕其待遇，充實設備，使他們在國內能安心效力，我想這些在國外的藥學師資，都有國家觀念的，尤其在勝利之後，無不雲天企望，早返故鄉，爲國效勞，誰願身處異國，爲人作嫁呢！</p>
<p>綜之藥學教育—藥學院—爲一切藥學事業的泉源，誅伐根底，則一切永無發揚光大之可能，談什麼科學建國，願吾教育當軸，虛心接受我們的建議，願吾藥學同志共同努力。</p>

<h3>送散原先生靈柩歸葬杭州記</h3>
<p>— 陳詒先</p>
<p>陳散原先生靈柩於六月十五日自天津由招商局之錫麟輸運到上海，即移北站，路局備車，將於十六日由隆恪（彥和）方恪（彥通）登恪三兄弟護送至杭州之南山黃泥嶺安葬，寅恪以眼疾留北平清華校，未能南來。十五日午前十一時，余與蒼虬微明兄及祇安病樹兩兄同到北站奠送，在第三號月台，見有白布橫書「陳散原先生之靈車」數字，柩已上車，柩前滿佈花圈。各人行禮後，隆恪兄弟招待至花車上少息，交通部派來之李祖冰，亦隨同照料一切，蓋交通　部長大維乃散原先生之婿也。是日到者，尚有李拔可，陳叔通，葉浦孫及其子葱奇，夏劍丞，張菊生，沈昆三，袁師南諸人。</p>
<p>二十餘年前散原先生夫人葬於抗州之南山，由其墓次，可望見錢塘江一綫，風帆歷歷，其景極佳。其時余侍母居湖　，先生居旗下營白傳路，余介馬卓羣於先生，接洽購地之事，葬時定墓穴及山向者，爲王病山先生，在中央定兩穴，虛其左留爲先生之生擴，衡恪（師曾）則在正穴之下略偏葬焉。先生於二十六年八月中秋前逝世於北平西城之姚家胡同，柩停於長春寺者達十二年之久，今在華北烽火通天交通困難之秋，居然能與其夫人合葬，皆交通俞部長之力。</p>
<p>先生逝世時，距七七日本發動戰爭，不足三月，距八一三上海開火，僅爲一月。報載先生以憂憤時事不食卒，先生以八十五歲高齡，而其熱情激勗如靑年，可敬亦可傷已。陸放翁詩「王師北定中原日，家祭勿忘吿乃翁。」兩年前日本投降，先生竟未親見，真爲遺撼。</p>
<p>先生之詩，商務書館有印本，先生之文，吾友袁伯夔兄有抄本，伯虁兄逝世，其稿由陳病樹兄携去編排，十年以來，紙價排工，漲無止境，暫時無力出版，尚未與世人相見。先生晚年雖以幫文自給，然非其人，則不爲作。曾鞏與歐陽舍人書論墓碑銘，有日：「蓋有道德者之於惡人，則不受而銘之，於衆人則能辨焉，而人之行有情善而迹非，有意奸而外淑，有善惡相懸而不可以實指，有實大於名，有名侈於實，猶之用人，非蓄道德者，惡能辨之不惑，議之不徇；不惑不徇，則公且是矣，而其辭之不工，則世猶不傳，是又在其文章兼勝焉。」光生之文，真可當此言而無愧矣。</p>
<p>先生之卒，由於日寇之侵略。在壯年時，佐其父陳右銘先生於湘撫任內，凡湖南新政，皆先生所區畫，後因康梁之案革職（吏部主事），達終身不出。愛國家，愛民族，而無志士氣，名滿天下，而無名士氣，古文在抱潤軒之上，而未做袁世凱之參政，詩與海藏樓齊名，而未做偽滿之總理大臣，人品高潔，實爲晚近一人。凡初見先生者，必能感覺其容貌恂恂，如一鄉邨老儒，言語和平，毫無岸然氣象，蓋先生之學養深，故與一班名士不同也。</p>
<p>余對於先生，所能言者僅止此，蒼虬兄有挽先生詩，頗能道出先生之生平，茲　錄於後，即以之結束此文：</p>
<p>磊磊蒼松姿，翁爲何世人，王風石狀夢，歷刦一欠伸。棄官非爲高，絕糧不知貧，見人無過差，諧俗無緇磷。純天絕機事，老輩誰等倫，精誠屈騷通，茹仕垂天垠，高風遺世間，使我　千春。（十六日晨八鐘散原先生靈車自北站南開杭州後記此）</p>
<h3>試譯英人勃萊克「虎」詩</h3>
<p>— 鄭曉滄</p>
<p>夜虎伏深林，雙晴晃電炬。是誠何手眼，鑄物威如許？</p>
<p>電炬燭幽谷，俄又騰遠峯。寗復思附翼？誰敢　其鋒？</p>
<p>誰施巧與力，虎心敢挑撥？爾心一撥動，人孰不褫魄？</p>
<p>籌腦洪爐裏，混沌爲之錘。百鍊用何砧？握猛能無悸？</p>
<p>星宿　其矛，淚　諸天雨。造物寗一笑？造羊又造虎？</p>
<p>夜虎伏深林，雙睛晃電炬。大膽真包天，鑄物咸如許！</p>
<h3>談「丈母」</h3>
<p>— 尤墨君</p>
<p>世俗稱妻母爲「丈母」，吳　即有「丈母看女婿，越看越有趣」之語。然丈母亦可作女人尊者之通稱，通鑑載韓　稱劉玄佐之母謂丈母」是。惟柳子原集有祭獨孤氏丈母文，可見稱妻母爲丈母，亦由來已久了。至何以用「丈」字，則本漢書匈奴傳「漢天子，我丈人行也一而變通之。</p>
<p>妻母曰「岳母」，不知何義。一說古詩言「結根泰山阿，謂結姻親故也。泰山是五岳之一，故附會稱妻父曰「岳翁」或「岳丈」或「泰山」，而妻母遂可稱「岳母」或「泰水」了。「泰水」尤不可說，因無這水名！</p>
<p>最適當的，稱妻母可日「外姑」，雖則爾雅釋親謂「舅之母曰外姑」，但舅和姑係對待字，孫爽疏註孟子萬章下「帝館甥于貳室」句云，「禮謂妻父日外舅」，故妻母亦不妨稱「外姑」了。</p>
<h3>精神食糧</h3>
<p>— 鮑忠祈</p>
<p>這兩天米價叩關猛進，市塲起了彼動，一切物價也隨之上升，我們的精神食糧—書報雜誌自然也不能例外，一律增加幾成，甚至幾倍。</p>
<p>最受影響的當然是我們這些讀者，本來袋中藏着一些盈餘的錢，走過書局報攤的時候，還可任意翻閱新出版的書報，看得高興，就揀自己欣賞的買它兩本，帶回家去，手執一卷，或倚窗披閱，或燈下夜讀，真是其樂無窮。</p>
<p>可是，我們這種享受的權利很快地就消失了，我們開始沒有力量買新書看，望書興嘆，內心的苦澀和渴望，正和飢餓的人們希望飲食一樣。</p>
<p>於是，我們轉移了陣地，成爲舊書店攤的常客，這一來總算過了癮，這裏也不乏很多可觀的舊書，不但常常可以發現絕版了的雜誌，富有參考價值；而且正如津津君在本刊所寫的「一個奇蹟」一樣，往往有新版的雜誌可見，這時的滋味眞像發現翠玉之於璞石一樣呢！至於如果在無意中，偶而能够發現一部像浮生六記那樣的文學作品，祗好算是掏冷攤的意外收穫了。</p>
<p>事實上，出版界的不景氣，使書報雜誌不得不一再縮減篇幅，提高售價，讀者不勝負担，銷數自然淸淡，白紙印上黑字反不及原令紙張值錢，舊書最大的去路還不是論斤秤兩的回到造紙廠</p>
<p>因此，舊書店攤又不能不成爲我們唯一的去處。</p>
<p>我們的精神食糧已感不繼，我們已經成爲標準的文化難民！</p>
<h3>美國的養老問題</h3>
<p>— 毛毅</p>
<p>自從工業革命發生，資本主義的發達影響到家庭經濟和倫理觀念，於是產生了小家庭制度，隨之而來的也發生了如何供養和安排年老的一輩這問題。</p>
<p>美國是一個高度的資本主義的國家，它的養老問題更爲嚴重。在一八五〇年，六十五歲以上的老人僅佔美國人口的百分之三。而今天，他們的比例巳增加百分之七，人數達一千萬名。由於科學的進展和衛生的改良，老人的數額是會有增無減的。但是，人數雖然有增無減，在子孫輩的家小優度餘生的老人却有減無增</p>
<p>最大部份的美國老人，約有四百萬名，依賴某種形式的有組織的施捨維持生活。一小部份的老人享受到適當的私人方面的捕助金，民政處的退休津貼，或者退伍津貼。不過，大部份的老人還是以平均每月三十塊錢的州政府和聯邦政府的老年救濟金或保險金苟延餘喘。前者是一種苦惱的權宜之計，後者簡直是一種虐而謔的惡作劇。</p>
<p>衰年而不幸經濟拮据實在是可怕的。他們的最後的一綫希望是托庇於公立的或私立的「濟貧院」。而據各方面的報吿，這些大多數的美國老人終老的機關多半竟是狄更司筆下的窮街陋巷。而這些機關又是人滿爲患。那麽，那些運這種並不安樂的避難所都不得其門而入的老者遭遇又如何呢？一個大城市的市立濟貧院的首腦回答說：「他們孤零的死去。」</p>
<p>養老的軍要不下於育幼。年少的一輩雖是我們的新生代，但是，年長的一輩是我們的培植者。更何況我們每一個人都有年長的一天呢！</p>
<h3>清高</h3>
<p>— 翼君</p>
<p>甲：就要舉行學業考試了吧</p>
<p>乙：是的，本月十日開始，十一一日考完。</p>
<p>甲：學業完成了，可喜呀！</p>
<p>乙：哪里？「畢業即失業」，悲哀得很！</p>
<p>甲：老兄畢業以後的工作怎樣？</p>
<p>乙：正在各方進行，還沒有把握。</p>
<p>甲：大概什麼工作呢？</p>
<p>乙：我是學教育的，當然是在教育界服務。</p>
<p>甲：那好極了，教育工作是多淸高啊！</p>
<p>乙：但是那太淸苦了。</p>
<p>甲：淸苦是淸苦一點，但各種職業都不如你們教育界淸高。</p>
<p>乙：關於淸高不淸高，我倒有一點意見。</p>
<p>甲：願聞高見。</p>
<p>乙：我認爲，「職業」本身無所謂淸高不淸高，問題是從事職業的「人」怎樣？如果從事職業的「人」是淸高的，那便無論何種職業都是淸高的；如果從事職業的「人」不淸高，那便無論何種職業都是不淸高的。</p>
<p>甲：有道理。</p>
<p>乙：譬如，我們教育界，就有貪污，勒索，學店，強姦的事實，這能算淸高嗎？官塲中也有不少忠誠服務，廉潔自守之士，我在初中時的校長，做過一任縣長，家里反賣掉了幾畝地；家父做過多年的總務科長，卻是宦囊如洗，這也說做官不清高嗎？總而言之，淸高不淸高，在於「人品」怎樣，不在於「職業」是那一行。</p>
<p>甲：你的話很對，淸高不淸高在乎「人品」。可是「職業」本身的不淸高也是有的，例如賭窟，妓館，強盜等行業。</p>
<p>乙：但是，對於那些行業，我的答覆是，根本不承認其爲「職業」。那不過是社會所造成的「罪惡」罷了。</p>

<h3>President Chiang Concerned About the Participation of the Min and Youth Parties in the Government; Zhang Qun and Lei Zhen Arrive in Shanghai Successively for Negotiations</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Nanjing, 17th] President Chiang is concerned about the participation of the Min and Youth Parties in the government. At 5:00 PM on the 17th, he summoned Chen Bu Lei and Lei Zhen, expressing earnestly that the policy of cooperation among the three parties in the constitutional government will not be changed. He hopes to negotiate with the Min and Youth Parties to participate in the government before the issue of legislators is resolved. Lei Zhen will travel to Shanghai by train on the night of the 17th to assist Zhang Qun in negotiating with the two parties.</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Nanjing, 17th] According to a reporter's investigation, the Kuomintang is determined to make every effort to negotiate on the issue of the participation of the Min and Youth Parties in the government in order to facilitate its success. The Kuomintang believes that at this critical moment, it is hoped that the Min and Youth Parties will prioritize the interests of the country and not make the resolution of the issue of legislators a prerequisite for participating in the government. They hope that while trying to resolve the issue of legislators, they can participate in the government first. The positions of Minister of Agriculture and Forestry and Minister of Industry and Commerce, which will be held by the Youth Party, can be temporarily filled by suitable candidates before Zuo Shunsheng and Chen Qitian arrive in Nanjing to assume their duties, so that this part of the government affairs will not be suspended for a long time. The positions of Vice President of the Examination Yuan and Vice President of the Judicial Yuan, as well as members of the Examination Committee and Grand Justices, which are outside the Executive Yuan, are filled by the President, who recruits suitable candidates and submits them to the Control Yuan for approval. Their nature is different from the legislators who are selected through consultation, so they should not be confused with the issue of legislators. This opinion has been conveyed by the Kuomintang to the Min and Youth Parties, and it is hoped that the two parties will consider it in order to break the current deadlock.</p>
<p>[News from Our Newspaper] Zhang Qun and his wife arrived in Shanghai by special plane at 4:30 PM yesterday. Wu Guozhen, Wu Tiecheng, Zhang Jia'ao, Zhang Junmai, and others went to Longhua Airport to welcome them. At 7:00 PM, Zhang Jia'ao hosted a banquet for Zhang Qun at a restaurant in Hongqiao Township. Wu Tiecheng and Zhang Junmai were also present. Mayor Wu did not attend due to another appointment. It is understood that Zhang Qun's visit is entirely to resolve the deadlock over the number of legislators for the Min and Youth Parties. He must return to Nanjing within the next week to report on his mission. Zhang Qun exchanged preliminary views with Zhang Junmai yesterday and spoke with Zuo Shunsheng on the phone, arranging to make initial contact with the key figures of the Youth Party in Shanghai this morning.</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Nanjing, 17th] The selection of candidates for Vice President of the Judicial Yuan and Vice President of the Examination Yuan will involve recruiting figures from the Min and Youth Parties. Liu Zhe, Vice President of the Control Yuan, visited Xu Fulin of the Social Democratic Party on the morning of the 17th to discuss this matter. Xu stated that the party's Central Standing Committee did not discuss this matter last week. Xu will take the night train to Shanghai on the 18th to attend the party's Central Standing Committee meeting this week. The issue of the vice presidents may be brought up for discussion. When asked about the selection of Grand Justices, Xu stated that the Kuomintang has not yet discussed it with them. If there are consultations, the party will be able to consider it.</p>
<h3>Zeng Qi's Speech and Remarks</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Nanjing, 17th] Zeng Qi of the Youth Party issued a statement on the 17th, saying: "The Youth Party has decided to withdraw from the Executive Yuan because the issue of legislators has not been reasonably resolved. The party's propaganda department has already issued a statement to this effect, which is a natural and unavoidable move. This is because the number of legislators was agreed upon long ago, and after repeated consultations between the representatives of the two parties, it was reduced from 80 to 41, but there is still no prospect of its realization. The 30 names proposed for joint signature are also unattainable. How can a political party with 25 years of history attend meetings with only a handful of people? Since it cannot attend the Legislative Yuan, it is inconvenient to participate in the Executive Yuan, let alone issues such as the Examination Yuan and the Judicial Yuan. It is rumored that I will head one of the Yuan. The President has indeed directly and indirectly sought my consent in the past. Because the issue of legislators has not been resolved and my health has not recovered, I still ask the President to select other capable people. My thoughts can be seen in the following words: 'Constitutional government is completed, the original intention is achieved, I will roast taro in Hengshan to take care of my sick body, and fish in Yanlai to fulfill my long-cherished wishes.' I am now hearing that Zhang Qun is going to Shanghai to mediate, and the outcome is difficult to predict. I hope that all parties can understand our party's withdrawal from the government and not be too surprised. It should be known that in a constitutional country, there is also the matter of one party governing. If the Kuomintang feels that its past achievements are very satisfactory and can cope with the current crisis alone, then it can resolutely take full responsibility for it, and we will be happy to see it succeed and will only assist from the sidelines, and will never hinder it. However, one thing must be noted: there is only one party that can take over the cabinet, but there is no parliament that can be taken over by one party. This is related to the constitutional system and the focus of domestic and foreign observation, so it should still be considered."</p>
<h3>President Chiang Persuades Zhang Boling to Head the Examination Yuan; He May No Longer Decline</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Nanjing, 17th] The President intends to nominate Zhang Boling as the President of the Examination Yuan, which has been approved by the Kuomintang Central Standing Committee. However, Zhang has declined due to his age. However, the President places great trust in Zhang and will still persuade him to assume the position. According to general speculation here, Zhang may no longer insist on declining.</p>

<h3>Legislative Yuan's Finance and Banking Committee Discusses the Temporary Property Tax Bill; Discussion on the Tax Threshold and Valuation Method to Continue Tomorrow</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Nanjing, 17th] The Legislative Yuan's Finance and Banking Committee held a meeting on the afternoon of the 17th, convened by Committee Chairman Jian Guansan, to review the temporary property tax bill proposed by Liu Butong. The legislative principles were discussed first, and it was decided that: (1) the name would remain the original "Temporary Property Tax"; (2) the purpose of collecting this tax is, ideally, to equalize social wealth, and practically, to adapt to the needs of war and increase reasonable sources of revenue; (3) in addition to natural persons, all legal persons should, in principle, be subject to the tax, but methods of reduction, exemption, and preferential treatment should be determined according to their nature. After the Chairman raised this point, it sparked fierce debate. Some argued that legal persons should be treated the same as natural persons, being subject to the tax across the board, while others argued that legal persons should not be subject to the tax at all. The two sides argued for more than an hour before deciding on this principle. The committee is scheduled to meet again on the 19th to discuss issues such as the tax threshold and valuation method for the temporary property tax.</p>

<h3>Control Yuan Seriously Discusses the Supervisory Law; Right of Consent Listed in Separate Regulations; Plenary Review Session to Continue Today</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Nanjing, 17th] The fourth meeting of the Control Yuan was held at 9:25 AM on the 17th, with 128 members present, chaired by President Yu. After the Secretariat read the minutes of the third meeting, the agenda items were discussed. First, the draft Supervisory Law prepared by the drafting committee of the Supervisory Law was submitted for discussion. After Lu Chao reported on the review and passage by the drafting committee, speakers were very enthusiastic, all focusing on the opinions on the right of consent. Some believed that it should be listed in separate regulations and not included in the Supervisory Law; others believed that the four powers should be listed together and should be included in the Supervisory Law, with some textual revisions. After further discussion, it was decided to form a plenary review committee to conduct a repeat review and scheduled a meeting for 3:00 PM. Then, the regulations on the organization of the Inspection Committee's Executive Office were discussed. There were a total of two cases, the draft and the regulations of the former Control Yuan. In addition, there was a proposal by Zhao Guangchen, Hao Yulin, and 40 others, which was also related to the issue of the Executive Office: "Please establish the basic principles of the organization of the Executive Office of the Inspection Committee of this Yuan to maximize the effectiveness of the exercise of supervisory power." Zhao Guangchen explained the main points of the proposal, and due to time constraints, the meeting was adjourned. Another drafting committee was formed to merge the organizational laws of the various committees and the regulations on the organization of the Executive Office of the Inspection Committee and hand them over to the drafting committee for discussion.</p>
<p>At around 3:00 PM, the Control Yuan held a plenary committee review meeting, with 74 members present, chaired by Tian Jiongjin. No results were obtained today, and it was decided to continue the plenary review session on the morning of the 18th. At the beginning of the discussion on the 17th, the issue of whether to include the right of consent still sparked fierce debate. Ni Bi was the strongest advocate for inclusion. He believed that the right of consent is one of the powers in the Supervisory Law, so it must be included in the Supervisory Law. However, most people advocated drafting separate rules for its exercise, believing that the right of consent is not a supervisory power but a parliamentary power, and it is not a power of prior supervision. This is because this kind of right of consent only extends to a small portion of officials stipulated by the Constitution, and not to all officials. Since the right of consent does not belong to one of the supervisory powers, it should not be included. After a vote, the majority still agreed not to include it and to draft separate rules for its exercise. Then, the issue of dividing the Supervisory Law into chapters was discussed. The result was (1) General Provisions, (2) Correction, (3) Examinations, (4) Impeachment, (5) Investigation, (6) Supplementary Provisions. The word "power" was deleted from "power of correction". The discussion only reached the end of the second chapter today and the meeting was adjourned. The unfinished parts were handed over to the plenary review session on the 18th for discussion. At the same time, five committee members, Lin Shizeng, Gu Fengxiang, Huang Jue, Zhu Weiqi, and Tian Jiongjin, were appointed to organize the chapters and articles of each chapter and the first chapter of general provisions, and to draft the draft rules for the exercise of the right of consent.</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Criticism of Japan's [Five-Year Economic Recovery Plan]</h3>
<p>The U.S. government's request to Congress for an appropriation of $150 million to implement the Japan, Korea, and Ryukyu plan was rejected by the House of Representatives on the 3rd of this month. When this news reached Tokyo, officials felt unhappy, and the Japanese asked the Allied Headquarters: "Does this indicate a change in U.S. policy toward Japan?" Allied officials had to admit that without this appropriation, it would be tantamount to removing the foundation of Japan's "Five-Year Economic Recovery Plan." Although this decision by the U.S. House of Representatives is a major blow to Japan's economic recovery plan, it cannot completely dismantle Japan's entire recovery plan.</p>
<p>Japan's "Five-Year Economic Recovery Plan" was announced by the Economic Recovery Planning Council on May 17, one day earlier than the publication of the Clayton Report. After the announcement of Japan's recovery plan, American public opinion immediately supported it. Later, British Foreign Office official Taining inquired about the truth of American policy toward Japan, and American public opinion remained silent for some time to avoid being driven by the British Commonwealth countries. However, Under Secretary of the Army Clayton said on May 26, "Japan has begun its economic recovery, but the task is heavy and the road is long, and it cannot be achieved in one fell swoop... To ensure the success of this plan, Japan must tighten its belt even more than before, and American aid should not be rushed." The appropriation bill requested by the U.S. government from Congress was submitted by the Department of the Army. The $150 million was the initial appropriation, and the total figure was $675 million. According to the original plan, of the $150 million, $110 million would be provided to Japan to purchase raw materials, machinery, leather, coking coal, and other important commodities, all of which are necessary industrial raw materials for Japan's recovery plan. If Japan obtains this batch of raw materials, the foundation for the recovery plan will be laid, and the stagnant Japanese industry will immediately become active. The doubts felt by various countries in the Far East about the U.S. policy of supporting Japan can be attributed to this threat.</p>
<p>According to Japan's "Five-Year Economic Recovery Plan," it is a draft made by the Economic Security Headquarters. From the Katayama Cabinet to the Ashida Cabinet, it took nine months to study and draft this plan. As the "Asahi Shimbun" in Tokyo said on May 18, "Government officials and representatives of capitalists account for the overwhelming majority, scholars are just nominal, and there are only two representatives from labor unions." This clearly shows the interests represented by this plan. The content of this plan is divided into eight items: "Economic Recovery Goals," "Industry and Mining," "Food," "Trade," "Transportation," "Reconstruction," "Employment," and "National Income." The goal of economic recovery is to achieve the living standards of 1930-34 in 1952 and the level of Japanese industry that can maintain this living standard. According to this plan, in 1952, the Japanese population will increase by 25% compared with the pre-war period, reaching 82,932,000 people. Therefore, the industrial production required by the five-year plan must adapt to the living standards of 83 million people and ensure their stability and health. Therefore, the living standards and industrial levels planned to be completed in 1952 are as follows:</p>
<p>Morning Forest Fisheries Production</p>
<p>Living Standard</p>
<p>Personal consumption expenditure (per person per year) 116.0 yen</p>
<p>Food (per person per day) 2,211 calories</p>
<p>Clothing (per person per year) 7.4 pounds</p>
<p>Note: The amounts and amount indexes in this table are based on the average prices of 1930-34.</p>
<p>According to the above table, taking coal and copper ingots, the main sectors of heavy industry, as examples, the target for 1952 is 141% for both coal and steel ingots. The reason for this is that the Japanese population in 1952 will increase compared with the population in 1930-34; the increase in population naturally expands the living standards. Even if the estimated increase in population in 1952 in this plan is not exaggerated, in fact, compared with the average of 1930 (64,450,005 people) and 1935 (69,254,148 people), the increase of 6,852,076 people is only about 124%, not reaching the ratio of 141%. Taking the overall industrial and mining production target, as shown in the previous table, the percentage of 1930-34 is 130%, which also greatly exceeds the ratio required for the assumed population in 1952. This means that the industrial and mining industries, which once served as the material basis for Japanese aggression, have already exceeded the level of Japanese industrial and mining industries in 1930-34 in this plan. The development of high industrial levels is not limited to this. According to Shozo Mizutani, Minister of Commerce and Industry, "If the Clayton Plan is adopted, most of Japan's heavy industry and power equipment can be retained. Therefore, all production targets in the Japanese government's original five-year plan can be completed within four years. The Japanese government must thoroughly revise its original economic recovery plan and raise all production targets to a higher level."</p>
<p>Observing Japanese public opinion in the past week, if the U.S. Congress approves the loan to Japan, this "Five-Year Economic Recovery Plan" will not only be implemented smoothly, but may even be revised, and it will develop to a level without boundaries. Unexpectedly, the U.S. House of Representatives ruled against appropriating funds for Japan, which, in the eyes of the Japanese government, was like a bolt from the blue, blowing the Ashida Cabinet and the "Five-Year Economic Recovery Plan" from the sky to the ground. However, the plan that has fallen can still stand up and rise again. As Clayton said, the implementation of Japan's recovery plan is "a heavy task and a long road," and it is necessary to "tighten its belt even more than before" to ensure the success of the plan. Clayton's care for Japan can be described as meticulous, which is indeed completely in line with the situation of the Japanese people's arduous struggle. In short, today's Japan is learning the spirit of King Goujian of Yue, "Do not eat what one has not planted, do not wear what one's wife has not woven, do not collect from the country for ten years, and the people have three years of food." (Guoyu Yueyu Shang) The implementation of the recovery plan has begun. The "U.S. aid" is only a temporary setback, and does not completely dismantle its existence. Its existence and development still pose a great threat to various countries in the Far East. To eliminate this threat, the Far Eastern Commission must take effective steps to cancel Japan's "Five-Year Economic Recovery Plan"!</p>

<h3>Xia Weishang, President of the Jiangsu Provincial Special Criminal Court, Resigns and is Approved</h3>
<p>Jiang Congzu is Appointed to Succeed Him</p>
<p>[This newspaper's Suzhou dispatch, 17th] Xia Weishang, president of the Jiangsu Provincial Special Criminal Court, requested to resign due to the difficulties in the preparatory work. His resignation has been approved. The successor has also been selected by the ministry, and the famous lawyer Jiang Congzu has been appointed to succeed him. However, Jiang believes that the establishment of the court is fraught with difficulties, and it is difficult to find a site. According to statistics, there are currently no less than 3,000 bandits in various counties of Jiangsu who have been arrested and are awaiting trial. Once the court is established, they will all be transferred for trial. Moreover, cases of banditry and disruption of finance also fall within the scope of special criminal cases, and the construction of the detention center is difficult to realize due to the limited funds. Therefore, Jiang has decided to wait until he reports to Minister Xie for instructions before making a decision.</p>

<h3>Qingdao's Frenzied Conscription: Citizens Become Birds of Fright, Three Offenders Executed on the Spot, Lungs Spilling Out</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Qingdao Fourteenth Dispatch] For a municipality directly under the central government like Qingdao, armed conscription has occurred consecutively within ten days, which is truly appalling! On the evenings of the third and fourth, many merchants and coolies were arrested in the Dongzhen area. The number of people was counted by trucks, loaded onto China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Haiyou and Haigui ships, and sailed away one after another, destination unknown. Those who attempted to escape were beaten to death in the sea. This was the initial news the reporter received. At that time, there was a scene of families collectively wailing at the docks. Subsequently, various lawless soldiers continued to arrest people, claiming to be capturing deserters. "The atmosphere in the city is filled with fear, with everyone on edge. Few people are seen in remote alleys at night, and even during the day, people are wary of armed soldiers." On the evening of the ninth, a woman was beaten to death for trying to rescue her arrested husband. On the evening of the eleventh, people were also arrested in the downtown area near the Huale Theater, and it was rumored that more people were beaten to death.</p>
<p>From 11:00 AM on the twelfth, "the sound of conscription spread throughout the city." Qingdao citizens were like hearing the sound of air raid sirens. "Shops closed, vendors packed up, and the order around the Sanlu Market, Jinan Road, Beiping Road, and Licun Road areas was extremely chaotic. People fled in all directions as if facing a formidable enemy." Afterwards, officials claimed it was a misunderstanding. The reporter witnessed the chaotic situation at that time, filled with an atmosphere of fear and violence. The good words of discipline and order, which people had always been accustomed to hearing, were completely bankrupt. The wife of a Mr. So-and-so, a telegraph operator from an official news agency, was holding her baby and riding in a rickshaw passing through the intersection of Market Road when the rickshaw puller, upon hearing the news, hurriedly abandoned the rickshaw and fled, causing the rickshaw to overturn and the baby to cry out and die. A local newspaper said that this "seemed to be a state of anarchy." A newspaper headline read: "The authorities cannot shirk their supervisory responsibility; the Shandong compatriots are too honest." This is indeed the truth. Furthermore, it plainly stated that the conscription incidents "started last winter and have not stopped to this day."</p>
<p>The authorities are simply thinking about the government's prestige and reputation, emphasizing it repeatedly. One explanation is that they had not received reports, and another is that wicked people were spreading rumors. However, the uproar is undoubtedly a blatant fact. The Pacification Zone Headquarters, on the one hand, ordered the police and detectives to strictly prohibit and investigate, and on the other hand, dispatched cadres to supervise and lead inspectors to secretly arrest people everywhere. On the morning of the thirteenth, only three minor conscription offenders, Cao Yungui, Fei Yuanze, and Wang Zengfu, were found at the Xiaogang Trading Market and the Dongzhen Assembly Factory. They were all soldiers from the Seventh Brigade of the Fifty-fourth Division and were executed on the spot. One bullet entered from the back, immediately causing the chest to explode open and the lungs to spill out.</p>
<p>The Pacification Zone said that the division commander and brigade commander would also be severely punished. It is believed that this statement can "serve as a warning to others."</p>
<p>Many places in Qingdao are unique. Just speaking of prices, apart from the special zone, it is the highest in the country. The people were already gasping for breath under high pressure, and their hearts were restless. The sound of gunfire in the city is a common occurrence. If there are exercises, the sound of cannons will be heard, rumbling incessantly, which is not surprising. But this kind of turmoil in an "anarchic state" is truly unbearable.</p>
<p>The reasons for conscription: Some say that it is because the source of soldiers is insufficient, and the troops cannot rely entirely on recruitment to replenish their numbers, so the conscription is justified. Some say that it is because they have to deal with inspections, so they have to take emergency measures to make up for the vacancies that have always been embezzled, and they have their difficulties. Some say that this is a way for individual unscrupulous soldiers to make money, and it is vividly rumored that the market price for releasing one conscript is 10 million legal tender, and for ten conscripts, it is a small silver ingot.</p>
<p>By the thirteenth, the City Council also had two solutions: (1) Request the authorities to release the conscripted men and demand guarantees in the future. (2) The families of the conscripted men should register quickly so that people can be claimed according to the list. From today onwards, the city is obviously much more stable. The impression of the large-scale conscription incident last winter is still very deep in the minds of the citizens. After several twists and turns, the arrested people were gradually released from Yantai and returned. Li Mi, the commander of the Eighth Army, issued a notice stating "Those who disturb the people will be killed," and the "conscription offenders" (this is a new term) were also punished. But now they are still arresting people back and forth, and the citizens have become birds of fright. "The Shandong compatriots are too honest," where is the guarantee?

<h3>French Parliament Approves Six-Nation West Germany Agreement by a Margin of Fourteen Votes, Tasking the Government to Ensure France Obtains Security Guarantees</h3>
<p>[Reuters Paris Seventeenth Dispatch] The French National Assembly this morning passed a resolution approving the recommendations of the London Six-Nation Conference, establishing a West German Constituent Assembly, and regulating the distribution of industrial products in the Ruhr, with 300 votes in favor and 286 against. In addition to authorizing the government to participate in the implementation of the London Conference recommendations, the resolution put forward by the majority party also asks the government to do its best to negotiate with the Western Allies so that some points in France's original proposal that were not adopted by the London Conference can be recognized by the Western Allies. The resolution recognizes that the recommendations of the London Conference show that the position repeatedly stated by Britain and the United States to France has been affirmed and approached, but some important points in the French proposal have not yet been adopted. The resolution also recognizes that if France refuses the resolutions of the London Conference, it will cause regrettable slack in the cooperation between friendly countries, and this continuous cooperation is the most reliable guarantee for peace today. The second part of the resolution tasks the government to report to Parliament immediately if it discovers any decisions that violate the following principles: (1) The internationalization of the Ruhr mines and basic industries. (2) Compensation obtained from Germany, and the methods should pay special attention to the extension of the period of military occupation of Germany, and the clear stipulation in the contract of the conditions for the withdrawal of Allied forces from Germany. (4) Eliminating the danger of the revival of any totalitarian Germany. (5) Continuing to explore the possibility of reaching an agreement on the German issue among the four powers. (6) Intensifying efforts to promote the economic and political recovery of Europe.</p>
<p>Before the vote, Prime Minister Schuman addressed the Foreign Minister Bidault, pointing out that German bandits cannot become a force for the rejuvenation of Europe, and are an economic burden on the Allied countries. France deeply understands this difficulty of the Allied countries, and the Germans themselves are deeply disturbed, so the delay in the solution will not help. The German people, who have lost their initiative and responsibility, must be reorganized. The National Assembly's approval of the London Conference resolution does not mean that the government's foreign policy, including close participation in the Western Union and the Marshall Plan, has been agreed to by the National Assembly. However, the extremely close number of votes between those who opposed and those who supported it shows that most French people are still afraid that before the Western European alliance can fully exert its effectiveness and France's defense strength can be newly established, Germany will be able to fully restore its vitality.</p>
<p>[Reuters Paris Sixteenth Dispatch] Foreign Minister Bidault today defended the Six-Nation proposal on Germany again in the National Assembly debate. He said, "In history, I don't know of a more effective control than the recommendations of the London Conference." He also announced that France has already decided to agree to the German currency reform, because without it, the French-occupied area of Germany will inevitably be suffocated. He emphasized that if France only refuses the recommendations of the London Conference without proposing other solutions, its seriousness cannot be ignored. He is convinced that France has no other way to go except to accept the recommendation.</p>
<h3>Soviet and Western Allied Officials Discuss German Currency Reform Issues, Soviet Union Issues Order to Strengthen Border Control</h3>
<p>[Reuters Berlin Sixteenth Dispatch] German officials in close contact with the Soviet military government confirmed that Soviet officials had met with Western Allied officials to discuss the Soviet Union's participation in the entire German currency reform issue. This discussion was purely exploratory, so no important officials from the four powers participated. These negotiations have been going on in Berlin for two days. Although they are called Allied negotiations, an official from the Berlin Municipal Government said that this is a negotiation between Soviet and American officials. If the discussions make progress, the Berlin Allied Control Council is expected to resume its meeting on June 20 to discuss national currency reform. The German side also said that the Soviet side has expressed its willingness to make some concessions if appropriate guarantees can be made. If the current chairman of the Allied Control Council, French Commander-in-Chief Koenig, prepares to convene a meeting of the Allied Control Council next Monday, the Soviet Union is also willing to attend the meeting. Otherwise, the Soviet Union will not object to convening a meeting of the Financial Committee under the Allied Control Council to discuss the issue of currency reform.</p>
<p>[Reuters London Seventeenth Dispatch] It is reported that the implementation of the West German currency reform is imminent. Berlin is not within the scope of implementation. At the same time, the Soviet occupying authorities also issued an order today announcing that Germans holding permits issued by the Western Allied authorities are prohibited from entering the Soviet occupation zone to prevent the use of inter-zone permits for illegal activities.</p>
<h3>Bevin Explains the Ruhr Issue</h3>
<p>[Reuters London Sixteenth Dispatch] Foreign Minister Bevin stated in the Lower House on the sixteenth in response to inquiries from parliamentarians that the British government's policy is to never allow the Ruhr area's coal mines to be owned by their original owners. The resolution of the four powers is that the Ruhr coal mine issue must be handled by the German people. Based on past experience, it is difficult to expect the best results if foreigners operate coal mines. In response to another member's question about what attitude German political parties take towards the issue of state-owned West German enterprises, Bevin replied that there are those who oppose and those who support it among German political parties. The Social Democrats and Communists expressed their support, while the Free Democrats and the German Party both expressed their opposition. The Christian Democrats support changing major industries to public-private ownership. The British government hopes that German political parties will announce their opinions to the German people when the issue is decided.</p>
<h3>US House and Senate Hold Joint Meeting to Adjust Differences in Foreign Aid Bill</h3>

<h3>International Control of Atomic Energy Program, Soviet Union Opposes US Proposal, Will Use Veto in Security Council</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency Lake Success Sixteenth United Press Dispatch] The Soviet Union has made it clear in the Security Council that it will veto the international control program for atomic energy proposed by the United States and supported by the majority. Soviet representative Gromyko spoke for an hour, attacking the US program as a tool of "war-mongering" conspiracies. Representatives from China, France, and Belgium supported the US proposal and responded to Gromyko's criticism. The final vote must be postponed until the seventeenth.</p>
<h3>Berlin Four-Power Joint Command Meeting, Soviet Representative Abruptly Leaves, Tantamount to Announcing the End of Berlin Joint Control</h3>
<p>[Reuters Berlin Seventeenth Dispatch] The Soviet representative abruptly left the meeting of the Berlin Four-Power Joint Command yesterday, ending the only remaining joint cooperation mechanism of the four powers in Germany. British and American headquarters frankly admitted that the joint control of Berlin and Germany by the four powers has been declared dead and may not be revived again. While admitting the extreme seriousness of the situation, a British spokesperson said that it is currently too early to speculate whether the Soviet Union's actions will be the final breakdown of the four-power joint control.</p>
<p>After the Joint Command meeting lasted for thirteen hours yesterday, US representative Howley asked the chairman, the French representative, for permission to leave first due to excessive fatigue. Unexpectedly, the entire Soviet delegation left at this time without explaining the reason or apologizing to the chairman. The chairman had no choice but to adjourn the meeting without setting a date for the next meeting. The chairman also stated that his adjournment was due to the entire Soviet delegation leaving, not Howley's departure first. Howley later stated that he believed this was the end of the Berlin Four-Power Joint Command. However, he also stated that if one thinks that Britain, the United States, and France will be expelled from Berlin, then Britain, the United States, and France do not think so. Howley pointed out that considerable progress had already been made at yesterday's meeting, and he thought that the Soviet side must have deliberately created a serious situation to do this. The cooperation of the four powers has apparently been terminated in a very Russian way. Howley then solemnly stated that, from the perspective of the Western Allies, the Berlin Allied government has not ended due to the Soviet Union's actions. The joint management of the four powers may not be able to continue to be implemented, but the United States military government will continue to perform its obligations, especially the task of supplying food to the American military district.</p>
<h3>Poland Demands a Meeting of the Four-Power Allied Control Council</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse Warsaw Sixteenth Dispatch] The Polish government believes that it is currently necessary to immediately convene a meeting of the Berlin Four-Power Allied Control Council to discuss the London Six-Nation Agreement. In a note to the Allied Control Council, the head of its military delegation in Germany stated that if the Allied Control Council agrees, Poland is willing to express its opinions at the meeting.</p>
<p>[United Press Berlin Seventeenth Dispatch] Observers here say that Poland's request for France to convene the Allied Control Council is because the Soviet Union hopes that the council can play its role again. The council has been adjourned since March 20 of this year when the Soviet commander announced his withdrawal.</p>
<h3>French Labor Unrest Spreads, 250,000 Workers Strike in Belgium</h3>
<p>[United Press Paris Seventeenth Dispatch] Labor unrest has struck more than 25 cities, and as of tonight, the number of strikers has reached 100,000. Four thousand railway workers in Villeneuve, only ten miles from Paris, launched a thirty-minute strike last night to express their sympathy for the rubber workers.</p>
<p>[United Press Clermont-Ferrand, France Seventeenth Dispatch] The local police station and the strikers reached a truce agreement on the seventeenth, ending the bloody battle.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse Paris Sixteenth Dispatch] Communist members of parliament have submitted a motion in parliament requesting that the forced plan against strikers be stopped. The left-wing French Labor Confederation has also announced its full support for the strikers in Clermont-Ferrand. The dissenting union stated that it did not preside over the strike because it opposed increasing wages and advocated reducing prices. [United Press Brussels Sixteenth Dispatch] Approximately 250,000 steel and metal workers in Belgium went on strike today, demanding a 5% increase in wages. Employers rejected this request, but negotiations are still ongoing.</p>
<h3>Eight Countries, Including the UK and France, in the Far Eastern Commission Agree on Japan's Industrial Level, the US Strenuously Opposes and Still Advocates Raising It</h3>
<p>[United Press Washington Sixteenth Dispatch] The United Kingdom, France, the Philippines, India, Australia, the Netherlands, New Zealand, and Canada, eight countries of the Far Eastern Commission, agreed on Japan's industrial level today, but the United States still strenuously opposed it, and China and the Soviet Union also disagreed. As of now, the situation is very deadlocked, and it may be difficult to reach a final agreement. According to the intentions of the eight countries, Japan's industrial level should be lower than that stipulated in the Strike Report, while the United States advocates raising it to help Japan accelerate its recovery. Some committee members believe that this is the most important issue currently facing the committee. Another issue is the return of Japanese military looted materials found within Japan to their owners, which China is most concerned about. It is heard that China and the United States are conducting direct negotiations.</p>
<h3>Soviet and Australian Officials Comment on the US Supporting Japan</h3>
<p>[United Press Washington Sixteenth Dispatch] A Soviet official involved in Far Eastern affairs claimed on the sixteenth that the United States is deliberately delaying the peace treaty with Japan in order to buy time and build a high-level Japanese industry. Although Soviet representatives have not formally made this statement in the Far Eastern Commission, they often reveal this sentiment in informal conversations with some members of the Far Eastern Commission. Soviet officials told United Press that, according to their observations, the US attitude toward Japan is almost like the attitude of the United Kingdom toward Germany before the last world war. They said: The United Kingdom at that time willingly tolerated Germany's rearmament plan because it believed that Germany would never attack Western countries, but would use it to attack the Soviet Union to the east. Now the United States also seems to believe deeply that the revived Japan will never be enough to threaten the United States' position in the Pacific, but will be a threat to the Soviet Union's Far East.</p>
<p>[United Press Canberra Sixteenth Dispatch] Australian Foreign Minister Evatt said in the Lower House today in response to criticism of his foreign policy from opposition members that the United States' restoration of Japan is largely a side effect of the tension in US-Soviet relations. The United States agreed two years ago that Japan should not have wartime industries, but this policy has now changed. Japan may be an important factor in a future US-Soviet conflict, but the new US policy may pose a threat to countries in the Pacific such as Australia, just like the policy after World War I, which posed a threat to democracy in Germany. The countries not listed in the Far Eastern Commission also share the same view.</p>
<h3>Hong Kong Chinese Merchants to Hold Meeting Tomorrow to Boycott Dumping of Japanese Goods</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse Hong Kong Seventeenth Dispatch] The sales of Japanese goods in Hong Kong have a rather bleak future if Hong Kong Chinese merchants unanimously boycott them. The Chinese Manufacturers' Association requested the authorities several weeks ago to convene a general meeting of all sectors to establish a Southeast Asian boycott Japanese goods group. The Hong Kong government, deeply afraid that this movement would develop into an anti-American movement, stated that this meeting could only be allowed to be convened on the condition that anti-American words were not used, and political speeches were not allowed to be delivered. The Chinese Manufacturers' Association accepted these conditions and decided to hold the first organized protest meeting in Hong Kong against the dumping of Japanese goods in Southeast Asia on the nineteenth. The threat of Japanese goods competition has already affected the Hong Kong textile industry. So far, Shanghai funds flowing into Hong Kong that were prepared to be invested in industry have stopped. Chinese textile manufacturers who moved here from Shanghai have already put their factory opening plans on hold and are engaged in commercial activities until the threat of Japanese goods competition is reduced before making plans.</p>

<p>[Our Own Correspondent] The "Ji Guang" vessel, carrying the first shipment of American aid rice, arrived in Shanghai from Bangkok at 2:00 PM yesterday and is currently docked at China Merchants Bureau's Pier No. 1. This morning at 10:00 AM, representatives from all sectors of Shanghai will hold a reception ceremony. Mayor Wu, Mr. Ren, and Mr. Shifu will all participate. The American side will be represented by the Acting Consul General. The "Ji Guang" brought a total of 1,460 tons of rice. According to the contract signed on the 30th of last month, our country will receive 145,000 tons of American aid rice within the three months of June, July, and August of this year. The most pressing issue to be resolved is transportation. The China Merchants Bureau has designated seven or eight ships specifically for transporting the rice. In the future, one rice ship is expected to arrive every four to five days.</p>
<p>Additionally, the American vessel "Donald McKay," carrying 6,364 tons of American aid flour, is scheduled to arrive in Shanghai today.</p>
<p>[Our Own Correspondent, Nanjing, 17th] After the first shipment of American aid flour, totaling 6,364 tons, arrives, it will first be received by the Executive Yuan's Committee on the Use of American Aid. Then, the Ministry of Food, in consultation with the committee, will allocate it as grain for the second phase of urban rationing. Whether grain rationing in various North China ports can uniformly switch to flour is currently undecided. However, the grain rationed in Tianjin and Beijing is already entirely flour.</p>

<h3>Unemployed Workers from Lun Chang Factory Petition the Bureau of Social Affairs for Reinstatement</h3>
<p>[Our Own Correspondent] Representatives of over 30 unemployed workers from the Lun Chang Dyeing and Weaving Factory, known for its dyed Lun Chang floral fabrics, petitioned the Bureau of Social Affairs yesterday. The British-owned Lun Chang Dyeing and Weaving Factory in Pudong suffered extensive damage to its machinery after the outbreak of the Pacific War. The Japanese then moved workers and machinery from the Gongda No. 2 Dyeing and Weaving Factory into the Lun Chang Factory to resume production. After the victory, the British company took over Lun Chang and laid off all the workers from the former Gongda factory, numbering over 400. The General Labor Union conducted two investigations, and the factory agreed to prioritize the reinstatement of unemployed workers when the need for more workers arose. The factory resumed production last November and hired new workers, but did not reinstate any of the former workers. Several days ago, over 400 unemployed workers surrounded the Lun Chang Factory, but were dispersed by the police. Yesterday, 30 representatives petitioned the Bureau of Social Affairs, requesting reinstatement. The Bureau has scheduled a mediation session between labor and management today.</p>

<h3>Mayor Wu's Remarks on the Jiao Tong University Incident; Hopes Non-Professional Students Will Quickly Clarify Their Intentions; If They Continue to Delay, Public Interrogation Will Be Conducted</h3>
<p>[Our Own Correspondent] Mayor Wu met with reporters in the Municipal Government conference room at 5:00 PM yesterday, and made some remarks regarding the different positions of the Municipal Government and the university regarding the handling of the student anti-Japan demonstration, as stated by President Cheng of Jiao Tong University. He acknowledged that the positions of the Municipal Government and the university were indeed different. The university adopted an attitude of "leading with virtue, regulating with propriety," while the Municipal Government adopted "leading with governance, regulating with punishment." Although the policies are different, the goal is the same. The former is applied to the majority of good students and is for "pacifying the good," while the latter is aimed at a small number of professional students and is for "eliminating violence." Therefore, they are actually achieving the same goal through different routes and should complement each other.</p>
<p>Regarding the second letter that the Jiao Tong University Student Union sent to the Mayor yesterday, Mr. Wu said after reading it yesterday, "It's really fun." The questions raised repeatedly in the letter can be summarized as: "The student anti-Japan demonstration is a patriotic movement, why as the Mayor do you not cherish it but instead suppress it?" Mayor Wu has repeatedly clarified that the demonstration was not purely a patriotic movement, but in fact a conspiracy, so it must be thoroughly investigated.</p>
<p>As for the Student Union's request in the letter that students be allowed to observe the interrogation (original text: "You do not allow students to testify, are you afraid that they will speak their minds on the spot and expose your lies?"), it is considered pure nonsense. The Municipal Government does not allow students to observe the interrogation because it is afraid that the students will sing and disrupt the order of the meeting. As for the public procedures for the interrogation in the future, the Municipal Government has already planned it properly. If Jiao Tong University still does not respond within this week, then next week, the Municipal Council, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, the General Labor Union, the Education Association, the District Court Prosecutor's Office, the Police Bureau, the Garrison Headquarters, and the presidents of all vocational colleges and above will be invited to hold a meeting to publicly discuss the procedures for interrogating and calling witnesses, and implement it after reaching a consensus.</p>
<p>Mayor Wu gave a final warning to the Jiao Tong University Student Union yesterday. He said: If you are not professional students, but purely patriotic youths, then you should quickly clarify your intentions to the 5 million citizens of the city and all the students of the school, and quickly answer the questions raised by the Municipal Government. He guarantees that it will be made public to society. Mayor Wu finally said: I would like to borrow a common phrase used by the Communist Party—"The eyes of the people are discerning." Let the citizens of the city judge the right and wrong of the student anti-Japan demonstration.</p>

<p>[Our Own Correspondent] On the 16th, the Municipal Council received a telegram from the Ministry of National Defense stating that, due to the fact that the establishment of the military service system and the implementation of military service laws have not been as ideal as hoped, in order to gather ideas and improve the situation, the following eleven issues are raised: (1) Are there any aspects of the current military service system that need to be improved, and how should they be improved? (2) How can we ensure that people, especially the wealthy and powerful, cannot evade military service obligations? (3) How can we ensure that county, township, town, and baojia people take their responsibilities for military service seriously and without corruption? (4) How should military service be handled in areas plagued by bandits? (5) How can new recruits be made more suitable for use after being assigned to the military units, and how can desertion be reduced? (6) How can the connection between new recruits and their families be maintained after they arrive at the military units, in order to alleviate the suffering of "their birth and death are unknown to their families"? (7) Under the current circumstances, is it possible to arrange for discharge, and how should discharge be handled? (8) How can the party, government, military, and people coordinate and cooperate to promote military service? (9) How should the allocation of land to soldiers (new recruits) be implemented in a practical and convenient manner? (10) How should preferential treatment payments and settlement allowances for conscripted families be distributed in a practical and convenient manner? (11) If the conscription process is changed to a system of gradual supplementation, with recruits moving up from the county self-defense forces to the security forces and then to the national army units, how can this be done effectively? The case has been distributed to various provincial and municipal governments, party headquarters, councils, headquarters of the pacification commissioners, general headquarters for the suppression of bandits, headquarters of the pacification zones, Zhengzhou and Hankou command posts, army headquarters, and Xuzhou command posts, requesting that they provide opinions based on current facts, gathering public opinion, and using an objective and candid attitude, and requesting a reply within two weeks of receiving the document.

The mayor should give priority to assigning the laid-off employees to emerging businesses or other business institutions. (2) Street names should not be changed lightly.

<h3>Shanghai Rumor of a "Yang Sister" Unproven to Abstain from Food; Mysterious and Unclear Background to Undergo Physiological Examination</h3>
<p>[Report from this Newspaper] Recently, a rumor has spread in this city that a "Shanghai Yang Sister," Zhang Dailin, comparable to the Chongqing Yang Sister who has abstained from food for nine years, has appeared. It is said that she has also abstained from food for five years. However, after inquiries from various sources by reporters, as of now, no one has been able to confirm this. Although she and the Chongqing Yang Sister have similarities in life and personality, there are also significant differences. The "Shanghai Yang Sister" has high breasts and a sunken abdomen, likes modern fashion, and loves cosmetics such as lipstick, rouge, eye shadow, and nail polish. She has long hair, but it is black in the front and red in the back, which is quite special. Her eyes are bright and sparkling. She graduated from the junior high school of Qingxin Middle School in Tianjin, can write beautiful penmanship, and loves music and trees. Her tone of voice is very low, which is similar to the Chongqing Yang Sister.</p>
<p>Contradictory Words</p>
<p>The reason why Zhang's abstention from food was discovered is that her husband, Zhang Pengfei, who has been married to her for three years and is currently a supervisor in the Jianghai area, revealed it to a friend who is a journalist during a conversation not long ago. Subsequently, the journalist introduced this "Shanghai Yang Sister" to her father, Huang Linshu (currently working as a specialist in the Social Affairs Bureau). According to Huang, he has known the "Shanghai Yang Sister" for a very short time. However, when they first met, Zhang called Huang her adopted father. After several days of contact, Huang expressed doubts about whether Zhang had any neurological abnormalities. Huang had inquired from Zhang how many years she had been in Shanghai, and she replied about ten years. When asked when she started abstaining from food, she replied that it was at the age of sixteen, when she was in Tianjin. However, Zhang is currently twenty-one years old, so her answers are contradictory.</p>
<p>Unsettled Residence</p>
<p>Another mysterious aspect of Zhang is that after marrying Zhang Pengfei, the two have never had a fixed residence. The night before last, Zhang was still staying at the Sanming Hotel near the Great World. As for her past background, it is also an incomprehensible mystery. Huang is now planning to have Zhang stay at his home starting today so that he can supervise her. Currently, both Huang and Zhang's couple are willing to hire a doctor to conduct a detailed physiological examination of Zhang.</p>
<p>Irritation When Seeing Food</p>

<h3>Two Fires; Gasoline Explosion Injures Workers; Six Houses Destroyed on Shanyin Road</h3>
<p>[Report from this Newspaper] Six wooden houses near the intersection of Zhongzheng East Road and Sichuan Road, north of the Mobil Gas Station, which were engaged in repairing cars, patching tires, and electrical work, unexpectedly caught fire at around 8:55 a.m. yesterday due to a worker's carelessness. The fire spread to the stored gasoline barrels. In an instant, the gasoline caught fire, the iron barrels exploded, and sparks flew everywhere. Fortunately, the employees in the adjacent Longmao Warehouse used the three water hoses they had prepared to inject water from the upstairs windows, controlling the fire. The warehouse was spared. Subsequently, the Central Fire Department, upon hearing the news, dispatched several pump trucks to the scene for rescue, and the fire was extinguished in about an hour. A tire-patching worker, Chen Bingzhang, was burned on the spot and was taken to Renji Hospital for treatment by ambulance. The police station in charge is sending officers to investigate the cause of the fire.</p>

After the incident, the cause of the fire was investigated by the police from the North Sichuan Road Police Station, who arrested and questioned the person responsible for the fire.</p>
<h3>Weng Zhong are Ornaments for Tomb Passages; Should Not Be Confused with Buddhism</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Buddhist Youth Association submitted a statement to Mayor Wu yesterday, stating: "According to reports, the police bureau plans to demolish the stone Weng Zhong on the side of the racecourse in this city because ignorant citizens gather there every day to burn incense and worship, obstructing traffic. Some who do not understand Buddhist doctrines even claim to be followers of Buddhism and use the excuse of religious freedom to advocate for the preservation or construction of temples, etc. Recently, a citizen named Zhu Shanmin and others filed a complaint with the court, and their words even included the phrase 'What crime has my Buddha committed to deserve this destruction?' (as reported in the newspaper on the 11th of this month), which is even more absurd. Our association, as a Buddhist youth group, is responsible for promoting Buddhist teachings. The Weng Zhong have originally been ornaments for tomb passages since the Han Dynasty and have absolutely no relationship with Buddhism. Now, ignorant people are confusing the Weng Zhong with Buddhism, which is inevitably misleading and insulting to Buddhism. The members of our association cannot remain silent and have made this statement to clarify the matter and call on society to correct its understanding."</p>

Soon after, someone grabbed a low stool from a shoe-shining stall and struck Zhang in the back of the head, and several people punched him in the back. Before long, they scattered to the east. At that time, although Zhang was injured, he still chased after them.

<h3>Public Sentiment Turns Weary, Sellers Consider Offloading; Rice Prices Show Slight Decline; Flour Initially Weak, Then Firm, Oil Market Rises Sharply</h3>
<p>The rice market declined because the tin market fell the previous day, so public sentiment has turned weary. In addition, with other commodity prices falling on the previous day, the rice market also felt that it was difficult to stand its ground. Therefore, at the opening of the morning market, sellers were very eager to sell. Medium and lower grades of japonica and indica rice were widely available on the market, but high-grade white japonica and thin paddy rice were not yet seen.

<p>New Medicine and New Drugs</p>
<h3>Regarding the Side Effects of Ebesal and its Usage</h3>
<p>— Liang Junqing</p>
<p>Since Dr. Xu Jing published an article in this newspaper introducing the new treatment for tuberculosis, Ebesal, it immediately caught the attention of general tuberculosis patients, who sent letters to inquire in droves, almost overwhelming Dr. Xu. Although Dr. Xu has successively published two replies, the number of people inquiring has continued unabated. This shows how many people in our country suffer from tuberculosis and that its "absolute" treatment is unfortunately still being sought. Because I dragged a tail in Dr. Xu's article, saying that it has side effects and must be used by experts to avoid mistakes, the readers also focused their letters on inquiring about this. Therefore, I have no choice but to jump out and join in the fun, publishing this article, which I think will contribute to some extent to readers suffering from tuberculosis.</p>
<p>Indeed, Ebesal is very effective for tuberculosis, but it also has its side effects. As long as it is used correctly, it is very effective. If it is used incorrectly, then it is harmful. Therefore, I request that doctors who use it must thoroughly understand its nature before using it, otherwise it is better not to use it. In order to make readers understand the nature of Ebesal, I have to go around in a big circle and roughly describe all the methods of treating tuberculosis.</p>
<p>Since the German Koch discovered the tuberculosis bacillus, medical experts all over the world have been searching for its cure. At first, Koch advocated the use of tuberculin, believing that it could be 100% effective and cure diseases like smallpox vaccination or diphtheria serum. However, after clinical trials, the results were very disappointing. Not only was it ineffective, but it also caused many tuberculosis patients to worsen and die rapidly. Everyone became suspicious and fearful of tuberculin, warning each other not to try it. Therefore, they shifted their direction and sought other conceivable methods. For example, physical therapy such as bed rest, high mountain convalescence, sun lamp irradiation, climate change therapy; chemical therapy such as calcium therapy, arsenic therapy, iron therapy, silicon therapy, and iodine therapy; nutritional therapy such as vitamin therapy, improved nutrition therapy, reduced salt therapy; surgical therapy such as artificial pneumothorax therapy, rib resection therapy, phrenic nerve resection therapy; and bacteriological therapy such as tuberculin. B.C.G. streptomycin therapy, and so on. It encompasses everything and cannot be described in detail at one time. Although there are many good medicines among them, the shortcomings are also very many, and ultimately it cannot be regarded as a specific medicine for treating tuberculosis. Therefore, everyone gradually improved their treatment methods, dividing tuberculosis patients into two types, one acute and the other chronic. In the acute stage, it can be said that there were no other good methods except for bed rest and improved nutrition. Since the invention of streptomycin, everyone thought it was a specific medicine for tuberculosis, but it is effective in certain conditions, while in most cases it is still useless. Therefore, up to now, in acute tuberculosis, I still do not have an absolutely effective specific medicine for tuberculosis.</p>
<p>As for chronic tuberculosis, there is much room for discussion. Because its disease is chronic and the time can be prolonged, many medicines can cure it, and even without any medicine, as long as you rest quietly, you can cure it. However, which method should be used to treat it in order to be more confident? That requires our careful selection.</p>
<p>Originally, the treatment of chronic tuberculosis is not only a headache for our doctors, but also for the general patients who feel at a loss and do not know what to do. Why? Let me tell you.</p>
<p>I have already said in the previous article that after tuberculosis becomes chronic, the time can be prolonged, and any method can cure it, or even heal itself without medicine. But conversely, it can also be said that any method is ineffective. For example! At present, artificial pneumothorax is still considered a more reliable method for treating tuberculosis. However, its scope of application is not very large, and it can only be used in patients with early or subacute tuberculosis. In chronic tuberculosis, there is often pleural adhesion left over from pleurisy. At this time, artificial pneumothorax is absolutely impossible to use, otherwise there may be a risk of pleural hemorrhage, and in fact, after the pleura adheres, it is often impossible to inject air, so you have to give up. Therefore, Acobeaus proposed to use surgery or electrocautery to peel off the adhesion, and then inject air into the pleural cavity. Unfortunately, this method can only be used in a very small range of adaptation. In fact, it is often "this road is impassable." Subsequently, Brauer (my mentor) and Sauerbruch advocated the use of rib resection, so that the chest cavity lost its ability to support the chest after the rib resection, thus obtaining the same compressive effect as artificial pneumothorax. This method is theoretically very successful, and in fact, many people have recovered from it. However, many people either cannot tolerate this operation or are afraid to move forward, or fortunately the operation is safe, but the disease remains the same and does not see any effect. Therefore, everyone returned to calcium and vitamin BC to seek treatment. Honestly, if a chronic tuberculosis patient can inject a large amount of glucose calcium and vitamin BC for a long time, and at the same time can cooperate with bed rest, recuperation, and improved nutrition, then many patients can recover from it. However, in fact, there are also many people who treat it according to the above methods and do not see any effect. Therefore, everyone is looking forward to the arrival of new specific medicine for lung disease. Since the invention of streptomycin, everyone has placed great expectations on it. However, it also has many shortcomings: first, it is so expensive that patients below the middle class cannot afford it (the current market price is more than 8 million yuan per tube of national currency, plus injection fees, etc., it costs at least about 10 million yuan, and each tube can only be used for one day, and at least 100 or 150 consecutive injections are required to see the effect); second, its effect is not absolute (some tuberculosis patients have no effect after injecting a lot of streptomycin); third, it needs to be injected six times a day, continuously for 100 or 150 days, this continuous pain is really enough for patients to endure; fourth, it sometimes has side effects such as dizziness or tinnitus. With the above shortcomings and financial losses (at least more than 1 billion yuan), we can know that it is not an ideal specific medicine.</p>
<p>The "Ebesal" mentioned in this article is a copper preparation; it is used to treat tuberculosis because an Italian doctor inadvertently discovered the fact that "workers who work in copper utensils all year round rarely suffer from tuberculosis." At that time, a copper preparation such as Lekutyl was being sold and used. (To be continued)</p>
<h3>A Casual Discussion on Pharmaceutical Education (Part 2)</h3>
<p>— Huang Mingju</p>
<p>To seek the development of pharmacy, there must be advanced research, and this kind of research must have a full-fledged pharmacy school to carry it out. On the one hand, it cultivates advanced pharmaceutical talents to establish the foundation of pharmaceutical education, and on the other hand, it engages in advanced research to start the development of the Chinese academic career. Talking about pharmaceutical research, it can be roughly divided into two ways, one is the research of chemical synthesis, and the other is the research of Chinese herbal medicine and its components. My country's transportation is not yet developed, and the production of medicinal materials is mostly concentrated in the northwest and southwest, while the supplies of scientific equipment are mostly circulated in the southeast. Therefore, at the beginning, the research on plant components should be in Southwest China, because of the convenience of obtaining materials and the suitability of planting. The research in chemistry should be established in East China and South China, because materials and talents are more concentrated. Once the transportation construction is completed, the research on chemical synthesis and plant components is suitable everywhere, regardless of geographical distinction. It is expected that at least ten pharmacy schools should be established within ten years. In the first five years, four should be established. One in Southwest China should be established in Xi'an, because it is close to Gansu, Xinjiang, Kang, and Tibet provinces, and the production of medicinal materials is very rich. One in East China should be established in Zhejiang, because the peaks of Tiantai and other peaks in the province, as well as the medicinal materials in Fujian and Jiangxi provinces, are all medicinal producing areas, and transportation is convenient and material transportation is easier. At the same time, the nine northeastern provinces and Taiwan should each establish one based on the existing pharmaceutical institutions in Japan. As for the pharmacy schools that should be gradually established in the second five years, there will be one in Nanjing, one in Hankou, one in Guangdong, one in Beiping, one in Chengdu, and one in Kunming. The above locations are either medicinal producing areas or convenient transportation, and materials are easy to collect. Once the number of talents increases, after ten years, it will be extended to every province to establish a pharmacy school, then the future pharmaceutical development will be very promising.</p>
<p>At present, the domestic situation regarding the use of pharmaceutical talents is extremely contradictory. On the one hand, it is said that there are not enough talents for many careers, whether in education, research, or law enforcement, all say that because there are no talents, they cannot start. On the other hand, the talents cultivated by various Chinese academic schools or pharmacy departments every year have problems with finding a way out, so many of them change careers. This is such a waste of talent. I believe that the Ministry of Education and the Ministry of Health should conduct a strict investigation and statistics on pharmaceutical talents, and contact each other. At the same time, all pharmaceutical education, pharmaceutical business, laws, etc., must be immediately promoted and implemented. Talents cannot sit and wait for the promotion of the business, and the business should not wait for talents to start. Any attempt must be done to be hopeful. If you use the waiting method, you will never move, then you will never reach the goal. Moreover, there are businesses that need to be done urgently here, and talents are also here. Just use them and you can promote them. At the same time, the Pharmaceutical Society should also take responsibility for the use of pharmaceutical talents, engage in investigation, statistics, introduction, and assist the government in developing pharmaceutical education and promoting pharmacy.</p>
<p>At present, there are indeed very few pharmaceutical teachers, but it is not difficult to recruit teachers for two or three pharmacy schools, but it depends on how the government uses them. As far as we know, many pharmaceutical teachers are absorbed by foreign countries to do their pharmaceutical research, and even do research on Chinese medicine for them. This strange phenomenon is probably rare in the world. If the government can feel the real need for scientific nation-building, can feel the seriousness of the past and present drug shortage, can feel the urgent need to cultivate advanced pharmaceutical talents, can feel ashamed of pharmaceutical teachers being used to study Chinese medicine, resolutely promote the education of pharmacy schools, and provide generous treatment and sufficient equipment for these teachers, so that they can work in the country with peace of mind, I think these pharmaceutical teachers abroad all have national concepts, especially after the victory, all eagerly hope to return to their hometowns and serve the country. Who would be willing to live in a foreign country and work for others!</p>
<p>In summary, pharmaceutical education—pharmacy schools—is the source of all pharmaceutical careers. If the foundation is not eradicated, then everything will never be developed and flourish. What is there to talk about scientific nation-building? I hope that our education authorities will humbly accept our suggestions, and I hope that our pharmaceutical comrades will work together.</p>

<h3>A Record of Sending Mr. San Yuan's Coffin to Hangzhou for Burial</h3>
<p>— Chen Yixian</p>
<p>Mr. Chen Sanyuan's coffin was transported from Tianjin to Shanghai by the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Xi Lin on June 15th, and then moved to the North Station. The Railway Bureau prepared a car, which was escorted to Huangni Ridge in Nanshan, Hangzhou by the three brothers Long Ke (Yan He), Fang Ke (Yan Tong), and Deng Ke on the 16th for burial. Yin Ke stayed in Tsinghua School in Beiping due to eye disease and could not come south. At 11:00 AM on the 15th, I, together with brothers Cang Qiu Weiming and Zhi An Bing Shu, went to the North Station to pay our respects.

After each person paid their respects, the Long Ke brothers invited us to rest in the flower car. Li Zubing, sent by the Ministry of Communications, also accompanied us to take care of everything, because the Minister of Communications Dawei is Mr. Sanyuan's son-in-law. Those who arrived on that day also included Li Bake, Chen Shutong, Ye Pusun and his son Congqi, Xia Jiancheng, Zhang Jusheng, Shen Kunshan, and Yuan Shinan.</p>
<p>More than 20 years ago, Mr. Sanyuan's wife was buried in Nanshan, Hangzhou. From her tomb, one could see a line of the Qiantang River, with sails clearly visible, and the scenery was excellent. At that time, I lived with my mother in the lake, and Mr. lived in Bai Chuan Road, Qixia Camp. I introduced Ma Zhuoqun to Mr. to discuss the purchase of land. Mr. Wang Bingshan determined the tomb and the mountain direction during the burial. He set two holes in the center, leaving the left one empty for Mr.'s grave. Heng Ke (Shizeng) was buried slightly below the main hole. Mr. passed away in Yaohua Hutong, Xicheng, Beiping before the Mid-Autumn Festival in August of the 26th year of the Republic of China. The coffin was parked in Changchun Temple for as long as 12 years. Now, in the autumn of the North China war, with traffic difficulties, he can actually be buried with his wife, all thanks to the efforts of Minister Yu of Communications.</p>
<p>When Mr. passed away, it was less than three months from the Japanese launching the July 7th Incident, and only one month from the Shanghai fire on August 13th. Reports stated that Mr. died of anorexia due to grief and indignation over current affairs. Mr., at the age of 85, was as passionate and enthusiastic as a youth, which is admirable and sad. Lu Fangweng's poem says, "When the king's army has pacified the Central Plains, do not forget to tell your father at the family sacrifice." Two years ago, Japan surrendered, and Mr. never saw it in person, which is a pity.</p>
<p>Mr.'s poems are published by the Commercial Press. My friend Yuan Bokui has a copy of Mr.'s essays. After Brother Bokui passed away, Brother Chen Bingshu took the manuscript to arrange it. For ten years, the price of paper and typesetting has risen endlessly, and there is no money to publish it for the time being, so it has not yet met the world. Although Mr. supported himself in his later years by helping with writing, he would not do it if it was not the right person. Zeng Gong's letter to Ouyang Sheren on epitaphs said: "Those who have morality will not accept and inscribe for the wicked, and they can distinguish them among the people. People's actions have feelings of kindness but the traces are not, intentionally treacherous but externally virtuous, there is a great difference between good and evil that cannot be really pointed out, there is reality greater than reputation, and there is reputation more extravagant than reality. Just like employing people, if you do not have morality, how can you distinguish it without confusion and discuss it without favoritism? If you are not confused and not favored, then you are fair and right, but if the words are not well written, then the world will not spread it, and it is also necessary to have both literary talent." Guang Sheng's article can truly be worthy of this statement without shame.</p>
<p>Mr.'s death was due to the Japanese invaders. In his prime, he assisted his father, Mr. Chen Youming, in the Hunan Governor's Office. All the new policies in Hunan were planned by Mr. Later, he was dismissed from his post (principal of the Ministry of Officials) due to the Kang Liang case and never came out for life. He loved the country and the nation, but he had no ambition. His name was all over the world, but he had no fame. The ancient texts were above the Bao Run Xuan, but he did not serve as Yuan Shikai's senator. His poems were as famous as the Hai Cang Lou, but he did not serve as the prime minister of the puppet Manchukuo. His character was noble and pure, and he was truly one of the late people. Anyone who sees Mr. for the first time will definitely feel that his appearance is modest, like an old Confucian scholar in a rural village, and his speech is peaceful, without any air of arrogance. Mr.'s scholarship is profound, so he is different from a group of celebrities.</p>
<p>I can only say this about Mr. Brother Cangqiu has a poem mourning Mr., which can well express Mr.'s life. It is recorded here to end this article:</p>
<p>The majestic pine tree, who are you in this world, the dream of the stone of Wang Feng, the experience of a lifetime of stretching. Giving up office is not for high, knowing no poverty in cutting off food, seeing people without mistakes, and being in harmony with the world. Pure heaven has no secrets, who can compare to the old generation, sincerity is connected through Qu Sao, and the talent is hanging on the horizon. High style is left in the world, so that I can praise it for thousands of years. (Written in the morning of the 16th after Mr. Sanyuan's hearse departed from the North Station to Hangzhou)</p>
<h3>A Tentative Translation of Blake's "Tiger" Poem</h3>
<p>— Zheng Xiaocang</p>
<p>Tiger lurking in the deep forest at night, its eyes shining like electric torches. What hands and eyes are so skillful as to cast such a majestic creature?</p>
<p>The electric torches illuminate the secluded valley, and suddenly rise to distant peaks. Do you still think of attaching wings? Who dares to try its edge?</p>
<p>Who used skill and strength to dare to stir the tiger's heart? Once your heart is stirred, who is not stripped of their courage?</p>
<p>Planning in the fiery furnace of the brain, the chaos is hammered. What anvil is used for the hundred refinements? How can you hold the fierce without fear?</p>
<p>The stars cast their spears, and tears rained from the heavens. Does the creator smile? Creating sheep and creating tigers?</p>
<p>Tiger lurking in the deep forest at night, its eyes shining like electric torches. Daring to encompass the sky, casting things like this!</p>
<h3>Talking About "Mother-in-Law"</h3>
<p>— You Mojun</p>
<p>The world calls the wife's mother "mother-in-law." There is a saying in Wu dialect, "The mother-in-law looks at the son-in-law, the more she looks, the more interesting he is." However, "mother-in-law" can also be used as a general term for women who are respected. The General Mirror records that Han Yu called Liu Xuanzuo's mother "mother-in-law." It can be seen from the Collection of Liu Ziyuan that the term "mother-in-law" for the wife's mother has a long history. As for why the word "mother" is used, it is based on the Book of Han, Biography of the Xiongnu, which says "The Han Emperor is my father-in-law" and is changed.</p>
<p>The wife's mother is called "Yue Mu," but I don't know what it means. One says that ancient poems say "Rooted in Mount Tai," which means marrying relatives. Mount Tai is one of the Five Mountains, so it is associated with calling the wife's father "Yue Weng" or "Yue Zhang" or "Mount Tai," and the wife's mother can be called "Yue Mu" or "Tai Shui." "Tai Shui" is even more unspeakable, because there is no such water name!</p>
<p>The most appropriate thing is to call the wife's mother "Wai Gu," although the Erya Shiqin says "The mother of the uncle is Wai Gu," but the uncle and aunt are opposite words. Sun Shuang's commentary on Mencius Wan Zhang's sentence "The emperor housed the nephew in the second room" said, "Rites say that the wife's father is Wai Jiu," so the wife's mother may as well be called "Wai Gu."</p>
<h3>Spiritual Food</h3>
<p>— Bao Zhongqi</p>
<p>These two days, rice prices have been rising sharply, and the market has been stirred up. All prices have also risen accordingly, and our spiritual food - books and newspapers - is naturally no exception, increasing by several percent, or even several times.</p>
<p>The most affected are of course us readers. Originally, we had some surplus money in our pockets, and when we passed by bookstores and newsstands, we could freely browse the newly published books and newspapers. If we were happy to see them, we would pick out two of our favorites and take them home. Holding a book, leaning against the window to read, or reading at night under the lamp, it was truly a pleasure.</p>
<p>However, our right to enjoy this quickly disappeared. We began to have no power to buy new books to read, sighing at the books with longing, and the bitterness and desire in our hearts were just like the people who were hungry and hoped to eat.</p>
<p>So, we moved our position and became regular customers of old book stalls. This time, we finally had a good time. There are also many good old books here. Not only can we often find out-of-print magazines that are valuable for reference, but also, as Mr. Jinjin wrote in this journal's "A Miracle," we often see new editions of magazines. At this time, the taste is really like discovering emerald in rough stone! As for if you can accidentally discover a literary work like Six Records of a Floating Life, it is only an unexpected harvest of digging cold stalls.</p>
<p>In fact, the publishing industry's downturn has forced books and newspapers to repeatedly reduce their size and increase their prices. Readers cannot afford it, and the number of sales is naturally light. Black characters printed on white paper are not as valuable as the original paper, and the biggest way for old books to go is to return to the paper mill by weight.</p>
<p>Therefore, old book stalls have become our only place to go.</p>
<p>Our spiritual food is running out, and we have become standard cultural refugees!</p>
<h3>The Problem of Old-Age Care in the United States</h3>
<p>— Mao Yi</p>
<p>Since the Industrial Revolution occurred, the development of capitalism has affected family economics and ethical concepts, thus giving rise to the small family system, followed by the question of how to support and arrange for the older generation.</p>
<p>The United States is a highly capitalist country, and its problem of old-age care is even more serious. In 1850, the elderly over 65 years of age accounted for only 3% of the US population. Today, their proportion has increased by 7%, reaching 10 million people. Due to scientific progress and improved health, the number of elderly people will only increase. However, although the number has increased, the number of elderly people who spend their lives in the homes of their children and grandchildren has decreased.</p>
<p>Most of the American elderly, about 4 million, rely on some form of organized alms to maintain their lives. A small portion of the elderly enjoy appropriate private subsidies, civil service retirement benefits, or veteran benefits. However, most of the elderly still eke out a living on an average of $30 per month in state and federal old-age relief or insurance benefits. The former is a distressing expedient, and the latter is simply a cruel and teasing prank.</p>
<p>It is terrible to be old and unfortunately economically strapped. Their last hope is to seek refuge in public or private "poorhouses." According to reports from all sides, most of these institutions where American elderly spend their lives are mostly the slums in Dickens's novels. And these institutions are overcrowded. So, what happens to those elderly who cannot enter these not-so-comfortable shelters? The head of a city poorhouse in a big city replied, "They die alone."</p>
<p>Old-age care is no less important than childcare. The younger generation is our new generation, but the older generation is our cultivators. What's more, each of us has a day to grow old!</p>
<h3>Pure and Lofty</h3>
<p>— Yi Jun</p>
<p>A: The academic exams are about to be held, right?</p>
<p>B: Yes, it starts on the 10th of this month and will be finished on the 11th.</p>
<p>A: Your studies are completed, congratulations!</p>
<p>B: Where? "Graduation is unemployment," it's very sad!</p>
<p>A: What about your work after graduation?</p>
<p>B: I'm working on it in all aspects, but I'm not sure yet.</p>
<p>A: What kind of work is it roughly?</p>
<p>B: I studied education, so of course I serve in the education field.</p>
<p>A: That's great, education work is so pure and lofty!</p>
<p>B: But it's too pure and hard.</p>
<p>A: Pure and hard is a little pure and hard, but all kinds of occupations are not as pure and lofty as your education field.</p>
<p>B: I have a little opinion about whether it is pure and lofty.</p>
<p>A: I would like to hear your opinion.</p>
<p>B: I think that the "occupation" itself is not pure or lofty, the question is what kind of "person" is engaged in the occupation? If the "person" engaged in the occupation is pure and lofty, then no matter what kind of occupation it is, it is pure and lofty; if the "person" engaged in the occupation is not pure and lofty, then no matter what kind of occupation it is, it is not pure and lofty.</p>
<p>A: That makes sense.</p>
<p>B: For example, in our education field, there are facts of corruption, extortion, academic shops, and rape. Can this be considered pure and lofty? There are also many loyal and honest officials in the officialdom. The principal of my junior high school, who served as a county magistrate, sold several acres of land in his family; my father served as the chief of general affairs for many years, but his official bag was empty. Can this also be said that being an official is not pure and lofty? In short, whether it is pure and lofty depends on what kind of "character" it is, not on what "occupation" it is.</p>
<p>A: What you said is very right, whether it is pure and lofty depends on "character." But there are also "occupations" that are not pure and lofty in themselves, such as gambling dens, brothels, and robbers.</p>
<p>B: But, for those occupations, my answer is that I don't recognize them as "occupations" at all. That is just a "crime" created by society.</p>
<h3>Preface to Deng Sanmu's Seal Collection</h3>
<p>— Posthumous work of Jin Songcen</p>
<p>Yang Weizhen of Tieya possessed the ghostly talent of Li He, composing small-scale Yuefu poems like Zhang Wang, delighting in the ancient, desolate, and strange, and calling it the "Tie" style. Iron, as a material, is extremely rigid. To be rigid yet capable of softness is the heart of a poet; to be soft yet capable of rigidity is the brush of a poet. As for calligraphers, the brush is soft and the paper is also soft, but what strengthens it is the wrist; as for seal carvers, the carving knife is rigid and the stone is also rigid, but what makes it resilient is also the wrist. Rigidity and softness are the nature of things, but as for making the soft rigid and the rigid soft, the mind governs it, the qi governs it. When the qi flows through the wrist and reaches the fingers, then things change their nature, and my art is achieved. I once heard that Mr. Deng Sanmu was proficient in all four styles of calligraphy, which did not strike me as particularly unusual. But when I passed by the Daxin Tea House and saw Mr. Deng's cursive script, I was astonished, thinking that since Meng Jin of Jingzhao, this level of attainment had been unmatched for nearly three hundred years, with no one able to continue its legacy. I never expected that in the midst of the dust and burial of society, such a remarkable talent would emerge. Shen Ziyu Zhong said: "Sanmu is an eccentric. He admires Mr. Jing's conduct and wishes to meet him but has no means to do so." In the mid-autumn of Renwu, I returned to the coastal regions, and the two men invited me to drink at Jixiang Temple, where the food was exquisite. I said: "This is like Deng Zhai." Someone said: "It's a pity there's no Milindapanha." A monk at the temple, who was fond of drinking, rolled up his sleeves and said: "There is." He went downstairs and brought a female painter from a birthday banquet in the neighboring courtyard (Sanmu's note: Ms. Zhou Yunxia). The guests clapped their hands and drank freely. Two days later, we gathered again at Sanmu's residence. At that time, the bandits were practicing night warfare, and we drank together by lamplight, our wills full of fervor. Sanmu's nature is strange and unusual, resenting the world and despising vulgarity, but lamenting his poverty, he cannot escape worldliness to respect himself, so he unleashes his talent in the arts: besides military books, his seal carving is renowned as an exceptional skill. One day, he sent me his completed seal collection, a total of four volumes. I repeatedly studied them carefully and realized that his knife technique comes from Zhao of Yushan, but with a focused and solitary mind, he is able to roam the halls of hundreds of masters, worryingly creating his own ancient style, not rigidly adhering to the methods of teachers. Therefore, the intricate patterns of interlaced silk are not sufficient to describe its exquisite quality; the swirling patterns of Xuan Yuan are not sufficient to describe its freshness; the pursuit of the bell is not sufficient to describe its antiquity; the inverted eggplant is not sufficient to describe its splendor; the fur coats and horses of the Three Rivers are not sufficient to describe its application; the ceremonial robes of the Emperor's daughter are not sufficient to describe its solemnity; the crumbling walls of ruined palaces are not sufficient to describe its mystery; the crude carvings of the Hongya are not sufficient to describe its artlessness. There is a saying: "Intelligence surpassing one's teacher is the only way to transmit the craft." Is it the result of mental effort? Is it a reward of qi? Sanmu does not know it himself, but I can recognize it. Picking up my writing brush, I come to inquire about Sanmu.</p>
<h3>Mr. Deng Sanmu (Gouweng)'s Poetry, Calligraphy, and Seal Engraving are Known Throughout the World. Starting Today, an Exhibition Will Be Held at the Chinese Painting Academy on Chengdu Road. Art Lovers, Please Don't Miss This Opportunity to Feast Your Eyes. This is a Recent Work Engraved by Mr. Deng.</h3>
