<h3>國大舉行第七次會議　聽取財經交糧報告　經濟政治今將合併檢討</h3>
<p>〔本報南京十三日電〕國大第七次會議十三日晨九時廿五分舉行，出席代表一七三人，第九組主席團輸值，主席何應欽主持開會後，通過上次會議紀錄，宣讀主席團報告三事：（一）代表賢格審委會委員名單，（二）豫代表張舫等三十三人臨時動議，請繼續進行十二日未畢之軍事檢討，經主席團決定在議程未變動前，當日仍照原定議程進行經濟報告及檢討，改期再行繼續軍事檢討，（三）豫·魯兩省代表各提速調大軍增援鄂·汴及昌·濰案，均已由主席團轉國防部，並已派專人向蔣主席報告。旋何主席宜布開始經濟報告，然冀·察·魯·豫及東北等區代表紛對主席團第二項報告表示異議，認爲華北岌岌可危，而戡亂期間軍事第一，在軍事檢討未畢前，不得進行其他項目，華北代表情緒高漲，豫省代表月幾退席，雖主席團報告已經表決爲大多數代表贊同通過，秩序仍零亂不堪，幸經張舫．薛篤弼·張振鷺等力勸，並決定主席團即可開會商討改變議程，衆憤始漸平息·至十時十五分，財長俞鴻鈞始四度立於發言台前開始財政報告，俞氏首闡明我國經濟基礎本極薄弱，而勝利後百廢特舉，復員及戡亂之必要，支出又極浩繁，財政方面隊儘量緊縮發行，增加稅收外，並將利用四億六千三百萬美元之援助物資，穩定物價，收回法幣·關於施政槪况，渠分四點報告：（一）國庫之收支雖難相符，但赤字之百分比尚較戰前通常之百分之三十爲少·（二）改革稅收以直接稅爲主，所得稅征收辦法之　進可期有效，關稅則在不放棄保護政策原則下，擬制適合國內外情形之新稅則，以謀增加稅收。走私問題，亦正謀在港澳合作下嚴防杜絕·鹽稅稅率已增至每担四十五萬元，較戰前僅增十萬餘倍，現爲增加稅收，正推行產銷貸款，除長蘆·淮海等產區治安已請國防部注意外，並已進行在華南沿海推進增產工作·此三稅及貨物稅爲中央財政收人大宗，然實不足應付需要，且於戡亂戰事中受損頗大。（三）金融措施之推行，以配合財政爲原則，貸款仍限以生產事業爲對象，取締投機及非法經營等工作仍積極繼續，以减少游資穩定市塲。至法幣之發行總額，渠保證截至上月底尚未達七十萬億，政府現正變賣敵偽資產，以充實法幣基礎。關於爲鼓勵輸出採行之外匯市價率機動調整辦法影響物價一點，正擬設法改善。（四）地方財政已另定收支系統，可望充裕地方財源。俞氏報告歷時四十分鐘，至十時五十五分報告畢，何主席宣告休息·十時廿分讀會，何主席報告適間主席團集議，決定當日午後議程改軍事檢討，經濟　討與十四日政治檢討合併舉行，如時間不　　敷，延至十八日晨繼續，此項決定經會衆無異議接受後，由經·交·糧長先後作施政報告。</p>
<p>經濟部長陳啓天先聲明，經濟政策係以行政院擬定經國務會議通渦之無濟改革方案爲依據，配合戡亂動員，經濟部之工作重心一爲扶助工商業增加生產，一爲發展國際貿易，平衡對外收支，偏於行政方面而不問業務。旋談及華東·淮南兩煤礦增產收效頗宏，紡紗出口營利亦達三千萬美元，並於分析物價暴漲原因後，强調剿滅共匪，增加法幣準備，增加生產與善用外援爲主要平抑方法。</p>
<p>交通部長俞大維以數目字報告交通現况，鐵路原有三萬餘公里，其中東北之一萬一千公里，原已收復通軍三千公里，現僅餘六百公里，全國鐵路被匪破壞達六千餘次，路長五千餘公里，現尚通車者爲一萬三千公里，新綫之修築，廣州灣至迪化之幹綫將分六段完成，黔桂段都勻貴陽間短期內即可通軍·公路情形除新疆現已有路一千六百公里外，內地情况無何新開展，水運現有總噸位一百零三萬噸，至於郵電年來本服務目標積極求進步，較過去發達甚大，去歲郵件總數達十德件，鄕村郵政亦正努力發展中。</p>
<p>糧食部長俞飛鵬糧政報告，關於軍糧之籌措，雖自三十六年重辦徵實徵借，然四千萬市石之鉅額仍屬不敷，去秋以後陝，豫，鄂，皖等省受匪竄擾，糧源損失更多，各省賦額復難望收足，供應益覺困難，去冬·今春均以向產糧區採購方資彌補。公敎民糧之配售，除難民救濟由社會部統籌辦理外，京，滬，平，津，穗五市之全面配售業已開始，各地民食之調劑，亦於四聯貸款協助下勉力辦理，今後糧政將以增加生產，利用外糧及厲行節約求其寬裕之道，十二時十分午前會議於俞氏報告畢宣告散會。</p>
<p>下午變更議程　繼續檢討軍事</p>
<p>下午三時半續會，依午前經大會同意變更之議程，繼續作軍事檢討，主席余家菊宣布以要求先後爲序，每單位由兩代表發言，劉藝舟等十七人依次對軍事問題提出意見·河南劉藝舟指出，中原必須確保，國軍兵力不敷，嚴重殊甚，主張爭取時間，在江南編訓一百師或兩百師勁旅，以鞏固華南，救援華北。何佛情主張應嚴明賞罰，以振軍心，而符民意。渠稱：「傳作義將軍茍有功，應增撥新武器裝備，勿作空言之嘉許，而陳誠將軍果有過，亦不應使其一走了之」。蒙古代表紀貞甫舉遼北王爺廟自治問題，指責主持東北接收之軍政負責人疏忽，致於欲用地方武力時已不可能。足克巴岡爾强調蒙胞居地為員家北疆門戶，扶助蒙胞，正所以保衛邊地，政府應不分畛域，迅速重視，並利用蒙胞騎射技能，愛國熱誠？配備武裝，以保其本身安全，共擔國防　責。渠之言諭博得全體鼓掌。山西楊懷豐，王謙分別陳述臨汾，大同兩區域戰略地位之重要，呼籲救援。陝西黨積齡，王凡指出，陝南共匪猖獗，已影響關中安全，負作戰責任者，不能再延誤隱瞞。察哈爾張體方，唐鴻業報告張家口已四面被圍，最近之匪距城僅廿五里，此皆駐察國軍外調，防務空虛，而地方壯丁抽盡，自衛無力所致，保衛熱·察，方能保衛平·津，政府應全力支援傳作義確守張垣。下午四時三刻一度休息後，綏遠劉挂蘭等續爲傳氏請命，並主張對陝北作戰最力之鄧寶珊·馬鴻逵等部都應撥與新式裝備。吉林劉榮博指出，東北甚多可用民力，然迄未被注意利用，可惜亦復可悲。合江劉守剛提出四點意見：（一）東北·華北並重，然東北又重於華北。（二）國家與地方武力並重，然地方武力又重於國家武力。（三）戰術應配合戰略。（四）軍事應配合政治。並提出應以大會名義電慰衛立煌及堅守長春之李鴻。合江于歸指責東北國軍守不勝守，從未計及進迫共匪要害。安東崔榮對態式輝·陳誠兩氏猛烈抨擊後宣稱：兩氏應負責三事：（一）貽誤軍機，（二）失賽一民心，（三）變像製造匪軍。渠並質問何以白部長軍事報告　對東北戰事一字不提，政府是否將放棄東北。最後提出起用東北人號召民衆規復家鄉爲東北唯一出路。河北韓松年謂：華北緊急，由於一東北局勢惡化迭成，東北時局熊式　應負全責。渠稱：「此種人士再予以高官厚　，國家前途　不堪設想」。山東孔福民主張整飭政風軍紀，各級行政應有實權，　有效推行政令，後方工廠·學校應嚴密組織，絕不能被共匪鑽隙　　利用。熟河孫明伋稱：熱河分隸兩行轅殊不合理，十三軍孤軍駐守，七百五十萬人民政府要否？至下午六時討論臨時動議兩項：一為提供　亂有效辦法，決定由主席團交秘書處轉送政府注意，一爲請選總主委張厲生報告選務，決定交主席團研究處理辦法，六時一刻散會。</p>

<h3>國大紀程　軍事重於經濟</h3>
<p>〔本報特寫〕當東北·華北·中原到處戰事緊張的時候，在討論行憲的國民大會堂裏，「軍事第一」的口號又重新被喊了出來。昨日，軍事檢討的舌劍唇搶，還沒有得到充分的發洩，今天上午進行經濟報告時，代表們便　求繼續檢討軍事，經濟報告尚未開始，棋上下響澈着「不許報告」的聲浪；「軍事重於經濟」，今天是由代表們的情緒中充分表現出來了。　今天大會由新近自美返國的何應欽將軍任主席，雖然他是一位久經戰陣並曾任八年抗戰參謀總長的軍事要員，但今天的塲面也令他感覺難於控制。他報告河南代表張舫等三十三人臨時動識，請繼續檢討軍事，經主席圖決定定期檢討，樓上立時　起反對之聲，察哈爾代表王勉之，張秉武首先發難，高呌「爲什麼不讓我們講話？白部長昨天報告沒有報告華北，是不是不要華北了？」春風乍起，一池春水，立時波浪　樣了。全場東北·華北代表，此呼彼應，何應欽連忙解釋：主席　業已接受繼續檢討的建議，但今天的議事日程，是經濟報告，軍事檢討須暫　。財政部長俞　鈞，仍走上發言台，剛開始一句：「今天奉命報告財政，我國財政　　可極薄弱！」馬上又爲「軍事檢討未完，不准報告」的聲浪所淹沒，只得退下台來。何應欽把議程問題訴諸表決，澯爛的四色燈表決器上，閃爍發光，說　一六三人贊成不變更議　。主席帶着勝利的微笑，再講俞部長報告，場內也激起了一陣激烈的掌聲。台下後面則又大呼「我們要退席」！俞部長只好再搖着頭，由發言台退了回去。開會後已是半小時了，樓上樓下喊成一團，許多代表立起來，似在準備退席。主席第二次請俞部長報告，這次却是被遼寗代表王今文所阻斷。會塲秩序幾乎不堪維持了。何應欽一再敲着木魚，張舫·薛篤弼·張振鷺·林紫貴等也跑到後面苦苦的勸請北方代表不必退席，經過了數十分鐘的混亂，俞部長才第四次登台完成了他的報告。休息十分鐘時，主席團開會，接受代表們「軍事重於經濟」的意見，決定下午繼續檢討軍事，讓上午的剩餘時間，由陳啓大·俞大維·俞飛鵬三部長各以十五分鐘完成了經濟報告，而把經濟檢討移到明天。</p>
<p>下午雨過天靑，代表們利用這爭取來的時間，對過去軍事措施的不滿，續作抨擊·十七位代表，先後發言，除去掌聲外，始終平靜無彼。休息時間以後，會塲內代表稀疏可數，幾乎不滿千人，似乎檢討也成了「疲勞轟炸」。十七位發言的，都是北方代表，他們一面檢討北方軍事得失，一面爲華南作未雨綢繆·熱河代表孫明，就提醒大家，要檢討一下華南是不是已有預防共匪的辦法？不少代表提出補救過去缺點的對策，要求要武裝龍打共匪的部隊。綏遠代表蘇珽和劉桂等，都一再為傳作義求援，希望中央能給他以優良的裝備。「武器給傅總司令，他是不會送給共產黨的」。全塲立時泛起熱烈的掌聲。河北代表閻松年，嚴詞責備態式輝誤國。　聲中，聽到打倒態式輝的叫喊。山東代表孔福民，巷王耀武抱不平，說他連用縣長的權都沒有時，會塲中又寄予同情。代表們呼籲着，要明賞罰。整個下午的軍事檢討中，已表示出過去軍事負責者的功罪是非來。（四月十三日於南京）</p>

<h3>社論　注視暹羅政局的動向</h3>
<p>逼羅自去年十一月問發生政變，由乃寬亞拜續組織臨時政府，直到今年三月初，始獲得衆議院的信任，及中·英·美·法四國政府的承認：但是爲時僅三十多天；暹羅忽又發生了政變，乃寬總理在軍人壓迫下辭職，而由政變領袖即國防軍總司令　披汶東山再起，負賣組織新內閣，內閣的人選雖已內定，但尚未作最後的決定，中暹邦交又復陷於停頓狀態了，但是中暹關係，不僅有關暹羅的經濟發展，而且爲我國旅暹華僑三百五十萬人的生存所繫。因爲鑾披汶是排斥華僑的極端份子，對於我國僑胞曾採用種種不平等的立法，壓迫我僑胞的敎育，束縛我僑胞的經濟活動，甚至曾頒佈過一種驅逐我僑胞出境的緊　治法令。這些充滿血和淚的痛苦經驗，使我們對於鑾披汶組閣的動態，不得不予以密切的注視，對於我旅暹僑胞三百五十萬人的命運，更不可不特別提高警覺了。</p>
<p>鑾披汶十日招待記者，對於中暹兩國間可能發生事件，也曾表示十二分的關切，他說：『暹羅政府正在研究他國之移民法以及其他法律，以解決在暹的華僑問題。』同時並承認中國人對他沒有好感，因此他深恐『稍有錯誤，即可能引起動亂。』我們根據路透肚道個簡單的報道，也就不難預料到未來的中暹關係如何發展了。</p>
<p>這次政變的經過，是這樣的：四月六日爲暹節廈皇朝建國一百六十六年紀念日，攝政會議全體人員在曼谷河畔建國之拉瑪帝銅像前行禮之際，城內忽發生重大事變，軍人集團挾武裝向內閣總理乃寬亞拜橫，提出最後通牒，要求政府辭職，另由賢才執政。通牒內容計八點，抽象而不具體，人事多於政策，乃寬毫不抗拒，接受了辭職，七日國務會議開會，乃寬提出內閣辭職，國務會議拒絕接受，幾陷僵局。同日下午攝政會任命　披汶組織新閣，十日新閣大體組織就緒。於是乃要求國會於十五日投票信任新閣，他更要求各國承認新政權。各國對暹羅這次政變的態度，迄今未作表示，大約要靜觀暹局內部的變化</p>
<p>鑾披汶是暹羅極端派和軍人的領導者，在太平洋戰爭期問，他以獨裁政權的姿態，曾有「東方墨索里尼」之稱。其執政期內，對外排英美親軸心，對內排　華僑，倡言「太泰主義」，視華人如寇仇。大戰後，暹羅極權政治崩潰，鑾一度被拘，旋又釋放。　伏櫪不久，便又思動，初則組織保守黨，意圖捲土重來，嗣因組黨失敗，乃陰謀領導軍人於去年十一月八日晚，以半小時的不流血政變，推翻了鑾貧隆政府，甚至前總理叨比里，亦聞變出走。事變後，由於國際輿論的壓迫，擁出了民主黨領袖乃寬，負責組織臨時政府，但各國並未予以承認。今年一月二十九日舉行普選，成立新議會。乃寬護得民選的勝利，壓倒了鑾披汶的競選，乃寬於二月二十日奉命組閣，三月五日國內議會投票信任，三月六日各國政府予以承認，爲暹羅合法的政府。</p>
<p>所以這次政變，最值得注意的，是國際因素大于國內因素·乃寬很瞭解這點，所以他願自動下台。現階段的國際大勢，走向了兩極化，「紅色政變」在中東歐佔發絕對的優勢，到了最近，號稱中東歐民主堡壘的捷克，亦於一夜的政變之中，宣告死刑。世界各地有不少的人們，對紅色威脅深感不安，鑾披汶是富有敏感的人，他目擊世局的趨勢，便認爲有機可乘，乃以反共爲烟幕，用武力壓迫乃寬政府辭職。政變之後，　披汶本人也說：「新政府施政方針，旣不偏左又不向右，余個人係一主張反共者。」暹羅國內共黨勢力並不十分强大，在內政上並不　採取反共政策，政變豈非庸人自擾？所以他透澈底說明了反共的抱負，他宣佈說：「暹羅境內今日唯一的左翼色彩，僅爲曼谷蘇聯公使館屋頂上的紅旗·」由此足見鑾披汶的反共，是一種煙幕，是一種籍口，我們千萬不可相信。</p>
<p>由上所述，鑾披汶以「反共」爲名而逞其奪取政權的野心，是昭然若揭的，英美法荷各國對於暹羅政變的發展，自較我們看得還要淸楚，我們希望各國政府當局，對於鑾被汶的政治野心，應該特別注意，千萬不可上當，馬上就予以承認；否則這次政變，就要變成暹羅民主的喪鐘了，此在我國外交當局，尤應特別愼重，在沒有取得鑾披汶保證今後不再借屍還魂另訂東縛華僑法令之前，是萬萬不能承認鑾披汶政府的。同時在外交上，更應積極活動，聯合英·美·法·荷各國，一致對付鑾披汶，務使暹羅的民主不受摧殘，同時也須使我三百五十萬僑胞的生命獲有切實保陣！</p>

<p>〔本報廣州十一日航訊〕如果我們由廣州經水路到香港，沿着珠江南下，大約走上一半路程，泥黃色的江水，漸漸便會變爲碧綠，黃綠兩色之間，劃出一道天然的界錢，這便是珠江下游的盡頭，在那裏，我們便會發現一個海峽，兩邊有若龍蟠虎踞的羣山環抱，中間露了一個缺口，這便是扼珠江咽喉的虎門要塞，也就是南中國的大門。她與珠江口外的香港澳門並峙，形勢非常險要。自從遜淸順治八年開始，即設兵駐防，中間歷經鴉片戰爭及抗日諸戰役，曾給予敵人很大的打擊，可見其在軍事地理上的價值。現在把守着這國門的「司閣」，就是虎門要塞可令部。</p>
<p>小型炮艇五小時</p>
<p>我們事前得到要塞令令部的同意，到這富有歷史性的要塞去參觀，坐的是海軍第四基地司令部的小型砲艇，乘風破浪地駛了五個鐘頭，離開廣州已經四十浬了，那便是東莞縣屬的太平鎭，就是虎門要塞可令部所在地。我們捨舟登陸，看見鎭上雖然祗有兩條大街，但酒樓茶館和戯院的嘈雜，和街上行人熙來攘往，却熱鬧非常，這地方是離東莞縣城六十華里，亦可從陸路直達香港，交通十分便利，所以商業也很繁盛。鎭上的太平公園，是革命先烈朱執信先生當年殉難的地點，現在豎着一個紀念碑，碑旁便是「執信紀念醫院」，都是後人爲景仰先烈所興建的。從那裏北望不遠，有一個很大的村落，呌做虎門寨，據說原有一千多幢房子，但在淪陷期間都給敵人摧毀得凈盡無餘了。</p>
<p>龐然大物話炮臺</p>
<p>太平鎭僅是虎門要塞的司令台，所有砲台都分別設在十幾里外的海口處，比較著名的有「沙角」，「大角」，「咸勝」，「威遠」，「遂雷」等砲台，其中最大的要算「沙角」，距太平鎭十六華里，那地方是當年林則徐熒燒鴉片的所在，現在還有一個「林公則徐紀念碑」，屹立海干，供人憑弔。旁邊有幾門廢砲，橫陳地上，其中一門有二丈多長，據說是德國克處伯廠的產品，可是時代的變遷與科學的進步，使它成爲祗堪供人賞玩的古砲了。在紀念碑後面，是「瀕海台」，有石級可登，穿過一條曲折陰森的隧道，出去便是砲台，再上則是指抓所。那裏地勢較高，幾間屋子築在綠蔭樹下，枕山面海，環境淸幽，假如不是四周陳着龐然大物的巨砲，却很容易使人意味到這是一個掛在海角的別墅。</p>
<p>天險要塞鎖重門</p>
<p>照虎門的形勢全圖來看，彷彿一個大門以內，還有幾道小門。「沙角」和「大角」對峙着，好像一對蟹鉗形狀，這便是最外邊的大門，進去還有下橫檔，上橫檔，大虎山，小虎山等東重內門，假如重門深　起來，敵人的確不越　池半步，所以說它是一個天險的要塞。祗可惜的，經過淪陷之後，因爲日人常時佔了香港，認爲虎門便失了軍事價值，把要塞上面的重砲完全搬走，其餘的也澈底破壞，使這要塞變成荒地。直到勝利以後，我們才把它規復。要塞司令部在卅五年六日恢復成立，一方面編練部隊，修建營舍，一方面派員分赴武漢·廈門·海南島等地，領運奉發的火砲。這工作是相當艱巨的，他們曾因工作努力而獲上峯嘉許。宋子文主粵後，對這國防要塞，尤爲重視，最近更請准中央，核定該部增編守備第三大隊，要塞砲一大台，並增設雷達七副，這使要塞的設備，更臻完善。</p>
<p>守備綏靖一身兼</p>
<p>虎門要塞的轄區範圍頗大，包括了東　和賓安兩縣，分爲：（一）要塞本區（以司令部現在所在地爲中心半徑卅華里內地區），（二）前進要塞區（唐家灣，　淇澳，伶仃島至南頭地區），（三）聯立要塞（大亞灣地區）等三大區。他們的轄區遼闊，所以他們除了「守備」以外，還要擔任綏靖工作。去年三月，他們奉令擔任中山。順德·東莞·寶安·四縣的綏靖任務，同年十一月，因大鵬灣北岸共匪設卡收稅，藉此充實經費，擴張實力，他們又奉派前赴將匪掃蕩，並協助海關恢復設卡，歷次均獲預期効果，曾受國防部一嘉獎記功。</p>
<p>海岸大要塞計劃</p>
<p>行轅宋主任以粵港交界的深圳站，地位重要，最近又着該要塞的張宗良可令進駐深圳，統一指揮當地軍警憲兵，以確保地方安全，這任務更爲重要</p>
<p>此外，他們還有一個將虎門要塞成立新型的海岸大要塞的計劃，將廢除過去的「閉鎖式」，轉而採用「展開式」，並將火砲位置重新決定。這計劃最近已經國防部核准，正在按步建設中，不久的將來，我們這道南邊的大門，當然將更形鞏固了。</p>

<h3>共產黨煽動世界革命　馬歇爾嚴辭譴責　智利採取緊急防共措施</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕紐約十三日廣播：桑地哥訊，智利政府木日宣佈，哥倫比亞之暴動，係共黨企圖在智利與玻利維亞發動類似行動之一部份。維臺拉總統今日召集高級軍警長官舉行會議，以便採取緊急國防措置，因外傳共黨擬於五月一日在智利發動陰謀之故。總統辦公處于表聲明稱，此項消息係自最近就逮之共黨首領之文件中獲得。</p>
<p>〔聯合肚波哥大十三日電〕美國務卿馬歇爾昨晚首次向出席泛美會議之其他各國代表發表聲明稱，此間局勢與引起法議等國罷工及企圖妨害義大利選舉之事件，同出一型。我人在此間採取行動時，務須明白此為一世界事件，不僅限於哥倫比亞或拉丁美洲。各國代表中以此次革命公然歸咎於世界共產主義，並間接歸咎於莫斯科者，以馬歇爾為第一人。馬氏認為共黨故意策動革命，以期破壞泛美大會，困竊西方世界，並影響義大利選舉。各國代表決留此問開會，預料今日可以正式通過。</p>
<p>〔路透社波哥大十二日電〕汎美會議之繼續在波哥大舉行，美國曾竭力主張，藉以完成汎美組織公約及通過譴賣共產主議及表示決予取締之決議案，以向世界顯示汎美之團結。波哥大之緊張局勢雖减輕，然襲擊事件仍不時發生，商業仍陷於停頓狀况。陸軍控制區已逐漸擴大，城內糧食仍缺，街頭屍體已逐漸淸除。由於戒嚴法之施行，市內每一階層之生活幾全在陸軍掌握中，街頭行人時遭陸軍搜查。在汎美會議開會處之週圍，禁止閑雜人等通過。外國記者估計此次事變以來，死者共達五百人，波哥大財產損失達一千萬美元。</p>
<h3>猶太人宣布復國　并在聖地組織臨時政府　阿軍加緊包圍耶路撒冷</h3>
<p>〔合衆社耶路撒冷十三日電〕猶太公會發言人十三日告記者會議稱；巴勒斯坦之分治業已獲成功，猶太國亦已成立，並進行組織臨時政府。猶太國將由一十三人之內閣包括總統一名管制。該政府設置外交·國防·經濟及移民·工商·勞工·農業及漁業。公共工程·內政·司法·敎育及衛生等部。</p>
<p>在臺拉維夫具行之猶太復國大會，業已休會，將於聯合國特別會議之後重開·該會已拒絕美國之託管聖地建議，並抉澤閣員於英國之統治結束後接管巴勒斯坦中之猶太國。</p>
<p>〔路透社耶路撒冷十三日電〕猶太建國委員會已宣布在台拉維夫成立巴勒斯坦猶太國之臨時政府委員會，同時巴勒斯坦境內猶阿雙方之戰鬥已達愈演愈劇之程度。阿拉伯解放軍之七五米厘口徑大砲，已移置耶城西郊之茹丹山上，轟擊耶城近郊之猶太村落，以報復猶太伊爾根及史德恩黨之屠殺阿拉伯呂爾雅辛村之阿婦孺。同時猶阿兩軍為爭取台拉維夫，耶路撒冷公路之控制權，已在公路兩側演出激烈之爭奪戰。猶太哈迦那軍一度突入公路側之阿拉伯城萊姆萊城及若干阿拉伯村落，耶城西郊之卡洛那村經猶太軍猛攻後已被佔領。</p>
<p>〔路透社開羅十三日電〕阿聯盟已在進行其計劃，俾設立巴勒斯坦阿拉伯臨時政府，同時並已令阿人民軍總司令開入耶路撒冷，以制止猶太人之攻擊。前伊拉克陸軍司令沙夫華特將軍將率全體參謀人員自叙利亞移駐巴勒斯坦，此舉表示阿拉伯將拒絕停戰，加緊包圍耶路撒冷。</p>
<h3>史達林論蘇芬關系</h3>
<p>謂大國小國可以平等</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕倫敦十三日廣播：莫斯科訊，四月七日史達林設宴招待芬蘭代表團時，曾表示意見謂，苟能具有充份時間並作不斷努力，國與國間之猜疑可以消釋。此項意見，對於减輕東西間猜疑心理，流露一綫希望。按史達林自去年會晤史泰遜時就國際間題發表意見後，一向保持緘默，此次尙為第一次表示意見。</p>
<p>〔路透社倫敦十三日電〕莫斯科電台今日初次發表史達林元帥於四月八日蘇芬互助條約簽字時之致辭，謂大部份强國之政治家均以高傲之態度，鄙視小國，僅蘇聯則認蘇芬條約為兩平等國家間的條約。史達林稱：「此條約乃兩國關係之轉捩點，一百五十年來俄芬間互不信任，余極願兩國今後即可放棄過去的長期不信任，進入互相信任的新關係，兩國間所訂之條約必須擊破此項不信任而建立兩國民族間關係的新基礎。吾人希望今日在此之諸位，以及芬蘇國外其他人等均能了解此點，許多人均不信大國與小國間能建立平等關係，僅蘇聯人民相信可以使此等關係存在，蘇聯人民認爲不論大小均有其特性，非他國所能有，因此各國均應一律平等，故芬蘭雖屬小國，蘇聯仍以平等國家視之而與其簽訂條約」。</p>
<h3>美礦工潮結束</h3>
<p>〔合衆社匹資堡十三日電〕美煤礦聯合工會主席魯易士領導下之四十萬烟煤礦工，為要求養老金每年一千二百元，罷工有廿儿日，於十三日宣吿復工·本　凡尼亞·伊里諾·印弟安納·西浮琴尼亞及西部諸州礦工數千人已復工。然匹資堡區鋼鐵廠所經營之大礦數處，則仍未復工，靜待工聯會分會之投票表決。</p>
<h3>哥斯達黎加　亦發生革命　圖推翻左派政府</h3>
<p>〔合衆社危地瑪拉京城十三日電〕據此間十三日接獲之消息稱，在哥斯達黎加等候已久之右派攻　　　　　，　臘臘崙　震正在準備逃亡闕外·據稱，發格上校之叛軍已攻佔大西洋沿岸之列寗港，幷向京城之門戶卡德哥城郊推進中。傳　　之　　已失火，但仍能守住。該國京城聖若瑟已入混亂狀　。政府官員正在收集其財產以便難國。</p>
<h3>詹森出使巴西</h3>
<p>〔路透社華盛頓十二日電〕杜魯門總統頃任命前美駐華大使詹森為駐巴西大使，以繼因健康關係而辭職之保萊。詹森原任駐安理會副代表，服務外交界已有廿八年歷史。</p>
<h3>西歐十六國會議　週五在巴黎舉行　五國盟約問題亦在討論之列</h3>
<p>〔合衆社倫敦十三日電〕英外部發言人十三日證實，簽訂西歐盟約之五個西方國家之代表，將於十六日在巴黎討論該條約之實施。渠稱，外部仍未能說明將舉行之新西歐聯盟之性質，此一問題及議事日程之詳情現經由外交途徑談判中。</p>
<p>渠稱，貝文外相將於十五日晚離赴巴黎，但此並非此次會議係外長階級之謂，蓋比外長不致出席會議，其他國家之外長可能亦不致出席。貝文外相將於廿四日返倫敦。</p>
<p>〔路透社柏林十二日電〕十六國外長於星期五在此舉行大會時，相信貝文與皮杜爾將乘此機會，一談蘇聯最近在柏林之行動。倫敦方面最近已益信蘇聯有强迫西方强國退出柏林之意，然週末蘇聯在柏林及維也納所採之新行動，並未為英官方過份重視。外傳英美法三國外長將立即舉行會議，討論蘇聯行動之說，亦已經英法外交部鄭重否認。</p>
<h3>限制奧境交通　英向蘇抗議　鐵路交通已恢復常態</h3>
<p>〔路透社維也納十二日電〕英駐奧高級專員蓋洛威，為蘇聯採取限制維也納與英軍區間交通之新措施，不承認原有通行證之有效，要求附有本人照片之派司事，已於今日向蘇聯駐奧高級專員柯拉索夫提出抗議。</p>

<h3>美軍事領袖一致主張　擴充陸海空實力　福萊斯特稱蘇已知原子彈秘密</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕紐約十三日廣播：華盛頓訊，空軍部長辛明頓今日吿衆院軍委會稱，蘇聯正建造世界最大之空軍，　覆其軍用機超過美國十二倍，而謀在空中與美國決定勝負。辛氏力促通過建立七十個空軍大隊之計劃，並謂美國必須在空軍方面取勝，陸軍方面無法與蘇聯競爭·據謂目下蘇聯有陸軍一百師，而其衛星國家亦有七十五師云。</p>
<p>〔路透肚華盛頓十二日電〕衆院軍委會對徵兵案辯論甚烈，國防部長福萊斯特今日出席陳述意見，力言美國如能率直表示決不容忍歐洲西方文明之遭破讓，和平即可獲得。此非經常期消耗戰爭而獲得的和平，乃為侵略者預先獲得警吿而造成的和平。福氏强調需要强力空軍及陸軍以保護基地，足以維護海上交通的張大海軍及一中央諜報機構之必要。福萊斯特並吿軍委會稱，據原子專家研究及發展局主席布許博士所知，蘇聯已知製造原子彈之科學智識及手續，但尙無工業能力以製造之。</p>
<h3>美大選測驗　杜威艾帥有望</h3>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓十三日電〕衆院共和然議員約半數認為本屆總統候選人中，以紐約州長杜威最有當選希望，民主黨議員則約五分之一　爲前陸軍參謀總長艾森豪戚　最有希望，此次輿論測驗係由伊力諾州共和黨職員布斯貝主持，並經衆院派員檢查以影公允。</p>
<h3>新聞自由會議　通過數項決議</h3>
<p>〔合眾社日內瓦十二日電〕國際新聞自由會議十二日再將新聞自由加以四項合法限制。印度建議對「處罰意圖破壞政府與人民間情誼之歪曲報導之辦法」予於放寬，美國提出反對。法制委會以十三對三票通過該案，十票　權，英國亦投贊成票。該會復通過各政府得以罰款或限止等，處罰加諸登載下列各種新聞之報館：（一）有關國家安全必須保守秘密之各種文件；（二）侵害他人著作權之文字；（三）損害他人名譽而對公眾有害無益之文字。</p>
<p>〔路透社日內瓦十二日電〕　合國新聞自由會議，今日討論法國可提授權政府得以答覆國外所發表虛偽報道之案，東歐集團各國於此均持異議，指出由於缺乏國際機構以執行糾正此項虛偽報道之任務，該案實等於虛設。</p>
<h3>捷普選期展延</h3>
<p>〔合衆社普拉格十三日電〕捷克政府決定將普選展期一週。普選原定五月廿三日舉行，現已延期至三十日。蓋投票將與在普拉格舉行之斯拉夫農　展覽會之閉幕典禮相牴觸。</p>
<h3>美議員聯名要求　修改聯合國憲章　廢除否決權設置國際軍</h3>
<p>〔路透社華盛頓十二日電〕共和黨參議員福凱森頃向參院提出決議案，要求立即修改聯合國憲章，以為「對於蘇聯的新答覆」。該決議案已擭十四洲之參議員十六人的支持，其中要求廢除安理會中對於侵略，準備侵略及新會員國聲請加入聯合國等問題之否決權。該決議案此外並建議設立國際警察軍，以一國際部隊為常備軍，其他五强之部隊為後備軍，常備軍悉以小國之志願兵充任之。</p>
<p>〔中央社成功湖十二日電〕聯合國觀察家指出美外交政策之主要領袖如馬歇爾及范登堡等人，均反對修改憲章，而聯合國多數官員咸深恐國會對世界組織作基本修改一事所提之任何建議，其結果縱不成功，亦將造成聯合國急速之破裂。十七參議員之意見，雖可明白代表一强大之趨勢，但目前極少有由國會採納之機會。</p>
<h3>義總理接受共黨挑戰　抵米蘭發表演講　共黨號召罷工終於失敗</h3>
<p>〔路透肚羅馬十三日電〕議總理加斯貝利接受議共領袖托格利亞蒂之挑戰，定於十三日赴義北共黨勢力雄厚之米蘭發表演說。加氏現在全國巡迴演講，原定下次演說在西西里發表，後以托格里亞蒂日昨曾暗示加斯貝利不敢在米蘭發言，加氏遂臨時決定赴米關。義大利進入普選前的最後一週時，共黨領導的總工會會於十二日通令實施一小時的總罷工，以測騐實力。</p>
<p>〔聯合社羅馬十三日電〕義大利工會昨日號召之全國總罷工一小時已歸失敗，祗有一處曾因反共發生暴動。</p>

<h3>陳納德將軍　論美國對華政策</h3>
<p>克里浦斯霍華特系報業聯合會版權所有</p>
<p>本報編譯室譯</p>
<p>（十八）戰時合作最後一年</p>
<p>史迪威將軍於一九四四年被召回後在我們和中國戰時合作最後一年中的情形終於證明我們和蔣主席及其政府相處，是有合理和有效的方法的。</p>
<p>在魏德邁將軍繼史迪威擔任戰區司令之前，為史迪威辯護的人總說中國方面的情形，需要史迪威所慣用的「懇求，譴責和不客氣相待」的老辦法，但是這種辦法對於史迪威的繼任者，却並不認為必要，並且在我看來，它們之所以對史迪威成為必要，乃由於他的徧見所造成。</p>
<p>我認為在史迪成指揮之下的戰區司令部已往整個不幸的記錄，是可以使它成為中美關係上光榮的一章的。我尤其認為一九四四年中國東部的悲劇，以他當時可以動用的物資而論，是可以加以避免的。</p>
<p>當桂林和柳州的命運—因此也是中國東部的命運—已因日軍的攻勢而吿決定時，戰區司令部雖頗不願而終於允許以五百噸的供應品給予上述兩城的防衛者。這是在史迪威任內第一次也是最後一次給予中國地上部隊的直接援助，而在時間上又如此之遲，更足以說明他先前的缺點。</p>
<p>魏德邁的辦法完全證明這一點。在中美戰時合作剩餘的一段時間中，魏德邀在互敬的立塲上處理對中央政府的關係，結果使一九四二—四四年所造成的禍害，减輕了不少。</p>
<p>他把戰區司令部先前和中國領袖的仇視關係加以埋葬，此外，復在對日戰爭剩餘的一段時間中，把先前對中國共產黨公然的鼓勵，加以埋葬。但是我們對中共加以鼓勵的奇怪態度，後來又復活過來，直到一九四七年與一九四八年才逐漸死亡，</p>
<p>為了有些人或許要辯論，以為在中國東部失却之後魏德邁並沒有面臨和史迪成所面臨的類似問題之故，我們値得指出一點，就是日軍於一九四五年夏季向湖南省我方前進空軍根據地之一芷江所發動的攻勢，曾引起相似的困難。</p>
<p>當時實際從事作戰的中國地上部隊，都不是由美國人訓練或配備的，但是在日方攻勢展開之時，他們獲得了緊急援助。地上部隊對空中補給的依賴是很大的，但是這一次他們却獲得空中補給至最大限制。</p>
<p>總之，魏德邁決定　江必須予以據守。他獲得了中國領導方面的信心而非動搖他們的信心。他帮助地上部隊獲得活力，予以指導，而並不想獲得指揮權。</p>
<p>結果，日軍被擊破或被逐出，芷江得了救。雖然美國訓練和配備的在緬甸方面戰績卓著的新六軍曾空運到芷江來作為後備部隊，但是並未有參加作戰的需要。</p>
<p>可是我們對華這種新關係來得很遲，華盛頓對於中國多少已存有成見。不然，我確信我國戰後的對華政策是決不會主張中國共產黨加入南京政府的</p>
<p>我覺得馬歇爾國務卿戰後對中國問題的態度，大部份受史迪威報吿的影響。他在仲裁方面的努力，不自而然地落入中國共產黨和侵略性的國際共產主義的圈套。</p>
<p>當時我相信如此，以後的事態的發展也證明這一點。</p>
<p>史迪威和中國共產黨的「公開調情」，沒有比他離華九個月後所發生的一椿事情表現得更淸楚的了。</p>
<p>一九四五年七月，也就是日本最後崩潰的大約一個月之前，當時史迪威在冲繩島擔任美國第十軍司令，提出了一個直接獲助中國共產黨的計劃，後者會引起華盛頓相當的注意，結果把它向魏德邁轉達，請他表示意見。</p>
<p>當時我已經退休，不再擔任第十四航空隊的司令而在重慶休息，所以我得悉了這件事情。</p>
<p>槪括言之，史迪咸的建議乃是說第十軍部隊應在上海之北的江蘇省海岸登陸，以與中國共產黨軍隊獲得接觸，把美國的軍火和藥彈給予共產黨，讓他們向日軍佔據的上海進攻。</p>
<p>這個建議在重慶方面暗中引起了一種騒動，或許包括中央政府提出緊急抗議在內，結果它並沒有被實施。不甩說：在戰爭結束時由共產黨佔有上海，等於把中國的心臟區揚子江下游交給共產黨。</p>
<p>在我們過去對華十年的關係中，我們走過一段險峻的路程。困難還沒有過去，但是我相信我們已經跑過了十字路口，已作了準確的選擇。在獲得適當的指示之後，美國人是知道怎樣去找尋準確的路徑的。</p>
<p>但是我們的確已經蒙受了不可補償的損失，其中最重要的就是時間，歷史彷彿像嚴厲的敎師一樣，將會吿訴我們是否已經遷延過久了。（完）</p>

<h3>美海軍空運隊首次失事　運輸機墜江灣焚毀　起飛後右引擎發生障礙觸地起火　傷機師海軍人員十五名</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕美海軍空運隊C46型雙引擎運輸機一架，昨日中午十二時載美海軍人員連機師等共二十五人，自上海飛返靑島，在江灣機塲起飛後約十分鐘，右引擎發生障碍，該機乃立即向機塲折回將近跑道上空時，發生障碍之引擎已停止轉動，遂被迫降落於機塲西距離約半公里處之農田中。飛機觸地後，立即起火燃燒，機師與乘客在千鈞一髮中開啓機上保險門陸續跳出，其中除十五人受有輕重傷外，幸無死亡。</p>
<p>該機出事後，鄰近之我陸軍一〇一後方醫院睹狀，立即派人用擔架等將受傷者先予包扎急救。美海軍陸戰隊得訊後，立即派救護車前往出事地點，將傷者車送美海軍醫院治療，同時另派消防車前往撲滅機中火燄，因該處適有水溝，遂用永龍皮帶，經一小時許之灌救，烟火始完全熄滅。</p>

<h3>漁業爭執未解決　民營代表提責問　對漁管處行政認爲處置不當</h3>
<p>漁管處長招待記者　答復漁業所提各點</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕漁業善後物資管理處與民營漁業發生爭執，遷延已久，迄未解決，最近民營漁業方面更推派代表晋京向國大請願，並聞將依法對淮管處提出訴訟。據民營漁業代表表示，此次爭執發生之　結，因當初聯總與我政府訂有基本協定，一切捐贈物品，由我政府提出方案，由聯總會同我代表，依照方案採購運華，現任漁管處副處長王以康爲派往聯總漁業技術人員之一，所有聯總援華之漁業物資，即係依照我農林部之方案，由聯總專家麥參那氏與王所採購。</p>
<p>聯總無權干涉</p>
<p>至于該項物資分為兩種，作善後用者無代價配給人民，救濟用者酌量收費，惟所收費用應仍用於同一部門之善後事業，如造船木材屬於前者，而漁輸則爲善後兼有救濟性質。該項物質分配之　操諸行絕，聯　　　　　　　，　　　　　　　　後物資，更無權干涉屬於我政府之漁管處之行政。現聯總業告結束，且已無代表在滬，而漁管處輒稱一切秉承聯總之命行事，該處無權分配，實屬不當。</p>
<p>器具任令腐爛</p>
<p>且該處將漁業用品高價出售，貴重機器及漁具任令腐爛，漁輸以監理名義不予配給，更難卸其責任。去年浙省沈主席籌妥的款，要求承配木料自造漁船，前年農民銀行自動撥款三百億，要求造船，去年行總賬卹廳會自動撥麵粉一萬噸，擬爲漁民迭船，而該處竟將四萬餘噸木料，分運他埠，交分處保管，旣不自行造船，又不將木料交於地方政府。以上種種事實，均使民營漁業蒙受莫大影響，故毅然向漁管處提出公開　問。</p>
<p>另一方面，漁管處處長趙君邁，昨午五時，特假禮查大廈偕副處長下以康，主任秘書，及物資組長等招待記者，分別答覆民營漁業方面所提各點及記者詢問。</p>
<p>木料并無一根霉爛</p>
<p>（一）物資種類及處理情形：（甲）木料：共到二萬五千噸，值美金七十餘萬元，除用去及運往天津等處外，尚存二萬三千餘噸，並無一根霉爛。至於建造木船，主權確係移交我國，但當初因缺乏資金，曾擬向農民銀行備款，然聯總認爲不必，可由美棉款項搜付，及至請求搜歡，賺行總均告結東，發望抒。</p>
<p>漁輪主權尚屬聯總</p>
<p>（乙）棕繩：實際收到一萬五千　，一年來用去一千餘捲，存靑島擬配給民營漁業者一千餘捲，經調查後確有二千多捲霉爛，但并非漁管處之責，蓋此項棕繩，係美海軍剩餘物資，運滬前以堆置日久，即已發生霉爛，且大部係被美軍用　水腐蝕以防被敵利用。漁管處於接收後，因無倉庫存放，堆置空塲，但下面安放木板，上　雙層汕布，再加竹棚，現已將最好者挑出，在放附近商人倉庫內，至市面上有爛繩出現，恐係分發至各單位及漁輸後流出者，漁管處本身並未出售。（丙）機輸共一二六艘，　將六十艘出售（辦法將由保管委員會公布），十二艘作訓練駕駛員之用，十四艘在靑島，十艘在合灣，四艘在海南島，漁管處經常使用者，有二十五艘左右，但至今漁輸之主權尚在聯總手中。</p>
<p>影響民營　言之過甚</p>
<p>（二）根據漁市場統計，去年一年中，各方捕魚共得七十七萬担，其中民營帆船五十五萬担，機輸十五萬担，漁管處僅捕七萬担，故調該處影響民營，實言之過甚，且漁管處常將捕得之魚，運往外埠。至行政院前規定漁市塲應承銷漁管處之魚，每月至少五十萬斤非爲至多五十萬斤。（三）加工計劃：漁管處因農林部鹹魚產銷委員會尚未成立，故利用多餘之魚自製　魚，並未違法，且此項工作，實係虧本。</p>
<p>待遇問題</p>
<p>（四）待遇問題：外籍船員過去月薪九百美金，乃根據聯總與我國所計合約，同時每次並就捕漁所得，加給百分之四十，作爲津貼。自四月份起合約取消，上項百分之四十津貼，業已停止。中國船員三月份最多可得五千餘萬，最少約六百萬，獎金多至二千餘萬，少亦三百萬·最近已實行分潤制度，，不給薪水。</p>

<h3>市財政嚴重階段　薪金將達四千億</h3>
<p>財政局長田永　詐向記者稱：「本市市財政，因受物價及生活指數之影響，業已進入嚴重階段，上月份之市財政總收入約三千二百六十五億餘元，而支出總數爲三千二百八十餘億，故已感不足，內中市府各局員工之薪金額約佔一千三百億，若照最近透露之公敎人員待遇調聲，新指數爲二十四萬五千倍計，僅職工員警之薪金，即將達三千九百億元，此數已較本市每月之總收入超出六百餘億，其他之事業支出將更無着落，故地方財政前途，殊難樂觀」云。</p>

<h3>錫價再跌人心虛怯　食米賡續下挫　麵粉跌勢甚勁油市疲軟</h3>
<p>昨日米市，晨開以錫價再短，人心疲軟益甚，貨主視市無起色，相繼求脫，價遂再降十萬元。白粳南市塲三百六十五萬。北市三百七十五萬元，中途因價低，去路縛活，止疲轉昂，後市回起五萬元。結果絞上日降五萬至十萬元。秈米以客地價昂，到存均稀，市頗堅俏。蕪秈糙秈稍見上展，南市塲陰白元仍站原價，昨到貨共三千六百四十石。</p>
<p>麵粉</p>
<p>昨市跌勢加劇，聞美粉運到人心備極虛軟，執主競相脫手，客胃仍不動，價乃一瀉如注。兵船粉以一百三十九萬開盤，後降爲一百三十六萬五千元，老車粉等一致降六萬五千，麩皮欲昂反挫，終回低三萬，小麥廠盤减爲二百十萬小五萬元。</p>
<p>雜糧</p>
<p>堅秀，黃豆汕幫擇高貨而取，市得以支持立定。苞米市平，惟去路尚活。紅糧平定，菉豆南北二帮均有銷路，昂十萬元。芝蔴天津帮再來染指，續挺二十或三十萬。生仁回低十萬元，高貨尚定，揀靑平庸。</p>
<p>食油</p>
<p>徘徊疲途，生油銷路呆滯，交易零落。大有豆油最後八百十萬元，與昨相仿。豆餅客帮停吸，散戶頻吐，降四萬元。</p>
<p>又訊：招商局海宇輸，此次自仰光裝米八千七百噸，前日（十二）起程返滬，預計本月底可到滬。又其美輪，明日駛南洋，中紡有大批紗布運港暹，並有台糖三百五十噸，赴高雄裝載，運新加坡。</p>

<h3>人絲吸胃仍懈　廠經穩定綢貨續降</h3>
<p>昨人絲布况續跌，因本街及客幫納胃仍懈，實用廠吸力亦淡，因此欲振乏力。晨開一二〇號天橋爲二億三千萬開盤，嗣後業外人逢小有吸，始見回振，終以二億三千三百萬收市，再降二百萬。東洋及高山等亦續挫二百萬左右。</p>
<p>絲市趨於穩定，與昨市相埓，交易稀少，人心閒散。晨開CD兩級，仍喊三六五〇○萬元，午收成交開口貨五担，價三五五〇萬元。輯里干經，反見上升，午收做開特上十八分五担，運三一〇〇〇萬元。</p>
<p>綢市昨續降，晨開大誠被面做一四〇二〇萬元，逢低有吸，一度升至一四一五〇萬元，終因股市不振，臨收又軟，即期爲一四一〇〇元，軋低二四〇萬元。豐縐隨跌一萬元，交易頗活，餘多站穩。</p>
<h3>客幫納胃薄弱　紗市普遍回軟　棉布籌碼充裕價亦挫削</h3>
<p>昨紗市勢呈盤局，緣客帮納胃依然不振，本街亦抱觀望，以致交易淸稀。四二支藍鳳初開承上日收盤行情徘徊，後傳聞當局有查紗號賬冊之說，人心一度回軟，中曾做二億二千八百萬。惟複製業見低有進，臨收稍見軋升，終以二億三千三百萬收盤，續升三百萬，四二支賓光水月均回堅二百萬，二一支雙馬自一億四千五百萬開盤，後雖有檯面幫哄抬，曾見二億四千七百萬，奈以空方壓力較重，終告回落，以開盤行情收市，回降五百萬。四二支各檔去化不一，榮辱互見。六一支各檔趨呆，普見回跌二百萬至三百五十萬不等。</p>
<p>昨棉布市况，天津客帮有吐售，染廠納胃呆鈍，散戶進出雖繁，純屬高出低進，更因本街號商轉入淡銷季節，吸胃更稀。紡建疊配，額子充裕，致十二磅龍頭細布晨開四八四萬，逐步下降，達四七六萬元。嗣由散戶逢低有納，回升至四七八萬元收市。</p>
<p>紡建公司昨供喇叭童細布四四八萬元，四君子元嗶嘰四五三萬，及四君子元府糾五三五萬元，聲請者寥家無幾。</p>
<h3>申請配棉簡則　經部準予備案</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕紗管會擬訂之紗廠緊急申請配棉簡則，換紗換布合約，經呈經濟部後，昨已奉部令准予備案。又該會制定之「未經指定代紡紗廠採購棉花須知」，亦經經濟部准予轉呈行政院備案</p>

<h3>外銷茶交易稀</h3>
<p>昨日茶市，執主感於存底依然寥若晨星，而又以今後茶工恐仍將　增，因此對握在手中之貨，售意咸不稍鬆。但內銷茶，本街與客帮始終嫌價奇昂，態度消極。他若外銷花色，出口商亦在整理連日辦就之貨，俾資急速付裝北菲，是以買勢均告不力，過程進出兩稀，交易難轉活潑。然潛勢靜中仍堅，脚地毫無下墜之象</p>
<p>又訊：茲據茶業界對記者談稱：目前漸屆茶汎，浙贛皖等產區之毛茶，均趨發育之期，大致不久即將相繼生產。惟今年因天時不正，氣候未見溫和，抑且又受百物飛漲之影響，故茶身旣不若去歲鮮嫩，而價格則恐有一鳴驚人之慨。綜觀此種情形，實銷能否順利，尚在未卜之天。</p>
<h3>紡織工廠遷港粵　花管會表示并無所聞</h3>
<p>中經社記者頃就花紗布管理工作，目前爲各方所矚目之重要問題數則，訪詢花紗布管理委員會負責人，據談如下：問，在貴會代紡代織試辦期中，以棉換紗廠家，已有幾家，答，申請以棉換紗者有大豐等卅六家，已訂約者有兆豐等七家，囑其來會訂約者，有永民等八家，正在辦理中者，有大同等二家，尚在調查中者，有新裕等十九家。問，截至目前爲止，貴會委託中紡農行等機構已購原棉若干，到達上海庫存若千，掌握數字大約幾何。答，（一）中紡代購二十餘萬祖，（二）中農代購八萬餘祖，（三）棉聯代購一萬六七千拒，（四）自購二萬餘祖，（五）外銷委員會印棉移轉本會者一萬四千担，到達上海倉庫者共約十六萬担。問，關於紡織工廠遷港一事，甚爲各方注意，貴會方面所持態度如何。答，紡織工廠遷港一事，幷無所聞。惟所知者，若干工廠向外國所定購之紗綻運抵香港後，不即運來上海，則爲事實。或有就地建廠之說，但未必可能。其理由爲：（一）香港氣候不宜紡紗，（二）香港地價奇高，建廠談何容易。</p>
<p>〔又訊〕據工業界權威聲稱，華南經濟穩定，地區安寗，採辦原料較易，管制機構亦少，生產效率當可比滬增加數倍。茲悉本市申新廠，昨已有紡織機七百噸，運往廣州裝置。擬在該地設立新廠，藉圖發展。又悉本市數家新興工廠，前向美國所定機器，本定運至本市裝置，現聞該項機器亦已直接運往廣州裝卸。</p>

<h3>世風與人心</h3>
<p>— 呉庸</p>
<p>外界的環境發生動盪，內在的人性自然也會因之發生變化。人性在戰亂時期，猶如一瓶積有沈　物的液體，經劇烈搖動後，本來居於底層的不潔之物，此時都升浮到上面來，人性正是如此，被戰亂所激動，其最惡劣的一部份，原來是潛在的，靜止的，如今都發洩出來了。人性好比一瓶乾凈的氣化鈣，戰亂好比是生澱劑的硫酸，把這生澱劑加在氣化鈣里，便促成了搶刧，强姦，囤積，投機，殺人，放火等等，人性中不潔的沈澱物。人性經這樣的激變後，人類的文明便暫時的被向後移退了數千百年；在戰亂時期，多數人們所信奉的是榛荒時代的法律：人人為己，氣力較大的人說的話便是正義。甚至和平到來的時候，秩序一時也難恢復，浮動於上面的渣滓，過了好久，還不容易沈澱到底面去。</p>
<p>在戰亂時期，人性之惡化，世風之可慮，自然是事實。於是有些人目擊心傷，認為局勢愈來愈糟，乃興「一代不如一代」之感；甚至還有許多人發思古之幽情，無時不懷念着「好的舊日子」，頗有些憶舊復古，歸眞返樸的意思。這一類人的口頭禪是二句話，呌做「世風日下」，「人心不古」。這些話如果是表示說者對於現狀的不滿，表示對於環境沒有改進而起的焦急，那非但是人情之常，無可厚非，而且是一種心理健全的表現，社會改進的先聲，我們應該予以同情。</p>
<p>可是筆者深信社會的演變是漸進的；演化雖然和緩，却無時不在向前推進着，則是無可置疑。到了某一時期，我們也許會覺得社會的演化入於停滯狀態，或者甚且發生暫時開倒車的現象，可是至最壞的程度，也不過是與往昔同樣的糟；即以往昔戰亂時期的情形來說，我們但須查查歷史，便可知道往昔未始沒有殘酷混亂的事例。是故「世風日下」一語，核以歷史的事實，乃是並不恰當的。</p>
<p>歷代的人們總以為古時是如何的好，當前的局面是如何如何的惡劣。實則此乃由於一種心理上的錯覺，因為在一般人的目中，凡是現實的近旁的東西總是不免有缺陷的，對於得不到看不見的東西，却往往把牠想像得好過於事實。比方歷代的人們對於堯舜總是稱頌不止，對於桀紂總是加以誹議，孔子却說：「紂之不善，不若是之甚也。」那麽反過來我們可以推知堯舜之德也未必如所稱頌的那麼聖明。</p>
<p>「世風日下」這句話的心理背眾只是「崇古卑今」四個字。須知今日的環境，固然有許多事未盡如理想，可是也不見得整個的現世是十八層的地獄，正如古代未必是高入雲霄的天堂一樣。王充說得好：「上世之士，今世之士也，俱含仁義之性，則其遭事並有奮身之節，古有無義之人，今有建節之士，善惡雜厠，何世無有？述事者好高古而下今，貴所聞而賤所見，辯士則談其久者，文人則著其遠者。近有奇而辯不稱，今有異而筆不記。」</p>
<p>國人似乎特別的好古，例如保存國粹，玩賞古董，又如畫家之好畫古裝人物，凡此種種，都是好古之表現·這種好古太甚的積習也許即是阻碍進步的原因之一。綜上所述，我的結論是：世風並未日下，人心理應不古。</p>
<h3>杭州歸來談吃麵</h3>
<p>— 陳詒先</p>
<p>今年杭州春游之盛，人所米見。報載奎元館麵店一天所用鱔魚，至一石之多，奎元館是以蝦爆鱔出名者，黃鱔以春末夏初為最肥美，現正當令。兒童節前一日，余與妻携外孫女游杭，小住三日，未到奎元館，但仍吃麵兩次。一次為聚水館，在保佑坊，其蝦爆鱔買儿萬六一碗，與奎元館同價，麵輕易寬，生料油下鍋，澆頭豐富，據友人言其口味在奎元之上，係近年新開者。一次為聚勝館，在豐橋樂，余在七七以前居杭二十年，常與二三友人到此店吃麵，乃杭州最老麵店，去年為其一百年紀念，店主翁姓，此次往吃，要半湯兒麵，與店夥略提往事，麵來果然不錯，蓋店主人聽為十年前老主顧，特別巴結也。上海人游杭州，但知有奎元館，不知有新開之聚水，百年之聚勝，特寫此篇，以告以後之游人。</p>
<p>原子筆用不得</p>
<p>在重慶，剛勝利的時候，幾家拍賣行裏已經陳列着幾枝原子筆，標價相當貴，要買念五萬元一枝，合當時一兩黃金的價錢。大家只有存着好奇心對它看看，究竟怎麼會加了一次墨水可以源源不絕地用上幾年，則是莫名其妙。</p>
<p>後來復員歸來，特地到故鄉——上海去探望幾個闊別九年的親戚，順便帶了一點成都的銀器，重慶的黨參去送給他們，他們就送了我一枝翡翠色的原子筆，當時的價値約四五萬元一枝，我嫌它太貴，終因盛情難却，只得收下。於是我開始研究它的構造，原來它的筆尖上有着一顆小於筆管千分之一的鋼珠，寫的時候，鋼珠與紙面磨擦，因之而轉動，筆管裘的墨汁就附着鋼珠的表面而印在紙上，於是寫出字來。當時如果你手裏有一枝原子筆，頓覺身價十倍，大家都要刮目相看。可是用了不久，時常寫不出字來。說明書上叫你用口在筆尾上的一個小孔裏吹一下，就可有墨水出來，無非想藉空氣的壓力使墨汁往下擠，但結果有時有效，有時無效。寫不出的緣故，也許是紙張的關係，在普通的紙上寫字，紙上的細毛會順着鋼珠的轉動而嵌入管內，因之阻礙鋼珠的活動，而不能寫出字來。到後來，筆裏的墨汁非但不從筆頭上出來，而往筆尾上的小孔裏擠出來，即使把小孔塞住了也沒有用，弄得衣袋口上都是墨潰。有一次，大的熱漲冷縮的緣故，鋼珠隨同墨汁一齊流了出來，弄得一塌糊塗，好容易在墨汁裏找了半天，方始把鋼珠找到，把它塞進筆頭管要，從此我就把它擱置不用，免得再找麻煩。</p>
<p>我的幾個有原子筆的朋友，不是寫不出，便是鋼珠流出。我那個送筆給我的親戚，他的一枝筆也因鋼珠流出，弄得一件新長衫上完全是墨潰，手上也沾了一手的墨水，洗都　不掉。這簡直不是原子筆，而是　禍筆了。我想用過　　原子筆的人，起初都存着好奇心與它親　一下，結果無不把它拋棄一旁，恨如切骨，因為化了金錢不算，非但不切實用，而且還要受累。這批筆在我國人手裏的數量，諒不會少，騙去我們的金錢，實在可觀。上海人說：滑頭生意，只要每個人上它一次當，他就可發財。我個人的吃虧事小，但願以後大家再也不要上雷諾的當！</p>
<h3>集郵</h3>
<p>— 弘賢</p>
<p>多少朋友們都喜歡集郵，而且多以外國的稀奇郵票當作珍物，其實說來，中國的郵票乃是世界上最珍貴的郵票，其所能珍貴的原因共有三端，姑列之以作集郵家的參考。第一：中國郵票的本身價格可驚，從半分一分起到一百元為止，這恐怕乃是世界各國郵票的票面價値，可是我們中國却有了一千至一萬以至十萬，恐怕也有百萬的郵票，這些天文數字的票價可為珍貴特點之一。</p>
<p>第二：中國郵票的種類繁多，幾乎一年要出幾次新花採，而且有限某某地使用的郵票及改作若干元的郵票，其相差之大也可列為奇珍。</p>
<p>第三：中國郵票所用的紙張和印色也往往會有糢糊的缺陷，這種缺陷，也往往為集郵家為賞識，試看同樣版式的郵票其色澤往往相差甚大，可供好奇者之考證。</p>
<p>記得世界上有以郵票為財政收入的國家，中國如能以複雜新奇之大額郵票兜售於世界郵票市塲之中，亦必可獲利，目前尙未做到，眞是一件憾事。</p>
<h3>非樂？</h3>
<p>— 酉廷</p>
<p>墨子非樂簾：「民有三患，飢者不得食，寒者不得衣，勞者不得息；……為樂非也。」</p>
<p>墨翟這個邏輯，四個字就可駁倒：「因噎廢食」；但看看今年國定音樂節（四月五日）的寂然以去，連一個唱片音樂會都沒有，則可見創定這個節日的文化當局，也許正熟讀了墨子的這句話，而雅不願在戰亂中給人民以音樂。</p>
<p>然而事有令人不堪忍受者：在上海，高樓大厦中一片歌舞昇平氣象，到處是「音樂」，扭開收音機的開關，便有連續不斷的歌聲：「郞呀郞呀，我的寃家！」—那些技術最拙劣，內容最淫蕩的「音樂」</p>
<p>「支那之夜」與「滿洲姑娘」的歌聲停止後，充塞於市民耳鼓的，仍然以低級　情的聲普為主；在這樣情形下，連一個音樂節日都吝於點綴，夫復何言？不背倡導，不肯敎育人民，老百姓的水變安得不低。</p>
<p>倒是友邦為我們發急了，美國新聞處最近除了每兩週例行的唱片音樂欣賞會外，又每週舉行特別演唱會（兩者均免費入塲），為這偌大的上海做些社會音樂敎育的工作，雖然這效果也有限，至少一般學生，公務員，職業青年，可以受惠。</p>
<p>最近，又有永和實業公司每週末假大美合衆兩電台舉行的交響樂及其他古典樂的播送，為大家介紹現代音樂的輪廓，提高一般欣賞的水準；這即使是廣吿性質，其意義與效果，値得感謝！而且，站在商業廣吿的立塲，而能附帶為東方一大都市的上海播種些藝術的種子，使這烏烟瘴氣的大空間，仍保全些潔白的部份，使芸芸衆生也有片刻的陶冶與安息；此實業公司的這一創舉，我們希望有人效法。</p>
<p>同時，我們不相信，有領導之責的文化當局眞以為目前不必談音樂，至少為下一代想，不宜如此！</p>
<h3>櫻花樹下</h3>
<p>— 賀天健</p>
<p>參加賞櫻會，坐櫻花樹下，不禁棖觸萬端，賦兩律以示國人。倘蒙海內同文賜和，請寄本市復興路一二八三號本人收。</p>
<p>不關異土也開花，今日東風共一家，放眼要同天地闊，存心那可物吾差！春來園裏千層雪，風動枝頭萬片霞，坐久何知人散盡，抬頭忽叫半聲鴉。</p>
<p>兵戈動地此猶閒，人帶歡心半日看，花比西施應怯越，（願國人於此句應注意）時懷東晋且期安（人名字）；徘徊幾輩憐春急，抖擻幽情笑我殫，一月前頭梅樹下，廻腸九折九回酸！</p>
<h3>柯立芝軼事</h3>
<p>— 冷冷</p>
<p>美國總統柯立芝手下有一個女書記。因為時常把標點弄錯，柯民想設法糾正她的過失，可是並不　直地責備她；他先用贊賞的口吻對她說：</p>
<p>「我看你的容貌服色都很美麗，做事又能幹，眞是一位十全十美的姑娘。」</p>
<p>女書記受寵若驚，臉上嬌羞可掬，心山異常欣喜。</p>
<p>柯氏接着笑道：</p>
<p>「你別害羞，漂亮而又能幹的姑娘値得被人稱贊。」</p>
<p>他一面走過去，立在女書記的打字桌旁。</p>
<p>「哦！你在打昨天我招待記者的談話記錄嗎？道是一篇有關……」他故意挨近身去注視打字機。</p>
<p>「怎麼？打字機鍵盤的鉛字有毛病嗎？你看標點符號總是不對，讓我試試看。」</p>
<p>安書記急忙起身讓坐，柯氏坐下愼重地試打一下，就立起對她說：</p>
<p>「沒有什麼毛病，不過打標點符號時稍為注意一下就行，你自己再試一下。」</p>
<p>女書記早已明瞭柯氏的用意，內慚於心；以後打字非但沒有弄錯標點符號，並且打得異常正確敏捷。這當然要歸功於柯氏的輕描淡寫，使她自覺錯誤而改進。</p>
<h3>語文舉訛</h3>
<p>— 孑弦</p>
<p>文質彬彬論語雍也：「質勝文則野，文勝質則史；文質彬彬，然後君子。」包注：「彬彬，文質相半之貌。」按「文」為表現於外，「質」為充實於內，均喩人之品德。今喩人之斯文有禮曰「文質彬彬，」甚且形容舉止為「彬彬然，」或「彬彬有禮」者，殊覺不妥。</p>
<p>取笑俗謂向人調笑曰「取笑」，殊不知「取笑」者，取人之譏笑也。五代史書家人傳：「文章非素習，必不能工，傳之於口，徒取笑也。」今人取義，適得其反。</p>
<p>一倡三嘆禮樂記：「壹倡三嘆，有遺音者矣。」注：「倡，發歌句也；三嘆，三人從嘆之耳。」意謂一人唱而三人和也。今以「一唱三嘆」喻文字之情意纏綿深刻感人，亦與原義不符。</p>
<p>執事服務於人以供使令者為執事。國語越語，越大夫文種使吳代勾踐致辭：「…不敢徹聲聞於大王，私於下執事曰…」左傳：「使下臣犒執事」，前則示勾踐不敢與吳王抗禮，故稱「執事」，後則明指供使令之人。今人書翰中常以「執事」稱對方，實大不敬。或謂所以稱「執事」者，不敢直指其人謙詞也，然亦頗牽强。</p>
<p>委瑣史記司馬相如傳：「且夫賢君之踐位也，豈特委瑣握　，拘文牽俗，循誦習傳，當世取說云爾哉？」（難蜀父老）索隱：「委瑣，細碎也。」近世常以「委瑣」喩人之容止鄙俗，實有未常。</p>
<p>官司本作百官解。左傳：「備物典策，官司彝器；」又「皂隸之事，官司之守，非君所及也。」今稱訴訟之事曰官司，進行訴訟曰「打官司」或「吃官司，」實不可解。或謂「官司，」官司之事也，惟官之所司，固不僅訟一事，則此說亦　　　。</p>

<h3>逍遙花</h3>
<p>— 陳慎言</p>
<p>第十四章逍遙海上　一二五</p>
<p>寫完之後，又重復看了一遍，心想不知綺紈看了這封信，作何感想？她對我極鍾情，定有同感，我也不希望能和她舊歡重拾，只要她能明瞭我的心，知道我的苦惱，彼此魚雁常通，我的心靈上，就得了安慰了。渚齋寫完這一封信，又細想一回，才脫衣安歇，心上似完了一宗大事，心神也安靜了許多。第二日天色剛亮，便醒起來，一想打今天起，要重新改變生活，不能再這樣糊裏糊塗，混了過去，從前努力學戲，都是天一亮就起來，現在每日除到銀行辦公外，把精神仍寄託在京劇上，父親曾說過，公餘有個娛樂，可以調劑精神，現且試一時，也許能把我一腔的煩惱，漸漸洗刷乾凈。渚齋想着，便披衣起來，草草洗渦臉，呷一口熱水，便忽忽出去，這時天色剛剛黎明，馬路上空氣淸潔，渚齋在馬路上慢慢走着，心裏暗忖最近幾月來，為綺紈顚倒，神志不定，每天晚睡，早晨遲起，像這樣早晨淸潔空氣，好幾個月，沒有領略，若不是受過巨烈打擊之後今天還不會出來散步。又相當日遇見綺紈，就為的早上出來吊嗓，才結下意外奇緣，不想曇花一現，轉眼成空，遺留下滌洗不掉煩惱，這種精神上的損失，是無可抵償的，可見一個人不要妄想，一切都要安分守己，才可免除許多是非。一面想着，一面走着，不知不覺，已到中山公園後門，一時又想起，當日邂逅綺紈就在這園內，今日都成陳跡，我且進去看看。想着，走進園門，度過柴橋，園後一彎池水，仍是靜悄悄地，池面微風過處，起了一片縐紋，這時已是暮春二月，在北國才有春意，沿水一帶柳樹，柳絲上已現微綠，倒影在水上，水紋微漾，柳絲縈拂，煞是好看。</p>
<h3>談詩及韻</h3>
<p>— 清雷學園</p>
<p>本報三月三十日地方通訊版載潘公展先生在杭題畫詩，即景隨筆，與同版薩老鎭冰謝衆寳詩之留紀念必須娜重其事者，原不相同。潘公見夫人作畫，興之所至，題詩一首，故以畫喩薩為工筆，潘為寫意。潘詩亦是七絕，末句「今朝大地又春回」亦寓刦後復興之意，故乃生氣盎然。而兩詩之大不同處，在於用韻。</p>
<p>薩詩是按詩韻（七陽），潘詩則不拘一韻（菲字微字屬五微，回字屬十灰），這可以分「原則」，與「前例」兩層硏究。（一）原則上「韻」貴乎「叶」，不「叶」即無所謂「韻，」此理易明·至於所謂通行詩韻，行之千餘年，當製定時本無詳細調查，而古人與時人，甲地與乙地之音，又至為複雜。故因韻之字有不叶，而相叶之字又未必一韻。而歷代相沿，尤其應制詩，館閣體盛行，以此為桎　思想自由之其，故從無時代的修正。文人因別無可資實用之標準，又不宜各隨各便，泛濫無歸，只可將就，此詩韻乃因循不廢。（二）前人於此善於遝用者，一為選韻，或選擇較寬之韻而用之。（如薩老所用屬「七陽」即寬韻之一，字多而不雜，即便撰作長篇，亦不處支絀，）或就一韻中選其相叶者而用之·（如王漁洋秋柳第一首之韻脚「魂」「門」「痕」「村」「論」皆相叶，十分協調，皆在十三元韻目之内，但十三院內之繁園原　等字則絕對拋開。）好在是寬韻，即不出韻，亦自游刃有餘。）再者跨韻，則不拘拘於詩韻原目的限制。如張探花（謚文襄名之洞）過蕪湖弔袁使君詩（袁昶字爽秋，曾任蕪湖道，庚子以太常卿主勦拳被害）云：「七國聯軍竟叩關，知君郤敵補靑天。千秋人痛晁家令，曾為君王策萬全。」首句韻脚屬「十五删」，後兩韻則屬「一先」，即不拘韻目之限。因是自己的作品，故有此自由。潘公之游西湖題唐畫詩，亦跨兩個韻目，亦是自己的作品，故不受拘束。假如張探花應科舉時及翰林任內各項考試之作，亦如此串跨，不但不能入翰林，只恐與高心虁之「平生雙四等，該死十三元」同一失運，甚矣「詩韻」一書之誤人也。（高心　於淸同洽時曾任蘇州苜縣，其不得翰林，屈為縣令，即因詩出韻被列入四等，故事見薛福成著庸菴筆記）</p>
<p>近年做詩之風極盛，張羣院長，翁文灝博士，張學良將軍，馮玉祥將軍的高吟，都在報上見過。周作人，江亢虎，等等之作，更數見不鮮，（偽不偽亦各言其詩也，故亦不妨一提）。並且英國作家紀爾葛特氏亦在極力宣傳中國的詩（見二月二十四·申報），際此烽火氣氛遍，於環球之世界，而國詩之閒情雅韻，與之俱行，何殊火內靑蓮，孽海裏的寳筏，所以還要中外古今詳徵博考，仔細談之。</p>

<p>電信特刊</p>
<p>郁東堅題　第十期　上海電信局業務處主編</p>
<h3>中國電信學會　成立大會記述</h3>
<p>— 越凡</p>
<p>欲使中國成為現代進步之國家，發展交通與促進工業為目前最主要之工作，因此具有推動與改進能力之各種學術性學會，實為不可缺少之組織。我國電信創辦迄今，已有七十餘年之歷史，全國電信從業人員，祗就交通部方面言，已達四萬餘人。祗以吾國科學落後，工業不發達，各項電信設施，尙不能追隨其他先進國家並進。現代電信技術，日新月異，今後欲建設新中國之電信，必須急起直追。因此，在去年十二月二十八日首屆電信紀念日，由全國電信同人及電信專家發起組織中國電信學會，經數月之積極籌備，已於本月十一日正式穴吿成立，茲將該日成立大會開會情形，記述於後：</p>
<p>會塲設於育嬰堂路電信人員上海訓練所三樓，到有各地電這局代表會員及社會部指導員王家樹，曁來賓前中國工程師學會會長趙祖康，中國電機工程師學會會長趙曾珏，中國電機工程師上海分會會長莊智煥等二百三十餘人。九時正，大會開始，行禮如儀後，先由該會籌備委員郁秉堅盧宗澄等報吿籌組該會之意義及經過，並感謝電信同志之合作與來賓之惠臨指導，同時更希望國內有志電信人士，參加合作硏究。繼由社會部指導員及來賓趙祖康趙曾珏莊智煥等分別演講，語多肯要。最後為修改章程草案及討論會務，公推郁秉堅為臨時主席，並經全體會員熱烈討論後議決各要案如下：（一）今年主要修正之點為第六條：「凡具有在國內外大學畢業後二年以上，專科畢業後五年以上之電信服務經驗，或技術，報務，話務，會計，業務等電務人員，從事電信事業在十年以上，而成績優良者，由會員二人之介紹，並經理事會審查通渦得為正會員。大學或專科畢業，從事電信事業或技術，報務，話務，會計，業務等電務人員，從事電信事業在三年以上而成績優良或有相當資格者，由會員兩人之介紹，經理事會審查通過，得為仲會員。」第十五條增設「候補理事七人，候補監事三人」外，餘均通過。（二）司選委員人選，除各地代表為當然委員外，因本屆選舉事務較繁，加推十一人為司選委員。（三）理監事候選人，以每千人推舉十人為原則。（四）首屆理監事，規定於五月二十八日以前產生。（五）第一屆年會，預定本年電信紀念日在首都舉行。（六）刊印年鑑。（七）徵求各地電信同志，熱烈參加，並早日成立分會。大會至正午十二時完畢，頗形熱烈云。</p>
<h3>從經濟眼光看——　記賬電報</h3>
<p>— 君仲</p>
<p>勝利後物價不斷地上漲，市塲的彼和動電信局來去報的多寡，息息相關，己成比率的對照。尤其是上海，五洋雜處，商務頻繁，市塲的蠢動，能影響到全國經濟的變遷。因此，作為全國神經總樞的上海電信局，每天都擠滿了拍報人，往往要守候許久才能輪着，其實這短短時間中特快電報早就送到對方了。拍發者因為等候得焦慮，認為我們電信局辦事不力，徒然費了時浪間。</p>
<p>收報最繁忙的時間，常在上午十一時左右到下午四五時。短短的五六小時內，要收受電報一萬份之多。而每張電報都需經過計費，收費，繕寫收執等三種手續，營業員手不停點，緊張地工作，還是來不及清理。</p>
<p>為了　補上述的缺點，增加電報傳遞的速率，便產生了記賬電報。普通拍電報是用現款交易的，機關或商行一天內拍發電報較多的，付款和收款，將不勝其煩，何况浪費寳貴的光陰，影　到電報的迅速。所以採用記賬電報辦法之後，將麻煩的支付手誠，改為一次回　式的簽收，換句話說，便節省了三分之二强的守候時間。</p>
<p>至於記賬電報的登記手續，非常簡單，只要向電信局營業科塡具申請書，由營業科估計用戶每月內來去報的多少，酌收相當的保證金。目前最低的金額是五百萬元，以每天拍發一次十萬元，所以估計並不溢收。但是記賬電報到現在為止，還不能被用戶普遍地利用，最大的原因，歸結於一般用戶對記賬電報的性質，缺乏認識，用戶的心理以為一次付出一筆很可觀的保證金，這筆呆賬的利息便無形中損失。在高利貸的今天，誰不想活用他的資金。不過這種情形，粗看起來似乎很合理，實際上不　然，讓筆者舉個實例來說，月初你開了記賬戶，付了五百萬保證金，你就每天絡續拍發，第一次拍報前的利息以五百萬計算，日息最多不過五六萬，第二次應當减去己發的報費，日息便更少了。月終保證金的數目和所拍的報費，差不多己互相抵消。可是你還可以繼續使用，直到規定的期限，付去上月份的虧欠報費。這樣用戶的損失極微，却因善於利用記賬電報，而換得利息上的便宜。</p>
<p>我們希望用戶能瞭解我們的實際情形，充份利用記賬電報，以有助於發電的迅速與準確。</p>

<h3>電話發明小史</h3>
<p>— 王大椿</p>
<p>吾們都知道發明電話的，是亞歷山大格拉亨貝爾（Alexander　Graham　Bell）殊不知在他發明電話器的時候，還有一位伊立夏格萊（Elisna　Gray）也發明了一具電話器，他們兩人，同在一八七六年二月十四日，把本人發明的機械，送到美國聯邦專利局，請求註册，時間上，貝爾僅早於格萊二小時，雖然這兩具電話，經試驗後，員爾的比較靈活，就被採用，歷經改良，沿用至今，但是，以兩個不相識的人，在同時同地，硏究同樣問題，發明同樣機械，公諸於世，這不能不說是發明史上的奇蹟了。</p>
<p>格萊生於美國俄亥俄省（Ohio）的巴奈斯維爾城（Barnesville），一生致力於研究電學，終於發明了一具電話器，不幸成績沒有貝爾同時發明的優良，致一番苦心湮沒無聞。貝爾原生於蘇格蘭首邑愛丁堡一八七〇年，隨其父往加拿大，二年後，再遷居美國波士頓城，就在波士頓大學執敎　，他從小就喜歡硏究電學，起始就想藉電力傳輸音浪至遠方，經數年之試驗，於一八七六年，製成了第一具電話器，此為發明電話的嚆矢。貝爾的父親。原為一個慈祥人物，嘗敎授一般可憐的聾啞兒童，年輕的貝爾，受其薰陶，在加拿大也敎過不少啞童，不獨敎他們用信號，代替講話，更利用他試騐的電話器，用各種不同的聲浪信號，將語意傳至遠方。</p>
<p>此外還有一位電學發明家，吾們不能把他忘記，這就是衆所共知的愛迪生（Thomas　Edison）。此君於發明電燈電氣鐵路等之外，對於電報電話的改進，實有絕大的功績，幼年的愛迪生，不過是美國俄亥俄省米蘭（Milan）火車站上的賣報小僮，但是志趣很大，當把積蓄的金錢，買了一架小印刷機和鉛字，就在火車上旅行的時候，刋印他的小型報紙發售，旅客們為好奇心所動，很踴躍的購買他的報紙，愛迪生因此積蓄了更多的金錢，購買各種書籍和科學儀器，因為時常進出火軍站，所以和鐵路人員很熟，借行李車作為試騐室，不幸的有一次，撥翻了一些酸液，火車內立刻起火，雖是救熄了，但是，行李車的管理員，就把他驅逐出站，那時他的科學試騐，幾乎不能繼續，後來有一次，他在車站上看見一個小孩，立在鐵路軌上，適有一輛火車駛來，愛迪生奮不顧身，跳到軌道上，把那小孩救出，這是站長的兒子，當然感激愛迪生救子之恩，就把他請去，當車站的電報生，從此得到硏究電報和電話的機會，發明了四工電報（Quadrupler　Telegraph　System），在一根電報綫上，同時可送四個電報，在電話方面，他發明一種炭屑傳話器（Carbon　Granual　Transmitter），即吾們電話機裏所應用的。此外，經他改良而現在實用的電話機械亦很多，他眞是一個電話發明史中的大功臣呢。</p>
<h3>電信常識講話（十）</h3>
<p>— 張家鈺</p>
<p>第四講　怎樣書寫收報人名址</p>
<p>自從郵局把航空信件的起重單位從每十公分改為二十公分之後，聽說各文其店裏的航空信封的銷路，就大大地打了一個折扣，原因是很明顯的：在航空信件的起重單位沒有改動以前，凡重量在十公分以上不滿二十公分的航空信件，就得加倍貼付航空郵資，我們寄信的目的無非希望把信箋上面所寫的話傳給收信人，誰願意為了揀用一個紙質較厚（份量較軍）的信封而多付出一筆額外的郵資呢？</p>
<p>如果把同樣的心理應用到根據字數計費的電報上去，我們拍發電報的目的，無非想把電文傳給收報人，誰願意為了冗長的收報人姓名住址而增重報費的負担？可是，在你沒有瞭解怎樣節省收報人名址裏的字數的各種訣竅之前，那就非得把名址寫得詳詳細細，就會講電報投送鍇誤或竟然投送不到。不信？請看下面所舉的例子：</p>
<p>「上海　中山北一路（786）弄（84）號李子星　款速匯　王」</p>
<p>上面是一張電報的全文，總共計有十七個字（按收報地名「上海」祗作一字），其中包括收報地名和收報人姓名住址十三個字，電文三個字和發報人署名一個字，除發報人署名是否需要，可以聽由發報人自己決定外，發報人化在他實際上所想說的話—電文—上的費用，差不多祗及全部報費的六分之一，但化費在收報人名址上的費用，却佔去全部報費的六分之五弱，它的不經濟是可想而知的。但是，如果為了企圖節省字數而把寫在名址裏的隨便那一個字减掉，那又可能引起投送錯誤或竞至投送不到，結果反而誤事。</p>
<p>這一講裏，筆者準備把書寫收報人姓名住址的各種省字省費的方法，逐一介紹給讀者。不用說得，講到節省收報人名址的字數的最最經濟和有效的方法，自然要讓為</p>
<p>電報掛號了，這裏所說的「掛號」，它的性質和郵局裏的掛號信或者醫生診病的掛號等類完全不同，讓我們試舉一個例子來說明電報掛號的用途，譬如說：上海有一家公裕洋行，他的地址是上海中正東路七號門牌，當他還沒有向電局掛號以前，所有各方發給他的電報，須得把收報人名址詳細寫明如「上海中正東路七號公裕洋行」，作為十一個字計費，（按收報地名「上海」祗作一字，如果他先到當地電局去掛上一個電報掛號，也就是認定一個字—假定用0361（公）字—作為他的名址的代號之後，所有各方發給他的電報，祗要把收報人名址和收報地名寫做「0361上海」，作為二個字計費。換句話說：在他認定電報掛號之後，各方發給他的每一份電報，就可省去九個字的報費。</p>
<p>電報掛號分做華文和洋文兩種，洋文掛號以不超過十個字母為限，華文掛號規定為四個數碼，但在上海，由於四碼掛號不敷供應，最近又新添一種六碼華文掛號。電報掛號的有效期分做長期和短期兩種，長期為一年，短期三個月，取費非常低廉，掛號戶每月所付的掛號　，祗相等於尋常華文電報十個字的報費。洋文掛號和華文掛號在華文或洋文電報裏都可以通用，國外發來的電報，也可用洋文掛號代替收報人姓名住址。</p>
<p>發交掛號戶收轉的電報，華文祗要在收報地名之後加上轉某人字樣，例如「0361上海轉王志仁」，洋文祗要把收報人姓名寫在電報掛號前面，中間加上c／o（收轉）一字，例如Wangchihjen　c／oJointmercShanghai（假定Jointmerc是某戶的洋文電報掛號），但是為了避免收轉延誤起見，還是自己直接到電局裏去認掛一個電報掛號來得妥當，其次是</p>
<p>電話號數代替收報人住址　發給在收報局當地裝有電話的收報人的電報，也可用收報人住所所裝的電話號數代替收報人的住址，但必須寫明收報人的姓名，並在電話號數前面加一「話」字例如（華文電報）或「話（11130）上海張家鈺」「Changchiayu　Telephone11130　Sbanghai」（洋文電報），電局在收到這張電報之後，先從電話簿裏查出當地一一一三〇號話用戶的住址，然後連同收報人姓名一起開入電封投送。</p>
<p>郵箱號數代替收報人住址的性質和電話號數代替收報人住址差大不多。凡發給在收報局當地租有郵政信箱的收報人的電報，也可用郵箱號數代替收報人的住址，但必須寫明收報人的姓名，並在郵箱號數前面，加上「郵箱」二字，例如「上海郵箱（486）徐大中」（華文電報）或「Hsudahchung　Postal　Box　486Shanghai」（洋文電報），電局收到這張電報之後，就送交當地郵局投入上面指定號數的郵政信箱裏，聽由租箱人自取。從這裏，我們可以推想得到，要是租用信箱人並不隨時到郵局裏去提取，那張電報就可能遭受稽延。</p>
<p>如果收報人旣沒有電報掛號，又沒有電話或郵箱，那末，各方發給他的電報，就非得把名址詳細書寫不可，但請記住下面幾點：</p>
<p>（一）在街街里等等名詞可用號數代替之處，不必用街衖的完全名稱而祗用街街的號數，例如「（380）街」祗作二字。</p>
<p>（二）門牌號數可用阿拉伯字寫在括弧裏面，不必逐字寫出，例如「三百八十五號」要作六個字，但「（385）號」祗作二個字。</p>
<p>（三）門牌號數後面如有甲乙丙丁等字樣，可用洋文字ABCD替代，例如「三十二號甲」如寫做「（32A）號」祗作二字。</p>
<p>（四）收報人的稱呼，例如「先生」「女士」「局長」「老伯」等等，儘可能不用。</p>
<p>（五）名址如用英文書寫，那末，最好把收報人姓名完全拚出，例如把張家鈺寫做Changchiayu，這樣可以連成一字，如果寫做CY　Chang那就得分作三字計費，街道的名稱也可連寫，例如南京路可以寫做Nankingroad或NanKingrd。</p>
<p>（六）中外各國地名相同的地方很多，例如吾國陜西省省會西安原名長安，但浙江省裏也有一個長安縣；人們祗曉得智利國的首都是叫Santiago，誰知全世界叫Santiago的地方竟有四十九處之多，在這種塲合下，必須由發報人在地名後面加註國名或省名，線不致發錯。收報地名不論字數長短如「上海」，「哈爾濱」，「二里子河」，也不管地名後面是否加註國　或省名，一律祗作一　計費。（第四講完）</p>

<h3>The National Assembly Holds Its Seventh Meeting: Listens to Financial, Economic, and Grain Reports; Economic and Political Reviews to Be Combined Today</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 13th] The National Assembly held its seventh meeting at 9:25 AM on the 13th, with 173 representatives in attendance. The ninth group of the presidium was on duty, with Chairman He Yingqin presiding. After the minutes of the previous meeting were approved, the presidium reported on three matters: (1) the list of members of the Representative Eligibility Review Committee; (2) a temporary motion by 33 representatives, including Zhang Fang from Henan, requesting the continuation of the military review that was not completed on the 12th. The presidium decided that, before the agenda was changed, the economic report and review would proceed as scheduled on that day, and the military review would be continued at a later date; (3) motions from representatives of Henan and Shandong provinces, respectively, urging the rapid deployment of large reinforcements to aid Hubei and Bian (Kaifeng), as well as Changyi and Weifang, have been forwarded by the presidium to the Ministry of National Defense, and a special representative has been dispatched to report to Chairman Chiang. Subsequently, Chairman He announced the commencement of the economic report. However, representatives from Hebei, Chahar, Shandong, Henan, and the Northeast regions expressed strong objections to the second item in the presidium's report, arguing that North China was in imminent danger and that military matters were of paramount importance during the suppression of the rebellion. They insisted that no other items could be discussed before the military review was completed. The representatives from North China were highly emotional, and representatives from Henan even threatened to walk out. Although the presidium reported that the motion had been approved by a majority of representatives, the order remained chaotic. Fortunately, Zhang Fang, Xue Dubi, Zhang Zhenlu, and others strongly劝advised everyone, and a decision was made that the presidium would immediately hold a meeting to discuss changing the agenda. The public anger gradually subsided. At 10:15 AM, Finance Minister Yu Hongjun finally stood at the podium for the fourth time to begin his financial report. Yu stated that China's economic foundation was inherently weak, and that after the victory, everything needed to be rebuilt. The necessary expenditures for demobilization and suppressing the rebellion were extremely high. In terms of finance, besides minimizing emissions and increasing tax revenues as much as possible, the government would also use US$463 million in aid to stabilize prices and recover legal tender. Regarding the general situation of governance, he reported on four points: (1) Although the revenue and expenditure of the national treasury were difficult to match, the percentage of deficit was still less than the usual 30% before the war. (2) Tax reform would focus on direct taxes, and the improvement of income tax collection methods was expected to be effective. Regarding customs duties, new tax regulations suitable for domestic and foreign conditions would be formulated under the principle of not abandoning protective policies to increase tax revenue. Smuggling issues would also be strictly prevented and eliminated with cooperation from Hong Kong and Macau. The salt tax rate has been increased to 450,000 yuan per dan, which is more than 100,000 times higher than before the war. Currently, in order to increase tax revenue, production and sales loans are being promoted. In addition to requesting the Ministry of National Defense to pay attention to the security of Changlu, Huaihai, and other producing areas, efforts are being made to promote increased production in the coastal areas of South China. These three taxes and the commodity tax are the central government's main sources of revenue, but they are far from sufficient to meet the needs, and they have been greatly damaged during the war to suppress the rebellion. (3) The implementation of financial measures will be based on the principle of cooperating with finance. Loans will still be limited to production-related enterprises, and efforts to crack down on speculation and illegal operations will continue to actively reduce idle funds and stabilize the market. Regarding the total amount of legal tender issued, he guaranteed that it had not reached 70 trillion as of the end of last month. The government is currently selling enemy and puppet assets to strengthen the foundation of legal tender. Regarding the impact of the fluctuating exchange rate mechanism adopted to encourage exports on prices, measures are being planned to improve the situation. (4) A separate revenue and expenditure system has been established for local finance, which is expected to enrich local financial resources. Yu's report lasted 40 minutes. At 10:55 AM, the report was completed, and Chairman He announced a recess. At 10:20 AM, the meeting resumed. Chairman He reported that the presidium had convened an interim meeting and decided to change the agenda for the afternoon to military review, and the economic review would be combined with the political review on the 14th. If time was insufficient, it would be extended to the morning of the 18th. After this decision was accepted by the audience without objection, the heads of economy, transportation, and food successively made policy reports.</p>
<p>Minister of Economic Affairs Chen Qitian first stated that the economic policy was based on the Economic Reform Plan formulated by the Executive Yuan and passed by the State Council. To cooperate with the suppression of the rebellion and mobilization, the focus of the Ministry of Economic Affairs' work was to assist industry and commerce in increasing production, and to develop international trade to balance foreign income and expenditure, leaning towards administrative aspects and not asking about business. He then mentioned that the increased production of the Huadong and Huainan coal mines had achieved significant results, and that the profits from cotton yarn exports had reached US$30 million. After analyzing the reasons for the skyrocketing prices, he emphasized that suppressing the communist bandits, increasing legal tender reserves, increasing production, and making good use of foreign aid were the main methods of suppressing prices.</p>
<p>Minister of Transportation Yu Dawei reported on the current state of transportation with numbers. There were originally more than 30,000 kilometers of railways, of which 11,000 kilometers in the Northeast had been recovered and 3,000 kilometers were open to traffic. Now only 600 kilometers remain. The railways in the country have been damaged by bandits more than 6,000 times, with a length of more than 5,000 kilometers. Currently, 13,000 kilometers are open to traffic. For the construction of new lines, the main line from Guangzhou Bay to Dihua will be completed in six sections. The Duyun-Guiyang section of the Guizhou-Guangxi line will be open to military transport in the short term. Apart from the 1,600 kilometers of roads already in Xinjiang, there has been no new development in the interior. The current total tonnage of water transport is 1.03 million tons. As for postal and telecommunications services, they have been actively seeking progress in recent years, and have developed greatly compared with the past. The total number of postal items last year reached 100 million, and rural postal services are also making efforts to develop.</p>
<p>Minister of Food Yu Feipeng reported on food administration. Regarding the procurement of military grain, although the actual collection and borrowing were resumed in the 36th year, the huge amount of 40 million city stones was still insufficient. After last autumn, Shaanxi, Henan, Hubei, Anhui and other provinces were disturbed by bandits, and the loss of grain sources was even greater. The quotas of various provinces are difficult to collect in full, and the supply is becoming more difficult. Last winter and this spring, purchases from grain-producing areas were used to make up for the deficit. The allocation and sale of public education grain and people's grain, in addition to the refugee relief being coordinated by the Ministry of Social Affairs, the full allocation and sale of the five cities of Beijing, Shanghai, Ping, Tianjin, and Sui has already begun. The adjustment of civil food in various places is also being carried out with the assistance of the Four-Bank Loan. In the future, food administration will seek a path to abundance by increasing production, using foreign grain, and practicing strict economy. At 12:10 PM, the morning meeting was adjourned after Yu's report was completed.</p>
<p>Afternoon Agenda Changes: Continue Military Review</p>
<p>At 3:30 PM, the meeting resumed. According to the agenda changed with the consent of the conference in the morning, the military review continued. Chairman Yu Jiaju announced that the order of requests would be followed, with two representatives from each unit speaking. Liu Yizhou and 16 others successively put forward their opinions on military issues. Liu Yizhou from Henan pointed out that the Central Plains must be secured, and the strength of the national army was insufficient, which was extremely serious. He advocated seizing the time to compile and train 100 or 200 elite divisions in the Jiangnan area to consolidate South China and rescue North China. He Foqing advocated that rewards and punishments should be clearly defined to boost military morale and conform to public opinion. He said: "If General Fu Zuoyi has made achievements, he should be allocated new weapons and equipment, and not just receive empty words of praise. If General Chen Cheng has made mistakes, he should not be allowed to get away with it." Mongolian representative Ji Zhenfu raised the issue of the autonomy of Wangye Temple in Liaobei, and accused the military and political officials in charge of the Northeast takeover of negligence, so that it was impossible to use local armed forces when they wanted to. Zuoke Bagang'er emphasized that the residence of the Mongolian compatriots was the gateway to the northern border of the yuan family. Helping the Mongolian compatriots was precisely to protect the border areas. The government should pay attention to it quickly regardless of territorial divisions, and use the Mongolian compatriots' riding and shooting skills and patriotic enthusiasm to equip them with weapons to ensure their own safety and share the responsibility of national defense. His speech won applause from the audience. Yang Huaifeng and Wang Qian from Shanxi separately stated the importance of the strategic positions of the Linfen and Datong areas, and called for rescue. Dang Jiling and Wang Fan from Shaanxi pointed out that the rampant communist bandits in southern Shaanxi had affected the safety of Guanzhong, and those responsible for combat operations could no longer delay and conceal the situation. Zhang Tifang and Tang Hongye from Chahar reported that Zhangjiakou had been surrounded on all sides, and the nearest bandits were only 25 li away from the city. This was caused by the transfer of the national army stationed in Chahar, the emptiness of defense, and the extraction of all local men, resulting in the inability to defend themselves. Protecting Rehe and Chahar is the only way to protect Ping and Tianjin. The government should fully support Fu Zuoyi in ensuring Zhangyuan. After a recess at 4:45 PM, Liu Guilan and others from Suiyuan continued to plead for Fu, and advocated that Deng Baoshan and Ma Hongkui and other troops who had fought the most vigorously in northern Shaanxi should be allocated new equipment. Liu Rongbo from Jilin pointed out that there were many available civilian forces in the Northeast, but they had not been paid attention to and utilized, which was regrettable and sad. Liu Shougang from Hejiang put forward four points: (1) Equal emphasis should be placed on the Northeast and North China, but the Northeast is more important than North China. (2) Equal emphasis should be placed on national and local armed forces, but local armed forces are more important than national armed forces. (3) Tactics should match strategy. (4) Military affairs should match politics. He also proposed that a telegram of condolence should be sent to Wei Lihuang and Li Hong, who was holding on to Changchun, in the name of the conference. Yu Gui from Hejiang accused the Northeast national army of failing to defend itself and never considering attacking the vital parts of the communist bandits. After An Dongcui Rong severely criticized both Tai Shihui and Chen Cheng, he declared: The two should be responsible for three things: (1) delaying military opportunities, (2) losing the hearts of the people, and (3) manufacturing bandit troops in disguise. He also questioned why Minister Bai's military report did not mention a word about the war in the Northeast, and whether the government would give up the Northeast. Finally, he proposed that the only way out for the Northeast was to start employing Northeasterners to call on the public to restore their hometowns. Han Songnian from Hebei said: The emergency in North China was due to the deterioration of the situation in Northeast China, and Xiong Shi should be fully responsible for the situation in Northeast China. He said: "If such people are given high-ranking officials and generous salaries again, the future of the country will be unthinkable." Kong Fumin from Shandong advocated rectifying the political style and military discipline. All levels of administration should have real power to effectively implement government orders. Factories and schools in the rear should be closely organized to prevent the communist bandits from taking advantage of the situation. Sun Mingji from Rehe said: It is unreasonable for Rehe to be subordinate to two executive offices. The 13th Army is stationed as a lone army. Do the 7.5 million people need or not need a government? By 6:00 PM, two temporary motions were discussed: one was to provide effective measures for suppressing the rebellion, and it was decided that the presidium would hand it over to the secretariat for the government to pay attention to; one was to ask General Director Zhang Lisheng to report on election affairs, and it was decided to hand it over to the presidium to study and handle. The meeting adjourned at 6:10 PM.</p>

<h3>Representatives from Shanxi and Henan Petition: Demand Grain Transport to Taiyuan and Reinforcements to Zhengzhou and Kaifeng; President Zhang and Others Have Replied Separately</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 13th] More than 80 representatives from Shanxi, including Jin Wendeng, petitioned President Zhang and Ministers Gu Zhenggang and Yu Feipeng after the seventh meeting at around 6:00 PM on the 13th, requesting the rapid transportation of grain to Taiyuan, and a regular supply of grain seeds for emergency relief. Zhang and others told them that the government was extremely concerned about the northern provinces, and that 500 tons of surplus grain from the Executive Yuan would be shipped after the air freight of 42 billion was approved. The later food will be purchased and allocated as relief food after the US aid is allocated and the food is exchanged for money, or grain will be purchased and transported to Taiyuan with central loans. However, the air transport problem must be solved first. This is a difficult problem during the suppression of the rebellion. The representatives were very grateful and hoped that the government could deeply understand the critical situation in Shanxi, show compassion for the suffering of the people, and do its best to help solve various pending problems.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 13th] With the abandonment of Luoyang, Zhengzhou and Kaifeng are in urgent danger.

Zhang and more than a dozen others visited Lin Wei and Liu Fei at the Ministry of National Defense at 10:00 AM on the 13th, requesting the air transport of heavy troops to relieve the crisis in Zhengzhou and Kaifeng, send senior officials to sit in Zhengzhou and unify command, and order the 某 army to stationed in Kaifeng, and quickly issue the security brigade ammunition that had been approved last year. In addition to telling Lin about the deployment of Zhengzhou and Kaifeng, he agreed to the rest on the 14th. Liu said: Zhengzhou and Kaifeng will never be abandoned, and Luoyang can be recovered in two months.</p>

The center of the battle was still in the north, northwest, and southwest of Weixian. At midnight on the 12th, a part of the communist bandits broke in from the southwest Yuguan and launched a fierce street battle with the defending army. On the morning of the 13th, the defending army bravely counterattacked and finally repelled the bandits who had broken in. On the same night, a part of the communist bandits also broke in from the North Pass, and the battle situation was even more tragic.

<h3>Chronicles of the National Assembly: Military Matters Take Precedence Over Economic Affairs</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from This Newspaper] As battles raged in Northeast China, North China, and the Central Plains, the slogan of "Military Matters First" resurfaced in the National Assembly hall, where constitutional governance was being discussed. Yesterday, the verbal clashes during the military review had not yet been fully vented. This morning, during the economic report, the representatives demanded to continue the military review. Before the economic report could even begin, shouts of "No Report!" resounded throughout the chamber. "Military Matters Take Precedence Over Economic Affairs" was fully demonstrated by the representatives' emotions today. General He Yingqin, recently returned from the United States, chaired today's assembly. Although a seasoned veteran and former Chief of Staff of the eight-year War of Resistance, even he found today's scene difficult to control. He reported that 33 representatives, including Zhang Fang from Henan, had submitted a temporary motion to continue the military review. When the chairman decided to schedule a review, immediate opposition erupted from the upper gallery. Wang Mianzhi and Zhang Bingwu from Chahar took the lead, shouting, "Why won't you let us speak? Minister Bai didn't report on North China yesterday. Does he not want North China anymore?" Like a spring breeze stirring, a pool of still water was instantly rippled. Representatives from Northeast and North China responded from all over the hall. He Yingqin hurriedly explained that the chairman had already accepted the suggestion to continue the review, but today's agenda was the economic report, and the military review had to be postponed. Finance Minister Yu Hongjun still stepped onto the podium. He had just started with, "Today, I am ordered to report on finances. Our country's finances are extremely weak!" when he was immediately drowned out by shouts of "Military review is not finished; no report allowed!" He had no choice but to step down. He Yingqin put the agenda issue to a vote. The brilliant four-color light voting machine flashed, indicating that 163 representatives were in favor of not changing the agenda. The chairman, with a victorious smile, asked Minister Yu to report again, which sparked a round of intense applause in the hall. However, from the back, people shouted, "We want to walk out!" Minister Yu had to shake his head again and retreat from the podium. Half an hour after the meeting began, the upper and lower galleries were shouting as one. Many representatives stood up, seemingly preparing to leave. The chairman asked Minister Yu to report a second time, but this time he was interrupted by Wang Jinwen, a representative from Liaoning. The order of the meeting was almost impossible to maintain. He Yingqin repeatedly struck the gavel. Zhang Fang, Xue Dubi, Zhang Zhenlu, Lin Zigui, and others also ran to the back, earnestly persuading the northern representatives not to leave. After several tens of minutes of chaos, Minister Yu finally took the stage for the fourth time and completed his report. During the ten-minute break, the presidium met and accepted the representatives' opinion that "Military Matters Take Precedence Over Economic Affairs," deciding to continue the military review in the afternoon, allowing the remaining time in the morning for Ministers Chen Qida, Yu Dawei, and Yu Feipeng to each complete their economic reports in fifteen minutes, and moving the economic review to tomorrow.</p>
<p>In the afternoon, after the rain cleared, the representatives used this hard-won time to continue their criticisms of past military measures. Seventeen representatives spoke in succession, and apart from applause, it remained peaceful throughout. After the break, the number of representatives in the hall was sparse, barely reaching a thousand, as if the review had become a "war of attrition." All seventeen speakers were northern representatives, who both reviewed the successes and failures of the military in the north and took precautionary measures for South China. Sun Ming from Jehol reminded everyone to review whether South China had preventive measures against the communists. Many representatives proposed countermeasures to remedy past shortcomings, demanding to arm the troops fighting the communists. Su Ting and Liu Gui from Suiyuan repeatedly pleaded for assistance for Fu Zuoyi, hoping the central government could provide him with superior equipment. "If weapons are given to Commander-in-Chief Fu, he will not give them to the communists." The entire hall immediately erupted in enthusiastic applause. Yan Songnian from Hebei sternly criticized Xiong Shihui for harming the country. In the shouts, calls to overthrow Xiong Shihui were heard. Kong Fumin from Shandong spoke up for Wang Yaowu, saying that he did not even have the power to use county magistrates, which drew sympathy in the hall. The representatives called for clear rewards and punishments. Throughout the afternoon's military review, the merits and demerits of past military leaders were revealed. (April 13th, Nanjing)</p>

<h3>Editorial: Watching the Trends in Siamese Politics</h3>
<p>Since the coup d'état in Siam last November, Nai Khuang Aphaiwong has continued to organize a provisional government. It was not until early March of this year that he gained the trust of the House of Representatives and the recognition of the governments of China, Great Britain, the United States, and France. However, after only thirty days, Siam suddenly experienced another coup d'état. Under pressure from the military, Prime Minister Nai Khuang resigned, and the coup leader, Field Marshal Plaek Phibunsongkhram, Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces, staged a comeback, taking responsibility for organizing a new cabinet. Although the cabinet selections have been internally decided, they have not yet been finalized. The relationship between China and Siam has once again been plunged into a state of stagnation. However, the relationship between China and Siam is not only related to the economic development of Siam but also to the survival of the 3.5 million overseas Chinese in Siam. This is because Plaek Phibunsongkhram is an extremist who rejects overseas Chinese. He has adopted various unequal laws against our overseas Chinese, suppressing the education of our overseas Chinese, restricting the economic activities of our overseas Chinese, and even promulgated an emergency decree to expel our overseas Chinese. These painful experiences filled with blood and tears make it necessary for us to pay close attention to the dynamics of Plaek Phibunsongkhram's cabinet formation, and we must be especially vigilant about the fate of our 3.5 million overseas Chinese in Siam.</p>
<p>When Plaek Phibunsongkhram met with reporters on the 10th, he also expressed great concern about possible events between China and Siam. He said, "The Siamese government is studying the immigration laws of other countries and other laws to solve the problem of overseas Chinese in Siam." He also admitted that the Chinese do not have a good impression of him, so he is deeply afraid that "a slight mistake may cause unrest." Based on Reuters' simple report, it is not difficult to foresee how the future relationship between China and Siam will develop.</p>
<p>The course of this coup d'état is as follows: April 6th was the 166th anniversary of the founding of the Chakri Dynasty in Siam. While the entire Regency Council was paying respects in front of the statue of King Rama I on the banks of the Chao Phraya River in Bangkok, a major incident suddenly occurred in the city. A military group, wielding weapons, confronted Prime Minister Nai Khuang Aphaiwong and issued an ultimatum demanding that the government resign and allow a virtuous and talented person to take power. The ultimatum contained eight points, which were abstract and not specific, and focused more on personnel than policies. Nai Khuang did not resist and accepted the resignation. On the 7th, the State Council held a meeting, and Nai Khuang proposed the resignation of the cabinet, which the State Council refused to accept, leading to a deadlock. That afternoon, the Regency Council appointed Plaek Phibunsongkhram to organize a new cabinet, and on the 10th, the new cabinet was largely organized. Nai then asked the Parliament to vote on the new cabinet's confidence on the 15th, and he also asked all countries to recognize the new regime. The attitude of various countries towards this coup d'état in Siam has not yet been expressed, and it is expected that they will quietly observe the internal changes in Siam.</p>
<p>Plaek Phibunsongkhram is the leader of the extremists and the military in Siam. During the Pacific War, he had the reputation of being the "Mussolini of the East" with his dictatorial regime. During his time in power, he was anti-British and anti-American, pro-Axis, anti-Chinese, and advocated "Pan-Thaiism," viewing the Chinese as enemies. After the war, the totalitarian politics of Siam collapsed, and Plaek was once detained but later released. After being dormant for a while, he began to stir again. First, he organized the Conservative Party, intending to make a comeback. However, due to the failure to form a party, he secretly led the military in a bloodless coup d'état on the evening of November 8th last year, overthrowing the government of Luang Thamrongnawasawat. Even the former Prime Minister Pridi Banomyong fled after hearing the news. After the incident, due to pressure from international public opinion, Nai Khuang, the leader of the Democratic Party, was brought out to be responsible for organizing a provisional government, but it was not recognized by various countries. A general election was held on January 29th this year, and a new parliament was established. Nai Khuang won the victory of being elected by the people, overwhelming Plaek Phibunsongkhram's election campaign. Nai Khuang was ordered to form a cabinet on February 20th, and the domestic parliament voted on the confidence on March 5th. On March 6th, various countries recognized it as the legitimate government of Siam.</p>
<p>Therefore, the most noteworthy aspect of this coup d'état is that international factors outweigh domestic factors. Nai Khuang understands this very well, so he is willing to step down voluntarily. The current international situation is moving towards polarization. "Red coups" have gained an absolute advantage in Eastern and Central Europe. Recently, even Czechoslovakia, which is known as the democratic fortress of Eastern and Central Europe, declared the death penalty in a coup d'état overnight. Many people around the world feel uneasy about the red threat. Plaek Phibunsongkhram is a sensitive person. He witnessed the trend of the world situation and believed that there was an opportunity to take advantage of it. Therefore, he used anti-communism as a smokescreen and used force to force the Nai Khuang government to resign. After the coup d'état, Plaek Phibunsongkhram himself also said: "The new government's policy is neither left-leaning nor right-leaning. I personally am an anti-communist." The communist forces in Siam are not very strong, and there is no need to adopt an anti-communist policy in domestic affairs. Isn't the coup d'état just a fuss? Therefore, he thoroughly explained his anti-communist aspirations, and he announced: "The only left-wing color in Siam today is the red flag on the roof of the Soviet Embassy in Bangkok." From this, it can be seen that Plaek Phibunsongkhram's anti-communism is a smokescreen, an excuse, and we must not believe it.</p>
<p>From the above, it is clear that Plaek Phibunsongkhram is using "anti-communism" as a name to fulfill his ambition to seize power. The United Kingdom, the United States, France, and the Netherlands can see the development of the Siamese coup d'état even more clearly than we do. We hope that the government authorities of various countries will pay special attention to Plaek Phibunsongkhram's political ambitions and must not be fooled and immediately recognize him; otherwise, this coup d'état will become the death knell of Siamese democracy. This requires special caution from our diplomatic authorities. Plaek Phibunsongkhram's government must not be recognized until Plaek Phibunsongkhram guarantees that he will not borrow the corpse to revive the soul and re-establish laws that oppress overseas Chinese. At the same time, in diplomacy, we should actively engage and unite with the United Kingdom, the United States, France, and the Netherlands to deal with Plaek Phibunsongkhram, so as to ensure that Siamese democracy is not destroyed, and also to ensure that the lives of our 3.5 million overseas Chinese are effectively protected!</p>

<h3>Taiwan's Electricity Supply Insufficient: Plan to Add Three Power Plants. First Batch of Funds Have Been Negotiated and Contract Signed.</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Taipei, 13th] Provincial Chairman Wei Daoming recently told a group of reporters from Shanghai who arrived in Taiwan on the 12th: "At present, the Sun Moon Lake power plant generates 125,000 kilowatts, while the province's demand is 136,000 kilowatts. Future demand will continue to increase significantly. Relying solely on Sun Moon Lake for power supply is not enough. It is necessary to build three additional power plants: Wulai, Wushe, and Tianleng. After these three power plants are completed, they can generate an additional 120,000 kilowatts, which is estimated to take three years and cost at least 6 million US dollars." Liu Jinyu, general manager of Taiwan Power Company, told a reporter from the Central News Agency: "I went to the United States last spring to borrow 12.7 million US dollars from the US Export-Import Bank and manufacturers for the purpose of repairing and expanding the province's power facilities. I went to Shanghai last month to continue discussing this matter. Now, the first batch of this loan, totaling 2 million US dollars, has been negotiated with Westinghouse Electric Corporation of the United States as a short-term loan, to be repaid in two years, guaranteed by the Central Bank and the Bank of China, and was officially signed in Shanghai on April 1 this year. However, this amount is only for ordering the most urgently needed equipment and transformers to replenish the two power plants in the Sun Moon Lake area."</p>

<p>[Central News Agency, This City] The first batch of private trade representatives from our country to Japan previously reported to the government that their work had failed to progress, and a special representative, Zeng Jigu, was dispatched back to the country to report to the government and request that a solution be found quickly. Mr. Zeng has already returned to Shanghai from Nanjing and told reporters that his trip to Nanjing was fruitful. The account visa method has been approved by the Executive Yuan and has been ordered to be implemented by the relevant agencies, so private trade with Japan can now be started. He said: The account visa method approved by the Executive Yuan stipulates that the commercial specialist of the Ministry of Economic Affairs will issue a certificate, and then the export-import license will be issued by the Transportation and Management Committee, which is slightly different from the original plan. As for the trade policy with Japan, it has now been decided that goods that can be sold to Europe and the United States, such as bristles, tung oil, raw hides, soybeans, etc., should be sold to Europe and the United States first to earn foreign exchange.

Most of the organizers are educated in the Netherlands. It is pointed out that their organization of a party is not intended to separate the overseas Chinese from their compatriots born in this country. It is generally believed that Zhang Tiancong, the current advisor to Mook, is the most suitable leader for the future revolutionary political party, and he has been elected as the chairman of the Preparatory Committee.</p>

For example, during the war, the residents of Fuyang comforted the officers and soldiers defending the city and handled the supply of military supplies day and night. All of this proves that the people of Northern Huai have done their best in providing great and noble labor to the National Army. At the same time, they were also deeply hated by the bandits. The bandits burned, killed, looted, and plundered on the outskirts of Fuyang. Now, there are no complete walls in the houses 40 li inside and outside Fuyang, and hundreds of thousands of refugees in Fuyang, Taihe, Linquan, and other counties have no homes to return to. The wails are everywhere, and it is heartbreaking. The local National Army is launching a campaign for officers and soldiers to donate rice, and is cooperating with the local government to provide emergency relief.</p>

<h3>The Case of Killing Mother-in-Law in Taiwan Province is Closed, Sentence to Be Pronounced on the 20th</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper, Taipei, 13th] The case of Chen Sangang, who killed his mother-in-law Cai Shenshi due to jealousy, which once caused a sensation in Taiwan Province, was held in a Taipei court today. The prosecutor believed that although Chen deserved to be punished, the deceased not only condoned her daughter's adultery, but also forced her son-in-law to divorce, causing Chen to commit the crime under extreme stimulation, and that his higher education should be taken into consideration for a reduced sentence. The court will pronounce the sentence on the 20th. As for the part of the case involving Chen Gengxin's adultery and obstruction of the family, because the accomplice Cai Sulan refused to appear in court, the case will be interrogated again after detention. In addition, the court stated that Chen Gengxin's previous accusation against Taiwan Province reporters for defamation cannot be established because Chen's crime is conclusive.</p>

<h3>Field Property Dispute Filial Son Murders Father</h3>
<p>Criminal Zhou Wende Escorted to Qingpu</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper 12th Dispatch] A case of a direct son murdering his own father occurred on the 4th in Dongzhoujiao, Erbao, Zhaotun Town. The criminal Zhou Wende fled to Shanghai after the incident but was still captured. The details are as follows: Zhou Boyun, a resident of the area, is 76 years old, thrifty, and has considerable assets. His eldest son, Wende, and second son, Wude, had already separated their households. Wude passed away ten years ago, leaving behind a posthumous son named Bingzhong, who was greatly favored by his grandfather, causing Wende dissatisfaction. At the beginning of this month, due to a field property dispute, Wende believed that his father favored his nephew, harbored resentment, and conceived the evil intention of murdering his father. At 6:00 PM on the 4th, the old man was alone by the river in front of his door, washing a chamber pot when Wende saw him. He then called his son Bingwen (the eldest grandson of the old man) and pushed the old man into the water from behind. The water was shallow and reached only his waist. He then forcefully pressed him down until he sank, then fled home. Fortunately, Zhou Fengming witnessed the incident and quickly rescued him. He was already dying but was still able to verbally describe the process of being murdered by his son. Villagers gathered and reported to the township office, which immediately arrested the criminal Zhou Wen..., but he... Fortunately, the law is inescapable, and the authorities learned that he was hiding at a friend's flour mill on Niuzhuang Road in Shanghai. They sent personnel to Shanghai to cooperate with the Old Zha Police Station to arrest him on the previous day, and he was escorted... for legal proceedings on the 11th.</p>
<h3>New Look of Humen Fortress</h3>
<p>— Our Newspaper Special Correspondent Liang Feng</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper Guangzhou 11th Airmail] If we travel by water from Guangzhou to Hong Kong, going south along the Pearl River, after traveling about half the distance, the muddy yellow river water will gradually turn碧green. A natural boundary line is drawn between the yellow and green colors. This is the end of the lower reaches of the Pearl River. There, we will discover a strait, surrounded by mountains on both sides resembling dragons coiling and tigers crouching. A gap is exposed in the middle. This is the Humen Fortress, which guards the throat of the Pearl River and is the gateway to South China. It stands opposite Hong Kong and Macau outside the mouth of the Pearl River, and its situation is very dangerous. Since the eighth year of Shunzhi during the Qing Dynasty, troops have been stationed there for defense. It has been through the Opium War and the War of Resistance Against Japan, giving the enemy a great blow, which shows its value in military geography. The "doorkeeper" guarding this national gate now is the Humen Fortress Command.</p>
<p>Small Patrol Boat Five Hours</p>
<p>We obtained the consent of the Fortress Command in advance to visit this historic fortress. We took a small patrol boat from the Naval Fourth Base Command, sailing against the wind and waves for five hours. We were already forty nautical miles away from Guangzhou. That was Taiping Town, Dongguan County, where the Humen Fortress Command is located. We abandoned the boat and went ashore. Although the town only had two main streets, the noise of restaurants, teahouses, and theaters, and the bustling crowds on the streets were very lively. This place is sixty Chinese miles away from Dongguan County and can also be directly reached from Hong Kong by land. The transportation is very convenient, so commerce is also very prosperous. Taiping Park in the town is the place where revolutionary martyr Zhu Zhixin died in the past. There is now a monument erected, and next to the monument is the "Zhixin Memorial Hospital," both built by later generations to admire the martyrs. Looking north from there, not far away, there is a large village called Humen Village. It is said that there were originally more than a thousand houses, but they were all destroyed by the enemy during the occupation.</p>
<p>Massive Forts Speaking</p>
<p>Taiping Town is only the command center of the Humen Fortress. All the forts are located more than ten miles away at the estuary. The more famous ones are "Shajiao", "Dajiao", "Xiansheng", "Weiyuan", "Suilei" and other forts. The largest of these is "Shajiao", which is sixteen Chinese miles away from Taiping Town. That place is where Lin Zexu burned opium in the past. There is now a "Lin Gong Zexu Memorial Tablet" standing tall and dry by the sea for people to pay their respects. Next to it are several abandoned cannons lying on the ground. One of them is more than two feet long and is said to be a product of the Krupp factory in Germany. However, the changes of the times and the advancement of science have made it an ancient cannon that is only suitable for people to appreciate. Behind the monument is the "Coastal Platform", with stone steps to climb. After passing through a winding and gloomy tunnel, you come out to the fort, and further up is the pointing post. The terrain there is higher, and several houses are built under the shade of green trees, backed by mountains and facing the sea. The environment is quiet. If it weren't for the massive cannons all around, it would be easy to think of it as a villa hanging on the corner of the sea.</p>
<p>Natural Fortress Locks Heavy Door</p>
<p>Looking at the overall map of Humen's terrain, it is as if there are several small doors inside a large door. "Shajiao" and "Dajiao" face each other, like a pair of crab claws. This is the outermost gate. Going in, there are also Lower Hengdang, Upper Hengdang, Dahushan, Xiaohushan, and other inner gates. If the heavy doors are deeply locked, the enemy will indeed not cross the pond half a step, so it is said to be a natural fortress. It is a pity that after the occupation, because the Japanese often occupied Hong Kong, they believed that Humen had lost its military value. They completely removed the heavy cannons above the fortress, and thoroughly destroyed the rest, turning the fortress into wasteland. We only restored it after victory. The Fortress Command was restored on June 6, 1946. On the one hand, it organized and trained troops and built barracks. On the other hand, it sent personnel to Wuhan, Xiamen, Hainan Island and other places to receive and transport the sent cannons. This work was quite difficult, and they were praised by their superiors for their hard work. After Song Ziwen took charge of Guangdong, he attached great importance to this national defense fortress. Recently, he has obtained approval from the central government to approve the department to increase the establishment of the Third Garrison Battalion, a Fortress Artillery Platform, and add seven radar sets, which will make the fortress's equipment more complete.</p>
<p>Garrison and Pacification Combined</p>
<p>The jurisdiction of the Humen Fortress is quite large, including Dongguan and Binan counties, divided into: (1) the Fortress Main Area (with the headquarters' current location as the center within a radius of 30 Chinese miles), (2) the Forward Fortress Area (Tangjiawan, Qi'ao, Lingding Island to Nantou area), (3) the Joint Fortress (Daya Bay area), and other three major areas. Their jurisdiction is vast, so in addition to "garrison", they also have to undertake pacification work. In March last year, they were ordered to undertake the pacification tasks of Zhongshan, Shunde, Dongguan, and Baoan counties. In November of the same year, because the communist bandits set up checkpoints on the north bank of Dapeng Bay to collect taxes, thereby enriching their funds and expanding their strength, they were also dispatched to sweep away the bandits and assist the customs in restoring the checkpoints. They achieved the expected results in each operation and were awarded a commendation and merit by the Ministry of National Defense.</p>
<p>Coastal Major Fortress Plan</p>
<p>Director Song of the Provisional Headquarters believes that the Shenzhen Station at the junction of Guangdong and Hong Kong is important. Recently, he ordered Zhang Zongliang, the Commander of the Fortress, to be stationed in Shenzhen to unifiedly command the local military, police, and military police to ensure local safety. This task is even more important.</p>
<p>In addition, they also have a plan to establish the Humen Fortress as a new type of coastal major fortress, abolishing the past "closed type" and adopting the "expanded type", and re-determining the location of the artillery. This plan has recently been approved by the Ministry of National Defense and is being constructed step by step. In the near future, our southern gate will certainly be more consolidated.</p>

<h3>Stalin on Soviet-Finnish Relations</h3>
<p>Saying that Large and Small Countries Can Be Equal</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper News] London 13th Broadcast: Moscow News, Stalin expressed his opinion when he hosted the Finnish delegation on April 7, saying that if there is sufficient time and continuous efforts, suspicion between countries can be eliminated. This opinion reveals a glimmer of hope for reducing suspicion between East and West. According to Stalin, since expressing his views on international issues during his meeting with Stetson last year, he has remained silent, and this is the first time he has expressed his views.</p>
<p>[Reuters London 13th Electric] Moscow Radio today first published Marshal Stalin's speech at the signing of the Soviet-Finnish Mutual Assistance Treaty on April 8, saying that most politicians in powerful countries despise small countries with an arrogant attitude, but only the Soviet Union recognizes the Soviet-Finnish treaty as a treaty between two equal countries. Stalin said: "This treaty is a turning point in the relations between the two countries. For 150 years, there has been mutual distrust between Russia and Finland. I sincerely hope that the two countries can abandon the long-term distrust of the past from now on and enter a new relationship of mutual trust. The treaty signed between the two countries must break this distrust and establish a new foundation for relations between the two nations. We hope that everyone here today, as well as others in Finland and the Soviet Union, can understand this. Many people do not believe that equal relations can be established between large and small countries, but only the Soviet people believe that such relations can exist. The Soviet people believe that all countries, regardless of size, have their own characteristics that other countries cannot have. Therefore, all countries should be equal, so although Finland is a small country, the Soviet Union still regards it as an equal country and signs a treaty with it."</p>

<p>[Reuters Berlin 12th Electric] When the foreign ministers of the sixteen countries hold a conference here on Friday, it is believed that Bevin and Bidault will take this opportunity to discuss the Soviet Union's recent actions in Berlin.

Rumors that the foreign ministers of the United Kingdom, the United States, and France will immediately hold a meeting to discuss Soviet actions have also been solemnly denied by the British and French foreign ministries.</p>

Symington urged the passage of a plan to establish seventy air force groups, saying that the United States must win in the air, as it cannot compete with the Soviet Union in land forces.

<p>[Reuters, Washington, 12th] The House Armed Services Committee debated the conscription bill fiercely. Defense Secretary Forrestal, who attended to present his views today, strongly stated that peace could be achieved if the United States could straightforwardly express its determination not to tolerate the destruction of Western civilization in Europe. This is not a peace obtained through a long-term war of attrition, but a peace created by giving aggressors advance warning. Forrestal emphasized the need for a strong air force and army to protect bases, a large navy to maintain maritime traffic, and a central intelligence agency. Forrestal also told the committee that, according to Dr. Bush, chairman of the Atomic Energy Research and Development Board, the Soviet Union already possesses the scientific knowledge and procedures to manufacture atomic bombs, but lacks the industrial capacity to do so.</p>

<p>[Central News Agency, Success Lake, 12th] United Nations observers point out that major leaders of American foreign policy, such as Marshall and Vandenberg, are opposed to amending the Charter, and most UN officials are deeply concerned that any proposal by Congress to fundamentally alter the world organization, even if unsuccessful, will lead to the rapid disintegration of the United Nations. Although the views of the seventeen senators may clearly represent a strong trend, there is currently very little chance of them being adopted by Congress.</p>
<h3>Italian Prime Minister Accepts Communist Challenge; Arrives in Milan to Deliver Speech; Communist Call for Strike Ultimately Fails</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Rome, 13th] Italian Prime Minister De Gasperi accepted the challenge of Italian Communist leader Togliatti and is scheduled to go to Milan, the stronghold of Communist forces in northern Italy, on the 13th to deliver a speech. De Gasperi is currently touring the country giving speeches. His next speech was originally scheduled to be delivered in Sicily, but after Togliatti hinted yesterday that De Gasperi would not dare to speak in Milan, De Gasperi made a temporary decision to go to Milan. As Italy enters the final week before the general election, the General Confederation of Labor, led by the Communist Party, issued an order on the 12th to implement a one-hour general strike to test its strength.</p>
<p>[United Press, Rome, 13th] The one-hour nationwide general strike called by the Italian trade unions yesterday has failed. There was only one instance of anti-communist riots.</p>
<h3>Italy to Have All Robbed Gold Returned</h3>
<p>Value of $31.1 Million</p>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 12th] The State Department revealed that the Tripartite Gold Commission, which reviews requests for the return of gold robbed by Germany during the war, has decided to grant almost all of Italy's request for the return of robbed gold. When this British, American, and French commission made its first decision on allocation on October 17 of last year, Italy only received gold worth $4 million. The Tripartite Commission's latest resolution will allow Italy to recover gold worth $31.1 million soon.</p>
<h3>South Korean Elections Approaching; People Eagerly Register</h3>
<p>[New Asia News Agency, Seoul, 13th] Lieutenant General Hodge made the following statement today regarding the general election: The people of South Korea are actively participating in the election.

<h3>General Chennault on US Policy Toward China</h3>

<p>Translated by our editorial office</p>
<p>(18) The Last Year of Wartime Cooperation</p>
<p>The situation in our last year of wartime cooperation with China after General Stilwell was recalled in 1944 finally proved that there were reasonable and effective ways to deal with President Chiang and his government.</p>
<p>Before General Wedemeyer succeeded Stilwell as theater commander, those who defended Stilwell always said that the situation in China required Stilwell's old methods of "pleading, condemning, and treating rudely," but these methods were not considered necessary for Stilwell's successor, and in my opinion, they became necessary for Stilwell because of his prejudices.</p>
<p>I believe that the entire unfortunate record of the theater command under Stilwell can make it a glorious chapter in Sino-American relations. I especially believe that the tragedy of eastern China in 1944 could have been avoided with the materials he had at his disposal at the time.</p>
<p>When the fate of Guilin and Liuzhou—and therefore the fate of eastern China—was determined by the Japanese offensive, the theater command reluctantly allowed only 500 tons of supplies to be given to the defenders of the two cities. This was the first and last direct assistance to Chinese ground forces during Stilwell's tenure, and it came so late that it further illustrates his previous shortcomings.</p>
<p>Wedemeyer's method completely proved this point. During the remaining period of Sino-American wartime cooperation, Wedemeyer handled relations with the central government on a basis of mutual respect, which alleviated much of the damage caused in 1942–44.</p>
<p>He buried the previous hostile relationship between the theater command and the Chinese leaders. In addition, he buried the previous open encouragement of the Chinese Communist Party during the remaining period of the war against Japan. But our strange attitude of encouraging the CCP was later revived and gradually died out in 1947 and 1948.</p>
<p>For those who might argue that Wedemeyer did not face similar problems to those faced by Stilwell after the loss of eastern China, it is worth pointing out that the Japanese offensive launched in the summer of 1945 against Zhijiang, one of our forward air bases in Hunan Province, caused similar difficulties.</p>
<p>The Chinese ground forces actually engaged in combat at that time were not trained or equipped by the Americans, but they received emergency assistance when the Japanese offensive began. The ground forces were heavily dependent on air supply, but this time they received air supply to the maximum extent.</p>
<p>In short, Wedemeyer decided that Zhijiang must be defended. He gained the confidence of the Chinese leadership rather than shaking their confidence. He helped the ground forces gain vitality and guided them, but did not want to gain command.</p>
<p>As a result, the Japanese army was defeated or driven out, and Zhijiang was saved. Although the New Sixth Army, trained and equipped by the United States and with outstanding achievements in Burma, was airlifted to Zhijiang as a reserve force, there was no need to participate in combat.</p>
<p>But this new relationship with China came too late, and Washington was already prejudiced against China. Otherwise, I am sure that our post-war policy toward China would never have advocated the Chinese Communist Party joining the Nanjing government.</p>
<p>I feel that Secretary of State Marshall's post-war attitude toward the China issue was largely influenced by Stilwell's reports. His efforts in arbitration unwittingly fell into the trap of the Chinese Communist Party and aggressive international communism.</p>
<p>I believed this at the time, and subsequent developments have proven this point.</p>
<p>Stilwell's "open flirtation" with the Chinese Communist Party was never more clear than in an event that occurred nine months after he left China.</p>
<p>In July 1945, about a month before the final collapse of Japan, Stilwell, who was then commander of the US Tenth Army on Okinawa, proposed a plan to directly assist the Chinese Communist Party, which attracted considerable attention in Washington, and the result was that it was forwarded to Wedemeyer for his opinion.</p>
<p>I had already retired and was no longer commander of the Fourteenth Air Force and was resting in Chongqing, so I learned about this matter.</p>
<p>In short, Stilwell's suggestion was that the Tenth Army should land on the coast of Jiangsu Province north of Shanghai to make contact with the Chinese Communist army, give the Communist Party American arms and ammunition, and let them attack Shanghai, which was occupied by the Japanese army.</p>
<p>This proposal secretly caused a commotion in Chongqing, perhaps including an emergency protest from the central government, and as a result, it was not implemented. It goes without saying that having the Communist Party occupy Shanghai at the end of the war was tantamount to handing over the heartland of China, the lower reaches of the Yangtze River, to the Communist Party.</p>
<p>In our past ten years of relations with China, we have traveled a perilous road. The difficulties have not passed, but I believe we have crossed the crossroads and made the right choice. With proper guidance, Americans know how to find the right path.</p>
<p>But we have indeed suffered irreparable losses, the most important of which is time. History seems to be telling us, like a stern teacher, whether we have delayed for too long. (The End)</p>

<h3>US Naval Air Transport Squadron Suffers First Accident; Transport Plane Crashes and Burns in Jiangwan; Right Engine Malfunctions After Takeoff, Touching Ground and Catching Fire; Fifteen Injured, Including Pilot and Naval Personnel</h3>
<p>[News from Our Newspaper] A US Naval Air Transport Squadron C46 twin-engine transport plane, carrying 25 people including US naval personnel and the pilot, took off from Shanghai for Qingdao at around 12 noon yesterday. About ten minutes after taking off from Jiangwan Airport, the right engine malfunctioned. The plane immediately turned back to the airport. As it approached the runway, the malfunctioning engine stopped running, forcing it to land in a field about half a kilometer west of the airport. After the plane touched the ground, it immediately caught fire. The pilot and passengers opened the emergency door on the plane and jumped out one after another in the nick of time. Fortunately, there were no deaths, except for fifteen people who suffered minor and serious injuries.</p>
<p>After the accident, the nearby 101st Rear Hospital of our army witnessed the scene and immediately sent people with stretchers to bandage and provide first aid to the injured. Upon receiving the news, the US Marine Corps immediately dispatched ambulances to the scene of the accident to transport the injured to the US Naval Hospital for treatment. At the same time, fire trucks were dispatched to extinguish the flames in the plane. Because there was a ditch nearby, a Yonglong leather belt was used. After an hour or so of firefighting, the smoke and fire were completely extinguished.</p>
<p>When reporters arrived at the scene of the accident, the fuselage was still smoking. The plane crashed about 30 yards east of the Tianle Temple behind the 101st Rear Hospital, located west of Yixian Road and north of Min Road. The fuselage was blue-gray in color, with the number A29, 39512. The nose, right engine, and abdomen of the fuselage were completely destroyed, and the right wing was also broken. According to eyewitnesses, when the plane made a forced landing, it broke a utility pole in the farmland, splitting the power lines. The pilot rushed south towards Tianle Temple, but fortunately, the engine hit the ground 30 yards away, and at the same time made a sharp turn, changing from south to north and stopping, otherwise Tianle Temple would have been destroyed.</p>
<p>The names of the injured pilot and passengers are listed below, as investigated: Pilot Kempson, Co-pilot Bagley, Navigator Lopes, Radio Operator Jenkins, Marine Corps members Louse, Cohen, Kepiel, Genny, Joly, Johnson, Coates, Kim, Cocklan, Black, and Coper, totaling fifteen people. Although their injuries range in severity, none are life-threatening. According to US Navy personnel, this is the first accident in the two years of activity of the Naval Air Transport Squadron.</p>
<p>Another report: When the plane crashed and caught fire, Wang Yongyan, the training director on duty at the 101st Rear Hospital, immediately led medical and nursing staff and guards with stretchers to the scene of the plane crash. While dispatching troops to guard the surrounding area, they rushed to the plane to do their best to rescue. At that time, only the right wing of the plane was on fire, and the flames were fiercely approaching. A person in the plane jumped out of the window and accidentally landed in the fire. In a critical situation, Medical Director Pan Liren, Director of the Second Sanatorium Li Shengqing, and others bravely rescued him from the fire. Because of heavy bleeding from the head, they immediately administered first aid and rescued other injured people separately. Soon, air force ambulances also arrived and took the injured people to the hospital for treatment.</p>

<h3>Index Issue Research Association; Trade Unions Do Not Recognize; Statement That No Notification Received, No Representatives Participated</h3>
<p>[News from Our Newspaper] A spokesperson for the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions declared yesterday: Recently, it was heard that a "Living Index Compilation Issue Research Association" was established. The Federation of Trade Unions has not yet received any notification from the association, nor have any workers' representatives participated. Because the compilation of the living index is closely related to the vital interests of 800,000 workers in Shanghai, it is necessary to pay attention to what the association is researching. Before understanding the purpose of the association, the Federation of Trade Unions does not intend to recognize the existence of this organization. If the results produced by the association's activities have any impact on the living index, the workers have no obligation to accept them. As for the allocation of daily necessities, the Federation of Trade Unions expresses its welcome.</p>
<h3>Parents of Persecuted Students Report on Jinan University Brawl</h3>

<h3>Establishment of Police Kiosk Inquiry Network; Nine Provisional Measures Established</h3>
<p>[News from Our Newspaper] The 105th Municipal Government Conference, based on the recommendation of the Municipal Council, decided to establish an inquiry network in each police kiosk in the Lichuan urban area. Each bureau will prepare a list of the names and telephone numbers of the responsible persons and distribute them to each police kiosk for reference. Citizens can go to the nearby police kiosk or call to request answers to any questions related to municipal affairs. It is reported that the provisional measures for the inquiry network have been formulated, totaling nine items, including five points regarding the scope of business of the inquiry office: (1) Explanation of relevant laws and regulations, (2) Matters related to the promotion of business by various municipal departments, (3) General information on the personnel situation and telecommunications contact of various bureaus of the municipal government, (4) Inquiries about the names of roads and bridges in the municipal district, (5) Other inquiries related to citizens. The affairs of the inquiry office are concurrently handled by the on-duty patrol officer. The measures also stipulate that the on-duty patrol officer shall not be arrogant when answering inquiries from citizens, and if there are any questions that are difficult to answer, they should immediately forward them to the relevant competent departments for answers.</p>
<h3>Mayor Presides Over Ceremony; Puhuitang Dam Opened</h3>
<p>[News from Our Newspaper] The Shanghai Winter Relief Association's 3rd and 4th Labor Relief Office's dredging of the Puhuitang project in Longhua District has been completed. The dam opening and water release ceremony was held at No. 1 Zhongshan West Road Bridge at 3:00 PM yesterday. Wu Guozhen, Zhao Zukang, Wu Kaixian, Xiang Changquan, Wang Xianqing, Zhu Guoxi, Yang Jishi, the district chief of the district, and more than 20 representatives of the district people attended. Mayor Wu personally presided over the water release ceremony. Wu and his party first went to the Xiaozha Bridge Town National Elementary School in Longhua District to hold a simple ceremony, then set off to the Puhuitang south of Tushanwan in Xujiahui to hold the ceremony. The Caohejing refugee children played music, and two young girls from the Central Elementary School presented flowers to Mayor Wu. Mayor Wu then shoveled up the first pile of earth dam amid the melodious music, and then the dam opened with the help of two refugees, and the water flowed in, and the water release ceremony was completed.</p>
<p>Puhuitang, originally named Puzhaohe, its upper reaches converge with the counties along Taihu Lake, exiting from Xueshan Lake between Qingpu and Songjiang, winding east into the city boundary, passing through Qibao, Hongqiao, and Xiaoguanqiao towns, passing through Zhaohongbang and Rixun Port and entering the Huangpu River. The pond is the fourth main river in the city and an important channel for rice and grain boats from the Taihu Lake basin to come to Shanghai. After dredging, it benefits the entire city, which is truly profound and far-reaching.</p>
<h3>Petitioners for the Dance Industry Disrupt the Social Affairs Bureau; Family Members of the Accused File a Petition; Request for Re-examination Rejected</h3>
<p>[News from Our Newspaper] In the case of dancers and employees of the dance industry disrupting the Social Affairs Bureau during a petition, the family members of the arrested dancers Hong Xiaoping and others filed a petition with the District Court requesting a retrial to maintain the rule of law and respect human rights because the dancers had been detained in the police station for too long. The District Court received two petitions, one filed by 37 family members of the dancers Hong Xiaoping, Tang Meiyun, and Feng Aina, and the other filed by the family members of the employees Hong Zhenbang, Su Guanlin, Han Yongbao, and Chen Feilong. After receiving the petitions, the District Court summarily rejected them because the case was being handled by the Special Criminal Court. According to Zhou Yizhi, the lawyer handling the case, the Special Criminal Court handles cases of communist bandits. If the police investigation of the case cannot prove that there is any suspicion of communist bandits, why is it being transferred to the Special Criminal Court for trial? This is truly puzzling.</p>
<h3>Continued Implementation of Labor Relief; Second Phase of Measures Prepared</h3>
<p>[News from Our Newspaper] The Shanghai 36th Year Winter Relief Association will end at the end of April according to the original plan. However, most of the refugees are still unable to return to their hometowns, and relief cannot be ended. Therefore, the Municipal Government Conference decided to organize the Shanghai Relief Committee to be responsible for continuing to handle refugee labor relief and shelter relief matters. The Labor Relief Committee has prepared a second phase of the labor relief plan, focusing on the relocation and adjustment of various labor relief shelters. The work includes: the 1st and 2nd Labor Relief Offices continuing to dredge the Shajing Port, the 3rd and 4th Labor Relief Offices dredging the North and South Xinjing, the 5th Labor Relief Office dredging the western section of the Zoumatang, the 6th Labor Relief Office dredging the Xigoujing, the 7th Labor Relief Office dredging the Dushitai Pu, the 8th Labor Relief Office dredging the Yangjia Gou and repairing the Donggao Road, the 9th Labor Relief Office repairing the Pudong Avenue and the Chupu Branch Road, the 10th Labor Relief Office dredging the Gaohang Road, Hutang Road and the Jiubaoshan City Path, the 11th Labor Relief Office dredging the Shenji River, the 12th Labor Relief Office dredging the Zhaojia Bang, and the 13th Labor Relief Office dredging the Huxi Xiaohang.</p>
<h3>Taipei City Councilors' Inspection Group Visits Mayor Wu Yesterday Morning</h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] The Taipei City Councilors' inspection group visited Mayor Wu at the City Hall at 10 o'clock yesterday morning. Mr. Wu personally received them, expressing a sincere welcome to the group for traveling a long way to inspect the country. He also hoped that Shanghai and Taiwan would have more connections, mutual visits and inspections in the future to strengthen national unity. Subsequently, Weng Ling and Huang Chunqing delivered speeches, stating that they intended to use the gains from this inspection as a reference for the construction of a new Taiwan, and emphasized the compatriots' enthusiasm for loving the motherland.

At noon, they attended a joint banquet hosted by Mayor Wu and Speaker Pan at the Mayor's official residence on Anfu Road. In the afternoon, they continued to visit the Textile Construction Company, Jiaotong University and other places. At 7 pm, the Bank of Taiwan hosted a public banquet at the Fengze Building of the International Hotel, and they also visited the Central Daily News. The group is scheduled to leave Shanghai for Hangzhou tomorrow for sightseeing.</p>
<h3>Night Market for Pastries and Noodles Extended to 12 PM</h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] The City Council previously approved a joint petition from the Pastry and Dim Sum Industry Association and the Noodle Industry Association, requesting an extension of the night market business hours. The request was forwarded to the City Government and the Garrison Headquarters for handling. It is now known that the association has received a reply from the City Government, which stated that after a letter was sent to the Garrison Department, it was approved to extend the business hours to midnight.</p>
<h3>Maximum Speed Limit for Cars in the City is 30 Kilometers, Soliciting Passengers Prohibited on Main Roads for Non-Motorized Vehicles</h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] Recently, there have been continuous accidents involving military vehicles. According to police statistics, there were a total of 564 cases in March, of which 41 resulted in deaths or injuries. To prevent the recurrence of such incidents, the police bureau has now stipulated that the speed of cars in the city shall not exceed 30 kilometers, and in the suburbs shall not exceed 40 kilometers. The speed of trucks in the city shall not exceed 20 kilometers, and the maximum speed shall also be limited to 30 kilometers. As for roads with heavy traffic, all cars, military vehicles, and trucks are not allowed to overtake and drive first. In the urban areas, all main streets are also prohibited for non-motorized vehicles to solicit passengers along the way, in order to ensure safety. At the same time, the police bureau has printed a booklet and distributed it to traffic police, ordering them to prohibit idle chatter, smoking, reading newspapers, eating, or leaving their posts without permission during their duty hours. The time for opening and closing the red and green lights should be based on the traffic situation, with a principle of not exceeding one minute, in order to reconcile the excessive congestion of vehicles.</p>
<h3>Seventh Anniversary of Ping Zuren's Arrest, Monument Inscription Completed in Front of the Tomb</h3>

<h3>Fisheries Dispute Unresolved, Private Sector Representatives Raise Questions, Regarding the Fisheries Management Office's Administration as Improper</h3>
<p>Director of Fisheries Management Office Receives Reporters, Responds to Various Points Raised by the Fisheries Industry</p>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] The dispute between the Fisheries Rehabilitation Material Management Office and the private fisheries industry has been protracted for a long time and has not been resolved. Recently, the private fisheries sector has further dispatched representatives to Beijing to petition the National Assembly, and it is also heard that they will file a lawsuit against the Huai Management Office in accordance with the law. According to representatives of the private fisheries industry, the crux of this dispute lies in the fact that the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA) and the Chinese government initially had a basic agreement that all donated goods would be subject to a plan proposed by the Chinese government, and UNRRA would jointly purchase and transport them to China with Chinese representatives in accordance with the plan. The current Deputy Director of the Fisheries Management Office, Wang Yikang, was one of the fisheries technicians sent to UNRRA. All UNRRA's aid to China's fisheries materials were purchased by UNRRA experts, Mr. Messer, and Wang in accordance with the plan of the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry.</p>
<p>UNRRA Has No Right to Interfere</p>
<p>As for these materials, they are divided into two types: those used for rehabilitation are distributed to the people without compensation, and those used for relief are charged a reasonable fee, but the fees collected should still be used for the same department's rehabilitation undertakings. For example, shipbuilding timber belongs to the former, while fishing vessels have both rehabilitation and relief properties. The right to distribute these materials rests entirely with the administrative agencies; UNRRA has no right to interfere in the administration of the Fisheries Management Office, which belongs to the Chinese government, especially after the rehabilitation materials were released to the public. Now that UNRRA has ended its operations and has no representatives in Shanghai, the Fisheries Management Office often claims that everything is done in accordance with UNRRA's orders, and that the office has no right to distribute, which is indeed inappropriate.</p>
<p>Equipment is Left to Rot</p>
<p>Moreover, the office sells fishery supplies at high prices, and valuable machinery and fishing gear are left to rot. Fishing vessels are not allocated under the guise of supervision, making it even more difficult to shirk its responsibility. Last year, Chairman Shen of Zhejiang Province prepared funds and requested to receive timber to build fishing boats. The Farmers Bank automatically allocated 30 billion yuan the year before last, requesting to build ships. Last year, the Executive Yuan's Relief and Rehabilitation Administration automatically allocated 10,000 tons of flour to build ships for fishermen. However, the office transported more than 40,000 tons of timber to other ports and handed them over to branch offices for safekeeping. It neither built ships itself nor handed the timber over to local governments. All of the above facts have caused great impact to the private fisheries industry, so it resolutely raised public questions to the Fisheries Management Office.</p>
<p>On the other hand, Zhao Junmai, director of the Fisheries Management Office, held a special reception for reporters at the Licha Building at 5 pm yesterday, accompanied by Deputy Director Xia Yikang, the chief secretary, and the head of the material group, to answer the various points raised by the private fisheries industry and the questions asked by reporters.</p>
<p>Not a Single Piece of Timber is Moldy</p>
<p>(1) Types of materials and their handling: (A) Timber: A total of 25,000 tons arrived, worth more than 700,000 US dollars. In addition to the amount used and transported to Tianjin and other places, there are still more than 23,000 tons in storage, and not a single piece is moldy. As for building wooden boats, the sovereign right has indeed been transferred to our country, but initially there was a lack of funds, and it was planned to prepare funds from the Farmers Bank. However, UNRRA believed that it was not necessary and could be paid with American cotton funds. However, when requesting the collection of funds, both the Farmers Bank and the Executive Yuan reported their completion.</p>
<p>Sovereignty of Fishing Vessels Still Belongs to UNRRA</p>
<p>(B) Hemp Rope: Actually received 15,000 [units], more than 1,000 rolls were used in the past year, and more than 1,000 rolls were stored in Qingdao to be distributed to private fishermen. After investigation, it was confirmed that more than 2,000 rolls were moldy, but it was not the responsibility of the Fisheries Management Office. These hemp ropes were surplus materials from the US Navy. They had been stored for a long time before being transported to Shanghai, and mold had already occurred. Most of them were corroded by US military water to prevent them from being used by the enemy. After receiving them, the Fisheries Management Office stacked them in an open space because there was no warehouse to store them, but wooden boards were placed underneath, and double layers of canvas were laid on top, plus a bamboo shed. The best ones have now been picked out and placed in the warehouses of nearby merchants. As for the appearance of rotten ropes on the market, it may be that they were distributed to various units and fishing vessels and then leaked out. The Fisheries Management Office itself did not sell them. (C) A total of 126 motor vessels. Sixty ships will be sold (the method will be announced by the custody committee), twelve ships will be used for training drivers, fourteen ships are in Qingdao, ten ships are in Taiwan, and four ships are in Hainan Island. The Fisheries Management Office regularly uses about 25 ships, but the sovereignty of the fishing vessels is still in the hands of UNRRA to this day.</p>
<p>The Impact on the Private Sector is an Overstatement</p>
<p>(2) According to statistics from the fishing market, in the past year, all parties caught a total of 770,000 dan of fish, of which 550,000 dan were caught by private sailing ships, 150,000 dan were caught by motor vessels, and the Fisheries Management Office only caught 70,000 dan. Therefore, saying that the office affects the private sector is an overstatement. Moreover, the Fisheries Management Office often transports the fish caught to other ports. As for the Executive Yuan's previous stipulation that the fishing market should sell the fish of the Fisheries Management Office, it is said that at least 500,000 catties per month, not at most 500,000 catties. (3) Processing plan: Because the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry's Salted Fish Production and Marketing Committee has not yet been established, the Fisheries Management Office uses surplus fish to make salted fish itself, which is not illegal, and this work is actually a loss.</p>
<p>Treatment Issues</p>
<p>(4) Treatment issues: Foreign crew members used to receive a monthly salary of 900 US dollars, which was based on the contract between UNRRA and our country. At the same time, they would also receive 40% of the fishing income as a subsidy each time. Since the contract was cancelled in April, the above 40% subsidy has been stopped. Chinese crew members can earn up to 50 million yuan in March and at least about 6 million yuan, with bonuses as high as more than 20 million yuan and as low as 3 million yuan. A profit-sharing system has recently been implemented, and no salaries are given.</p>
<p>Regarding Director Zhao's private residence in a foreign-style house, the chief secretary explained that it is the same courtyard as the office staff. It was approved by Deputy Director Wang after consideration that Director Zhao lives in a single house because of his large family, while other staff members live in a single house with several families.</p>
<h3>Serious Stage of Municipal Finance, Salaries Will Reach 400 Billion</h3>
<p>Director of the Bureau of Finance, Tian Yong stated to reporters: "Due to the impact of prices and the cost of living index, the city's finances have entered a serious stage. The total revenue of the city's finances last month was approximately 326.5 billion yuan, while the total expenditure was 328 billion yuan, so it is already insufficient. Among them, the salaries of the employees of the city's bureaus account for approximately 130 billion yuan. If the recently disclosed adjustment in the treatment of public teachers and staff is followed, and the new index is 245,000 times, the salaries of only the staff and police will reach 390 billion yuan. This amount exceeds the city's total monthly revenue by more than 60 billion yuan, and other business expenditures will be even more uncertain. Therefore, the future of local finance is difficult to be optimistic."</p>
<h3>Policeman Beaten While Arresting Someone, Knitwear Factory Workers Cause a Riot</h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] When the workers of the Zhongfang First Knitwear Factory on Yangchang Road in eastern Shanghai were dismissed from work at 6 pm on the 7th, a female worker, Wang Cailan, was followed and teased by a male worker from the same factory, Yu Xifu. When they reached the east end of Si Road, Wang rebuked him several times. Yu became angry and gathered a crowd to beat her and then fled. Afterwards, Wang reported the incident to the Maqiao Police Station, which sent police to arrest the culprit but failed. At about 6 pm yesterday, the Xinshi Street Branch continued to send employee Sun Zhijian to lead four plainclothes police officers to wait at the factory gate. Before long, Yu followed the crowd out and was arrested by Sun and others.

<h3>Fallen Youth Confesses: Extravagant Spending on Pleasure, Arrested for Obtaining Money Under False Pretenses</h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] At about 9 am yesterday, a young man, dressed in a Western suit and leather shoes, suddenly arrived at the office of the 34th Bao of the Zhujia Ku District of the Jing'an District, holding a Shanghai Good People's Voluntary Hospital fundraising booklet. He met with staff member Bian Yifeng and claimed that he had obtained permission from the municipal government to go out and raise funds for the hospital's foundation. When Bian asked to see the documents of permit and official documents, the young man attempted to escape after hearing the words. Bian followed and chased him out, immediately calling the police officer No. 706 of the Jing'an Temple Police Branch, who took him to the bureau for interrogation. According to his confession, his name is Shao Shuping, using the alias Li Huimin, 24 years old, from Ningbo, living at No. 12, Rencheng Lane, Shaonian Road, Xiaoximen. He also claimed to be the director of the Shanghai Good People's Voluntary Hospital at No. 65, Huining Road, and also the manager of the Pingping Scientific Testing Factory. However, there were many flaws in his confession. Director Yu, sensing that he was not a good person, immediately sent police officers to Huining Road in the Nanshi District to investigate the hospital, but ultimately failed to find it. They then returned to his home in Rencheng Lane, Shaonian Road, and found nine donation books for the fictitious hospital, several seals of the military defense, a Chunmao Qianzhuang checkbook, and a remittance book. There was also a love letter written by Zhang Ping, a dancer at the Xin Dahua Dance Hall. The suspect then bowed his head in silence, admitting that he was using the name of the hospital to make money to live on. Since February 15, he had raised 150 million yuan, averaging 3 million yuan per day. There were also two accomplices, Xu Lisheng and Mao Dongsheng, who were both at large. He continued to confess that at about 2 pm the day before yesterday, he went to the Hongxiang Courtyard brothel in Baokang Lane, Zhongzheng Middle Road, and paid 1.2 million yuan to invite the prostitute Hua Yuanyuan to watch a movie. He then went to the Xin Dahua Stage to dance. After dinner, he went to the Daguangming Cinema to watch a movie and finally went to the Mainland Hotel to stay in room 501, spending a total of more than 4 million yuan. By yesterday morning, because he had no money to use, he broke up with Hua Yuanyuan and went to the above-mentioned location to solicit donations, where he was discovered and arrested. He also confessed that he had committed the same crime in August last year and had been imprisoned for four months. Subsequently, the branch bureau summoned the prostitute Hua Yuanyuan and Zhang Ping, a dancer at the Xin Dahua Dance Hall at No. 566, Fuxing Middle Road, to the bureau. Hua Yuanyuan's confession was the same as Shao's, but Zhang Ping confessed that she had met Shao in June or July last year while dancing. According to Shao's claim, he was the manager of the Pingping Scientific Testing Factory, spending money like water, and a relationship developed over time. As for the love letter, it was indeed [written by her]. Later, Shao was sentenced to prison. Knowing that he was not a good person, her feelings gradually faded, and she no longer visited him often. After the investigation was completed, the branch bureau ordered the two women to return and sent the case to the local procuratorate for prosecution on charges of fraud.</p>

<h3>Demanding Old Debts, Denounced, Fake Chief Accountant of the Ministry of Finance, Ren Zhongdao Throws Himself Into the Net</h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] Ren Zhongdao, the son-in-law of Zhao Zunyue, the false secretary general of the false municipal government, and the false chief accountant of the Ministry of Finance, who was wanted, has been arrested by the District Procuratorate and transferred to the High Procuratorate for legal proceedings yesterday morning. The process of Ren's arrest was as follows: The Lao Zhengxing Restaurant at No. 250, Guangxi Road was opened by Han Chinese suspect Xiao Qian during the enemy puppet period. After the victory, Xiao fled, and Xiao's brother-in-law, Guo Jinsheng, was responsible for the store's affairs. At the end of last year, the losses were quite large, and it was impossible to open the market for the New Year. Therefore, the partners elected Zheng Wenbo as the manager. Last month, Zheng received a call from Ren Zuyu, claiming that Xiao Gang had owed Ren Zhongdao money and that the District Court had ruled that Xiao should return the debt, otherwise the court would execute the seizure of the restaurant. Entrusted Guo Jinshan to contact Ren, and Ren asked for 16 million yuan. They agreed to pay 4 million yuan first, and Ren took out a note from Ren Zhongdao, with the seal already affixed. Zheng Wenbo discovered that it was forged, so he twisted Ren Zuyu to the police station and transferred him to the District Procuratorate for detention. Prosecutor He Huimin issued a summons to Ren Zhongdao to appear in court for confrontation. At this time, someone secretly reported that Ren Zhongdao had been wanted for suspicion of being a traitor.

<h3>Implementation Measures for Limiting Bill Offsets: Four More Instructions from the Ministry of Finance</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] Regarding the offsetting of bills from banks and financial institutions, the Financial Management Bureau recently obtained four instructions from the Ministry of Finance: (1) Regarding the request to allow bank drafts and remittance receipts to be used for offsetting in accordance with promissory notes and certified checks, it has been verified that it is feasible and permission is granted. (2) It is not appropriate to discuss allowing banks and financial institutions to sign contracts for offsetting with new rice merchants based on their creditworthiness, as it goes against the original intent of the promulgated measures. (3) The request to extend the deadline for banks and financial institutions to report on the implementation of bill offsetting contracts with their customers by one month to April 15th should be approved. (4) The proposal for banks and financial institutions to use customer collection bill guarantees to replace contracts is feasible; however, the clause in the original guarantee form stating that the bank or financial institution has the right to terminate or reduce the offsetting amount at any time should be deleted to prevent abuses. In the future, banks and financial institutions must sign new contracts when reducing the offsetting amount for customers. When stopping the offsetting for customers, the original contract should be strictly terminated. Banks and financial institutions should report to the Financial Management Bureau and the bill exchange of the Central Bank for record-keeping in advance when reducing or terminating the offsetting amount for customers, and may not dishonor checks on the grounds that the collection amount has not been received or for other similar reasons.</p>
<h3>The Trend Does Not Escape a State of Fatigue: Trading in Chinese Stocks is Desolate</h3>
<p>Yesterday, new short positions on Chinese stocks continued to increase, and the trend did not escape a state of fatigue. Hong Kong telecom stocks contracted, and the Guangdong faction supplemented short positions, but still rebounded after falling. Crackdowns are being intensified, and trading is pitifully small, with no upward momentum for the time being.</p>
<p>When the market opened in the morning, the atmosphere was languid. Wing On Silk opened at 1870 yuan, and the rise and fall of each stock was minimal. After the opening, trading was sparse. No. 76 and others closed their positions, falling back to 1835 yuan. Although No. 220 and others bought in, and the Guangdong faction also supplemented, rising to 1850 yuan, No. 54 and others closed many positions, falling back to 1838 yuan. No. 16 and others supplemented their positions, and the money exchange faction absorbed them, rising to 1860 yuan midway. Mr. Zheng sold secretly, and the situation in the market became even more desolate. After No. 131 and others supplied, it fell back to a low price of 1820 yuan near noon. The Guangdong faction, the silk flower faction, the money exchange industry, etc., maintained the market. The market closed at 1828 yuan at noon. Compared with the previous close, China United was still flat, while Heng Feng, Wing On Silk, China Cement, and Datong experienced slight setbacks. China-France, Xinhe, Dongxing, Wing On Public, Tongyi, Rongfeng, Jinglun, Match, Li'an, China Silk, National Goods, Commerce, Xinhua, and Zhabei each fell by half a percent.</p>
<p>The afternoon market still followed the old path. Wing On Silk was at 1850 yuan. Starting from 1855 yuan, No. 105 and others sold, falling to 1830 yuan. The Guangdong faction took advantage of the low price to buy and then hovered. No. 145 and others also entered, rising to a high price of 1865 yuan. No. 61 and others sold, and the national bank made a difference, over 200 billion, falling to a low price of 1815 yuan. Hong Kong telecom stocks contracted to 8 jiao 6 fen and a half. No. 149 and others came to maintain the market again, and the market closed at 1835 yuan. After the close, No. 145 and others bought in succession, rising again to around 1845 yuan. As a result, compared with the morning close, Zhabei was flat, while Wing On Silk, Xinhe, China-France, Xinhua, Qinxing, Tongyi, Rongfeng, China Silk, Jinglun, and Commerce rose slightly, and the rest all fell slightly. Unlisted stocks outside the market still appeared weak, with only Xinxin remaining stable.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] The Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Economic Affairs recently issued six measures for the listing of new stocks for capital increases. According to the last provision, the stocks of each company are temporarily suspended from listing during the capital increase procedures, and the delay is quite lengthy, which affects the listed stock companies, securities brokers, etc. Therefore, the Securities Exchange specifically suggested to the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Economic Affairs a method for trading old stocks with rights, in order to remedy this. It is learned that the above-mentioned method has been approved by the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Economic Affairs yesterday, and the Securities Exchange immediately sent letters to each listed stock company for reference.</p>
<h3>Unified Bonds and Foreign Stocks Are Flat and Weak</h3>

<p>Yesterday, foreign stocks, rubber stocks, and Yieh United experienced significant declines. Hot stocks included Hong Kong telecom stocks contracting but still rebounding after falling, with the Guangdong faction and the physical coupon faction exiting and then entering. Jardine Silk opened at 2.44 million, falling to around 2.37 million midway, and finally saw a slight rebound. Compared to the previous close, Jardine Matheson was flat, while Yieh United and Jardine United fell by half a percent, Blue Grid fell by a little over ten percent, and the rest all experienced slight setbacks.

<h3>Tin Prices Fall Again, People's Hearts are Timid: Rice Continues to Decline: Flour's Decline is Very Strong, the Oil Market is Weak</h3>
<p>Yesterday's rice market opened in the morning with tin prices falling again, making people's hearts even more timid. Merchants saw no improvement in the market and sought to sell one after another, so prices fell again by 100,000 yuan. White japonica rice was 3.65 million in the South City market, and 3.75 million in the North City market. Midway, due to the low price, the outflow became active, and the market stopped declining and rose, with the afternoon market rebounding by 50,000 yuan. As a result, it fell by 50,000 to 100,000 yuan compared to the previous day. Indica rice was firm and popular because the price in other regions was high and the inventory was scarce. Unpolished indica rice and rough indica rice showed slight gains. The South City market's Yinbai Yuan still stood at the original price. The total arrival of goods yesterday was 3,640 stones.</p>
<p>Flour</p>
<p>Yesterday, the market's decline intensified. It was heard that American flour had arrived, and people's hearts were extremely timid. Merchants competed to sell, but customers remained unmoved, so prices plummeted. Navy ship flour opened at 1.39 million, and later fell to 1.365 million yuan. Old car flour, etc., uniformly fell by 65,000. Bran wanted to rise but instead fell, and finally returned to a low of 30,000. The wheat mill price was reduced to 2.1 million minus 50,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Miscellaneous Grains</p>
<p>Firm and strong. The Shantou faction chose high-quality goods for soybeans, and the market was able to maintain its stability. The corn market was flat, but the outflow was still active. Red sorghum was stable. Mung beans had sales in both the North and South factions, rising by 100,000 yuan. Sesame was targeted again by the Tianjin faction, continuing to rise by 200,000 or 300,000.

<p>Edible Oil</p>
<p>Hovering in a weak state. The sales of raw oil were sluggish, and transactions were sparse. The last price of Dayou soybean oil was 8.1 million yuan, similar to yesterday. Customers stopped absorbing soybean cakes, and retail investors frequently sold, falling by 40,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Also, it is reported that the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Haiyu transport ship loaded 8,700 tons of rice from Yangon this time and set off on the (12th) the day before yesterday to return to Shanghai, which is expected to arrive in Shanghai at the end of this month.

<h3>Customer Absorption is Still Sluggish: Manufactured Silk Continues to Fall: Factory Management Stabilizes Silk Goods</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the situation of manufactured silk cloth continued to fall. Because the absorption of this street and customers is still sluggish, and the absorption power of practical factories is also weak, it is therefore difficult to revive. In the morning, No. 120 Tianqiao opened at 230 million yuan. Afterwards, outsiders absorbed it in small amounts, and it began to rebound. It finally closed at 233.3 million yuan, down another 2 million. Dongyang and Gaoshan, etc., also continued to fall by about 2 million.</p>
<p>The silk market tended to stabilize, matching yesterday's market, with sparse transactions and a languid atmosphere. In the morning, CD grades were still calling for 36.5 million yuan. At noon, 5 dan of open-mouth goods were traded, priced at 35.5 million yuan. Gan Jing, from Zhili, rebounded, and at noon, 5 dan of the top 18 points were made, transporting 31 million yuan.</p>
<p>The silk fabric market continued to fall yesterday. In the morning, Dachen quilted fabric was made for 140.2 million yuan. There was absorption at lower prices, and it once rose to 141.5 million yuan. In the end, due to the sluggish stock market, it softened near the close, with the current price being 141 million yuan, a 2.4 million yuan decline. Fengchou followed suit, falling by 10,000 yuan. Transactions were quite active, and the rest mostly stood firm.</p>
<h3>Customer Absorption is Weak: The Yarn Market Generally Softens: Cotton Cloth Has Abundant Chips and Prices are Also Reduced</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the yarn market showed a stagnant situation. The absorption of customers was still sluggish, and this street also took a wait-and-see attitude, resulting in sparse transactions. The initial opening price of 42-count Blue Phoenix hovered at the closing price of the previous day. Later, it was rumored that the authorities were investigating the account books of yarn dealers, and people's hearts softened at one point, once making 228 million yuan. However, the reproduction industry saw gains at low prices, and the market slightly rose near the close, finally closing at 233 million yuan, up another 3 million. 42-count Bingguang and Shuiyue both rebounded firmly by 2 million. 21-count Double Horse opened at 145 million yuan. Although the table-side gang hyped it up, once seeing 247 million yuan, the pressure from the short side was heavier, and it finally fell back, closing at the opening price, down 5 million. The digestion of each grade of 42-count yarn varied, with mixed results. Each grade of 61-count yarn tended to be sluggish, with a general decline of 2 million to 3.5 million yuan.</p>
<p>Yesterday, in the cotton cloth market, Tianjin customers had sales, dye factories had sluggish absorption, and although retail investors entered and exited frequently, they were purely buying low and selling high. Furthermore, because the street merchants turned into the off-season, the absorption was even scarcer. The allocation of textiles for construction was abundant, resulting in 12-pound Longtou fine cloth opening at 4.84 million, gradually falling to 4.76 million yuan. Then, retail investors absorbed it at lower prices, rebounding to 4.78 million yuan at the close.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Textile Construction Company supplied 4.48 million yuan for La Batong fine cloth, 4.53 million yuan for Sijunzi Yuan Biji, and 5.35 million yuan for Sijunzi Yuan Fujiu, and few people applied.</p>

<h3>The Fuel Management Committee Enriches Coal Reserves: 180,000 Tons Shipped Monthly</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] According to the person in charge of the Fuel Management Committee, they have recently reached an agreement with China Merchants Steam Navigation Company to ship 180,000 tons of coal feet monthly. The bureau is responsible for allocating ships to transport any shortfall to Shanghai. The amount of coal feet that has arrived at the port this month includes more than 40,000 tons from Qinhuangdao and more than 10,000 tons from Taiwan, totaling approximately 50,000 tons. No coal was transported from East China and Huainan. The quantity of coal allocated to private factories in the city is determined to be 20,000 tons, and 3,500 tons for civilian use. The distribution and sale will begin on the 15th of this month. Regarding the foreign coal portion, 7.548 tons of white coal purchased from the Soviet Union for the production of coal briquettes has recently arrived, but there has been no arrival of bituminous coal.</p>
<h3>Foreign Trade in Tea is Sparse</h3>
<p>Yesterday, tea merchants felt that the inventory was still scarce, and because tea workers were expected to continue to increase, they were unwilling to loosen their hold on the goods in their hands. However, the domestic sales of tea were considered too expensive by this street and the customers, and they adopted a negative attitude. Regarding the foreign trade of various types of tea, exporters were also sorting out the goods that had been prepared in recent days in order to quickly load them for North Africa, so the buying momentum was weak and the process was both sparse, making it difficult for transactions to become active. However, the underlying potential remained firm, with no downward trend.</p>
<p>Also, according to the tea industry, the tea season is approaching, and the Mao tea in the production areas of Zhejiang, Jiangxi, and Anhui are entering the development period, and will soon be produced one after another. However, this year, due to the abnormal weather and the lack of mild climate, and the impact of soaring prices of all things, the tea body is not as fresh and tender as last year, and the price is expected to be surprisingly high. Looking at this situation, it is still uncertain whether the actual sales will be smooth.</p>
<h3>Textile Factories are Moving to Hong Kong and Guangdong: The Flower Management Committee Says it Has Not Heard of It</h3>
<p>The Sino-Economic Society reporter recently visited the person in charge of the Flower and Yarn Cloth Management Committee to inquire about several important issues that are currently attracting attention regarding the management of flower, yarn, and cloth. The conversation was as follows: Question: How many factories have exchanged cotton for yarn during the trial period of spinning and weaving on behalf of your committee? Answer: 36 factories, including Dafeng, have applied to exchange cotton for yarn. 7 factories, including Zhaofeng, have signed contracts. 8 factories, including Yongmin, have been asked to come to the committee to sign contracts. 2 factories, including Datong, are in the process of handling. 19 factories, including Xinyu, are still under investigation. Question: As of now, how much raw cotton has your committee entrusted to China Textile, Agricultural Bank, and other institutions to purchase, and how much is in stock in Shanghai? Approximately how many numbers do you have? Answer: (1) China Textile purchased more than 200,000 bales on behalf of the committee, (2) China Agricultural Bank purchased more than 80,000 bales on behalf of the committee, (3) Cotton Union purchased more than 16,000 to 17,000 rejections on behalf of the committee, (4) Self-purchased more than 20,000 bales, (5) The Foreign Sales Committee transferred 14,000 dan of Indian cotton to our committee. The total amount that has arrived in Shanghai warehouses is approximately 160,000 dan. Question: The relocation of textile factories to Hong Kong is of great concern to all parties. What is the attitude of your committee? Answer: We have not heard of the relocation of textile factories to Hong Kong. However, what we know is that the yarn ends that some factories have ordered from foreign countries have arrived in Hong Kong, but they have not been shipped to Shanghai immediately, which is a fact. There may be talk of building factories locally, but it may not be possible. The reasons are: (1) The climate in Hong Kong is not suitable for spinning, (2) The land price in Hong Kong is extremely high, so how can it be easy to build a factory.</p>
<p>[Another Report] According to an authority in the industrial sector, the economy in South China is stable, the region is peaceful, it is easier to purchase raw materials, there are fewer regulatory agencies, and production efficiency can be increased several times compared to Shanghai. It is learned that 700 tons of textile machines from the Shenxin Factory in this city have already been transported to Guangzhou for installation yesterday. They plan to establish a new factory there to develop the business. It is also learned that the machines ordered from the United States by several emerging factories in this city were originally scheduled to be transported to this city for installation, but it is now heard that the machines have also been directly transported to Guangzhou for unloading.</p>

<h3>Social Mores and the Human Heart</h3>
<p>— Wu Yong</p>
<p>When external circumstances undergo turmoil, the inner human nature will naturally also change. During wartime, human nature is like a bottle of liquid containing sediment. After violent shaking, the unclean substances originally at the bottom rise to the top. Human nature is just like this, agitated by war, its worst aspects, which were originally latent and static, are now released. Human nature is like a bottle of pure calcium hydrate, and war is like sulfuric acid, a coagulant. Adding this coagulant to the calcium hydrate promotes robbery, rape, hoarding, speculation, murder, arson, and other unclean sediments of human nature. After such a dramatic change, human civilization is temporarily pushed back thousands of years. In wartime, most people adhere to the laws of the barbaric era: everyone for themselves, and the words of the stronger are justice. Even when peace arrives, order is difficult to restore immediately. The scum floating on top will not easily settle to the bottom for a long time.</p>
<p>The deterioration of human nature and the worrying state of social mores during wartime are, of course, facts. Therefore, some people who witness this are heartbroken and believe that the situation is getting worse and worse, giving rise to a sense that "each generation is worse than the last." Some even indulge in ancient sentiments, constantly yearning for "the good old days," with some meaning of recalling the past, restoring the old ways, and returning to simplicity. The catchphrase of this type of person is two sentences: "Social mores are deteriorating daily" and "People's hearts are not what they used to be." If these words express the speaker's dissatisfaction with the current state, indicating anxiety about the lack of improvement in the environment, then not only is it human nature and understandable, but it is also a manifestation of a healthy mind and the prelude to social improvement, and we should sympathize with them.</p>
<p>However, I firmly believe that the evolution of society is gradual. Although the evolution is slow, it is undoubtedly progressing forward at all times. At a certain period, we may feel that the evolution of society has entered a state of stagnation, or even a temporary reversal, but at worst, it is only as bad as it used to be. Even considering the situation during past wars, we only need to check history to know that there have been cruel and chaotic examples in the past. Therefore, the saying "Social mores are deteriorating daily" is not appropriate when compared to historical facts.</p>
<p>People of all generations have always thought that ancient times were so good and that the current situation is so bad. In fact, this is due to a psychological illusion because, in the eyes of most people, things near to reality are always inevitably flawed, while things that cannot be obtained or seen are often imagined to be better than they actually are. For example, people of all generations have always praised Yao and Shun endlessly and slandered Jie and Zhou, but Confucius said: "The evil of Zhou was not as great as that." Then, conversely, we can infer that the virtue of Yao and Shun was not as holy as praised.</p>
<p>The psychological background of the saying "Social mores are deteriorating daily" is simply the four words "venerating the past and belittling the present." It should be known that although today's environment has many things that are not ideal, it is not as if the entire present world is the eighteenth level of hell, just as ancient times were not necessarily a paradise high in the clouds. Wang Chong said it well: "The scholars of the past and the scholars of the present are the same, both containing the nature of benevolence and righteousness. Therefore, their encounters will all have moments of dedication. There were unrighteous people in ancient times, and there are righteous people in the present. Good and evil are mixed together, which age does not have them? Those who recount events like to elevate the ancient and demean the present, valuing what is heard and belittling what is seen. Debaters then talk about what is old, and writers then write about what is distant. There are wonders near that the debaters do not mention, and there are differences in the present that the pen does not record."</p>
<p>Chinese people seem to be particularly fond of the past. For example, preserving national treasures, admiring antiques, and painters who like to paint ancient figures are all manifestations of a love of the past. This excessive habit of loving the past may be one of the reasons hindering progress. In summary, my conclusion is: social mores are not deteriorating daily, and people's hearts should not be ancient.</p>
<h3>Talking About Eating Noodles After Returning from Hangzhou</h3>
<p>— Chen Yixian</p>
<p>The popularity of spring travel to Hangzhou this year is unprecedented. It is reported that the Kuiyuan Restaurant noodle shop uses more than one dan of eel a day. Kuiyuan Restaurant is famous for its shrimp and fried eel noodles. Yellow eel is most plump in late spring and early summer, which is now in season. The day before Children's Day, I and my wife took my granddaughter to Hangzhou for a short three-day stay. I did not go to Kuiyuan Restaurant, but I still ate noodles twice. One time was at Jushui Restaurant in Baoyoufang. Its shrimp and fried eel costs 160,000 yuan a bowl, the same price as Kuiyuan Restaurant. The noodles are light and wide, the raw ingredients are fried in oil, and the toppings are generous. According to friends, its taste is above Kuiyuan, and it is a new shop opened in recent years. The other time was at Jusheng Restaurant in Fengqiao Lane. I lived in Hangzhou for twenty years before July 7th and often went to this shop to eat noodles with two or three friends. It is the oldest noodle shop in Hangzhou, and its 100th anniversary was last year. The owner's surname is Weng. This time I went to eat, and I ordered half-soup noodles. I mentioned the past to the shop assistant, and the noodles were indeed good, because the owner heard that I was an old patron from ten years ago and was particularly attentive. Shanghai people who travel to Hangzhou only know Kuiyuan Restaurant, but they do not know the newly opened Jushui and the century-old Jusheng. I wrote this article to inform future travelers.</p>
<p>Ballpoint Pens Are Not Worth Using</p>
<p>In Chongqing, just after the victory, several auction houses were already displaying some ballpoint pens, with prices quite expensive, requiring 250,000 yuan a pen, equivalent to the price of one tael of gold at the time. Everyone could only look at it with curiosity, wondering how adding ink once could allow it to be used continuously for several years, which was inexplicable.</p>
<p>Later, after returning to my hometown - Shanghai - to visit several relatives whom I had not seen for nine years, I took some silver from Chengdu and dangshen from Chongqing to send to them. They sent me a jade-colored ballpoint pen, which was worth about 40,000 to 50,000 yuan at the time. I felt it was too expensive, but due to their kindness, I had to accept it. So I began to study its structure. It turned out that there was a tiny steel ball on its tip, smaller than one-thousandth of the pen tube. When writing, the steel ball rubbed against the paper surface and thus rotated, and the ink in the pen tube adhered to the surface of the steel ball and was printed on the paper, thus writing the words. At that time, if you had a ballpoint pen, you would immediately feel your value tenfold, and everyone would look at you with admiration. But after using it for a short time, it often failed to write. The instructions told you to blow into a small hole at the end of the pen, so that ink could come out, hoping to use air pressure to squeeze the ink down, but the result was sometimes effective and sometimes ineffective. The reason why it could not write was probably due to the paper. When writing on ordinary paper, the fine hairs on the paper would follow the rotation of the steel ball and enter the tube, thus hindering the movement of the steel ball and preventing it from writing. Later, the ink in the pen not only did not come out of the tip, but squeezed out of the small hole at the end of the pen, even if the small hole was plugged, it was useless, and the pockets were covered in ink stains. Once, due to the large expansion and contraction of heat, the steel ball flowed out along with the ink, making a mess. It was difficult to find it in the ink for a long time before finally finding the steel ball and inserting it into the pen tube. From then on, I put it aside and did not use it, to avoid further trouble.</p>
<p>Several of my friends who had ballpoint pens either could not write with them or had the steel ball flow out. My relative who gave me the pen also had the steel ball of his pen flow out, causing a new long gown to be completely covered in ink stains, and his hands were also stained with ink, which could not be washed off. This was simply not a ballpoint pen, but a disaster pen. I think those who have used the Renault ballpoint pen all had curiosity at first and were intimate with it, but in the end, they all discarded it aside, hating it to the bone, because it not only cost money, but was also not practical and caused trouble. The number of these pens in the hands of our people should not be small, cheating us out of our money, which is considerable. Shanghai people say: Tricky business, as long as everyone is tricked once, he can make a fortune. My personal loss is a small matter, but I hope that everyone will never be tricked by Renault again!</p>
<h3>Philately</h3>
<p>— Hongxian</p>
<p>Many friends like to collect stamps, and many regard rare foreign stamps as treasures. In fact, Chinese stamps are the most valuable stamps in the world. There are three reasons why they are so valuable, and I will list them for the reference of philatelists. First: The face value of Chinese stamps is astonishing, ranging from half a cent to one hundred yuan. This is probably the face value of stamps in various countries in the world, but we in China have stamps priced at one thousand to ten thousand, or even one hundred thousand, and perhaps even millions. These astronomical prices are one of the characteristics of preciousness.</p>
<p>Second: There are many types of Chinese stamps. Almost every year, new patterns are issued, and there are stamps limited to certain places and stamps changed to a certain amount of money. The large differences can also be listed as treasures.</p>
<p>Third: The paper and ink used in Chinese stamps often have blurry defects. These defects are often appreciated by philatelists. Look at the same version of stamps, and their colors often vary greatly, which can be used for the verification of curious people.</p>
<p>I remember that there are countries in the world that use stamps as financial revenue. If China could sell complex, novel, and large-denomination stamps in the world stamp market, it would definitely be profitable. It has not yet been done, which is truly a pity.</p>
<h3>Not Music?</h3>
<p>— You Ting</p>
<p>Mozi opposed music, saying: "The people have three worries: the hungry cannot eat, the cold cannot be clothed, and the tired cannot rest... To make music is wrong."</p>
<p>This logic of Mo Di can be refuted with four words: "refraining from eating for fear of choking." However, looking at the quiet passing of this year's National Music Festival (April 5th), without even a record concert, it can be seen that the cultural authorities who created this festival may be well-versed in Mozi's words and unwilling to provide the people with music amidst the war.</p>
<p>However, some things are unbearable: In Shanghai, there is an atmosphere of singing and dancing in the tall buildings, "music" is everywhere. Turn on the radio, and there is a continuous stream of songs: "My dear, my nemesis!"—those "music" with the most clumsy techniques and the most lascivious content.</p>
<p>After the songs of "China Night" and "Manchurian Girl" stopped, what fills the ears of the citizens is still mainly low-grade emotional sound scores. In such a situation, even a music festival is too stingy to embellish, what more can be said? Not willing to advocate, not willing to educate the people, how can the people's taste not be low.</p>
<p>It is the friendly nations who are anxious for us. The United States Information Service recently, in addition to its bi-weekly record music appreciation meetings, also holds special concerts every week (both with free admission), doing some social music education work for this huge Shanghai. Although the effect is limited, at least students, civil servants, and working youth can benefit.</p>
<p>Recently, the Wing Wo Industrial Company has also been broadcasting symphonic and other classical music every weekend on the Greater Shanghai and Chinese-American radio stations, introducing the outline of modern music to everyone and raising the general level of appreciation. Even if this is advertising in nature, its meaning and effect are worthy of gratitude! Moreover, standing on the position of commercial advertising, and being able to incidentally sow some seeds of art in Shanghai, a large city in the East, so that this smog-filled space can still retain some white parts, so that the masses can also have a moment of cultivation and rest; we hope that someone will follow the example of this industrial company's pioneering initiative.</p>
<p>At the same time, we do not believe that the cultural authorities with the responsibility of leadership really think that there is no need to talk about music at present, at least for the next generation, it is not appropriate to do so!</p>
<h3>Under the Cherry Blossoms</h3>
<p>— He Tianjian</p>
<p>Participating in a cherry blossom viewing party, sitting under the cherry blossom trees, I couldn't help but feel all sorts of emotions. I composed two poems to show to my countrymen. If I may be so bold as to request harmonizing verses from others, please mail them to me at No. 1283 Fuxing Road, this city.</p>
<p>It doesn't matter that the flowers bloom in a foreign land, today the east wind is shared by one family. Looking out, we must be as broad as heaven and earth, with what intention can we treat things as different from ourselves! In spring, thousands of layers of snow in the garden, the wind moves the branches, ten thousand pieces of rosy clouds, sitting for a long time, how do I know when people have dispersed, I raise my head and suddenly hear half a crow's cry.</p>
<p>The sound of war drums moves the earth, yet I still leisurely look, the people bring happy hearts to see for half a day, the flowers should be more timid than Xishi towards Yue (I hope the countrymen pay attention to this sentence), I often think of the Eastern Jin and expect peace (name of a person); lingering, how many generations pity the urgency of spring, I shake off my emotions and laugh that I have exhausted them, a month ago under the plum trees, my bowels twisted nine times, nine times sour!</p>
<h3>Anecdotes of Coolidge</h3>
<p>— Leng Leng</p>
<p>President Coolidge of the United States had a female secretary. Because she often made mistakes in punctuation, Coolidge wanted to find a way to correct her mistakes, but he did not directly blame her; he first praised her in an admiring tone:</p>
<p>"I think your appearance and dress are very beautiful, and you are also very capable in doing things. You are truly a perfect girl."</p>
<p>The female secretary was flattered, her face shy and coy, and her heart was unusually happy.</p>
<p>Coolidge then smiled and said:</p>
<p>"Don't be shy, a beautiful and capable girl is worthy of being praised."</p>
<p>He walked over and stood next to the female secretary's typewriter.</p>
<p>"Oh! Are you typing the record of my conversation with reporters yesterday? It's about..." He deliberately leaned closer to look at the typewriter.</p>
<p>"What? Is there something wrong with the lead letters on the typewriter keyboard? Look, the punctuation marks are always wrong, let me try it."</p>
<p>Secretary Ann hurriedly got up and offered her seat. Coolidge sat down and tried typing carefully, then stood up and said to her:</p>
<p>"There's nothing wrong, but just pay a little attention when typing punctuation marks. Try it yourself again."</p>
<p>The female secretary had already understood Coolidge's intention and felt ashamed in her heart; afterwards, she not only did not make mistakes in punctuation but also typed unusually accurately and quickly. This is of course due to Coolidge's understatement, which made her aware of her mistakes and improve.</p>
<h3>Errors in Language Usage</h3>
<p>— Jie Xian</p>
<p>"Wen Zhi Bin Bin" (The Analects of Confucius, Yong Ye): "When the substance exceeds the form, you get rustic simplicity; when the form exceeds the substance, you get a scribe. Only when the form and substance are in harmonious balance, you get a gentleman." Bao's commentary: "Bin Bin means that the form and substance are half and half." According to this, "form" refers to external expression, and "substance" refers to inner content, both of which are metaphors for a person's character. Nowadays, describing a person as refined and courteous is "Wen Zhi Bin Bin," and even describing behavior as "Bin Bin Ran" or "Bin Bin You Li" seems inappropriate.</p>
<p>"Qu Xiao" (to make fun of), popularly refers to teasing someone. However, "Qu Xiao" actually means inviting ridicule from others. In the Biography of the Family Servants in the History of the Five Dynasties: "Writing is not something one can master without practice; spreading it by word of mouth only invites ridicule." The current interpretation of the term is the opposite of its original meaning.</p>
<p>"Yi Chang San Tan" (One Sings and Three Sigh): In the Record of Music: "One sings and three sigh, there will be lingering sounds." Commentary: "Chang means initiating a song phrase; San Tan means three people sighing along." It means one person sings and three people harmonize. Nowadays, "Yi Chang San Tan" is used as a metaphor for the lingering, profound, and touching emotions of writing, which is also inconsistent with the original meaning.</p>
<p>"Zhi Shi" (Executive): Someone who serves others by providing service for their use. In the Guoyu, Yueyu, the official Wen Zhong of Yue used Wu to replace Goujian to give a speech: "...daring not to make a sound to the king, privately to the lower executives said..." Zuo Zhuan: "Make lower officials reward the executives," the former shows that Goujian dared not compete with the King of Wu, so he called them "Executives," the latter clearly refers to those who provide service. Today, people often refer to the other party as "Zhi Shi" in letters, which is very disrespectful. Some say that the reason for calling "Zhi Shi" is a humble way of not directly referring to the person, but this is also quite far-fetched.</p>
<p>"Wei Suo" (trivial): Sima Xiangru's biography in the Records of the Grand Historian: "Moreover, when a wise ruler ascends the throne, is it merely a matter of trivial grasping, being restricted by written rules and customs, following and reciting what has been passed down, and simply trying to please the world?" (Difficult to the elders of Shu) Suo Yin: "Wei Suo means petty and fragmented." In modern times, "Wei Suo" is often used as a metaphor for a person's vulgar appearance and behavior, which is actually not the original meaning.</p>
<p>"Guan Si" (lawsuit): Originally meant all officials. Zuo Zhuan: "Preparing objects and documents, officials managing ceremonial vessels;" also "The duties of the servants and the guards of the officials are not matters for the ruler." Nowadays, the matter of litigation is called "Guan Si," and the act of litigating is called "Da Guan Si" (to fight a lawsuit) or "Chi Guan Si" (to eat a lawsuit), which is incomprehensible. Some say that "Guan Si" is the matter of officials, but what officials manage is not limited to litigation, so this explanation is also lacking.</p>
<h3>Little Raindrops</h3>
<p>— Shi Jimei</p>
<p>But, if a newborn baby laughed out loud as soon as it was born, wouldn't you feel your hair stand on end?</p>
<p>Pigs wallow in the mud, lotuses bloom white flowers in the mud.</p>
<p>When it rains, we can't hold up a small umbrella and tell people, "Now, the sky is clear."</p>
<h3>Carefree Flower</h3>
<p>— Chen Shengyan</p>
<p>Chapter 14: Carefree at Sea – 125</p>
<p>After finishing writing, I looked it over again, wondering what Qiwan would think after reading this letter? She is extremely fond of me and must feel the same. I don't hope to rekindle our old love; I only want her to understand my heart, to know my troubles, and for us to communicate through letters often, and my soul will be comforted. After writing this letter, Zhu Zhai thought about it carefully before undressing and going to bed. It felt like a major event had been completed, and his mind was much calmer. The next day, he woke up as soon as it was light. Thinking that from today onwards, he would change his life and not continue to be so muddled and confused. In the past, he worked hard to learn opera, always getting up at dawn. Now, in addition to going to the bank for work every day, he would still entrust his spirit to Peking opera. His father had said that having entertainment outside of work could regulate the spirit, so he would try it for a while. Maybe it could gradually wash away the troubles in his heart. Thinking, Zhu Zhai put on his clothes, hastily washed his face, took a sip of hot water, and hurried out. At this time, the sky was just dawning, and the air on the road was clean. Zhu Zhai walked slowly on the road, thinking to himself that in recent months, he had been so obsessed with Qiwan that his mind was unsettled, sleeping late every night and getting up late in the morning. He hadn't enjoyed this clean morning air for several months. If he hadn't suffered a severe blow, he wouldn't have come out for a walk today. He also thought about how he met Qiwan because he came out to practice his voice in the morning, which led to an unexpected romance. Unexpectedly, it was a fleeting moment, turning to emptiness in the blink of an eye, leaving behind troubles that couldn't be washed away. This kind of spiritual loss is irreparable. It shows that a person shouldn't have wishful thinking; everything should be done according to one's own place, to avoid many disputes. Thinking and walking, unknowingly, he had reached the back door of Zhongshan Park. At that moment, he remembered that he had met Qiwan in this park, but today it was all a thing of the past. "I'll go in and take a look." Thinking, he walked through the park gate, crossed the wooden bridge. Behind the garden, a bend of pond water was still quiet and still. A slight breeze swept across the surface of the pond, creating a ripple. It was already the late spring month of February, and only in the northern country did there be a hint of spring. Along the water, the willow trees, the willow branches had a hint of green, reflected in the water. The water pattern slightly rippled, the willow silk clung to each other, which was beautiful.</p>
<h3>On Poetry and Rhyme</h3>
<p>— Qinglei Academy</p>
<p>The local news section of this newspaper on March 30th contained Mr. Pan Gongzhan's poem inscribed on a painting in Hangzhou, an impromptu note, which is different from Mr. Sa Lao Zhenbing's poem of thanks to Zhong Bao on the same page, which emphasized the importance of commemorating an event. Mr. Pan saw his wife painting and, moved by the inspiration, inscribed a poem, hence comparing Sa's painting style to meticulous brushwork and Pan's to freehand brushwork. Pan's poem is also a seven-character quatrain, and the last line, "Today the earth returns to spring again," also implies the meaning of post-disaster recovery, hence it is full of vitality. But the great difference between the two poems lies in the use of rhyme.</p>
<p>Sa's poem follows the poetry rhyme (seven yang), while Pan's poem does not adhere to one rhyme (the characters 菲 (fei) and 微 (wei) belong to five wei, while the character 回 (hui) belongs to ten hui), which can be studied in terms of "principle" and "precedent." (1) In principle, "rhyme" values "harmony"; if there is no "harmony," there is no such thing as "rhyme." This principle is easy to understand. As for the so-called standard poetry rhyme, which has been practiced for more than a thousand years, there was no detailed investigation when it was formulated, and the sounds of ancient people and contemporary people, and the sounds of place A and place B, were extremely complex. Therefore, there are characters in the rhyme that are not harmonious, and characters that are harmonious are not necessarily in one rhyme. And throughout the generations, especially in response poems, the style of the Imperial Academy prevailed, using this to shackle the freedom of thought, so there has never been a modern revision. Because men of letters have no other practical standards to rely on, and it is not appropriate for everyone to follow their own convenience, leading to unbridled chaos, they can only make do. Therefore, this poetry rhyme has not been abolished due to inertia. (2) Those who are good at using this skillfully in the past either selected rhymes or selected relatively broad rhymes to use (such as the "seven yang" used by Mr. Sa, which is one of the broad rhymes, with many characters that are not mixed, even when composing long passages, it is not at a loss), or selected those that are harmonious within one rhyme and used them (such as Wang Yuyang's first poem about autumn willows, the rhyme feet "魂 (hun)", "門 (men)", "痕 (hen)", "村 (cun)", "論 (lun)" are all harmonious and very coordinated, all within the thirteen yuan rhyme category, but characters such as 繁 (fan), 園 (yuan), 原 (yuan), 援 (yuan), etc. within the thirteen yuan are absolutely discarded. Fortunately, it is a broad rhyme, even if it does not go out of rhyme, it is still easy to handle). Furthermore, crossing rhymes means not being restricted by the original purpose of poetry rhymes. For example, Zhang Tanhua's (posthumously named Wen Xiang, named Zhi Dong) poem when passing through Wuhu to mourn Envoy Yuan (Yuan Chang, whose courtesy name was Shuangqiu, once served as the Wuhu Taoist, and was killed in Gengzi as the Taichang Qing who advocated suppressing the Boxers) said: "The Seven-Nation Allied Forces knocked on the gate, knowing that you repelled the enemy and mended the sky. For thousands of years, people have mourned the Chao family order, once planning for the king for all." The rhyme foot of the first line belongs to "fifteen shan," while the last two rhymes belong to "one xian," that is, not being restricted by the rhyme category. Because it is his own work, he has this freedom. Mr. Pan's poem inscribed on Tang paintings in his tour of West Lake also crosses two rhyme categories and is also his own work, so he is not restricted. If Zhang Tanhua's works during the imperial examinations and various examinations during his tenure in the Hanlin Academy also crossed in this way, not only would he not be able to enter the Hanlin Academy, but he would probably have the same misfortune as Gao Xinkui, who had "a double fourth grade in his life, and deserved thirteen yuan to die," how harmful is the book "Poetry Rhyme"! (Gao Xinkui served as Suzhou Muyuan County during the Qing Dynasty Tongzhi period. His failure to enter the Hanlin Academy and his demotion to county magistrate was due to his poems being out of rhyme and being ranked in the fourth grade. The story is seen in Xue Fucheng's Yong'an Notes)</p>
<p>In recent years, the style of writing poetry has been very popular. The high chanting of President Zhang Qun, Dr. Weng Wenhao, General Zhang Xueliang, and General Feng Yuxiang have all been seen in the newspapers. The works of Zhou Zuoren, Jiang Kanghu, and so on, are even more common (whether they are false or not, everyone speaks their own poems, so it is also worth mentioning). Moreover, the British writer G. K. Chesterton is also vigorously promoting Chinese poetry (see Shen Bao, February 24). At this moment, when the atmosphere of war is all over the world, the leisure and elegance of national poetry travel with it, how is it different from the blue lotus in the fire and the precious raft in the sea of sin, so it is necessary to examine the details of ancient and modern, Chinese and foreign, and discuss them carefully.</p>

<p>Special Telecommunications Issue</p>
<p>Inscribed by Yu Dongjian Edited by the Business Office of the Shanghai Telecommunications Bureau, Ministry of Transportation 10th Issue</p>
<h3>Chronicle of the Inaugural Meeting of the Chinese Institute of Electrical Communication</h3>
<p>— Yue Fan</p>
<p>If we want China to become a modern and progressive country, the development of transportation and the promotion of industry are the most important tasks at present. Therefore, various academic societies with the ability to promote and improve are indispensable organizations. It has been more than seventy years since the establishment of telecommunications in China. In terms of the Ministry of Transportation alone, there are more than 40,000 telecommunications workers across the country. However, due to the backwardness of our country's science and the underdevelopment of industry, various telecommunications facilities still cannot keep pace with other advanced countries. Modern telecommunications technology is changing rapidly. If we want to build a new China's telecommunications in the future, we must catch up quickly. Therefore, on December 28th of last year, the first Telecommunications Memorial Day, the Chinese Institute of Electrical Communication was initiated by telecommunications colleagues and telecommunications experts across the country. After several months of active preparation, it was officially announced on the 11th of this month. The following is a record of the meeting of the inaugural meeting that day:</p>
<p>The venue was set on the third floor of the Shanghai Training Institute for Telecommunications Personnel on Yuyingtang Road. More than 230 people attended, including representatives of telecommunications bureaus from various regions, Wang Jiashu, instructor of the Ministry of Social Affairs, and guests Zhao Zukang, former president of the Chinese Institute of Engineers, Zhao Zengjue, president of the Chinese Institute of Electrical Engineering, and Zhuang Zhihuan, president of the Shanghai Branch of the Chinese Institute of Electrical Engineering. At 9:00 AM, the meeting began. After performing the rituals, Yu Bingjian and Lu Zongcheng, the organizing committee members of the association, reported on the significance and process of organizing the association and thanked the telecommunications comrades for their cooperation and the guests for their presence and guidance. At the same time, they hoped that domestic telecommunications professionals would participate in cooperation and research. Subsequently, the instructor of the Ministry of Social Affairs and guests Zhao Zukang, Zhao Zengjue, and Zhuang Zhihuan gave speeches, many of which were pertinent. Finally, the draft constitution was revised and association affairs were discussed. Yu Bingjian was publicly elected as the temporary chairman. After heated discussions by all members, the following resolutions were passed: (1) The main revision this year is Article 6: "Any telecommunications service personnel with more than two years of telecommunications service experience after graduating from domestic and foreign universities, more than five years after graduating from junior colleges, or technical, reporting, telephone, accounting, business, and other telecommunications personnel who have been engaged in telecommunications for more than ten years and have achieved excellent results, can be introduced by two members and become a regular member after the board of directors reviews and approves the application. Graduates of universities or junior colleges who are engaged in telecommunications or technical, reporting, telephone, accounting, business, and other telecommunications personnel who have been engaged in telecommunications for more than three years and have achieved excellent results or have equivalent qualifications can be introduced by two members and become an associate member after the board of directors reviews and approves the application." In addition to adding "seven alternate directors and three alternate supervisors" in Article 15, the rest were passed. (2) In addition to the representatives from various regions serving as ex-officio members, eleven additional people were elected as members of the electoral commission due to the complexity of this election. (3) The candidates for directors and supervisors shall be nominated at the principle of ten people per thousand people. (4) The first directors and supervisors shall be produced before May 28. (5) The first annual meeting is scheduled to be held in the capital on this year's Telecommunications Memorial Day. (6) Publish an annual. (7) Solicit telecommunications comrades from all over the country to participate enthusiastically and establish branches as soon as possible. The meeting ended at 12:00 noon and was quite enthusiastic.</p>
<h3>From an Economic Perspective – Charge Account Telegrams</h3>
<p>— Jun Zhong</p>
<p>After the victory, prices have been constantly rising. The amount of telegrams coming and going to and from the market is closely related and has become a proportional comparison. Shanghai, in particular, is a place where merchants from all over the world gather, and business is frequent. The fluctuations in the market can affect the economic changes of the whole country. Therefore, the Shanghai Telecommunications Bureau, as the central hub of the country's nervous system, is crowded with telegram senders every day, who often have to wait a long time to take their turn. In fact, express telegrams have already been delivered to the other party in this short period of time. The senders are anxious because of the wait and believe that our telecommunications bureau is inefficient and only wastes time.</p>
<p>The busiest time for receiving telegrams is usually from about 11:00 AM to 4:00 or 5:00 PM. In the short span of five or six hours, more than 10,000 telegrams must be received. And each telegram needs to go through three procedures: calculating the fee, collecting the fee, and writing a receipt. The sales staff work tensely without stopping, but they still can't clear them in time.</p>
<p>In order to compensate for the above-mentioned shortcomings and increase the speed of telegram transmission, charge account telegrams were created. Ordinary telegrams are paid for with cash. For institutions or businesses that send a lot of telegrams in a day, payment and collection will be overwhelming, not to mention wasting valuable time and affecting the speed of telegrams. Therefore, after adopting the charge account telegram method, the troublesome payment procedure is changed to a one-time return signature, which in other words saves more than two-thirds of the waiting time.</p>
<p>The registration procedure for charge account telegrams is very simple. Just fill out an application form to the business section of the telecommunications bureau, and the business section will estimate the amount of telegrams the user sends and receives each month and collect a corresponding deposit. The current minimum amount is five million yuan, which is not an excessive collection, assuming that one telegram is sent for one hundred thousand yuan per day. However, charge account telegrams have not yet been widely used by users. The biggest reason is that users generally lack understanding of the nature of charge account telegrams. Users think that paying a considerable deposit at one time means that the interest on this idle account is lost invisibly. In today's high-interest loan environment, who doesn't want to activate their funds? However, this situation seems reasonable at first glance, but it is not so in reality. Let the author give an example: At the beginning of the month, you opened a charge account and paid a deposit of five million yuan. You then continue to send telegrams every day. The interest before sending the first telegram is calculated at five million yuan. The daily interest is no more than fifty or sixty thousand yuan. The second time, the telegram fee that has been sent should be deducted, and the daily interest will be even less. By the end of the month, the amount of the deposit and the telegram fee paid are almost mutually offset. But you can still continue to use it until the specified deadline and pay the outstanding telegram fee for the previous month. In this way, the user's loss is minimal, but they can obtain interest benefits by making good use of charge account telegrams.</p>
<p>We hope that users can understand our actual situation and make full use of charge account telegrams to help the speed and accuracy of telegram sending.</p>
<h3>Machine Capacity Reached Limit, Telephone Installation Suspended in Hongkou District</h3>
<p>Telecommunications News</p>
<p>The Hongkou district of this city is vast, with numerous merchants and organizations, and the need for telephones is extremely high. However, due to the limited capacity of the original machine keys, supply cannot meet demand. Although the bureau has repeatedly planned to expand, the source of machine keys is scarce, and improvement and expansion cannot be realized in a short period of time. The current capacity of the Hongkou central office is 2,600 lines. As of now, the number of users actually installed has reached the maximum limit, and it is impossible to increase the load further. In the future, applicants for new installations in the Hongkou (including Zhabei) district will not be able to be installed temporarily until the machine keys of the central office are improved and expanded.</p>

<h3>A Brief History of the Invention of the Telephone</h3>
<p>— Wang Dachun</p>
<p>We all know that the inventor of the telephone was Alexander Graham Bell. However, when he invented the telephone, there was also an Elisha Gray who also invented a telephone. On February 14, 1876, they both sent the machines they invented to the U.S. Federal Patent Office to request registration. In terms of time, Bell was only two hours earlier than Gray. Although these two telephones, after testing, Bell's was more flexible and was adopted, and has been improved and used to this day. However, it cannot be said that it is a miracle in the history of invention that two people who do not know each other study the same problem in the same place at the same time and invent the same machine and publish it to the world.</p>
<p>Gray was born in Barnesville, Ohio, USA. He devoted his life to the study of electricity and finally invented a telephone. Unfortunately, his results were not as good as Bell's simultaneous invention, so his hard work was lost in obscurity. Bell was born in Edinburgh, the capital of Scotland, in 1870. He went to Canada with his father. Two years later, he moved to Boston, USA, and taught at Boston University. He liked to study electricity since he was a child. At first, he wanted to transmit sound waves to distant places by means of electricity. After several years of experimentation, in 1876, he made the first telephone, which was the beginning of the invention of the telephone. Bell's father was originally a kind person who taught poor deaf children. Young Bell was influenced by him and also taught many deaf children in Canada, not only teaching them to use signals instead of speaking, but also using his experimental telephone to transmit meanings to distant places using various different sound wave signals.</p>
<p>In addition, there is another electrical inventor that we cannot forget, and that is the well-known Thomas Edison. In addition to inventing electric lights and electric railways, this man made great contributions to the improvement of telegraphs and telephones. As a child, Edison was just a newspaper boy at the Milan train station in Ohio, USA, but he had great ambitions. He used his savings to buy a small printing press and lead type, and printed his small newspaper and sold it when traveling on the train. Travelers were moved by curiosity and eagerly bought his newspaper. Edison thus saved more money to buy various books and scientific instruments. Because he often entered and exited the train station, he was very familiar with the railway staff and borrowed a baggage car as a laboratory. Unfortunately, once he overturned some acid liquid, and a fire broke out in the train. Although it was extinguished, the baggage car manager kicked him out of the station. At that time, his scientific experiments could hardly continue. Later, on one occasion, he saw a child standing on the railway track at the station as a train approached. Edison jumped onto the track and rescued the child, regardless of his own safety. This was the stationmaster's son, who was grateful for Edison's kindness in saving his son and invited him to be the station's telegraph operator. From then on, he had the opportunity to study telegraphs and telephones and invented the Quadruplex Telegraph System, which can send four telegrams simultaneously on one telegraph line. In terms of telephones, he invented a Carbon Granual Transmitter, which is used in our telephones. In addition, there are many telephone machines that have been improved by him and are now in use. He is truly a great contributor to the history of telephone invention.</p>
<h3>Telegraph Common Sense Talks (10)</h3>
<p>— Zhang Jiayu</p>
<p>Lecture 4: How to Write the Recipient's Name and Address</p>
<p>Since the post office changed the weight unit for airmail letters from every ten centimeters to twenty centimeters, it is said that the sales of airmail envelopes in various stationery stores have been greatly discounted. The reason is obvious: before the weight unit for airmail letters was changed, any airmail letter weighing more than ten centimeters but less than twenty centimeters had to be charged double the airmail postage. Our purpose in sending letters is nothing more than to convey the words written on the letter to the recipient. Who would be willing to pay an extra postage fee just to use a thicker (heavier) envelope?</p>
<p>If we apply the same mentality to telegrams, which are charged according to the number of words, our purpose in sending telegrams is nothing more than to convey the message to the recipient. Who would be willing to increase the burden of telegram fees for a lengthy recipient's name and address? However, before you understand the various tricks of saving words in the recipient's name and address, you have to write the name and address in detail, otherwise the telegram will be delivered incorrectly or not delivered at all. Don't believe it? Please see the examples below:</p>
<p>"Shanghai, North Zhongshan 1st Road (786), Lane (84), Li Zixing, Remit Quickly, Wang"</p>
<p>The above is the full text of a telegram, totaling seventeen words (the place name "Shanghai" is counted as one word), including the recipient's location and recipient's name and address, which account for thirteen words, the message three words, and the sender's signature one word. Except for the sender's signature, which the sender can decide whether or not it's needed, the sender spends almost only one-sixth of the total telegram fee on what he actually wants to say—the message—but the cost spent on the recipient's name and address accounts for almost five-sixths of the total telegram fee. Its uneconomical nature is conceivable. However, if you try to save words by reducing any word in the name and address at will, it may cause delivery errors or even non-delivery, which may lead to a mistake.</p>
<p>In this lecture, the author intends to introduce to the readers one by one the various methods of saving words and fees in writing the recipient's name and address. Needless to say, when it comes to the most economical and effective method of saving the number of words in the recipient's name and address, it naturally has to be</p>
<p>telegraph registered. The "registration" mentioned here is completely different in nature from registered letters in the post office or registration for medical consultation. Let us try to use an example to illustrate the use of telegraph registration. For example: There is a Gongyu foreign firm in Shanghai, and its address is No. 7 Zhongzheng East Road, Shanghai. Before it has registered with the telegraph office, all telegrams sent to it from all parties must specify the recipient's name and address in detail as "Gongyu Foreign Firm, No. 7 Zhongzheng East Road, Shanghai", which is charged as eleven words (the recipient's location "Shanghai" is counted as one word). If it first goes to the local telegraph office to register a telegraph registration number, that is, identifies one word—say 0361 (Gong)—as the code for its name and address, then all telegrams sent to it from all parties only need to write the recipient's name and address and the recipient's location as "0361 Shanghai", which is charged as two words. In other words: After it recognizes the telegraph registration number, each telegram sent to it from all parties can save nine words of telegram fees.</p>
<p>Telegraph registration is divided into two types: Chinese and foreign languages. Foreign language registration is limited to no more than ten letters, and Chinese registration is stipulated as four digits. However, in Shanghai, due to the insufficient supply of four-digit registration numbers, a new type of six-digit Chinese registration number has recently been added. The validity period of telegraph registration is divided into long-term and short-term types. The long-term is one year, and the short-term is three months. The fees are very low. The registration fee paid by registered users every month is only equivalent to the telegram fee of ten ordinary Chinese telegram words. Foreign language registration and Chinese registration can be used in both Chinese and foreign language telegrams. Telegrams sent from abroad can also use foreign language registration to replace the recipient's name and address.</p>
<p>For telegrams sent to registered users for transfer, just add the words "transfer to someone" after the recipient's location, for example, "0361 Shanghai transfer Wang Zhiren", and for foreign languages, just write the recipient's name in front of the telegraph registration number, adding the word c/o (transfer) in the middle, for example, Wangchihjen c/o Jointmerc Shanghai (assuming Jointmerc is the foreign language telegraph registration number of a certain user), but in order to avoid delays in transfer, it is better to go directly to the telegraph office to register a telegraph registration number yourself, followed by</p>
<p>telephone number to replace recipient's address For telegrams sent to recipients who have telephones installed in the local receiving bureau, the telephone number installed at the recipient's residence can also be used to replace the recipient's address, but the recipient's name must be specified, and the word "Telephone" must be added in front of the telephone number, for example (Chinese telegram) or "Telephone (11130) Shanghai Zhang Jiayu" "Changchiayu Telephone 11130 Shanghai" (foreign language telegram). After receiving this telegram, the telegraph bureau first checks the address of the telephone user with the number 11130 in the local telephone book, and then opens it into a telegram envelope together with the recipient's name for delivery.</p>
<p>The nature of using a post office box number to replace the recipient's address is not much different from using a telephone number to replace the recipient's address. For telegrams sent to recipients who have rented post office boxes in the local receiving bureau, the post office box number can also be used to replace the recipient's address, but the recipient's name must be specified, and the words "Post Office Box" must be added in front of the post office box number, for example, "Shanghai Post Office Box (486) Xu Dazhong" (Chinese telegram) or "Hsudahchung Postal Box 486 Shanghai" (foreign language telegram). After receiving this telegram, the telegraph bureau will send it to the local post office and put it into the post office box with the specified number, allowing the box renter to pick it up himself. From here, we can imagine that if the box renter does not go to the post office to pick it up at any time, the telegram may be delayed.</p>
<p>If the recipient has neither a telegraph registration number nor a telephone or post office box, then the name and address must be written in detail for telegrams sent to him from all parties, but please remember the following points:</p>
<p>(1) Where street names, neighborhoods, etc. can be replaced by numbers, it is not necessary to use the full name of the street or lane, but only the number of the street or lane, for example, "(380) Street" is counted as only two words.</p>
<p>(2) The house number can be written in Arabic numerals in parentheses, and it is not necessary to write it word by word. For example, "three hundred and eighty-five" is counted as six words, but "(385) No." is counted as only two words.</p>
<p>(3) If there are words such as A, B, C, D, etc. after the house number, the foreign letters ABCD can be used instead. For example, "No. 32 A" can be written as "(32A) No.", which is counted as only two words.</p>
<p>(4) The recipient's title, such as "Mr.", "Ms.", "Director", "Uncle", etc., should be avoided as much as possible.</p>
<p>(5) If the name and address are written in English, then it is best to spell out the recipient's name completely, for example, write Zhang Jiayu as Changchiayu, so that it can be combined into one word. If you write CY Chang, it will be counted as three words. The name of the street can also be written together, for example, Nanjing Road can be written as Nankingroad or NanKingrd.</p>
<p>(6) There are many places with the same place names in China and foreign countries. For example, Xi'an, the capital of Shaanxi Province in our country, was originally named Chang'an, but there is also a Chang'an County in Zhejiang Province; people only know that the capital of Chile is called Santiago, but who knows that there are as many as forty-nine places called Santiago in the world. In this case, the sender must add the country name or province name after the place name to avoid sending it wrong. The recipient's location, regardless of the length of the number of words, such as "Shanghai", "Harbin", "Er Lizihu", and regardless of whether the country name or province name is added after the place name, is counted as one word.
