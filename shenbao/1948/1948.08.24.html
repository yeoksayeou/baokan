<h3>全國人民愛護新幣　踴躍兌出金銀外鈔　總統聽取報告深感欣慰</h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿三日電〕蔣總統廿三日晨於主持中央紀念週後，即召見翁文灝·與鐵城·洪蘭友等，對實施財經緊急處分令事有所垂詢，並悉：翁氏於廿三日晚再謁總統，報告實施財經緊急處分後開關第一日之市塲情况，滬·穗·平·津·漢等之各大都市報告，亦已於晚間電達，一般情形均極良好，美鈔，黃金前往調換者極衆，總統聞悉第一日即有此良好結果，深感欣慰。另悉：總統日內仍將赴牯。</p>
<p>〔本報南京廿三日電〕人民持有金·銀·外幣兌換金圓券，廿三日爲第一日，京人民自動前往中央銀行兌換者，呈異常踴躍狀態，成續之佳，已超出一般人預料之外，據中央銀行京行漏夜統計所得數字，廿三日收兌之美金計達五萬四千三百九十一元，銀幣爲二萬二千三百十一元，白銀純量爲一〇四兩，港幣爲三七〇九元，黃金爲一千七百四十七兩，至廿四日晨二時始全部結算完畢，總計廿三日全日兌出金圓券二三八萬圓，折合法幣達七萬一千四百億元，人民踴躍將金·銀·外幣兌換金圓券，除足徽國人愛國心之深厚外，並可爲幣制改革必能成功之最大保證。</p>
<p>〔本報南京廿三日電〕金圓券廿三日起正式發行，京市兌換情形至爲踴躍，物價亦多趨下游，休業兩日之銀行，錢莊，信託公司及信用合作社，均於廿三日起復業，中央銀行南京分行辦埋收兌黃金，白銀，外幣，銀元及法幣工作，至廿三日午夜猶進行淸算整理，全體工作人員均澈夜工作，廿三日京市民前往中央銀行兌換金圓券者，人數至衆，雖在微雨中前往兌換者仍踴躍異常，絡繹不絕。市民均自動排隊，行列自戶內排至戶外，由金城大樓央行京分行直迄馥記大樓美援運用委會，長達數百公尺，甚至有鵠候數小時者，人民持黃金，白銀，外幣前往兌換金圓劵者，情况尤熱烈。</p>

<h3>翁院長在國民黨紀念週　報告政府當前重要措施　保障社會秩序建立穩定基礎</h3>
<p>〔中央社南京廿三日電〕國民黨中央黨部廿三日晨舉行紀念週，蔣總裁親自主持，行政院長翁文灝出席報吿政府當前重要措施。翁院長稱：當前最須切實進行的，是二件事，一是禁遏奸匪的破壞與侵擾，以保障社會的秩序。二是停止通貨膨服與市塲的波動，以達到經濟的穩定。共實社會秩序與經濟穩定，此二件事互相關聯，互相影響，實在是同一件事，政府的工作，必須同時並進，且得到社會人心一致響應，方能收實在的成效。</p>
<p>近時政府對此類任務，認眞努力工作，業已開始，正待持之以恒，繼續不怠，以期充份實現，重要情形，擇要說明如左：</p>
<p>第一，是檢査並禁押後方各地受奸匪利用的間諜，此種間諜近來往往桃撥離間，鼓動罷學，能工等風潮，釀成暴動擾亂的現象。政府爲保障治安，維持秩序計，不能不由主管機關負責主持，軍警方面，努力協助，除暴即所以安良，懲奸即所以遏亂，目爲公正訊斷起見，所有在案各人，均交由特種法庭依法訊硏，分別情形輕重，迅速處理。大家須要明悉，此次戡亂剿匪，純爲維護國本，保衛人民，大義昭然，其意義所在，政府曾經先行布吿國民，明辨是非，共赴國難。我國父致力國民革命，樹立民主政治的基礎，我總統統一全國，精誠抗日，收回五十年來的失地，取消一百年來的不平等條約，中共方面始終假借名義，禍國殃民，事實昭然，深望社會人士同明正義，勿入迷途，以發揚正當國民應有的風度。</p>
<p>第二，是改革幣制，實行停止通貨膨脹，使全國有穩實可靠之貨幣，良以自對日抗戰以來，法幣數量自已較多，但全國滿望日本投降以後，在和平環境中，實行建設，早達康樂，不幸共匪不顧大局，蓄意擾亂，歷年不停，法幣發行的數額，因之更爲加多，復以市塲上時有奸商投機取巧，囤積居奇，走私漏稅，種種活動，遂致物價高漲，生活不安，國計民生，均深受其害。現在發行的金圓劵，力艦此弊，首有十足準備，公開發表，次爲定有限額，決不膨脹，三有多量金屬轉幣，便利流通，四由政府對於國際貿易及基他正當用途，依照規定匯率認眞支特，因此可保有堅實可靠之信用，足以撤銷以前各種不穩定之因素，依照近代經濟學理，通貨爲各種經濟現象之基本，通貨膨脹，則必使市面不安，通貨堅定，則貿易交換得有價値確實，信用充足之媒介，泉源旣通，水流自正，同時政府決定方針，收入力求增多，支出妥爲節約，期達预算之平衡，復當加多輸出貿易，鼓勵僑匯通暢，以改善國際之收支，基本條件，旣能澈底改良，建立正軌，市塲物價自絕無更受波動的理由，政府旣已苦心籌劃，採取了此種正本淸源的辦法，對於不肖商人，仍要存心破壞者，自當視爲國家民族的公敵，盡力阻禁，嚴加處分，決不容此少數人的私利行爲，損害此新時代的光明現象。</p>
<p>第三，是收兌及收存，中國領土以內所有的黃金·白銀及外國幣券，此類外匯金銀及外國幣券，依照近代各國通行辦法，決不能允許在國內自由流通行使，或作爲投機市場的工具，此次辦法規定了三種出路：（一）是用以兌取金圓券，（二）是收購美金公價，（三）爲在國家銀行內，設立外匯存款，保持其所有權，仍可供作正當用途。如此辦法，實極具優待的意義，照此辦理，保全了所有權，仍可支付正當的用途，實是有利無害，如果原持有人遲疑規避，過了法定的期限，仍不肯依照法定出路，實行兌換或存儲，那是原持有人蔑親法律，負利自私，貽害於國家的公益，因此，一經査獲，即當悉行沒收充公，此眞罰當其罪，決非苛刻。此外，尙有少數地方，如廣州的使用港鈔，靑島的使用美鈔，均爲極不規則的行爲，必須迅即改良，換取中國鈔券，此乃是正當國民份內應有的行爲，極望其速即實現。又有若干人，喜將本國資金走漏於外國地方置備財產，當此國家需財孔殷，政府切實振作的時代，而此等人的作爲，乃背道而馳，忘了自身的國籍，實成爲損害國家的行爲，在外人看來，未為可恥，本人撫心自問，亦應知愧。試看歐洲各國自上次大戰以後，莫不盡量禁止資金的輸出，連正當的國外投資，都暫爲停止，吾國豈能坐視漏滬，不圖抑止。此次亦規定處理辦法，歡迎有良心的國民踴躍輸將，不但保全了他們的人格，亦且貢獻於國家。從以上的簡要說明，可見奸匪要破壞社會的秩序，政府正在盡力維護，奸匪要我們通貨惡性膨脹，政府已堅決的打銷了膨脹，奸匪要搖動與摧毀了我們的經濟，政府正在建立根本穩定的基礎，在這個針鋒相對，積極奮鬥的時代，極望全國同胞認淸了正確的方向，合力一心，共同前進。</p>
<h3>央行俞總裁　電賀王財長</h3>
<p>恭喜國人愛護新幣</p>
<p>〔中央社南京廿三日電〕財政部長王雲五於廿三日上午十一時接中央銀行總裁兪鴻鈞電話，報吿上海情形，兪氏於通話中第一句話，即向王部長說：恭喜！恭喜！恭喜國人對新幣之愛護。</p>
<h3>司使通知美僑　遵令兌我新幣　友邦人民均熱誠合作</h3>
<p>〔中央社南京廿三日電〕政府於公布財政經濟緊急處分令後，即行通知美國大使館，請其轉知在華美僑。據悉：美駐華司徒大使業已迅速通知在華美國軍民，關於兌換事宜，應予切實遵照中國政府所頒去令辦理。聞各地美僑自今日起，紛紛持美鈔向當地國家銀行兌換新幣，此種友邦僑民合作之熱忱，殊堪嘉佩。</p>
<h3>港金融市塲穩定　銀行界對我新措施樂觀　認官定匯率可激勵僑匯</h3>
<p>〔中央社香港廿三日電〕自金圓與港幣之匯率確定為港幣一元對金圓七角五分後，此間四大國冢銀行及其他各大銀行，廿三日已按率辦理內匯。由於金圓基礎穩定，各銀行所定匯率爲港幣一百元對金圓七十四元，匯費在外。黃金市塲於緊急幣制改革後一度頗見混亂，今已安然渡過，晨間開盤情况轉佳。觀察家認爲官定港幣與金圓之匯率，乃穩定市塲之重要因素。今晨開盤時，黃金每兩爲港向三百廿三元，其後擾揚，中午至三百廿四元五，至收盤時，仍回至三百廿三元，美鈔五元四角一，其問升降甚微，僅一二分之差。本地行莊之上海紐約匯率爲港幣四角五分對法幣一百萬元，銀行及金融界人士一般雖抱靜觀態度，然對新經濟措施之結果，咸表樂觀。據稱：金圓與港幣之官定匯率極爲適當，且合實際，除能淸除對新幣之投機外，且可激勵僑匯，遏止游資逃避香港。美國·東南亞·及世界各地華僑於有利之匯率下，此後均將直接匯款國內，而無貶値之虞。</p>
<h3>整理財政管制金融　補充辦法草擬中　財工兩部將提明日政務會討論</h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿三日電〕財政經濟緊急處分令中「整理財政及加強管制金融」之貢施補充辦法，財部及工商部運日積極草擬，已有大部完成，財部廿三日上午舉行會議時，復作進一步之研討，並定於廿四日上午舉行部務會議，俟各項補充辦法於廿四日由王蕓五核定後，即可提出廿五日政務會議討論。工商部所草擬之補充辦法，亦已有部分完成，廿三日下午管制司長費明揚會召集該司人士舉行會議，商管制物價，取締囤積居奇之補充辦法，將於廿四日提請陳啓天核定，提出廿五日政務會討論。</p>
<p>〔中央社本市訊〕據上海郵政局，上海電信局消息：關於郵　及電報費之恢復戰前標準問題，須待本週四行政院政務會議決定後，始可實施。郵費每封在金圓券五分至一角之間，電報費每字在一角至二角之間。</p>

<h3>新幣制與物價管制</h3>
<p>貨幣是物價的尺度，同時物價也是貨幣的尺度。所以要穩定物價，不可不先穩定幣値：而要穩定幣値，尤不可不同時穩定物價，這是一定不易的道理。此次改革幣制，同時採取許多措置，以加强物價的管制，中樞及地方首長並一再强調，以八月十九日的物價爲標準，只許跌，不許漲，違者送特種刑庭嚴辦；而時人對於今後物價的動向如何，亦大家非常關切，認爲新幣制之成功與否，不難於物價上覘其究竟，這就可見物價與幣制關係密切之一斑。</p>
<p>除作爲交易的媒介外，貨幣的另一作用，爲價値的貯藏，在事實上的表現，爲人民儲蓄，卽行莊存款的多寡。所以新幣制如果確實健全，則以後各種存款，必將增加，市塲游資必將銳减；而投機囤積的風氣，亦必將大爲轉變。此次所頒財政經濟緊急處分令中，除聲明十足準備公開發行以外，對於投機囤積的取締，與行莊資本的增加，亦俱有嚴密的規定；而滬津兩地的交易所，並令暫行停業，其意自在疎導游資，納入正軌，以鞏固新幣的價値，提高人民的儲蓄。</p>
<p>現在所採用的是管理金本位制，雖係十足準備，但並不予以兌現，其與美元的比率，雖確定爲四比一，但外滙並未開放，故爲鞏固幣値促進儲蓄起見，除了公開發行，限制發行額，鑄造實質輔幣，力求財政收支與國際收支的平衡以外，確亦別無可以充實之處。惟在新幣開始發行，舊幣收兌尙未到期以前，如果舊幣的收兌額不能與新幣的發行額相抵銷，則實際流通的籌碼，與游資充斥的程度，或將超過於從前。又交易所停業期內，剩餘資金，不免少一去路，而民間所藏的黄金，白銀，與外幣，在遵令兌換的時候，國家又不得不發行等額新幣以資收兌。此類金銀與外幣，爲數當不在少，其收兌期又限於本年九月底以前，在這短短的四十日期間以內，所發收兌的鉅額新幣，究應如何消納，以期避免膨脹，與保持新幣之價値，這問題實在十分重要，未知政府除於兌給美金公債與任令存入央行以外，已否另籌切實有效的對策？</p>
<p>至於物價方面：政府所恃以爲加强管制的，其具體辦法如下：</p>
<p>（一）限價卽將全部物價，凍結於本月十九日的水準上，逾此水準，卽作爲黑市，送特種刑庭究辦。這在理論上，自很圓滿。因爲物價從此不漲，卽幣値從此不跌，生活指數自可從此取消，而投機囤積，亦將無利可圖了。不過限價這種手段，在過去適用於少數都市和特定的物品時，其收效並不甚著。例如本市的米價麵粉價，屢次限價，屢次取消，終於任其自然了事。這並不是當局辦理之不善，乃是經濟局勢過於動盪，人民守法精神過於薄弱，自有其難以嚴格執行的必然性。現在要把這種限價，普徧地實施於全國，且普徧地實施於全部商品，在執行的技術上，究應如何改善，如何加强，確還値得精細研究。</p>
<p>（二）禁止刋載黑市這是很容易辦得到的。但照過去的金鈔而論，儘管報紙一字不提，而黑市價格，大家耳熟能詳，到底沒有禁絕得了。如果眞要遏絕黑市消息，以免刺激物價，則在技術上似乎也還待改進。尤其是靑厦穗等處，金鈔市面完全公開，內地許多省份，銀元是實際買賣的尺度和媒介，並不單是投機的對象，這種公開的黑市，是否禁止報紙刋載所能消滅，確乎還是一個問題。否則看得那麼簡單，或將招掩耳盜鈴之誚。</p>
<p>（三）檢奎倉庫其意蓋在禁止囤積，以期穩定物價：這在上海，已經在逐步推進中。姑不論有許多倉庫，據說別有理由，未便一律檢査，縱許一律檢査，其超過法定數量和期間的貨物，亦無非加以沒牧或拍賣罷了。這在短時期內，以充公拍賈數量之龐大，雖或可收相當的平價之效，但事過境遷，物資减少，或以檢査過嚴，來源受阻，則以供不敷求之結果，未嘗不可以招致相反的惡果。所以檢査倉庫這件事，其實際上的效果恐也並不如理想之大。</p>
<p>（四）嚴辦投機囤積關於這一點，除於緊急處分令中一再申明以外，並經總統嚴令各省市切實遵辦，一面設立經濟管制會，於滬津穗三市，特派大員，負責督，以後嚴辦査察，執法以繩，各地囤風自可漸戢。所可慮的，是：（一）執行査緝的人員，未必悉能「忠實守法」，過去這一類假公濟私的案件，發見的已不在少數。（二）眞正的大囤戶，大投機商，又往往長袖善舞，具有背景，且不患無相當的名義可資假借。尤其是一般非官非商亦官亦商的特殊人物，廣通聲氣，花巧百出。這種風氣，如果稍涉寬假，不能「以强力打破」，則一切管制政策，恐仍將流爲具文，未必能收穩定物價之效。</p>
<p>（五）限制薪資取消以生活費指數計算的方式，限定一切員工薪資，不許擅行增加，這自然也是穩定物價的途徑之一。但我們不可忘却，薪資增加，固可抬高物價，而物價抬高，亦卽是增加薪資的主因，這兩者是互爲因果的。</p>
<p>（六）拋售物資·供給旣充，物價自平，這辦法，比較最爲切實。不過在實行拋售的時候，不問它是剩餘物資，敵僞物資，或定購收購的物資，斷不可偏重利潤，公然抬價，致蹈領導漲價的覆轍。其國營事業所出各項產品，尤應切實减價，率先奉行，以爲平價之提倡。資源會業已電令所屬各單位，對於各項產品售價，槪按本月十九日當地價格，折合金圓，絕對不得增加，違者撤懲。這項禁令，希望它能永久維持下去。</p>
<p>（七）减低利息利息爲搆成成本的要素之一，减低利息，卽所以减輕成本：這於抑平物價，自不無小補，中央銀行已經商定：國行日拆利率爲二分一厘，放款月息不得趙過三分，同業存款及國家行局庫存款利率爲按月二分，商業行莊方面，亦已决定，存款之月息爲三分，放款一角五分，這與過去市塲利率相差甚遠。但在這新舊遞嬗之交，這等利率，能否引起一般存戶之興趣，却尙待事實之體明。如果存款一時未能激增，而申請貸款的倒紛紛而來，是否可以暫停放款爲理由，槪予謝絕？現在各種形式的地下錢莊，其活動力似未見削弱，而商號之收受存款，尤爲普徧的現象。假如工商界之正當需要，未有適當的途徑可以滿足，恐怕减低利息這一着，事實上亦不無障礙。</p>
<p>上述各種辦法，雖屬瑕瑜互見，未必卽足以達到穩定物價的目的；但我們列舉利弊的本意，仍在力促當局尋求改進，以發揮管制的作用，絕非消極指摘，冀打消管制的束縛。至於治本之圖，不外發展生產，增加供應，以期自然的抑平物價。此則有賴於當局的進一步措施，諸如改善工業環境，减低生產費用，以及便利運輸，增加動力等等。在表面上看來，雖與新幣制關係較疎，實則生產如不能努力增加，物價終難一旦抑平。所以我們以爲只是枝枝節節從治標上努力，還是不够的，應該從大處遠處做起，力求根本的解决。翁院長對於金融及工商界代表中，亦已指出調節民生日用必需品之產銷供應，爲改革幣制的基本條件之一。我們希望，這些基本條件，應同時切實推進，以自然地達到穩定物價之目標。</p>

<h3>克林姆宮昨日最後折衝　史達林參加會談　預料對德問題可獲協議</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕倫敦廿三日廣播莫斯科訊：英美法三國使節廿三日晨在法國大使館舉行會議。傳法國與英美之異見，已在週末交換照會中獲得消除，致一般樂觀情緒，又隨克林姆宮決定性會議之接近而增强。預料三使節將於當日下午或晚間晤見蘇外長莫洛托夫，或謂史達林屆時亦將在座。據可靠消息，法大使夏台岳已自巴黎接獲新訓令，另據消息靈通之法人方面稱，英美法三國使節將於星期一夜在克林姆宮會晤史達林，預料會議將於下午八時（標準時間）舉行。</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕消息靈通之觀察家預料，克林姆宮之會議將獲得若干協議，故史達林願意參加此會。倘會議獲有協定，則四國首都將同時公佈。</p>
<p>〔合衆社倫敦廿三日電〕由英外次史屈朗·美大使陶格拉斯及法大使馬西格里所組成之「三人緊急委員會一，今晨在英外部集會，據悉會議生題爲討論三國對克林姆談話之次一步驟。</p>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓廿三日電〕外交界人士廿三日稱，四强莫斯科會議已臨決定階段，然結果仍在未定之天。如在最後關頭無意外新障礙發生，則舉世可於週末前獲知長期秘密談判之結果。官方一致認爲目前無論樂觀悲觀，均不相宜。據稱，談判已至一階段，市能左右「冷戰」之存廢。英美法蘇四國之討論，主要以柏林陸上封鎖爲中心，現已入第四個星期，恐亦爲最後一個星期。英美法三大使廿二日會商二小時，據悉，彼等已準備就緒，即可與莫洛托夫展開第六次亦即最後一次會議。關於該項重大談判之逐次進展情形，此間一無所聞。國務院除承認世界上有莫斯科其地，及在該地有討論德國之談判外，餘則守口若瓶。然可靠方面透露會議之下列廣泛性質：柏林封鎖仍爲最主要之問題，次要注意力集中於其他德國問題及召開四外長會議之可能性。英美法對付蘇聯之要求時，正採取統一陣綫，外傳上週三强發生齟齬之說，此間不予置信，四强不致因莫斯科談話而着手處理德國和約，除非西方國家認爲再接再厲即可克底於成。據悉，西方認爲如再提此事，僅足以引起世人對和平前途之誤會。</p>

<p>至於安得曼係於昨日在英佔區被捕，以報復西區警員多人之被綁架。英當局稱，安氏可能受德國法庭審訊，然希登旣釋，西方亦即將安氏送歸。同時英美當局增援波茨坦默廣塲之巡邏隊，以防綁架事之再度發生。美人已賜廣塲以「綁票角」之渾名。該地交通因東西關係緊張而幾吿停頓。黑市商人已絕跡該地。</p>

<h3>人權委員會通過　新聞公約修正　該案再將提交聯大批准</h3>
<p>〔中央社日內瓦廿二日合衆電〕據美國代表稱：聯合國經社理事會之人權委員會所通過之新聞自由公約，實已削弱五十餘國參加之聯合國會議所草擬之原件內容。原件係與新聞之搜集，及其在國際間之傳播有關，今日經過整日之程序問題爭執後，參與投票表決之國家，共十六國，計贊成者九票：「美，英，中，法，丹，荷，秘魯，土耳其，及委內瑞拉」；反對者三票：：蘇聯，波蘭，白俄羅斯」；棄權者四票：「加，澳，紐西蘭，及黎巴嫩」。因東西方之僵持局面，人權委員會尙須以新聞公約之修正案，提交即在巴黎召開之聯合國大會。前者由於蘇聯之反對，人權委員會對第一公約之考慮，曾遭延宕，達兩星期之久。且對已通過而爭執仍多之修正案，亦無法考慮。美代表並稱：因有不再提建議之決定，故大會批准是項公約之機會，已吿减少。</p>

<p>〔法國新聞社仰光廿二日電〕此間消靈通各界之意，暹羅若祗有承平時薄弱之空軍，則全國將陷於叛徒之手。目前復發生一種巨大之新威脅，即所謂「森林之貓」者，彼等爲雜色痞徒，而不服從任何人，專事刦掠强姦易欺之村民，彼等現爲今日之權威，而嚴厲實施命令，政府與叛徒今均不知如何應付此種新因素。政府因平亂而逃亡者纍纍，故兵力單薄，已無餘暇且無實力撲滅「森林之貓」，其中且有少婦，每日能乘騎馳行長途。白團一部份之叛變，使軍械皆落於此輩刦掠者之手。</p>

<h3>黑人和猶太人的精神領袖　向「恐怖時代」抗議　美國十一月大選前奏曲之五</h3>
<p>— 本報駐美特派員　毛樹清</p>
<p>華萊士的進步黨成立之初，流亡在香港的中國革命委員會和民主同盟，都有電賀華萊士。在美國，據紐約時報約略的估計，進步黨在今年十一月大選中，可能得三百多萬選票，較一九一二年老羅斯福時代的進步黨，大致相仿，華萊士的有力擁護者，大半是靑年·婦女·勞工·或退伍軍人，在費城進步黨成立大會上，出席代表約二千人，旁聽的多至八千人，出席代表之中，婦女占百分之三十，四十歲以下的佔百分之六十，工會會員佔百分之三十五，退伍軍人佔百分之二十。</p>
<p>曾塲情形是亂糟糟的，較共和黨·民主黨的情形更亂，大部份決議，在吶喊呌囂中通過。黨的組成份子，除了上面這四項以外，黑人和猶太人，在黨裏很出風頭。開幕詞是伊沃華州的黑人律師霍華德（華萊士同鄕）講的。霍華德最初講人類需要和平，美國祗有華萊士，可以拯救和平。他說：進步黨當選以後，準備蓋八百萬幢住宅，以解救美國嚴重的房荒問題。進步黨主張大工業收歸國有，規定工人之最低工資，爲每小時一塊錢。他說：進步黨主張職業平等，廢除種族歧視。他說：「自從我追隨華萊士先生以來，我享受到從來沒有的平等待遇，……過去共、和黨和民主黨也講廢除稱族歧視，但他們仍然滿腦子的白人至上，特別在南方幾州，尤其厲害。」霍華德講得精神抖擻，台下有很多白人和黑人鼓掌。</p>
<p>猶太人在美國也算是被壓迫的「少數民族」，許多猶太籍的美國公民，現在都成了華萊士的信徒。有位猶太籍的國會議員伊薩克遜，是這次華萊士的黨員大會中最出風頭的代表之一。有人說：這次伊薩克遜一篇演講，至少巷華萊士爭取幾十萬張選票，看情形是非常可能的事。這位伊薩克遜，是紐約第廿四區選出的國會衆議員，新近從巴勒斯坦視察回來，他說：杜魯門政府正在與英國進行對猶太國的新陰謀，準備逐步封鎖新成立的猶太國。杜魯門政府警視猶太人，目前他們所做的假惺惺的表現，完全爲了應付十一月選舉，爭取選票，一旦選舉完畢以後，他們預備宣佈猶太國（以色列國）由英美保護，英國依然將取得「以色列」的港口，作爲他們的軍事根據地，將耶魯撒冷出賣給外約坦的回敎國王阿勃杜拉，並且嚴格限制猶太移民入境，這樣，無異將猶太國成爲外約坦王國的附屬品，同時也重新回復到「大英帝國」的一部。他說：猶太人幾十年奮鬥的結晶，將被杜魯門政府摧殘殆盡，「因爲共和黨民主黨這些政客們，仍然抱有根深蒂固的種族徧見，歧視猶太人！」</p>
<p>伊薩克遜設明他這次視察所見，全是正確的，他說：杜魯門總統如果要「否認」這些事實，他願意再陪總統去看一趟。他說：儘管你們資本家，爲了中東近東油田的利益，在作違反猶太人生存權益的企圓，但是猶太人是不會被征服的。他說：「幾十年來，希特勒的野蠻，大英帝國的殘暴，都無法使猶太人絕滅。相反的，像屹立的巨人一樣，新的猶太國依然新生！」伊薩克遜呼籲猶太籍的美國公民，一致起來擁護華萊士，擁護進步黨！</p>
<p>在進步黨的宣言裏，也曾特別强調保護猶太人和黑人的權益，廢止一切「人權」的限制，反對南方的「人頭稅」，嚴禁私刑謀殺，廢除種族歧視。在外交政綱中，並且明定全力去助新成立的「猶太國」，並且立即對猶太國貸給鉅款。</p>
<p>華萊士今天能够成爲美國黑人和猶太人的精神領袖，也許是他當初做夢也想不到的。實際上，如果推根究源，原也有他一貫的綫索。華萊士在羅斯福的大一統時代，本來是所謂民主黨的左派，他主張親蘇聯共，主張國營工業，主張社會主義，這和傳統的美國民主精神，傳統的「自由企業自由競爭」的精神大相水火。華萊士是立志要打破「現狀」的，因之，凡是不滿意現狀的美國人，自然而然都集中到華萊士的屬圍來，這原也是順乎自然的現象。華萊士的政綱政策，像一個大雜貨攤，凡是今天美國的施政，有一點一滴被人認爲不滿意的，都紀錄下來，成爲進步黨主張改革的政綱。用一句中國成語來表達，就叫做「唱反腔」，華萊士的新聞電影，在戯院中被很多人喝彩鼓掌，就因爲這個道理！</p>
<p>舉個例說，美國的移民律，對付亞洲人特別規定的移民律，是我們中國人一向不滿意的。但是從來就沒有共和黨，或者民主黨的政綱政策裏，提到過改善中國移民的苛則，唯有這個華萊士的進步黨，具體提到的。在進步黨的宣言衷，還提倡人民健康保險，主張食物管制，取消限制勞工利益的勞工法，重工業國營，打倒托辣斯，也提到憲法保障共產黨的自由活動權利，主張廢除國會中的特種調査統計委員會。</p>
<p>正就是這個時候，杜魯門總統打破歷史成規，召集了一次國會特別會議，由於一位共產國際女間諜班特萊的自首，鬧出了所謂轟動世界的間諜案。美國會的特種調査委員會（原名該譯爲不忠於美國者調査委員會）不但不被華萊士所輕視，而且權力超天，正在施展美國行政機構上少見的威力。班特萊女士，在國會特種委會的調査庭上，指認華萊士的左右手——潘羅和考勒爾，都是蘇聯的間諜，潘羅從前經華萊士提拔，在戰時生產局任職，現在是華萊士的助選幹事。班特萊說他曾經盜竊戰時生產局的統計，報吿莫斯科。班特萊還說；大政論家李普曼，從前有一位私人女秘書也是共產黨，班特萊曾和這位女共產黨，偸抄過李普曼的機密資料。這位女共產黨，現在在南加羅里那州，做華萊士進步黨州黨部的書記長。另外一位美國時代週刋的編輯張伯斯，聽到班特萊的「供狀」之後，也趕到華盛頓國會調査委員會作證。張伯斯從前當過共產黨，很早退出了的。張伯斯說：華萊士的幹部健將之一，普萊斯曼和他的太太索菲亞，都是百分之百的共產黨。普萊斯曼從前當美國總工會的秘書，他辭掉了一萬九千美金年薪的秘書不幹，替華萊士做競選幹事，。進步黨在費城開成立大會的時候，普萊斯曼是宣言起草委員會的書記，他老婆索菲亞，是婦女界助選華萊士的負責人，</p>
<p>前幾天，美國的國家特務偵探，闖進了紐約公園路三十九號華萊士的「中央黨部」，翻箱倒篋，做了一次大搜査，這一下，可把那位六十歲的「大思想家」氣壞了。華萊士這幾天，連續作了好幾次演說，他說：共和黨操縱下的國會，正在製造一次歷史上空前未有的「恐怖時代」。美國人民應該一致起來抗議共和黨國會的「暴行！」，「爲維護美國憲法的尊嚴，爲爭取人身自由的權利，我們要向共和黨國會抗議！」</p>
<p>華萊士的抗議沒有回響，相反的，間諜案牽連愈來愈擴大，甚至弄到莫洛托夫在一莫斯科「大光其火」，潘友新大使淸早六點鐘，跑到美國國務院抗議。美蘇關係正在懸崖絕壁上行進，這將使美國千百萬選民，對於主張華萊士親蘇聯共的「進步黨」又有些什麽印象？</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕作戰期間任中國派遺軍總司令言之頭號日本戰犯岡村寗次大將，昨日由軍事法庭偕市參議會禮堂舉行公審，中外各界首長等七百餘人，旁聽滿座。上午自九時三十分至十二時，下午自三時至六時三十分，除審問岡村寗次並傳訊業已判罪之日軍師旅團長落合甚九郞等四人作證外，檢察官與辯護律師各就其立塲展開激烈之辯論。庭上因本案爲審判戰犯以來最重大之一案，爲特別鄭重起見，宣吿改期鐵審，俾可詳細研究，而達於不杆不縱。再審之日期俟決定後另行公吿。</p>
<p>昨晨八時許，岡村寗次及證人二十七師團長落合甚九郞，一一六師團長菱田原四郞，五十五旅團長梨岡壽男，長沙警備司令船引正之等五人，即由軍事法庭派員自戰犯監獄押解到庭。市參議會大門口及三樓法庭中警憲林立，戒備森嚴。九時半準時開庭，庭長石美瑜。審判官陸起·張體坤·葉在增·林健鵬·撿察官施泳（担任上午起訴部份），主任檢察官王家楣（担任下午辯論部份），書記官丁象庵，通譯官王仁明·黄文政·羅滌。辯護人江一平·楊鵬·錢龍生。首提岡村寗次，身穿軍便服，翻領白襯衫，精神較上次調査庭時爲佳。庭上調査年齡籍貫履歷後，賜岡村就座，由檢察官宣讀起訴書。讀畢，石庭長開始發問，岡村從容答覆。渠對於庭長所問發動侵華之罪魁是否土肥原一點，答稱不知道，因該時在陸軍省人事科服務，對於發動侵華戰事及大東亞政策均未參與。渠供稱，此大概係少壯派軍人之起意，而渠本人則爲少壯派之前輩。七七蘆溝橋事變起至日軍攻入南京時，渠始終在哈爾濱任第二師團長，至武漢會戰時始奉調參加，祖任十一軍司令官，統率四個師團。珍珠港事變時，又轉調北平任業北司令官。三十三年十一月二十六日奉令升任派遣軍總司令，十二月二日接事，至投降爲止。在此八個月內其任務爲防止東海岸美軍登陸，將湘贛內地之部隊調集京滬，故在中國境內無大規模之戰事。當時日本軍隊除東北台灣越南者外，其餘均受其管轄。對於二十三軍田中久一中將所部自黔桂撤退時將柳州焚城，及二十七師團長落合甚九郞等所部屠殺平民等罪行均未知悉。渠就任總司令官後曾下令部下防止犯罪行爲，對於受害之中國人，渠代表日本人民甚感抱歉，惟不承認應負共犯責任，因師團長上級有軍司令官及方面軍司令官，然後始達到總司令官。</p>
<p>傳訊證人　船引正之聲辯</p>
<p>至此庭上傳證人落合甚九郞，菱田元四郞，船引正之，（以上三人均因縱容部屬屠殺搶刧，判處無期徒刑），及梨岡壽男（破壞財產及搶劫，判處徒刑十五年）。其中船羄正之要求發言，庭上允准，船引正之乃自懷中探出預寫之長篇文章，朗聲宣讀，大意稱岡村曾囑其應嚴肅軍紀，並印有「澈底愛民」訓詞之印刷品分發軍中早晚宣讀。岡村又修改軍中法律，將强姦罪定爲毋須告訴乃論，犯者處死刑。凡此種種，均可證明岡村不應負共犯之責任。船引正之繼復爲其太身被判之罪聲辯，庭上因其發言時間太長，乃囑其暫停，俟下午再說。</p>
<p>日本投降後情形</p>
<p>於是繼續部岡村寗次在日本投降後之情形。岡村供稱：其時日本在華軍隊大約有一百萬左右，投降後並無違抗命令行爲，惟曾與新四軍作戰，死傷一萬餘人，因新四軍擬來繳械，渠下令除中央軍外，不得將軍械交與其他部隊。此外投降時又有不明番號之部隊擬接收南京，渠爲維持治安，亦曾與之開火。以上兩事曾報吿中國軍事當局，認爲處置甚爲得當。此後渠担任日本官兵善後聯絡班理長，辦理回國及留用事宜。去年十月起患肺病，迄今未痊。</p>
<p>庭長詢問　對華觀感</p>
<p>石庭長繼又詢以對於日本軍閥侵略中國世界的政策有何感想次個人對華觀感如何？岡村謂：關於侵華，渠在少年時即根本不同意，但因軍人以服從爲天職，奉大本營命令不得不來。東亞之安定必賴頰中國之繁榮，故於投降後曾下令部下盡力協助中國政府。</p>
<p>下午開庭，船引正之爲其本身罪行繼續聲辯畢，庭上允被吿辯護人江一平律師之請求，由江律師直接詢問各證人關於日軍之編制及軍風紀責任問題。結論爲總司令官負戰略調度之責，各師團軍風紀則由聯隊長大隊長中隊長分層負責，而由師國長總其成。總司令官可以調動師團長，但無權將師團長免職。</p>
<h3>檢察官列舉　五項論據　被告對於戰爭罪行　未盡防範制止能事</h3>
<p>繼即開始辯論，先由主任檢察官王家楣發言，渠列舉五項論據：（一）起訴書中所述之理由，被吿對於其所屬部隊到處肆施屠殺搶劫及破壞財產，事前旣不加以防範，事後又未迅予制止，依照戰爭罪犯審判條例第九條之規定應負共犯責任。（二）第九條之條文爲「處於監督指導地位，對於戰爭罪行未盡防範制止之能事者，按共犯論。」被吿爲派遣軍總司令，當然處於監督指導地位。抗戰以來日軍罪行不可勝數，被吿早應知道，就任總司令官後雖說曾下令防範，但事實上仍有罪行，可見未盡能事。（三）被吿答辯謂僅對國家戰略方面負責，但其執行之戰略爲侵略戰，出發點已錯誤，而被吿担任總司令官後，仍瘋狂進攻黔桂，打通粤漢南路，竄擾豫南鄂北，應負破壞和平之罪。（四）審判戰犯並非意氣用事，非對日本軍隊或個人施以報復，而是對侵略國加以懲處，使以後再無侵略戰爭，保障世界和平。（五）本庭起訴被告，僅擇其部下之罪蹟昭彰而有確實證據者，實則被吿在任總司令官以前已在華作戰，其罪豈僅止此。惟被吿在投降時協助我政府接收軍隊，對我國局勢不無微功，故希望庭長量罪課刑，持以平衡。</p>
<h3>辯護人駁復兩點　請庭上宣判無罪</h3>
<p>辯護人駁復檢察官之立論者，首爲江一平律師，渠就起訴要旨所根據之戰犯審判條例第九條之條文中「處於指揮監督地位」及「未盡能事者」兩點加以分析論述，認爲（一）被吿担任總司令官，若言指揮，固可達到遙遠之處，監督則應層層負責，經各級軍官始能達到士兵。（二）即使被吿有兩種責任，亦應視其是否已盡防範制止之能事。據證人所述，被告曾吿誡部下不得擾民，有不殺不燒不犯三項標語，並曾印刷愛民文吿，發令軍中遵守，又曾將强姦罪之吿訴乃論取消，以重其刑，凡此種種，均顯示被吿對防制罪行已盡其能事。試問被吿爲發號施令之總司令官，除口頭及書面訓令外，尙有何法可執行其職權？因此被告確已盡其能事，至於結果如何則非被吿所應負責。（三）罪犯之審判，應以證據爲重。不能因被吿具有總司令官大將身份，即課以罪刑。發動侵華戰爭之少壯派現尙有倖免於法網之外，正犯抓不到，僅因被吿是總司令官而辦之，如此不但使正犯竊笑，且使法律尊嚴盡失。今被吿有種種反證提出，爲世道人心國際觀瞻及維持和平起見，請庭上宣判被吿無罪。</p>
<p>其他兩辯護人錢龍生及楊鵬律師亦先後爲被吿辯護。錢律師認爲被告僅負戰略責任，指揮屬於大本營，監督應由陸軍大臣負責。而日軍所犯屠殺等種種罪行均係偶然而非有計劃之行爲，被吿對於偶發事件實無從制止。楊律師則就審判戰犯之政策問題論述，亦請庭上對被吿宣判無罪。</p>
<h3>盡能事與否　為辯論焦點</h3>
<p>繼檢察官與江一平律師再度起立辯論。檢察官謂：所謂「盡能事」，盡的程度有上下。被告眞能貫澈軍令，未始不能防止。被吿對於日軍種種罪行推說不知，實爲自欺欺人。希望庭上拿出勇氣來公平審判，否則若僅做做機子，宣告無罪，則何以對受難的百姓？辯護人江一平則謂：所謂盡能事，是的確已盡，抑或敷衍的問題。自法的立塲言，岡村除發佈命令吿誡部下外，尙有何法始可謂盡職？試問岡村吿誡部下難道是準備今日開庭時作爲證據？法律上如有證據，自應判罪，但不能因被吿爲總司令官，無界亦判其有罪。故仍請庭上以不寬大不報復的立塲公平判決。</p>
<p>此時已爲六時三十分，庭長宣佈爲鄭重起見，不能草草一庭審結，決定暫吿一段落，改期再審，被吿及證人還押。</p>
<h3>放款新利率仍高　工業界認為不當</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕記者頃訪工業界某有資格人土，彼對政府此次毅然改革幣制，及各種經濟措施，均極表擁護。惟對前日銀錢信託三業決定之放款利率，月息高達一角五分，而戰前行莊拆息最高未超過一分五厘一點，認爲當局現正致力抑平物價，一切謀使恢復戰前標準，利息竟高達十倍，殊覺不宜，對今後物價必有嚴重影饗。戰時及戰後高利貸之產生，係基於惡性通貨膨脹，今幣制改革，金圓券發行有嚴格限制，通貨信用恢復，物價穩定，若利息仍如此高昂，實無理由。高利貸對工業界尤爲不利，直接影響貨品製造成本，故望政府及早注意，取締高利貸款，同時開放工貸，扶助工商業，增加生　，始能使物價穩定，否則恐難收成效。</p>

<h3>財次徐柏園返京　行前視察造幣廠</h3>
<p>財次徐柏園氏，日前由京來滬，逕與有關當局就推行新經濟改革方案中各項措施交換意見，並數度出席重要會議，茲因公畢，已於廿三日搭乘夜車返京。徐氏行前，並於下午六時親赴中央造幣廠視察。據悉該廠奉令鑄製之輔幣，除鎳幣中兩角，一角，五分三種，已製造完竣，陸續運赴各重要城市外，本市日內即可大量應市。其餘一分鋼幣及五角銀幣亦正在籌製中，預計一二月內即可全部竣工。</p>
<h3>收兌外幣金銀　銀行應接不睱　央行行員通宵辦公　總收若干今可公佈</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕中央銀行及其他委託銀行昨日開始收兌外幣黄金及銀幣，成績之佳，出人意外。因收兌數量之多，至深晚十時，不惟央行本身部份未結淸，若干受委託銀行之原始資料，且尙未彙齊送交。央行業務局人員均通宵辦公，結束當日之工作。據談午夜之後，方能結算完竣；數字雖不敢輕予估計，但可保證相當可觀。此項統計數字，今日可正式發表。</p>
<p>昨日開始收兌時，外幣部份除由央行直接收兌外，並委託中國·交通·中農·麥加利·大通五家代爲收兌。黄金部份，除央行外，並委託中國。交通·農民三行之信託部代收，銀幣則暫由中央銀行直接收兌。上午九時開始收兌時，中央。中國兩行內即人山人海，擁擠不堪，因管理人員之指導，排成行列，順次而進，秩序大體尙佳。迄傍晚時，據一般估計，央行收兌之銀幣約在三萬元以上，黄金約爲一萬兩；美鈔之收兌，央行方面上午約爲六萬美金，午後超過此數；中國銀行信託部亦收兌十五萬左右美金，外商銀行不詳。以類別而論，黄金收兌最多，其次爲外幣，再次爲銀元。出售黄金者，大部爲急需頭寸之行莊，單筆交易有多至金條二三十根者。中國信託部之收兌工作昨日限於外幣，除發現假鈔票一起外，其他均甚順利，因擠兌者太多，檢鈔手續甚煩，不得不限制爲四百名，往兌者頗多鵠候終日，僅恃乾糧果腹者。以數額論，一二百元者爲大宗，間有高至三四萬者，但一共兩筆交易而已。據記者實地調査，往兌者之動機，不外兩種，一爲平日業務不甚健全之行莊，急於調度頭寸，不得不將平日珍藏之金鈔，忍痛割愛；二爲收兌金鈔之價格，已與黑市一致，而其他商品之批發物價，如棉紗龍頭細布等，已低於幣制改革前之價格，平日以金鈔爲籌碼之商賣，不願將頭寸擱置不用，故自願拋出易取金圓券，以便補進其他貨物。不論在何種情形之下，央行均有機會兌進大量之金銀外幣，以充實新幣之準備基金。</p>
<h3>社局吳局長　巡視各市場　曉諭市場管理員　務遵八一九定價</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕社會局吳局長昨最偕經濟行政處長顧炳元，巡視全市各市塲，限令各項日用物品不得超越本月十九日之市價，違者予以嚴厲處罰。昨晨因時間迫促，僅視察麵粉·油·糖·及南北米市塲，每至一市塲，即召該市塲管理人員加以曉諭，務須確運本月十九日市價標準，不得任意抬高，幷稱：如有違反規定，超過規定價格進行買賣者，除買賣雙方均子處罰外，市塲管理人員亦負連帶責任。</p>
<p>社局昨通知全市各同業公會，將本月十九日各項物品價格抄表送交該局，以備査考。幣制改革令頒布後，漲風最烈者爲蔬菜，鮮肉。社局爲戢止暴漲，定於今日上午十時，召集蔬菜，鮮肉，牛羊，鷄鴨，地貨，魚市塲各業負責人談話，上午十一時召集百貨業負責人談話，囑各該業自動將抬高之價格降低，否則即予嚴懲。屆時幷邀有關機關警察，財政，衛生各局代表參加。</p>
<p>將在各市場　張貼價格表</p>
<p>昨晨菜市又有波動，社局自今日起將在各市塲張貼價格表，表明八月十九日各物價格，折合金圓券，超越此價者予以處罰，市民可隨時向警察檢舉，吊銷其執照。</p>
<p>經警昨出動　屠夫受警告</p>
<p>市警局昨晨出動全體經濟警察，分赴南北米市塲，紗布市塲，燃料市塲，及各日用品市塲，監視交易，並會同各分局員警赴各商店各菜塲調査其售價有否超出十九日之價格。一般情形均甚良好，惟菜市塲價格仍極混亂，寗海中路二二六號張姓屠夫，以抬高肉價被捕，其他尙有菜販十餘人，由黄捕分局拘捕予以警吿</p>

<h3>銀樓業繁榮　收兌金飾忙</h3>
<p>金圓券發行之第一日，本市各大銀樓廿三日營業突趨繁忙。據裘天寳經理稱：各銀樓多爲收進金飾，鮮有售出者，蓋一般人民以爲一兩金飾兌換金圓券一百九十圓，並不吃虧，因此需要現鈔者，均紛紛往銀樓兌換。</p>
<h3>澈底執行緊急方案　打倒經濟戰場敵人　蔣經國向戡建大隊官佐演講</h3>
<p>奉命來滬協助督導實施經濟改革方案之蔣經國氏，昨對戡建大隊官佐講演，針對當前經濟緊急改革處理工作，有所指示。略謂：此項政策首應發動廣大羣衆，自動參加執行，並獲得社會人士之擁護與合作，方能有效貫澈，蓋後方經濟戰塲上之敵人，如投機囤積，操縱物價，以及宣贓枉法之徒，其罪懇實與前方戰塲上之敵人無異，欲使改革政策發生效果，更須運用社會的力量，發動與論的制裁，加以澈底之消滅。次謂法律之前，人人平等，愈是有錢有勢的人，一旦犯了國法，愈要加重懲處，而對於正當的工商業者，必須予以切實的保獲。茲誌其要點如次：</p>
<p>消滅後方敵人　收得完善效果</p>
<p>總統最近所頭佈的財政經濟緊急處分令，是安定社會秩序，改善人民生活的重要政策，這個政策，在應付當前經濟局勢，是必要而且正確的，它不僅關繫着每個人的切身生活問題，而且足以決定整個國家和民族的生死存亡，所以擁護這個政策，就是擁護國家的利益，就是保護人民大衆自己的利益，反對這個政策，就是反對國家的利益，也就是帮助了人民的公敵。政策旣定之後，就應切實的澈底的去執行，在執行過程中，必須注意兩點：第一是政府的一切措施，應以大多數人民的利益爲利益，並且必須發動廣大的羣衆來參加執行，祗有如此，才能使政策加速生效，而獲得成功的保證，因爲在前方軍事戰塲上的敵人，是共匪，大家對於他的暴行罪惡，都是有目共見的，而後方經濟戰塲上的敵人—像那些投機囤積，操縱物價，貪贓枉法的商人和官吏，却不易爲人所察覺，然而他們的罪惡，實與奸匪無異，所不同的，祗是盜匪的殺人越貨是有形的，而奸商汚吏的殺人放火是無形的。我們上海富有正義感的市民，更應認淸後方敵人的眞面目，共同起來制裁他們，消滅他們，我們認爲大規模的國民經濟之鬥爭，僅靠政府的力量是不够的，一定還要充分運用社會的力量，尤其民衆的力量，才能澈底消滅後方的敵人，而收得完善的效果。</p>
<p>犯法的要嚴辦　守法的予保護</p>
<p>其次政府的派令，必須要人民共同遵守，無論何人，在法律前面應當一律平等，我深深的感覺到，在過去眞正守法的，多是那些窮苦的百姓，而一般有錢有勢的人，則往往逍遙法外，爲所欲爲。上海人說「有條才有理」，所謂條，是指金條，理就是道理，所謂「有條有理」的意思，就是說有了金條，就是道理，這種黑暗的現象，是造成今天社會黑白不分，是非不明的主要原因，我們必須澈底的加以剷除。在上海應當做到不管你有多少的財富，有多大的勢力，一旦犯了國法，就得毫不容情的請你進監獄，上刑塲，那才能伸正義，張國法，使一般人民心悅誠服。但是，犯法的要嚴辦，而對於守法自愛的工商人士，我們却必須充分予以保護，使工商業得能正常的發展和繁榮。</p>
<p>切實負起責任　共謀經濟安定</p>
<p>我們合天不能再粉飾太平了，而當老老實實的承認，今天國家和人民的處境，已到了最危險，最痛苦的地步。我們高俸厚祿的官吏，此時應該深自省悟，並且把握時機，竭盡所有的心力，來爲國家與人民努力服務。俗語說得好：「吃誰的飯，做誰的事」，我們旣吃了人民的飯，就當爲人民做事，至於人民本身，亦應當明瞭今天是國家存亡的最後關頭，祗有大家一心一德，團結一致，共同守法，以最大的忍耐，作最善的努力，才能挽回危局。</p>
<p>上海的環境是複雜的，工作不易做好，但我相信祗要不怕權勢的壓迫，金錢的誘惑，就不會有做不通的事。</p>
<p>回想抗戰時期的艱苦與危險，再看國家今天所遭遇的痛苦，不得不令人發生無限的感慨，我們國家和人民的痛苦，實在太深重了，但是一切窮苦的運命，祗有在堅忍奮鬥中，才能轉危爲安，轉憂爲樂，轉苦爲甘，轉黑暗爲光明。像抗戰這樣偉大的事業，已經在總統領導之下，得到了勝利，像日本這樣强大的敵人，亦在總統領導之下，被我們所打倒，則今天的戡亂戰事，難道不能圓滿完成嗎？誠然，今天已不是推諉責任，逃避責任，或互相責難的時候了，而是要大家加强信心，遵守法紀，擁護國策，來切實的負起責任，共謀國民經濟生活的安定，才能完成戡亂建國的大業。</p>
<h3>「擠兌」發生意外　轉瞬缺少千圓　究意誰應負責</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕昨日央行收兌黄金時，有某公司派一年事甚輕之職員，持價値七千金圓之黄金收兌，離櫃台後，突發現短缺一千金圓之鉅，當時大驚失色，急與承兌人員交涉，經辦者告以人旣離櫃，行方自難負責，惟允於夜間結賬時核算，如多出一千圓時，則可能爲忙中之誤，可予補足。惟迄晚淸賬時，並未發現多餘，而此職員因責任關係，迄晚尙未敢離開兌換地點，將來究如何解決，尙待今日分解云。</p>
<h3>美領告誡同仁　協力推行新幣制　白吉爾亦表示讚揚</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕美駐滬總領事葛柏德，以我國推行新幣制，爲表示充份合作起見，昨特對領館全體同仁，頒發備忘錄，剴切曉諭，務須注意通力合作。葛氏特別指出二點：（一）任何同仁，非經合法機構，不得以美金購進金圓劵。（二）任何同人，如無正當用途，不得使用美元。</p>
<p>〔又訊〕駐滬美海軍總部發表，美西太平洋艦隊司令白吉爾海軍中將，廿三日就中國改革幣制發表聲明稱：中國此舉，有益於外匯現狀之改善。復稱：渠已下令所屬機構之美海軍人員，一體遵行。</p>

<h3>計算工資技術問題　評斷會定日內討論　谷部長公畢昨晚返京</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕社會局長吳開先，昨宴因公蒞滬之社會部長谷正綱。副局長趙班斧及各處長作陪，席間曾就工資問題向谷部長請示。據谷部長稱：幣制改革後之工資發薪標準，中央頒布之整理財政及加強管制經濟辦法第廿二條中已有明白規定，社會部對此亦無任何補充辦法，至於技術上枝節問題，應由市勞資評斷會洽商處理。嗣各人均提出意見，本市各業職工待遇，除按本期指數發薪者外，尚有依上期指數，或上期與本期平均指數發薪者，亦有工資底薪過高折扣後發薪者，其他如加工，停工，减工，件工等如何計算之技術問題，互相交換意見，討論頗爲詳盡，惟迄未作具體結論。所有各項問題，社局定於二三日內召開勞資評斷會討論。</p>
<p>社會部谷部長，來滬業已公畢，昨晚返京。</p>

<h3>東北三顆強心丸</h3>
<p>— 本報特派員　韓清濤</p>
<p>〔本報錦州十六日航訊〕去年，冬天裏的大雪，給東北穿上了喪衣，幾乎叫沉重的病人，停止了血脈循環，窒息了氣息。今年，春來的時候，帶給了病人一些起死回生的活力，一年來的蘇息，穏定，又從新走上求生的通路。假如秋天不使它失去培養元氣的力量，冬天不使它斷喪身體，在穩定喪求開展，那就越發有救了。一切挽回輩運的法幣，在乎中央決定了造成「三顆強心丸」的政策，這三顆強心丸，就是放棄不重要據點，集中力量，固守瀋陽，錦州，長春，三大據點，使它充分發揮強心劑作用。</p>
<p>三顆強心丸政策成功了，主治醫師是東北剿匪總司令衛立煌將軍，同時他有一個熟練的助手，那就是參謀長趙家驤，使東北益起沉疴，剿總政務委員會，更在政治和經濟上，起着很大的效力。</p>
<p>目前，東北正開始着軍事，政治，經濟，配合一致的總體戰，希望在衰弱中打開一條生路。</p>
<p>兩港一條綫</p>
<p>葫蘆烏給東北吞進了糧食，麵粉，也給東北吐出了換錢的鋼鐵和特殊的物產，同時陸軍在這裏登陸，在這裏上船，支援關內外，發揮着進出攻守作用。海軍游弋渤海，也從這裏駛到遼東灣，最近的砲姦營口，並有一支勁旅，開到了葫蘆息一帶，於是又盛傳國軍將登陸營口，打開遼南通路，這是可能成爲事實的消息，因爲胡蘆鳥營口，是東北的兩個咽喉。</p>
<p>爲了打通潘陽和關內的聯擊，以登陸營口最有利，最捷便，若要打通錦州潘陽間的鐵路，困難比較多，何况打通了又難守呢。當然，肅淸遼南，守衛潘營路綫，也得要用許多兵力。</p>
<p>北寗路是東北和關內聯在一起的一條綫，這條綫，潘陽到錦州是被切斷了。錦州到關內，則暢通無阻，瀋錦間綫的打通尙有待，目前正由空中馬達負起了聯絡斷綫的任務，雖然載重少，但四十五分鐘的空中航程，是很便捷的，這支空中勁旅聯絡着綫，同時也在東北汪洋大海般的面上振翼翱翔。</p>
<p>生路在遼西</p>
<p>遼西走廊，自古爲兵家爭取勝利的戰塲，他們在這裏灑過血汗，將士在這裏消磨過好時光，唐詩：「打起黃鶯兒，莫呌枝上啼，啼時驚妾夢，不得到遼西」，就是想思遼西戰士的吟咏。</p>
<p>今年，國罩牢固的把握着遼西走廊，發揮着很大的聯繫作用，進攻，固守，都可運用自如，同時胡產蠢港口，北寗路綫，都是東北生路所在。</p>
<p>東北剿總錦州指揮所主任范漢傑將軍，在這裏坐鎭，遼西走廊，翼東東端，包括着秦皇烏，都由着他指揮的重兵護衛着，他小心地利用這塊基地，作爲出擊的準備。</p>
<p>孫渡把來自蕓南的兵團大權，移交給原九十三軍軍長盧濬泉後，新升任兵團司令官的盧濬泉，正在勤求進步，振奮士氣，希望把這支鷹大隊伍使之更有力量，努力，勤奮，是會有代價的。</p>
<p>在政治上，遼寗省府特在這裏設置了一個「遼西行署」，由着行署主任賀奎（兼冀熱遼邊區剿匪副司令）推行政務，錦市，錦縣，養縣，錦西，興城，綏中，都聽命於遼西行署，賀奎說：「我是遼西軍民間的橋樑」。</p>
<p>東北剿總政務委員會，爲了加强遼西政治，經濟和軍事上的配合，特派一個頭問魏鏗，在錦設辦事處，好能順利的執行東北總體戰。高梁肥，大豆香，今秋，遼西將有一個好收成！</p>
<p>冀東，是和遼西聯在一起的，匪由熱東出入畏城，打算切斷關內外北寗路的交通。八月裏，冀東掃蕩戰，獲得勝利，收復遷安，盧龍，遵化，迫匪遠離，受到傷亡，匪的企圖，完全粉碎。</p>
<p>如此，北寗路開內關外段，越發可以暢通無阻，加上秦皇鳥，葫簾爲，發揮吞吐力量，錦州，瀋陽，可以越發打成一片，如果營口收復，遼南打通，局勢更可大爲改觀。</p>
<p>長春，隔絕，孤懸，但東北剿匪副總司令鄭洞國，不使圍攻之匪，更進市區一步，他率領着約計兩軍多人，還有人民，忍譏，受難，保衛着市區，發揮很大的牽制匪之實力作用。</p>
<p>坦平光明路</p>
<p>東北國軍兵力，據估計約有三十萬人，大約瀋陽周遭有八個軍，遼西和冀東東部，約有五個軍，長春約有兩個軍，潘·長多爲精軍，遼西多爲新生力量。</p>
<p>匪方林彪，擁有一·二·三·四，五·六·七·八·九·十·十一·十二縱隊（裏面的第五和第十二縱隊，有無尙待考證）的野戰軍和幾個獨立的師和國，另有蒙騎，回民，韓共等支隊，加上地方武力，號稱五十萬衆，實際數字，尙難判明。</p>
<p>林彪，把大部匪軍，擺在遼北，從事整補，訓練，半年多沒有調動，運用。除了有些不敢動的內在原因外，那就是把許多窮鄕僻壤，已經吃得山窮水盡，所以不得不在素有「東北糧庫」之稱的遼北長期吃用了。</p>
<p>現在，匪方極端缺乏彈藥，食糧，所以東北匪不動則已，動，要在高糧熟了。動，要在有機可乘，好來解決補給問題，好來找便宜。九月中，秋收後，吃，槍，行動，到處方便，恐怕那就是匪開始竄擾的時候。</p>
<p>國軍，蓄精養銳，不輕易出擊，不變動「三點政策」，使匪無隙可擊，無機可乘。目前課題，是如何保證秋收，挨過冬天，接着迎接一個活潑的春天。</p>
<p>東北大局，主要的還是維持現狀，一切在穩定中求開展。今年，還有秋收後和冰雪中兩重難關，過此，道路將益趨坦平光明。</p>

<h3>常熟公園橋牌案　警局長與大學生　激辯兩小時</h3>
<p>〔本報常熱廿日訊〕本縣頃因警察局强行干涉上海來常實翌之大學生作「橋牌」（Bridge）戲而開出一幕怪劇。此間各報，供以極顯著地位，登載洋洋千言的特寫，分析此「案」經過，一時與新幣問題同成爲街頭巷尾談話資料。</p>
<p>緣有上海聖約翰大學工學院學生廿餘人，於週前來常賣習測勘，協助建設工作。廿日，測量西外環山馬路初步工作，業已完成，遂羣集中山公園，品茗間坐，並作「橋牌」戲，以爲娛遣。不料因此驚動園警，報吿警局，認爲有人在公共塲所公然聚衆賭博，於是派出巡官，率領大批警士到塲兜捕。抵達後，因爲學生不承認打「橋牌」是犯罪行爲，並一再申明翻遍中外法典，從未有規定Bridge玩者作現行犯辦理的明文。所以只肯推派代表二人隨同向局長解釋。到局後，二學生申述橋牌與象棋等性質相同，竭力解釋誤會，但黃局長却始終認爲衆學生雖釆賭博，總算構成「類似賭博」行爲，應于拘禁七日的處分，姑念達法者係大學生，免予追究。但學生代表認爲根本未犯法，對局長之「免予追究」，拒絕接受。於訊問筆錄上簽名時，並註明不承認被視作「現行犯」。歷二小時之激辯，雙方各執一詞，未有結果，最後局方裁定將紙牌銷燬，學生不服，表示準備依法提行政訴訟。今後本案發展，至堪矚目。</p>

<h3>五棓子　登場時節</h3>
<p>— 本報記者　劉孟痴</p>
<p>〔本報貴陽廿日航訊〕貴州特產一種寄生於野生植物上的工業原料，遍地皆是，不施人工，它可以作近代有機化學工業藥品，醫藥品，有機染料的種種用途，其經濟價値還過於現在已爲國人所極重視的「貴州美菸」，它的名字叫做「五棓子」。</p>
<p>它寄生在一種野生的叫做「　膚木」的植物上，是蚜虫在寄居後所結成的一種虫　。所謂「鹽膚木」，屬漆樹科，生於滇黔山野間，落葉喬木，華高一二丈，葉爲奇數的羽狀複業，長尺許，小葉作長卵形，其總葉柄，在小葉間有翼，夏季梢頭開綠白色小花，結小核果，密生紫色及白色之短毛，至成熟時，則蚜虫聚集，抹佈鹽樣之粉末於業面及葉背，築成其奇居之巢，漸漸形成瘤狀小塊，成熟後呈赤褐色，大小不一，它就是我們所常呼的「五棓子」。這種野生植物所以叫做「鹽膚木」的原因，明代李時珍在其所著之「本草綱目」上有云：「其味齣，故有是」又云：「核外薄皮上有薄鹽，小兒食之，滇蜀人探爲木鹽」。</p>
<p>戰前統計　獨居首位</p>
<p>貴州各縣，尤其是接近蕓南，四川的地方，山野間遠地皆是，戰前鄕人雖不十分知道它的用途，但因見有人收購，也就順便採摘，運至城中求售，雖價錢很賤，亦可補助農村家用。據戰前的世界統計：五棓子產量，我國居第一位，日本佔第二位。就我國各省來說，又以黔滇兩省的產量爲最大。因爲鹽厲木對於土壤和氣候的選擇性是很大的滇黔高原的農曆六七月，正値印度洋的季風將水分吹落滇黔兩省境內，所以氣候潮濕，最適於鹽膚木的生長。到了夏末秋初，正是蚜虫繁殖的時機黔滇兩省漫山遍野都生長有鹽膚木，都結有大量的五棓子。海禁未開以前，一般鄕人只知道五棓子是一種並不貴重的獎品，迨至通商發埠以後，日本商人及德國商人到我國來大量收講五棓子的時候，鄉人才知道五棓子是很値錢的東西。</p>
<p>日德商人　收購回國</p>
<p>日德商人收購五棓子回國，製威成品之後，又運到我國來銷售，或向世界各國去銷售，其所獲利潤當在萬倍以上。那時我國因朱設有提煉的工廠，也沒有人肯從事於這一類化學工業的投資，所以完全靠國外的成品來使用，眼巴巴的看見別人賺錢。抗戰期間，國際通路被封鎖，我國需要激增，黃海化工社與軍政部，衛生署，訂製次沒食子酸械，需要沒食子酸來作配合藥劑，才開始研究利用五棓子來製造沒食子酸的過程。五培子在我國，方第一次由原料煉製成品。廠址設在四川的南川，爲便於隣近滇黔，易於收購五棓子，但因資本不敷，向農本同貸款辦理，後來業務不振，工作遂吿停頓。三十年春天，復請農民銀行接收辦理，續作小規模經營，以示倡導。製出來的成品，爲要表示與舶來品有別，乃爲之正名曰「棓酸」，而不用沒食十酸的譯名。</p>
<p>通常用途　約分三類</p>
<p>五桔子酸的用途很廣，大都用於照相，墨水，染色，造紙，醫藥，鑄銅印及石印，電鍍，釀酒等。據黃海化工社的報吿，最還常的用途可分爲三類：（一）有機化學工業藥品，如製造水，焦性倍酸，安息香酸等。（二）醫藥品，如製造倍酸甲脂，倍酸鋁，加羅福明，銘斯摩兒，次沒食子酸堿，埃羅耳等。（三）有機染料，如製造錢眉黃，茜素綠，倍酸亞泰藍等。</p>
<p>原料出口　成品進門</p>
<p>近年以來，棓酸在我國試製試銷的結果，甚爲滿意，即在重要一地，已有很好的銷塲，如慶華顏料廠，大公染織廠，大成染廠等是重慶最具規模的工廠，他們都大量採用，他如航空研究院的麂皮裂造廠，乃其他小型的製革廠，墨水廠等亦樂於購用。棓酸製成間世之後，也曾打算外銷，曾於川三年由復興公司專寄樣品與美國的世界貿易公司，去試探美國的銷路。是年冬天，接獲該公司復函，謂經化騐結果，較美國的一般品質略差，惟市塲尙可銷售，計當時約定在紐約交貨，每磅約値美金一元。卅五年，駐重慶之英商怡和洋行，曾將樣品寄英化騐，擬大量訂購運英精製，後因我廠中存貨有限，遂作罷論。外人對於我國的五棓子產銷情形，是非常注意的，這不是現在出了棓酸才如此。如前所述，日本人和德國人一向是在我國收購五棓子的，戰前他們每年在我國所收勝的至少在一百五十萬擔以上，價錢當然很賤，可是我們自家還要再以很高的價錢去把他們的成品買回來使用。</p>
<p>出路窒塞　大材洦沒</p>
<p>五棓子的產量在貴州近幾年來已逐漸减少了。原因是由於出路窒塞，無人加以蓄護，也不被人重視，那怕是生長在山野間，也是願其自生自滅，埋沒了如此的有用之材，眞是可惜！尤其是鄉農無知，依　壘守昔年刀耕火種的成法，春分以前，常常放火燒山，取草灰作肥料，闢燒塲作耕地，漫無限制的焚燬山林，燒死了蚜虫的種子，因而减少五棓子的產量。加以近幾年來，截亂軍事忙碌，運輸工具缺乏，運費又太高昻，五棓子的體積大，重量小，運輸時所佔的地位較大，一般舟車運輸都是以立方尺計算重量，而不以其實質計算，商人對於收購輸出五棓子的經濟價値，當然遠落在消耗品的美菸之後，乃至無人過問。這些時候，正當五棓子新貨登塲，市價新貨每百斤四千萬元，陳貨六千萬元，較之貴定美菸頂上金黃葉每百斤八百萬元次黃六百五十萬元，有經濟價値的東西反如此其賤，寗非怪事！</p>
<p>嚴禁燒山　設廠示範</p>
<p>五棓子是寄生於野生植物的有用物產，旣無須如美菸之經過勤苦的育苗移植施肥等艱苦工作，又富於國際性的經濟價値，更爲國家化學工業最需要的原料，是不應該聽其長此埋沒的。記者認爲政府當局至少懸該切實的做到「嚴蔡放火燒山」，使鄕人知道愛護鹽膚木及其上面的蚜虫，藉以增加五棓子產量。其次，應在貴州境內適當地區般小規模示範工廠，敎導晨民提練棓酸。</p>

<h3>金圓劵發行第一日　行莊擠滿提存客戶　金融圏內頭寸平穏業外略緊</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕昨日金員劵開始發行，各界以行莊連續休假三日，亟須提現，以共需用，故上午各行莊大多門庭若市，　滿提存之客戶，惟各行莊事前均已先作幣準備，對到期之放款，紛紛收團，故金融圈內頭寸甚屬平穩，而圈外各業，頭寸轉感緊俏，暗墨在六角左右。（以法幣計算）</p>
<p>票據交换結果，四行兩面一庫差出五〇三萬五千元，內中央銀行差出二八九萬九千元，大交換進四大三萬九千元，洋商進三九萬六千元，小交換軋平。中國出二二二萬元，交通入三三萬六千元，中晨出二二萬七千元，中言入五萬二千元，郵匯局出十二萬二千元，合作金庫入四萬五千元。昨日交换票據總張數五七萬張，交換總金額約九三三七萬元，均較前增加。又因昨日首次使用金圓支栗，各界錯誤累累，致退票亦獨多，全部軋算淸楚，已屆十一時云。</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕昨爲金圓券發行之第一日，外匯市塲頗爲安謐。進出口各界，以金圖券對外匯率已定，人心益趨平靜，並不如以往之急於結匯，故結匯額較以往爲少。全日以出口結匯證之吐售較多，初開金圓券三元三角三，惟以三元二角成交者最多。</p>
<p>指定銀行方面，以金圓券推行伊始，各種結匯手續，或有待改進之處，已決定於廿五日召開會議，商討一切云。</p>
<h3>人心穏定店胃薄弱　食米喊價平疲　粉糧油餅一致挫軟</h3>
<p>米市昨日恢復交易，市塲通吿價格一律以金圓爲標準，並規定不得逾十九日之價。昨市塲人心尙見穩定，米店納胃甚少。初市貨主喊價一律按照十九日之價，但因去路呆木，後市下疲，更因銀根奇緊，貨主吐售甚殺，致價格挫落。北市白粳二十元，薄早稻及羊秈均降一元光景，特高粳二十二元，則降七角。南市塲收市價亦降五六角，昨日二市到貨五七一七石。</p>
<p>麵粉挫洛，幣制改革後，人心甚穩，散戶及實銷均少染指，銷路較細，更因銀根突緊，使執貨者急於吐售，故收市價格更虛。老車開市七元二角五分，嗣因出戶接踵，進入七元之內，以六元八角五分收市，軋跌七角，兵船粉降六角，各跌一成光景，雜牌粉一致低六角或七角，麩皮開五元二角，計降三四角。</p>
<p>雜糧開始以金圓交易，惟一般人心甚爲穩定，客帮納意甚淡，銷路呆滯，惟因銀根緊俏，貨主售出甚多。黃豆初開開尙平，收市因油餅降多，收市跌五角，漢口乍豆退入十元內，蠶豆尙見平定，苞米，元麥，北帮不取，疾降一成以上，荼豆交易幾絕，紅糧未開出，芝蔴價疲化滯，生仁貨主喊價低一元，廣帮吃價低四元，致未成交。</p>
<p>食油恢復交易，但因實銷呆滯，去化不暢，更因銀根突緊，貨主售出甚多，價格因此下降。大有豆油四十九元，大昌新等爲四十八元五角，生菜油四十三元，各降三元五角，生油挫落五元三角，吉桶生油五十八元，小車蔴油五十元，計降五元。昨日交易不旺，市勢甚虛。豆餠吐納二寂，價挫五角。</p>
<h3>金管加緊工作　延長辦公時間</h3>
<p>上海金管局驗於改革幣制，加强經濟金融管制後，該局責任日益　　，尤其對於行莊增資存放利率，國家行局庫放款資金之運用等問題，非在推行之初，即加以嚴格管制與督導不易爲功。茲悉該局日來積極加緊工作，將辦公時間自本月廿三日起增加一小時，上午八時至十二時，下午二時至五時。並擴大組織，充實稽核員額，以赴事功。昨日已派大批人員分赴各行莊，監察有無限制提存及其他不妥情事云。</p>
<h3>國行扶助同業　特辦臨時拆款</h3>

<p>布價下降</p>
<p>昨日棉布市况，以幣制改革伊始，人心大都猶豫，壓力頗重，本客雨帮互有出總，散戶因利息仍高，爭先吐售。十二磅龍頭細布，初開在斬多情勢下，價即狂挫二成强，中途檯面帮哄抬微硬，不久因乘高拋售者多，回低至二十五元，（合法幣七千五百萬元）結束，較之十九日收價，軋降一成半許。四君子元嗶嘰在畏江帮競賣下，狂挫二成强，至其他各布，亦均軋小頗多，惟高檔士林布市較穩定，成交三千四百八十疋。</p>

<h3>我世運籃球隊　大勝伊拉克記　每半分鐘射中一球　英法各報大加贊揚</h3>
<p>— 本報特約記者　鐘震</p>
<p>〔本報倫敦航訊〕伊拉克籃球隊實力薄弱，雖以吾國任何大學監球隊來此，亦可獲利無疑。今日（八月六日）上午十時廿分在哈林蓋健身房，我國與該隊作戰，不出記者所料，以一百廿五對二十五分，創此次大會藍球新記錄。此戰因吾軍欲爭第二等級之名次，故諸隊員演出，賣力異常。今將比賽經過錄次：</p>
<p>（于瑞章）　黃天錫</p>
<p>吳成章　（賈志軍）</p>
<p>（吳成章）　蔡文華</p>
<p>李世僑　包松圓</p>
<p>開始時，中華隊仍以昨前作戰之五員猛將上塲，一待開球後，吾軍即以快速純熟之技術，接連射籃，十九中的。伊拉克無還手餘地。吾軍二衛黃黃天錫及包松圓，一旦將球奪到手後，即遠難與前鋒，頃刻問，銀笛一聲，又進一球。故在十分鐘內，獲分扶搖直上，成三十比六。以後數分鐘，因諸隊員氣力不逮，被伊拉克隊得數球，成三十比十，吾軍又急起進攻，以敏捷之動作，迅速進進球，尤以左鋒吳成軍，所擲進的球數，簡直不可數計，殺得伊拉克隊人仰馬翻，片甲不留，上半時結果，以五十四比十四結束。</p>
<h3>掌聲雷動　采聲不絕</h3>
<p>下半時易地再戰，指導因李世僑病後身體尙未復原，故以千瑞章掌左鋒，而吳成軍爲右鋒，賈志軍亦替代蔡文華。吾國隊自調遣球員後，實力更爲充足，連絡亦極默契，進球仍不計其數，以五十四比十四。上升至九十比十四，幾乎每半分鐘進一球。二隊如此相差實力作戰，實屬罕見。吾國點隊員的互相傳遞，精彩淸晰，射籃準確，兩旁看台上的限衆，掌聲雷動，暍采聲不絕。小小伊拉克隊射進數球，在最後十分鐘中，成一〇五對二十，此時吾軍戰局。作戰諸隊員，均汗流滿面，痰乏不堪。此次伊拉克隊對該組任何一隊比賽，均以百數計稱，但從未失一百廿五分之多。所以此間各報及巴黎日報紛紛登載中華隊作戰情形，讚揚吾國籃球隊的迅速和射藍準確，稱爲此次參加國家之冠。但身材短小，體力不建，實爲最大缺點。故今後吾國若注意國民體格，提倡運動，在下屆參加世運時，或有染指錦標的希望。</p>

<h3>中國窮不窮？</h3>
<p>— 則仕</p>
<p>如果我向你提出道個問題，你一定不假思索的回答：「豈有不窮之理！」然而仔細看看，仔細想想，我忍不住想說：中國才不窮哩！</p>
<p>不窮的證據之一，是上海女傭人的缺乏或居奇。報上常載晨村破產，鄉人競奔上海謀生，又說被兵之區災民　擁來滬。按理，在人浮於事之秋，這許多鄕民難民中之婦女，在人地生辣生活奇高的上海，做做傭人不失爲謀生之一法。而事實上薦頭店裏雖然坐滿了老老小小，工家人家想用她們一個到半年之久，即使你出足工錢，競競相待，也鹿異數。我家三年不用傭人，以後也不想用，故我出此言非爲自己發牢騷，而以目擊三個月來，同居人家的傭入新舊交替者幾及二十人之多，遂有感而云此。</p>
<p>從另一方面講，上海一般人旣與生活之難，而需求女備人却竟如此之股，股得使肯做的偶一不合即掛冠而去，決不戀棧，自視之高，高於機關首長。揆之供求之律，足見用得起女傭人者之多；大家用得起女傭人，又何足言窮！</p>
<p>不窮的另一證據，是一般商店住宅用電之浪費。一方面堅決反對加價，一方面却不知撙節，遂使西報振振有辭的說：難道叫將本謀利的公司，蝕了老本供你開着二百枝電燈打通宵馬將麽？上海一般用電之浪費，你如不信，睛一調査。</p>
<p>不窮的又一證據，是上海市財政局的捐款通知，據西報載，有人收到通知，須納捐四萬五千元法幣，而所用極漂亮的通知單信封與郵票，估計須二十四萬五千元，職工薪水之類尙不在內。</p>
<p>諸如此類，你可說至多是上海的一隅現象，大槪是如此。但除非上海人與上海機關是在五族以外的，否則以人言，上海人頗自命不凡或受城鄕人恭敬，以地言，上海還是國際觀　所擊，而竟如此的窮而不肯耐勞，窮而不知節儉，即使不足以代表整個民族的毛病，至少總有惡影饗於全國。</p>
<p>近來不知怎的常關心中國的命運，時發狂言，但願彼此無則加勉。</p>
<h3>舊京甜食</h3>
<p>— 翼雲</p>
<p>北平足令人留戀，係以氣候與飲食起居，均較舒適，食物方面，非徒五城各館子，均有可口餚點，即以市肆所售之各項甜食論，亦頗多精美之點，爲他處所莫及。惜近年經濟枯窘，物價日昂，已有大不如前之感。分述如次：</p>
<p>（一）蜜餞：計分乾濕二類，乾者如頻果，沙果，桃，杏，梨等脯，素爲平市出色之品，因其精選鮮果，顆顆完好，糖製成脯，又能純凈無滓，故香甜脆嫩，極爲悅口。今則多不如前，僅前門外聚順和，尙能保持昔時風味，但此舖其餘各物，亦不能如昔。濕者如炒紅果，蜜餞海棠，溫撲，靑梅，櫻桃等等，各建所藝，比昔均遜。</p>
<p>（二）甜餑餑：此爲北平各滿州餑餑舖特出之品，如薩其馬，芙蓉糕，大小八件，油糕，自來白（月餅），鮮花攻瑰餅，鮮花藤　餠等等，現時僅有前門外老聚豊蕭，及東四牌樓瑞芳驚，出品尙可；前門外正明齋，聚慶齋次之；其餘則等之自部。昔時此等舖子，以奶油蜂蜜饀之各種翻主（即各餑餑之白色酥皮）出品，　其　塲，今則原料日貴，不得不倫工减料，致翻毛之層次不多，且油少而乾，食之黏嘴，甜味亦遠遜於昔。館內竟有攙以麥粉者，尤覺乏味。</p>
<p>（三）其他：如糖樓一類（包括糖運子，冬瓜條，糖荸薺，糖藕，糖　，橘餅等等），除糖運子尙可外，其餘多堅硬不甜，無一　能如昔者。糖果一頭（包括各類水果糖皮糖等等），東安市塲之攤子上，所售較可，然已大遜於昔，其餘則更差。至南式點心，在昔如稻香村，桂香村等舖，均以蘇滬及嘉湖細點相爲號召，營業亦頗不惡，但出品實不如蘇滬之佳，近則每况愈下，惟甜度尙比北方各肆略濃。</p>
<p>（四）街頭攤子，及沿街叫賣各品：如否仁茶，切糕，糖豌豆，豌豆黃，大麥粥，炸年糕，油炸糕，豆渣糕等等，雖仍應有盡有，因均受偷工减料之原則所限制，亦一律大差。</p>
<p>（五）冷品：北平之酸梅湯，原甚著名，現所售者，均嫌其不甜。至其餘各點，更不足論。</p>
<p>總之，北平生活日苦，人民不得不力行節約，上項甜食，不無近於奢糜，値此物力維艱，能出高價購食者，日益見少，市肆爲營業計，不得不眨値招徠，出品自亦益低落，加以糖價極昂，工資日巨，欲求如昔時風味，惟有特出高價，向其定製，或尙可得佳品耳。</p>
<h3>羅斯福的失着</h3>
<p>— 金玉</p>
<p>作戰時最要緊的一件事是對敵情估計準確，如果統帥竟因種種原因而在這一方面犯了錯誤，其結果之悲慘是必然的。</p>
<p>然而，英明如羅斯福總統，竟也在第二次大戰中犯了極嚴重的估計的錯誤，造成了慘重的損失——他沒有想到，一位八十多歲的老「英雄」竟是一個甘心認賊作父的傢伙！</p>
<p>蘇聯外長莫洛托夫先後報聘英美時，美國那時的參謀總長馬歇爾將軍立刻向羅斯福報吿：歐洲第二戰綫在一九四二年一定可以開闢。羅斯福欣然把這個諾言吿訴了莫洛托夫，莫洛托夫欣然回到了蘇聯。美蘇的友誼到了巔峯。</p>
<p>但是，到了一九四二年，馬歇爾，羅斯福的特使霍布金斯，和美海軍上將金氏一同到英國去開了一次參謀會議後，一切的計劃都推翻了。英國統帥部認爲這時候開關歐洲第二戰綫勢必遭逢慘敗，他們竭力主張在北非登陸。</p>
<p>史達林對此當然大不高興，但是羅斯福在再三考慮之下，却接受了英國的意見。</p>
<p>北非登陸戰的開始日期是還一年的十一月八日。在一切籌備大致就緒的時候，羅斯福就寫了許多信給在北非有殖民地的各國元首，聲明登陸的動機。</p>
<p>這許多信之中，有一封是給法國的貝當老將的，羅斯福的措辭極爲婉轉，一開頭就稱貝當爲「老友」，下文還有「我們在一九一八年時誼屬同袍，而擊潰法國的宿仇德國，又爲今日共同之願望……」等語。同時，羅斯福又再三向邱吉爾要求，北非登陸戰應全由美軍負責，因爲美法交誼素篤，美國革命成功固靠法國幫忙，而第一次世界大戰中解救了法國的也就是美國，所以這次登陸時北非的法國駐軍一定不會抵抗，可以兵不血刃而定大局。</p>
<p>羅斯福的用心是深沉的。他一方面固然確信法國在北非的駐軍不會抵抗，而另一方面却還有</p>
<p>一點花樣——那時，野心勃勃的戴高樂正在英軍全力支持之下，而羅斯福却是一向討厭戴高樂那種大言不慚旁若無人的空架子，他下定了決心不讓戴高樂有脫穎而出的機會。</p>
<p>邱吉爾看了羅斯福給貝當的那封信，說：「寫得太客氣了！」羅斯福想了一想，就把「老友」等話全部刪掉。</p>
<p>貝當的回信來了，却是鋒銳得像一把利刃的一封信！什麼美法交誼之類的話一句也不提，倒冷冰冰地說：「你侮辱了法國。你旣下令攻擊，我就下令自衛了！」</p>
<p>結果是大戰三晝夜，美法變方的死傷都很慘重。羅斯福心目中的「凡爾登戰役的英雄」竟然是一個叛徒！美國打了一次不必要的仗，第二戰綫倒延遲了兩年才開闢，徒然使德國有從容準備的機會。（摘譯霍布金斯秘記）</p>
<h3>談後悔</h3>
<p>— 紀穆</p>
<p>我處理任何事一時失着時，事後並不後悔。譬如我擬投資於某項有價證券，偶有稽誤，未遑購進，過幾天却漲價了，甚至所漲的倍數很多，我對此殊無槌胸疾首之感。我却願意銀而靜思，分析一事成敗的前因後果，有失着處，則設法改善，以免日後重蹈覆轍。反之，徒事後悔，只有自尋煩惱，靈塞健全的思考力而已。</p>
<p>以前，我應付一事時，又犯上遲疑莫決的毛病。誠然，社會上有許多事情，確使人左右爲難。孔子說的「三思而後行」，也是要我們審愼將事之意。不渦旣然經過「三思」之後，都非「行」不可。據某事業家云，即使「行」錯了，還可以籌措補救之法，終要比坐視不行，勝過一籌。</p>
<p>本來，不知後悔，有時往往被人視爲不知悔過之意，我這裏說的不後悔，却係指不作感情上的無謂懊惱，但從理智上作冷靜的檢討，其意義固頗有不同也。</p>
<h3>並蒂蓮</h3>
<p>— 竹影</p>
<p>並蒂運一莖可開四花，或三花，最少者可開二花，瓣多而紅，其外之瓣，漸大漸淺，花大如牡丹，故又稱牡丹蓮。或云花種來自梵土，故極少。花又不結實，秋末乾於枝上，地下董與普通開蓮花者無異，故日有並頭運，無並頭藕。吾鄕南陽湖中，當見有一二朶開於湖上，人多視爲祥瑞，蓋轉年即不開矣。傳花含苞時，以手指之，即不復生，稱爲花中之仙品。</p>
<h3>陳筱石</h3>
<p>— 錢大成</p>
<p>讀本月十九日申報，悉陳筱石制軍夔龍於十八日病歿滬濱。筱石聰明老壽，然晚年於世事殊不了了。平日足不下樓，惟與親友日夕作馬弔戲；渠亦不知物價之狂漲，馬弔戲僅十元一底，每博而勝得數元，彌以自憲。其賭友暨十元五元之鈔票，皆由其家屬所羅致，藉此以慰其晚境之寂寞也。</p>
<p>筱石繼室許仲議女士，名禧身，早卒。能詩，有「亭秋館詩鈔」。筱石爲之序而刊行於世。序稱：「余率旨留守，偶有商榷，無不洞中機宜。事定後，偶有暇晷，輒挑證煮茗，賡和爲樂。……」則仲護固亦一時才女已。仲　集中有和筱石蘇台留別詩，有「琴鶴一肩鄉路熟，烟螺萬疊客心愁」之句，其風度亦殊不惡。</p>
<h3>夜坐</h3>
<p>— 尢墨若</p>
<p>街燈如豆絕筆暄，袒楊且留犢鼻裈。變般今生還剰我，衣冠斯世欲何言？十年磨劍心無敵，一夕驚霜鬢有痕。入耳蛩聲鳴不住，催秋消息到鄰園！</p>
<h3>虹口公園晚坐</h3>
<p>— 陳仲陶</p>
<p>雨後餘霞媚遠汀，芰荷冉冉送微聲，水光侵暝白逾雪，燈影隔林繁似星；靜境響敎忘世事，秋風先已到園亭，召聞覓句耽堅坐，一往孤心入窈冥。</p>
<p>###</p>
<p>展讀申報新出中國分省地　新版（戰前已出四版，今爲五版），至福建台灣一頁，欣慨交紫，不能自己。夫大戰之後，地圖變色，乃歷史之常事，而吾人於台漲更覺意義之深長者，固不只甲午之役，中日之事，而直溯到前明。</p>
<p>明季，荷蘭人占有台灌，鄭成功逐而去之，爲我亞洲漢族對外光榮戰史之第一頁。鄭先生佔台後，用爲根擄地，在明室旣亡，淸人勢力瀰漫全國之後，尙能奉明正朔，抵抗滿淸多年，直到淸順治去世，康熙繼統之初，亦還無如之何。不幸鄭部出了個賣國賣主的大奸施琅（即施公案小說及戲劇中所謂「施公」之父），他本是明朝的將官，鄭成功在世時尙能畏服，後來主將病歿，少主人（鄭經）與他小有意見，居然私逃越海，投降滿淸，大「獻地岡」，盡輸底薀，並且帶領攻取，把台灣送與淸人，施逆則受淸侯爵之封，落個罵名千戰。</p>
<p>台灣蜀淸之後二百年，淸人又割讓於日本；歷五十年，而復歸中華。綜前後而下史評，其爲民族之光榮，有重大之三階段：（一）對歐（鄭逐荷人）；（二）對淸（鄭氏據此一隅以對抗，宛如金城表海，銅柱摩天）；（三）對日（舉甲戌甲午之恥而雪滌之）。</p>
<p>割台之事，雖因甲午之戰，而日人之擾台窺台，則遠在甲午前二十年之甲戌。時爲淸同治十三年（一八七四），有琉球人在台爲土番所戕，本不與日本相十，而日人西鄕氏遠率兵船入台，任意搜殺，淸廷派沈葆楨前往鎭攝，給以五十萬之償款了結，以爲一樁小事，所費不多，殊不介意。而西鄕歸報其國，大表其功，因爲琉球人遭害，而賠款於日本，淸廷已默認琉球是屬於日本的了。此事淸廷固然麻麻胡胡，日人亦眞鬼鬼崇崇。</p>
<p>以後五年中，日人便暗中向琉球侵略，至光緒五年，公然宣布廢其國王，改爲「冲繩縣」，淸延如夢初覺，趕緊提起抗議派員交涉，日人振振有詞，遷延不決。至甲午戰役，索興鬧到朝鮮及遼東，戰後把台灣亦强索而去，當時李鴻章還問：「兩國戰事在東北，與遠遠的台漲甚麼相干？」但日人大勝特威，那容分說。豈料甲午與甲戌雖相去二十年，在彼則是一串的把戲！</p>
<p>中華民國三十四年八月，日人宣吿接受波茨坦宣言，退出侵略各地，把從前那些把戲，化為南柯一夢！</p>

<h3>Nationwide People Cherish the New Currency, Enthusiastically Exchanging Gold, Silver, and Foreign Currency, the President Listens to the Report and Feels Deeply Gratified</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 23rd] President Chiang Kai-shek, after presiding over the Central Memorial Week ceremony on the morning of the 23rd, immediately summoned Weng Wenhao, Yu Tiecheng, and Hong Lanyou to inquire about the implementation of the Emergency Measures for Financial and Economic Affairs. He also learned that Weng would visit the President again on the evening of the 23rd to report on the market situation on the first day after the implementation of the Emergency Measures. Reports from major cities such as Shanghai, Guangzhou, Beiping, Tianjin, and Hankou were also telegraphed in the evening. The general situation was extremely good, and many people went to exchange U.S. dollars and gold. The President was deeply gratified to hear of such good results on the first day. It is also learned that the President will still go to Kuling within the next few days.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 23rd] The 23rd was the first day for people to exchange gold, silver, and foreign currency for Gold Yuan Certificates. The people of Nanjing went to the Central Bank to exchange them voluntarily, presenting an unusually enthusiastic state. The excellent results have exceeded the expectations of the average person. According to the figures obtained from the overnight statistics of the Nanjing branch of the Central Bank, on the 23rd, U.S. dollars totaling 54,391 yuan, silver coins totaling 22,311 yuan, pure silver weighing 104 taels, Hong Kong dollars totaling 3,709 yuan, and gold totaling 1,747 taels were collected. The final settlement was not completed until 2 a.m. on the 24th. In total, 2.38 million Gold Yuan Certificates were exchanged on the 23rd, equivalent to 71.4 trillion Legal Tender. The people's enthusiastic exchange of gold, silver, and foreign currency for Gold Yuan Certificates, in addition to fully demonstrating the deep patriotism of the people, can also serve as the greatest guarantee that the currency reform will be successful.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 23rd] The Gold Yuan Certificates were officially issued on the 23rd. The exchange situation in Nanjing was very enthusiastic, and prices mostly trended downward. Banks, money shops, trust companies, and credit cooperatives, which had been closed for two days, resumed operations on the 23rd. The Nanjing branch of the Central Bank handled the work of collecting and exchanging gold, silver, foreign currency, silver dollars, and Legal Tender, and was still engaged in clearing and sorting until midnight on the 23rd. All the staff worked through the night. The number of Nanjing citizens who went to the Central Bank to exchange Gold Yuan Certificates on the 23rd was very large. Even those who went to exchange in the light rain were still unusually enthusiastic and came in an endless stream. Citizens automatically lined up, and the queue stretched from indoors to outdoors, from the Central Bank's Nanjing branch in the Jincheng Building to the U.S. Aid Utilization Commission in the Fuji Building, a distance of several hundred meters. Some even waited for several hours. The situation of people holding gold, silver, and foreign currency to exchange for Gold Yuan Certificates was particularly enthusiastic.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 23rd] The 23rd was the first day for the national banking and financial industry to resume operations after the promulgation of the Emergency Measures for Financial and Economic Affairs. The general situation in Nanjing was very good, and the financial market was also very stable. In order to strengthen supervision, the Ministry of Finance specially dispatched 10 people each from the Four Joint Treasury and the Central Bank at 11 a.m. on the 23rd to conduct on-site inspections of various banks and money shops. Zhang Zongqiao, the Director of the Currency Department of the Ministry of Finance, also personally went to the bill clearing house to inspect the bill exchange situation. The results of the bill exchange were also very good, and no bank or money shop had a shortage of funds during the exchange. On the 23rd, a total of 1,061 bills were exchanged, with a total amount of 3,039,918.49 Gold Yuan. There were more than 900 returned bills. It is reported that the Ministry of Finance, the Four Joint Treasury, and the Central Bank will continue to send personnel to various banks and money shops for on-site inspections.</p>

<h3>President Weng Reports on the Government's Current Important Measures at the Kuomintang Memorial Week, Guaranteeing Social Order and Establishing a Stable Foundation</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 23rd] The Kuomintang Central Committee held a memorial week ceremony on the morning of the 23rd. President Chiang Kai-shek personally presided over the ceremony, and Premier Weng Wenhao attended to report on the government's current important measures. Premier Weng stated: "The most important things that must be carried out earnestly at present are two things: one is to prohibit and curb the destruction and harassment of bandits and spies, in order to protect social order; the second is to stop currency inflation and market fluctuations, in order to achieve economic stability. In fact, social order and economic stability are two things that are interrelated and mutually influential. They are really the same thing. The government's work must proceed simultaneously and receive a consistent response from the hearts of the people in society in order to achieve substantial results."</p>
<p>"Recently, the government has been working diligently on these tasks and has already begun. It is waiting to persist and continue without懈怠 in order to fully realize them. Important situations are briefly explained as follows:"</p>
<p>"First, it is to investigate and imprison spies in various places in the rear who are being used by bandits and spies. Recently, these spies often挑拨离间 stir up trouble and incite student strikes, worker strikes, and other trends, resulting in riots and disturbances. In order to protect social order and maintain order, the government must be responsible for presiding over the matter through the competent authorities. The military and police are working hard to assist in suppressing violence, which is the way to appease the good, and punishing evil is the way to curb chaos. In order to ensure a fair trial, all those involved in the case will be handed over to special courts for investigation and research in accordance with the law, and they will be dealt with promptly according to the severity of their circumstances. Everyone must understand that this suppression of bandits and spies is purely to safeguard the foundation of the nation and protect the people. The great righteousness is obvious. The meaning lies in the fact that the government has previously issued announcements to the people, distinguishing right from wrong, and jointly facing national difficulties. Our founding father devoted himself to the national revolution and established the foundation of democratic politics. Our President unified the country, sincerely resisted Japan, recovered the lost territories of the past 50 years, and abolished the unequal treaties of the past 100 years. The Chinese Communists have always borrowed names to harm the country and the people. The facts are obvious. I sincerely hope that people in society will understand justice, not go astray, and promote the proper demeanor that a citizen should have."</p>
<p>"Second, it is to reform the currency system, implement the cessation of currency inflation, and provide the country with stable and reliable currency. Since the Anti-Japanese War, the amount of Legal Tender has been relatively large. However, the whole country has been looking forward to construction in a peaceful environment after Japan's surrender, in order to achieve well-being as soon as possible. Unfortunately, the Communist bandits disregard the overall situation and deliberately disrupt it, year after year. The amount of Legal Tender issued has therefore increased even more. In addition, there are often unscrupulous merchants in the market who speculate and hoard goods, smuggle and evade taxes, and engage in various activities, which have led to rising prices and insecure lives. The national economy and people's livelihood have suffered deeply. The Gold Yuan Certificates that are now being issued are aimed at preventing this abuse. First, there is full preparation, which is publicly announced; second, there is a limited amount, which will never be inflated; third, there are large quantities of metal transfer coins to facilitate circulation; fourth, the government will earnestly support international trade and other legitimate uses in accordance with the prescribed exchange rate. Therefore, it can maintain a solid and reliable reputation, which is sufficient to eliminate the various unstable factors of the past. According to modern economic theory, currency is the basis of various economic phenomena. Currency inflation will inevitably lead to market unrest, while currency stability will allow trade and exchange to have a reliable value and a sufficient medium of credit. Once the source is clear, the water flow will naturally be correct. At the same time, the government has decided on a policy to increase revenue as much as possible and to save expenses properly, in order to achieve a budget balance. It should also increase export trade and encourage smooth overseas remittances in order to improve the balance of international payments. Once the basic conditions are thoroughly improved and a correct track is established, there is no reason for market prices to be more affected. The government has painstakingly planned and adopted this method of treating the root causes and clearing the source. For those unscrupulous merchants who still intend to destroy it, they should be regarded as public enemies of the nation and the people, and they should be strictly prohibited and severely punished. The government will never allow the selfish interests of a small number of people to harm the bright phenomenon of this new era."</p>
<p>"Third, it is to collect and store all gold, silver, and foreign currency within Chinese territory. According to the common practice in modern countries, these foreign exchange, gold, and silver, and foreign currency are not allowed to circulate freely or be used as tools in the speculative market. This measure stipulates three outlets: (1) to be used to exchange for Gold Yuan Certificates; (2) to purchase U.S. dollars at official prices; (3) to establish foreign exchange deposits in national banks, retaining their ownership and still being available for legitimate purposes. Such a measure is extremely preferential. By handling it in this way, the ownership is preserved and it can still be used for legitimate purposes. It is truly beneficial and harmless. If the original holder hesitates to avoid it and still refuses to exchange or deposit it in accordance with the legal outlets after the statutory deadline, then the original holder despises the law, harms the public interest of the country out of self-interest, and therefore, once discovered, it should be confiscated and turned over to the public. This is truly a punishment that fits the crime and is by no means harsh. In addition, there are still a few places, such as Guangzhou, where Hong Kong dollars are used, and Qingdao, where U.S. dollars are used. These are extremely irregular behaviors that must be quickly improved and exchanged for Chinese banknotes. This is a proper behavior that a citizen should have, and it is hoped that it will be realized quickly. There are also some people who like to leak domestic funds to foreign places to purchase property. At a time when the country is in dire need of funds and the government is earnestly striving, the actions of these people are the opposite, forgetting their own nationality and becoming actions that harm the country. From the perspective of foreigners, it is not shameful, and they should also feel ashamed when they ask themselves. Looking at the European countries since the last world war, all of them have tried their best to prohibit the export of funds, and even legitimate foreign investment has been temporarily suspended. How can our country sit idly by and let the leakage occur without trying to curb it? This measure also stipulates treatment methods, welcoming conscientious citizens to enthusiastically donate, which not only preserves their personality but also contributes to the country. From the above brief explanation, it can be seen that the bandits and spies want to destroy social order, and the government is doing its best to maintain it. The bandits and spies want our currency to inflate maliciously, and the government has resolutely eliminated inflation. The bandits and spies want to shake and destroy our economy, and the government is establishing a fundamentally stable foundation. In this era of tit-for-tat and active struggle, I sincerely hope that compatriots across the country will recognize the correct direction, unite as one, and move forward together."</p>

<h3>Hong Kong's Financial Market Stabilizes, the Banking Industry Is Optimistic About Our New Measures, Believing That the Official Exchange Rate Can Encourage Overseas Remittances</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Hong Kong, 23rd] Since the exchange rate between the Gold Yuan and the Hong Kong dollar was determined to be 7.5 Jiao for one Hong Kong dollar, the four major national banks and other major banks here have been handling domestic remittances at this rate on the 23rd. Due to the stable foundation of the Gold Yuan, the exchange rate set by various banks is 74 Gold Yuan for 100 Hong Kong dollars, with the remittance fee excluded. The gold market was quite chaotic for a time after the emergency currency reform, but it has now safely passed. The opening situation in the morning turned better. Observers believe that the official exchange rate between the Hong Kong dollar and the Gold Yuan is an important factor in stabilizing the market. When the market opened this morning, gold was 323 Hong Kong dollars per tael, and then it fluctuated. It rose to 324.5 Hong Kong dollars at noon, but returned to 323 Hong Kong dollars at closing. The U.S. dollar was 5.41 Hong Kong dollars, with only a slight difference of one or two Fen in the rise and fall. The Shanghai and New York exchange rates of local banks and money shops are 4.5 Jiao Hong Kong dollars for 1 million Legal Tender. Although people in the banking and financial industries generally maintain a wait-and-see attitude, they are all optimistic about the results of the new economic measures. It is said that the official exchange rate between the Gold Yuan and the Hong Kong dollar is extremely appropriate and in line with reality. In addition to eliminating speculation in the new currency, it can also encourage overseas remittances and curb the evasion of hot money to Hong Kong. Overseas Chinese in the United States, Southeast Asia, and around the world will directly remit money to the country under favorable exchange rates in the future, without the risk of depreciation.</p>

<h3>Property Registration Is Still Handled Separately by Various Ministries and Commissions</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 23rd] News Bureau reports: Those responsible from the Ministry of Finance said: Property registration is originally under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Interior, but in fact, the actual registration business is handled separately by various ministries and commissions, such as the judicial and land administration organs handling real estate and land registration, the Ministry of Industry and Commerce and local social administrative organs handling various commercial registrations, the transportation administrative organs handling vehicle and vessel registrations, and the Ministry of Interior handling copyright registration, etc., which are mostly organized by enacting laws separately to meet the needs of performing their respective administrative affairs. As for the local government conducting surveys and registrations of general property or special property within the district in order to handle a certain administrative matter, it is also a common practice. The Ministry has no opinion on this. Regarding the unified method of property registration, the civil servant office of the National Government gathered relevant ministries and commissions for several discussions before the winter of 1945. In 1946, the Ministry was ordered to discuss the issue of a one-time property tax, and it also repeatedly discussed it with relevant ministries and commissions. In the end, it was decided that it was too extensive, and all agreed that the various ministries and commissions should continue to handle it.</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>The New Currency System and Price Controls</h3>
<p>Currency is the measure of prices, and at the same time, prices are the measure of currency. Therefore, to stabilize prices, one must first stabilize the value of the currency; and to stabilize the value of the currency, one must simultaneously stabilize prices. This is an immutable principle. This time, the currency reform has adopted many measures to strengthen price controls. Central and local leaders have repeatedly emphasized that prices should be based on those of August 19th, allowing only decreases, not increases, and violators will be severely punished by the Special Criminal Tribunal. People are also very concerned about the future direction of prices, believing that the success or failure of the new currency system can be easily seen in the price levels. This shows the close relationship between prices and the currency system.</p>
<p>In addition to being a medium of exchange, another function of currency is to store value, which manifests itself in the form of people's savings, i.e., the amount of deposits in banks. Therefore, if the new currency system is truly sound, then various deposits will increase in the future, and speculative capital in the market will decrease sharply; and the trend of speculation and hoarding will also change greatly. The Emergency Financial and Economic Measures promulgated this time, in addition to declaring full reserves for open issuance, also have strict regulations regarding the crackdown on speculation and hoarding, and the increase in bank capital; and the stock exchanges in Shanghai and Tianjin have been ordered to temporarily suspend operations, with the intention of diverting speculative capital into the right track to consolidate the value of the new currency and increase people's savings.</p>
<p>The current system adopted is a managed gold standard. Although there are full reserves, it is not allowed to be redeemed. Although the exchange rate with the US dollar is set at four to one, foreign exchange is not open. Therefore, to consolidate the currency value and promote savings, in addition to open issuance, limiting the amount of issuance, minting real subsidiary coins, and striving for a balance of financial revenue and expenditure and international payments, there is indeed nothing else that can be done to strengthen it. However, before the new currency begins to be issued and the old currency redemption has not expired, if the amount of old currency redeemed cannot be offset by the amount of new currency issued, then the actual circulating chips and the degree of speculative capital may exceed that of the past. Also, during the stock exchange closure period, surplus funds will inevitably have one less outlet, and when the gold, silver, and foreign currencies hidden by the people are exchanged in compliance with the order, the state must issue an equivalent amount of new currency for redemption. The amount of such gold, silver, and foreign currencies should be substantial, and the redemption period is limited to the end of September this year. Within this short period of 40 days, how should the huge amount of new currency issued for redemption be absorbed to avoid inflation and maintain the value of the new currency? This issue is really very important. I wonder if the government, in addition to giving out US dollar bonds and allowing deposits in the Central Bank, has prepared other practical and effective countermeasures?</p>
<p>As for prices: The government's specific measures to strengthen control are as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Price Limits: All prices will be frozen at the level of this month's 19th. Any price exceeding this level will be considered a black market and sent to the Special Criminal Tribunal for investigation. In theory, this is very satisfactory. Because prices will not rise from now on, the value of the currency will not fall from now on, the cost of living index can be cancelled from now on, and speculation and hoarding will not be profitable. However, the method of price limits, when applied to a few cities and specific goods in the past, was not very effective. For example, the rice and flour prices in this city have been limited and cancelled repeatedly, and finally allowed to run their natural course. This is not because the authorities did not handle it well, but because the economic situation was too volatile and the people's spirit of abiding by the law was too weak, so there was an inevitability that it was difficult to strictly implement. Now, to implement this price limit universally throughout the country, and to implement it universally on all commodities, how should the execution technology be improved and strengthened? This is indeed worth careful study.</p>
<p>(2) Prohibition of Publishing Black Market Prices: This is very easy to do. But judging from the past gold notes, even if the newspaper does not mention a word, everyone knows the black market price very well, and it has not been completely eradicated. If you really want to curb black market news to avoid stimulating prices, then the technology still seems to need improvement. Especially in Qingdao, Xiamen, Guangzhou, and other places, the gold note market is completely open. In many inland provinces, silver dollars are the actual measure and medium of trade, not just a speculative object. Whether this open black market can be eliminated by prohibiting newspapers from publishing it is indeed a question. Otherwise, looking at it so simply may invite the ridicule of burying one's head in the sand.</p>
<p>(3) Inspection of Warehouses: The intention is to prohibit hoarding in order to stabilize prices. This is being gradually promoted in Shanghai. Leaving aside the fact that many warehouses are said to have other reasons and are not suitable for inspection, even if all warehouses are inspected, the goods that exceed the statutory quantity and period will only be confiscated or auctioned. In the short term, the huge amount of confiscated and auctioned goods may have a considerable effect on price stabilization, but after the event, with the reduction of materials, or because the inspection is too strict and the source is blocked, the result of supply falling short of demand may not be able to cause the opposite bad result. Therefore, the actual effect of inspecting warehouses may not be as great as expected.</p>
<p>(4) Strictly Punishing Speculation and Hoarding: Regarding this point, in addition to repeatedly stating it in the Emergency Measures, the President has also strictly ordered all provinces and cities to comply. On the one hand, an Economic Control Committee has been established, and special commissioners have been sent to the three cities of Shanghai, Tianjin, and Guangzhou to be responsible for supervision. In the future, strict investigations will be carried out, and the law will be enforced. The trend of hoarding in various places will gradually subside. What is worrying is: (1) The personnel who carry out the investigation and arrest may not all be able to "faithfully abide by the law." In the past, many such cases of using public office for private gain have been discovered. (2) The real big hoarders and speculators often have connections and backgrounds, and they do not worry about not having a suitable name to borrow. Especially those special people who are neither officials nor businessmen, but also officials and businessmen, are well-connected and have all kinds of tricks. If this trend is slightly lenient and cannot be "broken with force," then all control policies may still become a dead letter, and may not be able to achieve the effect of stabilizing prices.</p>
<p>(5) Limiting Salaries and Cancelling the Calculation of Salaries Based on the Cost of Living Index, Limiting the Salaries of All Employees, and Not Allowing Arbitrary Increases: This is naturally also one of the ways to stabilize prices. But we must not forget that salary increases can raise prices, and price increases are also the main reason for increasing salaries. These two are mutually cause and effect.</p>
<p>(6) Selling Materials: When the supply is sufficient, prices will naturally be stable. This method is relatively the most practical. However, when implementing the sale, regardless of whether it is surplus materials, enemy puppet materials, or materials ordered and purchased, one must not focus on profits and openly raise prices, leading to the same mistakes of leading price increases. The various products produced by state-owned enterprises should especially reduce prices and take the lead in promoting price stabilization. The Resources Commission has already telegraphed its subordinate units that the selling price of all products should be based on the local prices on the 19th of this month, converted into gold yuan, and absolutely no increase is allowed. Violators will be dismissed and punished. It is hoped that this ban can be maintained forever.</p>
<p>(7) Reducing Interest Rates: Interest is one of the elements that make up costs. Reducing interest rates is to reduce costs: This will not be a small help in suppressing prices. The Central Bank has already agreed that the daily interbank lending rate of state banks is 0.25%, and the monthly interest rate on loans should not exceed 0.3%. The interest rate on interbank deposits and national bank treasury deposits is 0.2% per month. Commercial banks have also decided that the monthly interest rate on deposits is 0.3%, and the loan interest rate is 1.5%. This is very different from the past market interest rates. However, at this time of transition between the old and the new, whether these interest rates can arouse the interest of general depositors remains to be seen. If deposits do not increase sharply for a while, but loan applications come in droves, can we temporarily stop lending as a reason and reject them all? Now, the activity of various forms of underground money houses does not seem to have weakened, and the phenomenon of commercial firms accepting deposits is even more common. If the legitimate needs of the industrial and commercial circles cannot be met through appropriate channels, I am afraid that reducing interest rates will also be hindered in practice.</p>
<p>Although the above-mentioned methods have both advantages and disadvantages, and may not be enough to achieve the goal of stabilizing prices, our intention in listing the pros and cons is still to urge the authorities to seek improvements in order to exert the role of control, and is by no means passively criticizing, hoping to eliminate the shackles of control. As for the fundamental solution, it is nothing more than developing production and increasing supply in order to naturally suppress prices. This depends on further measures by the authorities, such as improving the industrial environment, reducing production costs, and facilitating transportation and increasing power, etc. On the surface, although it has less to do with the new currency system, in reality, if production cannot be vigorously increased, it will be difficult to suppress prices overnight. Therefore, we believe that it is not enough to just work on the symptoms, and we should start from the big picture and the long term, and strive for a fundamental solution. Premier Weng has also pointed out to the representatives of the financial and industrial circles that adjusting the production, sales, and supply of daily necessities is one of the basic conditions for reforming the currency system. We hope that these basic conditions should be promoted simultaneously and effectively in order to naturally achieve the goal of stabilizing prices.</p>
<h3>Currency Reform Wins Popular Support; People Everywhere Rush to Exchange for Gold Yuan Certificates</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 23rd] Today is the first day of the issuance of Gold Yuan Certificates. According to the telegrams received by this agency from all over the country, the redemption situation is very good. People are enthusiastically taking gold notes and silver dollars to the National Bank for exchange, queuing up and waiting in an orderly manner.</p>

A large batch will continue to be transported on the 24th. Under the strict supervision of the authorities, prices are trending downwards. The rice market opened with coarse japonica at 17.3 yuan and white japonica at 19.5 yuan. Because vegetable vendors were ignorantly raising prices for profit, the prices in the vegetable market were chaotic. The police bureau decided to send police officers to be stationed there to monitor and correct prices at any time. Many retail stores were also privately marking up prices on the Shanghai product standard. After the police bureau sent police officers to investigate house by house by district, dozens of stores were found. In addition to ordering the prices to be corrected on the spot, the persons in charge of the stores were taken to the bureau for investigation. The merchants were shaken and voluntarily restored the original prices of August 19th.</p>
<p>Wuxi [Our Correspondent in Wuxi, 23rd] After the Gold Yuan Certificates were issued, both bulls and bears adopted a cautious approach. Transactions were rare, and prices were uniformly downwards.

<p>[Our Correspondent in Changsha, 23rd] Gold Yuan Certificates have been issued, and banks and money houses have resumed business. People in Changsha are nervous and looking forward to the unfolding of this new era with historical significance. A small number of unscrupulous merchants do not understand the meaning of currency reform and are actually buying large amounts of silver dollars for hoarding, causing silver dollar prices to rise to 6.4 million legal tender per dollar, exceeding the statutory 400,000. Bank interest rates are 6 yuan per 1,000 yuan per day, and money house interest rates are 20 yuan per 1,000 yuan per day, with compound interest charged externally. Every 100 yuan of Gold Yuan Certificates can earn 60 yuan in interest, plus compound interest that is turned over every five days, which is nearly 80 yuan. Commentators believe that those who hold this view should be killed.</p>

However, there was no entire bar of gold, and silver dollars were mostly in denominations of 30 or 20 yuan. Fewer people exchanged US dollars. There were more places to exchange legal tender for Gold Yuan, so the order was better. The market stagnation of the past three days has made the banks extremely busy. Police and military police maintained order with guns. Few people inquired about silver dollars in the market. Occasionally, transactions were made at 5.9 million, which was due to small citizens who were unable to withstand the crowded exchange and urgently needed cash. Prices were weak, and many people were still watching. Boat flour was 8 yuan, a drop of 0.3 yuan. The rest of the transactions were sparse. Cotton cloth has not yet opened. Few shops have changed to mark prices in Gold Yuan. The official supervision is very strict, and prices have not moved.</p>

Today, except for lump coal, which rose to 136.5 yuan per ton due to a shortage of sources, the market was generally weak. According to investigation, the reason for this is that the money supply is still tight due to the currency reform, and the prices in other places have fallen uniformly.

<h3>Kremlin Conducts Final Negotiations Yesterday; Stalin Participates in Meeting; Agreement on German Issue Expected</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Reports] London, 23rd, Moscow report: The British, American, and French ambassadors held a meeting at the French Embassy on the morning of the 23rd. It is reported that the differences between France and Britain and the United States have been eliminated in the exchange of notes over the weekend, leading to a general sense of optimism. This optimism is growing as the decisive meeting in the Kremlin approaches. It is expected that the three ambassadors will meet with Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov in the afternoon or evening, and it is said that Stalin will also be present at that time. According to reliable sources, French Ambassador Chatelau has received new instructions from Paris. According to well-informed French sources, the British, American, and French ambassadors will meet with Stalin in the Kremlin on Monday evening. The meeting is expected to begin at 8:00 PM (standard time).</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper Reports] Well-informed observers predict that the Kremlin meeting will reach some agreements, which is why Stalin is willing to attend the meeting. If an agreement is reached, it will be announced simultaneously in the four national capitals.</p>
<p>[United Press, London, 23rd] The "Three-Person Emergency Committee" composed of British Undersecretary of State Strang, U.S. Ambassador Douglas, and French Ambassador Massigli met this morning at the British Foreign Office. It is reported that the topic of the meeting was to discuss the next steps of the three countries regarding the Kremlin talks.</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 23rd] Diplomatic sources said on the 23rd that the four-power Moscow Conference has reached a decisive stage, but the outcome is still uncertain. If no unexpected new obstacles arise at the last minute, the world may know the outcome of the long-term secret negotiations before the weekend. Officials unanimously believe that neither optimism nor pessimism is appropriate at this time. It is said that the negotiations have reached a stage that can determine the survival of the "Cold War." The discussions among Britain, the United States, France, and the Soviet Union have focused primarily on the Berlin land blockade, which has now entered its fourth week, and may also be its last week. The British, American, and French ambassadors met for two hours on the 22nd. It is understood that they are ready to begin their sixth and final meeting with Molotov. Nothing has been heard here about the progress of these important negotiations. The State Department has remained tight-lipped, except to acknowledge that Moscow exists in the world and that negotiations on Germany are taking place there. However, reliable sources have revealed the following broad characteristics of the meeting: The Berlin blockade remains the most important issue, and secondary attention is focused on other German issues and the possibility of convening a four-foreign minister conference. Britain, the United States, and France are taking a united front in dealing with Soviet demands. Rumors of discord among the three powers last week are not believed here. The four powers will not begin dealing with a German peace treaty because of the Moscow talks, unless the Western countries believe that continued efforts will lead to success. It is understood that the West believes that raising the matter again would only mislead the world about the prospects for peace.</p>

When the Soviets questioned Hidden, they focused on his motives for taking pictures and did not seem very interested in his position.</p>
<p>As for Andermann, he was arrested in the British-occupied zone yesterday in retaliation for the kidnapping of several police officers in the western zone. British authorities said that Andermann may be tried by a German court, but since Hidden has been released, the West will send Andermann back. At the same time, British and American authorities are increasing patrols at Potsdamer Platz to prevent further kidnappings. The Americans have nicknamed the square "Kidnapping Corner." Traffic in the area has almost come to a standstill due to tensions between the East and West. Black market merchants have disappeared from the area.</p>

<h3>Human Rights Commission Approves Amendment to Press Convention; Case to be Submitted to UN General Assembly for Approval</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Geneva, 22nd, United Press] According to the U.S. representative, the freedom of the press convention passed by the Human Rights Commission of the United Nations Economic and Social Council has weakened the content of the original document drafted by the United Nations conference attended by more than 50 countries. The original document was related to the collection of news and its dissemination internationally. After a day-long dispute over procedural issues, 16 countries participated in the vote, with nine in favor: the United States, Britain, China, France, Denmark, the Netherlands, Peru, Turkey, and Venezuela; three against: the Soviet Union, Poland, and Byelorussia; and four abstentions: Canada, Australia, New Zealand, and Lebanon. Due to the East-West stalemate, the Human Rights Commission must submit the amendment to the Press Convention to the United Nations General Assembly to be convened in Paris. Earlier, due to Soviet opposition, the Human Rights Commission's consideration of the first convention was delayed for two weeks. Furthermore, it was unable to consider the amendments that had been passed but were still subject to much controversy. The U.S. representative also said that because of the decision not to make further recommendations, the chances of the General Assembly approving the convention have decreased.</p>

<h3>Rumor: 2,000 Armed Chinese Gather on Siamese-Malayan Border; British Troops Supporting Siam to Quell Rebellion Drive North</h3>
<p>[United Press, Singapore, 22nd] According to reliable sources on the 22nd, armed Chinese have concentrated within Thailand, five to ten miles from the Thai-Malayan border. Senior government officials and New Kota police authorities declined to comment, but believe that if the information is true, Kelantan will face a serious threat. Observers pointed out that these troops may be communists who have infiltrated Thailand from China. However, according to well-informed sources, it is more likely that they are former Malayan terrorists who fled to Thailand and are now trying to return. The number of people in their ranks is currently impossible to estimate, but it is rumored that each team has about 40 to 50 people.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Singapore, 22nd] According to reports from Bachok, five groups of armed Overseas Chinese, each with about 400 people, have concentrated on the Siamese border, preparing to invade Malaya from Kelantan. Senior military and police authorities in Bachok refused to confirm the information, saying only that Kelantan was prepared to resist any threat.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Rangoon, 22nd] According to well-informed sources here, if Siam has only its weak air force in peacetime, the country will fall into the hands of traitors. Currently, a huge new threat has emerged, known as the "Cats of the Forest," who are motley thugs who do not obey anyone and specialize in robbing and raping defenseless villagers. They are now the authority of the day, strictly enforcing orders. Neither the government nor the rebels know how to deal with this new factor. Many have fled due to the government's suppression of the rebellion, so its forces are weak and have no time or strength to eliminate the "Cats of the Forest," some of whom are young women who can ride long distances every day. The defection of a part of the White Army has resulted in weapons falling into the hands of these robbers.</p>
<p>The most recent development is that British troops have driven straight south from the north to assist the government in attacking the rebels.</p>
<h3>Iran Declares All Agreements Regarding Byron Oil Fields Invalid; Reserves the Right to Protest Infringements in the Future</h3>
<p>[United Press, Tehran, 23rd] After a week of debate, the Iranian parliament today passed a vote of confidence in Prime Minister Hakim's government by a vote of 93 to 8. The topic of the debate was the government's policy on the Byron oil fields and U.S. aid. During the debate, Foreign Minister Esfandiary announced that the Iranian government considers all oil agreements relating to the Byron oil fields to be invalid. He said, "Iran reserves the right to formally protest any future acts that infringe on the sovereignty of the oil fields."</p>
<h3>Purges Intensified in South Yugoslavia; Large Numbers of Anti-Tito Elements Arrested</h3>
<p>[United Press, Belgrade, 22nd] According to reliable sources, hundreds of Yugoslav personnel, including 50 secret police officers, have been arrested within ten days in a purge of suspected supporters of the Communist Information Bureau and opponents of Marshal Tito. The Communist Information Bureau has repeatedly criticized Tito as an enemy of international communism. The Yugoslav Communist Party has also declared its loyalty to Tito, while at the same time emphasizing their loyalty to Soviet Premier Stalin and the Soviet Communist Party.</p>
<p>The recent purges began on August 4 with the arrest of four officials of the Montenegrin Provincial Government, including Zizi, who is known to be pro-Soviet. Vukovic, the vice president of the province, was also arrested. In addition, Kosovo, a former South Yugoslav press officer at the United Nations and editor of the country's official news agency, and Lakovic, a law doctorate and pre-war communist leader in the province, were also reportedly arrested. The purges apparently did not affect province president Blažo Jovanović, the brother of the former chief of staff, General Vukomanovic, who was recently shot and killed. According to reliable sources, on the same day that Vuković fled and was shot, Major General Popivoda and another unnamed general also fled by plane to an undisclosed destination on the 18th.</p>

<p>[United Press International, New York, August 22] Wallace today accused Truman and Missouri Democrats of attempting to steal the state election in November. Wallace stated that Missouri Secretary of State Nelson yesterday ruled that the Progressive Party had no right to be elected. This "is a blatant attempt to steal the Missouri election." Wallace stated, "I warn Truman that the American people will not tolerate any stolen election." He stated that Nelson had publicly announced that the Democratic Party only had 81,000 more votes than the Republican Party in the Missouri primary. "Truman is clearly panicked by the support the Progressive Party has gained from tens of thousands of Republicans, Democrats, and independents."</p>
<h3>Soviet Consul General Lomakin's Mysterious Disappearance; Once Appeared on Long Island, New York</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, New York, August 22] The disappearance of Soviet Consul General to New York, Lomakin, became a hot topic for the press here on the 22nd. It is reported that since Lomakin left the Soviet Consulate with four people on the afternoon of the 21st, looking worried, no one has known his whereabouts. The press here speculates that his disappearance is related to the departure of three Soviet diplomats from the United States on the evening of the 23rd, who are taking a route through Stockholm, the capital of Sweden, back to Moscow. However, the mystery of this mysterious disappearance will eventually be solved, because a car belonging to the Soviet diplomatic representative in the United States was stopped by a police officer in Glen Cove, Long Island, New York, for speeding, and Lomakin was surprisingly found inside the car.</p>
<h3>Global Christian Conference Opens in the Netherlands; 3,000 People Participate in Prayer Service</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Amsterdam, August 22, United Press] The World Council of Churches Assembly held its opening prayer service today at the New Amsterdam Church here. Church leaders from all over the world marched into the church in procession at 3 p.m. A total of 3,000 people participated in the prayer, making this the largest gathering of Christian churches from around the world in history. Although countries behind the Iron Curtain, such as Czechoslovakia, Hungary, and other Eastern European countries, had representatives present, the Greek Church of the Soviet Union had no representative.</p>
<p>Among the representatives from various countries, the most notable was German pastor Niemöller, who was famous for opposing Hitler. The purpose of this meeting is to organize the World Council of Churches and make it a permanent global cooperation organization. Dr. Mott Mortimer, one of the leaders of the church unity movement, delivered the opening speech, briefly outlining the history of the church unity movement and expressing his deep belief that the church should address various unresolved issues. The number of issues currently pending is unprecedented in history.

<h3>Palestinian-Jewish Dispute to Be Submitted to UN General Assembly for Discussion; Bernadotte Decides to Abandon Mediation</h3>
<p>[United Press International, Stockholm, August 22] United Nations Mediator Count Bernadotte said here on the 22nd that he had abandoned his attempts to peacefully resolve the Palestinian issue, at least until the United Nations General Assembly discusses the matter. He said that attempting to arrange peace talks again would be futile for the time being, as the two sides seem to have no common ground for a possible agreement. Bernadotte came here to attend the International Red Cross Conference, of which he is chairman, but he will return to the Middle East for another round of talks with Arab and Jewish leaders. He will then draft a detailed report on Palestine to be submitted to the United Nations General Assembly to be convened in Paris next month.</p>
<p>Bernadotte will also complete a detailed report on the situation in Jerusalem, with recommendations on the future status of the city. The Holy City has been a point of contention between the Arabs and Jews and may be the most difficult issue in the Holy Land dispute. Observers say that the UN General Assembly will decide how to resolve the Palestinian issue. Bernadotte believes that the Arab and Jewish sides will accept the solution passed by the majority of the world's countries. It is generally believed that any solution must be accompanied by sanctions and threats, and the Arab and Jewish sides should be forced under world pressure.</p>

<h3>Reporting on the Recent Political Situation in Japan; Ashida to Meet MacArthur This Afternoon; Special Diet Session to Be Postponed</h3>

<p>[Central News Agency, Tokyo, August 23] Japanese Prime Minister Hitoshi Ashida is currently inspecting Niigata. He told reporters yesterday that Japan has encountered "a very important problem," which makes it impossible for the special session of the Japanese Diet to be held soon. He declined to announce the nature of the problem. He has promised to make a very important statement in the near future. His announcement has aroused speculation in all quarters.</p>
<h3>The Spiritual Leaders of Blacks and Jews Protest the "Era of Terror"; Prelude to the US November Election, Part 5</h3>
<p>— Special Correspondent of This Newspaper in the United States, Mao Shuqing</p>
<p>When Wallace's Progressive Party was first established, the China Revolutionary Committee and the Democratic League, which were in exile in Hong Kong, both sent telegrams to congratulate Wallace. In the United States, according to rough estimates by The New York Times, the Progressive Party may receive more than three million votes in the November election this year, roughly the same as the Progressive Party of Theodore Roosevelt's time in 1912. Wallace's strong supporters are mostly young people, women, laborers, or veterans. At the Progressive Party's founding convention in Philadelphia, there were about 2,000 delegates and as many as 8,000 attendees. Among the delegates, women accounted for 30%, those under 40 accounted for 60%, union members accounted for 35%, and veterans accounted for 20%.</p>
<p>The scene was chaotic, more chaotic than the Republican and Democratic parties. Most resolutions were passed amidst shouts and clamor. In addition to the above four groups, blacks and Jews were very prominent in the party. The opening speech was given by Howard, a black lawyer from Iowa (Wallace's hometown). Howard initially spoke about humanity's need for peace and that only Wallace could save peace in the United States. He said that after the Progressive Party is elected, it is prepared to build eight million houses to alleviate America's serious housing shortage. The Progressive Party advocates for the nationalization of large industries and stipulates a minimum wage for workers of one dollar per hour. He said that the Progressive Party advocates for equal employment and the abolition of racial discrimination. He said, "Since I have followed Mr. Wallace, I have enjoyed equal treatment that I have never had before... In the past, the Republican and Democratic parties also talked about abolishing racial discrimination, but they are still full of white supremacy, especially in several southern states, which is especially severe." Howard spoke vigorously, and many whites and blacks applauded in the audience.</p>
<p>Jews are also considered an oppressed "minority" in the United States. Many Jewish-American citizens have now become followers of Wallace. Isaacson, a Jewish member of Congress, was one of the most prominent representatives at this Wallace party convention. Some say that Isaacson's speech this time will win at least hundreds of thousands of votes for Wallace, which seems very likely. This Isaacson is a member of the House of Representatives elected from the 24th district of New York. He recently returned from an inspection of Palestine and said that the Truman administration is carrying out a new conspiracy against the Jewish state with Britain, preparing to gradually blockade the newly established Jewish state. The Truman administration despises Jews, and their current hypocritical performance is entirely to cope with the November election and win votes. Once the election is over, they are prepared to declare that the Jewish state (the State of Israel) is protected by Britain and the United States. Britain will still obtain the port of "Israel" as their military base, sell Jerusalem to Abduallah, the Muslim king of Outer Jordan, and strictly limit Jewish immigration. In this way, it would be tantamount to making the Jewish state an appendage of the Kingdom of Outer Jordan, while also returning to a part of the "British Empire." He said that the results of decades of struggle by the Jews will be destroyed by the Truman administration, "because these politicians in the Republican and Democratic parties still harbor deep-rooted racial prejudices and discriminate against Jews!"</p>
<p>Isaacson explained that everything he saw during this inspection was correct. He said that if President Truman wanted to "deny" these facts, he would be willing to accompany the president on another trip to see. He said, "Despite the fact that you capitalists, for the sake of the interests of Middle Eastern and Near Eastern oil fields, are making plans that violate the survival rights of the Jewish people, the Jewish people will not be conquered." He said, "For decades, Hitler's barbarity and the British Empire's cruelty have failed to exterminate the Jews. On the contrary, like a towering giant, the new Jewish state is still reborn!" Isaacson called on Jewish-American citizens to unite and support Wallace and the Progressive Party!</p>
<p>In the Progressive Party's manifesto, it also specifically emphasized protecting the rights and interests of Jews and blacks, abolishing all restrictions on "human rights," opposing the "poll tax" in the South, strictly prohibiting lynching murders, and abolishing racial discrimination. In the foreign policy platform, it also clearly stipulated full support for the newly established "Jewish state" and immediately granting the Jewish state a large loan.</p>
<p>Wallace can become the spiritual leader of black and Jewish Americans today, which may be something he never dreamed of. In fact, if you trace the roots, there is also a consistent thread. Wallace was originally the so-called left wing of the Democratic Party in the era of Roosevelt's consolidation of power. He advocated being close to the Soviet Union, advocating state-owned industry, and advocating socialism. This is in stark contrast to the traditional American democratic spirit and the traditional spirit of "free enterprise and free competition." Wallace is determined to break the "status quo." Therefore, all Americans who are dissatisfied with the status quo naturally gather around Wallace, which is also a natural phenomenon. Wallace's political program and policies are like a general store. Anything that is considered unsatisfactory in today's American governance is recorded and becomes the Progressive Party's political program for reform. To express it in a Chinese idiom, it is called "singing the opposite tune." Wallace's newsreels are cheered and applauded by many people in theaters, which is why!</p>
<p>For example, the US immigration law, especially the immigration law specifically for Asians, is something our Chinese people have always been dissatisfied with. But the Republican or Democratic parties have never mentioned in their political programs and policies improving the harsh rules for Chinese immigrants. Only this Wallace's Progressive Party specifically mentioned it. In the Progressive Party's manifesto, it also advocates for national health insurance, advocates for food rationing, abolishes labor laws that restrict the interests of workers, nationalizes heavy industry, overthrows trusts, and also mentions that the Constitution guarantees the Communist Party's freedom of activity, and advocates for abolishing the special investigation and statistics committees in Congress.</p>
<p>At this very time, President Truman broke historical precedent and convened a special session of Congress. Due to the confession of Bentley, a female spy of the Comintern, a so-called espionage case that shocked the world broke out. The US Congress's Special Investigation Committee (originally translated as the Committee for Investigating Those Disloyal to the United States) is not only not despised by Wallace, but also has power beyond the sky and is exerting a rare power in the American administrative system. Ms. Bentley, in the investigation court of the Congressional Special Committee, identified Wallace's right-hand men—Pan Lu and Coler—as Soviet spies. Pan Lu was promoted by Wallace in the past and served in the War Production Board. He is now Wallace's campaign aide. Bentley said that he had stolen statistics from the War Production Board and reported them to Moscow. Bentley also said that the great political commentator Lippmann used to have a personal female secretary who was also a communist. Bentley and this female communist had stolen Lippmann's confidential information. This female communist is now the secretary-general of Wallace's Progressive Party state party department in South Carolina. Chambers, an editor of the American magazine Time, also rushed to the Washington Congressional Investigation Committee to testify after hearing Bentley's "confession." Chambers used to be a communist and withdrew a long time ago. Chambers said that one of Wallace's key cadres, Plesman, and his wife, Sophia, are 100% communists. Plesman used to be the secretary of the American Federation of Labor. He quit his secretary job with a $19,000 annual salary to work as Wallace's campaign aide. When the Progressive Party held its founding convention in Philadelphia, Plesman was the secretary of the declaration drafting committee, and his wife, Sophia, was the person in charge of helping Wallace in the women's sector.</p>
<p>A few days ago, American national secret detectives broke into Wallace's "central party headquarters" at 39 Park Avenue in New York, ransacked the place, and conducted a major search. This angered the 60-year-old "great thinker." Wallace has made several speeches in a row these days. He said that the Congress controlled by the Republican Party is creating an "era of terror" that is unprecedented in history. The American people should unite to protest the "atrocities" of the Republican Congress! "To protect the dignity of the American Constitution and to fight for the right to personal freedom, we must protest the Republican Congress!"</p>
<p>Wallace's protests have had no response. On the contrary, the espionage case is becoming more and more extensive, even to the point that Molotov was "furious" in Moscow, and Ambassador Pan Youxin rushed to the US State Department at six o'clock in the morning to protest. US-Soviet relations are moving on the edge of a cliff. What impression will this give millions of American voters of the "Progressive Party" that advocates for Wallace to be close to the Soviet Union and the Communist Party?</p>

<h3>Focus of Chinese and Foreign Attention, Packed Audience; Public Trial of Defeated General Okamura for the First Time; Cunning Confessions Attempt to Shirk Responsibility; Lawyers and Prosecutors Engage in Heated Debate; Court Orders Postponement for Retrial</h3>
<p>[Report from This Newspaper] Okamura Yasuji, the top Japanese war criminal who served as the commander-in-chief of the China Expeditionary Army during the war, was publicly tried by the military court in the City Council Hall yesterday. More than 700 leaders from Chinese and foreign circles and others attended the packed audience. From 9:30 AM to 12:00 PM and from 3:00 PM to 6:30 PM, in addition to interrogating Okamura Yasuji and summoning four Japanese division and brigade commanders, including Ochiai Kyūkurō, who had already been convicted, the prosecutors and defense lawyers engaged in fierce debates from their respective standpoints. Because this case is one of the most important since the trial of war criminals, the court declared a postponement of the trial for special solemnity so that it could be studied in detail and achieve fairness. The date of the retrial will be publicly announced separately after it is decided.</p>
<p>At around 8 o'clock yesterday morning, Okamura Yasuji and witnesses Ochiai Kyūkurō, commander of the 27th Division, Hishida Genshirō, commander of the 116th Division, Nashioka Hisao, commander of the 55th Brigade, and Funabiki Masayuki, commander of the Changsha Garrison, were escorted to the court by members of the military court from the war criminal prison. Police and security guards lined up at the gate of the City Council and in the courtroom on the third floor, with strict security. The court session opened on time at 9:30, with Judge Shi Meiyu presiding. Judges Lu Qi, Zhang Tikun, Ye Zaizeng, Lin Jianpeng, Prosecutor Shi Yong (responsible for the indictment portion in the morning), Chief Prosecutor Wang Jiamei (responsible for the debate portion in the afternoon), Clerk Ding Xiang'an, Interpreters Wang Renming, Huang Wenzheng, Luo Di, Defense Lawyers Jiang Yiping, Yang Peng, and Qian Longsheng. Okamura Yasuji was first brought forward, wearing a military casual uniform with a turned-down collar and a white shirt. He was in better spirits than during the last investigation court. After the court investigated his age, place of origin, and resume, Okamura was allowed to sit down, and the prosecutor read the indictment. After reading, Judge Shi began to ask questions, and Okamura calmly replied. To the point that the court asked whether Doihara was the mastermind of launching the invasion of China, he replied that he did not know because he was serving in the Personnel Section of the Army Ministry at the time, and he did not participate in the launch of the war of aggression against China or the Greater East Asia Policy. He claimed that this was probably the idea of ​​the young officers, and that he himself was a predecessor of the young officers. From the July 7th Lugouqiao Incident until the Japanese army invaded Nanjing, he was always the commander of the 2nd Division in Harbin, and he was not transferred to participate until the Battle of Wuhan, when he was appointed commander of the 11th Army, commanding four divisions. At the time of the Pearl Harbor Incident, he was transferred to Beiping as the commander of the North China Area Army. On November 26, 1944, he was ordered to be promoted to commander-in-chief of the Expeditionary Army, and he took over on December 2 until the surrender. During these eight months, his mission was to prevent the US military from landing on the east coast and to concentrate the troops in the Xianggan inland in Jinghu, so there were no large-scale battles in China. At that time, the Japanese army, except for those in Northeast China, Taiwan, and Vietnam, was under his jurisdiction. He did not know about the crimes committed by the 23rd Army under Lieutenant General Tanaka Hisaichi when it burned the city of Liuzhou when it retreated from Guizhou and Guangxi, and the massacre of civilians by the 27th Division commander Ochiai Kyūkurō and others. After taking office as commander-in-chief, he ordered his subordinates to prevent criminal acts. He expressed his deep apology on behalf of the Japanese people to the Chinese who had been harmed, but he did not admit that he should be held responsible as an accomplice, because the division commander had a corps commander and an area army commander above him before reaching the commander-in-chief.</p>
<p>Summoning Witnesses, Funabiki Masayuki Defends Himself</p>
<p>At this point, the court summoned witnesses Ochiai Kyūkurō, Hishida Genshirō, and Funabiki Masayuki (the above three were sentenced to life imprisonment for condoning their subordinates' massacres and robberies), and Nashioka Hisao (sentenced to 15 years of imprisonment for destroying property and looting). Among them, Funabiki Masayuki requested to speak, and the court agreed. Funabiki Masayuki took out a pre-written long article from his arms and read it aloud, meaning that Okamura had instructed him to strictly enforce military discipline and that printed materials with the instruction "Thoroughly Love the People" were distributed to the army and read aloud in the morning and evening. Okamura also amended the military law, stipulating that rape was not subject to prosecution unless there was a complaint, and that the offender would be sentenced to death. All of this can prove that Okamura should not be held responsible as an accomplice. Funabiki Masayuki then defended himself against the crime for which he had been sentenced. The court stopped him because he had been speaking for too long and asked him to pause and speak again in the afternoon.</p>
<p>Situation After Japan's Surrender</p>
<p>So we continued to ask Okamura Yasuji about the situation after Japan's surrender. Okamura claimed that at that time, there were about one million Japanese troops in China. After the surrender, there was no act of disobeying the order, but they fought with the New Fourth Army, with more than 10,000 casualties, because the New Fourth Army intended to disarm them. He ordered that no weapons should be handed over to other troops except the Central Army. In addition, at the time of surrender, there was a unit of unknown number that intended to take over Nanjing. In order to maintain law and order, he also opened fire on them. He reported these two matters to the Chinese military authorities, who believed that the disposal was very appropriate. After that, he served as the director of the Japanese officers and soldiers' post-war liaison class, handling the repatriation and retention of personnel. He has suffered from lung disease since last October and has not recovered to this day.</p>
<p>Presiding Judge Asks About Impressions of China</p>
<p>Judge Shi then asked what his thoughts were on the Japanese militarists' policy of invading the world, and what his personal impressions of China were? Okamura said: Regarding the invasion of China, he fundamentally disagreed with it when he was young, but because soldiers took obedience as their duty, he had to come by order of the headquarters. The stability of East Asia must depend on the prosperity of China, so after the surrender, he ordered his subordinates to do their best to assist the Chinese government.</p>
<p>When the court convened in the afternoon, Funabiki Masayuki continued to defend his own crimes. After the conclusion, the court allowed the defendant's defense lawyer Jiang Yiping to directly ask the witnesses about the organization of the Japanese army and the issue of military discipline responsibility. The conclusion was that the commander-in-chief was responsible for strategic deployment, and the military discipline of each division was the responsibility of the regimental commander, battalion commander, and company commander, who were responsible at different levels, and the division commander was responsible for the overall result. The commander-in-chief can transfer the division commander but has no right to dismiss the division commander.</p>
<h3>Prosecutor Lists Five Arguments; Defendant Failed to Prevent or Stop War Crimes</h3>
<p>The debate then began, starting with a statement by Chief Prosecutor Wang Jiamei. He listed five arguments: (1) The reasons stated in the indictment, the defendant did not prevent his subordinates from carrying out massacres, robberies, and destruction of property everywhere, and he did not promptly stop them afterward. According to Article 9 of the Regulations on the Trial of War Criminals, he should be held responsible as an accomplice. (2) The wording of Article 9 is "Those who are in a position of supervision and guidance and fail to prevent or stop war crimes to the best of their ability shall be considered as accomplices." The defendant was the commander-in-chief of the Expeditionary Army and was naturally in a position of supervision and guidance. Since the War of Resistance, the crimes of the Japanese army are too numerous to mention. The defendant should have known about them. Although he said that he had ordered prevention after taking office as commander-in-chief, there were still crimes in fact, which shows that he did not do his best. (3) The defendant's reply stated that he was only responsible for national strategy, but the strategy he implemented was a war of aggression. The starting point was wrong, and the defendant, after taking office as commander-in-chief, still frantically attacked Guizhou and Guangxi, opened up the Yuehan South Road, and disturbed southern Henan and northern Hubei. He should be held responsible for the crime of destroying peace. (4) The trial of war criminals is not an act of emotion, nor is it to retaliate against the Japanese army or individuals, but to punish the invading country so that there will be no more wars of aggression and to safeguard world peace. (5) The court's prosecution of the defendant only selected the crimes of his subordinates that were obvious and had solid evidence. In fact, the defendant had fought in China before serving as commander-in-chief. How could his crime be limited to this? However, the defendant assisted our government in receiving the army at the time of surrender and made a slight contribution to our country's situation. Therefore, it is hoped that the judge will measure the crime and impose a punishment to balance it.</p>
<h3>Defense Attorney Refutes Two Points; Requests Court to Acquit</h3>
<p>Defense attorney Jiang Yiping was the first to refute the prosecutor's arguments, specifically analyzing the terms "in a position of command and supervision" and "failed to do their utmost" in Article 9 of the War Crimes Trial Regulations upon which the indictment was based. He argued: (1) Although the defendant was the commander-in-chief, his command could reach distant locations, but supervision should be the responsibility of each level, only reaching the soldiers through officers at each level. (2) Even if the defendant had both responsibilities, it should be judged whether he had done his utmost to prevent and stop the crimes. According to witnesses, the defendant had warned his subordinates not to disturb the people, issued slogans of "no killing, no burning, no offense," printed proclamations of love for the people and issued orders to the army to obey them, and abolished the requirement of a victim's accusation for rape cases to increase the severity of the punishment. All of these showed that the defendant had done his utmost to prevent crimes. May I ask, as the commander-in-chief issuing orders, what other methods could the defendant use to perform his duties besides verbal and written instructions? Therefore, the defendant has indeed done his utmost, and he should not be held responsible for the results. (3) The trial of criminals should focus on evidence. The defendant should not be convicted simply because he was a commander-in-chief. The young officers who launched the invasion of China are still avoiding the law, but the principal culprits are not caught, and the defendant is being prosecuted simply because he was the commander-in-chief. This would not only make the real culprits laugh, but also cause the dignity of the law to be lost. Now that the defendant has presented various counter-evidences, for the sake of the world's morality, international opinion, and the maintenance of peace, please, your honor, declare the defendant not guilty.</p>
<p>The other two defense attorneys, Qian Longsheng and Yang Peng, also defended the defendant successively. Attorney Qian believed that the defendant only bore strategic responsibility, that command belonged to the General Headquarters, and that supervision should be the responsibility of the Minister of the Army. The various crimes committed by the Japanese army, such as massacres, were all accidental rather than planned, and the defendant could not prevent accidental events. Attorney Yang discussed the policy of trying war criminals and also asked the court to declare the defendant not guilty.</p>
<h3>Whether Utmost Effort Was Made Is the Focus of Debate</h3>
<p>The prosecutor and attorney Jiang Yiping debated again. The prosecutor said: The so-called "doing one's utmost" has varying degrees. If the defendant could truly implement military orders, he might have been able to prevent the crimes. The defendant claimed ignorance of the various crimes committed by the Japanese army, which was self-deception. He hoped that the court would have the courage to conduct a fair trial, otherwise, if it only went through the motions and declared him not guilty, how could they face the suffering people? Defense attorney Jiang Yiping said: The so-called doing one's utmost is a question of whether one has indeed done so or simply acted perfunctorily. From a legal standpoint, what other methods could Okamura have used to fulfill his duty besides issuing orders and warnings to his subordinates? May I ask, was Okamura preparing to use his warnings to his subordinates as evidence in court today? If there is evidence in law, a guilty verdict should naturally be given, but the defendant cannot be found guilty simply because he was the commander-in-chief. Therefore, he still requested the court to make a fair judgment based on a position of no leniency and no retaliation.</p>
<p>It was already 6:30, and the presiding judge announced that for the sake of solemnity, the trial could not be concluded hastily in one session and decided to adjourn it temporarily, rescheduling it for another hearing. The defendant and witnesses were taken back into custody.</p>
<h3>New Lending Rates Still High; Industrial Circles Deem It Inappropriate</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] A reporter recently interviewed a qualified person in industrial circles, who expressed strong support for the government's decisive reform of the currency system and various economic measures. However, regarding the lending rate decided by the banking, money, and trust industries the day before, with a monthly interest rate as high as 1.5%, while the highest interest rate for interbank loans before the war did not exceed 0.15%, he believed that since the authorities are now working hard to suppress prices and trying to restore them to pre-war standards, it is inappropriate for the interest rate to be as high as ten times the pre-war rate. This will inevitably have a serious impact on future prices. The generation of high-interest loans during and after the war was based on malignant inflation. Now that the currency system has been reformed, the issuance of gold yuan notes is strictly limited, currency credit has been restored, and prices have stabilized, there is no reason for interest rates to remain so high. High-interest loans are particularly unfavorable to the industrial sector, directly affecting the cost of manufacturing goods. Therefore, it is hoped that the government will pay attention to this issue as soon as possible, crack down on high-interest loans, and at the same time open up industrial loans to support industry and commerce, increase production, and stabilize prices; otherwise, it may be difficult to achieve the desired results.</p>

<h3>Deputy Minister of Finance Xu Baiyuan Returns to Beijing; Inspects the Mint Before Departure</h3>
<p>Xu Baiyuan, the Deputy Minister of Finance, came to Shanghai from Beijing a few days ago and exchanged views with relevant authorities on various measures in the implementation of the new economic reform plan, and attended several important meetings. Having completed his official duties, he took the night train back to Beijing on the 23rd. Before his departure, Mr. Xu also visited the Central Mint in person at 6 p.m. It is reported that the subsidiary coins ordered to be minted by the factory, in addition to the 20-cent, 10-cent, and 5-cent nickel coins, have been completed and shipped to various important cities one after another. A large number of them will be available in the market in this city within days. The remaining 1-cent steel coins and 50-cent silver coins are also being prepared and are expected to be completed in one or two months.</p>
<h3>Banks Busy Exchanging Foreign Currencies and Gold and Silver; Central Bank Staff Work Through the Night; Total Amount Collected to Be Announced Today</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Yesterday, the Central Bank and other entrusted banks began exchanging foreign currencies, gold, and silver coins. The results were unexpectedly good. Due to the large amount of exchanges, even at 10 p.m., not only had the Central Bank itself not finished settling, but the original data from some entrusted banks had not yet been collected and submitted. The staff of the Central Bank's Business Bureau worked through the night to complete the work of the day. According to reports, the final settlement will not be completed until after midnight. Although they dare not estimate the numbers lightly, they can guarantee that it is quite considerable. These statistics will be officially released today.</p>
<p>When the exchange began yesterday, in addition to the Central Bank directly exchanging foreign currencies, it also entrusted the Bank of China, Bank of Communications, Farmers Bank of China, Mercantile Bank of India, and Chase Bank to exchange them on its behalf. For gold, in addition to the Central Bank, it also entrusted the trust departments of the Bank of China, Bank of Communications, and Farmers Bank of China to exchange them on its behalf. Silver coins were temporarily exchanged directly by the Central Bank. When the exchange began at 9 a.m., the Central Bank and the Bank of China were already packed with people and extremely crowded. Under the guidance of the management, they formed lines and proceeded in order, and the order was generally good. By evening, according to general estimates, the Central Bank had exchanged more than 30,000 yuan in silver coins and about 10,000 taels of gold. For US dollars, the Central Bank exchanged about US$60,000 in the morning, and more than that in the afternoon. The trust department of the Bank of China also exchanged about US$150,000. The details of foreign banks are unknown. By category, the most exchanged was gold, followed by foreign currency, and then silver dollars. Most of those who sold gold were banks and firms in urgent need of funds, with some single transactions involving as many as twenty or thirty gold bars. The trust department of the Bank of China limited its exchange work to foreign currencies yesterday. Except for one case of counterfeit banknotes being discovered, everything else went smoothly. Because there were too many people exchanging, the procedures for checking banknotes were very tedious, so they had to limit it to 400 people. Many who came to exchange waited all day, relying only on dry food to satisfy their hunger. In terms of the amount, the majority were between one hundred and two hundred yuan, with occasional cases as high as thirty or forty thousand yuan, but there were only two such transactions in total. According to on-the-spot investigations by reporters, the motives of those who came to exchange were nothing more than two: one was that banks and firms whose daily operations were not very sound were eager to allocate funds and had no choice but to reluctantly part with the gold and banknotes they had treasured; the other was that the exchange rate for gold and banknotes was already the same as the black market rate, while the wholesale prices of other commodities, such as cotton yarn and longcloth, were lower than the prices before the currency reform. Merchants who usually used gold and banknotes as chips did not want to leave their funds idle, so they voluntarily sold them to obtain gold yuan notes in order to replenish other goods. Regardless of the situation, the Central Bank had the opportunity to exchange a large amount of gold, silver, and foreign currency to replenish the reserve fund for the new currency.</p>
<h3>Bureau Chief Wu of the Social Affairs Bureau Inspects Various Markets; Informs Market Managers to Comply with the Fixed Prices of August 19</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Wu, the Bureau Chief of the Social Affairs Bureau, inspected various markets in the city yesterday morning together with Gu Bingyuan, the Director of the Economic Administration Department. He ordered that the prices of various daily necessities must not exceed the market prices of the 19th of this month, and that violators would be severely punished. Because of the tight schedule yesterday morning, he only inspected the flour, oil, sugar, and north-south rice markets. At each market, he summoned the market managers to inform them that they must ensure compliance with the market price standards of the 19th of this month and must not raise prices arbitrarily. He also stated: If there are any violations of the regulations, and sales are conducted at prices exceeding the regulations, not only will both the buyer and seller be punished, but the market managers will also be held jointly responsible.</p>
<p>The Social Affairs Bureau notified all trade associations in the city yesterday to submit a list of the prices of various commodities on the 19th of this month to the bureau for reference. After the currency reform order was promulgated, the most severely inflated prices were for vegetables and fresh meat. In order to curb the surge in prices, the Social Affairs Bureau is scheduled to convene a meeting with the heads of the vegetable, fresh meat, beef and mutton, chicken and duck, local produce, and fish markets at 10 a.m. today, and a meeting with the heads of department stores at 11 a.m. He instructed the industries to voluntarily reduce the increased prices, otherwise they will be severely punished. Representatives from relevant agencies, including the police, finance, and health bureaus, were also invited to participate.</p>
<p>Price Lists Will Be Posted in Various Markets</p>
<p>The price of vegetables fluctuated again in the market yesterday morning. The Social Affairs Bureau will post price lists in various markets from today, indicating the prices of various commodities on August 19, converted to gold yuan notes. Those who exceed this price will be punished, and citizens can report them to the police at any time, and their licenses will be revoked.</p>
<p>Economic Police Deployed Yesterday; Butchers Warned</p>
<p>The City Police Bureau dispatched all economic police officers yesterday morning to the north-south rice markets, yarn and cloth markets, fuel markets, and various daily necessities markets to monitor transactions. They also went to various shops and vegetable markets with police officers from various branch bureaus to investigate whether their selling prices exceeded the prices of the 19th. The general situation was very good, but the prices in the vegetable market were still very chaotic. A butcher surnamed Zhang at No. 226 Ninghai Middle Road was arrested for raising the price of meat. More than ten other vegetable vendors were arrested and warned by the Huangpu Branch Bureau.</p>

<h3>Public Education Difference Pay for August Approved; Staff Receive 10.5 Gold Yuan</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The Shanghai Public Education Personnel Material Supply Committee held its 23rd meeting at the City Hall yesterday, presided over by Secretary-General Shen. It was decided that the rice loan and difference pay for public education personnel this month would be: Staff: three dou of rice, converted to a rice loan of 4.2 gold yuan; two units of coal briquettes, converted to a difference pay of 4.8 gold yuan; three jin of cooking oil, converted to a difference pay of 1.5 gold yuan; totaling 10.5 gold yuan. Technicians would receive 9.1 gold yuan, and laborers would receive 5.95 gold yuan.</p>
<h3>Jewelry Stores Flourish; Busy Exchanging Gold Jewelry</h3>
<p>On the first day of the issuance of the gold yuan note, the business of major jewelry stores in the city suddenly became busy on the 23rd. According to Manager Qiu Tianbao, most jewelry stores were buying gold jewelry, and few were selling it. This is because the general public believed that exchanging one tael of gold jewelry for 190 gold yuan notes was not a loss, so those who needed cash rushed to jewelry stores to exchange it.</p>
<h3>Thoroughly Implement Emergency Plan; Defeat Enemies on the Economic Battlefield; Jiang Jingguo Addresses Officers of the Pacification and Construction Brigade</h3>
<p>Jiang Jingguo, who was ordered to come to Shanghai to assist in supervising the implementation of the economic reform plan, addressed the officers of the Pacification and Construction Brigade yesterday, giving instructions on the current emergency economic reform work. He said in brief: The first step in this policy is to mobilize the broad masses to participate in the implementation automatically, and to gain the support and cooperation of people from all walks of life, so that it can be effectively implemented. The crimes of enemies on the economic battlefield in the rear, such as speculators and hoarders, price manipulators, and those who seek bribes and pervert the law, are no different from those of enemies on the battlefield in the front. To make the reform policy effective, it is necessary to use the power of society and launch the sanctions of public opinion to completely eliminate them. Secondly, everyone is equal before the law. The more wealthy and powerful people are, the more severely they should be punished once they violate the law, and legitimate industrial and commercial operators must be effectively protected. The main points are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Eliminate Enemies in the Rear; Achieve Perfect Results</p>
<p>The emergency financial and economic measures recently promulgated by the President are an important policy for stabilizing social order and improving the people's lives. This policy is necessary and correct for dealing with the current economic situation. It not only concerns the personal lives of everyone, but also determines the life and death of the entire country and nation. Therefore, to support this policy is to support the interests of the country and to protect the interests of the people; to oppose this policy is to oppose the interests of the country and to help the public enemies of the people. After the policy is set, it should be implemented thoroughly and effectively. In the process of implementation, two points must be paid attention to: First, all government measures should take the interests of the majority of the people as their interests, and the broad masses must be mobilized to participate in the implementation. Only in this way can the policy take effect more quickly and be guaranteed success. Because the enemy on the military battlefield in the front is the Communist bandit, and everyone has seen his atrocities, while the enemy on the economic battlefield in the rear—such as those speculators and hoarders, price manipulators, and corrupt merchants and officials—are not easily detected. However, their crimes are no different from those of treacherous bandits. The only difference is that the murders and robberies of bandits are tangible, while the arson and murder of treacherous merchants and corrupt officials are intangible. Our Shanghai citizens with a sense of justice should recognize the true faces of the enemies in the rear and jointly sanction them and eliminate them. We believe that a large-scale national economic struggle cannot rely solely on the power of the government; we must also fully use the power of society, especially the power of the people, to completely eliminate the enemies in the rear and achieve perfect results.</p>
<p>Severely Punish Those Who Violate the Law; Protect Those Who Abide by the Law</p>
<p>Secondly, government orders must be obeyed by the people. Everyone should be equal before the law. I deeply feel that in the past, most of those who truly abided by the law were the poor, while the rich and powerful often escaped the law and did whatever they wanted. As the people of Shanghai say, "There must be a bar to have reason." The so-called bar refers to gold bars, and reason refers to the truth. The so-called "having a bar and having reason" means that having gold bars is the truth. This dark phenomenon is the main reason for the blurring of right and wrong in society today, and we must completely eliminate it. In Shanghai, it should be the case that no matter how much wealth you have or how much power you have, once you violate the law, you must be sent to prison and executed without mercy. Only then can justice be upheld, the law be enforced, and the people be convinced. However, while those who violate the law should be severely punished, we must fully protect the law-abiding and self-loving industrial and commercial operators so that industry and commerce can develop and prosper normally.</p>
<p>Practically Assume Responsibility; Jointly Seek Economic Stability</p>
<p>We can no longer gloss over the situation today, but must honestly admit that the country and the people are in the most dangerous and painful situation. Our highly paid officials should reflect deeply at this time, seize the opportunity, and do their best to serve the country and the people. As the saying goes, "Eat whose rice, do whose work." Since we eat the people's rice, we should do things for the people. As for the people themselves, they should also understand that today is the last moment for the survival of the country. Only if everyone is of one mind and united, abides by the law, and supports the national policy can we reverse the crisis with the greatest patience and the best efforts.</p>
<p>The environment in Shanghai is complex, and it is not easy to do a good job, but I believe that as long as we are not afraid of the oppression of power and the temptation of money, there will be nothing that cannot be done.</p>
<p>Recalling the hardships and dangers of the Anti-Japanese War, and seeing the suffering that the country is encountering today, one cannot help but feel infinite emotion. The suffering of our country and people is too deep. However, all difficult fates can only be transformed from danger to safety, from sorrow to joy, from bitterness to sweetness, and from darkness to light through perseverance and struggle. Such a great cause as the Anti-Japanese War has already been won under the leadership of the President, and such a powerful enemy as Japan has also been defeated by us under the leadership of the President. Then, can today's suppression of rebellion not be completed satisfactorily? Indeed, today is no longer the time to shirk responsibility, evade responsibility, or blame each other, but to strengthen confidence, abide by laws and regulations, support national policies, practically assume responsibility, and jointly seek the stability of the national economic life in order to complete the great cause of suppressing rebellion and building the country.</p>
<h3>An Accident Occurs During a "Bank Run"; A Thousand Yuan is Missing in an Instant; Who Should Be Responsible?</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] When the Central Bank was exchanging gold yesterday, a staff member of a certain company who was very young held gold worth 7,000 gold yuan for exchange. After leaving the counter, he suddenly discovered that there was a shortage of 1,000 gold yuan. He was greatly shocked at the time and urgently negotiated with the exchange personnel. The person in charge told him that since he had left the counter, the bank was not responsible. However, he agreed to check the accounts at night and if there was an extra 1,000 yuan, it might be a mistake in the rush and could be made up. However, when the accounts were cleared at night, no extra amount was found, and the staff member was still afraid to leave the exchange location because of his responsibility. How this will be resolved in the future remains to be seen.</p>
<h3>U.S. Consul Admonishes Colleagues to Cooperate in Promoting the New Currency System; Cabot Also Expresses Praise</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] In order to show full cooperation with the implementation of the new currency system in our country, Mr. Cabot, the U.S. Consul General in Shanghai, issued a memorandum to all his colleagues in the consulate yesterday, sincerely advising them to pay attention to cooperation.

<h3>Economic Supervision and Reporting Meeting Discusses the Focus of Work; Strict Inspection Will Be Implemented on the Movement of Materials, Funds and Banknotes</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Yu Hongjun and Jiang Jingguo, the supervisors of the Shanghai District of the Economic Supervision Committee of the Executive Yuan, held their first economic supervision and reporting meeting at the Central Bank yesterday afternoon at 4 p.m. Wu Guozhen, Pan Gongzhan, Xu Baiyuan, Fang Zhi, Xuan Tiewu, Wu Kaixian, Yu Shuping, Lin Chongyong, Li Lixia, and others attended. The meeting lasted until 6 p.m. According to a certain person who attended the meeting, the reporter said: In today's meeting, the specific details of how to implement the various points stipulated in the new measures and the division of work were carefully studied. The focus of future work will be to stabilize prices with all efforts. Personnel will be dispatched to conduct strict inspections at land and water transportation agencies regarding the movement of materials, funds and banknotes. If there are any leaks, they will be severely punished, and will be confiscated if necessary.</p>
<h3>Technical Issues of Wage Calculation; Assessment Committee to Discuss Within Days; Minister Gu Returns to Beijing Last Night After Completing Official Duties</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Wu Kaixian, the Director of the Social Affairs Bureau, hosted a banquet yesterday for Gu Zhenggang, the Minister of Social Affairs, who came to Shanghai on official business. Deputy Director Zhao Banfu and the heads of various departments accompanied him. During the banquet, they asked Minister Gu for instructions on wage issues. According to Minister Gu, the standards for wage payment after the currency reform have been clearly stipulated in Article 22 of the central government's measures for reorganizing finances and strengthening economic control. The Ministry of Social Affairs has no supplementary measures for this. As for the technical details, they should be handled by the Municipal Labor-Management Assessment Committee through consultation. Subsequently, everyone put forward their opinions. The treatment of employees in various industries in this city, in addition to those who are paid according to the current index, also includes those who are paid according to the previous index, or the average index of the previous and current periods, and those who are paid after deducting the excessively high base salary. They also exchanged opinions on how to calculate technical issues such as overtime, work stoppages, reduced work, and piecework. The discussions were very detailed, but no concrete conclusions were reached. The Social Affairs Bureau is scheduled to convene a labor-management assessment committee within two or three days to discuss all issues.</p>
<p>Gu Zhenggang, the Minister of the Ministry of Social Affairs, has completed his official duties in Shanghai and returned to Beijing last night.</p>
<h3>Public Utilities Pricing Issues; Decision to Provide Opinions to the Central Government</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The Shanghai Municipal Public Utilities Public Investigation and Review Committee held its third meeting at the City Hall yesterday afternoon at 3 p.m., chaired by Mayor Wu. Zhao Cengjue, Li Wenjie, Pan Mingxin, Jiang Hao, Qu Yue, Jiang Haoran, He Yuanming, Zhang Chude, Yan E'sheng, Xiang Changquan, Zhang Rentao, and others attended. Mayor Wu first asked Deputy Director Zhang of the Public Utilities Bureau, who had just returned from attending the public utilities pricing conference in Nanjing, to report on the results of the conference. According to Zhang, when the public utilities pricing conference was held, it coincided with the central government's decision to implement currency reform. Now the Ministry of Industry and Commerce has scheduled a meeting on September 1 with relevant departments such as the Ministry of Communications and the Ministry of Interior to discuss the new price issues for public utilities after the currency reform. After the agreement is reached, it will be submitted to the Executive Yuan for approval, and will be announced and implemented nationwide simultaneously. Mayor Wu stated that since the central government has made a general decision on public utilities prices, the committee can wait for its decision. However, the public investigation must continue, and the review committee can be convened once a week. Subsequently, committee members Yan E'sheng and Jiang Haoran, among others, stated that before the central government makes a decision on public utilities prices, the committee should provide its opinions first, because the situation in Shanghai is different from other places, and the electricity supply is the highest in the country, which is of great importance. The following two resolutions were passed on the spot: (1) Support the central government's emergency measures plan for currency reform. (2) Formulate concrete opinions on public utilities prices and submit them to the central government for approval.</p>

<h3>Three Tonics for the Northeast</h3>
<p>— Special Correspondent of This Newspaper Han Qingtao</p>
<p>[Airmail Report from Jinzhou, 16th] Last year, the heavy snow in winter draped the Northeast in mourning, almost causing the heavily ill patient to stop the circulation of blood and suffocate. This year, the arrival of spring brought the patient some life-saving vitality. After a year of rest and stability, it has once again embarked on the road to survival. If the autumn does not cause it to lose the strength to cultivate vital energy, and the winter does not cut off its body, then the more it develops and stabilizes, the more salvation it will have. The magic bullet in reversing the tide of the situation lies in the central government's decision to create a policy of "three tonics." These three tonics are: abandoning unimportant strongholds, concentrating forces, and firmly defending the three major strongholds of Shenyang, Jinzhou, and Changchun, allowing them to fully exert their tonic effect.</p>
<p>The three-tonic policy has been successful. The attending physician is General Wei Lihuang, Commander-in-Chief of the Northeast Bandit Suppression, and he has a skilled assistant in Chief of Staff Zhao Jiaxiang, who has helped the Northeast recover from its chronic illness. The Political Affairs Committee of the Suppression Headquarters is also playing a significant role in politics and economics.</p>
<p>Currently, the Northeast is beginning a comprehensive war that combines military, political, and economic efforts, hoping to find a way out in its weakness.</p>
<p>Two Ports, One Line</p>
<p>Huludao has swallowed grain and flour for the Northeast and has also spat out steel and special products for the Northeast to exchange for money. At the same time, the army lands here and boards ships here, supporting both inside and outside the customs, playing a role in offense and defense. The navy cruises the Bohai Sea and also sails from here to the Liaodong Bay. Recently, the artillery fired on Yingkou, and a strong force has been deployed around Huludao. Thus, rumors have spread again that the Nationalist army will land in Yingkou to open up the route to southern Liaoning. This is a message that may become a reality, because the throats of the northeast are the ports of Huludao and Yingkou.</p>
<p>In order to open up the connection between Pan[yang] and the interior, landing in Yingkou is the most advantageous and convenient. Opening up the railway between Jinzhou and Pan[yang] is more difficult, not to mention that it is difficult to defend even if it is opened up. Of course, clearing southern Liaoning and guarding the Pan[yang]-Ying[kou] route will also require a lot of troops.</p>
<p>The Beining Railway is a line connecting the Northeast and the interior. This line, from Pan[yang] to Jinzhou, has been cut off. The Jinzhou to interior section is unimpeded. The reopening of the Shen[yang]-Jin[zhou] line is still pending. Currently, the air force is responsible for connecting the severed lines. Although the carrying capacity is small, the 45-minute flight is very convenient. This strong air force connects the lines and also soars over the vast sea-like surface of the Northeast.</p>
<p>Survival Lies in Western Liaoning</p>
<p>The Liaoxi Corridor has been a battlefield for military strategists to strive for victory since ancient times. They shed blood and sweat here, and the soldiers spent good times here. The Tang poem, "Strike the oriole, do not let it cry on the branch, the crying startles my dreams, and I cannot reach Liaoxi," is a chant of longing for the soldiers of Liaoxi.</p>
<p>This year, the Nationalists firmly grasp the Liaoxi Corridor, playing a major connecting role. Offense and defense can be used freely. At the same time, the ports of Huludao and the Beining Railway are where the survival of the Northeast lies.</p>
<p>General Fan Hanjie, Director of the Northeast Bandit Suppression Jinzhou Command, is stationed here. The Liaoxi Corridor, the eastern end of eastern Liaoning, including Qinhuangdao, is guarded by the heavy troops under his command. He carefully uses this base as preparation for an attack.</p>
<p>After Sun Du handed over the power of the Yunnan-originating corps to Lu Junquan, the original commander of the 93rd Army, the newly promoted corps commander, Lu Junquan, is diligently seeking progress and boosting morale, hoping to make this eagle-like team even more powerful. Diligence and hard work will pay off.</p>
<p>In politics, the Liaoning Provincial Government has specially set up a "Liaoxi Administrative Office" here, with He Kui (also Deputy Commander of the Anti-Banditry Command in the Ji-Re-Liao Border Area) as the director of the administrative office to carry out government affairs. Jin City, Jin County, Yang County, Jinxi, Xingcheng, and Suizhong are all under the command of the Liaoxi Administrative Office. He Kui said, "I am the bridge between the military and the civilians in Western Liaoning."</p>
<p>In order to strengthen the political, economic, and military coordination in Western Liaoning, the Political Affairs Committee of the Northeast Bandit Suppression Headquarters has specially dispatched an advisor, Wei Keng, to set up an office in Jin[zhou] so that the Northeast's overall war can be carried out smoothly. The sorghum is fat, and the soybeans are fragrant. This autumn, Western Liaoning will have a good harvest!</p>
<p>Eastern Hebei is connected to Western Liaoning. Bandits enter and exit the besieged city from Eastern Hebei, planning to cut off the traffic of the Beining Railway inside and outside the customs. The campaign to sweep Eastern Hebei in August was victorious, recovering Qian'an, Lulong, and Zunhua, forcing the bandits to stay away and suffer casualties. The bandit's attempt was completely crushed.</p>
<p>In this way, the section of the Beining Railway inside and outside the customs can be even more unobstructed. With the addition of Qinhuangdao and Huludao, which are exerting their import and export power, Jinzhou and Shenyang can be even more integrated. If Yingkou is recovered and Southern Liaoning is opened up, the situation can be greatly changed.</p>
<p>Changchun is isolated and suspended, but Zheng Dongguo, Deputy Commander of the Northeast Bandit Suppression, does not allow the besieging bandits to move one step further into the city. He leads about two armies and more people, enduring hunger and suffering, defending the city and exerting a great force to contain the bandits.</p>
<p>Flat, Bright Road</p>
<p>It is estimated that the Nationalist army in the Northeast has about 300,000 troops. There are about eight armies around Shenyang, about five armies in Western Liaoning and eastern Hebei, and about two armies in Changchun. The troops in Pan[yang] and Chang[chun] are mostly elite troops, while the troops in Western Liaoning are mostly new forces.</p>
<p>The bandit leader Lin Biao has the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th, 6th, 7th, 8th, 9th, 10th, 11th, and 12th Columns (whether the 5th and 12th Columns exist is still under investigation) of the field army and several independent divisions and regiments, as well as Mongolian cavalry, Hui Muslim, and Korean Communist detachments, plus local armed forces, claiming to have 500,000 men. The actual number is still difficult to determine.</p>
<p>Lin Biao deployed most of the bandit troops in northern Liaoning for reorganization and training, without any movement for more than half a year. In addition to some internal reasons why he dared not move, it was because many poor and remote areas had already been exhausted, so he had to eat and use it for a long time in northern Liaoning, which is known as the "granary of the Northeast."</p>
<p>Now, the bandit forces are extremely short of ammunition and food, so the bandits in the Northeast will not move unless they have to. The move must be when the sorghum is ripe. The move must be when there is an opportunity to take advantage of in order to solve the supply problem and find cheap solutions. After the autumn harvest in mid-September, it will be convenient to eat, grab guns, and move around. That may be when the bandits start to stir up trouble.</p>
<p>The Nationalist army is accumulating strength and energy, not launching attacks easily, and not changing the "three-point policy," so that the bandits have no gaps to attack and no opportunities to take advantage of. The current task is how to guarantee the autumn harvest, get through the winter, and then welcome a vibrant spring.</p>
<p>The main thing in the overall situation of the Northeast is to maintain the status quo, seeking development in stability. This year, there are still two major hurdles after the autumn harvest and in the snow and ice. After passing these, the road will become flatter and brighter.</p>
<h3>Changzhou Special Relief Donation - Only 193 Billion Collected</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper, Wujin 22nd] The special relief donation has been closed. Regarding the extremely wealthy who refuse to pay the special donation, the general assembly will be requested to punish them severely. The 25 billion assigned to Jiangyin has not yet been paid. The total amount of donations collected from local merchants and Shanghai merchants in our county is 193 billion yuan.

<h3>Changshu Park Bridge Case - Police Chief and University Students - Heated Debate for Two Hours</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper, Changshu 20th] Recently, the county has staged a strange drama due to the police bureau's forcible interference with college students from Shanghai who came to Changshu to conduct a survey and practice "Bridge" (card game). The local newspapers gave it a very prominent position, publishing a feature of thousands of words, analyzing the process of this "case," and it temporarily became a topic of conversation in the streets and alleys along with the new currency issue.</p>
<p>More than 20 students from the School of Engineering of St. John's University in Shanghai came to Changshu a week ago to practice surveying and assist in construction work. On the 20th, the preliminary work of surveying the Huan Shan Road outside the West was completed, so they gathered in Zhongshan Park, sat down between sipping tea, and played "Bridge" to relax. Unexpectedly, this alarmed the park police, who reported to the police bureau, believing that someone was openly gathering in a public place to gamble. Therefore, a patrol officer was dispatched to lead a large number of police officers to the scene to arrest them. After arriving, because the students did not admit that playing "Bridge" was a criminal act, and repeatedly stated that after searching through Chinese and foreign law codes, there had never been an explicit provision that Bridge players should be treated as perpetrators. Therefore, they only agreed to send two representatives to explain to the bureau chief. After arriving at the bureau, the two students stated that the nature of Bridge was the same as that of chess, and tried their best to explain the misunderstanding. However, Director Huang always believed that although the students did not gamble, they could be considered to have constituted "similar gambling" behavior and should be detained for seven days. Considering that the offenders were college students, they were exempted from prosecution. However, the student representatives believed that they had not committed any crime at all and refused to accept the director's "exemption from prosecution." When signing the record of interrogation, they also noted that they did not admit to being regarded as "perpetrators." After two hours of heated debate, the two sides stuck to their own words, and there was no result. Finally, the bureau ruled to destroy the playing cards. The students refused to accept this and expressed their intention to file an administrative lawsuit in accordance with the law. The future development of this case is worth watching.</p>

<h3>Gallnuts: The Season for Appearance</h3>
<p>— Our Reporter Liu Mengchi</p>
<p>[Report from Guiyang, from our newspaper on the 20th] A special product of Guizhou, an industrial raw material that parasitizes wild plants, is ubiquitous and requires no human cultivation. It can be used in modern organic chemical industries for medicines, pharmaceuticals, various organic dyes, and its economic value even exceeds that of the highly valued "Guizhou American Tobacco." Its name is "Gallnut."</p>
<p>It parasitizes a wild plant called "Salt Sumac," a type of insect gall formed after aphids reside on it. The so-called "Salt Sumac" belongs to the Sumac family and grows in the mountains of Yunnan and Guizhou. It is a deciduous tree, one to two zhang tall, with odd-pinnate compound leaves about a foot long. The leaflets are oblong-ovate, and the petiole has wings between the leaflets. In summer, small greenish-white flowers bloom at the tips, bearing small drupes densely covered with purple and white short hairs. As they mature, aphids gather, spreading salt-like powder on the surface and back of the leaves, building their nests, gradually forming tumor-like lumps, which turn reddish-brown when mature. These varying sizes are what we commonly call "Gallnuts." The reason why this wild plant is called "Salt Sumac" is explained by Li Shizhen in his "Compendium of Materia Medica" from the Ming Dynasty: "Its taste is salty, hence the name," and also "The outer skin of the drupe has a thin layer of salt, which children eat; the people of Yunnan and Sichuan consider it wood salt."</p>
<p>Statistical Dominance Before the War</p>
<p>Gallnuts are found throughout the counties of Guizhou, especially in areas close to Yunnan and Sichuan. Although villagers did not fully understand its use before the war, they picked and sold it in the city when they saw people buying it. Although the price was very low, it could supplement the household income in rural areas. According to pre-war global statistics, China ranked first in gallnut production, and Japan ranked second. Among the provinces in China, Guizhou and Yunnan had the largest output. Because Salt Sumac is very selective about soil and climate, the lunar June and July on the Yunnan-Guizhou Plateau are when the monsoon from the Indian Ocean brings moisture to the provinces, creating a humid climate ideal for Salt Sumac growth. By late summer and early autumn, it is the breeding season for aphids, and Salt Sumac grows all over the mountains and plains of Yunnan and Guizhou, producing large quantities of gallnuts. Before the opening of sea trade, villagers generally only knew that gallnuts were a not-so-valuable prize. After merchants from Japan and Germany came to China to purchase gallnuts in large quantities, the villagers realized that gallnuts were valuable.</p>
<p>Japanese and German Merchants Purchase and Return Home</p>
<p>Japanese and German merchants bought gallnuts and took them back to their countries, made them into finished products, and then shipped them back to China or sold them to various countries around the world, earning profits tens of thousands of times greater than their initial investment. At that time, China did not have refining factories, nor was anyone willing to invest in this type of chemical industry, so it completely relied on foreign finished products, watching others make money. During the Anti-Japanese War, international routes were blocked, and the need for gallnuts in China increased sharply. Huanghai Chemical Company and the Ministry of Military Affairs and the Ministry of Health made an order to produce subgallate, needing gallic acid as a supporting medicine, and then began to study the process of using gallnuts to produce gallic acid. For the first time in China, gallnuts were processed from raw materials into finished products. The factory was located in Nanchuan, Sichuan, to facilitate proximity to Yunnan and Guizhou for easy purchase of gallnuts. However, due to insufficient capital, a loan was taken from the Agricultural Bank, but the business declined, and the work was suspended. In the spring of the 30th year of the Republic, the Farmers Bank was requested to take over the operation, continuing small-scale operations to demonstrate advocacy. The finished product was named "Gallic Acid" to distinguish it from imported products, instead of using the transliteration of "Gallic Acid."</p>
<p>Common Uses Are Roughly Divided into Three Categories</p>
<p>Gallic acid has a wide range of uses, mostly in photography, ink, dyeing, papermaking, medicine, copperplate and lithography, electroplating, winemaking, and more. According to reports from Huanghai Chemical Company, the most common uses can be divided into three categories: (1) Organic chemical industrial pharmaceuticals, such as the manufacture of water, pyrogallic acid, benzoic acid, etc. (2) Pharmaceuticals, such as the manufacture of gallic acid methyl ester, gallic acid aluminum, iodoform, dermatol, subgallate, eurol, etc. (3) Organic dyes, such as the manufacture of Gamboge, alizarin green, gallic acid cyanine, etc.</p>
<p>Exporting Raw Materials, Importing Finished Products</p>
<p>In recent years, the trial production and sale of gallic acid in China have been very satisfactory. In important areas, there are already good sales channels. For example, Qinghua Pigment Factory, Dagong Dyeing and Weaving Factory, and Dacheng Dye Factory are the most scaled factories in Chongqing, and they all use it in large quantities. Others, such as the aircraft Research Institute’s deerskin making factory, and other small leather factories, ink factories, etc. are also happy to purchase it. After the gallic acid was produced, there were also plans for foreign sales. In the 33rd year of the Republic, Fuxing Company specially sent samples to the World Trading Company in the United States to explore the sales market in the United States. In the winter of that year, a reply was received from the company stating that after chemical testing, the quality was slightly inferior to the general quality in the United States, but the market was still marketable, and it was estimated that the price was about one US dollar per pound, delivered in New York at that time. In the 35th year of the Republic, Jardine Matheson, a British merchant stationed in Chongqing, sent samples to the UK for chemical testing, intending to order a large quantity for refined production in the UK. However, due to the limited inventory in our factory, it was abandoned. Foreigners are very concerned about the production and sales of gallnuts in China, and this is not only because gallic acid is now produced. As mentioned earlier, Japanese and German merchants have always purchased gallnuts in China. Before the war, they purchased at least 1.5 million dan in China every year, and the price was of course very low, but we still had to buy their finished products back at a very high price.</p>
<p>Blocked Outlets, Great Material Submerged</p>
<p>The production of gallnuts in Guizhou has gradually decreased in recent years. The reason is that the outlets are blocked, no one protects them, and no one pays attention to them. Even if they grow in the mountains, they are allowed to grow and die on their own, burying such useful materials, which is a real pity! Especially the ignorant villagers, relying on the old method of slash-and-burn agriculture, often set fires to burn the mountains before the vernal equinox, using grass ash as fertilizer, and opening up burned fields for cultivation, indiscriminately destroying the mountains and forests, burning the seeds of aphids, thereby reducing the production of gallnuts. In addition, in recent years, the chaos has been military busy, transportation tools are lacking, and freight rates are too high. The volume of gallnuts is large and the weight is small, occupying a larger position during transportation. General boat and vehicle transportation are calculated by cubic feet instead of their actual substance, merchants of course value the economic value of purchasing and exporting gallnuts is far behind the consumption of American tobacco, and even no one cares. These times, when the new gallnuts are coming on the market, the market price of new products is 40 million yuan per 100 jin, and the old products is 60 million yuan. Compared with the top gold leaf of Guiding American tobacco at 8 million yuan per 100 jin and the secondary yellow at 6.5 million yuan, things with economic value are so cheap, is it not strange!</p>
<p>Strictly Prohibit Burning Mountains, Set Up a Demonstration Factory</p>
<p>Gallnuts are useful products parasitizing wild plants. They do not require the hard work of cultivating, transplanting, fertilizing, etc. like American tobacco, and they are rich in international economic value and are the most needed raw materials for the national chemical industry. They should not be allowed to be buried for a long time. The reporter believes that the government authorities should at least earnestly achieve "Strictly prohibit burning mountains," so that the villagers know to protect Salt Sumac and the aphids on it, in order to increase the production of gallnuts. Secondly, small-scale demonstration factories should be set up in appropriate areas within Guizhou to teach Chenmin how to refine gallic acid.</p>

<h3>First Day of the Gold Yuan Issuance: Banks Crowded with Customers Making Deposits and Withdrawals; Financial Market Liquidity Stable, Slightly Tight Outside the Market</h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] Yesterday, the Gold Yuan began to be issued. Since banks were closed for three consecutive days, all sectors urgently needed to withdraw cash for their needs. Therefore, most banks were crowded with customers making deposits and withdrawals in the morning. However, each bank had already prepared cash in advance, and they actively collected overdue loans, so the liquidity within the financial market was very stable, while the liquidity of various industries outside the market was tight, and the black market rate was around six jiao (calculated in legal tender).</p>
<p>According to the results of the check clearing, the Four Banks, Two Offices, and One Treasury had a difference of 5,035,000 yuan, of which the Central Bank had a difference of 2,899,000 yuan. Large clearing had an inflow of 439,000 yuan from the Four Banks, and an inflow of 396,000 yuan from foreign businesses. Small clearing was balanced. The Bank of China had an outflow of 2,220,000 yuan, the Bank of Communications had an inflow of 336,000 yuan, the China Agricultural Bank had an outflow of 227,000 yuan, the Bank of Communications had an inflow of 52,000 yuan, the Postal Savings Bureau had an outflow of 122,000 yuan, and the Cooperative Treasury had an inflow of 45,000 yuan. The total number of checks cleared yesterday was 57,000, and the total amount cleared was approximately 93.37 million yuan, both of which were higher than before. In addition, due to the first-time use of Gold Yuan checks yesterday, there were many errors in all sectors, resulting in a particularly large number of returned checks. The entire calculation was cleared up at 11 o'clock, it is said.</p>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] Yesterday was the first day of the issuance of the Gold Yuan, and the foreign exchange market was quite calm. With the Gold Yuan exchange rate against foreign currencies now fixed, people in import and export sectors are becoming more calm and are not as eager to settle foreign exchange as before. Therefore, the amount of foreign exchange settlement is less than before. Throughout the day, the sale of export exchange certificates was greater, and the initial rate was 3.33 Gold Yuan, but the most transactions were made at 3.20 Gold Yuan.</p>
<p>The designated banks have decided to convene a meeting on the 25th to discuss everything, as there may be areas for improvement in various foreign exchange settlement procedures at the beginning of the implementation of the Gold Yuan.</p>
<h3>Public Sentiment Stable, Store Inventory Weak; Rice Prices Listless; Flour, Grains, Oil, and Cakes All Decline and Soften</h3>
<p>The rice market resumed trading yesterday. The market announced that prices were all standardized in Gold Yuan and stipulated that they should not exceed the prices of the 19th. Yesterday, public sentiment in the market was stable, and rice stores had very little inventory. At the beginning of the market, cargo owners listed prices in accordance with the prices of the 19th, but due to sluggish sales, the market declined, and due to the extreme shortage of silver, cargo owners actively sold, resulting in a drop in prices. Beishi white japonica rice was 20 yuan, and thin early rice and Yangxian rice each fell by about one yuan. Special high-quality japonica rice was 22 yuan, a decrease of 7 jiao. The closing price in Nanshi market also fell by 5 or 6 jiao. Yesterday, 5,717 shi arrived in the two markets.</p>
<p>Flour prices fell. After the currency system reform, public sentiment was very stable, and retail investors and actual sales were less involved. Sales channels were narrower, and the sudden tightening of silver made those holding goods eager to sell, so the closing price was even more fictitious. The opening price of Laoche flour was 7.25 yuan, but due to the continuous outflow, it entered within 7 yuan and closed at 6.85 yuan, a drop of 7 jiao. Bingchuan flour fell by 6 jiao, and each fell by about 10%. Miscellaneous brands of flour uniformly fell by 6 or 7 jiao, and bran opened at 5.2 yuan, a decrease of 3 or 4 jiao.</p>
<p>Miscellaneous grains began to be traded in Gold Yuan, but public sentiment was very stable, and guest merchants had very little interest. Sales channels were sluggish, but due to the tight silver, cargo owners sold a lot. The opening price of soybeans was still flat, but the closing price fell by 5 jiao due to the large drop in oil cakes. Hankou Zha beans fell within 10 yuan. Broad beans were still stable. Corn, Yuan wheat, and North wheat were not taken, falling by more than 10%. Tea bean transactions were almost extinct. Red grain has not been opened. Sesame prices were tired and stagnant. Cargo owners listed the price of raw kernels at one yuan lower, and Guang merchants ate the price at four yuan lower, so no transaction was made.</p>
<p>Cooking oil resumed trading, but due to sluggish actual sales and poor sales channels, and the sudden tightening of silver, cargo owners sold a lot, and prices therefore fell. Dayou soybean oil was 49 yuan, Dachangxin, etc. were 48.5 yuan, and raw rapeseed oil was 43 yuan, each falling by 3.5 yuan. Raw oil fell by 5.3 yuan, and Jilong raw oil was 58 yuan, and Xiaoche sesame oil was 50 yuan, a decrease of 5 yuan. Transactions were not active yesterday, and the market was very weak. Bean cakes had little activity, and prices fell by 5 jiao.</p>
<h3>Financial Management Strengthens Work, Extends Office Hours</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Financial Management Bureau has recognized that after the reform of the currency system and the strengthening of economic and financial controls, the bureau's responsibilities have become increasingly heavy. In particular, problems such as the increase in capital of banks, the deposit interest rate, and the use of funds for loans from national banks and bureaus cannot be effectively managed and supervised at the beginning of implementation. It is learned that the bureau has recently actively strengthened its work, and will increase its office hours by one hour from the 23rd of this month, from 8:00 a.m. to 12:00 p.m. and from 2:00 p.m. to 5:00 p.m. It has also expanded its organization and enriched the number of auditors to cope with the task. Yesterday, a large number of personnel were sent to various banks to monitor whether there were restrictions on withdrawals and other inappropriate situations.</p>
<h3>National Banks Support Peers, Specially Offer Temporary Interbank Loans</h3>
<p>Banks and money shops in the city were ordered to temporarily close for two days on August 20th and 21st, and officially reopened yesterday. At the same time, the government officially issued Gold Yuan across the country from yesterday, implementing a new monetary system. The Central Bank recognized that at the beginning of the implementation of the new monetary system, bank and money shop accounts were frequently paid, and a small number of banks and money shops may have difficulty in turning around funds. In order to support the industry, it is specially allowed for banks and money shops to temporarily use the 36th year US dollar public bonds, short-term treasury bills, and listed securities issued by the government to borrow Gold Yuan from national banks to meet temporary needs. However, the above-mentioned government securities must be owned by the banks and money shops themselves, and the listed stocks must be collateral for loans received by the banks and money shops, and there must be books and records for inspection.

<p>Yesterday, the cotton cloth market was in a state of hesitation due to the currency system reform, and the pressure was quite heavy. Local and foreign merchants sold their goods to each other, and retail investors were eager to sell due to the still high interest rates. Under the initial situation of multi-head selling pressure, the price of 12-pound Longtou fine cloth plummeted by more than 20%. In the middle, the platform merchants raised the price slightly, but soon there were more people selling at high prices, and it fell back to 25 yuan (75 million legal tender), ending the day, a decrease of about 15% compared to the closing price on the 19th.

The sentiment outside the market was mostly flat and tired, because it was rumored that Hong Kong woolen fabrics had arrived in abundance, and the market had plummeted, and it could continue to arrive in Shanghai soon. At the same time, due to the three consecutive days of closing the port, the silver root was tight, and the black market interest rate was chaotic. There was a lot of noise about tearing down the head and lining at the tea party. The price tags in Qipan Street were all changed to Gold Yuan, and business was quiet everywhere.</p>
<h3>Timber Stable</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the timber market price of domestic fir was not much different from the market price on the 19th, with the cash Gold Yuan quotation being 1.3 jiao per foot. However, due to the cancellation of the foreign exchange settlement certificate and the increase in foreign exchange, the quotation for foreign pine increased from 5.7 to 6 jiao per foot.</p>

<h3>Municipal Education Bureau Convened Yesterday Middle School Moral Education Discussion Meeting; Local Leaders Instruct on Points to be Paid Attention To</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The Shanghai Municipal Secondary School Moral Education Discussion Meeting convened by the Municipal Education Bureau was held yesterday morning at 9:00 AM at the Shanghai West Middle School. Attendees included over 100 moral education directors, physical education directors, and scout teachers from public and private secondary schools. Mayor Wu, Speaker Pan, and Chairman Fang all attended and gave instructions. First, Bureau Director Li of the Education Bureau clarified that the responsibility of moral education personnel is to guide students' extracurricular activities, and explained that the Education Bureau has formulated methods for guiding students' extracurricular activities as a guideline for promoting moral education in schools in the future. Mayor Wu said in his speech: The failure of education in our country in recent years lies in the lack of cultivation of principles of conduct among young people. Currently, most teachers see students as objects to be fed, while students see teachers as tools for imparting knowledge. There is no emotional connection between them, let alone guiding teachers who uphold morality, which greatly affects the revival of the nation and the country. He sincerely hoped that all those responsible for guidance could emulate Mr. Zhang Boling's teaching according to aptitude, deeply understand all the words and deeds of students, and then provide guidance, so as to tailor their approach to the individual and achieve results. Speaker Pan pointed out that the issue of moral education in middle schools is particularly important at this critical juncture of the country's survival. Students should be instilled with the principles of conduct, and he pointed out that the two words "慎獨" (shèn dú, be cautious when alone), which emphasizes self-discipline and integrity even when one is alone, should be the focus of future moral education. Chairman Fang believes that in the current moral education system, there is no clear division of responsibilities between students' parents and school moral education personnel. In the future, this should be improved to enable close cooperation between schools and parents. After the three gentlemen finished their instructions, there was a ten-minute break. Then, the schools reported on the implementation of moral education, and the meeting adjourned at 12:00 PM. Starting today, discussions on various guidance programs will begin, and the meeting is scheduled to close tomorrow afternoon.</p>

<h3>Our World Games Basketball Team Defeats Iraq by a Large Margin; Scoring a Goal Every Half Minute; Great Praise from British and French Newspapers</h3>
<p>— Special Correspondent for Our Newspaper, Zhong Zhen</p>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper, London] The Iraqi basketball team is weak in strength. Even if any university basketball team in our country comes here, it can undoubtedly win. Today (August 6th) at 10:20 AM in the Harringay Gymnasium, our country played against that team. As expected by the reporter, with 125 to 25 points, it set a new basketball record for this conference. Because our army wanted to compete for the second-class ranking in this battle, all the team members performed extremely hard. Now, the competition process is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>(Yu Ruizhang) Huang Tianxi</p>
<p>Wu Chengzhang (Jia Zhijun)</p>
<p>(Wu Chengzhang) Cai Wenhua</p>
<p>Li Shiqiao Bao Songyuan</p>
<p>At the beginning, the Chinese team still used the five fierce generals who fought yesterday. Once the ball was opened, our army used fast and skilled techniques to continuously shoot baskets, scoring 19 times. Iraq had no room to fight back. Our army's two guards, Huang Tianxi and Bao Songyuan, once they grabbed the ball, they would immediately pass it far to the forwards. In a short time, with a whistle, another goal was scored. Therefore, within ten minutes, the score soared to 30 to 6. In the next few minutes, due to the lack of strength of the team members, the Iraqi team scored several goals, making it 30 to 10. Our army quickly launched an offensive again, with agile movements, quickly scoring goals. Especially the number of balls thrown by left forward Wu Chengzhang was simply uncountable, killing the Iraqi team and leaving no one left. The result of the first half ended with 54 to 14.</p>
<h3>Thunderous Applause, Constant Cheers</h3>
<p>In the second half, the site was changed to fight again. Because the instructor Li Shiqiao's body had not yet recovered after the illness, Yu Ruizhang took charge of the left forward, while Wu Chengzhang was the right forward, and Jia Zhijun also replaced Cai Wenhua. After our country's team dispatched players, its strength was even more sufficient, and the connection was extremely tacit. The number of goals scored was still countless, from 54 to 14. It rose to 90 to 14, almost scoring a goal every half minute. It is rare to see two teams with such different strengths competing against each other. The Chinese team's passing was wonderful and clear, and the shooting was accurate. The audience in the stands on both sides gave thunderous applause and constant cheers. The small Iraqi team scored several goals, reaching 105 to 20 in the last ten minutes. At this time, our army's battle situation. All the team members who fought were covered in sweat and extremely tired. This time, the Iraqi team competed against any team in the group, all counting in the hundreds, but they never lost as many as 125 points. Therefore, the newspapers here and the Paris Daily News have successively published the Chinese team's battle situation, praising our country's basketball team's speed and shooting accuracy, calling it the crown of the countries participating this time. But the short stature and weak physical strength are the biggest shortcomings. Therefore, if our country pays attention to national physique and promotes sports in the future, there may be hope of winning a championship in the next World Games.</p>

<h3>Two Hundred Disabled War Veterans Compete in Wheelchair Sports; Unprecedented Event in Richmond Park, London</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] London, 22nd Broadcast: Two hundred British heroes who were injured in this war while defending their country recently held an unprecedented disabled automatic wheelchair competition in Richmond Park, led by British Navy Captain Dan Li. The items included (1) slow race, (2) driving skills test, (3) obstacle course, (4) egg-and-spoon race, etc. The competition was extremely fierce, and some even traveled hundreds of miles in their wheelchairs to attend.

<h3>Is China Poor?</h3>
<p>— Ze Shi</p>
<p>If I were to ask you this question, you would surely answer without thinking: "Of course it is poor!" However, after careful consideration, I cannot help but say: China is not poor!</p>
<p>One piece of evidence of this is the shortage or exorbitant demands of domestic helpers in Shanghai. Newspapers often report bankruptcies in the countryside, with villagers rushing to Shanghai to make a living, and also mention refugees from war-torn areas flocking to Shanghai. Logically, in times of oversupply of labor, these women from the countryside and refugee areas should find domestic work a viable way to make a living in Shanghai, where life is expensive and they are unfamiliar with the area. However, the reality is that although employment agencies are filled with people of all ages, families who want to hire someone for even half a year face great difficulty. Even if you offer a good wage and treat them well, it is rare to find someone. My family has not employed a domestic helper for three years and does not plan to in the future. Therefore, I am not complaining for my own sake, but after witnessing the replacement of domestic helpers in the homes of my neighbors almost twenty times in the past three months, I am compelled to say this.</p>
<p>On the other hand, while ordinary people in Shanghai find life difficult, the demand for domestic helpers is so high that those willing to do the work quit at the slightest dissatisfaction, showing no reluctance to leave and considering themselves superior to even heads of organizations. According to the law of supply and demand, this indicates that there are many people who can afford to employ domestic helpers. If everyone can afford to employ domestic helpers, how can we say that China is poor?</p>
<p>Another piece of evidence that China is not poor is the wasteful use of electricity in general stores and residences. On the one hand, people resolutely oppose price increases, while on the other hand, they do not know how to economize. This gives Western newspapers a valid reason to say: "Are you asking profit-seeking companies to lose money to supply you with two hundred electric lights burning all night while you play mahjong?" If you don't believe the wasteful use of electricity in Shanghai, conduct a survey.</p>
<p>Yet another piece of evidence that China is not poor is the donation notice from the Shanghai Municipal Finance Bureau. According to Western newspapers, someone received a notice requiring them to donate 45,000 yuan in legal tender, while the beautiful notification slip, envelope, and postage were estimated to cost 245,000 yuan, not including employee salaries and other expenses.</p>
<p>These examples may be limited to certain corners of Shanghai, but that is probably the case. However, unless the people and organizations of Shanghai are separate from the five races of China, otherwise, judging by what people say, Shanghai people consider themselves superior or are respected by people from urban and rural areas. In terms of location, Shanghai is still a place bombarded by international views, yet they are so unwilling to endure hardship and so ignorant of thrift. Even if this is not enough to represent the flaws of the entire nation, it at least casts a bad shadow over the whole country.</p>
<p>Lately, I have been constantly concerned about the fate of China, and I often make wild statements. I hope we can all learn from each other and improve.</p>
<h3>Old Beijing Sweets</h3>
<p>— Yi Yun</p>
<p>What makes Beijing memorable is its climate and way of life, which are relatively comfortable. In terms of food, not only do the restaurants in the five districts have delicious dishes, but also the various sweets sold in the markets are exquisite and unmatched elsewhere. Unfortunately, in recent years, the economy has been sluggish, and prices have risen daily, so the feeling is not as good as before. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Candied Fruits: These are divided into two categories: dry and wet. Dry candied fruits such as apples, sand pears, peaches, apricots, and pears have always been excellent products of Beijing because they are made from carefully selected fresh fruits, each piece intact, candied with sugar, and pure without residue, so they are sweet, crisp, and tender, and very delicious. Today, most are not as good as before. Only Jushenghe outside Qianmen still maintains the old flavor, but the other items in this shop are also not as good as before. Wet candied fruits such as fried hawthorn berries, candied crabapples, candied sea buckthorn, candied plums, and candied cherries each have their own skills, but are inferior to what they used to be.</p>
<p>(2) Sweet Pastries: These are the special products of the Manchu pastry shops in Beijing, such as Sachima, Furong Cake, Big and Small Eight Pieces, Oil Cake, Zilai Bai (moon cake), Fresh Flower Rose Cake, Fresh Flower Teng Luo Cake, etc. Currently, only Lao Jufeng Xiao outside Qianmen and Ruifang Jing at Dongsi Archway have acceptable products; Zhengmingzhai and Juqingzhai outside Qianmen are second; and the rest are on par with the masses. In the past, these shops used butter and honey to make various "fan mao" (white flaky pastry) products, which were very popular. Now, raw materials have become more expensive, so they have to cut corners, resulting in fewer layers of "fan mao" and less oil, making them dry and sticky, with a much weaker sweet taste than before. Some shops even mix in wheat flour, which is even more tasteless.</p>
<p>(3) Other: Such as sugar goods (including sugar dumplings, candied winter melon strips, candied water chestnuts, candied lotus root, candied taro, tangerine peel, etc.), except for sugar dumplings, which are still acceptable, most of the rest are hard and not sweet, and none can compare to what they used to be. As for the sugar category (including various fruit candies, fudge, etc.), the stalls in the Dong'an Market sell better ones, but they are much inferior to what they used to be, and the rest are even worse. As for southern-style pastries, shops such as Daoxiangcun and Guixiangcun used to promote Suzhou, Shanghai, and Jiaxing-Huzhou delicacies, and their business was quite good, but their products were not as good as those in Suzhou and Shanghai. Recently, they have been declining, but the sweetness is slightly stronger than in the northern shops.</p>
<p>(4) Street stalls and street vendors: Such as millet tea, sliced cake, sugar peas, pea flour cake, barley porridge, fried rice cake, fried cake, bean curd cake, etc., although they are still readily available, they are all greatly inferior due to the principle of cutting corners.</p>
<p>(5) Cold Items: Beijing's sour plum soup was originally very famous, but the ones sold now are too little sweet. As for the other items, they are even less worth mentioning.</p>
<p>In short, life in Beijing is becoming increasingly difficult, and people have to practice thrift. The above-mentioned sweets are somewhat extravagant, and with the current shortage of materials, the number of people who can afford to buy them at high prices is decreasing daily. In order to maintain their business, the shops have to lower their prices to attract customers, and the products are also becoming increasingly inferior. In addition, the price of sugar is extremely high, and wages are rising daily. If you want to get the old flavor, you can only order custom-made items from them at a high price, and you may still get good products.</p>
<h3>Roosevelt's Misstep</h3>
<p>— Jin Yu</p>
<p>The most important thing in wartime is to accurately assess the enemy's situation. If the commander makes mistakes in this area for various reasons, the tragic consequences are inevitable.</p>
<p>However, even President Roosevelt, who was so intelligent, made a very serious miscalculation in World War II, resulting in heavy losses—he did not expect that an old "hero" in his eighties would willingly recognize a thief as his father!</p>
<p>When Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov visited the United States and Britain one after another, the then Chief of Staff of the United States Army, General Marshall, immediately reported to Roosevelt: The Second Front in Europe could definitely be opened in 1942. Roosevelt gladly told this promise to Molotov, and Molotov gladly returned to the Soviet Union. The friendship between the United States and the Soviet Union reached its peak.</p>
<p>However, in 1942, after Marshall, Roosevelt's special envoy Hopkins, and US Admiral King went to Britain together for a staff meeting, all the plans were overturned. The British command believed that opening the Second Front in Europe at this time would inevitably result in a disastrous defeat, and they strongly advocated landing in North Africa.</p>
<p>Stalin was naturally very unhappy about this, but Roosevelt, after much consideration, accepted the British opinion.</p>
<p>The starting date of the North African landing was November 8 of the following year. When all the preparations were almost complete, Roosevelt wrote many letters to the heads of state of various countries with colonies in North Africa, stating the motives for the landing.</p>
<p>Among these letters, one was addressed to the French General Pétain. Roosevelt's wording was extremely tactful, beginning by calling Pétain "old friend," and continuing with phrases such as "We were comrades in arms in 1918, and defeating Germany, the old enemy of France, is also our common desire today..." At the same time, Roosevelt repeatedly asked Churchill that the North African landing should be entirely the responsibility of the US military, because the friendship between the United States and France was long-standing, the success of the American Revolution relied on French assistance, and the United States also rescued France in World War I, so the French garrison in North Africa would definitely not resist during the landing, and the overall situation could be settled without bloodshed.</p>
<p>Roosevelt's intention was profound. On the one hand, he was indeed convinced that the French garrison in North Africa would not resist, but on the other hand, he had another trick—at that time, the ambitious De Gaulle was under the full support of the British army, but Roosevelt had always disliked De Gaulle's boastful and arrogant empty facade, and he was determined not to let De Gaulle have the opportunity to stand out.</p>
<p>After Churchill read Roosevelt's letter to Pétain, he said, "It's written too politely!" Roosevelt thought for a moment and deleted all the words such as "old friend."</p>
<p>Pétain's reply came, but it was a letter as sharp as a blade! Not a word was mentioned about American-French friendship. Instead, it said coldly, "You have insulted France. Since you have ordered the attack, I have ordered self-defense!"</p>
<p>As a result, there was a major battle for three days and nights, and the casualties on both the American and French sides were very heavy. The "hero of the Battle of Verdun" in Roosevelt's mind turned out to be a traitor! The United States fought an unnecessary battle, and the Second Front was delayed by two years before it was opened, only to give Germany the opportunity to prepare calmly. (Excerpted from Hopkins' Secret Memoirs)</p>
<h3>Talking About Regret</h3>
<p>— Ji Mu</p>
<p>I don't regret things afterwards when I make mistakes in handling things. For example, if I plan to invest in a certain security, and I accidentally make a mistake and fail to buy it, but the price rises a few days later, even many times the original price, I don't feel any remorse. Instead, I am willing to think calmly, analyze the causes and consequences of success or failure, and if there are mistakes, I will find ways to improve them to avoid repeating them in the future. On the contrary, regretting it afterwards only brings self-inflicted troubles and hinders sound thinking.</p>
<p>Before, I used to make the mistake of hesitating when dealing with things. Indeed, there are many things in society that make people feel difficult. Confucius said, "Think thrice before acting," which also means that we should be careful when dealing with things. But once you have "thought thrice," you must "act." According to a certain businessman, even if you "act" wrongly, you can still find ways to remedy it, which is better than sitting and doing nothing.</p>
<p>Originally, not knowing regret is often regarded as not knowing remorse. What I am saying here about not regretting refers to not making emotional and unnecessary annoyance, but making a calm review from a rational point of view. The meaning is quite different.</p>
<h3>Double Lotus</h3>
<p>— Zhu Ying</p>
<p>A double lotus stem can bloom four flowers, or three flowers, and at least two flowers. The petals are numerous and red, and the outer petals gradually become larger and lighter in color. The flowers are as large as peonies, so they are also called peony lotuses. It is said that the flower species comes from India, so it is extremely rare. The flowers do not bear fruit, and they dry up on the branches at the end of autumn. The underground rhizomes are no different from ordinary lotus flowers, so it is said that there are double lotus flowers, but no double lotus roots. In my hometown of Nanyang Lake, one or two flowers can be seen blooming on the lake. People often regard them as auspicious omens, because they will not bloom the following year. It is said that when the flower is in bud, if you touch it with your finger, it will not grow again, and it is called the fairy product among flowers.</p>
<h3>Chen Xiaoshi</h3>
<p>— Qian Dacheng</p>
<p>Reading the Shen Bao of the 19th of this month, I learned that Chen Xiaoshi, the Governor-General of Kuizhou, died of illness in Shanghai on the 18th. Xiaoshi was smart and long-lived, but in his later years, he was not very aware of world affairs. He usually did not go downstairs, but played mahjong with relatives and friends day and night. He also did not know the crazy rise in prices. He only played mahjong for ten yuan per bottom, and he was very pleased with himself when he won a few yuan each time. His gambling friends and the ten-yuan and five-yuan banknotes were all collected by his family, in order to comfort his loneliness in his later years.</p>
<p>Xiaoshi's second wife, Madam Xu Zhongyi, whose name was Xishen, died early. She was able to write poetry, and she had a "Tingqiuguan Poetry Collection." Xiaoshi wrote a preface for it and published it in the world. The preface said: "I often stayed behind to guard the place, and whenever there were matters to discuss, she would understand the key points. After the matter was settled, whenever there was leisure time, we would pick tea, brew tea, and compose poems together for pleasure..." So Zhongyi was also a talented woman of her time. In Zhongyi's collection, there is a poem in response to Xiaoshi's farewell poem to Suzhou, which contains the line "The qin and crane on one shoulder are familiar with the road home, the mist-covered snails are stacked with the sorrows of a traveler." Her style is also very good.</p>
<h3>Sitting at Night</h3>
<p>— You Moruo</p>
<p>The streetlights are like beans, and the pen is quiet. I am still here, wearing a short coat. What can I say about this world? I have sharpened my sword for ten years, and my heart is invincible. But one night, I was surprised to find frost on my temples. The sound of crickets cannot stop entering my ears, urging the news of autumn to the neighboring garden!</p>
<h3>Evening Sitting in Hongkou Park</h3>
<p>— Chen Zhongtao</p>
<p>After the rain, the afterglow of the sunset is beautiful in the distant sandbar, and the water lilies sway gently, sending out soft sounds. The light of the water invades the dark, whiter than snow, and the shadows of the lamps are separated by the forest, as dense as stars. The quiet environment makes me forget worldly affairs, and the autumn wind has already arrived at the park. I sit and meditate on finding poetry, and my lonely heart enters the dark and mysterious realm.</p>
<p>###</p>
<p>Reading the newly published "China Provincial Maps" (the fourth edition was published before the war, and this is the fifth edition) in Shen Bao, I was filled with mixed emotions when I reached the page of Fujian and Taiwan. After the war, the map changes color, which is a common occurrence in history. However, we feel that the significance of Taiwan is even more profound, not just because of the Sino-Japanese War of 1894-95, but also because it dates back to the late Ming Dynasty.</p>
<p>During the Ming Dynasty, the Dutch occupied Taiwan, and Zheng Chenggong drove them away, marking the first page of our Asian Han people's glorious war history against foreign powers. After occupying Taiwan, Mr. Zheng used it as a base, and even after the Ming Dynasty was destroyed and the Qing Dynasty's power spread throughout the country, he was still able to respect the Ming Dynasty's calendar and resist the Qing Dynasty for many years. Even in the early years of the Kangxi Emperor's reign, after the death of the Shunzhi Emperor, there was nothing they could do. Unfortunately, a traitor who sold his country and his master appeared in Zheng's army, Shi Lang (the father of "Lord Shi" in the Shi Gong An novels and dramas). He was originally a general of the Ming Dynasty, and was still in awe when Zheng Chenggong was alive. Later, after the main general died of illness, the young master (Zheng Jing) had a slight disagreement with him, and he actually secretly fled across the sea, surrendered to the Qing Dynasty, and "presented the map," revealing all the secrets. He also led the attack and sent Taiwan to the Qing Dynasty. Shi, the traitor, was granted the title of Qing Marquis and earned a bad name for thousands of generations.</p>
<p>Two hundred years after Taiwan belonged to the Qing Dynasty, the Qing Dynasty ceded it to Japan. After fifty years, it was returned to China. Summarizing the history and making a historical evaluation, its glory for the nation has three major stages: (1) Against Europe (Zheng drove away the Dutch); (2) Against the Qing (the Zheng family occupied this corner to resist, like a golden city guarding the sea and a bronze pillar touching the sky); (3) Against Japan (washing away the shame of the years 1874 and 1894-95).</p>
<p>The cession of Taiwan was due to the Sino-Japanese War of 1894-95, but the Japanese harassment and attempt to seize Taiwan dated back to 1874, twenty years before the war. At that time, it was the thirteenth year of the Qing Tongzhi Emperor (1874). Some Ryukyuans were killed in Taiwan by aborigines, which had nothing to do with Japan. However, the Japanese Saigo Takamori led warships to Taiwan and arbitrarily searched and killed people. The Qing court sent Shen Baozhen to suppress them and paid 500,000 in compensation to settle the matter, thinking it was a small matter that did not cost much, and did not care much. However, Saigo reported to his country and greatly praised his achievements, because the Qing court had tacitly acknowledged that Ryukyu belonged to Japan because the Ryukyuans were harmed and compensation was paid to Japan. The Qing court was indeed careless, and the Japanese were truly cunning.</p>
<p>In the next five years, the Japanese secretly invaded Ryukyu. In the fifth year of Guangxu, they openly announced the abolition of its king and changed it to Okinawa Prefecture. The Qing court suddenly woke up from a dream and quickly raised protests and sent personnel for negotiations. The Japanese spoke plausibly, delaying the decision. By the Sino-Japanese War of 1894-95, they even stirred up trouble in Korea and Liaodong, and forcibly demanded Taiwan after the war. At that time, Li Hongzhang even asked: "The war between the two countries is in the Northeast, what does it have to do with Taiwan?" But the Japanese were triumphant and would not allow any explanation. Who would have thought that although 1874 and 1894-95 were twenty years apart, it was just a series of tricks for them!</p>
<p>In August of the 34th year of the Republic of China (1945), the Japanese announced their acceptance of the Potsdam Declaration, withdrew from all the places they had invaded, and turned those old tricks into a dream!</p>
