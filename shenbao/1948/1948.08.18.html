<h3>「七五」事件調查竣事政院決審愼處理　秦德純昨謁翁文灝覆命</h3>

<p>〔本報瀋陽十七日電〕翁院長十六日電東北剿總，略稱：「七五」事件眞象，據秦次長德純調査報吿，大部責任業已判明，處理辦法近日即決定，希靜候中樞解決。</p>
<h3>監委報告脫稿　信可公正解決</h3>
<p>〔中央社北平十七日電〕監委谷鳳翔，胡文暉兩氏，十七日就「七五」事件調査工作發表餮面談話稱：七五事件發生，迄今歷時月餘，中央對此不幸事件異常重覦，故於月初派國防部秦次長德純蒞平調査，監察院亦因大會決議派鳳翔，文暉來平，以監察院嚴正之立塲及法律觀點，調査本案眞象及地方負責官吏是否有處置失當與遠法失職情事，以便依法處理，經十餘日調查結果，由於地方公正紳士在塲之中外記者及中外人士所提貢之資料曁有關機關報吿文卷，以客觀冷靜之態度，從事分析硏究，并已到現塲數次勘察及詢問有關人員，已獲得眞相，除於目前將本案要點及處理意見電報監院核辦外，詳細報吿書亦已脫稿，日內即可返京覆命，相信本案於最近必可獲得公正之解決。</p>

<p>〔本市訊〕經濟合作總署中國分署稱，由於經濟合作總署及美援運用委員會之迅速實行援助，瀋陽糧食情形正改善中。據瀋陽美國總領事華德謂，　麥種子廿五噸，已在瀋陽曾遭蟲害之高梁田中播種。預料此廿五噸稱子至少能生產榖類四百五十噸。另有七十五噸喬麥種子刻正在北平採購中，以備空運瀋陽。</p>

<h3>由公用事業漲價核減說明　——誠懇呼籲中央重視此一問題——</h3>
<p>上海市八大公用事業公司八月份的漲價問題，前幾天鬧得滿城風雨，似乎將有更大的意外事件可能發生一般。各公司八月份的新價一增三四倍，有的幾達戰前的一千萬倍，遂使一般市民無不感到生活的威脅，，不但在心理上覺得受不了，而在實際上大多數人也確乎付不起；因此在民間乃有拒繳運動的醞釀。幸而代表上海五百萬人民的市參議會，不論替市民的生活打算，或爲社會秩序着想，覺得這個問題無論如何應該覓獲一個比較合理的解决方案，乃於十五日召開臨時大會，當卽决定核减新價三項辦法；又幸而吳市長於執行該案之際，前昨兩天，不惜脣焦舌敝，會同市參議會議長副議長及公用委員會召集人各參議員，竭力向各公司當局勸導，各公司代表初雖堅不接受减價，終於爲市長議長等所感動，在市政府與參議會共同負責向中央銀行商請借墊八月份减收之差額以後，爲顧全維持市民生活及社會秩序計，毅然接受减價。這件可能醞成意外風波的大事，幸免陷於僵局。</p>
<p>對這件事，我們萬分欽佩市長的忍耐功夫，同時我們也確實認識了市參議會這個機關盡了市民代表的責任，而又能有不偏不倚的决議。</p>
<p>市長和公用局趙局長在此事發生之初，備受外界過分的責難，而始終能忍辱負重的去幹，盡力於斡旋，非深得忍辱三昧者，决難有此耐性。天下事，有許多原非經過千回百折，千錘百鍊，不能成功；故徒逞一時意氣者，决不足以語此。而市長於六月初已料及公用事業將有逈非市民所能負祖之調整價格，堅電中央請辭；惟因不獲核准，乃更致力於解决。可見市長决非只顧公司一面而置市民負担於腦後者，市參議會則早在三月與六月兩次大會中，爲了公用事業價格的如何穩定，迭向中央有所陳述和呼籲，且在事實上歷經會同市政當局，商洽貸款及結購外滙預購燃料等事，尤足證明他們參議員並不一味只替市民减少負祖，而抹煞各公司業務經營的困難。好了，現在總算各公司已經懸崖勒馬，接受了市參議會的决議與市長的具體實施辦法。星星之火，庶幾不致燎原，我們在這裏先爲上海慶幸，也更爲全國慶幸！</p>
<p>然而，問題並沒有完全解决，還更有待於中央和地方當局與全體市民的充分認識與權衡輕重的果斷行動。</p>
<p>我們首須指出：公用事業之漲價過高問題，其原因在公用事業本身少，而在外滙牌價不斷提高，一般物價急劇上漲，幣値日趨跌落之情形下，一般經濟嚴重問題中之一環。在公用事業者，似乎不夠他們的開支，而在一般工商業和市民，卻實在已威到無力負担，尤其大多數恃薪工爲生活的人們，故補救公用事業困難之責任，不能完全責望之於地方當局。而且，公用事業譬如人身事業價格的暴漲，勢必影響及於一般物價，而一般物價暴漲之結果，最受害者無過於國庫。故中央負責穩定公用事業之價格，乃天經地義責無旁貸之事。</p>
<p>其次，必須指出所以造成這種糾紛，幾乎釀成軒然大波者，由於計算價格時在規定公式中於七月份指數之外另加百分之五十，姑無論公之是否合理，而旣云公式矣，何又隨便更動增加？反之，則市民何不可以要求更動减低？在公司原為要求預付若干，市府爲遷就事實計，乃有此建議，而工商部則在事後又爲毫不加以考慮之備案，甚且以此惡例，普遍推行於各地。大權在握，絕未顧到人民負担能力如何，實爲最可遺慷之事。現在百分之五十旣經取消，新價自可核减，各公司八月份果眞頭寸短缺，不敷周轉，中央爲權宜應付計，爲弭患於無形計，對於市政府市參議會之折衷方案與緊急呼籲，確應予以十分同情之考慮，以借墊方法，渡此八月份之難關。至若九月份起之價格，尤盼本市公用事業公開調査審議委會今天下午成立以後，積極展開工作，至下月初，卽有更爲合理之規定：同時亦深望市民共體時艱，信任此一審議機構，必能於雙方兼顧之下，爲市民日常所需水，電，交通等供應盡其籌劃之能事。一切威情激越的言論與行動，在此時都宜避免，靜候審議會之公正處理，而弗爲別有用心者所乘機鼓煽。</p>
<p>最後，我們特別要請中央重視上海這一個問題！因爲此一問題如不能獲得公平合理之解决，迫使人民不能負祖，則可能引起水電斷缺，工商停滯，失業頓增，社會騷動。試問上海如果到了這步境界，豈是中央所期望？戡亂以安定爲先；經濟以生產爲重。上海一市，關繫全國大局者，决非普通一城一邑可比；如何求其社會安定，如何求其生產不停，必須由政府與人民協力維持公用事業做起，而各公用事業公司尤應整理業務，善盡其責任！</p>

<h3>匪諜製造學潮鐵證（上）</h3>
<p>〔中央社南京十七日電〕頃由有關機關發表共匪間諜煽惑純潔學生，製造學潮之鐵證一文，原文如下：</p>
<p>一，共匪青運組織及其國際背景</p>
<p>共匪欺騙靑年之靑運工作，係由共匪「中央靑年部」直接規劃領導，而以僞民盟總部「靑年工作委員會」爲其外圍領導中心。其核心組織，爲「民主靑年聯盟」。中國「民主靑年聯盟」係共產國際赤色靑年組織「世界民主靑年聯盟」構成單位之一，其總部設於哈爾濱。近爲便於直接統治匪區靑年，在匪區內之「民主靑年聯盟」組織，則改稱爲「毛澤東靑年團」而利用潛伏政府區內各地之匪諜學生，成立各種全國性的學生組織，以構成其新的全國性靑年外圍組織，直接接受共匪「中央靑年部」之策動與指</p>
<p>至於匪諜學生在匪黨命令下，所進行組織的全國性學生組織，當以利用所謂「一二·一」事件，組成「昆明學生聯合會」，爲其利用學生校際組織，製造學潮擴大影響的開端。故緊接着三十五年春天，上海各校潛伏匪諜與民盟外圍學生團體，便合組「上海學生團體聯合會」（簡稱學團聯），參加是年六月二十三日之「上海人民團體聯合晋京請願運動。」此一「學團聯」組織，即爲以後共匪全國學生聯合組織之發展基礎。三十六年一月，共匪利用北平沈崇案件，發動全國學生反美運動，相繼在全國各地，組織「某某市學生抗議美國暴行聯合會」的校際組織。其中以上海，重慶，北平，昆明等地活動最力。同年三月八日在共匪「中央靑年部」的直接授意下，匪諜學生爲配合莫斯科外長會議之召開，積極策動輿聯繫各區域「抗暴聯」，在上海秘密成立所謂「全國學生抗暴聯合會」，此一組織，實爲共匪在政府區利用潛伏之匪諜學生，公然進行全國性學生組織的濫觴。其後層出不窮的學潮，當以此爲大規模的策動中心。</p>
<p>「全國抗暴聯」成立後，其中心工作，即爲全力爭取各地主要專科以上學校學生自治會之領導權，並積極進行佈置發動所謂「反饑餓」，「反內戰」，「搶救敎育危機」種種五月學潮準備工作。是年五月廿日，京，滬，蘇，杭，汴五區職業學生，策動推選所謂學生代表，在京遊行請願，正式導演所謂「五大」事件，同時匪諜學生，並肆渲染陰謀，發動於六月二日全國「總罷」，以測騐其在全國學生陣營中的支配力量。幸賴咯地治安當局事先多方防範疏導，與大多數善良學生的深明大義，此一陰謀策動，未能獲逞。但匪諜學生却得乘此機會，於六月中旬，在滬召開「全國學生代表大會」，由各地匪諜學生推派代表參加。會中決定將原有之「全國抗暴聯」改組爲僞「中國學生聯合會」（簡稱中國學聯），以爲其長期想動學潮誘致靑年學生參加匪區叛亂工作之總機關。原有之各區「抗暴聯」，亦同時改組為各區域偽「學聯」。其組織系統，可表解如下：世界民主靑年聯盟，赤色國際學聯，僞中國學聯「理事會」之下爲—上海學聯「理事」兼秘書處—南京學聯「理事」—華北學聯「理事」—浙江學聯「理事」—江蘇學聯「理事」—武漢學聯「理事」—昆明學聯「理事」—河南學聯—西北學聯（卅七年春着手籌備）—香港辦事處（與共匪及國際共產黨聯絡，傳達命令及領導南洋華僑學生團體）其下爲大學聯，中學聯，（共匪職業學生控制之各校學生自洽會，共匪職業學生之各種社團）。</p>
<p>僞「中國學聯」成立後，除直接接受「中央靑年部」命令，配合共匪武裝叛亂，進行瓦解政府後方之種種陰謀活動外，並與共產國際所用以煽動各國靑年背叛其祖國之赤色「國際學聯」學生，密切聯繋，成為該一國際陰謀組織單位之一。本月二日，偽「中國」學聯」與「民主靑年聯盟」及民盟「靑年工作委員會」擅以「中國靑年代表團」名義，派遣代表赴印參加「世界民主靑年聯盟成立大會」，與「國際學聯」所召開之「東南亞民主靑年大會」，會後由僞「學聯」派錢存蘇駐捷京任「國際學聯」中國籍副主席兼所謂「殖民地半殖民地部部長」。按「世界民主靑年聯盟」與「國際學聯」　組織，不但爲共產國際進行組織各國共黨靑年之外圍組織，並爲「某國靑年反法西斯委員會」所直接領導，僞「中國學聯」，不惜公開派遣代表參加，並公開接受其領導，足證匪諜學生，出賣祖國，助匪爲虐，並進行赤化全中國靑年之陰謀，昭然若揭。更證之於本年五月所謂「國際學聯」秘書布列克曼，，經由東南亞各地及香港，公然來我國視察平，滬，杭，京一帶僞「中國學聯」所進行之學運概况，備受各地職業學生熱烈歡迎，與「國際學聯」公然聲稱將於本年八月召開大會，討論「如何加强中國學運工作」，便十足證明匪諜學生與共匪及共產靑年國際的三位一體，沆瀣一氣了。（未完）</p>

<h3>史達林與狄托的鬥爭（上）</h3>
<p>— 本報編譯室譯　（原文載七月九日「美國新聞與世界報告」雜誌）</p>
<p>狄托對克林姆宮的違抗，把蘇聯體系的眞正弱點暴露了出來。世人以爲莫斯科統治着一個「聯合帝國」的見解是被打破了。蘇聯和南斯拉夫的摩擦是表面的，顯而易見的；蘇聯和其他衛星國的摩擦是隱伏的，隨時可能表面化的。共產主義國家需要的美元與物資，蘇聯不能供給。這對於蘇系國家的團結或許是一個不堪忍受的打擊。</p>
<p>（一）東歐集團的鬆馳</p>
<p>新生的共產帝國開始顯露了裂痕。受影響的是位於共產帝國西南邊的南斯拉夫，原來莫斯科的共產領袖和貝爾格勒的共產領袖之間發生了爭執。　在蘇聯國境以外的共產國家元首敢和克林姆宮違抗的，當以南斯拉夫的狄托元首爲嚆矢。他逐漸和克林姆宮宣吿脫輻，因爲在八個共產主義國家中，除了阿爾巴尼亞以外，祗有他的國家旣非與蘇聯接壤，也沒有蘇聯軍隊佔領。</p>
<p>狄托在第二次世界大戰時憑了自己的奮鬥而發跡，並且始終緊密地統御着南斯拉夫的陸軍，秘密警察，和共產黨機關。其他的東歐共產主義國家都是由莫斯科御定的人們領導着，大都靠了蘇聯陸軍的帮助而得勢的。他們至今還聽從莫斯科的指示，定像法國和義大利的共產黨一樣。可是若干國家已逐漸頑强起來了</p>
<p>南斯拉夫國內所發生的事情，不但在新生的共產帝國的領域裏關係重大，即對於美國和其他西方國家亦至關緊要，一般人以爲受蘇聯控制的東歐國家集團是緊密團結的這稱見解，已經被打破了，而另外生成一種見解，認爲其他隱伏的弱　，如果加上西方的壓力和美元，可能把這個集團再度分裂開開。</p>
<p>東歐全境鬧着经济恐慌，這使蘇聯的衛星國家想到和西方國家妥協。工業化計劃遲遲推進，蘇聯亟岡自己建設，沒有餘力供給多量的機器。這種機器可以從西方取得，可是東歐國家不能大量輸出，以購買這些機器。</p>
<p>被擯棄於馬歇爾計劃以外的共產國家，莫不需要美元孔亟。爲了解放美國所沒收的値價五千萬美元的南斯拉夫黃金，狄托元帥被迫接受美方對南國所提出的要求。其他東歐國家爲了貿易和借款的需要，也許不久都要對美讓步。</p>
<p>東歐內部的反抗，漸漸使蘇聯盟國的一冷戰」軟化下去。南國總理狄托不顧蘇聯的壓力，不願强迫南國農民立即實行集體農場制，便是一個例證。狄托深恐農民的消極抵抗，足以危及糧食的供應。在其他東歐國家，小工業和零售業的國營計劃，也因同樣理由而被擱置下來。</p>
<p>共產政府是滑有被推翻的危險的，因爲警察·軍隊·工會和政府機關都在它的掌握中。但是各處的共產黨負仍只佔着少數。如果眼西方國家開火，衛星國的軍隊沒有多大的價值。東歐各國政府對莫斯科卑躬屈滕，但不能贏得民心。反之，狄托對莫斯科反抗，在國內聲望日隆。在具有長久的反蘇歷史的波蘭·匈牙利和羅馬尼亞等國，在地下反抗莫斯科的情緒尤爲強烈。</p>

<h3>真如附近砲聲隆隆　軍械分庫爆炸　燬屋傷亡八人　搬運不慎手溜彈墮地肇禍</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕本市眞如附近聯勤總部第五軍械庫第一分庫，昨因搬運彈藥不愼，引起爆炸，自上午九時五十分起至下午四時止，共傷亡八人，燬房屋十餘間，幸地處荒僻，損失尙微。當局除加强警戒並進行淸理外，並已着手調査詳細眞相。</p>
<p>該庫位於交通路北沈家角泉智里，距眞如約六七里。庫內有一汽車間，原堆置卅餘噸前日軍遺留之彈藥廢品，包括炮彈，重擲溜彈，手溜彈等甚多。最近因該庫需修繕整理，十六日起即由上尉庫員歐腸森率同班長陳鵬，庫兵伍長淸，李席迪，傅賢共五人，將彈藥移運出外。昨渠等仍繼續工作，在上午九時五十分左右，突因搬運不愼，遺一手溜彈墮地，該批彈藥藏置過久，危險性極大，故當塲立吿爆炸，火星濺射，延及其他砲彈，轟然一聲，遂釀巨禍，歐陽等五人未及奔避，俱吿殉職。當時彈片四飛，勢極兇猛，在庫房週圍之庫警隊第五班衛兵張國志，保安連某士兵，及附近居民趙三毛等三人，亦遭擊傷，惟傷勢尙輕。</p>
<p>官長勘察加強警戒</p>
<p>出事時，該分庫庫長熊寶宗，適赴江　總庫謁庫長徐文達，聞訊後立即趕回，各區消防隊亦趕到奮勇灌救，但因彈片亂飛，施救困難，直至下午四時，始克將餘燼撲滅。在爆炸時，聯勤上海供應局局長陳謙，副局長石振聲，港口司令部周司令，警備部第二大隊長嚴滋等均到場勘察，並加強警戒，真如區警局人員亦全部出動。</p>
<p>殃及鄉民全家蕩然</p>
<p>據事後損失調查：除該庫汽車間全燬外，五十二號營房亦遭殃及，大部塌圯，附近民房被焚毀及震坍者，有孫阿富等家共五間，此外尙有一居民孫桂根，因其子即將於十月間完姻，故家中新購大批傢俱，豬羊等甚多，此次首當其衝，全家蕩然，損失最大。至炸燬之彈藥，據目前約略估計，有手溜彈二萬餘，照明彈二萬餘，砲彈約九十發。據當局事後表示：對此次爆炸事件，除當依法追究責任外，並將加强其他各軍械庫之檢査及警戒，以策安全。傷亡兵民應設法撫卹賠償，同時因氣候炎熱，爲防爆炸地點仍有危險，故將一面消防，一面警戒，淸理工作須俟二三日後方能進行。</p>
<p>發現兩人不無嫌疑</p>
<p>中央社訊：據自負責調查出事原因方面獲悉：當該庫爆炸之前，有一寄住該庫之失業軍人，突然離去，似不無嫌疑，正進行偵査中。</p>
<p>又訊：當爆炸發生前一日（十六日）中午十一時，在該分庫五百公尺警戒綫內，曾發現靑年一名，徘徊爲時極久，似有所企圖，當爲該庫警衛兵所獲，據供名李春祥，十七歲，蘇北鹽城人，住眞茹浜北小新莊（朱家灣西首），但未吐露徘徊原因，嫌疑成份至爲重大。</p>

<h3>參會市府負責請貸款　公用事業允核減新價　公共汽車及輪渡今起即行減價</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕本市公用事業减價問題，昨已獲圓滿解決。各公用事業決依照此次市參議會決　辦法，核减本月份新價，惟因减價而虧損部份，由市政府及參議會負責向中央銀行請求貸款。核减後新價於抄表日起實施，已付當退還。</p>
<p>市公用局經辦之公共汽車及市輪渡價格，今日起即行核减，新價爲：市公共汽車，十萬元至廿八萬元（原價十四萬至卅五萬元）。市輪渡，對江渡，十萬元（原價十二萬元）。畏渡，六萬八千元（原價八萬五千元）。月季票，按照月季票辦法第九條規定，票價並無變更。</p>

<p>又公用事業公開制査審議委員會，定今日起成立，先行討論審議程序。除市參會已推定姜豪，李文杰，瞿鉞，江浩然，邵永生等五人爲委員外，市商會，總工會，市工業會，工程師學會，電機工程師學會，會計師公會，市政府，社會局，公用局等單位，各推派代表一人担任委員。</p>

<h3>生動的髟皇島</h3>
<p>— 本報特派員　韓清濤</p>
<p>〔本報秦皇島十四日航訊〕KMA建設了秦皇島的碼頭，所以秦皇島海濱成了KMA的天下，KMA是開　礦務局的英文縮寫，同時也是他們的標識。</p>
<p>走到秦皇島鐵道南海濱區，有直通碼頭的「開灤路」，坦平的水泥路旁，長着潔綠的高槐，矮楡，另有印着KMA的紅色缸磚路，依傍，並行。</p>
<p>東面是開灤鐵道，鐵道上走着多數標着KMA的火車頭，又有KMA字的電車和大小汽車，分別在鐵道和馬路上跑，在這裏也可到多數戴着KMA帽徽的開灤員工，活動着，工作着。</p>
<p>走到東山上，何東北展望，有一洱廣大面積的貯煤廠，可以貯存煤斤五六十萬噸，古冶和唐山的煤，送到這裏來，然後分別運到南方和國外去。</p>
<p>開灤的天下　東山北脚下，有開灤水電廠，供給開灤碼頭，工廠，辦公處，以及全鐵道南開灤和耀華員工住宅的光和用水，每道街和衝要空地，都有任憑住戶開閉取用的水龍頭。　水電廠以北地區，開灤鐵道縱橫，機車，貨車，電車，都停放在這裏，開灤的修理工廠，也在那個漆着KMA黃色大字，圈起了圍牆的區域裏，冒着烟汽，響着捶鑿聲。</p>
<p>水陸聯絡站　秦皇島碼關，在東山南脚下，計有大小兩個，像人的兩條腿伸進海面，大碼頭在外面，是一個半圈形鋼骨水泥的長堤，這個長弓似的碼頭，弓背做爲防波堤，弓弦的裏面，是輪船停泊區域，小碼頭在大碼頭右側，在港灣裏面，是一個短堤。</p>
<p>大小碼頭，合計長約二千七百呎，港口的深度從廿一呎到卅一呎，吃水深度在三十呎以內的船隻，都可停泊，大碼頭可以停船五艘，小碼頭停船兩艘，碼頭上舖有鐵軌，火車來往，裝卸貨物，從海上船來的貨物，由開灤機車送到北寗路道口，拖上北寗路，火車來貨，在道口由開灤車拉至碼頭，水陸聯絡，至爲便捷。</p>
<p>碼頭上，設有自來水管，供給停泊船隻甜水，附近還有一個可容一萬五千噸的貨棧，港灣有兩隻挖泥船，冒着烟，響着馬達，經常疏濬港灣。</p>
<p>這裏的氣溫，在冬天雖然常在零度以下，一二月內海面還要結冰，但對輪船航行和停泊，無大阻礙，冰凍很了，破冰船可以掃除嚴寒所予的障礙，所以秦皇島成了北方的不凍港。</p>
<p>今天，奏皇島成了南北水陸聯繫點，華北水上補給綫，東北支援站，海軍北上南進的基地，都由這個開灤私有的碼頭，發揮着爲公家爲本身偉大的力量。</p>
<p>南北兩區域　一條北寧路，把秦皇島劃成鐵道南北兩個區域，鐵道北是舊的市面，西前街，西後街，海陽路，和兩條南北的橫馬路，爲各類商店集中區，同時這兩條橫馬路，也是貫穿和溝通鐵道南北兩區的幹綫。</p>
<p>大小商店經售的各貨，都來自天津，幾家書店除了文具和小學敎科書外，就是大津所出的五六種電影戲劇畫報，其他京滬刋物，一本也沒有。大小三家電影院，演着平津演過很久的影片。</p>
<p>「開灤」·「耀華」·「北寗路」。「冀電分公司」等，繁榮了秦皇島，所有的人大半是直接或　接在這兩個招牌下求生的，除了少數特殊人物外，也可說是互相依賴着生存在這塊土地上。</p>
<p>幽美的東山，別有洞天，淸新的海濱，風光美好，日西斜，看海潮的男女，洗海浴的小夥子，活躍在沙灘上的小寳寳，以及爲了納涼來的老公公，大自然都給了他們相當的滿足。</p>

<h3>銀根回鬆人心堅挺　華股臨收突轉疾升　永紗勤興等十一種均漲達限度</h3>
<p>華股昨雖漲而高價迄難持久，銀根業已稍稍鬆動，惟停止工商界借貸，及緊縮發行等措　，雖離事實尚遠，但脆弱之股市，不無戒心。臨收時業外之刺激更强，復謠傳國行大差出，勤興等十一種漲達限度，永紗復略需貼價，半中環境造成。半受隔日交割所慫恿，尙難肯定。</p>
<p>晨初即堅，永紗開高至一六六〇〇元，餘亦全帶好，開後逢高有一四八號二〇六號七六號一二號二〇七號三〇號八九號一三七號二一八號了結不已，逐步下游，午刻曾低至一五九五〇元，經六九號一九〇號二〇六號等補漲，午收為一六〇五〇元。較前收永永業漲停板，中法國貨內衣平平，新光景福新華麗安小挫，永公中泥絲益升半成，閘北信誼中絲低半成外，餘均小升。</p>
<p>後市永紗上場即見一六七〇〇元，仍屬虛象，自一六七二〇元起，一一四號二一八號一三七號一六〇號脫手，代至一六五八〇元，勤興因掉換股票，更改單位關係，哄達漲停板，餘股直至三時後，始由靜止轉俏利，榮豐內衣華豐景綸永公商務閘北恒豐中興次第漲停，永紗由一九〇號六五號一四五一五五號等吸收，漲停後略有加水。業外刺激增强，復謠傳國行大差出也，但國行實屬差進，收後永紗漲停限度有賣戶，較晨收計永紗勤興榮豐內衣永公華豐商務閘北興恒豐漲停，餘股成昂半成至一成。場外各未上市股票均俏，尤以世界中國大生冠生園為最激昇。</p>
<p>公債　昨以銀根轉鬆，再向新高峯挺進，新買咸且熱望，統丙晨開即昂升為二一萬，並漲二三八萬新高峯，近午在二三〇萬問掙扎，五五二室五〇三室三六〇室三五〇室雖來賣出，則仍以二二八萬收市，結果較前收計甲乙丙戊各升一成左右，統丁亦好半成，成交約五百餘萬。</p>
<h3>業外物價回漲　食米市勢堅挺　特粳重見六千八百萬高價</h3>
<p>米市復升，因銀根轉鬆，業外物價挺升，人心堅昂，執貨者扣緊而售，米店添納亦多，市遂吿挺升二百至三百萬元。北市白粳六千二百五十萬，計挺三百五十萬元，羊秈挺三百萬，特高粳做六千八百萬元。南市各檔粳秈均挺二百萬元，嘉興新糙秈四千五百萬元，浦東新粳五千八百萬。昨日到貨南北二市共三千二百二十五石。</p>
<p>麺粉挺升，且上漲甚速，因銀根轉鬆，　外物價均漲，人心活躍，投機散戶進意頗濃。老車粉由二千二百五十萬，升至二千三百萬收市，軋升一百五十萬。兵船粉升二百萬，以二千二百五十萬收市，紅蜂及建成各漲二百萬，麩皮挺七八十萬，小麥客方與廠方談價未成，未有開出，價在三千一百萬元。</p>
<p>雜糧轉堅，困銀根稍見轉寬，米價之上漲，人心一致轉堅，且業外物似上挺，故貨主扳價甚力。黃豆挺百萬，實銷不暢。苞米新貨已多，市呈平平。元麥汕帮停納，北帮略取，挺升一二百萬元。蠶豆酌加百萬，菉豆去化甚呆，欲升乏力。芝蔴交易甚稀，價少上落。生仁初挺二百萬，後市續升，合挺七八百萬元。</p>
<p>食油急遽上挺，因上日下降過甚，況業外各物轉挺，銀根不緊，遂又引起買風，散戶吸納甚多。豆油初開一五五〇〇萬，後至一五八〇〇萬，臨收復高至一六二〇〇萬，軋升一千六百萬。生油交易較淸，略加七百萬，後市趨堅。生菜油收市出一四〇〇〇萬外，挺一成光景，小車蔴油漲一千萬。豆餅亦轉升，四牌餅終漲一百萬元。</p>
<h3>銀根趨勢鬆動　行局有少額差進</h3>
<p>昨日本市銀根，走勢鬆動，銀錢業票據交換中行局差進六七〇〇億。計國行差出五四四四億，中國銀行差進二〇四六〇億，交通銀行差出一〇一五一億，農民銀行差出八一八三億，中信局差進一三一八三億，郵　局差出二七六一億，中央合作金庫差出四〇四億。商業行莊大交換差出五〇〇七億，小交換差出二二六八五億，外商銀行共計差進二一五九二億。</p>
<h3>華茶外銷貸款額每擔五行中六百萬</h3>
<p>據輸管會息：政府爲促進華茶外銷，曾決定辦理外銷茶貸款，其貸額定爲每担一千萬元。嗣因國內物價上漲，收購成本增高，每担一千萬元之貸款，實不敷茶商之週轉，出口茶商曾一致要求，將每擔貸款核增至國幣八千萬元，現此項要求，業經國行貼放委員會留易顧問委員會決議，照其請求七折貸放，即出口茶貸每担核增爲國幣五千六百萬元，聞已在呈請貼放會考慮中，一經核准，即可如數貸放，對於今後華茶外銷，當裨益匪淺云。</p>
<p>又訊：昨日洋莊茶市，晨開尙在盤檔中，迨後趨勢又轉小康，行情復再步砌。原因爲輸出商對於紅綠茶，旣仍垂靑，而執主則以到存兩涸，一味扳售不鬆，致過程卒吿進展。至於內銷花色，一致追隨報挺。惟據業中人云：目前同業方面，大都迫於頭寸，致所漲頗屬和緩。</p>
<h3>國藥回挫</h3>
<p>國藥昨稍回落。近因外埠略需添辦，人心振奮，一號揀香，承前日漲勢，再竄二百萬，緊叩二千萬大關。印揀供求兩平，原油茴喊高一百七十萬，旋因內需轉懈，略見回落。較前日軋升十萬，爲一百五十萬。山甲片銷路活躍，價升六百五十萬。白大川外帮需求甚殷，一度高升至七百五十萬，旋因漲勢過鉅，辦客束手，反見呆滯。終因掮客傾吐，步步見跌至六百五十萬成交。西潞黨來絕去活，價遂步升，行商拆兌互做，計魁潞一千四百萬，秃潞一千二百萬，貢潞一千萬，西砂米價升五百五十萬。</p>
<h3>客帮競進新買活躍　棉紗布漲風又起　龍著呢曾沖破九千萬大關</h3>
<p>昨日棉紗市况，以隔日行局差出，銀根轉鬆，廠商有吸，津粤等帮採辦復盛，更因業外物價波動，市勢頓轉飛揚。</p>
<p>四十二支藍鳳細紗，晨開以紡建牌價上升三億餘，喊價亦即上竄三億，嗣因買多賣少，市再鋒俏，做高至三十二億五千萬現出，三十三億三千萬明日結束，比上日回漲三億五千萬至三千萬元。其他各支粗細紗，亦均軋升一二億及一成餘不一，成交七十一件。</p>
<p>昨日棉布市况，以上日午後外埠匯款來滬甚多，更有行局鉅額差出，銀根趨鬆，新買頓吿活躍，客帮趁低力進，聞北帮在塲外收進數量甚多，因此十二磅龍頭細布，初開竟喊九千萬大關，而無受主，旋較上日午收升一千零七十萬始有正式交易。市雖飛俏，但業中銀根依然緊迫，浮多頗有了售，至九點五十分許回小三百五十萬元。</p>
<p>十時後，因同業在八千萬檔子拋出龍頭甚夥，乘小補空者活躍，客帮號商亦來競吸，市盤冉冉上揚，最高達九千一百萬，近收回至八千八百二十萬元站住，較上日回漲一千一百四十萬元。其他各布交易頻繁，行情亦均挺秀，自三四百萬至一千餘萬不一，成交二千二百百疋。</p>
<p>又訊：龍頭午後塲外創新高價，後以買氣不懈，再度上竄至九千四百萬元，嗣因行局差進，市氣回軟，最後仍喊九千一百萬元。較午收好二百八十萬元，四君子元嗶嘰亦升二百五十萬元。</p>
<p>又訊：中紗昨代央行拋紗二一四件，金額計四六，五七二，〇〇〇萬元。又中紗牌概售布一〇三二〇疋，被單九〇條，零頭布一一〇〇四磅，收回通貨八一，七九八，五〇〇萬元。</p>
<h3>呢羢行情堅昂</h3>
<p>呢羢趨勢，昨仍明暗挺秀，行情堅昂，人心樂觀，零躉交易似較上週爲暢活。本街進胃以花呢華達呢爲夥，客帮需購，以大衣呢中厚嗶嘰爲多。顏色方面，深色買方選進頗股，淡色價雖頻降，然仍乏人問津。咖啡色大衣呢花呢宣維，風行頗盛，美國麥而登因貨底軋缺，及美票關係，喊價奇昂。</p>
<h3>經濟簡訊</h3>
<p>國行貼放委員工礦顧問委員會，昨日下午舉行第十九次會議，討論國策貸款曁業務貸款，共十九件。待下週貼放會核議。</p>

<h3>僑資投資辦法實行後　粵閩區僑匯可望增加</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕僑資以原料方式進口後之再生產問題，工業會籌備會負責人士曾訪輸管會霍主委有所洽商。據悉各方對於原料進口易成貨款後之運用問題，看法並不一致，政府方面對此筆頭寸是否將流入黑市刺激匯市一點，深表關心；而廠家所關切者，則爲如何使此筆貨款購買原料，參加再生產。聞主管當局爲愼重起見，將先向上級請示，再作決定。</p>
<p>輸出入管理委員會厦門區辦事處處長許鳳藻，日前因公來滬述職。據談：厦門爲僑匯集中地區，渦去因牌價與黑市相差過鉅，致紛紛逃避。結匯證明書辦法實行以後，仍未能趕上黑市，僑匯並不踴躍。最近准許僑資回國投資生產事業，僑胞可携帶物資進口，僑匯決能激增。准許僑胞携帶物資進口，本分處曾呈準實行，惟辦法簡單，範圍亦不廣泛，其成績尙不合理想。此次公佈之辦法，較過去完善，相信僑匯不致再逃避。過去准許輸入之物資，以南洋，菲律賓等處爲最多。其主要物資，爲橡膠，椰子油，及熟帶藥品等。又該區進口限額，五六兩季，共配十六萬餘美金，實際需要三十餘萬美金，相差一半。僑資新辦法實施後，已能抵補。</p>

<h3>美國棒球大王倍倍羅斯病逝　患癌症二年終於不治</h3>
<p>〔本報特譯合衆社紐約十六日電〕美國棒球大王「倚倍」羅斯，患癌症已逾二年，今日病况突變，不治逝世。上週末羅斯病况似見進步，竟可離牀起身，初不料突變之速。下午五時，紀念醫院發表緊急公報，謂羅斯病狀危急，至六時二十五分，遂與世長辭，臨終時，其夫人及二女兒友好數人在側。六時二十五分前，羅斯已入半昏迷狀態，其私人醫生海賽馬丁亦在，但無法挽救此一代棒球大王。</p>
<p>羅斯簡史</p>
<p>倍倍羅斯享年五十三歲，生於一八九四年二月七日。幼年極貧，竟竊取小販之香蕉充飢。但最後在棒球賽中，大展天才，以「全壘打大王」聞名，在紐約楊基隊中，年得薪酬八萬美元之鉅。在參加棒球聯賽二十二年中，共擊出全壘打共達七百十四次，而在一九二七年一季中，造成六十次全壘打之最高紀錄，迄今無人能予打破。羅斯參加紅襪隊六年，至一九二〇年，羅斯時年二十六歲，爲酒業大王路貝德上校賞識其運動天才，開始參加紐釣楊基隊，卒成爲全國運動著名人物。是時楊基隊奄奄不振，亦無自設球塲。路貝德知羅斯之號召力極大，乃投資二百萬美元，建造楊基隊棒球塲，此美國最偉大之運動王宮，於一九二三年落成，可謂因倍倍羅斯而創建。此楊基遝動場，可容觀衆七萬人，美國棒球聯賽，世界棒球決賽等，皆於此舉行。力使人永久不忘者，爲一九三二年世界棒球決賽，在支加哥對小熊隊，羅斯上塲，高叫此次將擊出一全壘打，球來棒落，果被擊中，直向中塲飛去，其準確有如此驚人者。羅斯退休後，其最後一次在球塲露面，爲一九四七年，全國棒球塲慶祝「倍倍羅斯節」，羅斯在楊基球塲作最後一次之表演。羅斯之前妻海倫伍特福，爲波士頓蘭特咖啡室之女侍，年十六歲時識羅斯，倍倍方參加紅襪隊，一見鍾情，海倫時時暗中以較其他顧客爲大之餅，送往饑餓之羅斯。於一九一四年十月結婚，此一對患難夫妻，不幸於十二年之後，終吿仳離。</p>

<h3>我世運足球隊八比一勝暹華</h3>

<h3>世運第二日　十萬觀衆視綫　集中百米決賽</h3>
<p>— 本報特約記者　鍾震</p>
<p>〔本報倫敦航訊〕的第二天。今天倫敦的天氣，依然是酷熱異常，雖然經昨天中午的一陣雷雨後，較前天稍爲凉爽些，可是當正午時，坐在沒遮蓋的公共看台上，仍是件難熬的事。今天往溫布萊運動塲的觀衆擁擠的情形，並不因天熱而稍减。據統計仍不下十萬人，魚貫進出會塲。至於倫敦市的居民，已看到過世運的，都紛紛避往英國各鄕村去休假，所以今天自早晨起，有二十萬倫敦市民前往各火宙站去搭車，使一般維持秩序的警士和車站職員，無法執行職務。同樣在公路上，也擠滿了各種車輛。如此盛况，在戰後的倫敦，的確是可稱爲空前。明日星期日，大會休息一天，可是各火事站的忙碌情形，預料不會有絲毫鬆懈，因爲在歐洲大陸上，又將趕來一批新的觀衆，來爭看田徑和球類的決賽。這樣無疑地使英國國庫，又可多收入一筆巨額的外匯。</p>
<p>在溫布萊的田徑塲上，今天上午舉行標槍，和跳高的拔選賽，下午有五萬米的競走，女子百米初賽，四百米跳欄決賽，和萬衆矚目的男子百米複賽和決賽。二時半男子百米複賽開始，在第一組美國黑人狄拉特和伊威爾各以十秒四列爲一·二名，英國麥高哥台以十秒七爲第三。在第二組中仍美國巴登以十秒四爲第一，七月三十日是奧林匹克世運會巴拿馬賴比區（黑人）以十秒五為第二，第三名也為英國人，並且也中叫麥克（唐納）。這次英國居然會有二個百米選手，能參加決賽，是歷屆世運所未有的事。所以這消息幾使倫敦市民瘋狂，當日各晚報中都用特大的鉛字，登載二個麥克的名字。百米決賽在三時四十五分舉行，看台上所有的觀衆，都凝神靜待，希望來一個打破世界的記錄。槍聲一響，十二條飛毛腿一致衝出，結果冠軍仍爲美國黑人狄拉特以十秒三平奧林匹克紀錄。與世界記錄十秒二，尙差〇·一秒。美黑人伊威爾十秒四，第二。第三是巴拿馬賴比區，第四是英國麥克高哥台，美巴登及英麥克唐納具萊分列五·六。由此可見黑人之短跑能力，遠勝白人。四百米跳欄的美柯區崙以五十一秒一打破世運記錄，列冠軍，可是與世界紀錄五十秒六，尙差不少。在皇家游泳池中今天亦有精彩跳水表演，和男子百米自由式決賽，結果，美國李斯以五十七秒三爲冠軍，創奧林匹克新記錄，但與世界紀錄五十五秒四仍不可比。第二爲英福特，第三是匈牙利。今天所有的成績，均未能如理想中之美滿。此或者是受天時的影響，然而曾在報章中喧傳過的驚人新記錄，或者亦祗是偶然碰巧而已。</p>

<h3>螢</h3>
<p>— 白永</p>
<p>時屆中元，天河配已竟過了繁榮季節，難免想到杜司勛的名句：「天街夜色凉如水，臥看牽牛織女星」了，雖然夜色未凉，殘暑尙酷。</p>
<p>關於螢，我總覺得像一個小品的好題目，無奈又想不出什麽多餘的話來。除了前面的詩句之外，還殘留着幼年在村熟念詩經「東山」的句子，一町　鹿塲，熠燿脊行，不可畏也，伊可懷也。」起初只是扯着喉嚨喊喊，一直到上中學，才曉得宵行就是螢火。我家雖然濱河而居，却並不是所謂「卑濕之地」，因此「腐草」等等也就不大「化爲螢」，所以幼年對於螢火的印象幾乎等於沒有。</p>
<p>後來住在北平，那裏有的是闊大庭院，古舊房屋，即使是「大雜院兒」也有很大的空地給人在夜間乘凉看星月，不至像南京上海似的，被小如豆付干一樣的天井逼到馬路上或弄堂中去。從前北京的電燈不甚普遍，在小酸棗樹或是海棠樹　中，晚上放着幽香的草茉莉與一夜來香一根下，總會看到那一小團帶點靑綠色的微光，小孩子不曉事，有時甚至感到一點輕微的畏懼，終於，變成了喜悅，隨着追來追去，把他收集到小玻璃瓶中比賽光的大小，而往往在這偶時候，小虫子的燈却自動熄滅了，使小孩子發出不快意的嘆息。</p>
<p>就是這一點光，討了人們乃至萬物的寵愛，螢火雖微，亦即殊有其偉大。龍樹菩薩「大智度論一云：</p>
<p>「譬如螢火虫，日未出時，少多能照，若日出時，千光明照，月及衆星，皆無有明，豈况螢火！」</p>
<p>佛家的話，雖然鈍根多不能領會，若如此說，却是非常令人有所省怡。吾人在世，多半毀謗平凡，以爲不能慴駭流俗，不知所謂一粥一飯，一絲一縷，却是無一不從平凡中得來，其偉大比之英雄作戰，殺人萬千，固自不可以道里計矣。而况此又是黑暗無邊之中一點爝火，古人傳說如車武子用他照了讀書，自然是附會不可信，（法布爾昆虫記說：「假如拿一個螢火在一行文字上移動，黑暗中可以看得出一個個字母，或者整個的字，假如並不太長。可是這狹小的地面以外，什麽也都看不見了。這樣的燈光會使讀者失去耐性的。」照此說來，囊螢亦殊不易，車武子果能作到這步工夫，亦可謂鐵杵磨針矣。）可是你知道在無邊的黑暗之中，對於一點亮光的期待是何等心焦的事。莊子所說澈西江之水，穌涸轍之鮒，雖是開玩笑的寓言，若以大智度論中所說待日出時爲喻，實亦有使人不可忍耐之意，與車武子之囊螢正是異曲同工者也。太陽照澈萬物，自己並無居功之意，螢火亦是如此，吾人可以使之照讀，但彼何嘗不可熄了燈而不理。這個意思，與太陽之能使星月無明，也無軒輊。所以人最是卑瑣，無論什麽皆以功利爲衡，而又計較其大小，則誠矣其爲不可堪矣。</p>
<p>還有一件奇事，我也不妨附帶一談，就是法布爾發現了螢的食物竟是比他大上幾十倍的蝸牛。他能用一種麻醉劑把蝸牛弄昏，然後吸他的汁液。中國本有「丹鳥　白烏」之說，即是螢蟲吃蚊子，見夏小正，本是不經之談，可是不料他的眞正食品會比蚊蟲更大，眞乃「亦一異也」。我常說：光明之處，也有危險，莫非螢火也不例外嗎？</p>

<h3>故都二老</h3>
<p>— 銖安</p>
<p>故都近來有兩位八十以上的老畫家，齊白石與黃賓虹是也。瀕老（白石字瀕生，他的名字叫璜，取田於渭濱之意，於今果然年尊望重，竟成預兆。）他的住宅是他自己賣畫錢積蓄起來購置的，他素有善於居積之名，據說房產不止一處，所以晚景頗爲不惡，只因小心過甚，房間箱匣，鑰匙纍纍，佩帶隨身，好像减少了雅人風趣，其實他爲人是極慷慨而重風義的，其雅在心而不在形式。賓老在北平只住了十年，中經離亂，閉門不與外事，自得其樂，與瀕老同，而精神之健似猶過之。瀕老室中，從來不掛一張字畫，坐上也沒有一樣古玩，除作畫外，沒有別的嗜好。賓老則一間斗室，雖然小到不足回旋，而所讀的書，從地上一直堆到頂篷，頂篷已經坍了下來，書沾了雨，他也不介意。他的書並不講究板本，但是很多專門而罕見的，他尤其喜歡搜羅鄉邦文獻，考證表彰，不遺餘力。案上堆滿了古印古玉之屬，雖然自己不再刻印章，對於金石文字，仍常常有新的見解，喜歡用　文寫聯語，隨手送人，毫不吝惜。求畫的人雖然很多，每大早起，還要用粗紙臨古人的畫，完全爲的是自娛，不雜絲毫名利之心。他的物質生活簡單之至，然遇琉璃廠人送字畫來，只要眞是上乘，他不惜重價收購，比人家買他的畫，出的價高多了。出其餘技，從事園藝，在塵封　蝕的書架上，可以發現他手種的昌蒲，在北方乾冷的氣候中，這是很不容易做到的；尤其矮矮的一扇板門旁邊，恐怕只有三尺地，手種了一叢瘦竹，眞令人消盡塵俗之氣。賓老現已南歸，他的北平故居，不知將來誰寫入續日下舊聞矣。</p>
<h3>叔範病起廢酒式賦復飲　詩二章甚美次韵調之</h3>
<p>— 沈禹鐘</p>
<p>施髯我畏友，相愛不敢狎，一樓數晨昏，有酒意便適；看人眼難靑，閱世心自察，酒酣詩獨豪，氣若雷電製，詞淸水同瀉，理深淵莫測，詩成酒復縱，念亂情更惻。入夏忽病　，偃臥斷杯酌，身病心豈病？這味轉能洽。一枕消日長，手稿自删削，推枕起覓酒，形影成主客，燈熖　酒波，相望在咫尺。</p>
<p>病起復能飲，池荷爲君　，回首藥裏中，日月去如陷；世事　局翻，浮　凈一念，朝來杯在手，於此可遠　，流風懷鑑湖，淸狂思賀監！余亦舊酒徒，酒膽隨年减，滄桑抑好懷，鬢髮端可驗。子眞豪傑人，不肯改沈湎，朝揖二豎去，午夢落村店，酒陳看再張，要使羣怪憚，以此主天下，定息蒼生歎。</p>
<h3>不祥之夢</h3>
<p>— 起鳳</p>
<p>一八六五年的某一個下午，林肯總統的內閣閣員們走進了會議廳預備開會的當兒，發覺總統坐在桌首的主席位上，把臉埋在手掌中。頃刻之問，他抬起了頭，臉色是疲憊而又嚴肅。</p>
<p>總統說：「諸位，我要吿訴你們一個重要的消息。」</p>
<p>「你有什麼壞消息嗎？還是發生了什麽嚴重的事？一有幾位議員關心地問。</p>
<p>總統說：「我沒有聽到什麽，也沒有什麼消息。但是昨晚我做了一個夢，夢見我在一艘小船上，孤零零地，沒有槳，也沒有舵，在無邊的大海上，失去了任何的援助。」</p>
<p>沉默了一會，總統又繼續說；「在戰爭的時候，我曾經有過好幾次像那樣的夢，每次在夢後的一二天之內總有一次大戰發生。諸位，也許明天，也許在幾小時後，你們就會得着緊要的消息了。」</p>
<p>五小時後，林肯就被刺了。</p>
<p>這究竟是迷信呢，還是命運呢？</p>
<h3>專家位的故事</h3>
<p>— 柳生</p>
<p>大家都知道，美國是一個科學發達的國家。他們重視科學，隨時都可以聽到專家們的意見。這裏就是一些美國專家們的故事。</p>
<p>最近，北達可大州許多公路專家準備開一次會，來檢討修路的問題。但結果大多數會員都不能出席，祗好改期再開。會員不能到會的原因是：公路太壞，雨後全是爛泥，汽車無法行駛。</p>
<p>紐傑賽州的醫院裏來了一個小病人，他出世祗十九個月，却呑了一枚別針，骾在喉頭。醫院裏的幾位專門醫師和他拍了一張經X光照片，吿訴他的父母說，要救孩子的性命，非動手術不可——但是這手術也頗有危險性。父母正在躊躇不決之際，那小孩子忽然打了一個大噴嚏，「阿嚏」聲中，那只別針「噴」了出來。</p>
<p>在　海沃州春田地方，有一個駕駛汽車極謹愼的人，許多年來從沒有惹過禍或違犯交通規則。當局爲嘉獎起見，特贈獎章一枚。此人欣喜之餘，約了許多朋友歡宴一塲，以示慶賀。宴罷歸家，那位得獎的先生在半途中被交通警察擱住了汽車——他的車子開得歪歪斜斜，原來他已經醉了。「酒醉駕駛汽車」，正好違犯了交通規則。</p>
<p>烏太州的鹽湖城內，許多建築專家開會，商量防止火警的辦法。他們聯袂出巡，看看城內那幾幢房子有危險性。結果發現了一座防火設備最壞的房子——當地的中央救火會。　芝加哥的一只學校裏，有一天敎師在敎授急救法。不想先生在敎人工呼吸的時候，突然氣閉暈倒，學生們就立刻用其所學，對他們的老師施以人工呼吸，總算把他救活。</p>
<h3>靜坐經驗談（一）</h3>
<p>— 江問漁</p>
<p>我從民國三十五年四月底，至今年（三十七年）八月中。從事學習「因是子靜坐法」，恰恰滿了二十七個月，中間並沒有間斷過一天。現在我願意把這二十七個月的實際經驗，很忠實的很客觀的作成一篇報吿，吿諸世人。我何以要習靜坐法？</p>
<p>我的身體，比較尙屬强健，在中年以前，讀書，作文，做事，頗能耐得勞苦，就工作重一些，睡眠少一些，還不會感到十分疲倦。不意在五十歲後，忽然發見血壓高病，有時血壓竟高到一百九十度以上，雖經打針服藥，未見輕减。抗日軍典，由滬西行入川，奔走各方，工作並未停止。在二十九年冬初，得了一次大吐血病，吐血停了，血壓高依然，有時且達二百度以上，因此身體日見瘦弱，用腦之事，不能再做，其時年已六十了。三十五年春，由渝返至滬寓，以爲到了上海，人事旣繁，事又不能不做，如何是好？適任職於鴻英圖書館，長館務者爲蔣竹莊先生，我副之，竹老因勸我習靜坐法，謂「靜坐久，一定可以愈君疾」。我於竹老所著「因是子靜坐法」一畫，二十多年前，已經讀過，當時並且或作或　的坐了些時，至是乃復詳讀，且決意一試，遂於三十五年四月二十七日正式開始。</p>
<p>習靜坐之初，卽決定兩項志願。</p>
<p>我旣深信這個靜坐法，可以健身，且足以療我血壓高病，又深深有鑒於以往習靜坐或作或　的失計，乃預先定下兩種志願：一是「決心」，以爲我不習靜坐則已，旣習，必深信不疑的認定這個方法，確切有效，絕不懷疑，絕不畏難。一是「有恒」，以爲旣經下了決心去坐，一定要持之以恒，無論如何困難，如何忙碌，決不讓牠一日間斷。這兩個志願決定之後，便開始實行，實行後最初幾個月遇到阻碍和困難，確是不少，但我總是本着堅持到底的決心，視此同吃飯和睡覺一樣，以爲少了牠便不能究成我的生活，因此在經過二十七個月中，從沒有一天間斷過。此時我可以大膽的說：不但過去兩年多，不間斷，就是從今以後，也是一天不間斷，並且到了現在，已經入了作境，更是「欲罷不能」了。</p>
<p>我所採用的靜坐方式和方法悉依竹老書中所說，有時且經過他老人家的口授指示。坐時單盤膝，（因爲年紀較大，不能雙盤膝。）腰挺直，目微閉，右手握左手之背，仰置小腿上，（但有時兩手亦可分置兩膝上。）行深細呼吸，吸氣時腹部　入，呼氣時腹部凸起，使橫隔　運動；同時腦神經安靜，務使雜念不起，凝神注意到腹部。每次靜坐約經過一小時，或者五十分鐘。冬季天氣冷時，於晚間就寢前行之，其他三季皆在晨間起身後行之。每日一次，視爲常課。（有時也有行兩次的。）一吸一呼爲一單位，通常默數呼吸一二三四五……，至一百次爲一組。用自然的態度和努力，使呼吸時間漸漸延長。坐時在床上，有時　以軟物，使臀部略高，膝部低下，上體略略向前。</p>
<p>（但不墊軟物亦無妨。）</p>

<h3>Please Eliminate Communist Bandits and Stabilize the Rear Order - The Executive Yuan Promulgates Items Requiring Attention: Those Encouraging Strikes and Impairing Production Shall Be Sent to Special Criminal Courts for Handling. Strict Prohibition of Student Strikes, Parades, Mass Gatherings, and Petitions.</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 17th] It is reported that, in view of the fact that communist bandits have secretly planted spies in our rear areas, taking the opportunity to incite chaos and attempt to open up their so-called "second front" to echo the bandit army, the government shares the indignation of frontline soldiers and the general public. Recently, student and worker unrest has occurred repeatedly in various places, with professional students occupying schools, manipulating the masses, and engaging in wanton riots, which have a serious impact on social order. On the 17th, the Executive Yuan issued orders to the local administrative and security organs, listing the items requiring attention for quelling the chaos in the rear, and instructed the relevant agencies to thoroughly eliminate the communist bandits and stabilize the rear order in accordance with criminal laws and regulations. The full text is as follows:</p>
<p>Upon investigation, the communist bandits are wantonly wreaking havoc and endangering the country. They not only resort to armed robbery and arson everywhere, but also secretly plant spies in our rear areas, taking the opportunity to instigate trouble. They either launch student and worker unrest, plotting riots, or spread rumors to undermine security. The relevant agencies have either failed to take strict precautions or have failed to seriously investigate and punish. At this time of comprehensive suppression of the rebellion, stabilizing order and eliminating communist bandits are essential for protecting the safety of the people and defending the foundation of the country. Therefore, the following four points are listed regarding the items requiring attention in the rear during the period of quelling the rebellion: (1) In accordance with Article 3 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, when judicial police agencies legally arrest defendants, if there are indeed facts to believe that someone is committing a crime inside and the situation is urgent, they may directly search residences or other places without a search warrant. However, places that should be kept secret for military purposes may not be searched without the permission of the relevant commander, and no unwarranted disturbance should be caused to maintain order. (2) With regard to the acts of bandits inciting strikes and other acts sufficient to impair production, close contact should be made with the competent administrative organs to strictly prohibit them. Those who violate the prohibition shall be transferred to the Special Criminal Court for handling in accordance with the law. (3) With regard to students in various schools who, with the intention of obstructing the quelling of the rebellion, engage in strikes, parades, mass gatherings, and petitions, disrupting public order, or who incite through writing or oral persuasion, propagating for the bandits, and undermining order, they should be resolutely prohibited, stopped, or dispersed. Important current offenders should be arrested and sent to the Special Criminal Court for handling in accordance with the law. (4) Responsible personnel of all agencies, organizations, and schools shall be truly responsible for maintaining order in their agencies, organizations, and schools. If they discover anyone inside who is plotting the acts listed in the preceding two items, they shall report to the local security organs and assist in collecting evidence as much as possible. Those who violate this shall be punished.</p>

<h3>Investigation of the "July 5th" Incident Completed - The Executive Yuan Decides to Handle with Caution. Qin Dechun Yesterday Visited Weng Wenhao to Report on His Mission</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 17th] Qin Dechun, Deputy Minister of National Defense, flew back to Nanjing on the 17th with Vice President Li. Before leaving, he told reporters that he had originally intended to return to Nanjing later, but Minister He relayed the President's order by long-distance telephone on the 16th, requiring him to return to Nanjing on the 16th. However, he could not make it that day. Whether he would go to Guling would depend on the orders he received after visiting President Weng in Nanjing. He said: "I am only responsible for the investigation. I am unwilling to participate in opinions on how to handle it. I firmly believe that my investigation report is absolutely fair, with equal emphasis on science and technique. I have asked the government to pay attention to the resettlement of displaced students. However, the report failed to pinpoint the exact responsibility for the so-called first shot and the student seizure of guns. The first shot may be impossible to determine, so both sides of the evidence are listed in the report." Regarding the issue of responsibility, Qin said: "Commander-in-Chief Fu has no major responsibility, but because he is the highest responsible person in North China, he is very concerned. Commander-in-Chief Chen Jicheng expressed that as long as it is beneficial to the country, he is willing to let the central authorities handle it." Regarding the 208th Division, Qin said: "The division commander may have no responsibility."</p>
<p>Who Fired the First Shot? No Definite Evidence</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 17th] Qin Dechun, the Deputy Minister who went to Beiping to investigate the "July 5th" incident, returned to Nanjing by special plane from Beiping at 2:01 PM on the 17th with Vice President Li. After a brief rest, Qin visited President Weng at 9:00 PM that evening to report on the investigation in Beiping. President Weng inquired in detail about the course of the "July 5th" incident and the responsibility for the shooting at that time, and expressed that after the reports from all parties were sent to the Executive Yuan, the matter would be handled carefully based on the reports from all parties. Qin spent a total of eleven days in Beiping. In addition to visiting military and political circles, the council, students, and journalists in Beiping, he also personally inspected the scene several times. He obtained a great deal of information about the situation on that day. As for who fired the first shot and the reason for the shooting, the information provided by all parties was different, but there was a lack of definite evidence, so it was still impossible to make a concrete judgment. When Qin left Beiping, he exchanged views with Supervisors Gu Fengxiang and Hu Wenhui, who were sent by the Supervisory Yuan to Beiping to investigate the "July 5th" incident, and asked the two supervisors to collect more information for comparison. Gu and Hu will also return to Nanjing in a day or two.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Shenyang, 17th] President Weng telegraphed the Northeast Suppression Headquarters on the 16th, stating: "According to Deputy Minister Qin Dechun's investigation report, the truth of the 'July 5th' incident is that most of the responsibility has been determined, and the handling method will be decided in the near future. I hope you will wait for the central government to resolve it."</p>
<h3>Supervisors' Report Completed - Believed to Be Fairly Resolved</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Beiping, 17th] Supervisors Gu Fengxiang and Hu Wenhui issued a public statement on the 17th regarding the investigation work of the "July 5th" incident, stating: "The 'July 5th' incident occurred more than a month ago. The central government attaches great importance to this unfortunate incident. Therefore, at the beginning of the month, Deputy Minister Qin Dechun of the Ministry of National Defense was sent to Beiping to investigate. The Supervisory Yuan also sent Fengxiang and Wenhui to Beiping based on the resolution of the General Assembly, using the Supervisory Yuan's solemn position and legal perspective to investigate the truth of the case and whether the local responsible officials had any improper handling and dereliction of duty, so as to handle it according to law. After more than ten days of investigation, based on the information provided by fair local gentlemen, Chinese and foreign reporters present, and Chinese and foreign individuals, as well as the reports and documents of relevant agencies, we have conducted analysis and research with an objective and calm attitude, and have inspected the scene several times and inquired about relevant personnel, and have obtained the truth. In addition to telegraphing the main points and handling opinions of this case to the Supervisory Yuan for verification, a detailed report has also been completed, and we will return to Nanjing in the next few days to report on our mission. We believe that this case will definitely be fairly resolved in the near future."</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Shenyang, 17th] Legislator Wang Huayi returned to Shenyang from Beiping on the 16th. According to reports, the "July 5th" incident will be resolved in the near future. The President is extremely concerned. After the reports are compiled, the handling method will be approved. It is heard that the main points of the handling method are: (1) The company and platoon leaders who ordered the shooting will be sentenced to death; (2) Chen Jicheng and Duan Yun will be dismissed; (3) Xu Huidong will be subject to disciplinary sanctions by the party and criminal prosecution.</p>
<h3>Students of Pingxi University Clash with Police</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 17th] At 2:00 PM on the 17th, three students from Shanxi University who were occupying Yingtai in Zhongnanhai clashed with the guarding police on the west coast of Yingtai. One of them, Sun Ding, was taken to the guard room by the police. More than 100 students, upon hearing the news, rushed to the front gate of Zhongnanhai and surrounded the guard room. It was then heard that Sun Ding was injured inside, so they broke in and a fight broke out. As a result, several people were injured on both sides.

The students are demanding that responsibility be investigated, the siege lifted, and classes resume quickly.</p>

<h3>Plan to Revitalize Our Industry - Ropke and Steelman Carry it to Nanjing Today - Denial of Freezing US Aid Proceeds</h3>
<p>[Our City News] The Economic Cooperation Administration announced yesterday that the recommendations regarding China's industrial revitalization and major equipment replacement plan proposed by the ECA will be submitted to Premier Weng Wenhao of the Executive Yuan in Nanjing on the 19th by ECA Resident Representative to China Ropke and Industrial Investigation Team Leader Steelman.</p>
<p>Under the total amount of US$275 million in aid to China, the initial figure in the proposal is US$60 million for industrial revitalization and US$10 million for the replacement of major equipment. The publication of the final recommendation has been delayed for a long time because a group of American technical experts under Steelman has been investigating China's industrial situation since June of this year and has only now completed the report on its findings.</p>
<p>Ropke and Steelman will fly to Nanjing on the morning of the 18th and will inspect Qingdao on the 20th. They will return to Shanghai on the 22nd.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Our City News] Ropke, Director of the China Branch of the US Economic Cooperation Administration, and Yan Jiagan, a member of the US Aid Utilization Committee, jointly denied yesterday the rumors in the newspapers in Nanjing and Shanghai that a decision was made at a meeting in Nanjing on the 13th to freeze the proceeds from the sale of US aid materials. It is said that the issue of the use of the proceeds from the sale of US aid materials was not discussed at the meeting on that day. Ropke also said that the rumors that the ECA had obstructed the economic stabilization plan decided at the Mogan Mountain meeting were unfounded. Ropke emphasized that the ECA has never had formal or informal relations with the Mogan Mountain meeting, and he only learned about the Mogan Mountain meeting after reading the newspapers.</p>
<p>[Our City News] The China Branch of the Economic Cooperation Administration stated that the food situation in Shenyang is improving due to the rapid implementation of assistance by the Economic Cooperation Administration and the US Aid Utilization Committee. According to Walter, the US Consul General in Shenyang, 25 tons of wheat seeds have been sown in the sorghum fields in Shenyang that have been damaged by insects. It is expected that these 25 tons of seeds will produce at least 450 tons of grain. Another 75 tons of buckwheat seeds are currently being purchased in Beiping for airlift to Shenyang.</p>

<p>[Central News Agency, New York, 16th] Vice Premier Chen Lifu and his wife arrived here from Paris on the 16th. It is reported that Chen will stay here and in San Francisco for a while before returning to China.</p>
<p>[Another dispatch] Chen Lifu said: Unless the Chinese people defeat the communist bandits, China "will be controlled by the Soviet Union." Commenting on the activities of the communist bandits, Chen said: "We are in difficult times because the Communist Party has many troops.

He believes that the UK's economic control is the best, the UK's inflation is the lowest, and the implementation of the rationing system aims to reduce the gap between rich and poor. According to reports, Chen is scheduled to go to San Francisco at the end of the month and transfer back to China.</p>
<h3>North China Military and Political Conference - Holds Group Discussions</h3>

<h3>Trade Limit with Japan - Executive Yuan Approves Relaxation - Private Business Representatives to be Dispatched Every Three Months</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch on the 17th] Ministry of Industry and Commerce News: Trade between our country and Japan is gradually developing, which domestic industrial and commercial circles highly value, and many have requested to participate. However, the current regulations in our country on the trade limit with Japan are considered too narrow and insufficient to meet the needs of the national industrial and commercial circles. It seems appropriate to relax them. In view of this, the Ministry of Industry and Commerce previously submitted a document to the Executive Yuan, proposing that private business representatives to Japan be dispatched every three months, with 60 to 100 people in each batch, and the duration of their stay in Japan would be appropriately extended based on actual needs. We have now received an order from the Executive Yuan stating, "The quota of representatives should be changed to 50 to 80 people per batch, and the rest should be handled as requested."</p>
<h3>Deadline for Payment for Purchased Japanese Reparations Materials - Mid-September</h3>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Explanation of the Reduction in Public Utility Price Hikes - A Sincere Appeal for the Central Government to Pay Attention to This Issue -</h3>
<p>The issue of price increases by the eight major public utility companies in Shanghai in August caused a great stir in the city a few days ago, as if a major unexpected event was about to occur. The new prices for August increased three or fourfold for each company, with some reaching nearly ten million times the pre-war prices, causing the general public to feel threatened in their lives. Not only did they find it psychologically unbearable, but most people simply could not afford it. Therefore, there was a brewing resistance movement among the people to refuse payment. Fortunately, the Shanghai Municipal Council, representing five million people in Shanghai, considered both the livelihood of the citizens and the maintenance of social order, and felt that a more reasonable solution should be found in any case. Therefore, it convened a temporary meeting on the 15th and immediately decided on three measures to reduce the new prices. Fortunately, Mayor Wu, in implementing the plan, spared no effort in persuading the company authorities together with the Speaker and Deputy Speaker of the Municipal Council and the convener of the Public Utilities Committee, as well as various councilors, in the past two days. Although the company representatives initially firmly refused to reduce prices, they were finally moved by the Mayor, Speaker, and others. After the Municipal Government and the Municipal Council jointly assumed responsibility for requesting a loan from the Central Bank to cover the shortfall in revenue for August, the company representatives resolutely accepted the price reduction in order to maintain the livelihood of the citizens and social order. This major event, which could have led to unexpected turmoil, was spared from reaching a deadlock.</p>
<p>We are extremely impressed with the Mayor's patience in this matter, and we also truly recognize that the Municipal Council, as an organ, fulfilled its responsibility as representatives of the citizens and made an impartial resolution.</p>
<p>Mayor Wu and Director Zhao of the Public Utilities Bureau were subjected to excessive criticism from the outside world at the beginning of this incident, but they were able to endure hardship and work hard to mediate. It is difficult to have such patience without deeply understanding the samadhi of endurance. Many things in the world cannot be accomplished without going through countless twists and turns and being tempered thousands of times. Therefore, those who merely act on a momentary impulse are not enough to talk about this. The Mayor had already anticipated in early June that public utilities would have price adjustments that citizens could not afford and firmly telegraphed the central government to resign. However, because it was not approved, he devoted himself to solving the problem. It can be seen that the Mayor was by no means only concerned about the company's side and ignored the burden on the citizens. The Municipal Council had already made statements and appeals to the central government twice, in March and June, on how to stabilize public utility prices, and in fact, they have repeatedly consulted with the municipal authorities to negotiate loans and purchase foreign exchange to pre-purchase fuel. This is enough to prove that they, as councilors, do not simply reduce the burden on the citizens and ignore the difficulties of the company's business operations. Now, finally, all the companies have reined in and accepted the Municipal Council's resolution and the Mayor's concrete implementation plan. The sparks of fire are unlikely to start a prairie fire. We congratulate Shanghai here and also congratulate the whole country!</p>
<p>However, the problem has not been completely solved and still requires full understanding and decisive action by the central and local authorities and all citizens to weigh the priorities.</p>
<p>We must first point out that the reason for the excessive price increases of public utilities lies less in the public utilities themselves and more in the continuous increase in foreign exchange rates, the sharp rise in general prices, and the daily depreciation of the currency, which are all links in a serious general economic problem. Public utilities seem to not have enough revenue to cover their expenses, but general industries and businesses and citizens really feel unable to bear the burden, especially most people who rely on wages for their livelihoods. Therefore, the responsibility for remedying the difficulties of public utilities cannot be completely attributed to the local authorities. Moreover, the skyrocketing prices of public utilities, such as human service prices, will inevitably affect general prices, and the result of skyrocketing general prices will hurt the national treasury the most. Therefore, it is the central government's natural and inescapable responsibility to stabilize the prices of public utilities.</p>
<p>Secondly, it must be pointed out that the reason for this dispute, which almost caused a huge uproar, is that an additional 50% was added to the July index in the formula for calculating prices. Regardless of whether this is reasonable or not, since it is a formula, why change and add to it arbitrarily? Conversely, why can't the citizens demand changes and reductions? The company originally requested to prepay a certain amount, and the municipal government made this suggestion to accommodate the facts. However, the Ministry of Industry and Commerce subsequently filed the case without any consideration, and even promoted this bad example to various places. They held great power but never considered the people's ability to bear the burden, which is truly regrettable. Now that the 50% has been canceled, the new prices can be reduced. If the companies really have a shortage of funds in August and cannot make ends meet, the central government, for the sake of expediency and to eliminate hidden dangers, should give full sympathetic consideration to the compromise plan and emergency appeal of the municipal government and municipal council, and use loan methods to overcome the difficulties of August. As for the prices starting in September, it is hoped that the Public Utility Open Investigation and Review Committee of this city will be established this afternoon and actively start work, so that there will be more reasonable regulations by the beginning of next month. At the same time, it is also hoped that the citizens will share the difficulties, trust this review mechanism, and do their best to plan for the daily needs of the citizens, such as water, electricity, and transportation, while taking both sides into consideration. All threatening and激烈的言論 and actions should be avoided at this time, and we should wait for the fair handling of the review committee, and not be taken advantage of by those with ulterior motives to incite them.</p>
<p>Finally, we especially want to ask the central government to pay attention to this problem in Shanghai! Because if this problem cannot be solved fairly and reasonably and forces the people to be unable to bear the burden, it may cause water and electricity outages, industrial and commercial stagnation, a sharp increase in unemployment, and social unrest. If Shanghai reaches this state, is this what the central government expects? Stability is the first priority in suppressing chaos; production is the most important thing in the economy. The relationship between Shanghai and the overall situation of the country is by no means comparable to that of an ordinary city or town. How to maintain social stability and how to keep production uninterrupted must start with the government and the people working together to maintain public utilities, and each public utility company should also organize its business and fulfill its responsibilities!</p>
<h3>Hubei Education Director Wang Wenjun Ordered to Reorganize Hubei Normal College - Measures for Relieving Henan Province's Refugee Students Agreed Upon</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch on the 17th] The National Hubei Normal College has been ordered to disband and reorganize due to student brawls. The college's President Wang Zhifu's firm resignation has been approved, and a reorganization committee has been established, headed by Hubei Education Director Wang Wenjun, to take over the college's affairs and thoroughly reorganize it.</p>
<p>[Our Hankou Dispatch on the 17th] After Vice Minister Hang exchanged views with relevant parties on the disbandment of the National Hubei Normal College, a reasonable solution may be obtained through the following channels: (1) The disbandment order must still be implemented thoroughly, but the school will relax the standards during re-registration so as not to create too many problems. (2) The 25 students accused of destroying residences will mostly be given a non-prosecution disposition after court interrogation due to insufficient evidence. (3) Wang Zhifu's intention to resign is very firm, and candidates for president and school affairs reorganizer will be selected separately. (4) Although the students have expressed opposition to the disbandment, there have been no excessive actions due to public opinion and fair comments from all walks of life. Furthermore, Vice Minister Hang has repeatedly stated that he will handle the matter based on the principle of caring for young people, so the general reaction is good. The plan to petition in Beijing is expected to be cancelled.</p>
<p>[Another Dispatch] Vice Minister Hang continued to discuss relevant educational issues with all parties on the 17th, and met with representatives of Henan province's refugee students again at 10:00 a.m., announcing the current relief measures. It has been agreed that the Central China剿匪 Headquarters and the Hankou Municipal Government will jointly be responsible for raising funds with the Henan Association of Fellow Villagers in Hankou to provide food. After they return to Beijing, they will submit a request to the central government to allocate funds from the Hankou Relief Special Donation to provide relief. It is said that the representatives are quite satisfied. However, the accommodation is increasingly insufficient and needs assistance from all parties. Hang is scheduled to fly to Beijing on the 18th to report back.</p>
<p>[Another Dispatch] Regarding the reorganization of Hubei Normal College and the relief of refugee students from Henan province who have come to Hankou, Vice Minister Hang has agreed on the following measures with the relevant authorities: (1) The Hubei Normal College Reorganization Committee will be composed of nine members, including Xu Huizhi, Chen Shi, Gong Wenjun, and Wang Zhifu, with Wang Wenjun (Director of Education) as the convener, to discuss proper reorganization measures immediately, but the college will not be closed down. (2) In addition to temporarily providing food and lodging for refugee students from Henan province, it has also been decided that the provincial and municipal education authorities will consider the situation of various schools in Wuhan and first arrange for some of them to study, and the remaining will be properly resolved after Hang returns to Beijing. After Vice Minister Hang announced the measures for handling Hubei Normal College, the students of the college still had some objections. Students from the Physical Education College, Art College, Huazhong University, Wuhan University, and other schools organized the "United Association to Protest the Ministry of Education's Unreasonable Disbandment of Hubei Normal College" this afternoon, demanding that the Ministry of Education withdraw its order and not sacrifice students under the pretext.</p>

<p>[Our Beiping Dispatch on the 17th] After the end of the Beiping 行轅, the scenic spot of Zhongnanhai has become the focus of attention of all levels. The municipal government and the North China剿匪 Headquarters negotiated to reopen it as a park and scheduled it to open on the 15th, but because Shanxi University occupied Yingtai, followed by the entire Beiping Special Criminal Court moving in on the 16th and occupying Jinggu, plus more than 200 households of military officers and their families from the former 行轅 still have not moved out, and some people who have not been permitted have moved in, and there are rumors that the destruction of various famous places is very serious. All kinds of incidents have not been resolved reasonably, and the municipal authorities are quite troubled. Therefore, the Zhongnanhai of today has become a disaster-ridden place. The shortage of housing in Beiping is a serious problem. The municipal authorities have recently decided to adjust it and will start investigating vacant houses soon, and strictly stipulate that each landlord is only allowed to occupy ten rooms as a base number for every two people, and one room will be added for each additional person. If they do not rent it out themselves after the investigation, they will be forced to rent it out. If this measure can be implemented thoroughly, the disputes over the occupation of public housing may be resolved.</p>
<h3>Ironclad Proof of Communist Spies Manufacturing Student Unrest (Part 1)</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 17th] The relevant authorities have recently released an article containing ironclad proof of communist spies inciting pure students to create student unrest. The original text is as follows:</p>
<p>I. The Communist Youth Movement Organization and Its International Background</p>
<p>The communist party's youth movement work, which deceives young people, is directly planned and led by the communist party's "Central Youth Department," with the "Youth Work Committee" of the bogus China Democratic League headquarters as its peripheral leadership center. Its core organization is the "Democratic Youth League." The Chinese "Democratic Youth League" is a constituent unit of the Comintern's Red Youth International organization, the "World Federation of Democratic Youth," with its headquarters in Harbin. Recently, to facilitate the direct rule of youth in the communist areas, the "Democratic Youth League" organizations within the communist areas were renamed "Mao Zedong Youth League." Furthermore, spies and students lurking in government areas were used to establish various national student organizations, forming new national youth peripheral organizations that directly received the instigation and guidance of the communist "Central Youth Department."</p>
<p>As for the national student organizations established by communist spies under the orders of the communist party, the "Kunming Student Union," formed using the so-called "December 1st" incident, was the beginning of their use of student inter-school organizations to create student unrest and expand their influence. Therefore, in the spring of the 35th year (1946), the hidden communist spies and peripheral student groups of the China Democratic League in various schools in Shanghai jointly formed the "Shanghai Student Organizations Federation" (abbreviated as "Xuetuanlian"), participating in the "Shanghai People's Organizations Joint Petition Movement to Nanjing" on June 23rd of that year. This "Xuetuanlian" organization was the foundation for the development of the communist party's national student union organization in the future. In January of the 36th year (1947), the communist party used the Shen Chong case in Beiping to launch a national anti-American movement, successively organizing inter-school organizations called "XX City Student Union to Protest American Atrocities" throughout the country. Among them, Shanghai, Chongqing, Beiping, and Kunming were the most active. In March of the same year, under the direct instruction of the communist party's "Central Youth Department," communist spies actively instigated and contacted various regional "Anti-Tyranny Alliances" to secretly establish the so-called "National Student Anti-Tyranny Federation" in Shanghai to coincide with the convocation of the Moscow Foreign Ministers Conference. This organization was, in fact, the beginning of the communist party's use of hidden communist spies in government areas to openly conduct national student organizations. The endless student unrest that followed was centered around this large-scale instigation.</p>
<p>After the establishment of the "National Anti-Tyranny Federation," its central task was to strive for the leadership of student self-government associations in major specialized schools and above in various regions, and to actively prepare for the so-called "anti-hunger," "anti-civil war," and "rescue education crisis" May student unrest. On May 20th of that year, professional students in the Beijing, Shanghai, Jiangsu, Hangzhou, and Bian districts instigated the selection of so-called student representatives to march and petition in Beijing, formally directing the so-called "May 20th" incident. At the same time, communist spies unscrupulously spread conspiracies and launched a national "general strike" on June 2nd to test their dominance in the national student camp. Fortunately, with the local security authorities taking various preventive measures and guidance in advance, and with the majority of good students understanding the righteousness, this conspiracy failed to succeed. However, communist spies took this opportunity to convene the "National Student Representative Conference" in Shanghai in mid-June, with representatives from communist spies in various regions participating. During the meeting, it was decided to reorganize the original "National Anti-Tyranny Federation" into the bogus "All-China Students' Federation" (abbreviated as "Zhongguo Xuelian") as the central organization for their long-term instigation of student unrest, inducing young students to participate in the communist rebellion. The original regional "Anti-Tyranny Alliances" were also reorganized into regional bogus "Xuelian" at the same time. Its organizational system can be represented as follows: World Federation of Democratic Youth, Red International Student Union, the bogus Zhongguo Xuelian, under the "Council" are - Shanghai Xuelian "Council Member" and Secretariat - Nanjing Xuelian "Council Member" - North China Xuelian "Council Member" - Zhejiang Xuelian "Council Member" - Jiangsu Xuelian "Council Member" - Wuhan Xuelian "Council Member" - Kunming Xuelian "Council Member" - Henan Xuelian - Northwest Xuelian (preparation began in the spring of the 37th year) - Hong Kong Office (contact with the communist party and the International Communist Party, transmitting orders and leading student groups of overseas Chinese in Southeast Asia). Underneath are the University Federation, Middle School Federation (student self-government associations of various schools controlled by communist professional students, various student groups of communist professional students).</p>
<p>After the establishment of the bogus "Zhongguo Xuelian," in addition to directly receiving orders from the "Central Youth Department" and cooperating with the communist armed rebellion to carry out various conspiratorial activities to disintegrate the government's rear, it also closely linked with the Red "International Student Union," which the Comintern used to incite young people in various countries to betray their motherland, becoming one of the units of this international conspiracy organization. On the 2nd of this month, the bogus "Zhongguo Xuelian," "Democratic Youth League," and the Democratic League's "Youth Work Committee" presumptuously dispatched representatives to India under the name of "Chinese Youth Delegation" to participate in the "World Federation of Democratic Youth Founding Congress" and the "Southeast Asia Democratic Youth Congress" convened by the "International Student Union." After the meeting, Qian Cunsu, sent by the bogus "Xuelian," was stationed in Prague as the Chinese Vice Chairman of the "International Student Union" and the so-called "Minister of Colonial and Semi-Colonial Territories." The "World Federation of Democratic Youth" and the "International Student Union" organizations are not only peripheral organizations for the Comintern to organize communist youth in various countries, but are also directly led by the "Committee of Youth Against Fascism of a Certain Country." The bogus "Zhongguo Xuelian" did not hesitate to openly send representatives to participate and openly accept its leadership, which is sufficient proof that communist spies sold out their country, helped the communist party to be abusive, and carried out a conspiracy to communize all Chinese youth, which is obvious. Furthermore, the fact that the so-called "International Student Union" Secretary Blackman openly came to our country in May of this year via Southeast Asia and Hong Kong to inspect the student movement conducted by the bogus "Zhongguo Xuelian" in the areas of Beiping, Shanghai, Hangzhou, and Nanjing, and was warmly welcomed by professional students everywhere, and that the "International Student Union" openly claimed that it would convene a conference in August of this year to discuss "how to strengthen the Chinese student movement," fully proves the trinity of communist spies, the communist party, and the communist youth international, colluding with each other.

<h3>Moscow Negotiations Still Deadlocked: Three-Nation Envoys Plan to See Stalin Again</h3>
<p>[Reported by This Newspaper] London, 17th Broadcast: A spokesperson for the British Foreign Office stated at a press conference, "I hope that the envoys of the three nations, Britain, America, and France, will meet with Molotov again. Monday's meeting was not the last." According to informed sources, it is speculated that the three-nation envoys will meet with Stalin again in the near future.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 16th] Individuals close to the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs pointed out that the three-nation envoys' audience with Stalin was not intended to bypass Molotov to appeal to a higher authority, but to report the results of their talks with his Foreign Minister. It is reported that both sides have agreed to hold a four-power conference to discuss the principles of the German issue, and the date will be decided in the near future.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, London, 17th] British envoy to the Soviet Union, Roberts, regarding the Moscow negotiations, sent another report to the British Foreign Office this morning. After receiving the notification, Foreign Secretary Bevin and Minister for German Affairs Strullung immediately conferred with the American Ambassador to Britain, Douglas, and the French Ambassador, Massigli. The British Foreign Office expects further negotiations between the three-nation representatives in the Soviet Union and Molotov in the coming days.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, London, 17th] Former Washington diplomatic circles rumored that the three nations, Britain, America, and France, had agreed in principle that if the Soviet Union could lift the Berlin blockade, it would stop forming another West German government. A spokesperson for the British Foreign Office denied this rumor today, saying that the positions of the three nations, Britain, America, and France, have not changed.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Paris, 17th] According to unconfirmed reports, the Western three nations have agreed to consider the possibility of ending the occupation within one year after the signing of the peace treaty under certain conditions.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Paris, 17th] Experts from the Western six nations will hold a meeting in September to formulate the regulations for the international co-management of the Ruhr area. According to a spokesperson for the French Foreign Office, the location of the meeting has not been determined, and the convening of the meeting is based on the provisions of the London Agreement. The announcement of this meeting by the Western countries indicates that they will continue to push forward with the co-management of the Ruhr area regardless of Soviet opposition. Informed sources here stated that the Soviet Union favors temporarily shelving or even abandoning the Ruhr control plan, and the announcement of the meeting's convening comes after six meetings between the envoys of Britain, America, and France and Molotov.</p>
<h3>The Soviet Union Adopts Various Measures to Unilaterally Rule Berlin: The Division of Municipal Institutions Continues to Expand</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, London, 17th] The Times today carried a dispatch from its Berlin correspondent stating: "I learned from a non-partisan individual" that the German administrative authorities in the Soviet occupation zone expect that before September, Berlin will not only be ruled by one nation but also by "one political party alone." The correspondent stated, "According to this individual's opinion, the measures that the Soviet Union is currently taking and other subsequent measures it will take in Berlin are aimed at making people believe that the control of the German capital has already been handed over to the other side." Under these circumstances, the Western powers, who have become guests, could be allowed to continue to station representatives or even troops in Berlin, and they could also be allowed to enjoy certain conveniences in transporting supplies after the resumption of railway traffic.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Berlin, 17th] The Soviet military commander in Berlin, Kotikov, wrote to the mayor of Berlin, Mrs. Schroder, on the 17th, stating that the Berlin Municipal Council's recognition of the non-communist independent trade union as a legitimate collective bargaining institution was an "illegal action." The communist labor bureau chief, Schmidt, had previously threatened to deny the decision of the Municipal Council and split the Berlin Labor Bureau into two. Kotikov's intervention essentially endorsed Schmidt's threat. The Soviet-affiliated newspapers are fiercely opposing the Municipal Council's movement, and Kotikov's letter is adding insult to injury. The police and food bureaus of the Berlin municipal government have already been split into two, and Kotikov's actions have deepened the division.</p>
<h3>Soviet Troops Actively Mobilizing on the Border of the British Occupation Zone</h3>
<p>British Protest Against Soviet Aircraft's Mock Attacks</p>

<p>[Agence France-Presse, Berlin, 16th] Today, two Soviet fighter jets made mock attacks on British transport planes that frequently traveled in the air corridor. Britain has lodged a strong protest with the Soviet Union.</p>
<h3>Clay Declares He Will Not Resign</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Frankfurt, 17th] General Clay, the commander of the American forces stationed in Germany, stated on the 17th that even if the highest authorities in Washington decided to abandon the West German government that he initiated, he would not resign. Clay stated at a press conference, "I have served in the military for 34 years, and I have never failed to execute any order from the government, nor have I ever resigned because I could not execute any order. I will continue to do so now."</p>
<h3>Economic Situation Deteriorates in the Soviet Occupation Zone of Germany</h3>
<p>[Reported by This Newspaper] London, 17th Broadcast from Berlin: The economic situation in the Soviet occupation zone of Germany is deteriorating. It is reported that workers at the Krupp factory have gone on strike in protest of food shortages. Factories and stores in the Soviet occupation zone have been forced to close due to a lack of raw materials and goods. Coal and steel from the Ruhr area have disappeared due to the Western nations' suspension of trains. This is a countermeasure by the Western nations against the Soviet Union's blockade of Berlin.</p>
<h3>Drafting of New Danube River Convention Nearing Completion: British, American, and French Setbacks</h3>
<p>[Reported by This Newspaper] London, 17th Broadcast from Belgrade. The work of drafting a new convention for the Danube River is nearing completion. Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Vyshinsky accused Western nations of attempting to undermine the drafting of the new convention. The three nations Britain, America and France suggested that the new convention needed approval of 11 countries including Austria and the three powers before it could come into effect, but it was rejected by a vote of seven to three. Conversely, the Soviet Union suggested that the new convention could come into effect with the approval of six countries and the conference passed it.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Paris, 17th] A spokesperson for the French Foreign Office announced that the French delegation attending the Danube River Conference would no longer participate in voting with immediate effect, and France might submit the entire matter to the United Nations.</p>

Authorities stated that although he can maintain contact with Washington via telegraph and return to Washington within two days in the event of an emergency, he still believes that staying in Washington and remaining at his post is the best option.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Tokyo, 17th] U.S. military authorities announced on the 17th that U.S. paratroopers are studying "tactical operations" of parachuting onto Japanese northern islands within sight of the Soviet-occupied territories. U.S. military authorities stated that the 187th Glider Infantry Regiment of the 11th Airborne Division is conducting a series of paratrooper jumping exercises in Hokkaido. It is said that the purpose of this is to make paratrooper training realistic and to familiarize personnel with the "tactical operations" of paratroopers. Major Mausude, a training officer with the regiment, said that since April, there have been two to five teams of paratroopers jumping each month, with each team ranging from five to fifty people, depending on the distance and method of the exercise. Hokkaido is only a narrow strait away from the Soviet-occupied Sakhalin Island and the Kuril Islands.</p>

<h3>Reports on Spy Case Under Study by U.S. State Department; Reply to Soviet Protest Forthcoming</h3>
<p>[United States Information Service, Washington, 16th] Regarding the case of Mrs. Kasenkina jumping from the fourth floor of the Soviet Consulate in New York City on August 12th, State Department officials are studying the reports received from the New York Police Department today. According to State Department spokesman McDermott, the notes sent by Soviet Ambassador Panyushkin and Foreign Minister Molotov regarding this case will be answered after detailed study. McDermott said that the State Department is in contact with the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and it is expected that the Bureau's investigators will soon send a report. He also said that the New York Police Department is continuing its investigation, but he cannot reveal the results of their investigation. When asked if the State Department was also conducting an investigation, McDermott said, "No." He emphasized that this action is the responsibility of the judicial authorities, not the State Department.</p>
<h3>Hiss and Chambers Scheduled to Confront Each Other Tomorrow</h3>
<p>Announced by U.S. House Un-American Activities Committee</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Washington, 16th] The House Un-American Activities Committee's plan to bring Hiss and Time magazine editor Chambers together has been postponed until the 19th. Chambers accused Hiss, a former State Department official, of being a member of a pre-war communist underground organization. According to Committee Chairman Thomas, Chambers could not come here from New York on the 16th.</p>
<h3>New York Soviet Consul General Issues Written Statement</h3>
<p>Claims Mrs. Kasenkina's Jump Was Due to U.S. Persecution</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, New York, 16th, Associated Press] Soviet Consul General in New York Lomakin recently stated that Mrs. Kasenkina attempted to commit suicide by jumping to avoid persecution by the U.S. It is said that everything Gao suffered at the hands of anti-communist White Russian "kidnappers," as well as "the defamatory and malicious rumors made by American newspapers and broadcasts, and the threats from American police and courts," greatly disturbed her morale. Lomakin's words are vastly different from what Mrs. Gao told the police, that she was imprisoned in the consulate, so she broke the window and jumped out to avoid being forcibly sent back to the Soviet Union. Furthermore, the Moscow Pravda's statement that Mrs. Gao accidentally fell out of the window does not match Lomakin's words. Lomakin issued a mimeographed statement at a reception for reporters at the Soviet Consulate, answering written questions from reporters. The statement did not directly address these questions, but only listed the Soviet Consul's own explanation.</p>
<h3>U.S. Orders Arrest of "Tokyo Rose"</h3>
<p>Mrs. D'Aquino to Be Escorted to the U.S. for Trial</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 16th] The U.S. Department of Justice has ordered the arrest of "Tokyo Rose" Mrs. D'Aquino on charges of treason. She was born in the United States and currently resides in Tokyo, and is constantly requesting the State Department to issue her a passport so she can return to the United States. D'Aquino is one of the six "Tokyo Roses" who broadcast to American troops, so the War Department has not yet filed charges against her. Although she is married to a Portuguese man, she still retains American citizenship. The Department of Justice has asked the Army to arrest her as soon as possible, escort her back to the United States, and have the grand jury in San Francisco investigate her. The Department of Justice pointed out that Mrs. D'Aquino is the only American among the six, so she can be tried for treason. If found guilty, her maximum punishment will be death, but there must be two witnesses to testify.</p>
<h3>Rangoon Declared Relieved; Overall Situation Still Serious</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Rangoon, 16th] Rangoon is still in the hands of the government forces after the communist rebel army was bombed by the air force. Small-scale railway and inland waterway transportation have been restored with Rangoon. Communication with Rangoon had been cut off since last Wednesday. The encirclement was relieved after the Kachin (transliteration) troops rushed back to Rangoon from the front line.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Rangoon, 17th] An authoritative figure in Burma stated that the situation in Burma is far more serious than generally expected. The government cannot contain the communist rebel army unless it responds with the harshest measures. There are outstanding military talents among the young recruits in the rebel army.</p>
<h3>Israeli Troops Use Deceptive Tactics</h3>
<p>Attack Arab Positions Disguised as Observers</p>
<p>[Associated Press, London, 17th] Exchange Telegraph Agency, Amman, 17th Dispatch: Jewish troops used tanks and artillery to occupy the government building overlooking the Old City of Jerusalem, formerly the residence of British High Commissioner General Cunningham, on the morning of the 17th. The Jewish troops wore United Nations uniforms, infiltrated Arab positions disguised as observers, and then opened fire. The battle then unfolded under the eyes of legitimate United Nations observers.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Cairo, 17th] Al-Ahram newspaper reported that Britain has notified Arab countries that the British government is determined to oppose Israel's allowing the Soviet Union to establish a military base in Palestine.</p>
<h3>President Truman Signs Law Limiting Bank Loans</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 16th] President Truman signed the anti-inflation bill passed by Congress today in a special session.

The President issued a lengthy, thousand-word statement criticizing the legislative branch for passing a law that "fails to fulfill its responsibility to the American people."</p>
<h3>Stalin and Tito's Struggle (Part 1)</h3>
<p>— Translated by the Newspaper Compilation Office (Original article published in the July 9th issue of "U.S. News &amp; World Report" magazine)</p>
<p>Tito's defiance of the Kremlin exposed the real weaknesses of the Soviet system. The world's perception of Moscow ruling a "united empire" was shattered. The friction between the Soviet Union and Yugoslavia was superficial and obvious; the friction between the Soviet Union and other satellite states was latent, and could surface at any time. The US dollars and supplies needed by communist countries could not be provided by the Soviet Union. This may be an unbearable blow to the unity of the Soviet bloc.</p>
<p>(1) Loosening of the Eastern European Bloc</p>
<p>The nascent communist empire began to show cracks. Affected was Yugoslavia, located on the southwestern edge of the communist empire, where a dispute arose between communist leaders in Moscow and communist leaders in Belgrade. Among the heads of communist countries outside the Soviet Union who dared to defy the Kremlin, Yugoslavia's Marshal Tito was the first. He gradually declared his independence from the Kremlin, because among the eight communist countries, only his was neither bordering the Soviet Union, nor occupied by Soviet troops, except for Albania.</p>
<p>Tito rose to prominence through his own efforts during World War II, and has always tightly controlled the Yugoslav army, secret police, and communist party apparatus. Other Eastern European communist countries were led by people appointed by Moscow, mostly gaining power with the help of the Soviet army. They still follow Moscow's instructions, just like the communist parties in France and Italy. However, some countries have gradually become more resistant.</p>
<p>What happened in Yugoslavia is not only of great importance in the territory of the nascent communist empire, but also of vital importance to the United States and other Western countries. The common view that the Eastern European bloc controlled by the Soviet Union is tightly united has been shattered, and another view has emerged, believing that other hidden weaknesses, coupled with Western pressure and US dollars, may break this bloc apart again.</p>
<p>Economic panic is raging throughout Eastern Europe, prompting the Soviet satellite states to consider compromise with Western countries. Industrialization plans are progressing slowly, and the Soviet Union is urgently focused on its own construction, and has no surplus capacity to supply a large amount of machinery. This machinery can be obtained from the West, but Eastern European countries cannot export enough to buy it.</p>
<p>The communist countries, excluded from the Marshall Plan, desperately need US dollars. In order to release the US$50 million worth of Yugoslav gold confiscated by the United States, Marshal Tito was forced to accept the demands made by the US side on Yugoslavia. Other Eastern European countries may soon have to make concessions to the United States for the needs of trade and loans.</p>
<p>Internal resistance in Eastern Europe is gradually softening the "cold war" of the Soviet alliance. One example is that Yugoslav Prime Minister Tito, ignoring Soviet pressure, was unwilling to force Yugoslav farmers to immediately implement a collective farm system. Tito was deeply concerned that the passive resistance of farmers would endanger the food supply. In other Eastern European countries, nationalization plans for small industries and retail businesses have also been shelved for the same reason.</p>
<p>Communist governments are in no danger of being overthrown, because the police, army, trade unions and government agencies are all in their hands. However, communist party members everywhere still only account for a minority. If the Western countries open fire, the satellite armies are of little value. The governments of Eastern European countries are obsequious to Moscow, but cannot win the hearts of the people. On the contrary, Tito's resistance to Moscow has increased his prestige at home. In countries with a long history of anti-Soviet sentiment, such as Poland, Hungary and Romania, underground anti-Moscow sentiment is particularly strong.</p>

<h3>Loud Cannon Sounds Near Zhenru: Armory Explodes, Destroying Houses and Injuring Eight; Mishandling During Transportation Leads to Grenade Falling and Causing Disaster</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] Yesterday, the No. 1 branch of the No. 5 Armory of the Joint Logistics Headquarters near Zhenru in this city, due to mishandling of ammunition, caused an explosion. From 9:50 a.m. to 4:00 p.m., a total of eight people were injured or killed, and more than ten houses were destroyed. Fortunately, the location was remote, and the loss was minimal. In addition to strengthening security and conducting cleanup operations, the authorities have also begun investigating the detailed truth.</p>
<p>The armory is located in Quanzhili, Shenjiajiao, north of Jiaotong Road, about six or seven li from Zhenru. There was a motor vehicle room in the armory, which originally piled up more than 30 tons of abandoned ammunition left by the former Japanese army, including shells, heavy grenades, and hand grenades. Recently, because the armory needed to be repaired and reorganized, the officer in charge, Ou Changsen, a lieutenant, along with squad leader Chen Peng and soldiers Wu Qing, Li Xidi, and Fu Xian, a total of five people, have been moving the ammunition out since the 16th. Yesterday, they continued to work, and at around 9:50 a.m., suddenly, due to mishandling during transportation, a hand grenade fell to the ground. The batch of ammunition had been stored for too long, making it extremely dangerous, so it immediately exploded on the spot. Sparks splattered, extending to other shells. With a loud bang, a major disaster occurred. Ou Yang and the other five people were unable to escape and all died in the line of duty. At that time, shrapnel flew in all directions, with extreme ferocity. Zhang Guozhi, a guard from the 5th squad of the armory guard team, a soldier from a security company, and three nearby residents, Zhao Sanmao and others, were also injured, but their injuries were minor.</p>
<p>Officials Inspect and Strengthen Security</p>
<p>At the time of the accident, the director of the branch armory, Xiong Baozong, had just gone to the Jiangwan general armory to meet with armory director Xu Wenda. After hearing the news, he immediately rushed back. Fire brigades from various districts also rushed to the scene to bravely put out the fire, but because shrapnel was flying everywhere, rescue was difficult. It was not until 4:00 p.m. that the remaining embers were extinguished. During the explosion, Chen Qian, director of the Joint Logistics Shanghai Supply Bureau, Shi Zhensheng, deputy director, Commander Zhou of the port command, and Yan Zi, commander of the 2nd Brigade of the Garrison Command, all arrived at the scene to inspect and strengthen security. Personnel from the Zhenru District Police Bureau were also fully mobilized.</p>
<p>Entire Family of Villagers Affected</p>
<p>According to a post-accident investigation of losses: in addition to the complete destruction of the motor vehicle room in the armory, Building No. 52 of the barracks was also affected, with most of it collapsing. Among the nearby civilian houses that were burned and collapsed, there were a total of five houses belonging to families such as Sun Afu. In addition, a resident, Sun Guigen, because his son was about to get married in October, had recently purchased a large number of furniture, pigs, sheep, etc. This time, they bore the brunt of the disaster, and their entire family was wiped out, resulting in the greatest loss. According to current rough estimates, the ammunition destroyed included more than 20,000 hand grenades, more than 20,000 flares, and about 90 shells. According to authorities, in addition to investigating responsibility for the explosion in accordance with the law, they will also strengthen the inspection and security of other armories to ensure safety. Compensation should be provided to the injured and killed soldiers and civilians, and because the weather is hot, in order to prevent danger from the explosion site, firefighting and security will be conducted simultaneously, and cleanup operations must wait two or three days before they can proceed.</p>
<p>Two People Suspected</p>
<p>Central News Agency Report: According to sources responsible for investigating the cause of the accident, before the explosion of the armory, an unemployed soldier who was lodging in the armory suddenly left, which seemed suspicious, and an investigation is underway.</p>
<p>Another report: At 11:00 a.m. on the day before the explosion (the 16th), a young man was found within the 500-meter security line of the branch armory, wandering for a very long time, seemingly with some intent. He was apprehended by the armory guards. He claimed to be Li Chunxiang, 17 years old, from Yancheng, northern Jiangsu, living in Zhujiawan West, Xiaoxinzhuang, Zhenru Binbei, but did not reveal the reason for wandering. The suspicion factor is very significant.</p>

<h3>Shanghai-Made Glass Silk Stockings: Daily Production of 40 Dozen; Social Affairs Bureau Sends Personnel to Investigate; Disposal Method Undecided</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] Regarding the ban on the sale of imported nylon stockings, Yue Gu Bo Sock Factory, located at No. 3 Caojiazhai, Jiangsu Road in this city, previously submitted a request to the Social Affairs Bureau, requesting permission to sell the domestically produced nylon stockings produced by the factory. Gu Bingyuan, director of the First Division of the Social Affairs Bureau, and Zhang Chude, section chief, went to the factory yesterday morning to conduct an on-site inspection. According to the investigation, the factory owner, Yue Gu Bo, is an Iraqi who registered with the former Ministry of Economic Affairs last year and obtained factory registration certificate No. 12160. The raw materials used by the factory to manufacture glass silk stockings are waste materials purchased from the United States. The Import and Export Management Committee applied for foreign exchange, and the customs also permitted the export of these products. Currently, it produces about 40 dozen pairs of men's glass silk stockings per day. The products are printed with the English words "Made in China" and are sold in Southeast Asia. The factory currently has more than 200 workers, with a base salary of 2.1 yuan per dozen pairs, plus 4 jiao as a severance fee. The workers are all members of the Third District Knitting Industry Trade Union. Once the sales are banned, the workers will inevitably lose their jobs.

He will inquire with the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, the Import and Export Management Committee, and the Customs about Yue Gu Bo Sock Factory's registration and export situation, before deciding on a handling method.</p>

<h3>Large-Scale Dismissals After Physical Examinations; Texaco's Actions Deemed Improper; Labor Union Rightfully Fighting for Employees</h3>
<p>The American-owned Texaco Oil Company recently ordered physical examinations for its employees at Cuihang. As a result, 21 employees in the general accounting and cashier departments were deemed to be in poor health and were summarily dismissed. Among them, some had suffered from lung disease in the past but had now recovered, and the company believed that there was a possibility of recurrence in the future; some had slightly high blood pressure; and one was even dismissed for having athlete's foot. All the employees were outraged upon hearing the news, believing that their jobs were not secure and that the company's actions were clearly inappropriate. The company's industrial union rightfully fought for the employees. After negotiations, the company realized that it was in the wrong and agreed to reinstate four of them, but has not accepted the reinstatement of the remaining seventeen. The union has reported the situation to the Social Affairs Bureau for filing and is still fighting for the employees. In addition, 120 employees at the company's Fuxing Island warehouse recently received orders to undergo physical examinations.

<h3>City Government to Be Responsible for Applying for Loans; Public Utilities Agree to Reduce New Prices; Public Buses and Ferries to Reduce Prices Starting Today</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper News] The issue of price reductions for public utilities in the city was resolved satisfactorily yesterday. All public utilities have decided to reduce the new prices for this month in accordance with the resolution of the City Council. However, the portion of the losses due to the price reduction will be the responsibility of the city government and the City Council, which will apply for loans from the Central Bank. The reduced new prices will be implemented from the date of meter reading, and refunds will be given for payments already made.</p>
<p>The prices of public buses and city ferries operated by the City Public Utilities Bureau will be reduced starting today. The new prices are: City public buses, 100,000 to 280,000 yuan (original price 140,000 to 350,000 yuan). City ferries, across the river ferry, 100,000 yuan (original price 120,000 yuan). Wudao ferry, 68,000 yuan (original price 85,000 yuan). Monthly passes will remain unchanged in price in accordance with Article 9 of the Monthly Pass Regulations.</p>
<p>Trolley Prices to Be Reduced in Two or Three Days</p>
<p>The prices of British and French trolley tickets will be reduced in two or three days because new tickets need to be reprinted. It was found that the City Council's resolution on price reduction stipulates that the 50% increase in the calculation of adjusted prices based on the July cost of living index, metal index, and foreign exchange rate will be cancelled. After this price reduction, the prices of public utilities can be reduced by about 70% to 80% compared to the previously determined prices.</p>
<p>Resolved After Two Consultations</p>
<p>After the major public utilities announced shocking price increases this month, the City Council convened an emergency meeting to take into account the burden on citizens and unanimously resolved to ask them to reduce prices. However, the companies' attitude was firm and they refused. Mayor Wu specially convened a meeting with the persons in charge of the companies the day before yesterday and suggested four solutions to persuade them to reconsider, and they responded yesterday. At 3:00 p.m. yesterday, Mayor Wu again convened a meeting with the City Council, the Public Utilities Bureau, and representatives of the companies. The companies still insisted that they would not reduce prices unless the government subsidized them or there were other solutions to their economic problems. After the city government and the City Council were responsible for guaranteeing the loan, it was finally resolved. However, no deadline has been set for the repayment of the loan, which has almost become a disguised subsidy.</p>
<p>Investigation Committee to Be Established Today</p>
<p>In addition, the Public Utilities Open System Investigation and Review Committee is scheduled to be established today to discuss and review the procedures first. In addition to the five members already nominated by the City Council, namely Jiang Hao, Li Wenjie, Qu Yue, Jiang Haoran, and Shao Yongsheng, one representative each will be assigned by the City Chamber of Commerce, the General Labor Union, the City Industrial Association, the Society of Engineers, the Society of Electrical Engineers, the Certified Public Accountants Association, the City Government, the Social Affairs Bureau, and the Public Utilities Bureau to serve as members.</p>

<h3>Vivid Qinhuangdao</h3>
<p>—Special Correspondent of This Newspaper Han Qingtao</p>
<p>[Airmail from Qinhuangdao, this newspaper, 14th] The KMA built the pier of Qinhuangdao, so the seaside of Qinhuangdao became the world of KMA. KMA is the English abbreviation of Kailuan Mining Administration, and also their logo.</p>
<p>Walking to the seaside area of ​​Qinhuangdao Railway South, there is "Kailuan Road" leading directly to the pier. Next to the flat cement road, there grow clean, green high locust trees and short elm trees. There is also a red cylinder brick road printed with KMA, which adjoins and runs parallel to it.</p>
<p>To the east is the Kailuan Railway. Most of the locomotives on the railway are marked with KMA. There are also electric trams and cars of various sizes with the letters KMA running on the railway and roads. Here, you can also see many Kailuan employees wearing KMA cap badges, active and working.</p>
<p>Walking to the East Mountain, if you look northeast, there is an extremely large coal storage yard, which can store 500,000 to 600,000 tons of coal. Coal from Gu Ye and Tangshan is sent here, and then transported to the south and abroad.</p>
<p>Kailuan's World. At the foot of the East Mountain, there is the Kailuan Hydroelectric Power Plant, which supplies electricity and water to the Kailuan pier, factories, offices, and the residential areas of all Kailuan and Yaohua employees in the south of the railway. Every street and important open space has water taps that residents can open and use at will. North of the Hydroelectric Power Plant, the Kailuan Railway runs vertically and horizontally. Locomotives, freight cars, and electric trams are all parked here. The Kailuan repair factory, in that area with the large yellow letters KMA painted on it and surrounded by walls, emits smoke and steam, and the sound of hammering can be heard.</p>
<p>Land-Sea Connection Station. The Qinhuangdao Customs Wharf is at the southern foot of the East Mountain. There are two large and small, like two legs extending into the sea. The large pier is on the outside. It is a semi-circular steel-concrete embankment. The back of this bow-like pier acts as a breakwater, and the inside of the bowstring is the ship berthing area. The small pier is on the right side of the large pier, inside the harbor, and is a short dike.</p>
<p>The large and small piers together are about 2,700 feet long. The depth of the port ranges from 21 feet to 31 feet. Ships with a draft of 30 feet or less can berth. The large pier can berth five ships, and the small pier can berth two ships. The pier is paved with railway tracks. Trains come and go, loading and unloading goods. Goods from ships at sea are sent by Kailuan locomotives to the Beining Road crossing and pulled onto Beining Road. Goods arriving by train are pulled by Kailuan trucks to the pier at the crossing. The land-sea connection is extremely convenient.</p>
<p>The pier is equipped with tap water pipes to supply fresh water to berthed ships. There is also a cargo warehouse nearby with a capacity of 15,000 tons. The harbor has two dredgers, emitting smoke and the sound of motors, constantly dredging the harbor.</p>
<p>The temperature here, although often below zero in winter, and the sea surface freezes in January and February, does not greatly hinder the navigation and berthing of ships. When the ice is very thick, icebreakers can remove the obstacles caused by the severe cold, so Qinhuangdao has become the non-freezing port of the north.</p>
<p>Today, Qinhuangdao has become a connecting point for north-south land and sea transportation, a water supply line for North China, a support station for the Northeast, and a base for the navy to go north and south. This pier, privately owned by Kailuan, is exerting its great power for the public and for itself.</p>
<p>North-South Two Areas. Beining Road divides Qinhuangdao into two areas, north and south of the railway. The north of the railway is the old city area. West Front Street, West Back Street, Haiyang Road, and the two north-south cross-roads are the concentrated areas of various types of shops. At the same time, these two cross-roads are also the main lines that run through and connect the north and south areas of the railway.</p>
<p>The various goods sold in the large and small stores all come from Tianjin. In addition to stationery and elementary school textbooks, a few bookstores only have five or six kinds of film and drama pictorials published by Tianjin. Other publications from Beijing and Shanghai are not available. The three large and small cinemas show films that have been shown in Beijing and Tianjin for a long time.</p>
<p>"Kailuan," "Yaohua," "Beining Road," and "Hebei Power Branch," etc., have prospered Qinhuangdao. Most of the people directly or indirectly make a living under these two signs. Except for a few special people, it can be said that they depend on each other to survive on this land.</p>
<p>The secluded and beautiful East Mountain has a special charm. The fresh seaside has beautiful scenery. As the sun sets, the men and women watching the tide, the young people bathing in the sea, the little treasures active on the beach, and the old men who come to cool off, all receive considerable satisfaction from nature.</p>

<h3>Hotel Guest in Ningbo Commits Heinous Crime; Swindles Money and Takes a Life</h3>
<p>Shop Assistant of Fang Jiuxia Jewelry Store, Wang Cailie, Dies Tragically from Stabbing</p>
<p>[Report from Ningbo, 17th of this paper] In a city filled with excitement and bustle, violent robberies and murders continue. This morning, a horrifying incident occurred as a traveler swindled money and took a life. A refined young man arrived at the Hongxing Hotel on Binjiang Road in the morning and booked room No. 6 on the third floor. He soon went out to Fang Jiuxia Jewelry Store to buy gold ornaments, where he was served by Wang Cailie. He selected three gold rings weighing a total of one tael and one qian, and the agreed purchase price was over 640 million yuan. The traveler claimed not to have cash and asked the store to send someone with him to Kaiyuanzhuang on the Jiangbei bank to pay. Wang Cailie accompanied him, only to be tricked to the Hongxing Hotel. Around 11:00 a.m., the guest suddenly changed clothes and went downstairs. His behavior was normal. At lunchtime, the waiter became suspicious when he saw two guests enter but only one leave. He rushed upstairs to check and saw a person lying in a pool of blood with fresh blood all over his body. The store owner quickly reported the incident to the police. The body of the deceased was found with over thirty stab wounds, making it unidentifiable. The manager of Fang Jiuxia Jewelry Store, concerned about Wang's long absence, also heard about the bloodshed on Binjiang Road and went to identify the body. It turned out to be his store employee. He immediately wired the district attorney's office to send personnel to examine the body and notify the family for funeral arrangements.

Yesterday, the Criminal Police Team summoned Shao Youfa, a Taoist priest from Ermao Peak, to the hospital for identification. He claimed that Zhu's face resembled the person who had been lingering outside the temple at the time. However, Zhu, who was mentally alert, vehemently denied any involvement in the murder, only claiming that Meiyu had a relationship with Zhang Renzhong.

<h3>Shen Bao Cooperates with Tsinghua Hospital, Renhe Hospital, Baoli Hospital, Red Cross Hospital, Shangxian Maternity and Children's Hospital, and Hui Sheng Obstetrics Hospital; Jinji Car Factory Statement; Truth About the Gaps in the Highway</h3>
<p>In a letter from reader Zhang Baling in your column on August 10, it was stated that because our factory connected to a tap water pipe, it caused the highway to sink into two large gaps. Upon investigation, our factory only installed one tap water pipe, so there is only one gap, and this project was contracted by the Inland Tap Water Company, so it is not our factory's responsibility. The letter also stated that the Shanghai-Minhang South Extension Long-Distance Bus Company sent workmen to fill the gaps with soil, which was prevented by our factory. The highway is not our factory's property, so how could we prevent it? Furthermore, our factory has also sent apprentices to repair the gaps. Recently, the authority responsible for installing the tap water pipe has sent many workers to fill it again to prevent it from sinking further in the future. It can be seen that Mr. Zhang is not clear about the truth of the matter, so we specially request that this letter be published. Shanghai Jinji Car Factory</p>

<h3>Silver Market Loosens, Sentiment Firms Up, Chinese Stocks Surge at Close, Eleven Stocks Including Yongsha and Qinxing Rise to Limit</h3>
<p>Although Chinese stocks rose yesterday, high prices were difficult to sustain. Silver credit has already eased slightly, but measures such as stopping loans to the industrial and commercial sectors and tightening issuance, though far from reality, still cause concern in the fragile stock market. Near the close, off-market stimulation intensified, and rumors spread of large fund injections from the National Bank of China, causing eleven stocks, including Qinxing, to rise to the limit. Yongsha even required a slight premium, creating an ambiguous situation. This was partly encouraged by next-day settlement, making it difficult to confirm the trend.</p>
<p>The morning started firm, with Yongsha opening high at 16,600 yuan, and other stocks also showing gains. After the opening, high-priced transactions by numbers 148, 206, 76, 12, 207, 30, 89, 137, and 218 were frequently settled, gradually trending downward. At noon, it fell as low as 15,950 yuan. After replenishing gains from numbers 69, 190, and 206, the noon closing was 16,050 yuan. Compared to the previous closing, Yong Yong Industry rose to the limit, Sino-French Domestic Underwear was flat, Xingguang, Jingfu, Xinhua, and Li'an experienced slight declines. Yonggong, Zhongni, and Sisheng rose by half a percent, while Zhabei, Xinyi, and Zhongsheng fell by half a percent; the rest experienced slight gains.</p>
<p>In the afternoon market, Yongsha immediately saw 16,700 yuan, but this was still an illusion. Starting from 16,720 yuan, numbers 114, 218, 137, and 160 were sold off, falling to 16,580 yuan. Qinxing reached the limit due to stock swaps and changes in unit relationships. Other stocks only turned bullish after 3 PM. Rongfeng Underwear, Huafeng, Jinglun, Yonggong, Commerce, Zhabei, Hengfeng, and Zhongxing successively rose to the limit. Yongsha was absorbed by numbers 190, 65, 145, and 155, etc. After reaching the limit, there was a slight addition of water. Off-market stimulation intensified, and rumors of large fund injections by the National Bank of China resurfaced, but the National Bank of China was actually injecting funds. After the close, Yongsha reached the limit with sellers. Compared to the morning closing, Yongsha, Qinxing, Rongfeng Underwear, Yonggong, Huafeng, Commerce, Zhabei, and Hengfeng rose to the limit, while other stocks rose by half a percent to one percent. Over-the-counter, unlisted stocks were all bullish, especially Shijie, Zhongguo, Dasheng, and Guanshengyuan, which saw the most dramatic gains.</p>
<p>Government bonds advanced to new highs yesterday due to easing credit. New buyers were eager, and Unified C opened at 210,000, reaching a new high of 238,000. Near noon, it struggled around 230,000. Although rooms 552, 503, 360, and 350 came to sell, it still closed at 228,000. As a result, Unified A, B, C, and E each rose by about 10%, and Unified D also improved by half a percent. Turnover was approximately 5 million.</p>
<h3>Off-Market Commodity Prices Rebound, Rice Market Remains Firm, Special Grade Japonica Reaches High Price of 68 Million</h3>
<p>The rice market rebounded because silver credit eased, off-market commodity prices rose, and sentiment firmed up. Holders tightened their grip on goods, and rice shops also added more, leading to a market rise of 200 to 3 million. North City White Japonica was 62.5 million, up 3.5 million. Yangxian rose 3 million, and Special High Grade Japonica was at 68 million. In the South City, all grades of Japonica and Indica rose 2 million. Jiaxing New Coarse Indica was 45 million, and Pudong New Japonica was 58 million. Yesterday, the total arrivals in the North and South markets were 3,225 stones.</p>
<p>Flour rose rapidly, because silver credit eased, all off-market commodity prices rose, and sentiment was active, with speculative retail investors showing strong interest. Old Che flour rose from 22.5 million to close at 23 million, up 1.5 million. Bingship flour rose 2 million to close at 22.5 million. Hongfeng and Jiancheng each rose 2 million. Bran rose 700,000 to 800,000. Wheat buyers and factories have not reached a price agreement and have not yet opened, with prices at 31 million.</p>
<p>Coarse grains turned firm, due to slightly looser silver credit, the rise in rice prices, and unified sentiment turning firm. Moreover, off-market commodities seemed to be rising, so cargo owners pushed prices hard. Soybeans rose by a million, but actual sales were not smooth. New corn arrivals were plentiful, and the market was flat. Yuanmai Shantou stopped delivering, while the North Gang took slightly, rising 1 to 2 million. Broad beans added a million, while mung beans were very sluggish in sales, lacking the strength to rise. Sesame transactions were very rare, with little price fluctuation. Raw peanuts initially rose 2 million, and continued to rise in the afternoon market, rising a total of 7 to 8 million.</p>
<p>Cooking oil rose sharply, because it had fallen too much the previous day. In addition, all off-market commodities turned firm, and silver credit was not tight, which triggered a buying spree, with retail investors absorbing a lot. Soybean oil initially opened at 155 million, then rose to 158 million, and finally closed high at 162 million, a gain of 16 million. Raw oil transactions were relatively clear, rising slightly by 7 million, with the afternoon market trending firm. Raw vegetable oil closed at 140 million, up about 10%. Small cart sesame oil rose by 10 million. Soybean cake also turned up, with Sipaibing finally rising by 1 million.</p>
<h3>Silver Credit Trends Easing, Banks Have Small Net Inflows</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the silver credit situation in the local market trended toward loosening. Among silver firms and banks, the clearing house saw a net inflow of 670 billion. Specifically, the National Bank of China had a net outflow of 544.4 billion, the Bank of China had a net inflow of 204.6 billion, the Bank of Communications had a net outflow of 101.51 billion, the Farmers Bank of China had a net outflow of 81.83 billion, the China Trust Bureau had a net inflow of 131.83 billion, the Postal Savings Bureau had a net outflow of 27.61 billion, and the Central Cooperative Treasury had a net outflow of 4.04 billion.

<h3>Export Loan for Chinese Tea Set at 6 Million per Dan</h3>
<p>According to the Export Control Commission: In order to promote the export of Chinese tea, the government has decided to provide export tea loans, with the loan amount set at 10 million per dan. Subsequently, due to rising domestic prices and increased procurement costs, a loan of 10 million per dan was not enough for tea merchants to operate. Export tea merchants unanimously requested that the loan per dan be increased to 80 million in national currency. This request has now been resolved by the National Bank of China's Discount and Loan Committee and the Advisory Committee to lend 70% of the requested amount, that is, the export tea loan is increased to 56 million in national currency per dan. It is reported that it is being submitted to the Discount and Loan Committee for consideration. Once approved, the full amount can be lent, which will be of great benefit to the export of Chinese tea in the future.</p>
<p>Also, it is reported: The foreign tea market opened in the morning and was still in a consolidation phase, but later the trend turned slightly better, and the market rebounded again. The reason is that exporters are still interested in black and green tea, while holders are holding firm due to both arrivals and inventory, stubbornly selling at high prices, resulting in progress. As for domestic sales of patterned teas, they followed suit and rose. However, according to people in the industry: At present, most companies are forced by funds, so the rise is quite gradual.</p>
<h3>Chinese Medicine Declines</h3>
<p>Chinese medicine declined slightly yesterday. Recently, due to slight demand from other locations, sentiment was boosted. Grade 1 picked incense, continuing the gains from the previous day, rose another 2 million, closely approaching the 20 million mark. Indian picked supply and demand were balanced. Crude oil fennel called high at 1.7 million, but then fell slightly due to easing domestic demand. Compared to the previous day's closing, it rose 100,000, to 1.5 million. Pangolin scales sales were active, and the price rose 6.5 million. White Dawa was in great demand from other regions, and once rose to 7.5 million, but then stalled because the rise was too great and buyers were unable to act. Finally, due to brokers unloading, it gradually fell to 6.5 million. Xilu Codonopsis was rarely and actively bought, and the price gradually rose, with merchants exchanging with each other. Kuilu was 14 million, Tulu was 12 million, Gonglu was 10 million, and Xisha rice price rose 5.5 million.</p>
<h3>Out-of-town Traders Compete, New Buying Active, Cotton Yarn and Cloth Prices Rise Again, Longzhu Ne Once Breaks 90 Million Mark</h3>
<p>Yesterday's cotton yarn market situation: due to next-day bank clearing surplus, silver credit turned loose, manufacturers had absorption, and traders in Tianjin and Guangdong recovered their procurement activities, coupled with off-market price fluctuations, the market situation suddenly turned buoyant.</p>
<p>For 42s blue phoenix fine yarn, the price of Fangjian brand rose by more than 300 million in the morning, and the asking price also jumped by 300 million. Later, due to more buying and less selling, the market became even more popular, making a high of 3.25 billion on the spot, and 3.33 billion tomorrow, a rebound of 350 million to 30 million compared to the previous day. Other thick and thin yarns also rose by 100-200 million and over ten percent respectively, with 71 lots traded.</p>
<p>Yesterday's cotton cloth market situation: due to a large number of remittances from other locations to Shanghai in the afternoon of the previous day, and even more so because of a large surplus of funds from banking institutions, silver credit tended to loosen. New buying suddenly became active, and traders in out-of-town trading took advantage of the low prices to aggressively enter the market. It was heard that traders in the north were collecting large quantities of goods from off-market, so the opening bid for 12-pound Longzhu fine cloth reached 90 million, without a buyer. Then, a formal transaction was made only after it rose by 10.7 million compared to the afternoon closing of the previous day. Although the market was buoyant, the silver credit within the industry was still tight. There was a lot of floating profit up for sale, and at around 9:50, it retreated slightly by 3.5 million.</p>
<p>After 10:00, because many companies were selling Longzhu at the 80 million level, those who were short covering became active, and traders also came to compete for absorption, the market gradually rose, reaching a high of 91 million, and returned near to 88.2 million, which was a rebound of 11.4 million compared to the previous day.

<p>The woolen fabric trend remained subtly strong yesterday. Prices were firm and rising, sentiment was optimistic, and retail and wholesale transactions seemed more active than last week. This street was filled with floral and gabardine, and buyers mainly needed overcoats and medium-thick serge. In terms of color, dark colors were preferred by buyers. Although light colors frequently fell in price, they were still unpopular. Coffee-colored overcoats, floral fabrics, and Xuanwei were quite popular. American Meriden’s asking price was surprisingly high due to a shortage of inventory and American exchange rates.</p>

<h3>After the Implementation of the Measures for Overseas Chinese Investment, Overseas Remittances in Guangdong and Fujian are Expected to Increase</h3>
<p>[Our newspaper reported] The person in charge of the Preparatory Committee of the Industrial Association had a consultation with Director Huo of the Import and Export Control Commission on the issue of re-production after overseas Chinese capital is imported in the form of raw materials. It is understood that the views of all parties on the issue of how easy it is for raw material imports to become funds are not consistent. The government is deeply concerned about whether this fund will flow into the black market to stimulate the exchange market; what manufacturers are concerned about is how to use this fund to purchase raw materials and participate in re-production. It is heard that the competent authorities will first ask their superiors for instructions for the sake of caution, and then make a decision.</p>
<p>Xu Fengzao, Director of the Xiamen District Office of the Import and Export Management Committee, came to Shanghai a few days ago on official business. According to reports: Xiamen is a concentrated area for overseas remittances. In the past, due to the excessive difference between the exchange rate and the black market, they were all avoided. After the implementation of the exchange settlement certificate method, it still failed to catch up with the black market, and overseas remittances were not enthusiastic. Recently, overseas Chinese are allowed to return to China to invest in production enterprises, and overseas Chinese can bring in goods. Overseas remittances can definitely increase sharply. This office has submitted and approved the permission for overseas Chinese to bring in goods, but the method is simple and the scope is not extensive, and the results are not satisfactory. The measures announced this time are more complete than in the past, and it is believed that overseas remittances will no longer be avoided. In the past, the most permitted imports were from Southeast Asia, the Philippines, and other places. The main materials were rubber, coconut oil, and tropical medicines. In addition, the import quota in this area for the fifth and sixth seasons was a total of more than 160,000 US dollars, while the actual need was more than 300,000 US dollars, a difference of half. The new measures for overseas Chinese investment can make up for it.</p>

<h3>The Passing of American Baseball Legend Babe Ruth from Cancer After Two Years</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Our Newspaper, United Press, New York, 16th] Babe "Babe" Ruth, the American baseball legend, passed away today after battling cancer for over two years. His condition took a sudden turn for the worse. Ruth's condition appeared to improve last weekend, and he was even able to get out of bed. However, the sudden decline was unexpected. At 5:00 PM, Memorial Hospital issued an emergency bulletin stating that Ruth's condition was critical. He passed away at 6:25 PM, with his wife, two daughters, and several friends by his side. Ruth had been in a semi-comatose state before 6:25 PM. His personal physician, Dr. Haisai Martin, was also present but unable to save the baseball legend.</p>
<p>A Brief Biography of Babe Ruth</p>
<p>Babe Ruth passed away at the age of 53, born on February 7, 1894. He was extremely poor in his childhood and even stole bananas from vendors to satisfy his hunger. However, he eventually displayed his talent in baseball, becoming famous as the "Home Run King." He earned a substantial salary of $80,000 a year with the New York Yankees. During his 22 years in the Baseball League, he hit a total of 714 home runs. In 1927, he set a record of 60 home runs in a single season, which remains unbroken to this day. Ruth played for the Red Sox for six years. In 1920, at the age of 26, Ruth's athletic talent was recognized by Colonel Rupert, a liquor magnate, and he began playing for the New York Yankees, eventually becoming a nationally renowned sports figure. At that time, the Yankees were struggling and did not have their own stadium. Rupert, knowing Ruth's immense drawing power, invested $2 million to build Yankee Stadium, the greatest sports palace in America, which was completed in 1923, and it can be said that it was created because of Babe Ruth. This Yankee stadium can accommodate 70,000 spectators, and the American Baseball League, the World Baseball Finals, etc., are all held here. What makes people never forget is the 1932 World Baseball Finals, in Chicago against the Cubs. Ruth took the field and loudly proclaimed that he would hit a home run this time. As the ball came, he swung and hit it squarely, sending it flying towards center field. His accuracy was truly astonishing. After retiring, Ruth's last appearance at the stadium was in 1947, when the National Baseball Field celebrated "Babe Ruth Day." Ruth made his final performance at Yankee Stadium. Ruth's first wife, Helen Woodford, was a waitress at the Landt Cafe in Boston. She met Ruth at the age of 16 when Babe was joining the Red Sox. It was love at first sight, and Helen secretly gave Ruth larger cakes than she gave to other customers to satisfy his hunger. They married in October 1914, but this couple, who had shared hardships, unfortunately divorced after twelve years.</p>

<h3>Our World Games Football Team Defeats Siamese Chinese Team 8-1</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Bangkok, 16th] Our World Games football team arrived here on their way back home. This afternoon, they played their first match against the local Chinese football team. The Siamese Chinese team had gained considerable experience from participating in the 7th National Games in May of this year, and with the addition of Chen Jiawan, a famous defender from Shanghai, and Xia Jiaxiang, a center forward, they were able to put on a wonderful performance this afternoon. Six minutes after the start of the match, the Chinese team scored first. Six minutes later, the World Games team also scored. The World Games team scored a total of five goals in the first half. In the second half, they scored three goals. The final score of the match was 8-1, with the World Games team winning. Rong Qizhao, the leader of the World Games team, stated at the welcome reception hosted by the Chinese Sports Association this afternoon that the main reason for our country's defeat in the World Games is that our athletes are physically weaker, especially in sports where physical contact is unavoidable. He stated that if China cannot train stronger players, China will never be able to defeat European teams in football. Rong also encouraged the Chinese Sports Association to make every possible effort to establish higher health standards among the younger generation of Siamese Chinese.</p>
<h3>World Games Day Two, 100,000 Spectators Focus on the 100-Meter Finals</h3>
<p>— Special Correspondent for Our Newspaper, Zhong Zhen</p>
<p>[Dispatch from Our Newspaper, London] It is the second day of the London Games. The weather in London today is still exceptionally hot. Although it was slightly cooler than the day before after a thunderstorm at noon yesterday, sitting in the uncovered public stands at noon was still an unbearable experience. The crowds heading to Wembley Stadium today did not diminish due to the heat. According to statistics, no less than 100,000 people entered and exited the venue. As for the residents of London, those who had already seen the World Games flocked to the English countryside for vacation, so today, from early morning, 200,000 Londoners went to various train stations to catch trains, making it impossible for the general police officers and station staff to perform their duties. Similarly, the roads were also filled with various vehicles. Such a grand occasion can indeed be called unprecedented in post-war London. Tomorrow is Sunday, and the conference will take a day off, but the busy situation at the various fire stations is expected not to be relaxed in the slightest, because a new batch of spectators will rush from the European continent to compete to see the track and field and ball games finals. This will undoubtedly allow the British treasury to receive another huge amount of foreign exchange.</p>
<p>At the track and field stadium in Wembley, the javelin and high jump preliminaries were held this morning. In the afternoon, there were the 50,000-meter race walk, the women's 100-meter preliminaries, the 400-meter hurdles finals, and the highly anticipated men's 100-meter semi-finals and finals. The men's 100-meter semi-finals began at 2:30 PM. In the first group, American black athletes Dillard and Ewell finished first and second with 10.4 seconds each. British McGoggart finished third with 10.7 seconds. In the second group, American Baden finished first with 10.4 seconds, and Panama's Raby (black) finished second with 10.5 seconds. The third place was also a British athlete, also named Mack (Donald). The fact that Britain had two 100-meter athletes who could participate in the finals was unprecedented in previous World Games. So this news almost drove Londoners crazy, and the names of the two Macks were printed in extra-large lead letters in the evening newspapers that day. The 100-meter finals were held at 3:45 PM. All the spectators in the stands waited with bated breath, hoping for a world record to be broken. As soon as the gun fired, twelve flying legs dashed out in unison. As a result, the champion was still American black athlete Dillard, who tied the Olympic record with 10.3 seconds. He was only 0.1 seconds away from the world record of 10.2 seconds. American black athlete Ewell finished second with 10.4 seconds. Third was Panama's Raby. Fourth was British McGoggart. American Baden and British MacDonald were ranked fifth and sixth respectively. From this, it can be seen that the sprinting ability of black people far exceeds that of white people. America's Coach Lun broke the World Games record in the 400-meter hurdles with 51.1 seconds and won the championship, but it was still far from the world record of 50.6 seconds. There were also wonderful diving performances and the men's 100-meter freestyle finals in the Royal Swimming Pool today. As a result, America's Lees won the championship with 57.3 seconds, setting a new Olympic record, but it was still incomparable to the world record of 55.4 seconds. Second was England's Ford, and third was Hungary. All the results today were not as satisfactory as expected. This may be due to the influence of the weather, but the amazing new records that were hyped up in the newspapers may just be a coincidence.</p>

<h3>Firefly</h3>
<p>— Bai Yong</p>
<p>It's the middle of the lunar month, and the Heavenly River coupling season has passed its peak of prosperity. One can't help but think of Du Sichen's famous line: "The night on the Heavenly Street is as cool as water, I lie and watch the Cowherd and Weaver Girl stars." Although the night is not yet cool, the lingering summer heat is still intense.</p>
<p>Regarding fireflies, I always feel like they are a good subject for a short essay, but unfortunately, I can't think of much else to say. Besides the previous verses, there are still remnants of childhood memories of reciting the "Dongshan" chapter from the Book of Songs in the village: "In the fields and hunting grounds, the fireflies crawl shining. They are not to be feared, but to be cherished." At first, I was just shouting loudly, and it wasn't until I went to middle school that I realized that "xiaoxing" refers to fireflies. Although my home is located near a river, it is not what is called "low-lying, damp land," so "rotten grass," etc., doesn't really "transform into fireflies." Therefore, my childhood impression of fireflies is almost non-existent.</p>
<p>Later, I lived in Beiping, where there were spacious courtyards and old houses. Even "large communal courtyards" had large open spaces for people to enjoy the cool air and watch the stars and moon at night, unlike Nanjing and Shanghai, where people are forced onto the streets or into alleys by courtyards as small as bean curd. In the past, electricity was not very common in Beijing. Underneath small sour jujube trees or crabapple trees, with fragrant jasmine and tuberose placed at night, one would always see that small cluster of faint green light. Children, not knowing any better, sometimes even felt a slight fear, but eventually, it turned into joy, chasing after it and collecting it in small glass bottles to compare the size of the light. Often, at these moments, the little bug's light would automatically go out, causing the children to sigh unhappily.</p>
<p>It is this little bit of light that has won the love of people and even all things. Although fireflies are small, they are indeed great. The Dragon Tree Bodhisattva in the "Great Perfection of Wisdom Sutra" says:</p>
<p>"For example, a firefly can shine a little in the absence of the sun. But when the sun rises, with its thousand rays of light, the moon and all the stars have no light. How much less a firefly!"</p>
<p>Although many people with dull roots cannot understand Buddhist words, this saying is very enlightening. Most people in the world slander the ordinary, thinking that they cannot startle the common people. They don't know that a bowl of porridge and a meal, a thread and a strand, all come from the ordinary. Their greatness cannot be measured compared to heroes fighting and killing thousands. Moreover, this is a spark in the boundless darkness. Ancient legends say that Che Wuzi used it to read books, which is naturally a far-fetched and unbelievable story (Fabre's Book of Insects says: "If you move a firefly over a line of text, you can see individual letters, or even the whole word if it is not too long, in the darkness. But you can't see anything outside this small area. Such light would make the reader lose patience." According to this, studying by firefly light is not easy. If Che Wuzi could do it, he could be called an iron pestle ground into a needle). But you know how anxious one is for a bit of light in the boundless darkness. Zhuangzi's story of drying up the water in the west river to save the fish in the puddles is a joking allegory. If it is compared to waiting for the sun to rise, as said in the Great Perfection of Wisdom Sutra, it really makes people impatient, and it is the same as Che Wuzi's studying by firefly light. The sun shines on all things and has no intention of claiming credit. Fireflies are also like this. We can use them to light our reading, but they can also turn off their lights and ignore us. This meaning is no different from the sun's ability to make the stars and moon dim. So people are the most despicable, measuring everything by utility, and calculating its size, which is truly unbearable.</p>
<p>There is another strange thing that I might as well mention in passing: Fabre discovered that the firefly's food is actually snails that are dozens of times larger than it. It can use an anesthetic to stun the snail and then suck its juices. China originally had the saying of "red birds and white crows," which means fireflies eat mosquitoes, as seen in Xia Xiaozheng, which is nonsense. But unexpectedly, its real food would be even bigger than mosquitoes, which is truly "another oddity." I often say: There is danger in the light. Could it be that fireflies are no exception?</p>
<h3>Longevity Star</h3>
<p>— Ru Shi</p>
<p>The most famous long-lived people in history are: (1) Czarten, lived to 185 years old; (2) Jenkins, lived to 169 years old; (3) Agha, lived to 156 years old; (4) Part, lived to 152 years old. In addition, there are more than 30 people who have been confirmed to have lived to be 100 years old.</p>
<h3>Two Old Men in the Old Capital</h3>
<p>— Zhu An</p>
<p>Recently, there have been two old painters in the old capital who are over eighty years old: Qi Baishi and Huang Binhong. Old Pin (Baishi's style name is Pinsheng, his real name is Huang, meaning taking fields in Weibin. Today, he is indeed old and respected, which has become a premonition.) His residence was purchased with the money he accumulated from selling paintings. He has always been known for his ability to accumulate wealth. It is said that he has more than one property, so his later years are quite good. However, because he is overly cautious, his rooms and boxes are full of locks, which he wears on his body, seeming to reduce his elegance. In fact, he is extremely generous and values ​​friendship. His elegance is in his heart and not in form. Old Bin only lived in Beiping for ten years. During the chaos, he closed his door and did not participate in external affairs, enjoying himself. He is the same as Old Pin, but his spirit seems even stronger. In Old Pin's room, there has never been a single painting or calligraphy hanging, and there is not a single antique on the seat. He has no other hobbies besides painting. Old Bin's room is a small cubicle, so small that it is not enough to turn around, but the books he reads are piled from the ground to the ceiling. The ceiling has collapsed, and he does not mind if the books get wet from the rain. His books are not particular about versions, but there are many specialized and rare ones. He especially likes to collect local literature, research and praise it, sparing no effort. His desk is piled with ancient seals and ancient jade. Although he no longer carves seals himself, he still often has new insights into epigraphy. He likes to write couplets in seal script and give them away casually, without any stinginess. Although there are many people who ask for paintings, every morning he still uses rough paper to copy ancient paintings, entirely for his own enjoyment, without any thought of fame or gain. His material life is extremely simple, but when people from Liulichang bring calligraphy and paintings, as long as they are truly excellent, he does not hesitate to buy them at a high price, which is much higher than the price people pay for his paintings. He uses his spare skills to engage in gardening. On the dusty and eroded bookshelves, you can find the calamus he planted by hand. In the dry and cold climate of the north, this is very difficult to do. Especially next to the low wooden door, there is probably only three feet of space, but he planted a clump of thin bamboo, which truly eliminates the worldly atmosphere. Old Bin has now returned to the south. I wonder who will write about his former residence in Beiping in the sequel to "Old News of Ri Xia."</p>
<h3>After Recovering from Illness, Uncle Fan Gave Up Wine and Now Drinks Again, Two Beautiful Poems, Following the Rhyme</h3>
<p>— Shen Yuzhong</p>
<p>Shi Ran is my friend, I love him but dare not be presumptuous, I spend several mornings and evenings in his building, and I am happy when there is wine; it is difficult to see people clearly, but I examine the world with my heart, When the wine is drunk, the poetry is heroic, and the aura is like thunder and lightning. The words are clear like water, and the reasoning is deep and unfathomable. When the poem is finished, the wine is drunk again, and the thoughts are chaotic and the emotions are more painful. Suddenly sick in the summer, lying down and giving up the cup, Is the body sick, or is the heart sick? This taste can be transferred to me. I spend a long day on the pillow, deleting and cutting the manuscripts myself, Pushing the pillow and getting up to find wine, the figure becomes the host and guest, The lamp flame and the wine wave, look at each other at close range.</p>
<p>After recovering from illness, he can drink again, and the lotus in the pool is for you. Looking back at the past, the days passed like falling into a trap; The world is topsy-turvy, and one thought is clear. When I come to hand the cup in the morning, I can go far away from here. I miss Jian Lake, and the crazy state of He Jian! I was also a former drinker, and my courage has decreased with age, The vicissitudes of life suppress my good feelings, and the hair on my temples can verify this. You are a true hero, and refuse to change your indulgence, Salute to the two vertical strokes, and the afternoon dream falls in the village shop. The wine is old, look again, you must make the monsters fear, Using this to dominate the world, will surely stop the sigh of the people.</p>
<h3>An Unlucky Dream</h3>
<p>— Qi Feng</p>
<p>One afternoon in 1865, as the members of President Lincoln's cabinet walked into the meeting hall to prepare for a meeting, they found the president sitting at the head of the table, his face buried in his hands. In an instant, he raised his head, his face weary and solemn.</p>
<p>"Gentlemen," the president said, "I have an important message to tell you."</p>
<p>"Do you have some bad news? Or did something serious happen?" Several congressmen asked with concern.</p>
<p>"I haven't heard anything, and there's no news," the president said. "But last night I had a dream that I was in a small boat, all alone, without oars or a rudder, on the boundless sea, without any help."</p>
<p>After a moment of silence, the president continued; "During the war, I had several dreams like that, and every time a major battle happened within one or two days after the dream. Gentlemen, maybe tomorrow, maybe in a few hours, you will get important news."</p>
<p>Five hours later, Lincoln was assassinated.</p>
<p>Is this superstition or fate?</p>
<h3>The Story of the Expert's Position</h3>
<p>— Liu Sheng</p>
<p>Everyone knows that the United States is a scientifically developed country. They value science, and you can hear the opinions of experts at any time. Here are some stories about American experts.</p>
<p>Recently, many highway experts in North Dakota were preparing to hold a meeting to review road construction issues. But as a result, most members were unable to attend, so they had to reschedule. The reason why members could not attend the meeting was: the roads were too bad, and after the rain they were all muddy, and cars could not drive.</p>
<p>A young patient came to a hospital in New Jersey. He was only nineteen months old when he swallowed a safety pin, which stuck in his throat. Several specialist doctors at the hospital took an X-ray of him and told his parents that to save the child's life, surgery was necessary - but the surgery was also quite dangerous. Just as the parents were hesitating, the little boy suddenly sneezed, and with a "achoo" sound, the safety pin "sprayed" out.</p>
<p>In Springfield, Ohio, there is a person who drives very cautiously and has never caused an accident or violated traffic rules for many years. In order to commend him, the authorities specially presented him with a medal. Overjoyed, the man invited many friends to a banquet to celebrate. After the banquet, the award-winning gentleman was stopped by a traffic policeman halfway home - his car was driving crookedly, because he was already drunk. "Drunk driving" just happened to violate traffic regulations.</p>
<p>In Salt Lake City, Utah, many construction experts held a meeting to discuss ways to prevent fires. They went on a tour together to see which houses in the city were dangerous. As a result, they found the house with the worst fire prevention equipment - the local central fire station. In a school in Chicago, one day the teachers were teaching first aid methods. Unexpectedly, the teacher suddenly fainted while teaching artificial respiration, and the students immediately used what they had learned to give artificial respiration to their teacher, which finally saved him.</p>
<h3>A Discussion of Meditation Experiences (Part 1)</h3>
<p>— Jiang Wenyu</p>
<p>From the end of April in the 35th year of the Republic of China (1946) to the middle of August this year (the 37th year of the Republic of China, 1948), I have been practicing the "Yinshizi Meditation Method" for exactly twenty-seven months, without interruption for a single day. Now I am willing to create a report, very faithfully and objectively, about my actual experience of these twenty-seven months, and tell it to the world. Why did I want to learn the meditation method?</p>
<p>My body was relatively strong. Before middle age, I could endure hardship in reading, writing, and working. Even if the work was a little heavier or the sleep was a little less, I would not feel very tired. Unexpectedly, after the age of fifty, I suddenly discovered that I had high blood pressure. Sometimes my blood pressure was as high as 190 degrees or more. Although I received injections and took medicine, there was no reduction. During the War of Resistance against Japan, I moved from western Shanghai to Sichuan, running around to various places, and my work did not stop. In the early winter of the 29th year of the Republic of China (1940), I suffered a major hemorrhage. After the bleeding stopped, my blood pressure remained high, sometimes reaching over 200 degrees. As a result, my body became increasingly thin, and I could no longer do any work that required the use of my brain. At that time, I was already sixty years old. In the spring of the 35th year of the Republic of China (1946), I returned from Chongqing to my residence in Shanghai, thinking, now that I have arrived in Shanghai, personnel affairs are complicated, and things cannot be left undone, what should I do? I happened to be employed at the Hongying Library, and Mr. Jiang Zhuzhuang was in charge of the library. I assisted him. Mr. Zhu persuaded me to learn the meditation method, saying, "If you meditate for a long time, it will definitely cure your illness." I had already read one volume of Mr. Zhu's book "Yinshizi Meditation Method" more than twenty years ago. At that time, I even meditated occasionally, so now I read it in detail again and decided to give it a try. Thus, I formally began on April 27th of the 35th year of the Republic of China (1946).</p>
<p>At the beginning of learning meditation, I immediately determined two aspirations.</p>
<p>I deeply believe that this meditation method can strengthen the body and is sufficient to cure my high blood pressure. I also deeply learned from the past mistake of meditating occasionally. Therefore, I set two aspirations in advance: One is "determination," believing that if I do not learn meditation, then so be it, but once I learn it, I must deeply believe in the effectiveness of this method, and never doubt it, and never fear difficulties. The other is "perseverance," believing that once I have made the determination to meditate, I must persevere, and no matter how difficult or busy I am, I will never let it be interrupted for a single day. After these two aspirations were determined, I began to implement them. In the first few months after implementation, I encountered quite a few obstacles and difficulties, but I always adhered to the determination to persist to the end, regarding it as the same as eating and sleeping, thinking that if I lacked it, I would not be able to complete my life. Therefore, in the past twenty-seven months, there has not been a single day of interruption. At this time, I can boldly say that not only have I not interrupted it for more than two years, but from now on, I will not interrupt it for a single day, and now that I have entered the state of practice, I am even more "unable to stop."</p>
<p>The meditation methods and techniques I use are all based on what is said in Mr. Zhu's book, and sometimes I have also received oral instructions from him. When meditating, I sit in a single lotus position (because I am older, I cannot sit in a double lotus position), my waist is straight, my eyes are slightly closed, and my right hand holds the back of my left hand, placed on my calf (but sometimes both hands can also be placed on my knees). I perform deep and slow breathing, contracting my abdomen when inhaling and protruding my abdomen when exhaling, so that the diaphragm moves; at the same time, my brain is quiet, striving to prevent stray thoughts from arising, and concentrating on the abdomen. Each meditation session lasts about one hour, or fifty minutes. When the weather is cold in winter, I perform it at night before going to bed. In the other three seasons, I perform it in the morning after getting up. I do it once a day as a regular practice. (Sometimes I also do it twice.) One inhalation and one exhalation is one unit, and I usually silently count the breaths, one, two, three, four, five..., up to one hundred times as a group. Using a natural attitude and effort, I gradually extend the breathing time. When sitting, I sit on the bed, sometimes padding with soft objects to make my buttocks slightly higher and my knees lower, so that my upper body leans slightly forward.</p>
<p>(But it doesn't matter if you don't pad with soft objects.)</p>
