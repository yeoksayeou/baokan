<h3>動乎止乎統一割乎</h3>
<p>平津冀參議會三議長和商會工業協會代表請願團，一行五人，前日飛蒞上海，先與中央銀行總裁有所商洽，昨午出席本市新聞界宴會，詳述華北經濟危機，呼籲報人注意，並於昨晚搭車進京，將向中樞剴切陳詞，希望把整個北方民眾的沉重呼聲，傳達到中央執政諸公的耳鼓。由於他們一行懷著迫切的期待，和最近一個月來上海工商各業斷斷續續的呼籲，人們大概都可感覺到經濟危機的日益嚴重，不禁引起了大家心頭久已悶著的一個大問題：究竟目前政府的經濟政策是動乎？統一乎？割裂乎？</p>
<p>北方請願團所列舉的十個例證和所希望的七項辦法，如（一）獎勵出口，（二）開放申匯，（三）恢復生產貸款，（四）洽購美棉美麥，（五）增加糧棉生產，（六）實行以煤易糧等等，實在不僅是北方民眾生計有關的大事，而是整個國家的國計民生所繫的大事。這些辦法能否採行，以及目前那些人為的阻碍能否解除，就是今後國民經濟能否轉危為安的關鍵所在。所以北方請願團此番入京請願之成功與失敗，我們不應視為北方局部之事，而是有關戡亂全局之事。我們幾乎可以說，此番北方請願團之一行，就是中區今後是否酌量採納民意改變經濟政策的試金石。質言之，我們所要求的應該是「動」的經濟政策，而不是「止」的經濟政策，應該是「統一」的經濟政策，而不是「割裂」的經濟政策。由前之道是國民經濟的生路：由後之道是國民經濟的死路！</p>
<p>停止生產貸款，停止工業貸款，停止匯兌，停止鹽貸，限制北煤南運，限制南糧北運，停止河北農地的開墾，减少糧棉的生產，這些北方請願團所列舉的例證，都是說明目前政策所走的是「止」，是「割裂」。可是我們國家所急切要求的是「動員」，是「總動員」，是「統一」，是「大統一」；要動而反令其止，要統一而反促其割裂，眞所謂南轅北轍，天下之怪事無有過於此者。</p>
<p>我們早就說過，共匪用盡一切手段以求達其破壞之目的。惟有破壞農村而使農民不能生產，物資陰天其流通，以陷於割裂之局，然後共匪可以驅策一切無衣無食失業失所的游民，為其危害國家殘戕民族的工具。我們為救國救民之故，自當動員一切人力物力財力以勦匪，以戡亂，對症發藥，祇有以建設尅制其破壞，以生產尅制其毀滅，以統一尅制其割裂，以動員尅制其阻止。必如此，我們纔能團結愛國民眾的全力，以打擊此歷史上空前的國賊。因之，當前解救經濟危機的總樞紐，祇有從（一）增加生產，（二）流通物資，（三）保障職業，（四）安定社會四點入手，政府一切措施，一切辦法，合乎這四大原則的，纔是人民所希望的「動」的政策與「統一」的政策。反之，假使主持大計的人，在經濟政策上目光如豆，祇年檢小算盤，祇打局部的算盤，祇打一時的算盤，不懂如何發動民力，使用民力，以為用些「停止」什麼「限制」什麼的手段，就可以解除經濟的危機，將必後悔無及！</p>
<p>我們願乘北方請願團入京的機會，不避忠言逆耳之誚，向主持經濟政策的大員們貢獻幾點粗淺之見：（一）經濟能穩定，而後政治上；政治上軌道，而後軍事有威力。（二）如失東北，將無華北；如失華北，將無華中。（三）經濟如人體血脈，四通八達，時刻流轉，牽一髮而動全身，決無可以人為力量强為阻遏之理；血脈一旦停滯，勢必枯竭，經濟長此「斷流」，恐將自釀崩潰。我們要大聲疾呼，目前的經濟現象。偏枯極了，也危險極了！北方與南方偏枯，鄉村與都市偏枯，平民與豪富偏枯！積種種偏枯之所至，或聽其演變則經濟前途將有不堪設想者！挽救之道是什麼？就是；</p>
<p>改變「止」的經濟政策為「動」的經濟政策！</p>
<p>改變「割裂」的經濟政策為「統一」的經濟政策！</p>
<h3>袁良在物價委會招告　花紗布最近情况　檢討過去得失闡釋管制政策</h3>
<p>〔本報南京十六日電〕花紗布管理委會主委袁良，十六日晨九時出席全經會物價委會第八次會議時，就花紗布最近情况提出詳細報告。袁氏首述因共匪肆擾，交通未復，供需失衡，物價高漲，中央以是決將重要物資實施管制，以謀穩定金融，適應戡亂需要。最近花紗布管理辦法即為重要。最近花紗布管理辦法即為重要決策之一。袁氏之報告，共分三部份。</p>
<p>一年來之上漲趨勢</p>
<p>（一）一年來花紗布價格上漲之趨勢；花紗布三者上漲速率頗不平衡，以卅六年一月為基期（一百）至十二月止棉花為二·〇一一棉紗為一·三〇〇，棉布為一一棉紗為一·三〇〇，棉布為一一三四，棉花上漲速率，一年中為二十倍以上，遠高於一般物價，幾與金鈔黑市上漲速率接近。棉花上漲率特快，原因為（甲）國棉不敷供給，三十六年棉產估計有一·〇七三萬市担，但手工紡織及民間被絮留用之棉，年需四五〇萬市担，全國紗錠年需棉一千萬市担以上，故用棉不足五五〇至六〇〇萬市担；（已）運輸困難，戰區產棉因交通阻撓，運輸困難，故原可供應紗廠棉花，尚須打一折扣；（丙）外棉進口减少，卅五年外棉輸入計聯總一二六萬四千市担，進口五六二萬七千市担，共六八九萬一千市担，卅六年聯總輸入一四〇萬一千市担，但外棉進口限額八千萬美元，約可進口外棉二百萬市担，合計三四〇萬一千市担，不及卅五年輸入之半數；（丁）產區各方搶購，去年棉花上市，各方紛紛至交通比較使得區域搶購，政府未事先管理，致棉價飛漲，刺激紗布上漲。</p>
<p>過去調節政策檢討</p>
<p>（二）過去調節政策之檢討：過去紡調會僅側重棉紗，對花紗布三者未全面管制，故不能收效；過去調節政策，不外兩端；（甲）機動議價，因市價變動太猛，議價左右為難，如距市價太低，生產不敷成本，如　隨市價，又有刺激物價之議。（乙）隨市拋鈔，此種政策，因政府物資有限，無法大量拋售，僅征收效於一時，難於持久，自去年十一月廿八日至本月七日，拋紗量達一三·二四九件，為數相當可觀，但非根本之道。</p>
<p>今後管制　力求合理</p>
<p>（三）今後管制之實施：今後花紗布全面管制在於管理之中寓有維護扶植之意，各　實施方案力求合理，此項實施細則已議定，正　　中。管理要旨在使產製運銷整個過程獲得適當配合，使囤積投機者無所施其技，以後縱再漲，亦可漲得合理，自棉農至紡織工廠，除生產成本外，仍保持其合法利潤，對正當棉商，仍設法維持其地位，政府一面管理，一面輔助，令我民族資本積累之紡織工業，進入繁榮發展之路。今後管制辦法，為（甲）統購棉花，委托紡建公司及有組織棉商代為收購，價格依照當地成本品質及運繳情形，由管委會決定標準價格，隨時調整；（乙）代紡代織，規定以花紡紗，以紗織布之實物換算標準，凡合規定之紗廠（三千錠以上），布廠（三十台以上），均可代紡代織，工繳計算標準頗具彈性，成品全部由管委會掌握；（丙）紗布合理配銷，過去紗布供需數量不能平衡，致成為投機對象，今後由政府控制全部物資，合理分配，大部棉紗除交由布廠代織外，餘均配銷於登記合格之複製工廠及其同業團體，紗商布商及染廠紗布配銷，擬採報價方式，由用戶自報願出價格及願購數量，申請配售，由管委會核定合理配價，分別配售，使今後紗布供需可得適當調節，而無脫節之虞。</p>
<p>生產配銷　考慮周詳</p>
<p>袁氏之結論稱：管委會今後對原棉如何充分供應，棉價如何穩定，紗布生產如何擴充，配銷如何合理，均已統籌兼顧，考慮周詳，務期此民族工業作正常發展，國計民生得切實保障，中央之戰時經濟措施，亦得以實行有效。另據袁氏談：以花紡紗換管標準為棉花七一二磅半，易紗一件，其中四五三磅給棉花，餘二五九磅折合法幣付給，工價則按指數計算，以紗織布抽象管標準，過去為布廿四匹至廿八匹，換紗一件，工繳在內，現仍照常實行。</p>
<h3>我允許敎會專機　飛往老河口撤敎士　聖保羅號自鄭飛滬</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕基督敎信義會昨日正式宣佈：中國空軍當避現已允許敎會專機聖保羅號得降落老河口軍用機塲一次，運出該地約四十名之美籍及挪威籍之敎士。自三敎士在鄂北被其匪殺害後，信義會已一再向我國空軍當局交涉，希望聖保羅號能至老河口担任撤退工作，該區軍情甚緊，戰事正在城東北二十五哩處激烈進行中。</p>

<h3>中央所屬機關　工人發新辦法　分技工工友兩部份</h3>
<p>〔本報南京十六日電〕茲悉政院所決定對中央各機關工人發薪之辦法，約為分技工及工友兩部份，技工以廿元至六十元之底薪為標準，工友以六元至十八元之底薪標準。政院通過之改善公敎人員待遇辦法中，生活補助費逐月遞减辦法，即係規定機關應行裁員，各機關在扣薪後不增　　費。其有不足者，即以　員辦法彌補之。</p>

<h3>東北生產銳减物價高漲　孰令致之？　共匪侵擾下民生益凋敝</h3>
<p>〔聯合社瀋陽十五日電〕共匪數次進攻已使東北國軍控制區域之農地，减至總面積百分之五，一般工業水準亦降至新低度，通車之鐵路里數，所剩無多，電力與煤產極度减少，並造成各種必需品之缺乏。兩個半月以來，東北進出口實際上已完全停頓。以前主要進口爲棉花·布疋·麵粉·棉紗與香烟，目前美國香烟每包售法幣十六萬元，縱使共軍停止襲擊平瀋鐵路，修理工程至少亦須兩個月。僅產煤區撫順與本溪仍有鐵路與瀋陽聯絡。撫順機工因所入不中產一飽，精神不振，該地工程師每月收入僅合美金十五元，工人收入當然更低。電力之缺乏，使紗廠生產銳减，國軍控制區域僅有二萬五千錠開工。電力與原料缺乏，使紙張·水泥及其他較小工業停止活動。去年十二月之物價指數，與十年前相較，糧食爲二二·二二二倍，衣服二一·三四三倍，房租四·一六七倍，燃料二四·二六〇倍。目前五萬五千元，麵粉七萬元，糖十萬元。土布每匹卅二萬元，煤每噸五百卅萬元。</p>

<h3>重到荷蘭</h3>
<p>— 本報特派員　毛樹清</p>
<p>（本報海牙航訊）戰爭以前，西歐海岸上，有一對和平康樂的姊妹國家，一個是比利時，另一個便是荷蘭。經過六年的　火沖洗以後，比利時不僅恢復了戰前的繁榮，而且因為擁有龐大的非洲「剛果」殖民地，大量的「鈾」礦產生，如今成爲全世界出來美國以外，第二個富裕的國家。荷蘭人今天　起比利時，常常從心坎裏表示羡慕，同樣的，他們也從心坎裏感到悲哀！</p>
<p>東印度糾紛是戰後荷蘭的致命打擊，「十萬大軍」如今坐困在爪哇和蘇門答臘，戰爭的狀態一天繼續存在，過去殖民地的原料供給，以及工業品市場，一天不能恢復。據海牙方面的非官方估計：荷蘭政府每天爲印尼戰爭之初的軍姿，稅收的苛　，物資的短絀，運輸量的減低，都足以加深今天荷蘭困窘的局面。現任首相，天主教黨的比爾博士，曾經在荷蘭國會下議院表示過：祗要印尼問題能夠「刀快頭光」的解決，不管解決的條件，包括任何代價，對荷蘭現狀的改良，總是好的！因此，比爾博士上台不多久，便匆匆的拼着老命飛東印度去了！</p>
<p>我是去年聖誕節前五天從巴黎到達海牙的，正式比爾首相飛離荷蘭不久，荷蘭外交部的新聞處長穆耳先生，匯給了我一份首相啓程以前的當面談話，大意是說：荷蘭政府決心貫澈印尼糾紛的合理解決，使東印度的情況不致再惡化下去，「但如果印尼共和國政府一味盲動，則荷蘭政府當不惜一切犧牲，爲爭取正義與秩序而戰」。那時候，海牙官方確有很多人相信：現政府將會採取更強硬的政策，但也有若干荷蘭朋友告訴我：荷蘭的地位不能再繼續「打」下去，荷蘭之重視東印度，經濟性重於政治性，祗要荷蘭政府在印尼繼續保持經濟的特殊權益，荷蘭政府在政治上再作更大的讓步，是在所不計的。</p>
<p>兩者的意見，我同情後者。因為我自信，我相當的了解荷蘭人的性格。兩年零五個月以前，納粹德國投降以後不久，我曾經到過荷蘭。那時候，距離解放還不多久，一切全是亂糟糟的，但荷蘭人的興奮與狂歡，却遠在法國人和比利時人之上。我那時還是「戰地記者」，住在荷蘭第四大城「烏得勒支」的加拿大軍總司令部內，每天和許多荷蘭人接觸見面和談話，從他們普遍會講的通俗英語裏，我知道，荷蘭人常常流露一種過分的「自尊心」，用中國的　語來說，荷蘭人常常過分的「要面子」。甚至有時候，會使一個最愛面子的中國人，為之驚訝不置。</p>
<p>其他各國的歐洲人，稱荷蘭人為「冷酷的民族」，我記得兩年多以前，在海牙僑領張國樞先生的寓邸，遇見過一位自　為「中國通」的東方語文　學者，他說，荷蘭人被稱為「歐洲的中國人」，荷蘭人的哲學，根中國相像。他還把生長在荷蘭的大哲學家斯賓挪莎，强比作中國的孔子。這次來，我沒有和張國樞談到這個人，但我對荷蘭人的印象，仍然和兩年多以前一樣。荷蘭人沒有像國人那樣嚴肅和冷酷，但是有很多地方，他們是確乎處處在學習著英國人。</p>
<p>英語在荷蘭，幾乎跟荷蘭的國語一樣普遍，實際上德語和荷蘭語相差得很　，　講的國語，但我們在非不得已時，僅量用英語。德國打敗了，在荷蘭講德語，多多少少是一件被認為「不體面」的事。有位朋友告訴我，在荷蘭國歌裏，有一句呌做：「我們引以為榮，因為我們有日耳曼民族的血」，但荷蘭人絕口不願提及此事，我知道：跟一個愛面子人，剝他的「痛瘡」，是一件不禮貌的舉動。</p>
<p>但是，無論如何，荷蘭還畢竟是一個「文物之邦」，居住在這個九百多萬人的小國裏，處處有一種雍容和藹的感覺。蔣鼎文將軍大年夜到荷蘭，對海牙接到的乾淨清潔，讚不絕口。冬天，溫度徘徊在冰點上下，但荷蘭遍地看得見奇花秀葩。血紅的玫瑰，鮮豔的牡丹，乃至於各種各樣的梅蘭菊竹，很多荷蘭人對他們的「花花世界」，常常自傲，然而我以為他們更可驕傲的，還不止此。</p>
<p>中國歷史上「精術填海」的故事，在荷蘭算是十足兌現了的，荷蘭工程師對海水的控制，沒有一國人能够比擬。荷蘭經濟部內，至今還掛着歷史性德地圖，古羅馬帝國時代，荷蘭全是低　湖泊地帶，如今地理上得荷蘭，是從十六十七世紀開始，逐漸填築起來的。英文重大額「尼柔蘭」便是低地潮濕地的意思。一直到現在，荷蘭還有百分之四十的土地，低於漲潮時候的海面。其中百分之二十五土地，是絕對低於海面的。</p>
<p>但看這一方面，荷蘭人「征服自然」的功業，是值得大　特書的。他們不僅在低地　築了堤岸，而且還填平了「須德海」的好幾座角落。一九二五年十二月二十八日，荷蘭工程師完成了「須德海」诲口的長堤，封鎖了北海的浪潮，接着，「威靈根美」的填海工作完成，從前碧波漣漪的滄海，變成了錦繡田園。</p>
<p>一九四五廿荷蘭解放前十七天，四月十七日的清晨，德軍駐荷蘭的總司令部，命令「威靈根美」的荷蘭居民，迅速遷移，接著正午十二點十五分鐘，大堤裂口，潮水洶湧的滾入，那次空前的大浩劫，是荷蘭歷史上破天荒的一次，損失的人畜牛羊，無法計算。荷蘭人今天講起德國軍隊，至今仍咬牙切齒，正和我們回想起日本强盜在民國二十七年黃河決堤一樣。但是荷蘭人的精神還是可敬佩的。納粹敗亡以後的第三天，荷蘭的修堤工程立即開始，僅僅祗有三個月的工夫，合攏工程算是全部完成。</p>
<p>外交部新聞處的濮希先生，和我講了很多「治水」的故事，他說荷蘭政府，現在正計劃填平「須德海」的西南部，使現有須德海地面積，减少一半，如今這一計劉一旦實現，則全國至少可以增加五十萬英畝的可耕地，荷蘭的名貴的農產品，預計還可以增加一倍以上。</p>
<p>兩年多以前，我來到荷蘭的時候，因為祗是怱怱經過，沒有去堤岸參觀，這回隨時隆冬，但仍舊着風雨，去須德海的西北岸跑了一趟，我的簡單的印象，使我聯想起美國田納西州的TVA水利工程，TVA是在高原叢山中防洪水冲瀉，須德海地水利工程，却是防海水倒灌，兩者的結構和建造雖然完全殊途，但對於治水這一點上，都和中國有著切身的關聯。</p>
<p>如今，全世界有不少國家，派遣留學生在這兒習水利工程，聽說：也有兩名中國學生去年剛派送到海牙來，可惜我因為時間太怱促，沒有參觀他們以水利著稱的荷蘭國立工業大學。（一月七日，海牙德查　飯店）</p>

<h3>華北代表團應報業邀宴　陳述晉京請願目的　切盼中央從速扶助工業增產　疏暢糧煤流通恢復生產貸欵</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕華北請願代表團河北省臨時參議會長劉瑤章，北平市參議會議長許惠東，天津市參議會議長時子周，及工商界代表李燭　·姬奠川等一行五人，於十四日抵滬後，曾分別拜訪吳市長張總裁有所商談。原定於十五日晚乘車晉京，嗣　因事延至十六日晚始成行。渠等在京將分別晉謁蔣主席張院長及有關各部會首長，就北方危機提出報告，請求迅速設法解救。</p>
<p>劉瑤章議長等十六日午應益世報劉益之·大公報曹谷冰二君之邀，出席新聞界宴會，常於席上發表晋京請願目的，並詳述北方遭受之苦難，籲請上海報界協助，共向中樞陳述重視華北。劉議長致詞畢，當由本報社長潘公展。東南日報社長期健中，大公報總主　王芸生等先後致詞，一致促請政府注意華北之經濟危機，早日設法解決。</p>
<p>劉議長指出黃河流域與長江流域之人民，係息息相關者。現北方鬧糧荒，而上海正感缺煤。由此可見關係之密切。今後北煤南運，南糧北運，應如何加強辦理，實為急要課題。華北局勢之嚴重，經濟甚於政治，政治又甚於軍事，而三者互為因果。此番代表團代表北方數千萬同胞晉亦請願，主要亦即在經濟方面，希望中央從連扶助工業農業增產，疏暢糧源，流通貨幣。中央對此，當然相當關切，可惜事實上還有些精神貫注不到的地方，所以特地南來，向中央詳細陳述，備供採擇。以下簡單舉幾個例證。</p>
<h3>出口貨堆積腐壞　礦工器材無法補充</h3>
<p>天津出口約佔全國總額百分之十二，但進口外匯分配不及百分之四。其結果，一方面是出口生貨堆積腐壞，一方面是各廠礦工業器材無法補充。　天津對上海向來入超，因此申匯停止以後，立即發生兩種現象：一，匯率高漲，刺激物價。二，現鈔携運進口，資金南流。　資金不斷南流，去年八月問據聞多至八千億。（包括由平津以外轉流的）。因此平津經常周轉不過三四千億，北平不足千億，尙不如上海之一家銀號，貧血症日益加車。　生產貸款停放後，華新恒源北洋各紗廠已經减工裁員，壽豐麵粉廠三廠，只有一廠開工。中小工廠如造胰工業，天津五十四家，開工的只有二十三家。榨油工業幾乎全部停工。染廠五十四家，開工產量不到五分之一。眼看舊歷年關不但原料無法採購，薪工費用也不能支付。　長蘆鹽產，急需政府貸給晒費，否則不惟增產計劃落空，產量恐要銳减。　京滬一帶需用開　烟煤甚切，但開　出售每噸只一百〇八萬元，上海售價達七八百萬元，相差如此之鉅，似欠合理。</p>
<p>米麵昂貴</p>
<p>上海麵粉每袋售價約六十萬元，平津已售到一百二十萬元，因爲每袋還須繳訐可蹬費用十五萬元，另匯水十五萬元，再加運費等項。米，平津每斤高價售至一萬六千元，比上海貴二三倍。　一般糧食，因爲許可，轉口，限額種種限制，商人裏足不前，官家辦事效率稍差，名義上運了多少北上，實際每每不能爭取時問。或天津人口數字，與上海出口數字不盡相符。戰前由滬運津麵粉每月約二百萬袋，河北及東北西北雜　在外。最近平津人口不下三百五十萬，超過戰前，雜糧來源幾於斷絕，每月由滬運津麵粉即使達到四十五萬袋，也距離需要甚遠。</p>
<p>農田荒蕪·棉產不足</p>
<p>日本在　北已經開墾的農地，至少尙有二三十萬畝（不盡在匪區）荒着，而河北平津的食糧，以去年計，至少有二分之一需要由長江流域運濟。可是農林部五年糧食增產計劃巾，第一二年全未將河北列入。河北產棉區目前保有者不過二分之一，而去年產棉尙不足供河北平津紡織工廠需要量二分之一。三個月後如無外棉運到，即不能維持生產。但今年棉貸尙在未定中。　去年河北田賦，照四十七縣市征收三十三萬石，迄今十三縣市相繼失守，征收總額不及二分之一，多由保安團隊及自衛團食用，無法再撥交軍糧。至於收購價格僅約當市價八分之一，困難更多。</p>
<p>爲解決以上各種問題計，懇切希望中央考慮以下各種辦法：　獎勵出口，試行聯鎖制度，至少輸入限額佔全國總額百分之二十，採購生產器材，請准結遠期外匯。　開放申匯。　恢復生產貸款，變通押匯方法。　請速向美國洽購　麥趕運來華。　維持鹽貸，增加鹽產。　解除南糧北運限制，實行以煤易糧。　增加糧棉生產，從寬貸款。</p>
<h3>美總領招待記者　第一課學習國語　願為復興正常貿易努力</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕美新任駐滬總領車卡勃脫，於前農偕夫人及女公子抵滬，昨日上午十一時半在其建設大樓辦公室內舉行非正式記者招待會，向本市各報社記者發表談話，下午二時半則招待外國各報社駐滬記者。</p>
<p>席間，卡氏表示渠已決心學習中國話，將以學習中國話作為其初步工作之一。記者詢以對美僑在華經商之意見，卡氏稱，復興正常貿易關係在戰後實極爲重要。渠本人即願爲此項復興工作而努力。並稱，貿易的成敗，本與經濟，政治情形之正常與否有關，同時必須視貿易商對此種情形有何信心而定。</p>
<p>卡氏復表示，此問美僑商人經營商業，應盡力遵守目前中國政府所訂之管理及限制辦法，中國政府所以實施此項辦法，實有其必要。但有若千情形，美商若發現不可能法照規定辦法進行者，則美政府可向中國政府據理指出此項辦法對於中美兩國雙方利益均有損失，而使中國政府明瞭其實際情形。</p>
<p>關於美國一般人士對由國目前局勢之意見，卡氏答謂，美國國內意見各有不同。但其基本意見是同一的，即一致願意協助巾國使减輕其困難處境，並對中國之獨立及主權表示尊敬。</p>
<p>卡氏抵滬後，忙於酬酢，並將與木市各首長相見。日內即將　訪吳市長。今日下午六時，卡氏夫婦將應代理總領事畢爾吉夫婦之請赴社美路七十號出席晚宴。</p>

<h3>嚴重煤荒　短時期內　可望解決　公用事業用量　暫時不予減少</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕本年煤荒，已進入最嚴重階段。據悉本市現時存煤，僅足維持三十五天之用，約可用至二月二十日左右。燃管會爲此特召開會議，決定請公用局所轄之各公用事業機關，即日起將用煤减少一半，略謀補救。公用局以燃煤爲最大原動力，若煤量减半後，工作亦須停頓其半。影響市民衣食住行殊鉅，經提市府市政會議商討後，決勉予維持原狀，暫不减少煤量，惟即責成各公司儘量節省，謹愼運用，俾共渡目前難關。</p>
<p>惟據趙局長昨表示：嚴重之煤荒，短期內可望解決，本市現有存煤七萬餘噸，台灣啟運來滬之煤約爲四萬餘噸，華中亦有四萬餘噸運滬，且本市各公用事業公司平均尙有存煤，足敷二十天之用。現中央已令中央銀行撥給外匯，由中央信託局向加拿大定購美煤十萬噸，二月二十日左右可到，且北寗鐵路石局長曾來電，吿知自開灤至新港之鐵路業已通車，第一車已開出，則該地存煤即可源源運來，供上海之用云。</p>

<h3>查禁茶舞　分區執行　新舞女停止登記　傳習所再度訴願</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕禁舞命令及各項辦法日前到達本市後，警局營業科昨已奉令執行。各分局巳將所有　員，按照舞廳·酒吧·咖啡室所在地區分成若干小糾，出動巡察是否仍有茶室舞舉行。警局於昨日下午並加派大批少年警察分赴各舞塲檢查，舞廳業同業公會已通知所屬廿九家會員舞臺遵令停止茶室舞。警局方面除仍准已登記之舞女轉期外，新舞女自昨日起一慨停止登記。惟據統計去年十一月份舞女登記總數爲二·；〇二二人，自禁舞辦法公佈後，截至昨日止，登記之舞女總數已减至一，六四五人，故預料茶室舞查禁後，今後舞女　將逐漸减少。至救濟舞女之善後辦法，現正由社會局統籌中。</p>
<p>此外本市尙有領照營業之咖啡室伴舞吧女計三一四人，及舞藝傳習所廿九家，亦在查禁範圍以內，昨晚傳習所代表曾舉行緊急大會，決定推舉包龍雲，李雅聲，周約翰，錢宗廉四人夜車赴京，向行政院再訴願，渠等所持理由爲：　舞校並不訓練舞女，而係純粹研究舞蹈藝術之所，舞校所收學生之名單及資歷可提供當局審閱。　英國舞藝學院每月均受政府津貼，常局應視舞校爲正當學術團體，施以管理及監督，不能迫令停閉。　舞校敎師生活淸苦，所收學費一時頗難退還，故希望將結束限期延展相當時日。聞集　將　運力　到底，並再向當局陳述黨以則行結束之苦衷。同時渠等已呈請市府於行政院再訴　未批復以前，晳報執行。</p>
<h3>新任輸管會主任委員　霍寶樹就職視事　輸出輸入力求平衡發展</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕新任輸管會主委霍寳樹，昨日上午十時，在巾國銀行四樓大禮堂舉行正式就職儀式。霍氏當對轍管會全體工作人員致訓，指出過去管理輸出入政策，變動過劇，殊不適宜。並稱：輸管會爲一複雜之業務機構，今後工作之推動，當力求簡單，避免繁復，並提出原則三點：　國際貿易應求公道，　各業間之限額分配，應求公平，　本身之處事態度，應求公正。輸管會之工作效率將力求提高，使成爲一健全之組織。霍氏特別强調兩點：一爲輸管會之各項規定，非萬不得已時，不輕作變更，以免商人有無所適從之苦。二爲進口商之權利義務應求平衡，易言之，進口商不應以取得限額分配爲滿足，而應進一步協助政府推廣外銷，爭取外匯。</p>
<p>霍氏視事後，接見記者，對提出之各項問題，作簡明答覆如下：　華南走私現仍猖獗，惟預料短期內情形將有改善，因我國政府現已加强緝私辦法，並可取得香港政府之合作。　今後之輸出輸入，應求平衡發展，並與有關部門配合，適應當前需要，對於進口限額之多寡，應求其合理，我國農村之產品，應儘量鼓勵其輸出，目前各國均缺乏美元，故易貨之方式，値得考慮。</p>

<h3>張桂年的發明之夢　未完成的濬河激水機　離開實際研究試騐的科學道路　走上途徑竟妄想鉅額獎金　跟吳鼎昌薛篤弼打官司</h3>
<p>〔本報南京十五日訊〕「發明家」張桂年，懷着一個熱中於發明濬河激水機的美夢，並且想在這個夢裏獲得政府對他發一筆鉅額的獎金。可是，當他這一個夢破碎了的時候，他却並不打算追究他失敗的原因，而走上從法律途徑來控吿現任國府文官長吳鼎昌和現任水利部長薛篤弼，他的理田是他的發明報到水利部遲遲沒有批示，這其中未見有讓人抄襲之嫌，而且他的發明，政府的獎勵也不應該只有區區五十萬元，因此，他認爲吳薛二氏一面抹煞了他的發明苦心，一面還似乎尅扣了他的獎金。</p>
<p>張桂年居然興訟了，而被吿正是當今位居要津的高官，這是和他發明浚河激水機不經試騐而自信必獲成功的能度一樣。同時，他還經常做一件事，就是不斷的函呈蔣主席，據說過去有一段時期，他就是十天一上書，眞是苦心而有恒，不能不令人驚佩！現在，這</p>
<p>一塲訟事　將要於本月廿七日在上海地方法院開庭了。記者曾經去訪問過薛篤弼部長，問他是否去出庭，他笑笑說：「我不會去理他，許多事實，不必我去說明，而且，我們只當他是有神經病患者」。薛氏這些話也不無理由，現在一我們試看看他的發明經過。</p>
<p>張桂年是天津人，現年四十五歲，童年進私塾，十五歲時，因家貧輟學，他在天津是住在海河之演。在民國六年的時候，華北一帶，大水爲災，海河乃裁灣取直，三岔河口廢，河道直流，但積淤仍不能减，這對於發明家張桂年就在他</p>
<p>海河之濱　的住宅裏，聽著激怒了的水聲，開始了他發明的動機。當然這個動機是在於救人救世，絡於他在水流的形勢上，悟出了有一種新發明的必耍，於是決心要發明濬河激水機，使水流成迴旋形，水流不息，而且不至再有淤積的事情。</p>
<p>這是個什麼東西呢？就是用以裝在</p>
<p>平底船上　的一個以迴旋形四葉的簡便機器，以鐵板製成，直經三丈，葉厚六七尺，完全用水流力，本身無動力，但可將水流力變爲衝擊力可衝擊五十華里。</p>
<p>當他把關於這項發明的說明，呈水利部後，水利部就派了技正彭篤生和他接洽，據說彭前後去了六次，和他談話，每次總有二三小時之久。張對彭的表示是在未試驗前，不接受批評，主觀的認爲必會成功。因此，水利部在不得他的藍圖及</p>
<p>試驗說明　等等實際事例證明後，研究了又硏究，認爲待考的地力很多，於是才決定給他五十萬元的補助金，以獎勵張對於發明濬河激水機的苦心。</p>
<p>事實就是這樣，可是張基於他那名利雙收的美夢，他不願僅拿五十萬元的補助金了事，終於憤憤地採取了</p>
<p>法律解決　之一途。</p>
<p>現在，我要向讀者報道的是張桂年的爲人。　張在十五歲以後，就職學習商，到民國十八九年，曾歷次上書蔣主席及閻總司令，縱談時政，後來又上書當時天津市市長及各省委，都未得要領，到廿年冬，再上書段執政，這一次是獲得了意外的召見，但並未獲得任何工作，最後，又上書天津市社會局，方得在社會局任辦事員數年，抗戰後，於民卅一年離津到上海，在紗布交易所任職。去年十二月間，再開始上書蔣主席及行政院，呈述他的發明浚河激水機的經過，一直到現在。</p>
<p>發明家須具備的最重要的條件之一，是接受批評，可是張桂年不接受批評。同時，在發明過程中必須有試驗說明，他却從未試驗，又無從加以說明，這是一種超事實的固執。到底訴訟結果將是怎樣，待廿七日法庭上一塲審訊後，當可明瞭一切吧。（本報記者張明）</p>
<h3>蘇省督運軍糧　大部均已完成</h3>
<p>〔本報鎭江十六日電〕蘇省田糧處爲加緊督運本年一二月份軍粗，經分派幹員逕赴各縣嚴催，結果良好，大部業經完成，惟因目前正値隆冬，水位低落，運輸頗感困難，致運費頗多增加，該處運輸組長表示決排除萬難，以期完成。</p>
<h3>避讓當路野狗　人車翻身墮河　蘇州鉅商季小松　子受重傷侄兒死</h3>
<p>州十五日訊〕蘇州十四日下午發生一陸車慘劇，乘車者一死一傷，緣有木業鉅子季小松者，係本邑商界聞人，曾任商會會長，最近在家休養，十四日下午三時許，其子善初出外接治商業，偕堂兄坤一，固　自備機器脚踏柬前往，途經臨頓路蘋花橋時，因避　當路野犬，一時車頭把握不穩，竟致撞人河中。出事後，附近崗警，即奮勇躍入河中救援，將二人一一拖起，奈季坤一左腦太陽穴已撿破一洞，血鎭四溢，季善初傷在面部，尙無大礙，惟內部受震過烈，一時神智尙糢糊不淸。死者季坤一，尙有老母嬌妻，聞耗後倉懺趕臨，撫屍大慟，先後暈厥，慘不忍覩。</p>
<h3>鄱湖水位低落</h3>
<p>〔本報鄱陽十五日電〕鄱陽湖為贛省內河唯一水庫，水位之漲落，關係航運交通。上年鄱湖水源不大，秋後兩月亢旱，兼之江水驟降，湖水外瀉，尤以龍口，猪母山一帶淤　最甚，民輪航行，均感困難。沿湖各縣，大宗土產，多堆積總，樂，不能暢行，景德瓷器，樂平煤觔，多由晋祁公路及旱道車蓮出口。</p>
<h3>平糶　常州救濟兩萬貧民</h3>
<p>〔本報武進十五日訊〕本邑當局爲物價高漲，維持貧民生計起見，特由縣府邀集各機關代表，決定平糶辦法，平糶對象，根據冬令救濟會貧民名册，估計二萬餘人，總米數三千石，平　差額，由商會負責三億，限本月底繳淸，不足數由積穀委會負責。平糶糧源由積穀會供應，隨糶隨購，由糧公會辦理。平糶五天一期，分四期舉行，每期大口四升，小口三升，分東南西北中五處辦理。第一期自陰曆十二月初十起至廿五日止，一切手續正趕辦中。</p>
<h3>蘇州立委競選　達短失相接階段</h3>
<p>〔本報蘇州十五日訊〕蘇州立委競選活動日趨白熱，各候選人宣傳戰序幕業已揭開，國民黨提各之嚴欣淇，與民社黨提名之宋績成，角逐最烈，街頭競選標語，五色績紛，入晚酒摟茶肆，燈炬通明，幕後拉票，實已至短兵相接地步。嚴氏現任參議會議長，平日熱心地方公益，推行不遺餘力，於鄉鎭保甲中極有信仰，兼以散佈各鄉鎮之百餘參議員，熱烈支持，幾將席捲全蘇選票。宋氏執行律務，係法界前輩，於舊社會中頗有潛力，此次參加競選，係由縉紳階級推舉，勢亦將傾力競爭，其他來蘇活動之外縣候選人，尙有太倉狄膺，松江吳紹澍，吳江仲肇湘等多人，彼此鈎心鬥角，如火如茶，民主氣氛相當充沛。</p>
<h3>天堂漪漣　新疆歌舞團在杭州</h3>
<p>〔本報杭州十五日電〕元月十日，新疆歌舞團被西湖號遊暨車載到杭州來了。那是一個陰晴的午間，杭州城站的人擠得水洩不通，護路警察雖然賣足了力氣，但也沒有方法維持好秩序。車到了，更是擁擠不堪，好容易擠出一條路來，讓她們跨上在杭州最漂亮的兩輛遊覽汽車，直放裏西湖的新新旅館。</p>
<p>七八天的招待　下午，她們出席了各界歡迎會，表演了幾個節目。第二天冒雨遊了北山，第三天玩了湖，參觀靑年會，第四天登玉皇山之巔，又去六和塔，錢江大橋，再到世界「最優良學府環境」的之江大學。第五天參觀了他們那裏所沒有的織綢廠，絲織風景廠，靑年館，第六天參觀了國立藝術專科學校與國立浙江大學，第七天參觀了空軍軍官學校。</p>
<p>新疆歌舞團來在杭州的七八天裘，幾乎天天把日程排得很緊湊，每天有三四個機關團體宴會，每天有一二處茶會，到處擁擠着人看她們，幾個表演的夜塲，把戲院的鐵門都擠破了，太平門擠塌了，人塞滿在塲內，來欣賞她們的舞藝。四十個新疆兒女，確然把道溫靜的西子湖面，滲入了組獲的原始的情緒而欣起了漪漣了。</p>
<p>歌舞團的產生　記者曾和她信有七八天功夫的盤桓，所以知道她們比較淸楚，他們是新疆省政府宣傳委員會所組織的，原來在新疆地方，歌舞是極其普遍的，五六歲能够跑跳的兒童，與七八十歲的老年人，都會跳舞唱歌。這個歌舞團的產生，是由各區選拔比較善於歌舞的人來參加的。在迪化訓練了一個月，就出發到南京來了。在她們這一羣人中，敎育程度以師範畢業者爲最多，其次是中學，再次是小學。在新疆，有一個新疆學院，還有省立師範學校，省立中學，省立女中。</p>
<p>報人參加在內　盛世才治新的時代，學校裏要　俄文，現在學校裏不讀俄文了，僅是維吾爾族文和國文。維吾爾文是比較近似土耳其文的。當地有報紙三種：一爲新疆日報，一爲自由日報，一爲維漢日報，這三種報紙，每種都僅銷一千數百份。聽說本來每種報紙銷行一萬份以上，後來因爲交通受阻，所以銷數日趨下跌。另有一種刊物，名阿爾泰月刋，銷行也僅一千多份。在這歌舞團中，有兩位是新聞記者一即阿爾泰月刊的總編輯海比爾先生，一即新疆，自由兩報的記者帕麗達女士。然而他們並不是隨國的記者，而是團員，是歌舞手。</p>
<p>勿把新疆見外　他們希望我們不要把新疆見外了。在盛世才的時代，聽說漢人是欺侮維人的。到張治中治新以後，，漢維眞的是一家了。他們不喜歡沒有民族，沒有國家的主義，他們愛民族，也愛國家，由於他們的信仰，由於他們善良的知能的發揮，相信伊犂問題就會解決的。</p>
<p>新疆風物一斑　在新疆街頭，沒有香蕉，梨，與一些東南產的水菓，那裏瓜特別多，又甜又香。穿的多半是羊毛的，綢是名貴的衣料。有上賓來的時候，用抓飯來享客，即是用菓和飯燒在一起，用手來抓的，不像我們這裏那樣一道道的　肴上個不了。喪葬是用白布綑縛屍身埋入土內，不用棺材的。</p>
<p>這次，他們來到了因地，受着內地的人們這樣熱烈的歡迎，他們將以無比的高興回去傳達我們的盛意。他們更企求着我們內地的文化能與邊疆的文化起着交流的作用。他們要我們把新疆看成唇齒相依，盡量的扶助他們。</p>
<p>邊疆文化研究　現在，我們畢竟看見了他們的文化了。那粗獷愉快的音樂，那簡樸活潑的舞蹈。尤其那器樂中領導樂器的笛，舞姿中擺動的頸，這都是我們自己的文化，道是我們祖先所遺傳給我們的寶貝。我們豈可忘却了它，豈可不去研究改良它，而別求於洋琴洋鼓，大腿與靡靡之音之間呢？我們眞的衰老了嗎？不，邊疆的文化還年靑得很呢，我們只要研究改良，便有茁壯雄健的一天。</p>
<p>他們在杭州的七八天，被「天堂」上的人民所熱烈愛戴着，同樣的，他們也被「天堂」的環境所陶醉了。希望他們去後，把我們這裏的熱情與文物帶去，把他們的熱情與表演的精神留下，讓我們抖擻起精神，好好地研究改良，來充實我們自己的民族文化。（本報時派員儲裕生）</p>

<h3>滬公私立專科以上學校　抗議九龍城事件　發表聯合宣言　提出五項要求</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕上海市公私立專科以上學校校長章益，朱經農，歐元　，凌憲　等三十餘人，於日前出席上海市獎學金統一審核委義會，討論英國香港政府强迫拆除九龍城內中國居民住　問題，議決推請朱經農等七人負實起草，以「上海市專科以上學校聯合會」名　發表聯合宣言。茲誌宣言全文如下：　最近英國香港政府，强迫拆除九龍城內我國居民住屋，槍傷無辜居民多人，迭成流血事件，並非法拘捕居民代表判罰苦役，此種蔑視我國主權與遠背人道之行爲，實使吾人不能不作嚴正之表示。</p>
<p>查一八九八年六月九日所訂中英展拓香港界址事條，曾規定：「所有現在九龍城內駐紥之中國官員，仍可在城內各司其事，又議定仍留附近九龍城原舊馬頭一區，以便中國兵商各船渡艇任便往來停泊，且便城內官民任便行走」，可見九龍城及其附近碼頭與海面，我國政府仍保有主權。今香港政府竟違法强迫拆隊我國管轄領土內之中國居民住屋，實屬破壞我國主權之侵略行動。</p>
<p>英國政府近對殖民地之統治，漸取溫和政策如准許印度與緬甸之獨立，此在中國人民視之，誠爲可喜之事，不料香港政府今仍一味執行過去帝國全義之侵略政策，實令人無限遺憾與憤慨。中英兩國戰</p>
<p>時結成同盟，我國軍隊曾在印緬戰塲協同英軍並肩作戰，友誼極佳，今戰事結束不久，而英國政府即以此種熊度對待其先前之忠實盟友，殊有背交友之道。姑置上述各點不論，吾人素知英國向極尊崇個人自由，財產，與生命，今竟進法强迫拆除中國居民住屋，使無數人民流離失所，並對手無寸鐵之老弱婦孺開槍射擊，致重傷多人，造成流血事件，此實爲遠背人道之殘酷行爲。</p>
<h3>賠償一切損失　嚴懲負責人員</h3>
<p>吾人均為服務敎育界之人士，對香港政府此種侵害中國主權與違反人道之行爲，實不能不提出嚴正之抗議。吾人珍惜英國對華友誼，亦竭誠希望英國人士勿輕予此種友誼以傷害。須知維護中國主權之獨立完整，實爲每一中國人之責任與義務，不論政見如何，宗敎信仰如何，舉國一致共同抱此決心。英國政府絕不能以中國目前內部多事，而蔑視我全國人民一致維護主權之意志。吾人現除督促並靜候政府提出嚴重抗議與交涉外，特對英國政府提出下列要求：　賠償九龍城內受書居民之一切損失。　立即釋放非法拘捕之居民。　嚴懲此次事件之負責人員，　向中國政府與人民道歉。　保證此後不再發生類似事件。</p>
<h3>先行交還九龍根絕不幸事件</h3>
<p>抑吾人尤有不能已於言者：此次不幸事件之發生，全係九龍城之主權爭執問題所引起。吾人爲杜絕此後糾紛根源，並促進中英友好關係起見，主張英國政府應即先行交還九龍租借地。蓋租借地之設置，原爲十九世紀末年各帝國主義國家乘滿淸政府孱弱之際，而强行訂約租借，主權固仍屬中國。現我國已爲一獨立自主之國家，膠州與廣州撥等租借地均已先後收回，英國亦應即日交還九龍租借地，藉以根絕此後不幸事件之發生。至於香港雖屬割讓英國，惟該地密　華南，在政治經濟與軍事上均與中國有密切不可分割之關係，英國政府亦應即與吾國政府舉行談判，早日交還我國。如此不僅類似九龍城之流血事件不至再行發生，且中英關係亦必將更趨密切，時此宣言。</p>

<h3>告全國人民書</h3>
<p>茲將上海市各大學學生團體，抗議九龍事件聯合實，吿全國人民書，原文誌下：「由於政府的堅定領導，人民的犧牲奮鬥，入年抗戰擊潰頑敵一，取消不平等條約，祇因共匪兩年倡亂，引狼入定，燒殺擄掠，破壞主權領土完整，迫害毀損人民生活，以是四强之國際地位，日益降低，新外人對我之輕視剝奪，舊熊復前。香港九龍，理應由我國收復之領土，英政府却霸佔不讓，香港政府更擺出舊帝國主義面孔，前旣造成屏山機塲事件，今復武力强迫拆毀中國人民在中國領土之之居屋，逮捕居民代表，蠻橫無理，几我國人聞之，無不義憤塡膺，痛恨不已。我上海市各大學同學，更爲國家尊嚴之被侵犯，同胞手足之被蹂躪，坐臥不安，因特一面上警蔣主席，請求加强戡亂建國，充實國防實力，採取强硬外交，武力收回港九，對此次九龍事件，我人民之一切損失，要求英政府應即賠償，我全國靑年誓不惜再戰，以爲政府後盾，一面發表吿全國人民書，烯望共同要求政府，加强戡亂建國，實行强硬外交，並立即各盡所能，捐款慰問九龍居民。同胞們，軍閥割據，引來日寇的侵略，共匪倡亂，造成東北，西北，九龍等一連串喪權辱國的不幸事件。我們必須像打倒軍閥一樣地打倒共匪，才能解決一切外來不幸事件。我們必須有獨立自主的强硬外交，才能保護我們的同胞，打擊一切紅白帝國主義者的狂燄」。</p>

<h3>足委會本屆工作</h3>
<p>足球委員會本屆工作，爲：　聯賽因開賽較　，改爲單循環制，其餘各組照舊。　盃責：市長盃開始報名，幼級盃已在進行中。　受主華全國體育協進會委託，籌備舉行上海區世運預選。　籌備舉行滬港埠際賽，農曆元旦在港舉行。</p>
<h3>世運預選　體協會決議</h3>
<p>中華全國體育協進會爲籌備組織蠢加世運足球隊，去年曾由董監事全體會議決議：　聘請容啓兆周家騏余衡之黃家駿李惠堂五氏爲選拔委員，由本人任主席。　因便利南洋各地新加坡小呂宋爪哇西貢僑胞派隊參加預選，及氣候關係，決定分香港上海兩區預選，華北華中華西華東則參加上海區。　全國體協會經費困難，因須藉足球隊出議時，沿途舉行比賽，以門票收入，補助旅費，故足球隊將提早出國，因此預選響不得不提前舉行。全運會雖定五月五日舉行，但體協會不能不進備萬一。　足球隊出關路綫暫定經小呂宋澳洲紐西蘭南美洲而到達英國。</p>
<h3>赴港任務　接洽經過</h3>

<p>本人赴港引起之誤會，本人未拜訪各球會主持人，及華人足球聯合會，其原因由於本人赴港之資格與任務，己如上述，因與球會無關，自與拜訪之必要。全國協　已直接函請香港分會，呈報預選事宣，本人旣非協會代表，自無機過問。港華人足球聯合會亦非中華全國國體協會直屬圖體。再本人向記者談話有攻學私人之嫌，此　本人更應糾正，按本人辦理體育事業純以興趣所及，絕無任何野心，更談不到與任何個人有利害衝突，該地記者以星島日報粗詢，所載新聞本人僅以私人意見答覆。至　本人在港澳胡君　優一節，純屬有意迭謠，盡本人根本未與胡君樣面。參加世運乃國家體面，應得各方面諒解與贊助，希望新聞界同志，多予指導及批評。</p>

<h3>交通銀行體育組　今晚舉行慶祝會</h3>
<p>交通銀行同仁聯　會體育組，在主持人李　哉任祖　王九成等提倡下，成續斐然，收檴殊　，參加外界比賽，連獲三項錦標，計：　四行兩局主辦之六聯盃，　上海市小型球內組，　銀錢盃籃球聯賽，均得總冠軍，茲該行定今日下午六時，假西川路二六一號四行大樓八樓，舉行慶祝聯歡聚　大會，屆時必有一番盛况，並將招待體育新聞界云，</p>

<h3>桐油猪鬃成本高昂　出口尙未臻活潑</h3>
<p>國內桐油猪鬃價格，最近因一般物價上漲，各地價均吿報漲，致成本高昂，更難出口。桐油價格計重慶每市担一六六萬元，漢口二二七萬元，上海二八〇萬元，長沙二三〇萬元，萬縣一八二萬元，梧州二二八萬元，廣州二六六萬六千元。</p>
<p>國外售價，因年節實銷欠銷，紐約現貨每磅美金二角六分二五，香港方面發電價每磅C&amp;F美金二角五分二五，倫敦桶裝汕每畏噸OFF英磅一八六鎊。</p>
<p>中港協定實施後，桐油走私香港必然减少，惟已到香港存貨向港政府登記者，可免提供結匯證書，故短期內香港貨價仍不致扳情，</p>
<p>猪鬃價格，計重慶鬃每關担二千八百萬元，漢口黑　洗製一七號配籍之生貨，已喊四千萬元，但未做開。上海　二千八百萬元</p>
<p>國外市價，天津大五五C&amp;F紐約每磅美金八元，小五五美金六元，均係賣方發價，尙乏成交。重慶　廿七號配箱C&amp;F每磅美金二元二角，已有少敷做開。倫教價CFF十四先令六便士，漢口　及C&amp;F紐約美金三元二角五分，上海鬃二元二角五分，均尙堅挺？惟以國內成本隨一般物價增高，出口未臻活潑。</p>
<h3>日貨水泥運港　水泥公會請嚴防走私</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕全國水泥公會根據確息，最近有大批日貨水泥一萬四千餘包，運抵香港，嗣後並將源源續來。該會鑒於港地建築需要，至爲有限。且國產泰山牌。象牌·五羊等守牌水泥，素有充分供應。該批水泥之最後出路，必將伺機偷運各處銷售無疑。當此國產水泥供過於求，銷路極為式徽之時，該會對於運港日貨水泥動向，極爲注意。刻己電請關務署等負責當局，分行沿海各關，嚴防其走私國內，以杜後患云。</p>

<p>文史</p>
<h3>文章與語言</h3>
<p>— 周祖謨</p>
<p>語言與文學同是表達思想的工具，但是並不完全相同，因爲鼐言是用許多聲音來表白思想，而文章是以書寫的方式來代替語言，所以不同。我們說話的時候，不但在聲音辭氣上可以有揚抑輕重的分別，還可以有情感姿態的表現，用以帮助他人的了解；這都不是文章中可以完全稱情表現出來的。因此陸機文賦說：「恒患意不稱物，文不逮意」，正是進個道理。同時在領受者的一方面，文章又不若語言之直接，舉凡爲文的意旨，詞品的虛實及語氣的輕重等，都要讀者從文字上去體察玩味，終不免又隔一層。因此在效能上也不一定完全相若。</p>
<p>但是文章雖與語言不同物，然絕不可脫離語言而獨立。捨語言而談文章的　法，是捨本逐末的。文章是代表語言的東西，語言就是文章的根源，詞藻格局全是末事。泛觀古人的文章，其精妙者都是有如說話的，凡有如說話的文章，也就最生動。甚至於呆板叙事的史傳文字，如挿入問答語，則自見靈活，引人入勝。例如史記即慣用此法，其信陵君列傳（卷七十七）前後所載對話幾過半，所以極見精采。其他直錄口語的亦多。如周昌傳（卷九十六）述昌諫高帝廢太子事云：</p>
<p>帝欲廢太子而立戚姬子如意爲太子，大臣固爭之，莫能得。周昌廷爭之强，上問其說，昌爲人口吃，又盛怒，曰：「臣口不能言，然臣期期知其不可。陛下雖欲廢太子，臣期期不奉詔」。上欣然而笑。</p>
<p>此將周昌口吃期期之聲都寫下來，極爲生動。又如後漢魯的文字亦有不少平易近人的。例如范滂傳（卷五十七）寫滂入獄後王甫鞠訊的話：</p>
<p>君爲人臣，不推忠國，而共造部黨，自相褒舉，評論朝廷，虛構無端；諸所謀結，並欲何爲？皆以情對，不得隱飾！</p>
<p>這雖是四言一句，然全是口語，主甫聲色俱厲的情景均已表現無遺。據此可知要使文筆靈活淸順，都不能不從實際的語言上留意。</p>
<p>相反的，我們看新唐書的文章，總覺其中文氣不暢的地方太多。所以王若虛滹南遺老集內有新唐書辨（文集卷廿二至廿四），專門攻發其短。例如所舉舊唐書令狐德蔡傳云：</p>
<p>高宗常召宰相及宏文館學士，問：「何修而王？何爲而霸？二者熟先」？德棻對曰：「如欲行之，王道爲最；而行之爲難」。高宗曰：今之所行，何政爲要」？而新唐書改為：</p>
<p>帝問曰：「何修而王？若而覇？又常孰先」？對曰：「若用之，王爲先；而莫難焉」。帝曰：「今茲何爲而要」？</p>
<p>以二者相較，自然可以看出宋祁所作是如何的詭異晦澀不合語法了。與前面所舉正是相反，這就是文章脫離語言的毛病。</p>
<p>今日的文體有文言與語體之分，現在仍有人以爲作文言文自有文言文的文法，與語體接近口語的不同，文章必以古雅爲高。但是這僅是一面的看法，如果認淸文章要與語言相近的話，自然發現古代的文章除了虛字語詞與今語聲音有異外，在句法上仍然是說話的語法。設若捨語言而談文法是錯誤的。因爲語言上的習慣用法就是文法，合乎語言，即合乎文法了。現在的語言都是由局秦傳下來的，語音雖與古代不同，語言中詞字排列的方式（即Syntax）尙無大變。古代書寫的工具困難，故文句簡奧難明，如尙書及金文之一部，都不若後世文句之淸暢易曉。此乃事所必然，固可不論。然而自春秋時代以後的文章就淸楚多了。即如論語一言，去今雖已二千餘年，今日讀來依然可堯，就因爲它根據了當時的魯語寫下來的。不但語詞次第一樣，就是語言中的語助詞都一一寫出，幾乎等於說話。足見文章要與語言相附麗，才能使</p>
<p>可是歷代的文格，頗有變易，有人喜歡取法乎上，學習漢魏的文章，本亦無妨；不過要有所抉摘。漢人的文章其艱深者固多，而平淺的也有。文章以達意爲主，無貴乎艱深。如漢書文帝紀所載詔書有云：</p>
<p>道民之路在於務本。朕親率天下農，十年於今，而野不加闢；歲一不登，民有飢色；是從喜焉尙寡而吏未加務也。吾詔書數下，歲勸民種樹，而功未興，是吏奉吾詔不勤而勸民不明也。且吾農民甚苦，而吏莫之省，將何以勸焉？其賜農民今年租稅之半。</p>
<p>又刑法志載文帝除肉刑詔云：蓋聞有虞氏之時畫衣冠異章服以爲戮　而民弗犯，何治之至也？今法有肉刑三，而姦不止，其咎安在？非乃朕德之薄而敎不明與？吾甚自愧。故夫訓道不純，而愚民陷焉。詩曰：愷弟君子，民之父母。今人有過，敎未施而刑已加焉；或欲改行爲善，而道無　至；朕甚憐之。夫刑至斷支體，刻肌膚，終身不息，何其刑之痛而不德也？豈稱「爲民父母」之意哉！其除肉刑，有以易之。</p>
<p>這都是第一等明快的文字，所以劉熙載　概中說：「西漢文之最不可及者，文帝之韶書也。周書呂刑，論者以爲哀矜惻怛，猶可以想見三代忠厚之遺意。然彼丈至而實不至，孰若文帝之情至而文生耶」？然而劉氏所謂情至而文生者，即語無不眞，傾肺腑以出之；，而寫成之文句即是語言，自然就美妙了。古人說：「修辭立其誠」，又說：「辭達而已矣」。其意未始不如是。</p>
<p>然而齊梁以後駢偶的文章盛行起來，在文體　　然是一種大變動。可是名家於講求聲律格調之外，仍然注意筆致的流暢。下至隋唐，作四六文的人便濫用古人成語，廣引故事，以銜其博學了。以致文章與語言隔離。不但叙事不明，而且了無生氣。因此直至絲愈乃提倡復古運動，將積習加以播除。所謂「復古」，是恢復了古人作文章的方法，並非　襲古人的詞句，而　其形貌。目此文章文走上　暢的途徑。韓愈答李翊　論文云：</p>
<p>氣水也，言浮物也。水大而物之浮者大小畢浮。氣之與言猶是也，氣盛則言之短長與聲之高下者管宜。</p>
<p>他所說的「氣」，就是「理直氣壯」之「氣」；「言」就是心中「有所欲言」之「言」。而語言之發，皆由氣呼造作而成，那就是「氣」以載「言」了。且凡人之說話自有一貫的辭氣，辭氣盛，則言亦盛，辭氣順，則言亦順。然則爲文必與辭氣相應，是很明顯的事情。以往古文家儘管心知其意，然始終沒有說明白。宋代的古文家如歐蘇，固是能手，也是積漸陶養而成的。其功力之深，可以」紆徐委備，往復百折，而條達疏暢，無所間斷」；可以「容與閒易，無艱難勞苦之態」（見蘇洵上歐陽內翰書）。然亦一由讀韓文久，而悟到文章與語言的關係的。</p>
<p>在此並非有意標榜唐宋八家，實在是八家足以代表能依照古人「文」與「言」一貫的方法來作文的。所以自明末茅鹿門唐荆川以迄淸代桐城派的文家，都特重八家，也絕非無故。至於明代李夢陽之復古，爲文有如伐木鑒石，徒供後人所笑而已，往者章太炎先生早年爲文，頗喜慕效秦漢以上文字，文多古字，語多簡奧。但是晚年論文，仍以爲初學當從八家入手。且其自作如章氏叢書續編所收的文章，也都一變故常，變爲冲淡雅正了。足見章先生充然有得，從經驗中體察出文軍的正軌來，是暗與理合的。如此來說，歷史上的文格雖變，而文章之美惡在修整之外，首先要看是否與語言相若了。凡與語言不相應的，多半不足爲法。</p>
<p>總之，無論作何種文體的文章，流利暢達，有如說話，是第一要義。滯塞生硬，不合語言習慣的，都是不相宜的。</p>
<p>謹因朝貢使往，奏狀不宜，謹狀。</p>
<p>八月十五日權知歸義軍兵馬留後，守沙州長史。銀靑光祿大夫，檢校吏部尙書。</p>
<p>兼御史大夫，上柱國曹仁貴狀上。（上鈴「沙州節度使印」，）</p>
<p>可見曹義金的前，尙有曹仁貴一代。據舊五代史三十一莊宗紀同光二年五月乙丑：『以權知歸義軍留後曹義金爲歸義軍節度使沙州刺史檢校司空』，而冊府元龜九八〇亦言同光中沙州畏史曹義金遺使朝貢」，曹仁貴和曹義金同爲留後，同爲長史，只是曹仁貴爲檢校吏部尙書面曹義金則朝廷加檢校司空罷了。再就一般的派名慣例說，義前一代往往爲仁字，而仁前一代爲義字的甚少，又元德元忠輩有很多證據爲義金之子，所以仁貴爲義金的前一代無疑，而義金正是仁貴的承繼人了。</p>

<h3>錢玄同先生遺札</h3>
<p>適之：</p>
<p>詩經新注中關於「韻」的問題，我想簡直可以不去理他。因爲——</p>
<p>我們只能考到某字與某字古同韻或古異韻，並不能斷定某韻是讀怎樣的音。例如我們知道采蘋末章之「下」「女」古同在「模」韻，却不能斷定這「模」韻和現在一樣讀成「X」音。</p>
<p>即使勉强假定了，但今音旣不如此讀，則與吾人讀詩經中詩的音節全無關係。</p>
<p>况且這押韻字的古今異讀，於詩的藝術上絲毫不受影響。</p>
<p>因此，我覺得此事竟可不必去理會他。惟詩經中難讀的字，或某字在某詩中不照普通讀法者，似應注明其讀音。我以為最好是用注意字母注現代的音—即所謂國音。「赬」字音「　　」；「怒如調　」之「調」音」「　　」；羔羊中「委蛇」音「　　　」。這因為預備給中學生讀的，所以罕見之字與罕見之音都注明讀音。此意吾兄以為然否？</p>
<p>你這部注做成了之後，我想奉贈短序一篇。這篇短序中一切「廢話」一概不說，單表明一件事：「芼」即「摸」，「痛」即「瘦」，以及苤　詩中之「　」「襭」用徵語說明之類，我想此類新訓詁，以後一定還很多。這一層一定要惹起一班「食古不化」的先生們的反對。但我以為這實在是對於漢唐以來陋儒所說訓詁的革命，古義必須用了這個方法，才能「撥　霧而見青天」。這個方法就是——</p>
<p>從聲音上求字義，不為字形所拘。</p>
<p>以今語證古義。</p>
<p>自黃生，錢大昕，王念孫父子發明　法，於是弄明白了許多古義；章太炎師作新方言，發明　法，又弄明白了許多古義。我們現在讀古書非用此法不可，而吾見即用此法，所以打算作一短序表彰一下，一以證明你用此法將詩經中字義講明白了許多，一以指示閱著對於古書難明之字義須用此法去通證明他。你以為何如？</p>

<h3>關於「排當樂次」</h3>
<p>— 閣金鍔</p>
<p>適之先生：</p>
<p>拙作「排當樂次」辱蒙惠刋於申報文史第二·三期（十二月十三日二十日），深覺榮幸。但有幾點，須待聲明和更正：一·文中所說『盧先生所引用的武林舊事是什麼本子，沒有注明。』這是事實。但接着說『我們若拿幾種本子的武林奮事做一比較，便可知道他所用的一定是上海進步避的有光紙本。」這恐怕不是我的原文。假若是我的原文我也承認這是我的錯誤。因爲進步書局的有光紙本是和知不足齋　書本是相同的。盧先生所引用的文字，現在我已找到了根據，是從許之衡先生的戲曲史（北京大學出版組印的講義）輾轉引來的。不過，盧先生所引的只是「文字」，而沒有把「標點」引用。這是什麼意思，我不知道。單就文字說，許史所脫落，或不明白的地方，盧先生却全未改正。所以我說的「依據這樣的本子（指許史）而不知取別種本子稍加參校，則其中所有的錯誤是應由盧先生負其責的。』二·上文原是寄給，先生所主編的上海大公報「文史」的，後來見大公報「文史」停刋了，我的文章沒有刋出，我以爲此文也許不會刋出了。其時適逢羅根澤先生向我索稿，又因爲我已經發現了盧先生所根據的是許之衡先生的戲曲史講義，我就把上文加以修改，交羅先生發表於十一月十日南京中央日報的「文史局刋」第六十七期上了。我並非「一文兩投」，有意干犯「編禁」。附此一併聲明。謹此敬祝編祺閭金鍔上（十二月十五日）</p>

<p>唐代河西的沙州在貞元元年（七八五年）淪陷到吐蕃，在大中五年（八五一年）由張義潮收復了，即由張義潮爲歸義軍節度使。傳到姪子淮深兄弟，和姪孫張承奉，在張承奉時曾自稱爲西漢金山國白衣天子。朱梁貞明中（九一五年至九二〇年）張氏的政權，移轉到曹氏。據羅振玉的補唐書張義潮傳（永豐鄉人稿上）和瓜沙曹氏年表（七經堪叢刋修正本），張氏終於張承奉，而曹氏始於曹義金。以後經過曹元德，曹元深，曹元忠，曹延恭，曹延祿，曹宗壽，曹賢順。在宋皇祐四年（一〇五二年）才和中朝斷絕職貢（據宋會要）。又據宋史西夏傳，景祐二年（一〇三五年）西夏已經取瓜沙肅三州。與此稍有不同。統此兩則材料來看，是西夏在景祐二年只取了瓜沙的一部分，未曾取了全部，所以到皇祐四年還會入貢。又據敦煌石室碎金，尙有嘉祐二年（一〇五七年）的殘歷書，這才是現有材料中可以知道的，敦煌中國政權維持到的最後一年。至於是否完全淪陷在這一年，那就不能證明了。</p>
<p>張氏有功於敦煌，政權相繼維持了六十多年。其間曾有一年被張義潮的女壻索勳篡奪過，但終於被張潮的另一女壻李家又轉奪過來交給張氏。至於張曹兩家交替的情形現在便不能明白了。據羽田亨所抄敦焊遺書的張懷慶讚，張懷慶是南陽張氏，和張義潮正是一族。其中有「　王出現，公會同期，毘輔肘腋，近事君威』的話，他的官銜爲「晋故歸義軍應管內衙前都押衙』。（　王應當是曹義金，在榆林窟和莫高窟都自稱托西大王，譙郡是曹氏的郡望。）照此看來，曹家興起之時，還有張家的人做他親信的左右。似乎曹張的交替是在一種和平狀態之中，而非武力的篡奪。</p>
<p>據敦煌遺書的張氏勳德記，張義潮和張義譚都死於長安，義潮無子，義譚子淮深後來承繼義潮，但家中親友大概俱在長安。所以淮深弟某死後，只有一個遺孤，即張承奉（據李氏再修功德碑「兄亡弟喪，社稷淪傾，假手遺孤，幾辛勤於苟免。」又「重光嗣子，再整遺孫」。）張承奉有無嗣子，記載不詳。看各方面的旁證，張承奉似乎並無嗣子，而張懷慶之流則爲疏族。</p>
<p>索勳和李明振都是張義潮的女壻，但索勳被殺，李明振已先死。並且對於張承奉，索李兩代已經不算近親了。淮深的女壻似乎便宜是曹義金的父親。千佛洞第四十二洞北壁另供養人第一人題記爲：</p>
<p>故外王父前河西一十一州節度管內觀察處置押蕃落支度營田等使金紫光祿大夫檢校尙書口口口口口（中缺）萬戶侯賜紫魚袋上柱國（下缺）</p>
<p>又第七十五洞東壁女供養人第八人題記爲：</p>
<p>故外母武威郡夫人陰氏一心供養</p>
<p>而第四十二洞南壁女供養人第三人題記爲：</p>
<p>故（外）王母太夫人武威陰氏</p>
<p>此為曹氏所修的洞，男題記人的官銜爲張氏河西時官銜，而據別處的證據淮深婦爲陰氏，所以淮深爲曹氏的外祖（此據向覺明先生西征小記的抄錄及論證）。因此曹家在張承奉時爲張氏的近親，較索季兩姓爲尤近了。</p>

<h3>鴟夷子皮不是范蠡</h3>
<p>— 王叔岷</p>
<p>淮南子氾論篇有云：昔者齊簡公釋其國家之柄，而專任大臣將相，攝威擅勢，私門成黨，而公道不行，故使陳成田常，鴟夷子皮，得成其難難</p>
<p>錢大昕云：「以鴟夷子皮爲田常之黨，他書所未見。按田常弑君之年，越未滅吳，范　何由入齊？此淮南之誤也。十駕齋養新錄十二）</p>
<p>岷案錢說非也。據史記貨殖列傳云：范　旣雪會稽之恥，乃喟然而歎曰：「計然之策七，越田其五而得意。旣已施於國，吾欲用之家。」乃乘扁舟　於五湖，變名易姓，適齊為　是司馬遷以范蠡爲鴟夷子皮，即錢說所本。但鴟夷子皮非范蠡也。鴟夷子皮黨田常事亦累見於他書。其最早者，如墨子非儒下篇云：</p>
<p>孔丘乃恚怒於景公與晏子，乃樹鴟夷子皮於田常之門。其調孔子樹鴟夷子皮於田常之門，恐係　詞。而田常之門實有鴟夷子皮其人，與淮南所載合，則非誣也。次如韓非子說林上篇云：</p>
<p>鴟荑子皮事田成子，田成子去齊，走而之燕，鴟夷子皮負傳而從，至望邑，子皮曰：「子獨不聞涸澤之蛇乎？澤涸，蛇將徙。有小蛇謂大蛇日：『子行而我國之，人以爲蛇之行者耳，必有殺子者。子不如相銜，負我以行，人必以我爲神君也。」乃相銜負以越公道而行。人皆避之，曰：「神君也。」今子美而我惡，以子為我上客，千乘之君也。以子為我使者，萬乘之卿也。子不如爲我舍人。」田成十因負傳而隨之，至逆旅，逆旅之君待之甚敬，因獻酒肉。</p>
<p>其載鴟夷子皮以田常奔燕事甚詳，則田常之門實有鴟夾子皮其人，可證淮南之說非誤也。次如說苑臣術篇云：</p>
<p>陳成子謂鴟夷子皮曰：何與常也？對曰：君死吾不死，君亡吾不亡。陳成十曰：然子何以爲常？對曰：未死去死，未亡去亡，其有何死亡矣？從命利君調之順，從命病君謂之諛逆命利君謂之忠，逆命病君謂之亂，君有過不諫諍，將危國殞社稷也。有能盡言於君，用則留之，不用則去之，謂之諫。用則可生，不用則死，謂之諍。有能比和同力，率羣下相與　矯君，君雖不安，不能不聽，遂解國之大患，除國之大害，成於尊君安國謂之　。有能亢君之命，反君之事，竊君之軍，以安國之危，除主之辱，攻伐足以成國之大利，謂之弼。故諫諍輔弼之人，社稷之臣也。明君之所尊禮，而　君以為已賊。故明君之所賞，聞君之所殺也。明君好問，聞君好獨，明君上賢使能而享其功，闇君畏賢妬能而滅其業。罰其忠而賞其賊，夫是之謂至　，桀紂之所以亡也。詩　云：曾是莫聽，大命以傾·此之謂也其載鴟夷子皮與田常論「君死不死，君亡不亡」之事甚詳，則田常之門實有鴟夷子皮其人，亦可證淮南之說誤也。又指武篇云：</p>
<p>田成子常與宰我爭。宰我夜伏卒，將以攻田成子，命於卒中曰：不見旌節，毋起。鴟夷子皮開之，吿田成子。田成子因爲旌節以起宰我之卒以攻之，遂殘之也。此載鴟夷子皮與田常攻宰我事，亦可證田常之門實有鴟夷子皮其人也。故凡諸書與淮南所稱之鴟夷子皮，皆非去越適齊之范　。據說苑臣術篇云：</p>
<p>鴟夷子皮曰恃於屈春，損頗爲友。二人者之智足以爲令尹，不敢　其智而委之屈春。</p>
<p>是其人在楚平王之世，與范　判然爲二人，至爲明白。然司馬遷何以稱范　爲鴟夷子皮，亦必有田。據上所引諸書證之，鴟夷子皮實一「多智計疑」之人。或范蠡去越之後曾以鴟夷十皮自比，司馬遷因采之入俾與？</p>
<p>墨子，韓非子，說苑諸書所記，皆可佐證淮南之說。錢氏偶疏翻檢，遂斷淮南　誤。干　一失，上知難免·（三十六年歲暮時客金陵）</p>

<p>自由談</p>
<h3>圍爐譚</h3>
<p>— 何苦</p>
<p>寒冬晚上，呵氣成凍，在伏案久坐之後，調一杯麥乳精捧飲，似乎稍解寒氣。管人句云：「寒夜客來當酒」，此時體騐到了這句詩的意義；吃一杯熱茶，可以使週身溫暖。其實寒夜客來，喝酒何妨，最好是有一隻熊態的火爐，　爐取暖，促膝談天，可說是人生一樂。</p>
<p>火爐中當然以壁爐爲最理想。自己的房間裏原來有壁爐裝置，只因戰爭中年年塵封，烟突已經阻塞，而連年人口迭有增加，作爲一間臥室的條件是愈來愈不够了——成爲一種什錦式的房間。終於爲了想爭取這寸餘隙地，便把壁爐拆除。如今在壁爐地位已經放了一口小櫉，連緬想壁爐之流風餘額都不得了。</p>
<p>前日去友人家，不但案上有天竹臘梅，其旁還有一　可供烘手的炭爐，獸炭融融，一室生春，而房間的樸雅，恰如其份。主人翁殆得平淡之趣乎？生一個炭爐子取暖，在北方或許很普通，但在今日戰火瀰漫下也許是難事亦說不定，若是在今日運輸困難的南方，裝置一個火爐，就非你我咄嗟可辦，因此有炭爐足供烘手，可以說滿足的了。</p>
<p>而最想望的當然是燒着木柴的壁爐。人類在懷想過去，往往可以獲得輕鬆舒適的回憶，我也不能例外：去年冬天，我有好幾次晚上到朋友家中去聚餐，他們家衷原有一隻可用的壁爐，主人劈杉木生火，幾個人　在四周剝否仁瓜子，樹木在燃燒中間有　剝之聲，好像有火星要　爐而出一般，我們幾個人的面孔，全被融融火光映成明朗的淺絳，像嘗到佳釀之後的薄醒；宵深漏永，這晚上是過得很愉快的。西洋人有句成語，「用自己的手劈柴生火，可以使你溫暖兩次，」我想劈柴取暖的環境，要以壁爐爲最上乘，　爐人不但獲得的是溫喛，還可以使你像重墮到「好的舊日子」時代去。</p>
<p>當然在今日哀鴻遍野，途有餓殍的衆華都市裏，我們不希望作過份的享受，能够菜飯飽，布衣喛已非易事。想壁爐取暖，雖然是人生應有的享受，在今日還帶一點奢侈的意味。居安思危，我們能够偶然烘一次獸炭，在此時此地可以算得幸運的了。</p>
<h3>我的愛讀書</h3>
<p>— 津津</p>
<p>人是自私自利的動物，處處愛從「自我」出發。我在這裏寫我的愛讀書，也脫不了自我主義的作祟，在發揮我的「卓見」，也許正是別人心目中的「偏見」或「陋見」吧。</p>
<p>我愛續亞美。魯婉兒（Amy　Lowell）的詩，約翰·杜柏索的小說，散文方面還沒有發現偏愛的作家。</p>
<p>亞美。魯婉兒是美國女詩人，生於二十世紀之初，約在二十餘年前去世。關於她的生平，以前也搜集了一些材料，後來却因變故都散失了。她擅寫情詩，以用制細膩，含意深刻爲其特長。她以女子　密的風格，表達男女之間至上的戀愛。我在北平第一次續到她的作品，接出把她四五冊的詩集，全部續完，南來之後，曾在各書坊及舊書肆覓她的專集，却總是買不到。所能發現的，僅是詩選中的一二首作品吧了。如果我沒有記錯的話，恐怕「金庫詩選」中。也錄入她的傑作</p>
<p>以前，我頗能背誦她的詩，琅琅上口，現在因人事倥偬，大半遺忘了。然而我還記得一篇詩的大意，於此可見她設想的一般。她的詩中說，有這樣一位畫家，在繪一幅太陽的圖畫，然而在戀人來了之後，太陽褪色了。何以呢，原詩沒有說明，我想聰明的讀者們，一定可以猜想到原詩在歌頌戀人的光彩奪目，逋太陽也爲之减色了。</p>
<p>就詩的流別說來，她的作品，可以歸入象徽派的。她對於東方的學問，很有一番修養。嘗在某詩中，提起中國詩聖李白，說他詩中的奇氣，得力於醉後所見的奇境。爲此詩壇第一天才的成名原因，下一註解，不無相當意思也。</p>
<p>提起約翰·杜·柏索（Johm　Dos　Passo），又是我私衷夙仰的小說家，這位洋洋百萬言美國三部曲（第四十二條錢，一九一九，大錢）的作家，在用詞上，在心理分析上，變成了　　的成就。我追隨著書中的人物，同歌同泣，有幾節的描寫使我為之淚下。</p>
<p>約翰氏本人是哈佛大學的榮譽畢業生，曾經參加第一次世界大戰，所著三戰士（Thres　Soldiers），在一九二一年出版，即根據參戰經騐寫成，至今尙率為戰爭文學的圭泉。</p>
<p>除掉我在文藝書籍方面的私淑以外，就筆者的「本行」—經濟學而論，甚愛讀史德華·吉士（Stuaut　Chase）的文章。史氏的筆調，生動而信於熱情，說理透澈而詳細。處處着重「實用」，不尙空談，這是他作品的另一特色。</p>
<p>史氏的學歷是這樣的：早年在麻省理工學院攻預算學及工程學，後至哈佛大學專治經濟學，繼而替私家公司及政府機關，執行會計業務，凡十四年之久，著有人興機器，墨西哥等書，並且時有文章，在美國各流行雜誌上發表。</p>
<p>臨未，我再提出一本書來，書名投機常識（CommonslaseSpecuilation）。是一位署名「局內人）著的，由紐約專講金融的貝匯社（Barrons）出版。道是一本商八寫的書，筆墨並不好，而且有文法不通之處，然而假使讀者先生們對於投機之道，發生興趣，或想在投機這方面，知道一些常識的話，却是値得一讀的·我的最後聲明是：我介紹此書，並不在助長投機之風，反正投機已由當局嚴禁，不再能翻雲覆雨了。</p>
<h3>棄款</h3>
<p>— 道先</p>
<p>人有時是頗健忘的，而有的人竟把他們存在銀行裏的款子都忘記了。美國各銀行巾的這種「棄款」，竟達二億五千萬元之多。甚至看人買了跑爲票，中彩以後，也忘記去　　紐約的居民，在一九四六年中，封存在『死信」中的現款，就有四萬美金之多。這是因爲他們忘記寫了寄信人地址，或寫錯了地址。美國全國有五十萬零七千件包裏，因爲寫錯地址，而無從寄遞。這些包裏中，有名貴的波斯羊皮，十七鑽的手錢，和照相機等。</p>
<p>人們辛勤的工作，以及省食儉用積下了一點錢，存放到銀行中，他們該無論如何也不會忘掉這批存款了。但到一九四五年三月三十一日止，紐約州收到銀行繳來的無主存款達四百七十三萬一千元。紐傑賽州收到八十萬元，坎塔基州約收到四十萬元。</p>
<p>紐約大通銀行最後找到一個女存戶，而她自己却不記得曾踏進過該行的大門。但簽字完全一樣，證明這筆存款的確是她的。</p>
<p>有許多被「遺秦」的存款，是丈夫成妻子秘密存放的，不讓對方知道，而最後他或她自己也把這筆錢忘了。還有一些存款，是有的人在兒童時期存的，大起來忘記了，終其一身也沒有挪動。有的人爲子女存款，等到逝世，却忘記把這筆錢交待淸楚。</p>
<p>美國有三十六州的法律，涉及棄款的問題。如紐約州，存款十五年以上，無人認領，移歸州有。南卡洛里納州規定，存款五年以上無人認領，移作州立大學的基金。明尼索達州的限期則是二十年。</p>
<p>雖然法律嚴格規定處置棄款辦法，而人們仍健忘如故。現在這筆棄款的總數，已經足够　特烏，烏他州，威奧明州，密西西比州，克羅拉多州和阿坎薩斯州的一年經費了。</p>
<p>還有許多人把公用事業，如電話，煤氣，電力等的保證金忘記，許多年累積下來，也是一筆可觀的數目。例如，至一九四六年底止，紐約聯合愛迪生公司，就累積了三百三十五萬元無人　領的押　，結果全都移交給州政府。</p>
<p>有許多人在旅行時，把東西遺忘。紐約普爾曼公司失物招領處，每月在車廂中拾得的東西，平均有五百件，有價值二萬元的珠寶，以及假牙等。</p>
<p>最奇異的健忘事情，發生在跑馬應中。許多人把中彩的馬票扔掉或撕掉，有人買了五號，結果八號馬得先，他把馬票扔掉了，但隔了一下，八號馬被判取消資格，得中的是五號。</p>
<p>又如，有人買二號，但寳票的錯給他三號，結果三號得彩，他以爲自己買的是二號，就一把撕掉了。</p>
<p>最近一次賽馬季終了，紐約州庫收到二十萬元沒有兌現的彩票。</p>
<p>還有人忘記立下遺囑，死後發生許多財產糾莫。</p>
<h3>逍遙花</h3>
<p>— 陳慎言</p>
<p>第六章　禍不單行（四四）</p>
<p>渚　道：「你要鼓起勇氣，不必顧盧，你要想想，若是我和她感情很好，你出來挑　，引誘她離婚，那是不對，現在我兩人感情，壞到如此程度，你去勸說，是為她將來幸福打算，有什麼不可以。」說著，站起來對雲卿深深鞠了一躬道：「你發慈悲，救我兩人吧！」雲卿佯孥道：「你不要胡說八道，我先要問你，你打算和她離婚，是什麼條件？條件好我可以察看情形，試一試，若是條件不好，我才不幹這損德的事！」渚　道：「我可　條件是，一：自她和我離婚後，她的一切生活費仍由我担負，一直到她出嫁爲止。」雲卿道：「她不出嫁，你要負責担任一輩子是不是？」渚齋道：「別忙，我話還沒說完呢！二：離婚後，我二人仍要維持友誼，她有什麼困難，應由我帮忙地方，我盡力帮忙；三：我二人離婚，祇私下彼此簽約了事，不必公布；四：她如需要我交他整筆款項，彼此永斷葛藤，我也可以辦到；五：她如答應我以友誼來往，我仍可以到她那裏談談吃吃飯；六：我的現在住宅和一切傢具，全部贈給她，我的衣服和我一切書籍等等不在內。」雲卿聽了渚齋念出這些條件，又好氣又好笑，問道：「你是鬧着玩，還是眞正要和她離婚？怎麼提出這種不三不四的條件？」渚齋正色道：「我認爲和鳳笙離婚，祇有如此辦法最好，我爲家庭反對離婚，所以此事不願公布，爲將來鳳笙生活問題，才供給她瞻養費，並把住宅和傢具全贈給她，爲免她傷心，所以仍維持友誼，彼此可以常常見面。我這些條件，純爲她設想，沒有一點自私，我和她離婚，並不是有什麼仇恨，完全爲彼此將來的幸福起見，你明白我的意思嗎？」雲卿把嘴一抿道：「你不要說得這樣冠冕堂皇，一個人不爲大不了的事，不會隨便和太太離婚的！」渚齋道：「你這話我不否認，總之我要得她一張離婚證據，免得犯重婚罪，我又不顧引起家庭糾紛，所以才擬定這些條件，你認爲是否妥當，如有不妥，可以修改。」雲卿道：「我不是律師，談不到修改條件，不過你肯給她生活費，給她住宅等等，總算你這人還有良心，沒把她完全拋棄，她腦筋若是清楚，能看清前途，為將來自已幸福打算，這些條件未嘗不可接受。不過，她的思想是否也作如此見解，就不可知了！」渚道齋：「那末，全仗我佛蓮花妙舌，爲我開導開導愚蒙！」</p>
<h3>健忘</h3>
<p>— 毛毅</p>
<p>有一個婦人過慮得神經衰弱。有一天，她與丈夫同在戲院觀劇，突然想起一事，就說：</p>
<p>「噢，約翰，我想起我忘記把電熨斗關熄了，」</p>
<p>她的丈夫聽了亳不在意，輕描淡寫的回答說：「不要發愁，親愛的。我剛巧忘記關掉浴缸裏的自來水龍頭，所以，水火相尅，一點事情也沒有。還是看你的戲罷！」</p>
<h3>劉別謙的成就</h3>
<p>— 平齋</p>
<p>劉別謙之死，不但是好萊塢的損失，世界電影界也失掉了一個無可比擬的瓊寶。世人漸漸已有把好萊塢和低級的大腿戲相提並論的趨勢，其實是非常不公允的，好萊塢的確不乏嚴肅的爲藝術而努力的人們，劉　賺即是其中之一。</p>
<p>現在，任何談電影的人，每逢說到電影與舞合劇不同的時候，最當用的一句說法是：電影使觀衆與演員接近了—因爲電影有特寫鐃頭，演員銜着香烟的嘴角微微一震，或是一個狂喜的少女的睫毛輕輕一動，都可以藉「特寫」之力，使感覺最遲鈍的觀衆也不會忽略掉。在舞台上，你的動作不能不略帶誇張，你的肢體在運用時的幅員不能不較平常更爲擴大—因爲，如果不這樣的話，坐得稍後的觀衆就不能領略你想表達的情緒。即使化裝也一樣，舞台上，你的化裝必須極濃，對比極明顯，而電影則不然。</p>
<p>所以，說舞台與電影間最大的不同之點在於電影有特寫鏡頭，是很有理由的。而劉別謙正是電影界第一個採用了特寫鏡頭的人。換言之，電影上的特寫是劉一別謙發明的。蘇聯的愛森斯坦曾作更進一步的試探，想把「特寫」再擴大一步以求達得「誇張得諷刺」（Caricaturc）的效果，但是顯然他的嘗試未能成功，而旦我們也不能想像Caricaturc在悲劇上能發生多大作用。</p>
<p>劉別謙深切的明瞭電影與戲劇之不同在于離觀衆間距離的長短，因之他的「小動作」是獲得了空前的成就的，這就是所謂劉別謙風」（Lubltshe　touch）。這種小動作，在舞台上是是往往無法發揮的，尤其是比較次要的角色在中後塲上簡直無法表現。可是，在電影中，因爲導演有選擇畫面的自由，即使在一個「中景」中也能表現得淸晣有力。在特寫中自然更不必說了。有人稱這種手法爲「細膩」，但是事實上每一個有藝術良心的導演都在「細膩」地工作着；劉別謙有「開麥拉眼睛」（Camera　eye），一看到某一個輕微的動作可以動人，便抓緊了不放，擴大一下，强調一下。這正和高明的新聞記者必有「新聞眼睛」：第一個要素是必須有藝術家的敏感，第二是要有說身處地爲觀衆（或讀者）着想的一種能力，第三則是在發現了這種精彩塲合時，能充分地發揮然而又加以適當的抑制（最精彩的發揮也就是最嚴格的抑制）。</p>
<p>萊因哈代何嘗不是一位戲劇界宗匠，但他的電影「仲夏夜之夢」正是一個豪奢的浪費，一個才氣續溢的慘敗。癥結很簡單，他幾乎全用中景，他是舞台之王，他忠于舞台—而忽略了電影的特質。</p>
<p>能够和劉別謙頡頏的，祇有法國的勒奈，克萊爾（Rene　Clair）了，也許我該說這位法國大師在處理「故事的轉換」（Transition）時尤勝于劉別謙；在俏皮，幽默各點上則二人彷彿相似。但是，在電影史上毅然脫出了舞台的範疇的，則以劉別謙</p>
<h3>廣告</h3>
<p>— 樂</p>
<p>美國廣吿商本領之高，當然不在話下。但是我們若看看五十年前一張美國報上的廣吿，印象便感不同了，該廣吿云：「睛購全白牌牙粉—該牙粉品質並不比一般牙粉爲高，價格亦並不比一般牙粉爲廉，惟此牙粉係舍姪所製迭，渠年靑有爲，頗知上進，如此類牙粉竟吿暢銷，則　或可藉此利潤而成婚，深望各界多多照顧是幸。」</p>
<h3>再記抄襲</h3>
<p>— 雷克</p>
<p>前爲本刋寫「抄襲」一文，另有一位執敎的朋友看見了，他吿訴我兩件關於抄襲的趣事，値得一記。他是在一個女子中學裏敎書的，所以記的都是女學生的事情。</p>
<p>有一次，這位敎師批閱作文，讀到了一篇極其通順的文章。這個學生字體寫得甚爲工正，看上去自然格外愉快。可是看到將近終篇，忽然看見一句文字，前後固然不連貫本身也奇奧難懂：——「有只白婢」。他想了好一會兒，虧他總算想了出來，原來是一有口皆碑」。這個女生家裏有一個在大學裏念　的哥哥，她將他的課卷抄了寫來，因爲原稿寫得太草率一點，所以把字看錯了。</p>
<p>另外有一件事，値得大書特書，不但可以說明抄製者的將錯就錯，而且可以警告抄襲者難免有中人圈套的危險。這裏所記的不是作文，而是歷史課的考試。在這一班中，有兩個坐在一起的同學，一個是成績極好，一個則喜歡偷一點　，在敎室裏常常談天說地。　　考試，她總不肯用心準備。她還有一個大毛病，就是喜歡偷看旁座的考卷，照樣抄錄。而旁座的女同學，又不好意思不讓她抄。</p>
<p>這一次考試題目裏面，有一個是問佛敎始祖是誰。者試以後，敎師批閱考卷，這兩個同座位的同學，考得極好，題題都對，單是這一個題目，却答得十分突梯滑稽——失脚美女」。若照譯音說，也許不能說錯，然而它究竟有傷大雅。這敎師當然明白其中奧妙。那用功的同學旣無法不讓人抄襲，又不願公開報吿，而老師在考塲上又照顧不周，捉不到賊，於是她就想出這條妙計，擺下了一個陷阱，讓鄰座的文抄公（？）失足跌進來。這樣一來，敎師總不能不發現了，發現以後，更不能視若無略。老師也不作聲，祗在考卷上一個批了九十五分，一個批了零分。抄襲的學生也「識相」，她悶聲不嚮把一個湯　吃了下。這個態度比一般三不買帳的文抄公聰明得多</p>
<h3>偽與假</h3>
<p>— 凌霄漢閣</p>

<h3>Further Developments in the Kowloon Walled City Case: Diplomatic Authorities Express Deep Regret; Executive Yuan Orders Protection of British Consulates and Nationals Nationwide</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 16th] Foreign Minister Wang met with British Ambassador Sir Ralph Stevenson at 4 PM on the 16th to continue discussions from the 15th regarding the Kowloon Walled City incident. Simultaneously, reports were received of the British Consulate and Information Office in Guangzhou being attacked and burned by enraged crowds. The two officials also exchanged views on this matter, both acknowledging that the dispute arising from the Kowloon Walled City had become excessively large and expressing deep regret. To maintain the friendship between China and Britain, this issue must not be allowed to escalate further. The most important matter at present is to swiftly achieve a proper resolution to the case. However, no response from London to our repeated protests has been conveyed to our Foreign Ministry through Ambassador Stevenson. Some individuals believe that the British side bears greater responsibility for the unfortunate incident in Guangzhou, arguing that the Chinese government has exerted every effort to guide the high tide of protest and sentiment, and has repeatedly intensified negotiations with the British side, hoping to find a solution to the problem in the shortest possible time. However, the Hong Kong side acted unilaterally, and London failed to recognize the seriousness of the situation, repeatedly delaying, ultimately leading to this deeply regrettable incident.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 16th] After receiving reports of the British Consulate-General and the Jardine Matheson &amp; Co. in Shamian, Guangzhou, being attacked and burned, Executive Yuan President Zhang Qun convened relevant officials on the 16th and issued instructions, also sending telegrams to provincial and municipal governments, instructing as follows: All illegal acts of violence, regardless of any pretext or reason, should be severely punished according to law. Provincial and municipal officials should urge security agencies to effectively protect the lives and property of British consulates and their nationals in their respective jurisdictions. Failure to do so will result in the assignment of due responsibility. In addition, instructions were given to the Foreign Ministry to actively continue negotiations based on the government's established position and policy regarding the Kowloon incident, to quickly seek a proper solution.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 16th] Director of the Executive Yuan Information Office, Dong Xian Guang, stated on the 16th that the government deeply regrets the unfortunate incident in Guangzhou on the 16th caused by the demonstration.</p>
<h3>Guangzhou Garrison Headquarters Issues Proclamation: Criminals Infiltrated Demonstration Ranks and Committed Violence; Determined to Investigate and Prosecute to Maintain Foreigners' Safety</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Guangzhou, 16th] After the unfortunate incident in Shamian, Guangzhou Mayor Ouyang Ju went to meet the British Consul-General to express his regret, and assured him that the security authorities would jointly protect the safety of British nationals' lives and property.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Nanjing, 16th] The British Embassy in Nanjing has protested to the Chinese Foreign Ministry tonight over the burning or destruction of the British Consulate and other British buildings in Guangzhou, and has requested increased security for the British Embassy in Nanjing.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Guangzhou, 16th] Director Song of the Guangzhou Garrison Headquarters issued a proclamation tonight regarding the unfortunate incident during the demonstration parade: "Regarding the recent forced demolition of civilian residences in Kowloon Walled City, the central government has repeatedly declared that the Foreign Ministry will actively negotiate based on legal standing and the principle of safeguarding sovereignty, seeking a reasonable solution. Local governments and people, motivated by patriotic enthusiasm, have engaged in rights protection movements, which should also await central government disposition and not exceed the bounds of the law. However, at noon today, residents of this city held a demonstration parade protesting the Kowloon Walled City incident. At 2 PM, a portion of the demonstrators broke away from the ranks and rushed into Shamian. Criminals seized the opportunity to infiltrate, burning the British Consulate-General and throwing bricks and stones, injuring foreigners and engaging in extremely hateful and lawless violence. Shamian has already been recovered and belongs to our national territory, and the lives and property of resident foreigners should naturally be equally protected. This act of violence is an extraordinary event. This Director, in order to maintain public order, is determined to investigate and prosecute severely. If such incidents occur again in the future, they will be stopped by force and will not be tolerated. Therefore, this proclamation is issued for all to obey."</p>
<p>[Another Dispatch] After the British Consulate in Shamian was destroyed by the mob, the authorities here expressed deep concern. Chairman Song Ziwen personally expressed condolences to the British Consul and stated that he would do his best to maintain the safety of British nationals. A full curfew has been imposed in Shamian.

The authorities have also strengthened security on the Guangdong-Hong Kong border to prevent any emergencies.</p>
<h3>Accident Occurs During Demonstration Parade: British Consulate in Shamian Burned; Impacts Jardine Matheson, Butterfield &amp; Swire, and Reuters</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Guangzhou, 16th] Various sectors in Guangdong and Guangzhou held a demonstration parade on the morning of the 16th to protest the Kowloon Walled City incident. Over 20,000 people from various sectors gathered upon hearing the news. The demonstration route had originally been temporarily changed to avoid Shamian, to prevent unpleasant incidents. However, as the main column passed Taiping South Road, a group of students and workers first broke through the police blockade and rushed into Shamian. They first tore down the British flag hanging from the British Consulate with iron chains, and broke the flagpole, declaring revenge for the British's humiliation of our national flag in Kowloon Walled City. Subsequently, they climbed onto the roof of the British Consulate and destroyed the interior equipment with stones, etc., and then set fires, around 1 PM. Under the raging flames, the British Consulate and the adjacent British Information Office, Reuters Guangzhou Branch (having just started publishing five days ago), Jardine Matheson &amp; Co., and Butterfield &amp; Swire were instantly reduced to ashes. A portion of HSBC Bank was also affected. The fire was extinguished at 6 PM. The crowd surrounded Shamian, shouting "Down with British Imperialism" and "Recover Hong Kong and Kowloon." At that time, the British Consulate staff had fled one after another. Those who did not manage to leave were escorted away by our military police with strict protection, so no bloodshed occurred. The occurrence of the unfortunate incident in Shamian is generally believed to have been caused by a series of unfriendly actions by the British side.</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper, Guangzhou, 15th] The Kowloon Walled City Incident Support Association, organized by various sectors in Guangdong and Guangzhou, issued a public announcement, stating: "After China's eight years of resistance against Japan, and the lifting of all unequal treaties, today we are once again being persecuted by British imperialism, encroaching on our territory and harming our compatriots. The old hatred of the 'June 23rd' Shamian Massacre remains. We absolutely cannot allow such atrocities to be seen again today. We are always willing to sacrifice everything to defend Kowloon Walled City, recover Kowloon, and recover Hong Kong." Lu Jin, a representative of the Kowloon Walled City disaster victims, arrived in Guangzhou on the 14th and paid a visit to Chairman Song on the 15th to report the details of the tragedy.

Last night, they boarded a train to Nanjing to earnestly petition the central authorities, hoping to convey the heavy voice of the people of the North to the ears of the central government. Due to the pressing expectations of their group, and the intermittent appeals of Shanghai's industrial and commercial sectors over the past month, people can generally feel the increasing severity of the economic crisis, which cannot help but evoke a long-suppressed question in everyone's mind: Is the current government's economic policy one of action? Unity? Or division?</p>
<p>The ten examples listed by the Northern Petition Group and the seven measures they hope for, such as (1) encouraging exports, (2) opening up foreign exchange, (3) restoring production loans, (4) negotiating the purchase of American cotton and wheat, (5) increasing grain and cotton production, (6) implementing coal-for-grain exchanges, etc., are not only major issues related to the livelihood of the people in the North, but also major issues related to the national economy and the people's livelihood of the entire country. Whether these measures can be adopted, and whether the current artificial obstacles can be removed, is the key to whether the national economy can turn from danger to safety in the future. Therefore, we should not regard the success or failure of this petition to Nanjing by the Northern Petition Group as a local matter for the North, but as a matter concerning the overall pacification of the rebellion. We can almost say that this trip by the Northern Petition Group is a touchstone for whether the central government will consider adopting public opinion and changing its economic policies in the future. In essence, what we demand should be an "active" economic policy, not a "stagnant" economic policy; it should be a "unified" economic policy, not a "divided" economic policy. The former is the path to life for the national economy; the latter is the path to death for the national economy!</p>
<p>Stopping production loans, stopping industrial loans, stopping foreign exchange, stopping salt loans, restricting the transport of northern coal to the south, restricting the transport of southern grain to the north, stopping the reclamation of farmland in Hebei, reducing grain and cotton production—these examples listed by the Northern Petition Group all illustrate that the current policy is one of "stagnation" and "division." But what our country urgently needs is "mobilization," "total mobilization," "unity," and "great unity"; to want to mobilize but instead cause stagnation, to want unity but instead promote division, this is truly running in the opposite direction, and there is no stranger thing in the world.</p>
<p>We have long said that the Communists use every means to achieve their goal of destruction. Only by destroying the countryside and making it impossible for farmers to produce, obstructing the circulation of materials, and trapping the country in a state of division, can the Communists drive all the homeless, jobless, and displaced people to become tools for harming the country and destroying the nation. For the sake of saving the country and the people, we must mobilize all manpower, material resources, and financial resources to suppress the bandits and quell the rebellion. We must prescribe the right medicine, and only by using construction to overcome destruction, by using production to overcome annihilation, by using unity to overcome division, and by using mobilization to overcome obstruction, can we unite all the patriotic people's strength to strike at this unprecedented national traitor in history. Therefore, the general key to resolving the current economic crisis lies only in starting from (1) increasing production, (2) circulating materials, (3) guaranteeing employment, and (4) stabilizing society. All government measures and methods that conform to these four major principles are the "active" and "unified" policies that the people hope for. Conversely, if those in charge of major plans have limited vision in economic policy, only focusing on small calculations, only focusing on local calculations, only focusing on temporary calculations, and do not understand how to mobilize and use the people's strength, thinking that they can resolve the economic crisis by using some means of "stopping" or "restricting" something, they will surely regret it too late!</p>
<p>We would like to take advantage of the opportunity of the Northern Petition Group's entry into Nanjing to offer a few superficial views to the senior officials in charge of economic policy, without fearing the criticism of being unpalatable: (1) Economic stability is a prerequisite for political stability; a political system on the right track is a prerequisite for military power. (2) If the Northeast is lost, there will be no North China; if North China is lost, there will be no Central China. (3) The economy is like the blood vessels of the human body, interconnected and flowing at all times, and a slight movement in one part affects the whole body. There is no reason to forcibly obstruct it with human power; once the blood vessels stagnate, they will inevitably wither. If the economy "cuts off flow" for a long time, it may lead to its own collapse. We must loudly proclaim that the current economic phenomenon is extremely imbalanced and extremely dangerous! The North and the South are imbalanced, the countryside and the cities are imbalanced, the common people and the wealthy are imbalanced! Accumulating the consequences of all kinds of imbalances, or allowing them to evolve, will lead to unimaginable consequences for the economic future! What is the way to salvage it? It is;</p>
<p>Change the "stagnant" economic policy to an "active" economic policy!</p>
<p>Change the "divided" economic policy to a "unified" economic policy!</p>
<h3>Yuan Liang Announces at the Price Committee Regarding the Recent Situation of Cotton Yarn and Cloth; Reviews Past Gains and Losses, Explains Control Policies</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Office, 16th Dispatch] Yuan Liang, Chairman of the Cotton Yarn and Cloth Management Committee, attended the eighth meeting of the Price Committee of the National Economic Council at 9:00 am on the 16th, and gave a detailed report on the recent situation of cotton yarn and cloth. Yuan first stated that due to the rampant activities of the Communists, transportation has not been restored, supply and demand are imbalanced, and prices are soaring. The central government has therefore decided to implement controls on important materials to stabilize finance and meet the needs of quelling the rebellion. The recent measures for the management of cotton yarn and cloth are one of the important decisions. Yuan's report is divided into three parts.</p>
<p>The Upward Trend Over the Past Year</p>
<p>(1) The upward trend of cotton yarn and cloth prices over the past year: The rate of increase of the three (cotton, yarn, and cloth) is quite uneven. Taking January 1947 as the base period (100), by December, cotton was 2.011, cotton yarn was 1.300, and cotton cloth was 1134. The rate of increase in cotton was more than 20 times in one year, far higher than general prices, almost approaching the rate of increase in the black market for gold and banknotes. The particularly rapid increase in the price of cotton is due to (A) insufficient domestic cotton supply. It is estimated that the cotton production in 1947 was 1.073 million piculs, but the annual demand for cotton used for hand spinning and folk quilts is 4.5 million piculs. The annual cotton demand for the nation's yarn spindles is more than 10 million piculs, so the cotton supply is insufficient by 5.5 million to 6 million piculs; (B) transportation difficulties. Cotton production in war zones is difficult to transport due to traffic obstruction, so the cotton that could have been supplied to yarn mills must be discounted; (C) reduced imports of foreign cotton. In 1946, the total import of foreign cotton was 6.891 million piculs, including 1.264 million piculs from UNRRA and 5.627 million piculs from imports. In 1947, UNRRA imported 1.401 million piculs, but the import quota for foreign cotton was 80 million US dollars, which could import about 2 million piculs of foreign cotton, totaling 3.401 million piculs, less than half of the import volume in 1946; (D) purchases by all parties in the producing areas. When cotton was put on the market last year, all parties rushed to purchase in areas where transportation was relatively easy. The government did not manage it in advance, resulting in soaring cotton prices, which stimulated the rise in yarn and cloth prices.</p>
<p>Review of Past Regulatory Policies</p>
<p>(2) Review of past regulatory policies: In the past, the Textile Adjustment Committee only focused on cotton yarn and did not comprehensively control the three (cotton, yarn, and cloth), so it could not be effective; past regulatory policies were nothing more than two ends: (A) flexible price negotiation. Because market prices fluctuated too violently, price negotiation was difficult to do. If it was too low from the market price, production would not cover the cost. If it followed the market price, it would stimulate prices; (B) selling banknotes along with materials. This policy, because the government's materials are limited, cannot be sold in large quantities, only having a temporary effect and difficult to sustain. From November 28th last year to the 7th of this month, the amount of yarn sold reached 13.249 pieces, which is quite considerable, but not a fundamental solution.</p>
<p>Future Control Seeks to Be Reasonable</p>
<p>(3) Implementation of future control: The overall control of cotton yarn and cloth in the future lies in maintaining and supporting within the management. The implementation plan for each item seeks to be reasonable. This detailed implementation rule has been agreed upon and is being drafted. The main aim of the management is to appropriately coordinate the entire process of production, manufacturing, transportation, and sales, so that hoarders and speculators have no skills to use. Even if it rises again in the future, it can rise reasonably. From cotton farmers to textile factories, in addition to production costs, they still maintain their legitimate profits. The government manages and assists at the same time, allowing our national capital-accumulated textile industry to enter a prosperous development path. Future control methods are (A) unified purchase of cotton. Entrust the Textile Construction Company and organized cotton merchants to purchase on behalf of the government. The price will be determined by the Management Committee according to the local cost, quality, and transportation situation, and the standard price will be adjusted at any time; (B) processing on behalf of others. Stipulate the standard for converting cotton into yarn and yarn into cloth in kind. All yarn mills (over 3,000 spindles) and cloth mills (over 30 machines) that meet the regulations can process on behalf of others. The calculation standard for processing fees is quite flexible. All finished products are controlled by the Management Committee; (C) reasonable distribution of yarn and cloth. In the past, the quantity of yarn and cloth supply and demand could not be balanced, resulting in it becoming an object of speculation. In the future, the government will control all materials and distribute them reasonably. Most of the cotton yarn, in addition to being handed over to cloth mills for weaving on behalf of others, will be distributed to registered qualified replica factories and their trade associations. The distribution of yarn and cloth to yarn merchants, cloth merchants, and dyeing factories will adopt a bidding method. Users will report the price they are willing to pay and the quantity they are willing to purchase, and apply for distribution. The Management Committee will approve a reasonable price and distribute it separately, so that the supply and demand of yarn and cloth in the future can be appropriately adjusted, without the risk of disconnection.</p>
<p>Production and Distribution Carefully Considered</p>
<p>Yuan's conclusion stated: The Management Committee has comprehensively considered how to fully supply raw cotton, how to stabilize cotton prices, how to expand yarn and cloth production, and how to distribute reasonably. It is committed to the normal development of this national industry, the practical guarantee of the national economy and the people's livelihood, and the effective implementation of the central government's wartime economic measures. According to Yuan, the standard for converting cotton into yarn is 712.5 pounds of cotton for one piece of yarn, of which 453 pounds are given to cotton and the remaining 259 pounds are converted into legal currency for payment. The labor cost is calculated according to the index. The abstract tube standard for weaving cloth from yarn used to be 24 to 28 pieces of cloth for one piece of yarn, including the labor cost, which is still being implemented.</p>
<h3>I Allow Church Special Plane to Fly to Laohekou to Evacuate Missionaries; St. Paul Flies from Zhengzhou to Shanghai</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] The Lutheran Church officially announced yesterday: The Chinese Air Force has now allowed the church's special plane, St. Paul, to land at the Laohekou military airport once to transport about 40 American and Norwegian missionaries from the area. Since three missionaries were killed by bandits in northern Hubei, the Lutheran Church has repeatedly negotiated with the Chinese Air Force authorities, hoping that St. Paul could go to Laohekou to undertake evacuation work. The military situation in the area is very tense, and fierce fighting is taking place 25 miles northeast of the city.</p>
<p>[Further Dispatch] The church's special plane, St. Paul, flew from Zhengzhou to Longhua Airport in this city on the evening of the 15th, carrying the wife of the director of the Southern Church Hospital, Ayers, and the missionary couple Harris. All three are members of the Baptist Church (an organization within Christianity). St. Paul flew back to Hankou yesterday morning. If there are no accidents, it will go to Zhengzhou again this morning to carry out the work of airlifting hospital equipment and medical personnel. According to Harris's statement to reporters: We have been away from our country for a long time and long for our hometown. We will take a boat back to the United States in the near future. From my observations, although the bandits are very rampant in the Zhengzhou-Kaifeng area, they do not have the strength to occupy the two cities. However, the Longhai Railway has been cut off for a long time, and the food and materials in the nearby counties have been looted by the bandits and must also supply the large army, resulting in a very serious economic situation, especially the food situation in Kaifeng.</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 16th Dispatch] The State Department announced last night: Due to the growing anti-foreign sentiment in areas threatened by the Chinese Communists, it has ordered American missionaries in the area to evacuate as soon as possible.</p>
<h3>Downsizing of Various Agencies: Executive Yuan Orders Subordinates to Draft Implementation Measures</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Office, 16th Dispatch] The measures for downsizing central government agencies were passed by the Executive Yuan Council some time ago. The Executive Yuan has now issued orders to its subordinate agencies to comply and implement them, and the heads of each agency are immediately drafting implementation measures. According to the principles of downsizing, starting from February of this year, the number of employees will be reduced by 5% each month. After five months, it can be reduced to three-quarters of the number of employees before the month. The implementation measures drafted by each agency are to allocate the 5% of personnel that should be reduced each month. According to relevant sources: After the government decided to adjust the treatment of public employees, a huge amount of money will be added to the financial budget. The authorities, while stabilizing the living conditions of public employees, also take into account the country's financial budget, so there is a move to downsize. If the implementation measures can be realized as scheduled, the increased expenditure will not be too large.</p>
<h3>New Method for Paying Workers in Central Agencies: Divided into Two Parts, Technicians and Laborers</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Office, 16th Dispatch] It is learned that the Executive Yuan has decided on a method for paying workers in central government agencies, which is roughly divided into two parts, technicians and laborers. The standard for technicians is a base salary of 20 yuan to 60 yuan, and the standard for laborers is a base salary of 6 yuan to 18 yuan. The method of gradually reducing living allowances each month in the Executive Yuan's approved measures for improving the treatment of public employees is to stipulate that agencies should downsize, and each agency will not increase expenses after deducting salaries. Those that are insufficient will be compensated by downsizing.</p>

<p>[Central News Agency, Tianjin, 16th Dispatch] The Tianjin Financial Management Bureau has been actively investigating the accounts and deposits and loans of various banks and firms in recent days, and closely monitoring the difference in their bill exchange. It has achieved the practical effect of financial management. Various banks and firms are extremely cautious about their internal business.

<h3>Tianjin's Export Foreign Exchange Purchase of Grain: Expected to Be Realized After Consultation</h3>
<p>[Our Tianjin Office, 16th Dispatch] The plan for Tianjin to purchase grain with export foreign exchange is expected to be realized. According to a telegram from Secretary-General Liang Ziqing, who went to Nanjing, Wu Dingchang and Xu Paiyuan have expressed their assistance in promoting the Tianjin foreign exchange purchase of grain plan. According to estimates by Tianjin traders, the local products exported from Tianjin from February to April can be exchanged for 10 million US dollars, which is enough to purchase 1.1 million bags of large flour.</p>

An experienced rice transportation staff told a reporter from the Central News Agency that it usually takes 18 working days to load 9,000 metric tons of grain into a sea-going vessel at the port here, but the Chinese "Hai Xuan" completed the loading in only 6 working days, which shows the amazing efficiency of China's commercial shipping.</p>
<h3>Sharp Decline in Production and High Prices in the Northeast: Who is to Blame? People's Livelihood Declines Further Under Communist Interference</h3>
<p>[United Press, Shenyang, 15th Dispatch] Repeated attacks by the Communists have reduced the farmland in the areas controlled by the Northeast National Army to 5% of the total area. The general industrial level has also fallen to a new low. The number of kilometers of railways open to traffic is very few. The production of electricity and coal has been greatly reduced, resulting in a shortage of various necessities. For the past two and a half months, imports and exports in the Northeast have virtually come to a complete standstill. The main imports used to be cotton, cloth, flour, cotton yarn, and cigarettes. Currently, American cigarettes sell for 160,000 yuan per pack. Even if the Communists stop attacking the Ping-Shen Railway, the repair work will take at least two months. Only the coal-producing areas of Fushun and Benxi still have railway connections with Shenyang. The workers in Fushun are not in good spirits because their income is not enough to have a full meal. Engineers in the area earn only the equivalent of 15 US dollars per month, and the income of workers is certainly even lower. The lack of electricity has greatly reduced the production of yarn mills. Only 25,000 spindles are operating in the areas controlled by the National Army. The lack of electricity and raw materials has caused paper, cement, and other smaller industries to cease operations. The price index in December last year, compared with ten years ago, was 22.222 times for food, 21.343 times for clothing, 4.167 times for rent, and 24.260 times for fuel. Currently, 55,000 yuan, 70,000 yuan for flour, and 100,000 yuan for sugar. 320,000 yuan per piece of local cloth, and 5.3 million yuan per ton of coal.</p>
<h3>Anshan Iron and Steel Plant: Production Halted</h3>

The manager of the factory, Shao Yizhou, spoke of the depression in Anshan, making people feel sorry for the future of China's heavy industry. The factory has been besieged for a long time, and production has been forced to halt.</p>

<h3>Full Text of Draft Implementation Measures for the Financial Portion of the Economic Plan</h3>
<p>(Continued from yesterday)</p>
<p>B. Control of Tax Sources</p>
<p>A. Direct Taxes: Zi. Vigorously implement a general survey of industry and commerce and registration of the business premises of independent professionals to facilitate control of taxpaying units. Chou. Offer the highest possible withholding reward to encourage timely withholding of taxes. Yin. Increase penalties; impose heavier penalties on taxpaying units that fail to declare or conceal their income and overdue taxes. Mao. Request judicial authorities to establish a special tax court or appoint dedicated judges to ensure swift and effective handling of tax cases.</p>
<p>B. Commodity Tax: Zi. Shorten the price assessment period. Under the current commodity tax regulations, the average market wholesale price over three months is used to determine the tax-inclusive price and tax amount. It is proposed to revise this to use the average wholesale price of the most recent month as the basis for determining the tax-inclusive price and tax amount, so that tax revenue can better reflect actual price fluctuations. Chou. Improve tax assessment methods: The current method requires price fluctuations of 25% before the tax amount can be adjusted. It is proposed to revise this to allow adjustments when price fluctuations reach 20%.</p>
<p>C. Customs Duties: Zi. Strengthen investigation and enforcement capabilities. Directly negotiate with the U.S. Navy to purchase sixteen minesweepers and one hundred and thirty various motorboats, which will be converted, equipped with weapons, and fitted with wireless telegraphs for use by various customs stations. Naval vessels will also be transferred, customs officers will be assigned to vessels to investigate and intercept smuggling by vehicles and people, and customs police will be rigorously trained, their numbers expanded, and dispatched to South China to perform their duties. Chou. Actively pursue negotiations. Request the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to continue negotiating with the Hong Kong government on customs matters, to implement anti-smuggling measures within Hong Kong's territory, and request the Ministries of Finance and Communications to jointly draft measures for customs inspection of railway passengers and goods, to coordinate with anti-smuggling efforts. Yin. Investigate civilian inducement flights to prevent smuggling via air transport. Mao. Strictly establish penalty measures. It is proposed to submit a special anti-smuggling law to the Executive Yuan to severely punish smugglers.</p>
<p>D. Salt Tax: Zi. Sufficient production areas. Standardize tax rates, tighten sales areas, and in the future, concentrate as many police units as possible in the production areas to strengthen control of salt fields and eliminate private leakage. Chou. Establish a supplementary collection line: For smuggled salt in the Communist-controlled areas, a temporary inspection and supplementary collection line will be established near the Communist-controlled areas, taxes will be supplemented, and sales will be released. Tax reductions will be made in the areas long disturbed by the Communist bandits in Eastern Shandong and Northern Shaanxi.</p>
<p>C. Improvement of Tax Collection Procedures</p>
<p>A. Direct Taxes: Zi. Advance the payment of business income tax, to be paid semi-annually. To facilitate tax assessment, the tax amount for the entire previous year will be halved, and then adjusted based on the price index to calculate the increased amount for payment. Chou. Clearly stipulate that withholding agents are responsible for paying the second, third, fourth, and fifth categories of income tax, to clarify responsibility and prevent evasion.</p>
<p>B. Commodity Tax: Simplify the cigarette tax collection method. Implement graded taxation on a trial basis, classifying cigarettes into nine grades based on their price and quality to determine the tax amount to be collected, to avoid the trouble of individual evaluation.</p>
<p>C. Customs Duties: Zi. Refer to the "International Convention on the Simplification of Customs Formalities" and simplify and facilitate all necessary customs procedures as much as possible. Chou. Utilize the coastal and border customs agencies to collect commodity taxes and implement laws and regulations related to import and export, such as prohibition of transportation and foreign exchange settlement.</p>
<p>D. Salt Tax: Zi. Collect tax at the warehouse and release salt at designated locations. For all edible salt nationwide, except for salt sold locally and salt sold by ticket, and salt transported between regions by individual merchants, which should still be handled, the salt authorities will raise funds to purchase salt from salt fields, transport it to important distribution hubs in the sales areas, store it in warehouses, determine the warehouse price, collect tax at the warehouse, and release the salt for sale. This will solve the difficulty of merchants raising funds, stabilize salt prices, and increase national treasury revenue. Chou. Centralized management. The location for warehousing should be based on the principle of using the originally established important distribution hubs in the sales areas, with official warehouses available for supply, to facilitate centralized management and save expenses.</p>
<p>Original Plan (5) Enemy and puppet properties and surplus materials should be sold quickly, and state-owned enterprises that do not need to be operated by the government should be sold to private enterprises by issuing stocks or other means.</p>
<p>Implementation measures:</p>
<p>A. Handling of enemy and puppet properties</p>
<p>Proceed with acceleration according to the "Measures for Accelerating the Handling of Enemy and Puppet Properties" and the implementing rules, and formulate steps for implementation within a limited time according to the following methods. Zi. Divide the country into several regions and assign personnel to supervise business, audit revenue and expenditure, and ensure that income from the handling of enemy and puppet properties is quickly remitted to the treasury. Chou. Avoid retention by various agencies as much as possible, and adopt the principle of paying the current price to reduce transfers. Yin. For enemy and puppet properties occupied by military agencies, please have the Executive Yuan send personnel to lead those appointed by the Ministries of Finance and National Defense to conduct on-site inspections in various places, handle them practically according to needs.</p>
<p>B. Handling of surplus materials</p>
<p>Surplus materials from the US military should be handled expeditiously. Except for materials available for construction and applied for by government agencies, other materials should be sold off quickly or entrusted to merchants for consignment sales, as follows: Zi. Step up the transfer of surplus materials. Those issued by the government should be quickly allocated according to category and use, and prioritized for requisition by the original applying agencies. Simplify the requisition and issuance procedures and the procedures with the syndicate to prevent material decay and reduce their utility. Chou. All materials should be based on the principle of paying cash for delivery. When various agencies apply for requisition, they often request off-budget transfers or transfers at the original price when the contract was signed with the United States, and expand the scope of appropriated materials. In the future, these should be deducted from their original and additional budgets, and the scope of transfers should be tightened. Other materials will be sold at market prices and the proceeds will be remitted to the treasury. Yin. Accelerate the processing of materials to be auctioned. Daily necessities and vehicle parts that can be sold off in the short term should be entrusted to merchants for consignment sales. Items other than those requisitioned by agencies may be purchased by foreign merchants paying in foreign exchange to increase foreign exchange reserves. Damaged items will be sold at auction, and the reserve prices of various types of materials will be assessed in advance and sold publicly. Mao. Select and purchase the mechanical materials and materials not shipped from the islands in the Western Pacific by the United States at island prices, obtaining foreign exchange and saving transportation costs.</p>
<p>C. Sale of state-owned enterprises</p>
<p>To convert state-owned production enterprises to private management, determine the method of transfer based on the nature and current status of each state-owned enterprise, as follows: Zi. Sell off in full. The competent authorities should quickly assess the total assets of state-owned enterprises such as the China Textile Company and sell them to private management. Chou. Issue shares. The competent authorities should set a deadline and quickly estimate the total value and issue shares for all state-owned enterprises available for private management and sell them publicly. Yin. Hold auctions. The competent authorities should quickly estimate the auction price based on the market price and business conditions of some state-owned enterprises and sell them off as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Original Plan (6) Promote the issuance of public bonds to absorb idle funds to compensate for the shortfall in fiscal revenue.</p>
<p>Implementation measures:</p>
<p>A. Domestic debt raising</p>
<p>(Zi) The issuance methods of the two types of bonds, the 36-year short-term treasury bills and the US dollar bonds, should be improved. Short-term treasury bills were originally sold based on the central bank's US dollar exchange rate, but since the foreign exchange management measures were revised, they will continue to be sold based on the designated bank's listed market price for the US dollar. US dollar bonds were originally intended to be purchased with US dollars and other foreign currencies and gold, but the British pound has fallen in price and cannot be exchanged everywhere. They should be temporarily changed to be purchased with US dollars.</p>
<p>(Chou) Launch a nationwide campaign to encourage wealthy people to purchase bonds, and the Ministry of Finance should consult with relevant agencies to conduct a rigorous investigation of the sales targets. Leaders from the party, government, military, and all walks of life should be the first to purchase bonds to set an example. After overseas depositors declare their deposits, formulate measures to promote bond purchases to expand sales. (Yin) Launch a bond purchase campaign among overseas Chinese, and the Ministry of Finance should consult with relevant agencies to use propaganda methods to solicit donations. When necessary, the competent authorities may send personnel to assist in various places overseas. (Mao) First allow foreign currency bonds to be listed and traded on the exchange, use public bond policies to regulate the financial market, (Chen) Plan to continue issuing new bonds worth 300 million US dollars at an appropriate time, improving the conditions as much as possible to facilitate sales.</p>
<p>B. Borrowing of foreign debt</p>
<p>(Zi) Coordinate with the currency system reform plan and consult with foreign governments to order large loans to serve as preparation. (Chou) Coordinate with the economic construction plan, consult with various ministries and commissions to formulate plans, and contact the US Export-Import Bank and the International Bank to borrow loans to promote construction and increase production. (Yin) When restoring the repayment of foreign debt, consult to improve the repayment conditions to reduce the burden.</p>
<p>Original Plan (7) Prioritize allowing the purchase of foreign exchange from the Central Bank with gold for the purchase of permissible imported goods.</p>
<p>Implementation measures:</p>
<p>See the financial portion for details.</p>
<p>Original Plan (8) Based on the needs of national construction, determine the abolishment of agencies. Agencies that are too large must be streamlined, and agencies with redundant functions must be merged.</p>
<p>Implementation measures: (A) For all military and political agencies and their state-owned enterprise agencies and affiliated agencies, those with the same nature and business should be merged separately and assigned to the more closely related competent authorities. The Executive Yuan will organize a group to discuss and implement this within a limited time. (B) The number of general affairs, personnel, accounting, and statistics personnel in business agencies should be reduced as much as possible, to a maximum of 30% of the number of business personnel. (C) The collection fees of tax agencies should be reduced as much as possible and the ratio of revenue to expenditure should be stipulated. Those whose expenses exceed the ratio should be abolished or merged. (To be continued)</p>

<h3>Britain and Iraq Formally Sign 20-Year Treaty of Alliance, Stipulating Methods of Military Cooperation Between the Two Sides</h3>
<p>[United Press, London, 15th] Britain and Iraq today signed a 20-year treaty of alliance, under which Britain can immediately secure military bases and dispatch British troops to Iraq in the event that either country "becomes involved in war or is threatened by war." Under the treaty, a "British-Iraqi Defense Council" will be established to coordinate United Nations strategy, command and direct Iraqi forces, and to arrange annual training exercises involving British and Iraqi air forces. Britain also relinquishes its previous right to garrison troops in Iraq during peacetime and to interfere in Iraq's foreign policy.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Portsmouth, 15th] British Foreign Minister Bevin and Iraqi Prime Minister Jamil al-Madfai today signed the new Anglo-Iraqi treaty, which replaces the 1930 Anglo-Iraqi treaty, in Portsmouth. Before signing, Bevin stated that "this treaty is the beginning of several similar treaties, all of which demonstrate Britain's friendship with the Arab world." Madfai replied that the treaty shows that both Britain and Iraq are willing to coexist as free and equal allies and friends. "In today's turbulent world, this treaty can enable the world to work together for international peace and prosperity." Bevin also said that "we have revised all the points that could be criticized in the old treaty. The new treaty was chosen to be signed in Portsmouth because the Iraqi delegation wanted to see the British naval facilities and docks." In addition to reaffirming the Anglo-Iraqi alliance, one of the most important articles is Article 3, which stipulates mutual assistance in wartime and the methods of mutual assistance, which are detailed in the treaty's military annex. It states that when one of the treaty countries is involved in war or feels threatened by war, Iraq will ask Britain to immediately send the necessary troops and transport all weapons to Iraq, and the Iraqi King will provide Britain with all facilities within Iraqi territory, including transportation equipment, on financial terms equal to those applicable to the Iraqi army. The annex also stipulates that Britain will continue to train the Iraqi air force and army, and will continue to supply the Iraqi army with modern weapons in accordance with current methods. The British army also has the right of transit in Iraq during peacetime, and the British government will transfer its wartime military facilities in Basra to Iraq free of charge. An exchange of letters between Britain and Iraq also stipulates that Britain will provide Iraq with economic and social assistance.</p>
<h3>Anglo-American Combined Zone Takes Active Steps to Restore German Foreign Trade, General Clay Issues Report on German Governance</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Berlin, 15th] General Clay's (Commander of the US Occupation Zone) November 1947 Report on German Governance was released today, in which he strongly emphasized that the Anglo-American Combined Zone is able to and must play an important role in the general European recovery mission. The report states that the Anglo-American Combined Zone has taken active steps to formally launch import and export trade with the sixteen European countries. With the exception of Britain and the Soviet Union, the only European countries that have not yet established trade agreements with the Combined Zone are Portugal, Spain, and Romania.</p>
<p>To restore export trade and complete export targets, an international exchange rate for the Mark should be set to establish satisfactory trade relations between the Combined Zone and Europe and the rest of the world. Before the war, one-sixth of the total foreign trade was accounted for by the Eastern European countries of Czechoslovakia, the Balkans, Poland, Finland, and the Soviet Union. Germany, especially West Germany, has always been an integral part of the Western European economy. Even now, when the economic level of West Germany is low, Ruhr coal and coking coal are still supplied in large quantities to France, Austria, the Netherlands, Belgium, and the Scandinavian countries. Without Ruhr coal, the situation would be worse today. If the Marshall Plan for European Recovery can be implemented as scheduled, then by 1949 and 1950, the Combined Zone will be able to supply more materials to other European countries. Within five years, the Combined Zone's exports to European neighbors can exceed imports.</p>

<p>[Reuters, London, 15th] A Foreign Office spokesman said: The Foreign Office has no reason to doubt the veracity of the rumor that the Communist International Information Bureau issued "Plan M" to the Communist Party in the Ruhr area to undermine the Marshall Plan.

<p>[United Press, Berlin, 15th] More than 100,000 workers in three cities in the Ruhr area have been ordered to go on strike on the 16th.

During this time, we have diligently worked for the stability and improvement of the people's lives. However, due to the severe economic difficulties following the defeat in the war, our policies have not been implemented as desired, which is regrettable."</p>
<p>"However, to rebuild the collapsing economy, there is no other way than to rely on the strength of the democratic forces centered on the Socialist Party. Since I formed the cabinet, I have been in charge of the political situation from the standpoint of the working class. While I must seek the implementation of socialist policies, I intend to do so through peaceful means of democracy. Although there has been various criticisms of the current cabinet, I am willing to accept legitimate criticism. However, things have an order and a limit. I hope that all party members will demonstrate the spirit of trust and friendship between comrades and give their full support."

<h3>Back to the Netherlands</h3>
<p>— By Our Special Correspondent Mao Shuqing</p>
<p>(Hague Dispatch) Before the war, there were two peaceful and happy sister countries on the coast of Western Europe, one was Belgium, and the other was the Netherlands. After six years of war, Belgium has not only restored its pre-war prosperity, but also, because it possesses the vast African "Congo" colony, which produces large amounts of "uranium" ore, has now become the second richest country in the world after the United States. Today, when the Dutch think of Belgium, they often express envy from the bottom of their hearts, and at the same time, they feel sadness from the bottom of their hearts!</p>
<p>The East Indies dispute was a fatal blow to the Netherlands after the war. "100,000 troops" are now trapped in Java and Sumatra. As long as the state of war continues, the supply of raw materials from the former colonies and the market for industrial goods cannot be restored. According to unofficial estimates from The Hague: the Dutch government's initial military costs for the Indonesian war, the heavy tax burdens, the shortage of materials, and the reduction in transportation capacity are all enough to deepen the Netherlands' current predicament. The current Prime Minister, Dr. Beel of the Catholic Party, once stated in the Lower House of the Dutch Parliament: as long as the Indonesian problem can be resolved "quickly and cleanly", no matter what the conditions of the resolution, including any price, it would always be good for improving the current situation in the Netherlands! Therefore, not long after Dr. Beel took office, he hurriedly risked his life and flew to the East Indies!</p>
<p>I arrived in The Hague five days before Christmas last year, shortly after Prime Minister Beel flew away from the Netherlands. Mr. Mu'er, the head of the press office of the Dutch Ministry of Foreign Affairs, sent me a copy of the Prime Minister's face-to-face conversation before his departure, the gist of which was: the Dutch government is determined to achieve a rational solution to the Indonesian dispute, so as not to allow the situation in the East Indies to deteriorate further, "but if the government of the Republic of Indonesia acts blindly, then the Dutch government will not hesitate to make all sacrifices to fight for justice and order." At that time, many officials in The Hague did believe that the current government would take a tougher policy, but some Dutch friends told me: the Netherlands' position can no longer continue to "fight" down. The Netherlands attaches more importance to the economic aspects of the East Indies than to the political aspects. As long as the Dutch government continues to maintain special economic rights in Indonesia, the Dutch government can make even greater concessions politically, which is not a concern.</p>
<p>Regarding the two opinions, I sympathize with the latter. Because I am confident that I understand the character of the Dutch quite well. Two years and five months ago, not long after Nazi Germany surrendered, I had been to the Netherlands. At that time, it was not long after liberation, and everything was in chaos, but the excitement and revelry of the Dutch were far above that of the French and Belgians. At that time, I was still a "war correspondent", living in the headquarters of the Canadian Army in "Utrecht", the fourth largest city in the Netherlands. I met, saw, and talked with many Dutch people every day. From the common English they spoke, I knew that the Dutch often revealed an excessive "sense of self-esteem". In Chinese slang, the Dutch often "care too much about face". Sometimes, it can even surprise the most face-conscious Chinese.</p>
<p>Other Europeans call the Dutch a "cold-blooded nation". I remember more than two years ago, at the residence of Mr. Zhang Guoshu, a leader of the overseas Chinese community in The Hague, I met a scholar of Oriental languages who called himself a "China expert". He said that the Dutch are called the "Chinese of Europe" and that the philosophy of the Dutch is similar to that of China. He even strongly compared Spinoza, the great philosopher who grew up in the Netherlands, to Confucius of China. This time, I did not talk to Zhang Guoshu about this person, but my impression of the Dutch is still the same as it was more than two years ago. The Dutch are not as serious and cold-blooded as the Chinese, but in many places, they are indeed learning from the British in every way.</p>
<p>English in the Netherlands is almost as common as the Dutch national language. In fact, German and Dutch are very similar. We speak Dutch, but we only use English when absolutely necessary. Germany was defeated, and speaking German in the Netherlands is more or less considered an "indecent" thing. A friend told me that in the Dutch national anthem, there is a sentence that says: "We are proud because we have the blood of the Germanic nation," but the Dutch are absolutely unwilling to mention this matter. I know that it is an impolite act to peel the "sore" of a person who cares about face.</p>
<p>But, in any case, the Netherlands is still a "land of culture and artifacts". Living in this small country of more than nine million people, there is a feeling of elegance and kindness everywhere. General Jiang Dingwen came to the Netherlands on New Year's Eve and praised the cleanliness of The Hague. In winter, the temperature hovers around freezing, but you can see exotic flowers and plants everywhere in the Netherlands. Blood-red roses, bright peonies, and even all kinds of plum blossoms, orchids, chrysanthemums, and bamboos. Many Dutch people are often proud of their "floral world", but I think what they can be even more proud of is more than this.</p>
<p>The story of "Jingwei filling the sea" in Chinese history has been fully realized in the Netherlands. No other country can match the Dutch engineers' control over seawater. In the Dutch Ministry of Economic Affairs, there is still a historical map hanging, showing that during the ancient Roman Empire, the Netherlands was all low-lying lake areas. The geographical Netherlands of today has been gradually filled up since the 16th and 17th centuries. The English word "Netherlands" means low-lying wetlands. Even now, 40% of the land in the Netherlands is lower than the sea level at high tide. 25% of the land is absolutely below sea level.</p>
<p>Looking at this aspect, the Dutch people's achievement of "conquering nature" is worthy of special mention. They not only built embankments in the lowlands, but also filled in several corners of the "Zuiderzee". On December 28, 1925, Dutch engineers completed the dike at the mouth of the "Zuiderzee", blocking the waves of the North Sea. Then, the land reclamation work of "Wieringermeer" was completed, and the former blue waves of the sea turned into beautiful pastoral land.</p>
<p>Seventeen days before the liberation of the Netherlands in 1945, on the morning of April 17th, the commander-in-chief of the German army stationed in the Netherlands ordered the Dutch residents of "Wieringermeer" to evacuate quickly. Then, at 12:15 noon, the dam was breached, and the tide poured in. That unprecedented catastrophe was a groundbreaking event in Dutch history. The loss of people, livestock, cattle, and sheep was incalculable. Today, the Dutch still gnash their teeth when they talk about the German army, just as we recall the Japanese robbers breaching the Yellow River in 1938. But the spirit of the Dutch is still admirable. On the third day after the Nazi defeat, the Dutch dike repair project immediately began, and the closing project was completed in just three months.</p>
<p>Mr. Pu Xi of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs Press Office told me many stories of "water control". He said that the Dutch government is now planning to fill in the southwestern part of the "Zuiderzee", reducing the area of the existing Zuiderzee by half. Once this plan is realized, the country can add at least 500,000 acres of arable land, and the Netherlands' valuable agricultural products are expected to more than double.</p>
<p>More than two years ago, when I came to the Netherlands, because I was just passing through in a hurry, I did not visit the embankment. This time, despite the severe winter, I still braved the wind and rain and took a trip to the northwest coast of the Zuiderzee. My simple impression reminded me of the TVA water conservancy project in Tennessee, USA. The TVA is to prevent flood surges in the plateau mountains, while the Zuiderzee water conservancy project is to prevent seawater intrusion. Although the structure and construction of the two are completely different, they both have a close connection with China in terms of water control.</p>
<p>Today, many countries around the world send students to study water conservancy engineering here. I heard that two Chinese students were also sent to The Hague last year. Unfortunately, because I was too rushed for time, I did not visit the Dutch National University of Technology, which is known for its water conservancy. (January 7, Hotel de Zalm, The Hague)</p>

<h3>Banquet for North China Delegation by Newspaper Industry, Explanation of Petitioning in Nanjing, Earnest Hope for Central Government to Quickly Support Industrial Production Increase, Smooth Circulation of Grain and Coal, and Restoration of Production Loans</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper's Report] The North China Petition Delegation, consisting of Liu Yaozhang, Speaker of the Hebei Provincial Temporary Council; Xu Huidong, Speaker of the Beiping Municipal Council; Shi Zizhou, Speaker of the Tianjin Municipal Council; and Li Zhushu and Ji Dianchuan, representatives from the industrial and commercial sectors, a total of five individuals, arrived in Shanghai on the 14th. They paid visits to Mayor Wu and President Zhang for discussions. Originally scheduled to travel to Nanjing by train on the evening of the 15th, the trip was postponed due to unforeseen circumstances until the evening of the 16th. In Nanjing, they will separately visit Chairman Chiang, President Zhang, and the heads of relevant ministries and commissions to present reports on the crisis in North China, requesting prompt solutions.</p>
<p>Speaker Liu Yaozhang and others, on the afternoon of the 16th, accepted an invitation from Mr. Liu Yizhi of Yi Shi Bao and Mr. Cao Gubing of Da Gong Bao to attend a banquet hosted by the press. During the banquet, they explained the purpose of their petitioning in Nanjing and detailed the suffering endured in North China, appealing to the Shanghai press for assistance in jointly conveying the importance of North China to the central government. After Speaker Liu's address, Mr. Pan Gongzhan, Director of this newspaper, Mr. Qi Jianzhong, Director of Southeast Daily, and Mr. Wang Yunsheng, Editor-in-Chief of Da Gong Bao, delivered speeches successively, unanimously urging the government to pay attention to the economic crisis in North China and to devise solutions as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Speaker Liu pointed out that the people of the Yellow River basin and the Yangtze River basin are closely interconnected. Currently, North China is experiencing a grain shortage, while Shanghai is facing a coal shortage. This illustrates the close relationship between the two regions. How to strengthen the transportation of coal from the north to the south and grain from the south to the north in the future is an urgent issue. The seriousness of the situation in North China is more economic than political, and more political than military, with all three being intertwined. This delegation, representing tens of millions of compatriots in North China, is petitioning primarily on economic grounds, hoping that the central government will continuously support increased industrial and agricultural production, smooth the flow of grain, and facilitate the circulation of currency. The central government is undoubtedly concerned about this, but unfortunately, there are still areas where the spirit is not fully penetrating, so we have come south to present a detailed account to the central government for consideration. Here are a few simple examples.</p>
<h3>Export Goods Piling Up and Rotting, Mining Equipment Unable to Be Replenished</h3>
<p>Tianjin's exports account for approximately 12% of the national total, but the allocation of foreign exchange for imports is less than 4%. As a result, export goods are piling up and rotting on the one hand, while the equipment for various factories and mines cannot be replenished on the other. Tianjin has always had a trade deficit with Shanghai, so when the Shanghai foreign exchange ceased, two phenomena immediately occurred: first, the exchange rate soared, stimulating prices; second, cash was transported for import, and capital flowed south. The flow of capital southward has been continuous, and last August, it was rumored to be as high as 800 billion (including transfers from areas other than Beiping and Tianjin). As a result, the regular turnover in Beiping and Tianjin is only 300-400 billion, with Beiping having less than 100 billion, which is less than that of a single bank in Shanghai. The anemia is worsening. After the suspension of production loans, Huaxin, Hengyuan, and Beiyang textile mills have already reduced working hours and laid off employees. Of the three Shoufeng flour mills, only one is operating. Small and medium-sized factories, such as the soap industry, have only 23 of 54 factories in Tianjin operating. The oil extraction industry has almost entirely ceased production. Of the 54 dyeing factories, the output of those in operation is less than one-fifth. It is feared that by the Lunar New Year, not only will raw materials be impossible to purchase, but also wages will not be able to be paid. The Changlu salt production urgently needs government loans to cover drying costs; otherwise, not only will the production increase plan fall through, but output may be drastically reduced. The Beijing-Shanghai area has a great need for coal, but the selling price of coal is only 1.08 million per ton, while the selling price in Shanghai reaches 7-8 million, a difference that seems unreasonable.</p>
<p>Rice and Flour Expensive</p>
<p>The selling price of flour in Shanghai is about 600,000 per bag, while in Beiping and Tianjin, it has reached 1.2 million, because each bag must also pay 150,000 for the permission certificate fee, another 150,000 for the exchange fee, plus transportation costs, etc. The high price of rice in Beiping and Tianjin is 16,000 per catty, which is two to three times more expensive than in Shanghai. Generally, due to various restrictions on grain, such as permits, re-exports, and quotas, merchants hesitate to advance. The efficiency of government agencies is slightly lacking, and the amount transported north in name often fails to meet the urgency of the situation. Or the population figures of Tianjin do not fully match the export figures of Shanghai. Before the war, about 2 million bags of flour were transported from Shanghai to Tianjin each month, with miscellaneous grains from Hebei and the Northeast and Northwest excluded. Recently, the population of Beiping and Tianjin is no less than 3.5 million, exceeding the pre-war level, and the source of miscellaneous grains has almost been cut off. Even if 450,000 bags of flour are transported from Shanghai to Tianjin each month, it is still far from meeting the demand.</p>
<p>Farmland Abandoned, Cotton Production Insufficient</p>
<p>At least 200,000 to 300,000 mu of farmland (not entirely in communist areas) that Japan had already reclaimed in North China is lying fallow, and at least one-half of the food in Hebei and Tianjin, based on last year's figures, needs to be transported from the Yangtze River basin for relief. However, Hebei was not included in the first or second year of the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry's five-year grain production increase plan. The current cotton-producing areas in Hebei have only one-half of their original holdings, and last year's cotton production was not even enough to meet one-half of the needs of the textile factories in Hebei and Tianjin. If no foreign cotton is shipped in three months, production cannot be maintained. But this year's cotton loan is still undecided. Last year, Hebei's land tax was collected from 330,000 shi in 47 counties and cities. To date, 13 counties and cities have fallen one after another, and the total amount collected is less than one-half, mostly consumed by security teams and self-defense corps, and cannot be allocated for military rations. As for the purchase price, it is only about one-eighth of the market price, which is even more difficult.</p>
<p>In order to solve the above problems, we sincerely hope that the central government will consider the following measures: Encourage exports, try a linked system, with import quotas accounting for at least 20% of the national total, purchase production equipment, and please allow long-term foreign exchange settlement. Open the Shanghai foreign exchange. Restore production loans and change the hypothecation method. Please quickly negotiate with the United States to purchase wheat and rush it to China. Maintain salt loans and increase salt production. Lift restrictions on the transport of grain from the south to the north and implement the exchange of coal for grain. Increase grain and cotton production and provide generous loans.</p>
<h3>US Consul General Hosts Reporters, First Lesson is Learning Mandarin, Willing to Work to Restore Normal Trade</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper's Report] The newly appointed US Consul General in Shanghai, Cabot, arrived in Shanghai with his wife and daughter. Yesterday morning at 11:30, he held an informal press conference in his office in the Construction Building, making a statement to reporters from various newspapers in the city. At 2:30 in the afternoon, he hosted reporters from foreign newspapers stationed in Shanghai.</p>
<p>During the meeting, Cabot stated that he had decided to learn Chinese and would make learning Chinese one of his initial tasks. When reporters asked about his views on US businesses operating in China, Cabot said that restoring normal trade relations was extremely important after the war. He himself was willing to work towards this restoration. He also stated that the success or failure of trade is related to the normalcy of economic and political conditions and must also depend on the confidence of traders in these conditions.</p>
<p>Cabot further stated that US businessmen operating in China should do their best to comply with the management and restriction measures currently established by the Chinese government, as there is a need for the Chinese government to implement these measures. However, if US businesses find it impossible to proceed according to the regulations, the US government can point out to the Chinese government that these measures are detrimental to the interests of both China and the United States, so that the Chinese government can understand the actual situation.</p>
<p>Regarding the views of the general American public on the current situation in the country, Cabot replied that opinions in the United States varied. However, their basic view is the same, which is that they are unanimously willing to help China alleviate its difficult situation and express respect for China's independence and sovereignty.</p>
<p>After arriving in Shanghai, Cabot has been busy with social engagements and will meet with various leaders of the city. He will visit Mayor Wu in the coming days. This afternoon at 6:00, Mr. and Mrs. Cabot will attend a dinner at 70 Route Say Zoong at the invitation of Mr. and Mrs. Bielski, the acting Consul General.</p>
<h3>Attending Beijing Price Conference, Mayor Wu Returns to Shanghai This Morning</h3>
<p>The National Economic Council convened a price conference in Beijing yesterday morning to review the price situation in various regions. Mayor Wu, summoned to attend, traveled to Beijing on the evening of the 15th with Director of the Social Affairs Bureau Wu Kaixian to report on the recent price situation in Shanghai. It is said that Mayor Wu is returning to Shanghai this morning, as there are municipal affairs awaiting his attention, in order to preside over the preparatory committee meeting for the National Games in the afternoon.</p>
<h3>Additional Tax on Diesel Imports, Executive Yuan Approves Reduction</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper's Report] The municipal government received a reply from the Executive Yuan yesterday, approving the reduction of the additional tax on diesel imports to 15%. The tax on gasoline will remain at 50% and will not be reduced.</p>
<p>Reynolds Comes to China for Exploration [United Press, New York, 15th] Reynolds, the American pen manufacturer, is scheduled to leave Chicago for China on the 16th for an exploration of the Chinese interior. According to Lamb, Reynolds' publicity representative, the purpose of this exploration is to survey the Anyemaqen Mountains, which have not yet been photographed, and especially to discover the height of the mountain range. Lamb argued that the exploration also intends to explore the source of the Yellow River.</p>
<p>Reynolds hopes to depart by plane on the night of the 16th for Minneapolis, and then fly northwest from there to Tokyo and Shanghai. He will disembark in both Tokyo and Shanghai, visiting MacArthur and Mayor Wu. Among the five members of the group, two are pilots: a pilot, Orton, and an engineer, Stevens. A photographer from Life magazine, currently in Shanghai, will also participate.</p>
<h3>Chamber of Commerce on Kowloon Incident, Submits Petition to Chairman for Serious Negotiations</h3>
<p>The National Federation of Chambers of Commerce expressed outrage over the Hong Kong government's dispatch of armed police to force residents in Kowloon City to relocate and forcibly demolish civilian houses. On the 16th, it telegraphed Chairman Chiang of the National Government, President Zhang, and Foreign Minister Wang, requesting serious negotiations and expressing its commitment to fully support the government. The original telegram is recorded below: (Formalities omitted) The Hong Kong government has three times forced residents in Kowloon City to relocate, and recently dispatched armed police to forcibly demolish civilian houses, firing shots and causing trouble, and arresting residents' representatives, sentencing them to hard labor, encroaching on our territory, undermining our sovereignty, insulting our people, and acting recklessly, still in the old imperialist manner. The Kowloon Peninsula Lease Treaty stipulates that the Kowloon City area was not originally included in the lease, and the administration of the city area has always been under the jurisdiction of our government officials. Regardless of the original text of the treaty and historical facts, there should be no misinterpretation. China and Britain have always had cordial relations, and even shared adversity during the war. While trade between the two countries is gradually being promoted, the Hong Kong authorities acted recklessly, leading to this unfortunate incident. What is the meaning of benevolence and friendship? What is the meaning of international justice? In order to safeguard our country's sovereignty and protect the lives and property of our people, we should demand that the Hong Kong government immediately release the arrested residents' representatives, investigate and compensate the losses of the affected residents. Severely punish the perpetrators and ensure that similar incidents do not occur in the future. If necessary, we should request that our government resolutely adopt tough diplomacy, with the great spirit of abolishing unequal treaties, seriously negotiate, and reclaim what is not intact on a specific date, vowing to fully support the government, to the utmost of our urgent prayer. Wang Xiaolai, Chairman of the National Federation of Chambers of Commerce of the Republic of China, all directors and supervisors kowtow, Yin Zixian.</p>
<h3>International Gold and Dollar Case, Criminals Escorted, Family Members Weeping</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper's Report] The international gold and dollar black market case involving criminals Maddox and 16 others was transferred by the police station to the District Prosecutor's Office at 5:30 pm yesterday, along with the seized evidence (the gold and dollar portions were sent separately to the National Bank for safekeeping). This is the largest and most significant gold and dollar case cracked in the city to date in terms of the number of criminals involved. When they were brought out of the police station's detention center, they were all handcuffed, heads bowed, and looking dejected. Before their arrest, they were all well-known figures who manipulated gold and dollars. When they were escorted yesterday, their prestige had vanished, and they were shivering in the cold wind. Their families followed behind, crying and calling out, creating a rather pitiful scene.</p>

<h3>Police Station Requests Extension of Detention for Fourteen Gold and Dollar Case Criminals</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper's Report] The police station yesterday sent a letter to the District Prosecutor's Office, requesting an extension of the detention of the criminals arrested in the gold and dollar black market case cracked by the Financial Management Bureau in conjunction with the Municipal Police Bureau, from the 10th of this month to the 19th, in order to complete the investigation procedures. The list includes a total of 14 people: Liu Jixin, manager of Baoju Tobacco Company; Li Mingyue, tobacco merchant; Feng Bohang, tobacco merchant; E Youhe, tobacco merchant; Shi Guangyou, tobacco merchant; Zhang Yongnian, hardware merchant; Zhuang Shanbing, stockbroker; Yuan Boqing, cotton yarn merchant; Wang Zisheng, antique dealer; and businessmen Shen Zhengyang, Zhou Guirong, and unemployed individuals Wu Youren, Wang Jiasen, and Hua Feng Baoyun.</p>
<h3>Housing Charity Sale Tickets, Worth Promoting for Gift-Giving, Formal Tickets to be Issued Regularly</h3>
<p>The formal tickets for the housing charity sale issued by the Winter Relief Association's Housing Charity Sale Department were all printed yesterday. At 4:00 pm yesterday, the association convened representatives from various banks, shops, newspaper offices, and companies that managed the sales, at the City Bank on the fourth floor, to discuss exchange and issuance methods. The results decided: The current pre-order vouchers for housing charity sale tickets will cease issuance on the 20th of this month. Formal tickets will begin to be issued from the 21st of this month. Holders of pre-order vouchers can exchange them for formal tickets at the original sales outlets from the same day. The pre-order voucher numbers are not the winning numbers; the formal ticket numbers are the winning numbers. From today, various banks, shops, newspaper offices, and companies will simultaneously promote the purchase of "housing charity sale tickets" for gifts during the Spring Festival and for giving New Year's money. The association has also printed exquisite red envelopes with the four auspicious characters "吉祥如意" (Good Fortune as You Wish) and a picture of a house for decoration.</p>
<h3>Winter Relief Association Distributes Winter Clothing to Refugees from Zhabei Fire</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper's Report] The fire in Xinmin Road, Zhabei, the day before yesterday destroyed more than 60 grass sheds, leaving the affected residents with nowhere to eat or sleep, in a very miserable state. The Winter Relief Association specially loaded 2,000 pieces of winter clothing onto trucks yesterday morning and went to the area for distribution, returning only at noon.</p>
<p>In addition, the Four Banks, Two Bureaus, and all colleagues in the silver and money industry in the city have launched a fundraising campaign in response to the relief movement, and have already collected donations of approximately 30 million yuan.</p>
<p>Another New Profession for Women, Passenger Service Personnel Graduate [This Newspaper's Report] Following the "air hostess," China Airlines has recently trained more than a dozen "female passenger service personnel," and a graduation ceremony is scheduled to be held at the Sandza Building at 9:30 this morning.</p>
<h3>Severe Coal Shortage, Expected to Be Resolved in Short Term, Consumption by Public Utilities Not to Be Reduced Temporarily</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper's Report] This year's coal shortage has entered its most severe stage. It is understood that the city's current coal reserves are only sufficient for 35 days, lasting until about February 20th. The Fuel Management Committee convened a meeting on this matter and decided to request that various public utilities under the jurisdiction of the Public Utilities Bureau immediately reduce coal consumption by half, in an attempt to remedy the situation. The Public Utilities Bureau uses coal as its largest driving force. If the amount of coal is reduced by half, work must also be suspended by half, which would greatly affect the citizens' basic needs of food, clothing, housing, and transportation. After discussion at the municipal government's municipal affairs meeting, it was decided to reluctantly maintain the status quo and temporarily not reduce the amount of coal. However, each company will be responsible for conserving as much as possible and using it carefully in order to overcome the current difficulties together.</p>
<p>However, according to Director Zhao's statement yesterday: the severe coal shortage is expected to be resolved in the short term. The city currently has more than 70,000 tons of coal in reserve. Approximately 40,000 tons of coal are being shipped from Taiwan to Shanghai, and another 40,000 tons are being shipped from Central China to Shanghai. Moreover, the average coal reserves of various public utility companies in the city are sufficient for 20 days of use. The central government has now ordered the Central Bank to allocate foreign exchange for the Central Trust Bureau to purchase 100,000 tons of American coal, which is expected to arrive around February 20th. Furthermore, Director Shi of the Beining Railway telegraphed, informing that the railway from Kailuan to Xingang has been opened, and the first train has already departed, so the coal reserves there can be continuously transported to supply Shanghai.</p>
<h3>Jiang Shangda's Original Sentence Upheld</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper's Report] Jiang Shangda, a member of the puppet Cotton Industry Control Committee and a director of the puppet Chamber of Commerce, was accused of being a suspected traitor. He was previously sentenced by the High Court to imprisonment for one year and three months. After the Supreme Court remanded the case for reconsideration, the sentence was upheld yesterday.</p>
<h3>Five Criminals in Airplane Drug Trafficking Case Sentenced to Imprisonment, Two Merchants Declared Not Guilty</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper's Report] The case of using China Airlines' Shanghai-bound civilian flights to traffic large quantities of opium and morphine was prosecuted by the District Prosecutor's Office and has been concluded by the court after trial. Yesterday, Judge Shen Tianbao sentenced Nie Chengshan, a merchant, and Yin Liangchen, a medicinal herb merchant, to 12 years of imprisonment for jointly trafficking drugs. Shi Ting and Sun Shougao, mechanics at China Airlines, were sentenced to 10 years of imprisonment for helping to traffic drugs. Wei Wenxiang, a mechanic, was sentenced to 7 years of imprisonment for helping to traffic drugs. Zhuang Zhongfu, a tailor, and Yuan Huiming, a worker at the medicinal herb business, were declared not guilty due to insufficient evidence.</p>

<p>In order to alleviate the grain shortage in North China, encourage exports, and revive construction,</p>
<p>The Tianjin Importers and Exporters Association has provided the authorities with four main recommendations, which the North China petition delegation carried to Beijing on the evening of the 16th. The contents of the recommendations are as follows: Use foreign exchange from exports to exchange for foreign wheat flour. Method: According to the association's estimates of export goods, the total export amount may increase to US$10 million within March, April and May of this year due to the encouragement of the grain exchange method. Calculated according to the price of American and Canadian flour, it can import one million bags of flour, which is sufficient for the needs of the North for three months. As for the export and import procedures, it is proposed that the Tianjin office of the Transportation and Supervision Committee be responsible for handling them, with the participation of the Central Bank, the Tianjin Municipal Government, and the association's responsible person. Sincerely encourage the export business to earn foreign exchange. Method: 1. Regarding loans: A. The original method of export of raw goods should be quickly restored. B. The original loan period for packaging was three months, but recently it was changed to one month. Export procedures often cannot be completed in one month, so please restore the minimum three-month period. C. The procedures for borrowers are complicated, please simplify the procedures to avoid unnecessary difficulties. 2. Regarding control: A. Export goods can be exchanged for foreign exchange and are different from general materials that may flow into communist areas. Please do not obstruct export goods that have been certified by designated banks by local material control agencies. B. The inspection standards issued by the Ministry of Economic Affairs for the inspection of export goods often do not match the actual situation and are not required by foreign markets. Please instruct the relevant authorities to provide effective assistance and flexibility to exporters. 3. Regarding local barriers: The export of local products from the North is restricted by local government orders, and goods that can be transported smoothly, such as soybeans, oils, and hides, are subject to layers of control, causing many obstacles. Please order the governments in each producing area to lift these barriers. Import quotas are too small and far from meeting the needs of North China's industrial construction. Please relax them as much as possible so that the North's recovery work can proceed smoothly. Method: Please increase the reasonable share of the national import foreign exchange quota according to the Northern import situation before the war and the current needs of industry and mining. The Tianjin Transportation Control Committee, the Industrial Association, and the Association will be responsible for the investigation and request approval. The linked system is a relatively good method to save foreign exchange depletion and adjust international trade. Please adopt and implement it. Method: Import goods are still restricted according to government regulations to prevent the import of unnecessary items. The percentage of export foreign exchange that should be returned to the national treasury and technical issues should be handled by the Transportation Control Committee, the Central Bank, and the Association in consideration of the situation in the North.</p>
<h3>Legislative Election, Reaching White-Hot Stage</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper's Report] The legislative election in this city has reached a white-hot stage. At 9:00 am yesterday, the Civil Affairs Bureau convened more than 200 staff members and Baozhangs from the six districts of Hongkou, North Station, Tilanqiao, Jianlin, Yangshupu, and Xinshijie, and held a meeting at the Yong'an Grand Theater on Yokohama Bridge. Candidates such as Fang Zhichao were present. Director Zhang chaired the meeting, reported, and introduced each candidate separately. Subsequently, each candidate delivered a speech successively. Also, at 8:00 pm last night, Fang Zhichao again broadcast his election platform on the Junsheng Radio Station.</p>
<p>Tongji University students Shi Yun, Chen Zhenxi, Fang Shanshu, Xu Xuewu, Xu Rongfan, Pan Zuyong, etc., in support of former professor Fang Zhichao's legislative election, held a pre-celebration dinner party at the Yijing Club on Shaoxing Road last night. More than 200 people were present. Pan Zuyong chaired the meeting and delivered a speech, expressing support and pre-celebration. Professor Fang was also invited to express his election opinions.</p>
<p>Zhou Yizhi is running for legislative election in this city area. Yesterday, Vice Chairman Sun specially wrote a recommendation for him. The original text reads: "Exercising constitutionalism is a major event in China today, and it is related to the fate of China in the future, as everyone knows. The election of National Assembly representatives has been completed, and now the legislative election is underway. According to the Constitution, the duties of the Legislative Yuan will be very important in the future, so the selection of legislative candidates has become a problem that the whole country attaches great importance to. Shanghai is China's largest city, an area of international importance, where most of China's industrial and commercial strength is concentrated, and it is also the base for China's cultural development, so the election of Shanghai's legislative members should be even more solemn. Former legislator Comrade Zhou Yizhi has been in office for fifteen years and should have experience in legislative work. He has always advocated democracy and insisted on justice, which I think is also well known to all walks of life. He is currently practicing law in Shanghai, has been nominated by a political party, and is participating in the election.

<p>Two Year-End Bonus Disputes Resolved [This Newspaper's Report] The year-end bonus dispute in the machine-made sewing industry has been resolved after mediation by the Social Affairs Bureau's Year-End Bonus Handling Committee. Labor and management have agreed that the standard for monthly workers' year-end bonus is one month's salary, and the standard for piece workers is fifteen days' work. Employers who are unable to afford the bonus due to business losses may negotiate on their own. Special shops can handle it on their own.</p>
<p>An agreement has been reached on the year-end bonus for the white weaving group of the dyeing and weaving industry. Last year, the bonus was issued in three grades, A, B, and C, each with two levels. Grade A was 50 yuan, 40 yuan, and 27 yuan. Grades B and C each decreased by 2 yuan per level. This year's year-end bonus is calculated at 80% of last year's bonus. Of this, 40% is issued according to last December's index, and 60% is issued according to the assumed index for January (last December's index plus 30%). It will be paid in full by the 26th of this month. The year-end bonus for the patterned fabric group and the dyeing and finishing group is still under negotiation and can also be resolved soon.</p>
<h3>林區時裝店 為爭年獎怠工</h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] Fashion industry workers in the Lin Sen district shops went on strike yesterday due to disputes over year-end bonuses. A small portion of the Jing'an Temple area also experienced similar situations. According to workers, the union petitioned the industry association to issue year-end bonuses on November 17th of last year, but the employers did not respond. The union then petitioned the Social Affairs Bureau for mediation, but the employers consistently failed to send representatives. The Social Affairs Bureau stated that if there was a past practice of providing year-end bonuses, they should still be issued. As the end of the year approaches and workers urgently need to return to their hometowns, they are demanding prompt payment. Yesterday, worker representatives went to the Social Affairs Bureau to request instructions from the Year-End Bonus Handling Committee, which decided to transfer the case to the Labor-Management Arbitration Committee for processing and advised the workers to resume work immediately.</p>

<h3>承印共黨小冊 蘇僑被提公訴</h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] Soviet citizen Vasily Aiyev, currently working as a doorman at the Klimen Company, was originally a printer.

After investigation by Prosecutor Zhang Yuanzhen, it was determined that the Communist Party is an illegal organization in our country, having been explicitly announced as such by the National Government. Mao Zedong is the leader of that party, and he uses words to incite others. The defendant printed these materials, thereby committing the "crime of disrupting order" under Article 153, Paragraph 1 of the Criminal Law. A public prosecution has been initiated, and the case has been transferred to the Criminal Court of the District Court and will be publicly tried soon.</p>

<h3>查禁茶舞 分區執行 新舞女停止登記 傳習所再度訴願</h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] After the ban on dancing and related measures arrived in the city a few days ago, the Business Section of the Police Bureau was ordered to implement them yesterday. Each sub-bureau has divided all officers into several small groups according to the location of dance halls, bars, and cafes, and dispatched them to patrol and check whether tea dances are still being held. The Police Bureau also dispatched a large number of juvenile police officers to various dance venues yesterday afternoon for inspection. The Dance Hall Industry Association has notified its 29 member dance halls to comply with the order to stop tea dances. In addition to allowing already registered dancers to transfer their registrations, the Police Bureau has stopped registering new dancers as of yesterday. However, according to statistics, the total number of registered dancers in November of last year was 2,022. Since the announcement of the ban on dancing, the total number of registered dancers has decreased to 1,645 as of yesterday. Therefore, it is expected that the number of dancers will gradually decrease after the tea dances are banned. The Social Affairs Bureau is currently planning for the aftermath of providing relief to the dancers.</p>
<p>In addition, there are 314 licensed cafe dancers and barmaids in the city, as well as 29 dance training schools, which are also within the scope of the ban. Representatives of the training schools held an emergency meeting last night and decided to send Bao Longyun, Li Yasheng, Zhou Yuehan, and Qian Zonglian to Nanjing by night train to appeal to the Executive Yuan again. Their reasons are: Dance schools do not train dancers, but are purely for the study of dance art. The names and qualifications of the students admitted to the dance schools can be provided to the authorities for review. The British Academy of Dance Art receives government subsidies every month. The authorities should regard dance schools as legitimate academic groups, and manage and supervise them instead of forcing them to close down. Dance school teachers have difficult lives, and the tuition fees collected are difficult to refund in a short time. Therefore, they hope that the deadline for closing down can be extended for a reasonable period. It is heard that they will spare no effort to the very end and will once again state to the authorities the pain of closing down if ordered to do so. At the same time, they have requested the Municipal Government to suspend execution until the Executive Yuan has responded to their appeal.</p>
<h3>新任輸管會主任委員 霍寶樹就職視事 輸出輸入力求平衡發展</h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] The newly appointed Chairman of the Import and Export Control Commission, Huo Baoshu, officially took office at 10:00 AM yesterday at the auditorium on the fourth floor of the Bank of China. Huo addressed all the staff of the Control Commission, pointing out that the past management of import and export policies had been too drastic and was not appropriate. He also said that the Control Commission is a complex business organization, and that the promotion of work in the future should be as simple as possible, avoiding complexity, and put forward three principles: International trade should be fair, the quota allocation between industries should be fair, and the attitude of handling matters should be fair. The efficiency of the Control Commission will be improved to make it a sound organization. Huo particularly emphasized two points: First, the various regulations of the Control Commission will not be easily changed unless absolutely necessary, so as to avoid the suffering of merchants who do not know what to do. Second, the rights and obligations of importers should be balanced. In other words, importers should not be satisfied with obtaining quota allocations, but should further assist the government in promoting exports and earning foreign exchange.</p>
<p>After Huo took office, he met with reporters and gave brief answers to the various questions raised: Smuggling in South China is still rampant, but it is expected that the situation will improve in the short term because the Chinese government has now strengthened anti-smuggling measures and can obtain the cooperation of the Hong Kong government. In the future, import and export should be balanced and developed, and should be coordinated with relevant departments to adapt to current needs. The amount of import quotas should be reasonable, and the export of agricultural products in our country should be encouraged as much as possible. At present, all countries lack US dollars, so the method of barter is worth considering.</p>
<h3>利用中紡餘力 解決南市電荒 併車試驗成功下月正式供電</h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] The Public Works Bureau, considering that the Lunar New Year is approaching and that electricity is urgently needed for merchants and residents in the South City, is considering using the self-provided generators of China Textile Company's First, Sixth, Seventeenth, and Nineteenth Factories to supplement the power supply. The total capacity of the four generators is 60,000 kilowatts, and the actual power generation is 4,500 kilowatts.

<h3>私售行總卡車 藍春池被偵查</h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] Lan Chunchi, former Specialist Commissioner of the Executive Yuan Relief and Rehabilitation Administration, is being investigated by the District Prosecutor's Office for allegedly abusing his position to sell trucks privately. While serving concurrently as Chairman of the Truck Distribution Review Committee of the Administration, Lan falsely used the name of the "Fupu Xian Automobile Transportation Company" of Fujian to purchase two three-ton Ford trucks.

The defendant Lan Chunchi has repeatedly failed to appear when summoned, and the District Prosecutor's Office is continuing to search for evidence.</p>
<h3>行方便竟生意外 留一宿妻被姦汚</h3>

Unexpectedly, Gao Xiande saw Longchao's wife lying naked on the bed and was aroused by lust. He shone a flashlight on her and pulled out a fake pistol, preventing Gao Longchao from resisting, and raped his wife.

<h3>張桂年的發明之夢 未完成的濬河激水機 離開實際研究試騐的科學道路 走上途徑竟妄想鉅額獎金 跟吳鼎昌薛篤弼打官司</h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper, Nanjing, 15th] "Inventor" Zhang Guinian cherished a dream of inventing a river dredging and water-pumping machine, and hoped to obtain a huge reward from the government in this dream. However, when this dream was shattered, he did not intend to investigate the reasons for his failure, but instead took legal action to sue the current Secretary-General of the National Government, Wu Dingchang, and the current Minister of Water Resources, Xue Dubi. His reason was that his invention was reported to the Ministry of Water Resources but was not approved for a long time. There was no suspicion of anyone copying it, and the government's reward for his invention should not be only 500,000 yuan. Therefore, he believed that Wu and Xue were both obliterating his hard work in invention and seemed to be deducting his bonus.</p>
<p>Zhang Guinian actually filed a lawsuit, and the defendants are high-ranking officials in important positions today. This is the same ability as his self-confidence in inventing a river dredging and water-pumping machine without testing it and being confident of success. At the same time, he also regularly does one thing, which is to constantly send letters to Chairman Chiang. It is said that in the past there was a period when he would write a letter every ten days. It is truly painstaking and persistent, and one cannot help but admire him! Now, this</p>
<p>lawsuit will be heard in the Shanghai District Court on the 27th of this month. The reporter once visited Minister Xue Dubi and asked him if he would appear in court. He smiled and said, "I will not pay attention to him. Many facts do not need me to explain, and we only regard him as a patient with mental illness." Xue's words are not without reason. Now let us take a look at the process of his invention.</p>
<p>Zhang Guinian is from Tianjin, 45 years old this year. He entered a private school as a child, and dropped out of school at the age of 15 due to poverty. He lived by the Haihe River in Tianjin. In 1917, North China was devastated by floods, and the Haihe River was cut straight, and the Sancha River mouth was abandoned. The river channel was straightened, but the silt accumulation could not be reduced. For the inventor Zhang Guinian, in his</p>
<p>residence by the Haihe River, listening to the angry sound of the water, began his motivation for invention. Of course, this motivation was to save people and the world. Finally, in the form of the water flow, he realized that there was a necessity for a new invention, so he decided to invent a river dredging and water-pumping machine to make the water flow in a circular shape, so that the water flow would not stop and there would be no more silt accumulation.</p>
<p>What is this thing? It is a simple machine with rotating four blades to be installed on</p>
<p>a flat-bottomed boat. It is made of iron plate, three zhang in diameter, and the blades are six or seven chi thick. It completely uses water flow force, has no power itself, but can convert the water flow force into impact force that can impact 50 li.</p>
<p>After he submitted the description of this invention to the Ministry of Water Resources, the Ministry of Water Resources sent technician Peng Dusheng to contact him. It is said that Peng went six times, talking with him each time for two or three hours. Zhang's expression to Peng was that he would not accept criticism before testing, and subjectively believed that it would be successful. Therefore, the Ministry of Water Resources, after studying and researching after not obtaining his blueprints and</p>
<p>test instructions and other practical examples to prove it, believed that there were many forces to be tested, so it decided to give him a subsidy of 500,000 yuan to reward Zhang for his hard work in inventing the river dredging and water-pumping machine.</p>
<p>That is the fact, but Zhang, based on his dream of both fame and wealth, was unwilling to settle for a subsidy of only 500,000 yuan, and finally angrily took the</p>
<p>legal solution.</p>
<p>Now, what I want to report to the reader is Zhang Guinian's character. After Zhang was fifteen years old, he worked and learned business. In 1929 and 1930, he repeatedly wrote to Chairman Chiang and General Commander Yan, talking freely about current affairs. Later, he wrote to the then Mayor of Tianjin and the provincial committees, but all were unsuccessful. In the winter of 1931, he wrote to Executive Duan again. This time he unexpectedly received a summons, but did not get any work. Finally, he wrote to the Tianjin Municipal Social Affairs Bureau and was able to work as a clerk in the Social Affairs Bureau for several years. After the Anti-Japanese War, in 1942, he left Tianjin and went to Shanghai, working in the Yarn Exchange. In December of last year, he began to write to Chairman Chiang and the Executive Yuan again, presenting the process of his invention of the river dredging and water-pumping machine, up to now.</p>
<p>One of the most important conditions for an inventor to possess is to accept criticism, but Zhang Guinian does not accept criticism. At the same time, there must be test instructions in the invention process, but he has never tested it and has no way to explain it. This is a kind of stubbornness that transcends reality. What will be the outcome of the lawsuit? After a trial in court on the 27th, everything will be clear. (Reported by Zhang Ming, reporter of this newspaper)</p>
<h3>蘇省督運軍糧 大部均已完成</h3>

<h3>避讓當路野狗 人車翻身墮河 蘇州鉅商季小松 子受重傷侄兒死</h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper, Suzhou, 15th] A tragic traffic accident occurred in Suzhou on the afternoon of the 14th, with one death and one injury. Ji Xiaosong, a wealthy timber merchant who is a well-known figure in the local business community and former president of the Chamber of Commerce, was recently recuperating at home. At about 3:00 PM on the 14th, his son Shanchu went out to handle business with his cousin Kunyi. They rode their own machine bicycles, and when they passed the Pinghua Bridge on Lindun Road, they accidentally crashed into the river while avoiding a stray dog in the road due to the front wheel being unstable. After the accident, nearby patrol police bravely jumped into the river to rescue them one by one. Unfortunately, Ji Kunyi had a hole in his left temple, with blood gushing out. Ji Shanchu was injured in the face and was not seriously injured, but his mind was still blurred due to severe internal shock. The deceased, Ji Kunyi, had an elderly mother and a beloved wife. After hearing the news, they rushed to the scene and wept loudly over the body, fainting one after another, which was unbearable to witness.</p>
<h3>鄱湖水位低落</h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper, Poyang, 15th] Poyang Lake is the only reservoir in Jiangxi Province, and the rise and fall of its water level is related to shipping and transportation. Last year, the water source of Poyang Lake was not large. There was a severe drought for two months after autumn, coupled with a sudden drop in river water, and the lake water drained outward. The siltation around Longkou and Zhumushan was the most severe, making it difficult for civilian ships to navigate. In the counties along the lake, large quantities of local products were piled up and could not be transported smoothly. Porcelain from Jingdezhen and coal from Leping were mostly exported through the Jinqi Highway and dry road transport.</p>
<h3>Price Stabilization: Changzhou Relieves 20,000 Poor People</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Wujin Fifteenth Dispatch] In order to maintain the livelihood of the poor in view of rising prices, the local authorities of this county specially invited representatives from various institutions to the county government and decided on a price stabilization plan. The beneficiaries of the price stabilization are based on the list of poor people from the Winter Relief Association, estimated to be more than 20,000 people, with a total rice volume of 3,000 shi. The price difference will be borne by the Chamber of Commerce with 300 million [currency unit], which must be paid off by the end of this month. The shortfall will be borne by the Grain Storage Committee. The source of grain for price stabilization will be supplied by the Grain Storage Association, purchased and sold as needed, and handled by the Grain Association. Price stabilization will be carried out in four phases, one phase every five days, with four sheng for large households and three sheng for small households per phase, handled in five locations: east, south, west, north, and center. The first phase will run from the tenth day of the twelfth lunar month to the twenty-fifth day. All procedures are being rushed through.</p>
<h3>Suzhou Legislative Yuan Election: Reaching the Stage of Close Quarters Combat</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Suzhou Fifteenth Dispatch] The election campaign for the Legislative Yuan in Suzhou is becoming increasingly heated. The propaganda war of various candidates has already begun. Yan Xinqi, nominated by the Kuomintang, and Song Jicheng, nominated by the Min She Dang (Social Democratic Party), are competing most fiercely. Campaign slogans are colorful and plentiful in the streets. At night, wine shops and teahouses are brightly lit, and behind-the-scenes lobbying has reached the stage of close quarters combat. Mr. Yan is the current Speaker of the Senate and is usually enthusiastic about local public welfare, promoting it with all his might. He has great credibility among township Baojia (local security system) and also has the enthusiastic support of more than a hundred senators scattered throughout the townships, and is about to sweep the Suzhou votes. Mr. Song is a lawyer and a senior figure in the legal profession, with considerable potential in the old society. This time he is participating in the election, nominated by the gentry class, and he will also compete with all his might. Other candidates from outside Suzhou include Di Ying from Taicang, Wu Shaoshu from Songjiang, and Zhong Zhaoxiang from Wujiang, and many others. They are fighting each other fiercely, and the atmosphere of democracy is quite strong.</p>
<h3>Ripples of Paradise: Xinjiang Song and Dance Troupe in Hangzhou</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Hangzhou Fifteenth Electric Dispatch] On January 10th, the Xinjiang Song and Dance Troupe was brought to Hangzhou by the West Lake No. 1 cruise ship and car. It was a cloudy afternoon, and the Hangzhou city station was packed with people. Although the railway police tried their best, they could not maintain order. When the car arrived, it was even more crowded. With great difficulty, a path was squeezed out to allow them to board the two most beautiful tour buses in Hangzhou, heading straight for the Xinxin Hotel in the inner West Lake.</p>
<p>Seven or Eight Days of Hospitality In the afternoon, they attended a welcome meeting from all walks of life and performed several programs. The next day, they braved the rain to visit Beishan. The third day they played on the lake and visited the Youth Association. The fourth day they climbed to the top of Yuhuang Mountain, went to the Liuhe Pagoda, the Qiantang River Bridge, and then to Zhijiang University, the "most excellent school environment" in the world. The fifth day they visited silk weaving factories, silk weaving scenery factories, and youth halls that they did not have there. The sixth day they visited the National Art College and National Zhejiang University, and the seventh day they visited the Air Force Officer School.</p>
<p>The Xinjiang Song and Dance Troupe spent almost every day of their seven or eight days in Hangzhou with a tight schedule. There were three or four banquets from agencies and organizations every day, and one or two tea parties every day. People crowded everywhere to see them. Several performance nights broke the iron doors of the theaters and collapsed the emergency exits. People were packed inside to enjoy their dance skills. Forty Xinjiang children indeed infused the calm surface of West Lake with a primitive emotional excitement, causing ripples.</p>
<p>The Emergence of the Song and Dance Troupe The reporter spent seven or eight days with them, so I know them relatively clearly. They were organized by the Propaganda Committee of the Xinjiang Provincial Government. Originally, song and dance were extremely common in Xinjiang. Children who can run and jump at the age of five or six, and old people in their seventies and eighties, can all dance and sing. The emergence of this song and dance troupe was due to the selection of people who are relatively good at singing and dancing from various regions to participate. After a month of training in Dihua, they set off for Nanjing. Among this group of people, the most educated are graduates of normal schools, followed by middle schools, and then primary schools. In Xinjiang, there is a Xinjiang Academy, as well as provincial normal schools, provincial middle schools, and provincial girls' middle schools.</p>
<p>Reporters Participate Inside In the era of Sheng Shicai's rule in Xinjiang, schools had to study Russian. Now schools no longer read Russian, only Uyghur and Chinese. Uyghur is relatively similar to Turkish. There are three newspapers in the area: Xinjiang Daily, Freedom Daily, and Uyghur-Chinese Daily. Each of these newspapers sells only a few thousand copies. It is said that each newspaper originally sold more than 10,000 copies, but later the number of sales gradually declined due to traffic obstructions. There is also a publication called Altai Monthly, which also sells only a little over 1,000 copies. In this song and dance troupe, two are newspaper reporters, one is Mr. Haiber, the editor-in-chief of Altai Monthly, and the other is Ms. Palida, a reporter for Xinjiang Daily and Freedom Daily. However, they are not accompanying reporters, but members of the troupe, song and dance performers.</p>
<p>Don't Treat Xinjiang as an Outsider They hope we don't treat Xinjiang as an outsider. In the era of Sheng Shicai, it is said that Han people bullied Uyghurs. After Zhang Zhizhong's rule in Xinjiang, Han and Uyghur people are truly one family. They do not like ideologies without ethnicity or country. They love ethnicity and country. Due to their beliefs and the development of their good knowledge and abilities, it is believed that the Yili problem will be resolved.</p>
<p>A Glimpse of Xinjiang Customs There are no bananas, pears, or some fruits produced in the southeast on the streets of Xinjiang. There are particularly many melons there, which are sweet and fragrant. Most people wear wool, and silk is a precious fabric. When there are important guests, they use pilaf to entertain the guests, which is to cook fruits and rice together and grab it with their hands, unlike here where dishes are served one after another endlessly. Funerals involve wrapping the body in white cloth and burying it in the ground, without coffins.</p>
<p>This time, they came to the inland and received such a warm welcome from the people of the inland. They will return with incomparable joy to convey our good intentions. They are even more eager for our inland culture to have an exchange role with the frontier culture. They want us to see Xinjiang as closely related as lips and teeth, and to help them as much as possible.</p>
<p>Frontier Cultural Research Now, we have finally seen their culture: the rough and cheerful music, the simple and lively dance. Especially the flute, which leads the musical instruments, and the swaying neck in the dance, these are all our own culture, treasures inherited from our ancestors. How can we forget it? How can we not study and improve it, and seek something else from foreign pianos, foreign drums, thighs, and decadent sounds? Are we really old? No, the frontier culture is still very young. As long as we study and improve it, we will have a thriving and vigorous day.</p>
<p>During their seven or eight days in Hangzhou, they were warmly loved by the people of "Paradise," and they were also intoxicated by the environment of "Paradise." It is hoped that after they leave, they will bring back our enthusiasm and cultural relics, and leave behind their enthusiasm and performance spirit, so that we can brace ourselves and study and improve well to enrich our own national culture.

<h3>"Female Police Officer, Arrest, Permed Hair": Hangzhou Hairdressers Are Furious</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Hangzhou Fifteenth Dispatch] Hairdressers in this city have suddenly become furious after the "Fake Phoenix and False Phoenix Case." Recently, Zhejiang Provincial Radio Station inserted a humorous program "Female Police Officer Arrests Permed Hair," which was intended to encourage women to practice thrift. Hairdressers, after listening to it, all believed that it had a significant impact on their business. Therefore, they were all indignant and sent representatives to the Recreation Workers' Union to lodge a serious protest. After the union publicly apologized, the storm subsided. Hangzhou is experiencing a severe shortage of housing, and landlords are calculating rents based on goods and cost of living indexes. Poor civil servants cannot afford it and many are staying in office small hotels. Staff from various departments of the provincial government have initiated the formation of a tenant association to resist various illegal measures by landlords. More than 600 people have signed up, and a general meeting is scheduled to be held at the People's Education Center on the 18th. (Special correspondent Shao Yue)</p>

<p>C. Increasing the Tonnage of Privately Operated Shipping Vessels</p>
<p>Opening up shipping and encouraging private operation has always been the main policy of maritime administration. After the victory of the War of Resistance against Japan, most of the private shipping companies destroyed by the enemy and puppets were assisted by the government. The following steps are formulated to encourage private operation:</p>
<p>Compensating for Losses of Requisitioned Vessels: In addition to the US$3.6 million approved by the Executive Yuan for compensation, a portion of the US ship purchase loan will be allocated to allow shipping companies to purchase vessels in the United States.</p>

<p>Rewarding the Import of Shipbuilding Materials: The method of which will be formulated separately.</p>
<p>Original Plan (5)</p>
<p>Telegraphs are operated by the central government, and wireless stations for special needs in the sea and air, such as aviation and shipping, should be allowed to be set up independently under the management of the central government.</p>
<p>Implementation measures:</p>
<p>A. Active Establishment of Aviation and Maritime Wireless Stations</p>
<p>The independent establishment of aviation and maritime wireless stations should be supervised by the Ministry of Transportation in accordance with the "Aviation Wireless Station Establishment Rules" and the "Ship Wireless Station Regulations" to urge aircraft and ships to independently set up radio stations. In addition to aviation and maritime, various agencies have a large number of dedicated radio stations with chaotic wavelengths and many abuses, which should be gradually eliminated to comply with regulations. The Ministry of Transportation should strengthen the control of radio waves.</p>
<p>B. Strengthening the Implementation of Central Government Operated Telecommunications</p>
<p>To strengthen the implementation of central government-operated telecommunications, we should follow the telecommunications five-year construction plan formulated by the Ministry of Transportation in the 36th year [of the Republic of China, i.e. 1947]. The first two years will focus on restoring the pre-war status quo, and the last three years will gradually increase equipment to have a minimum preliminary communication network. Special attention should be paid to the acquisition of equipment and materials to achieve the purpose of strengthening state-owned telecommunications.</p>
<p>Original Plan (6)</p>
<p>Long-distance telephone trunk lines and inter-provincial rail lines are laid by the central government within each province, and branch lines are laid by the province, but they must not be parallel to trunk lines or inter-provincial lines (the division of trunk and branch lines is stipulated by the central government), and county and township branch lines are laid by the provincial government.</p>
<p>Implementation measures:</p>
<p>In accordance with this plan, the Ministry of Transportation stipulates that the lines along the coast, railways, national highways, provincial highways, and rivers where ships navigate shall be used as trunk lines, and the rest shall be used as branch lines. The Ministry of Transportation shall immediately plan and draw a trunk line distribution map and publish it. The laying method for provincial branch lines and city, county, and township lines will be formulated separately.</p>
<p>Original Plan (7)</p>
<p>For urban telephones, except for municipalities directly under the central government, which are operated by the central government or publicly, the remaining counties are encouraged to operate by the people, and methods are stipulated to allow them to connect with long-distance telephones. Implementation measures:</p>
<p>A. Operation of Urban Telephones</p>
<p>Regarding privately operated urban telephones, the Ministry of Transportation should support the normal development of private operation in accordance with the principles of the "Regulations on the Establishment and Elimination of Privately Operated Urban Telephones," and appropriately revise these regulations and handle them according to the actual situation.</p>
<p>B. Stipulating Methods for Connecting with Long-Distance Telephones</p>
<p>The connection between urban telephones and long-distance telephones is also stipulated in the above regulations, and a contract format for the connection of state-owned long-distance calls and privately operated city calls has been formulated, which will be signed by the telecommunications bureau and private companies at any time, and still be handled by the competent department in accordance with the announced rules.</p>
<p>Original Plan (8)</p>
<p>The government should do its best to supervise and assist the construction of various transportation projects and the manufacturing of transportation vehicles.</p>
<p>Implementation measures:</p>
<p>A. Supervision and Assistance in the Construction of Various Transportation Projects</p>
<p>Regarding the supervision and assistance in the construction of various transportation projects, in addition to strengthening the implementation of various state-owned enterprises, the supervision and assistance of public and private enterprises shall be gradually handled in accordance with the above implementation measures.</p>
<p>B. Supervision and Assistance in the Manufacturing of Transportation Vehicles</p>
<p>We should do our best to encourage people to manufacture various transportation vehicles, provide various manufacturing and inspection standards, and provide technical assistance. The qualified products should be purchased as much as possible by various state-owned transportation agencies. The government should improve the industrial environment, protect industrial profits, and at the same time ensure that funds have sources and loans are convenient. In the initial stage of implementation, we should relax the import quota of raw materials and supply foreign exchange. Other measures such as stabilizing prices and wages should also be actively promoted to seek the development of private enterprises.</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper Sixteenth Dispatch] Regarding the incident of Chen Junming, a student of Jiaxing Youth Middle School under the Youth Cadre Training Class of the Ministry of National Defense, being shot and killed at Jiaxing Station, the Railway Police Department yesterday issued a special announcement on the situation. According to reports: "At 11:40 a.m. on the 10th of this month, the 61st train arrived in He [Jiaxing]. Chen Hourong, the captain of the Qing Middle School team, did not obey the order and exited the station from the entrance. The road police interfered and were insulted and beaten. Because the road police resisted, Chen's nose was accidentally injured. After Chen returned to school, a Qing Middle School official came to the police substation to negotiate, making many conditions and changing them repeatedly until the next day. At 7:50 p.m. on the 11th, more than 100 Qing Middle School students poured into the Mingxing Grand Theater, searching for road police but failing to find them. However, a traffic police technician was mistakenly beaten because his uniform was similar to that of the road police. When they realized they had made a mistake, they became even more angry. That night at 8:50 p.m., they gathered three to four hundred people and surrounded the station in three routes. Zhu Shenggao and two other police officers on duty were tied up, and Inspector Deng Gongrui and three other police officers were beaten and injured. The police substation office was also destroyed.

<h3>Public and Private Colleges and Universities in Shanghai Protest the Kowloon Walled City Incident, Issue Joint Declaration, and Propose Five Demands</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper News] More than 30 presidents of public and private colleges and universities in Shanghai, including Zhang Yi, Zhu Jingnong, Ou Yuan, and Ling Xian, attended the Shanghai Scholarship Unified Review Committee the other day to discuss the issue of the British Hong Kong government forcibly demolishing the residences of Chinese residents in Kowloon Walled City. It was decided to entrust Zhu Jingnong and six others to draft a joint declaration in the name of the "Shanghai College and University Association." The full text of the declaration is recorded as follows: Recently, the British Hong Kong government forcibly demolished the houses of our Chinese residents in Kowloon Walled City, shot and injured many innocent residents, causing bloody incidents, and illegally arrested resident representatives and sentenced them to penal servitude. This kind of behavior that despises our national sovereignty and goes against humanity makes us unable to refrain from making a serious statement.</p>
<p>The "Convention Between Great Britain and China Respecting an Extension of Hong Kong Territory," signed on June 9, 1898, stipulated: "All Chinese officials now stationed in Kowloon City shall continue to exercise jurisdiction there, and it is further agreed that the district of Kowloon City and its vicinity shall be reserved as a place of resort for the convenience of Chinese men-of-war, merchant vessels and junks, and for the free passage of the inhabitants of the city and its neighbourhood." It can be seen that the Chinese government still retains sovereignty over Kowloon Walled City and its nearby docks and sea areas. Now the Hong Kong government is illegally forcing the demolition of the houses of Chinese residents in the territory under our country's jurisdiction, which is an aggressive act that destroys our national sovereignty.</p>
<p>Recently, the British government has gradually adopted a moderate policy towards the rule of colonies, such as allowing the independence of India and Myanmar. This is indeed a gratifying thing in the eyes of the Chinese people. Unexpectedly, the Hong Kong government is still executing the aggressive policies of the past imperialist rights, which is infinitely regrettable and indignant. China and Britain were allies during the war. Our army fought side by side with the British army on the battlefields of India and Myanmar, and the friendship was excellent. Now that the war has ended not long ago, the British government is treating its previous loyal allies in this way, which is contrary to the way of making friends. Leaving aside the above points, we have always known that Britain has always respected personal freedom, property, and life. Now, it has forcibly demolished the houses of Chinese residents, causing countless people to be displaced, and opened fire on the unarmed old, weak, women, and children, causing serious injuries to many people, creating a bloody incident. This is indeed a cruel act that goes against humanity.</p>
<h3>Compensation for All Losses, Strict Punishment of Responsible Personnel</h3>
<p>We are all people who serve in the education sector. We cannot but protest seriously against the Hong Kong government's actions that infringe on Chinese sovereignty and violate humanitarianism. We cherish Britain's friendship with China, and we sincerely hope that British people will not easily damage this friendship. It must be known that maintaining the independence and integrity of Chinese sovereignty is the responsibility and obligation of every Chinese person. Regardless of political views or religious beliefs, the entire country is united in this determination. The British government must not disregard the unanimous will of our people to safeguard sovereignty simply because China is currently in internal turmoil. In addition to urging and waiting for the government to lodge a serious protest and negotiation, we hereby make the following demands on the British government: Compensate all losses of the residents in Kowloon Walled City. Immediately release the illegally arrested residents. Strictly punish the personnel responsible for this incident. Apologize to the Chinese government and people. Guarantee that similar incidents will not happen again in the future.</p>
<h3>Return Kowloon First to Eradicate Unfortunate Events</h3>
<p>Moreover, we have to say that the occurrence of this unfortunate incident was entirely caused by the dispute over the sovereignty of Kowloon Walled City. In order to eliminate the source of future disputes and promote friendly relations between China and Britain, we advocate that the British government should immediately return the leased territory of Kowloon. The establishment of leased territories was originally due to the weakness of the Qing government at the end of the 19th century, when various imperialist countries forcibly signed leases, and sovereignty still belonged to China. Now that our country is an independent and sovereign country, the leased territories of Jiaozhou and Guangzhou Bay have been recovered one after another, and Britain should also return the leased territory of Kowloon as soon as possible to eradicate the occurrence of unfortunate events in the future. As for Hong Kong, although it belongs to Britain, it is closely connected to southern China and has close and inseparable political, economic, and military ties with China. The British government should also hold negotiations with our government as soon as possible to return it to our country as soon as possible. In this way, not only will similar bloody incidents in Kowloon Walled City not happen again, but the relationship between China and Britain will also become closer. This is the declaration.</p>
<h3>University Representatives Protest to British Consulate and Petition the Chairman</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper News] The Shanghai University Student Groups United Association Protesting the Kowloon Incident yesterday issued a letter to the people of the whole country. At 3 p.m., nine representatives were sent to the British Consulate in Shanghai to present a letter of protest. Deputy Consul Zhi Leide received them. The protest letter pointed out the errors in the British government's diplomacy and put forward a number of oral protests and demands: Confirm that Hong Kong and Kowloon belong to China. The Chinese government should take back Hong Kong and Kowloon, and the British government should unconditionally cede them. Please the British government adopt diplomatic means to resolve the Hong Kong and Kowloon incident and immediately stop the brutal actions. Compensate the losses of the compatriots in Kowloon. Immediately release the two resident representatives. Please forward to the British government a satisfactory reply within one week; otherwise, they will respond to the current crisis with the spirit of the eight-year War of Resistance against Japan. The British government should not take advantage of the situation to attack, which is unjust. Zhi replied that the opinions of the Chinese people on the Kowloon incident should be conveyed to the British government by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. He was not clear about the truth of the incident and could not answer. After the representatives withdrew, they went to the Municipal Government at 4:30 p.m. and presented a letter to Mayor Wu and a letter to Chairman Chiang, asking Mayor Wu to forward the petition.</p>
<h3>A Message to the People of the Entire Nation</h3>
<p>Now, the Shanghai University student groups' joint announcement protesting the Kowloon Incident, a message to the people of the entire nation, the original text is recorded below: "Thanks to the government's firm leadership and the people's sacrifices and struggles, the war of resistance defeated the stubborn enemy, abolishing unequal treaties. However, due to the Communist bandits' two years of rebellion, inviting wolves into the house, burning, killing, looting, destroying sovereignty and territorial integrity, and persecuting and damaging the people's lives, the international status of the four powers has declined daily. The new foreigners' contempt and exploitation of us, the old humiliation has returned. Hong Kong and Kowloon, territories that should have been recovered by our country, the British government stubbornly occupies and refuses to relinquish. The Hong Kong government even puts on the face of old imperialism. It has already caused the Ping Shan Airport Incident, and now forcefully demolishes Chinese people's residences in Chinese territory, arresting residents' representatives, which is barbarous and unreasonable. When our countrymen hear of it, they are filled with righteous indignation and resentment. The students of Shanghai universities are even more uneasy because the nation's dignity has been violated and their compatriots have been trampled upon. Therefore, they urge Chairman Chiang to strengthen the suppression of the rebellion and national reconstruction, strengthen national defense capabilities, adopt strong diplomacy, and use force to recover Hong Kong and Kowloon. For all the losses suffered by our people in this Kowloon incident, we demand that the British government compensate immediately. We, the youth of the whole country, pledge to fight again at all costs to be the government's backing. At the same time, we issue a message to the people of the whole country, hoping that they will jointly demand that the government strengthen the suppression of the rebellion and national reconstruction, implement strong diplomacy, and immediately do everything possible to donate funds to comfort the residents of Kowloon. Compatriots, warlord separatism led to the invasion of Japanese pirates, and the Communist bandits' rebellion has caused a series of unfortunate events that have humiliated the nation and ceded territory, such as the Northeast, Northwest, and Kowloon. We must overthrow the Communist bandits in the same way that we overthrew the warlords in order to solve all external unfortunate events. We must have independent and autonomous strong diplomacy in order to protect our compatriots and combat the wild flames of all red and white imperialists."</p>

Entrusted by the National Sports Association of China to prepare for the World Games pre-selection in the Shanghai area. Preparing to hold the Shanghai-Hong Kong Inter-Port Competition, to be held in Hong Kong on the Lunar New Year's Day.</p>
<h3>World Games Pre-selection - Resolution of the Sports Association</h3>
<p>The National Sports Association of China, in order to prepare for the organization of a Chinese World Games football team, resolved at a plenary meeting of directors and supervisors last year: To hire Rong Qizhao, Zhou Jiaqi, Yu Hengzhi, Huang Jiajun, and Li Huitang as selection committee members, with myself as the chairman. In order to facilitate the participation of teams from Chinese compatriots in Singapore, the Philippines, Java, and Saigon in Southeast Asia in the pre-selection, and due to climate conditions, it was decided to hold pre-selections in two regions: Hong Kong and Shanghai. North China, Central China, West China, and East China will participate in the Shanghai region. The National Sports Association has financial difficulties, so it must hold competitions along the way when the football team goes abroad to participate in the meeting, and use ticket revenue to subsidize travel expenses. Therefore, the football team will go abroad early, so the pre-selection must be held in advance. Although the National Games are scheduled to be held on May 5, the Sports Association must prepare for any eventuality. The route of the football team out of the country is tentatively set to pass through the Philippines, Australia, New Zealand, and South America to reach the United Kingdom.</p>
<h3>Mission to Hong Kong - Negotiation Process</h3>
<p>My mission to Hong Kong and the negotiation process: In the capacity of Chairman of the Football Committee of the Shanghai Sports Association, I contacted the Hong Kong Football Association on matters related to the inter-port competition, accepted the Hong Kong side's opinions, and agreed that the Shanghai team would go to Hong Kong on the Lunar New Year's Day, and restore the previous method of hosting the home and away teams, that is, the home team is responsible for hosting, the visiting team raises its own travel expenses, and the ticket sharing system is cancelled, in order to conform to the purpose of the inter-port competition to connect friendship. In the capacity of Chairman of the World Games Football Representative Selection Committee of the National Sports Association, I consulted with Hong Kong committee members Huang Jiajun and Li Huitang on the World Games selection criteria.</p>
<h3>Football Representative - Selection Criteria</h3>
<p>The following selection criteria for football representatives were agreed upon: Those who have sportsmanship and obedience, and are sufficient to represent the country, Those who are young and strong, strive for progress, and can lead those who come later after returning to the country, Excellent skills.</p>
<h3>Hong Kong Side - Caused Misunderstanding</h3>
<p>The misunderstanding caused by my trip to Hong Kong was that I did not visit the heads of various football clubs and the Chinese Football Federation. The reason for this is that my qualifications and mission for going to Hong Kong have been described above. Since it has nothing to do with the football clubs, there is no need to visit them. The National Sports Association has directly sent a letter to the Hong Kong branch to report on the pre-selection matters, and since I am not a representative of the association, I have no opportunity to intervene. The Hong Kong Chinese Football Federation is also not directly affiliated with the National Sports Association of China. Furthermore, I should correct the suspicion that my conversation with reporters involved attacking individuals. I handle sports affairs purely out of interest, and have absolutely no ambition, let alone any conflict of interest with any individual. The reporter from the Hong Kong Sing Tao Daily newspaper asked me, and I only answered the news published with my personal opinion. As for the issue of Mr. Hu Jun of Hong Kong and Macau being superior, it is purely intentional rumor-mongering. I have never met Mr. Hu. Participating in the World Games is a matter of national prestige, and should be understood and supported by all parties. I hope that my comrades in the news media will provide more guidance and criticism.</p>
<h3>World Games Selection</h3>
<p>I handle affairs without prejudice, especially to ask for any detailed criticism in order to improve. I am very grateful for the article published in the Southeast Daily a few days ago, offering me a word of advice. The following is a summary of my reply: Sports are civilianized in the past, so it is now, and so it will be in the future. The National Games have been decided to be held, and the World Games pre-selection is a preparation for any eventuality. The football team must go abroad early due to travel expenses. The selection of World Games representatives is based on individual skills, not on the entire champion team. It is difficult for Central China and West China to participate in the pre-selection. The selection committee has already taken this into consideration. There are very few football talents in the above-mentioned regions, so it is also possible for one or two people to come to Shanghai to participate. Regarding the cooperation and venue issues for the Hong Kong pre-selection, Hong Kong Football Association Chairman Shi Gen has agreed to assist. If the Chinese compatriots in Hong Kong can put the nation first and eliminate personal opinions, they will naturally fully support it.</p>
<h3>Bank of Communications Sports Group - Celebration Party Tonight</h3>
<p>The Bank of Communications Colleagues Association Sports Group, under the promotion of organizers Li Zai, Ren Zu, and Wang Jiucheng, has achieved remarkable results and received special honors. Participating in external competitions, it has won three championships in a row, including: The Six-Team Cup sponsored by the Four Banks and Two Bureaus, The Shanghai Mini-Ball Indoor Group, The Silver Money Cup Basketball League, all of which won the overall championship.

<p>In the A1 group, Hualian vs. Shantou Team is the most exciting scene today. Hualian is the leader at sea, and Shantou is only a little bit behind. When the two teams meet again today, Shantou should increase its efforts.</p>

<h3>To Prevent Price Fluctuations During the Lunar New Year - The Authorities are Tightening the Money Supply - The Gold Control Bureau Conducts Emergency Inspections of Banks and Firms</h3>

<p>According to sources, in order to prevent price increases before and after the Lunar New Year, the financial authorities have decided to cooperate with various economic departments to tighten the money supply, continue to sell large quantities of goods, and strengthen the absorption of floating capital to prevent market fluctuations.</p>
<p>[This newspaper report] In order to prevent price fluctuations during the Lunar New Year, the Gold Control Bureau will implement emergency inspections of various banks and firms in the near future and is planning methods.

As of now, 50 commercial banks, 52 money houses, 6 foreign banks, 2 credit cooperatives, 1 provincial bank, and 4 trust companies have submitted the completed forms.</p>
<p>According to the person in charge of the Bureau, the above-mentioned emergency inspection is temporary, fearing that various banks and companies will engage in illegal activities during the Lunar New Year and stimulate prices. The general survey is fixed and will be conducted at least once a month to audit the use of remittances and loans, and will be carried out in batches by region.</p>
<p>Another dispatch: According to the person in charge of the Shanghai Financial Management Bureau, the Bureau's inspection of bank and firm operations is divided into four categories for the sake of strictness and prudence. One is investigation, which is to investigate unfinished matters in past operations; the second is rectification, which is to order banks and firms with poor credit to rectify so that the truth can be clarified and remedies can be made; the third is dishonored checks, which is to investigate the responsibility for dishonored checks to clarify whether there are speculative crimes; and the fourth is round-tripping of foreign exchange, which is to investigate whether there are speculative behaviors and to understand the source of floating capital.</p>

<h3>Continued Decline in Cotton Yarn and Cloth; 42-count Blue Phoenix Down 2 Million Compared to Previous Day</h3>
<p>Yesterday's cotton yarn market opened with a morning decline due to the impact of tight monetary conditions. Operators facing financial pressure reluctantly liquidated their positions, leading to a soft market sentiment. Numerous floating orders were resold, with most transactions being arbitrage-driven, resulting in a sluggish and spiritless market with a declining trend.</p>
<p>Ultimately, 42-count Blue Phoenix fine yarn experienced a sharp drop of 2 million yuan compared to the previous day, settling at 58.3 million yuan. Other counts of both coarse and fine yarn also saw price reductions ranging from 700,000 to 1.2 million yuan.</p>
<p>The cotton cloth market opened with a weak sentiment, and trading was sluggish. Prices were initially quoted lower across the board.

Prices for various grades of tea rose sharply. However, export tea remained sluggish due to the cautious approach of exporters. As for domestic tea, local merchants and buyers continued to seek supplies, and transaction volumes remained reasonably good.</p>
<h3>Soap Industry Association Meeting</h3>
<p>Request to Ban Imports of Industrial Soap [Report from this newspaper] The Fourth District Soap Industry Association held a meeting yesterday to discuss appealing to the authorities to ban imports of industrial soap. It was decided that the chairman of the association, Liang Songling, would meet with the newly appointed Chairman Huo Baoshu of the Import and Export Management Committee today to discuss the matter in detail before determining the association's position.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the association noted that the Finance Bureau recently announced a reduction of half the business tax for industries related to national defense and people's livelihoods. However, soap products, which are essential for daily life, were not included in the tax reduction. Therefore, the association will also attempt to submit separate appeals to relevant parties.</p>
<p>Guben Factory to Distribute Goods [Report from this newspaper] Amid rising soap prices, it is reported that the Guben factory is about to begin distributing goods to alleviate supply and demand issues. The intended distribution volume for Guben brand daily-use soap is reportedly set at 1.8 million. The market for daily-use soap saw significant sales yesterday due to high interest rates in the black market, leading to numerous holders releasing their stocks and lowering quoted prices. As a result, Jian brand and Ben brand soaps saw a sharp drop of 60,000 to 70,000 yuan, while other brands fell by 20,000 to 50,000 yuan. Matches also declined by 10,000 to 20,000 yuan, while kerosene remained stable.</p>
<p>Cigarettes Decline</p>
<p>Yesterday's cigarette market saw sluggish activity due to tight credit conditions. Bearish sentiment prevailed in the market, with continuous selling pressure from multiple sellers. As a result, ten packs of Old Knife brand cigarettes from British American Tobacco continued to fall by 300,000 to 450,000 yuan compared to the previous day. Prices for all other Chinese and foreign cigarettes declined across the board, ranging from 1,000 to over 10,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>Woolen Fabrics Sales Sluggish</h3>
<p>The standard prices for woolen fabrics remained firm, with both official and unofficial rates increasing. Dealers followed the lead of factories and remained optimistic. However, actual sales were slow across various regions and among different merchants, occurring earlier than in previous years. Recently, a piece of new Melton robe fabric costs approximately 3 million yuan, while slightly more presentable flannel for long gowns costs over 4 million yuan. A tailored suit averages 6 to 7 million yuan, and melton riding breeches and long-haired wool overcoats for women are priced around 6 million yuan, beyond the reach of ordinary people.</p>
<h3>High Costs of Tung Oil and Bristles; Exports Still Not Active</h3>
<p>Domestic prices of tung oil and bristles have recently risen due to the general increase in prices, leading to higher costs and making exports more difficult. The price of tung oil is 1.66 million yuan per market load in Chongqing, 2.27 million yuan in Hankou, 2.8 million yuan in Shanghai, 2.3 million yuan in Changsha, 1.82 million yuan in Wanxian, 2.28 million yuan in Wuzhou, and 2.666 million yuan in Guangzhou.</p>
<p>Due to weak year-end sales, the overseas selling price is US$0.2625 per pound for spot goods in New York, US$0.2525 per pound C&amp;F for electricity price in Hong Kong, and £186 per ton OFF for barrelled oil in London.</p>
<p>After the implementation of the Sino-Hong Kong agreement, tung oil smuggling to Hong Kong will inevitably decrease. However, goods already in Hong Kong and registered with the Hong Kong government are exempt from providing foreign exchange settlement certificates, so prices in Hong Kong are unlikely to rebound in the short term.</p>
<p>The price of bristles is 28 million yuan per customs load for Chongqing bristles. Washed and dressed grade 17 bristles from Hankou are quoted at 40 million yuan, but no transactions have occurred. Shanghai bristles are 28 million yuan.</p>
<p>Overseas market prices are US$8 per pound C&amp;F New York for Tianjin grade 55 and US$6 for small grade 55, both seller's offers with no transactions. Chongqing grade 27, paired in boxes, is US$2.2 per pound C&amp;F, with some small transactions occurring. London prices are CFF 14 shillings and 6 pence. Hankou and C&amp;F New York bristles are US$3.25, and Shanghai bristles are US$2.25, all remaining firm. However, due to rising domestic costs along with general price increases, exports have not been active.</p>
<h3>Japanese Cement Arrives in Hong Kong; Cement Association Asks for Strict Prevention of Smuggling</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] According to reliable information obtained by the National Cement Association, a large batch of over 14,000 bags of Japanese cement has recently arrived in Hong Kong, and more will continue to arrive. The association believes that Hong Kong's construction needs are very limited, and domestic cement brands such as Taishan, Xiang, and Wuyang already have ample supply. The ultimate destination of this batch of cement will undoubtedly be smuggling to various locations for sale. At a time when domestic cement supply exceeds demand and sales are extremely sluggish, the association is paying close attention to the movement of Japanese cement arriving in Hong Kong. It has telegraphed the Customs Administration and other responsible authorities, instructing customs offices along the coast to strictly prevent its smuggling into the country to prevent future problems.</p>

<h3>Essays and Language</h3>
<p>— Zhou Zumo</p>
<p>Language and literature are both tools for expressing thoughts, but they are not exactly the same. Language uses many sounds to express thoughts, while essays use writing to replace language, so they are different. When we speak, we can have different tones and pitches in our voices and words, and we can also express emotions and gestures to help others understand. These are not all completely expressible in essays. Therefore, Lu Ji's "Wen Fu" says, "I am always worried that the intention does not match the object, and the words do not express the intention." This is exactly the point. At the same time, on the receiver's side, essays are not as direct as language. The purpose of the essay, the truthfulness of the words, and the tone all need to be discerned and savored by the reader from the words, which inevitably adds another layer. Therefore, the effectiveness of essays is not necessarily the same as that of language.</p>
<p>However, although essays are different from language, they can never be separated from language and exist independently. It is putting the cart before the horse to discuss essays without language. Essays represent language, and language is the source of essays. Words and structures are all secondary matters. Looking at the essays of ancient people, the most brilliant ones are like speaking. All essays that are like speaking are also the most vivid. Even the dull narrative historical texts become more lively and engaging when dialogue is inserted. For example, Sima Qian often used this method in his writing of the "Records of the Grand Historian". In the "Biography of Lord Xinling" (Volume 77), almost half of the content is dialogue, which makes it extremely brilliant. There are also many direct records of spoken language. For example, in the "Biography of Zhou Chang" (Volume 96), when Zhou Chang advised Emperor Gao not to abolish the crown prince, it is said:</p>
<p>The Emperor wanted to abolish the crown prince and make Concubine Qi's son, Ruyi, the crown prince. The ministers strongly opposed it, but they could not prevail. Zhou Chang strongly argued in court. The Emperor asked him why. Chang stuttered and was very angry, saying, "I cannot speak well, but I know that it is impossible. Even if Your Majesty wants to abolish the crown prince, I will not obey the order." The Emperor smiled happily.</p>
<p>This vividly captures Zhou Chang's stuttering and repeating words. Also, the writings of Ru Lu in the Later Han Dynasty also have many parts that are simple and approachable. For example, in the "Biography of Fan Pang" (Volume 57), Wang Fu's interrogation of Fan Pang after he was imprisoned is written as follows:</p>
<p>As a subject, you do not show loyalty to the country, but instead create factions, praising each other and criticizing the court, fabricating groundless accusations. What do you want to do with all your conspiracies? Answer truthfully, and do not hide anything!</p>
<p>Although this is in four-character lines, it is all spoken language, and the scene of Wang Fu's sternness is fully expressed. From this, it can be seen that to make writing lively and smooth, one must pay attention to actual language.</p>
<p>Conversely, when we read the essays in the "New Book of Tang," we always feel that there are too many places where the writing is not smooth. Therefore, Wang Ruoxu's "Hunan Relics Collection" contains "Critiques of the New Book of Tang" (Volumes 22 to 24), which specifically attacks its shortcomings. For example, the "Biography of Linghu Defen" in the "Old Book of Tang" says:</p>
<p>Emperor Gaozong often summoned the chancellors and scholars of the Hongwen Pavilion and asked, "How does one cultivate to become a king? How does one cultivate to become a hegemon? Which comes first?" Defen replied, "If you want to implement them, the way of the king is the best, but it is difficult to implement." Emperor Gaozong said, "What is the most important policy to implement now?" But the "New Book of Tang" changed it to:</p>
<p>The Emperor asked, "How does one cultivate to become a king? How does one cultivate to become a hegemon? Which often comes first?" He replied, "If you use them, the way of the king comes first, but it is the most difficult." The Emperor said, "What is the most important thing to do now?"</p>
<p>Comparing the two, it is natural to see how strange and obscure Song Qi's writing is, and how it does not conform to grammar. This is exactly the opposite of what was mentioned earlier, and it is the problem of essays being divorced from language.</p>
<p>Today's writing styles are divided into classical Chinese and vernacular Chinese. Some people still think that writing in classical Chinese has its own grammar, which is different from the colloquial vernacular. Essays must be elegant to be considered good. But this is only one side of the view. If we recognize that essays should be close to language, we will naturally find that ancient essays, except for the difference in function words and vocabulary and the sounds of modern language, still use the grammar of speaking in terms of syntax. It is a mistake to discuss grammar without language. Because the habitual usage in language is grammar. It is in line with grammar to use language. The current language has been passed down from the Qin Dynasty, and although the pronunciation is different from ancient times, the arrangement of words in the language (i.e., Syntax) has not changed much. In ancient times, writing tools were difficult to use, so the sentences were concise and difficult to understand, such as the Book of Documents and some of the bronze inscriptions, which are not as clear and easy to understand as later sentences. This is inevitable and can be ignored. However, the articles after the Spring and Autumn Period were much clearer. For example, the "Analects" is more than two thousand years old, but it is still readable today because it is based on the Lu language of that time. Not only are the word order the same, but even the auxiliary words in the language are written out one by one, almost like speaking. This shows that essays must be attached to language in order to be</p>
<p>However, the styles of writing have changed greatly over the dynasties. Some people like to take the law from above and learn the articles of the Han and Wei dynasties, which is not wrong; however, they must be selective. There are many difficult articles by the Han people, but there are also shallow ones. The main purpose of the article is to convey meaning, and there is no need to be difficult. For example, the imperial edict recorded in the "Book of Han·Emperor Wen Ji" says:</p>
<p>The way to govern the people lies in focusing on agriculture. I have personally led the farmers of the world for ten years, but the fields have not been expanded. If the year is not good, the people will be hungry. This is because there are few happy events and the officials have not worked hard enough. I have issued decrees several times, urging the people to plant trees every year, but the work has not been done well. This is because the officials do not diligently follow my decrees and do not clearly persuade the people. Moreover, our farmers are very bitter, but the officials do not care about them. How can they be encouraged? Half of this year's rent and taxes will be given to the farmers.</p>
<p>Also, the "Treatise on Criminal Law" records Emperor Wen's edict abolishing corporal punishment: I have heard that in the time of Yu, people were punished by drawing clothes and wearing different clothes and ornaments, but the people did not commit crimes. What a great governance it was! Now there are three corporal punishments in the law, but adultery does not stop. Where is the blame? Is it not because of my thin virtue and unclear teaching? I am very ashamed. Therefore, the training is not pure, and the foolish people are trapped. The poem says: "Kind gentlemen, parents of the people." Now people have committed crimes, but education has not been implemented and punishment has already been added. Or they want to change their behavior for the better, but there is no way to go. I feel very sorry for them. Corporal punishment to cut off limbs, carve muscles and skin, and never stop for a lifetime. How painful is this punishment and how unkind is it? How can it be called "parents of the people"! Abolish corporal punishment and replace it with something else.</p>
<p>These are all first-class clear and straightforward texts. Therefore, Liu Xizai said in the "Yigai," "The most unattainable of Western Han texts is Emperor Wen's edict. The Book of Zhou's "Lv Xing" is considered by commentators to be sad and compassionate, and the meaning of the loyalty and kindness of the three dynasties can still be imagined. However, they only reached the form, not the essence. How can it be compared to Emperor Wen's emotions that reached the essence and created the text?" However, what Liu said, "Emotions reach the essence and create the text" means that the words are all true, pouring out the heart, and the resulting sentence is language, so it is naturally beautiful. The ancients said, "Cultivate the words and establish its sincerity," and also said, "Words convey the meaning." This is what they meant.</p>
<p>However, after the Qi and Liang dynasties, parallel prose became popular, which was a major change in the style of writing. However, famous writers still paid attention to the fluency of the writing in addition to paying attention to the rhythm and style. Down to the Sui and Tang dynasties, those who wrote parallel prose abused the idioms of the ancients and widely cited stories to show their erudition. As a result, the essay was separated from the language. Not only was the narrative unclear, but it was also lifeless. Therefore, until Han Yu advocated the revival movement, he removed the accumulated habits. The so-called "revival" is to restore the ancient way of writing essays, not to copy the words of the ancients, but to imitate their appearance. This made the essay embark on a clear and smooth path. Han Yu replied to Li Yi in his "Essay on Essays":</p>
<p>Qi is water, and words are floating objects. When the water is large, the floating objects, large and small, will float. The relationship between qi and words is the same. When the qi is strong, the length and sound of the words will be appropriate.</p>
<p>The "qi" he said is the "qi" of "righteous and strong." "Words" are the "words" of "what you want to say" in your heart. The utterance of language is all created by the breath, that is, "qi" carries "words". Moreover, everyone has a consistent tone when speaking. When the tone is strong, the words are also strong. When the tone is smooth, the words are also smooth. Then it is obvious that writing must correspond to the tone. In the past, ancient essayists knew this in their hearts, but they never made it clear. The ancient essayists of the Song Dynasty, such as Ouyang Xiu and Su Shi, were indeed masters, and they were also cultivated gradually. Their skills were so deep that they could "be slow and complete, repeating hundreds of times, but the passages were clear and smooth without interruption." They could "be leisurely and easy, without difficulty and hard work" (see Su Xun's "Letter to Ouyang Neihan"). But it was also because they had read Han Yu's articles for a long time that they realized the relationship between essays and language.</p>
<p>I do not intend to praise the Eight Great Masters of the Tang and Song Dynasties here. In fact, the Eight Great Masters are enough to represent those who can write essays according to the consistent method of "text" and "words" of the ancients. Therefore, from Mao Lumen and Tang Jingchuan of the late Ming Dynasty to the essayists of the Tongcheng School of the Qing Dynasty, they all attached great importance to the Eight Great Masters, which was not without reason. As for Li Mengyang's revival in the Ming Dynasty, his writing was like felling wood and viewing stones, only for later generations to laugh at. In the past, Mr. Zhang Taiyan liked to imitate the texts of the Qin and Han Dynasties and before in his early years. His articles were full of ancient characters and the language was concise and obscure. However, in his later years, he still believed that beginners should start with the Eight Great Masters. Moreover, his own works, such as the articles collected in the "Supplement to the Zhang's Series," have also changed from the old to the simple and elegant. This shows that Mr. Zhang fully understood and discerned the right path of military writers from experience, which is in line with reason. In this way, although the styles of writing have changed in history, the beauty and ugliness of essays, in addition to revision, must first look at whether they are similar to language. Those that do not correspond to language are mostly not worth following.</p>
<p>In short, no matter what style of essay you write, being fluent and clear, like speaking, is the first priority. Stiffness and unnaturalness that do not conform to language habits are all inappropriate.</p>
<p>Respectfully because the tribute envoy is going, the memorial is not appropriate, respectfully stated.</p>
<p>August 15th, Acting Knowledge Guiyi Army Military Horse Left Behind, Defender of Shazhou Changshi. Yinqing Guanglu Dafu, Jianjiao Ministry of Rites Shangshu.</p>
<p>Also Yushi Dafu, Shangzhu Kingdom Cao Rengui states. (Upper bell "Shazhou Jiedushi Seal",)</p>
<p>It can be seen that before Cao Yijin, there was a generation of Cao Rengui. According to Jiu Wudai Shi Thirty-one Zhuang Zong Ji Tongguang Second Year May Yichou: "Cao Yijin, the left behind of Quan Zhi Guiyi Army, was made the Jiedushi Shazhou Thorn History Jianjiao Sikong," and Ce Fu Yuan Gui 980 also said that "Cao Yijin, the Shazhou Weishi in Tongguang, sent envoys to pay tribute," Cao Rengui and Cao Yijin were both left behind and Changshi, but Cao Rengui was Jianjiao Ministry of Rites Shangshu, while Cao Yijin was added Jianjiao Sikong by the imperial court. Furthermore, according to the general naming convention, the generation before Yi is often the character Ren, and there are very few cases where the generation before Ren is the character Yi. There is also a lot of evidence that Yuan De and Yuan Zhong were the sons of Yijin, so it is undoubtedly that Rengui was the previous generation of Yijin, and Yijin was the successor of Rengui.</p>

<h3>Mr. Qian Xuantong's Posthumous Letter</h3>
<p>Zhizhi:</p>
<p>In the New Annotation of the Book of Songs, the issue of "rhyme," I think can simply be ignored. Because -</p>
<p>We can only examine whether a certain character rhymes with another character in ancient times, or whether they do not rhyme, but we cannot determine how a certain rhyme was pronounced. For example, we know that the "xia" and "nü" of the last chapter of "Picking Watercress" rhymed in the ancient "mo" rhyme, but we cannot determine that this "mo" rhyme is pronounced the same as "X" sound now.</p>
<p>Even if we reluctantly assume it, since the current pronunciation is not like this, it has nothing to do with the syllables of the poems in the Book of Songs.</p>
<p>Moreover, the ancient and modern different pronunciations of these rhyming characters have no impact on the art of poetry.</p>
<p>Therefore, I feel that this matter can be ignored. However, it seems that the difficult characters in the Book of Songs, or those that do not follow the ordinary pronunciation in a certain poem, should be noted for their pronunciation. I think it is best to use phonetic alphabet to note the modern pronunciation — the so-called national pronunciation. "Cheng" is pronounced "　　"; "Nu ru tiao　" of "Tiao" is pronounced "　　"; "Wei she" in Lamb is pronounced "　　　". This is because it is prepared for middle school students to read, so rare characters and rare pronunciations are noted for their pronunciation. Do you agree with this idea?</p>
<p>After you have completed this annotation, I would like to offer a short preface. In this short preface, all "nonsense" will not be said, only one thing will be stated: "Mao" is "mo", "tong" is "shou", and "　" and "xie" in the Peiping poem will be explained in detail, and I think there will be many new annotations of this kind in the future. This layer will definitely arouse the opposition of a group of "inflexible" gentlemen. But I think this is really a revolution for the vulgar annotations said by scholars since the Han and Tang Dynasties. The ancient meaning must be "cleared through the fog to see the blue sky" by using this method. This method is -</p>
<p>Seek the meaning of words from the sound, not being bound by the shape of the characters.</p>
<p>Certify the ancient meaning with modern language.</p>
<p>Since Huang Sheng, Qian Daxin, Wang Niansun and his son invented the method, they have clarified many ancient meanings. Master Zhang Taiyan made a new dialect and invented the method, and clarified many ancient meanings. We must use this method to read ancient books now, and I will use this method, so I plan to write a short preface to commend it, one is to prove that you have used this method to explain many meanings of the characters in the Book of Songs, and the other is to indicate that readers must use this method to verify the difficult-to-understand meanings of the characters in ancient books. What do you think?</p>

<h3>On "Arranging Music Sequences"</h3>
<p>— Ge Jin'e</p>
<p>Mr. Zhizhi:</p>
<p>My work "Arranging Music Sequences" was published in Shenbao Literature and History Issues 2 and 3 (December 13th and 20th), which I deeply appreciate. However, there are a few points that need to be stated and corrected: 1. It is true that the article says "Mr. Lu did not indicate what version of the Wulin Old Affairs he cited." But then it says, "If we compare several versions of Wulin Old Affairs, we can know that the one he used must be the glossy paper version of the Shanghai Progressive Bookstore." This is probably not my original text. If it is my original text, I also admit that this is my mistake. Because the glossy paper version of the Progressive Bookstore is the same as the Zhizhuzu Studio edition. I have now found the basis for the text cited by Mr. Lu, which was indirectly cited from Mr. Xu Zhiheng's History of Opera (lecture notes printed by the Peking University Publishing Group). However, Mr. Lu only cited the "text" and did not cite the "punctuation." I don't know what this means. Just in terms of text, Mr. Lu did not correct any omissions or unclear places in Xu's History. Therefore, I said, "If you rely on such a version (referring to Xu's History) without consulting other versions for comparison, then Mr. Lu should be held responsible for all the errors in it." 2. The above article was originally sent to the Shanghai Dagong Bao "Literature and History" edited by Mr. Because I saw that Dagong Bao "Literature and History" was suspended, my article was not published, and I thought that this article might not be published. At that time, Mr. Luo Genze asked me for contributions, and because I had already discovered that Mr. Lu's basis was Xu Zhiheng's History of Opera lecture notes, I revised the above article and submitted it to Mr. Luo for publication in the 67th issue of the "Literature and History Bureau Journal" of the Nanjing Central Daily on November 10th. I did not "submit one article to two journals" and deliberately violate the "editing ban". I hereby declare this together. I respectfully wish you editorial success, Lu Jin'e (December 15th)</p>
<h3>Historical Materials on the Power Transition Between the Zhang and Cao Families in Shazhou During the Tang and Five Dynasties</h3>
<p>— Lao Gan</p>
<p>Shazhou in Hexi, during the Tang Dynasty, fell to the Tubo in the first year of Zhenyuan (785). In the fifth year of Dazhong (851), Zhang Yichao recovered it and became the Jiedushi of the Guiyi Army. It was passed down to his nephews, Huaishen and his brothers, and his grandnephew, Zhang Chengfeng. During Zhang Chengfeng's time, he proclaimed himself the White-Clad Son of Heaven of the Xihan Jinshan Kingdom. During the Zhenming period of the Zhu Liang Dynasty (915-920), the Zhang family's regime transitioned to the Cao family. According to Luo Zhenyu's "Supplementary Biography of Zhang Yichao of the Tang Dynasty" (from the manuscript of Yongfeng Xiangren) and the "Chronological Table of the Cao Family in Gua and Sha" (revised edition from Qijing Kan Congkan), the Zhang family ended with Zhang Chengfeng, and the Cao family began with Cao Yijin. Afterward, it passed through Cao Yuande, Cao Yuanshen, Cao Yuanzhong, Cao Yangong, Cao Yanlu, Cao Zongshou, and Cao Xianshun. In the fourth year of the Song Dynasty's Huangyou period (1052), they severed their tributary relations with the central court (according to the Song Huiyao). Furthermore, according to the "History of the Song Dynasty, Biography of Xixia," Xixia had already captured the three prefectures of Gua, Sha, and Su in the second year of Jingyou (1035). There is a slight discrepancy here. Combining these two sources, it appears that Xixia only captured a portion of Gua and Sha in the second year of Jingyou, not the entirety, which is why they were still able to pay tribute until the fourth year of Huangyou. Additionally, according to fragments from the Dunhuang Stone Chamber, there is a remnant calendar book from the second year of Jiayou (1057), which is the last year of Chinese rule in Dunhuang that can be ascertained from existing materials. As to whether it completely fell that year, that cannot be proven.</p>
<p>The Zhang family made significant contributions to Dunhuang, and their regime lasted for more than sixty years. During this time, there was a year when it was usurped by Suo Xun, Zhang Yichao's son-in-law, but eventually, it was seized back by Li, another son-in-law of Zhang Yichao, and returned to the Zhang family. As for the circumstances of the transition between the Zhang and Cao families, that is now unclear. According to Zhang Huaiqing's eulogy from the Dunhuang manuscripts copied by Hada Toru, Zhang Huaiqing was from the Nanyang Zhang clan and belonged to the same lineage as Zhang Yichao. The eulogy contains the line, "[ ] King appears, Your Excellency attends in time, assisting closely, paying tribute to your majesty." His official title was "Former Guiyi Army Yingguan Nei Yamen Du Yaya." (The "[ ] King" should be Cao Yijin, who referred to himself as Tuoxi Great King in the Yulin and Mogao Caves. Qiaojun was the ancestral seat of the Cao family.) This suggests that at the time of the rise of the Cao family, there were still members of the Zhang family serving as his close confidants. It seems that the transition between the Cao and Zhang families occurred in a peaceful manner, rather than through a military usurpation.</p>
<p>According to the Zhang Family Meritorious Deeds Record from the Dunhuang manuscripts, Zhang Yichao and Zhang Yitan both died in Chang'an. Yichao had no sons, and Yitan's son, Huaishen, later succeeded Yichao, but his family and friends were probably all in Chang'an. Therefore, after the death of Huaishen's brother, there was only one orphan left, namely Zhang Chengfeng (according to the Li clan's re-inscription of the Meritorious Deeds Stele: "Brother died, younger brother passed, the state tottered, entrusting the orphan, barely escaping hardship." and "Re-illuminating the heir, restoring the surviving grandson."). It is not clear whether Zhang Chengfeng had any heirs. Considering various collateral evidence, Zhang Chengfeng seems to have had no heirs, and figures like Zhang Huaiqing were distant relatives.</p>
<p>Suo Xun and Li Mingzhen were both sons-in-law of Zhang Yichao, but Suo Xun was killed, and Li Mingzhen had already died. Moreover, for Zhang Chengfeng, the Suo and Li families were no longer considered close relatives. Huaishen's son-in-law seems likely to have been Cao Yijin's father. The inscription of the first donor on the north wall of Cave 42 of the Thousand Buddha Caves reads:</p>
<p>The deceased maternal grandfather, former Jiedushi of the eleven prefectures of Hexi, Commissioner of Inspection, Commander of Pacification, Director of Defense, Commander of Farming... (missing middle section) Marquis of Ten Thousand Households, bestowed with a purple fish pouch, Supreme Pillar of the State (missing bottom section)</p>
<p>Furthermore, the inscription of the eighth female donor on the east wall of Cave 75 reads:</p>
<p>The deceased maternal grandmother, Lady Yin of Wuwei Commandery, offering devoutly.</p>
<p>And the inscription of the third female donor on the south wall of Cave 42 reads:</p>
<p>The deceased (maternal) grandmother, Grand Lady Yin of Wuwei</p>
<p>This cave was constructed by the Cao family. The male inscription holder's official title was an official title from the time of the Zhang family's rule in Hexi, and according to other evidence, Huaishen's wife was a member of the Yin family. Therefore, Huaishen was Cao's maternal grandfather (this is based on Mr. Xiang Jueming's transcription and argument from his "Notes on the Western Expedition"). Thus, the Cao family was a closer relative of the Zhang family during Zhang Chengfeng's time than the Suo and Li families were.</p>
<p>Jiang Fu's copy of the "Sand State Archives" contains Cao Rengui's Mid-Autumn Memorial, which states:</p>
<p>May your Excellency's honored body be in excellent health. As of today, Rengui has received grace, but has not yet been able to pay respects in person. My humble feelings of reverence have increased. I humbly request your examination.</p>
<h3>Chi Yizi Pi Was Not Fan Li</h3>
<p>— Wang Shumin</p>
<p>The "Fan Lun" chapter of the Huainanzi states: "In the past, Duke Jian of Qi relinquished the reins of his state and entrusted them entirely to senior ministers and generals. They usurped authority and formed factions for their own benefit, and justice was not done. Thus, Chen Cheng and Tian Chang, along with Chi Yizi Pi, were able to accomplish their difficulties."</p>
<p>Qian Daxin stated: "The assertion that Chi Yizi Pi was a member of Tian Chang's faction is not found in other books. According to historical records, Yue had not yet conquered Wu in the year that Tian Chang assassinated the ruler. How could Fan Li have entered Qi? This is an error in the Huainanzi." (Ten Carriages Studio, Cultivating New Records, vol. 12)</p>
<p>My view is that Qian's statement is incorrect. According to the "Biographies of the Money-Makers" in the Historical Records, "After Fan Li wiped away the shame of Kuaiji, he sighed and said, 'Of Ji Ran's seven strategies, Yue employed five and achieved success. Having already applied them to the state, I wish to use them for my family.' Thereupon, he sailed in a small boat on the Five Lakes, changing his name and surname, and went to Qi, becoming [ ] ." This is how Sima Qian identified Fan Li as Chi Yizi Pi, which is the basis of Qian's statement. However, Chi Yizi Pi was not Fan Li. The fact that Chi Yizi Pi was part of Tian Chang's faction is also repeatedly mentioned in other books. The earliest instance is in the "Against Confucianism, Part 2" of the Mozi, which states:</p>
<p>"Confucius was resentful towards Duke Jing and Yanzi, and thus planted Chi Yizi Pi at the gate of Tian Chang." The statement that Confucius planted Chi Yizi Pi at the gate of Tian Chang may be a [ ] expression. But the fact that there was a person named Chi Yizi Pi at the gate of Tian Chang aligns with what is written in the Huainanzi, so it is not a false claim. Another instance can be found in the "Sayings from the Forest, Part 1" of the Han Feizi, which states:</p>
<p>"Chi Ti Zipi served Tian Chengzi. When Tian Chengzi left Qi and fled to Yan, Chi Yizi Pi carried the luggage and followed him. Upon reaching Wangyi, Zipi said, 'Have you not heard of the snake in the dried-up swamp? When the swamp dries up, the snake will move. A small snake said to a large snake, "If you go and I follow, people will only think the snake is moving, and someone will definitely kill you. It's better to bite and carry me as you go, and people will think I am a divine lord." ' They bit and carried each other, avoiding the public road as they traveled. People all avoided them, saying, 'A divine lord!' Now you are handsome, and I am ugly. If you are considered my honored guest, you are the lord of a thousand chariots. If you are considered my envoy, you are a minister of ten thousand chariots. It is better for you to be my attendant." Tian Chengshi carried the luggage and followed him. Upon arriving at an inn, the lord of the inn treated him with great respect and offered him wine and meat."</p>
<p>This passage recounts in detail Chi Yizi Pi's association with Tian Chang's flight to Yan, which proves that there was a person named Chi Yizi Pi at the gate of Tian Chang, and can verify that the Huainanzi's claim is not an error. Another instance can be found in the "Arts of a Minister" chapter of the Shuo Yuan, which states:</p>
<p>"Chen Chengzi said to Chi Yizi Pi, 'What is your relationship with Chang?' The reply was, 'If the lord dies, I will not die; if the lord perishes, I will not perish.' Chen Chengshi said, 'Then how do you serve Chang?' The reply was, 'To leave death before one dies, to leave ruin before one perishes. What death or ruin is there in that?' To obey commands that benefit the lord is called compliant; to obey commands that harm the lord is called flattery. To disobey commands that benefit the lord is called loyalty; to disobey commands that harm the lord is called rebellion. If the lord has faults and one does not remonstrate, it will endanger the state and destroy the altars of the soil and grain. One who can fully speak to the lord, if he is used, he remains; if he is not used, he leaves. This is called remonstrance. If he is used, he lives; if he is not used, he dies. This is called disputation. One who can harmonize and unite, leading the masses to correct the lord together, even if the lord is uneasy, he cannot help but listen, and thus alleviates the great troubles of the state and removes the great harm to the state, achieving the veneration of the lord and the peace of the state, this is called [ ]. One who can defy the lord's commands, reverse the lord's actions, and seize the lord's army to secure the state from danger, remove the lord's disgrace, and wage war to achieve the great benefits of the state, is called an assistant. Therefore, those who remonstrate, dispute, assist, and support are ministers of the state. A wise lord honors and respects them, while a foolish lord considers them enemies. Thus, what a wise lord rewards is what a foolish lord kills. A wise lord loves to ask questions, while a foolish lord loves to be alone. A wise lord elevates the worthy and employs the capable, enjoying their accomplishments; a foolish lord fears the worthy and is jealous of the capable, destroying their achievements, punishing the loyal and rewarding the rebellious. This is called utter [ ], the reason why Jie and Zhou perished. The Book of Odes says, "Never listen to them, and the great mandate will collapse." This is what it means.' This passage recounts in detail Chi Yizi Pi's discussion with Tian Chang about 'If the lord dies, I will not die; if the lord perishes, I will not perish,' which proves that there was a person named Chi Yizi Pi at the gate of Tian Chang, and also verifies that the Huainanzi's claim is not an error. Another instance can be found in the "Pointing to Weapons" chapter, which states:</p>
<p>"Tian Chengzi Chang was arguing with Zai Wo. Zai Wo ambushed soldiers at night, intending to attack Tian Chengzi, and ordered the soldiers, 'Do not rise unless you see the signal flag.' Chi Yizi Pi revealed this and informed Tian Chengzi. Tian Chengzi then used the signal flag to raise Zai Wo's soldiers and attack him, and thus destroyed him." This passage recounts Chi Yizi Pi's and Tian Chang's attack on Zai Wo, which also proves that there was a person named Chi Yizi Pi at the gate of Tian Chang. Therefore, all the Chi Yizi Pis mentioned in various books and the Huainanzi are not Fan Li who went from Yue to Qi. According to the "Arts of a Minister" chapter of the Shuo Yuan,</p>
<p>"Chi Yizi Pi relied on Qu Chun, and Sun Po was his friend. The intelligence of these two men was enough to make them prime ministers, but they did not dare display their intelligence and instead entrusted it to Qu Chun."</p>
<p>This shows that he was alive during the reign of King Ping of Chu, clearly distinguishing him as a different person from Fan Li. However, why did Sima Qian refer to Fan Li as Chi Yizi Pi? There must have been a reason. Based on the evidence cited above, Chi Yizi Pi was indeed a person of "great intelligence and suspicion." Perhaps after Fan Li left Yue, he compared himself to Chi Yizi Pi, and Sima Qian adopted this into his writings?</p>
<p>The records in the Mozi, Han Feizi, and Shuo Yuan can all corroborate the Huainanzi's claim. Qian carelessly glossed over the facts and hastily declared the Huainanzi to be in error. Once a mistake is made, it is difficult for superiors to avoid criticism. (Written at the end of the thirty-sixth year while visiting Jinling)</p>

<h3>Fireside Chats</h3>
<p>— He Ku</p>
<p>On cold winter nights, breath turns to frost. After sitting at a desk for a long time, a cup of malted milk seems to ease the chill. A poetic line says, "On a cold night, a guest arrives, treat him like wine." At this moment, I experience the meaning of that poem; drinking a cup of hot tea can warm the whole body. Actually, when a guest arrives on a cold night, why not drink wine? The best situation is to have a roaring fireplace. Warming oneself by the fireplace while chatting closely is one of life's joys.</p>
<p>Of course, a fireplace is the most ideal. My own room originally had a fireplace installed, but because it was sealed off during the war years, the chimney was blocked. Also, with the continuous increase in the number of people, it became increasingly inadequate as a bedroom. It became a kind of mixed-use room. Finally, in order to gain this bit of extra space, I removed the fireplace. Now, the space once occupied by the fireplace is now occupied by a small cabinet, and even the lingering charm of the fireplace cannot be recalled.</p>
<p>The other day, I went to a friend's house. Not only did he have Nandina and winter plum on his desk, but he also had a charcoal brazier for warming hands. The burning charcoal was warm and radiant, filling the room with spring. The room's rustic elegance was just right. Did the owner perhaps achieve a sense of serenity in the ordinary? Having a charcoal brazier for warmth may be common in the north, but in today's war-torn conditions, it may be difficult. If it is in the south, where transportation is difficult today, installing a fireplace is not something you or I can do easily. Therefore, having a charcoal brazier to warm hands can be considered satisfying.</p>
<p>The most desirable thing, of course, is a fireplace burning firewood. When humans long for the past, they often gain relaxing and comfortable memories. I am no exception. Last winter, I went to a friend's house for dinner several times. Their family had a usable fireplace. The host split cedar wood to start the fire. Several people sat around peeling melon seeds and walnuts. The burning wood made crackling sounds, as if sparks were about to fly out of the fireplace. The faces of all of us were illuminated by the warm firelight, turning them into a bright, light crimson, like a light buzz after tasting fine wine. The night was late and the evening wore on. It was a very pleasant night. There is a Western saying, "Splitting wood and starting a fire with your own hands can warm you twice." I think the best environment for splitting wood for warmth is a fireplace. A person warming himself by the fireplace not only gains warmth, but can also feel as if he is falling back into the era of "the good old days."</p>
<p>Of course, in today's devastated and starving cities, we don't hope to enjoy excessive pleasures. Having enough to eat and wearing warm clothes is already not easy. Wanting to warm oneself by a fireplace, although it is a pleasure that life should offer, still carries a hint of luxury today. Be mindful of danger in times of peace. We are fortunate to be able to occasionally warm ourselves with a charcoal brazier at this time and in this place.</p>
<h3>My Love of Reading</h3>
<p>— Jin Jin</p>
<p>Humans are selfish and self-serving animals, always starting from "the self." My writing about my love of reading here cannot escape the fault of egoism, as I am expounding on my "brilliant views," which may just be other people's "biases" or "narrow views."</p>
<p>I love Amy Lowell's poems, John Dos Passos's novels, and I haven't yet discovered a favorite writer in terms of essays.</p>
<p>Amy Lowell was an American female poet, born at the beginning of the 20th century, and died about twenty years ago. I used to collect some materials about her life, but they were all scattered due to accidents. She excels at writing love poems, using delicate language and profound meaning as her specialties. With a woman's delicate style, she expresses the highest love between men and women. I first encountered her works in Beiping and finished reading all four or five volumes of her poetry collections. After coming south, I searched for her collections in various bookstores and secondhand bookshops, but I could never buy them. The only thing I could find was one or two works in poetry selections. If I remember correctly, perhaps "The Golden Treasury" also includes her masterpiece.</p>
<p>I used to be able to recite her poems, reciting them fluently, but now, due to the busyness of life, I have forgotten most of them. However, I still remember the general idea of one poem, which shows her general conception. Her poem says that there was a painter who was painting a picture of the sun, but after the lover came, the sun faded. Why? The original poem does not explain. I think the clever readers can certainly guess that the original poem is praising the lover's brilliance, which makes the sun pale in comparison.</p>
<p>In terms of the types of poems, her works can be classified as Symbolist. She had a great deal of knowledge of Eastern learning. She once mentioned the Chinese poetry saint Li Bai in a poem, saying that the strangeness in his poems came from the strange scenes he saw after drinking. She gave an explanation for the reason for the fame of the number one genius in the poetry world, which is not without considerable meaning.</p>
<p>Speaking of John Dos Passos, he is another novelist whom I admire privately. This writer of the vast, million-word "U.S.A." trilogy (The 42nd Parallel, 1919, The Big Money) has made [ ] achievements in his use of words and psychological analysis. I follow the characters in the book, singing and weeping with them. Some of the descriptions made me cry.</p>
<p>John himself is an honorary graduate of Harvard University. He participated in World War I, and his book "Three Soldiers," published in 1921, was based on his wartime experiences and has since been considered the standard of war literature.</p>
<p>In addition to my private admiration for literary books, in terms of my "profession" - economics - I very much like to read Stuart Chase's articles. Chase's writing style is lively and full of passion, with thorough and detailed reasoning. He emphasizes "practicality" everywhere and does not engage in empty talk. This is another characteristic of his works.</p>
<p>Chase's academic background is as follows: he studied accounting and engineering at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology early in his career, and later specialized in economics at Harvard University. Afterward, he performed accounting work for private companies and government agencies for fourteen years. He is the author of "Men and Machines," "Mexico," and other books, and often has articles published in various popular magazines in the United States.</p>
<p>Finally, I would like to present another book, titled "Commonsense Speculation." It was written by someone under the name of "Insider" and published by Barron's, a financial publisher in New York. It is a book written for merchants, and the writing is not good. Moreover, there are places where the grammar is incorrect. However, if the reader is interested in speculation, or wants to know some common knowledge in this area, it is worth reading. My final statement is: My introduction of this book is not to encourage speculation. Anyway, speculation has been strictly prohibited by the authorities and can no longer cause trouble.</p>
<h3>Abandoned Funds</h3>
<p>— Dao Xian</p>
<p>People are sometimes quite forgetful, and some people even forget the money they have in the bank. These "abandoned funds" in American banks amount to as much as 250 million US dollars. Even people who buy lottery tickets and win forget to claim the prize. Residents of New York City had as much as 40,000 US dollars in cash sealed in "dead letters" in 1946. This is because they forgot to write the sender's address or wrote the wrong address. There are 500,007 packages across the United States that cannot be delivered because of incorrect addresses. These packages contain valuable Persian lambskin, seventeen-jewel watches, and cameras.</p>
<p>People work hard and save money by eating frugally, putting a little money in the bank. They should never forget these deposits. But as of March 31, 1945, New York State received 4,731,000 dollars in unclaimed deposits from banks. New Jersey received 800,000 dollars, and Kentucky received about 400,000 dollars.</p>
<p>Chase Bank in New York finally found a female depositor, but she herself did not remember ever having entered the bank's door. But the signature was exactly the same, proving that the deposit was indeed hers.</p>
<p>Many of the "abandoned" deposits are secretly deposited by husbands and wives without letting the other know, and in the end, he or she forgets the money themselves. There are also some deposits that people made when they were children, forgot when they grew up, and never touched throughout their lives. Some people deposit money for their children, but forget to explain this clearly when they pass away.</p>
<p>The laws of thirty-six states in the United States deal with the issue of abandoned funds. For example, in New York State, if a deposit is unclaimed for more than fifteen years, it reverts to the state. South Carolina stipulates that if a deposit is unclaimed for more than five years, it is transferred to the fund for state universities. Minnesota's deadline is twenty years.</p>
<p>Although the law strictly stipulates how to deal with abandoned funds, people are still forgetful as usual. The total amount of these abandoned funds is now enough to cover the one-year expenses of Delaware, Utah, Wyoming, Mississippi, Colorado, and Arkansas.</p>
<p>There are also many people who forget the deposits for public utilities such as telephone, gas, and electricity. Accumulated over many years, this is also a considerable amount. For example, by the end of 1946, Consolidated Edison of New York had accumulated $3.35 million in unclaimed deposits, all of which were transferred to the state government.</p>
<p>Many people forget things when they travel. The lost and found office of Pullman Company in New York picks up an average of 500 items in train cars each month, including jewelry worth 20,000 dollars and dentures.</p>
<p>The strangest forgetfulness occurs in horse racing. Many people throw away or tear up winning tickets. Someone bought number five, but number eight won. He threw away the ticket, but after a while, number eight was disqualified, and number five won.</p>
<p>For example, someone bought number two, but the ticket was mistakenly given to him as number three. Number three won, and he thought he had bought number two, so he tore it up.</p>
<p>At the end of the most recent horse racing season, the New York State Treasury received 200,000 dollars in unclaimed winning tickets.</p>
<p>There are also people who forget to make a will, causing many property disputes after death.</p>
<h3>Happy-Go-Lucky Flowers</h3>
<p>— Chen Shenyan</p>
<p>Chapter Six: Misfortunes Never Come Singly (44)</p>
<p>Zhu Zhai said, "You must pluck up your courage and not be concerned about Lu. You must think, if my relationship with her was very good, then it would be wrong for you to come out and provoke her, tempting her to divorce. Now that my relationship with the two of us has deteriorated to such an extent, it is for her future happiness that you are persuading her. What is wrong with that?" As he said this, he stood up and bowed deeply to Yunqing, saying, "Please have mercy and save the two of us!" Yunqing feigned anger and said, "Don't talk nonsense. I first want to ask you, what are your divorce conditions? If the conditions are good, I can observe the situation and give it a try. If the conditions are not good, I won't do this immoral thing!" Zhu Zhai said, "My conditions are as follows: First, after she divorces me, all her living expenses will still be borne by me until she gets married." Yunqing said, "If she doesn't get married, you will be responsible for providing for her for the rest of your life, is that right?" Zhu Zhai said, "Don't be anxious, I haven't finished speaking! Second, after the divorce, we must still maintain our friendship. If she has any difficulties that I should help with, I will do my best to help. Third, the divorce between the two of us will be settled privately by signing a contract between ourselves, without the need to announce it. Fourth, if she needs me to give her a lump sum of money to sever ties forever, I can also do that. Fifth, if she agrees to maintain a friendship with me, I can still go to her place to chat and have meals. Sixth, my current house and all the furniture will be given to her, excluding my clothes and all my books, etc." Yunqing listened to Zhu Zhai reciting these conditions, and felt both amused and annoyed. She asked, "Are you joking, or do you really want to divorce her? How can you propose such nonsensical conditions?" Zhu Zhai said sternly, "I think this is the best way to divorce Fengsheng. I want to oppose divorce for my family, so I don't want to announce this matter. For the sake of Fengsheng's future living problems, I will provide her with alimony and give her the house and all the furniture. To avoid hurting her, I will still maintain our friendship, and we can meet often. These conditions of mine are purely for her sake, without any selfishness. My divorce from her is not because of any hatred, but entirely for the sake of each other's future happiness. Do you understand my meaning?" Yunqing pursed her lips and said, "Don't make it sound so high-sounding. A person wouldn't casually divorce his wife unless it was a major issue!" Zhu Zhai said, "I don't deny what you said. In short, I want a divorce certificate from her to avoid committing bigamy, and I don't want to cause family disputes, so I formulated these conditions. Do you think they are appropriate? If there is anything inappropriate, it can be revised." Yunqing said, "I'm not a lawyer, so I can't talk about revising the conditions. However, you are willing to give her living expenses, give her a house, etc., so you are still somewhat moral, and you haven't completely abandoned her. If she is clear-headed and can see the future clearly, planning for her own future happiness, these conditions may not be unacceptable. However, whether her thinking is the same is unknown!" Zhu Zhai said, "Then, I rely entirely on my Buddha-like lotus tongue to guide and enlighten her ignorance!"</p>
<h3>Forgetfulness</h3>
<p>— Mao Yi</p>
<p>There was a woman who was so worried that she suffered from neurasthenia. One day, she was watching a play with her husband in a theater, when she suddenly remembered something and said:</p>
<p>"Oh, John, I just remembered that I forgot to turn off the electric iron."</p>
<p>Her husband didn't care at all and replied lightly, "Don't worry, darling. I just happened to forget to turn off the faucet in the bathtub, so water and fire counteract each other, and nothing will happen. Just watch your play!"</p>
<h3>Liu Bieqian's Achievement</h3>
<p>— Pingzhai</p>
<p>The death of Liu Bieqian is not only a loss to Hollywood, but also to the world film industry, which has lost an incomparable treasure. The world is gradually tending to equate Hollywood with low-level burlesque, which is actually very unfair. Hollywood does not lack serious people who strive for art, and Liu Bieqian is one of them.</p>
<p>Now, anyone who talks about movies, whenever mentioning the difference between movies and stage plays, the most appropriate saying is: movies bring the audience closer to the actors—because movies have close-ups, the slight trembling of the corner of an actor's mouth holding a cigarette, or the gentle fluttering of the eyelashes of an ecstatic girl, can be amplified by the power of "close-ups" so that even the most insensitive audience will not overlook them. On stage, your movements cannot but be slightly exaggerated, and the range of your body movements must be larger than usual—because if you don't, the audience sitting further back will not be able to understand the emotions you want to express. The same is true for makeup. On stage, your makeup must be very heavy and the contrast very obvious, but this is not the case in movies.</p>
<p>Therefore, it is reasonable to say that the biggest difference between stage and film is that film has close-ups. And Liu Bieqian was the first person in the film industry to use close-ups. In other words, the close-up in film was invented by Liu Bieqian. Eisenstein of the Soviet Union made further attempts, trying to expand the "close-up" further to achieve the effect of "exaggerated satire" (Caricature), but obviously his attempt failed, and we cannot imagine how much Caricature can play in tragedy.</p>
<p>Liu Bieqian deeply understood that the difference between film and drama lies in the length of the distance from the audience, so his "small movements" have achieved unprecedented success, which is the so-called "Liu Bieqian touch" (Lubltshe touch). These small movements are often impossible to perform on stage, especially for less important roles in the back stage. However, in movies, because the director has the freedom to choose the frame, even in a "medium shot" it can be expressed clearly and powerfully. Needless to say, it is even more so in close-ups. Some people call this technique "delicate", but in fact every director with artistic conscience is working "delicately"; Liu Bieqian has a "camera eye" (Camera eye), and when he sees a slight movement that can be touching, he seizes it, expands it, and emphasizes it. This is exactly like a good journalist must have a "news eye": the first element is to have the sensitivity of an artist, the second is to have the ability to think from the perspective of the audience (or reader), and the third is to be able to fully develop and yet properly restrain when discovering such a wonderful scene (the most brilliant display is also the strictest restraint).</p>
<p>Wasn't Reinhardt a master in the theater world? But his movie "A Midsummer Night's Dream" is a lavish waste, a miserable failure of overflowing talent. The crux is very simple, he almost entirely used medium shots, he is the king of the stage, he is loyal to the stage—and ignores the characteristics of film.</p>
<p>The only one who can compete with Liu Bieqian is Rene Clair of France. Perhaps I should say that this French master is even better than Liu Bieqian in handling "transition of stories"; in terms of wit and humor, the two seem similar. However, in the history of film, the one who resolutely broke away from the scope of the stage is Liu Bieqian.</p>
<h3>Advertisement</h3>
<p>— Le</p>
<p>The skills of American advertisers are certainly beyond doubt. But if we look at an advertisement in an American newspaper fifty years ago, we will have a different impression. The advertisement said: "Please buy Quanbai brand toothpaste—this toothpaste is not of higher quality than general toothpaste, and the price is not cheaper than general toothpaste. However, this toothpaste is made by my nephew. He is young and promising and knows how to make progress. If this kind of toothpaste sells well, then he may be able to get married with this profit. I hope all sectors of society will take care of him."</p>
<h3>More on Plagiarism</h3>
<p>— Leike</p>
<p>I wrote an article on "plagiarism" for this publication before. A friend who teaches saw it, and he told me two interesting things about plagiarism, which are worth recording. He teaches in a girls' middle school, so the things he remembers are all about female students.</p>
<p>Once, this teacher was grading compositions and read an extremely fluent article. The student's handwriting was very neat, which made it particularly pleasant to read. However, near the end of the article, he suddenly saw a sentence that was not only incoherent but also strangely difficult to understand:——"There is only a white slave." He thought for a long time, and he finally figured it out. It turned out to be "well-known". The girl had an older brother at a university, and she copied his coursework, because the original manuscript was too sloppy, so she misread the words.</p>
<p>There is another thing worth writing about in detail. Not only can it illustrate the copyist's willingness to make mistakes, but it can also warn plagiarists that they are bound to fall into a trap. What is recorded here is not a composition, but a history exam. In this class, there were two students sitting together, one with excellent grades and the other who liked to steal a little, often chatting in the classroom. Whenever there was an exam, she would never prepare carefully. She also had a big problem, which was that she liked to peek at the exam papers of the students next to her and copy them as they were. And the female student next to her was too embarrassed not to let her copy.</p>
<p>In this exam, one of the questions was to ask who the founder of Buddhism was. After the exam, the teacher graded the exam papers. The two students sitting together got excellent grades. They answered all the questions correctly, except for this one question, which was answered very strangely and comically——"Fallen beauty". If translated according to the transliteration, it may not be wrong, but it is ultimately inelegant. The teacher certainly understood the mystery behind it. The hardworking student could not prevent others from plagiarizing, and was unwilling to report it publicly. The teacher also did not take care of it properly in the examination hall and could not catch the thief. So she came up with this clever plan, setting a trap for the literary copyist (?) next door to stumble into. In this way, the teacher couldn't help but discover it. After discovering it, they couldn't ignore it. The teacher didn't say anything, but graded one paper with ninety-five points and the other with zero points. The student who plagiarized was also "sensible." She ate the loss silently. This attitude is much smarter than the general literary copyist who doesn't buy it.</p>
<h3>False and Fake</h3>
<p>— Lingxiaohan Pavilion</p>
<p>After the Japanese occupied North China, their first goal was the economy. The people they originally intended to establish the puppet organization were two: Zhang Daishan and Wang Shulu, both of whom had served as finance ministers and were veterans in this field. Daishan was seriously ill, and Xida (the Japanese special agent who arranged the puppets) visited him but could not meet him, so he decided to use Wang. Zhang died in Tianjin in the spring of the twenty-seventh year, at the age of sixty-three, the same age as Kemin. They were from the same hometown in Zhejiang and were also successful candidates in the imperial examination, but Wang's exam was one session earlier than Zhang's (Wang Dingyou, Zhang Renyin). He liked to squander money, and although he had held financial positions many times, he was extremely poor in his later years. His home could not even afford a stove, and he became ill from worry. Given his predicament, it is unknown whether he would have been clean if he had lived. It was fortunate that he passed away at this time, preserving his reputation.</p>
<p>Wang also liked luxury. At that time, the treasury was empty, and his rise to power was partly to clear his own debts, which officials call "taking a bath." During the five months from August to December of the twenty-sixth year, Japanese gold notes, puppet banknotes, puppet Manchurian notes, national currency (Central Bank of China notes), and Hebei Provincial Bank notes were all in circulation in the market. When the puppet "Provisional Government" was established, Wang issued the so-called "United Reserve Bank" notes, devaluing the national currency and gradually discontinuing its use. At the same time, he gradually eliminated Japanese, puppet Manchurian, and puppet Mongolian notes, making the puppet "United Reserve Bank" the only currency, with an exchange rate of "one to one" with Japanese notes. After serving as a puppet for more than two years, another old "Wang" (Yitang) succeeded him, who was purely "bowing and scraping" and had nothing to say other than bowing and smiling, and he also muddled through for more than two years. After a short transition by someone surnamed Zhu (Shen), a small "Wang" (Yintai, the son of Wang Shitong, the head of the Yuan government's secretariat) came to power for more than a year. When the Japanese invaders surrendered, the puppet regime ended, and he played the role of the "filial son" who saw it to its end. In ancient times, there was the Li family who "generationally wrote surrender memorials." Now there is the Wang family who "specializes in playing puppets," which can be said to be a contrasting pair.</p>
<p>In January of the twenty-seventh year, the puppet "Provisional Government" appeared. From the perspective of the National Government and the Chinese people, it was naturally denounced as a "puppet government." What is wonderful is that Japanese newspapers also called it China's "fake government." China called it "puppet," which is the "puppet" of "puppet," that is, the "puppet" in Luo Binwang's proclamation against Wu Zetian, "the puppet Wu clan who usurped the throne." And the "fake" that the Japanese called it is the "fake" in Han Xin's willingness to be a "fake king" when he conquered Qi, that is, the "fake" in Wang Mang's claim to be a "fake emperor." "Fake" means power, temporary. The text after "fake" is "true," and the text after "temporary" is "official." Therefore, the word "similar" does have a hint of "temporary." The Japanese still like refined language and like to use classical allusions, so they also called the "Provisional Government" that they arranged themselves "fake." And the meaning of "fake" and "puppet" is basically the same. It seems that the Japanese themselves admitted to playing puppets, which can be said to be "confessing without being beaten," which is wonderful.</p>
