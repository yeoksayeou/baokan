<h3>共匪「五月渡江」叫囂　孫連仲稱無可能　呼籲疏導青年學生心里上苦悶</h3>
<p>〔中央社南京二日電〕首都衛戍司令孫連仲，二日晨九時於其記者招待會中，呼籲新聞界協助疏導一般靑年學生心理上的苦悶和陰霾，繼即答記者問如次：</p>
<p>問，共匪揚言「五月渡江」，貴部有何防範計劃？</p>
<p>答，共匪所揚言的「五月渡江」，不過是一種在妄的叫囂，絕對無此可能，其原因：（一）竄擾大別山匪之主力，巳被我擊潰。（二）盤踞山東之匪巢，早被我摧毀。（三）江南江北零星散匪，迭經淸剿，無建立根據地之可能。基於以上原因，共匪揚言渡江，絕難得逞。縱有零星股匪偷渡，我軍事上已有嚴密部署，隨時可以消滅之。</p>
<p>問，　聞共匪陰謀於五月間，在都市製造暴亂，有無可能？　答，共匪在都市中策動學潮，工潮，企圖開關第二戰場，配合軍事叛亂，此乃其一貫陰謀技倆。本部職司京畿衛戍，保障轄區內人民之安全，如有上項情事發生，決依戡　時期危害國家緊急治罪條例嚴處。</p>
<p>問，南京學潮悉由共匪幕後操縱指使果有其事否？</p>
<p>答，今日各都市之學潮，爲共匪執行所謂「國際赤色羣運政策」之一環，最近僞「中國學聯」策動以「反饑餓」，「反迫害」，「爭取公費」，「爭取自治」作各種欺騙的號召，期其製造全國性之學潮，在南京方面，刻亦正在醞釀，現已在各學校發現「共匪戰犯調查部」傳單及爲共匪張目之反動宣傳標語漫畫等。　問·學潮如繼續擴大，貴部將採如何態度？</p>
<p>答，本人決本領袖愛護靑年之至意，事先對學生予以疏導，希望靑年學生愛護國家，　護　業，愛護自身，遵守法紀，勿爲共匪欺騙宣傳所惑，倘有執迷不悟，甘爲共呃作倀者，太部決執法以繩。</p>
<p>問，學潮與工潮，互爲呼應確否？</p>
<p>答·共匪希望工潮與學潮配合運用，達到其民變企圖，但衛戍區內工廠林立，而工人政治警覺特高，均能一本勞資協調，共謀生產之增進，達成戡亂建國之目的，故共匪雖竭盡心力，以圖工潮與學潮之配合，均難得逞，間有勞資或勞力糾紛，亦無非彼此權益之爭，一經疏導，即吿平息。</p>

<h3>不堪中共高　蒙人執戈自衛</h3>
<p>〔合眾社北平二日電〕久居因蒙之某外籍觀察家二日談稱，中國共產黨在爭取內蒙民心上，巳吿失敗，熱察綏三省人民之向背，足以左右內蒙雙方軍事之消長。蒙人「現目中共爲不共戴天之敵人」。中共之獸性暴行及過份舉措，已使內蒙人民全部離心。日寇征服東北後，曾推行狡滑之「內蒙政策」，日本政工人員，利用蒙人對中國政府之不能解決土地，經濟，自治諸問題，而大得其利。蒙人當時頗怨政府之武力「漢化」政策。日本投降後，中共發動一計劃，岡博蒙人之效忠，允許蒙人地方自治，改善經濟及重要之少數民族權利，而成立「內蒙自治聯合運動委員會」，其後易名「內蒙自治政府」，設總部於遼北之王爺廟。其後中共違信背約，言行全殊，對蒙人之風俗宗敎　蔑不屑。又大舉集體屠殺蒙人，至中共每至一地，居民已相率先期逃逸，蒙人雖無政府之鼓勵協助，仍自動執戈以抗共軍，屢次在襲，輒軍創共軍。蒙人已全部唾棄王爺廟之「紅色政權，如政府表示誠意解決蒙人問題，則彼等明日將荷戈來歸。政府如能助以武器，則蒙人崇朝之間可驅逐中共出內蒙」。</p>

<h3>洪蘭友發表感想　頌揚國大成就　對各代表民主精神尤為欽佩</h3>
<p>〔中央社南京二日電〕國大秘書長洪　友頃發表對國大之觀感如次：「大會自二月廿九日開幕以迄閉　，歷時凡一個月又四日，以此次會議任務之圓滿達成，可以預下中國民主　政府由此歩入康莊大道，蔚爲前途無限之光明。舉其大要，約有如下數點：一爲大會對當前國內局勢深切體認，爲適合因共匪作亂所引起之緊急事態，授權總統作緊急有效之處置，俾得迅速肅淸匪禍，掃除行憲之障碍。根據憲法第一百七十四條之程序，制定動員戰亂時期臨時條款，並定明此項條款至民國卅九年十二月廿五日以前召開國民大會臨時會議，再行由大會決定延長或廢止。其在國民大會臨時會以前戡亂完成，立法院並得決議要求總統宣吿臨時條款之無效，限期固暫，於憲法本質亦無影響，而又切合全國人民之企望，故此一決定實爲大會因應時需之果毅的決策。又一爲總統與副總統之選舉先後投票共歷五次，秩序井然，各代表憑自由意志之抉擇，均充分表現民主精神，樹立行憲之良好規範。此外大會所通過向政府建議之提案，凡八百餘件，內容均屬針對現實，於國防，戡亂·政治·外交·經濟·教靑·社會諸端均有切合時需之貢獻，亦充分表達入民之企望，今後政府分別採行，必著績效，而有裨於憲政。至歷次開會時　代表對於議案之討論，均極鄭重，會塲中每過意見互異爭辯熱烈時，主席一提出應根據議事規則某條之規定，即無異議而能使議案井然就理，是可見會塲中民主與守法之精神。總之此次大會出席代表達二千八百餘人，爲空前之盛會，以如此衆多之人數當繼往開來之時會，其所負歷史的使命至爲重大，乃會　進行有條不紊，大會任務圓滿達成，尤使本人於效命事務之餘，深盛慶慕者。再大會期間新聞界各位記者先生夙夜辛勤工作不倦，以正確迅速之報導傳播中外，樹立輿論，所予大會之協助甚多。至于大會事務秘書處同人黽勉從事，努力盡職，但因應配合尙未能完全府合科學之條例，疏漏缺陷，仍所難免，歴蒙大會主席團曁各位代表先生頻加慰勉，幷於主席團會議中有對秘書處同人嘉　及盛謝之決議，哈　餘，甚爲感愧」。</p>
<h3>莫德惠氏發表　出席國大感想</h3>
<p>〔中央社南京二日電〕國大代表莫德惠，頃發表出席大會之感想云：國民大會之任務圓滿完成，元首得人，國事有託，行憲之基賴以奠定，殊足欣慰。個　對於大會愧少貢獻，勉盡國民天職，約有三點可以奉吿國人：（一）參加副總統競選，純係基於表現全民擁護行憲之精神，而以事實昭吿內外，爲我整個國家邁人民主　政之徵。（二）所提臨時條款案，係依據余歴年努力國是之基本精神，始終主張促進各黨派之通力合作，，此項臨時條款之產生，實由於國民·靑年·民社三大政黨所協商，余亦參加其事，故唯有一本初衷，爲之出面提請大會討論，並獲代表同意，熟烈支持，一致通過，此案殆爲三黨在此次大會中和衷共濟之一大表現。（三）余以担任外交審查組召集人，根據多數意見之決定，提付大會通過之，敦促蘇聯履行中蘇友好條約案，影響所及，深爲各方重視，該案旨在敦促蘇聯切實踐約，傳以確保東北，安定國家，不僅有裨於中蘇友好關係之增進，抑更有助於世界和平者甚大。</p>
<h3>瀋當局疏散難民</h3>
<p>獨身壯丁使從軍</p>
<p>〔本報瀋陽二日電〕瀋市難民集中總數達三十萬人，治安吃飯都是市政的　大負担，當局將予疏散，獨身壯丁使之從軍或參加守備部隊及從事渾河水利工程。</p>
<h3>國代紛紛賦歸　連日離京者逾三百人　主席召見代表垂詢蘇北民情</h3>

<h3>正視難民的救濟問題</h3>
<p>難民問題的嚴重性日益增加，因爲人數太多，衣食收容均成問題，在今日，已非單純的市容問題，而進入到治安問題了。試觀日前發生的永錫堂强佔事件，及早成事實的潮會山莊等的編佔事件，均巳牽涉到社會的秧序；而以戰火蔓延，後至者成千累百，還是漫無止境。可知這個問題，如果零星應付，不再統盤籌劃，從速定出一個妥善的辦法來，恐怕星星之火，未始不可以　成更嚴重的後果。</p>
<p>本市於多令救濟會結束後，隨即成立了救濟委員會，羣策羣力來繼續辦理這件事情，已顯示當局對此非常重視，我們自然希望它能積極進行，趕快定出一個澈底的辦法來。上海財力較裕，向來辦理各種賑務及慈善事業，亦最爲熱心。無論官方或私人方面，對於道件最急迫的事情，諒不至稍涉輕忽，使種種惡化的跡象日益深刻。</p>
<p>不過現在的離民，除了極小部份是原有的貧民外，大多數却是從各戰區逃出來的。其中蘇北，皖北及山東來的，居其多數，而從海外各地遺送回國，陸續在本埠登岸的，亦復不少。雖說救災卹鄰，原不分甚麼略域，但要以一隅之力，來供應這些四方八面，源源而來的難胞，在房屋，設備，給養諸方面，事實上確不無心餘力細之憾。道問題旣屬全國性的，不單是地方局部之事，我們以爲除各地極力設法，予以救濟收容外，這統盤籌劃的責任，實不得不盼望中央切實地負起來。</p>
<p>不久以前，庫頁島遺回的難胞，曾由本市遺往台灣，而台灣當局未允收留，原船送回；近日又傳本市難民，將設法遣送三門灣，從事開墾，這在理論上，自極有意義。不過三門灣屬浙江轄境，當地政府是否歡迎，實施時是否　彼此配合得起來，亦尙待事實證明。我們認爲：這類事情，如果由中央來統籌規劃，指揮辦理，事實上總要便利得多。</p>
<p>現在中央財政因難，人所共知，在經費這方國，或者賽於事實，不容不加以顧慮，不過救濟經費，除列入國家預算外，中美救濟的物資，不止一筆，其數皆不算小。如五大市現在所配得美米，其配售所得的現款，原規定專作救濟用的，而行總結束以後所留存下來的剩餘款項及物資，如移充難民救濟之用，諒盟邦亦不會有異議。又救濟特捐一項，亦指定專充救濟，不准移撥他用，現在此項捐款，雖尙在發動時期，未必已有收入，但案經確定，勢在必行，預料將來的收數，亦必大有可觀。所以辦理救濟的經費一項，似並無多大困難，至少，比各地設法自籌，零皇凑集，其困難要少得多。</p>
<p>我們亦知道，中央對於此事，並非完全不管，它曾經通令各地分別收容，它並且酌撥款項，分別補助，一而又今飭邊境各縣設法攔阻，不許他們任意出境；無奈禁者自禁，來奢自來，爲數旣多，斷非各市縣就地設法所能應付。</p>
<p>中央有中央的責任，當然地方亦有地方的責任，自古道：救災如救火，火燒到眉睫上來，推諉同非辦法，點綴亦欠澈底；尤其是妨碍秩序，跡近滋擾等行動，各主管機關不容不切實防維，以保護公衆的安寗。頗聞各處難民，其內容亦殊複雜，有地方流痞，利用難胞，藉端漁利的，也有　斷救濟物品，剝削難胞，飽入私囊的。此等惡風，如果過於因循，不予以切實的糾正，則眞正難胞，反而得不到實惠，而使救濟的效率，益形减少，這却是各地方當局應盡的責任了。</p>

<h3>盤旋在高峯間　探測積石山兩日航程</h3>
<p>— 本報記者　洪絮才</p>
<p>〔本報特寫〕積石山探測機於四月十五日晨八時，自龍華機塲期程，當天下午六時抵蘭，在西北大厦住宿一夜後，原定翌日淸早六時即飛積石山探測，因爲天氣不好，延到下午一時才出發。</p>
<p>探測機自蘭州向西飛行，約經過一六三哩，歴時一小時另十分鐘後，越貴德到達共和。自共和折向西南，歷三十五分鐘，飛四十哩，臨喀拉海東面時，即已到達積石山上空了。從籣州出發經共和到積石山，沿途都是山脈地帶，但峯巒不高，且各山都呈棕褐色，山上有綠樹成蔭，和儘是一片冰雪的阿尼瑪卿山逈然不同，因當地屬黃土帶，山峯恐係紅色岩層形成。</p>
<p>探測機在積石山上空，約模盤旋半小時，但並無高峯發現。機身向西排進，半小時後抵西康邊境郭洛山，這算是當天航程中的最高峯了，經用雷達測量，測得郭洛山高二萬一千呎。因郭洛山東面上空有雲，探測機在其南面繞飛四五匝，耗時二十分鐘，又從郭洛山的南峯飛至北峯，約歷時十五分鐘。探測機因該地已沒有高峯發現的可能，就從郭洛山向東北方向直飛，四十分鐘後，再越阿尼馬卿折北，約四十五分鐘後，抵達鄂陵湖東面，在其上空飛行三匝，耗時一刻鐘，探視四周，也沒有異峯突起的現象。而針指六時，天色已晚，早巳超過預定的時間了，探測機決定即刻趕返蘭州，自鄂陵湖東直綫飛向籣州，計時一小時另三十五分鐘，到達機塲時，天已漆黑，依賴燈光，得以安全降落。</p>
<p>探測工作，原來至此已吿一段落了，第二天，央航專機準備載着記者，飛成都轉重慶返滬，但當專機於八時自蘭州起飛後，駕駛陳文寬，，因爲記得十六日赴積石山探測時，其東面因被濃雲籠罩，無法作測量工作，爲求證實起見，復決定重飛該區作再度探測。十七日的航程如下：上午八時一刻自蘭州機塲期程，沿黃河上游向西南飛行，約耗時一小時半，已飛到積石山的東側，將機身略偏南向，飛行四十五分鐘，到折半山，山高約二萬呎，並進人西康境內，三十五分鐘後，矗立的貢噶山已呈現在眼前了。因爲機身較貢噶山低，無法測量它的正確高度，據估計約在二萬四五千呎左右。這時候，專機便直飛成都，因爲陳文寬已搜遍整個積石山區，證實決沒有高峯了。</p>
<p>總計兩日航程，計耗時十一小時，飛行一千七百六十哩，速度平均每小時一百六十哩，高度約在一萬八千呎左右。第一天越積石山抵郭洛山時，機身拉昇到二萬一千呎以上，這時機中氣候爲攝氏零度以下十二度，平均溫度約維持零度以下九度左右。第二天飛抵貢噶山時，陳文寬本來打算將飛機拉高到高山之上，俾測量貢噶山的正確高度，但是因爲發現機中乘客已經有支持不住的，而沒有成功。</p>
<p>經過兩日高空飛行，探測工作正式吿個段落，但這無非是一個互大工作的開始，至於如何叩開自然寳庫的門戶，探求宇宙的神秘，那還有待於未來的努力，積石山在中國境內，我們期待自己的人，來書寫這未來世界歷史光輝燦爛的一頁！</p>

<p>〔聯合社耶路撒冷一日電〕據阿猶雙方消息，中東阿拉伯各國正規軍今日已自南北兩路開入巴勒斯坦。敘利亞，黎巴嫩與埃及之有力部隊係在拂曉通過邊境。沙地阿拉伯，外約但與伊拉克亦已命軍隊開往戰區，或完成作戰最後準備。開入聖地之敍。嫰兩國軍隊已與猶太哨兵接觸。同時據大馬色消息，敍利亞顯已出動全國軍隊半數，侵人巴勒斯坦。又悉，外約但國不已命阿拉伯六國大軍一齊開入聖地。</p>
<p>〔合衆社耶路撒冷一日電〕猶太哈迦那黨一日宣佈，猶太軍一日已擊退敍利亞及黎巴嫩正規軍之强大部隊對巴勒斯坦北部之進攻。哈迦那電台廣播稱，薩弗特附近之阿拉伯二村莊已爲猶太軍所佔領。按薩弗特在巴勒斯坦北部，距黎巴嫩及敍利亞之邊境均爲十哩。</p>
<p>〔路透社台拉維夫一日電〕耶城英軍總司令部宣布，英軍與猶太軍業已在雅法發生聯大通過分治計劃以來最大規模之接戰，當伊爾根軍於休戰期限屆滿再向雅法進攻時，英軍携裝甲車迫擊砲平射砲向猶軍進攻，擊斃猶人七十名，英方亦有六人陣亡。英軍今已開入哈迦那所佔之孟西雅區。據哈迦那總部公報稱，敍利亞·黎巴嫩之軍隊侵入巴勒斯坦後，即與猶太軍發生激戰，阿拉伯軍以大砲及坦克　護，雙方死傷均甚重大。哈迦那發言人並宣布，英驅逐艦兩艘，已抵雅法，撤退阿拉伯人，阿拉伯援軍，亦在英軍保護下開抵雅法。大馬色阿拉伯軍司令部，頃發表公報，宣布阿拉伯大砲曾砲轟耶城之猶太區，哈拉維及附近各地正激戰中，猶人被擊斃十名。</p>

<h3>聯大充滿絕望情緒　聖地將淪為戰場　猶太代表籲請制止阿軍行動</h3>
<p>〔合衆社成功湖一日電〕聯合國大會無精打釆辯論巴勒斯坦問題，已有兩週，而解決迄未在望，一般並信聯合國將袖手旁觀，且由阿猶兩方自行戰個不休。阿猶雙方在聯大政治委員會中一致抨擊美國之托管計劃。各國代表步出委員會會塲以渡週末時，大多數均感覺聖地新戰爭之瘋在程序。</p>
<p>悲觀情緒可自美代表團之正式提出托管計劃一事上看出。美國自知該計劃無通過之希望，故僅提出此計劃作參考之用，即使在三日政會重開時，亦不擬爭取決定。美某官員承認，美國曾竭盡心力，促使英法兩國遣軍參加國際軍隊，然迄今已告失敗，而倫敦巴黎亦無迴心轉意之朕兆。蘇聯及其衛星國料將在第一次試驗投票前，大舉攻擊托管計劃。</p>
<p>〔聯合社耶路撒冷二日電〕今日據悉，聖地已無希望避免淪爲猶太人與阿拉伯各國正規軍大規模作戰之塲。除非聯合國機構迅速批准一種方案代替巴勒斯坦之分治計劃，並由英美兩國毫無保留宣佈支持，否則猶阿雙方均不致過份屈服。</p>
<p>〔聯合社成功湖一日電〕猶太公會代表今夜籲請安全理事會迅速採取行動制止阿拉伯軍隊侵入巴勒斯坦。據謂安理會倘不干涉，大規模戰爭殆不可免，此舉將導致大烽火，結果不堪設想。巴勒斯坦猶太防軍決心抵抗此種新侵略，不惜一切代價。</p>

<h3>胡世澤分析　朝鮮全盤局勢</h3>
<p>〔中央社本市訊〕聯合國朝鮮委員會秘書長胡世澤博士，二日對記者宜稱：「朝鮮南部原定五月十日普選，仍將如期舉辦，不以北韓黨派會議而遭受影響」。胡氏對最近將來朝鮮局勢之演變，認爲下列二事具有重要決走作用：其一，即爲北韓黨派會議所決定之統一條件是否爲朝鮮所有黨派接受。其二，則爲未來南韓普選時投票人數究有幾何？關於第一點，胡氏謂：聯合國自極盼望朝鮮早日統一獨一，但亦決不願見其因此落入共黨之控制，故除非黨派會議之決定能爲朝鮮全部黨派所接受，當不能獲得聯合國之支持，目前美國之見解，認爲在現狀下南北韓旣屬無法統一，不如南韓先行獨立，再由南韓民選政府發動統一運動較易着手。關於第二點，渠謂南韓普選究有多少人投票，事前自難估計，但如投票人數過少，將不免引起批評，並對朝鮮局勢發生不利之影響，胡氏於本月十五日假滿，將於月中飛返聯合國任所。</p>

<p>一般物價　平靜無波欲振乏力　　上週物價，因有甚多因素，利於空方；且最具安定物價實力的美國貸款，由於負責接洽使命的貝祖詒氏已在返國途中，顯示實施即在　前，故整們市塲，除週末較露秀色外，多承前週之後，大體平靜無波，欲振無力。一般走勢，僅較少數貨品如食糖等，因受時令關係及台幣匯率調整等特殊影響，較爲堅挺，其他與前週末收市行盤相較，起伏均微。就本刋所編之批發物價總指數觀之，上週僅漲百分之一·〇九。銀根方面，上週鬆緊互見，國行交換情形，週一週五較緊，　進約在五千億左右，其餘皆　進無多，週三反差出一百四十二億。暗息頻頻下降，自週一之二角七分落至適三之二角四分，以後徘徊於二角五分左右。按一般物價，自三月份下半月起，漲風展緩，維持穩定狀態，已有相當時日，此中主要原因，本刋前已詳爲報導，茲將上週各項有關因素，試再分析如下：　　第一，最近政病歷次掛高外匯牌價，市塲物價輒追隨上升，尤以金融性商品及股票爲甚，反應靈敏，如影隨形，此次政府牌價自四月六日掛高後，截至上週末止，穩定已三週餘，市塲謠傳調整之說，屢起屢滅，致物價少一有力刺激因素。第二，戰爭區域蔓延日廣，東北岌岌可危，華北烽火正烈，即華中方面，亦難稱安定，各地交通，備受阻擾，爲此客帮去路呆滯，實銷削减，滬上存貨堆積，且有停工减產之反常現象。且際此戡亂時期，政府經濟管制，層出不窮，工商業方面，確有進退維谷之苦，於是乃形成今日經濟上之嚴重危機，即工業生產設備南遷與大量游資南流是也。反之在港粵方面，則造成物價上漲，港匯猛縮之現象。此種特徽，可由最近二週來法幣百萬元合港幣八元七八的行盤縮至七元餘見之。至遷港之工業生產設備，如以紡織業爲例，據稱已經及籌備在港開廠者不下十餘家，紗錠總數共約十九萬餘枚。第三，據民食調配委員會主委任顯羣稱，政府實施米政策，第一期試辦四個月，將於六月底屆滿，七八九三個月，適爲靑黃不接之時，設不賡續辦理配米，將招致不良後果，故經全體委員決議，仍繼較辦理配米。此項決定，對於安定米市場價格，頗具影響，而物價之波動本爲相互影響，今後米價在整個物價中，又將發生很大的作用。第四，最近物價的平穩，除前述較顯明的原因外，心理因素亦甚重要，因爲物價平穩已有相當時日，而且利空因素仍然存在，市民對於物價的預測，在心理上與過去繼續看漲不同，此種心理的表現，在股票反商品市塲上，均不無跡象可尋。股市方面，如買賣雙方，態度觀望，成交稀少。商品方面，則團貨出籠，供多求少，實銷情淡。第五，滬上物價，因上漲已達相當程度，比之外埠物價有成倒掛現象者，如刻下廣州紗布市價即較滬上為低，因此粵帮納胃至爲微弱。　　此外在上週有關物價方面的新措施可得而述者有：　　第一，國行貼放委員會於廿七日正式成立。查今年國行貸款政策前經四聯總處釐定爲國策貸款及生產事業貸款兩大項，除國策貸款案件應由四聯總處秘書處徵詢中央銀行意見後，提請理事會核定或呈報主席副主席辦理外，凡業務貸款案件，四聯總處不再直接核辦，應分別轉行中央銀行及專業行局庫核洽辦理。嗣後四聯總處復於四月九日第三六六次理事會通過中央銀行貼放委員會組織規程，規定委員會職　爲：甲·有關中央銀行貼放政策之決定事宜；乙·同業申請案件之審核事宜；丙·重貼現轉抵押利率之核定事宜；丁·其他有關貼放事宜。此次貼放會成立，國行張總裁致詞略謂「此後國行不直接放款，專事辦理對各銀行之軍貼現轉抵押，國家行局與商業銀行，完全一視全仁，放款對象爲健全而適合於國家當前需要之生產事業，從而達到各銀行經營之健全，並培養良好之商業票據，以誘導資金入於生產之途」·由此觀之，今後中央銀行，已漸走入「銀行的銀行」之階段，而際此經濟動盪時期，物價波動尤息息與貼放政策有關，扶助正當生產與引誘囤集居奇，取捨之間，每不易察覺，唯望好自爲之，試擦目以待事實的證明。第二，期待已久之短期國庫劵，國行宣佈於卅日起正式發行，暫以一個月爲期，發行折扣由國庫劵利率委員會逐日決定，卅日之折扣定爲八七·三。第三，花紗布管理委員會前爲平抑本市紗布漲風，曾自二月廿四日起，禁止紗布南運。該會認爲最近紗布市價已趣穩定，定四月廿五日起解除紗布南運禁令，並公吿週知。　　在前述狀况下，上週一般物價走勢，大致仍甚平穩。洋股頗有起色，華股市勢較爲冷靜，惟統債因華股無　路，銀行帮證劵　猛刀吸進，兼之市上又有改革幣制傳訊，漲風堅挺，詳情於本刋下節股市述之。紗布因客帮去路呆滯，本衛實銷亦淡，業中人多相　拋售，廠方存貨堆積，市　平被，如四十二支　　始終在二億三千五百萬邊緣盤旋，廿一支雙馬，亦未出一億六千萬關，龍頭細布週末行市與前週末收市頗接近。米市因民調會七八九三月之計口售糧決定繼辦，市塲人心虛軟，升降頗微，惟至週末，因民調會宣佈下期配米售價提高，刺激米價上漲，如北市塲上白粳，週末破四百萬大關，以四百一十五萬收盤。雜糧走勢亦頗狹隘。粉市先跌後回，如兵船一號粉每袋自週一之一百四十萬跌至週三以後之一百三十八萬五，週末回漲，破一百四十萬關。食糖因時令關係，實銷漸暢，兼之台幣匯率調整，台糖公司配價提高，各級台糖自十八期起每祖一律普加五十萬，市價頗露秀色。餘如化學品金屬等，漲勢甚微，建築材料反趨下跌。　　上週批發物價指數按用途分類者如次：　　類名　上週指數　較前週漲跌百分比　　食物類　四〇〇、八三九　漲　一·五三　　紡織品類　七〇〇、〇六八　漲　四·六四　　燃料類　四六七、二六二　漲　〇·六三　　金屬類　四九四、九四九　漲　一·八九　　建築材料類　六一一、九四二　跌　一二·九四　　化學品類　七六一、六四〇　漲　二·五三　　雜項類　四九一、五五三　漲　四·五一　　總指數　五二八、二二六　漲　一·〇九　　上週批發物價指數按加工程度分類者如次：類名　上週指數　較前週漲跌百分比　　（原料品類）　　食物植物產品　四〇〇、八三九　漲　一·五三　　非食物植物產品　三九五、一二一　漲　五·六九　　動物產品　三四七、一二〇　漲　一三·四四　　獲產品　四九九、三九〇　漲　二·四五　　本類總指數　四〇〇、七二九　漲　四·八六　　（製造品類）　　生產品　七一六、五四〇　跌　二·二九　　消費品　六四五、〇六〇　漲　二·八六　　本類總指數　六八二、八四一　漲　〇·〇六　　上週批發物價指數按產銷國別分類者如次：　　類名　上週指數　較前週漲跌百分比　　出口貨類　三七九、一一四　漲　五·二七　　進口貨類　五八二、四三九　漲　三·三八　　進出口貨總指數　四六九、九〇九　漲　四·三二　　國內產銷貨總指數　四四四、〇四八　漲　二·七八　　四月份批發物價指數按用途分類者如次：　　類名　四月份指數　較三月份漲跌百分比　　食物類　三七七、四〇八　漲一四·四五　　紡織品類　六四五、六九七　漲二八·六四　　燃料類　四五四、二四三　漲一二·二八　　金屬類　四六一、三三八　漲一九·七一　　建築材料類　六九五、六四四　漲二五·五一　　化學品類　七六六、二八六　漲一七·一五　　雜項類　四五二、二八八　漲二〇·九五　　總指數　五〇八、〇九〇　漲二一·一四　　四月份批發物價指數按加工程度分類者如次：　　類名　四月份指數　較三月份漲跌百分比　　（原料品類）　　食物植物產品　三七七、四〇八漲一四·四五　　非食物植物產品　三六五、一七一漲二五·四九　　動物產品　二九九、八六九漲四三·七六　　礦產品　四五八、五五三漲一七·六四　　本類總指數　三六三、二七二漲二三·一九　　（製造品類）　　生產品　七二九、二七五漲二〇·一七　　消費品　六一七、六六〇漲二四·七九　　本類總指數　六七五、五〇二漲二二·一三　　四月份批發物價指數按產銷國別分類者如次：　　類名　四月份指數　較三月份漲跌百分比　　出口貨類　三四五、五八六漲三五·二〇　　進口貨類　五四七、六四七漲二二·三六　　進出口總指數　四三五、七八三漲二八·六三　　國內產銷貨總指數　四一四、二八二漲二〇·〇三貨幣金融　　（一）銀根暗息　　上週本市銀根，大致說來，仍呈鬆弛之局。游資雖紛紛匯集本市，但一般購買力的極度低落，使購貨者多呈觀望態度，市塲頭寸，因之供浮於求，亦爲不能忽視的一主因。某金融業人士認爲「近日頭寸之濫，確係今年以來所僅見，此半固由於人心觀望物價，半亦爲通貨膨脹嚴重之確切例證」。倒是一針見血之談。　　商業行莊方面，需單者少而供源益見旺盛，於是市場暗息更趨下游，週三週四，低做至二角四分，且有低破入行莊欠息以內，僅做二角左右者。至於證券帮塲外貼息，多方自週二之廿二元跌爲週三之十九元，空方亦軋跌三元。自週二國行貼放會正式成立後，人心以爲恢復貸放在即，同業拆放更覺難做。六十號以後行莊交換結果，出數竟自週一之三千九百餘億降至週三之二百億，業內頭寸豐裕可見。週四雖有五千九百多億之差出，但以行莊存底豐厚，同業拆放仍少做開。至於現鈔籌碼，亦見十分鬆裕，週一行莊以現鈔解繳國行抵補缺單者，即有二三千億之譜，週四解現亦達千億左右。　　自週一至週四國家行局庫之差進總額高達一萬一千餘億，而扣除四天內商業銀行解交國行之定存共九千八百億之後，行局之實進亦有兩千億，但這筆進款，對市塲似未起任何作用。　　週五短期國庫券已奉令正式發行，其折扣率約合月息二角，對今後本市的銀根，可能發生若干影響。　　洋商銀行之差進額，週三以前均在千億以內，而以週二縮至三百八十四億爲甚，聞係受洋商公司提存的影響，但週四之差進額忽高達三千〇三十四億，爲前所未見。　　（二）內外匯率　　上週外匯行市基準率仍維持前週原盤，未見掛高。香港申匯則續見報縮，前週週末，十萬法幣合港幣七角八分，上週週一縮至七角四分，至週四巳縮至七角二分，香港美鈔市價亦見短，上週週一爲五元六角六分，但週四巳减至五元六角。黃金市價週一每華兩合港幣三百八十元，至週二突减至三百三十六元，週四則稍升爲三百三十七元五角。　　商業銀行之內匯行情走勢頗見平疲，穗匯匯水自上週週一减至六十元後，至週四仍維持原盤，厦匯匯水週一爲八十元，但週四巳迭降至四十元，渝匯匯水週三前均爲十元，週四增至二十元，漢匯匯水自週一至週四，穩定於十元之譜，津匯貼水週三起稍减爲每千元八十元，週二以前則爲一百元。除華北區之天津貼水减少外，其他各地匯水平疲，表示外地資金有匯集本市之趨勢。　　（三）華洋股市　　本週開始因港匯報縮及金融性物品黑市疾昇，又傳開放紗布南運，各帮齊來搜購，人心興奮，股市飛漲。華股中永紗仍以股王姿態，領導昂挺，創見二一四〇元新　價，信和亦頗堅穩，以當日最高盤七八五元收市，其他統益，火柴，中絲，永公，商務均發動攻勢，盤旋上昇，翌日發現北方游資不入股市，外匯又未變動，銀行帮見機拋售，布勢遽爲盤降，新買望而却步，多做了結交易，永紗慘退至二千元關邊，小型股中之中絲，素稱活潑，亦降至五三〇〇元收市，較前已相差四百元矣。統益獨力掙扎，盤旋在五五〇元左右。週三舊多繼續不守，盤疲淸勢，有加無已，主因由於外匯不動，物資實銷缺乏，遂致人心闌散，市况凄淸。永紗曾一度跌入二千元關，臨收賴廣帮匯票帮稍納，勉强托住在二千元外。各股一致下降，計中絲跌一百元，信和跌二十五元，統益亦跌十五元。週四銀根報鬆，且聞副總統已由李宗仁氏膺選，人心振奮，廣帮力吸，永紗高翔，曾達二一〇〇元，終以散戶能度徬徨，新買尙未見踴躍，高後見盤，復呈欲跳又止之狀。各股市價，比諸上日，大致回上。至週五市况轉入佳境，新買逐步推進，永紗創見二二一〇新高價，他股亦同時挺秀，中絲以最高價五六〇〇元收盤，火柴亦達一〇七〇元信和昇至七九〇元俱趨堅倘。　　洋股市况，更以港匯與金融性物品黑市爲轉移，週初三位一體上昇，廣帮及洋商帮頻有收吸，致喊價逐步登高，怡紗升見三二〇萬元，較上週六計漲三十萬元，英聯爲三七〇萬元買進，較升二〇萬元，會德豐爲七二〇萬元，亦升七〇萬元，啤酒七十五萬賣出，航業出入三十六萬關，鋼業七六萬買進，業廣高喊八十萬，均各上漲，約升一成左右。週二因港匯續縮，再趨堅挺，怡紗曾高三三〇萬元，旋聞華股不振，錢兌業紛紛賣出，價又回疲，怡紗回至三二一萬收市，獨吿秀色，餘均軋跌。週三外圍物價均見靜止，金融性物價亦見回小，華股平疲，外匯掛牌不動，洋股走勢遂吿盤局，除怡紗業廣而外，其他均較上日回落。週四因黑市外匯飛漲，又復創見新高價，怡紗高達三三九萬元，英聯爲三九五萬元

<p>全運大會第一聲　火炬長跑由京出發　本報採訪專車追蹤到湯山　　〔本報訊〕據本報京滬火炬接力長跑隨行採訪專瀆結消息：第七屆全運會總統訓詞火炬接力遞送長跑，二日下午三時，自首都總統府接受吳文官　鼎昌代頒之訓詞後出發，迄五時一刻跑畢。第一段行程抵達距京卅三公里之湯山鎭，較頸定時間尙平一小時有餘。第一組隊員並即於當晚返京，乘京滬車轉滬。第二組隊員則止宿湯山鎭，定三日上午五時總鐵行程。　　總統訓詞頒發典禮，係於下午二時五十分，在總統府內舉行。甫經改懸總統府楣題之前國府門前，盛况初見，萬餘民衆，均引頸摩　，翹首觀看，大門內廣塲亦爲府內職員及記者等擠滿，廣塲後大廳　下，陳一黃漆鐫花長案，上鋪橘黃絲絨　毯，陳盛開之石竹花兩盆，其前鋪白底花邊藍地氈，再前爲朱紅架之白銅火盆，獸炭與燭油共燃，赤燄熊熊。　　典禮開始前，吳文官長鼎昌自廳後長廊緩步而出，立於長案之後，長跑隊員十人，由起程跑員劉振中率領，排爲兩行，自人幾中進入大門，各人身穿運動背心，短褲，及黑橡皮球鞋，體格均極强健。彼等於禮樂聲中，走至火盆局圍，各將火炬點燃，然後由劉振中至長案前，受領總統訓詞。其餘十人，則高擎火炬，竚立其後。吳文官長首以總統訓詞頒交劉振中，並由陳局長希曾，及郝總幹事更生，協助捲好，置於備好之鐵筒中，予以妥封。繼即致簡短之詞，勉彼等此項任務馬到成功，準時將總統訓詞送達全運會。並頒强健體格，發塲大中華好男兒之尙武精神，旋禮樂又鳴，劉振中於下午三時正起步登程，由一吉普指揮車前導，突出觀禮民衆重圍，經林森路，中山路，新街口，中山東路，沿途觀者如堵，鼓掌喝采者此落彼起，直出中山門，上京湯公路，由鄭世同，張其樹，蔣聰亶，楊挺生，陳德若，蔡定邦，高光大，陳傳若，王南村，等九人依次接力，各跑三公里，於下午五時一刻跑竣第一段全程。　　〔本報南京二日電〕本報京滬火炬接力長跑隨行採訪專車，二日下午五時許，與下午三時自京出發之長跑火炬，同時抵達湯山鎭，並即將本報關於是項長跑新聞，以廣播發出。該車以沿途大雨，道路泥濘，略有損傷，當晚復來京修理，領定三日上午四時，自此間出發，趕赴湯山，與火炬同行，俾隨時隨地廣播有關新聞。　　〔本報常熟二日電〕全運京滬火炬接力長跑，定四日午後經過虞境，縣府除準備歡迎外，於二日電令所屬屆時沿途協助照料，妥爲保護。（附圖本報攝）火炬接力長跑選手自總統府出發情形火炬長跑　進入滬市區後　新路綫確定　　〔本報訊〕京滬火炬接力長跑，進入上海市區後原定之行進路綫，大會方面又有更改。屆時選手，由錫滬公路跑抵北站附近後，將沿虬江路轉入北四川路，南行折向武進路，再轉入吳淞路，然後北行至嘉興路橋後，即沿魏德邁路直趨會塲。豫魯代表抵滬　　〔本報訊〕豫省參加全運會代表及職員一行七十八人，於上月廿九日由汴出發，本月一日抵徐州，與卅日由濟南啓程過徐之魯省代表職員十九人，會師南下，昨日過京來滬，今日將正式向大會報到。河南省政府代表爲趙子傑，總領隊沙瑞辰。　　山東省代表職員共十九人，總領隊王眾韓，指導兼管理高霽軒。總管理指導苗仲元，幹事厲紹曾，女子田徑指導兼管理王靜波。　　漢口　〔本報訊〕漢口市參加全運代表團四十人，昨晨七時到達本市，寄宿於中訓團內。該團此次參加項目，有田徑·足球·籃球·網球·國術·拌角等。實力皆頗平均，足球爲平漢路局人員組成，網球選手爲漢口市銀行界人選。　　福建　〔本報訊〕福建省選手已有兩批來滬，該省田徑實力頗强，女選手隊陳碧英二百米成績爲二十八秒七，跳遠四米九十，極有希望。　　暹羅　暹羅華僑參加全運代表隊，一行三十一人，由總領隊李其雄率領，於二日下午二時，由港乘央航專機抵滬。下午四時，潮州會館特舉行茶會歡迎。該隊總領除爲李其雄，總管理翁家和。　　鎭江　〔本報鎭江二日電〕蘇省全運代表隊總領隊陳石珍，副總領隊朱守訓，及女子籃球指導萬舜祥，幹事武可桓等一行，二日下午赴滬。　　香港　〔本報訊〕第一批香港參加全運代表四十一人，由領滕潘永楷率領，於昨日下午五時三十分，乘中航公司港滬班機抵滬，下榻於大東飯店與東方飯店。第二批第二批將於明後日陸續來滬。第一批代表爲游泳選手田徑選手及排球隊員，男子游泳選手中擁有劉帝炳·尤世坤·陳震南·等好手，劉帝炳之百公尺自由式，最近練習成績爲六十五秒四，打破六十五秒七之全國紀錄。渠在此次全運中，將參加五十米，一百米，四百米，千五百米，二百米接力，八百米接力等六項。陳震南之四百公尺自由式，最近成績爲五分十七秒，千五百公尺自由式二十一分五十秒。女子游泳選手中黃婉生·黃婉貞·姊妹，（將於今日第二批抵滬），成績亦極優異，均有奪標希望。　　僑胞　〔本報訊〕菲列濱華僑參加全運第二批代表二十六人，由總領隊林珠光率領，於昨日下午三時三十五分，乘中國航空公司XTT41號滬菲班機抵滬。其中以足球隊員及田徑選手爲主，籃球名將陳金德金置昆仲則尙待第三批來滬。　　杭州　〔本報杭州二日電〕浙省參加全運選手一行七十餘人，由敎　長李超英領隊，定明日上午乘車赴滬報到。全運籌備主任　郝更生返滬　　〔中央社南京二日電〕全運會籌備主任郝更生，爲主持下午京滬長途接力跑之起點儀式，二日晨自滬快車抵京，郝氏於下車後吿記者稱：全運會之籌備工作，巳大體完成，大會可如期開幕，頸料於十日內完畢各項競賽項目，各地選手已報到者，多住於中訓團內，食宿問題亦吿順利解決，郝氏今晨快車返滬。全運期間　加開專機　　〔本報訊〕中國航空公司爲適應全運期間交通需要，自五月五日起，京滬客機每日加開三班，自早晨七點三十分開始至下午四時四十五分止，京滬間來回六次，機上並派空中小姐招待。香港游泳隊　（本報攝）衛生組全貌　　〔本報訊〕第七屆全運會開會期間，預計有選手三千名及觀衆五萬名蒞會。大會特成立衛生組，負責淸潔，清追，消毒，防疫，救護等工作。據估計，大會期間將日產垃圾五噸，已爲製備垃圾桶四十個。此外並在塲內設大便厠所三百所，小便處塲內一百四十所，及塲外二十所，供水龍頭六處共二十四個。　　現已報到之運動員，皆由衛生組代爲種痘及注射霍亂預防針，開會期間塲內外未經檢驗合格之飲料不准發售。所有檢驗員皆穿特製之黃卡其制服。　　大會衛生組共有職員七十五人，及工役一百十人，由市衛生局環境衛生處楊處長主其事，衛生經費計藥品五億，器材一億餘，其他設備二億，經常費另由大會總務組負責。昨日抵滬（上）山東隊　（中）河南隊　（下）漢口隊　（本報攝）估計藍球實力　推測奪標隊伍　　本屆全運會各項錦標形勢，當推男子籃球一項競爭最爲劇烈，抱着奪取冠軍雄心的，至少有四五個單位以上。　　從闊度來說，融和南北兩派籃球之長技的上海華聯隊，經過長時期的組織與訓練，奠定了戰後上海籃球的高度水準。菲僑羣聲隊其後突呈異彩，挾新穎的戰術，橫掃全國，華聯，征輪以及天津華勝隊都吿低頭，國內籃球界經此一次洗禮，實是得益匪淺。其後「內地」籃球隊伍，陸續來滬較量，昆渝，征輪，輜汽十六團，漸次暴露各地勁旅的實力與作風。其間華聯隊的奮發圖强，新軍「大公」的組成，羣星征馬來以一分敗於星華，顯示海外僑胞實力，未容忽視，加以海軍，警察，聯勤，印華，北平，天津，廈門，越華，等單位參加全運的籃球隊紛紛組織成軍，已呈勢均力敵之態，也有不可捉摸的强敵，而錦標祗有一個，遂形成了費人猜測的焦點。　　就深度而言，全運會經過十三年的停頓，單以籃球一項，至少有三個世代的籃球健將被「凍結」起來，（本屆籃球比賽，將可以見到十八歲和三十七歲的）選手同時出塲，今日正是他們一獻身手的好機會。新穎戰術是否可以輕易擊敗深厚的經驗？今年全運籃球的優勝，速率，氣力是否必具的條件？勝利究屬那一世代？球迷急切要知道的疑問，將得到解答。　　本屆男子籃球賽秩序已經露布，係分甲乙丙丁四組，再由各組之優勝者共四隊，採單循環比賽，決首二三四名。　　甲組之中，自以菲僑希望較濃，羣聲主將陳金德，金置兄弟，李天祥，黑白蔡金典，輔以名手李世僑等，實力依然强勁，獲得決賽權，毫無問題。　　乙組決賽權爲福建與警察所必爭，前者擁有羣聲之蔡文章，大公之黃柏齡，並以廈門晋江隊爲骨幹，後者不啻仁餘與晨友聯隊，勝負不易測斷，暹羅華僑亦列在此組，實力不得而知，近年海外華僑籃球隊水準均高，如此看來，暹羅隊亦不容輕視。　　丙組由聯勤與天津爭霸，局勢已判，香港隊複賽時可能予聯動較大威脅，但仍難以撼搖聯勤之勝利。聯勤主體爲輜汽十六隊，益以李瑞雄及爲「西南球怪」之譽的卜彥适，守堅攻銳，更覺可畏。天津隊實華勝之化身，王鴻斌，傳金聲，劉學錡，郭金銘皆爲華北籃壞名將，注入新血李漢亭，張長祿，程世春，北派正宗，大刀闊斧的作風，値得欣賞，但運用戰術，嫌拘泥陳舊，對人釘人打法不甚習慣。兩隊奪決賽權，當以聯勤希望較多。　　丁組情勢，馬華隊實力迄爲一謎，此謎可於馬華複賽對海軍時獲得解答。海軍本屆集征輪汕隊好手，鋒有于瑞章，何立德，劉景行之銳，衛有馬燦希，劉政軍之穩，堪與馬華一拚。如海軍克馬華，上海隊將輕易取勝海軍而奪得決賽權。　　由此觀之，菲僑，福建，警察，聯勤，上海，馬華，皆有晋達單循環決賽之可能。本屆男籃錦標亦將爲上述各隊所必爭。總決賽時，除警察實力較遜，馬華不易斷定以外，吾人心目中之奪標隊伍應爲菲僑，上海，福建及聯勤，而冠軍一席，呼聲自以菲僑及上海爲最高，惟前四名之爭奪，將呈空前未有之白熱化，殆可斷言。林惠中　　李瑞雄聯勤藍球·「三劍客」　西南球怪·軍校出身　今下午對恩卡斯作友誼賽　　聯勤是輜汽十六與廣東聯勤混合組成的籃球勁旅。在選拔時，兩隊淘汰其他聯勤的單位，而獲決賽權，結果廣東因中鋒古時賢受傷，上半時即吿退出，遂敗於輜汽十六。　　卜彥適，林惠中，李瑞雄在華南頗負盛名，上有「西南球怪」之稱，基本動作甚佳，熟極而流，動作活潑，因又有「卜怪」之號。中央軍校步科出身，今年三十歲。　　林惠中桂林軍校出身，經騐豐富，于瑞章在未加入征輸以前，係由林一手訓練造就。林人緣極佳，今年三十二歲，子女成行，外表溫文年靑，與「卜怪」之容貌蒼老，適得其反。李瑞雄原是華南隊舊侶，一別兩年，已經榮任中校職銜，他的反身投籃絕技，視昔更爲穩健。　　聯勤實力甚强，足與全運任何强隊一抗。前日（一日）曾與征輪隊作友誼賽，華南「三劍客」全部出堪，征輪則爲于瑞章，屠文龍，蔡忠强，劉政軍原班人馬，結果聯勤以五十七比三十六大勝。　　今日（三日）下午六時半，聯勤隊對恩卡斯在西靑作一塲友誼賽，球迷可準時往觀。卜彥適　　排球比賽秩序表（男）　　（在排球場舉行）體育場出現水潭　游泳池修補傷疤　　水電路全運會的選手宿舌，踏進走廊，就聞到一股濃烈的臭藥水味，路進選手住房，又是一股霉氣味，如不改善，選手們也許會悶得發霉。　　洗浴設備仍未解決，天天要洗澡的台灣選手，尤感不便。祗得在天暖時用冷水擦身，結果又怕感冒。體育塲襲草皮補好，正在量劃跑道，但接迎　天雨，塲子上出現了不少水潭子。　　司令台上正中，掛全運會圓徽一隻，下綴國花梅花十四朶，再下綴「第七屆全國運動會」八個紅方字煞是醒目。體育館地板已漆好，綫也快畫好了，內景煥然一新。　　游泳池的對號座業已　好黃漆號碼，小小的一方看台，竟擠上了七百六十隻位子，決算階段看客將擠得走油。　　池身洗刷工作剛巧完成，池底發現大傷痕一塊，小傷痕八塊，都已因陋就簡的彌補好了。潮州同鄉組織的「俠誼社」昨天下午到龍華機場迎接暹羅代表，開去該社所有救火車一輛，在車頭上插了暹華隊隊旗，替選手所乘的祥生公司交通軍開路，可謂別開生面。　　秩序冊今發行　　大會所編秩序册，今日可於各報攤間獲得，內容除全部比賽程序，皆排有簡明表格外，並附有淸晰銅岡十面。中距離賽跑　錦標？誰屬　宿將賈連仁的觀察　群英相會惡鬬難免　　〔本報專訪〕微雨中在海軍聯歡社遇到賈迎仁，與滬上人士睽離十三年，他蒼老得多了。六届全運時的八百公尺，他以一肩之差，壓倒了遼寗李世明，二分三秒一的成績，十餘年來始終是後進選手門企圖衝破的鵠的。現在七届全運即將揭幕，究竟誰能躍過這紀錄呢？　　據他觀察：目前八百公尺經常跑者，二分八秒至二分十秒之間的有十多個人，靑島的朱文堅，河北的馬連城，聯勤的車克英，空軍的于希渭，警察的李世明，上海的吳仲海，都是軒輊難分，沙塲相逢，常然要有一塲惡戰；不渦八年杭戰，憂患重鬣，國人的體力退步很大，中距離的嶄新榮譽，終歸誰手？或由誰創造？他表示頗難預測。　　這當中，車克英和宋文堅都是年富力强，宋今年高中尙未畢業，但八百公尺最高能跑二分五秒，四百公尺能跑五十四秒。車在練習時，據說更達到過一分五十九秒至二分〇秒七的理想成績。馬最高亦能有二分三秒至二分三秒九的紀錄。此外于李則已是四十歲以上的宿將，疆塲之上，倒也不輸後輩；有這樣一般陣容，再加上台灣中距離怪傑陳英郎，角逐時之如火如荼，自是毫無疑問了。　　道次台灣擁有短跑及中距離健將特多，幾種接力跑志在必得，有這些分數做底子，田徑錦標是有十分之八以上的把握的。至於田徑的亞軍將是上海，空軍，海軍，爭奪的目標。據買表示，海軍恃以問鼎田徑亞軍的最大資本，是劉景崐的長距離跑，王學武的標槍，吳振武的鉛球，張之淸的中欄，柯炳炎的高欄，還有四十六秒七的四百米接力。其中吳振武的鉛球，和天津齊柏林將有一塲苦鬥，吳的特長不在鉛球而在鐵練球，成績和上屆世運紀錄相差僅五公尺，據說他這次準備在塲中插入節目，表演一番。　　賈通仁參加海軍是勝利以後的事，他從柏林返國後，一直在儿十二軍和靑年軍二〇六師度着行伍生涯。抗戰中轉戰蘭封蒙城一帶歷四年之久，他常追憶上屆全運時三個並肩奔馳的好跑手：董叔昭在四川乘船失事溺斃了；淸華的羅慶隆曾在長沙曾一面暗，以後就不知下落；現在僅剩下他和李世明兩個，都已年逾面立，還在跑道上研究「一瞬間」的爭取，十三年何嘗不是瞬間？但歲月磨人，將軍老去，當年在達到終點前的歡呼與鼓掌，現在又將加諸於他們後輩的身上了。印華女藍隊長羞人答答　陳榮棠頸項間亦紫亦紅　　〔本報特寫〕出席全運之印尼華僑選手五十九人中女性約佔一小半，有二十餘人，其中除了張美姍，陳金石，及劉美英（候補）參加綱球比賽外，其餘都是女子籃球隊，此外隨行者，有醫師夫婦及看護一　　印華女選手陣容堅强，實力充沛。女籃隊長蘇王瑛，是萬隆選手代表，爪哇複決賽時的冠軍。身材嬌小，爲人沉着，歉虛，但看得出是秉性剛毅的。不尙自次，看見記者就說；「不行呀，我們沒有練習」·言下不勝羞人答答似的，眞想不到馳騁運動場中的健將，平時這樣拘謹。　　女籃隊管理員陳榮棠，高個子，組身材，黝黑，結實，呌人一見她就知道是個典型的運動能將。爲人豪爽，決不忸忸怩怩。　　陳小姐曾於第六届全運會時，得鐵餅和鐵球的錦標，並打破全國新紀錄，其成績頗不平凡。第五届全運召開時，又曾代表福建參加籃球比賽，不幸以一分之差，敗於上海，但第六届全運時，她代表上海參加，却贏得了女子籃球錦標。　　陳小姐在運動成就上，可以說是多方面的，除了鐵餅，鐵球，籃球上有卓越的表現外，曾於民國廿五年上海市第四屆全運會時，打破壘球之全國紀錄，榮膺冠軍。　　陳小姐畢業於上海東亞體專，在上海一日不離運動，可惜廿六年離開此地後，因限於環境條件而告荒蕪。她說：「因爲多年沒有練習，實在胆寒，這次來滬，原不想參加比賽的，只是同行不答應，早巳向三鐵——鐵餅，鐵球，標槍，報了名」。我們且等着佳音的傳來吧！　　此外，記者又訪問了印華張美婦女子網球隊長，她巳是任官喜夫人了，從小喜歡運動，尤其是打網球。一九四〇年，不幸因打球右臂傷筋，遵醫囑休息了近入年，這次由於各方的慫處，遂決定東山再起。來滬前曾請示醫師，證實右臂已經復原了，只是多打了仍不免徵有痛楚。　　曾起數度獲得網球冠軍的印華女選手陳金石，其勝利可操左券的。她在一九四〇年時，得爪哇網球冠軍，一九四二年，日軍蹂躪時期，亦未曾間斷，亦曾與當時之雄種人作戰，榮膺冠軍。據張小姐說：她的球藝精漢非常，發出去的球極爲有力，印尼人士，正對她寄予無限的厚望呢。　　運動家都是保東身體，講究衛生的。記者於昨午一時到揚子飯店去訪問的時候，大家都在睡午覺。她們寗可犧牲遊覽時間，使身體得到充分的休息，有了强壯的體格，才能逞雄沙塲。　　由於印尼氣候和上海的相差太多，多數都患了傷風。和她們談話的時候，記者發現其中好幾個都是鼻子塞住的。女籃隊陳榮棠已經嚐到了刮痧的味兒，她拉開了襯衫，記者看到了那粗大的頸項問，已劃上了一道道又紅又紫的花紋！　　印華代表中，很多還是第一次來到祖國。問她們對祖國的印象如何，大家都說，氣候過不慣。她們異口同聲的說：「已經到夏天了，眞想不到祖國還是那麽冷」！香港選手劉帝炳（本報攝）　　菲律賓隊總領　林珠光　　（本報攝）　　菲律賓選手第二批抵滬　（本報攝）珠羅紗帳充圍墻　運動衣褲滿屋飛　女選手宿舍的輪廓　　〔本報時寫〕女選手的生活情形，想必爲多數關心體育讀者所願意知悉的，記者昨特赴水電路全運選手宿舍作了一番巡禮，獲得了大概的輪廊，願爲讀者報道一二。　　踏進選手宿舍尙康齊，第一個印象是：潮濕，陰暗，霉氣，簡陋，雜亂，骯髒。　　本報記者（中：洪絮才）與福建網球健將周淑安及田徑選手訪談情形。（魯少飛作）　　女選手的居處，是和男選手混雜在一起的。廣東女選手住在二樓大房間裏，對面睡的是四川健兒，貼隣是福建男子排球隊，而對門呢，全是中訓國的團員。　　女選手見到記者，一致的寃言是：苦於沒有洗澡的設備。她們說：我們操練以後一身臭汗，不洗澡怎麼過得下去？一切都能忍受，這件事却吃不消　　台灣選手似乎最能遷就現實的，處處體諒大會辦事人員，該省代表隊總管理林鴻坦，一聽女選手抱怨無處洗澡，馬上就說：「小姐，已經解決了，今天起已有沐浴設備，回頭我帶你去。」　　大會對選手的招待不週，洗衣服，掃房間，都得有勞選手親自動手。宿舍內繩索縱橫，運動衣褲滿房亂飛。女選手的床邊，掛滿了花手絹，絲襯衣，和三角褲。（參看本報速寫。）　　有人說：女運動家決不是個好太太，你看她們房內亂七八糟的，那裏像個賢妻良母？孰不知凡事都不能一概而論。記者昨往訪時，就親見好幾位女選手，在決賽前夕，尙安寗地盤坐床中，繡枕花，打絨綫，縫衣服的。　　女選手中，更不乏標準的「孝女」，因爲塲內無桌，福建女選手便伏在床上作書，禀吿雙親。（見速寫）。　　思想不純正的「男士」們，看到男女選手住在一個房間中，難免不趁此打趣一番，說是「男選手的艷福不淺」。其實他們不知道這才是運動家的本色，她們坦白大方，決不矯柔造作。其中帶有珠羅紗蚊帳的，就掛起來充作臨時圍牆，未帶帳子的用大毛巾掛在床頭上也照樣可以安睡。一切以運動爲第一，對小節絕不忸忸怩怩。　　看慣了都市裏蛇樣的美女，再領略到女運動家粗綫條作風，樸素健壯，洗盡鉛華，眞覺得只有她們，才配稱得上是「新女性」的代表，也只有她們，才足以為未來的婦女界放一異彩！速寫：女選手宿舍一角。（魯少飛作）</p>

<p>科學邵理奧·居禮夫人  楊實　　—由她的為人和成就說起　　報載故居禮夫人的愛女邵理奧·居禮夫人（Mlme．lrene　Curic-Joilot）由法乘機抵美後，突遭美移民局官員逮捕，囚於愛利斯島上（Ellis　Lsland）；幸蒙美國科學家多人的援救及法國使館抗議，始獲釋放，事後夫人在舊金山發表了這樣的談話：我這次來美，係受反法西斯難民委員會的邀請，並且有巴黎美國大使館的護照；不料却遭逮捕，實令人啼笑皆非」！她又宣稱蘇聯不久將解決製造原子彈的工程問題，因之呼籲全世界科學家應研究原子能以利和平專業。她又說原子彈實在已成「全世界的禍根」了。　　這是個絕大的諷刺。美國今日之能闊步世界者除了她那驚人的財富和生產力外一，最顯着的她還有幾顆原子彈。但當一個對原子物理學有偉大供獻的核子物理學家到了美國却遭到這樣「令人啼笑皆非」的事；使我們覺得政治上的分歧和搏鬥也連累到造福人類的科學家了，並且在有優良民主傳統的美國，也有這種冒失的舉動，更令人感到幾分憂盧。　　也許是故居禮夫人的聲譽太高，反而使人不淸楚她的愛女邵理奧·居禮夫人的偉大成就；而且二十年前居禮夫人蒞美時，曾享受到朝野的歡迎，這和今日她的女兒的遭遇，適成一鮮明的對比。居禮夫人死去了，她的智慧和精神却傳授給了她的女兒。一九二四年她得到了博士學位後，就在她母親主持下的鐳學研究所作助敎，繼續研究。一九二七年，爲了效法她的母親曾獲得他的父親居禮先生的合作和鼓勵而發明了　開創放射性學說，她便和當時在研究所的居禮夫人的高足邵理奧敎授（Prof．Frederick　Joiot）結婚了。果然，她承繼了她雙親的美德，在居禮夫人講授下，他們孜孜不倦的從事放射體的研究；終於在一九三四年的　天他們試驗成功了人　放射性同位素（Artificia　radioisotopes）。這一個原子物理學上空前的大發現，經義大利核子物理學家　密（Enrico　Fermi爲美國　　原子彈的最高設計者，已人美　）的證明屬實後，便使這個新典的科學邁進了一大步。爲了酬勞邵理奧夫婦的成就，一九三五年諾貝爾化學獎金便由他們夫婦二人合得了。　　從有諾貝爾獎金以來，科學史上第一個女子獲得科學獎金的是居禮夫人，而第二個獲得獎金的女子就是她的愛女，獲得二次獎金的科學家也只有居禮夫人一人。（一九〇三年第一次夫人與柏克勒爾（Henr　Becquerel）合得物理學獎金，一九一〇年夫人獨得化學獎金）。放射性物體的研究史上兩次的大成就都屬於居禮一家，這實在是科學史上的佳話；更値得一提的都是在夫婦合作下得到收獲的。　　原子物理學發展到今天，除了產生了「世界的禍根」的原子彈外，它的偉大的能量直接用於動力上還無法實現，而眞正有益於人類的便是產生了無數的人造放射性同位素，在醫學上，化學上，生物學上以及工業上都有極大的功用。在醫療上放射性同位素的輻射綫有奇特的效用，它可以輻射到靜脈裏去或置於無味的溶液中讓病人呑食，不治之症的甲狀腺瘤便會讓放射性碘極快的醫好。　　一個生物學家曾宣稱邵理奧夫婦發現了人造放射性同位素，是比發明了顯微鏡還重要。它可以充作他們的特務去偵探一切酵素，器官，組織中的秘密。在工業上和化學分析上這些俗稱的「人造鐳」（Artificial　raDaium）更是最得力的工具。　　居禮夫人只有兩個女兒，邵理奧·居禮夫人是她的長女，次女愛文·居禮（EveCurie）一反他們家風，却對音樂發生興趣，現已爲巴黎知名的女音樂家了。一年多前上海曾演過米高梅公司的名片「居禮夫人」便是根據愛文·居禮著的一居禮夫人傳」一書，在那個轟動本市觀衆的名片中，讀者假使不健忘的話，一定記得當居禮夫婦拋棄一切去從煤礦中找鐳時，一個小女孩整天呌喊要媽媽的便是邵理奧·居禮夫人的幼時情形。　　邵理奧·居禮夫婦是巴黎法蘭西學院原子核實驗室的主持人，在這實驗室中同時還有一對中國的科學夫婦在從事核子物理研究，那便是錢三强博士和他的大人何澤超女十了。一九四六年十一月貨氏夫婦曾在邵理奧敎授指導下實驗證實了飾的新分裂方式（三部分裂）。郡理奧敎授也是法國原子能委員會的主持人，一九四六年七月比基尼原子彈試驗時，他是法方參觀團的團長。　　在原子核物理上邵理奧，居禮夫婦有這樣大的成就，但在法蘭西從納粹魔掌中解放時，他們也是盡過力的，思想的激進，使他們向左轉了，邵理奧敎授便是法國共產黨的要人之一（這也許是夫人在美遭捕的原因）；他和前年去世的郎之萬敎授（Prof.laugevin）一樣是在納粹監視下秘密加入法共的。（郎敎授於一九三一年來華，爲中國物理學會榮譽會員之一）。郡理奧·居禮天人除了科學活動外，許多國際婦女與前進團體都有她，這次去美國便是替流亡在巴黎的西斑牙共和黨在美國展開活動的。在科學上她有這樣卓越的地位，而又有崇高的理想，我們盼望由她的倡導，如她的呼籲一樣，趕快團結全世界的科學家去從事造福人類的原子能研究，而停止那競爭　造毀滅人類的原子彈。邵理奧敎授（左）與邵理奧·居禮夫人控求原子核秘密的工具  王傳義　　探求原子核構造研究的成功，可說是近代物理學的一個劃時代的貢獻，由於這偉大的研究，才揭開了物質構造單位的秘密，供給人類無限可以利用的能量，而在這研究的過程中，沒有比「中子」的發現更富有重要性的物理界偉構了，牠供給科學家一銳利的武器，藉以直搗核心。　　最初發現此神秘質點者爲在劍橋，卡間迭許實驗室中工作的查笛克（Chadwick）氏，時方西曆一九三二年。不過在他正式指出此種質點之存在前，已有德科學家培克爾（Becquel）與培合（Bethe）察得若用釙射出的Alpha質點射擊鈹時，即產生一富有極強透穿力的輻射，同時法國的邵理沃·居理（Joliof—Curie）夫婦也發現此種含有特異性質的輻射，至查笛克氏始設明此類輻射，包含一種質量與質子相似但不帶電荷的質點。此類新質點，他就名呌「中子」（Neutron），除了不久被科學家證實中子爲組成原子核之基本質點外，由於中子的不具電荷，他們便競相採用作爲一完成原子核蛻變之理想射擊體。　　中子在核子物理中日益鬣要。於是中子源護得的改良，成爲物理學家一鬣要之工作，遂有加理福尼亞大學之勞倫斯（Dawrence）發明一「迴旋加速器」（Cyclotron），以產生高能量荷電原子或核的射綫東，用此種射綫束所生的多種核反應，皆能產生「中子」。更於一九三三年，邵理沃·居理夫婦指出多種穩定之元素，可由於Alpha質點的轟擊而產生新的原子候，爲已知元素的同位元素，此種不穩定同位素的產生，漸漸使核子物理學，作一飛快的進展，次年物理學家弗米Fermi）開始以各一種元素用中子射擊以作進一步的廣泛研究。在此工作中，各重元素亦曾加以試驗，特別是原子序數爲九二的鈾，經過中子射擊後，產生一不穩定而能蛻變之同位元素，由此似乎用中子轟擊最重之已知元素，可以產生原子序數要高於九二之新元素。　　在一九三九年，弗里希Friesch）及爲脫納Meitner敎授經嚴密的檢驗及研究後，發表一重要論文，他們指出當鈾被中子轟擊時，可能產生一種特殊的核反應，即鋪核被分成大略相等的兩部，此種現象，他們稱之爲「核之對裂」，更宣稱當核對裂時，有巨大之能量釋出，此結果即由邵理沃，居理夫婦加以證實，且此消息發表時，全世界的物理學家亦俱努力加以證實，更在同年的春天，郡理沃·居理夫婦及其友人，由實驗證明當每一鈾核分裂時，可以放出三個左右的自由中子。此發現使每個物理學家感到興奮，並認爲物質中所貯大量原子能有見諸實用的可能性，他們認爲最重要的工作是使核分裂時最初釋出的一個中子，能發動鄰近鈾原子的對裂，而作一完全之鐘形反應。如此反應能果眞完成，則對裂過程中所釋出的能量便可正式加以利用了，由於科學家努力研討，這反應不久便順利的完成了，而深藏於核心之巨量「能」·廣泛地被作為現代軍事上的動力及將來工業上的動力，將今日二十世紀的人類，眞正帶人了原子時代，誰會猜想到這小小質點的發現，竟開闢了科學界的一個新紀元。鈳  友仃　　鈳（Colum　bium）是一種稀有金屬，通常因爲其光澤色彩，多用於製造錶中的「寳石」；但是現在已能利用鈳增加若干金屬的强度，以造成製造氣體輪機轉動部份或螺旋獎等。　　鈳之於若干合金，即正如維他命之於人體，它可以使許多合金增加强度，抵抗許多不良的外力，例如將鈳加入銅中，即造成一種硬金屬，可用於最新的鍜接法中作爲電極，而且極合理想；這是因爲鈳銅合余在高熱之下仍保持其硬度，而其導電性亦甚優良之故。又如使鈳和碳化合，即成爲碳化鈳，這種金屬高溫時仍特別堅硬，可用於製造刀斧工具和抽錝　鑄模。　　一九二九年美國電氣冶製公司的研究工作者，要想製出一種比一切市塲上的鋼鐵優良的全能鋼，後來就發明了一種含鉻與鎳的金屬，但是這種金屬一過到華氏八百度到一千五百度的高溫，其內部則發生一種變化，破裂成片，其原因是因為其中的鉻原子與碳原子化合成碳化鉻，形成許多小塊粒，所以减弱了鋼的强度。但是一加入鈳後，碳原子即棄去烙原子而與鈳原化結合，成爲無害的碳化鈳，因此得使鉻原子仍然担負其使鋼質强硬之任務。這就是何以含有鈳的鋼能反覆經過華氏八百度至一千五百度的高溫，而並無損壞的原因了，即算在華氏一千六百度的高溫下，亦可用鈳來增强鋼合金的强度。　　鈳的貯礦量，曾分別在北美若干地方發現，惟其量頗微，然而美國電氣冶製公司近來在尼格里阿（Nigeria）發現一富裕礦脈，不久即變成世界上最重要的鈳礦來源，因之美國至一九五〇年時，鈳碼收入量即達六十萬磅之多，該處之礦石是：一種濃度很高的礦石，其中含　化鈳百分之六十五。　　航空界現在正在設計飛入平流層的飛機，其速度達每小時二千五百啣，在這種連度下飛行，只憑空氣摩擦，即可將溫度升高至華氏一千三百度左右，因此就非借重鈳的合金鋼不可。幾項飛行紀錄  謝章濤　　近年來航空上的進展可以說是一日千里，飛行速度已到達每小時六百五十英里；而科學家們認爲今年能够進人超著速的領械，下面的幾項飛行紀錄，可以給我們一些概念　　（一）飛行連度紀錄—時速六五〇·六英里，是美海軍一大斑號」噴氣式機最近創造的。　　（二）飛行最高紀錄—五六〇四六英尺，意人歷齊（Pezz）上校，一九三八年創浩　　（三）飛翔最久紀錄—廿七天，美民航機員一九三五年創造，燃汕由他機在空中垂油管淄入接濟。　　　（四）不着陸飛行紀錄—三四五〇英里，由紐約至倫敦（商業飛機）　　（五）環球一週—七十三小時五分，美國奧登（Ocom）創造　　（六）最强馬力飛機—三萬二千匹馬力之美陸軍，八噴射機YB—49型機（即飛翼式機）　　（七）最大陸地飛機—美B—36型機，　容三十六噸炸彈。　　其餘是直昇飛機，滑翔機，和氣球的耙錄：　　直升飛機—最高速度二時速一一〇·入英里，美陸軍一九四六年所創。　　飛行距離紀錄—七〇六·三英里，同年美陸軍創造。　　高度紀錄—一九一六七英尺，美陸軍1947年創。　　滑翔機的距離紀錄是四六五·五英里，蘇聯保持的；氣球的高度紀錄爲七二三九五英尺，尙是一九三五年美國所創造的機器怎樣種稻碾米  鄭佐卿　　在東亞，稻桿在未乾以前必須用手割下，堆在一處，等待穀子變硬以後才能甩下，但是在加里福尼亞，農民都採用共乾法，穀子和稻桿能在田野同時收獲甩下。　　甩下米的穀子，雜有糠穀稻屑，在中國是靠風力颶棄的。美國景新式的方法，却是用真空管子吸掉。去掉了糠殼稻屑的穀子，必須再行碾白，以便食用，至於碾白，中國也早已應用機器，不過比較美國簡陋而已。　　但要不幸得很，一切重要的維他命，如維他命B等，都含在糠內，一經碾白，維他命便早巳碾盡無餘，而且白米因爲沒有糠殼可資保護，不久他會霉壞。最近美國的研究，是用蒸氣處理穀子，使維他命都潛人米粒中心，然後碾白，如此處理過的白米，不但保存了維他命，營養豐富，而且色澤光榮，粒粒如珠。　　當然，更値得一提的便是防止螟蝗的工作。在美國由於政府的獎勵和專家的指導，農民早巳有充足防除蟲害的知識，所以生產日進。反觀我國農民的愚痛笨苦，眞堪浩歏！（續完）自由談噴嚏奇談  雨窗　　祇要你是一個人，你就不會沒有打噴嚏的經驗，譬如鼻孔偶遇刺激，或者天氣驟然變化，或者你正値傷風—就不免「阿嚏」一聲，全身爲之一鬆。此乃極其平常之事，然而天下之大，無奇不有，打一個噴嚏有時也會變成了報紙上大標題的頭條新聞。　　你不相信嗎—好，讓我來吿訴你。美國有一個人，打噴嚏時打得着實「結滾」，在「阿嚏」一聲的一刹那，頭部猛烈向前一頓，竟然因爲用力過猛，背梁脊骨脫了骱！美國的報紙上就曾登過頭條新聞。　　還有一個很出名的「噴嚏大王」是美國浮吉尼亞州的瑪麗·瑪格蘭德·克麗亞。當她十三歲的時候，竟有一迎兩月，不分晝夜打噴嚏，夜裏在睡夢中也噴嚏不已！她的母親焦急異常，就把她送到了著名的約翰·霍布金斯醫院求診。那醫院裏的兒童心理治療科主任醫師是名醫開納博士，他把這位「噴嚏大王」仔細診斷之後，認爲這種無休無歇的打噴嚏實在與這位小姑娘的心理作用有關。他仔細地反覆盤問小瑪麗之後，才知道原來她非常不願意在她進的那所學校裏面讀書，而且她自己害怕已得肺癆病。開納醫師再三勸導，用愛克斯光照片證明她並無癆病，又保證她可以轉學到一所更好的學校裏去譯書—結果，開納醫師至誠格天，兩天之後，小瑪麗的「噴嚏病」已經霍然全愈！　　還有一個喜歡打撲克的美國人，每逢手裏拿到一副壞牌，馬上就會打噴嚏。朋友們問他是爲了什麼原因，他就說是因爲撲克牌上印花紋的那種油墨的氣味刺戟了他的鼻頭。但是他拿了好牌的時候，就居然太平無事，油墨的氣味好像也並不剌戟他了。他的朋友都覺得莫名其妙。他至今仍舊好賭如故，然而每賭必輸—別人祇看他有無噴嚏，就知道了他的手裏是否好牌。　　打噴嚏有時也頗殺風景。有一個青年，每逢和他的朱婚妻接吻的時候，總是鼻孔一陣奇癢，祗好馬上回過頭去，一手趕緊拉出手帕——大大的打上一個噴，才覺得舒服。他自己也覺得有些不好意思，就去找醫生，醫生研究了半天，才吿訴他：應當勸他的未婚妻換一種香水。原來他的「噴嚏病」竟是那位小姐的香水引起來的！　　我國的父母們當小孩子打噴嚏的時候，往往說一聲「大吉百歲」。不想此風竟然東西咸同。歐美人起先總以爲打噴嚏的時候就是上帝顯靈，所以你打噴嚏，別人便總在旁邊說：「上帝保佑你！」據說在十八世紀時，大家為了希望上帝保佑的時候多多益善，所以大家力求多打噴嚏——因之，大家就大量吸鼻烟。　　歐洲人關於打噴嚏的迷信着實不少。譬如說，小孩子在受洗禮前打噴嚏者，異日必極聰慧；新娘子在結婚時打噴嚏者，新夫妻的命恐怕就有些沖尅。在美國，即使在今天，也還流行着許多有關噴嚏的迷信：如果你和別人談話時　然打了一個噴嚏，就可以表示你說的話全部眞實可靠；出門時打噴嚏，你這一天一定非常順利；有時你安坐家中，忽然來一個噴嚏，就表示有人在你背後說你的好話。我國人每遇噴嚏，往往也會想到別人對自己的態度，有「一說二罵三牽記」之說，倒和美國人的想法頗有相似之處。寫到此地，忽覺浪費的篇幅巳多，讀者諸君一定嫌我嘮叨了，於是「三嗅而作」，「阿嚏」一聲，本文也就戛然而止。也談食油中毒  霞客里人　　最近木凟靈岩寺，有多人因食齋中毒。中毒原因，咸認齋主陳子展所購生油，或攙有雜質，携滬檢騐結果，知油中却無他毒，惟攙有桐油氣味之雜質，故認定此項集體中毒，當係生油中含有桐油所致。五月一日本刊，並有瘦竹君記昆明實事，言全家曾因食油中毒，其後知係女傭誤購菜油中攙有桐油之燈油所致。按誤食桐油後集體中毒，筆者亦曾遇一先例：猶憶民三十一春，筆者于役城固國立西北大學時，鄰校西北師範學院某敎職員小飯團，一日午餐，共食者十一人，食後均大吐。經校醫追溯中毒原因，疑及所食菜汕，或攙有雜質。因赴所由採購之商店查詢，知該店果謬以桐油攙入出售。在文壇上以「老太婆」筆名漏臉之許興凱先生，爲西大老敎授，當亦尙能憶及此事。此似亦足爲食桐汕能致中毒之參證。查禁食物攙雜，本爲地方衛生行政上之一要務，惜我國各地，足爲衛生障得因素之事太多，即在設有衛生行政機構之處，亦每忽於檢舉，未遑加意防範耳。契訶夫的幽默  旣白　　契訶夫一生幽默，直到他死了之後，你再來表現一次。他預囑在裝載靈柩的貨車車皮的，須在指定寫裝載內容的地方，孤零零的寫一個火字：「　」。　　他的理由是他常當吃生蠔。他在一封寫給歐勃　斯基醫生的信說「我沒有什麽積極的事可做，只想吃點什麽好，喝點什麽好，而我所惋惜的是，沒有可以因爲我有罪過而把我呑吃了的蠔。」　　他臨死的時候，也很幽默。他的太太吿訴他生前的好友說　　一他發着特徵的高聲，對醫生用德國話說：「我要死了。」於是他拿起高脚玻璃杯，發着奇怪的微笑說：「我好久沒有喝香檳酒了。」他安安靜靜地把香檳酒喝得一滴也不賸，然後，往左邊一翻身，不久就永遠沉默了。」弔褚慧僧先生  陶壽崧　　死別今朝足動悄，宣南還記酒三更，杏花樓外春如海，不惜宵行論甲兵。（杏花樓乃越菜館，在北平陝西巷韓家潭間，女閭薈居之所也。先生居國會，數承招飲，夜分偶行，鬯論中原形勢，作醇酒婦人示意，迨護法宣言揭布，衆始愕然。）　　世事如斯是意中，當年獨爾辨靑紅，鬣逢細拾蹉跎語，野史難旌罪與功。（全目籃君秀豪關東失敗，徜徉瀋陽，民人至故都，懊於淸流之稠，械口不談黨事，先生頻申激勉之詞，余魄無以應也。）　　抵掌燈前氣未殫，寒溫寥落舊時歡，歸耕課讀原迂見，自數晨星淚一彈。（先生長於予而氣盛於予，人生觀與予異，但始終彼此不失其風誼，屋梁落月，能不憮然！）　　莪遲憂患驅中原，處處江山似故園，坐憶平生幽疢意，恫君無病最終言。（先生箇性始終爲法律思想所支配，方正不苟，予每屬其稍稍進補藥石之品，先生輙輙言無病，憂能傷人，不自知共內奪也。悲夫！）法海洞的故事  水青　　兒童時代聽過茶館裏說書先生說「白蛇傳」，說書先生添枝加葉地說得那麼繪影繪聲，使我對白娘子和小靑抱有絕對的好感，並寄予莫大的同情。但對於法海禪師却特別憎恨，怪他多事而殘酷。　　在金山，就有這麽個法海洞，並且有一個白龍洞。法海洞在金山底西北角上，與茲壽塔是緊鄰。這洞有一間房那麼大，洞裏石壁嶙峋，中供法海金像佛龕。洞裏因不通光綫，所以非常陰暗，必須在洞裏定一定眼神，才能看得淸洞裏的一切。洞門口外，構有會明几淨的屋子兩間，可以坐下來同和尙聊天，談談俗法海與白娘子鬥法的故事。　　白龍洞在金山山下北面，又稱朝陽洞。這山石洞裏供的是兩個尺來高的白石女像，據說一個是白娘子，一個就是小靑。洞裏也很陰暗，自有和尙專在那裏候着你用洋蠟燃起來照了看，只是看過以後須掏腰包給香錢而已。——在那洞裏，還有些蜿蜓曲折的小洞，小洞裏只够容一個人底身子往裏爬，也可以點了洋蠟進去，爬到裏面三四尺深又有許多歧路，那些歧洞裏也可以爬，歧路之中，又有歧焉，據說能有幾十里路深，可是爬的人頂多只爬到丈多深就往回來了：一則怕裏面眞有妖怪毒蛇之類，一則怕耗時太多，影響遊山。因此那洞究有多深，可沒人知道　　這樣，就把法海與白娘子底故事渲染得愈加生動了。　　「法海」原是實有其人的，他就是唐代鼎鼎大名宰相裴休底兒子，山西聞喜人。裴休原是一位佛敎信徒，因此他底兒子川家並不足奇。出了家就取名「法海」；裴休還做了些文和詩送子到廬山出家。他的詩是；「含悲送子入空門，朝夕應當種善根，身眼莫隨財色染，道心須向歲寒存；看經念佛依師敎，苦志修心報四恩；他目自能成火器，人間天上獨稱尊。」又一首通：「江南江北　鴣啼，送子茫茫出虎溪，行到山窮水過處，自然得個轉身時。」法海出家，並不是剃光了頭做和尙，而是還留着髪的頭陀，因此一種爲「裴頭陀」。出家後精練形神，苦修八年，忽然大悟，就來到鎭江金山，重修金山寺。山北洞裏有蟒蛇，法海頭陀入洞坐禪念佛，蟒蛇居然走了，從此不見，這大概就是後來法海和尙與白娘子鬥法的傳說的根由。此後他又在山下江邊得到許多黃金，就用來做修寺費用，也就是金山得名之由來。寺修成後，法海也就雲遊不知所終。那山洞本名就叫裴公洞，而金山寺底和尙却利用了這個鬥法的故事，把裴公洞改名爲法海洞，還在白龍洞裏裝點了白娘子與小靑底石像，眞是極巧妙的生意眼。美國的曆本  國平　　美國曆本的第一次出現是在一千七百九十二年，到今年已有一百五十六年了。每年曆本中所頸預測的時令節氣相當準確，因此一般農夫們都很相信它，差不多每家每年都備有一本新歷本。　　今年一九四八年的曆本是由一名威塞華埃斯者（Weatherwise）所編製，今年他所推測的剛過去的三月，是給他說對了，他說：「今年三月的初頭便是「惡劣和多風」的天氣，除掉在中旬有幾天的大雨外，整個的三月將會奇寒而不愉快……」的確，整個美國的三月是奇冷，有幾處還降過很厚的雪。　　威塞華埃斯又預測今年的夏季說：「今年的夏季，農榖物將大受損傷，因爲六月中將會降雪……。」讓我們等幾個月，看他的預言是否會準確。不過如今有四百萬的曆本讀者，他們很相信這不幸的消息　　美國的曆本最初是由倍雷。湯姆斯所編著，他是麻省的一個文具商人。曆本的內容有氣候的預測，潮汎和休攸的日期，天象和星宿的演易，魚獵的規律及附有食譜等各種實用智識。　　今年一九四八版的曆本共有九十六頁，面上有許多奇特和荒謬的大標題來吸引讀者。　　原來這曆本是限於農民用的但不久因編著者的改良和增加了不少的新標題後，也使城市中的人們對它有一種新的印象及好感，因此城市的讀者也漸漸地多起來了。最近七十五年來，曆本也接受了許多外來的廣吿，頁數比原有的增加了四倍，但實際上它的眞正的材料依然和一千九百年　　一樣，並未曾加什麼新的智識。　　目前美國曆本每年的銷數驚人，僅次於聖經而已。月夜一景  吳庸　　夜間返家，一路月光師地，舉頭見屋角一彎鵝毛月，襯着淡藍色天空，二旁三兩明星，淡雲數朵，看去眞是雅淡淸麗之至。因思無垠宇宙之中，最喧囂，最惡濁，最不知享福之道的處所，大慨是要首推地球這一角了。又思可惜不會繪盡，不然頗可把這個景象描摹幾幅，贈給列強元首，掛在官邸客歷或會議室里，以代替歷代名公巨卿的台像，這樣或許可以較有益於人心人世。天才小學  必熙　　紐約亨透學院中的實驗小學，網羅了一大部份美國最聰明的小頭腦。這個小學雖然亦隷屬於紐約的公立學校制度之下，但却是全美國唯一的天才兒童學校，也許是全世界唯一的天才兒童學校。它的任務便是專門敎授及研究天賦特高的孩童。亨透小學中的四百五十個學生，其智力係數（L．Q）平均是一百五十（常人平均在一百左右），敎育家們認爲這種智力應列於「天才」的階級中。這天才學校的敎室便在亨透學院大厦的一翼，三歲到十一歲的孩子們，便在課餘時聚在這裏　一個長長的走廊中談天。　　天才學校中的學生，即使是那些最小的（三歲）孩子，已經是異乎尋當的了。普通的孩子在這種年齡時，大都是自我中心的，但是這裏的孩子們却竭力求取合作，他們在玩戯時完全成爲一個單位，並且分担對玩具兒童的餵養盥洗和着衣的工作。到六歲時，他們便討論到「光年」和「太陽時間」等題目，到儿歲時他們在敎室中講法語，而在十一歲之前畢業時，有幾個孩子還已經作成了他們自己的交響樂曲。　　亨透天才學校中的孩子們自知他們很能幹，但是他們對於自己的智力都抱着謙卑的能度，而並不因此自負。這些孩子們大多具有一種以上的癖好，使他們時時異常忙碌，午膳前後，以及回家後，他們都爲這　好忙碌。有些孩子們在研究世界大事，或者讀「政治家年鑑」，有的將他們的化學用具排列成一個小實臉室，有的研究原子物理，還有些孩子們將空餘的時間化來讀醫學或音樂的書籍，或者下棋。但是他們的興趣雖然很成熟，他們對將來的計劃却仍舊很近似一般兒童，有一個九歲的孩子希望將來成一個獵獸皮者，一個七歲的孩子希望成爲可口可樂公司的總經理。　　亨透天才學校的敎授法獲得了極大的成功，因此這學校中的申請入學書源源不絕。這學期已有二千個申請入學的孩子，天才學校將桃選出八十五個智力最高的孩子，成爲這學校中的學生。星語集  菰凝　　把自己的秘密吿訴他人而請他保守秘密，是世界上最荒譯的事。你旣然自己不能保守秘密，他爲什麽有義務要替你保守你那己不能稱爲秘密的秘密。　　失信是最壞的事，你給了他一個希望却又讓他失望，這種惆悵遠比你不答應他時他的惆悵深得多。這是罪惡，因爲你浪費了他人的等待。「失敗」年譜  無咎　　無論什麽人的一生中，總不免要遭遇到一點不如意的事情，最要緊的是：你愈處在逆境，就愈需要有勇氣，若能堅苦卓絕，結果必然成功。　　請看看這一位美國人的紀錄：　　一八三一年—經營商業失敗。　　一八三二年—競選省參議員，失敗。　　一八三三年—經營商業，又吿失敗。　　一八三四年—競選省參議員，成功。　　一八三五年—愛人去世。　　一八三六年—極度神經衰弱。　　一八三八年—競選省央議會議長，失敗。　　一八四三年—競選全省地政委員，失敗。　　一八四三年—競選衆議員，失敗。　　一八四六—競選衆議員，成功。　　一八四八年—衆議員任期届滿，再度競選，希望能夠連任，結果：失敗。　　一八五五年—競選參議員，失敗。　　一八五六年—競選副總統，失敗。　　一八五八年—競選參議員，又失敗。　　一八六〇年—競選總統，成功。　　這個人是誰呢？他是一個從未進過學校的鄉下孩子，但是他不願長此埋沒了自己。他無力上學，便決意刻苦自修。他一生坎坷，但是他不願就此屈服，他不願自認失敗。在一切環境都好像已經絕望的時候，他不願引退，不願逃避。他深信一個人應當簡單樸素，忠誠對人，勤勞堅忍，中正和平；他自己便一生遵守這些原則。終於在千錘百練之後，有志竟成。　　他是誰呢？—他的名字是：林肯。清雷雪圖苓　　張溥翁（繼）仙逝後，數月來其夫人爲之訪求墓地於北平之西山一帶，聞近在香山勘得盆地一區，風景旣美，形勢亦佳，巳擇日興工，一代元老即將長眠於此。傅老是滄縣人，生前好游香山，每於瞻　碧雲寺後，徘徊山畔，早有「是處靑山好理骨」之預言，家屬自當從其遺志。兩月前，拙稿記洛陽北邙山並及北平西山，萬流營葬，異地同風，南籍之段祺瑞梁啓超等尙且不願首邱故里，何况溥老河北人，而北平亦河北地乎？　　平西諸山，不一其名，蜿蜓起伏，直接太行山脈，泛稱西山一帶。香山又在萬壽山（頤和國）玉泉山以西二三十里之遙。又有「萬花山」者，更小巧而美麗，有「萬花仙女廟」，土人相傳一神話：當年一幼女，生而靈敏，有畏徵，九歲而殤，復顯化身，原是仙女下凡走一遭。於是村媼鄉耆爲之立廟，香火不絕，靈驗非常。民國十八年，馮武越王小隱在津主辦之北洋賽報，又登出「畹華」與「萬花」之佳話，更大妙無疆。據說梅畹華曾游覽至此，其同行之友見廟中萬花神女之塑像與畹華台上之扮相有同一之美姿，而「萬花」與「畹華」又是同音，（雖「花」「華」二字分陰陽平，「畹」「萬」二字分上去聲，而差別極微，若有用西式拼香Wan　Hua，更完全一致。）於是衆皆歡喜讀嘆曰二「萬花」其「畹華」之前身乎？神女必名角之靈魂也。經名士之慫恿，博士之許可，即於山下，選購佳城，圈以漢玉色之石欄，樹以朱字楷書精刻「綴玉軒塋」之界碣，爲大王之「萬年吉地」。二十年來，此「大王之陵墓」已否建造完工，則不可知，因當年馮王二友寄我之照片及記事之段落，止於此也。另一照片則山峯上有極大之「梅」字，畹華與名士輩立於其下。予即隨筆寫四句於片上：「萬花山裏畹華墳，嶽嶽亭亭倚夕曛，記取他年憑弔處，好從黃土憶靑雲。」光陰如箭，馮王二友皆已古人，畹華的名業仍是隆隆鼎鼎，叫座能力，恍如「萬花競發，萬紫千紅。」北方人士殷盼其來，有問我者，我說老朽與之雖曾談藝研藝，對一般名伶之行止云云則向不過間。但以此事測驗，旣已親選「王陵」，遲早必以北平為歸宿，而今又有元老張公之英靈，為將來之神侶，則其不能不北歸也，更無疑義。諸君且少安毋躁，靜候可也。</p>

<p>[Our Jinan Dispatch, 2nd] A large-scale annihilation battle is fiercely unfolding in the Yidu-Linzi area of central Shandong. After the main force of the bandit 7th Column was surrounded by the National Army, the bandit 9th Column and part of the 13th Column, originally fleeing north from Weixian, attempted a counter-encirclement out of fear that the 7th Column would be wiped out by our forces.

<h3>Price Stabilization Plan to be Implemented Gradually with the Use of US Aid, Bei Zuyi Returns to Shanghai and Decides to Go to Nanjing Again</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 2nd] Bei Zuyi continued to visit relevant leaders in Nanjing on the 2nd. In the morning, he paid respects to Zhang Qun and Finance Minister Yu Hongjun one after another, and was hosted at a luncheon by Yu.

He returned to Shanghai by night train at 11 PM on the 2nd, where he will organize various data obtained in the United States and prepare a written report, after which he will come to Nanjing again in about two or three days. Regarding the issue of the organization for using US aid, the United States hopes that we can set up a special agency to handle it. The Executive Yuan previously intended not to set up a separate agency, so it is still under consideration. Even if a new agency is established, it may have to wait until the new Executive Yuan is formed.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 2nd] Bei Zuyi and Zhang Jia'ao jointly paid respects to Chairman Chiang and President Zhang, Minister Yu Hongjun, and others.

<h3>Perrin Arrives in Nanjing from Shanghai</h3>
<p>Inspects the Status of Child Welfare</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 2nd] Dr. Perrin, former Surgeon General of the United States Public Health Service, arrived in Nanjing this morning after arriving in Shanghai the day before yesterday.

<h3>Communist Bandits Clamor for a "May Crossing of the Yangtze," Sun Lianzhong Says it's Impossible, Calls for Guiding the Mental Distress of Young Students</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 2nd] Sun Lianzhong, Commander of the Capital Garrison, called on the press to help guide the mental distress and gloom of the general youth and students at his press conference at 9:00 AM on the 2nd, and then answered questions from reporters as follows:</p>
<p>Question: The communist bandits have declared a "May Crossing of the Yangtze," what defense plans does your department have?</p>
<p>Answer: The "May Crossing of the Yangtze" declared by the communist bandits is nothing more than a wild clamor, and is absolutely impossible, for the following reasons: (1) The main force of the bandits disturbing the Dabie Mountains has been defeated by us. (2) The bandit nests entrenched in Shandong have long been destroyed by us. (3) Scattered bandits in Jiangnan and Jiangbei have been suppressed repeatedly, and there is no possibility of establishing a base. Based on the above reasons, the communist bandits' claim to cross the Yangtze is absolutely impossible to succeed. Even if there are sporadic bandit groups who sneak across, our military has made strict deployments and can eliminate them at any time.</p>
<p>Question: It is heard that the communist bandits are plotting to create riots in the cities in May, is it possible? Answer: The communist bandits are inciting student movements and labor unrest in the cities, attempting to open a second battlefield to coordinate with military rebellion. This is their consistent conspiracy and trick. This headquarters is responsible for guarding the capital area and ensuring the safety of the people within its jurisdiction. If the above occurs, we will strictly punish them in accordance with the Emergency Criminal Law for Endangering the State During the Suppression of Rebellion Period.</p>
<p>Question: Are student movements in Nanjing actually manipulated and directed by communist bandits behind the scenes?</p>
<p>Answer: The student movements in various cities today are part of the communist bandits' implementation of the so-called "International Red Group Movement Policy." Recently, the pseudo "All-China Student Federation" has incited various deceptive slogans such as "anti-hunger," "anti-persecution," "striving for public funding," and "striving for autonomy," hoping to create a nationwide student movement. In Nanjing, it is also being brewed. Handouts from the "Communist Bandit War Criminal Investigation Department" and reactionary propaganda slogans and cartoons that speak up for the communist bandits have now been discovered in various schools. Question: If the student movement continues to expand, what attitude will your department take?</p>
<p>Answer: I am determined to follow the Leader's utmost care for youth, and will guide the students in advance, hoping that the young students will love the country, protect their studies, love themselves, abide by the law, and not be deceived by communist propaganda. If there are those who are obsessed and willing to work for the communist bandits, this department will enforce the law.</p>
<p>Question: Is it true that student movements and labor unrest echo each other?</p>
<p>Answer: The communist bandits hope that labor unrest and student movements will cooperate to achieve their attempt at civil unrest, but there are many factories in the garrison area, and the workers' political awareness is particularly high. They can all coordinate labor and management to jointly promote increased production and achieve the goal of suppressing the rebellion and building the country. Therefore, although the communist bandits have exhausted their efforts to coordinate labor unrest with student movements, they have been unable to succeed. Occasional labor-management or labor disputes are nothing more than disputes over each other's rights and interests, and they are settled once they are guided.</p>
<p>[Our Xinyang Dispatch, 2nd] After being severely attacked by the National Army, the bandits who infiltrated the empty city of Runan are now in a static state. It is judged that the bandit invasion of Runan is obviously to contain the National Army from reinforcing the west.</p>
<h3>Military Progress in Southern Guangdong, Defections of Newly Recruited Traitor Bandits Increase Daily</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Guangzhou, 2nd] The Guangdong-Jiangxi-Hunan Border Area Suppression Headquarters has sent rural cleansing teams to work in various townships in Nanxiong. To date, 2,416 communist bandits have awakened and surrendered to various teams. Also, the military suppression of bandits in southern Guangdong has made repeated progress.

<h3>Bandit Strongholds Along the Jianhe River in Southern Tianjin are Still Being Attacked</h3>
<p>[Our Tianjin Dispatch, 2nd] On the evening of the 1st, over 2,000 bandits from the 20th and 21st Regiments of the Bohai Military Region attacked various strongholds along the southern bank of the Jianhe River in southern Tianjin. They were gradually repelled by the National Army at dawn on the 2nd.</p>
<h3>Unable to Endure High-handed Rule by Chinese Communists, Mongolians Take Up Arms to Defend Themselves</h3>
<p>[United Press, Beiping, 2nd] A foreign observer who has lived in Inner Mongolia for a long time said on the 2nd that the Chinese Communist Party has failed to win the hearts and minds of the people of Inner Mongolia, and that the support of the people in the three provinces of Rehe, Chahar, and Suiyuan is enough to sway the military balance of power between the two sides in Inner Mongolia. Mongolians "now regard the Chinese Communist Party as an irreconcilable enemy." The communist bandits' bestial atrocities and excessive measures have alienated all the people of Inner Mongolia. After conquering the Northeast, the Japanese invaders implemented a cunning "Inner Mongolia Policy." Japanese political workers took advantage of the Mongolians' inability to resolve the issues of land, economy, and autonomy with the Chinese government and gained great benefits. At that time, the Mongolians quite resented the government's forceful "Sinicization" policy. After the Japanese surrender, the Chinese Communist Party launched a plan to win over the Mongolians' loyalty, allowing the Mongolians local autonomy, improving the economy, and important minority rights, and established the "Inner Mongolia Autonomous United Movement Committee," later renamed the "Inner Mongolia Autonomous Government," with its headquarters in Wangyemiao, Liaobei. Later, the Chinese Communist Party broke its promises, its words and deeds were completely different, and it despised the Mongolians' customs and religions. It also carried out large-scale collective massacres of Mongolians. Whenever the Chinese Communist Party arrived in a place, the residents had already fled in advance. Although the Mongolians had no government encouragement or assistance, they still automatically took up arms to resist the communist army, and repeatedly attacked and inflicted heavy casualties on the communist army. The Mongolians have all abandoned the "Red Regime" of Wangyemiao. If the government expresses sincerity in resolving the Mongolian issue, they will return tomorrow with weapons in hand. If the government can help them with weapons, the Mongolians can drive the Chinese Communist Party out of Inner Mongolia within a day.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Economic Affairs Renamed Ministry of Industry and Commerce, Functions Still Under Study</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 2nd] According to the Executive Yuan Organization Law promulgated in accordance with the Constitution, the Ministry of Economic Affairs has been renamed the Ministry of Industry and Commerce. It is learned that because the Ministry of Economic Affairs is at the beginning of constitutional governance and will change its name, it has drafted an Organization Law of the Ministry of Industry and Commerce and sent it to the Executive Yuan for transfer to the National Government and submission to the Legislative Yuan to complete the legislative process. However, the content of the organization law has not been changed. In the entire draft, only the words "economic affairs" have been changed to "industry and commerce." The ministry still has seven departments, including control and industry. However, it remains to be studied whether the functions of the Ministry of Industry and Commerce stipulated in the Executive Yuan Organization Law in the Constitution are the same as the current functions of the Ministry of Economic Affairs.</p>
<h3>People of the Capital Line Up to Visit the National Assembly Hall</h3>

<h3>Hong Lanyou Expresses His Feelings, Praises the Achievements of the National Assembly, and Especially Admits the Democratic Spirit of the Representatives</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 2nd] Hong Lanyou, Secretary-General of the National Assembly, recently published his views on the National Assembly as follows: "The conference lasted for one month and four days from the opening on February 29 to the closing. With the successful completion of the mission of this conference, it can be foreseen that China's democratic government will enter a broad road and become a bright future with unlimited prospects. There are roughly the following points: First, the conference deeply recognized the current domestic situation. In order to adapt to the emergency situation caused by the communist bandits' rebellion, the President was authorized to make emergency and effective arrangements in order to quickly eliminate the bandit disaster and remove obstacles to constitutional governance. According to the procedures of Article 174 of the Constitution, temporary provisions were formulated during the period of mobilization and war, and it was specified that these provisions would be decided by the National Assembly at a temporary meeting convened before December 25, 1950, for further extension or abolition. Before the completion of the suppression of the rebellion before the temporary meeting of the National Assembly, the Legislative Yuan may also resolve to request the President to declare the temporary provisions invalid. The temporary limit has no impact on the essence of the Constitution, but it also meets the expectations of the people across the country, so this decision is the resolute decision of the Assembly in response to the needs of the times. Another is that the election of the President and Vice President was voted successively for a total of five times. The order was orderly, and the choices made by each representative based on free will fully demonstrated the democratic spirit and established a good model for constitutional governance. In addition, the Assembly passed more than 800 proposals to the government, the content of which is aimed at reality, and all have contributions that meet the needs of the times in terms of national defense, suppression of rebellion, politics, diplomacy, economy, education, youth, and society. It also fully expresses the people's expectations. In the future, the government will adopt them separately, and they will definitely achieve results and benefit constitutional governance. As for the discussions of representatives on the proposals during each meeting, they are extremely serious. Whenever opinions differ and debates are heated in the meeting, the chairman proposes that the provisions of a certain article of the rules of procedure should be followed, that is, there is no objection and the proposals can be handled in an orderly manner. It can be seen that the spirit of democracy and law-abiding in the meeting. In short, this conference had more than 2,800 representatives attending, which was an unprecedented grand meeting. With such a large number of people meeting at a time of carrying on the past and opening up the future, the historical mission it bears is extremely important, but the meeting proceeded in an orderly manner and the mission of the Assembly was successfully completed, especially making me deeply admired in addition to serving the affairs. During the conference, the gentlemen reporters of the press worked tirelessly day and night, spreading accurate and rapid reports at home and abroad, establishing public opinion, and providing a lot of assistance to the conference. As for the colleagues of the Secretariat of the Assembly, they worked diligently and tried their best, but because the response and coordination were still unable to fully comply with scientific regulations, omissions and defects were still unavoidable. I have been frequently comforted by the Presidium of the Assembly and the representatives, and there is a resolution of praise and gratitude to the colleagues of the Secretariat in the Presidium meeting. I am very grateful."</p>
<h3>Mo Dehui Expresses His Feelings About Attending the National Assembly</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 2nd] Mo Dehui, a representative of the National Assembly, recently published his feelings about attending the Assembly, saying: The mission of the National Assembly has been successfully completed, the head of state has been obtained, national affairs have been entrusted, and the foundation for constitutional governance has been laid, which is very gratifying. Personally, I have made few contributions to the Assembly, and I have tried my best to fulfill my national duty. There are about three points that I can tell the people of the country: (1) Participating in the election of the Vice President is purely based on expressing the spirit of the whole people supporting constitutional governance, and announcing the facts at home and abroad that our entire country is moving towards democracy. (2) The temporary provisions I proposed are based on the basic spirit of my years of efforts in national affairs, and I have always advocated promoting the cooperation of all parties. The emergence of these temporary provisions is actually due to the consultation of the three major parties of the Kuomintang, the Youth Party, and the Democratic Socialist Party. I also participated in it, so I have only made my original intention to come forward to ask the Assembly to discuss it, and it was approved by the representatives with warm support and unanimous passage. This case is almost a major manifestation of the harmony and cooperation of the three parties in this Assembly. (3) As the convener of the Foreign Affairs Review Group, I submitted to the Assembly for approval, based on the decision of the majority, a proposal urging the Soviet Union to fulfill the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship and Alliance. Its impact has been deeply valued by all parties. The purpose of this case is to urge the Soviet Union to earnestly fulfill its treaty, in order to ensure the Northeast and stabilize the country. It not only benefits the improvement of Sino-Soviet friendly relations, but also greatly contributes to world peace.</p>

<h3>National Representatives Leave One After Another, More Than 300 People Leaving Nanjing in Recent Days, Chairman Summons Representatives to Inquire About the People's Situation in Northern Jiangsu</h3>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Addressing the Relief Problem of Refugees</h3>
<p>The severity of the refugee problem is increasing day by day, because the number of people is too large, and the provision of food, clothing, and shelter has become a problem. Today, it is no longer just a matter of urban appearance, but has entered the realm of public security. Looking at the Yongxitang illegal occupation incident that occurred a few days ago, and the early occupation incidents of the Chaohuai Mountain Villa, etc., all of which have involved social order; and with the spread of the flames of war, the number of those arriving later is in the thousands, still endless. It can be seen that if this problem is dealt with piecemeal, without unified planning, and a proper solution is determined as soon as possible, I am afraid that a single spark can ignite a more serious consequence.</p>
<p>After the dissolution of the Shanghai Multiple Relief Association, the Relief Committee was immediately established to continue handling this matter with the concerted efforts of everyone, which shows that the authorities attach great importance to this. We naturally hope that it can actively proceed and quickly determine a thorough solution. Shanghai has relatively abundant financial resources and has always been most enthusiastic in handling various disaster relief and charitable undertakings. Regardless of the official or private sector, for the most urgent matters, it is expected that they will not be slightly negligent, so that the signs of various deteriorations will become increasingly profound.</p>
<p>However, the current refugees, except for a very small number who are original paupers, are mostly those who have fled from various war zones. Among them, those from northern Jiangsu, northern Anhui, and Shandong account for the majority, and there are also many who have been sent back from overseas and have landed in this port one after another. Although it is said that disaster relief and aiding neighbors does not distinguish between regions, it is true that there is a regret of insufficient strength to supply these refugees from all directions, who are arriving in a continuous stream, in terms of housing, facilities, and supplies. Since the problem is national, not just a local matter, we believe that in addition to the best efforts of various places to provide relief and shelter, the responsibility for this overall planning must be shouldered by the central government.</p>
<p>Not long ago, refugees returned from Sakhalin were sent by this city to Taiwan, but the Taiwan authorities refused to take them in and sent them back on the original ship. Recently, it has been reported that refugees in this city will be sent to Sanmen Bay to engage in reclamation, which is of great significance in theory. However, Sanmen Bay is under the jurisdiction of Zhejiang, and whether the local government welcomes it and whether the implementation can be mutually coordinated remain to be proven by facts. We believe that if these kinds of things are planned and managed by the central government, it will be much more convenient in fact.</p>
<p>It is common knowledge that the central government is currently experiencing financial difficulties, and in the aspect of funding, or due to reality, it is impossible not to take it into consideration. However, in addition to including relief funds in the national budget, the materials for Sino-American relief are more than a single amount, and the numbers are not small. For example, the American rice currently allocated to the five major cities, the cash obtained from its sale, was originally stipulated to be used exclusively for relief, and the surplus funds and materials left over after the end of the Executive Yuan, if transferred for refugee relief, it is expected that the Allied countries will not object. In addition, the relief special donation item is also designated to be used exclusively for relief and is not allowed to be transferred for other purposes. Although this donation is still in the initial stage of mobilization and may not have been received yet, the plan has been determined and is bound to be implemented, and it is expected that the future receipts will be considerable. Therefore, the funding item for relief work does not seem to be too difficult. At the very least, it is much less difficult than each place trying to raise funds on its own, collecting them piecemeal.</p>
<p>We also know that the central government is not completely ignoring this matter. It has issued orders to various places to provide shelter separately, and it has also allocated funds to provide subsidies separately. It has repeatedly ordered the border counties to find ways to block them, not allowing them to leave the country arbitrarily; unfortunately, those who are forbidden are forbidden, and those who come continue to come. The number is too large, and it is not something that each city and county can cope with by finding ways locally.</p>
<p>The central government has its central responsibility, and of course, the local government also has its local responsibility. It has been said since ancient times that disaster relief is like fighting a fire. When the fire burns to your eyebrows, shirking responsibility is not the way, and embellishment is not thorough; especially for actions that hinder order and are close to causing trouble, the responsible authorities must earnestly prevent and maintain them to protect the public's peace. It has been heard that the content of refugees in various places is also quite complex. There are local ruffians who use refugees to seek profit, and there are also those who intercept relief items, exploit refugees, and fill their own pockets. If these bad habits are overly tolerated and not earnestly corrected, then the real refugees will not receive actual benefits, and the efficiency of relief will be further reduced, which is the responsibility of the local authorities.</p>
<p>The Chairman Personally Reviews the Presidential Election Certificate (Taken at the Lishi Society)</p>
<h3>The Ministry of Finance has already planned for the operating expenses of agencies for the second half of the year. The nine proposed measures have been approved by the Executive Yuan.</h3>
<p>[Our newspaper, Nanjing, 2nd] The national budget for the second half of the 37th year has not yet been drafted by the competent authority. However, operating expenses urgently need to be planned in advance, and in order to prepare for the treasury appropriation procedures as soon as possible, the Ministry of Finance has recently referred to the precedent of the first half of this year. Before the general budget for the second half of the 37th year is approved and implemented, for the raising of various operating expenses, nine measures have been proposed and have been approved by the Executive Yuan. The main points are as follows: (1) Military expenses will still be pre-allocated one month in advance as usual. (2) Ordinary operating expenses of central agencies will be allocated based on the average of one-sixth of the original budget and additional budget extensions for the first half of the 37th year. For agencies that apply direct allocation of funds, two months will be allocated first, but in remote areas where the monthly expense amount is small, three months may be allocated first. Agencies that apply for fund allocation will pre-allocate three months uniformly. (3) Living subsidies and food rice allowances for central agencies (including business agencies) will be temporarily advanced according to the original agency units and the actual allocation amount in May of the first half of this year. Although there are agencies that apply for direct allocation or allocation of funds, the pre-allocation months and pre-allocation funds are the same, and all are allocated into the treasury account at one time. The receiving agency shall, in accordance with the actual number of people and approved standards, lawfully and realistically withdraw funds from the treasury. (4) Provincial and municipal subsidies will be estimated based on the sum of the original approved budget for the first half of the year and the adjusted and added non-staple food expenses, security officer and soldier salaries, and employee living subsidies. The total amount will be divided by six, and three months will be pre-allocated. This will be deducted after the provincial and municipal subsidies are approved. (5) Main and subsidiary food expenses for public-funded students and accommodated persons will be pre-allocated by the Ministry of Finance for three months based on the sum of the original budget and the additional budget for May. (6) Newly established agencies and staff members will be ordered by the Executive Yuan to be realistically advanced and allocated by the Ministry of Finance, and deducted after the budget is established. (7) The principal and interest of various debts due will be advanced by the Ministry of Finance and deducted after the budget is approved.</p>

According to Chen, this is the third time that China has organized a team to observe a solar eclipse. Chen also participated in the previous two times (the 25th and 30th years), both of which encountered sunny weather and achieved satisfactory results. Because this is an annular eclipse, there are fewer observable items, so the instruments brought are not as many as in the previous two times.</p>

The petition on the 2nd especially emphasized the circulation voucher issue, and raised three demands: (1) The ratio of circulation vouchers to legal tender was previously set at one to ten, which was too disadvantageous to the people. It should be changed to one to eleven yuan and five jiao. (2) Legal tender should be freely circulated in the Northeast. (3) The issuance of circulation vouchers should be stopped.

<h3>Hovering Among the Peaks: A Two-Day Flight to Survey Mount 積石</h3>
<p>— By our reporter Hong Xucai</p>
<p>[This newspaper's special feature] The Mount 積石 survey plane took off from Longhua Airport at 8:00 AM on April 15th, arriving in Lanzhou at 6:00 PM that day. After staying overnight at the Northwest Mansion, it was originally scheduled to fly to Mount 積石 for survey at 6:00 AM the next morning, but due to bad weather, the departure was delayed until 1:00 PM.</p>
<p>The survey plane flew west from Lanzhou, passing about 163 miles in 1 hour and 10 minutes, crossing Guide and arriving at Gonghe. From Gonghe, it turned southwest, flying 40 miles in 35 minutes. Approaching the east side of Lake喀拉海, it reached the airspace above Mount 積石. The route from Lanzhou through Gonghe to Mount 積石 was all mountainous, but the peaks were not high, and the mountains were mostly brown, with green trees, very different from the snow-covered Mount 阿尼瑪卿. As the area belongs to the loess region, the mountain peaks are likely formed of red rock layers.</p>
<p>The survey plane circled above Mount 積石 for about half an hour, but no high peaks were found. The plane proceeded west, and after half an hour, reached Mount 郭洛 on the border of Xikang. This was the highest peak of the day's journey. Radar measurements showed Mount 郭洛 to be 21,000 feet high. Because there were clouds over the east side of Mount 郭洛, the survey plane circled its south side four or five times, taking 20 minutes. It then flew from the south peak to the north peak of Mount 郭洛, taking about 15 minutes. Since there was no possibility of finding higher peaks in the area, the survey plane flew northeast from Mount 郭洛, and after 40 minutes, crossed Mount 阿尼瑪卿 again, turning north. After about 45 minutes, it reached the east side of Lake 鄂陵, flying three circles over it, taking 15 minutes, and observing the surroundings, but no unusual peaks were seen. The clock pointed to 6:00 PM, the sky was getting dark, and it was already past the scheduled time. The survey plane decided to return to Lanzhou immediately, flying directly from the east of Lake 鄂陵 to Lanzhou, taking 1 hour and 35 minutes. When it arrived at the airport, it was already dark, and it relied on lights to land safely.</p>
<p>The survey work had come to an end at this point. The next day, a China National Aviation Corporation (CNAC) special plane was prepared to carry reporters to Chengdu and then Chongqing before returning to Shanghai. However, after the special plane took off from Lanzhou at 8:00 AM, the pilot, Chen Wenkuan, remembered that the east side of Mount 積石 was covered in dense clouds on the 16th, making measurements impossible. To verify this, he decided to refly the area for another survey. The itinerary for the 17th was as follows: The plane took off from Lanzhou Airport at 8:15 AM, flying southwest along the upper reaches of the Yellow River. After about an hour and a half, it flew to the east side of Mount 積石. Slightly south, it flew for 45 minutes to Mount Zheban, about 20,000 feet high, and entered Xikang territory. After 35 minutes, the towering Mount Gongga appeared in front of them. Because the plane was lower than Mount Gongga, its exact height could not be measured. It was estimated to be around 24,500 feet. At this time, the special plane flew directly to Chengdu, because Chen Wenkuan had searched the entire Mount 積石 area and confirmed that there were no high peaks.</p>
<p>In total, the two-day flight took 11 hours, flying 1,760 miles, at an average speed of 160 miles per hour, and an altitude of about 18,000 feet. The first day, when crossing Mount 積石 and reaching Mount 郭洛, the plane climbed to over 21,000 feet. At this time, the temperature in the plane was 12 degrees below zero Celsius, and the average temperature was maintained at about 9 degrees below zero. The second day, when flying to Mount Gongga, Chen Wenkuan originally planned to raise the plane above the high mountain to measure the exact height of Mount Gongga, but because he discovered that the passengers in the plane could not endure it, he was unsuccessful.</p>
<p>After two days of high-altitude flight, the survey work officially came to an end. But this is only the beginning of a great undertaking. As for how to open the door to the natural treasure house and explore the mysteries of the universe, that still awaits future efforts. Mount 積石 is within Chinese territory, and we look forward to our own people writing this brilliant page in the future history of the world!</p>

<h3>In Response to the Serious Situation in Palestine: Britain Urgently Dispatches Troops for Reinforcement; Calls on Arabs and Jews to Ceasefire for Two Days and Nights; Lebanese, Syrian, and Egyptian Governments Deny Dispatching Armed Forces to Participate in the War</h3>
<p>[This newspaper's dispatch] London, broadcast on the 2nd: Jerusalem dispatch, today the British side called for a 48-hour ceasefire between the Arab and Jewish sides. In addition, it is learned that British reinforcements and equipment are being continuously sent to Palestine to deal with the new situation there.</p>
<p>[United Press, Jerusalem, 2nd] The British army issued a statement today, the full text of which is as follows: "The situation in Palestine has greatly deteriorated due to the illegal invasion of Jaffa by the Jewish Irgun militia. The military importance of this region takes precedence over other tasks in the Middle East. For the sake of general security, it is necessary to dispatch a large number of infantry, tanks, artillery, and marines to reinforce Palestine." Qualified sources estimate that the current strength of the British army in Palestine is about 25,000.</p>
<p>[United Press, Jerusalem, 2nd] British military authorities announced today that infantry, tanks, artillery, and marines have been urgently dispatched from Cyprus and Malta to Palestine to cope with the seriously deteriorated situation. Previously, both Jewish and Arab sides claimed that regular armies from Middle Eastern Arab countries such as Syria, Lebanon, and Egypt had invaded the Holy Land from the north and south.</p>
<p>[United Press, Jerusalem, 1st] According to Arab and Jewish sources, regular armies from Middle Eastern Arab countries entered Palestine today from the north and south. Powerful forces from Syria, Lebanon, and Egypt crossed the border at dawn. Saudi Arabia, Transjordan, and Iraq have also ordered troops to the war zone, or completed the final preparations for battle. Syrian and Lebanese troops entering the Holy Land have made contact with Jewish sentries. Meanwhile, according to news from Damascus, Syria has apparently mobilized half of its national army to invade Palestine. It is also learned that Transjordan has ordered the armies of six Arab countries to enter the Holy Land together.</p>
<p>[United Press, Jerusalem, 1st] The Jewish Haganah announced on the 1st that Jewish forces had repelled the powerful forces of the Syrian and Lebanese regular armies attacking northern Palestine. The Haganah radio broadcast claimed that two Arab villages near Safed had been occupied by Jewish forces. Safed is in northern Palestine, 10 miles from the borders of Lebanon and Syria.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Tel Aviv, 1st] The British military headquarters in Jerusalem announced that British and Jewish forces had engaged in the largest battle in Jaffa since the UN passed the partition plan. When the Irgun forces attacked Jaffa again after the ceasefire expired, British forces attacked the Jewish forces with armored vehicles, mortars, and direct-fire guns, killing 70 Jews. The British also suffered 6 fatalities. British forces have now entered the Menshiya district occupied by the Haganah. A Haganah headquarters bulletin stated that after the armies of Syria and Lebanon invaded Palestine, fierce battles broke out with the Jewish forces. The Arab armies used artillery and tanks as cover, and both sides suffered heavy casualties. A Haganah spokesperson also announced that two British destroyers had arrived in Jaffa to evacuate Arabs. Arab reinforcements also arrived in Jaffa under British protection. The Arab military headquarters in Damascus recently issued a bulletin announcing that Arab artillery had bombarded Jewish areas of Jerusalem. Fierce fighting is taking place in Harawi and surrounding areas, and 10 Jews have been killed.</p>
<p>[United Press, London, 1st] The British War Office stated on the 1st that it could not confirm that Palestine had been invaded by Arab countries.</p>
<p>[United Press, Beirut, 1st] Lebanese Foreign Minister Farangiyeh denied on the 1st the report from Tel Aviv that armed forces from Syria and Lebanon had invaded northern Palestine.</p>
<p>[United Press, Cairo, 1st] Egyptian Defense Minister Haidar clearly denied on the 1st the report that Egyptian troops had invaded Palestine.</p>
<h3>The UN Is Filled With Despair: The Holy Land Will Become a Battlefield; Jewish Representatives Urge a Halt to Arab Military Actions</h3>
<p>[United Press, Lake Success, 1st] The United Nations General Assembly has been listlessly debating the Palestine issue for two weeks, and there is still no solution in sight. It is generally believed that the United Nations will stand by and allow the Arab and Jewish sides to fight each other endlessly. Both sides have uniformly criticized the United States' trusteeship plan in the UN Political Committee. As representatives from various countries left the committee chamber to spend the weekend, most felt that a new war was looming in the Holy Land.</p>
<p>Pessimism can be seen in the fact that the US delegation formally proposed a trusteeship plan. The US knew that there was no hope of passing the plan, so it only proposed this plan for reference purposes, and did not intend to push for a decision even when the political committee reconvened on the 3rd. A US official admitted that the US had exhausted all its efforts to persuade Britain and France to send troops to join the international force, but had failed so far, and there were no signs of London or Paris changing their minds. The Soviet Union and its satellite states are expected to launch a major attack on the trusteeship plan before the first trial vote.</p>
<p>[United Press, Jerusalem, 2nd] It was learned today that there is no hope of preventing the Holy Land from becoming a battlefield for large-scale warfare between Jewish people and the regular armies of Arab countries. Unless a United Nations agency quickly approves a plan to replace the partition plan for Palestine, and Britain and the United States declare their unreserved support, neither the Jewish nor Arab sides will yield too much.</p>
<p>[United Press, Lake Success, 1st] Jewish community representatives tonight urged the Security Council to take swift action to stop Arab armies from invading Palestine. It is said that if the Security Council does not intervene, large-scale war is almost inevitable, which will lead to a major conflagration with unimaginable consequences. The Palestinian Jewish defense forces are determined to resist this new aggression at all costs.</p>
<h3>Judgment of Japanese War Criminals: Will Take Three Months to Complete</h3>
<p>Protracted and Lacking Political Significance</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 1st] Our country's jurist, Mei Ru'ao, claimed that the eleven judges of the International Military Tribunal for the Far East are currently not only drafting the judgments of the 25 main Japanese war criminals, but are in fact writing a "true history" of Pacific relations over the past 20 years. Mei continued to say that it will take the judges about three months to complete this "historical document," and that the judgment will not be pronounced until July or even early August. According to Judge Mei's estimate, the future judgment will be as long as 1,000 to 2,000 pages, including appendices. Mei concluded with a philosophical tone: "I have indeed realized that, given the rapid changes in the world situation over the past two years, the trial in Tokyo has lost most of its political significance, but I deeply hope that it will not lose its legal and historical significance."</p>
<h3>Inspection of Japanese Reparations: Work Will Be Completed</h3>
<p>Adopting a Whole-Batch Equipment Distribution Method</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 1st] The work of inspecting 70% of the reparations goods by representatives of the member states of the Far Eastern Commission is nearing completion. These reparations goods will be distributed among these eleven countries, but transport cannot begin until the commission decides on the distribution ratio. The 30% priority transport is currently progressing slowly. To simplify and speed up the process, it is likely that a whole-batch equipment distribution method will be adopted instead of an item-by-item counting method.</p>
<h3>South Korea General Election Bans Parades and Demonstrations; US Authorities Order Martial Law; Korean Communists Launch Large-Scale Guerrilla Warfare on Jeju Island</h3>
<p>[United Press, Seoul, 2nd] US military authorities announced today that the South Korean Communist Party is conspiring to disrupt the general election on May 10th.</p>
<p>[New Asia News Agency, Seoul, 2nd] US military governor of South Korea, Major General Dean, issued Executive Order No. 21 today: "No group may hold parades or demonstrations on May 9th and 10th. Any such actions will be punished as disrupting public order."</p>
<p>[United Press, Seoul, 2nd] Under the instigation of the Communist Party, some Koreans launched large-scale guerrilla warfare on Jeju Island on the 2nd. They attacked a city for three hours, surrounded three villages, and murdered more than seven civilians, four of whom were women. South Korean police reinforcements arrived in Jeju on the 28th and reported that the guerrillas were well-equipped and well-trained. After a three-hour fierce battle, the police defeated the Koreans attacking Dase. Six dead were found in the village. One woman was strangled, and another was stabbed to death. The body of a man was found in the nearby village of Pinni, hacked to death. US reconnaissance planes flew around the area and reported that guerrillas had surrounded the three villages of Pinni, Pamei, and Xinang. Most of the telephone and telegraph lines connecting Jeju City to the villages have been cut.</p>
<h3>Hu Shize Analyzes the Overall Situation in Korea</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, This City Dispatch] Dr. Hu Shize, Secretary-General of the United Nations Commission on Korea, stated to reporters on the 2nd: "The general election originally scheduled for May 10th in South Korea will still be held as scheduled and will not be affected by the North Korean Party Conference." Regarding the future developments in the Korean situation, Hu believed that the following two matters have important decisive effects: First, whether the unification conditions decided by the North Korean Party Conference are accepted by all Korean parties. Second, what is the total number of voters in the upcoming South Korean general election? Regarding the first point, Hu said: The United Nations sincerely hopes that Korea will be unified as soon as possible, but it is also determined not to see it fall under Communist control as a result. Therefore, unless the decisions of the Party Conference can be accepted by all Korean parties, it cannot obtain the support of the United Nations. The current view of the United States is that since North and South Korea are unable to unify under the current situation, it is better for South Korea to become independent first, and then for the South Korean democratically elected government to launch a unification movement, which is easier to start. Regarding the second point, he said that it is difficult to estimate in advance how many people will vote in the South Korean general election, but if the number of voters is too small, it will inevitably cause criticism and have an adverse effect on the Korean situation. Hu's term expires on the 15th of this month, and he will fly back to the United Nations headquarters in the middle of the month.</p>

He said that both parties are brutal, callous, and shameless, and can use other parties that do not sympathize with their goals. They are both good at underground work, eroding from within, and colluding with disloyal elements. It is a great mistake to think that the Communist Party is part of the left wing.

<p>"France" The strikes by the Paris subway and business car workers were the embellishment for May Day. In Toulon, workers attempted to enter the "restricted area" announced by the authorities and clashed with the police. Some workers were slightly injured.</p>
<p>"Italy" In Naples, a group of Communists attempted to sabotage the headquarters of the Italian Social Movement Party. Police intervened, and a widespread conflict between Communists and Fascists immediately broke out in all cafes and streets. Six people were injured and several were arrested.</p>
<p>"Vienna" With 10,000 police officers on high alert, Vienna safely passed May Day.</p>

It is learned that Foreign Minister Bevin opposes going to the United States at present for political psychological reasons, but does not object in principle to senior officials exchanging views on issues involving Western Europe and the Middle East.</p>

A flourishing life suddenly ends, forever sealed in Yaoqiong. You, sir, had a broad and profound spirit, studied abroad, and early on gained a renowned name. You learned from others' mistakes and welcomed them yourself. You soared high and accomplished much. Displaying your talents, you spoke powerfully in forums. Teaching in academies, you were wholeheartedly devoted to the program. No matter how small or large, everything you touched, you poured your heart into it. Evaluating people, your judgment was highly regarded. But you were born in an unfortunate time, when insults and oppressions arose daily. Evil forces acted recklessly, and chaotic signs could not be stopped. As a scholar, you stood firm and steadfast, enduring hardship and danger. You proclaimed the atrocities of the enemy and described their brutal actions. Not out of defamation but to rouse the allied forces. You analyzed issues with clarity, dispelling the haze of confusion. But your good plans were not completed, and you were ordered to travel west. Your great mouth should have remained open, teaching Jing and Shu, your upright spirit shone like the sun and stars. Traveling abroad, you consistently maintained integrity. The enemy leader was defeated, and the fighting subsided. In Shanghai, the atmosphere was glorious and uplifting. When you arrived, everyone eagerly sought your opinion. You expressed your views freely and boldly. You were dedicated to God and devoted yourself to religious service, expounding profound doctrines with sharp insights. You remained humble, and farmers admired your abilities. You laughed and spoke gently, avoiding disputes. Your heart was broad and serene, entrusting your feelings to green waters. You enjoyed gatherings with friends, and your talents became clearer. How could such a great talent not reach his full potential? A moment of suffering ended a lifetime. The news spread, shocking everyone far and wide. With this person gone, who will take his place? We are honored to have known you and are filled with grief. We offer these simple tributes, hoping they will comfort your spirit. May you rest in peace."</p>

<h3>Xu Jizhuang's Extradition to Be Smoothly Resolved: New Evidence Obtained in the Far Ocean Gold Speculation Case</h3>
<p>Regarding the external case of Xu Jizhuang's suspected corruption, the Far Ocean Company's unprecedented large-scale black market gold speculation was reported to the municipal military authorities by foreigner Du Luisui. All the account books and related documents for the black market gold transactions were handed over by Huang Zhong, the former manager of the company, who attempted to blackmail Du, when he was arrested. Recently, the economic department of the municipal military authorities summoned each person involved in the case and questioned them in detail about Xu Jizhuang's involvement in the joint operation of the black market gold trade. The content of the questioning was highly confidential. Sources revealed that the evidence obtained in this case provides a substantial reason for smoothly negotiating Xu Jizhuang's extradition with Hong Kong. Because the case involves an astounding amount of money, Xu Jizhuang's extradition is necessary to resolve the entire matter. According to reporters, the accounting vouchers of the Far Ocean Company's black market gold trading show that a person surnamed He from Hunan Province deposited 800 taels of gold in one transaction. There is also significant evidence of wealthy families engaging in black market gold transactions. The case is currently under further investigation.</p>

<h3>General Commodity Prices Remain Calm and Lack Momentum for Growth</h3>
<p>Due to numerous factors favoring the bearish side this past week, coupled with the fact that Mr. Bei Zuyi, responsible for the U.S. loan, which is the most powerful element in stabilizing commodity prices, is already on his way back to the country, indicating implementation is imminent, the overall market sentiment was generally calm and lacked momentum for growth, except for some positive signs towards the weekend. Compared to the closing prices of the previous weekend, only a few commodities, such as sugar, were relatively firm due to seasonal factors and adjustments in the exchange rate of the Taiwan dollar. The fluctuations of other items were minimal. Based on the wholesale price index compiled by this publication, the index increased by only 1.09% last week.</p>
<p>In terms of credit conditions, the past week saw mixed conditions. The National Bank's clearing situation was tight on Mondays and Fridays, with net inflows around 500 billion, while the remaining days saw little net inflow. Wednesday actually saw a net outflow of 14.2 billion. The black market interest rates frequently decreased, dropping from 27% on Monday to 24% on Wednesday, and then hovering around 25%. Generally, commodity prices have slowed their rise since the second half of March and have maintained a stable state for a considerable period. This publication has previously reported on the main reasons in detail. The following is an analysis of the relevant factors from the past week:</p>
<p>First, the recent increases in the official exchange rate have consistently led to price increases in the market, especially for financial commodities and stocks, which react quickly and closely. However, since the government increased the official exchange rate on April 6, it has remained stable for more than three weeks until the end of last week. Rumors of adjustments have repeatedly surfaced and subsided, reducing a significant stimulus factor for commodity prices.</p>
<p>Second, the widening war zones, with the Northeast in imminent danger and fierce fighting in North China, make it difficult to claim stability even in Central China. Transportation in various areas is severely disrupted, leading to stagnant sales for merchants and reduced actual demand. Shanghai is experiencing an accumulation of inventory and even abnormal phenomena such as work stoppages and production cuts. Furthermore, during this time of suppression of rebellion, the government's economic controls are constantly emerging, causing genuine distress for businesses. This has led to a serious economic crisis, namely the relocation of industrial production equipment to the south and the large-scale flow of speculative capital southward. Conversely, in Hong Kong and Guangdong, this has caused price increases and a sharp decline in the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate. This characteristic can be observed in the recent two-week contraction of the exchange rate from 8.78 Hong Kong dollars per million legal tender to just over 7 Hong Kong dollars. Regarding the industrial production equipment relocated to Hong Kong, for example, in the textile industry, it is claimed that no fewer than a dozen factories have already opened or are preparing to open, with a total of approximately 190,000 spindles.</p>
<p>Third, according to Ren Xianqun, chairman of the People's Food Allocation Committee, the first phase of the government's rice policy, which is a trial run for four months, will expire at the end of June. July, August, and September are the lean months between harvests. If the allocation of rice is not continued, it will have adverse consequences. Therefore, the committee unanimously decided to continue the allocation. This decision will have a significant impact on stabilizing rice prices, and fluctuations in rice prices will play a major role in overall commodity prices.</p>
<p>Fourth, in addition to the aforementioned more obvious reasons for the recent stability of commodity prices, psychological factors are also very important. Because commodity prices have been stable for a considerable period and negative factors still exist, the public's expectations for commodity prices differ from the previous trend of continued increases. This psychological expression can be found in both the stock and commodity markets. In the stock market, both buyers and sellers are adopting a wait-and-see attitude, and trading is scarce. In the commodity market, goods are being released, supply exceeds demand, and actual sales are weak.</p>
<p>Fifth, because Shanghai's commodity prices have reached a considerable level, some items are more expensive than in other cities, such as the current market price of cotton cloth in Guangzhou, which is lower than in Shanghai. Therefore, demand from Guangdong merchants is very weak.</p>
<p>In addition, new measures related to commodity prices last week include:</p>
<p>First, the National Bank's Discount and Loan Committee was officially established on the 27th. This year's National Bank loan policy was previously determined by the Four Joint Offices as two major categories: national policy loans and production enterprise loans. National policy loans should be reviewed by the secretariat of the Four Joint Offices in consultation with the Central Bank and then submitted to the Board of Directors for approval or reported to the chairman and vice chairman. All business loan cases will no longer be directly handled by the Four Joint Offices but should be referred to the Central Bank and specialized banks for review. Subsequently, on April 9, the Four Joint Offices passed the Central Bank's Discount and Loan Committee Organization Regulations at its 366th Board of Directors meeting, stipulating the committee's duties as: A. Matters related to the decision of the Central Bank's discount policy; B. Review of applications from fellow members; C. Approval of rediscount and remortgage interest rates; D. Other matters related to discounts and loans. At the establishment of this Discount and Loan Committee, President Zhang of the National Bank stated, "From now on, the National Bank will not directly issue loans but will only handle rediscounts and remortgages for each bank. State-owned and commercial banks will be treated equally. The targets of loans are healthy production enterprises that meet the current needs of the country, thereby achieving the healthy operation of each bank and cultivating good commercial paper to guide funds into production." From this, it can be seen that the Central Bank is gradually moving towards becoming a "bank of banks." During this period of economic turmoil, price fluctuations are closely related to discount policies. It is not easy to detect the choices between supporting legitimate production and inducing hoarding and speculation. We hope that it will be handled well, and we will wait and see for factual proof.</p>
<p>Second, the long-awaited short-term treasury bills were officially issued by the National Bank on the 30th, initially for a period of one month. The discount rate will be determined daily by the Treasury Bill Interest Rate Committee. The discount rate on the 30th was set at 87.3.</p>
<p>Third, the Cotton Yarn and Cloth Management Committee previously prohibited the transportation of cotton yarn and cloth to the south from February 24 to stabilize the rise in cotton yarn and cloth prices in Shanghai. The committee believes that the market price of cotton yarn and cloth has recently stabilized and decided to lift the ban on the transportation of cotton yarn and cloth to the south from April 25, and announced this to the public.</p>
<p>Under the aforementioned conditions, the general trend of commodity prices last week remained relatively stable. Foreign stocks showed some improvement, while the Chinese stock market was more subdued. However, because there was no for Chinese stocks, and banks and securities firms aggressively bought it up, coupled with rumors of currency reform in the market, the rising trend was firm. More details are covered in the stock market section of this publication below. Because sales of cotton yarn and cloth were stagnant and domestic demand was also weak, merchants were mostly focused on selling. Factory inventories piled up, and the market was flat. For example, 42-count cotton yarn hovered around 235 million, and Shuangma 21-count cotton yarn did not exceed 160 million. The closing price of Longtou fine cloth on the weekend was very close to the closing price of the previous weekend. The rice market experienced minor fluctuations because of the Civil Affairs Commission's decision to continue the food ration program in July, August, and September, which softened market sentiment. However, by the weekend, the Civil Affairs Commission announced an increase in the retail price of rice for the next period, stimulating rice prices to rise. For example, premium white rice in the North Shanghai market exceeded the 4 million mark on the weekend, closing at 4.15 million. The trend of coarse grains was also quite narrow. The flour market initially declined and then rebounded. For example, Bingshun No. 1 flour fell from 1.4 million per bag on Monday to 1.385 million after Wednesday, then rebounded on the weekend, exceeding the 1.4 million mark. Due to seasonal factors, sales of sugar gradually increased, and the Taiwan dollar exchange rate was adjusted. The allocation price of Taiwan sugar increased, with all grades of Taiwan sugar increased by 500,000 per bag from the 18th period. The market price showed some positive signs. Other commodities, such as chemicals and metals, experienced minimal increases, while building materials trended downward.</p>

<h3>Monetary and Financial Situation</h3>
<p>(1) Credit Conditions and Black Market Interest Rates</p>
<p>Generally speaking, credit conditions in Shanghai this past week remained relatively relaxed. Although speculative funds have been flowing into the city, the extremely low general purchasing power has caused buyers to adopt a wait-and-see attitude. The resulting oversupply of funds in the market is also a factor that cannot be ignored. One financial industry insider commented, "The current abundance of funds is the most significant seen this year. This is partly due to the public's wait-and-see attitude towards commodity prices and partly due to the clear evidence of severe inflation." This is a truly insightful statement.</p>
<p>In the commercial banking sector, the demand for loans is low, while the supply of funds is becoming increasingly abundant. As a result, the black market interest rates have continued to decline, dropping to 24% on Wednesday and Thursday, and even falling below the interest rate for interbank lending, to around 20%. As for the off-exchange interest rates for securities firms, they fell from 22 yuan on Tuesday to 19 yuan on Wednesday, and short positions also dropped by 3 yuan. Since the official establishment of the National Bank's Discount and Loan Committee on Tuesday, there has been a belief that lending will be restored soon, making interbank lending even more difficult. The net output of funds from banks after the 60th day decreased from over 390 billion on Monday to 20 billion on Wednesday, indicating the abundance of funds within the industry. Although there was a net outflow of over 590 billion on Thursday, interbank lending remained limited due to the large reserves held by banks. There was also a very abundant supply of cash. On Monday, banks used 230-300 billion in cash to settle outstanding obligations with the National Bank, and the amount of cash settled on Thursday also reached around 100 billion.</p>
<p>The total net inflow of funds to state-owned banks and treasuries from Monday to Thursday was as high as over 1.1 trillion. However, after deducting the 980 billion in fixed deposits submitted by commercial banks to the National Bank over the four days, the net inflow to state-owned banks and treasuries was still 200 billion. However, this inflow did not seem to have any impact on the market.</p>
<p>Short-term treasury bills were officially issued on Friday, with a discount rate equivalent to</p>
<h3>Strengthening Liaison Training for Local Land, Sea, and Air Force Officers; Collective Corps Operations; Ministry of National Defense Dispatches Senior Officials to Shanghai to Preside; Garrison Headquarters Actively Prepares to Hold Training in Three Batches</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Garrison Headquarters recently received an order from the Ministry of National Defense stating that due to the special environment of the city and the large number of stationed troops, although the Garrison Headquarters is in charge of overall command, there are still imperfections in terms of actual liaison and combat. Therefore, to meet the needs of the environment, it is urgently necessary to conduct joint and unified training and hold "Joint Collective Corps Operations Training for Senior Land, Sea, and Air Force Officers." Military organizations in the city include the First Naval Base Command, the Shanghai Port Command, the Wusong Fortress Command, the Air Force Supply Command, the Shanghai Garrison Headquarters, the 202nd Division of the Youth Army, the 9th Regiment of the Military Police, and the Police Bureau, possessing substantial military strength. The Garrison Headquarters is now actively preparing for this training, aiming to hold it in the shortest possible time. The training is planned to be conducted in three batches, with bureau chiefs, section chiefs, inspector generals, and chiefs of staff as the first batch, section heads and directors as the second batch, and section members and other relevant personnel as the third batch. Each person will be given appropriate operational training knowledge within the shortest possible time according to their talents, strengthening mutual communication and understanding of collective corps operations. The Ministry of National Defense has dispatched senior officials to Shanghai to preside over the training, and the commanders of various military organizations in the city will be important responsible persons in the training, with the aim of unifying the pace and coherence of the city's land, sea, and air forces. As for the training location, it has also been selected within a certain district of the city, held in a large building. The training time for each batch is relatively short, so the training subjects are extremely essential.</p>
<h3>The Civil Affairs Committee's Review Meeting; Miao Jiaming Expresses Appreciation to Staff; More Than 80 Million US Dollars Worth of Food Will Soon Be Shipped to China</h3>

<h3>Fisheries Materials Symposium Held Today in the Capital</h3>

<h3>Lending Fishing Vessels for Armed Escort Is a Violation of the Agreement and Is Not Permitted</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Jiang-Zhejiang fisheries organizations had previously jointly requested the Rehabilitation Affairs Committee to allocate two new fishing vessels for arming in order to prevent pirates from harassing fishermen while fishing. It is now learned that the Rehabilitation Affairs Committee, after receiving the letter, conducted several studies and ultimately concluded that this action would violate the UNRRA's agreement with China and could not be approved. A letter of apology has been sent to the organizations. According to the agreement between UNRRA and the Chinese government, UNRRA's supplies to China are only for rehabilitation, reconstruction, and relief, and may not be used for military purposes. If UNRRA's fishing vessels are now equipped with weapons, it would be a violation of the purpose of relief supplies.</p>

<h3>Galvanized Iron Industry Appeals That Raw Material Panic Will Lead to a Dead End</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The Shanghai Galvanized Iron Industry Association, due to the panic of raw materials, the industry will be in a dead end. Yesterday, they received reporters and reported on the recent situation of the industry. The main raw materials of the industry, such as galvanized iron, tinplate, zinc sheet, and black iron sheet, rely on imports from abroad. They are then processed and manufactured by the industry into daily necessities, various mechanical accessories, and moisture-proof packaging for export trade. There are more than 1,200 shops in the city engaged in this industry, with more than 10,000 workers. However, since the foreign exchange control, the main raw material galvanized iron sheet is not allowed to be imported, and other quota-limited imported raw materials are monopolized by importers and hardware vendors, causing the industry to only be able to purchase raw materials under the double exorbitant profit exploitation of importers and hardware vendors, and the selling price is more than 2 million times higher than before the war. Due to the panic of raw materials and high costs, it is difficult to maintain, and more than 200 companies have already closed down. Recently, the industry has sent representatives to appeal to the Import Control Committee, the Industrial and Commercial Guidance Office, the Social Affairs Bureau, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, and other departments, requesting the authorities to allow the import of galvanized iron sheets and to relax the import volume of other raw materials. In the quota allocation of the imported products, the industry is allowed to join the allocation.</p>
