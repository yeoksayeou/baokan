<p>〔中央社華盛頓廿四日電〕杜魯門。馬歇爾暨美國防方面高級官員，自廿二日起，卽在商討是否可能予刻在危難中之中國政府以更多援助之問題。此間今晚獲悉，此項高級官員商討中國問題之會議，刻尙未結束，一俟渠等獲得最後決議時，美國卽將發表一項對華政策之正式聲明。馬歇爾今與杜魯門會談廿五分鐘，僉信其談話內容係關於中國問題。但馬歇爾仍持其一貫作風，對此事默不作一語。美國負賣釐定國防戰略曁外交政策之安全委員會，昨夜亦在白宮舉行重要會議，但會議內容則無所悉。美國此後將更採取何種行動援助中國政府，乃各界最關切及猜測之問題，主張全面援華及袖手旁視之兩極端派，皆擁有大批人士，而爭辭不休，但美政府官員之態度則仍屬秘密。</p>
<p>〔中央社華盛頓廿四日電〕馬歇爾廿四日下午招待記者時，曾就中國情勢口頭上作一簡短表示，但不說明在目前危機中，美國將採何政策，亦未特別述及將以何項援助給予中國政府。馬氏開始討論中國情勢時，强調稱：美國面臨之一大問題，卽爲在目前之危機中，美國究能作何妥適措施，眞正匡助時艱。馬氏繼稱：考慮茲事時，須明白記取美國究能在何項條件之下有所行動此則復與國會之行動有關。渠並特別提及是否有可資使用之物資問題及美國牽入中國漩渦之問題，渠宣稱：此乃須予以謹愼考慮之非常困難問題。馬氏繼對四月間通過之四億美元軍事與經濟援華計劃加以檢討，據謂：其中一億二千五百萬元之軍事贈予，有相當數量之飛機汽油，其他則爲軍事供應品，其大部爲裝備。渠提及美國可資使用之供應品及物資之問題稱：現正竭盡一切努力，加速行動，以海軍輪隻與商船載運物資赴華。至此，馬氏忽結束其有關中國之談話稱：今日下午余擬就中國情勢發表之意見，已盡於此。按在今日到會記者人數空前之記者招待會中，中國危機乃會衆所最關切之問題，唯新聞記者仍未自馬歇爾處探知有關美國態度之具體表示。記者詢諸馬氏，中國問題是否可望於最近數日內加以廓淸，渠答稱：不擬對此發表意見．某記者因不滿於馬氏之保留態度，而向渠發問稱：美國是否並無一項對華政策，馬氏復答稱：無意見。另一記者詢馬氏國務院是否將向下屆國會建議增加對華援助，馬氏亦予以同樣空無所有之答覆。馬氏今日似極不願對中國情勢多加討論，顯而易見者，自週一以來，馬歇爾。社魯門曁其他政府官員間，對中國局勢之商討，尙未獲得任何明確結論。在未作最後決定前，白宮與國務院皆不擬發表任何正式聲明。</p>

<p>— 平倫</p>
<p>作者爲國內之權威經濟學者，對修正金圓券發行辦法及修正人民所有金銀外幣處理辦法，有透澈的意見，但不願發表其姓名。本報因重視其論證，特爲介紹披露。　編者識。</p>
<p>自本月十二日政府公布修正金圓劵發行辦法及修正人民所有金銀外幣處理辦法以後，政府經濟政策適與八一九之政策向相反的方向發展。金圓之法定含金量由純金〇·二二二一七公分降落到四·四四三四公毫，四比一的美匯匯率變成有條件的二〇比一，黄金白銀銀幣由禁止持有到准許持有，且有條件的兌現。以不及三個月之時間，政府政策轉變到相反之極端，許多人一定駭怪於政府之孟浪，幷譴實政府之無信。若細加分析，則知此一轉變乃事實之必然，政府勇敢變更決策，毋寗謂爲深合時宜而極明智之舉。蓋八一九經濟緊急處分令，欲以純粹政治手段解決經濟問題，攷慮似欠週密。關於此點，筆者實不勝其感慨。</p>
<p>自卅五年法幣加速貶値後，市塲上黄金美鈔之投機日益加甚，社會輿論及若干淺識之徒，常發爲黄金國有之呼聲。筆者前曾以專家資格參加中央某設計機關工作，看到不少黄金國有的計劃，此外主管部內亦有此項未成熟之計劃，民國卅五年夏財政當局且曾將此項計劃徵詢筆者之意見。當時筆者曾提出二個證辯：（一）如何國有？國有並不是從人民手中收奪，而是以一定價格從人民手中收購，一方收購黄金，另一方卽是放出通貨。果爾，則與公開市塲運用Open　Market　Operation之膨脹政策何異？現在物價高漲，芷宜收縮，何能採取膨脹政策？中央銀行拋售黄金政策當作短時應付緊急之手段，並無錯誤，其可議之點在過分抑低黄金及外匯價格，使國家喪失金鈔太速耳。今如反其道而行之，一舉收購黄金國有，遊資出籠，物價高翔，何以善後？（二）黄金爲一般人民之儲蓄手段。先王之政在制民之產，使足以仰事俯蓄，今日政府無暇及此，任何人並無怨　，若幷唯一之儲蓄手段而禁絕之，後果實不堪設想。試思人民之辛勤所獲，無儲蓄之方法，通貨貶値又無法阻過，人誰不防護自身之利益？結果，唯有浪費及囤積物資之一途，較之對金鈔投機，嚴重萬倍，且人民千百年之習慣，非一朝可以扭轉，强爲扭之，必召紛擾。印度改行金匯兌本位政策，停用硬幣，遠在中國採行法幣政策十年以前，迄至現在，民間藏金之豐富在世界猶爲第一，其金銀之吐納，使世界金銀市塲均生影響，而政府尙絕不敢冒人民之憤怒而禁制之，今日何日，我豈可自召紛擾？當時筆者並主張開放證劵市塲，增加人民之儲蓄手段。並謂今日提出黄金國有之主張者，無非鑒於黄金投機太甚，有助於信用之膨脹，思加根絕，殊不知金鈔投機乃通貨貶値之自然結果，政府對通貨貶値不能不負責任，豈可徒譴責人民之投機？財政當局當設法使收支差額减少，收縮通貨，穩定幣値，杜絕金鈔投機之源，切勿以人民握有金鈔爲慮。當時財政當局採納了筆者之意見，使最近一個月以前之恐慌未在二年前發生，總算幸事。若將篆者當時之論辯與今年八一九後之事實對照，則徐財長建議政府之修正辦法，實爲函敢合時之舉，於安定人心，安定經濟，當有絕大助力。</p>
<p>八一九後另一可議之點，爲限價政策之嚴格使用。社會的經濟狀况，變動不息，縱在通貨狀態不變之條件下，相對價格仍適應供求狀態，時時變勸。平常學理上之安定物價政策，乃指安定物價水準，決不是限定個別價格。在本年八一九之前一星期，某大員曾以管制物價管制經濟相詢，筆者力陳其不可，謂不能控制生產與供給，徒然硬性管制經濟及價格，必召災禍。中國的生產單位有如原子式之夥多，生產消費之意向及動機，決非政府法令所能控制。某大員如回思筆者過去之言論，當亦深滋感慨。主張管制者，動以英國及其他西方各國之管制政策相標榜，而不深考其他各國之管制，縱有成功者，亦無不遵循經濟原則，否則亦必召致失敗。各國之管制，原則上乃增加時殊事業之利潤，變更各項事業之相對地位，並助生產元素之移動，使符合政府之計劃。中國之管制者，何嘗顧到此等原則？中國之客觀條件，亦何能廣泛適用此種計劃？卽引西方事例：大恐慌以前（一九二九—一九三三）美國聯邦農事局（Federal　Farm　Board）之干涉政策，埃及政府對棉花市塲之干涉，均因忽視經濟原則而失敗，結果徒使政府喪失資金，市塲的正常活動均被僵化，但其嚴重遠不及中國此次之甚。英國國內誠然實行全面配售，但工商業者仍有出口可做。一九四六年冬筆者在英時，攷查英國出口巳恢復到戰前百分之九十七，他們計劃於一九四八年度使出口增加到戰前百分之一百七十，決不似中國八一九後堵住一切利潤之源，使經濟機能完全僵化。說到此點，政府似未接受專家意見。八一九緊急處分令，事先諱英如深，據筆者事後所知，政府若千大員亦並不同情，一二奉命執行人員，均懷着痛苦與矛盾的心情去執行；惟有決定權力之「外行」則反而特別起勁。過去在抗戰時期，管制及限價曾試騐多次，均遭逢無情之失敗，亦不　資爲借鏡。現在限價取消了，自由市塲恢復了，兩次修正辦法公佈了，政府的政策已回到合理的途徑。我們對過去譴實無益，怨對無用，惟有在新政策下，全國一致，通力合作，方能克服當前難關。列寗之軍事共產主義，在餓死千萬人以後，勇敢糾正錯誤，始仍得鞏固其政權，我們絕對用不着悲觀。</p>
<p>其次，筆者對於修正辦法之本身，亦願表示數點意見：（一）金圓券對黄金之比例由二〇〇變成一〇〇〇，對銀元之比例由二變成一〇，對美鈔之比例由四變成二〇，一切尙附上同額存款之條件方能兌現。若干人或指摘政府背信，收奪了守法人民大部分的財富。此一事實，誠不可否認。但我們須從大處着想，政府此時實有穩定金圓券價値之義務與必要。中國當數十年戰爭以後，社會及國家之財富，均至爲有限，生產力亦未恢復，任何專家執政，亦祇能就國家已有之財富，尋覓貨幣價値之自然水準。如過份高估金圓券之價値，國家兌現之諾言無法完全履行，則金圓券根本不能安定。試思一個月前之社會經濟，幾致破滅，誠令人不寒而慄。此時此地政府所應致力及能致力的，不是對每一個人的公平問題，而是如何獲得穩定的幣值，安定的經濟，使今後生產增加，全體均蒙利益的問題，如斷斷計較每一個人的公平問題，則全盤問題仍不能解決，於事何補？過去守法受損的人民，如想到此點，亦必能心安理得，無所怨戀了。（下接第四版）</p>

<p>〔法國新聞社倫敦廿五日電〕英外部方面消息稱：法國允許參加魯爾管制委員會，業已由英美兩國十九日在馬歇爾麥克尼爾及許曼於巴黎開會時加以檢討。英美原先之目的，本擬在德境四方三佔區合併後始行邀法參加，故今日英美不待三佔區合併而卽允許法國參加之行動，各方僉認此係英美對法之讓步。</p>

<p>〔聯合社華盛頓廿四日電〕國務卿馬歇爾今日向記者稱，美英兩國擬不顧法國之反對，以魯爾區煤礦及鋼鐵工業交還德人管理。同時美政府亦準備繼續採取各種措施，以防德國　武主義之復活。佔領軍繼續留駐德國，魯爾區治安可無問題。余巳邀請法國參加英美煤鐵委會，帮助審查各項安全措施。最後之安全措施，當在對德和約中規定。安全委會卽將設立，以便繼續檢查德工業。法國人民以其和平與自由可能遭受威脅爲慮，美國人民深表同情，但魯爾區工業之改組，乃援助西德與整個歐洲所迫切需要。爲擴大生產起見，交還德人管理事關重要。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社莫斯科廿五日電〕莫斯科電合評論魯爾問題稱：法國現巳證明淪爲次要國家，該國之意見亦不爲英美兩國所重視。不獨此也，在英美政治表現中，美國之操縱一切及高壓手段已日趨明顧。又稱：德境美軍總司令克萊與英軍總司令羅勃森所公布之第七十五條法律，將魯爾交與私人資本經營，此爲英向美最後投降。英國前此之主張，係力持魯爾工業必須社會化者也。美國恢復德國私人獨佔之觀點完全勝利，係與美國獨佔資本家有密切關係。</p>

<p>私立中小學教職員聯誼會代表施駕東·王允一·馮振·夏煥新四人，於昨日下午六時赴市府請願，向奧市長提出四點要求：（一）請市長明白表示對此次私校收費是否合理。（二）私校教職員應與市校教職負同享實物配給。（三）請市長澈查濫發談話造成私校嚴重危機之李代局長。（四）請市長制裁惡意謾罵侮辱私校之電台及實施者。吳市長首說明此次私校收費經過情形稱：私校校長前因教職員生活困苦，維持困難，要求政府救濟，除特配米允提先發給外，要求政府補貼，則因市庫拮据未能辦到，原則上乃允酌再增收學費以補助教職員生活，但爲顧及家長負担，對增收教額囑各校校長與教局商談。旋私校校長郎自行開會決定增收二倍至四倍，以電話通知李局長，此在手續上極不合理。因向來商討學費問題應先與教局商量，再由市府會同參議會及各方面代表共同核定，務使學校開支，教職員生活，及家長負担均能兼顧，而此次私校增收學費事，由校長開會決定後通知教局，便算了事，於手績上殊爲不合。</p>
<h3 id="c65">敎職員生活困苦　應由校長負責任 <a href="#c65" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e65" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">65</a></h3>
<p>嚴格言之，私校增收費用並不合理，學生家長於學期初一次付淸學費，卽猶與校方訂立合同，應由校方負責該學生一學期之教學，而校方亦一次付淸教職員六個月之薪津。然因此次物價波動甚劇，教職員一次領得之薪津不一定買下日用必需品，爲顧念教職員生活困難，故渠甘冒不韙准予再酌收學費，但不能增至四倍之多。此一責任不在教職員，而應由各校校長負之。故對要求之（一）答覆爲酌予增收，但手續不合。（二）要求私校教職員與市校同樣配售實物事，吳市長表示市校係按月發薪，私校則於學期初一次發淸一學期之薪金，私校待遇已優於市校，况政府無如許實物配給，故事實上辦不到。（三）要求澈查李代局長事，吳市長表示渠將先追究造成此次糾紛之責任，李局長爲何幾次通知校長商談而校長均不出席。（四）要求制裁電台上惡言謾罵私校事，吳市長聲稱、據所知，被罵者爲校長，與教職員無關。代表之一立卽聲稱教職員亦有被罵者，如筱快樂卽曾在電台指稱校長爲老闆，教師爲妓女，學生爲嫖客。吳市長聞悉卽表示市府爲行政機關，除通知社會局勸止惡言謾罵外，教職員如認爲有被侮辱之處，儘可訴諸法院。</p>
<h3 id="c66">市長對敎職員　表示完全同情 <a href="#c66" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e66" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">66</a></h3>
<p>市長表示渠對教職員完全同情，但一部份校長之行爲不能同情。戒嚴令下總請假之舉於法不合，况此次總請假，師出無名，故盼卽復教。最後市長設表處理辦法四點：（一）學費究竟增收多少，待邀請參議會等各方而共同核定。（二）此次增收所得之學費應歸教職員保管，校長不准動用分文。（三）已向學生增收費用之學校，將澈底查賬。（四）責成校長立卽勸導教職員銷假復教，以維學生學業。校長如有不對，將請校黄會撤換，否則由市府派人接替。</p>

<p>上海市商會爲請疏導貨運及游資，並取銷議價制度，恢復自由市塲，曁豁免卅八年度上半期所得稅，昨分電　政院，財政部，工商部略云：</p>
<p>制止阻關阻運　俾使貨暢其流</p>
<p>竊查地方政府阻遏物資出境之舉筆始於限價政策之嚴格推行縱白一本年十月卅日政府公布財經改革補充辦法，明白規定地方政府，不得妨碍貨物流通，其有擅自阻關阻運，從嚴　辦，但其間未免有格於成例，或未奉明令，仍阻滯貨運之事，應請鈞院，部切實制止，俾使貨暢其流，供求十衡，以助物價之穩定，此其一。查證交停業，發端於幣制改革之初，其目的當不外澈底消弭投機，間接助成八一九限價政策之完成。茲者限價取消，情勢已變，而環顧此後政策之推進，似應以扶植生產，疏導游資爲急務，證交之設，主要爲執行生產事業與投資者之媒介，並吸收游資進入投資正軌之任務，今後若欲振興生產事業，以及制止游資作祟，應卽毅然准令證交復業，此其二。</p>
<p>廢除核本定價　恢復自由市場</p>
<p>物價漲低，有其經濟上之自然法則，所謂物稀則貴，物衆則賤，若不從增加生產疏導貨源努力，而以强抑物價之自然變化爲得計，則遏江河而東流，其不逼而積決者幾希過去限價政策之失敗，可爲殷鑑。自政府頒布財經改革補充辦法，取消限價之後，物價縱一度昇騰，近則漸趨平靖，其距在漲時回跌一半以上甚多，此皆貨源旣暢，供求漸趨正常之反映，惜補充辦法未能澈底開放限價，尙留核本定價之議價制度，其流弊頗使產鎖雙方，未能完全鐲免脫節之苦境，以是生產方面，尙感原料之供應爲難，而銷售商亦有核本定價之煩阻，實有背乎經濟自然法則。蓋從純經濟立塲言，物價之漲跌，旣有其自然之水準，則與其揚湯止沸，曷若斧底抽薪，如能廢除核本定價辦法，澈底恢復自由市塲，一方面仍嚴格取締囤積居奇，並切實疏導貨源，扶植生產以及引游資於正軌，則物價穩定，可操左券，此其三。</p>
<p>損益科目處理　請豁免所得稅</p>
<p>又查最近公佈施行之「營利事業資本額折算金圓變更登記辦法」第八條第二項規定：「估定後資產减除全部負債所得之資本額，超過本辦法所定標準時，其超過部份，應以損益科目處理…」。關於「應以損益科目處理」一語，原草案所無，而爲修正時增入者，其主旨不外資產估計伸値之超過標準資太額部份，應視爲營利事業之所得，令其繳納所得我，殊不知是項資產估計伸値之部份，並非事業本身之所得，純係歷年幣値低落一且調整回復之表現，在事業之純資產上，絕無增益，故令其依法繳納所得稅，實非合理，此點亦應予改正，藉恤工商之艱困，此其四。自改革幣制實行限價政策以後，原料受阻，生產萎縮，搶購風熾，十店九空，限價開放，物價暴　，商店以原幣進貨，扞閱甚鉅，有至無力再行復業者。政府爲嘉惠工商計，自應有所謀以補救，該公會請爲建議中央准予豁免營利事業卅八年度上半年所得稅（卽卅七年下半年營利事業之所得）一節，亦不得不謂迫切之合理要求，此其五云云　。　遵令登記各種貨品　不當按照限價收購</p>
<p>又該會以工商業遵令登記之各種貨品，不當按照限價收購事，電呈社會局略云：查自重要民生日用品及工業原料，改爲核本定價以後，自不能再以限價相繩，由公家强制照限價收購，予守法商民以不應有之打擊。如謂此項登記物品，其成本價格，多在八一九限價之下，不妨以限價征收，則以限價出售之後，而以十數倍或數十倍之市價補進，在工廠商號，惟有破產，其理甚明。似此情形，無異沒收其登記物品，公家爲優待一部份國民，而使工商業蒙受不應有之犧牲，何異以隣爲堅。况總登記範圍中之物品其爲個人或家庭生活所必需者，祗有米，麵粉，布，食油，煤，糖等，至於呢羢，香菸等類，則旣不在取締日用重要物品之內，更不在日用品總登記之列，似尤朱便運類而及，漫無抉別。竊以國家當此艱處，固結民心，爲第一義，處理之策，首在奉行憲法第七條所謂「中華民國人民無分階級，在法律上一律平等」之規定，敬抒管見，仰祈鈞局據情核轉，發抒正論，庶涸轍之附，得慶更生，實爲公便。</p>
<p>附有定期存單黃金　呈請准許流通轉讓</p>
<p>復次，該會爲據會員大會決議，請建議政府，凡黄金附有同額之定期存單者，睛准許流通轉讓，以昭幣信，昨亦分電行致院財政部，請予採納施行。</p>

<p>（二）關於有條件兌現的問題，政府確實受了重大的負担。本來在管理通貨下，國內的兌現已無必要，一切黄金外匯均集中使用，作爲國際收支空額之工具；卽當强之美國亦不例外。他們的通貨價値如何維持？第一，通貨之數量嚴格適應於社會經濟之需求；第二，在償付國際收支差額時，黄金外匯仍依固定的比例動用，通貨在國內一律是紙幣，但在外匯市塲上仍有固定的標準存在，國際收支義務仍嚴格履行。在正常時候，通貨不過是交換的媒介，持有者如能按照固定的比例，在必要時能取得外匯或黄金償付國際收支差額，亦不會動搖對幣値的信心。二十四年的法幣政策，就是在這一個理論上建設成功的。不幸此一自然而合理的辦法，現在巳無法使用，經過法幣及過去金圓券的加速貶値，人民對不兌現的紙幣已失信心，只有飛離通貨（Flied　from　the　Currency），飛離通貨卽無異通貨的破滅。挽救此一危機，除兌現外，別無他途。英鎊在歷史上也曾數度發生此類災禍，亦運用兌現政策方克服之。不過兌現義務的履行，實爲政府重大的負担。兌現的義務，與金圓券發行額必成正比例的發展，甚至超比例的發展，政府對於此點，應隨時警戒。財政上必需使收支逐漸接近平衡，一方面培養稅源，增加收入，一方面裁减不必要之支出，金融上需停止助長膨脹之低利政策。在正常時，中央銀行掛牌利率領導市塲利率，在膨脹時，在市塲利率逼致中央銀行掛牌利率隨之變動。如中央銀行不顧市塲情况，始終維持低利政策，遊資旣不同籠，貸放日益擴大，通貨數量增加過速，幣値的穩定，兌現的實踐，勢必大感困難。我們預料到修正辦法實行後，幣値必逐漸獲致安定，人民的信心自可恢復，次一步就需考慮有條件的週密的開放外匯問題。因爲在長期，與其用金銀穩定幣値不如用外匯穩定幣値經濟得多（可以節省幣材），效力亦無二致。比一遠景，暫時不必詳陳。但政府當局，不能不預先籌劃。至於應付金鈔黑市問題，我們對於兩項修芷辦法，不能有過分之期待，外匯買賣旣不完全開放，金銀亦祗有條件的兌現，金鈔黑市短時期內勢必仍然存在。兌換金銀，旣需支付同額之存款，其不願履行此一條件同時又思持有金銀之人，必出高價在市塲營求。但黑市縱然存在，價格必在固定之限度內迴旋，故價值標準無論如何可以建立，穩定之經濟必可在穩定之幣值標準下產生。且人民儲蓄金銀決無可懼，唯在價値標準不存在時肆黨浪費或囤積物資，則眞爲國民經濟上之致命傷。過去金融管理，集全力於查禁金鈔白銀之持有，可謂捨本逐末，間時亦喪失人心。事實上，金融管理應有其合理之範圍，過去當局未能於積極方面多下功夫，殊爲遺憾，想今後財政當局必能於比有所主張。又金鈔市塲市價與官價加有差額，則外匯結匯證明書制度之恢復，亦爲順理成章之事，蓋必如是，官市兩率始可趨於一致，藉以刺激出口，並吸收僑匯，以利新貨幣制度之推行也</p>
<p>最後，筆者提出兩點期望：第一，希望政府能多採納專家之意見。財政經濟問題實在太複雜，不容自作聰明，中國社會並非無人才，人才沉淪在下，政府無接近之方，實是國家的大損失。第二，希望不懂專門問題的「外行」有力人士，對於專門問題，稍安緘默。財政經濟，非有十年學力，大可免開尊口，就是能搬出幾本外國教科書，也未必能算數，何况只讀些百科全書之類，有什麼用？必須就全盤社會科學領域有宏通之了解，並與本國文化傳統融成一氣，方能對中國之財政經濟有發言資格。億萬人的生命財產，決不能任「外行」一再嘗試！數十年來的敎訓，夠慘痛了！</p>

<p>昨日米市，南市塲平定，北市一塲下降，因實銷呆滯，米店納胃甚淡，到貨仍暢，尤以南港早晚稻及薄稻新貨登塲，產地價低，供應多而去化呆，北市白粳退至　白五十五元，薄稻四百三十元，早稻等各低二十五至二十元。南市價格厚薄粳勉强站定，早稻降五元，後市更疲，且乏受主。陰元。白元市勢最軟。昨日南市到貨四千二百二十六石，北市五十六百〇四石，合計近萬石。</p>
<p>麵粉續續下游，由於實銷呆木，貨主不耐高息，均有脫手之想，故市勢疲不能興。老車粉以一百四十元開出，兵船一百三十五元，各降五元至七元，紅蜂建成各低二三元，雄牌粉供應充斥，價降三四元不等。麩皮鄉銷尙活，價格站定，小麥一百八十元。</p>
<p>雜糧一致再挫，市氣萎靡，賣勢甚盛，但實銷頗呆，欲售不易，價乃下降。黄豆廠方不取，乍豆最後一百五十五元，約降十元。紅糧供多銷呆，疲五元，苞米北帮略有染指，價勉强站定。元麥·菉豆交易不多，市稱平定。揀靑價無上落，之蔴削低二三十元，生仁到多，降五六十元。</p>
<p>食油在售多銷滯下，價格終吿再降，因本街納胃呆，客銷不動，廠方開出不少，苦少受主。豆袖七百六十元，取低七百三十元，降落五十元。生菜油六百十及五百九十元，降二十元。生油降六十元，吉桶生汕九百六十元，小車蔴油七百七十元。豆餅汕帮來納，布勢獨秀、餘記餅六十九元，升四元。</p>

<p>— 本報記者　子健</p>
<p>〔本報香港廿日航訊〕太古公司的盛京輸，十九日由滬抵港，頓時香港的中環海旁，活現了一幅關別多年的「流民圖」，此情此景，宛如香港淪陷時難民候輪離港的紛亂，雜沓和狼狽。不過，這回的「難民」是來港的而不是離港的吧了。香港這個小島，現在又不辭在中國近代史上再三扮演牠作爲一個中國「難民」庇托所的地位。　在盛京輪抵港之前，由滬上富人承包飛港的特班機，已有四五班之多，每天由廣九鐵路帶進來的取道廣州來港逃難的人也在不少，但他們都是有錢的人，個個衣履整齊，荷囊飽滿，香港的人祗把他們當作一般旅行家看待。但盛京輪的來客，則大半露出寒酸相來，充份的表現他們的「難民」本色。</p>
<p>大小旅館宣告客滿</p>
<p>港中的官員這兩天來，正忙於計劃收容「難民」的工作，不過他們收容的對象是一般由華北華中撤退來港的英僑，與黄臉黑睛的中國「難民」無關。因爲港中大小旅館，現在都已宣布客滿，我們腰纏萬貫的大亨，甚至把洋人的旅館也佔去了，爲了錢，旅館老　也不好意思呌這批新來的「高等華人」跑開的。</p>
<p>各業景氣　頂費回漲</p>
<p>金圓劵發行初期香港市面所呈的冷淡，現在已成過去了。據可靠方面估計：本月的兩三週時間內，香港平添了五千至七千人，他們雖不盡是富豪大亨，但至少也是他們的帮閒或先頭部隊和家屬等等。旅館旣爲他們所住滿，洋雜公司，呢絨店，飲食業和娛樂塲所，也因爲他們的到臨而利市三倍，瀰漫景氣。兩月前，已走下坡的新樓頂費，現已回漲。例如銅鑼灣畔的新樓，過去每層頂手費約六千元，現已增至一萬，租金每月三百元，現增至四百元，但仍有求過於供之勢。</p>
<p>元寶五隻　全部沒收</p>
<p>路透社倫敦十七日電訊中說：英下院已注意到「大批中國難民無限制流入」香港的情形，一般因此推測港府爲了應付這個局面，有可能恢復戰前一度實施的移民法便，限制中國人入境。但上述那些高等「難民」，港府也許歡迎之不暇，而其考慮中限制的對象，則屬於盛京輪載來的一類吧。</p>
<p>前天在啓德機塲上，有一位大亨的太太，身上携有金元寳五隻，被香港海關搜去，那些金元寳當然充公，（港例是禁金入口的。）寄語來港的人士，千萬不要携帶黄金，否則，你們白白把錢財送給人家，人家不特不多謝你們，還要把你們送進法庭去！</p>

<h3 id="c111">為助學金事再答讀者 <a href="#c111" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e111" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">111</a></h3>
<p>在上月廿三日，我們曾爲「讀者助學金」事，對讀者有一次總的答復。現在本屆助學工作，已近尾聲，還有很多讀者和申請學生來信查問，所以在這裏再作一次總答復。同時我們要向列各校，表達我們深切的希望，藉爲淸寒學生請命了。</p>
<p>申請本報讀者助學金的學生，經本報初審通過的，原有三百二十九人，包括私立大·專·中·職共九十五校。後來經過獎學金統一審核委員會的複核，只通過了一百卅七人。其餘一百九十二人，因爲他們肄業的學校，始終沒有把免費生名册造報獎學金統審會核對，或者名册雖巳造送，可是免費名額不足，所以該會不予核准·現在對這許多受影響的學生，聞獎學金統審會將移請教育局轉飭各該校予以免費；至於各校是否遵照辦理，我們就無法臆斷了。</p>
<p>未報免費生名册的，有下列十六校：</p>
<p>滬新中學　育年會中學</p>
<p>民治中學　東南中學</p>
<p>孟賢中學　位育中學</p>
<p>大德助產　中國中學</p>
<p>新華中學　民立中學</p>
<p>啓秀女中　聖芳濟中學</p>
<p>正中中學　法學院附中</p>
<p>正中女中　愛國女中</p>
<p>免費不足額的，有下列十九校；</p>
<p>廣澄藥職　江西中學</p>
<p>錫華中學　振德中學</p>
<p>民立女中　協進中學</p>
<p>懷恩中學　大同附中二院</p>
<p>崇實中學　徐匯女中</p>
<p>東南藥職　大同附中一院</p>
<p>越且中學　建承中學</p>
<p>靜文女中　南洋中學</p>
<p>震且附中　曉明女中</p>
<p>粵東中學</p>
<p>按獎學金統審會的定章：凡向任何機關團體申請助學金的學生，必須該生所肄業的學校已經有了依照規定的免費生名額，才能予以核准。這原是旨在防杜學校「慷他人之慨」，可是事實上却影響了淸寒學生的申請權利。我們的讀者助學的對象是淸寒學生，如今因其肄業學校的關係，致未得受助機會，誠令人不無遺憾，我們除了深致歉疚並關切外，希望獎學金統審會的補救辦法，各該學校能够欣然接受。</p>
<p>現在一般人的心理，都以爲上海私立學校有很多是「學店」，其實也不盡然；我們深信上列各校，其辦學的目的，必然是作育英才，主持人皆屬教育界知名之士，其所以免費不足額，或根本未報免費生名册的，此中或另有其困難和原因，可以令人諒解的地方。所以我們敢信，對於獎學金統審會的補救辦法，各該校當局一定能够勉爲其難，而使淸寒學生不致失望的。</p>
<p>此外，還有一點聲明：有很多淸寒學生，原向獎學金統審會申請的，最近經該會核准，商請本報助學金撥付，計有三百七十人，本報以旨在助學，業已欣然同意了。（名單請參看廿二，廿三兩天太欄）</p>
<p>最後，我們對捐款讀者謹致十二萬分的謝意！</p>

<h3 id="c112">「必也正名乎」 <a href="#c112" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e112" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">112</a></h3>
<p>— 雷霆</p>
<p>「正名」，在我國似乎是一般名流學者們牢不可拔的習慣。這當然是深受「名不正則言不順」的影響，而尤其重要的關鍵，則在於「言不順」。</p>
<p>然而名正言順的工作，在目前這無往而不是畸形的社會的國家裏，長否獲致良好的效果呢？這在明眼人的心目中，當然是一個很大的問號！</p>
<p>例如：上自當局的施政大綱，下至一般社團的章則規條，看上去，那一條，那一款，那一項不是頭頭是道，言之成理。不但「言順」，而且更「名正」。然而講到實施，不名存實亡的有多少？</p>
<p>可是一般「正名」家的思想和目的，還是斤斤於「正名」。</p>
<p>又如物價的上漲，稅收的增加，或什麼什麼關於代價的增漲；最簡單的說話，該是漲價。但却有人認爲漲價兩個字太刺激了，太顯露了，大有掀動物價的嫌疑。於是便產生了一個比較緩和的「調整」來調整一下。</p>
<p>這樣一來，漲價兩個頗具有挑撥性的字，便沒有人筆之於書，出之於口了。於是雖然報上盡是個調整的記載，到處都是一片調整的呼聲，而在「正名」家看起來，却泰然地視而不見，聽而不聞，天下似乎眞的太平了。因爲什麼都沒有漲價。</p>
<p>然而最近兩年來，一般小百姓雖沒有受到漲價的刺激，但早受不了調整的賜予，而且更覺得調整似乎比較漲價更可怕了。可是一般「正名」家的思想和目的，還是斤斤於「正名」。</p>
<p>又如最近私立中小學校的教職員們，因爲受不了一切物價的大「調」大「整」，活不下了，於是要求增收×費（因爲官方不准搜用學費或雜費等名稱，而中小學聯誼會又沒有確定名目，不敢擅專，以×代之）官方的表示：一，是對教職員們的淸苦，深表同情；二，市庫支絀，愛莫能助；三，×費可增加，但不得用學費雜費等的名稱，倍數也不能註明；四，徵收數目，由各校當局與學生家長商洽之。</p>
<p>對於一二兩條，袞袞諸公於公務繁忙之中，猶關注到這羣在飢餓棧上掙扎的小教員，我想他們除十二萬分感激之外，當然沒話說。對於第四條担心學生家長們的負祖，尤見當局維持教育與關懷民瘼的苦衷，更使人惑佩無旣。但對於第三條的用意，却不免百思不得其解。</p>
<p>因爲學生是求學的，所以所交的費用該稱學費；學校是教學的所在，所以所收的費用該稱學費；而教師的束修（從古制，尊師也），當局是規定在學費中支付的，所以也是拿的學費。這次增收的費用，旣然是教職員們拿的，不准稱雜費，尤可說是防制不肖學店老　的中飽，猶可說也。至於不准用學費兩字，掉句書包，眞是「仰之彌高」了！</p>
<p>其實尊師金也吧，進修金也吧，甚至稱之曰施捨金也吧。窮教員們的最大目的，只是希望多拿一點賣命錢，來多維持若干天的最低生活，如是而已。在家長方面，管你什麼金，還不是拿點錢出來，如是而已。八兩不是依然半斤。</p>
<p>然而「正名」家還是斤斤于「正名」！</p>
<p>「必也正名乎」？此聖人之道也。</p>
<p>小子不敏，謹承教矣！</p>
<h3 id="c113">論疾惡 <a href="#c113" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e113" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">113</a></h3>
<p>— 吳庸</p>
<p>孟子說：「尊賢使能，俊傑在位，則天下之士，皆悅而願立於其朝矣。」這是當然的事，不在話下的。只是個人以爲孟子這話是對君王說的，不長對「天下之士」說的。故而並不含有叫人養晦韜光之意。孟子並沒有說：士之「立於其朝」，必須以在上者「尊賢使能，俊傑在位」爲必要條件。須知君主若已做到「尊賢使能，俊傑在位」的地步，則士之是否「願立於其朝」已無關重要，不必再予强調。</p>
<p>據孟十說，古之伯夷的個性是：「非其君不事，非其友不友；不立於惡人之朝，不與惡人言；立於惡人之朝，與惡人言，如以朝衣朝冠，坐於塗炭；推惡惡之心，思與鄉人立；其冠不正，望望然去之，若將凂焉。」伯夷這種潔身自好，疾惡如仇的精神，後世莫不敬佩。只是他的「非其友不友，不立於惡人之朝，不與惡人言」等項，我認爲不無過火處。這樣的作風，在消極方面說，與今人之所謂「鴕鳥主義」有些近似。故而孟子的評語是「伯夷隘」。夫人之所以惡，在於少與善人接觸；「惡人之朝」，顧名思義，當是善人不在朝之意。如果善人退居山林，與世無爭，勢必世人將愈惡，世事將愈糟。如此，則善人之「善」於惡人之惡不起作用，世上又何貴乎有善人？故唯世有惡人，善人愈有自致於在朝之列之必要。</p>
<p>伯夷的餓死首陽是値得我們同情的。但此是「不與惡人言，不立於惡人之朝」的必然結果。關於這點，史記魏其武安侯列傳說得最是明白：「……於是乃以魏其侯爲丞相，武安侯爲太尉。籍福賀魏其侯，因弔日：君侯資性喜善疾惡，方今善人譽君侯，故至丞相；然君侯且疾惡，惡人衆，亦且毀君侯；君侯能兼容，則幸久，不能，今以毀去矣。魏其不聽。」魏其侯不但「喜善」，抑且堅決主張「疾惡」，結果是被武安侯排擠，落得一個「棄市」下塲。</p>
<p>這種下塲當然是不甚有趣的。這使我們思考：一人對於「善」與「惡」該採怎樣的立塲？其中的可能性有四。第一是：喜善疾惡；其次是：喜善不疾惡；其次是：喜惡不疾善；再其次是：喜惡疾善。二三兩途的好處是穩便；喜惡疾善，好雖是好，只是他未免趨於極端，容亦有行不通的時候，蓋世間「惡人多」固矣，然程度恐未必有若是之甚也，故與「喜善疾惡」同犯「不合時宜」之嫌。</p>
<p>依個人的想法，喜善疾惡是不妨的；不過「喜善」者是喜人之善，「疾惡」者是疾已之惡。如抱喜人之善疾已之惡的態度週旋於現世，其庶幾乎？</p>
<h3 id="c114">買肉記 <a href="#c114" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e114" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">114</a></h3>
<p>— 尢墨君</p>
<p>早晨聞校內同人紛紛在說買肉吃，心想肉從何來，且想每日喊破嚨喉，絞盡腦汁所得來的區區鐘點費旣只好吃碗陽春麵，那末錢從何來買肉吃，豈非滑稽之事！說句實話，校內全體師生茹素巳久；籮蔔靑菜豆腐湯，天天老是這調調兒。當我們下著之際，雖未嘗不可把「咬得菜根，百事可做」來自慰，無如菜沒油水，有油還可潤腸今則紫性運枯腸已變成「此路不通」，非服硫酸鎂不可了！</p>
<p>肉從何來？原來有位校工吿假返鄉，據說他家裏殺了一只猪，他因帶些猪肉到校中來。價不貴，只消金圓劵十六元一斤，眞不貴！在前兩天，我的確曉得肋條每斤要二十四元，坐臀加二元。有位主婦親吿訴我，她到了小菜塲，在一家肉店中瞧到一塊肋條，臕水著實不錯，一秤之下，算算價錢要金圓券二十七元，她摸摸身邊只帶得十五大元，在萬分失望的心情之餘，只好對那肋條行了一個注目禮而別，如今每斤肉只消十六元，比前兩日價差不多要便宜三分之一，不吃豈非可惜？於是大家提議「吃公司」，總算開了一次葷。</p>
<p>日前接得老友姜丹書翁來函，信中有「我校每晚必『饘粥之食』，其實並未　什麼喪事」之語，言謔而悲，不知他讀了這文後，心中又要起什麼感想了。</p>

<p>淸末民初間，吳中名士輩出，遺聞軼事，堪賢談助者，當推吳鈍齋先生。先生諱郁生，字蔚若，號鈍齋，丁丑翰林，服官以貞潔稱，翁同龢推崇備至，日記上屢稱吳太史者卽是。當髻齡時，乃父因渠李子，携寓家祠，課讀最嚴，使勿稍放逸。年甫冠，登賢書，連捷成進士，廿四歲登詞苑，歷充粵鄂閩等省主考官，與沈曾植（寐叟）同任廣東主考，南海康有爲，榜名祖貽，卽出其門下，歷數十年師事敬禮之勿衰。戊戍政變，先生放四川學政，吳下如張一　昆仲，均羅致入幕，更以公子輩師事之。洎後張膺經濟特科，亦係先生轉約沈淇泉太姻丈保舉，其識拔天下士，尤具隻眼，淸季歷官吏部左侍郎，入軍機，洊署郵傳部尙書，以循吏名臣稱。一時舊交通茶如梁士詒關賡麟業恭綽等均係年世交，爲門下士。</p>

<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 25th] Chief of Staff Gu Zhutong flew by special plane from Nanjing to Bengbu on the morning of the 25th to command the Xuzhou-Bengbu Campaign. At noon, he convened an important military conference in Bengbu with Li Yannian and others to discuss deployments to secure the southern section of the Jinpu Railway. It is said that Mr. Gu will stay in Bengbu for several days.</p>
<p>[Our Bengbu Dispatch, 25th] Gu Zhutong flew to Bengbu on the morning of the 25th and convened a meeting of senior generals in the official residence of Xia Wei, Chairman of Anhui Province, giving instructions on the deployment of the southern section of the Jinpu Railway.</p>
<p>[Our Bengbu Dispatch, 25th] As the focus of the Xuzhou Campaign shifts southward, fierce battles are taking place in the Lingbi area of northern Anhui. A bandit force attacked the county seat of Lingbi. In the past two days, they have been severely attacked by a certain defending unit, with heavy bandit casualties.</p>
<p>[Our Bengbu Dispatch, 25th] The situation on the southern section of the Jinpu Railway is developing. The northward troops are still stalled near Xisipo. The battle for Lingbi remains intense.

<p>Rumors of Recruiting Famous Scholars to Join the Cabinet are Untrue</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 25th] Deputy Minister of the Central Propaganda Department Tao Xisheng flew back to Nanjing from Beiping at 1:30 p.m. on the 25th and was received by the President in the afternoon, reporting on his trip to the north and the situation there. In the evening, he told reporters that the situation in Beiping and Tianjin was very stable. Mr. Tao said that General Fu Zuoyi had gained the deep trust of the general public in Beiping and Tianjin. Under Fu's command and deployment, the situation in North China was good due to the stability of the people's hearts. Mr. Tao's time in Beiping was very brief, so he only met with some people in the education and cultural circles. As for the rumors that he was recruiting famous scholars for the government to join the cabinet, Mr. Tao said that this was not the case. (Yesterday's Beiping dispatch mistakenly stated that "Secretary-General of the Central Political Council" was Tao Xisheng. It should have been "Deputy Minister of the Central Propaganda Department.")</p>

<p>[This Bureau, Nanjing, 25th] President met with General Tang Shengzhi, who had just arrived in Nanjing from Hunan, at his residence on Huangpu Road at 4:30 p.m. on the 25th. Tang provided the President with his opinions on the current situation.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 25th] Hunan representatives in the Legislative and Supervisory Yuan, the National Assembly, and people from Hunan residing in Nanjing held a tea party at Jieshou Hall at 3 p.m. on the 25th to welcome General Tang Shengzhi. Over a hundred people attended, including Zhang Mojun, Huang Shaogu, Zhang Zhen, Liu Keshu, Tang Honglie, and Zhu Yishan. Chairman Zeng Xiaocen gave a welcoming speech, praising Tang's contributions since the Northern Expedition. Tang then delivered a speech, saying that Hunanese people had made great contributions to the country and the nation for over a hundred years, but he himself had participated in the Xinhai Revolution, the Northern Expedition, and the War of Resistance, and was still in the same state as now, which he felt ashamed of. He said that the current situation of suppressing the rebellion was a long-term struggle that could not be completed in a day or two or a month or two. Everyone should fulfill their responsibilities and contribute their strength. He said that he had not come here to seek any office or position, otherwise, he would be letting down the people of Hunan. However, if the President ordered him to take on a task within his ability and he refused, he would also be letting down the people of Hunan. Tang also said that he had only come to provide some advice to the President and some old friends, to tell them about the situation among the people, in order to fulfill his personal responsibility, and that he had no other requests.</p>

<h3 id="e13">US Leaders Discuss Aid to China: Statement to be Issued Upon Decision; Secretary Marshall's Style is Consistent: Taciturn; President Truman Expresses Great Sympathy for Ambassador Koo's Appeal for Assistance <a href="#e13" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c13" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">13</a></h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 24th] Truman, Marshall, and senior U.S. defense officials have been discussing since the 22nd whether it is possible to provide more assistance to the Chinese government, which is currently in distress. It was learned here tonight that the meeting of these senior officials to discuss the China issue has not yet ended. As soon as they reach a final decision, the United States will issue a formal statement on its policy toward China. Marshall met with Truman for 25 minutes today, and it is generally believed that their conversation concerned the China issue. However, Marshall maintained his consistent style and remained silent on the matter. The National Security Council, which is responsible for formulating U.S. defense strategy and foreign policy, also held an important meeting at the White House last night, but the content of the meeting is unknown. What actions the United States will take to aid the Chinese government in the future is a matter of great concern and speculation. Both the extreme factions advocating full-scale aid to China and those advocating a hands-off approach have a large number of supporters and are arguing endlessly, but the attitude of U.S. government officials remains secret.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 24th] When Marshall met with reporters on the afternoon of the 24th, he made a brief verbal statement on the situation in China, but did not explain what policy the United States would adopt in the current crisis, nor did he specifically mention what kind of assistance would be given to the Chinese government. When Marshall began to discuss the situation in China, he emphasized that one of the major problems facing the United States was what appropriate measures the United States could take in the current crisis to truly help overcome the difficulties. Marshall continued, saying that when considering this matter, it must be clearly remembered under what conditions the United States could take action, which was related to the actions of Congress. He also specifically mentioned the question of whether there were available resources and materials, and the question of the United States getting involved in the Chinese vortex. He declared that this was a very difficult problem that needed to be carefully considered. Marshall then reviewed the $400 million military and economic aid plan for China passed in April, saying that a considerable amount of the $125 million military grant consisted of airplanes, gasoline, and other military supplies, most of which were equipment. Referring to the problem of available supplies and materials in the United States, he said, "We are making every effort to expedite action, using naval vessels and merchant ships to transport materials to China." At this point, Marshall suddenly ended his remarks on China, saying, "I have said all I intend to say this afternoon about the situation in China." At today's press conference, which was attended by an unprecedented number of reporters, the Chinese crisis was the issue of greatest concern to the audience, but reporters still did not learn any specific expressions of U.S. attitude from Marshall. When reporters asked Marshall whether the China issue could be clarified in the next few days, he replied that he did not intend to comment on it. One reporter, dissatisfied with Marshall's reserved attitude, asked him, "Does the United States have no policy toward China?" Marshall replied, "No comment." Another reporter asked Marshall whether the State Department would recommend to the next Congress that aid to China be increased, and Marshall gave the same empty reply. Marshall seemed extremely unwilling to discuss the situation in China today. It is evident that since Monday, Marshall, Truman, and other government officials have not reached any clear conclusions in their discussions on the situation in China. Before a final decision is made, neither the White House nor the State Department intends to issue any formal statement.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 24th] Our Ambassador to the United States, Koo Vi Kyuin, continued today to ask President Truman to immediately provide our country with more material and moral support as we engage in a war to resist communism. After meeting with President Truman, the Ambassador told reporters that he was extremely excited after his meeting with the President, and that the President expressed "great sympathy" for our country. However, when reporters asked why he was so excited, the Ambassador did not explain. Koo said that in his meeting with the President, he had emphasized the urgent need for aid to China. When reporters asked whether he had discussed the issue of the United States sending a military delegation to China, the Ambassador reiterated that he had emphasized the urgency of our country's needs, the seriousness of the situation, and its impact on the general justice of freedom and democracy. When reporters asked what assurances he had received from the President, he said, "You should ask the President to explain." When reporters further asked whether our country was still seeking moral support while waiting for the United States to clarify its statement on its policy toward China, the Ambassador said, "That is naturally the case." It is learned that Koo had frankly discussed with the President various possibilities for aiding our country, and had put forward "concrete suggestions regarding our country's immediate need for American aid in both material and moral terms." He also requested to schedule a meeting with Marshall, but no decision was made.</p>

<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 24th] Moscow today conducted anti-U.S. aid to China propaganda on its English-language broadcasts to the U.S., accusing Bullitt, who advocates aid to China, of being an open war instigator, and hoping to hinder Truman and Marshall's meeting to formulate a clear policy toward China.</p>
<p>[This Bureau News] Bullitt visited Yu Hongjun, President of the Central Bank, at the bank at 11:30 a.m. yesterday and left after a while. The content of the conversation is unknown. However, because Yu is also the Vice Chairman of the Executive Yuan's U.S. Aid Utilization Committee, it is widely believed that the conversation was related to the utilization of U.S. aid.</p>

<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 25th] In order to adapt to the linked import and export measures, the Ministry of Finance is currently revising the import and export trade measures and their appendices, as well as the Central Bank's foreign exchange management regulations. Finance Minister Xu Kan convened a meeting of representatives from the Ministry of Industry and Commerce and the Central Bank on the 24th to discuss the principles of revision. Xu Kan has also designated Zhang Fuyun, Director of Customs, Zhu Xie, Deputy Director, Wu Xingzhou, Director of the Currency Department, Cheng Dacheng, Counselor, and Wang Zishuang, Deputy Director of the Central Bank's Business Bureau, to be responsible for studying and revising the measures.</p>
<p>[Our Guangzhou Dispatch, 25th] According to relevant sources, an Economic Coordination Committee will be established in Guangzhou to promote the economic construction of South China and to coordinate with the wartime economic system. The committee will be chaired by Huo Baoshu. Regarding the linked import and export system, it began to be implemented here on the 24th. Only two companies completed foreign exchange settlement procedures in accordance with the new method that day. The reason is that various factories are not fully aware of the procedures and are still taking a wait-and-see attitude.</p>
<p>[This City News] According to Zheguan Zengxi: From the 15th to the 20th of this month, import applications for foreign orders for which payment has already been made have had a total of US$219,408.11 in permits issued.

<p>[United Press, Pittsburgh, 24th] According to Arthur, vice president of the U.S. 14th Air Force Association on the 24th, the movement to reorganize General Chennault's "Flying Tigers" is already underway informally, and is recruiting "thousands" of volunteers to go to China. This plan has already been endorsed by President Chiang, but cannot be realized until the U.S. government agrees. Before the U.S. government agrees, the association is recruiting volunteers from all over the U.S. Arthur, formerly a lieutenant colonel in the 14th Air Force, is now in charge of this movement. General Chennault has informed Arthur that he is willing to come out of retirement to lead the "Flying Tigers". Arthur also said that thousands of volunteers are willing to return to work. The organization has at least 200 pilots and 1,800 ground personnel. After training in the United States, this organization will be transferred to Taiwan for training and then go to China to fight. They will fly P-51 fighter jets and A-26 light bombers.</p>

<p>[Central News Agency, Taipei, 25th] The Provincial Government announced that the exchange rate for the fiat currency will be adjusted from 600 to 1 to 370 Taiwan dollars per unit of gold yuan, effective from the 26th. When the central government reformed the currency system, the exchange rate between the Taiwan dollar and the gold yuan was initially set at 1,835 to 1. Subsequently, the central government promulgated supplementary measures for financial and economic reform, which changed the gold yuan to U.S. dollar ratio from 4 to 1 to 20 to 1. Therefore, the Taiwan Provincial Government finally adjusted the Taiwan dollar to gold yuan exchange rate in accordance with this ratio, changing it to 370 to 1, effectively increasing the value of the Taiwan dollar fivefold compared to its original value. The Taiwan Provincial Government also announced on the 25th that it would readjust the salaries of public servants in Taiwan Province starting this month. At the same time, it was stipulated that all travelers coming to Taiwan to remit money to other regions must present identification and a boat or plane ticket, with a limit of 6 million Taiwan dollars per person.

<h3 id="e25">My Humble Opinion on the Revised Emergency Financial and Economic Measures <a href="#e25" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c25" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">25</a></h3>
<p>— Ping Lun</p>
<p>The author is a domestic authoritative economist who has a thorough understanding of the revised measures for issuing the gold yuan and the revised measures for handling gold, silver, and foreign currency owned by the people, but is unwilling to disclose their name. Our newspaper values their arguments and is introducing them here. - Editor's Note.</p>
<p>Since the government announced the revised measures for issuing the gold yuan and the revised measures for handling gold, silver, and foreign currency owned by the people on the 12th of this month, the government's economic policy has developed in the opposite direction to the August 19th policy. The legal gold content of the gold yuan has fallen from 0.22217 grams of pure gold to 4.4434 milligrams, the exchange rate of four to one for the U.S. dollar has become a conditional twenty to one, and the possession of gold, silver, and silver coins has gone from being prohibited to being permitted, with conditional redemption. In less than three months, the government's policy has changed to the opposite extreme, and many people must be shocked by the government's rashness and condemn its lack of credibility. A closer analysis reveals that this change is inevitable, and the government's courageous change of policy can be described as deeply appropriate and extremely wise. The August 19th Emergency Economic Measures attempted to solve economic problems with purely political means, and it seems that considerations were not thorough enough. Regarding this point, the author cannot help but feel deeply moved.</p>
<p>Since the accelerated depreciation of the legal currency in 1946, speculation in gold and U.S. dollars on the market has intensified, and social opinion and some short-sighted people have often called for the nationalization of gold. The author once participated in the work of a central design agency as an expert and saw many plans for the nationalization of gold. In addition, the competent department also had this immature plan, and in the summer of 1946, the financial authorities sought the author's opinion on this plan. At that time, the author raised two counterarguments: (1) How to nationalize? Nationalization is not about seizing from the people, but about purchasing from the people at a certain price. One side purchases gold, and the other side releases currency. If that is the case, then how is it different from an expansionary policy using Open Market Operation in the open market? Now that prices are soaring, it is appropriate to contract, so how can an expansionary policy be adopted? The central bank's policy of selling gold should be regarded as a short-term means of dealing with emergencies and is not wrong. The questionable point is that it excessively suppressed the price of gold and foreign exchange, causing the country to lose gold reserves too quickly. If we now reverse course and purchase gold for nationalization in one fell swoop, funds will flood the market, and prices will soar. How can we deal with the aftermath? (2) Gold is a means of savings for the general public. The policy of the former kings was to regulate the people's property, so that they could afford to support their parents and raise their children. Today, the government has no time for this, and no one complains. If even the only means of saving is prohibited, the consequences are truly unimaginable. Consider that the people's hard-earned money has no means of saving, and the depreciation of currency cannot be prevented. Who will not protect their own interests? As a result, there is only the path of waste and hoarding of materials, which is ten thousand times more serious than speculation in gold and foreign currency. Moreover, the people's habits of thousands of years cannot be reversed in a day. Forcing it will inevitably lead to disturbances. India changed to a gold exchange standard policy and stopped using hard currency ten years before China adopted a legal currency policy. Even now, the abundance of gold hidden in the private sector is still the first in the world, and its intake and output of gold and silver affect the world's gold and silver markets. However, the government still never dares to risk the anger of the people to prohibit it. What day is today? How can we invite trouble upon ourselves? At that time, the author also advocated opening the securities market to increase the people's means of saving. It was also said that those who advocate the nationalization of gold today are merely aware that gold speculation is too rampant and contributes to the expansion of credit, and they want to eradicate it. However, they do not know that gold speculation is a natural result of currency depreciation. The government cannot avoid responsibility for currency depreciation, so why should it simply condemn the people's speculation? The financial authorities should find ways to reduce the deficit, contract the currency, stabilize the currency value, and stop the source of gold speculation. They should not worry about the people holding gold. At that time, the financial authorities adopted the author's opinion, so that the panic that occurred a month ago did not occur two years ago, which was fortunate. If we compare the author's arguments at that time with the facts after August 19th of this year, then Finance Minister Xu's proposed amendments to the government are truly timely and appropriate and will be of great help in stabilizing people's hearts and the economy.</p>
<p>Another questionable point after August 19th was the strict use of price controls. The social and economic situation is constantly changing. Even under the condition that the currency state remains unchanged, relative prices still adapt to the state of supply and demand, and change from time to time. The usual academic policy of stabilizing prices refers to stabilizing the price level, not limiting individual prices. A week before August 19th of this year, a certain senior official inquired about controlling prices and controlling the economy. The author strongly stated that it was impossible, saying that without controlling production and supply, simply rigidly controlling the economy and prices would inevitably lead to disaster. China's production units are as numerous as atoms, and the intentions and motivations of production and consumption cannot be controlled by government decrees. If a certain senior official recalls the author's past remarks, they should also feel deeply moved. Those who advocate control often flaunt the control policies of the United Kingdom and other Western countries, but do not deeply consider that even if the control of other countries is successful, it must follow economic principles, otherwise it will inevitably lead to failure. The control of various countries, in principle, increases the profits of special industries, changes the relative status of various industries, and helps the movement of production elements to conform to the government's plan. Has the controller of China ever considered these principles? How can China's objective conditions be widely applied to this kind of plan? To cite Western examples: Before the Great Depression (1929-1933), the intervention policy of the U.S. Federal Farm Board and the Egyptian government's intervention in the cotton market both failed because they ignored economic principles. As a result, the government lost funds, and the normal activities of the market were rigidified, but the seriousness was far less than that of China this time. The United Kingdom does indeed implement comprehensive rationing, but industrialists and businessmen can still export. When the author was in England in the winter of 1946, they examined that British exports had recovered to 97% of the pre-war level, and they planned to increase exports to 170% of the pre-war level in 1948. It is definitely not like China after August 19th, which blocked the source of all profits, making the economic function completely rigid. Speaking of this point, the government seems not to have accepted the opinions of experts. The August 19th Emergency Decree was deeply evasive in advance. According to what the author learned afterwards, many senior government officials did not sympathize with it, and one or two of the people who were ordered to implement it did so with painful and contradictory feelings. Only the "laymen" who had the power to decide were particularly enthusiastic. In the past, during the War of Resistance Against Japan, control and price limits were tested many times and suffered ruthless failures. They were also not worthy of serving as a lesson. Now that price limits have been lifted, the free market has been restored, and the two revisions have been announced, the government's policy has returned to a reasonable path. We can't undo the past, and complaining is useless. Only under the new policy can the whole country unite and cooperate to overcome the current difficulties. After starving millions of people, Lenin's military communism bravely corrected its mistakes and was able to consolidate its regime. We absolutely don't need to be pessimistic.</p>
<p>Secondly, the author also wishes to express a few opinions on the revised measures themselves: (1) The ratio of the gold yuan to gold has changed from 200 to 1,000, the ratio to silver dollars has changed from 2 to 10, and the ratio to U.S. dollars has changed from 4 to 20. All of this is subject to the condition of an equal amount of deposit before it can be exchanged. Some people may accuse the government of breaking its promise and seizing most of the wealth of law-abiding people. This fact is undeniable. However, we must think from a broader perspective. At this time, the government has an obligation and necessity to stabilize the value of the gold yuan. After decades of war in China, the wealth of society and the country is very limited, and productivity has not recovered. Any expert who comes to power can only find the natural level of currency value based on the country's existing wealth. If the value of the gold yuan is overestimated too much, the country will not be able to fully fulfill its promise of redemption, and the gold yuan will not be stable at all. Consider the socio-economic situation a month ago, which was almost destroyed, which is chilling. At this time and place, what the government should strive for and be able to strive for is not the issue of fairness to each individual, but how to obtain a stable currency value, a stable economy, so that production will increase in the future, and everyone will benefit. If we are determined to haggle over the issue of fairness to each individual, then the overall problem will still not be solved, which will not help anything. People who have suffered losses in the past by abiding by the law will be able to feel at ease and free from resentment if they think of this point. (Continued on page 4)</p>

<h3 id="e35">Taiwan Salt Has Slow Sales; Only Temporary Difficulties; Exchange and Transportation Problems Being Resolved <a href="#e35" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c35" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">35</a></h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 25th] Ministry of Finance: Taiwan Salt's planned production quota for this year is 4.4 million units, accounting for 7.8% of the national total production of 56.638 million dan. By October, the actual production in the area was more than 6.964 million dan, which is 92.43% over the planned production (the production from January to October was more than 3.619 million dan). A total of more than 770,000 units have been shipped to Hunan, Hubei, Jiangxi, and Anhui. There are currently 1.45 million dan of salt that have been allocated to Hunan and Hubei for shipment. However, due to frequent military transportation, the lack of transportation tools, and the suspension of exchange between Taiwan and Shanghai, funds cannot be allocated, which has had a considerable impact for a while. The Ministry of Finance has telegraphed the Ministry of National Defense and the Taiwan Provincial Government, instructing the military agencies to exempt salt transportation tools from detention and transfer the Taiwan Provincial Bank to open exchange in order to facilitate the transportation of Taiwan salt. In addition, the export of salt from the area to Japan was originally handled by the China Trust Bureau. This year, 22,450 tons have been shipped out, totaling 449,000 dan. About 17,000 tons, totaling 340,000 dan, can be shipped soon. Recently, the Salt Administration sent personnel to Japan to directly negotiate with the Allied Headquarters. The original plan was to export a total of 500,000 tons in the coming year, with Changlu and Taiwan salt fields accounting for half each, namely 250,000 tons each. All related matters have been largely agreed upon. Once the issue of the China Trust Bureau's old debt to the Allied Headquarters is resolved, a contract can be signed and shipments can begin. Based on the above situation, the slow sales of Taiwan salt are originally due to temporary difficulties in exchange and transportation. Once these are resolved, there will be no need to worry about stockpiling.</p>

<h3 id="e47">France Approved to Participate in Ruhr Control, Equal Rights with Britain and the United States, Sovereignty Returned to Germany, Anglo-American Policy Unchanged <a href="#e47" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c47" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">47</a></h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, London, 25th] According to sources from the British Foreign Office: France's permission to participate in the Ruhr Control Committee has been reviewed by Britain and the United States at a meeting in Paris on the 19th between Marshall, McNeil, and Schuman. The original intention of Britain and the United States was to invite France to participate only after the merger of the three occupation zones in Germany. Therefore, the current action of Britain and the United States in allowing France to participate without waiting for the merger of the three zones is generally regarded as a concession by Britain and the United States to France.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, London, 25th] The British Foreign Office announced today: Britain and the United States have agreed to allow France to have full participation in the institutions for inspecting and controlling Ruhr coal and steel, in other words, France's rights in this institution will be completely equal to those of Britain and the United States.</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 24th] Secretary of State Marshall told reporters today that the United States and Britain intend to return the Ruhr area's coal and steel industries to German management, regardless of France's opposition. At the same time, the US government is also prepared to continue taking various measures to prevent the revival of German militarism. The occupying forces will continue to be stationed in Germany, so there should be no problem with the security of the Ruhr area. I have invited France to join the Anglo-American Coal and Steel Committee to help review various security measures. The final security measures will be stipulated in the peace treaty with Germany. A security committee will be established soon to continue inspecting German industry. The American people deeply sympathize with the French people's concern that their peace and freedom may be threatened, but the reorganization of the Ruhr area's industry is urgently needed to aid West Germany and Europe as a whole. In order to expand production, returning it to German management is crucial.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Moscow, 25th] Moscow dispatches and comments on the Ruhr issue, stating: France has now proven to have fallen to a secondary status, and the opinions of that country are not valued by Britain and the United States. Not only that, but in the political performance of Britain and the United States, the manipulation of everything and the high-pressure tactics of the United States have become increasingly obvious. It also stated: The 75th law promulgated by General Clay, Commander of the US Forces in Germany, and General Robertson, Commander of the British Forces, handing over the Ruhr to private capital management, is the final surrender of Britain to the United States. The previous position of Britain was to strongly advocate that the Ruhr industry must be socialized. The complete victory of the American view of restoring German private monopolies is closely related to American monopoly capitalists.</p>
<h3 id="e48">Evatt Attempts to Enlist Four-Power Conference, Rumored Stalin Expresses Agreement, Neutral Countries Urgently Appeal to the Four Powers, Do Not Worsen the Situation in Berlin During the Mediation Period <a href="#e48" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c48" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">48</a></h3>
<p>[United Press, Paris, 24th] It is reported that UN General Assembly President Evatt has received replies from the heads of the four powers to his confidential telegram seeking a resolution to the Berlin crisis. It is believed that Evatt may have suggested a meeting between Truman, Stalin, and other leaders of the four powers. According to reliable sources, Stalin is one of those who have already replied, and there are signs here and in Moscow that the Soviet Union may welcome such a meeting. It is rumored that Evatt hopes that Truman, after being elected, may also express some decisive attitude, not only to resolve the Berlin dispute but also to resolve the general disputes between East and West.</p>
<p>Previously, Evatt and UN Secretary-General Lie jointly appealed to the four powers on the 13th for an immediate meeting to end the Berlin crisis, but the Western powers refused the request. Later, Evatt wanted Lie to join him in sending a telegram to Truman and Stalin, but Lie felt that he was an international official and could not proceed to such an extent. Therefore, Evatt issued the telegram alone. It is believed that Evatt is now studying the possibility of further actions, some of which are based on his confidential telegram. The importance of Evatt's secret telegram is increasing as the attempt to resolve the Berlin crisis through mediation by the Security Council appears to be failing.</p>
<p>[United Press, Paris, 24th] Reliable sources claim that Argentine Foreign Minister Bramuglia, the Security Council's President for the month, has decided to personally make an urgent appeal to the four powers not to exacerbate the tense situation in Berlin during the mediation period. Bramuglia plans to first present this appeal in person to Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Vyshinsky tonight, and then to the representatives of the United States, Britain, and France tomorrow. Bramuglia is also scheduled to hold another meeting with the other five neutral countries tomorrow to study the four powers' replies to the Berlin currency issue in order to find clues for a basis for mediation.</p>

<p>[United Press, London, 24th] Absolutely reliable sources vehemently denied on the 24th rumors that King George VI of England would abdicate to Crown Princess Elizabeth due to poor health. They said: The King has absolutely no intention of abdicating. According to a long article published by the "Daily Mail" on the 24th, the King is currently suffering from "Buerger's disease"—a vascular occlusive disease discovered by Buerger in 1908. In this disease, the arteries in both legs or one leg become inflamed, gradually closing the blood vessels, so that nutrients cannot reach the lower limbs. Sufferers of this disease are mostly middle-aged, and King George is indeed middle-aged—53 years old. The Paris "Echo Report" published news that the King may abdicate and bequeath the throne to Princess Elizabeth. However, according to absolutely reliable sources close to the royal family: "There is absolutely no basis for the news of the King's abdication. This matter has never been considered and will not be considered, even if the King's health deteriorates, there is no need to consider this matter."</p>

<p>New Cabinet Can Be Formed Within the Week</p>
<p>[United Press, Bangkok, 25th] Fifteen of the 25 cabinet members resigned today. This is the result of parliament's demand for the purging of corrupt officials and the reorganization of the government to make it more capable. Prime Minister Phibunsongkhram himself is also considering whether to resign. Observers believe that Phibunsongkhram may not resign if he can form a strong government. A new cabinet can be formed within the next week. Important ministers such as the Minister of the Interior, Foreign Affairs, and Finance will remain in office, but the three Ministers of the Army, Navy, and Air Force have resigned together.</p>
<h3 id="e53">French Cabinet Gains Confidence of Parliament, Monnerville Likely to be Elected President of Senate <a href="#e53" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c53" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">53</a></h3>
<p>[United Press, Paris, 24th] Prime Minister Queuille gained three votes of confidence in the National Assembly today, but whether this can represent the true strength of the cabinet's position remains a question.</p>
<p>[United Press, Paris, 25th] Riding on the momentum of gaining a vote of confidence from the National Assembly on the 24th, the French coalition cabinet led by Prime Minister Queuille took a further step on the afternoon of the 25th, planning to consolidate its position in parliament. When the Senate elects its president, the moderates can secure victory. The post of president seems to belong to Monnerville, who, like Queuille, belongs to the Radical Socialist Party.</p>
<p>So far, Monnerville is the only candidate who has been nominated. The Gaullists seem to have only obtained sporadic positions in the Senate. On the evening of the 24th, 12 senators from the Liberal Republican Party, 38 from the Independents, and 15 from the Farmers' Party formed a new party, becoming the second-largest party in the Senate. The Gaullist French People's Rally sharply fell to fourth place. The positions of Vice-President of the Senate and secretaries of various groups are allocated according to the strength of the parties, so the Gaullist position is not very high. Although, amid the left-wing offensive, Queuille's center-right government has encountered a new labor strike. Eighty percent of the members of the French department store union voted to strike next week, and the final decision rests with the joint meeting of the Communist General Confederation of Labor and the centrist Christian Confederation of Labor on the 25th. If the strike is approved, Parisian children will have no toys for Christmas this year. With the labor movement demanding step by step, whether Queuille can unite the Socialist, People's Republican, and Radical parties to maintain the coalition government remains to be seen. Political figures say that Queuille believes that wages must be maintained at the current level in order to balance the budget for the coming year.</p>

<p>[United Press, Capital of Venezuela, 24th] The army launched a revolution today, overthrowing the government without firing a shot, and announced that it has control of the entire country. Army Chief of Staff Jiménez said that the army launched the revolution because the government led by President Gallegos was incompetent and because extremist elements among the workers attempted to launch a general strike to support the president. Gallegos was elected president only in February of this year and is currently under house arrest at his residence.</p>
<p>[United Press, Capital of Venezuela, 25th] An official announcement: Defense Minister Chalbaud has been elected president of the military government, pending the establishment of a new government. Army Chief of Staff Jiménez and Deputy Chief of Staff Páez will serve as members of the military government.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 25th] A senior official of our country's delegation to Japan told a reporter from the Central News Agency today that he was deeply dissatisfied with the fact that Allied representatives were not allowed to observe the executions. He pointed out that during the Nuremberg war crimes trials, the four powers participating in the trials had jointly organized a joint execution committee composed of officers. He further believed that it was absolutely necessary for Chinese representatives to be present at the executions, as at least four of the seven war criminals being hanged were convicted primarily for their aggression against China.</p>
<h3 id="e56">Regulations on Secret Execution of Tojo and Others, Our Delegation Expresses Dissatisfaction, Allied Reporters in Tokyo Demand to Observe Hangings <a href="#e56" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c56" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">56</a></h3>
<p>[United Press, Tokyo, 25th] The US Eighth Army Public Relations Office announced today that the seven Japanese Class A war criminals sentenced to be hanged, including Hideki Tojo, will enjoy turkey and other items on Thanksgiving, just like the US troops stationed in Japan. According to Colonel Elguer of the General Headquarters Public Relations Office, the prisoners will be executed in approximately two batches, the first batch of four and the second batch of three. This is because the facilities in the prison can only execute four people at a time.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 24th, United Press] US Army Brigadier General Walker announced on the 18th that Tojo and six other Japanese Class A war criminals would be hanged on a secret date, which has aroused formal protests from the Tokyo Reporters Association. The association is composed of reporters from various Allied newspapers, radio stations, and magazines. They have formally requested General MacArthur's headquarters to allow representatives from the press of each country to participate in the executions, following the precedent of national representation. Given the current situation, the initial external report on the executions will be issued officially. The Reporters Association requests that all reporters be allowed to participate, or at least one reporter be allowed to participate due to limited space and a joint message be issued.</p>
<p>[United Press, Tokyo, 25th] MacArthur's press officer, Elguer, said that "the latest speculation" is that Tojo and others will be hanged next Saturday inside Sugamo Prison in Tokyo. He denied reports that the Far Eastern Commission in Washington had ordered MacArthur to carry out the executions in secret.</p>

<p>[New Asia News Agency, Tokyo, 25th] Joseph B. Keenan, the chief prosecutor of the Tokyo Military Tribunal, visited the Japanese Imperial Palace on the 24th for lunch with the Japanese Emperor. Keenan returned to the court at 2 p.m. He refused to say a word about the meeting with the Japanese Emperor, but he stated that he would return to the United States within the week. According to the Japanese press, the Japanese Emperor's dinner invitation to Keenan had no special significance, as Keenan had issued a statement that the Japanese Emperor could not be tried as a war criminal, so the Japanese Emperor personally hosted a dinner to express his gratitude.</p>
<h3 id="e58">Struggle Between Japanese Government and Opposition Parties Becomes Increasingly Fierce, Possible Dissolution of Parliament Due to Head-on Clash <a href="#e58" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c58" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">58</a></h3>
<p>[New Asia News Agency, Tokyo, 25th] The Japanese opposition parties have officially clashed with the government. At 4 p.m. on the 25th, representatives from the Socialist Party Asanuma, the Democratic Party Komeda, and the National Cooperative Party Takeyama visited Yoshida, Ozawa Mori, and Sato of the House of Representatives, as well as Hirokawa, the secretary-general of the Liberal Party, and handed over a joint statement from the right wing of the opposition parties, demanding the prompt submission of a supplementary budget. Prime Minister Yoshida replied, "There are still difficulties in submitting the budget." After the meeting, representatives from the opposition parties held another meeting in a separate room, deciding to continue demanding that the government submit the budget quickly, while also discussing how to unify the opposition front. It is reported that the government and the Liberal Party have responded to the joint statement from the opposition parties through statements issued by Chief Cabinet Secretary Sato and party secretary-general Hirokawa, stating that it is inappropriate for the opposition parties to use the supplementary budget as an excuse to delay discussions on amending the Civil Service Law. The budget must be completed before it can be submitted, and there is no need to discuss the two together, while the opposition parties have a moral responsibility to discuss the amendment to the Civil Service Law as soon as possible.</p>
<p>[New Asia News Agency, Tokyo, 25th] The deadlock in the Japanese Diet not only shows no signs of breaking, but the struggle between the ruling and opposition parties is intensifying. The Socialist Party, the major party holding a leading role in the opposition, held a secret general meeting of its members on the evening of the 24th to discuss future action plans. It is reported that they insisted that the amendment to the Civil Service Law must be passed according to the Socialist Party's draft, otherwise they would vote against it, even if it led to the dissolution of the Diet. The issue of dissolution will be entirely handled by the party's Central Executive Committee. The Democratic Party also held a leadership meeting yesterday, studying in detail the Socialist Party's plan for dissolving the Diet that had been submitted to the party. The party resolved to firmly oppose the government submitting the supplementary budget to an emergency meeting of the House of Councillors for approval.</p>

<p>[United Press, Washington, 24th] President Truman addressed 500 delegates from 57 countries attending the fourth session of the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization on the 24th. In a moderate tone, he invited the Soviet Union to join the grand alliance against hunger and said: "Cooperation among major countries in food production may make other points of contention easier to resolve." The President said: "Hunger has no nationality," and hoped that all countries could participate in the Food and Agriculture Organization. Truman raised a special issue of global cooperation in the food problem, asking the representatives to try again to negotiate an international wheat agreement. He said: "I deeply regret the failure of this agreement." He continued: "I guarantee that if another wheat agreement can be negotiated, I will definitely submit it to the US Congress next January for approval."</p>

<p>[United Press, Moscow, 24th] A Soviet paleontological excavation team led by Professor Yefremov discovered an unprecedentedly huge dinosaur tomb on the 23rd at the site of an ancient river in the Gobi Desert.

<h3 id="e62">Anglo-American Views Approaching on Resolving Palestine Dispute, Soviet Union Insists All Foreign Troops Should Withdraw Completely from Holy Land <a href="#e62" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c62" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">62</a></h3>
<p>[United Press, Paris, 25th] Soviet representative Tsarapkin submitted a motion to the UN Political Committee on the 25th, advocating that all Arab armies and other foreign military personnel withdraw completely from Palestine. The Soviet proposal not only applies to the Arab armies that entered the Holy Land after May 15, but also includes the hundreds of British, American, French, and Belgian military observers sent to Palestine by the United Nations to oversee the UN ceasefire order. At the same time, the Soviet Union will also demand that the Security Council take appropriate action to prevent military action from reoccurring in Palestine. Britain originally fully adopted the Bernadotte Plan, but submitted a new proposal on the 25th that was milder than the previous one. Because the United States opposed the original British proposal and offered opinions, the new British proposal includes many suggestions from the United States, so that the two countries can have closer views and thoroughly resolve the Palestine issue. However, the new proposal still differs from the US position on one key point: whether the future borders between the Arabs and Israelis should be rigidly stipulated by the United Nations, or freely negotiated by the two sides. The British proposal clearly stipulates that Israel has a moral responsibility to give up the Negev region in exchange for Western Galilee. The United States, even if it does not intend to completely eliminate this point, at least believes that it should have great flexibility. The Political Committee has currently received countless proposals on the Holy Land, and it is feared that no single proposal can obtain a two-thirds majority vote in the General Assembly. One diplomat said, "It seems that we will accomplish nothing because of the Negev." The various proposals that the Political Committee has received are as follows: (1) "British Proposal": Establish a UN Conciliation Committee, adopt part of Bernadotte's recommendations, persuade the Jews to give up the Negev, and the Arabs to recognize Israel. (2) "US Proposal": Aims to supplement the British proposal, reduce the importance of the Bernadotte Plan, and allow the Arab and Jewish sides to negotiate a final solution. (3) "Australian Proposal": Reaffirms the UN partition resolution for Palestine, considers Israel's admission to the United Nations at an early date, establishes a conciliation group, and remains silent on borders and other suggestions. (4) "Colombian Proposal": The main viewpoints are roughly similar to the British and American plans, but stipulate that the conciliation committee should include three world-renowned figures designated by the General Assembly, and stipulate that a separate administrative organization for Jerusalem should be established by the Trusteeship Council.</p>

<p>[Agence France-Presse, Seoul, 24th] The Seoul government formally notified the US government tonight, hoping that the US military would remain in South Korea to prevent the threat of communism. The South Korean Foreign Minister wrote to Marshall today: "I wish to inform you of the resolution passed by the Korean government on November 22, namely, to request you to postpone the withdrawal of US troops stationed in Korea until Korea can ensure its national defense position."

<h3 id="e64">Issues Regarding Tuition Fees at Private Schools: Mayor Announces Handling Measures, Criticizes Principals for Negotiating Multiples of Fees Without Proper Procedures <a href="#e64" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c64" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">64</a></h3>
<p>[Our Report] Although the Joint Association of Faculty and Staff of Private Primary and Secondary Schools in this city previously announced a general leave of absence, some schools still held classes as usual yesterday. Yesterday, the Joint Association of Faculty and Staff of Private Primary and Secondary Schools held a press conference at the New Life Club at 2:00 PM to report on the course of this general leave of absence. At 4:00 PM, Director Li of the Bureau of Education convened a meeting at Yucai Middle School with the board members of the Joint Association of Private Primary and Secondary Schools and the Joint Association of Faculty and Staff of Private Primary and Secondary Schools. Only representatives from Shenpei, Xinjian, and Junde schools attended, and the meeting did not take place. At 6:00 PM, representatives of the Joint Association of Faculty and Staff of Private Primary and Secondary Schools went to the Municipal Government to petition, and Mayor Wu personally received them. The Mayor expressed full sympathy for the difficult lives of the faculty and staff and announced four points of handling measures. He criticized the private school principals for increasing fees without following legal procedures. He believed that the general leave of absence of the faculty and staff was unjustified and would instruct the principals of each school to persuade the faculty and staff to cancel their leave of absence. If this was not possible today, they should resume teaching no later than tomorrow. Mayor Wu also scheduled a meeting with private school principals at 3:00 PM this afternoon in the Municipal Government conference room and instructed Director Li of the Bureau of Education to notify them.</p>
<p>Representatives of the Joint Association of Faculty and Staff of Private Primary and Secondary Schools, Shi Jiadong, Wang Yunyi, Feng Zhen, and Xia Huanxin, went to the Municipal Government to petition yesterday afternoon at 6:00 PM, presenting four demands to Mayor Wu: (1) Please clearly state whether the Mayor considers the current tuition fee increase by private schools to be reasonable. (2) Private school faculty and staff should enjoy the same in-kind allocations as municipal school faculty and staff. (3) Please thoroughly investigate Director Li of the Bureau of Education for abusing his position and causing a serious crisis in private schools. (4) Please sanction radio stations and individuals who maliciously slander and insult private schools. Mayor Wu first explained the circumstances of the private school fee increase, stating that the private school principals had previously requested government relief due to the difficult lives of the faculty and staff and the difficulty in maintaining operations. In addition to approving the priority issuance of special rice, the request for government subsidies could not be fulfilled due to the city's tight finances. In principle, it was agreed to appropriately increase tuition fees to subsidize the lives of faculty and staff. However, considering the burden on parents, the principals of each school were instructed to discuss the fee increase with the Bureau of Education. Subsequently, the private school principals held a meeting on their own and decided to increase fees by two to four times, notifying Director Li by telephone. This was extremely unreasonable in terms of procedure. Because traditionally, the issue of tuition fees should first be discussed with the Bureau of Education, and then jointly approved by the Municipal Government, the Municipal Council, and representatives from all parties, to ensure that school expenses, the lives of faculty and staff, and the burden on parents are all taken into account. However, this time, the private schools increased tuition fees after a decision made by the principals' meeting and then notified the Bureau of Education, which was very inappropriate in terms of procedure.</p>
<h3 id="e65">Principals Should Be Responsible for the Difficult Lives of Faculty and Staff <a href="#e65" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c65" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">65</a></h3>
<p>Strictly speaking, the private school fee increase is not reasonable. Students' parents pay tuition fees in full at the beginning of the semester, which is equivalent to entering into a contract with the school. The school should be responsible for the student's education for the entire semester, and the school also pays the faculty and staff six months' salary in full at once. However, due to the drastic fluctuations in prices, the salary received by the faculty and staff at one time may not be enough to buy daily necessities. To take into consideration the difficult lives of the faculty and staff, he reluctantly approved the appropriate collection of additional tuition fees, but not up to four times as much. This responsibility does not lie with the faculty and staff, but should be borne by the principals of each school. Therefore, the reply to request (1) is that a reasonable increase will be granted, but the procedures are not appropriate. (2) Regarding the request for private school faculty and staff to receive the same in-kind allocations as municipal schools, Mayor Wu stated that municipal schools pay salaries monthly, while private schools pay a semester's salary in full at the beginning of the semester. The treatment of private schools is already better than that of municipal schools, and the government does not have such in-kind allocations, so it is practically impossible. (3) Regarding the request to thoroughly investigate Director Li of the Bureau of Education, Mayor Wu stated that he would first investigate the responsibility for causing this dispute, asking why Director Li had notified the principals several times to discuss the matter but the principals did not attend. (4) Regarding the request to sanction radio stations for verbally abusing private schools, Mayor Wu claimed that, to his knowledge, the abuse was directed at the principals, not the faculty and staff. One of the representatives immediately stated that some faculty and staff were also abused. For example, Xiao Kuaile once stated on the radio that the principals were bosses, the teachers were prostitutes, and the students were嫖客. Upon hearing this, Mayor Wu stated that the Municipal Government is an administrative organ. In addition to notifying the Bureau of Social Affairs to discourage verbal abuse, faculty and staff who feel insulted can appeal to the courts.</p>
<h3 id="e66">Mayor Expresses Full Sympathy for Faculty and Staff <a href="#e66" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c66" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">66</a></h3>
<p>The Mayor stated that he fully sympathized with the faculty and staff, but could not sympathize with the actions of some principals. The general leave of absence under martial law is illegal, and this general leave of absence is unjustified, so he hoped that they would resume teaching immediately. Finally, the Mayor announced four points of handling measures: (1) The exact amount of the tuition fee increase will be determined jointly after inviting the Municipal Council and other parties. (2) The tuition fees collected from this increase should be kept by the faculty and staff, and the principals are not allowed to use a single penny. (3) The accounts of schools that have already increased fees for students will be thoroughly investigated. (4) The principals will be instructed to immediately persuade the faculty and staff to cancel their leave of absence and resume teaching to maintain the students' education. If the principals are at fault, the school board will be asked to replace them, otherwise the Municipal Government will send someone to take over.</p>
<h3 id="e67">Over Two Hundred Silver Shops to Resume Business Today <a href="#e67" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c67" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">67</a></h3>
<p>[Our Report] The silver shops in this city have decided to resume business today. The price of gold ornaments will be in accordance with the regulations of the Gold Control Bureau, which is two thousand one hundred yuan per tael. The purchase price will be a maximum of one thousand nine hundred yuan per tael. The calculation standard for the sale of gold ornaments is based on the Central Bank's price of one thousand yuan per tael, plus a legal profit of 20%, operating expenses of 40%, and a maximum wage of 50%. The selling price of silver ornaments will also be calculated according to this ratio.</p>
<p>Wu Pengnian, the chairman of the Silver Shops Association, and others, went to the Gold Control Bureau yesterday afternoon to meet with Director Lin to discuss the matter. It was decided to comply with the regulations of the Gold Control Bureau. The official document from the Gold Control Bureau approving the Association's resumption of business in accordance with the regulations was also delivered to the Association yesterday afternoon. The Association immediately sent a circular to all of its more than two hundred members for their information and compliance. According to Director Lin of the Gold Control Bureau, the regulated price of two thousand one hundred yuan per tael for the sale of gold ornaments temporarily approved for the silver shops to resume business refers to gold of 995 fineness or higher. If the fineness is insufficient, the price should be reduced proportionally according to the actual fineness.</p>

<p>[Our Report] The Joint Association of Faculty and Staff of Private Middle and Elementary Schools held a press conference at the New Life Club yesterday afternoon at 2:00 PM. Shi Jiadong and Wang Weiqun reported on the course of the general leave of absence of faculty and staff of private middle and elementary schools, stating: (1) This fee increase is entirely for the livelihood of colleagues and cannot be privately obtained by the principals. (2) The principals have suffered unjust accusations for the livelihood of their colleagues. (3) Salaries of faculty and staff account for 70% of the tuition and miscellaneous fees collected by the schools, while administrative expenses account for only 30% at most. The rumor that principals can obtain 70% is untrue. (4) In general, school board members of private schools are unable to be responsible for the school's finances, so the schools appropriately collect fees from students' parents, taking from the students and using it for the students. (5) The government authorized the schools to collect fees because it was unable to provide subsidies. (6) The principals and faculty and staff are mostly law-abiding and have not dared to hoard goods. Now they are affected by the currency devaluation. (7) Although the schools have set fee amounts for this fee increase, they are by no means mandatory and are only the maximum limit. Students from poor families and children of public school teachers are allowed to reduce or waive fees if they are truly unable to pay. Schools have never refused. (8) This general leave of absence was truly forced. The Bureau of Education allowed the collection of fees previously, but then stated that it never approved it, causing social surprise and parental bewilderment. Colleagues believe that livelihood is a small matter, but dignity is a big matter. The Director of the Bureau of Education, as the leader of the colleagues, does not respect himself and places the colleagues in a state of bewilderment, causing parental blame and social disturbance. 士可殺而不可辱, hence they were forced to take this general leave of absence.</p>

<h3 id="e79">Shanghai Prison Murder Case: Coffin Exhumed for Re-Examination Yesterday: Suspect Guards Summoned for Questioning: Contradictions Discovered in Confessions: Further Investigation Scheduled for Today <a href="#e79" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c79" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">79</a></h3>
<p>[Our Report] The case of the assassination of Jin Duanliang, a guard at Shanghai Prison No. 26, had been determined by autopsy to be caused by fatal burns inflicted with a high-temperature iron object while he was alive. It had been investigated in court several times, and relatively rich leads had been obtained. The District Prosecutor's Office recently exhumed the coffin at the request of Warden Kong Xianglin. The coffin was exhumed in Minhang again yesterday and transported to the Changde Road autopsy site for re-examination. After the coffin was opened, the body was already rotting, but the two wounds on the thighs were still obvious, and the wound on the genitals was also clearly visible. After re-opening the chest for examination, Sun Kui, the director of the Forensic Medicine Research Institute and the director of the Shanghai Prison Hospital, cut off the genitals and took them away along with the heart. They then went to the prison scene, where Sun Kui, Cao Hong, Tang Meiqiao, Kong Xianglin, Huo Chunsheng, and Gao Yongan conducted a detailed investigation and summoned suspect guards Wang Fuming and Ding Shouxing for questioning. It was discovered that the confessions of the two contradicted each other, and the prosecutor believed that they were highly suspicious. However, because it was late, all the relevant guard staff could not be summoned. It was decided that a detailed investigation would be conducted at the prison again at 9:00 AM today. Prosecutor Cao handed the list of about ten relevant people to Warden Kong Xianglin for safekeeping. It is expected that this case will be clarified soon under the close attention of all parties.</p>

<h3 id="e82">Shanghai Chamber of Commerce Urges Dredging of Freight Traffic, Abolition of Negotiated Pricing and Exemption from Income Tax, and Suggests Resuming Operations of the Stock Exchange <a href="#e82" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c82" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">82</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce sent telegrams to the Executive Yuan, the Ministry of Finance, and the Ministry of Industry and Commerce yesterday, urging the dredging of freight traffic and floating capital, the abolition of the negotiated pricing system, the restoration of a free market, and exemption from income tax for the first half of the 38th year, stating:</p>
<p>Curbing Obstruction of Customs and Freight to Ensure Smooth Flow of Goods</p>
<p>It is found that the actions of local governments to obstruct the exit of materials originated from the strict implementation of the price control policy. Even though the government promulgated supplementary measures for financial and economic reforms on October 30th of this year, which clearly stipulated that local governments should not hinder the flow of goods and that those who arbitrarily obstruct customs and freight would be severely punished, it is inevitable that there are cases where freight traffic is still delayed due to adherence to established practices or failure to receive clear orders. It is requested that your esteemed Yuan and Ministry effectively curb this situation to ensure the smooth flow of goods and balanced supply and demand to help stabilize prices. This is one point. It is found that the suspension of the stock exchange originated at the beginning of the currency reform, and its purpose was undoubtedly to completely eliminate speculation and indirectly assist in the completion of the August 19th price control policy. Now that the price control has been lifted and the situation has changed, the promotion of subsequent policies should focus on supporting production and dredging floating capital as urgent tasks. The establishment of a stock exchange is mainly to execute the intermediary between productive enterprises and investors and to absorb floating capital into the task of investing in the right track. If it is desired to revitalize productive enterprises and curb the evil of floating capital in the future, the stock exchange should be resolutely allowed to resume operations immediately. This is the second point.</p>
<p>Abolish Cost-Based Pricing to Restore a Free Market</p>
<p>The rise and fall of prices has its natural law in economics, the so-called scarcity of goods leads to high prices, while abundance leads to low prices. If efforts are not made to increase production and dredge the source of goods, but instead to suppress the natural changes in prices, it is like trying to stem the flow of a river to the east, and it is likely to eventually breach. The failure of the past price control policy can serve as a warning. Since the government promulgated supplementary measures for financial and economic reforms and lifted price controls, prices have risen once, but have recently gradually stabilized. In many cases, the decline from the time of the rise has been more than half. This is a reflection of the gradual normalization of supply and demand as the source of goods is smooth. Unfortunately, the supplementary measures failed to completely open up price controls, and the negotiated pricing system based on cost-based pricing was still retained. Its malpractices have made it impossible for both producers and retailers to completely avoid the pain of decoupling. As a result, the production side still feels that the supply of raw materials is difficult, and sales merchants also have the trouble of cost-based pricing, which is contrary to the natural law of economics. From a purely economic standpoint, since the rise and fall of prices have their natural levels, it is better to remove the root cause than to simply pour soup to stop boiling. If the cost-based pricing method can be abolished and the free market can be completely restored, while strictly cracking down on hoarding and speculating, and effectively dredging the source of goods, supporting production, and guiding floating capital to the right track, then price stability can be ensured. This is the third point.</p>
<p>Handling of Profit and Loss Items: Please Exempt Income Tax</p>
<p>In addition, Article 8, paragraph 2 of the recently promulgated and implemented "Measures for the Registration of Changes in the Conversion of Registered Capital of Profit-Making Enterprises into Gold Yuan" stipulates: "If the amount of capital obtained by deducting all liabilities from the estimated assets exceeds the standards stipulated in these measures, the excess part shall be treated as profit and loss items…". The phrase "should be treated as profit and loss items" was not in the original draft and was added during the amendment. The main purpose is that the portion of the asset estimate that exceeds the standard capital amount should be regarded as the income of the profit-making enterprise, requiring it to pay income tax. However, it is not known that the portion of the asset estimate that exceeds the standard capital amount is not the income of the enterprise itself, but purely a manifestation of the adjustment and restoration of the low currency value over the years. There is absolutely no increase in the net assets of the enterprise. Therefore, it is unreasonable to order it to pay income tax in accordance with the law. This point should also be corrected to relieve the difficulties of industry and commerce. This is the fourth point. Since the implementation of the currency reform and the implementation of price control policies, raw materials have been blocked, production has shrunk, panic buying has been rampant, and nine out of ten stores have been empty. After the opening of price controls, prices have soared. Stores have made huge losses in purchasing goods in the original currency, and some have even been unable to resume business. For the benefit of industry and commerce, the government should take measures to remedy the situation. The Association suggests that the central government approve the exemption of profit-making enterprises from income tax for the first half of the 38th year (i.e., the income of profit-making enterprises in the second half of the 37th year), which must be said to be an urgent and reasonable requirement. This is the fifth point. Obey Orders to Register Various Goods: It is Improper to Purchase According to Price Limits</p>
<p>In addition, the Association telegraphed the Bureau of Social Affairs regarding the matter that various goods registered by industry and commerce should not be purchased according to price limits, stating: Since important daily necessities and industrial raw materials have been changed to cost-based pricing, it is no longer appropriate to use price limits. It is improper for the government to forcibly purchase goods at the price limits, giving law-abiding merchants an undue blow. If it is said that the cost price of these registered items is mostly below the price limits of August 19, it is appropriate to collect them at the price limits, then the only option for factories and commercial establishments that sell at the price limits and then replenish at market prices of ten or dozens of times is to go bankrupt, which is very clear. In this situation, it is tantamount to confiscating their registered items. The government favors a portion of the population while causing industry and commerce to suffer an undue sacrifice, which is no different from neighboring as firm. Moreover, among the items in the general registration scope, the only ones that are necessary for personal or family life are rice, flour, cloth, cooking oil, coal, and sugar. As for呢羢 and cigarettes, they are neither within the scope of banning important daily necessities nor in the list of general registration of daily necessities, and it seems even more inappropriate to move from类 and as class, without any choice. Since the country is in a difficult situation, consolidating the hearts of the people is the first priority. The first measure to deal with it is to implement Article 7 of the Constitution, which stipulates that "All people of the Republic of China are equal before the law, regardless of class". Respectfully expressing my humble opinion, I hope that your esteemed Bureau will review the situation and transfer the correct opinion, so that the涸轍's attached, can celebrate the re-birth, which is truly a public convenience.</p>
<p>Enclosed with Fixed Deposit Certificates in Gold: Please Allow Circulation and Transfer</p>
<p>Furthermore, in accordance with the resolution of the members' congress, the Association requested the government to allow the circulation and transfer of gold that is attached to fixed deposit certificates of the same amount in order to show monetary credit. The Association also sent a telegram to the Executive Yuan and the Ministry of Finance yesterday, requesting that it be adopted and implemented.</p>
<p>Also, at around 7:00 AM yesterday morning, a cooking accident occurred at the office of Yuanfengxing Kee Timber Company, Room 406, No. 133 Jiujiang Road. It was extinguished immediately, and the damage was minor.</p>

<p>Due to the barbering industry's request to adjust prices not being approved by the authorities, most barber shops in various districts such as Eastern Shanghai have automatically closed down since yesterday. The industry's labor union, because capitalists are forcing workers to stop work, affecting their livelihoods, specially dispatched representatives to see Mayor Wu at the city government at 9:00 AM yesterday to report the facts of the matter. They stated that the responsibility for the closure should lie with the capitalists and requested an order to the industry association to resume normal operations. The mayor stated that the case should be handled by the Social Affairs Bureau, and the representatives left accordingly. In the afternoon, labor and management each sent dozens of representatives to petition the Social Affairs Bureau. The capitalist association also submitted a cost calculation table, stating that since the price restrictions were lifted, workers' meals, fuel, decorations, and other supplies have generally increased more than twentyfold. They requested, in accordance with the government's principle of setting prices based on cost, that adjustments be permitted. The Social Affairs Bureau official in charge stated that the industry has already been approved twice since the price restrictions were lifted, increasing prices a total of ninefold. Therefore, any further adjustment of sales prices should wait until the publication of the cost of living index at the end of the month, and ordered both parties to resume business immediately. Worker representatives also stated that the shops told them that if they wanted to open for business, they would only provide two meals of thin porridge per day. If they closed down, they would continue to provide three meals of white rice as before. Some people are also instigating a "general leave" of all barbers in the city. The workers agree with adjusting sales prices, but do not agree with the tactic of using workers' leave.</p>

<p>[Our Correspondent] The collection of motor vehicle license tax and municipal construction tax in Shanghai, which began on the first of this month, has reached two-thirds of the total amount. In order to avoid congestion, the Finance Bureau has scheduled a phased payment process, expecting to collect the full amount by the end of next month. Overdue payments will be subject to a penalty of one times the tax amount. For municipal construction tax, overdue payments within 10 days will be penalized at one-tenth of the tax amount, within 20 days at two-tenths, and within 30 days at three-tenths. The vehicle license will also be withheld.</p>

<p>(2) Regarding the issue of conditional redemption, the government has indeed taken on a significant burden. Originally, under currency management, domestic redemption was unnecessary. All gold and foreign exchange were concentrated for use as a tool for international balance of payments. Even the strong United States is no exception. How do they maintain the value of their currency? First, the quantity of currency strictly adapts to the needs of the social economy. Second, when settling international balance of payments deficits, gold and foreign exchange are still used according to a fixed ratio. Within the country, the currency is uniformly paper money, but in the foreign exchange market, there is still a fixed standard, and international balance of payments obligations are strictly fulfilled. In normal times, currency is merely a medium of exchange. If holders can obtain foreign exchange or gold to settle international balance of payments deficits according to a fixed ratio when necessary, it will not shake confidence in the value of the currency. The legal tender (fapi) policy of 1935 was successfully built on this theory. Unfortunately, this natural and reasonable method can no longer be used. After the accelerated devaluation of legal tender and the past Gold Yuan, the people have lost confidence in non-redeemable paper money and can only "flee from the currency" (Flied from the Currency). Fleeing from the currency is equivalent to the collapse of the currency. To rescue this crisis, there is no other way but redemption. The British pound has also experienced similar disasters several times in history, and they were overcome by using redemption policies. However, fulfilling the obligation of redemption is indeed a major burden on the government. The obligation of redemption must develop in direct proportion to the amount of Gold Yuan issued, or even super-proportionally. The government should be vigilant about this. Financially, it is necessary to gradually bring revenue and expenditure closer to balance, cultivate sources of tax revenue, increase income, and reduce unnecessary expenditures. In terms of finance, it is necessary to stop the low-interest policy that promotes inflation. In normal times, the central bank's benchmark interest rate leads the market interest rate. In times of inflation, the market interest rate forces the central bank's benchmark interest rate to change accordingly. If the central bank disregards market conditions and always maintains a low-interest policy, idle funds will not be drawn in, lending will expand more and more, the quantity of currency will increase too rapidly, and the stability of the currency and the practice of redemption will inevitably face great difficulties. We anticipate that after the implementation of the amendment measures, the value of the currency will gradually become stable, and people's confidence will naturally recover. The next step is to consider the conditional and comprehensive opening of foreign exchange. Because in the long run, it is much more economical to stabilize the value of the currency with foreign exchange than with gold and silver (it can save currency materials), and the effect is no different. This long-term prospect does not need to be elaborated on for the time being. But the government authorities must plan in advance. As for dealing with the black market for gold and banknotes, we cannot have excessive expectations for the two amendment measures. Since foreign exchange trading is not completely open, and gold and silver are only conditionally redeemable, the black market for gold and banknotes is bound to persist for a short period of time. Since exchanging gold and silver requires paying the same amount of deposit, those who are unwilling to fulfill this condition but still want to hold gold and silver will inevitably seek it in the market at a high price. But even if the black market exists, prices must fluctuate within a fixed limit, so a standard of value can be established no matter what, and a stable economy can be produced under a stable standard of currency value. Furthermore, there is nothing to fear from people saving gold and silver. Only rampant waste or hoarding of materials when a standard of value does not exist is a fatal injury to the national economy. In the past, financial management concentrated its efforts on investigating and prohibiting the possession of gold, banknotes, and silver, which can be said to be abandoning the root and pursuing the branches, and at the same time losing popular support. In fact, financial management should have its reasonable scope. It is a pity that the authorities in the past failed to put more effort into the positive aspects. It is hoped that the financial authorities will be able to make a statement on this in the future. Furthermore, if there is a difference between the market price and the official price of gold and banknotes, then the restoration of the foreign exchange settlement certificate system is also a matter of course. Because only in this way can the official and market rates tend to be consistent, thereby stimulating exports and absorbing overseas remittances, in order to facilitate the implementation of the new monetary system.</p>
<p>Finally, I would like to put forward two expectations: First, I hope that the government can adopt more of the opinions of experts. Financial and economic problems are really too complicated and cannot be handled by being clever on one's own. Chinese society is not without talent. It is a great loss to the country that talent is submerged and the government has no way to approach it. Second, I hope that powerful people who do not understand specialized issues, regarding specialized issues, will remain silent for a while. Finance and economics require ten years of academic study to even begin to speak, and even being able to cite a few foreign textbooks may not count for much, let alone reading some encyclopedias or the like. What is the use? It is necessary to have a comprehensive understanding of the entire field of social sciences and to integrate it with the country's cultural traditions in order to have the qualifications to speak on China's finance and economics. The lives and property of hundreds of millions of people must not be repeatedly experimented with by "outsiders"! The lessons of the past few decades have been painful enough!</p>

<p>[Our Correspondent] The final match of the Third Small Soccer Field Tournament, Zhichao vs. Railway, was held at the Nanshi Stadium at 3:00 PM yesterday. Due to the inclement weather, the audience was only about 2,000 people. As a result, a double goose egg, zero to zero, was not divided the victory. Because of the rain, both sides agreed not to extend the time, and the game ended in a tie. The remaining decision, will be determined by the Small Soccer Commission. In the first half, both sides had offensive. Zhichao's general Wu Qixiang sat in the back, and the Railway's multiple offenses relied on Wu Qixiang's proper rescue to avoid incidents. Zhichao's surrounded attack, Railway's inner guard fouled 13 yards from the gate, Wu Qixiang kicked, but was saved by Liao Xiong. Neither side scored in the first half.</p>
<p>In the second half, drizzle drizzled, the stadium was muddy and unbearable, the ball was difficult to control, and the two sides fought in the rain, and the excitement was greatly reduced. As a result of the fierce battle between the two sides, they never managed to enter the door. After that, the rain became heavier, and the heroes were even more useless. At the end of the time, the two sides shook hands and made peace.</p>

<p>[Our Correspondent] There were originally three games in the Chenyou Cup basketball tournament tonight.

<h3 id="e98">Ample Supply, Slow Movement - Rice Market Listless - Flour, Grains, and Oil Prices All Decline <a href="#e98" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c98" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">98</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's rice market was stable in the Nanshi market and declined in the Beishi market. Due to sluggish sales, rice shops were very disinterested. Arrivals were still smooth, especially the early and late rice and thin rice new crops from Nangang, with low prices at the origin. With ample supply and slow movement, the price of white rice in Beishi retreated to 55 Jinyuan, thin rice to 430 Jinyuan, and early rice and others fell by 25 to 20 Jinyuan. In the Nanshi market, the prices of thick and thin rice barely stabilized, and early rice fell by 5 Jinyuan. The market outlook is even more tired and lacks takers. Prices for Yin rice and white rice are the softest. Yesterday, 4,226 shi of goods arrived in the Nanshi market, and 5,604 shi in the Beishi market, totaling nearly 10,000 shi.</p>
<p>Flour continued to decline, due to sluggish sales and high interest rates, owners were eager to sell, so the market could not rise. Lao Che flour opened at 140 Jinyuan, and Bingshun at 135 Jinyuan, each falling by 5 to 7 Jinyuan. Hongfeng and Jiancheng each fell by 2 to 3 Jinyuan. Xiong brand flour was abundant in supply, and prices fell by 3 to 4 Jinyuan. Bran sales were still active in rural areas, and prices stabilized. Wheat was at 180 Jinyuan.</p>
<p>Grains uniformly declined again, the market atmosphere was weak, sales were very strong, but actual sales were quite sluggish and difficult to sell, so prices declined. Factories did not take soybeans, and finally sold at 155 Jinyuan, falling by about 10 Jinyuan. Red rice was supplied in large quantities but sales were sluggish, falling by 5 Jinyuan. Corn from the northern gangs was slightly touched, and the price barely stabilized. There was not much trading in Yuan wheat and Mung beans, and the market was said to be stable. The price of selected green beans did not rise or fall. Sesame was reduced by 20 to 30 Jinyuan. There were many arrivals of raw peanuts, falling by 50 to 60 Jinyuan.</p>
<p>Edible oil prices finally fell again due to the sluggish sales situation. The main street was not interested, customer sales were stagnant, and factories opened a lot, but there were few takers. Soybean oil was 760 Jinyuan, but was taken at a lower price of 730 Jinyuan, falling by 50 Jinyuan. Vegetable oil was 610 and 590 Jinyuan, falling by 20 Jinyuan. Raw oil fell by 60 Jinyuan, Jiton raw oil was 960 Jinyuan, and Xiaoche sesame oil was 770 Jinyuan. Soybean cake was bought by the Shantou gang, and the situation was unique. Yu Ji cake was 69 Jinyuan, rising by 4 Jinyuan.</p>
<h3 id="e99">Foreign Exchange Transfer Certificates - Market Price Unchanged <a href="#e99" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c99" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">99</a></h3>
<p>The market price of foreign exchange transfer certificates remained at 25 Jinyuan yesterday, the same as the day before, with no rise or fall. Overseas remittances poured in, and exporters prepared more export funds, but importers needed less because import quotas had not yet been issued, so the market price was not easily raised.</p>
<h3 id="e100">Export Merchants Hope for Improvement <a href="#e100" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c100" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">100</a></h3>
<p>Additional News: Although there have been transactions in foreign exchange transfer certificates recently, the transaction price of 25 Jinyuan is still about 40% away from the current actual price. Export merchants in Shanghai are all concerned about this phenomenon. They believe that if this disconnect is not quickly improved, it may have a great impact on the export business and overseas remittances, which are showing signs of improvement. They also pointed out that the formation of this phenomenon is mainly due to the fact that the Import and Export Management Committee has not yet relaxed and accelerated the issuance of import permits. Therefore, they hope that the Import and Export Management Committee can make a quick decision on relaxing the audit standards for imports. However, officials believe that this is an inevitable phenomenon at the beginning, and they believe that in the near future, a reasonable standard for the price of foreign exchange transfer certificates will be found.</p>
<h3 id="e101">Banks Suspend Overdrafts and Loans <a href="#e101" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c101" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">101</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the money supply tightened, and interest rates rose.</p>
<p>The Bankers Association urgently informed all member banks and firms yesterday, stating that the market has been fluctuating quite sharply recently. From now on, overdrafts and loans will be suspended, and short-term interbank lending and commercial paper discounting will be the main focus.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the money supply suddenly tightened again, and the black market interest rate rose to 30%. The reasons for this are: (1) A lot of idle funds flowed south, while remittances to Shanghai decreased, resulting in a shortage of funds. (2) The government has sold a lot of gold and silver dollars in recent days, resulting in a greater shortage of cash.</p>

<p>Calculated at 70% of the Exchange Settlement Certificate</p>
<p>[Our Correspondent] The Business Bureau of the Central Bank specially issued Circular No. 163 yesterday to all designated banks, stating that: Regarding the regulations for overdue exchange settlement of export consignment goods, from now on, it will be calculated at 70% of the foreign exchange transfer certificate price on the date of exchange settlement. The bank's previous Circular No. 158 should be repealed.</p>

<p>[Our Correspondent] The number of deposits exchanged by national banks on the 24th increased significantly compared to the previous few days. On that day, the four banks of Zhongzhongjiaonong redeemed a total of 2,400 taels, 4 mace, 1 fen, and 6 li of gold, recovering 2,400,416 Jinyuan. 24,353 silver dollars were redeemed, recovering 243,532 Jinyuan. The above totaled 2,643,946 Jinyuan recovered. Deposits also increased by one time, totaling 5,287,892 Jinyuan recovered.</p>
<h3 id="e104">Whether the Stock Exchange Will Resume Operations - Still Awaiting Decision from Authorities <a href="#e104" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c104" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">104</a></h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent] Gu Shanchang, Deputy Manager of the Shanghai Stock Exchange, went to Nanjing on the 23rd to negotiate with the relevant authorities of the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, and returned to Shanghai a few days ago.</p>
<p>It is speculated that Gu's trip was related to requesting the resumption of the stock exchange's operations. However, according to Gu, he held comprehensive talks with the relevant authorities of the two ministries on the securities business in a detached position. In particular, the issue of the issuance of stocks of state-owned enterprises was discussed in detail. As for the resumption of the stock exchange's operations, it is still awaiting a final decision from the authorities.</p>
<h3 id="e105">Guests from Elsewhere Constantly Searching for Purchases - Cotton Yarn Triggers a Rising Trend - Cloth Sales Sluggish, Price Fluctuations Narrow <a href="#e105" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c105" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">105</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's yarn market was driven by the influx of idle funds into the market, with the money supply gradually loosening. Yarn firms on the main street and the Guang gang all started to become active, absorbing all available yarns, both thick and thin, causing the market atmosphere to suddenly become excited.</p>
<p>42-count Blue Phoenix fine yarn saw asking prices surge past 12,000 customs taels. Although there were profit-taking sales in the middle, the market quickly recovered as buyers' appetite was too strong, and the market continued to soar, rising all the way to 12,800 yuan at the close, up another 600 yuan from the previous day.</p>
<p>21-count Double Horse yarn saw particularly strong buyers. As soon as asking prices were announced, they rose, and at noon, they rose again to close at 9,800 yuan, a uniquely large increase of 1,700 yuan. Other 16-count Benteng, 10-count Boy Scout, 20-count Jincheng, and 32-count and 40-count and other various thick and thin yarns were sought by Guang gangs from outside the industry to be transported south, and the trend was surprisingly brisk. As a result, asking prices were uniformly raised by 400-500 yuan to 1,300-4,500 yuan.</p>
<p>The cloth market saw sluggish actual sales and abundant supplies. The Tianjin gang was selling a lot of goods, but cloth merchants and door shop gangs on the main street were not interested, and price fluctuations were very small.</p>
<p>12-pound Longtou fine cloth once showed a rising trend in the middle, but finally remained at the original price of 365 yuan, leveling with the previous day. Sijunzi yuan billi fabrics, built by the textile factory, were sluggish, and the results were similar to the previous day. The market atmosphere for other bleached cloth, coarse cloth, and Shilin cloth was also very flat.</p>
<p>Spot Cotton Rises</p>
<p>The spot cotton market yesterday saw prices rise due to the sudden surge in cotton yarn. The prices of various grades of fine velvet averaged an increase of 10%, but most of the transactions were still scattered. There were later inquiries for Zhoupu fenhua cotton, but there was no increase in price yesterday.</p>
<h3 id="e106">Tea Market Buzzing with Buying Activity <a href="#e106" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c106" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">106</a></h3>
<p>The domestic tea market continued to see transactions yesterday in the main street and other places, and the market atmosphere was lively. As for export box tea, although the buying interest of exporters such as Tongfu, Huacha, Yihe, Wuchang, and Xinhua in Shanghai was as strong as ever, holders of tea were still cautious due to depleted inventories and thoughts sparked after the announcement of the new foreign exchange transaction methods. Asking prices soared even more like kites off the string, soaring all the way to the clouds. It is said that the annual Wutun tea from the main gang was asking for as much as 1,600 yuan per load, and special Qimen tea even required 2,000 yuan, while Pingshui tea from the main gang was 1,000 yuan, and they were unwilling to part with it, making transactions more difficult to unfold. However, the situation is becoming more and more solid, and the future is more likely to rise than fall.</p>
<h3 id="e107">Food Continues to Decline <a href="#e107" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c107" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">107</a></h3>
<p>The sugar market yesterday remained sluggish. Out-of-town sales were sluggish, and inventories on the main street were abundant. The market was miserable. Furthermore, the Taiwan Sugar Corporation distributed coarse sugar again, and the industry was scrambling to make up for the shortfall, and the money supply showed a slight tightness. The market moved into a soft phase. No. 45 Chebai fine sugar closed at 350 yuan, down slightly by 5 yuan. Coarse sugar and medium sugar turned flat after softening, and the market was neither good nor bad. Xinghua white and Zhang Diaoqing were all weak.</p>
<h3 id="e108">Today's Refuge for Hong Kong's Upper-Class Refugees <a href="#e108" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c108" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">108</a></h3>
<p>— Our Correspondent, Ziqian</p>
<p>[Our Hong Kong Dispatch, 20th] The Taikoo Shipping Company's Shengjing vessel arrived in Hong Kong from Shanghai on the 19th, instantly recreating a "Refugee Fleeing Famine" scene at the Central waterfront that had not been seen for many years. This situation was akin to the chaos, hustle, and bustle of refugees awaiting ships to leave Hong Kong during its occupation. However, this time, the "refugees" were arriving in Hong Kong, not leaving. Hong Kong, this small island, is now once again playing its role as a haven for Chinese "refugees," a position it has assumed repeatedly in modern Chinese history. Before the Shengjing vessel arrived in Hong Kong, there were already four or five special flights chartered by wealthy individuals from Shanghai to Hong Kong. Many people were also taking the Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway to escape to Hong Kong via Guangzhou every day. However, these were all wealthy individuals, each well-dressed and with full purses. The people of Hong Kong treated them as ordinary tourists. However, the passengers on the Shengjing vessel mostly appeared impoverished, fully embodying the essence of "refugees."</p>
<p>Hotels of All Sizes Announce Full Occupancy</p>
<p>In Hong Kong Central, officials have been busy planning the work of accommodating "refugees" these past two days. However, their target for accommodation is British expatriates withdrawing from North and Central China to Hong Kong, unrelated to the yellow-faced, black-eyed Chinese "refugees." This is because hotels of all sizes in Hong Kong Central have now announced that they are fully occupied. Our millionaires and billionaires have even taken over foreign-owned hotels. For the sake of money, the hotel owners are too embarrassed to ask these newly arrived "upper-class Chinese" to leave.</p>
<p>Business Booms, Premium Prices Rebound</p>
<p>The lukewarm atmosphere in Hong Kong at the beginning of the issuance of Gold Standard banknotes has now become a thing of the past. According to reliable sources, it is estimated that Hong Kong has gained 5,000 to 7,000 people in the past two or three weeks. Although they are not all rich and powerful figures, they are at least their assistants, advance troops, and family members, etc. Since the hotels are filled by them, foreign general merchandise companies, woolen shops, the catering industry, and entertainment venues have also seen their profits triple due to their arrival, creating an atmosphere of prosperity. The premium prices for new buildings, which had been declining two months ago, have now rebounded. For example, new buildings on the edge of Causeway Bay used to have a premium price of about 6,000 yuan per floor, but now it has increased to 10,000 yuan, and the rent has increased from 300 yuan per month to 400 yuan, but there is still more demand than supply.</p>
<p>Five Gold Ingots - All Confiscated</p>
<p>A Reuters London dispatch on the 17th said that the British House of Commons has noted the situation of "a large number of Chinese refugees entering Hong Kong without restriction." It is generally speculated that the Hong Kong government may restore the immigration law that was once implemented before the war to cope with this situation, restricting the entry of Chinese people. However, the Hong Kong government may be too busy welcoming the above-mentioned upper-class "refugees," and the targets of their consideration for restriction are probably the type of people carried by the Shengjing vessel.</p>
<p>The day before yesterday, at Kai Tak Airport, the wife of a tycoon had five gold ingots on her, which were seized by Hong Kong Customs. Those gold ingots were naturally confiscated (Hong Kong regulations prohibit the import of gold). A message to those coming to Hong Kong: do not carry gold, otherwise, you will give your money to others for nothing. Not only will they not thank you, but they will also send you to court!</p>

<h3 id="e110">Further Response to Readers Regarding Scholarships <a href="#e110" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c110" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">110</a></h3>
<p>On the 23rd of last month, we provided a general response to readers regarding the "Reader Scholarship Fund." Now that this year's scholarship work is nearing its end, many readers and applicant students have written to inquire, so we are providing another general response here. At the same time, we want to express our deep hope to the listed schools, appealing on behalf of poor students.</p>
<p>Of the students who applied for our newspaper's Reader Scholarship Fund, 329 were initially approved by our newspaper, including 95 private universities, colleges, middle schools, and vocational schools. Later, after a review by the Scholarship Unified Review Committee, only 137 were approved. The remaining 192 were not approved because the schools they attended either never submitted a roster of tuition-free students to the Scholarship Unified Review Committee for verification, or the roster was submitted but the number of tuition-free spots was insufficient. We have heard that the Scholarship Unified Review Committee will transfer these affected students to the Education Bureau to instruct the schools to provide tuition-free education; however, we cannot predict whether the schools will comply.</p>
<p>The following 16 schools did not submit a roster of tuition-free students:</p>
<p>Huxin Middle School Yuhnianhui Middle School</p>
<p>Minzhi Middle School Dongnan Middle School</p>
<p>Mengxian Middle School Weiyu Middle School</p>
<p>Dade Midwifery China Middle School</p>
<p>Xinhua Middle School Minli Middle School</p>
<p>Qixiu Girls' Middle School St. Francis Middle School</p>
<p>Zhengzhong Middle School Attached Middle School of the Law School</p>
<p>Zhengzhong Girls' Middle School Patriotic Girls' Middle School</p>
<p>The following 19 schools had an insufficient number of tuition-free spots:</p>
<p>Guangcheng Pharmaceutical Vocational Jiangxi Middle School</p>
<p>Xihua Middle School Zhende Middle School</p>
<p>Minli Girls' Middle School Xiejin Middle School</p>
<p>Huaien Middle School Datong Attached Middle School Second Hospital</p>
<p>Chongshi Middle School Xuhui Girls' Middle School</p>
<p>Dongnan Pharmaceutical Vocational Datong Attached Middle School First Hospital</p>
<p>Yueche Middle School Jiancheng Middle School</p>
<p>Jingwen Girls' Middle School Nanyang Middle School</p>
<p>Zhenche Attached Middle School Xiaoming Girls' Middle School</p>
<p>Yuedong Middle School</p>
<p>According to the regulations of the Scholarship Unified Review Committee, students applying for scholarships from any organizations or groups must be attending a school that already has the required number of tuition-free spots in order to be approved. This was originally intended to prevent schools from "being generous at others' expense," but in reality, it has affected the application rights of poor students. Our Reader Scholarship Fund aims to help poor students, and it is truly regrettable that they have been denied assistance due to the schools they attend. In addition to expressing our deepest apologies and concern, we hope that the Scholarship Unified Review Committee's remedial measures will be readily accepted by the schools.</p>
<p>Nowadays, many people believe that many private schools in Shanghai are "degree mills," but this is not entirely true. We firmly believe that the purpose of the schools listed above is to cultivate talent, and that the administrators are all well-known figures in the education field. The fact that the number of tuition-free spots is insufficient or that no roster of tuition-free students was submitted may be due to other difficulties and reasons that are understandable. Therefore, we are confident that the authorities of these schools will be able to make an effort to accept the Scholarship Unified Review Committee's remedial measures and ensure that poor students are not disappointed.</p>
<p>In addition, we would like to clarify that many poor students who originally applied to the Scholarship Unified Review Committee have recently been approved by the committee, which has requested that our newspaper's scholarship fund provide assistance, totaling 370 people. As our aim is to help students, we have readily agreed. (Please refer to the lists in the Tai Lan section on the 22nd and 23rd).</p>
<p>Finally, we would like to express our sincere gratitude to the donating readers!</p>

<h3 id="e111">"It Is Surely About Rectifying Names" <a href="#e111" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c111" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">111</a></h3>
<p>— Leiting</p>
<p>"Rectifying names" seems to be an unshakable habit among famous scholars in our country. This is of course deeply influenced by the saying "If names are not correct, words are not in accordance," and the particularly important key lies in "words not being in accordance."</p>
<p>However, in the current society and country, where everything is abnormal, can the work of rectifying names and making words in accordance achieve good results? This is, of course, a big question mark in the eyes of discerning people!</p>
<p>For example, from the government's policy guidelines to the regulations of general social organizations, which one, which item, which aspect is not logical and reasonable? Not only are "words in accordance," but "names are also correct." However, when it comes to implementation, how many are nominally existent but practically dead?</p>
<p>However, the thoughts and purposes of most "name rectifiers" are still focused on "rectifying names."</p>
<p>For example, the rise in prices, the increase in taxes, or anything else related to the increase in costs; the simplest thing to say is that prices are rising. But some people think that the word "price increase" is too stimulating, too obvious, and has the suspicion of inciting price fluctuations. Thus, a more moderate "adjustment" is produced to adjust it.</p>
<p>In this way, the rather provocative word "price increase" is no longer written or spoken by anyone. Thus, although the newspapers are full of records of adjustments, and everywhere is a cry for adjustments, the "name rectifiers" turn a blind eye and a deaf ear, as if the world is truly peaceful. Because nothing has increased in price.</p>
<p>However, in the past two years, although ordinary people have not been stimulated by price increases, they have long been unable to bear the gifts of adjustments, and they feel that adjustments seem to be more terrifying than price increases. However, the thoughts and purposes of most "name rectifiers" are still focused on "rectifying names."</p>
<p>For example, recently, teachers and staff in private primary and secondary schools, unable to bear the large "adjustments" of all prices, and unable to survive, have requested an increase in × fees (because officials do not allow the use of names such as tuition or miscellaneous fees, and the primary and secondary school associations have not determined a name, so they dare not act without authorization and use × to replace it). The official's response is: first, they express deep sympathy for the plight of the teachers and staff; second, the city treasury is depleted and cannot help; third, × fees can be increased, but names such as tuition or miscellaneous fees cannot be used, and the multiple cannot be specified; fourth, the amount to be collected should be negotiated by the school authorities and the students' parents.</p>
<p>For the first two points, these officials, even in the midst of their busy official duties, still pay attention to this group of small teachers struggling on the starvation line. I think they have nothing to say except to be extremely grateful. The concern for the burdens of the students' parents in the fourth point shows the authorities' consideration of maintaining education and caring for the people's sufferings, which makes people even more admiring. But for the intention of the third point, one cannot help but feel perplexed.</p>
<p>Because students are seeking knowledge, the fees they pay should be called tuition; schools are places for teaching, so the fees they collect should be called tuition; and the teachers' remuneration (from the ancient system, respecting teachers) is stipulated to be paid from the tuition by the authorities, so it is also taking tuition. Since the fees increased this time are for the teachers and staff to take, it can be said to be preventing unscrupulous school owners from enriching themselves, which is understandable. As for not allowing the use of the word "tuition," putting down the books, it is truly "the higher I look up, the more lofty it seems!"</p>
<p>In fact, whether it is called a respect-teacher fee, a professional development fee, or even a donation, the biggest purpose of the poor teachers is just to hope to get a little more money to sell their lives to maintain their minimum living for a few more days, that is all. On the parents' side, no matter what it is called, they still have to take out some money, that is all. Eight taels is still half a catty.</p>
<p>However, the "name rectifiers" are still focused on "rectifying names"!</p>
<p>"It is surely about rectifying names?" This is the way of the sage.</p>
<p>This humble one is not clever, and respectfully accepts the teaching!</p>
<h3 id="e112">On Abhorring Evil <a href="#e112" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c112" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">112</a></h3>
<p>— Wu Yong</p>
<p>Mencius said, "If the virtuous are honored and the capable are employed, and outstanding talents are in positions, then all the scholars in the world will be pleased and willing to stand in their court." This is of course the case, there's no need to mention it. However, I personally believe that Mencius said this to the ruler, not to "all the scholars in the world." Therefore, it does not contain the meaning of asking people to hide their light and bide their time. Mencius did not say that the "standing in their court" of scholars must be conditional on the superiors "honoring the virtuous and employing the capable, and outstanding talents being in positions." It should be known that if the ruler has already reached the point of "honoring the virtuous and employing the capable, and outstanding talents being in positions," then whether the scholars "are willing to stand in their court" is no longer important, and there is no need to emphasize it further.</p>
<p>According to Mencius, the personality of Bo Yi in ancient times was: "He would not serve a ruler who was not his ruler, nor befriend a friend who was not his friend; he would not stand in the court of evil people, nor speak with evil people; standing in the court of evil people and speaking with evil people was like sitting on charcoal with court clothes and a court hat; pushing the heart of abhorring evil, thinking of standing with the villagers; if his hat was not straight, he would leave with a worried look, as if about to flee." The spirit of Bo Yi, who cherishes his integrity and hates evil like an enemy, is admired by later generations. However, I think his "not befriending a friend who was not his friend, not standing in the court of evil people, not speaking with evil people," etc., are somewhat excessive. This kind of behavior is somewhat similar to what people now call "ostrichism" in a negative sense. Therefore, Mencius's comment is "Bo Yi is narrow." The reason why people are evil is that they have little contact with good people; "the court of evil people," as the name suggests, should mean that good people are not in the court. If good people retreat to the mountains and forests and do not compete with the world, the world will inevitably become more evil and things will become worse. In this way, the "goodness" of good people does not work on the evil of evil people, so why is there any value in having good people in the world? Therefore, only when there are evil people in the world is it all the more necessary for good people to put themselves in the ranks of the court.</p>
<p>Bo Yi's starving to death on Shouyang Mountain is worthy of our sympathy. But this is the inevitable result of "not speaking with evil people, not standing in the court of evil people." Regarding this point, the Biography of Marquis Wei Qi and Marquis Wu An in the Records of the Grand Historian says it most clearly: "...Therefore, Marquis Wei Qi was made chancellor, and Marquis Wu An was made grand commandant. Ji Fu congratulated Marquis Wei Qi and then mourned, saying: Your Lordship's temperament is fond of good and hates evil. Now good people praise Your Lordship, so you have become chancellor; but Your Lordship hates evil, and there are many evil people, and they will also slander Your Lordship; if Your Lordship can be tolerant, you will be lucky to last long, if you cannot, you will be removed by slander. Wei Qi did not listen." Marquis Wei Qi not only "liked good," but also firmly advocated "hating evil," and as a result, he was squeezed out by Marquis Wu An and ended up with the fate of being "abandoned in the market."</p>
<p>This kind of ending is of course not very interesting. This makes us think: what kind of position should a person take on "good" and "evil"? There are four possibilities. The first is: to like good and hate evil; the second is: to like good and not hate evil; the third is: to like evil and not hate good; and the fourth is: to like evil and hate good. The second and third paths have the advantage of being stable; to like evil and hate good, although it is good, it tends to be extreme, and there may be times when it does not work, because there are indeed "many evil people" in the world, but the degree may not be so severe, so it is in the same category as "liking good and hating evil," which is "out of touch with the times."</p>
<p>In my personal opinion, it is okay to like good and hate evil; but "liking good" is liking the goodness of others, and "hating evil" is hating one's own evil. If one embraces the attitude of liking the goodness of others and hating one's own evil and interacts with the present world, is it almost right?</p>
<h3 id="e113">A Record of Buying Meat <a href="#e113" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c113" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">113</a></h3>
<p>— You Mo Jun</p>
<p>In the morning, I heard colleagues in the school talking about buying meat to eat. I wondered where the meat came from, and thought that the meager hourly wage earned by shouting until my throat was hoarse and racking my brains every day was only enough to eat a bowl of plain noodles, so where would the money come from to buy meat to eat? Isn't that ridiculous! To tell the truth, all the teachers and students in the school have been vegetarians for a long time; radish, vegetables, and tofu soup, it's always the same old tune every day. When we are hungry, we can comfort ourselves with "If you can bite on vegetable roots, you can do anything," but the vegetables have no oil, and even if they have oil, they can lubricate the intestines, but now the intestines have become "this road is blocked," and magnesium sulfate must be taken!</p>
<p>Where did the meat come from? It turned out that a school worker asked for leave to return to his hometown. It is said that his family slaughtered a pig, so he brought some pork to the school. The price is not expensive, only 16 yuan per catty in Gold Standard banknotes, which is really not expensive! Two days ago, I did know that spare ribs were 24 yuan per catty, and rump was 2 yuan more. A housewife told me personally that she went to the market and saw a piece of spare ribs in a butcher shop. The fat and lean meat looked really good. After weighing it, the price was 27 yuan in Gold Standard banknotes. She touched her body and only had 15 yuan, and in great disappointment, she had to give the spare ribs a glance and leave. Now, each catty of meat only costs 16 yuan, which is almost one-third cheaper than the price two days ago. Wouldn't it be a pity not to eat it? So everyone suggested "eating company," which was considered a meat meal.</p>
<p>A few days ago, I received a letter from my old friend Jiang Danshu, which contained the words "Our school must have 'porridge meals' every night, but actually nothing has happened." The words are humorous and sad. I don't know what thoughts will arise in his mind after reading this article.</p>

<p>I once sold paintings of bamboo in Shanghai to grow bamboo, and wrote poems to record it. Now I have returned to my hometown and live in Dongshan, and I am planting bamboo again, and I often paint bamboo to exchange for rice. I will write this poem again.</p>
<p>Bamboo and Xia An seem to have an appointment, living in seclusion, empty and skillfully arranged. I knew early on that eating meat was not my business (I have not eaten meat for 26 years), and I still have a vacant mind as my teacher. Pine and cypress compete for firmness in the stream, thorns and bushes are no hindrance to making fences. After recovering from illness, I occasionally write and sell paintings, and three paths of string songs can be used for this.</p>

<p>Turning his head, he truly left and will not return, his heroic light is uniquely visible from the cold ashes. Yi invaded the Little Odes and was difficult to abolish, and old spring solitary flowers only bloom on their own. The fire seems to be waiting for a time to come, and orchid grease is fighting to be treasured when there is no talent in the world. Who will continue the uninhibited sound of the South, gazing at the reeds and backtracking.</p>
<h3 id="e115">A Record of Wu Dunzhai <a href="#e115" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c115" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">115</a></h3>
<p>— Chen Zuogao</p>
<p>During the late Qing Dynasty and early Republic of China, famous scholars emerged from Wu Zhong. Among the anecdotes worth discussing, Mr. Wu Dunzhai should be mentioned. Mr. Wu's given name was Yusheng, his courtesy name was Weiru, and his literary name was Dunzhai. He was a Hanlin scholar in the Dingchou year. He was known for his integrity during his time as an official. Weng Tonghe admired him greatly, and the Wu Taishi mentioned repeatedly in his diary is him. When he was still a boy, his father took him to the family ancestral hall because he was losing Li Zi, and his studies were very strict, so he was not allowed to be too relaxed. When he was just 20 years old, he passed the provincial examination and became a jinshi in succession. At the age of 24, he entered the Imperial Academy and served as the chief examiner of Guangdong, Hubei, and Fujian provinces. He and Shen Zengzhi (Meisou) served as the chief examiner of Guangdong at the same time. Kang Youwei of Nanhai, whose registered name was Zuyi, came from his tutelage. For decades, he respected him as a teacher and never waned. During the Hundred Days' Reform, Mr. Wu was released as the Sichuan Educational Commissioner. Wu Xia, such as the Zhang Yi Kun brothers, were all recruited into his staff, and they even served him as their teacher. Later, Zhang Ying was recommended by Mr. Wu to Shen Qiquan, his wife's uncle, for a special economic examination. He was particularly insightful in identifying and promoting talents. During the Qing Dynasty, he served as the Left Vice Minister of the Ministry of Personnel, entered the Grand Council, and served as the Minister of the Ministry of Posts and Communications, known as an honest and famous official. At that time, old officials such as Liang Shiyi, Guan Genglin, and Ye Gongchuo were all his close friends and followers.</p>
<p>After the Republic of China, he deeply understood the meaning of the revolution and never boasted of being a Qing loyalist. Instead, he lived in Qingdao, studying inscriptions diligently. Every year, the income from calligraphy was used to support relatives and friends who had no one to tell. His calligraphy obtained the rules of Yan Zhenqing and the methods of Song Huizong, becoming a great master of the late Qing Dynasty. He could also identify calligraphy, painting, and bronze inscriptions from ancient times, being exquisite and subtle, and was respected by the art world. When he passed through Shanghai in the Yimao year, he stayed at the Yipinxiang Hotel. One day, he met a young man holding a silk fan with the words "So-and-so Tongnian" written on it, signed by Dunzhai. Mr. Wu jokingly asked who the name above was. He said it was his grandfather's name, and that the writer had passed away many years ago. Mr. Wu smiled and said: "I am Dunzhai." The young man left in embarrassment. Even at the age of seventy or more, he still watched three movies a day, walked leisurely, and his spirit was undiminished. His heroic and humorous style was like this. In the Yihai year, he reassigned the Deer Crying Odes, and in the Dingzhuang year (during the Anti-Japanese War), he rejoined the Qionglin Banquet, celebrating two grand events without holding them. Four years later, he died without illness in the island building, leaving behind two sons, Zengzhi and Zengqin, who both graduated from special departments in Belgium and France.</p>
<p>The Wu family has been a family of scholars in Suzhou for generations. Wu Zhongjun (Songfu) and Wu Tingchen (Dihua), known as the Uncle and Nephew Zhuangyuan of Wu, were Mr. Wu's great-great-grandfathers. After Mr. Wu left the Imperial Academy after the Dingchou year, the diaries he wrote continued for 60 years without interruption. This grand masterpiece is extremely valuable for the anecdotes and allusions of the Tongzhi, Guangxu, and Xuantong periods of the Qing Dynasty. It can be compared to Li Yueman and Song Chan. It is a pity that it has not been published. Dai Biaoyuan's preface repeatedly mentioned the gathering of Wu Xia figures, which further confirms this.</p>
