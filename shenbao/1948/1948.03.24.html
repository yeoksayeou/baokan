<p>〔中央社華盛頓廿二日電〕美衆院規則委員會今宣布，衆院定廿三日展開包括經濟及軍事援華之併合援外法案之全面辯論，爲期三日。衆院外交委員會今以長達一百頁關於援外法案之報告書，交予會議，强調中國之情勢，不論在經濟上，或軍事上，均與希望相似。報告書中復指出，爲求中國首先達成改革，而將援助保留之措施，業已試行，但此僅足產生不良之效果。目前中國內部，有某種部隊，係受外國援助及指使者，幾有吞噬全中國之趨勢，倘吾人不予中國援助，則中國或成爲蘇聯之附庸國，或則內戰仍將保持遷延日久之情形。</p>
<p>〔中央社華盛頓廿二日電〕援華法案計分兩部：第一准撥款三億六千三百萬美元給與中國，其用途須援用援歐計劃中可以適用之規定，此種經濟援華之執行事宜，並須由援歐計劃主持人兼負其責；第二，對華之贈予部份，最多爲一億美元，此款中國可斟酌其需要，自定用途，似此則中國可本己意決定，將此款用於軍事方面。外委會旣以此一億美元充贈予部份，聽由中國自定用途，在技術上遂得避免混雜軍事與經濟援助於一案。經衆院與參院全體會議之辯論後，援華法案即將交由兩院外交委員會聯席會議討論解決相異各點，今成爲最從法案送請總統簽署，法案並規定，在國會批准撥款前，先由復興銀公司墊付五千萬美元，開始援華計劃之執行。范登堡告記者稱，援歐計劃之一般目標，可適用於援華計劃者，將包括於雙方成立之協定中。此將規定若干事項諸如自助，與監督用途等是。范氏繼稱，歐洲復原計劃法案之範疇與限制，同樣亦適用於中國。援歐法案之時期規定爲四年，而援華者則爲一年。期滿後，任何對華援助，皆須另由新立法進行之。對華贈予部份之一億美元，將可協助中國政府購買軍事供應品，並可助成美國剩餘軍火與物資之輸往中國，只須中國政府有此意圖即可。（其他有關援華消息刋二版左角）</p>

<h3 id="c23">原則確定後的救濟特捐 <a href="#c23" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e23" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">23</a></h3>
<p>上海區經募救濟特捐，其原則業經第三次會議決定，據吳市長宣佈，其要點為：（一）勸募之對象，改為大善士，與原定發國難財，勝利財，戡亂財諸種名義不同：（二）一切統籌辦理，對於本區各地的捐額，不作硬性規定：（三）捐款人名單，亦俟各地自行擬定。俞財長並聲朋：（一）數額方面，不擬加以硬性規定，或將由各同業公會攤派：（二）對捐款者之姓名，如本人不願發表者，應尊重其意見，不予發表：（三）對於吝嗇之徒，不擬加以勉強，惟冀輿論制裁及道德制裁云云。照此看來，這項救濟特捐，確已名副其實地形成一種特捐，不是稅，而且是一種樂捐，不是強迫的攤派。這與當初擬征一次財產稅的全張合看起來，自不免離題過遠，大有形存實亡之感。但就事論事，現在所擬定的原則，毋寗說是比較最合理的。</p>
<p>因為財產稅是最初所擬定的名稱，經過了許多次的修改，諸如臨時財產稅，臨時財產特稅，臨時財產捐，財產特捐，建國捐，建國特捐之類，其財政上的意味俱很濃　，其技術　　不　稍涉疎泛。現既正式定名為救濟特捐，已標明了它特有的性質；在其辦法第二條內，又明白規定了用途，以用於舉辦救濟事業以賑卹難民為限，而且負責當局又再三申明，所有捐得的款項，完全用於救濟，決不挪作軍政費用：那麽，它的性質和用途，完全屬於慈善性質，比較通常所辦水旱冬賑諸義捐，在範圍上，不過特別放大，中央和各地方，又不過特別鄭重其事而已。</p>
<p>同屬一樣義捐，何以此次範圍要特別放大？各方又何以要特別鄭重其事？這理由很明顯。就是八年抗戰，瘡痍遍地之餘，加上共匪狼奔豕突，到處荼毒，燒殺擄掠，慘極人寰，使匪區各同胞，不論男女老幼，貧富智愚，除了無法逃難以外，都不得不背井離鄉，相率流亡，以暫避其兇燄與毒手。所以今日難胞特別眾多，救齊特別急要，因而所需要的救　款項，亦特別廣大。還有國軍收復各區，經共匪恣意破壞以後，非但十室九空，衣食無着，而且生產工具如種籽耕牛等，亦已破燬掠奪，盪然無存。在這種赤　空拳，嗷嗷待哺之下，如果沒有大量的物資，從速運往，分別救濟，試思刧後遺黎，寗有生望？而且如許廣大地區的一切生產事業，又有何法可使它恢復得起來？現在上海，不是正鬧着原料恐慌嗎？物價雖然繼長增高，真正客銷，而實亦有限，內地的購買力，薄弱已極。倘使這種現象，日積月深，不能積極地予以蘇復，則工商界所需要的原料與燃料等，豈可一一求之於海外？其堆存的製造品，又豈可僅恃投機囤積為唯一之尾間？所以辦理救濟與卹賑，其意義不單是消極的，同時亦是積極的：其性質不單是慈善的，同時又是經濟的。徜以京滬等地，難民麕集，而加緊辦理賑濟，以暫免其饑寒，我們以為這還是祇看到得本問題的一面。</p>
<p>俞財長以為　項捐款，或將由各同業公會擬派。這攤派兩字，雖覺十分刺耳，但救人即是自救，在休戚相關，經濟並無界限過一點上看來，我們確希望各地　民自動的踴躍　將，以蘇息災區的元氣，即所以挽救經濟的衰落。至於那些富豪鉅室，達官　宦，在當局雖力主寬　，不願相逼太甚，阻人向善　但社會風氣，貴乎領導，貧富懸殊，尤伏危機，我　更切望他們率先解囊，共襄善舉，不讓古代的卜式弦高專美於前。</p>
<p>還有一點，必須向當局指陳的，就是遵理救濟與賑　，頭緒萬端，非可咄嗟立　，而救災如救火，又不容多兜圈子，稽延時日。所　救濟款項，在今日雖尚在籌募之中，而一切準備，不能不先行設計，以期迅赴事功。除掉經費與人事而外，諸如區域，對象，物資，運輸等等，均應統盤籌劃，作有系統的準備。固不宜稍涉浪費，重負一般善士之期望，亦不宜過於瑣碎，致落聊資點綴之舊套。良以此次募損，範圍較大，斯任務亦隨之而加重。記得本月五日，救濟特捐督導委員會，在行政院正式成立時，曾作只許成功，不許失敗的決定，我們以為此項決定，不僅適用於特捐之募集，亦應適用於救濟事業之舉辦。</p>

<p>（上按一版）李宗仁氏稱：副總統候選人若干人士，似有文武職或南人·北人之分，本人係一軍人，平日對政治亦極關懷，與文人亦極相親，故無文武之別，本人雖為南方人，但與北方人亦極相得，故亦無處域之分，就國際關係言，木人與美方及蘇聯方面友人均相處甚善，李氏解釋其宣布競選副總統為時最早之理由　：為倡導民主政治風氣，對候選人之提名，李氏認為如以民主原則言，應以自由競選為上。記者詢李氏何人為李氏競選之勁敵，李笑稱：無所謂勁敵且喜競選如打籃球，參加競選者有年高德　之老前輩，本人甚為佩服。記者詢以如渠獲當選副總統將如何　助大總統處理政務，李表示最近期內軍事為重要課題，此次戡亂工作，短則三五年，長則十年八年，本人平日對政治極為注意，將以個人心得貢獻未來之新政府。李氏並強調其協助新政府完成戡亂之信心。論及經濟問題，李氏認為在經濟嚴重關頭，如有　人出錢，有力者出力，即無問題。美國助我自有迫切需要，尤以軍事援助為甚，蓋吾人正以軍事保護人民也，吾人對友邦援助自表歡迎，惟自助者得人助，吾人仍應自力更生，自己靠自己。關於東北局勢，李氏稱：國軍在東北處於劣勢，共匪係以暴力政策以控制廣大幅員，吾人在東北僅保有數大據點，亟待增援，以　開展。至華北方面，國軍仍佔優勢，擁有廣大面積，共匪竄擾自在意中，但不致有何問題。最後李氏以幽默口吻稱：渠於當選　總統就職後，第一項措施即為男女平等，提高女權。</p>

<p>乙·軍事改革：（一）採精兵主義减少數量提高素質；（二）主要防禦綫應建築在經濟上；（三）以精兵固守點綫，抵禦敵方之襲擊，同時組織機動之精銳部隊分置若干重要交通點，以便隨時襲擊敵方主力，並馳援被襲之地區；（四）軍火以借貸方式取給於友邦；（五）軍餉以秘密捐獻方式，取給於少數富戶，俾免因籌措軍費而使通貨繼續無限制膨脹；（六）軍糧應僅向少數大戶徵借，不可再普遍增加一般平民之負擔；（七）徵兵應以軍事訓練之方式着重，於就地組織民眾加以訓練，增強自衛力量。丙·政治改革：（一）提桌公務員之待遇，同時保障其職拉；（二）起用新人才；（三）厲行憲法「軍人不兼文官」之規定；（四）過去政治着重於中央及省，而忽視縣鄉，是為捨木逐末，輕重倒置，今後應倡導「人才回鄉」運動，使最優秀之人才回到最基層去。</p>

<p>〔聯合社南斯拉夫京城廿三日電〕南斯拉夫外長薛米克昨日在記者招待會談稱，南斯拉夫政府凖備相互協商解決特里雅斯特問題，甚至不惜將特港交回義大利，惟須以其北面之戈用齊亞　劃歸南斯拉夫。先是，南斯拉夫政府宣布已向美英法提出强硬抗議，反對各該國提議將特港交回義大利所採用之方式，但照會中並未聲明接受或拒絕。舊米克則稱，南斯拉夫政府準备與加斯貝利領導之義大利現政府進行談判。</p>
<p>〔聯合社羅馬廿三日電〕外交部發言人今日宣稱，義大利堅決拒絕拒斯拉夫主張以戈里齊亞交換特里雅斯特。「義大利不能割裂本國之肉，以交換另一塊本國之肉」。</p>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓廿三日電〕美國外交當局今日拒絕南斯拉夫主張以戈用齊亞割歸南斯拉夫，件爲特里埃斯特交回義大利之交換條件。據國務部官員稱，特里埃斯特原不屬於南斯拉夫，以之交還義大利，非南斯拉夫所能借此討價還價。英美法三國對於南斯拉夫政府之意見，並不多大注意。西方三國上星期六提議以特港交還義大利時，曾以正式照會通知蘇聯及義大利兩關係國，並以照會副本送交南斯拉夫，不過為顧全外交禮節，供南斯拉夫政府參考而已。關於特港劃爲國際自由區之協定，南斯拉夫與之無關。南斯拉夫外長薛米克今次提議以特港交換戈里齊亞，與一九四六年義大利內閣所拒絕者同。西方三國對於南斯拉夫正式杭議及交換之議，均將加以拒絕。</p>
<p>〔路透社莫斯科廿二日電〕此間觀察家評述英美法建議特港歸還義國之事稱：蘇聯決不輕易放棄經用聯合國而取得的在特里埃斯特管理機構中之發言權。蘇聯嘗一再敦促迅速任命特港總督，蘇聯之政策以支援聯合國爲目的，決非在减少聯合國之責任。</p>

<p>〔合衆社特港廿二日電〕據盟國軍政府宣佈：南斯拉夫巡邏軍廿二日侵入特里埃斯特自由港之英美區，與警察發生機關槍戰，一警察受重傷。一南斯拉夫巡邏軍越過南境侵入英美區之特拉加，且「未發警告」即以機槍射擊一民警，該警回擊時，南軍即逃回，曾否被擊中未悉。此前軍政府當局曾宣稱，此區特港與南斯拉夫交界警察與南斯拉夫人民曾發生槍鬥，故南巡邏軍是否爲參預其間者，抑或爲另外發生之事件，目前亦未詳。英美法建議特港歸還義大利後，南特邊境極爲緊張，特港最主要之人民團體，特里雅斯特區委員會已電蘇外長莫洛托夫與聯合國安理會，請求同意歸還特港之建議，並組織代表團訪問英美佔區之英國司令愛萊，請其轉達特港人民對盟國政府之謝忱。特港市內尚無紛擾，然義大利人民到處狂歡慶祝，有自動放假而不工作者。</p>

<p>〔路透社成功湖二十二日電〕安全理事會今日以九票對兩票通過准許前捷克駐聯合國代表巴柏奈克參加安理會關於捷克局勢之討論，投反對票者爲蘇聯及烏克蘭。巴柏奈克遂在掌聲中就座。巴氏向安理會報告蘇聯及共產黨於戰爭結束前，即已開始破壞捷克民主之工作，共產黨之每一行動均爲以摧毀捷克民主生活，使捷克完全在外交上屈服於蘇聯之下爲目的。</p>
<p>巴氏於此並舉出如下之實例：（一）解放後捷克政府代表團爲蘇軍所阻不獲與喀爾巴什俄人接觸；（二）貝奈斯率顧問於一九四五年抵莫斯科時，共產黨竟强迫政府以重要職位給予共然；（三）在經濟方面，蘇聯已接管捷克之油鑛；（四）去年七月蘇聯迫使捷克退出馬歇爾方案。貝奈斯曾親自告彼，渠於一九四五年赴克斯科時，有一時期曾爲蘇軍使其不得與外界通訊，當時故外長馬薩里克正在舊金山，莫洛托夫竟多方恐嚇，告以如不採取與蘇相同的政策，蘇聯將與捷克絕交。巴氏復謂，貝奈斯總統已失自由，渠如有自由，當已辭職。巴氏請安理會邀貝奈斯來聯合國機構，證明渠係被迫而接受戈德于華之獨裁制。捷克共產政變之成功，將鼓勵全球尤其是歐洲的共產勢力，結果將引起暴動與衝突，故不能僅以內部事件視之·巴氏並謂，政變時捷京街頭之武裝民團中，雜有蘇聯間諜，目擊此等事實之證人，現已在倫敦及德國，且已來電願來安理會作證。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕上月廿六日本市金融管理局會同市警局查獲非法套匯商號四十一家，各號負責人經帶局偵訊後已先後交保釋出，惟帳册及資金則予凍結，以待審查。本市轉口商同業公會以該案牽涉屬會會員至多，特申述理由函請市商會主持公道，並迅速擬具有效辦法向該管當局交涉，先行解凍資金，略謂：「屬會會員素以轉口爲營業，受各地客商之委託。</p>

<h3 id="c112">自動電話接綫　微妙不可方物 <a href="#c112" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e112" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">112</a></h3>
<p>〔本報特寫〕近年來凡是日常使用電話的市民，差不多大家都經騐到打通電話的困難，尤其在中心區一帶的辦公時間以內，往往話筒拿起好久以後才能聽得到表軌聲。大家都知道這是因爲綫路擁擠的結果，回所謂擁擠，究竟又是怎麼一回事呢</p>
<p>昨天下午，上海電話公司招待各報記者參觀八仙橋接綫局與福建路接綫局，使我們對於電話通訊的過程，獲得些粗略的智識。</p>
<p>全上海現在共有六萬多條電話綫路（「〇二」不在內），這些綫路的銜接全用自動旋轉式機器。每一次電話從打出到接通爲止，要經過八種不同的機件，其過程猶如旅客坐火車，用尸體聽筒舉起，等於旅客走進火車站詢問往何處買票，此時有接行李者趨前服務，就等於自動機器中的覓綫機開始尋綫，幾秒鐘內該用戶就被覓綫機所尋得，並將其接入收發機，猶如脚夫領導旅客到售票處一樣。用戶與收發機接通以後，就可聽到嗡嗡聲，表示旅客可向售票處說明目的地，於是將所要之號碼由表盤撥出，收發機根據此五個號碼經由選擇機接到對方。這猶如火車站售票處按照旅客的意旨，代爲排就行程，經過若干月台而達到目的地。覓綫機收發機各有兩組，選擇機有四組，所以每次電話接通要經過八組機器。</p>
<p>由於設備限制　綫路常患客滿</p>
<p>由於目前設備的限制，每一百條電話綫由十四架覓綫機承受工作，假如在同一時間以內，有十四條綫路在通話，第十五條就打不通了。所以當你拿起話筒而聽不到表軌聲時，這就是說與你同組的一百條綫路中已有十四條綫把覓綫機佔據了，你必須耐心等候到其中一條綫空出以後才能候補上去。因爲戰後上海人口鉅量增加，電話費用比例的　廉，以及交通擁擠·經濟·金融情形混亂等種種因素，使得電話使用量大大增加。在中區一帶，平均每條綫路每天要使用二十次，（紐約電話綫平均每天七次），而現有的設備還是根據一九二六年平均每綫每天五次的標準裝置的，所以當然不够使用。換言之，每一百條綫路的十四架覓綫機時常全部「客滿」，這就是爲什麼打電話常常需要等候的原因了。</p>
<p>萬條綫路設備　一部陸續運到</p>
<p>電話公司現在正進行擴充設備，第一批向國外訂購一萬條綫路的設備與材料，已有一部份運到，並已在八仙橋接綫局的裝配工塲中開始裝配。這一批機器是美國國際電話電報公司法國分廠於戰爭期間在間在地下工廠內所製成，現尚在陸續遝來，大約須一年時間，才能全部裝好應用，將來的分配情形，大概八字頭一千具，九字頭五百具，六字頭四千餘具，四字頭二千餘具，其餘僅屬少數。去年該公司曾再增添一萬五千條綫路的定貨，但因外匯困難，短期內還不能進口，而據最近統計，向公司方面登記裝置電話的已達三萬餘戶之多。</p>
<p>忘將話筒掛好　綠色燈泡發亮</p>
<p>對於用戶的管制，機器的作用眞是微妙極了。任何一條綫使用一次，記錄機上就會轉過一個號碼，如用戶逾期不繳話費，祇要用一個揷頭揷住這一用戶的綫路，他就無法通話了。如果用戶使電話後忘將話筒掛好，監察機上該用戶綫路的綠色燈泡會發亮，如果話筒取下後，超過兩分鐘不撥號盤，就有白色的燈泡發亮，這時電話公司職員，就立即在綫路上通知該用戶，或者在該用戶的綫路上發出一種怪聲警告。</p>
<p>電話綫的包皮，現在已逐漸改用Pastie，即上海人所謂「玻璃」。這一種電綫的優點在於耐熱耐久，美觀而不漏電。不久的將來，所有電話綫當可全部改裝。</p>
<p>九七二二二號　準時催你蘇醒</p>
<p>在服務方面，除「〇一」的修理服務處，「〇九」的電話號碼查詢處，「〇〇」的緊急服務處，與「九五六七八」的時鐘報告服務處，已爲外界熟悉外，另有「九七二二二」的催醒服務處與代答服務處，凡用戶因搭乘飛機火車輪船或其他要公，必須於某日早起，而恐酣睡誤點時，可撥「九七二二二」預先通知，該服務處，可準時打電話催告起身，又如用戶因事全家出門，家中無人，接聽電話，亦可撥此一號碼告知，以後凡有人打電話來時，該服務處即可代爲接聽記錄，惟催醒服務全部義務，代答服務則酌收費用。</p>
<p>自動撥字機器　上海祇只兩架</p>
<p>除此之外，另有兩種新的設備。一種是自動接綫機，凡是分機多的電話用戶有這種機器後，可以不用接綫生。另一種是自動撥字機，可以自動撥出五十個號碼，這是供給那些經常通話次數多的人士使用，免去自己撥號的麻煩，這一種機器全上海祗有兩架，一架已經租出了。</p>

<h3 id="c113">流通券站得穩嗎？　一個爭執中的問題 <a href="#c113" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e113" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">113</a></h3>
<p>〔本報瀋陽廿日航訊〕財政部於二月十五日公佈東北流通券行兌換辦法後，各方看法不同，人言言殊。東北人的看法，都認爲弊多利少，因此擾擾不安。一國的幣制應該統一，特殊狀態遲早是要打破的，因爲內亂延長，使整理東北幣制的理想不能見諸事實，財政部公佈的這一個過渡性質的辦法，實未盡善美，筆者願盡愚忱，就流通券發行的某礎，動搖的因素，不同的立塲，新辦法的影嚮等項，提出一此觀感。</p>
<p>發行基礎</p>
<p>東北光復之後，實行流通劵制度問題，政府會予以愼重考慮，衡度當時情勢，關內外幣制隔離，可以保障東北人民生活程度較為穩定。另一方面，東北資源富饒，前途無限，關內外貨幣差額辟壘，有助於東北經濟事業的發展。歸納流通劵發行的基礎，約有三點：</p>
<p>（一）接收之初，有一百二十億元僞滿票流通市面，法幣與滿幣比值一時頗難　定，法幣出關必引起金融紊亂，乃發行東北九省流通劵，其與法幣匯率延至卅五年八月十六日由央行牌告，定爲一對十一元五角。</p>
<p>（二）蘇軍爲便於掠奪東北物資，在東北發行九十七億二千五百萬元的紅軍票（蘇方通知之數，一般人頗表懷疑）在我政府當局觀之，此種掠奪的工具應局限東北，加以整理，華北免受其害，禁止法幣出關，帶有經濟作戰的意義。卅五年八月底止，整理紅票告一段落。</p>
<p>（三）東北當時一般物價遠較關內穩定，面額龐大之法幣出關，勢將打破此種狀態，而致人民生活不安，有礙於政治經濟復員。　但是有遠見的人早就指出，東北是中國的一部分，特殊情形不能長期存在，在幣制方面，不如早使法幣出關，與流通劵同時使用，確定比率，逐漸收回流通劵，就整個立塲而言，這是很有理由的。</p>
<p>支援因素</p>
<p>在這兩年多的時間，，由於內亂破壞延續，不但使整理東北幣制的理想擱淺，並使流通劵的立足點不能穩固。就客觀環境而言，軍政開支浩繁，九省全部收復遙遙無期，交通斷絕，輸出不能，一切仰賴輸入。就人爲因素而言，匯兌管理不善，黑匯未能絕跡，流通劵充斥平津，黑市貶值，淪陷匪區的流通券，以低價套購收復區物資，這些因素已使流通券的信用動搖。同時，東北通貨膨脹的噩運，使民衆受到極大的震蕩驚嚇，印刷流通券的速度已不能適應如此浩繁的開支，增發通貨倍數，追不上物價上漲倍數。這種猛力打擊，使東北人民在心理上對流通券深惡痛絕，對以東北敵偽產業爲流通券的發行準備表示懷疑，對流通券發行的數字，也抱着「不相信主義」，這是一個秘密數字，東北請願團代表之一王化一在南京發表了五億萬的數字，此間行轅財務當局曾嚴格否認，據比較可靠的數字是五千億元，由東北籌碼缺少的情形看，五千億元較爲正確。這一個數字，與東北人相信的天文數字相差很遠。還有很多人杞人憂天，他們恐怕將來流通劵會和滿幣及紅票一樣遭遇不幸，因此全無信心，在熱要求改革幣制的浪花便由束北湧到南京。</p>
<p>不同立場</p>
<p>財政當局的觀點，不　成於此時改革東北幣制。張嘉璈先生對發行兩千元流通券大鈔問題會詳加研究，由此可見其處理財政問題之愼審，他們反對現在改革　理由很多，要爲下列數點。</p>
<p>（一）關內利率較高，游資充斥，一旦開放流通券的堤防，游資大　進關，對關內工商業顯屬不利</p>
<p>（二）法幣出關，東北通貨增加，　價不免更形激漲，而使一般人生活蒙受不利。</p>
<p>（三）鑒於兌換蘇軍票時所引起之金融市塲波動，法幣出關，匯率改定，必致一般民衆疑竇叢生。</p>
<p>（四）然論採用何種方式改革幣制，在過渡時期必先准予兩種貨幣同時使用，當初收復區以蘇車票代滿劵，雖整理大部完竣，其他未收復區中，蘇軍票尚待整理，滿劵以軍事關係，未能全部收回，如再使法幣流通，增加將來整理幣制的困難。</p>
<p>上述觀點，地方人士持相反見解者居多，他們說東北在國防前綫，獨力担負如此浩大的戰費是極不公允的，而且已到了無力負担的程度，流通券的日趨貶價，就是使東北人民的財產損失於無形，勢非馬上改革不可。</p>
<p>政府當局的立塲，着重以經濟學的觀點考慮幣制問題，地方的立塲，則滲透了政治感情來衡量它。財政是經濟與政治間的一座橋樑，二者融會貫通，實有賴於財政。所以在處理幣制問題上，應有遠大眼光，周詳的計劃，深刻的理解及豐當的經騐。</p>
<p>新的辦法</p>
<p>三月十五日財政部頒佈的新辦法，東北各省市參議會及民衆團體已正式表示反對態度。在地方人看來，限制流通券入關使用及兌換地點等規定，並沒有限制增發流通券，因此法幣出關，對東北物價及民生鮮少益處，同時法幣與流通券匯率改定爲一比十，流通券官價已經貶值，郵電等公用事業漲價就是一個很好的例子。</p>
<p>法幣出關及流通劵匯率改定的實際影響，當視中央銀行規定有關匯兌及兌換之詳細辦法後反應如何，此時還不宜衡論得失，但有三個問題值得注意：</p>
<p>（一）流通劵是否繼續發行？照實際情形看來，停止發行恐不可能，目前東北各地籌碼奇缺，以致公教八員薪金官兵薪餉都然法按時發給，運輸大批法幣來東北，困難頗多。</p>
<p>（二）流通劵黑市能否消滅？流通券在關內兌換既受嚴格限制，流入關內之大量流通劵只有走向黑市一途，假定東北匯兌放寬至最大限度，流通劵流入關內亦不能免，例如錦州以南的廣大地區就不通內匯，目前是北寗路僅通的一段，商業活躍，山海關北平兩地兌換，不能適應大量需要，黑市無法消滅，則流通劵官價貶價之後，黑市還要眨值。</p>
<p>（三）東北物價雖居全國高峯，法幣出關仍會予以有力刺激，自十五日以來，糧食紗布均扶搖直上，至爲顯著。</p>
<p>流通券成了一個爭執的問題。中央立塲與地方立塲，兩者顯然有對峙之勢，如不從根本整理幣制上着眼，兩種立塲是頗難接近的·總之，在東北軍事如此緊張的階段，爭執流通券的問題並無若何重大意義，實無置疑的餘地。（本報記者趙展）</p>

<p>〔本報海口十八日航訊〕瓊崖匪禍，不自今日始。據過去四十六軍公開發表之綏靖報告書所報道，遠在民國十六年時代，匪徒已開始在瓊島活動，迨十九年，匪勢益形活躍。廿六年，抗戰軍興，匪徒遂乘機編成「瓊崖民衆自衛團獨立隊」。廿八年二月，日軍登陸，匪徒遂將獨立隊改爲獨立總隊，得當時守備司令王毅准許，收繳瓊山，文昌，澄邁，定安各縣民衆槍枝，以及原有武裝，編成三個大隊，一個獨立大隊，一個特務中隊。廿九年四月，有匪徒一股四百餘人，皖南莊田竄至文昌附近登陸，自此匪勢力，日見龐大，積極擴充武力組織將總隊統屬之下編爲支隊，大隊，中隊等。卅二年後，匪徒已由三個支隊擴爲五個支隊。日軍降伏後，因我方尚未正式接收，地方上形成無政府狀態，匪徒又乘機活動，勢力繳增，各縣組成猛進大隊，獨立大隊等，每大隊由五百人擴至一千人，分散於鄉村中活動，縣以下組　區，鄉，保，甲及小組等。去年，匪軍奉令改編爲「中國人民解放軍瓊崖縱隊」，並同時設立「匪海南省民主政府」，由匪首馮白駒任司令兼省府主席。據華南通訊社消息：謂瓊島匪軍已計劃增編至十五支隊。但年來因被國軍不斷搜剿，匪方實力已日　削减。據由匪區逃出之民衆稱：共匪所用槍枝，多爲土製粉槍，足見其內部空虛。最近匪徒又爲掩飾其日趨敗亡跡象，分途向臨高崔縣竄擾，企圖製造恐怖，擾亂民心，惟經我軍予以重創後，匪已狼狽潰退。據淸剿部新聞組指出，其最終目的，不外搶掠物資，擾亂秩序而已。</p>

<p>兩道防綫　三大工程</p>
<p>川省防務綫，從川甘邊界的摩天嶺，沿米蒼山脈在達大巴山脈，這是川甘陝鄂毗界的大巴山國防綫。分成兩道守衛綫，守衛第一綫包括平武，靑川，廣元，昭化，南江，萬源，城口，巫山。第二綫包括北川，江油，劍閣，綿陽，彰明，蒼溪，儀隴，巴中，達縣，開江，宣漢，雲陽，奉節。在這兩條蜿蜒綿長的國防綫工，佈防工作是艱巨的，川省當局展開了動人的軍民合作，動員百萬民工：第一步搶修碉堡，一月之內，完成一千五百餘座，其中五十座是巨型連環式，堡與堡之間，有電訊，河道，運輸綫啣接，雄峙林立在大巴山脈。第二步構成公路網，搶修環繞川東北的大巴山弧形國防公路，計劃第一期工程，完成：（一）南（部）巴（中）綫，（二）萬（縣）開（縣）綫，（三）　（縣）南（江）綫三大綫，全長五八五公里。第二期工程，完成：（一）通（江）淸（江渡）綫，（二）廣（元）旺（蒼）綫，（三）梁（山）開（江）綫三綫，全長一九〇公里。現已分別由「大巴山國防公路勘測隊」進行勘測，並動員十萬民工實施工程。第三步佈署電訊，在兩道守衛綫　設防區內，構成專員區與專員區，縣與縣，鄉與鄉的在達電綫網，由廣元，達無，巴中三據點，修築全長二千四百餘公里的電綫路，經費列入本年度地方預算，已在積極搶修中。碉堡，公路，電訊，這是川防的物質防綫。</p>
<p>兩川人民一致動員</p>
<p>作爲川防的精神防綫，省政當局動員了兩川偉大無匹人力；第一步發動地方自衛遝動，首先在設防州縣，組織義勇警察隊與自衛大隊，逐次登記民槍，調查戶口，組訓民衆，十八歲至四十五歲的人民，一律編入自衛隊受訓，參加保鄉衛國工作。第二步實施國民義務勞動，動員近百萬民工，槍修碉堡，公路，電訊三大設防工程。第三步發動普遍知識靑年從軍運動，號召兩川熱血靑年，負起戡亂建國任務，初步每縣發動二百靑年入營，但現已超過實數。第四步動員各種專門人才，參加各項國防工程工作推動，省府最近特設「人才調劑協會」辦理此項工作。四川在抗戰中，貢獻無匹人力，創造光榮勝利，事食證明，現在的兩川同胞，再度接受了歷史任務，踴躍慷慨，爭先服役，要在抗戰建國史上，寫上光榮的第二頁。</p>

<p>川省當局實施的防務計劃：第一步各縣市普遍聯防，已實行者有一百二十縣，並成立了卅一個指揮部。全川實行四級自衛，省由保安總隊負責，行政專員區由保安大隊負責，縣與鄉鎮由警察負責，使各單位都有兵力靈活運用。第二步實施川陝甘三省聯防，這一點本月陝省府秘書長林樹恩來蓉，與鄧錫侯主席曾作具體商討，已擬有整個計劃，聯防各縣，計包括川省巴中，通江，陝省漢中，褒城，甘省西固，武都等廿七縣，劃爲川陝甘警備區。第三步配備武力與分劃防區，全川劃爲川東，川北兩警備區，川東以達縣爲據點，川北以廣元爲中心，分由方靖，黃隱兼司令，另廣元前進指揮所，負責統一指揮川北防務與軍政。武力方面，事關國防秘密，但一般人相信，除自衛隊與地方團隊等地方武力外，全川兵力，決不下八個師與十個保安總隊。第四步配合其他防務，空軍方面：聞中央將派××轟炸隊來川，華西基地則將爲××混合機羣駐用。防空方面：決恢復防空司令部，全川設重慶，萬縣，自貢，濾縣四指揮所。他如緊急征調商車，征借民間槍隻，以及最近省府登記航空，鐵路，電訊各種交通及其他工程專門人才，都顯示省政當局，對川防工作推動的決心與努力。</p>
<p>拒匪於外　安民於內</p>
<p>至於共匪窺川之勢，由於最近國軍嚴密佈置，加強壓力，形勢遂趨改觀。過去據傳劉伯承，陳賡，李先念，孔從周諸匪部均有竄川可能，但現在，劉伯承陳賡狼狽困頓於大別山，李先念局促喘息在　酋一隅，孔從周倉惶奔竄至陝　邊境一帶，自保不暇，何敢西竄？同時最近豫鄂川陝綏靖司令部的成立，對於川防安定，也具有最大作用。可是川省當局，決不因形勢和緩而佈防懈怠，因爲川省防務戰略是積極的，鄧錫侯主席宣示的「安民於巴山以內，拒匪於巴山之外」，即是這種戰略的最高原則。明顧祖禹方輿紀要論四川，首即爲四川防務下一定義「四川非坐守之地也」，並且指明：「以戰爲守，守必固。以守為戰，戰必强，守劍閣者，不以劍閣，守瞿塘者，不以瞿塘」。他說明佈防原則「設險以得人爲本，保險以智計爲先，人勝險爲上，險勝人爲下，人與險均，纔得中策」。當前四川設防工作，正是本諸這幾項原則推動，到今天，十萬雄師，構成了大巴山的銅牆鐵壁，兩川健兒，抱定消滅共匪於川省境外的決心，假如共匪竄犯，川人相信，崢嶸崔蒐的巴山劍閣，必是他們的葬身之地。（本報記者周學端）</p>

<p>〔本報台北十八日航訊〕合灣有唯一的光明之源——日月潭，十五年來放着有力的光，滋潤着工業，農田，帶給統治者以活力。可是新的時代要求，迫使人們認爲日月潭逐漸衰老，而重行投視到另一個新的偉大的電源，這就是大甲溪的水力發電。</p>
<p>配合着日人工業計劃，日月潭一五二〇〇〇瓩的發電量是無法負荷的，他們便以大甲溪寄託發展重工業原動力的遠景。不僅局限供應省內，而且可以通過台灣海峽輸流光明到福建。原來，日本人是抱着永久盤踞的野心和幻想的。</p>
<p>大甲溪處於合灣中部，流長一四二公里，發源於海拔逾三千公尺的次高山，有富甲全島的水力，計劃中以建造上游的達見高壩與達見蓄水庫爲樞紐，自達見以下到下游的石岡莊附近六十餘公里問，利用一二〇〇餘公尺的巨大落差，連續設立八個發電廠，綜合發電量是四五八五〇〇瓩，因爲達見水庫的調節流量平穩，經常發電量有三二一〇〇〇瓩，它可以負荷發展重工業的主要力量，同時還可担當防洪，給水，灌溉水田九萬八千市畝的任務！</p>
<p>日本議會於一九四二年二月以日金一億二千五百萬的龐大數字，通過了建設蓄水庫的預算，終因器材缺乏，財力不够，降低建築水準仍不能避免工程的頓挫，而使改變計劃在一九四三年完成了明治公路，鋪築自豐原到東勢的鐵路。而由台電建設的天冷，豐原第一，明治等三個發電所，也遭遇到同一命運，其中天冷一廠的土木工程且已完成了百分之八十。</p>
<p>台灣電力公司現在以僅須完成五分之一的土木工程，交給省工程公司來執行。三十五年九月，這待完成的工程，估計約需合幣二億一千餘萬元，現在則需一百億以上（機器等約需一千萬美金）這不能不說是個大數目，這一椿偉大的工程，時間把工程身價提高。目前工程公司決定進行的第一期工程，是所有十一條燧道，（共十公里一百公尺，）中最長的第八號燧道，這條引水道三公里一百公尺中，三分之一，日本人做完了二分之一，却需要接收這遺產者加以完工。在已完工的下口一公里，平時就水深沒脛，一到雨季，便成泛濫，工程異樣艱鉅，而中間被倒坍了的，却待重新建築。工程公司認爲這並不是技術上的難題，而是彎力公司是否具有充足的資金，而能在目前開工以後的三年或五年間全部完成的把握。</p>
<p>這個工程的準備姿態，早已完成，工程公司且於上月間派工程師前往實地踏勘，要是這個偉大結實的工程，能迅速開工，我們當能感謝美國雷諾鋁公司，因爲它和鋁業公司的合作，迫使電力公司不能不儘量供給全省最大的顧客，惟其如此，大甲溪發放出較日月潭增强三倍以上的光芒，實是台灣重工業建設的起步！</p>

<p>〔本報重慶十六日航訊〕跨入了巍峨的通惠銀行的大樓，訪晤我們的金融界的朋友——鄧華民先生。鄧華民這個名字，可說是不大陌生了，因爲他是參政員，新任四川第七區立法委員，通專實業銀行，四川盬業公司，春茂發木公司的董事長，自在德國漢諾夫爾工科大學畢業後，即返國祖任國立四川大學的教授，旋即創辦這些事業，由經理，總經理，以迄董事長，達到了現在的地位。</p>
<p>這位靑年金融家，中型個子，身體結實，面孔紅潤，整潔的服裝並不顯得如何的富麗，不過從舉動上與言辭上，却顯示出了他的簡樸與精明來。記者首先徵詢他對於重建西南的意見。他低下頭去嚴肅地沉思，接着說：『談起重建西南，還是狹小塊說吧，我是四川人，就談建設四川，首先就有三個基本的問題：第一是資金籌集問題，第二是建設重點問題，第三是技術人才問題。四川本來就是一個經濟相當落後的地方，現在所有的工礦業，乃是適應戰時的需要而發達，並不是慢慢生長的，所以，勿論原料和市場，勿論按術和人才，雖是天府之國，且有豐富的資源，而實際都還沒有培植起自力自主的基礎，固然，我們並不否認四川工礦業的本身，和其他週遭的經濟環境上，是存着若干缺點的，建設四川，實是一種大的工程，殊非一人一地之努力所能奏效，而必須是：</p>
<p>第一，我們要督促輔助政府去完成偉大的五年建設計劃。</p>
<p>第二，政府應該扶持現在四川的優秀工廠。</p>
<p>第三，政府應該優待抗戰時一般的遷川工廠。舉例來說，現在日本對我的賠償物資，已臻具體階段，分配數字，分配地區，雖尚未見諸公佈，究將如何分配公平，並如何求其克收實效，這是我們西南工礦業應該也是必須注意的問題。』最後，他又提及美國有個時期發起過一種西進運動，他說：『四川的重建，不但沒有西進運動時的障礙，而且有西進運動听缺乏的優越條件，因爲人力物力財力秉着戰時所有的經濟基礎，這是事半而功倍的。』（愼時）</p>

<h3 id="c171">銀根復緊店胃呆滯　米價昨繼續下跌　民調會在北市場拋售竟無人申購 <a href="#c171" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e171" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">171</a></h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕昨米市因銀根復告緊迫，上日蘇錫產地價格又均報降，遂亦展開猛烈跌風。早開時約挫十餘萬，本街巡胃頗呆，貨主非抑價難招顧主。後市業外各貨俱報小，人心更不振，幾呈有供無求之局面。南北二市白粳及早萍稻各降二十萬元，後市亦有較上日低卅萬者。北市塲白粳三百七十五萬，薄稻三百六十五萬，特高粳亦退入四百萬關內。到貨南北二市共計七千二百七十五石。</p>
<p>又訊：民調會爲抑平米價漲風，昨日繼續大量拋米。原定在北市塲拋出早稻，嗣因米價回小，當自動將拋售價壓低二〇萬，爲三四〇萬元。但終以人心不振，申購無人，致無粒米拋出。按民食調配會自開辦全面計口配米以來，從未在市塲拋售食米。近以倉庫存米儲運過久，並以新到一百卅四船載來之米，有一部份不宜久儲，並經檢查有一千二百卅五石，略有潮濕，該會乃將此項食米，委託北米市塲管理委會拋售。昨日竟因米價下跌過鉅，臨時未能拋出。又悉，本市四六兩月份配售之米，將全爲美國救濟洋米。五月份配米，則爲暹米。據該會負責人稱：糧源超過需要，現正擬訂辦法，以便直接護售，而免糧價暴跌云。</p>
<p>麺粉客銷不動，本街納胃减弱，在賣聲不絕下，各牌粉跌進限度以內。老車·兵船各猛落十一萬五千元，紅蜂·建成亦均小十一二萬元，雜牌粉因銷稀交寂，收市老車棧單一百四十七萬五千，送到一百四十九萬，兵船棧單一百四十六萬元，大包麩皮跌入八十萬內，計小七萬五千。小麥廠盤二百卅萬。</p>
<p>雜糧一片跌聲，由於米價下跌在前，雜糧均跟踪下降。黃豆客帮不辦，漢口乍豆開一百九十萬元，收市大昌新油廠殺價至一百八十五萬元，成交三百包，計跌二十萬元。苞米上日上漲雖猛，昨日下跌亦慘，勁跌二十餘至卅萬元。紅糧亦降二十萬元，菉豆芝蔴均小二十萬，生仁廣帮更少納胃，再傾落卅至四十萬元。</p>
<p>食油價格傾瀉，實因黃豆因其他雜糧一致均降，人心至爲虛軟，在銀根再度抽緊下，貨主更不得不抑價求脫，跌勢既盛，本街反多觀望，市乃一路疾瀉。靑島吉桶生油由九百廿五萬開市，後降至九百十萬元，猛落五十萬之鉅。簍生油八百六十五萬有少數成交，豆油大有廠以七百六十五萬開出，後回籠貨直小至七百五十五萬元。大統豆油開七百六十萬，回籠低至七百五十萬元，各降四十五萬元。生蔴油跌四十五萬，生菜油初跌卅萬，後市續低。小車蔴油下跌最少，計小卅萬。豆餅客帮不納，散戶川籠，繳降四五萬元</p>

<p>後市永紗開盤一八〇〇元及一八六五元，夜報有援華案通過之訊，紅紗賣到一八四五元，旋現遞經吸納而升爲一八五〇元及一八八五元，中途雖回而有盤，後以謠傳張院長辭職下台之說，人心一虛，加上國行差進四千多億，跌至一七八〇元及一八〇五元。收市爲一七八五元及一八一〇元，較晨收即交股計火柴榮豐中絲永公景福勤興內衣微升，華新商務平平，餘均微降，遞交股一致下降少許，塲外各未上市股票以公用股跌半成爲最疲。</p>

<p>外股銀根迫人，銀行帮大量殺出，證券帮出後有進，洋行帮有買，仍難振作。怡紗晨開一八四萬，前市尚盤，不過微降至一八五萬內外而已。後市則再告不支，退至一七三萬左右結束。較前收計橡皮股及英聯微挫，航業怡啤鋼業各跌一成，怡紗會德豐紙版業廣各降半成。</p>

<p>香港航訊，關於開放自備外匯問題，此間接獲滬市消息，輸管總會定期在滬舉行委員會議，財政部長俞鴻鈞並赴滬參加，會議主要爲討論自備外匯部份開放問題，以運用國人在國外存款及便利華僑匯款，輸入坐產器材及國內所需工業原料，化學用品·此項辦法主要在利用國人在外國存款，及引導逃避國外資金，使國內增加生產。惟規定此項自備外匯以去年十二月底以前國外存款爲限，始得援用輸入，藉以防止資金外流，及擾亂金融市塲。詳細辦法，尚在擬訂中。記者昨曾以此問題叩詢此間各商業領袖，照彼等意見，自備外匯輸入，對本港商塲將無實際利益。因所謂自備外匯者，約有下列兩個來源：（一）僑匯，（開香港不列入範圍內）（二）出口結匯，關於僑匯方面，外地僑胞，尤其美匯，匯款回國，多直接將美金單匯寄返台，然後轉來香港存儲。彼等對國幣港幣均無信心，故鼓勵僑匯輸入生產器材，將來是否可達到預期效果，頗屬疑問。而且上海消息謂限於去年十二月底以前國外存款，在證明上尤多麻煩。至於出口結匯，除百份之二十結售政府，百份之七十則由商人自由支配。</p>

<p>上海市搪瓷工業近以舶來原料缺乏，限額分配數量又小，以致產銷衰落，前途暗淡。茲復因國產純銻與銻白配價，暴漲不已，影嚮輸出，亦非淺鮮。特具呈資源委員會，請求特別减低，並增加配量，以維生產。原呈略謂，純銻爲搪瓷工業必需之重要化學原料，本會所屬各廠，月需四十餘噸。自上年八月開始配售以來，初次蒙配半數，價爲每噸七百五十萬元。嗣後幾經請求，至十一月份又蒙二次配售四分之一，價已暴漲爲三千五百萬元。未越兩月，第三次之配價，又提高至四千六百萬元。迨最近二月十六日第四次配售時，突又漲至七千三百萬元。在此六閱月之中，其第一次之配價與第四次比較，竟漲達十倍之多。第五次雖尚未配出，聞飛漲更爲驚人，已達一億餘元。但同時期內搪瓷成品之售價，遞漲猶不滿三倍，其虧損之鉅，概可想見，復查四次所配得之純銻數量，總計僅佔實需數之五分之一。且前接國外貿易事務所函，以關於搪瓷工業需用純銻，應逐步改銷銻白，囑促各廠力圖改進云云。當以銻白配價，比純銻尤高，不足以示鼓勵。如能配量减低，自應諄勸各廠購買試用等語函復去後，迄今杳無消息，而再漲之聲，反接踵而至·各廠僉以改用銻白，旣嫌發光暗淡，影響成品美觀。且其用量較諸純銻須增耗百分之三十，雖智利硝可以少用若干，但硝價較廉，所得實不償所失。再就產量而言，以純銻配製瑯粉，每　可日產二百磅以上，若用銻白，則不足一百八十磅。故其結果，將促使製品成本增鉅，而自塞外銷之路。請求對於銻白配價，特別减低，至少須照二月份之定價酌减百分之三十，藉利改進。又下屆配售純銻，並請增加數量，及維持上一次之原價，勿再暴漲，以維生產而利輸出云云。</p>

<h3 id="c193">戲劇與文學 <a href="#c193" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e193" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">193</a></h3>
<p>—</p>
<p>從事戲劇必須有豐實的文學修養，因爲戲劇是離不開文學的。我們知道文學的主要部門是詩歌，散文，小說，戲劇；戲劇原屬於文學一部門，但戲劇却又消化了文學的其他部門；因爲戲劇的本身就是詩歌，散文，小說組成的，戲劇立體表現了詩歌，散文，小說，所以戲劇固可謂之爲綜合的藝術，也可謂之爲綜合的文學。</p>
<p>戲劇無論樂劇，話劇，和詩歌都有密切關係。而詩歌既能單獨構成樂劇，也可以點綴或調劑話劇的氣氛，如插曲。莎士比亞用詩歌寫對話，中國的初期話劇，像田漢的「蘇州夜話」，不但對話是詩，連情節氣氛都是詩的。</p>
<p>散文也是一樣，散文可以運用於戲劇的對話意境。散文是着重辭藻美，情緒美的一種文學體裁，因此散文寫得好的人，寫戲劇的對話一定漂亮，設造背景，氣氛也一定細微。</p>
<p>小說與戲劇聯繫得更緊，小說能蛻變爲戲劇，因爲小說和戲劇一樣有對話，情節，人物，動作。分別只是在於戲劇凸出表現，小說乃平面描寫。有了寫小說的基礎，寫戲劇就方便得多。</p>
<p>以上是說戲劇創作者須有文學的修養，即如戲劇導演，演員，也同樣須有文學的修養。因爲文學能修帮助你增高理解力，理解一句台詞應當如何唸誦才諧調；一個人物的性格應當如何表現才入情，才靈活；一段情節應當如何穿插才恰當；才合理。</p>
<p>一個有文學修養的劇作者，所寫出來的戲劇，不僅是適於演出的脚本，也是能讀的文學作品。一個有文學修養的導演，所排練出來的戲劇，格調必然高。一個有文學修養的演員，所表演出來的戲劇，一定沒有油腔，矯揉的弊病。</p>
<p>所以，凡是戲劇工作者，都要有相當的文學修養，哪怕是弄佈景，效果，燈光的人，也不能例外。因爲文學同機帮助你理解一堂佈景應該如何設施才能協調劇情；一個效果應該如何運用才能充實情緒；一支燈光應該如何放射才能配合氣氛。</p>
<p>致於怎樣培植文學的修養，除了充分的閱讀文學晝籍之外，一個劇作者，尤其必須多多從事文學習作。</p>
<p>閱讀文學書籍，不能存消遣的心理，也不能中綴。要認眞地；有恒地；甚而系統地鑑賞每個時代；每種主義；每個作家的作品。鑑賞出了作品的好壞，然後再用研究的態度去分析作品，分析作者。末了，便嚴格地批評，因爲批評別人的作品無異是警惕自己，鼓勵自己。本着這種閱讀精神，不禁直接帮助增高文學修養，而且提起了濃厚的寫作興題。</p>
<p>欲成爲一個優秀的劇作者，最好試驗寫各部門的文學作品，比如詩歌；比如散文；比如小說。特別多寫小說，寫短篇的小說奠定寫獨幕劇的基礎，因爲　篇小說情節節單，可以變成獨幕劇。寫長篇小說奠定寫多幕劇的基礎，因爲長篇小說的情節複雜，可以變成多幕劇。小說和戲劇雖然形式不同，素質實在是一樣的。</p>
<p>自然，我們不能絕對說一個戲劇工作者沒有文學修養便成功不了，他可以靠技術的熟練而成功。但，僅靠技術成功的戲劇究竟缺意味，少分量。如果在技術之外並重文學，那麼既可以補充意味的貧乏，又可以加重分量。尤其戲劇寫作，是要經過文學各部門的薰陶，也是文學的各部門組合成功的。因此我們敢絕對地說一個戲作者必須有充分的文學修養。</p>

<p>插圖本格林童話集</p>
<p>一九四六年六月蓋格（Wan　ａGag）女士逝世了，她留下了她的「格林童話續選」（More　Tales　from　Grimm）。</p>
<p>孩子們看慣了她所畫的貓和兔，對於她是非常熟悉的。孩子們從心底裘喜愛她所插繪的書，再來傳給別的孩子們；這樣她是永生了！</p>
<p>什格羅索（Zigrosser）的序言，說她「在這本書出版以前，是經過痛苦的忍耐方纔完成這工作」的。她的插圖並不因襲前人，是她自己的創作。只看這裏所附的一張有名的「小妖與皮匠」就可以知道。這些撟圖是極富於想像力和幽默的。</p>
<p>她的「格林童活選」出版於十一年前。這一本「續選」只有一篇「龍與他的祖母」比較生疏。其他都是男女兒童所熟知的，可以打動任何年齡的兒童的回憶和喜悅·其中如德國異式的「睡美人」和「六隻大　」，謝德羅　（Marie　Sherlock）所重述過的「狼和七复小山羊」（這種重述在美國曾經使得中年人大笑），還有「獻漢斯」是可愛的　　故事「牧童的花束」（The　Sheperd＇s　No　　gay）的異式。</p>
<p>拉綺洛孚的童話</p>
<p>瑞典女小說家拉綺洛孚（SehnaLagerlof）的童話「尼爾斯漫遊奇憶記」（The　Wonderfal　Aluentureof　nils）新近已有英譯。</p>
<p>這本書是供給端典小學的孩子們自然研究的材料，學校課本很少有像這本　這樣受歡迎的。這本　作於一九〇三，出版於後三年。其中有　百幅插圖，尤為名貴。</p>
<p>尼爾斯是一個　孩子。他已經十四歲，不　讀書，心腸又壞，對於動物尤　　待。因此一個小妖把他也變成一個小妖，比他所虐待過的小動物還要小。現在他要受小動物的憐憫了！他經過瑞典各地的田園，古堡，城池，大廈等等。這時他　懂得林中動物的生活，也懂得怎樣做人。終於，他爲了禽鳥而肯犧牲，因好心而重變為人。</p>
<p>這故事是用連環圖畫的方式表達出來的。這本書使得眼睛和心靈同樣的受用。</p>
<p>這本書是　松（Pantheon）書店出版的，該書店每年必出一種兒童文學名著，過去曾出過德國，蘇聯和希臘的故事和傳說。今年所出的這一種也是我們渴欲一讀的。</p>

<h3 id="c196">清代繪畫之特徵 <a href="#c196" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e196" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">196</a></h3>
<p>— 俞劍華</p>
<p>—並預祝三十七年美術節</p>
<p>（一）時代的劃分</p>
<p>在歷史上的淸代，係自甲申順治元年（一六四四）起，至辛亥宣統三年（一九一一）止，共計三百六十七年，可以成爲一個獨立的時代，但在繪畫史上，以　派的嬗變，與畫風的轉移來看，應該從明代隆慶萬歷年間起，到淸代嘉慶二十五年止，作爲一個時代，因爲這個時代繪畫的主流是山水，而山水的作風，完全繼承董其昌的方法，一直到清朝中年都沒有改變，在明淸之際，雖然有許多畫壇怪傑，超出於董派勢力以外，如石濤，石溪，八大，半千，瞿山，漸江等，在當時固然各據一方，有相當勢力，但亦不過如群雄割據，不久澌滅，繼起無人，蔓延不廣，董其昌以後，所謂淸代六大家的四王吳惲，無不繼承董法，發揮光大，造成畫壇統一局面，所以言淸代繪畫者，往往以石濤八大等人歸諸明末遺民，而以四王吳惲爲淸代的代表作家。其間婁東虞山二派繁延尤盛，與淸代的太平治世相終始。道咸以後，清代多故，國勢漸衰，而四王吳惲的　派，亦隨之衰敗不堪，清未亡而四王　派已亡，雖有作者，亦等於遺民逍老之流，無足輕重了。</p>
<p>（二）清書的根源</p>
<p>四王吳惲六大家既都繼承董其昌的作風而稱覇於清代，所以董其昌可以說是淸代繪畫的父親，其間六大家也微有不同，王時敏王　王原祁三人可以說是親生子，（這是以　派論，實在王原祁是王時敏的孫子）而王石谷惲南田可以說是堂侄，吳墨井可以說是族侄，那麼董其昌的父親是甚麼人？那就是元代四大家之一的黃子久，董其昌在文沈唐仇四大家極盛以後，由於顧正誼的介紹，專學子久，又參以遠祖米南宮董北苑的墨法，形成一種溫厚秀潤，文雅優美的獨特作風。三王繼之，遂向子久討生活，麓臺一生，竟未敢軼出子久範圍的一步，琉風所被，竟成「人人一峯」，「家家大癡」，以爲子久以外無畫，子久以外之畫，盡係旁門外道，絕不可學·所以自隆慶到淸末這四百多年的畫壇，也可以呌「黃子久時代」。</p>
<p>（三）政治的影響</p>
<p>滿淸入關，統一中國，武力雖盛，文化幼稚，典章制度，大抵衍襲明代矩範。及至康熙乾隆時代，獎勵文學，整飭政治，東征西討，威力大震，造成淸代全盛的局面，政府爲閉塞思想，收攬人心計，召集文學博雅的遺老，編纂四庫全書等大部書籍，百年之間，以政治修明，社會安寗，才智之士，亦漸忘其亡國之痛，而優游熙樂於太平化澤之下，所以一切的詩文書畫，務爲純雅調和，至於發揚踔厲，奇拔突兀，富有刺激性的作風，已日漸軟化而毫不可見。加以在上帝王如批祖聖祖高宗等英主，均雅好書畫，就是仁宗宣宗文宗，雖丁內憂外患交迫的時代，而萬幾之暇，亦常流連書畫，上行下效，風聲所樹，故一時社會習氣，均從事揮洒，以期附庸風雅。畫家之多，爲歷代之冠，帝王既好　，雖無畫院之設，却有內廷供奉，內廷祗候及如意館等名目，以優待畫家，在上者好之旣深，倡之又力，所以一般畫家，雖不必有意趨榮赴勢，然利祿所在，茍邀睿賞，就可以煊赫一時，所以就不免有人赴之若鶩。就是一般的文人學士，也多舞筆弄墨，以投時君之好，而爲進身之階。康熙帝尤好董其昌的書畫，搜羅海內，玉牒金題，極爲重視。王原祁秉承家學，官至司農，尤受聖祖之知，充書畫譜館總裁，總繪南巡圖，於是學畫者爭趨其門下，形成所謂婁東派，與虞山派對抗。原祁一生專工子久，學之者更不敢稍有變更，於是原祁的門生遍天下，而子久的；法也就遍畫壇了。</p>
<p>（四）思想的復古</p>
<p>明末遺民如顧炎武等痛形式擬古學術的空疏無用，力倡經世致用的學說，援古證今，遂啓考據學的風氣。淸初帝王也利用這種弊精竭神，追古忘今的學問，以消耗固閉學者的聰明才力，所以一時朝野均崇尚訓詁考證的漢學，代主張性理的宋學而執學術界的牛耳，因考古風氣的興盛，而復古思想亦因之大爲發展。以爲世間一切，凡古必佳，而且愈古愈好。文人學士既受此種子術風氣的影嚮，從事於繪畫，自然惟古是崇。不敢自作聰明，不敢自抒機杼，不敢自標新奇；只有崇拜古人，摹倣成法，只要貌似古畫，便已沾沾自喜，以能得「古人脚臭氣」，或能「與古人一鼻孔出氣」，僞然自足。臨摹的風氣，瀰漫全國畫界，臨摹以外無法，臨摹以外無畫。結果便成了一陳陳相因」「每下愈况」，枯槁，空疎，平庸，陳腐，造成了淸畫的不治之症。</p>
<p>（五）花鳥畫的派別</p>
<p>清代山水畫的主要派系，總不出王原祁的婁東派和王石谷的虞山派，至於花鳥畫方面，却沒有山水畫派系的簡單·淸代花鳥畫的勢力，雖不及山水的偉大，但是較之其他各畫，如道釋人物等則頗有生氣。（一）寫生——對花寫生，不事稿本，師趙昌易元吉的寫生方法，此派人數雖有數十，但無煊赫有名的大家，故勢力不很。（二）王武——位置安穩，賦色明麗，在清初頗爲人所宗仰。（三）惲南田——逸才天縱，斟酌古今，以北宋徐祟嗣為宗而創純沒骨體，淸秀妍雅，工整艷麗，於姿態生動之中，尤富氣韻書卷之趣。遂爲花卉畫正宗，學者極衆，號爲常州派，爲淸代花卉畫的主派。（四）蔣廷錫—有南沙派之號，筆墨較南田爲厚重規矩，或奇或正，或賦色，或墨暈，均能融和自然。官階又高，門下亦衆，可與南田分庭抗禮。（五）鄒一桂—設色明淨，筆墨秀雅，迎風含露，婀娜如生，爲南田後僅見的名手。（六）鈎花點葉派—此派本創於明代的周之免，介於工筆寫意之間，淸代半工半寫的畫如孫克宏張若靄等。（七）寫意派—此派由於明代林良徐渭陳淳的水墨寫意而來（八）揚州八怪—如金農，羅聘，高鳳　，李　，黃愼，鄭燮等人，成爲布衣，或爲卑官，各肆其奇，別開生面，其中雖不盡在花卉畫家，然均有相同的趨向。當時稱他們爲怪，實由於他們作風與四王正統派不同所致，現在觀他的畫，却不覺其怪了。（九）華嵓—以縱逸駘宕之筆，淸疏淡雅之氣，遂爲淸代後斗期花鳥　的宗匠。然其筆力不免過於柔弱，習之者流於瘦軟。趙之議吳廷　等乃以厚重馳騁救之，到了極端，又變爲吳俊卿的粗豪，而淸社已屋。</p>
<p>（六）異軍的突起</p>
<p>（甲）寫景畫家　在淸朝臨　全盛的時代，凡屬大家，俱以臨摹爲工，學者便之，亦不敢自異，雖有一二傑出的人才，從事實景寫生，亦不爲世人所重，所以石多彰，然畫史所載，頗不乏人。如方咸亭足迹幾遍天下，所見無非粉本，黃鼎閱盡天下名山，法若眞善寫黃山，洪髯寫天台雁蕩，戴本孝畫華山，而孝子黃問堅萬里尋親，歷盡蠻荒，所見奇景怪峯，盡收筆底，尤爲傑出。（乙）指畫　高其佩劍以指作畫的方法，花卉人物隨手揮洒，爲畫苑獨創一格，學者亦很多。（丙）西畫　畫東漸雖始於明，而西洋畫家郎世寗艾啓茶之來東土，影嚮始大，以精工細緻，唯妙唯肖的西法作折衷派的中畫，一時學者甚多，如焦秉貞，冷枚，唐岱，陳枚，羅福旻，丁元泰，張恕等，均以西法著稱，此種畫法雖流行一時，不久即歸銷沉，直至淸末民初，西畫始又抬頭，但與郎世寗時代的畫又絕不相同了。</p>
<p>（七）結語</p>
<p>上海市立美術館籌備處舉行淸代畫展，適逢本屆美術節開幕，謹草此短文以誌慶祝。（三十七年二月二十九日）</p>

<p>— 陸丹林</p>
<p>去年秋間，上海市美術館籌備處，舉行「近百年內已故名家畫展」，參觀的多感到是近年來很有意義的美術展覽。閉會以後，同人等即接續的籌備淸代繪畫展覽會。這兩個畫展，都是劃時代的，尤其是淸代畫展，他的空間和時間都比「百年畫展」的領域加增一倍。時期是在淸初而至道光，作者不限於是否寄居在上海，故他的範圍比較廣遠，無疑的，他的作品也就蛟前豐富了。</p>
<p>在淸代繪畫，除了末期一部分曾經在「百年畫展」陳列不再重複的之外，其中值得提出的派別，如金陵八家的龔賢·樊圻·高岑·鄒喆·吳宏·葉欣·胡慥·謝蓀·海陽四大家的查士標·孫逸·汪之瑞·弘仁。畫中九友的董其昌·王時敏·王鑑·李流芳·楊文驟·程嘉燧·張學曾·卞文瑜·邵彌。在畫中九友，其中又別出山水六大家，即王時敏·王鑑·王　·王原祁·吳歷·惲壽平。由王原祁又別爲婁東派，王　爲虞山派，兩派並峙，各有面目。乾隆嘉慶以後而至現在的山水畫家，多給此兩派所範圍，他們的勢力，可說是廣遠雄厚。畫中十哲的董邦達，張　翀，李世倬，王允禧，高翔，高鳳翰，李師中，王延格，張士英，陳嘉樂。揚州八怪的金農，羅聘，鄭燮，李蟬，汪士愼，李方膺，高翔。（也有把閔貞，高鳳翰而和其他人增减的）其他還有蘇松派，華事派，雲間派，新安派，江西派等，各有領域。更有專工一藝，如不屑臨摹，專工靑綠，摹仿荊浩關仝，臨墓宋元明，道釋人物，仕女寫眞，花鳥草蟲，禽獸雜畫等，在此期間，各搜其勝。除了淸代末期任頤，吳俊卿的一派與嶺南畫派外，淸代繪畫的各宗派，最爲燦爛，連接百年畫展的作品，可以作劃時代的欣賞與研究。從此也可以探溯元明畫的流風餘韻，海派畫的發生的由來，各派各家的淵源與演變，在此畫展都可以領略鑑賞得到。而在若干作品中，更可以見到滿淸政府的標榜文治，提倡繪事，用內廷供奉，內廷祗候等職銜來籠絡畫人·而有些畫人也趨炎附勢，利祿所在，不惜降志辱身，揮毫弄墨，博邀「睿賞」。石渠實笈所著錄的多不是繪畫專家，而是好名博祿的士大夫。故此欣賞歷史性的藝術，也可以探討某一時代某一階層人們的思想與品格的了。</p>

<p>稽諸上古，繪畫一道，旨在實用，審美次之。密虞三代秦漢之世，往往利用繪畫藻飾器物，用宏教化。漢末六朝，中國畫受印度佛教畫之導發，產生輝煌煒麗之宗教畫。降至盛唐，老莊佛學以及詩文之勃興，繪畫轉而講筆，墨，尚氣韻，開文人畫之先聲。至是而五代宋元諸家，皆力求寫意，妙筆神品，多宗山水。下至明淸之際，追摹成風，而與文人畫相終始矣。</p>
<p>有淸歷朝，以倡導繪畫之故，海內七人，研精書畫，用備供奉。當時宰相侍從，以能畫受殊寵者，頗不乏人，登高一呼，四方響應，繪畫之盛，媲美前代，其流派紛衍，最著者爲釋浙江之新安派，羅收之江西派，　尺木之姑蘇派，王煙客之婁東派，王石谷衍而爲虞山派，而虞山派為當時盟主，籠單淸代後半世紀。傳流較　者，有董香光之華亭派，趙文度之松江派，各派之中力事復古者，其畫格溫潤靜穆。力事創新者，其畫格淸新放逸。尤以明末遺民，另關蹊徑，寓家國之恨於筆墨之間，鬱勃不平之氣逼人，形成淸季繪畫之殊風，而影嚮後代至鉅。</p>
<p>歷代繪畫名作，以藏於內府者為最，清室尤廣事搜求，按之內務部古物存列所書畫目錄，可資佐證。當時仕宦續紳之家，收藏古畫者，不勝枚舉，然皆深藏秘錮，成爲私有獨享之物，以致有關民族文化之繪畫，無由供大衆研究，使文化頓形停滯。茲值科學進步之際，人類距離，因交通便利而縮短，古今文物，因印刷術之優美而轉佈較易，各種學術，繁榮滋生，個人與社會，交蒙其利，民初以還，歷代繪畫上有國家提倡，下有地方人士贊助，繪畫乃有公開展覽之機會，以供肚會同好，俾便觀摩欣賞，故使奄奄一息之藝術生命，復穫昭蘇。</p>
<p>上海市美術館籌備處，前曾舉辦近百年畫展，頗獲社會人士好評，茲乃溯源而上，舉辦淸代畫展，旨在提倡繪畫，推行美育，蓋所以挽澆薄之世風，啓文化之新運。而上海爲國際文化交流之門戶，以中國之文物，供國際人士之鑒賞，則其意義，豈僅提倡藝術已哉！</p>

<p>— 綠蒂</p>
<p>冒着刺骨的風，密飛的雪，一我到了雕刻家劉開渠兄家裏。</p>
<p>擺着幾把舊藤椅，有點陰濕的起坐間的牆上，掛着他新作的一塊二尺多長的浮刻。徒矮矮的窗上來的光，斜照在作品上，于是那面上淺淺的起伏，生了活潑的變化。那是春天的陽光，溫和的照着原野；農人們，一羣一羣的忙着耕種，把大地翻新，換上綠油油的豐裝。</p>
<p>春天，正如作品上告訴我們的，它給農民帶下來了新的希望。他們拏出整個的心思，全副的勞力，和所有的金銀，以至借貸，來耕，種，培養。白天，眼睛看看，夜裏，夢中想着：希望一個豐衣足食的年。</p>
<p>希望，希望，這忍耐到人所不能忍耐，克苦到人所不能再苦，最善良的中國農民，年年辛苦的結果，却是一天比一天更慘的命運：地不能種，家不能居，妻離子散，成千成萬的都在死亡線上。</p>
<p>作者以純熟的技巧，農民之子（開渠生于農家）的心情，表現農民勞動，所以格外來得親切，眞實，動人。那些鋤田的，那些插秧的，那三個女人與小孩，簡單，樸實，忍眞，使我想念到，我在十年離亂，飄泊于各省農村中，所見所共同生活過的農民，想起適才在街上，寒風大雪中，面黃肌瘦，衣不蔽體，伸手討乞的難民，他們不都正是這浮刻上所歌頌的人嗎？想到這裏，我心裏實在沉重得很。</p>
<p>開渠兄告訴我。他預備做四槐這樣的浮刻，表現他童年時代，在鄉下種山，割草，喂牛放美，與所見農人終年勞動的情形。這是中國美術，尤其是雕刻藝術一向所不取的題材，但這確是中國美術能有新發展的地方。我贊成他的意見，我覺得藝術家們不能再是風花雪月，或替大官富人消遣的時候了。爲了他們的藝術，爲了國家民族，他們應該面對現實，認眞的爲大多數的人，尤爲是替那些農人說話的日子了。</p>

<h3 id="c206">蚯蚓 <a href="#c206" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e206" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">206</a></h3>
<p>— 伯永</p>
<p>迎日春雨，泥濕的地面，時時可以看見蚯蚓。關於這個微蟲，孟子也曾用以比齊之賢士陳仲子，不過他是不贊成的，以爲太潔身自好，與救世無關，所以說：「充仲子之操，則蚓而後可者也，夫蚓，上食槁壞，下飲黃泉。」這話表面看來不錯，蚯蚓只是與土壤黃泉發生關係，而不與他物相爭。唯如認爲此是潔身自好，則大謬不然，蓋任何人皆知蚯蚓的「上食槁壞」是可以改良土地，增加肥料，於農家大有裨益的。在蚯蚓自己，固然不知，然此正有功成不居，日月行而不言的風度，吾人不能不歡喜贊嘆者也。</p>
<p>據說達爾文自幼研究此物，費了大半生時間，至一八八一年乃發表他的大著「由蚯蚓而起的植物性土壤，」證實地球上大部分土壤都曾經蚯蚓的改造。原文有云：「我們看見一大片滿生草皮的平地，那時應當記住，這平滑的地面，乃大半由於蚯蚓把不平的地方弄平了。想起來也很奇怪，原來這平地的表面全部曾從蚯蚓的身子裏通過，而且每隔不多幾年，也將再被通過。在人類未發明耕犂以前，蚯蚓早已會耕田了！世界上還有類似這種的小動物，在地球的歷史上，担任如此重要的職務者嗎？」</p>
<p>我們也實在想不到一條污穢的小蟲會有這麼大功績，科學家湯姆生統計每一方里面積之土地，每一年可有六萬二千二百餘噸的土搬到地面，而二十七年之中，二英尺深地面的泥土將全部翻至地上；達爾文計算英國耕地每一英畝中平均有蚯蚓五萬三千條，荒地可能有五十萬條，此每畝五萬三千條的蚯蚓在一年中可將十噸的泥土全部通過腸胃，移至地面，十五年中，此土可積至三寸，六十年可積至一尺厚。這就更加令人驚詫了。</p>
<p>因此我們也就想到一切默默無言的多數人，守了本分作工而不得稱讚與供養的人。世界上什麼東西不是這些人的一手一足之力弄成了的呢？埃及王的金字塔是，中國的萬里長城和運河也是，蘇俄的底尼伯大水閘何嘗不是？美國的百層大廈，長及數哩的金門大橋不也一樣嗎？我們見到在殘酷的戰爭中，有些人在發牢騷，說什麼「憑君莫話封侯事，一將成功萬骨枯，」於是巴黎有了無名英雄墓，華盛頓也建築同樣的豐碑，但絕沒聽說有人給爲工農事業犧牲的人設下一次祭典；戰爭是非常的，獸性的，破壞，老實說，乃是人類至愚的一樁表現，如今却有人爲之頌禱，爲之表彰，何以爲全人類的幸福與樂利而苦幹一生的人，反而冷落如此，我不能不再來一次對人類理性的悲觀與疑惑。</p>
<p>孔子或者比孟子有偉大之處，單看「士志於道，而恥惡衣惡食者，未足與議也」這種話，就比孟子來得廣博切實，又如「飯蔬食，飲水，曲肱而枕之，樂亦在其中矣」更是積極得好。雖然也會爲行道去拜會子路所反對的　子，可是在陳蔡挨餓也不曾過分怨天尤人，而且對答狂沮桀溺與楚狂的話也正有安分犧牲的意思，便是一吾非斯人之徒與而誰與，」好像蚯蚓注定非吃糞壤不可，不一定甘美如珍羞，却把草根爛葉一起吞下肚去，恐怕「知其不可而爲之」，也就是這般，唯有知其不可而爲之，所以才到底能够「有所爲」。人類的進步不是在投機取巧，而究在一步一步，一點一滴的積累，即便是流血的革命，也不過一點一滴加了速度，使之更快而已。凡投機與僥倖乃都是水管中的淤積與礦質沈澱，非疏通不可，革命之爲用，正在乎此耳。孔子對於顏子的陋巷瓢飲，大爲贊嘆者，正以其吃的雖是敗葉腐土，而眞能克己復禮，爲人之規模，在平凡中顯示其偉大；不是以外表的偉大，如「山節藻棁」之類，自文其不堪也。</p>
<p>然而世人設教，却以「偉人爲年靑小孩之偶像，命之崇拜，命之步趨，這眞是想不通的事。夫偉人者，猶之獸中有虎豹，鳥中有隼　，或者比較好些，也不過猩猩與鸚鵡耳。假定獸中全成虎豹，而沒有守夜的犬，捉鼠的貓，鳥中全成鷹隼，而無呢喃的燕子，捉捕害蟲，成列的飛鴻，傳遞書翰，試問將成何等世界？凡亂世皆偉人特多者，曹操自命爲偉，呂布袁紹也不甘落後，劉備孫權更凶，於是一戰於濮陽，再戰於下邳，三戰於赤壁，八十三萬人馬，成了猿鶴沙蟲，這是何人所賜？世上只要有人要作英雄，則「治」與「安」絕不可得而至，必須人人都作上食槁壞，下飲黃泉的平凡工作者，庶幾可以多謀一點幸福。不但此也，在我的印象裏，覺得作一英雄，放一響大砲，正非若何難事，只要選擇平常人不肯作，不願作，也不希望別人作的事，大大幹上一下，豈不就是英雄了也？古人說：「世無英雄使豎子成名」，這話正該反過來看，「日出而作，日入而息，　井而飲，耕田而食」的平凡老實工作與人民，看似容易，其實是何等之難！上海擁塞了五百萬人，農村却什麼都沒有，豈不是大家都想到都市來作英雄而視耕田　井爲長途嗎？我敢斷言，中國人乃至世界的人，如果不心中有一個醒悟，以平凡代替特殊，以普遍代替偉大，以默默代替囂囂，像幾萬條蚯蚓那麼，在一年之中翻出幾萬噸的糞土，給植物一種生長的力量，使大衆均能沾潤好處，這世界是永遠不會有太平和眞正進步的。</p>
<p>請向蚯蚓學習</p>
<h3 id="c207">黑 <a href="#c207" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e207" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">207</a></h3>
<p>— 念傳</p>
<p>爲什麼許多人憎惡黑色？是因爲牠表示無恥的靈魂嗎？是因爲牠象徵可怕的遭遇嗎？可是他們忘了黑的特點。在一個大染缸裏，多少的顏色改變了，可是黑，牠始終保存着這雖然是難看的顏色。讓我們再想想：烏鴉也許因爲黑色而被認作不吉利的鳥，可是，牠的孝心也足够表示牠的偉大。所以，當我們討厭一件事或者一樣東西時，別祗是爲了牠的表面，應該審視牠內在的特色。黑便是一個例子。</p>
<h3 id="c208">南湖之晨 <a href="#c208" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e208" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">208</a></h3>
<p>— 起鳳</p>
<p>晨霧還濃，露水正濕的當兒，我們懷着青春的喜悅，已悄悄地跨下了船艙。船一側，微驚之中，不覺相視一笑。只覺得船身已在款乃聲中，劃破了平靜如鏡的湖面，悠悠地前進了。</p>
<p>蘆蓆的頂已除去了。晨風帶着一種淸幽沁鼻的香氣從湖面輕輕地拂來。遠處，但見綠油油的一片，濛在迷迷的白霧中，分不清是田是屋。一個弓形的黑影浮在水面，搖近了原來是一座橋，低而狹。一個壯健的農夫站在橋頭，嘴裏銜着烟桿驚異地對我們望着，似乎在說：「好早的遊人啊！」</p>
<p>櫓聲有規律地響着，雖是單調，但在這恬靜幽美的淸晨倒是一種點綴。搖船的船孃，眼還惺忪，也許是昨宵未曾好睡，可是嘴角却帶着笑容。黑黝的臉色，結實的手臂，一件淸潔的藍布衫罩住了她那康健的身體，怪不得古來南湖船孃名聞江南，她們那種自然之美，確是別具風韻！她似乎察覺了我們的注視，頭一偏，訕訕地用鄉音說：「烟雨樓到了呢！」</p>
<p>眼前但見水中霧裏，濛濛糊糊地紅牆綠樹混成一片。幾株矗立的長枝和翹起的屋角隱約地現在茫茫白霧之中。我們不作一聲，懷了不勝低徊的心情，讓自己浸潤在這溫柔的靜美裏。</p>
<p>我們輕輕地從烟雨樓畔滑過，心裏思忖着：今日無雨，霧且算烟吧！悠忽再回首一望，紅牆黑瓦，亭台樓閣，俱隱藏在綠蔭裏。此情此景，幾疑置身畫中。</p>
<p>船底一陣沙沙之聲，原來是割短了的蘆葦碰到了船底。那面岸邊水草密處，悠悠地游來了一群鴨子，擺動着肥胖的身子，伸長了項頸，宏亮的聲刺破了靜寂。</p>
<p>一個圈子回轉，晨霧已在不知不覺中薄了，散了。仰起了頭，但見晴空萬里，淡淡地飄上了幾絲浮雲。陽光普照大地，祗覺得金光閃爍，耀着眼睛。</p>
<p>輕盈地跳上了岸階，走了幾步，還頻頻回頭凝望。這靜靜的南湖啊！她是如此的幽靜和樸實，實在使我依戀不忍言去了。</p>

<p>— 兆龍</p>
<p>閱本月二十日自由談中「故都兩故事」一文，關於褚先生故事一則，筆者未曾聽過，不敢置詞，至於王劍仙故事，筆者曾見過其人，願爲讀者一述。八一三前，一向寓居北平，民國十四五年時，即聞有王劍仙者，西山競走之傳說，亦曾聽到，很想一會，苦無機緣。至民國二十一二年（記不淸了），經王劍仙之弟子領導，前去會他，他是住在北平西城一廟內最後一大院，地方是很靜寂的。當要敲門時，他徒弟說，不要用力，用力打門他會要惱的，用指輕彈，他就聽見的了。果然一彈，他就來開門迎客入內，人約五尺十寸以上高，藍布大褂，瘦長臉，目光有神，我一見知是有中國武術根底的人。屋內設有佛座，桌上陳列滿了幾百個大小各種海蝶殼，坐下了，他也不讓茶，拿出酒杯，斟白乾來敬客。接談之下，覺他亦無甚文學修養，並無高深智識。我想與他多盤桓些時候，所以談東談西，談了一個多鐘頭，後來我說請他吃飯，他說好，於是扣起門就一同出去了。我看他像五十多歲的人，可是健步如飛（飛字不過言其快而已，並非如小說上劍仙的飛行）。到了館子，讓座時，我故意用手抆其腰，推之上坐，試試他的力量，覺得他身骨很硬，不易推動，但亦一般通武術者所俱有，不足爲奇。飯後即分手作別，深悔此來，眞是聞名不如見面，王某不過一深通武術者而已。至於彈指即來開門，我後細察他院中尚有一小門，通一甬道，直達廟門，或有人預先入門報告，然後稍候即來開門，亦未可知。總之劍仙之說不可信，王某亦絕對非劍仙也。（却酬）</p>

<p>— 毛毅</p>
<p>湯瑪斯·費尼甘是美國男子中結婚次數最多的人，他時常扮成新郎與陌生的女子在堪降斯州橫道特郡的法院內舉行婚禮。費尼甘常遭鼓盆之痛嗎？不。他沾花惹草嗎？也不對。費尼甘是郡內的一個律師，他是代表遠在海外的新郎與新娘舉行委託婚禮的。</p>
<p>在日本屈膝之前不久，費尼甘生意興隆，差不多每兩個屋期就結婚一次。他以爲戰爭一結束，這種結婚生涯就可以淸淡下來。誰料事實正與預料相反，他的委託婚禮更加忙碌，甚至不得不拉他的妻子爲助手。</p>
<p>費尼甘夫人所担任的職務是做新娘。有的美國退伍兵因爲新娘尚在海外，爲了想先舉行結婚儀式起見，便來討教費尼甘律師，費律師因爲自己是男性，不便代表新娘，就把自己的太太拉了出來。當地的人士遇見了費太太，常會打趣的問道：「你現在有多少丈夫了？</p>
<p>費尼甘辦理委託婚禮的業務開始於一九四三年。那一年，在華盛頓的檢察長辦公至內來了一個人，他有一個住在國內的姪女渴望與一個在海外服務的人員結婚，不知怎樣才合法。檢察長翻閱各州的法律之後，發現唯有堪薩斯州有委託婚姻法。於是他便寫了一封信給橫道特郡律師公會，當時的會長正是費尼甘，他把代表結婚的請求接受了下來，，從此就開始了這項新的業務。</p>
<p>如今，與費尼甘結過婚的新娘已達數十名之多，他在每次舉行婚禮之前，總要先把他們的秘書呌來，記熟了這一次的新娘的姓名與地址。有時候，委託婚禮的儀式舉行完畢以後，證婚的法官將他拉到一邊，悄悄的問道：「這個新娘是第幾號——四十五號還是四十六？」</p>
<p>委託婚禮並不是每一次都從容不迫的舉行的。有一個鄉下女子在婚前與他的情夫發生了關係，後來，男的奉調出國，女的却懷孕了。男女雙方都想在嬰兒出世之前趕緊辦完結婚儀式。日子非常迫促，女的正在密蘇里州的醫院中待產，她實在無法可想，祗有向費尼甘求援。他急忽忽的趕到醫院裘，把她陪到橫道特郡。在舉行儀式的時候，費尼甘和大腹便便的新娘都異常的緊張，唯恐胎兒在結婚進行曲起奏的時候，耐不住了，出來「觀禮」一番。幸而沒有發生這種笑話，新娘在平安的回到醫院之後第二天才生產，是一個女孩子——一個有了「合法的」父母的女孩子。</p>
<h3 id="c214">中州洛陽 <a href="#c214" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e214" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">214</a></h3>
<p>—</p>
<p>近覽十七日申報首版首欄洛陽地方之精製圖，可為中華國土及歷史最豐美的一頁之表徵。昔語所謂「天下之中」，所謂「縣花如錦」，所謂「自古帝王都」，形容詞不一而足。</p>
<p>河南省號稱「中州」，但開封雖是近代的省城，五代及北宋的京都，郤不能代表「中州」二字。洛陽纔是「天下之中」，舊爲「河南府」之首縣，河南府則是「河南省」的外府，故曰「河南不在河南省」。三國時曹魏挾天子以令諸侯，占據彰　河洛之地，自稱「中國」，以對蜀吳，又曰「中原」，故中華之「中」字，河南亨之最早。至於中州是否「天下之中」。古時所謂「天下」，即指本國之國土，更以東南是海，西北是山爲標準，大概衡量一下，找個東又近大海，西遠於沙漢，比較適中的地方，　以此中州爲近是。</p>
<p>「洛陽錦繡萬花叢」，「從來　谷鈉魂地」，繁華褥麗的史蹟，石祟綠珠的哀　故事，永久流傳，至今仍有「金谷園」遺蹟。李白詩云：「憶昔洛陽董曹邱，爲我天津橋南造酒樓」。洛陽的「天津橋」因詩仙的高吟面膾炙人口。於是河南的一個嘉名轉移到河北的天津，不曰「沽上」，即曰「津撟」。「沽上」確是天津的本地風光（七十二沽），「津橋」則借自「洛陽」。天津河流雖多，並無名橋古蹟。至於「萬國橋」，「金鋼橋」，建築雖極壯美，郤又是「洋式的津橋」了。</p>
<p>洛陽城外的北邙與伊闕龍門的勝概，見於各家游記。俞曲園由河南學政被劾落職回籍，以「已游伊闕與龍門」爲不虛此行，其爲名蹟可知。北邙山是古來業葬之地，歷代名都，無數名人都在那裏長眠。昔有安慰老人詩云：「老年莫嘆鬢毛斑，鬢到斑時亦大難。多少少年佳子弟。罡風吹上北邙山。」但自北宋以後，中州不復建都，都市的地位降低，這個「鬼都」（北邙）亦漸蕭條。北平的西山，則成了北方繼起的北邙。軍政大老段祺瑞是安徽人，死在上海，亦血北平的西山，張紹曾死在天津，亦葬西山。長腿將軍張宗昌是山東人，死在濟南，亦葬西山，名流梁啓超，羅　公，是廣東人，亦葬在西山。還有些福田公墓，萬安公墓，凡平津寓公，河北各界，一旦壽終，多向西山　骨。因之北平城外西郊地面，自然形成一座「現代的北邙」。</p>
<p>吳佩孚全盛時代，洛陽儼然政治中心。雖無國都之名，聲勢在北京之上。那時他戰皖戰奉，累勝之後，爲直魯豫巡閱使，他便選定洛陽爲駐節之地，因爲正當隴海鐵路之要衝，距平漢路交叉地亦不遠，東西南北，交通旣便，又是歷代帝王之都，尤其他所最崇拜的關夫子林墓所在，自以爲居中控馭，中國大局在掌握之中。民國十二年，他五十正壽，軍政界各省名士都去祝賀，康南海送的壽聯是：「牧野鷹揚，百世功名纔一半」，「洛陽虎視，八方風雨會中州」。南通張狀元送來的壽聯是：「萬里威名，似雷及遠」；「百年上壽，如日方中」。可見當時洛陽的氣勢。黎元洪曹錕在北京做總統，軍政界則遙奉洛陽的指揮，老吳的風頭達於極點。次年（甲子）對奉戰爭失敗，從此一蹶不振，洛陽的火熾情形，亦即消失，然其地位之重要，則所遺印象更深一層。</p>
<p>民國二十年九月，日寇發動「九一八」事變，次年一月，又在上海創作大規模之侵略，由淞滬威脅金陵。政府爲安全及抵抗計指洛陽爲行都，已有一部遷往，其時若非各國調停，成立和款，則全面抵抗，被迫開始，洛陽即近八年大戰中之重慶矣。其史值豈不重哉！</p>

<p>The Executive Yuan Passes Amendment to the Martial Law, Adjusts Salaries of Public Servants and Teachers, Adjusted Monthly Based on Index from April, Budget Overruns to be Covered by Tax Increases.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 23rd] The salary adjustment plan for public servants and teachers has been discussed and passed in the Executive Yuan meeting on the 23rd. It was decided to adjust salaries monthly based on the previous month's cost of living index, starting from April. The detailed measures will be submitted to the State Council for discussion after being drafted by the Directorate-General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics and the Accounting Department of the Executive Yuan. When the proposal was submitted for discussion at the Executive Yuan meeting on the 23rd, President Zhang specially attended and presided over the meeting. Mr. Zhang has been recuperating from illness since the end of last month. Now he has slightly recovered, and he attended the meeting to show the importance he attaches to the case, and made a one-hour explanation on the current fiscal revenue and expenditure. Then, Minister of Finance Yu Hongjun reported on the increased expenditures due to the salary adjustment, and the Ministry of Finance planned to increase revenue by adjusting taxes, such as customs duties and salt taxes, to make up for this expenditure. The various measures listed in the case are recorded as follows: A. Starting from April, the subsidy for civil and military employees of the central government and various provinces and cities will be adjusted monthly based on the cost of living index of the previous month. The total additional expenditure required for the first half of this year is 36 trillion for living allowances and 9 trillion for non-staple food, totaling 45 trillion. Except for the remaining 18 trillion under the budget's original living allowance and non-staple food reserve items, the shortfall is requested to be added to the special budget's adjustment of living allowance and non-staple food reserve items in one lump sum by the National Government. B. If the cost of living index difference is too large and the number of zones is too large, the Directorate-General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics and the Accounting Department of the Executive Yuan will formulate measures. C. Subsidies for non-staple food and public-funded students will be adjusted proportionally. D. The minimum monthly salary for public servants will be increased from an average of 13 yuan to an average of 15 yuan. E. Discretionary reduction of employees in various agencies, the purchase methods for Beijing, Shanghai, Pingjin will be discussed later.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 23rd] The salary adjustment plan for public servants and teachers was approved by the Executive Yuan, and the office expenses and personal special office expenses of various agencies were also adjusted at the same time. Office expenses increased by 1.5 times, and special office expenses increased by 1 time.</p>

<p>The Atmosphere of Vice-Presidential Election Permeates the Capital, Yu Youren Decides to Participate, Cheng Qian and Li Zongren Arrive in Beijing</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 23rd] The registration of National Assembly delegates was on its sixth day on the 23rd, and it was more enthusiastic than before. A total of 81 people registered throughout the day, bringing the total to 198. Yu Youren went to complete the procedures at around 8 a.m. on the 23rd. In addition, there were Xu Kan, Jiao Yitang, Shen Yiyun, Yuan Changying, Zhang Zeren, etc.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 23rd] Before the opening of the National Assembly, the atmosphere of the vice-presidential election began to permeate the capital on the 23rd. After Cheng Qian and Li Zongren arrived in Beijing one after another on the afternoon of the 23rd, they immediately made statements about participating in the vice-presidential election. Yu Youren, President of the Control Yuan, also made an informal statement on the morning of the 23rd, announcing his participation in the vice-presidential election. The reporter visited Mr. Yu and asked whether the National Assembly should amend the constitution. Mr. Yu said: The biggest task of this National Assembly should be to complete the election. The issue of amending the constitution should be studied at length. The constitution is still in its early stages of implementation and should not be amended hastily. If there are those who want to amend it, then the amendment will be discussed and revised item by item, which will take more than two months. Therefore, I believe that if there is a need to amend the constitution, a temporary National Assembly can be convened for this purpose within these six years. The reporter further inquired about his views on the constitution. Mr. Yu said: To study it in detail, there are still areas for consideration in the Legislative Yuan, the Executive Yuan, and the overseas Chinese elections. The reporter asked Mr. Yu if he would be interested in concurrently serving as the current President of the Control Yuan after running for Vice President. Mr. Yu said: The President of the Control Yuan should no longer hold concurrent public office? I am participating in the Vice President election, regardless of success or failure, but I hope that the personnel of the Control Yuan can be changed to a new situation and develop a new style.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 23rd] Yu Youren has decided to participate in the vice-presidential election. When Mr. Yu went to the National Assembly registration office on the 23rd, a reporter asked, "Have you decided to run for Vice President?" He replied, "I have decided." The reporter then asked him to state his motivation for running. Mr. Yu said in a firm tone: "My participation in the election is based on my long-standing aspiration to assist the Premier and the President for more than 40 years, to seek the realization of a constitution, and to create a Republic of China that is of the people, by the people, and for the people." The reporter asked, "Will you wait for the nomination of the Kuomintang Central Committee?" Mr. Yu replied, "Of course." The reporter further asked, "Have you resigned from being a member of the Control Yuan?" He replied, "I resigned a long time ago." Finally, the reporter asked, "Will you host a reception for the press?" He said, "I am preparing the invitations."</p>

<p>Li Zongren Visits Cheng Qian, Holds Half-Hour Talk</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 23rd] Cheng Qian, Director of the Wuhan Headquarters, arrived in Beijing from Wuhan on the 23rd and received a warm welcome. When Cheng Qian talked about his mission to Beijing, he admitted that he would run for Vice President and scheduled a press conference at 2 pm on the 24th to make a campaign speech. Cheng Qian arrived in Beijing at 4:30 pm on the 23rd by Jiangning ship. Sun Lianzhong, Zhang Zhen, Liu Wendao, He Zhonghan, Li Junlong, and Cheng's friends and villagers, more than 100 people, were already waiting on the shore. Sun and others boarded the ship first to greet him. Cheng was wearing a dark blue gown and a black mandarin jacket. He shook hands and exchanged greetings with the welcomers and was in a very excited and happy mood. As Cheng was being helped ashore by the welcomers, firecrackers were set off and applause resounded endlessly. Cheng made a brief speech in the ship at the request of reporters, stating that this trip was to report on his work and attend the National Assembly. The Founding Father advocated the revolution with the Three Principles of the People, overthrew the Qing Dynasty, and established the Republic of China. The President inherited the legacy of the Premier, led the victory of the War of Resistance, and completed nationalism. This constitutional government is now being implemented, which can complete democracy. He believes that people's livelihood will be completed in the future. Regarding the issue of Vice President, Cheng Qian said that he should urge his friends to participate in the election, because he is a member of the Kuomintang and the party has its party platform and policies, and the Premier has left a good ideology. His political views and actions should be in accordance with the decision of the party. Cheng Qian mentioned the situation in the Wuhan Headquarters jurisdiction, saying that it was generally very good, and the bandits on the Pinghan Line have been defeated. Fang Juehui, Xia Douyin, and others came to Beijing on the same ship with Cheng Qian to attend the National Assembly.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 23rd] Li Zongren, Director of the Beiping Headquarters, arrived in Beijing by special plane from Shanghai at 5:22 pm on the 23rd. He plans to visit President Chiang in the next few days for instructions. When Li's special plane landed at Ming Palace Airport, Sun Lianzhong, Lin Wei, Zhang Zhen, and dozens of people from Guangxi Province were all waiting at the scene. After Li got off the plane and exchanged greetings with the welcomers, he went to his residence to rest and met with reporters. Li first answered questions about running for Vice President. (Continued on page 2, column 1)</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 23rd] After arriving in Beijing, Li Zongren, Director of the Beiping Headquarters, visited Cheng Qian, Director of the Wuhan Headquarters, on Shanghai Road at 7:45 pm on the 23rd and held talks for about 30 minutes.

<p>A Tragic Page in the History of the Suppression of the Rebellion in Northern Jiangsu</p>
<p>[Our Zhenjiang Correspondent, 23rd] (1) In the battle of Yao'an on the 18th in Taixing, the garrison Zhao battalion encountered a large group of bandits in the area 7 li from Yao'an. Due to the disparity in strength, the entire battalion, from Zhao battalion commander down, bravely sacrificed in hand-to-hand combat. (2) In the battle for Huangqiao in Taixing on the 18th, Jiang Weizhou, director of the second district of Tai, district team deputies Liu Changkui and Xue Buhe, and township chiefs Wang Youcheng and Huang Yiyuan led the self-defense force and were lost in Yao'an, and fought fiercely with the bandits. By the morning of the 18th, because the fortifications were completely destroyed and the ammunition was exhausted, they were unwilling to be captured, destroyed their weapons, and collectively committed suicide with their families, which is one of the most tragic pages in the war history of the Jiangsu people's self-defense force since the suppression of the rebellion.</p>

<p>Drafting a Report on the Northern Economy, To Visit Zhang Qun and Attend the National Economic Conference</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 23rd] Shi Kuiling, a member of the National Economic Conference and director of the Tianjin Gold Control Bureau, flew from Beiping to Shanghai on the 22nd, and arrived in Beijing by train on the 23rd. In Tianjin, in addition to handling the work of the Gold Control Bureau, Shi also investigated the economic situation in the north on behalf of the National Economic Conference. Over the past month, Shi contacted more than 30 units. The results of his investigation have been drafted into a report, including a total of 24 items, including food, transportation, finance, diverting idle funds, and encouraging withdrawals, which will be provided to the government for reference. Shi is scheduled to visit President Zhang in the next few days to report on everything and will attend the National Economic Conference on the 25th. According to Shi, the economic situation in Beiping and Tianjin was still stable two months ago, but later, due to the rise in prices in Shanghai and the influx of idle funds from the Northeast, it also fluctuated. According to his investigation, if the government can take effective countermeasures and accommodate all parties' opinions, it can still improve the entire economic situation in the north. Regarding the idle funds in the Northeast, Shi believes that because the Northeast only has exchanges with Beiping and Tianjin, a large amount of idle funds are concentrated in Beiping and Tianjin. If the Northeast can exchange with other places, the idle funds will also disperse.</p>

<p>[Our Guangzhou Correspondent, 23rd] Du Zhenyuan, director of the Guangdong Railway Bureau, came to Guangzhou to visit Chairman Song to discuss the security issues along the railway line, and the result was satisfactory. Du said that Chairman Song has agreed to increase the number of national army troops and allocate a large number of armored vehicles to strengthen the defense. At present, two armored patrol vehicles have been dispatched, which has been quite effective. He also said that the US aid allocated to the railway this time is about 30 million US dollars, but to improve the railway and restore it to its pre-war state, at least 12,000 tons of steel beams, 1 million sleepers, 540 kilometers of steel rails, 1,000 freight cars, and 100 passenger cars are needed. In addition to the 50 locomotives ordered from Australia six months ago, which also need to be paid, a machinery factory must also be established. Therefore, more than 30 million is not enough to cover the preliminary calculations.</p>
<h3 id="e19">Merger of Aid to China Proposals: U.S. House of Representatives Begins Debate; $100 Million Grant Portion for Self-Defined Use <a href="#e19" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c19" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">19</a></h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 22nd] The U.S. House Rules Committee announced today that the House of Representatives will begin a comprehensive three-day debate on the combined foreign aid bill, including economic and military aid to China, on the 23rd. The House Foreign Affairs Committee submitted a 100-page report on the foreign aid bill to the meeting today, emphasizing that the situation in China, whether economically or militarily, is similar to that of hope. The report also pointed out that measures to withhold aid in order to achieve reform in China first have been tried, but this has only produced adverse effects. Currently, there is a certain force within China, supported and directed by foreign countries, which is about to engulf all of China. If we do not provide aid to China, then China may become a vassal state of the Soviet Union, or the civil war will continue to drag on.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 22nd] The aid to China bill is divided into two parts: the first authorizes an appropriation of $363 million to China, the use of which must be in accordance with the applicable provisions of the European Recovery Program. The execution of this economic aid to China will also be the responsibility of the administrator of the European Recovery Program; the second, the grant portion to China is up to $100 million, which China can use as it deems necessary, thereby allowing China to decide on its own to use this fund for military purposes. Since the Foreign Affairs Committee has made this $100 million a grant portion, allowing China to determine its own use, it technically avoids mixing military and economic aid in one case. After debates in the full sessions of the House and Senate, the aid to China bill will be submitted to a joint conference of the Foreign Affairs Committees of both houses to resolve the differences. It will then become the most final bill to be sent to the President for signature. The bill also stipulates that before Congress approves the appropriation, the Reconstruction Bank will advance $50 million to begin the implementation of the aid to China program. Vandenberg told reporters that the general objectives of the European Recovery Program, applicable to the aid to China program, will be included in the agreement established by both parties. This will stipulate certain matters such as self-help and oversight of usage. Vandenberg continued that the scope and limitations of the European Recovery Program Act also apply to China. The period for the European Recovery Program Act is four years, while that for aid to China is one year. After the expiration, any aid to China must be carried out by new legislation. The $100 million grant portion to China will assist the Chinese government in purchasing military supplies, and can also help in the transfer of surplus U.S. military supplies and materials to China, as long as the Chinese government intends to do so.

<p>[This newspaper, Beiping, 23rd] The official recapture of Liaoyang by the National Army has been fully confirmed by relevant sources here.</p>
<p>[This newspaper, Shenyang, 23rd] Wei Lihuang, speaking about the war situation, said: Although the bandits claim to have eleven columns, none of them are complete. As long as we seize the opportunity and wipe out two or three of their columns, we can defeat them all and fully recover the Northeast. The number of troops is not the only factor in military affairs; success or failure depends on human factors. Are the military operations effective? Is the coordination effective? He said: The strength of the National Army in the Northeast is not weak. Wei cited historical examples from China and abroad: Cao Cao's defeat at the Battle of Red Cliffs, Fu Jian's rout at the Fei River, and the Allied defeat at the Battle of Tannenberg in World War I, all of which achieved victory with fewer troops against many. Wei continued: Although the situation is difficult, the prospects remain optimistic. The National Army is buying time, and is fully prepared in terms of morale and material, so as to be invincible. The Communist bandits are accustomed to "big eats small," and if we also "big eats small," we will not be harmed to this day. He finally emphasized the importance of Northeast industry, saying: China's revival must begin in the Northeast.</p>

<h3 id="e23">Relief Special Levy After Principles Established <a href="#e23" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c23" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">23</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai District's fundraising for the relief special levy has had its principles determined at the third meeting. According to Mayor Wu's announcement, the main points are: (1) The target of the fundraising has been changed to great philanthropists, which is different from the original idea of issuing national crisis wealth, victory wealth, and bandit suppression wealth; (2) Everything will be handled in a coordinated manner, and there will be no rigid regulations on the amount of donations in various areas of the district; (3) The list of donors will also be drafted by the various areas themselves. Finance Minister Yu also stated: (1) There are no plans to impose rigid regulations on the amount, and it may be allocated by the various trade associations; (2) The names of the donors, if they do not wish to be published, should have their opinions respected and not be published; (3) Those who are stingy will not be forced, but it is hoped that they will be subject to public and moral condemnation. In this light, this relief special levy has truly become a special levy in name and in fact. It is not a tax, but a voluntary donation, not a compulsory allocation. Compared to the original idea of levying a one-time property tax, it is inevitably too far off-topic and feels like it exists in name only. However, in terms of the matter itself, the principles now being formulated can be said to be the most reasonable.</p>
<p>Because property tax was the original name proposed, it has undergone many modifications, such as temporary property tax, temporary special property tax, temporary property donation, property special donation, national construction donation, national construction special donation, etc., all of which have a very strong fiscal connotation, and the technology is not a little careless. Now that it is officially named the relief special levy, it has marked its special nature; in the second article of its measures, it is clearly stipulated that it is to be used for conducting relief work to aid refugees, and the responsible authorities have repeatedly stated that all the funds donated will be used entirely for relief and will not be diverted to military or political expenses: then, its nature and purpose are entirely charitable, compared with the usual water, drought, and winter relief donations, the scope is only particularly enlarged, and the central government and various local governments are only particularly solemn about it.</p>
<p>Since it is the same kind of donation, why should the scope be particularly enlarged this time? And why should all parties be particularly solemn about it? The reason is very clear. That is, after the eight-year war of resistance against Japan, which left scars everywhere, coupled with the rampant Communist bandits, who poisoned everywhere, burning, killing, and looting, the tragedy was extreme, so that all compatriots in the bandit areas, regardless of men, women, old, young, rich, poor, wise, or foolish, had no choice but to leave their homes and flee, to temporarily avoid their fierce flames and evil hands. Therefore, today there are particularly many refugees, and relief is particularly urgent, so the funds needed for relief are also particularly large. Furthermore, after the National Army recovered various areas, after the Communist bandits deliberately destroyed them, not only were nine out of ten houses empty and without food or clothing, but also production tools such as seeds and plowing cattle had been destroyed and plundered, leaving nothing. Under such circumstances of poverty and starvation, if a large amount of materials are not quickly transported and distributed for relief, what hope can there be for the survivors of the disaster? And how can all the production enterprises in such a vast area be restored? Is Shanghai not currently experiencing a raw material shortage? Although prices continue to rise, the actual sales are limited, and the purchasing power of the interior is extremely weak. If this phenomenon continues to deepen and cannot be actively restored, how can the raw materials and fuels needed by the industrial and commercial sectors be obtained from overseas? And how can the stockpiled manufactured goods rely solely on speculative hoarding as the only outlet? Therefore, the significance of carrying out relief and aid is not only passive, but also active: its nature is not only charitable, but also economic. If the focus is on providing disaster relief in areas such as Beijing and Shanghai, where refugees are gathering, in order to temporarily alleviate their hunger and cold, we believe that this is still only seeing one side of the problem.</p>
<p>Finance Minister Yu believes that the donation may be allocated by the various trade associations. Although the word "allocation" sounds very harsh, helping others is helping oneself. From the perspective of shared destiny and the lack of boundaries in the economy, we do hope that people in various regions will voluntarily and enthusiastically donate to revive the vitality of the disaster areas, which is to save the economic decline. As for those wealthy families, high officials, and dignitaries, although the authorities strongly advocate leniency and do not want to force them too much or hinder people from doing good, social atmosphere values leadership, and the disparity between the rich and the poor harbors crisis, and we even more eagerly hope that they will take the lead in donating and jointly support this good cause, not letting the ancient Bu Shi and Xian Gao monopolize the glory.</p>
<p>There is also one point that must be pointed out to the authorities, that is, providing relief and aid in accordance with reason has countless aspects, and cannot be accomplished in a moment. Disaster relief is like fighting a fire, and it cannot afford to delay or circle around. Therefore, although the relief funds are still in the process of being raised today, all preparations must be designed in advance to achieve rapid success. In addition to funding and personnel, all aspects such as regions, targets, materials, transportation, etc., should be planned in a coordinated manner and prepared systematically. It is not appropriate to waste any of the general expectations of the philanthropists, nor is it appropriate to be too trivial, resulting in the old formula of just adding a little embellishment. Because this fundraising has a large scope, the task is also increased accordingly. We remember that on the 5th of this month, when the Relief Special Levy Supervision Committee was formally established in the Executive Yuan, it made a decision to only allow success and not failure. We believe that this decision should be applied not only to the fundraising of the special levy, but also to the conduct of relief work.</p>

<h3 id="e24">Li Zongren's Speech in Nanjing <a href="#e24" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c24" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">24</a></h3>
<p>(Above, according to page one) Mr. Li Zongren said: Some candidates for vice president seem to be divided into civil and military positions or southern and northern people. I am a soldier, and I am very concerned about politics on weekdays, and I am also very close to civil officials, so there is no difference between civil and military. Although I am a southerner, I get along very well with northerners, so there is no regional distinction. In terms of international relations, I get along very well with friends from the United States and the Soviet Union. Li explained his reason for announcing his candidacy for vice president at the earliest time: to promote a democratic political atmosphere. Regarding the nomination of candidates, Li believes that in terms of democratic principles, free elections should be the top priority. When reporters asked Li who Li's formidable opponent was in the election, Li smiled and said: There is no so-called formidable opponent, and he is happy that the election is like playing basketball. There are senior old predecessors participating in the election, and I admire them very much. When reporters asked what he would do to assist the President in handling government affairs if he were elected Vice President, Li said that military affairs were the most important issue in the near future. This bandit suppression work will take three to five years in the short term and ten to eight years in the long term. I usually pay close attention to politics and will contribute my personal experience to the future new government. Li also emphasized his confidence in assisting the new government in completing bandit suppression. Regarding the economic issue, Li believes that in the face of a serious economic crisis, if someone contributes money and those with strength contribute their strength, there will be no problem. The United States is helping us because there is an urgent need, especially military assistance, because we are using military force to protect the people. We welcome the assistance of friendly nations, but self-help is blessed by God. We should still be self-reliant and rely on ourselves. Regarding the situation in the Northeast, Li said: The National Army is at a disadvantage in the Northeast. The Communist bandits are using a policy of violence to control a wide area. We only hold a few major strongholds in the Northeast and urgently need reinforcements to expand. As for North China, the National Army still occupies an advantage, with a large area. It is normal for Communist bandits to raid, but there should be no problem. Finally, Li said in a humorous tone: After he is elected President and takes office, the first measure will be gender equality and the promotion of women's rights.</p>

Speaker Pan said in his speech that the citizens of Shanghai are willing to do their utmost to support the suppression of bandits, but hope that the government will thoroughly reform and eliminate the phenomenon of extreme disparity between the rich and the poor in society, and hope that Director Li will convey the opinions of the citizens of Shanghai to the central government from an objective standpoint. Mayor Wu said: The current government is determined to renew itself with the people and has indeed moved in a changing direction. The delegates to the National Assembly all come from the people, which is a new phenomenon, and a dawn has appeared for the future of the entire country.

<p>[Reported by this newspaper] National Assembly Delegate Zhu Ping (Director of the Shanghai Land Administration Bureau) has drafted "Three Policies to Save the Nation" and a plan for the comprehensive implementation of agricultural land reform. He will exchange opinions with various delegates and parties when he goes to Nanjing to attend the National Assembly, and then make recommendations to the government. The content is roughly as follows: A. Economic Reform: The core issue of China's current economy is "how to balance the budget." Considering that extraordinary measures must be taken to balance the budget during this period of mobilization to suppress the rebellion, military expenditures should be separated from the general budget so that the general budget is not affected by military expenses. The following economic instructions must be implemented simultaneously: (1) Establish domestic currency; (2) All foreign trade should be state-run, and a barter system should be adopted as much as possible; (3) Implement agricultural land reform; (4) Gradually adopt a planned economic system to promote industrial development.</p>
<p>B. Military Reform: (1) Adopt an elite force strategy to reduce the number and improve the quality; (2) The main line of defense should be built on the economy; (3) Use elite troops to firmly defend points and lines, resist enemy attacks, and at the same time organize mobile elite units to be placed at several important transportation points, so as to attack the enemy's main force at any time and assist the attacked areas; (4) Obtain military supplies from friendly nations through loans; (5) Obtain military pay from a small number of wealthy households through secret donations, so as to avoid the continued unlimited expansion of currency due to raising military expenses; (6) Military rations should only be borrowed from a small number of large households, and should not generally increase the burden on ordinary people; (7) Conscription should focus on military training and organize the masses locally for training to enhance self-defense capabilities. C. Political Reform: (1) Improve the treatment of civil servants while protecting their positions; (2) Employ new talents; (3) Strictly implement the constitutional provision that "military personnel shall not hold civil positions"; (4) In the past, politics focused on the central government and provinces, while neglecting counties and townships, which was abandoning the essential for the superficial and reversing priorities. In the future, a "talent returning to the hometown" movement should be promoted to bring the most outstanding talents back to the most grassroots level.</p>

<p>Talking About the Situation of Transporting Compensation Materials</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, This City] Mr. Hu Shiyuan, Deputy Director of the Compensation and Returned Materials Transportation Office of the Ministry of Transportation and Deputy General Manager of the China Merchants Bureau, flew from Shanghai to Tokyo on the 16th for official business. He completed his work on the morning of the 23rd and returned to Shanghai from Tokyo on a Northwest Airlines flight. According to Mr. Hu's statement, after arriving in Tokyo, he visited the responsible persons of relevant agencies such as our delegation in Japan to strengthen communication and seek to accelerate the transportation of Japanese compensation materials. The first batch of compensation materials will be shipped by the end of April, but the second batch of 150,000 tons will have to wait for a lottery to decide. As for the business licenses for the Tokyo branch, Yokohama office, and Kobe office of the China Merchants Bureau, they have been issued by MacArthur's headquarters, but the official commencement of business still needs to wait. Currently, the focus of the China Merchants Bureau's work is to transport Japanese compensation materials to China and the barter materials transported to Japan by the Central Trust of China. Regarding compensation materials, existing Japanese ships are not included. Therefore, there are still no ships as compensation in the second batch of Japanese compensation materials. The total tonnage of existing Japanese ships has reached 1.62 million tons. In addition to 1.3 million tons of ships maintaining domestic transportation, the remaining 300,000 tons can be used for foreign expansion. All Japanese ships are uniformly managed and controlled by the government, and their crews are also requisitioned, so they are easy to command, and work efficiency is also good. Japan's shipbuilding plan is estimated at 300,000 tons per year. Its exports were mainly cement a month ago, and the target markets were Southeast Asia and Manila, followed by steel plates, coal, and hardware.</p>

<p>[United Press, Washington, 22nd] Congressional figures said that in addition to military aid to China in cash, they also intend to state that they require the United States to continue to handle any possible remaining military equipment and munitions for Chairman Chiang. It is reported that a proposal to airlift large quantities of surplus munitions from Hawaii and Okinawa to the Chinese government's troops in North China may have been under consideration, as the Chinese troops, although equipped with American equipment, lack munitions.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, New York, 22nd] The 19 newspapers of the Scripps-Howard system are now beginning to publish an article by Chennault describing the "Inside Story of American Policy Toward China." This was dictated by Chennault to Fan Zhixing, a Shanghai-based reporter for the system's newspapers, and written by Fan. The New York World-Telegram today published the first article on the front page under the headline "Flying Tiger General Chennault Speaks." In the article, Chen said that he intends to reveal in subsequent articles some details of what he calls the errors of American policy toward China.</p>

<p>Guangdong Begins to Repair Existing Embankments</p>
<p>[United Press, Guangzhou, 23rd] Smason, head of the Guangzhou branch of the American Government's China Relief Mission, announced on the 23rd that the first American-sponsored South China revival plan began on the 22nd. The plan is to repair 22 embankments. 7.6 billion yuan in national currency has been allocated for this plan. This fund is derived from the sale of rice, and the project is scheduled to be completed by May 1 (the spring flood season), but it still requires 500,000 US dollars to complete. The funds will be paid directly to the 22 embankment committees, which will eliminate middlemen.</p>
<p>Smason said that several other "national" programs have been approved by the mission and the American Relief Materials Handling Committee of the Executive Yuan. These plans include preventing and controlling diseases such as typhoid, tuberculosis, and cholera. In addition, many other plans have been proposed but not yet approved.</p>
<p>Smason also said that 26,000 tons of American relief rice will arrive in Guangzhou before the end of this month. The Chinese government and the Guangdong provincial government also contributed an equal amount of rice. Jilock, head of the Chinese Relief Mission, is scheduled to come to Guangzhou at the end of this week to inspect the embankment project.</p>

<h3 id="e55">Southern Kingdom Asks for Gorizia in Exchange for Trieste Port; Italy Resolutely Refuses; US and Soviet Union Will Strive for the Hong Kong Issue <a href="#e55" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c55" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">55</a></h3>
<p>[United Press, Yugoslav Capital, 23rd] Yugoslav Foreign Minister Semic said at a press conference yesterday that the Yugoslav government is prepared to resolve the Trieste issue through mutual consultation, even at the cost of returning the Trieste port to Italy, provided that Gorizia to its north is assigned to Yugoslavia. Previously, the Yugoslav government announced that it had lodged a strong protest with the United States, Britain, and France, opposing the manner in which the countries proposed to return the Trieste port to Italy, but the note did not state acceptance or rejection. Semic said that the Yugoslav government is prepared to negotiate with the current Italian government led by Gasperi.</p>
<p>[United Press, Rome, 23rd] A Foreign Ministry spokesman said today that Italy resolutely refuses Yugoslavia's proposal to exchange Gorizia for Trieste. "Italy cannot cut off a piece of its own flesh to exchange for another piece of its own flesh."</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 23rd] US diplomatic authorities today rejected Yugoslavia's proposal to cede Gorizia to Yugoslavia as a condition for returning Trieste to Italy. According to State Department officials, Trieste originally did not belong to Yugoslavia, and its return to Italy is not something Yugoslavia can use to bargain for. The opinions of the Yugoslav government are not of much concern to the United States, Britain, and France. When the three Western powers proposed returning the Trieste port to Italy last Saturday, they notified the Soviet Union and Italy, the two countries concerned, by formal note, and sent a copy of the note to Yugoslavia for reference only, out of consideration for diplomatic etiquette. Yugoslavia has nothing to do with the agreement to designate the Trieste port as an international free zone. The Yugoslav Foreign Minister's proposal to exchange the Trieste port for Gorizia is the same as that rejected by the Italian cabinet in 1946. The three Western powers will reject both Yugoslavia's formal protest and the exchange proposal.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Moscow, 22nd] Observers here commented on the Anglo-American-French proposal to return the Trieste port to Italy, saying that the Soviet Union will not easily give up the right to speak in the administrative bodies of Trieste that it obtained through the United Nations. The Soviet Union has repeatedly urged the speedy appointment of a governor of the Trieste port. The Soviet Union's policy is aimed at supporting the United Nations, not at reducing the responsibilities of the United Nations.</p>

<p>[United Press, Trieste, 22nd] According to an announcement by the Allied Military Government: Yugoslav patrol troops intruded into the British and American zone of the Free Territory of Trieste on the 22nd and engaged in a machine gun battle with police, seriously injuring one officer. A Yugoslav patrol troop crossed the southern border and intruded into Traga in the British and American zone and, "without warning," fired a machine gun at a civilian police officer. The officer returned fire, and the Southern troops fled back. It is unknown whether they were hit. Earlier, the military government authorities had declared that police on the border between this area, the Free Territory of Trieste, and Yugoslavia had engaged in a gunfight with Yugoslav people, so it is currently unclear whether the Southern patrol troop was involved or if this was a separate incident. After Britain, the United States, and France suggested that Trieste be returned to Italy, the Yugoslav-Trieste border became extremely tense. The most important people's organization in Trieste, the Trieste Regional Committee, has telegraphed Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov and the United Nations Security Council, requesting approval of the proposal to return Trieste and organizing a delegation to visit British Commander Airey, who is in charge of the British and American occupied zones, asking him to convey the gratitude of the people of Trieste to the Allied governments. There is no unrest in the city of Trieste, but the Italian people are celebrating wildly everywhere, with some taking spontaneous holidays and not working.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 22nd] Rome Radio reports that the British and American troops in the Free Territory of Trieste, adjacent to the Free Territory of Istria, have been ordered to remain in their camps since midnight on the 21st and are not allowed to leave. At the same time, the defense forces along the southern border of the Free Territory have been strengthened.</p>

<p>[Associated Press, Rome, 23rd] A Foreign Ministry spokesman declared today that although the United States, Britain, and France have proposed amending the peace treaty to return Trieste to Italy, Italy does not hope to recover its former territories. This is because Britain strongly opposes this matter, making it difficult to reach an agreement with the United States and France. France is very willing to return Eritrea, Somaliland, and Libya to Italy, and the United States and the Soviet Union have no objections, but Britain's attitude is ambiguous.</p>

<p>[Reuters, Washington, 20th] The U.S. House of Representatives, after half an hour of discussion, passed by voice vote an immediate appropriation of $55 million for France, Italy, and Austria to purchase essential imports before the implementation of the Marshall Plan.

<p>[Associated Press, Rome, 23rd] Prime Minister Gasperi and Foreign Minister Sforza returned to Rome together today. Crowds at the station and along the way shouted slogans such as "Long live Trieste," "Long live Gasperi and Sforza." Gasperi said to the crowd, "We still do not know what the future holds. We must still wait. We must approach this with great patience. Nothing can be achieved without effort. Effort should transcend party lines."</p>

<p>[Associated Press, Washington, 23rd] Naval authorities stated today that Republican Congressman Miller's claim that most of the U.S. fleet had been transferred to the Mediterranean, and that several ships were carrying atomic bombs, must be based on misinformation. Miller claimed yesterday that if Yugoslavia attacked Trieste or northern Italy, or if the Soviet Union tried to expel us from Germany, we would see atomic bombs fall within 48 hours. Most U.S. aircraft carriers are currently stationed in the Mediterranean, and several battleships are near Trieste, controlling the situation there. Naval authorities corrected this, stating that the United States only has fourteen warships stationed in the Mediterranean, namely, the aircraft carrier "Philippine Sea," three cruisers, and ten destroyers. None of them are equipped with atomic bombs.</p>

<p>[Reuters, Berlin, 23rd] The British, American, and French military governments have demanded that the Soviet government immediately clarify the meaning of the Soviet Union's announcement that the Berlin Allied Control Council will not hold regular extended meetings. Allied military government officials specifically pointed out that the three powers issued a note to the Soviet Union "demanding" rather than "requesting." Today, the Soviet secretarial staff of the Allied Control Council went to work as usual, but did not hold a meeting. An Allied spokesperson said that the situation is currently very uncertain, and the Soviet Union should soon make a definitive statement as to whether the Berlin Four-Power Control Agency will continue or will end. It is also learned that American officials of the Berlin Four-Power Military Government are reviewing the possibility of making the American zone of Berlin a close-knit unit after the Soviet Union withdraws from the military government. According to sources, the note from the British, American, and French military governments to the Soviet military government includes the following demands: (1) The Soviet Union should immediately clarify the meaning of its actions; (2) Whether the Soviet Union is willing for the Allied Control Council to continue its mission; (3) If the Soviet Union intends to end the Allied Control Council, what kind of agency does it intend to replace it with; (4) The Soviet Union should know that the establishment of the Four-Power Control Council was determined by the Potsdam Agreement, and the Western powers participated based on their rights, so any alternative agency should also have the participation of the Western powers. This note can be jointly issued by the United States, Britain, and France. According to Berlin newspapers, six former German staff officers and two former senior members of the German Youth League have drafted a complete plan for the establishment of an independent government in East Germany in the past three months.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Berlin, 23rd] Since Marshal Sokolovsky withdrew from the Four-Power Allied Control Council meeting seat, the activities of the Berlin Special Control Mechanism have entered their third day. A senior Soviet official stated that it has not yet been decided whether the Soviet Union will definitely withdraw its Four-Power representatives from the Allied Control Council. Currently, due to "heavy workload," Soviet officials are unable to attend the Allied Control Council. Although this indicates that the Soviet Union has not definitely withdrawn from the control mechanism, there is no indication that the Soviet authorities are prepared to restore Four-Power cooperation. At the same time, due to the unclear situation, various rumors have arisen. One rumor is that Marshal Sokolovsky has flown back to Moscow for instructions, and another rumor is that the families of Allied personnel have been evacuated from Berlin. The former has not yet been confirmed, and the latter has been denied by the relevant parties. Currently, propaganda attacks from both sides have been fully launched in Berlin's eighteen newspapers and radio stations.</p>
<h3 id="e70">Papanek States in Security Council that Czechoslovakia Was Oppressed by the Soviet Union; Requests that Beneš Be Invited to Testify <a href="#e70" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c70" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">70</a></h3>
<p>[Reuters, Lake Success, 22nd] The Security Council today voted nine to two to allow former Czechoslovakian representative to the United Nations, Papanek, to participate in the Security Council's discussion on the situation in Czechoslovakia. The Soviet Union and Ukraine voted against. Papanek then took his seat amidst applause. Papanek reported to the Security Council that the Soviet Union and the Communist Party had begun to undermine Czech democracy before the end of the war, and that every action of the Communist Party was aimed at destroying Czech democratic life and making Czechoslovakia completely diplomatically submissive to the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>Papanek cited the following examples: (1) After liberation, the Czech government delegation was prevented by Soviet troops from contacting the Carpathian Russians; (2) When Beneš led advisors to Moscow in 1945, the Communist Party forced the government to give important positions to Communists; (3) In the economic field, the Soviet Union has taken over Czech oil mines; (4) Last July, the Soviet Union forced Czechoslovakia to withdraw from the Marshall Plan. Beneš personally told him that when he went to Moscow in 1945, he was at one point prevented from communicating with the outside world by Soviet troops. At that time, Foreign Minister Masaryk was in San Francisco, and Molotov repeatedly threatened him, telling him that if he did not adopt the same policies as the Soviet Union, the Soviet Union would sever relations with Czechoslovakia. Papanek further said that President Beneš has lost his freedom, and if he had freedom, he would have resigned. Papanek asked the Security Council to invite Beneš to the United Nations to prove that he was forced to accept Gottwald's dictatorship. The success of the Czech communist coup will encourage communist forces around the world, especially in Europe, and will result in riots and conflicts, so it cannot be regarded as merely an internal affair. Papanek also said that the armed militias in the streets of Prague during the coup included Soviet spies, and witnesses to these facts are now in London and Germany and have telegraphed that they are willing to testify before the Security Council.</p>
<h3 id="e71">Communist Tide Must Be Checked, Cadogan Warns <a href="#e71" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c71" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">71</a></h3>
<p>[United Press, Lake Success, 22nd] Britain today warned the United Nations that the spread of communism must be stopped, even if it means resorting to war. British representative Cadogan told the Security Council, "There must be a limit to this communist tide, and it must be stopped when this limit is exceeded." Cadogan made an unprecedentedly harsh indictment of the Soviet Union in the Security Council, saying, "The British know that the Soviet Union is preparing to help the Communist Party seize power in Italy." He pointed out that the recent coup in Czechoslovakia, compared with previous coups in the Balkan countries, shows that this is a Soviet "old trick." Cadogan quoted a report from the new Czech Minister of Foreign Trade as saying, "We must thank our Slavic allies, especially the Soviet Union, for making it possible for us to defeat the reactionaries." This is enough to prove Soviet interference. Cadogan also agreed with Papanek that the reason for the Czech Communist Party's crackdown was the deep fear of being defeated in the May elections. Cadogan then mentioned the upcoming Italian elections, saying that the British know that a plan to assist the Italian Communist Party in carrying out a similar change to Czechoslovakia is already prepared. In the past few weeks, Yugoslavia has sent arms to the Italian Communist Party, and he said that these arms have been seized by the Italian government several times. In front of a nervous audience, Papanek directly pointed out that the Soviet Union's strategy is the same as that of Nazi Germany. He pointed out that the strategists in the Kremlin were already planning the coup in Czechoslovakia before the end of World War II. He said that Czech President Beneš is actually a prisoner of the communist government, and he strongly stated that former Foreign Minister Masaryk was definitely not a suicide.</p>

<p>Striving to Reduce Tensions Between the Two Major Blocs</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 23rd] United Nations Korean Committee Chairman and Indian Ambassador Menon, who returned to Nanjing from Korea, will soon return to India to take office as Deputy Foreign Minister. Menon received a reporter from the Central News Agency alone on the 23rd and discussed Indian foreign policy at length. It is said that India's foreign policy, as marked by Prime Minister Nehru, follows two principles: (1) India avoids belonging to any power bloc, and further strives to reduce the tensions between the two major blocs in the world. (2) For Asian countries that intend to become independent, India is willing to provide any possible assistance. The economic situation of some Asian countries is progressing from a colonial status to a national economic status, and India will do its best to promote this progress.</p>
<h3 id="e77">News Freedom Conference Opens Yesterday; Philippine Representative Elected Chairman; United Nations Under-Secretary-General Koh Heng Attends and Delivers Speech <a href="#e77" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c77" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">77</a></h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Geneva, March 23, from this newspaper] The News Freedom Conference opened here at 11:00 AM. The Chinese delegation's seats were arranged in the ninth row of the second section. The assembly hall was built in 1937 and used as the General Assembly Hall of the League of Nations from 1937 to 1939. The United States delegation included five representatives and five alternate representatives. The Soviet delegation was led by Ambassador to France, Mr. Bogomolov. The Chinese delegation has moved from the Seize Hotel to the Eton Hotel. They were quite tired after six days of continuous flying, and Mr. Ma Xingye's ears were severely affected by the noise of the aircraft engines. The Chinese government's response regarding the United Nations' news freedom issue will be presented tomorrow and is generally expected to be one of the most comprehensive responses submitted by various countries. In today's meeting, the Chinese delegation distinguished itself in two aspects: (1) Mr. Bogomolov suggested that non-member states of the United Nations should have the right to vote in the election of the General Assembly Chairman, but the head of the Chinese delegation, Mr. Zhang Pengchun, opposed this, and the result was a victory with 27 votes against 6; (2) The Chinese delegation recommended General Romulo, the chief representative of the Philippines, as Chairman of the General Assembly, and Mr. Romulo was elected as a result.

<p>[United Press Geneva, March 23] The United Nations News Freedom Conference opened here today, with representatives from more than fifty countries, totaling 300 people, participating. United Nations Under-Secretary-General Koh Heng delivered the opening speech, criticizing world newspapers, saying, "It is most unfortunate that people in various countries around the world have not been able to obtain the truth about the world situation. The time has come to find ways to make news reporting both free and responsible. New scientific inventions have greatly advanced transportation, and the dissemination of current events and opinions through printing, speech, and images has greatly expanded the entire concept of what was previously called news freedom. Judging from the current general news reports, the world is on the brink of a third world war, which is regrettable." The conference is expected to last five weeks. All 57 member states of the United Nations and 13 non-member states were invited to participate, and almost all countries within the Soviet sphere of influence are represented.</p>
<h3 id="e78">British House of Commons Discusses Defense Against Atomic Bombs <a href="#e78" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c78" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">78</a></h3>
<p>[Reuters London, March 22] The House of Commons held a civil defense debate today. Mr. Anderson, former Chairman of the UK Atomic Energy Advisory Committee and wartime Chancellor of the Exchequer in Churchill's coalition cabinet, advocated for the rapid formulation of policies to enable people to evade the effects of atomic bombs. He pointed out that the effects of an atomic bomb explosion can be studied in four categories: (1) the blast force of the explosion; (2) the high heat generated by the explosion; (3) the radiation effects after the explosion; and (4) the sustained effects after the explosion. He said that the blast force of an atomic bomb is the same as that of an ordinary bomb, except in the area close to the center of the explosion, so ground-based anti-bomb facilities can still be adopted. As for dealing with the burning of high heat after the explosion, even very thin materials, even parchment paper, can prevent it. To avoid radiation exposure, thick-walled facilities should be used. Air-raid shelters from the last war only need to have their walls thickened to avoid radiation effects. It is best to have thick concrete walls; otherwise, stacking several feet of sandbags outside can also isolate radiation effects. As for the persistence and transmission of effects after the explosion, it is difficult to determine how long people hiding in air-raid shelters must wait before they can go outside. The simplest preventive measure is to distribute simple instruments to test the effects of the explosion, to be used by the managers of the air-raid shelters after the bombing to determine whether the people inside the shelters can go outside. Although the handling of materials contaminated by radiation effects after the bombing is more difficult, most of the radiation will disappear in a very short time, so people in air-raid shelters only need to wear appropriate boots, shoes, and gloves to go outside for a short period, and can even pass through areas still affected by radiation.</p>

<h3 id="e80">Conscription Lottery Completed; List of Selected Names to Be Announced Starting Today; Numbers 183 to 619 Drawn for Ages 21 and 23 <a href="#e80" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c80" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">80</a></h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] This city's pioneering conscription lottery for this year was held yesterday under close scrutiny from all parties. The lottery numbers drawn included 183 and others for those born in the 16th year of the Republic (i.e., 21 years old), totaling 211 lottery numbers; 183 and others for those born in the 15th year, totaling 196 lottery numbers; and 45 and others for those born in the 14th year, totaling 212 lottery numbers. The names of eligible young men selected in each district will be publicly announced sequentially, starting today, after matching them with the numbers.</p>
<p>The Military Service Association held a grand ceremony when the lottery was conducted at 2:00 PM yesterday on the third floor of the City Council, as the city's conscription lottery was a pioneering effort. Attending the lottery meeting of the Military Service Association were all committee members, district chiefs from each district, representatives of district residents, representatives of the Kuomintang, Youth Party, and Democratic Socialist Party, representatives from the garrison district, City Council, Chamber of Commerce, General Labor Union, local associations, the Supervisory Commissioner's Office, and the District Prosecutor's Office, including Fang Zhi, Xu Jiyun, Zhao Junhao, Shui Xiangyun, Zhou Xuexiang, Gu Ruilin, Cai Qinglan, Chen Tianqiao, and over a hundred other people. Commander Chuan Zhengmo from the Shanghai Garrison District attended the meeting on behalf of the Bureau of Military Service of the Ministry of National Defense to provide guidance. The ceremony was presided over by Mayor Wu Guobai, who also serves as the Conscription Supervisor, and City Councilor Speaker Pan Gongzhan, who also serves as the Director of the Military Service Association. Mayor Wu said in his speech: Military service is an obligation that citizens should fulfill, as is the case in the United States and the Soviet Union. Recruiting volunteers is not the best approach, so the lottery system is also being implemented this year. The selected young men have been reported to the central government for permission to stay in Shanghai to protect the local area, achieving two objectives at once. Representatives from various legal entities are invited to participate in the lottery process together, and the names of the selected young men will be announced to prevent abuses. If any sectors discover any instances of bribery, they are encouraged to report them as much as possible. Commander Chuan said in his speech that only 6,000 people are being selected from the city's more than 170,000 eligible young men this year, which is a very small number, and he specifically stated that selected young men who fail the physical examination will not be allowed to enlist.</p>
<h3 id="e81">Reasons for Adopting an Indirect Lottery Method <a href="#e81" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c81" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">81</a></h3>
<p>Director Pan said in his speech that the reason for the indirect lottery is that the city has more than 170,000 eligible men, and "the situation does not allow each person to come to the venue to draw a lottery in person." The Military Service Association representatives will draw the lottery according to law, and he hopes that all parties will promote this more to establish a good foundation for the city's military administration. Director Fang provided two points of view: (1) Recently, slogans have appeared that damage military administration and oppose the lottery, which are clearly the work of underground communist agents, and it should be suggested that the government severely punish them. (2) The lives of the selected young men should be substantially improved in the future. Finally, Director of Civil Affairs and Deputy Director of the Military Service Association, Zhang Xiaosong, explained the lottery method (already published in this newspaper on the 3rd of this month) and reported that the total number of eligible young men in the 16th, 15th, and 14th years of the Republic is 220,299. The number of applicants for exemption or deferment was 118,631. After review and approval, 51,315 were granted deferment of call-up, 7,049 were granted deferment of conscription, 814 were granted exemption from military service, 11 were granted prohibition from military service, 13,831 provided supplementary documents, and 45,611 were disapproved. There are now 174,688 participants in the lottery. The 16th, 15th, and 14th years will participate in the lottery first. If the quota can be filled, the 13th and 12th years will stop drawing. Mr. Zhang continued to report on compiling the lottery number roster, using the bao as the unit. There are a total of 1,088 bao in the city. The third bao of Luwan District has the most eligible young men, with 211 from the 16th year, 196 from the 15th year, and 212 from the 14th year. The 39th bao of Yangjing District has the fewest, with only one from the 16th year and three from the 15th year. The 44th bao in the same district only has one person from the 14th year.</p>
<h3 id="e82">Roster Sealed; Lottery Begins <a href="#e82" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c82" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">82</a></h3>
<p>After Mr. Zhang finished his report, representatives checked the lottery number rosters, and Mayor Wu, Director Pan, and representatives from each district sealed and signed each one, packing them into three wooden cabinets. Afterwards, according to law, Director Pan and representative Zhou Xuexiang began to draw the lottery. The atmosphere in the meeting immediately became tense. Under the gaze of the crowd, Director Pan first drew lottery number 183 for the 16th year, and then drew 211 lottery numbers in order, such as 125 and 100. For the 15th year, 196 lottery numbers were drawn, such as 183, 61, and 137. For the 14th year, 212 lottery numbers were drawn, such as 45, 201, and 88. All were carefully checked and recorded in the roster. The lottery work was completed successfully, and it was already early evening.</p>
<p>The names of the selected men from each district, which were drawn yesterday, are scheduled to be matched with the numbers at the City Council starting at 9:00 AM today. Two councilors from each district, one representative from the district residents, and one representative each from the Kuomintang, Democratic Socialist Party, and Youth Party are invited to supervise the process each day. The district assignments for matching numbers for the three days are as follows: 24th: Huangpu District, Wusong District, Yulin District, Tilanqiao District, North Sichuan Road District, Dachang District, Penglai District, Yimiao District, Laoza District. 25th: Luyu District, Changshu District, Xinshi District, Jiangwan District, Xinjing District, Longhua District, Sisheng District, Yangjing District, Gaoqiao District, Zhenru District. 26th: Changning District, Jing'an District, Xincheng District, Jiangbei District, Songshan District, Putuo District, Zhabei District, North Railway Station District, Hongkou District, Xuhui District.</p>
<p>District Chiefs' Opinions: List Should Not Be Published</p>
<p>The Military Service Association held an interim standing committee meeting after the lottery yesterday. To prevent various abuses, a detailed discussion was held on the issue of publishing the list of selected young men. It was decided that a partial list would be published after matching the numbers today, and a decision would be made later on whether to publish the entire list depending on the situation. The district chiefs of each district also held a meeting last night and generally believed that, given the current situation, the list of selected young men should not be published to avoid desertion. Each district separately convened meetings of bao chiefs overnight to provide input for the authorities to adopt.</p>

<p>[Report from this newspaper] Fang Tinghua, the manager of the Postal Remittance Bureau, and Fang Jianbiao, the chief auditor of the Postal Remittance General Bureau, recently flew to Hong Kong to testify in the Xu Jizhuang embezzlement case. Furthermore, Peng Bingcheng, chairman of the Ocean Shipping Company, owed the Postal Remittance Bureau over 30 billion yuan in collateral. Mr. Peng plans to sell all of the Ocean Shipping Company's ocean liners, worth approximately 40 billion yuan, which would be more than enough to repay the debt. Because the District Court suspected that Mr. Peng colluded with Xu Jizhuang to commit fraud, to preserve evidence, it seized the ocean liner in accordance with Article 133 of the Criminal Procedure Law.</p>

<p>[Report from this newspaper] The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce Commodity Exhibition Hall held a joint reception for reporters from various newspapers in the city at 3:00 PM yesterday afternoon on the third floor of the Chamber of Commerce, together with the Vietnam Southern Branch General Chamber of Commerce. Representative Cai Maozhi reported on the purpose of coming to Shanghai, stating: In the past, Saigon, Vietnam, held a "Goods Exhibition" once a year, but most of the exhibits were local Vietnamese products. The exhibition period will come again on April 10 this year, but the scope has been expanded to include exhibitions of Chinese, American, British, Soviet, French, and Vietnamese goods. The Southern Branch General Chamber of Commerce has now opened a Chinese Pavilion in the exhibition hall and has received the support of our consulate in Saigon. A special representative has been sent to Shanghai to solicit samples from national goods manufacturers in the city to take back to Vietnam to participate in the exhibition, to add glory to the country and to fulfill the aspirations of the local overseas Chinese. The principle for soliciting goods is one item per manufacturer. If it is inconvenient to carry, photographs and samples can be substituted. If a price is required, the association will pay according to cost; otherwise, it will be responsible for sending it back after the exhibition. All participating manufacturers will be awarded certificates by the association as a souvenir. Mr. Cai also stated that he had negotiated with Air France in Saigon and secured a 500-kilogram tonnage, scheduled to fly from Shanghai to Vietnam on April 2.

<p>[Report from this newspaper] The Shanghai Standard Land Price Evaluation Committee is scheduled to hold its fourth meeting at the Land Administration Bureau at 10:00 AM today to evaluate the standard land prices for the Huangpu, Hunan, Zhabei, Yinxiang, Fahua, and Caojing districts, for which land registration has been completed in the 37th year of the Republic.

The standard land prices for the city in the 36th year were evaluated at a meeting held on April 2 last year. The highest was the corner lot of Nanjing Road on the Bund in the first grade of Huangpu District, priced at 550 million yuan per mu. The lowest was agricultural land in Xinjinggang North Xujiazhai and other locations in the sixth grade of Caojing District, priced at 600,000 yuan per mu.

<h3 id="e93">Resolving to Thoroughly Eliminate the Practice of Obtaining Materials and Profiteering Therefrom by Establishing Dummy Businesses Under False Names <a href="#e93" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c93" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">93</a></h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] The situation in the city is complex, and there are many businesses, some of which inevitably include illegal merchants setting up businesses under false names to make profits. Recently, the Taiwan Sugar Corporation was reported for sugar allocation fraud, which pointed to a large number of "paper" sugar firms with no business facilities or employees, which took advantage of the large difference between the allocated sugar price and the market price to resell the allocated sugar on the black market. The case is currently being investigated by the relevant authorities.</p>
<p>The Ministry of Economic Affairs recently issued a nationwide order to provincial and municipal authorities in charge, requiring them to thoroughly eliminate businesses that are established under false names and harm the social economy. In accordance with laws and regulations, legal companies and businesses should undergo legal registration, have a fixed capital, business premises or production factories, and should also hire employees and maintain accounts. However, recently, there have been instances where businesses have not been legally registered, or even if they have been registered, they only have a brand name and assume that the business has been established. In reality, they have no business premises or facilities, products, or factories, nor do they have employees or accounts. Some may not even have customer transactions throughout the year, using only the brand name as a talisman for taking advantage of speculation, swindling, disregarding business ethics, and corrupting good customs. Furthermore, during this period of suppressing the rebellion, there are those who seek to obtain important materials controlled and supplied by the government and profit from them, creating panic in the market and obstructing public order. Such businesses that are not properly established, set up under false names, and harm the social economy should be strictly eliminated. Any firm found to have a fictitious name will be punished lightly and ordered to cease operations severely. If someone claims to be a company, they should be sent to the court for punishment. Or, if they operate on the surface but are virtually fictitious, or if they meet the conditions of Article 26 of the Company Law, their registration should be immediately revoked. Businesses and companies that have been banned may not be allowed to resume operations unless they have been legally re-registered and meet the various requirements on the right. Those who knowingly violate the law should be held accountable in accordance with the law to stabilize the market.</p>

<h3 id="e96">Lingering Echoes of the Tang Jiapeng Blood Case; Gu Zhuxuan Not Guilty; Prosecutor Appeals <a href="#e96" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c96" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">96</a></h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] In the assassination of Tang Jiapeng, manager of the Great World amusement center, 14 years ago, Gu Zhuxuan, the old manager of the Tianchan Opera House, was charged with instigating murder. On October 27 of the 24th year of the Republic, the Second Special District Court sentenced Gu to 15 years in prison. Gu appealed to the High Branch Court, which declared him not guilty on June 26 of the 25th year. The prosecutor appealed the decision, and the Supreme Court sent the case back for a retrial. The War of Resistance broke out, and the case was delayed until now.</p>
<p>The High Court repeatedly summoned Gu for questioning starting on September 8 of last year. However, important witnesses Zhao Guangfu, Wang Xinggao, Zhang Tinggui, Xue Zhenji, etc., had either died or their whereabouts were unknown. The High Court then relied on the evaluation report of the clerk of the former High Branch Court, which determined that Zhao Guangfu's blackmail letter was handwritten, and that there was indeed a suspicion of blackmailing Gu Zhuxuan, and declared him not guilty on December 31 of last year. This 14-year-old blood case could have come to an end. However, Luo Shouchang, the prosecutor of the High Prosecutor's Office, still had questions about the case and expressed disagreement with the original judgment. He recently filed an appeal with the Supreme Court. The reason for the appeal was that Gu's previous and subsequent testimonies were inconsistent, and there was considered to be a major suspicion of "instigating murder." The reason why the Supreme Court sent the case back for a retrial in the past was because Zhao Guangfu's blackmail letter was quite questionable. Now, the High Court is investigating the case, relying only on the evaluation report of the clerk of the High Branch Court from more than ten years ago, and there is no other more powerful evidence to prove that it was written by Zhao. The determination that it was written by Zhao's own hand is inconsistent with the original intention of sending it back for a retrial. Furthermore, even if we assume that the letter was written by Zhao, why did Zhao not blackmail others, but only blackmail Gu Zhuxuan? There must be a reason for this, and it should be investigated. This blood case, which had come to an end, has "lingering echoes that never cease" due to the prosecutor's appeal.</p>
<h3 id="e97">Landing Craft Robbed in Yingkou, Over 20 Dead, Injured, and Missing; Crew Unions Hold Emergency Meeting and Resolve to Petition for Thorough Investigation of Responsibility <a href="#e97" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c97" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">97</a></h3>
<p>[Our Report] The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company’s Landing Craft No. 105 was detained by bandits in Yingkou on the 28th of last month. It escaped on the 4th of this month and was towed back to Huludao by the Ji Ping. Then, it was towed to Tianjin and is currently undergoing repairs there. These details have already been reported in previous editions. It is now known that the vessel was bombarded when it escaped from Yingkou, causing damage to the hull, resulting in the deaths of four crew members and injuries to three others. Eighteen people, including the chief mate, Sun Jibo, are missing and their whereabouts remain unknown. The bureau is currently making efforts to handle the aftermath for the dead and injured, and is also investigating the missing. Five senior crew unions, including those for merchant ship masters and marine engineers, believe that the authorities mishandled the incident involving the landing craft, arguing that the vessel should not have been forced to sail to that area, leading to its detention by bandits. They convened an emergency meeting the day before yesterday (the 21st) and resolved to send a letter to the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, stating that guarantees should be provided to crew members when vessels are dispatched in the future. They also submitted three points to the Ministry of Transportation: (1) Request the government to thoroughly investigate responsibility and severely punish responsible officials; (2) Send a letter to the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, offering generous compensation to the families of the victims (in accordance with the Maritime Law, three times the amount of compensation);</p>

<p>(3) Also, the shipping companies (organized with vessels compensated by the government for private sector losses) have already sent personnel to the United States to receive new ships. It is heard that they are planning to hire foreign senior crew members on a long-term basis, which should be actively resisted. The five senior crew unions believe that shipowners are opposing the opening of inland river shipping routes on the one hand, while on the other hand, they are protecting their own interests and depriving Chinese crew members of their livelihood, which is contradictory. Moreover, in the past year, as many as seven Chinese merchant ships have been sunk and lost due to the dereliction of duty of foreign captains. The intentions of the shipowners are unknown and difficult to understand, so further discussions will be held to devise countermeasures.</p>

<p>[Our Report] Since the beginning of spring, low pressure and cold air currents have been alternating over the coastal area, causing continuous rain and cold spring weather in the city. According to weather forecasts, today will still be cloudy and cold, with light rain. It may become overcast in the evening. There will be strong northerly winds outside Wusongkou. The cold air currents have been repeatedly lingering and not retreating in recent days, so the arrival of a warm spring may still have to wait. Yesterday's temperature: minimum 5.8 degrees Celsius (42.5 degrees Fahrenheit), maximum 12.2 degrees Celsius (54.0 degrees Fahrenheit).</p>

<p>[Our Report] Yesterday evening at 8:30 PM, on City Public Utility Bureau Bus No. 330, Route 13, as it arrived at Xieqiao Station from the South Wharf Station, three navy soldiers requested to board the bus. At that time, the bus was already extremely crowded, so conductor No. 756 asked them to take a later bus. However, the soldiers refused and insisted on boarding, eventually leading to an argument and then a conflict. The conductor was injured on the spot. At the same time, the buses that followed, upon hearing the news, stopped one after another, and some of the passengers also joined the fight. When the military police arrived, they took both parties to the police station for investigation. The navy soldiers involved, Lin Shouyue and Chen Xuehui, were sent to the Military Police Corps. That night, they, together with the City Public Utility Bureau and the navy's Shanghai-based agency, mediated the matter, which was resolved late at night. The injured conductor was sent to the Kung Chi Hospital.</p>
<h3 id="e103">Suspected Grafting in Rice Distribution; Zhang Sen, Chief of the Changning District Bao, Transferred to the District Prosecutor's Office for Investigation <a href="#e103" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c103" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">103</a></h3>
<p>[Our Report] The Civil Affairs Bureau yesterday transferred the case of Zhang Sen, chief of the Changning District Bao, who was accused of corruption in rice distribution, to the District Prosecutor's Office for investigation. According to the bureau's letter, "The Shanghai Municipal Food Allocation Committee stated in its official letter that, according to the report submitted by the personnel dispatched by the committee to Changning District to supervise the second phase of rice distribution to the poor, Zhang Sen, chief of the 28th Bao in the district, handled the procedures improperly in several aspects. Three points were found: (1) Rice purchase certificates were withheld from those who had not paid military conscription consolation money. It was found that the rice purchase certificates of the residents of the Bao, including Huang Mecai, Hong Qinggao, Gong Yuren, Chuan Rongsheng, Jin Weidian, Gu Junhao, Zhou Shaozhi, and Chen Jinyuan, totaling thirteen large-size certificates, were withheld. According to Zhang Sen, this was because they had not paid the military conscription consolation money, resulting in the delayed issuance of rice purchase certificates. However, rice allocation and military service are two separate matters and are not related to each other, so the withholding of rice purchase certificates was inappropriate. (2) Rice purchase certificates of relocated poor people were not returned, but were transferred without authorization. Certificates were not issued to those whose names were on the roster, but were issued to those whose names were not on the roster. According to Zhang, the rice purchase certificates of relocated households were transferred to newly relocated households. However, the Bao had not created a roster for reporting and verification, indicating that there was private transfer of rice purchase certificates. (3) The rice purchase certificates were issued according to the household registration, not based on the roster approved by the committee, which violated the original intention of the committee to issue rice to the poor."</p>

<h3 id="e109">Suspected Businesses of Illegally Exchanging Foreign Currency Request Unfreezing of Funds; The Municipal Chamber of Commerce Appeals to Authorities on Behalf of Transit Merchants <a href="#e109" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c109" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">109</a></h3>
<p>[Our Report] On the 26th of last month, the Municipal Financial Administration, together with the Municipal Police Bureau, investigated 41 businesses suspected of illegally exchanging foreign currency. The responsible persons of each business were released on bail after being taken to the bureau for questioning, but their accounts and funds were frozen pending review. The Municipal Transit Merchants Association stated that the case involved many of its members and sent a letter to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, requesting it to uphold justice and quickly devise effective measures to negotiate with the competent authorities to unfreeze the funds first, stating: "Members of the association are engaged in transit trade and are entrusted by merchants from various regions.</p>
<p>After handling the goods, they are transferred to various destinations. The funds for the goods are returned by the merchants to facilitate turnover, which is customary. The methods of returning funds include direct remittances from the merchants, transfers entrusted by the merchants, direct remittances from the merchants' locations, and transfers entrusted by merchants in other locations. The circumstances vary. In essence, the handling of goods is the business of the members of the association, and the return of funds is the business of the entrusting merchants. The members of the association have no right to interfere in the source of funds or the method of returning them, nor can they interfere. Moreover, merchants rely on the use of funds as their lifeline, so when merchants' payments are received, they must be accepted quickly, and there is no reason to refuse or delay acceptance. The main reason for the involvement of the members in this case is that the source of funds and the method of returning them are unclear, leading to suspicions of gold and silver sales or black market foreign exchange transactions. The situation regarding the collection and payment of goods by members of the association has been described above. Unless the competent authorities have found solid evidence, how can they immediately accuse them of violating the law? Moreover, the inflow of funds, regardless of whether they come from any place, even from abroad, is not the same as the escape of funds. Those who receive the funds are not guilty of any offense. In this incident, some people have been detained for more than six or seven days, and all the funds of the businesses involved have been frozen. There is no prospect of when the funds will be unfrozen. If the funds are unfrozen only after the case is over, after several months, all the funds will be lost. (Omitted below)."</p>
<p>After receiving the letter, the Chamber of Commerce stated that, according to the facts presented, the funds received by the transit merchants were purely funds returned by the merchants. If the funds were frozen for a long time, the merchants would be unable to operate, leading to closure and bankruptcy, which would be detrimental to the protection of industry and commerce. Yesterday, the Chamber of Commerce sent a letter to the Municipal Financial Administration and the Municipal Police Bureau, requesting them to unfreeze the funds of the transit merchants and hoping that similar measures would not be taken again in the future for similar incidents, except for legal investigations.</p>

<p>[Our Report] At around 9:00 PM on the 21st, a lone thief broke into the home of Ren Zhang, a driver for the Minsheng Motor Company, at No. 7 Xiangmao Lane, Damuqiao, Nanshi. Under the pretext of asking questions, he forced open the door, took out a sharp knife, and threatened Ren's wife. As a result, he robbed a pair of gold bracelets, four gold rings, and one pound of thread before escaping. When Ren returned home at 11:00 PM, he learned of the incident from his wife, who said that the thief looked familiar and had visited the house once before. After thinking it over, Ren determined that it was Xu Fengqing, a former colleague from the Minsheng Motor Company. He reported the incident to the Changshu Police Precinct and requested an arrest. Officer Yu Zhiming led police officers Liu Guansen and others to search for the suspect. They first arrested Xu's mistress and then captured Xu at Room 34, Aiwen Hotel, Beijing West Road.

<h3 id="e112">The Magic of Automatic Telephone Connections <a href="#e112" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c112" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">112</a></h3>
<p>[Our Special Report] In recent years, almost all citizens who use the telephone daily have experienced the difficulty of getting through, especially during office hours in the central district. Often, after picking up the phone, one has to wait a long time to hear the dial tone. Everyone knows that this is the result of congested lines. But what exactly is meant by "congestion"?</p>
<p>Yesterday afternoon, the Shanghai Telephone Company invited reporters from various newspapers to visit the Baxianqiao Exchange and the Fujian Road Exchange, giving us a rough understanding of the telephone communication process.</p>
<p>There are currently more than 60,000 telephone lines in Shanghai (excluding "02"). The connection of these lines is done entirely by automatic rotary machines. Each telephone call, from dialing to connecting, goes through eight different components. The process is like a traveler taking a train. Picking up the phone is like a traveler entering the train station and asking where to buy a ticket. At this time, someone comes forward to help with the luggage, which is equivalent to the line-finding machine in the automatic machine starting to find a line. The user is found by the line-finding machine in a few seconds and connected to the transceiver, just like a porter leading the traveler to the ticket office. After the user is connected to the transceiver, a humming sound can be heard, indicating that the traveler can explain his destination to the ticket office. The desired number is dialed on the dial, and the transceiver connects to the other party through the selector according to these five numbers. This is like the ticket office at the train station arranging the itinerary on behalf of the traveler according to the traveler's wishes, passing through several platforms to reach the destination. The line-finding machine and transceiver each have two sets, and the selector has four sets, so each telephone connection goes through eight sets of machines.</p>
<p>Due to Equipment Limitations, Lines Are Often "Full"</p>
<p>Due to the current limitations of the equipment, every 100 telephone lines are handled by 14 line-finding machines. If 14 lines are in use at the same time, the 15th line will not be able to connect. So, when you pick up the phone and do not hear the dial tone, it means that 14 of the 100 lines in your group have already occupied the line-finding machines, and you must patiently wait until one of the lines becomes available before you can take its place. Because the population of Shanghai has increased dramatically after the war, the telephone fees are relatively low, and the traffic congestion, economic situation, and financial situation are chaotic, the amount of telephone usage has greatly increased. In the central district, each line is used an average of 20 times a day (New York telephone lines average 7 times a day), while the existing equipment is still based on the 1926 standard of 5 times per line per day, so it is naturally not enough. In other words, the 14 line-finding machines for every 100 lines are often all "full," which is why it often takes so long to make a phone call.</p>
<p>Equipment for 10,000 Lines Is Gradually Arriving</p>
<p>The telephone company is currently expanding its equipment. The first batch of equipment and materials ordered from abroad for 10,000 lines has arrived, and assembly has begun in the assembly plant of the Baxianqiao Exchange. These machines were manufactured in underground factories during the war by the French branch of the American International Telephone and Telegraph Corporation and are still arriving in succession. It will take about a year to fully assemble and apply them. The future distribution will be approximately 1,000 sets for numbers beginning with 8, 500 sets for numbers beginning with 9, over 4,000 sets for numbers beginning with 6, and over 2,000 sets for numbers beginning with 4. The rest will be only a small number. Last year, the company ordered another 15,000 lines, but due to foreign exchange difficulties, they cannot be imported in the short term. According to recent statistics, more than 30,000 households have registered with the company to install telephones.</p>
<p>Forgetting to Hang Up the Phone Causes the Green Light Bulb to Light Up</p>
<p>The operation of the machines for controlling users is truly magical. Every time a line is used, the recording machine will turn over a number. If the user fails to pay the telephone bill on time, as long as a plug is inserted into the user's line, they will be unable to make a call. If the user forgets to hang up the phone after using it, the green light bulb on the user's line on the monitoring machine will light up. If the phone is taken off the hook and the dial is not dialed for more than two minutes, a white light bulb will light up. At this time, the telephone company staff will immediately notify the user on the line or issue a strange sound warning on the user's line.</p>
<p>The coating of telephone lines is now gradually being changed to Pastie, which Shanghai people call "glass." The advantage of this type of wire is that it is heat-resistant, durable, beautiful, and does not leak electricity. In the near future, all telephone lines can be completely replaced.</p>
<p>97222 Will Prompt You to Wake Up on Time</p>
<p>In terms of service, in addition to the "01" repair service, the "09" telephone number inquiry service, the "00" emergency service, and the "95678" time report service, which are already familiar to the public, there is also the "97222" wake-up service and the answering service. If users must get up early on a certain day to catch a plane, train, ship, or other important matter and are afraid of oversleeping and missing their appointment, they can call "97222" to notify them in advance. The service can call on time to prompt them to get up. Also, if users go out of town with their whole family and there is no one at home to answer the phone, they can call this number to inform them. Afterwards, when someone calls, the service can answer and record the message on their behalf. The wake-up service is completely free, while the answering service is charged a fee.</p>
<p>Automatic Dialing Machines; Only Two in Shanghai</p>
<p>In addition, there are two new types of equipment. One is an automatic switchboard, which allows telephone users with many extensions to do without a switchboard operator. The other is an automatic dialing machine, which can automatically dial 50 numbers. This is for people who frequently make calls, saving them the trouble of dialing the numbers themselves. There are only two of these machines in Shanghai, and one has already been rented out.</p>

<h3 id="e114">Could the Circulating Notes Stand Firm? A Disputed Question <a href="#e114" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c114" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">114</a></h3>
<p>[Our Shenyang Office Dispatch, 20th] Since the Ministry of Finance announced the regulations for exchanging the Northeast Circulating Notes on February 15th, opinions have differed, and there has been much debate. People in the Northeast generally believe that the disadvantages outweigh the advantages, causing unrest. A country's monetary system should be unified, and the special status should be broken sooner or later. However, the prolonged internal strife has prevented the realization of the ideal of reorganizing the Northeast currency system. The transitional measures announced by the Ministry of Finance are not entirely satisfactory. I would like to offer my humble opinions on the issuance basis, destabilizing factors, different viewpoints, and the impact of the new measures regarding the circulating notes.</p>
<p>Issuance Basis</p>
<p>After the recovery of the Northeast, the government carefully considered the implementation of the circulating note system, weighing the situation at the time. The separation of the currency systems inside and outside Shanhaiguan could ensure a more stable standard of living for the people of the Northeast. On the other hand, the Northeast is rich in resources with unlimited potential, and the barrier between currencies inside and outside Shanhaiguan would help the development of economic undertakings in the Northeast. To summarize, the basis for issuing circulating notes can be roughly divided into three points:</p>
<p>(1) At the beginning of the takeover, there were 12 billion yuan of puppet Manchukuo currency circulating in the market. It was difficult to determine the exchange rate between the legal tender and the Manchukuo currency for a while. The issuance of legal tender outside Shanhaiguan would inevitably cause financial chaos. Therefore, the Northeast Nine Provinces Circulating Notes were issued. The exchange rate with the legal tender was announced by the Central Bank on August 16, 1946, set at one to eleven and a half yuan.</p>
<p>(2) To facilitate the plunder of resources in the Northeast, the Soviet army issued 9.725 billion yuan of Red Army notes in the Northeast (the figure notified by the Soviet side, which is generally doubted by the public). In the view of our government authorities, this tool of plunder should be limited to the Northeast for reorganization to prevent North China from being harmed. Prohibiting the issuance of legal tender outside Shanhaiguan had the significance of economic warfare. By the end of August 1946, the reorganization of the Red Army notes had come to an end.</p>
<p>(3) At that time, the general prices in the Northeast were much more stable than those inside Shanhaiguan. The issuance of legal tender with large denominations outside Shanhaiguan would inevitably disrupt this state and cause unrest in people's lives, which would hinder political and economic recovery. However, people with foresight had pointed out early on that the Northeast is a part of China, and the special circumstances could not exist for a long time. In terms of the monetary system, it would be better to allow the legal tender to be issued outside Shanhaiguan as soon as possible and used at the same time as the circulating notes, determine the exchange rate, and gradually recover the circulating notes. From an overall point of view, this is very reasonable.</p>
<p>Destabilizing Factors</p>
<p>In the past two years, due to the continued destruction of internal strife, not only has the ideal of reorganizing the Northeast currency system been shelved, but the foothold of the circulating notes has also been unstable. In terms of the objective environment, military and political expenditures are enormous, the complete recovery of the nine provinces is nowhere in sight, transportation is cut off, exports are impossible, and everything depends on imports. In terms of human factors, the exchange rate management is poor, black market exchange has not been eliminated, the circulating notes are flooded in Tianjin and Beijing, the black market is devalued, and the circulating notes in the occupied areas are used to purchase materials from the recovered areas at low prices. These factors have shaken the credibility of the circulating notes. At the same time, the misfortune of inflation in the Northeast has caused great shock and fright to the people. The speed of printing circulating notes cannot keep up with such huge expenditures. The increase in the number of currency issued cannot keep up with the increase in prices. This violent blow has made the people of the Northeast deeply resent the circulating notes psychologically, doubt the issuance reserves of the circulating notes based on the enemy and puppet industries in the Northeast, and also hold a "non-belief doctrine" towards the issuance figures of the circulating notes. This is a secret figure. Wang Huayi, one of the representatives of the Northeast petition group, announced a figure of 5 trillion in Nanjing. The financial authorities of the local headquarters had strictly denied it. According to more reliable figures, it is 500 billion yuan. Judging from the lack of chips in the Northeast, 500 billion yuan is more accurate. This figure is very different from the astronomical figure believed by the people of the Northeast. There are also many people who are worried that the circulating notes will encounter misfortune like the Manchukuo currency and the Red Army notes in the future, so they have no confidence at all. The wave of enthusiasm for reforming the currency system surged from the Northeast to Nanjing.</p>
<p>Different Viewpoints</p>
<p>The financial authorities do not agree with reforming the Northeast currency system at this time. Mr. Zhang Jia'ao has studied the issue of issuing large denomination circulating notes of 2,000 yuan in detail, which shows his prudence in handling financial issues. There are many reasons why they oppose the current reform, mainly the following:</p>
<p>(1) The interest rates inside Shanhaiguan are higher, and there is an abundance of floating capital. Once the dam of circulating notes is opened, the floating capital will flow in in large quantities, which is obviously detrimental to the industry and commerce inside Shanhaiguan.</p>
<p>(2) If the legal tender is issued outside Shanhaiguan, the currency in the Northeast will increase, and prices will inevitably rise more sharply, which will be detrimental to the lives of the general public.</p>
<p>(3) In view of the financial market fluctuations caused by the exchange of Soviet military tickets, the issuance of legal tender outside Shanhaiguan and the revision of the exchange rate will inevitably cause suspicion among the general public.</p>
<p>(4) However, no matter what method is adopted to reform the currency system, both currencies must be allowed to be used at the same time during the transition period. At the beginning, the Soviet military tickets were used to replace the Manchukuo currency in the recovered areas. Although the reorganization has been largely completed, the Soviet military tickets in other unrecovered areas still need to be reorganized. Due to military relations, the Manchukuo currency has not been fully recovered. If the legal tender is allowed to circulate again, it will increase the difficulty of reorganizing the currency system in the future.</p>
<p>Most local people hold the opposite view of the above viewpoints. They said that the Northeast is at the front line of national defense and it is extremely unfair to bear such huge war expenses alone, and it has reached the point where it is unable to bear it. The increasing devaluation of the circulating notes is making the people of the Northeast lose their property invisibly, so it must be reformed immediately.</p>
<p>The government authorities' position focuses on considering currency system issues from an economic point of view, while the local position is permeated with political emotions to measure it. Finance is a bridge between economics and politics, and the integration of the two depends on finance. Therefore, in handling currency system issues, there should be a long-term vision, detailed plans, deep understanding, and ample experience.</p>
<p>New Measures</p>
<p>The new measures promulgated by the Ministry of Finance on March 15 have been formally opposed by the Northeast provinces and cities' councils and civil groups. In the eyes of local people, the regulations restricting the use and exchange locations of circulating notes inside Shanhaiguan do not restrict the increase in the issuance of circulating notes. Therefore, the issuance of legal tender outside Shanhaiguan is of little benefit to the prices and people's livelihood in the Northeast. At the same time, the exchange rate between the legal tender and the circulating notes has been revised to one to ten, and the official price of the circulating notes has been devalued. The increase in the prices of public utilities such as postal and telecommunications is a good example.</p>
<p>The actual impact of the issuance of legal tender outside Shanhaiguan and the revision of the exchange rate of the circulating notes depends on the reaction after the Central Bank stipulates detailed measures for exchange and conversion. It is not appropriate to judge the gains and losses at this time, but three issues are worth noting:</p>
<p>(1) Will the circulating notes continue to be issued? Judging from the actual situation, it is probably impossible to stop the issuance. At present, there is a great shortage of chips in various parts of the Northeast, so that the salaries of public and private teachers and soldiers cannot be paid on time. It is quite difficult to transport a large amount of legal tender to the Northeast.</p>
<p>(2) Can the black market for circulating notes be eliminated? Since the exchange of circulating notes is strictly restricted inside Shanhaiguan, the large amount of circulating notes flowing into Shanhaiguan can only go to the black market. Assuming that the exchange rate in the Northeast is relaxed to the maximum extent, the inflow of circulating notes into Shanhaiguan cannot be avoided. For example, the vast area south of Jinzhou does not have internal exchange. At present, only the Beining Railway is open. Commerce is active. The exchange between Shanhaiguan and Beiping cannot meet the large demand. The black market cannot be eliminated. After the official price of the circulating notes is devalued, the black market will also be devalued.</p>
<p>(3) Although prices in the Northeast are at the peak of the country, the issuance of legal tender outside Shanhaiguan will still give it a strong stimulus. Since the 15th, food and cotton cloth have risen sharply, which is very obvious.</p>
<p>The circulating notes have become a disputed issue. The central position and the local position are obviously opposed. If we do not focus on fundamentally reorganizing the currency system, it is difficult to reconcile the two positions. In short, at such a tense military stage in the Northeast, arguing about the issue of circulating notes is of no great significance and there is no room for doubt. (Our reporter Zhao Zhan)</p>

<p>[Our Haikou Office Dispatch, 18th] The scourge of banditry in Hainan did not begin today. According to the pacification report publicly issued by the 46th Army in the past, as early as the period of the Republic of China in 1927, bandits had begun to operate on Hainan Island. By 1930, the bandit forces became more active. In 1937, when the war of resistance broke out, the bandits took the opportunity to form the "Hainan People's Self-Defense Group Independent Detachment." In February 1939, when the Japanese army landed, the bandits changed the independent detachment to the independent general detachment, with the permission of Wang Yi, the garrison commander at the time, and collected the guns of the people in Qiongshan, Wenchang, Chengmai, and Ding'an counties, as well as the original armed forces, and formed three battalions, one independent battalion, and one special service company. In April 1940, a group of more than 400 bandits from Zhuanggutian in southern Anhui sneaked to Wenchang and landed nearby. Since then, the bandit forces have grown day by day and actively expanded their armed forces and organization, dividing the general detachment into detachments, battalions, companies, etc. After 1943, the bandits had expanded from three detachments to five detachments. After the surrender of the Japanese army, because our side had not formally taken over, a state of anarchy was formed locally, and the bandits took the opportunity to operate again, and their power increased. Each county formed a Mengjin battalion, an independent battalion, etc., and each battalion expanded from 500 people to 1,000 people, scattered in the countryside to operate. The county was divided into districts, townships, baos, jias, and groups. Last year, the bandit army was ordered to be reorganized into the "Qiongya Column of the Chinese People's Liberation Army," and at the same time, the "Bandit Hainan Provincial Democratic Government" was established, with bandit leader Feng Baiju as commander and chairman of the provincial government. According to the South China News Agency, the bandit army in Hainan Island has planned to increase to 15 detachments. However, in recent years, due to the constant suppression by the national army, the strength of the bandit side has been reduced day by day. According to the people who escaped from the bandit area, most of the guns used by the communists are home-made powder guns, which shows that their internal situation is empty. Recently, the bandits have once again pretended to cover up their increasingly defeated signs and ran in different ways to Lingao Cui County, trying to create terror and disturb the people's hearts, but after being severely damaged by our army, the bandits have collapsed in a panic. According to the Qingxiang Department News Group, their ultimate goal is nothing more than plundering materials and disrupting order.</p>

<p>[Our Chengdu Office Dispatch, 16th] Since the provincial government announced the implementation of a wartime system in Sichuan Province this year and the establishment of the Sichuan Province Pacification and National Construction Mobilization Committee, it shows that Sichuan has entered a wartime state from peacetime. The deployment of troops on the Daba Mountains, the most important issue for the current provincial administration in Sichuan, has long been of concern to compatriots across the country. Thanks to the sincere cooperation between the military and civilians and the government in Sichuan in recent months, the copper wall and iron wall of Sichuan's defense has been built, which will also shatter the communist bandits' dream of spying on Sichuan. Chairman Deng Xihou once firmly and optimistically told reporters that he wanted to "settle the people within the Daba Mountains and keep the bandits outside the Daba Mountains." From the recent deployment trends in Sichuan, I can see the whole picture of Sichuan's defense and share his firm confidence.</p>
<p>Two Defense Lines, Three Major Projects</p>
<p>The defense line of Sichuan Province starts from Motianling on the border of Sichuan and Gansu, along the Micang Mountains to the Daba Mountains. This is the Daba Mountain National Defense Line bordering Sichuan, Gansu, Shaanxi, and Hubei. It is divided into two defense lines. The first defense line includes Pingwu, Qingchuan, Guangyuan, Zhaohua, Nanjiang, Wanyuan, Chengkou, and Wushan. The second line includes Beichuan, Jiangyou, Jiange, Mianyang, Zhangming, Cangxi, Yilong, Bazhong, Daxian, Kaijiang, Xuanhan, Yunyang, and Fengjie. The deployment work on these two winding and long national defense lines is arduous. The Sichuan Provincial Government has launched a moving military-civilian cooperation, mobilizing millions of migrant workers: The first step is to rush to repair bunkers. Within a month, more than 1,500 bunkers were completed, of which 50 were giant chain-style, and there were telecommunications, waterways, and transportation lines connecting the forts, towering in the Daba Mountains. The second step is to form a highway network, rush to repair the arc-shaped national defense highway around northeastern Sichuan, and plan to complete the first phase of the project: (1) Nan (bu)-Ba (zhong) Line, (2) Wan (xian)-Kai (xian) Line, (3) Tong (jiang)-Nan (jiang) Line, the total length of the three lines is 585 kilometers. The second phase of the project is to complete: (1) Tong (jiang)-Qing (jiangdu) Line, (2) Guang (yuan)-Wang (cang) Line, (3) Liang (shan)-Kai (jiang) Line, the total length of the three lines is 190 kilometers. At present, the "Daba Mountain National Defense Highway Survey Team" is conducting a survey and mobilizing 100,000 migrant workers to implement the project. The third step is to deploy telecommunications, set up a communications network between special commissioner areas, counties, and townships within the defense area on the two defense lines. From Guangyuan, Dawu, and Bazhong, we will build a 2,400-kilometer-long power line. The funds are included in this year's local budget and are being rushed to repair. Bunkers, highways, and telecommunications are the material defense lines of Sichuan.</p>
<p>The People of Sichuan and Sichuan are Mobilized</p>
<p>As the spiritual defense line of Sichuan, the provincial government has mobilized the great and unparalleled manpower of the two Sichuan provinces; The first step is to launch a local self-defense movement, first in the prefecture and counties where the defense is set up, organize volunteer police teams and self-defense brigades, gradually register civil guns, investigate household registration, organize and train the people, and all people aged 18 to 45 are incorporated into the self-defense force to receive training and participate in the work of protecting their hometowns and defending the country. The second step is to implement the national compulsory labor, mobilizing nearly one million migrant workers to repair bunkers, highways, and telecommunications, three major defense projects. The third step is to launch a general movement for knowledgeable youth to join the army, calling on the passionate youth of the two Sichuan provinces to shoulder the task of pacifying the chaos and building the country. Initially, 200 youths were mobilized to join the camp in each county, but the actual number has now exceeded the target. The fourth step is to mobilize various specialized talents to participate in the promotion of various national defense engineering projects. The provincial government recently specially set up a "Talent Coordination Association" to handle this work. Sichuan contributed unparalleled manpower in the War of Resistance and created a glorious victory. Facts prove that the current compatriots in Sichuan have once again accepted the historical task, enthusiastically and generously, vying to serve in the military, and will write the glorious second page in the history of the War of Resistance and National Construction.</p>
<p>Four-Level Self-Defense, Three-Province Joint Defense</p>
<p>The defense plan implemented by the Sichuan Provincial Government: The first step is the widespread joint defense of counties and cities. 120 counties have implemented this, and 31 command posts have been established. The whole province is implementing a four-level self-defense system. The province is responsible for the security general team, the administrative special commissioner area is responsible for the security brigade, and the county and township are responsible for the police, so that each unit has the troop strength to be used flexibly. The second step is to implement the joint defense of the three provinces of Sichuan, Shaanxi, and Gansu. This month, Lin Shuen, the secretary-general of the Shaanxi Provincial Government, came to Rong and had specific discussions with Chairman Deng Xihou. A complete plan has been drafted. The joint defense counties include Bazhong and Tongjiang in Sichuan Province, Hanzhong and Baocheng in Shaanxi Province, and Xigu and Wudu in Gansu Province. The 27 counties are divided into the Sichuan-Shaanxi-Gansu Garrison Area. The third step is to equip the armed forces and divide the defense area. The whole province is divided into the eastern Sichuan and northern Sichuan garrison areas. Eastern Sichuan is based on Daxian, and northern Sichuan is centered on Guangyuan, and is divided into commander by Fang Jing and Huang Yin concurrently. In addition, the Guangyuan Forward Command Post is responsible for unifying the command of military and political affairs in northern Sichuan. In terms of armed forces, it is a matter of national defense secrets, but it is generally believed that in addition to local armed forces such as self-defense forces and local teams, the total military strength in Sichuan will never be less than eight divisions and ten security corps. The fourth step is to cooperate with other defense affairs. Air Force: It is reported that the Central Government will send ×× bombing teams to Sichuan, and the Huaxi base will be used for ×× mixed aircraft groups. Air defense: It has been decided to restore the air defense headquarters, and four command posts will be set up in Chongqing, Wanxian, Zigong, and Luxian. Other measures such as the emergency requisition of commercial vehicles, the borrowing of civil guns, and the recent registration by the provincial government of aviation, railway, telecommunications and various transportation and other engineering specialized talents all show the determination and efforts of the provincial government in promoting defense work in Sichuan.</p>
<p>Keeping Bandits Out, Settling the People Inside</p>
<p>As for the communist bandits' attempt to spy on Sichuan, the situation has changed due to the recent strict deployment and increased pressure from the national army. In the past, it was rumored that the bandit troops of Liu Bocheng, Chen Geng, Li Xiannian, and Kong Congzhou might sneak into Sichuan, but now Liu Bocheng and Chen Geng are trapped and embarrassed in the Dabie Mountains, Li Xiannian is cramped and gasping for breath in a corner of Chiefdom, and Kong Congzhou is fleeing in a panic to the border area of Shaanxi and Gansu. They are too busy to protect themselves, how dare they sneak west? At the same time, the establishment of the Henan-Hubei-Sichuan-Shaanxi Pacification Command has the greatest effect on the stability of Sichuan's defense. However, the Sichuan Provincial Government will never slack off in deployment due to the easing of the situation, because the Sichuan Provincial defense strategy is active. The highest principle of this strategy is Deng Xihou's declaration of "settling the people within the Daba Mountains and keeping the bandits outside the Daba Mountains." In Ming Dynasty, Gu Zuyu's Fang Yu Ji Yao defined Sichuan's defense in the first place as "Sichuan is not a place to sit and defend," and pointed out: "Defend with war, and the defense will be solid. Fight with defense, and the battle will be strong. Those who defend Jiange should not use Jiange, and those who defend Qutang should not use Qutang." He explained the principle of deployment "Setting up danger to gain people is the foundation, ensuring safety with wisdom is the first, people winning danger is the top, danger winning people is the bottom, and people and danger are equal, then we can get the middle strategy." The current defense work in Sichuan is being promoted based on these principles. Today, hundreds of thousands of troops have formed a copper wall and iron wall in the Daba Mountains. The healthy children of Sichuan have determined to eliminate the communist bandits outside the borders of Sichuan. If the communist bandits sneak in, the people of Sichuan believe that the towering and majestic Bashan Jiange will definitely be their burial place. (Our reporter Zhou Xueduan)</p>

<h3 id="e127">Looking Forward to the Dajia River: A Huge Power Source Three Times Stronger Than Sun Moon Lake <a href="#e127" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c127" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">127</a></h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Taipei, 18th Air Dispatch] He Wan has the only source of light - Sun Moon Lake, which has been shining powerfully for fifteen years, nourishing industry and farmland, and bringing vitality to the rulers. However, the requirements of the new era are forcing people to believe that Sun Moon Lake is gradually aging, and to re-invest in another new and great power source, which is the Dajia River Hydropower Station.</p>
<p>In coordination with the Japanese industrial plan, the 152,000 kilowatts of power generated by Sun Moon Lake is not enough to support it. They pinned their hopes on the Dajia River to develop the driving force for heavy industry. Not only is it limited to supplying the province, but it can also transmit light to Fujian through the Taiwan Strait. Originally, the Japanese held the ambition and illusion of permanent occupation.</p>
<p>The Dajia River is located in the central part of He Wan, with a length of 142 kilometers. It originates from Mount Cilai, which is more than 3,000 meters above sea level, and has the most abundant hydropower in the entire island. The plan is to build the Dajian High Dam and the Dajian Reservoir upstream as the hub. From Dajian downstream to the vicinity of Shigangzhuang, more than 60 kilometers away, using the huge drop of more than 1,200 meters, eight power plants will be established in succession. The combined power generation is 458,500 kilowatts. Because the Dajian Reservoir regulates the flow smoothly, the normal power generation is 321,000 kilowatts. It can support the main force for the development of heavy industry, and can also shoulder the tasks of flood control, water supply, and irrigation of 98,000 mu of paddy fields!</p>
<p>In February 1942, the Japanese Parliament approved the construction budget for the reservoir with a huge sum of 125 million Japanese yen. However, due to the lack of equipment and insufficient financial resources, it was impossible to avoid the setback of the project even if the construction standards were lowered, which led to the change of plan and the completion of the Meiji Highway and the construction of the railway from Fengyuan to Dongshi in 1943. The three power plants built by Taiwan Power Company, including Tianleng, Fengyuan First, and Meiji, also encountered the same fate. Among them, 80% of the civil engineering of Tianleng No. 1 Plant has been completed.</p>
<p>Taiwan Power Company is now handing over the civil engineering, which only needs to be completed by one-fifth, to the Provincial Engineering Company for execution. In September of the 35th year, the estimated cost of this project to be completed was about 210 million yuan, but now it needs more than 10 billion yuan (machines, etc. need about 10 million US dollars). This has to be said to be a large sum of money. Time has increased the value of this great project. The first phase of the project that the Engineering Company has decided to carry out is the longest No. 8 tunnel among all eleven tunnels (a total of 10 kilometers and 100 meters). Of the 3 kilometers and 100 meters of this aqueduct, the Japanese completed one-half, but those who receive this inheritance need to complete it. In the completed lower section of one kilometer, the water is usually deep enough to submerge the ankles, and in the rainy season, it becomes a flood. The project is unusually difficult, and the collapsed middle section needs to be rebuilt. The Engineering Company believes that this is not a technical problem, but whether the Wanli Company has sufficient funds and can be fully completed in three or five years after the current construction starts.</p>
<p>The preparation posture for this project has long been completed, and the Engineering Company also sent engineers to conduct on-site surveys last month. If this great and fruitful project can be started quickly, we should thank the American Reynolds Aluminum Company, because its cooperation with the Aluminum Company forces the Power Company to supply as much as possible to the largest customers in the province. Only in this way can the Dajia River emit light more than three times stronger than Sun Moon Lake, which is the starting point for Taiwan's heavy industry construction!</p>

<h3 id="e131">Wuxi Employees' Salaries Calculated in Rice: Employers Request Payment Based on the Cost of Living Index <a href="#e131" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c131" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">131</a></h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Wuxi, 21st Dispatch] The salaries of employees in factories and shops in this county are all based on rice as the standard. The price of rice has risen repeatedly, making it impossible to sustain. Recently, the wages of workers in three industries, including smelting, machinery, and casting, are related to the rice issue. The employers have requested to change the calculation based on the cost of living index. After repeated mediation, it has not been resolved and is still in a stalemate. The reason for the recent weakness in rice prices in Xidi is that the farmers are unable to pay for the resettlement expenses of the conscripts from the four rural areas, so they have to borrow food or transport the food stored at home to the city for sale in order to pay. Therefore, the food supply in the summer and autumn of this year will inevitably become more panic due to the sale of most of the rice in the countryside. It is hoped that the authorities will pay attention to this.</p>
<h3 id="e132">Deng Huamin Discusses the Reconstruction of the Southwest <a href="#e132" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c132" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">132</a></h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Chongqing, 16th Air Dispatch] Stepping into the magnificent building of the Tonghui Bank, we interviewed our friend from the financial community, Mr. Deng Huamin. The name Deng Huamin can be said to be not unfamiliar, because he is a senator, the newly appointed legislator of the Seventh District of Sichuan, and the chairman of Tongzhuan Industrial Bank, Sichuan Salt Company, and Chunmao Fa Wood Company. After graduating from the Hanover University of Technology in Germany, he returned to his home country and served as a professor at National Sichuan University. He then founded these businesses, from manager, general manager, to chairman, and reached his current position.</p>
<p>This young financier, of medium height, sturdy build, and ruddy complexion, does not appear particularly wealthy in his neat attire, but his simplicity and shrewdness are revealed in his actions and words. The reporter first inquired about his views on the reconstruction of the Southwest. He lowered his head and pondered seriously, and then said: "Speaking of the reconstruction of the Southwest, let's talk about a smaller area. I am from Sichuan, so let's talk about the construction of Sichuan. First of all, there are three basic problems: the first is the problem of fundraising, the second is the problem of construction focus, and the third is the problem of technical talent. Sichuan was originally a relatively backward economic area, and now all its industries and mines have developed to meet the needs of wartime, and have not grown slowly. Therefore, regardless of raw materials and markets, regardless of technology and talent, although it is a land of abundance and has abundant resources, it has not actually cultivated a self-reliant and autonomous foundation. Of course, we do not deny that there are some shortcomings in the industries and mines of Sichuan itself and in the surrounding economic environment. Building Sichuan is a major project, and it cannot be achieved by the efforts of one person or one place, but must be:</p>
<p>First, we must urge and assist the government to complete the great five-year construction plan.</p>
<p>Second, the government should support the excellent factories in Sichuan.</p>
<p>Third, the government should give preferential treatment to the factories that moved to Sichuan during the War of Resistance. For example, Japan's reparations to me have reached a concrete stage. Although the allocation numbers and allocation areas have not yet been officially announced, how to allocate them fairly and how to achieve practical results is a problem that our southwest industries and mines should and must pay attention to." Finally, he also mentioned that the United States launched a westward movement at one time. He said: "The reconstruction of Sichuan not only does not have the obstacles of the westward movement, but also has the superior conditions lacking in the westward movement, because human resources, material resources, and financial resources have the economic foundation of wartime, which is twice the result with half the effort."

<p>[Shenzhou News Agency] Dr. Shen Jiarui, a full-time researcher at the Institute of Zoology of the Peiping Research Institute, was invited by the British Council to go to England for inspection last September. Shen has completed his inspection and returned to Shanghai on the 20th of this month aboard the Huarui. According to Dr. Shen's conversation with reporters about his research and inspection experience in England, he went abroad last September and visited Portsmouth, Scotland, and other places. He also visited the Institute of Zoology, Institute of Oceanography, and Museum of various universities, and talked with experts from other countries and exchanged experiences, which was very beneficial. In Portsmouth, he studied the color-changing crustacean crabs at the Marine Biological Laboratory for a month. After that, in December, he was invited by the International Society of Biology to visit and study in Paris. This time when he returned to China, he brought back three large boxes of the latest zoology books, about thousands of copies. It is said that the British Labor Party government is implementing two major policies: (1) to do its best to solve domestic social problems, so that everyone can be employed, and the unemployed will receive subsidies; (2) to strive to increase production, step up the training of scientific talents, and support them, so that theoretical science and applied science are integrated. For example, the United Kingdom lacks meat, and it is trying its best to set up more fishing industry institutions on the coast, and the institute uses fish to supplement them. Artificial insemination is widely used to increase the number of dairy cows and increase milk production. Science students go to factories for internships, and the British government has specially increased the budget for scientific research. Dr. Shen said that the British are afraid that scientific backwardness will become a third-class country, so they pay special attention to advanced scientific research such as atomic energy and electron microscopes. Dr. Shen was also warmly welcomed and entertained in Hong Kong and Singapore. He is scheduled to return to Peiping at the end of the month and will preside over: (1) zoological classification work; (2) experimental zoology research work.</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] Kuang Zhongmou, the owner of the Penglai Market in southern Shanghai, founded Kuang Village Primary and Secondary Schools in Wuxi with his own funds during the late Qing Dynasty. Over the decades, the schools have gained a good reputation. Before the war, Kuang had the ambition to expand the schools into a university, and he purchased 400 mu of land in Gaogiao, Pudong, as a fund for establishing the university. Unfortunately, the plan was interrupted by the war. Twenty-six years later, most of the Penglai Market in this city was destroyed. It is reported that the market will soon be rebuilt, and the long-cherished Kuang Village University has decided to establish a preparatory committee to actively commence preparations, aiming to submit the plan to the Ministry of Education and begin enrollment before the summer vacation this year, in order to contribute to education.</p>

In the third and fourth games, the two sides fought at close quarters, and the score difference was always between one and two points. Huayan led all the way, but the Air Transport generals struggled hard. Finally, they lost the opportunity with 23 to 25 and 21 to 23. In conclusion, Huayan won 3 to 1. Although the Air Force lost, the performance was still very exciting. The scores of the four games were: 21-10, 16-21, 25-23, 23-21.</p>

<h3 id="e172">Silver Market Tightens, Merchants Sluggish, Rice Prices Continue to Fall Yesterday, Civil Affairs Council Attempts to Sell Rice in the North Market but Finds No Bidders <a href="#e172" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c172" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">172</a></h3>
<p>[Our Report] Yesterday, the rice market experienced another round of tight credit. Prices in the production areas of Suzhou and Wuxi reported declines again, leading to a sharp drop in the local market. At the opening, prices fell by over ten thousand, and merchants were quite sluggish. Sellers had to lower prices to attract buyers. Later, prices for all types of rice reported small declines, further depressing market sentiment, creating a situation where supply exceeded demand. White japonica and early Ping rice in the North and South markets both fell by 200,000 yuan, with some prices falling by 300,000 yuan compared to the previous day. White japonica rice in the North market was at 3.75 million yuan, thin rice at 3.65 million yuan, and special high-quality japonica also fell below the 4 million yuan mark. The total amount of rice arriving in the North and South markets was 7,275 stones.</p>
<p>Another Report: The Civil Affairs Council continued to sell large quantities of rice yesterday to suppress rising rice prices. Originally, early rice was scheduled to be sold in the North market, but because rice prices slightly decreased, the selling price was automatically lowered by 200,000 yuan to 3.4 million yuan. However, due to weak market sentiment, there were no bidders, and not a single grain of rice was sold. Since the Civil Food Allocation Council began comprehensive per capita rice rationing, it has never sold rice on the market. Recently, due to the prolonged storage of rice in warehouses and the arrival of 134 newly arrived shiploads of rice, some of which were not suitable for long-term storage, an inspection revealed that 1,235 stones were slightly damp. Therefore, the Council entrusted the North Rice Market Management Committee to sell this rice. However, due to the excessive drop in rice prices yesterday, the sale was temporarily unsuccessful. It is also understood that the rice rationed for April and June in this city will be entirely American relief rice. The rice rationed for May will be Siamese rice. According to the person in charge of the Council, the supply of grain exceeds demand, and plans are currently being drafted to directly protect sales and prevent a sharp drop in grain prices.</p>
<p>Flour sales were sluggish, and merchants were less inclined to buy. Amid continuous sales calls, the prices of all brands of flour fell to their limits. Lao Che and Bingshen flour each fell sharply by 115,000 yuan, while Hongfeng and Jiancheng flour also fell by 110,000 to 120,000 yuan. Miscellaneous brands of flour were quiet due to slow sales. At the close, Lao Che warehouse slips were at 1.475 million yuan, delivered at 1.49 million yuan, and Bingshen warehouse slips were at 1.46 million yuan. Large bags of bran fell below 800,000 yuan, a decrease of 75,000 yuan. Wheat factory disks were at 2.3 million yuan.</p>
<p>A wave of price declines swept across miscellaneous grains. Due to the preceding fall in rice prices, miscellaneous grains followed suit. Soybean merchants were not buying. Hankou Zhadou opened at 1.9 million yuan, but the Dachang New Oil Factory reduced the price to 1.85 million yuan at the close, with 300 bags traded, a decrease of 200,000 yuan. Although corn prices rose sharply the previous day, yesterday's decline was also severe, falling by 200,000 to 300,000 yuan. Red sorghum also fell by 200,000 yuan. Mung beans and sesame both fell by 200,000 yuan. Uncooked peanuts saw even less merchant interest, falling by another 300,000 to 400,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Edible oil prices plummeted, mainly because soybean and other miscellaneous grain prices all fell, causing market sentiment to be very weak. With credit tightening again, sellers had no choice but to lower prices to sell their goods. As the decline intensified, merchants became more cautious, and the market experienced a rapid downward spiral. Qingdao Ji bucket oil opened at 9.25 million yuan, then fell to 9.1 million yuan, a sharp drop of 500,000 yuan. Basket crude oil saw a few transactions at 8.65 million yuan. Dayou Factory opened with soybean oil at 7.65 million yuan, but returning goods quickly fell to 7.55 million yuan. Datong soybean oil opened at 7.6 million yuan, but returning goods were as low as 7.5 million yuan, each falling by 450,000 yuan. Raw sesame oil fell by 450,000 yuan. Raw vegetable oil initially fell by 300,000 yuan, and the market continued to decline. Small car sesame oil fell the least, at 300,000 yuan.

<h3 id="e181">Tea Market Firm and Stable <a href="#e181" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c181" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">181</a></h3>
<p>Since the strong buying interest in the tea market has continued to spread, the process has not slowed down at all. Unfortunately, the remaining stocks of each type of tea are still scarce, so trading remains limited due to the lack of supply.</p>
<p>In terms of prices, sellers wanted to raise prices again, but because tea prices had risen sharply and continuously, they felt powerless to raise them further. As a result, the market turned to a firm and stable trend. However, according to general opinion, because old tea is almost sold out and the production period for new tea is still far away, there is still hope for further progress in the future.</p>

<h3 id="e188">Domestic Opening of Self-Provided Foreign Exchange Has No Impact on Hong Kong Market <a href="#e188" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c188" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">188</a></h3>
<p>Hong Kong News, Regarding the opening of self-provided foreign exchange, local sources have received news from Shanghai that the General Transportation Management Council will hold a regular committee meeting in Shanghai, and Minister of Finance Yu Hongjun will also go to Shanghai to participate. The main purpose of the meeting is to discuss the partial opening of self-provided foreign exchange in order to use the deposits of Chinese people abroad and facilitate remittances from overseas Chinese to import production equipment and industrial raw materials and chemical products needed in the country. The main method is to use the deposits of Chinese people abroad and guide the escape of funds abroad to increase domestic production. However, it is stipulated that this self-provided foreign exchange is limited to foreign deposits before the end of December last year in order to prevent capital outflow and disrupt the financial market. Detailed measures are still being drafted. Yesterday, reporters asked local commercial leaders about this issue. According to their opinions, the import of self-provided foreign exchange will have no practical benefit to the Hong Kong market. Because the so-called self-provided foreign exchange has approximately the following two sources: (1) Overseas remittances (excluding Hong Kong) (2) Export exchange settlement. In terms of overseas remittances, overseas Chinese, especially US remittances, mostly remit US dollar checks directly back to Taiwan, and then transfer them to Hong Kong for storage. They have no confidence in either national currency or Hong Kong dollars, so it is doubtful whether encouraging overseas remittances to import production equipment will achieve the desired effect in the future. Moreover, Shanghai news said that it is limited to foreign deposits before the end of December last year, and there are many troubles in proving it. As for export exchange settlement, 20% is sold to the government, and 70% is freely allocated by merchants.</p>

In addition, in order to control materials on behalf of the government, agricultural warehouses will be established in grain and cotton production areas to handle the storage and pledge of agricultural products. The interest rate for agricultural loans is set at 7% per month, and loan procedures will be simplified as much as possible. Li Shuming, General Manager of the Bank, believes that agricultural loans cannot be delayed any longer because spring plowing is imminent. He took a train to Shanghai on the evening of the 22nd to discuss mortgage transfers with the Central Bank. It has been decided that the bank will raise 10% of the head office, and 90% will be transferred by the Central Bank. Once the contract is signed, funds can be allocated. Each branch of the Farmers Bank will start lending next week.</p>

<h3 id="e192">Banks Believe That the Joint Liability of the Introducer of Check Accounts Is Difficult to Comply With <a href="#e192" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c192" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">192</a></h3>
<p>[Our Report] The Shanghai Bank Commercial Industry Association convened a meeting of the standing council yesterday, chaired by Li Ming. The following important cases were discussed and approved: (1) According to banking law, half of the deposit guarantee reserve can be offset by bonds, etc. It was decided to submit a request to the Ministry of Finance to allow this. (2) The Ministry of Finance stipulates that the business income tax for profit-making enterprises should be collected at six times the amount levied last year. However, the operating income of the financial industry has not increased six times compared to last year, and it was decided to submit a request to the Ministry of Finance to require collection based on the actual amount collected in the account. (3) Regarding the guarantee responsibility that the introducer of the check user should bear, according to the Financial Management Bureau's explanation, he should bear the responsibility of determining the identity and address of the check user. If the check user has any illegal activities, he should bear the joint responsibility. The industry believes that this is difficult to comply with.</p>
<h3 id="e193">Shanghai Enamel Industry Requests Reduction in Antimony White Allocation Price <a href="#e193" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c193" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">193</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai enamel industry has recently experienced a decline in production and sales and a bleak future due to the lack of imported raw materials and the small number of quota allocations. The soaring allocation prices of domestic pure antimony and antimony white are also affecting exports. A special presentation was made to the Resources Committee requesting a special reduction and an increase in allocation to maintain production. The original presentation stated that pure antimony is an essential chemical raw material for the enamel industry, and the factories under the association need more than 40 tons per month. Since the start of allocation in August last year, half of the allocation was initially received, and the price was 7.5 million yuan per ton. After several requests, a quarter of the allocation was received for the second time in November, and the price had soared to 35 million yuan. Within two months, the allocation price for the third time increased to 46 million yuan. By the time of the fourth allocation on February 16th recently, it suddenly soared to 73 million yuan. During these six months, the first allocation price was ten times higher than the fourth. Although the fifth allocation has not yet been distributed, it is said that the price will soar even more shockingly, reaching more than 100 million yuan. However, during the same period, the selling price of finished enamel products has increased by less than three times, and the huge losses can be imagined. A review of the amount of pure antimony allocated four times shows that it only accounts for one-fifth of the actual amount required. The Foreign Trade Office's letter stated that regarding the pure antimony needed by the enamel industry, the sale of antimony white should be gradually changed, urging each factory to strive for improvement. When the antimony white allocation price is higher than pure antimony, it is not enough to show encouragement. If the allocation can be reduced, each factory should be advised to purchase a trial, etc. After the letter was replied, there has been no news so far, and the sound of another price increase is coming one after another. The factories all believe that changing to antimony white is dark and affects the beauty of the finished product. And the amount used is 30% more than pure antimony, although a little Chilean nitrate can be used less, but the nitrate price is lower, and the gains do not outweigh the losses. In terms of production, pure antimony is used to formulate enamel powder, which can produce more than 200 pounds per day, while antimony white can only produce less than 180 pounds. Therefore, the result will increase the cost of the product and block the way to foreign sales. It is requested that the antimony white allocation price be specially reduced, at least by 30% from the February price, in order to facilitate improvement. In the next allocation of pure antimony, please also increase the quantity and maintain the original price of the last time, do not soar again, in order to maintain production and benefit exports.</p>

<h3 id="e194">Drama and Literature <a href="#e194" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c194" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">194</a></h3>
<p>—</p>
<p>Engaging in drama requires a rich literary cultivation because drama is inseparable from literature. We know that the main branches of literature are poetry, prose, fiction, and drama; drama originally belongs to a branch of literature, but drama also assimilates other branches of literature; because drama itself is composed of poetry, prose, and fiction, drama presents poetry, prose, and fiction in three dimensions, so drama can be called a comprehensive art, and also a comprehensive literature.</p>
<p>Drama, whether musical or spoken, has a close relationship with poetry. Poetry can not only independently constitute a musical drama, but also embellish or regulate the atmosphere of a spoken drama, such as an interlude. Shakespeare used poetry to write dialogue. Early Chinese spoken dramas, like Tian Han's "Suzhou Night Talk," not only had dialogue that was poetry, but even the plot and atmosphere were poetic.</p>
<p>Prose is the same; prose can be used in the dialogue and artistic conception of drama. Prose is a literary style that emphasizes the beauty of words and the beauty of emotions, so a person who writes prose well will definitely write beautiful dialogue for dramas, and will definitely create subtle settings and atmosphere.</p>
<p>Fiction and drama are even more closely linked. A novel can be transformed into a drama because both novels and dramas have dialogue, plot, characters, and action. The difference lies only in the fact that drama is presented in a prominent way, while novels are depicted on a flat surface. With a foundation in writing novels, it is much easier to write dramas.</p>
<p>The above is about how drama creators must have literary cultivation, and the same is true for drama directors and actors. Because literature can help you increase your understanding, understanding how a line should be read to be harmonious; how a character's personality should be expressed to be emotional and flexible; how a plot should be interspersed to be appropriate and reasonable.</p>
<p>A playwright with literary cultivation creates dramas that are not only scripts suitable for performance, but also literary works that can be read. A director with literary cultivation inevitably rehearses dramas with a high artistic style. An actor with literary cultivation inevitably performs dramas without affectedness or artificiality.</p>
<p>Therefore, all drama workers must have considerable literary cultivation, even those who work on scenery, effects, and lighting. Because literature can help you understand how a set should be set up to coordinate with the plot; how an effect should be used to enrich emotions; how a light should be emitted to match the atmosphere.</p>
<p>As for how to cultivate literary cultivation, in addition to fully reading literary books, a playwright must especially engage in literary creation.</p>
<p>Reading literary books should not be done with a recreational mentality, nor should it be interrupted. One must sincerely, consistently, and even systematically appreciate the works of each era, each movement, and each author. After appreciating the good and bad of the works, then use a research attitude to analyze the works and analyze the author. Finally, one should strictly criticize, because criticizing other people's works is tantamount to warning oneself and encouraging oneself. Based on this reading spirit, one can not only directly help increase literary cultivation, but also raise a strong interest in writing.</p>
<p>To become an excellent playwright, it is best to experiment with writing literary works in various genres, such as poetry, prose, and fiction. Especially write more novels. Writing short stories lays the foundation for writing one-act plays because short stories have simple plots that can be turned into one-act plays. Writing long novels lays the foundation for writing multi-act plays because long novels have complex plots that can be turned into multi-act plays. Although novels and dramas have different forms, their essence is actually the same.</p>
<p>Of course, we cannot absolutely say that a drama worker cannot succeed without literary cultivation; he can succeed by relying on technical proficiency. However, dramas that succeed solely on technology ultimately lack flavor and substance. If literature is given equal importance with technology, then it can not only supplement the poverty of flavor, but also increase the weight of substance. Especially dramatic writing requires the edification of various branches of literature, and is also a successful combination of various branches of literature. Therefore, we dare to say absolutely that a playwright must have full literary cultivation.</p>

<p>— Zhao Jingshen</p>
<p>Illustrated Collection of Grimm's Fairy Tales</p>
<p>Ms. Wanda Gág passed away in June 1946, leaving behind her "More Tales from Grimm."</p>
<p>Children are very familiar with her because they are used to seeing the cats and rabbits she drew. Children wholeheartedly love the books she illustrated, and then pass them on to other children; in this way, she is immortal!</p>
<p>Zigrosser's preface says that she "completed this work only after painful endurance before this book was published." Her illustrations do not follow the predecessors, they are her own creations. Just looking at the famous "The Elves and the Shoemaker" attached here, you can know. These illustrations are extremely imaginative and humorous.</p>
<p>Her "Tales from Grimm" was published eleven years ago. This "More Tales" has only one relatively unfamiliar story, "The Dragon and His Grandmother." The others are well-known to boys and girls and can touch the memories and joys of children of any age. Among them are the German versions of "Sleeping Beauty" and "The Six Swans," Marie Sherlock's retelling of "The Wolf and the Seven Young Goats" (this retelling once made middle-aged people laugh in the United States), and "Clever Hans," a lovely story, and the German version of "The Shepherd's Nosegay."</p>
<p>Lagerlöf's Fairy Tales</p>
<p>The fairy tale "The Wonderful Adventures of Nils" by Swedish novelist Selma Lagerlöf has recently been translated into English.</p>
<p>This book is a natural science research material provided to children in Swedish elementary schools. Few school textbooks are as popular as this book. This book was written in 1903 and published three years later. It contains hundreds of illustrations, which are especially valuable.</p>
<p>Nils is a naughty child. He is already fourteen years old, does not like to study, has a bad heart, and is especially cruel to animals. Therefore, a goblin turns him into a goblin, smaller than the small animals he has abused. Now he must be pitied by the small animals! He passes through the fields, castles, cities, buildings, etc. of various parts of Sweden. At this time, he understands the life of forest animals and also understands how to be a person. Finally, he is willing to sacrifice for the birds, and because of his kindness, he is transformed back into a human being.</p>
<p>This story is expressed in the form of comic strips. This book benefits both the eyes and the mind.</p>
<p>This book is published by Pantheon Books, which publishes a famous children's literature work every year. In the past, it has published stories and legends from Germany, the Soviet Union, and Greece. This one published this year is also something we are eager to read.</p>
<p>The illustrations are drawn by Hans Baumhauer. The one attached here is of little Nils being beaten.</p>
<h3 id="e197">Characteristics of Qing Dynasty Painting <a href="#e197" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c197" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">197</a></h3>
<p>— Yu Jianhua</p>
<p>— And Wishing the 37th Art Festival in Advance</p>
<p>(1) Division of the Era</p>
<p>In history, the Qing Dynasty began in the first year of Shunzhi (1644) and ended in the third year of Xuantong (1911), totaling 367 years, which can be considered an independent era. However, in the history of painting, in terms of the changes in the schools and the shift in painting styles, the period from the Longqing and Wanli periods of the Ming Dynasty to the 25th year of Jiaqing in the Qing Dynasty should be regarded as an era, because the mainstream of painting in this era was landscape painting, and the style of landscape painting completely inherited Dong Qichang's method and did not change until the middle of the Qing Dynasty. During the transition between the Ming and Qing Dynasties, although there were many eccentric geniuses in the painting world who transcended the influence of the Dong school, such as Shitao, Shixi, Bada, Banqian, Qushan, and Jianjiang, although they each occupied a territory and had considerable influence at the time, they were only like warlords who were divided and soon disappeared, with no successors and not widespread. After Dong Qichang, the so-called Six Masters of the Qing Dynasty, the Four Wangs and Wu Yun, all inherited Dong's method, developed it greatly, and created a unified situation in the painting world. Therefore, when people talk about Qing Dynasty painting, they often attribute Shitao, Bada, and others to the Ming Dynasty loyalists, and take the Four Wangs and Wu Yun as representatives of the Qing Dynasty. Among them, the Lou Dong and Yushan schools flourished especially, and lasted throughout the Qing Dynasty's period of peace and prosperity. After Daoguang and Xianfeng, the Qing Dynasty had many misfortunes and the national power gradually declined, and the Four Wangs and Wu Yun's school also declined with it. The Qing Dynasty had not yet perished, but the Four Wangs' school had already perished. Even if there were artists, they were equal to old loyalists, insignificant.</p>
<p>(2) The Source of Qing Painting</p>
<p>The Six Masters, the Four Wangs and Wu Yun, all inherited Dong Qichang's style and dominated the Qing Dynasty, so Dong Qichang can be said to be the father of Qing Dynasty painting. Among them, the Six Masters also had slight differences. Wang Shimin, Wang Jian, and Wang Yuanqi can be said to be biological sons (this is based on the style; in reality, Wang Yuanqi was Wang Shimin's grandson), while Wang Shigu and Yun Nantian can be said to be cousins, and Wu Mojing can be said to be a distant cousin. So who was Dong Qichang's father? That was Huang Gongwang, one of the Four Masters of the Yuan Dynasty. After the Four Masters of Wen, Shen, Tang, and Qiu were at their peak, Dong Qichang specialized in learning from Huang Gongwang through Gu Zhengyi's introduction, and also incorporated the ink methods of his distant ancestors Mi Nan Gong and Dong Beiyuan, forming a unique style that was warm, elegant, and refined. The Three Wangs inherited it, and then made a living from Huang Gongwang. Luntai never dared to step out of Huang Gongwang's range in his life. The influence of this style spread so widely that it became "everyone a peak" and "every family a Dachi," thinking that there was no painting outside of Huang Gongwang, and that the paintings outside of Huang Gongwang were all heretical and absolutely unlearnable. Therefore, the painting world for more than 400 years from Longqing to the late Qing Dynasty can also be called the "Huang Gongwang Era."</p>
<p>(3) Political Influence</p>
<p>The Manchus entered the Pass and unified China. Although their military power was strong, their culture was immature. The codes and systems mostly followed the Ming Dynasty's norms. By the Kangxi and Qianlong eras, they encouraged literature, rectified politics, and launched eastern and western expeditions, greatly enhancing their power and creating the Qing Dynasty's golden age. In order to block thoughts and win people's hearts, the government summoned learned elders and compiled large books such as the "Siku Quanshu." Over a century, with political clarity and social tranquility, talented scholars gradually forgot the pain of national subjugation and lived happily under the peaceful culture. Therefore, all poetry, calligraphy, and painting strived for purity and harmony. As for promoting vigor, uniqueness, and stimulating styles, they gradually softened and became invisible. In addition, the emperors, such as Kangxi and Qianlong, were all fond of calligraphy and painting. Even Emperors Renzong, Xuanzong, and Wenzong, although in an era of domestic and foreign troubles, often lingered in calligraphy and painting in their spare time. The upper echelons set an example, and the atmosphere spread, so for a time, social customs all engaged in writing and painting in order to attach themselves to elegance. The number of painters was the greatest in history. Since the emperors liked painting, although there was no painting academy, there were titles such as Inner Court Attendants and Ruyi Pavilion to treat painters favorably. Since those above liked it deeply and advocated it vigorously, most painters, even if they did not intend to curry favor, could become famous for a time if they won the emperor's appreciation. Therefore, some people inevitably flocked to it. Even ordinary literati and scholars mostly wielded their pens and ink to cater to the emperor's favor and advance their careers. Emperor Kangxi especially liked Dong Qichang's calligraphy and painting, and collected them throughout the country, inscribed jade tablets and gold titles, and attached great importance to them. Wang Yuanqi inherited his family's learning and became a Minister of Agriculture. He was especially known to Emperor Kangxi and served as the director of the Painting and Calligraphy Manual Hall and the chief painter of the Southern Tour Map. Therefore, those who studied painting competed to go to his door, forming the so-called Lou Dong School, which opposed the Yushan School. Yuanqi devoted his life to studying Huang Gongwang, and those who learned from him did not dare to change him slightly. Therefore, Yuanqi's students spread all over the world, and Huang Gongwang's method also spread all over the painting world.</p>
<p>(4) Revival of Thought</p>
<p>Ming Dynasty loyalists such as Gu Yanwu criticized the formalism and the emptiness and uselessness of ancient studies. They vigorously advocated the theory of application to the world, cited the ancient to prove the present, and thus started the trend of textual research. The early Qing Dynasty emperors also used this kind of learning that exhausted the mind and forgot the present to consume and isolate the intelligence and talent of scholars. Therefore, for a time, the court and the public all advocated the Han learning of textual research and annotation, replacing the Song learning of idealism and taking the lead in the academic world. Because of the rise of the archaeological trend, the revival of ancient thought also developed greatly. It was believed that everything in the world was good if it was ancient, and the more ancient, the better. Literati and scholars, influenced by this academic atmosphere, when engaged in painting, naturally only revered the ancient. They did not dare to be clever, did not dare to express their own ideas, and did not dare to show novelty. They only worshipped the ancients and imitated the established methods. As long as it resembled ancient paintings, they were already complacent, pretending to be content with being able to get "the ancient people's foot odor" or being able to "breathe out of one nostril with the ancients." The atmosphere of copying and imitating permeated the national painting world. There was no method outside of copying and imitating, and no painting outside of copying and imitating. As a result, it became a process of "successive inheritance," "each time worse than the last," withered, empty, mediocre, and stale, creating the incurable disease of Qing painting.</p>
<p>(5) Schools of Flower and Bird Painting</p>
<p>The main schools of Qing Dynasty landscape painting are nothing more than Wang Yuanqi's Lou Dong School and Wang Shigu's Yushan School. As for flower and bird painting, it is not as simple as the schools of landscape painting. Although the influence of Qing Dynasty flower and bird painting is not as great as that of landscape painting, it is more vibrant than other paintings, such as Daoist and Buddhist figures. (1) Sketching from life—sketching flowers from life, without the need for drafts, learning from Zhao Chang's and Yi Yuanji's sketching methods. Although there are dozens of people in this school, there are no famous masters, so the influence is not very great. (2) Wang Wu—stable in position and bright in color, quite admired in the early Qing Dynasty. (3) Yun Nantian—an outstanding talent, considering the past and present, taking the Northern Song Dynasty's Xu Chongsi as the ancestor and creating a pure boneless style, elegant and refined, meticulous and gorgeous, with both lively posture and rich charm and scholarly interest. It became the orthodox school of flower painting, with a large number of scholars, known as the Changzhou School, which is the main school of Qing Dynasty flower painting. (4) Jiang Tingxi—has the title of Nansha School, his brush and ink are more heavy and regular than Nantian's, either strange or upright, either colored or ink-washed, all can be integrated naturally. His official rank is also high, and there are many disciples, who can compete with Nantian. (5) Zou Yigui—the colors are bright and clean, the brush and ink are elegant, welcoming the wind and containing dew, graceful and lifelike, is the only famous master seen after Nantian. (6) Outline flower and dot leaf school—this school was originally created by Zhou Zhimian of the Ming Dynasty, between meticulous brushwork and freehand brushwork. The semi-meticulous and semi-freehand paintings of the Qing Dynasty include Sun Kehong, Zhang Ruoai, etc. (7) Freehand school—this school came from the ink freehand style of Lin Liang, Xu Wei, and Chen Chun of the Ming Dynasty. (8) The Eight Eccentrics of Yangzhou—such as Jin Nong, Luo Pin, Gao Fenghan, Li Shan, Huang Shen, Zheng Xie, etc., became commoners or petty officials, each pursuing his own strangeness and opening up new aspects. Although they are not all flower painters, they all have the same tendency. At that time, they were called eccentric because their styles were different from the orthodox school of the Four Wangs. Now, looking at his paintings, he no longer feels strange. (9) Hua Yan—with his unrestrained and unrestrained brushwork and clear and elegant atmosphere, he became the master of flower and bird painting in the late Qing Dynasty. However, his brush strength is inevitably too soft, and those who learn from him tend to be thin and soft. Zhao Ziyi, Wu Ting, etc. used heavy brushwork to save it. At the extreme, it turned into Wu Junqing's roughness, and the Qing Dynasty was already over.</p>
<p>(6) The Rise of Different Forces</p>
<p>(A) Landscape painters—in the heyday of the Qing Dynasty, all the masters were skilled in copying and imitating, and the scholars followed suit, and did not dare to be different. Although there were one or two outstanding talents who sketched from real scenery, they were not valued by the world. Therefore, there are many stones and Zhang, but the history of painting contains quite a few people. For example, Fang Xianting's footprints almost covered the world, and what he saw was nothing but a powder book. Huang Ding read all the famous mountains in the world, and his method was to truly write about Huangshan. Hong Ran wrote about Tiantai Yandang, and Dai Benxiao painted Huashan. Huang Wenjian, a filial son, traveled thousands of miles to find his relatives, experienced the wildness, and captured all the strange scenery and strange peaks in his pen, which was especially outstanding. (B) Finger painting—Gao Qipei used his fingers instead of brushes to paint, and his flowers and figures were painted at will, creating a unique style in the painting world, and there were many scholars. (C) Western painting—the eastward spread of Western painting began in the Ming Dynasty, but the arrival of Western painters Lang Shining and Ai Qicha in the East had a great influence. They used meticulous and realistic Western methods to create eclectic Chinese paintings. For a time, there were many scholars, such as Jiao Bingzhen, Leng Mei, Tang Dai, Chen Mei, Luo Fumin, Ding Yuantai, Zhang Shu, etc., who were all known for their Western methods. Although this style of painting was popular for a while, it soon declined. It was not until the late Qing Dynasty and the early Republic of China that Western painting began to rise again, but it was completely different from the painting of Lang Shining's era.</p>
<p>(7) Conclusion</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Art Museum Preparatory Office held an exhibition of Qing Dynasty paintings, coinciding with the opening of this Art Festival, and this short article is written to mark the celebration. (February 29, 1948)</p>

<p>— Lu Danlin</p>
<p>Last autumn, the Shanghai Municipal Art Museum Preparatory Office held an "Exhibition of Paintings by Deceased Masters of the Past Century." Many visitors felt that it was a very meaningful art exhibition in recent years. After the closing, the colleagues immediately continued to prepare the Qing Dynasty Painting Exhibition. These two painting exhibitions are epoch-making, especially the Qing Dynasty Painting Exhibition. Its space and time are twice as large as the "Centennial Painting Exhibition." The period is from the early Qing Dynasty to Daoguang, and the authors are not limited to whether they resided in Shanghai, so its scope is relatively broad, and undoubtedly, its works are richer than before.</p>
<p>In Qing Dynasty painting, in addition to a part of the late period that has been displayed in the "Centennial Painting Exhibition" and will not be repeated, the schools worth mentioning include the Eight Masters of Jinling: Gong Xian, Fan Qi, Gao Cen, Zou Zhe, Wu Hong, Ye Xin, Hu Zao, and Xie Sun; and the Four Masters of Haiyang: Zha Shibiao, Sun Yi, Wang Zhirui, and Hong Ren. The Nine Friends in Painting include Dong Qichang, Wang Shimin, Wang Jian, Li Liufang, Yang Wenzhao, Cheng Jiasui, Zhang Xuezeng, Bian Wenyu, and Shao Mi. Among the Nine Friends in Painting, there are also the Six Masters of Landscape, namely Wang Shimin, Wang Jian, Wang Hui, Wang Yuanqi, Wu Li, and Yun Shouping. Wang Yuanqi also established the Lou Dong School, and Wang Hui the Yushan School. The two schools stand side by side, each with its own characteristics. The landscape painters after Qianlong and Jiaqing to the present are mostly within the scope of these two schools, and their power can be said to be broad and strong. The Ten Philosophers of Painting include Dong Bangda, Zhang Zhao, Li Shizhuo, Wang Yunxi, Gao Xiang, Gao Fenghan, Li Shizhong, Wang Yange, Zhang Shiying, and Chen Jiale. The Eight Eccentrics of Yangzhou include Jin Nong, Luo Pin, Zheng Xie, Li Shan, Wang Shishen, Li Fangying, and Gao Xiang. (There are also those who add or subtract Min Zhen, Gao Fenghan, and others.) Others include the Su Song School, the Hua Shi School, the Yunjian School, the Xin'an School, the Jiangxi School, etc., each with its own territory. There are also those who specialize in one art, such as those who disdain copying and specializing in green and blue, imitating Jing Hao and Guan Tong, copying Song, Yuan, and Ming Dynasty Daoist and Buddhist figures, figure portraits, flower, bird, grass, insect, and animal paintings, etc., each searching for its best during this period. Except for the Ren Yi and Wu Junqing schools of the late Qing Dynasty and the Lingnan School, the various schools of Qing Dynasty painting are the most brilliant, connecting the works of the Centennial Painting Exhibition, which can be appreciated and studied as an epoch-making event. From this, it is also possible to trace the remaining charm of the Yuan and Ming paintings, the origin of the Shanghai School painting, and the origins and evolution of various schools and families. These can all be appreciated and appreciated in this painting exhibition. And in some works, we can see the Qing government's advocacy of civil governance, promotion of painting, and use of titles such as Inner Court Attendants and Inner Court Waiters to win over painters. And some painters also flattered, and in the pursuit of fame and fortune, they did not hesitate to lower their ambitions and humiliate themselves, wielding their brushes and ink to win "imperial appreciation." Those recorded in the Shiqu Baoji are mostly not painting experts, but literati and officials who are fond of fame and fortune. Therefore, by appreciating historical art, it is also possible to explore the thoughts and character of people in a certain era and a certain class.</p>

<p>— Li Ximou</p>
<p>Looking back to ancient times, the purpose of painting was primarily practical, with aesthetics being secondary. During the Xia, Shang, Zhou dynasties, and the Qin and Han dynasties, painting was often used to decorate objects and to promote education. In the late Han and the Six Dynasties periods, Chinese painting was influenced by Indian Buddhist paintings, resulting in brilliant religious paintings. Descending to the prosperous Tang dynasty, with the rise of Lao-Zhuang philosophy, Buddhism, and poetry, painting shifted its focus to brushwork, ink, and the pursuit of spirit and rhythm, pioneering the style of literati painting. By the Five Dynasties, Song, and Yuan dynasties, artists strived for freehand expression, and masterpieces often depicted landscapes. By the Ming and Qing dynasties, imitation became prevalent, coexisting with literati painting.</p>
<p>During the Qing dynasty, due to the advocacy of painting, many talented artists within the country devoted themselves to calligraphy and painting, serving the court. At that time, prime ministers and attendants who were favored for their painting skills were not uncommon. Their influence was widespread, and the prosperity of painting rivaled that of previous dynasties. The most prominent schools of painting included the Xin'an School of Zhejiang, the Jiangxi School of Luo Shouzhi, the Suzhou School of Chi Mu, the Loudong School of Wang Yuanqi, and the Yushan School, which was derived from the Loudong School and dominated the latter half of the Qing dynasty. Other notable schools included the Huating School of Dong Qichang and the Songjiang School of Zhao Wenmin. Among these schools, those that emphasized reviving ancient styles produced paintings that were gentle and serene, while those that emphasized innovation created paintings that were fresh and unrestrained. In particular, the Ming dynasty loyalists, seeking alternative paths, expressed their resentment towards the country and family in their brushwork, creating a unique style in Qing dynasty painting, which had a significant impact on later generations.</p>
<p>Throughout history, the most valuable paintings were those collected in the imperial court. The Qing dynasty especially expanded its collection, as evidenced by the calligraphy and painting catalogs of the Department of Palace Affairs. At that time, countless officials and gentry families collected ancient paintings, but they were often hidden and kept as private possessions, preventing the public from studying these works of art, which were essential to the nation's culture, causing cultural stagnation. Now, with the advancement of science, distances between people have been shortened due to convenient transportation, and ancient artifacts can be easily distributed through improved printing technology. Various academic fields are flourishing, benefiting both individuals and society. Since the early Republic of China, with the promotion by the government and the support of local people, paintings have had the opportunity to be publicly exhibited, allowing enthusiasts to appreciate and study them, thus reviving the almost extinct art.</p>
<p>The Preparatory Office of the Shanghai Art Museum previously held a painting exhibition of the past century, which was well-received by the public. Now, tracing back to the source, they are holding a Qing dynasty painting exhibition, aiming to promote painting and art education, in order to rectify the decadent social customs and usher in a new era of culture. And since Shanghai is the gateway for international cultural exchange, showcasing Chinese art to international audiences has a significance that goes beyond merely promoting art!</p>

<p>— Lü Di</p>
<p>Braving the piercing wind and dense snow, I arrived at the home of the sculptor, brother Liu Kaiqu.</p>
<p>In a somewhat damp sitting room, furnished with a few old rattan chairs, hung a newly created bas-relief, more than two feet long. Light from the low window slanted across the artwork, bringing the shallow undulations to life. It depicted the spring sunlight, gently illuminating the fields; farmers, in groups, busy tilling the land, renewing the earth, and clothing it in a lush green garment.</p>
<p>Spring, as the artwork tells us, brings new hope to the farmers. They dedicate their entire minds, all their labor, and all their money, even resorting to borrowing, to cultivate, sow, and nurture. During the day, they keep a watchful eye; at night, they dream of a bountiful year, filled with food and clothing.</p>
<p>Hope, hope. These most virtuous Chinese farmers, who endure what others cannot endure, and suffer what others can no longer suffer, toil year after year, yet their fate grows more tragic day by day. They cannot till the land, they cannot live in their homes, their wives are separated from their children, and tens of thousands are on the brink of death.</p>
<p>The artist, with his refined skill and the heart of a farmer's son (Kaiqu was born into a farming family), depicts the labor of farmers, making it exceptionally intimate, authentic, and moving. Those plowing the fields, those planting rice, those three women with a child – simple, unadorned, earnest – reminded me of the farmers I saw and lived with during the ten years of upheaval and wandering in the rural areas of various provinces. I thought of the refugees I saw just now on the street, gaunt and emaciated in the cold wind and heavy snow, their bodies barely covered, begging for food. Aren't they precisely the people celebrated in this bas-relief? Thinking of this, my heart felt truly heavy.</p>
<p>Brother Kaiqu told me that he plans to create four such bas-reliefs, depicting his childhood experiences in the countryside, tending to mountains, cutting grass, feeding cattle and herding sheep, and the year-round labor of the farmers he witnessed. This is a subject matter that Chinese art, especially sculptural art, has traditionally avoided, but it is precisely where Chinese art can find new development. I agreed with his opinion. I feel that artists can no longer be concerned solely with romantic scenery or entertaining high officials and wealthy people. For the sake of their art, for the sake of the nation and the people, they should face reality and earnestly speak for the majority of people, especially for the farmers.</p>

<h3 id="e207">Earthworms <a href="#e207" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c207" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">207</a></h3>
<p>— Boyong</p>
<p>After a spring rain, with the sun shining, earthworms can often be seen on the damp ground. Mencius once used this tiny creature to compare to Chen Zhongzi, a virtuous man of Qi, but he did not approve, believing that he was too concerned with personal purity and had nothing to do with saving the world. Therefore, he said, "If one were to follow the principles of Zhongzi, then one would have to be like an earthworm. For the earthworm, it eats withered matter above and drinks from the Yellow Springs below." This sounds good on the surface. Earthworms only deal with soil and the Yellow Springs and do not contend with other things. However, to consider this as self-preservation is a great mistake. Everyone knows that earthworms "eating withered matter above" can improve the soil and increase fertilizer, which is of great benefit to farmers. The earthworm itself may not be aware of this, but this precisely embodies the virtue of achieving merit without claiming credit, acting silently like the sun and moon, which we cannot help but admire and praise.</p>
<p>It is said that Darwin studied this creature from a young age, spending most of his life on it. In 1881, he published his great work, "The Formation of Vegetable Mould Through the Action of Worms," proving that most of the soil on earth has been transformed by earthworms. The original text states: "When we see a large expanse of flat land covered with turf, we should remember that this smooth surface is largely due to earthworms leveling out the unevenness. It is strange to think that the entire surface of this flat land has passed through the bodies of earthworms, and will pass through again every few years. Before humans invented the plow, earthworms had already been plowing the fields! Is there any other small animal in the world that plays such an important role in the history of the earth?"</p>
<p>We really cannot imagine that a dirty little worm could have such great merit. The scientist Thomson calculated that every square mile of land has more than 62,200 tons of soil brought to the surface each year. In 27 years, all the soil to a depth of two feet will be turned over to the surface. Darwin calculated that on average, there are 53,000 earthworms per acre of cultivated land in England, and there may be 500,000 on barren land. These 53,000 earthworms per acre can completely pass ten tons of soil through their digestive systems and move it to the surface in one year. In fifteen years, this soil can accumulate to three inches, and in sixty years, it can accumulate to one foot thick. This is even more astonishing.</p>
<p>Therefore, we also think of all the silent majority, who do their duty and work without praise or reward. What in the world is not made by these people's hands and feet? The pyramids of the Egyptian kings, the Great Wall and canals of China, and even the Dnieper Hydroelectric Station in the Soviet Union. Aren't the hundred-story skyscrapers of the United States and the miles-long Golden Gate Bridge the same? We see that in cruel wars, some people complain, saying things like, "Do not talk about the rewards of nobility; one general's success is built on the bones of ten thousand soldiers." As a result, Paris has a tomb of the unknown soldier, and Washington also erected the same monument. However, I have never heard of anyone holding a memorial service for those who sacrificed themselves for the cause of workers and peasants. War is extraordinary, bestial, and destructive. Frankly speaking, it is the most foolish act of humanity. Yet, some people praise it and commend it. Why is it that those who work hard for the happiness and benefit of all mankind are so neglected? I cannot help but feel pessimistic and doubtful about human reason again.</p>
<p>Confucius is perhaps greater than Mencius. Just looking at words like "A scholar who is devoted to the Way but ashamed of poor clothes and poor food is not worth discussing" shows that he is more broad-minded and practical than Mencius. Also, "Eating coarse rice and vegetables, drinking water, and using one's arm as a pillow – joy is also in it" is even more proactive. Although he would visit Jie Ni, whom Zilu opposed, he did not excessively blame Heaven or Earth when he was hungry in Chen and Cai. Moreover, his replies to the madmen Jie Yu and Chu Kuang also had the meaning of accepting one's fate and sacrificing oneself, that is, "If I am not a follower of these people, then who am I?" It seems that earthworms are destined to eat dung and soil. It is not necessarily as sweet as delicacies, but they swallow grass roots and rotten leaves. Perhaps "knowing that it cannot be done, yet doing it" is just like this. Only by knowing that it cannot be done, yet doing it, can one ultimately "achieve something." Human progress is not in speculation or shortcuts, but in step-by-step, bit-by-bit accumulation. Even a bloody revolution is just a little bit of acceleration, making it faster. All speculation and luck are like sediment and mineral deposits in a water pipe, which must be cleared. This is precisely the purpose of revolution. Confucius greatly praised Yan Hui's living in a humble alley and drinking from a gourd because although he ate fallen leaves and rotten soil, he truly restrained himself and restored the rites, becoming a model for others, showing his greatness in the ordinary, and not covering up his incompetence with external greatness, such as "mountains carved with birds and beams painted with seaweed."</p>
<p>However, the world teaches by making "great men the idols of young children, ordering them to worship and imitate them," which is truly incomprehensible. Great men are like tigers and leopards among beasts, or falcons among birds, or perhaps even like gorillas and parrots. Suppose all the beasts were tigers and leopards, and there were no dogs to guard the night or cats to catch mice; if all the birds were falcons and there were no murmuring swallows, catching insects, formations of flying geese, or messengers to deliver letters, what kind of world would it be? In chaotic times, there are especially many great men. Cao Cao claimed to be great, and Lü Bu and Yuan Shao were not willing to fall behind. Liu Bei and Sun Quan were even more ferocious. Thus, there was the battle of Puyang, the second battle of Xiapi, and the third battle of Chibi. Eight hundred and thirty thousand soldiers turned into monkeys and cranes, sand and insects. Who bestowed this? As long as someone wants to be a hero, then "order" and "peace" can never be attained. Everyone must be an ordinary worker who eats withered matter above and drinks from the Yellow Springs below, so that we can strive for a little more happiness. Not only that, but in my impression, being a hero and firing a loud cannon is not difficult. As long as one chooses things that ordinary people are unwilling to do or do not want others to do, and does them in a big way, wouldn't that be a hero? The ancients said, "If there were no heroes, then villains would become famous." This saying should be looked at in reverse. The ordinary and honest work and people who "work when the sun rises, rest when the sun sets, dig wells to drink, and till fields to eat" seems easy, but in reality, it is so difficult! Shanghai is crowded with five million people, but the countryside has nothing. Isn't it because everyone wants to come to the city to be a hero and sees farming and digging wells as a long journey? I dare to assert that if the Chinese people and even the people of the world do not have an awakening in their hearts, replacing the special with the ordinary, replacing the great with the universal, replacing the noisy with the silent, like tens of thousands of earthworms, turning out tens of thousands of tons of dung and soil in a year, giving plants a force to grow, so that the masses can all benefit from it, this world will never have peace and true progress.</p>

<p>— Nian Chuan</p>
<p>Why do so many people despise black? Is it because it represents a shameless soul? Is it because it symbolizes terrible encounters? But they forget the special quality of black. In a large dyeing vat, so many colors change, but black, it always preserves this color, even though it is unsightly. Let's think again: Crows may be considered unlucky birds because of their black color, but their filial piety is enough to show their greatness. Therefore, when we dislike something or something, don't just look at its surface; we should examine its inner characteristics. Black is an example.</p>
<h3 id="e209">Morning at South Lake <a href="#e209" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c209" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">209</a></h3>
<p>— Qifeng</p>
<p>While the morning mist was still thick and the dew was still wet, we, filled with youthful joy, quietly stepped into the boat cabin. The boat tilted to one side, and in slight surprise, we couldn't help but smile at each other. We only felt that the boat was gliding through the mirror-like lake surface with the sound of oars, leisurely moving forward.</p>
<p>The reed mat roof had been removed. A clear, refreshing fragrance carried by the morning breeze gently brushed across the lake. In the distance, we could only see a lush green expanse, veiled in a hazy white mist, indistinguishable as fields or houses. A crescent-shaped black shadow floated on the water's surface. As it approached, it turned out to be a bridge, low and narrow. A sturdy farmer stood on the bridgehead, a pipe in his mouth, looking at us in surprise, as if saying, "Such early travelers!"</p>
<p>The sound of the oars resonated rhythmically, monotonous yet a pleasant addition in this serene and beautiful morning. The boatwoman, her eyes still drowsy, perhaps did not sleep well last night, but her face was wreathed in smiles. Her dark face, strong arms, and a clean blue cloth shirt covered her healthy body. No wonder the boatwomen of South Lake have been famous in the Jiangnan region since ancient times! Their natural beauty is truly unique! She seemed to notice our gazes, turned her head slightly, and said shyly in her local accent, "We've arrived at the Misty Rain Tower!"</p>
<p>Before us, we could only see red walls and green trees blurred together in the mist over the water. A few towering, long branches and upturned roof corners vaguely appeared in the vast white mist. We remained silent, filled with a feeling of endless contemplation, allowing ourselves to be immersed in this gentle beauty.</p>
<p>We gently glided past the Misty Rain Tower, pondering in our hearts: Today there is no rain, so let the mist count as rain! Casually looking back again, the red walls and black tiles, pavilions and terraces, were all hidden in the green shade. In this scene, I almost felt like I was in a painting.</p>
<p>A rustling sound came from under the boat, as the short reeds that had been cut grazed the bottom. In the dense aquatic grass on the side of the bank, a flock of ducks leisurely swam by, waddling their plump bodies, stretching their necks, and piercing the silence with their loud calls.</p>
<p>Turning in a circle, the morning mist had unknowingly thinned and dispersed. Raising our heads, we could only see a clear sky and ten thousand miles of light, with a few wisps of floating clouds drifting by. The sunlight shone all over the earth, and we only felt the glittering golden light dazzle our eyes.</p>
<p>Lightly jumping onto the shore steps, we took a few steps, still frequently turning our heads to gaze. This quiet South Lake! It is so tranquil and unadorned, truly making me reluctant to leave.</p>

<p>— Chen Shenyan</p>
<p>Chapter 13: Attempting to Remedy (107)</p>
<p>Yunqing lifted her eyelids and glanced at Zhu Qi, saying, "What does it matter if I'm thin or not?" Zhu Qi said, "Your complexion is not good. Are you sick?" Yunqing said, "Sick or dead, it's nothing to do with you!" Zhu Qi stood up, placing both hands on the table, and said, "Yun, how is it nothing to do with me? Not a day goes by that I don't think of you!" Yunqing coldly smiled and said, "Think of me? You haven't shown your face for half a month! Please say these words to someone else!" Zhu Qi said, "Who should I say them to?" Yunqing said, "Think for yourself who you should say them to." Zhu Qi still leered and said, "I'm saying them to you." Yunqing shook her head and said, "I'm not worthy!" Zhu Qi said, "There's no one else! Could it be Fengsheng? I've already divorced her!" Yunqing shook her head. Her tears were already flowing down, drop by drop. She put down the yarn and quickly took out her small handkerchief, dabbing it on the corners of her eyes, and said, "Fengsheng, I'm the one who harmed her. If she hadn't listened to me, she wouldn't have divorced you. I never thought you were this kind of person. Every time I think about it, my heart aches. If you really have a conscience, you should go back and kneel before her, beg her forgiveness, and cancel the divorce papers." Zhu Qi feigned surprise and said, "What are you talking about? I don't understand." Yunqing said, "Don't pretend to be confused. Say something clear. We both know what's in each other's hearts." Zhu Qi said, "The reason I divorced Fengsheng was for you." Yunqing tilted her head back, her face full of anger, and said, "For me?" As she said this, she shook her head and then lowered it again. Zhu Qi, at this point, still did not understand the situation and said, "Don't misunderstand. If it wasn't for you, why would I divorce Fengsheng?" Yunqing shook her head and said "I haven't misunderstood, I understand very well, you shouldn't see others as muddleheaded and yourself as clever, this time you have been clever for your own sake!" Zhu Qi had been so coldly ridiculed that his face could not help but flush red. He sat down again and said, "Yun, I see that your spirit must have been stimulated again, right?" Yunqing said, "I have been stimulated for more than a day, and I am like a mute eating bitter herbs, I have no place to complain, I hope that you will correct your conscience, and do good deeds in the future, and stop deceiving women. Fengsheng is pitiful, you should hurry back, I can understand everything, as for my intention, you know it, I would rather be in debt to others than have others in debt to me, I will not change until I die. Now I am determined to serve my mother, and once my old mother passes away, I will find a charitable organization to serve society, and end my life there. You don't have to come anymore, there is nothing to say even if you come!" Zhu Qi said, "Why is this so?" Yunqing shed tears and said sadly, "What can I say, I can't bear to say even if I can say it. If you must know, you can ask Uncle Xiao Bai."</p>
<h3 id="e211">The Mystery of the Sword Immortal <a href="#e211" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c211" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">211</a></h3>
<p>— Zhaolong</p>
<p>Having read the article "Two Stories of the Old Capital" in the "Free Talk" section of the 20th of this month, I have not heard of the story of Mr. Chu and dare not comment. As for the story of Wang, the Sword Immortal, I have seen the person and would like to tell it to the readers. Before August 13th, I always resided in Beiping. In the years 1925 and 1926, I heard of Wang, the Sword Immortal, and the legends of running races in the Western Hills. I wanted to meet him very much, but there was no opportunity. Until the years 1932 or 1933 (I don't remember clearly), led by Wang, the Sword Immortal's disciple, I went to meet him. He lived in the last large courtyard of a temple in the western part of Beiping, which was a very quiet place. When we were about to knock on the door, his disciple said, "Don't knock hard, if you knock hard he will get angry, use your finger and gently tap." As expected, after a tap, he came to open the door and welcome us inside. He was about five feet ten inches tall, wearing a blue cloth gown, with a thin face and bright eyes. At first glance, I knew he was a person with a foundation in Chinese martial arts. There was a Buddhist altar in the house, and the table was full of hundreds of sea shells of various sizes. After sitting down, he did not offer tea, but took out a wine glass and poured white liquor to offer to the guests. In conversation, I felt that he did not have much literary cultivation and no profound knowledge. I wanted to spend more time with him, so I talked about this and that for more than an hour. Later, I said I would treat him to dinner, he said okay, so we knocked on the door and went out together. I saw that he looked like he was in his fifties, but he walked with remarkable speed (the word "flew" is just used to express his quickness, not flying like a sword immortal in novels). When we arrived at the restaurant, when offering him the seat, I deliberately used my hand to push his waist to make him sit in the upper place, to test his strength. I felt that his body was very hard and difficult to push, but it was generally possessed by those who were proficient in martial arts, not surprising. After the meal, we parted ways, regretting this visit, it is true that hearing about it is not as good as seeing it, Mr. Wang is just someone deeply proficient in martial arts. As for coming to open the door after tapping his finger, I later carefully observed that there was still a small door in his courtyard, leading to a corridor, directly to the temple door, or someone might have entered the door in advance to report, and then he would wait for a while before coming to open the door, also not knowing. In short, the saying of the Sword Immortal is unbelievable, and Mr. Wang is absolutely not a Sword Immortal. (Paid)</p>

<p>Dedicated to You Mojun</p>
<p>A heart filled with noble talent is hidden, with generous tragic songs that can also be sorrowful. The literary works of a generation, the pen of Jiang Ling, with winds and rains from all directions, like the Terrace of Yan Zhao. The heart is wounded by the lifelessness of the courtiers, tears fall for the homeland, leaving behind ashes of calamity. Form a poetic realm with a few confidants, throwing out excellent lines, bright as jade.</p>
<p>Spring Wind</p>
<p>The sun and moon throw the shuttle, busy day and night, the spring wind is like scissors cutting out the spring light. Waves shake the mirror-like surface, the writing is gorgeous, the grass greens the waist of the skirt, the embroidery is fragrant. The Narcissus enjoys the hospitality of Tao Qian, the mountain ghost wanders and sings like Qu Yuan, greedily admire the peach and apricot blossoms bustling on the branches, and the bees and butterflies compete to cross the wall.</p>

<p>Chickens, dogs, mulberry trees, and hemp are all that is needed for immortality. Peach Blossom Spring is not necessarily a fiction. It is only because there are few refined guests in the mundane world that they do not believe that there is a paradise on earth.</p>
<p>A great man, like the governor, is equally busy, but it is difficult to come to a land of peace and happiness after all. Good water and good mountains are everywhere, only a fisherman seeks them out.</p>
<p>When is there ever no struggle in the world? One should avoid Qin and go to this place. It is a pity that fame and profit have entangled people for a long time; who would be willing to spend a lifetime in an empty mountain!</p>
<p>The calamity of war and weapons fills the eyes, and the white bones of the Central Plains fly as ashes again. Where is a good place to settle down in the human world? One should come to the Peach Blossom Spring in the painting.</p>

<p>— Mao Yi</p>
<p>Thomas Finegan is the American man with the most marriages. He often dresses as a groom and holds wedding ceremonies with strange women in the courthouse of Wyandotte County, Kansas. Does Finegan often suffer marital discord? No. Is he a philanderer? That's not right either. Finegan is a lawyer in the county who represents grooms and brides who are overseas in proxy wedding ceremonies.</p>
<p>Not long before Japan surrendered, Finegan's business was booming, with marriages happening almost every two weeks. He thought that once the war ended, this marriage career would calm down. Who knew that the opposite would happen? His proxy weddings became even busier, and he even had to pull his wife in as an assistant.</p>
<p>Mrs. Finegan's role is to be the bride. Some American veterans, because their brides were still overseas and wanting to have a marriage ceremony first, came to consult lawyer Finegan. Because Mr. Finegan is male, it was inconvenient for him to represent the bride, so he brought his wife out. Local people often jokingly ask Mrs. Finegan when they meet her, "How many husbands do you have now?"</p>
<p>Finegan's proxy wedding business began in 1943. That year, a person came to the prosecutor's office in Washington, D.C. He had a niece living in the country who longed to marry someone serving overseas but didn't know how to do it legally. After reviewing the laws of various states, the prosecutor found that only Kansas had a proxy marriage law. So, he wrote a letter to the Wyandotte County Bar Association, whose president at the time was Finegan. He accepted the request to represent the marriage and started this new business.</p>
<p>Now, Finegan has married dozens of brides. Before each wedding, he always calls in his secretary to memorize the name and address of the bride for this particular ceremony. Sometimes, after the proxy wedding ceremony is over, the officiating judge pulls him aside and quietly asks, "Which number is this bride—number forty-five or forty-six?"</p>
<p>Proxy weddings don't always take place in a leisurely manner. There was a country woman who had a relationship with her lover before marriage. Later, the man was transferred abroad, but the woman became pregnant. Both parties wanted to complete the marriage ceremony before the baby was born. Time was very pressing. The woman was in a hospital in Missouri waiting to give birth. She really had no other choice but to seek help from Finegan. He rushed to the hospital to pick her up and accompanied her to Wyandotte County. During the ceremony, Finegan and the heavily pregnant bride were extremely nervous, fearing that the fetus would not be able to hold on and would come out to "attend the ceremony" when the wedding march began to play. Fortunately, this joke did not happen. The bride gave birth the next day after returning safely to the hospital. It was a girl—a girl with "legal" parents.</p>
<h3 id="e215">Luoyang in Central China <a href="#e215" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c215" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">215</a></h3>
<p>—</p>
<p>Recently viewed the exquisite map of Luoyang on the front page of the Shen Bao on the 17th, which can be regarded as a symbol of the most abundant page of Chinese territory and history. The old saying "the center of the world," the saying "county flowers like brocade," the saying "ancient capital of emperors," there are enough adjectives.</p>
<p>Henan Province is known as "Central China," but Kaifeng, although it is the provincial capital in modern times and the capital of the Five Dynasties and Northern Song Dynasty, cannot represent the word "Central China." Luoyang is the "center of the world," formerly the first county of "Henan Prefecture." Henan Prefecture is the outer prefecture of "Henan Province," so it is said, "Henan is not in Henan Province." During the Three Kingdoms period, Cao Wei held the emperor to command the vassals, occupying the Zhang and Luo areas, claiming to be "China" to oppose Shu and Wu, and also called "Central Plains." Therefore, the "center" character of China was first prosperous in Henan. As for whether Central China is the "center of the world," the "world" in ancient times refers to the territory of the country, and it is more based on the southeast being the sea and the northwest being the mountains as the standard. Roughly measure it, find a place that is close to the sea in the east and far from the desert in the west, which is relatively moderate, and this Central China is close to it.</p>
<p>"Luoyang brocade has myriad flowers," "Since ancient times, the valley has been a land of spirits," the prosperous and beautiful historical sites, and the sad stories of Shi Chong and Green Pearl, are permanently passed down, and there are still relics of "Golden Valley Garden" today. Li Bai wrote in a poem: "I remember Dong Caoqiu in Luoyang in the past, who built a winery for me south of Tianjin Bridge." Luoyang's "Tianjin Bridge" is well-known because of the poet's high praise. So, a good name of Henan was transferred to Tianjin in Hebei, not called "Gu Shang," but called "Jin Qiao." "Gu Shang" is indeed the local scenery of Tianjin (seventy-two Gu), while "Jin Qiao" is borrowed from "Luoyang." Although there are many rivers in Tianjin, there are no famous bridges or ancient sites. As for "Wanguo Bridge" and "Jingang Bridge," although the architecture is extremely magnificent, they are "Western-style Jin Qiao."</p>
<p>The scenic spots of Beiman outside Luoyang City and Yique Longmen are seen in various travel notes. Yu Quyuan was impeached and dismissed from his post as Henan Xuezheng and returned to his hometown, regarding "having visited Yique and Longmen" as not in vain, which shows that it is a famous site. Beiman Mountain has been a burial place since ancient times. Countless celebrities have been sleeping there in the capitals of the past. There was an old man who comforted people in a poem: "Don't sigh about the white hair when you are old, it is also very difficult when the hair turns white. How many young and good sons. A gust of wind blows them up to Beiman Mountain." However, since the Northern Song Dynasty, Central China has not been the capital again, the status of the city has declined, and this "ghost capital" (Beiman) has gradually declined. The Western Hills of Beiping have become the rising Beiman in the north. Duan Qirui, a senior military and political figure from Anhui, died in Shanghai and was also buried in the Western Hills of Beiping. Zhang Shaozeng died in Tianjin and was also buried in the Western Hills. General Zhang Zongchang, a Shandong native, died in Jinan and was also buried in the Western Hills. Celebrities Liang Qichao and Luo Wengan, who were from Guangdong, were also buried in the Western Hills. There are also some Futian Cemetery and Wan'an Cemetery. All the retired officials of Pingjin and various circles in Hebei, once they die, mostly send their bones to the Western Hills. Therefore, the ground in the western suburbs outside Beiping City naturally formed a "modern Beiman."</p>
<p>During Wu Peifu's heyday, Luoyang was virtually the political center. Although it did not have the name of the capital, its momentum was above that of Beijing. At that time, after his successive victories in the wars against the Anhui and Feng armies, he was the Inspector of Zhili, Shandong, and Henan. He chose Luoyang as his residence because it was located at the strategic point of the Longhai Railway and not far from the intersection of the Pinghan Railway. Transportation in all directions was convenient, and it was the capital of emperors of past dynasties. Especially, it was the location of the forest and tomb of Guan Yu, whom he admired most. He thought he was controlling the situation in the center and that the overall situation of China was in his grasp. In the twelfth year of the Republic of China, when he was fifty years old, celebrities from the military and political circles and various provinces went to congratulate him. Kang Youwei sent a birthday couplet: "The eagle soars in Muye, only half of the fame and achievements of a hundred generations," "The tiger watches in Luoyang, the winds and rains of all directions will gather in Central China." Zhang Jian, the top scholar from Nantong, sent a birthday couplet: "The prestige of ten thousand miles is like thunder and reaches far"; "The longevity of a hundred years is like the sun in the middle of the sky." This shows the momentum of Luoyang at that time. While Li Yuanhong and Cao Kun were presidents in Beijing, the military and political circles remotely obeyed the command of Luoyang, and Lao Wu's limelight reached its peak. The following year (Jiazi), he failed in the war against Feng, and from then on, he fell into decline. The fiery situation in Luoyang also disappeared, but the importance of its position left an even deeper impression.</p>
<p>In September of the twentieth year of the Republic of China, the Japanese invaders launched the "September 18th Incident." In January of the following year, they created a large-scale invasion in Shanghai, threatening Nanjing from Songhu. For the sake of safety and resistance, the government designated Luoyang as the temporary capital, and a part of it had already moved there. At that time, if it were not for the mediation of various countries and the establishment of a peace agreement, then a full-scale resistance would have been forced to begin, and Luoyang would have been the Chongqing of the nearly eight-year war. Isn't its historical value important?</p>

<p>Answer to reader Hu Shujun:</p>
<p>1. According to this order, high school graduates are included.</p>
<p>2. Applications for deferred conscription, exemption from service, and prohibition of service will be announced by the Bureau in each district.</p>
<p>3. Conscription in this city is carried out in accordance with laws and regulations, and there is no regulation for conscripting those who are 25 years old.</p>
<p>Answer to reader Zheng Lunong:</p>
<p>1. It depends on the graduating school and the position of the service organization.</p>
<p>2. The conscription in this year is to remove those who have been approved for exemption from service, deferred conscription, and prohibition of service in the 36th year, and then number them and include them in the lottery, and conscript them according to the lottery number. As for the application period for this year, please wait for the order to handle it.</p>
<p>Answer to reader Liu Houmin:</p>
<p>1. If the degree of nearsightedness is below 0.2 and there is a considerable level of education, they should still be conscripted for service.</p>
<p>2. Yes.</p>
<p>3. "Round conscription and inspection" means that re-examination is possible when the number is drawn.</p>
<p>4. The application for review should be transferred to the Bao level for review.</p>
