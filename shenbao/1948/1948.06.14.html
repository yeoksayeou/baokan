<h3>監察院議事規則　今晨開首次會提出討論</h3>

<h3>改革幣制時機未熟　政府確已擬具數種計劃　實行銀本位制實不可能</h3>
<p>〔本報南京十三日電〕幣値逐日低落聲中，改革幣制問題現已成爲全國上下所矚目的重要問題之一，自董顯光談話承認政府已有改革幣制之計劃後，此說益囂塵上，甚至有謂已決實行銀本位者。記者連日巳與官方及專家等接談，所獲綜合結論：改革幣制計劃，政府確已擬具數種，惟將於何時實行，因目前客觀條件尙未具備，故特別審愼將事，等待適當時機。貝祖詒此次赴美，與接洽改革幣制貸款有關，並携有我國所擬訂之有關幣制改革之數種計劃，俾提供美方之參考，至將來改革幣制時採行之本位，各方主張未盡相同，惟傳說中之銀本位制實行之可能性甚少，因參加國際貨幣基金會議之國家，將來幣制必須與國際貨幣基金相聯繫，故最可能採行「國際管理金本位制度」。</p>
<h3>時機及條件　各方意見不一</h3>
<p>關於改革幣制之時機及條件，各專家及各方面之意見亦不一致。谷春帆氏根據德國改革幣制之經驗，主張不必等待通貨膨脹停止，收支平衡或工農業生產增加之後才改革幣制，因如等待具備此三種條件，則改革幣制將不知何日始能實行。谷氏並認爲實行銀本位困難甚多，主張實行金滙兌本位，分期改革，首先稅收應照指數計算，以本位幣爲主，法幣爲輔，至收支平衡時，即完全採本位制，將法幣取消。張潛華認爲一切亂源在於共黨，共匪不能消滅，改革幣制亦屬徒勞，惟如改革幣制，則應以豪門資本作爲準備金。劉不同氏主張改革幣制應採用金本位，但不能採取無限制兌換辦法，並須實現國內和平，摧毀旣得利益階級，使收支平衡，然後始能進行幣制改革。曹國卿。顧鶴皋（均金大敎授）均認爲現法幣已惡性膨脹，應馬上停止發行，以改革幣制或先限制發行數目，逐漸停止發行。吳斐丹敎授指出：現頗有改革幣制實行銀本位之趨勢，惟銀本位在世界上已成爲一落伍之本位制度，實不宜採用，渠主張應實行「新金滙兌本位」制度。更有人指出實一行銀本位必須爲產銀最多的國家，但現在墨西哥已放棄銀本位而實行金本位矣。簡貫三氏認爲一般人對改革幣制希望雖熱烈，但客觀條件並不存在。簡氏指出：單靠國外的黃金或白銀實不能解決中國財政問題，白銀只應作爲輔幣，不能作爲主幣。綜合各方意見，咸認改革幣制時機尙未成孰，而銀本位制亦非適宜可行之本位制度。</p>
<h3>總統頒令任命　各部政務次長</h3>
<p>李崇實爲監院秘書長</p>
<p>〔中央社南京十三日電〕總統十二日頒布命令如下；（一）特派李崇實爲監院秘書長。（二）任命彭昭賢爲內政部政次，劉師舜爲外部政次，秦德純，蕭毅肅，鄭介民爲國防部次長，徐柏園爲財政部政次，杭立武爲敎部政次，洪陸東爲司法行政部政次，譚伯羽爲交部政次，賀衷寒爲社會部政次，沈百先爲水利部政次，湯惠蓀爲地政部政次，金竇善爲衛生部政次，陳良爲糧食部政次，吳兆洪爲資委會副委員長，白雲梯，喜饒嘉錯爲蒙藏委員會副委員長，龐松舟爲主計部主計官兼副主計長。（三）嫩江省政府委員劉博昆，趙憲文呈請辭職，劉博昆，趙憲文均准免本職。</p>
<h3>司法考試兩院長人選　總統日內即提名　兩院副院長可能由民青兩黨推荐</h3>
<p>〔本報南京十三日電〕司法·考試兩院正·副院長，即將由總統向監院提名，外間對人選問題頗多推測，記者頃自可靠方面獲悉。蔣總統正愼重斟酌人選，可望於三二日內提出，其中除王寵惠已內定爲司法院長外，考試院長及兩副院長均尙未確定，外傳莫德墨或會琦將由總統提名爲考試院長並無其事，聞總統擬聘莫德惠爲總統府資政，俾得隨時諮詢其對國家大計之意見，兩院副院長則可能由民·靑兩黨分別推荐人選，各担任一院之副院長。又前考試院考試委員人數雖不多，但幾均爲南方人，故總統決於行將提名之考委人選中提出東北及北方籍奢數人。大法官人選，亦將據此原則提名，以免在地域上有所偏頗。</p>
<h3>翁文灝邀各首長　研討答立委質詢</h3>
<p>〔本報南京十三日電〕行政院長翁文灝在立院提出之施政方針，事先曾經政院所屬各部曾首長之詳予研討，始行提出於立院者。翁氏報吿後，立院之質詢已壓兩日，翁氏爲研究對立委之答覆及檢討或提方針內容，曾於十三日晨邀集各部會首長，在其官邸進行檢討，歷數小時始畢。</p>

<h3>張嘉璈談話</h3>
<p>否認親屬操縱市塲</p>
<p>〔中央社本市訊〕最近某立法委員曾指責前中央銀行總裁張嘉激氏在任期間，主持外滙任務，其親屬不免有利用機會操縱市塲之嫌。張氏十三日特發表談話如次：「嘉璈服務社會與政府三十餘年，立身處世，社會自有公論；最近報載某立委指責一節，查在本人任內義給外滙及調整滙率，均有一定制度，凡商人請購外滙，均經輸出入管理委員會依據審核原則，籌核手續至爲嚴密與公開，凡得到許可證之戶名，每月均一一公佈。自去年八月十七日以後，外滙採取機動性調整辦法，另行設置平準基金委員會，由國府指派委員五人，每晨由委員會同指定銀行代表商議決定，調整滙率，本人並不參加，且此項滙價，祗適用於得到許可證之外滙交易，不知親屬何非利用機會操縱市塲？所有輸出入管理委員會及平準基金委員會工作經過，聞已有報吿送院，凡明瞭實際情况者，當必能判斷其是否曲直」云。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕紐約十三日廣播：美參院撥款委員會十三日舉行秘書會議，討論削减援華基金問題。霍夫曼·美陸長羅雅爾·勃里奇士等均出席作證：主張恢復原來四億六千三百萬美元之數字。魏德邁將軍亦列席，據渠告該委會稱：「如欲阻止共產主義，則軍事與經濟援華，均屬需要。」霍夫曼亦謂：「為阻止中國局勢更趨惡化，美國援華，乃屬必要」</p>
<p>〔中央社華盛頓十二日電〕參院撥款委員會，將於十四日就眾院對援華計劃消减六千三百萬元一事及他外援資金，採取行動。</p>
<p>〔中央社華盛頓十二日合衆電〕魏德邁將軍及經濟合作局長官霍夫曼，要求國會對中國作「單獨」之大量軍事及經濟協助，彼等向參院撥款委員會主席勃里奇提出籲請，蓋參院撥款委員會正考慮削减援外款額之建議。中國駐美大使顧維鈞曾應邀往委員會會議室，但未向委員會發言。按外國大使之出席參院撥款委員會，實非常舉。顧氏吿記者謂，渠幷無在該委員會發表言論之意圖·記者詢問美政府當局所請求爲期十五個月之五億七千萬美元對華援助，是否將協助遏止中國之通貨膨脹，渠答謂：供給中國之任何物品，均將緩和通貨膨脹之壓力。勃里奇于舉行秘密會議之後謂，魏德邁及霍夫曼曾竭力陳述中國局勢危急，以及就制止共產主義而言，經清及軍事援華之必要，勃里奇並謂：霍夫曼曾向委員會保證，渠將遴選品格優良之辦事幹練人士，掌理對華援助，同時並竭力籲請恢復衆院建議削减之款項。勃里奇稱：目前重大問題，亟待解決，吾人必須保持吾人在中國之目標，使局勢不致更見嚴重。衆院已取消參院所劃定對華援助中國於軍事援助之若干款項，而規定所有對華援助應依據對希·土而實行之消滅共產主義計劃之相同辦法處理之。</p>

<h3>當心火警！</h3>
<p>時入夏令，氣候酷熱，疾病與火災，成爲都市社會兩在憂患。防止疾病之發生和傳染，必須要講求衛生；防止火災之發生和損害，必須要講求消防，特別是要一般市民，自動自覺當心火警。河南路衆發堆棧五日大火後，昨晨四川中路又發生火警。關於河南路火警，已查明市民無辜死傷五十九人，附近商店報館均被殃及，損失尤爲慘重。關於昨晨火警，死傷和損失，尚在調查中。同時市政府又在從行政上澈查衆發堆棧大火的原因；地檢處正從司法上偵查衆發堆棧的犯罪責任；港務機關正從管制上研究易燃物品貯蔽的安全問題。這些事後的追查，表明行政上法律上無人負責，以「澈查」「偵查」及「研究」而推諉下去，死傷者含冤難白，損失者無由補償。這一塲意外的損失，大概很難獲得昭雪和救濟的了。</p>
<p>去春武定路大火，及南潯路茂昌公司堆棧焚燒以後，本報先後以「當心火警」的緊急呼聲，喚起市政當局和一般市民的注意，希冀當局與市民，基於戒懼心理，自動自覺爲防火之準備，不幸一年以來，火災時有增加，全市居民的生命財產，同受火災的威脅與迫害，這是上海都市社會的不幸。據本市消防處發表的歷年火災統計，去年一月至十一月底火警次數，達一一二九次之多，此十一個月中之數字，超過已往任何一年的紀録。這原因的構成，約分下列諸點：（一）人口增加至五百萬，居住集中；（二）建築不良，電綫設備未檢查，一般居民責任觀念缺乏，不重視居住房屋的保全；（三）家庭烹飪使用易燃液體。最易引起火災，（四）堆棧偏在市區，化學用品及易燃用品充斥堆棧，（五）港口碼頭貨物起卸無管制，且未實施安全檢查；（六）消防設備的悲敗。這次河南路衆發堆棧的大火，據俞局長叔平說：係私運影片二十大桶所惹起，此種廢影片爲硝酸纖維原料製成，最易燃燒，如經日晒或受熱，即產生燃性而發生大量的氣體的嚴重爆炸。</p>
<p>從以上分析，可知上海市巳往數次大火災的發生，物的原因多半爲化學物危險物，地的原因多半爲堆棧，現在爲要防患未然，曲突徙薪，我們願重申「當心火警」的呼籲，希望市當局在行政措施上，針對已往各次大火災的原因，迅速的積極的從事火災之防止，同時喚起市民和商戶，人人警惕，人人負責，化災害爲禎祥，去禍患於無形。至於防止火災的方法，技術方面有待市政和消防專家的研討，我們僅從原則上提出以下數端：</p>
<p>第一，上海市中區和住宅區的堆棧，應完全遷出。凡堆棧積存物資，均應受安全檢查。這次衆發堆棧積存危險物，違反「上海市運輸危險物品管理規則」，乃警察機關公用機關的失檢；去年招商局碼頭化學物爆發，乃港務機關的失職。現在上海市管制堆棧，及運輸的機關林立，市行政方面有公用局警察局，財務行政方面有江海關金融管理局，軍務方面有聯勤司令部港口司令部，商人方面有碼頭倉庫聯絡局倉庫同業公會，行政系統支離，管理辦法難周，這是必然的道理。今後應謀管理的一元化，幷逐漸遷移公私倉庫離開市區，以策安全。</p>
<p>第二，上海市經八年戰爭以來，公私建築之電料器材及裝置，大部己告陳舊，一遇潮濕即發生走電現象，故應速作電綫檢查，和公司行號家庭電器設備之安全檢查。</p>
<p>第三，家庭使用易燃液體應受限制。上海中小家庭多使用液體燃料，有的是烹飪致火，有的是儲藏引火，尤其烹飪使用火油，較汽油容易成災，市當局應作合理的限制和取締。事實上，為了廣大市民的生命財產計，是需要限制取締易燃液體的。</p>
<p>第四，上海市人口密集，且多非生產部門所需，爲社會經濟政策着眼，一方面應講求人口之疏散，一方面需要限制人口的遷入，以避免都市人口的集中。目前最重要的，如取締擱樓，制止不利於消防之各種建築，都是很必要的措施。</p>
<p>以上各端，僅就行政方面而言；至於市民方面，要希望人人樹立責任觀念，養成自動自覺的自治精神，以謹愼的心理，戒懼的生活，時時在行爲上，從事防止火災，則火災自可防止於未燃。</p>
<h3>遼西走廊態勢</h3>
<p>— 本報特派員　韓清濤</p>
<p>〔本報錦州十日航訊〕以錦州爲中心的遼西局面，在今天雖無多大開展可言，但它正發揮着穩固兩港一綫以及担負陸海空打成一片的雄偉任務，來反擊共匪「箍點」和「斷綫」的手段。所謂兩港是；葫蘆島和泰皇島兩個港口，一綫，就是聯繫關內外交通的北寗路，此外錦州上空不斷的嚮蔳馬達，那正是溝通瀋陽和關內外海面陸上的空中運輸。</p>
<p>空中運輸　雖然力量不够龐大，但，海上和鐵路運到錦州的麵粉，彈藥，被服，都一飛機一飛機的飛去了瀋陽，瀋陽的客人，猪鬃，特殊綱等出口貨物，也運到了錦州，得到了出口，錦瀋問空中五十分鐘的航程，加上畫長的夏天，每架飛機都可來往四次以上，問題就在怎樣能够發揮它的最大效能了。</p>
<p>接着我們看遼西匪軍和國軍的態勢，這個區域主要的是北起阜新南至綏中的地帶，匪擺上了一個第九縱隊，隔大凌河和國軍對峙，在軍事地圖上把這裏畫了一個大圈圈，表示這股匪盤踞和控制的地區相當大，匪司令部在北鎭，廿五師在大虎山以南，廿六師駐溝帮子，廿七師在北鎭和溝帮子間公路要點的閭陽驛，這個大圈圈，北起黑山南至大凌河東岸，切斷窒息了錦瀋間的脈搏和血液的流通。</p>
<p>義縣是遼西走廊北端的觸角，鐵道綫被破壞不通車了，匪在鐵道以西和以東地區，在軍川地岡上，鐵道西畫了七八個小圈圈，那是匪第廿一軍分區的一，二，三，六等地方匪股四個團，以及「九十二部隊」和「錦義支隊」等，另外還有一個自稱「第三師」的三千多股匪。鐵道東有一個第四團，幷有二百多的騎匪，來往竄擾。</p>
<p>義縣原爲兩條鐵路支出和會合點，一條從它那往西去的是錦州到承德或古北口的錦古路，一條從它那裏往東北去的是義縣到新立屯的新義路，義縣爲國軍據點，匪第廿一軍分區則在北票一帶。</p>
<p>錦州以西虹螺峴和筆架山一帶，畫有兩個小圈圈，在虹螺峴地方是匪「十八軍分區第一團」，筆架山是「遼西大隊」，再西又有兩個小圈圈，一個是缸窰嶺，匪十八軍分區指揮所設在那裏，另一個圈是山神廟子和玻璃瓦地方，匪有一個第二團。</p>
<p>錦西以西，有兩個小圈圈，那是楊家杖子，藏有豐富的鉏磯，匪「錦西支隊」在那盤踞，從那到錦西的鐵路已經不通，原先錦西水泥廠是從這運石頭的，再往西南看，興城以西「碱廠」地方，有匪「興城支隊」盤踞着，綏中以西「寬邦」地方，是匪「綏中支隊」。</p>
<p>從錦州到山海關問鐵道以西地方，山地連綿，對匪有利，國軍每個據點幾乎都有一個匪地方支隊遙遙相對，鐵道東側，緊靠海濱，頗稱平靜。</p>
<p>錦四和興城間，鐵道以西比較遠的地方，匪獨八師，擁有廿二·廿三·廿四三個團，在建昌縣屬的地區裏，這裏還有有一個「蒙騎支隊」，建昌以東的藥王廟，是匪「十八軍分區專署」和匪「建東縣府」所在地，並駐有一個「建東支隊」，它的西邊大西山裏，有匪小型兵工廠一所，男工千八百人，女工二百人，日出手榴彈千餘，還在造子彈。</p>
<p>統觀遼西阜新和綏中間的匪軍，在大凌河以東的第九縱隊和建昌以東的獨八師，都是匪的正規的野戰軍，另有些騎匪也比較的標悍，其餘統有一千人的「團」，和五六百人的「支隊」，是地方隊伍，有人呌做土八路，正規和地方的匪計算在一起，不過三四萬人，其中的地方隊伍，缺乏武器·彈藥·無戰鬥經騐，不過組織和政治訓練是比較堅强的。</p>
<p>東從義縣起，西到秦皇島止，國軍共有四個大軍，此外還有暫編師，交通警察，以及一些新訓練的隊伍，再加地方上的團隊，兵力稱得雄厚二字。</p>
<p>匪如以五個以上的縱隊打遼西走廊，瀋陽的國軍必出擊，按照匪「打不過不打」的作戰原則，是不敢輕易來攻堅，不過在交通上的破壞，國軍是防不勝防，短期切斷交通是可能的，尤以雨季來了，破壞後的搭橋和不能再從河底通車，都增加了路方的困難。</p>
<p>政治上的軍民合作問題，亟待改善，好多人民對於軍隊表示不滿，原因是有些軍隊和老百姓要糧，要樹，要肉，要鷄，要錢，記者聽到好多人說：「每逢八路來一次擾亂，老百姓就遭殃了，好像老百姓把匪引來似的，打，，逼迫，弄得人民左旣不是，右也不成，稍微有點行動能力的，都避免他地，流亡四方，沒辦法的只好忍耐下去，因而好多地方上的地痞流氓把持了地方的實權，胡作非爲」，針對着這一種不良的現實，我們該拿出一股力量來加以糾正和改進！</p>
<h3>紀念昌濰戰役　追悼殉難軍民　哀樂與熱淚交流　王耀武沉痛致詞</h3>
<p>〔本報濟南十二日電（遲到）〕魯各界以最沉痛心情，於十二晨九時聯合舉行張故委員天佐曁昌濰淄博戰役殉難軍民追悼會，到千餘人，由王耀武親臨主祭，並以極沉痛語調致詞，「此次昌濰戰役，張故委員殺身成仁，自戮而死，我們應一致效法張烈士之犧牲精神來戡亂，政府以及報章曾對王鳳崗的戰策有顯著獎勵，然而我們的張故委員是可以與王鳳崗媲美的，他不僅爲家鄉揚眉，亦爲山東吐氧，因此我們應效法張烈士的辦法，並發揚光大其精神。」王氏爲達此目的，並當塲決定於十三晨八時，即就原地舉行禮前檢討會，規定地方部隊營長以上均出席，凡忠勇的從優獎賞，凡從本心內忽略了官長，忽略了士兵，忽略了人民的人，一律嚴懲，絕不寬貸。繼由義議長等相繼發言，激昂悲壯，聲淚俱下。至十一時此「勳績留千古，義烈壯三齊」之歷史大典，於哀樂熱淚聲中，穴吿禮成。</p>
<h3>美專家葛萊琪生等　應邀參加研究楊妺　陳志潛博士談考驗工作</h3>
<p>〔本報重慶十三日電〕甫自京返渝之前川省衛生處長現任渝中央醫院兼重大醫學院院長陳志潛博士，此次在滬，曾晤美援華醫藥會主委劉瑞恒博士，劉對楊妹九年不食，亦抱懷疑，惟巳邀美國著名生理學家葛萊琪生（Gregerson）及助手羅特（Root）日後參加研究楊妹。葛已離美，頃在來華途中，羅已抵京，渠等原係應邀於七月在中大講學一月，八月一日即來渝，籌劃重大醫學院有關生理部門事宜。陳對衛生局初步觀察楊妹方法，確認欠週密，渠申述物質永久存在，迄今尚未發現不能沒有物質產生物質的理論，故研究楊妹不僅是醫學界的責任，應動員科學界對此有深刻研究者參加，渠對任何位醫生願意參與檢查楊妹及發表意見事，表示異議，因爲研究是一套學問，且須熟悉文件紀載，對自己所作結論更能獲得其他科學家之設明無誤，始可下斷語，渠並舉例解釋戰前德某生理學家試驗心臟跳動，用儀器紀載，俾證明心臟作用經過若干次試臉，自己紀錄一致符合，且均與過去醫學界紀錄不相同，致橝動全球，引起科學界之重視，科學家集體向渠試驗室研究結果，發現渠試騐室試騐所用電力，因接通另一電綫，不用心臟也可得同樣波浪跳動紀錄，鬧成一大笑話，科學不是某個人可以包辦，在研究楊妹前，各種因素，如時間·設備·人員之配合等，均需詳密準備，故渠主張楊妹檢查事，俟葛·羅·等專家抵渝後再議，最爲妥善。未確實證明前，不要傳說太多。渠與劉瑞恒之意見一致，即要做這種工作研究者，一定要熟悉研究對象，此非器重生物營養專家不可。渠等日常研究動物營養，現由研究兎鼠等轉移至楊妹身上，雖對象不同，方法則一，僅觀察現象，不能證實研究的正確性。張羣在渝，曾與渠詳談楊妹渠强調考騐不應有時間限制，科學的發現絕不能有疑惑存在，旁人對此發生疑問，即是此科學上有問題，科學上每一新發現，決非一蹴可成，平常小試騐，都易出漏洞，何况楊妹這麽重大的事情。</p>

<p>〔路透社英格蘭歇斐爾十二日電〕貝文外相在此發表公開演說，主張給予德國以重爲國際家庭一份子的機會。渠對德國之期望，乃爲盼其能以和平方法而非使用刀劍，以與其隣邦共處。渠對戰後歐洲問題之尚未能解決，表示遺憾，但對組織西歐之工作，巳獲進展，表示欣慰。</p>
<p>切盼猶阿息爭</p>
<p>關於巴勒斯坦問題，渠希望巴勒斯坦猶阿兩族得獲解決辦法，蓋猶阿同爲寶密族，僅宗敎信仰不同而己。因此猶阿之間，不應不能有解決辦法，以達到和平共處的目的。</p>
<p>戰債二百億鎊</p>
<p>述及歐洲復興方案及戰爭的代價時，渠謂英國已支出浩大的戰爭代價，並負有二百億鎊的債務。英國若計算自戰爭開始以迄結束所耗去的金錢，則英國在歐洲復興方案下取得的費用，祗爲英國可已耗去之一極小部份耳。總之，目前祗盼戰爭不致再度發生，果爾則英鎊債務及戰債均將不致發生矣。</p>
<h3>羅國承認以色列</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社布加萊斯特十二日電〕羅馬尼亞政府己於今日承認以色列國並已通知該國臨時政府。</p>
<h3>聖地休戰監察員　作實地調查</h3>
<p>〔路透社倫敦十二日電〕休戰令生效以後廿四小時後，巴勒斯坦之戰事仍未停止。猶太方面報告阿拉伯軍在迦列里海迤南發動攻勢，而叙利亞軍亦指猶軍進攻叙利亞軍防綫之南部，聯合國之休戰監督員業已馳往兩地調查。據本社海發來電貝那多特之私人參謀，聯合國高級監督休戰員史發萊伐爾上校，已日海發飛往大馬色，調查巴勒斯坦叙利亞邊界之戰鬥，其餘休戰　察員則赴迦列里海區調查猶方所稱阿拉伯軍進攻湖邊猶太移民區艾恩蓋勃之說。</p>
<p>華盛頓來電，謂美國業已同意以巡　艇三艘及飛機三架，供給貝那多特之休戰監察團使用。美政府並願意再派軍官午名協助貝那多特監督休戰，連前共派之軍官廿一名共卅一名。倫敦英外部發言人證實貝那多特已請英國供給休戰監察員所需的海空運輸工具，但該發言人表示，不信將有英國人員參加貝那多特之休戰監察團，或在羅特島上舉行之猶阿和平談判。</p>
<h3>西方盟國在德境內　發動政治新攻勢　旨在籌組全德統一政府</h3>
<p>〔聯合社柏林十三日電〕西方各國已在德境對蘇聯發動戰後初次大規模政治攻勢，目的不僅在政治上爭取西德，且擬爭取全部德國，包括蘇聯控制之東德在內。蘇聯對於該一攻勢之反饗，或可決定東西雙方最近是否將有造成戰爭之危險。簡言之，亦即倫敦六國會議之意義所在。</p>
<p>一般認爲蘇聯旣未出席倫敦會議，該會決議設立之聯邦政府，自僅以英美法三國佔領區爲限，但官方表示並無如此限制之意。反之，將鼓勵德人設立一個有權代表全部德國之政府。據美軍總督克萊昨日宣稱，弗朗克福政府擬儘量包括德國大部份地區，若謂不能代表東德，殊無理由。同時，德國政治領袖幾乎無不反對設立限於西德之政府，一部份人士主張東部佔領區亦應派遣代表參加未來內閣。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社柏林十二日電〕美駐德佔領軍總司令克萊將軍今日在記者招待會上稱，「西佔區之幣制改革案，目前尚未獲得最後決議，在獲得是項決定後，我人當立即通知蘇方。柏林西部是否應包括在是項改革之中，目前亦未確定一。述及六國對德協議時，克來稱，「今並未　迫德國」人民建立西德政府，我人希望德國人民能有負賣之政府，解決其本身之問題。然彼等有絕對之自由選擇政府之方式與成立之日期」。記者詢及爲何美軍將安哈爾特站之德國火車頭移走，克萊答稱，是種火車頭極有價億，須加以保震，美當局不欲將之自德國取走，然美軍　予以必要之保護。</p>
<h3>美參院撥疑會通過　撥四十億元援歐　縮短時間供十二個月用</h3>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓十二日電〕美參院撥款委會今日通過撥付援歐計劃四十億元，此舉將衆議院決定削减之數目大部份恢復。該委會並決定撥款供十二個月之用，以代替衆院規定之十五個月。主席白里奇稱：決議案將衆院批准之給予經濟合作總署之經費，增加九億五千萬元。參院外委會主席范登堡今日曾親自出席撥款委會會議，要求恢復衆院削减之部份。依照委會決議，經濟合作總署所得經費總額，將爲五十億五千五百萬元，政府原來要求則爲五十三億元。</p>
<h3>各國反對美扶植日本　美當局甚感棘手　國務院籌謀消除疑慮</h3>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓十二日電〕權威方面十二日稱：美國正計劃加緊宣傳，俾向他國解釋其對日政策。美國官員數週來，對中國及其他國家抗議美國恢復日本經濟至相對高度水準之計劃一事，日益感到棘手。彼等以爲除非採取對抗行動，否則美國與昔日盟友之關係將趨緊張，益使合作困難。國務院亦擬解除認爲日本繁榮後將再度威脅世界和平諸人之杞憂，其技巧乃爲提出環境及保　，美官員認爲此兩者足以說明日本無法再度威脅和平。</p>
<h3>日捕鯨成績</h3>
<p>〔聯合社東京十三日電〕捕鯨公司三家自本年四月一日至六月八日在此間北約二百哩金華山附近海面捕獲小鯨一百卅三條，預料在九月底以前，可再捕獲一百條，造成新紀錄。大部份鯨肉已供各大城市配給之用。</p>
<h3>東歐三國承認　印尼共和國</h3>
<p>〔路透社巴　維亞十二日電〕印尼共和國報紙載未證實之報告稱，波蘭。羅馬尼亞·保加利亞三國已承認印尼共和國，此事係由印尼共和國駐普拉格代表蘇里波來電通知。</p>
<h3>法國會續辯西德協定　皮杜爾遭遇難關　左翼議員攻擊府不遣余力</h3>
<p>〔路透社巴黎十二日電〕國民議會辯論倫敦六國會議協　巳至第二日，除外長皮杜爾一人發表之演辭外，其他尚未有人提出贊成的意見。議塲沉悶之空氣，反使觀察家懷疑於遷二恢復辯諭時，政府殆將不獲使國會批准該一六國協議。最使政府感覺刺激者，乃爲當皮杜爾致辭之際，全塲僅人民共和黨議員及少數緩進派偶或報以掌聲，而當左翼議員前航空部長戈德發言要求拒絕倫敦會議建議時，反數度發出熱烈掌聲。</p>
<p>當戈德述及「如果我們說一是」，在數星期的短時期內雖　使我國對英美的關係較易應付，但以後的困難必與日俱增「一語時，全塲每一角落均報以熱烈　聲。戈德並日，「對於這種不顧納粹被害國合理要求的決議，如果我們說「是」則以後勢必永遠說「是」，我們不可以爲馬歇爾援助之獲得，有賴於我國之批准六國建議，如果確實如此，即可證明某方而指責美國發動馬歇爾援助的動機，確有其事。如果我們說「不」，則整個歐洲復興問題，可以更廣大而更好的基礎，予以重新考慮而不政僅僅成爲美蘇鬥爭中的一種具有政洽動機的行動。本人切盼　歐對於此一六國建議，能報以一佩「不」字，不妨以外交辭令，以最客氣的方式報以「不」字，但我們的態度必須保持堅決。若干觀察家咸認國會就該事辯論兩日後，已使全國發生六國建議不利於法國的印象，甚至社會黨秘書長菲力浦亦已表示社會黨在決定支援政府以前，尚擬獲取更多的保證。皮杜爾昨日所發表歷時兩小時的致辭，祗證實了法國所贊成之唯一有效的一官制魯爾制度，巳遭倫敦會　拒絕，而皮杜爾並已承認西歐之軍事安全，尚未有確切保障。</p>
<h3>亞經會會通過　減低米價</h3>
<p>〔聯合社印度奧達卡蒙十二日電〕聯合國亞洲及遠東經濟委員會第三屆會議，十二日辯論加入聯合國糧食農業機構等案後，即吿結束。會中緬甸提議减低米價，錫蘭及英國贊助，惟美國反對，謂其問題過大，不能實行，此案經討論後，仍獲通過。</p>

<h3>杜勒斯反共論　堅守信念爭取勝利</h3>
<p>〔路透社紐約州許奈克泰迪城十三日電〕共和黨外交專家杜勒斯今日在此間聯合學院畢業典禮中發表演說，重申其强烈的反共產主義意見。他說，共產主義目前的挑戰，欲使自由社會處於保持現狀者的地位，而共產主義則爲改革的先鋒，因此吾人決不可允許被共產主義拖入死亡的陷穽中。共產主義所要求的改革，爲惡劣而自敗的方法，因此我們決不能接受共產主義。在目前人類所進行的思想與精神鬥爭中，祗有具有堅强信念者，始能獲得勝利。</p>
<h3>邱吉爾獅吼　痛工黨內閣</h3>
<p>〔合衆社倫教十二日電〕反對黨領袖邱吉爾今日在保守黨集會上發表演說稱：渠感覺「現政府之壽命如再延長，則吾人將陷入不可挽救之危境。」邱翁指斥英國依賴美國爲一「可怖之事實」。渠稱；渠原希望一九四五年獲得之美國貸款，能使英國度過戰爭至和平之過渡階段，使英國在戰爭窮乏之後，能獲得一喘息機會，以便整頓事業。但上項貸款在兩年來浪費殆盡，使吾人又不得不再度依賴美國之「慷慨」，同時，吾人正將剩餘之海外投資，及過去在資本主義體制下累積之資產，不斷消耗至形將枯竭之境地。</p>
<p>如工黨政府繼續執政，則最具能力及機智之英國人，均將移居國外，國內所僅有者，唯一羣官吏與大批飢民而巳。吾人在世界上之地位，不但個人之自尊性將完全喪失，即國家之獨立亦將不保。</p>
<h3>蘇報攻擊戰敗　馬卿列名在內</h3>
<p>〔聯合社莫斯科十二日電〕蘇聯文學雜誌今日以全幅地位，揭載四篇論文，攻擊鼓動戰爭者，馬歇爾亦被列名在內。該報以美大使史密斯爲接收國務部之軍閥系，並以美戰略空軍主任凱奈與德國戈林相比。</p>

<h3>醫學界新發明　原子針治癌病</h3>
<p>〔聯合社紐約十二日電〕科學日報載稱：醫學界已發明原子針洽癌法。針用鈷與鎳製成，在原子堆或原子爐中短時期鍛鍊後取出，針上即射出宛似　錠之光綫，但更爲有力。原子針可做成彎曲形，適合病情，此乃　錠針所不能。又　錠針爲空心針，內注鐳氣，有時不免漏氣，危及病體，原子針爲實心針，無此危險。原子針具有磁性作用，可用磁石作柄，　錠針則必須用欽子夾住。</p>

<h3>市商會電呈立法院　反對徵收財產稅　認爲清查豪門整飭稅政　已可節制資本平均財富</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕上海市商會爲報載立法院討論臨時財產稅條例草案，如果通過實施，必致流弊業生，因特電呈立法院，詳陳該稅不能成立之理由，認爲祗須淸查豪門整飭稅政，巳可節制資本平均財富。</p>

<h3>姬覺彌家庭糾紛　相當復雜之內幕　受多妻之累·因財產起爭　暝蛉諸兒求父維持生活　母子被訴可能別生枝節</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕本月七日本報曾經刊載過「姬覺彌家庭糾紛，起訴男女兩被吿新聞一則，這段新聞表面平凡而簡單，也許不大受人注意，但內中却有複雜異常耐人尋味之一段故事，熟悉內幕者預言，這次毁損案，可能爲若干年後一件大訟案之先聲。</p>
<p>七日新聞中叙述被吿　陸靑與子姬毓鵬，於本年四月二十六日至原吿　范福彌住宅尋夫被拒，一時氣憤，搗毀其灶問內餐具及玻窗，汽車等　件，此案經李朝柱檢察官偵查終結，認爲兩被吿，有毁損　嫌，向地院刑庭提起公訴</p>
<p>毁損案之起訴書中雖未指明趙陸靑所　之夫係何人，但記者巳在新聞中釋明此爲猶太富商哈同總　房　覺彌之家庭糾紛，姬氏之一生旣與哈同已發生不可分離之關係，姬氏之家庭糾紛當亦必與愛園園有所關聯。</p>
<p>相憐同病·伯道無兒</p>
<p>哈同生前對姬覺彌之信任，早爲人所熟悉，姬氏在哈同榮哀錄中自比管鮑謂「誼同昆弟，肩隨三十載，　管鮑之契結，師耶律之持服」。及羅迦陵繼承夫業，對姬氏倚畀益重，愛　園內外事務一人總攬，名份上亦巳由賓主而爲義姊弟矣。哈同夫婦不能生育，男女一無所出，姬覺彌竟亦有此缺陷，三人同病相隣，爲子嗣煩惱，因此曾立志，三人共同領養義子女一百名，此項計劃雖未完全賞現，但當時確曾收養貧兒孤女達數十人之多，嗣後一再　　淘汰，哈同認領四子六女，以哈同爲姓，羅迦陵認領五子三女，以羅氏爲姓，姬覺彌認領四子，以姬爲姓，分別取名毓生，毓龍，毓强，毓鵬，此項義子女，一律呼哈同爲父（Father），呼羅迦陵爲「娘」，呼姬覺彌爲「爸爸」「爹爹」或「叔叔」，姬覺彌之四子亦在愛儷園生中長、與其他義子女受同等待遇，羅迦陵對之亦想若己出，不稍歧視。</p>
<p>戰事爆發罷　息爭　棄嫌修好成立和解</p>
<p>民國卅年十月羅迦陵病逝，當時出現遺囑兩張，一以　治哈同爲子要繼承人，一以姬覺彌爲主要繼承人，雙方互不相讓，涉訟於英駐滬法庭，未二月太平洋戰爭爆發，遺產訟案無形停頓，全部遺產悉被日軍佔領管理，姬覺彌與喬治哈同棄嫌修好，成立和解，所有義子女均有遺產分得，姬覺彌得南京路慈淑里，九江路慈益里及愛儷園沿福煦路基地六畝等房地產，獨毓生，毓龍，毓强，毓鵬四人，雖同屬義子〔呼羅迦陵爲娘〕，然格於名份，對羅迦陵遺產無繼承之權，而其義父能度亦日淅冷淡，更進而拒絕經濟上之負祖，同時亦漸不容於愛儷園，除毓生因與羅氏弟兄感情尚佳，准許其留居於園中車棚內外，毓龍現携眷居於某小旅館中，毓强，毓鵬〔均未成家〕二人遷居陜西北路一一九弄廿八號，該處係姬覺彌之妻王誠正之居所，王氏現年四十四歲，於民國十四五年間與最近被起訴之趙陸育女士，同一時期內與姬覺彌同居者。</p>
<p>南洋路主宅　主權成問題</p>
<p>民國卅一年，姬氏又因「天錄婚姻介紹所」之介紹，結識毁損案中之原吿范福彌，並即實行同居，自此姬對王趙每月僅分別遺　致送少量之生活費，而絕足不再往王趙兩處，王氏因此刺激患精神病，已臥床數年，惟眷念舊情，頗不願與姬決裂。趙陸靑自失歡於姬氏後亦因經濟桔据，於上月間擬將南陽路一四五號住宅一所售予基督敎徒聚會所，買主委託費席珍律師於五月廿五·廿六·廿七日在甲新兩報刊登徵詢異議廣吿，至同月二十八日忽有張世英律師代表覺彌商行出面干涉，謂該處產業係行主前以堂名出面之財產，未經本行主之　而同意，任何人不得有所主張。據記者探悉：該花園洋房住宅係戰前　覺彌購置予趙陸靑居住者，買受時戶名係「潘錦樂」，但何以不用「姬或「趙」而用「潘」，亦有一番來歷。據傳姬覺彌原爲「潘」姓故鄕在汀蘇唯寗自來滬後乃改姓爲姬，「錦樂」係姬爲趙所取之別號，至王誠正則亦有別名曰一豐樂」。故趙陸靑認爲此主宅乃姬所贈予之財產，彼絕對有　自由處分。</p>
<p>由暗門而入明爭</p>
<p>惟醞釀出售之先，趙曾屢次向姬徵求意見，但均無結果，四月廿六日再往河南路三八二弄六號尋姬，乃與范福彌發生衝突，造成毁損案，此後趙陸靑毅然決定出售，不料姬覺彌亦即公開反對，於是姬貿彌之家庭糾紛由暗門而入明爭。毓生等四兄弟亦早聘有法律顧問，向義父交涉，請求給予若干資金，或給予職業以雜持生活。惟此案發生後，形勢激變，毓鵬等四人認爲毁損案之原吿雖爲范福彌，而彼等之父實有左右之權，今竟爲此細故控吿子與妻，有背常情，深恐將有更不幸之事件發生，故每日奔走求助於戚友律師間，惶惶不可終日也。</p>

<h3>一般物價　消息利多買氣旺盛　各物上漲再接再厲</h3>
<p>上週物價繼前週末市之後，週初開盤，因消息利多，買氣興隆，各物漲勢，再接再勵，新高價層見迭出，氣勢汹湧，迄至週末尚無稍戢現象，顯示又一新漲風業已襲來。當局雖力謀緊急措施，加强管制，抽緊銀根，但敵不過相反因素的力量，使措施的壓力，爲之冲淡，故煞費苦心，尚難收實效。</p>
<p>本刊所編之批發物價總指數上週計上升百分之二一·五五。上週銀根始終在鬆弛狀態中，國行交換情形，除週四因食糖紗布等結款，計差進一萬三千餘億外，其餘每日差進額，均不到七千億，國行同業定存，截至週四止，總額且累積達二萬五千億之鉅。暗息徘徊於三角以內。至於港滙行情，上週頻頻趨縮，迭創新紀錄。茲將造成此次物價新漲風之各項因素，歸納分析如次：</p>
<p>第一，國營事業價格調整：（一）六月五日起全國輪船客貨運價漲百分之九十，惟台灣至上海客運以台幣計算漲百分之廿五，貨運未加。（二）六月七日起中國中央兩航空公司各票運價調整，計南路綫（包括港·厦·台·汕·）按原價漲百分之八十五，西路綫（包括渝·筑·昆·蓉·）漲百分之六十五，北路綫（包括靑·濟·平·潘·）漲百分之五十五。（三）六月七日起全國鐵路客貨運價調整計客票按原價漲百分之五十，普通貨運漲百分之九十，貴重貨運漲百分之一百二十。（四）本市各項公用事業於六月十二日起調整新價，水電上漲約百分之卅五。這一連串的漲價，使貨物運輸成本激增，物價怎能不漲，如滬市的米價，就在鐵路貨運運價調整的次日，每石普漲五六十萬元。</p>
<p>第二，銀根鬆濫。銀根鬆濫的原因很多，最根本的當然還是政府支出浩大，收入不能平衡，靠發行來彌補，以致通貨膨脹，物價繼漲不息，政府平抑物價，不能從此根本處着手，結果一切治標的措施，終難奏效。據報載今年下半年國家總預算是照上半年度的預算數字比照物價指數增加，按上半年預算收入總額爲五十八萬餘億元，支出總額爲九十六萬餘億元，依此計算，今年下半年度的支出額約達三百六十萬億元，這是一個如何駭人聽聞的數字。在這個根本的原因之外，最近偶然發生的有：（一）萬元的關金劵傳即將由國行發行，流通市面，則鈔票的面額，將創二十萬元的新紀錄。（二）自當局於六月一日起禁止票據當日抵用實施以後，本刊即曾述及，想藉此舉以减少到通貨流通速度，達到穩定物價的目的，殊有問題。據金管局負責人稱：最近市上本票發行激增，據檢查結果，大致情形尚稱良好，且多係應客戶實際需要開發者。此種大量高額的本票流通市面，結果自然使信用擴張；通貨流通速度增加，誘致物價的上漲。（三）近來市上銀根鬆動，現鈔充斥，據傳每日自華北運來的現鈔達一萬億以上。</p>
<p>第三，國行俞總裁於週一發表全力扶植生產事業談話稱：「（一）中央銀行今後將儘力扶植正當生產事業，以重貼現或轉抵押之方式貸予資金，並將領導各商業行莊從事於推動生產及開發國家資源之責任。（二）今後國行對國家行局及民營金融機構，在扶植生產事業之前題下，無分軒輊，將同等予以融通資金之便利。（三）國行將儘力設法引導社會游資入於生產之途，目前發行之短期庫券，其目的並非用以平衡財政，而在吸收社會游資，導入生產途徑。過去因銀行存款利率過低，致游資大量流入投機市塲。今後此種現象，自可减少。（四）今後國行之措施，旣已扶植生產事業爲目的，各工商事業單位，自可儘量力圖發展，並希望各商業行莊與國行通力合作，以期完成此項任務。」自此項談話發表後，隔日股市飛漲，因爲大家對今後的生產事業，有了一種新的預測，增加投資興趣，市氣欣欣向榮。我們對兪氏的談話在原則上是同意的，不過在運用的技術上，要特別注重眞正的從事生產工作與吸收的投機取巧之間的區別，因爲稍一不愼，所得的結果，可能差之毫政，失之千里。</p>
<p>第四，關於政府拋售物資政策，最近拋售的數量，愈來愈少，售價在逐步提高，這種舉棋不定的做法，無　給投機家一種引誘。如政府前曾拋售食米，自前週起，即宣吿停止。花紗布方面，傳經濟部以存底無多，曾有令飭紗管會停止拋售之說，市價頗有因此轉移之趨勢。就配價說，如十六支仙女紗由週初之二二，二〇〇萬元提升至週末之二六，五〇〇萬元，漢口細絨由六月一日之三，四〇〇萬元提升至六月十二日之四，八〇〇萬元。台糖的配價亦由於台幣滙價的連續調整在提升中，上週台幣滙價週一爲三七五元，週三爲三九〇元，週四爲四〇一元，週末爲四二〇元</p>
<p>上週市塲物價的走勢，在高峯上賡續前進，幾每日均創新價，尤以糧食，紡織品，金屬，化學品等類爲甚，各種指數均升百分之廿以上。上週股市，在前述數大因素刺激下，復因港滙猛縮，外滙牌價又有調整之說，堅挺異常，週五永紗曾見三八一五元之高價，後以三七〇〇元收盤，創新紀錄，在此種趨勢下，外股亦極堅俏，週五怡紗站五八一萬之高價。紗市方面，週末四十二支藍鳳站四七，五〇〇萬高價，廿一支雙馬站三一，〇〇〇萬高價，龍頭細布站叩一千萬大關。食米因蘇錫產價報漲，市價頻頻上升，週末北市塲上白粳價迫九百萬元高峯，塲外喊價尚超過此數，其餘雜糧油粉等，亦均追踪猛漲，週五爲端陽節，糧食市塲全部無市。日用品如肥皂火柴等，由高峯盤旋前進，週末固本皂破千萬元關。化學品如一百公斤月牌燒碱由週初之一九，五〇〇萬漲至週五之二二，四〇〇萬元。</p>

<p>上週週五，適逢端節，照例佳節前後，市塲舊欠，結淸者多，勢必影響銀根收歛。但是今歲客觀條件，已與往昔不同，通貨膨脹，日積月累，雖行局一再設法抽緊銀根，仍未獲預期之效果，一面拋售物資，禁止當日支票抵用，一面却關金大票，源源運來，據上週週三報載，新鈔二百箱，由英運滬，總値達四十萬億之鉅，雖說當局爲鎭壓汹湧游資，已組成所謂「銀根會報」，但一手發鈔，一手收鈔，其間所發必遠超所收之數，才能彌補今日巨額之財政赤字，這可說是目前銀根不易抽緊的癥結所在，至於北資南流，南資倒流，本票替代支票等等，不過是惡性通貨膨脹中的派生現象，根源不究，枝節問題不易解決。所以儘管有合乎天時的端陽佳節，有人爲因素的抽緊銀根，一週來的銀根仍見一片鬆濫。</p>
<p>上週暗息，以二角七分最爲普遍，週末以銀根益濫，竟有做二角四分而不易外拆者，證券帮塲外貼息，亦見趨降，週一承前週週末原盤，計多方每股貼出卅五元，空方每股貼進卅一元，週二至週四降至卅四元與卅元，週五再各降一元。</p>
<p>國家行局庫，自週一至週五雖交換差進達三萬〇七百五十八億，較前週增進一萬二千六百二十七億，但如扣除同期內商業銀行於央行的定存計二萬七千多億，行局實際差進不過二三千億，二三千億的頭寸收入，對於泛濫的游資市塲，其作用自然是微乎其微了！</p>
<p>外商銀行自週一至週五共差進七千七百二十億，較前週同期內减進四千四百〇八億。</p>
<p>商業行莊，多單普遍，現鈔本票，均感寬裕，同業拆放，少有做開，六十號以後行莊交換結果，自週一至週五計共差出二萬二千一百四十一億，較前週同期內猶增出達一萬〇六百四十二億，但市面銀根並不因此而感緊歛，可見游資洶湧之一般。</p>
<p>（二）內外匯率</p>
<p>上週外滙行市，基準率未動，惟結滙證明書價格受外象影響，續見高抬，週五一度達六十二萬，但成交數不大。香港申滙，繼續縮短，週一十萬法幣合港幣四角一分，週二至週四，短至三角九分。香港黃金每華兩自週一之三三一·五港元迭縮至週四之三二九元，美鈔市價則大致在五元五角四五分之間。</p>
<p>上週本市內滙滙率，普見提高，穗滙滙水前週週末不過八十元，上週一升至一百二十元週二至週五，續升至一百五十元，資金南流，勢又加劇。厦匯滙水自週一至週四爲一百二十元，週五降至一百元，漢滙亦見提升，週一滙水爲三十元，週四已升至六十元，週五略回爲五十元，渝滙在週三以前爲貼水二十元，但週四週五，已改爲匯水二十元。津匯在週四以前，雖大致穩定爲貼水五十元，但週五貼水遽升一倍，爲一百元，北資南流，又有轉劇之趨勢。</p>
<p>（三）華洋股市</p>
<p>週初外埠游資湧到，又値本票流行日增，銀根鬆濫，外象物價均起激烈漲風，人心一致看好，華股亦不例外，永紗一度曾見三三九〇元，後以大戶獲利吐售，回小至三五一五〇元收市。華新水泥因有特殊利多消息，獨漲停板。週二銀根仍形鬆濫，謠傳放寬工商貸款，人心興奮，永紗創三四四〇高價。各股均見上升成交數額頗旺。週三游資集滬更多，外象愈形堅挺，華股漲勢益厲，永紗越三千六百元關，中泥信誼中絲，均登漲限。各股其未達漲　者，亦均升成半，成交數額亦猛烈增加。週四初開，永紗承前幾日之漲風，一度竄升三七一〇元新高峯，但散戶步伐不穩，獲利有售，挫落至三千五百元關。信和爲一一三〇元，新光做四十二元，景福僅二十一元一角。周五欣逢舊歷端節，華股再現秀色，永紗高價頻見，曾急進至三八一五元新盤，他股皆見上升，且達漲限者計十五種，爲大通，榮豐，新光，景福，景綸，動興，美亞，中興，信誼，火柴，華豐，中泥，中法，新華，商務等，如火如荼，均似來賀佳節。週末永紗以連日上升過猛，走勢趨穩，其他中小型股，多氣勢轉秀，追踪上升。</p>
<p>周初港滙報縮，黑市混亂，人心活躍，爭相購買，各股全面上挺，後以當局將有嚴重壓力，遂稍回落，怡紗以五二〇元收市，英聯喊價六二〇萬元，會德豐叩一二〇〇萬關。周二因銀根奇鬆，各股再吿挺升，會德豐較前漲百萬，英聯升念萬，怡紗回上三十五萬。周三黑市更形激漲，銀根濫極，人心遂愈加興奮，各股均升，以怡紗上漲較多，達五七五萬元。英聯爲六五五萬元，會德豐爲一三二〇萬元。周四港滙仍縮，黑市上挺甚多，惟因港市之外股，有倒流之現象，買賣雙方，均持觀望，勢趨疲軟，英聯怡紗均開始下降，恰紗爲五六二萬，英聯爲六五三萬，會德豐獨升至一三七〇萬元。周五，人心仍持觀望，交易淸淡，走勢參差，會德豐叩一四〇〇萬關，怡紗升見五八三萬，英聯爲六七〇萬元。週末因外象各物，升見新高價，外股亦多創新價，怡紗午收爲六〇〇萬元，英聯爲六九〇萬元，會德豐爲一五〇〇萬元。</p>
<h3>工商動態</h3>
<p>新外匯辦法的考驗</p>
<p>自新外匯辦法公佈以後，多方的反響，雖可云毁譽參半，但新辦法的實施技術，迄今未能予以澈底改善，又因新辦法的公佈而引起的其他經濟因素的變動，如出口物資國內價格上漲及國外價格的跌落，黑市外匯價格的繼續昂騰等，無不大大的减低了新制成功的可能性。茲就一週來新外匯辦法給予工商界的新威脅列述如下：</p>
<p>（一）據中國棉織業產銷聯營公司負責人稱：結匯新辦法雖已實施，但迄今止棉織品尚未見諸輸出，考其原因，結匯證明書市價太低，且都是幾家大銀行所做之少數交易，不能作爲一般的看法，中國棉織品在南洋羣島的市塲又將被日本所奪取，故以後棉織品外銷將更形困難。</p>
<p>（二）據腸衣輸出商方面消息：結匯證明書辦法公佈後，國內陽衣價格每副漲達十三萬至十五萬元，但美國市塲價格，每副以結匯證明書價格核算之，只合十二萬至十三萬元，故陽衣輸出，困難如舊。</p>
<p>（三）據某桐油出口商稱，最近桐油，仍未見輸出，因結匯證明書與黑市價格，相差達百分之六十，目前桐油在紐約市塲每磅二角四分，相等於上海碼頭交貨二角一分，以結匯證明書市價折算，每擔以合二千一百萬元，但目前桐汕市價已達二千零五十萬元，故其出口依然因難。另據中信局消息，美國進口商握存桐油均將競先出售，而美國政府前向美植桐商人購進一六〇〇噸，擬於近期內標售，對我桐油銷路影饗亦不小。</p>
<p>（四）就猪鬃外銷情况說，據中信局消息，國外猪鬃行市亦因新外匯辦法而見紛亂，國內發價求售者雖多，國外買主均不還價，行情因與前週相同，但均有行無市</p>
<p>（五）因新外匯辦法公佈而引起的公用事業所需外匯結匯問題，雖經參議會　大員晉京請願，要求當局按中央銀行牌價結匯，但據大公社訊，水，電，煤氣，電話等四項，因各公司虧蝕過鉅，其調整新價日期，又延遲甚久，故市府正考慮恢復追加辦法，並可能於六月六日起追收，看來公用事業又面臨非再作一次提價不可的時候了。</p>
<p>（六）本來，新外匯辦法的目的之一，爲以進口所需的外匯寄諸出口所得的外匯上，現在出口的能否推廣，旣如上述，大成問題，則所謂放寬生產器材進口云云，勢成泡影，例如輸管會於十日召開會議，討論附表一生產器材進口問題，但據說因「礙於外匯之困難，故仍未有具體決定。」前有人以新外匯辦法看作頗具「進出口連鎖」之精神，現事實證明進出口仍處「脫節」的情况中。</p>
<p>（七）外匯頭寸的入不敷出及新外匪辦法不能連鎖進出口貿易的另一例證，充份表露於最近所爆發的燃油恐慌中，報載本市美孚等三外商油公司，因輸出人管理委員會對三公司供應中國中央及空運大隊之飛機用油限額遲遲未予批准，致三公司於三日聯合通知中國中央及空運大隊自六日起停止供應汽油　輸管會乃於四日批准三公司供給民航用油限額爲廿五萬美元，但據說此數只能維持一個月。三油公司又於上週二以結匪證明書爲理由，突通知中央中國二航空公司，以油價提升百分之八十，民運航空之危機，亦在方興未艾之中。又輪船業公會之用油結匯簡題亦未吿解決，雖然說當局因美援中已列有柴油，汽油，及其他燃料油類等而五六兩季進口限額中全部剔除此項油類的限額分配，但於此亦不難看出當局因外匯頭寸短少所表現之窘相，甚爲明顯，如果美援仍遲遲不能具體動用或一再削减，則危急的大局，眞是難以支撑吧！</p>
<p>（八）增加僑匯收入恐怕是新外匯辦法的積極目的之一，但據報載僑胞匯款回國，雖由於新制的公佈，可望略予增加，然以黑市與結匯辦法所獲得之匯價相較，相距仍多，而手續上又諸多因難，致吸收僑匯，前途仍未可樂觀。</p>
<p>新外匯辦法的是否能成功，固然目前尙難得一定論，但牠是否經得起一連串現實的考驗，已經逐漸在表現出來。無疑的，新辦法會如老辦法一樣，經過牠應經的歲月，但是一個「辦法」實施年月的久暫，並不是該辦法成敗的標準，從局部看或就針對某一部份人的利益說，這是一個比較成功的「辦法」，因此也就多拖延了一些時日，但就整體看，就長期看，同一「辦法」又未始不能是造成更大紊亂更大困難的前奏曲。在目前，主要的原則可說是定了的，在不變的原則下要找些頭痛醫頭脚痛醫脚的藥方，雖然每爲一些「不唱高調」或所謂「技術專家所樂從，但「醫得頭來脚又痛」的現象必然由此發生，不但如此，隨着時日的變遷社會條件的變遷，第二次的「頭痛脚痛」，假如比第一次的更擴大更劇烈，那末第一次治療的評價，又何能目之為成功呢！</p>

<h3>僑校代表籲請讓步　向暹提出四項要求　已由暹教次詳細解答</h3>
<p>〔中央社受谷十二日電〕中國駐暹大使館十二日向暹外部提出新照會，俾謀目前僑校問題之合理解決之際，僑校敎師代表已再度向暹敎育部籲請讓步之請求，代表等所提出之四項請求，巳由暹敎次乃蘇克地予以詳細解答，茲錄如下：第一項要求指稱敎授中文之學校，與其他私立學校不同，吾人要求特別待遇，暹敎部答稱；本部之政筑無所歧視於某國或某族之私立學校，且一切此類私立學校均係依據同一法令而開辦。第二項要求有關前鑒貪隆政府與中國大使館所簽訂之協定，遵敎部答稱：此項協定，刻正確切實施中，華僑自己有所誤解，因渠等之要求者遠超出其依據協定所應享有者，「中暹友好條約第六條，明文載定締約國雙方之國民在遵守所在國之法令及規章情形下得自行設立學校，以敎育其子女，並得享有集會，結社，出版，宗敎信仰之自由」，同時暹方則竭力强調遵守所在國家法令及規章一語。第三項要求爲何以華僑學校不能獲准收容八歲至十五歲之學童，暹敎次答覆稱：華僑學校在依照私立學校法規之規定後，將可獲准。第四項要求爲暹敎部可對戰時證書遺失之華僑學校敎師加以認可之，暹敎次答覆稱：暹敎部不能根據謠傳採取行動，無論如何，此一問題之補救辦法現已存在，「暹敎部認爲一切關於戰時敎師證書遺失之傳說，均係謠傳，任何合格敎師可申請故試，從而證明其資格，任何人都可事此便利，事實上僅有少數敎師可以通過攷試，因攷試對於暹文之合格標準訂有嚴格之規定」。八歲至十五歲學童之未能入學及足額敎師人員之缺乏，乃暹境各華僑學校事實上均需停開之直接因素。</p>

<p>〔又訊〕中國敎育學會中等敎育研究委員會，業於十二日圓滿閉幕。該委員會對於中等敎育之各項問題，除有詳細書面報吿登載中國敎育學會會務通訊第四期並作更進一步之研究外，特提供改進要點如下：（甲）中學性能問題：（一）中學必須分化，單科中學不能適應靑年個性及社會需要。（二）分化辦法，不宜由敎育行政主管機關作硬性之規定，應由各地中等敎育專家詳加研究與實驗，俟有成果，再公諸社會，以供採行。（乙）中等敎育階段之職業敎育問題：（一）應由政府設法使職業敎育與生產事業密切配合。（二）補習性的職業學校與正規的職業學校應同樣重視。（三）應加强職業指導之實施。（四）關於職業敎育內容之改進，應從課程敎材師資敎法及實習各方面着手。（丙）中學與大學之銜接問題：（一）高中與大學敎員，應彼此取得聯繫。（二）大學入學試題，應切實符合現行中學課程標準。（三）高中應加强升學指導，大學應實行新生入學指導。（丁）改進中等敎育師資素質問題：（一）現行高級師範敎育制度，須作有計劃之改進。（二）關於解決師荒問題，應從提高待遇，安定生活，及保障工作着手。（三）對於在職教師之進修，應多方較勵，高等敎育機構尤其師範學院，展開放進修機會，敎育行政機關應自行設決並與國際文化機構嚴洽，實行出國進修。（戊）中學生生活訓練問題：（一）積極提倡中學敎師之優良士風。（二）導師制，必須加强規模較大之中學，得兼用常務導師制。（三）切實增進靑年之健康生活。（四）重視靑年情緒生活及社會行爲之正常發展。（五）加强實施有系統之課外作業，以培養靑年之優良品性。（己）加强省市中等敎育行政效率問題：（一）政策不宜輕易變動。（二）確立合理之人事制度並切實實施（包括選聘任期待遇進修等）。（三）簡化行政程序。（四）行政當局對於所屬學校，應多作積極之輔導，少作消極之限制。</p>
<h3>教育學會　歡迎立委</h3>
<p>〔本報南京訊〕中國敎育學會南京分會，日前在京四牌樓中大校友會所舉行第六次會員大會，歡迎當選本屆立法委員會員，歡送程其保會員出席國際敎育會議及講學考察，到立委會員胡庶華，程天放，李蒸，程其保，黃麟書，相菊潭，倪文亞，陳際唐，孟雲橋，黃建中，及會員主慕尊，顧一樵，趙迺博，章柳泉，王鏡淸，陳東原，劉季洪，胡家健等六十餘人。主席羅廷光，先致歡迎辭。繼由程時煃，袁伯樵，報吿總會近况，旋各立委相繼發言。</p>
<p>胡庶華發言　胡庶華稱：渠辦敎育已十餘年，深感必須政治經濟相配合，敎育才有辦法，因此到立法院來，並提出當前敎育之兩問題討論：（一）今日敎育有一矛盾現象，考生人數衆多，而錄取者少，因此說者謂大學太少，但就國家敎育經費及師資缺乏情形看來，大學實又太多，此問題應如何解決？重質抑重量：渠主張重質，充實已有之大學設備再說。（二）學生之出路問題：政府無法替畢業生覓致職業，不如將中學多辦師範及職業學校，可保證學生之出路。</p>
<p>程天放發言　程天放發言，盼教育學會與立委多多保持聯繫，立委爲人民之代表，立法院自應反映民意，過去各級民意機關均與人民脫節，而英美議員則常與人民保持接觸，選民中當有與議員通信，請議員在議會中提出各種法案者，議員只有服從中國人民，大部份因敎育程度太低，不關心國事，因此更加重智識份子之責任，今後立法院必須與智識階級取得聯繫，敎育界同人尤爲智識份子之中堅，盼經常通訊，對各項問題之見解，均歡迎提出。其次，敎育界同人在目前時局之下，有一重大使命，因現在政治腐敗，財政混亂，不免養成悲觀失望心理，囂張煩悶的情緒跟蹤而來，人人投機短視，只顧自身利益，不重視國家危難，此現象需要敎育工作人員之糾正，吾人旣從事教育工作，當然不畏困難，相信必能完成使命。</p>
<p>李雲亭發言　李雲亭謂：立法院即將審查下半年度預算，文化敎育委員會中有立委百餘八參加，佔全立委六分之一，都下最大決心，要將敎育經費照憲法規定百分之十五比例兌現，盼敎育學會提供需要之參攷材料以備力爭；其次敎育工作者應設法保持學生之純潔精神，不爲社會所同化，如現在之貪官汚史，二·三十年前亦純潔之學生，此輩即將死去，已不足恐懼，願後者一代比一代更佳。</p>
<p>其他立委孟雲橋·倪文亞·相菊潭·黃建中等相繼被邀發言，程其保報吿，渠定十日在滬起程，先到巴黎聯敎組織，盤桓兩週，取得工作上之聯繫，會後並赴英美考察敎育，約三月後歸國。繼由顧一樵發表關於敎育經費之意見。最後由趙酒傳對各人言論，加以綜結，歷數小時，賓主盡歡而散。</p>

<p>市長杯足球決賽糾紛（上）警察保護裁判員蔣吟僧離塲（下）比賽緊張一幕（中國社攝）</p>
<h3>打裁判惡習難改　市長杯又起糾紛　青白保持冠軍　二比一勝東華</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕三屆市長盃足球決戰，久而不決，昨日午後四時，才行決賽，東靑兩雄，再度相逢，逸園塲上觀衆約八千餘人，鏖戰結果，靑白以二比一小勝，保持市長盃冠軍。開賽十五分鐘後，大雨傾盆，觀衆球員，雨中兀立，勇氣可嘉。惜乎賽至下半時廿五分鐘時，爽華以一比二屈居下風，果然，不出裁判會所料，又發生毆辱裁判員怪劇，東華韓尼波猛摑裁判蔣吟僧，球塲大亂蕩比賽中止，後經沈回春客串繼續執行裁判，比賽得以終塲。運動道德，，然無存，深堪痛惜。</p>
<p>東華得中　先聲奪人　四時零四分開賽，裁判蔣吟僧，巡邊陸順德李國義。靑白攻勝於守，前鋒小將，銳利異常，東華雖多老將，忙於應付，是爲昨賽勝負之分歧點。後起之秀，前途有望。靑白上塲五分鐘內，攻勢猛烈，未有成就。七分鐘時，韓尼波邊傳，陳明哲帶球猛衝，張仁義竟吿失足。明哲力射，秦必高以爲出界，但球觸門柱彈入。東華一比零先聲奪人。</p>
<p>大雨傾盆　各一平手　此時大雨驟下，觀衆羣趨看合上，球員則冒雨作戰，但皮球淋濕奇重，地又潭滑，此起彼仆，比賽减去精彩不少，廿二分鐘金祿生傳小羅，帶球直至門前，林根踢成角球，金開角球，小顧一頂斜出，靑白五鋒前進，小高近門射入，陳惠民接住又漏下，小高如飛而至，一衝入網，扳成和局。此球之進，東華羣情憤慨，以爲小高業已越位，當塲向裁判提抗議。上半時一對一吿終。</p>
<p>青白佔先　演出火爆　下半時於洽興退休，金川瀚入代，互有攻守，相持十五分，幼良犯規，小費卅碼外主罰任意球，直射網窩，陳惠民琵琶彈定，接而復失，二比一反居下風，市華連失兩城，心有未甘，情緒緊張，犯規纍纍，雙方有火爆演出。</p>
<p>毆打裁判　又演怪劇　廿五分鐘，小顧與陳家萬互撞，蔣吟僧判罰東華，韓尼波上前責問，並猛摑裁判，引起糾紛，球賽因之中止，後經關係方面調解，蔣吟僧下野，沈回春以足委會幹事身份，客串執法，繼續比賽，但經此變故。雙方無心應戰，銀笛長鳴，東華以一比二受挫，東華以未屆法定時間，遽而停戰，擬再提抗議云。</p>

<h3>足球會發表聲明　稱東華自願棄權</h3>
<p>本市足球委員會爲昨日東華對靑白之市長杯足球決賽，發生糾紛事，發表聲明如下：</p>
<p>「十三日東華對靑白市長盃足球決賽，下半時東華隊員韓尼波不遵裁判員蔣吟僧之判決，當塲毆打裁判，即被判罰離塲，旋由該隊隊長向裁判負聲明，該賽東華隊自願棄權，惟爲應付當時情勢起見，剩餘比賽時間，由本會職員沈回春擔任裁判，繼續作非正式比賽，以至終塲」。</p>
<h3>東華來函　表示抗議</h3>
<p>「敬啓者，本月十三日本隊與靑白隊之市長盃決賽，因裁判於靑白隊進第一球時，措置失當，當時本隊在塲隊長李垚，即對裁判員提出抗議，經栽判員允許保留抗議權，查當日在塲所引起之糾紛，塲外大都觀眾容有未明眞相，茲將當時引起爭執之事實數點，列舉如下：</p>
<p>（一）靑白踢進之第一球，當時高秀淸君及顧以撒君，早已越位於先，裁判員蔣吟僧立即指爲越位，但巡邊陸順德向裁判員指爲應算進球，裁判忽將錯就錯，臨時改判爲「進球」，當下在塲隊長李垚，即向裁判提出抗議，因裁判員已先判為越位，不應再臨時改變，裁判員亦允許爲本隊保留抗議權，然後繼續比賽。</p>
<p>（二）下半時青白隊顧以撒撞陳家萬，裁判反判陳犯規，當下本隊韓尼波上前向裁判解釋，裁判蔣吟僧以英語口出汚言，辱駡韓尼波，韓君以足球比賽從無裁判員以汚言駡球員者，因之引起糾紛。</p>
<p>（二）裁判員不願執行而離塲，本隊因抗議權業經裁判允許保留，故靜待裁判之得到調解而能上塲執行職務後，卒由沈回春君代爲擔任，沈君並謂「蔣吟僧不願擔任裁判，再由本人繼續，完全爲免觀衆鬧事」。東華對一塲比賽二個裁判，當亦可提出抗議。</p>
<p>當沈回春君執行裁判時，在五時廿五分，但賽至五時卅五分竟即鳴笛終塲，當下本隊在塲隊長李垚，即向沈回春君詢問踢了多少時候，沈君答曰現在五時三十五分。查下半時爲五時正開始，即使迎糾紛爭執所消耗之時間亦算進，至少須至五時四十五分結束，凡未滿法定時間之比賽結果，自不能作爲正式的比數，爲此本隊除已向足球委員會提川抗議外，並將當時情形詳述如上，即請貴報惠予露佈爲荷。東華足球會敬啓。」</p>

<h3>超音波的新用途</h3>
<p>— 强華</p>
<p>音波的振動，若超過了每秒一萬六千次以上，就非人類的耳朶所能聽到；可是今日世界科學的進步已使人類可以製造振動率可達每秒一千二百萬次的超音波，而且工業上，農業上，軍事上，醫學上，氣象學上，乃至日常生活的應用方面，正在試騐利用着這種人類所不能耳聞的超音波，來作種種新的應用。</p>
<p>我們知道：現代工業上對於大件翻砂製品內舒結構的檢查，還缺少切實有效而凡經濟的辦法，可是現在已能應用振動率在每秒百萬次以上的音波以鑑定大件鑄金屬內藏的瑕疵。密契根大學的佛羅德。佛立斯頓敎授（Dr．Floyd　Firestone）發現，一塊完美無缺的金屬鑄品，當用超音波來透視時，在這塊金屬的對面就有一個回聲，這回聲有辦法收聽甚至放大。可是假使這塊金屬鑄件內部有了毛病，在其暇疵之處回聲最速。於是從回聲的快慢可以測定其內部瑕疵之所在。用這個辦法，可檢騐厚達十呎以上的大件鑄品，今日美國很冬著名大廠已普遍採用此法，以檢騐軍艦或輪船推進機軸以及火車機車鋼軸等品質之優劣。</p>
<p>用熱力來消毒牛奶，約需半個鐘頭。加利福尼亞州大學的病菌學家賽勒博士（Dr．A．J．Salle）證明，高頻率的聲音，能够在幾秒鐘內完成牛奶的消毒工作。現在有許多牛奶棚，使用超昔波的方法來同化牛奶，和殺滅牛奶中的病菌。牛奶流過發出超音振動的鋼隔板時，脂肪分裂成較小的球形，結果在胃部中，牛乳凝結的塊狀也比較小，所以容易消化。醫生們認爲這種同化過的牛奶，更適於嬰兒飲用。</p>
<p>食物消毒是一羣先驅聲學工程師們的重大目標之一。在實騐室中的試騐，音波將每立方公分牛奶中的病菌，减低到八個；事實上每立方公分牛奶中的病菌，如不超過三萬個，已符合消毒牛奶最高等的純潔標準。音波將牛奶中的病菌，差不多消滅凈盡，可以使牛奶多儲藏數天，而不致腐壞。</p>
<p>調製蛋黃醬，花生醬，面霜，染料和藥品，也曾藉用音彼的力量，使調製勻和，持久。將來廚房中所用的調和器，祗要擊一個F音鍵，就可以做出一個沒有粗粒的格子蛋糕。</p>
<p>美國麻省劍橋超音波研究協會與美國海軍當局正在計劃消除航空港上空的霧：用音波來使它變成爲雨。在劍橋的實驗室裏有一隻大玻璃缸中，充滿了人造霧，高頻率的音波，在一秒鐘內，就將它消除。不久以前，加利福尼亞州的阿卡塔（Arcata）作戶外實驗，因風勢太猛，把霧吹散，超昔波沒有來得及發揮作用，現在正在製造一架較大超音彼發音機，作更進一步的試驗。</p>
<p>據說蘇聯的科學家以超音波擊動植物的種予，使產量大增。克萊斯特研究實臉工廠的華德（S．L．Ward）研究的結果，發覺以超音波處理過的馬鈴薯較未處理者要早開花一星期，產量亦增加了百分之四十至五十。處理後的豌豆亦較早出芽，且有些產量較普通的加增三倍之多。</p>
<p>華儡將研究的設備交給坎那克提卡特大學的植物學家雷蒙·華萊斯博士（Dr．Raymond　H．Wallace），作進一步的實驗。在過去兩年中，華萊斯博土研究的結果極好，將來對於世界食糧的增產，必定可以有極大的裨益。</p>
<p>英國科學工業研究部主任阿潑里頓爵士（Sir　Edward　Appleton）正在研究用超音波振動衣服上的汚穢，使流入肥皂水中，芝加哥發明家則巳將他所發明的音波眞空淸潔器呈請專利。此器可使地毯起共嗚振動，迫使灰塵自然落下，起洗滌作用。</p>
<p>美國超音彼研究協會造了一具强力的發音機，它的振動，從人耳朶所能聽得見的次數起，直到每秒鐘振動二十萬次，在數百呎以外的地方，都能感覺到它的力量。站在它的威力圈內，你感不到空氣的彼動，但是，你可能感到一種「大難將至」的感覺，而可能感到患有患病的感覺。</p>
<p>在一家大的製造碳黑的工廠裏，在烟囱內裝了一隻特種發音器。音波的振動使碳粒互相擊撞，而結成像雪球似的落下來。因此，不致使碳粒飛到外面去而浪費掉。這種器械亦裝在化學工廠裏以保持氣味而不致使鄕野受害。美國鑄務局已在研究用它來减少都市中烟粒所引起的損害。</p>
<p>酒類的變陳是因爲酒中某種分子互相擊撞的緣故，而超音波可以增加擊撞的次數。去年冬季，超音波研究協會對新釀成的法國酒，試以幾分鐘超音波的振動，其味竟如上等的。陳年威士忌一樣。化學分析的結果，證明它和放了四年的陳酒相同。</p>
<p>科學家已經正在想像用超音波以殺人或使人殘廢。此次大戰中，在奧地利的羅佛（Lofer）城中，曾搜出是項超音波試騐殺人的紀錄：在汽笛般的金屬管中，以氣體有規律地射發出爲人所耳聞的音波，經過大的拋物綫式反射器，然後再匯聚焦點於目標之上。雖然實際戰塲上的運用尚未經試騐，但據估計，川此法在六十公尺以內可在三十秒至四十秒之間將人致死，或者在三百公尺以內可使殘廢。軍事權威都相當在未來的世界戰爭中，用音波殺人將是恐怖武器之一。</p>
<p>醫學的研究家也在利用超音波。哥倫比亞大學神經系的約翰。林和潘奈門兩博士（Drs．John　G．Lyon　and　Tracy．J．Patnam），曾經以超音波來對卅七隻貓，狗和猴子施用用腦部手術，而不用擊開頭蓋骨。施行的方法是把每秒鐘振動八十萬次的音波用一個彎曲的結晶反射體反射到某一個光點上。科學家們發現它們能暫時地激動或者摧毁某一個某選定的腦部紐織中的一點。這件工作仍在實騐階段，但將來可能產生一種不用開刀的腦手術。</p>
<p>超音波學還是一種極新的科學，它未來的發展是不可限量的。科學家現在僅僅路到這片新領域的邊緣，他們必將繼續辛勤地，開闢這片廣大的新土地，爲人類造福。</p>
<h3>新的科學兵器</h3>
<p>— 良</p>
<p>海水電池</p>
<p>在第二次大戰中，海水電池也可說是重要發明之一，此種電池是藉海水而發電。此電池是放在一小型浮標中，當需要時，祗要拉出榜形天綫後，擲入海中，於是立即發出自動無綫電波，在五十海浬半徑以內，可測出此電波，因爲當此電池一入海水中，就開始作用，藉振動器之助，能產生三百三十伏特之電壓，不斷的播出無綫電信號，達十二小時之久。</p>
<p>在第二次大戰中，有許多航空員因飛機損傷而降落在海面上，多藉用此器而得救。</p>
<p>無綫電引導飛彈</p>
<p>現在可以預料到：將來轟炸機之飛行高度，必在高射砲射程之外，所以欲用高射砲火去射擊高空之飛機，實不可能。若是用驅逐機去攻擊成羣結隊的轟炸機，也有許多困難，因爲鍋隊的轟炸機，必是有嚴密的保護，互相防備外來的攻擊，使攻擊的飛機難以乘隙而入，所以爲了解決此項問題，美國愛鮑蒂兵器實驗研究所中的許多科學家和兵器專家，就計劃一種用無綫電引擎的拋射武器，裝載强力炸藥，突入敵方機羣中，而突然猛力爆炸，予敵方嚴重的損害</p>
<p>如敵方機羣恐懼此項銳利的武器，必將分散隊伍，各自飛行，但此時這批機羣正是驅逐機的良好目標，因爲此時驅逐機可順利攻擊敵機了。（未完）</p>
<h3>毛面人</h3>
<p>— 重煕</p>
<p>讀本月七日本報第二頁「今古奇觀」畫題中有「山東武城人李寶珊，滿臉長毛，鬢眉不辨……」云云，頗感興趣。關於此毛面人李君之事實，筆者遠在十餘年前，即不斷採訪，計在靑島獲得李君半身中裝照片（如左圖），並曾根據所得資料，作成一短篇英文論文，在德國人種學雜誌（Zeitschrift　fur　Rassenkunde）一九三七年，六卷二期發表，頗引起人類學家之注意。後來由北平燕京大學友人星兆鈞先生之助，獲得李君全身照及其父母照片，星先生與與君生長同村，兒時朋友，知其事甚詳，李君父母爲鄕村農人，以賣豆腐爲生，生有李君兄弟多人體熊均正常無特異處，惟李君生下即滿身被毛，頭面尤多，至成年後亦不减退。李君在兒童時期，極爲活潑，聰明，以家貧未能讀書，以身生異毛，家庭認爲不祥，同輩常加戯謔，然正賴有此異毛，一生衣食無憂。二十八年來滬表演，住在浙江路永安公司高樓對過某旅館。後於三十一年赴美，加入某馬戯班，單獨表演，所入甚豐。翌年赴南洋表演，乘克扶蘭總統號道出滬上，因不欲外界窺破，在船上均帶面罩，然終被當時大陸報記者探出，有一篇訪問記載於該報，筆者在「科學畫報」亦詳述其事。時隔多年，不知李現在何處。據星先生函吿李君名寶樹，係北平附近人，與少飛先生「今古奇觀」上所述略異，不知孰是，留待改正。自筆者英文論文發表後，英國人類遺傳學名家格茲敎授（Prof．R．R．Gates，F．R．S．）在近著「人類遺傳學（Humon．Genetecs，Vols．2　1947）上曾加引證，謂此類實例極少，須二萬萬胎生產中，方可遇一個，而能長養成年者尤少，現今世界記錄，就科學研究所得，有俄國狗面人，緬甸毛面人家庭及一黑毛面女子而已。人在胎期之內，有一時期遍體生毛，過期則减退，故人出生後，體毛不顯。如李君之滿身生毛，大約係由於體內某內分泌腺失調所致，不能認爲係反祖性之重演。有謂爲猿猴之變種，尤屬無稽矣。</p>
<h3>關於催化作用</h3>
<p>— 克志</p>
<p>只要稍稍懂得科學的人，定會知道催化作用的，所謂催化作用，就是在使兩樣東西發生化學作用時，如果兩樣東西不易發生變化，或是變化得很慢，這時我把加上第三樣東西，就可以使變化速度加快，猶種作用又稱爲觸媒作用。這第三樣東西名爲催化劑，又名觸媒。很奇怪的是催化劑的本身，在促進變化時，絲毫不生任何變化，這眞是科學上的奇蹟！</p>
<p>現在舉一個例子來說明催化作用。例如過氧化氫（雙氧水）極易分解爲水及氧氣，即使在室內溫度亦然，如遇光或加入二氧化錳（Manganese　aioxide），或加入鉑（platinum）之細微粉末，則分解更速，加入二氧化錳鉑之粉末使作用更速之變化，即稱爲觸媒作用，而二氧化錳或鉑之粉末即稱爲觸媒，但加入之二氧化錳或鉑之粉末却不發生變化。</p>
<p>市上所售的過氧化氫中，都放一些少量有機化合物，以阻止過氧化氣的分解，因我們需要的是過氧化氫，我們並不需要水或氧，因此才用有機化合物來阻止牠變化。然則我們稱這種種機化合物爲什麼呢？說牠是觸媒，可是觸媒是使變化速度增加的，我們另外給牠一個名詞，就是負觸媒。由觸媒的意義，可以推知負觸媒的意義，就是觸媒能的使變化速度减低的，都稱爲負觸媒。</p>
<p>催化作用（觸媒作用）的應用很廣，尤其在化學變化中，幾乎都應用到催化作用。可燃氣體混合了氧或空氣遇到一點小火可以闖出大禍。如煤礦的爆炸，即因爲有沼氣（一炭燒（CH4）從煤中慢慢的洩漏出來，到空氣中成爲遇火即行爆炸的混合物。氣氣和氧氣混合，放在黑暗的地方，可以永久不生變化；但略見光就慢慢的化合成鹽酸，若是放在日光中，就立刻發生爆炸。</p>
<p>又如盛木醉（即酒精）的瓶口上放一條白金絲，醇氣就會靠白金的催化作用與空氣中的氧化合，同時白金絲就熱到發紅。同樣的在氧氣發出的瓶口，如果有白金鬆在上面，氧氣就會燃燒起來。學過化學的人都知道氯酸鉀受熱後會放出氧氣，但是常須加入一些二氧化錳，使變化進行更快些。再如亞硫酸鈉有極少量的銅化合物的存在，就很易氧化成硫酸鈉。</p>
<p>催化作用在工業上的應用，很爲布要。用接觸法製硫酸，用氮氣和氧氣市接合成氨氣，從氨製成硝酸和硝酸鹽，都是靠催化作用而成的。如加入亞麻仁油於油漆中，則油漆易乾燥，此並非亞麻仁油之蒸發，而是亞麻仁油易與氮化合的結果。如用氧化鉛爲觸媒而製成爲熟油，則容易乾燥而且很快。從電石製出的乙炔氣C2H2通入水中，如水中有硫酸和硫酸汞的存在，就和氮氧變成乙醛。這是一種很重要的東西，由此可以造出醋酸和醋酸酮（阿西通）。液體乙醛中加醋酸錳，通入氧氣，就得醋酸，如果沒有醋酸錳的存在，就大有危險，因爲有一種過醋酸是猛烈的爆炸物。醋酸錳可以防止這種醋酸的產生而自身始終不變，所以這裏的醋酸錳就是前面所說的負觸媒了。</p>
<p>催化作用在動植牧方面的化學作用亦爲需要，如番薯的產生，糖萊菔的生糖，菜蔬的綠葉色，紫羅蘭的有紫色，都是由於有酵素做催化劑的。動物體中的消化，人身的神經和肌肉的作用都是由於催化劑主持其事的。小至螢火的發光也是酵素的催化作用。</p>
<p>自然界中有兩個很普通的催化劑，第一是空氣中的氧氣，因爲宇宙間的任何地方都有空氣，所以氧的催化作用常是不易覺察的，作用自然而然的進行，似乎與空氣無關，如在眞空中或在別種氣體如氧替代了空氣時進行的變化，才能發覺這種關係。還有一個很普通的催化劑就是水。有人早知道十分乾燥的一氧化炭和氧雖因電火花的影響也不能化合，祗要有很微的濕氣就立即變成二氧化灰。鈉與氧是最容易化合的，但是在乾燥的情形中可以加熱到融化而不起變化。又如乾的氨和乾的氯化氣不會化合成爲氯化銨，祗要有了濕氣就立即發生作用。但是實際的情形，並不是缺少水氣就絕對不起作用，譬如一氧化炭和氧乾燥的時候，要用加强的電花或增加氣壓才發生效力。</p>
<p>此外還有一件奇特的事情，就是除加一種觸媒外，再加另一種觸媒，則變化可以更快。如用氯酸鉀加熱分解時，加入二氧化錳已可使變化加更快，但如更加入氧化鐵，則變化的速度更快。又如在合成氨時，用氧化鋁爲觸媒，再加入氧化鉀，則可增進氧化鋁之觸媒效能。我們稱這種氧化鐵和氧化鉀爲助媒劑（Promoter），意思就是觸媒的觸媒。</p>
<p>應用催化作用的目的，是在帮肋進行困難的化學變化。但是觸媒之如何能够增加或减低變化的速度，至今還是一個謎，雖經精密的研究，而其實在情形尚是奧秘不明。如在用氯酸鉀製氧時，加入的二氧化錳實在說不出這一點二氧化錳究有什麽作用。</p>
<p>總之，催化作用無論對於工業上或科學上都有極其重要的關係，假使沒有發現這催化作用，人類的享用也未必有今日之情形吧。如果有一天窺知催化作用的玄奧秘密，將來的應用一定更會廣大，且看誰揭開這秘密！</p>

<h3>為富不仁</h3>
<p>— 靖文</p>
<p>報載救濟特捐自吳市長率先示範慨捐五億元以來（這筆款子據說是市長太太在馬尼拉畫展售款所得），迄無繼起解囊者，因此急煞了幾位委員，而也有人譏諷說，足證上海並無富戶，所謂豪門資本云云，大概也是好事者捕風捉影之談了。</p>
<p>關於中國有無富翁的問題，原可見仁見智，憑各人的立塲而異其見解。例如最近立法院中反對開徵財產稅的人，就乾脆認爲一中國無巨富，而獻身爲國努力者，遭此打擊（指財產稅——筆者），實非合理」；更有舉出大道理者，則謂「人民對國家應有之各項納稅義務，早經切實執行，今復加以額外課徵，實近於沒收財產而摧毁民生。」</p>
<p>一個是不承認中國有巨富，一個則認爲即使有巨富，也因早經對各項納稅義務切實執行了，自不能再接受「近於沒收財產而摧毁民生」的「額外課徵」。</p>
<p>中國沒有巨富而祗有大貧小貧之分，這是三民主義中早就說過了的。然而富與窮，本是相對的現象。中國雖然還沒有產生如美國六十家族那樣系統整然的豪富，但財富集中於少數人的現象，則恐誰也不能否認。中山先生所說的大貧小貧，其間的距離自經「國難財」與「勝利財」的兩個階段後，是愈隔愈遠了。和美國比較，中國雖然仍舊是大貧小貧，但以國內社會的本身現象言，則大貧小貧之間，已經顯出了很明白的對照。</p>
<p>中國是有富人的，據歷次國內外有關方面的非正式估計，少數「高等華人」存在美國的私產，即達四億美圓左有，也就等於這次美援的全數。四億美圓在美國也許僅是滄海一粟，但如果肯拿出來貢獻於國家，則一定能發揮安定社會經濟的效果。試想我們這次費儿牛二虎之力，要人們在華府飛來飛去，所得也不過此數，而且還要看盡人家的嘴臉！</p>
<p>再拿社會現象說，大小富戶更不在少數。現在的救濟特捐雖無人響應，然而試問過去選舉所謂「上海小姐一時」擲千金的又是那一輩人？現在過着荒淫無恥生活的，又是那一輩人！最近不是有位太太願斥資造廟供奉跑馬廳旁的一對石頭人嗎？爲甚麽就不肯拿些錢出來救濟窮人，帮助國家？</p>
<p>爲富不仁，早有定論，而且是古今中外一律！聖經上曾說富人進大國比駱駝穿針猶難，以及莎士比亞筆下的威尼斯商人之類，都非僅爲挖苦之詞，而是人生實在經驗之談。北平最近也因特捐無人解囊，致使何思源市長慨嘆，說向富人要錢，無異與虎謀皮。北平一部份激昂之士主張組織學生，到富戶家門口去歌唱「你，你，你，你這老守財奴！」甚有主張將傷兵難民遷到富戶家中去的。這些雖然都不可取法，但也足見人心是怎樣憤慨了。不過，富人倒也並不是完全不肯化錢，如果再來一套「上海小姐」或其他足以滿足色情狂的玩意兒，準有一輩孝子順孫乖乖的前去輸將。上海就多的是「過房爺」與「舞塲孝子」之類。再不然，就得利用和尚尼姑之類。富人們大多都是「善男信女」，造橋修路等公益事雖然攤派不到他們身上，但如果是造廟裝佛，他們準肯踴躍解囊。富人的銀箱上祗有有兩把鑰匙，一把是色，一把便是佛。雖然我佛如來提倡色即是空，但在情慾與自私的交織下　構　了我們富人的性格。</p>
<p>但我們對此種現象不用悲觀，更談不到有關世道人心或民族沉淪等大題目。一個國家總有少數的殘渣，一個民族總不免有少數敗類。愛國心與民族氣格是決不能從這少數殘渣敗類身上去找的。道義與輿論制裁的方法，恐也很少能喚起這輩人的理智。俗語所謂財迷心竅，便是指的這種人。他們旣已迷了心竅，還能對他們指望甚麼呢？套用阿Q式的口氣：一讓他們把偌大的財產帶到棺材裏去吧！」</p>
<p>如果政府當眞有令富人出錢的勇氣，則就乾脆實施財產徵用，無需用特捐名義。事實己擺在眼前，要有錢人自願解囊是辦不到的事。如果實施財產徵用，一定能一新社會風氣；政治革新，亦必隨之俱來矣。</p>

<h3>聊齋原稿</h3>
<p>— 衛人</p>
<p>聊齋志異原稿，僞滿時期在東北發現，藏於作者十世孫蒲文珊手，漢奸袁金鎧曾選印二十四則，內十五則爲梓行本譌誤脫落較多者，九則爲今本所無者·惜銅版印刷，雖存眞跡，轉印即難。東北頻年變亂，蒲氏流落何所，己難查考。袁印本並未公開發行，想流傳極希，因轉錄「吳門畫工」一則，以供世人。</p>
<p>「吳門畫工某，忘其名，喜繪呂祖，每想像而神會之，希幸一遇，虔結在念，靡刻不存。一日値羣丐欽郊郭間，內一人敝衣露肘而神采軒豁。心忽動，疑爲呂祖。諦視，覺愈確，遽捉其臂，日：君呂祖也。丐者大笑。某堅執爲是，伏拜不起。丐者曰：我即呂祖，汝將奈何？某叩頭，但祈指教。丐者曰：汝能相識，可謂有緣，然此處非語所，夜間當再相見也。再欲遮問，轉盼已杳，駭嘆而歸。至夜，果夢呂祖來曰：念子志慮專凝，特來一見，但骨氣貪吝，不能爲仙，我使子見一人可也。即向空一招，遂有一麗人躡空而下，服裝如貴嬪，容光　儀，煥映一室。呂祖曰：此乃董娘娘，子審誌之。旣而又問記得否？答已記之。又日：勿忘却！俄而麗者去，呂祖亦去。醒而異之，即夢中所見，肖而藏之，終亦不解所謂。後數年，偶遊於都，會董妃薨，上　其賢，將爲肖像，諸工　集，口授心擬，終不能似。某忽觸念：夢中人得無是耶？即以圖呈進，宮中傳覽，皆謂神肖。由是授官中書，辭不受，賜萬金，於是名大譟。貴戚家爭遺重幣，乞爲先人傳影，但懸空摹寫，罔不曲似。浹辰之間，累數巨萬。萊蕪朱拱奎曾見其人。」</p>

<h3>翁仲</h3>
<p>— 翼雲</p>
<p>跑馬廳前面的石翁仲，現更愈變愈奇了，竟有人上書警局，請求自費建廟，遷往供奉，並尊翁仲爲佛，（見九日本報）此翁仲何幸，居然一升而上西天，成佛作祖，眞是滑天下之大稽</p>
<p>考翁仲之由來，係因秦時有阮翁仲其人，身長一丈三尺，甚爲勇猛，秦始皇時，將兵駐守臨洮，奴匃甚爲畏懼，及其死後，始皇乃以銅質墓鑄其像，置於咸陽宮外，後人遂認銅像及石像，皆爲翁仲。又「幼學瓊林」一書，有「墓前石人，原爲翁仲」一語，故今人多認翁仲爲墓前石人之專稱。實則墓前石人，不必盡爲翁仲，如唐書邱行恭傳，謂唐太宗以石斵行恭之像與馬，立昭陵前，以旌其救護之功，是昭陵節的石人爲邱行恭，並非翁仲，更觀各地陵墓，其石人形狀不一，有文有武，有老（有鬚）有少（無鬚），自不得概以翁仲名之。</p>
<p>大抵石人石馬，除如秦始皇唐太宗之專爲功臣鑄像外，其餘不過爲墓前之飾品，亦猶殉葬之俑，儘可任意造作何種人物或動物，固不必拘定某像即爲某人或爲某名也。惟在愚夫愚婦心目中，旣不知此石人的來歷，亦不知翁仲係何等人，但見石像莊嚴，便認之爲天神爲佛祖，磕頭如搗蒜，燒香似束薪，這種愚不可及之態，本極可笑，但上書請遷移建廟者，是否純係上述之迷信，尚禾敢遽斷：上海一隅，借善薩歛財的人甚多，或者見翁仲之足資號召，欲趁此機，將翁仲移爲己有，以爲發財之工具，亦未可知！若係此種「神道投機家」，如准其所請，其作祟當比在跑馬廳前尤烈。總之，此翁仲不毁滅，其作祟將不止，根本解決，惟有將他擊碎，則後患永除，未知當道以爲如何？</p>

<h3>Speakers of Hubei Province and Wuhan City Councils Issue Joint Telegram to President, Urging Bai Chongxi and Cheng Qian to Return to Wuhan Promptly</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Hankou, 13th Dispatch] He Chengjun and Zhang Michuan, speakers of the Hubei Province and Wuhan City Councils, recently sent a joint telegram to President Chiang Kai-shek and Minister He Yingqin, urging them to promptly urge Bai Chongxi and Cheng Qian to return to Wuhan to preside over the two major tasks of suppressing bandits and pacifying the people in central China. The telegram stated in brief: "Recently, the treacherous bandits have been causing disturbances in northern Hunan and central Hubei. Xiangfan is under urgent threat, Jingzhou and Shashi are on the verge of danger, and counties such as Hankou, Chuan, Mian, Yang, Jing, Shan, and Qianjiang have fallen one after another. Military suppression and political pacification are equally important. Currently, Commander-in-Chief Bai and Director Cheng are still staying in Nanjing and Shanghai, and both major tasks are felt to be without anyone in charge. The public is extremely apprehensive, and it is extremely worrying. If the bandits cross the Yangtze River, it will not only shake Nanjing but also shake the foundation of the nation. Director Cheng has been stationed in Wuhan for many years, defending the capital, and his contribution has been great. We earnestly request that he be urged to return to Wuhan as soon as possible to preside over the work of pacifying central China." According to reports, since Bai and Cheng humbly declined their new posts, there has been much speculation here about future personnel arrangements. The general expectation is that the central government will adapt to actual needs and determine the candidates for suppressing bandits and pacifying central China as soon as possible. Furthermore, Garrison Commander Ruan Qi was summoned to Nanjing by plane on the 13th.</p>
<h3>Rules of Procedure of the Control Yuan to be Discussed at the First Meeting This Morning</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 13th Dispatch] The first plenary session of the first Control Yuan under the Constitution is scheduled to be held at 9 AM on the 14th, presided over by Chairman Yu Youren. The scheduled agenda will include discussion of the rules of procedure for the meeting. The Secretariat of the plenary session has already drafted a draft of the rules of procedure and submitted it to the plenary session as a reference document. Among them, there are provisions for the exercise of the power of supervision and the power of consent. However, the implementing regulations for the Control Law, the Impeachment Law, and the Indictment Law will be drafted separately, and all draft bills will only be implemented after they have been passed by the Legislative Yuan. However, the Control Yuan hopes to complete the formal procedures before the end of June so that the work of this session can be promoted quickly. Furthermore, after the rules of procedure are passed, the task of the plenary session will be to discuss the method of exercising the power of consent. After that, it will be the implementation of the power of consent, consenting to the President's nominations for the presidents of the Judicial and Examination Yuans, as well as the members of the Examination Committee and the Grand Justices. It is also learned that the candidate for Auditor-General of the Control Yuan will also be nominated by the President and consented to by the Legislative Yuan. It is currently learned that this candidate may be Lin Yunhai for reappointment.</p>
<h3>Time Not Ripe for Currency Reform; Government Has Indeed Drafted Several Plans; Implementation of Silver Standard Impossible</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 13th Dispatch] Amid the daily depreciation of currency value, the issue of currency reform has now become one of the most important issues attracting attention nationwide. Since Dong XianGuang's remarks acknowledged that the government already has a plan for currency reform, this statement has become increasingly noisy, and some have even said that it has been decided to implement the silver standard. Over the past few days, the reporter has had interviews with officials and experts, and the comprehensive conclusion obtained is: the government has indeed drafted several currency reform plans, but the time for implementation will depend on when the objective conditions are met. Therefore, the matter is being handled with special caution, waiting for the appropriate time. Bei Zuyi's trip to the United States this time is related to contacting loans for currency reform and carries several plans for currency reform drafted by our country to provide reference for the United States. As for the standard to be adopted during future currency reforms, opinions differ, but the possibility of implementing the silver standard in the rumors is very small, because countries participating in the International Monetary Fund Conference must link their future currency systems with the International Monetary Fund. Therefore, the "International Managed Gold Standard System" is the most likely to be adopted.</p>
<h3>Opinions Differ on Timing and Conditions</h3>
<p>Regarding the timing and conditions of currency reform, the opinions of various experts and parties also differ. Based on the experience of Germany's currency reform, Gu Chunfan advocates that there is no need to wait for inflation to stop, balance revenue and expenditure, or increase industrial and agricultural production before reforming the currency system. Because if we wait for these three conditions to be met, we will not know when currency reform can be implemented. Gu also believes that there are many difficulties in implementing the silver standard. He advocates implementing the gold exchange standard, reforming in stages. First, taxation should be calculated according to indexes, with the national currency as the main currency and the legal tender as the auxiliary currency. When revenue and expenditure are balanced, the national currency will be fully adopted, and the legal tender will be abolished. Zhang Qianhua believes that the source of all chaos lies in the Communist Party. If the Communist bandits cannot be eliminated, currency reform will also be futile. However, if currency reform is carried out, the capital of wealthy families should be used as reserve funds. Liu Butong advocates that currency reform should adopt the gold standard, but the method of unlimited exchange should not be adopted. Domestic peace must be achieved, the vested interests class must be destroyed, and revenue and expenditure must be balanced before currency reform can be carried out. Cao Guoqing and Gu Hegao (both professors at Jinling University) both believe that the current legal tender has been maliciously inflated and should be stopped immediately, or the number of issues should be limited first, and gradually stopped. Professor Wu Feidan pointed out that there is currently a trend of reforming the currency system and implementing the silver standard. However, the silver standard has become an outdated standard system in the world and should not be adopted. He advocates implementing a "new gold exchange standard" system. Someone else pointed out that implementing the silver standard must be the country with the most silver production, but Mexico has now abandoned the silver standard and implemented the gold standard. Jian Guansan believes that although the general public is enthusiastic about currency reform, the objective conditions do not exist. Jian pointed out that relying solely on foreign gold or silver cannot solve China's financial problems. Silver should only be used as subsidiary currency, not as the main currency. Combining various opinions, it is generally believed that the timing of currency reform is not yet ripe, and the silver standard is not a suitable and feasible standard system.</p>
<h3>Presidential Decree Appoints Vice Ministers of Various Departments</h3>
<p>Li Chongshi as Secretary-General of the Control Yuan</p>

<h3>Candidates for Presidents of the Judicial and Examination Yuans to be Nominated by President Within Days; Vice Presidents of the Two Yuans Likely to be Recommended by the Democratic Socialist and Youth Parties</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 13th Dispatch] The presidents and vice presidents of the Judicial and Examination Yuans will soon be nominated to the Control Yuan by the President. There is much speculation outside about the candidates. The reporter has recently learned from reliable sources that President Chiang is carefully considering the candidates and is expected to submit them within three or two days. Among them, Wang Chonghui has been internally designated as the President of the Judicial Yuan, while the President of the Examination Yuan and the two Vice Presidents have not yet been determined. It is rumored that Mo Dehui or Hui Qi will be nominated by the President as the President of the Examination Yuan, but this is not the case. It is heard that the President intends to appoint Mo Dehui as a Senior Advisor to the Presidential Office, so that he can consult his opinions on major national issues at any time. The vice presidents of the two Yuans may be recommended by the Democratic Socialist and Youth Parties, respectively, each serving as the vice president of one Yuan. Furthermore, although the number of members of the previous Examination Yuan was not large, almost all were southerners. Therefore, the President has decided to nominate several candidates from the northeast and northern provinces in the upcoming nomination of Examination Committee members. Candidates for Grand Justices will also be nominated according to this principle to avoid regional bias.</p>

<h3>Legislators' Housing Problem to be Solved by the Yuan</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 13th Dispatch] The Legislative Yuan is now trying to solve the housing problem for legislators in Nanjing. Permanent dormitories have been arranged on Baixia Road, where the Legislative Yuan is preparing to build Houfu Apartments. At the same time, the Yuan has consulted the Executive Yuan to instruct the Nanjing Municipal Government to build more new public housing for government employees and teachers for legislators to rent and reside in. For the current temporary housing problem, the Yuan has rented several houses, which are divided into family dormitories and single dormitories. They will be allocated by lottery to legislators who have come to Nanjing from afar and those who have brought their families from the bandit areas and are still living in hotels. Those who wish to stay in hotels and do not intend to move to the dormitory can have their hotel expenses reviewed and paid by the Yuan, which will be deducted from their future rent subsidies. Those who have their own houses or more comfortable places to stay in Nanjing and do not need dormitories for the time being will be given rent subsidies.</p>
<h3>Zhang Jia'ao Speaks Out</h3>
<p>Denies Relatives Manipulating the Market</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, This City] Recently, a legislator accused Zhang Jiaji, the former Governor of the Central Bank, of presiding over foreign exchange tasks during his tenure, and that his relatives inevitably had the suspicion of taking advantage of opportunities to manipulate the market. Zhang specifically issued the following statement on the 13th: "Jiaao has served the society and the government for more than 30 years, and the society has its own public opinion on his conduct and dealing with people; the recent accusation by a legislator, after investigation, shows that the foreign exchange granted and the exchange rate adjustments during my tenure all had a certain system. All merchants applying to purchase foreign exchange were subject to the strictest and most open review procedures by the Import and Export Control Commission, in accordance with the audit principles, and the names of all permit holders were published monthly. Since August 17 last year, the exchange rate has adopted a dynamic adjustment method, and a new Equalization Fund Committee has been established, with five members appointed by the National Government. The committee and designated bank representatives discuss and decide on the adjustment of the exchange rate every morning. I do not participate in this, and this exchange rate only applies to foreign exchange transactions with permits. I don't know how relatives can take advantage of opportunities to manipulate the market? All the work of the Import and Export Control Commission and the Equalization Fund Committee, I heard, has already been reported to the Yuan. Anyone who understands the actual situation will be able to judge whether it is right or wrong."</p>

<h3>Military and People Cooperate, Strong as Steel; Changchun is Impregnable; Commander Zeng Zesheng Issues Statement</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Shenyang, 13th Dispatch] The focus of the fighting in Changchun is in the southwestern suburbs. The bandits have attacked various fortresses for days, but have not succeeded. Currently, the bandits are collecting ladders and plundering grain to carry out wave-like attacks. A detachment of over a thousand men from the Sixteenth Division of the Bandit's Sixth Column attacked Hongxi Street again on the night of the 12th, and fierce fighting was still ongoing as of noon on the 13th. Over a hundred shells landed in the Changchun city area on the 12th.</p>

The army loves the people, and the people love the army. The embodiment of this great spirit is not accidental. Hundreds of thousands of dear compatriots in Changchun can distinguish right from wrong, understand the advantages and disadvantages, and clearly see the evils of the bandit traitors. What can be comforted to all my compatriots in Changchun is that with the strong strength and firm fighting spirit of our Changchun garrison, coupled with the "fortress group defense line" as strong as steel, it is sufficient to ensure that the city of Changchun is impregnable. Moreover, we rely on our Air Force squadron to always maintain the air supply line for the military and civilians of Changchun, to crush Mao's bandits' plan to blockade and encircle Changchun, and finally achieve the goal of restoring land transportation in Changchun."</p>

<h3>Wedemeyer, Hoffman, et al. Appeal for Military and Economic Aid to China to Prevent the Situation from Becoming More Serious</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper News] New York, 13th Radio: The US Senate Appropriations Committee held a secret meeting on the 13th to discuss the issue of reducing aid to China funds. Hoffman, US Secretary of the Army Royal, Bridges and others attended to testify, advocating the restoration of the original figure of 466.3 million US dollars. General Wedemeyer also attended and told the committee that "if you want to stop communism, both military and economic aid to China are needed." Hoffman also said: "In order to prevent the situation in China from worsening, US aid to China is necessary."</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 12th Dispatch] The Senate Appropriations Committee will take action on the 14th on the House of Representatives' reduction of 63 million US dollars from the aid to China plan and other foreign aid funds.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 12th Dispatch, United Press] General Wedemeyer and Economic Cooperation Administration official Hoffman asked Congress to provide "separate" large-scale military and economic assistance to China. They appealed to Senator Bridges, chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee, as the Senate Appropriations Committee is considering reducing the amount of foreign aid. Gu Weijun, the Chinese ambassador to the United States, was invited to the committee meeting room, but did not speak to the committee. The attendance of a foreign ambassador at a Senate Appropriations Committee is an extraordinary event. Gu told reporters that he had no intention of making a statement before the committee. When asked whether the US government's requested $570 million in aid to China for 15 months would help curb inflation in China, he replied: Any goods supplied to China will ease the pressure of inflation. Bridges said after holding a closed-door meeting that Wedemeyer and Hoffman had strongly stated that the situation in China was critical, and that economic and military aid to China was necessary in order to prevent communism. Bridges also said: Hoffman assured the committee that he would select outstanding and capable people to manage aid to China, while strongly calling for the restoration of the funds recommended by the House to be reduced. Bridges said: A major problem is urgently awaiting resolution. We must maintain our goals in China so that the situation does not become more serious. The House of Representatives has canceled some of the funds earmarked by the Senate for military assistance to China, and stipulated that all aid to China should be handled in the same way as the anti-communism plan implemented in Greece and Turkey.</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Beware of Fire!</h3>
<p>As we enter summer, the climate is extremely hot, and disease and fire have become the two major worries in urban society. To prevent the occurrence and spread of disease, we must emphasize hygiene; to prevent the occurrence and damage of fire, we must emphasize fire prevention, especially for the general public to be consciously aware and beware of fire. After the major fire at the Zhongfa Warehouse on Henan Road on the 5th, another fire broke out on Sichuan Middle Road yesterday morning. Regarding the fire on Henan Road, it has been confirmed that 59 innocent citizens were killed or injured, and nearby shops and newspaper offices were also affected, resulting in particularly heavy losses. Regarding yesterday morning's fire, the casualties and losses are still under investigation. At the same time, the municipal government is also thoroughly investigating the cause of the Zhongfa Warehouse fire from an administrative perspective; the District Procuratorate is investigating the criminal responsibility of the Zhongfa Warehouse from a judicial perspective; and the port authorities are studying the safety of storing flammable materials from a regulatory perspective. These post-incident investigations indicate that no one is taking responsibility administratively or legally, but instead using "thorough investigation," "investigation," and "research" to shirk responsibility, leaving the dead and injured to suffer injustice and the victims with no way to seek compensation. This accidental loss will probably be difficult to redress and provide relief for.</p>
<p>After the major fire on Wuding Road last spring and the burning of the Maochang Company warehouse on Nanxun Road, this newspaper successively issued urgent calls to "Beware of Fire," arousing the attention of the municipal authorities and the general public, hoping that the authorities and the public, based on a sense of caution and fear, would consciously and proactively prepare for fire prevention. Unfortunately, in the past year, fires have increased from time to time, and the lives and property of all residents of the city have been threatened and persecuted by fire. This is the misfortune of Shanghai's urban society. According to the fire statistics released by the city's fire department, the number of fire alarms from January to the end of November last year reached as many as 1,129, and the figures for these eleven months exceeded the records of any previous year. The reasons for this are roughly divided into the following points: (1) The population has increased to five million, with concentrated housing; (2) Poor construction, unchecked electrical wiring, lack of a sense of responsibility among the general public, and a lack of emphasis on the preservation of residential housing; (3) The use of flammable liquids for cooking at home, which is most likely to cause fires; (4) Warehouses are located in urban areas, and chemical and flammable materials are abundant in the warehouses; (5) Unregulated loading and unloading of goods at ports and wharves, and failure to implement safety inspections; (6) The deplorable state of fire-fighting equipment. According to Director Yu Shuping, the major fire at the Zhongfa Warehouse on Henan Road was caused by the smuggling of 20 large barrels of film. This kind of waste film is made of nitrocellulose raw materials, which are extremely flammable. If exposed to the sun or heat, it will produce flammability and cause a serious explosion with a large amount of gas.</p>
<p>From the above analysis, it can be seen that the causes of the past major fires in Shanghai are mostly chemical hazardous materials, and the locations are mostly warehouses. Now, in order to prevent problems before they occur, and to address the root cause, we are willing to reiterate the call to "Beware of Fire," hoping that the municipal authorities will take swift and active measures to prevent fires from an administrative perspective, targeting the causes of past major fires, while also arousing the vigilance and responsibility of all citizens and merchants, turning disasters into blessings and eliminating troubles in the invisible. As for the methods of preventing fires, the technical aspects need to be studied by municipal and fire experts. We only put forward the following points in principle:</p>
<p>First, warehouses in the central and residential areas of Shanghai should be completely moved out. All warehouse inventories should be subject to safety inspections. The Zhongfa Warehouse's storage of dangerous goods violated the "Shanghai Municipal Regulations for the Management of the Transportation of Dangerous Goods," which was a failure of inspection by the police and public utility departments; last year's chemical explosion at the China Merchants Bureau Wharf was a dereliction of duty by the port authorities. At present, there are numerous agencies in Shanghai that regulate warehouses and transportation. On the municipal administrative side, there are the Public Utilities Bureau and the Police Bureau; on the financial administrative side, there are the Jianghai Customs and the Financial Administration Bureau; on the military affairs side, there are the Joint Logistics Headquarters and the Port Headquarters; and on the commercial side, there are the Wharf and Warehouse Liaison Bureau and the Warehouse Trade Association. The administrative system is fragmented and the management methods are difficult to comprehensively address, which is inevitable. In the future, we should seek the unification of management and gradually move public and private warehouses away from urban areas to ensure safety.</p>
<p>Second, since the eight-year war, the electrical materials and equipment in public and private buildings in Shanghai have mostly become outdated. Once exposed to moisture, they are prone to electrical leakage. Therefore, electrical wiring inspections and safety inspections of electrical equipment in companies, firms, and homes should be carried out as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Third, the use of flammable liquids in households should be restricted. Many small and medium-sized families in Shanghai use liquid fuels. Some cause fires during cooking, while others store flammable materials that lead to fires. In particular, the use of kerosene for cooking is more likely to cause fires than gasoline. The municipal authorities should impose reasonable restrictions and bans. In fact, for the sake of the lives and property of the vast majority of citizens, it is necessary to restrict and ban flammable liquids.</p>
<p>Fourth, Shanghai has a dense population, much of which is not needed for the productive sectors. From a socio-economic policy perspective, we should strive to disperse the population on the one hand and restrict the influx of population on the other, to avoid the concentration of the urban population. At present, the most important measures, such as banning mezzanine floors and preventing various buildings that are not conducive to fire prevention, are very necessary.</p>
<p>The above points are only from an administrative perspective; as for the citizens, it is hoped that everyone will establish a sense of responsibility, cultivate an automatic and conscious spirit of self-government, and with a cautious mindset and a fearful life, engage in fire prevention in their actions at all times, so that fires can be prevented before they ignite.</p>
<h3>The Situation in the Liaoxi Corridor</h3>
<p>— Special Correspondent for This Newspaper, Han Qingtao</p>
<p>[Dispatch from Jinzhou, This Newspaper, 10th] Although the situation in Liaoxi, centered on Jinzhou, has not developed much today, it is playing a magnificent role in consolidating the two ports and one line, and undertaking the task of integrating land, sea, and air, to counter the Communist bandits' tactics of "encircling points" and "cutting lines." The so-called two ports are Huludao and Taihuangdao, and the one line is the Beining Road, which connects transportation inside and outside the pass. In addition, the continuous hum of engines in the sky above Jinzhou is precisely the air transport that connects Shenyang with the sea and land inside and outside the pass.</p>
<p>Air transport, although not powerful enough, transports flour, ammunition, and clothing shipped to Jinzhou by sea and rail, one plane at a time, to Shenyang. Shenyang's goods for export, such as bristles and special steel, are also transported to Jinzhou and exported. The 50-minute flight between Jin and Shen, coupled with the long summer days, allows each plane to make more than four round trips. The question is how to maximize its effectiveness.</p>
<p>Next, let's look at the situation of the bandit and national armies in Liaoxi. The main area is the zone from Fuxin in the north to Suizhong in the south. The bandits have deployed a Ninth Column, confronting the national army across the Daling River. On the military map, a large circle is drawn here, indicating that this bandit force occupies and controls a considerable area. The bandit headquarters is in Beizhen, the 25th Division is south of Dahu Mountain, the 26th Division is stationed in Goubangzi, and the 27th Division is in Luyangyi, a key point on the highway between Beizhen and Goubangzi. This large circle, starting from Heishan in the north and ending at the east bank of the Daling River in the south, cuts off and suffocates the flow of pulses and blood between Jinzhou and Shenyang.</p>
<p>Yixian is the northernmost point of the Liaoxi Corridor. The railway line has been destroyed and is closed to traffic. In the area west and east of the railway, on the Junchuan Dihang, seven or eight small circles are drawn west of the railway, which are the four regiments of local bandit forces of the first, second, third, and sixth districts of the bandit 21st Military Region, as well as the "92nd Detachment" and the "Jin-Yi Detachment," etc. In addition, there is a bandit force of more than 3,000 claiming to be the "Third Division." There is a Fourth Regiment east of the railway, and more than 200 mounted bandits, roaming and harassing.</p>
<p>Yixian was originally the point where two railway lines branched out and met. One line going west from there is the Jingu Road from Jinzhou to Chengde or Gubeikou, and the other going northeast from there is the Xinyi Road from Yixian to Xinlitun. Yixian is a stronghold of the national army, while the bandit 21st Military Region is in the Beipiao area.</p>
<p>West of Jinzhou, in the area of Hongluoxian and Bijia Mountain, there are two small circles. In Hongluoxian, it is the "First Regiment of the 18th Military Region" of the bandits, and Bijia Mountain is the "Liaoxi Brigade." Further west, there are two more small circles, one is Gangyaoling, where the command post of the bandit 18th Military Region is located, and the other circle is the area of ​​Shanshen Temple and Boliwa, where the bandits have a Second Regiment.</p>
<p>West of Jinxi, there are two small circles, which are Yangjiazhangzi, which contains abundant chromium ore. The bandit "Jinxi Detachment" occupies that place. The railway from there to Jinxi is already closed. Originally, the Jinxi Cement Plant transported stones from here. Looking further southwest, in the "Jianchang" area west of Xingcheng, the bandit "Xingcheng Detachment" occupies it, and in the "Kuanbang" area west of Suizhong, it is the bandit "Suizhong Detachment."</p>
<p>In the area west of the railway from Jinzhou to Shanhaiguan, the mountains are continuous, which is beneficial to the bandits. Almost every stronghold of the national army has a bandit local detachment facing each other from afar. The east side of the railway, close to the coast, is quite peaceful.</p>
<p>In the area farther west of the railway between Jinxi and Xingcheng, the Bandit Independent Eighth Division, which owns the 22nd, 23rd, and 24th regiments, is located in the area belonging to Jianchang County. There is also a "Mongolian Cavalry Detachment" here. Yaowangmiao, east of Jianchang, is the location of the "18th Military Region Commissioner's Office" and the bandit "Jiandong County Government," and a "Jiandong Detachment" is stationed there. To its west, in Daxi Mountain, there is a small bandit arsenal with 1,800 male workers and 200 female workers, producing more than 1,000 grenades a day, and also making bullets.</p>
<p>Looking at the bandit army in Liaoxi between Fuxin and Suizhong as a whole, the Ninth Column east of the Daling River and the Independent Eighth Division east of Jianchang are both regular field armies of the bandits. Some mounted bandits are also relatively fierce, and the remaining "regiments" with 1,000 people and "detachments" with 500-600 people are local troops. Some people call them local "Eighth Route Army." Counting the regular and local bandits together, there are only 30,000 to 40,000 people. Among them, the local troops lack weapons, ammunition, and combat experience, but the organization and political training are relatively strong.</p>
<p>From Yixian in the east to Qinhuangdao in the west, the national army has a total of four major armies, in addition to temporary divisions, traffic police, and some newly trained troops, plus local teams, the military strength can be called strong.</p>
<p>If the bandits attack the Liaoxi Corridor with more than five columns, the national army in Shenyang will inevitably launch an attack. According to the bandit's operational principle of "not fighting if they can't win," they dare not easily attack fortifications. However, the national army cannot prevent the destruction of transportation. Short-term disruption of transportation is possible, especially when the rainy season comes. The construction of bridges after destruction and the inability to pass under the river again increase the difficulties for the road.</p>
<p>The issue of political cooperation between the military and the people needs to be improved urgently. Many people express dissatisfaction with the army because some troops ask the people for food, trees, meat, chickens, and money. The reporter heard many people say: "Every time the Eighth Route Army comes to cause trouble, the people suffer, as if the people brought the bandits in. Beating and forcing makes the people neither one thing or another. Anyone with a little ability avoids the area and flees in all directions. Those who can't do anything have to endure it. As a result, many local ruffians control the local power and act recklessly." In response to this bad reality, we should take a force to correct and improve it!</p>
<h3>Commemorating the Changwei Campaign, Mourning the Soldiers and Civilians Who Died, Tears and Lamentations Flow Together, Wang Yaowu Delivers a Solemn Speech</h3>
<p>[Dispatch from Jinan, This Newspaper, 12th (Delayed)] At 9:00 am on the 12th, various sectors of Shandong jointly held a memorial service for the late Committee Member Zhang Tianzuo and the soldiers and civilians who died in the Changwei-Zibo Campaign with the deepest grief. More than a thousand people attended, presided over by Wang Yaowu himself, who delivered a speech in an extremely solemn tone. "In this Changwei Campaign, the late Committee Member Zhang sacrificed himself for righteousness and committed suicide. We should all follow the spirit of sacrifice of Martyr Zhang to quell the rebellion. The government and newspapers have significantly rewarded Wang Fenggang's tactics, but our late Committee Member Zhang can be compared to Wang Fenggang. He not only brought honor to his hometown, but also brought pride to Shandong. Therefore, we should follow Martyr Zhang's method and carry forward his spirit." To achieve this goal, Wang decided on the spot to hold a pre-ceremony review meeting at the same location at 8:00 am on the 13th, requiring the attendance of all battalion commanders and above of the local troops. Those who are loyal and brave will be rewarded generously, and those who neglect their superiors, soldiers, and the people will be severely punished without leniency. Subsequently, the Speaker of the Yiyihui and others delivered speeches one after another, which were passionate, tragic, full of sound and tears. At 11:00 am, this historical grand ceremony of "Achievements Remaining for a Thousand Years, Righteousness Inspiring the Three Qis" concluded in a mournful and tearful atmosphere.</p>
<h3>American Experts Gregerson et al. Invited to Participate in the Study of Yang Mei, Dr. Chen Zhiqian Talks About the Testing Work</h3>
<p>[Dispatch from Chongqing, This Newspaper, 13th] Dr. Chen Zhiqian, the former director of the Sichuan Provincial Health Department and the current president of the Central Hospital in Chongqing and concurrently president of the Chongqing Medical College, who recently returned to Chongqing from Nanjing, met with Dr. Liu Ruiheng, the chairman of the American Medical Aid to China, in Shanghai. Liu was also skeptical about Yang Mei's nine years of fasting, but has invited the famous American physiologist Gregerson and his assistant Root to participate in the study of Yang Mei in the future. Gregerson has left the United States and is currently on his way to China, and Root has arrived in Nanjing. They were originally invited to lecture at Central University for a month in July, and will come to Chongqing on August 1 to plan matters related to the physiology department of Chongqing Medical College. Chen confirmed that the preliminary observation methods of Yang Mei by the Health Bureau were not thorough enough. He stated that matter exists permanently, and so far no theory has been found that matter can be produced without matter. Therefore, the study of Yang Mei is not only the responsibility of the medical community, but also requires the participation of researchers who have a deep understanding of this in the scientific community. He expressed disagreement with any doctor who is willing to participate in the examination of Yang Mei and express opinions, because research is a set of knowledge and must be familiar with document records, so that the conclusions they make can be explained without error by other scientists before a judgment can be made. He gave an example to explain that before the war, a certain German physiologist tested the beating of the heart, using instruments to record, in order to prove that the effect of the heart had undergone several tests, and his own records were consistent, and all were different from the records of the past medical community, which caused a global shock and aroused the attention of the scientific community. A group of scientists studied the results of his laboratory and found that the electricity used in his laboratory test was connected to another wire, so that the same wave-like beating record could be obtained without the heart, causing a big joke. Science cannot be monopolized by one person. Before studying Yang Mei, various factors, such as the coordination of time, equipment, and personnel, need to be carefully prepared. Therefore, he advocated that the examination of Yang Mei should be discussed after experts such as Ge and Luo arrive in Chongqing, which is the most appropriate. Before it is proven, do not spread too much rumors. His opinion is consistent with that of Liu Ruiheng, that is, researchers who want to do this kind of work must be familiar with the research object. This cannot be overemphasized by biological nutrition experts. They usually study animal nutrition, and now they have shifted from studying rabbits and mice to Yang Mei. Although the object is different, the method is the same. Observing the phenomenon alone cannot prove the correctness of the research. Zhang Qun was in Chongqing and talked with him in detail about Yang Mei. He emphasized that the test should not have a time limit. Scientific discoveries must not have doubts. If others have doubts about this, it means that there is a problem in this science. Every new scientific discovery cannot be achieved overnight. Even small tests are prone to loopholes, let alone such a major event as Yang Mei.</p>

<h3>Arab League Issues Ultimatum: Requests Cessation of Jewish Violation of Truce; Bernadotte Arrives in Rhodes with Staff; Transjordan King Insists on Establishing Arab Sovereignty in Holy Land</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 13th Dispatch] UN Palestine Mediator Bernadotte has flown from Tel Aviv to Rhodes in the Aegean Sea on the 13th, where he will establish his headquarters. Before his departure, Bernadotte stated that his sixty-three truce observers would arrive on the front lines within forty-eight hours. Small-scale conflicts were expected during the initial truce period, but the situation is expected to improve after the arrival of the truce observers.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Damascus, 13th Dispatch] Syrian Prime Minister Marden announced that before UN Palestine Mediator Bernadotte left Damascus for Tel Aviv today, he had been presented with a joint note from Arab countries stating that if the Jewish side did not strictly comply with the ceasefire order before 11:00 AM standard time on the 13th, the Arab armies would launch a general offensive on all fronts. Meanwhile, Syrian officials announced today that Jewish forces violated the ceasefire order again on the night of the 12th, attacking Malki on the Lebanese border, and in another location, one Syrian soldier was killed by Jewish forces.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Beirut, 13th Dispatch] The Lebanese government today presented UN Mediator Bernadotte with a note protesting the violation of the ceasefire order by Jewish armored units, which attacked Lebanese defense lines seventeen kilometers northeast of Nazareth twice on Saturday, and stated that the Lebanese government reserves all rights regarding this matter.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Damascus, 12th Dispatch] Reliable sources report: UN Mediator Bernadotte has submitted a three-page coded report to the Security Council regarding the ceasefire situation in the Holy Land, in which he accuses the Jewish side of bearing the main responsibility for violating the ceasefire order. Before leaving Damascus for Tel Aviv today, Bernadotte said, "I have a plan in mind to deal with the violation of the ceasefire order, but it is not yet time to announce it. I hope that the acts of violating the ceasefire can be stopped, but I do not intend to make a hasty judgment before hearing the other party's explanation." An enemy plane appeared over Damascus again last night, and the alert was lifted only after three hours and fifteen minutes.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Amman, 12th Dispatch] Transjordan King Abdullah issued a declaration today, stating that if a unified Arab-Jewish state is established in Palestine, the people of Transjordan will not oppose the participation of Arabs. The Arab countries' acceptance of the ceasefire is a demonstration to the world that the Arab nation is not a bloodthirsty nation. The Arab armies entered Palestine to restore peace and order in the area, and are now ready to negotiate with the Jewish people to resolve the Palestine issue. If the Jewish people agree to belong to the Arab state of Palestine, the Arabs are prepared to grant full citizenship rights and even allow them autonomy within the region. All past atrocities can be forgiven.</p>
<h3>British Foreign Secretary Prepares to Visit Germany: To Deliver Speech Hoping Germany Rejoins the International Community</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, London, 13th Dispatch] The Sunday Observer exclusively published today that the Foreign Secretary is planning to visit Germany, which will be Bevin's first visit to Germany after the Potsdam Conference. It is believed that he wants to personally investigate how to implement the London Agreement and to what extent the joint occupation zone has successfully assisted West Germany in the reconstruction of Europe. Bevin may depart for Germany after the French Parliament approves the London Agreement.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Sheffield, England, 12th Dispatch] Foreign Secretary Bevin delivered a public speech here, advocating giving Germany the opportunity to rejoin the international community as a member. His hope for Germany is that it can coexist peacefully with its neighbors by peaceful means rather than by using swords. He expressed regret that the post-war European problems have not yet been resolved, but expressed satisfaction that progress has been made in organizing Western Europe.</p>
<p>Hoping for Jewish-Arab Truce</p>
<p>Regarding the Palestine issue, he hopes that the Jewish and Arab peoples of Palestine can find a solution, as both are Semitic peoples and only differ in religious beliefs. Therefore, there should not be an unsolvable problem between Jews and Arabs to achieve peaceful coexistence.</p>
<p>War Debt of 20 Billion Pounds</p>
<p>Referring to the European Recovery Program and the cost of the war, he said that Britain has spent a huge amount of money on the war and has a debt of 20 billion pounds. If Britain calculates the money spent from the beginning to the end of the war, the expenses Britain has obtained under the European Recovery Program are only a very small part of what Britain has already spent. In short, the only hope now is that war will not happen again, in which case the pound debt and war debt will not occur.</p>
<h3>Romania Recognizes Israel</h3>

<h3>Truce Observers in Holy Land Conduct On-Site Investigation</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 12th Dispatch] Twenty-four hours after the ceasefire order came into effect, the fighting in Palestine had not yet stopped.

UN ceasefire observers have rushed to both locations to investigate. According to a dispatch from Haifa, Colonel Sphalival, the senior UN truce supervisor and personal advisor to Bernadotte, flew from Haifa to Damascus today to investigate the fighting on the Palestine-Syria border.

<h3>Western Allies Launch New Political Offensive in Germany: Aimed at Forming a Unified German Government</h3>
<p>[United Press, Berlin, 13th Dispatch] The Western countries have launched their first large-scale political offensive against the Soviet Union in Germany since the war, with the aim of not only politically winning over West Germany, but also winning over all of Germany, including Soviet-controlled East Germany. The Soviet Union's response to this offensive may determine whether there will be a risk of war between the East and West sides soon. In short, that is the meaning of the London Six-Power Conference.</p>
<p>It is generally believed that since the Soviet Union did not attend the London Conference, the federal government established by the conference's resolutions will only be limited to the occupation zones of the United Kingdom, the United States, and France. However, officials have stated that there is no such restriction. On the contrary, Germans will be encouraged to establish a government with the authority to represent all of Germany. According to US military governor Clay yesterday, the Frankfurt government intends to include as much of Germany as possible, and there is no reason to say that it cannot represent East Germany. At the same time, almost all German political leaders oppose the establishment of a government limited to West Germany. Some people advocate that representatives from the eastern occupation zone should also participate in the future cabinet.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Berlin, 12th Dispatch] US Military Governor of Germany General Clay said at a press conference today, "The currency reform plan for the western occupation zone has not yet been finalized. After obtaining this decision, we will immediately notify the Soviet side. It has not yet been determined whether West Berlin should be included in this reform." Referring to the six-power agreement on Germany, Clay said, "We are not forcing the German people" to establish a West German government. We hope that the German people can have a responsible government to solve their own problems. However, they have absolute freedom to choose the way and date of establishing the government." When a reporter asked why the US military removed the German locomotive from the Anhalt station, Clay replied that the locomotive was very valuable and needed to be protected. The US authorities did not want to take it away from Germany, but the US military would provide it with the necessary protection.</p>
<h3>US Senate Appropriations Committee Approves: $4 Billion in Aid to Europe; Shortens Time for 12 Months Use</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 12th Dispatch] The US Senate Appropriations Committee today approved $4 billion in aid to Europe, largely restoring the amount cut by the House of Representatives.

<h3>Various Countries Oppose US Support for Japan: US Authorities Feel Very Tricky; State Department Seeks to Eliminate Concerns</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 12th Dispatch] Authoritative sources said on the 12th that the United States is planning to intensify its propaganda to explain its policy towards Japan to other countries. For several weeks, US officials have been increasingly concerned about protests from China and other countries regarding the US plan to restore the Japanese economy to a relatively high level. They believe that unless countermeasures are taken, relations between the United States and its former allies will become tense, making cooperation more difficult. The State Department also intends to dispel the concerns of those who believe that Japan's prosperity will threaten world peace again. The technique is to propose environment and security, which US officials believe are sufficient to demonstrate that Japan cannot threaten peace again.</p>
<h3>Japanese Whaling Results</h3>
<p>[United Press, Tokyo, 13th Dispatch] From April 1 to June 8 this year, three whaling companies caught 133 small whales in the waters near Mount Kinkasan, about 200 miles northeast of here.

<h3>Three East European Countries Recognize the Republic of Indonesia</h3>

<h3>French Parliament Continues to Debate West German Agreement: Bidault Encounters Difficulties; Left-Wing Members Spare No Effort in Attacking the Government</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Paris, 12th Dispatch] The National Assembly's debate on the London Six-Power Conference Agreement has reached its second day. Apart from a speech by Foreign Minister Bidault, no one else has expressed support. The dull atmosphere in the chamber has made observers doubt that the government will be able to obtain parliamentary approval of the six-power agreement when the debate is resumed. What most stimulated the government was that when Bidault delivered his speech, only members of the Popular Republican Party and a few moderates occasionally applauded, while when former Minister of Aviation Godde, a left-wing member, spoke out to reject the London Conference proposal, there were repeated enthusiastic applause.</p>
<p>When Godde mentioned that "if we say 'yes'," although it will make our country's relations with Britain and the United States easier to deal with in a short period of several weeks, the difficulties later will inevitably increase day by day, applause erupted from every corner of the hall. Godde also said, "If we say 'yes' to this resolution that disregards the legitimate demands of Nazi victims, then we will inevitably say 'yes' forever in the future. We must not think that the acquisition of Marshall Aid depends on our country's approval of the six-power proposal. If this is indeed the case, it can prove that someone is criticizing the United States' motivation for launching Marshall Aid, and there is indeed something to it. If we say 'no', then the entire European recovery problem can be reconsidered on a broader and better basis, rather than just becoming a politically motivated action in the struggle between the United States and the Soviet Union. I hope that Europe can respond to this six-power proposal with a 'no', and it is okay to use diplomatic rhetoric to respond with a 'no' in the most polite way, but our attitude must remain firm." Some observers believe that after two days of parliamentary debate on the matter, the impression that the six-power proposal is unfavorable to France has been formed across the country. Even Socialist Party Secretary-General Philip has stated that the Socialist Party intends to obtain more guarantees before deciding to support the government. Bidault's speech yesterday, which lasted two hours, only confirmed that the only effective one-official Ruhr system that France supported has been rejected by the London Conference, and Bidault has admitted that there is no clear guarantee of Western Europe's military security.</p>

<h3>Dulles' Anti-Communist Theory: Adhere to Beliefs and Strive for Victory</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Schenectady, New York, 13th Dispatch] Republican foreign policy expert Dulles reiterated his strong anti-communism views in a speech at the Union College graduation ceremony here today. He said that the current challenge of communism is to make free societies stand still, while communism is the vanguard of reform. Therefore, we must never allow ourselves to be dragged into the death trap of communism. The reforms demanded by communism are bad and self-defeating methods, so we must never accept communism. In the current ideological and spiritual struggle of mankind, only those with strong beliefs can achieve victory.</p>
<h3>Churchill's Roar: Condemns Labour Cabinet</h3>
<p>[United Press, London, 12th Dispatch] Opposition leader Churchill said in a speech at a Conservative Party gathering today: He felt that "if the current government's life is extended, then we will fall into an irredeemable crisis." Churchill accused Britain of relying on the United States as a "terrible fact." He said; he originally hoped that the US loan obtained in 1945 could enable Britain to tide over the transition from war to peace, and allow Britain to have a breathing opportunity after wartime poverty in order to reorganize its businesses. But the loan has been wasted in two years, forcing us to rely on the "generosity" of the United States again. At the same time, we are constantly depleting our remaining overseas investments and the assets accumulated under the capitalist system in the past to the point of exhaustion.</p>
<p>If the Labour government continues to govern, the most capable and resourceful Britons will emigrate abroad, and all that will remain in the country is a group of officials and a large number of starving people. Our position in the world will not only completely lose our personal self-esteem, but also the independence of the country will not be guaranteed.</p>

<h3>New Medical Invention: Atomic Needles to Treat Cancer</h3>
<p>[United Press, New York, 12th Dispatch] Scientific Daily reported: The medical community has invented the atomic needle method for treating cancer. The needle is made of cobalt and nickel. After being exercised in an atomic pile or atomic furnace for a short time, it is taken out, and the needle emits light similar to radium needles, but is more powerful. Atomic needles can be made into a curved shape to suit the condition, which radium needles cannot. Also, radium needles are hollow needles, filled with radon gas, which sometimes leaks, endangering the patient's body. Atomic needles are solid needles, without this danger. Atomic needles have magnetic properties and can be used with a magnet as a handle, while radium needles must be clamped with titanium tweezers.</p>

<h3>City Chamber of Commerce Sends Telegram to the Legislative Yuan Opposing the Levy of Property Tax, Believing that Investigating Wealthy Families and Rectifying Tax Administration Can Already Restrain Capital and Equalize Wealth</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce, in response to news reports that the Legislative Yuan is discussing a draft of the Provisional Property Tax Regulations, which, if passed and implemented, will inevitably lead to various abuses, sent a special telegram to the Legislative Yuan, detailing the reasons why the tax is untenable, believing that only by investigating wealthy families and rectifying tax administration can capital be restrained and wealth equalized.</p>
<p>The original telegram stated: "To the esteemed Legislative Yuan in Nanjing: It is reported that forty-nine members of the Legislative Yuan, including Liu Butong, have proposed a draft of the Provisional Property Tax Regulations, intending to use surplus to make up for deficiencies, balance wealth, and supplement national expenditures. We deeply admire this far-sighted plan. However, we believe that the proposal to levy property tax originated when the government moved to the provisional capital, during the intense period of the War of Resistance, when foreign aid was insufficient, and military needs were extremely urgent. At that time, wealthy families and magnates, relying on their power and influence, took advantage of the national crisis to develop their private property, seizing opportunities and benefiting from all sides. The intention of the proponents was to reduce the harsh taxes and express national indignation. This was indeed a move to prescribe the right medicine for the ailment. Unfortunately, the power of public opinion was like a mayfly trying to shake a tree. Those who were targeted by thousands had already taken their assets and left the country freely. The original proposal had to be slightly changed, from property tax to National Reconstruction Special Contribution, and then to Relief Special Contribution, starting with persuasion and then moving to fundraising. The targets of the fundraising were trade associations or hometown associations, and the fundraising standard was personal property worth 5 billion yuan or more, levied at one-tenth. Targeting trade associations meant that the levy fell not on wealthy families but on industry and commerce. Setting the starting point at 5 billion yuan, according to the pre-war rice price ratio, was only equivalent to 6,000 or 7,000 yuan in the 25th year of the Republic [1936]. Therefore, the target of the levy was not focused on the very rich but was widespread among the moderately affluent. This property tax, which is different in name but the same in substance and has already changed its nature, is being implemented in Tianjin, Shanghai, Hankou, Chengdu, Guangzhou, and other places. The Provisional Property Tax is intended as a temporary measure to address extraordinary national circumstances, levied once to supplement deficits. There is no reason for the former to be in the process of implementation while the latter follows one after another. Compared to regular taxes such as income tax, which is levied only once a year, this is even more burdensome. Such a situation contradicts the original intention of the so-called 'provisional' in the Provisional Property Tax. Our Chamber dares to respectfully present this to your esteemed Yuan and to correct the public's perception. Today's industrial and commercial enterprises have either moved to the rear, contributing to the national war effort and enduring the hardships of relocation and displacement for eight years, or have suffered robbery by the enemy and puppet regimes during the period of occupation. Although they have barely managed to salvage the remains, due to the turbulence of the situation, the obstruction of transportation, the decline in people's purchasing power, and the increasing severity of national control laws, they are struggling to survive, barely managing to make ends meet. In terms of national obligations, in addition to paying increasingly heavy commodity taxes, business taxes, business license taxes, profit-seeking enterprise income taxes, special excessive profit taxes, and various local taxes, city defense donations, and pacification donations, other public welfare and charitable donations, winter relief, troop support, and scholarship donations, which are the responsibility of industry and commerce to share, amount to dozens of cases each year. The names of these are created at any time, and it is difficult to list them all in the records. In particular, the banking and textile industries are generally noticed, and donations are often listed at the top. In fact, in recent years, the banking industry has been subject to regulations as dense as hairs, and business constraints are numerous, which is beyond what most people can imagine. Moreover, due to the dispersion of funds, the current capital of two or three hundred banks and firms is not even comparable to that of a large-scale bank before the war. Their financial strength is weak, far beyond what most people expect. The textile industry, on the other hand, faces high labor costs, severe shortages of raw materials, and shrinking sales, and its difficulties are unprecedented. These situations are known only to those who experience them and cannot be easily explained to outsiders. If, after industry and commerce have been drained, they are forced to pay heavy and overlapping property taxes, it is expected that in the future they will only be able to use factory buildings, land, machinery, and equipment as in-kind payments to offset their tax burden. The result will be to promote capital flight, business bankruptcy, and a large-scale suspension of production. Tax revenue will inevitably decrease, and unemployment will inevitably increase. Although the current measure may be pleasing for a time, winning the joy and praise of some people, the serious consequences are not worth the gain. It will only allow wealthy families to laugh secretly on the sidelines, while industry and commerce, which are considered the middle class of the country, will decline from this point on. Considering the standpoint of national politics, this is also truly uneasy. General public opinion often says that levying property tax can curb private monopoly capital. In fact, taking the salt loans, cocoon loans, and tea loans of recent years as examples, merchants rely entirely on loans from national banks and bureaus to purchase goods. Private monopoly capital has long declined, and state capital is gradually forming. There is factual evidence to this effect. The arguments made by commentators are almost unfounded. We believe that the most dangerous phenomenon in recent years is the divergence between the will of the state and the people. The people criticize the authorities for 'misgovernment,' while the authorities criticize the people for 'lack of conscience.' Moreover, within the people, opinions are clearly divided. Scholars criticize industry and commerce for only seeking their own self-interest, while industry and commerce criticize scholars for not understanding the people's hardships. If we do not sincerely seek the root cause of these mutual recriminations, we fear that we will repeat the mistakes of the past, where 'what arises in the heart harms the government.' Discord at the court, the repeat of the late Ming dynasty's downfall, is truly worrying. The property tax issue is just one aspect of this. Our Chamber, from the standpoint of 'coming from the fields,' assesses the overall situation and offers this humble opinion, not only to plead for the interests of industry and commerce, but because the currently proposed Provisional Property Tax has lost the original essence of the property tax, and is different in name but the same in substance as the Relief Special Contribution, which is currently being levied. One tax is levied twice. Moreover, the levy procedures and the encouragement of reporting and the issuance of tax payment certificates in the original draft, if implemented, will inevitably cause national turmoil, with everyone living in fear. The abuses that will result are unbearable to speak of. In short, from any point of view, this proposal has no reason to exist. We respectfully ask your esteemed Yuan to adopt public opinion and reject it, as this would be in the public interest. Our Chamber has further suggestions. The state's financial deficit has reached this point, and relying solely on issuing currency to meet immediate needs is like drinking poison to quench thirst. Before the thirst is quenched, the person will die. Who among the citizens is not worried? Therefore, planning to increase revenue and balance the budget is the most urgent task. Currently, the concentration of wealth does not lie in industry and commerce, but in the hands of a few wealthy families with special privileges. We have heard that members of your esteemed Legislative Yuan have proposed organizing a committee to investigate the assets of wealthy families. If you can resolutely and thoroughly continue the unfinished business of the former National Political Council, then you will find the pearl without harming the national vitality and benefiting the annual revenue. In the past, the Chu Prime Minister destroyed his family to relieve the national crisis, and ultimately revived the state of Chu. Noble families should follow the example of their predecessors. Different eras, same principles. This would further inspire people's feelings and be forever prayed for and cherished by the people. This is the first point. Restraining capital and balancing wealth is the only way for modern countries to avoid economic revolution. It is only a matter of proper implementation, without the need to create too many names, which would disturb the local communities and only enrich corrupt officials. The accumulation of private capital, tracing its origin, is nothing more than owning land, engaging in profit-making businesses, securities deposits, and property rentals. Accumulating small amounts into large sums gradually leads to manipulation and control. Today, the Land Law already has progressive taxation on land appreciation. Profit-making businesses, securities deposits, and property rentals, in addition to being subject to classified income tax, are also subject to comprehensive income tax, and the tax rates are progressively levied. All of these are the methods used by modern countries to achieve the goal of balancing wealth through the tax system. Our country also has everything it should have, but either the matter is still in its initial stages, or its implementation is not widespread, or the investigation is not thorough, and the agencies are numerous, the powers are dispersed, the discipline is lax, and the effectiveness is weak. The personnel system is not perfect, and all the tools cannot be coordinated. To correct the previous malpractices, it is necessary to reduce the number of taxes, simplify the tax system, identify key points, and refresh personnel, in order to achieve the original goal of thoroughly making up for the budget and balancing wealth. Some commentators say that the current tax system can only exploit the common people and cannot suppress the wealthy, and therefore they want to establish a property tax to remedy this. In fact, the current tax laws in our country, such as the salt tax, which is increased multiple times, the wheat flour tax, which is under consideration, and the food and entertainment tax, do indeed have the effect of increasing the burden on the common people. If the entire tax system is said to be helping the rich and exploiting the poor, and one wants to establish a property tax to seek innovation, then this is purely clinging to one side, and is an overly激动的词语 [激动的词语 = "emotionally charged language"]. If the current shortcomings in tax collection cannot be eliminated, then more taxes will only lead to more abuses, which will not benefit the national treasury as before. Factory buildings, land, machinery, and equipment will become the targets of taxation. Instead of collecting taxes on their surplus profits, they will actually be collecting taxes on their means of production. It is feared that after one property tax, capital will flee and production will cease. Various commodity taxes, classified income taxes, and comprehensive income taxes will be greatly reduced. It is feared that the state's taxation targets will only be concentrated on the majority of the common people, and the burden on the common people will become even heavier, which is the opposite of what the commentators are worried about. This is the second point. We believe that this case concerns the major plan of the country. If a decision is made hastily, it will only complicate matters further. Your esteemed Yuan is a public opinion agency, and you should listen to the different opinions of the people's organizations as much as possible, to show your humility and tolerance. Therefore, we do not mind being verbose and repeatedly offering our advice. The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce respectfully submits this document."</p>
<h3>Newspaper Workers Request Rice Rationing, Civilian Affairs Committee Still Has Not Replied</h3>
<p>According to the Newspaper Workers' Union, the Civilian Affairs Committee's preferential rice rationing for news professionals did not include members of this union. A document was submitted to the Civilian Affairs Committee on the 5th of this month requesting equal rationing, and the union has not yet received a response from the committee. However, recent newspaper reports have stated that the rationing was sometimes canceled, sometimes misrepresented, and sometimes restored. These reports lack substance and cannot be relied upon. The union is currently awaiting a reply from the Civilian Affairs Committee to determine the true situation. Furthermore, the Peiping Newspaper and Printing Workers' Union has also expressed sympathy and support for this union's protest, as the rice rationing for news professionals does not include printing workers.</p>

<h3>Mingyuanfang Tenant Association Submits Petition to the Garrison Command, Requesting to Stop Soldiers from Forcibly Occupying Civilian Housing</h3>
<p>Mingyuanfang, 772 Longyang Road in this city, was colluded with by the traitor Han Youshun and Japanese chiefs Kubota and Kubodera during the enemy and puppet period (May 1943), who used Japanese military police force to expel all residents and seize the houses for Jewish refugees to live in. After the victory, the original residents organized the "Mingyuanfang Tragedy Victim Tenant Association," registered as refugees, and petitioned the municipal government and all parties to restore their residence. After repeated negotiations with the American Jewish Association by the municipal government, it took three years, until March 1947, to send the Jewish people back to their countries in batches, and order the original residents of the neighborhood to restore their original homes in batches, reaching three-quarters. Now there are only eleven Jewish buildings left, which will be evacuated recently. However, starting from the 1st of this month, unarmed soldiers have successively invaded the Jewish houses in the name of various military institutions and are occupying them. The Jewish people cannot resist and reported to their representatives for negotiation, but there was no result. The Tenant Association has recently submitted a petition to the Garrison Command, making a complaint, hoping that the authorities will find a reasonable solution.</p>

<h3>The Complicated Inside Story of Ji Juemi's Family Dispute: Suffering from Polygamy, Disputes Arising from Property; Indentured Children Seek Father to Maintain Their Livelihoods; Mother and Son Being Sued May Lead to Further Complications</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Report] On the 7th of this month, this newspaper published a news item titled "Ji Juemi's Family Dispute: Lawsuit Against Two Defendants, Male and Female." This news appeared ordinary and simple, and perhaps did not attract much attention. However, it contains an extraordinarily complex and intriguing story. Those familiar with the inside story predict that this property damage case may be the precursor to a major lawsuit in the years to come.</p>
<p>The news on the 7th described that the defendant, Lu Qing, and her son, Ji Yupeng, went to the residence of the plaintiff, Fan Fumi, on April 26th of this year, seeking her husband but were refused entry. In a moment of anger, they smashed the utensils and glass windows in the kitchen, as well as the car, etc. After investigation, Prosecutor Li Chaozhu concluded that the two defendants were suspected of property damage and filed a public prosecution with the Criminal Division of the District Court.</p>
<p>Although the indictment for the property damage case did not specify who Zhao Luqing's husband was, the reporter had already clarified in the news that this was the family dispute of Ji Juemi, a wealthy Jewish merchant in Hardoon's family. Since Ji's life had an inseparable relationship with Hardoon, Ji's family dispute must also be related to Aili Garden.</p>
<p>Sharing the Same Sorrow: Bodao Without a Son</p>
<p>Hardoon's trust in Ji Juemi during his lifetime was well-known. In Hardoon's eulogy, Ji compared himself to Guan Zhong and Bao Shuya, saying, "Our friendship is like brothers, side by side for thirty years, forming the bond of Guan and Bao, holding mourning attire like Yelü." After Luo Jialing inherited her husband's business, she relied even more heavily on Ji, entrusting him with all the affairs inside and outside Aili Garden. In name, they had already become sworn siblings from being employer and guest. Hardoon and his wife could not have children, having no offspring, male or female. Ji Juemi also had this deficiency. The three of them shared the same sorrow and worried about having heirs. Therefore, they once made a vow to jointly adopt 100 foster children. Although this plan was not fully realized, they did adopt dozens of poor children and orphans at the time. Later, they repeatedly eliminated some. Hardoon adopted four sons and six daughters, who took Hardoon as their surname. Luo Jialing adopted five sons and three daughters, who took Luo as their surname. Ji Juemi adopted four sons, who took Ji as their surname, named Yu Sheng, Yu Long, Yu Qiang, and Yu Peng, respectively. These foster children all called Hardoon "Father," Luo Jialing "Mother," and Ji Juemi "Papa," "Daddy," or "Uncle." Ji Juemi's four sons also grew up in Aili Garden and received the same treatment as other foster children. Luo Jialing also treated them as if they were her own, without any discrimination.</p>
<p>The Outbreak of War Ceased Disputes; Abandoning Grievances, Reconciliation and Settlement Were Reached</p>
<p>Luo Jialing passed away in October of the 30th year of the Republic of China. At that time, two wills appeared, one with George Hardoon as the heir and the other with Ji Juemi as the main heir. Neither side would give in, and they litigated in the British court in Shanghai. Before two months had passed, the Pacific War broke out, and the inheritance lawsuit was virtually suspended. All the遗产 was occupied and managed by the Japanese army. Ji Juemi and George Hardoon abandoned their grievances and reached a settlement. All the foster children received a share of the estate. Ji Juemi obtained real estate such as Cishu Lane on Nanjing Road, Ciyi Lane on Jiujiang Road, and six mu of land along Foch Road in Aili Garden. However, Yu Sheng, Yu Long, Yu Qiang, and Yu Peng, although also foster sons (calling Luo Jialing "Mother"), were not entitled to inherit Luo Jialing's estate due to their status. Moreover, their foster father became increasingly cold towards them and even refused to provide financial support. At the same time, they were gradually not tolerated in Aili Garden. Except for Yu Sheng, who had a good relationship with Luo's brothers and was allowed to stay in the garage in the garden, Yu Long now lives with his family in a small hotel. Yu Qiang and Yu Peng (both unmarried) moved to No. 28, Lane 119, Shaanxi North Road, the residence of Ji Juemi's wife, Wang Chengzheng. Wang is now 44 years old and, during the period of the 14th and 15th years of the Republic of China, lived with Ji Juemi at the same time as the recently sued Ms. Zhao Luqing.</p>
<p>The Ownership of the Main Residence on Nanyang Road Becomes a Problem</p>
<p>In the 31st year of the Republic of China, Ji, through the introduction of the "Tianlu Marriage Agency," met Fan Fumi, the plaintiff in the property damage case, and immediately began cohabiting with her. Since then, Ji only sent a small amount of living expenses to Wang and Zhao each month and never visited them again. Wang was thus stimulated and suffered from mental illness, having been bedridden for several years. However, cherishing old feelings, she was reluctant to break up with Ji. Zhao Luqing, having lost favor with Ji, also intended to sell a residence at No. 145 Nanyang Road last month due to economic difficulties to a Christian gathering place. The buyer entrusted lawyer Fei Xizhen to publish advertisements in the Jiaxin and Liangbao newspapers on May 25th, 26th, and 27th, soliciting objections. On the 28th of the same month, lawyer Zhang Shiying, representing Juemi Trading Company, came forward to intervene, stating that the property was the assets of the company owner acting in the name of the hall, and without the consent of the company owner, no one may assert any claim. According to the reporter's investigation, the garden house residence was purchased by Ji Juemi for Zhao Luqing's residence before the war. The account name at the time of purchase was "Pan Jinle," but there is also a story as to why "Pan" was used instead of "Ji" or "Zhao." It is rumored that Ji Juemi's original surname was "Pan," and his hometown was Tingsu Weining. He changed his surname to Ji after coming to Shanghai. "Jinle" was a nickname given by Ji to Zhao, while Wang Chengzheng also had a nickname, "Fengle." Therefore, Zhao Luqing believes that this main residence is property given to her by Ji, and she has absolute freedom to dispose of it.</p>
<p>Entering Open Strife from Secrecy</p>
<p>Before planning the sale, Zhao had repeatedly sought Ji's opinion, but to no avail. On April 26th, she went to No. 6, Lane 382, Henan Road to find Ji, which led to a conflict with Fan Fumi and caused the property damage case. After this, Zhao Luqing resolutely decided to sell, but Ji Juemi immediately publicly opposed it. Thus, Ji Juemi's family dispute entered open strife from secrecy. Yu Sheng and his four brothers also hired legal counsel early on to negotiate with their foster father, requesting some funds or a job to maintain their livelihoods. However, after this case occurred, the situation changed drastically. Yu Peng and the other three believe that although the plaintiff in the property damage case is Fan Fumi, their father actually has the power to control it. Now, to sue his son and wife for such a trivial matter goes against common sense, and they deeply fear that more unfortunate events will occur. Therefore, they are running around every day, seeking help from relatives, friends, and lawyers, living in constant anxiety.</p>
<h3>Fire on Sichuan Middle Road: Girl Buried in Flames, Young Woman Injured in Fall</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Report] The Tianxingxiang Western Clothing Store at No. 575 Sichuan Middle Road (south of the YMCA), where a Cantonese woman named Li Ruiqi lived, caught fire at around 6:40 yesterday morning due to a cooking accident. The fire suddenly spread to the dormitory of Baocheng Money Exchange in the front building. At that time, the wind was strong, blowing south, and in an instant, it affected the adjacent three-story residential building of the Huashang Dacheng Industrial and Commercial Society at No. 573, and the third floor of No. 569, all of which were burned down. The second floor of Huatai Bank at No. 569 suffered water damage, with losses of about 20 billion yuan. The three-story residential building of Longsheng Rice Store at Nos. 567-565 was also burned down. A large amount of white rice, about 700-800 dan, stored on the second floor and in the store was waterlogged, resulting in heavy losses. The third floor of Hengkang Woolen Western Clothing Store at No. 563 was also destroyed, and the woolen fabrics stored in the workshop on the second floor and the store on the ground floor were waterlogged, with losses estimated at 50 billion yuan. When the fire was raging, a relative's daughter, Ma Ping (15 years old), was hiding next to the stairs on the upper floor of Tianxingchang Western Clothing Store at No. 575. Later, the gasoline barrel next to the stairs exploded, causing her to be buried in the flames. Her body was charred, and it was unbearable to look at. A young woman, Ma Zhang (23 years old), was casually looking out on the balcony when she suddenly heard the fire alarm. She jumped down, resulting in fractures of her left thigh and left arm. She was then taken to Gongji Hospital by ambulance for treatment. After the fire broke out, the Central Fire Department was notified and immediately dispatched several pump trucks to rush to the scene to put out the fire. Later, Director Yu, Section Chief Zhou, and Captain Zhang arrived at the scene one after another to direct the firefighting. It took more than an hour to put out the fire. At the same time, the Huangpu Police Sub-Bureau, upon hearing the news, dispatched officer Yang Jihang to supervise a large number of uniformed police and plainclothes police to rush to the scene to maintain order. Later, the fire starter, Li Ruiqi, was detained and taken to the bureau to inquire about the cause of the fire for further investigation. It is reported that although the fire only burned down five three-story buildings, the value of those damaged by waterlogging amounted to over 100 billion yuan, making it another tragedy after the fire at Zhongfa Warehouse on Henan Road.</p>
<h3>Fire at Chengfeng Weaving Factory</h3>
<p>At around 6:25 yesterday afternoon, the Chengfeng Cotton Weaving Factory at No. 328 Taiyang Temple, Zhabei, suddenly caught fire due to a cigarette butt left in the raw materials. As a result, two factory buildings were burned down, and two workers, Tang Enmin (23 years old) suffered burns to the head, and Zhu Maoliang (36 years old) suffered burns to the back. They were later taken to the scene by the Zhabei Fire Brigade to extinguish the fire, and the injured were sent to Jimin Hospital for treatment.</p>

Female workers Chen Sutian, Chen Caidi, Xu Weixian, Ni Meimei, and Tang Hong were all injured in the face and hands, but fortunately, the injuries were minor. They were then taken to the Labor Hospital for treatment. The Fire Department dispatched a vehicle to the scene and used chemical foam to extinguish the fire, which was successfully put out, averting a major disaster.</p>
<h3>Robbery on Xikang Road Last Night: Seven Gold Rings and a Life Lost</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Report] Six robbers broke into the Li family at No. 32, Lane 567, Xikang Road, West Shanghai, at around 9:15 last night. Three robbers held firearms, and one robber held a hand grenade, threatening the victim. After about 15 minutes, they robbed seven gold rings. As the robbers were escaping with the stolen goods, Li's daughter, Caiying (23 years old), followed behind and shouted, "Robbers!" This angered the robbers, who turned back and fired a shot, hitting her in the head, causing her brains to splatter and killing her. The victim reported the incident to the Jiangning Police Sub-Bureau, which ordered a large number of police officers to arrive. However, the robbers had already disappeared. The body was taken to the Labor Hospital and then transported to the Jijilu autopsy room to report to the court for an examination.</p>
<h3>Small News from the Cultural Scene</h3>

<h3>Graduates of Local Military Academies Establish First Communications Branch</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Report] The Central Military Academies Graduates Investigation Office has 160 communication units distributed throughout the country, including approximately 700,000 graduates. Recently, graduates from the 15th to 18th classes of local military academies, in order to strengthen contact and communicate feelings, established a directly subordinate First Branch with the approval of the Shanghai Di Xun Office of the Investigation Office. There are approximately 200 people in the rescue team, most of whom have transferred to free professions after the victory. Yesterday at 2 pm, under the leadership of Director Chuan Siling Zhengmo and Deputy Director Han Cheng of the Shanghai Communications Office, a founding conference was held at the New Life Club. Commander Chuan encouraged the students to promote the Huangpu spirit and military expertise, to study advanced knowledge, and not to harbor the psychology of seeking promotion and wealth. He also stated that from June 16th, 1924, to the present, the total number of graduates from Huangpu and the Central Military Academy is more than 210,000. Over the past 20 years, more than 10,000 have sacrificed their lives for internal and external affairs, and the number of injured is about three or four times the number of dead. At present, the revolutionary task is not yet complete, and the responsibility is even heavier than before. He hopes that the graduates will continue their efforts.</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper Report] In order to promote land registration work, Director Zhu Ping of the Land Administration Bureau personally went to the bureau's First Land Registration Office in Yangjing District yesterday to convene a review meeting on land registration work in Yangjing District. Dozens of people, including district senators, the district chief, the chairman of the district people's representative assembly, and local gentry, participated. After thorough discussion, they strived to simplify the land registration procedures within the scope of the law.</p>
<h3>Registration Application Instructions</h3>
<p>Under the principle of facilitating property owners' applications, eleven instructions for land registration have been formulated, which are excerpted below: [1] Property owners applying for land registration should publish in the newspaper or provide a guarantee if any of the following circumstances exist: 1. Loss of single certificates, old certificate receipts, application forms, receipt of last characters, and official receipts. 2. The household name on the old certificate receipt, last character receipt, and official receipt does not match the applicant's household name. 3. Loss of certificate but possession of the serial, or possession of certificate but loss of serial. 4. Incomplete or damaged certificate serial or loss of the sales deed. 5. Other rights established before the war have been redeemed but not canceled. 6. The household name on the property certificate is a hall name or alias and should be changed to the true name of the obligee. 7. The land certificate is damaged, and the handwriting is illegible. 8. Loss of the purchase and sale contract or other evidence of ownership transfer. 9. Inheritance transfer without supporting documents. [2] The qualifications of the guarantor are specified in any of the following: A, the four neighbors of the land, B, reputable shops and the local Baojia chief or district people's representative or local people. [3] Anyone who loses a land practice certificate or ownership certificate must, in addition to providing a guarantee, also publish a statement in the newspaper declaring the loss as invalid. [4] When the area of land applied for registration exceeds two-tenths of the area recorded in the deed, the excess part shall be regarded as state-owned land, but the original occupant shall have priority to pay the price to contract for registration. If they do not pay the price, the excess part shall be reserved as public land. [5] All river beaches and other land for common use that cannot be divided should still be applied for registration as common rights. [6] Anyone who uses another person's land for the convenience of their own land should jointly apply for registration of the easement with the owner. [7] If the land survey mistakenly lists civilian land as public land, the original owner should submit documents and apply for verification and correction. [8] If the owner disagrees with the original measured boundary, they may apply for a re-measurement during the land survey. It is temporarily stipulated that no re-measurement fee will be charged, and re-measurement personnel will not collect any fees during the measurement. [9] During the cadastral survey or re-measurement, the obligee's neighbors should be present to indicate the boundaries to avoid errors. [10] The standards for paying registration fees at the time of registration are as follows: 1. The cost of the registration application form is 10,000 yuan per sheet. 2. The ownership registration fee is 2 per mille of the declared land price or right value. 3. The other rights registration fee is 2 per mille of the declared land price or right value. 4.

<h3>General Commodity Prices - Positive News Boosts Buying, Prices Continue to Rise</h3>
<p>Following the market performance of the previous weekend, commodity prices at the start of last week saw robust buying driven by positive news. The upward trend continued, with new highs frequently reached, and strong momentum persisted until the weekend, indicating another wave of price increases had arrived. While authorities are striving for urgent measures, strengthening controls, and tightening credit, they are struggling to counteract opposing forces, which dilute the impact of these measures, making it difficult to achieve effective results despite earnest efforts.</p>
<p>The wholesale price index compiled by this publication rose by 21.55% last week. Throughout the week, credit conditions remained loose. The clearing situation at the Central Bank showed a net inflow of over 1.3 trillion on Thursday due to the settlement of sugar and cotton yarn transactions, but the daily net inflow was less than 700 billion for the rest of the week. Fixed deposits from commercial banks at the Central Bank accumulated to a substantial 2.5 trillion by Thursday. Black market interest rates hovered within 30%. Meanwhile, the Hong Kong exchange rate frequently narrowed last week, repeatedly setting new records. The factors contributing to this new wave of price increases are summarized and analyzed below:</p>
<p>First, adjustments to state-owned enterprise prices: (1) Effective June 5th, nationwide shipping passenger and freight rates increased by 90%. However, passenger fares from Taiwan to Shanghai, calculated in Taiwan dollars, increased by 25%, while freight rates remained unchanged. (2) Effective June 7th, China Central and China National Aviation Corporation adjusted their fares, with the Southern routes (including Hong Kong, Xiamen, Taiwan, and Shantou) increasing by 85% of the original price, Western routes (including Chongqing, Guiyang, Kunming, and Chengdu) by 65%, and Northern routes (including Qingdao, Jinan, Beijing, and Panjin) by 55%. (3) Effective June 7th, nationwide railway passenger and freight rates were adjusted, with passenger tickets increasing by 50% of the original price, general freight by 90%, and valuable freight by 120%. (4) Various public utilities in this city adjusted to new prices on June 12th, with water and electricity increasing by approximately 35%. This series of price increases significantly increased freight costs, inevitably pushing up commodity prices. For example, the price of rice in Shanghai increased by 500,000 to 600,000 yuan per picul the day after the railway freight rate adjustment.</p>
<p>Second, loose and excessive credit. There are many reasons for loose credit conditions, the most fundamental being the government's massive expenditures and inability to balance revenue, relying on printing money to compensate, leading to continuous inflation and rising prices. The government's efforts to stabilize prices cannot address this fundamental issue, and ultimately, all stopgap measures are ineffective. According to reports, the national budget for the second half of the year will increase based on the budget figures for the first half, adjusted for the price index. With total budget revenue of over 5.8 trillion yuan and total expenditure of over 9.6 trillion yuan in the first half of the year, the expenditure for the second half of the year is estimated to reach approximately 360 trillion yuan, a staggering figure. In addition to this fundamental cause, recent accidental events include: (1) Rumors that the Central Bank will issue 10,000-yuan gold yuan certificates for circulation, setting a new record for banknote denominations at 200,000 yuan. (2) As previously mentioned in this publication, the authorities' ban on same-day check clearing, implemented on June 1st, aimed to reduce the speed of currency circulation and stabilize prices, but this is questionable. According to the head of the Financial Control Bureau, the issuance of commercial drafts has recently surged. Inspections indicate that the situation is generally good, and most drafts are issued in response to actual customer needs. However, this large-scale circulation of high-value commercial drafts naturally leads to credit expansion and increased currency circulation, inducing price increases. (3) Recently, the market has seen loose credit and abundant cash, with reports of over 1 trillion yuan in cash flowing in from North China daily.</p>
<p>Third, Central Bank Governor Yu's statement on Monday regarding full support for productive enterprises: "(1) The Central Bank will strive to support legitimate productive enterprises by providing funds through rediscounting or re-mortgaging, and will guide commercial banks to engage in promoting production and developing national resources. (2) The Central Bank will provide equal financing facilities to national and private financial institutions, without discrimination, under the premise of supporting productive enterprises. (3) The Central Bank will do its best to guide idle social capital into productive channels. The short-term treasury bills currently issued are not intended to balance the budget but to absorb idle social capital and guide it into production. In the past, low bank deposit rates led to a large influx of idle capital into the speculative market. This phenomenon can be reduced in the future. (4) With the Central Bank's measures now aimed at supporting productive enterprises, all industrial and commercial entities can strive for development, and it is hoped that commercial banks will cooperate with the Central Bank to complete this task." After this statement, the stock market soared the next day, as everyone had a new prediction for the future of productive enterprises, increasing investment interest and creating a flourishing market. We agree with Mr. Yu's statement in principle, but in its practical application, special attention should be paid to the distinction between genuine productive work and opportunistic speculation, as a slight negligence can lead to vastly different results.</p>
<p>Fourth, regarding the government's policy of selling commodities, the quantity sold recently has been decreasing, and the prices are gradually increasing. This indecisive approach gives speculators an incentive. For example, the government previously sold rice but announced a halt from the previous week. Regarding cotton yarn, it is rumored that the Ministry of Economic Affairs, citing low inventory levels, ordered the Yarn Control Committee to cease selling, which has led to a shift in market prices. In terms of allocation prices, 16-count Fairy yarn rose from 2.22 million yuan at the beginning of the week to 2.65 million yuan by the weekend, while Hankou fine velvet rose from 3.4 million yuan on June 1st to 4.8 million yuan on June 12th. Taiwan sugar's allocation price is also increasing due to the continuous adjustment of the Taiwan dollar exchange rate. Last week, the Taiwan dollar exchange rate was 375 yuan on Monday, 390 yuan on Wednesday, 401 yuan on Thursday, and 420 yuan on the weekend.</p>
<p>The trend of market prices last week continued to advance at high levels, with new prices being set almost daily, especially for grains, textiles, metals, and chemicals. All indices rose by more than 20%. Stimulated by the aforementioned factors, and due to the sharp contraction of the Hong Kong exchange rate and rumors of adjustments to foreign exchange rates, the stock market was exceptionally strong last week. Wing On cotton yarn reached a high of 3,815 yuan on Friday before closing at 3,700 yuan, setting a new record. Under this trend, foreign stocks were also very strong, with Ewo cotton yarn reaching a high of 5.81 million on Friday. In the yarn market, 42-count Blue Phoenix yarn stood at a high of 4.75 million yuan, 21-count Double Horse yarn at a high of 3.1 million yuan, and Dragon Head fine cloth broke the 10 million yuan mark by the weekend. Rice prices rose frequently due to reported price increases in Jiangsu and Zhejiang. In the Taipei market, white japonica rice was approaching a high of 9 million yuan, with off-market bids exceeding this figure. Other miscellaneous grains, oils, and flours also followed suit with rapid increases. Friday was the Dragon Boat Festival, and the grain market was completely closed. Daily necessities such as soap and matches continued to rise, with Gu Ben soap breaking the 10 million yuan mark by the weekend. Chemicals such as 100 kg of Moon Brand caustic soda rose from 1.95 million yuan at the beginning of the week to 2.24 million yuan on Friday.</p>

<h3>Monetary and Financial Affairs</h3>
<p>(1) Credit and Black Market Interest Rates</p>
<p>Last week, Friday coincided with the Dragon Boat Festival. Traditionally, many debts are settled around such holidays, which inevitably affects credit conditions. However, this year's objective conditions are different from the past. Cumulative inflation persists, and despite repeated attempts by banks to tighten credit, the desired effects have not been achieved. While materials are being sold off and same-day check clearing is prohibited, large-denomination gold yuan certificates are continuously being shipped in. According to reports from last week, 200 boxes of new banknotes, worth a total of 40 trillion yuan, were shipped from England to Shanghai. Although the authorities have formed a "Credit Coordination Committee" to suppress speculative capital, the amount of money issued inevitably far exceeds the amount collected, in order to cover today's huge fiscal deficits. This can be said to be the crux of the difficulty in tightening credit. As for the flow of capital from North to South and vice versa, and the substitution of commercial drafts for checks, these are merely derivative phenomena of malignant inflation. Without addressing the root cause, it is difficult to solve the superficial problems. Therefore, despite the opportune Dragon Boat Festival and the artificial tightening of credit, credit conditions remained loose throughout the week.</p>
<p>Black market interest rates were most commonly at 27%, with the weekend seeing some rates as low as 24% due to the excessive credit, making it difficult to lend money out. Interest rates outside the stock exchange also trended downwards. On Monday, the interest rate for the long side was 35 yuan per share, and the interest rate for the short side was 31 yuan per share, carrying over from the previous weekend. From Tuesday to Thursday, these rates decreased to 34 yuan and 30 yuan respectively, and then decreased by one yuan each on Friday.</p>
<p>Although the net inflow of the National Bank treasury from Monday to Friday reached 30,758 billion yuan, an increase of 12,627 billion yuan compared to the previous week, if we deduct the over 27 trillion yuan in fixed deposits from commercial banks at the Central Bank during the same period, the actual net inflow was only 2-3 trillion yuan. The effect of this 2-3 trillion yuan inflow on the overflowing speculative capital market is naturally minimal!</p>
<p>The net inflow of foreign banks from Monday to Friday totaled 772 billion yuan, a decrease of 440.8 billion yuan compared to the same period of the previous week.</p>
<p>Commercial banks generally had ample cash and commercial drafts. Interbank lending was infrequent. Clearing results for banks after number 60 showed a net outflow of 22,141 billion yuan from Monday to Friday, an increase of 10,642 billion yuan compared to the same period of the previous week. However, credit conditions in the market did not tighten as a result, indicating the general abundance of speculative capital.</p>
<p>(2) Domestic and Foreign Exchange Rates</p>
<p>Last week, the base exchange rate remained unchanged, but the price of exchange certificates continued to rise under the influence of external factors, reaching 620,000 at one point on Friday, although the volume of transactions was small. The Hong Kong exchange rate continued to narrow, with 100,000 legal tender equal to 41 cents Hong Kong on Monday, and narrowing to 39 cents from Tuesday to Thursday. The price of gold in Hong Kong decreased from 331.5 Hong Kong dollars per tael on Monday to 329 Hong Kong dollars on Thursday. The market price of US dollars was generally between 5.54 and 5.55.</p>
<p>Domestic exchange rates in Shanghai generally increased last week. The exchange rate for Guangzhou was only 80 yuan at the end of the previous week, but rose to 120 yuan on Monday and continued to rise to 150 yuan from Tuesday to Friday, further intensifying the flow of capital to the South. The exchange rate for Xiamen was 120 yuan from Monday to Thursday, and then decreased to 100 yuan on Friday. The exchange rate for Hankou also increased, starting at 30 yuan on Monday and rising to 60 yuan on Thursday, before slightly decreasing to 50 yuan on Friday. The exchange rate for Chongqing was a discount of 20 yuan before Wednesday, but changed to a premium of 20 yuan on Thursday and Friday. Although the exchange rate for Tianjin was generally stable at a discount of 50 yuan before Thursday, the discount suddenly doubled to 100 yuan on Friday, indicating a renewed trend of capital flowing from North to South.</p>
<p>(3) Chinese and Foreign Stock Markets</p>
<p>At the beginning of the week, speculative capital poured in from other cities, and the increasing popularity of commercial drafts led to loose credit conditions. External factors and commodity prices both experienced rapid increases, and the general sentiment was optimistic. The Chinese stock market was no exception, with Wing On cotton yarn briefly reaching 3,390 yuan before large investors sold off to realize profits, bringing the closing price back down to 3,150 yuan. China Cement soared due to special positive news. On Tuesday, credit conditions remained loose, and rumors of easing industrial and commercial loans excited investors. Wing On cotton yarn set a high of 3,440 yuan. Most stocks rose, and the volume of transactions was quite strong. On Wednesday, even more speculative capital gathered in Shanghai, and external factors became even stronger. The Chinese stock market rose even more sharply, with Wing On cotton yarn breaking through the 3,600 yuan mark. China Cement, China Trust, and China Silk all reached their price limits. Stocks that did not reach their price limits also increased by half, and the volume of transactions increased sharply. On Thursday, Wing On cotton yarn initially continued the upward momentum of the previous few days, briefly soaring to a new high of 3,710 yuan, but individual investors were unstable and sold off to realize profits, bringing the price down to the 3,500 yuan mark. China Trust was at 1,130 yuan, New Light at 42 yuan, and Jingfu at only 21.1 yuan. On Friday, the Chinese stock market showed its beauty again on the Dragon Boat Festival. High prices were frequently seen for Wing On cotton yarn, which surged to a new high of 3,815 yuan. Other stocks also rose, with 15 stocks reaching their price limits, including Datong, Rongfeng, New Light, Jingfu, Jinglun, Dongxing, Mei Ya, Zhongxing, Xinyi, Matches, Huafeng, China Cement, China France, Xinhua, and China Merchants, all seemingly celebrating the holiday. On the weekend, Wing On cotton yarn stabilized after rising too sharply in recent days, while many small and medium-sized stocks gained momentum and followed the upward trend.</p>
<p>At the beginning of the week, the Hong Kong exchange rate contracted, the black market was chaotic, and investors were active, vying to buy stocks. All stocks rose across the board, but after the authorities signaled serious pressure, prices fell slightly. Ewo cotton yarn closed at 5.2 million yuan, British American Land was bid at 6.2 million yuan, and Wheelock Marden was at 12 million yuan. On Tuesday, due to extremely loose credit conditions, stocks rose again. Wheelock Marden rose by 1 million compared to the previous day, British American Land rose by 100,000, and Ewo cotton yarn rose by 350,000. On Wednesday, the black market rose even more sharply, credit conditions were extremely loose, and investor sentiment became even more excited. All stocks rose, with Ewo cotton yarn rising the most, reaching 5.75 million yuan. British American Land was at 6.55 million yuan, and Wheelock Marden was at 13.2 million yuan. On Thursday, the Hong Kong exchange rate continued to contract, and the black market rose significantly. However, due to the phenomenon of capital flowing out of the Hong Kong stock market, both buyers and sellers adopted a wait-and-see approach, and the market trended weaker. Ewo cotton yarn fell to 5.62 million, British American Land was at 6.53 million, and Wheelock Marden rose to 13.7 million. On Friday, investor sentiment remained cautious, and trading was thin. The trend was mixed. Wheelock Marden was at 14 million, Ewo cotton yarn rose to 5.83 million, and British American Land was at 6.7 million. On the weekend, due to new high prices for various external commodities, foreign stocks also mostly reached new highs. Ewo cotton yarn closed at 6 million yuan in the afternoon, British American Land was at 6.9 million yuan, and Wheelock Marden was at 15 million yuan.</p>
<h3>Industrial and Commercial Developments</h3>
<p>The Test of the New Foreign Exchange Regulations</p>
<p>Since the promulgation of the new foreign exchange regulations, the reactions have been mixed, but the implementation techniques of the new regulations have not been thoroughly improved to date. In addition, changes in other economic factors caused by the promulgation of the new regulations, such as rising domestic prices of export goods, falling foreign prices, and the continued rise in black market foreign exchange prices, have greatly reduced the possibility of the new system's success. The new threats to the industrial and commercial sectors posed by the new foreign exchange regulations over the past week are listed below:</p>
<p>(1) According to the person in charge of the China Cotton Textile Production and Sales Joint Company, although the new exchange settlement method has been implemented, cotton textiles have not yet been exported. The reason is that the market price of exchange settlement certificates is too low, and the few transactions conducted by major banks cannot be considered representative. China's cotton textile market in the South Pacific Islands is also about to be seized by Japan, so it will be even more difficult to export cotton textiles in the future.</p>
<p>(2) According to sources from the sausage casing exporters, after the promulgation of the exchange settlement certificate method, domestic sausage casing prices have risen by 130,000 to 150,000 yuan per set. However, the US market price, calculated using the exchange settlement certificate price, is only 120,000 to 130,000 yuan per set, so sausage casing exports remain as difficult as before.</p>
<p>(3) According to a tung oil exporter, tung oil has not yet been exported recently, because the difference between the exchange settlement certificate price and the black market price is as high as 60%. Currently, tung oil in the New York market is 24 cents per pound, equivalent to 21 cents for delivery at the Shanghai dock. Calculated using the market price of exchange settlement certificates, each dan (unit of weight) is worth 21 million yuan, but the current market price in Shanghai is already 20.5 million yuan, so its export remains difficult. In addition, according to China Trust Bureau (CTB) sources, US importers are expected to compete to sell their inventories of tung oil, and the US government plans to auction 1,600 tons of tung oil purchased from American tung tree farmers in the near future, which will also have a significant impact on our tung oil sales.</p>
<p>(4) Regarding hog bristle exports, according to CTB sources, the foreign hog bristle market has also been disrupted by the new foreign exchange regulations. Although there are many domestic sellers seeking to sell, foreign buyers are not making counter-offers. The market conditions are the same as the previous week, but there are transactions without trade (行無市).</p>
<p>(5) The issue of foreign exchange settlement for public utilities due to the new foreign exchange regulations, although senators have petitioned in Beijing, requesting the authorities to settle foreign exchange at the Central Bank's exchange rate. However, according to the Ta Kung Pao, the new price adjustment date for water, electricity, gas, and telephone services has been delayed for a long time due to the excessive losses of each company. Therefore, the municipal government is considering restoring additional methods and may collect additional fees from June 6th. It seems that public utilities are facing another price increase.</p>
<p>(6) Originally, one of the purposes of the new foreign exchange regulations was to base imports on the foreign exchange earned from exports. However, as mentioned above, whether exports can be promoted is a major issue, so the so-called easing of imports of production equipment is just a pipe dream. For example, the Import-Export Management Committee (輸管會) held a meeting on the 10th to discuss the import of production equipment listed in Schedule I, but it is said that "due to foreign exchange difficulties, no concrete decisions have been made." Previously, some people viewed the new foreign exchange regulations as having a "linked import and export" spirit, but the current facts prove that imports and exports are still in a "disconnected" situation.</p>
<p>(7) Another example of the insufficient foreign exchange and the failure of the new foreign exchange regulations to link import and export trade is fully revealed in the recent fuel oil panic. According to reports, Mobil and other three foreign oil companies in Shanghai jointly notified China Central and Civil Air Transport that they would stop supplying gasoline from the 6th because the Import-Export Management Committee had not approved the quota for the three companies to supply aviation fuel to China Central and Civil Air Transport. The Import-Export Management Committee then approved a quota of US$250,000 for the three companies to supply aviation fuel to civil aviation on the 4th, but it is said that this amount can only last for one month. The three oil companies also suddenly notified China Central and Civil Air Transport on Tuesday, citing the exchange settlement certificate, that the oil price would increase by 80%, and the crisis in civil air transport is also on the rise. In addition, the fuel exchange settlement issue of the Shipping Association has not been resolved. Although it is said that the authorities have removed this oil class from the import quota allocation for the fifth and sixth seasons because the US aid has listed diesel, gasoline, and other fuel oils, it is not difficult to see the embarrassment of the authorities due to the shortage of foreign exchange. If US aid is still delayed or repeatedly reduced, the critical situation will be difficult to sustain!</p>
<p>(8) Increasing overseas remittances is probably one of the positive goals of the new foreign exchange regulations, but according to reports, although remittances from overseas Chinese are expected to increase slightly due to the promulgation of the new system, the difference between the black market and the exchange rate obtained through the exchange settlement method is still large, and the procedures are also difficult, so the prospects for attracting overseas remittances are still not optimistic.</p>
<p>Whether the new foreign exchange regulations can be successful is still difficult to say with certainty, but whether it can withstand a series of real-world tests is gradually becoming apparent. Undoubtedly, the new regulations will go through the years it should have, just like the old regulations, but the length of time a "regulation" is implemented is not the standard for its success or failure. From a local perspective or in terms of the interests of a certain group of people, this is a relatively successful "regulation," so it has been delayed for some time. However, from an overall and long-term perspective, the same "regulation" may well be the prelude to greater chaos and greater difficulties. At present, the main principles can be said to be set, and under the unchanged principles, we must find some remedies that treat the symptom but not the cause. Although it is often welcomed by some "non-high-profile" or so-called "technical experts, the phenomenon of "treating the head but the foot hurts" will inevitably occur. Not only that, with the passage of time and the changes in social conditions, if the second "headache and foot pain" is more extensive and severe than the first, how can the evaluation of the first treatment be considered a success!</p>

<h3>Representatives of Overseas Chinese Schools Urge Concessions: Present Four Requests to Siam; Detailed Answers Provided by Siamese Deputy Minister of Education</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Bangkok, 12th] The Chinese Embassy in Siam presented a new note to the Siamese Ministry of Foreign Affairs on the 12th, seeking a reasonable resolution to the current issue of overseas Chinese schools. Meanwhile, representatives of the teachers of the overseas Chinese schools once again appealed to the Siamese Ministry of Education for concessions. The four requests presented by the representatives were given detailed answers by the Siamese Deputy Minister of Education, Nai Sukdi. The details are recorded below: The first request claimed that schools teaching Chinese are different from other private schools, and we request special treatment. The Siamese Ministry of Education replied: This Ministry's policies do not discriminate against private schools of any country or ethnicity, and all such private schools are established under the same laws. The second request concerned the agreement signed between the former Thamrong government and the Chinese Embassy. The Ministry of Education replied: This agreement is currently being implemented accurately and practically. Overseas Chinese themselves have some misunderstandings because their demands far exceed what they should enjoy under the agreement. "Article 6 of the Sino-Siamese Friendship Treaty clearly stipulates that nationals of both contracting parties may, in compliance with the laws and regulations of the country where they are located, establish schools to educate their children and enjoy freedom of assembly, association, publication, and religious belief." At the same time, the Siamese side strongly emphasized the phrase "compliance with the laws and regulations of the country where they are located." The third request was why overseas Chinese schools are not allowed to enroll students aged eight to fifteen. The Siamese Deputy Minister of Education replied: Overseas Chinese schools will be allowed to enroll such students after complying with the regulations of the Private Schools Act. The fourth request was that the Siamese Ministry of Education should recognize teachers of overseas Chinese schools who lost their wartime certificates. The Siamese Deputy Minister of Education replied: The Siamese Ministry of Education cannot take action based on rumors. In any case, a remedy for this problem already exists. "The Siamese Ministry of Education believes that all rumors about the loss of wartime teacher certificates are just rumors. Any qualified teacher can apply for a re-examination to prove their qualifications. Anyone can use this convenience. In fact, only a few teachers can pass the examination because the examination has strict standards for Siamese language proficiency." The inability of students aged eight to fifteen to enroll and the lack of a sufficient number of teachers are the direct factors that all overseas Chinese schools in Siam need to suspend classes.</p>
<h3>China Education Society Regularly Selects Honorary Teacher Candidates; China Education Research Association Provides Key Points for Improvement</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] The Shanghai Branch of the China Education Society will hold a meeting of directors and supervisors at the Kindergarten Teachers College at 3:00 PM on the 18th to select three honorary teacher candidates from among its members to be reported to the General Association. After review by the General Association, nominations will be made to the Joint Association of Chinese Educational Academic Organizations.</p>
<p>[Another Report] The Committee for the Study of Secondary Education of the China Education Society successfully closed on the 12th. In addition to a detailed written report published in the fourth issue of the China Education Society's Newsletter on various issues related to secondary education and further research, the committee specifically provided the following key points for improvement: (A) Issues of Secondary School Functions: (1) Secondary schools must be differentiated; single-subject secondary schools cannot meet the individual needs of young people and the needs of society. (2) The method of differentiation should not be rigidly stipulated by the educational administrative authorities. Secondary education experts in various regions should conduct detailed research and experiments. Once results are available, they should be made public to society for adoption. (B) Vocational Education Issues at the Secondary Education Stage: (1) The government should find ways to closely integrate vocational education with productive enterprises. (2) Equal importance should be attached to both supplementary vocational schools and formal vocational schools. (3) The implementation of vocational guidance should be strengthened. (4) Improvements to the content of vocational education should start from the curriculum, teaching materials, teachers, teaching methods, and practical training. (C) Issues of Articulation between Secondary Schools and Universities: (1) High school and university teachers should establish contact with each other. (2) University entrance examination questions should effectively comply with the current secondary school curriculum standards. (3) High schools should strengthen college counseling, and universities should implement freshman orientation. (D) Improving the Quality of Secondary Education Teachers: (1) The current system of advanced normal education must be improved in a planned way. (2) To solve the teacher shortage, we should start by increasing salaries, stabilizing livelihoods, and guaranteeing employment. (3) In-service teacher training should be encouraged in many ways. Higher education institutions, especially normal colleges, should open up opportunities for further study. Educational administrative authorities should set up resolutions and have strict negotiations with international cultural institutions to implement overseas study. (E) Issues of Life Training for Middle School Students: (1) Actively promote the excellent moral character of middle school teachers. (2) The homeroom teacher system must be strengthened. Larger-scale middle schools may use a permanent homeroom teacher system. (3) Effectively improve the healthy lives of young people. (4) Pay attention to the normal development of young people's emotional lives and social behavior. (5) Strengthen the implementation of systematic extracurricular activities to cultivate young people's excellent character. (F) Strengthening the Administrative Efficiency of Secondary Education in Provinces and Cities: (1) Policies should not be changed easily. (2) Establish a reasonable personnel system and implement it effectively (including selection, recruitment, appointment, treatment, training, etc.). (3) Simplify administrative procedures. (4) Administrative authorities should provide more active guidance and less passive restrictions to the schools under their jurisdiction.</p>
<h3>Education Society Welcomes Legislators</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper, Nanjing] The Nanjing Branch of the China Education Society recently held its sixth membership meeting at the National Central University Alumni Association in Sipaillou, Nanjing. It welcomed the newly elected members of the Legislative Yuan and bid farewell to member Cheng Qibao, who was attending international education conferences and lecturing and inspecting. Members of the Legislative Yuan Hu Shuhua, Cheng Tianfang, Li Zheng, Cheng Qibao, Huang Linshu, Xiang Jutan, Ni Wenya, Chen Jitang, Meng Yunqiao, Huang Jianzhong, and members Zhu Muzun, Gu Yiqiao, Zhao Naibo, Zhang Liuquan, Wang Jingqing, Chen Dongyuan, Liu Jihong, Hu Jiajian, and more than sixty others attended. Chairman Luo Tingguang first delivered a welcome speech. Then Cheng Shizhi and Yuan Boqiao reported on the recent situation of the General Association. Subsequently, the legislators spoke one after another.</p>
<p>Hu Shuhua's Speech: Hu Shuhua said: He has been involved in education for more than ten years and deeply feels that education can only be successful when it is coordinated with politics and economics. Therefore, he came to the Legislative Yuan and raised two issues for discussion regarding current education: (1) There is a contradictory phenomenon in today's education. There are many candidates, but few are admitted. Therefore, some say that there are too few universities, but judging from the national education funding and the lack of teachers, there are actually too many universities. How should this problem be solved? Emphasis on quality or quantity? He advocates emphasizing quality and enriching the existing university facilities before considering further expansion. (2) The issue of students' career paths: The government cannot find jobs for graduates. It would be better to run more normal schools and vocational schools in middle schools, which can guarantee students' career paths.</p>
<p>Cheng Tianfang's Speech: Cheng Tianfang hoped that the Education Society and the legislators would maintain more contact. The legislators are representatives of the people, and the Legislative Yuan should reflect public opinion. In the past, all levels of public opinion institutions were disconnected from the people, while British and American parliamentarians often maintained contact with the people. Voters should communicate with parliamentarians and ask them to introduce various bills in the parliament. Parliamentarians can only obey the Chinese people. Most of the people are not concerned about national affairs because their education level is too low, which further increases the responsibility of intellectuals. In the future, the Legislative Yuan must establish contact with the intellectual class, and education colleagues are the backbone of the intellectuals. He hopes for regular communication and welcomes opinions on various issues. Secondly, education colleagues have a major mission under the current circumstances. Because political corruption and financial chaos inevitably foster a pessimistic and disappointed mentality, and emotions of arrogance and boredom follow, everyone is speculative and short-sighted, only caring about their own interests and not paying attention to national crises. This phenomenon requires the correction of education workers. Since we are engaged in education, we are certainly not afraid of difficulties and believe that we will be able to complete the mission.</p>
<p>Li Yunting's Speech: Li Yunting said: The Legislative Yuan is about to review the budget for the second half of the year. More than one hundred legislators in the Cultural Education Committee are participating, accounting for one-sixth of all legislators. They are determined to realize the 15% proportion of education funding stipulated by the Constitution. He hoped that the Education Society would provide the necessary reference materials for striving for this goal. Secondly, education workers should try to maintain the pure spirit of students and not be assimilated by society. For example, the corrupt officials of today were also pure students twenty or thirty years ago. These people are about to die and are not to be feared. He hopes that each generation will be better than the last.</p>
<p>Other legislators, Meng Yunqiao, Ni Wenya, Xiang Jutan, and Huang Jianzhong, were successively invited to speak. Cheng Qibao reported that he was scheduled to depart from Shanghai on the 10th, first to the UNESCO organization in Paris, where he would stay for two weeks to establish working contacts. After the meeting, he would go to the UK and the US to study education and return to China in about three months. Then Gu Yiqiao expressed his opinions on education funding. Finally, Zhao Jiuchuan summarized everyone's speeches. After several hours, the hosts and guests dispersed happily.</p>
<h3>The Predicament of Studying Abroad is Not True: Ministry of Education Issues Statement</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper, Nanjing, 13th] It has been rumored that Chinese students in the United States who have been admitted to universities are in dire straits recently, especially those who are studying in the United States on government scholarships. Regarding this matter, according to officials in charge of the Ministry of Education: The Ministry has a total of 72 government-sponsored students studying in the United States, including 40 in the 33rd year and 32 in the 35th year. Among them, the government-sponsored students of the 33rd year had their government scholarships interrupted for a short period due to the settlement of foreign exchange, but all the expenses required by these students have been remitted on March 6 this year. The expenses of the government-sponsored students of the 35th year have not been interrupted, and there is no situation of financial hardship. As for self-funded students studying in the United States: (1) Those who are admitted can settle foreign exchange at the official rate according to regulations; (2) Scholarship students who meet the regulations can settle the differential foreign exchange, and those who do not meet the regulations cannot settle the differential foreign exchange. The amount insufficient for the scholarship must be planned by themselves; (3) For other students who provide their own foreign exchange, the documents of their foreign exchange source have been carefully reviewed by the Ministry before going abroad. The expenses of self-funded students approved by the Ministry should not be a problem.</p>

<h3>The Library of Congress of the United States Collects Our Rare Books: A Total of 1,600 Types of Song and Yuan Imprints; Peking University Publishing Department Undertakes Printing of the Catalog</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Beiping, 13th] The Peking University Publishing Department is undertaking the printing of the catalog of rare books in the Library of Congress of the United States, which is the most noteworthy news in the academic community. Professor Wang Chongmin, director of the Special Collections Department of the Peking University Library, told reporters on the 12th: The Library of Congress of the United States has a collection of as many as 1,622 kinds of rare ancient Chinese books, including ten Song imprints, Buddhist scriptures from the Leifeng Pagoda printed in the eighth year of the Kaibao reign of Emperor Taizu of Song (975 AD), and twelve Yuan imprints. The Jin imprints that our scholars call the Jin imprints are also included. There are 1,422 kinds of Ming imprints, including 72 kinds of vermilion ink prints. There are 58 kinds of early Qing imprints, mostly banned books or Ming annotations. There are also 120 kinds of manuscripts, including nine Dunhuang manuscripts. Wang also said: The 5,000 kinds of rare books collected by the Peking University Library are the best in our country. The Jiangsu National Academy Library has 2,548 kinds, and the Palace Museum Library has 1,025 kinds. Therefore, the collection of the Library of Congress of the United States ranks third in the world. However, the current Central Library has advanced to the second place. This time, compiling and printing the catalog of rare books for the Library of Congress of the United States is also the beginning of international cultural cooperation. Now that Bei Huo is undertaking the printing, it will be published in two months, and its printing art will surely win the attention of foreign countries. He also said: Americans have recently been buying up rare copies in Beijing, which is worth paying attention to. Our country should find ways to preserve rare copies. The cultural institutions should guide the Book Industry Association to sell the popular Ming imprints on the market to foreigners as a medium for cultural communication.</p>

<h3>Shanghai University Negotiates to Purchase Vacant Land; Limited to More Than 100,000 US Dollars</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] Because the construction of Shanghai University has increased repeatedly, the vacant land is decreasing day by day, and the land to the south is owned by the Air Force, the proposal for expansion cannot be realized. Now the school is negotiating to purchase the vacant land to the north. The land is 300 to 400 acres in total. If the purchase is successful, the entire construction plan can be gradually started. According to Principal Ling Xianyang, the American Church allocated 350,000 US dollars last summer to purchase 400 acres of vacant land to the south. Later, 200,000 US dollars was used to build a girls' dormitory.

<p>Mayor's Cup Football Final Dispute (Top) Police Protect Referee Jiang Yinseng Leaving the Field (Bottom) A Tense Moment in the Game (Photo by China News Agency)</p>
<h3>Bad Habit of Beating Referees Difficult to Change: Another Dispute in the Mayor's Cup; Qingbai Maintains Championship; Wins East China Two to One</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] The three-time Mayor's Cup football final, which had been undecided for a long time, was finally held yesterday at 4:00 PM. The two heroes of East China met again. There were about 8,000 spectators in Yiyuan Stadium. As a result of the fierce battle, Qingbai won by a narrow margin of two to one and retained the Mayor's Cup championship. Fifteen minutes after the start of the game, heavy rain poured down. Spectators and players stood upright in the rain, which was commendable. Unfortunately, when the game reached 25 minutes in the second half, Shuanghua was at a disadvantage of one to two. Sure enough, as expected by the referee association, another strange drama of assaulting and insulting the referee occurred. Donghua's Han Nibo slapped referee Jiang Yinseng hard, causing chaos in the football stadium and the game was suspended. Later, Shen Huichun made a cameo appearance to continue officiating, and the game was able to end. Sportsmanship, however, no longer exists, which is deeply regrettable.</p>
<p>East China Scores First, Gains the Upper Hand: The game started at 4:04 PM. The referee was Jiang Yinseng, and the linesmen were Lu Shunde and Li Guoyi. Qingbai's attack was better than its defense. The young forwards were exceptionally sharp. Although East China had many veterans, they were busy coping with the attacks, which was the divergence point of yesterday's game. The rising stars have promising futures. Within five minutes of Qingbai's appearance, the offensive was fierce, but it did not achieve anything. At seven minutes, Han Nibo crossed the ball from the side, and Chen Mingzhe dribbled the ball and rushed forward. Zhang Renyi actually lost his footing. Mingzhe shot hard, and Qin Bigao thought it was out of bounds, but the ball touched the goal post and bounced in. East China took the lead one to zero.</p>
<p>Heavy Rain Pours Down, Each Scores a Tie: At this time, heavy rain suddenly fell. The audience gathered together, and the players fought in the rain. However, the leather ball was wet and surprisingly heavy, and the ground was slippery. The players fell one after another, and the game lost a lot of its excitement. At 22 minutes, Jin Lusheng passed to Xiao Luo, who dribbled the ball directly to the front of the goal. Lin Gen kicked it into a corner kick. Jin took the corner kick, and Xiao Gu headed it out diagonally. Qingbai's five forwards advanced, and Xiao Gao shot near the goal. Chen Huimin caught it and dropped it again. Xiao Gao flew in and rushed into the net, tying the score. The East China people were angry about the goal, thinking that Xiao Gao had already been offside, and protested to the referee on the spot. The first half ended with a one-to-one tie.</p>
<p>Qingbai Takes the Lead, A Fiery Performance: In the second half, Yu Qiaoxing retired, and Jin Chuanhan replaced him. The two sides attacked and defended each other, holding on for 15 minutes. Youliang committed a foul. Xiao Fei took a free kick 30 yards away and shot directly into the net. Chen Huimin played the pipa and settled the ball, but lost it again. The score was two to one, and Qingbai was at a disadvantage. The city of China lost two cities in a row, and was unwilling. Their emotions were tense, and they committed fouls. There was a fiery performance on both sides.</p>
<p>Beating the Referee, Another Strange Drama: At 25 minutes, Xiao Gu and Chen Jiawan collided with each other. Jiang Yinseng penalized East China. Han Nibo stepped forward to question and slapped the referee hard, causing a dispute. The game was suspended as a result. After mediation by the parties involved, Jiang Yinseng resigned, and Shen Huichun, as a staff member of the Football Committee, made a cameo appearance to enforce the law and continue the game. However, after this change, both sides were unwilling to fight. The silver whistle sounded for a long time, and East China was defeated by one to two. East China stated that it had not reached the legal time and stopped the war abruptly, and planned to file another protest.</p>

In less than a minute, Jingwu's left winger Fang Renqiu scored, making it 1-0. Li Rongbang scored again, and Jingwu took the lead 2-0 in the first half. After changing sides to fight again, Qunli was enthusiastic and promising. Yu Zhenyue broke in and made it 2-1. They then won two 12-yard penalties in a row, taking the lead 3-2.

<p>"In the Mayor's Cup football final between East China and Qingbai on the 13th, East China player Han Nibo did not comply with referee Jiang Yinseng's decision and beat the referee on the spot. He was immediately penalized and left the field. Then the team captain declared to the referee that the East China team voluntarily forfeited the game. However, in order to cope with the situation at the time, the remaining game time was refereed by Shen Huichun, an employee of the Association, to continue the unofficial game until the end."</p>
<h3>Letter from Tunghua Expressing Protest</h3>
<p>"To the Esteemed Editor,</p>
<p>Regarding the Municipal Cup Final between our team and the Qingbai team on the 13th of this month, due to the referee's inappropriate handling of Qingbai team's first goal, our team captain, Li Yao, immediately protested to the referee. The referee granted the right to reserve the protest. Considering that many spectators outside the field may not fully understand the truth about the dispute that occurred on that day, the facts of the dispute are listed as follows:</p>
<p>(1) When Qingbai scored the first goal, Gao Xiuqing and Gu Yisa had already been offside. The referee, Jiang Yineng, immediately ruled it offside. However, the linesman, Lu Shunde, indicated to the referee that the goal should count. The referee suddenly made a mistake and changed the ruling to "goal" temporarily. Immediately, our team captain, Li Yao, protested to the referee, arguing that since the referee had already ruled it offside, he should not change his decision temporarily. The referee also granted our team the right to reserve the protest, and then the game continued.</p>
<p>(2) In the second half, Gu Yisa of the Qingbai team bumped into Chen Jiawan. The referee instead ruled that Chen committed a foul. Immediately, our team's Han Nibo stepped forward to explain to the referee. The referee, Jiang Yineng, used foul language in English, insulting Han Nibo. Mr. Han argued that in football matches, referees never use foul language to scold players, thus causing a dispute.</p>
<p>(3) The referee refused to officiate and left the field. Since our team's right to protest had been granted by the referee, we waited quietly for the referee to be mediated and be able to return to the field to perform his duties. Eventually, Mr. Shen Huichun took over as the referee. Mr. Shen also said, "Jiang Yineng is unwilling to be the referee, so I will continue to avoid disturbances from the audience." Tunghua can also protest against having two referees in one game.</p>
<p>When Mr. Shen Huichun was officiating, it was 5:25 pm. However, the whistle was blown to end the game at 5:35 pm. Immediately, our team captain, Li Yao, asked Mr. Shen Huichun how long the game had been played. Mr. Shen replied that it was now 5:35 pm. Considering that the second half started at 5:00 pm, even if the time consumed by disputes was included, it should have ended at least at 5:45 pm. The result of a game that has not met the legal time cannot be considered an official score. Therefore, in addition to protesting to the Football Committee, our team has detailed the situation as above and requests that your newspaper kindly publish it. Respectfully submitted by the Tunghua Football Club."</p>

<h3>New Uses for Ultrasound</h3>
<p>— Qianghua</p>
<p>If the vibration of a sound wave exceeds 16,000 times per second, it cannot be heard by the human ear. However, the progress of science in today's world has enabled humans to create ultrasound with a vibration rate of up to 12 million times per second. Moreover, in industry, agriculture, military affairs, medicine, meteorology, and even daily life applications, people are experimenting with using this ultrasound that humans cannot hear for various new applications.</p>
<p>We know that modern industry lacks effective and economical methods for inspecting the internal structural integrity of large sand-casted products. However, it is now possible to use sound waves with a vibration rate of over one million times per second to identify hidden flaws in large metal castings. Professor Floyd Firestone of the University of Michigan discovered that when a perfect metal casting is inspected with ultrasound, there is an echo on the opposite side of the metal. This echo can be received and even amplified. However, if there are flaws inside the metal casting, the echo is fastest at the flaw. Therefore, the location of internal flaws can be determined from the speed of the echo. Using this method, large castings up to ten feet thick can be inspected. Today, many famous factories in the United States have widely adopted this method to inspect the quality of propeller shafts for warships or ships and steel axles for train locomotives.</p>
<p>It takes about half an hour to disinfect milk using heat. Dr. A.J. Salle, a bacteriologist at the University of California, has proven that high-frequency sound can complete the disinfection of milk in a few seconds. Many dairy farms now use ultrasound to homogenize milk and kill bacteria in milk. When milk flows through a steel baffle that emits ultrasonic vibrations, the fat breaks down into smaller spheres. As a result, the clumps of milk that coagulate in the stomach are also smaller, making it easier to digest. Doctors believe that this homogenized milk is more suitable for infants.</p>
<p>Food disinfection is one of the major goals of a group of pioneering acoustic engineers. In laboratory tests, sound waves reduced the number of bacteria in each cubic centimeter of milk to eight. In fact, the highest standard of purity for disinfected milk is that each cubic centimeter of milk should not exceed 30,000 bacteria. Sound waves can almost completely eliminate the bacteria in milk, allowing the milk to be stored for several days without spoiling.</p>
<p>The power of sound has also been used to make mayonnaise, peanut butter, creams, dyes, and medicines more uniformly and permanently blended. In the future, the mixers used in the kitchen will only need to hit an F key to make a lattice cake without coarse particles.</p>
<p>The Ultrasound Research Association of Cambridge, Massachusetts, and the U.S. Navy are planning to eliminate fog over airports by using sound waves to turn it into rain. In a large glass tank in a Cambridge laboratory, filled with artificial fog, high-frequency sound waves eliminate it in one second. Not long ago, an outdoor experiment was conducted in Arcata, California. However, the strong wind blew the fog away, and the ultrasound did not have time to work. A larger ultrasonic emitter is now being manufactured for further testing.</p>
<p>It is said that Soviet scientists use ultrasound to stimulate the seeds of plants, greatly increasing yields. The results of research by S.L. Ward of the Chrysler Research Experimental Factory revealed that potatoes treated with ultrasound flowered one week earlier than untreated ones, and yields increased by 40% to 50%. Treated peas also sprouted earlier, and some yields were more than three times higher than normal.</p>
<p>Ward handed over the research equipment to Dr. Raymond H. Wallace, a botanist at the University of Connecticut, for further experimentation. In the past two years, Dr. Wallace's research results have been excellent, and in the future, it will definitely be of great benefit to increasing the world's food supply.</p>
<p>Sir Edward Appleton, Director of the British Department of Scientific and Industrial Research, is studying the use of ultrasonic vibrations to shake dirt off clothes and into soapy water. An inventor in Chicago has applied for a patent for his invention of an ultrasonic vacuum cleaner. This device can cause carpets to resonate and vibrate, forcing dust to fall naturally, creating a washing effect.</p>
<p>The American Ultrasound Research Association has created a powerful sound emitter. Its vibrations, from the number of times that human ears can hear to 200,000 vibrations per second, can be felt hundreds of feet away. Standing within its power circle, you don't feel the movement of the air, but you may feel a sense of "impending doom" and may feel sick.</p>
<p>In a large factory that manufactures carbon black, a special sound emitter is installed in the chimney. The vibration of the sound waves causes the carbon particles to collide with each other and form into snowball-like clumps that fall down. Therefore, the carbon particles are not wasted by flying outside. This type of device is also installed in chemical factories to contain odors and prevent the countryside from being harmed. The U.S. Bureau of Casting is studying its use to reduce the damage caused by soot particles in cities.</p>
<p>The aging of alcoholic beverages is due to the collision of certain molecules in the alcohol, and ultrasound can increase the number of collisions. Last winter, the Ultrasound Research Association vibrated newly brewed French wine with ultrasound for a few minutes, and its taste was like that of fine, aged whiskey. Chemical analysis proved that it was the same as wine that had been aged for four years.</p>
<p>Scientists are already imagining using ultrasound to kill or maim people. During the recent war, records of experimental ultrasound killings were found in the city of Lofer, Austria: sound waves that could be heard by humans were regularly emitted through a gas in a whistle-like metal tube, and then focused on the target through a large parabolic reflector. Although the actual battlefield application has not been tested, it is estimated that this method can kill people within 60 meters in 30 to 40 seconds, or maim them within 300 meters. Military authorities are quite concerned that using sound waves to kill people will be one of the terrifying weapons in future world wars.</p>
<p>Medical researchers are also using ultrasound. Drs. John G. Lyon and Tracy J. Patnam of the Columbia University Department of Neurology have used ultrasound to perform brain surgery on 37 cats, dogs, and monkeys without having to break open the skull. The method of application is to reflect sound waves vibrating 800,000 times per second to a certain spot using a curved crystal reflector. Scientists have discovered that they can temporarily excite or destroy a point in a certain selected brain tissue. This work is still in the experimental stage, but it may lead to a type of brain surgery that does not require surgery in the future.</p>
<p>Ultrasonics is still a very new science, and its future development is limitless. Scientists are now only reaching the edge of this new field. They will surely continue to work hard to develop this vast new land for the benefit of mankind.</p>
<h3>New Scientific Weapons</h3>
<p>— Liang</p>
<p>Seawater Battery</p>
<p>During World War II, the seawater battery could also be said to be one of the important inventions. This type of battery generates electricity by using seawater. This battery is placed in a small buoy. When needed, simply pull out the mast-shaped antenna and throw it into the sea. It will then immediately emit automatic radio waves. These radio waves can be detected within a radius of 50 nautical miles. Because when this battery enters seawater, it starts to work. With the help of a vibrator, it can generate a voltage of 330 volts and continuously broadcast radio signals for up to 12 hours.</p>
<p>During World War II, many aviators who crashed into the sea due to aircraft damage were rescued by using this device.</p>
<p>Radio-Guided Missiles</p>
<p>It can now be predicted that the flying altitude of bombers in the future will be beyond the range of anti-aircraft guns, so it is impossible to use anti-aircraft fire to shoot down high-altitude aircraft. It is also difficult to use destroyers to attack groups of bombers, because the bomber fleets must have strict protection and mutual defense against external attacks, making it difficult for attacking aircraft to seize the opportunity to enter. Therefore, in order to solve this problem, many scientists and weapons experts at the U.S. Abode Weapons Research Institute planned a projectile weapon using radio engines, loaded with powerful explosives, to break into the enemy's aircraft formation and suddenly explode violently, causing serious damage to the enemy.</p>
<p>If the enemy aircraft formation is afraid of this sharp weapon, they will inevitably disperse their formation and fly separately. At this time, this group of aircraft is a good target for destroyers, because the destroyers can smoothly attack the enemy aircraft at this time. (To be continued)</p>
<h3>The Hairy-Faced Man</h3>
<p>— Chongxi</p>
<p>I was quite interested in reading the "Oddities of Ancient and Modern Times" drawing title on page 2 of this newspaper on the 7th of this month, which mentioned "Li Baoshan, a man from Wucheng, Shandong, with a full face of hair, indistinguishable sideburns and eyebrows..." Regarding the facts about this hairy-faced man, Mr. Li, I have been continuously interviewing for more than ten years. I obtained a half-body portrait of Mr. Li in Qingdao (as shown in the left picture) and, based on the information obtained, wrote a short English paper, which was published in the German Journal of Ethnology (Zeitschrift fur Rassenkunde) in the second issue of Volume 6 in 1937, which attracted the attention of anthropologists. Later, with the help of Mr. Xing Zhaojun, a friend from Yenching University in Peiping, I obtained a full-body photo of Mr. Li and photos of his parents. Mr. Xing and Mr. Li grew up in the same village and were childhood friends, so he knew the matter in great detail. Mr. Li's parents were rural farmers who made a living selling tofu. They had many sons, all of whom had normal bodies with no peculiarities, except for Mr. Li, who was born with hair all over his body, especially on his head and face. Even after adulthood, it did not diminish. Mr. Li was very lively and intelligent as a child. Due to family poverty, he could not study. The family considered his strange hair to be unlucky, and his peers often teased him. However, it was precisely because of this strange hair that he had no worries about food and clothing throughout his life. In the 28th year [of the Republic], he came to Shanghai to perform, living in a certain hotel across from the Yong'an Company building on Zhejiang Road. Later, in the 31st year [of the Republic], he went to the United States and joined a circus, performing alone and earning a lot of money. The following year, he went to perform in Southeast Asia, taking the President Cleveland out of Shanghai. Because he did not want outsiders to see through him, he wore masks on the ship, but he was eventually discovered by a reporter from the mainland newspaper at the time, and there was a record of an interview in that newspaper. I also described the matter in detail in the "Scientific Pictorial." Many years have passed, and I don't know where he is now. According to a letter from Mr. Xing, Mr. Li's name is Bao Shu, and he is from near Peiping, which is slightly different from what Mr. Shao Fei said in "Oddities of Ancient and Modern Times." I don't know which is correct and leave it for correction. After my English paper was published, Professor R.R. Gates, F.R.S., a famous British human genetics expert, cited it in his recent book "Human Genetics (Humon. Genetecs, Vols. 2 1947)," saying that such cases are extremely rare. Only one case can be encountered in 200 million births, and even fewer can grow to adulthood. According to scientific research, the world record includes a Russian dog-faced man, a Burmese hairy-faced family, and a black hairy-faced woman. During the fetal period, humans have hair all over their bodies for a period of time, which diminishes after that period. Therefore, after a person is born, body hair is not obvious. Mr. Li's full body hair is probably caused by the dysfunction of a certain endocrine gland in the body and cannot be considered a recurrence of atavism. It is even more absurd to say that it is a variant of apes and monkeys.</p>
<h3>On Catalysis</h3>
<p>— Kezhi</p>
<p>Anyone with a little knowledge of science must know about catalysis. Catalysis means that when two things undergo a chemical reaction, if the two things are not easy to change or change very slowly, then if we add a third thing, we can speed up the change. This kind of effect is also called catalysis. This third thing is called a catalyst. It is very strange that the catalyst itself does not undergo any changes at all when it promotes changes. This is truly a miracle in science!</p>
<p>Now, let’s give an example to illustrate catalysis. For example, hydrogen peroxide (hydrogen peroxide) is very easy to decompose into water and oxygen, even at room temperature. If exposed to light or if manganese dioxide (Manganese aioxide) or fine powder of platinum (platinum) is added, the decomposition will be faster. The addition of manganese dioxide platinum powder to make the effect faster is called catalysis, and the powder of manganese dioxide or platinum is called a catalyst, but the added powder of manganese dioxide or platinum does not change.</p>
<p>Hydrogen peroxide sold on the market contains a small amount of organic compounds to prevent the decomposition of hydrogen peroxide, because what we need is hydrogen peroxide, and we do not need water or oxygen. Therefore, organic compounds are used to prevent it from changing. So what do we call these organic compounds? If we say they are catalysts, but catalysts increase the rate of change, we give them another term, which is negative catalysts. From the meaning of catalysts, we can infer the meaning of negative catalysts, which are catalysts that can reduce the rate of change, and are called negative catalysts.</p>
<p>The application of catalysis is very wide, especially in chemical changes, almost all of which use catalysis. Combustible gases mixed with oxygen or air can cause a major disaster if they encounter a small fire. For example, coal mine explosions are caused by marsh gas (methane (CH4)) slowly leaking from the coal and becoming a mixture in the air that explodes when it encounters fire. Hydrogen gas and oxygen mixed together can remain unchanged in a dark place permanently; but if they see a little light, they will slowly synthesize into hydrochloric acid, and if placed in sunlight, they will explode immediately.</p>
<p>Also, if a platinum wire is placed on the mouth of a bottle containing wood alcohol (i.e., alcohol), the alcohol gas will combine with the oxygen in the air through the catalysis of platinum, and the platinum wire will become hot and glow red. Similarly, if there is platinum wool on the mouth of a bottle emitting oxygen, the oxygen will burn. Those who have studied chemistry know that potassium chlorate releases oxygen when heated, but some manganese dioxide is often added to make the change proceed faster. For example, sodium sulfite is easily oxidized to sodium sulfate if there is a very small amount of copper compound present.</p>
<p>The application of catalysis in industry is very important. The manufacture of sulfuric acid by the contact method, the direct synthesis of ammonia from nitrogen and oxygen, and the manufacture of nitric acid and nitrates from ammonia are all achieved through catalysis. If linseed oil is added to paint, the paint will dry easily. This is not because the linseed oil evaporates, but because the linseed oil easily combines with nitrogen. If lead oxide is used as a catalyst to make boiled oil, it will dry easily and quickly. When acetylene gas C2H2 made from calcium carbide is passed into water, it becomes acetaldehyde if sulfuric acid and mercuric sulfate are present in the water. This is a very important thing, from which acetic acid and acetone can be made. If manganese acetate is added to liquid acetaldehyde and oxygen is passed through, acetic acid is obtained. If manganese acetate is not present, there is a great danger, because there is a kind of peracetic acid which is a violent explosive. Manganese acetate can prevent the production of this acetic acid and remain unchanged itself, so the manganese acetate here is the negative catalyst mentioned above.</p>
<p>Catalysis is also necessary for the chemical reactions in animals and plants, such as the production of sweet potatoes, the production of sugar in sugar beets, the green color of vegetables, and the purple color of violets, all of which are due to enzymes acting as catalysts. Digestion in animal bodies, the function of human nerves and muscles, are all presided over by catalysts. Even the glow of fireflies is the catalytic effect of enzymes.</p>
<p>There are two very common catalysts in nature. The first is oxygen in the air, because there is air everywhere in the universe, so the catalytic effect of oxygen is often imperceptible. The effect proceeds naturally, seemingly unrelated to air. This relationship can only be discovered when the change proceeds in a vacuum or in another gas such as oxygen replacing air. Another very common catalyst is water. Some people knew early on that very dry carbon monoxide and oxygen cannot combine even under the influence of an electric spark, but if there is very little moisture, it immediately turns into carbon dioxide. Sodium and oxygen are the easiest to combine, but in a dry state, they can be heated to melting without changing. For example, dry ammonia and dry hydrogen chloride will not synthesize into ammonium chloride; it will occur immediately when there is moisture. However, in actual situations, it is not that no effect occurs at all without moisture. For example, when carbon monoxide and oxygen are dry, stronger electric sparks or increased air pressure are needed to take effect.</p>
<p>In addition, there is another peculiar thing, that is, in addition to adding one catalyst, adding another catalyst can make the change faster. For example, when potassium chlorate is heated and decomposed, adding manganese dioxide can already make the change faster, but if iron oxide is added, the rate of change is even faster. For example, when synthesizing ammonia, if aluminum oxide is used as a catalyst, adding potassium oxide can increase the catalytic effect of aluminum oxide. We call these iron oxide and potassium oxide promoters, meaning the catalysts of catalysts.</p>
<p>The purpose of using catalysis is to help carry out difficult chemical changes. However, how catalysts can increase or decrease the rate of change is still a mystery. Although precise research has been done, the actual situation is still mysterious and unclear. For example, when making oxygen with potassium chlorate, it is really impossible to say what effect this point of manganese dioxide has.</p>
<p>In short, catalysis is extremely important for both industry and science. If this catalysis had not been discovered, human enjoyment might not be what it is today. If one day the mysterious secrets of catalysis are uncovered, future applications will surely be more extensive. Let's see who uncovers this secret!</p>

<h3>Hypocrisy of the Wealthy</h3>
<p>— Jing Wen</p>
<p>Reports indicate that since Mayor Wu took the lead in demonstrating generosity by donating 500 million yuan for the special relief fund (this sum is said to have been obtained from the sale of paintings by the Mayor's wife at an exhibition in Manila), no one has followed suit with similar contributions. This has greatly worried several committee members, and some have even ridiculed the situation, saying that it proves there are no wealthy households in Shanghai and that talk of wealthy families and large amounts of capital is merely the fabrication of busybodies.</p>
<p>The question of whether there are rich people in China is open to debate and subject to different interpretations based on one's perspective. For example, those in the Legislative Yuan who oppose the imposition of property taxes simply believe that "China has no magnates, and it is unreasonable to deal a blow to those who dedicate themselves to serving the country" (referring to the property tax - the author). Others have even cited grand principles, stating that "the people have already earnestly fulfilled their various tax obligations to the country, and to impose additional taxes now is tantamount to confiscating property and destroying people's livelihoods."</p>
<p>One view is that China has no magnates, while another argues that even if there are magnates, they have already earnestly fulfilled their various tax obligations and should not be subjected to "additional levies" that "amount to confiscating property and destroying people's livelihoods."</p>
<p>It has long been stated in the Three Principles of the People that China has no magnates, only great poverty and small poverty. However, wealth and poverty are relative phenomena. Although China has not yet produced wealthy families as systematic and well-organized as the sixty families in America, the phenomenon of wealth concentrated in the hands of a few cannot be denied. The gap between the great poverty and small poverty that Dr. Sun Yat-sen spoke of has widened further after the two phases of "national crisis wealth" and "victory wealth." Compared to the United States, China is still characterized by great poverty and small poverty, but in terms of the internal phenomena of Chinese society, a clear contrast between great poverty and small poverty has already emerged.</p>
<p>China does have rich people. According to various unofficial estimates from relevant domestic and foreign sources, the private assets of a small number of "upper-class Chinese" in the United States amount to about 400 million US dollars, which is equivalent to the total amount of this American aid. Four hundred million US dollars may be a drop in the bucket in the United States, but if it were contributed to the country, it would certainly have a stabilizing effect on the social economy. Just think of the great effort we have made to have people fly back and forth to Washington, only to obtain this amount, and we still have to endure people's contemptuous looks!</p>
<p>Furthermore, there are countless large and small wealthy households in society. Although no one has responded to the current special relief donation, who were the people who spent thousands of gold pieces to win the "Miss Shanghai" competition in the past? Who are the people who are living lives of depravity and debauchery now? Didn't a certain lady recently want to spend money to build a temple to enshrine a pair of stone figures next to the racetrack? Why are they unwilling to take out some money to help the poor and assist the country?</p>
<p>The saying that the wealthy are unbenevolent is a long-established conclusion, and it applies equally in ancient and modern times, both at home and abroad! The Bible says that it is harder for a rich man to enter the kingdom of God than for a camel to pass through the eye of a needle, and characters like the Merchant of Venice in Shakespeare's plays are not merely satirical, but are based on real-life experiences. Recently, in Beijing, because no one donated to the special levy, Mayor He Siyuan lamented that asking the rich for money was like seeking skin from a tiger. Some passionate individuals in Beijing advocated organizing students to sing "You, you, you, you old miser!" in front of the homes of wealthy households. Some even suggested moving wounded soldiers and refugees into the homes of the wealthy. Although these actions are not advisable, they show how indignant people are. However, the rich are not entirely unwilling to spend money. If there were another "Miss Shanghai" competition or other activities to satisfy lustful desires, a group of filial sons and obedient grandsons would obediently come forward to contribute. Shanghai has plenty of "adopted fathers" and "dancing hall filial sons." Otherwise, one must rely on monks and nuns. Most of the rich are "pious men and women." Although they cannot be assigned to build bridges and repair roads, they will readily donate money to build temples and decorate Buddha statues. The money chests of the rich have only two keys: one for lust, and one for Buddha. Although our Buddha promotes the idea that lust is emptiness, the intertwining of desire and selfishness shapes the character of our rich.</p>
<p>However, we should not be pessimistic about this phenomenon, let alone discuss grand topics such as social morality and national decline. Every country has a small number of dregs, and every nation is bound to have a small number of scoundrels. Patriotism and national character cannot be found in these few dregs and scoundrels. Methods of moral and public opinion condemnation are unlikely to awaken the reason of these people. As the saying goes, "greed blinds the mind," which refers to this type of person. Since their minds are already blinded, what can we expect from them? To borrow a phrase from Ah Q: "Let them take their enormous wealth to their coffins!"</p>
<p>If the government truly has the courage to order the rich to contribute money, then it should simply implement property requisition, without using the name of special donations. The facts are already before our eyes: it is impossible to get wealthy people to donate voluntarily. If property requisition is implemented, it will certainly renew social ethics; political reform will inevitably follow.</p>
<h3>Amidst the Call for Frugality</h3>
<p>— Lian Sun</p>
<p>Recently, a twelve-year-old Dutch child sent the following short story to an American magazine and requested food as payment. People all over the world who have read this story have written letters praising it. I wonder what our Chinese readers will think after reading it?</p>
<p>A young man, seeing that life was becoming increasingly difficult, decided to save money by not taking the tram when he returned home from the office. He followed the tram all the way home and said to his wife, "Dear, I ran behind the tram and saved ten cents."</p>
<p>His wife exclaimed, "You're such a fool! If you had run behind the bus, you could have saved one dollar and twenty-five cents!"</p>
<h3>Original Manuscripts of Strange Tales from a Chinese Studio</h3>
<p>— Wei Ren</p>
<p>The original manuscripts of Strange Tales from a Chinese Studio were discovered in Northeast China during the Manchukuo period and were kept by Pu Wenshan, the author's tenth-generation descendant. Yuan Jinkai, a traitor, had selected and printed twenty-four tales, fifteen of which contained more errors and omissions than the published version, and nine of which were not found in the current version. Unfortunately, the copperplate printing made it difficult to reprint, even though the original manuscripts were preserved. Due to the frequent upheavals in Northeast China, it is difficult to trace the whereabouts of the Pu family. The Yuan-printed edition was not publicly distributed, and its circulation is thought to be extremely rare. Therefore, I am transcribing the tale "The Wu Artist" to share with the world.</p>
<p>"A certain Wu artist, whose name is forgotten, loved to paint Lu Dongbin. He always imagined and spiritually connected with him, hoping to meet him one day, and he constantly cherished this thought. One day, he encountered a group of beggars in the suburbs, one of whom, though wearing tattered clothes and exposing his elbows, had a remarkable air about him. The artist's heart stirred, suspecting that he was Lu Dongbin. Upon closer inspection, he became even more certain and grabbed the beggar's arm, saying, 'You are Lu Dongbin.' The beggar laughed loudly. The artist insisted that he was correct and prostrated himself, refusing to rise. The beggar said, 'If I am Lu Dongbin, what will you do?' The artist kowtowed, asking only for guidance. The beggar said, 'It is fortunate that you recognize me, but this is not the place to talk. We will meet again at night.' The artist tried to ask more questions, but the beggar had already vanished in an instant, leaving the artist astonished. That night, Lu Dongbin appeared in his dream, saying, 'I have come to see you because your thoughts are focused and concentrated, but your nature is greedy and stingy, and you cannot become an immortal. I will allow you to see someone.' He waved his hand in the air, and a beautiful woman descended from the sky, dressed like a noble consort, her radiance illuminating the room. Lu Dongbin said, 'This is Consort Dong. Examine her closely.' After a while, he asked again, 'Do you remember her?' The artist replied that he did. Lu Dongbin said again, 'Do not forget her!' Then the woman left, and Lu Dongbin also departed. The artist woke up feeling strange. He painted the woman he had seen in the dream, keeping it secret, and never understood the meaning. Years later, he happened to travel to the capital when Consort Dong died. The Emperor praised her virtue and ordered a portrait to be made, but the assembled artists, relying on oral descriptions and mental impressions, could not capture her likeness. Suddenly, the artist thought, 'Could the woman in my dream be her?' He presented his painting, which was circulated in the palace, and everyone said it was remarkably lifelike. As a result, he was offered the position of court secretary, which he declined, but was given ten thousand gold pieces, and his name became famous. Noble families competed to offer large sums of money, asking him to paint portraits of their ancestors, and all of them were remarkably accurate, even when he painted from memory. Within a month, he accumulated tens of thousands of taels of silver. Zhu Gongkui of Laiwu once saw him."</p>
<p>Other unpublished tales include "The Clam," "The Dragon Takes Water," "The Earth God's Wife," "The Dismissed Dragon," "Admonishing Ghosts," "The Fox of Ling County," "The White Lotus Sect," and "Bestiality," totaling ten tales including the aforementioned one.</p>
<p>The original text is much more concise than the published versions. For example, in the first sentence of "Continuing Yellow Millet Dream," "a licentiate from Fujian named Zeng Xiaolian Gao Jie Nan Gong," the four characters "before being allowed to return home" are crossed out. Above "Astrologer," the two characters "in white" are crossed out. Further down, after "greeted him and sat down, the astrologer," the original text reads: "looked at him and said: 'Sir, you have recently passed the imperial examination, and your spirits are quite high. Have you seen all the flowers of Chang'an?' Zeng shook his head and smiled. The astrologer asked about his birth date, and Zeng smiled and said, 'What official position will I ultimately attain?' As the astrologer pondered, Zeng smiled again and asked, 'Is there no chance of obtaining a python robe and jade belt?' The astrologer said, 'You can easily achieve that within ten years.' Zeng was overjoyed, expressing unexpected delight. The astrologer said seriously: 'Do not consider my words empty.'" The above eighty-six characters are shortened to "seeing his high spirits, he flattered him slightly. Zeng shook his head and smiled, then asked if there was a chance of obtaining a python robe and jade belt. The astrologer seriously promised," leaving only twenty-five characters. There are also omissions in the published versions. For example, in the "Green-Clad Woman" tale, after "diligently reading," the following twenty-two characters are omitted: "He thought, 'Where could I find a woman in the deep mountains?' As he pondered, the woman pushed open the door and entered, saying: 'Diligently reading!'"</p>
<p>In the "Lotus Leaf in the Cold Moon" tale, the original title has been changed to "Taoist Priest of Jinan," but some published versions have "Lotus Leaf in the Cold Moon" or "Lotus Hibiscus in the Cold Moon." The original title of "Tiger of Zhao City," "Tiger Cub," was crossed out and changed. In the "Poyang Lake" tale, the phrase "within which is a statue of the loyal minister Ding Pulang who died in battle" is often rendered as "statue of Taipulang" in popular versions. The original manuscript mistakenly wrote "Ding" as "Wood," and then changed it back to "Ding." The change is blurred, and at first glance it still looks like the character "Wood." Ding Pulang was a meritorious official of the early Ming dynasty, so "Taipulang" is incomprehensible.</p>
<h3>Stone Figures</h3>
<p>— Yi Yun</p>
<p>The stone figures in front of the racetrack are becoming increasingly bizarre. Someone has even petitioned the police station, requesting to build a temple at their own expense, move the stone figures for worship, and honor them as Buddhas (as seen in the ninth issue of this newspaper). How fortunate these stone figures are! They have ascended to the Western Paradise, becoming Buddhas and ancestors. This is truly the height of absurdity.</p>
<p>The origin of stone figures can be traced back to Ruan Wengzhong of the Qin dynasty, who was thirteen feet tall and extremely brave. During the reign of Emperor Qin Shi Huang, he stationed troops to defend Lintao, which greatly intimidated the Xiongnu. After his death, Emperor Qin Shi Huang cast a bronze statue of him and placed it outside the Xianyang Palace. Later, people regarded both bronze and stone statues as stone figures. Also, in the book "Primer of Juvenile Learning," there is a saying: "The stone figures in front of tombs were originally stone figures." Therefore, many people today regard stone figures as a specific term for stone figures in front of tombs. In fact, not all stone figures in front of tombs are stone figures. For example, the "Biography of Qiu Xinggong" in the "Book of Tang" states that Emperor Taizong of Tang carved statues of Qiu Xinggong and his horse in stone and placed them in front of the Zhaoling Mausoleum to commend his merit in protecting the Emperor. Therefore, the stone figure in front of the Zhaoling Mausoleum is Qiu Xinggong, not a stone figure. Furthermore, observing the mausoleums in various places, the shapes of the stone figures are different, some civil, some military, some old (with beards), and some young (without beards), so they cannot all be called stone figures.</p>
<p>Generally speaking, stone figures and stone horses, except for those specifically cast for meritorious officials by Emperor Qin Shi Huang and Emperor Taizong of Tang, are merely decorations in front of tombs, just like funerary figurines. One can freely create any kind of figures or animals, without necessarily adhering to the idea that a certain statue is a certain person or has a certain name. However, in the eyes of ignorant men and women, they do not know the origin of these stone figures, nor do they know who Ruan Wengzhong was. Seeing the solemn stone statues, they regard them as gods or Buddhas, kowtowing like pounding garlic and burning incense like bundles of firewood. This kind of incredibly foolish behavior is laughable. However, I dare not hastily conclude that those who petition to move and build a temple are purely driven by the aforementioned superstition. In a corner of Shanghai, there are many people who use deities to make money. Perhaps they see that the stone figures can be used to attract followers and want to take advantage of this opportunity to take ownership of the stone figures as a means of making money. If these "theological speculators" are granted their request, their mischief will be even worse than in front of the racetrack. In short, unless these stone figures are destroyed, their mischief will not stop. The fundamental solution is to smash them, so that future troubles will be eliminated. I wonder what the authorities think?</p>
<h3>Little Raindrops</h3>
<p>— Shi Jimi</p>
<p>Putting on sunglasses and thinking the sunny land is a cool land is so foolish for civilized people.</p>
<p>Some add robes to new clothes, while others prefer to add them after they become dirty.</p>
<p>Flowers have fragrance, the moon has light, mountains have color, water has sound, and people should have the flavor of people.</p>
<p>Fingernails painted with "Rouge Plant" are most suitable for hiding dirt.</p>
<p>"For a thousand years, the pipa speaks in a foreign tongue, clearly discussing grievances and hatred in the melody." - If there is no pipa, even the melancholy beyond the Great Wall cannot be known.</p>
<h3>Miscellaneous Poems of London</h3>
<p>— Zheng Xiaocang</p>
<p>The wind rises at dusk, waves crash on clothes, faintly visible by the Tower of London. I don't know how many wronged souls there are, but I see gulls flying over the water.</p>
<p>The library's collection is astonishingly vast, thousands of people silently working at their desks. Spending their lives studying is commonplace, they don't cherish their youthful beauty. (What I saw in the British Museum Library)</p>
<p>Heroism and tenderness are all before my eyes, good and evil are carved together, "Why bother to ask about lasting fame or infamy, there is always noise in the market." (Wax Museum)</p>
<p>The pivot of rise and fall, success and failure, lift up righteousness and make great contributions. Once public opinion turns, return to the smoky waves as a fishing old man. (Remembering Churchill at 10 Downing Street)</p>
<p>Lose rituals and seek it in the fields, this nation's younger generation excels at gathering local songs. Disturbing people eagerly say "thank you," common people know "thank you." (Whether buying tickets on the streetcar or trading in the market, both parties often thank each other, which is a commendable custom.)</p>
<p>Suddenly happy, suddenly sad, as if entering a dream, singing and dancing, wanting to forget the soul, Piccadilly is scattered, and the "Eaton" bell rings.</p>
<p>###</p>
<p>Tofu has always been regarded as a very ordinary food, so poor officials are called "tofu-eating officials." They only get some sacrificial meat during the Ding sacrifice, which is also called "alfalfa flavor" (not enough meat). Tofu and cabbage represent poverty and simplicity, and this has been the case for a long time. Today, in a changing economic society, the price of tofu and sesame oil is also astonishing. (In the occupied area of ​​the north, sesame oil was sometimes more expensive than pork oil, because the Japanese collected a lot of it to fill their military needs.) The saying that vegetarian food can solve livelihood is no longer applicable. As for whether tofu is completely plain and unremarkable, there is still much room for research. In the past, the four famous "Ju" restaurants in the old capital were all known for their delicious cuisine. They all had excellent dishes made with tofu, such as "chicken floss tofu," "pan-fried tofu," "casserole tofu," and "sauce tofu," which were all popular at banquets. In the market, there are also specialty shops for "stinky tofu," which uses tender tofu with spices, placed in a dark room for a certain period of time, and then taken out. Its color changes and the smell is offensive and unbearable. It is said that the taste is extremely delicious. (It makes me want to vomit, so I have never tried it, only heard people say so.) The oldest one is called Wang Zhili, followed by Wang Zhenghe and Wang Zhihe, all imitating the brand and echoing each other, each with more than two hundred years of history. Many people in the old capital are fond of it. As the saying goes, in the cities of the five capitals, there are people who chase after the foul smell. Is that what it means?</p>
<p>There is a kind of street food in Beijing called "douzhi" (the same as what the beggar Jin Song's family prepared in the play "Red Phoenix Happiness"), which is the soybean residue left over from the tofu workshop when it first makes tofu from soybeans. Some people buy it cheaply and cook it into a juice, which is valued by the bowl. It tastes sour and astringent, but it sells very well. At first, only poor people and coolies ate it, but then students and teachers did too. Whenever there were temple fairs and markets, people flocked to eat it, and the production became more and more refined. Some made a lot of profit and became famous for their production methods, even using "Douzhi Zhang" and "Douzhi Wang" to promote their unique skills. Utilizing waste is our Chinese people's specialty, cherishing materials and benefiting all beings is not to be underestimated.</p>
