<p>立院舉行秘密會議　聽取政府財經報告　王財長稱預算可望平衡</p>
<p>〔本報南京十日電〕立法院十日上午九時舉行秘密院會，聽取行政首長對財政經濟處分令實施情形之報吿，並加以檢討，以各委員要求發言者甚多，上下午兩度集會，尙未檢討完畢，定十三日繼續開會。十日開會時，出席委員達四百餘人，孫科主席，政院首長翁文灝，王雲五，王世杰，彭昭賢，陳啓天，左舜生，谷正綱，兪大維，關吉玉，李惟果，董顯光，徐柏園及央行總裁兪鴻鈞等均列席，由翁文灝，王雲五，兪鴻鈞分別報吿。翁文灝先就財政經濟緊急處分令之要旨及辦法作槪括敍述，並說明改革幣制之必要及改革後之效果。繼王雲五說明幣制改革對財政之影饗及下半年之收支情形。最後兪鴻鈞報吿收兌金銀外匯及發行鎳幣輔幣情形。王雲五在報吿中，除指出政府爲平衡收支，文武職公敎人員待遇暫時難予調整外，對鹽稅增收亦加以說明，王氏稱：鹽稅每祖自法幣四十五萬元改爲金圓八元，合每斤八分，戰前鹽價每斤九分，其中六分爲鹽稅，三分爲鹽値，依此比例，目前鹽稅每斤八分，鹽値四分，共一角二分，人人均可負担。至整個收支情形，因幣値穩定，稅收增加，預算可望接近平衡。兪鴻鈞之報吿中則詳列收兌金銀外匯數字，上海係截至九月六日止，其他各地截至九月三日止，收兌總値爲四千四百九十六萬九千美元，兪氏並說明改幣後政府外匯收支，已盈餘一千六百萬美元。關於蓉昆兩地　幣風潮眞相，兪氏謂正澈查中。報吿完畢後，各委員紛紛要求發言，總計上下午共達九十人，遂開始檢討，午前僅有三人發言，並宣讀二項書面意見。下午三時續會，孫院長因病未到，公推吳鐵城主席，繼續發言檢討者共十八人，大體對經濟改革方案表示擁護，主張應加强管制與澈底執行，並提供若干具體意見，對執行技術方面頗有補充，總計九日獲得發言者，計有黃元彬，羅衡，劉士篤，周伯敏，王世憲，皮以　，程天放，劉本琛，吳望伋，蕭覺天，周樹聲，李祖謙，高廷梓，王寒生，陸宗騏，鄭毓秀，李天民，唐國楨，劉明揚，尹述賢等，至下午六時張道藩提議未了質詢可改爲書面意見，交財政金融委會審査後，彙送政院答覆。鄭彥琛認爲不必經財金會審査，即逕送政院，此項修正意見，當經原提案人接受，但黃宇人等委員認爲仍應繼續口頭質詢，經付表決，張·鄭之動議被否決，主席乃宣布定十三日繼續口頭質詢。盧郁文等卅人復臨時動議，對總統咨文予以接受，以表示立院同人之態度，但一部份委員認爲總統係運用憲法臨時條款，僅對立院作一報吿，無所謂接受與否，此案以時間關係，未繼續討論，至六時一刻散會。</p>

<p>王逆三審皆判死刑，八日接到最高法院覆判核准書，九日典獄長往視，連呼「典獄長救救我，請代我找劉漢律師，我還要抗吿！」其精神如常，尙　最後擇老命，初未料及執行如此之快。執行令七日與覆判書同時到平，法院事先嚴守秘密，第一監獄今晨始奉命佈置本報記者到達，法警尙感驚奇。檢察官石屏離九時五十分簽提王逆，事前毫未料及，獄吏到時，王逆方喝完玉米粥一碗，與蛋糕兩塊。當吿以今日開庭，偵察你的病况，庭就在本監不必帶東西，王欣然上担架，由二獄吏抬出病監，上蓋灰格夾袍，紅格夾被，老奸面色紅潤，其著名之花白鬍子，亂如茅草，仰望天空，若有所思。法案般於一監後菜園刑塲，將王逆鋻置案前，檢察官即問：「你是王揖唐？」出人意外的，王逆開了口，答：「是。」問：「多大歲數？」答：「七十一歲。」問：「住那裏？」答：「沒有家。」檢察官當柔聲吿以奉命令。今天執行。你有遺囑嗎？答：「我要上訴！」此時，王逆神志已現緊張。檢察官吿以上訴不行了！你有什麽話說吧？王仍說出心裏不淸楚，說不上來了，我要上訴！再吿以上訴駁了，沒話說，就執行了！王含糊說出請大總統開恩：又問：你有財產需要處理嗎？答：我財產早都完了。此時上下嘴唇緊咬，再斷續說出「請大總統開恩。」書記官將原供詞念給王聽時，渠尙傾聽，再說「請大總統開恩」此時攝影畢，並按指印後，四人將王抬出離案前二十公尺，置於地上，執槍法警問其能坐起來嗎？渠竟應聲坐起，披上夾袍，臨死之痛快，出人意外，飲酒後，執行法警以一公尺之距離，描準發射先後四槍，彈皆未出瞠，換槍後，由地上檢起一彈扣入，第五彈始響，彈入正後腦，由右前方穿出，王逆身向左傾倒，呻吟抽氣，達三分鐘，氣不絕，檢査官乃命再發一槍，二次又有五彈未出瞠，第六彈方射出，老奸左腦炸一大洞，腦槳流出，如此仍抽動倒氣，達五分鐘，始仰首氣絕。半小時後，王逆堂姪王德鏞携鮮菓來探監，到後始知已執行，稍待，王逆之姪孫王衛宇至，收屍抬埋。王逆二女皆在滬，平方別無親人，棺木則早於僞官任內已購妥，將葬於西郊墓地。事後，記者巡視王逆所住之獨居病房，內置小鐵床，上敷白床單，靠牆東有餅干一盒，舊書「試選續集」等一堆。此外，有鹹蛋，蘋果，香蕉等。南牆釘有阿彌陀佛彩色像一張。老奸信佛，此當爲其朝夕乞命對象。</p>

<h3>行莊增資與儲蓄</h3>
<p>商業銀行調整資本辦法，於本月四日，經行政院臨時會議通過，此爲整理財政及加强管制經濟辦法第卅條的補充辦法。其中所定：（一）未達最低資本額者，應於二個月內增足；（二）分區訂定最低資本額：（三）資產增値之總數，不得超過其應增總額百分之五十，其餘應繳現金：及（四）期滿未能增資足額者，由部勒令停業各點，均與上項條文之原則完全相符·特於分區分類訂定資額之外，對於信托部或儲蓄部之附設，及不同市縣分支行之設立，另定資本之增加額，而原有資產之重估，又爲擬定若干標準與限制而已。</p>
<p>最重要之一點，自係第三條所定商業，實業，儲蓄銀行及信托公司之最低資本額，在滬津穗三市，股份有限公司及有限公司之組織，各定爲金圓五十萬圓，其他公司組織减半，錢莊又比照减半，這與當初擬議之百萬元標準，已一律减少一半，不能不說是顧卹商艱，從寬辦理，而且這是援照戰前銀行法規定辦理的，也不能說它無所依據。在業中人看來，戰前上海各行莊之資本總額共約四億元，衡以當時之存款總額四十億元，不過佔其十分之一，衡以當時之發行總額十四億元，也不過三分之一强。而現在上海最大之商業銀行，其存款不過七千餘億，折合金圓，僅二十三萬餘圓，是其最低資本額，最少已在存款額兩倍以上，其餘存額較低之大多數行莊，其倍數自更可觀。要知以幣値低落之結果，戰前第一流之銀行，其資本已收足五百萬，七百萬，一千萬元者，如果並未增資，現在折合金圓，均已不足五圓，自係不成局面。但五十萬圓之金圓，折合法幣，已達一萬五千億元，爲數究屬不少，依法雖許以不超過百分之五十的原有資產，重估作抵，但欲於兩個月的短期間內，一律完成增資，其所增的現金並須一律繳存中央銀行，在三個月內，非有正當用途經主管機關核准，不得動用。這在銀行本身，似乎不能不說是一種絕大的担負。</p>
<p>然而政府所以要强迫調整，提高其資本額，原係爲充實資力，鞏固信用起見。現在全國的行莊總數，在六千家以上，這個數目，究屬是否過剩，雖然見仁見智，言人人殊，但有一部份行莊，確屬資力薄弱，在某種特定地區，確屬單位過多，又以競爭太烈，開支太大，其正當業務，又不易展開，以致攔入物品購銷等業務，這却是不爭的事實。况潮流所趨，各國的銀行皆有化零爲整，逐漸合併的趨勢，調整辦法第九條，明許：「無力依法增資的銀行，將聯合數銀行，合併改組」，這也不失爲順應潮流的合宜措置，不單是爲這些力量較薄的銀行寬留一條生路而已。</p>
<p>大家知道，一切金融機構，俱是以授受信用爲業務的，故資力雄厚，某礎堅極，當然是發展業務的重要條件。但這也不過是發展業務的條件之一，任何行莊，要單靠它本身的資金來發揮運用。其力量也終覺有限。因爲資本等於基金，其運用全乃在存款，存款增加，纔是它力量的眞正充實。自通貨膨脹以來，人人輕幣重貨，不肯儲蓄，以至游資充斥，而存款却日見减少，因此，在行莊方面，根本已談不到發展。例如承受了一筆爲數較鉅的貸款，便不能不向國家銀行十重貼現或轉抵押，否則便無從調撥，至通常拆放，利息旣高，日期又極短，早已失去了扶助工商的意義。這並不是說，他們漠視職責，有意忽略了它固有的任務，也不一定由於資本短少，無法顧及其應有的往來，實是存款太少，周轉不易，尤其是定期存款，少到不及活存的十分之一，除了短期拆放，聊博微利以外，其於一般客戶的正當融通，確也有愛莫能助之憾。</p>
<p>所以銀行增資這一着，我們以爲應有幾種看法；第一，從疎導游資着想，當然是很對的。因爲單從上海一埠而論，商業行莊信托公司與錢莊，合計起來，約近兩百家，每家通扯增値到三十萬，便可以吸收資金到六千萬金圓，折合法幣可達一百八十萬億元，當發行總額三分之一弱。縱使其中之一半，可以原有的資產來抵充，其所吸收的游資，也是一個極大的數目了。第二　，從增强行莊的資力着想，那是對症發藥，更不必贅論.第三，從扶助工商業着想，這却還需要用種種方法獎勵儲蓄，把行莊的存款極力培養起來.據央行稽核處最近發表的七月份上海各行莊存款統計，其活存數目，雖比六月份增加百分之g　百十强，但定存祗增百分之二强，又定存總數仍不過活存的十分之一，可知這許多資金，大部份還是暫時寄庫的性質，各行莊依然無法大量運用，換言之，工商業還是沾不到充分地融通的效益。因此之故，除了增加行莊的資本以外，我們仍希望政府和社會各方面，迅速從提倡儲蓄入手，以健全國民經濟的基礎。至於如何鼓起一般人儲蓄的興趣，那又與物價的穩定有關，故政府用其全力以促使一般物價的穩定，確是當前最重要的任務了。</p>

<h3>暹民主黨草擬新計劃　限制我僑胞發展　規定華僑商店聘暹人作副經理</h3>
<p>〔中央社曼谷十日電〕遷羅民主黨昨草成一限制此間華僑自由發展之計劃，其形式與菲律賓前此所訂者極爲近似。根據此新計劃，所有華僑商店及貨棧均須延請暹人作副經理，其雇用人負暹人所佔比例亦不得少於百分之五十。依此則販賣零碎物品之小店，至少亦須每店用一暹人爲副經理矣。惟僉信縱遷議會通過此一議案，其實行亦將難如預期之滿意。理由爲多數在遷華僑皆已具有雙重國籍，而暹政府如果決定强制彼等開革原用人員一半，而另雇一批完全外行之暹人代之，亦勢必引起市場之極大騷動。</p>

<h3>卅萬柏林市民反共示威　蘇軍開鎗釀成流血　為急取自由死傷二三十人</h3>
<p>〔合衆社柏林九日電〕蘇軍十人九日下午在柏林英佔區內向卅萬名非共黨示不威者發射手提機關槍，據目擊此事之本社記者艾姆斯稱，渠會見一人跌倒。據其估計，蘇軍約開槍六十嚮。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社柏林九日電〕柏林居民因反抗共黨破壞柏林之自由，集英佔區舉行大規模示威，在示威近結束時，英蘇佔區邊界之「勝利門」一帶形勢突趨緊張，示威羣衆以石子擲擊蘇警吉普，又有若干羣衆爬上「勝利門」撕下群聯國旗，蘇警察朝天開槍成嚇，而蘇方管制下之德警槍傷示威者二三十人。在示威開始時，羣衆列隊前進，秩序井然，各執標語旗幟如「無自由卽不能有社會主義」，「爭取柏林蘇佔區之自由」等等。示威原由組織者在美區無綫電台用四種言語廣播號召，英藥法三佔區各店舖工廠在中午時均停市響應，示威大隊由紅黑與金黃色之威瑪共和國旗作前導，社會民主黨各領袖曾向示戴者發表演講，指斥目前之局勢，與納粹統治時代無異。柏林市長極力抨擊暴徒攻擊市政廳事件，渠稱：「此為破壞自由之開始，我人欲爭取公民所應事受之自由，決不承認暴徒之把持市議會，我人之任務為保衛柏林，我人必至死為爭取自由而奮鬥」。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社柏林九日電〕據當局報告，在今日反示威運動中，除蘇區德警兩名被羣衆用石塊擊死外，示威者被槍傷約二三十人。德警開槍之起因，由於示威者爬上「勝利門」，撕下蘇聯國旗。當時德警開槍卽傷撕旗者六七人，其中兩人重傷，此時有蘇區警察之吉普車開到，羣衆紛紛以石塊攻擊吉警車，警察乃又開槍擊傷若干人。警察開槍後，蘇軍代表卽至英區邊界與英軍警代表商議，旋示威者由英軍警驅回，事態得未繼續擴大。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社柏林九日電〕在蘇區登記之ADN德國通訊社稱稱：今日之示威乃由社民黨屬下之法西斯靑年所策動，彼等衝入蘇佔區，爬上勝利門，用石塊擲擊行人，蘇區警察乃被迫開槍示威。法西斯靑年顯然不惜任何代價，企圖桃起流血事件。又據該通訊社估計，示威羣衆約計卅萬人。</p>

<p>房捐地價稅　不得不調整</p>
<p>參議員對各局之質詢如下：財政部份；提質詢者僅姜豪一人，田局長答覆稱：串通商號遲繳營業稅，從中漁利事，本局業加澈査，類似者尙無査獲，惟意圖敲詐者已査有數起，業送法院査辦。至營業稅乃市府命脈，決設法如期收納，過去財政局是今年收去年稅，現已做到本季收本季稅財政局始終顧到人民負担，徵稅不願巧立名目，惟事到如今，已無法維特，不得不酌量調整房捐及地價稅以資彌補。</p>
<p>閘北區中校舍　被佔無法應付</p>
<p>敎育部份：提質詢者有張志韓，江浩然，冀夏，張驥等，李局長綜合答覆如下：（一）上次參議會曾決議增加班次二百班，所以迄未增添者，實由於市府經濟支絀，無法進行。現經市長批准暫添五十三班，今後當陸續求其增加。（二）獻校事未進行，乃由於曾有不肖份子投機取巧，致引起糾紛，今後凡有確切地址，產權，及房契者，敎育局當准其設立，至上期獻校經費業已照發。（三）閘北區學校，有於敵僞時期被佔，勝利後又爲軍人强佔迄未遷出，敎育局處境實甚困難，蓋軍事機關不但爲敎育機關所無法應付，即或政府機關亦東手無策，現擬轉請警備司令部協助辦理。（四）閘北等區學校所遭戰事損失之貼補費。敎育局曾一再呈文中央請撥，惟均石沉大海，權不在我，唯嘆心有餘而力不足耳。（五）爲普及敎育須多設市校一點，敎育局必將盡全力以赴。至於增加敎育經費一點，亦將力爭，査本年度本市之敎育經費百分數爲二二·五，而按中央行憲後規定，直轄市之經費應爲百分之三十五以上。（六）博愛小學校長及教員，因配給發生衝突事，現已解決，敎育局將再査眞相，如情形嚴重，當予撤職處分。（七）龍華區八保附近三四里無一學校，致求學困難問題，希地方當局能計劃添設，敎育局當予協助。</p>
<p>民地迄未發還　由於軍事爲重</p>
<p>地政部份：提質詢者計曹俊，兪傳鼎，瞿鋮等，祝局長答道如下：（一）敵偽時期，江灣區有民地三四萬畝被圈佔，農林部眞如電台，龍華機場等所佔民地頗大，所以迄未發還者，乃因佔居者大多屬軍事機關，數度接洽，均無結果。戡亂期間，中央明令以軍事爲重，故除一部份發還外，餘均由各機關出價征收。又前經參議員晋京請願後，核准成立審議會，國防部，交通部等均派代表參加，決議於三個月內淸理完畢，現已解決者計七件，餘決從速審議，再將決議案送覆各業主。（二）地政局辦事太慢，手續麻煩一點，今後當不斷改進。（三）估價工作不能盡如理想係受物價彼動影響，今後當可改進。</p>

<h3>修理虹僑路　與豪富無關</h3>
<p>工務部份：提質詢者計張中原·嚴諤聲·襲夏等三人，由趙局長祖康答覆如下：（一）馬路積水現象，確已較戰前改進，江蘇路，白利南路一帶已無積水現象，前法租界各處亦已好轉，工務局天天閙窮，各項工作進行實受阻碍。（二）修理郊區工作已經展開，修理虹橋路，並非因該區乃豪富顯貴所經之路，其他主要馬路，均將動工興修。（三）取締連章建築，乃工務局職責所在，望市民加以檢舉，工務局當澈底執行。（四）楊樹浦一帶沿路堆積雜物，阻碍交通，當予設法搬遷。</p>
<h3>警員態度欠佳　當予嚴密注意</h3>
<p>警政部份：提質詢者計施宗德。陳培德·王國賢·潘介眉等，由俞局長叔平答覆如下：（一）改編後之新門牌迄未發下事，乃因尙未整理完竣、日內卽可統發。（二）人力車漲價原因，據車夫稱係罰款激增一點，按車輛違章罰款，在改革幣制後改爲一角六分，後經國府公佈恢復戰前定章，乃改收一元以上，六十元以下。（三）警員在警亭中服務精神不佳，時有興市民任意取笑，並遇意外時，常推諉責任一點，當予嚴密注意，如經査獲，卽加處罰。</p>
<p>自衛團未實現　乃由經費無着</p>
<p>民政部份：提質詢者僅李華一人，詢民衆自衛團爲何迄未實現？張局長曉崧答：其預算有計劃，均經繼製就緒，未實現之故，乃因無經費，待經費一有着落，卽可籌組。</p>
<p>西藥未聞抬價　出售病豬不確</p>
<p>衛生部份：提質詢者計張志韓。范守澗。陳培德等，張局長維答覆：（一）　價絕對遵守限價，超過八一九舊價說，絕對不確，惟如裝運時船夫擅自抬價，則自非衛生局所能控制。（二）西藥有超過限價事，迄無所聞。如有黑市價格發現，希加檢舉。（三）市上平價肉傳有病豬出售一點，絕非確實，因衛生局檢騐向甚嚴格。（四）籌設中醫院事，正與衛生部洽商中。</p>
<h3>貨物補不進　絕對非事實</h3>
<p>社會部份：提質詢者有張中原。嚴諤聲。柴子開。范錫品等。吳局長開先答覆：（一）物價嚴格限制後，商號貨物有補不進之恐慌說，絕對非事實，純係商人之病態心理，如確魏有困難，可向社會局吿發，俾對批發商加以制裁。（二）香　雖非日用必需品，但如大量購存意圖囤積，亦係遠反法令，當予取締。（三）利用美援作爲本市農村復興委員會經費事，因上海市民已享受美援中之配米部份，餘款將充作其他各地復興晨村之用。</p>

<h3>彈指十年　造幣廠「復活」　奉令積極整理　下月十一開鑄</h3>
<p>〔本報特寫〕幣制改革令公佈以來，誰都知道最忙的是經濟督導員辦公室，中央銀行，經濟警察和戡建大隊等機構，却很少有人曉得中央造幣廠工作的緊張，正不在一上列各機關之下。他們準備使這殭斃了十年，全國首屈一指的造幣廠，在二個月內復活。這幾乎是不可能的奇蹟，因爲這個廠在戰時損失太大了，機器廠房，或被拆，或被燬，所有設備差不多損失殆盡。然而全廠員工深知時代所賦予使命的重要，在廠長韋憲章率領下，日夜趕工修理，決意完成這復工的偉大任務。</p>
<p>八月十日財政部王部長電召韋廠長晋京，沒有說明原因，沒頭沒臘地限韋廠長把造幣廠在半個月內復工，韋廠長受命之下，幾乎懷疑部長發了瘋，那麼短的時間可能嗎？但是下屬不便反抗上司，默默地領受了下來，他十一日返滬後，卽召集舊部，十五日開始着手整理，十九日改革幣制令發表了，全職員工，方才恍然大悟，「七氣」也因此大振，整理工作進展快速。韋廠長昨天很有把握的對記者說：十月「日試軍，十月十一日可以正式復工。最先鑄造的是半圓銀質輔幣與一分銅幣，一萬盎斯白銀，日內卽將由央行運來，現在各銀行收兌的銀圓，他日都是這裏的原料。日本歸還的各種銅鎳輔幣，亦將全部送到廠裏來整理熔鑄。半圓銀幣的模印還在雕刻中，正面是總統像，反面中央是「半圓」二字，底下雙嘉禾，頂上有「中華民國三十七年」字樣（見圖）。銀幣每枚重五公分，合純銀八成，電銅二成，大小如圖，一分銅幣圖案與民國二十五年發行的半分完全一樣。開工後，毎天銅幣可出卅萬枚，銀幣一百萬枚。俟銀幣與銅幣有相當出品後，鎳幣亦急需鑄造。全國所使用的輔幣，都將在這裏艇生，廠務的發展，正方興未艾，殭斃了十年的造幣廠，因幣制的改革而得到了更生。</p>

<p>被驅逐　回貴陽</p>
<p>果然，抗戰勝利了！按理說，他應當有個較好的日子過，無奈好事多磨，舞廳褒裏一個客人的大衣遺失了，淸査的時候，家家都說是他幹的，經警察局判定把他驅逐出境，從此他又走上　　的路，不能繼續呆在上海，這時他唯一的希望是如何逃難回家鄕，依舊去過他的佃農生涯。</p>
<p>從上海，他混雜在輪船上到了漢口，憑他一身氣力，在碼頭上作了一陣子脚伕，因而得與一些走川江上游的船家接觸，還順便學到了一手搖船的本領，於是帮同一家姓魯的船主搖船，他就如此流浪轉徙的到了重慶，這時候，他多少積蓄了一點錢，自八月月五日起，他就從重慶出發，徒步來到貴陽，沿途還爲人祖當力伕。</p>
<p>公園裏　夫妻會</p>
<p>筑回到自己的家鄉後，心情上當然愉快得多，但是生活高昂，積蓄花光，夢寐已久的家鄉也無他的立足之地，前些日子病魔又繼繞在他的身上，平價醫藥都無法可想。他對人說：這時他實在不想再活下去了，死在自己的家鄉地方，就算還了心願。好像是誰的意旨，生別了十載有餘的他的妻子張競芳，昨天下午爲主人送信到河濱公園管理處去，他們竟本期然地「久別重逢」了，前半段的歡快當然可想而知。</p>
<p>抱頭哭　相憐勉</p>
<p>據張競芳向他的流浪丈夫和圍觀者談：自從丈夫離開之後，就未得着一點消息，「許多人都說你已經死了，勸我再嫁，我總不相信，今天，你終於回來了！」她高興到幾乎發了狂，忘記了應該在圍觀「我不能留在黔西家鄕裏聽人家的笑駡，卅四年就來貴陽帮人了，現在在太慈橋李公館裏作帮工，日子還可勉强活下去。</p>
<p>他倆又重逢在這難困的人生旅途上，喜不自禁，抱頭大哭一陣來，互相憐勉，哭總不是法子，於是緩步在河濱公園的柳提上，計劃他們未來的生活。張競芳是一個有工可做的，得到丈夫比得到任何寳貝還高興，可是她的丈夫「一切都沒有」，遠不似乍逢重聚時候的神情了，當記者詢問他兩今後怎樣辦時，李安國反而問我：「先生，約請帮工嗎？」這眞窘住了我，只好回答他一個苦笑。</p>

<h3>行莊外匯移存完畢　集中整理後即呈財部審核　工廠公司之外匯資產另案辦理　大致將限於本月十八日前移存</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕本市行莊保險信托業之外匯移存申報登記，已於昨日芷午大體順利完成。中報之單位超過三百五十個，全部資料於午後由業務局吳副局長斌集中整理，預定由林局長樂塘於昨夜全部帶京，以供部方審核。但如整理費時，則林氏可能延至今晨搭平車晋京。據負責人士透露；商業銀行中擁有外匯最多者，當推上海銀行，浙江實業，金城，聯合等四家；浙江興業則已賣出頗多。錢莊之中，則以福源居首席。保險公司所有之外匯數字，並不甚高。統計行莊之外匯資產時，可發現其過去所買入之外匯，有已因股東職員之分紅而成爲私人所有，法人所有者不如意料之多；此種情形，在小規模之行莊中，尤屬屢見不鮮。至於移存之外匯數字，則因資產之種類繁多，包括各種外幣及外股，折　困難，此時尙難估計。同時在南京未來之審核工作中，將詳加硏究，以斷定行莊具報之數字，是否翔實可靠，然後再予以正式公佈。至於工廠及公司外匯資產之移存，將另案辦理，大致將限令於本月十八日以前，移存中中交農四行。將來此筆外匯頭寸如何動用，亦由財部規定具體辦法，與商業銀行錢莊信託保險業無殊。其登記移存之詳細辦法，亦正由中央銀行與　家委托銀行洽商中。</p>
<h3>去路呆滯交易清稀　食米市氣萎靡　粉糧油餅喊價一致下挫</h3>
<p>米市疲軟乏神，北市雖勉强站住上日原價，南市塲續見修削，良以去路頗呆，米店少有添補，市氣萎靡，交易清稀。薄稻降二角，白粳低一角，秈米則因新秈上市日多，故降二三角，獨白元始終站住原價，原因爲貨少之故。北市塲交易亦少，市勢甚疲，價維原盤。昨日到貨南市二千六百八十五石，北市一千七百五十五石。</p>
<p>麵粉</p>
<p>虛軟，實銷呆滯，交易淸淡，廠方雖無供應，市上存貨因銷路少而尙感充足，是以供應不乏。初開價格尙能站住原盤，收市終見稍挫。老軍粉七元五角一分，計削二分，兵船低三分，雜牌粉少上落，大致仍站原盤。麩皮五元三角，略疲一分，小麥廠盤仍爲十元零三角。</p>
<p>雜糧</p>
<p>平疲，因銷路呆木，已成供過於求之勢，黃豆客銷停頓，油價降而廠胃呆，市呈疲象。蠶豆按限開出，紅糧新貨到多，銷化甚少，價削二角。菉豆鮮有交易，徐州新菉豆十七元一角，苞米交易活潑，烟台客帮拾取，價格亦定。芝蔴開出百餘包，生仁去化呆木，市仍疲軟。</p>

<h3>洋莊茶穩秀</h3>

<h3>市塲平靜如故　銀根依舊鬆弛</h3>
<p>昨日物資市塲平靜如故，交易數額亦顯見减退。據悉部份熱門貨塲外對做仍不時傳聞，銀根泛濫情形未見圓緊，暗息在一角二分至一角五分間，大宗頭寸頗不易拆出，往往需前一天預約留額，始有去路，工商業因客帮裝運不便，實銷呆滯，投機風氣消弭。「踢皮球」「搶帽子」等拉抬交易，一掃而光。市民觀感，亦以物價平穩。一反以前搶購狀態。是故各業交易平淡，商界中常有倒帳發生。擁單者對拆放頭寸不得不索取抵押品，以爲保證。昨日各市塲均無波動。</p>

<h3>輸管會發表　出口貨國外市况</h3>
<p>據輸管會息，上週（八月三十日至九月四日）出口貨品市况上落互見，惟一般走勢尙穩。該會第二次公布出口限價貨品，包括桐油·猪鬃·皮毛·羽毛·草帽·茶葉·將油·羊毛·腸衣等項。以桐油而論，限價辦法公布實施後，上週國外行市卽已好轉。至主要貨品國外行市及輸出概况，各別情形，有如下述：</p>
<p>桐油</p>
<p>國外價格本週續見好轉，紐約現貨每磅美金自一角九分又四分之三升至二角。倫敦行市亦秀，週內每噸自一四五鎊漲至一五五鎊。國內市况淸淡，惟九底後，即入吒銷季節，出口甚有希望。</p>
<p>猪鬃</p>
<p>國內外市况均穩，紐約現貨每鎊美金計重慶二七號二元八角，上海一七號二元六角，至上F.O.B價格，天津短五五號六·三五元，二六號四·八五元，本週猪鬃市况活躍，惟來貨稀少，供不應求。</p>
<p>茶葉</p>
<p>近以法屬北非對綠茶頻來沽購，英國亦有意紅茶，近且取銷其對純凈華茶與台灣茶之限價，外銷樂觀。本週倫敦茶市，上等祁門紅茶，每磅美金四角五分，上等屯溪綠茶三角三分，平水珠茶三角，上海F.O.B價格中等祁紅每磅美金二角五分</p>
<p>生絲</p>
<p>國內已受限價，其出口限價則尙未實施。新幣制實行後，照目前匯率，已可出口。國外市况本週仍平靜，紐約現貨每磅美金計A級三`四五元，B級三·三〇元，C級三·一五元，D級三·〇〇元，E級二·五五元。</p>
<p>紗布</p>
<p>國外行市無變化，上等疋頭每疋F.O.B價格仍爲美金一〇·五元。</p>
<p>其他貨品，上海F.O.B美金價格爲：本色鴨毛每磅三角三分，白鵝毛每磅四角八分，上等生牛皮每磅三角，次等土牛皮每磅二角，細腸衣每付一角八分，以上外銷均可獲利。上等五棓子每磅一角三分，樟腦粉每磅四先令等，則出口稍有損失。</p>
<h3>各方納胃減少　紗價疲檔徘徊　棉布去化狹隘交易清閑</h3>
<p>昨日紗市，在供源充沛下，更以布價下游，各方納胃已漸减少，同業感走銷呆滯，籌墊資金，不勝負担，蓋紡建公司及申新·永安等廠領導開紗後，同業間如放棄承配，則從此取銷承配權，但獲得配紗後，則須籌墊資金，市上銷路滯鈍，頗難脫手，因此塲內所做交易，大都係配得之紗，急於吐售，人心亦覺疲軟，開價有不少在限度內貼本拋售。</p>
<p>又訊：紡建公司三日配售十支紗價四百八十元，十六支五百八十元，二十支七百零七元，卅二支七百八十七元，昨因改組關係，紗未開售。</p>
<p>又訊：申新紗廠又委託棉紗商業公會，按抽籤法於下午在會爲第三次開紗，共計各種粗細紗三百七十九件，各紗號抽得配紗後，今（今十一日）上午十一點止，即須繳款。</p>
<p>昨棉布市情，因禁止出口，海關暫停結關，客帮運貨艱難，本街去化狹隘，更以紗市供多價疲，民營紗廠亦有棉布開售，各方進意懈怠，業中相繼拋售，染廠照限已有供售，塲內僅有門莊布號零星添補，市面甚覺淸閑。</p>
<p>十二磅龍頭細布，結果仍站廿八元原盤，至熱銷細布，喊做不寂，五福·五福B·喇叭童又B字`陽鶴B·龍頭B等均有成交，行情各挫二三角至六七角不一，惟色布元布士林布及漂布標準布等，一致平穩，全日成交二千零四十疋。</p>
<h3>國內匯率逐步减低　最高不逾千分廿五</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕自財經緊急處分令發表後，央行已將全國各地之內匯匯率逐步减低，目前各地匯率，最高以不超過千分之廿五爲限。此後將斟酌情形，再予减低，以千分之二十爲最高收費額。其他行局庫及商業行莊向央行調撥其本身或其代理處之頭寸，可儘量予以便利，惟其原定匯水，亦應同樣减低，卽凡有央行分處各地，其匯率最高不得高過央行所定匯率之百分之二十。如各地行莊有不遵照此規定承匯者，央行可取銷其請調頭寸之資格，不予代調。</p>

<h3>全世界對籃球賽　在瘋狂狀態中　美世運籃球領隊　談倫敦大會觀感</h3>
<p>〔合衆社紐約九日電」據自英凱旋旋返美之美國世運籃球隊領隊稱：「全世界對籃球賽，正在瘋狂之狀態中。」奧林匹克籃球委員會主席威爾基稱：「國際籃球比賽成熟期，已在不遠。籃球在歐洲正盛極一時，南美洲亦如火如荼。彼等已超過我人之理想，表演百分之一百佳美籃球技術。」威爾基及美世運籃球隊敎練白朗寗，俱對自一九三六年以來，各國籃球之進步表示驚異，但並不感覺美國在下屆世運或再下屆世運，有失去冠軍之危機。威爾基稱：「我人在倫敦幾乎遭遇歷史上第一次之失敗，我人力戰，才以五十九比五十七擊敗阿根廷。」白朗寗評論稱：「我人如果用較舊之方法，卽可不致如此。阿根廷隊進攻猛烈，但防守則漏洞百出。彼等甚至仍亦採用區域防守方法，甚或較此更陳舊者。」一部份觀衆中，雖有對美國隊員之高度，尤其是七呎長之中鋒克倫特，表示不服者，大部份對美國隊，皆表示歡迎。國際籃球協會曾討論關於下屆世運會限制籃球員高度間題，投票結果，十七對二十七票，否決對長人加以限制。因考慮後，覺得克倫特實爲一良好籃球員，亦爲性情溫善之長人。克倫特稱：「我人大可利用長人，佔得便宜，但決定不如此做。根據一九三六年規則，余可站在對方之籃下，當一名籃圈保護人，將來球自籃內擊出。但我人從未有一次如此。」南美及法國對籃球競賽，尤當興趣，在每次比賽前，大唱國歌，鼓勵士氣。彼等動作快，射籃準，在罰球區域內，尤爲可怕。惜彼等之方法，較爲落伍，美國在過去十年中之進步，使彼等望塵莫及。依目下盛况，籃球賽不但將水遠列入世運會節目中，且將與田徑游泳，同樣成爲重要項目。</p>

<h3>總賑</h3>
<p>— 白水</p>
<p>直到最近我近有機會讀到美國多羅色·巴克爾夫人Dorotlry那樣的妙詩，還是從朱自淸先生所引的譯文中當鼎一幾（見「論雅俗共賞」頁五七），朱氏稱之爲「常識的詩」，這是英國老小說家兼戯劇家毛姆W.Somersetugham日在導言裏給他的稱呼。詩本來有兩種，一種是上天下地的亂想，愛怎麽說怎麽說，想怎麽說怎麽說，李白的類型是也，這也就是一種「眞」，不過是感情的；一種是專說老實話，說透了別人不願說甚至是一刀子戳個窟窿釣老實話，罵大街也可以，別人想不透的你想透了更是出色的聰明，陶淵明是此型，杜甫也是此型，但是作格言詩和座右銘的先生們可不能算，那股子道學的酸氣乃是偽君子的裝腔，不能稱爲詩的眞。巴克爾夫人有一首「總賬」，我覺着就挺不錯：</p>
<p>剃刀敎你傷臉</p>
<p>河水沾衣濡足</p>
<p>酸類給你們留搬</p>
<p>藥物抽筋張脈</p>
<p>槍彈不懂規矩</p>
<p>圈套在開着等人</p>
<p>煤氣刺鼻欲吐</p>
<p>你們還照樣生存</p>
<p>這可不是老實話嗎？我們中國詩人雖亦多悲人生的艱辛，猶之乎「譬如朝露，去日苦多」等句，好是够好，可是比起來我覺得不够勁兒！換言之，不具體，沒有意象，那就不容易爲大家，大多數所欣賞。由這裏看起來，詩裏所謂常識，與普通的大有不同。老師敎給我們，或是書籍吿訴我們絕不能說因爲剃刀傷臉而不刮鬍子，更不能因爲藥物抽筋張脈而停止吃藥。普通常識管這個呌「不可因　廢食」，話說得也不差，不吃可不就餓死了嗎！然而社會上也竟有把不可因噎廢食擴大而成爲人類的汚點的，卽如戰爭，本來也是不可因噎廢食理論之放大也。我曾寫一小文日政治道德，謂征伐之事，是以力量强迫別人承認他是合理，殺人者死，是噎了，殺人而利天下就是不廢食，可是你說到底利了天下沒有？這還得考究。按照詩人的天眞想法，頂好是大家都放下刀子，握握手。臉上的髯子也是生命，剃不剃有什麼關係，何必讓皮肉戰戰兢兢呢！藝術家留長髮，有道理呀！可是天下事不能儘往天眞裏頭想，因爲你天眞別人不天眞。朱自淸先生在「論老實話」一文中說，不說老實話的原因是彼此防備，唯恐吃了對方的虧；不錯，入是最不成玩意兒的，嘴裏說好話，脚底下使絆兒，任何動物也沒有這麼不要臉的，然而這就是人之所以爲人。孟子說的人之所以異於禽獸者幾希，庶民去之，君子存之，我早就說這是胡說，唯其君子存之，所以君子才最不是東西。人類以禽獸爲罵人的話，如果我是禽獸，一定以「人」爲罵禽獸的話。譬如狗，就可以罵同類的狗爲「你這個不忠不義的人！」職蜂可以屬雄蜂「你這個游手好閒的人！」蟻和蚜虫更可以罵；「你這個不知相親相愛互助互諒的人！」人憑什麽罵禽獸呢，饒是欺騙了他們，吃他們的肉，賣他們的皮，還要罵他，好沒有良心！大率人類的特點就是會自已製造圈套，而又自己鑽了進去，死來死去，還是人死得最多最慘，也算是報應循環吧！這可是詩人的常識，詩人算的總賬，若是給棉紗大王股票金剛什麼的聽了去，一定說你在發神經，沒常識。怪！天下頂沒常識的人就是頂有常識的，而且他們會是優秀分子，天下豈得不大亂乎？</p>
<p>這本總賬眞難算！</p>
<h3>高貴的賊</h3>
<p>— 孫容</p>
<p>全世界第一流的大旅館中都常常發現「順手牽羊」的貴客，他們把鍍銀的刀叉和毛巾帶走，據說是留作紀念的。英國豪華輪伊利沙白島后號上甚至每開駛一次餐具便要損失幾千件之多。</p>
<p>但是，那些「順手牽羊」的人們這是對美國的總統府白宮最感興趣，刀叉上都刻着「白宮」字樣，豈非最理想的紀念物？於是，總統每請客一次，便一定有許多刀叉不翼而飛。宴會的規模愈大，損失的刀叉也愈多。</p>
<p>據說，羅斯福太太曾特向美國的「一角商店」之類的店家買進大批刀叉，專供客人們偸去作爲紀念物之用。</p>
<h3>遐庵近作</h3>
<p>— 葉恭綽</p>
<p>梁君永槐司廣九路工程今四十年往續丕著詩以表之</p>
<p>何妨開路作先鋒，四十年間衆景從。齒冷高材爭得鹿，神全老子本　龍。扶輪妙得先民意，合轍能追哲匠蹤。差喜頌聲今載道，成蹊桃李綠陰濃。</p>
<p>又擬宮怨二首</p>
<p>奉帶昭陽四十秋，新妝顧影本無籌；含情待說開天事，攬鏡誰知漸白頭！</p>
<p>連年貯苦與停辛，舊夢渾憐碧王身；莫訝當筵頻顧誤，曲中多少過來人。</p>
<h3>脚痛</h3>
<p>— 林琳</p>
<p>據一部份歷史家的看法：三十年前有一個人脚痛，結果竟使人類遭到了第二次世界大戰的浩刧。</p>
<p>這個脚痛的人就是當時的美國大總統成爾遜。威爾遜總統的脾氣極壞，常常無端大發雷霆，弄得四週的人個個痛心切齒，多數國會議員都曾莫名其妙的受過他的侮辱，因此大家想報復，等威爾遜在戰後提出國際聯盟法案時，國會一看正是大好機會，就毫不客氣的來了一個否決，美國因而就沒有參加國聯。如果美國能够參加國聯，而且在國聯中發生一種領導的作用，那麽國聯的地位就可以增不强少，第二次大戰未始不能避免。</p>
<p>但是，威爾遜的脾氣爲甚麼這樣躁急呢？——却爲了他的一雙脚。他一生有是疾，痛的時候簡直像刀割一樣。威爾遜是一個極考究儀表的人，平常本來有三分傲氣，所以儘管脚痛難熬，却從來不肯對別人訴一句苦，祇是咬緊了牙關忍受。正好碰着政務繁忙，自然容易動怒了。</p>
<p>美國歷史上還有大位大總統也常有脚痛之疾。林肯說：「我在脚痛的時候，想做隨便什麼事都沒有心緒，我甚至不能靜心思索。</p>
<p>據美國「全國足科醫師公曾」估計，美國全國人口中有百分之七十都是有脚痛病的，總數達一億人。脚痛的種類從「鷄眼」起到可怕的癌症爲止，大小共五十三種。最普通的是老繭，濕氣，趾甲嵌入皮肉，脚趾畸形生長等幾種。</p>
<p>美國敎育部曾在各學校施行學生脚部檢査，結果發現絕大多數的學生穿的鞋子都嫌太小，影響了脚的健康。</p>
<p>除此以外，醫生們說，太太小姐們在交際塲中偶然穿穿高跟皮鞋，倒還無損於脚的健康；但是，如果穿了高跟鞋辦公，做家裏的雜務，或者上街買東西——那麼一到晚上，一定就疲倦不堪，脾氣極壞，爲了一點點小事情就會吵嘴。</p>
<p>以下是醫生們給大家的勸吿，如能忠實履行，脚痛必可减少</p>
<p>（一）試穿新鞋後，必須立起來走兩步，然後再買，切勿坐着一試便買。</p>
<p>（二）我們的左右脚大小，常有差別，買鞋時應當照較大的一只脚的尺寸。</p>
<p>（三）不要赤脚穿鞋，應當穿襪。襪的高度至少須高出脚踝一吋</p>
<p>（四）做家庭雜務時，儘可能地坐了做。</p>
<p>（五）不要把鞋子留着當拖鞋用，走了樣的舊鞋祗會使你的脚受害，決不能使你得到安適之感。</p>
<p>（六）頂好不要每天穿同一雙鞋子，應當多買幾雙輪流穿，不但舒服，而且鞋子不易損壞。</p>
<p>（七）孩子們買鞋時必須帶他們去試穿，切忌帶了一只舊鞋去買新的。</p>
<p>（八）千萬不要打小算盤，把哥哥穿過的鞋子拿來給弟弟穿。事關你的孩子一生的幸福，切勿因小失大。</p>
<h3>澳洲的動物</h3>
<p>— 毛毅</p>
<p>澳大利亞的面積與美國相伯仲，但是它的人口祗有七百五十萬。</p>
<p>這裘是羊的國度，但是草地却極缺乏，養一頭羊需要二十畝地。普通一個養五千頭羊的小牧塲佔地亦達二十哩長，十呷寬。而大的牧塲則佔地一萬方哩之度。一個大牧塲在「豐收一的年頭可剪一百萬頭羊的毛</p>
<p>在上一個世紀，澳洲人輸入了少許的兎子，希望牠們繁衍之後供給肉食。但是，牠們繁衍得多到上億，反而與人爭食。於是，澳洲人爲了阻止牠們的勢力膨脹，便着手建築一道長一千一百三十九哩高四呎的籬笆。可是，在籬笆完工之前，籬內離外都有了兎子。現在，澳洲政府芷想輸入一種能殺兎子而對其他動物無害的疾病。</p>
<h3>皮胃肉</h3>
<p>韓國有先忠而後不忠者一人，曰李完用；又有先不甚忠，而後竟能忠者一人，曰朴永孝。古語云「蓋棺論定」，不到最後，不能判斷。李完用以韓內閣總理大臣之身分，一次與伊藤博文簽訂受統監指導之約（韓光武十一年，日明治四十年），一次與寺內正毅簽訂合併之約（韓隆熈四年，日明治四十三年）：而韓皇遂爲日京之李王焉。因此不但韓人志士戟指痛恨，　各國人士談及李完用之名，亦草不鄙夷。然當中日，俄日兩次戰役之間，李完用實爲抗日有力份子。閔妃被戕時，李氏奉　　入俄使館，發號施令，懲辦親日諸大臣，說俄以兵力助韓抑日，一年之久，日人畏而愛之，　絡絡百端，至俄日戰後，日勢已瀰漫全韓，乃與伊藤相結，供其驅策。初終易轍，殆亦環境使然歟？朴永孝則當二十年前，附和日方，改革韓政，得罪韓皇，避居日本，爲日人所指目之日黨，亦伊藤所心許。及任統監，薦於韓廷，擬授顯職，朴已深識其野心，力辭不就。後海牙事發，日方退韓皇退位，朴忽詣闕自請爲宮內大臣，保持印　，堅持不交，繼以韓人羣呼抵抗，日人謂是永孝指使，乃捕之下獄。以上兩節，均見梁滄江所著日本吞朝專記。</p>

<h3>Formal Sale of Five Unit Stocks: Purchasers Should Pay Attention to Profitability; 1,242,000 Gold Yuan Sold in a Single Day; China Textile Sales Are Best, Tianjin Paper Strangely Unpopular</h3>
<p>[Our Report] Stocks from five state-owned enterprises, including China Textile, began to be sold yesterday by the Bank of China, the Bank of Communications, the Farmers Bank of China, the Central Trust of China, and the Bank of Taiwan. There was a relatively enthusiastic response from the public at various bank branches. It is estimated that the five banks sold stocks from four units, including China Textile, Taiwan Sugar, Taiwan Paper, and China Merchants Bureau, for a total of 1,242,000 Gold Yuan in one day. China Textile had the best sales, totaling 794,000 Gold Yuan, followed by Taiwan Sugar Corporation at 368,500 Gold Yuan, then Taiwan Paper Corporation at 65,000 Gold Yuan. China Merchants Bureau ranked fourth at 14,500 Gold Yuan, while Tianjin Paper Corporation received no interest at all. This also demonstrates that investors are most concerned about the profitability and security of the enterprises.</p>
<p>In terms of sales figures by bank, the Bank of China had the highest amount, totaling 452,000 Gold Yuan, including 391,500 Gold Yuan for China Textile, 45,500 Gold Yuan for Taiwan Sugar, and 15,000 Gold Yuan for Taiwan Paper. Next was the Bank of Taiwan, totaling 273,800 Gold Yuan, including 223,800 Gold Yuan for Taiwan Sugar and 50,000 Gold Yuan for Taiwan Paper. The Bank of Communications was third, with 238,800 Gold Yuan, including 166,000 Gold Yuan for China Textile, 64,800 Gold Yuan for Taiwan Sugar, and 8,000 Gold Yuan for China Merchants Bureau. Fourth was the Farmers Bank of China, with 218,900 Gold Yuan, including 188,500 Gold Yuan for China Textile, 24,400 Gold Yuan for Taiwan Sugar, and 600 Gold Yuan for China Merchants Bureau. The Central Trust of China was last, with 58,500 Gold Yuan, including 48,000 Gold Yuan for China Textile, 10,000 Gold Yuan for Taiwan Sugar, and 500 Gold Yuan for China Merchants Bureau.</p>
<p>Of the companies mentioned above, only China Textile has formal stock certificates prepared. The others only have receipts for payment of shares. For those going to subscribe, only payments are accepted in the morning, and the banks issue temporary receipts. Formal stock certificates or payment receipts will be issued the next day upon presentation of the temporary receipt after the payment has been received. Those subscribing with cash will receive formal stock certificates or payment receipts on the spot.</p>

<h3>Remittance and Cash Transport Measures: Ministry of Finance Announces Cancellation</h3>

<h3>Zhang Qun Visits MacArthur Four Times; Scheduled to Return Home on the 13th; Today Will Broadcast to Japanese People in Japanese</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 10th] Zhang Qun is scheduled to return home on the 13th. He will have his fourth and final meeting with MacArthur from 6:00 PM to 8:00 PM on the 10th. On the morning of the 10th, Zhang attended a mass meeting of over a thousand overseas Chinese in Yokohama, delivering a brief speech advising them to abide by the laws of their self-selected place of residence, strive to educate themselves, and cooperate closely with each other. Zhang also told those present that the motherland has suffered greatly from the war, and reconstruction work requires their continuous contributions. On the 11th, Zhang will have lunch at the Foreign Correspondents' Club, making remarks to foreign reporters, and then the Chinese delegation will hold a press conference for Japanese reporters.</p>

<p>[Our Report, Nanjing, 10th] The implementation measures for banning the sale of imported luxury goods in the market were previously drafted by the Ministry of Industry and Commerce and submitted to the Executive Yuan meeting for discussion.

<h3>Traitor Wang Yitang Executed by Firing Squad: "I Want to Appeal!" He Shouted Before His Execution</h3>
<p>[Our Report, Beiping, 10th] The traitor Wang Yitang, chairman of the puppet North China Political Affairs Commission, was executed by firing squad at 10:00 AM on the 10th. He was killed by two bullets. The old traitor reversed his usual pretense of being confused and shouted repeatedly before his execution, "Please have mercy, Mr. President! I want to appeal!" In the end, he even sat up on his own and died by the bullets.</p>
<p>The traitor Wang was sentenced to death in all three trials. He received the Supreme Court's approval for the death sentence on the 8th. The warden visited him on the 9th, and he repeatedly shouted, "Warden, save me! Please help me find lawyer Liu Han. I still want to appeal!" His spirit was as usual, and he was still reluctant to give up his old life. He did not expect the execution to be so quick. The execution order arrived in Beiping at the same time as the approval on the 7th. The court kept it a secret in advance. The guards at the First Prison were surprised when they received the order to prepare this morning. Our reporter arrived. Prosecutor Shi Pingli signed the order to bring the traitor Wang at 9:50 AM. He had not been informed in advance. When the prison officials arrived, the traitor Wang had just finished a bowl of corn porridge and two pieces of cake. He was told that the court was in session today to investigate his illness. The court was in the prison, so he did not need to bring anything. Wang happily got on the stretcher, and two prison officials carried him out of the sick ward. He was covered with a gray plaid robe and a red plaid quilt. The old traitor's complexion was ruddy. His famous gray and white beard was as messy as thatch. He looked up at the sky, as if lost in thought. The case was handled in the execution ground in the backyard of the First Prison. The traitor Wang was placed in front of the case. The prosecutor asked, "Are you Wang Yitang?" Unexpectedly, the traitor Wang opened his mouth and answered, "Yes." He asked, "How old are you?" He answered, "Seventy-one years old." He asked, "Where do you live?" He answered, "I have no home." The prosecutor then softly informed him that he had received an order to execute him today. He asked, "Do you have a will?" He answered, "I want to appeal!" At this time, the traitor Wang showed signs of tension. The prosecutor told him that an appeal was not possible! He asked, "Do you have anything to say?" Wang still said that he was not clear-headed and could not say anything. "I want to appeal!" He was told again that the appeal had been rejected. "If you have nothing to say, then we will execute you!" Wang vaguely said, "Please have mercy, Mr. President!" He was asked again, "Do you have any property that needs to be handled?" He answered, "All my property has been lost." At this time, his upper and lower lips were tightly bitten. He then said intermittently, "Please have mercy, Mr. President." When the clerk read the original confession to Wang, he still listened attentively and then said again, "Please have mercy, Mr. President." At this time, after the photo was taken and fingerprints were taken, four people carried Wang out and placed him on the ground 20 meters away from the case. The firing squad police officer asked him if he could sit up. He surprisingly responded and sat up, put on his robe, and his pain before death was unexpectedly quick. After drinking the wine, the executing police officer aimed and fired four shots at a distance of one meter. None of the bullets left the barrel. After changing the gun, he picked up a bullet from the ground and loaded it. The fifth bullet finally fired, entering the back of his head and exiting from the front right. The traitor Wang leaned to the left, groaning and gasping, for three minutes. With his last breath, the inspector ordered another shot to be fired. Again, five bullets did not leave the barrel. The sixth bullet was fired, blowing a large hole in the old traitor's left brain, and the brain matter flowed out. Even then, he continued to convulse and gasp for five minutes before finally raising his head and expiring. Half an hour later, Wang Deyong, the traitor Wang's cousin, brought fresh fruit to visit him in prison. Only after arriving did he learn that he had been executed. After waiting for a while, Wang Weiyu, the traitor Wang's grand-nephew, arrived to collect the body for burial. The traitor Wang's two daughters are both in Shanghai. There are no other relatives in Beiping. The coffin had been purchased during his time as a puppet official and will be buried in the cemetery in the western suburbs. Afterwards, reporters inspected the traitor Wang's solitary sick ward, which contained a small iron bed with white sheets. There was a box of biscuits and a pile of old books, such as "Trial Selection Sequel," leaning against the east wall. In addition, there were salted eggs, apples, bananas, etc. A colored picture of Amitabha Buddha was nailed to the south wall. The old traitor believed in Buddhism, and this must have been the object of his daily prayers for his life.</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Increase Capital of Banks and Savings</h3>
<p>The adjustment method for commercial bank capital was approved at the Provisional Meeting of the Executive Yuan on the 4th of this month. This is the supplementary method to Article 30 of the Measures for Consolidating Finances and Strengthening Economic Control. The stipulations therein include: (1) Those not meeting the minimum capital amount should increase it within two months; (2) Setting minimum capital amounts by district; (3) The total amount of asset appreciation should not exceed 50% of the total amount to be increased, with the remainder to be paid in cash; and (4) Those failing to increase capital to the full amount by the deadline will be ordered to suspend business by the Ministry. All these points are fully in line with the principles of the above-mentioned article. In addition to setting capital amounts by district and category, additional capital increases are specified for the establishment of trust or savings departments and branch offices in different cities and counties, and several standards and restrictions have been drafted for the revaluation of existing assets.</p>
<p>One of the most important points is Article 3, which sets the minimum capital amount for commercial, industrial, and savings banks, as well as trust companies, in Shanghai, Tianjin, and Guangzhou. For organizations structured as limited liability companies or companies limited by shares, the amount is set at 500,000 Gold Yuan. Other company structures are halved, and money shops are halved again. This is a uniform reduction of half from the originally proposed standard of one million yuan. It cannot be denied that this is a lenient measure to accommodate the difficulties of businesses, and it is based on the bank law before the war, so it cannot be said to be without basis. According to insiders, the total capital of all banks and money shops in Shanghai before the war was about 400 million yuan, which accounted for only about one-tenth of the total deposits of 4 billion yuan at that time, and only a little more than one-third of the total issuance of 1.4 billion yuan at that time. However, the deposits of the largest commercial bank in Shanghai now are only more than 700 billion, which is equivalent to only more than 230,000 Gold Yuan. Its minimum capital amount is at least more than twice the deposit amount. For most of the other banks and money shops with lower deposit amounts, the multiple is even more considerable. It should be noted that as a result of the depreciation of currency, the capital of the first-class banks before the war, which had fully paid up 5 million, 7 million, and 10 million yuan, is now less than 5 Gold Yuan when converted into Gold Yuan if they have not increased their capital. But 500,000 Gold Yuan, when converted into legal tender, has reached 1.5 trillion yuan, which is quite a large amount. Although the law allows up to 50% of the original assets to be revalued as collateral, it requires that all capital increases be completed within a short period of two months, and the increased cash must be deposited in the Central Bank and cannot be used for three months unless approved by the competent authority for legitimate purposes. This seems to be a huge burden for the banks themselves.</p>
<p>However, the government's reason for forcing adjustments and increasing their capital amount is to strengthen their financial resources and consolidate their credit. There are now more than 6,000 banks and money shops nationwide. Whether this number is excessive is a matter of opinion, but it is an undisputed fact that some banks and money shops are indeed weak, there are too many units in certain specific areas, competition is too fierce, expenses are too high, and their legitimate business is difficult to develop, resulting in them engaging in the purchase and sale of goods. Moreover, the trend is that banks in various countries are consolidating and gradually merging. Article 9 of the adjustment method clearly states: "Banks that are unable to increase capital according to the law will jointly reorganize and merge several banks." This is also an appropriate measure to follow the trend, not only to leave a way out for these weaker banks.</p>
<p>As everyone knows, all financial institutions conduct business by lending and receiving credit. Therefore, strong financial resources and a solid foundation are important conditions for business development. However, this is only one of the conditions for business development. Any bank or money shop that relies solely on its own funds to operate will find its power limited. Because capital is equal to the fund, its operation is entirely based on deposits. An increase in deposits is the real enrichment of its power. Since inflation, everyone has valued goods over money and is unwilling to save, resulting in a flood of floating capital and a daily decrease in deposits. Therefore, banks and money shops cannot even talk about development. For example, if they receive a large loan, they have to rediscount or re-mortgage to the national bank tenfold, otherwise they will have no way to transfer it. As for normal lending, the interest rate is high and the term is extremely short, which has long lost the meaning of supporting industry and commerce. This is not to say that they disregard their responsibilities and intentionally ignore their inherent tasks, nor is it necessarily due to a shortage of capital that they cannot take care of their due transactions. It is simply that there are too few deposits and turnover is difficult, especially time deposits, which are less than one-tenth of current deposits. In addition to short-term lending for meager profits, they really cannot help with the legitimate financing of general customers.</p>
<p>Therefore, we believe that the increase in bank capital should be viewed in several ways: First, from the perspective of diverting floating capital, it is of course very correct. Because in Shanghai alone, the total number of commercial banks, trust companies, and money shops is nearly 200. If each one increases its capital by 300,000, it can absorb 60 million Gold Yuan, which is equivalent to 180 trillion Legal Yuan, which is slightly less than one-third of the total issuance. Even if half of it can be offset by existing assets, the floating capital absorbed is still a very large amount. Second, from the perspective of enhancing the financial strength of banks and money shops, it is the right medicine for the disease, and there is no need to repeat it. Third, from the perspective of supporting industry and commerce, it is still necessary to use various methods to encourage savings and vigorously cultivate the deposits of banks and money shops. According to the deposit statistics of Shanghai banks and money shops in July recently released by the Audit Department of the Central Bank, although the number of current deposits increased by more than 90% compared with June, time deposits only increased by more than 2%, and the total number of time deposits is still only one-tenth of current deposits. It can be seen that most of these funds are still temporarily deposited, and banks and money shops are still unable to use them in large quantities. In other words, industry and commerce still cannot benefit from sufficient financing. Therefore, in addition to increasing the capital of banks and money shops, we still hope that the government and all sectors of society will quickly start with promoting savings to build a sound foundation for the national economy. As for how to arouse the interest of the general public in saving, it is related to the stability of prices, so the government's full efforts to promote the stability of general prices is the most important task at present.</p>
<h3>Suppressing the Hoarding of Daily Necessities. Supplementary Key Points for Implementation Methods. The Ministry of Industry and Commerce Issues Orders to All Localities for Implementation</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing dispatch on the 10th] In order to cooperate with the implementation of the Emergency Disposition Order for Financial and Economic Affairs, the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, based on the "Methods for Suppressing Hoarding and Profiteering of Important Daily Necessities" promulgated in January of this year, has drafted "Supplementary Key Points for Implementing the Methods for Suppressing Hoarding and Profiteering of Important Daily Necessities." It has been submitted to the Political Affairs Conference for approval and was issued to the Ministry of Industry and Commerce on the 10th to order localities to begin implementation. The full text of the supplementary key points of the methods is as follows:</p>
<p>Supplementary Key Points for Implementing the Methods for Suppressing Hoarding and Profiteering of Important Daily Necessities:</p>
<p>(1) From August 19, 1948, non-merchants or non-specialty merchants purchasing suppressed goods in all parts of the country should not exceed the amount needed for three months per person if the goods are for direct consumption. If the goods are needed for the business of specialty merchants, they should not exceed one-fourth of the annual amount needed (except for seasonal goods). Violators will be deemed to be hoarding, and the limits that should be suppressed may be determined by the local competent authorities based on the above standards, the categories of goods, and the supply and demand situation.</p>
<p>(2) If the finished products and goods stored in factories and commercial firms in various places are not supplied to the market as much as possible or the price is raised beyond the Gold Yuan price converted according to the exchange rate on August 19, 1948, without the approval of the local competent authorities, it will be deemed as profiteering.</p>
<p>(3) Factories and commercial firms in various parts of the country that purchase and sell suppressed goods should report the output, purchase, sales, and inventory (finished products, raw materials, and important materials) of the previous month to the trade association in the first ten days of each month, which will then be forwarded to the local competent authorities for verification.</p>
<p>(4) For important cities designated by the Executive Yuan, the local competent authorities should implement warehouse inspection methods jointly with the relevant agencies, which should be formulated by the local competent authorities based on the actual local situation, submitted to the superior agency in charge for approval, and forwarded to the Executive Yuan and the Ministry of Industry and Commerce for record.</p>
<p>(5) If the local competent authorities in places other than those mentioned in the previous article deem it necessary, they may submit a request to the Executive Yuan for approval, ordering local warehouses to report on a regular basis the names, addresses, occupations, types, quantities, and storage dates of the goods stored in the warehouses, and may conduct inspections when necessary.</p>
<p>(6) Article 17 of the Methods for Suppressing Hoarding and Profiteering of Important Daily Necessities states that if one of the following circumstances occurs, the hoarded goods may be confiscated by the competent authorities, "and a fine of up to 1,000 yuan may be imposed," which is changed to "and a fine of up to 1,000 Gold Yuan may be imposed."</p>
<p>(7) The local competent authorities for implementing the Methods for Suppressing Hoarding of Important Daily Necessities are the Bureau of Social Affairs or the Department of Social Affairs (handling matters in conjunction with public security and police agencies) in municipalities directly under the central government and provincial capitals, and the county and city governments in counties and cities.</p>

<h3>The Thailand Democratic Party Drafts a New Plan. Restricting the Development of Our Overseas Chinese. Stipulating that Chinese Shops Employ Siamese People as Assistant Managers</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency Bangkok, 10th] The Thailand Democratic Party yesterday drafted a plan to restrict the free development of Chinese here, which is very similar in form to what the Philippines had previously formulated. According to this new plan, all Chinese shops and warehouses must hire Siamese people as assistant managers, and the proportion of Siamese people employed must not be less than 50%. According to this, even small shops selling odds and ends must employ at least one Siamese person as an assistant manager. However, it is believed that even if the Thailand Parliament passes this bill, its implementation will be as difficult as expected. The reason is that the majority of Chinese in Thailand already have dual nationality, and if the Siamese government decides to force them to dismiss half of their original employees and hire a batch of completely inexperienced Siamese people instead, it will inevitably cause great turmoil in the market.</p>

<h3>300,000 Berlin Citizens Demonstrate Against Communism; Soviet Troops Open Fire, Resulting in Bloodshed; 20-30 Killed or Wounded in Desperate Pursuit of Freedom</h3>
<p>[United Press Berlin, 9th] This afternoon, nine or ten Soviet soldiers opened fire with hand-held machine guns on 300,000 non-communist demonstrators in the British zone of Berlin.  According to Ames, a correspondent for this agency who witnessed the event, he saw one person fall. He estimates that the Soviet troops fired approximately 60 rounds.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse Berlin, 9th] Berlin residents, resisting the Communist Party's destruction of Berlin's freedom, gathered in the British zone for a large-scale demonstration. Near the end of the demonstration, the situation near the "Victory Gate" on the border between the British and Soviet zones suddenly became tense.  Demonstrators threw stones at Soviet police jeeps, and some climbed onto the "Victory Gate" and tore down Allied flags.  Soviet police fired warning shots into the air, while German police under Soviet control shot and wounded 20-30 demonstrators. At the beginning of the demonstration, the crowds marched in formation, maintaining order, each carrying banners and flags with slogans such as "No freedom, no socialism" and "Strive for freedom in the Soviet sector of Berlin," etc.  The demonstration was originally organized through broadcasts in four languages by the American zone's radio station. Shops and factories in the British, American, and French zones all closed at noon in response.  The main body of the demonstration was led by the red, black, and gold Weimar Republic flag. Social Democratic Party leaders gave speeches to the demonstrators, denouncing the current situation as no different from the Nazi era. The Mayor of Berlin strongly condemned the attack on the City Hall by rioters, saying, "This is the beginning of the destruction of freedom. We want to fight for the freedom that citizens should receive, and we will never recognize the control of the City Council by rioters. Our task is to defend Berlin, and we will fight to the death for freedom."</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse Berlin, 9th] According to authorities, in today's anti-demonstration, in addition to two German police officers from the Soviet sector being stoned to death by the crowd, approximately 20-30 demonstrators were shot and wounded.  The German police opened fire because demonstrators climbed onto the "Victory Gate" and tore down the Soviet flag.  The German police immediately shot and wounded six or seven flag-tearers, two of whom were seriously injured. At this time, a jeep of Soviet sector police arrived, and the crowd attacked the police jeep with stones. The police then opened fire again, wounding several people. After the police opened fire, Soviet representatives went to the border of the British zone to discuss the situation with British military police representatives. The demonstrators were then driven back by British military police, and the situation was prevented from escalating further.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse Berlin, 9th] The ADN German news agency, registered in the Soviet sector, claimed that today's demonstration was instigated by fascist youth affiliated with the Social Democratic Party. They stormed into the Soviet sector, climbed onto the Victory Gate, and threw stones at pedestrians. Soviet sector police were therefore forced to open fire to stop the demonstration. The fascist youth were clearly willing to do anything to provoke a bloody incident. The news agency estimated that the demonstration involved about 300,000 people.</p>
<h3>Three Envoys Receive New Instructions; Preparing to Meet Molotov; British Prime Minister, Despite Illness, Presides Over Emergency Cabinet Meeting</h3>
<p>[Our Own Report] London, 10th (broadcast from Moscow).  Western envoys have reportedly received new instructions from their governments and will meet to discuss them on the 10th. It is understood that the three-nation envoys may request another meeting with Molotov to discuss the Berlin situation and the upcoming Four Power Foreign Ministers Conference.</p>
<p>[Our Own Report] London, 10th (broadcast). Bevin reviewed the Berlin issue at a cabinet meeting on the 10th, and raised three possible courses of action regarding the attitude Britain should take: (1) end negotiations with the Allies; (2) continue negotiations; (3) continue negotiations, but demand that the Soviet Union explain the purpose of the Berlin harassment.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse London, 9th] The British Foreign Office stated that the situation resulting from today's demonstration in Berlin is "very serious". At the same time, US Ambassador Douglas, French Ambassador Massigli, and British Undersecretary of State Strang met to discuss the latest reports from Berlin.</p>
<p>[United Press London, 10th] The British cabinet on the 10th studied several possible "second steps" to deal with the Berlin crisis.  At the same time, a Foreign Office spokesman expressed regret over the "series of events" in that area, saying that the frequent incidents posed a problem for Soviet agreements. The cabinet held its first full cabinet meeting in six weeks to consider the Berlin crisis. Prime Minister Attlee, although bedridden with duodenal disease and a foot ailment, struggled to leave the hospital and attend to preside. However, the focus of attention was the heavily pregnant Foreign Secretary Bevin. Bevin gave a long account to the cabinet ministers of the failure of the summer negotiations with the Soviet Union and the recent unexpected events in Berlin. Bevin especially emphasized the Soviet army's shooting on the 9th at anti-communist demonstrators who tore down the Soviet flag. The special session of Parliament is about to open next week, and the cabinet is busy preparing, but serious problems are coming one after another, such as: (1) Whether the West intends to continue negotiations with the Soviet Union in Berlin or Moscow to reach an agreement on the German currency system and the Berlin blockade? (2) What measures will the West take to deal with the escalating unrest in Berlin? (3) How much information does Bevin intend to reveal in his report to the parliament next week about the negotiations with the Soviet Union? (4) What will Defense Minister Alexander say to explain the delay in the three-year demobilization and the extension of the term of service when reporting to the members of the parliament? Although there are many problems, everyone is concerned about Berlin. The series of events in that area is increasingly affecting East-West relations. People here are particularly concerned about the events of the evening of the 9th, and anticipate that the Soviet Union will lodge a strong protest because the national flag was removed and torn apart, stating that it is more brutal than the Nazis.</p>
<h3>German Social Democratic Party Plans to Expose the Soviet Political Police's Atrocities</h3>

<p>[Agence France-Presse Paris, 10th] Queuille continued to consult with various parties on cabinet formation matters, and the chances of success have increased compared to before. After his consultation with Socialist Party leader Ramadier, Queuille declared that the Socialist Party had decided to sacrifice its economic and financial policies and give its full support to his cabinet formation, which is an indispensable condition for his cabinet formation. Socialist Party leader Ramadier also stated that the situation is progressing favorably, and if Queuille attends the National Assembly this afternoon, he may receive the support of a majority of members. Independent Republican Party leader Chriscinguet told the press that the situation has not yet reached the point where his party can issue a clear statement of its position.</p>
<p>[United Press Paris, 9th] French police and government guards clashed on the 9th with about 100 protesters attempting to break into the Élysée Palace. Both the French Communist Party and De Gaulle's faction are trying to prevent the formation of a new French government. The short-lived clash occurred outside the presidential palace where President Auriol resides. Protesters threw stones from the paving of the sidewalks at the military police, while others used chairs from sidewalk cafes as weapons, but the military police were strong enough and the protesters were dispersed. De Gaulle's supporters have openly called for new general elections, while French Communist leader Thorez addressed party members, calling for the Communist Party to participate in the government.</p>

<h3>Soviets Restricting Berlin Airlift; US Resolutely Rejects</h3>
<p>[Our Own Report] London, 10th (broadcast from Berlin): The Soviet Union's attempt to restrict the American airlift to Berlin has been rejected by the US authorities. The Soviet Union officially informed the Berlin Four Power Air Safety Center, requesting the US to notify the Soviet Union of the details of each airlift before takeoff, saying that this measure was necessary "for safety considerations." The US Air Force replied that American pilots are able to comply with the Four Power flight rules, and that the information provided to the Soviet Union on a daily basis is sufficient to meet their needs. The Soviet Union's request came only half a day after the anti-communist demonstration in Berlin resulted in a bloody tragedy. According to a US Air Force officer, the Soviet Union's true intention is to control the American airlift to Berlin.</p>
<h3>North Korea Cables US and Soviet Governments Requesting Withdrawal of Troops from North and South Korea; Full List of New North Korean Cabinet Released</h3>
<p>[New Asia, Seoul, 10th] According to a Pyongyang broadcast, the first resolution of the first meeting of the North Korean Supreme People's Assembly on the 9th was to cable the US and Soviet governments to withdraw troops from both North and South Korea simultaneously. The cable stated: "It has been three years since Korea was liberated from Japanese oppression, but what the Korean people expect - complete independence - has not yet materialized. Due to the separate occupation by the US and Soviet armies, the division of Korea has been formed, causing the Korean people to suffer various economic, political, and cultural pains. The Japanese troops in Korea have long been disarmed and repatriated to Japan. There is no longer any need for the US and Soviet Union to station troops in Korea.</p>
<p>People without confidence generally claim that a civil war will break out in Korea after the withdrawal of US and Soviet troops, but all parties participating in the People's Republic, regardless of left, right, or center factions, can guarantee that no civil war will occur. On September 26, 1947, the Soviet side proposed a simultaneous withdrawal, and the US military also proposed a withdrawal. We express our deep gratitude for this, and again ask the governments of the two countries to withdraw their troops from Korea simultaneously."</p>
<p>[New Asia, Seoul, 10th] According to a Pyongyang broadcast, the new cabinet of the North Korean People's Republic has been organized, and the list is as follows:</p>
<p>Premier of the Cabinet: Kim Il-sung, Deputy Premiers: Park Hon-yong, Hong Myong-hui, Kim Chaek. Chairman of the National Planning Commission: Chung Chun.

<h3>The Establishment of the Berlin Agreement in the Yalta Conference by the US and the Soviet Union is Not a Fact; "The Hopkins Memoirs" Revealed</h3>
<p>[United Press Washington, 9th] Collier's magazine published "The Hopkins Memoirs" edited by Sherwood on the 9th, saying that the United States did not agree at the Yalta talks that Soviet troops should enter Berlin first, and if possible, the United States planned to capture Berlin itself. Hopkins wrote this memoir before the San Francisco Conference to deny the news published by columnist Pearson in April 1945. According to Pearson's article, the reason why the American troops who arrived outside Berlin withdrew was because an agreement was reached with the Soviet Union in Yalta that Soviet troops should enter Berlin first. Hopkins called this statement "completely inaccurate" and said that in fact this issue was not discussed at all in Yalta. He said that the Western Allied military leaders and senior Soviet strategic officials all agreed that "we should all strive to move forward." Hopkins continued that the claim that General Bradley stopped at the Elbe River at the request of the Soviet Union to allow Soviet troops to enter Berlin first was also inaccurate. Bradley did have a division of the army approaching Potsdam at the time, but the division was too far forward and had completely insufficient supplies. Anyone with a little military knowledge knows that if we could have entered Berlin, we would have captured it. If so, it would have been an honor for the Army Department." Schert elaborated on Hopkins's last visit to Moscow to negotiate President Truman's meeting with Premier Stalin in Potsdam after the war. He said that Stalin told Hopkins at the time that he firmly believed that Hitler was not dead, "and had escaped by submarine."</p>
<h3>Korean Envoy Cho Pyong-ok Arrives in Japan to See MacArthur</h3>
<p>He will transfer to Paris to attend the UN General Assembly</p>
<p>[United Press Tokyo, 10th] Korean special envoy Dr. Cho Pyong-ok held a press conference here on the 10th. He declared that Korea hopes that American troops will remain stationed in South Korea indefinitely until the communist threat is lifted from North Korea. Although he did not point out the Soviet Union, he expressed his concern that the power of the Soviet Union and the North Korean Communists will penetrate South Korea, causing the greatest obstacles to the development of the new Korea. Dr. Cho arrived here on the 9th from Washington and New York on his way to Paris. He met with the Secretary General of the United Nations. Cho then visited Sebald, head of the Allied Command's Diplomatic Section, and then met with MacArthur. He said that the purpose of his visit to MacArthur was to thank MacArthur for personally attending the ceremony for the establishment of the Republic of Korea in Seoul.</p>
<p>[New Asia Tokyo, 10th] Dr. Cho Pyong-ok, the special envoy of the Republic of Korea to China, the Philippines, and the United States, met with reporters at the Imperial Hotel on the 10th and said: "The formal start of Korean-Japanese relations will be after the conclusion of the peace treaty with Japan.

<h3>Second Meeting of the Senate Assembly; Quiet Atmosphere in Nine Bureaus' Interrogation; Group Review Meetings to be Held Today and Tomorrow</h3>
<p>[Our Own Report] The first session of the seventh meeting of the Shanghai Municipal Senate was held at 3:30 p.m. yesterday in the assembly hall of the Senate. 142 senators attended, and Mayor Wu, Secretary-General Shen, and the heads of the city government's bureaus and departments were present. First, Speaker Pan reported that today's agenda was for senators to raise questions to the nine bureaus of finance, education, land administration, public utilities, public works, police, civil affairs, health, and social affairs, and for the heads of each to answer them separately. However, as time was limited, please seize the opportunity as much as possible. Then the interrogation began. The number of questions raised yesterday was less than in previous assemblies. Only one person raised questions to the Finance Bureau and the Civil Affairs Bureau. More questions were raised to the Education, Public Utilities, and Social Affairs Bureaus, but the content was mediocre and there was no climax. All the questions were completed at 7:15, and the meeting adjourned immediately. There will be no assembly today and tomorrow. Group review meetings will be held separately. The third meeting will continue on the day after tomorrow (the 13th) from 3:00 p.m. to 7:00 p.m. to discuss proposals.</p>
<p>House Donation and Land Price Tax Must Be Adjusted</p>
<p>The senators' questions to the bureaus were as follows: Finance Section; Only Jiang Hao raised questions. Director Tian replied that the bureau has thoroughly investigated the matter of merchants colluding to delay the payment of business tax to make a profit. No similar cases have been found, but several cases of attempted extortion have been found and have been sent to the court for investigation. As for business tax, which is the lifeblood of the municipal government, the bureau is determined to find ways to collect it as scheduled. In the past, the Finance Bureau collected last year's taxes this year, but now it has achieved collecting this quarter's taxes this quarter. The Finance Bureau has always taken into account the people's burden and is unwilling to create new items to collect taxes. However, as things stand now, it is impossible to maintain and it is necessary to moderately adjust the house donation and land price tax to make up for it.</p>
<p>Schools in the Zhabei District are Occupied and Cannot Be Dealt With</p>
<p>Education Section: The questioners included Zhang Zhihan, Jiang Haoran, Ji Xia, Zhang Ji, etc. Director Li gave the following comprehensive answers: (1) The Senate previously resolved to increase the number of classes by 200. The reason why they have not been added is because the municipal government's finances are stretched and it cannot proceed. With the approval of the mayor, 53 classes have been temporarily added, and more will be added in the future. (2) The matter of donating schools has not proceeded because some unscrupulous people took advantage of it, causing disputes. In the future, the Education Bureau will allow the establishment of schools with definite addresses, property rights, and title deeds. The funds for donating schools in the previous period have already been issued. (3) Schools in the Zhabei District were occupied during the enemy and puppet period, and were forcibly occupied by soldiers after the victory and have not been moved out. The Education Bureau is in a very difficult situation, because military agencies are not only impossible for educational agencies to deal with, but even government agencies are helpless. It is now planned to ask the Garrison Command for assistance. (4) The Education Bureau has repeatedly submitted documents to the central government for the subsidy fees for the losses suffered by schools in the Zhabei and other districts due to the war, but all have been unanswered. The power is not in our hands, and we can only sigh that we have more than enough heart but not enough strength. (5) To popularize education, more municipal schools must be established. The Education Bureau will do its best. As for increasing education funds, it will also strive for it. It has been found that the percentage of education funds in the city this year is 22.5%, while according to the central government's regulations after the implementation of the constitution, the funds of the municipalities should be more than 35%. (6) The conflict between the principal and teachers of Boai Primary School due to the distribution issue has now been resolved. The Education Bureau will investigate the truth again. If the situation is serious, they will be dismissed. (7) There are no schools within three or four miles near the 8th district of Longhua District, making it difficult to attend school. It is hoped that the local authorities can plan to add them, and the Education Bureau will assist.</p>
<p>People's Land Not Yet Returned Due to Military Priority</p>
<p>Land Administration Section: The questioners included Cao Jun, Yu Chuanding, and Qu Cheng, etc. Director Zhu replied as follows: (1) During the enemy and puppet period, 340,000 mu of people's land in the Jiangwan District were enclosed and occupied. The people's land occupied by the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry, the Zhenru Radio Station, and the Longhua Airport was quite large. The reason why it has not been returned is because most of the occupants belong to military agencies. Repeated contacts have yielded no results. During the period of suppression of the rebellion, the central government clearly ordered that military affairs should be given priority. Therefore, except for a part that has been returned, the rest has been requisitioned by various agencies at a price. After the senators went to Beijing to petition, the establishment of the review committee was approved. The Ministry of National Defense, the Ministry of Communications, and other departments sent representatives to participate and resolved to complete the clearing within three months. Seven cases have been resolved, and the rest will be reviewed as soon as possible, and the resolutions will be sent back to the owners. (2) The Land Administration Bureau is too slow to handle affairs and the procedures are cumbersome. It will continue to improve in the future. (3) The valuation work cannot be as ideal as it should be due to the impact of price fluctuations. It can be improved in the future.</p>
<h3>City Ferry Service Ends Too Early; Should Find Ways to Appropriately Extend Hours</h3>
<p>Public Utilities Section: Councilors who raised questions included Chen Peide, Shi Zongde, Wang Guoxian, etc. Director Zhao Zengjue responded comprehensively as follows: (1) The city ferry service stops too early at night, causing inconvenience for travel to and from Puxi. This is to save gasoline and diesel. It is proposed that the city ferry company appropriately extend the sailing hours based on the number of passengers on each route. (2) The power supply in the Jiangwan area is not normal, mainly because there are many military institutions in the area, which waste a great deal of electricity during peacetime. Measures must be taken to avoid this. It is hoped that the military institutions will restrain their subordinates slightly so that the power supply in Jiangwan can return to normal. (3) The water supply problem in the western district of Shanghai is currently being vigorously improved. The self-flowing system is expected to be completed by the end of this year. 18-inch water pipes will be installed from Xietu Road, Jinyi Bridge, to Wanping Road and the intersection of Avenue Petain. After completion, it should be able to supply 100,000 households every day. (4) Transportation companies feel quite difficult after the gasoline price increase. According to the Executive Yuan's approval, only public utility oil is allowed to be priced at the old price of 819. The price of oil for transportation companies must be approved by the Executive Yuan, and the Public Utilities Bureau will provide assistance.</p>
<h3>Repairing Hongqiao Road Has Nothing to Do with the Wealthy</h3>
<p>Public Works Section: Councilors who raised questions included Zhang Zhongyuan, Yan Esheng, Xi Xia, etc. Director Zhao Zukang responded as follows: (1) The phenomenon of water accumulation on the roads has indeed improved compared to before the war. There is no longer water accumulation on Jiangsu Road and Route Tenant de Tournon. Conditions in the former French Concession have also improved. The Public Works Bureau complains about being poor every day, and the progress of various projects is indeed hindered. (2) The work of repairing suburban areas has already begun. Repairing Hongqiao Road is not because it is a road used by the wealthy and prominent in that area. Other major roads will also be under construction. (3) Cracking down on illegal construction is the duty of the Public Works Bureau. It is hoped that citizens will report such cases, and the Public Works Bureau will thoroughly enforce the law. (4) The accumulation of debris along the roads in the Yangshupu area obstructs traffic and measures will be taken to remove it.</p>
<h3>Police Officers' Attitudes are Unsatisfactory; Strict Attention Should be Paid</h3>
<p>Police Affairs Section: Councilors who raised questions included Shi Zongde, Chen Peide, Wang Guoxian, Pan Jiemei, etc. Director Yu Shuping responded as follows: (1) The reason why the new house numbers after the reorganization have not yet been issued is because they have not yet been completely sorted out and will be distributed uniformly within days. (2) The reason for the increase in the price of rickshaws, according to the rickshaw pullers, is that the fines have increased sharply. According to the regulations, the fine for vehicle violations was changed to 1.6 jiao after the currency reform. Later, after the National Government announced the restoration of the pre-war regulations, it was changed to collecting more than one yuan and less than sixty yuan. (3) Police officers' service spirit in the police stations is not good, and they sometimes arbitrarily make fun of citizens, and often shirk responsibility in the event of accidents. Strict attention should be paid to this, and if discovered, punishment will be added.</p>
<p>Self-Defense Corps Not Yet Realized Due to Lack of Funding</p>
<p>Civil Affairs Section: Only Li Hua raised a question, asking why the People's Self-Defense Corps has not yet been realized. Director Zhang Xiaosong replied: The budget and plan have been prepared, but the reason for not realizing it is due to lack of funding. Once funding is available, it can be organized.</p>
<p>No Price Increases for Western Medicine Heard of; Selling Diseased Pigs is Inaccurate</p>
<p>Health Section: Councilors who raised questions included Zhang Zhihan, Fan Shoujian, Chen Peide, etc. Director Zhang Wei responded: (1) Prices absolutely adhere to the price limit. The statement that prices exceed the old price of 819 is absolutely inaccurate. However, if the boatmen arbitrarily raise prices during transportation, it is beyond the control of the Health Bureau. (2) No price increases for Western medicine have been heard of so far. If black market prices are found, it is hoped that they will be reported. (3) The rumor that pigs are sold at the market at parity prices is definitely not true, because the Health Bureau's inspection has always been very strict. (4) The matter of establishing a traditional Chinese medicine hospital is being discussed with the Ministry of Health.</p>
<h3>No Goods Being Replenished is Absolutely Not True</h3>
<p>Social Affairs Section: Councilors who raised questions included Zhang Zhongyuan, Yan Esheng, Chai Zikai, Fan Xipin, etc. Director Wu Kaixian responded: (1) The statement that merchants are panicked that goods cannot be replenished after the strict price limit is absolutely not true. It is purely a morbid psychology of the merchants. If there are indeed difficulties, they can report to the Social Affairs Bureau so that wholesalers can be sanctioned. (2) Although cigarettes are not daily necessities, if they are purchased in large quantities with the intention of hoarding, it is also a violation of the law and should be banned. (3) The use of US aid as funding for the Rural Reconstruction Committee of this city is because Shanghai citizens have already enjoyed the rice allocation portion of US aid, and the remaining funds will be used for the reconstruction of other rural areas.</p>

(2) The Agricultural Friendship Association petitioned for assistance in the dispute with the old cloth industry association over stall allocation.</p>
<h3>Essential Goods Warehouses to be Inspected Starting Next Week</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] Jiang Jingguo convened a meeting with Yan Guoxing, Lin Chong, Zhang Shi, and relevant personnel in the morning at ten o'clock to discuss in detail the crackdown on gold, banknotes, stock black market transactions, and decided to strengthen control. Warehouses of daily necessities will be inspected starting next week. If hoarding or other situations are found, they will be confiscated and the perpetrators will be severely punished.</p>
<h3>Jiang Jingguo Encourages the Industrial Sector to Promote the New Economic Policy; Shanghai's Stability Depends on Workers' Cooperation</h3>
<p>Shanghai Economic Supervisor Jiang Jingguo, since his arrival in Shanghai to preside over the implementation of the new economic policy plan, has been very effective in stabilizing prices. The city's industrial sector, to express their respect, held a grand welcome meeting at the City Stadium on Southwest Shaanxi Road at 3:00 PM yesterday. In addition to Mr. Jiang, those who attended included Vice Minister Lu of the Central Agricultural and Industrial Department, Director Wu of the Social Affairs Bureau, Director Shui of the Trade Union Council, and more than 3,000 directors and supervisors of trade unions throughout the city. After Mr. Jiang arrived, the workers applauded enthusiastically, and the sound shook the building for a long time. Director Wu gave a brief introduction, and Supervisor Jiang gave a speech in the midst of cheers, encouraging comrades in the industrial sector to assist in the implementation of the new economic plan. He said that the general public believes that Shanghai is a wealthy place, but in fact, most people are extremely poor. Those who enjoy happiness are not representatives of the people of Shanghai. The majority of workers and farmers can represent the true people of Shanghai. Due to the manipulation of speculators, legitimate productive industries are being suppressed, which is a violation of the Three Principles of the People, because the Three Principles of the People support honest and legitimate industries, protect producers, and overthrow non-producers. The implementation of the new economic policy this time is a revolution to transform society and eliminate unfair phenomena in society. In the future, anyone who destroys finance will be severely punished. Shanghai's stability requires the elimination of those who make war fortunes, speculators, adventurers, and bad merchants. This depends on the unity and cooperation of workers throughout the city. It is hoped that trade union comrades will continue to cooperate, generate new forces, transform the old evil environment, and our mission can be successful. Finally, Shui Xiangzhai gave a reply. The meeting adjourned at around 5:00 PM.</p>

This afternoon at 3:00 PM, he will host the economic editors of various newspapers.</p>

<h3>Supervisor Concerned About Cigarette Issue; Calls for Discussions with the Tobacco Industry; Five-Point Decision on Solutions</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] The supply of cigarettes in this city is difficult to purchase due to the manufacturers' low shipment, wholesalers' refusal to sell inventory, and scalpers' rush to purchase retail shipments, resulting in a shortage in the market. Supervisor Jiang Jingguo is very concerned about this issue and sent Yang Qingying of the Suppression and Construction Brigade to the Social Affairs Bureau yesterday morning to inquire about the details and discuss strengthening control matters.

(2) The finished products of factories producing daily necessities should all be purchased by the government, and funds and raw materials should be provided to enable them to have reproductive capacity. (3) Daily necessities should be distributed by the government in accordance with the population. (4) The control of commodity prices and the adjustment of materials throughout the country should have unified and effective methods.

<h3>Ten Years in a Flash; The Mint "Resurrects"; Ordered to Actively Reorganize; Opens Casting on the 11th of Next Month</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Special] Since the currency reform order was announced, everyone knows that the busiest agencies are the Economic Supervisor's Office, the Central Bank, the Economic Police, and the Suppression and Construction Brigade, but few people know that the tension of the work of the Central Mint is no less than that of the above agencies. They are preparing to resurrect the mint, which has been paralyzed for ten years and is the leading mint in the country, within two months. This is almost an impossible miracle, because the plant suffered too much loss during the war. The machine factory buildings were either dismantled or destroyed, and almost all the equipment was lost. However, all the employees of the factory deeply know the importance of the mission entrusted by the times, and under the leadership of Director Wei Xianzhang, they worked day and night to repair and determined to complete the great task of resuming work.</p>
<p>On August 10, Minister Wang of the Ministry of Finance summoned Director Wei to Beijing by telegram without explaining the reason and limited Director Wei to resume work at the mint within half a month for no apparent reason. Director Wei almost suspected that the minister had gone mad under the order. Is such a short time possible? However, subordinates are not allowed to resist their superiors and silently accepted the order. After returning to Shanghai on the 11th, he immediately summoned the old staff and started to reorganize on the 15th. The currency reform order was issued on the 19th, and all the employees realized what was happening and their spirits were greatly boosted, and the reorganization work progressed rapidly. Director Wei told reporters yesterday with great certainty: The trial operation will be on the first of October, and official resumption of work will be possible on the eleventh of October. The first thing to be cast will be the half-yuan silver subsidiary coin and the one-cent copper coin. 10,000 ounces of silver will be transported from the Central Bank within days. The silver dollars that are now being collected by various banks will be the raw materials here in the future. Various copper-nickel subsidiary coins returned by Japan will also be sent to the factory for reorganization and recasting. The mold for the half-yuan silver coin is still being engraved. The front side is the president's portrait, and the center of the back side is the words "half yuan". Underneath is double grain ear, and on top is the words "Republic of China 37th Year" (see picture). Each silver coin weighs five grams, with 80% pure silver and 20% electrolytic copper. The size is as shown in the picture. The pattern of the one-cent copper coin is exactly the same as the half-cent coin issued in the 25th year of the Republic of China. After the start of work, 300,000 copper coins and one million silver coins can be produced every day. After the silver coins and copper coins have a considerable output, nickel coins also need to be cast urgently. All the subsidiary coins used in the country will be produced here. The development of factory affairs is in full swing. The mint, which has been paralyzed for ten years, has been regenerated due to the currency reform.</p>

<h3>Social Affairs Bureau Rejects Increase in Rickshaw Fares</h3>
<p>Businessmen Plan to Apply to the Supervisory Office</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] Since the currency reform, the government has strictly controlled the prices of all items, using the prices of August 19th as the standard. According to inquiries from the Social Affairs Bureau, the price limits for rickshaw and pedicab fares are still based on the prices of July 31st, which were set according to the July price levels. The daily fare for a two-person pedicab is 1.15 million legal tender, for a single-person pedicab, 920,000 legal tender, and for a rickshaw, 570,000 legal tender. However, because the prices of goods before August 19th had already fluctuated, the rickshaw fares were not adjusted in time. In fact, there is now a black market for rickshaw fares, with daily fares for pedicabs around 3 million legal tender, more than double the previous amount. Recently, businessmen requested the Social Affairs Bureau to increase rickshaw fares, but the Social Affairs Bureau did not consider it. It is said that the businessmen still plan to apply to the Economic Control Supervisory Office.</p>

<h3>Clerks of the District Prosecutor's Office, Etc., Dismissed, Submit Appeals</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] Not long after the new Chief Prosecutor Zhang Yuquan took office at the District Court Prosecutor's Office, eight clerks, including Xu Qiwu, suddenly received orders from the Ministry of Judicial Administration on the 17th of last month, simultaneously dismissing them from their positions, without stating the reasons. Xu and the others believe that they have been dutiful and law-abiding since joining the office. Some of them have even been qualified and have received annual performance evaluations, promotions, or awards, all of which are documented. It is unexpected that they would be collectively dismissed without cause when the head of the office changed. They believe that this is an unprecedented event and may undermine the good system of the judicial community. Therefore, Xu and the others, based on the facts, have separately sent letters to the President's Office, the Legislative Yuan, the Control Yuan, the Ministry of Judicial Administration, and other relevant agencies and organizations, appealing the truth of the matter.</p>
<p>[Another Report] The Ministry of Judicial Administration recently issued a circular to courts in various locations, stating that judicial personnel have always had security of tenure and should not be easily transferred.

<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] In late last month, a young man named Zheng Jiafan visited Guan Xiang's home at No. 60 Siwen Lane, Changyang Road, through Zhao, a matchmaker. Guan happened to be unemployed, and Zhao introduced him to Zheng. Zheng showed a business card, and Guan saw that the card listed him as the station master of the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway's Hangzhou Station. Guan warmly welcomed him and immediately begged him to find him a job. Zheng readily agreed, but said that he needed an activity fee of 150 million legal tender. Guan handed over the full amount. Three days later, Zheng visited Guan again, falsely claiming that the matter had been arranged and that he could start work as soon as he received a letter. Guan was extremely excited and said that he also had an older brother, Guan Zheng, a sister-in-law, Guan Qingxia, and a younger sister, Guan Jingyi, and asked if Zheng could also find work for them. Zheng readily agreed and took another 200 million legal tender as an activity fee. Several days later, Guan went to the Hangzhou Railway Station in Hangzhou to inquire, only to learn that this person had been dismissed long ago. He quickly returned to Shanghai and inquired at the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway Office on North Sichuan Road, and was told that this person had also left his job long ago. He then realized that he had been swindled. He found Zhao and went to the Yulin Road Police Sub-bureau to file a complaint. After investigation by Section Chief Rong, it was found that Zhao was not involved. Zheng Jiafan was arrested yesterday and taken to the bureau for questioning, where he confessed to the fraud. The case will be transferred to the District Prosecutor's Office for further investigation.</p>

<h3>Jiading Headless Murder Case: Chen Shoutao and Others, Partners of Shanghai Fuda Wine Workshop, Indicted</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Jiading 9th Report] Regarding the case of the unidentified male corpse found in a wheat field in Gu Cai Wan, Chengqiao Township, on April 24th of this year, after multiple investigations by the County Police Bureau, the main criminals Chen Shoutao and Tang Yongquan were finally apprehended on the 16th of last month and transferred to the District Prosecutor's Office for investigation. An indictment was filed on the 8th. The details are as follows: Chen Shoutao, Tang Yongquan, and the deceased, Li Heyun, were originally apprentices at the Xinshengtai Wine Workshop in Tangqiao Town, Pudong. Later, Chen and Li left the Xinshengtai Wine Workshop in January of this year and jointly opened the Fuda Wine Workshop in Shanghai. Soon after, Tang Yongquan also joined the workshop as a partner. Before long, Tang and Li began to compete for personal gain, leading to resentment and hostility. On April 21st of this year, Chen Shoutao and Guang Yongquan secretly conspired in Pudong to lure Li Heyun to Jiading, intending to kill him after getting him drunk, so that they could take over the Fuda Wine Workshop as their own. The murder plot was decided. The next afternoon at 6:00 PM, Shoutao and Yongquan lured Heyun into taking a car to Jiading. At 7:00 PM that evening, they went to a small hotel in Dongmen to get him drunk. At around 8:00 PM, they took him out of the hotel and dragged him to a wheat field near the Tang residence in Gu Cai Wan, Chengqiao Township. Shoutao knocked Heyun down, and Yongquan rode on Heyun's body, tightly gripping his throat, preventing him from making any noise. Shoutao rode on Heyun's lower body, holding a sharp blade, and stabbed him violently in the abdomen and waist. Yongquan also swung a knife, adding to the injuries. Heyun was killed on the spot. The next day, Chen and Tang returned to Pudong. Two days later, the deceased's mother, Li Xu, came to the shop to look for her son. Shoutao falsely told Li that Heyun had gone to Nanjing. The next day, Yongquan and Shoutao forged a letter from the deceased to his mother, stating that Heyun was now working as a clerk in the Nanjing Garrison Command and advised his mother to return home quickly and not to visit him in Nanjing, adding that he could hand over his shares of the shop, etc. Shoutao then instructed Yongquan to post the letter in Nanjing. After receiving the letter, Li settled the accounts with Shoutao, and Shoutao took over the Fuda Wine Workshop. Yongquan returned to the city and became the food affairs officer at Hengmao Construction Company. After receiving a tip-off, the County Police Bureau arrested Chen Shoutao and Tang Yongquan one after another, and the headless murder case was finally solved.</p>
<h3>Wuxing Salt Sold at Limited Prices: Wuxi Smuggling Materials Out of the Area</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Wuxing 9th Report] Since the government controlled prices, salt merchants here have cited reasons such as difficult sourcing or increased salt taxes, and shops selling table salt limit purchases to half a catty per person, or even refuse to sell in smaller quantities.

A total of 14,267 dan were found, which is sufficient to supply until the end of the year. However, the salt merchants wanted to raise the salt price to 1.5 jiao per catty (the original price was 5 fen per catty). The Special Commissioner firmly refused to allow this and strictly ordered the salt to be sold at limited prices, with severe penalties for violators. However, the salt merchants are still unwilling to supply it in large quantities.</p>

<h3>A Poor Couple in Guizhou Reenacts "Returning to the Kiln"</h3>
<p>— By Our Reporter Liu Mengchi</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Guiyang 7th Dispatch] At around 5:00 PM yesterday (the 6th) in the Riverside Park here, a scene from the play "Returning to the Kiln" was reenacted, played by a middle-aged woman in tattered clothes and a homeless man who had just returned to Guizhou from Chongqing. A crowd gathered to watch, and the news spread far and wide. Among the small figures in this great era, they are not the only couple to have encountered such a situation. However, their reunion, which was both bizarre and ultimately sad, is a serious social problem.</p>
<p>A Wandering Person Li Anguo</p>
<p>The homeless man, Li Anguo, is from Qianxi and is nearly forty years old this year. During the second year of the War of Resistance Against Japan in August, he enlisted in the army in his hometown and fought in Hubei, before moving to Xuzhou. In the suburbs of Xuzhou, he was honorably wounded while defending the country and fell on the battlefield. When the troops withdrew, he was unable to catch up and remained in the enemy's rear as a prisoner of war, imprisoned in Nanjing. Later, he was forced to serve the enemy army in transporting food, which was in July of the thirty-second year. On the evening of August 27th of the same year, he and several others who shared the same fate escaped from the devil's clutches and wandered to Shanghai. Every day, he collected discarded items in the Jiangwan area and sold them to make a living. He also worked odd jobs at the Nanguo Dance Hall, hoping to wait for the day to dawn.</p>
<p>Deported Back to Guiyang</p>
<p>Sure enough, the War of Resistance was won! In principle, he should have had a better life, but unfortunately, things did not go smoothly. A guest's coat was lost in the dance hall, and everyone said he did it during the investigation. The police station ruled to deport him, and from then on, he embarked on the path of the . . . unable to stay in Shanghai any longer. At this time, his only hope was to flee back to his hometown and resume his life as a tenant farmer.</p>
<p>From Shanghai, he traveled to Hankou mixed in with passengers on a ship. Relying on his strength, he worked as a porter at the dock for a while, which allowed him to come into contact with boatmen traveling up the Yangtze River, and he also learned how to row a boat. So, he helped a boat owner surnamed Lu row a boat, and he wandered to Chongqing in this way. At this time, he had saved some money. Starting on August 5th, he set off from Chongqing and walked to Guiyang, also working as a porter along the way.</p>
<p>A Park Meeting Between Husband and Wife</p>
<p>Returning to his hometown of Guizhou brought him much joy, but the high cost of living quickly consumed his savings. His long-dreamed-of hometown offered him no place to stand. In recent days, he has been plagued by illness, and even affordable medicine is beyond reach. He told people that he really didn't want to live any longer, and dying in his hometown would be enough to fulfill his wish. As if by someone's decree, his wife, Zhang Jingfang, from whom he had been separated for more than a decade, was sending a letter to the management office of the Riverside Park for her employer yesterday afternoon, and they unexpectedly "reunited after a long separation." The joy of the first half of the reunion can be imagined.</p>
<p>Embracing and Crying Together</p>
<p>According to Zhang Jingfang, her wandering husband told the onlookers: Since her husband left, she had not received any news. "Many people said you were already dead and advised me to remarry, but I never believed it. Today, you have finally returned!" She was so happy that she almost went crazy, forgetting that she should be with the onlookers. "I couldn't stay in my hometown of Qianxi and listen to people's ridicule, so I came to Guiyang to help people in the thirty-fourth year. Now I work at Li Gongguan in Taicibiao, and I can barely make a living."</p>
<p>They reunited on this difficult journey of life, overjoyed, embracing and crying together, comforting each other. Crying is not a solution, so they slowly walked on the willow-lined embankment of the Riverside Park, planning their future life. Zhang Jingfang has a job and is happier to have her husband back than any treasure. But her husband "has nothing," and his expression is far from the one he had when they first reunited. When the reporter asked them what they would do in the future, Li Anguo asked me instead: "Sir, are you hiring laborers?" This truly embarrassed me, and I could only respond with a bitter smile.</p>

Recently, he was driven out, and the son-in-law joined the Self-Defense Team, harboring resentment against his father-in-law and repeatedly seeking revenge. He gathered three others and went to Zhou Taixing's house with knives, forcing him to open the door and attacking him, inflicting more than ten cuts. They searched the house and fled.</p>

<h3>Foreign Exchange Transfer of Brokerages Completed; Centralized Organization Followed by Submission to the Ministry of Finance for Review; Foreign Exchange Assets of Factories and Companies to be Handled Separately; Generally, the Deadline Will be the 18th of This Month</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper News] The foreign exchange transfer declaration and registration of brokerages, insurance, and trust industries in this city was largely completed smoothly by yesterday afternoon. More than 350 units reported. All data was collected and organized in the afternoon by Deputy Director Wu Bin of the Business Bureau. Director Lin Letang is scheduled to take everything to Beijing last night for review by the ministry. However, if the organization takes too much time, Lin may postpone his trip to Beijing by train until this morning. According to people in charge, among commercial banks, the four with the most foreign exchange are the Shanghai Bank, Zhejiang Industrial, Jin City, and United. Zhejiang Xingye has already sold quite a bit. Among money shops, Fuyuanju is the leading one. The foreign exchange figures for all insurance companies are not very high. When counting the foreign exchange assets of brokerages, it can be found that some of the foreign exchange they bought in the past has become privately owned due to dividends for shareholders and employees. The amount owned by legal entities is not as much as expected. This situation is especially common in small-scale brokerages. As for the amount of foreign exchange transferred, it is difficult to estimate at this time because there are many types of assets, including various foreign currencies and foreign stocks, making conversion difficult. At the same time, the future review work in Nanjing will be carefully researched to determine whether the figures reported by the brokerages are accurate and reliable, and then officially announced. The transfer of foreign exchange assets of factories and companies will be handled separately, generally requiring them to be transferred to the four banks of China, Communications, Agriculture, and Central by the 18th of this month. How this foreign exchange position will be used in the future will also be determined by the Ministry of Finance with specific measures, no different from commercial banks, money shops, trust, and insurance companies. The detailed methods for registration and transfer are also being negotiated by the Central Bank and the entrusted banks.</p>
<h3>Sluggish Outflow, Sparse Transactions, Rice Market Depressed, Prices of Flour, Grains, Oilcakes Uniformly Declining</h3>
<p>The rice market is weak and listless. Although the North Market barely held its original price from the previous day, the South Market continued to see reductions. Due to sluggish outflows and few replenishments by rice shops, the market atmosphere is depressed and transactions are sparse. Bo rice decreased by 2 jiao, white geng rice decreased by 1 jiao, and xian rice decreased by 2-3 jiao due to the increasing amount of new xian rice on the market. Only white yuan rice has consistently held its original price due to its scarcity. Transactions in the North Market are also few, the market is very weak, and prices remain unchanged. Yesterday's arrivals were 2,685 shi in the South Market and 1,755 shi in the North Market.</p>
<p>Flour</p>
<p>Weak and soft, actual sales sluggish, transactions quiet. Although factories have no supply, the inventory in the market is still sufficient due to low sales. Therefore, supply is not lacking. Initial opening prices were able to hold their original levels, but closing prices saw a slight decline. Old army flour was 7 yuan 5 jiao 1 fen, down 2 fen. Navy ship flour was down 3 fen. Mixed-brand flour saw little fluctuation and generally held its original level. Bran was 5 yuan 3 jiao, slightly weaker by 1 fen. The factory price for wheat remained at 10 yuan 0 jiao 3 fen.</p>
<p>Grains</p>
<p>Flat and weak. Due to sluggish sales, supply exceeds demand. Wholesale sales of soybeans have stopped. The price of oil has fallen, and factory demand is weak. The market shows a weak trend. Broad beans were opened according to limits. Many new arrivals of red sorghum were met with few sales, and the price decreased by 2 jiao. Green beans saw few transactions. New Xuzhou green beans were 17 yuan 1 jiao. Corn transactions were active, with Yantai merchants buying, and the price was also set. More than a hundred packages of sesame were opened. Sales of raw peanuts were sluggish, and the market remained weak.</p>
<p>Cooking Oil</p>
<p>Falling. Due to the implementation of the export ban, inland sales have stopped. Those holding goods are eager to sell, and the market is falling. Both bean oil factories opened, priced at 48 yuan 5 jiao. The later market rebounded to 48 yuan 2 jiao, a drop of 1 yuan. Cooked vegetable oil fell by as much as 2 yuan. Old-barrel cooked vegetable oil traded at 40 yuan. Raw vegetable oil was down 1 yuan. Only raw oil and small-cart sesame oil maintained their old prices and traded within limits due to few arrivals and scarce inventory. Soybean cake from the Changli Zi Peng factory opened with 5-6 thousand pieces, priced at 4 yuan 6 jiao, with payments due next Monday. Some wholesale sales occurred. Other returned goods from Sheng Ren Ji were generally down 1 jiao 5 fen, to 4 yuan 3 jiao.</p>
<h3>Foreign Tea Firms Show Steady Improvement</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper News] According to tea magnate She Jie'an, after our government announced currency system reforms and revised foreign exchange rates on the 20th of last month, exporters in this city reported the situation abroad. At that time, in addition to some colleagues who received replies immediately, the rest have also recently received telegrams, reporting eager need for tea and instructing shipments to be made without reservation. Therefore, the foreign trade of Chinese tea is becoming brighter. Unfortunately, local inventories are very low and are affected by rising production prices, resulting in few transactions and steadily improving prices. In summary, the foreign tea market is showing small improvements. As for domestic tea sales, imports and exports remain the same, and the market atmosphere remains as before.</p>
<h3>Market Remains Calm as Usual; Credit Still Loose</h3>
<p>The market for goods remained calm as usual yesterday, and the volume of transactions was also significantly reduced. It is reported that off-market deals of some popular goods are still rumored from time to time. The oversupply of funds has not tightened. Underground interest rates are between 1 jiao 2 fen and 1 jiao 5 fen. It is very difficult to get large amounts of money released. It often requires reserving the amount the day before to find a use for it. Due to difficulties in shipping for customers, industrial and commercial sales are sluggish, and speculative activities have disappeared. "Kicking the ball" and "scalping" activities have been swept away. Citizens also perceive that prices are stable, reversing the previous buying panic. Therefore, business is slow in all industries, and bankruptcies often occur in the business community. Those who hold orders have to demand collateral for the money they lend, as a guarantee. There were no fluctuations in any of the markets yesterday.</p>
<p>Although the Central Bank had a surplus of 450,000 yuan in the exchange of notes among the Pihang Second Bureau and the Treasury, the result was still a deficit of 1.56 million yuan because the remaining banks and bureaus had a unanimous deficit.

If bank bureaus in various regions do not comply with this regulation when accepting remittances, the Central Bank may cancel their eligibility to request fund transfers and will not handle the transfers for them.</p>

<h3>Worldwide Basketball Fever: U.S. Olympic Basketball Team Leader Discusses Impressions of London Games</h3>
<p>[United Press International, New York, 9th] According to the leader of the U.S. Olympic basketball team, upon his triumphant return to America from England, "The whole world is in a state of basketball frenzy." Olympic Basketball Committee Chairman Wilkie stated, "The maturation of international basketball competition is not far off. Basketball is flourishing in Europe, and is also gaining momentum in South America. They have surpassed our ideals, displaying 100% excellent basketball skills." Wilkie and U.S. Olympic basketball team coach, Brownell, both expressed astonishment at the progress of basketball in various countries since 1936 but do not feel that the United States is in danger of losing the championship in the next or subsequent Olympic Games. Wilkie said, "We almost suffered our first defeat in history in London. We fought hard to beat Argentina 59-57." Brownell commented, "If we had used older methods, this wouldn't have happened. The Argentine team's offense was fierce, but their defense was full of loopholes. They even still use zone defense, or even older methods." Although some spectators were dissatisfied with the height of the American players, especially the seven-foot center, Klent, most welcomed the American team. The International Basketball Association discussed limiting the height of basketball players in the next Olympic Games, but the vote was 17 to 27, rejecting the restriction on tall players. After consideration, it was felt that Klent was a good basketball player and a gentle giant. Klent said, "We could have taken advantage of our height, but we decided not to. According to the 1936 rules, I could have stood under the opponent's basket as a rim protector, hitting the ball out of the basket. But we never did that even once." South America and France are particularly interested in basketball competitions, singing national anthems before each game to boost morale. They are quick in movement and accurate in shooting, especially formidable in the free-throw area. However, their methods are relatively outdated; the United States' progress in the past decade has left them far behind. Given the current popularity, basketball will not only be permanently included in the Olympic program but will also become as important as track and field and swimming.</p>

<h3>The Bottom Line</h3>
<p>— Bai Shui</p>
<p>Until recently, I recently had the opportunity to read the wonderful poems of the American Dorothy Parker, still from the translation quoted by Mr. Zhu Ziqing (see "On the Appreciation of Elegance and Popularity," page 57). Zhu called it "common sense poetry," which is what the old British novelist and playwright W. Somerset Maugham called it in the introduction. There are originally two kinds of poems, one is an unrestrained reverie, saying whatever you want, Li Bai's type is also this, that is also a kind of "truth," but it is emotional; one is to tell the truth, to say clearly what others are unwilling to say, even stabbing a hole to fish out the truth, scolding in the street is also okay, it is even more outstandingly clever if you see through what others cannot, Tao Yuanming is this type, Du Fu is also this type, but the gentlemen who make epigrammatic poems and mottoes cannot be counted, that pedantic sourness is the pretense of a hypocrite and cannot be called the truth of poetry. Mrs. Parker has a poem called "The Bottom Line," which I think is quite good:</p>
<p>Razors teach you to hurt your face</p>
<p>Rivers wet your clothes and feet</p>
<p>Acids leave you scars</p>
<p>Drugs cause cramps and dilate veins</p>
<p>Bullets don't understand rules</p>
<p>Traps are open waiting for people</p>
<p>Gas is acrid and makes you want to vomit</p>
<p>Yet you still survive</p>
<p>Isn't that the truth? Although our Chinese poets also lament the hardships of life, such as "Like morning dew, the days gone by are full of suffering," these sentences are good enough, but I feel they are not strong enough in comparison! In other words, it is not concrete, there is no imagery, so it is not easy to be appreciated by everyone, the majority. From this point of view, the so-called common sense in poetry is very different from the ordinary. Teachers teach us, or books tell us, that we must not say that we will not shave because the razor hurts our face, nor can we stop taking medicine because the medicine causes cramps and dilated veins. Ordinary common sense calls this "Do not stop eating because of choking," which is not wrong, if you don't eat, you will starve to death! However, there are also those in society who have expanded "Do not stop eating because of choking" into a stain on humanity, such as war, which is originally an enlargement of the "Do not stop eating because of choking" theory. I once wrote a small article called Political Morality, saying that conquest is to force others to admit that it is reasonable with power, that murderers die, is choking, and killing to benefit the world is not stopping eating, but you say, in the end, did it benefit the world? This still needs to be investigated. According to the naive thinking of poets, it is best for everyone to put down their knives and shake hands. The beard on the face is also life, what does it matter whether you shave it or not, why make your flesh tremble in fear! Artists have long hair, there is a reason! But you can't always think of things in the world in a naive way, because you are naive, but others are not. Mr. Zhu Ziqing said in "On Telling the Truth" that the reason for not telling the truth is to guard against each other, fearing that they will be taken advantage of; that's right, people are the most useless thing, saying good things in their mouths, and tripping others under their feet, no animal is so shameless, but that is why people are people. Mencius said that what distinguishes humans from animals is subtle, common people abandon it, gentlemen preserve it, I have long said that this is nonsense, precisely because gentlemen preserve it, gentlemen are the worst. Humans use animals to scold people, if I were an animal, I would definitely use "human" to scold animals. For example, a dog can scold a dog of the same kind as "You unfaithful and unjust person!" A worker bee can scold a drone bee as "You idle person!" Ants and aphids can scold even more; "You who do not know how to love, help, and understand each other!" Why do humans scold animals? Even though they deceive them, eat their meat, sell their skin, they still scold them, how heartless! In general, the characteristic of mankind is that they can make their own traps and then drill into them themselves, dying and dying, still people die the most and the most tragically, which can also be regarded as karmic retribution! This is the common sense of poets, the bottom line calculated by poets, if cotton yarn tycoons, stock market giants, and the like heard it, they would definitely say that you are crazy and have no common sense. Strange! The most ignorant people in the world are the most knowledgeable, and they are excellent people, how can the world not be in great chaos?</p>
<p>This bottom line is really hard to calculate!</p>
<h3>The Noble Thief</h3>
<p>— Sun Rong</p>
<p>In the world's top hotels, there are often "sticky-fingered" guests who take away silver-plated cutlery and towels, supposedly as souvenirs. On the British luxury liner Queen Elizabeth, thousands of pieces of tableware are lost every trip.</p>
<p>However, those "sticky-fingered" people are most interested in the White House, the U.S. President's residence. Knives and forks engraved with "White House" are ideal souvenirs, aren't they? As a result, every time the President hosts a banquet, many knives and forks disappear. The larger the banquet, the more knives and forks are lost.</p>
<p>It is said that Mrs. Roosevelt once bought a large number of knives and forks from American "dime stores" specifically for guests to steal as souvenirs.</p>
<h3>Recent Works by Xia An</h3>
<p>— Ye Gongchuo</p>
<p>Lord Liang Yonghuai, in charge of the Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway project, has made great contributions for forty years. I wrote a poem to praise him:</p>
<p>Why not be a pioneer in opening roads, for forty years, many scenes have followed. Talented scholars compete for power, but the old master is the real dragon. The ingenuity of the wheel follows the people's wishes, and the combination of tracks can follow the wisdom of the master craftsman. Fortunately, praise is now heard on the road, and the peaches and plums planted have formed a dense green shade.</p>
<p>Also, two poems imitating palace lamentations</p>
<p>Serving in Zhaoyang for forty autumns, the new makeup is prepared without a plan; waiting to tell the story of the creation of the world, who knows that one's head gradually turns white when looking in the mirror!</p>
<p>Years of storing bitterness and stopping pain, old dreams only pity the blue royal body; don't be surprised by the frequent mistakes at the banquet, there are many who have been there in the song.</p>
<h3>Foot Pain</h3>
<p>— Lin Lin</p>
<p>According to some historians: Thirty years ago, one person's foot pain resulted in the second world war.</p>
<p>That person with foot pain was then the president of the United States, Wilson. President Wilson had a terrible temper, often flew into a rage for no reason, making everyone around him resent him, and most members of Congress had been inexplicably insulted by him, so everyone wanted revenge. When Wilson proposed the League of Nations bill after the war, Congress saw it as a great opportunity and vetoed it without hesitation, so the United States did not join the League of Nations. If the United States could have joined the League of Nations and played a leading role in the League of Nations, then the League of Nations could have been greatly strengthened, and the Second World War might have been avoided.</p>
<p>But why was Wilson's temper so irritable? - It was because of his feet. He had this disease all his life, and when it hurt, it was like being cut with a knife. Wilson was a very meticulous person, usually with a bit of arrogance, so even though his feet were painful, he never complained to others, but just gritted his teeth and endured it. Coupled with his busy schedule, it was naturally easy to get angry.</p>
<p>There have also been other presidents in American history who often had foot pain. Lincoln said: "When my feet hurt, I don't feel like doing anything, I can't even think quietly.</p>
<p>According to estimates by the American Podiatric Medical Association, 70% of the American population has foot pain, totaling 100 million people. There are 53 types of foot pain, from corns to terrible cancer. The most common are calluses, moisture, ingrown toenails, and deformed toes.</p>
<p>The U.S. Department of Education has conducted foot examinations for students in various schools, and the results show that the vast majority of students wear shoes that are too small, affecting the health of their feet.</p>
<p>In addition, doctors say that it is harmless to the health of the feet for ladies and gentlemen to wear high heels occasionally in social situations; however, if they wear high heels to work, do housework, or go shopping - then by nightfall, they will be exhausted and have a terrible temper, and will quarrel over trivial matters.</p>
<p>The following is the advice of doctors to everyone, if you can faithfully implement it, foot pain can be reduced:</p>
<p>(1) After trying on new shoes, you must stand up and walk a few steps before buying them. Do not just sit down and try them on before buying them.</p>
<p>(2) Our left and right feet often have different sizes, so when buying shoes, you should use the size of the larger foot.</p>
<p>(3) Do not wear shoes barefoot, you should wear socks. The height of the socks must be at least one inch above the ankle.</p>
<p>(4) When doing housework, sit down as much as possible.</p>
<p>(5) Do not keep shoes to use as slippers. Old shoes that have lost their shape will only harm your feet and will not give you a sense of comfort.</p>
<p>(6) It is best not to wear the same pair of shoes every day. You should buy several pairs and wear them in rotation, which is not only comfortable, but also makes the shoes less likely to be damaged.</p>
<p>(7) When buying shoes for children, you must take them to try them on. Do not just bring an old shoe to buy new ones.</p>
<p>(8) Do not be penny-wise and pound-foolish, and use shoes that your older brother has worn for your younger brother. This concerns the lifelong happiness of your child, so do not lose sight of the big picture.</p>
<h3>Australian Animals</h3>
<p>— Mao Yi</p>
<p>Australia has an area comparable to that of the United States, but its population is only 7.5 million.</p>
<p>This is the country of sheep, but pastures are extremely scarce, requiring 20 acres of land to raise one sheep. An average small ranch with 5,000 sheep occupies 20 miles in length and 10 miles in width. A large ranch occupies an area of 10,000 square miles. A large ranch can shear the wool of one million sheep in a "bumper" year.</p>
<p>In the last century, Australians imported a few rabbits, hoping that they would multiply and provide food. However, they multiplied so much that they numbered in the hundreds of millions and competed with humans for food. So, in order to prevent their expansion, Australians began to build a fence 1,139 miles long and four feet high. However, before the fence was completed, there were rabbits inside and outside the fence. Now, the Australian government is planning to import a disease that can kill rabbits without harming other animals.</p>
<h3>The Skin of the Stomach and Meat</h3>
<p>Korea has one person who was first loyal and then disloyal, named Li Wanyong; and another person who was first not very loyal, and later became loyal, named Park Younghyo. The ancient saying goes, "The coffin lid closes, then the evaluation is final," and you cannot judge until the end. Li Wanyong, in the capacity of Prime Minister of the Korean Cabinet, signed an agreement with Ito Hirobumi to be guided by the Resident-General (Korean Emperor Gwangmu 11th year, Japanese Meiji 40th year), and an agreement with Terauchi Masatake to merge (Korean Emperor Longhee 4th year, Japanese Meiji 43rd year): and the Korean Emperor became the King Lee in Japan. Therefore, not only Korean patriots pointed and hated him, but people from all countries also despised the name of Li Wanyong. However, between the Sino-Japanese and Russo-Japanese wars, Li Wanyong was actually a strong anti-Japanese figure. When Empress Myeongseong was assassinated, Li was escorted to the Russian embassy, issued orders, punished pro-Japanese ministers, and persuaded Russia to use its military force to help Korea suppress Japan. For a year, the Japanese feared and loved him, and made all kinds of connections. Until after the Russo-Japanese War, when Japanese power had spread throughout Korea, he colluded with Ito and served his commands. The change of heart from beginning to end was probably due to the environment? Park Younghyo, on the other hand, supported the Japanese side twenty years ago, reformed Korean politics, offended the Korean Emperor, took refuge in Japan, and was pointed out by the Japanese as a pro-Japanese party, and Ito also approved of him. When he was appointed Resident-General, he recommended him to the Korean court, intending to give him a prominent position, but Park deeply recognized his ambitions and strongly declined. Later, after the Hague incident, the Japanese forced the Korean Emperor to abdicate, Park suddenly went to the palace to ask to be Minister of the Palace, kept the seal, and insisted on not handing it over. Subsequently, the Korean people resisted in unison, and the Japanese said that this was instigated by Younghyo, so they arrested and imprisoned him. The above two sections are from Liang Cangjiang's "A Special Record of Japan's Annexation of Korea".</p>
<h3>Continued Excerpts from Yun Jian's Jottings on Orchids (Middle)</h3>
<p>— Bai Jiao</p>
<p>Taiwanese Orchid: With fine wine and pure delicacies, obtaining an exquisite orchid is worrisome; could it be that Ye Jia Lang from Dongting Lake is pointing at Yun Jian's new acquisition of a recently found species from Luoshan? Liangxi Zishan is about to leave; he should inform the elegant gentlemen of Jianye. It is unlikely to be available for purchase.</p>
<p>Exposed Root Orchid Three-Panel Screen</p>
<p>Does spiritual fragrance emerging from the mountains bring fortune or misfortune? However, Fu Weng comes temporarily for pure joy. Fortune arriving brings no delight, misfortune brings no alarm. The road may be rugged, but the heart remains at peace!</p>
<p>Taiyuan Lotus</p>
<p>Every time, I seek a rosy face, aided by a good sleep. For three years, this habit has not changed. Rumors have spread outside, saying that Yun Jian is very confused, either drunk or dreaming. This three-foot-long beauty is filled with the pure air of mountains and rivers. Who knows that Fu Weng, even in his drunken dreams, has obtained a treasure!</p>
<p>Jade Butterfly</p>
<p>Woke up on the morning of July 7th, the 37th year of the New Era, feeling mentally exhausted, wondering what ambitions exist in the world, and obtained this one piece.</p>
<p>Wind Orchid</p>
<p>The rain on the river is nourishing, and the wind at the eaves is gradually tightening. I closed the windows and ordered the servant boy to pull paper, planting orchids in the mountains. Unexpectedly, the wind's force reached the tip of the brush. Ah Yun, wanting to save effort, feared that it would be blown away and released his hand in realization!</p>
<p>Also</p>
<p>White clouds are in the sky, connected silently. Residing in solitude is admirable, and cannot be shaken or taken away!</p>
<p>Shen Ding</p>
<p>Ming Yizi is generous but unhappy, yet he enjoys searching for what is sweet. He will embark on a long journey, taking a plain white orchid as a token of eternal remembrance, carrying it north and telling people, "The South is desolate, only this gentlemanly flower remains!" This man praises me for understanding the essence, which is truly lovely.</p>
<p>Mountain Orchid</p>
<p>The clouds are wet and the air is steaming, indicating rain. I took off my clothes and sat casually, suddenly realizing that the mountains are high and the water is far, causing me great mental strain!</p>
<p>Twin-Stemmed Orchid</p>
<p>After drinking heavily of clam powder wine, the twin-headed flowers began to bloom. Cai Erlang saw it and laughed, saying, "Like this man, drinking my wine!" I recorded it as a source of future longing.</p>
<p>Heavenly Chapter Plum</p>
<p>A scholar observed Yun Jian's orchids and asked how to apply ink. I replied with a smile, "You must understand it yourself." He asked again, and I said, "Kumarajiva and Hui Jian said, 'Chewing food for others not only loses the flavor but also causes vomiting!'" You are not inheriting something blindly. I happened to remember this.</p>
<p>Thorny Orchid</p>
<p>Orchids are my old love, and thorns are my new acquaintance. My late father gave me a couplet: "With no remaining matters in the heart, all people before the eyes are good." This is precisely the state I am in at this moment.</p>
<p>Thorny Orchid Bamboo</p>
<p>Mr. Banqiao painted orchids and thorns together, once comparing thorns to loyal and capable officials defending the city. Yun Jian said, "This is what Emperor Guangwu knew, but what Zhu Yuanzhang found difficult! How are the officials in the remonstrance office different initially? Stinging the ears of the ruler puts them in danger, and the plan is to eliminate them, which leads to rapid demise. Why bother with a group of foolish rebels rising up with poles!"</p>
