<h3>全經會討論價主採嚴厲措施抑平漲風　推陳啟天等草具體建議</h3>
<p>〔本報南京十一日電〕全經會十一日舉行第卅六次例會，王雲五主席，首由副秘長顧毓瑔報吿，就一月份起至現在之物價上漲情形分析甚詳，顧謂：一月份物價尙稱平穩，自二月份第二週開始上漲，至第四週益趨猛烈，以米及棉紗為領導，其上漲程序巳失正常狀態。三月三日起漲風益厲，現仍在續漲中。顧氏報吿畢，各委員即對物價問題廣泛交換意見，熱烈討論，咸認邇來物價暴漲原因固多，如和謠及東北游資大量南流，均足以刺激物價，但非法奸商之投機操縱，亦為最大原因之一，多主應採取嚴萬措施，以抑平漲風。常推定陳啓天，何浩若，劉振東，黃元彬，鄧飛黃，　秉文等硏究辦法，提出具體建議，於下次會中討論。嗣即討論甲，農部所擬之桐油，蠶絲，羊毛，茶葉等四項外銷物資增產計劃，決議照審査意見通過。原計劃以三年為目標，（一）桐油，第一年增產至六萬噸，第二年增至八萬噸，第三年增至十萬噸。（二）蠶絲，預計三年內製造生絲六萬五千担，外銷綢緞八百萬碼。（三）茶葉，在三年內擬生產一百廿萬担。（四）羊毛，希望年產粗毛二億二千萬磅，細毛四億八千萬磅。審査意見為（一）設新機構問題由政院決定。（二）所需經費應與農貸配合。（三）設立工廠應與經部協商辦理。（四）農產品品質應嚴格考臉。乙，輸管會呈全經會為中信局代理政府收購桐油，猪鬃外銷物資再就外銷結匯繳庫國幣收取百分之一手續費案，經討論結果，予以否決，其理由為：（一）過去規定祗有代辦手續費，並無代銷與收購手續費之分。（二）所有外銷一切費用，均實報實銷，代辦手續費，照過去規定，僅桐油，猪鬃兩項，即十八億元，如增加收購手續費，將增至六十億元。（三）除桐油，猪鬃外，尙有其他外銷物資，如均要求外銷手續費，將增國庫開支。</p>

<h3>馬歇爾向讀者宣布美對華政策不變　五億物資六月可全運華</h3>
<p>〔美國新聞處華盛頓十日電〕馬歇爾國務卿十日在答覆詢問時宣稱：美國對華政策，仍為企求該國能有一更廣大基礎之政府。馬卿謂，杜魯門總統曾於一九四五年十二月十八日言明此點。根據此項聲明，所有黨派應共謀解決其異見。自該時期以還，美方未再發表對華政策。但馬卿復補充稱：共黨目前旣已公開向政府叛變，美國未便指定條件，應由中國政府予以處理。馬卿今日論及對華政策，係因某一記者提出詢問之故。據該記者稱，議員富爾頓曾謂美國從未否認其原有之對華政策，此即為促成中國國共聯合政府。馬卿稱，一九四五年九月曾有局部之協　，但從未執行。</p>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓十一日電〕馬歇爾在記者招待會宣稱，美國應付歐洲與遠東共產黨挑　採取兩種不同之方法，但其一部份相同之點，則為無論在在中國或歐洲，美國均係積極援助與共產黨作戰之政府。</p>

<p>〔美國新聞處華盛頓十日電〕食米及小麥約一萬六千二百長噸，將於三月底前在美國西海岸及南部港口裝運赴華，刻已在四艘輪船上預定貨艙。此外，並在「爪哇」號郵船上預定貨艙，以便將穀類種子約五百長噸運赴中國。該輪預定於三月廿六日在西雅圖裝貨，此項援助係由援華使團辦理。</p>

<h3>從捷克外長自殺說起</h3>
<p>自捷克政變樹立共產政權後，未滿半月，捷克開國元勛哲嗣馬薩里克外長，竟躍樓自殺身死。惡耗傳出，舉世震驚，無不悼惜馬薩里克之為自由民主而死。走着中間偏左的路綫的自由主義者，竟遭此悲壯的下塲，不特為捷克的一大悲劇，而且也是世界和平民主前途的一大打擊！</p>
<p>其實，我們在捷克共產政權組成之後，早就指出捷克新政府不過是一個披有偽裝的一黨專政的獨裁制，同時並料到捷克的悲劇，勢必層出不窮。這十幾天來的事實，證明我們見解的正確。初有貝奈斯總統被迫辭職的傳說，後又有捷共在國內實行『整肅』的舉動，雷厲風行，使一般人民吸不到一口自由空氣。這次馬薩里克的自殺，以身殉捷克的自由民主，不僅將捷共攫取政權的偽裝揭破無遺，而且使我們更加相信共產主義與民主政治，實為兩種絕對不能共存的觀念。共產勢力在東歐的發展，以及中共匪軍在我國內的猖獗，已使世人所愛好的自由和民主，感受到非常嚴重的威脅。所以，馬歇爾國務卿也稱捷克政變為『恐怖時代』，並警吿世人，謂世界大局已臻於嚴重階段了。</p>
<p>當然，我們也相信美國當局對於共產勢力的威脅世界和平與民主，早已提高警覺。杜魯門主義的倡導，以及馬歇爾計劃的進行，卽足以說明美國行政當局早巳在那裏打算防患於未然的大計了。所可扼腕的，乃是主張的不澈底，行動的不迅速！以杜魯門主義而論，在歐洲固尙未貫澈，而在亞洲則猶無踪影。再言馬歇爾計劃，迄今尙在國會辯論的階段，總數幾何，何時實行，均在未知之數。但是我們放眼看看目前的歐洲，世界的分裂日益明朗，倫敦會議雖已決定西德三國佔領區實行合併，英，法，荷，比，盧五國代表，雖已將西歐五國聯盟公約起草完成，但是這些外交活動，不論從　政治的，經濟的，軍事的，或外交的觀點而論，　不及紅色鐵幕以內的驚人發展。二月五日有蘇羅互助條約的簽字，接着二月十八日又有蘇匈互助條約的簽訂；捷克經過這次政變之後，由捷共掌握政權，也就完全投入蘇聯懷裏去了。捷克是歐洲的心臟『誰能控制捷克，誰就能控制歐陸』。最近蘇聯又迫令芬蘭與其締結軍事同盟條約，現在雖然還在談判的階段，但是芬蘭處此境遇，呼援無門，除了接受蘇聯的要求而外，恐怕也沒有第二條道路可走！</p>
<p>但所謂西歐聯盟，並不是一種新頴的理想，而是一種陳舊的老調。在第二次大戰結束之初，世人都憧憬着『天下一家』的美麗遠景，邱吉爾在美國富爾登發表演說，鼓吹歐洲合衆國的理論，當時輿論界無不認為邱氏提倡這種陳舊的主張，似乎太落後跟不上時代了，就是在美國外交當局也抱着這種貌似『前進』的見解。但至今天回想起來，却又不能不佩服邱氏的遠見了。現在西歐聯盟雖已成為事實，但經兩年的蹉跎歲月，其意義及作用也　喪失過半了。以領導世界民主勢力自命的美國當局，應該反躬自省。速謀補救之道！</p>
<p>我們從歐洲再回到亞洲，觀察美國的現行政策，不論是對於日本，對於朝鮮，或是對於中國，均已鑄成歷史上極大的謬誤。允其是馬歇爾國務卿對於中國政治的看法，不僅是一大錯誤，而且也是一大失敗！馬帥來華調處國共談判，他始終認為中共是一個普通的政黨，堅決主張我國政府擴大基礎須將中共包括在內。後來談判失敗，馬帥怏快不樂，悄然離華返國。現在看了捷克的政變，再回想起過去談判的經過，我們大可勸吿馬帥，不必再有所不快了。因為馬帥那時主張的「聯合政府」卽使成功，但誰能保證中共不採取類似捷共的手段，也來一個驚人的「政變」，樹立起覇佔中國的極權的共產政府呢？果爾，則馬帥不僅對不起中國，也對不起美國，對不起全世界愛好民主自由的人們，而旦要引為終身抱憾了。可是據合衆社的報道，馬帥並未因捷克政變而有所覺悟，至今仍主張擴大中國政府某礎，使我們眞不明白馬帥的卓見何在。我們今天雖不願說，馬帥來華調處實巳給予中共擴張勢力的機會，但是我們不能不指出，美國援華的不够積極，尤其是美國國務院職業外交家的偏袒中共，實為中共勢力擴大的因素之一。</p>
<p>現在共產勢力在莫斯科的指揮導演之下，侵入歐亞兩洲，美國若不同時結合所有民主國家予以阻攔，則其為患之烈，恐不堪設想。美國或者還有一部分人士認為歐洲局勢的危念甚過於亞洲，故仍主張先歐後亞，其實這也是只知其一不知其二的見解。須知美國若不能在亞洲阻攔共產勢力的擴張，則不問其在歐洲如何「全力」援助，終難扭轉乾坤。飛虎將軍陳納德氏日昨出席衆議院作證，陳述其個人對於援華問題的意見，曾力言軍事援華的重要性，謂此舉有助於阻止蘇聯在歐洲方面的侵略，否則第三次大戰卽不可避免。他並明說：「余相信蘇聯非至中國完全赤化在東方可高枕無憂之後，決不會在西方有所舉動。以故一俟中國完全赤化之後，吾人卽面臨一迫切的問題，不得不在參加第三次大戰抑或退守美洲大陸二者之間，抉擇其一。依余所見，中國實為世界和平的基點。吾人若以全國精力與資源集中歐洲，以備萬一，則將鑄成大錯矣。「這一席話，充滿了眞知灼見，但願美國朝野以捷克政變為鑒而三思之！</p>

<h3>安理會大國否決權　美主張應予限制　向小型大會正式提建議</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕紐約十一日廣播；成功湖訊，美國代表團今日正式向「小型大會」建議火事限制大國在安理會中之否決權。按去年九月間馬做爾國務卿曾表示美國　將否決權之運用，限於最重要之問題，如經濟裁制及使用武力等，其他次要之問題如有關程序等問題，否決權可以不必適用。本日美國所提建議，係此項主張之日體化。惟美國代表團發言人承認蘇聯尙無同意此種辦法之跡象，再者由於蘇聯拒不參加「小型大會」之故，縱使欲將該項問題提出討論，亦必須在聯合國全體大會提出，其後復需安理會加以通過，故前途障礙至多。但美國認為此項辦法具有如此重大意義，即使嘗試不成，亦屬値得一試。如美國之建議獲得通過，則渦去兩年由蘇聯曾使用否決權之各項問題，均將被擯於否決權範圍之外矣。</p>
<p>〔聯合社費城十日電〕菲律賓大使羅慕洛今夜在此演說，反對在聯合國機構外　設最高安全委員會，據稱，此稱集團乃聯合國之重大威脅，證明不信任該機構排解糾紛之能力，國際裂痕將　益擴大，而無婉勸妥協之餘地。此類主張應全部打消，並應採取下列措施，以增强聯合國機構之權力：（一）修正聯合國憲章，使其成為有節制的世界政府。（二）聯合國大會現僅可向會員國提出建議，今後應改組為一種直正議會，具有立法權以防止戰爭。（三）安理會　成為聯大之執行機關，如此可不受否決權之約束。</p>
<h3>美注意捷局發展　馬卿認情熱嚴重　各方對馬薩里克之死同伸哀悼</h3>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓十日電〕國務部馬歇爾今日招待記者稱，世界大局「極為嚴重」，此係指歐洲方面共產勢力擴展，捷克政變及美國方面因歐洲局勢種種發展大起衝動而言。馬氏並謂，「捷克外長馬薩里克之死，即為該國共黨統治已浩成恐怖世界之明證。馬薩里克之死是否出於自殺，如捷克官方所謂，則尙不知」。美國其他官員認為馬薩里克係被謀殺事屬可能。記者向義大利四月十八日之國會選舉，共黨亦有攫取政權之可能，各方情緖恐慌，岌岌不可終日，且有談及戰機一觸即發者，請對大局加以評價。馬氏答稱，「對時局發展，確有極大疑懼，美國方面且有極大衝動。局勢極為嚴重，感情衝動一至於此，殊可扼腕。』</p>
<p>〔路透社倫敦十日電〕艾德禮首相發表個人談話，對馬薩里克之死表示震驚。渠云，馬薩里克乃崇拜自由主義者，渠之自盡，係顯示不願繼續在極權制度的窒息氣氛中生存，渠之姓名將永遠為信仰自由者所崇拜。貝文外相在下議院中聲稱，馬薩里克外長及其父親之姓名，將永遠留存於英國人民的敬愛記憶中。邱吉爾於追述戰時在倫敦共疾苦之情景後，復曰，馬氏之死為一重大損失，但其光榮的姓名，將繼續為捷克人民之南針。</p>
<p>〔路透社巴黎十日電〕政界人士認馬薩里克之死為捷克自由最後崩潰之證明，可見西方國家愈有加緊團結之必要。</p>

<p>〔路透社倫敦十日電〕貝文外相在下院中拒絕保守黨議員史屈勞斯之建議，不願援用英蘇盟約第五條「簽約國將恪遵不得干涉其他國家內政之原則」之規定，以抗議蘇聯最近之行動。貝文指出渠於一月間發表之演說，已曾指責蘇聯之武斷行動，此外不願加添其他意見。</p>
<h3>捷克外交官　紛紛提辭職</h3>

<p>〔路透社奧斯陸十日電〕捷克駐挪成公使華特，於今夜宣布辭職。　〔合衆社墨西哥十日電〕此間外交部宣佈由於捷克國內最近之政治發展，政府已召喚駐捷公使返國「諮詢」。</p>
<h3>捷代表申訴　聯合國拒不受理</h3>
<p>〔路透社成功湖十日電〕捷克駐聯合國代表巴柏奈克昨致函聯合國秘書長賴依，要求安理會調査捷克局勢外，並曰聯合國會員國應決定是否承認捷克新政府。渠指責蘇聯官員直接參加捷共行動，並指史達林違反蘇捷友好條約。復曰政變以後，貝奈斯總統即不能發表公開談話，或出現公共塲所，渠已失去自由。共黨正盡力摧殘捷克之民主制度。巴氏復向記者表示，渠拒絕承認捷克新政權，但亦不願辭職，蓋渠自認仍為二月二十日以前捷克共和國之公僕。</p>
<p>〔聯合社成功湖十日電〕賴依今日與法律顧問及安理會主席蔣廷黻磋商後，決定對捷代表函加以置之不理。據稱，此函並非政府正式提出之申訴，照安理會議事規則，不能受理。</p>
<h3>蘇芬條約意義　在關閉北歐門戶</h3>
<p>〔路透社莫斯科十日電〕蘇聯半官刋物「蘇聯文學雜誌」發表社評稱，蘇芬友好互助條約將迅速緊閉華爾街之瑞典伙伴，允許其火西洋彼岸之朋友進人蘇聯邊界之門戶。世界之敵正在北歐煽動反對蘇芬條約，並使斯德哥爾摩成為反蘇之中心。芬蘭人民深知蘇芬條約乃獨立與自由之保障，亦為加强北歐及世界和平之新投資。</p>
<p>〔聯合社芬京十一日電〕巴錫基維總統昨與七人代表團會商赴莫斯科談判締結蘇芬條約事宜，陸軍總司令薛伏等蘇聯事務專家多人亦均出席。會前一部份團員聞曾要求總統收回委任成命，但巴氏答稱，「無論諸君願意與否，此係一項强迫工作。」</p>

<p>〔中央社華盛頓十日合衆電〕美參院頃已通過三項有關馬歇爾一援歐計劃之修正案，及否決將馬一卿計劃工作由聯合國主特之修正案，並規定十三日夜舉行兩種會議，其中一會議為緊急會議，以期對馬卿計劃有所決定，故本週內對於該計劃之行動必可完成。參院所通過之修正案為（一）取消以戰後自由輪三百艘，租與歡洲十六國之規定之修正案；（二）通過規定該計劃之運用，儘量利用私人貿易途徑之措施之修正案；（三）通過自歐洲救濟計劃中，取得西方國家之協助修正案。參院拒絕之修正案，為與華萊士同時提名競選副總統之泰勒所提出者。共和黨總統競選人塔虎脫贊成將歐洲復興計劃之經費自五十三億减至四十億美元，而共和黨外交政策主要發言人范登堡則要求維持原來數目。衆院方面旋放棄包括中希土之全盤援外法案，故將單獨討論歐洲復興計劃。</p>
<p>〔路透社華盛頓十一日電〕參院昨以七十三票對三票，否決第三黨副總統候選人參議員泰勒所提由聯合國機構管理對外救濟事宜之案。泰勒反對五十三億元之歐洲復興方案，而主張由美國補助聯合國機構五十億元，設立對歐洲之經濟復興管理機構。</p>

<p>貝奈斯總統尙在烏斯蒂別墅未返。馬薩里克慘死消息，係由內長諾賽克及外次克里曼蒂斯報吿總統。貝奈斯聞知此訊，悲痛自在意料中，馬薩里克非特為其最知己之閣僚，且為國內所餘唯一西方思想之代表，堪為其唯一臂助以遏制新國家陣綫之政策。貝奈斯夫人嗣即乘車赴普拉格，慰問馬薩里克之姊愛利斯，戈德華總理亦有專電致愛利斯致唁。　馬薩里克生前於星期日其父九八冥誕之日，曾赴拉尼志馬薩里克墓旁，獨自佇立，沉思良久，九日曾赴烏斯蒂謁見貝奈斯總統，亦即其父之摯友及學生。晚六時在官邸接見捷克駐倫敦大使館參贊普萊斯，接談一小時許，臨別馬降里克猶囑普萊斯於羿晨前往，蓋有若千函件托其帶往倫敦。最後與馬薩里克晤面之一人，為其僕役，時在九日晚八時三十分。十日晨馬薩里之衛隊發見馬氏已僵臥於石階上，蓋已自浴室躍樓自盡矣。頭部未曾受傷，雙目緊閉，似正酣睡然者。馬氏生平自奉甚儉，居處雖有五大間，實際僅使用兩間，一為臥室兼起坐室，一為浴室，起坐室中陳設簡單，宛如學生宿舍，絕不類堂堂外長官邸。</p>

<h3>書馬神童劉勃舒</h3>
<p>〔本報南昌九日航訊〕一個十三　的小孩，剛讀完小學的課程，跨進初中一年級，就能畫　大筆頭的大馬，雄鷄，在江西算是不多見的「神童」，在目前中國盡壇上，恐怕亦可稱為小畫家了。道個孩子的名字，呌劉勃舒，江西永新人，他是江西省立實驗小學的高材生。他的爸爸劉忠謀，在「實小」任敎師。他的媽媽，是道地的永新鄉姑娘出身，克動克儉，佐理他的爸爸治理家務，一家八口，全憑着劉忠謀一人的敎書所得，來維持生活，並敎養五個孩子。勃舒和哥哥在中學，還有二個弟弟在「實小」讀書，頂小的一個，正是日夜抱在他媽媽手上才不過一歲的小妹妹呢。</p>
<p>天才初現</p>
<p>小畫家劉勃舒，不但能作畫，而且能够放膽的在五尺貢萱上畫出雄糾糾的昂首大馬，設他是天才亦可，說是能够專心練習摸寫更可。原來他在六歲尙未入學時，隨着他的爸爸媽媽住在學校裏，看到一般孩子們上課，讀書，……過着學校生活，他已經是受着敎育的薰淘，所以在小時，他就喜歡用瓦片，粉筆在地下或是牆壁上亂塗，有時亦會畫隻瓶兒插花，或是小鷄飛跳，馬兒奔跑。到了入學讀一二年級時，常常積儲自己的點心錢，獨個兒躱着去買紙買墨，在房裏，畫飛機，汽車，龍燈和大馬，雄獅。因為他在戰時和他的爸爸，由安福駿馬回永新，更有機會，使他領略馬的姿態，增進畫馬的智慧。</p>
<p>繪畫比賽　他的處女作品——馬，首次被外人重視欣賞，是在十歲那年，那時他正在　新女師附小讀書，參加附小畫展，就「一鳴驚人」，榮獲全校展品的第一名。前年勝利復員後，他和爸媽等回到南昌「實小「讀書，參加南昌市學生繪畫比賽，又得小學組第一名，「小畫家」的榮譽，就在這二次畫展中奠定了基礎，同時更不啻是一劑鼓勵他上進的奮興劑。</p>
<p>請教大師</p>
<p>他曾經以四幅不同姿態的大馬，寄給在北平主辦中國藝術學院而為國內畫馬大師的徐悲鴻敎授請敎。</p>
<p>精神弟子</p>
<p>畫馬大師徐悲鴻，不遠千里得此高材，眞喜出望外，立刻回了一信，說：「學畫最好以「造化為師」，在寫馬必以馬為師，畫鷄即以鷄為師，細察其狀貌動作，神態，務扼其要，不尙瑣細」。徐敎誨他：寫馬還要熟悉馬的骨架，肌肉，組織，甚至要學馬的解剖。希望他——小畫家，立志一　要成為世界第一流美術家，母沾沾自喜，渺小成功。現在，劉勃舒已是徐大師的「精神弟子」。</p>
<p>畫買帖</p>
<p>他去年五月間曾在南昌中華書局看到徐大師的二本畫帖，沒有力量去將它買來，後乃商諸書局經理，允將作品數幅送在該局標賣，以售款所得，用償畫帖價款，小畫家的家庭經濟，由此可見一斑，他得徐帖以後，更努力於摹寫，在作品署名下，加蓋「師承悲鴻」的印章。據畫壇的朋友談：他最近自參閱畫帖之後的作品，確有很大的進步，尤其徐大師在一次給他的信上，加以指點敎誨後，更能控制紙面與墨色，寫出更精彩的作品來。</p>
<p>舉行展覽</p>
<p>最近他在南昌舉行過一次個展，更轟動洪都人士，他的作品，在三天之內，售出廿餘幀，獲得近千萬的畫資，最後的一天，有幾位外國朋友，看到他當衆揮毫，大加讚許，連陳列在畫展上的二張非賣品，亦被定購而去。</p>
<p>劉勃舒今日的成就，得力於他的天才，同時亦得力於學校的敎導與設備，道裏應當附帶的介紹小　家出生就讀的江西省立　　小學。</p>
<p>母校槪況</p>
<p>「實小」的創立，距今四十餘年，現由劉惟祐任校長，戰時雖然幾次的搬遷，但是從未中斷學生的課讀，現在有一千二百冬學生，聚集在一座舊式民房的建　校舍裏，一同讀書遊戲。從「實小」出身，升學留學的同學，不下五萬，今日在遠東法庭上坐着司法寳座，審訊日本戰犯的梅汝璈博士，小的時候，就是在「實小」讀完了小學課程的一個。</p>
<p>學校裏不但有圖書館，並且還有設備完善的藝術敎室，孩子們上着藝術課時，不拘形式的你描我畫，大家將自己的作品，懸掛在牆壁上，來個比賽。現在，另外的一個孩子的寫生畫，亦有相當成績。全校一千多個孩子，看到小畫家今日的成就，大家都高　學　。</p>
<p>白髪老師</p>
<p>「實小」一位老敎師韓祖德，在學校供職四十年，現已六十八歲，今巳　　　蒼，前年獲得敎育部甲等獎狀。現在他的精神很健旺，猶如壯年，這位老敎員對於小畫家過去在「實小」讀書的成績，一再讚許，他說：孩子在學校　就學，品學均優，每遇期考，成績均列優等，並且有愛幽靜，喜硏究的美德。（本報記者劉藻）</p>

<h3>大動脈鎗心針粵漢路設備積極改進美貸款加速交通建設</h3>
<p>〔本報廣州八日航訊〕華北戰火瀰漫，建設華南呼聲入雲之際，無疑綰載南北交通動脈的粵漢鐵路，最足使人重視，尤其自美國宣佈於貸款中指撥六千萬美元專事改良粵漢路設備之後，粵漢路的重要性，益加為人矚目。　粵漢路全長一千一百零六公里，勝利後中樞限令八個月內全綫　復通車，雖然能够如期完成，終因限於器材設備和經費問題，因陋就簡，所以勝利兩年多來，出事之多，幾使行旅視為畏途。尤以去年七月十日的英德橋覆車慘案，浮屍塡河，至今猶使人「談車色變」。近日復以沿綫奸匪時出滋擾，襲擊列車，破壞軌道，所以行車效率大减。當局為了確保華中華南的交通運輸，本來已經決心把它重新整頓一番，再加上美貸雅實之後，無異為貧血已久的粵漢路注射了一枝强心針。</p>
<p>據粵漢路當局表示：粵漢路在今年一年內，無論如何要大事改革。目前該路只有機車一百六十餘輛，可用的不過百輛，貨車千四百餘輛，客車三百餘輛，而全綫（連支綫廣九，廣三等綫在內）開行列車，每日即共達卅餘次，兼以管理技術上的問題，所以車廂大感缺乏，旅客買票，等上五七天，是平常事。復員以來，車廂旣未添購，而原有車廂又參差不齊，掛鈎高低不一，以致造成失事的主因。宋子文主任到職後，深感該路交通不暢，影響至鉅，所以第一着立刻請准交部調撥膠濟路停駛的貨車一百輛由水道兼程運來應用，最近即可運達。同時，聯總指撥的澳洲機車二十輛，聞本年內亦可運到應用，從此運輸量當可增加不少。粵路局長杜鎭遠並表示：北方車輛旣多停用，而粵路則需車孔亟，如果能增撥客車百輛篷車二百南來，則該路運輸保證可以到達理想的目標。</p>
<p>至於全綫的橋樑改善問題，據杜局長表示：該路為</p>
<h3>無錫發動春季清剿懸賞通緝匪首張卓如等</h3>
<p>〔本報無錫十日訊〕縣府以錫北殘匪時有出沒，特佈置春季淸剿計劃，務期澈底根絕，並限令奸匪自首，予以保障，茲錄其佈吿要點如下：（一）　賞通緝匪首張卓如，薛永輝·江華，繆南生陸道南等二十三名。（二）縣境內共匪，及通匪份子，再寬限自首日期，至本月二十日為止，逾限不來自首，一併緝拿歸案，依律重處。（三）縣境內居民，與上列通緝之匪首有親戚朋友，及師徒關係者，一律限本月二十日以前，向管轄之鄕鎭公所登記，本府當予以保障，縣府並召開淸剿會議，決定發動春季全面淸剿，以維治安。</p>
<p>改良橋梁</p>
<p>不至重演慘劇，已經費　最大的力量，自美英加三國購來大批鋼樑，準備在今年十月底前全部將木橋更換竣事。現在粵漢南段已經更換竣事。枕木所需，約數一百萬根，除在國內選購二十萬根之外，將全部仰給於暹羅。而鐵路改良的主要工作—鐵軌的更換，就非要等候美援不可了。</p>
<p>美貸的分配，雖然還尙在「樓梯　「的階段，然而交通當局確已經以開朗的心情去籌劃着怎樣把粵漢路眞的弄好，據奧路副局長林詩伯表示：要使粵路恢復戰前狀態，最少需四千萬美元，然則六千萬元貸款成功之後，也就無異為粵路解答了一個「只欠東風」的難題。究竟當局怎樣準備好好運用這一批貸款目前雖然還沒有正式的表示，但是從當局發表的一鱗半爪中和杜鎭遠局長的談話裏，大概除了一些技術的枝節問題外，當以以下的工作為主幹：</p>
<p>發展新綫</p>
<p>自湖南株洲至興化及粵北狗牙洞的運煤綫，是粵漢路燃料的泉源，據非正式估計，僅粵北狗牙洞一地的　煤，即可供全路　用四十年而有餘，只是限於交通運輸，所以不能從事採運，為了要解決全路動力，當然以興建此綫為首，聞交部刻已積極籌劃興建，於粵漢路更換新軌後以舊軌修築，預料明年可望竣工。其次則為興建貫通東南的韶　支綫（自韶關經始興·南集·贛縣·泰和·吉安·迄淸江）以與浙贛路相接，全長二百六十公里，完成之後，東南半壁，以迄西南邊陲，均將因此綫而聯成一氣，物質的交流，軍事的運輸，莫不嗟咄立舉，它的重要性，可想而知，所以宋子文主席飛京述職返穗後發表談話，特別强調興建韶贛綫必須從速興建。美援一到，大概當首先可以付諸實現。其他尙有自汕頭經興寗到廈門約六百餘公里的汕　綫，以及自廣州至澳門的廣澳支綫，亦將待於援款的興築（據悉汕廈綫曾有前曾投資建築平漢隴海兩路的比國某公司派員洽商承建，但因技術問題未能商洽，已吿擱淺），四支綫吿成，則可稱華南鐵路網已成其十九，而粵漢路的重要性，亦將與日俱增。</p>
<p>敷設新軌</p>
<p>為了戰爭的破壞，戰後復員的想促，粵　路的設備，簡直可以說沒有一樣够得上標準，尤以拚凑使用，陳舊不堪的路軌，經美工程師檢騐後，已認為不堪再用者，有五百四十七公里。而鋼軌的種類，竟有二十餘種。參差不齊，已足僨事。所以路局已經下了決心，　備貸款一到，立即更換新軌。鋼樑方面，全綫原有鋼樑五百餘孔，現在把原有的鋼樑拚　成樑，已經更換了三百餘孔，大概五月底以前可以全部更易，而將來韶贛支綫的興築則已決定在美以貸款價購新式鋼樑器材架設。大概當會比目前的設備優良得多了。開設</p>
<p>附屬工廠</p>
<p>粵漢鐵路器材，幾乎全部　結外國每年損耗至鉅，為　補救當局很平以前便已經計劃在廣州衡陽兩地籌辦大規模的機械廠專事生產修補全路所需器材，終於因為經費問題未有結果而吿延擱，（其間雖然曾經數度洽商對外借款及外人企圖投資，一時均未能成為事實）現在聞已準備　貸款中以四百萬美元在廣州西村籌建大規模的機械廠一座，並由交部撥給一部機械設備，並另於衡陽建設大　車廠一所，準備自行製　機車及一切配件，並將與資源委會合辦狗牙洞，及株州兩大煤礦，解決燃料問題。</p>
<p>全部計劃的具體決定，尙有待於此次杜鎭遠局長在京與交通當局的會商，然而，大家似乎都有一個信心，就是：「即使美援不來，為了要暢通這一條中國的大動脈，雖然困難一點，還是一樣要有計劃，要辦得更好！」（本報記者梁小中）</p>

<h3>仁餘報復力挫晨友</h3>
<p>靑白敗於恩卡斯</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕籃球甲組聯賽，昨晚甲二B東華三十六比三十二勝億中，錦標在握。甲一組仁餘五十二比四十九勝晨友，又甲一組補賽恩卡斯四十六比四十一勝靑白。賽畢有塲內看客數人，走向裁判員責難，並加以毆辱，籃聯會當軸正在澈査中。昨賽詳情如次：</p>
<p>東華勝億中</p>
<p>甲二B東華戰無不勝，昨晚又以卅六比卅二克億中，上半時雙方致力於保守，十五比八，下半時廿一比廿四，億中實力亦可見一斑·現東華僅存對央航一戰，甲二B錦標已無問題。</p>
<p>仁餘勝晨友</p>
<p>甲一組第一塲仁餘對晨友一仗，勢均力敵旗鼓相當，上半時廿八比廿六，晨友祗落後二分，比賽始終在劇烈爭奪中，仁餘微佔上風而已。</p>
<p>下半時形勢依舊，彼此投籃功夫均頗俱把握，兩隊若能併合組織，不難成一枝良好人馬。按之技術方面，年齡方面，都有希望，無奈雙方精神方面，恐不易合作成功。</p>
<p>在最後三分鐘時，晨友主將二員已五次犯規離塲，但作戰力絕未减色，結果仁餘僅以五十二比四十九獲勝。</p>
<p>恩卡斯勝靑白</p>
<p>昨晚甲一組第二塲為靑白對恩卡斯，上一塲在七時四十五分鐘完畢，這一塲因為裁判員問題的爭辨，直至七時五十五分方開始·蔡演雄的一擲一罰，陳祥龍的拍進一球，輕易掛上五分，恩卡斯經鮑萊奧柴遼等之努力，逐漸進逼，周達雲亦遠　中，十分鐘內靑白得以十一比八前導。一瞬間忽被追成十一　大三兩次平手，從此比賽更緊張，但十八平手後番兵即脫頴而出，上半時恩卡斯廿四，青白二十。</p>
<p>下半時青白張少卿易出陳祥龍，恩卡斯亦更動，當蔡演雄周遙雲相　命中時，對方頗呈慌亂狀態。不久番兵又順利，而兩軍動作均動火，結果恩卡斯以四十六比四十一勝靑白。比賽剛畢，忽有塲內觀衆向裁判楊烈誠君責駡動武，當軸正在調査中。最近球塲風氣似較往日為佳，不料有此事件發生，殊為憾事。</p>

<h3>學校行政棘手的問題今日大學訓導</h3>
<p>— 孫道遠</p>
<p>今日大學行政裏最感繁難而棘手的問題，恐莫過於訓導一批自田放蕩的大學生使其　規蹈矩了。這個訓導工作不是空泛的理論家所能辦好的，必須學識經驗與品德並優者才能够勝任愉快。筆者過去實地從事大學訓導有年，現在特對目前大　訓導揭發一點意見，以求方家指敎。</p>
<p>（一）什麽是，學訓導？</p>
<p>凡實地從事或硏究大學訓導者都了解：人類的敎育生活是一個連續發展的過程，本沒有絕對大小或高低的界限的。但是為求敎育的序幕適合人的生理發育之由小而大；心理發展之由微而著；智能增進之由低而高的差異·便把整個敎育的全程，分成大中小三級而　敎。</p>
<p>三級制的敎育過程，可謂中外例行，古今一轍的。道確與人生由幼而壯，由壯而老之三部曲調是全盤協調的。於是不論中小或大學各有它顯然獨在的時性，使人一見而知：這是巍　最高學府，那是　　兒童樂園，這種獨特的校風養成，就是我們實施「訓導」的目標。雖然各級學校都是一律採行班級敎學，但是在「訓導」實施上，却各　有不同的特質。</p>
<p>內在各有不同</p>
<p>我們從表面上去看，大中小學的訓導實施本是大同小異，沒有什麽顯然的差別。但從它　本質上去看，却各有不同的內在。我們如從「訓導」的作用方面去說：小學是偏於「育」，中學是偏於「管」，大學是偏於「導」；如從「訓導」的精神方面去說：小學是重於「愛」，中學是重於「嚴」，火學是重於「德」；換言之，小學是仁道的「訓育」，中學是覇道的「訓練」，大學是王道的「訓導」。再就訓導實施的目的去說：「育」在助其成長，「管」在使其歸範，「導」在促其自治。所以各級訓導的形態是不相同的，小學是「撫育」，中學是「硬管」，大學是「示範」。</p>
<p>從前一段分析裏，我們可以知道：小學的調育是先生的問題，有了好先　，就可以　養　好學生；中學是先生和學生雙方的問題，不但要有好先生，還要有好學生，才可以使「訓導」收到圓滿的效果。但是大學却不然，所有「訓導」的成果，却完全在　學生的素質怎樣？如學生素質好，人人能够自覺的去做人，自動的去學習，自治的去管理。這樣何患不能養成一種優美的學風，達到　學訓導的理想境界呢？所以大學訓導的成敗，完全在　學生能不能自覺，自動，自治；反之，大學訓導的目標就是在　進和指導學生能够自覺，自動，自治。</p>
<p>讓他自由發揮</p>
<p>然而為什麽要採行不同的訓導方式呢？原因是各級訓導的對象不同。例如正在發育滋長的小學生，方踏上成人之路的起點，不但自身沒有健全，而對自身以外的一切都很渺茫，必須時時把他當作「成人」似的去撫育，才可使他自然而又健全的成長起來。但是經過六年小學敎育的中學生，已能言行自由，不但能自知個人以外的一切人事，並富有好奇的心理與實驗的勇氣。所以一個靑年在中學時期是屆於思想紛歧而行為奔放時代；也可以說是正居於人生的十字街頭，是危險而又是最有希望的時候，一入歧途，那就不堪收拾了。在此人生之途最緊要的關頭上，惟有嚴加管敎，才可使其就範，一到經過六年中學基本敎育的大學生，做人的基礎已經大定，只須從旁稍予指導，即可自覺百動了。所以對於大學生儘可讓他自由去發揮充實，以完成他自己。因之，完美的大學敎育是由於健全的中學敎育基礎上發揚出來的。</p>
<p>（二）怎樣實施大學訓導？</p>
<p>我們明白了大學訓導的重心在以德化人，以促進學生自治，既不像對小學生那麼撫愛，又不可像對中學生那樣硬管。</p>
<p>要靠通力合作</p>
<p>然而我們又怎樣去實施大學訓導呢？這是不易解答的一個問題。但是我想，凡是今日實地從事大學訓導工作者，都會感覺到今日大學訓導的成敗，不單是一個大學訓導處下分設生活管理，課外活動，體育衛生各組與其本身組織的問題。因為一個大學　整個訓導處不過是處理日常訓導行政事務的級織機構；換言之，它只能做到訓導方面的消極工作，至於積極方而的訓導必要靠天天站在學生前而執敎的全體敎授們通力協作，庶可奏效。（未完）</p>

<p>華股昨刺激加強，游資湧來，十一種漲停，新高價頻創，熱烈興奮。惟永紗高後不免恍惚，套轉雜股之風漸盛，趨勢將盛。　晨初即以中央櫃台之籌設，及美貸議案暫擱之訊而開高，永紗以一四二五元及一五四三元登塲，即合息價須三角以上。四號等出遞交，一八〇號等脫售即交，退為一四一五元及一五三○元。九五號等進遞交，二二八號等買即交，升至一四四〇元及一五四五元。九八號等尙賣遞交，二二四號等了結即交，退為一四一〇元及一五一八元。二一二號等紛購即交，一八三號等買遞交，永紗拉高到一四六〇元及一五七〇元。此時華　信誼中法華新商務俱吿漲停，銀根與現鈔奇緊，掉期昂至三角三四分。二二〇號等出遞交一九二號等了結即交，曾回小至一四二〇元及一五四二元。外圈仍躍，洋股更甚，業中人仍吿鼓勵。一五七號等奮買遞交，一七一號等奮買即交，近午乃漲到一四六〇元及一五八〇元，而後以一四四七元及一五七九元收市。較前收即交股華豐商務信誼恒　漲停，華新中法升一成，新光景福火柴國貨中匯景綸中絲好半成，大通跌半成，內衣微挫，餘均小升。遞交股華豐漲停，餘成升一成及成牛强。</p>
<p>後市圈外刺激及港電襯托加强，上塲永紗即見升至一四七〇元及一五八五元，八三號等賣到一四四六元及五五三元，雜股生色，信誼·中法·搪瓷·恒豐。·永業·中興·商務·統益·中絲·火柴等紛吿漲停板，人心仍俏。三號等進遞交，一八〇號等進即交，新高價達一四九〇元及一五九五元。一五七號等逢高脫手，收市為一四八五元及一五七八元。較晨計即交股恒豐。中興。中紡。商務。中絲。華豐，火柴·中法·信誼漲停·統益·華新漲停後有　，火通升成半，新光。永公。景福升半成，中泥·景綸平平，餘者榮辱俱微。遞交股華豐漲停，永紗微挫，餘均微升。塲外各未上市股票，均吿微升迄一成弱不等。</p>
<p>套利買賣，昨頭寸不敷所求，一再步高·空方及套利者可擭息自二角八至三角二，永紗初開貼價為一〇〇元，自九八元升至一一五元收市·信和初開五五元，收市五二元，餘股咸屬預定性質。</p>
<p>遞延交易，存帳即日起由六十億元改定為二百億元。</p>
<h3>債秀發外股疊高</h3>
<p>公債昨見秀利，大成興承德及五〇三室賣出，五〇〇室五五〇室五五五室均進。統丙晨開一一萬二，即升至一二萬三而後稍平。較前收計甲乙升三千元，丙戊漲七千元，統丁升二千元，成交約三百萬。</p>
<p>外股昨更熱烈，普遍遭游資所爭逐，尤以紙版鋼業及橡皮股為尤甚·港電大縮，有求少供，各熱股無不飛黃騰達，迭創新高峯·廣帮及洋商咸扒，僅證券帮及散戶有供，較前收計橡皮股及鋼業紙版各漲二成，餘股亦好起一成　至成半不等。</p>
<h3>印度禁我生絲入口加工外銷決暫停辦</h3>
<p>中央銀行，去年為爭取外匯，曾領導中信局，中蠶公司，絲織業等有關單位，組織絲織產銷協導會。將政府收購生絲加工外銷，並織成綢緞十萬疋，遝印銷售·本年計劃加工二十五萬疋銷印，中蠶公司副總經理湯錫祥，特於日前赴京，向全經會，經濟部請示。頃悉，政府近以國內外價格特殊，而印度又禁止入口，對印加工外銷決暫停辦，中信局最近成交之四百二十包，展限本月十五日進口。</p>
<h3>銀根緊門售淡　食米大漲小回　油市來貨稀少開價步告</h3>
<p>米市大漲後，昨見小回，以上日收市本已露疲，故昨日甫行開市，即吿下游，良以錫地產價已定，銀根甚感緊迫，米店門售因戶口米之普還發售，甚形清淡，店胃旣呆，行家更少添辦矣。貨主之需要銀根者，頻見吐售。</p>
<p>除北市塲白粳獨挺三萬外，其他均下挫五萬至十萬元。南市塲白粳三百六十五萬，計降十萬元。早薄稻各小五萬，秈米除高羊秈尙平外，其他亦小五萬元。白元退為三百八十萬元，北市塲特高粳仍站三百八十五萬原價。將臨收市，因天氣下雨，人心稍堅，市略轉定。</p>
<p>麵粉</p>
<p>起伏狹隘，結果略較上日爲低。因米價之回低，人心不無影響，加以銀根緊，及廠方有開出，供臘殊為充裕。</p>
<p>老車粉開盤一百四十八萬元，後退一百四十七萬五千，送到價為一百四十八萬元，兵船一百四十七萬開後，收市為一百四十六萬，棧單各低於上日一二萬元。紅蜂，建成，各較上日稍疲約萬元。建成最高至一百四十六萬，收市為一百四十四萬五千元。雜牌粉本街實銷尙多，孔雀送到為一百四十六萬五千元，麩皮疲莫能興，大包收市低於上日一萬元。</p>
<p>雜糧</p>
<p>先平後挺，初開時因米價之下降，人心至為不振，故開盤甚平。黃豆因產地不低，貨主不願多脫，開市勉站鼠價，後聞油餅俱升，油廠紛來納取。漢口乍豆初為一百八十萬，最後成交價為一百八十八萬元，（同甡泰油廠所進），較上日升八萬元。車豆初二百萬，後買不進。平湖特粗見二百三十八萬新高價。</p>
<p>苞米初開帶疲，後靑島帮來取，轉昂二三萬。紅糧挺升五萬至十萬，菉豆本客帮均取，存薄，升十萬餘。揀靑平疲，芝麻津幚未納，僅黃藤及奶蔴升五萬，白蔴平定·生仁廣帮雖納而不多，價亦升約二十萬，高貨挺三十萬元。今日國父逝世紀念，停市一天。</p>
<p>食油</p>
<p>開市即見躍升，因來貨轉稀，及產價不賤，更因業外各物之猛漲，執主咸抱堅持少脫之意。又因今日市塲停市，本街預為添納者亦多，是以去化尙稱活絡。</p>
<p>先開回籠貨，大有豆油由七百〇五萬起，節節開高，最高達七百二十五萬，收市為七百二十萬，較上日升二十萬元。後大統，長德等廠，以七百二十萬開出，吉桶生油突出八百萬大開，靑島吉桶生油八百二十萬，江北吉桶生釉八百二十萬，各較上日挺三十萬。生熟菜油均升約二十萬，吉桶小車蔴油由七百七十萬開後，直登八百萬大關，計漲四十萬。豆餅汕頭帮納挺升四五萬元。</p>
<p>洋米到滬</p>

<h3>茶商討論貨款問題　本年外銷箱茶可達卅六萬市担</h3>
<p>中國茶業協會鑒於本年度茶貸問題，關係重要。特於日昨下午二時召集上海茶輸出業同業公會，上海市茶行商業同業公會及第一二區製茶工業同業公會，　浙皖贛各產區代表，在本市銀行俱樂部開會，商　對於各茶商由請茶貸數目，及（甲）生產貸款，（乙）見　貸款，及（丙）定貨貸款各項利弊，均詳加討論。由該會理事長　景偉主席，當經公　壽景偉·孫曉村·朱惠淸。·曾雨辰·唐季珊·宋啓範·方君强·吳覺農·黃燕堂等九人，擬共切實辦法，再與主管輸出貿易及茶貸金融各方面洽商一切，至五時許始宣吿散會。</p>
<p>〔又訊〕據茶業界有資格人士估計，本年度外銷箱茶可達卅六萬市担，包括紅茶九萬市担，綠茶十五萬市担，台茶十二萬市担，依照目前外匯市價推算，全部出口可換取二千餘萬美元云。</p>
<p>〔又訊〕據中茶協會預計，本年度各區茶產量如下：平水綠茶七萬担，祁門紅茶一萬担，溫州紅茶七千担，河口紅茶三千担，屯溪綠茶三萬担，福建綠茶二萬五千担，又紅茶二萬五千担，及其他產區數量萬担，共計二十四萬一千担。收購價格，每担若以五石米計，每担米以三百萬元計，全部資金共需三萬六千餘億元。</p>
<h3>捲菸瘋狂上漲</h3>
<p>昨日捲菸市塲，喊價紊亂，塲內竟呈缺乏供應狀態，各烟再創新高峯。十支大英烟又衝破九千萬大關，直上至九千五百五十萬元收市，猛騰達一千一百二十萬元之鉅。老刀烟衝出八千萬關，高至八千四百萬元，亦漲一千一百五十萬元。其餘中外各烟亦步秀半成至二成左右。</p>
<h3>紙圈不虞匱乏自給自足年內實現</h3>
<p>本市捲烟紙用量，前經調查每月約需十二萬圈，本市民豐造紙公司所　嘉興民豐紙廠所出之捲烟紙圈，為國產之惟一佳品，每月產量為三萬圈，不敷市塲需要甚鉅。輸管會乃不得不准美貨捲紙輸入以資彌補，民豐廠潔知國家外匯困難，迭奉政府督促，竭力設法，將前存香港之機器一架裝運到禾。試製結果，成績優良，現已開始製造，估計每月可增出三萬圈，合原有產量，每月可產六萬圈，然於實需，尙感不敷，而民豐本廠為動力設備所限，一時已無再加紙機可能。頃聞該公司已另闢增產新途徑，就其姊妹廠杭州華豐紙廠內，裝設製捲烟紙機器兩架，其中一架，六七月問可以出品。尙有一架，須俟添建廠屋完工後，年內亦可開製。該兩機每月亦可出六萬圈，合計兩廠每月可出十二萬圈，足敷市塲實際需要。在杭州華豐紙廠未能生產捲烟紙之前，據菸業日報所載第四季紙圈進口數量總計各廠定貨為廿一萬餘圈，平均每月計七萬圈，再加民豐出品每月六萬圈，其數已足敷本市各於廠所需要，目下絕無匱乏之虞·再經民　華豐兩廠努力生產之結果，年內即可完成自給自足之境，在此節約外匯，倡用國貨之國策下，實為經濟產業界一好消息也。</p>
<h3>水泥業需用紙袋請規定美金數額</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕全國水泥公會為配合經濟改革方案，擬請當局依據全國水泥工廠實際產量，規定每月准許輸入紙袋美金數額，俾資增產而利外銷，近特具呈行政院·全經會·經濟部·中央銀行·輸管會等，有所聲請。原呈略稱：預計本年六月底，全國水泥總生產量，可激增至每月十九萬五千八百五十公噸。紙袋一項，月需達三百九十一萬七千隻之鉅，惟目下向美定製紙袋，每隻約合〇·一五美元，如依本年六月底全國水泥總生產量加以估計，每月需用外匯，不過五十八萬七千餘美元。而一日海外市塲得能如願開闢，則假定逐月轍出水泥一百萬包，每包以F.O.B一·五〇美元計算，外匯收入，即可三倍於是。故務望規訂每月准許輸入美金數額，以利生產云。</p>
<h3>中澳貿易協定明日正式公告</h3>

<h3>特種外幣存單　進出口商要求下季一倂抵用</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕本市進出口商業同業公會，為特種外幣存單，原定第四季起抵用。茲以手續關係，未及發出應規定於發出後，在下閔季得將第四季起可抵之額，一併抵用。特代電致中央銀行曁輸出入管理委員會，原文如下：「竊查輸出入管理委員會第七號公告，無許可蹬自備外匯到埠及起運貨品處理辦法施行細則第五條：「登記合格進口商，自本年十一月起，得將前項特種外幣存單，按季向中央銀行抵借票面六分之一之外匯，支付其限額以內許可進口之貨款」之規定。謹按本條所指十一月起，實即包括自第四季限額開始，迭經本會代表等前於晋謁鈞座懇商時，共認為不爭之事實。惟該自備外匯到埠貨物，自開始收購配售以來，因審議核布收購配售轉輾呈遞各種手續關係，此項特種外幣存單，至今尙未有一紙發出。而第四季限額，早巳竣事；匯票亦巳紛紛開出，進口商行未有一家能用此存單，以抵付第四季限額外匯者。本會迭據會員請求，轉懇鈞座，體恤商艱，顧念事實，將此特種外幣亦單，正式規定為第四季起抵用抵借。其有因收購配售手續關係，未及在第四第五季前領到存單，而無法抵用時，則在下一季配額中，得將以前應用及可借之各季之額，一併抵用抵借，俾符法令，而免爭執。此項請求，理雖屬於當然，而事宜川之明令，用特電陳事實，仰祈鑒准公布施行，以利商業云云。</p>

<p>新醫與新藥</p>
<h3>自全國醫聯大會歸來</h3>
<p>— 梁俊靑</p>
<p>筆者此次追隨滬上醫界諸老前單前往南京出席第二届全國醫師公會聯合大會者共有三日，見見聞聞頗多感觸，頗擬走筆記之。惟因事關大會今　且與本刋無關，故爾暫作金人之械口，留待他日之機緣，嗟乎，黄鐘瓦釜，滔滔者天下皆是矣，吾又何必作豐干之嘵舌，有所取　於人乎。是故別開生面，摭拾其與醫藥有關者，倘亦爲讀者諸君所見許歟？</p>
<p>（一）周部長之警惕詞句此次大會開幕之初，衛生部周部長曾致開幕詞，並有警惕之詞句曰：「世界各國衛生工作成績之最美滿者莫如北歐諸國，其人之平均壽命約在六十五歲左右。我國因衛生設備之不良以及嬰孩死亡率之高，遂致平均壽命减低至三十左右。其實人生之事業開始於四十歲左右，今茲我國人之平均壽命短促若此，則豈能與歐美各國爭短長乎？是又有待於全國醫藥界之臂助者也」。斯言可謂語語中的，眞是語重心長。不特凡我醫界均須同心協力爲衛生當局之臂助，即如一般讀者亦須有所警惕，善自珍攝，毋貽東亞病夫之譏也。</p>
<p>（二）國產西藥商之哀鳴此次大會中承蒙國產西藥商之盛宴招待，衷心非常感激。惟楊氏化學硏究所所長楊博士曾有沉痛之演詞曰：「我國所用之西藥大半皆爲舶來品，其間雖有國人創設藥廠自製西藥，但因國人崇拜西藥之劣根性，只知購用舶來品而不知提倡國產西藥，遂致國產西藥無從發展，良可慨也。」其實國產西藥初不下於舶來之物。特以崇拜舶來品之奴性心理所操縱，遂致摒棄良好之國產西藥而不用，斯眞令人痛心疾首者耳。方今國步艱難，外匯往往無從購買，且目前之世界正在杌隉不寗，萬一再有第三次世界大戰，則一切之舶來西藥定必無從購買，豈不令病者坐以待斃乎？是故爲未雨綢繆計，自須於可能範圍中極力扶助國產西藥之發展。將來精益求精扶搖直上又安知其不凌駕舶來品之上乎？予固深盼我國醫藥界以及全國國民之覺醒也。</p>
<p>（三）旅行之益處告人蟄居滬上，整日生活於驚濤駭浪之環境中，不特兩鬢易霜，容顏易老，且亦心力交瘁，難亭遐齢。筆者勾留白下，爲期不過三日，而因改換環境關係，精神爲之煥發，胃納爲之增强。　昔之失眠易醒者如今則上床即睡一寐天明，與前判若兩人，斯眞旅行之所賜也。予甚願滬上人士於春秋佳日多作短期旅行，則其所得益者定必多於其所失者矣。</p>
<p>（四）旅行之害處旅行對於吾人身體雖然益處甚多，而其爲害之亦不小。蓋吾人整居一地，其地氣候之變化固已成爲習惯，不致受其影響。設一旦出外旅行，自難適應於異地之氣候。則因之而感染生病，固亦甚爲可能之情事耳，然而其最足爲害吾人身體厥惟日光。蓋據最近之醫學報吿，人身體內之物質，可以因涵量之不同而對於太陽光發生　種過敏現象。有人於陽光旅行一二小時即行中暑而死者。又有人於陽光下照晒一二小時即行發生皮膚炎或疱疹者（吳天民醫師受太陽照晒後立即皮膚發炎，此次在南京旅行中會親眼看見其受太陽照射後之發炎情形）。又有人平素臉色白凈一經太陽照射立即變爲黑炭者。凡此種種胥與太陽光綫有關。倘或亭前未有相當之準備，則旅行於陽光之中不但未得其利反爾得其害處，實爲不値之至耳。</p>
<h3>醫藥新聞</h3>
<p>— 蒼龍</p>
<p>（一）在肺結核癥中盜　江失眠之治法</p>
<p>據瑞士Mauderli氏及Magg氏報吿，在肺結核症之患病時期中往往有疲倦無力，食慾不振盜汗失眠以及心跳等等現象。有許多人以爲病者體虛所致，逐給予各種補藥，結果不但毫無效驗。反爾病根日深。其實上述之盜汗失眠等等症象乃爲自動神經機能失常所致，如給予節制自動神經之藥物（例如山德士藥廠所出之Bellergal）則見效甚速云。</p>
<p>（二）小孩玩弄器物吸入氣管內之危險</p>
<p>據去年二月份匈牙利兒科學報上載，有一個六歲小孩於玩要時忽然大哭不止，其父母詢其原因則謂吞入一釘。於是送入醫院診治。但在醫院內再三以愛克司光檢查亦未撿得有任何異物在腹內。於是以爲小孩或係謊言而已，遂令還家。但回家不久之後小孩忽發高熱逐漸有肺炎及肋膜炎現象，歷時許久未能痊愈。於是將其送入匈牙利國最大之兒科醫院診治。結果竟於愛克司光中檢得其左氣枝管分　處有長約三十三米厘米突之玻璃片。惟因該項異物吸入氣管內已有四月，其四週已經生有肉芽將其包住，不易取出。於是只能用特種器械方得將其取出。而小孩之氣管因有長期之異物侵襲已經發生慢性炎症甚爲嚴重，幸得配尼西靈之大量注射方得痊愈云。</p>
<p>據去年八月份維也納醫學週報刊載美國紐約成立一所眼角膜儲蓄庫，以備患角膜渾濁症者之需要。據稱最近已有五千盲目病人經用角膜移植術後重見光明。</p>
<p>（四）小兒性脊髓前角炎之濾性毒</p>
<p>據天國加里福尼亞省之史丹福大學報吿　現在已能以超顯微鏡之檢查方法將小兒性脊髓前角炎之濾過性毒完全分析成功。據稱此種濾性毒乃爲一種類似蛋白質之物，約有廿五密克隆（即Mikron等於千份一之米厘米突）之直徑。基於此種發現將來可以製成預防漿云。按此種病症最近在上海亦有發現，初發時高熱，嘔吐，昏迷，抽筋，多汗，若於二三日未有死亡則逐漸痊愈而成爲麻痺症，例如一手一臂不能動，或一足一腿不能走之類。此癥甚爲棘手。縱能醫治亦甚費時間。且其傳染性亦甚大。若能注射預防漿苗則於上海市民大有裨益也。</p>
<p>（五）去年九月之國際性風濕癥討論會</p>
<p>去年九月問在丹麥京城哥本哈根曾舉行國際性之風濕症討論大會，內容有一傳染性風濕關節炎之原因及其發展經過情形」，「傳染性風濕關節炎之治療問題」，以及「風濕癥對於人類威脅之意義」「風濕症中之氣候問題」等均有詳細之檢討。容於暇時著文述之。</p>
<h3>送王爵榮醫師出國</h3>
<p>— 馬殿</p>
<p>王君爵榮，震旦大學醫學博士也·懸壺滬巿有年，而不　獲與締交，差近一載；自其任職吾醫師公會始·在過去十一月之中，　欬相接，不獨深佩其識見卓越，言辭敏捷；而尤感其服務精神，非常人所可及。君本多勞：設診所，主藥房，長醫院，董藥廠，平日周旋於各異階層間，已不勝奔走之勤；猶分餘緒，爲吾滬全市同道服務：整治公會會務，創設醫訊社址，而遇醫病紛糾，尤能一鞭當先，躬與法醫檢驗，公團公證之役，甚至廢寢忘食而不顧，見義勇爲，有如此者。且君也，任勞任怨，功成不居；爲公犧牲之至誠，足勵激世而鏚末俗，固不第吾醫界同人感奮已也。去秋王君新膺友邦法國敎育部之選，不日即將出國；遠涉重洋，再求深造。當然舊有國內事業，不得不暫委人代；惟其身兼數職，應付不倦之熱忱，誰亦難乎爲繼！故君此行，在私當爲之雀躍；在公則不無悵惘也！茲則行有日矣，爰援古人半紙輸情之義，藉本刊一隅，微伸餞別之辭。夫今日中國醫事衛生之蕪雜，不容自諱。其原因期不一端，而醫政無正鵠，實爲厲階。蓋近數十年來，國內迄未造就爲公犧牲風度之眞正醫政人才；醫政之難上軌道，自不足咎！所以希望王君此去，除硏究醫　新知，以爲其舊有事業發揚光大外；稍分餘緒，對於國外醫政，更作他山之攻錯，發其眞諦，歸爲國家貢獻。逆知前比曾爲吾全滬同道服務者；將來進爲全國同道服務，其　全國同胞造福，又豈難事哉！行矣王君，珍重，珍重！</p>
<h3>漫談小兒性血液吐瀉癥</h3>
<p>— 吳曼青</p>
<p>小兒性血液吐瀉癥爲一種罕見之病症，其原因至今亦未能完全明瞭·猶憶Walter　Nischer氏（爲著名之德國病理學家，戰前在德國盧斯獨克大學任病理學院院長，一度亦曾任同濟大學醫科病理學敎授，其精湛之學識與偉大之人格至今尙爲早年畢業之同濟學生所稱道）曾經主張，「吾人以後倘或遇有此類病者，則無論如何必須加以詳細之檢騐，務期澈底明暸其病因。」因此引起予之興趣，特將最近研究所得之情形縷述如下：</p>
<p>關於小兒性血液吐瀉症（Melaena　Neonatorum）命名之由來，吾人可以上溯西哲Hippakrates氏（希波克拉德士）之論文，藍彼於西曆紀年前四百年間早已爲文論述此病（見De　Marbis　H,73）且稱之爲Marfus　niger　Hippokrates也。據後人Kleler氏之解釋，則知所謂小兒性血液吐瀉症者乃爲一種小兒腸胃方面出血甚多之病症，其症之發生多在小兒初生之數日或數星期內，發作時吐瀉甚劇，所吐或所瀉之物均爲血液或血塊或則帶黑色之塊狀物（血液遇胃酸則成黑色）。其出血之發生時期則多在小兒初生之一二天內，而其最遲發生者則在生產後之第十八天云。</p>
<p>其出血之最劇者往往於四十八小時後即因失血過甚而死。惟據Nleischmano氏報吿，則亦見有小兒之患此症，而延長至於十七日後方始死亡者。Anders氏曾上溯醫事文獻至於一八八五年，結果只能數得共有四十八人曾患此症，而據Hecker氏報吿，則謂約在五百新生小兒中可能有一人患之。惟據Gennrich氏統計所得，則謂德國柏林之產科醫院中約於一千次生產中遇有一人患有此症云。</p>
<p>關於此症之發生原因，則言人人、殊，莫衷一是Ruge氏以爲患此者約有二種原因，其一則爲全身發作性之病症例如凡有梅毒或細菌入血，或患急性之脂肪疸壤症者均可患之。而其他則爲局部之原因，蓋其局部之有血液循環障碍或則在腸胃方面患有潰瘍症者亦可有之云。惟臨床方面之報告，則上述之所謂潰瘍症者往往亦可發生於生存之新生小兒中。至於Prof　DR.　Entz氏之報告，則謂據其調查統計所得，約右百份柜之潰瘍性病者均在十二指腸部份發生，且均爲營養不良非常瘦弱之小孩云。根據上述諸氏之意見，可以歸納之成一結論如下：「小兒性血液吐瀉症之發生大半由於胃腸或食道管下段以及胃門上部之潰瘍所引成，而其潰瘍生成之直接原因以及發生之地點，發生之時間則尙未完全明瞭也」.</p>
<p>Spiegelberg氏以爲潰瘍之發生、早已在母胎之中開始。而Landau氏則以爲非是，彼極力主張此症之發生由於「小兒初生之後其呼吸作用尙未完全正常，因肺內之空氣尙未開展　，而原來供作肺動脈與大動脈互相聯系之彼氏管（Ductus　Botalli）及臍部靜脈管則發生血栓作用，再由此種血栓而游離血塊於動脈管中，最後則將此游離之血槐緊塞於胰腺與十二指腸間之動脈內，遂致成爲潰瘍云。」V.　Frauque氏以爲上述此種退行性血栓形成之理論頗有理由。蓋其血栓之作用可以引起血管之痙　性阻塞（Embelisce　Gefanversperrumg）復由於血管之阻塞而促成潰瘍以及潰瘍部份之出血。同時又因其阻塞之關係遂有血流之鬱積，心臟之疲乏，血管壁層之脆弱以及血管壁層滲透力之變態等等，故能大量地發生出血而成爲血液性之上吐下瀉也。予曾見有一例，其症情非常明顯，茲特附誌於此以爲讀者參考：</p>
<p>「有一個小孩於「第二前頭位置中」產生。初生時毫無呼吸，經用各種人工呼吸救急術一小時後方能呼吸。然而臉色總帶靑紫，而呼吸亦非當急促。嗣於第二天中見其臉色更加青紫，瞳孔放大，兩眼凝視形如鬬鷄之眼。病者且曾昏厥數次。嗣後病者即有血便，呼吸减緩，熟度高至卅八度三。繼則血便不止，且有高熱，（三十九度四）。最後則於第四天中死亡</p>
<p>此病孩之體重爲三兛又廿格蘭，身長49cm。頭部周圍34cm，肩寬35cm。皮色非常慘白。臍部正常，但有一段約8cm之臍帶突出，且有黄綠色之　液包圍其四周。解部時發現其臍動脈及臍靜脈均有鵝毛管粗細之血塊粘着。其血塊作深紅色而粘附於血管壁內。在肋膜及心肌外膜中有無數之小型出血斑點，以手指壓之亦不退消。其脾臟有輕度之腫大。其食道管有正當之大小，但甚爲貧血。僅在第一段內有顯明之血栓現象。在胃臟之人口處5mm長，三米厘米突闊之圓形潰瘍，四週均有充血狀態。胃內空虛無物，粘膜未曾變厚而有血液鬱積狀態。幽門附近亦有潰瘍甚大，且有積血甚多，其腸部自腔腸以下至肛門爲止皆有黑色之血塊甚多，惟間亦有作液體之血水者。」</p>
<p>吾人試將上述情形加以詳密之考慮，則可以推論此孩臍部靜脈之發膿狀態實可認爲引起臍部血管栓塞之直接原因。若因臍部血管栓寒後發生所屬區域之血栓作用，甚而至於促成腸胃部份之潰瘍發生，要亦甚有充份之理由也。</p>

<h3>「自掃門前雪」</h3>
<p>— 吳庸</p>
<p>遜淸同治十三年的申報上載有一篇題目呌做「滬城問答」的文章，記述一個西人與一個華人之間的問答。西人初來上海，遨遊城郭，見城門口斷磚瓦礫，堆積如山，無人淸除，道路幾爲之阻塞，看了頗爲不解，乃詢問華人，以明究竟；那位華人多方設辭解辯，可是西人總覺不能釋然於懷，仍是多方追問，華人不耐，厭他多管閑事，乃答西人道：「君海外人，何必饒舌。諺云；各人自掃門前雪，休管人家瓦上霜，君亦請事斯語可乎？」西人曰：「噫！旣日各人自掃門前雪，何貴國城門前，竟不自料理乎？」</p>
<p>「各人自掃門前雪，莫管他人瓦上霜，」道原是一句老話。嘗考其義，竊以爲可以有二個解釋。第一個解釋，自然是敎人休管閑賬，着重於這句話的後半段：「莫管他人瓦上霜」，此蓋是消極的解釋。筆者認爲除這個解釋外，還可以有一種積極的解釋，便是把這句話的重心移到上半段去；換言之，「各人自掃門前雪」，乃是敎人各自守住自己的崗位，各人去做自己所應做的事。</p>
<p>一般的人對於這一句平常的話，恐怕只是認識了下半段的意義，而忽略了上半段積極性的啓示。「莫管他人瓦上霜」，自然是無可非議的。他人瓦上的箱，本來與你何干呢？如果你一定要管，勢必踏破了人家屋子上的瓦片，於你又有何益？這種越俎代庖的結果，反而荒疏了本身的任務，脫離了應守的崗位，自已門前的雪反而無人負責了。</p>
<p>當前的時弊，據筆者個人看來，便是有些人並不在自掃門前的雪，却是撇去了自己的任務，而去干涉人家的事。或謂「莫管他人瓦上霜」者，乃是國人自私自利，缺乏社會意識的表現。殊不知人之盡職，把應辦的事辦妥了，這樣便可立致「國泰民安」之境，又何所用其「社會意識」呢？今日之所以需要「社會意識」者，無非是因爲社會上有一部份的人沒有盡職，沒有把自已應辦的事辦妥的緣故。</p>
<p>是故「各人自掃門前雪」倒不妨引來做各人的座右銘。如果反其道而行之，我來管你瓦上的霜，你來掃我門前的雪，結果不免是：霜固不能除，雪也未能淸，徒然增加了許多無謂的磨擦，不必要的糾紛。弄得不好，甚至還把自己瓦上的霜拋到人家的屋子上去，或是把自己門前的雪推到鄰居的門前去。但看社會上推諉責任互相責難的例子，眞是可謂舉不勝舉，觸目皆是。小則如個人與個人之間，大則如機關與機關之問，更擴而大之，如國家與國家之問，無處無這種「耘人之田」「越俎代庖」的情形。彼此之間，發生了爭執，總是說對方「實尸其咎」，事情決裂了，總是說對方一應負全責」。很少有自認不是的。就以軍備一事來說，國與國間總是責對方先行擴軍競賽，於是乎本國也不得不如此，聊以自衛。盍不姑且試一試一個相反的辦法：先把本國的武裝設備全行解除了，把軍隊人馬悉數遣散了，看看對方又將如何呢？據說英國的警察只備警棍，不持槍械，而英國的警察被暴徒擊斃的遠不如美國之多。於此可見「盜亦有道」，我們不必把人性儘往壞處猜看。</p>
<p>只派人家的不是，不見自己的失職，這些總只爲了一個「私」字。恕道之不行，未有甚於今日者——或曰似乎自始未見實行過。愚意：惟其自始未見實行過，故而令日愈有立即予以實行的必要。</p>
<h3>記性</h3>
<p>— 冷冷</p>
<p>美國最著名植物學家亞沙葛　能够記憶兩萬五千種植物的名字；凱撤也可以記憶他數萬心腹士兵的姓名。</p>
<p>英國名詩人拜倫會自誇過能背誦他所寫的全部詩句；但相反的，華爾特斯考脫的記憶力糟透，　竟會忘記他自己所寫的詩篇，他有一次曾把自己的作品錯認爲拜倫寫的，並加以熟烈的讚美。至於英國散文家及哲學家培根儘可默寫他自己一部最著名的作品至一字不錯；但像美國舞台明星約瑟夫賈弗森，雖然連演了十三年的「怕婆傳」，還是時常要忘記了劇中的對白。</p>
<p>却利卓別麟有一位七年不離其左右的私人書記，但最奇怪的，據這位書記吿訴別人，卓別麟還是不知道他姓甚麽呢！</p>
<p>埃及的摩罕默德大學可算得是世界第二最大的大學，該火學的慣例，每年新生入學試驗，必須背誦可　經全部。這部可蘭經幾與基督敎　新約一樣長，背誦一次，至少要費三天時間；但是每年有二萬多人都能毫無遺漏的背誦完畢，這種記憶力多麽驚人！</p>
<p>還是美國老羅斯福總統的記憶力也是値得稱頌的，他在接見賓客時，最歡喜注意他們的小節，面貌或舉動；他只要見過你一次；他就永遠不會再忘記你。無疑的，這對於他的政治活動有極大的帮助，常會收到意想不到的效力。有一次他和一位闊別已十五年的日本銀行家見面，最使日本銀行家驚奇不止的，他在一見面的剎那間，便大談其十五年前初次會見時所曾談過的一件事情。</p>
<h3>踏青偶感</h3>
<p>— 念鴻</p>
<p>風和日暖好天氣，雖然由於時間及金錢的限制，不能到汁麽名勝風景區去遊山玩水，總得往附近郊外去蹓躂蹓躂，蟄居亭子間慣了的，一旦看看田野曠地，阡陌丘溝，固比不上探梅登高的高雅有趣，但也已覺得興趣盎然，別有風味。至少在鄕村中見不到面目可憎言語無味的市儈之流，而質樸辛勤的農民，也自有其可愛之處。</p>
<p>我和鄉村接觸的機會極少，當然不知道他們生活的方式和內容究竟如何，幼時候嘗讀南宋范陸的詩句，從那種恬美的字句中，充滿了濃厚的香味，寫的是農民生活，樸質優美，對於厭倦了都市生活的人，富有極大的誘惑力，所以我年輕時對范成大的六十首四時田園雜興特別愛好，並且在幼弱的腦海中，幻想出一幅十分可愛的農家圖來，還抱着有機會長大後到鄕村裏去居住的理想。甚至因而特別喜食新鮮蔬菜，大有「朱門肉食無風味，只作尋常把菜供」的同好，又如放翁的名句：「棲鳥爭投樹，歸牛自識家。」范的「桑下春疏緣滿畦，菘心靑嫩芥台肥，溪頭洗擇店頭賣，日暮裏鹽沽酒歸。」「笑歌聲裏輕雷動，一夜連枷　到明」等佳句，更諷誦再三，偏愛尤甚。</p>
<p>但是後來年齒漸增，多看了些書，便對農村是否如此値得　往開始懷疑，偶然到鄕間去走了幾遭，感到自然的美是有的，「農家樂」，却未必盡然，即使范陸時代的南宋，也不一定見得如此優美。「宋史」食貨志中即云：「四民之中，惟農最苦…幸而收成，公私之債，交互爭奪，榖未登塲，帛禾下機，已非己有…」又「若値兇年，無榖可糶，賣田不售，遂致殺牛賣肉，伐桑　薪，來年生計，不暇復顧」。這種情形，就和范陸詩中大相逕庭了。再前一些，寫農民苦况的文字也很多，普通的如晁錯所謂「男子力耕，不足糧稼，女子紡績，不足衣服。」「貧民常衣牛馬之衣，食犬　之食。」更熟悉的如「樂歲終身苦，兇年不免於死亡」，也可見到數千年來中國農民生活的情况，恰巧和「春雨滿，秧新榖，閒日永，眠黄犢，看雲迎麥隴，雪堆蠶簇…」（辛棄疾詞）一番氣象完全相反。古時的情形如此，現代狀况只有惡化。「農村破達」「農村崩潰」之類的語句也時常聽見看到，最近報載內地糧官自殺的新聞，也可見乎一般農民己經像壓乾了的糠粃了。杜荀鶴曾有記寡婦的一首詩，給我的印象最深：「夫因兵死守蓬蒿，麻紵衣襟鬢髮焦，桑柘廢來猶納稅，田園荒後尙征苗，時挑野菜和根煮，旋折生柴帶葉燒。任爾深山更深處，也應無計避征徭。」又五代詩：「二月賣新絲，五月　新榖，醫得眼前瘡，剜却心頭肉。」更寫盡了農民的痛苦。今日的報草上，也可以常當讀到農民生活的通訊文章，慘况窘相，不忍卒讀。</p>
<p>當一個人原先的見解被後來的見解推翻否定時，對於第一個見解一定覺得錯誤而深痛惡絕。由於我幼時對范陸諸人詩句特別愛好，而當覺察受了他的欺騙時，便相反地格外厭惡這種士大夫們，他們祇憑了幻想和粗淺的觀察，便搖搖筆頭，寫些美啊美啊的詩句，戳穿以後，除了美麗的外殼外，就什麽也不値了！</p>
<p>旅行是最有益最能增廣見識的事，社會本身就是一本活的書，書中的知識，有待於讀者去發掘。如果不隨時留意，深入硏討，而祇是走馬看花，實在辜負了大好春光。際此春日，當泛舟湖心，步履絕峯的時節，除了讀嘆大自然的偉大美鹿外，想到划子脚夫農民漁翁生活的又有幾人？這也就無怪乎歌頌自然風花雪月的文章汗牛充棟了。</p>
<h3>天下之大</h3>
<p>— 樂</p>
<p>世界上最大的樂器是「阿普魯尼肯」（Apollonican），曾於一八一七年在倫敦展覽。這件樂器具有五套鍵盤，由五個人同時演奏，所發出的樂聲極爲繁複，竟如一個交響樂隊在演奏一般。</p>
<p>美國的無綫電傳影機現有二十九家公司積極製作，共六十一種不同的樣子，最小的一種可置桌上，備有面積四十方吋的銀幕，售價美金一百六十九元五角，最大的一種附有放映機設備，專供酒吧間，學校，旅備等處之用，銀幕面積十二方呎，價約美金三千元。</p>
<p>大英帝國的人口原有五億六千六百六十萬人，自過去二年間先後允許若千屬地獨立後，目前人口已減為一億四千五百七十萬人，與美國的總人口一億四千五百三十萬相差無幾。</p>
<h3>吉普車的誕生</h3>
<p>— 英民</p>
<p>馬歇爾自任參謀總長之後，日理萬機，許多有利於戰爭之發明，皆經專家審定後，經其作最後之決定。</p>
<p>有一次，參謀本部的施密司少校，推門進人馬帥的辦公室，看見裏面有幾位司令正與馬帥會談，施密司正想抽身退出，但馬帥說，「進來。」他中止會議，向施少校問：「甚麽事？」</p>
<p>施少校說外面有一位客人要會見馬將軍。這個人來到華盛頓已經幾個星期，他繪了一個小型汽車的圖樣，想供給政府作試驗。可是他見了許多人，大家對他的發明不感興趣，他在失望之餘，想親自見見參謀總長，作最後的申請。</p>
<p>施少校已與　人　　，也看過他的圖樣，他相信尙有研究試驗的價値，所以他說：</p>
<p>一將軍，我盼望你能見見這個人，他就在外面。</p>
<p>馬歇爾問了一兩個問題，然後說：「你仔細看過他的計劃嗎？」</p>
<p>「是的，將軍。」</p>
<p>「你的印象如何？」</p>
<p>「我看有點道理。」</p>
<p>「好吧，我同意，你定造一輛。」</p>
<p>「可是，將軍，試驗起來一輛是不够的，至少要十五輛。」</p>
<p>「施少校，你看我們能付這筆款子嗎？」</p>
<p>「可以的，大約一萬二千元。」</p>
<p>「好罷，那你就去辦吧。」</p>
<p>這就是聞名世界的「吉普車」的誕生，全部討論不過三分鐘。（譯自馬歇爾夫人所著的「同行」，是寫馬歇爾出使中國以前生活的一部傳記。）</p>

<p>第十二章　萍水姻緣　（九五）</p>
<p>綺紈見烏雲談話時，他那一雙眼睛，似含有吸力，一伸一縮，比任何男人都美。而烏雲却攱着如簧之舌，說得天花亂墜。綺紈一邊聽他說話，一　靜　他的優美的神光，一個人似墜入雲霧裏面，一直到聽差進來，吿訴島雲有電話找他說話，島雲才離開綺紈室內。綺紈在鬱極無聊中，給烏雲如此一說法，神思不由搖動，一個人躺在床上，靜靜想了一回，覺得鳥雲所說的話，不無道理，要找出路，當然到上海最好。島　在上海多年，一切情形熟悉，他說的話，當然可靠，一時又想鳥雲原來是一個富家子弟，無怪他言動舉止，那樣　灑大方。他說要組織影片公司，可見他的財力，很是充裕，這種人才，很是難得。看他語意對我很欽佩，一切言詞，都在　約之間，北平旣不能立足，渚齋不能結合，我何必自苦，我要自找川路才對，在前次爲了一時氣忿，要激刺渚齋，未加細察，結識繆處長，以至上了大當，鬧出笑話，現在爲避免和同業見面，祗有遠走高飛，最爲上策，眼前放了這樣一位漂亮人物，我不能不汴意。綺紈在室內，胡思亂想一陣，很想到鳥雲屋裏，再找他談談，又覺得不大方便，不如靜以待動，想他果然對我注意，一定會再來的。那天候到下午，鳥雲竟沒有照面，禁不住走到烏雲病室探問，島雲却沒在屋內，據看護說：劉先生上午有事出去，還沒回來。綺紈道：「劉先生患的什麼病？」看護道：「患的是痔瘡，現在已經好了，大概再有幾夭，就可以出院。」綺紈聽了，（便不言語，回到自己屋內，悶坐一會，總覺得心上似有一個問題沒解決，不由又走出屋外，在廊上徘徊了好久，看看夕陽已落，殘照掛在樹杪，幾隻寒鴉又　在枝上，啞啞的呌。綺紈一聽這鴉聲，好似什麼心緒，都勾了上來，痴痴倚在欄杆旁，望着樹上棲鴉發怔。過了一會，樹杪上殘光已漸漸匿跡，枝上的寒鴉，也一雙雙飛去，暮色已籠罩大地，綺紈仍痴立廊上發怔。正在此時，突有一人在她身旁，呌了一聲：「顧小姐！」</p>

<h3>上海與舊文化</h3>
<p>昨於琉璃廠書攤買得詒晉　巾箱帖一套，裝璜精雅，末册尾註「光緒庚辰上海點石齋印，申報館中昌書畫室發行。嘉慶丁卯金匱錢泳上石。」又見舊小說兩部，後註「申報館本」。友人日，北人但知申報爲老報館，刊行日報，孰知還有許多出版品。庚辰是淸光緒六年，至民國二十九年爲次　展，今爲三七年又閱八載，合計七十年前已有申昌書畫室之組織，其繼續川版之數量，若加統計，當已蔚爲大觀。</p>
<p>因思上海一隅，夙稱經濟中心，繁華世界，譽者比之以東方之倫敦紐約，毀者指爲　塲惡習，汚垢所業，此皆不須深論。獨關於文化方面，上海實有甚大之特殊貢獻，而爲一般所忽略。此事不可不一爲紀　。</p>
<p>上海之出版界，可分為「溫故」與「宜時」兩大類。「宜時」者，適應現代及當前之實用，而隨時展布，例如各大書局之針對新敎育之敎科儀器，供應各級學校之用品，以及社會各方面之「精神的食糧」。各大報館之編撰，印刷，營業，規模闊大，一切比內地早幾步。無論南京北京，文化人等孰不以上海爲取給之淵泉，此爲百年來共見之事實，無待申敍。至於「溫故」一方面，即是以新法拓印舊有之圖書碑帖版本字畫等，印製精而產量富，光輝國故，表彰前　，嘉惠後學，其豐功實效，非全國任何處所能及，即謂文化之車鎭，亦無不可。</p>
<p>昔賢有言，著書立說，固是學人所應有事，然著作不易，亦不能信其可傳，則莫如「刻書」，著意前人之佳作，廣共流傳，功在儒林，而已之名字亦附驥以彰。此論自極平實。但舊法刻書亦非輕而易舉，不若新法石印，鉛印，影印，珂罷版及新仿宋，聚珍各版之便利敏捷，而又精確美妙。是乃科學之賜，時代的恩惠，斷非舊時老先生們所能想像。</p>
<p>文化之發展，與印刷術之進步有密切而必要的關係。上海爲中西交通第一門戶，文明利器，自然有接受之優先權，江南人士舉事敏捷，多數有「幹」的精神，凡事見到便做，具此數優點（地理的，時代的，人事的），故舊有之綫裝書，老法刻本，或陳腐笨重，或秘密稀少者，被上海印刷界書業界一批一批的救活起來。點石齋，國光社，有正書局之碑帖字畫，掃業山房之各家筆記小說，印刷整齊淸楚，比舊木刻醒目，篇幅勻適，便於觀電，亦勝於舊本之「軟黯散漫」，參差不齊。其他各書館書局報社之具有良好印刷者，無不精印舊書，或搜求秘本孤本，使重見天日，公之於世人，或將習見之書而笨　費多者，加以整理，變爲物美價廉，皆是舊文化之功臣。</p>
<p>古老的舊京，從三四十年前起，書市貨品即以上海出版占種大多歡，新書固是多數，舊書（改印）亦是多數。如老「同文」老「鴻文」「廣百宋」之帶圖的舊小說，其字體之精　淸整，紙張之潔白純雅，圖繪之雅秀工麗，皆可當「心精力果」四字，在中國美術史上可占甚大之價値，而實得力於西法之印刷。前淸光宣時間，老「同文」繡像各小說，在北京市上已視同珍本，照古玩行市。近十年間雖新正廠甸大會，亦不見同文小說，偶有一二殘缺者亦索價奇昂，蓋已希世之珍矣。</p>
<p>近來大部木刻的綫裝書被論斤當廢紙買賣，（有的作包貨用，有的做造新紙原料。）論者以爲可惜，甚至代舊文化悲觀。雖有相當理由，但從實際勘察一番，則優勝劣敗，天然淘汰，亦屬無可逃避。以予自身所體驗者言之，家藏舊書，堆垜股架，滿目塵封，多年不動。因凡物貴乎得用，翻閱此等舊書，須用雙手搬取，放在桌上占去甚大面積，看了一面，並沒有多少內容，即須再翻一面，費時間又費手續，不及上海出版新式翻印之品（當然是「同文」，「掃葉」一類之本，而非一般薄紙小字密抄之劣製品。）淸楚便利，事半功倍。故當敵偽時期，因需款易米，將架上舊書賣出甚多。友人有勸阻或嘆惜者，予笑日：擱在架上亦是廢物。所檢存者十分之二，則有宋明版各一部，淸代大字板兩部，及少許精刻，重加整理，仍存架上，然亦只當古玩高拱，與文化並無何等關係。前讀老殘游記到東昌廟想觀楊府藏書不得（書中改「楊」爲「柳」姓，乃小說例舉），作詩有「深鎖瑯環飽蠧魚」之歎。然藏書之富如淸代內府，殿閣大庫，圖書充棟，長年封領，不但　魚蛛網，而且相傳爲狐仙蛇神之洞穴，即親貴大臣欲啓視一二，守者亦動色相告，幾與水滸傳首張天師山上鎭壓之妖魔一般。試問即使周秦漢魏，字大如斗，本大如船，與文化有何關係？我讀老殘游記，設身處地，假使我爲柳府，亦必拒絕老殘參觀，並吿以並非居奇自私，實因費半天　，鬧一身塵土，你也看不了幾篇幾頁，長不了多大學問，結果不過在游記上多幾句虛好看的門而　。</p>
<p>又如淸代「四庫全書」，徐世昌在總統任曾下明令派朱啓鈐專辦交某大書館承印，而未成事實。後來張學良亦有此議，亦算酷慕風雅，然而工煩費重，印亦難，賣也難，這都是瞎操心，無事自擾，還不如上海　書局，各報社，各印刷所，於不張皇不標榜中，把許多舊書印行全國，那却是實際有功於文化的做法。</p>

The situation of various parties requesting the handling of purchasing manufacturers' finished products has been disclosed one after another. In February of this year, the office received an order from the Chairman to draft a loan method for the 37th year of production undertakings and report it for approval. The office transferred it to various banks for comments and drafted five loan policies, which were submitted to the Council for approval and then signed and approved by the Chairman. It was also instructed that the Central Bank must still handle the rediscounting and re-mortgaging of general business loans of various banks carefully and must not be lax. The original policies are recorded as follows: (1) The 37th year production business loan policy and the National Bank of China should adopt the following methods: 1.

<h3>The Full Economic Council Discusses Prices and Adopts Stringent Measures to Suppress Inflation; Chen Qitian and Others Are Tasked to Draft Concrete Suggestions</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 11th] The Full Economic Council held its 36th regular meeting on the 11th, chaired by Wang Yunwu. First, Deputy Secretary-General Gu Yuchun reported and gave a detailed analysis of the price increase situation from January to the present. Gu said: Prices were relatively stable in January, but began to rise in the second week of February, and became more intense in the fourth week, led by rice and cotton yarn. The rising pattern has lost its normal state. The rising trend became more severe from March 3rd and is still continuing. After Gu's report, the committee members exchanged views on the price issue widely and discussed it enthusiastically. They generally believed that there were many reasons for the recent surge in prices, such as rumors and a large influx of funds from the Northeast, which were sufficient to stimulate prices, but the speculative manipulation of illegal merchants was also one of the biggest reasons. Most advocated taking strict measures to suppress the rising trend. It was generally determined that Chen Qitian, He Haoruo, Liu Zhendong, Huang Yuanbin, Deng Feihuang, and Bingwen, etc., should study methods and put forward concrete suggestions for discussion at the next meeting. Afterwards, the meeting discussed the Ministry of Agriculture's proposed plans for increasing the production of tung oil, silk, wool, and tea, four export materials, and decided to approve them in accordance with the review opinions. The original plan aimed at three years: (1) Tung oil: increase production to 60,000 tons in the first year, 80,000 tons in the second year, and 100,000 tons in the third year. (2) Silk: it is estimated to produce 65,000 dans of raw silk within three years, and 8 million yards of export silk. (3) Tea: it is planned to produce 1.2 million dans within three years. (4) Wool: it is hoped to produce 220 million pounds of coarse wool and 480 million pounds of fine wool annually. The review opinions were (1) the issue of establishing new institutions should be decided by the Executive Yuan. (2) The required funds should be coordinated with agricultural loans. (3) The establishment of factories should be negotiated with the Ministry of Economic Affairs. (4) The quality of agricultural products should be strictly examined. B. The Transportation Control Committee presented a case to the Full Economic Council for the China Trust Bureau to act as an agent for the government to purchase tung oil and pig bristles for export materials, and then collect a 1% handling fee for foreign exchange settlement and remittance to the national treasury. After discussion, the case was rejected for the following reasons: (1) The past regulations only had handling fees for agency services, and there was no distinction between agency sales and purchase handling fees. (2) All export expenses are reported and reimbursed as they are. The agency handling fee, according to past regulations, for tung oil and pig bristles alone, is 1.8 billion yuan. If the purchase handling fee is added, it will increase to 6 billion yuan. (3) In addition to tung oil and pig bristles, there are other export materials. If all of them require export handling fees, it will increase the treasury's expenses.</p>

Our reply stated: "The garrison in the Xinjiang Province of China has not crossed the border between China and Outer Mongolia at any time or at any place in the past." All the locations of the alleged invasion listed in the letter from the Government of Outer Mongolia are clearly within the territory of the Xinjiang Province of China. This is also what the Chinese government cannot but solemnly point out.</p>
<p>The reply continued: "Since June 6, 1947, when Mongolian troops invaded the northern foothills of Beitashan in Xinjiang Province, China, although the Chinese government has repeatedly protested and demanded that the Government of Outer Mongolia immediately withdraw the troops to Outer Mongolia, the Government of Outer Mongolia has not complied. Since the Mongolian troops invaded Xinjiang Province, China, they have not only caused heavy losses to the Chinese garrison in the Beitashan area, but also repeatedly carried out harassment and looting against the Chinese people residing in the counties of Yiwu, Zhenxi, and Dihua in the Hami area of Xinjiang Province, China, as well as Qhe, Fuyuan, Benleihe, and Fukang in the Dihua area."

Our country's land sovereignty and the survival of the people have been infringed upon, and world peace has been destroyed, which is almost all caused by this. Among them, the Soviet Union's forcible occupation of Lushun and Dalian shows its sinister intentions and has an impact that is detrimental to the overall situation in the Northeast, which is shared by everyone.

<h3>Marshall Announces to Readers That U.S. Policy Towards China Remains Unchanged 500 Million Worth of Supplies Can Be Fully Shipped to China by June</h3>
<p>[U.S. Information Service, Washington, 10th] Secretary of State Marshall stated in response to inquiries on the 10th that the U.S. policy towards China remains to seek a government with a broader foundation. Marshall said that President Truman had stated this point on December 18, 1945. According to this statement, all parties should work together to resolve their differences. Since that time, the U.S. has not issued any further policy statements on China. However, Marshall added that since the Communists have now openly rebelled against the government, the U.S. is not in a position to specify conditions, and the Chinese government should handle it. Marshall's remarks on China policy today were prompted by an inquiry from a reporter. According to the reporter, Congressman Fulton had said that the U.S. had never denied its original China policy, which was to promote a coalition government between the Kuomintang and the Communists. Marshall said that there had been a partial agreement in September 1945, but it was never implemented.</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 11th] Marshall stated at a press conference that the U.S. should adopt two different approaches to dealing with the challenges posed by the Communists in Europe and the Far East, but one point in common is that, whether in China or Europe, the U.S. is actively assisting governments fighting against the Communists.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 10th] Secretary of State Marshall recently stated at a press conference that by June 30th of this year, surplus supplies valued at an estimated $500 million can be fully transferred to China from the Pacific islands.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Washington, 10th] Officials say that the biggest difficulty in shipping goods to China is the slow pace of transportation within China. They pointed out that the freight for shipping surplus supplies from New Guinea to Wusongkou in Shanghai is 17 yuan per ton, but the cost of transporting it from Wusongkou to Shanghai is as high as 18 yuan per ton. They said that for this reason, the UN stopped shipping goods to China in 1946. However, it is generally believed that shipping difficulties have been reduced in recent months, so there is reason to believe that the Chinese government may be able to complete the transportation before the contract expires.</p>
<p>[U.S. Information Service, Washington, 10th] Approximately 16,200 long tons of rice and wheat will be shipped to China from the west coast and southern ports of the United States before the end of March, and cargo space has already been reserved on four ships. In addition, cargo space has also been reserved on the "Java" mail ship to transport approximately 500 long tons of grain seeds to China. The ship is scheduled to load cargo in Seattle on March 26th. This assistance is being handled by the China Aid Mission.</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Starting from the Suicide of the Czech Foreign Minister</h3>
<p>Less than half a month after the establishment of a communist regime through the coup in Czechoslovakia, Czech founding father Jan Masaryk, the foreign minister, tragically committed suicide by jumping from a building. The shocking news reverberated around the world, with universal mourning for Masaryk's death for freedom and democracy. The tragic end of a liberal who followed a center-left path is not only a great tragedy for Czechoslovakia, but also a major blow to the future of world peace and democracy!</p>
<p>In fact, after the formation of the Czech communist regime, we pointed out that the new Czech government was nothing more than a disguised one-party dictatorship, and we also anticipated that Czech tragedies would continue to emerge. The facts of the past ten days have proven the correctness of our views. First, there were rumors of President Beneš being forced to resign, and then there were the sweeping "purges" carried out by the Czech communists in the country, leaving the general public unable to breathe a breath of freedom. This time, Masaryk's suicide, sacrificing himself for the freedom and democracy of Czechoslovakia, not only exposed the disguise of the Czech communists' seizure of power, but also made us even more convinced that communism and democracy are two absolutely incompatible concepts. The expansion of communist forces in Eastern Europe and the rampant activities of the Chinese communist bandits in our country have made the freedom and democracy cherished by the world feel a very serious threat. Therefore, Secretary of State Marshall also called the Czech coup a "reign of terror" and warned the world that the overall world situation has reached a critical stage.</p>
<p>Of course, we also believe that the U.S. authorities have long been alerted to the threat of communist forces to world peace and democracy. The advocacy of the Truman Doctrine and the implementation of the Marshall Plan are sufficient to illustrate that the U.S. executive branch has long been planning to prevent problems before they arise. What is regrettable is the lack of thoroughness in advocacy and the lack of speed in action! As far as the Truman Doctrine is concerned, it has not yet been fully implemented in Europe, and there is no trace of it in Asia. Speaking of the Marshall Plan, it is still in the stage of congressional debate, and the total amount and the time of implementation are still unknown. But when we look at the current Europe, the division of the world is becoming increasingly clear. Although the London Conference has decided to merge the occupation zones of the three Western powers in Germany, and the representatives of the five countries of Britain, France, the Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg have drafted the Treaty of the Western European Union, these diplomatic activities, whether from a political, economic, military, or diplomatic point of view, are far less than the amazing developments within the red iron curtain. The Soviet-Romanian Mutual Assistance Treaty was signed on February 5th, followed by the signing of the Soviet-Hungarian Mutual Assistance Treaty on February 18th. After this coup in Czechoslovakia, the Czech communists took control of the government and completely threw themselves into the arms of the Soviet Union. Czechoslovakia is the heart of Europe: "Whoever controls Czechoslovakia controls the European continent." Recently, the Soviet Union forced Finland to conclude a military alliance treaty with it. Although it is still in the negotiation stage, Finland, in this situation, has no way to call for help, and probably has no other option but to accept the Soviet demands!</p>
<p>But the so-called Western European alliance is not a novel idea, but an old tune. At the beginning of the Second World War, the world was dreaming of the beautiful vision of "One World." Churchill delivered a speech in Fulton, USA, advocating the theory of the United States of Europe. At that time, the public opinion generally believed that Churchill's advocacy of this old-fashioned proposal seemed too backward and out of touch with the times. Even the U.S. diplomatic authorities held this seemingly "progressive" view. But when we think back to today, we can't help but admire Churchill's foresight. Although the Western European alliance has now become a reality, after two years of wasted time, its significance and role have also been lost by more than half. The U.S. authorities, who claim to lead the world's democratic forces, should reflect on themselves and quickly seek remedies!</p>
<p>From Europe, we return to Asia and observe the current policies of the United States. Whether it is towards Japan, Korea, or China, they have all made great historical mistakes. Especially Secretary of State Marshall's view of Chinese politics is not only a big mistake, but also a big failure! Marshall came to China to mediate the KMT-CPC negotiations, and he always believed that the CPC was an ordinary political party, and firmly advocated that our government should expand its foundation to include the CPC. Later, the negotiations failed, and Marshall left China unhappily. Now, after seeing the Czech coup and recalling the past negotiations, we can advise Marshall not to be unhappy anymore. Because even if the "coalition government" that Marshall advocated at that time was successful, who could guarantee that the CPC would not take similar measures as the Czech communists and stage a shocking "coup" to establish a totalitarian communist government to dominate China? If so, then Marshall would not only let down China, but also the United States, and all the people in the world who love democracy and freedom, and would have regrets for the rest of his life. However, according to the Associated Press, Marshall has not been enlightened by the Czech coup, and still advocates expanding the basis of the Chinese government, which makes us really do not understand where Marshall's brilliance lies. Although we do not want to say today that Marshall's mediation in China has indeed given the CPC the opportunity to expand its power, we cannot but point out that the U.S.'s lack of active support for China, especially the bias of the U.S. State Department's career diplomats towards the CPC, is one of the factors that have contributed to the expansion of the CPC's power.</p>
<p>Now, under the direction of Moscow, communist forces are invading both Europe and Asia. If the United States does not unite all democratic countries to stop them at the same time, the disaster will be unimaginable. Some people in the United States may still believe that the crisis in Europe is more serious than that in Asia, so they still advocate "Europe first, Asia second." In fact, this is also a view that only knows one thing but not the other. It must be known that if the United States cannot stop the expansion of communist forces in Asia, no matter how "all-out" it provides assistance in Europe, it will be difficult to reverse the situation. General Claire Chennault, the Flying Tiger, testified before the House of Representatives yesterday, stating his personal views on the issue of aid to China, and strongly emphasized the importance of military aid to China, saying that this move would help prevent Soviet aggression in Europe, otherwise a third world war would be inevitable. He also stated clearly: "I believe that the Soviet Union will not take any action in the West until China is completely red and can rest easy in the East. Therefore, once China is completely red, we will face an urgent problem and have to choose between participating in a third world war or retreating to the American continent. In my opinion, China is the cornerstone of world peace. If we concentrate all our energy and resources in Europe to prepare for the worst, we will make a big mistake." These words are full of true knowledge and insight, and we hope that the American government and public will take the Czech coup as a warning and think carefully!</p>

<h3>Northeast Petition Group Submits Document to Ministry of Foreign Affairs</h3>

(B) The government shall, within a , complete the anti-Japanese industry through diplomatic channels with the Soviet Union, in order to 共即之 to replenish the east, and benefit the military and gun transport. (C) Under the , implement the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, and when immediately returning Lushun and Dalian, please ask the government to act in accordance with the provisions of Article 1, Paragraph 2, Section 4 of the Charter of the United Nations (All Members shall refrain in their international relations from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any state, or in any other manner inconsistent with the purposes of the United Nations).

<h3>Reform of Northeast Currency Petition Group Puts Forward Opinions</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Office, 11th] Regarding the currency issue, the Northeast Petition Group originally scheduled to meet with Zhang Jia'ao on the evening of the 11th. However, because Zhang was summoned by the chairman at the last minute, they were unable to discuss it. They scheduled a meeting again for the morning of the 12th. It is reported that the opinions put forward by the petition group are roughly divided into three items: (A) Remittances, (B) Stipulating the exchange rate with the legal currency, (C) Circulation and use of the legal currency inside and outside the customs. Among them, regarding the issue of remittances, after the group raised it when meeting with Chairman Chiang, the chairman attached great importance to it and immediately approved the opening of remittances. The remaining two items still need to be confirmed, especially the determination of the exchange rate, which is extremely important. Because the army accounts for 70% of the holders and users of the currency, workers account for more than 20%, and local administrative personnel account for 10%, if the exchange rate is not fixed, it will have a great impact on military morale and industry in the future. Therefore, the petition group specifically raised these three points of opinion, which will ask Zhang Jiaji to pay attention to.</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper Nanjing, 11th Dispatch] The newspaper reports regarding the Sino-Hong Kong Agreement are not entirely consistent with the facts.

If the area after verifying the deed is less than 80% of the investigated area, in addition to selecting various types of land and spot-measuring the four corners and the center of each section, the names of the owners who have not paid for the review should also be investigated in detail. If there is a failure to review within the time limit, or concealment, omission, or short reporting, once verified, in addition to being fined two to five times the tax amount according to Article 21 of the Wartime Requisition of Goods Ordinance, it shall also be handled in accordance with the Regulations on the Punishment of Owners Who Limit Reporting, Short Reporting, or False Reporting of Land in the Land Registry.</p>
<p>(4) Public Announcement: After the field tax cleanup in the entire township (town) is completed, the registration and investigation team leader should, together with the baojia leader, convene a bao people's assembly in each bao to publicly announce the compiled results. After the public announcement of each bao is completed, the registration and investigation team leader should, together with the township (town) office, list and publicly announce it for one month. During the announcement period, if there are land disputes, the township (town) baojia leader should mediate with the registration and investigation team leader. If mediation fails, the parties should be instructed to file a lawsuit with the judicial authorities for legal handling.</p>
<p>(5) Re-investigation and Correction: During the public announcement period, if people believe that there are errors, omissions, or omissions, they may apply for re-investigation and correction. If necessary, staff may be dispatched to conduct on-site measurement. After correction, the private seals of the owner, bao leader, and the person in charge must be affixed to the correction area of the land register to show caution. If an error or omission in the compilation is discovered after the completion of the county-wide field tax cleanup work, the application for re-investigation and correction shall still be approved, and the correction method shall be handled in accordance with the Regulations on the Land Reporting Re-investigation and Correction.</p>
<p>(6) Compilation of Registers: After each field tax cleanup work is completed, the land registers shall be bound into volumes according to sections (land living registers), and then classified by household according to township (town), filling in the household registers (household plot registers), and filling in the grain levy roster based on this. In addition, three copies of the white deed and no-deed land registration registers shall be made, with one copy stored in the county (city) government, one copy submitted to the provincial government, and one copy submitted to the central government.</p>
<p>(7) Revision of Tax Rates: After the completion of the county-wide field tax cleanup work, the field tax rates should be revised according to the land category, land fertility, and output yield per mu. The maximum should not exceed nine rates, and the revision standard should be based on one-tenth of the income per mu of land.</p>
<p>Article 6: Ownerless land shall be reported by the township (town) office, and the income from the land shall be used for education and construction in the township (town) office, but the assessed tax amount shall also be paid by the township (town) office. If no one claims it after two years, it may be regarded as public property and recovered by the county (city) government. Article 7: After the county (city) revises the tax rates, if new land is discovered, causing the total tax amount of the entire county (city) to exceed the original tax amount, the various tax rates may be appropriately reduced, but not less than the original total tax amount. Article 8: The revised tax rates shall be jointly drafted by the county (city) government and the county (city) field grain agency, submitted to the county (city) council for discussion, and then submitted to the provincial government for review and forwarded to the Ministry of Finance, Ministry of Food, and Ministry of Land Administration for approval, and forwarded to the Executive Yuan for filing.

<h3>US Advocates Limiting Great Power Veto Power in the Security Council, Formally Proposes Recommendation to "Small Assembly"</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper News] New York 11th Broadcast: Lake Success News. The US delegation formally recommended to the "Small Assembly" today that the veto power of major powers in the Security Council should be limited. In September last year, Secretary of State Marshall stated that the United States would limit the use of the veto power to the most important issues, such as economic sanctions and the use of force, while the veto power may not need to apply to other secondary issues such as procedural issues. The recommendation made by the United States today is the solidification of this proposition. However, a spokesman for the US delegation admitted that the Soviet Union has not shown any signs of agreeing to this method. Furthermore, due to the Soviet Union's refusal to participate in the "Small Assembly," even if it is desired to raise this issue for discussion, it must be raised in the UN General Assembly, and then the Security Council must pass it, so there are many obstacles ahead. But the United States believes that this method is of such great significance that even if the attempt fails, it is worth trying. If the US recommendation is adopted, all the issues on which the Soviet Union has used its veto power in the past two years will be excluded from the scope of the veto power.</p>
<p>[United Press Philadelphia, 10th Dispatch] Philippine Ambassador Romulo spoke here tonight, opposing the establishment of a Supreme Security Council outside the UN organization. It is said that this group is a major threat to the UN, proving the inability to trust the organization to resolve disputes, and the international rift will expand, leaving no room for persuasion and compromise. Such claims should be completely dispelled, and the following measures should be taken to strengthen the powers of the UN organization: (1) Revise the UN Charter to make it a limited world government. (2) The UN General Assembly can currently only make recommendations to member states, but in the future, it should be reorganized into a true parliament with legislative power to prevent war. (3) The Security Council should become the executive body of the General Assembly, so that it is not bound by the veto power.</p>
<h3>US Attention to the Development of the Czech Situation; Secretary Marshall Acknowledges the Seriousness of the Situation; Condolences Extend from All Sides for the Death of Masaryk</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 10th] Secretary of State Marshall, in a reception for reporters today, stated that the global situation is "extremely serious," referring to the expansion of communist forces in Europe, the coup in Czechoslovakia, and the resulting agitation in the United States due to the various developments in Europe. Marshall also said, "The death of Czech Foreign Minister Masaryk is clear evidence that the communist rule in that country has created a world of terror. Whether Masaryk's death was a suicide, as the Czech government claims, is still unknown." Other U.S. officials believe it is likely that Masaryk was murdered. Reporters asked for an assessment of the overall situation, given the upcoming Italian parliamentary elections on April 18, where the Communist Party also has a chance to seize power, causing panic among various parties who fear the worst, with some even discussing the possibility of imminent war. Marshall replied, "There is indeed great anxiety about the development of the situation, and great agitation in the United States. The situation is extremely serious, and such emotional agitation is regrettable."</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 10th] Prime Minister Attlee, in a personal statement, expressed his shock at the death of Masaryk.

His name will forever be revered by those who believe in freedom. Foreign Secretary Bevin stated in the House of Commons that the names of Foreign Minister Masaryk and his father will forever remain in the cherished memories of the British people. Churchill, after recalling the shared hardships in London during the war, added that Masaryk's death is a great loss, but his glorious name will continue to be a guiding light for the Czech people.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Paris, 10th] Political figures believe that Masaryk's death is proof of the final collapse of freedom in Czechoslovakia, indicating an increasing need for Western countries to strengthen their unity.</p>

<h3>Britain Unwilling to Protest Soviet Interference in Other Countries' Internal Affairs</h3>
<p>Bevin Does Not Intend to Invoke the Anglo-Soviet Treaty</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 10th] Foreign Secretary Bevin, in the House of Commons, rejected the suggestion from Conservative MP Strauss that he invoke Article 5 of the Anglo-Soviet Treaty, which states that "the contracting parties shall strictly adhere to the principle of non-interference in the internal affairs of other states," to protest recent Soviet actions. Bevin pointed out that he had already criticized Soviet arbitrary actions in a speech in January, and did not wish to add any further comments.</p>
<h3>Czech Diplomats Resign En Masse</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Sydney, 10th] The Czech Consul-General in Sydney, Tokoly, announced his resignation this afternoon. He said that Masaryk's death was not a suicide but a murder.

<p>[Reuters, Oslo, 10th] The Czech Minister to Norway, Walter, announced his resignation tonight.</p>
<p>[United Press, Mexico City, 10th] The Foreign Ministry here announced that due to recent political developments in Czechoslovakia, the government has recalled its minister to Czechoslovakia for "consultations."</p>
<h3>Czech Representative Appeals, United Nations Refuses to Consider</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Lake Success, 10th] The Czech representative to the United Nations, Papanek, yesterday sent a letter to UN Secretary-General Trygve Lie, requesting that the Security Council investigate the situation in Czechoslovakia and that UN member states should decide whether to recognize the new Czech government. He accused Soviet officials of directly participating in the actions of the Czech Communist Party and accused Stalin of violating the Soviet-Czech Friendship Treaty. He further stated that since the coup, President Beneš has been unable to make public statements or appear in public places and has lost his freedom. The Communist Party is doing its best to destroy the democratic system in Czechoslovakia. Papanek also told reporters that he refused to recognize the new Czech regime, but did not wish to resign, as he considered himself still a public servant of the Czechoslovak Republic before February 20.</p>
<p>[United Press, Lake Success, 10th] Lie, after consulting with legal advisors and Security Council President Tsiang Tingfu today, decided to ignore the Czech representative's letter. It is said that this letter was not a formal appeal from the government, and could not be considered according to the rules of procedure of the Security Council.</p>
<h3>Significance of the Soviet-Finnish Treaty Lies in Closing the Door to Northern Europe</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Moscow, 10th] The Soviet semi-official publication "Soviet Literature Magazine" published an editorial stating that the Soviet-Finnish Treaty of Friendship, Cooperation, and Mutual Assistance will quickly close the door on Sweden, a partner of Wall Street, preventing their friends from across the Atlantic from entering the Soviet border. The enemies of the world are stirring up opposition to the Soviet-Finnish treaty in Northern Europe and making Stockholm the center of anti-Soviet activities. The Finnish people deeply know that the Soviet-Finnish treaty is a guarantee of independence and freedom, and a new investment in strengthening peace in Northern Europe and the world.</p>

<h3>US Senate Accelerates Discussion of European Aid Bill; Three Amendments Passed; Taylor's Motion Overruled by Majority Vote</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 10th, United Press] The US Senate has now passed three amendments related to the Marshall Plan for European aid and rejected an amendment to have the Marshall Plan administered by the United Nations. It has also scheduled two meetings for the night of the 13th, one of which is an emergency meeting, in order to make a decision on the Marshall Plan. Therefore, action on the plan should be completed within this week. The amendments passed by the Senate are (1) an amendment to cancel the provision to lease 300 postwar Liberty ships to 16 European countries; (2) an amendment to stipulate that the implementation of the plan should make as much use of private trade channels as possible; (3) an amendment to obtain assistance from Western countries in the European relief program. The amendment rejected by the Senate was proposed by Taylor, who was Wallace's running mate for Vice President. Republican presidential candidate Taft supports reducing the funding for the European Recovery Program from $5.3 billion to $4 billion, while Republican foreign policy spokesman Vandenberg calls for maintaining the original amount. The House of Representatives has abandoned the comprehensive foreign aid bill, including aid to Greece, China, and Turkey, and will instead discuss the European Recovery Program separately.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 11th] The Senate yesterday voted 73 to 3 against a proposal by Third Party vice-presidential candidate Senator Taylor to have a United Nations agency manage foreign aid.

<h3>Clementis Succeeds as Czech Foreign Minister; State Funeral for Deceased Foreign Minister Tomorrow; Gottwald States that Foreign Interference in Czech Internal Affairs Will Not Be Tolerated</h3>
<p>[United Press, Prague, 11th] Parliament today unanimously passed a vote of confidence in the cabinet led by Communist Prime Minister Gottwald.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Prague, 10th] The Czech Parliament held its first meeting since the coup today. Prime Minister Gottwald attended and delivered a speech lasting 55 minutes, strongly emphasizing that Czechoslovakia will not tolerate foreign interference in its internal affairs. He said that Czechoslovakia will continue to be a loyal and reliable member of the Slavic bloc and considers itself an ally of other countries that have already established people's democracy. However, Czechoslovakia will still strive to maintain good relations with all other countries on a reciprocal basis. Gottwald also announced that the new Czech constitution, which had not been drafted at the time of the coup, will be redrafted from scratch. The original plan was for the new constitution to be drafted before the general election in May.</p>
<p>[United Press, Prague, 10th] After Masaryk's suicide by jumping out of a window, Communist Clementis succeeded him as Foreign Minister on the 10th.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Prague, 10th] The state funeral for Czech Foreign Minister Masaryk is scheduled for Saturday of this week, with military honors. The funeral procession will pass through the city of Prague and go directly to Lány, where the tomb of the elder Masaryk is located. Lány will be renamed Masaryk Lány from that day on, in memory of these two great men. The Czech Parliament held its first meeting today since the establishment of the Communist-controlled government. Masaryk's seat was piled with red and white flowers. Interior Minister Nosek announced that Masaryk jumped from the window of his official residence at approximately 6:00 AM on the 10th, and his body was discovered half an hour later. Nosek also said that before committing suicide, Masaryk had read letters and telegrams from Western Europe and the United States, many of which approved of Masaryk's participation in the new government.</p>
<p>President Beneš is still at his villa in Ústí and has not returned. The news of Masaryk's tragic death was reported to the president by Interior Minister Nosek and Deputy Foreign Minister Clementis. Beneš's grief was, as expected, profound. Masaryk was not only his closest cabinet colleague but also the only remaining representative of Western thought in the country, a man he could rely on to restrain the policies of the new national front. Beneš's wife subsequently traveled by car to Prague to console Masaryk's sister, Alice. Prime Minister Gottwald also sent a special telegram of condolence to Alice. On Sunday, the 98th anniversary of his father's birth, Masaryk went to Lány, stood alone by his father's tomb, and meditated for a long time. On the 9th, he went to Ústí to see President Beneš, who was also a close friend and student of his father. At 6:00 PM, he received the Counselor of the Czech Embassy in London, Pless, at his official residence, and they talked for about an hour. Before parting, Masaryk instructed Pless to come again the next morning, as he had some letters to entrust to him to take to London. The last person to meet with Masaryk was his servant, at 8:30 PM on the 9th. On the morning of the 10th, Masaryk's guards found him lying stiff on the stone steps, having jumped from the bathroom window. His head was not injured, and his eyes were tightly closed, as if he were sleeping soundly. Masaryk lived frugally, and although his residence had five rooms, he only used two, one as a bedroom and sitting room, and one as a bathroom. The furniture in the sitting room was simple, like a student dormitory, not at all like the official residence of a foreign minister.</p>

<p>[Reuters, Brussels, 10th] According to reliable sources, the military part of the five-nation West European Alliance treaty will only apply to Europe, while the economic part will be extended to the overseas territories of all participating countries. Earlier reports that the alliance treaty would include provisions for extending mutual assistance to overseas territories have been denied today by the chief Belgian representative, Langehove. Langehove announced after this morning's meeting that the participating countries had reached a complete agreement in principle on all outstanding points of the alliance treaty. A British official spokesman also said that every key point in the treaty had been agreed upon, and that the remaining minor issues should not pose any difficulties. Before the start of this morning's five-nation conference, it was announced that the drafting committee had completed the final draft of the alliance treaty, but according to reliable sources, four articles were still missing from the full text of the treaty.

<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 10th] The United States supports the United Nations delegation to Korea in carrying out the Korean elections based on the recommendation of the UN Resident Commissioner.

<p>[United Press, Seoul, 11th] The United Nations Korean Commission spent the entire day of the 11th debating whether to implement the resolution of the Small Assembly to hold elections (at least in South Korea). Canada insisted that this move was illegal. The Philippines and France favored holding elections on May 9.

Representatives from the Philippines and France stated that since the Commission requested the opinion of the Small Assembly, it should accept its opinion without question. Philippine representative Arellano told United Press reporters that even after the establishment of the South Korean government, US troops should remain in South Korea, at least temporarily.</p>

<h3>Japanese Democratic Party Demands that the Ashida Cabinet Express Anti-Communist Stance</h3>

<p>[New Asia News Agency, Tokyo, 11th] New Finance Minister Kitamura Shinzo gave a speech on the 10th regarding the new financial policies of the Ashida Cabinet, stating: "The biggest cause of inflation is the lack of goods, so the future financial policy will prioritize production. Therefore, it is extremely important to introduce foreign capital, and issuing production-linked bonds is also a method, but it must be considered. Regarding the specific implementation of the three-party policy agreement, suspending the payment of interest on military bonds is a major issue. As for administrative reorganization, we intend to start by improving work efficiency. Also, reducing the tax burden on workers should fundamentally aim to enable workers to work as much as possible. As for the nationalization of the Bank of Japan, we intend to start by strengthening the independence of the Bank of Japan."</p>

For example, instead of rationing flour now, we plan to make it into bread and ration it.

<h3>Municipal Government Consults on Improving Employee Benefits</h3>
<p>To improve employee benefits, the Municipal Government, led by Secretary-General Shen Zonglian, convened an ad hoc meeting yesterday morning in the conference room, attended by bureau directors and heads of affiliated agencies. Ren Xianqun, Chairman of the Civil Food Allocation Committee, also participated. After the meeting, Secretary-General Shen informed reporters that the bureau heads agreed that it was indeed difficult for civil servants to maintain their livelihoods under the current high prices, and that they should petition the central government to restore the in-kind allocation of eight dou of rice. They also proposed a reasonable adjustment to the salaries of public educators starting in April. Furthermore, after the rice allocation was reduced to three dou in March, the Civil Food Allocation Committee planned to allocate additional rice at a subsidized price. The committee noted that the Municipal Government had more than 30,000 employees in total, a very large number, making the allocation extremely large and difficult to supply. However, for workers in the Public Works Bureau and sanitation workers and garbage truck drivers in the Health Bureau, who originally received four dou of rice but had it reduced to two dou, consideration could be given to allocating the two dou that were reduced at a subsidized price. Shen also stated that if each civil servant's family was counted as five people, one dan of rice would be needed per month, but only three dou were currently allocated, leaving a shortfall of seven dou. At market prices, this would cost 2.8 million yuan, but civil servants' average monthly income was only around 3 million yuan, making it practically impossible to maintain their livelihoods.</p>

Fortunately, the Fifth Regiment, Third Battalion, led by Battalion Commander Leng Yi, of the 12th Brigade of the 202nd Division of the Youth Army stationed in this city, sent troops to rescue the ship and lent an iron anchor for use, providing day and night protection, and the ship was saved.

<h3>Carrying Guns, Impersonating Military Police, Forcing Silver Shops to Exchange Jewelry; Extortion Scheme Leads to Arrest; Two of the Five Arrested Were Found to Have Committed Robberies</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] Ge Liangchen, a porter merchant residing at No. 3, Lane 166, Jiangning Road, specializes in traveling between Hong Kong, Taiwan, and Shanghai. Recently, in order to prepare goods to go to Taiwan, he was short of capital and borrowed a gold bracelet (weighing 9 qian 7 fen) and two gold rings (weighing 3 qian 4 fen) from his relative Le Xiangyun, the owner of the Xiangyun Silver Shop on Tiantong Road.</p>
<p>The next day, while Ge was planning to exchange the jewelry, an armed man named Zhang Zhipeng suddenly arrived, accompanied by three others, two in military uniforms and one in a Western suit, claiming to be police officers and wanting to detain Ge for the crime of privately operating gold jewelry. Ge was afraid and followed them to the Metropolitan Dance Hall, the New Great Cafe, and other places for negotiations. As a result, he reluctantly handed over the gold bracelet to Zhang and others. In the evening, they had a simple meal in a small restaurant at the intersection of Sanma Road and Yunnan Road. During the meal, Zhang and others suddenly took out guns and forced Ge to go to the Tianbao Silver Shop in Laoximen the next morning to exchange the jewelry. The group was preparing to defraud the silver shop at that time. Ge was forced to stay with them in Room 24 of the Pacific Hotel on Shaanxi North Road and could not return home. The next afternoon, Zhang escorted Ge to a teahouse at the predetermined location in Laoximen to meet with his three accomplices. Zhang immediately returned Ge's gold bracelet, and Ge exchanged it for 17.9 million yuan in legal tender at the Tianbao Silver Shop. Just as the transaction was taking place, two accomplices entered the shop impersonating economic police, insisting that they take Ge and the stolen goods to the police station together. After the silver shop staff gave them four gold rings, the group pretended to take Ge to the police station and left, getting into a car that had been waiting in front of the door. They drove to the side of the Ximen Memorial Tower, divided the loot, and scattered. After escaping, Ge reported the incident to the Detective Section of the Municipal Police Bureau.

Director Wu has instructed the Fourth Division of the bureau to draft measures to assist dance hall employees and hostesses in changing professions.</p>
<h3>Organized Draft-Dodging Ring Broken Up; Eight Workers from the Clothing Factory Enticed to Ningbo to Substitute for Military Service; Undercover Investigation Leads to Arrest of Five Suspects in a Small Hotel</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] Eight workers from the Shanghai Clothing Factory of the Joint Logistics Headquarters recently went missing. After a secret investigation by the factory authorities, it was discovered that they had been enticed and sold by an organized draft-dodging ring. They then collaborated with the Huangpu Police Precinct to continue the investigation, and finally arrested the ringleader, Xu Xiaomao, and four others. They confessed that the eight workers from the Clothing Factory had been sold to a certain place in Ningbo to substitute for military service. The factory has dispatched personnel to Ningbo to investigate, and has also reported the matter to the Joint Logistics Headquarters for record. According to Zhou Jiwen, the factory director, it is still under investigation whether this case is merely a simple matter of enticing and selling draftees or whether there is a larger conspiracy involved.</p>
<p>The Clothing Factory has more than six thousand male and female workers. Although the factory has been making every effort to improve worker welfare facilities, wages are lower than those of general factories due to headquarters regulations. Therefore, unscrupulous elements often exploit this weakness to instigate workers to leave the factory. After discovering the disappearance of eight workers a few days ago, the factory paid close attention to the matter. Director Zhou instructed the factory's inspection office to conduct an investigation. Yang Zhaoping, the deputy head of the investigation team,</p>
<p>disguised as workers, has been searching for clues in public places for several days. The afternoon before yesterday, at the Changle Teahouse on Fuzhou Road, they encountered a middle-aged man with a Ningbo accent who identified himself as Xu Xiaomao. He approached them and inquired about the factory's treatment of workers. Yang and others intentionally engaged with him and hinted that they were willing to be draftees. Xu then invited them to Rongfa Hotel, No. 11 Baoyu Lane, Dongxinqiao, to negotiate, stating that each person could receive a settlement fee of 16 million yuan, with an initial payment of 2 million yuan per person. They agreed to meet at the Qichang Hotel on Hankou Road at 9:00 a.m. the next morning. After Yang and others returned to the factory to report, Director Zhou specially dispatched plainclothes personnel</p>
<p>with guns to go with them the next day and contacted the Huangpu Police Precinct in charge. Yang and others went to the meeting in disguise and found that Xu was already waiting at the hotel with two assistants. They seemed to be wary of Yang and others. When Yang and others urged him to pay, he repeatedly made excuses and attempted to escape. Fearing that they would escape, Yang and others immediately arrested them. At that time, another accomplice came to deliver the money and was also arrested. Later, another accomplice was arrested. After interrogation by the Huangpu Police Bureau, they confessed to selling draftees. They also said that the eight missing workers had been sent to Ningbo. The Clothing Factory has reported the details of the incident to the Songhu Garrison Headquarters and has requested the Municipal Police Bureau to severely punish the suspects.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Gas Company Employee Grade Issues Resolved</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] The issue of adjusting the grades of workers and staff at the Shanghai Gas Company has been resolved after mediation by the Social Affairs Bureau. In order to promote labor-management cooperation and ensure the stability of employees' livelihoods, the management has formulated a table for adjusting the grades of staff and workers. In the future, employee wages will be handled in accordance with the provisions of the grade table. Employees will receive annual salary increases based on their years of service. Those who have worked at the factory for less than five years will be handled in accordance with company regulations. Those who have worked for five years but less than ten years will receive salary increases starting from the fifth year. Those who have worked for more than ten years will be calculated starting from the tenth year. This grading system will be implemented from July 1947.</p>
<h3>First Phase of Conscription This Year to Begin on April 1st; Failure to Report on Time Will Result in Compulsory Enforcement</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] The implementation measures for conscription in this city in 1948 were approved by the Civil Affairs Bureau yesterday and will be submitted to the Conscription Association for approval and then promulgated. Here is a preview: (1) The first phase of conscription in this city this year will be carried out in accordance with the Conscription Implementation Law and the Conscription Implementation Guidelines for 1948 promulgated by the National Government, as well as the resolutions of the Conscription Association and the City Council, and the implementation measures for conscription in this city this year (referred to as "these measures") are formulated. (2) The quota for the first phase of conscription this year is based on the current allotment of 6,000 men, which will be allocated to each district based on the proportion of eligible men in active service, and then further allocated to each ward (the quota table will be issued separately). (3) The first phase of conscription this year will be based on formal conscription. If there are eligible men in active service in each district and ward who volunteer to enlist, they should submit a written application for voluntary service in accordance with the volunteer conscription measures for 1947, and obtain a guarantor. The conditions are as follows: (1) Must have a household registration in this city. (?) Must be between 20 and 25 years old. (3) Must have pure ideology and a physique that meets the prescribed standards. Refugees returning from bandit areas may be exempted from conscription before formal registration.</p>
<p>Conscription to Start from Age 20 (4) The first phase of conscription this year will start with one year group of men who are 20 years old (born in 1927), and will be conscripted sequentially. If the quota is not met, the age groups will be gradually extended until the quota is met, but it must not exceed three year groups (i.e., those born in 1925, 1926, and 1927). (5) The first phase of conscription in this city will begin on April 1st. The Civil Affairs Bureau will fill out the conscription notices based on the lottery numbers and notify the district chiefs, who also serve as conscription officers, to send personnel to collect and distribute them. If eligible men in active service who have been drawn fail to report on time, the district chiefs, who also serve as conscription officers, may report to the municipal government for compulsory enforcement. The quotas for each district in this city must be fully met by the end of June. (6) The procedures for conscripting and sending eligible men in active service (volunteers) in each district and ward will still be carried out in accordance with the volunteer conscription and sending procedures for 1947.</p>
<p>Elimination of Those Who Fail to Meet the Requirements (7) In addition to the physical examination committee organized by the Conscription Association, personnel from the Shanghai Garrison District Command will also be invited to participate in the examination of conscripted eligible men in active service. Those who fail the examination will be eliminated, and replacements will be made in the order of lottery numbers. (8) When conscripted eligible men in active service (volunteers) from each district and ward in this city are transferred to the new recruits' brigade, a handover supervision committee will be organized by the Conscription Association to supervise the handover. (9) The settlement subsidies and慰勞物品 for conscripted eligible men in active service (volunteers) when they are transferred to the National Defense Forces will be handled by the Conscription Association in a unified manner, and the specific measures will be determined separately. (10) If there are any omissions, missed lottery draws, or evasion of military service among eligible men in active service in each district and ward, they will be allowed to be conscripted and sent first. (11) If there are any matters not covered in these measures, they will be handled by separate orders. (12) These measures will be implemented after being passed and promulgated by the municipal government in conjunction with the Conscription Association, and will be sent to the Ministry of National Defense and the Shanghai Garrison District Command for record.</p>
<h3>Lottery Committee to be Established the Day After Tomorrow</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] The lottery committee under the Conscription Association, which was originally scheduled to be established on the afternoon of the 15th, has been advanced to 10:00 a.m. on the 14th at the association due to the urgent need to start the lottery work. This change of date notice was issued last night. All committee members, district chiefs, and district representatives will participate at that time. In addition, the association's propaganda committee is scheduled to hold a propaganda meeting at the Queen's Theater at 2:00 p.m. on the 15th, with a large number of novel propaganda materials to be distributed at the meeting.</p>
<h3>Insufficient Rice in Warehouses Affecting People's Food Supply; People's Livelihood Investigation Committee Orders Rice Merchants to Transport 40,000 石 of Rice Daily; Police to Supervise Rice Distribution at Warehouses</h3>
<p>Ren Xianqun, Chairman of the People's Livelihood Investigation Committee, convened a meeting of 268 rice merchants in the city at Nanshi Market last night, strictly ordering the rice merchants to transport 40,000 石 of allocated rice daily to the rice shops in each district, so that the 1,935 rice shops, social service branches, and cooperative societies in each district can universally sell the allocated rice. The rice merchants reported that the only difficulty was that the rice distribution warehouses, such as the Taikoo Warehouse, open at 9:00 a.m. and close at 11:30 a.m., reopen at 2:00 p.m. and stop at 4:30 p.m., only working five hours a day and closed on Sundays. The China Trust Bureau warehouse supervisors only allow two weighing scales to be opened each day, and only over 7,000 bags of rice were distributed yesterday. Especially since the Taikoo Warehouse must be supervised by customs officers, even if the Taikoo Warehouse and China Trust Bureau warehouse supervisors are willing to extend their working hours, the customs officers must leave work at the designated time. Therefore, Chairman Ren decided to notify the Police Bureau Director to send police to supervise the warehouses this afternoon and to prevent them from stopping work at 11:30 a.m. and 4:30 p.m. They should take shifts, and those who violate this will be sent to the Huangpu Branch Bureau for legal action. In addition, the First Warehouse, East Warehouse, Guanlu Warehouse, Public Welfare Warehouse, and the number of coolies in the Xiaogong Warehouse of the China Trust Bureau all have vacancies. Chairman Ren promised to thoroughly investigate this and promised to open the Wing On Warehouse. The originally scheduled suspension of rice distribution at the First Warehouse has also been decided to be stopped, and it must continue to distribute rice. As for the Grain General Warehouse, in addition to the 88,000 石 already distributed, another 82,000 石 can also be quickly distributed. The meeting did not end until late at night. Chairman Ren told a Central News Agency reporter that if the warehouses, such as the Taikoo Warehouse, delay the distribution of rice again, they will be sent to the Special Criminal Court and punished for disrupting the economy.</p>

<h3>The Prodigy Calligrapher and Painter, Liu Boshu</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Nanchang, Ninth of the Month, by Air] A thirteen-year-old child who has just completed elementary school and entered the first grade of junior high school can paint large, free-spirited horses and roosters. He is a rare "prodigy" in Jiangxi, and perhaps can be called a young painter in the current Chinese art scene. This child's name is Liu Boshu, a native of Yongxin, Jiangxi. He is a top student at the Jiangxi Provincial Experimental Primary School. His father, Liu Zhongmou, teaches at the "Experimental Primary School." His mother is a genuine Yongxin country girl, hardworking and thrifty, assisting his father in managing the household. The family of eight relies entirely on Liu Zhongmou's teaching income to support their lives and raise five children. Boshu and his older brother are in middle school, and two younger brothers are studying at the "Experimental Primary School." The youngest, a little sister of only one year old, is held in his mother's arms day and night.</p>
<p>The First Signs of Genius</p>
<p>The young painter Liu Boshu can not only paint but also boldly paint spirited, high-headed horses on five-foot rice paper. Whether he is a genius or simply able to concentrate on practicing sketching is debatable. It turns out that when he was six years old and not yet in school, he lived with his parents at the school. Seeing the children attending classes, reading, and living their school lives, he was already immersed in education. So, in his childhood, he liked to use tiles and chalk to scribble on the ground or walls. Sometimes he would draw a vase with flowers, or chicks flying and jumping, and horses running. During the war, he and his father returned to Yongxin from Anfu Junma, which gave him more opportunities to understand the posture of horses and increase his wisdom in painting horses.</p>
<p>Painting Competition His debut work – a horse – was first valued and appreciated by outsiders when he was ten years old. At that time, he was studying at the Attached Primary School of the Yongxin Women's Normal School and participated in the Attached Primary School art exhibition, where he "became an instant success," winning first place among all the exhibits. After the victory and repatriation two years ago, he returned to the "Experimental Primary School" in Nanchang with his parents and participated in the Nanchang student painting competition, winning first place in the primary school group. The reputation of "young painter" was established in these two art exhibitions, and at the same time, it was no less than an invigorating stimulant to encourage him to improve.</p>
<p>Seeking Advice from the Master</p>
<p>He once sent four horses in different poses to Professor Xu Beihong, the master painter of horses in China, who was hosting the China Academy of Art in Beiping, to seek his advice.</p>
<p>Spiritual Disciple</p>
<p>The master painter Xu Beihong was overjoyed to receive such a talented student from afar. He immediately wrote back, saying: "The best way to learn painting is to 'take nature as your teacher.' When painting horses, you must take horses as your teacher, and when painting chickens, you must take chickens as your teacher. Carefully observe their appearance, movements, and expressions, and strive to grasp the essentials, without dwelling on trivial details." Xu taught him: To paint horses, you must also be familiar with the horse's skeleton, muscles, and tissues, and even learn horse anatomy. He hoped that the young painter would be determined to become a world-class artist and not be complacent with minor successes. Now, Liu Boshu is already Master Xu's "spiritual disciple."</p>
<p>Selling Paintings to Buy Books</p>
<p>Last May, he saw two painting albums by Master Xu at the Nanchang Zhonghua Bookstore but did not have the money to buy them. Later, he discussed it with the manager of the bookstore, who agreed to put several of his works on sale in the bookstore to use the proceeds to pay for the albums. The young painter's family economics can be seen from this. After getting Xu's albums, he worked harder to copy them, and added a "Learning from Beihong" seal under his signature. According to friends in the art world, his recent works since consulting the painting albums have indeed made great progress, especially after Master Xu gave him guidance and instruction in a letter, he can better control the paper and ink and write more wonderful works.</p>
<p>Holding an Exhibition</p>
<p>Recently, he held a solo exhibition in Nanchang, which caused a sensation in Hongdu. Within three days, more than twenty of his works were sold, earning nearly ten million in painting fees. On the last day, several foreign friends saw him painting in public and praised him greatly. Even two non-sale items displayed at the art exhibition were purchased.</p>
<p>Liu Boshu's achievements today are due to his talent, but also to the guidance and equipment of the school. It is necessary to introduce the Jiangxi Provincial Experimental Primary School, where the young painter was born and studied.</p>
<p>Overview of the Alma Mater</p>
<p>The "Experimental Primary School" was founded more than forty years ago and is now headed by Principal Liu Weiyou. Although it has been relocated several times during the war, it has never interrupted students' classes. There are now 1,200 winter students gathered in an old-style folk house building to study and play together. No fewer than 50,000 students have graduated from the "Experimental Primary School" and gone on to study in higher education or abroad. Dr. Mei Ru'ao, who is sitting on the judicial throne at the Far East Court, trying Japanese war criminals, completed his primary school education at the "Experimental Primary School" when he was a child.</p>
<p>The school not only has a library but also a well-equipped art classroom. When the children are taking art classes, they can freely draw and paint. Everyone hangs their works on the walls for a competition. Now, another child's sketch painting has also achieved considerable results. More than a thousand children in the school are all happy to study, seeing the young painter's achievements today.</p>
<p>White-Haired Teacher</p>
<p>Han Zude, an old teacher at the "Experimental Primary School," has worked at the school for forty years and is now sixty-eight years old. His hair is already white. Two years ago, he won a first-class certificate from the Ministry of Education. Now his spirit is very strong, like a young man. This old teacher repeatedly praised the young painter's past achievements at the "Experimental Primary School." He said: The child has excellent character and academic performance in school. He always gets excellent grades in exams and has the virtues of loving quiet and enjoying research. (Our Reporter Liu Zao)</p>

<h3>Bandits in Huangyan Take Advantage of the Situation to Riot and Loot Guns from the Town Office</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Huangyan, Seventh of the Month] Since the conscription of men in Yangfu Temple in the county on the 25th of last month, the people have been in turmoil, and bandits in various villages have taken the opportunity to riot. At about 9:00 a.m. on the 3rd of this month, five or sixty bandits suddenly appeared in Shiqu Street, Luqiao, Hu Zhen, Southeast Township, Huangyan County. They were all in plainclothes and mixed into the Shiqu Street market. They looted more than a dozen guns from the town office and wounded two members of the town security team. They then attacked Luqiao, but because Luqiao was already on alert, they fled towards Shijia'ao and went to Huangmao Mountain.</p>
<h3>All Counties in Jiangsu Province Required to Complete Conscription of 60,000 Men by the End of This Month</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Zhenjiang, Eleventh of the Month] The Jiangsu Garrison Command recently telegraphed all county and municipal governments, ordering them to instruct their subordinates to share the difficulties, overcome all obstacles, and complete the conscription of all 60,000 men for this year by the end of this month to enrich the source of soldiers.</p>
<h3>The Artery of the Country; Guangzhou-Hankou Railway; Equipment is Actively Improved; American Loans Accelerate Transportation Construction</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Guangzhou, Eighth of the Month, by Air] With the flames of war spreading across North China and calls for construction in South China growing louder, the Guangzhou-Hankou Railway, which undoubtedly connects the north-south transportation arteries, is most worthy of attention. Especially since the United States announced that it would allocate 60 million US dollars in loans specifically for improving the equipment of the Guangzhou-Hankou Railway, its importance has become even more prominent. The Guangzhou-Hankou Railway is 1,106 kilometers long. After the victory, the central government ordered that the entire line be reopened to traffic within eight months. Although it was able to be completed on schedule, it was still crude due to limited equipment and funding. Therefore, for more than two years after the victory, the number of accidents has made travelers wary. In particular, the horrific train overturning accident at the Yingde Bridge on July 10 last year, in which floating corpses filled the river, still makes people "change color at the mention of trains." Recently, bandits have emerged along the line to harass, attack trains, and destroy tracks, so the efficiency of trains has been greatly reduced. In order to ensure the transportation between Central China and South China, the authorities had already decided to overhaul it, and the arrival of American loans is like injecting a cardiotonic drug into the anemic Guangzhou-Hankou Railway.</p>
<p>According to the Guangzhou-Hankou Railway authorities, the Guangzhou-Hankou Railway must undergo major reforms within this year. At present, the railway only has more than 160 locomotives, of which only 100 are usable, more than 1,400 freight cars, and more than 300 passenger cars. However, the entire line (including the branch lines Guangzhou-Kowloon and Guangzhou-Sanshui) operates more than 30 trains every day. Combined with management and technical problems, there is a great shortage of carriages. It is common for passengers to wait five to seven days to buy tickets. Since the restoration, no new carriages have been purchased, and the existing carriages are uneven, with hooks of different heights, which has caused the main cause of accidents. After Director Song Ziwen took office, he deeply felt that the smooth flow of traffic on the railway had a great impact, so the first step was to immediately ask the Ministry of Communications to allocate 100 freight cars from the Jiaoji Railway that were out of service and transport them by waterway. They will arrive soon. At the same time, 20 Australian locomotives allocated by the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration are expected to arrive and be used within this year, so the transportation volume can be greatly increased. Du Zhenyuan, Director of the Guangzhou-Hankou Railway Bureau, also said: Since many vehicles in the north have been suspended from use, while the Guangzhou-Hankou Railway urgently needs vehicles, if 100 passenger cars and 200 covered wagons can be allocated to the south, the railway's transportation can be guaranteed to reach the ideal target.</p>
<p>As for the problem of improving the bridges along the entire line, according to Director Du, the railway is</p>
<h3>Wuxi Launches Spring剿 Suppression Campaign and Offers Rewards for the Arrest of Bandit Leaders Zhang Zhuoru, etc.</h3>
<p>[Report from our Wuxi Office on the 10th] The County Government, due to the frequent presence of remnant bandits in northern Wuxi, has specially arranged a spring suppression plan, aiming to eradicate them completely. It also ordered the traitorous bandits to surrender, promising them protection. The main points of the announcement are as follows: (1) Rewards are offered for the arrest of bandit leaders Zhang Zhuoru, Xue Yonghui, Jiang Hua, Miao Nansheng, Lu Daonan, and twenty others. (2) Communist bandits and accomplices within the county are granted an extended period to surrender until the 20th of this month. Those who fail to surrender by the deadline will be arrested and severely punished according to the law. (3) Residents within the county who have relatives, friends, or teacher-student relationships with the aforementioned wanted bandit leaders are required to register with their respective township offices before the 20th of this month. The government will provide them with protection. The County Government also convened a suppression meeting, deciding to launch a comprehensive spring suppression campaign to maintain social order.</p>
<p>Bridge Improvement</p>
<p>To prevent the recurrence of tragedies, maximum effort has been expended to purchase a large quantity of steel beams from the United States, Britain, and Canada, with the intention of replacing all wooden bridges by the end of October this year. The replacement on the southern section of the Yuehan Railway has already been completed. Approximately one million railway sleepers are needed. Apart from purchasing 200,000 from within the country, the remainder will be imported from Siam. However, the major task of railway improvement – the replacement of rails – will have to await American aid.</p>
<p>Although the allocation of American loans is still in the "staircase" stage, the transportation authorities are already planning with an open mind on how to truly improve the Yuehan Railway. According to Deputy Director of the Aolu Railway, Lin Shibo, at least US$40 million is needed to restore the Yuehan Railway to its pre-war condition. Therefore, the successful securing of a US$60 million loan will essentially solve the "only lacking the east wind" problem for the Yuehan Railway. While the authorities have not yet formally announced how they intend to utilize this batch of loans, from the snippets released by the authorities and Director Du Zhenyuan's statements, it can be inferred that, aside from some technical details, the main focus will be on the following:</p>
<p>Developing New Lines</p>
<p>The coal transport line from Zhuzhou, Hunan to Xinghua and Gouyadong in northern Guangdong is the fuel source for the Yuehan Railway. According to unofficial estimates, the coal reserves in Gouyadong alone are sufficient to supply the entire railway for over forty years. However, limited transportation has prevented mining and transport. To solve the entire railway's power needs, the construction of this line is naturally a priority. It is reported that the Ministry of Communications is actively planning its construction, using the old rails after new rails are installed on the Yuehan Railway. It is expected to be completed next year. The next priority is the construction of the Shaoguan branch line (from Shaoguan through Shixing, Nanji, Ganxian, Taihe, Ji'an to Qingjiang), which will connect with the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway. With a total length of 260 kilometers, once completed, the entire southeast region, and even the southwest border areas, will be connected, greatly facilitating the exchange of materials and military transportation. Its importance is self-evident. Therefore, Chairman Soong Tzu-wen, after returning to Guangzhou from his work report in Nanjing, specifically emphasized that the construction of the Shaoguan-Ganxian line must be expedited. Once American aid arrives, it can likely be implemented immediately. Other lines include the Shantou-Xiamen line (via Xingning) of about 600 kilometers, and the Guangzhou-Macau branch line, which will also depend on American aid for construction. (It is learned that a Belgian company, which previously invested in the construction of the Pinghan and Longhai railways, sent personnel to negotiate the construction of the Shantou-Xiamen line, but negotiations failed due to technical issues and the project was shelved.) With the completion of these four branch lines, the South China railway network will be almost complete, and the importance of the Yuehan Railway will continue to increase.</p>
<p>Laying New Rails</p>
<p>Due to the destruction of the war and the desire for post-war reconstruction, the equipment of the Yuehan Railway is simply below standard. In particular, the rails, pieced together and dilapidated, have been deemed unusable by American engineers for 547 kilometers. Moreover, there are more than twenty types of steel rails, creating disparities that are enough to hinder operations. Therefore, the Railway Bureau has decided to replace the rails with new ones as soon as the loan arrives. Regarding steel beams, the entire line originally had over 500 steel beam spans. The existing steel beams have been pieced together to form beams, and over 300 spans have already been replaced. It is expected that all can be replaced by the end of May. For the construction of the future Shaoguan-Ganxian branch line, it has been decided to purchase new-style steel beams and equipment with American loan funds. It is likely to be much better than the current facilities.</p>
<p>Establishing</p>
<p>Subsidiary Factories</p>
<p>Almost all the equipment for the Yuehan Railway is purchased from abroad, resulting in significant annual losses. To remedy this, the authorities have long planned to establish large-scale machinery factories in Guangzhou and Hengyang to specialize in producing and repairing equipment needed for the entire railway. However, these plans were delayed due to funding problems. (Although there were several negotiations for foreign loans and attempts by foreigners to invest, none materialized.) It is now reported that US$4 million from the loan will be used to construct a large-scale machinery factory in Xicun, Guangzhou, and the Ministry of Communications will allocate some mechanical equipment. In addition, a large locomotive factory will be built in Hengyang, preparing to manufacture locomotives and all accessories. Furthermore, it will cooperate with the Resources Committee to operate the Gouyadong and Zhuzhou coal mines to solve the fuel problem.</p>
<p>The specific decisions for the entire plan are still pending Director Du Zhenyuan's discussions with the transportation authorities in Nanjing. However, everyone seems to have the confidence that "Even if American aid does not come, in order to ensure the smooth operation of this major artery of China, although it will be more difficult, we will still have a plan and do it better!"

<h3>Zhang Zhizhong Plans to Organize a Symphony Orchestra in Lanzhou - Establishment Costs at Least 2 Billion Yuan</h3>
<p>[Report from our Lanzhou office on the 11th] Zhang Zhizhong recently plans to initiate the organization of a large-scale symphony orchestra and has instructed renowned tenor Wu Yue to draft a specific plan. It is said that talent will be recruited from the southeast, and the establishment costs will be at least 2 billion yuan. After its establishment, it will tour various locations in the northwest.</p>
<h3>Pinghu Jin Sinian Bridge Once Experienced a Scare</h3>
<p>[Report from our Pinghu office on the 10th] At noon on the 9th, a patrol sailboat of the Zhejiang Water Police was engaged in smuggling on the Jin Sinian Bridge waters. Due to mechanical failures, it docked for repairs. The local garrison self-defense force suspected it was a treacherous bandit from the sea taking the opportunity to cause trouble. The patrol officer, unaware of the situation, urgently reported to the county magistrate. The town was once tense around 3 PM. It was later learned that it was a misunderstanding, but it had already caused a scare.</p>
<h3>Sufficient Troops and Food to Strengthen the Suppression of the Rebellion: Fujian Organizes Team Police to Cultivate Land</h3>
<p>[Airmail report from our Fuzhou office on the 9th] The Fujian Provincial Security Authorities recently decided to implement a security team police land cultivation system to cooperate with the national policy of suppressing the rebellion and establish a foundation of sufficient food and troops. Currently, each county and city government is investigating the following three types of land within its jurisdiction: (1) Local public property that has been cleared and lacks tenants; (2) Public wasteland that has not been claimed; (3) Private wasteland whose owners have lost contact, resulting in no one cultivating or being able to cultivate it. The county and city governments will then coordinate with the local team police and landowners or their agents to sign lease agreements and cultivate the land. However, this work should not interfere with the original duties of the team police. It is planned that each company or platoon will be a production unit, with each team police officer occupying five fen of farmland in principle. All income will be used exclusively for the welfare of officers and soldiers of each unit. It is believed that after this work is completed, not only will the funding for the security teams in each county be supplemented, but also military discipline and border security can be improved.</p>

<h3>Soldiers Intercept Firewood Boats to Longtoushui Without Reaching Changzhou</h3>
<p>[Report from our Wujin office on the 9th] Firewood is scarce in this county recently. Mountain firewood costs 200,000 yuan per load and is still difficult to purchase. The reason is that firewood carriers or boats from rural areas are intercepted by soldiers in the suburbs, who forcibly buy the firewood at low prices. The firewood sellers suffer greatly. Over time, the firewood sellers all hide their goods, and the firewood supply in the city is cut off. Residents are very alarmed. The city defense meeting on the 9th specifically discussed this issue seriously. The firewood industry also issued an appeal, asking the government for assistance. The opinions of all parties advocate severely cracking down on wandering soldiers who intercept, purchase, and resell firewood. The amount of firewood needed by the troops should be supplied by the government in accordance with the evaluation of non-staple food, to avoid disturbances. However, the necessary funding is quite large, and the county government is currently struggling with this.</p>

<h3>Old Oxford University Installs New Atomic Fission Machine</h3>
<p>[British News Agency, London, 11th] A new atomic fission machine for research purposes was installed yesterday at Oxford University. The machine, which is quite different from the ordinary type, is named "Betatron" and was donated to the university by the British Samson Horton Company. Its method of generating electrons and its power are far stronger than the machines currently available at Oxford University. It is said that this high-efficiency power will have great value in the treatment of diseases. The extra power is obtained by accelerating the flow of electrons in a ring-shaped hollow tube, which is under vacuum and only one inch in diameter, smaller than the usual type. The miniaturization is a great technical achievement, as the electricity circulates in this small tube one million times without touching the edges. The electron journey is equivalent to traveling 10,000 miles. The machine was completed in May of last year and has since been used by a team of experts from Oxford University assisted by the designers. The research is led by scientist Duke, who spent two and a half years working on the secret atomic bomb experiments at Los Alamos during the war.</p>

<p>[Report from this newspaper] In the Basketball Group A League, Donghua defeated Yizhong 36-32 in Group A2B last night, securing the championship. In Group A1, Renyu defeated Chenyou 52-49, and in a Group A1 makeup game, Encas defeated Qingbai 46-41. After the game, several spectators in the stadium approached the referee, accused him, and assaulted him. The Basketball Association is currently investigating. Details of yesterday's games are as follows:</p>
<p>Donghua Beats Yizhong</p>
<p>Donghua of Group A2B is invincible, and last night they defeated Yizhong 36-32. In the first half, both sides focused on defense, 15-8. In the second half, 21-24, Yizhong's strength can also be seen. Now Donghua only has one game left against Central Aviation, and the Group A2B championship is no longer in question.</p>
<p>Renyu Beats Chenyou</p>
<p>The first game in Group A1, Renyu vs. Chenyou, was evenly matched. In the first half, 28-26, Chenyou was only behind by two points. The game was fiercely contested throughout, with Renyu having a slight advantage.</p>
<p>The situation remained the same in the second half, and both sides were quite confident in their shooting skills. If the two teams could combine their organizations, it would not be difficult to form a good team. In terms of technology and age, there is hope, but unfortunately, it is feared that the two sides will not be able to cooperate successfully in terms of spirit.</p>
<p>In the last three minutes, two of Chenyou's main players had already fouled out five times and left the court, but their combat effectiveness did not diminish at all. As a result, Renyu won by a narrow margin of 52-49.</p>
<p>Encas Beats Qingbai</p>
<p>The second game in Group A1 last night was Qingbai vs. Encas. The previous game ended at 7:45 PM, and this game did not start until 7:55 PM due to disputes over the referee. Cai Yanxiong's free throw and Chen Xianglong's shot easily scored five points. Through the efforts of Encas's Bao Lai'ao and Chai Liao, they gradually closed in. Zhou Dayun also scored from a distance, and Qingbai took an 11-8 lead within ten minutes. Suddenly, the score was tied 11-11, and the game became even more intense. However, after the score was tied at 18-18, the foreign team stood out, and Encas led 24-20 in the first half.</p>
<p>In the second half, Qingbai replaced Chen Xianglong with Zhang Shaoqing, and Encas also made changes. When Cai Yanxiong and Zhou Yaoyun scored consecutively, the other side was quite flustered. Soon, the foreign team was successful again, and both armies moved fiercely. As a result, Encas defeated Qingbai 46-41. As soon as the game ended, some spectators in the stadium accused and attacked the referee, Yang Liecheng. The authorities are investigating. The atmosphere in the stadium has recently seemed better than in the past, but it is a pity that this incident occurred.</p>

<h3>Tricky Problems in School Administration: Student Guidance in Today's Universities</h3>
<p>— Sun Daoyuan</p>
<p>Among the most difficult and tricky problems in today's university administration, none is perhaps more so than guiding a group of uninhibited university students to behave properly. This guidance work cannot be done well by abstract theorists. Only those who are excellent in both knowledge, experience, and character can be competent and happy. The author has been engaged in university student guidance for many years and now specifically reveals some opinions on the current situation of student guidance in universities, seeking advice from experts.</p>
<p>(1) What is Student Guidance?</p>
<p>Anyone who is practically engaged in or studies university student guidance understands that human education is a continuous development process, with no absolute boundaries between large and small or high and low. However, in order to make the opening of education suitable for the differences in human physiological development from small to large; psychological development from subtle to obvious; and intellectual improvement from low to high, the entire course of education is divided into three levels, large, medium, and small, for teaching.</p>
<p>The three-level education process can be said to be a routine in China and abroad, and consistent throughout ancient and modern times. It is indeed in full harmony with the three movements of life from childhood to adulthood, and from adulthood to old age. Therefore, regardless of whether it is primary, secondary, or university, each has its own distinct timeliness, making people know at a glance: This is the towering highest institution of learning, and that is the children's paradise. This unique school spirit cultivation is the goal of our implementation of "guidance." Although all levels of schools uniformly adopt class teaching, the implementation of "guidance" has different characteristics.</p>
<p>Each Has a Different Internal Quality</p>
<p>From the surface, the implementation of guidance in primary, secondary, and universities is largely the same, with no obvious differences. But from its essence, each has a different internal quality. If we talk about the role of "guidance": primary school is biased towards "nurturing," secondary school is biased towards "managing," and university is biased towards "guiding"; if we talk about the spirit of "guidance": primary school focuses on "love," secondary school focuses on "strictness," and university focuses on "virtue"; in other words, primary school is benevolent "education," secondary school is hegemonic "training," and university is kingly "guidance." Furthermore, in terms of the purpose of implementing guidance: "nurturing" is to help growth, "managing" is to standardize, and "guiding" is to promote self-government. Therefore, the forms of guidance at all levels are different, primary school is "nurturing," secondary school is "hard management," and university is "demonstration."</p>
<p>From the previous analysis, we can know that primary school education is a teacher's problem. With a good teacher, you can nurture good students; secondary school is a problem for both teachers and students. Not only must there be good teachers, but also good students, so that "guidance" can achieve satisfactory results. But university is different. All the achievements of "guidance" depend entirely on the quality of the students. If the students are of good quality, everyone can consciously be a person, automatically learn, and autonomously manage. In this way, why worry about not being able to cultivate a beautiful school spirit and achieve the ideal realm of university guidance? Therefore, the success or failure of university guidance depends entirely on whether students can be conscious, automatic, and autonomous; conversely, the goal of university guidance is to promote and guide students to be conscious, automatic, and autonomous.</p>
<p>Let Him Develop Freely</p>
<p>However, why should different guidance methods be adopted? The reason is that the objects of guidance at all levels are different. For example, primary school students who are growing up are just stepping onto the starting point of the road to adulthood. Not only are they not sound themselves, but everything outside themselves is very vague. They must be nurtured as "adults" at all times, so that they can grow naturally and healthily. However, secondary school students who have undergone six years of primary school education can speak and act freely. Not only can they know everything about people outside of themselves, but they also have a curious mind and the courage to experiment. Therefore, a young person in secondary school is at an age of divergent thoughts and unrestrained behavior; it can also be said that he is at the crossroads of life, which is dangerous and the most hopeful time. Once he goes astray, it will be irreparable. At this most critical juncture in life, only strict discipline can make him conform to the norm. Once a university student has undergone six years of basic secondary school education, the foundation for being a person has been largely established. Only a little guidance from the side is needed, and he can be conscious and self-motivated. Therefore, university students can be allowed to develop and enrich themselves freely in order to complete themselves. Therefore, perfect university education is developed on the basis of sound secondary school education.</p>
<p>(2) How to Implement University Student Guidance?</p>
<p>We understand that the focus of university student guidance is to influence people with virtue and to promote student self-government. It is neither as loving as to primary school students nor as strict as to secondary school students.</p>
<p>Rely on Cooperation</p>
<p>However, how do we implement university student guidance? This is a difficult question to answer. But I think that anyone who is currently engaged in university student guidance work will feel that the success or failure of today's university student guidance is not simply a matter of a university's entire student guidance office setting up various groups for life management, extracurricular activities, sports and hygiene, and its own organization. Because the entire student guidance office of a university is just an organizational structure for handling daily student guidance administrative affairs; in other words, it can only do the passive work of student guidance. As for the active student guidance, it is necessary for all the professors who stand in front of the students every day to cooperate, so that it can be effective. (To be continued)</p>

<h3>Yarn Management Committee Strictly Implements Cotton Certificate Transportation; Most of the Candidates for the Cotton Grading and Inspection Committee Have Been Determined</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] According to sources from the Yarn Management Committee, the committee, in accordance with the detailed rules for the implementation of cotton, stipulates the method for transporting cotton. The public announcement was made earlier and implemented first in Shanghai, Tianjin, and Hankou. Now that the committee's offices in various places have been established one after another, and business is gradually expanding, all offices in various places that are strictly managed should be gradually promoted in order to strengthen control. It is learned that the committee has decided that from March 12 of this year, in all areas where the committee has offices, all cotton transportation and transit must be transferred in accordance with the committee's cotton transportation certificate in accordance with regulations. The committee issued instructions to its Nantong, Hangzhou, Wuhu, Nanjing, Guangzhou, Wuxi, Wujin, Yin County, Jiangyin, and Wu County offices and also sent letters to the Inspectorate General of Customs, Jinling Customs, Guangdong and Zhejiang Maritime Customs, the General Bureau of Highways of the Ministry of Communications, the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway Administrations, and the Yuehan Railway Administration to assist in handling the matter.</p>
<p>[Also reported] In order to implement cotton grading and inspection, the Yarn Management Committee specially organized a cotton grading and inspection committee. After active preparations, most of the candidates for the committee have been determined. Ye Yuanding, consultant of the committee, also serves as the director of the committee. Di Fuyu, a specialist of the Textile Construction Company, serves as the deputy director of the committee. Pan Jianliang, director of the Procurement and Transportation Department, Liu Wenteng, director of the Manufacturing Department, and Tang Yushu, deputy director of the Technology Department, serve as committee members. Most of the staff are transferred from various departments of the Yarn Management Committee. It is said that the office location is temporarily borrowed from the Shanghai Commodity Inspection Bureau.</p>
<h3>Although Prices Briefly Decreased During the Day, Yarn Prices Rose Again Upon Closing; Demand for Cotton Cloth Is Strong and High-End Goods Are Fluctuating</h3>
<p>Yesterday's cotton yarn market was led by customers from Tianjin, Guangdong, and other regions buying in succession, and off-market absorption was also strong, so the market was quite firm. However, due to tight credit, some traders who were short of funds sold slightly at high prices, and prices briefly decreased during the day. Afterwards, strong players saw low prices and took in goods, and arbitrage transactions between spot and futures markets were active, taking the opportunity to move, and the price increase trend in the market re-ignited.</p>
<p>In the end, 42-count Blue Phoenix fine yarn rose another 12 million compared to the previous day, closing at a new high price of 180 million. Bao Guang and Jincheng yarn also rose by 10 million to 12 million, and various other counts of coarse and fine yarn also rose by 4-5 million to 6-7 million.</p>
<p>Yesterday's cotton cloth market opened in the morning with various goods fluctuating at high levels. After 10:00 AM, news spread that the Textile Construction Company was supplying and selling Longtou fine cloth, and it was also heard that yarn prices had fallen, so owners successively sold off goods, and bids slightly decreased. Around 11:00 AM, favorable buying news spread frequently, and with the sharp contraction of the Hong Kong exchange rate and the black market for gold and cash jumping, off-market speculative funds arrived in abundance, and buyers came to absorb them, so the market suddenly saw a surge, and new high prices emerged endlessly.</p>
<p>In the end, 12-pound Longtou Caiqiu and other fine cloths rose another 270,000 to 350,000, and Longtou was bid up to 3.82 million, but there were few sales. In addition, wool serge, tribute drill, bleached cloth, coarse cloth, and Yuanbu shilin cloth all rose sharply.</p>
<p>Also reported: The Textile Construction Company supplied and sold 12-pound Longtou fine cloth, quoted at 3.62 million, and there were buyers absorbing at a premium of 120,000 to 130,000 in the off-market. Four Gentlemen Wool Serge was 3.165 million, and there were also people buying in at a premium of 50,000 to 80,000, and there were many applicants.</p>
<p>Textile Construction Sells Yarn</p>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] The China Textile Construction Company continued to sell yarn on behalf of the Yarn Management Committee yesterday, opening 10 types of yarn and selling 267 pieces, with 100 households approved to purchase.</p>
<p>The opening prices for each count of yarn were: 21-count Golden Double Horse 98 million, 20-count Jincheng 94.5 million, Three Sheep/Zhongxing 92.5 million, Double Happiness/Five Sons 92 million, Golden Tiger/New Sanduo 91 million.</p>

<h3>Rayon Stable and Silk Goods Upward</h3>
<p>The rayon market was stable yesterday, and the final price was similar to the off-market bid price in the evening of the previous day. The opening price of 120-count Xu character bright rayon in the morning was around 234 million, the highest price was 37 million, and it once fell to 24 million.

<h3>Influx of Speculative Capital Drives Hua Stock Prices Higher: Another New High Yesterday</h3>
<p>Yesterday, Hua stocks experienced a surge in activity, with an influx of speculative capital leading to eleven stocks hitting their daily limit. New high prices were frequently recorded, creating a heated and excited atmosphere. However, Yong Yarn's initial surge was followed by some wavering, and a trend of shifting profits into miscellaneous stocks is emerging, with the expectation that this trend will intensify. The market opened high in the morning due to news of the establishment of the Central Counter and the temporary shelving of the American loan proposal.

Yong Yarn's initial spread was 100 yuan, rising from 98 yuan to close at 115 yuan. Xin He's initial spread was 55 yuan, closing at 52 yuan, while the remaining stocks were generally predetermined.</p>

<h3>India Suspends Temporary Ban on Importing Raw Silk for Processing and Export</h3>
<p>Last year, in order to earn foreign exchange, the Central Bank led the China Trust Bureau, China Silk Corporation, silk weaving industry, and other relevant units to organize a silk weaving production and sales coordination association. The government purchased raw silk for processing and export, weaving 100,000 bolts of silk fabrics for sale to India. This year, the plan was to process 250,000 bolts for sale to India. Tang Xixiang, Deputy General Manager of China Silk Corporation, traveled to Beijing some days ago to consult with the National Economic Council and the Ministry of Economic Affairs. It has been learned that the government has recently decided to temporarily suspend processing and export to India due to special domestic and international prices and India's import ban. The 420 bales recently transacted by the China Trust Bureau have had their import deadline extended to the 15th of this month.</p>
<h3>Tight Credit Market, Slow Retail Sales; Rice Prices Rise Sharply, Then Retreat Slightly; Limited Supply of Edible Oil, Prices Increase Gradually</h3>
<p>After a sharp rise in rice prices, there was a slight retreat yesterday. The closing price on the previous day already showed signs of fatigue, so the market opened lower yesterday. This was because the price of tin ingots had been set, the credit market was very tight, and retail sales at rice stores were slow due to the widespread distribution of household rice. With sluggish store sales, traders were even less willing to add inventory. Those who needed cash frequently sold their holdings.</p>
<p>Except for the special grade white粳 rice in the North City market, which remained firm at 30,000 yuan, all other rice prices fell by 50,000 to 100,000 yuan. In the South City market, white粳 rice was priced at 3.65 million yuan, a decrease of 100,000 yuan. Early and thin rice varieties each decreased by 50,000 yuan, and except for the high-priced Gaoyang秈 rice, other 秈 rice varieties also decreased by 50,000 yuan. White元 rice retreated to 3.8 million yuan, while the special high-grade粳 rice in the North City market remained at the original price of 3.85 million yuan. As the market neared closing, the weather turned rainy, strengthening market sentiment slightly and stabilizing prices.</p>
<p>Flour</p>
<p>Fluctuations were narrow, resulting in a slightly lower price compared to the previous day. The decline in rice prices had some impact on market sentiment, coupled with the tight credit market and ample supplies from the factories.</p>
<p>Lao Che flour opened at 1.48 million yuan, later retreating to 1.475 million yuan. The delivered price was 1.48 million yuan. Bing Chuan flour opened at 1.47 million yuan, closing at 1.46 million yuan, with warehouse receipts lower by 10,000 to 20,000 yuan compared to the previous day. Red Bee and Jian Cheng were slightly weaker by about 10,000 yuan compared to the previous day. Jian Cheng reached a high of 1.46 million yuan, closing at 1.445 million yuan. Miscellaneous brands of flour still had considerable retail sales. Peacock's delivered price was 1.465 million yuan. Bran was weak and unable to recover, with large bags closing 10,000 yuan lower than the previous day.</p>
<p>Grains</p>
<p>Prices were flat initially, then strengthened. Due to the decline in rice prices, market sentiment was initially very weak, resulting in a flat opening. Soybean prices were not low in the producing areas, so owners were reluctant to sell, resulting in prices barely holding at the mouse price at the opening. Later, it was heard that oil cakes had risen in price, so oil mills came to buy them. Hankou乍豆 opened at 1.8 million yuan, with the final transaction price at 1.88 million yuan (purchased by Tong Shen Tai Oil Mill), an increase of 80,000 yuan compared to the previous day. Che Dou opened at 2 million yuan, but later purchases were not possible. Pinghu特粗 saw a new high price of 2.38 million yuan.</p>
<p>Corn was initially weak, but later Qingdao traders came to buy, raising prices by 20,000 to 30,000 yuan. Red sorghum rose by 50,000 to 100,000 yuan. Green beans were purchased by indigenous traders, with limited inventory, rising by over 100,000 yuan. Picked green was flat and weak. Sesame Tianjin traders did not purchase, with only yellow vine and milk hemp rising by 50,000 yuan, while white hemp remained flat. Although Guangdong traders purchased peanuts, the quantity was not large, and prices also rose by about 200,000 yuan, with high-quality peanuts rising by 300,000 yuan. Today is the anniversary of Sun Yat-sen's death, and the market is closed for one day.</p>
<p>Edible Oil</p>
<p>Prices rose sharply at the opening, due to a decrease in supply and high production costs. Furthermore, due to the sharp rise in prices of other goods outside the industry, holders were generally reluctant to sell at lower prices. Also, due to the market being closed today, many retailers pre-stocked, so sales were still active.</p>
<p>Previously closed positions were opened first. Da You soybean oil rose from 7.05 million yuan, increasing step by step, reaching a high of 7.25 million yuan, and closing at 7.2 million yuan, an increase of 200,000 yuan compared to the previous day. Later, factories such as Da Tong and Chang De opened at 7.2 million yuan, with Ji Tong raw oil opening at a high of 8 million yuan. Qingdao Ji Tong raw oil opened at 8.2 million yuan, and Jiangbei Ji Tong raw oil opened at 8.2 million yuan, each rising by 300,000 yuan compared to the previous day. Raw and cooked vegetable oils each rose by about 200,000 yuan. Ji Tong small-wheeled sesame oil opened at 7.7 million yuan, immediately reaching the 8 million yuan mark, an increase of 400,000 yuan. Shantou traders purchased bean cakes, raising prices by 40,000 to 50,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Foreign Rice Arrives in Shanghai</p>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] The Isthmian Steamship Company's Steamer Eads arrived in Shanghai yesterday morning with over 11,000 bags of rice and over 1,060 large barrels of tobacco leaves from San Francisco. It is currently berthed at the Gong He Xiang Wharf for unloading.</p>
<h3>Tea Merchants Discuss Loan Issues: This Year's Exported Tea May Reach 360,000 Dan</h3>
<p>The China Tea Association, recognizing the importance of this year's tea loan issues, specially convened a meeting at 2:00 PM yesterday, gathering the Shanghai Tea Export Industry Association, the Shanghai Tea Trade Commercial Association, the first and second district Tea Manufacturing Industry Association, and representatives from producing areas in Zhejiang, Anhui, and Jiangxi, at the Bank Club in the city. The meeting discussed in detail the number of tea loans applied for by each tea merchant, as well as the advantages and disadvantages of (A) production loans, (B) sight loans, and (C) order loans. The meeting was chaired by the association's chairman, Shou Jingwei. Nine individuals, including Shou Jingwei, Sun Xiaocun, Zhu Huiqing, Zeng Yuchen, Tang Jisan, Song Qifan, Fang Junqiang, Wu Juenong, and Huang Yantang, were selected to devise practical measures and negotiate with those in charge of export trade and tea loan financing. The meeting adjourned at around 5:00 PM.</p>
<p>[Further Report] According to knowledgeable sources in the tea industry, this year's exported tea may reach 360,000 dan, including 90,000 dan of black tea, 150,000 dan of green tea, and 120,000 dan of Taiwanese tea. Based on the current foreign exchange market price, total exports could generate over 20 million US dollars.</p>
<p>[Further Report] According to the China Tea Association's estimate, this year's tea production in each region is as follows: Pingshui green tea 70,000 dan, Qimen black tea 10,000 dan, Wenzhou black tea 7,000 dan, Hekou black tea 3,000 dan, Tunxi green tea 30,000 dan, Fujian green tea 25,000 dan, Fujian black tea 25,000 dan, and 10,000 dan from other producing areas, totaling 241,000 dan. If the purchase price is calculated at 5 shi of rice per dan, and 3 million yuan per dan of rice, the total capital required is over 360 billion yuan.</p>
<h3>Cigarette Prices Soar Wildly</h3>
<p>Yesterday's cigarette market saw chaotic price quotations, with the market experiencing a shortage of supply. Various cigarettes reached new highs. Ten-packs of British cigarettes broke through the 90 million yuan barrier, soaring to 95.5 million yuan at closing, a staggering increase of 11.2 million yuan. Old Knife cigarettes broke through the 80 million yuan barrier, reaching a high of 84 million yuan, also an increase of 11.15 million yuan. Other Chinese and foreign cigarettes also rose by about 5% to 20%.</p>
<h3>Paper Industry Not Worried About Shortages, Self-Sufficiency to Be Achieved This Year</h3>
<p>The monthly consumption of cigarette paper in this city was previously surveyed to be about 120,000 reams. The cigarette paper produced by the Minfeng Paper Factory in Jiaxing, which is affiliated with the Minfeng Paper Company in this city, is the only high-quality domestic product, with a monthly output of 30,000 reams, far short of market demand. The Export Control Commission had no choice but to approve the import of American cigarette paper to make up for the shortfall. Knowing the country's foreign exchange difficulties, the Minfeng Factory has been repeatedly urged by the government to do everything possible. A machine that was previously stored in Hong Kong was shipped to Hebei. The trial production results were excellent, and manufacturing has now begun. It is estimated that the monthly output can be increased by 30,000 reams, bringing the total monthly output to 60,000 reams. However, this is still insufficient to meet the actual needs, and the Minfeng Factory's power equipment is limited, making it impossible to add more paper machines in the short term. It has recently been learned that the company has opened up new avenues for increased production. Two cigarette paper machines will be installed in its sister factory, the Huafeng Paper Factory in Hangzhou. One of these machines is expected to be in production in June or July. The other machine will be put into production within the year after the construction of the new factory building is completed. These two machines can also produce 60,000 reams per month. In total, the two factories can produce 120,000 reams per month, which is sufficient to meet the actual needs of the market. Before the Huafeng Paper Factory in Hangzhou can produce cigarette paper, the total number of paper reams imported in the fourth quarter, as reported by the Tobacco Industry Daily, is over 210,000, with an average of 70,000 reams per month. Adding the 60,000 reams produced by Minfeng each month, the number is already sufficient to meet the needs of various factories in this city, and there is absolutely no fear of shortage at present. Furthermore, as a result of the efforts of Minfeng and Huafeng factories, self-sufficiency can be achieved within the year. Under the national policy of conserving foreign exchange and advocating the use of domestic goods, this is indeed good news for the economic and industrial sectors.</p>
<h3>Cement Industry Needs Paper Bags, Please Specify the Amount of US Dollars</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] In order to cooperate with the economic reform plan, the National Cement Association plans to request the authorities to specify the amount of US dollars allowed for importing paper bags each month based on the actual output of cement factories nationwide, so as to increase production and facilitate exports. The association has recently submitted a request to the Executive Yuan, National Economic Council, Ministry of Economic Affairs, Central Bank, and Export Control Commission. The original submission stated: It is expected that by the end of June this year, the total national cement production can be drastically increased to 195,850 metric tons per month. The monthly need for paper bags will reach a staggering 3,917,000 pieces. However, the current price for paper bags ordered from the United States is approximately US$0.15 per piece. According to the total national cement production at the end of June this year, the monthly foreign exchange required is no more than US$587,000. If the overseas market can be opened up as desired, assuming that 1 million bags of cement are shipped out each month, calculated at US$1.50 per bag F.O.B., the foreign exchange income would be three times that amount. Therefore, it is hoped that the amount of US dollars allowed for import each month will be specified to facilitate production.</p>
<h3>Sino-Australian Trade Agreement to Be Officially Announced Tomorrow</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] The Sino-Australian trade agreement has been signed some days ago and will be officially announced tomorrow. It is understood that the agreement stipulates that goods worth up to A$100 can be freely exported. Goods exceeding that value will require an export permit issued by the Export Control Commission before being cleared. It is hoped that smuggling between Australia and Hong Kong will be eliminated after the agreement is implemented.</p>
<h3>Commercial Briefs</h3>
<p>The Gold Control Bureau has notified various commercial firms and banks that overdrafts for their clients must not be easily accommodated. Once it is discovered that any firm or bank is not complying with the regulations and is casually providing overdrafts to illegitimate industrial and commercial enterprises, severe penalties will be imposed.</p>
<p>The textile machinery production and manufacturing conference is scheduled to be held tomorrow (the 12th) at 9:00 AM at No. 27 Dihua Road. Minister of Economic Affairs Chen Qitian has decided to personally attend the conference in Shanghai, and up to forty experts will be in attendance.</p>
<p>In order to crack down on privately established radio stations and encourage whistleblowing, the Shanghai Financial Management Bureau previously stipulated that a reward of 20 million yuan should be given for cases cracked by military and police agencies. In cases where there is an informant, half of the amount, 10 million yuan, will be paid to the informant. It is learned that the Financial Management Bureaus in Tianjin, Hankou, and Guangzhou have found that this measure to encourage whistleblowing has been quite effective and have also implemented it as an example.</p>
<p>Regarding the measures to crack down on hoarding newspapers, the City Chamber of Commerce previously requested an extension of the implementation period. It is learned that the city government has explicitly rejected the request. After receiving the order, the Chamber of Commerce has informed its members to comply.</p>
<p>Huaxin Woolen Company, a giant in the woolen industry, is currently holding a major sale from the 10th of this month to thank new and old customers. It is heard that the sale will only last for a few more days.</p>
<h3>Special Foreign Currency Certificates of Deposit: Importers and Exporters Request Combining Use in the Next Quarter</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] The Shanghai Import and Export Commercial Association stated that the original plan for the special foreign currency certificates of deposit was to start being used in the fourth quarter. Due to procedural reasons, they have not yet been issued. It is stipulated that after the issuance, the amount that could have been offset starting from the fourth quarter can be used together in the next quarter. A telegram was sent to the Central Bank and the Import and Export Management Committee, with the following original text: "We have reviewed the Import and Export Management Committee's Announcement No. 7, Detailed Rules for the Implementation of Measures for Handling Unlicensed Foreign Exchange Arrivals and Cargo Shipments, Article 5: 'Registered qualified importers, starting from November of this year, may use the aforementioned special foreign currency certificates of deposit to borrow one-sixth of the face value of foreign exchange from the Central Bank each quarter to pay for import goods within their quota.' We believe that 'starting from November,' as referred to in this article, actually includes starting from the fourth quarter quota, a fact that your representatives and others mutually agreed upon during previous consultations with you. However, since the beginning of purchasing and distribution of these foreign exchange arrival goods, due to the various procedural relationships involved in reviewing, approving, purchasing, distributing, and submitting various procedures, not a single one of these special foreign currency certificates of deposit has been issued to this day. And the fourth quarter quota has long been completed; bills of exchange have also been issued one after another, and no importer has been able to use these certificates of deposit to offset the fourth quarter quota of foreign exchange. This association has repeatedly received requests from its members to respectfully request that you understand the difficulties of the business community and consider the facts, and formally stipulate that these special foreign currency certificates of deposit can be used to offset and borrow from the fourth quarter onwards. If there are situations where the certificates of deposit are not received before the fourth and fifth quarters due to purchasing and distribution procedures, making it impossible to offset them, then in the next quarter's quota, the amount that could have been used and borrowed in previous quarters can be used together to offset and borrow, so as to comply with the law and avoid disputes. This request, although inherently justified, requires an explicit order for its implementation. Therefore, we specially telegraph the facts and respectfully request your approval for public announcement and implementation to benefit the business community."</p>

<h3>Returning from the National Medical Association Conference</h3>
<p>— Liang Junqing</p>
<p>I, along with several senior doctors from Shanghai, attended the Second National Physicians' Association Joint Conference in Nanjing for three days. I saw and heard many things and had many feelings, and I wanted to write them down. However, because it concerns the conference and is not related to this publication, I will temporarily keep it to myself and wait for another opportunity. Alas, yellow bells and clay pots are all over the world, so why should I, as a simple individual, offer my shallow opinions and seek approval from others? Therefore, I will take a different approach and gather what is related to medicine and pharmaceuticals, hoping that it will also be appreciated by the readers.</p>
<p>(1) Minister Zhou's Cautionary Words: At the beginning of the conference, Minister Zhou of the Ministry of Health gave an opening speech with cautionary words: "The most successful countries in the world in terms of healthcare are the Nordic countries, where the average lifespan is around 65 years. In our country, due to poor sanitation facilities and high infant mortality rates, the average lifespan has been reduced to around 30 years. In fact, a person's career begins around the age of 40. If the average lifespan of our people is so short, how can we compete with European and American countries? This requires the assistance of the national medical and pharmaceutical community." These words are truly to the point and full of earnestness. Not only must all of us in the medical community work together to assist the health authorities, but also the general public must be vigilant, take good care of themselves, and not bring shame upon the name of "Sick Man of East Asia."</p>
<p>(2) Lamentations of Domestic Western Medicine Manufacturers: I am very grateful for the lavish hospitality of the domestic Western medicine manufacturers at this conference. However, Dr. Yang, director of the Yang Chemical Research Institute, gave a sorrowful speech: "Most of the Western medicines used in our country are imported. Although some Chinese people have established pharmaceutical factories to produce Western medicines themselves, due to the deep-rooted habit of Chinese people to worship Western medicines, they only know how to purchase imported products and do not promote domestic Western medicines. This has led to the inability of domestic Western medicines to develop, which is truly regrettable." In fact, domestic Western medicines are not inferior to imported ones. It is the slavish mentality of worshiping imported goods that has led to the rejection of good domestic Western medicines, which is truly heartbreaking. Nowadays, the country is facing difficulties, and foreign exchange is often unavailable for purchase. Moreover, the world is currently in a precarious state. If there is another World War III, then all imported Western medicines will certainly be unavailable for purchase, wouldn't that leave the sick to die? Therefore, as a precaution, we must do our best to support the development of domestic Western medicines within the scope of possibility. In the future, with continuous improvement and soaring development, who knows if they will not surpass imported products? I sincerely hope for the awakening of the medical and pharmaceutical community and the national people of our country.</p>
<p>(3) The Benefits of Travel: I have been living in Shanghai, a city surrounded by an environment of chaos and danger. Not only am I getting gray hair easily and aging quickly, but I am also exhausted mentally and physically, making it difficult to achieve longevity. I stayed in Nanjing for only three days, but due to the change of environment, my spirit was revitalized and my appetite was enhanced. I used to have trouble sleeping and would wake up easily, but now I fall asleep as soon as I go to bed and sleep soundly until dawn, which is completely different from before. This is truly a gift from travel. I sincerely hope that people in Shanghai will take short trips during the pleasant days of spring and autumn, and their gains will definitely outweigh their losses.</p>
<p>(4) The Harms of Travel: Although travel has many benefits for our bodies, it also has its harms. When we live in one place for a long time, we become accustomed to the climate changes there and are not affected by them. However, once we travel, it is difficult to adapt to the climate of a different place. As a result, we may catch a disease. However, the most harmful thing to our bodies is sunlight. According to recent medical reports, the substances in the human body can have different tolerance levels and therefore react differently to sunlight. Some people die of heatstroke after traveling in the sun for one or two hours. Others develop dermatitis or herpes after being exposed to the sun for one or two hours (Dr. Wu Tianmin's skin became inflamed immediately after being exposed to the sun, and I personally witnessed his inflammation after being exposed to the sun during this trip to Nanjing). Still others, who usually have fair complexions, immediately turn black after being exposed to the sun. All of these are related to sunlight. If we are not adequately prepared beforehand, then traveling in the sun will not only fail to benefit us but will actually harm us, which is truly not worth it.</p>
<h3>Medical News</h3>
<p>— Cang Long</p>
<p>(1) Treatment for Night Sweats and Insomnia in Pulmonary Tuberculosis</p>
<p>According to reports from Mr. Mauderli and Mr. Magg of Switzerland, during the course of pulmonary tuberculosis, patients often experience fatigue, loss of appetite, night sweats, insomnia, and palpitations. Many people believe this is due to the patient's physical weakness and prescribe various tonics, but the results are not only ineffective but even worsen the underlying condition. In fact, the aforementioned symptoms of night sweats and insomnia are due to autonomic nervous dysfunction. The use of medications that regulate the autonomic nervous system (such as Bellergal from Sandoz Pharmaceuticals) can be very effective.</p>
<p>(2) The Danger of Children Swallowing Objects While Playing</p>
<p>According to a report in the Hungarian Pediatrics Journal of February last year, a six-year-old child suddenly cried inconsolably while playing. When his parents asked why, he said he had swallowed a nail. He was taken to the hospital for treatment. However, repeated X-ray examinations in the hospital failed to find any foreign object in his abdomen. It was thought that the child might be lying, so he was sent home. However, shortly after returning home, the child suddenly developed a high fever and gradually showed symptoms of pneumonia and pleurisy, which lasted for a long time without recovery. He was then sent to Hungary's largest pediatric hospital for treatment. As a result, an X-ray revealed a piece of glass, about 33 millimeters long, lodged in the bifurcation of his left bronchus. However, because the foreign object had been inhaled into the trachea for four months, granulation tissue had grown around it, making it difficult to remove. Only specialized instruments could be used to extract it. The child's trachea had developed severe chronic inflammation due to the long-term presence of the foreign object. Fortunately, large doses of penicillin were able to cure him.</p>
<p>(3) The Establishment of a Corneal Bank in New York</p>
<p>According to the Vienna Medical Weekly published in August of last year, a corneal bank has been established in New York City to meet the needs of those suffering from corneal opacity. It is reported that recently, five thousand blind patients have regained their sight after corneal transplantation.</p>
<p>(4) The Filterable Virus of Infantile Paralysis (Poliomyelitis)</p>
<p>According to a report from Stanford University in California, it is now possible to completely analyze the filterable virus of infantile paralysis using ultramicroscopic examination methods. It is said that this filterable virus is a protein-like substance with a diameter of approximately 25 microns (one micron equals one-thousandth of a millimeter). Based on this discovery, it will be possible to develop a preventative vaccine in the future. It is noted that this disease has recently been discovered in Shanghai. It initially presents with high fever, vomiting, coma, convulsions, and excessive sweating. If death does not occur within two or three days, the patient gradually recovers but develops paralysis, such as the inability to move one hand or arm, or one foot or leg. This condition is very difficult to treat, and even with treatment, it takes a long time to recover. Its contagiousness is also very high. If a preventative vaccine can be injected, it would be of great benefit to the citizens of Shanghai.</p>
<p>(5) International Conference on Rheumatism in September Last Year</p>
<p>In September of last year, an international conference on rheumatism was held in Copenhagen, the capital of Denmark. The content included detailed reviews of "The cause and development of infectious rheumatic arthritis," "Treatment issues for infectious rheumatic arthritis," "The significance of rheumatism's threat to humanity," and "Climatic factors in rheumatism." I will write about the details when I have time.</p>
<h3>Sending Off Dr. Wang Juerong Abroad</h3>
<p>— Ma Dian</p>
<p>Dr. Wang Juerong is a medical doctor from Aurora University. He has practiced medicine in Shanghai for many years, but I had no opportunity to meet him, until about a year ago, when he began serving in our Medical Association. In the past eleven months, we have had many opportunities to talk, and I deeply admire not only his outstanding knowledge and quick wit, but also his spirit of service, which is unmatched by ordinary people. Dr. Wang is inherently hardworking. He runs a clinic, manages a pharmacy, heads a hospital, and directs a pharmaceutical factory. He usually navigates between different social classes, and he already spends his time busily. Yet, he still serves the city of Shanghai: organizing the affairs of the Medical Association, establishing a location for the Medical News Agency, and, when medical disputes arise, he always takes the lead, personally participating in forensic examinations and public notarization, even neglecting sleep and forgetting to eat, showing such courage and righteousness. Moreover, Dr. Wang is hardworking, uncomplaining, and doesn't take credit for his success. His sincerity in sacrificing for the public is enough to inspire the world and reform bad customs. It is not only the medical community that is moved by this. Last fall, Dr. Wang was selected by the Ministry of Education of our friendly country, France, and will soon be going abroad for further study. Of course, his existing domestic businesses must be temporarily entrusted to others. However, his enthusiasm for handling multiple responsibilities will be difficult for anyone to replicate! Therefore, Dr. Wang's departure is something to celebrate privately, but there is also a sense of regret publicly! Now that the day of departure is approaching, I would like to follow the ancient custom of expressing feelings on paper and use a corner of this publication to offer a farewell. The disorder of medical affairs and hygiene in China today cannot be denied. There are many reasons for this, but the lack of a proper medical administration is a serious problem. In recent decades, the country has not cultivated genuine medical administration talents who are willing to sacrifice for the public good. The difficulty of putting medical administration on the right track should not be blamed! Therefore, I hope that Dr. Wang, in addition to studying new medical knowledge to further develop his existing businesses, will also devote some time to studying medical administration abroad, learn from their successes and failures, and contribute his findings to the country. I predict that he, who has previously served the entire Shanghai community, will serve the entire national community in the future, and benefiting the entire Chinese nation will not be difficult! Farewell, Dr. Wang, take care, take care!</p>
<h3>A Brief Discussion on Infantile Hematemesis and Melena</h3>
<p>— Wu Manqing</p>
<p>Infantile hematemesis and melena is a rare disease, the cause of which has not yet been fully understood. I still remember that Walter Nischer (a famous German pathologist, who was the director of the Institute of Pathology at the University of Rostock in Germany before the war and once served as a professor of pathology at Tongji University Medical School. His superb knowledge and great personality are still praised by early Tongji graduates) once advocated, "If we encounter such patients in the future, we must conduct a detailed examination to thoroughly understand the cause." This aroused my interest, and I will now describe the recent research findings as follows:</p>
<p>Regarding the origin of the name Infantile Hematemesis and Melena (Melaena Neonatorum), we can trace it back to the writings of the Western philosopher Hippocrates, who wrote about this disease as early as 400 years BC (see De Marbis H, 73) and called it Marfus niger Hippokrates. According to Kleler's later interpretation, infantile hematemesis and melena is a disease of the gastrointestinal tract in children that causes a lot of bleeding. It occurs mostly in the first few days or weeks of a child's life. The symptoms are severe vomiting and diarrhea, with the vomited or diarrheal matter being blood, blood clots, or black, lumpy substances (blood turns black when it comes into contact with stomach acid). The bleeding usually occurs within the first one or two days of a child's life, and the latest it can occur is the eighteenth day after birth.</p>
<p>The most severe bleeding often leads to death within 48 hours due to excessive blood loss. However, according to Nleischmano's report, there have also been cases of children suffering from this disease and dying as late as seventeen days later. Anders traced the medical literature back to 1885 and found only 48 cases of this disease. According to Hecker's report, about one in five hundred newborns may suffer from it. However, according to Gennrich's statistics, about one in one thousand deliveries in the obstetrics hospitals of Berlin, Germany, encounters this disease.</p>
<p>Regarding the cause of this disease, opinions vary. Ruge believed that there are two causes: one is a systemic disease, such as syphilis, bacterial infection, or acute fatty degeneration. The other is a local cause, such as circulatory disorders in the local area or ulcers in the gastrointestinal tract. However, clinical reports show that the so-called ulcers can also occur in surviving newborns. According to Prof. DR. Entz's report, about 100% of ulcerative patients he investigated and statistically analyzed had ulcers in the duodenum, and they were all very weak children with malnutrition. Based on the opinions of the above-mentioned gentlemen, a conclusion can be drawn: "Infantile hematemesis and melena is mostly caused by ulcers in the stomach, intestines, lower esophagus, and upper part of the pylorus. The direct cause of the ulcer, as well as the location and time of occurrence, are not yet fully understood."</p>
<p>Spiegelberg believed that the ulcer occurred as early as in the womb. Landau did not agree, and he strongly argued that the occurrence of this disease is due to "the fact that the respiratory function of the child is not completely normal after birth, because the air in the lungs has not yet expanded, and the Ductus Botalli and umbilical vein, which originally connected the pulmonary artery and the aorta, develop thrombosis. The thrombus then migrates into the arteries, and finally, this migrating thrombus tightly blocks the arteries between the pancreas and the duodenum, thus causing ulcers." V. Frauque believed that the above-mentioned theory of regressive thrombosis is quite reasonable. The effect of thrombosis can cause spastic obstruction of blood vessels (Embelisce Gefanversperrumg), and the obstruction of blood vessels can promote ulcers and bleeding in the ulcerated area. At the same time, due to the obstruction, there is stagnation of blood flow, fatigue of the heart, fragility of the blood vessel wall, and abnormal permeability of the blood vessel wall, which can cause a large amount of bleeding and become hematemesis and melena. I once saw a case with very obvious symptoms, which I specially noted here for readers' reference:</p>
<p>"A child was born in the 'second cephalic position'. He had no breathing at birth, and he only breathed after one hour of various artificial respiration resuscitation techniques. However, his face was always blue and purple, and his breathing was very rapid. On the second day, his face became even more blue and purple, his pupils dilated, and his eyes stared like a fighting cock's eyes. The patient fainted several times. Later, the patient had bloody stools, his breathing slowed down, and his temperature rose to 38.3 degrees Celsius. Then, the bloody stools did not stop, and he had a high fever (39.4 degrees Celsius). Finally, he died on the fourth day.</p>
<p>This child weighed 3 kilograms and 20 grams, was 49cm long, had a head circumference of 34cm, and a shoulder width of 35cm. His skin was very pale. The umbilical cord was normal, but there was a segment of about 8cm of umbilical cord protruding, surrounded by yellow-green fluid. Autopsy revealed that both the umbilical artery and the umbilical vein had blood clots the thickness of goose feathers adhering to them. The blood clots were dark red and adhered to the blood vessel walls. There were countless small bleeding spots in the pleura and the outer membrane of the myocardium, which did not disappear when pressed with a finger. His spleen was slightly enlarged. His esophagus was the right size, but it was very anemic. There was obvious thrombosis only in the first segment. At the entrance to the stomach, there was a 5mm long and 3mm wide round ulcer, surrounded by hyperemia. The stomach was empty, and the mucosa was not thickened, but there was blood stagnation. Near the pylorus, there was also a large ulcer with a lot of blood accumulation. From the jejunum to the anus, there were many black blood clots, but sometimes there was also liquid blood. "</p>
<p>If we consider the above situation in detail, we can infer that the purulent condition of the umbilical vein of this child can be considered a direct cause of umbilical vascular embolism. If the umbilical vascular embolism causes thrombosis in the area to which it belongs, and even promotes the occurrence of ulcers in the gastrointestinal tract, there is also a sufficient reason.</p>

<h3>"Sweep the Snow from Your Own Doorstep"</h3>
<p>— Wu Yong</p>
<p>The Shen Bao, from the thirteenth year of the Tongzhi reign of the late Qing Dynasty, carried an article titled "Questions and Answers in Shanghai," which recorded a question and answer session between a Westerner and a Chinese person. The Westerner, newly arrived in Shanghai, wandered through the city and saw broken bricks and tiles piled up like mountains at the city gate, with no one to clear them away, and the road was almost blocked. He was quite puzzled by this and asked the Chinese person to clarify the matter. The Chinese person offered various explanations, but the Westerner still couldn't understand it. He continued to ask questions, and the Chinese person became impatient, annoyed by his nosiness, and replied to the Westerner, "You are a foreigner, why bother? As the saying goes, 'Sweep the snow from your own doorstep, and don't worry about the frost on another's roof.' Can you please mind your own business?" The Westerner said, "Ah! If everyone sweeps the snow from their own doorstep, why is the city gate of your esteemed country not taken care of?"</p>
<p>"Sweep the snow from your own doorstep, and don't worry about the frost on another's roof" is an old saying. After examining its meaning, I believe it can have two interpretations. The first interpretation is naturally to tell people not to meddle in other people's affairs, focusing on the second half of the sentence: "Don't worry about the frost on another's roof." This is a passive interpretation. The author believes that in addition to this interpretation, there can also be an active interpretation, which is to shift the focus of the sentence to the first half; in other words, "Sweep the snow from your own doorstep" is to teach people to stick to their own positions and do what they should do.</p>
<p>Most people are probably only familiar with the meaning of the second half of this common saying, and they have neglected the active inspiration of the first half. "Don't worry about the frost on another's roof" is certainly not objectionable. What does the frost on another person's roof have to do with you? If you insist on interfering, you will inevitably break the tiles on the person's roof, and what good will that do you? This kind of overstepping of one's bounds will only neglect one's own tasks and deviate from one's proper position, and the snow in front of one's own door will be left unattended.</p>
<p>In the current malady, as I personally see it, is that some people are not sweeping the snow from their own doorsteps, but they are abandoning their own tasks and interfering in other people's affairs. Some may say that "Don't worry about the frost on another's roof" is a manifestation of the selfishness and lack of social awareness of the Chinese people. However, if people fulfill their duties and do what they should do, this can lead to a state of "national prosperity and people's peace." What is the use of "social awareness" then? The reason why "social awareness" is needed today is simply because some people in society have not fulfilled their duties and have not done what they should do.</p>
<p>Therefore, "Sweep the snow from your own doorstep" can be used as a motto for everyone. If you go the other way, I will worry about the frost on your roof, and you will sweep the snow in front of my door, the result will inevitably be: the frost cannot be removed, and the snow cannot be cleared, only increasing many unnecessary frictions and disputes. If things go wrong, you may even throw the frost on your roof onto other people's houses, or push the snow in front of your door to your neighbor's door. Looking at the examples of shirking responsibility and blaming each other in society, it is truly countless and everywhere. From individuals to individuals, from organizations to organizations, and even from country to country, there is no place without this kind of "cultivating other people's fields" and "overstepping one's bounds." When disputes arise between each other, they always say that the other party is "actually responsible," and when things break down, they always say that the other party "should bear full responsibility." Few people admit that they are wrong. Take the military buildup as an example. Countries always blame the other party for starting the arms race, so their own country has no choice but to do the same to defend itself. Why not try the opposite approach: first disarm all of our own country's weapons and equipment, and dismiss all of our troops, and see what the other party will do? It is said that British police officers only carry batons and do not carry guns, and the number of British police officers killed by thugs is far less than in the United States. From this, it can be seen that "even thieves have principles," and we do not have to guess at the worst of human nature.</p>
<p>Only pointing out the faults of others and not seeing one's own dereliction of duty are all for the sake of "self." There has never been a greater failure to practice empathy than today—or it seems that it has never been practiced at all. In my opinion, precisely because it has never been practiced at all, there is an increasingly urgent need to implement it immediately today.</p>
<h3>Memory</h3>
<p>— Leng Leng</p>
<p>Asa Gray, America's most famous botanist, was able to remember the names of twenty-five thousand plants; Caesar could also remember the names of tens of thousands of his trusted soldiers.</p>
<p>The famous English poet Byron boasted that he could recite all the verses he had written; but on the contrary, Walter Scott's memory was terrible, and he would even forget the poems he had written himself. Once he mistook his own work for one written by Byron and praised it profusely. As for the English essayist and philosopher Bacon, he could write from memory his most famous work without missing a word; but like the American stage star Joseph Jefferson, although he had played in "Rip Van Winkle" for thirteen years, he still often forgot his lines.</p>
<p>Charlie Chaplin had a personal secretary who never left his side for seven years, but the strangest thing is that, according to this secretary, Chaplin still didn't know his name!</p>
<p>Al-Azhar University in Egypt is considered the second largest university in the world. The university's custom is that every year, new students must recite the entire Quran for their entrance exam. This Quran is nearly as long as the New Testament of Christianity, and reciting it once takes at least three days; but every year, more than 20,000 people are able to recite it completely without any omissions. How amazing is this kind of memory!</p>
<p>The memory of former U.S. President Theodore Roosevelt is also worth praising. When receiving guests, he liked to pay attention to their small details, faces, or actions; once he had seen you, he would never forget you again. Undoubtedly, this was of great help to his political activities and often had unexpected effects. Once, he met a Japanese banker whom he had not seen for fifteen years. To the Japanese banker's surprise, the moment he met him, he began to talk about something they had talked about during their first meeting fifteen years ago.</p>
<h3>Occasional Thoughts on a Spring Outing</h3>
<p>— Nian Hong</p>
<p>The weather is nice and warm, and although time and money constraints prevent me from visiting any famous scenic spots, I still have to take a stroll in the nearby suburbs. Accustomed to living in a small room, seeing the open fields and hills once in a while, although not as elegant and interesting as exploring plum blossoms and climbing mountains, already feels interesting and has a different flavor. At least in the countryside, I don't see the detestable and boring merchants, and the simple and hardworking farmers have their own loveliness.</p>
<p>I have very few opportunities to come into contact with the countryside, so of course I don't know what their way of life and content are really like. When I was young, I read the verses of Fan Chengda of the Southern Song Dynasty. In those tranquil words, there was a strong fragrance, writing about the life of farmers, simple and beautiful, and it was very tempting for people who were tired of urban life. Therefore, when I was young, I especially liked Fan Chengda's sixty poems of "Four Seasons of Rural Life," and I imagined a very lovely farm scene in my weak mind, and I even had the ideal of living in the countryside when I grew up. I even particularly liked to eat fresh vegetables, and I had the same hobby of "the rich do not find meat flavorful, but only use vegetables as ordinary dishes," and like Fang Weng's famous sentence: "Birds compete to throw themselves into trees, returning cows know their own homes." Fan's "Mulberry trees are sparse under the spring, edges are full of ridges, cabbage hearts are green and tender, mustard platforms are fat, wash and choose by the stream to sell in the shop, sell salt for wine in the evening," "In the sound of laughter and singing, the light thunder moves, threshing all night until dawn," and other beautiful sentences, I recited them again and again, and I especially loved them.</p>
<p>But later, as I got older and read more books, I began to doubt whether the countryside was so worth longing for. I went to the countryside a few times by chance and felt that there was natural beauty, but "farmhouse fun" was not necessarily the case. Even in the Southern Song Dynasty in Fan Chengda's time, it was not necessarily so beautiful. The "History of the Song Dynasty" also says: "Among the four classes of people, the farmers are the most suffering... Fortunately, there is a harvest, and the debts of the government and private individuals compete with each other, and the grain has not yet been harvested, and the silk has not yet come off the loom, and it is no longer one's own..." Also, "If it is a famine year, there is no grain to sell, and the land cannot be sold, so they kill cattle and sell meat, and cut down mulberry trees for firewood. They cannot afford to think about next year's livelihood." This situation is very different from Fan Chengda's poems. Even earlier, there were many texts writing about the suffering of farmers, such as Chao Cuo's so-called "Men working hard, not enough to provide grain, women spinning, not enough to provide clothes," "Poor people often wear the clothes of cattle and horses, and eat the food of dogs and pigs," and even more familiar, "Happy years end in hardship, and famine years cannot avoid death," which also shows the situation of Chinese farmers for thousands of years, which is completely opposite to the atmosphere of "spring rain is full, seedlings are new, the idle day is long, sleep with the yellow calf, watch the clouds to welcome the wheat field, snow piles of silkworm clusters..." (Xin Qiji's words). The situation in ancient times was like this, and the modern situation has only worsened. Phrases such as "rural bankruptcy" and "rural collapse" are also often heard and seen. The recent news of the suicide of a grain official in the mainland also shows that the average farmer is already like chaff that has been squeezed dry. Du Xunhe once had a poem about a widow, which impressed me the most: "Her husband died in battle to guard the weeds, her clothes were made of hemp and her temples were burnt, mulberry trees were abandoned but she still had to pay taxes, the fields were barren but she still had to collect seedlings, sometimes she picked wild vegetables and cooked them with the roots, and burned fresh firewood with leaves. No matter how deep in the mountains you are, you should have no way to avoid taxes and levies." Another poem from the Five Dynasties: "Sell new silk in February, and sell new grain in May, treat the sores in front of you, and cut out the flesh in your heart," which more fully describes the suffering of farmers. Today's newspapers can also often read communication articles about the lives of farmers, and the miserable situation is unbearable to read.</p>
<p>When a person's original views are overturned and denied by later views, he must feel that the first view was wrong and deeply hates it. Because I especially liked the poems of Fan Chengda and others when I was young, when I realized that I had been deceived by him, I was conversely particularly disgusted with these scholar-officials. They only relied on imagination and superficial observation, and then shook their pens and wrote some beautiful poems. After being exposed, apart from the beautiful shell, it was not worth anything!</p>
<p>Traveling is the most beneficial and enlightening thing. Society itself is a living book, and the knowledge in the book is waiting for readers to discover. If you don't pay attention to it at all times, study it in depth, and only take a quick look, you are really wasting the great spring light. On this spring day, when it is time to boat on the lake and climb to the top of the mountain, how many people think about the lives of boatmen, porters, farmers, and fishermen besides reading and sighing at the greatness and beauty of nature? It is no wonder that articles praising the natural scenery are numerous.</p>
<h3>The Greatness of the World</h3>
<p>— Yue</p>
<p>The largest musical instrument in the world is the "Apollonican," which was exhibited in London in 1817. This instrument has five sets of keyboards, played simultaneously by five people. The music produced is extremely complex, resembling the performance of a symphony orchestra.</p>
<p>There are currently twenty-nine companies in the United States actively producing wireless image transmitters, with a total of sixty-one different models. The smallest model can be placed on a desk and has a screen area of forty square inches, selling for US$169.50. The largest model comes with projection equipment and is specially designed for bars, schools, inns, and other places, with a screen area of twelve square feet, priced at approximately US$3,000.</p>
<p>The population of the British Empire was originally 566,660,000. After several territories were allowed to become independent in the past two years, the current population has been reduced to 145,700,000, which is not much different from the total population of the United States of 145,300,000.</p>
<h3>The Birth of the Jeep</h3>
<p>— Ying Min</p>
<p>Since Marshall took office as Chief of Staff, he has been extremely busy. Many inventions that are beneficial to the war have been reviewed by experts and then finalized by him.</p>
<p>Once, Major Schmidt of the General Staff pushed open the door and entered Marshall's office. He saw several commanders in a meeting with Marshall. Schmidt was about to withdraw when Marshall said, "Come in." He stopped the meeting and asked Schmidt, "What is it?"</p>
<p>Schmidt said that there was a guest outside who wanted to meet General Marshall. This person had been in Washington for several weeks. He had drawn a diagram of a small car and wanted to provide it to the government for testing. However, he had met many people, and everyone was not interested in his invention. In despair, he wanted to meet the Chief of Staff himself to make a final request.</p>
<p>Schmidt had already met with the person and seen his drawing. He believed that it was still worth researching and testing, so he said:</p>
<p>"General, I hope you can meet this person. He is outside."</p>
<p>Marshall asked one or two questions and then said, "Have you looked at his plan carefully?"</p>
<p>"Yes, General."</p>
<p>"What is your impression?"</p>
<p>"I think it makes some sense."</p>
<p>"Okay, I agree. You build one."</p>
<p>"But, General, one is not enough for testing. At least fifteen are needed."</p>
<p>"Major Schmidt, do you think we can afford this amount?"</p>
<p>"Yes, about twelve thousand dollars."</p>
<p>"Alright, then go do it."</p>
<p>This is the birth of the world-famous "Jeep." The entire discussion took no more than three minutes. (Translated from "Together," written by Mrs. Marshall, a biography of Marshall's life before he was sent to China.)</p>
<h3>I Also Ascended the Summit of Mount Tiantai</h3>
<p>— Jiang Danshu</p>
<p>Yesterday, I read Mr. Shi Shufan's poem about climbing the summit of Mount Tiantai, which could not help but evoke old dreams. I present two poems, depicting a different scene.</p>
<p>First poem:</p>
<p>Mother and calf yellow cattle know their way home,</p>
<p>Terraced fields seeded by heaven need no cart.</p>
<p>Carefree shepherd seeks fresh herbs,</p>
<p>Smiling, gifts me lilies.</p>
<p>Second poem:</p>
<p>Mount Tiantai is eight thousand zhang tall,</p>
<p>Floating Mount Sumeru in a sea of clouds.</p>
<p>Looking down, the peaks submit on all sides,</p>
<p>Shouting loudly, no echo returns.</p>
<p>The golden crow emerges, claiming the first dawn,</p>
<p>The jade rabbit's palace lingers in dampness.</p>
<p>Most loved is the summer journey, autumn moon order,</p>
<p>Only worried about dried meat and wine being rejected by the monk's kitchen. (Reply)</p>
<h3>The Untrammeled Flower</h3>
<p>— Chen Shengyan</p>
<p>Chapter Twelve: A Chance Encounter (95)</p>
<p>When Qi Wan saw Wu Yun talking, his eyes seemed to contain a suction, contracting and expanding, more beautiful than any man. But Wu Yun used his eloquent tongue, speaking eloquently. Qi Wan listened to him while quietly watching his beautiful divine light. She felt as if she was falling into a cloud, until the servant came in and told Dao Yun that there was a phone call for him. Only then did Dao Yun leave Qi Wan's room. Qi Wan, feeling extremely bored, was so persuaded by Wu Yun that her thoughts could not help but sway. She lay on the bed alone and thought for a while, feeling that what Niao Yun said was not without reason. To find a way out, of course, Shanghai was the best. Dao was in Shanghai for many years and was familiar with everything. What he said was of course reliable. At the same time, she thought that Niao Yun was originally the son of a wealthy family, no wonder his words and actions were so generous and natural. He said that he wanted to organize a film company, which shows that his financial resources were very abundant, and such talents are very rare. Seeing his words implying admiration for me, all the words were reserved. Since Beiping cannot stand, and Zhu Zhai cannot be combined, why should I make myself suffer? I should find my own way. Last time, I was angry for a while and wanted to provoke Zhu Zhai. I did not examine it carefully, and met Director Miao, which led to a big mistake and a joke. Now, in order to avoid meeting with colleagues, it is best to go far away. I can't ignore such a handsome man in front of me. Qi Wan was thinking wildly in the room, and she really wanted to go to Niao Yun's room to talk to him again, but she felt that it was not very convenient. It is better to wait and see. If he really pays attention to me, he will definitely come again. That day, she waited until the afternoon, but Niao Yun did not show up. She couldn't help but go to Niao Yun's sick room to inquire, but Dao Yun was not in the room. According to the nurse, Mr. Liu went out on business in the morning and has not returned. Qi Wan asked, "What disease does Mr. Liu have?" The nurse said, "He has hemorrhoids, which are now cured. He will probably be discharged from the hospital in a few days." Qi Wan listened, (and did not say anything, but returned to her room, sat in a stuffy mood for a while, and always felt that there was a question in her heart that had not been resolved, so she walked out of the house again, pacing on the corridor for a long time, watching the setting sun had fallen, and the afterglow hung on the treetops, and a few crows were perched on the branches, croaking. Qi Wan heard the sound of the crows, and it seemed that all her moods were evoked. She leaned idiotically on the railing, staring blankly at the crows perched on the trees. After a while, the remaining light on the treetops gradually disappeared, and the crows on the branches also flew away in pairs, and twilight enveloped the earth. Qi Wan still stood idiotically on the corridor in a daze. At this moment, suddenly someone called out beside her, "Miss Gu!"</p>

<h3>Reader Consultation - Legal Interpretation - Inherently Naughty and Repeatedly Disobedient - Expel Adopted Son to Prevent Future Troubles</h3>
<p>Hu Jinfang asked: My late husband adopted a son from an orphanage when he was alive. When he was young, he could not study well, and when he grew up, he could not learn a craft. Now at the age of twenty, his behavior is bad. Last spring, he secretly took things out to sell and spent them wastefully. After finding him, he seemed to repent, so he forgave him. Recently, he relapsed, becoming even worse, frequenting brothels and approaching merchants to squander money. His nature is bad, and it pains me to say it. I also have a biological child of my own. I really have no way to deal with this bad adopted son. I ask your newspaper's legal experts to consider the situation and provide a solution for the aftermath, for which the living and the deceased will be grateful.</p>
<p>[Lawyer Jiang Pingfan's Answer] Since the adopted son is bad and not yet an adult, in fact, you can only discipline him at any time. Besides notifying all merchants not to engage in monetary transactions with him, there are no other legal remedies.</p>
<h3>Military Service Clarification (Answer from the Civil Affairs Bureau)</h3>
<p>(1) Answer to reader Jia Yuejun:</p>
<p>(1) All those who applied for rice approval in the 36th year will be included in the lottery, but whether or not to recruit will depend on the need.</p>
<p>(2) High school graduates are not subject to general conscription orders, which were promulgated and implemented in January of this year. According to the regulations that laws are not retroactive, it seems difficult to handle the deferment application for the 36th year by analogy.</p>
<p>(2) Answer to reader Lu Zhihong:</p>
<p>(1) Students studying in high school or above can apply for deferment according to the law.</p>
<p>(2) If you have graduated from a public teacher training school and are currently a primary school teacher for less than one year, or if you have graduated from a non-teacher training school and have passed the examination or have no examination and are currently a primary school teacher for more than one year, or if you have graduated from a teacher training or national higher school in the recovered provinces and cities during the enemy-puppet era, and have passed the qualification examination in accordance with the "Revised Examination Measures for Middle School Students in Recovered Areas" or the "Registration, Examination and Training Measures for Primary School Teachers in Recovered Counties and Cities," and are currently a primary school teacher for more than one year, you can be exempted from conscription during the pacification period in accordance with Article 26, Paragraph 1, Item 2 of the Military Service Law.</p>
<p>(3) Answer to reader Qi Tongxing:</p>
<p>(1) If Mr. Huang is indeed serving in a legal military institution and the service unit has issued a certificate of active duty, he can be exempted from conscription. There is no need for the chief officer to issue a certificate to apply for pacification. It is said that he has already left his job. If he has not gone through the legal discharge procedures, he should be regarded as having eliminated the reason and will still be included in the lottery for conscription.</p>
<p>(2) Those born in the 13th year of the Republic should be males of conscription age.</p>
<p>(3) According to Article 26, Paragraph 1, Item 4 of the Military Service Law, those who apply for sole responsibility for family livelihood must have a father who is 58 years old or older and is indeed the sole provider to be eligible for deferment.</p>
<p>(4) Those who applied for exemption from prohibited service and deferment of conscription in the 36th year will be included in the lottery this year, which means those males of conscription age who did not apply for exemption or deferment in the 36th year. The application for exemption from prohibited service and deferment of conscription this year is still pending.</p>
<h3>Shanghai and Old Culture</h3>
<p>Yesterday, I bought a set of Yijin's [name]'s "Handkerchief and Letter" [style of calligraphy] from a book stall in Liulichang. The binding is exquisite. The last book's tail note reads "Printed by Dianshizhai, Shanghai in the Gengchen year of Guangxu [1880], issued by Shenbao Museum's Zhongchang Calligraphy and Painting Studio. Engraved on stone by Qian Yong of Jinkui in the Dingmao year of Jiaqing [1807]." I also saw two old novels with the note "Shenbao Museum edition" at the end. A friend said, "Northerners only know Shenbao as an old newspaper that publishes daily newspapers. Who knows that it also has many publications?" Gengchen is the sixth year of Guangxu in the Qing Dynasty. To the 29th year of the Republic of China is the second expansion, and now, in the 37th year, another eight years have passed, totaling seventy years. The Shenchang Calligraphy and Painting Studio had already been organized. If the number of its continued Sichuan editions [finely printed edition] were added up, it would be a grand sight to behold.</p>
<p>It makes me think that Shanghai, as an economic center and prosperous world, is praised as the London and New York of the East, while critics call it a cesspool of bad habits and filth. This does not need to be discussed in depth. However, Shanghai has made a very large and special contribution in the field of culture, which is generally overlooked. This matter must be recorded.</p>
<p>Shanghai's publishing industry can be divided into two major categories: "reviewing the old" and "fitting the times." "Fitting the times" means adapting to modern and current practical uses and spreading it at any time. For example, major bookstores target new education with teaching instruments, supplies for schools at all levels, and "spiritual food" for all aspects of society. Major newspapers' editing, printing, and operations are large in scale, all a few steps ahead of the inland. No matter Nanjing or Beijing, which cultural figures do not regard Shanghai as a source of supply? This is a common fact for a hundred years and does not need to be repeated. As for "reviewing the old," it means using new methods to reproduce old books, rubbings of steles, versions of calligraphy, etc. The printing is exquisite and the output is rich, glorifying the national essence, praising the predecessors, and benefiting future generations. Its great achievements and practical effects are unmatched by any other place in the country, and it can even be called the cultural center.</p>
<p>As the ancients said, writing books and establishing theories is something that scholars should do, but writing is not easy, and it cannot be guaranteed that it can be passed down. Therefore, it is better to "engrave books," focusing on the excellent works of predecessors and widely spreading them. This is a contribution to the literary world, and one's own name is also attached to the tail to be displayed. This theory is extremely practical. However, old-fashioned book engraving is not an easy task. It is not as convenient and agile as new-fashioned lithography, letterpress printing, photographic printing, collotype, and new imitations of Song, and various versions of the Juzhen edition, which are also precise and beautiful. This is a gift of science and the grace of the times, which the old gentlemen of the past could not have imagined.</p>
<p>The development of culture is closely and necessarily related to the progress of printing technology. Shanghai is the first gateway to China and the West. Civilized tools naturally have the priority of acceptance. People from Jiangnan are quick to act and most have the spirit of "doing." They do things as soon as they see them. With these advantages (geographical, temporal, and personal), the old thread-bound books and old-fashioned engraved editions, whether they were outdated, cumbersome, secret, or rare, were rescued batch by batch by the Shanghai printing and publishing industry. The rubbings of steles and calligraphy by Dianshizhai, Guoguangshe, and Youzheng Bookstore, and the notes and novels by Saoye Shanfang, are neatly and clearly printed, more eye-catching than the old woodcuts. The layout is uniform and suitable for viewing, and it is also better than the "soft, dim, scattered, and uneven" of the old editions. Other libraries, bookstores, and newspaper offices with good printing all meticulously print old books, or search for secret or unique copies, so that they can see the light of day again and be made public to the world. Or they will sort out the books that are commonly seen but clumsy and expensive, and turn them into products that are beautiful and cheap. They are all meritorious officials of the old culture.</p>
<p>In the old capital, from thirty or forty years ago, the books in the book market were mostly published in Shanghai, both new books and old books (reprinted). For example, the old "Tongwen," old "Hongwen," and "Guangbai Song" illustrated old novels, with their exquisite and clear fonts, clean and elegant paper, and elegant and beautiful illustrations, can all be described as "heart, energy, and fruit" [product of one's entire being]. They occupy a very large value in the history of Chinese art and are truly empowered by Western printing. In the Guangxu and Xuantong periods of the former Qing Dynasty, the old "Tongwen" embroidered image novels were regarded as rare books in the Beijing market and priced according to antique market prices. In the past ten years, even at the new Zhengyangdian fairs, Tongwen novels have not been seen. Even one or two incomplete copies are priced extremely high, as they are already rare treasures.</p>
<p>Recently, most of the woodcut thread-bound books have been bought and sold by the catty as waste paper (some are used for wrapping goods, and some are used as raw materials for making new paper). Commentators think it is a pity and even pessimistic about the old culture. Although there are considerable reasons, after an actual investigation, the survival of the fittest and natural selection are inevitable. Speaking from my own experience, the old books in my family are piled on the shelves, covered with dust, and have not been touched for many years. Because everything is valuable for its use. To browse these old books, you have to use both hands to pick them up, and they take up a lot of space on the table. After reading one side, there is not much content, and you have to turn the page again, which is time-consuming and cumbersome. It is not as clear and convenient as the new-style reprinted products published in Shanghai (of course, it refers to the editions of "Tongwen" and "Saoye," not the inferior products with thin paper, small characters, and secret copies). It is clear and convenient, and the result is twice the work with half the effort. Therefore, during the enemy-puppet period, due to the need for money to exchange for rice, many old books on the shelves were sold. Some friends discouraged or lamented, and I smiled and said: "It is also waste to leave them on the shelves." Of the 20% that were retained, there are Song and Ming editions, two Qing Dynasty large-character editions, and a small number of exquisitely engraved editions, which have been reorganized and are still stored on the shelves, but they are only regarded as antiques and have nothing to do with culture. I read the Old Can's Travels and wanted to see the book collection of Yang Mansion in Dongchang Temple but could not (the book changed "Yang" to "Liu" surname, which is an example of novels). He wrote a poem with the sigh of "Deeply locked in the Langhuan, the bookworms are full." However, the wealth of book collections such as the Qing Dynasty's internal government, the great library of the palace, and the books filling the building, have been sealed for many years. Not only are there bookworms and spider webs, but it is also rumored to be the cave of fox fairies and snake gods. Even if relatives and ministers want to open and view one or two, the guards will change color and tell them, almost like the demons suppressed on the mountain by Zhang Tianshi in the Water Margin. May I ask, even if it is the Zhou, Qin, Han, and Wei dynasties, with characters as big as a dipper and books as big as boats, what does it have to do with culture? When I read the Old Can's Travels, if I were in the position of Liu Mansion, I would definitely refuse Old Can to visit, and tell him that it is not because I am hoarding and selfish, but because it takes half a day to fuss and gets you dirty, and you can't read a few chapters and pages, and you can't gain much knowledge. As a result, there are only a few false and good-looking doors in the travel notes.</p>
<p>Another example is the "Complete Library of the Four Treasuries" of the Qing Dynasty. When Xu Shichang was president, he issued a clear order to send Zhu Qiqian to handle the printing by a certain large library, but it did not materialize. Later, Zhang Xueliang also had this idea, which can be regarded as admiring elegance, but the work is troublesome and costly, and it is difficult to print and sell. This is all worrying for nothing and disturbing yourself. It is better for Shanghai's bookstores, newspaper offices, and printing houses to print many old books throughout the country without fanfare or publicity, which is a practical contribution to culture.</p>
