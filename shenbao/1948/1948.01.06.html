<p>〔路透社華盛頓五日電〕杜魯門總統將於本屆國會揭幕時所提之咨文中，提出總額三億元之援華計劃。</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕紐約五日廣播：華盛頓訊，國務院刻正草擬一新的援華計劃，預料將要求國會至少以數億美元援助中國。</p>
<p>〔本報南京五日電〕美國會將於六日開幕，國務院行將提出之具體援華方案爲此次會議主要議題之一。我國應邀派遣赴美之技術顧問團，已決定由兪大維。貝祖詒兩氏及隨員交部秘書鄧振緒，財部秘書陳人倫等五人組成，連日來各有關政府機關如財部，交部及央行等均忙碌異常。主管人負且多加夜班爲兪等一行準備需用資料，其主要者爲我國金融。經濟。交通。軍事之一般現狀，尤重財政收支之不敷及應付困難。兪氏等或將列席美國國會，以備於硏究援華方案時，提出谷種報吿並答覆諮詢，俾使掌理美國財權之國會，對我國情况，能自直接供給之材料中得更詳盡之了解。兪貝兩氏行期在邇，連日倍見忙碌。王外長五日午曾於私邸宴兪貝及兪鴻鈞。張嘉璈。甘乃光等，席問對美暖有關事項，廣泛交換意見。下午四時半，兪氏應召晋謁蔣主席有所請示。據確息：貝氏定六日離京返滬，檢覈央行方面準備之資料，並摒擋行裝。兪氏亦定八日赴滬，與同行者會齊後飛美。兪氏留美期間預計四週，屆時貝氏是否同時返國，尙未決定。</p>

<p>〔本報南京五日電〕外部證實：蘇聯外長莫洛托夫答覆我國上月五日提出關於對日和約準備會議主張之照會之覆文，業於本月二日晚由蘇駐華大使館送達我外部。外部拒絕發表官方今後應付僵局所可能採取之態度。據關係方面人士分析，和約之準備工作，不必過於悲觀，蓋蘇聯此次覆文中除關於和會表決時否決權之保留未予提及，顯仍與我國採取一致之態度外，並曾爲四大國以外之其他國家着想，採取曾經倫敦外長會議同意之設立小組委會延攬各國參加之辦法。此一主張顯示蘇聯對和會之召開並非全然漠不關心，今後之發展將仍視我國之努力及美國之耐心以爲斷。</p>

<p>合衆社記者向著名反對國民黨觀點之中國人士七名提出此問題，其中一致譴責馮氏，一人拒絕發表意見，餘一人則爲「基督將軍」辯護。</p>
<p>七人中有兩人爲大學敎授，兩人爲大學生，兩人爲職業界人士，一人爲商人。一大學生自稱絕非親共份子，認爲在民主政治下，政府官負不論在國內外，均有權自由說話，故渠認馮氏無不當之舉動。敎授之一則稱，對馮氏反國民黨之演詞及文章，「旣不譴責，亦不贊許」。</p>
<p>其他五人，包括前民主同盟盟員兩人，及猛烈抨擊國民黨之其他三人，一致構馮氏「缺乏愛國心」。衆均認馮氏缺少爲人之道德，蓋利用考察團在外國攻擊政府也。</p>

<h3 id="c20">中港協定局部實施以後 <a href="#c20" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e20" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">20</a></h3>
<p>中港金融協定已正式宣佈，於昨日起實施。此項協定於去年七月間即開始磋商，於次月十五日，即行簽訂，原定八月十八日雙方同時公佈。　以是十七日我國頒佈外匯管制新辦法，用法幣貶值的手段來爭取外匯，港方因此遲疑，一再延擱下來。至九月底，港督　量洪氏入都訪問，談判始行復活，屢傳已獲具體結果，且屢傳實施日期；但除十一月初，港方頒佈香港船貨駛往中國各口岸新條例，規定於是月五日起施行外，並無何等進展。因此外間頗多揣測，幾擬先項協定，已無形中宣告流產。</p>
<p>昨日起所施行的中港金融協定，不過原協定中之一部份，經港督在京衡定，先行付謠實施的。其中要點有二：即　我國主要出口貨如　，鎢，桐油，菜油，豬　，絀紗燈運港轉口，必須證明其所得外匯，已售與或訂明售與中國指定銀行；　港方禁止携帶法幣五百萬元以上的現鈔進出。該協定中雖同是規定：凡由港駛華的船隻，其實單必須經港政府加蓋給記，但這項辦法，已於去年十一月五日起實施，此次不過重言申明，故實際只得以上兩項。</p>
<p>但我們並不能低估此項協定局部實施的價值。因為土貨運港，其所得外匯，必須證明已售與或將售與中國指定銀行；這一項辦法，無擬地，將增加我國外匯的收入，和減少土貨走私的數量。其限制現鈔的進出，與加强銀錢業的管理，其於我國管制金融的辦法，當然亦不無小補。</p>
<p>不過局部實施，其效用當然亦只是局部的。就金融而論，以後如何取締資金逃避，僑購逃避，在此項協定中，並沒有明文規定。而且前年一年中，據估計，留在香港的僑　，約值港幣四億元，去年究有幾何，海沒有可靠的數字。這算外匯，雖經屢次折衝，協定中並沒有一字　及。這與我國吸收僑匯，充實外匯頭寸的類　，顯然相去很遠。好在如今所實施的協定，祗是一部份，希望在此後所擬繼續實施的部份內，能够注意及此。</p>
<p>貨物而論，所謂香港船貨駛往中國各口岸新條例，雖早經付諸實施，但港　一水之隔，海疆又港汶紛歧，無論陸路水路，其可以走私的道路，為数高不在少。單　港船貨加蓋給記的辦法，於緝私上，似乎海欠周密。而且照港方加給的辦法，其所緝之私，其沒收之貨，與其所處罰之　，皆在港方而不在我境內。他們於查得某船載有私貨之後，並沒有通知我國的條款。所以於我國並沒有甚麼利益；其處罰後的私貨，亦仍有二度三度偷運來　之可能。如此緝私，實錄不够徹底。</p>
<p>據最初消息，所謂中港協定，本有兩部份：一為經濟協定，一為關稅協定。此次所公佈實施的，不過經濟協定中的一部份。某中未公佈，未實施的，因為未經宣佈，究竟內容如何，無從加以懸揣。如果港方能從大處落　，將此項保留部份，一倂提前實施；相信於促進中港貿易，穩定彼此的經濟基礎上，必有更大的帮助。</p>
<p>其在我國，雖於此次局部實施的結果，於外匯的爭取，及走私的防止，未嘗不可收到相當的功效，但以外匯市價，與黑市相差尙遠，能否將進出口貨走私的漏洞，完全予以堵塞，實是疑問。我們認為此後吸收僑龍，與加强緝私這兩重工作，仍有卿及　及，切實改進的必要。</p>
<p>根本方法，除掉消極的防制而外，莫急欲積極的誘導；時人所倡的進出口聯鎖辦法，我們以為依舊值得考慮只須現行的進口管制繼續實施，則上項辦法實施之後，對於進口貨，無論在數量上，在種別上，俱沒有可以憂慮的地方；而出口貿易，却自此便可推動，出口外匯，亦可望有正當歸宿，其僑匯與海外存金，並可望於外貨進口的姿態下，重複流入國內。如果物資較充，原料與機械有所接濟，則生產事業不至日漸萎縮，而一般物價的漲風，亦或可稍形和緩。至於國家所需外匯頭寸的負担，從此較為輕鬆，尤其餘事。這與中港協定雖無直接關係，而於爭取外匯，防止走私的作用，要無二致；故連類而及之。</p>

<p>〔聯合社華盛頓四日電山杜魯門總統與共和黨控制之國會，對於當前三大問題現正嚴陣以待，民主共和兩黨於今年總統選舉年勢力之消長咸取決於此。三大問題即爲减稅，生活費用高漲及馬歇爾計劃。兩黨議員現已紛紛回京，準備出席本月七日開幕之第八十屆國會。各黨均將生活費用上漲一節互相歸罪對方。總統擬向國會提出咨文三件，七日先提出國務咨文，九日繼以經濟咨文，然後於十二日提出預算案，總數或將高達四百億元，打破和平時期之紀錄。</p>
<p>〔中央社華盛頓四日合衆電〕國會對馬歇爾計劃開始辯論時，首一問題，將集中於是否以馬歇爾本人或田獨立之商人控制錢袋之問題。杜魯門總統已請國會將擬議中一百七十億美元歐洲復原計劃之責任，加於由馬歇爾指揮及控制之管理人肩頭，但共和黨領袖如衆院議長馬丁及參議員塔虎脫則表示反對，主張一切對外貸款，應置於兩黨合作政府機構之手。塔虎脫稱：杜總統之計劃，將使用費機構事實上成爲國務院管轄下之一局。參院外委會民主黨參議員康納利認爲責任應完全操諸國務院之手，任何限制國務院職權之行動，將造成不幸。</p>

<p>〔本報衡陽三日航訊〕從桂林開始修起，四月間到了全州，所有七拼八湊的廢軌和金丹段拆移來的鋼軌，計算一下之後，還缺少六十公里始能到衡。粵漢路是劉備借荆州，借了去沒有還，經過交涉，始勉力湊了六十公里長的廢棄不用的舊廢軌。於是開始兩頭趕修。在此數月中，趕修的員工，有時用電燈照明，夜以繼日，湖南桂北，山地多瘴，再遭遇了兵災，積屍遍野，更滋助了疫癘的繁播。又因物價高漲，生活艱難，於是治安上也頗成問題。所以此綫在趕修期間，受疫癘和匪患，因公而死的，計員司四人，職工十三人。袁夢鴻局長於通車典禮中，報吿他們趕修時所遭遇的艱苦情形，一時感情衝動，竟至落淚，哽咽不能成聲。</p>

<p>因爲趕修的努力，提前一個月完成。經全州到衡陽二百三十公里，以七個月的時間完成鋪軌工作，平均每天鋪軌在十公里以上，這也就是聯總外藉人士嘆爲奇蹟的。因爲這種紀錄，似乎不是人力所能做到的。其實，湘桂路此次爲什麼一天能鋪軌十公里以上，並不是員工們有什麼特出的奇能；他們還是和常人一樣，所以有此次的新紀錄表現，不過是願意吃苦，他們夜以繼日，七個月做了四百天工，也就是一個人在同一時間做了兩個人的事。沒有什麼決覈，吃得苦而已矣。</p>

<p>湘桂路的困難不僅是復軌，除此還有機車和車廂等的缺乏。全部器材所需，沒有獲得外運來的一點幫助，都是靠就地自己想辦法，自力更生。棄置道旁的廢機車，把它修整起來；僅剩軀殻已不爲人所重視的車輛，把它重新裝置起來。此次舉行通車紀念的專車，共掛頭等臥車十輛，均是湘桂黔路蘇橋機廠十一月出廠的新車廂。據該廠廠長谷楫語記者，除玻璃一項是購自香港外，其他都是就地取材，自製的作品。記者所乘的一輛，雖是低鈎，缺少鋼版，不免有些震動，但其他一切設備，並不亞於國外輸入來的。不識貨貨比貨，眼前粵漢路的頭等臥車，其設備就要比較差些。此種工作表現，說明中國人是有能力「自力更生」的。友邦人士批評我們事事仰賴外人。湘桂路修復通車的經過，是給予此種批評的一個最有力的事實答辯。這條大動脈在過去她肩負了溝通西南經濟文化的重任，於軍事經濟盡了莫大的貢獻。今後她同樣的担任起這個重大的使命來。我們預祝不久的將來，她的右臂一定如左臂一樣的活絡起來，明年能够通車貴陽。還有那麼一天，她的踏在鎭南關和伸進廣州灣的兩條腿，也能站立起來。（特派員黃潮如）</p>

<p>— 仲理</p>
<p>血崩者，經來過多，如問之崩潰，不可遏制，後即淋漓不斷，故每崩漏並稱，亦有始　而後崩者，原因率爲子宮充血，或內部生瘤，卵巢變質，或子宮癌等，崩後每見面色慘白，頭暈月花，腰痠如折，四肢痿軟，失眠心跳等症，壯年婦女病此爲多，靑年女子偶有見之，則因劇烈運動或跌仆損傷而致，五句左右病比，多屬子宮瘤或癌之預兆，不可不察。</p>
<p>中醫治療血崩，每詳察其病而施治，故見效甚著，約可分六點，（一）衝任不能攝血者，症見畏泠唇爪不榮，宜急投入參黃芪阿膠艾葉等，（二）腎腸虛不能歛血者，症見腰痠足冷，心悸恍惚，治宜溫腎塡精，如鹿茸河車（即胎盤）蓯蓉紫石英之類，（三）血虧肝旺者，症見面白唇紅顴赤舌綘，血鮮帶紫，藥用生地白芍母皮地榆鱉甲牡礪等品，（四）氣虛不能歛血者，宜用黨參黃芪杜仲桂圓肉類，（五）脾虛不能統血者，前方更加於朮木香，（六）宿瘀內阻，新血不能歸經者，可用當歸炭丹參炭　金炭苦參炭等，對症用藥，無不應騐。崩漏愈後，值此冬令，尤宜服膏方調補，亡羊補牢，未爲晚也。</p>

<p>— 朱仁康</p>
<p>語云，「疔瘡雖小，其毒甚橫」，確爲外症內最具有危險性者，發於面部及手部居多，初起小瘡，或癢或痛，切勿以小而忽之，若感麻木者更重。</p>
<p>發於顏面之疔瘡，如鼻疔，人中，鎖口，顴骨，尤較危險，此等疔瘡，與飲食中毒大有關係，如食病死豬肉牛肉，或終日酒肉　逐，每易發疔瘡，患疔瘡後復不愼酒食，當易肇走黃之危險，故治療愈早愈好。</p>
<p>手部及指部疔瘡，如蛇頭，托盤，虎口，因手部知覺神經密佈，故疼痛特甚，芳以手爲職業者，宰豬者，捉魚人，農夫，洗衣女傭，皮匠，縫工，水木作，廚子，多患疔瘡，普通人則以手指刺傷，軋傷等誘起。</p>
<p>疔瘡與氣候大有關係，如天久不雨，天乾亢熱，多患疔瘡，小兒遇天燥時，喜用舌舐唇，足以發生反　疔。</p>
<p>際此冬季，喜闡爐取煖，經濟者或以煤球爐，或多近煤氣，均有火毒，因此而患疔來求診治者頗不少，是亟應加以注意者也。</p>

<p>— 管理平</p>
<p>冬溫即傷寒的一種，因爲要符合時令的關係，故稱之爲冬溫，冬溫初起與普通外感相同，形寒憎熱，頭疼身痛，骨節痠楚，咳嗽痰稠，胸脇隱痛等證，因爲有內伏的因素關係，往往非發汗可解，或一下可愈，調治得法，輕則二三候（每一星期稱一候）而　退，重則五六候而方愈，此種溫病決不是　進發汗　即可退熱的，或者有汗後，熱略見減退，移時即又增高矣。</p>
<p>冬溫病變症極多，（一）轉爲肺炎者，症見咳嗽痰升，氣息喘逆，右脇或左脇疼痛，或痰內帶紅，治宜葶　，石膏，銀花，連翹，花粉，沙參，廬根，枇杷葉露等淸潤之。（二）轉爲腸出血者，血出多而神識不淸，宜用犀角，鮮生地，丹皮，白頭翁，秦皮，槐花炭以淸之，倘見肢冷汗多，脈細或伏，面色晄白，氣息微續者，易致虛脫，須加人參，龍骨，牡蠣，以扶正救脫。亦有血出不多，色帶紫黝，血後神情如常，或先見腹痛，血後痛即輕減者，與上述者不同，只須淸腸足矣。</p>
<p>（三）兼腹膜炎者，最爲危候，小腹疼痛甚劇，大便或行或結，重者小腹隆起，宜以大黃，牡丹皮，桃仁，敗　草，以行瘀去結。</p>
<p>（四）轉爲神識昏糊，　語妄言者，藥以至　丹，柴　丹，神犀丹，菖蒲，阳星等選用。</p>
<p>（五）轉爲動風　厥，兩目上視，牙關緊閉，宜用羚羊，石決明，鈎籐等治之。</p>

<p>— 程國樹</p>
<p>反胃與噎膈，同屬消化器病，反胃較輕而噎膈重，世稱『瘋癆臌膈』爲四大症，噎膈爲四症之一，其嚴重目知。</p>
<p>『反胃』病尙能食，但食後不久或稍久仍然嘔出，更可別爲食後即吐及朝食暮吐或暮食朝吐兩種，食後即吐者，因胃之上口（即賁門），發生痙攣，狹窄，　腫等，食物不能下胃而仍吐出，朝食暮吐或暮食朝吐者，乃胃之下口（即幽門），發生上述諸種病理，食物在胃內，不能下入十一指腸，故　留較久，方始吐出，本病患者雖然能食，而不　其中營養，體力日衰，故宜與服牛乳等流動性食物，如韮汗牛乳飲（韮汁，牛乳，稍和姜汁）。</p>
<p>初起　其体力未　，食入即吐者，宜大黄甘草湯（大黄，甘草），朝食暮吐或暮食朝吐者，宜吳茱萸湯（吳萸，人参，生姜，大棗）。</p>
<p>『噎膈』俗名隔氣，實則噎與膈，亦有分別，噎者，乃食管狹窄枯細，食　不下，食物噎住不能嚥下，膈者，食管中確有障害物，如食管憇窒，或有癌腫，食物不能通過。</p>
<p>此等病者，每因平時憂思恚怒所造成，湯水可飲，食物難下，與反胃之食入反出者，稍有不同，至於治法，因氣　　結而成者，宜四　飲（人參，烏藥，檳榔，沉香）以行氣開結，兼津液枯者，加入五汁飲（牛乳，韮汁，姜汁，藕汁，梨汁）以生津養液，（或用滋養灌腸法）津枯氣結痰凝而成者，宜大半夏湯（人參，半夏，白蜜）以行氣豁痰生津，氣結血瘀而成者，宜桃仁承氣湯（桃仁，大黃，芒硝，甘草，桂枝）以袪瘀破結，按中醫古藉雖無癌腫之說法，但用袪瘀之法以治癌腫，頗爲吻合也。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕六區棉紡公會昨為實施花紗布管理辦法一案。召問臨時會員大會，到各廠代表百餘人，由理事長王啟宇主席，對於政府公佈管理辦法九條，有詳為討論。該會發表意見大要如次；在政府掌握物資，平仰物價之政策下，實施全國花紗布管理辦法。凡我同業自應共同擁護。蔣主席元旦安定金融增進生產之昭吿，尤為我同業一致仰戴。但管理辦法，必須顧到事業生存，庶可以顧利推行，而收安定增進之效。諸如：萬一原棉供應脫節，而引起之停工問題。工繳以花價計算問題。以花易紗時間問題。及其設備優劣問題等等。均與各廠發生深切關係。如不考慮週詳，據予實施，恐事實上將有困難。大會決讓分別組幾原棉紗布兩小組委員會，詳加檢討，日內即將書面意見，提供紗官會採擇。此次大會延續三小時之久，發言者頗為蹉跎，各會員咸表示頗與紗官會誠意合作，以達增進生產之日的云。</p>

<p>「新民」原作「親民」，程子謂「親」當作「新」，朱子章句從之，蓋緣大學一篇，自首至「其所薄者厚未之有也」，朱子所謂經者，顯係全篇綱領，以下，朱子所析以爲傳者，莫不於經引其端，於此竟英緒焉。篇中有論新民一段，（即朱子章句傳之二章）而「新民」二字獨不見於前之總段，（即朱子章句之經）可知總段中「親民」之「親」乃　與「新」形音相近，而致傳寫舛誤耳。至若陽明所謂「作新民之新，是自新之民，與新民之新不同此豈足爲據」云云，殊不知新民之新正存自新之義。夫新民云者，人君自明其德，然後推己及人，使有以其民亦各自明其德之謂也。所謂明明德於天下者，使天下之人皆有以自明其明德，故引康浩，太甲典云云，（朱子草句傳之一章）則繼之曰「皆自明也」。「自明」猶自新也。當論大學之明明德，即中庸率性之事，新民則修道之功。修道云者，人君使民自修其道，以復其性分之自然。是乃敎之眞義。人君敎民，非自外鑠之也，先修乎己，然後其在己者充，發於外而民爲之動，莫不興起而各從事於自修也。孔子曰；「爲政以德，譬如北辰，居其所，而衆星共之」，（論語爲政篇），斯言正可與此相發明也。陽明又曰：「下面論治國平天下處，皆於新字無發人樂其樂而利其利」；「如保赤子」；「民之所好好之，民之所惡惡之，此之所謂民之父母」之類，皆是親字意」。試問治平非新民之事而何？必有以致其民之自新，然後國乃治，天下乃平耳；其民未能自新，即强以政刑道而齊之，雖倖致於治平，殆亦不能久已。至若陽明所引賢賢，親親，保赤，……之類，謂皆「親」字之意，余曰，豈不然乎？蓋新民即敎民之事，敎民重以德化；人君化民之德唯仁，而行仁之方，搶親民莫由。今夫治平者新民之事，新民者敎民之功，然則論治平而標親民之義，固不宜乎？要而言之，新民，為冶之志；親民，爲治之方；親民所以新民，新民乃親民之效。故曰，從程子「親民」讀作「新民」，則其義長，而親民之意亦在其巾。然則朱王之爭，皆所謂莫須有者矣</p>
<p>至善者，萬事萬物之至道定理，中　所謂「誠」者是已。人之思慮云爲見於處事接物，莫不準乎至道定理，而無過與不及之弊，則謂之「中庸」明德之功，於知，則識此道理者，知也；於行，則所以體騐此道理者，仁也，所以推行此道理者，勇也。然則明德云者，明其性內知仁勇之德，使之有以識夫天地之至道定理，而以思慮云爲凖之也。推理爲所當止之域。此所當止之域，雖分見爲「衆理」「萬事」而其至道定理則一而已。一者非他，天地間一貫之道，即中庸所謂「其爲物不貳」者也。</p>
<h3 id="c108">都巿環境與罪犯行為 <a href="#c108" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e108" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">108</a></h3>
<p>— 方正</p>
<p>過去的刑罰學家大都傾向於先天罪犯型的理論，如Lombroso之罪犯型說，或Tredgold之先天道德缺乏論。近來社會學者的看法有了大轉變，關於環境的勢力，逐漸看重。這也是由於人境學（見本刊第二期張其昀先生一文）在思想史上逐漸抬頭的緣故。</p>
<p>自一九二五年Burgess的「城市」的專著出版以來，都市環境學Urban　Ecolog的硏究　起雲集。都市的人口流動甚多，從鄕下來的人，最初來也許窮無立錐之地，擠在貧民窟中，勤儉所得，經濟地位逐漸改良，住處也隨着而變動，也許二三十年，也許一代二代，這樣的人或竟由於社會的階梯底層爬到頂上去了。結果，本質還是這些人，祇是先後環境不大同·這種材料最便於環境勢力的硏究，因爲在如此情形下，遺傳因素可視爲持恒的。社會學家C.R.Shaw和他的一派學者便在芝加　進行了一個關於罪犯與都市環境的研究。</p>
<p>他們先將芝加哥全城劃成若干區，然後根據警察刑庭的紀錄——九二四三個靑年罪犯——分析他們的出身分配情形。結果是貧民竄（靠近城中心）的百分比最高，市郊區最低，而中間地帶則有規則地逐漸减低。這種很規則的地區分配不得不使人相信環境對於罪犯行爲很有關係。但可能的解釋仍不必盡爲環境決定論。因爲這種分佈情形很可能是先天的，即本來心理不健全，智力低下的便都集中於貧民窟一帶，所謂「物以類聚」，相同的不健全型先聚集於下流地帶，而非下流地帶使該地的居民變成下流。到底誰是因誰是果便不得不先加研究。</p>
<p>Tulchin在其一九三九年著的「智力與罪犯」一書，證明犯罪的人並不比其同一環境下的守法者的智力要低些，而Dunham更證明罪犯的心理並不比一般人不健全些。此外，尙有許多硏究結論都指向罪犯的心理都很偪近常態的。再者，同一種族的人，在貧民區的罪犯就多，搬出以後，越遠則罪犯的百分比也越少。這眞是「在山泉水淸，出山泉水濁。」泉水的淸濁與水本身有甚麼關係？</p>
<p>我們如果問爲甚麼在鬧市中，罪犯率要些？在鄕村中便要低些？城市物質生活的誘惑固然是一個重要原因，但社會組織的解紐或者是一個更重要的癥結。在一個小市鎭或鄕村，每一個人好像與全社團都有密切的聯系，眞是「出人相助，守望相扶」，個人的休戚也是大家的休戚。一個人踏進大城市後，他沒有這些牽連了，他好像是孤零零的一員。因此，在鄉間，社幽的力量會使他的行爲有社會性；，在「斷梗　萍」的大都市中，社團的力量不再親切地存在，他便敢於胡作胡爲而無所顧忌。換言之，在小地方，一個人尙顧面子，尙顧慮社會的指摘；在大都市，他的面子沒有人尊重，他便不怕社會的批評了。不然，都市的警察力量遠勝過鄕村，何以都市的罪犯比鄕付還多？</p>
<p>再則在大城市中，風俗與習慣力　的解體也是一個重要原因。在大都巿，特別是貧民　集的區域，四方八處的人，五方雜處，彼處有不同的風俗，有不同的習慣。標準的懸殊，使各人對於素習的傳統道德發生疑問。道德的混亂，倫理的失去準則，使許多人是非莫明，善惡不辟。這自然促成犯罪的行爲。再加上耳濡目染的多是犯罪行爲，原已失去主張的人，便更容易走上歧途中去。何以在這藏汚納垢的區域中，更不少藉此歛財的，竟組織一些犯罪的帮黨，有計劃地敎育並助長這些犯罪行爲呢？</p>
<p>這也不是大不可解的一回事，爲甚麼人口越集中，社會意識越麻木。在一個小地方住的人，睦　是一種美德，所以街坊　舍便如親戚一般的關切。但一個住在紐約或上海公　中的人，對於　　也就陌生。一方面這固然由於都市人口的流動力大，一方面由於社會刺激之過於頻繁，因而社會意識反而麻木。所以一從密集的貧民窟到郊外住宅區，四隣來往的人減少，社會刺激稀疏，一個人反而對於隣舍的休戚感關懷，社會的集體意識增加，犯罪行爲也少了。所以除了模倣以外，社會意識是犯罪的一個重大原因，而這一切，又皆可以環境來解釋的。</p>
<h3 id="c109">霍金評個人主義 <a href="#c109" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e109" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">109</a></h3>
<p>— 立人</p>
<p>美哲霍金敎授（Prof　W.　E.　Hocking）對於個人主義　有事　討論，書名　「人主義的不朽原素」（The　La　ting　Elcmcnto　of　Individualiam）。關於個人主義的利弊，是書均有頗爲詳盡的叙述。最近　氏復在「哲學之比較研究之價値」（Valuc　of　the　Coniparative　Stndy　of　philo　ophy）一文中，有涉及個人主義的幾段話，很値得我們注意。茲特擇要介紹其說如下：</p>
<p>霍氏認爲個人主義之在西洋是一種口號。西洋人把個人主義視爲一種理想，且多少己結合於西洋的法律制度中。西洋人雖不敢說，他們已在事實上把個人視為神聖的，可是西洋的法律即建築在個人在法律前有相等權利的假定上。同時公民權利的系統以及民主政治，也即由這點推輪出來。不過，個人的相等權利，其基礎是個人相等的價値。西洋人是否在事實上以相等的（及「神聖的」）價値加諸每一個人呢？霍氏認為這就是問題之所在。由國人之批評西洋文化爲　偽的，便以此爲藉口。中國的批評者嘗說，西洋人到東方來的，每以個人的神聖權利自誇，但美國的街車公司每年殺死了不少人，而公司當局卻不肯在街車上設立安全樣杆，理由是設立這種欄杆　費用要比公司每年所出的賠　費爲多。可見實際上西洋人是把生命看作幾元幾角的。什麼個人「神聖性」，只是情感，而非原理。這種批評，霍氏沒有加以反駁，也就是默認了。</p>
<p>次则，霍氏認爲把個人視爲社會生活的絕對單位，視爲一切權利和權力之所在，這也和社會事實不相合。事實上，除個人權利外，尙有團體的權利。不承認團體的權利，實足以削弱國家的有機生活。故個人主義過度發展之結果，實際便破壞了團體的行動和情感的統一。個人權利的要求往往把公共義務之感忽略。這一點霍氏認爲也是値得考慮的。</p>
<p>霍氏上面的批評，第一點指明西洋的個人主義並沒有嚴格的認眞，即認眞把每一個人都視爲神坐的。第二點指明個人主義的流弊足以破壞團體或國家的共同生活。這兩種批評似乎都是今日談個人主義的人所當注意的。</p>
<h3 id="c110">審美底對象 <a href="#c110" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e110" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">110</a></h3>
<p>— 韓裕文</p>
<p>—鮑桑克底美學述要之三—</p>
<p>我們曾說，最簡單的審美經驗是一種愉悅　情感，或對於令人愉悅的東西所生之情。照這側意思說，凡能引起愉悅之情的東西都可以作爲審美底對象。從一塊簡單的石子，　　的流水的以至高雅的音樂，富麗的戲劇，莫非審美底對象。</p>
<p>但非一切偷悅的情感都是審美的。審美的情感必須是穩定的，或常住的；共同的，或可以分事，可以傳達的；並且相關於一個對象的。沒有對象的　快，不是審美的情感。同時，美感必須起於或寄於對象本身而不能寄於對象以外。例如一溪流水之所以爲審美底對象，乃在於視之悅目，聽之悅耳。牠底形色音響富下即是審美的心安住之處，其情奇託之所。牠便是目的而不是手段。假若不能對那溪流底本相發生美感，卻以爲牠能灌田，或洗浴才對牠發生興趣，那麼你這樂趣便是實用的，而非審美的了。</p>
<p>根據上面這三個原則來檢討審美底對象，就知道，食品或滋味所　的美感最少，試想，一盌飯或一盤菜，當你吃飽了的時候，你還吃着愉快嗎？這就是說飲食方面的樂趣不穩定。酒，比較可以玩味而其情亦不大穩定，並且太主觀，不好傳達。關於　　，牠必須能傳達一個表而之曲綫或樣式，帶有動的性質時才有夫感，否則也無情趣。一般地說，美感生於看和聽，形色和音調爲審美底主要對象。</p>
<p>這裏所謂形色音調等等，自然是審美的心中之表象，而不是離心獨立的實在或毫無形式的自然；因爲凡不能靜觀或表象的東西都無益於情感之實現，即不能成為審美底對象。同時，這表象是　觀的或想像的表象，而不是知識的現象。例如審美的形像，不僅僅是幾何學上空間的形像；審美的顏色和音調也不就是物理學上的顏色和聲音。科學所認識的對象是抽象的，機械的，量的關係，或死的物質的迹象。例如科學上所認識的水是氫二　一，雲是空中的水汽，山是化礦物底堆積等等。審美的心雖也不必排斥這些迹象，卻能透過這些迹象而達其神髓；如於水則見其　動活潑，凝而不滯；於雲則見其脫然離繫，怡然自得；於山則見其莊嚴雄威，止而常新等等，舉凡一草一石，莫非天機之流露，生命之表現，深情之所寄。這才是審美底眞正對象。　是靜觀底表象，但是如實如救，　體完整的表象。牠是主客底合一體，神形渾然，而理情昭著。他是超乎許通听　　然或實在的物如。一切世俗的知識，如應史的記載，因果的說明，成分的解析，市價的估計，對於牠都是不相干的。</p>
<h3 id="c111">由數學到哲學 <a href="#c111" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e111" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">111</a></h3>
<p>— 謝幼偉</p>
<p>—羅素自述之二—</p>
<p>英哲羅素（Bertrand　Russell）的童年，我們已在前文　（本刋第三期）叙述過。這一位當代大思想家首先是硏究數學的。他怎樣從數學轉到哲學，及其哲學思想上的轉變，他自己都有頗爲詳細的自述。茲再根據他的自述，來加以介紹。</p>
<p>羅素到劍橋大學之後，他的生活大大的改變。他發現了很多可以談學問的朋友。他和許多志趣相同的朋友時時聚首談天。每星期六晚上，他們往往談到深夜。第二天星期，他們共同早餐之後，又作竟日的散步。他們什麼都談，除本人所學外，詩，哲學，政治，倫理，也是談話的資料。那時候他們覺得「這世界似乎是堅實而有希望的。」他們都深信十九世紀的進步可以繼續，而他們自身也各能作有價値的貢獻。羅氏認爲該一時期的快樂，是一九一四年大戰之後的靑年所不能想像的。著「　厚學原理」（Principia　Mathematica）的懷黑德氏（A.N.Whitehcad）。懷氏比羅氏的年齡大一些，羅氏進劍橋的時候，懷氏已做硏究員和講師。二是以硏究黑格爾哲學著名的麥泰迦氏（McTaggart）。三是以　斥唯心論著名的摩耳氏（G.EMoore）。此外，曾合釋柏拉圖的「共和國」的台維斯氏（Davasa）兄弟，及一位數家家桑格爾氏（Charles　Sanger）是他過從很密的朋友。</p>
<p>羅素在劍橋的四年　畫的時間內，首先的三年，他說他是硏究數學的。他的全部精神都美中在數學上，沒有工夫來讀哲學的書籍。到了第四年，他才開始硏究哲學。那時候敎他讀哲學的先生有三位：一是以「倫理學方法」（The　Methods　of　Ethics）一書著名的席其維克氏（HenrySicg　ick），他代表英國哲學的觀點。二是華特氏（JamesWard），他提出康德的系統，且介紹羅氏讀勞茲氏（Lotze）和西華特氏（Sigwart）的書。三是司托特氏（G.F.Stout），他很贊美柏烈得萊（F.H.Bradley），認為柏氏「現象與實在」（Appearance　nce　and　Reality）一書是在本體上做了人類所能爲的工作。他讀了一年哲學，但他並沒有決定專門硏究哲學。他於一八九四年離開劍橋。離開劍橋之後，他曾做過好月英國駐巴黎大使館的隨員。他不滿意這種工作，旋即辭職。辭職後，他結婚。結婚後，差不多有一年的時間他住在柏林，硏究經濟學和德國的社會民主思想。以後，他曾到美國去旅行。旅行回國，他即閉戶讀書，日讀數學和哲學，夜間則高聲朗誦歷史。</p>
<p>羅氏十一歲即和數學發生關係，在劍橋也以硏究數學的時間為多，為什麽他會從數學轉到哲學呢？根據他的自述，似乎有兩種理由：一是他發覺他自己有充分的能力可以硏究哲學。他提出作為硏究員獎金的論文，關於論幾何學的基礎的，極為華特氏及懷黑德氏所稱美。他說，不是他們的獎勵，他會硏究經濟學而不硏究哲學。二是他首先得到在大學講授哲學的機會。在一九九八年本來應在劍橋大學講授萊布尼茲哲壓的麥泰迦氏，因爲要到紐西蘭去省親，他就請羅氏來代授這一門功課。羅氏答應了。講完之後，他便　了一本「萊布尼茲之哲學」（philosophy　of　Leibniz,　1900）一書，這一本件，他認爲對於他是幸遝，不是這樣，也許他不會專門硏究哲學。</p>
<p>關於哲學上的主張，他首先是傾向唯心論的。在劍橋讀書的時候，他的思想很受麥泰迦和司托特二人的影響。麥氏介紹他硏究里格爾的哲學。他促使他相信英國的經騐論是粗淺的，而黑氏哲學的深入，則爲洛克，巴克萊，休謨及穆勒諸人所不及。司氏則促使硏究柏烈得萊的哲學。這時候他可說是一位黑務爾　派的信徒。他自讀在一八九四年的一天，他在劍橋大學的三一略上行走，忽然靈光一瞥，他覺得「本體論證」（Ontological　argument）是正確的。他出外買一罐烟絲，回來的時候，他把烟罐拋在空中，再接住呼喊起來說：「我的天呀！本體論證是對的。」他這時讀柏氏的書，讀得非常起勁。在現代哲人中，柏氏是他最崇拜的一位。他這種唯心論的傾向，維特了好幾年，直到一八九八年才加以放棄。他所以放棄唯心論，主要原因是受摩耳氏的影響最大。摩耳氏和他一樣，也曾一度成爲黑格爾哲學的信徒。摩耳氏首先反抗唯心論，而羅氏便跟着他走。他們兩人在其時都不滿意於柏烈得萊的學說。柏氏認爲常識所相信的每一物都是現象，都不是實在。他們兩人卻走到另一極端，認為凡常識所假定為眞實的事物都是眞實的。他們甚至相信，即令沒有人看見，而草仍是綠的，太陽和星辰仍是存在的，且相信有多數永恒的柏拉圖的理型世界存在着。這樣，羅氏便從唯心論轉到新唯實論的陣營中去了。</p>
<p>我們都知道羅素在哲學上的貢獻似乎不在他的純粹哲學，而在他的數理邏輯。他和懷黑德合著的「數學原理」，不管有什麼缺陷，已成爲現代硏究數理邏輯的人的「聖經」。差不多研究數理邏輯的人，不讀是書，便沒有資格來談這一門學問。他在學術上的不朽，也許就在這一書。他爲什麼會有寫這一本書的計劃呢？　他的自述是這樣：在一九〇〇年的時候，他參加在巴黎舉行的世界哲學會議。在會議上，他會見意太利的數學家皮阿諾氏（peano）。他覺得皮氏及其徒的思想言論極爲確切。他請求皮氏把著作　他。皮氏給了他。他回去　心硏究，熟悉他的符號之後，便發現關於「關係（Relations）的新符號，他請求懷氏合作來寫「數學原理」這一書。懷氏答應了。這書的第一册，即在一九一〇年出版，由是便奠定了羅氏在學術上的地位。</p>

<p>— 勸募寒衣運動</p>
<p>靖文</p>
<p>最近上海學生界所發起的勸募寒衣運動，可說是民國三十六年度上海社會上最有意義的一件事。</p>
<p>平生最怕聽高蹈主義者的諭調。在這輩人看起來，救濟和施捨的工作是沒有甚麼意義的，因為救济和施捨並不能彌補現社會的畸形關係，慈善事業祗是一種社會病態罷了，你能救得盡全世界的窮人嗎？何况有許多乞丐是天生的「賤骨頭」，你給他們施捨祗是害他們罷了……</p>
<p>講理論，他們這種理論確是最透澈的了，但講人心，他們這種居心却是最可怕不過的。因為姑不問這種理論是否全對，但因理論而抹煞眼前的事實，對人間生活的慘像視若無睹，視人道行為為某種人的心理弱點，其居心又豈堪聞問！</p>
<p>人類最高貴的性格之一便是同情心。單是同情心也許解決不了根本問題，但较之一味高蹈空談而對現實無動於裏的人，富有同情心的人究竟對於現實社會的福祉有益得多了。</p>
<p>這一次上海學生發動的寒衣運動，以幾千幾萬件的舊棉衣也許解決不了數十萬窮人的長期生活問题，但較之高唱「朱門酒肉臭，路有凍死骨」，而對於在鄙巷中蘆蓆底下飢寒待斃的人類僅投以漠然一瞥的冷酷者，你又忍心說是全無意義嗎？</p>
<p>寒衣運動不僅給窮人的身體上帶來一些溫暖，而且也給了他們一些精神上的溫暖。許多人也許不自覺藏在自己身上的一份「心」早已給日常生活磨煉得硬化了。我們在鬧市中幾乎每天看到搶冷飯的活動，在冷僻的馬路上不時看見棄嬰或死屍。初到上海來的外國人看到這種現象無不感到驚異，但大多数上海人則早已視之為「年常舊規」，因為他們的「心」早給環境硬化了。</p>
<p>「心」的定義。除了生理上的一個心外，原很難下斷語。不過，將同情心當作心理精神上的一種高對表現看，大概是不會錯的。上海的學生以及帮助學生義務輸送寒衣的三輪車夫和黃包車夫，在這次自動為窮苦同胞徵募寒衣的行動中，就是表現了這種可貴德同情心。而更可貴的是，他們這一次的義舉，不僅使凍　者獲得若干實惠，就是對於學生們本身，也無異是修習了一課實騐社會學。</p>
<p>拉近某西報在一篇特寫中曾說本市學生們在這一次的寒衣運動中發見了一個「新世界」。這是對的。上海的學生們雖然也知道我們的社會中有着一大羣的窮人在，但畢竟窮到如何，窮到度着怎樣的生活，恐怕他們過去未必能深知，以為啃大餅油條渡日的人已算是窮到極點了。而現在他們却從「新世界」中發見更有以大餅油條為奢侈食品，以蘆蓆敗絮為「金屋」的窮人在！你能說這不是最實踐的社會學課程嗎？</p>
<p>知識份子往往有一個通病，就是能說而不能行，或說是怕行。尤其是我國的知識份子，一向給「讀書人」這一頂帽子壓得重重的，因此每在理論上愈趨極端，對現實生活上便愈隔離。中國的學生運動自五四以來雖然歷次想接觸現實社會，但又屢次為理論與主義的爭執給打了回去。這一次的學生徽募寒衣運動，雖然沒有歷次的學生運動轟動，不過却县有更實在的社會意義。因為它帮了一部份窮人得以勉渡寒凍，也帮助唤起了行將滅絕的人間同情心。</p>

<p>剛要過新年，忽然看到北平師範學院又被火焚的消息，不禁心中又沉了一下。雖然是十年以上與舊京睽違，但那情味是渝久彌親的，何况這學校與我到底有過四年的關係。久住北平的人，大約都知道師範大學之「火」，在我的記憶中，至少已有四次大火，每次都是損失不貲。最近一次是民國二十二年冬天，距今已有十五年了，在火災上看起來，未免過於頻數，在人生與世事則正亦一不　的階段，十五年來，正合杜甫所謂：「聞道長安似奕棋，百年世事不勝悲，王侯第宅皆新主，文武衣冠異昔時」幾句話，而且想到「同學少年多不賤」，就更會增一番惆悵。也有人說，師大是火神廟舊址，一且夷滅，當然神會赫然斯怒的，這當然不可稽考，可是在離這裏不遠就是另外一個火神廟，所謂文化商塲者是。因了這個，也就難免想到北平新年最熱鬧的廠甸。</p>
<p>廠甸即是文化街琉璃廠的中心，那裏恰好有一小小的空地，謂之海玉村公園，大約是清初在此發掘出來一塊遼代的石刻，知道那時名為海王村，殆是郊外。海王村的對面就是明代燒琉璃瓦的窰廠，亦即今之師範學校，戰前的師範大學也。嚴分宜所寫的琉璃窰廠榜書，已竟由一個僻暗的墻陬改懸到自來水塔的壁上，對着朝陽閃閃發光。若以買書諭，師範大學應該是最幸福的，出校門往南不到五百步便是琳琅滿目的「廠肆」，邃雅齋，來　閣，偷池　，隨你翻閱，可是你別嫌那老板架子大，見了你連一可寒暄都沒有，你須知道，他們往來的不是胡適之便是趙蜚雲，北平圖書館，松公府（北大圖書館）是他們常去的，扶着藍色袱就可以升堂入室，不比你，還得有善本閱覽證才能呌開那實藏的門。——實藏，來自何處？你得感激他們搜羅之功，雖然萬曆本的金瓶梅詞話是用二十幾塊錢從山西的「故家」買來而賣給北圖是一千幾，試想沒有這些傢伙你不還得把着崇禎本當祖宗？只要你的地位够得上，你說要什麽看——譬如說，中日問題吧，包你在一個星期內，連你所想不到的材料都會開往目錄上，擺在寫字台邊。你想，他們怎麼會禾一起個得看出茅廬的大學生？所以我勸你還是忍一忍，而且你也眞沒有那麼些富裕，因為師大一向是以「窮」著名的。</p>
<p>我很愛看李南　的琉璃廠書肆記，文章不過作於道咸間，到光緒中繆筱珊作　記時已是再三慨嘆滄桑變化了，如今五十年來，不知又有幾許流轉，我們當然有資格此繆氏更加欷歔，無奈不能寫出那樣好的文章來。這裏要說得廠甸還不是那些深　　出版本月錄爛熟於胸中的老　，而且一到大年初一，海王村公園附近就成為臨時市塲，古人所謂百戲　陳，大約也就差不多。從前是舊歷正月初一才有，自革命後，就移到陽歷新年，可是舊歷年到底是打不到的，仍然以春節的名義借尸還魂。當初改至陽歷年時，攤肆反對的，幾經强迫，才勉强應應市，舊年本不許再設，可是終於被人情衝破了法定的樊離，從此就好像我們過年一樣，新舊並行，廠甸遂由舊年前直延至舊年後的正月二十日了。</p>

<p>艾森豪威爾將軍雖然軍功赫赫，却是個愛好和平的人；他深信敎育是抵抗戰爭的最佳之武器。於某次畢業典禮演說中他曾說：「你們的職業應該以使我們失業為目的。」</p>
<p>於美國西點軍官學校的物理班里，一位物理敎員在講授原子學說，他在黑板上寫了一個方程式，說是這個方程式有關於若干電子變動的問題。接着他把整個的黑板寫滿了方程式，最後他說道：「你們看，電子比開始的時候少了五個了。這五個電子到那里去了呢？」</p>
<p>課堂里没有一人作聲。這位敎員又大聲問道：「諸位，這五個電子究竟到那里去了呢？」形勢顯得嚴重了，此時後排有一學生大聲命令道：「不許一人離開這敎室，我們得搜查一下！」</p>
<p>有一天一位名律師正坐在事務所里，一個女子闖了進來立即聲言要和丈夫離婚。</p>
<p>律師問道：「根據什麽理由呢？」</p>
<p>她答稱她認為她的丈夫對她有不忠實的行為。</p>
<p>「你根據什麽證據認為你的丈夫對你有不忠實的行為呢？」</p>
<p>那個女子答道：「因為我深信他不是我的孩子的父親。」</p>
<p>荷蘭女王韋爾赫密娜遊美國，曾訪問西點居官學校。事前學校當局把歡迎的節目佈置得很是週密，可是忘了一點；沒有預擬好軍樂隊該奏什麽曲子。所以女王光降時樂隊指揮者便命演奏他自己所最喜歡的一個曲子，曲子的名字呌敞：「這灰色的老雌馬，她已不復如前了。」</p>
<p>有一次舉行慈善舞會，蕭伯納出席參加，會次邀一老處女跳舞。</p>
<p>正在跳舞的時候，老處女向蕭翁道：「你為什揀中了我要和我跳舞呢？」</p>
<p>蕭翁答道：「這次不是慈善舞會嗎？」</p>
<p>一個乞丐拉住了一位面目慈善的路人的袖子哀求道：「請你給我五分鐘讓我喝一杯咖啡吧，先生！」</p>
<p>路人轉過身來向他打量了一下，問道：「我爲什麽應該給你錢呢？你何以會一寒至此的呢？」</p>
<p>乞丐答道；「為了一件很不幸的禍事，先生。兩年之前，我和你一樣，也是一個很體面的商人。在我的辦公桌上有一條座右銘：「思想必須精密，任事必須堅決！』營業很是鼎盛，後來……後來……」乞丐的身體顫動着，「……後來那個打掃房間的女人把我的那條座右銘燒掉了。」</p>
<p>有兩位作家向一個房東租了一宅房子，定期一年，房東允為他們把屋子重新油漆一下。</p>
<p>後來二位作家見房東無意實行他的諾言，乃央律師與房東另訂了一個契約，允許他們自己出錢把屋子油漆一下。房東自然欣然簽了字。</p>
<p>在遷出的兩天之前，他們把整個屋子漆成了黑色。</p>

<p>英國的現行捐稅，徵課甚重，因而難免發生逃稅的情形，下面這則小故事是載刊在倫敦的「晚報」上面的。</p>
<p>一個富有的商人進醫院動了一次手術。事後，外科醫生開來了一張合美金一千六百八十元（英金四百幾尼亞，每幾尼亞合二十一先令）的帳單。</p>
<p>「我並不是想抵賴」，病人告訴醫生說，「因為我能够付得出這筆帳。不過，你可知道，在現行的差級稅之下，我至少要　六萬四千元才能付你的一千六百八十元的帳？」</p>
<p>醫生承認這一點。病人網續說道：「你在醫生之中是第一流的人物。你一定也付着重稅。你預算在一千六百八十元之中你自己可以眞正到手多少？」</p>
<p>醫生潦草的計算了片刻，宣佈道：「大約一百零八塊錢。」</p>
<p>「如此，」病人說，「為了要付你一百零八元，我得去賺六萬四千元。這樣吧，我們用一箱威司忌酒把這筆帳解決了，如何？」</p>
<p>「算數，」醫生說。</p>
<h3 id="c116">錢與文化 <a href="#c116" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e116" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">116</a></h3>
<p>— 玄玄</p>
<p>筆者年來除了對於全副美式配備的同胞甚表敬意以外，頗留心於有資格者對於美國文化的批評。可是限於時間經濟，連涉獵都談不到，就記憶所及，值得注意的則有蘇聯報告文學者愛倫堡的看法，代表中國知識人的陳衡哲的看法，和美國新聞記者約翰根塞的看法。後者雖覺波瀾壯闊，尙不及前兩者之談言微中。但無雖怎樣，他們都有一得之見，並不是祗知道美國玻璃絲複那一種牌子最好便算是懂得美國也。</p>
<p>最近則又看到一個哥倫比亞人的看法，其人名洛塞諾，曾任哥倫比亞國外交部長，於倦遊美國歸來，在某報上發表他對於美國文化的觀感，頗足發人深思。</p>
<p>以下是洛塞諾的看法：</p>
<p>「美國人者，今日之羅馬人也。物質的偉大，技術的完美，跟百萬當翁和美婦合起來，足以使人漠視其年輕而單純的靈魂。</p>
<p>「美國的大學敎育是平庸的，因為第一，太注重體育，第二，學科的價值輕重不分。專講實際的美國法學院祗製造律師，不產生法學家。（按：胡適嘗批評日本文化，謂日本祗有敎授，沒有學者。）醫學院只注重實驗室和X光，而沒有歐洲那種臨床的研究方法。</p>
<p>「富蘭克林以後，當美國人向西開拓的時皎，除了惠特曼和愛倫普以外，美國文化在退步。（按：弗蘭克·哈里斯亦嘗慨嘆於朝氣勃勃的美國人太虐待了惠特曼和愛倫普的天才。（現在美國又在試圖創造文化。美國的晉榮，建築，和書籍都缺乏舊時文化那一份優美，但這只是美國人尙未成熟，我們尙不能要求其知識的滲透。我們要比北美人老，老得多……但文化是跟着財富而來的……今日的美國雖然沒有哥德，沒有莎士比亞，沒有康德，沒有雜萊斯扣斯，但正有千萬人在努力以求。」</p>
<p>以上的話，雖然祇有一　半爪，但筆者以為大可深思。美國人雖然平庸浅薄，但美國有地是活力，有活力便有創造。美國的花花綠綠的書報固然不能代表深度的文明，但有四千年歷史，而今日的書店祗印「四庫備要」以供裝飾，和祗印「寫信不求人」以資實用，也算不了保存國粹。而且這樣下去，不但國粹包不全，大槪只能省下一些國渣了。</p>
<p>洛塞諾說得不錯；文化是跟着財富而來的。國家窮，老百姓窮，便不會有文化。縱有歷史上的文化，也祗供有錢的外國考古家作發掘之用。自己也顧不到。在普遍的窮困的時候，聽到洛塞諾的話，分外驚心怵目。</p>

<p>第六章　如此良宵（三三）</p>
<p>渚齋正要稱謝，接着又聽綺紈說道：「你知道這是什麽？」渚齋道：「珍珠的。」綺紈道：「不，是變珠，『變珠』是我的乳名，你要記着。」說時把頭微微一側，秀髮向後一摔，微　秋波一笑，嫵媚極了。渚齋在這情景之下，情不自禁，緊緊握住牠的手說：「謝謝你，你把貼身寶貴的東西送給我，我拿什麽東西贈你？祗有把我這顆赤心貢獻給你。」綺紈把渚齋緊握的手，也緊一緊道：「那是我求之不得，我太感激你了！從今天起，敌心靈上，得了一種安慰。」因把　　向左略略一偏，一頭　在渚齋肩膀上，曼聲道：「渚，再過幾個鐘頭，我們便要離別了，你還有什麽話告訴我嗎？」渚齋道：「我祗望你早去早回，我們早日相見！」這幾句話，似乎不是綺紈心裏所期望的，把頭靠着渚齋肩上連搖幾搖道：「怕不能在短期間就回來，因為在濟南露演，青島光陸戲院，必定也要來邀請，旣來濟南，就不能不順路去青島。如此一來，在短時期我怎能回來？我希望你每隔兩三天，給我一對信，把這裏情形，詳詳細細告訴我。你能答應嗎？」渚齋道：「當然能辦到。此外還有一件要緊事，要求你答應。」綺紈立把頭一轉，向渚齋瞬了一眼，含笑很注意聽着，祗聽渚齋說道：「我要求你，你——你——不要再像今天這樣縱飲酒能傷人，你要注意嗓音！」綺紈肩頭蹙道：「我何嘗愛喝酒！有時我心裏難過，不得已才喝酒，要藉杯中物，麻醉我的腦筋，現在我心裏得了安慰，不再喝了！」說後，拉了渚齋起來，一同到她臥室，並肩在牀沿坐下，重復說道：」渚！再過幾個鐘頭我要走了，你還有什麼話告訴我？我心裏有許多話要告訴你，祇是不知從何說起！」渚齋道：「我何嘗不是如此！總之，我們相見很晚！」綺执道：「不！我認為還不晚。」渚齋覺得這一句話，綺紈命意，完全表露出來，是特地給他一個機會，但是自已沒有這勇氣，想着，漸漸低下頭去。綺紈見他不答，看了他一眼，也歛住笑容。正在此時，房門一動，小王媽手裏托着一雙洋漆茶盤，走了進來，盤上放了兩隻茶杯，和一碟削好的梨，一碟橄欖，把茶盤裏茶和水菓擺在茶几上，笑道：「今天老板的酒，喝了不少，我泡了兩杯普洱茶，雨碟水菓，預備解酒。」綺紈道：「我正想買些水菓，你却預備好了。」渚齋笑對小王媽菹：「有其主必有其僕。」小王媽道：「徐先生！你到開玩笑，什麽主呀！僕呀！我全不懂。「說着帶着笑聲出去。</p>

<p>[Reuters, Washington, 5th] President Truman will propose a $300 million aid to China plan in his message at the opening of this congressional session.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper] New York, 5th Broadcast: Washington News, the State Department is drafting a new aid to China plan and is expected to request Congress to aid China with at least several hundred million U.S. dollars.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 5th] The U.S. Congress will open on the 6th. The specific aid to China plan to be proposed by the State Department will be one of the main topics of the meeting. Our technical advisory group invited to go to the United States has decided to consist of Yu Dawei, Bei Zuyi, and their entourage, including Deng Zhenxu, Secretary of the Ministry of Communications, and Chen Renlun, Secretary of the Ministry of Finance, totaling five people. In recent days, relevant government agencies such as the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Communications, and the Central Bank have been exceptionally busy. Responsible personnel have even worked overtime to prepare necessary information for Yu and his party. The main information includes the general current situation of China's finance, economy, transportation, and military, with particular emphasis on the financial revenue and expenditure deficit and the difficulties in coping with it. It is possible that Mr. Yu and others will attend the U.S. Congress to provide detailed reports and answer questions when the aid to China plan is being studied, so that Congress, which manages the financial power of the United States, can obtain a more detailed understanding of China's situation from directly provided materials. Mr. Yu and Mr. Bei's departure date is approaching, and they have been particularly busy in recent days. Foreign Minister Wang hosted a private banquet for Yu, Bei, Yu Hongjun, Zhang Jia'ao, Gan Naiguang, and others at his residence on the 5th at noon. During the banquet, they extensively exchanged views on matters related to U.S. aid. At 4:30 p.m., Mr. Yu was summoned to meet with Chairman Chiang for instructions. According to reliable sources, Mr. Bei is scheduled to leave Nanjing on the 6th to return to Shanghai to check the information prepared by the Central Bank and pack his luggage. Mr. Yu is also scheduled to go to Shanghai on the 8th to meet with his companions before flying to the United States. Mr. Yu's stay in the United States is expected to be four weeks. It has not yet been decided whether Mr. Bei will return home at the same time.</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 5th] The Ministry of Foreign Affairs confirmed that Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov's reply to our note of the 5th of last month regarding the proposal for a preparatory meeting for the peace treaty with Japan was delivered to our Ministry of Foreign Affairs by the Soviet Embassy in China on the evening of the 2nd of this month. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs declined to announce the official attitude it might take to deal with the stalemate in the future. According to analysis by related parties, there is no need to be overly pessimistic about the preparation work for the peace treaty. In this reply, the Soviet Union did not mention the retention of veto power during the voting at the conference, which clearly still maintains a consistent attitude with our country. It also considered the other countries outside the four major powers, and adopted the method of establishing a small committee to recruit countries to participate, as agreed upon by the London Foreign Ministers' Conference. This proposal shows that the Soviet Union is not completely indifferent to the convening of the peace conference. The future development will still depend on our country's efforts and the United States' patience.</p>

<p>[United Press, Nanjing, 5th] General Feng Yuxiang went to the United States in the capacity of an official inspection group and publicly attacked the Chinese government. Five Chinese people here, who are by no means "sympathetic to the Kuomintang," have strongly criticized this.</p>
<p>A United Press reporter raised this question to seven Chinese people with prominent anti-Kuomintang views. Among them, everyone condemned Feng, one person refused to comment, and the remaining one defended the "Christian General."</p>
<p>Among the seven people, two were university professors, two were university students, two were professional people, and one was a businessman. One university student, claiming to be by no means pro-communist, believed that in a democratic government, government officials, whether at home or abroad, have the right to speak freely, so he believed that Feng's actions were not inappropriate. One of the professors said that he "neither condemned nor approved" of Feng's anti-Kuomintang speeches and articles.</p>
<p>The other five people, including two former members of the Democratic League and three others who strongly criticized the Kuomintang, unanimously condemned Feng for "lacking patriotism." Everyone believed that Feng lacked personal ethics because he used his inspection group status to attack the government in a foreign country.</p>
<p>[United Press, Hong Kong, 5th] The Chinese Democratic League held its third plenary session here today and issued a statement denying that the Chinese government's declaration of the Democratic League as illegal was legitimate. It stated: "The order has not been approved by the State Council, nor has it been announced by the Executive Yuan. We will still strive for China's democracy, peace, and unity." The meeting is chaired by Shen Junru and is scheduled to close on the 9th.</p>

Workers from the Public Works Bureau demolished the first thatched hut at 7:55 this morning. The Hong Kong government mobilized as many as 250 policemen for this work, each carrying tear gas and other equipment.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 5th] Regarding the United Press Hong Kong telegram of January 4, which stated that our Foreign Minister Wang Shijie said, "The eviction of two thousand Kowloon residents is an internal matter for the Hong Kong government," the reporter recently inquired with Shi Zhaoying, acting director of the Intelligence Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, who said, "Minister Wang has never made such remarks."

<h3 id="e9">After Implementation of the Crackdown on Illegal Private Banks, All Private Banks in Hankou Suspend Operations; Financial Management Bureau Decides to Implement Established Policy <a href="#e9" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c9" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">9</a></h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Hankou, 5th] After the Hankou Financial Management Bureau ordered a crackdown on illegal private banks, today is the day to start implementing the suspension of operations and liquidation. In addition to the 44 illegal private banks that have closed their doors, the remaining 59 legal private banks have also unanimously suspended operations to avoid bank runs, causing considerable anxiety in the local financial community. After various local private banks ran around appealing, the local authorities suggested slowing down the crackdown, but all were rejected by the bureau. The director of the bureau, Lin Chongyong, said today that this matter has been reported to the central authorities and must be thoroughly implemented. It concerns the implementation of national policy, and he would rather resign than compromise the law. Furthermore, various illegal private banks also entertained reporters today and published announcements, making demands on the bureau's measures. Note: The background of the private banking industry in Hankou is complex and has not been thoroughly clarified for a long time, so the public generally attaches great importance to this strict crackdown by the government.</p>
<h3 id="e10">Food Department Drafts Plans for the Five Cities of Nanjing, Shanghai, Beiping, Tianjin, and Guangzhou, Which Can Be Completed Within This Week <a href="#e10" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c10" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">10</a></h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 5th] The Ministry of Food is currently drafting a plan for the food supply and demand for the expanded rationing in the five cities of Shanghai, Beiping, Tianjin, Guangzhou, which may be completed within this week and sent to the Executive Yuan for approval before it can be announced and implemented. According to sources from the Ministry of Food, the implementation of this rationing method may be delayed until February. According to the investigation and statistics of the Ministry of Food, the total amount of food required by all civil servants, students, professional, industrial, and transport workers, charitable organizations, and newspaper employees in the five cities is 460,000 shi of rice and 500,000 bags of flour per month. Calculated on an annual basis, the total amount of food required will reach more than 550,000 tons, which is beyond the reach of the food currently controlled by the government. In the plan, relief supplies from the United States will account for 50%, and the original public education rations will also be used to supplement it, but it is still insufficient, amounting to about 250,000 shi. The Ministry of Food plans to ask the Executive Yuan to approve the allocation of funds by the Ministry of Finance to purchase the shortfall of food, either domestically or abroad. The Ministry of Food is very cautious about this and decided to start processing only after the source of food for the whole year is secured, so as not to be interrupted midway due to various reasons.</p>
<h3 id="e11">Kuomintang's Weekly Memorial Service for Sun Yat-sen; President Chiang Instructs Party Affairs; The Most Urgent Task This Year is the General Registration of Party Members <a href="#e11" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c11" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">11</a></h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 5th] The Kuomintang Central Headquarters held the first weekly memorial service for Sun Yat-sen of the 37th year of the Republic of China on the morning of the 5th. President Chiang led the ceremony, and after performing the ceremony as usual, he delivered a speech on the spot, making a general review of the party affairs work in the past year and giving a brief instruction on the central work of the party affairs this year. The gist of the original words is as follows: "The greatest achievement of the party affairs work in the past year is the completion of the election of representatives to the National Assembly, because convening the National Assembly to implement constitutional government and return power to the people is the consistent goal of our party's revolution. Comrades in party affairs work in various places have worked hard and diligently, making concerted efforts to complete the election work as scheduled. It is a major event in the process of our party's revolution and the most glorious contribution of our party affairs work comrades to the country. The second is the completion of the unified organization of the party and the group. In January last year, the Fourth Plenary Session of the Central Committee of our party decided to unify the party and group organizations in order to concentrate the strength of the party. All comrades of our party can understand the overall situation and the overall situation. In order to implement the party's decision, they do not hesitate to sacrifice their personal rights and status. This is a concrete manifestation of the revolutionary spirit and is very gratifying. In terms of party affairs this year, the most urgent work is to complete the general registration of party members. Party affairs workers in various places must strictly implement the decisions of the central government, work hard and diligently, break through favoritism, eliminate wavering elements, and absorb excellent party members to rectify the revolutionary ranks and enrich the revolutionary forces. As for the party headquarters itself, it is especially necessary to strive to improve the spirit of work and to strengthen it, and to establish the spirit of "new," "fast," and "real" work, strive for excellence, and seek truth from facts, so as to cooperate with politics and military affairs to thoroughly complete our mission of suppressing the rebellion and building the country.</p>
<p>Elected National Representatives Petition the Central Standing Committee, Requesting Various Points Without Approval</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 5th] The National Representative Signed Nomination Candidates Association again sent representatives such as Ma Wenche to petition the Kuomintang Central Standing Committee regular meeting on the morning of the 5th, requesting the revocation of the implementation measures for the supplementary regulations for party nominations passed by the State Council, the party member concession measures, and the election headquarters to promptly announce the list of elected candidates and issue election certificates. They submitted a memorandum and a second declaration to the Central Standing Committee, which was read at the meeting. The Standing Committee sent Wang Qijiang and Li Wenfan to receive them. After talking for more than two hours, Wang and Li still persuaded the representatives to abide by President Chiang's instructions, obey the party's decisions, and complete the general election.</p>
<p>Number of Members of Anhui Reporters Association; The Newspaper Association Department Often Adds a Zero When Writing; Rumors of Blank Ballots are Not True</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 5th] The number of members of the Anhui Reporters Association reached more than 6,000 in the newspaper association department. Therefore, during the previous National Congress election, some candidates who participated in the election rushed to Anhui to campaign. When they arrived in Anhui, they learned that the actual number was only over 1,000. As for the widespread rumors of 5,000 blank votes, the reporter recently visited the Workers and Women Election Headquarters to inquire about the handling of these 5,000 blank votes. Chief Secretary Zhai said that he had also heard of 6,000 members before, but because it seemed doubtful compared to the number of members in other places, he immediately telegraphed the Anhui election office to inquire. He has now received a reply from Anhui, informing him that the actual number is 1,059, and the total number of votes cast during the National Congress election is also less than 1,000, so there are no blank votes. The rumors are actually a mistake in previous rumors. According to another reporter's investigation, the mistake of 6,000 lies in the fact that there are more than 500 members of the Revolutionary County Reporters Association in Anhui Province. Due to carelessness when reporting, a zero was added after the number, resulting in more than 5,000, so this error was caused. In fact, there are no 5,000 blank votes.</p>
<p>Military Agencies in Nanjing Conserve Vehicle Fuel; Implementation Measures to be Formulated Starting This Month</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 5th] The Ministry of National Defense, in accordance with Chairman Chiang's handwritten instructions, conserves the consumption of vehicle fuel by military agencies in the capital.

It is estimated that a total of 573 vehicles of various types, large, medium, and small, will be recovered, saving approximately 659,000 gallons of gasoline per month.</p>
<p>Food Supply in Nanjing and Shanghai is Abundant; Price Hikes Will Soon Fall Back; Remarks by Senior Officials of the Ministry of Food</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 5th] The New Year has just passed, and prices in the Nanjing and Shanghai areas have risen sharply. The reporter specifically visited senior officials of the Ministry of Food to inquire whether effective measures will be taken. They said: "The food supply in Nanjing and Shanghai is not lacking, and the government can control a lot of food. This price hike may be related to the issuance of large bills, and it will definitely fall back in the short term." The reporter also asked about the supply of military food and the composition of requisitioned grain. They replied: "The military food is adequately planned and there is no shortage. The requisitioning is expected to reach 70% by the end of the 36th year of the Republic of China, which is quite optimistic. The issues that the Ministry of Food is considering and researching are still the circulation of food. The Ministry of Food previously sent Deputy Minister Chen Liang and Tian Fu Department Director Zhang Daoming to Wuhan to supervise the requisitioning. They are now studying on-site the method of transporting grain from Central China to North China. In this way, there will be no uneven phenomenon of food greed. At the same time, after overall planning, the Ministry of Food can decide to purchase foreign rice from abroad, and it is reported that some people have suggested that the government ask the American Aid to China Association to allocate funds from its unused Aid to China Relief Fund to purchase grain, but this has not yet been decided by the government.

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3 id="e20">After the Partial Implementation of the Sino-Hong Kong Agreement <a href="#e20" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c20" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">20</a></h3>
<p>The Sino-Hong Kong Financial Agreement has been officially announced and implemented as of yesterday. Consultations on this agreement began in July of last year, and it was signed on the 15th of the following month. It was originally scheduled to be announced simultaneously by both parties on August 18th. However, on the 17th, our country promulgated new foreign exchange control measures, using the devaluation of the legal tender to compete for foreign exchange. Hong Kong, therefore, hesitated and repeatedly delayed the implementation. Towards the end of September, the Governor of Hong Kong, Sir Alexander Grantham, visited the capital for discussions, and negotiations were revived. Concrete results were repeatedly reported, and the date of implementation was repeatedly announced. However, apart from Hong Kong's promulgation of new regulations on Hong Kong goods sailing to Chinese ports in early November, stipulating that they would take effect from the 5th of that month, there was no other progress. Therefore, there was much speculation outside, and it was almost assumed that the agreement had been declared stillborn.</p>
<p>The Sino-Hong Kong Financial Agreement implemented yesterday is only a portion of the original agreement, which was approved by the Governor of Hong Kong in Beijing and implemented first. There are two main points: first, major export goods from our country, such as tungsten, tung oil, rapeseed oil, pig bristles, and cotton yarn, when transported to Hong Kong for transshipment, must prove that the foreign exchange earned has been sold to or is contracted to be sold to designated Chinese banks; second, Hong Kong prohibits the import and export of more than five million legal tender in cash. Although the agreement also stipulates that the bills of lading of all vessels sailing from Hong Kong to China must be stamped by the Hong Kong government, this measure has already been implemented since November 5th of last year, and this is simply a restatement, so in effect only the above two items are new.</p>
<p>However, we cannot underestimate the value of the partial implementation of this agreement. Because for local goods transported to Hong Kong, the foreign exchange earned must be proven to have been sold to or will be sold to designated Chinese banks; this measure will undoubtedly increase our country's foreign exchange income and reduce the amount of smuggling of local goods. The restriction on the import and export of cash, and the strengthening of the management of the banking industry, will certainly be of some help to our country's measures to control finance.</p>
<p>However, partial implementation means that its effectiveness is also only partial. In terms of finance, there are no explicit provisions in this agreement on how to crack down on capital flight or overseas purchases. Moreover, it is estimated that the overseas remittances remaining in Hong Kong in the year before last were worth approximately 400 million Hong Kong dollars. What the figure was last year, however, is unknown. Although this amount of foreign exchange has been discussed many times, the agreement does not mention it. This is clearly far from our country's policy of absorbing overseas remittances and replenishing foreign exchange reserves. Fortunately, the agreement now being implemented is only a part, and it is hoped that in the parts to be implemented subsequently, attention will be paid to this.</p>
<p>In terms of goods, although the so-called "New Regulations on Hong Kong Goods Sailing to Chinese Ports" have long been implemented, Hong Kong is separated from the mainland by only a strip of water, and the coastline is intricate. There are numerous routes for smuggling, whether by land or sea. The method of simply stamping Hong Kong goods seems insufficiently thorough for combating smuggling. Moreover, according to Hong Kong's enforcement methods, the smuggled goods seized and the penalties imposed are all within Hong Kong and not within our territory. There is no clause requiring them to notify our country after discovering a ship carrying smuggled goods. Therefore, our country does not benefit much from this. The smuggled goods confiscated after punishment can still be smuggled in a second or third time. Such anti-smuggling efforts are not thorough enough.</p>
<p>According to initial reports, the so-called Sino-Hong Kong Agreement originally had two parts: an economic agreement and a tariff agreement. What has been announced and implemented this time is only a part of the economic agreement. As for the parts that have not been announced and implemented, because they have not been announced, it is impossible to speculate on their content. If Hong Kong can take a broad view and implement these reserved parts together in advance, it is believed that it will be of greater help in promoting Sino-Hong Kong trade and stabilizing each other's economic foundations.</p>
<p>As for our country, although the partial implementation this time may achieve considerable results in the competition for foreign exchange and the prevention of smuggling, it is doubtful whether the loopholes in smuggling import and export goods can be completely blocked, given the large difference between the official foreign exchange rate and the black market rate. We believe that the two important tasks of absorbing overseas remittances and strengthening anti-smuggling efforts still need to be emphasized and effectively improved.</p>
<p>The fundamental method, in addition to passive prevention and control, is to actively guide. The import-export linkage method advocated by people is still worth considering. As long as the current import controls continue to be implemented, there is no need to worry about the quantity or type of import goods after the above method is implemented; however, export trade can be promoted from then on, and export foreign exchange can be expected to have a legitimate destination. Overseas remittances and overseas gold can be expected to flow back into the country under the guise of imported foreign goods. If materials are more abundant and raw materials and machinery are supplied, then production enterprises will not gradually shrink, and the general price inflation may be slightly eased. As a result, the burden of the foreign exchange reserves required by the state will be lighter, especially for other matters. Although this has no direct relationship with the Sino-Hong Kong Agreement, it has the same effect as competing for foreign exchange and preventing smuggling, so it is mentioned together.</p>

<h3 id="e24">Zhejiang University Incident Over Public Burial of Yu Zisan <a href="#e24" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c24" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">24</a></h3>
<p>Students Clash with Rickshaw Pullers and Others</p>
<p>[Our Hangzhou Office, 5th Dispatch] Yesterday, Zhejiang University students clashed with night shift rickshaw pullers, trishaw drivers, wonton vendors, porters, and workers from the snack shop workers' mutual aid society inside the school over the public burial of Yu Zisan. There were injuries on both sides. Today, representatives of the workers went to the provincial and municipal authorities to petition and distributed a letter to the fathers, elders, brothers, sisters throughout the country, stating that: During the last Zhejiang University turmoil, Hangzhou was under martial law for a long time, causing their business to be sluggish. They are afraid that another incident will lead to martial law and affect their livelihoods. They sent manual laborers to the school to petition, but they were insulted and beaten, shot with guns and bullets, resulting in more than twenty injuries, some serious. More than ten people were detained and were only released at 7:00 PM. Therefore, they are requesting sympathy from all sectors of society and are lodging four protests with the Zhejiang University Student Union: 1. Hand over the murderers and severely punish them according to the law. 2. Compensate for the damage and issue a public apology in the newspapers. 3. Eliminate their barbarity. 4. Request the government to no longer condone evil. According to Zhejiang University officials: The Zhejiang University Student Union decided to bury Yu Zisan on the 4th. The school authorities had consulted with the provincial government about the funeral route, but no agreement was reached. The school union announced on the 3rd that the event would be postponed. At 9:00 AM yesterday, students gathered on campus to discuss the matter. The president and dean of students were both present to dissuade them. At this time, military police were heavily deployed at the school gates and surrounding routes, prohibiting passage. Suddenly, forty or fifty vagrants, carrying paper flags and wooden sticks, shouting slogans, broke into the school and beat students, resulting in a conflict between the two sides. More than ten students were injured, four seriously injured and have been sent to the local court for examination. The school is questioning the security authorities about the cause of the incident. Also, the Hangzhou General Labor Union convened a meeting to support the killed workers. The Hangzhou Department Store Workers' Union also sympathized and will send people to comfort the workers.</p>
<p>[Another Telegram] According to the Zhejiang News Office: It has recently been learned that there are Communist Party members lurking in a certain university in the capital who have come here to bewitch the Zhejiang University Student Union and have made a decision to publicly bury Yu Zisan and expand the parade and propaganda. The security authorities of the provincial capital and Zhejiang University believe that the public burial of a Communist Party member by students of a national school and the parade and propaganda during this time of turmoil cannot be tolerated. The school was instructed to earnestly dissuade and announce the suspension of the burial. However, the Student Union insisted on not complying, leading to the unfortunate incident.</p>

<p>Extortion and Kidnapping Case Overturned; District Procuratorate Files Appeal</p>
<p>Local Court Dismisses Judge Lin Gan</p>
<p>[Our Correspondent, Beiping, 5th] A case is currently attracting attention from local social figures: Ning Wenxuan, manager of Tongfa Chang Bank, filed a lawsuit against Ren Guorui and Wang Yunhua, managers of Lihua Bank, accusing them of colluding with Song Renhao and two demobilized military police officers to extort and kidnap him due to business disputes. The Beiping Local Court concluded the first trial, sentencing Song to death and the other four to life imprisonment. In the past three days, there has been much criticism from the public, pointing out that the plaintiff's aunt is currently a clerk for Lin Gan, the judge in this case, and the plaintiff's younger brother also has a son working as a probationary judge in the court.

The local court's inspection office deemed the sentence too heavy and filed an appeal, hoping that the High Court and the Inspectorate would thoroughly investigate. Recently, there have been satirical remarks in Beiping, saying there is "reason" with "bars," but no "law" and no "heaven," referring to gold bars and legal tender.

<p>All Under the Command of the Lhasa Government</p>
<p>[Our Correspondent, Nanjing, 5th] Regarding the political organization of Tibet, it has recently been learned from the Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission that the local political organization of Tibet is the "Dzong" (the original Tibetan meaning of "Dzong" is a fortress, because the location of the Tibetan "Dzong" is always on high ground with built fortresses for defense), similar to a county in the interior.

<h3 id="e30">US Congress Reopens Tomorrow: Truman Prepared to Submit Message Urging Curbing Domestic Inflation and Rapidly Aiding Europe <a href="#e30" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c30" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">30</a></h3>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 5th] President Truman's message to be submitted on Wednesday at the opening of the current Congress is now ready. He will warn Congress that unless it takes the most urgent action to curb domestic inflation and assist in European recovery, the United States will lose its leadership position in the world. According to White House sources, Truman will reiterate the following points: The restoration of wage and price controls and the rationing system is the only way to stop inflation. Failure to curb this trend will inevitably lead to an economic panic within a year; Any attempts to delay the passage of the Marshall Plan until after March 31, drastically reduce the total amount of aid, weaken its management system, or avoid binding the United States for four years, will have the most serious impact on the European aid plan itself and on the US foreign policy that relies on that plan as its main instrument. Since 1948 is a presidential election year, and domestic inflation and European recovery are major issues in the campaign, the President's message to the current Congress will focus on these two issues. Other minor issues to be addressed include requests for legislation to eliminate racial discrimination and to increase the quota of European exiles allowed to enter the United States to 100,000 per year.</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 4th] President Truman and the Republican-controlled Congress are bracing for a showdown on the three major issues of the day. The rise and fall of the Democratic and Republican parties in this year's presidential election will depend on these. The three major issues are tax cuts, the high cost of living, and the Marshall Plan. Members of both parties have now returned to Washington, preparing to attend the opening of the 80th Congress on the 7th of this month. Each party will blame the other for the high cost of living. The President plans to submit three messages to Congress, starting with the State of the Union address on the 7th, followed by the economic message on the 9th, and then the budget on the 12th. The total may reach as high as 40 billion yuan, breaking the record for peacetime.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 4th] When Congress begins debating the Marshall Plan, the first issue will focus on whether Marshall himself or an independent businessman should control the purse strings. President Truman has asked Congress to place the responsibility for the proposed $17 billion European Recovery Plan on the shoulders of managers directed and controlled by Marshall, but Republican leaders such as House Speaker Martin and Senator Taft have expressed opposition, arguing that all foreign loans should be placed in the hands of a bipartisan government agency. Taft said: President Truman's plan would make the fee agency, in effect, a bureau under the jurisdiction of the State Department. Senator Connally, a Democratic Senator on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, believes that responsibility should rest entirely with the State Department and that any action to limit the State Department's authority would be unfortunate.</p>

<p>[United Press, Washington, 4th] US Secretary of State Marshall resumed his duties on the 5th after a sixteen-day leave of absence during the most critical period in US foreign policy history. Marshall's strategy is to take action to prevent the diplomatic and economic conflict between and the United States, which the people hope will not develop into a world war. His main weapon will be the European Recovery Program, also known as the Marshall Plan.</p>
<p>His first battlefield will be the halls of Congress, to decide whether this plan is needed; second, to decide how many billions should be allocated and in what form the United States should provide this aid. Next Wednesday will be the first anniversary of Marshall's departure from China, where he strongly criticized both the Communists and Nationalists. Before he declared his failure to resolve the Chinese Civil War, President Truman appointed him as Secretary of State, replacing Byrnes. This Wednesday, after another failure, Marshall will begin his historically important Marshall Plan in Congress. This time, it is a continuation of the failure to reach a common position with the Soviet Union on the German and Austrian peace treaties. Marshall was forced to decide that the economic reconstruction of the world, especially Western Europe, should precede a peaceful resolution. The US Senate Foreign Relations Committee will begin reviewing Marshall's plan to provide $17 billion to Western Europe over four years, starting on April 1st. Marshall will be the first witness to testify before Congress on Wednesday.</p>

However, Hungary is not currently as completely controlled by the Communist Party as other Balkan countries, so actions to prepare for Hungary's participation in this federation are underway. It is expected that major events will occur in Hungary soon. According to a statement released by TASS after Hungarian Deputy Prime Minister and Communist leader Rakosi met with reporters from the Hungarian Communist Party newspaper, the policies of the free and democratic countries in the Danube region are gradually converging, and Hungary's foreign policy will undoubtedly develop in accordance with the principle of improving relations with neighboring countries.</p>
<h3 id="e35">Small General Assembly Opens Yesterday: Six Soviet Bloc Countries Refuse to Attend <a href="#e35" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c35" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">35</a></h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] New York, 5th (Radio): The United Nations "Small General Assembly" opened today, boycotted by the Soviet Union and the other five countries in the Soviet bloc, who refused to attend. US Representative Austin delivered a speech, urging the Soviet Union to abandon its prejudices, and said that the United States would not use the "Small General Assembly" to weaken the power of the Security Council. Those who believe in the spirit of the United Nations Charter need not fear the "Small General Assembly." We deeply hope that the countries of the Soviet bloc will soon be able to participate.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Manchester, 5th] The Manchester Guardian reported that the United Nations Small General Assembly is scheduled to be established on the 5th in Lake Success. President Truman has appointed Austin as the chief representative, and Jessup, a professor of international law and diplomacy at Columbia University, as Austin's deputy. It is expected that the main part of the daily work will be handled by Jessup. The Small General Assembly has two tasks: one is to consider issues referred by the General Assembly, and the other is to prepare for the study of issues to be submitted to the plenary session of the General Assembly. The first item on the agenda is to study the use of the veto power in the Security Council, and the second is to review how the General Assembly can complete international political cooperation. The State Department apparently wants to use the Small General Assembly as a hot water bottle to melt the international parliament and the cold war into mutual trust. Therefore, the US delegation will avoid any issues that could increase Soviet suspicion at the beginning of the Small General Assembly's work. The Soviet Union is still wary of these US strategies, so its delegation to the United Nations declared yesterday that the Soviet delegation does not intend to attend the Small General Assembly.</p>

<p>[Reuters, Stockholm, 5th] Professor Belven, a Swedish cancer expert who went to the Soviet Union for consultation, said in Finland yesterday: "My trip to the Soviet Union is not to treat cancer for Soviet dignitaries, but only to return the visit of several Soviet experts who visited me in Sweden a year ago."

Belven's actions remain strictly confidential, and even the Swedish embassy does not know the purpose of his trip.</p>
<h3 id="e37">Legal Council After Intense Debate: Hsu Mo Wins Preliminary Confidence, Widely Believed to Gain Support of the Council <a href="#e37" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c37" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">37</a></h3>
<p>[United Press International, Paris, 5th] On the 5th, after two hours of deliberation, Hsu Mo won his first vote of confidence in the council with 308 votes against 272. He requested five votes of confidence regarding the 105 billion franc emergency anti-inflation plan, and it seems likely that the last four will also win confidence. Hsu Mo's victory came after De Gaulle announced his six-point plan, including the abolition of the traditional trade union system.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Paris, 5th] The fate of the Hsu Mo cabinet will be decided in the National Assembly on the 5th. Hsu Mo requested five votes of confidence from the parliament regarding the new "Save the Franc" bill proposed by the cabinet, which stipulates the imposition of special taxes or mandatory subscription to public credit. However, parliamentarians expect that Premier Hsu is likely to gain majority support, as the Communist Party and the far-right Republican Liberty Party, which proposed amendments, will find it difficult to take closely coordinated action in this extremely important vote. If this new "Save the Franc" bill is passed by the parliament, the parliament will then consider the suggestion that taxpayers can subscribe to public bonds in lieu of paying taxes.</p>

This final five-year plan is expected to be announced on the 15th.

<p>[Report from this newspaper] The automatic adjustment formula for the prices of public utilities in this city has been decided to be implemented starting today. Electricity, telephone, gas, and tap water are the first four items to be applied, with adjustments ranging from 27% to 71%. Transportation services such as streetcars, buses, ferries, and small trains will increase in price starting on the 11th of this month, with the percentage of the increase being approved by the competent authority. According to Zhao Huiyu, director of the Public Utilities Bureau, to reporters yesterday, the characteristic of this adjustment is that the price of industrial electricity is 10% lower than ordinary electricity. The previous additional fee for exceeding 50,000 kilowatt-hours will be cancelled. The three-fold penalty for exceeding the limit for industrial gas has now been reduced to two-fold. Also, the average of the numbers for this adjustment is about 40%, which is slightly lower than the last time. The Public Utilities Bureau is applying the automatic adjustment formula for public utilities for the first time this time. In order to fully inform the citizens, it has decided to invite the conveners of the various groups of the Municipal Council for explanation within days. The adjusted new prices for electricity, telephone, gas, and tap water for this month are recorded below:</p>

Furthermore, the association believes that the emergence of these representatives is not in accordance with the provisions of the original organizational implementation outline, and has specifically telegraphed the Ministry of Economic Affairs requesting modification to conform to reality.</p>

Mayor Wu and Du Yuesheng, chairman of the Fundraising Committee of the committee, will attend and preside over the ceremony, inviting people from all walks of life to visit. Construction will begin on the same day after the groundbreaking ceremony. All houses are scheduled to be completed within eighty days. The winners will be able to receive the houses by the end of April after the lottery. The sale of charity tickets has been very popular in recent days. In order to regulate congestion and adapt to the needs of the general public to meet the citizens' desires, the committee has entrusted more than thirty commercial banks, including the National Bank, the Bank of Communications, and the Agricultural Bank, the four major newspaper offices, and the six major companies in the city to jointly sell reservation tickets starting today.

However, the ticket revenue of 12,000 tickets per group is only 1.2 billion, so the winners will actually have higher revenue than the previous aviation lottery. Afterwards, the sales method was discussed, and it was decided that each sales point would be temporarily responsible for 900 million gold and would settle accounts once a week to quickly gather the funds. Furthermore, National Government Vice President Sun previously ordered five charity tickets from the department and specified the number "101456" to show his advocacy.</p>

<p>[Report from this newspaper] A spokesman for China Aviation Corporation told reporters yesterday in reviewing the company's business situation over the past year that both cargo and passenger traffic have made considerable progress. In terms of passenger traffic, based on monthly statistics, the year-end is about four times that of the beginning of the year. On the one hand, this can reflect the difficulties of other domestic transportation, and on the other hand, it is enough to show the increased confidence of passengers in aviation safety. Speaking of this year's plan, the spokesman said: 1. The Sino-US air money schedule was originally once every two weeks, and it is planned to shorten it to "every week" in the short term. Comfortable sleeping chairs will also be installed on the plane. 2. Existing domestic routes will be maintained as much as possible and will not be reduced. 3. The Nanyang route can be opened soon once foreign exchange is approved. 4. If the situation permits, preparations will be made to open European routes in the second half of this year. 5. The Sino-Japanese route is currently being negotiated by the delegation to Japan, and the results have not yet been reported. [Another report] The business of Central Aviation Corporation focuses more on freight transport. The company's review report for last year has not yet been completed. The person in charge is also more conservative about the company's development plans for this year. It is said that various plans cannot be realized due to difficulties in the source of foreign exchange.</p>

<h3 id="e72">Building a Home from Scratch (Part 2): Some Stories of the Xiang-Gui Railway <a href="#e72" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c72" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">72</a></h3>
<p>[Aeronautical dispatch from Hengyang, 3rd] Starting from Guilin, the railway reached Quanzhou in April. After calculating all the mismatched and pieced-together rails and the steel rails dismantled from the Jintan section, it was still 60 kilometers short of reaching Hengyang. The Yuehan Railway was like Liu Bei borrowing Jingzhou, borrowing it and not returning it. After negotiations, it barely managed to scrape together 60 kilometers of old, abandoned rails. So, construction started from both ends. During these months, the construction workers sometimes used electric lights to work day and night. Southern Hunan and northern Guangxi are mountainous regions with much miasma. Furthermore, they suffered from war, and corpses littered the fields, which further aided the spread of epidemics. Also, due to rising prices and difficult living conditions, public order became a problem. Therefore, during the construction period of this line, four staff members and thirteen workers died on duty due to epidemics and banditry. During the opening ceremony, Director Yuan Menghong reported the hardships they encountered during the construction, and at one point, overcome with emotion, he burst into tears and could not speak.</p>
<h3 id="e73">Early Completion: Apart from Hard Work, Nothing Else is Essential <a href="#e73" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c73" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">73</a></h3>
<p>Due to the efforts of the construction workers, the work was completed a month ahead of schedule. The 230 kilometers from Quanzhou to Hengyang were completed in seven months, with an average of more than ten kilometers of track laid per day, which is a miracle in the eyes of the UNRRA personnel. Because this kind of record does not seem possible by human effort. In fact, the reason why the Xiang-Gui Railway was able to lay more than ten kilometers of track per day this time is not because the employees had any special abilities; they were still the same as ordinary people. The reason for this new record is simply that they were willing to endure hardship. They worked day and night, doing four hundred days of work in seven months, which is equivalent to one person doing the work of two people at the same time. There is nothing else that is essential, just being able to endure hardship.</p>
<h3 id="e74">Self-Reliance: The Most Powerful Expression of Facts <a href="#e74" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c74" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">74</a></h3>
<p>The difficulty of the Xiang-Gui Railway was not just the restoration of the tracks, but also the lack of locomotives and carriages. All the equipment needed did not receive any assistance from foreign transport; they all relied on their own ingenuity and self-reliance. They repaired abandoned locomotives found by the side of the road; they refurbished vehicles that were just empty shells and no longer valued. The special train for the opening ceremony had ten first-class sleeping cars, all new carriages manufactured in November by the Suqiao Machinery Factory of the Xiang-Gui-Qian Railway. According to the factory director Gu Ji, except for the glass, which was purchased from Hong Kong, everything else was made locally. Although the carriage the reporter rode was a low-hook, lacking steel plates, and inevitably a bit bumpy, all other equipment was no less than that of imported carriages. One has to compare goods to know their value. The equipment of the first-class sleeping cars of the Yuehan Railway is inferior. This kind of work performance shows that the Chinese people have the ability to "rely on their own efforts." People from friendly countries criticize us for relying on foreigners for everything. The restoration and opening of the Xiang-Gui Railway is a powerful factual rebuttal to this criticism. In the past, this major artery shouldered the important task of connecting the economy and culture of the southwest, and it made a great contribution to military and economic affairs. In the future, it will continue to undertake this important mission. We wish that in the near future, its right arm will be as active as its left arm, and that it will be able to reach Guiyang by next year. And that one day, its two legs, which are stepping on Zhennanguan and extending into Guangzhou Bay, can also stand up. (Special Correspondent Huang Chao Ru)</p>
<p>Fujian Industrial Research Institute Improves Lacquerware Technology</p>
<p>[Aeronautical dispatch from Fuzhou, 1st] Fujian lacquerware, which is famous far and wide, has an exquisite and elegant appearance, but the manufacturing process is quite complex. Even the weather and geographical conditions can affect its production. After further research, the Fujian Provincial Research Institute of Industrial Technology believes that the following are ways to improve: If the weather is not suitable and the lacquerware cannot dry, humidity regulation can be used to promote drying. Manual polishing takes too long. In the future, mechanical polishing can be used to reduce costs.</p>

<p>[Dispatch from Zhenjiang, 2nd] Ding Zuobin, the magistrate of Taixian County, came to Zhenjiang on December 30th of last year and reported on the important government affairs of Taixian in detail to the chairman. On the 31st, he hosted reporters from various newspapers in the provincial capital and reported on the situation he personally witnessed in the bandit areas in great detail, which was alarming. Magistrate Ding said: During the eight days of traveling, most of the villages I passed through had no men, only a few elderly women and children, and eight or nine out of ten were wearing mourning clothes, which shows the cruelty of the bandits in killing the people. The poorest in the village are called "The Old Masters", the next is called "The Second Old Masters,". In the bandit areas, eighteen-year-old girls are hung up and asked for gold and silver. This is called "hanging for gold" and "hanging for silver." The bandits say that gold and silver belong to the country and the common people should not have them. After repeated research, I feel that relying on troops to suppress bandits will not work. Suppressing bandits is everyone's business. The people of the entire Taixian County must cheer up and fight the bandits to the death, otherwise there will be no burial place. I hope everyone can see through this. If the bandits can be wiped out, what does it matter if a few more coins are spent, as long as they are spent properly. I do not only hope that the people of Taixian County will do this, but also hope that the people of the entire Jiangsu Province will unite and become alert.</p>

<h3 id="e83">Before and After "Metrorrhagia" <a href="#e83" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c83" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">83</a></h3>
<p>-- Zhong Li</p>
<p>Metrorrhagia refers to excessive menstruation, like a collapse of a dam, unstoppable, followed by continuous spotting. Therefore, the terms "metrorrhagia and spotting" are often used together. Some may start with spotting and then lead to metrorrhagia. The causes are usually congestion of the uterus, internal tumors, ovarian deterioration, or uterine cancer. After metrorrhagia, one often sees a pale face, dizziness, blurred vision, lower back pain as if broken, weakness of the limbs, insomnia, palpitations, and other symptoms. This disease is more common in middle-aged women. It is occasionally seen in young women, usually caused by strenuous exercise or falls and injuries. Cases around the age of fifty are mostly a sign of uterine tumor or cancer and should not be ignored.</p>
<p>Traditional Chinese medicine treats metrorrhagia by carefully examining the disease and prescribing treatment accordingly, so it is very effective. It can be divided into six points: (1) If the Chong and Ren meridians cannot control blood, symptoms include fear of cold, pale lips and nails, urgently administer ginseng, astragalus, donkey-hide gelatin, mugwort leaves, etc. (2) If the kidneys are weak and cannot contain blood, symptoms include lower back pain, cold feet, palpitations, and confusion. Treatment should warm the kidneys and replenish essence, such as deer antler, human placenta, cynomorium, and purple fluorite. (3) If there is blood deficiency and liver exuberance, symptoms include a pale face, red lips, red cheeks, and a red tongue with cracks, fresh blood with a purple tinge. Medications include raw rehmannia, white peony root, moutan bark, scrophularia, turtle shell, oyster shells, etc. (4) If there is qi deficiency and the body cannot contain blood, use codonopsis, astragalus, eucommia, longan pulp, etc. (5) If there is spleen deficiency and the spleen cannot govern the blood, add atractylodes and costus root to the previous prescription. (6) If there is stagnant blood obstructing internally and new blood cannot return to the meridians, use charred angelica sinensis, charred salvia miltiorrhiza, charred schizonepeta, and charred sophora flavescens. Using medication according to the symptoms will always be effective. After metrorrhagia and spotting have healed, it is especially appropriate to take a tonic formula during this winter season to strengthen the body. It is never too late to mend the fold after the sheep have strayed.</p>
<h3 id="e84">Preventing Boils from Warming by the Stove <a href="#e84" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c84" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">84</a></h3>
<p>— Zhu Renkang</p>
<p>As the saying goes, "Although boils are small, their toxicity is extremely potent." Indeed, they are among the most dangerous external conditions. They occur most frequently on the face and hands. Initially, they appear as small sores, sometimes itchy or painful. One must not disregard them due to their small size, especially if a feeling of numbness is present, which indicates a more serious condition.</p>
<p>Boils on the face, such as those on the nose, philtrum, around the mouth, and cheekbones, are particularly dangerous. These types of boils are strongly related to food poisoning, such as from eating diseased dead pork or beef, or from excessive indulgence in wine and meat. These habits easily lead to boils. If, after contracting a boil, one is not careful with their diet, it can easily lead to the danger of "running yellow" (a severe complication). Therefore, treatment as early as possible is best.</p>
<p>Boils on the hands and fingers, such as "snakehead boils," "tray boils," and those in the "tiger's mouth" (webbing between thumb and index finger), are particularly painful due to the dense network of sensory nerves in the hands. Those who use their hands for work, such as butchers, fishers, farmers, washerwomen, tanners, seamstresses, carpenters, and cooks, are more prone to boils. In ordinary people, they are often triggered by finger pricks or crush injuries.</p>
<p>Boils are also greatly related to the climate. When it hasn't rained for a long time, and the weather is dry and hot, boils are more common. When the weather is dry, children tend to lick their lips, which can cause "inverted cicada" boils (a type of facial boil).</p>
<p>During this winter season, many like to gather around stoves to keep warm. Those who are economically minded may use coal briquette stoves or stay close to gas heaters, both of which contain "fire toxins." Consequently, quite a few people develop boils and seek medical treatment. This is something that urgently needs attention.</p>
<h3 id="e85">Variations of Winter Warm Disease <a href="#e85" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c85" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">85</a></h3>
<p>— Guan Liping</p>
<p>Winter Warm disease is a type of febrile disease, known as such because it aligns with the seasonal climate of winter. The initial symptoms are similar to those of a common cold: aversion to cold, fever, headache, body aches, bone and joint pain, thick phlegm, and subtle chest and rib pain. Due to the underlying dormant factors, it is often not resolved by inducing sweating or a single dose of medication. With proper treatment, mild cases may subside in two to three weeks (each week is called a "候"), while severe cases may take five to six weeks to heal. This type of warm disease cannot be resolved by recklessly inducing sweating. Or, after sweating, the fever may subside slightly, only to rise again after a while.</p>
<p>Winter Warm disease has many variations: (1) Transformation into pneumonia, characterized by coughing with rising phlegm, shortness of breath, pain in the right or left side of the chest, or blood-tinged sputum. Treatment should focus on clearing and moistening with ingredients like Tinglizi (Descurainiae Semen seu Lepidii Semen), gypsum, honeysuckle, forsythia, trichosanthes fruit, glehnia root, and loquat leaf syrup. (2) Transformation into intestinal bleeding, where profuse bleeding is accompanied by impaired consciousness. Rhinoceros horn, fresh rehmannia root, moutan bark, pulsatilla, fraxinus bark, and charred sophora flower should be used to clear the heat and stop the bleeding. If cold limbs, excessive sweating, a thready or submerged pulse, a pale complexion, and weak breathing are observed, it can easily lead to collapse. Ginseng, dragon bone, and oyster shell should be added to fortify the body and rescue it from collapse. If the bleeding is not profuse, the blood is purplish-black, and the patient's mental state remains normal, or if abdominal pain precedes the bleeding, which then subsides, it differs from the above and requires only clearing of the intestines.</p>
<p>(3) Concomitant peritonitis is the most dangerous condition, characterized by severe pain in the lower abdomen, with bowel movements that are either frequent or obstructed. In severe cases, the lower abdomen may be distended. Rhubarb, moutan bark, peach kernel, and patrinia herb should be used to promote blood circulation and resolve stagnation.</p>
<p>(4) Transformation into impaired consciousness, incoherent speech, and delusional talk. Medicines such as Zhizhudan (a traditional Chinese medicine), Chaihudan (another traditional medicine), Shenxidan (a calming medicine), acorus, and aroid should be selected.</p>
<p>(5) Transformation into wind-induced convulsion, with eyes rolled upward and clenched jaws. Antelope horn, abalone shell, and uncaria should be used to treat it.</p>
<p>The above five variations of Winter Warm disease are only general descriptions. The remaining symptoms should be treated according to the judgment of yin syndromes.</p>

<h3 id="e86">A Case of Tetanus Cured with Traditional Chinese Medicine <a href="#e86" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c86" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">86</a></h3>
<p>Previously, I read in the "New Medicine and New Drugs Weekly" an article by Dr. Yang titled "Childbirth and Tetanus," which stated that the mortality rate of tetanus is very high, and that once spasms occur, the effectiveness of serum is limited. This reminded me of a case where my mother contracted this disease and was cured with traditional Chinese medicine. I am recording it here for research purposes. In the spring of the 33rd year of the Republic of China (1944), my mother accidentally fell headfirst from the second floor, her head hitting the lid of a water tank on the ground. A three-inch gash near her temple bled profusely. She fainted immediately, but was revived after emergency treatment by a doctor, who stitched up the wound. After about ten days, it was mostly healed, but suddenly her eyes appeared to be different sizes. Two or three days later, she couldn't open her jaw, and her back, neck, legs, and knees were all stiff. The doctor diagnosed her with tetanus. Despite daily injections of large amounts of tetanus serum, there was no effect. Sedatives and antispasmodic drugs were also ineffective. At that time, she suffered from spasms and convulsions, screaming in agony, and could only have a few drops of water dripped into her mouth to prolong her life. She was in critical condition. On someone's recommendation, we consulted a traditional Chinese medicine practitioner, Zhuang, who prescribed a formula containing arisaema, gastrodia, uncaria, saposhnikovia, notopterygium, cicada slough, angelica dahurica, typhonii rhizoma, areca peel, poria spirit, and antelope horn shavings. After decocting, it was slowly dripped into her mouth through the gaps in her teeth. After several hours, her jaw loosened slightly, and the spasms decreased. Later, the prescription was changed daily, and early in the morning she was out of danger. After a month of recuperation, she fully recovered and remains healthy to this day. The head wound scar is still visible. Therefore, I dare to truthfully present this case for the exploration of the medical community. I would be greatly honored.</p>

<p>Essential Medicines for Gynecology</p>
<h3 id="e87">Angelica (Danggui) <a href="#e87" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c87" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">87</a></h3>
<p>— Zhu He</p>
<p>Angelica (Danggui) is an essential medicine for women's diseases. Since ancient times, it has been recognized for its ability to invigorate and nourish the blood, regulate menstruation, and promote fertility, allowing the qi and blood to return to their proper channels, hence the name "Danggui" (literally, "return to its proper place").</p>
<p>The European and American medical communities have long recognized this and have extracted its essence to investigate its main functions. After consumption and absorption into the blood, it accelerates blood oxidation, thereby enhancing metabolism and raising blood pressure. It can also induce hyperemia in the ovaries, thus verifying its effectiveness in breaking down stagnant blood, nourishing new blood, regulating menstruation, and promoting fertility.</p>
<p>Gynecologists invariably use Danggui. This medicine is often combined with white peony root, chuanxiong rhizome, and rehmannia root to form the famous Si Wu Tang (Four-Substance Decoction) for gynecology. When used alone, decocted with aged wine, it is an effective remedy for dysmenorrhea. Danggui also has different parts: the head, body, and tail. The head of Danggui stops bleeding and moves upward; the body of Danggui tonifies blood and stays in the middle; the tail of Danggui breaks blood and moves downward; and the whole Danggui harmonizes blood without dispersing it. These different uses in traditional Chinese medicine prescriptions demonstrate its precision and effectiveness, surpassing other methods.</p>

<h3 id="e88">Vomiting and Esophageal Obstruction <a href="#e88" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c88" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">88</a></h3>
<p>— Cheng Guoshu</p>
<p>Vomiting and esophageal obstruction both belong to digestive system diseases. Vomiting is milder, while esophageal obstruction is more severe. The world calls "madness, consumption, bloating, and esophageal obstruction" the four major syndromes, esophageal obstruction being one of them, indicating its severity.</p>
<p>With "vomiting," the patient can still eat, but the food is vomited out shortly after or some time later. It can be further distinguished into two types: vomiting immediately after eating, and vomiting in the evening after eating in the morning, or vice versa. Vomiting immediately after eating is caused by spasm, narrowing, or swelling of the upper opening of the stomach (the cardia), preventing food from entering and causing it to be vomited out. Vomiting in the evening after eating in the morning, or vice versa, is caused by the above-mentioned pathologies occurring at the lower opening of the stomach (the pylorus), preventing food from entering the duodenum, thus remaining in the stomach for a longer period before being vomited out. Although patients with this condition can eat, they cannot absorb the nutrients, resulting in a gradual decline in physical strength. Therefore, it is advisable to feed them liquid foods such as milk, such as chive juice and milk drink (chive juice, milk, with a little ginger juice).</p>
<p>In the early stages, before physical strength has deteriorated, with vomiting immediately after eating, the Da Huang Gan Cao Tang (Rhubarb and Licorice Decoction) (rhubarb, licorice) is suitable. For those who vomit in the evening after eating in the morning, or vice versa, the Wu Zhu Yu Tang (Evodia Decoction) (evodia, ginseng, ginger, jujube) is suitable.</p>
<p>"Esophageal obstruction," commonly known as "gas obstruction," actually has distinctions between "obstruction" and "diaphragm." "Obstruction" refers to the narrowing and thinning of the esophagus, making it difficult to swallow food, causing it to be obstructed. "Diaphragm" refers to the presence of an actual obstruction in the esophagus, such as esophageal stricture or cancerous growth, preventing food from passing through.</p>
<p>These conditions are often caused by worry, contemplation, anger, and resentment. Patients can drink liquids, but have difficulty swallowing solids, which differs slightly from vomiting where food is eaten and then vomited out. As for treatment, if it is caused by qi stagnation, the Si Qi Yin (Ginseng, Aucklandia, Betel Nut, Agarwood Decoction) is suitable to promote qi circulation and resolve stagnation. If combined with fluid depletion, the Five Juice Drink (Milk, Chive Juice, Ginger Juice, Lotus Root Juice, Pear Juice) (牛乳，韮汁，姜汁，藕汁，梨汁) is added to generate fluids and nourish the body (or the nourishing enema method can be used). If it is caused by fluid depletion, qi stagnation, and phlegm accumulation, the Da Ban Xia Tang (Pinellia Decoction) (ginseng, pinellia, white honey) is suitable to promote qi circulation, resolve phlegm, and generate fluids. If it is caused by qi stagnation and blood stasis, the Tao Ren Cheng Qi Tang (Peach Kernel Qi-Moving Decoction) (peach kernel, rhubarb, mirabilite, licorice, cinnamon twig) is suitable to dispel stasis and break up stagnation. Although traditional Chinese medicine classics do not mention cancerous growths, using methods to dispel blood stasis to treat cancerous growths is quite consistent.</p>

<p>[Our Report] Students of the Shanghai Municipal Normal School are continuing their strike today to demand reasonable treatment and an increase in the amount of public funding.

The school authorities promised to respond with a solution yesterday, but as of last night, the school authorities had not given a clear indication. The student body held a general meeting and resolved to continue the strike today to show their protest. At the same time, they demanded that the Bureau of Education reissue the remaining public funding for the months of October, November, and December of last year. According to the person in charge of the student union: the monthly public funding for students at the school was originally 83,000 yuan this semester. In December, it was announced that it would be increased to 196,000 yuan starting from October, but this increased amount has not yet been issued.</p>

<h3 id="e98">Six-District Cotton Spinning Association Holds Extraordinary Meeting to Review Cotton Yarn and Cloth Management Regulations, Eager to Cooperate with the Yarn Control Committee to Increase Production, Cotton and Yarn Groups Offer Opinions <a href="#e98" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c98" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">98</a></h3>
<p>[Our Report] Yesterday, the Six-District Cotton Spinning Association convened an extraordinary meeting of its members regarding the implementation of the Cotton Yarn and Cloth Management Regulations. Over a hundred representatives from various factories attended. Chairman Wang Qiyu presided over the meeting, during which the nine articles of the management regulations promulgated by the government were discussed in detail. The main points of the association's opinions are as follows: Under the government's policy of controlling resources and stabilizing prices, the implementation of nationwide cotton yarn and cloth management regulations should be jointly supported by all members of the industry. Chairman Jiang's New Year's Day announcement on stabilizing finance and increasing production is especially admired by all members of the industry. However, the management regulations must consider the survival of businesses to be effectively promoted and achieve the goals of stability and increased production. Issues such as potential disruptions in raw cotton supply leading to factory shutdowns, the calculation of processing fees based on cotton prices, the timing of cotton-for-yarn exchanges, and the varying qualities of equipment are all deeply related to each factory. If these are not carefully considered and implemented, there may be practical difficulties. The general assembly decided to establish separate committees for raw cotton and yarn and cloth to conduct detailed reviews and provide written opinions to the Yarn Control Committee for consideration in the coming days. The meeting lasted for three hours, and many speakers expressed their opinions. All members expressed their sincere willingness to cooperate with the Yarn Control Committee to achieve the goal of increased production.</p>
<h3 id="e99">Yarn Control Committee to Entrust Textile Construction Company with Cotton Purchase Contract, Soon to Be Signed <a href="#e99" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c99" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">99</a></h3>
<p>[Our Report] The contract between the Yarn Control Committee and the Textile Construction Company for the latter to purchase raw cotton on behalf of the former is reportedly finalized and will be signed soon. Key contents include: The raw cotton collection agencies originally set up in various locations by the Textile Construction Company should be accepted for commissioned procurement. For the raw cotton collection location where Textile Construction Company has not set up collection agencies, the Yarn Control Committee is not bound by the contract and may set up its own agency to process raw cotton. In areas where Textile Construction Company is involved in raw cotton collection, Textile Construction Company can purchase raw cotton in spot trading, forward contract trading, through bookkeeping, or through the standard trading approach of the raw cotton merchant, based on factual requirements. It can also commission the purchase to privately-owned factories, which must comply with the standards and classifications as set by Textile Construction Company.</p>
<h3 id="e100">Cotton Yarn Trading Robust, Cloth Market Sentiment Strong <a href="#e100" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c100" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">100</a></h3>
<p>Due to the soaring prices in other ports during the closure of customs, the cotton yarn market was filled with excitement. As soon as trading opened, weaving factories and local merchants actively bought, causing prices to rise uniformly. Midway, the opening of yarn sales by Textile Construction Company slightly softened the market, but strong buying interest ultimately led to the closing price of 42-count Lufeng fine yarn at 54 million yuan, a surge of 3.7 million yuan compared to before the holiday. The prices of other counts of coarse and fine yarns also jumped by 1.56 to 2.45 million yuan. The cloth market opened sharply higher in the morning, with sentiment becoming particularly strong. This was because trading had occurred off-market during the holiday, already raising prices. Consequently, merchants actively sought to cover their positions, and merchants made strong purchases, causing the market to rise in a roundabout way. However, at noon, news spread that cotton purchases would be centrally controlled starting from the 9th, and that the movement of goods would be stopped, with rumors that yarn and cloth would follow suit. Sentiment suddenly softened, with sellers rushing to sell, and Guangbang merchants selling more, causing prices to slightly decline. Nevertheless, the off-market price of the leading fine cloth rose sharply by about 200,000 yuan compared to before the holiday, reaching 1.495 million yuan. Wufu lottery balls and Zhenzhong brands also rose by 120,000 to 167,000 yuan, while jizhi tribute cloth, bleached coarse cloth, twill colored cloth, and local cloth also increased by over 100,000 yuan. [Our Report] Yesterday, China Textile Construction Company sold its allocated cotton yarn as usual, selling 3,144 pieces, totaling 4,065 pieces of 20-count yarn. There were 771 applications. The selling price remained unchanged.</p>
<h3 id="e101">Unified Bonds Stable, Foreign Shares Rise <a href="#e101" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c101" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">101</a></h3>
<p>Government bonds also trended stably yesterday. Unified C bonds opened at 30,000 yuan, reached a high of 31,400 yuan, retreated to 29,900 yuan, and finally stood at 31,000 yuan. Compared to before the closure of customs, A, B, D, and E bonds each rose by 900 yuan, and C bonds rose by 1,000 yuan. Trading volume was approximately 5 million. Foreign shares also saw strong buying interest yesterday. However, due to the partial effectiveness of the Sino-Hong Kong agreement, Shanghai Electric rebounded to 3.1 yuan, rising but not expanding. Yi Sha and Ying Lian reached new highs of 470,000 and 720,000 respectively. Guangbang and foreign firms took profits, while retail investors and securities firms sold, showing a firm process. As a result, compared to before the closure of customs, Wheelock paper remained stable, while hot stocks such as Yi Sha, Ying Lian, Ye Guang, Yi Hua Shipping, and steel stocks each rose by half a percent.</p>
<p>Tea Market Quiet</p>
<p>Both local and merchant customers inquired about inland tea yesterday. Although large firms tried to push up the opening prices, most holders felt tight on funds and sold, making it difficult for the situation to improve. The closing result was that prices generally held steady. As for the foreign tea market, demand from abroad remained sluggish, so trading remained bleak. However, holders of goods remained inactive, so the process remained quiet and unchanged.</p>
<h3 id="e102">Money Market Stable <a href="#e102" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c102" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">102</a></h3>
<p>[Our Report] Yesterday, the money market was stable, with overnight interest rates at 2.4%, and Huagu sticking interest at 2.55%.

<p>Huagu stocks opened red yesterday. Although trading was not active, the available chips were tight. Apart from Yongsha creating a new high of 617 yuan and 627 yuan, the remaining stocks uniformly hit the limit up. Initially, the market was confident, and opened higher. Yongsha opened for immediate delivery at 580 yuan, and for deferred delivery at 595 yuan. After opening, sellers lowered the price of deferred Yongsha to 590 yuan, but it was immediately bought up to 596 yuan and 610 yuan. Midway, it fell to 582 yuan and 595 yuan. At that time, the prices of small stocks were very profitable. Xinyi, Jinglun, Zhongsi, Huameng, Jianhua Underwear and other stocks successively rose to the limit up, and rebounded more easily. Yonggong also reached the limit up. Yongsha rose to 590 yuan and 600 yuan. The market outside offered interest rates of 2.1% and 2.55%, and then retreated to 585 yuan and 597 yuan. Foreign shares remained at higher prices, and Anshan and Ni each hit the limit up. Yongsha then created new highs of 616 yuan and 611 yuan, with limited transactions, and retreated to 586 yuan and 600 yuan by noon. However, the firmness of the small stocks supported the big stocks, and again rose to 591 yuan and 605 yuan at the close. As a result, compared to the spot delivery shares at the closure, Xinyi, Jinglun, Yonggong, Underwear, and Lian each hit the limit up. Huameng, Xinhua, Zhongsi, Baini each retreated after hitting the limit up, rising by 10% to 15%. Wuli rose slightly, and the remaining shares all rose by 5% to 15%.

As a result, compared to the morning session, all stocks except Yongsha, which rose slightly and continued to penetrate, still seeing positive prospects, hit the limit up. All of the old stocks in the informal market were extremely firm, especially Zhonghua, which rose independently by 10%, and Bank of China, which rose by another half a percent, were the most remarkable. Also: Spot delivery arbitrage transactions were cheaper midway yesterday, and the situation was relatively stable. Those with interest rates close to each other could obtain about 1.7 to 2%, internally calculated Yongsha sticking price initially opened at 14 yuan, fell to 12 yuan, and closed at 13.5 yuan. Meiya opened at 22 yuan, reached a high of 30 yuan, and closed at 20 yuan. Xinyi opened at 7 yuan and closed at 8 yuan.</p>

<p>The rayon market soared yesterday. 120-count Asahi brand rayon with luster opened high at 8.5 million yuan, and some transactions were made. It once fell to 3.5 million yuan for next-day delivery, but this was for goods without cases. It then rose again, and by noon it had risen to a selling price of 8 million yuan, with buyers willing to pay 7 million yuan. It continued to be popular in the afternoon. Due to a lack of sellers, it finally rose to 91.5 million yuan, an increase of 13 million yuan compared to last Wednesday.</p>
<p>Factory-Made Silk</p>
<p>Yesterday's market was stimulated by high rayon prices, and sentiment was positive. In the morning, C-grade Chinese-capital goods opened at 89 million yuan, but the asking prices were generally inflated. In the afternoon, prices were even higher than in the morning, and asking prices rose uniformly. High-grade goods were traded for 90 million yuan. Tiger stove silk was around 86 million yuan. 28-point silk was extremely scarce, with asking prices as high as 80 million yuan. Ordinary goods were around 75 million yuan.</p>

High Prices of Rice Fluctuate, Oil Cakes and Miscellaneous Grains Rise</p>
<p>Rice markets operated as usual on January 2nd and 3rd. Ultimately, because various markets were in closure, trading was inevitably oversupplied, resulting in a combined increase of 100,000 to 200,000 yuan over two days. Yesterday, all grains were returned to the market in full. The combined registration of rice grains from the north and south markets reached around 19,000 shi. Market conditions: The south market initially fell and then rose, ultimately being about the same as Saturday. The north market was sluggish and fell back by 10,000 to 20,000 yuan. Suzhou rice ships were congested, with abundant supply and no concerns. Other oil cakes, miscellaneous grains, and wheat bran all saw increases of 10% to 20%. Flour sharply increased by 60,000 to 70,000 yuan, and wheat bran inventories were extremely depleted, causing prices to rise wildly by 80,000 to 90,000 yuan. Soybean cakes rose by 20,000 to 30,000 yuan due to the high cost of raw materials. Soybean transactions were not smooth. Because supply and demand did not match, merchant confidence was strong, causing prices to rise by 50,000 to 60,000 yuan. However, actual sales were flat, and prices weakened again near the close. The supply and demand of rapeseed was low, and holders were firm, causing prices to rise wildly by 100,000 yuan. Red beans came and went quickly, and holders were very firm, causing prices to rise by 10,000 yuan. Adzuki beans similarly rose by 50,000 to 60,000 yuan. Broad beans rose by 60,000 to 70,000 yuan in line with other goods. There were no recent shipments of chickpeas, and there were no formal market conditions. Northern sorghum continued to be processed, rising by 70,000 to 80,000 yuan, but weakening at noon. Northern rice continued to be purchased, rising sharply by 100,000 yuan. Raw peanuts were sold retail briskly, and prices continued to rise, jumping by 200,000 yuan. Sesame seeds and wood were traded actively, rising by a few million yuan. All oil markets were high, and all oils rose in price by 100,000 to 200,000 yuan or more.</p>
<h3 id="e105">Fuel Management Committee Adjusts Prices for Various Coal Allocations Starting This Month, Efforts to Open Up All Coal Sources Are Underway <a href="#e105" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c105" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">105</a></h3>
<p>[Our Report] The Fuel Management Committee has adjusted coal price allocations starting January of this year. Overall, prices have increased by about 40% compared to the previous period. The prices are as follows (per ton):</p>
<p>(A) Public utilities: 2.18 million yuan for dock delivery, 2.15 million yuan for full ship delivery. (B) Railways, military transport: 2.42 million yuan for dock delivery. (C) Outport power plants, ships, transportation organizations under the jurisdiction of the municipal public utilities bureau, divided into eight levels, ranging from 2.42 million yuan to 2.75 million yuan. (D) Factories, military and government agencies, divided into eight levels, ranging from 3.14 million yuan to 3.47 million yuan. (E) Foreign coal: Public utilities: 3.54 million yuan for coal dust, 3.88 million yuan for coal chunks; factory coal: 3.98 million yuan for coal dust, 4.4 million yuan for coal chunks. (F) White coal: 1.99 million yuan for Great Wall coal dust, 3.97 million yuan for Great Wall coal chunks, 2.88 million yuan for other coal dust, less than 4 million yuan for other coal pieces, 4.91 million yuan for other coal pellets, and 6.03 million yuan for other coal chunks. The above coal prices for items C, D, E, and F are all for delivery at the Pudong dock or the Maigen Road warehouse, with an additional 180,000 yuan per ton. According to a spokesperson for the Fuel Management Committee: Recently, in the northern segment of the rail line, the route inside Customs has been destroyed by bandits three times. The opening of coal transport has been affected, and it has not yet been fully unblocked, affecting demand in the southeast region. This committee, which is responsible for fuel management, should prepare to open up coal sources to meet the demand for coal from public utilities, railways, ships, and other major coal users. Chairman Zhang of this committee flew to Taiwan on the 1st to discuss the shipping of coal from Taiwan to Shanghai. It is expected that monthly transport can increase by 40,000 to 50,000 tons. Furthermore, Director Wu Tao of the Shipping Office was assigned on the 2nd to Qilu Road Xuzhou and Bengbu to procure coal from the Huainan and Huadong Coal Mines. Regarding the increase in coal shipping along Qilu Road, the Ministry of Economic Affairs and the Ministry of Transportation have reached an agreement to immediately allocate seven special coal transport trains, which are expected to transport 150,000 tons of coal to Beijing and Shanghai this month for urgent use. In addition to the above two methods of increasing transport, Premier Zhang of the Executive Yuan has also approved the purchase of 100,000 tons of foreign coal, which this committee will negotiate with the National Bank regarding foreign exchange limits, and then entrust it to the Central Trust Bureau for handling. Currently, before the increased coal shipment arrives, this committee has received a hand-signed order from Minister Chen of the Ministry of Economic Affairs, stating: Currently, coal transportation is obstructed, and the Ministry is working to clear it. Before coal shipments are fully unblocked, all coal originally intended for the Fuel Management Committee, except for public utilities, outport power plants, ships, railways, dredging, military transport, and state-owned factories, must be temporarily suspended from allocation." This committee will spare no effort to overcome all difficulties to overcome the current difficulties.</p>
<p>(Another report) The committee also shipped 4,300 tons of coal on the Jiaoda Zhonghua ship from Qinhuangdao to the Qingdao Power Plant. On the 8th, the Fuxiang ship will transport 5,000 tons of coal from Shanghai to Qingdao, with 3,000 tons delivered to the Zhongfang Textile Factory and 2,000 tons delivered to the Coal Transportation Mine Office for distribution to railways, navy, customs, and other major special agencies.</p>

<h3 id="e107">Clarifying Virtue, Renewing the People, and Abiding in Perfect Goodness <a href="#e107" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c107" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">107</a></h3>
<p>— Junyang</p>
<p>"Clarifying virtue" means clarifying the reason for clarifying virtue. When discussing the worthies, "clarifying virtue" is read twice in succession. Zhu Xi's interpretation of the first "clarifying" is "to clarify," and he says that "clarifying virtue is what people receive from Heaven, and it is vacuous and spiritually bright, possessing all principles and mastering all affairs." This interpretation can be understood. Virtue is clarified through vacuity and spiritual brightness, and this vacuity and spiritual brightness does possess all principles and master all affairs. However, virtue resides within, and its mechanism is limited to vacuity and spiritual brightness. As for the multitude of principles and the myriad of affairs, they lie outside and require the effort of learning, inquiry, deliberation, and discrimination before they can be possessed and responded to. This effort of learning, inquiry, deliberation, and discrimination is what Zhu Xi calls "to clarify." I believe that this so-called "virtue" or "clarifying virtue" is what the Doctrine of the Mean calls "universal virtue" or "virtuous nature." "Universal" means comprehensive, truly encompasses the meaning of "clarifying." "Virtue" means obtaining, what people obtain from Heaven as their nature. What is universal virtue? Knowledge, benevolence, and courage. These three are the vacuous and spiritually bright virtues that people obtain from Heaven, inherent within. When connected to the external world, knowledge possesses all principles, and benevolence and courage respond to all affairs, completing the functions of knowledge and action.</p>
<p>"Renewing the people" was originally "loving the people." Cheng Yi said that "loving" should be "renewing," and Zhu Xi's commentary follows suit. From the beginning of the Great Learning to "never has there been a case of valuing what is unimportant while neglecting what is important," which Zhu Xi calls the "classic," is clearly the outline of the entire text. What Zhu Xi analyzes as the "commentary" always begins with the classic and ends here. There is a section on renewing the people in the text (Zhu Xi's commentary, chapter 2), but the phrase "renewing the people" does not appear in the preceding general section (Zhu Xi's classic). This shows that "loving the people" in the general section is a transcription error due to the similarity in sound and form between "loving" and "renewing." As for Yangming's claim that "the 'renewing' in 'renewing the people' is different from the 'renewing' in 'self-renewal,' how can this be relied upon?" It is not known that the "renewing" in "renewing the people" contains the meaning of self-renewal. "Renewing the people" means that the ruler clarifies his own virtue, then extends it to others, so that his people may also clarify their own virtues. "Clarifying virtue throughout the world" means enabling the people of the world to clarify their own clarifying virtue, hence the citation of the Kang Gao and the Tai Jia (Zhu Xi's commentary, chapter 1), followed by "all are self-clarifying." "Self-clarifying" is the same as self-renewal. Considering the clarifying virtue in the Great Learning, it is a matter of following one's nature, while renewing the people is the work of cultivating the Way. Cultivating the Way means that the ruler enables the people to cultivate their Way, in order to restore the naturalness of their natures and responsibilities. This is the true meaning of teaching. The ruler teaches the people not by imposing from the outside, but by first cultivating himself. Then, what is within him is enriched, and when it emanates outwards, the people are moved by it, all rising up and engaging in self-cultivation. Confucius said, "To govern with virtue is like the North Star, abiding in its place while all the other stars revolve around it" (Analects, Wei Zheng chapter). These words can be used to illuminate this point. Yangming also said, "Below, the sections on governing the state and pacifying the world all speak of the meaning of 'loving' in 'renewing,' such as 'sharing the pleasures and benefits of the people,' 'like caring for infants,' 'loving what the people love, hating what the people hate, this is what it means to be the parents of the people.'" I ask, is governing and pacifying not a matter of renewing the people? It is necessary to cause the people to renew themselves before the state can be governed and the world can be pacified. If the people cannot renew themselves, then even if they are forcibly unified through politics and punishment, even if governance and peace are achieved, it will not last long. As for Yangming's citations of honoring the worthy, loving one's relatives, caring for infants, etc., saying that they all express the meaning of "loving," I say, how can it not be so? Renewing the people is the work of teaching the people, and teaching the people emphasizes moral transformation. The ruler's virtue of transforming the people is only benevolence, and there is no way to practice benevolence other than loving the people. Now, governing and pacifying are matters of renewing the people, and renewing the people is the work of teaching the people. Then, is it not appropriate to emphasize the meaning of loving the people when discussing governing and pacifying? In short, renewing the people is the aim of governing, and loving the people is the method of governing. Loving the people is the means to renew the people, and renewing the people is the effect of loving the people. Therefore, it is said that if we read "loving the people" as "renewing the people" following Cheng Yi, then its meaning is broader, and the meaning of loving the people is also contained within it. Thus, the contention between Zhu and Wang is all about something that is not really there.</p>
<p>Perfect Goodness is the ultimate principle and truth of all things, which the Doctrine of the Mean calls "sincerity." People's thoughts and actions, as seen in their dealings with people and affairs, should all be based on the ultimate principle and truth, without the faults of excess or deficiency. This is what is called "the Mean." The effect of clarifying virtue on knowledge is the recognition of this principle, which is knowledge. On action, it is benevolence that embodies this principle, and courage that promotes this principle. Clarifying virtue means clarifying the virtues of knowledge, benevolence, and courage within one's nature, so that one may recognize the ultimate principle and truth of heaven and earth, and base one's thoughts and actions upon it. Reason leads to the realm where one should abide. This realm where one should abide, though divided into "multitude of principles" and "myriad of affairs," has only one ultimate principle and truth. This one is nothing other than the consistent Way between heaven and earth, which the Doctrine of the Mean calls "not being divided into two things."</p>
<h3 id="e108">Urban Environment and Criminal Behavior <a href="#e108" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c108" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">108</a></h3>
<p>— Fang Zheng</p>
<p>Most penologists in the past tended towards theories of innate criminality, such as Lombroso's theory of the criminal type, or Tredgold's theory of innate moral deficiency. Recently, sociologists' views have undergone a major shift, and the influence of the environment is gradually being emphasized. This is also due to the gradual rise of human ecology (see Mr. Zhang Qiyun's article in the second issue of this publication) in the history of thought.</p>
<p>Since the publication of Burgess's monograph "The City" in 1925, research in Urban Ecology has flourished. Urban populations are highly mobile. People coming from the countryside may initially be extremely poor and crowded into slums. Through hard work and thrift, their economic status gradually improves, and their living places also change accordingly, perhaps over two or three decades, or one or two generations. Some of these people may even climb from the bottom to the top of the social ladder. As a result, the essence is still these people, but the environment before and after is not the same. This material is most suitable for the study of environmental forces, because under such circumstances, genetic factors can be regarded as constant. Sociologist C.R. Shaw and his school of scholars conducted a study on criminals and the urban environment in Chicago.</p>
<p>They first divided the entire city of Chicago into several districts, and then analyzed the distribution of the backgrounds of 9,243 young offenders based on police court records. The result was that the percentage was highest in slums (close to the city center), lowest in suburban areas, and gradually decreased in a regular manner in intermediate zones. This very regular regional distribution cannot but make people believe that the environment is closely related to criminal behavior. However, possible explanations need not all be environmental determinism. Because this distribution pattern may be innate, that is, those who are psychologically unsound and have low intelligence originally concentrate in slums, the so-called "birds of a feather flock together," and the same unsound types first gather in the lower class areas, rather than the lower class areas making the residents of that area become lower class. Who is the cause and who is the effect must first be studied.</p>
<p>Tulchin, in his 1939 book "Intelligence and Crime," proved that criminals are not necessarily less intelligent than law-abiding people in the same environment, and Dunham further proved that criminals are not necessarily more psychologically unsound than ordinary people. In addition, many research conclusions point to the fact that the psychology of criminals is very close to normal. Furthermore, the same ethnic group has more criminals in slums, and the farther they move out, the smaller the percentage of criminals. This is truly "the spring water is clear in the mountains, but turbid when it leaves the mountains." What does the clarity of the spring water have to do with the water itself?</p>
<p>If we ask why the crime rate is higher in downtown areas and lower in rural areas? The temptations of urban material life are certainly an important reason, but the disintegration of social organization may be a more important crux. In a small town or village, everyone seems to have close ties with the entire community, truly "helping each other in times of trouble and watching out for each other," and personal joys and sorrows are also the joys and sorrows of everyone. After a person enters a big city, he no longer has these connections, and he seems to be an isolated member. Therefore, in the countryside, the power of the community will make his behavior social; in the "uprooted stalk and floating duckweed" metropolis, the power of the community no longer exists intimately, and he dares to act recklessly without any scruples. In other words, in a small place, a person still cares about face and considers social criticism; in a big city, no one respects his face, and he is not afraid of social criticism. Otherwise, the police force in cities is far superior to that in rural areas, so why are there more criminals in cities than in rural areas?</p>
<p>Furthermore, the disintegration of customs and habits in big cities is also an important reason. In large cities, especially in areas where slums are concentrated, people from all directions and all walks of life gather together, and there are different customs and habits. The disparity in standards makes everyone question the traditional morality they are accustomed to. The chaos of morality and the loss of standards of ethics make many people unable to distinguish between right and wrong, and unable to avoid good and evil. This naturally promotes criminal behavior. In addition, criminal behavior is mostly seen and heard, and those who have already lost their opinions are more likely to go astray. Why in this area where dirt and filth are hidden, do some people take advantage of this to make money and organize criminal gangs, systematically educating and promoting these criminal behavior?</p>
<p>This is not an incomprehensible thing either, why the more concentrated the population, the more numb the social consciousness. People living in a small place consider neighborliness a virtue, so neighbors are as concerned as relatives. But a person living in an apartment in New York or Shanghai is also unfamiliar with his neighbors. On the one hand, this is indeed due to the large mobility of the urban population, and on the other hand, it is due to the excessive frequency of social stimulation, which makes social consciousness numb instead. Therefore, from a dense slum to a suburban residential area, the number of people who interact with each other decreases, social stimulation is sparse, and a person is more concerned about the joys and sorrows of his neighbors, the collective consciousness of society increases, and criminal behavior decreases. Therefore, in addition to imitation, social consciousness is a major cause of crime, and all of this can be explained by the environment.</p>
<h3 id="e109">Hocking on Individualism <a href="#e109" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c109" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">109</a></h3>
<p>— Liren</p>
<p>American philosopher Professor W. E. Hocking has discussed individualism in detail in his book "The Lasting Elements of Individualism." The book gives a fairly detailed account of the pros and cons of individualism. Recently, in his article "Value of the Comparative Study of Philosophy," he has made several remarks involving individualism, which are worthy of our attention. Here, we will selectively introduce his remarks as follows:</p>
<p>Hocking believes that individualism is a slogan in the West. Westerners regard individualism as an ideal, and have more or less incorporated it into the Western legal system. Although Westerners dare not say that they have in fact regarded individuals as sacred, Western law is based on the assumption that individuals have equal rights before the law. At the same time, the system of civil rights and democratic politics is also derived from this point. However, the basis of equal rights of individuals is the equal value of individuals. Does the West in fact attach equal (and "sacred") value to every individual? Hocking believes that this is the problem. The criticism of Western culture by our countrymen takes this as an excuse. Chinese critics have said that Westerners who come to the East often boast of the sacred rights of individuals, but American streetcar companies kill many people every year, and the company authorities refuse to install safety barriers on the streetcars, because the cost of installing such barriers is more than the compensation fees paid by the company every year. It can be seen that in reality, Westerners regard life as a few dollars and cents. What "sacredness" of the individual is just emotion, not principle. Hocking did not refute this criticism, which is tantamount to tacitly acknowledging it.</p>
<p>Secondly, Hocking believes that regarding the individual as the absolute unit of social life, as the source of all rights and powers, is also inconsistent with social facts. In fact, in addition to individual rights, there are also group rights. Failure to recognize group rights is sufficient to weaken the organic life of the country. Therefore, the result of excessive development of individualism actually undermines the unity of collective action and emotion. The demand for individual rights often ignores the sense of public obligation. Hocking believes that this point is also worth considering.</p>
<p>Hocking's above criticism, the first point, points out that Western individualism is not strictly serious, that is, it does not seriously regard everyone as sacred. The second point points out that the drawbacks of individualism are sufficient to destroy the common life of groups or countries. These two criticisms seem to be what people who talk about individualism today should pay attention to.</p>
<h3 id="e110">The Object of Aesthetic Appreciation <a href="#e110" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c110" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">110</a></h3>
<p>— Han Yuwen</p>
<p>— A Summary of Bosanquet's Aesthetics, Part 3 —</p>
<p>We have said that the simplest aesthetic experience is a pleasant feeling, or the feeling generated for something that is pleasing. In this sense, anything that can evoke pleasant feelings can serve as an object of aesthetic appreciation. From a simple pebble, babbling stream to elegant music, magnificent drama, all can be objects of aesthetic appreciation.</p>
<p>But not all pleasant feelings are aesthetic. Aesthetic feelings must be stable, or permanent; common, or able to be shared and communicated; and related to an object. Pleasure without an object is not an aesthetic feeling. At the same time, aesthetic feeling must arise from or be based on the object itself and cannot be based on anything outside the object. For example, the reason why a stream is an object of aesthetic appreciation is that it is pleasing to the eye and pleasing to the ear. The richness of its shape, color, sound, and reverberation is where the aesthetic mind rests, and where its emotions are entrusted. It is an end in itself, not a means. If you cannot have an aesthetic feeling for the stream itself, but think that it can irrigate fields or bathe in it before you become interested in it, then your pleasure is practical, not aesthetic.</p>
<p>Based on the above three principles to examine the object of aesthetic appreciation, we know that the aesthetic feeling brought by food or taste is the least. Just think, a bowl of rice or a plate of food, when you are full, do you still enjoy eating it? This means that the pleasure of eating and drinking is not stable. Wine is relatively playable, but its emotion is not very stable, and it is too subjective and difficult to communicate. Regarding shape and form, it must be able to convey a surface curve or style, and only when it has a dynamic nature does it have aesthetic feeling, otherwise it is also uninteresting. Generally speaking, aesthetic feeling arises from seeing and hearing, and shape, color, and tone are the main objects of aesthetic appreciation.</p>
<p>The shapes, colors, tones, etc. mentioned here are naturally representations in the aesthetic mind, rather than independent realities or formless nature; because anything that cannot be contemplated or represented is not conducive to the realization of emotions, that is, it cannot become an aesthetic object. At the same time, this representation is a perceptual or imaginative representation, not a knowledge phenomenon. For example, an aesthetic image is not just a spatial image in geometry; aesthetic colors and tones are not just colors and sounds in physics. The object recognized by science is an abstract, mechanical, quantitative relationship, or a dead material trace. For example, the water recognized by science is hydrogen dioxide, clouds are water vapor in the air, and mountains are accumulations of minerals, etc. Although the aesthetic mind does not necessarily reject these traces, it can penetrate these traces and reach their essence; for example, in water, it sees its flowing, dynamic, and lively, and it is condensed without being stagnant; in clouds, it sees its detached, unrestrained, and contented; in mountains, it sees its solemn, majestic, still, and ever-new, etc., every grass and every stone is nothing but a revelation of the secrets of heaven and an expression of life. This is the true object of aesthetic appreciation. It is a still and contemplative representation, but it is realistic, truthful, complete, and integrated. It is a unity of subject and object, a blending of spirit and form, and a manifestation of reason and emotion. It transcends all common and natural or real things. All worldly knowledge, such as historical records, causal explanations, component analyses, and market price estimations, are irrelevant to it.</p>

<p>— Xie Youwei</p>
<p>—Russell's Autobiography, Part 2—</p>
<p>The childhood of the British philosopher Bertrand Russell has been described in the previous article (Issue 3 of this publication). This great contemporary thinker first studied mathematics. How he turned from mathematics to philosophy, and the changes in his philosophical thoughts, he himself has a fairly detailed autobiography. Now, we will introduce it again based on his autobiography.</p>
<p>After Russell went to Cambridge University, his life changed greatly. He found many friends who could talk about academics. He and many friends with similar interests often gathered to chat. Every Saturday night, they often talked late into the night. The next day, Sunday, after they had breakfast together, they went for a walk all day. They talked about everything, in addition to what they were studying, poetry, philosophy, politics, and ethics were also topics of conversation. At that time, they felt that "the world seemed solid and hopeful." They were all convinced that the progress of the nineteenth century could continue, and that they themselves could each make valuable contributions. Russell believed that the happiness of that period was unimaginable to the young people after the Great War of 1914. Whitehead (A.N. Whitehead), who wrote "Principia Mathematica". Whitehead was a few years older than Russell. When Russell entered Cambridge, Whitehead was already a researcher and lecturer. The second was McTaggart, who was famous for studying Hegel's philosophy. The third was Moore (G.E. Moore), who was famous for refuting idealism. In addition, the Davasa brothers, who had jointly translated Plato's "Republic", and Charles Sanger, a mathematician, were his close friends.</p>
<p>Russell said that during the four years of painting at Cambridge, he studied mathematics for the first three years. All his energy was spent on mathematics, and he had no time to read philosophy books. It was not until the fourth year that he began to study philosophy. At that time, there were three teachers who taught him philosophy: one was Henry Sidgwick, who was famous for his book "The Methods of Ethics", and he represented the British philosophical point of view. The second was James Ward, who proposed Kant's system and introduced Russell to the books of Lotze and Sigwart. The third was G.F. Stout, who praised F.H. Bradley very much, and believed that Bradley's book "Appearance and Reality" did the work that humans could do on ontology. He studied philosophy for a year, but he did not decide to specialize in philosophy. He left Cambridge in 1894. After leaving Cambridge, he worked as an attache at the British Embassy in Paris for several months. He was not satisfied with this work and soon resigned. After resigning, he got married. After marriage, he lived in Berlin for almost a year, studying economics and German social democratic thought. Later, he traveled to the United States. After returning to China from his trip, he closed the door to read books, reading mathematics and philosophy during the day, and reciting history aloud at night.</p>
<p>Russell became involved with mathematics at the age of eleven, and he spent most of his time studying mathematics at Cambridge. Why did he turn from mathematics to philosophy? According to his autobiography, there seem to be two reasons: one is that he discovered that he had sufficient ability to study philosophy. His thesis for the researcher's scholarship, on the basis of geometry, was highly praised by Walter and Whitehead. He said that without their encouragement, he would have studied economics instead of philosophy. The second is that he first got the opportunity to teach philosophy at the university. In 1998, McTaggart, who was supposed to teach Leibniz's philosophy at Cambridge University, asked Russell to substitute for this course because he was going to New Zealand to visit his relatives. Russell agreed. After the lecture, he wrote a book "Philosophy of Leibniz" (1900). He thought that this book was fortunate for him, otherwise he might not have specialized in philosophy.</p>
<p>Regarding his philosophical views, he initially tended towards idealism. When he was studying at Cambridge, his thoughts were greatly influenced by McTaggart and Stout. McTaggart introduced him to the philosophy of Hegel. He prompted him to believe that British empiricism was superficial, and that the depth of Hegel's philosophy was unmatched by Locke, Berkeley, Hume, and Mill. Stout urged him to study Bradley's philosophy. At this time, he can be said to be a follower of the Hegelian school. He read that one day in 1894, he was walking on Trinity Lane at Cambridge University, and suddenly he had a flash of inspiration, and he felt that the "Ontological argument" was correct. He went out to buy a can of tobacco, and when he came back, he threw the tobacco can into the air, caught it, and shouted: "My God! The ontological argument is right." At this time, he was reading Bradley's books very enthusiastically. Among modern philosophers, Bradley was the one he admired the most. This idealistic tendency of his lasted for several years, until it was abandoned in 1898. The main reason why he abandoned idealism was the influence of Moore. Moore, like him, had once been a believer in Hegel's philosophy. Moore was the first to oppose idealism, and Russell followed him. Both of them were dissatisfied with Bradley's theory at that time. Bradley believed that everything that common sense believes is a phenomenon, not reality. The two of them went to the other extreme, believing that everything that common sense assumes to be true is true. They even believed that even if no one saw it, the grass was still green, the sun and stars still existed, and they believed that there was a world of many eternal Platonic ideals. In this way, Russell turned from idealism to the camp of new realism.</p>
<p>We all know that Russell's contribution to philosophy seems to be not in his pure philosophy, but in his mathematical logic. The "Principia Mathematica" co-authored with Whitehead, regardless of its shortcomings, has become the "Bible" for modern researchers of mathematical logic. Almost anyone who studies mathematical logic, without reading this book, is not qualified to talk about this discipline. Why did he have the plan to write this book? According to his autobiography, it was like this: in 1900, he participated in the World Philosophy Conference held in Paris. At the conference, he met the Italian mathematician Peano. He felt that the thoughts and words of Peano and his disciples were extremely accurate. He asked Peano to give him the book. Peano gave it to him. He returned to study it carefully, and after becoming familiar with his symbols, he discovered new symbols about "Relations". He asked Whitehead to cooperate to write the book "Principia Mathematica". Whitehead agreed. The first volume of this book was published in 1910, which laid the foundation for Russell's academic status.</p>

<p>— Winter Clothing Donation Drive</p>
<p>Jing Wen</p>
<p>The winter clothing donation drive recently launched by the Shanghai student community can be said to be the most meaningful event in Shanghai society in 1947.</p>
<p>I have always been most afraid of listening to the sermons of high-minded idealists. In the eyes of these people, the work of relief and charity is meaningless, because relief and charity cannot make up for the deformed relations of the current society, and charity is just a social morbidity. Can you save all the poor people in the world? What's more, many beggars are born with "cheap bones", and giving them alms is just harming them...</p>
<p>Theoretically speaking, their theory is indeed the most thorough, but in terms of human nature, their intentions are the most terrible. Because, without asking whether this theory is entirely correct, to obliterate the facts before one's eyes because of theory, to turn a blind eye to the tragic scenes of human life, and to regard humanitarian behavior as a psychological weakness of certain people, their intentions are unbearable to hear!</p>
<p>One of the noblest characteristics of mankind is compassion. Compassion alone may not solve the root problem, but compared with those who are obsessed with lofty ideals and empty talk and are indifferent to reality, people with compassion are ultimately more beneficial to the well-being of real society.</p>
<p>This time, the winter clothing drive launched by Shanghai students, with thousands and tens of thousands of pieces of old cotton clothing, may not solve the long-term living problems of hundreds of thousands of poor people, but compared with those who sing "behind vermilion gates, meat and wine are left to rot, while on the road lie frozen corpses", and only cast a indifferent glance at the human beings who are waiting to die from hunger and cold under the reed mats in the humble alleys, can you bear to say that it is completely meaningless?</p>
<p>The winter clothing drive not only brings some warmth to the bodies of the poor, but also gives them some spiritual warmth. Many people may unconsciously hide a "heart" in themselves that has long been hardened by the tempering of daily life. In the downtown area, we see activities of snatching cold rice almost every day, and from time to time we see abandoned babies or corpses on the deserted roads. Foreigners who come to Shanghai for the first time are all surprised to see this phenomenon, but most Shanghai people have long regarded it as a "routine", because their "hearts" have long been hardened by the environment.</p>
<p>The definition of "heart". Apart from a heart in the physiological sense, it is originally difficult to make a judgment. However, it is probably not wrong to regard compassion as a high manifestation of psychological and spiritual nature. The students in Shanghai, as well as the rickshaw pullers and pedicab drivers who helped the students to transport winter clothing for free, showed this valuable compassion in this voluntary action of soliciting winter clothing for their poor compatriots. And what is more commendable is that this act of righteousness not only brought some benefits to the frozen and starving people, but also taught the students themselves a practical sociology course.</p>
<p>A certain Western newspaper said in a feature article that the students in this city discovered a "new world" in this winter clothing drive. This is correct. Although the students in Shanghai also know that there is a large group of poor people in our society, but after all, how poor, how they live their lives, I am afraid they may not have known in the past, thinking that people who eat pancakes and fried dough sticks every day are already extremely poor. But now they have discovered from the "new world" that there are even poorer people who regard pancakes and fried dough sticks as luxury foods, and reed mats and tattered cotton as "golden houses"! Can you say that this is not the most practical sociology course?</p>
<p>Intellectuals often have a common problem, that is, they can talk but cannot act, or they are afraid to act. Especially the intellectuals in our country, who have always been heavily burdened by the hat of "scholars", so they tend to be more extreme in theory and more isolated from real life. Although the student movement in China has tried to contact real society many times since the May Fourth Movement, it has repeatedly been beaten back by disputes over theories and doctrines. Although this student winter clothing drive was not as sensational as previous student movements, it has more real social significance. Because it helped a part of the poor to barely survive the cold winter, and it also helped to awaken the human compassion that was about to be extinguished.</p>
<h3 id="e112">The Beard of Jin Wuzhu <a href="#e112" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c112" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">112</a></h3>
<p>— Zheng Guoyi</p>
<p>The novel "Yue Zhuan" is the most flawed. Its narratives often fabricate and distort the facts, straying far from the truth. However, the common people love it and regard it as a masterpiece. Consequently, the story of Yue's mother tattooing words on his back has become a popular tale for later generations. Even scholars often mention it in their writings and conversations, which is especially ridiculous! (When visiting the temple of Prince Yue of E, I saw a casual conversation that also touched upon this matter. It is evident that these people only enjoy novels and do not read books. A magnificent temple filled with such folk tales from Qi Dong is something the readers do not perceive, further making people laugh uncontrollably. Unfortunately, as years have passed, the author and the original sentence are no longer remembered.) Reading history books, one has never said that Yue Fei's devotion to the country came from his mother's teachings. Even Yue Ke's "Jin Tuo Cui Bian," which praised his ancestor (Fei) in great detail, does not mention Yue's mother at all. One wonders how Madam Yao (Yue's mother) attained such a great reputation after her death. Furthermore, Song Dynasty scholars have repeatedly stated that Yue Fei was a reincarnation of a pig spirit, which is why he ultimately suffered a violent death. Although this is speculation, it can provide material for conversation. The novel "Yue Zhuan" describes Yue Fei as a Roc bird descending to earth, which corresponds to the names "Fei" and "Peng Ju." This is completely unfounded. As for the story of Jin Wuzhu being the reincarnation of a red-bearded dragon, it lacks even more substance. However, since he is portrayed as a red dragon, he should naturally have a beard. However, the actors who play Wuzhu in various scenes, from Hong'an Zhou to Fengbo Pavilion, never have a beard, as if Wuzhu were beardless. This does not match the image of a "red beard." I recently read "Jin Shi Ji Shi Ben Mo," which quotes Xue Yingqi's "Tong Jian," mentioning that Wuzhu cut off his beard to escape during the battle of Heishiyuan. This not only proves that Wuzhu had a beard, but also that Wuzhu cut it off. Few people know this. Therefore, I present this excerpt to correct the mistaken portrayal of Wuzhu in dramas.</p>
<p>Ping Yingqi's "Tong Jian" states: "Wu Jie carefully assessed the number of soldiers. He repeatedly defeated the Jin soldiers at Heishiyuan, accumulating grain, repairing weapons, and preparing to defend to the death... Wuzhu gathered more than 100,000 soldiers from various tribes, built a pontoon bridge across the Wei River, and set up a fortified camp from Jiji to Yunzhu, building stone walls to confront the official army. Although attacking Heishiyuan, Jie and his younger brother fired arrows in shifts, forming a 'resident team,' with arrows flying continuously. When the enemy retreated slightly, they used surprise attacks from the flanks to cut off their supply lines. Predicting their eventual exhaustion and retreat, they set up an ambush at Shenlei. When the enemy reached the ambush, they were thrown into great confusion. They then launched a night attack, inflicting a great defeat. Wuzhu barely escaped with his life, shaving off his beard and mustache as he fled."</p>
<p>Since Wuzhu started attacking the Song Dynasty, he suffered the greatest losses in Liu Qi's victory at Shunchang and in this battle. Wu Jie's defense of Sichuan was crucial to the survival of the Southern Song Dynasty. The Battle of Heishiyuan was a matter of life and death, with significant consequences. Furthermore, Wuzhu had a desperate moment of cutting off his beard, which could be depicted. However, neither novels nor dramas have taken this into account, which has prevented Wu Jie's name from becoming widely known among the common people. This is the misfortune of Prince Fu (Wu Jie). "Romance of the Three Kingdoms" describes how Emperor Wu of Wei (Cao Cao) also cut off his beard to escape from Ma Chao, which is a fabrication. It is likely based on this story. However, people only know about Cao Cao cutting off his beard, and not about Wuzhu's incident. This study reveals the source of the "Romance of the Three Kingdoms"'s embellishments. Furthermore, in the portraits of Yue Zhongwu Wang of the Song Dynasty, Yue Wang actually has no beard. However, in dramas, except for the scene of spear-picking Little Prince Liang, all actors portraying Yue Fei have beards (even the statues in the Yue Temple in West Lake have overly long beards. If that's the case in the temple, there's even less to say about the dramas.) Wuzhu should have a beard but doesn't, while Yue Fei shouldn't have a beard but does. This is also an interesting anecdote.</p>
<h3 id="e113">Remembering "Changdian" (Part 1) <a href="#e113" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c113" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">113</a></h3>
<p>— Ji Yong</p>
<p>Just as the New Year was approaching, I suddenly saw the news of another fire at the Beijing Normal College, and my heart sank again. Although I have been away from the old capital for more than ten years, the feelings are increasingly intimate. Moreover, I had a four-year relationship with this school. People who have lived in Beijing for a long time probably know about the "fires" at the Normal University. In my memory, there have been at least four major fires, each resulting in considerable losses. The most recent one was in the winter of 1933, fifteen years ago. In terms of fires, it seems too frequent. In terms of life and world affairs, it is also a period of continuous change. Over the past fifteen years, it fits Du Fu's words: "Hearing that Chang'an is like a game of chess, a hundred years of world affairs are filled with sadness. The mansions of princes and nobles all have new masters, and the clothes and hats of civil and military officials are different from the past." Moreover, thinking of "classmates who were young and not humble," one will feel even more melancholy. Some people say that the Normal University is located on the old site of the Fire God Temple. Once destroyed, the god will naturally be angry. This cannot be verified, but not far from here is another Fire God Temple, the so-called Cultural Commercial Center. Because of this, one cannot help but think of Changdian, the most lively New Year market in Beijing.</p>
<p>Changdian is the center of Liulichang Cultural Street. There is a small open space there called Haiyu Village Park. It is said that a Liao Dynasty stone carving was unearthed here in the early Qing Dynasty. At that time, it was known as Haiwang Village, probably a suburb. Opposite Haiwang Village is the kiln factory that burned glazed tiles in the Ming Dynasty, which is now the Normal School, the pre-war Normal University. Yan Song's inscription on the Liulichang Kiln Factory has been moved from a dark corner of the wall to the wall of the water tower, shining brightly in the morning sun. In terms of buying books, the Normal University should be the most fortunate. Less than 500 steps south of the school gate are the dazzling "Changsi" (bookstores): Suyi Zhai, Lai Xun Ge, Tou Chi Jian, where you can browse as you please. But don't dislike the boss for being arrogant. They don't even greet you. You must know that they deal with Hu Shi and Zhao Feiyun. The Beijing Library and Song Gongfu (Peking University Library) are their frequent haunts. They can enter the main hall with a blue cloth wrapper, unlike you, who need a rare book reading certificate to open the door to the real treasures. ——Where do the real treasures come from? You have to thank them for their efforts in collecting them. Although the Wanli edition of the "Jin Ping Mei" was bought from a "noble family" in Shanxi for a few dozen yuan and sold to the Beijing Library for a thousand or so, imagine if there were no these guys, wouldn't you still have to treat the Chongzhen edition as your ancestor? As long as your status is high enough, you can ask to see anything——for example, the Sino-Japanese issue. I guarantee that within a week, even materials you wouldn't have thought of will be on the catalog, placed next to your writing desk. Do you think they would take notice of an unknown university student? So I advise you to be patient. Moreover, you really don't have that much money, because the Normal University has always been known for being "poor."</p>
<p>I love reading Li Nanjian's "Records of Liulichang Bookstores." The article was written in the Daoguang and Xianfeng eras. By the time Miao Xiaoshan wrote the preface in the Guangxu era, he was already lamenting the changes in the world. Now, fifty years later, I don't know how much more has changed. We certainly have more reason to sigh than Miao Xiaoshan, but we can't write such a good article. Here, I want to say that Changdian is not just those deep-seated and knowledgeable old men who are familiar with the monthly book lists. Moreover, on the first day of the Lunar New Year, the area near Haiwang Village becomes a temporary market. The ancient people called it "hundred plays are displayed," which is about the same. In the past, it was only on the first day of the Lunar New Year. After the revolution, it was moved to the Gregorian New Year. However, the Lunar New Year is still inevitable and is resurrected under the name of the Spring Festival. When it was first changed to the Gregorian New Year, the vendors opposed it. After several forced attempts, they reluctantly participated. The Lunar New Year was not allowed to be set up again, but it was finally broken through by human relations. From then on, it was like our New Year, with the old and new running in parallel. Changdian then extended from before the Lunar New Year to the twentieth day of the first month of the Lunar New Year.</p>

<p>Although General Dwight D. Eisenhower achieved great military feats, he was a peace-loving person. He firmly believed that education was the best weapon against war. In a speech at a graduation ceremony, he said: "Your profession should aim to make us unemployed."</p>
<p>In a physics class at West Point Military Academy, a physics teacher was lecturing on atomic theory. He wrote an equation on the blackboard, saying that this equation was related to the problem of several electron changes. Then he filled the entire blackboard with equations. Finally, he said, "You see, there are five fewer electrons than at the beginning. Where have these five electrons gone?"</p>
<p>No one in the classroom made a sound. The teacher asked loudly again, "Everyone, where have these five electrons gone?" The situation seemed serious. At this time, a student in the back row loudly ordered, "No one is allowed to leave this classroom. We have to search it!"</p>
<p>One day, a famous lawyer was sitting in his office when a woman rushed in and immediately declared that she wanted to divorce her husband.</p>
<p>The lawyer asked, "On what grounds?"</p>
<p>She replied that she believed her husband was unfaithful to her.</p>
<p>"On what evidence do you believe your husband is unfaithful to you?"</p>
<p>The woman replied, "Because I firmly believe that he is not the father of my child."</p>
<p>Queen Wilhelmina of the Netherlands visited the United States and West Point Military Academy. The school authorities had arranged the welcoming program very carefully beforehand, but they forgot one thing: they had not planned what music the military band should play. So when the Queen arrived, the band conductor ordered to play his favorite song, which was called: "This gray old mare, she is no longer as before."</p>
<p>Once, a charity ball was held, and George Bernard Shaw attended. During the ball, he invited an old maid to dance.</p>
<p>While dancing, the old maid asked Shaw, "Why did you choose me to dance with you?"</p>
<p>Shaw replied, "Isn't this a charity ball?"</p>
<p>A beggar grabbed the sleeve of a kind-faced passerby and pleaded, "Please give me five minutes to have a cup of coffee, sir!"</p>
<p>The passerby turned around and looked him up and down, asking, "Why should I give you money? How did you come to this?"</p>
<p>The beggar replied, "Because of a very unfortunate disaster, sir. Two years ago, I was like you, a very respectable businessman. On my desk was a motto: 'Thinking must be precise, and doing must be decisive!' Business was booming, but then... then..." The beggar's body trembled, "...then the woman who cleaned the room burned my motto."</p>
<p>Two writers rented a house from a landlord for a term of one year. The landlord promised to repaint the house for them.</p>
<p>Later, the two writers saw that the landlord had no intention of fulfilling his promise, so they asked a lawyer to make another contract with the landlord, allowing them to pay for the house to be painted themselves. The landlord naturally signed it happily.</p>
<p>Two days before moving out, they painted the entire house black.</p>

<p>The current British taxes are very heavy, so tax evasion is inevitable. The following short story was published in London's "Evening Standard."</p>
<p>A wealthy businessman went to the hospital for surgery. Afterwards, the surgeon presented a bill for $1,680 (four hundred something guineas, each guinea equals twenty-one shillings).</p>
<p>"I'm not trying to deny it," the patient told the doctor, "because I can afford this bill. But, you know, under the current differential tax, I have to earn at least $64,000 to pay your $1,680 bill?"</p>
<p>The doctor admitted this. The patient continued, "You are a first-class doctor. You must also be paying heavy taxes. How much do you estimate you can actually get out of the $1,680?"</p>
<p>The doctor calculated roughly for a moment and announced, "About a hundred and eight dollars."</p>
<p>"So," the patient said, "in order to pay you one hundred and eight dollars, I have to earn sixty-four thousand dollars. How about we settle this bill with a case of whiskey?"</p>
<p>"Deal," the doctor said.</p>

<p>— Xuan Xuan</p>
<p>In recent years, in addition to having great respect for compatriots who are fully equipped with American equipment, the author has also been paying attention to the criticisms of American culture by qualified people. However, limited by time and economics, even a superficial understanding is impossible. As far as memory serves, the notable ones are the views of Soviet reportage writer Ilya Ehrenburg, the views of Chen Hengzhe, who represents Chinese intellectuals, and the views of American journalist John Gunther. Although the latter feels magnificent, it is not as subtle as the former two. But regardless, they all have valuable insights and don't simply equate understanding America with knowing which brand of American rayon is the best.</p>
<p>Recently, I also saw the views of a Colombian named Lozano, who served as the Minister of Foreign Affairs of Colombia. After returning from a long trip to the United States, he published his impressions of American culture in a newspaper, which is quite thought-provoking.</p>
<p>The following is Lozano's view:</p>
<p>"Americans are the Romans of today. Material greatness, technological perfection, combined with million-dollar dowagers and beautiful women, are enough to make people ignore their young and simple souls.</p>
<p>"American university education is mediocre because, first, it pays too much attention to sports, and second, the value of academic subjects is not properly distinguished. American law schools that specialize in practical skills only produce lawyers, not jurists. (Note: Hu Shi once criticized Japanese culture, saying that Japan only has professors, not scholars.) Medical schools only focus on laboratories and X-rays, and do not have the European type of clinical research methods.</p>
<p>"After Franklin, when Americans were expanding westward, American culture was declining, except for Walt Whitman and Edgar Allan Poe. (Note: Frank Harris also lamented that the energetic Americans mistreated the geniuses of Whitman and Poe.) Now America is trying to create culture again. American glory, architecture, and books lack the elegance of old cultures, but this is only because Americans are not yet mature, and we cannot demand intellectual penetration. We are older than North Americans, much older... but culture follows wealth... Today's America does not have Goethe, Shakespeare, Kant, or Dostoevsky, but there are millions of people working hard to achieve it."</p>
<p>Although the above words are only partial, the author believes that they are worth pondering. Although Americans are mediocre and superficial, America has vitality, and vitality leads to creation. American flashy newspapers and books certainly cannot represent profound civilization, but having a four-thousand-year history and today's bookstores only printing the "Siku Quanshu Beiyao" for decoration and the "Writing Letters Without Asking Others" for practical use does not count as preserving national essence. Moreover, if this continues, not only will the national essence not be fully preserved, but probably only some national dross will be left.</p>
<p>Lozano is right; culture follows wealth. If a country is poor and the people are poor, there will be no culture. Even if there is historical culture, it is only for wealthy foreign archaeologists to excavate. They can't even take care of themselves. In times of widespread poverty, hearing Lozano's words is especially alarming.</p>

<p>— Chen Zhenyan</p>
<p>Chapter Six A Night Such as This (33)</p>
<p>Zhu Zhai was about to thank her when he heard Qi Huan say, "Do you know what this is?" Zhu Zhai said, "Pearl." Qi Huan said, "No, it's 'Change Pearl.' 'Change Pearl' is my nickname. You must remember it." As she spoke, she tilted her head slightly, tossed her beautiful hair back, and smiled with autumn waves in her eyes, extremely charming. In this situation, Zhu Zhai couldn't help but tightly grasp her hand and say, "Thank you. You gave me something precious that you wear close to your body. What can I give you in return? I can only offer you my sincere heart." Qi Huan tightened Zhu Zhai's tightly grasped hand and said, "That's what I've been longing for. I'm so grateful to you! From today onwards, my soul has gained a kind of comfort." She slightly tilted her head to the left and leaned it on Zhu Zhai's shoulder, saying softly, "Zhu, in a few hours, we will be parting. Do you have anything else to tell me?" Zhu Zhai said, "I only hope that you go early and come back early, so that we can meet again soon!" These words didn't seem to be what Qi Huan was hoping for. She shook her head several times while leaning on Zhu Zhai's shoulder and said, "I'm afraid I won't be able to come back in a short period of time, because after the performance in Jinan, the Qingdao Guanglu Theater will definitely invite me. Since I'm coming to Jinan, I can't help but go to Qingdao. In this case, how can I come back in a short period of time? I hope you can send me a letter every two or three days, telling me in detail about the situation here. Can you promise me?" Zhu Zhai said, "Of course I can do that. Besides, there's another important matter that I need you to promise." Qi Huan immediately turned her head, glanced at Zhu Zhai, and listened attentively with a smile. Zhu Zhai said, "I ask you, you——you——don't drink as much as you did today. Alcohol can hurt people. You have to take care of your voice!" Qi Huan frowned and said, "I don't like to drink! Sometimes I feel sad, so I have no choice but to drink, to use the contents of the cup to numb my brain. Now that my heart has found comfort, I won't drink anymore!" After saying that, she pulled Zhu Zhai up and together they went to her bedroom, sitting side by side on the edge of the bed, repeating, "Zhu! In a few hours, I'll be leaving. Do you have anything else to tell me? I have many things to tell you, but I don't know where to start!" Zhu Zhai said, "Isn't that how I feel! In short, we met very late!" Qi Huan said, "No! I don't think it's too late." Zhu Zhai felt that this sentence fully expressed Qi Huan's intention, giving him a special opportunity, but he didn't have the courage himself. Thinking about it, he gradually lowered his head. Qi Huan saw that he didn't answer, looked at him, and also restrained her smile. Just then, the door moved, and Little Wang Ma walked in holding a pair of lacquer tea trays. On the trays were two teacups, a plate of peeled pears, and a plate of olives. She placed the tea and fruit from the tea trays on the tea table and said with a smile, "The boss drank a lot of wine today. I made two cups of Pu'er tea and two plates of fruit to help sober up." Qi Huan said, "I was just thinking of buying some fruit, but you've already prepared it." Zhu Zhai smiled and said to Little Wang Ma, "Like master, like servant." Little Wang Ma said, "Mr. Xu! You're joking. What master! What servant! I don't understand at all." As she spoke, she went out with a laugh.</p>

<h3 id="e118">Overview of the "Social Service" Business of the Central Daily News in the Past Year <a href="#e118" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c118" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">118</a></h3>
<p>— Ji Ping</p>
<p>Now is the beginning of the year 37 of the Republic of China. The earth is returning to spring, and everything is renewed. Everyone feels excited and happy! However, at this New Year, we must review the past, encourage the future, discard all the previous corruption, and gradually unfold all the good things from now on. If everyone can have such a view, society will have the hope of progress. This column has a responsibility to speak out and discuss the "social service" aspect in general terms with readers. This newspaper has always attached great importance to "social service." Usually, all work is not just empty talk on paper, but doing practical things, serving readers, and serving society. In the past year, we have done several meaningful works. Due to limited space, we can only express them in statistical figures as follows:</p>
<p>Free treatment for trachoma, with a total of 617 people treated free of charge throughout the year, in cooperation with the Nanshi Relief Hospital. From early May to the end of June, a total of 9,573 people were examined over two months, in cooperation with eleven major hospitals, including Zhongshan, Zhongmei, Renji, Gongji, Hongren, Guangci, Hongqiao, Nanyang, Municipal Second, Municipal Fourth, and the Tuberculosis Center Clinic. Furthermore, in cooperation with the Anti-Tuberculosis Clinic, 115 people received free or half-price X-rays. Free assisted childbirth, from February to December, a total of 238 poor pregnant women were hospitalized for childbirth, and both mothers and children were safe and sound, in cooperation with four hospitals, including Renhe, Shangxian, Baoli, and the First Hospital of the Red Cross (the Hui Sheng Obstetrics and Gynecology Hospital also joined the cooperation today). A total of more than 32 million yuan was paid. Free dental treatment, from August to December, 252 people applied for treatment, in cooperation with the Affiliated Hospital of Shanghai Dental College. Scholarships: This year, 354 poor college and middle school students were subsidized, with a total of more than 320 million yuan in full subsidies. Relief for the lonely, widowed, poor, and sick: Over the past year, a total of 112 people were approved to receive relief funds, and more than 100 people were given temporary relief funds. A total of more than 20 million yuan in relief funds were distributed. Job introduction: The news of the Shanghai Job Introduction Office of the Ministry of Social Affairs and the China Vocational Guidance Institute's recruitment of talents is often published, so that people can get their jobs and things can get their people, and the number is considerable.

<h3 id="e119">Exemption from "Inheritance Tax" <a href="#e119" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c119" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">119</a></h3>
<p>Two readers of this newspaper, Zhao Gongxiong and Zhou Shuzhi, have repeatedly inquired about which items can be exempted from inheritance tax. The Shanghai Direct Taxation Bureau's response is as follows: "According to Article 4 of the Inheritance Tax Law, the following types of inheritance can be exempted from inheritance tax: 1. Estates with a total value of less than one million yuan; 2. Estates of officers, soldiers, and civil servants of the army, navy, and air force who die in battle or are injured in wartime service, not exceeding five million yuan; 3. Books and articles related to culture, history, and fine arts in the estate, if the heirs declare preservation and registration to the inheritance tax authorities, but the tax must still be paid if the heirs transfer these books and articles; 4. Property donated to government agencies at all levels; 5. Property donated to schools, hospitals, and libraries, not exceeding two million yuan; 6. The copyright of the deceased and the patent rights for academic inventions or self-created works of art. If there is an estate distributed in the occupied areas of the Communist bandits, the levy will be temporarily suspended during the occupation period."</p>
