<h3>九龍城事件的惡化　—普天論我們所應抱的態度</h3>
<p>九龍城事件突趨惡化，演出流血慘劇，中國人民無不羣情激昂，京滬等地學生聞又將罷課，遊行示威。對於此一事件之有這樣的發展，我們深爲遺憾。現在事態旣續在演變中，我們首先要指出的就是，無論此一事件如何演變，我們應以理智克服情感。就過去數日中的發展，我們看見在我國政府的一方面，先有王外長於十二日電召英大使施蒂文至外部，嚴厲要求倫敦政府立卽訓令香港總督，在此交涉期間，對九龍城中止一切强制行動，並不再派遣警察進入該城；又於八日向英國大使提出書面抗議。迨香港政府績派武裝警察進入九龍城並發生傷害中國人民情事後，廣東省務會議隨卽通過決議，撥五億元救濟九龍城受難居民，復派省委蕭次尹帶款赴九龍城慰問。在香港政府方面，旣派武裝警察入城强制拆毀民屋，又曾開槍演成流血事件，而其法庭復曾判決九龍城抗命不遷之居民以徒刑，否認該庭無管轄九龍城之權。在九龍城居民方面，則民情激昂，爲維護我國的主權，「誓死不去」。</p>
<p>關於九龍事件，我們前曾著論，以爲九龍城本身爲香港政府權力所不能到達之地，卽使爲了治安關係，也應該首先安定民生。斷不能有拆屋迫遷情事的發生。因此，希望英政府和香港當局，能認識中英間的遠大關係，勿作刺激中國感情的行動。如今此一事件却愈益惡化，我們實在爲之扼腕。我們於此要指出的是：此一事件之所以趨於惡化，未必卽是英國政府政策的反映。事件之所以如此發展，主要係由於香港政府之視爲一宗地方事件，在處理方面，又不免操之過急。在香港政府內，原多殖民地的省員，他們對於被統治人民情緒旣漠不關心，卽對於倫敦政府的政策，也不免很有隔膜。本來，九龍城爲　爾之地，我們中國人民原不欲以此些微事件，在如今激數的國際局勢下，看得過分嚴重，期使此一事件能够消滅於無形。如今事態旣已發展到現階段，我外部已向英大使提出抗議，深望倫敦政府對於香港政府官員的暴行，能迅爲有效的制北，一面對於香港政府下的負責人員能爲必要的懲處，使此一事態能够就此弭平下來。我們深信艾德里首相所領導的政府，旣能遂行英國的退出印度，又能予緬甸以獨立，亦能具有遠大的眼光，對於此一九龍事件爲迅速必要的措施。須知莫斯科方面現正發動對英之宣傳攻勢，此一九龍城事件正好爲之增加口實。艾德里首相高瞻遠矚，我們相信是決不欲以此些小事件而影饗到大局的。</p>
<p>我們於此更要指出的是九龍城這一問題，實與整個港九問題相關；卽捨香港問題而不談，亦與整個九龍租借地問題相關連，從中英邦交及整個世界局勢而論，英國旣撤離印度，又許緬甸以獨立，實應自動將港九交遝給中國。英國留此港九，在目前的戰爭形勢下，對於它旣不具有戰略的意義，反或增加它的担負。它所能給予英國的怕就只能安挿若干數目極小的殖民地官員和一些冒險家；爲了此等人而使中英兩國的睦誼蒙上了一層陰影，其爲不智，何待多言。當年邱吉爾任英國戰時首相的時候，曾言他不欲主持大英帝國的結束淸算；這是在這種形勢下，我們有中英新約的簽訂，其間並沒有觸及港九問題。目今的形勢與邱言爾主政時顯有懸殊，我們顧艾德里政府能本其一貫的開明政策，難印度緬旬之後，對此港九問題能作正本淸源的澈底解決。倘能因此次九龍城事件而使整個港九問題作一總解決，則九隊城居民此暨所流的血，纔有其更寶貴的意義。</p>
<p>復次，由於此次九龍城事件而使中國人民自發的激昂情緒，象徵中國民族生命力的充沛，實在是很可喜的。但我們於此要指出的是：此一事件，在我政府方面，旣有粵省府的撥款救濟，派員慰問；而我外交當局又正與英國進行交涉中，我們人民應一致以信任來做政府的後盾，避免事態的擴大。至於各地學生，激於義憤，或擬有所行動，原爲愛國情緒的崇高表現，値得一般的讚佩。但罷課遊行，初未必對於事件的解決能有什麽幫助，而荒廢學業，影響成績，尤爲直接有關之損失；矧莫斯科正擬發動對英之宣傳攻勢，國家値動員戰亂之會，離免不有遠反民族利益之人，從中掀風作浪。凡我國民，均應克制情感，回復理智，不使政府增加困難；則此一九龍城事件或能迅速圓滿解決。</p>
<p>末了，我們更深有感觸而不能已於言者：就是九龍城事件之所由起，也多由於勝利後共匪的蓄意謀亂。假使我們在勝利後沒有共匪的作亂，我們也許可以早已收回港九了。因爲有共匪的作亂，我們不得不動員戡亂；在此情形之下，我們進行收回港九的交涉，旣未能順利展開，而香港的殖民地官員乃能變本加厲的幹出這些暴行。共匪更又援引外力，就是我們東北的大部分，如今還是在外力的統治之下。這樣演變下去，假使共匪不除，亡國之痛，不難想像。今當九龍城事件再惡化之會，我們願中國人民更能認識共匪禍國的毒辣，一致起而積極參加戡亂：等到匪禍弭平之日，中國人民纔能回復它健康的發展。到了那個時候，決不會再有像目前九龍城這種事件的發生了。</p>

<p>〔本報漢口十四日電〕鄂中美籍敎士被匪徒槍殺消息傳出後，此間美籍人士頗爲震驚，記者今晨分訪美敎會負責人韓森牧師及美駐漢領事貝肯，韓收師以沉重語氣向記者表示，此事發生，吾人不便發表任何意見，但可言渚，一般匪徒意在搶刧財物，旣不輕易傷人，尤不致單獨殺害美籍人士，故吾人判斷此一完全反常之暴行，殆必爲共匪所扮演。又據貝克領事談：截至目前止，尙未接獲關於此一事件之直接詳細報告，故不願加以肯定評論，但慘劇確已發生，現正辦理善後，教會方面已通知接近匪區之敎士，儘速向鄭州，老河口及其也安全地帶撤退，再以專機接至漢口集中，現敎會所有聖保羅第七十二號飛機，巳於今晨首次飛鄭州迎接敎士，並有美聯社記者米海樓隨機前往，預定今日來回二次，可接敎士六十人以上，其自鄂境撤退敎土，因老河口無民用機塲，現正輾轉請求中國空軍當局准予臨時偕用，一俟核准，日內即可飛往迎接，至被害敎士三人遺骸，已由敎愈派員運送來漢，日內即可到達，並將安葬漢口。最後，貝氏表示，如有交通工具，領事署準備前往荆門實地調査，以期獲得直接情報。</p>

<h3>劉瑤章談話</h3>
<p>據劉議長瑤章吿記者：就糧荒而言，華北糧食戰前本不能自給，全仰頓河南·東北·西北各省之接濟，今因時局關係，能供給華北食糧者唯有長江流域，但因運輸不能按時，而河北軍糧需求孔急，事實上仍有就地征借者，兼以匪軍擾亂，難民日增，紛紛入城避亂，更加深城市之糧荒，目前北平之麵粉價格，已高至一百十萬元一小袋（約三十七斤），糧價彼動，北方人心亦隨之而浮動，希望當局今後能取消糧食北運之種種限制，並以外國洋麵接濟，或以北方之煤易取南方之米，美救濟物資分配時，亦望能多顧到北方之需要。關於恢復工貸，對於北方尤爲迫切，因北方工業範圍小，故支持力亦小，目前北方工業已有因受工貸停發而减產者，再經年賞之壓迫，陰曆年關渡過不易，此事如不能善爲處理，將由經濟問題轉為失業問題，再轉變爲治安及政治問題，故不得不請求政府急速恢復工貸，至於監督辦法，自可詳加硏討。以上兩項，均爲目前之緊急問題，至於根本之圖，約有三點：　獎勵北方之進出口業。　華北工廠凡已開工者應求其維持，未開工者應盡力設法助其開工，據本人粗疏佔計，華北接收敵僞工廠，已復工者殆不足十分之二。　華北之糧食應盡力增產，日人過去開墾之八十萬畝田地，目前農林部續加經營者，不過四分之一，幾林部之五年增產計劃中，頭兩年河北均不在內，實所不解，希望能加以修正。關於華北大局，劉氏表示首先希望楚溪莽主席能早日來平就職，在今日北方局面，省府不能一日無主，華北剿匪總部成立後，可收指揮統一兵力運用靈活之效，如能配合地方民衆武力之建立，北方大局尙可樂觀。</p>

<h3>各戰塲國軍均掌握主動　鄧文儀報吿一週戰局</h3>
<p>〔本報南京十四日電〕國防部新聞局局長鄧文儀，十四日在記者招待會席上報吿卅七年一月八日至十四日之一週戰局稱：</p>
<p>這一週來，東北匪軍想偷製瀋陽，又吃了一次敗戰，起初匪以優勢兵力集結於　西北公主屯以東及法庫間地區，企圖打擊國軍後，再威脅瀋陽，雖國軍一師被裝曾受損失，但由於國軍分路進剿，給匪一個反包圍，自八日在遼河兩岸及法庫附近即擊破林匪之一·二·四·六·十等五個縱隊，把匪第四縱隊的第卅五·卅四·卅六·三個團全部殲滅，匪不支狼狽向西向北潰竄，瀋西局勢，已吿穩定。</p>
<p>在華北方面，自平保綫國軍會師後，九日又在姚村附近擊潰匪三·六兩個縱隊之竄擾，打破匪五個團以上之兵力，俘匪五千多人，十日國軍某部又在定興南殲滅匪三縱隊十一旅之三十三團全部，自此國軍向保定外圍滿城一帶掃蕩，保定守軍亦奮勇出擊，十一日在滿城東南把聶匪二·四·六縱隊約六個團打得潰不成軍，紛向滿城西南山地逃竄，有化整爲零趨勢，平保戰事目前已入淸剿階段。</p>
<p>當匪在平漢綫上被迫剿之際，匪渤海軍區和匪海防大隊集聚四千餘匪衆，爲减輕冀四匪軍所受的壓力，乃發動對津東小站一帶的牽制戰，以圖威脅塘沽，但該方面國軍僅配合地方團隊一部向該匪掃蕩，十一日晨就克復小站，該方面局勢，仍恢復安定。</p>
<p>豫鄂皖方面的劉伯承匪部，因被國軍四面壓迫，不得不分股流竄，時而向東，時而向西，旣不能躱避國軍的圍剿，又不時遭受到地方團隊的伏擊，飢寒交迫，傷亡慘重，其第一縱隊一般竄臨汝集，主力則在包信集，二縱隊已過宣化店西竄，三縱隊在施家橋，岳西，黃牛山一帶流竄，六縱隊主力仍在禮山附近閃避圍剿，十縱隊殘部在新野附近，會合陳賡匪部，意圖圍攻鄧縣的民團，我內鄉的民團已前往增援，預計不久，匪必仍走逃亡一途，其盤據於大洪山附近六十二縱隊，一股竄至隨縣附近，另一股千餘竄至鐘祥以北，渡襄河向胡家集流竄，國軍正分路追剿。</p>
<p>蘇魯豫方面之陳毅匪八·十·十一·三個縱隊自菏澤一戰不得逞後，刻分竄於隴海南之睢縣宁陵及柳河各地區，其一·三·四·六各縱隊，正紛向東北竄至太康一帶，企圖與北面之匪合流，目前無大戰鬥。</p>
<p>晋南方面，自太原南下兵　，先後收復霍縣，趙城，洪洞，會師臨汾後，北上的國軍勁旅自九日又開始由東西南三面向運城前進，十日克復解縣，乘勝北進，所向披靡，十二日午後就克復運城，守城匪軍兩個旅已完全擊潰，城外漏網之匪，紛紛逃命北竄，匪徒們以六借兵力攻佔運城，不到一月，仍歸夢想，還犧牲一萬以上的兵力。緊接着新年以後的勝利，必還繼續不斷的會來到，這已證明中國人民的奮起和國軍的進攻，已掌握着戰塲的主動。</p>

<h3>五齡女孩作賊　三代相傳身手敏捷　竊巨案在京破獲　主犯母女遠遁香島</h3>
<p>〔本報南京十四日電〕上年十一月二十七日滬國泰越劇院看客顧項氏（住上海興安路麥賽坊十二號）之七克拉鑽戒被竊案，已於十三日在京破獲。該案在滬發生後，即有嫌疑犯四十餘人被捕，旋悉係徐娣領導之偸竊帮所爲。惟是時徐帮已分散潛逃。其中大桂英等經蘇錫輾轉來京。滬　局曾派多人來京，與首都北區警察局聯絡偵訪。十三日午，北區警局限綫在自山西路南駛公共汽車內，發現一形跡可疑之婦女一人。緊跟至新街口下軍後，不久即於其再度行竊之際，加以逮捕果究出滬竊鐵案眞象。據供：該案行竊者爲徐娣之五歲女孩毛毛。先是顧項氏指上大　戒惹眼，彼等於顧氏某處宴畢，即開始跟踪。迨至國泰越劇院，徐娣抱毛毛坐於顧氏旁側代友人所留之空座上，並謂如有人來，當還坐後排位置。是時徐娣母女與顧氏問尙有一空位。移時徐氏稱累，乃使毛毛坐於空位上，與顧氏相鄰。未久毛毛即將　氏自指上褪下放入皮包中之大鑽戒竊去。毛毛祖父兩代，均爲慣竊，復得乃母傳授，手法輕巧，顧氏竟朱覺察。毛毛於鑽石到手後數分鐘，即鬧稱便急。徐娣故意吿知厠所方向，囑毛毛自往。毛毛去後良久未返，徐娣乃故作焦急，詭稱尋女而離去。而顧氏直至戲院散塲欲重御戒指時，方始發覺失竊。據大桂英供稱：徐娣為求鑽戒脫手，已携毛毛遁往香港。京北區需局破獲是案後，滬警局各分局均前往提人。北區警局以該案爲新成分局所轄，乃交由新成分局探員於十四日午後快車將大桂英解滬。</p>

<p>而將李族李炳美（即馬　氏之已故前夫）之子，過繝於張鍚安，原冀兩族後此永敦睦誼，不料李炳美於去年突遭共匪慘殺，事後李族中竟指此舉乃張故意挑事後李族中竟指此舉乃張故意挑豫，借刀殺人，因此仇恨之心重起。未幾，由鄕長高德標，副鄕長李學科二人，糾集族人李華等供給槍械，唆使彼等行刧，並　彼等揚言是項槍械係由張之還鄕隊所供給，藉以</p>
<p>嫁禍於張</p>
<p>詎李華不久即失風被捕，供出前情。常時張爲表示淸白起見，即將經過當衆宣佈，而高，李二人至此遂不得不離鄉避居南京，復以生活所迫，在京以拉人力車度日，惟二人殺張之心已萌，故李等在京，暗中即探訪與張族有宿仇之同鄉，以便聯合對付。未幾有名李秉珍者，謂渠有胞兄弟二人，亦係被張所殺，願參加</p>
<p>共同陣綫</p>
<p>是時李學軒因體力關係，即離京來滬，住於共和新路炒米浜七十五號張運城處，至上月九日張錫安販蓮鯉魚六担，粉皮數十斤來滬出售，當日住宿於張連城對房其姪張萬春家中，李見機會難逢，即運夜去信通知南京，李秉珍，囑速來滬復仇，李接函後邀一同族人李重善，於十三日趕抵上海，先赴虹鎭馬齊氏家密談，並鼓勵馬氏</p>

<h3>疏通水運暢導糧源　蘇州河進出船隻採取單程交通制</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕吳市長前因蘇州河狹窄，往來船隻衆多，於寒冬水落期問，每易阻塞，影響甚鉅，特手論社警兩局加以疏通，以暢糧源。昨午十二時，社會局糧食科長吉明　，水上警察分局長吳克孝，市府專門委員黃家駒及米商查寶山等四人，特往北新涇，諸翟，黃渡一帶寶地勘察阻塞情形。見有一千餘船隻爭相進出，擁擠不堪，乃決定蘇州河水運採取單程交通制。潮進口時祇准船隻內駛，潮落時祇准外出，平潮時則爲準備時期。如此有秩序進出，可减少阻塞擁擠情形，一行於下午四時始返滬。</p>
<h3>「上海小姐」內心痛苦吃勿消他「愛」的方式　更爲了張姓舞女　兩情脈脈隔鴻溝</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕「上海小姐」謝家驊已由港返滬。渠係去年七一月二日由滬飛港，爲大中華影片公司拍片。聞拍片合同，在其婚前即已簽妥，後囚謝與榮梅莘相識未滿兩月，即吿結合，因此未及向榮提及此事，不料結　後，榮對謝約束　嚴，家庭間時生齟　，且止謝之拍片計劃，　因愛好電影心切，遂毅然不別而行，雙身去港，甫卸行裝，十二月三日榮即跟蹤到　，托友　謝至淺水灣飯店，責令謝即日同返上海，謝以須先償付影片公司合同上之損失爲辭，榮則要求其先行回滬，爭持不下間，榮忽突前將謝掀倒，緊扼其喉，並謂：「我愛你！我愛煞你！」謝觀此宛如恐佈電影中之塲面，駭極狂呼，斯時適大中華派員來接謝赴廠拍戲，欲代爲報警，經謝力阻始罷。</p>
<p>消息轉來上海，謝母惶急萬狀，立於五日趕赴香港，擬與榮理論，榮見成僵局，爲免異鄕受　，未與謝母謀面，同日即飛返上海。大中華邀謝主演之「上海小姐」一片，至此乃整個改編，即以淺水　事件爲根據，　定片名爲「滿城風雨」，仍由謝現身說法，至十二月底拍攝竣事。</p>
<p>謝目嫁榮後，謝絕交際，渠言在港期問，除拍片外，亦絕足不事宴遊，以冀博榮歡心，互矢永好。惟榮　一張姓舞女，並別貸新屋　嬌，　受此精神刺激，遂有走港之舉。當時外間曾盛傳　係捲逃，但據謝稱：「以我現在身世及上海小姐之頭銜，根本無須再求虛名　利，去港拍片，一方面固因愛好電影藝術，實亦由於精神苦悶過而出此。我　　能不吿而別　身離滬，亦可反證榮先生並非每日在家住宿，否則一切當然可以和他商量。」</p>
<p>日前謝由港返滬，榮與謝之堂兄謝子英俱在機塲迎接，榮求謝與其同行不果，對謝子英稱：「她是我的太太！」謝子英則稱：「她是我的妹妹！」榮繼又謂：「我愛她！」謝謂：「你又要愛煞她？」結果不歡而散。</p>
<p>據謝稱：榮似對渠仍表愛戀，渠亦在在顧全榮之顏面。惟榮所戀之舞女悍暴逾恒，榮頗憚其　威，因此雖兩情脈脈，中間仍不免隔一鴻溝。榮表示無論如何，決不願與謝仳離，而謝則挽　昔　律師向榮提出：除保證今後不再對謝施以任何虐待外，渠與張姓舞女脫幅之日，即謝　返夫家之時。但張姓舞女現正懐孕待產，似仍須相當時日。</p>
<p>謝自返滬後，僅在機塲與榮一値。此後即未落面。渠現已移居親戚家中，因對電影彌感興趣，故仍有意再主演一部影片，聞本市已有影片公司向渠接洽中。</p>

<h3>長沙一慘劇　哥哥砍傷老父　弟弟鋤斃哥哥</h3>
<p>〔本報長沙九日航訊〕我國是一個講伶理的社會，君臣，父子兄弟，夫妻，朋友，是向來大家所尊奉的「五倫」。這種倫理觀念，是維持社會道德的一種良方，數十年來我國的社會秩序，雖不能說完全賴此種倫理觀念來維持，但其成分必佔有很大重量，是無可否認的。社會上目前盛行一種功利主義。我國的老牌倫理觀念，漸趨沒落之途，然以根深蒂固，此種數千年來的倫理觀念，還是殘留在大多數人民的頭腦裏。在此蛻變的時代裏長沙竟出現了「倫理與法律」爭鬥的一個新聞，引起了多數人的注意。事情是這樣的：</p>
<p>長沙鄉間</p>
<p>官第七保周家壩一個穿藍布長衫姓周的紳土，鄉人喊他「周家三爹」，家道小康，沒有什麼職業，全靠遺產過活。抗戰以來，物價高漲，生活漸漸負担不起，成了一個沒落的家庭。他有兩個兒子，長子周壽林，讀書未成，遊手好閑，成日嗜賭爲生，在周家壩，他有個綽號叫「半癩子」，因爲不務正業，替他討了妻室後，即分居一邊，所分得的產業是十二畝田，幾間土屋。壽林</p>
<p>分家獨立</p>
<p>後，行為更形放蕩，不數年，把十二畝祖產全部輸光了，近來家中妻兒子女均陷在饑察交迫中，他個人則三天長沙，四天銅官，（銅官距長沙市三十華里），境遇由此更弄得不成話了。</p>
<p>次子周壽剛，他出世時家境已沒有從前的風光，接着抗戰八年，他在此困苦的一段時期中，由小小小學而中學，到了抗戰末期，也就是民國二十三年春，家里最後一批田產給他哥哥賭賣後，終於無法繼續他的學業，而投入了靑年軍。這幾年來，哥哥沉緬在酒賭中，弟弟掮了槍投入大時代漢流中煎熬。兩個人向兩個極端不同的方面發展着。</p>
<p>十二月間長沙降了大　，窮人們受不了飢寒交迫的苦難，老弱轉於溝堅，强者則走上犯法道路。周壽林雖然沒有淪爲盜匪，却做下了</p>
<p>逆倫大罪</p>
<p>來了。一天早晨，周壽林　着心，拿了一把菜刀，走到父親的住處，威脅父親拿出養老的田契給他出賣。父親自然不肯，壽林　父親不防，把菜刀砍去，三爹年邁力衰，自然無力抵抗，刀尖砍中了額角，鮮血直流，暈倒在地。壽林把父親殺傷後，從容　進房里搜取田契。偏偏寃家路窄，壽林的弟弟壽剛從靑年軍請假回家不久，他從外面回來，一見老父躺在血泊裏不明究竟，急急跑進房內，一看他的哥哥正在搜取田契，知道殺父兇手原來是哥哥，一時怒不可遏，迎面就給哥哥兩個耳光。壽林此時，一不做，二不休，反身拿了</p>
<p>一把鋤頭</p>
<p>對壽剛一鋤打來。壽剛限快，閃過一邊，順手撈得一條板凳，用凳脚鈎住壽林的頸項，用力一拉。壽林仆倒，乘隙奪過壽林手裏的鋤頭，舉手一鋤，這位殺父的哥哥，竟慘死在弟弟的鋤下了。</p>
<p>壽剛殺死哥哥後，他並沒有逃跑，把父觀救起，並科理喪事。一切停妥了，然後向家族問分別報吿，「哥哥殺父，我殺哥哥，與別人無干，我決不連累他人」。鄉黨鄰里，對壽剛的殺兄是表示同情的，可是國法上不允許壽剛有此舉動，殺人償命，壽剛終於十二月二十一日的晚上被鄕公所捕去。現在，官廳方面要辦壽剛的罪，而周家祠堂的人却不肯辦，為壽剛申援。將來此案究竟如何發落，尙待下回分解。（本報特派員黃潮如）</p>

<h3>無錫倉庫主任刦帳册　派員提取軍米被扣押</h3>
<p>〔本報宜興十二日訊〕本邑東門外協成機　碾米廠，係由吳萬邦等集資開設，營業不惡，去年因代政府加工軍糧，以內部管理欠週，形成紊亂狀態。該廠司賬葉長根曾因一度欠解軍糧被押，但以出入賬目與經手解送軍糧者，未能取得連繁，深苦一時無法淸算，爲應付淸繳軍糧起見，祇得將各戶存稻行墊解，同時宣吿停業。該經理吳萬邦秉性懦弱，無法善後，大有進退維谷情勢，茲誌詳情於後：</p>
<p>解糧超額</p>
<p>該廠所加工之軍米，一向派員運解無錫倉庫，最近發現歷次解出之加工米單據，發覺不符，出入頗多，乃於本月三日派職員江金榮，王炳生兩人赴錫結算。無如該倉庫主任張稱倫，初則多方留難，繼而聲稱尙少軍糧四百大包，一味推諉，不予結算，而協成廠應解軍糧一千一百包，實解一千一百二十六包，相抵爭存廿六包，均有賬單爲憑。</p>
<p>搶刦單據</p>
<p>主任張稱倫（已解職），知真相必將被揭發，即暗矚他人出爲調處，着協成廠再交一百包作爲了結。江金榮，王炳生兩人未予接受，即於四日由張稱倫偕同職員蔣延齡，何品高等，關至無錫太平洋飯店二十二號江金榮王炳生兩人所開房間內聲言算賬，江等信以爲眞，即將倉庫所發單據，準備取出，詎知張稱倫，蔣延齡等竟袖出手槍威嚇，勒逼江·王兩人將單據交出罷事。江等未允，張蔣即予以拳脚交加，並以手槍作射擊狀，江等無法抵抗，所有賬册單據等七張盡被搶去</p>
<p>冒提軍米</p>
<p>張稱倫華以江金榮，王炳生兩人所携賬據已被搶回，無有憑證，即向其勒累所欠軍米四百包，否則不予結賬。江等即藉詞需請示廠方決定後，再行結算，江等乃速夜趕回宜興報吿廠方，而張稱倫以江等尙未返宜，爲先發制人計，同日即派蔣延齡及前倉庫配運股長陳炳南兩人，以提取麻袋爲名，乘車來宜，意圖向廠方勒索庫米四百包，以飽私囊。</p>

<p>事為協成廠職員江金榮，王炳生兩人得悉，以蔣延齡，陳炳南兩人均爲前無錫倉庫職員，且蔣延齡係以手槍威脅，搶奪收據之一員，顯有通同曚混盲取軍糧行爲，即於九日晨將蔣陳兩人備文扭送孝侯區署，歐區長徇被吿之請，在蔣陳兩人身畔抄出極爲可疑之函件兩封，弊實躍然紙上。本擬解縣，因蔣陳兩人要求均係省處現職人員，該事純係出諸前倉庫主任張稱倫一人之手，需張稱倫到塲後，始得水落石出。刻下陳炳南則趕赴無錫將張稱倫負賓同至宜興給算，蔣延齡則派員監視，一俟張稱倫到案，眞相當可大白。</p>

<h3>『流注』與『流痰』</h3>
<p>— 朱仁康</p>
<p>流注不足慮，流痰最嚴重</p>
<p>平常人只認爲「流注」是外科中的重症，却並不知道「流痰」比「流注」更嚴重，「流注」和「流痰」，雖然都　外症，病情也很相像，實則大有區別。</p>
<p>「流注」在都市裏的人，患者極少，相反的在鄉村麥的農人一天到晚，動勞不息，受到勞傷，瘀血積住，最容易生「流注」，此病隨處都可發生，初起腫處，皮色不變，並不發紅，漫腫無頭，但發　痛，約經一兩星期，　痛增加，腫脹擴大，寒熟不退，內部已在化膿，有了膿外面仍不易覺察，有經騐的醫師才可診斷得出，宜趕快開刀，膿厚而且多，甚至看數盌之多，洽療得當，在十日至廿日之間，就能收口，滬是輕症。</p>
<p>「流痰」症就不同了，上海一隅患者不在少數，我們接觸到的，平常人誤認爲是流注的，但大半數都是此種「流痰」，都市裏的人，平常嬌生慣養，養尊處優，但是體質都是孱弱，所以都容易患此結核性的外症，且隨處可生，初起息處結塊略腫，却毫不覺痛，就因爲不感痛，所以放任不加醫治，經過一年半戲，才覺着痛，而想着要治療，那就嫌晚了，終至發軟熟而穿潰，流着黃水而夾有腐塊狀之物，不能收口，瘡口凹陷，因其不收口，就誤認是瘻管，却並非瘻管，身體益加衰弱，如兼咳嗽盜汗潮熱等症，就變成痰癆病了，若能早期醫治，並注意保養身體，培補滋養，亦有治愈的希望。</p>
<p>對於上述兩症的辨別點，「流注」起得快，或消散或化膿，所以治愈亦快，「流痰」起時很慢，所以治愈也難呀！</p>
<h3>小兒何以消瘦　與蟲病有關</h3>
<p>— 徐仲才</p>
<p>爲家長者每以小兒消瘦爲莫大隱愛，常千方百計，設法調補，而見效甚微，此何故耶！</p>
<p>要知小兒如無其他病象，祗是面黃肌瘦，精神不振，身體日就衰弱大便溏薄有時便結，此時宜疑及有虫病，虫病有蚘虫，　虫，十二指腸虫，鞭虫等。</p>
<p>蚘虫，幾於無人不知，與蚯蚓相似，生卵於人體陽中，每隨糞便排泄，國人向以糞便爲肥料，每附着蔬菜果物，如未經煮熟，小兒食之則亦有虫症矣。</p>
<p>虫，身體扁平，由多數環節相連而成，長者可及數丈，多爲食未經煮熟之魚類，牛肉，猪肉等傳來，而寄生腸內。</p>
<p>鞭虫，每寄生於盲腸附近，對於人體爲害尙輕。</p>
<p>十二指腸虫，長三五分，有此虫之小兒，每見特殊嗜好，喜吃泥土，紙屑，布塊，炭灰等。</p>
<p>治宜辨別其何種虫症，而施以相當之驅虫藥，此外並宜輔助其消化，補助其營養，藥店所售之機子，八珍糕等，可以常吃。</p>
<h3>中風</h3>
<p>— 程國樹</p>
<p>中風一症，有類中風，眞中風，之別，茲分述於後</p>
<p>『類中風』西醫名之曰腦出血，犯者多年踰四旬，尤以肥胖人佔多數，起源於老年人動脈管硬化，腦中血管發生粟粒狀動脈瘤，且血壓亢進，即腦中流入血液量多而壓力增大，則血管脆裂而出血，突然神昏不語，目定口呆，牙關拘急，痰聲曳鋸，氣粗息高，或半身不遂等現象，如見口開目合，脈細微遺尿者，危在頃刻。多因身體受到劇烈衝動，猝然跌仆，頭部受撞，或精神特別興奮，飲酒太過，食物太飽，長久雀戰，或大便時用力努責，入浴過久，均能引起血壓亢進，而發生類中國症。羚羊爲此症之要藥，能降低血壓，有阻止腦部溢血之功，惟須重用，輕則無效。迨其神淸能言之後，其後遺之半身不遂症，當用養血活血之品，長服久服，以通筋舒絡，緩緩圖其恢復。</p>
<p>『預兆及預防』如有手指感覺麻木，皮膚有如螞蟻行走，言語不淸爽，耳中發響，頭脹昏暈，眼目發紅，精神異常等現象，即宜留意暴發類中風，預防方法，可常服海藻，昆布，藥芹菜，以緩和血管硬化，（佛慈藥廠海藻晶，簡便易服）</p>
<p>『眞中風』爲烈風猝中，昏仆卒死之症，南方絕無此病，姑從略。</p>

<h3>半身不遂</h3>
<p>— 阮新民</p>
<p>半身不遂，是　復通俗的抽象名詞，形容務半邊身體，或左或右，不得動作，醫籍定名曰偏枯，分別出內風與外風兩種，內風即近今常常見到的中風病（參見另篇），外風大都得之於婦人多產血衰，或肥碩多濕，前則「內風」，必兼口眼歪斜，言語蹇澀，後則「外風」是血虛風濕入絡，氣血流行被阻，故逐漸而起，單獨影響到經絡關節，慢慢地手足行動不便，外風與內風病因雖殊，綏急有別，但其後果，皆為經絡及神經不利則相等，患斯症者，除行動已失去自主外，對於內朦腸胃，尙無多大變化，故能飲食如恒，調養適當亦可帶疾延年，當其初期感覺頭眩「血壓高」及酸痛　強之時，施以金針治療，內服平肝潛陽，舒筋活絡之劑，往往能潤死肌而復活，回枯憔以向榮，何半身不遂之足畏，等旣成事實，病根已深，血管神經強硬，失去工作效能，雖有金針妙術，對症良藥，非經過長期治療，不克圖功焉。</p>
<h3>從月經談到生育</h3>
<p>— 沈仲理</p>
<p>女子經血，每月一行，此爲常情，間有例外者，如兩月一行，謂之併月，三月一行，謂之居徑，一年一行，謂之避年、一生不行，謂之暗經，凡此種種，雖與常人異稟不同，皆非病也，且依然有懐孕之能力。</p>
<p>蓋女子生產機能，全在卵巢所排之卵子，如卵巢機能不全，或卵巢萎縮，而不能排卯，雖有月經，也不能生育，是則月經雖按期而來，其有經臨腹痛，腰痠頭暈，帶下不淨，或素體肥胖，阻碍卵子之通過，自不能受孕，古書記載，謂有五種不孕，曰螺，紋，鼓，角，脈者，是即今人子宮異常之謂，原因乃後天性之斷傷，而致子宮及輸卵管之不健全，即使得孕·甚而形成葡萄胎，子宮外妊娠等危險，更有因花柳病，而致終身不能生育者，不勝枚舉。</p>
<p>月經一旦發現病態，則生育必定發生障碍，所以欲求生育，必先調整月經，量體質虛實而用藥，庶克奏效。書有騐方三則，如爲月經不調，不能生育者，服益母勝金丹（熟地，當歸，白芍，川有，丹參，茺蔚，香附，白朮，益母草）。其因宮寒淸弱者（乃子宮轍卵管作用後天性之减退），服種子丸（當歸，蓯蓉，蓮　，杜仲，菟絲，淫羊霍，潼沙苑，雲苓，補骨脂，牛膝，拘杞，桂心，天雄，角鰾）。身體肥胖，脂膜塞抱者（謂卵巢發育不全陰道酸性液分泌過多），用四物湯合　飲六神湯（當歸，川芎，生地，白芍，半夏，橘紅，菖蒲，胆星，旋覆，茯神）。隨症處方，或改爲膏滋汁九劑常服，允稱最合理之種子良方也。</p>

<h3>工業界代表吳蘊初晉京　請求政府恢復貸款　今日出席全國經濟委員會報吿</h3>
<p>〔本報南京十四日電〕關於工商貸款之開放問題，前經四聯總處分函國家家行局徵詢意見，現悉各項有關意見已陸續送到四聯秘書處硏究後，即可於理事會中　出討論。</p>
<p>〔本報南京十四日電〕政院新聞局長電顯光，十四日在能者招待會席問稱，國家行局對於停止貸款辦法，最近期間不擬作變更之考慮。過去已放出之貨款，凡滿期者，仍應繼續催還。至於日後採取何種方式，運用各項資金，以扶助工商業，其辦法正在硏究中，目前尚無任何具體決定。</p>
<p>全國工業協會理事長吳蘊初，爲代表工業界向當局　求恢復貸款，以資調　資金，發展工業，增加生產，特於昨晚乘車晋京。據悉吳氏此次晋京携有工業界對開放貸款之具體意見，將出席今日在京舉行之全國經濟委員會例會報吿。並悉　聯總處亦定於日內召開理事會議，加以硏下。</p>
<p>按自政府停止工業貸款及內地購貨匯款後，工業界以資金不敷週轉，而處境日感困難，紛紛要求救濟。曾由全國工業協會呈請政府迅速有條件開放，政府以過去工貨辦法，未趨妥善，須由工業界本身擬具辦法，以供主管當局硏討，茲悉該會已綜合各方意見，擬具建議五點如下：</p>
<p>一，貸款對象　以民生必須之生產事業，其經濟實在窘迫者為限。</p>
<p>二，貸款用途　以購買必需原料及發放工資之用，不能移作他項用途。</p>
<p>三，申請貸款手續　各廠申請貸款，其是否切實需要，須光經各所屬同業公會作初步之審査，再行請主管機構核定。（因各廠實際情形同業公會知之較詳）</p>
<p>四，貸款用途之稽核：由放款銀行隨時檢查貸款之用途，以防囤積居奇。</p>
<p>五，貸款抵押　以工業產品或生產設備及廠房提供抵押。</p>
<h3>多空雙方角逐　華股由昂轉疲</h3>
<p>華股昨多空爭門激烈，塲外竞高於塲內達三十餘元，小型股雜股每况愈下，銀根又緊，廣帮傾售，終將永紗壓小，前途飄忽。</p>
<p>晨開時因拆除電話之風聲甚緊，未見有利，永紗以則交八二〇元，遞交八一五元登塲，形成倒掛。開後二三五號等脫手，而降至八〇五元及八〇七元低價。一〇三號等進遞交，八九號等進即交，即回升至八二五元及八三〇元。一五七號等出遞交，塲外果而加緊，澈査電話，人心不振，下降至八一〇元及八一五元。華　由二二〇號之供給，引起浮多了結，永紗退至八〇八元八一三元，塲外拎高甚多，一四號等來進，升篇八二六元及八三六元，銀根仍緊，二二〇號趁高供給現遞，一五五號等仍出，又迫降至八一〇元及八二三元，六一號等仍進，一八六號出現進遞，一一七號等進即交，塲外喊價超前塲內達三十元之多，永紗近午交抬高到八二八元及八三四元高價，一五七號等脫手，午收爲八一九元及八二八元，較前收即交股計華新統益華豐中法跌一成，新光永公景福內衣新華跌半成，五和跌停，永紗平，餘者升降俱微。還交股華豐跌一成，景福降半成，餘股升降俱微。</p>
<p>後市僅做即交，人心仍好，塲外永紗更高至八六〇元外，一六三號等更進至八四三元。一八三號等急售，壓小到八二二元，國行差進不多，二〇六號進至八四〇元外，此後即轉入混戰局面，起仆飄忽。廣帮二〇二號等不時傾售，一一六號等再壓，而退至八一四元，收市八一五元。較晨收即交股統益新華尙平，中泥中絲跌半成，餘均小挫。塲外各未上市股票除銀行股再漲一成，大生回小半成外，餘股變化甚微。</p>
<h3>統債繼續下游外股起仆互見</h3>
<p>公債昨統丙尙有回升力量外，餘債繼續下游，統丙最開七萬元，低至六萬四，回上到七萬一左右，收市仍屈居六萬九。結果較前收計丙種尙平，甲乙跌四千元，丁戊挫二千元，成交約三百萬　外債昨仍與前日相彷彿，各股參差，英聯獨俏，紙版再渴。怡紗晨開六二萬，中途因港申電之降爲二元九而見六五萬，但臨收仍退至六一萬，洋商及證券帮出入互見。較前收計英聯升半成，紙版跌一成，怡啤會德　尙平，怡紗業廣航業鋼業微跌。</p>
<h3>中信局洽購外煤　共十萬噸運滬存儲</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕據市府消息：開　煤礦現有存煤達七十萬噸以上，詆以運輸困難，不能接濟本市之需要。現經燃料管理委員會向關係方面接治，亦經本市經濟會報決定，請中央信託局向加拿大，非律賓·海參崴等處購外煤十萬噸蓮滬存儲，以便隨時供應。購煤辦法業已商妥，本市用煤，可無恐荒。</p>
<p>煤價續高</p>
<p>煤斤市勢，邇因來源不繼，且開濼存煤以交通阻極，無法運出，台灣煤供給本省需用，出口僅二萬噸之譜，時値隆冬，各方實銷甚暢，致有底日减，市　　潔增高。</p>
<p>昨市焦作塊每噸千萬出關，至一千一百萬元，烟煤提塊七百十五萬兀，較之年底上漲有二成至四成左右。其餘各煤及煤球榮炭等行情，亦均一致狂跳。</p>
<h3>金管局負責人談　管理金融實况</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕記者昨訪金融管理局負賣人，探詢金融管理各項實際措施情形，據云：　關於行莊檢査部份，本局經常積極推進，特製成各項業務調査表格，發交各行莊　期塡報以憑審核外，對業務不穩之行莊，並隨時派員抽查，分別情節處理。此項工作，中外一體辦理，不分軒輊·　關於導引資金入生產部門，本局現已密切注意配合生產事業之需要，吸收游資，透過金融機構，轉入生產途徑。關於此項措施，本局現已根據銀行法規定，督飭各行莊按照比例放款，以應生產事業之資金需要。至於上年已停業行莊之淸理情形，據謂：本市受停業淸理處分之巴川正和兩行，均已依法淸理完竣。</p>
<h3>客帮去化呆滯　棉紗布均回軟　四二支細紗比上日挫二百萬</h3>
<p>昨日棉紗市况，紡建公司照例開售，配價未更，市塲情勢以紗花限期登記，人心虛軟，各帮去化呆頓。本街同業因銀根轉緊，多頭吐售甚夥，復製廠商絕少動辦，新買袖手，喊價邁步下游。迨至收市，四十二支藍鳳細紗做小至六千一百三十萬元，比上日回跌二百萬元。其餘廿支十六支四十支等粗細紗，亦均軋降自四五十萬至一百五六十萬及二百萬之譜。</p>
<p>棉布市况，昨最開人心堅固，買氣濃郁，　面哄提甚勁，市盤步昻。嗣至十點許，各方銀根忽告抽緊，同業斬吐頻起，本街反進為出，塲內賣風頓熾，喊價急切下瀉。迨至最後，十二磅五福等各　細布，一致回跌，自五千元至一·二萬元，全日趨勢以細斜回漲二·三萬元，色布及土林布堅挺外，其餘各布大都下游。</p>
<h3>輸管會寬放限制　准進口原料輸入</h3>
<p>中國國貨聯營公司及中華國貨產銷協會，近爲推農外銷，曾函請輸管曾輸廣處，對輸出品製造原料輸入辦法，勿過嚴格限制。該處頃已分別函覆，略稱：上項辦法，已奉行政院核准，最近期內，即可公佈。該辦法第二條規定：「凡進口原料之價値，未超過其製成品之出口價値百分之四十，或其製成品之輸出，素具歷史，有提倡價値，並經職出入管理委員會特准者，准其輸入。」根據此項規定，將來實施時，如有合於此項規定之情形者，自可適用該辦法。惟關於上項情形，希由該兩公司能提供具體資料，以備將來該會與經濟部會商適用該辦法之原料種類時之參攷。又該辦法第三條規定，進口原料必須加工製造，再行輸出，故輸入之原料，僅限於製造輸出品直接所需者，此項原則，無從變更。惟該會現已另撥補充辦法，旨在協助出口商輸入原料，增加生產，俾將增產所得產品之一部份，運銷國外，換取外匯。聞職管會已定本月內關始辦理申請手續，申請者必須保證進口之原料　成成品後，能輸出換取外匯，始能獲得核准云。</p>
<h3>食米產地價平　粳秈市况續疲</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕米市昨登記到貨共一萬三千零六十七石，產地價平，市况賡續趨疲，南市粳米及早薄稻，早跌後定，結果續挫一二萬元。秈米亦低一二萬元，白陰元去化活絡，依然挺站。北市初定後懈，給局粳秈米均挫一二萬元，白陰元亦然挺秀，供應米日前售出之貨，正在逐步出貨之中，故昨日店方大多未購，野雞墩又軋塞，蘇州河不通，途中有，不能抗行之停泊尙米船三百餘艘，亦在設法疏通之中。</p>
<p>麵粉升沉互見，廠粉回升三五千元，雜牌粉則先漲後跌，結果軋小一二千元。麩皮鄕銷不動，挫落六七千元。豆餅廠方售心尙堅，鑽升七八千元，臨收亦然轉淡。黃豆閩方略有成交，油廠揀低進取，挺升一二千元。</p>
<p>菉豆受主稀少，再削三五萬元。豇豆顧主難覓，狂跌四五萬元。蠶豆去化閒散，步跌一二萬元。赤豆零化亦懈，續疲一二萬元。紅糧供求兩少，價無榮辱。苞米北洋仍然淸淡，續挫一二萬元。芝蔴本銷轉股，回漲三五萬元。生仁廣方納胃重見活躍，疲而復振，猛騰十餘萬元。</p>
<p>油市店胃加强，雨帮徽有問津，各油相繼上升七八萬至十餘萬元不一。</p>
<h3>茶價上展</h3>
<p>內銷茶昨本街與客帮之去化，仍不稍戢，致過程活絡如故，做開行情又冉冉晋展。至於洋莊茶市，趨勢賡續堅化，價格之漲風，亦再度演進。出口商雖猶東手觀望，而執主心思仍昂，兼以成本敎增，是以喊價依然向榮。</p>
<h3>現棉沉寂</h3>
<p>昨日現棉市况，紡建代收，未曾開價，同業僅少數做開，更因紗布回軟，銀根轉緊，買戶大都觀望，故交易沉寂。全日成交二六五包，棧交價做開老河口五一六萬七千，漢細五二〇萬八千，周浦籽花一二二萬五千。</p>
<h3>人絲疲途徘徊　廠經綢貨均平穩</h3>
<p>人造絲終因實銷淸稀，欲振乏力，昨市先堅後疲，一二〇號旭字有光，上午開盤價在大百萬元之左，乏人過問，降至參百萬元收盤價，下午再軟，最後爲一百萬元賣出價，實洋爲二百萬元賣價，均比上日跌落五百萬元。</p>
<p>廠經</p>
<p>昨市交易較多，行情平穩，成交價與上日相仿，C字等級五百萬元，D字等級三百五十萬元，比上日小五十萬元。高零擔三百萬及四百萬元俱有成交，中級零擔在二百萬元左右，共有二十餘包成交，不過大多係同行互做。千經仍無成交，喊價依然未更。</p>
<p>綢貨</p>
<p>昨市堅穩，華强眞絲被面，開市後最大做到三百三四十萬元，收市降至二百九十萬元即期價，隔日期爲三百三十萬元，下午交易做開三百二十萬元，華錦縐仍在七萬元之左。總記　羽紗七萬五千元有成交，民生新霞緞廠盤十九萬五千元，其餘各貨，均呈堅定，不過成交甚稀。</p>
<h3>國藥銷旰價升</h3>
<p>國藥被外埠搜購，行方亦成日見微薄，客存亦屬不多，洋廣貨則更缺。大茴香喊高三萬元，卒以二萬八千元成交。白胡椒昨續升二萬，見廿四萬之新高價。黑胡椒被山東帮搜辦，價格超越白胡椒之上，繼升爲廿六萬。</p>
<p>北貨杏仁，週前銷路呆滯非常，曾售一萬五千元，今則產地報升，兼以運費高漲，申售之價倒掛過甚，再被外埠來客搜辦，猛升未已。計白皮府杏成交價，爲每担二百廿萬，行售拆零每斤二萬四千元。甜杏仁，藥行帮銷路徽稀，零星每斤十萬，南貨帮年貨應市，去路甚暢，向陽朔街繼續搜辦，漲勢甚勁，大有叩二十萬太關之勢。</p>

<h3>「敎育社會學」</h3>
<p>— 楊同芳</p>
<p>陳科美著·敎育講話叢書之一</p>
<p>世界書局出版</p>
<p>誠如著者在「自序」中說：「這是一本鳥瞰性質的書，也是一本介紹性質的書。」鳥瞰必須看得廣，飛得高，把各家重要的學說和各種重要的材料綜合敘述，使讀者能獲得淸哳的概念；至於介紹，那又得將讀者所欲知道的源源本本地詳略得宜地作客觀的叙說，使讀者能因此引起學習的動機。這工作並不很容易，而這本「敎育於會學」以短少的篇幅，確己做到道目的。</p>
<p>本書共分十講：第一講敎育社會學的發展，叙述了這門學術發展的歷史，首先解釋杜威所提出的兩廣意思：　社會由敎育而繼續；　敎育由社會而進行。再由輓近的社會學的硏究，說到科學的敎會社會學的建立。敎育社會學必須硏究敎育和社會的相互關係，分析各種社會團體所負的敎育的使命，以及敎育所應强調的社會的意義。這門新興的學術（自一九〇八年突飛猛進迄今不過四十年）已由純理論的硏究到應用的硏究了。</p>
<p>第二講敎育社會學的現狀，叙說這門學術的重要文獻，介紹張雪樓（W．E．Chancellor），克樂（F．R．Clow），葛雷夫　．R．Groves），史密斯（W．R．Smith），斯耐登（D．Snedden）及彼特士（C．C．Peters）的著作。作者又就敎育社會學的本質問題，說明敎育社會學的兩大派別：敎育學派和社會學派，再歸結這門學術研究的新趨勢，兼顧社會和敎育二方面，旣要研究社會的事象，也要硏究敎育的事象。</p>
<p>第三講敎育社會學的領域，分別叙述敎育社會學所要研究的項目：　搜集人類如何生活於社會團體中的原理；　說明各種社會團體對於其他社會團體的影響，　硏究各種社會團體所需要的敎育；　指出學校對於其他社會團體的使命；　了解各種社會團體對於敎育的使命；　聞釋敎育和社會制裁，遺傳汶進步的關係。至於硏究的範圍，所關涉到的有　敎育社會學和敎育心理學；　敎育社會學和敎育哲學；以及　敎有社會學和社會敎育的硏究。</p>
<p>第四第五兩講敎育和社會的關係，分作敎育和社會組織的關係；敎育和社會制裁的關係；敎育和社會遺傳的關係以及敎育和社會進步的關係四方面中述。各種社會團體，依其結合方式的不同，分爲三類：第一類稱爲初級團體，如家庭，遊伴，隣里等；第二類稱爲次級團體，如國家，國際等，第三類稱爲中級團體，如職業團體，學術團體等。要使兒童和靑年對這些社會團體有良好的適應，便應以敎育的力量，謀個人與社會團體關係的協調。敎育和社會制裁的關係，則可於宗敎和敎育，法律和敎育以及與論和敎育之間的關係中看出。教育和社會遺傳的關係尤共不容忽視，社會遺傳要靠敎育的推進，因爲教育的作用即在傳遞社會遺產，使優良的文化能傳之後代，人類的生活經驗亦因以保留下去。最後著者在申論敎育和社會進步的關係時，特別說明敎育之創造的價値。「可知欲求社會的進步，無論從生物的觀點或從社會的觀點，均須偕助於敎育；這就因爲敎育是基本的工作，是推動社會的一種力量。」</p>
<p>第六講敎育和社會原理，著者就敎育和民主主義，敎育和社會效軍以及敎育和文化槪念三方面立論，中心思想不開敎育之民本的理想。現代社會生活的特徽可說是民主的，也就是大衆化；效率的，也就是實際化；文化的，也就是文明化。欲求現代生活的擴充和進涉，一定要靠敎育家的努力。</p>
<p>第七講敎育調査，這是應用社會學的方法於敎育的研究和實施。對於與敎育調查有關的史實，書中有扼要的敘述。調査的內審，舉其重要者有：　學校性質和敎育需要；　校舍和設備；　行政組織；　敎師；　編制；　課程；　敎學；　學校和社會關係。敎育調査對敎育實施及敎育學術質獻都很大，能使行政與學理打成一片，而敎育學術也使成爲眞實致用的學術，不僅是空洞的理論了。</p>
<p>第八講學校行政，這裏並非學校行政的泛論，而是從社會的觀點，說明學校行政之必須强調社會的意義。著者把學校行政分爲兩方面：一方面可稱之爲外部的學校行政，亦即國家和公衆對於學校的一般管理；另一方面可稱之爲內部的學校行政，亦即學校職員對於學校的專門管理。</p>
<p>第九講課程，這是敎育社會學所要硏究的主要課題，課程是敎育的內容，而敎育的內容必須根據社會的需要，當然也不能無視兒童身心發展的順序。著者又依據敎育社會學的理論與方法，說明課程改造的趨勢，業很有價値的研究。</p>
<p>第十講敎導方怯，所討諭的包括敎導方法和課程的關係，敎學方怯的意義及中心原理。更就個別的和團體的敎學方法，加以申述。對於社會化敎學，也有適當的批評。最後則叙說訓導之社會的意義，發揮自由精神和民主思想。</p>
<p>陳氏的這本書，雖不能說是一本學術巨著，但以小小篇輻却能使讀者鳥瞰到敎育社會學的本質，重要的理論和方怯都可以把握到了。筆者讀了本書，覺得硏究敎育旣不能偏重心理學，也不能偏重社會學，而在於淸楚地認識個人心理的發展與社會現象之間的關係。敎育的目的在於在整個社會之中，充分發展個性（個人的主動力和創造力），使個體能各盡所能，為社會增進　利。要達到這目的，必須改　課程，使符合社會需要，使受敎育者養成一種正常的健全的「人格」（Personality），而這種人格又是適合社會性的。當然，在敎學方法上也要步趨這個理想，注意社會環境對於個人生活熊度所發生的種種影響。</p>
<h3>歐洲戰史</h3>
<p>— 儲玉坤</p>
<p>唐子長著　永祥印書館出版　共分八册</p>
<p>關於第二次世界大戰的著作，在英美出版界，相繼出版的，有如雨後春筍；我國出版界雖然相形見絀，但以視第一次世界大戰之後，已見進步了。記得第二次世界大戰之後，中國出版界僅有張乃燕氏之「歐洲戰史」一書的出版，而且這部歐戰史，是譯述的性質，而非眞正的著作·但是在第二次世界大戰之後，已有好幾本的著作及譯述出版；例如拙作第二次世界大戰史，是偏重在國際間的外交活動，而對於戰爭的推移，並不十分重視，所以略而不詳。但是我們看了唐子長先生的大作歐洲戰史，對於歐戰的經過，敘述得非常詳盡，全書凡一百五十萬字，共分八册：　歐戰引端；　中歐戰塲；　北歐戰學；　西歐戰塲；　南歐戰塲；　東歐戰塲；　歐洲堡壘；　歐戰總評。</p>
<p>不論其內容如何？在貧乏的中國出版界，有此鉅著出版，終是一件値得稱道的事情，至少可以看出中國學術的獨立性，不再依賴外人的著作了。這一個進步，尤其値得我們的珍視。故特介紹與讀者諸君。</p>
<p>第一册歐戰引端，不僅聞明第二次世界大戰爭爆發的原因：　凡兩賽和約的影響；　世界性戰爭的激盪；　歐洲列强政界衝突；　歐洲列强軍備競爭，而且把歐戰的經過，加以簡略的敘述，一直到希特勒投降歐戰結束爲止。這一册可以視爲緒論，也可以視爲一個單位，有其獨立性。</p>
<p>第二册中歐戰塲，以德波戰爭爲中心，首先說明中歐的地理形勢，追記德奧合併及捷克支解的經過，並指出納粹德國對於中歐的野心，終因波蘭問題爆發而爲歐洲大戰。這是歐洲戰爭的序幕，德國對波蘭採取閃電戰略，不及一月而大捷，作者唐子長將軍，長於軍略，對於閃電戰略的得失，評述甚詳。</p>
<p>第三册北歐戰塲，完全敍述芬蘭之戰與挪威之戰的經過，但是該書最大的特色，乃在許述海戰與空軍的關係，簡單言之，海上戰爭的勝敗，完全取決於雙方空軍的優劣，而海軍的强弱，反而居於次要地位了，這是與第一次世界大戰不同的地方。</p>
<p>第四册西歐戰塲，以法德戰爭爲中心，對於法蘭西的悲劇，敍述甚祥。</p>
<p>第五册南歐戰塲，包括的範圍甚廣，北至巴爾幹半島，南至菲洲，養大利與近東，也包括在內。這一個戰塲，稱爲南歐戰塲，是否切當？尙待商榷。</p>
<p>第六册東歐戰塲，完全敍述德蘇戰爭的經過，但對於德蘇雙方所採取的戰略，評述甚詳。質言之，德國對於蘇聯也採取閃電戰略，但欲求速戰速決爲不可能，乃自陷於錯誤之境。而蘇聯紅軍之戰略，一方面爭取時間；而另一方面，又從事全體性之戰爭，卒使橋軍之閃電戰略歸於失敗。</p>
<p>第七册歐洲堡壘，從歐陸上空的空戰開始，一直說到第二戰塲的開闢，東西兩錢的會師，攻隕柏林，使德國不得不無條件投降。</p>
<p>第八册歐戰總評，對於兵器與科學，評述尤詳，最値得研究國防及軍事的人們注意。</p>
<p>要之，唐子長將軍的歐洲戰史，是一部偏於軍界及兵器的著作，可供硏究軍事學者的參考，過去我國軍人，常以係子兵法爲必讀之物，這一部歐洲戰史，實可作爲必讀的參考書。但是也有其缺點，就是對於這次大戰的性質，缺乏正確的認識，我們不能一不以此認爲美中不足。</p>
<h3>「兒童繪畫之心理」</h3>
<p>— 溫肇桐</p>
<p>（黃寞著　商務印警館出版）</p>
<p>在十二月四日的本刋上，介紹了選譯的「兒童繪畫心理之硏究」以後，繼續需要介紹國人僅有的一册硏究兒童繪畫心理的專書「兒童繪賓之心理」，這是廿六年頃，浙江大學培育院黃冀所著的。敍述了他多年研究的收穫。</p>
<p>這本書最重要的部分，自然是第三單「發展的程序」，原是運用「團體法」的硏究來觀察兒童繪畫的一般特點，換句話說：就是兒童的描繪心理的發達一般程序而已。</p>
<p>黃翼斷定兒童繪畫的發展程序分：　塗鴉期，　象徵期或過渡期，　定型期，　寫實期。</p>
<p>大約是實年三歲至四歲的兒童，他們的繪畫，就在「塗鴉期」中，塗鴉是眞正繪畫的先驅，這時候所畫的，是一些無意義的筆劃，起初是像波形的，進一步是圓形的，第三步是多形的，但兒童從此得到控制手臂和筆紙的練習。這種塗鴉，和語言的發音遊戲很可以互相比較。發音遊戲也是無意義，多重復，偏於動作節奏的活動，而對於眞正的語言，也有預備練習的功用。</p>
<p>從「塗鴉期」過渡到眞正的繪畫，必然要經過一個「象徵期或過渡期」，這一時期的繪畫，雖然還和塗鴉差不多，但已可說明自己所畫的事物是什麼；或先宣稱要畫的事物是什麼，而動筆實年五歲到六歲的兒童繪畫，可說完全會有這樣的傾向。</p>
<p>兒童繪畫的黃金時代是實年七歲到十歲，兒童非常高興自由表現，自由創造，不過，他們所描繪的形象，並不是完全正確，正在其缺乏形象的正確性的要素，便獨特地表現了兒童繪書的稚拙，原始，單純，素樸的趣味。</p>
<p>著者大約也爲了這些理由，在這個階段裏，收集了中外各家硏究的資料與成果，化費了佔全書大約四分之一的篇幅來加以縝密的研究與叙述。首先硏究了兒童畫人的演進，斷定是從　蝌蚪人，　漸益完備的正面人，　側面人，　動作，而演進的。又把　獸類，　房屋，　樹，　花，　模倣畫等的實例加以硏究，分析出這一個時期兒童繪畫的特點如下：</p>
<p>顯然不是仔細的描寫，而只是一種簡略的速寫和設計圖的圖形，且不顧實物個別差異的變化，而只是呆板的，固定的，拘執於一定格式的模型或公式。</p>
<p>所描物體的部分，往往殘缺不全，而且取去極爲主觀。</p>
<p>和遺漏重要的部分似乎相反的毛病，是將一些不看見的東西反描了進去。所謂兒童繪畫的透明描寫，就是指這種特點說的</p>
<p>把一樣物體的部分，移描到另一樣物體上吿的奇特錯誤。</p>
<p>比例不符合實際狀態。</p>
<p>由於機械化了的自動，往往一動手會連續作同樣的描着。如：描手指會多了幾個。</p>
<p>物體空間配置與組織關係的不正確。</p>
<p>物體的顛倒，歪斜等朝向的不正確。</p>
<p>物體的平面描繪。</p>
<p>對物體觀點的移轉。如：應爲側的，仍描爲正視的。</p>
<p>物體遠近大小的不合理。</p>
<p>幼童不能　模仿畫或寫生。雖然把實物或本放在他面前，但畫的時候，仍舊是照自由畫的方式去畫，而成績也不比自由好畫。</p>
<p>至於兒童畫為什麼會有這些特點的？據「機能心理」學者的說法是由於「能力缺憾」；另一種是「演化」，和生物形體的演化極為相似的說法。於是對兒童繪畫的心理便　定的下了一條歷來公認的原則：「兒童畫他所知道的，不是畫他所看見的。」莫不率為金科王律了。</p>
<p>著者是根據了完形心理學的「最好完形律」（Law　of　Pragnanz）與物理學而觀察兒童描繪的物體都有成功一種簡單整齊，而又固定呆板的定型的趨向。特別是圓形和橢圓形，只要略可牽合，無不到處應用、因爲這是最簡單完整的形狀。這也正是由於「知覺固定性」中硏究得來。更可以說：兒童繪畫不是由於「之：著者便把這條公認的原則，是根據他的抽象知識，而是根據他在自然態度之下所直接看見的。畫家作畫才是根據他用特殊的看法所看見的；畫家的看怯，倒是需要學問知識和訓練。方才可能。」兒童繪畫上的錯誤，確實是自然的表現，敎兒議美術的人，應該特別予以注意的。</p>
<p>「定型期」以後，便是「寫實期」了。大約在實年十歲左右，兒意開始獲得寫實的眼光，對於自己的作品，看出種種不滿意的地方，開始感覺到技術的問題了。此後有兩種不同的發展趨勢：第一是有天才和有機會受良好訓練的兒童，他們繼讀發展，達到藝術上寫實的境界，他們學會用畫家的眼光去觀察事物，分析物體在各種觀點之下光綫投射的實狀，正確地表現立體感與遠近感，並得到構圖上的協調與藝術上的美的特殊意境和情味。但大多數的兒童却是一個可悲的遭遇：他們眼高手低，自餒，前期的那種天眞爛漫的自信，漸漸消失一般的訓練不足以彌補天才的缺乏。在這種自覺，遲疑，抑制之下，便自動放棄這種遊戲了。呌他們描晝時常常要愧謝不敏。於是技術也就不再進步，大多數的成人，一生的藝術造就未嘗超過較高級的定型期或是初步的寫實期。就是社會美術文化的停滯，間接的原因，也許也在這裏。所以，兒童美術敎師，對於十歲以後見童的美術敎學，也必作着另一個打算才好呢。</p>
<p>本書又敍述了兒童繪晝心理上「硏究的方怯，」以及「個別差異和圖晝測騐」，「兩性差異」，「各種民族兒東的圖畫」之「兒童圖畫與兒童心理的各方面」，「兒競繪畫和原始民族繪畫之比較」，以汶「敎育上的結論」諸章，別具見地。但，對於第三章如果能够很澈底的理解之後，這許多便成爲技節的間題了。</p>
<h3>「安蒂小姐」</h3>
<p>— 薇莎</p>
<p>陶冰女士著　中國圖書雜誌公司出版</p>
<p>我們喜愛文學，喜愛藝術，因爲它是反映人生，美化沉浮在塵俗中的人心的。抗戰勝利後，出版界在紙貴洛陽的今天，祗有翻賣陳著；再加作家生活不安定，新的文藝創作顯得貧乏。</p>
<p>因之，「飄」與「虎魄」在中國就獲得了大量讀者的歡迎。當然，美·密契爾女士和英·雯莎女士的成功不是偶然的，其故事動人，文筆幽秀，不僅是一部小說而已，它更是一個時代歷史的寫照，在英美暢銷使他們的人民緬懷他們祖先創業與奮門的淸神。</p>
<p>我們不能永遠看「紅樓夢」來逃避現實，祗有以翻譯小說來滿足我們飢渴的求知慾和　澗枯燥的心靈。中國的女作家因爲生活　子的狹小，他們離不開都市，故少塊　的浩瀚創作。抗戰開始到現在整整十年，僅看到一本鳳子女士的「無聲的歌女」。</p>
<p>我欣悅的向愛好文學的朋友們介紹，今年元旦出版的「安蒂小姐」十四萬言的創作小說，它使我含淚在溫暖的陽光中讀完了。安蒂是女人中的丈夫，是女學生中的英雄，是戀愛中的聖潔貞堅而超人的婦人，是職業婦女耐受折磨向社會呼籲的代言人，是舞女遭受摧殘的心聲的抒情吶喊。其中故事是親切而眞實的，人物是有血有肉生動的，筆調樸實，流暢，雋永。是一部震驚文壇的寫實創作，我們向這位新作家歡呼，我們希望她更努力地產生更深一層的人生悲愴和受難的女性孤苦掙扎的發掘，細膩描寫。</p>
<p>「安蒂小姐」是震撼人心的，曾中女中翁安蒂在病弱暮年的祖母敎養下，在寡母貧困的撫育中，她以聰明的智慧，過人的優良成績護得了賢明的師長的獎勵。安蒂在恩惠的翼羽下豐滿她的學識，她家貧寒不能讀完小學的環境，居然傳奇式的把握五六年考試第一名在免費中完成高中學業。她在這辛酸的童年成長時代，超人的勝利使殘年中的祖母以喜悅的　藉，同時羅家的希望都寄托在她的身上。安蒂自知，她的任務是代替逝世的父親來取得工作，膽養社母，母親和幼弟。</p>
<p>在舊禮敎下孕育出來的她，受到第一次愛的挑殘，她祖母把她强迫獻給了僞善的商人，一個僞裝愛情的欺騙者楊震亞之手，因爲他用稍小的金錢把安蒂一家從飢餓中援救出來，可是在他獲得了純眞如碧運的安蒂，滿足獸慾後，一脚踢開了羅家老小三代，使羅老太太氣死，使安蒂心碎而正視殘酷的人生，使她必需以獨立的人格生存人間和以工作爭取男女平等地位的向上意志更堅强。她是孝女，自願忍受心靈的毀滅，把她鍾情的老師的情絲斯斷，她勇敢犧牲了她美麗的理想和幸福。正因爲她如此，羅老太太在臨終時不能瞑目了，懺悔與憎恨人心的險惡，對她一手培植的嫩草經暴風雨浸學後的愛憐，在她彌留中，留戀冷冰冰的世界，盼望能回歸故鄕的庭園，重溫創傷土地，再度官家溫馨恬寗的生活，這正象徵舊家庭的破烕，舊禮敎的死亡，終於羅老太太帶著她的思想人土了。安蒂像海燕飛翔海洋，她長遠航行的戰鬥淸神，被假起用女職員的魔手揑毀了，奔波在坎坷的人生道途中她敗退了，在不合理的社會中一個懐有眞才實學的女人不能獲得能使一家溫飽的工作。懐着她離婚後的孩子，一個出世即被　棄的無單小生命，到處遭遇白眼，沒有交際的手段，崇貴自己潔白的靈魂的女人是多難找到一個甚至連小學敎員的位置。在幼小嗷嗷待哺，母弟顚沛在飢寒到上，安蒂徘徊的心，震盪的意志動搖了，受了一個同命運的女友的勸告，投身舞塲伴舞，她痛心地獻出靑春和美貌，可是她仍爲初戀的情人秦璇保特永恒的戀情，這生活的苦藥，愛情的苦果，她含悲地吞食着。最後，在她橫遭凌辱與損害，在她以眼淚和孤苦培植出的孩子夭逝後，母親　開悽慘人間和幼弟遠行後，更在愛人喪生於飛機中，她結束了，殘餘生命，投入茫茫江中，像連花出自汙泥而復歸泥土，充滿人情味的故事使我哭了。</p>

<h3>老鼠的殘肴</h3>
<p>— 何苦</p>
<p>辦公室裏有老鼠，但是我沒有看見過，因爲白天老鼠決不會出來。但何以知道辦公室裏有嚴重的鼠患呢？那是每天早晨，當我把抽屜用鑰匙打開時便會一目了然的。抽屜裏全是一些橘皮，果核，紙屑，甚至還有尿汚。每天坐下來辦公之前，必先要爲昨在出來的老鼠收拾殘肴，牠們是興盡而歸，打掃的工作却只由我們萬物之靈的人類爲牠代勞。</p>
<p>這幾天已是迫近陰歷年關，民間傳說此時本有老鼠做親等節目，說不定這幾夜老鼠的忙碌，正與人類討媳婦嫁女兒想等，則晚問的一頓大嚼，也是題中應有之義，想到了這點，我爲老鼠出淸殘肴，就感到心平氣和了。</p>
<p>不過引起我的注意力者乃是老鼠的食糧問題。辦公室裏難得有橘子難，果核，至於麵包屑乃是絕無僅有的，要經常維持老國的生存，這些食糧從而來？</p>
<p>後來終於有一天給我發現，有一雙漿糊罐上面的小刷帶，忽然不見了，經過尋找之後，終於在抽屜一角紙屑殘殺堆中發現！老鼠爲舐取帶上的漿糊，可憐連刷帶上的短　都搜括而去，而我們放在桌子上的漿糊，一小半用掉，一大半是供給老鼠作爲經常的食糧。這種漿糊是由一家名爲「衛生包月漿糊公司」每隔兩二天來送一次，我至今才知道了命名的用意，原來所謂「衛生」也者，即是保衛老鼠生命的意思。</p>
<p>不要看輕一頭小小的老鼠，即便有老鼠籠子，陷阱四伏，牠們還是多方設法在艱難中我尋可吃的東西，來維護自己的生命，牠們從來不求敎別人，牠們只知道自力更生，這在人類社會，某一種寄生的人們對之是應該羞慚得無地自容的。</p>
<p>談金鋼鑽　毛毅</p>
<p>印度是金鋼鑽的最早的來源地。產生在印度的砂礫層中的金鋼鐵是由遠古的沖積層演化而得的，而這種冲積層則是十億年前太古時期的山中的物質被蝕而演化出來的。</p>
<p>這些由炭元素結晶而成的鑽石，到了後來便被人們在河床和河岸中發掘出來，有時也在乾涸了的古代的河道中被發現。古代的印關土人的「淘鑽」怯，還能在今日的錫蘭看到—他們在礦區的砂礫上挖出一個個的淺坑，把挖出的砂礫用節子篩過，再用水洗淘，如果幸運的話，便能獲得貴重的結晶品。</p>
<p>在十八世紀以前，印度的鑽石業是世界市塲的壟斷者，但是，自從一七二五年金鋼鑽又被在巴西發現了之後，東方的鑽石業便關始衰微了。巴西的鑽石和印度的一樣，也是蓄藏在古代的砂礫層中的。巴西礦對世界的鑽石量增加了可觀的數額，可是，它們的產量與發現更遲的非洲礦比較起來，則又瞠乎其後了。據估計，在八十年以前，全世界所出土的大於三十克拉的金鋼鑽，不會超過一百顆。</p>
<p>在南菲洲所發現的第一顆金鋼鑽是在一八六七年由幾個荷蘭移民的兒童在奧倫治河的河岸上檢到的；共餘的金鋼鑽則是在次年被在瓦爾河與奧倫治河的匯合處發現的。當一個郝坦吐蠻族人在一八六九年檢到一塊八十三克拉半的大鑽石的時候，「淘鑽潮」便開始了。淘鑽者的帳幕櫛比鱗次的沿河皆是。後來，金鋼鑽在遠離河流的地方也有發現，這些地方便被稱作「乾礦區」，它們原是乾涸了的古代的河道。</p>
<p>乾礦區的表層是一片黃土，可是，從黃土層往下挖，深至五十呎到六十呎的時候，便呈現出藍土層，這就是鑽石的藏身之所，經過淘洗之後，它們便重見天日了。</p>
<p>除了古河道所造成的礦區之外，南非洲還有火山噴射所造成的橄欖岩堆積層，也是金鋼鑽的源泉。世界最大的橄攪岩堆積層是在普利陶立亞附近的「首相礦」。它的最粗的直徑超過半　，掩覆七十八英畝的土地，被掘的深度已近七百呎。世界上最大的金鋼鑽「柯立南」便是於一九〇五年在這裏被發現的。這顆巨大的鑽石重三千零二十五克拉（合一又三分之一磅）。假如用法幣計値，恐怕天文數字亦將黯然失色。</p>
<h3>漠然</h3>
<p>— 秦文</p>
<p>有了刺激，必定有反應。從心理上講，人類由於環境的刺激，就能通過領　而作適當的反應，可是只要經過一個相當的時候，也就對這刺激習以為常，安之若素，必需要有更新的變化，才能產生新的反應·「習慣成自然」，雖是諺語，却是符合心理學上理論的正確定律。</p>
<p>所以當劉佬佬進了大觀園，一個生長在窮鄕僻瓖小戶人家的老婆子，驟然到了富麗華貴　者淫佚的豪門別　裏來，所見所開，當然感到不知所措而侷促羞澀·這就是爲了整個生活方式的突然異樣，於是據此刺激，生成的反應除了目瞪口呆外，或則羨慕欽佩，或則厭惡不慣，但是祇要住上半年三個月，一切司空見慣，「見怪不怪，其怪自敗」，西洋鏡已被戮穿，便無足爲奇了。我們當然並不贊同環境決定一切的機械論調，但雖也不能否認環境對於個人身心影響的鉅大，「入芝蘭之室，久而不聞其香，鮑魚之肆，久而不聞其臭」。孟母所以要三擇其鄰者，還不是爲了讓她的兒子不被環境薰陶得迷迷糊糊，學些好榜樣而已。</p>
<p>從嚴　不阿的生活態度中，走向糜爛，起初總是不願同流合汚，覺得難以相容，久而久之，就漠然處之，並且打成一片，同黑暗水乳交融，無所謂禮義廉恥了，墮落的人，總是從格格不入到漠然，從漢然而沆　一氣。所以「漢然」這一階段，往往是態度改變的轉捩點。到了「漠然」這田地，挽回就很困難。神經麻木不仁的人，什麼也提不起勁兒，譬如一泓死水，偶然因爲一粒石子而起了些漣漪，不一會使歸於無形，再也引不起浪花的了。</p>
<p>「惻隱之心，人皆有之」，人原是富於同情心的動物，可是一天到晚碰到乞丐，對乞丐就漠然處之　一年到頭聽到砲聲槍聲，對戰事也就漠然處之，無時無日不看到難民盜賊，對凍斃自殺也就漠然處之，不勝其同情的時候，也就損失了同情。總有一天世界會像氷製的一樣，到處都是寒冷罷？</p>
<h3>宋高宗與張俊</h3>
<p>— 鄭過宜</p>
<p>宋中興名將稱張（俊）韓（世忠）劉（錡）岳（飛），以張俊爲之冠。徒以晚節不終，附秦繪意，贊成和議，且忌刻劉岳成功，致至今鑄像西湖，唾　未已，此功名富貴一念誤之也。</p>
<p>然張俊於此之外，其統師有「鐵山軍」之軍，亦未嘗無捍患衛國之勞。中興遺史云；「張價狀貌雄偉，性渾原嚴重，征行戍守師律整齊，納亡撫降，皆能得其死力。」林泉野記云：「俊愛惜士卒，賞罰明信，先計後戰，故未嘗敗焉。」皆稱之者甚至，故吾於張俊之不堅初志，實深致惋惜焉。憔張俊之所以出此，殆窺探高宗之意而然，觀高宗決意欲殺岳飛，而不喜韓世忠，於俊死後，䘏典異常，又稱美不容口，其心事可知。建炎以來繫年要錄載：「紹興二十四年秋七月癸丑，安民靖難功臣太師靜江寗武靖海軍節度使醴泉觀使淸河郡王張俊　於行在，年六十九。翌日，輔臣進呈，上曰：張俊遽亡，　者張通古來，使極宜力，與韓世忠等不同，恩數宜從優厚。遂賜貂冠朝服以斂，命內侍省押班張去爲護喪事，俊晚年主和議，與泰槍意合，上厚春之。」又云：「八月丙午，禮部擬定張俊贈典，乞依韓世忠例。先是上論秦檜曰：武臣無如張俊者，比韓世忠相去萬萬，贈典宜令有司檢討視宗故事，務從優厚，及是進呈，上曰：俊在明受間，有兵八千屯吳江，朱勝非降指揮與秦州差遺，俊不受，進兵破賊，實爲有功，可贈與小國一字王，令禮部擬定。於是特封眞王，其追封鹽以後，異姓不封眞王，共追封籃自俊始。使葬無錫縣，將相州郡祭之者接迹，江左以爲榮。」張俊身後之恩寵如此。以上所謂張通古者，乃金邦來約和好者也。而所謂「明受間進兵破賊」，則高宗復辟之事也。當明受間高宗爲苗傅劉正彥所廢囚，其復辟實張俊韓世忠之功居多，韓仳忠且生致苗劉，獻俘庭闕，如張俊之附於驥尾者，何足以云？乃謂之「比韓世忠相去萬萬」，此何語也。其意蓋在張通古之來約和，不在明受復辟明甚。韓世忠之忠勇志節與岳飛同，而始終倔强不附和議，亦與岳飛同，然而飛死而世忠不死者，則以世忠立功高於岳飛，爵位亦崇，高宗與秦檢離於藉口下手，殺飛正所以使世忠至懼也·朱文公（幕）日：「飛死，於是韓世忠破贍」，此一語，巴盡當日情實矣。蓋高宗於諸將之中，忌韓世忠岳飛最甚，飛之粗率，又過於世忠，故飛卒誅死，而世忠亦幾幾乎不免焉·高宗外畏金人如虎，內　諸將之不受命，惟恐一日不得安於其位，張俊探知已久，其君臣早相喩於心，是以覺朝廷欲罷諸將之極，遂首乞納兵，及金再陷楚泗　揚州，俊終不出兵渡江，以堅和議，皆深中高宗之意。高宗於世忠，待過陽予，視諸將最厚，與岳飛詔旨，亦溫語疊疊，與張俊語，每多摧折吿戒之辭，而卒之飛旣獲罪，於世忠亦有貶辭，及俊死，稱謂之美如此，則知高宗厚遇世忠，及溫慰岳飛，乃深畏其他日之逼已，而責俊獨嚴，正以心腹視之，俊安敢不主和議，　　岳飛，以爲家門之計或？吾故日：俊之罪，實高宗成之，微俊，飛亦死耳，斯探本論之也。然則其長跽岳墳，遺臭千載，亦寃矣哉！</p>
<h3>向郵局建議</h3>
<p>— 芒</p>
<p>郵費的加價引起行政院與立法院的一塲風波，現在加價已不成問題，不過，以後是否能够保持原價，還是一個問題，因爲物價漲得太快了！</p>
<p>郵資爲什麼要漲價？原因當然是爲了開支大，據郵政總局說，單是印許多郵票就要好些錢，再加很大的開支，當然不够支用，也就不得不出之於漲價一途，可是，國營事業不斷的漲價，至少對於物價曾有點影響。</p>
<p>我們能呌郵資不加嗎？這是辦不到的事，那麼，有什麼更好的方怯來解決遭個問題呢？我認爲：美國的方法還値得模倣，就是以信封，信箋和郵票合成一體，由郵局印售一種特製的信封，信封的內面當信箋，信封上再加印郵票，寄信者只須寫好後合　起來，再用漿糊一粘就是了，這樣，以印淸美郵票的手續和工資，足够印成信封，信箋和郵票在一起的信件了。</p>
<p>採用此法，似乎有很多的便利：</p>
<p>郵局的便利—現在郵局已有標準信封和標準信箋的創製，又要印許多郵票，不但手續繁多，而且所耗之金錢亦多，用印成三種一體的新信封，信箋後，可以節省許多開支，而且形式大小一律，對郵務員也有莫大的便利，而且也可節省許多紙張的消耗。</p>
<p>寄信者的便利—寄信者只須向郵局購此信對，不必再買信箋和郵票，可以免去許多瑣碎的麻煩。</p>
<p>旣然有此便利，郵局何不試行，敢以此獻之郵政當局。</p>
<h3>緬甸　（上）</h3>
<p>— 凌霄漢閣</p>
<p>緬甸於茲歲首（一九四八年一月四日）宣吿獨立，歐亞美各大國皆致賀致祝，此亦新時代一大事。</p>
<p>亞洲大陸第一大國，惟我中華，其東則朝鮮日本琉球，西北則蒙藏各部，西南則印緬　越，如衛星然，淸代對西北西南屢用兵，尤以乾隆六十年中，號稱「十全武功」，而以降緬甸爲十功之一。西北方面固顯著開疆闢土之成績，西南熱帶地面烟瘴之區，未有征服之實也。乾隆十八年，　境兩土司自相攻，緬人干涉，乘隙內侵，由此成爲淸緬間之糾紛。總督劉藻以事情棘手自盡，大學士楊應應繼任，以斯誤失機賜死。將軍明瑞督師進攻，與大將觀音保俱陣亡。乾隆怒而且憤，降論云；此等荒徼，本不値用兵，但已欲罷不能，遂簡任皇親大學士傅恒爲經略，大臣阿桂率猛將重兵，大舉南征。臨行密屬，只須得一二勝仗，挽回天朝體面，即班師。傅恒等大隊人馬，自北京出發，浩浩蕩蕩，先聲專人，悉銳進攻，果然連贏數陣，緬王畏而請款，淸人亦藉此收塲。遂爲「朝貢國」。（朝貢國但按時節進貢，備賀表禮物，完成小邦對「天朝」之儀式，如朝鮮，緬甸，　羅，越南，內政皆完全自主，例行之上朝入貢事宜，則由「禮部」接待。與西北蒙藏各處之有欽差駐紮，歸「理藩部」管理者不同。）</p>
<p>一八八五，因中法戰後訂約，法併越南（安南），次年，英即併緬甸，如交奏之歌曲。　羅則以兩力夾持而自主·中國西南部藩籬盡撤，此淸光緒十一二年間之事。</p>
<p>緬甸屬英之後，與印度聯成一片，單稱是Burme，在英屬地圖上爲印度之一部分（Governed　as　a　part　of　British　India）。六十年來，雖在外力統治之下，仍保持其文化風俗。因物產豐饒，生活相當舒適，而今宣告獨立，恢復政權。然詳察英緬協定中第六七八條關於英債款英商業，第四條之國防各節，則正如緬總理泰金努氏所云，「眞正的獨立，要在經濟問題解決之後。首須內部團結，百倍艱苦，走長斯建設之路，否則軍事，政治，經濟，又將間接予人以控制之機緣。」確是老成遠識，深切著明。我中華在抗戰期中曾派大軍入緬境協力殲敵，是患難之友，故知此次獨立，自元首以下致誠懇之賀詞，決非泛泛之儀式，實有深切之意議·</p>
<h3>逍遙花</h3>
<p>— 陳慎言</p>
<p>第六章　禍不單行（四二）</p>
<p>渚齊深知道雲卿的心情，外冷內熱，在你不痛快的時候，她會細心體貼安慰你，在你興高采烈常兒，她會給你一個軟釘子吃，呌你哭笑不得，於是緊縐眉頭，搖一搖頭道：「沒什麼可說的，這種家庭，我寗願出家常和尙。」雲卿道：「你又是和你太太生氣嗎，新婚幾個月，那有天天和太太吵架的？」渚齋道：「對這種人沒什麼可說的，大處不算小處算，眼光太短，幹的事呌人雖堪，再由她的性幹下去，我的朋友，全給他得罪光了！」雲卿道：「到底爲什麼事？」渚齋道：「沒什麼可說的，我打今天起不再回家，由她一人幹去！」雲卿道：「你也說明自，爲了什麼事，如此恨她·」渚齋道：「他的罪狀，可說罄竹難書。」雲卿道：「何至於此！她腦筋有時不淸楚，可是心情是忠厚的，你一切原諒她好了！」渚齊道：「我自結婚到現在，對她無日不在原諒之中，現在是忍無可忍，非和他離婚不可！」雲卿道：「你口口聲聲喊離婚，這種事情家庭能允許嗎？」渚齋道：「我淸神上所受刺激太大了，再醖釀下去，我這人要發瘋！我不管家庭允許不允許，即使我不能正式和她離婚，無形之中，也要和她離婚；我永遠不回家，呌她一輩子坐冷板凳好了！」雲卿道：「你這樣辦法，太絕情了。」渚齋道：「環境迪出來，我不能不這樣辦。她果然聰明，自已提出離婚，我可以給她相當瞻養費，不然，我就這樣把她擱在一旁，由她受罪。」雲鄕道：「她不肯和你正式離婚，你一蜚子也不能再娶呀！」渚齊道：「在法律上，她不離婚我再娶是犯軍婚罪，可是在法律之外，未嘗沒辦法。何况我的自的不達到，就一輩子不再娶，也沒什麼不可以的！」雲卿一聽「自的未達到」這一句，很是動心，暗忖他至今意念，還沒改變，他能和他太太離婚，第二步當然耍賤前言，追到我身上，達到他最初目的了。他未忘情，我又何嘗忘了當初志願呢！我一向忍痛在心，爲了顧全顏面，什麽意思都不敢表現，現在他旣有這意念，我不但不該反對，須要贊助他才對。雲卿腦筋轉念到此，兩目低垂，咬備嘴唇，手中祇絞着手絹，一語不發。</p>

After Wang's report, the attendees spoke one after another on the Kowloon City incident, and the emotions were high for a while.

<h3>No More Currency Inflation; Xu Kan and Yu Hongjun Expressed Views; The Senate Standing Committee Decides to Offer Opinions on the General Budget</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 14th] The national general budget for the first half of the 37th year totals more than 9.6 billion yuan. When it was first drafted by the Ministry of Finance, this was the total amount of expenditures, while revenues only accounted for 61.2%. After review by the Special Review Committee of the State Council, it was considered that revenue and expenditure must be balanced. Since it is not easy to reduce expenditures, efforts should be made to increase revenue. The 38.8% shortfall should be made up for with other taxes. The first is the 30 trillion yuan special relief donation, and the second is tax reform, using the income from prepaid taxes to make up for it. Xu Kan, Director of Budget, and Yu Hongjun, Minister of Finance, stated regarding this year's budget that there will be no currency to make up for it this year, that is, there will be no further currency inflation, and efforts will be made to prevent it from being added to again.</p>

According to Wu's report to reporters: Their opinions can be roughly concentrated on the following principles, and their review opinion letter will be drafted based on these principles: (A) Appropriate control should be exercised over expenditures to ensure that the amount of expenditures does not deviate further and further from the budget. (B) The revenue part, where those already included in the budget, must not be left empty, that is, those that have been clearly identified as revenue must be verified and received. (C) It is recommended to reform the currency system as soon as possible, so that prices will not fluctuate excessively and the value of the currency will not fall at any time during this budget period. (D) Efforts should be made to increase revenue, such as taking political methods against wealthy capital to make them donate. (E) For expenditures such as national defense expenditures, which account for 41.2% of the total budget, efforts must be made to ensure that the number of officers and soldiers in the army is verified and issued to reduce expenditures. (F) Increasing construction costs, although the percentage in the total budget is too small, the total amount cannot be increased again, that is, it should be evenly distributed with other expenses. Also, Wu's opinions will be discussed with Fan on the 15th, and then drafted. The Standing Committee of the Senate will adjourn on the 15th and continue the meeting on the 16th, and the opinion letter can be passed.</p>

The Lord and his wife then drove to Ambassador Steve's official residence to rest, and immediately met with reporters from this newspaper. He was in very good health and talked to the old Chinese employee of the embassy who was familiar with the history in detail, and occasionally tried to talk in Chinese.

Lord Killearn firmly denied that his trip was related to negotiations on the Kowloon incident. However, according to what the reporter learned, he is straightforward and has always been friendly to China. Although he came to China at the invitation of Ambassador Steve to revisit his "second hometown," if the ambassador discusses the unpleasant incident between China and Britain with him during his two-day stay in Beijing, his opinions will definitely help the smooth progress of the negotiations. After the Lord and Lady Killearn finished talking, they took a photo in front of the official residence at the request of the reporter, and signed it for this newspaper as a souvenir.</p>

Since January 1947, the required funds have been changed to be borne by the central government, provinces, and counties according to the percentage of the field tax grain obtained. Because the field tax for 1947 continued to be handled by levying in kind and lending, and the provinces and counties were unable to share the expenses, the required funds were fully funded by the central government again since July 1, 1947, but the county-level agencies are still subordinate to various county governments and have not been independent.</p>

In this battle, the Communist bandits lost more than seven battalions. National Army Major General Li Mingding, the unit commander, died in action. Since the 11th, Nie Rongzhen launched the main force of three columns, fiercely attacking Laishui. A certain National Army commander personally led two units, rushing to reinforce along two routes, advancing to two kilometers east of Laishui, completely annihilating a regiment of Communist bandits attacking the Juma River bridge. Another unit annihilated four battalions in Gaoluo. By the night of the 12th, the Communist bandits, with ten brigades, again attacked Gaoluo and Beiyi'an (both between Laishui and Gaobeidian) to attack the reinforcements. Two regiments of the National Army in Beiyi'an, under the command of Unit Commander Li Mingding, defended the area for two days and nights.

<h3>The Deterioration of the Kowloon City Incident — The Attitude We Should Adopt for Universal Discussion</h3>
<p>The Kowloon City incident has suddenly deteriorated, resulting in a bloody tragedy. The Chinese people are universally indignant, and students in Beijing, Shanghai, and other places are reportedly planning to strike and demonstrate. We deeply regret this development of the incident. Now that the situation continues to evolve, the first thing we must point out is that, no matter how this incident evolves, we must overcome emotion with reason. Looking at the developments of the past few days, we have seen that, on the part of our government, Foreign Minister Wang first summoned British Ambassador Stevenson to the Foreign Ministry on the 12th, sternly demanding that the London government immediately instruct the Governor of Hong Kong to cease all coercive actions in Kowloon City during this negotiation period and to no longer send police into the city. On the 8th, a written protest was submitted to the British Ambassador. After the Hong Kong government continued to send armed police into Kowloon City and incidents of injury to Chinese people occurred, the Guangdong Provincial Government immediately passed a resolution allocating 500 million yuan to assist the suffering residents of Kowloon City and dispatched Provincial Committee member Xiao Ciyin to Kowloon City with funds to express condolences. On the Hong Kong government's side, armed police were sent into the city to forcibly demolish houses, and gunfire resulted in a bloody incident. Its court even sentenced Kowloon City residents who resisted relocation to imprisonment, denying that the court had jurisdiction over Kowloon City. On the Kowloon City residents' side, public sentiment is high, and they are "vowing to die rather than leave" to safeguard our national sovereignty.</p>
<p>Regarding the Kowloon incident, we previously wrote an article arguing that Kowloon City itself is a place beyond the reach of the Hong Kong government's power, and even for the sake of public order, the people's livelihood should be stabilized first. The demolition of houses and forced relocation should not occur. Therefore, we hope that the British government and the Hong Kong authorities can recognize the long-term relationship between China and Britain and refrain from actions that would stimulate Chinese emotions. Now that this incident is increasingly deteriorating, we truly regret it. What we want to point out here is that the deterioration of this incident is not necessarily a reflection of the British government's policy. The main reason for the development of the incident is that the Hong Kong government has viewed it as a local incident, and in handling it, it has inevitably been too hasty. Within the Hong Kong government, there are many colonial officials who are indifferent to the emotions of the governed and are thus quite out of touch with the policies of the London government. Originally, Kowloon City is a trivial matter, and our Chinese people did not want to see this minor incident as overly serious in the current turbulent international situation, hoping that this incident could disappear without a trace. Now that the situation has developed to the current stage, our Foreign Ministry has submitted a protest to the British Ambassador. We deeply hope that the London government can quickly and effectively stop the Hong Kong government officials' atrocities and take necessary disciplinary actions against the responsible personnel of the Hong Kong government, so that this situation can be resolved. We firmly believe that the government led by Prime Minister Attlee, which has been able to implement Britain's withdrawal from India and grant independence to Burma, also has a long-term vision and will take swift and necessary measures regarding this Kowloon incident. It should be noted that Moscow is currently launching a propaganda offensive against Britain, and this Kowloon City incident is adding fuel to the fire. Prime Minister Attlee is far-sighted, and we believe that he certainly does not want this small incident to affect the overall situation.</p>
<p>What we want to point out further here is that the issue of Kowloon City is actually related to the entire issue of Hong Kong and Kowloon; even if we do not discuss the Hong Kong issue, it is also related to the entire issue of the Kowloon Leased Territory. From the perspective of Sino-British relations and the entire world situation, since Britain has withdrawn from India and granted independence to Burma, it should voluntarily return Hong Kong and Kowloon to China. In the current war situation, Britain's retention of Hong Kong and Kowloon has no strategic significance for it and may even increase its burden. What it can give Britain is perhaps only the placement of a very small number of colonial officials and some adventurers; it is unwise to allow the friendship between China and Britain to be overshadowed by such people. When Churchill was the British Prime Minister during the war, he said that he did not want to preside over the end of the British Empire; it was under this circumstance that we had the signing of the Sino-British New Treaty, which did not touch upon the issue of Hong Kong and Kowloon. The current situation is significantly different from when Churchill was in power. We believe that the Attlee government can, based on its consistent enlightened policy, make a thorough and fundamental resolution to the issue of Hong Kong and Kowloon after India and Burma. If this Kowloon City incident can lead to an overall resolution of the entire Hong Kong and Kowloon issue, then the blood shed by the residents of Kowloon City will have even more valuable significance.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the spontaneous and passionate emotions of the Chinese people caused by the Kowloon City incident symbolize the abundance of the Chinese national vitality, which is very gratifying. However, what we want to point out here is that, in this incident, our government has already allocated funds from the Guangdong Provincial Government for relief and sent personnel to express condolences; and our diplomatic authorities are currently negotiating with Britain. Our people should unite to support the government with trust and avoid the expansion of the situation. As for students in various places, moved by righteous indignation, or intending to take action, it is originally a noble expression of patriotic sentiment, worthy of general admiration. However, strikes and demonstrations may not necessarily help to resolve the incident, and neglecting studies and affecting grades are directly related losses; moreover, Moscow is planning to launch a propaganda offensive against Britain. At a time when the country is mobilizing for war, it is inevitable that there are people who betray national interests, stirring up trouble. All our citizens should restrain their emotions, restore reason, and not increase the government's difficulties; then this Kowloon City incident may be resolved quickly and satisfactorily.</p>
<p>Finally, we deeply feel compelled to say that the Kowloon City incident was also caused by the Communist bandits' deliberate attempts to create chaos after the victory. If we had not had the Communist bandits' unrest after the victory, we might have already recovered Hong Kong and Kowloon. Because of the Communist bandits' unrest, we had to mobilize to suppress the rebellion; under these circumstances, our negotiations to recover Hong Kong and Kowloon could not be smoothly carried out, and the Hong Kong colonial officials were able to intensify these atrocities. The Communist bandits are also citing external forces, and most of our Northeast is still under foreign rule. If this continues, if the Communist bandits are not eliminated, the pain of national subjugation is not difficult to imagine. Now that the Kowloon City incident is deteriorating again, we hope that the Chinese people can better recognize the Communist bandits' poisonous harm to the country and rise up together to actively participate in the suppression of the rebellion: only when the bandit disaster is quelled can the Chinese people restore their healthy development. At that time, there will never be events like the current Kowloon City incident again.</p>

<h3>Missionaries Near Communist Areas are Retreating to Hankou</h3>
<p>[Our Hankou Correspondent, 14th] After the news of the American missionary being shot and killed by bandits in central Hubei spread, the American community here was quite shocked. This morning, the reporter interviewed Pastor Hanson, the person in charge of the American Church, and Mr. Becker, the American Consul in Hankou. Pastor Han expressed to the reporter in a heavy tone that, after this incident occurred, we are not able to express any opinions, but it can be said that the general bandits intended to rob property, and they do not easily harm people, especially not American personnel. Therefore, we judged that this completely abnormal atrocity must have been orchestrated by the Communist bandits. According to Consul Baker, as of now, we have not yet received a direct detailed report on this incident, so we do not want to give a definitive comment, but the tragedy has indeed occurred, and we are now handling the aftermath. The church has notified the missionaries near the Communist areas to retreat to Zhengzhou, Laohekou, and other safe areas as soon as possible, and then transport them to Hankou by special plane for centralization. Currently, all of the church’s St. Paul No. 72 plane has already flown to Zhengzhou for the first time this morning to pick up the missionaries, and Associated Press reporter Mi Hailou went with the plane. It is scheduled to make two round trips today and can pick up more than 60 missionaries. As for the withdrawal of missionaries from Hubei, because there is no civilian airport in Laohekou, we are now seeking temporary co-use from the Chinese Air Force. Once approved, we can fly to pick them up within days. As for the remains of the three murdered missionaries, they have been transported to Hankou by church personnel and will arrive within days and will be buried in Hankou. Finally, Mr. Becker said that, if there is transportation, the consulate is prepared to go to Jingmen for an on-site investigation in order to obtain direct information.</p>
<h3>Various Places Telegraph the Central Government to Conduct Strong Negotiations with Britain; Hong Kong's Chinese Newspapers are Righteous and Forceful</h3>
<p>[Our Hankou Correspondent, 14th] The Hankou Municipal Council passed a resolution requesting the government to seriously protest the Kowloon City incident.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanchang, 14th] The Jiangxi Provincial Council held a meeting of resident committee members today, and the Kowloon City incident was discussed. It was decided to telegraph the central government to conduct serious negotiations to protect sovereignty.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Kunming, 14th] The Municipal Council is planning to ask the whole country to unanimously request the government to conduct strong negotiations on the Kowloon City incident.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Changchun, 14th] People are discussing the issue on the streets and expressing anger at the Hong Kong police for shooting and wounding our compatriots.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Taiyuan, 14th] The Journalists Association of Bing sent a telegram to the whole country, calling on the people to rise up and support the government's strong diplomacy to maintain sovereignty over Kowloon City.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Hong Kong, 13th] The Island Daily commented on the Kowloon City incident, saying that it not only failed to resettle the displaced residents based on humanitarianism but also drove them into a more painful abyss. The Xinsheng Evening News said that yesterday's incident was not a warning shot by the police but aimed at killing people. The wounded residents were directly shot into the muscles by bullets. Leaving aside the standpoint of the country and nation, and from the standpoint of Hong Kong residents, Hong Kong's rule of law and administrative measures are definitely not allowed. The English-language South China Morning Post stated that the proposal to open a Kowloon City Park will be submitted to the Legislative Council meeting in the near future.</p>
<p>[United Press, Hong Kong, 14th] It is reported that Chinese leaflets were found in Kowloon City, stating that the Hong Kong police used machine guns to cause a bloody massacre. The police station is now investigating the source. It is said that the leaflets were a report from the Kowloon City Residents Association to Chairman Chiang, Foreign Minister Wang, Chairman Song of the Guangdong Provincial Government, the National Army, Navy, Air Force, and the people.</p>
<h3>Some Northeastern Technical Personnel Decide to Transfer to Jiangnan; Will Return North After the Situation Opens Up</h3>
<p>[Our Beiping Correspondent, 14th] The National Resources Commission has recently decided to transfer senior technical personnel from the Northeast to Jiangnan in batches and has begun transportation under possible circumstances. Guo Xiangyu, manager of the Fuxin Coal Mine, recently arrived in Tanggu via Qinhuangdao by sea, accompanied by 60 technical employees. Other mining personnel are also moving south. It is reported that this measure was taken because the situation in the Northeast has not yet opened up, and most mines have stopped production. Thousands of technical personnel are trapped in that area, while the industrial development in Jiangnan urgently needs technical personnel. Therefore, this temporary measure is being taken. After the senior personnel from the various industrial and mining industries in the Northeast move south, some personnel will still be left to maintain production and manage equipment. Once the situation in the Northeast opens up, the commission will again draw personnel to go north. Sun Yueqi is currently inspecting in Hunan, planning to place the transferred personnel.</p>
<h3>Chennault Air Transport Team Will Open Ping-Shen Airlines</h3>
<p>[Our Shenyang Correspondent, 14th] Chennault Air Transport Team is scheduled to open the Ping-Shen Airlines within days and is in the process of negotiations. It is said that the first batch of passengers will be dependents of the National Resources Commission returning south. This is good news for Ping-Shen passenger and freight transportation, and China Airlines will encounter a powerful competitor.</p>
<h3>Jiangsu Province Recruiting 80,000 Soldiers; Military Meeting Opens Today</h3>
<p>[Our Zhenjiang Correspondent, 14th] The military service conference is scheduled to be held at 9:00 tomorrow morning at the Military Control District Command. Commanders of various divisions and regiments and county magistrates from both north and south of the Yangtze River have come to the province to report. It is said that the main topics of discussion at the conference are the quotas for each county and general technical issues related to conscription and delivery, new recruit management, and nutrition. How to arrange the resettlement fees for this year's conscription is expected to be a lively discussion. In addition, the conscription quota for this province is 80,000. Zhenjiang's quota is 1,742. Regarding the issue of age, it is reported that the Ministry of National Defense has recently given an explanation. The year of conscription for active-duty men of conscription age in the 37th year of the Republic (1948) is expected to be men born between 1923 and 1927, with the principle of conscripting men who have reached the age of 20. If a certain county has an inaccurate survey and fails to meet the quota due to missing men, it should extend the year to meet the quota. The above regulations were formulated in order to avoid affecting social order. If the extension is excessive, it will not only cause anxiety among the people and affect social order but also hinder the implementation of military service. Therefore, the year should be shortened as much as possible.</p>

<h3>Speakers of Pingjinji Provinces Arrive in Shanghai Together; Will Go to Nanjing to Present Important Suggestions</h3>
<p>[Our News] Liu Yaozhang, Speaker of the Ji Provisional Council, Xu Huidong, Speaker of the Ping Provisional Council, Shi Zizhou, Speaker of the Tianjin Provisional Council, Ji Dianchuan, Chairman of the Tianjin Chamber of Commerce, and industrialist Li Zhulu and four others flew from Tianjin to Shanghai yesterday afternoon at 5:00. They will go to Nanjing within days to meet with the authorities, requesting relief for the grain shortage in the north, restoration of industrial loans, and will present three important suggestions to revive the economy.</p>
<h3>Liu Yaozhang's Remarks</h3>
<p>According to Speaker Liu Yaozhang, the reporter was informed that, in terms of the grain shortage, the food in North China could not be self-sufficient before the war, and it was entirely dependent on the support of the provinces of Henan, Northeast, and Northwest. Due to the current situation, the only area that can supply food to North China is the Yangtze River basin, but because transportation cannot be on time, and the demand for military grain in Hebei is urgent, in fact, there are still local requisitions. In addition, the bandit forces are disrupting the area, and the number of refugees is increasing day by day, flocking to the city to avoid the chaos, further exacerbating the urban grain shortage. At present, the price of flour in Beiping has risen to 1.1 million yuan per small bag (approximately 37 jin). With fluctuating grain prices, the hearts of the people in the north are also fluctuating. I hope that the authorities can eliminate all restrictions on the northward transportation of grain in the future, and supply foreign flour, or exchange coal from the north for rice from the south. When distributing US relief supplies, I also hope that more consideration can be given to the needs of the north. Regarding the restoration of industrial loans, it is even more urgent for the north, because the scope of industry in the north is small, so the support is also small. At present, some industries in the north have already reduced production due to the suspension of industrial loans. After the pressure of annual rewards, it is not easy to spend the Lunar New Year. If this matter cannot be handled well, it will turn from an economic problem to an unemployment problem, and then to a security and political problem. Therefore, we have to request the government to quickly restore industrial loans. As for the supervision method, it can be discussed in detail. The above two items are urgent issues at the moment. As for the fundamental plan, there are approximately three points:  Reward the import and export industries of the north.  All factories in North China that have started work should strive to maintain it, and those that have not started work should try their best to find ways to help them start work. According to my rough estimate, less than 20% of the enemy and puppet factories taken over in North China have resumed work.  The grain production in North China should be increased as much as possible. Of the 800,000 mu of land reclaimed by the Japanese in the past, the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry is continuing to operate only one-quarter. In the five-year production increase plan of Jilin, Hebei is not included in the first two years, which is really incomprehensible. I hope it can be revised. Regarding the overall situation in North China, Mr. Liu stated that, first of all, he hopes that Chairman Chu Xichun can come to Beiping to take office as soon as possible. In today's northern situation, the provincial government cannot be without a leader for a day. After the establishment of the North China Bandit Suppression Headquarters, it can achieve unified command and flexible use of troops. If it can be coordinated with the establishment of local people's armed forces, the overall situation in the north can still be optimistic.</p>
<h3>The Silver Market in Changsha is Extremely Tight, and Stores are Hoping to Close Down</h3>
<p>[Our Changsha Correspondent, 14th] The exchange rate of Chang-Sui has increased, and a large amount of Hunan cash has flowed out, resulting in an extremely tight silver market in Changsha. More than a dozen stores have closed down in the past two days, with some owing up to 20 billion yuan.</p>
<h3>The Jiangsu Provincial Government Telegraphs Orders to All Counties to Find Ways to Stabilize Grain Prices</h3>
<p>[Our Zhenjiang Correspondent, 14th] Recently, the Jiangsu Provincial Government, due to the sharp increase in rice and grain prices to around 300,000 yuan per stone, and the increase in flour prices to around 100,000 yuan per bag, as well as the gradual rise in firewood, oil, salt, rice, and other items, affecting the lives of ordinary people, is very concerned. A telegram order has been issued to all county and municipal governments to find ways to stabilize prices before the end of the lunar year to stabilize people's livelihoods and social order.</p>

<h3>The National Army Holds the Initiative on All Battlefields - Deng Wenyi Reports on the Week's Military Situation</h3>
<p>[Dispatch from this Newspaper, Nanjing, 14th] Deng Wenyi, Director of the News Bureau of the Ministry of National Defense, reported on the week's military situation from January 8th to 14th of the 37th year of the Republic at a press conference on the 14th, stating:</p>
<p>Over the past week, the communist bandits in the Northeast attempted to steal Shenyang but suffered another defeat. Initially, the bandits concentrated a superior force in the area east of Gongzhuling in the Northwest and between Faku, attempting to strike the National Army and then threaten Shenyang. Although one division of the National Army suffered some losses in equipment, the National Army launched a multi-pronged offensive, encircling the bandits. Since the 8th, they have defeated the Lin Biao bandit's 1st, 2nd, 4th, 6th, and 10th columns on both sides of the Liao River and near Faku, completely annihilating the 35th, 34th, and 36th regiments of the bandit's 4th column. The bandits, unable to withstand the pressure, fled west and north in a panic. The situation west of Shenyang has stabilized.</p>
<p>In North China, after the National Army forces on the Pingbao Line joined forces, they again defeated the bandit's 3rd and 6th columns near Yaocun on the 9th, dispersing a force of more than five regiments and capturing more than 5,000 bandits. On the 10th, a unit of the National Army completely annihilated the 33rd Regiment of the 11th Brigade of the bandit's 3rd Column south of Dingxing. Since then, the National Army has been sweeping the area around Mancheng outside Baoding, and the Baoding garrison has also launched a brave counterattack. On the 11th, they routed approximately six regiments of the Nie Rongzhen bandit's 2nd, 4th, and 6th columns southeast of Mancheng, who fled in disarray into the mountains southwest of Mancheng, tending to disperse into smaller units. The battle on the Pingbao front is now in the mopping-up phase.</p>
<p>While the bandits were being forced to suppress on the Pinghan Line, the bandits in the Bohai Military Region and the coastal defense detachment gathered more than 4,000 bandits to launch a diversionary battle in the Xiaozhan area east of Tianjin, in order to alleviate the pressure on the Hebei-Henan-Shandong-Jiangsu 4th bandit army and threaten Tanggu. However, the National Army in that area, cooperating with a part of the local militia, swept the bandits, and recovered Xiaozhan on the morning of the 11th. The situation in that area has returned to stability.</p>
<p>The Liu Bocheng bandit troops in the Henan-Hubei-Anhui area were forced to flee in various directions due to the National Army's pressure from all sides, sometimes eastward and sometimes westward. Unable to escape the National Army's encirclement and suppression, they were also frequently ambushed by local militias, suffering from hunger, cold, heavy casualties. The 1st Column generally fled to Linruji, while the main force was at Baoxinji. The 2nd Column had crossed Xuanhuadian and fled west. The 3rd Column was fleeing in the area of Shijiaqiao, Yuexi, and Huangniushan. The 6th Column's main force was still dodging encirclement near Lishan. The remnants of the 10th Column were near Xinye, joining forces with the Chen Geng bandit troops, intending to besiege the militia of Deng County. Our Neixiang militia has gone to reinforce them. It is expected that the bandits will still have to flee. The 62nd Column, entrenched near the Dahong Mountains, fled to the vicinity of Suixian, while another group of more than 1,000 fled north of Zhongxiang, crossed the Xiang River, and fled to Hujiaji. The National Army is dividing its forces to pursue and suppress them.</p>
<p>The Chen Yi bandit's 8th, 10th, and 11th Columns in the Jiangsu-Shandong-Henan area, after failing in the battle of Heze, are currently scattered in the areas of Suixian, Ningling, and Liuhe south of the Longhai Railway. Their 1st, 3rd, 4th, and 6th Columns are fleeing northeastward to the Taikang area, attempting to join forces with the bandits in the north. There are no major battles at present.</p>
<p>In southern Shanxi, the troops moving south from Taiyuan have successively recovered Huoxian, Zhaocheng, and Hongdong. After joining forces in Linfen, the elite National Army troops moving north began to advance towards Yuncheng from the east, west, and south on the 9th. They recovered Jiexian on the 10th and advanced north in victory, sweeping all before them. They recovered Yuncheng on the afternoon of the 12th. The two brigades of bandit troops defending the city were completely defeated. The bandits who escaped outside the city fled north in panic. The bandits' dream of occupying Yuncheng with six brigades of troops vanished in less than a month, and they sacrificed more than 10,000 troops. Following the victories after the New Year, there will be continuous victories. This has proven that the Chinese people's rise and the National Army's offensive have seized the initiative on the battlefield.</p>

<h3>Truman Proposes Ten-Year Prosperity Plan to Prevent Economic Panic - Anti-Inflation Bill Should be Passed</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 14th] President Truman stated in a report to Congress on the domestic economy that unless a tough anti-inflation bill is quickly implemented, the United States will face a severe recession. The increase in prices, wages, and profits in 1947 has become a step in the development of inflation and has caused serious difficulties and become a serious economic threat. Truman also predicted in the report that if Congress can pass a tough anti-inflation plan, then the production of the United States can still be improved and achieve general concrete prosperity. He said that the depletion of American family savings last year was an ominous sign. Truman's report stated that the employment performance of the people last year was very good. There were 60 million employed in June, and the annual average was 58 million. The unemployed were only 1.6% in November and December. If we hope that all the people in the country can be fully employed, then we need to add 700,000 new jobs. The number of jobs needed nationwide in the United States within ten years should be 64 million. After reviewing the economic situation last year, President Truman put forward detailed suggestions for 1948, implementing his ten-year prosperity plan. Finally, he issued a warning: regardless of whether it will affect inflation, the Marshall Plan must be implemented, otherwise the direct impact on various countries and the indirect impact on the United States will be unimaginable.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 13th] President Truman stated in his annual economic report to Congress that the primary economic goal of this year is to curb the trend of inflation. The second goal of 1948 is to add 700,000 people to the labor force, increasing the number of employed people to 59 million, and increasing the total amount of goods and services, making it 3% more than the total value of goods and services in 1947, which was 226 billion US dollars. Mr. Truman stated that the United States' long-term economic plan should focus on three major areas: implementing a savings plan to protect and develop America's natural resources and capital, while expanding industrial equipment, transportation, and housing; developing human resources and productivity, expanding employment to a maximum of 64 million people in the next ten years, and providing everyone with greater opportunities in education, while establishing welfare institutions such as health insurance and social security throughout society; developing a highly productive economy, the implementation method of which is to eliminate monopolistic facilities and expand consumers' income through an active competition system to facilitate the distribution of goods, and adopt certain policies on agricultural taxation, debt management, and world trade.</p>
<h3>British and French Finance Ministers Meet Regularly to Discuss Economic and Financial Matters - Preparatory Meeting of Sixteen Nations Conference Postponed</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 13th] It was officially announced here that French Finance Minister Mayer is scheduled to come to London next Thursday or Friday to meet with Chancellor of the Exchequer Cripps to conduct a general review of economic and financial issues between Britain and France. The exchange rate between the sterling area and the franc area, as well as the exchange rate between the sterling/franc area and other countries, is also on the agenda. Observers believe that the talks between Cripps and Mayer will focus on matters related to the British and French economies. However, since Britain and France are the convening countries of the European Sixteen Nations Economic Cooperation Conference, the economic or financial resolutions they make and the future trends of the Sixteen Nations Conference may also cause repercussions.

<p>[United Press, Washington, 14th] Treasury Secretary Snyder today strongly opposed the request for the sixteen European nations to use their deposits in the United States to help offset the costs required for the Marshall Plan for aid and reconstruction in Europe before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. It is said that as of the end of last June, the private deposits of various countries in the United States amounted to approximately 4.8 billion US dollars, which is insufficient to meet the needs of protecting the stability of the currencies of various countries.

In addition to 25% of the ship price that must be paid immediately, the remaining price will be paid in installments over several years. He also pointed out that the proportional allocation of world ship tonnage is conducive to the balance of world trade, and therefore is extremely beneficial to the establishment of peace.</p>

The British side has expressed its deep approval of this move. After the opening of this airbase, it will be of great benefit to the US military's supplies in the Mediterranean region.

<h3>Aviation Policy Committee Recommends that the United States Strengthen its Air Defense to Cope with Future Atomic and Bacterial Warfare</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 13th] President Truman previously appointed five experts to organize the Aviation Policy Committee to study the situation of the US Air Force. The committee issued a report today stating that by January 1, 1953, the United States will face an atomic day, at which time some foreign countries can almost certainly hold a large number of atomic weapons and may be able to mass produce long-range rockets. The committee advocated establishing a large bomber fleet, equipped with long-range rockets, to warn those who attempt to attack the United States, and tell them that if they attack the United States, their factories, cities, and war institutions will be destroyed.</p>
<p>The report advocated a radical reform of the United States' traditional strategic strategy in peacetime and proposed: advocating the completion of 7,000 front-line aircraft for the US Air Force by January 1, 1952, supplemented by 3,212 border defense aircraft and a reserve fleet of 8,100 aircraft; not assuming that other countries will not be able to mass produce atomic weapons by the end of 1952; not assuming that other countries will not be able to mass produce rockets with a range of 5,000 miles that can attack entire cities by the end of 1952; plans to prevent bacterial warfare must be stepped up. The report also said that research in atomic, bacterial, supersonic, and other fields, as well as the development of a suitable air force, must go hand in hand. The latter must be the basic tool of future national defense. The report divided the future into two stages: one is the current stage, which assumes that the United States continues to exclusively possess the secret of the atomic bomb; the other is that other countries have a large number of atomic weapons to attack the United States. In the first stage, the United States must continue to prepare for war before the disputes between the East and the West are resolved. In the second stage, the United States must have strong defensive equipment to reduce the effectiveness of enemy attacks to a minimum, and have a strong counter-attack force to immediately retaliate and occupy outpost strongholds to reduce the danger to the US mainland. Regarding funding, the committee advocated increasing the existing military budget of 10.98 billion US dollars to 11.59 billion US dollars in 1948, and to 13.2 billion US dollars in 1949.</p>
<h3>Japanese Government Purges Hirano - Katayama Cabinet Gets a Breather - Liberal Party's Activities Will Be Hit</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 13th] The Japanese Central Screening Committee suddenly changed its attitude in an unexpected action today, and voted to purge former Minister of Agriculture and Forestry Hirano Rikizo based on new evidence. This evidence shows that Hirano Rikizo is a member of the notorious radical nationalist organization "Tenkan Hiraki Renmei" (League to Open the Heavenly Gate). The purge of Hirano can give the Katayama government some guarantees to extend its term, and is a blow to the hopes of the Liberal Party. The "Tenkan Hiraki Renmei" was organized by Mitsui Sakichi, the lawyer who defended the naval officers implicated in the May 15th Incident. He is a leader of right-wing figures, and Hirano is one of the small group of members who have joined the organization.</p>
<p>[United Press, Tokyo, 14th] Japanese Minister of Justice Suzuki said: As far as the signs of Japanese purged persons destroying the instructions of the Allied Headquarters are concerned, these purged persons are still engaging in behind-the-scenes political activities. All will be severely punished. This warning was issued after the Central Screening Committee purged former Minister of Agriculture and Forestry Hirano on the night of the 13th. Hirano's departure from the Socialist Party was only last week. He said: He will lead a new political party to overthrow the Katayama Cabinet. Prime Minister Katayama dismissed Hirano last November on the grounds that he failed to cooperate with the cabinet. The increasingly serious dispute between Katayama and Hirano caused Hirano and fifteen other Socialist Party Diet members to leave the party last week, planning to form a new party with the intention of overthrowing the Katayama cabinet. Some observers interpreted Suzuki's warning as being directed directly at Hirano and his supporters. Japanese observers unanimously concluded that Hirano's purge has relieved the Katayama cabinet of its difficulties at the beginning of the parliamentary reconvening on January 21. After Hirano was purged, he lost his position as a member of the Diet.</p>
<h3>Katayama Submits Amendment to Election Law to Cabinet</h3>

<h3>A Disturbance at the French Parliament: Herriot Re-elected as Speaker</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Paris, 13th] Radical Party member Herriot was re-elected as Speaker of the National Assembly today with 317 votes. The other candidate, Communist Party member Cara, received 174 votes and was defeated. After the announcement of the election results, the National Assembly declared a recess, and the parliamentary groups of each party convened separately to nominate candidates for Deputy Speakers. The leaders of each party's parliamentary group then passed the following list of Deputy Speakers, which was submitted to the National Assembly for a vote: First Deputy Speaker: Le Roux of the Socialist Party; Second Deputy Speaker: Béroule of the People's Republican Party; Third Deputy Speaker: Duclos of the Communist Party. According to an agreement reached a year ago between the parties, the First Deputy Speaker of the National Assembly should be from the largest party in the parliament, i.e., the Communist Party. Today's list violated this agreement, so Duclos stated in the lounge that the Communist Party would refuse to hold office in the parliament to protest. Three hours later, the parliament reconvened, with Garcin, the oldest Communist Party member, as chairman. He announced that the leaders of the parliamentary groups had failed to reach an agreement on the nomination of Deputy Speakers, and that he had informed the President of the Republic of this matter. Before the President provides a response, the parliament will be adjourned until 2:00 PM tomorrow. Upon hearing this, most of the Communist Party members left the chamber. The remaining members smoked or discussed the incident loudly, and the chamber was in great disorder. Right-wing and centrist members shouted, "Go to Moscow!" Communist members responded with harsh words. Some right-wing members shouted for Vivollet, the Radical Party member who was next in age to Garcin, to take the chairman's seat. As Vivollet was about to take the seat, he was blocked by more than twenty Communist members. The chamber staff then advised the journalists in the audience to leave, and the lights in the chamber were gradually turned off, but the noise inside could still be heard intermittently.</p>

<h3>International Gold and Dollar Smuggling Ring Broken Up: Sixteen Key Suspects Arrested, Gold Bars Flown in from Mexico, Underground Hong Kong Exchange Handling Billions Daily</h3>
<p>[Special Report] The Municipal Police Bureau yesterday cracked down on an international gold and dollar black market organization. The person in charge was a Russian named Maddox, manager of Maddox &amp; Co. at 24 Central Road. Additionally, the foreign national involved in the black market and Xue Lianhuang, manager of Jian'an Bank, were arrested on the fifth floor of Jialing Building on Sichuan Road and at No. 27, Dongxing Lane. Thirteen other people were also arrested, including two White Russians and the rest were Chinese citizens. Over 220 taels of gold, more than $300 in US currency, and over 250 million in legal tender notes were seized.</p>
<p>The organization was divided into two parts. One part was responsible for international relations and acted as a representative selling gold and dollars, with Liao Quanqi as the chief representative. Liao's office was located in a room on the fifth floor of the Jialing Building at the intersection of Sichuan Road and Nanjing Road. The second part was the storage location for gold and dollars, located at Jian'an Bank, No. 27, Dongxing Lane, managed by Xue Lianhuang. The warehouse was located at No. 16 in the same lane. Jian'an Bank was also a well-known Hong Kong exchange dealer, with daily transactions exceeding 100 billion. The source of the gold and dollars sold by the organization was also arranged by Jian'an Bank sending secret telegrams to foreign countries. The sales agency for gold and dollars was Maddox &amp; Co., managed by Maddox.</p>
<p>According to investigations, the gold sold by the organization was produced in Mexico and flown to Shanghai by plane. After the gold arrived in Shanghai, Liao would deposit it at Jian'an Bank, and then Maddox &amp; Co. would sell it.</p>
<p>After the financial management and economic inspection authorities became aware of the situation, at 10:00 AM on the 14th, police officers disguised as customers went to Maddox &amp; Co. to purchase gold bars, issuing two checks. One check was for 1,818,500,000 yuan to purchase 17 large gold bars, and the other was for 1,680,000,000 yuan to purchase 16 large gold bars. Maddox &amp; Co. believed them and Liao Quanqi delivered the goods. The police officers then followed Liao to the Jialing Building to pick up the goods. At the same time, other police officers who had been waiting locked down Maddox &amp; Co., cutting off external communication, and searched the premises for five hours, obtaining a great deal of evidence. Maddox was arrested on the spot and a check for 18,000,000 yuan, obtained from the sale of US dollars, was found on his person. He confessed that Maddox &amp; Co.'s business was import and export, and sometimes they did stock trading. In 1946, they had dealt with gold and dollars. He also revealed that a foreign friend was running the gold and dollar black market, using the company to "launder money."</p>
<p>The police officers also detained a White Russian woman named Yavofumi, who claimed to be from Jilin Province in Northeastern China and lived at No. 902, Lane 265, Changle Road, working as a tailor and a friend of Maddox's wife. 263 US dollars and 25 cents were found on her person. She claimed that the money belonged to her American friend. Another White Russian, Xue Aofu, and Chinese citizens Zhao Zhishen, Qiu Xiankun, and Huang Fuhan were also arrested. Checks and cash totaling 250,068,000 yuan were found on Huang Fuhan's person. All were suspected of serious crimes and taken into custody for further investigation.</p>
<p>Liao Quanqi in the Jialing Building was unaware of what had happened at Maddox &amp; Co. Liao first handed over 16 large gold bars to the police officers disguised as customers, and then called Jian'an Bank to send someone to deliver the remaining goods. After waiting for a long time, a Jian'an Bank employee named Ma Weiheng arrived and said that some of the checks needed to be exchanged for cashier's checks. The police officers took him up on his offer, and one of them accompanied Ma Weiheng outside, where he was arrested and taken into custody.</p>
<p>In the Jialing Building, the police officers disguised as customers had a very pleasant conversation with Liao Quanqi. Soon after, two other Jian'an Bank employees, Ye Jinyuan and Ye Defa, arrived with four and a half large gold bars. Including the previous delivery, a total of twenty and a half gold bars had been delivered, still twelve and a half short of the required amount. They agreed to go to Jian'an Bank to pick up the remaining goods. The four of them took two three-wheeled military vehicles to Jian'an Bank. Plainclothes police officers followed and set up a dragnet around the area. At Jian'an Bank, they handed over another gold bar. They said that the remaining goods still needed to be obtained from another location. After waiting for a long time without any news, the investigators, fearing that the news would leak out, revealed their true identities and arrested all the suspects. In addition to Liao Quanqi, Ye Jinyuan, and Ye Defa, the police arrested Xue Lianhuang, manager of Jian'an Bank, Lin Shangbai, an employee (whose person contained a code book for gold and dollar transactions), Tang Jinshui (whose person contained 115 US dollars and a gold pendant), Zhong Jinding (whose diaries contained records of gold and dollar transactions), and Yang Jiqian and Chen Dong, whose persons contained important account books and receipts for foreign exchange and domestic remittances. Later, the police went to No. 16, Baoxing Lane, to search the warehouse and found another large gold bar (for a total of 22 and a half bars). Ma Xianglin, the person in charge of guarding the warehouse, had already fled and was not apprehended.</p>

<h3>Five-Year-Old Girl a Thief: Three Generations of Skill, Major Theft Case Solved in Nanjing, Mastermind Mother and Daughter Fled to Hong Kong</h3>
<p>[Special Report, Nanjing, 14th] The case of the theft of a seven-carat diamond ring from a patron named Gu at the Shanghai Guotai Yue Opera Theater on November 27 of last year has been solved in Nanjing on the 13th. After the case occurred in Shanghai, more than 40 suspects were arrested, and it was learned that it was committed by a theft gang led by Xu Di. However, at that time, the Xu gang had dispersed and fled. Among them, Da Guiying and others came to Nanjing via Suzhou and Wuxi. The Shanghai Police Bureau had sent many people to Nanjing to contact and investigate with the Capital Northern District Police Bureau. At noon on the 13th, the Northern District Police Bureau found a suspicious woman in a public bus heading south on Shanxi Road. They followed her closely after she got off the bus at Xinjiekou, and soon arrested her while she was committing another theft, revealing the truth about the Shanghai theft case. According to her confession, the thief in the case was Xu Di's five-year-old daughter, Mao Mao. Initially, Ms. Gu's large ring on her finger was eye-catching, and they began to follow her after Ms. Gu finished her dinner somewhere. When they arrived at the Guotai Yue Opera Theater, Xu Di held Mao Mao and sat next to Ms. Gu in the empty seat left by a friend, and said that if someone came, she would return to the back row. At that time, there was still an empty seat between Xu Di's mother and daughter and Ms. Gu. After a while, Ms. Xu said she was tired, so she had Mao Mao sit in the empty seat next to Ms. Gu. Soon, Mao Mao stole the large diamond ring from Ms. Gu's finger and put it in her purse. Mao Mao's grandfather and two generations were all habitual thieves, and with the teaching of her mother, her technique was light and skillful, and Ms. Gu did not notice it. A few minutes after Mao Mao got the diamond, she said she needed to go to the bathroom urgently. Xu Di deliberately told her the direction of the toilet and asked Mao Mao to go by herself. Mao Mao did not return for a long time after she left, so Xu Di pretended to be anxious and left, falsely claiming to be looking for her daughter. And Ms. Gu did not realize that the ring was stolen until she wanted to put the ring back on after the theater was over. According to Da Guiying's confession, Xu Di has taken Mao Mao to Hong Kong in order to sell the diamond ring. After the Beijing Northern District Police Bureau solved the case, each branch of the Shanghai Police Bureau went to pick up the people. The Northern District Police Bureau handed over the case to the New City Branch Bureau, which was under its jurisdiction, and detectives from the New City Branch Bureau escorted Da Guiying to Shanghai by express train in the afternoon of the 14th.</p>
<h3>True and False Wife Case: District Prosecutor's Office Indicts Three Defendants, Forging Certificates to Obtain Travel Expenses, Violating the Regulations on Punishing Corruption</h3>
<p>[Special Report] The case of Xie Jiashu, the person in charge of the Chinese Consulate in San Francisco, Xu Liangyi, the director of the Shanghai City Bank Nanshi Office, and Xu's wife Gao Qinqiu, who were accused of corruption, has been prosecuted by the District Prosecutor's Office. The indictment stated that Xie Jiashu and Xu's wife Gao Qinqiu became acquainted while working in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Chongqing. In March of the 35th year of the Republic of China, Xie was appointed as the person in charge of the consulate in San Francisco. Before going abroad, they colluded with each other, and Gao falsely divorced her husband Xu Liangyi. Xu knew that this fact was false, and because he was living with another woman at the time, his wife Gao Qinqiu interfered, so he also falsely claimed that both parties had divorced. Xie and Gao then forged marriage certificates and other documents, and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs approved the travel expenses for family members of diplomatic officials, totaling US$862. Soon after Xie Jiashu left the country for the United States, Gao and her husband Xu Liangyi came to Shanghai from Chongqing and lived together in one place. The accuser, Li Rongni, filed a complaint with the District Prosecutor's Office. After investigation by the District Prosecutor's Office, the defendants Xie Jiashu, Gao Qinqiu, and Xu Liangyi were found to have committed crimes under Article 1, Paragraph 1, and Article 3, Item 7 of the Regulations on Punishing Corruption. The defendant Xu Liangyi should be punished in accordance with Article 30, Paragraph 1 of the Criminal Law, and a public prosecution was filed in accordance with Article 230, Paragraph 1 of the Criminal Procedure Law.</p>
<h3>Huang Xing Road Bridge: Discovery of Wasteland Body; Homicide Case Solved; Generational Feud Resolved and Rekindled; Fishmonger's Tragic Murder in Shanghai; Six Suspects, Male and Female, Apprehended</h3>
<p>[Report from this Newspaper] On the morning of the 15th of last month, the Xinshi Street Police Precinct discovered a male corpse on a wasteland near the Huang Xing Road bridge. The victim's hands were tied behind his back, and his head had multiple knife wounds, almost severed. The police station immediately reported the case to the Police Headquarters, and Chief Detective Hou urgently dispatched Squad Leader Zhu Mengwei, Deputy Squad Leader Chen Xianrong, Ma Feimu, and officers Liu Yuliang and Xu Youyi, along with photographers Shen Zhijian and Fang Meifa, to investigate. A paper identity card was found on the deceased, bearing the name Zhang Xi'an, thirty-three years old, from Huaian. Two cards were also found with the address "No. 2 Jiangnan, Zhongshan South Road, Sixteen Pu; Shui Ji Fish and Crab Shop, Yan Zuxiang." An investigation at Yan's establishment revealed that the deceased was indeed Zhang Xi'an, who had recently arrived from his hometown to sell carp in Shanghai, entrusting the shop to handle the sales. His Shanghai residence was No. 75 Chaomi Bang, Gonghe New Road. Based on these leads, the police successively detained three suspects: Zhang Shikuan, Zhang Wangzhu, and Zhang Mingjin. However, after interrogation, the cause of Zhang's death and the names of the murderers remained unknown. At that time, the chief, considering the</p>
<p>Gruesome Circumstances</p>
<p>of the murder, determined that the case was definitely not an ordinary revenge killing. Besides sending the arrested suspects to the District Procuratorate for investigation, Chief Zhu was ordered to lead his entire squad to continue the investigation. After more than twenty days of intensive inquiries, which extended to various places between Nanjing and Shanghai, the whole case began to unravel at the beginning of this month, revealing that it was caused by a generational feud and a cycle of revenge. Apart from the main perpetrators, Li Bingzhen, Li Shanshan, and Li Xueke, who are still at large, six other suspects have been apprehended (see picture): Ma Hongsheng, and accomplices Zhang Shaoyun, Liu Desan, Sun Xiong, Li Tongcai, and Ma Qishi. As of yesterday, the investigation concluded and it was determined that today the case would be</p>
<p>Charged as Murder</p>
<p>and transferred to the District Procuratorate for further processing. Yesterday at 10:00 AM, the suspects were transported to the scene in a "Flying Fortress" to reenact the crime. Sun Yuanfang, Director of the Criminal Division of the Police Bureau, forensic examiners Liang Hanfen and Zhao Xianzhang, and Chief Detective Hou were also present, and Fang Meifa from the photography division photographed the circumstances of the murder. It turns out that the deceased, Zhang Xi'an (see picture), was the current head of the Hometown Defense Team in Wangqiao Township, Huaian. He was normally a capable person, but the neighboring Gao and Li clans had a longstanding feud. The number of mutual killings over the generations was countless. When Zhang was in charge, after much persuasion, both sides</p>
<p>Ended the Feud</p>
<p>and Zhang Xi'an adopted Li Bingmei's (the deceased former husband of Ma Qishi) son from the Li clan, hoping that the two clans would live in harmony forever. Unexpectedly, Li Bingmei was brutally murdered by communists last year. Afterward, the Li clan accused Zhang of deliberately provoking the incident and using the communists to kill Li Bingmei, thus reigniting the hatred. Not long after, the township head Gao Debiao and deputy township head Li Xueke gathered clansmen like Li Hua and provided them with firearms, instigating them to rob, and</p>
<p>Framing Zhang</p>
<p>by claiming that the firearms were provided by Zhang's Hometown Defense Team. Unexpectedly, Li Hua was arrested shortly after and confessed the whole story. Zhang, in order to prove his innocence, announced the details publicly, forcing Gao and Li to flee their hometown and seek refuge in Nanjing. Due to financial difficulties, they made a living pulling rickshaws in Nanjing. However, their determination to kill Zhang had already taken root, and the Lis secretly sought out fellow villagers in Nanjing who had a longstanding feud with Zhang's clan, so that they could join forces. Soon, a man named Li Bingzhen claimed that two of his brothers had also been killed by Zhang and was willing to join the</p>
<p>Common Cause.</p>
<p>At that time, Li Xuexuan, due to physical reasons, left Nanjing for Shanghai and stayed at Zhang Yuncheng's residence at No. 75 Chaomi Bang, Gonghe New Road. On the 9th of last month, Zhang Xi'an brought six loads of lotus carp and dozens of catties of vermicelli to Shanghai for sale. On the same day, he stayed in the house of his nephew, Zhang Wanchun, across from Zhang Liancheng's house. Li, seeing a rare opportunity, immediately sent a letter to Nanjing at night, notifying Li Bingzhen and urging him to come to Shanghai to seek revenge. After receiving the letter, Li invited a clansman, Li Chongshan, and rushed to Shanghai on the 13th, first going to Ma Qishi's house in Hongzhen for a secret meeting, encouraging Ma to</p>
<p>Avenge Her Late Husband.</p>
<p>Through Ma Qishi's lover, Ma Hongsheng, they managed to hire three accomplices, Zhang Shaoyun, Sun Xiong, and Liu Desan, for six million yuan. On the evening of the 14th, while Zhang Yuncheng was inviting Zhang to dinner, they bought a bull-ear knife at Zhang Xiaoquan Scissors Shop at No. 2223 Tongbei Road, and then hired a car with license plate No. 220144 at Jinli Car Rental Shop at No. 1182 Daming Road. They dragged Zhang out, pushed him into the car, and drove west. During the journey, they</p>
<p>Tied His Hands Behind His Back</p>
<p>with a straw rope. When they arrived at the Huang Xing Road bridge, they asked the driver to stop, paid him the fare, and then Li Bingzhen, Ma Hongsheng, and others took action. They first stabbed Zhang's neck with the sharp knife. After he fell to the ground, they stabbed him several more times, attempting to sever his head. At that time, Zhang Shaoyun, Liu Desan, and Sun Xiong were terrified and fled. Li and the others stopped their actions, threw the murder weapon into a nearby stream, buried it in the mud, and then fled. The police are currently</p>
<p>Pursuing the Main Perpetrators, who are still at large.</p>

<h3>Unblocking Water Transport, Facilitating Grain Supply; Suzhou Creek Implements One-Way Traffic System for Vessels</h3>
<p>[Report from this Newspaper] Mayor Wu, concerned that the narrowness of Suzhou Creek and the large number of vessels passing through frequently caused congestion during the winter low-water season, severely affecting the grain supply, personally instructed the Social Affairs Bureau and the Police Bureau to dredge the creek to facilitate grain transport. Yesterday at noon, Ji Ming, Section Chief of the Food Department of the Social Affairs Bureau, Wu Kexiao, Chief of the Water Police Precinct, Huang Jiaju, Specialist of the Municipal Government, and Mi Shang, grain merchant Cha Baoshan, conducted an on-site survey of the congested areas around Beixinjing, Zhuzhai, and Huangdu. Seeing over a thousand vessels vying to enter and exit, causing severe congestion, they decided to implement a one-way traffic system for water transport on Suzhou Creek. During incoming tide, vessels are only allowed to enter; during outgoing tide, vessels are only allowed to exit; during slack tide, the period is for preparation. Such orderly entry and exit can reduce congestion. The group returned to Shanghai at 4:00 PM.</p>
<h3>"Miss Shanghai" Suffers Mental Anguish; Unable to Bear His Way of "Loving"; Also for a Miss Zhang, a Dance Hostess; Affectionate but Separated by a Great Divide</h3>
<p>[Report from this Newspaper] "Miss Shanghai" Xie Jiahua has returned to Shanghai from Hong Kong. She flew from Shanghai to Hong Kong on July 2nd last year to film a movie for Great China Film Company. It is said that the film contract was signed before her marriage. Later, Xie met and married Rong Meishen in less than two months. She didn't have time to mention this matter to Rong. After their marriage, Rong was very strict with Xie, causing friction in the family. He also stopped Xie's filming plan. Because of her passion for film, she resolutely left without saying goodbye. On December 3rd, Rong tracked her to Hong Kong and asked friends to Xie to the Repulse Bay Hotel, ordering Xie to return to Shanghai immediately. Xie argued that she had to compensate the film company for the losses stipulated in the contract. Rong demanded that she return to Shanghai first. During the argument, Rong suddenly pushed Xie down, tightly gripping her throat, and said, "I love you! I love you to death!" Xie, seeing this scene as if it were from a horror movie, screamed frantically. At that time, representatives from Great China Film Company came to pick Xie up for filming and wanted to call the police, but Xie stopped them.</p>
<p>The news spread to Shanghai, and Xie's mother, in a state of panic, rushed to Hong Kong on the 5th, intending to argue with Rong. Seeing the stalemate, Rong, to avoid embarrassment in a foreign land, did not meet with Xie's mother and flew back to Shanghai on the same day. Great China invited Xie to star in the film "Miss Shanghai," which was then completely rewritten, using the Repulse Bay incident as a basis. The title was changed to "Scandal," and Xie herself told the story. Filming was completed by the end of December.</p>
<p>After marrying Rong, Xie rejected social engagements. She said that during her stay in Hong Kong, apart from filming, she did not attend any banquets, hoping to please Rong and pledge eternal love. However, Rong was involved with a Miss Zhang, a dance hostess, and bought a new house for her. After suffering this mental stimulation, she decided to go to Hong Kong. At the time, there were rumors that she had eloped, but Xie said, "With my current status and the title of Miss Shanghai, I don't need to seek any more false fame and wealth. Going to Hong Kong to film was partly because of my love for film art, but it was also because I was too mentally distressed. The fact that I left Shanghai without saying goodbye also proves that Mr. Rong was not staying home every night, otherwise, I could have discussed everything with him."</p>
<p>When Xie returned to Shanghai from Hong Kong the other day, Rong and Xie's cousin, Xie Ziying, were both at the airport to greet her. Rong asked Xie to go with him, but she refused. Rong said to Xie Ziying, "She is my wife!" Xie Ziying said, "She is my sister!" Rong then said, "I love her!" Xie said, "Are you going to love her to death again?" In the end, they parted on bad terms.</p>
<p>According to Xie, Rong seemed to still express his love for her, and she was also considering Rong's reputation. However, the dance hostess whom Rong loved was extremely fierce, and Rong was afraid of her power. Therefore, although they were affectionate, there was still a great divide between them. Rong stated that he would never divorce Xie, while Xie, through her former lawyer, proposed to Rong that unless he guaranteed that he would no longer abuse Xie in any way and ended his relationship with the dance hostess Miss Zhang, Xie would return to her husband's house. However, Miss Zhang is currently pregnant and awaiting childbirth, so it seems that a considerable amount of time will be required.</p>
<p>Since returning to Shanghai, Xie has only met with Rong once at the airport. Since then, they have not met again. She has now moved to a relative's home. Because she is very interested in films, she still intends to star in another film. It is said that a film company in the city is in contact with her.</p>

<h3>Tragedy in Changsha; Older Brother Wounds Father with Knife; Younger Brother Kills Older Brother with Hoe</h3>
<p>[Report from Changsha, 9th] Our country is a society that emphasizes reason. The relationships between ruler and subject, father and son, brothers, husband and wife, and friends are the "Five Relationships" that everyone has always respected. This ethical concept is a good way to maintain social morality. Although it cannot be said that our country's social order has relied entirely on this ethical concept for decades, its component must occupy a large weight, which is undeniable. A utilitarianism is currently popular in society. Our country's old-fashioned ethical concepts are gradually declining, but with deep roots, this thousands-year-old ethical concept still remains in the minds of most people. In this era of transformation, a piece of news that "ethics and law" are fighting has appeared in Changsha, attracting the attention of most people. The thing is like this:</p>
<p>In the countryside of Changsha</p>
<p>Zhoujiaba, the seventh bao of Guan township, a gentry surnamed Zhou wearing a blue cloth gown, villagers called him "Third Uncle Zhou," had a well-to-do family and no occupation, relying entirely on inheritance to live. Since the Anti-Japanese War, prices have soared, and life has gradually become unbearable, making him a declining family. He had two sons, the eldest son, Zhou Shoulin, did not finish his studies, wandered around, and gambled for a living. In Zhoujiaba, he had a nickname called "Half Leper" because he did not engage in proper business. After finding a wife for him, he separated and lived aside. The property he was divided into was twelve mu of land and several earthen houses. Shoulin</p>
<p>Became Independent After Dividing the Family.</p>
<p>After that, his behavior became even more unrestrained. In a few years, he gambled away all twelve mu of ancestral property. Recently, his wife, children, and children were all trapped in hunger and famine. He personally went to Changsha for three days and Tongguan for four days (Tongguan is thirty li away from Changsha), and his situation became even more messed up.</p>
<p>The second son, Zhou Shougang, was born when the family was no longer as glorious as before. Then followed the eight years of the Anti-Japanese War. During this difficult period, he went from elementary school to middle school. By the end of the Anti-Japanese War, which was the spring of the Republic of China in the twenty-third year, the last batch of family fields was sold by his brother, and he was finally unable to continue his studies. He joined the youth army. In the past few years, his brother was immersed in alcohol and gambling, and his younger brother carried a gun and endured the torrents of the great era. The two people developed in two extremely different directions.</p>
<p>In December, Changsha had a heavy snow, and the poor could not bear the suffering of hunger and cold. The old and weak turned to the ditch, while the strong went on the road of crime. Although Zhou Shoulin did not become a bandit, he committed</p>
<p>An Unethical Crime</p>
<p>came. One morning, Zhou Shoulin was eager, took a kitchen knife, and went to his father's residence, threatening his father to take out the old-age land deed for him to sell. The father naturally refused. Shoulin, taking advantage of his father's unpreparedness, slashed with the kitchen knife. The third father was old and weak and naturally unable to resist. The tip of the knife hit his forehead, and blood flowed straight down, and he fainted on the ground. After Shoulin injured his father, he calmly went into the room to search for the land deed. It was a narrow road for the enemy. Shoulin's younger brother, Shougang, had recently returned home on leave from the youth army. When he returned from outside, he saw his old father lying in a pool of blood and did not know what was going on. He rushed into the room and saw his brother was searching for the land deed. Knowing that the murderer of his father was originally his brother, he could not suppress his anger. He gave his brother two slaps in the face. Shoulin was now either all in or all out. He took up the</p>
<p>A Hoe</p>
<p>Swung at Shougang. Shougang was quick and dodged aside. He grabbed a bench with his hand and used the legs of the bench to hook Shoulin's neck and pulled hard. Shoulin fell down. Taking advantage of the gap, he took the hoe from Shoulin's hand, raised his hand and hoeed. The brother who killed his father died tragically under the hoe of his brother.</p>
<p>After Shougang killed his brother, he did not run away. He rescued his father and took care of the funeral. After everything was settled, he then reported to the family and asked for a separation. "My brother killed my father, and I killed my brother. It has nothing to do with others. I will never implicate others." The villagers of Xiangdang expressed sympathy for Shougang's killing of his brother, but the national law does not allow Shougang to do this. Paying with one's life for murder, Shougang was finally arrested by the Xiang Township office on the evening of December 21. Now, the official authorities want to punish Shougang, but the people of the Zhou Family Ancestral Hall are unwilling to do so and are appealing for Shougang. What will happen to this case in the future remains to be seen. (Our special correspondent Huang Chao Ru)</p>

<h3>Wuxi Warehouse Director Robs Account Books, Sends Personnel to Collect Military Rice and is Detained</h3>
<p>[This newspaper, Yixing, 12th] The Xiecheng Rice Mill outside the East Gate of this county is established by Wu Wanbang and others with joint investment, and its business is not bad. Last year, due to processing military grain for the government, its internal management was not well-organized, leading to a chaotic state. Ye Changgen, the accountant of the mill, was once detained for failing to deliver military grain on time. However, due to the inability to reconcile the incoming and outgoing accounts with those who handled and delivered the military grain, he found it extremely difficult to settle the accounts for a while. In order to cope with the payment of military grain, he had no choice but to use the rice stored by various households to make advances, and at the same time announced the suspension of business. The manager, Wu Wanbang, is weak in nature and unable to handle the aftermath properly, facing a difficult situation. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Excessive Grain Delivery</p>
<p>The military rice processed by the mill has always been sent to the Wuxi warehouse by personnel. Recently, it was discovered that the receipts for the processed rice delivered in the past did not match, with significant discrepancies. Therefore, on the 3rd of this month, two staff members, Jiang Jinrong and Wang Bingsheng, were sent to Wuxi to settle the accounts. However, Zhang Chenglun, the director of the warehouse, initially made various excuses and then claimed that 400 large packages of military grain were still missing, constantly shirking responsibility and refusing to settle the accounts. The Xiecheng Mill was supposed to deliver 1,100 packages of military grain but actually delivered 1,126 packages, with a surplus of 26 packages, all supported by account statements.</p>
<p>Robbing Receipts</p>
<p>Director Zhang Chenglun (who has been dismissed) knew that the truth would be revealed, so he secretly instructed others to mediate, asking Xiecheng Mill to deliver another 100 packages as a settlement. Jiang Jinrong and Wang Bingsheng did not accept this. On the 4th, Zhang Chenglun, along with staff members Jiang Yanling, He Pingao, and others, went to Room 22 of the Pacific Hotel in Wuxi, where Jiang Jinrong and Wang Bingsheng were staying, claiming to settle the accounts. Jiang and Wang believed them and were preparing to take out the receipts issued by the warehouse. Unexpectedly, Zhang Chenglun, Jiang Yanling, and others pulled out pistols and threatened Jiang and Wang to hand over the receipts and be done with the matter. Jiang and Wang refused, so Zhang and Jiang resorted to punches and kicks and made shooting gestures with their pistols. Jiang and Wang were unable to resist, and all seven account books and receipts were robbed.</p>
<p>Improperly Withdrawing Military Rice</p>
<p>Zhang Chenglun believed that the account books and receipts carried by Jiang Jinrong and Wang Bingsheng had been robbed back and there was no evidence. Therefore, he demanded that they make up for the 400 packages of military rice owed, otherwise he would not settle the accounts. Jiang and Wang then made the excuse that they needed to ask the mill for a decision before settling the accounts. Jiang and Wang quickly returned to Yixing that night to report to the mill. Zhang Chenglun, in order to take preemptive action before Jiang and Wang returned to Yixing, on the same day sent Jiang Yanling and Chen Bingnan, the former warehouse distribution section chief, to Yixing by car under the pretext of collecting sacks, intending to extort 400 packages of warehouse rice from the mill to enrich their own pockets.</p>
<p>Seized Secret Letters</p>
<p>Jiang Jinrong and Wang Bingsheng, staff members of the Xiecheng Mill, learned about this. They knew that Jiang Yanling and Chen Bingnan were both former employees of the Wuxi warehouse and that Jiang Yanling was the one who threatened them with a pistol and robbed the receipts. This clearly indicated that they were colluding to fraudulently obtain military grain. On the morning of the 9th, they prepared a document and handed over Jiang and Chen to the Xiaohou District Office. District Chief Ou, at the request of the defendants, found two extremely suspicious letters on Jiang and Chen, revealing the malfeasance on paper. It was originally intended to hand them over to the county, but because Jiang and Chen both claimed to be current employees of the provincial government, the matter was purely the work of the former warehouse director Zhang Chenglun alone. Only after Zhang Chenglun arrived at the scene could the truth be revealed. At the moment, Chen Bingnan has rushed to Wuxi to bring Zhang Chenglun to Yixing for settlement, while Jiang Yanling is being monitored. Once Zhang Chenglun is brought to justice, the truth should be revealed.</p>
<h3>The Murder Case of Chairman Li of Jintan: Complex Inside Story, Defendant Retracts Confession</h3>
<p>[This newspaper, Jintan, 13th] The murder case of Vice Chairman Li Xue of Jintan County has been concluded by the District Procuratorate's investigation. In order to handle the case with caution, Presiding Judge Fang Junjie, along with Judges Gu Yang, Prosecutor Wei Guanghan, and Clerk Fang Yingxu, specially formed a collegial panel to hear the case. Because this case is the most significant one handled since the establishment of the court, all parties are paying close attention, and the gallery was full by 9 o'clock.</p>
<p>Plaintiffs Li Zhenxu (Li's eldest son, employed at the Hankou Jiaotong Bank), Li Zhenzhong (second son, working in the engineering field in Peiping), Li Zhenjun (third son, currently a lecturer at National Central University in Nanjing), and Li Zhirui all appeared in court on time to answer questions. The plaintiffs unanimously stated that the defendant, Yuan Wenbin, harbored resentment because he failed to defeat Li in the election for senator. After the defendant, Luo Zhannong, became the district chief of Shangxian District, Li requested the authorities to replace him due to poor governance. Luo also had a close friendship with Yuan Wenbin and had supported Yuan's senatorial campaign. The two are suspected of instigating the murder. Next, the defendants Yuan Xiping and others were interrogated one by one. The defendants Chen Juqing and others all denied any involvement in the case. The entire trial lasted for four hours. Because the defendants uniformly retracted their confessions from the military court, the case became even more complicated. The court decided to postpone the trial for further investigation. Luo Zhannong and Yang Zhengjun were detained, and the remaining defendants were returned to custody.</p>

<h3>"Migratory Boil" and "Migratory Phlegm"</h3>
<p>— Zhu Renkang</p>
<p>"Migratory boils" are not to be feared, "migratory phlegm" is the most serious</p>
<p>Ordinary people only think that "migratory boil" is a serious disease in surgery, but they don't know that "migratory phlegm" is more serious than "migratory boil". Although "migratory boil" and "migratory phlegm" are both external diseases and their conditions are very similar, they are actually very different.</p>
<p>"Migratory boil" is extremely rare among people in cities. On the contrary, farmers in rural areas work hard all day long, and they are most likely to develop "migratory boil" due to labor injuries and blood stasis. This disease can occur everywhere. At the beginning, the swollen area does not change in skin color, does not turn red, is swollen and has no head, but it causes pain. After about one or two weeks, the pain increases, the swelling expands, it does not subside with cold or heat, and pus has formed inside. It is still not easy to detect on the outside. Only an experienced doctor can diagnose it. It is advisable to have surgery quickly. The pus is thick and plentiful, even several bowls. With proper treatment, it can be closed in ten to twenty days, which is a mild case.</p>
<p>"Migratory phlegm" is different. There are quite a few patients in Shanghai. What we come into contact with is usually mistaken for migratory boils, but most of them are this kind of "migratory phlegm". People in cities are usually pampered and well-maintained, but their physical constitutions are weak, so they are prone to this kind of tuberculous external disease, and it can occur everywhere. At the beginning, there is a lump that is slightly swollen but does not feel any pain. Because it does not feel pain, it is left untreated. After a year and a half, it feels painful and you think of seeking treatment, then it is too late. It eventually becomes soft and suppurates, flowing with yellow water mixed with rotten chunks, and cannot be closed. The wound is recessed. Because it does not close, it is mistaken for a fistula, but it is not a fistula. The body becomes more and more weakened. If there are also symptoms such as coughing, night sweats, and tidal fever, it becomes pulmonary tuberculosis. If it can be treated early, and attention is paid to maintaining the body, cultivating and nourishing it, there is also hope for a cure.</p>
<p>Regarding the points of differentiation between the above two diseases, "migratory boil" rises quickly, either dissipates or suppurates, so it heals quickly. "Migratory phlegm" rises very slowly, so it is difficult to cure!</p>
<h3>Why is a Child Thin? Related to Worm Disease</h3>
<p>— Xu Zhongcai</p>
<p>Parents are very concerned about their children being thin and often try every means to find ways to nourish them, but the effect is minimal. Why is this?</p>
<p>You must know that if a child has no other symptoms, but is only pale and thin, listless, and the body is getting weaker day by day, and the stool is loose, sometimes constipated, then you should suspect worm disease. Worm diseases include roundworms, tapeworms, duodenal worms, whipworms, etc.</p>
<p>Almost everyone knows about roundworms. They are similar to earthworms and lay eggs in the human body. They are excreted with feces. Chinese people usually use feces as fertilizer, which is often attached to vegetables and fruits. If they are not cooked thoroughly, children who eat them will also have worm disease.</p>
<p>Tapeworms have flat bodies, connected by a number of segments. The longest can reach several feet. They are mostly transmitted by eating undercooked fish, beef, pork, etc., and parasitize in the intestines.</p>
<p>Whipworms mostly parasitize near the cecum and are less harmful to the human body.</p>
<p>Children with duodenal worms, which are three to five minutes long, often have special hobbies, such as eating soil, paper scraps, cloth scraps, charcoal ash, etc.</p>
<p>Treatment should distinguish which type of worm disease it is and administer the appropriate anthelmintic. In addition, it is advisable to assist digestion and supplement nutrition. The machine child pills and eight treasure cakes sold in pharmacies can be eaten regularly.</p>
<h3>Stroke</h3>
<p>— Cheng Guoshu</p>
<p>Stroke is a disease with distinctions between stroke-like conditions and true stroke. They are described separately below:</p>
<p>"Stroke-like conditions" are called cerebral hemorrhage by Western medicine. Those affected are mostly over forty years old, especially obese people. It originates from arteriosclerosis in the elderly, where miliary aneurysms occur in the blood vessels in the brain, and blood pressure is high, that is, the amount of blood flowing into the brain is large and the pressure increases, causing the blood vessels to rupture and bleed. There are sudden symptoms such as loss of consciousness and speech, fixed eyes and blank stare, locked jaw, rattling sounds in the throat, coarse breathing, or hemiplegia. If the mouth is open and the eyes are closed, the pulse is thin and weak, and there is urinary incontinence, danger is imminent. It is mostly caused by severe physical shocks, sudden falls, head injuries, or special mental excitement, excessive drinking, overeating, prolonged mahjong games, or strenuous efforts during bowel movements, or prolonged bathing, all of which can cause high blood pressure and lead to stroke-like symptoms. Antelope horn is an essential medicine for this disease. It can lower blood pressure and has the effect of preventing cerebral hemorrhage, but it must be used heavily, otherwise it will be ineffective. After consciousness is restored and speech is possible, the residual hemiplegia should be treated with products that nourish and activate the blood for long-term use to open the tendons and relax the collaterals, slowly working towards recovery.</p>
<p>"Warning signs and prevention": If there are symptoms such as numbness in the fingers, a feeling of ants crawling on the skin, unclear speech, ringing in the ears, head distension and dizziness, red eyes, or abnormal mental state, one should be careful of the sudden onset of stroke-like conditions. For prevention, one can regularly take kelp, kombu, and celery to alleviate arteriosclerosis (Foci Pharmaceutical Factory's Kelp Crystals are convenient and easy to take).</p>
<p>"True stroke" is a disease where one is suddenly struck by a strong wind, falls unconscious, and dies suddenly. There is no such disease in the south, so it will be briefly omitted.</p>

<h3>Hemiplegia</h3>
<p>— Ruan Xinmin</p>
<p>Hemiplegia is a relatively common abstract term, describing that half of the body, either left or right, cannot move. Medical books define it as hemiplegia, distinguishing between two types: internal wind and external wind. Internal wind is the stroke commonly seen today (see separate article). External wind is mostly caused by women with frequent childbirth and blood deficiency, or obesity and excessive dampness. The former, "internal wind," necessarily involves a crooked mouth and eyes, and slurred speech. The latter, "external wind," is when blood deficiency and wind-dampness enter the collaterals, and the flow of Qi and blood is obstructed, so it gradually arises, solely affecting the meridians and joints, slowly making the hands and feet inconvenient to move. Although the causes of external and internal wind are different, and their onset is different, the consequences are equal, as the meridians and nerves are unfavorable. Those suffering from this disease, in addition to losing autonomy of movement, do not have much change in internal organs and the stomach, so they can eat as usual, and with proper care, they can live long with the disease. When its early stages are felt with vertigo ("high blood pressure") and soreness at the time of insistence, applying gold needle treatment, internally taking potions that calm the liver, subdue Yang, soothe the muscles, and activate the collaterals, can often moisten the dead muscles and revive them, returning to a withered state to flourish. What is hemiplegia to be afraid of? Once it becomes a reality, the root of the disease is deep, and the blood vessels and nerves are hardened, losing their working efficiency. Although there is the wonderful art of gold needles and symptomatic medicines, it will not work without long-term treatment.</p>
<h3>From Menstruation to Childbirth</h3>
<p>— Shen Zhongli</p>
<p>A woman's menstrual blood comes once a month, which is normal. There are exceptions, such as once every two months, called combined months, once every three months, called residence months, once a year, called avoiding years, and never in a lifetime, called dark menstruation. All these kinds of things, although they are different from the ordinary, are not diseases, and they still have the ability to conceive.</p>
<p>The female reproductive function is entirely in the eggs discharged by the ovaries. If the ovarian function is incomplete, or the ovaries atrophy, and cannot discharge eggs, even if there is menstruation, they cannot reproduce. That is to say, although menstruation comes on time, there is menstrual abdominal pain, back pain, dizziness, unclean leucorrhea, or a naturally obese body, hindering the passage of the egg, so it cannot be conceived. Ancient books record that there are five types of infertility, called snail, pattern, drum, horn, and pulse, which are the abnormalities of the uterus in modern people. The reason is the acquired fracture, resulting in the unsoundness of the uterus and fallopian tubes. Even if pregnancy occurs, it can even form a hydatidiform mole, ectopic pregnancy, and other dangers. Furthermore, there are countless people who cannot reproduce for life due to venereal diseases.</p>
<p>Once menstruation is found to be pathological, reproduction is bound to be hindered. Therefore, if you want to have children, you must first adjust menstruation, use medicine according to the constitution and reality, and you can succeed. There are three effective prescriptions in the book, such as for those who cannot reproduce due to irregular menstruation, take Yimu Shengjin Dan (rehmannia, angelica, white peony, chuanxiong, salvia, motherwort, cyperus, atractylodes, motherwort). For those with uterine cold and weakness (that is, the acquired decline in the function of the uterus and fallopian tubes), take Zhongzi Pills (angelica, cistanche, lotus, eucommia, cuscuta, epimedium, tongsha yuan, yunling, psoralea, achyranthes, lycium, cinnamon, aconite, fish maws). For those with obese bodies and fatty membranes (that is, incomplete ovarian development and excessive secretion of acidic vaginal fluid), use Siwu Tang combined with Cangfu Yin Liushen Tang (angelica, chuanxiong, raw land, white peony, pinellia, tangerine red, acorus, bile star, inula, tuckahoe). Prescribe according to the symptoms, or change it to a medicinal ointment and take nine doses regularly, which is said to be the most reasonable good prescription for seeds.</p>

<h3>Industry and Commerce Representative Wu Yun Chu Goes to Nanjing to Request Government to Restore Loans, Attending National Economic Committee Report Today</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper Nanjing, 14th] Regarding the issue of opening up industrial and commercial loans, the Four-Bank Joint Office previously sent letters to the National Bank Bureau to solicit opinions. It is now learned that various related opinions have been successively sent to the Four-Bank Secretariat for research, and they can be discussed at the board meeting.</p>
<p>[This Newspaper Nanjing, 14th] Director of the Executive Yuan Information Bureau, Dian Xianguang, said at the reception on the 14th that the National Bank Bureau does not intend to make any changes to the method of suspending loans in the near future. Loans that have been released in the past and have expired should continue to be collected. As for what method will be adopted in the future to use various funds to support industry and commerce, the method is still under study, and there is currently no concrete decision.</p>
<p>Chairman of the National Industrial Association, Wu Yunchu, went to Nanjing by car last night to represent the industrial community in requesting the authorities to restore loans to adjust funds, develop industry, and increase production. It is reported that Mr. Wu brought with him to Nanjing concrete opinions from the industrial community on opening up loans, and will attend today's National Economic Committee regular meeting in Beijing to report. It is also learned that the Four-Bank Joint Office is scheduled to hold a board meeting within the next few days to conduct research.</p>
<p>Since the government stopped industrial loans and inward remittance for goods, the industrial community has been feeling increasingly difficult due to insufficient working capital, and has been requesting relief. The National Industrial Association has submitted a request to the government to quickly open up conditionally. The government believes that the past industrial goods methods were not appropriate and requires the industrial community itself to propose methods for the主管authorities to study. It is now learned that the association has combined various opinions and proposed the following five suggestions:</p>
<p>1. Loan Target: Limited to production enterprises that are necessary for people's livelihood and are in real economic distress.</p>
<p>2. Loan Use: Used to purchase necessary raw materials and pay wages, and cannot be transferred to other uses.</p>
<p>3. Loan Application Procedure: Whether each factory's loan application is truly necessary must be initially reviewed by its affiliated trade association before being submitted to the主管机构 for approval. (Because the trade association knows more about the actual situation of each factory)</p>
<p>4. Audit of Loan Use: The lending bank should check the use of the loan at any time to prevent hoarding and speculation.</p>
<p>5. Loan Collateral: Industrial products or production equipment and factory buildings are provided as collateral.</p>

<h3>Transportation Management Committee Relaxes Restrictions, Approves Import of Raw Materials</h3>
<p>China National Products Joint Venture Corporation and China National Products Production and Marketing Association recently requested the Transportation Management Office to not strictly restrict the import methods of raw materials for export products in order to promote agricultural product exports. The office has replied in separate letters, stating that the above-mentioned methods have been approved by the Executive Yuan and will be announced in the near future. Article 2 of the methods stipulates that "If the value of imported raw materials does not exceed 40% of the export value of their finished products, or the export of their finished products has a history and is of value to promote, and has been specially approved by the Career Import and Export Management Committee, their import will be approved." According to this provision, if there are situations that meet this provision in the future implementation, the methods can be applied. However, regarding the above-mentioned situation, it is hoped that the two companies can provide specific information for future reference by the association and the Ministry of Economic Affairs when discussing the types of raw materials to which the methods apply. Article 3 of the methods stipulates that imported raw materials must be processed and manufactured before being exported, so the imported raw materials are limited to those directly required for manufacturing export products, and this principle cannot be changed. However, the association has now allocated supplementary methods, which aim to assist exporters in importing raw materials, increasing production, and transporting a portion of the increased products abroad in exchange for foreign exchange. It is reported that the Career Management Committee has scheduled to start handling application procedures within this month. Applicants must guarantee that the raw materials imported will be manufactured into finished products and can be exported in exchange for foreign exchange before they can be approved.</p>

<p>Published by World Book Company</p>
<p>As the author states in the "Preface": "This is a book that offers a bird's-eye view and an introduction." A bird's-eye view must be broad and high, comprehensively describing the important theories of various schools and important materials, so that readers can gain a clear understanding. As for an introduction, it must objectively narrate what readers want to know in detail and with appropriate emphasis, so as to motivate readers to learn. This work is not easy, but this "Sociology of Education" has achieved this goal in a short space.</p>
<p>The book is divided into ten lectures: The first lecture, The Development of Sociology of Education, describes the history of the development of this discipline. It first explains the two broad meanings proposed by Dewey: society continues through education; education proceeds through society. Then, based on recent sociological research, it discusses the establishment of scientific sociology of education. Sociology of education must study the relationship between education and society, analyze the educational missions of various social groups, and the social significance that education should emphasize. This emerging discipline (which has made rapid progress since 1908, only forty years ago) has moved from purely theoretical research to applied research.</p>
<p>The second lecture, The Current Status of Sociology of Education, describes the important literature of this discipline and introduces the works of Zhang Xuelou (W.E. Chancellor), F.R. Clow, R. Groves, W.R. Smith, D. Snedden, and C.C. Peters. The author also explains the two major schools of thought in sociology of education: the educational school and the sociological school, and then concludes with the new trends in the research of this discipline, which takes into account both society and education, and studies both social phenomena and educational phenomena.</p>
<p>The third lecture, The Scope of Sociology of Education, separately describes the items to be studied in sociology of education: collecting the principles of how human beings live in social groups; explaining the influence of various social groups on other social groups; studying the education needed by various social groups; pointing out the mission of schools to other social groups; understanding the mission of various social groups to education; and explaining the relationship between education and social sanctions, heredity, and progress. As for the scope of research, it involves sociology of education and educational psychology; sociology of education and educational philosophy; and the research of sociology of education and social education.</p>
<p>The fourth and fifth lectures, The Relationship between Education and Society, are divided into four aspects: the relationship between education and social organization; the relationship between education and social sanctions; the relationship between education and social heredity; and the relationship between education and social progress. Various social groups are divided into three categories according to their different forms of combination: the first category is called primary groups, such as family, playmates, and neighborhoods; the second category is called secondary groups, such as countries and international organizations; the third category is called intermediate groups, such as professional groups and academic groups. In order to enable children and young people to have a good adaptation to these social groups, the power of education should be used to seek the coordination of the relationship between individuals and social groups. The relationship between education and social sanctions can be seen in the relationship between religion and education, law and education, and public opinion and education. The relationship between education and social heredity should not be ignored. Social heredity depends on the advancement of education, because the role of education is to transmit social heritage, so that excellent culture can be passed on to future generations, and human life experience can also be preserved. Finally, the author specifically explains the creative value of education when discussing the relationship between education and social progress. "It can be seen that in order to seek social progress, whether from a biological or social point of view, education must be assisted; this is because education is the basic work and a force driving society."</p>
<p>The sixth lecture, Education and Social Principles, the author argues from three aspects: education and democracy, education and social efficiency, and education and cultural concepts. The central idea does not deviate from the people-oriented ideal of education. The characteristics of modern social life can be said to be democratic, that is, popular; efficient, that is, practical; and cultural, that is, civilized. To seek the expansion and progress of modern life, we must rely on the efforts of educators.</p>
<p>The seventh lecture, Educational Survey, applies sociological methods to educational research and implementation. There is a concise description of the historical facts related to educational surveys in the book. The important contents of the survey include: the nature of the school and educational needs; school buildings and equipment; administrative organization; teachers; staffing; curriculum; teaching; and the relationship between school and society. Educational surveys have made great contributions to educational implementation and educational academics, which can integrate administration and theory, and educational academics have also become true and practical academics, not just empty theories.</p>
<p>The eighth lecture, School Administration, is not a general discussion of school administration, but from a social perspective, it explains that school administration must emphasize social significance. The author divides school administration into two aspects: one can be called external school administration, that is, the general management of schools by the state and the public; the other can be called internal school administration, that is, the specialized management of schools by school staff.</p>
<p>The ninth lecture, Curriculum, is the main topic to be studied in sociology of education. The curriculum is the content of education, and the content of education must be based on social needs, and of course, the order of children's physical and mental development cannot be ignored. The author also explains the trends of curriculum reform based on the theory and methods of sociology of education, which is valuable research.</p>
<p>The tenth lecture, Teaching Methods, discusses the relationship between teaching methods and curriculum, the meaning of teaching methods and the central principles. It further elaborates on individual and group teaching methods. There is also appropriate criticism of socialized teaching. Finally, it describes the social significance of discipline, promoting the spirit of freedom and democratic thought.</p>
<p>Although Chen's book cannot be said to be a great academic work, in a small space, it can enable readers to have a bird's-eye view of the essence, important theories, and methods of sociology of education. After reading this book, the author feels that the study of education should not focus on psychology or sociology, but on a clear understanding of the relationship between the development of individual psychology and social phenomena. The purpose of education is to fully develop individuality (individual initiative and creativity) in the entire society, so that individuals can do their best to benefit society. To achieve this goal, the curriculum must be changed to meet social needs, so that those who are educated develop a normal and healthy "personality," and this personality is suitable for sociality. Of course, teaching methods must also follow this ideal, paying attention to the various influences of the social environment on the attitude of individual life.</p>
<h3>European War History</h3>
<p>— Chu Yukun</p>
<p>By Tang Zichang, published by Yongxiang Printing Company, divided into eight volumes</p>
<p>Regarding the works on the Second World War, in the British and American publishing circles, they have been published one after another, like mushrooms after a rain; although China's publishing circles are inferior in comparison, they have made progress compared to after the First World War. I remember that after the Second World War, China's publishing circles only had Zhang Naiyan's "European War History", and this European War History was of a translated nature, not a real work. However, after the Second World War, several works and translations have been published; for example, my humble work, A History of the Second World War, focuses on diplomatic activities between countries, and does not pay much attention to the shift of war, so it is omitted and not detailed. However, after reading Mr. Tang Zichang's great work, European War History, the course of the European War is described in great detail. The whole book has 1.5 million words, divided into eight volumes: The Beginning of the European War; The Central European Theater; The Northern European Theater; The Western European Theater; The Southern European Theater; The Eastern European Theater; The European Fortress; A General Review of the European War.</p>
<p>Regardless of its content, in the impoverished Chinese publishing world, the publication of this great work is a commendable thing after all. At least, it can be seen that Chinese academics are independent and no longer rely on the works of foreigners. This progress is especially worthy of our cherish. Therefore, I would like to introduce it to all readers.</p>
<p>The first volume, The Beginning of the European War, not only clarifies the reasons for the outbreak of the Second World War: the influence of the Treaty of Versailles; the agitation of the global war; the political conflicts of the European powers; the military competition of the European powers, but also briefly describes the course of the European War, until Hitler surrendered and the European War ended. This volume can be regarded as an introduction, or as a unit with its own independence.</p>
<p>The second volume, The Central European Theater, focuses on the German-Polish War. It first explains the geographical situation of Central Europe, recalls the process of the merger of Germany and Austria and the disintegration of Czechoslovakia, and points out the ambition of Nazi Germany for Central Europe. It finally broke out into a European war due to the Polish problem. This is the prelude to the European War. Germany adopted a blitzkrieg strategy against Poland, and won a great victory in less than a month. General Tang Zichang, the author, is good at military strategy, and his comments on the gains and losses of the blitzkrieg strategy are very detailed.</p>
<p>The third volume, The Northern European Theater, completely describes the course of the Finnish War and the Norwegian War. However, the biggest feature of the book is to describe the relationship between naval warfare and the air force. In simple terms, the victory or defeat of naval warfare completely depends on the superiority or inferiority of the air force on both sides, and the strength of the navy is secondary. This is different from the First World War.</p>
<p>The fourth volume, The Western European Theater, focuses on the French-German War, and describes the tragedy of France in detail.</p>
<p>The fifth volume, The Southern European Theater, covers a wide range, from the Balkans in the north to Africa in the south, and also includes Italy and the Near East. Is it appropriate to call this theater the Southern European Theater? It remains to be discussed.</p>
<p>The sixth volume, The Eastern European Theater, completely describes the course of the German-Soviet War, but the strategic comments of both Germany and the Soviet Union are very detailed. In essence, Germany also adopted a blitzkrieg strategy against the Soviet Union, but it was impossible to seek a quick victory, and it fell into a mistake. The Soviet Red Army's strategy, on the one hand, was to buy time; on the other hand, it engaged in a holistic war, which eventually led to the failure of the blitzkrieg strategy of the German army.</p>
<p>The seventh volume, The European Fortress, starts from the air war over the European continent, and continues to talk about the opening of the second theater, the meeting of the East and West, and the fall of Berlin, which forced Germany to surrender unconditionally.</p>
<p>The eighth volume, A General Review of the European War, discusses weapons and science in detail, which is most worthy of the attention of people who study national defense and military affairs.</p>
<p>In short, General Tang Zichang's European War History is a work that focuses on the military and weapons, and can be used as a reference for military scholars. In the past, Chinese soldiers often regarded the Art of War as a must-read book, and this European War History can be used as a must-read reference book. But it also has its shortcomings, that is, it lacks a correct understanding of the nature of this war. We cannot but regard this as a shortcoming.</p>
<h3>"The Psychology of Children's Painting"</h3>
<p>— Wen Zhaotong</p>
<p>(By Huang Mo, published by Commercial Press)</p>
<p>After introducing the selected translation of "Research on the Psychology of Children's Painting" in the December 4th issue of this journal, we continue to need to introduce the only special book on the psychology of children's painting by Chinese people, "The Psychology of Children's Painting". This was written by Huang Ji of Zhejiang University Training Institute around 1937. It describes the gains of his many years of research.</p>
<p>The most important part of this book is naturally the third unit, "The Development Process". It originally used the research of the "group method" to observe the general characteristics of children's painting. In other words, it is only the general process of the development of children's depiction psychology.</p>
<p>Huang Yi determined that the development process of children's painting is divided into: the scribbling stage, the symbolic stage or transitional stage, the fixed stage, and the realistic stage.</p>
<p>Children around the age of three to four are in the "scribbling stage". Scribbling is the forerunner of real painting. At this time, what is drawn are some meaningless strokes. At first, they are wavy, then circular, and thirdly, multi-shaped, but children get practice in controlling their arms and pens and paper from this. This kind of scribbling can be compared to the pronunciation game of language. The pronunciation game is also meaningless, repeated, and biased towards rhythmic activities, and it also has the function of preparatory practice for real language.</p>
<p>From the "scribbling stage" to the real painting, it is necessary to go through a "symbolic stage or transitional stage". The paintings in this period are still similar to scribbling, but it can already be explained what things are painted; or first declare what things are to be painted, and then start writing. Children's paintings around the age of five to six can be said to have such a tendency completely.</p>
<p>The golden age of children's painting is around the age of seven to ten. Children are very happy to express themselves freely and create freely. However, the images they depict are not completely correct. It is precisely the lack of the elements of the correctness of the image that uniquely expresses the childish, primitive, simple, and rustic fun of children's books.</p>
<p>For these reasons, the author also collected research data and results from various Chinese and foreign families in this stage, and spent about a quarter of the book to conduct meticulous research and description. First, he studied the evolution of children's drawing of people, and determined that it evolved from tadpole people, gradually complete frontal people, side people, and actions. He also studied examples of beasts, houses, trees, flowers, imitation paintings, etc., and analyzed the characteristics of children's paintings in this period as follows:</p>
<p>Obviously it is not a careful description, but only a kind of simple sketch and design drawing, and regardless of the individual differences of the real object, it is only a rigid, fixed, and拘執模型</p>
<p>The part of the depicted object is often incomplete, and it is extremely subjective to take away.</p>
<p>A fault that seems to be the opposite of omitting important parts is to describe some things that are not seen. The so-called transparent description of children's painting refers to this feature.</p>
<p>A strange mistake that moves a part of one object to another object.</p>
<p>The ratio does not match the actual state.</p>
<p>Due to mechanized automation, the same description will often be made continuously. For example, there will be a few more fingers when describing fingers.</p>
<p>The spatial configuration and organization relationship of objects are incorrect.</p>
<p>The orientation of objects is incorrect, such as inversion and skew.</p>
<p>The two-dimensional depiction of objects.</p>
<p>The transfer of the object's point of view. For example, it should be a side view, but it is still drawn as a front view.</p>
<p>The object's unreasonable distance and size.</p>
<p>Young children cannot imitate paintings or sketch. Although he puts the real object or book in front of him, when painting, he still paints in the way of free painting, and the results are no better than free painting.</p>
<p>As for why children's paintings have these characteristics? According to the "functional psychology" scholars, it is due to "lack of ability"; another is the saying of "evolution", which is very similar to the evolution of biological forms. Therefore, the psychology of children's painting has been　determined to have a principle that has been recognized throughout the ages: "Children draw what they know, not what they see." I don't know if it is the golden rule.</p>
<p>The author observes that the objects depicted by children all have a tendency to succeed in a simple, neat, and fixed stereotype, according to the "best completion law" (Law of Pragnanz) of Gestalt psychology and physics. Especially circles and ellipses, as long as they can be slightly pulled together, they are used everywhere, because this is the simplest and most complete shape. This is also due to the research in "perceptual fixation". It can be said: Children's painting is not due to "the author put this recognized principle, is based on his abstract knowledge, but based on what he directly saw in a natural attitude. The painter's painting is based on what he saw with a special view; the painter's view needs learning, knowledge and training. It is only possible." The errors in children's painting are indeed natural expressions, and those who teach children's art should pay special attention to them.</p>
<p>After the "fixed stage", it is the "realistic stage". Around the age of ten, children begin to acquire a realistic vision, and see all kinds of unsatisfactory places in their works, and begin to feel the technical problems. After this, there are two different development trends: The first is children with talent and the opportunity to receive good training, they continue to develop and reach the realistic realm of art, they learn to observe things with the eyes of a painter, analyze the actual state of light projection under various points of view, correctly express the sense of three-dimensionality and distance, and obtain the coordination of composition and the special artistic conception and taste of beauty. But most children are a sad encounter: they are ambitious but incompetent, discouraged, and the naive self-confidence of the previous period gradually disappears. Under this kind of training, it is not enough to make up for the lack of talent. Under this self-consciousness, hesitation, and restraint, they automatically give up this game. They often want to apologize for their incompetence when describing daytime. So the technology will no longer progress, and most adults' artistic accomplishments in life have never exceeded the higher fixed stage or the initial realistic stage. The stagnation of social art and culture may also be an indirect reason here. Therefore, children's art teachers must also make another plan for children's art education after the age of ten.</p>
<p>This book also describes the "research methods" on the psychology of children's daytime painting, as well as "individual differences and graphic tests", "gender differences", "pictures of children of various ethnic groups", "various aspects of children's pictures and children's psychology", "comparison between children's painting and primitive ethnic painting", "educational conclusions" and other chapters, which have unique insights. However, if the third chapter can be thoroughly understood, these many will become technical questions.</p>
<h3>"Miss Antie"</h3>
<p>— Wei Sha</p>
<p>Written by Ms. Tao Bing, published by China Books and Magazines Company</p>
<p>We love literature and art because they reflect life and beautify the human heart that is immersed in the mundane world. After the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, in today's publishing world where paper is as valuable as gold, only old works are being resold. Moreover, the unstable lives of writers have led to a scarcity of new literary creations.</p>
<p>Therefore, "Gone with the Wind" and "Amber" have gained a large readership in China. Of course, the success of Ms. Margaret Mitchell and Ms. Vanessa is not accidental. Their stories are moving, and their writing is elegant and beautiful. They are not just novels; they are also portrayals of an era of history. Their best-selling status in England and America allows their people to remember the pioneering and striving spirit of their ancestors.</p>
<p>We cannot always look to "Dream of the Red Chamber" to escape reality. We can only use translated novels to satisfy our thirst for knowledge and our parched souls. Because of the narrowness of their lives, Chinese female writers cannot leave the city, so there is a lack of vast creations. In the ten years from the beginning of the Anti-Japanese War to the present, we have only seen one book, "Silent Songstress," by Ms. Fengzi.</p>
<p>I am delighted to introduce to friends who love literature, the creation novel "Miss Antie," published on New Year's Day this year, which has 140,000 words. It made me finish reading it with tears in the warm sunshine. Antie is a husband among women, a hero among female students, a holy, chaste, and extraordinary woman in love, a spokesperson for professional women enduring suffering and appealing to society, and a lyrical cry of the heart for dancers who have been devastated. The stories are intimate and true, the characters are vivid and full of flesh and blood, and the writing style is simple, fluent, and timeless. It is a realistic creation that shocked the literary world. We cheer for this new writer, and we hope that she will work harder to produce a deeper exploration of the tragedy of life and the lonely struggle of suffering women, with delicate descriptions.</p>
<p>"Miss Antie" is heart-wrenching. Raised by her weak and elderly grandmother and nurtured by her widowed mother in poverty, Antie used her intelligence and outstanding academic achievements to win the awards of wise teachers. Under the wings of grace, Antie enriched her knowledge. In an environment where her family was too poor to finish elementary school, she miraculously grasped the first place in the exam for five or six years and completed her high school studies for free. In this bitter childhood growing-up period, her extraordinary victory brought joy to her grandmother in her remaining years, and at the same time, the hopes of the Luo family were pinned on her. Antie knew that her task was to take the place of her deceased father to obtain work and support her mother and younger siblings.</p>
<p>Brought up under the old ethics, she suffered her first love challenge. Her grandmother forced her to give herself to the hypocritical businessman Yang Zhenya, a deceiver who disguised himself as loving, because he used a little money to rescue Antie's family from starvation. However, after he obtained the pure and innocent Antie, satisfied his animal desires, he kicked away the three generations of the Luo family, causing the death of the old Mrs. Luo, breaking Antie's heart, and forcing her to face the cruel reality of life, making her independent personality to survive in the world and her upward will to strive for equal status between men and women even stronger. She is a filial daughter, willing to endure the destruction of her soul, severing her love for her beloved teacher. She bravely sacrificed her beautiful ideals and happiness. Precisely because she was like this, old Mrs. Luo could not close her eyes at her deathbed, repenting and hating the sinister nature of people's hearts, and cherishing the tender grass she had cultivated after being soaked in storms. In her dying moments, she was reluctant to leave the cold world, hoping to return to the garden of her hometown, relive the wounded land, and once again enjoy a warm and peaceful family life. This symbolizes the destruction of the old family and the death of the old ethics. Finally, old Mrs. Luo took her thoughts into the earth. Antie flies like a petrel across the ocean, her long-term fighting spirit was destroyed by the magical hands of a fake female staff member. She retreated on the rugged path of life. In an unreasonable society, a woman with real talent and learning could not obtain a job that could feed her family. Carrying her child after divorce, a small life abandoned at birth, she encountered cold looks everywhere, without the means of socializing, a woman who valued her pure soul had difficulty finding even a position as an elementary school teacher. With her young child crying for food, her mother and younger brother struggling in hunger and cold, Antie's wavering heart and trembling will were shaken. On the advice of a friend with the same fate, she joined the dance floor as a dance partner. She painfully dedicated her youth and beauty, but she still maintained an eternal love for her first lover, Qin Xuan. This bitter medicine of life, the bitter fruit of love, she swallowed with sorrow. Finally, after she was humiliated and harmed, after her child, whom she had cultivated with tears and loneliness, died prematurely, after her mother left the tragic world and her younger brother traveled far away, and even after her lover died in a plane crash, she ended her remaining life, throwing herself into the vast river, like a lotus flower emerging from the mud and returning to the soil. The story full of human touch made me cry.</p>

<h3>The Leftovers of Mice</h3>
<p>— He Ku</p>
<p>There are mice in the office, but I have never seen them, because mice will never come out during the day. But how do I know there is a serious rat infestation in the office? That is clear at a glance every morning when I open the drawer with the key. The drawer is full of orange peels, fruit pits, paper scraps, and even urine stains. Before sitting down to work every day, I must first clean up the leftovers left by the mice that came out last night. They are returning after enjoying themselves, but the cleaning work is done by us, the most intelligent of all things, on their behalf.</p>
<p>These days are approaching the end of the lunar year. Folk legends say that there are programs such as mice getting married at this time. Perhaps the busyness of the mice these nights is equivalent to humans marrying off their daughters-in-law, so the feast in the evening is also an inherent part of the theme. Thinking of this, I feel calm and peaceful when I clear the leftovers for the mice.</p>
<p>However, what attracts my attention is the issue of the mice's food. It is rare to have oranges or fruit pits in the office, and as for bread crumbs, they are extremely rare. To regularly maintain the survival of the mice, where does this food come from?</p>
<p>Later, one day I finally discovered that a small brush band on a pair of paste jars suddenly disappeared. After searching, I finally found it in a corner of the drawer among the pile of paper scraps and carnage! To lick the paste on the band, the mice even scavenged the short bristles on the brush band. And the paste we put on the table, a small half is used up, and a large half is supplied to the mice as regular food. This paste is delivered every two days by a company called "Hygienic Monthly Paste Company." Only now do I know the meaning of the naming. It turns out that "hygienic" means protecting the lives of mice.</p>
<p>Do not underestimate a small mouse. Even if there are mousetraps and ambushes everywhere, they still find ways to find something to eat in hardship to maintain their lives. They never ask others for advice. They only know how to rely on their own efforts. In human society, a certain type of parasitic people should feel ashamed.</p>
<p>Talking About Diamonds — Mao Yi</p>
<p>India is the earliest source of diamonds. The diamonds produced in the gravel layers in India evolved from ancient alluvial layers, and these alluvial layers evolved from materials from the mountains of the Archean period billions of years ago.</p>
<p>These diamonds, crystallized from carbon elements, were later excavated by people in riverbeds and on riverbanks, and sometimes found in dried-up ancient riverbeds. The ancient Indian "diamond panning" technique can still be seen in Ceylon today—they dig shallow pits in the gravel of the mining area, sieve the excavated gravel with bamboo sieves, and then wash it with water. If they are lucky, they can obtain valuable crystalline products.</p>
<p>Before the 18th century, the Indian diamond industry monopolized the world market. However, since diamonds were discovered again in Brazil in 1725, the eastern diamond industry began to decline. Like India, Brazil's diamonds are also stored in ancient gravel layers. Brazilian mines have increased the world's diamond supply by a considerable amount, but their output pales in comparison to that of the later discovered African mines. It is estimated that before eighty years ago, the total number of diamonds larger than thirty carats unearthed worldwide would not exceed one hundred.</p>
<p>The first diamond discovered in South Africa was picked up in 1867 by children of several Dutch immigrants on the banks of the Orange River; the remaining diamonds were discovered the following year at the confluence of the Vaal and Orange Rivers. When a Hottentot tribesman picked up a large diamond of eighty-three and a half carats in 1869, the "diamond rush" began. The tents of the diamond diggers lined the river. Later, diamonds were also found far from the rivers, and these places were called "dry mines," which were originally dried-up ancient riverbeds.</p>
<p>The surface layer of the dry mining area is a layer of loess. However, digging down from the loess layer to a depth of fifty to sixty feet reveals a layer of blue earth, which is where the diamonds are hidden. After washing, they reappear in the world.</p>
<p>In addition to the mining areas formed by ancient riverbeds, South Africa also has olivine rock deposits formed by volcanic eruptions, which are also a source of diamonds. The world's largest olivine rock deposit is the "Premier Mine" near Pretoria. Its thickest diameter exceeds half a mile, covering seventy-eight acres of land, and has been excavated to a depth of nearly seven hundred feet. The world's largest diamond, the "Cullinan," was discovered here in 1905. This huge diamond weighed three thousand and twenty-five carats (or one and one-third pounds). If valued in legal currency, I am afraid that astronomical figures would be overshadowed.</p>
<h3>Indifference</h3>
<p>— Qin Wen</p>
<p>With stimulation, there must be a reaction. From a psychological point of view, humans can make appropriate responses to environmental stimuli through perception. However, after a considerable period of time, they become accustomed to this stimulus and take it for granted. There must be newer changes to produce new reactions. "Habit becomes nature" is a proverb, but it is a correct law that conforms to psychological theory.</p>
<p>So when Grandma Liu entered the Grand View Garden, an old woman from a small, poor village family was suddenly taken to the luxurious and extravagant mansion of the rich and powerful. What she saw and heard, of course, made her feel at a loss and embarrassed. This is because of the sudden difference in the entire way of life. Therefore, based on this stimulus, the reactions generated, in addition to being stunned, are either admiration or disgust and discomfort. But as long as she lives there for half a year or three months, everything will become commonplace. "The strange is no longer strange, and the strange will defeat itself." The peep show has been revealed, so it is no longer surprising. Of course, we do not agree with the mechanistic view that environment determines everything, but we cannot deny the great influence of the environment on the individual's body and mind. "Entering a room of orchids, one does not smell the fragrance for a long time; entering a stall of abalone, one does not smell the stench for a long time." The reason why Mencius' mother chose her neighbors three times was to prevent her son from being confused by the environment and learning some good examples.</p>
<p>From a strict and unyielding attitude towards life, to indulging in corruption, at first one is always unwilling to go with the flow, feeling it is difficult to be compatible. Over time, one becomes indifferent and merges with the darkness, without any sense of propriety, justice, integrity, or shame. Fallen people always go from being incompatible to being indifferent, from "being at odds" to "being in cahoots." Therefore, the "being at odds" stage is often the turning point for attitude changes. Once one reaches the stage of "indifference," it is very difficult to recover. People with numb nerves cannot muster any energy. For example, a pool of stagnant water, occasionally stirred by a pebble, quickly returns to its original state, and can no longer cause any waves.</p>
<p>"A sense of compassion, everyone has it." Humans are originally animals full of compassion. But if one encounters beggars all day long, one becomes indifferent to beggars. If one hears the sound of cannons and guns all year round, one becomes indifferent to war. If one sees refugees and thieves every day, one becomes indifferent to people freezing to death and committing suicide. When one cannot bear to sympathize, one loses sympathy. Will the world one day be like ice, with cold everywhere?</p>
<h3>Emperor Gaozong of Song and Zhang Jun</h3>
<p>— Zheng Guoyi</p>
<p>Zhang Jun was the most prominent among the famous generals of the Southern Song Dynasty, known as Zhang (Jun), Han (Shizhong), Liu (Qi), and Yue (Fei). However, because he failed to maintain his integrity in his later years, pandered to Qin Hui's wishes, supported the peace talks, and was jealous of Liu Qi and Yue Fei's success, his statue is still being spat upon by the West Lake to this day. This is all due to a moment's error in his pursuit of fame, fortune, and wealth.</p>
<p>However, Zhang Jun, apart from this, also had the merit of defending the country with his "Iron Mountain Army." The "History of the Southern Song Dynasty" says, "Zhang Jun had a majestic appearance and a natural seriousness. His military discipline was strict during expeditions and garrison duties. He could win the support of those who surrendered or were captured." "Linquan Yexi" says, "Jun cherished his soldiers, his rewards and punishments were clear and credible, and he planned before fighting, so he never lost." Those who praised him even went so far as to say that he was even better. Therefore, I deeply regret Zhang Jun's failure to uphold his original aspirations. The reason why Zhang Jun did this was probably to discern Emperor Gaozong's intentions. Observing that Gaozong was determined to kill Yue Fei and disliked Han Shizhong, and that after Jun's death, the imperial court's condolences were extraordinary and praised him without reservation, his intentions are clear. The "Chronicle of Events Since the Jianyan Era" records: "On Gui Chou day in the seventh month of autumn in the twenty-fourth year of Shaoxing, Zhang Jun, the Grand Tutor, Duke of Qinghe, Pacifying Minister of Jingjiang, and Commander of the Jinghai Army, died in the imperial court at the age of sixty-nine. The next day, the ministers presented the report. The Emperor said: 'Zhang Jun died suddenly. The envoy Zhang Tonggu came, and his efforts were extremely appropriate. He is different from Han Shizhong and others. The amount of grace should be generous.' He then bestowed a sable crown and court dress for the burial, and ordered the inner servant Zhang Qu to handle the funeral affairs. Jun advocated peace talks in his later years and agreed with Qin Hui's intentions. The Emperor treated him generously." It also said: "On Bing Wu day in the eighth month, the Ministry of Rites drafted the posthumous honors for Zhang Jun, requesting that they follow the example of Han Shizhong. Previously, the Emperor commented on Qin Hui, saying: 'No military official is like Zhang Jun, who is ten thousand times better than Han Shizhong. The posthumous honors should be reviewed by the relevant officials and should be as generous as possible according to past practices.' When it was presented, the Emperor said: 'When he was in Mingshou, Jun had 8,000 soldiers stationed in Wujiang. Zhu Shengfei issued a decree to send him to Qin Prefecture, but Jun refused. He advanced his troops and defeated the bandits, which was truly meritorious. He can be granted the title of Wang with one character, and the Ministry of Rites should draft the decree.' Therefore, he was specially named the Prince of Zhen. Since the posthumous conferment of the Prince of Zhen, no one with a different surname has been conferred the title of Prince of Zhen. It all started with Jun. He was buried in Wuxi County, and the generals and prefects who paid tribute were numerous. Jiangzuo considered it an honor." Zhang Jun's posthumous favors were so great. The Zhang Tonggu mentioned above was the envoy from the Jin Dynasty who came to negotiate peace. And the so-called "advancing troops to defeat the bandits in Mingshou" refers to Emperor Gaozong's restoration. When Gaozong was deposed and imprisoned by Miao Fu and Liu Zhengyan in Mingshou, his restoration was mostly due to the merits of Zhang Jun and Han Shizhong. Han Shizhong even captured Miao and Liu alive and presented them as prisoners to the court. How can Zhang Jun, who was attached to Han Shizhong, be regarded as insignificant? Yet he said that he was "ten thousand times better than Han Shizhong." What does this mean? His intention was clearly focused on Zhang Tonggu's coming to negotiate peace, not on the restoration of Mingshou. Han Shizhong's loyalty, bravery, and integrity were the same as Yue Fei's, and he remained stubborn and did not agree to the peace talks, which was also the same as Yue Fei's. However, the reason why Shizhong did not die while Fei did was that Shizhong's merits were higher than Yue Fei's, and his rank was also higher. Gaozong and Qin Hui had no excuse to attack him. Killing Fei was precisely to make Shizhong fearful. Zhu Wen Gong (Xi) said: "Fei died, and then Han Shizhong was defeated." This one sentence fully expresses the reality of that day. Emperor Gaozong was most afraid of Han Shizhong and Yue Fei among the generals. Fei's crudeness was even more pronounced than Shizhong's, so Fei was finally executed, and Shizhong was almost spared. Gaozong feared the Jin people like tigers externally and feared that the generals would not obey his orders internally, fearing that he would not be able to sit in his position for a day. Zhang Jun had known this for a long time, and his monarch and minister had understood each other's hearts for a long time. Therefore, he realized that the court wanted to dismiss the generals to the extreme, so he first requested to hand over his troops. When the Jin Dynasty again captured Chusi and Yangzhou, Jun never sent troops across the river to solidify the peace talks, all of which deeply conformed to Emperor Gaozong's intentions. Gaozong treated Shizhong with excessive indulgence and regarded him as the most favored among the generals. The edicts to Yue Fei were also full of warm words. His words to Zhang Jun were often full of reprimands and warnings. But in the end, after Fei was convicted, he also had derogatory remarks about Shizhong. And when Jun died, his praises were so beautiful that it is clear that Gaozong's generous treatment of Shizhong and his comforting of Yue Fei were out of deep fear of their future coercion, and his criticism of Jun alone was because he regarded him as a confidant. How dare Jun not advocate peace talks and frame Yue Fei, to plan for his family's future? Therefore, I say that Jun's crime was actually caused by Gaozong. Without Jun, Fei would have died anyway. This is the root of the argument. However, is it also unjust that he knelt before Yue Fei's tomb for a long time, leaving a bad name for thousands of years?</p>
<h3>Suggestions to the Post Office</h3>
<p>— Mang</p>
<p>The increase in postal rates caused a storm in the Executive Yuan and the Legislative Yuan. Now the price increase is no longer a problem, but whether it can maintain the original price in the future is still a question because prices are rising too fast!</p>
<p>Why do postal rates have to rise? The reason is of course because of the large expenses. According to the General Post Office, printing many stamps alone costs a lot of money. Adding in the large expenses, it is certainly not enough to cover the costs, so we have to resort to raising prices. However, the continuous price increases of state-owned enterprises have at least had some impact on prices.</p>
<p>Can we call for no increase in postal rates? This is impossible. So, what better way is there to solve this problem? I think: the American method is worth imitating, that is, to combine envelopes, stationery, and stamps into one, and have the post office print and sell a special envelope. The inside of the envelope serves as stationery, and the envelope is printed with stamps. The sender only needs to write, fold it up, and glue it together. In this way, the procedures and wages for printing beautiful stamps are enough to print the entire letter of envelope, stationery, and stamps together.</p>
<p>Adopting this method seems to have many conveniences:</p>
<p>Convenience for the Post Office—The Post Office has already created standard envelopes and standard stationery. Now it has to print many stamps, which is not only cumbersome, but also costs a lot of money. Printing the new three-in-one envelopes and stationery can save a lot of expenses. Moreover, the uniform format and size are of great convenience to postal workers, and it can also save a lot of paper consumption.</p>
<p>Convenience for Senders—Senders only need to purchase this letter set from the post office, and they no longer need to buy stationery and stamps, which can avoid many trivial troubles.</p>
<p>Since there are so many conveniences, why doesn't the post office try it out? I dare to offer this to the postal authorities.</p>
<h3>Burma (Part 1)</h3>
<p>— Ling Xiaohan Pavilion</p>
<p>Burma declared independence at the beginning of this year (January 4, 1948). Major countries in Europe, Asia, and America have sent congratulations and best wishes. This is also a major event in the new era.</p>
<p>The largest country on the Asian continent is only China. To its east are Korea, Japan, and Ryukyu, to its northwest are the Mongolian and Tibetan regions, and to its southwest are India, Burma, and Vietnam, like satellites. The Qing Dynasty repeatedly used troops in the northwest and southwest, especially in the sixty years of Qianlong, which was known as the "Ten Complete Military Campaigns," and reducing Burma was one of the ten achievements. The northwest showed significant achievements in expanding territory, while the southwest, a smoky and swampy area in the tropics, was never actually conquered. In the eighteenth year of Qianlong, the two local chieftains on the border attacked each other, and the Burmese intervened, taking the opportunity to invade internally, which led to the disputes between the Qing and Burma. Governor Liu Zao committed suicide because the matter was thorny, and Grand Secretary Yang Ying was killed for mishandling the situation. General Mingrui led his troops to attack and died in battle along with the great general Guan Yinbao. Qianlong was angry and indignant and issued a decree saying: These desolate borders are not worth using troops, but now that we have started, we cannot stop. So he appointed the imperial relative Grand Secretary Fu Heng as the strategist and Minister Agui led fierce generals and heavy troops on a major southern expedition. Before leaving, he secretly instructed that he only needed to win one or two battles to save the face of the Celestial Dynasty and then return to the capital. Fu Heng and other large troops set out from Beijing, mighty and unstoppable, first announcing their intentions, and then launching a sharp attack. As expected, they won several battles in a row. The Burmese king was afraid and asked for peace, and the Qing people also took this opportunity to end the war, making Burma a "tributary state." (Tributary states only paid tribute on time and offered congratulatory tables and gifts, completing the ceremony of a small country to the "Celestial Dynasty." Like Korea, Burma, Thailand, and Vietnam, they were completely autonomous in their internal affairs. The routine court visits and tribute matters were handled by the "Ministry of Rites." This was different from the northwestern Mongolian and Tibetan regions, where imperial envoys were stationed and managed by the "Ministry of Dependencies.")</p>
<p>In 1885, due to the treaty signed after the Sino-French War, France annexed Vietnam (Annam). The following year, Britain annexed Burma, like a piece of music being played in succession. Thailand, on the other hand, maintained its autonomy by being squeezed by the two powers. The southwestern border of China was completely dismantled. This was the event of the eleventh or twelfth year of Guangxu in the Qing Dynasty.</p>
<p>After Burma belonged to Britain, it was connected to India and was simply called Burma, which was part of India on British maps (Governed as a part of British India). For sixty years, although under foreign rule, it still maintained its culture and customs. Because of its abundant resources, life was quite comfortable. Now it has declared independence and restored its political power. However, after examining Articles 6, 7, and 8 of the Anglo-Burmese Agreement regarding British debt and British commerce, and Article 4 regarding national defense, it is just as Burmese Prime Minister Thakin Nu said, "True independence must be achieved after the economic problems are solved. First, we must unite internally, endure a hundred times the hardship, and embark on the long road of construction. Otherwise, military, political, and economic opportunities will indirectly give others the chance to control us." This is indeed a wise and insightful statement. During the Anti-Japanese War, China sent a large army into Burma to help destroy the enemy. We are friends in need. Therefore, we know that this independence, from the head of state downwards, sending sincere congratulatory messages is definitely not a mere formality, but has a deep and meaningful significance.</p>
<h3>Wandering Flower</h3>
<p>— Chen Shenyan</p>
<p>Chapter Six: Misfortunes Never Come Singly (42)</p>
<p>Zhu Zhai deeply understood Yunqing's feelings. Outwardly cold but inwardly warm, when you were unhappy, she would carefully comfort and console you. When you were happily cheerful, she would give you a soft rebuke, making you both cry and laugh. Thus, he furrowed his brow, shook his head, and said, "There's nothing to say. I'd rather become a wandering monk than live in such a family." Yunqing said, "Are you arguing with your wife again? You've only been married for a few months. How can you argue with your wife every day?" Zhu Zhai said, "There's no reasoning with such a person. She's meticulous about trivial matters but careless about important ones. Her vision is too short-sighted, and her actions are despicable. If she continues like this, all my friends will be offended!" Yunqing said, "What exactly happened?" Zhu Zhai said, "There's nothing to say. From today on, I won't go home anymore. Let her do whatever she wants!" Yunqing said, "You should explain clearly what happened that makes you hate her so much." Zhu Zhai said, "Her crimes are countless." Yunqing said, "It can't be that bad! Sometimes her mind isn't clear, but she's loyal and honest. You should forgive her for everything!" Zhu Zhai said, "Since our marriage, I've been forgiving her every day. Now, I can't bear it anymore. I must divorce her!" Yunqing said, "You keep talking about divorce. Will the family allow such a thing?" Zhu Zhai said, "The mental stimulation I've suffered is too great. If this continues, I'll go crazy! I don't care if the family allows it or not. Even if I can't formally divorce her, I'll divorce her informally. I'll never go home, and she can sit on the sidelines for the rest of her life!" Yunqing said, "Your approach is too ruthless." Zhu Zhai said, "The environment has forced me to do this. If she's smart, she'll propose a divorce herself. I can give her a considerable alimony. Otherwise, I'll just leave her aside and let her suffer." Yunqing said, "If she doesn't agree to a formal divorce, you can never remarry!" Zhu Zhai said, "Legally, if I remarry while she's not divorced, it's a crime of bigamy. But outside the law, there are ways. Besides, if my goal isn't achieved, I won't remarry for the rest of my life, and that's okay!" Yunqing was very moved when she heard the phrase "if my goal isn't achieved." She thought to herself that his intentions hadn't changed. If he could divorce his wife, the second step would naturally be to repeat his previous words, pursuing me and achieving his original goal. If he hasn't forgotten his feelings, how could I have forgotten my original aspirations! I've always endured the pain in my heart, and for the sake of appearances, I didn't dare to show any emotion. Now that he has this intention, I should not only not oppose it but also support him. With these thoughts running through her mind, Yunqing lowered her eyes, bit her lip, and silently twisted her handkerchief.</p>

<p>Reader Consultation Legal Clarification</p>
<h3>Three-Year House Rental Agreement; Thug Refuses to Pay Rent</h3>
<p>A reader, Mr. Jia, has a house rented to Mr. Yi, stipulating a three-year term, expiring at the end of February next year. However, Mr. Yi is a local thug and has refused to pay rent since January of this year. Questions: Can the original contract be terminated, and Mr. Yi be compelled to move out due to his refusal to pay rent before the end of the term? If Mr. Yi refuses to fulfill the contract after the expiration date, what measures can be taken to make him move out? If Mr. Jia does not use the house himself after the expiration date, does Mr. Yi have the right to renew the lease? Can Mr. Jia refuse to renew the lease due to Mr. Yi's refusal to pay rent during the lease term and rent it to a third party?</p>
<p>[Lawyer Fu Kuanglin Answers] If the lessee fails to pay the rent on the agreed date, and the lessor urges payment but the lessee still fails to pay the accumulated rent (excluding the security deposit), for more than two months, the contract may be terminated, and the house may be recovered (see Article 440 of the Civil Code and Article 100, Paragraph 3 of the Land Act). First apply for mediation by the court. If mediation fails, file a lawsuit according to law. If the lessee does not constitute grounds for termination of the contract at the end of the term, he still has the right to continue the lease. The law does not restrict Mr. Jia from not renewing the lease due to the lessee's breach of contract and failure to pay rent, nor from renting it to anyone else.</p>
