<h3 id="c36">三十七年國慶獻辭 <a href="#c36" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e36" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">36</a></h3>
<p>中華民國三十七年的國　，又在天高氣爽風和日麗的季節到臨了。回想三十六年前的今天，武昌城内工兵營一聲砲響，動搖了滿淸二百七十年的統一江山，繼之而起的便是各省紛紛響應，宣佈獨立，沒有到三個月的時間，竟將根深蒂固的君主制度推翻，使一個四千年的古老帝國轉生爲一個中國人民的新邦。在人類歷史上，這眞是一件罕有的大事。中華民族的兒女們，逢到這新中國的華誕，歡欣鼓舞，熱烈慶祝，自不容說。然而，環顧今日的大環境，中華民國正在千災萬難之中，我們的心情，甚至縱欲『强顧爲歡』，也幾乎不可能的了！</p>
<p>我們的中華民國，經歷二十六年的歲月，幾乎天天在憂患災難之中，不知遭遇到多少次的狂濤駭浪，如今不僅災難未消，而反日益嚴重。我們實在對不起先烈，對不起子孫，更對不起自己！</p>
<p>以世界大局而論，中華民國在三十六年之中，會經過二次世界大戰，凡年在四十左右的國人，都記得很淸楚。在第一次大戰時，我國雖也站在協約國方面參戰，但未受到戰勝國的待遇，尤其是「山東問題」的發生，實爲我國民族的奇恥大辱。後來華府會議雖獲得合理解決，但使敵人侵略我國的野心益趨積極，未及十年而九一八事件爆發，終於導成中日之閒的全面戰爭。在第二次大戰中，幸賴我最高領袖的英明領導，堅忍不拔，終於獲得最後勝利，不僅廢除了一切不平等條約，而且一躍而爲五强之一。抗戰勝利，證明了我中華民族不僅具有外和友邦的智慧，而且擁有抵抗强暴的潛力，從此正是中國轉弱爲强昂首吐氣的機會。不料與勝利俱來的是共匪的叛亂，使國家徒擁五强之一的虛名，而國際地位並未增進，且有逐漸降低的危險。歲月蹉跎，忽已三載，勝利後的中國，不特未見建設，反而大遭破壞，民窮財盡，不堪回首。而展望國際大局，第三次世界大戰的危機迫於眉腌，萬一不幸而爆發，戰禍勢必波及；如此孱弱紊亂的中國，怎樣能應付得了未來的「原子戰爭」，「細菌戰爭」？今天我們慶祝國慶，實在不能不引此爲我國當前的隱憂。</p>
<p>再看國内局勢的演變，中華民國在這三十六年之間，可謂無時無日不在變亂之中。誕生未久，卽遭遇洪憲帝制及張勳復辟的反動，但反動勢力終究敵不過時代前進的巨輪，欲把共和復歸帝國的企圖，都失敗了。可是輾轉反復，又造成北洋軍閥專政及混戰的局面。他們自私自利，目光如豆，只知有已，不知有國，而曹錕賄選總統，則達到我國內政黑暗的頂點。因此，國民黨乃組革命政府，誓師北伐，打倒了割據各方的軍閥，統一全國。迨國民政府奠都南京，朝氣蓬勃，全國面目一新，人民都盼望三民主義的實現。但不幸內憂外患，紛起迭乘，共「一二八」淞滬之役，「七七」蘆溝橋事變，「八一三」淞滬戰爭，一幕緊接一幕，終於導成全面的抗戰。八年之間，我中華民族不知經過多少艱險，不知嘗到多少辛酸，流血流汗，艱苦抗戰的結果，表面爲勝利，而實質則全毁於共匪的叛亂。這批匪徒，以共產為號召，以搶產為行動，以清算鬥爭為藉口，以暴力專政為目標。人民在匪徒騷擾之下，已經嘗夠了燒殺刦掠的苦痛，而在匪區以外者，也因政策錯誤，生產萎縮，不但朱能安居樂業，也將呻吟於饑餓死亡的威脅之下。水深火熱，正是今天小民生活的寫照。</p>
<p>可是，我們上面儘管訴盡痛苦，呑　眼淚，依然不願流於消極，袖手旁觀。我們對於國家前途的光明，仍懷有堅强的信念。中華民國三十六年來，雖犬天在憂患之中，但其所遭遇的難關與考國，都給我們民族祖先傳下來的至大至剛的精神突破了。所謂「多難興邦」，中華民國經過千錘百鍊之後，早已成爲不可征服的民族。在我們面前，雖然荆棘滿途，困難重重，但我們決不長懼，決不退縮，仍將挺起胸膛，跨步前進。中華民國已逾而立之年，春秋鼎盛，必能克服任何困難，　造輝煌的前途。今天是她的三七華誕，以前種種譬如昨日死，以後種種譬如今日生。雖然世界大局，危機日深，國内險象，日益露骨，但是不僅不會使我門沮喪，自暴自棄，只有使我門格外振奮，加們努力。勤儉持身，戡亂建國，解人民於倒懸，奠國基於磐石，然後咬緊牙關，迎頭趕上，以應付世界未來的巨變。我們相信中華民國必能通過這一嚴重的考騐，在危難中求得出路；但這一切的責任都在今天慶祝國慶的全國國民的身上！</p>

<p>但是現代中國藝術家之作品，在各國則較少認識，此實足以影響世人對於近代中國之瞭解。在數十年來，中國美術頗有長足的進展，而能充份映射今日中國人民之思想生活，及與西方文化接觸所產生之交響。</p>
<p>余極願對美邦人土介紹汪亞塵·王少陵二敎授在積極籌備中之現代中國畫展。此畫展係經當事人與都城博物館普愛倫君合作辦理者，普君本身對於中國文化學問，具有奢名深刻之研究。</p>
<p>汪敎授係中國著名之藝術家與敎育家，任新華師範學校校長多年，近受敎育部命，派來美國考察藝術敎育。王君留美多年，專攻西洋畫，近由中央大學聘爲西畫敎職。</p>
<p>汪·王兩君受中國文物硏究會及國際文化合作協會之託，携來名家傑作百廿餘幅，以供展覽。余深信美國欣賞中國藝術之人士，必欲先睹爲快。</p>
<p>此展先在都城博物院舉行，然後將再輪赴若干城市展開，俾便美國各部份之人民，能有最多之機會，對於此種作品有直接之認識，深信兩君高尙之宗旨與辛勤之努力，能在鼓動此間人民，對於最優之近代中國畫發生有興趣之欣賞也。」</p>

<h3 id="c151">權力與威嚴 <a href="#c151" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e151" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">151</a></h3>
<p>— 靖文</p>
<p>在報紙讀這幾天來的巴黎會議新聞，實在感到有趣。有許多人在祖心第三次世界大戰或許將由此而爆發，但我對此却一如亭利·羅斯一流人見解一樣的滑頭，卽戰事雖極有「可能」，然而恐又「未必」。看到英外相貝文的那篇鋒芒畢露的演說，以及維辛斯基的反唇相議，確令人爲戰爭一事捏一把汗；然而再看到美國代表奧斯丁與維辛斯基拍肩歡笑的照片，你幾疑心他們是在夏樂宮開鷄尾酒會。</p>
<p>國際外交，說起來自然是神聖非凡，一曾之失，往往會招到意想不到的重大結果，尤其是像這次的聯合國大會，出席代表，多爲各國行政首長，他們嘆一口氣，發一聲笑，都會變成世界電訊的大標題。和戰之局，可能在他們一舉手一擊桌之間決定。豈僅神聖，關係實亦重大異常。</p>
<p>然而國際會議代表的身份雖然十分重要，他們畢竟仍舊是血肉之福的人，他們有感情，也有常識，甚至不乏幽默。本談過去卽曾刊載過各國代表在會塲的特寫鏡頭，醫如其代表喜歡在會塲中速寫人像，某代表酷好寫詩，某代表善劃曲綫等等。如果透過他們的代表身份看，實無異於課堂中的一羣小學生。</p>
<p>要是說我們這個世界的命遝就決定在這輩人手中，似乎太不可思議了。而事實則又不能否認此點。寫到這裏，我不禁聯想起托爾斯泰在其「戰爭與和平」一書中所描寫的拿破侖。拿翁私底下的生活是非常浪漫的，上戰塲前猶得灑香水。以他那樣人物居然能率領三軍，連破德奧英俄，榮居帝座，亦堪稱是歷史上的奇蹟了。然而在滑鐵盧一役之後，一世之雄固安在哉，拿翁還不是變成了一個平凡的戰俘嗎？</p>
<p>人的重要與否，實與一個人的本身無關，對於政治家更其如此。政治家的所以顯得重要，無非是他們的地位所授予的權力。人一有了地位與權力，縱使他還想努力保持他本來的人的面目，亦往往不大可能的。朋友見面每說某某人現在得勢了，從前一起啃五香豆嚼花生米的親熱情形，現在不可復得，此時往見，不僅須先投名片，且見了面亦不過唯唯諾諾一番。於是大家都說某人得勢之後「勢利」了。但我却很能瞭解這種人，其人在骨子裹還是某人，祗是他的地位與權力不得不使你我和他之間隔了一層屏障，要沒有十分的魄力，這重屏障是不容易擺脫的。一且在他失去地位與權力之後，他是仍舊會得回到五香豆和花生米的夥伴中來的。</p>
<p>使權力與地位成爲個人不可擺脫之束縛者，是卽所謂威嚴。威嚴之來，實起於人對事物外像之錯覺。譬如一所跳舞塲決不會使人發生威嚴之念，但若一旦改成莊嚴的會塲，則身臨其間的人，不由的會發生一種沉重的感覺，而威嚴之感，亦卽油然而生。現在巴黎會議所在地的夏樂宮，原是一個博物館，莊嚴有之，成嚴恐未必。但一旦改作國際會塲，再加上進出其間的盡是當代世界具有最高權力與地位的人物，如何能不顯得威嚴。</p>
<p>咸嚴旣易造成人的沉重心情，再加上參與其間的人各有各的權力與地位背景，在如此環境下而欲求作輕快的和平談判，誠乎其爲難矣。蓋心理上的矜持，早成和衷共濟的陣礙，如果偶逢言語衝突，其不成僵局者亦幾希。我們中國人就一向注意折衝杯酒之間的外交術，西方人的鷄尾酒會，與此相近。如果將來重大的國際會議能在「乾杯乾杯」聲中進行，而將權力，地位，以及隨此俱來的威嚴看得淡薄些，世界和平庶幾有望。</p>
<p>沖淡權力，地位與咸嚴的觀念，求之當事人難而旁觀者易，因爲當事人身在舞台。「緊台型」的觀念極難打破；反之，在台下的觀衆若能對「劇情」看得平淡些，不必拍手呌好或喝倒彩，則台上人旣易下來，自亦用不到假戲眞做，動甚麼眞刀　槍。我們這個世界現在就宛似一座舞合，戲是在做，但至今還是假戲，祇求各方觀衆能放鬆一步，則眞刀信槍的局面必可避免。</p>

<p>— 翼君</p>
<p>我的住處在閘北，工作地點却在南市，每天早晨從閘北到南市，每天下午從南市回閘北，都要乘二路乙的公共汽車。說起乘公共汽車，就需要幾種太領了，那就是：忍耐，抵抗，和敏捷。</p>
<p>顧名思義，公共汽車不是獨有私車，所以不能隨時有，須到站恭候。在等候的當兒，你須有忍耐心；等一兩分鐘車就到，那是幸運，等五分鐘一刻鐘才來，運氣也還不壞；但等半個鐘頭，四五十分鐘的時候也有的，那就倒霉了。但是你得忍耐——呌，跳，急，罵，是沒用的。</p>
<p>等車的不止你一個，越等人越多，所以車來了，固是一大喜，上車時却是一大緊急關頭：車未停而人己團團國住，把守車門，車上的人未及下車，寧下的人已劍拔弩張，準備衝鋒陷陣了。看誰敏捷，誰就先上。同時你得有抵抗力，你要能穩如泰山，有磐石之固，才不致被別人擠開。你的背部腰部，須能抵抗別人的拳頭，胳膊，膝蓋骨的壓力，你的腳要準備接受別人的踐踏。有隙卽乘，無孔不入，看你是否有這麼敏捷。</p>
<p>上了車，就好了嗎？不，你還得忍耐。沒有位子，站着；人壓在你身上，手蓋在你頭上，或圈住了你的頭頸，也只好忍耐，也只好抵抗。大家擠作一團，軋在一堆，車開了時的推推撞撞，碰碰跌跌，那是不用說了，有時快車急停，全車的人猛向同一方向倒去，這「災難」可受不了。車內的炭酸氣產量豐富，咳嗽的人也不甘示弱，表演精彩，還有那吐痰的，大顯神通，口一張，嗖的一聲，一口痰，如流星，如飛彈，或如劍客之白光，早從你頭上　越而過，到窗外去了。但痰從頭上過時，一定有些零星唾沫，大珠小珠落你頭，或沾君而；這，你也得忍耐。因爲，像這類的人不一而足，你若干涉他，他也不老實，是要「以眼還眼，以牙還牙」的。旣然咳的咳，吐的吐，自然細菌紛飛，各尋宿主；所以，你的身體得有抵抗力，而後可免感染疾病。</p>
<p>坐在你面前的人，老不下車，以致沒有空位，你得忍耐。有空位了，你得敏捷，方可搶到位子。位子而未能搶到，你還得忍耐。</p>
<p>這情形一點也不誇張。我知道，電車因爲容積大情形好些，我乘的是公共汽車，是二路公共汽車，而又是有個「乙」字的二路公共汽車，車子是出奇的少，所以這情形是無一次例外的，眞正沒有一次例外。沒有「乙」字的二路公共汽車情形便較好了，因車子的數目較多，最值得稱頌的是虬江路站的排隊上車，表現着井然的秩序。</p>
<p>我因爲天天乘二路乙公共汽車，學會了三大本領：忍耐·抵抗·敏捷。</p>

<p>高郵王懷祖先生（念孫）爲有淸一代樸學大師，其所著「讀書雜誌」巳可不朽。乃其手校典籍則罕見。余於民國三十四年七月竟於蘇州松石齊得其手校一焦氏易林」，原書爲汲古閣「津逮秘書」本。書賈初不語爲誰氏校筆，余諦視有「高郵王氏藏書印」，「淮海世家」兩大方印，審爲懷祖先生舊藏。書中朱墨兼施，據唐宋類書「酉陽雜俎」曁吾邑陸貽典先生易林校宋本詳校，博大精審，不似僅僅以藏書名家者所爲。其筆跡與南京龍蟠里國學圖書館所藏懷祖先生所校「宋保說本諧聲補逸」絕相似，證以「說文系統圖」王氏墨跡亦酷肖。因知是乃王氏手校，了無疑義矣。余竟以賤值得之，謂非厚幸歟？余平生於舊籍頗有眼福，惟以家貧不能蓄爲己有，等若雲煙之過眼。惟昔年曾以微值得盧抱經手校「輟耕錄」殘本，足與此媲美。得瑕當移錄其校語，以示世之治樸學者。松石齋主人張叟已於今春去世，追念昔日對坐談藝之樂，如同隔世。余亦離吳門返里，訪書之興大減，善本亦不恒見，書此以誌前塵夢影可耳</p>

<p>民國元年雙十節，本報自由談有一紀念文日：「今日何日乎？乃中華民國之第一國慶日也。彩旗高樹，舉國若狂，然細察國事，有感於心。言內政則意見紛歧，操戈同室；言外交則列強虎視，承認無期；言財政則司農仰屋，羅掘供窮；言軍事則消納無方，頻驚風鶴；而閭閻無愛國之意，邊疆多不軌之徒。大地瘡痍，那堪回首；前途荊棘，能不傷心！值此紀念之期，更有無窮之嘆，安能強從流俗，而爲幕燕之歡娛乎？一雖事渦境遷，然除「承認」云云外，似仍可作爲今年雙十節之感言。</p>
<p>又，民國元年雙十節，國父在上海參加寰球中國學生會舉行之國慶紀念會。當發表演講，有云：」……但民國雖成立，而今尚在危險時代，內亂未靖，外患頻仍，譬之建造大廈，基礎已立，尚待建築，願吾同胞自今以後，亦須有冒險心，堅忍心，協力贊助政府，以造成地球上頭等大國，是鄙人深望於諸君者也……</p>
<p>鈔報旣畢，不禁喟然　但願不要「後之視今，亦猶今之視昔！一</p>
<p>###</p>
<p>孔子「三月不知肉味」，若在北平巡行街巷，尤其秋冬兩季數月之問，則處處皆是肉味。此地水土厚重缺水，故魚蝦各味遠不及南方之鮮美，惟肉食尤其羊肉之肥嫩幾澤，及數百年研究之做法，實爲全國所無。以「西口羊」來自塞外者爲上品，其做法則「醬」，「涮」，「烤一爲三絕。「醬」者，以羊肉質亘中，加香家資老名大，故價特昂而生意轉茂。「烤」者，以大鐵篦，置爐火上，將肉切薄片，拌香料醬汕等，使食客自以鐵义，义而烤之，熟卽入口，鮮銀異常，以西城一宛姓者爲最有名，北城亦有一家，趨者若驚，每須排隊候缺，如擠兌然。而食時架腿張臂，功架如武生演技，張口如餓虎　食，可笑可觀，雖　登男女亦成羣逐隊，大义火烤，大嚼大吞，紅樓夢之「脂粉香娃，割腥啖羶」頗相彷彿。「涮」者，以火鍋熾炭於中，火猛湯沸，預以羊肉切成薄片，入沸湯片刻成熟，耶取出入小碗巳備醬酒及各香料者，拌合食之，濃郁肥甘，嗜者極衆。而凡業以上各種，又故將肉及鍋爐等陣列於門外，以刀又烹割熱烈飽騰之象為宣傳，古代所謂「酒池肉林」，可於故都秋冬季得其印象。</p>
<p>牛羊肉在平市難盛，而猪肉仍爲肉之正宗。肉爲一切肉之總名，又爲猪肉之專屬，若說牛羊肉，例須指明牛羊，若單提「肉」字，皆知爲猪矣。鷄鴨亦肉，但又不費「肉」。菜館之雞絲鴨片，不須說鷄肉絲鴨肉片也，恰與猪之只提肉者相反，亦屬可笑。現在北平猪肉非黑市不能得。牛羊鵝鴨則尚可得之於市，生牛羊肉亦不多，鷄鴨雖多而價奇昂，且老瘦劣貨，每隻動需金圓五六元，所謂限價幾角，商人置之不理，亦無人過問</p>
<p>詩人曰：「可以食無肉，不可居無竹一，「肉」以捧「竹」，居住以「竹」爲要素，則「肉」爲食之要素亦可見矣。四書上說「子在齊聞韶，三月不知肉味」，借「肉」以　韶樂，而「肉」之身分亦不爲低矣。議諷官僚者言「肉食者鄙」，以「肉食」表徵「豪門顯宦」，正與「朱門酒肉臭，路有凍死骨」同一意義。不但中國，西俗尤甚，觀於戰時節約，特定每週幾個「無肉日」，配糧還不及配給「牛肉一磅」「牛油半磅」來得起勁，全世界正是「肉世界」！</p>
<p>儒者日：「君子　　廚。」又曰：「聞其聲不忍食其肉。「佛家以戒殺生爲人類之福，現在殺機遍於全球，相殘相噬，生民浩刧，生命幾同兒戲，巢無完卵，淵無恬麟，人之異於牛羊鷄豕者幾何？黃巢張獻忠之道大行矣。</p>

<p>— 翁文灝</p>
<p>十月十日國慶日，在我們全國國民思想上富具最可紀念的價值，我們試想，在民國建元之前，中國承數千年的帝　控制，一切帝制朝廷的官吏依然猶在，專爲壓制國民而設的軍隊訓練有素，裝備頗良，而在主張革命的方面，資金甚窘，武裝缺乏，雙方互相比較，物質强弱，相差極多，雖然無疑，但是革命領袖抱定了熱誠救國的決心，不畏艱危，百折不撓，發揮勇猛前進的精神，奮勵發動，有進無退，拚命的作爲，卒能在武昌一舉成功，開創了民國的始基。</p>
<p>那時，上海方面奮然改革制起人心，許多省份同聲答應，全國人民共知帝制不能存，民國必須建立，只此國民大多數的信念，其堅如鋼，使滿淸的文武官員　　危懼，有軍械而不敢用，有權力而不生效，相率逃亡，遂致完全失敗。</p>
<p>可見民國建立的原因，在物質上看，正是以弱握強，以貧敗富，在心理上講，實是以直勝曲，以新換舊，而且將物質的實力與心理的信念，互相比較，實是信心戰勝了物力，這個是歷史上一個極有價値的事實。</p>
<p>這種無堅不摧的信心是什麽呢，那時大多數國民接受了革命領袖的領導，大家深信滿淸朝廷腐敗昏庸是害國的根源，帝皇制度子孫傳授，是落伍的制度，要救國家必須革新。大家追憶甲午戰後，外患頻仍，中國非自强不能自立，又追憶庚子拳亂，魯莾滅裂，中國非革新不能自强，在此信念之下，一經發動，萬衆一心，遂成爲創造民國的基本力量</p>
<p>「周雖舊邦，其命維新，」我國的新命實全賴此精誠向上的信念，這種信心也是我們對日長期抗戰的主因，當時在九一八東北淪陷之後，日太侵略，由東北而華北，更由華北而華中，蠶食鯨呑，繼進不已，我國領土主權都受重大威脅，歐美友邦都只求自保，對我國並無援助的諾言，日强我弱，形勢顯然，但是我國的領袖，卽現任總統蔣公毅然決定武力抗戰，全國一致擁護，風起雲湧，戮力同心，準備長期的戰爭，以求取最後的勝利，歷年努力，歷盡艱辛，生活雖苦而精神不衰，卒使歐美各國共爲欽敬，聯合實力，共起戰爭，迫使日本投降。我國五十年來所失的土地台灣以及東北一律收回，復歸版籍，這是一個顯例，證明國民的信心，終能達到目的，有志竟成，絕對可靠。</p>
<p>深可感歎的是國步多艱，八年抗戰取得勝利之後，又有共產黨的擾亂，仍使條烟四起，民不聊生，上次我爲明辯是非，共赴國難，已經切實說明中國共產黨自從創立以來，始終是假借名義，破壞摧殘，成爲動搖國計民生的根本大患，我國戡亂工作之必要，決不下於辛亥革命及對日抗戰，從前革命及抗戰，都因大家深切的信念而取得勝利，克吿成功，目前戡亂的勝負關鍵，亦全在我們充份堅實我們必勝必成的信念。</p>
<p>目前實際的困難，自屬特爲重大，但將此時形勢與革命及抗戰的初期互相比較，則我們政府的組織，軍隊的裝備，金融的力量，以及交通的便利，都遠在從前之上，從前能勝，今日決不能敗。我所關心的是國民心理必須澈底明識是非與利害，切不可爲共產黨的宣傳所移動，須要精誠團結，一致淮行，不可矛盾吹求，减少了自身的實力，更要堅決自信，毫無猶疑，不可問道於盲，接受了對方的誑言。當此雙十國慶的日子，我願全國同胞共同自勉，勿忘從前的忠勇熱誠，而怠忽了今天重要的時代任務。</p>

<p>五十彈推翻滿清</p>
<p>武昌起義是倉卒發動的，事先各種準備及聯絡並不充分，但結果終吿成功，由此可見民心之所趨。民國十三年，，總理在黄埔軍校開學；訓詞中有云：</p>
<p>當時在武昌·漢口的革命黨總共還不過三百人，眞正革命黨不過幾十人，所有的槍，都沒有子彈，臨時到處搜索，只有兩盤子彈，一共不過五十粒。革命黨分到到了五十粒子彈，便在城內的工程營内發難，城外的砲兵營立即響應。……革命黨只用幾十個人去打兩萬多人，可說是用一個人去打五百個人……。」</p>
<p>按首先發難的城內工程營，爲第八營左隊熊秉坤部，其時彭楚藩，劉堯徵，楊宏勝三烈士被瑞徵捕殺，在軍隊中的黨人深恐事露，人人戒備，而機關已被破獲，名册被檢，無法再待一切準備就緒再行發動，乃卽倉卒起事。不料槍聲一響，各軍無不響應，滿吏立卽抱頭鼠竄而逃，並未遇到若何阻難，而中華民國，亦由此創造了。</p>
<p>清亡讖語的故事</p>
<p>武漢起義成功後，袁世凱奉淸廷之命，率師南下。袁甚爲迷信，行前曾請術士卜此行凶吉，術士謂大吉，乃行。湖北軍政府爰致書袁氏，勸其勿爲淸室作倀，亦以占卜之理說之，甚　興趣，亦民國開國史中談助也。原書頗畏，茲節錄數節於後：</p>
<p>「……聞公此次受滿朝之命而南下也，（按當指九月十一日南下督師事）堅辭者再，遲疑審顧者三，重以阮忠樞，廕冒之敦促，猶不遽決，而復召某術士占之，占士謂此行必立大業，而後公始發程。術夫士之言，原無價値，公殆於惠得患失之餘而曲聽之。在公雖具英雄籠罩之妙用，然固不若古人占三從二之爲得也。是則公果占今日四百兆衆人心之背向，更應恍悟所謂大業，當在中華民國，而不在垂滅之滿朝矣。</p>
<p>公誠以占候緯鐵家　爲可信乎？則吾口國流傳之歌謠古讖爲前知之民所推定，其騐顯有正應於今日者，公曷不一省察耶？如云「手執鋼刀九十九，　盡　人方罷手」者，公知作何解乎？吾儕始亦不得其解，及經前月二十一日滿朝之電旨，其中忽有「革黨」二字出現，吾儕之巧者，加以指點，始恍然於稽驗之有在。蓋「革」字固九筆，而「黨」字則十九筆，此卽所謂「九十九』也。胡運告終，不於此而益見耶？又如「繼統偏安三十六，旗分八面到秦州」，亦秘讖語也。今日亦復有人爲之判決矣。蓋「統」之爲宣統，人所知也。「偏安三十六」謂其偏能安居三十六月，卽爲胡連吿終於宣統三年之明兆。「三十六」卽三年之變言也。「旗分八面」謂八旗離散，「秦州』之「秦」非關中也。今關中平爲中華民國所有，安能復駐庚子之蹕。蓋「秦」字乃奉天二字之不完全之象形，謂彼滿君終當流離於此主權不完全之奉天也，連日北京來信，有滿常后將出奔奉天消息，詎非兆之前定者乎？然此秘籙，初非吾儕所願主張以愚民者，不過聞公近信緯讖，故聊貫之以博一粲，且以明故歷應終之一證耳。</p>
<p>「然上云云，絕非吾人此次舉義之原因，以公惑於　祥，息得惠失，故不惜破例爲公一言。冀公早知天命有歸，或不致妄遑智計之私，蒙蔽終生，墮入失身書衆之惡罪，此關某等　爲覺公之　意也。…」</p>

<p>（一）興中會會章</p>
<p>興中會於民國紀元前十八年（一八九四）創立於檀香山，爲中國革命的最早團體。當時立有會章十條，揭示其性質與宗旨，大要如下：</p>
<p>一·會名宜正也本會名曰「興中會，總會設在中國，分會設各地。</p>
<p>二·本旨宜明也　會之設，專爲連絡中外有志華人，講求富强之學，以振興中華，維持國體起見。蓋中國今日政治日非，綱維日壞，强鄰輕侮百姓，其原因皆由衆心不一，祗圖目前之私，不顧畏久大局。不思中國，且爲人分裂，則子子孫孫，世爲奴隸，身家性命不保，急莫急於此！而舉國憤憤，無人悟之，無人挽之！聯智愚爲一心，合遐邇爲一德，羣策羣力，投大遺艱：則中國雖危，庶可救挽，所謂民爲邦本，本固邦寗也。</p>
<p>三·志向宜定也　本會擬定事務，須利國益民，方能行之：以期上匡國家，以臻隆治；下維黎庶，以絕苛殘。必使吾中國四百兆生民，各得其所，方爲滿志。倘有藉端舞弊，結黨行私；或畛域互分，彼此歧視，皆非本會志向：宜痛絕之，以　公，而杜流弊。</p>
<p>四·人員宜得也　本會按年公舉辦理人員一次，務擇品學兼優，才能通達者。</p>
<p>五·交友宜擇也本會收接會友，務由舊會友二人引薦，經董事祭其心地光明，確具忠義，有心愛載其父母邦，維持中國，以臻强盛之地。</p>
<p>六·支會宜廣也四方有志之士，皆可仿照章程，隨處自行立會。</p>
<p>七·人才宜集也　本會需材孔亟，會友散處四方，自當隨時隨地，物色賢材，無論中外人士，倘有心益世，肯爲中國盡力，皆得收於會中。</p>
<p>八。的款宜籌也本會所理各事，事體重大，需款浩繁。故特設銀會，以資鉅集，用濟公家之急，兼爲股友生財捷徑，一舉兩得，誠善舉也。</p>
<p>九·公所宜設也各處支會當設一公所，爲會員辦公之處；及使各友時到叙談，講求興中良法，討論當今時事，考硏各國政治，各抒己見，互勉進益；不得在此博奕遊戲，曁行一切無益之事。</p>
<p>十·變通宜善也以各款爲本會開辦之大綱。各會支會中隨地變通，別立規條務令妥善。</p>
<p>（二）同盟會成立記</p>
<p>同盟會於民國紀元前七年成立於日本東京。其成立經過，據田桐在「太平雜誌」一卷一期所作「同盟會之成立一一文所記，略爲：</p>
<p>乙已年夏，孫公將來日本，同人歡動。抵横濱後，復由程家權傳吿。東京學生，往來京濱之間者甚夥，孫公禮賢下士，復留餐宿，自捧面盆盥客。東京留學生復開歡迎會於富士見樓，到者甚衆，席中演說共和政體，吳崑筆述，　學生受太　動，掌聲如雷。旋開同盟預備會於飯田町程家權萬宅，到八九人，商量各事及會名，孫公主張定名「中國革命黨」，黄公以此名一出，黨員行動不便，討論後，定名爲「中國同盟會」，誓約格式如下；</p>
<p>立誓約人某某省某某府某某縣某某某，當天發誓，驅除韃虜，恢復中華，建立民國，平均地權，矢信矢忠，有始有卒，如或渝此，任衆處罰，中國同盟會會員　某某某</p>
<p>介紹人某某某</p>
<p>天運　年　月　日</p>
<p>次日開成立會於赤坂區檜町，内田良平之宅，到會者四十餘人，公衆皆歡舞，忽有湘人張明夷以定名不當，謂旣抱傾覆滿廷之志，當爲對象立名。孫曰，不必也，滿洲政府腐敗，我輩所以革命，卽令滿人同情於我，亦可許其入黨。曹亞伯起曰，今日大家主張革命，始來此間，如有異議，何必來，兄弟憑良心首先簽名，衆皆和之，各書誓約一紙。是日天氣炎熱，爲舊曆六月廿四日，新曆七月下旬也。內田僕婦持凉糕進，同人飽啖之。歡笑之中，草席枕木，折其一焉。杯盤爲傾，同人有倒臥者，孫公曰，此爲傾覆滿洲政府之朕兆也，衆豫樂。推黄興蔣尊簋程家權馬君武等人爲起草員，孫公當然參與之。章程大旨，取三權分立，（一）執行部，由總理統率治事，內分庶務部，書記部，内務部，外務部，會計部，經理部。（二）評議部，由議員互選議長，由議長指定議員一人爲書記。（三）司法部，總長一人，判事二人，檢事一人。（四）各省分會，置分會長一人。越數日，在靈南阪子爵阪本金彌宅，開幹部選舉會，黄公提　察同人之意，總理一席，屬意孫公，可省手續，不必投票，衆如義，孫公爲總理，黄公爲庶務。其餘執行部人員，乃次第成立，有經選舉者，有未經選舉者。評議部議員一次全部選出，司法部及各省分會會長亦半後選出焉。</p>
<p>（三）宣統皇帝遜位詔</p>
<p>朕欽奉隆裕太后懿旨，前因民軍起事，各省響應，九夏沸騰，生靈塗炭。特命袁世凱遺員，與民國代表討論大局，議開國會，公決政體。二月以來，尙無確當辦法。南北睽隔，彼此相持，商輟於途，士露於野，徒以國體一日不決，故民生一日不安。今全國人民心理，多傾向共和，南中各省，旣倡議於前，北方各將，亦主張於後，人心所向，天命可知。予亦何忍以一姓之尊榮，拂兆人之好惡，是用外觀大勢，内審與情，特率皇帝將統治權歸全國，定爲共和立憲國體，近慰海内厭亂望治之心，遠涉古聖天下爲公之義。袁世凱前經資政院選　爲總理大臣，當茲新舊代謝之際，宜有南北統一之方，卽由袁世凱組織臨時政府，與民軍協商統一辦法，總期人民安堵，海内又安，仍合漢滿蒙回藏五族，完全傾土，爲一大中華民國。予與皇帝得以退處寬閑，優遊歲月，長受國民之優禮，親見郅治之吿成，豈不懿歟？欽此！</p>
<p>右諭頒布日期，爲宣統三年十二月廿五日，卽中華民國元年二月五日。</p>
<p>（四）張溥泉回憶錄</p>
<p>張溥泉回憶錄云：「宣統三年一月三日，總理赴比利時。五月間，余赴倫敦，夏偕吳弼剛游瑞士，初居溫根，在仙女峯下，復移革爾梭。秋，武昌起義，法人聞中國革命，至爲興奮。余携二三友人步行街上，衝由飯店中走出四五工人，脫帽遙呼中國萬歲，可見一般嚮日卑視華人者，亦多改態度。十一月歸國，至星洲，聞吾黨內分兩派，一同盟會，一光復會，乃集兩派人會飲，曉以大義。其要旨當革命成功之日，所忌同志之內訌。到上海聞漢口我軍失利，形勢甚危。不久，總理由海外歸，士氣大振。余在某戲園講演，募革命軍款，婦女在兩廂者皆脫金銀首飾，擲於台上，可見人心之振奮。英士爲籌款計，一日集湖州富商於某會館，閉門，非出錢不可。英士命余演說。」</p>
<p>（五）臨時大總統告友邦書</p>
<p>溯自滿人入主，據無上之威權，施非理之抑勒，裁制民權，抗違公意，我中華民國之智識上，道德上，生計上種種之進步，坐是遲緩不前。識者謂非實行革命不足以蕩滌舊汚，振作新機。今幸義旗軒舉，大局垂定，吾中華民國全體，用敢以推倒滿淸專制政府，建設共和民國，布吿於我諸友邦。</p>
<p>易君主政體以共和，此非吾人徒逞一朝之憤也。天賦自由，縈想已夙，祈悠久之幸福，掃前途之障蔽，懷此微忱，久而莫達。今日之事，蓋自然發生之結果，亦卽吾民國公意所由正式發表者也。</p>
<p>蓋吾中華民族，和平守法，根於天性，非出於自衛之不得已，決不肯輕啓戰端。故自滿淸盜竊中國，於今地百六十有八年，其間虐政，罄竹難書，吾民族惟有隱忍受之，初不欲見流血之慘也。　起屢蹶，卒難達吾人之目的，至於今日，實已忍無可忍，是用訴之武力，冀脫吾人及世世子孫於萬重覊軛，自由幸福，照耀寰宇，不可謂非千載難得之盛會也。</p>
<p>滿淸政府之政策，質言之，一嫉視異種，自私自便，百折不變之虐政而已。吾人受之旣久，追而出於革命，亦固其所。摧陷舊制，建立新國，誠有所不得不然，謹爲世界諸自由民族縷晣陳之。</p>
<p>當滿清未竊神器之先，諸夏文明之邦，實許世界各國以交通往來，及宣布敎旨之自由。有明失政，滿夷入主，本其狹隘之心胸，自私之僻見，設爲種種政令，固閉自封，不令中土文明，與世界各邦相接觸，遂使神明之裔，日趨僿野，天賦知能，艱於發展，愚民自錮，此不獨人道之魔障，抑亦文明各國之公敵歟？</p>
<p>不特此也，滿淸政府欲使多數漢人永遠屈服於其專制之下，而彼得以擁有財富封殖繁育於其間，遂不恤賊害吾民，以圖自利：宗支近系，時擁特權，多數平民，聽其支配。又復徵苛細不法之賦稅，任意取求，迹鄰擄刦。阻國内商務之發展，妨殖產工業之繁興，則滿洲政府不知獎護實業之過也。</p>
<p>至於用人行政，更無大公不易之常規。嚴刑峻制，慘無人理。賣官鬻爵，政以賄成。朝頒詔旨，夕卽背之，玩弄吾民，已非一次。坐令吾國吾民，遭世界之輕視，而彼殆無動於中焉。</p>
<p>吾人今欲湔除上述種種之罪惡，俾吾中華民國得與世界各邦敦平之睦誼，故不恤捐棄生命，與惡政府戰，而別建一良好者代之。故披瀝陳於各邦之前，我各友邦尙垂鑒之。中華民國臨時大一總統係文（簽名）。</p>

<p>黎元洪出山之謎</p>
<p>武昌旣爲民軍佔領，革命黨人乃在諮議局商組軍政部並推舉都督，但以事起倉卒，有資望的黨人如劉仲文，劉英，黄克强，居正等皆不在武昌，各軍領袖又聲望太淺，不能號召，而形勢緊迫，又未便長時羣能無首，乃舉非革命黨人的二十一混成協協統「好好先生」黎元洪爲都督。黎之出山，並非出於自願。據文公直之「中華民國開國史』及鄒魯之『中國國民黨史稿」等，皆謂黎係黨人　濟民在黎宅床下挾出者；張難先之「湖北革命知之錄』，謂係馬榮，湯啓發在黎之參謀劉文吉家臥室中搜出者。惟英人丁格（Edwin　J　Dingle）在所作「CHina's　Revolution　1911-1912」一書中，謂：「中國革命在世界史上，是最駭人聽聞的劃時代事件之一，如果目前全世界人人皆知的黎元洪，當時不在的話，也許革命就不會爆發。歷史證明，只有黎元洪是中國及世界上最偉大的改革家？……」云云，不知此君是不明事實，抑或故意歪曲。因關於此事，黎元洪本人事後曾有一函致薩鎭冰，中有云·</p>
<p>「洪當武昌變起之時所部各軍皆已出防，空營獨守，束手無策，黨軍驅逐瑞督出城後，卽率隊來洪營，合圍搜索，洪換便衣匿室後，當被索執。責以大義，其時槍砲環列，萬一不從，卽身首異處，洪祗得權爲應允，吾師素知洪最謹厚，何敢倉猝出此。……」</p>
<p>由此可知黎本人亦承認當時曾「便衣匿室後」，至於說是從床下拖出來，則或是後人的過甚其辭，亦未可知。</p>
<p>國號與國璽史話</p>
<p>辛亥光復後，黨人對於民國的正式命名，意見頗爲紛紜，有主張定爲「大漢國」，有主張定爲「大漢民國」，此皆是從「大淸帝國」四字變化而來。也有人主張定爲「中華共和國」。至參議院成立，乃將「中華民國」之稱號確定。</p>
<p>最早提出「中華民國」之名者，爲章太炎先生。章曾在民報撰一文，題曰「中華民國」解，對此四字廣徵博引，闡釋甚詳。其文略云：</p>
<p>「中國之名，別以四裔而爲言。印度亦稱摩伽陀爲中國，日本亦稱山陽爲中國，此本非漢土所獨有者。就漢土言漢土，則中國之名，以先漢郡縣爲界。……諸華之名，因其民族初至之地而爲言。世言昆侖爲華國者，特以他事比擬得之。中國前皇，曾都昆侖以否，史無明徵，不足引以爲質。然神靈之胃，自西方來，以雍梁二州爲根本。宓羲生成紀，神農產姜水，黄帝宅橋山，是皆雍州之地。高陽起於若水，高辛起於江水，舜居西城，禹生石紐，是皆梁州之地。觀其帝王所產，而知民族奧區，斯爲根極。雍州之地，東南至於華險而止；梁州之地，東北至於華陽而止。就華山以定限，名其國土日華，則緣起如是也。……」</p>
<p>可知太炎先生定名「中華」二字，「中」者對四外之異邦而言，「華」者因民族起源於華山，故以此爲建國之號云。</p>
<p>至於國央，盟爲老玩玉，文曰「中華民國之　」，高二寸七分，方廣二寸六分，延琢玉名手陸某所治，其時曾特委元帥府秘書連聲海爲造墨官，監督工作。勝利後，國府凱旋還都，吳文官長所手捧者，卽此豐也。</p>

<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 9th] Zeng Qi, a leader of the Chinese Youth Party, recently gave a speech on National Day, saying: "I have always believed that a third world war is inevitable and that a second national crisis will eventually come. Therefore, after the victory, I have repeatedly tried to persuade the people of the country with alarming and bitter words. Today, the internal and external situation is becoming increasingly serious, and my words will unfortunately be gradually confirmed. On this National Day, I would like to present my views to the people of the country for correction: (1) I have always believed that the Chinese nation is the most outstanding nation in the world. However, although its essence is excellent, its manifestations are close to decline. Without major stimulation, it cannot be awakened and excited. For example, during World War I, we disregarded Japan's constraints and resolutely participated in the European war, and finally recovered the Shandong Peninsula. This is proof of stimulation and awakening. During World War II, we fought against Japan alone for more than four years and finally mobilized the world, creating a 'democratic front' and overthrowing 'totalitarian countries.' This is another proof of stimulation and awakening. Although the Third World War has not yet broken out on the surface, we are actually standing on the front line and will inevitably endure a period of bitter struggle alone. Then, with 'the support of those who have the Tao,' we will achieve final victory. This is what I dare to assert. (2) Since national disaster is inevitable, we should prepare for a rainy day and not be discouraged by difficulties, nor should we retreat due to difficulties. In particular, we must not 'blame heaven and others,' simply attributing the blame to any person or any faction, without ourselves bearing any responsibility. This is not the attitude that modern citizens should have. I believe that there are three things that the people of the country should strive for together: (1) Enhance national self-confidence, (2) Strengthen national defense and self-defense capabilities, (3) Increase national unity. If these three things can be done, any internal and external troubles are not to be feared. I hope that the people of the country, under the leadership of the head of state, will work together on the 'non-partisan movement to save the nation and build the country,' without being negligent or reckless, but continuing to work hard, abiding by the law, being practical and realistic, reversing decline and promoting revival, and turning weakness into strength. Then, future National Days will definitely have a place where people can be sincerely happy, and will not spend this festival with a 'melancholy mood.'"</p>

<h3 id="e9">The Problem of Military Grain Supply in Northeast and North China is Resolved <a href="#e9" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c9" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">9</a></h3>
<p>Grain Deputy Chen Liang Returns to Shanghai to Speak</p>
<p>"Our Newspaper Report" Chen Liang, Deputy Minister of the Grain Department, was ordered to go to Northeast and North China to handle military grain matters. This has now come to a conclusion, and he flew from Beiping to Shanghai on the afternoon of the 8th. According to his statement to reporters: During his week in the Northeast and four or five days in North China, the problem of raising military grain in the two regions has been completely resolved. As for the solutions, the Northeast was divided into two parts: one part was to requisition, borrow, or purchase locally, and the other part was to be transported from inside the customs.

At around 10:00 in the morning, they went to the Ministry of Finance to meet with Vice Minister Xu Baiyuan and delivered the association's letter, requesting six points, the most important of which are: (1) Extend the deadline for capital increase. It is definitely impossible to complete the capital increase procedures in accordance with the Company Law within two months. Moreover, there are a total of 1,070 money houses in the country, with more than 700 in the interior. The deadline for completing the capital increase within two months is even more difficult in reality. Please give them the same six-month deadline as ordinary industrial and commercial enterprises. (2) Request the government to consider the economic environment in various regions and reduce the minimum limit for capital increase. (3) The period of three months for depositing cash for capital increase into the Central Bank should be exempted from freezing. (4) Request that the interest rate on deposits and loans not be rigidly stipulated, so that various regions can make flexible increases and decreases based on local conditions. Qin Runxiang also explained to Xu the reasons for each of the demands. The chairmen of the money industry associations in various regions reported the different situations in their respective regions. After talking for about an hour, Vice Minister Xu said that he would report the points requested by Qianlian to the Executive Yuan and discuss them with the responsible persons in the ministry. However, the general principles stipulated in the Emergency Measures for Financial and Economic Affairs may not be changed, and supplementary measures can be gradually improved as much as possible based on the actual situation. Regarding the extension of the capital increase deadline, Xu said that the two-month deadline could be calculated from the date of receipt of the document. The remaining unanswered questions will be scheduled for another meeting with the representatives at 11:00 AM on the 11th to give a concrete reply. At 4:00 PM, Qin Runqing and others went to the Executive Yuan to petition again and were received by Secretary-General Li Weiguo. Li said that President Weng had received Vice Minister Xu's report.

<h3 id="e34">Ambassador Gu, Invited by U.S. State Department, Broadcasts to the Nation; Explains American Sentiment Towards China, Reviews Aid to China; Emphasizes Importance of Self-Help and Reform <a href="#e34" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c34" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">34</a></h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, New York, 9th] On the eve of our National Day, our Ambassador to the United States, Gu Weijun, at the invitation of the U.S. State Department, broadcast to the people of our country on the "Voice of America" radio station in New York, explaining the sentiment of Americans towards China and reviewing the entire issue of aid to China. Gu stated that if China fully utilizes American aid and engages in reform with a spirit of self-help, then American aid will surely continue to flow in. Gu emphasized that self-help and reform are the basic conditions for continuing to seek American aid. He said that China, under the leadership of President Chiang and the government, is gradually engaging in various reforms, such as military reform, monetary reform, and rural reform. This reform has attracted the attention and sympathy of the United States. The United States hopes that we will continue to work hard, because such reform can not only benefit China at present, but also serve as good debating material for our American friends when the U.S. Congress discusses foreign aid again next year. American officials have gradually understood the problem of the Chinese Communist Party. He told American leaders in both the government and the public that the Chinese Communist Party is the largest Communist group outside of the Soviet Union. China's current problems are even more serious than those of Greece and Eastern and Western European countries. If China becomes communist, then other East Asian countries, including Japan, cannot hope to avoid becoming vassal states of the Communist Party. Regarding the American view of the Chinese situation, Gu said that the American people are all friendly to China and are both concerned and sympathetic to China's prosperity. The various bills of the U.S. Congress and the aid to China plan passed this year are definite manifestations of this sympathy. However, the distance between China and the United States is vast, and the American people still lack an adequate understanding of the actual situation in China. The Ambassador said that in the past few years, the international propaganda promoted by the Chinese Communist Party in the United States has been the most active. The narrow views of those who promote Chinese communism are not only supported by countless American Communists and Communists from other countries, but also assisted by American leftists. They make one-sided reports or irresponsible criticisms of the political, economic, and military situation in China, and some American people are inadvertently affected by this malicious propaganda. Fortunately, most leaders of the American government and Congress understand the international nature of Communist Party activities and are also able to understand China's position, goals, and difficulties. Under their leadership, the broad masses of the American people are gradually understanding the major relationship between China's suppression of the Communist Party and world peace, and are further advocating assisting China in the arduous task of suppressing rebellion and building the country. Because of this American understanding, the aid to China plan was realized. Gu said that although the aid to China plan is very helpful to China, its amount cannot be compared with the aid to Europe plan and cannot meet China's needs. American friends who are concerned about China's problems also share this feeling, but believe that the passage of the aid to China plan by the United States, especially its military assistance, is sufficient to reflect the U.S. recognition of the threat posed by the Chinese Communist Party. Gu emphasized that if China can fully utilize the current U.S. economic and military assistance, and especially implement reforms with a spirit of self-help, then the United States will surely continue to aid China. The Ambassador then hoped that all compatriots in the country would fully cooperate with the government to strengthen the suppression of rebellion, and said that without the elimination of the Communist threat, China will have no peaceful unification to speak of, nor can it achieve full freedom and complete independence.</p>

<h3 id="e36">A Message on the 37th National Day <a href="#e36" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c36" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">36</a></h3>
<p>The National Day of the Republic of China in its thirty-seventh year has arrived again in a season of clear skies, crisp air, gentle breezes, and bright sunshine. Recalling this day thirty-six years ago, a cannon blast from the engineering battalion within Wuchang City shook the 270-year-old unified empire of the Manchu Qing Dynasty. What followed was the successive response and declaration of independence by various provinces. In less than three months, the deeply rooted monarchical system was overthrown, transforming an ancient empire of four thousand years into a new nation for the Chinese people. In human history, this is truly a rare and momentous event. It goes without saying that the sons and daughters of the Chinese nation are filled with joy and enthusiasm as they celebrate this birthday of the new China. However, looking at the current environment, the Republic of China is amidst a myriad of calamities and difficulties. Our mood, even if we try to "force a smile," is almost impossible!</p>
<p>Our Republic of China, having experienced twenty-six years of life, has been in worry and disaster almost every day. We have encountered countless storms and turbulent waves, and now not only have the disasters not subsided, but they are becoming increasingly serious. We are truly letting down the martyrs, letting down our descendants, and even more so, letting down ourselves!</p>
<p>Looking at the overall world situation, the Republic of China has gone through two world wars in the past thirty-six years. Those around the age of forty clearly remember the events. During the First World War, although our country also stood on the side of the Allied Powers and participated in the war, we were not treated as a victorious nation. In particular, the occurrence of the "Shandong Problem" was truly a national humiliation for our Chinese nation. Later, although the Washington Conference achieved a reasonable solution, it made the enemy's ambitions to invade our country even more active. In less than ten years, the September 18th Incident broke out, eventually leading to a full-scale war between China and Japan. During the Second World War, thanks to the wise leadership and unwavering perseverance of our supreme leader, we finally achieved final victory. We not only abolished all unequal treaties, but also jumped to become one of the five great powers. The victory of the War of Resistance proved that our Chinese nation not only possesses the wisdom to harmonize with friendly nations abroad, but also possesses the potential to resist violence. From then on, China had the opportunity to transform from weakness to strength and to hold its head high with pride. Unexpectedly, what came with victory was the rebellion of the communist bandits, which made the country possess only the empty name of one of the five great powers, while its international status did not increase and even ran the risk of gradually declining. Time has slipped away, and three years have suddenly passed. The China after victory has not only not seen construction, but has instead been greatly damaged. The people are impoverished, and the finances are exhausted. It is unbearable to look back. Looking ahead at the international situation, the crisis of a third world war is imminent. If it unfortunately breaks out, the war will inevitably spread. How can such a weak and chaotic China cope with the future "atomic war" and "germ warfare"? Today, as we celebrate National Day, we really cannot help but cite this as a hidden worry for our country's current situation.</p>
<p>Looking at the evolution of the domestic situation, the Republic of China can be said to have been in chaos and turmoil at all times during these thirty-six years. Not long after its birth, it encountered the reaction of Hongxian's imperial system and Zhang Xun's restoration, but the reactionary forces ultimately could not defeat the giant wheel of the advance of the times. Attempts to restore the republic to an empire all failed. However, after twists and turns, it created a situation of autocratic rule and civil war by the Northern Warlords. They were selfish, self-interested, and short-sighted, knowing only themselves and not the country. Cao Kun's bribery to become president reached the pinnacle of darkness in our domestic politics. Therefore, the Kuomintang formed a revolutionary government and vowed to launch the Northern Expedition to overthrow the warlords who were dividing up the country and to unify the country. When the National Government established its capital in Nanjing, it was full of vigor, and the whole country looked brand new. The people all looked forward to the realization of the Three Principles of the People. But unfortunately, internal troubles and external enemies arose one after another. The "January 28th" Songhu Incident, the "July 7th" Lugouqiao Incident, and the "August 13th" Songhu War followed one after another, eventually leading to an all-out war of resistance. In eight years, our Chinese nation experienced countless dangers and tasted countless hardships. The result of bleeding, sweating, and arduous resistance was nominally victory, but in reality, it was completely destroyed by the rebellion of the communist bandits. This group of bandits uses communism as a slogan, robbing property as an action, liquidation and struggle as an excuse, and violent dictatorship as a goal. Under the harassment of bandits, the people have already tasted the pain of burning, killing, looting, and robbery. Those outside the bandit areas also suffer from policy errors and shrinking production. Not only can Zhu live and work in peace, but also be threatened by hunger and death. Living in deep water and scorching fire is a true reflection of the lives of ordinary people today.</p>
<p>However, despite all the pain we have expressed above, swallowing our tears, we are still unwilling to become passive and stand idly by. We still have a strong belief in the bright future of the country. Although the Republic of China has been in trouble for thirty-six years, the difficulties and trials it has encountered have all been overcome by the great and unyielding spirit passed down by our national ancestors. As the saying goes, "adversity builds a nation." After being tempered by thousands of hammers and tongs, the Republic of China has long become an unconquerable nation. Although there are thorns and difficulties in front of us, we will never be afraid and will never retreat. We will still stand tall, stride forward. The Republic of China is over thirty years old, in the prime of its life, and will surely overcome any difficulties and create a brilliant future. Today is her thirty-seventh birthday. All the past is like yesterday's death, and all the future is like today's birth. Although the world situation is in deepening crisis, and the domestic situation is increasingly exposed, not only will it not make us frustrated and give up on ourselves, but it will only make us even more invigorated and make us work harder. We must be diligent and frugal, suppress rebellion and build the country, relieve the people from their suffering, and lay the foundation of the country on bedrock. Then we must grit our teeth and catch up head-on to cope with the future upheavals in the world. We believe that the Republic of China will be able to pass this serious test and find a way out of the crisis. But all of this responsibility lies on the shoulders of the national people who are celebrating National Day today!</p>

<p>[Our Correspondent in Nanjing, 9th] Wang Qinglan, the murderer who shot and killed Henan refugee students on Jiankang Road in Beijing, is still detained at the Beijing District Procuratorate.

However, Nanjing newspapers reported that Wang is from Shandong. In order to protect the interests of Americans in China, the Embassy is specifically inquiring whether Wang Qinglan is American or Chinese."

<p>To be Completed Within One Year Starting Next Month</p>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Nanchang, 9th] Liu Jida, Director of the Land Administration Bureau, talked about his return from a tour of the seventh district on the 9th: Jiangxi Province's land administration is almost completely stalled due to tight county-level staffing and the fact that many landlords use aliases to divide their households or evade reporting. This basic work of local governance is almost completely stalled. Now, the provincial government has decided to select Gan County and Yifeng to trial implement support for owner-cultivators. It is planned to collect 300,000 mu of land in Gan County and 200,000 mu in Yifeng to support 25,000 owner-cultivator households. This new policy will be implemented in phases. If the Executive Yuan can approve the funding and the period, it will begin next month and be completed within one year.</p>

<p>[Our Correspondent in Nanchang, 9th] For Shanghai refugees to migrate to Jiangxi for cultivation, the local authorities have decided to allocate the Yushan-Shangrao area in the eastern section of the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway.

The Jiangxi Agricultural and Forestry Department's 29 agricultural farms own 100,000 mu of barren land, and only half of the land has been reclaimed. The department now plans to accommodate 3,500 refugees from Shanghai at each agricultural farm, but also feels that funding is insufficient.</p>

<p>[Our Correspondent in Xinxiang, 9th] Commerce in Zhengzhou, Kaifeng, and Xinxiang, three important economic towns, has now plunged into an extreme state of chaos. Many shops have closed due to the scarcity of goods, especially the lack of food and coal, which is a common phenomenon in the three towns. Due to the authorities' lack of effective control, coupled with the hoarding and manipulation by profiteers, almost everything needed by the people is obtained from the black market. Grain prices have even exceeded the limited price by a factor of one. The August 19th limited price is nothing more than a thing of the past. According to business people, the strict control of goods leaving Shanghai, Xuzhou, and other places has resulted in many goods ordered by merchants being detained and unable to be shipped, so the supply cannot meet the demand, which is also one of the reasons for the black market. The reporter now reports in good faith, and the government needs to pay attention and quickly make effective improvements.</p>

Yesterday, Principal Shi of Wu Ling School visited Zhou Dalei, Chairman of the Chamber of Commerce, on his way back to Feng Hua from Shanghai, conveying Chiang's instructions: (1) The supply of goods in Ningbo should be based on the Chamber of Commerce's statistics of monthly needs, with collective purchasing and distribution to various industries and markets. (2) The Xin Jiang Bridge is a vital transportation route in eastern Zhejiang, and it is hoped that local people will be motivated to raise funds quickly for its construction. After receiving the above instructions, Zhou convened representatives from various industries today to thoroughly discuss procurement methods. While acknowledging the necessity of building the Xin Jiang Bridge, the large amount of funding required necessitates further consultation with all parties to jointly plan its implementation.</p>

<p>[Our Nanchang Dispatch on the 9th] The "August 19th" economic defense line in Nanchang City has been breached by price surges and the black market. Price-controlled goods such as rice, oil, and cigarettes are available only to those with money, and the grain situation is even more serious.

<p>[New York Air Mail] The Chinese Modern Painting Exhibition opened on the 10th at the Du Cheng Museum in New York. Dr. Gu Weijun, our ambassador to the United States, wrote a special preface to introduce it, the original text of which is as follows: "Chinese art has always occupied a unique position in the world art scene. Through the efforts of scholars and artists over several centuries, it has created a special style containing spiritual and philosophical significance. Therefore, masterpieces of all ages have been treasured by people of all countries, and their contribution to cultural exchange between Chinese and foreign people is by no means insignificant.</p>
<p>However, the works of modern Chinese artists are less known in various countries, which actually affects the world's understanding of modern China. In recent decades, Chinese art has made considerable progress and can fully reflect the thoughts and lives of the Chinese people today, as well as the symphony produced by contact with Western culture.</p>
<p>I am very willing to introduce to the American people the modern Chinese painting exhibition being actively prepared by Professors Wang Yachen and Wang Shaoling. This painting exhibition is organized by the parties concerned in cooperation with Mr. Pu Ailun of the Metropolitan Museum, who himself has extensive and profound research on Chinese culture.</p>
<p>Professor Wang is a famous Chinese artist and educator, who has served as the president of Xinhua Normal School for many years and was recently sent to the United States by the Ministry of Education to study art education. Mr. Wang has studied Western painting in the United States for many years and was recently hired by the Central University as a Western painting teacher.</p>
<p>Entrusted by the China Cultural Relics Research Association and the International Cultural Cooperation Association, Wang and Wang brought more than 120 masterpieces by famous artists for exhibition. I firmly believe that Americans who appreciate Chinese art will want to be the first to see them.</p>
<p>This exhibition will first be held at the Metropolitan Museum, and then will be exhibited in several other cities, so that people in all parts of the United States can have the most opportunities to directly recognize these works. I firmly believe that the noble purpose and hard work of the two gentlemen will inspire people here to develop an interested appreciation for the best modern Chinese paintings."</p>

<h3 id="e63">Truman Plans to Send Special Envoy to Moscow to Meet Stalin and Eliminate Crisis; Marshall Returns to the U.S. to Confer and Strongly Opposes; Neutral UN Representatives Mediate, But No Results Yet <a href="#e63" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c63" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">63</a></h3>
<p>[Reported by Our Publication] Washington, 9th (Broadcast from District): Marshall returned here this morning. President Truman had already waited at the airport and then went to the White House to hold an emergency meeting to decide whether to send a special envoy to Moscow to meet with Stalin to eliminate the differences between the U.S. and the Soviet Union, just like Hopkins' mission in 1945. It is reported that Marshall opposes this plan and advocates for its implementation to be delayed.</p>
<p>[Reported by Our Publication] Washington, 9th (Broadcast): Well-informed sources reported on the 9th that President Truman has appointed former Supreme Court Justice Vinson as a special envoy to Moscow to eliminate the crisis between the U.S. and the Soviet Union. The White House and the State Department have not commented on this. Secretary of State Marshall is returning to the U.S. from Paris. It is feared that Marshall's hasty return was caused by Vinson's mission to the Soviet Union. It is claimed that Marshall believes this will hinder his mission at the UN and his personal negotiations with the Soviet Union regarding the Berlin and other issues. However, according to another report, Truman consulted Marshall on this matter, and after Marshall firmly opposed it, he dismissed the idea. Therefore, Marshall's return to the U.S. is purely for the purpose of reporting directly to Truman on the international situation. Another report states that the Vinson mission was initiated and carried out by the White House and was not agreed upon by the State Department. Marshall only learned about this in Paris. It is claimed that Marshall spoke to Truman by transatlantic telephone and strongly opposed it. He will insist on opposing it to the end upon his return to the U.S.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Paris, 9th] It is rumored that Truman plans to send Under Secretary of State Vinson to the Soviet Union to meet with Stalin to discuss the Berlin crisis, but Marshall strongly opposes it. The British and French delegations here are greatly puzzled by this. UN personnel believe that the attitude of the U.S. delegation has been incomprehensible in recent days. "When they first came to Paris, they were aggressive and insisted that the Berlin issue be submitted to the Security Council instead of the General Assembly. However, in recent days, their attitude has been mysterious and they have refused to disclose their purpose."</p>
<p>[French News Agency, Paris, 9th] The representatives of six neutral countries—China, Argentina, Colombia, Belgium, and Canada—held a private consultation this morning, chaired by Argentine Foreign Minister Bramuglia, to mediate the Berlin issue. After a seventy-minute discussion, no concrete solution was reached, and it was decided to adjourn the meeting. No date has been set for the next meeting. According to diplomatic observers, the meeting broke up without results, probably because Vyshinsky was waiting for instructions from Moscow.</p>

<p>[Associated Press, Paris, 9th] The Western countries' atomic energy control plan was approved by a large majority in the UN subsidiary committee on the 9th, despite strong opposition from the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Paris, 9th] British representative Shawcross stated in the UN Political Committee on the 9th that the Soviet Union's current military strength is two and a half times that of before the war, and denounced the Soviet Union's disarmament proposal as "useless propaganda." Shawcross insisted that if the Soviet Union wants to reach an agreement on either disarmament or atomic control, it should be open and honest and put all its cards on the table. He also stated that unless an agreement on atomic control and measurement is reached first, there can be no agreement on the reduction of conventional armaments. Previously, Polish representative Mochnevsky launched an attack, claiming that the world's fear of war was caused by the Truman Doctrine and the Marshall Plan. He supported the proposal to reduce the military strength of the five powers by one-third within one year. Belarusian representative Kiselev repeated his old tune, accusing American personnel of planning to wage war against the Soviet Union and condemning the Western European alliance as "full of aggression."</p>
<p>[Our Publication] Paris, 9th (Broadcast): It is expected that the U.S. will follow Britain in rejecting the Soviet Union's proposal to reduce the military strength of the five powers by one-third within one year. The U.S. will accuse the Soviet proposal of being insincere and merely a "propaganda tactic."</p>

<p>May Cause Serious Political Consequences</p>
<p>[French News Agency, Berlin, 8th] The Berlin City Council met in the British zone tonight and decided to hold Berlin city elections on December 5th.</p>
<p>[French News Agency, Berlin, 8th] Observers here believe that the Berlin City Council's unanimous passage of the resolution to hold elections on December 5th in the absence of Communist Party members may cause serious political consequences. A British military government spokesman said that although the Allied authorities in the Western zone had recently approved the election procedures proposed by the City Council, the approval was not an order or a suggestion. The Soviet authorities have not yet clearly stated their position on this. A previous Soviet communique stated that this was "untrue and provocative," and the Soviet authorities would try to prevent the election. Another foreign observer said, "I hope that we will not risk a third world war in order to have Professor Luther serve as mayor of Berlin."</p>

<p>[Associated Press, Ulsterton, 9th] British wartime Prime Minister Churchill said to the Conservative Party conference, "It seems that we are relentlessly moving toward the Third World War. Communist Soviet Union has fully armed, and its military strength in Europe has already exceeded the total of the Western countries." Churchill then sadly declared, "I do not want to speak empty words, but to tell you that there is still hope for reconciliation with the Soviet Union." After severely condemning "the increasingly blatant aggression and the utter betrayal of trust and justice by the Soviet government," Churchill said that he has always been confused as to why the British and American people, who have had so much experience in the past, still cannot promptly realize the danger of the Soviet Union's challenge to their lives and freedom from the East. Churchill said, "The fourteen people in the Kremlin (referring to the Soviet Politburo) arbitrarily and totalitarianly rule 300 million people, and the extent of their authority is unprecedented since Ivan the Great. They now dominate half of Europe in a communist way." Churchill said that the Berlin situation "could lead to a global war at any time." If he were in office, he would retaliate against the Soviet Union's import of war materials as a bargaining chip. He said, "The government's policy is to disregard all consequences and not retreat a single step in Berlin. We give it our full support."</p>

When Wu Kuo-chen and Wu Kai-hsien called on the President yesterday morning, they gave a detailed report on the city's control and regulation situation. Director Wu also emphasized that price controls should be coordinated with production and should not be divorced from each other; otherwise, price controls would fail. Without production, there would be no goods or prices, creating a problem of availability rather than price. After listening to the opinions separately, the President gave strict instructions on the spot. In addition, Commander Xuan also paid a visit to the President in the morning, reporting on the security situation in Shanghai.</p>
<p>From 3:00 PM, the President summoned Yu Hung-chun and Yu Shu-ping. The President was very concerned about the financial and price situation in Shanghai, especially the rampant speculation.

The discussions were very detailed, and considerable decisions were made. Tomorrow (referring to today), the executing agencies can proceed according to the decisions." Vice Minister Chen also stated that Shanghai's grain supply is mainly for civilian consumption, with military grain secondary, but the Ministry of Food is still trying to balance both.

<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 9th] According to the Grain News Agency, Shanghai flour mills are experiencing a daily decrease in raw material inventory. Furthermore, due to the price control of 10.30 yuan, while wheat transported from Suzhou, Wuxi, and other places to Shanghai costs 11 yuan, the source has almost disappeared. Even if purchased, adulteration reaches more than 10%, greatly affecting the product. As a result, the output of various manufacturers has decreased by an average of one-half compared to the time of the August 19th price control. The Ministry of Food originally planned to purchase 1.4 million bags of flour from Shanghai factories each month, but it has had to significantly reduce this amount. Of the 700,000 bags planned for the first half of October, only 400,000 bags are guaranteed. Manufacturers have truthfully reported the impending crisis to the Ministry of Food, requesting negotiations with relevant parties to adjust the price control of wheat in Shanghai, referencing market prices in Suzhou and Wuxi, to maintain the current production situation. The Ministry of Food attaches great importance to this matter and is currently discussing a proper solution with all parties. According to the Economic Management Committee, Shanghai flour mills' request to adjust price controls has been telegraphed to the supervisor of the Shanghai region for review and handling, and a reply has been requested directly from the Ministry of Food.</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper] The city's general materials inspection continued yesterday and was completed as scheduled by the evening. The types of materials, locations, and names of owners in each district where the inspected quantities did not match the registered quantities or were moved without authorization are being sorted out by each police precinct and are expected to be submitted to the General Headquarters for review and handling next Monday. Mr. Yu Shuping met with reporters at 6:00 PM yesterday and said: "This general materials inspection was successfully completed with the assistance of all parties, which is very gratifying. During the inspection process, it was found that many manufacturers' materials were stored in several districts. In other words, the warehouses in a certain area often stored materials from manufacturers in other areas, and some merchants moved the materials without authorization after registration, which made verification very difficult during the inspection." He has recommended to the Economic Supervisor's Office to order the warehouse industry association to notify all warehouses to quickly list in detail the types, quantities, periods, and owners of the materials stored as of the 8th of this month and submit them to the Bureau of Social Affairs for comparison with the results of the general inspection.

<h3 id="e100">A Large-Scale Health Exhibition Will Be Held Today at Aurora University, with an Electric Lung Disease Model that Is Most Thought-Provoking <a href="#e100" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c100" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">100</a></h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] The Municipal Health Bureau, in view of the excessively high morbidity and mortality rates of Shanghai citizens, and in order to make the general public aware of the importance of hygiene and medicine in a popular way, has specially organized a large-scale health exhibition, which will be open to the public free of charge at the auditorium of Aurora University starting from Double Ten Festival. This kind of exhibition is still a pioneering event in the city after the victory. The preparatory work is jointly undertaken by the Bureaus of Education, Public Utilities, and Public Works, as well as more than ten organizations including Tongji, Aurora, St. John's, Tongde, Shanghai, and Southeast Medical Colleges, Shanghai Dental College, Pasteur Institute, Anti-Tuberculosis Association, and the United States Information Service. The exhibits include fifteen groups such as decomposition and anatomy, physiology, pathology, bacteria, parasites, infectious disease management, nursing, maternal and child health, school hygiene, and factory hygiene. The order of display is: the first part explains the structure of the human body, the second part explains the sources of disease, and the third part explains how to improve health. Each exhibition room has eye-catching slogans and statistical charts attached to the walls. Among them, the lung disease exhibition room is equipped with a thunderous model, with a sickbed on the left and a coffin on the right. The explanation in the middle states that only 3.1 million people died in the war of resistance against Japan in the past eight years, but as many as 10.8 million people died of lung disease. On average, 3 million out of every 100,000 people die of lung disease each year. In terms of wealth loss, if each lung disease patient spends one gold yuan per day, society must spend 5 billion gold yuan each year in addition to not being able to increase production. This model is novel and most thought-provoking.</p>

<h3 id="e102">Daily Necessities Difficult to Purchase as Required, The General Labor Union Registers and Asks the Authorities to Implement Rationing <a href="#e102" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c102" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">102</a></h3>
<p>Since the government promulgated the Emergency Financial and Economic Measures on August 19 this year, issued gold yuan, and implemented currency reform, national prices have been limited to the August 19 prices, and the index-based salary calculation method has been abolished, so workers' wages have also been frozen. The gold yuan conversion standard is calculated based on the cost of living index announced on August 15. The Municipal General Labor Union believes that the index is based on the average prices from August 1 to August 13, which is far from the price limits on August 19, and some workers have not yet been able to convert into gold yuan according to the index, so it is believed that the losses suffered by workers are quite large. In particular, in recent days, it has been difficult for workers to purchase daily necessities at the limited prices, so the union has repeatedly reported the hardships of workers to the government authorities and requested appropriate adjustments, but due to the current economic management situation, the request has not been approved, so the lives of general workers have been greatly threatened. After the union submitted it to the 53rd council meeting for discussion, it was decided to register all union members and their families in the city, so as to request the government to implement rationing at limited prices to maintain the inadequacy of life. After careful consideration by the responsible persons of the union, the resolution was notified to all industry unions in the city yesterday to comply with and organize an investigation committee.</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper] Dai Hongxin, owner of the Dai Hongji uniform shop at No. 757, Jiujiang Road, has a daughter named Bingxia, who is twenty-one years old and beautiful. Dai loves her like a pearl. Zhou Keding, 25, a former soldier of the 23rd Regiment of the Military Police stationed in the 3rd Brigade of the Garrison Headquarters, was dismissed due to misconduct. He came to the shop to have a uniform made and gradually became intimate with the daughter. Zhou, with evil intentions, was determined to force himself on Bingxia, and Hongxin asked about his military status. In early December of last year, Dai returned to his hometown with his family, leaving his daughter in charge of the store. Zhou learned of this situation and sneaked into the daughter's room one night and forced himself on her. The daughter was unable to resist and was abused. At about 11:00 PM on the 7th of this month, Zhou came to the store again and insisted on inviting the daughter out to talk. The daughter refused, and Zhou became angry and wrote a threatening letter, ordering Dai to hand it over to his daughter. The next morning, the daughter received a call from Zhou, asking her to meet at the Nanguo Restaurant, otherwise he would deal with her severely. The daughter was in a dilemma and finally went to the meeting. She then went to Zhou's residence at No. 27, Guizhou Road, and Zhou took out a sharp blade, forcing the daughter to leave her family and marry him. The daughter pretended to go home, and Zhou followed her to the store. When he saw the daughter's father, he slapped him twice and threatened him. Someone called the police, who arrived and took Zhou to the bureau for interrogation and confirmed the facts. Zhou was accused of obstructing family and transferred to the District Attorney's Office for investigation.</p>

<p>[Report from our newspaper] Liu Yuqing, a businessman newly arrived in Shanghai from Peiping and Tianjin, residing at Cishu Mansion, was previously accused of using the Tianjin Yixing Factory Office as a cover to continuously engage in private banking operations since May of this year. After police investigation, codebooks and telegrams were seized on the spot, and it was determined that the amount of funds transferred from Tianjin reached a substantial sum of 6,000 Gold Yuan. The case was transferred to the District Procuratorate for investigation and closure, and Liu was prosecuted for violating banking laws. The District Court held a hearing yesterday afternoon, where Liu, accompanied by his lawyer, presented four points in his defense: (1) The 6,000 Gold Yuan remittance was borrowed from the Dalu Bank of Tai City for the purpose of purchasing cotton yarn in Shanghai, as evidenced by the loan agreement from Dalu Bank; it was not a foreign exchange speculation. (2) The seized drafts of letters concerned the severe economic controls in Shanghai after "August 19th" [referring to the currency reform of August 19, 1948], and contained nothing else. (3) The secret code was used by the former residents of the office, Xinyi and Fuqian, for foreign exchange speculation, and the defendant himself did not understand it. (4) The destroyed documents were mere notes and not important documents. After the defense, the court briefly questioned the points provided and scheduled the verdict for the afternoon of the sixteenth.</p>

<p>[Report from our newspaper] The Jinchao case, which has attracted nationwide attention, was previously heard by Judge Wang Jiazhuo of the District Court. Yang Anren was sentenced to seven years of imprisonment, and Mo Sheng was sentenced to four years of imprisonment. The defendants applied for a retrial, but the High Court determined that the original judgment was appropriate in both the application of the law and the sentencing, and approved the original judgment, transferring them to the Shanghai Prison. Subsequently, Yang and others, citing new evidence, applied for a retrial, which was repeatedly rejected by the District Court in accordance with the law. Recently, the High Court, based on an appeal, remanded the case for a new ruling. For the sake of prudence, the District Court telegraphed the Supreme Court to transfer the case to the Capital District Court or another court for handling. The Supreme Court reviewed the case file and determined that the case did not need to be transferred, replying that it could still be handled impartially by the Shanghai District Court. Having learned this, the District Court believed that Yang and others' application for a retrial was still without legal basis and rejected it in a ruling yesterday. The ruling was immediately served to all parties involved.</p>

<p>[Report from our newspaper] According to authoritative sources in the financial community, in order to facilitate state-owned enterprises in obtaining working capital needed for production without increasing currency issuance, the government will allow the issuance of corporate bonds to guide social idle funds through banking organizations for use in production. The plan is to start with a pilot program involving factories and mines affiliated with the Resources Commission, with national banks and bureaus underwriting the bonds and then reselling them to the public. Detailed measures are being discussed and drafted by the Central Bank and various national banks and bureaus. According to relevant sources, the issuance of corporate bonds is not only easier to raise funds, but also simpler in terms of repayment procedures. The public can purchase these bonds, which are stable and reliable with regular repayment and a certain amount of interest. In recent years, the issuance of corporate bonds has been highly developed in Europe and the United States and is an effective way to use private funds. Once the pilot program for state-owned enterprises proves successful, private enterprises may also follow suit.</p>
<h3 id="e117">Cotton Yarn Needed in the Market Supplied Through Allocation by National Banks: China Textile Construction Corporation Held Third Board Meeting Yesterday <a href="#e117" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c117" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">117</a></h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] The China Textile Construction Corporation (紡建) held its third board meeting at 3:30 PM yesterday, chaired by Chen Qitian. The following resolutions were made as a result of the discussions:</p>
<p>(1) After 紡建 is reorganized into a joint-stock company, all personnel, administrative, and business management methods will be handled in accordance with general company practices, and past systems will be adjusted accordingly.</p>
<p>(2) 紡建's current yarn inventory is only sufficient to repay the 行總 (Executive Yuan War Relief Supplies Bureau), the Textile Export Association, and US Aid cotton yarn, with no remaining amount available for the market. Future market supply issues will be managed by the Central Bank through yarn allocation.</p>
<p>(3) The current General Manager Shu Yunzhang is firm in his intention to resign. However, he will remain in his position in the short term until the board of directors can find a suitable replacement.</p>
<p>(4) Li Bingyu was appointed to represent 紡建 at the World Textile Industry Conference to be held in Geneva.</p>
<h3 id="e118">Cotton Yarn and Cloth Production Declines Daily <a href="#e118" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c118" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">118</a></h3>
<p>The problem of raw materials has not been resolved, and as a result of panic buying, cotton yarn and cloth production has declined, and factories are reducing production. Pan Shihao, chairman of the 复织 Association (Re-weaving Association), suggested that a portion of the 60,000 bales of 行總 (Executive Yuan War Relief Supplies Bureau) cotton yarn stored in the Central Bank be allocated to the market to meet the urgent needs. However, due to the inability to resolve foreign exchange issues, the dyestuffs required by the re-weaving industry have become limited in stock recently and difficult to replenish. Although they can be purchased on the black market, the prices are twice as high as the controlled prices, which will increase costs. Purchasing from the black market would violate the law. Therefore, the industry hopes that the authorities will quickly resolve the raw material problem. Furthermore, the factories of the Qingdao China Textile Branch Company have recently felt a severe shortage of raw materials and are requesting the headquarters to quickly find a way to allocate a large amount of cotton to meet their urgent needs. The company is currently writing to the Cotton Group to quickly allocate the second batch of aid cotton.</p>
<p>Furthermore, according to reports, the yarn market continues to be closed. Small-scale handicrafts manufacturers in the city, for whom cotton yarn is the main raw material, and wholesalers from Suzhou and Hangzhou, have come to Shanghai to compete for purchases from yarn shops, causing Jinling Road yarn wholesale shops to be very crowded. Buyers are mainly interested in the four types of yarn with counts of 16, 20, 32, and 40.</p>
<h3 id="e119">Dull Silk Market <a href="#e119" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c119" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">119</a></h3>
<p>The rayon market remains sluggish. The allocation by the association did not reach its quota yesterday. Japanese goods are no longer available in the market. The raw materials of the Italian goods miscellaneous silk fabrics are considered too substandard, and applications for allocation have decreased. Raw silk transactions are quiet. Sellers are unwilling to sell, and buyers are not interested due to the lack of foreign transportation. The silk weaving industry on this street is mostly applying to the 輸管會 (Export Control Board) for allocation, and only sporadic transactions are taking place in the market.</p>
<p>Retail sales of silk fabrics have begun to slacken. Sichuan silk is becoming scarce due to restrictions on out-of-province sales. Silk factories are about to begin allocating goods, which has somewhat stabilized people's minds.</p>
<p>Furthermore, according to reports, the Central Trust Bureau, acting as an agent for the Government Property Disposal Committee, distributed over 400 boxes of rayon this week and sold woolens, sundries, etc. at auction, obtaining a total of 1.4 million Gold Yuan. It is scheduled to auction off sundries and other goods next Friday.</p>
<h3 id="e120">China Textile Corporation Sells Cloth <a href="#e120" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c120" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">120</a></h3>
<p>Since the cotton cloth market has been suspended, the business of wholesale firms has suddenly declined due to transportation restrictions. Retail cloth shops, stimulated by the panic buying, have sold out their inventories, and their replenishment relies on the supply of cloth from the building weaving industry and the China Textile Construction Corporation. The supply source is still considered sufficient. It is reported that the染织业 (dyeing and weaving industry) has entrusted the Cotton Cloth Association to distribute the first batch of 35,000 pieces, of which a total of 12,000 pieces have been distributed.</p>
<p>The second batch of 64,000 pieces, due to the wide variety of patterns, coincided with the surge in panic buying, and cloth shops were eager to replenish their inventories, so the allocation quota is almost exhausted, with only a few hundred pieces remaining. It is reported that a third batch of 60,000 pieces will be allocated next Monday, with the association preparing to distribute 20,000 pieces first. The China Textile Corporation continues to distribute cloth every Tuesday, Thursday, and Saturday as usual, but due to the surge in demand, the number of customers allocated has been slightly limited. Yesterday, 9-pound 3B Longtou fine cloth was distributed at a price of 18.6 yuan. This fine cloth was originally manufactured for export, with a width of 36 inches and a length of only 30 yards.</p>

<p>According to a spokesperson for the Central Bank, President Yu has revised the regulations regarding the request from the money industry to be exempt from paying security deposits for clearing: (1) Pay half of the prescribed amounts of 10,000, 5,000, and 3,000. (2) Half of the reduced security deposit must be paid before the 10th of this month, and the remaining half must be paid after the completion of the capital increase. Banks must pay the security deposit as prescribed. Half must be paid before October 10th, and the other half must be paid after the capital increase is completed. The Central Bank has notified the banking and money industries in various regions to comply with the above measures.</p>
<p>Furthermore, it has been learned that the request from the banking and money industries to reduce the amount of capital increase is impossible.</p>

<p>[Report from our newspaper] Regarding how to calculate the percentage of credit loans, real estate mortgage loans, or investments to the total amount of deposits as stipulated in the Banking Law, the Ministry of Finance previously stipulated that the total amount of deposits should be calculated on a consolidated basis for the entire bank. It is now learned that, for the sake of calculation convenience, the Ministry of Finance has further clarified in detail as follows: The percentage of such loans and investments to the total amount of deposits "can be calculated by adding and subtracting interbank transactions (adding credit balance and subtracting debit balance) to the deposits of each head office and branch office, resulting in the individual deposits of each head office and branch office, and then calculating the percentage with its individual credit loans, real estate mortgage loans, or investments, in order to simplify the process. If funds other than deposits are used for various loans or investments, they should be included in the calculation of deposits."</p>

<p>Rice continues to arrive, but there are very few transactions in the market. The North Market has 502 shi of Bai Geng and Yang Xian rice, and the South Market has 313 shi, for a total of 815 shi. There are also rice shops selling 110 shi of rice on their own. Although the above rice is sold at controlled prices, it can only be purchased by those who are close to the owners, so transactions have not yet returned to normal.</p>
<p>Grain transactions have almost entered a state of stagnation. Only dozens of bags of raw peanuts were officially offered in the city. Soybeans are difficult to buy, and there are no transactions for corn, red beans, or broad beans. No one is selling high-quality sesame seeds, and no one is buying low-quality sesame seeds, so no transactions have taken place. Kaifeng raw peanuts are 32.7 yuan, and new 生　 are 35.7 yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e127">Active Tea Market <a href="#e127" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c127" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">127</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the foreign firm tea market was relatively active. Because exporters feel that the demand for tea in Europe and Africa is strong, buying interest remains high. However, holders of goods feel that the production season has passed and the market inventory is very scarce, so they remain hesitant, resulting in few attractive transactions. The potential profit is unparalleled.</p>
<p>It is reported that a certain company in the city has received a telegram from Morocco requesting an immediate shipment of 50 tons of 屯 Green tea to meet urgent needs. However, under the above circumstances, the person in charge of the company is currently unable to respond. As for domestic sales tea, there is also a shortage of supply and an excess of demand, and the market atmosphere is firm in the quiet.</p>

<p>The sugar market was popular again yesterday. The prices of various grades are close to the limit. Because the sugar industry will implement an allocation system and stop market transactions, it is generally expected that the supply will be limited, so those in need are taking the opportunity to buy in advance. The amount of goods in the market suddenly decreased, and people's minds became firmer, with most holders watching the situation. No. 22 sand white, No. 45 car white精 sugar are not available in the market, and no prices have been quoted. Medium sand, Xinghua white, Gao Ben factory cotton white are mostly in demand, while the rest are consistent.</p>

<p>The shortage of bricks and ashes is becoming more serious, and builders, unable to stop construction on half-completed houses, are collecting them regardless of the high prices, making the atmosphere of overpricing even more intense. Since the factory stopped supplying cement, retailers have been unable to supply large quantities, and it is difficult to purchase even ten or twenty bags. It is temporarily limited to one or two bags. It is rumored that the price of lime has exceeded the limit by 100%. Someone is calling to buy it. Small and large brick sizes are available for retail, but they are also about to be sold out.</p>

<p>[Report from our Nanjing, 9th] The 37th Joint Annual Meeting of ten scientific organizations, including the China Society for Natural Sciences, the Science Society of China, the New China Mathematical Society, the Chinese Astronomical Society, the Chinese Physical Society, the Chinese Geophysical Society, the Chinese Geographical Society, the Chinese Meteorological Society, the Chinese Zoological Society, and the Chinese Genetics Society, opened in Beijing on the morning of the 9th.</p>
<p>Opening Ceremony</p>
<p>The opening ceremony was held at the Central University Auditorium at 9:00 AM, chaired by Zhou Hongjing. Guests present included Weng Wenhao, Zhou Yichun, Chen Qitian (represented by Wu Chengluo), Shi Fade (representative of the联教组织驻华代表), and many members. The chairman announced the opening of the meeting and briefly reported on the significance of the meeting. Then, Dean Weng, in his capacity as honorary president, delivered a speech, stating that science progresses through research, regardless of current human thought. However, communism seeks to control human thought and unify the world with political power. Therefore, the共匪 do not hesitate to create social instability through armed rebellion, let alone consider the impact on scientific research. Under such circumstances, political awakening can enable the promotion of science. Today's scientists should realize reality, review the old and learn the new, and strive to engage in constructive research. Subsequently, Chairman Zhu Jiahua delivered a speech, pointing out that the biggest difficulty in current scientific research is the issue of funding. Although the efforts of the academic community have not stopped in the past ten years, the Academia Sinica has established a perfect research system in 20 years. He encouraged all groups to cooperate and overcome material difficulties to improve academic standards. Vice President Shen Yi said that in the politically charged capital, the holding of the Joint Annual Meeting is a voice from the desert. The holding of a grand exhibition is thanked on behalf of all citizens and wishes to share "Do not speak, we continue to work in disappointment" with scientists and engineers. Then, Minister Chen of the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, representing Wu Chengluo, President Gu Yuxiu of National Chengchi University, Director Selo of the British Council Science Group, and others delivered speeches one after another, comforting the hard work of research and expecting greater success. Finally, Shen Qiyi, Secretary-General of the Organizing Committee, reported on the preparation process, and then Ren Hongjun gave the annual meeting speech.

In the end, CNAC got another nine-meter penalty kick opportunity, and Yu Zhenyue scored, making it 2-2. Since the score was tied at the end of regulation time, there was a twenty-minute overtime. CNAC's Yu Musen and Jin Jiabiao each scored a goal, giving them the final victory with a score of 4-2. Although Huidar lost, their strength was no less than that of CNAC. The referee was Xu Guoliang.</p>
<p>In the second match between Samsung and Longtou, both sides played very cleanly and admirably. After more than ten minutes of stalemate, Samsung advanced on the left side, Xiao Ziwen crossed the ball, and Lin Dianyi shot it in, opening the scoring and securing the victory with this solitary goal. In the second half, Longtou counterattacked, and their offensive became even more intense in the last five minutes. Samsung's Lu Zhengxiang committed a handball in the penalty area, and Yao Qingsheng took a penalty kick. Longtou's failure to score sealed their fate. The result was still 1-0. The referee was Ma Youyu.</p>
<p>Samsung and CNAC are scheduled to hold the final match for the overall championship at 3:00 pm today. The referee is Fang Rongfu, and the linesmen are Zang Wenbin and Xu Guoliang.</p>

<p>[United Press, Cleveland, 8th] The third game of the World Series moved from Boston to Cleveland today. The Cleveland Indians, riding the momentum of their initial victory over the Boston Braves yesterday, won again 2-0. With a total of three games played, the Indians have won two and lost one. If they win two more games, they can win the 1948 World Series championship. Today's game was almost entirely dominated by Indians pitcher Bearden, whose performance was amazing. Bearden only gave up five hits, and only one Brave made it to third base. On the other hand, Bearden not only threw many deadly knuckleballs, but also calmly handled tense situations, and personally hit a double and a single, laying the foundation for a great victory. After the game, the Braves were in low spirits, but they all acknowledged Bearden's superiority. They believe that although they are behind, hope is not lost. The Indians believe that with so many pitchers on their team, they can win the championship in the next two games.</p>

<p>— Jingwen</p>
<p>Reading the news from the Paris Conference these past few days in the newspaper is truly interesting. Many people are worried that a third world war may break out as a result, but I, like the slippery view of people like Tingli Ross, believe that although war is very "possible," it is also "not necessarily" so. Seeing British Foreign Secretary Bevin's sharp speech and Vyshinsky's retort certainly makes one sweat for the matter of war; however, seeing the photograph of American representative Austin and Vyshinsky laughing shoulder-to-shoulder, you almost suspect that they are at a cocktail party in the Palais de Chaillot.</p>
<p>International diplomacy is, of course, sacred and extraordinary. A single misstep can often lead to unexpectedly serious consequences, especially in the case of this United Nations General Assembly. The attending representatives are mostly heads of state from various countries, and their sighs and laughs become major headlines in the world's telecommunications. The situation of war and peace may be determined by a raise of their hands or a slam of their tables. It is not only sacred, but also extraordinarily important.</p>
<p>However, although the identity of international conference representatives is very important, they are still human beings of flesh and blood. They have emotions, common sense, and even humor. This column has previously published special features on the representatives of various countries at the conference, such as representatives who like to sketch portraits at the conference, representatives who love to write poetry, and representatives who are good at drawing curves. If you look past their representative identities, they are no different from a group of elementary school students in a classroom.</p>
<p>If we were to say that the fate of our world is decided by this group of people, it seems too incredible. Yet the fact cannot deny this point. Writing this, I can't help but think of Napoleon, as described by Tolstoy in his book "War and Peace." Napoleon's private life was very romantic. He even had to spray perfume before going into battle. That such a figure could lead an army, conquer Germany, Austria, England, and Russia, and become emperor is also a historical miracle. However, after the Battle of Waterloo, where was the hero of a generation? Napoleon was nothing more than an ordinary prisoner of war.</p>
<p>Whether a person is important or not has nothing to do with the person themselves, especially for politicians. The reason why politicians appear important is simply the power granted to them by their position. Once a person has a position and power, even if they still want to try to maintain their original human face, it is often impossible. Friends often say when they meet that so-and-so is now in power. The close relationship of munching spiced beans and peanuts together in the past can no longer be restored. Now, not only must one submit a name card before seeing them, but one can only nod and agree when meeting. So everyone says that so-and-so has become "snobbish" after gaining power. However, I can understand this kind of person very well. The person is still so-and-so at heart, but their position and power have to create a barrier between you, me, and them. Without sufficient courage, this barrier is not easily broken. Once they lose their position and power, they will still be able to return to the comradeship of spiced beans and peanuts.</p>
<p>What makes power and position a burden that individuals cannot get rid of is what is called majesty. The origin of majesty actually arises from people's illusions about the external appearances of things. For example, a dance hall will never give rise to a sense of majesty, but if it is changed into a solemn meeting hall, people who are in it cannot help but feel a sense of gravity, and a sense of majesty will also arise spontaneously. The Palais de Chaillot, where the Paris Conference is now located, was originally a museum. It has solemnity, but perhaps not true majesty. However, once it is converted into an international conference hall, and with all the people coming in and out being people with the highest power and status in the contemporary world, how can it not appear majestic?</p>
<p>Since majesty easily creates a heavy mood, and with everyone involved having their own power and status background, it is truly difficult to seek lighthearted peace negotiations in such an environment. The psychological reserve has long become an obstacle to harmony and cooperation. If verbal conflicts are encountered occasionally, it is rare for them not to become stalemates. We Chinese have always paid attention to the diplomacy of negotiating between cups of wine. The Western cocktail party is similar to this. If major international conferences in the future can be carried out in the sounds of "cheers, cheers," and if power, status, and the majesty that comes with them are seen as less important, then world peace may be hopeful.</p>
<p>Diluting the concept of power, status, and majesty is difficult for those involved, but easy for onlookers, because those involved are on the stage. The concept of "maintaining one's stage presence" is extremely difficult to break. Conversely, if the audience offstage can view the "plot" more plainly, without having to clap and cheer or boo, then the people onstage can easily come down, and they will not have to pretend and do a real show, or use real knives and guns. Our world now seems like a dance hall. The play is being acted, but it is still a fake play. We only ask that all parties in the audience can relax a step, and then the situation of real knives and guns can be avoided.</p>

<p>— Yi Jun</p>
<p>My residence is in Zhabei, but my workplace is in Nanshi. Every morning I take the No. 2B public bus from Zhabei to Nanshi, and every afternoon I return from Nanshi to Zhabei. Speaking of taking the public bus, one needs several great skills, namely: patience, resistance, and agility.</p>
<p>As the name suggests, a public bus is not a private car for one person, so it cannot be available at any time. You must wait at the stop. While waiting, you must have patience. It is fortunate if the bus arrives in one or two minutes, and it is not bad luck if it arrives in five minutes or a quarter of an hour. But it is unlucky when you have to wait for half an hour, forty or fifty minutes. But you have to be patient - yelling, jumping, getting anxious, and cursing are useless.</p>
<p>You are not the only one waiting for the bus, and the more people wait, the more crowded it gets. So the arrival of the bus is a great joy, but getting on the bus is a major emergency. Before the bus stops, people have already surrounded the door in a circle. The people on the bus have not yet gotten off, but the people waiting to get on have already drawn their swords and are ready to charge into battle. Whoever is agile will get on first. At the same time, you have to have resistance. You have to be as stable as Mount Tai and as solid as a rock so that you are not pushed away by others. Your back and waist must be able to resist the pressure of other people's fists, arms, and kneecaps. Your feet must be prepared to be trampled on by others. You must seize any opportunity and enter any opening. See if you are that agile.</p>
<p>Is it all right once you get on the bus? No, you still have to be patient. If there is no seat, you have to stand. If people are pressing on you, hands are covering your head, or your head and neck are encircled, you can only be patient and only resist. Everyone is squeezed into a group, crushed into a pile. The pushing, bumping, and falling when the bus starts are needless to say. Sometimes, when the express bus stops suddenly, the whole bus of people falls sharply in the same direction. This "disaster" is unbearable. The production of carbon dioxide inside the bus is abundant, and the people who are coughing are not to be outdone, putting on a wonderful performance. There are also those who spit, showing great skill. With an open mouth, there is a whoosh, a mouthful of phlegm, like a meteor, like a missile, or like the white light of a swordsman, already crossing over your head and going outside the window. But when the phlegm passes over your head, there must be some scattered saliva, big beads and small beads falling on your head or sticking to your collar. You also have to be patient with this. Because there are many people of this kind, and if you interfere with them, they will not be honest, and will "retaliate with an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth." Since those who cough cough, and those who spit spit, naturally bacteria fly around, each seeking a host. Therefore, your body must have resistance, and then you can avoid contracting diseases.</p>
<p>The person sitting in front of you will not get off the bus, so there is no empty seat. You have to be patient. When there is an empty seat, you have to be agile so that you can grab the seat. If you fail to grab the seat, you still have to be patient.</p>
<p>This situation is not an exaggeration at all. I know that the trolleybus is better because it has a larger capacity. I take the public bus, the No. 2 public bus, and the No. 2 public bus with a "B" on it. There are surprisingly few buses, so this situation is never an exception. There is really never an exception. The situation is better with the No. 2 public bus without the "B", because there are more buses. The most commendable thing is the orderly queuing at the Qiujiang Road station, showing a clear order.</p>
<p>Because I take the No. 2B public bus every day, I have learned three major skills: patience, resistance, and agility.</p>

<p>— Qian Dacheng</p>
<p>Mr. Wang Huaizu (Niansun) of Gaoyou was a master of practical learning during the Qing dynasty. His book "Reading Miscellany" is already immortal. However, his hand-annotated classical books are rarely seen. In July of the thirty-fourth year of the Republic of China, I unexpectedly obtained his hand-annotated "Jiao Shi Yi Lin" at Songshi Studio in Suzhou. The original book was the "Jin Dai Mi Shu" edition from Jiguge. Initially, the bookseller did not mention whose annotations they were. I carefully examined it and found two large square seals, "Wang Family Collection of Gaoyou" and "Distinguished Family of Huaihai," confirming that it was once owned by Mr. Huaizu. The book is annotated in both red and black ink, meticulously referencing the Tang and Song dynasty encyclopedias "Youyang Zazu" and Mr. Lu Yidian of my county's Yilin school's collation of Song dynasty texts. The annotations are extensive, profound, and refined, unlike what one would expect from someone merely known as a book collector. The handwriting is extremely similar to that of Mr. Huaizu's annotated "Song Bao's Explanations of Characters, Supplemented with Lost Sections" in the Nanjing Longpanli National Academy of Learning Library. Comparing it with Wang's ink calligraphy in the "Chart of the Shuowen System," the resemblance is striking. Therefore, I know that it is Wang's hand-annotated edition without a doubt. I obtained it at a low price. Shouldn't I consider myself extremely fortunate? Throughout my life, I have been fortunate to see many old books, but due to my family's poverty, I could not keep them for myself, like clouds passing before my eyes. Only in the past did I obtain a fragment of Lu Baoyun's hand-annotated "Chuo Geng Lu" at a small price, which can be compared to this. I intend to transcribe some of his annotations to show them to those studying practical learning. The owner of Songshi Studio, Elder Zhang, passed away this spring. Recalling the joy of sitting and discussing art with him in the past is like another lifetime. I have also left Wumen (Suzhou) and returned to my hometown, and my interest in seeking books has greatly diminished. Fine books are also not often seen. I write this to record the shadows of past dreams.</p>
<h3 id="e159">Old News from the Double Tenth Festival, Newly Copied <a href="#e159" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c159" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">159</a></h3>
<p>— Song Xian</p>
<p>In the first year of the Republic of China, on the Double Tenth Festival, this newspaper's "Free Talk" section had a commemorative article that said: "What day is today? It is the first National Day of the Republic of China. Colorful flags are flying high, and the whole country is ecstatic. However, upon careful examination of national affairs, there are feelings in our hearts. Regarding domestic affairs, opinions are divided, and there is internal strife; regarding foreign affairs, the powers are watching like tigers, and recognition is uncertain; regarding finances, the Minister of Agriculture looks up at the roof, and resources are exhausted to meet needs; regarding military affairs, disbandment is not organized, and frequent alarms occur; the common people lack patriotism, and there are many rebellious elements in the border regions. The land is scarred, and it is unbearable to look back; the future is thorny, and how can we not be saddened! On this commemorative occasion, there are endless sighs, how can we force ourselves to follow the vulgar and engage in joyful celebrations?" Although times have changed, except for the "recognition" mentioned, it still seems to be applicable as a reflection on this year's Double Tenth Festival.</p>
<p>Also, in the first year of the Republic of China, on the Double Tenth Festival, the Founding Father attended the National Day celebration held by the Chinese Students' Association of the World in Shanghai. During his speech, he said: "...Although the Republic of China has been established, it is still in a dangerous era. Internal unrest has not been quelled, and foreign troubles are frequent. It is like building a tall building, the foundation has been laid, but it still needs to be constructed. I hope that my compatriots will have an adventurous spirit, a persevering spirit, and cooperate to support the government from now on to create a first-class power on earth. This is what I deeply hope for from you all..."</p>
<p>After copying the newspaper, I cannot help but sigh. I only hope that "future generations will view us as we view the past!"</p>
<p>###</p>
<p>Confucius said, "For three months, he did not know the taste of meat." If he were to patrol the streets and alleys of Beijing, especially during the autumn and winter months, he would smell the aroma of meat everywhere. The soil here is thick and lacks water, so the taste of fish and shrimp is far less fresh and delicious than in the south. However, the fatty and tender meat, especially mutton, and the cooking methods researched over hundreds of years are unparalleled in the country. The "Xikou mutton" from outside the Great Wall is considered the best. The three best ways to cook it are "stewing," "hot pot," and "roasting." "Stewing" refers to mutton of the highest quality, adding fragrant family secrets passed down for generations, hence the price is particularly high and business is flourishing. "Roasting" involves placing a large iron grate over a stove fire, cutting the meat into thin slices, mixing it with spices, sauce, and oil, allowing diners to use iron forks to skewer and roast the meat themselves, eating it as soon as it's cooked. It's exceptionally fresh and savory. A certain Wan family in the western part of the city is the most famous, but there is also one in the northern part of the city, and people flock to it in droves, having to queue for a spot as if at a bank run. And when eating, they spread their legs, extend their arms, and adopt postures like martial arts performers, opening their mouths like hungry tigers devouring food. It's both amusing and impressive. Even fashionable men and women gather in groups, roasting and devouring the meat with gusto, somewhat reminiscent of the "powder-faced girls, cutting raw meat to eat the pungent smell" in the Dream of the Red Chamber. "Hot pot" involves using a hot pot with burning charcoal in the center, the fire is fierce and the soup is boiling. Thin slices of mutton are prepared in advance, cooked briefly in the boiling soup, then taken out and dipped into a small bowl of sauce, wine, and various spices, mixed and eaten. It's rich, flavorful, and fatty, loved by many. In all of the above, the meat and hot pots are deliberately displayed outside the door, creating a lively and steaming scene as a form of advertisement. The ancient saying "wine ponds and meat forests" can be experienced in the old capital during the autumn and winter seasons.</p>
<p>Beef and mutton are difficult to popularize in the Beijing market, while pork remains the mainstream meat. The word "meat" is both a general term for all meat and a specific term for pork. If one refers to beef or mutton, one must specify beef or mutton. If one simply mentions "meat," everyone knows it means pork. Chicken and duck are also meat, but they are not referred to as "meat." In restaurants, chicken shreds and duck slices do not need to be specified as chicken meat shreds and duck meat slices, which is the opposite of pork, which is only referred to as "meat," also somewhat amusing. Currently, pork cannot be obtained in the Beijing market except on the black market. Beef, mutton, goose, and duck can still be obtained in the market, but fresh beef and mutton are not abundant, and although chicken and duck are plentiful, the prices are strangely high, and the quality is old, thin, and poor, each costing five or six yuan in gold coins. The so-called price limits are ignored by merchants, and no one questions them.</p>
<p>A poet said: "One can eat without meat, but one cannot live without bamboo." "Meat" is used to highlight "bamboo," and dwelling is considered essential with "bamboo." This shows that "meat" is also an essential part of food. The Four Books state, "When Confucius heard the Shao music in Qi, he did not know the taste of meat for three months," using "meat" to praise the Shao music, and thus the status of "meat" is not low. Those who satirize officials say, "Those who eat meat are base," using "meat-eating" to represent "wealthy and powerful families," which has the same meaning as "behind vermillion gates, wine and meat rot, while on the road, there are frozen corpses." Not only in China, but also in the West, this is even more prevalent. Looking at wartime frugality, specific "meatless days" are designated each week, and rationing is not as vigorous as rationing "one pound of beef" and "half a pound of butter." The whole world is truly a "meat world"!</p>
<p>Confucians say, "A gentleman keeps away from the kitchen." It is also said, "Hearing their cries, one cannot bear to eat their meat." Buddhists believe that abstaining from killing is a blessing for humanity. Currently, the spirit of killing pervades the globe, with mutual slaughter and devouring. The lives of the people are in great peril, and life is treated like child's play. There are no intact nests, and no peaceful lin in the depths. How much different are humans from cattle, sheep, chickens, and pigs? The ways of Huang Chao and Zhang Xianzhong are widely practiced.</p>

<h3 id="e160">Recalling the Planning and Mobilization of the Past <a href="#e160" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c160" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">160</a></h3>
<p>— Weng Wenhao</p>
<p>The Double Tenth National Day is a day of great commemorative value in the minds of our national citizens. Let us imagine that before the founding of the Republic of China, China was under the control of thousands of years of imperial rule. All the officials of the imperial court were still there, and the army, specifically established to suppress the people, was well-trained and well-equipped. On the side advocating revolution, funds were extremely scarce, and weapons were lacking. Comparing the two sides, the material strength was vastly different. Undoubtedly, the revolutionary leaders were determined to save the country with fervent enthusiasm. They were unafraid of hardship and danger, persevering and undaunted, demonstrating a spirit of courageous advancement. They mobilized with great effort, without retreat, striving desperately to succeed. Finally, they succeeded in one fell swoop in Wuchang, creating the foundation for the Republic of China.</p>
<p>At that time, Shanghai bravely initiated reforms to boost morale, many provinces responded in unison, and the people of the whole country knew that the imperial system could not survive and the Republic of China must be established. It was only this belief of the majority of the people that was as firm as steel, causing the Qing Dynasty's civil and military officials to be fearful and apprehensive, possessing weapons but daring not use them, having power but failing to take effect, fleeing in droves, leading to complete failure.</p>
<p>It can be seen that the cause of the establishment of the Republic of China, in terms of material strength, was precisely using weakness to control strength, using poverty to defeat wealth. In terms of psychology, it was using righteousness to overcome wrong, using the new to replace the old. Moreover, comparing material strength with psychological belief, it was truly confidence that triumphed over material power. This is a fact of great value in history.</p>
<p>What was this indestructible confidence? At that time, the majority of the people accepted the leadership of the revolutionary leaders. Everyone deeply believed that the corruption and incompetence of the Qing Dynasty were the root cause of harming the country, and the imperial system, with its hereditary succession, was an outdated system. To save the country, it was necessary to innovate. Everyone recalled that after the Sino-Japanese War, foreign troubles were frequent, and China could not stand on its own without self-strengthening. They also recalled the Boxer Rebellion of the Gengzi year, which was reckless and destructive, and China could not become strong without innovation. Under this belief, once mobilized, everyone was of one mind, and this became the fundamental force for creating the Republic of China.</p>
<p>"Although Zhou was an old state, its mandate was new." Our country's new mandate entirely depended on this spirit of sincere upward progress. This confidence was also the main reason for our long-term resistance against Japan. At that time, after the Northeast fell in the September 18th Incident, Japanese aggression intensified, from the Northeast to North China, and then from North China to Central China, nibbling away like silkworms and devouring like whales, relentlessly advancing. Our country's territorial sovereignty was under grave threat. European and American allies were only seeking to protect themselves and made no promises to aid our country. Japan was strong and we were weak, the situation was obvious. However, our leader, the current President Chiang Kai-shek, resolutely decided to resist with military force, and the entire country supported him unanimously. A surge of activity arose, and everyone worked together, preparing for a long-term war to achieve final victory. Through years of effort, and after going through hardship, our lives were difficult but our spirit did not wane, and this ultimately caused European and American countries to admire and respect us, joining forces to wage war and force Japan to surrender. The land that our country had lost over the past fifty years, Taiwan and the Northeast, were all recovered and returned to our territory. This is a clear example proving that the people's confidence can ultimately achieve its goal. Where there's a will, there's a way; this is absolutely reliable.</p>
<p>What is deeply regrettable is that the country's path is full of difficulties. After winning the eight-year war of resistance, there was the disturbance of the Communist Party, which still caused smoke and dust to rise everywhere, and the people were unable to make a living. Last time, in order to clearly distinguish right from wrong and jointly face the national crisis, I already clearly stated that the Chinese Communist Party, since its establishment, has always been borrowing a name to destroy and devastate, becoming a fundamental disaster that shakes the country's economy and the people's livelihood. The necessity of our country's suppression of the rebellion is no less than the Xinhai Revolution and the war of resistance against Japan. In the past, the revolution and the war of resistance both achieved victory because of everyone's deep beliefs. The key to the success or failure of the current suppression of the rebellion also lies entirely in our fully strengthening our belief in certain victory.</p>
<p>The current practical difficulties are certainly particularly great, but comparing the current situation with the early stages of the revolution and the war of resistance, our government's organization, the army's equipment, the financial strength, and the convenience of transportation are all far above what they were in the past. We were able to win in the past, and we certainly cannot fail today. What I am concerned about is that the people's minds must thoroughly understand what is right and wrong and what is beneficial and harmful. They must not be swayed by the Communist Party's propaganda. They must unite sincerely and act consistently. They must not contradict each other, thereby reducing our own strength. They must be firm in their confidence and have no doubt. They must not ask the blind for directions and accept the other side's lies. On this Double Tenth National Day, I would like to encourage all compatriots across the country to not forget the loyalty, courage, and enthusiasm of the past, and to not neglect the important tasks of today's era.</p>

<p>Revolutionaries in Wuhan Rise Up</p>

<p>— He Yingqin</p>
<p>The work of revolutionary nation-building is of unparalleled difficulty and complexity. Thanks to the inspiring spirit of the Founding Father, the outstanding leadership of the President, and the courageous sacrifice of revolutionary martyrs and all the military and civilian compatriots, the revolutionary cause of the Three Principles of the People has been largely accomplished. Currently, the communist bandits are the last obstacle to the success of the revolution and the final stumbling block to the nation-building cause. We must all, with the ambition and spirit of revolutionaries, devote ourselves to the implementation of total war and the promotion of the frugal nation-building pact in our respective positions to sanction the treacherous and insidious communist bandits and ensure the victory of suppressing the rebellion and the success of nation-building. As long as the bandit scourge is eradicated, the country can enter a state of peace and prosperity, and our annual National Day commemoration will henceforth further promote its historical significance.</p>

<p>Fifty Bullets Overthrew the Qing Dynasty</p>
<p>The Wuchang Uprising was launched in haste, and various preparations and communications were not sufficient in advance, but the result was a success, which shows the trend of popular sentiment. In the thirteenth year of the Republic of China, the Premier said in his training speech at the Whampoa Military Academy:</p>
<p>At that time, there were only about three hundred revolutionaries in Wuchang and Hankou, and only a few dozen real revolutionaries. All the guns had no bullets. They searched everywhere temporarily, and there were only two plates of bullets, a total of only fifty bullets. The revolutionaries were divided into fifty bullets, and they launched an attack in the engineering camp in the city, and the artillery battalion outside the city immediately responded. ... The revolutionaries only used dozens of people to fight more than 20,000 people, which can be said to be one person fighting five hundred people..."</p>
<p>According to the first attack, the engineering battalion in the city was the Eighth Battalion's left team led by Xiong Bingkun. At that time, the three martyrs Peng Chufan, Liu Yaozheng, and Yang Hongsheng were captured and killed by Ruizheng. The party members in the army were deeply afraid of exposure, and everyone was on guard, and the organization had been cracked and the roster had been checked. There was no way to wait until all preparations were completed before launching the attack, so they launched the attack in haste. Unexpectedly, as soon as the gunshots rang out, all the troops responded, and the Manchu officials immediately fled with their heads in their hands, and did not encounter any resistance, and the Republic of China was created from this.</p>
<p>The Story of the Qing Dynasty's Doomsday Prophecy</p>
<p>After the success of the Wuhan Uprising, Yuan Shikai was ordered by the Qing court to lead his troops south. Yuan was very superstitious. Before leaving, he asked a fortune teller to predict the fortune of this trip. The fortune teller said it would be very auspicious, so he left. The Hubei Military Government then wrote to Yuan, advising him not to work for the Qing Dynasty, and also explained the principles of divination, which was very interesting and also a talking point in the history of the founding of the Republic of China. The original book was quite fearful, and the following are a few excerpts:</p>
<p>"...I heard that you are going south under the orders of the Manchu court this time (referring to the southern expedition to supervise the army on September 11), you declined repeatedly, hesitated and considered three times, and even with the urging of Ruan Zhongshu and Yin Mao, you still did not decide immediately, and then you summoned a fortune teller to predict it. The fortune teller said that this trip would definitely establish a great cause, and then you started your journey. The words of the fortune teller have no value. You probably listened to it because of your gains and losses. Although you have the wonderful use of a hero, it is not as good as the ancients who used three obediences and two froms. If you really predict the direction of the hearts of 400 million people today, you should realize that the so-called great cause should be in the Republic of China, not in the dying Manchu court.</p>
<p>Do you really believe in astrology and prophecy? Then the folk songs and ancient prophecies circulating in our country were estimated by the people with foresight, and their predictions have been clearly confirmed today. Why don't you examine them? For example, "Holding a steel knife ninety-nine, only when everyone is killed will they stop." Do you know how to explain it? We also didn't understand it at first, but after the Manchu court's edict on the 21st of last month, the words "revolutionary party" suddenly appeared in it. Our clever people pointed it out, and we suddenly realized that there was a test. The word "revolutionary" has nine strokes, and the word "party" has nineteen strokes, which is the so-called "ninety-nine." Isn't it more obvious that the Hu Dynasty is coming to an end? Another example is "Continuing the rule in a remote area for thirty-six, the flags are divided into eight sides to Qin Prefecture," which is also a secret prophecy. Today, someone has also made a judgment on it. "Rule" refers to Emperor Xuantong, as everyone knows. "Remaining in a remote area for thirty-six" means that he can live in a remote area for thirty-six months, which is a clear sign that the Hu Dynasty will end in the third year of Xuantong. "Thirty-six" is a variant of three years. "Flags are divided into eight sides" means that the Eight Banners are scattered, and "Qin Prefecture" does not refer to Guanzhong. Now that Guanzhong is owned by the Republic of China, how can the chariot of the Gengzi Incident be stationed there again? "Qin" is an incomplete pictograph of the two characters "Fengtian," which means that the Manchu emperor will eventually be displaced in this Fengtian with incomplete sovereignty. In recent days, letters have come from Beijing saying that the Manchu Empress Dowager will flee to Fengtian. Isn't this a pre-determined sign? However, this secret record was not originally intended by us to advocate to fool the people. It is just that we heard that you recently believed in astrology and prophecy, so we chatted about it to get a smile, and also to clarify a proof of the end of history.</p>
<p>"However, the above is by no means the reason for our uprising this time. Because you are confused by omens and are afraid of gains and losses, we do not hesitate to break the rules and say a word for you, hoping that you will know that destiny belongs to you early, or you will not act recklessly on your own clever plans, be deceived for life, and fall into the evil crime of losing your body and the public. This is the intention of Guan and others to enlighten you..."</p>

<p>(1) Articles of Association of the Revive China Society</p>
<p>The Revive China Society was founded in Honolulu in 1894, eighteen years before the founding of the Republic of China, and was the earliest Chinese revolutionary organization. At that time, ten articles of association were established, revealing its nature and purpose, the main points of which are as follows:</p>
<p>1. The name of the society should be correct. The name of this society is "Revive China Society," and the general assembly is located in China, and branch associations are located in various places.</p>
<p>2. The purpose should be clear. The purpose of the society is to connect Chinese people with lofty ideals at home and abroad, to study the science of wealth and strength, to revive China, and to maintain the national system. The reason why China's politics is becoming more and more non-existent, its principles are becoming more and more corrupt, and strong neighbors are despising the people is that everyone's hearts are not the same, and they only care about their current private interests, and do not care about the long-term overall situation. If China is divided by others, then our children and grandchildren will be slaves for generations, and their lives and property will not be guaranteed. There is nothing more urgent than this! But the whole country is indignant, but no one realizes it, no one saves it! Unite the wise and the foolish into one heart, unite the near and the far into one virtue, and pool our efforts to overcome great difficulties: then although China is in danger, it can be saved. The so-called people are the foundation of the country, and when the foundation is strong, the country is peaceful.</p>
<p>3. The ambition should be determined. The affairs to be determined by this society must be beneficial to the country and the people before they can be carried out: in order to assist the country above and achieve prosperity; and to protect the common people below and eliminate harshness. We must ensure that the 400 million people of China can each get what they want before we can be satisfied. If there are any who use this as an excuse to engage in fraud, form gangs for private gain, or divide boundaries and discriminate against each other, these are not the ambitions of this society: they should be resolutely eliminated in order to be fair and prevent abuses.</p>
<p>4. Personnel should be obtained. This society shall publicly hold personnel management once a year, and must select those with both good character and learning and those with comprehensive talent.</p>
<p>5. Friendship should be selective. This society shall only receive members who are recommended by two old members, and after the board of directors has judged that their hearts are bright, they are truly loyal and righteous, and they are sincerely concerned about their motherland and maintain China, so as to achieve a strong and prosperous place.</p>
<p>6. Branch associations should be widespread. People with lofty ideals from all directions can follow the articles of association and establish their own associations everywhere.</p>
<p>7. Talents should be gathered. This society is in urgent need of talents. Members are scattered in all directions, and they should always and everywhere seek out virtuous talents. Regardless of whether they are Chinese or foreign, if they are sincerely interested in benefiting the world and are willing to do their best for China, they can be admitted to the society.</p>
<p>8. Funds should be raised. The affairs managed by this society are of great importance, and a large amount of funds is required. Therefore, a silver association is specially established to raise funds to meet the urgent needs of the public and to provide a shortcut for shareholders to make money, which is a good deed that benefits both parties.</p>
<p>9. Public places should be established. Each branch association should establish a public place for members to work and for friends to talk from time to time, to discuss good methods for reviving China, to discuss current events, to study the politics of various countries, to express their own opinions, and to encourage each other to make progress. They must not engage in gambling games here, or do anything useless.</p>
<p>10. Flexibility should be good. Each clause is the outline for the opening of this society. Each branch association should make flexible changes according to local conditions and establish separate regulations to ensure that they are appropriate.</p>
<p>(2) Record of the Establishment of the Revolutionary Alliance</p>
<p>The Revolutionary Alliance was established in Tokyo, Japan, seven years before the founding of the Republic of China. According to Tian Tong's "The Establishment of the Revolutionary Alliance," an article in the first issue of the first volume of "Taiping Magazine," the establishment process is briefly described as follows:</p>
<p>In the summer of the year Yi Si, Sun Gong was about to come to Japan, and the comrades were excited. After arriving in Yokohama, Cheng Jiaquan conveyed the news again. Many students in Tokyo traveled between Tokyo and Yokohama. Sun Gong treated the virtuous with courtesy and also provided meals and lodging, personally holding a washbasin to wash the guests. The students in Tokyo held a welcome meeting at the Fujimiro, and many people attended. In the meeting, he gave a speech on the republican government. Wu Kun wrote it down, and the students were greatly moved, and the applause was thunderous. Then, a preparatory meeting of the Revolutionary Alliance was held at Cheng Jiaquan's residence in Iidamachi, with eight or nine people attending. They discussed various matters and the name of the society. Sun Gong advocated naming it the "Chinese Revolutionary Party," but Huang Gong said that this name would make it inconvenient for party members to act. After discussion, it was decided to name it the "Chinese Revolutionary Alliance." The oath format is as follows:</p>
<p>Oath taker, so-and-so from so-and-so province, so-and-so prefecture, so-and-so county, so-and-so, swears today to expel the Tartars, restore China, establish a republic, equalize land ownership, be faithful and loyal, and have a beginning and an end. If I violate this, I will be punished by the public. Member of the Chinese Revolutionary Alliance, so-and-so</p>
<p>Introducer, so-and-so</p>
<p>Heavenly Luck Year Month Day</p>
<p>The next day, a founding meeting was held at the residence of Uchida Ryohei in Hinokicho, Akasaka Ward, with more than 40 people attending. Everyone danced happily. Suddenly, Zhang Mingyi from Hunan said that the name was inappropriate and that the name should be established for the object since we have the ambition to overthrow the Manchu court. Sun said, it is not necessary, the Manchu government is corrupt, and we are therefore revolutionizing. Even if the Manchus sympathize with us, they can be allowed to join the party. Cao Yabo stood up and said, everyone advocates revolution today, and came here to start it. If there are any dissenting opinions, why come? Brothers, with a clear conscience, I will sign first, and everyone agreed, and each wrote an oath. The weather was hot that day, which was the 24th day of the sixth lunar month and the end of July of the new calendar. Uchida's servant brought cool cakes, and the comrades ate them heartily. In the laughter, the straw mat and wooden pillow were broken. The cups and plates were overturned, and some comrades fell to the ground. Sun Gong said, this is a sign of the overthrow of the Manchu government, and everyone rejoiced. Huang Xing, Jiang Zungui, Cheng Jiaquan, Ma Junwu and others were elected as drafters, and Sun Gong naturally participated in it. The main purpose of the regulations is to take the separation of powers, (1) the Executive Department, which is led by the Premier to manage affairs, and is divided into the General Affairs Department, the Secretariat Department, the Internal Affairs Department, the Foreign Affairs Department, the Accounting Department, and the Management Department. (2) The Deliberative Department, in which the councilors elect a speaker, and the speaker designates one councilor as the secretary. (3) The Judicial Department, with one chief, two judges, and one prosecutor. (4) Each provincial branch shall have one branch president. Several days later, a cadre election meeting was held at the residence of Viscount Banchamoto Kanemi in Reinan Saka. Huang Gong suggested that the comrades should consider that the position of Premier should belong to Sun Gong, which can save procedures and there is no need to vote. Everyone agreed, and Sun Gong was elected Premier, and Huang Gong was elected General Affairs. The remaining personnel of the Executive Department were gradually established, some were elected, and some were not elected. The councilors of the Deliberative Department were all elected at once, and the chiefs of the Judicial Department and the provincial branches were also elected later.</p>
<p>(3) Edict of Abdication of Emperor Xuantong</p>
<p>I, with reverence, have received the Edict of the Empress Dowager Longyu. Previously, due to the uprising of the people's army and the response from various provinces, the nine summers were boiling and the people were suffering. I specially ordered Yuan Shikai to send members to discuss the overall situation with the representatives of the Republic of China and to convene a parliament to make a public decision on the form of government. Since February, there has been no definite solution. The north and the south are separated and support each other. The negotiations have stopped on the way, and the soldiers are exposed in the wild. Only because the form of government is not decided for a day, the people's livelihood is not peaceful for a day. Now, the psychology of the people throughout the country is mostly inclined to the republic. The provinces in the south have advocated it in the past, and the generals in the north have also advocated it in the future. The direction of the people's hearts is known by Heaven. How can I bear to oppose the likes and dislikes of the people for the sake of the honor of one surname? Therefore, I observe the general situation externally and examine the feelings internally, and specially lead the emperor to return the ruling power to the whole country and set it as a republican constitutional government, to comfort the people in the country who are tired of chaos and hope for peace, and to learn from the ancient sages' meaning of the world for the public. Yuan Shikai was previously elected as Prime Minister by the Zizhengyuan. At this time of transition from the old to the new, there should be a way to unify the north and the south. Yuan Shikai should organize a provisional government and negotiate with the people's army on a unified plan, so that the people can live in peace and the country can be safe again. The five ethnic groups of Han, Manchu, Mongol, Hui, and Tibetan should still be completely integrated into a great Republic of China. I and the emperor can retreat to a wide and leisurely place, enjoy the years in peace, and receive the preferential treatment of the people for a long time, and witness the completion of Zhi Zhi. Isn't that beautiful? This is the order!</p>
<p>The date of the promulgation of the right edict was December 25, the third year of Xuantong, that is, February 5, the first year of the Republic of China.</p>
<p>(4) Zhang Puquan's Memoirs</p>
<p>Zhang Puquan's memoirs said: "On January 3, the third year of Xuantong, the Prime Minister went to Belgium. In May, I went to London. In the summer, I traveled to Switzerland with Wu Bigang, first living in Wengen, at the foot of the Jungfrau, and then moved to Grindelwald. In the autumn, the Wuchang Uprising broke out. The French were very excited to hear about the Chinese revolution. I took two or three friends and walked on the street. Four or five workers walked out of the hotel, took off their hats and shouted 'Long live China!' It can be seen that those who used to despise the Chinese have also changed their attitudes. I returned to China in November. When I arrived in Singapore, I heard that there were two factions in our party, one was the Revolutionary Alliance, and the other was the Restoration Society. I gathered people from both factions to drink together and explained the great righteousness. The main point is to avoid infighting among comrades on the day of the revolution's success. When I arrived in Shanghai, I heard that our army in Hankou had been defeated and the situation was very dangerous. Soon, the Prime Minister returned from overseas, and the morale was greatly boosted. I gave a lecture in a certain theater to raise funds for the revolutionary army. The women in the two boxes took off their gold and silver jewelry and threw them on the stage, which shows the excitement of the people's hearts. Ying Shi gathered wealthy merchants from Huzhou in a certain guild hall one day for the sake of raising funds, and closed the door, and they had to pay money. Ying Shi ordered me to give a speech."</p>
<p>(5) Provisional Grand President's Letter to Friendly Nations</p>
<p>Ever since the Manchus came to power, they have used supreme authority to impose unreasonable oppression, curtail civil rights, and resist public opinion. The intellectual, moral, and livelihood progress of our Republic of China has been delayed as a result. People of insight say that revolution is necessary to eliminate old filth and revitalize new opportunities. Fortunately, the banner of justice has been raised and the overall situation is about to be settled. We, the entire Republic of China, dare to announce to our friendly nations that we will overthrow the autocratic government of the Manchu Qing Dynasty and establish a republican republic.</p>
<p>Replacing the monarchy with a republic is not just a momentary anger of our people. Freedom is endowed by Heaven, and we have long yearned for it. We pray for lasting happiness and sweep away the obstacles in the future. We have cherished this small wish for a long time, but it has not been achieved. Today's events are the result of natural occurrence, and they are also the formal expression of the public opinion of our Republic.</p>
<p>Our Chinese nation is peaceful and law-abiding by nature. We will never lightly start a war unless we have no other choice but to defend ourselves. Therefore, since the Manchu Qing Dynasty stole China, for 168 years, the atrocities are too numerous to record. Our nation can only endure it and does not want to see the tragedy of bloodshed. We have risen up repeatedly, but it is difficult to achieve our goals. Today, we can no longer endure it, so we resort to force, hoping to free ourselves and our descendants from the shackles, and let freedom and happiness shine all over the world. It cannot be said that it is not a rare event in thousands of years.</p>
<p>The policy of the Manchu Qing government, to put it bluntly, is a tyrannical policy of jealousy of other races, selfishness, and unchangeable cruelty. We have suffered from it for a long time, and it is only natural that we have resorted to revolution. Destroying the old system and establishing a new country is something that we have to do. I would like to explain it to all the free nations of the world.</p>
<p>Before the Manchu Qing Dynasty stole the artifact, the civilized country of the Xia Dynasty allowed all countries in the world to communicate with each other and declare the freedom of religion. When the Ming Dynasty lost power, the Manchu barbarians came to power. Based on their narrow-mindedness and selfish prejudices, they set up various government orders to close themselves off and prevent the civilization of China from coming into contact with the countries of the world. As a result, the descendants of the gods are becoming more and more wild, and their natural abilities are difficult to develop. The people are imprisoned in ignorance. This is not only an obstacle to humanity, but also a public enemy of civilized countries.</p>
<p>Not only that, the Manchu Qing government wanted to keep the majority of the Han people permanently subservient to its autocracy, so that it could own wealth, cultivate and reproduce in it. Therefore, it did not hesitate to harm our people in order to benefit itself. The close relatives of the clan often had special privileges, and the majority of the civilians were subject to their control. It also levied exorbitant and illegal taxes and arbitrarily demanded them, which was close to robbery. It hindered the development of domestic business and hindered the prosperity of the colonial industry. The Manchu government did not know how to reward and protect the industry.</p>
<p>As for the use of people and administration, there is no principle of great justice. The harsh criminal system is inhuman. Selling official positions and granting titles, and politics is accomplished by bribery. The edicts are issued in the morning, and they are immediately violated in the evening, playing with our people, and it is not just once. Sitting and letting our country and our people be despised by the world, and they are almost unmoved by it.</p>
<p>We now want to eliminate the above-mentioned evils, so that our Republic of China can maintain friendly relations with all the countries in the world. Therefore, we do not hesitate to sacrifice our lives and fight against the evil government, and build a good one in its place. Therefore, I lay it out before the nations, and I hope that my friendly nations will take note of it. President of the Provisional Republic of China, I am related to Wen (signature).</p>

<p>The Mystery of Li Yuanhong's Coming to Power</p>
<p>After Wuchang was occupied by the people's army, the revolutionaries negotiated in the Consultative Bureau to form a military and political department and elect a governor. However, due to the suddenness of the incident, party members with qualifications such as Liu Zhongwen, Liu Ying, Huang Keqiang, and Juju were not in Wuchang. The leaders of the various armies were too young to be summoned, and the situation was urgent, so it was not appropriate to be without a leader for a long time. Therefore, Li Yuanhong, the "good old man" of the 21st Mixed Brigade, who was not a member of the Revolutionary Party, was elected as the governor. Li's coming to power was not voluntary. According to Wen Gongzhi's "History of the Founding of the Republic of China" and Zou Lu's "Draft History of the Chinese Kuomintang," Li was dragged out from under the bed of Li's house by the party member Jiji Min. Zhang Nanxian's "Records of the Hubei Revolution" said that he was found by Ma Rong and Tang Qifa in the bedroom of Li's staff Liu Wenji. However, the Englishman Edwin J. Dingle said in his book "China's Revolution 1911-1912": "The Chinese Revolution is one of the most shocking epoch-making events in the history of the world. If Li Yuanhong, who is currently known to everyone in the world, was not there at that time, the revolution may not have broken out. History proves that only Li Yuanhong is the greatest reformer in China and the world? ..." I don't know if this gentleman is unaware of the facts or deliberately distorting them. Because regarding this matter, Li Yuanhong himself once sent a letter to Sa Zhenbing afterwards, which said:</p>
<p>"When the Wuchang Incident happened, the troops under Hong's command had already gone out to defend, and he was guarding the empty camp alone and was helpless. After the Party Army drove Supervisor Rui out of the city, they immediately led a team to Hong's camp, surrounded and searched. Hong changed into casual clothes and hid in the room, but was arrested. He was charged with righteousness. At that time, guns and cannons were lined up all around. If he didn't obey, he would be killed. Hong had to agree temporarily. My teacher knows that Hong is the most cautious and honest. How dare he do this rashly? ..."</p>
<p>From this, it can be seen that Li himself also admitted that he had "hidden in the room in casual clothes" at that time. As for saying that he was dragged out from under the bed, it may be an exaggeration by later generations, which is also unknown.</p>
<p>Historical Stories of the National Name and National Seal</p>
<p>After the Xinhai Restoration, the party members had different opinions on the official naming of the Republic of China. Some advocated setting it as "Great Han Country," and some advocated setting it as "Great Han Republic," all of which came from the change of the four characters "Great Qing Empire." Some people also advocated setting it as "Chinese Republic." When the Senate was established, the name "Republic of China" was determined.</p>
<p>The earliest person to propose the name "Republic of China" was Mr. Zhang Taiyan. Zhang once wrote an article in the "Min Bao" entitled "Explanation of the Republic of China," in which he extensively cited and explained the four characters in detail. The article said:</p>
<p>"The name of China is used to refer to the four Yi tribes. India also calls Magadha China, and Japan also calls Sanyang China. This is not unique to the Han land. If we talk about the Han land in terms of the Han land, then the name of China is bounded by the prefectures and counties of the pre-Han Dynasty. ... The name of the Chinese people is used to refer to the place where the ethnic group first arrived. The world says that Kunlun is the Chinese country, which is obtained by analogy with other things. Whether the former emperors of China ever established their capital in Kunlun, there is no clear evidence in history, and it is not enough to use it as evidence. However, the spirit of the gods comes from the West, and takes Yong and Liang prefectures as the foundation. Fuxi was born in Chengyi, Shennong was born in Jiangshui, and the Yellow Emperor lived in Qiaoshan. These are all the lands of Yong Prefecture. Gaoyang started in Ruoshui, Gaoxin started in Jiangshui, Shun lived in Xicheng, and Yu was born in Shiniu. These are all the lands of Liang Prefecture. By observing the birthplaces of the emperors, we can know that the core area of the ethnic group is the root. The land of Yong Prefecture extends southeast to Huaxian. The land of Liang Prefecture extends northeast to Huayang. By defining the boundary with Mount Hua, and naming the country Hua, the origin is like this..."</p>
<p>It can be seen that Mr. Taiyan named the two characters "China." "China" refers to the different countries outside the four borders, and "Hua" is because the ethnic group originated in Mount Hua, so it is used as the name of the founding of the country.</p>
<p>As for the national seal, the alliance used old jade, with the text "Seal of the Republic of China," two inches and seven minutes high, and two inches and six minutes wide. It was treated by the jade master Lu, and at that time, Yuan Shuaifu's secretary Lian Shenghai was specially appointed as the ink official to supervise the work. After the victory, the national government returned to the capital in triumph, and the one held by Wu Wenchang was this seal.</p>
