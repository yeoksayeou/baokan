<h3 id="c26">進出口連鎖制如何實施 <a href="#c26" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e26" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">26</a></h3>
<p>據修正金圓券發行辦法第十條規定：凡持有金圓或金圓券者，得照政府管理外匯之規定，購買外匯。節項管理外匯辦法，關於進出口貿易部份，應依連鎖制制定之。依照這項規定，於是喧擾兩年餘之進出口連鎖問題，始獲得一決定性的解決。其尚待補充規定的，只是這項制度究應如何制定，卽關於施行的技術問題而已。</p>
<p>第一，如何連鎖　究竟採用混統的連鎖，抑或個別的連鎖。所謂個別的連鎖，卽硬性規定，某種出口貨必須掉換某種進口貨，例如本年二月閒，全經會會擬定：以紗布及絲織品，向南洋印度換取棉花米蔴及蔴製品，以桐油，豬　，礦砂，向美國換取交通器材等。我們認爲這種公式化的辦法，斷乎不宜採用。因爲國外市塲的需要和競爭情形，變化甚多，其權並不完全操之在我；而本國可供輸出的貨品，不諭其爲原料或製品，其產銷豐嗇情形，亦並非一成不變，不得不隨時伸縮，爲適宜的處置，例如紗布外銷，年來張弛不定，卽是一個明證。所以爲運用圓活起見，與其作　自縛，多加限制，不如採取概括的辦法爲妥。</p>
<p>第二，範圍應長江路限定所謂全面抑或局部的連鎖。目前進出口貿易，依舊在嚴格管理之中，似乎准許進出口的貨物，不應當限制其遵鎖·至於某種貨物，不許其輸出入，或應限制其輸出入，則在上項管理辦法中，不難明白規定，亦與連鎖的範圍無關。其應行限定的要點，應爲（一）進出口的金額必須可以相抵，不許數出浮於輸入，以免賢金的外逃，與（二）在某一時期以內，對於各種貨物，得調節其輸入總額，以免傷頗不均而巳。</p>
<p>第三，出口所得外匯應否准其轉讓凡主張不許總讓的，其着眼在避免發生黑市，避免刺激物價，其用心自無可厚非。但不知物價之所以彼動，其原因太多，並不限於黑市外匯這一端，而黑市外匯，在自由的外匯市塲沒有恢復以前，亦始終沒有能根絕過，正不必因噎廢食，一律禁止其轉讓。況進出口業各有專精，萬不能強制其兼營，而其本來兼營的，所輸入的貨物，亦並不一定是它本身所需要。所以出口商所得的外匯，除它自己兼做進口外，應准其自由轉讓，不必加以任何限制，而受讓的外匯，除了限期應輸入至少相等於所得外匯的許可貨物以外，亦不必加以其他的條件。因爲連鎖制度的唯一目的，乃在於國際間的物物交換，以濟外匯支細之窮；只須有等額的邀口貨來填補出口貨，其目的卽算達測，而初不在於辦進口的必須是原來的出口商。換句話說：總償的目標在貨，不在人。倘夾雜了人的作用在內，必將憑空添出許多麻煩和弊病來，其結果將大大地削弱了連鎖的功用。</p>
<p>第四，連鎖應否規定期限，這是一個十分緊要的問題，亦是一個相當困難的問題，因爲進口期限不先規定，出口商或騰利用物資，作爲逃避資金的企圖，而規定得過於短促或嚴格，亦或將桎梏出口，發生許多不便利·這暹由是十分明　的，海外市塲的時價，鎖路，競爭，或其他臨時的變化·爲出口商所不易預測的，其事例甚多，而各種貨物的耐久性和時令關係，亦互不相同。加以戰後物資缺乏，工潮迭起，各項定單，往往拖延日久，不是短期間內所能交貨。所以在實施連鎖時，如何規定一個合理的限期，使這項連鎖手續可以完全辦了，這確乎不是易事。有人主張，先辦出口，次辦進口；亦有人主張，出口時，應同時辦好進口的申請手續，這也不過對於出口外匯的逃避，和禁止入口的貨物，加以一種預防罷了。</p>
<p>第五，如何兼顧政府需要的外匯就恐怕出口的外匯，完全給進口商搶了去，政府將無法應付其龐大的支出了。其實出口的業務，私人固可經營，公家亦未嘗不可兼辦，過去中信局等辦理易貨，辦理外銷，其數量並不在少，不過政府所輸出的貨物，及其所得的外匯應否同受連鎖制的拘束，這當然是另一問題·而且僑匯部份，外幣外匯的移存部份，和可能的各種借款部份，這都不在進一出口的連鎖範圍以內，而在實施連鎖以很·進出口旣自行抵銷，政府已不須負担這筆鉅大的進口支出·因此政府所需要的外匯頭寸；似並無多大問題，有人認爲：（一）出口商所得外匯，除自辦進口外，如有餘額，仍應結歸央行；（二）政府於各項出口外匯中，不妨酌提一二成，以濟公用，這也似多此一舉。</p>
<p>我們對於連鎖這項制度，雖向來一貫主張，認爲是推廣諭出，和增加輸入的一個有效辦法；但也不過認爲有效辦法之一，其他仍應從多方面分別推進，以擴大國際貿易。因爲農村衰落，運輸阻滯，堪供出口的各種貨物，本已逐年減退，到十分零落的地步，而以物價飛漲的結果，與海外市價，又往往形成倒掛，加以國外原來的市塲，一再被人　奪，不容易恢復傳過來。所以進出口實行連鎖以後，如果過存奢望，認爲單靠這一項辦法，就可以把出口事業，立刻完全恢復起來，恐怕把這問題看得過於單純了。規在連鋇制的如何施行，正在擬訂之中，我們希望，這項細則，務須顧全事實，少生枝節，以免失去原意；同時，有關推廣出口的各項辦法，主管機關仍應採取積極態度，切實推動，以助連鎖制的不足。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕巴黎十七日廣播：伊伐特·賴依發表聯合聲明，再度籲請四强　速解決柏林危機問題。此項聲明在西方列强拒絕恢復四强談判之建議以後數小時發表。</p>
<p>〔聯合社巴黎十七日電〕美英法三國今日正式答覆聯大主席伊伐特及秘書長賴依之和平呼籲，指責蘇聯阻碍四國爭執之解決，主張柏林問題仍由安理會繼續處理。美國覆文重申在蘇聯封鎖威脅下，不願談判柏林問題，一俟封鎖解除，卽凖備與之談判。英國覆文則稱，蘇聯否決六中立國調解案，實妨碍柏林問題之解決。美國覆文係由國務部長馬歇爾簽發，內稱，美國曾將此事與蘇聯直接談判，直至明瞭蘇聯封鎖柏林係欲取得政治性之目標，蘇聯對此目標並無何種權利，吾人因將此問題作爲危害和平案提付安理會討論，現仍列在該會議程。柏林之爭，實牽涉聯合國憲章之基本原則，卽蘇聯政府是否得用武力，無論其爲封鎖或經濟壓力，以剝奪西方國家參加柏林管理權。伊伐特賴依兩氏，接閱三國覆文時未發表意見，據消息靈通方面稱，兩氏雖碰壁，仍當繼續調解。卽美國覆文亦稱，美國除準備參加安理會解決柏林問題外，並擬參加任何努力之顧及此問題所牽涉之基本爭端者，俾和平威脅得以解除，關係各方能誠意接受。</p>

<p>〔美國新聞處弗羅里達州凱威斯特十六日電〕杜魯門總統今日吿記者稱：美國對柏林問題之立塲并無變更，在蘇聯解除柏林之陸上封鎖前，美國將不與蘇聯談判柏林或整個德國問題。杜魯門稱：渠將於十一月廿二日（返抵華府次日）檢討國際全盤局勢，並將與國務卿馬歇爾及經合總署歐洲巡閱使哈里曼會晤，按哈氏今日返抵華府，將與各方作兩星期之磋商。總統稱：渠已獲悉伊伐特·賴伊提議，馬歇爾已草就答覆，并經渠本人批准。</p>
<p>記者以馬歇爾傳將辭職一事相詢，總統稱：渠與馬氏會晤時，將談及此事，馬氏自辭卸參謀總長一職後卽擬退休，其出任國務卿一職乃愛國心之驅使。答覆其他問題時，杜氏稱：渠並無派遣特使赴蘇計劃，渠太人亦不擬赴蘇與史達林會晤，但渠亟願在華盛頓隨時會晤蘇聯領袖。同時蘇代表維辛斯基對伊伐特·賴伊提議，已提出答覆，重申蘇聯十月三日致西方照會中之立塲。維氏稱：蘇聯同意伊找特·賴伊觀點，卽「柏林問題之解決，將影響其他問題之解決，諸如德奧日和約等問題」。蘇聯政府「亦認爲欲求國際關係之改善，各國領袖之個人接觸及互相信任實關重要」。觀察家指出伊伐特·賴伊提議，并未述及各國領袖之會晤。維辛斯基提出整個德國問題，而伊伐特·賴伊建議并未觸及整個德國問題，僅主張解決柏林問題而已。</p>

<p>〔法國新聞社巴黎十六日電〕根據討論中之計劃，柏林問題希望能在十二月二十日前解決。該計劃如得安理會之通過，則柏林水陸封鎖應在四十八小待內開放，而運輸限制應在九十八小時內取消。同時蘇區馬克卽推行至整個柏林，作爲柏林之唯一貨幣。關於統一幣制與開放交通事，各方面之技術問題應在十二月二十日前取得協議。據悉，中立國方面又擬在柏林設置一聯合國特委會，監視統一幣制與取消封鎖之進行，特委會待安理會計劃完全完成時撤消。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕政府向香港暫借食米九千八百噸，由怡和公司配裝五千噸，太古公司裝四千八百噸，第一艘怡和澤生輪所載一千七百噸，昨午抵埠，泊公和祥碼頭起卸。</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕本市糧食會報，於昨午四時在市府會議室舉行，由吳市長主持，出席各有關機關代表十餘人。據悉：怡和澤生輪業已抵滬，裝到港米一千六百噸，又招商局中興輪亦已到滬，運來台米五百噸，今日起卽可提貨，會間曾討論起卸技術問題。又悉：本　市十月份配米，決於本月二十五日前全新配淸。十一月份配米，則決於十二月五日起開始配售。</p>
<p>本市民食供應，因近日各地阻運情形略有改善，來源漸暢，其嚴重時期業已過去。十月份配米現已大部運到，所缺約三萬餘石，在二十日前準可抵達。十一月份配米，糧食緊急購儲會卽將開始籌劃。據悉：迄今爲各地方當局扣留之本市配米，其中數額較大者有浙江一萬石，該批食米原議定以肥料交換，肥料且已運交浙省府接收，惟浙省府堅持「扣頭」五千石，以「八一九」限價仍由浙省府購回，致僵持未決。此外贛省供滬五萬石，至今亦僅准運六千餘石，以上扣米正由有關當局繼續交涉中。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕本月上半月職工生活指數，業經市府發表爲八·一倍，資方頗多認爲倍歡太高不勝負祖，但亦有一部份職工仍認爲過低，對於是項生活指數之編製方法表示懷疑者。社會局吳局長昨特發表談話稱：是項指數係根據實地調查而來，在發表前並經共同審核通過，當時總工會代表雖曾一再質詢，經與會人解釋後亦卽表示諒解。惟自本月一日限價開放後，市塲波動情形殊越常規，又以在此期內一部份貨品供應不足，貨主漫天討價，並無標準，不免予人以深刻之印象，而核其實際，却往往有行無市，並非悉屬實際成交，此等虛盤自不能作爲統計之依據。至生活指數內各項物價之調查日期，例爲星期二及星期五，均由市府統計處派員實地調查，其中菜蔬米麵等項，並以實際採辦方式以買進價作爲當日之價格，確實信而有徵，與漫天討價之虛盤不同。吳局長並稱是項指數之調查及編製，雖由市府統計處主持辦理，但在此市面極不正常之際，渠爲鄭重準備起見，亦曾派負參加調查以期周密，是項工作人員均備有徽章，易於識別，各貨主於討價時或比較審愼不敢過份抬高，當亦係事實。吳局長表示在過去米荒極度嚴重日期，米價雖嘗狂跳飛漲，市民感到極大威脅，但廠家對於職工頗多借發米糧或酌撥實物以資調劑。又工人於十一月份大部預支工資一個月並准暫不扣還，對於工人生活均不無小補。在此物價調整時期，指數編製之結果，見仁見智，勢難盡如各方之理想，吳局長深盼勞資雙方仍太過去合作之精神切實參照辦理，以泯糾紛。</p>

<p>本案昨爲第五度審理，庭上前應被吿孫繼策等之請，昨傳到證人蘇州電氣公司經理張賓桐出庭訊。據張向庭上述稱：該公司每月需煤三千至三千五百噸，爲求配煤獲得便利起見，去年底及今年初，曾先後兩次在本市杏花樓及國際飯店，宴謂孫處長等，今年春孫繼策全家赴蘇州遊玩，並在蘇設宴招待，臨去贈有土產等多種。</p>
<p>相當百擔米價</p>
<p>繼復稱：卅六年底，孫處長派人至蘇，向渠借款買米一百擔，當時渠以公司經濟拮据，且屆年關，予以婉辭·詎今年一二兩月份配煤，燃管會藉口北寗路不通，配額卽予减少，且須赴京領煤，公司以用煤至急，迫不獲已，乃乘舊歷年關之便，致送孫處長新華銀行本票一億元（當時相等於一百擔米之價），三月後配煤，恢復原額。今年九月二十二日，孫處長稱友人需款一千金元，亦經派人立卽送去。庭上以此詰孫，孫連稱係以手錶一隻所換，而張則當庭否認，孫乃支吾其詞稱：「錢是張經理自動送的」。繼詢林克楹關於張實桐請客送錢事，林否認收款，但供認曾應邀赴國際飯店及收受土產。嗣將其他各被吿審訊一過，乃開始辯論。</p>
<p>提供檢舉意見</p>
<p>首由市政府調查股長樂壯新，就承辦本案之立塲，提供檢舉意見數點：（一）本案是官商勾結貪汚，燃管會主要工作在管制燃料，調劑有無，法善意美，但執行者則乘機囊括，正當煤商大受影響，而黑巿煤斤，亦由此造成；（二）被吿戴偉華，徐葆光，任輝等，在會任內勤工作，不管對外事務，雖有受賄行爲，但渠等並不自知其所得者爲何，其犯罪行爲較輕，（三）毛梅軒部份，代辦煤斤五百噸採購證，其中有百分之二佣金，毛實不知，故毛如有過失，在於代辦採購證；（四）孫志剛爲江浙輪船公司庶務，僅係奉命代送賄禮而已；</p>
<p>貪汚證據確鑿</p>
<p>（五）韓顧溥受人委託，代各輪船公司賣煤，係商業性質，且並非由渠本人買進，不能構成貪汚罪；（六）關於楊耘夫，孫繼策，趙伯鈞，林克楹，鄒濟道等五被吿，貪汚證據確撃，應請依法辦理。至午退庭，下午一時繼續開庭，卽由蒞庭檢察官鄭衍鈞起立申述起訴意旨後，各被吿辯護律師潘震亞等依次辯論，庭上最後並對各被吿一一詢問，遂定期於二十四晶定判，楊耘夫等十一人還押，孫志剛飭回·</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕中國航空公司計劃開闢之中日航綫，於上月底卽有開航之訊，但迄今尙未實現。茲悉，此一計劃已決定暫時擱置，因該航綫開闢之主要目的，乃在吸引駐日美軍人員來華遊歷，但目前國內戰局方股，美國正忙於撤僑，東京美方人士當無意於此時此際來華遊歷，故中日航綫之開闢，將無意義，中航公司乃決定擱置云。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕私立中小學聯合會昨日下午在市敎育會召開理監事會商討增收學雜費問題，敎職員亦派有代表參加。各敎職負發言熱烈，認爲公敎人員待遇立法院已通過調整，與私校相差甚遠，故追收額要求超過四倍。李局長列席勸導，最後會議仍決定追收額以不超過原額四倍爲原則，收費名義由各校自定。</p>
<p>據李局長向記者表示：渠對追收四倍學雜費事從不同意。補助敎職員生活淸苦之方式應由校方邀請學生家長與敎職員共同商討，視家長經濟能力自動捐助，不能硬性規定倍數徵收。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕本市各公私立大專學校校長於前日敎部杭次長談話會中對本市本學期統一獎學金之核發過遲曾有批評，各私立大專校長並決議放棄不要。上海市獎學金統一審核委員會總幹事鄭傑昨特發表談話如下：（一）本學期獎學金比較遲發之原因，實在於各校未能按時將申請表或免費學生名册送達本會，如大夏大學申請表迄今尙未送來，滬江大學申請表於取回重審後亦迄未送會。至中小學方面，迄今未送免費學生名册者尙有法學院附中等多校，致使大會審核工作大受影響。（二）太會潘主委公展李副主委熙謀一向主張獎學金核發手續應迅速辦理，故於其他公務百忙之中，對太會來往公文莫不提前予以批閱，至本人及本會所屬職員四人，除竭力趕辦會務外，自問並無延誤之處。（三）本學期獎學金雖由各團體於八月二十七日在國際飯店分別認捐，但所有捐款並不能卽時收齊，截至目前止，尙有若干團體未將捐款送來。至於獎學金之保管，除由認捐團體自行保管者外，其餘概由本會於收到後卽刻解存市銀行。又本會向市銀行提款手續，須憑李副主委及本人之印鑑，潘主委對本會捐款之收支，則向不經管。再本會之任務，原爲公私立各級學校淸寒學生盡一分責任，卽銀行存息亦通盤撥作獎學金之用，惟目前金圓貶値，初非意料所及。（四）公私立專科以上學校淸寒學生，本學期獎學金業經本會分別函請各校具領轉發，並已有立信會計專科等多校將款領去。至於本會及各捐款團體發放獎學金手續，爲愼重計，故稍嚴格，諒爲各校所同情也。</p>

<p>又訊：棉紗市塲咋暫停交易一天，塲內均未做開，其暫停原因，爲入塲證尙未掉換齊備，自開巿後數日來，前門未開，入塲人員，均由後門進出，當局對此加以糾正，故昨日交易暫停，蒞塲人員均在塲外喊做，市况均較昨日盤小。</p>
<p>昨日棉布塲外喊價承隔日之疲勢，賡續下挫。十二碼能頭細布初喊三百元，曾小至二百九十元，嗣以銀根吿鬆，客帮乘低力進，本街實銷，亦來補吸，有貨者聞米糧上揚，大都不肯輕售，午刻行情步高至三百二十元結束，較上日回好十元。四君子元嗶嘰亦好十五元，爲三百三十元，收後聞紗價趨跌，人心又疲，龍頭細布三百二十元乏人問津。</p>

<p>— 本報特派員　儲裕生</p>
<p>〔本報杭州十六日訊〕由杭州循杭徽路西行，經餘杭而達臨安，這一路，記者曾於卅五年夏末來過，當時公路傾圯，城鎭幾已全毀砲火，斷坦殘壁，慘不忍覩。這次蒙中電一廠「尋夢記」外景隊之邀，得能舊地重遊，而這兩年的闊別中竟使坍壞了的公路，變成了平坦，紊亂的地方，變成有秩序，尤其臨安縣的新興市政建設，將破敗了的縣府署興建了新型宏麗的縣政府署，坍毀了的街道築成了平坦的馬路，燒拆幾已殆盡的房屋重又在馬路兩旁建造了起來。最可貴的在臨安城裏竟找不出一個要飯的叫化子，商店在早上六時開市，入晚十時始休，在目前經濟動亂的情形中，眞是城市中所僅見的世外桃源。</p>
<p>本年豐收八成半</p>
<p>餘·臨·於·昌各縣，今年也·是豐收，臨安有八成半以上，最好的收入是茶葉，因爲今年龍井茶葉暢銷，茶商都來臨安採購茶葉，充作龍井茶出售。其次是絲藕，今年繭子賣得起錢，一担足可掉得好幾担米，笋尖也是盛銷，沙桃靑荳之類雖產量不多，但也有很好的收入。由於農村中生產的物資價値的提高，保障了臨安的安寗。</p>
<p>縣長楊維禮吿訴我：「縣政想辦好，必須充裕稅源，充裕稅源，必須要革除稅弊，臨安還捐稅時，凡我自己應還的捐稅首先還納，這樣的作法使大家不好意思不還納了，如果再有故意不過的，那就要嚴辦。因此，臨安的賦谷，房捐，營業稅，屠宰稅，收來都是相當的好。</p>
<p>貸予經費建房屋</p>
<p>「關於地方上的建設事業，決不向地方上攤派，例如興建縣署，是利用兩年來縣政的積餘，修築馬路也是動用這一筆錢，馬路兩旁的店屋，是由縣府半數貸給他們經費，以榖爲對象，每担利息祗須還穀一斤，可以分期償還。老百姓感於如此便宜，自然都營建房屋了。</p>
<p>「鄕村道路都已完成，是利用農閒時的勞動服務，電話全縣也已架設完竣，小型農田水利，只要由人民申請，縣府踏勘屬實，設計後卽無條件貸穀興修」。</p>
<p>九區專署譚專員</p>
<p>臨安是浙省第九區專員公署的所在地，專員譚乃大，是曾經任過師長的。他吿訴我：「這一年來，九區沒有什麼事。」依臨安的情形看來，確是很安寗，農胞也很能過得去。</p>
<p>臨安擁有東天目山之勝，（按於潛有西天目，記者曾於卅五年遊過並曾爲文報導，）離臨安縣城約四十里，由城通往東天目山的路，是由縣府發動勞動服務所興建，可以行駛汽車，路面雖不及公路好，但以縣的能力來開發此路，並沿路有好幾個艱險的特工，也是不太容易。</p>
<p>抵東天目上山去</p>
<p>我們曾去東天目山，沿路卽見一叢叢的樹林，一堆堆的房屋，一頭頭的耕牛，一羣羣的鷄鴨，田間都已收割，柴草堆得很有秩序，茶林上開滿白色的茶花，竹子迎風細語。</p>
<p>到東天目山脚下，步行里許，拾級登山，凡爬攀半里，卽有平路一段。抵三里亭，俯望山下，靜靜的村落如畫，紅葉扶疎，參雜着嫩黄深綠的枝葉。</p>
<p>再上抵四里亭，五里亭，隔山見一懸瀑，長十餘丈，五里亭以上。人在山谷之中，引吭一吼，羣山響應。這時，看見了漫山遍野的紅葉，血一樣的杜鵑花，像紅豆一樣的天竹子，松木幽纂佔據了四面的山間。</p>
<p>昭明禪寺如仙境</p>
<p>再爬四里許，見大樹林立，均合數抱·前行，有石橋一座，古色斑駁，蘚苔滿階。橋旁有亭，橋前有石壁，掛有懸瀑，越橋洞而下，入深澗。過橋拾級而上，山旁有亭，再上，巨木成林，林下有石道通往昭明禪寺，一聲之宏大的鐘聲，敲入了心坎深處，比時如入「仙境一。</p>
<p>廟很大，可容千人，佛像不若靈隱淨慈之宏偉，惟自富陽等縣來還願燒香者很多，皆宿於寺內。據老和尙說：「戰前有電燈，電機爲梅蘭芳所捐，蔡元培也曾來此。」我們曾赴昭明太子洗眼處之洗眼池，昭明太子在東天目編經，至雙眼失明，至洗眼池洗眼獲得重光故名。由此遙望，見羅漢松長在對面的山巓。</p>
<p>中電拍片尋夢記</p>
<p>我覺得東天目之勝，是在俊麗，西天目則古樹參天，另有一番雄偉的氣象。中電一廠曾在此攝有新聞片「天目之秋』，後以此外景特佳，故此次特來此攝「尋夢記」外景，「尋夢記」寫一新聞記者的故事，由唐煌導演，杜驪珠主演。縣長很熟心，帮同他們設法解決食·宿·住的問題。？</p>
<p>縣長還對我說：「預備另外築一公路，通往西天目」。則東西天目均可由臨安往遊了。</p>
<p>在臨安兩日，確覺這縣治很安寧，希望她在安寧中格外爭取進步。</p>

<h3 id="c126">從匪部兵力與戰略上看　徐蚌大會戰 <a href="#c126" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e126" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">126</a></h3>
<p>— 楊力</p>
<p>〔時代社訊〕徐蚌會戰是黄泛區會戰以後，在華中地區又一次兵力最大的會戰，在此以前的一兩個月以來，共匪在兩淮地區卽積極活動，地方土共成了兩淮軍區，由匪十二縱隊司令員陳慶先任軍區司令員。土共金少山·魏鳳樓·趙匯川·孫傳家匪部，每股由數千人發展到一兩萬人，企岡侵佔津浦兩側地區，和淮河兩岸地區，打通到大別山的走廊，以爲將來匪主力南來時打下基礎，所以黄泛區會戰以後·劉伯誠便在此地留下了種子。蘇北匪軍在國軍進剿以後，兩個縱隊已竄回魯南，一個縱隊仍留蘇北，鹽阜地區始終未肅淸，而土共地方團隊在江北岸又不斷活動。在徐蚱會戰之前，魯南兩個縱隊又回竄蘇北，東台被陷後，匪企圖繞犯兩泰，孤立高郵·寳應·在洪暹湖以西牽制國軍的行動·南下的匪軍又經連沭地區竄至（河）泗（縣）靈（璧）鳳（陽）和旴眙·天長，配合兩淮匪軍，完成對蚌埠的包圍圈，這雖然大部是土共的活動，而對後方的交通影饗很大，其企圖不能忽視。</p>
<p>再從匪部正規軍的兵力和調動來看：陳毅有五個兵團，共十六個縱隊，可能用到徐蚌的有十一個縱隊，分佈在魯南，津浦正面，和魯西。劉伯誠有十二個縱隊，可能用到徐蚌的有六個縱隊，一部在魯西，一部在豫東。陳賡有四個縱隊在豫西，可能有兩個縱隊東竄。總共起來，匪部參加徐蚌會戰的總兵力最大限度是十九個縱隊到邪惡一個縱隊，人數在三十五萬到四十萬之問集合三股共匪的主力，其規模也不會大於遼西會戰。國軍的兵力經集結後，約倍於匪軍兵力以上，再加上交通運戰的方便，其機動性更大於匪軍，所以以劣勢兵力發動攻勢，這在共匪的戰略上是不允許的。「不打無把握的仗」，是共匪一再强調的，在徐蚌會戰裏，他還能用「人海戰術」去拼麼？因此，徐蚱會戰，正面的決戰機會很少，匪的攻擊方式可能採取這樣的辦法：第一，從魯南南下，經過徐（州）海（州）之間，衝斷徐淮（陰）交通，進入倒洪澤湖西岸威脅蚌埠，或更進擾蚌埠以南。第二，從魯西繞過黃泛區，進入淮北，配合地方土共竄入淮南，威脅徐蚌左翼。第三，從豫鄂邊境東來一股，重竄大別山，進到皖西，威脅巢湖地區。粽合來看，匪軍是以津浦南段爲戰略攻擊中心，在猛衝猛打後，可能採取「擴面」「孤點」「斷綫」的戰法，在兩淮地區和洪澤湖兩岸來一個長期困擾。又可能出一支步兵在鄂皖贛之間渡江，進擾蘇皖浙地區，以威脅京滬後方·在武漢外圍，或平漢南段也可能發動一種牽制性的戰鬥，所以徐蚌會戰是江河之間一次決定性的會戰，此一決戰可以決定江淮之間的局面·同時這一戰塲就在京滬的外圍，也可以看作京滬的保衛戰。國軍是抱定有勝無敗的決心，時間上已準備了兩個月，戰略上已放棄不必要的負担，只要國軍主力完整，點綫的出出入入不能決定全局。這一塲決戰，如果能殲匪主力過半，此後黃河以南放棄的點綫雷新收復是指顧問的事。現在的問題，是國軍有信心殲匪，就看京滬的市民，能不能給前方戰士以精神的或物質的援助，尤其是後方自己先求穩定，一個勝仗打下來，什麽問題都解決了·京滬保衛戰就在此一舉！</p>

<h3 id="c133">竊嬰事件 <a href="#c133" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e133" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">133</a></h3>
<p>— 雷霆</p>
<p>最近津市曾發生一件竊嬰案，其主角則爲偽裝懷胎九側月的少婦韓郭鴻悌（見本月十四日本報）。在生活極度困難的今天，該少婦所竊盜的，不是金錢，不是食用品，反而是頗爲累贅的嬰孩，這又無怪一般人認爲「怪」，甚至有人以爲這是頗具幽默感的喜劇了。</p>
<p>這確是一幕現成的喜劇材料。因爲它似乎具備了輕鬆，幽默而又有點出人意料的成份。然而這祗是局外人的看法。在主演者韓郭懷悌的內心里，她不但不會絲毫感覺到上述的氣氛，反之，她是在緊張·恐怖·刺激的情緒中，來演出這一幕表面似乎是喜劇，而其實是道地的悲劇的。因爲這一事件的主動者，不是實地行竊的韓郭鴻悌，也不是她的家屬－如翁姑丈夫之類。它的眞的導演者，是一種看不見摸不着的潛勢力，極其堅强地深伏在一般人內心里的潛勢力。一句話：是在我國傳統了幾千年的封建制度的餘毒。。</p>
<p>這一餘毒的註解，見於聖賢的經典的，是：「不孝有三，無後爲大」；是：「母以子貴」，是：「……：無子者，出」·在過去，卽使是現在，國人們的傳統思想，一向是慣於把一切罪名推在弱者的身上的。（最近，我們不是還看見「弱者，你的名字是女人」的電影嗎？）因而「不孝」的罪名，負資者是女人；因爲無「子」而其身不「貴」的罪名，負責者也是女人；甚至被「出」的罪名，負資者當然又是女人了。「實命不尤」，與丈夫當然無涉。</p>
<p>例如「無子者，出」這一條，現在似乎已沒有構成離婚的條件了。但作丈夫的却能捧出「無後爲大」的大帽子，作爲本身納妾的理由。從法理言，固然牴觸了現行法律，但這位違法的丈夫，却很容易獲得家屬們的原諒和同情，社會的原諒和同情，甚至他的妻子的原諒和同情。像這類事，這位妻子雖沒有公開地被「出」，却不是等於半公開的被「出」嗎？而這類事件，像我們四十多歲的人，耳聞目覩的也眞不少。</p>
<p>根據上述的分析，再加上我們可能的聞見，我們對於這位喜劇的主演者的內心的苦痛，可以略見一斑。因而我們便不能單看見輕鬆的表面，而忽略了酸痛的內容了。</p>
<p>我們現在不妨再咀嚼咀嚼這事實的過程。一，她「偽充懷孕，自二月間開始以來，迄今已達九月餘」；二，她「曾迭赴馬大夫醫院，請求欲得一嬰兒，未果」；三，她「十日再赴該院，情急智生，遂在嬰兒室偷抱一嬰兒走出」；四，她「偽稱表妹所生，入同德醫院住院」。（原文俱見本報）</p>
<p>這是她在這一幕喜劇的表演的經過。從這經過里，可以看出她是如何的苦心孤詣。但誰爲爲之，孰令致之？我們能再把喜劇的心情來看她？能再把竊盜的罪名加她的身上嗎？</p>
<p>這事件在法律上她該受怎樣的處罰？我不懂。但如果說，她有應得的罪名，則這罪名正該歸諸於封建制度的餘毒！</p>
<p>居今日而仍有這類事，怪誰？</p>

<p>做公務員除了特任官不論資格以外，其他呢，由僱員起而至簡任職，都是要講資歷的。主管人事的根據了資歷，纔可以呈報上級機關銓定職薪。然而這一張「公務員履歷表」所開列的項目，却使初入仕途的人感到非常麻煩。</p>
<p>姓名·別號·性別，住址（分現在永久），出生，要寫明民國紀元年月日現年幾歲，黨籍，宗教信仰也要塡明。醫生檢驗體格，分：身長，眼耳左右，胸圍盈虛差，四肢，心臟，血壓，體格特徵，肺臟，其他，總評等。家屬分氏名，年齡，存歿，職業·附註。學歷要塡明學校或訓練機關名稱，院系科別，修業起訖年月，畢桀或肄業，學位。考試也分年屆及名稱，種類科別，等第，證書字號，考試機關。著作或發明的名稱，學術類別。關於專長，志趣，或受過獎懲的也要寫明，照片要附四張。</p>
<p>派職叙薪，要靠經歷，所有以前的經歷都要塡報，惟在民十六以前在北京政府統治下任職的資格不能寫入，寫入也不算數的。經歷是分服務機關名稱，職別，擔任事務，級俸，到職年月，卸職年月，證件名稱等。最要的是卸職證件，若果只有到職派令而無卸職證件，那就卽使幹了十年八年的長久職事，也只作一個月算。還有銓叙經過，來腿等塡明，沒有的，自然可以不塡。而一履歷表中除了本人簽字蓋章之外一，還要機關長官及人事主管人員一的簽名蓋章，同時並要兩個較本一人職務高的公務員簽具保證書，纔算辦妥手續，正式做公務員。</p>
<p>高中程度畢業，初次叙薪爲七十五元，專科以上是一百四十元。如由大學畢業起想着做到薦任職，要七年，做到簡任職要十七年。這些年數並要工作沒有中斷，而能考績晋級的爲準。不然，儘管是任某職支某級薪，是屬本機關的事，銓叙是通不過的。</p>
<p>僑務，蒙藏等委員，和各機關的秘書長秘書等，資格不限定，這是特殊的。</p>
<p>爲了抗戰的證件失落，如有校長敎員或同學或前任長官同事等的證明，可以作正式證件，但須要出具證件人的服務機關加蓋印信。因爲有此變通辦法，假證件便不計其數了。有些人爲了情誼「與人爲善」，便代證明某人曾任某職支薪若干等，人事管理員明知其中的假偽，也多不予追究。因此一來，抗戰期間，造成了無數公務員的資薪增高。如有眞的遺失證件，無法得着證明，而被降級的，這眞是「活該」，與人無關。</p>

<p>— 細侯</p>
<p>「最瘦者秋霜」。幼時聽了這句話，對於秋霜的虛殺凜冽，印象深切。比近中年，不惟草枯木脫，節候驚心；卽　玉炊珠，衣寬帶剩，亦重有感于秋霜般的世味了。</p>
<p>其實，自然界的霜是莊嚴而美麗的。雖沒有雨聲那麼活潑，月色那樣隨和；但當晴秋早起，推窗一望，萬瓦鱗鱗，白黑參差，宛然圖案，髣髴上了一堂美術課。此時坊陌　寂，唯林梢乾鵲，一啅初陽。少頃，晨曦洒屋，微痕暗消，背陰處越顯得濃白。一淸早，肯欣賞這種景片的，恐也不多。</p>
<p>深秋曉霧，步行田野，披着滿身霜屑，踏着堅凍的泥土，折草殘礫間，脚印淺留，漸覺日出霧稀；襟袂冰溫，疎林紅翠，細徑綿延，柴扉閉寒，茅　凝白。「無人山寂寂，落葉一聲乾」。這是舊時山居早起的斷句。獨恨未臨邊關絕塞，一聞箱天曉角。</p>
<p>曩客漢口，初學　詞，曾拈「翠樓吟」調咏霜，題目很新，少有人作，後閱「蕙風詞」有此題，貴州詩人周漁璜集中亦有「一字至七字詩詠霜」，結句爲「不銷惟有鏡中央」。拙詞記得有「飛魂一縷，趁小鬢黄花，和香黏住」。又「悵板橋人遠，再尋無據」。俱極稚弱·當時曾請敎汪珠浦先生，並蒙賜和示範，今默記汪詞於下：</p>
<p>塞雁馱哀，堦蛩話冷，西風瘦黃花處。棲裊驚月稔，咽笳語，曉寒偸度。香心縷縷，問小小雲英，幾曾兜住？亭臯趣，　林緋纈，指紅砧女。認取，淺草塘坳，有小鴛先到，曉痕添據。竊紅楓葉了；又偏是白收蘆絮。娥眉暗妒，算關罷嬋娟，月羞斜去。天應許，謾欺潘　，負奮戀舞。（翠樓吟）</p>
<p>今隔十九年，飽歷冰霜世故，久已危苦無詞。秋風海上，極目蕭條，感舊懷人，不自覺其鬢星星矣。</p>

<h3 id="e1">National Army on Pinghan Railway Advances North, Attacking Zhengzhou and Kaifeng, Completely Changing the Battle Situation South of the Yellow River; Annihilation Battle Underway Near Suxian <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Bengbu Dispatch, 17th] According to reliable military sources: The main force on the Pinghan Railway is advancing north. The Huang Corps from Fuyang is crossing the Ying River and advancing north. The two routes will advance separately and strike together, attacking Kaifeng and Zhengzhou, cutting off the Longhai Railway, blocking the retreat of the bandit troops committing aggression in Xuzhou, and annihilating them in a decisive battle.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper Xuzhou Dispatch, 17th] In this great victory of the Xuzhou campaign, the National Army routed Chen Yi. Chen Geng and Liu Bocheng's sixteen columns were defeated, with over 100,000 bandits killed or wounded. This is equivalent to dealing a devastating blow to the main bandit forces between the Yangtze and Yellow Rivers. The bandit army south of the Yellow River will have no strength to make trouble within half a year. This is not only enough to stabilize the Jianghuai region but is also the key to reversing the entire battle situation. Currently, the National Army's land and air forces are fiercely pursuing and annihilating the fleeing bandits, intercepting and encircling them. The battle situation south of the Yellow River is about to undergo a complete change. Nearly 20,000 bandits surrendered to the National Army on the 16th, and a large number of weapons were seized.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper Nanjing Dispatch, 17th] Military News Agency urgent telegram from the Xuzhou front at 6:00 PM on the 17th: The annihilation battle with Suxian as the center of gravity on the southern front is currently underway. The National Army on the southern route is advancing north along the Jinpu Railway. After recovering Guzhen, they are pursuing the victory. The vanguard has advanced to Qiaoche Station, heading towards Suxian. Furthermore, the rapid advance of the elite forces of the National Army moving south along the Jinpu Railway is also extremely rapid. The bandit army in the area near Suxian is being attacked from the north and south by our forces. Their morale is gradually collapsing, and they are already showing signs of fleeing.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper Nanjing Dispatch, 17th] Military News Agency urgent telegram from the Xuzhou front at 8:00 PM on the 17th: The National Army's Sun Corps launched a mopping-up operation on the 17th afternoon in the area within 20 li southeast of Xuzhou, completely annihilating the entire 20th Regiment of the 9th Division of Chen's Third Column, and then occupying the high ground at Xushan, Yangshantou, Wanjaying, and Tengjiazhai.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency Xuzhou Dispatch, 17th] Approximately two divisions of bandits advanced from both sides of the Jinpu Railway towards Weijiahe, Fengyuan, southwest of Pantang Town, which is more than 20 li southeast of Xuzhou, and Hou'erbao, as well as Xingzhuang and Shigang to its west. After a night of fierce fighting, the National Army's air force and artillery cooperated in a joint attack and annihilated all of them by this morning. It is estimated that the troops annihilated near Pantang Town were one division of Chen's Eighth Column, and the troops annihilated in the Hou'erbao area were two regiments of the 9th Division of Chen's Third Column (the other regiment was also annihilated there two days ago). In addition, a certain unit of the National Army launched a surprise attack on the bandits in Fengxian on the 16th under the moonlight, killing more than 4,000 bandits, capturing more than 1,000, and seizing hundreds of long and short guns and eight mortars.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper Xuzhou Dispatch, 17th] The Qiu and Sun Corps of the National Army advancing south, and the Hu Lian Corps advancing north from northern Anhui, have completed the encirclement of the bandits fleeing northwest towards Suxian.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper Bengbu Dispatch, 17th] Approximately 30,000 bandits entrenched in Suxian. Zhang Jiwu, the deputy commander of the Jinpu southern section of the railway protection, who defended the city for four days and nights, is missing. Zhang and his troops may have died in their duty. Powerful forces advancing from Guzhen have passed Renqiao and may reach Longwangmiao tonight, taking Suxian directly with the main forces on the left and right wings. The bandits are showing signs of wavering. (Another telegram) Most of the traffic police have retreated from the front lines to Bengbu, with wounded soldiers among them. The railway protection unit has taken them in, and the community is launching a campaign to comfort the troops.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper Xuzhou Dispatch, 17th] After being defeated by the National Army on the eastern front, the remnants of the 1st, 3rd, and 10th Columns of the bandits crossed the Bulao River and fled north yesterday. Because the National Army tracked and pursued them, the remnants of the bandits turned around and fled west towards Yaolou, Yian Mountain, and Mao Yinzhai (all located 12 kilometers southwest of Xuzhou). The National Army shelled the bandits overnight last night. This morning, the National Army's mechanized units continued to pursue the remnants. Large formations of the air force continued to extensively bomb the Bulao River and the crossings along the Grand Canal, cutting off the bandits' escape route north.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency Xuzhou Dispatch, 17th] A certain unit of the Li Corps successively captured Chenjialou, Zhengji, Taipingzhuang, and other strongholds northwest of Daxujia on the eastern flank today. After being surrounded, a bandit regiment in Taipingzhuang repeatedly attempted to escape but was ultimately annihilated with the coordination of tanks. In Zhengji, 11 light and heavy machine guns and 3 rocket launchers were seized. The loot in Taipingzhuang and Chenjialou was more than ten times that amount.</p>
<p>[Another telegram] The Suppression Headquarters announced: The bandits on the eastern flank of Xuzhou are under the control of our Qiu, Huang, and Li Corps and have no way to escape the battle. In order to avoid being completely annihilated by us, the bandits have no choice but to continue to fight like cornered beasts. The bandits fleeing south of Xuzhou, fearing being cut off along the way by our forces, are also making a last-ditch effort to counterattack us, attempting to contain the pressure on our eastern flank in order to cover their escape. In addition to our southern front forces dealing a head-on blow to the counterattacking bandits and scoring many victories, our eastern flank main forces are continuing to fiercely attack the bandits in their face, striving to annihilate the main force of the bandits in order to achieve a permanent solution.</p>
<h3 id="e2">Xuzhou City is Extremely Quiet; Foreign Reporters Report No War Fires Within Twenty Miles <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>[Gao Erya, Director of the United Press China Branch, Xuzhou Dispatch, 17th] This important military town in northern Jiangsu was extremely quiet on the 17th, as if it were hundreds of miles away from the battlefield, and unlike a city whose fate is attracting worldwide attention and is enough to determine the overall situation of the war. There is no war fire within twenty miles around Xuzhou. The reporter came to Xuzhou by civil aviation plane on the 17th. No fierce fighting between the two armies was seen along the way, nor was there any troop movement. The residents of Xuzhou City are as quiet as ever and not panicked at all. The north and south airports are no different from Shanghai's Longhua Airport. However, the cruel reality is that from a point 25 miles east of Xuzhou (near Nianzhuang) to a battle line 50 miles east of Xuzhou at Xin'anzhen, and within 20 miles of Xuzhou City, there are only small-scale sporadic artillery battles. Only six villages were seen on fire along the way. The reporter witnessed twelve tanks shelling two villages in a fan shape. One was already on fire, and the other had not been damaged due to inaccurate shooting. The reporter also witnessed a Chinese Air Force bomber flying low and bombing the communist artillery positions. The plane flew back and forth between Bengbu and Xuzhou, but saw overturned rails, crisscrossed sleepers, and locomotives lying everywhere. Chinese Flying General Tang Jun told the reporter: "The situation around Xuzhou has become calm in the past two days, and the situation has improved. As far as the current situation is concerned, this place is not threatened."</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper Xi'an Dispatch, 17th] The great battle in eastern Shaanxi has started again. The defeated remnants of Peng's bandits' 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, and 6th Columns, and the newly transferred 8th Column from southern Shanxi, attacked the triangular area between the Luo River and the Yellow River again in order to coordinate with the offensives in eastern China and central Shanxi. On the 15th, the bandits first attacked south with two columns. By night, they poured in with a crowd of 100,000, fiercely fighting along the line from Liangshicheng and Ruluoshan southwest of Hanyang to Qincheng Pass and Chengcheng. The military announced that more than 10,000 bandits had been killed or wounded as of last night, and the Xi'an Air Force also went all out to assist in the battle.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper Xi'an Dispatch, 17th] The great battle in eastern Shaanxi was only a flash in the pan. Peng's main bandit forces have already retreated north in embarrassment towards the Huanglong Mountain area this morning, and the National Army is pursuing and suppressing them. From the 15th to the present, more than 12,000 bandits have been killed or wounded.</p>

Only around Heguomu west of Gui Sui and Baitahu near the east of Gui Sui, there are more than 1000 of remnant bandits. The remnant bandits in Baotou are less than 1000 people. Yesterday, the National Army south of Xinghe in eastern Sui annihilated more than 400 bandits.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper Gui Sui Dispatch, 17th] The news of the great victory in Xuzhou has greatly boosted morale here. On the same day, the defending troops launched an attack against the bandits outside the city in coordination with the land and air forces, dealing a devastating blow to the bandits in Yijian Village and Daixun Yingzi north of the city. Another unit of the National Army recovered many strongholds along the Dahei River.</p>

<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 16th] Truman, while entertaining reporters in Key West, Florida, on the 16th, briefly discussed the situation in our country. Truman stated that the United States' policy toward China remains largely unchanged. When asked if he planned to take any new actions against the Communist threat, Truman replied that he and President Chiang were currently exchanging views through correspondence. Truman did not disclose the subjects discussed in his correspondence with President Chiang. When asked if he planned to provide any emergency aid to China, he simply replied that he was executing an act of Congress. Truman explained that of the $125 million in military aid to China approved by Congress, $112 million had already been disbursed, and the remaining amount would be paid out as soon as possible.</p>
<p>[US Information Service, Key West, Florida, 16th] At today's press conference, President Truman was asked what kind of emergency aid the United States could provide to China. President Truman stated that he was executing the orders of the 80th Congress, which had approved $125 million for China. This money could be used for military purposes. He said that of this amount, the Chinese government had already spent $112 million, and that the most effective use of the remainder was being studied. He also stated that no new emergency aid could be given before the 81st Congress convened in January. He firmly stated that no special session of the 80th Congress would be called. President Truman stated that the US government is maintaining contact with President Chiang.</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 16th] It was widely rumored on the evening of the 16th that Chinese Ambassador Wellington Koo, when meeting with Acting Secretary of State Robert Lovett, had requested him to forward a personal letter from President Chiang to President Truman, appealing for emergency aid to China. When asked if this was true, Wellington Koo replied, "No comment."</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Washington, 16th] President Truman and Secretary of State Marshall have agreed to review the global situation here on the 22nd, during which the situation in China and possible responses will be a major topic. Any action the Truman administration takes, beyond issuing a statement of support for China and accelerating aid plans, will likely be presented to Congress in the form of recommendations.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Washington, 17th] Diplomatic authorities here speculate that President Truman and the State Department are considering President Chiang's call for a reaffirmation of the US policy of aiding the Chinese government to boost morale and public spirit. Undersecretary of State Robert Lovett will hold a press conference at 5:00 PM (standard time) on the afternoon of the 17th, but it is not certain beforehand whether a statement on the situation in China will be made at that time. Sources with inside information say that the unveiling of major US policies is more likely after the President meets with Secretary of State Marshall at the White House on the 22nd. China is currently requesting the US government to provide an additional $1 billion in aid, $600 million of which is for military and $400 million for economic purposes. China apparently hopes the US will accept the same commitment as to Greece by actively participating in the anti-Communist war, which Washington authorities are still hesitant about.</p>

<h3 id="e26">How to Implement the Import-Export Linkage System <a href="#e26" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c26" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">26</a></h3>
<p>According to Article 10 of the revised Gold Yuan Note Issuance Regulations, anyone holding Gold Yuan or Gold Yuan Notes may purchase foreign exchange in accordance with government regulations on foreign exchange management. The regulations on foreign exchange management, in the portion concerning import-export trade, should be formulated in accordance with the linkage system. According to this regulation, the import-export linkage problem, which has been debated for over two years, has finally reached a decisive resolution. What remains to be supplemented is how this system should be formulated, namely, the technical problem regarding implementation.</p>
<p>First, how to link: Should a combined linkage or an individual linkage be adopted? The so-called individual linkage means a rigid regulation that a certain export commodity must be exchanged for a certain import commodity. For example, in February of this year, the Full Economic Commission planned to exchange cotton cloth and silk fabrics for cotton, rice, hemp, and hemp products from Southeast Asia and India, and to exchange tung oil, hog bristles, and mineral ores for transportation equipment from the United States. We believe that this formalized method is absolutely unsuitable. Because the needs and competitive conditions of foreign markets vary greatly, and the power does not entirely rest with us. Furthermore, the production and sales of goods available for export in our country, whether raw materials or finished products, are not always constant and must be adjusted at any time to suit the situation. For example, the fluctuating sales of cotton cloth in recent years are a clear proof of this. Therefore, for the sake of flexible operation, it is better to adopt a general approach rather than tying one's hands and adding more restrictions.</p>
<p>Second, the scope should be limited to the Yangtze River Road. Should the linkage be comprehensive or partial? Currently, import-export trade is still under strict management. It seems that goods permitted for import and export should not be restricted to linkage. As for certain goods that are not allowed to be imported or exported, or should be restricted from import or export, it is not difficult to clearly stipulate in the above-mentioned management regulations, and it is also unrelated to the scope of linkage. The main points that should be limited are (1) the amount of imports and exports must be offset, and exports should not exceed imports to prevent the outflow of gold and (2) within a certain period, the total amount of imports of various goods may be adjusted to avoid uneven damage.</p>
<p>Third, should the foreign exchange obtained from exports be allowed to be transferred? Those who advocate not allowing transfer are concerned about avoiding the emergence of black markets and avoiding stimulating prices, and their intentions are certainly understandable. However, they may not know that there are too many reasons for price fluctuations, not limited to the black market foreign exchange. Furthermore, black market foreign exchange has never been completely eradicated before the restoration of the free foreign exchange market. There is no need to reject food because of choking and uniformly prohibit its transfer. Moreover, import and export businesses each have their own specialties, and it is impossible to force them to operate concurrently. Even for those who originally operate concurrently, the goods they import are not necessarily what they themselves need. Therefore, the foreign exchange obtained by exporters, in addition to their own concurrent import business, should be allowed to be freely transferred without any restrictions. Moreover, the foreign exchange received, in addition to the requirement to import at least the equivalent amount of permitted goods within a specified period, should not be subject to other conditions. Because the sole purpose of the linkage system is to exchange goods internationally to alleviate the shortage of foreign exchange. As long as an equal amount of imported goods is used to replenish exported goods, the goal is achieved, and it does not originally require that the importer must be the original exporter. In other words, the goal of compensation is in goods, not in people. If human intervention is mixed in, many troubles and malpractices will be added out of thin air, and the result will greatly weaken the function of linkage.</p>
<p>Fourth, should there be a specified time limit for linkage? This is a very important issue and also a rather difficult one, because if the import deadline is not specified in advance, exporters may take the opportunity to use materials as an attempt to evade capital. On the other hand, if the deadline is set too short or too strict, it may also shackle exports and cause many inconveniences. This is very clear: overseas market prices, locks, competition, or other temporary changes are not easily predicted by exporters. There are many examples of this, and the durability and seasonality of various goods also vary. In addition, due to the shortage of materials after the war and frequent labor strikes, various orders are often delayed for a long time and cannot be delivered within a short period of time. Therefore, when implementing linkage, how to stipulate a reasonable deadline so that this linkage procedure can be fully completed is indeed not an easy task. Some people advocate handling exports first and then imports; others advocate completing the import application procedures at the same time as exporting. This is just a kind of prevention against the evasion of export foreign exchange and prohibited imports.</p>
<p>Fifth, how to take into account the government's need for foreign exchange? It is feared that the foreign exchange from exports will be completely taken by importers, and the government will not be able to cope with its huge expenditures. In fact, private individuals can operate export businesses, and public institutions can also operate them concurrently. In the past, the Central Trust Bureau and other institutions handled barter trade and export sales, and the quantity was not small. However, whether the goods exported by the government and the foreign exchange it obtains should be subject to the linkage system is, of course, another question. Moreover, the remittance portion of overseas Chinese, the transfer portion of foreign currency, and possible loans are not within the scope of import and export linkage. However, with the implementation of linkage, imports and exports offset each other, and the government no longer needs to bear this huge import expenditure. Therefore, it seems that there is not much problem with the government's required foreign exchange position. Some people believe that (1) the foreign exchange obtained by exporters, in addition to handling imports themselves, should still be settled with the Central Bank if there is a surplus; (2) the government may as well extract one or two tenths from each export foreign exchange for public use. This also seems to be superfluous.</p>
<p>We have always consistently advocated this linkage system, believing that it is an effective way to promote export and increase import. However, we only regard it as one of the effective methods, and other methods should still be promoted separately from various aspects to expand international trade. Because the decline of the countryside, the obstruction of transportation, and the various goods available for export have already declined year by year to a very fragmented point. As a result of soaring prices, it often forms an inverted situation with overseas market prices. In addition, the original foreign markets have been repeatedly seized, and it is not easy to recover and pass on. Therefore, if we have excessive expectations after implementing import and export linkage, thinking that this method alone can immediately and completely restore the export business, I am afraid that we are viewing the problem too simply. The details of how to implement the linkage system are currently being drafted. We hope that these detailed rules must take into account the facts and avoid creating complications to avoid losing the original intention. At the same time, the competent authorities should still take a positive attitude and earnestly promote various methods related to promoting exports to supplement the deficiencies of the linkage system.</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper, Zhenjiang, 17th] After the news of the great victory in Xuzhou, the people of the provincial capital were encouraged, and prices fell across the board.

Citizens were all rejoicing.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Changsha, 17th] In the midst of falling prices of various commodities, the market has changed from a buying spree to a selling spree.

<p>[Central News Agency, Fuzhou, 17th] Under the phenomenon of high prices and tight credit, several important commercial firms have recently gone bankrupt in the wholesale distribution centers of Shanghang Road and Xiahang Road in Fuzhou. Each firm has debts of more than 300,000 Gold Yuan, all due to poor cash flow. The bankruptcy of these commercial firms shocked the entire market, causing general speculators to lose color. Since the start of the resource buying spree, they have absorbed large quantities of goods at any interest rate to engage in hoarding and seek huge profits, eventually destroying the government's price limit line and making the lives of most people even more difficult. As a result of their raising prices, credit has become tight, causing those with weaker turnover capacity to have to declare bankruptcy. On the other hand, floating capital continues to concentrate in Shanghai, and the Shanghai exchange premium is even higher than before the August 19 currency reform. This extraordinary economic situation is rare in the past.</p>

<h3 id="e55">The Three Powers Refuse to Negotiate with the Soviet Union Before the Berlin Blockade is Completely Lifted; Formally Reply to the Appeal of Evatt and Lie; The Berlin Dispute is Still Handled by the Security Council <a href="#e55" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c55" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">55</a></h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] Paris, 17th Radio: Evatt Lie issued a joint statement, again urging the four powers to quickly resolve the Berlin crisis. This statement was issued hours after the Western powers rejected the proposal to resume four-power talks.</p>
<p>[United Press, Paris, 17th Dispatch] The United States, Britain, and France today formally replied to the peace appeal of UN General Assembly President Evatt and Secretary-General Lie, accusing the Soviet Union of hindering the resolution of the four-power dispute and advocating that the Berlin issue continue to be handled by the Security Council. The US reply reiterated that it is unwilling to negotiate the Berlin issue under the threat of a Soviet blockade. Once the blockade is lifted, it will be prepared to negotiate with it. The British reply stated that the Soviet Union's rejection of the mediation proposal of the six neutral countries has hindered the resolution of the Berlin issue. The US reply was signed by Secretary of State Marshall, stating that the United States had directly negotiated this matter with the Soviet Union until it became clear that the Soviet Union's blockade of Berlin was intended to achieve political goals, and the Soviet Union had no right to these goals. We therefore submitted this issue as a case of endangering peace to the Security Council for discussion, and it is still on the agenda of the meeting. The Berlin dispute involves the basic principles of the United Nations Charter, that is, whether the Soviet government may use force, whether it is a blockade or economic pressure, to deprive Western countries of their right to participate in the administration of Berlin. Evatt and Lie did not express their opinions when they received the replies from the three countries. According to well-informed sources, the two will continue to mediate despite being rebuffed. The US reply also stated that in addition to preparing to participate in the Security Council to resolve the Berlin issue, the United States also intends to participate in any efforts to address the fundamental disputes involved in this issue, so that the threat to peace can be lifted and all parties concerned can sincerely accept it.</p>
<h3 id="e56">President Truman States That the US Stance on the Berlin Issue Remains Unchanged and Is Willing to Meet Stalin in Washington <a href="#e56" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c56" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">56</a></h3>
<p>[US Information Service, Key West, Florida, 16th Dispatch] President Truman told reporters today that the US stance on the Berlin issue has not changed. The United States will not negotiate with the Soviet Union on the Berlin or the entire German issue until the Soviet Union lifts the land blockade of Berlin. Truman said that he will review the overall international situation on November 22 (the day after returning to Washington) and will meet with Secretary of State Marshall and Economic Cooperation Administration European Inspector Harriman. Harriman returned to Washington today and will conduct consultations with all parties for two weeks. The President said that he has learned of the proposal of Evatt Lie. Marshall has drafted a reply, which has been approved by himself.</p>
<p>When reporters asked about the rumor that Marshall was about to resign, the President said that he would discuss this matter when he met with Marshall. Marshall had intended to retire after resigning as Chief of Staff. His appointment as Secretary of State was driven by patriotism. Answering other questions, Truman said that he had no plans to send a special envoy to the Soviet Union, and his wife did not intend to go to the Soviet Union to meet with Stalin, but he was eager to meet with the Soviet leader in Washington at any time. At the same time, Soviet Representative Vyshinsky has submitted a reply to the proposal of Evatt Lie, reiterating the position of the Soviet Union in its note to the West on October 3. Vyshinsky said that the Soviet Union agreed with Evatt Lie's view that "the resolution of the Berlin issue will affect the resolution of other issues, such as the treaties on Germany, Austria, and Japan." The Soviet government "also believes that personal contact and mutual trust among the leaders of various countries are essential to improving international relations." Observers pointed out that Evatt Lie's proposal did not mention a meeting of the leaders of various countries. Vyshinsky raised the issue of the entire Germany, while Evatt Lie's proposal did not touch on the entire Germany, but only advocated resolving the Berlin issue.</p>

<p>[United Press, Berlin, 16th Dispatch] Well-informed sources at the Allied Headquarters stated on the 16th that 300,000 Soviet troops are preparing for the first post-war army winter exercise in East Germany.

<p>[United Press, Paris, 17th Dispatch] Nine days after General de Gaulle's French People's Alliance won a victory in the Senate elections, de Gaulle received reporters at the Alliance headquarters on the 17th and suggested organizing a new global strategic system in which France would be responsible for Europe and North Africa, the United States would be responsible for the Far East and the Pacific, and Britain would be in charge of the Middle East and East Africa. De Gaulle also called for elections to the National Assembly, saying that France would collapse completely politically and economically if it did not overthrow its centrist coalition government.</p>
<p>The National Assembly is the lower house of France and has great legislative power. So far, the French People's Alliance has not gained a seat. De Gaulle hinted that he might dissolve or ban the Communist Party once he takes office. He advocated abolishing the Western European Union and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, and replacing them with a global strategic bureau composed of the US President, the British Prime Minister, the French Head of Government, and senior military advisors from the three countries.</p>

<p>The Cominform is Indeed Providing Substantial Aid to the French Communist Party</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 16th] French Interior Minister Moch on the 10th formally accused the Soviet Union and its satellite states of inciting and financially supporting the labor unrest in France, deliberately undermining the Marshall Plan. Moch told the Parliament that he had documents proving that the Communist Information Bureau (Cominform) had guaranteed the French Communist Party substantial aid to prevent the strikes from ending prematurely. After the Secretary of the General Confederation of Labor (CGT), controlled by the French Communist Party, appealed to Zhdanov, the chief Soviet representative of the Cominform, the aforementioned guarantee was obtained. Zhdanov had passed away two months prior. Moch continued, stating that émigrés from many Eastern European countries had been secretly funneling large sums of money to France to assist the strikes, and the Cominform had agreed to provide 459,000 francs for inciting the strikes.</p>

<p>Coal Production Losses are Incalculable</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Tokyo, 17th] Fifty-eight thousand coal miners today held their eighth day of rotating strikes. The first round of rotating strikes is scheduled to end today, and the second round of rotating strikes will begin on November 23 if labor and management fail to reach an agreement. Japanese coal production will suffer losses due to this strike, but the exact figures for these losses, except for the Yamaguchi district in southern Kyushu, are currently impossible to calculate. In the Yamaguchi district, the total amount of coal lost due to the coal miners' strike has reached over 6,000 tons.</p>
<p>[New Asia News Agency, Tokyo, 17th] The All-Japan Coal Mine Workers' Union, the Japan Coal Miners' Union, and the Japan Coal Mining Association, three labor unions, held a joint struggle committee on the 16th to discuss concrete measures for the second phase of the strike.

<h3 id="e73">Execution by Hanging for Seven War Criminals, Including Tojo, to be Advanced; MacArthur to Make Final Decision Next Monday <a href="#e73" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c73" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">73</a></h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Tokyo, 17th] Well-informed sources stated on the 17th that MacArthur and Allied officers will meet on the 22nd to discuss the sentences of Japanese war criminals. Tojo and the other six Japanese war criminals sentenced to hanging will be executed within the next five or six days. However, no official announcement has been made to date. Allied officers and Eighth Army officers are tight-lipped about the execution of the hangings and how the bodies will be handled. It is generally believed that the execution of the Japanese war criminals is imminent, and there is evidence to support this view.</p>
<p>MacArthur only allowed the defendants' lawyers eight days, from November 12th to 19th, to file appeals. Well-informed sources stated that the reason for the swift execution of the hangings is to prevent the defendants' lawyers from turning the entire event into a legal dispute and delaying it. The defendants' lawyers are attempting to appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court, the United Nations, and other institutions. Officials, prosecutors, and the general public here at the Far East International Military Tribunal believe that the appeal is unlikely to succeed, and the final decision rests with MacArthur. Based on past experience here, it is generally believed that the hangings will be carried out by Eighth Army officers in Sugamo Prison. Whether reporters will be allowed to visit the execution site is still uncertain. Observers say that unless reporters are allowed to attend, rumors that Japanese war criminals have not been hanged will likely arise frequently. Such rumors emerged after Japanese war criminals in the Philippines were secretly executed.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Tokyo, 17th] Former Japanese Prime Minister Hirota Koki, one of the Japanese war criminals sentenced to hanging by the Far East International Military Tribunal, has reportedly had his son hire a lawyer to prevent anyone from petitioning MacArthur for commutation of his sentence.</p>

According to the original verdict, Tojo, Doihara, Itagaki, Matsui, and four others were sentenced to death, sixteen were sentenced to life imprisonment, and two were sentenced to fixed-term imprisonment. In the review of the verdict, MacArthur only has the power to reduce sentences and not to increase them. The Chinese side believes that the verdict is very fair and there is no need for revision.</p>

He also stated that the government is not considering the opinions expressed against the letter by the Far Eastern Commission, which clearly refers to the Soviet Union's firm opposition to the Allied Headquarters' measures. Yoshida also urged the Parliament to quickly pass the revision of the Civil Service Law with tactics to accelerate the dissolution of the Japanese Parliament, which is considered by all to be an acceleration tactic. He also emphasized that for the Japanese government, the Allied Headquarters' letter should be considered first.</p>

<p>[Our Dispatch] The government has temporarily borrowed 9,800 tons of rice from Hong Kong, with Jardine Matheson &amp; Co. handling the loading of 5,000 tons and Taikoo &amp; Co. handling 4,800 tons. The first ship, Jardine Matheson's "Zexheng" (澤生) , carrying 1,700 tons, arrived in port yesterday afternoon and berthed at the Gonghexiang (公和祥) Wharf for unloading.</p>
<p>[Our Dispatch] The city's Food Conference was held at the City Hall Conference Room yesterday afternoon at 4:00 PM, presided over by Mayor Wu, with the attendance of more than ten representatives from relevant agencies. It is reported that Jardine Matheson's "Zexheng" (澤生) has already arrived in Shanghai, carrying 1,600 tons of rice from Hong Kong. In addition, the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's "Zhongxing" (中興) has also arrived in Shanghai, carrying 500 tons of rice from Taiwan. Goods can be picked up starting today. Technical issues related to unloading were discussed during the meeting. It was also learned that the city's October rice ration will be completely distributed by the 25th of this month. The November rice ration is scheduled to begin distribution on December 5th.</p>
<p>The city's food supply has gradually improved due to a slight improvement in the situation of transportation obstructions in various regions in recent days, and the most severe period has passed. Most of the October rice ration has already arrived, and the remaining approximately 30,000 dan (石) are expected to arrive before the 20th. The Food Emergency Procurement and Storage Committee will soon begin planning for the November rice ration. It is reported that the city's rice ration has been seized by local authorities in various regions. Among them, the larger amounts include 10,000 dan (石) in Zhejiang Province. The original agreement was to exchange the rice for fertilizer, and the fertilizer had already been delivered to and received by the Zhejiang Provincial Government. However, the Zhejiang Provincial Government insisted on "deducting" 5,000 dan (石) to have the "819" price limit repurchased by the Zhejiang Provincial Government, resulting in a stalemate. In addition, of the 50,000 dan (石) supplied to Shanghai by Jiangxi Province, only over 6,000 dan (石) have been approved for transportation to date. The relevant authorities are continuing to negotiate for the release of the above-mentioned seized rice.</p>
<p>[Our Dispatch] According to news from the City Government News Office, Wuxi deducts two dou (斗) per shi (石) of rice purchased by Shanghai merchants, and the Lujiaxiang (陸家浜) Security Team under Kunshan County detained more than 40 rice boats passing through the area. After learning of the above-mentioned situation, Mayor Wu immediately telegraphed Jiangsu Provincial Government Chairman Ding Chizhi (丁治醫) yesterday morning, requesting immediate rectification.</p>

<h3 id="e82">Director of the Social Affairs Bureau Explains High and Low Labor-Capital Dispute Indices in Detail, Hoping for Cooperation to Eliminate Disputes <a href="#e82" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c82" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">82</a></h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] The City Government has announced that the employee living index for the first half of this month is 8.1 times. Many employers believe that the multiple is too high and they cannot afford it, but some employees still believe it is too low and express doubts about the method of compiling this living index. Director Wu of the Social Affairs Bureau made a special statement yesterday, saying that the index was based on on-site investigations and was jointly reviewed and approved before publication. Although the representatives of the General Labor Union repeatedly questioned it at the time, they expressed understanding after the attendees explained it. However, since the opening of price limits on the 1st of this month, the market fluctuations have been more extraordinary than usual, and because the supply of some goods during this period was insufficient, the owners arbitrarily bargained for prices without standards, which inevitably gave people a deep impression. In fact, however, it is often a matter of having a price but no market, and not all of them are actual transactions. These virtual bids cannot be used as the basis for statistics. As for the dates of the price surveys for various items in the living index, they are routinely Tuesdays and Fridays. The City Government Statistics Office sends personnel to conduct on-site surveys. Among them, vegetables, rice, and noodles are actually purchased to use the purchase price as the price for the day, which is indeed reliable and well-founded, and different from the virtual bids that arbitrarily bargained for prices. Director Wu also said that although the investigation and compilation of this index are conducted by the City Government Statistics Office, he also sent personnel to participate in the investigation in order to be thorough in preparation for this highly abnormal situation on the market. The staff members have badges for easy identification, and it is also a fact that the owners may be more cautious and dare not raise prices excessively when bargaining. Director Wu said that in the past, during the extremely severe rice shortage, rice prices had jumped wildly, and citizens felt a great threat, but factories often borrowed and issued rice to employees or allocated in-kind items to help regulate them. In addition, workers largely pre-paid one month's wages in November and were allowed to temporarily not deduct them, which helped workers' lives to some extent. During this period of price adjustment, the results of the index compilation will inevitably differ from person to person and it is difficult to fully meet the ideals of all parties. Director Wu sincerely hopes that labor and management will continue to earnestly refer to the spirit of cooperation in the past to eliminate disputes.</p>
<h3 id="e83">Director of the Social Affairs Bureau Explains Various Salary Issues <a href="#e83" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c83" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">83</a></h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] Since the wage system in various industries in the city has been restored to the living index-based salary calculation method, some factories have calculated wages according to the previous period or the previous month's index, and there is no index for October. There are some misunderstandings between labor and management about how to calculate, whether to use the gold yuan obtained on August 19 as the base, whether the discounts stipulated by the government in the past should continue to be implemented, and the date of wage payment. Wu Kaixian, Chairman of the Labor-Capital Assessment Committee of the city, specially issued the following explanation yesterday: (1) The base salary of wages in various industries should be based on the gold yuan obtained after the currency reform and calculated according to the employee living index announced by the City Government (that is, one gold yuan in the past salary is 8.1 gold yuan in the previous period of wages in November). (2) If the wages have been calculated according to the previous period's index in the past, the wages for the first half of November will be settled according to the current period's index because there is no index for the previous period. In the future, it will be handled according to the original habit. (3) The base salary will no longer be discounted if the wages have been converted into gold yuan according to the government's regulations. As for the employers, if the business or production is not good and the wages cannot be borne, those who have agreed with the labor and management to formulate a separate discount method will still follow their agreement. (4) The date of wage payment is still handled in accordance with the regulations of the Wage Payment Guidelines for Factories in Various Industries decided by the Labor-Capital Assessment Committee (that is, each factory will set its own fixed payment period within seven days after the index is announced).</p>

<h3 id="e93">Bribery Case of Fuel Management Committee Officials; Fifth Trial Concludes with Closing Arguments; Manager of Suzhou Electric Company Testifies, Describing Invitations to Banquets and Delivery of Funds <a href="#e93" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c93" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">93</a></h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The District Court judges Shen Tianbao (Presiding Judge), Xie Zhiying, and Shao Renjie continued the trial of the Fuel Management Committee officials accused of bribery yesterday. The defendants Yang Yunfu, Zou Jidao, Zhao Bojun, Mao Meixuan, Sun Jice, Lin Kezhen, Miao Shouzi, Dai Weihua, Xu Baoguang, Ren Hui, Han Chengpu, and Sun Zhigang were brought to court, along with Sun Zhigang, and the trial concluded with closing arguments from morning until evening. The verdict is scheduled to be announced at 9:00 AM on the 24th of this month.</p>
<p>Yesterday was the fifth trial session of this case. At the request of the defendants, including Sun Jice, the manager of the Suzhou Electric Company, Zhang Bintong, was summoned to testify. According to Zhang's testimony, the company needed 3,000 to 3,500 tons of coal per month. In order to facilitate the allocation of coal, they hosted Director Sun and others at the Xinghualou and International Hotel in the city twice at the end of last year and the beginning of this year. This spring, Sun Jice's family traveled to Suzhou, where they were hosted at a banquet and given various local products before their departure.</p>
<p>Equivalent to the Price of 100 Dan of Rice</p>
<p>Zhang further stated that at the end of 1947, Director Sun sent someone to Suzhou to borrow 100 dan of rice. At that time, Zhang declined due to the company's financial difficulties and the approaching New Year. However, in January and February of this year, the Fuel Management Committee reduced the coal allocation, citing the unavailability of the Beining Road and requiring the company to go to Beijing to collect coal. Because the company urgently needed coal, they reluctantly sent Director Sun a New China Bank cashier's check for 100 million yuan (equivalent to the price of 100 dan of rice at the time) during the Lunar New Year. In March, the coal allocation was restored to the original amount. On September 22 of this year, Director Sun claimed that a friend needed 1,000 gold yuan, and the company immediately sent someone to deliver the money. When questioned about this, Sun repeatedly claimed that it was exchanged for a watch, but Zhang denied this in court. Sun then stammered, saying, "The money was sent by Manager Zhang voluntarily." Lin Keying was then questioned about Zhang Shitong's offering banquets and sending money. Lin denied receiving money but admitted to being invited to the International Hotel and receiving local products. After examining the other defendants, the closing arguments began.</p>
<p>Providing Reporting Opinions</p>
<p>Le Zhuangxin, Section Chief of the Municipal Government's Investigation Division, first provided several reporting opinions from the perspective of handling the case: (1) This case is a官商勾結 [collusion between officials and merchants] bribery case. The main task of the Fuel Management Committee is to control fuel and regulate supply and demand. The law is well-intentioned, but those who implement it take the opportunity to enrich themselves, which greatly affects legitimate coal merchants and creates black market coal. (2) The defendants Dai Weihua, Xu Baoguang, Ren Hui, etc., worked diligently in the committee and did not handle external affairs. Although they received bribes, they did not know what they were receiving, so their criminal behavior is relatively minor. (3) In Mao Meixuan's case, he handled the procurement certificates for 500 tons of coal, which included a 2% commission. Mao did not know this, so if Mao is at fault, it is for handling the procurement certificates. (4) Sun Zhigang, as the general affairs officer of the Jiangzhe Shipping Company, was only acting on orders to deliver the bribe.</p>
<p>The Evidence of Bribery is Conclusive</p>
<p>(5) Han Gupu was entrusted to sell coal for various shipping companies, which is a commercial activity, and he did not purchase the coal himself, so it does not constitute bribery. (6) Regarding the five defendants Yang Yunfu, Sun Jice, Zhao Bojun, Lin Keying, and Zou Jidao, the evidence of bribery is conclusive, and they should be dealt with according to the law. The court adjourned at noon and resumed at 1:00 PM in the afternoon. Prosecutor Zheng Yanjun stood up and stated the prosecution's intentions. The defendants' defense lawyers, including Pan Zhenya, then presented their arguments in turn. The court finally questioned each of the defendants individually and scheduled the verdict to be announced on the 24th. Yang Yunfu and the other eleven defendants were remanded in custody, and Sun Zhigang was ordered to return.</p>

<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Due to the adjusted allocation price of fuel, various public utility companies in the city have submitted requests to the municipal government to be allowed to automatically adjust prices according to costs, as they feel increasingly unable to bear the burden after the release of the cost-of-living index multiplier for the first half of this month. It is reported that the Municipal Public Utilities Bureau has agreed in principle and has sent personnel to Beijing last night to request instructions from the Executive Yuan, and they are expected to return to Shanghai tomorrow.

<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The China National Aviation Corporation's planned Sino-Japanese air route was rumored to be opening at the end of last month, but it has not yet materialized. It has been learned that this plan has been decided to be temporarily shelved because the main purpose of opening the air route was to attract US military personnel stationed in Japan to travel to China. However, with the current war situation in the country, the United States is busy evacuating its citizens, and American personnel in Tokyo are unlikely to be interested in traveling to China at this time. Therefore, the opening of the Sino-Japanese air route would be meaningless, and the China National Aviation Corporation has decided to shelve it.</p>

<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The Private Primary and Secondary School Federation held a meeting of directors and supervisors yesterday afternoon at the Municipal Education Association to discuss the issue of increasing tuition and fees. Representatives from the faculty also attended. The faculty members spoke enthusiastically, believing that the Legislative Yuan has already approved adjustments to the salaries of public school teachers, which is vastly different from private schools. Therefore, the faculty demanded a surcharge exceeding four times the original amount. Director Li attended the meeting to advise them. The meeting ultimately decided that the surcharge should not exceed four times the original amount in principle, and the name of the fee would be determined by each school.</p>
<p>According to Director Li's statement to reporters, he does not agree with the four-fold increase in tuition and fees. The method of subsidizing the faculty's hardship should be discussed jointly by the school, student parents, and faculty members. Donations should be made voluntarily based on the parents' financial ability, and the amount cannot be rigidly stipulated.</p>

<h3 id="e101">Zheng Jie Issues Statement on Scholarship Issues <a href="#e101" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c101" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">101</a></h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The presidents of various public and private universities and colleges in the city criticized the Municipal Department's Hang Vice-Minister at a meeting the day before yesterday for the delayed issuance of unified scholarships for this semester. The presidents of various private universities and colleges also decided to waive the scholarships. Zheng Jie, the secretary-general of the Shanghai Municipal Scholarship Unified Review Committee, issued the following statement yesterday: (1) The reason for the relatively late issuance of scholarships this semester is that the schools failed to submit application forms or lists of tuition-free students to the committee on time. For example, the application form from Daxia University has not yet been submitted, and the application form from Hujiang University has not been returned to the committee after being retrieved for re-examination. As for primary and secondary schools, many schools, including the attached high school of the Law School, have not yet submitted the list of tuition-free students, which has greatly affected the review work of the committee. (2) Chairman Pan Gongzhan and Vice-Chairman Li Ximou have always advocated that scholarship issuance procedures should be handled quickly. Therefore, despite their busy schedules with other official duties, they promptly reviewed the committee's official documents. As for myself and the four staff members of the committee, we have done our best to expedite the committee's affairs and do not believe there have been any delays on our part. (3) Although this semester's scholarships were individually donated by various groups at the International Hotel on August 27, all donations could not be collected immediately. As of now, some groups have not yet sent their donations. As for the safekeeping of scholarships, except for those kept by the donating groups themselves, the remaining funds are immediately deposited into the Municipal Bank upon receipt by the committee. Moreover, the committee's withdrawal procedures from the Municipal Bank require the seals of Vice-Chairman Li and myself. Chairman Pan does not manage the committee's donation receipts and expenditures. Furthermore, the committee's mission is to fulfill its responsibility to needy students at all levels of public and private schools, and even bank interest is allocated to scholarships. However, the current devaluation of the gold yuan was unexpected. (4) This semester's scholarships for needy students in public and private colleges and universities have been separately sent by the committee to the schools for distribution, and many schools, including the Lixin Accounting College, have already received the funds. In order to ensure that the scholarship distribution procedures of the committee and the donating groups are cautious, they are slightly stricter, which we hope will be understood by the schools.</p>

<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] At around 9:00 PM on the 8th, during the city-wide household registration check, Xu Dezhong, a patrol officer of the Criminal Division of the Songshan Road Police Station, led police officers Chen Fusheng, Liu Dengdi, Hao Wende, volunteer criminal police Fei Leimeng, Xu Yushi, Lu Huinu, etc., to conduct a check in the Dakang Lane on Jianguo East Road. They saw five people lingering in the alley, attempting to avoid the check. They immediately blocked their path, questioned them, and found their actions suspicious. They were taken to the police station for interrogation and it was discovered that they were indeed violent robbers. They confessed their names as Gao Zheng, Huang Shaoxiang, Chen Boqing, Zhu Liang, and Yu Jinghai. Section Chief Shen Zuoluo ordered the handling police officer to go to the home of the criminal Gao in the Yaojiaqiao shantytown on Tongbei Road and seize a pistol, eight bullets, a pure gold ring, and 58 silver coins. Gao was interrogated again and confessed that the gold ring and silver coins were all stolen goods.

It is reported that the gang of robbers used the guise of conducting a household registration check for each robbery. The gang leader, Gao Zheng, had a large following in the Haimen area of northern Jiangsu, and they all called Gao "Big Brother," which showed potential influence. The police had long intended to arrest him, and he was finally captured unintentionally, which can be said to be a case of the mills of justice grinding slowly but surely. There are also three receivers of stolen goods: Gu Yutang of the Lu Tianbao Silver Shop on Xizang Road, Zhu Xiquan of the Xinbinfeng Silver Shop at 953 Jiaozhou Road, and Wu Junda, a pawnbroker at 1 Lane 881 Haining Road, who were also apprehended one after another, and part of the stolen goods were seized. The police are asking the owners to identify their stolen goods. The case has been fully investigated, and the criminals are scheduled to be transferred to the District Prosecutor's Office for investigation this morning.</p>

<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The ration cards for the city's industrial workers and their families have been printed by the Central Printing Factory, totaling 1.2 million copies. They will be distributed by the General Labor Union to the various labor unions starting today, and the actual goods can be distributed after the 20th.

<p>Each book of ration cards contains 25 coupons, including rice, oil, sugar, coal briquettes, and cloth coupons from November of this year to April of next year. Each person will receive one dou of rice per month, one jin of oil, half a jin of sugar, 50 jin of coal briquettes, and one zhang five chi of cloth every six months. According to Social Affairs Bureau Director Wu, the ration price is planned to be no more than half of the market price, pending a decision by the Municipal Government. The coal briquettes were originally made of both coal slag and pure coal dust. However, due to the sharp decline in the production of coal slag, it has been decided to manufacture them with pure coal dust, commonly known as atomic coal briquettes, which have a stronger fire. Therefore, the ration quantity has been reduced by half to 25 jin per person.</p>

<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The Soldiers' Dependents' Support Association held its 14th meeting at the Canhui yesterday, presided over by Pan Gongzhan. As a result of the discussion, three important matters were decided: (1) The surcharge levied on dance halls in the city for the dependents' support fund for soldiers, originally set at 100%, excluding donations, has been reduced to 60%, excluding donations, as the industry claims that the high surcharge rate is affecting business. (2) Restaurants and tea houses with dance floor equipment should levy a surcharge of 10% on their total income for the dependents' support fund for soldiers. (3) The original amount of 200 yuan per soldier for the dependents' support fund should be increased in principle due to rising prices. The amount of the increase and the source of the additional surcharge are to be discussed at the next meeting.</p>
<h3 id="e112">Morning Friends Cup Main Battle: Morning Friends Lead All the Way; H威力 Backslides and Suffers Defeat, Resulting in a Score of Sixty-Six to Fifty-One <a href="#e112" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c112" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">112</a></h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] In the Morning Friends Cup basketball game, the two giants, Morning Friends and H威力, met last night in a true battle of strength. Both teams had four wins in four games, and the outcome was crucial for their championship prospects. In a fierce forty-minute battle, Morning Friends displayed extremely skillful teamwork and effective shooting, ultimately defeating H威力 with a score of sixty-six to fifty-one. In the first half, Morning Friends also led by ten points, with a score of thirty-three to twenty-three. With this victory, Morning Friends has greatly increased its hopes for the championship. In the other two games last night, the Class A team, Swatow, defeated New Life with a score of sixty-one to forty-four, the first half ending twenty-five to sixteen. In the Class B game, Tie Lian defeated Tai Kang Hei, twenty-four to seventeen, the first half ending fifteen to six.</p>
<p>The Chinese Youth Basketball Hall was packed with over eight hundred fans last night, an unprecedented spectacle for the Chinese Youth. Morning Friends' victory was due to their familiarity with the court, their tacit cooperation, and their ample strength. Wang Boyuan gave a particularly outstanding performance, scoring twenty-four points alone. H威力's performance was greatly below par, their luck with the ball was poor, and they repeatedly missed shots. Their tactics encountered difficulties on the small court of the Chinese Youth and could not be effectively deployed. Moreover, their formation was chaotic, and they failed to contain Wang Boyuan, allowing Morning Friends to penetrate their defense with ease. If they can maintain their composure from now on, there may still be a glimmer of hope.</p>
<p>Morning Friends' Shooting: As if Divinely Assisted</p>
<p>H威力's starting lineup was: Wang, Cao, Tian, Zhang, Wei. Morning Friends' lineup was: He, Fu, Liang, and two Wangs. Wang Rong scored the first points with seven jump shots. H威力's Wang Yongfang made all his free throws. Morning Friends' Liang Xiong biao made two layups, giving Morning Friends an early lead and maintaining it throughout the game. H威力 repeatedly failed to score. At fourteen to eight, H威力 called a timeout. The situation gradually became more balanced, and H威力 chased the score, tying it at sixteen. The battle reached its climax, with both sides attacking at a high speed and putting on a very exciting show. However, Morning Friends' score began to rise again. Boyuan and Weibiao's shooting seemed divinely assisted. H威力 appeared slightly flustered. In the first half, Morning Friends led by ten points, thirty-three to twenty-three.</p>
<p>H威力's Counterattack: Ineffective</p>
<p>After the break, Morning Friends' momentum did not wane, and they continued to advance. At forty-six to thirty, the difference became increasingly large. H威力 substituted Shang Chongyue for Tian Fuhai and launched a desperate counterattack, but failed to alleviate the pressure from Morning Friends. At fifty-two to thirty-eight, Fu Qixia was fouled out for the fifth time and replaced by Sun Moses. H威力 also brought Zhang Pu and Tian Fuhai back in. The score began to narrow slightly, but Sun Moses scored on a steal, and they fell behind again. The final score was sixty-six to fifty-one, a difference of fifteen points.</p>

<h3 id="e115">Implementation Details Slightly Revised: Gold and Silver Exchange Begins on Monday; Gold and Silver Reserves Valued at 12 Billion; Finance Minister Xu Kan Arrives in Shanghai from Nanjing Yesterday <a href="#e115" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c115" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">115</a></h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] The implementation details for the exchange of gold and silver for deposits were taken to Nanjing for instructions by Liu Gongyun on the 16th. Liu has already returned to Shanghai yesterday. It is reported that there are still some revisions to the implementation details, but the date of commencement of the exchange has been decided as next Monday. Unless there are unexpected reasons, there will be no changes.</p>
<p>The person in charge of the Central Bank convened a meeting of the heads of the Bank of Communications, the Central Farmers Bank, and the China Development Bank at 3:00 PM the day before yesterday to discuss the exchange procedures for the substitute exchange banks. According to the Central Bank's current gold reserves of approximately 5 million taels and 100 million silver dollars, if all were exchanged, it could recover 12 billion gold yuan.</p>
<p>[Our Dispatch] Finance Minister Xu Kan flew to Shanghai from Nanjing at 3:00 PM yesterday afternoon. After arriving, he immediately held discussions with Yu Hongjun and Liu Gongyun, reportedly related to the exchange of gold and silver and the issue of increasing the capital of financial institutions. Xu is scheduled to host a reception for reporters at 5:00 PM this afternoon, where he will make a report.</p>
<p>[Our Dispatch] The import and export trade linkage measures were taken to the Executive Yuan in Nanjing by Shao Huihua, Deputy Director of the Business Bureau of the Central Bank, and others. They have returned to Shanghai after completing the process. The implementation issue is currently being discussed with the Transportation and Management Committee. It is expected that the full text of the measures will be announced today.</p>
<p>[Our Dispatch] The Jianghua Company's Huayuan ship returned to Shanghai from Chongqing yesterday afternoon, carrying 674 boxes of silver dollars.

<h3 id="e116">Yarn Market Trends Downward <a href="#e116" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c116" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">116</a></h3>
<p>Cotton Cloth Asking Prices Rise and Then Soften</p>
<p>Due to the great victory of the National Army in Xuzhou, the yarn market became pessimistic. Scattering increased, and selling began again. Asking prices in the market stepped down. 42-count Blue Phoenix yarn was quoted at 9,450 yuan. Tomorrow's release was 10,200-10,300 yuan, but there were few buyers. Finally, it was released at 9,800 yuan, leveling with the previous day. 40-count Blue Phoenix also stepped down to 8,700 yuan at the close.</p>
<p>32-count Silver Moon 8,000 yuan, 21-count Double Horse 6,800 yuan, 20-count Jincheng 6,300 yuan, 16-count Guangming 6,700 yuan, 10-count Boy Scout 4,000 yuan. Throughout the day, the prices of all counts of coarse and fine yarn were generally lower than the previous day, ranging from 100-200 yuan to 600-700 yuan.</p>
<p>Another Report: The cotton yarn market was temporarily closed for trading yesterday. No trading took place in the market. The reason for the temporary closure was that the entry permits had not been completely exchanged. For several days after the market opened, the front door was not open, and personnel entering the market were entering and exiting through the back door. The authorities corrected this, so trading was temporarily suspended yesterday. Personnel arriving at the market were trading outside the market. Market conditions were smaller than yesterday.</p>
<p>Yesterday, cotton cloth asking prices outside the market continued to decline following the previous day's weakness. 12-yard Nengtou fine cloth initially asked for 300 yuan, briefly declining to 290 yuan. Later, as credit conditions eased, buyers took advantage of the low prices to make purchases, and local retail sales also came to replenish stocks. Sellers, hearing that rice prices were rising, were mostly unwilling to sell lightly. At midday, prices stepped up to 320 yuan at the close, recovering 10 yuan from the previous day. Four Gentlemen yuan beiji also improved 15 yuan, to 330 yuan. After the close, hearing that yarn prices were trending down, sentiment weakened again. 320 yuan for Longtou fine cloth found no buyers.</p>
<h3 id="e117">Cotton Market Flat and Soft <a href="#e117" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c117" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">117</a></h3>
<p>The spot cotton market remained flat yesterday. Cotton yarn trended weak, and factories showed no interest. The Joint Purchasing Association absorbed a small amount. Prices were slightly weak. Zhoupu seed cotton continued to trade at 280-300 yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e118">Credit Conditions Ease: Ample Funds <a href="#e118" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c118" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">118</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, credit conditions trended loose and harmonious. The supply of funds in the market was very strong. Although there were also many demanders, turnover was exceptionally flexible. The hidden interest rate was between 7.5 and 9 jiao per month. Cash funds were particularly ample. Financial institutions uniformly increased the withdrawal limits.</p>
<h3 id="e119">Overseas Remittance Income Increases Sharply <a href="#e119" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c119" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">119</a></h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] Since the implementation of the revised measures for the gold yuan, overseas remittance income has increased sharply. As of the 15th of this month, the Nanyang overseas remittances received by the Xiamen branch of the Bank of China alone reached a substantial amount of 1.5 million US dollars and 6,000 Hong Kong dollars.</p>
<p>Another Report: The Ministry of Finance convened a meeting in Nanjing on the 13th of this month to discuss the issue of using special foreign currency certificates of deposit. Representatives from the Central Trust Bureau and the Transportation Management Committee of the China Industrial Corporation attended. After the measures were agreed upon, they were submitted to the Executive Yuan for approval. It is understood that, in principle, the portion of the government's compulsory purchase can be fully used, while the portion allocated for sale will be given at the official price.</p>
<h3 id="e120">Jiangsu and Zhejiang Silk Weaving Manufacturers Come to Shanghai: Requesting a Reduction in the Allocated Price of Artificial Silk <a href="#e120" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c120" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">120</a></h3>
<p>The Central Trust Bureau allocated the 80th installment of rayon to silk weaving manufacturers in various regions last week. Because the fixed price was too high and market prices were frequently falling, the silk weaving manufacturers did not go to collect their allocations. They unanimously requested the Central Trust Bureau to reduce the allocated price. According to the regulations of the Executive Yuan, it should be calculated at 80% of the market price, but the Central Trust Bureau has not yet agreed. Silk weaving manufacturers from Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces sent representatives to Shanghai yesterday to meet with silk weaving manufacturers in Shanghai to negotiate with the Central Trust Bureau today to request a reduction in the allocated price and continue the allocation, in order to avoid fueling rampant black market silk weaving prices during the suspension period.</p>

<p>[Our Dispatch] Since the government changed its policies, the Office of the Economic Management Supervisory Commissioner in this city has been working to close all cases handled in the past, and it is expected that all cases can be completed by the beginning of next week. As for the case of exchanging 20,000 bolts of cotton cloth for rice, the account books and documents of the rice merchants have not yet been submitted, so it is still impossible to complete the closing work.</p>
<h3 id="e122">Sugar Market Calm <a href="#e122" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c122" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">122</a></h3>
<p>Because the Taiwan Sugar Company's allocated quantity of Taiqi sugar was slightly more than the previous installment, local buyers' stomachs were saturated, and market sentiment was stable. The various other commodities were mostly weak, and local retail sales were sluggish. In the market, supply and demand were balanced, and the trend was calm, with no drastic fluctuations from the opening to the closing of the market.</p>
<h3 id="e123">Demand From All Sides is Very Strong: Rice Continues to Rise <a href="#e123" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c123" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">123</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, rice prices continued to rise. White geng was approaching seven guan. Although the supply to the market was smoother than before, merchants took the opportunity to support prices because of strong demand from all sides, and the market trend rose sharply. Yesterday, the markets for various industries outside the rice market all fell, but rice prices alone rose, because some rice shops still did not sell rice widely, and after the cost of living index was released, some employees bought food after receiving their salaries. Because supply was less than demand, market prices rose again. However, rice prices in the surrounding rural areas were still cheap, and rice prices at the place of origin were also between 300 and 400 yuan. In theory, rice prices in the Shanghai market should not rise sharply.</p>
<p>Yesterday, 1476 shi and 6 dou of goods arrived at the South Market, and trading was brisk. White geng traded at 600 yuan, thin rice at 600 yuan, and early rice at 580 yuan. More goods arrived at the North Market, totaling 1910 shi, and the opening prices were higher than those in the South Market, with white geng at 660 yuan, thin rice at 680 yuan, and early rice at 680 yuan, an average increase of about 30-40%.</p>
<p>Because of fluctuations in rice prices, the flour market saw strong retail sales and strong buying interest, and market prices rose uniformly. Laoche flour initially opened at a high price of 200 yuan, but because its price exceeded yesterday's by 40 yuan, hoarders took advantage of the high prices to sell, and market prices turned weak, closing at 185 yuan. Delivered Laoche flour traded at 193 yuan. Bingship flour opened at 200 yuan and closed at 180 yuan, an increase of 30 yuan from yesterday's market. Delivered traded at 190 yuan. Other brands, such as Peacock 187 yuan, Lighthouse 195 yuan, Red Bee 175 yuan, and Jiancheng 177 yuan, all uniformly rose by about 20%. Bran turned strong. Fuxin Fufeng opened at 130 yuan, with a highest price of 145 yuan to 140 yuan, closing at 118 yuan.</p>
<p>The prices of miscellaneous grains uniformly rose, and trading was slightly more active. Corn rose by 25 yuan, peanuts rose by 40 yuan, and soybeans rose by 40 yuan to 60 yuan, etc.</p>
<p>Due to the rise in commodities outside the market and the increase in retail sales in the oil market, the price of pure raw oil from the local factory was 1150 yuan, an increase of 100 yuan from yesterday's market. Raw vegetable oil opened at a high price of 820 yuan, but the subsequent market weakened to 750 yuan at the close. Cooked vegetable oil traded quite a bit at 700 yuan. Soybean oil from the local factory opened at 950 yuan. After the opening, hoarders sold off a lot, and the subsequent market fell back to 880 yuan. Changzi bean cake was 82 yuan, also up 10 yuan from before.</p>
<h3 id="e124">New Atmosphere in Lin'an: Climbing to the Eastern Tianmu Mountain <a href="#e124" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c124" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">124</a></h3>
<p>— Special Correspondent for This Newspaper, Chu Yusheng</p>
<p>[Our Dispatch from Hangzhou, 16th] Traveling west from Hangzhou along the Hanghui Road, passing through Yuhang to reach Lin'an, I had traveled this road at the end of the summer of 1946. At that time, the highway was dilapidated, and the towns were almost completely destroyed by artillery fire. The broken ruins were a terrible sight. This time, I was invited by the location scouting team of the China Electric No. 1 Factory's "Searching for Dreams" film, and I was able to revisit this old place. In the two years since I had last been here, the dilapidated highway had been transformed into a flat road, and the chaotic places had become orderly. In particular, the newly emerging municipal construction in Lin'an County had transformed the dilapidated county government office into a new, magnificent county government office. The destroyed streets had been rebuilt into flat roads, and the houses that had been burned and demolished were being rebuilt along both sides of the road. Most commendably, it was impossible to find a single beggar in Lin'an City. Shops opened at 6:00 AM and closed at 10:00 PM. Amidst the current economic turmoil, it was truly a Shangri-La rarely seen in cities.</p>
<p>85% Harvest This Year</p>
<p>The counties of Yu, Lin, Yu, and Chang all had bumper harvests this year. Lin'an had more than 85%. The best income came from tea, because Longjing tea was selling well this year, and tea merchants came to Lin'an to purchase tea for sale as Longjing tea. Next was silk floss. This year, cocoons sold for a lot of money. One dan was enough to exchange for several dan of rice. Bamboo shoots also sold well. Although the output of sand peaches and green beans was not high, they also generated good income. The increased value of goods produced in the countryside guaranteed the peace and tranquility of Lin'an.</p>
<p>County Magistrate Yang Weili told me: "If you want to run the county government well, you must have sufficient tax revenue. To have sufficient tax revenue, you must eliminate tax evasion. When paying taxes in Lin'an, I am the first to pay the taxes that I owe myself. This makes it embarrassing for everyone not to pay. If there are still people who deliberately fail to pay, they will be severely punished. Therefore, the collection of land tax, house tax, business tax, and slaughter tax in Lin'an is quite good.</p>
<p>Loans to Build Houses</p>
<p>"Regarding local construction projects, we will never impose levies on the local people. For example, the construction of the county government office used the county government's surplus from the past two years. The repair of the roads also used this money. The county government loaned half of the funds to build the shops on both sides of the road, with grain as the loan object. The interest rate is only one jin of grain per dan and can be repaid in installments. The people are grateful for such low costs and naturally build houses.</p>
<p>"The rural roads have all been completed, using labor service during the agricultural off-season. Telephones have also been installed throughout the county. As for small-scale farmland irrigation, as long as the people apply, the county government will conduct a field survey and, if it is true, will lend grain for construction without any conditions."</p>

<p>Lin'an is the location of the Commissioner's Office of the Ninth District of Zhejiang Province. Commissioner Tan Naida used to be a division commander. He told me: "Nothing has happened in the Ninth District this year." Judging from the situation in Lin'an, it is indeed very peaceful, and the farmers are also able to get by.</p>
<p>Lin'an boasts the beauty of Eastern Tianmu Mountain (Note: Yuqian has Western Tianmu, which I visited in 1946 and wrote about). It is about 40 li from Lin'an County. The road from the city to Eastern Tianmu Mountain was built by the county government, which mobilized labor service. Cars can travel on it. Although the road surface is not as good as the highway, it is not easy to develop this road with the county's resources, especially with several dangerous construction projects along the way.</p>
<p>Arriving at Eastern Tianmu Mountain and Climbing the Mountain</p>
<p>As we approached Eastern Tianmu Mountain, we saw clusters of trees, piles of houses, heads of cattle, and flocks of chickens and ducks along the way. The fields had all been harvested, and the firewood was stacked neatly. White tea blossoms covered the tea bushes, and bamboos whispered in the wind.</p>
<p>We arrived at the foot of Eastern Tianmu Mountain and walked a little more than half a kilometer, ascending the mountain step by step. For every half kilometer climbed, there was a section of flat road. Arriving at Sanli Pavilion, we looked down at the mountains and the quiet villages, which were like paintings. The red leaves were abundant, interspersed with tender yellow and deep green branches and leaves.</p>
<p>Climbing further to Sili Pavilion and Wuli Pavilion, we saw a waterfall hanging in the distance, more than ten zhang long. Above Wuli Pavilion, people in the valley shouted, and the mountains echoed. At this time, we saw red leaves all over the mountains, blood-red azaleas, and Nandina domestica like red beans. Pines and junipers occupied the mountains on all sides.</p>
<p>Zhaoming Temple is Like a Fairyland</p>
<p>Climbing another four li, we saw towering trees, all several arm spans in circumference. Further ahead, there was a stone bridge, ancient and mottled, with moss covering the steps. Next to the bridge was a pavilion. In front of the bridge was a stone wall with a hanging waterfall. We passed under the bridge and entered a deep ravine. We crossed the bridge and climbed up the steps. Beside the mountain was a pavilion. Further up, there was a forest of giant trees, and under the forest was a stone path leading to Zhaoming Temple. The grand sound of a bell struck deep into our hearts, and we felt as if we had entered a "fairyland."</p>
<p>The temple was very large, capable of accommodating thousands of people. The Buddha statues were not as grand as those at Lingyin and Jingci Temples, but many people came from Fuyang and other counties to fulfill vows and burn incense, and all stayed at the temple. According to the old monk, "There were electric lights before the war. The generator was donated by Mei Lanfang, and Cai Yuanpei also came here." We went to the Washing Eyes Pond, where Prince Zhaoming washed his eyes. Prince Zhaoming compiled scriptures in Eastern Tianmu, and his eyes went blind. He washed his eyes at the Washing Eyes Pond and regained his sight, hence the name. From here, we could see arhat pines growing on the opposite mountain peak.</p>
<p>China Electric Films the "Searching for Dreams" Film</p>
<p>I feel that the beauty of Eastern Tianmu lies in its elegance, while Western Tianmu has towering ancient trees, giving it a majestic atmosphere. China Electric No. 1 Factory filmed a newsreel here called "Autumn in Tianmu." Because of its excellent location, they came here specifically to film the location scenes for "Searching for Dreams." "Searching for Dreams" tells the story of a journalist, directed by Tang Huang and starring Du Lizhu. The county magistrate was very helpful and helped them find solutions to the problems of food, lodging, and accommodation.</p>
<p>The county magistrate also told me: "We are planning to build another highway to Western Tianmu." Then both Eastern and Western Tianmu can be visited from Lin'an.</p>
<p>During my two days in Lin'an, I truly felt that this county was very peaceful. I hope that it will strive for even greater progress in its peace.</p>

<p>— Special Correspondent for This Newspaper, Fei Chaoran</p>
<p>[Our Dispatch from Bengbu, 15th] Because our forces in Bengbu City are strong, people's hearts are exceptionally calm. Commerce, which had been stagnant for many days, is gradually recovering. The Victoria and National cinemas and other theaters are still operating as usual, and the audience is still extremely crowded. Li Yannian, Deputy Commander-in-Chief of the Xuzhou Pacification Headquarters, convened a meeting of the heads of various agencies in Bengbu City on the 14th and announced 24 important points: All agency personnel are not allowed to take leave, and they must provide written guarantees of their thoughts and actions. The Bank of Communications, the Central Farmers Bank, and various flour mills must not suspend operations. The municipal government will organize rescue, transportation, and communication teams to assist the garrison in defense. A census will be conducted to prevent spies. Internal and external defenses of the urban area will be strengthened. Curfew in the city will begin early, at 9:30 PM every night, etc. Later, Deng Wenyi, Director of the Political Work Bureau of the Ministry of National Defense, announced that there was indeed a good chance of victory in the Xuzhou campaign. Commander Hu reported that the city's forces were strong and that public order was absolutely guaranteed. The tracks on the Jinpu Railway from Shimenshan, Xiaoxihe, Zhanglaoying, and on the Huainan Railway from Xiatangji and Zhujiaxiang were successively blown up in small sections by bandits, but were quickly repaired and reopened. On the night of the 14th, the bridge near Wudian on the Huainan Railway was also burned by bandits. It is being repaired on the 15th and should be open to traffic on the 16th.</p>
<p>In recent days, prices have soared like wild horses. Rice is 300 yuan per shi, flour is 60 yuan per bag, pork is 8 yuan per jin, sesame oil is 8 yuan per jin, and other items have risen by seven or eight times. The common people are all crying out in pain. The trains on the various lines are not on time, and passengers are extremely crowded, to the point where there is no room to stand.</p>
<h3 id="e126">From the Communist Army's Strength and Strategy: The Xuzhou-Bengbu Great Battle <a href="#e126" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c126" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">126</a></h3>
<p>— Yang Li</p>
<p>[Times Agency Dispatch] The Xuzhou-Bengbu campaign is another battle with the largest troop concentration in the Central China region since the Yellow River Flooded Area campaign. In the month or two prior to this, the Communists had been actively operating in the Huaihe region. Local Communist forces formed the Huaihe Military District, with Chen Qingxian, commander of the 12th Column of the Communist Army, as the military district commander. The Communist bandit troops of Jin Shaoshan, Wei Fenglou, Zhao Huichuan, and Sun Chuanjia grew from several thousand people to one or two tens of thousands of people each, attempting to occupy the areas on both sides of the Jinpu Railway and the areas on both banks of the Huaihe River, opening up a corridor to the Dabie Mountains, in order to lay the foundation for the Communist main forces to come south in the future. Therefore, after the Yellow River Flooded Area campaign, Liu Bocheng left behind seeds in this area. After the National Army launched encirclement and suppression operations in northern Jiangsu, two columns of Communist troops had fled back to southern Shandong, and one column remained in northern Jiangsu. The Yancheng-Funing area had never been completely pacified, and local Communist teams continued to operate on the north bank of the Yangtze River. Before the Xuzhou-Bengbu campaign, two columns from southern Shandong again fled back to northern Jiangsu. After Dongtai was captured, the Communists attempted to bypass and attack Taizhou and Baoying, isolating Gaoyou and Baoying and impeding the National Army's actions west of Hongze Lake. The Communist troops moving south also moved through the Lian-Shu area to Si County, Lingbi, Fengyang, and Xuyi and Tianchang, coordinating with the Communist troops in the Huaihe River region to complete the encirclement of Bengbu. Although this was mostly the activity of local Communist forces, it had a great impact on transportation to the rear, and their intentions could not be ignored.</p>
<p>Furthermore, looking at the strength and deployment of the Communist regular army: Chen Yi has five corps, a total of sixteen columns. Eleven columns may be used in Xuzhou-Bengbu, distributed in southern Shandong, the Jinpu front, and western Shandong. Liu Bocheng has twelve columns. Six columns may be used in Xuzhou-Bengbu, part in western Shandong and part in eastern Henan. Chen Geng has four columns in western Henan, and two columns may flee east. In total, the maximum number of Communist troops participating in the Xuzhou-Bengbu campaign is nineteen to twenty-one columns, with a force of 350,000 to 400,000 people. Gathering the main forces of the three Communist armies, its scale will not be larger than the Liaoxi campaign. After the National Army's forces have been assembled, they are more than twice the size of the Communist army. Combined with the convenience of transportation and supply lines, their mobility is greater than that of the Communist army. Therefore, launching an offensive with an inferior force is not allowed in the Communist strategy. "Do not fight a battle without a chance of winning" is what the Communists have repeatedly emphasized. In the Xuzhou-Bengbu campaign, can they still use the "human wave tactics" to fight? Therefore, there are few opportunities for a direct decisive battle in the Xuzhou-Bengbu campaign. The Communist attack method may adopt the following approaches: First, go south from southern Shandong, passing between Xuzhou and Haizhou, cut off the Xuzhou-Huaiyin transportation, and enter the west bank of Dao Hongze Lake, threatening Bengbu, or even advancing further south of Bengbu. Second, bypass the Yellow River Flooded Area from western Shandong, enter northern Anhui, and coordinate with local Communist forces to enter southern Anhui, threatening the left wing of Xuzhou-Bengbu. Third, a force may come east from the border between Henan and Hubei, re-enter the Dabie Mountains, advance to western Anhui, and threaten the Chaohu area. In summary, the Communist army is using the southern section of the Jinpu Railway as the strategic attack center. After a fierce offensive, it may adopt the tactics of "expanding the area," "isolating points," and "cutting off lines" to create a long-term disturbance in the Huaihe region and on both sides of Hongze Lake. It may also send a force of infantry across the Yangtze River between Hubei, Anhui, and Jiangxi to disturb the rear areas of Jiangsu, Anhui, and Zhejiang, threatening the rear of Nanjing and Shanghai. A diversionary battle may also be launched in the outer areas of Wuhan or the southern section of the Pinghan Railway. Therefore, the Xuzhou-Bengbu campaign is a decisive battle between the Yangtze and Yellow Rivers. This decisive battle can determine the situation between the Yangtze and Huai Rivers. At the same time, this battlefield is on the periphery of Nanjing and Shanghai and can also be seen as the defense of Nanjing and Shanghai. The National Army is determined to win without defeat. It has prepared for two months in terms of time, and has abandoned unnecessary burdens in terms of strategy. As long as the main force of the National Army is intact, the ins and outs of the points and lines cannot determine the overall situation. In this decisive battle, if more than half of the Communist main forces can be annihilated, the points and lines abandoned south of the Yellow River can be recovered in a matter of time. The current problem is that the National Army has the confidence to annihilate the Communists. It depends on whether the citizens of Nanjing and Shanghai can provide the soldiers on the front lines with spiritual or material assistance. In particular, the rear must first seek stability for themselves. A victory in battle will solve all problems. The defense of Nanjing and Shanghai depends on this one battle!</p>

<h3 id="e133">Baby Theft Incident <a href="#e133" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c133" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">133</a></h3>
<p>— Thunder</p>
<p>Recently, a baby theft case occurred in Tianjin, the protagonist of which was a young woman, Han Guo Hongti, who pretended to be nine months pregnant (see this newspaper on the 14th of this month). In today's extremely difficult living conditions, what the young woman stole was not money, nor food, but a rather cumbersome baby. No wonder people generally find it "strange," and some even think it is a rather humorous comedy.</p>
<p>This is indeed a ready-made comedy material because it seems to have elements of lightness, humor, and a bit of unexpectedness. However, this is just the view of outsiders. In the heart of the lead actress, Han Guo Hongti, she not only does not feel the above atmosphere at all, but on the contrary, she is acting in an atmosphere of tension, terror, and excitement, this scene that seems to be a comedy on the surface, but is actually a genuine tragedy. Because the initiator of this incident is not Han Guo Hongti, who actually committed the theft, nor her family members, such as her aunt and husband. Its real director is an invisible and intangible potential force, a very strong potential force deeply hidden in the hearts of ordinary people. In a word: it is the lingering poison of the feudal system that has been traditional in our country for thousands of years.</p>
<p>The annotations of this remaining poison, found in the classics of sages, are: "There are three forms of unfilial piety, and having no descendants is the greatest"; "A mother is honored through her son"; "…: those without sons shall be expelled." In the past, even now, the traditional thinking of the Chinese people has always been accustomed to pushing all crimes onto the weak. (Recently, didn't we also see the movie "Weakness, thy name is woman"?) Therefore, the crime of "unfilial piety" is borne by women; the crime of not being "honored" because of having no "son" is also borne by women; even the crime of being "expelled" is naturally borne by women. "Blaming fate and not complaining," of course, has nothing to do with the husband.</p>
<p>For example, the clause "those without sons shall be expelled" no longer seems to constitute a condition for divorce. However, the husband can hold up the big hat of "having no descendants is the greatest" as a reason for taking concubines. From a legal point of view, it does violate current laws, but this law-breaking husband can easily obtain the forgiveness and sympathy of his family, the forgiveness and sympathy of society, and even the forgiveness and sympathy of his wife. In such cases, although the wife is not publicly "expelled," isn't it equivalent to being semi-publicly "expelled"? And such events, for people like us in our forties, who have heard and witnessed them, are really not few.</p>
<p>Based on the above analysis, plus what we may have heard and seen, we can get a glimpse of the pain in the heart of the lead actress in this comedy. Therefore, we cannot just see the light surface and ignore the sour content.</p>
<p>Now let's chew over the process of this fact. First, she "pretended to be pregnant, since February, and it has been more than nine months now"; second, she "went to Ma Daifu Hospital several times, asking for a baby, but to no avail"; third, she "went to the hospital again on the tenth, and in desperation, she stole a baby from the nursery and walked out"; fourth, she "falsely claimed that it was born by her cousin and was admitted to Tongde Hospital." (The original text is all from this newspaper)</p>
<p>This is the process of her performance in this comedy. From this process, we can see how painstaking she is. But who did it for her, who caused it? Can we still look at her with a comedic mood? Can we still add the crime of theft to her?</p>
<p>What kind of punishment should she receive legally for this incident? I don't understand. But if you say that she has a well-deserved crime, then this crime should be attributed to the remaining poison of the feudal system!</p>
<p>Who is to blame for this kind of thing still happening today?</p>
<h3 id="e134">Talking About Qualifications <a href="#e134" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c134" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">134</a></h3>
<p>— A Dan</p>
<p>Civil servants, except for specially appointed officials who do not consider qualifications, others, from employees to senior officials, all need to talk about qualifications. The person in charge of personnel can report to the superior authority for qualification and salary determination based on qualifications. However, the items listed on this "Civil Servant Resume Form" make people who are new to officialdom feel very troublesome.</p>
<p>Name, alias, gender, address (divided into present and permanent), date of birth, must specify the year, month, and day of the Republic of China, current age, party affiliation, and religious belief must also be filled in. Doctor's physical examination, divided into: height, left and right eyes and ears, chest circumference surplus and deficiency difference, limbs, heart, blood pressure, physical characteristics, lungs, others, overall evaluation, etc. Family members are divided into name, age, alive or dead, occupation, and notes. Education must specify the name of the school or training institution, department, start and end years of study, graduation or肄業, and degree. Examinations are also divided into year and name, type of subject, grade, certificate number, and examination authority. Name of writings or inventions, academic category. Specialty, interests, or rewards and punishments received must also be written clearly, and four photos must be attached.</p>
<p>Job assignment and salary depend on experience. All previous experience must be reported. However, qualifications for positions held under the Beijing government before 1927 cannot be written in. Writing it in does not count. Experience is divided into service agency name, position, duties, grade salary, date of arrival, date of resignation, and name of certificate, etc. The most important thing is the resignation certificate. If there is only a dispatch order for arrival and no resignation certificate, then even if you have done a long job for ten or eight years, it will only be counted as one month. There is also the銓叙 process, the number of steps to fill in, if not, naturally, you can not fill in. And in a resume form, in addition to the signature and seal of the person, the signature and seal of the head of the agency and the person in charge of personnel are also required. At the same time, two civil servants with higher positions than the person must sign a letter of guarantee before the formalities are completed and you are officially a civil servant.</p>
<p>Graduates with a high school degree, the initial salary is 75 yuan, and those with a junior college degree or above are 140 yuan. If you start from a university graduate and want to reach a荐任 position, it takes seven years, and to reach a簡任 position, it takes seventeen years. These years must be uninterrupted work, and the assessment can be promoted. Otherwise, even if you hold a certain position and receive a certain level of salary, it is a matter for this agency, and the銓叙 will not pass.</p>
<p>The qualifications of overseas Chinese affairs, Mongolian and Tibetan committees, and secretaries-general and secretaries of various agencies are not limited, which is special.</p>
<p>If the certificates for the War of Resistance are lost, the proof of the principal, teacher, or classmate, or former superior colleague, can be used as an official certificate, but the service agency of the person issuing the certificate must be stamped with a seal. Because there is this flexible approach, countless false certificates are produced. Some people, for the sake of friendship, "do good to others," then prove that someone has held a certain position and received a certain salary, etc. Personnel managers know the falsehood, and most do not pursue it. Therefore, during the War of Resistance, countless civil servants' salaries increased. If there are real lost certificates that cannot be obtained, and are downgraded, this is really "deserved" and has nothing to do with others.</p>
<h3 id="e135">Frost <a href="#e135" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c135" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">135</a></h3>
<p>— Xi Hou</p>
<p>"The thinnest is the autumn frost." When I was young, after hearing this sentence, I had a deep impression of the emptiness and harshness of autumn frost. Compared to near middle age, not only are the grasses withered and the trees bare, and the seasons are alarming; but even the delicate jade and pearl rice are cooked, and the clothes are wide and the belt is left over, I also deeply feel the autumn frost-like taste of the world.</p>
<p>In fact, the frost in nature is solemn and beautiful. Although it is not as lively as the sound of rain, or as easygoing as the moonlight; but when you get up early on a clear autumn day and look out the window, the tiles are tiled, white and black, like a pattern, as if you are in an art class. At this time, the streets are silent, only the magpies on the treetops, pecking at the first sunlight. Soon, the morning light sprinkles on the house, and the slight traces disappear darkly, and the shady places appear even more white. Few people are willing to appreciate this kind of scenery early in the morning.</p>
<p>In the thick autumn morning fog, walking in the fields, covered with frost, stepping on the frozen soil, between the broken grass and rubble, shallow footprints remain, gradually feeling the sunrise and the fog thinning; the collars and sleeves are cold and warm, the sparse forest is red and green, the narrow path is winding, the firewood doors are closed in the cold, and the茅亭is covered in white. "No one is in the lonely mountains, and the falling leaves make a dry sound." This is a broken sentence from an old mountain residence. I only hate not being able to be on the border of a remote fortress, hearing the dawn horn.</p>
<p>When I was a guest in Hankou, I first learned to compose lyrics, and I once used the tune "Cui Lou Yin" to sing about frost. The topic was very new, and few people had written about it. Later, I read "Hui Feng Ci" and found this topic. The Guizhou poet Zhou Yuhuang also had a collection of "Poems about Frost from One Word to Seven Words," with the concluding sentence being "Nothing can be sold except the center of the mirror." I remember that my clumsy words had "A wisp of flying soul, taking advantage of the small sideburns and yellow flowers, sticking with fragrance." Also, "Sorrowfully, the people on the Banqiao Bridge are far away, and it is impossible to find them again." They were all extremely naive. At that time, I asked Mr. Wang Zhupu for advice, and I was also given a harmonious demonstration. Now I silently remember Wang's words below:</p>
<p>The wild geese carry sorrow, the crickets talk about coldness, the west wind is thin and the yellow flowers are. The perching birds startled the moon, choking the flute, the coldness sneaking through. Threads of fragrant heart, ask the little Yunying, how long have you been holding on? Pavilion interest, Lin Fei纈, pointing to the red砧 woman. Recognize it, shallow grass pond, a small mandarin duck first arrived, dawn traces added. Stealing red maple leaves; it is also white 收 芦絮. Emei暗妒, calculate off 婵娟, the moon shame 斜去. Heaven should allow, deceiving Pan 岳, 负奋恋舞. (Cui Lou Yin)</p>
<p>Now, after nineteen years, having experienced the vicissitudes of life, I have long been in danger and have no words. The autumn wind is on the sea, the view is bleak, remembering the old and thinking of the people, unconsciously my temples are starry.</p>
<h3 id="e136">Remembering Wu Shuangya <a href="#e136" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c136" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">136</a></h3>
<p>— Chen Zuogao</p>
<p>The eclectic master Wu Shuangya (named Mei, courtesy name Qu'an, Shuangya is his hao), wrote and possessed the strengths of composing lyrics, making scores, and measuring voices. He was particularly rich in nationalistic ideas throughout his life. At first, he learned to write songs, mostly asking his friend Wu Cuilun (named Youxiao) to fill in the gongchi. In the year of Gui Mao, he began to write "Blood Flower Flying" (a legendary name), writing about the bloody events of the revolution, implying the massacre in the Tartar court and the slaughter of all barbarian races. At that time, Qu'an's father was still alive, fearing disaster, so he burned it. He said that later, in the year of Jia Chen, he wrote "Wind Cave Mountain," and in the year of Bing Wu, he wrote "Warming Fragrance Building" (both legendary names). He received guidance from Huang Moses, and his learning improved day by day, while Pan Yangchun guided him in advance. What he saw and heard, and what he gained from making friends, was compiled into "She Motha Room Song Talk." In his own inscription on the legend of "Wind Cave Mountain," he said: "Well, well, Tang Tang swallows ancient sorrow, Hong Ya himself 按 梁州, Moling Mountain color 珠江 moon, not抵崖山 a leaf boat." It is said that Emperor Sizong of Ming committed suicide, and the people of the southeast, calmly did their best, and the cabinet minister Lin Gui, swore an oath, and the feelings of passion were overflowing.</p>
<p>He was a descendant of Wu Qingfang (named Zhongjun), a member of the Hanlin Academy of the late Qing Dynasty, and was of the same clan as Wu Weiru (Yusheng). One was registered in Changzhou, and the other was registered in Yuanhe. Both of them inherited family instructions and encouraged each other with integrity, generation after generation. In the years of Ji Ji and Geng Wu, he resigned from the professorship of Zhongda University and responded to the invitation of Mr. Wang in Shanghai to teach his children. He drank a bottle of brandy and listened to茄立克 every day. The guests and hosts rejoiced, and the southeast was beautiful. Later, he left for other reasons. During the War of Resistance Against Japan, he moved west with the government. He traveled long distances and endured hardships. Finally, he ended up in Dayao County, Yunnan. Then, he was trapped by the loss of his voice, and accumulated illnesses and could not get up. He died at the home of his disciple Li Yiping, and was temporarily buried in the back garden of the Li family. According to Huang Xiaozhi Xiangjian (Zi Duanmu) of the Ming Dynasty, his father Kong Zhao, once served as the magistrate of Dayao County. When the Ming Dynasty was about to perish, the passes were blocked, and Xiaozhi traveled alone for thousands of miles to reach the county to find his relatives. These two people, both came to this land, "loyal to the country, a filial to relatives, worthy of 후선표병." Three years after his death, his disciples Xu Yifan and others initiated a third anniversary sacrifice in Shanghai, and exhibited his posthumous works and practiced singing posthumous songs. For a time, Guan Yan gathered and mourned together.</p>

<p>— Qiang</p>
<p>Don't think that chickens are gentle birds. In fact, they are inherently combative. The spurs on the legs of roosters are specially used as kicking hooks, and the weapons of hens are their sharp calls. Fights between chickens can cause bloodshed at the slightest, and death at the worst, which is a great loss to the owners of chicken farms. One of the tools to prevent chicken fights is a special kind of glasses. These glasses are made of aluminum and artificial ivory. After they are placed on the chicken's eyes, the chicken's field of vision is restricted; it can only see to the sides, and cannot see straight ahead. Since it cannot see ahead, the chickens cannot fight each other.</p>

<p>— Zhang Yiqu</p>
<p>Twice a year, I go on an outing: Taowu is fragrant and Jupu is quiet; the seasons change with the flowers and trees, and I take my children to recognize spring and autumn (spring outing to Longhua, autumn outing to Qibao, both with my children).</p>
<p>The villagers scoop water and talk about the harvest, draining the pond to fish is a struggle for food; the eyes are full of 涸 　 regardless of size, also helping each other with saliva to live (on the way to Qibao, seeing farmers scooping water to fish).</p>
<p>Looking at the southern and northern fields, hundreds of acres are all good fields. Shennong is not a myth after all. Who said that farming has lost its secrets (Qibao has a new agricultural school, reclaiming hundreds of acres of land)?</p>
<p>I leave a cup of Beihai at will, and the chrysanthemums can entertain the wine, and the host is busy; countless碎黄贞白 autumns, drunk eyes still pity the green buds (President Chai Zifei of the agricultural school left wine to enjoy the chrysanthemums, among which green chrysanthemums are the most precious).</p>
