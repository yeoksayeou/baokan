<p>〔美國新聞處華盛頓四日電〕杜魯門總統今日發表一項公吿，宣布關於關稅及貿易之總協定，將於一九四八年五月廿二日對中國生效。美國係於去年十月廿日在日內瓦與其他廿二國簽訂此項協定。總統採取此項行動，係於獲悉中國政府業已於一九四八年四月廿一日簽字於總協定臨時實施草案之後。依照該項草案之規定，中國將於簽字日三十天以後使該項協定生效。中國係使該協定生效之第十一國家，並爲遠東各國中第一使該協定生效者。除美國以外，其他使該協定生效國家有：英國，法國，比利時，荷蘭，盧森堡，加拿大，澳洲，古巴及捷克。根據總協定，中國對美國所需之物品，予以讓步，就一九三九年貿易論，此項物　約値五千二百萬美元。舉凡辦公室機件，輕量車輛，車床，罐頭牛乳，潤滑油及油脂及車胎與眞空管，其現有進口稅，均多减低。　對於其他廣泛範圍中之各項物品，其目前稅率大部已被認爲普遍低下者，則此項稅率將予保持。此等物資中包括與美國有關者，如棉花，烟草，小麥，麵粉，若干乾果，無綫電，除輕量級以外之摩托車輛及車床，農業機械，抽水機，冰箱，機械工具，若千食物及特種染料。中國及協定之其他簽字國，對於申請外匯，轍入限制，外匯管制，海關估價及國營貿易之進行等，均須受若千限制。此等規定甚為重要，因此等規定使中國及其他簽字國對於美國之貿易，必須予以公正之待遇。美國在總協定中對華輸出貨物之讓步適用於以一九三九年爲標準價値近六千二百卅萬美元之貨物。在此項貿易中有三千七百八十萬美元之產品列入現行美國免稅單內。在協定中美國允予减低關稅而對中國之利益具有主要關係之項目中，計有　，鎢，冷藏之乾鷄蛋，胡桃，帽辮，總花與有花邊之服飾，繡花手帕與若干油類。桐油，生絲與若千種毛皮與獸皮等項，依然可以免稅輸入。目前對猪鬃所定之稅率，保證不致增加。此種讓步，須在參與商議之各政府機關經最審愼之考慮並公開陳述意見後始能給予，藉以確定國內之生產商不致因此等讓步而蒙嚴重損害。然此等讓步中之任何一項，苟因事先不能預料情形而使來自中國之輸入增加至如此程度，以致對本國之生產商引起嚴重損害或造成此種威脅時，美國仍可撤回此等讓步，或將其修正至如此程度，藉以防止或補救此種損失。此項規定，因此對本國生產商之利益，提供保障。</p>

<p>〔中央社南京五日電〕中央黨部秘書長吳鐵城，五日談其對於樹立民主作風及國民黨黨員發揮團結力量之期望，首先指出世界上任何民主國家欲圖推行民主政治，普遍深入，而有輝煌之成就，必須於人人守法之外更力求培養良好政治習慣，因民主政治之成敗政府固有重責，而人民態度如何亦屬最大關鍵。每一人民俱能關心政治，理解政治，明是非，辨曲直，方能達成民有民治民享之政治。先進各國政治家莫不努力於創造良好政治習慣，成爲一種不成文法律便發生永久的示範作用，其效力比成文法律更爲巨大。英美之民主作風，即建立於此牢不可拔之基礎上。此次總統副總統之競選，堪稱良好模範，勝者固不驕，敗者亦自得，二者之間，不特無絲毫芥蒂，而且互相道賀慰勉，此種作風，洵可珍貴。吳氏復稱：在民主國家非有政黨不足以運用政治，爲識者所共喻，而政黨能否善於運用政治，胥視其本身是否有適當應時代需要之政策與堅强之團結力。政黨能全黨凝成一體，發揮整個力量，以推行其爲人民謀福利爲國家求進步之政策，自可獲得人民之信心，肩負國家之重任。吳氏於結論時稱：因此，余切望本黨通知體會本黨在行憲後之政治中，仍負最大責任，欲求達成此神聖之任務，非羣策羣力，亟岡革新，集中意志，嚴密組織，共赴一的不可。吳氏最後強調稱：在此戡亂時期，難關重重，能否克服，端視本黨能否發揮整個力量，同志報國，此正其時，果能犧牲小完成大我，則時局雖艱，責任雖　，余深信吾人必能完成戡亂建國之使命。</p>

<h3 id="c15">從中美換文說到美援的運用 <a href="#c15" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e15" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">15</a></h3>
<p>美國援華法案於四月二日國會通過後，即由杜魯門總統簽署交國務院實施，援華總額爲四億六千三百萬美元，除了一億二千五百萬美元，指定專作軍事用途而外，其餘三億三千八百萬美元，係屬經濟援助性質；因此這項美援如何運用？究底包括些什麼物資？又怎樣加以支配？這些問題，早爲中美兩國朝野所重視。四月三十日我國駐美大使顧維鈞博士與美國務卿馬歇爾互相交換文件，換文內容已於本月三日公佈，說明一切辦法，尙待訂立雙邊恊定。我國行政院四日會議，也決定設立美援運用委員會，負責妥爲管理及運用；但在雙邊協定簽訂之前，至本年七月三日爲比，仍得照去年十月廿七日所訂的中美救濟協定辦理；可知這項美援，現在已可局部實施，其實施的種類與辦法，與中美救濟協定完全相同，其援助的數額，雖沒有明文規定，但照原法案第四〇六款之規定，自不至超過金融復興局所墊付的五千萬美元。</p>
<p>按照中美救濟協定各項條款，其要點爲：（一）由美國供應若干生活基本必需品，即糧食，醫藥，已製成及未製成之衣料，肥料，殺虫劑，燃料及種子等；（二）上項物資，除免費給與外，應與中國自產或輸入之同樣物品，妥爲分配，確保各階層人民，均獲得公正平等之分量；（四）在各大都市，設法推行配給制，及物價管制制度；（五）物資出售所得之資金，除約定用途外，　用於中國之救濟及工振事業，並聲明此項計劃，應由中國指定人員，與美代表會同商定，以期迅速與適當使用。依此成例，可證現在所可使用之美援，同時亦具有兩項意義，其一爲經濟的，即抑平物價，其二爲救濟的，即供應物資。</p>
<p>所謂抑平物價，即該協定中所要求推行的物價管制制度，其辦法爲實施配給；其來源爲兩國所提供之同樣物資。這在五大市，現正逐步推行中。原定辦理四個月，至六月底截止。現美援的初步辦法，旣決定仿照辦理，即無異救濟協定的延長，是項配給制度，自可順利地再繼續延長下去。</p>
<p>中美協定，原規定：所得救濟物費，係用以支持中國改良消費，與物價管制的。它並且附帶條件，要我國提供當地所產或自國外輸入之同樣物資，共同配合起來，以期擴大效果。這就是說明：要眞正改良消費與管制物價，單靠美國的救濟物資，是不够的。因此我們又要提到政府所自產的，收購的，定購的，及接收的那些生活基本必需品，可否援照此例，予以配給，或平售，期與改良消費，管制物價的外人願望，作桴鼓之應？抗戰以來，抑平物價是政府一貫的政策，迄今金融，貿易，貸款，外匯，內匯各方面所採的諸般措施，亦似乎無一不是朝着這方向走去，這幾日來，物價的新漲風，又在蠢蠢欲動，倘使管制物價，僅限於外來的救濟物資，而把自己所已握或可掌握的物資，儘量地予以除外，定須照最高價或市價　肯脫手，或竟握住不放，坐待日後的更最高價，不知與政府所抱抑平物價，安定民生的政策是否相符？</p>
<p>至於救濟方面，中美協定　約定；物資出售所得的款項，是用作救濟及工振的。現在實施配給，其期間已經過半，而各地的難民，如此其多，兵　的災區，又如彼其廣，不知我國應行提供的救濟及工振計劃已否擬就？其內容究竟如何？這在災區，在難胞，在難胞　集的各地方當局，無日不在焦切盼望中。現在美援的第一步辦法，旣援照中美協定辦理，其物資出售所得，以及並不出售而直接免費供給的各項救濟物資，自可統盤籌劃，擴大範圍，爲各地難民，速籌出一條切實有效的生路來。我們意見，消極的救濟也好，積極的扶助也好，凡所措施，總以與難民生活直接有關爲第一要義。</p>
<p>救濟物資除了糧食，棉花，燃料，醫藥而外，原有肥料，種子，殺虫劑等類。如果工扳方面，限於範圍，無法儘量容納，不妨多擇地段，勸令開墾，以期復歸於農。現在各省荒廢土地，所在皆是，正愁壯丁缺乏，田園荒蕪，亦不必執定三門灣一處，方是開墾的理想塲所。所慮負責無人，空言推諉，則利害較疎的人，孰肯踴躍應命，以自找麻煩？所以不欲爲難民解決這嚴重問題則已，如眞欲解決這嚴重問題，則中央主管部會即應提綱挈領，把這件事担常起來。</p>

<h3 id="c38">克里姆宮不放棄共產觀念　英國決不與蘇妥協　貝文向下院報告外交局勢 <a href="#c38" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e38" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">38</a></h3>
<p>〔路透社倫敦四日電〕下院舉行兩日外交辯論之初，反對黨發言人白特勒曾痛詆蘇聯帝國主義之擴張，指出已因此在巴勒斯坦·印度·遠東及東南亞地處，尤其是在中國造成危險點。白氏鄭重警吿，不但應在西方同時亦應在中車及遠東採取決斷遠見的行動。白氏稱，「蘇聯人民具有世界性的共產統治政策，最後必將亦必　對世界任何　所　　壓力」。</p>
<p>先是貝文外相展開辯論之際，述及國際一般關係　稱，「吾人始終成覺如果祇須對蘇聯交涉而不牽涉共產主義，則解決將屬可能。阻墝協議的因素，乃爲　爲　人所將從事的任何解決，將被用以促進共產主義的目標。在克林姆宮改變其「主義態度」以前，英蘇之間極少成立眞正而持久解決辦法的機會。」</p>
<p>述及巴勒斯坦局勢時，渠云，「吾人仍未放棄於五月十五日結束委治之原來決議，吾人已接受在該日以前維持該處法律與秩序及防止侵略的責任。吾人願以軍事力量完成該一目標，並於」五月十五以後掩護我軍之撤退。吾人已使用一切力量，以阻止阿拉伯國家之侵人巴勒斯坦，吾人之態度在警告雙方，告以在五月十五日英國保持委治權的期間，決不容忍任何性質的侵　。然於五月十五日以後，吾人決不違背任何一方之志願，使用吾人的力量以執行任何方式的解決辦法。當前急務，乃射擊必須立即停止，並建立機構使明智的意見得以存在。値茲最後一刻，本人仍請覓取解決辦法者切勿放棄努力。目前尙有時期可使理智得以運用，但再渦數天則將失之過遲矣。〕</p>

<p>述及西歐聯盟時，貝文强調指出自渠上次發表關於西歐聯盟之談話以來，對於實現當時渠所規定的目標，已獲有堅定有用而有系統的進展，已堪使西歐國家肯定的成爲歡洲眞正的一部份。簽字之五國莫不犧牲狹小的本國利益，有時甚至相當重的的利益，以謀歐洲共同的福利，不因主權觀念而脫離業已着手進行的偉大切實任務。五國莫不一致欲使西歐聯盟公約成爲每一方面有效的合作工具，相信在肇始之際，已獲有完善的基礎。</p>
<p>貝文繼曰「關於軍事問題，今已可達共同審查的階段，在防務方面，吾人未具絲毫侵略他人的意向，西歐盟各國之安全應為負責政治家及國會當前亟務，此舉決不致引起戰爭。反之，西方國家之分裂各聽其賡續存在，不免使西歐國家無以自衛。吾等之自由及生存以及西歐國家在世界地位之維持，必須爲賡續組織及注視之目標。吾人始終仍盼他國得以參加西歐聯盟，以絕對平等之條件互相合作」。</p>
<p>貝文繼述及西方國家最近與蘇聯在柏林發生之爭執，力言「吾人之在柏林乃權利所在，吾人具有繼續留在柏林的決心，余相信欲以神經戰解決此一問題的企圖終必結束，而能代以開誠佈公的談判。吾人仍主張德國統一原則，但吾人亦不得不面臨事實，承認目前尙無完成統一德國目標的可能，然吾人並未放棄未來的希望，吾人將盡力恢復德國合理而健全的生活標準，包括經濟及政治上的生活。德國之不統一，有碍其本國及鄰邦之發展。」</p>
<p>關於義大利問題，貝文承認在義大利戰後所將担任的任務得以明朗以前，尙有許多阻碍須待克服。英國認爲特里埃斯特應該歸還義大利，該地如能歸還居住該處之義大利人民，則相信該處可有公允而足以確立和平及安定的疆界。」</p>
<p>貝文最後日「就目前象徵說，世界各地今年可望豐收，果爾則糧食供應之增加，未始不爲恢復世界和平及正常條件的助力，希望世界物價能普遍下游，使歐洲復興方案，得以充分發生其效力。然美國之援助仍不能使吾人鬆懈任何方面的努力，外交上不論有可成就，工廠農礦仍能對世界和平作同等的貢獻，故生產努力仍不應稍見懈怠。」</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕舊金山五日廣播：美衆院外委會開始討論改組聯合國機構問題，罵歇爾出席陳述意見，反對任何未經蘇聯同意而改組聯合國之計劃。罵歇爾稱，『我人必須使蘇聯領袖相信蘇聯確可與其他各國「和平相處」。我人若未得蘇聯同意而遽行改組聯合國，則此一機構將被摧毀，而形成對立之軍事同盟。我人目前所需要者，並非新的和平機構，而爲更為善用業已存在之機構。」</p>

<p>〔路透社倫敦五日電〕此間今日宣布，英美蘇法四國業已同意於本月內在貝爾格勒舉行四強會議，討論多瑙河之國際航運權之管制問題。與會代表將爲高級水準之官員，議項將包括戰後之整個多瑙河問題。奧國及南斯拉夫代表觀察員身份列席。按多瑙河問題，歷史上素爲歐洲最剌手問題之一，蘇聯堅決認爲多瑙河之國際自由通航，與近代之主權觀念不能並立。西方國家則力主恢復戰前之國際自由通航地位。</p>
<p>一般認爲四强在貝爾格勒開會討論此事，實爲西方國家讓步之表示。西方國家殆已承認完全准許在多瑙河自由通航巳非當前局勢所准許，蘇聯如亦能作若干讓步，則棘手的多瑙河問題即不難解決。</p>
<p>〔路透社倫敦五日電〕根據外長會議之決議，多瑙河未來管制問題之國際會議，應於對匈羅保和約生效後六個目後即五月十五日召開。彼時外長會議決定在和約中勿規定多瑙河問題，而留待和約生效後六個月後之國際會議討論。本年三月中旬美國建議將此會延至本年後年年舉行，英國亦已同意，然英國今已接受莫斯科之建議，在不久的將來召開貝爾格勒會議，然英國並建議先在華盛頓舉行初步討論，以決定貝爾格勒會議之程序，蘇聯對此議尙未表示意見。一九四六年外長會議之決議規定由多瑙河盆地諸國，即蘇聯·烏克蘭·保·羅·南·捷·匈會同外長會之其他三强英美法舉行貝爾格勒會議，外長會並決定彼時對奧條約如已諦結，應許奧國以觀察員身份列席。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕本市參議會，前以公用事業屢屢調整價格，刺激一般物價，影響民生至鉅，曾於大會及小組會議中鄭重提出討論，建議中央穩定辦法，但迄無音訊，而最近又據報載煤價較前月配價增高百分之四十五，本市各項公用事業亦以煤價上漲，又將採用自動調整公式，被迫重行調整。故該會深感焦慮，特於昨日急電全經會，痛陳利害，並建議辦法兩點，原文如下：</p>
<p>南京全國經濟委員會勛鑒，近傳本市煤價，已由中央核定，提高百分之四十五，自五月一日起實施，惟煤價爲各稱公用事業成本中之主要部份，則各種公用事業價格，勢必因以提高。查公用事業領導一般物價上漲之事實，在本市，在各地，過去已屢見不鮮。邇近月餘，本市一般物價甫趨平穩，假若公用事業價格復經調整，又將刺激物價，掀起一般漲風，事態所在，良非危言聳聽。竊按本會前以穩定公用事業價格，乃爲抑平一般物價上漲之前提，而一般物價之上漲，反復亦影響公用事業之成本，尤以煤價及外匯爲然。遂於第五次大會以臨五字第一號決議案，擬訂辦法，面請上海市政府轉陳中央在案。而今月餘，杳無音訊，深感遺憾。茲以公用事業價格一事，直接間接，影響國計民生，倘任其翎導一般物價，則循環往復，此漲彼增，經濟崩潰，豈能倖免。本會目擊危機，痛感切膚，爰於貴會即將集會研討本案之際，不揣煩凟，再將本會意見肅電奉達：（一）對於公用事業及交通事業，立即停止適用自動調整公式，自五月份起，不使再有漲價情事，倘成本不敷，仍請中央恢復貼補制度。（二）倘貼補制度一時實施困難，則對於各該事業所必需之材料及燃料（如煤·柴油·及汽油），請政府以四月份之價格，預配三個月或預結三個月之外匯。以上兩端與中央旣定政策深相吻合，而各該事業之漲價因索，復可消弭，尙祈貴會迅賜抉擇，採納實施爲幸。上海市參議會叩·辰·微印。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕第七屆全國運動會昨日下午三時於萬衆歡騰中在市立體育塲隆重舉行開幕典禮。江灣道上，整日車輛絡繹不絕，觀衆如潮湧至。會塲四週看台上，萬頭攢動，座無隙地。不少觀衆於淸晨起，即携帶乾糧茶水預先佔定座位，後至者幾無立足之地，估計會塲觀衆約在十萬人以上。運動塲圍牆上鮮紅之國旗與白色會旗隨風飄揚。會塲內外之各色旗與服裝爭妍鬥艷，匯合成一片彩色之海，如波漣起伏，蔚爲壯觀。時犬朗氣淸，淡陽普照，更爲大會生色不少。　主席團設於西司令台，自下午二起，各界首長及外籍貴賓陸續蒞臨。二時四十九分，京滬火炬接力長跑到達終點，交大學生選手六十六人高擎火炬十一枝自東司今台大門進入運動塲，四座歡聲雷動，歷久不衰。火炬隊員越過遲動塲直趨西司令台，分庄兩旁梯級上登於主席台前，由接　最後一棒之學生王南村持元首訓詞遞交吳市長，各隊員繼即步登總理遺像及國旗之前，將火炬安插於預置之木架中而退，此一慕偉大之京滬長距離火炬接跑，於焉完成。熊熊火焰高燃於總理遺像前，充份顯示我中華男兒健勇之精神。</p>
<p>鐘鳴三下，各地選手在軍樂聲中列隊魚　進塲，繞行一週。行列由軍樂隊前導。最前爲大會會旗，依次貴州隊、印尼隊，靑島隊，甘肅隊，安徽隊，山東隊，陸軍隊，臺灣隊，福建隊，江西隊，山西隊，漢口隊，空軍隊，浙江隊，菲律賓隊，南京隊，天津隊，江蘇隊，四川隊，重慶隊，陝西隊，河北隊，遼寗隊，安東隊，遼北隊，吉林隊，松江隊，合江隊，黑龍江隊，嫩江隊，興安隊，哈爾濱隊，瀋陽隊，警察隊，湖南隊，北平隊，西安隊，馬華隊，聯勤隊，西貢隊，香港隊，湖北隊，熱河隊，河南隊，廣西隊，海軍隊，廣東滕，廣州隊，檀香山隊，新疆隊，暹羅隊，西康隊，最後爲上海隊，共計五十三隊，選手二千餘人，莫不精神抖擻，英姿勃勃，在服裝方面更是整齊美觀。如海陸空軍之制服，印尼隊之全身火紅，合灣隊之純白，東北代表之黃卡嘰，湖北男選手之綠白相間。五彩續紛，各有特點。塲內掌聲，此起彼落，於東北代表華僑代表及新疆代表所過之處，觀衆更報以熱烈之歡呼。全體選手於繞行完畢後，即在場中分列縱隊，面向西司令台而立。</p>
<p>三時卅七分，儀式開始，奏樂行禮後，首先由南開大學校長張伯苓恭讀元首訓詞（全文見昨日本報），繼由大會正會長朱家驊及副會長吳國楨相繼致詞，（見後）及選手代表宣誓，最後，全體高呼口號：「全國運動會萬歲！蔣主席萬歲！中華民國萬歲萬歲萬萬歲」！時會場上空有本報飛機一架及其他飛機三架散發傳單，一時紅綠繽紛，歡聲四起。塲內更有本報放飛信鴿千頭，羣翼過處，觀衆報以陣陣掌聲。整個大會情緒可謂興奮熱烈，惜原定節目中之空軍跳傘表演，因高空風勢峭勁而臨時宣吿中止舉行，甚爲美中不足。</p>
<h3 id="c79">團體大會操　表現合作之美　舞手時如海鷗齊飛低首時如羊羣覓食 <a href="#c79" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e79" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">79</a></h3>
<p>儀式完畢後，即舉行六千人團體大會操，參加者五十二校，分八十八組，排成整齊之縱滕，由大會裁判張覺非總指揮，在市立兒童敎養所兒童樂隊陪奏之下表演整齊壯麗之柔軟操。所有參加表演之男女生，一律穿白上衣藍短袴白鞋，當行列前進之時，恍似一張蔚藍大海中白浪滾滾，觀衆睹此美麗之畫面，已贊不絕口，迨會操開始後，節奏諧和，進退有序，舞手時如海鷗羣飛，低頭時如羊羣覓食。靑春之旋律及大團體合作之美，於此表現無遺，觀衆之掌聲乃不絕於耳，至四時三刻表演完畢，全運會之開幕典禮，至此乃圓滿結束。</p>

<p>敎育部長朱家驊在大會開幕禮中致詞稱：「第七屆全國運動會原定在民國廿六年召開，因抗戰軍興而中止。現抗戰勝利，今日能在上海開幕，內心極爲愉快。本屆大會之陣容勝於以往各屆，如脫離祖國十五年之台灣及爲男族侵凌十四年之東北於今均有代表到來，海外各單位亦較以前爲多，警察及軍隊等更能自成單位，凡此均足增加大會之特色。吾國古時敎育向來注重文武合一，近代以來因對體育不加注意，故而國民身體衰弱，國家多難。自國民政府成立以來，即儘力提倡體育，以求民强國泰。體育家之精神須在和諧中爭取勝利，勝固不驕，敗亦勿餒，尤其應注重合作，不計個人的成敗而顧全全體的光榮。現十四屆世界運動會不久將在敦舉倫行，希望此次大會能有良好成績表現，俾我國選手亦能與世界各國一爭短長。更望以合作精神相互切磋，並將此種精神推廣及於民間，以轉移社會風氣，復興民族國家，最後並祝各位選手努力，康健成功。」</p>

<p>吳市長致詞稱：「第七屆全國運動會在上海召開，極感光榮，惟因限於經費環境及時間侷促，致招待不週，甚爲慚愧，惟在今日內亂未平，國力凋蔽之際，全國運動會能如期召開，已是最大奇蹟。第一應感謝全國人民之熟心協助，相信我中華民國必有繁榮前途。第二感謝各地體育界熱心人士，第三感謝大會郝總幹事之努力，使大會能順利召開，最後希望各位選手對招待不週之處加以原諒。」</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕京滬火炬接力長跑、昨爲最後一日。第七隊隊員十四人，担任太倉至眞如間四十二公里之跑程。晨七時廿二分，楊大均高擎火炬，自太倉首先出發，事前太倉各界羣集車站歡送，臨時推定郁寶瑞，王瑞英，二小姐獻「積健爲雄」錦旗一面，由王鐵生代表接受，並還贈火炬一只，以留紀念。出發後第七隊全體陪楊略跑一程，嗣即依次接遞，太倉騎警隊隨後護送。時日麗風和，路旁麥穗累累，鄉民均三五成羣，竚看健兒，隊員等在興奮之歡呼聲中，健步如飛。七時五十八分，第三棒趙國萍即抵嘉定縣境葛隆鎭。</p>
<p>嘉定縣長周明星，暨警局長胡錦文，各鄉鎭長，自衛團等，在選手經過嘉定縣境前後，始終伴隨不離。先在葛隆迎候，繼又趕赴滬嘉交界之胡家木橋送別。選手於八時十三分過外岡鎭，八時四十三分抵嘉定西門，途中民衆均自動集隊歡迎，行列長達數里。嘉縣練西國民小學女生唐大冷代表該校獻花，縣中女生楊大瑤代表黎明體育會獻「自强不息」錦旗，王彩霞小姐復代表該隊獻花，嘉定周縣長亦贈「大道薪傳」錦旗一面，由金大吉，趙碧蘭，二小姐代獻，情緒熱烈，掌聲響徹雲霄。</p>
<p>九時四十分，喬楓大踏步跑抵南翔，翔公公校，中心國民學校，懷少敎育院，大德小學等學生及民衆千餘人，均列隊歡迎。懷少獻「速於置郵而傳命」橫額一方，大德王金鳳孫秀娟二小姐代表該校獻花籃一只，歡呼聲此起彼落，盛况空前。</p>
<p>進入市區　觀者如堵</p>
<p>十時十八分，第七隊最後一棒沈被章跑進上海市區後，該隊全體俱加入陪跑。十時卅五分到達眞如。公路總局築路機械管訓處，事先已備妥水菓等慰勞物品，當即分發。正午並招待七八兩隊隊員午餐。同時該局在全體隊員休息時間內，特派員測算由眞如至會塲之正確路綫及距離。結果確定全程爲二〇公里，分由十人接跑，每人二千公尺需跑十分鐘，故決於下午一時半後啓程。</p>
<p>嗣又經商討，認爲沿途交通情形未盡完善，恐預算時間無法保持，乃臨時提前於一時正出發。附近居民得悉此段已爲全程最後一段，且傳大會儀式亦正待選手跑達後揭開，一時傾巷追隨，脚踏車行列竟達二百部以上。</p>
<p>以逸待勞　邁步入塲</p>
<p>第八隊由劉振中居首，依次傳遞，人潮汹湧中，開路車，指揮車，護送車，隨行車，記者車更分列兩排緩緩前進，浩浩蕩蕩，引得鐵路兩側，萬頭攢動，鼓噪歡呼。行列經虬江路，四川北路，吳淞路口，九龍路，嘉興路橋，直趨其美路，沿路駐足而觀者不下數萬人，選手等在爆竹聲中，興奮奔馳，步伐極速，抵遠五角塲時猶二時未到，因距開會時間尙早，全體祇得鵠立路旁靜候。</p>
<p>鐘鳴三時，接力跑隊六十六人，分成兩排，前十一人各執火炬，由王南村前導，在數萬觀衆期待下，循東司令台大門進入會塲，登西司令臺向大會主席恭呈元首訓詞，時樂聲悠揚，氣象肅穆，此一象徵全運精神之歷史任務，遂於一片掌聲中宣吿完成。</p>

<h3 id="c95">足球戰揭開序幕　浙江勝菲律賓　在延長時間內連中三元　空軍以五對一輕取漢口 <a href="#c95" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e95" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">95</a></h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕全運會開幕典禮雖於昨日下午三時在萬目睽睽之下熟烈舉行，但眞正的序幕，則早於上午在逸園及滬江大學之足球塲上展開。</p>
<p>逸園有空軍對漢口，和浙江對菲律賓兩場。第一塲空軍漢口兩隊經騐稍差，惟空軍經名將戴麟經訓導，聯絡較勝一籌，結果以五對一勝。第二塲雙方球藝勢均力敵，菲律賓先威後衰，球門柯騰經表演精彩，浙江終以六對三反敗爲勝。</p>
<p>空軍與漢口之戰</p>
<p>第一塲九時正開始。選擇塲地，空軍面光而戰，十分鐘時，空軍麥潤明傳中，梁廣鎭輕輕撥入漢隊網底，首開紀錄。此後你來我往，雙方大吃螺。廿五分鐘時，空軍麥潤明開角球，人叢裏忽然警笛長鳴，漢隊有人以手吻球，空軍　容發主罰十二碼球，一脚入網，成二比〇，五分鐘後，空軍梁廣鎭得田容發幾次妙遞，連續搗入兩球。上半塲終了，紀錄牌上空軍赫然以四對〇佔先。</p>
<p>下半塲，漢守門譚漢成替出葉濤。交接後，空軍傾師來犯，冷不防一球從人叢中射來，譚漢成從容接住阿斗。惟漢隊陣地前，危機重重。十五分鐘時，空軍前鋒綫幾個淸晰的短遞，球又入漢隊腹地。藍寳田一腿飛起，球就應聲入網，成五對〇。此後漢隊雖不時有機會叩空軍之門，可惜聯絡不佳，幾次都是半途而廢，功敗垂成。臨終前五分鐘，球在空軍門前盤桓，漢陳子修一脚，把球踢中劉　麟的上腿，彈進了空軍的門角，紀錄牌上成五對一，漢口倖免吃鴨蛋。</p>

<p>第二塲十時半開始，菲隊擇地，浙江開球。兩隊送往迎來，客客氣氣，幾下長踢短遞，脚頭淸脆殺辣，第一塲時的拖泥帶水，一掃而光。十五分鐘內，浙江三次凶險的叩門，都經菲隊柯騰經一一救出。菲隊不甘示弱，林羅挽統率三軍進犯，陳珠君傳來恰到好處，施並杉舉脚猛叩，球直竄浙隊網底。可是禍不單行，菲隊　先勝一球之餘威，再番蹂躪浙陣地，前鋒綫高速度派司，施並杉被監視不放，一球挑送林羅挽，林不負使命，又進一球，成二對〇。是時浙隊右後衛費春林人香徐晟源。卅分鐘時，浙隊吳炳浩，還以顏色，遠處吊中，球從左上角進門，柯騰　徒呼奈何。騰經受過此番敎訓，着着提防球的來勢，留心站立的位置，果然，肅子文幾次吊斜角球，騰經都從容躍起救出，一一化險爲夷。上半場將終了時，菲隊林羅挽連　，球出急如平射砲，　雄接　　　，成菲三浙一。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕大連足球隊昨天以勇猛的姿態擊退了聯勤，結果是二比零。如果大連的前鋒能够在門前的一脚，不太軟弱的話，那末至少可以贏半打以上的紀錄。　在七十分鐘的混戰中，雖然雙方得球的紀錄，一共祗有兩隻，但是局勢幾乎成了一面倒。聯勤因爲實力比較單薄，始終處在被壓迫的地位。</p>
<p>比賽是在大運動塲內舉行，秩序顯得相當凌亂，到後來觀衆幾乎全部進了塲。</p>
<p>五時半，比賽開始，先由大連開球，一開頭，大連即傾師進攻，聯動門前險象環生。但是大連前鋒因了門前的一脚，不是失之過高，即是脚頭遲鈍無力，屢屢失之交臂。聯勤的門守，在驚風駭浪中，頻頻搶救，着實煞費苦心。三十五分鐘的混戰，上半時各無建樹。</p>
<p>易地再戰，大連攻勢仍盛。接觸五分鋒後，左路包抄進攻，吊球門前，閻承寬自人叢中乘隙一蹴，慢慢滾入網內，首先打開紀錄。此後大遇仍有數度佳機，但均越木而出。</p>
<p>逾六分鐘，大迎獲得罰角球機會，蔣本深開來恰到妙處，門守躍身迎接未着，陳朝福適時趕到，一碰而入，成二比零。</p>
<p>此後，聯勤雖一度進攻，但未得逞，如是苦戰良久，時間告終，大連將於七日遭遇廣東。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕昨晨在滬江大學的兩塲足球初賽，一是陸軍對靑島，陸軍以一對零勝靑島；一是廣東對河南，河南實力太差凈吃四只鴨蛋。</p>
<p>陸靑之戰</p>
<p>陸軍對靑島之戰於九時零五分開始，陸軍張金海未出，由瞿永福掛中鋒印，遺缺則由張仁義塡補。靑島方面，門將楊永森僅在塲邊觀戰，中堅劉文學權作司閣。裁判銀笛一聲，吹開戰幕，陸軍先攻，鋒綫盤弄過多，良機每失諸交臂。五分鐘，高秀淸於十二碼處試射，被劉文學救出。靑島反攻，張吉良，盛德新，連袂直入，亦受阻於吳祺祥。混戰良久，陸軍攻勢雖盛，母如前鋒旣少射門人才，盤傳之間，又多拖泥帶水，加以靑島守將，能奔能拼，有苗祺昌之苦　，有楊昌之爽辣。陸軍將士，遂有「老鼠拉龜，無從下手」之苦。上半時於混戰中結束，兩無建樹。</p>
<p>再戰聲起，靑島以原陣應戰，越六分鐘，陸軍顧以撒登塲，張仁義下野，瞿永福退居前衛，高秀淸改任中鋒，鋒綫調整後，攻勢更盛。惟戰歷廿八分後，兩軍在靑島門前混戰，陸軍得角球機會，由費春華主踢，瞿永福覷個正着，頂人左角，奠定勝基。此後靑島雖圖反攻，陸軍二吳一孟，坐鎭後防，固若金湯。終塲遂以一比〇淘汰靑島。</p>

<p>廣東與河南之戰，繼之登場，「觸雷」代表在侯澄滔率領下，先取攻勢。河南隊實力較差，祗有招架之力。上半時廣東隊凈勝三球（一）馬賢得羣侯澄滔呼應，挑過柴居振，閃過關新友，右脚低射入網，淸晣美觀。（二）馬羣賢得陳榕之高傳不待球落，抽腿猛叩，砰然破網。（三）上半塲臨終前五分鐘，劉學鎡於十五碼得機，低射中的。</p>
<p>易邊再戰，廣東秉承餘威，圍攻不已。五分鐘時，劉學鎡於近門處挑入右角，王天澤手足並用，檔而復漏，球已滾過白綫，張濟民急急鈎出，裁判未見，倖免於難。十五分時，林啓泉左陲吊中，侯澄滔一盤一搭，挑人左角，成四比〇，此後廣東仍控制全塲，惟所獲已多，不爲已甚，迨終塲聲起，遂以四球凈勝。</p>

<p>— 本報記者　胡降昶</p>
<p>〔本報特寫〕田徑賽在國內荒蕪了十餘年，這次在七屆全運揭幕的前夕，漫談田賽大勢，揣測錦標誰屬，祗可說是一種胆大的嘗試。</p>
<p>如說，十七年來，田賽老將有的　國　　了，　符保　，華遂安等，　的　故，像陳　球等，有的　隱了，有的居然　　　　田賽沙塲。下過，　　　　　估　大多數。這些田賽　　　　　的特　，要說給我們一些影　　的話、那　　　各地　　　來的　　成績了。</p>
<p>些成績的準確　如何？　是在怎　的氣　和　下　　的？這　　　　　？大會　　沙土和　　如何？各　　是否有　　病？……這一切的　　。在　　　　　　　眞正的成績。也　、一個塲一　的好手、因此占落　山。一個　　　　　　、　得心　　、創造了一個　　。</p>
<p>何况，略一　　各地預選的成績、田賽裏男子有擊破全國紀錄的項目並不多。這一來，幾個實力伯仲的隊伍，男的像台灣，福建，上海，海·陸·空軍等隊伍，似乎每隊都是頭黑馬，大家都有可能搶個先。</p>
<p>男子</p>
<p>臺灣不難問鼎錦標</p>
<p>先說男子田賽，光復後的台灣，挾優異的雙跳（跳遠三級跳）和三　紀錄，傾師來犯。而且每項都有實力　　　　　　四位參加與賽，間　　標、　　　　　事。但空軍的三　　　　　　也下　、海軍的沿球標　　　　　，當然是臺灣的勁敵。—　隊　　　　平平、下　　人　　。成績平衡、如果能　爭些各項目的　四把交椅、　　的德分，也是　　可觀的。</p>
<p>下　、我還是　　　於台灣健兒的雙　和—跳遠和三級跳。台田徑宿將張　賢曾有跳遠七米二八·三級跳十四米四九的成績。現在雖已老去，仍望老當益壯，爲祖國創造個奇蹟。</p>
<p>馬華李芬的跳遠，一度曾創七米〇六的優異紀錄。聯勤王士林的六米六九，台灣張立人的六米六四，河北崔振聲的六米五三，以及汀蘇老將張嘉　等，成績均可一拼。三級跳方而，空軍黃健的十四米，閩徐鳳山的十三米四〇，也還不弱。</p>
<p>標槍可望創紀錄</p>
<p>其次，要看海軍王學武的標搶了。此公在六屆全運時，鬱鬱不得志；最近成績，聽說到過五五米二，已打破周長星的五三米八五的全國紀錄、此次願王君好自爲之，一　上　沉電。此外陸軍陳濟川的四九米九二，台　天　的四八米九，都是得分的記錄。</p>
<p>糾球，鐵餅，跳高，和　竿跳四項，恐怕不會有驚人的成績出現。　　項已知的優異記錄看看，鉛球有　齊沛霖的十二米九五，他的鐵餅也有　四一米四的成績。空軍王瑞的卅九米也不高。跳高似以陸軍劉夢九的一米八三爲最强。撑竿跳一項，各地成績均不値一提。難道符王（保鷹）之後，眞不作第二人想麼？</p>
<p>女子</p>
<p>福建實力最為雄厚</p>
<p>縱眼看本屆女田賽，要比男田賽够勁了。樂觀些說，各項紀錄都有刷新的可能。總錦標當以福建隊呼聲爲最高。該隊隊員共十人，大多是蒲田中學年事正靑的學生，殺撲，結實，運動姿勢，全部男性型。看了她們去年遠征京滬時所向披靡的成績，就知道我預測根據之所在。</p>
<p>再論各項紀錄擊破的可能性：依次先說跳高，北平吳樹森在選拔賽中，一躍而過一米三六五。朱天眞的一米三五五全國紀錄，粉碎無遺。吳小姐這次對跳高冠軍，當可穩得。上海陳　振的一米三四，亦已接近全國。可惜的是濟南　玫琳，有一米四〇的優　記錄，竟因故而不能參加。</p>
<p>跳遠一項，閩陳碧英有五米〇三的成績，與　銀　的五米〇六全國記錄·僅差·〇三米。陳小姐體力充沛，如情况正常，不　刷新記錄。此外，靑陳端年的四米六八，合張甘妹的四米六一，閩吳淑英的四米五五，都是佳作。</p>
<p>北平三鐵新慧星</p>
<p>本屆女田賽中最値得慶幸的，就是北平發現了一顆鐵球鐵餅的新慧星——王燦華。王小姐粗壯如男子，振臂一擲，鉛封得十米八七，鐵餅得卅三米三七。兩項都打破了陳榮棠保持十多年的紀錄。這次她無疑將囊括雙鐵冠軍。</p>
<p>上屆全運女三鐵冠軍陳榮棠，此番東山再起，代表印尼出席。雖說陳年事老去，身體發胖，不過三鐵擲手，貴在體重穩健。陳小姐最近成績雖朱正式測騐，不過實力依然未可小視。在女三鐵中，依然可爭二三把交椅。</p>
<p>比外，北平冼少梅的鉛球，也有十米以外的實力。鐵餅成績也出州米，在旁虎視耽耽。合張瑞妍雙　成績也不弱。可以得分。標槍方面，王　華想以保持鐵球鐵餅實力關係，未見參加，那末，將看平冼少梅，台李淑德，即陳榮　等　　一番了。</p>
<p>但福建隊　隊員成績平均，得分機會多，總分第一希望，當然最濃厚。</p>
<p>以上不過是些管　蠡　，像本文開頭時所我的，任何一個意外的因素，　是推　原有的預測。不過，假定一切正常的話，我相信，這些揣測，雖不中，亦不　矣。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕昨日七屆全運會開幕，本報記者特請王正廷博士對仝運發表感想。渠稱：（一）全運會已有十二年未舉行了，今日能如期隆重開幕，乃可吿慰國民。（二）木屆全運，因經費不足，籌備時間如此偏促，能有五十二單位參加，國人如此熱烈興奮，乃中央政府，上海市政府，尤其是吳市長的出力，本人非常感佩。（三）今天　人看到復　祖國的台灣同胞，久淪敵寇之手的東北同胞，邊疆各省如新疆西康等同胞，以及海外僑胞，紛紛來歸，覺得異常興奮。（四）本人希望國家早日太平，下一次全運，能有充分的時間，經費、辦得比這一次更好。</p>
<p>記者繼又往訪張伯苓先生，渠發表其感想如下：此次全運會，在如此環境下，經費又缺乏，竟能準時開幕，洵非易事，其意義異常重大。此次全運會在全國性的國民大會後，選舉總統，實行新憲快後舉行，國人素來文弱，運動能敎我們競爭，別的競爭在「權」，在「利」，而運動會在爭「名」，另一方面來說：遝動會的競爭是有規則的競爭，任何比賽都要不犯規，人人守法，今夭的大會便是建立民主國家，敎人民如何守法的一種具體表現。（暢）</p>
<h3 id="c103">中國全運村　有人想發運動財 <a href="#c103" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e103" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">103</a></h3>
<p>〔本報特寫〕大會會塲內每一處塲子裏，正陸續展開着磨拳擦掌你爭我奪的肉搏鏡頭，但你可曾在塲外溜過一個圈子？你看到的那些臨時的商店，食府，吿訴你；這一個個和堡壘沒有二樣，他們勾心鬥角，出奇制勝的一股勁兒，比起塲子裏有過之無不及，甚至還要精彩哩。如果說這一帶的蘆蓆棚就是變相的「奧林匹克村」的話，就名之爲「中國全運村」吧。這一個村落，圍着東司令台的後牆，成了個「丫」字形，飲食店大部分佈在兩條岔路上，有冷飲，有小吃，比較冷飲店的佈置富麗一點，究　一隻紅的可口可樂冰箱或是美女牌的黃冰箱，在派頭上就着了先　，不像幾隻汽汕桶砌上了石灰的臨時爐灶，先就破壞了門面的美觀，不過胃口各有不同，「翡翠谷」裏固然有客在飲，可是「老松誠」裏照樣排骨雙澆，也喊得響亮。</p>
<p>開張的已在招攬顧客，冷飲店忙着雇了二百四十萬元一次的卡車不斷充實力量，頂一個門面雖只要三四千萬元，可是裏面堆的東西價値要超過十倍以上，老闆們多估計有對本對利的賺頭，但願老天讓他們發個「運動財」。</p>
<p>在直路上，是精神食糧的倉庫，是一條文化街，三十多萬一塊的三夾板，近兩萬元一尺的杉木，還有足以開爿小油漆店的色漆，加上二元五角照生活指數計算的人工，把這條街點綴得可眞美輪美奐，誰會知道是「油漆其外，蘆蓆其中」？各有各的美，各有各的妙，像本報對門而居的兩間門面，可以實惠地吿訴你溫度，使你吃冰或者加衣有一個依據，再吿訴你時間，趕着精彩的不會錯失。</p>
<p>這裏還有尖銳化的廣吿戰，立在運動塲外圍的廣吿牌，一高一低像城牆一樣，有香烟，報紙，藥品，鞋襪，銀行，還有電影的特寫鏡頭，八十尺一方，要二億四千萬元，據說廣吿公司除掉成本，將全部　給會裏，這一　宜外收入，眞眞可觀，又據說一家香烟廠要在記錄板上端豎一隻香烟罐，但爲廣吿公司拒絕，說是影響分布在兩旁的戶頭。比較出人頭地的廣吿，是回力球社和可口可樂，一以大刀闊斧勝，一則綴些橫條小廣吿在籃球塲，體育館，游泳池的四周，他們中間大多抱着這樣一個觀念，不求賺錢，但願做出牌子，善哉，善哉！</p>
<p>再轉到大門附近，一家臨時食堂裏已堆了四隻鵝，一匹猪，滿箱的黃魚，夥計已經在忙着刮魚麟，一簍子的老筍頭，據說要留着　湯，在北面還有一爿藏在樹後的店家，門口貼着張原有的卡片式的招牌：「上海市招待慰勞戡亂將士委員會老虎灶，」現在也賣水，賣煤，吃餐，喝水的朋友，這兩處是可以向你們介紹的便宜去處。</p>
<p>冷落了多年的遝動塲外圍馬路，現在也顯得「鬧猛」了，一家麵店老抑娘吿訴我臘：抽沒有鈔票到塲子裏撑門面，只好就原來的裝修裝修，可是一動手就化費了五千多萬，這些人，才眞是將本求利之輩，他們只希望不得其門而入的觀衆，照顧他們一點。</p>
<p>警察局破天荒做起廣吿牌：「迷途，失竊，急救，速向警局服務處報吿。」但願這塊牌子僅是給人看看的，千萬可不能同有生意眼的玩意兒一視同仁。（育）</p>

<p>〔本報特寫〕昨天的全運會中，只有用一個「擠」字來形容，才較妥切，而且不僅是擠，而且在「擠」的程度以上。擠，推，衝原是三舟曲，於是有人跌傷，有人流血，有人斷臂，有入昏迷，要有人哭爹喚娘，擠丟了鞋子，那更不算是一回事了。</p>
<p>在大會三時開幕以前，已經先後有十四個人扛到童子軍救護隊中急救。全部受傷觀衆，有紀錄可查的，達三十二人，其中七人傷勢較重，並有三人送往醫院療治。</p>
<p>在昨天下午二時半，東司令台右側的看台，突然有一處欄杆折斷，連跌下帶跳下的觀衆，共有二百多人。第一個摔下來的，是培英小學的一個五年級學生，名字叫華靑中（又名鑑忠）。這位小朋友只有十四歲，受不了後面人羣的擠，推，衝，前面的欄杆又不牢靠，於是就隨着斷裂的欄杆摔下來。脚部受傷，稍加急救後，就送到魏德邁路警察醫院去。還有一位賈雲生，把右前臂都跌斷了，急救的看護們，用綁帶替他把右臂包紮弔起後，魷將他送到市立醫院去。另有一位王寅，左腿挫傷，送往警察醫院。此外，跌傷腰部，腿部，臂部的，有戴傳良，彭激，姜味靑，王東方，王林森，田家農，王浣琴，高貿淸等十多人。其中有四五位，都是小學中的小朋友，幸而傷勢無大碍。</p>
<p>不多一會兒，西司令台左側，也有一處欄杆折斷。北看台也有一處欄杆斷裂。雖然各有五六十人衝下來，僅有一個小女孩吳英梅，因腦部震傷，有點昏迷，但經過急救，隔了些時，就好了。</p>
<p>出事三次以後，看台上的人們，都具戒心，沒再出意外。可是到了三時廿五分，吳市長正在西司令合上致詞時，突有大批人羣，從合下的門口衝進來，秩序一時大亂，維持秩序的軍警無法阻擋。魷在這種混亂情形下，有好多人給擠倒了，尤其是婦女和小朋友們。好幾位太太軋破絲襪，大腿上淌着一灘灘的血。</p>
<p>結果，大部份衝進來的人，都又給軍警們請出去了，有少數人，倖免被逐。記者問他們，爲甚麼要這樣衝？他們答說，都買了票子，但沒有方法走進有台，只有朝大門內衝，並說外面有兩千多有票子的人進不來。</p>
<p>這些票子想衝進　內的觀衆，和維持秩序的軍警相持了半個多鐘頭的樣子，到了四點鐘，都放他　進來了。因爲這些人，都是花了五萬或二十萬法幣，買了票子，却無　進入看台，由於看台早已軋足，再也不能容納他們了。</p>
<p>據負責警衛和救護的童子軍說，欄杆都不結實，一擠就斷了，而且走道上破碎彈片很多，跌下更易受傷，他們就檢到三十多只廢彈。至於有了票子而進不來的人，這也不該由買票子的人負責吧？</p>
<p>假使沒有上面兩種意外情形，昨天大會的秩序可以好許多。因爲當局派出大批軍警維持秩序，佈置頗周到，角角落落都有人。警察局派出一百五十名飛行堡壘隊員，三個中隊的保安警察，四十四名少年警察，偵緝科全體出動，還加上女警，和維持塲外秩序的交通大隊。憲兵方面派了一個警備連。警備大隊也出動不少人員，另外還有一百名童子軍。</p>
<p>關於塲內救護，昨天大會塲內有五個救護隊，由七十四位童子軍和醫藥護士人員負責。他們都盡了最大的方，但因爲「亂子」太多，所以顯得力量單薄。照這樣下去，可能再需要兩三個救護隊。</p>
<p>此外，義勇消防隊，共有九個單位參加，出動七部車輛，和六十名消防員，參加救護工作。（剛）</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕全運會當局鑒於維持大會秩序問題之市要，及昨日開幕典禮舉行時，一部份觀衆甚爲紊亂，一小部份大看台，因觀衆過於擁擠，竟將水泥欄杆推斷，昨晚有關各組警衛交通塲地票務等組長，舉行聯席會議，商討改善辦法。經縝密商討，決定：加强警衛力量，劃定警戒區域，增加大看合出入口，並決定趕製鐵絲網架二十具，安置各重要出入口處，如時間許可，今日即行使用，防止再度發生觀衆衝毀門口等事件。各組之間，應取得更密切之聯繫。</p>

<p>連日本市糧價飛漲，吳市長對此甚爲注意。昨晨十時以電話向民調會主委任顯羣詢問，並與社局吳局長聯絡，交換意見，決定處置辦法，規定自六日起，所有米·粉·油一律不得超過五日收盤價格。如有超過，將由民調會無限制在市塲供應米油及麵粉云。</p>
<p>米市漲勢昨愈演愈烈，無錫產價報漲，執貨者益居奇不售，早市及中市最見緊俏。南市塲白粳猛漲四十萬，薄稻狂跳四十五萬元，其他秈米等一致飛升四十萬元，臨收時有乘高吐出，稍見回落。北市塲白粳早稻秈米各漲三十萬，特高粳高達四百八十五萬，白粳做四百七十五萬元，白元抵五百萬大關。迄收市時亦略見回平。昨日到貨五千八百九十四石。</p>
<p>麺粉　甫開即升達限度，塲內交易極稀，塲外喊價混亂，老車及兵船均喊高達一百六十五萬元，紅蜂及建成各做過一百六十萬元。後市市微回，老車兵船各低至一百六十萬，建成紅蜂亦回低，仍較上日升六萬元左右。麩皮初擯持不開，後大包一百〇五萬有交，小麥廠盤加二十萬。</p>
<p>雜糧　漢口乍升為二百四十萬，漲十五萬元，後市略平。苞米亦扳高十餘萬，揀靑乏應市，喊高二十萬，未成交。紅糧漲十五萬，菉豆本客帮均取，上挺達三十萬之鉅。沙赤出五百萬外，軋升三十萬。芝蔴生仁在客帮之爭取下，各漲約三十萬左右。</p>

<p>— 儲玉坤</p>
<p>（The　Citizen　and　Government，by　John　A．HawgoodNicholson　&amp;　Watson，London，1947全書一百廿八頁，實價六先令。）</p>
<p>本書是愛德華先生主編的「新民主叢書」之一，他在引言中說，「人類在百年之前，爲了民主的安全，不知犧牲了幾百萬人的生命。鬥爭的結果，雖然獲得完全勝利，使民主得在世界各處指頭，但是理想幻滅了，熱情消失了。這種現象，決不可任其重演。吾人在第二次大戰中，又已獲勝，此際民主必須贏得和平。</p>
<p>「我們認爲一九一九年和平締造者爲了民主而喪失和平，其主要原因，乃在他們沒有把民主的基本原則與民主的外形搞淸楚所致。現在我們對於他們的錯誤旣已償付了重大的代價，自應設法使十九世紀的民主能與廿世紀的情形相配合。我們必須承認科學的進步，再加以「總體戰」的刺激，已造成許多新的可能及新的社會組織，爲人類社會進行革命，唯有民主能成爲一種機動的力量，運用一切新的發現及技術，使人類不再有失業的人，使社會不再有所不安有所需要，爲人類生活及自由開闢一條新的疆界，民主始能生存在這個世界上，此項任務，不能完全諉諸政治家及專家，而應由每個公民負之。民主國家的要旨，就在公民人人都能參加任務的決定」從這裏，我們也就可以看出愛德華先生主編新民主義書的宗旨了。</p>
<p>本書作者霍果特先生，是伯敏漢大學的政治歷史敎授，曾在歐美各國，專攻普通行政，對於行政的方法，研究有椉，在英國好算是一個權威了。據他在致讀者一文中說，本書原由作者與奧文先生二人合編，後因奧文先生供職聯合國機構，事忙不克兼顧，乃由作者一人編著，第四章「工業的民主」，係與「新民主叢書」主鹹愛德華先生所合編。</p>
<p>在我國政治民主化剛剛開始的時候，我覺得這一本小册子，値得介紹與讀者。因爲在目前，老百姓對於政治，依舊不甚感覺倒典趣，國大代表與立法委員，雖均由人民選舉而產生，但是人民投票並不踴躍，當選了的國大代表或立法委員，有根本不知代表爲何物，甚至有人以爲做了國大代表，就是做了大官，可以橫行無忌，我們看到國大代表揮拳毆傷國大職員，眞要替我國的民主政治担心！此外，國內還有一種現象，我們在報章雜誌上常常看到「民主民主」的呼號，但很少看到關於民主理論的檢討，我要勸吿國內政治學者，與其空口高唱民主，還不如多寫幾本關於民主的著作，尤其是通俗化的小册子多出版幾本，風行國內，好喚起一般人民的政治意識。</p>
<p>本書內容，淺顯明白，共分七章，作一簡單的介紹如下：（一）關於公民的幾個問題，說明現代民主國家的公民，應該採用各種方法，以左右國家的立法，政策的決定以及全國的行政；因此作者以肯定的語氣說，公民僅靠投票，是不足以發揮民主政治的精神的。但是作者採集了許多插圖，說明人民爭取選舉權的經過。（二）議會民主制，說明了英國議員的選舉方法，在一九四四年雖曾加以修改，但是在大體上仍與戰前無異。作者記爲英國下議院的議員有三種不同的身份：1地方代表；2全國代表；3某一界的代表。（三）地方民主政府，首先說明十九世紀的改革及廿世紀的需要。以英法德三國的地方政府爲例，認爲在組織上，均需要改革。其次說明民選參議員的地位，最後列舉榔村社會的特殊問題。</p>
<p>第四章工業民主，一開頭就說今日英國的總工會，已擁有八百萬的會員，成爲英國國內最大的勢力。內部的組織完全民主化，像政治一樣，也經過開會及投票的方式，決定工作規程及選舉執行委員；同時也有解決內部糾紛的類似司法的制度，每一個工人，對於總工會均負有責任。第六章測騐輿論，在按術上大可研究，英國在一九四〇年設有戰時社會調查會，隨時調查戰時民意的向背，此在美法兩國，也有民意研究所的組織。英國民意研究所，是私人組織的，但對於促進民主却有很大的貢獻。</p>
<p>最後一章是公民的敎育，作者認爲敎育應該普及全國，除了正式的小學·中學·大學應該散遍各地而外，其他方式的公民敎育尤應積極進行，例如書報閱覽室的創設，靑年議當的舉行，都是不可忽視的。最後作者又提出一個很大的問題就是，「公民與世界」，他認爲一個民主國家專的公民，與其外交政策的後果，也有非常密切關係，例如和平與戰爭的問題，對他不啻是個生死問題，榮辱問題，悲歡問題。所以公民敎育應該包括許多關於外國的情報及其興英國的關係，英國廣播公司雖已盡了極大的努力，但是在民主國家需要更多的國際知識。這個建議，最値得我們的注意。</p>

<p>中國通商銀行創立五十週年紀念冊　中國通商銀行編</p>
<p>三十六年四月二十五日印　二七〇頁　非賣品</p>
<p>近年以來，經濟的重要性日益顯著。而我國數十年來新事業之日起有功者，銀行業姑不論其對社會的功過，要屬首屈一指。其所倡率對經濟的研討成績，近十餘年無論專著或期刊，銀行業皆有所表現，爲治近代史者取資最便且多的唯一文獻。</p>
<p>本册亦可視為此種成績之一種。—此種紀念出以文字研討的，在國內尤値得推許。—該行爲紀念其五十週年，因發刊此册，對本行固免不了有所表彰，如第一篇社月笙君「五十年來之中國通商銀行」，與附錄「五十年來之中國財政經濟大事記」，亦以該行爲起訖，屬於一行之績業。但對於一般及專門研論經濟的人，仍有其參考的效用，則以內容雖屬多人執筆，輕重觀點，容不一致，可是執筆者俱屬專家，多本資料立論，不無可稱。章士釗先生「紀念惑言」，於該行創辦人盛宜懷氏，有所議論，其中有云：「鼎革之日，公以主張鐵道國有，尸天下重謗。實則當時條列，所爲顧恤商本者甚備，此計一隳，川粵漢路至今未成，蘆漢所貸比款，早經如約償淸，並不如留學生之所檄陳，倘全路緣美款而集事，三省棣通於三十餘年前，民生之所利賴於斯者當何如。今事後而論成敗，幾無一不見公之忠於謀國，勇於任怨，即論士之最激急者，亦將無以易是言。」頗爲持平之論。盛氏雖不足語於大政治家之列，然今之大政治家得其「任怨」的精神，爲忠國之謀，彌有足稱。淸季此種精神，於曾·李尤足見之，今則令人有幾幾乎息矣之感。所謂「新政治家」，日以迎合媚世爲行動的標準，固一時患得患失之心使然，亦由學養見識根抵不深之故，舉世從風，言也行也，無往而不見其「衝動」的痕跡，此誠令人大可悲的地方。按三十一年北京修綆堂曾出版盛氏之「盛愚齋存稿附東遊日記」，盛氏經歷船路礦務四十餘年，凡所存稿，爲考訂晚淸政治經濟交通外交等方面的重要史料，詳論盛氏，可以取資。</p>
<p>本册除杜章兩氏以上所稱兩文外，有宋漢章「五十年來中國金融之演進」，陳光甫「五十年來之中國金融」，楊蔭溥「五十年來之中國銀行業」，秦潤卿「五十年來上海之錢莊業」，黃秉維「五十年來之中國工礦業」，壽景偉「五十年來之中國國際貿易」，王效文「五十年來之中國保險業」，張白衣「二十六年來之中國信託事業」，駱淸華「五十年來之中國經濟」各篇。論列時多重複，實衆手成書所不可或免的現象。其中如楊·秦·黃·壽諸氏之文，彌有參考價値。雖非賣品，然以贈送公私機關之故，尙非難見，故特爲文介紹，以吿國內之研讀近數十年財政經濟之歷史的人們。</p>
<p>「危城記」曾陸續在申報上發表，成爲我每天必讀的課程之一；這次排印成書後，我又重複看了一遍。對於這部書，我有着一種偏愛，因爲這一部書所選擇的背景剛好是我本身所親自經歷的塲合，听以特別感到親切有味。</p>
<p>本書的作者秦瘦鷗，也是我們熟識的作家，他過去曾寫了很多書，尤以「秋海棠」的出版，在六年前曾獲得廣大的讀者，且被搬上舞台，創造了演出的紀錄。可是「危城記」無論在文字的鍜鍊上，技巧的運用上，材料的處理上，比前有了很大的進步。在購買力普遍衰落的今日，能够有這樣一本書出版，自然是可以欣喜的，但有多少讀者有餘力來購致收藏？這却是個問題。</p>
<h3 id="c121">危城記讀後 <a href="#c121" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e121" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">121</a></h3>
<p>— 胡漢君</p>
<p>秦瘦鷗創作　懷正文化社出版</p>
<p>「危城記」在事實上並不只是一本小說，她實在是一部忠實地記錄了抗戰末期的大悲劇的一章的歷史。從這一本書裏，讀者不僅可以窺見這一個階段的輪廓，且可因此透視了當時的一般機構與抗戰脫節的內幕。在這二百五十頁的紙面中，作者能盡量地把握並且揭露了那些披着美麗的外衣裏面所包藏着的荒淫卑劣的胴體的實質。在這二百五十頁的紙面中，作者能吸收並且消化這一個段落裏的許多眞實的各型的面相，清晰地描繪成一個整幅的書面，展覽在我們而前，而這些面相却都是我們平時所接觸和熟悉的人物，不論是諸協理或熊處長，電影皇后潘太太或小沈，徐紹明或總經理太太。豈止在幾年以前，即使在現在，我們也可以在任何一個時間，任何一個角落看到。作者對於這些演員的安排並不誇張和煊染，因此使我們因它的恰到好處而感到親切和眞實，這一點應該說是作者最大的成功。</p>
<p>作者在這本書裏，對於側身於抗戰的陣營中而忘記了責任的人（我們也許都在內）也提出了警吿：「敵人快打過來了！誰去抵擋？怎樣抵擋？再追過來我們怎麼辦」？我們回想到湘桂之戰時的後方的混亂和彼此從不想到怎樣去加强作戰，而只是作着逃難的打算的各種情形，無怪作者終於無可容忍地對於這些敗北主義者毫不容情地解剖了他們的肺腑：「好像抗戰根本是別人的事，他們祇管一件事—逃難」！我們真該彼此臉紅。</p>
<p>作者曾親自看到而且參加了這個大悲劇的演出，所以對抗戰的後方看得相當淸楚。事實上，八年的抗戰究竟有多少人確曾爲抗戰盡了力量？無論在前方或後方，眞不知有多少人只在利用了這一面神聖的旗幟，做他們自身升官或發財的幌子。這突臨的災難恰好做了一次照妖鏡，照出了諸色人等的眞正的嘴臉。作者很能執行了這個任務。</p>
<p>但是作者也畢竟是個感情豐富的人，所以在記錄下這些現象之後，終於悲切地感慨起來：「那真是危城啊？應該說」愚人之城「才名副其實」。在目前有幾個不是愚人呢？</p>
<p>作者在這一册書裏，也借了祝兆年的嘴巴，抨擊了那個時候的衙門制度與官僚作風。他狂吼道：「公事！公事！全中國那麼許多人，天天在辦公事，才辦到了今日這麼一天！這樣的公事再要辦下去，中國非亡不可！」這是何等沉痛的呼聲？其實又豈僅是抗戰那一個時期是如此？現在是勝利，而且轉變成戡亂時期了，過去的那些肌淋淋的敎訓並不曾把這種衙門制度與官僚作風推動改變些「危城記」雖則完成在二年以前可是在今天讀來，還依然是一冊最新鮮的書。而且我深信這樣下去，即使十年以後，也不會有什麼推動改變，那麼這一部書且將長期地成爲一本新鮮的書。豈不可悲？</p>

<h3 id="c122">火炬的象徵 <a href="#c122" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e122" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">122</a></h3>
<p>— 靖文</p>
<p>本文發表的時候，由首都總統府門首出發的火炬長跑，想來一定已經到了上海終點，第七屆的全國運動會，也已經在熱鬧地進行了。</p>
<p>火炬當然是象徵着生命的光明，熱烈，勇敢與智慧，一言以蔽之，也就是象徵的Sportsmanship。希臘神話中的普羅米修士，即是第一個自天上盜取火種到人間來的勇士，雖備受刑罰的痛苦，但可說是天下第一個火炬長跑家。這雖然是神話，但就人類的文明發展史言，火毫無疑問是人類文明的起源與動力。歷史學家曾根據人類的主要生活道具，將人類文明劃分成石器，靑銅，鐵，電氣等各個時代，但火却始終是一切時代的基本動力。就是在人類文明將步入原子時代的目前，若說人類文明從此可以晚離火的關係，畢竟是難能想像的。</p>
<p>火是象徵光明與熱力，這更無待解釋，我們這個世界上的一切生物的生命本源，就是火，因爲太陽的本身就是一團火與熱。至於火是智慧的象徵，則是因爲智慧必然包含着光明與熱力。智慧啓發痴愚，光明驅除黑暗，要是人心中沒有火種，世界上沒有光明，人類的生活還有甚麼希望！</p>
<p>然而火也是被人認爲最可怕的東西。星星之火可以燎原，全世界每年所遭火災的損失，是無法估計的。而最可怕的自然是戰爭之火。一樣是一個火種，在智慧之神普羅米修士的手中它是象徵的光明與智慧，而在戰爭之神馬士的手中，却又象徵了黑暗與毀滅。宗敎家口中所說的地獄，是一片火海，但道是完全屬於毀滅性的火，是滅絕人性的火。</p>
<p>人對於火懷有如此不同的看法，並不是因爲火眞有甚麼不同，而祇在人對於火的處理的不同。火是一種威力，祗有在人知道怎樣善用這種威力的時候，火才是一種善與光明的力量，否則玩火焚身，古有明訓，火是玩不得的！</p>
<p>這一次的全國運動會，集合全國健兒於一堂，他們都可說是我們這個民族的火種。魷中有不少來自遠省邊埵與僑胞的靑年，尙是第一次到祖國的心臟部份來看看。我相信他們的心中對於祖國一定懷着火一樣的熱誠與希望。奪得錦標與否，是一個次要問題，重要的是怎樣使這輩滿腔熱誠而來的靑年男女，能對祖國帶了良好的印象回去。</p>
<p>眼前的祖國雖在一片戰火之中，但這一次的全國遝動會，却並不是粉飾太平的點綴，因爲這次各地選手的參加，都是出於自發的熱情。有許多選手已經表示他們這次前來不在想奪取錦標，因為錦標屬誰，都是一樣的光榮，與世運的意義稍有不同。他們這次遠道而來的主要目的，是想要多多親近祖國，多多認識祖國。遠省與僑胞的靑年對於祖國懷着這樣熱切的愛忱，誠使人不得不深爲感動。</p>
<p>如果中國的靑年對於國家個個懷着熱切的愛忱，中國就永遠有希望。一部份的外國人雖視眼前的中國已經陷入不可救藥的混亂，例如最近紐約先鋒論壇報出版的「世界旅行與貿易指南」中，即曾將中國列入「問題區」。但祗要每一個中國的靑年相信其祖國是有希望的，則外人暫時的印象，就不足介懷。</p>
<p>這一次的全國運動會能集合全國千萬靑年於一堂，即就吿訴了全世界：中國目前雖在混亂中，似中國靑年在精神上是始終不脫離祖國的，他們對於祖國始終懷着火一樣的熱誠。那怕目前國內交通頻受摧殘，他們仍不遠千里而來。說規模滅然比不上倫敦舉行的世運，但其所表現的意義，則與完全想爲吸引外國遊客，從而想吸取外匯爲目的的世運根本異趣。</p>
<p>從首都總統府出發的火炬長跑，形式上是傳訓，實際上即是暗示着一個新的光明的火炬，將燃起每一個人民心中的火種。由全國靑年的團結一堂，將進而達到中國的和平團結！至少我個人是這樣的希望着。</p>

<p>描寫沒有護照的國外流亡者：「他們不知道往哪兒去，可是第二天早晨，還不待你醒來，他們却早就走掉了。那時候他們倒知道往哪兒去啦。」</p>
<p>論女人；「天下的女人，要是不被拋棄，就該被尊敬，決無中庸之道的。」</p>
<p>論生死：「活着的東西才能够動——才會有力量，有風度，有荒謬——然而却不會有那種永遠不能再行動，祗會流於腐爛的東西們所具有的奇異的莊嚴。祗有完成的東西，才會具此特性：而人類却祗有在死里才能達到完成——而道時間也是很短促的。」</p>
<p>關於人品：「憤世嫉俗的人，往往有高尙的人格，而理想主義者却偏偏是不很可靠的。」</p>

<p>— 錢大成</p>
<p>晚近江南書家好模仿翁相國同龢，然得其法乳，且能亂眞者，以常熟趙古泥爲第一。古泥，名石，字石農，自號泥道人，西唐市人也。少從其父賣藥縣之金邨；里中有比賽醫法之舉，名列前茅者例有獎金，列末名者則贈以菜油一担，令焚膏繼晷，努力臨池，實致議誚之意也。衆人名列末等者，羞憤欲絕，每棄不取。古泥初與賽，竟殿其軍，乃荷此一担菜汕而歸；衆人致誚，不復顧也。越數月，又與盛，竟冠其軍，衆聳異之。其鄰有豆腐店老闆笑謂衆曰：「此子亦非倖成也！夜半，我每起磨豆腐，已見其家一燈熒熒。窺之，彼正在習字也，刻苦自勵若是，安得不成功乎？」衆乃嘆服。</p>
<p>時金邨有金某者，狂人也，能篆刻，古泥請爲刻一石章，金某叱之曰：「爾亦令余刻石耶？」古泥憤而從金友竹熠刻石，其名寖寖日上。旣而入城主沈石友家，（石友名汝瑾，專藏古硯，能詩，著有鳴堅白齋詩集。）石友與吳昌碩相莫逆，禺碩時來常熟，古泥遂得受學於昌碩，益工刻畫，兼精書畫瓷銅玉石之學。時翁相國革職家居，不與紼紳通，獨與布衣之士交往。古泥時往謁，乃受知謚相國，兼習相國書體，有時且爲之代筆。相國垂歿，以自用圖章兩方贈之，蓋示傳硯之意也。古泥所仿翁字遂流遍江南，竟可亂眞。迨修名旣立，亦不復爲之。時人所仿翁字，直春蚓秋蛇耳。</p>
<p>古泥晚年名益高，達官貴人請治印，銖鋪必較，未賞曲狗人意。共布衣交，則言必信，行必果，千金一擲，與同邑楊旡恙先生尤稱莫逆，嘗共至蘇州西園寺，寺側多垂楊，兩人駐足聽黃鸝鳴聲竟日。旁人笑其痴絕，不顧也。</p>
<p>古泥美鬚髯，岸然道貌。好駡人，人亦不敢與之爭。三原于右任先生至虞山，訪古泥，共啜茗于逍遙遊，（常熟茶館，今則改爲醫院。）對坐談藝，兩人容貌酷肖，人望之若神仙也。</p>
<p>古泥性至怪僻，病瘧，醫囑忌食某物，即進某物，且拒不服藥餌；病遂殆。乃遍招親舊，抗手訣別，請人作墓誌，並生挽詩，亟欲目覩。自營生壙于虞山西麓，署曰「金石龕」，以其夫人金姓也。遺囑薄斂，桐棺三寸而已。家人能遵其敎。無子，女林，能世其學。（編者按：古泥先生之女公子工書法，適名書家蕭退關先生之子。）古泥嘗詔之曰：「一切雜技，胸中皆不可無書，有書而後可幾於古。……摩印之法，求諸金石文字及篆法則易得，徒購刀法則難成。六朝以下，篆法雖工，往往以姿媚不能入印。鄧完白作印，白文不越漢人藩籬，善者十五六，朱文則益以己意，太姿媚，善者十二三而已。予印不能如吳缶老非古不學，以成一代宗工也。…」其言如是，不第論治印，亦可以見其爲人已。</p>

<p>「季秋月朔，辰弗集於房，許奏鼓，嗇夫馳，庶人走，羲和尸厥官，罔知聞，昏瘚於天象，以干先王之誅。政典曰：先時者殺無赦，不及時者殺無赦」這是我國最早的日蝕的紀錄，記載於書經中。羲氏與和氏，乃是唐虞夏三代專司天文的兩大族，極富於天文智識，可是在夏代仲康時，未能克守職責，未將這次日蝕的日期預先推算出來，以致舉國人民慌得手忙足亂，有的打鼓，有的射箭，想將太陽拯救出來，後來，那兩個「失職」的天文官都被判死刑，因爲根據那時的法律，凡是推算的太遲或過早者，都應受死刑的處罰，可知那時的天文的研究，已經有相當的成就了。</p>
<p>南菲洲里梯慮地方，某次遭逢日全蝕，其後，礦工要求礦主發雙工，他們的理由是因爲他們已經工作了二日，雖然這其間的夜裏是很短促的，結果，他們得到勝利。</p>
<p>希臘古代七智之首的天文家泰理斯，曾經藉日蝕的機會，解決了一次戰爭。在公元前五百八十五年，米逖士與耐梯安斯兩族，戰爭了數年，猶未能分勝敗，泰理斯推測知道將要日蝕，乃先揚言於雙方軍隊中說：「天心厭戰，將要顯示日蝕警吿衆人。」其後，當雙方交戰正激烈的時候，白畫忽變爲晚上，兩方兵士遂認爲上天眞的厭戰而言和。</p>
<p>公元前三百十年，錫勒巧族爲加色人所追逐，首領亞格索古盧承領戰船六十艘是夜逃亡海上，黎明時，適逢日蝕，曙光復隱，星斗又陣，亞乃宣吿部下說：「日蝕爲事變之朕兆，是我們轉敗爲勝之象徵」。衆信，軍心復振，六日後，加色的土地上，已插上了錫萬戰旗。</p>

<p>— 談客</p>
<p>馬路旁的電桿木上刷着白底黑字「吐痰害人傳染癆病」的標語，但是你要在街上蹓躂蹓躂的話，就隨時會遇到仍在悠然隨地吐痰的人。</p>
<p>好像有人說過我們中國人的處事態度大多很隨便，心之所至，便什麼都顧不了，雖然明知吐痰害人，但一痰在喉，不吐不快，而痰之來又不受時間空間的限制，於是隨來隨吐，只要痰出口，根本不去顧慮到那口痰會掉在那兒，反正與自己無干了。</p>
<p>我國對於鬼神的傳說一向是「像煞有介事」的，聽人說某種事做不得，做了，鬼神便會怎樣怎樣的對付你，心裏怕鬼神怎樣怎樣的對付，也就不去做了。可惜「切勿吐痰」這一項，沒有給我們幾千年前的老祖宗附上些鬼神的話，不然，還用到處刷標語勸止嗎？早就不勸而自止了！</p>
<p>不過話又說回來，勸止勿做某事某事而附以「鬼話」，原是勸止者的聰明處，他抓住了人類的弱點——利己性，然後加以「鬼化」，做則不利於己，於是利己心重的人便戰戰兢兢的不去做了。不信，試把勸止吐痰的標語改爲「吐痰害人天誅地滅」字樣，就定能收效。</p>

<p>古玩者，「物稀爲貴」，適應人類之好奇心，故不論其人其事之賢愚優劣，只要所留之物好玩難得，便是可居之奇貨，所謂留芳遺奧各有千秋。</p>
<p>故如明嚴嵩一代權奸，殃民禍國，正史旣加以斧鉞，戯劇及小說亦備極形容，萬人唾駡，然而舊京北平市街幾家老店舖如「六必居」「鶴年堂」之匾額，相傳爲嚴分宜書者，竟致人人稱道，認爲奇蹟。又如袁世凱之「洪憲皇帝」，不但背叛民國，而且八十三天的短夢，貽笑萬方，然其特製之瓷器，有「洪憲年製」「居仁堂製」款識者，竟與乾嘉名窰同價，因只製成一批，「皇祚」即吿終，眞品無多，製作亦頗精巧。其皇旗皇璽等，則在故宮午門上歷史博物館與太平天國之天王簧璽及洪楊之遺物，及周秦漢宋之鼎彝古器並陳，各占史蹟之一部。（前淸同治甲子年六月，曾國荃軍入金陵，得洪氏之天王璽，呈於其兄國藩。國藩先以上品玉版宜紙印有五十頁，乃將原璽及其他戰利品獻於淸廷。曾公以所印分賜得力將領，以爲紀念，並親加題識。光緒年間，舊時諸將，後刪式微，輒以所領「璽」片作古董出售，每片値五六百金，貴逾宋明古畫。淸廷得此璽後，亦珍襲藏於宮內，故民國後由淸室接收一切古物，此璽仍然完好無缺，陳列於博物館，人人得而瞻覽。假若淸代未亡，此璽尙在其大內爲御玩之珍秘可知。</p>
<p>前冬曾讀西電，知歐美玩郵家，以很大的價錢，收買法國「維琪」票。按「維琪政府」是一九四零年老將貝當（一譯佩丹，原文Petain）簽訂對德和約的「偽組織」，一九四五盟軍勝利後，「維琪」的當局皆已被逮處刑，則其所發行之郵票之爲「僞票」，自無疑義，但通用雖不可，收藏却有味，因爲僞物不可再得，够上Curio了。</p>
<p>三十四年八月，日本宣布投降後之一年間，舊京僞物滿街拋賣，甚麼「滿州國」的，「冀東」的一切東西，賤値亦沒人要，賣者怕挨駡，只好躱在僻巷空塲兜售，還常遭受白眼相看，是乃積憤與正義之反映。但近兩年的風氣，「僞」貨漸稀，却又成了「奇貨」。由可厭可惡的東西，而轉到可玩可搜的Curio。此非「人」的觀念之變更，而是「物」的性質之改觀。原來僞「滿」僞「冀東」那些傀儡時代，雖然優孟衣冠，亦自舖張盡致，如甚麼「開國紀念品」「典禮册」「磁銀器皿」之類，都加工製造，而黑幕牽綫的倭人，又是長於工事技巧的，幫助粉飾，金碧輝煌，裝璜美妙。所以「康德」（溥儀在「滿」年號）署款的文件貨物，大有追步「袁皇洪憲」之勢。僞國務總理鄭孝胥氏，原是老名士，以善書馳名，其人於民國二十七年病故，在僞「滿」做了六七年的「開國元勳」，寫了許多有關「典禮」的册頁，現在亦成了稀罕之物，比他未「奸」以前的字册還値綫。非重「奸」也，重其Curio也。</p>

The main force of the 7th Bandit Column, originally in Linzi, was encircled and suffered heavy losses by the National Army. The 19th Division then suddenly broke out and, along with the reinforcing 9th and 13th Columns, attacked our Weigu and Wudengdian, attempting to threaten the flanks of the National Army.

<p>[Our Correspondent in Taiyuan, 5th] The fierce battle in Linfen, an important town in southern Shanxi, has now lasted for two months, and the staunch defense of Ying County, a key point in northern Shanxi, has also lasted for more than twenty days. The fighting has reached its peak, with fortifications and city walls repeatedly destroyed and rebuilt. The National Army is resisting stubborn enemies with more than ten times their strength. The bandit casualties in the attack on Linfen have exceeded 50,000, and reinforcements are constantly being sent to maintain a force of 50,000 to 60,000 men. The bandit casualties in the attack on Ying County have also reached tens of thousands. The bandits, desperate due to heavy losses from counterattacks, launched poison gas shells against the National Army in Linfen on the night of the 3rd. On the same day, they also used poison gas, smoke screens, and incendiary shells in Ying County. Until the 4th, the bandits in Ying County, under the cover of more than fifty artillery pieces, launched wave after wave of attacks, swarming up the city walls sixteen or seventeen times. The defending troops fought fiercely with bayonets. On the 4th, with the help of the Air Force, the bandit forces were somewhat weakened. Many civilian houses in the charred city were destroyed by artillery fire, with more than a hundred civilians killed or injured. Bandit casualties exceeded 3,000. The defending troops are rushing to block the collapsing city walls. Linfen was attacked by more than forty bandit artillery pieces and nine bandit brigades from the 3rd to the evening of the 4th. The city walls were breached in two places, but the stubborn enemy was finally repelled. Both cities stand firm, but the military and civilian losses are heavy, and assistance is urgently needed.</p>

<p>[United States Information Service, Washington, 4th] President Truman today issued a proclamation announcing that the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade will take effect for China on May 22, 1948. The United States signed the agreement with 22 other countries in Geneva last October 20. The President took this action after learning that the Chinese government had signed the Provisional Application Draft of the General Agreement on April 21, 1948. According to the provisions of the draft, China will make the agreement effective 30 days after the date of signature. China is the eleventh country to make the agreement effective and the first country in the Far East to do so. In addition to the United States, other countries that have made the agreement effective include: United Kingdom, France, Belgium, Netherlands, Luxembourg, Canada, Australia, Cuba, and Czechoslovakia. Under the General Agreement, China makes concessions on goods needed by the United States, amounting to approximately US$52 million in 1939 trade. Existing import duties on many items, such as office machinery, lightweight vehicles, lathes, canned milk, lubricating oils and greases, tires, and vacuum tubes, have been reduced. For a wide range of other items, where current tax rates are largely considered generally low, these tax rates will be maintained. These materials include those related to the United States, such as cotton, tobacco, wheat, flour, certain dried fruits, radios, motor vehicles and lathes other than lightweight ones, agricultural machinery, pumps, refrigerators, machine tools, certain foods, and special dyes. China and the other signatory countries to the agreement are subject to certain restrictions on the application for foreign exchange, withdrawal restrictions, foreign exchange controls, customs valuation, and the conduct of state-run trade. These provisions are very important because they require China and the other signatory countries to give fair treatment to trade with the United States. The United States' concessions on exports to China in the General Agreement apply to goods with a standard value of nearly US$62.3 million in 1939. Of this trade, US$37.8 million worth of products are listed on the current US duty-free list. Items in which the United States has agreed to reduce tariffs and which are of major interest to China include bristles, tungsten, frozen dried eggs, walnuts, hat braids, total flower and lace clothing, embroidered handkerchiefs, and certain oils. Tung oil, raw silk, and certain types of fur and hides can still be imported duty-free. The current tax rate on pig bristles is guaranteed not to increase. These concessions must be granted after the most careful consideration and public presentation of opinions by the various government agencies involved in the negotiations, in order to ensure that domestic producers are not seriously harmed by these concessions. However, any of these concessions may be withdrawn or modified to such an extent as to prevent or remedy such losses if, due to unforeseen circumstances, imports from China increase to such an extent that they cause serious damage to domestic producers or create such a threat. This provision thus provides protection for the interests of domestic producers.</p>
<h3 id="e9">Wu Tiecheng Discusses Democracy; Believes Success or Failure Hinges on the People; Urgently Hopes that Kuomintang Members Will Unite and Be Progressive <a href="#e9" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c9" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">9</a></h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 5th] Wu Tiecheng, Secretary-General of the Central Party Headquarters, spoke on the 5th about his expectations for establishing a democratic style and the Kuomintang members exerting their united strength. He first pointed out that if any democratic country in the world wants to promote democratic politics universally and deeply and achieve brilliant achievements, it must not only abide by the law but also strive to cultivate good political habits. Because the success or failure of democratic politics is the government's inherent responsibility, but the people's attitude is also the most critical. Only when every citizen can care about politics, understand politics, distinguish between right and wrong, and distinguish between right and wrong can the politics of the people, by the people, and for the people be achieved. Politicians in advanced countries are all working hard to create good political habits, which become a kind of unwritten law and have a permanent exemplary effect, the effect of which is even greater than written law. The democratic style of Britain and the United States is built on this unbreakable foundation. The recent presidential and vice-presidential elections can be called a good model. The winner is not arrogant, and the loser is content. There is not only no slightest discord between the two, but they also congratulate and comfort each other. This style is truly precious. Wu also said: In a democratic country, politics cannot be exercised without political parties, which is a common understanding among those in the know. However, whether political parties can be good at exercising politics depends on whether they themselves have policies that are appropriate to the needs of the times and strong solidarity. If a political party can unite the entire party into one and exert its entire strength to promote its policy of seeking welfare for the people and progress for the country, it can naturally gain the people's confidence and shoulder the country's heavy responsibility. Wu said in conclusion: Therefore, I earnestly hope that all members of the party will understand that the party still bears the greatest responsibility in the politics after the implementation of the constitution. If we want to achieve this sacred task, we must concentrate our efforts, urgently reform, concentrate our will, strictly organize, and go to a common goal. Wu finally emphasized: During this period of suppressing the rebellion, there are many difficulties. Whether we can overcome them depends on whether the party can exert its entire strength and the comrades can serve the country. This is the time. If we can sacrifice the small to complete the great self, then although the situation is difficult and the responsibility is heavy, I firmly believe that we will be able to complete the mission of suppressing the rebellion and building the country.</p>

<p>[Our Correspondent in Nanjing, 5th] Bullitt arrived in Nanjing at 7 AM on the 5th, taking the night train from Shanghai. Chairman Chiang's representative You Jianwen, Mayor Shen's representative Bao Zichen, Foreign Minister Wang's representative Wei Xuezhi, as well as Minister of Propaganda Li Weiguo, Director-General of the Lizi Society Huang Renlin, and US Military Advisors, including Lieutenant General Badowin and Group Leader Major General Keikul, all went to the station to greet him in their private capacities.

<p>[Our Correspondent in Nanjing, 5th] Chairman Chiang summoned Xu Fulin, Ji Yiqiao, and Jiang Yuntian of the Democratic Socialist Party at 10 AM on the morning of the 5th to explain the issue of the elected legislators. Xu did not go due to a cold, and Ji and Jiang went accompanied by Lei Zhen. The Chairman first explained to them the method of handling election disputes and said that it was possible to remedy the unsuccessful candidates from the Democratic Socialist Party. Ji and others replied that they would report back to the party leaders and then left. The key members of the Democratic Socialist Party have all taken planes and trains to Shanghai in the afternoon and evening of the 5th to attend the Central Committee meeting on the 6th and discuss the current issues. Also, when Chairman Chiang spoke with them, he earnestly expressed his hope that the two parties would continue to cooperate with the Kuomintang to the end as they originally intended. However, according to the Democratic Socialist Party, this point is worth considering. Under these circumstances, the Legislative Yuan will not be able to participate, and the government does not want to participate either. It is also learned that the Youth Party is also dissatisfied with this attitude, and the key members of the party have also gone to Shanghai separately to convene the Central Committee meeting to discuss and decide on the party's policies.</p>

<h3 id="e15">On the Exchange of Notes Between China and the U.S. and the Use of U.S. Aid <a href="#e15" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c15" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">15</a></h3>
<p>Following the passage of the U.S. Aid to China Act by Congress on April 2nd, it was signed by President Truman and handed to the State Department for implementation. The total amount of aid to China is $463 million. Out of that amount, $125 million is specifically earmarked for military use, while the remaining $338 million is for economic assistance. Therefore, how will this U.S. aid be used? What specific materials will it include? And how will it be allocated? These questions have long been a matter of concern for both the government and the public in China and the United States. On April 30th, our ambassador to the United States, Dr. V.K. Wellington Koo, and U.S. Secretary of State Marshall exchanged documents. The contents of the exchange were published on the 3rd of this month, stating that all procedures are pending the establishment of a bilateral agreement. The Executive Yuan of our country also decided at its meeting on the 4th to establish a U.S. Aid Utilization Committee, responsible for proper management and utilization. However, before the signing of the bilateral agreement, up until July 3rd of this year, the Sino-U.S. Relief Agreement signed on October 27th of last year will still be followed. This indicates that this U.S. aid can now be partially implemented, with the type and method of implementation being exactly the same as the Sino-U.S. Relief Agreement. Although the amount of assistance is not explicitly specified, according to the provisions of Section 406 of the original bill, it will not exceed the $50 million advanced by the Finance and Rehabilitation Bureau.</p>
<p>According to the various provisions of the Sino-U.S. Relief Agreement, the main points are: (1) The United States will supply certain basic necessities, namely food, medicine, ready-made and unfinished clothing, fertilizers, insecticides, fuel, and seeds. (2) In addition to free distribution, the above materials should be properly allocated together with similar items produced or imported by China, to ensure that people of all social strata receive a fair and equal share. (4) Efforts should be made to implement a rationing system and price control system in major cities. (5) The funds from the sale of materials, except for agreed-upon uses, should be used for relief and work relief projects in China, and it is stated that this plan should be jointly determined by designated personnel from China and representatives from the United States, in order to ensure rapid and appropriate use. According to this precedent, it can be proven that the currently available U.S. aid simultaneously has two meanings: one is economic, namely suppressing prices, and the other is for relief, namely supplying materials.</p>
<p>The so-called suppression of prices refers to the price control system required to be implemented in the agreement, the method of which is to implement rationing, the source of which is the same materials provided by both countries. This is currently being gradually implemented in the five major cities. It was originally scheduled to run for four months, ending at the end of June. Now that the initial method of U.S. aid has been decided to follow this model, it is no different from an extension of the Relief Agreement, and this rationing system can naturally be smoothly extended again.</p>
<p>The Sino-U.S. Agreement originally stipulated that the funds from the relief goods would be used to support China's improvement of consumption and price controls. It also included a condition requiring our country to provide the same materials produced locally or imported from abroad to cooperate and expand the effect. This illustrates that to truly improve consumption and control prices, relying solely on U.S. relief materials is not enough. Therefore, we must also mention whether the basic necessities produced, purchased, ordered, and received by the government can be allocated or sold at a subsidized price according to this example, in order to respond to the foreign desire to improve consumption and control prices. Since the War of Resistance, suppressing prices has been a consistent policy of the government. To date, the various measures taken in finance, trade, loans, foreign exchange, and domestic exchange all seem to be heading in this direction. In recent days, a new wave of price increases has been stirring again. If price controls are limited to foreign relief materials, while excluding the materials that we already hold or can control as much as possible, insisting on selling only at the highest price or market price, or even holding onto them without releasing them, waiting for an even higher price in the future, I wonder if this is in line with the government's policy of suppressing prices and stabilizing people's livelihoods?</p>
<p>As for relief, the Sino-U.S. Agreement stipulates that the funds from the sale of materials are to be used for relief and work relief. The period for implementing rationing is already halfway over, and there are so many refugees in various places, and the disaster areas affected by war are so vast. I wonder if the relief and work relief plans that our country should provide have been drafted? What exactly is its content? This is what the disaster areas, the refugees, and the local authorities where refugees are concentrated are anxiously awaiting every day. Now that the first step of U.S. aid is being handled in accordance with the Sino-U.S. Agreement, the proceeds from the sale of materials, as well as the various relief materials that are not sold but directly provided free of charge, can be planned as a whole, expanding the scope, and quickly finding a practical and effective way out for refugees in various places. In our opinion, whether it is passive relief or active assistance, all measures should primarily be directly related to the lives of the refugees.</p>
<p>In addition to food, cotton, fuel, and medicine, relief materials originally included fertilizers, seeds, and insecticides. If work relief is limited in scope and cannot accommodate as much as possible, it may be possible to select more land plots and encourage reclamation in order to return to agriculture. Currently, there is abandoned land in all provinces, and the lack of strong laborers and the abandonment of fields are a concern. It is not necessary to insist that only Sanmen Bay is an ideal place for reclamation. What is worrying is that no one is responsible, and excuses are made, then who would be willing to eagerly respond to the call and find trouble for themselves? Therefore, it is alright if we do not want to solve this serious problem for the refugees, but if we really want to solve this serious problem, then the central competent departments should grasp the key points and take on this matter.</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 5th] A spokesman for the Ministry of Finance stated: The collection of estimated profit-seeking enterprise income tax in various regions is proceeding extremely smoothly. Currently, most commercial establishments in Tianjin, Taiyuan, Baotou, Xi'an, Baoji, Jinjiang, Longyan Fuliang, Guilin, Jiaxing, Wuhu, Hengyang, Bengbu, Changde, Linyu, Changchun, Kunming, Xiamen, Hanjiang, Shaoyang, Dangtu, Datong, Xuanzhou, Guixian, Jiuquan, Nanjing, Wuxi, Wuxian, Xuzhou, Zhenjiang, Songjiang, Nantong, Changzhou, Jiangdu, Linhai, Xining, Longxi, Hefei, Sazhou, and other places have paid their taxes on time. In Shanghai, the number of commercial establishments that have paid their taxes has also reached over 10,000 units. Regarding public enterprises, the Ministry has also sent letters to the relevant authorities instructing them to pay on time, otherwise they will be sent to court for punishment according to law, without any leniency. Although some chambers of commerce have requested a reduction in the estimated multiple, they were sternly rejected because it concerns the fiscal budget and legitimate national taxes. Recently, there have been rumors outside that the Ministry has approved the requests of various chambers of commerce, changing the estimated tax from six times to four times, etc., all of which are unfounded and have ulterior motives. It is hoped that commercial establishments in various industries will not be fooled and must comply with the regulations and pay on time without further delay to avoid being subject to penalties.</p>

According to Wu Bannong, chairman of the Compensation and Return Committee of our delegation in Japan, Chinese citizens must pay attention to the above deadline.

Wu urged Chinese citizens to submit their applications as soon as possible and emphasized that supporting documents or vouchers must be attached to the application.</p>

<h3 id="e33">Qingdao Intensifies Preparations to Observe the Solar Eclipse; 40 People Participate in the Work <a href="#e33" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c33" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">33</a></h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Qingdao, 5th] The Qingdao Observatory is preparing to observe the solar eclipse on the 9th. Rehearsals have reached the most intense stage in recent days and will be ready on the 7th. The collaboration is with Shandong University, and 40 people are participating in the fieldwork. Qingdao has excellent equipment, and the observation items are divided into five: (1) Drawing of the solar shadow, using an 8 cm diameter small equatorial instrument for projection; (2) Filming, using a 32 cm refracting large equatorial instrument to take one picture every five minutes, and take three pictures of the initial eclipse, maximum eclipse, and recovery; (3) Changes in the high-altitude ionosphere before and after the solar eclipse, selecting eight locations in Tokyo, Seoul, Xi'an, Lanzhou, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Changchun, and Kulun to measure the strength of radio waves. This work is led by Chen Baokang, director of the Department of Electrical Engineering of Shandong University. Chen had observed this during the solar eclipse on June 19, 1947, and obtained results; (4) Taking spectra, jointly led by Wang Hengshou, director of the Department of Physics of Zhongda University (Wang is on leave in Qingdao), and Guo Yicheng, director of the Department of Physics of Shandong University. The spectroscope used belongs to Shandong University and was transported to Lanzhou from Chongqing to observe the solar eclipse in 1941; (5) Changes in temperature, altitude, and air pressure, using a recording instrument that rotates once every two hours. The Observatory had also proposed moving the equipment here south to the zone of total eclipse for observation, but the conditions were limited and the proposal was not realized. It should be noted that Qingdao is not in the zone of total eclipse, but the eclipse fraction is 98%.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Hangzhou, 5th] The Solar Eclipse Observation Team, jointly formed by the Academia Sinica and the Surveying and Mapping Bureau of the Ministry of National Defense, led by Chen Zun-gui, came to Hangzhou and decided to go to Shibianwu, Huanghu Town, Yuhang tomorrow to observe the annular solar eclipse. Their important task is to determine the time of the initial eclipse, the beginning and end of the annular eclipse, and the time of the recovery, measure the change in brightness during the solar eclipse, and take pictures of the eclipse from the initial eclipse to the recovery. They have no contact with the American observation team that has set up a station on the top of Huanghu Mountain. The latter focuses on geodetic surveying and therefore chose the center point of the annular eclipse line.</p>

<h3 id="e38">The Kremlin Does Not Abandon Communist Ideas, Britain Will Never Compromise With the Soviet Union, Bevin Reports on the Diplomatic Situation to the House of Commons <a href="#e38" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c38" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">38</a></h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 4th] At the beginning of the two-day foreign affairs debate in the House of Commons, opposition spokesman Butler severely criticized the expansion of Soviet imperialism, pointing out that it has created dangerous points in Palestine, India, the Far East, and Southeast Asia, especially in China. Butler solemnly warned that decisive and visionary action should be taken not only in the West but also in Central and Far East. Butler stated, "The Soviet people have a global communist rule policy, which will inevitably exert pressure on any place in the world."</p>
<p>Earlier, when Foreign Secretary Bevin opened the debate, he spoke of international general relations, saying, "We have always felt that if we only had to deal with the Soviet Union without involving communism, then a solution would be possible. The factor hindering the agreement is that any solution that we engage in will be used to promote the goals of communism. Until the Kremlin changes its 'ideological attitude,' there will be few opportunities for truly lasting solutions between Britain and the Soviet Union."</p>
<p>Regarding the situation in Palestine, he said, "We have not abandoned our original resolution to end the mandate on May 15. We have accepted the responsibility to maintain law and order in that place before that day and to prevent aggression. We are willing to use military force to achieve this goal and to cover the withdrawal of our troops after May 15. We have used all our strength to stop the Arab countries from invading Palestine. Our attitude is to warn both sides that during the period when Britain maintains its mandate until May 15, we will never tolerate any form of intrusion. However, after May 15, we will never act against the will of any party or use our force to implement any solution. The urgent task now is that the shooting must stop immediately, and an institution must be established to allow wise opinions to exist. At this last moment, I still urge those seeking a solution not to give up their efforts. There is still time to use reason, but a few more days of turmoil will be too late."</p>
<h3 id="e39">Western European Alliance Seeks Self-Defense, Hopes Germany Can Achieve Reunification <a href="#e39" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c39" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">39</a></h3>
<p>Speaking of the Western European Alliance, Bevin emphasized that since his last speech on the Western European Alliance, steady, useful, and systematic progress has been made in realizing the goals he set at that time, which has made Western European countries affirmatively become a true part of Europe. The five signatory countries have all sacrificed narrow national interests, sometimes even fairly significant interests, to seek the common welfare of Europe, and have not deviated from the great and practical task that has already begun due to the concept of sovereignty. The five countries unanimously want to make the Western European Alliance Convention an effective tool for cooperation in every aspect, and believe that a solid foundation has been obtained at the beginning.</p>
<p>Bevin continued, "Regarding military issues, we have now reached the stage of joint review. In terms of defense, we have no intention of aggression against others. The security of the Western European Alliance countries should be the urgent task of responsible politicians and parliaments. This move will not lead to war. On the contrary, the division of Western countries and allowing them to continue to exist will inevitably leave Western European countries unable to defend themselves. Our freedom and survival, as well as the maintenance of Western European countries' position in the world, must be the goals of continued organization and attention. We still hope that other countries can participate in the Western European Alliance and cooperate with each other on absolutely equal terms."</p>
<p>Bevin then spoke of the recent dispute between Western countries and the Soviet Union in Berlin, strongly stating, "Our presence in Berlin is where our rights lie. We are determined to continue staying in Berlin. I believe that the attempt to solve this problem with a war of nerves will eventually end, and it can be replaced by open and honest negotiations. We still advocate the principle of German unification, but we also have to face the fact that there is currently no possibility of achieving the goal of a unified Germany. However, we have not given up hope for the future, and we will do our best to restore a reasonable and healthy standard of living for Germany, including economic and political life. The disunity of Germany hinders the development of its own country and its neighbors."</p>
<p>Regarding the Italian issue, Bevin acknowledged that there are still many obstacles to be overcome before the tasks Italy will undertake after the war can be clarified. Britain believes that Trieste should be returned to Italy. If that place can be returned to the Italian people living there, it is believed that there can be fair borders sufficient to establish peace and stability."</p>
<p>Bevin concluded, "Symbolically speaking at present, a good harvest is expected around the world this year. If so, the increase in food supply may not be a help to restoring world peace and normal conditions. It is hoped that world prices can generally fall, so that the European Recovery Program can fully exert its effectiveness. However, American aid cannot allow us to relax our efforts in any aspect. No matter what diplomatic achievements there are, factories, farms, and mines can make equal contributions to world peace, so production efforts should not be relaxed in the slightest."</p>

<p>[This Newspaper] San Francisco, 5th Broadcast: The U.S. House Foreign Affairs Committee began discussing the issue of reorganizing UN agencies. Marshall attended and stated his opinions, opposing any plan to reorganize the UN without the consent of the Soviet Union. Marshall stated, "We must convince the Soviet leaders that the Soviet Union can indeed 'live peacefully' with other countries. If we hastily reorganize the UN without the Soviet Union's consent, this institution will be destroyed and form an opposing military alliance. What we need now is not a new peace institution, but to make better use of the institutions that already exist."</p>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 4th] The House Foreign Affairs Committee today listened for the first time to the opinions of several Congressmen who advocate amending the UN Charter. About 30 Senators and Representatives have already proposed resolutions suggesting that the veto power should not be used on issues such as aggression, armed preparation for aggression, inspection and control of atomic and other weapons, and the establishment of an international security force. Democratic Representative Hayes and Republican Representative Javits came to the Foreign Affairs Committee today to express their opinions, advocating that the United States lead the amendment of the Charter. If the Soviet Union is willing to cooperate, it may cooperate with it. If the Soviet Union refuses to cooperate, there is no need to wait for its cooperation. Hayes strongly stated that these steps are not anti-Soviet, but are moving towards peace. Javits believes that if the United States and other countries in the world can show the Soviet Union that Soviet cooperation is not necessary, he believes that the Soviet Union will soon be able to automatically compromise.</p>
<h3 id="e42">The Four Powers Will Hold a Meeting in Nanjing to Discuss the Danube River Issue, Austria Will Attend as an Observer <a href="#e42" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c42" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">42</a></h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 5th] It was announced here today that the four powers of Britain, the United States, the Soviet Union, and France have agreed to hold a four-power conference in Belgrade this month to discuss the issue of controlling international shipping rights on the Danube River. The representatives attending the meeting will be high-level officials, and the agenda will include the entire Danube River issue after the war. Representatives from Austria and Yugoslavia will attend as observers. Historically, the Danube River issue has been one of the most thorny issues in Europe. The Soviet Union firmly believes that the international freedom of navigation on the Danube River cannot coexist with the modern concept of sovereignty. Western countries strongly advocate restoring the pre-war international freedom of navigation status.</p>
<p>It is generally believed that the four powers holding a meeting in Belgrade to discuss this matter is a sign of concession from Western countries. Western countries have probably recognized that fully allowing freedom of navigation on the Danube River is not permitted by the current situation. If the Soviet Union can also make some concessions, then the thorny Danube River issue will not be difficult to resolve.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 5th] According to the decision of the Foreign Ministers' Conference, the international conference on the future control of the Danube River should be convened six months after the Hungarian-Romanian-Bulgarian peace treaties come into effect, that is, on May 15. At that time, the Foreign Ministers' Conference decided not to stipulate the Danube River issue in the peace treaties, but to leave it to the international conference to be discussed six months after the peace treaties came into effect. In mid-March of this year, the United States suggested postponing this meeting until the end of this year. Britain has also agreed, but Britain has now accepted Moscow's suggestion to convene the Belgrade Conference in the near future. However, Britain also suggested holding preliminary discussions in Washington first to determine the procedures for the Belgrade Conference. The Soviet Union has not yet expressed its opinion on this proposal. The resolution of the 1946 Foreign Ministers' Conference stipulated that the Belgrade Conference should be held by the countries of the Danube River Basin, namely the Soviet Union, Ukraine, Bulgaria, Romania, Yugoslavia, Czechoslovakia, and Hungary, together with the other three powers of the Foreign Ministers' Conference, namely Britain, the United States, and France. The Foreign Ministers' Conference also decided that if the Austrian treaty had been concluded at that time, Austria should be allowed to attend as an observer.</p>

<p>[Associated Press, Seoul, 5th] Lieutenant General Hodge, commander of the U.S. occupation forces in Korea, explicitly rejected on the 5th the communist demand for the immediate withdrawal of U.S. troops from Korea. This request was made by the North-South Korean political conference initiated by the Soviet Union, which was recently held in Pyongyang, the capital of the Soviet-occupied area.

The voting result was 33 votes to 7.

U.S. representative Jessup supported the Cuban proposal. At the same time, the Trusteeship Council discussed the draft report to be submitted to the General Assembly on the efforts made to achieve a truce in the city of Jerusalem. The Council hoped that the efforts to achieve a truce in the entire city had failed, but the truce limited to the Old City had been agreed to by the Jewish representatives.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Jerusalem, 4th] Officials declared on the 4th: The British side has straightforwardly ordered that the ceasefire order in Jerusalem is still valid, even though the deadline has passed.</p>

<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 4th, Associated Press] Well-informed sources said: The Soviet Union has asked the United States to explain the reasons for its recent decision to step up the reconstruction of the Japanese economy. The Soviet representative to the Far Eastern Commission recently made a statement at a meeting of the Commission, saying that the United States should be more frank with its former allies and explain what it intends to do in Japan, and the reasons for taking such actions.</p>
<p>The reason why Soviet representative Panyushkin made such a statement is that U.S. officials recently said that the U.S. government intends to ask Congress to allocate a huge amount of funds as a fund for Japanese post-war undertakings. At the same time, it is heard that the United States will provide Japan with a large amount of raw material loans. Panyushkin did not ask the Far Eastern Commission to discuss actions related to this matter, but criticized the United States for distrusting the Far Eastern Commission. China, the Philippines, New Zealand, and Australia all supported the Soviet Union's position. They believe that the United States is currently planning to restore the Japanese economy, and the degree of restoration planned is also too large.</p>

<h3 id="e49">Senate Urgent Telegram to the National Economic Council: Public Utilities Must Not Be Allowed to Rise Again; Recommends Two Measures to Be Adopted and Implemented to Avoid Leading to a Continuous General Price Cycle <a href="#e49" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c49" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">49</a></h3>
<p>[This Newspaper] The Shanghai Municipal Senate previously stated that public utilities have repeatedly adjusted prices, stimulating general prices and greatly affecting people's livelihoods. It solemnly proposed discussions in the general assembly and subcommittee meetings and suggested that the central government stabilize the measures, but there has been no news so far. Recently, it was reported that coal prices have increased by 45% compared to the previous month's allocation price. Various public utilities in the city will also use the automatic adjustment formula due to the increase in coal prices and will be forced to re-adjust. Therefore, the Senate felt deeply anxious and sent an urgent telegram to the National Economic Council yesterday, stating the pros and cons and suggesting two points, the original text of which is as follows:</p>
<p>To the National Economic Council in Nanjing, we have recently heard that the city's coal price has been approved by the central government and increased by 45%, which will be implemented from May 1st. However, since the coal price is the main part of the cost of various public utilities, the prices of various public utilities will inevitably increase. The fact that public utilities lead to general price increases has been seen repeatedly in the past in this city and in various places. In recent months, the city's general prices have just stabilized. If public utility prices are adjusted again, they will stimulate prices and set off a general price increase. The situation is truly alarming. This council previously believed that stabilizing public utility prices is a prerequisite for suppressing general price increases, and that general price increases repeatedly affect the cost of public utilities, especially coal prices and foreign exchange. Therefore, at the fifth general assembly, Resolution No. 1 on Imminent Issues was drafted, and the Shanghai Municipal Government was requested to forward it to the central government. However, there has been no news for more than a month, which is deeply regrettable. Now that the price of public utilities directly and indirectly affects the national economy and people's livelihoods, if it is allowed to lead general prices, then in a cycle, this will rise and that will increase, and economic collapse will be inevitable. This council has witnessed the crisis and deeply felt the pain. Therefore, as the National Economic Council is about to convene a meeting to study this case, we will again submit our opinions in an urgent telegram: (1) Immediately stop applying the automatic adjustment formula to public utilities and transportation businesses. From May, there should be no further price increases. If the costs are insufficient, please ask the central government to restore the subsidy system. (2) If the subsidy system is temporarily difficult to implement, please ask the government to pre-allocate materials and fuels (such as coal, diesel, and gasoline) required by the business at the price of April for three months or pre-settle foreign exchange for three months. The above two points are deeply consistent with the established policy of the central government, and the factors causing the price increase of the business can be eliminated. It is hoped that the council will quickly make a decision and adopt and implement it. Sincerely, the Shanghai Municipal Senate.</p>

<h3 id="e57">Pirates in the Zhoushan Waters: The Communist Bandits Attempt to Incorporate Them; Police Officers in Disguise Go Deep Inside; Multiple Key Criminals Apprehended in Shanghai; Forgery of Customs Gold Unit Notes Also Cracked <a href="#e57" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c57" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">57</a></h3>
<p>[This Newspaper] On the morning of the 24th of last month, the City Police Bureau cracked a secret organization in the city that was attempting to incorporate Xu Xiaoyu's pirates in the Zhoushan waters of eastern Zhejiang. Li Huamin, "Chief of Staff of the Second Military Region of Central China" of the bandits, Wu (also known as Tao Niantang), "District Chief", and multiple pirate representatives were apprehended. At the same time, after searching, it was discovered that the organization was not only intending to endanger the city, but was also a forgery organization which intended to destabilize government finances by counterfeiting Customs Gold Unit notes. The case is still under investigation. The details of the cracking are as follows: In the Zhoushan waters of eastern Zhejiang, there are more than 300 pirates led by Xu Xiaoyu who appear from time to time to rob merchants. The number of victims are unknown. Recently, the pirates sent important cadres to Shanghai to contact Wu, the "District Chief" of the Communist bandits (also known as Tao Niantang), in an attempt to join forces and obtain assistance from the bandits. At that time, the City Police Bureau had learned of this intelligence, and immediately contacted inside lines for tracking and surveillance, and secretly sent police officers disguised as pirates to go deep inside. It was learned that Wu had sent the bandits Xu, Yang, Chen, etc. on April 10, carrying Wu's personal letter, to negotiate the incorporation with the pirate Ren. At the time, the pirates hoped that the Communist bandits would send more cadres to assist in the work and requested support of munitions. The Communist bandit representative Xu replied that the request would be reported to Wu, the "District Chief", for decision. On the 16th, the Communist bandit representative Yang and the pirate representative Ren held another meeting. Bandit Yang also said that Wu, the "District Chief", had set dinner with Ren that day (i.e., the 16th) at 4:00 p.m., agreeing to meet near the Golden Theatre. Wu came as expected, and Li Huamin, "Chief of Staff of the Second Military Region of Central China" of the bandits, participated in the matter. Wu fully agreed to the demands of the pirates, inquired in detail about the strength of the pirates, and said that after the inspection, he would transfer them to the higher echelons of the bandits for commissions and support. On the 23rd, the Communist bandits and pirates agreed to meet again in Zhongshan Park. The City Police Bureau, with the timing ripe, immediately took action, and arrested the key bandits Li Huamin, Wu, Bandit Yang Caiming, and the pirate representative Ren on the morning of that day. Based on the clues, Zhang Juemin, Chen Xixiang, and others were arrested. During the search of Wu's residence, the case workers found printing presses and paper for forging Customs Gold Unit notes. At the same time, forged thousand-yuan Customs Gold Unit notes totaling 940,000 yuan were found on the criminal's person. Later, based on the confession of Bandit Yang Caiming, forged banknotes totaling 6.4 million yuan and a machine for printing counterfeit banknotes were found in the home of the fugitive Jiang Yaofang. The police bureau will transfer the criminals to the Special Criminal Court for interrogation and will arrange the next action.</p>

<h3 id="e67">Former Director of the Executive Headquarters Suspected of Bigamy; Spouse Willing to Withdraw Lawsuit; District Prosecutor's Office Orders Further Inquiry <a href="#e67" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c67" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">67</a></h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Liu Shiqin, the former Director of the Executive Headquarters Supply Office, met and fell in love with Zhu Zhenyi, a female staff member of the office, in 1946. In March 1947, they began living together. In February of this year, Zhu went to her sister's place in Hong Kong to recuperate, and Liu followed her to Hong Kong. At Zhu's request, they held a wedding ceremony, signed a marriage certificate, and published a marriage announcement in the Sing Tao Daily. Later, they returned to Shanghai together and settled in No. 22, Maishai Lane, Xing'an Road. On the morning of the 8th of last month, Liu said he wanted to go to Songjiang to burn incense. Zhu wanted to go with him, but Liu refused. Zhu became suspicious and followed him to No. 4, Lane 264, Shanhai Pass Road. A young woman named Shu Xiuxia came out and claimed to be Liu's legal wife. A conflict broke out between the two sides, and Shu used a rattan cane to beat Zhu, causing Zhu to be injured. Zhu filed a complaint with the Lujiawan Police Station against Shu for assault and presented the marriage certificate and the Sing Tao Daily to prove that she and Liu were husband and wife. The police station told her, "Your injury is very minor. This matter is very trivial in itself, but your complaint has put your husband in the crime of bigamy, do you know that?" Zhu replied, "I didn't know." Then, Liu was summoned for questioning. Liu confessed, "Zhu originally knew that I had a legal wife. She lived with me voluntarily. The cause of this matter was that I had previously lived with a young woman named Lou Caizhu. Lou has passed away, leaving behind a few pieces of jewelry. Zhu asked me for them, and I refused, which led to the conflict. As for marrying Zhu in Hong Kong, it was entirely due to my affection for her and to save face for her sister in Hong Kong. Now I know I was wrong." Shu Xiuxia said, "I married Liu in 1930. Zhu knew about it. I want to sue Zhu for hindering family harmony and adultery." Based on the above statements, the police station listed both Liu and Zhu as defendants, accusing them of "hindering family harmony" and "adultery," and transferred them to the District Prosecutor's Office for investigation. Yesterday, Prosecutor Ding Tongjun summoned the defendants Liu Shiqin and Zhu Zhenyi, and the person involved, Shu Xiuxia. Liu and Zhu both said, "Although we signed a marriage certificate, we did not hold a public ceremony." Shu said, "I am willing to withdraw the lawsuit." The prosecutor believed that whether this case constituted bigamy was still under investigation and immediately ordered Liu and Zhu to remain on bail, and Shu was ordered to return home, and the inquiry would be held again at a later date.</p>

<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Chen Binjuan, a woman from Pudong, resides at No. 14, Lane 245, Julu Road. She is over forty years old and has been a broker for jewelry and diamonds for many years. She is often seen in the mansions of high-ranking officials and dignitaries, and as a result, she has accumulated considerable wealth. Years ago, she bought a car for transportation and lived extravagantly, which aroused the covetousness of criminals. At around 2:00 PM on the 3rd, Chen returned to her residence from the jewelry market. As she was about to get out of the car at the entrance of Fuhai Lane on Julu Road, three thugs who had been lying in wait suddenly rushed out from the side of the road, blocked the car with guns, threatened the driver Ju Zhicai (from Nantong), and forbade him to make a sound, forcing Chen to get back into the car. Two thugs also sat in the passenger compartment, and another thug drove the car westward along Lin Sen Road, through Ferguson Road and Hongqiao Road, to the desolate suburbs of Fahua.</p>
<p>The area was sparsely populated. After the car stopped, the thugs ordered Chen Binjuan to hand over her valuables. Chen refused, and they struck her head violently with the butt of a pistol, rendering her unconscious. The two thugs then began to search and robbed her of a "treasure bag" from her abdomen. They then got out of the car one after another, jumped onto a public bus, and fled. The driver woke up the mistress and drove back to the nest. Upon checking the lost items, it was found that a total of nine medium-sized diamonds, weighing about four carats in total, a red ruby ring with small diamonds, two sapphire rings with small diamonds, a small diamond-studded jade butterfly brooch, a two-carat round diamond ring, two sapphire rings, an octagonal gold-set jade green piece weighing about 30 grams, a platinum-set diamond brooch, a rectangular diamond, a finely rounded pearl weighing about five or six points, a pair of five-carat thick diamonds, two large jadeite oval rings (gold-set), and another one (platinum-set), a six-carat heavy yellow thick diamond, a large hexagonal sapphire, a rose gold diamond-studded women's watch, and another women's watch, a large hexagonal sapphire, a pair of small sapphire heart-shaped diamond-studded loops, and many other valuable ornaments were lost. In short, the total weight of the diamonds in this case is about 430 carats. According to market prices, it is worth more than 50-60 billion yuan. After the incident, Chen reported it to the Lujiawan Police Station. After receiving the report, Police Chief Song personally led Inspector Ni Jiafeng and several plainclothes police officers to pursue the robbers in all directions. Later, a large diamond ring and a pearl necklace were found in Chen's car. The next day, through the efforts of Inspector Ni and others, another two-carat diamond ring and other parts of the stolen goods were recovered. Police Chief Song attached great importance to this major robbery case, ordered all criminal police officers to strictly pursue the robbers, and set a deadline for solving the case.</p>

<h3 id="e78">The Seventh National Games Grandly Opened; More Than 100,000 Spectators at the Venue; Throngs of People, Not a Single Empty Seat in the Stands <a href="#e78" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c78" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">78</a></h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The opening ceremony of the Seventh National Games was grandly held yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM at the Municipal Stadium amidst the cheers of the crowd. Jiangwan Road was crowded with vehicles all day long, and spectators surged like a tide. The stands around the venue were packed with people, and there was not a single empty seat. Many spectators arrived as early as the morning, bringing dry food, tea, and water to reserve seats in advance. Those who arrived later had almost no place to stand. It is estimated that there were more than 100,000 spectators at the venue. The bright red national flags and white Games flags fluttered in the wind on the walls of the stadium. The various colored flags and costumes inside and outside the venue competed for beauty, forming a sea of colors, like waves rising and falling, making it a spectacular sight. The weather was clear and bright, and the gentle sunshine added a lot of color to the conference. The presidium was located on the west command platform. From 2:00 PM onwards, leaders from all walks of life and foreign guests arrived one after another. At 2:49 PM, the Beijing-Shanghai Torch Relay long-distance run reached the finish line. Sixty-six student athletes from Jiaotong University, holding eleven torches high, entered the stadium through the gate of the East Command Platform. Cheers erupted from the four stands and lasted for a long time. The torch team crossed the stadium and went straight to the west command platform, climbing the steps on both sides to the front of the rostrum. Wang Nancun, the student athlete who received the last leg, handed over the head of state's message to Mayor Wu. The team members then stepped up to the portrait of Dr. Sun Yat-sen and the national flag, placed the torches in the pre-arranged wooden frames, and withdrew. This great Beijing-Shanghai long-distance torch relay was thus completed. The raging flames burned high in front of Dr. Sun Yat-sen's portrait, fully displaying the brave spirit of our Chinese men.</p>
<p>After three bell rings, athletes from all over the country marched into the venue in formation to the sound of military music and circled the track. The procession was led by a military band. In the front was the Games flag, followed by the Guizhou team, the Indonesian team, the Qingdao team, the Gansu team, the Anhui team, the Shandong team, the Army team, the Taiwan team, the Fujian team, the Jiangxi team, the Shanxi team, the Hankou team, the Air Force team, the Zhejiang team, the Philippines team, the Nanjing team, the Tianjin team, the Jiangsu team, the Sichuan team, the Chongqing team, the Shaanxi team, the Hebei team, the Liaoning team, the Andong team, the Liaobei team, the Jilin team, the Songjiang team, the Hejiang team, the Heilongjiang team, the Nenjiang team, the Xing'an team, the Harbin team, the Shenyang team, the Police team, the Hunan team, the Beiping team, the Xi'an team, the Malayan Chinese team, the Joint Logistics team, the Saigon team, the Hong Kong team, the Hubei team, the Rehe team, the Henan team, the Guangxi team, the Navy team, the Guangdong team, the Guangzhou team, the Honolulu team, the Xinjiang team, the Siam team, the Xikang team, and finally the Shanghai team, a total of 53 teams with more than 2,000 athletes, all of whom were energetic and heroic, and their costumes were neat and beautiful. For example, the uniforms of the Army, Navy, and Air Force, the fiery red of the Indonesian team, the pure white of the Taiwan team, the yellow khaki of the Northeast representatives, and the green and white interweaving of the Hubei male athletes. The colors were varied and each had its own characteristics. Applause rose and fell in the venue. When the Northeast representatives, overseas Chinese representatives, and Xinjiang representatives passed by, the audience gave them even warmer cheers. After completing the lap, all the athletes lined up in the center of the field in columns, facing the west command platform.</p>
<p>At 3:37 PM, the ceremony began. After playing music and saluting, Zhang Boling, President of Nankai University, first respectfully read the head of state's message (full text in yesterday's newspaper), followed by speeches by Zhu Jiahua, President of the Games, and Wu Guozhen, Vice President of the Games (see below), and the athlete representatives taking the oath. Finally, everyone shouted slogans: "Long live the National Games! Long live President Chiang! Long live the Republic of China!" At this time, an airplane from this newspaper and three other airplanes in the sky above the venue distributed leaflets. For a while, the colors of red and green were intertwined, and cheers rang out. The newspaper also released a thousand homing pigeons into the venue. As the flocks of wings passed, the audience applauded in waves. The mood of the entire conference can be said to be excited and enthusiastic. It is a pity that the air force parachute performance, which was originally scheduled, was temporarily announced to be canceled due to the strong winds at high altitude, which was a bit of a disappointment.</p>

<p>After the ceremony, a mass group exercise of 6,000 people was held. The participants were from 52 schools, divided into 88 groups, arranged in neat columns. Under the general command of Zhang Juefei, the chief referee of the Games, and accompanied by the music of the Children's Orchestra of the Municipal Children's Education Center, they performed neat and magnificent calisthenics. All the male and female students participating in the performance were wearing white tops, blue shorts, and white shoes. When the ranks moved forward, it was like white waves rolling in a blue sea. The audience praised this beautiful picture. After the exercises began, the rhythm was harmonious, and the advances and retreats were orderly. When the dancers raised their hands, they were like flocks of seagulls flying in formation, and when they lowered their heads, they were like sheep grazing. The melody of youth and the beauty of large group cooperation were fully expressed here. The audience's applause was incessant. The opening ceremony of the National Games came to a successful conclusion at 4:45 PM.</p>

<p>In his speech at the opening ceremony of the Games, Minister of Education Zhu Jiahua said: "The Seventh National Games were originally scheduled to be held in 1937, but were suspended due to the outbreak of the Anti-Japanese War. Now that the Anti-Japanese War has been won, I am very pleased that we can open it in Shanghai today. The lineup of this Games is better than in previous Games. For example, Taiwan, which has been separated from the motherland for fifteen years, and the Northeast, which has been invaded by barbarians for fourteen years, have representatives here today. There are also more overseas units than before. The police and the military can also form their own units. All of this is enough to add to the characteristics of the Games. In ancient times, our country's education always emphasized the combination of literary and martial arts. In modern times, due to the lack of attention to physical education, the people's bodies have become weak and the country has faced many disasters. Since the establishment of the National Government, we have been trying our best to promote physical education in order to strengthen the people and the country. The spirit of a sportsman must be to strive for victory in harmony. Do not be arrogant in victory, and do not be discouraged in defeat. In particular, we should pay attention to cooperation, disregard personal success or failure, and take care of the glory of the whole. The 14th World Games will be held in London soon. I hope that this Games will have good results, so that our athletes can also compete with the athletes of other countries in the world. I also hope that we can learn from each other in a spirit of cooperation and spread this spirit to the people, so as to transform social customs and revive the nation and the country. Finally, I wish all athletes to work hard, be healthy, and succeed."</p>
<h3 id="e81">Mayor Wu's Speech: Holding the National Games on Schedule is the Greatest Miracle <a href="#e81" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c81" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">81</a></h3>
<p>Mayor Wu stated in his speech: "It is a great honor for the 7th National Games to be held in Shanghai. However, due to limited funding, environmental constraints, and the urgency of time, the hospitality may be lacking, which I deeply regret. However, in these times of internal strife and national depletion, the fact that the National Games can be held on schedule is already the greatest miracle. Firstly, I should thank the enthusiastic assistance of the people of the whole country. I believe that the Republic of China will surely have a prosperous future. Secondly, I thank the enthusiastic individuals in the sports community from all over the country. Thirdly, I thank the efforts of Director-General Hao of the Games, which have enabled the Games to be held smoothly. Finally, I hope that all athletes will forgive any shortcomings in the hospitality."</p>

<p>Notice from the Transportation Section of the National Games: (1) The Transportation Section hopes that all vehicles and spectators will abide by traffic control rules during the Games. (2) The starting point of the special Route 4 transportation, originally scheduled from Pingliang Road and Lan Road to the venue, will be changed from the Tilanqiao triangular area starting from the 6th. (3) For all special transportation buses, the original plan was to disembark at the east grandstand and board at the west grandstand. From the 6th onward, in addition to disembarking still at the east grandstand, boarding will be changed to simultaneously board in front of both the east and west grandstand entrances.</p>

<p>Malayan Team Uniforms are the Most Beautiful</p>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] On the opening day of the 7th National Games, the weather was sunny and the breeze gentle. Jiangwan Road was bustling with activity. It is estimated that the number of spectators was close to 100,000, setting the highest record in history.</p>
<p>Each delegation has a uniform. The Guizhou team led the way, and the Shanghai team brought up the rear. The Honolulu athletes were the fewest, numbering only three, but their colorful Hawaiian shirts were the most eye-catching.</p>
<p>The Indonesian uniforms have the most beautiful colors, with blue-green tops and light pink trousers. The Philippine uniforms are taupe, and the female athletes all wear mid-heeled shoes.</p>
<p>The most exquisite material for the uniforms undoubtedly belongs to the Malayan delegation, which consists of fine gray flannel, pure wool ties, and red "Malayan Chinese" lettering, for both men and women.</p>
<p>The Malayan Chinese team also printed a large number of "7th National Games Special Edition" publications, which are beautifully printed and rich in content. It is said that the cost per copy is one million national currency. The team leader distributed them to reporters and distinguished guests at the venue, making them the most generous at the event.</p>
<p>The small round caps of the Xinjiang athletes are quite admirable. There were many who pointed and commented, and many of the female athletes were of mixed race, with golden hair.</p>
<p>The biggest problem was transportation. The number of vehicles was impossible to count. During the opening and closing of the Games, the roads were congested. Some estimated that the speed of the cars was slower than that of rickshaws, and that rickshaws were slower than bicycles. (Talent)</p>

<p>[Report from this newspaper] Wu Guozhen, Chairman of the Organizing Committee of the National Games, arrived at the resting room of the swimming pool at the venue at 10:00 am on the 5th to discuss with Hao Gengsheng, Director-General of the National Games, how to make the facilities at the venue more adequate. The originally planned meeting of the heads of each group was cancelled because the heads of each group were busy inspecting all parts of the venue to solve various problems on the spot. They first walked to the front of the gate, then to the venue, and then to the roads surrounding the venue, to find the people in charge of the reception, general affairs, and ticketing groups. They gave instructions on the spot that traffic and vendors needed to be regulated, and that a large map of the venue should be posted in front of the gate, and that signs should be widely set up. Tickets should specify the date, when the opening ceremony will be held, and when the competitions will be held, all of which should be announced in advance. After giving instructions, Chairman of the Organizing Committee got into his car and returned to the Municipal Government to work.</p>

<p>[Report from this newspaper] Yesterday was the last day of the Beijing-Shanghai Torch Relay Race. The fourteen members of the seventh team were responsible for the 42-kilometer run between Taicang and Zhenru. At 7:22 a.m., Yang Dajun, holding the torch high, set off from Taicang first. Prior to this, people from all walks of life in Taicang gathered at the station to see them off. Yu Baorui and Wang Ruiying were temporarily appointed to present a banner reading "Accumulate Health to Achieve Strength", which was accepted by Wang Tiesheng on behalf of the team. They also presented a torch as a souvenir. After the departure, the entire seventh team accompanied Yang for a short run, and then took turns passing the torch. The Taicang mounted police team escorted them along the way. The weather was sunny and the breeze gentle. The wheat ears along the road were heavy with grain, and the villagers gathered in groups of three or five, eagerly watching the athletes. The team members ran swiftly amidst excited cheers. At 7:58 a.m., the third runner, Zhao Guoping, arrived at Gelong Town in Jiading County.</p>
<p>Zhou Mingxing, the county magistrate of Jiading, Hu Jinwen, the director of the police bureau, the heads of various townships, and the self-defense corps, accompanied the athletes throughout their passage through Jiading County. They first waited in Gelong and then rushed to the Hujia Wood Bridge on the border of Shanghai and Jiading to see them off. The athletes passed through Waigang Town at 8:13 a.m. and arrived at the West Gate of Jiading at 8:43 a.m. The people along the way spontaneously gathered to welcome them. The line stretched for several miles. Tang Daleng, a female student from Lianxi National Primary School in Jiading County, presented flowers on behalf of the school. Yang Dayaoyao, a female student from the county high school, presented a banner reading "Self-Improvement" on behalf of the Liming Sports Association. Miss Wang Caixia also presented flowers on behalf of the team. Zhou, the county magistrate of Jiading, also presented a banner reading "Passing on the Torch", which was accepted by Jin Daji and Zhao Bilan on behalf of the team. The atmosphere was enthusiastic, and the applause resounded through the clouds.</p>
<p>At 9:40 a.m., Qiao Feng strode into Nanxiang. More than a thousand students and people from Xianggong Public School, the Central National School, the Huai Shao Education Institute, and the Dade Elementary School lined up to welcome them. Huai Shao presented a horizontal banner reading "Faster than Postal Service to Deliver the Message", and Misses Wang Jinfeng and Sun Xiujuan from Dade Elementary School presented a flower basket on behalf of the school. Cheers rose one after another, creating an unprecedented spectacle.</p>
<p>Entering the City, Viewers Block the Streets</p>
<p>At 10:18 a.m., Shen Beizhang, the last runner of the seventh team, ran into the Shanghai urban area. The entire team then joined the run. At 10:35 a.m., they arrived at Zhenru. The Road Construction Machinery Training Office of the Highway Administration had prepared refreshments and other consolation items in advance, which were distributed immediately. At noon, they also treated the members of the seventh and eighth teams to lunch. At the same time, the office specially sent staff to measure the exact route and distance from Zhenru to the venue during the team's break. The result was that the entire journey was determined to be 20 kilometers, which would be run by ten people, each running 2,000 meters in ten minutes. Therefore, it was decided to depart after 1:30 p.m.</p>
<p>After further discussion, it was believed that the traffic conditions along the way were not perfect, and that the estimated time could not be maintained. Therefore, the departure was temporarily advanced to 1:00 p.m. Nearby residents learned that this section was the final section of the entire journey, and that the opening ceremony of the Games was waiting for the runners to arrive. For a moment, everyone followed the runners, and the bicycle procession reached more than 200 bicycles.</p>
<p>Resting and Waiting, Striding into the Venue</p>
<p>The eighth team was led by Liu Zhenzhong, who passed the torch in order. Amidst the surging crowd, the lead car, the command car, the escort car, the follow-up car, and the reporter car advanced slowly in two rows, attracting tens of thousands of people on both sides of the railway to move and cheer. The procession passed through Qiujiang Road, North Sichuan Road, the intersection of Wusong Road, Jiulong Road, and the Jiaxing Road Bridge, heading straight for Qimei Road. No less than tens of thousands of people stood and watched along the way. The athletes ran excitedly amidst the sound of firecrackers, and their pace was extremely fast. They arrived at the Wujiaochang roundabout before 2:00 p.m. Because it was still early before the opening ceremony, the entire team had to stand by the roadside and wait.</p>
<p>As the bell rang at 3:00 p.m., the sixty-six runners of the relay race team were divided into two rows. The first eleven runners each held a torch, led by Wang Nancun. Under the expectation of tens of thousands of spectators, they entered the venue through the east grandstand gate, ascended the west grandstand, and respectfully presented the Head of State's message to the Games Chairman. The music was melodious, and the atmosphere was solemn. This historical mission symbolizing the spirit of the National Games was declared complete amidst applause.</p>

<p>[Report from this newspaper] To celebrate the opening of the 7th National Games, this newspaper distributed celebration leaflets by plane over the Games yesterday afternoon and released carrier pigeons. The plane distributing leaflets was a joint effort between this newspaper and the Central Air Transport Corporation. The Central Air Transport Corporation specially dispatched an XTT21 passenger plane, carrying three reporters and photographers from this newspaper, which arrived over the Games at the time when the torch conveying the President's message arrived at the venue. The plane circled the venue six times, dropping 50,000 red celebration leaflets. The photographer from this newspaper also took shots of the Games from the air. The plane was flown by Director He Shourong and Chief Pilot Hong Qiming of the Central Air Transport Corporation and was the largest of the planes distributing leaflets yesterday.</p>
<p>The carrier pigeon performance was organized in cooperation with the China Victory Carrier Pigeon Association. It was solemnly held yesterday afternoon at 3:30 p.m. after the opening ceremony of the Games. Early in the morning at 8:00 a.m., this newspaper specially prepared two carrier pigeon vans, which went to the locations of the various members to collect the pigeons. At around 12:00 noon, more than a thousand pigeons raised by more than thirty members were gathered, divided into more than forty cages. At 2:30 p.m., the vans entered the southern end of the venue from the west grandstand and were placed in order. The members then tied colorful slogans and ribbons around the pigeons' necks and released them simultaneously. The second segment was a collective flight, soaring high into the sky, creating a spectacular sight. The flight lasted for half an hour before it was completed. More than a thousand pigeons circled the venue several times and flew back to their old nests.</p>

<p>Information from the Games Security Group: The Second Fire Brigade (Shanghai North District Private Fire Brigade) of the Games Security Group Special Duty Brigade has started duty, consisting of seven squads. The headquarters of the brigade is located under the east grandstand of the Games, with a dedicated telephone number: (02) 55-59 branch.</p>

<p>To promote the spirit of social service, this newspaper has set up a temporary office to the east of the east grandstand of the Games. The main business has been detailed in yesterday's newspaper. Yesterday was the first day of the Games opening ceremony. Spectators gathered at the door of the office, and those admiring the National Games photos blocked the way. The sale of photos was also very busy, creating a feeling of being overwhelmed like on Shanyin Road.</p>
<p>A giant thermometer, as tall as a person, hangs at the door of this newspaper's office. Passers-by stop to watch; their faces are smiling, as if they are placing unlimited hope in the recent sunny weather.</p>
<p>A gentleman from the Gansu Provincial Delegation was very interested in the various secret photos displayed by this newspaper and proposed that the photographic reporter of this newspaper take activity photos on their behalf. A gentleman from the Philippine Overseas Chinese Delegation ordered photos of the Philippine delegation taken during the Games, regardless of size, two of each type, to keep as souvenirs.</p>
<p>[Ma Yujun Seeks Old Friend] Ma Yujun from the Shandong Province referee group is looking for his old friend, Mr. Hu Zongfan. It is said that Mr. Hu is a Shanghai sports reporter. It is hoped that Mr. Hu and his relatives will relay the message to Mr. Ma after seeing the newspaper.</p>

<p>[Report from this newspaper] This time, the special broadcast van sent by this newspaper accompanied the Beijing-Shanghai Torch Relay Race for interviews and broadcasting along the way. It worked hard for four days and was extremely well received by all parties. Yesterday morning, the special van followed Mi Hu from Taicang under the leadership of Liu Jianqu, a special correspondent from this newspaper. The special van of this newspaper met on the way and arrived at the venue together. After broadcasting the latest news for the last time in front of the Games gate, the mission was declared complete.</p>
<h3 id="e92">Starlight <a href="#e92" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c92" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">92</a></h3>
<p>Dozens of members of the torch relay race team rested at the Zhenru Telegraph Bureau yesterday afternoon. The bureau was the old site of Jinan University. Local men, women, old, and young flocked to see the heroes.</p>
<p>The photographer inside the bureau rushed to get a shot. Suddenly, a certain athlete set off a firecracker, creating a deafening sound. The photographer was greatly startled.</p>
<p>Shen Beizhang is a basketball star from Jiaotong University. His body is slightly chubby, and the distance he ran was relatively long. Therefore, after he completed his mission, everyone said "You worked hard!"</p>
<p>At 11:30 a.m., the Highway Administration provided lunch. It seemed that they emphasized "quantity" rather than "quality".</p>
<p>The last section started with Liu Zhenzhong. At 1:00 p.m., they departed from Zhenru. The athletes were particularly excited, and their speed was faster than usual. Moreover, because they departed too early, they only arrived at the Wujiaochang roundabout around 2:00 p.m.</p>
<p>When the long-distance running team arrived in Shanghai, the roads they passed were deserted. There were applause and cheers, and the sound of firecrackers was endless. At the intersection of Qiujiang Road and North Sichuan Road, the Boy Scout Band of Jianhua Voluntary Elementary School played music to show their respect.</p>
<p>The students from Jiaotong University gathered at Wujiaochang in the city center. Led by Wang Nancun, holding a torch, the sixty athletes ran into the National Games venue, delivering the Head of State's message and completing a major task.</p>
<p>Eleven torches are hanging high on the grandstand of the venue, in front of the portrait of Sun Yat-sen. Symbolizing the bright and splendid future of the National Games.</p>

<p>Car thefts, stolen parts and tires have been discovered "Be careful first."</p>
<p>Those who bought tickets could not enter the venue, while those without tickets crowded in. The "Flying Fortress" was not well received on both sides.</p>
<p>People who could not find a way to enter the venue peeked through the cracks in the bamboo fence and billboards, watching the Western spectacle. Some even found rattan chairs to sit on, feeling extremely comfortable.</p>
<p>Ladies and gentlemen coming out of the venue had white leather shoes turned into black leather shoes, and black leather shoes turned into gray leather shoes.</p>
<p>Today seems like Air Force Day. Airplanes were competing in the sky, diving and soaring. Leaflets were flying everywhere, so people were snatching and grabbing, like picking up banknotes.</p>

<h3 id="e95">Soccer War Opens: Zhejiang Wins Against Philippines; Scores Three Times in Extra Time; Air Force Easily Defeats Hankou 5-1 <a href="#e95" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c95" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">95</a></h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] Although the opening ceremony of the National Games was solemnly held yesterday afternoon in full view of the public, the real curtain-raiser took place in the morning at the soccer fields of Yiyuan and Shanghai University.</p>
<p>At Yiyuan, there were two matches: Air Force vs. Hankou, and Zhejiang vs. Philippines. In the first match, the experience of both the Air Force and Hankou teams was slightly lacking. However, the Air Force, under the guidance of the renowned Dai Linjing, had better coordination, and ultimately won with a score of 5-1. In the second match, the skills of both sides were evenly matched. The Philippines was initially strong but later weakened. Goalkeeper Ke Tengjing gave a brilliant performance, but Zhejiang eventually turned defeat into victory with a score of 6-3.</p>
<p>Air Force vs. Hankou Match</p>
<p>The first match began at exactly 9:00 AM. The Air Force chose to play with the sun in their faces. At 10 minutes, Air Force's Mai Runming crossed the ball, and Liang Guangzhen gently tapped it into the bottom of the Hankou net, opening the scoring. After that, the back-and-forth exchanges saw both sides make some mistakes. At 25 minutes, Air Force's Mai Runming took a corner kick. Suddenly, a long whistle blew from the crowd, as someone from Hankou had handled the ball. Air Force's Tian Rongfa took the penalty kick and scored, making it 2-0. Five minutes later, Air Force's Liang Guangzhen, receiving several excellent passes from Tian Rongfa, continuously scored two goals. At the end of the first half, the scoreboard showed the Air Force impressively leading 4-0.</p>
<p>In the second half, Hankou's goalkeeper Tan Hancheng replaced Ye Tao. After the change, the Air Force launched a full-scale attack. Unexpectedly, a ball was shot from the crowd, but Tan Hancheng calmly caught it. However, the Hankou team's defensive line was under constant threat. At 15 minutes, the Air Force's forward line made several clear short passes, and the ball once again entered the Hankou team's territory. Lan Baotian kicked the ball high, and it went straight into the net, making it 5-0. After that, although the Hankou team had several opportunities to attack the Air Force's goal, their coordination was poor, and several attempts were abandoned halfway, failing to achieve success. In the last five minutes, the ball lingered in front of the Air Force's goal. Hankou's Chen Zixiu kicked the ball, hitting Liu Baolin's upper leg and bouncing into the corner of the Air Force's goal. The scoreboard showed 5-1, saving Hankou from a shutout.</p>

<p>Zhejiang vs. Philippines Match</p>
<p>The second match started at 10:30 AM. The Philippines team chose the field, and Zhejiang kicked off. The two teams exchanged passes politely. With several long kicks and short passes, the footwork was crisp and sharp, sweeping away the sluggishness of the first match. Within 15 minutes, Zhejiang made three dangerous attacks, but all were saved by the Philippines' Ke Tengjing. The Philippines team was unwilling to be outdone. Lin Luowan led the troops to attack, and Chen Zhujun passed perfectly. Shi Bingshan lifted his foot and slammed the ball straight into the bottom of the Zhejiang net. However, misfortunes never come singly. Capitalizing on the momentum of their initial goal, the Philippines team continued to wreak havoc on the Zhejiang defensive line. The forward line made high-speed passes. With Shi Bingshan closely guarded, a ball was lobbed to Lin Luowan, who did not disappoint, scoring another goal, making it 2-0. At that time, Zhejiang replaced right-back Fei Chunlin with Xu Sheng yuan. At 30 minutes, Zhejiang's Wu Binghao retaliated with a long-range shot. The ball entered the goal from the upper left corner, leaving Ke Tengjing helpless. Having learned from this lesson, Tengjing guarded against the ball's trajectory, carefully watching his position. Sure enough, Su Ziwen made several diagonal shots, but Tengjing calmly jumped up to save them, turning danger into safety. As the first half was about to end, Philippines' Lin Luowan connected... the ball flew out as fast as a flat cannon shot, and... followed closely... making it Philippines 3, Zhejiang 1.</p>
<p>(The rest of this section is too damaged to translate accurately.)</p>
<p>During the half, the Philippines team was exhausted and in a completely passive position. Four minutes later, Zhejiang's Zhang Jie scored first, followed by Lu Qingxiang and others, who added two more goals, sealing the victory. If not for Ke Tengjing's efforts, the Philippines team would have lost by at least ten goals.</p>

<h3 id="e96">Liaoning United Not Strong; Dalian Wins Easily <a href="#e96" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c96" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">96</a></h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] The Dalian soccer team defeated Liaoning United with a brave performance yesterday, resulting in a score of 2-0. If Dalian's forwards could have been less weak in front of the goal, they could have won by at least half a dozen goals. During the 70 minutes of chaotic battle, although the total number of goals scored by both sides was only two, the situation was almost one-sided. Liaoning United was constantly under pressure due to their relatively weak strength.</p>
<p>The match was held in the large sports field, and the order was quite chaotic. In the end, almost all the spectators entered the field.</p>
<p>At 5:30 PM, the match began. Dalian kicked off first, and immediately launched a full-scale attack, with dangerous situations constantly arising in front of the Liaoning United goal. However, Dalian's forwards missed many opportunities because their shots in front of the goal were either too high or their footwork was slow and powerless. Liaoning United's goalkeeper made frequent saves amidst the chaos, which was really painstaking. After 35 minutes of fierce fighting, neither side scored in the first half.</p>
<p>Switching sides to fight again, Dalian's offensive was still strong. After five minutes of contact, they flanked the attack from the left, lobbing the ball in front of the goal. Yan Chengkuan seized the opportunity from the crowd and kicked the ball slowly into the net, opening the scoring. After that, Dalian still had several good chances, but they all went over the bar.</p>
<p>More than six minutes later, Dalian won a corner kick opportunity. Jiang Benshen kicked it perfectly, but the goalkeeper jumped up to meet it and missed. Chen Chaofu arrived in time and tapped it in, making it 2-0.</p>
<p>After that, although Liaoning United attacked once, they were unsuccessful. After a long and arduous battle, time ran out, and Dalian will face Guangdong on the 7th.</p>

<p>[Our Dispatch] In yesterday morning's two preliminary soccer matches at Shanghai University, the Army defeated Qingdao 1-0, and Guangdong overwhelmed Henan, with Henan's poor performance resulting in a 4-0 shutout.</p>
<p>Army vs. Qingdao Match</p>
<p>The Army vs. Qingdao match began at 9:05 AM. Army's Zhang Jinhai did not play, and Qu Yongfu took his place as center forward, with his vacant position filled by Zhang Renyi. On the Qingdao side, goalkeeper Yang Yongsen only watched from the sidelines, and center-back Liu Wenxue temporarily acted as the goalkeeper. With a whistle from the referee, the battle began. The Army attacked first, but the forward line dribbled too much, and good opportunities were often missed. At five minutes, Gao Xiuqing took a shot from the penalty spot, but it was saved by Liu Wenxue. Qingdao counter-attacked, and Zhang Jiliang and Sheng Dexin entered together, but were blocked by Wu Qixiang. After a long period of fierce fighting, although the Army's offensive was strong, their forwards lacked shooting skills, and their passing was often sluggish. In addition, Qingdao's defenders were able to run and fight. The Army soldiers had the problem of "a rat pulling a turtle, unable to start." The first half ended in chaos, with no goals scored.</p>
<p>At the start of the second half, Qingdao continued with its original lineup. After six minutes, Army's Gu Yisa entered the field, replacing Zhang Renyi. Qu Yongfu retreated to midfield, and Gao Xiuqing was reassigned as center forward. After the forward line was adjusted, the offensive became even stronger. However, after 28 minutes of battle, the two armies were fighting in front of the Qingdao goal. The Army won a corner kick opportunity, which was taken by Fei Chunhua. Qu Yongfu took a clear shot and hit the left corner, establishing the foundation for victory. After that, although Qingdao tried to counter-attack, the Army's two Wus and one Meng were sitting in the back, as solid as a rock. In the end, the Army eliminated Qingdao with a score of 1-0.</p>

<p>The Guangdong vs. Henan match followed. Led by Hou Chengtuo, the "Thunderbolt" team took the offensive first. The Henan team was weaker and only had the ability to parry. In the first half, Guangdong won by three goals. (1) Ma Xian got a response from Hou Chengtuo, picked it over Chai Juzhen, and slipped past Guan Xinyou, and shot low into the net with his right foot, clear and beautiful. (2) Ma Qunxian got Chen Rongzhi's high pass, and before the ball fell, he whipped his leg and slammed the ball into the net. (3) Five minutes before the end of the first half, Liu Xuezi got the opportunity at 15 yards and shot low into the goal.</p>
<p>Switching sides to fight again, Guangdong continued with its remaining strength, attacking incessantly. After five minutes, Liu Xuezi picked a shot into the right corner from near the goal. Wang Tianze used his hands and feet together to block it, but the ball had already rolled past the white line. Zhang Jimin hurriedly hooked it out, but the referee did not see it, avoiding the disaster. At 15 minutes, Lin Qiquan lobbed the ball in the left wing, and Hou Chengtuo dribbled and passed it into the left corner, making it 4-0. After that, Guangdong continued to control the whole game, but they had already scored a lot, so they did not go too far. When the final whistle blew, they won by four goals.</p>

<p>[Our Dispatch] In the men's basketball preliminary round, only one match was held yesterday: Rehe vs. Qingdao, which took place at 5:00 PM in the first basketball court. The audience was quite crowded. The referees were Zheng Zhifang and Wang Yiyi.</p>
<p>After the start of the game, Qingdao's right forward Cheng Jianing scored several consecutive goals, taking a 4-0 lead. Rehe's left guard Ma Xifeng then scored, and the situation gradually became balanced. Qingdao's Cheng Jianing was accurate with his shots, and center Yu Dehai and left guard Yang Yongsen, two tall players, were good at using their height to intercept the opponent's passes, gaining many advantages. In the first half, Qingdao took a 16-10 lead.</p>
<p>The Rehe team's coordination was not weak, but they could not find an effective way to attack, nor did they fully utilize the human tactical strategy. Individually, Ma Xifeng and Wang Pingzhou were more outstanding. In the second half, they once forced the score to 18-15, but it was a flash in the pan. Qingdao's Cheng and Yu repeatedly scored, and they took a commanding lead again with 42-27. Although Rehe quickly caught up, it was too late. The final score was 42-38, and Qingdao won.</p>
<p>Qingdao always fought with five players, so that in the last minute, Jia Minqing was fouled out and replaced by Li Shiyun. With Qingdao's victory, they advanced to the next game, and tomorrow they will compete with Malaya for the right to play in the quarter-finals. The scores of the two teams in yesterday's game are as follows:</p>

<p>— Our Reporter Hu Jiangchang</p>
<p>[Our Special Report] Field events have been barren in the country for more than ten years. On the eve of the opening of the 7th National Games, a casual discussion on the general trend of field events, speculating on who will win the championship, can only be said to be a bold attempt.</p>
<p>For example, in the past 17 years, some veteran field athletes have passed away, such as Fu Bao... and Hua Suian; some have died, such as Chen...qiu; some have retired, and some have unexpectedly left the field event arena. However, most of these field event... features... to give us some shadows... that... from various places... results.</p>
<p>How accurate are these results? Under what kind of atmosphere and weather conditions were they...? What...? What about the sand and soil...? Do the various have...?……all this…。　　　　　　　　　　　Real results. Also, an arena and a good hand, therefore, occupy Luo...shan. A...get well and create....</p>
<p>Moreover, glancing at the preliminary results from various places, there are not many men's events in field events that have broken national records. In this case, several teams with similar strength, such as Taiwan, Fujian, Shanghai, Navy, Army, and Air Force, seem to be dark horses, and everyone has the potential to take the lead.</p>
<p>Men's</p>
<p>Taiwan Not Difficult to Win the Championship</p>
<p>First, let's talk about men's field events. Taiwan, after the restoration, came with excellent double jumps (long jump, triple jump) and three... records, sending out all their troops. Moreover, each item has the strength... four to participate in the competition, between... the standard... thing. But the Air Force's three... also... the Navy's along the line... of course, is Taiwan's strong enemy. - The team... average, below... People... results balance, if can... strive for some of the top four seats in each event, then... the score, is also... considerable.</p>
<p>Below, I still... In Taiwanese athletes, the double... and the long jump and the triple jump. The old general of Taiwanese athletics, Zhang... Xian, once had the result of 7.28 meters in the long jump and 14.49 meters in the triple jump. Although he is old now, he still hopes to be strong and create a miracle for the motherland.</p>
<p>The long jump of Ma Hua Li Fen once created an excellent record of 7.06 meters. The 6.69 meters of the Liaoning United Wang Shilin, the 6.64 meters of the Taiwanese Zhang Liren, the 6.53 meters of Hebei Cui Zhensheng, and the old general Zhang Jia of Ting Su, etc., can all compete for results. In terms of the triple jump, the 14 meters of the Air Force's Huang Jian and the 13.40 meters of the Fujian's Xu Fengshan are not weak.</p>
<p>Javelin Expected to Break Record</p>
<p>Secondly, it depends on the javelin of Wang Xuewu of the Navy. This man was frustrated in the 6th National Games; the recent results, I heard, reached 55.2 meters, breaking Zhou Changxing's national record of 53.85 meters. This time, I wish Mr. Wang to do well and make a splash in one fell swoop. In addition, the 49.92 meters of the Army's Chen Jichuan and the 48.9 meters of the Taiwan... are all scoring records.</p>
<p>Shot put, discus, high jump, and pole vault are unlikely to have amazing results. Look at the known excellent records of the events, the shot put has Qi Peilin's 12.95 meters, and his discus also has a result of 41.4 meters. The Air Force's Wang Rui's 39 meters is not high either. The high jump seems to be the strongest with the 1.83 meters of the Army's Liu Mengjiu. The results of the pole vault in various places are not worth mentioning. After Fu Wang (Bao Ying), is there really no second person to think about?</p>
<p>Women's</p>
<p>Fujian's Strength is the Most Powerful</p>
<p>Looking at this year's women's field events, it will be more exciting than the men's field events. To be optimistic, all records have the possibility of being refreshed. The overall championship should be most likely to be won by the Fujian team. The team has a total of ten members, most of whom are young students from Pu Tian Middle School. They are aggressive, solid, and have all male-type sports postures. Seeing the invincible results they achieved during their expedition to Beijing and Shanghai last year, you will know the basis of my prediction.</p>
<p>Then, let's discuss the possibility of breaking the records in each event: in order, let's first talk about the high jump. In the selection competition in Beiping, Wu Shusen jumped over 1.365 meters in one fell swoop. Zhu Tianzhen's national record of 1.355 meters was completely shattered. Ms. Wu can surely win the high jump championship this time. Chen...zhen of Shanghai is also close to the national record with 1.34 meters. It is a pity that Jinan's Mei Lin, who has a good record of 1.40 meters, could not participate for some reason.</p>
<p>In the long jump, Chen Biying of Fujian has a result of 5.03 meters, only 0.03 meters short of Yin...'s national record of 5.06 meters. Ms. Chen is full of energy, and if the situation is normal, she will surely break the record. In addition, Qing Chen Duannian's 4.68 meters, He Zhang Ganmei's 4.61 meters, and Wu Shuying of Fujian's 4.55 meters are all good works.</p>
<p>Beiping's Three Iron New Comet</p>
<p>The most gratifying thing in this year's women's field events is that Beiping has discovered a new comet in shot put and discus - Wang Canhua. Miss Wang is as strong as a man, and with a swing of her arm, she gets 10.87 meters in the shot put and 33.37 meters in the discus. Both of these broke the record held by Chen Rongtang for more than ten years. This time, she will undoubtedly take the double-iron championship.</p>
<p>Chen Rongtang, the women's three-iron champion of the last National Games, made a comeback this time and represented Indonesia. Although Chen is old and fat, the most important thing for a three-iron thrower is stable weight. Although Ms. Chen's recent results have not been officially tested, her strength is still not to be underestimated. In the women's three-iron, she can still compete for the second and third place.</p>
<p>In addition, Xian Shaomei of Beiping also has the strength of more than 10 meters in the shot put. Her discus results are also good. He Zhang Ruiyan's double results are not weak either. Can score points. In terms of the javelin, Wang...hua wants to maintain the shot put and discus strength relationship, and has not seen participation, then, will see Ping Xian Shaomei, Tai Li Shude, Chen Rong, etc.</p>
<p>But the Fujian team's team members have average results, with more chances to score, so the hope of first place in total score is of course the most.</p>
<p>The above are just some... Like what I said at the beginning of this article, any unexpected factor is the result of the original prediction. However, assuming that everything is normal, I believe that these conjectures, although not in the middle, are not...</p>

<h3 id="e102">Wang Zhengting and Zhang Boling Talk About Their Feelings on the National Games to Our Reporter Yesterday <a href="#e102" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c102" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">102</a></h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] Yesterday was the opening of the 7th National Games. Our reporter specially invited Dr. Wang Zhengting to express his feelings about the National Games. He said: (1) The National Games have not been held for twelve years. Today, it can be opened solemnly as scheduled, which can be reported to the people. (2) This year's National Games, due to insufficient funds and such a short preparation time, was able to have 52 units participating, and the people were so enthusiastic and excited, thanks to the efforts of the central government, the Shanghai municipal government, especially Mayor Wu. I am very grateful. (3) Today, people saw the return of compatriots from Taiwan, who had been liberated from their motherland, compatriots from the Northeast, who had been in the hands of the enemy for a long time, compatriots from border provinces such as Xinjiang and Xikang, and overseas Chinese, and felt very excited. (4) I hope that the country will be peaceful soon, and that the next National Games will have sufficient time and funding to be held better than this one.</p>
<p>The reporter then visited Mr. Zhang Boling, who expressed his feelings as follows: This National Games was able to open on time under such circumstances and lack of funds, which is not easy, and its significance is extremely important. This National Games was held after the national National Assembly, the election of the president, and the implementation of the new Constitution. The Chinese have always been weak, and sports can teach us to compete. Other competitions are for "power" and for "profit", while the sports meeting is for "name". On the other hand, the competition in the sports meeting is a competition with rules. Any competition must not violate the rules, and everyone must abide by the law. Today's conference is a concrete manifestation of building a democratic country and teaching people how to abide by the law. (Easy)</p>
<h3 id="e103">China's National Games Village: Some Hope to Make a Sports Fortune <a href="#e103" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c103" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">103</a></h3>
<p>[Special Report from Our Newspaper] Inside the venues of the National Games, fierce competitions are unfolding one after another. But have you ever taken a stroll outside the venues? The temporary shops and restaurants you see are like fortresses, each vying for attention and trying to outdo the others. Their energy is even more intense and exciting than what's happening in the arenas. If we were to call this area of mat sheds a "National Games Village," a makeshift version of the Olympic Village, it would be fitting. This "village," surrounding the back wall of the East Grandstand, forms a "Y" shape. Most of the restaurants are located on the two forks of the "Y," offering cold drinks and snacks. The cold drink stores are slightly more lavishly decorated. After all, a red Coca-Cola refrigerator or a yellow "Beauty" brand refrigerator gives them a head start in terms of style. It's unlike the temporary stoves made of several gasoline barrels stacked with lime, which ruin the aesthetic appeal right away. However, tastes vary. While customers are enjoying drinks at "Emerald Valley," "Old Songcheng" is equally popular, with loud orders for pork chops with double servings.</p>
<p>Businesses that have already opened are attracting customers. Cold drink stores are busy hiring trucks (costing 2.4 million yuan per trip) to replenish their stock constantly. While a storefront may only cost 30 to 40 million yuan, the goods inside are worth more than ten times that amount. Most owners estimate they will double their capital, hoping that Heaven will let them make a "sports fortune."</p>
<p>On the straight path is a warehouse of spiritual food, a "cultural street." Three-ply boards costing over 300,000 yuan each, fir wood costing nearly 20,000 yuan per foot, and enough paint to open a small paint shop, plus labor calculated at 2.5 yuan based on the cost-of-living index, decorate this street beautifully. Who would know that it is "painted on the outside, with mat sheds inside?" Each has its own beauty, each has its own charm. Like the two storefronts next door to our newspaper, we can honestly tell you the temperature, so you can decide whether to have ice or add clothing. We can also tell you the time, so you won't miss any exciting events.</p>
<p>There is also a fierce advertising war here. The billboards erected outside the sports venues, high and low like city walls, advertise cigarettes, newspapers, medicines, shoes and socks, banks, and even movie close-ups. Each 80-square-foot space costs 240 million yuan. It is said that after deducting costs, the advertising companies will give all the proceeds to the Games organizers. This is truly a considerable source of extra income. It is also said that a cigarette factory wanted to erect a cigarette can on the scoreboard, but the advertising company refused, saying it would affect the accounts distributed on both sides. More prominent advertisements are those of the Whirling Ball Club and Coca-Cola, one with bold strokes and the other with small horizontal advertisements around the basketball court, gymnasium, and swimming pool. Most of them share the idea of not seeking profit but hoping to build a brand. Excellent, excellent!</p>
<p>Turning to the vicinity of the main gate, a temporary dining hall is already piled with four geese, a pig, and boxes of yellow croaker. The staff are busy scaling the fish. A basket of old bamboo shoots is said to be for soup. On the north side, there is also a shop hidden behind the trees with an old card-style sign that reads, "Shanghai Municipal Committee for the Comfort and慰勞of Suppression-of-Rebellion Soldiers Tiger Stove." Now, it also sells water and coal, and offers meals. Friends who want to eat or drink can be introduced to these two affordable places.</p>
<p>The road outside the sports venue, which has been deserted for many years, now also seems "lively." The old proprietress of a noodle shop told me in a low voice: "I didn't have the money to set up a shop inside the venue, so I just renovated the original place. But even that cost over 50 million yuan." These people are truly seeking profit from small capital. They only hope that the spectators who can't get into the venue will patronize them.</p>
<p>The police bureau has unprecedentedly put up a signboard: "Lost, stolen, emergency? Report to the police service station immediately." Hopefully, this sign is just for show and won't be treated the same as those with business interests. (Education)</p>

<p>The National Games General Affairs Section announces: The schedule for school and group visits on the 7th (tomorrow) has been arranged, including the list of schools and the number of people. Each school can bring a notification letter and purchase tickets at the Postal Savings Bureau at 36 Jiujiang Road one day before the scheduled date. The ticket price is 20,000 yuan per ticket. To provide dedicated service, the Postal Savings Bureau has also set up temporary business units inside the venue and at the Central Training Corps on Shuidian Road to handle savings, remittance, and mail collection services.</p>
<p>The National Games Medals Collection Team worked diligently yesterday, writing and painting. The trophies are inlaid with jade, exquisitely crafted, and full of splendor. Those who came to deliver the medals continued to stream in. Chu Chia-hua, President of the National Games, accompanied by Director Li of the Education Bureau, drove to the athletes' dormitory at the Central Training Corps at 5:30 PM yesterday and left after 7:00 PM.</p>
<p>The National Games General Affairs Section clarifies: A rumor has been spreading that the daily allowance for the staff of the various groups of the Games ranges from a minimum of 1 million yuan to a maximum of 4 million yuan, which is a misrepresentation. Due to financial difficulties, most of the staff are providing voluntary service. The heads of the groups only receive a transportation allowance of 6 million yuan once. The chief executives receive a monthly allowance of 4.5 million yuan for a limited period of two months. Assistant executives and temporary staff only receive an allowance of 2 million yuan for ten days.</p>
<h3 id="e105">Head of Stall Vendors Loses His Gun and Finds It Again; The Fattest Man Gets Laughter from the Crowd <a href="#e105" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c105" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">105</a></h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Traffic control is the most troublesome. Mayor Wu took the lead in demonstrating how to drive the car out of the venue, followed by broadcasts from police officers in jeeps and motorized bicycles, loudly urging them to drive out the black marketeers like driving away locusts from the venue.</p>
<p>Hawkers are everywhere, with hawkers selling sugared plums and vegetarian goose.</p>
<p>Insufficient power causes the lights to give off a yellow glow. Due to the remote location of the Southern restaurants behind the East Grandstand, business is slow, and all the ice bricks stored there have melted. To make matters worse, they petitioned the stall vendors section.</p>
<p>Today, the entrance will be through the West Gate to ensure even distribution of spectators and to protect the business of remote vendors.</p>
<p>Yesterday's temperature, according to the thermometer on our newspaper, was 66 degrees in the morning at 8:00 AM, 82.5 degrees at noon, and 80 degrees at 5:00 PM.</p>
<p>Our newspaper's photos attract countless viewers. Some see themselves in the picture and wave their hands. At one moment, the pigeon team arrives; at another moment, the flash news is posted; at another moment, the special press car arrives from Nanjing.</p>
<p>A price list inside the venue: Straw hats cost 180,000 yuan each, and tofu soup without shredded pork costs 50,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Li Shi-tseng's wife, with her plump figure, wore a green floral cheongsam in the morning and changed into a gray-based pink floral cheongsam in the afternoon, attracting attention. Wu Shao-shu wore dark glasses and the badge of the Standing Committee, strolling through the cultural street with his wife and daughter.</p>
<p>The fattest man in the entire venue is the motorcycle driver No. 2325 of the Yijing Militia Brigade in Songshan District. Guiding the torch into the venue, he was seen as a miracle, causing a roar of laughter.</p>
<p>The order was greatly disrupted in the afternoon, and resourceful cars entered the venue one after another, and a large number of vendors appeared to grab business.</p>
<p>Jin Ying-lin, the head of the stall vendors section, went to the Air Force Hostel to negotiate the reception of foreign guests, but was beaten up, with swollen cheeks and a missing badge. His personal gun was lost and recovered. Staff from the traffic control section angrily resigned, demanding Mayor Wu and Commander Xuan for guarantees.</p>
<p>The rent paid by stall vendors, as of yesterday, reached 5.3 billion yuan, more than double the original estimate. (Education)</p>

<h3 id="e106">Squeeze! Push! Rush! Problems finally emerge! Railings collapse! 32 Men and women injured. Five ambulance teams dispatched. <a href="#e106" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c106" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">106</a></h3>
<p>[Special Report from Our Newspaper] Yesterday's National Games can only be described with one word: "crowded." And it was not just crowded; it was beyond the point of being crowded. Squeezing, pushing, and rushing went together, causing people to fall, bleed, break their arms, and faint. Some people cried out for their parents, and losing shoes was the least of their worries.</p>
<p>Before the Games opened at 3:00 PM, 14 people had already been carried to the Boy Scout ambulance team for emergency treatment. According to records, a total of 32 spectators were injured, with seven suffering more serious injuries and three sent to the hospital for treatment.</p>
<p>At 2:30 PM yesterday afternoon, a section of railing on the right side of the East Grandstand suddenly broke, and over 200 spectators fell and jumped down. The first to fall was a fifth-grade student from Pei Ying Primary School named Hua Qingzhong (also known as Jianzhong). This 14-year-old boy couldn't withstand the squeeze, push, and rush of the crowd behind him, and the railing in front of him was not sturdy, so he fell with the broken railing, injuring his leg. After some first aid, he was sent to the Weidemei Road Police Hospital. Another person, Jia Yunsheng, broke his right forearm. The paramedics bandaged and suspended his right arm before sending him to the Municipal Hospital. Wang Yin suffered a contusion on his left leg and was sent to the Police Hospital. In addition, more than ten people suffered injuries to their waists, legs, and arms, including Dai Chuanliang, Peng Ji, Jiang Weiqing, Wang Dongfang, Wang Linsen, Tian Jianong, Wang Huanqin, and Gao Maoqing. Four or five of them were young children, but fortunately, their injuries were not serious.</p>
<p>Soon after, a section of railing on the left side of the West Grandstand also broke, and a section of railing on the North Grandstand also broke. Although 50 to 60 people rushed down in each incident, only one little girl, Wu Yingmei, suffered a concussion and was slightly unconscious, but she recovered after first aid.</p>
<p>After the three incidents, the people in the stands became vigilant, and no more accidents occurred. However, at 3:25 PM, while Mayor Wu was giving a speech on the West Grandstand, a large crowd suddenly rushed in from the gate below, causing chaos. The soldiers and police maintaining order could not stop them. In this chaotic situation, many people were pushed down, especially women and children. Several women tore their silk stockings, and blood streamed down their thighs.</p>
<p>As a result, most of the people who rushed in were escorted out by the soldiers and police, but a few managed to escape being expelled. When reporters asked them why they rushed in, they replied that they had bought tickets but had no way to get into the grandstand, so they had to rush towards the gate, and said that there were more than 2,000 people outside with tickets who couldn't get in.</p>
<p>These spectators who wanted to rush in and the soldiers and police who maintained order were in a stalemate for about half an hour. At 4:00 PM, they were all let in because they had spent 50,000 or 200,000 legal currency to buy tickets but could not get into the grandstand, which was already packed and could no longer accommodate them.</p>
<p>According to the Boy Scouts responsible for security and rescue, the railings were not sturdy and broke easily when squeezed. Moreover, there were many broken pieces of shrapnel on the walkways, making it easier to get injured. They collected more than 30 pieces of discarded shrapnel. As for those who had tickets but couldn't get in, it shouldn't be the responsibility of the ticket buyers.</p>
<p>Without the two accidents mentioned above, the order of yesterday's Games could have been much better, because the authorities dispatched a large number of soldiers and police to maintain order, and the arrangements were quite thorough, with people in every corner. The police bureau sent 150 mobile police officers, three companies of security police, 44 juvenile police officers, and the entire Criminal Investigation Section, plus female police officers, and the traffic brigade to maintain order outside the venue. The military police sent a guard company, and the garrison brigade also dispatched many personnel, plus 100 Boy Scouts.</p>
<p>Regarding the ambulance in the venue, there were five ambulance teams in the venue yesterday, staffed by 74 Boy Scouts and medical personnel. They did their best, but because there were too many "accidents," they seemed weak. At this rate, two or three more ambulance teams may be needed.</p>
<p>In addition, the volunteer fire brigade participated with nine units, dispatching seven vehicles and 60 firefighters to participate in the rescue work. (Gang)</p>
<h3 id="e107">Preventing a Repeat of Tragedy: Rushing to Build Wire Mesh Frames <a href="#e107" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c107" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">107</a></h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The National Games authorities, in view of the importance of maintaining order at the Games and the disorder among some spectators during yesterday's opening ceremony, during which a small part of the grandstand's cement railings were pushed down due to overcrowding, held a joint meeting last night with the leaders of the various groups responsible for security, traffic, venue, and ticketing to discuss improvement measures. After careful discussion, it was decided to strengthen security, delineate a restricted area, increase the entrances and exits of the grandstand, and rush to build 20 wire mesh frames to be placed at various important entrances and exits. If time permits, they will be used today to prevent the recurrence of spectators breaking down entrances. Closer coordination between the various groups is required.</p>

<h3 id="e108">Rice Market Speculation Worsens; Authorities Decide on Stabilization Methods; Rice Prices Must Not Exceed Yesterday's Closing Price Starting Today <a href="#e108" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c108" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">108</a></h3>
<p>In light of the recent soaring grain prices in the city, Mayor Wu paid close attention to the situation. He inquired by telephone with the Chairman of the People's Livelihood Investigation Committee, Ren Xianqun, at 10:00 AM yesterday and contacted Director Wu of the Social Affairs Bureau to exchange opinions. They decided on measures to stipulate that, starting from the 6th, all rice, flour, and oil prices must not exceed the closing prices of the 5th. If prices exceed this limit, the People's Livelihood Investigation Committee will supply rice, oil, and flour to the market without restrictions, it was announced.</p>
<p>The rice market speculation intensified yesterday. The price of Wuxi-produced rice rose sharply, and those holding goods became more reluctant to sell. The early and mid-day markets saw the tightest supply. The price of Bai Jing rice in the Southern market rose by 400,000 yuan, the price of Bo Dao rice jumped by 450,000 yuan, and the price of other Xian rice varieties also rose by 400,000 yuan. Near closing time, there was some high-altitude selling, and prices slightly retreated. The price of Bai Jing early rice and Xian rice each rose by 300,000 yuan in the Northern market. The price of Special High Jing reached 4.85 million yuan, Bai Jing traded at 4.75 million yuan, and Bai Yuan reached the 5 million yuan mark. By closing time, prices had also slightly recovered. Yesterday's arrivals totaled 5,894 stones.</p>
<p>As soon as the flour market opened, it rose to the limit. There were very few transactions in the market, and the prices quoted outside the market were chaotic. Lao Che and Bing Chuan were quoted as high as 1.65 million yuan each, and Hong Feng and Jian Cheng each traded at 1.6 million yuan. Later in the market, prices slightly recovered, with Lao Che and Bing Chuan each falling to 1.6 million yuan and Jian Cheng and Hong Feng also falling slightly, but still rising by about 60,000 yuan compared to the previous day. Bran was initially reluctant to open, but later, large bags traded at 1.05 million yuan. Wheat mill inventory increased by 200,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Miscellaneous Grains: Hankou rice initially rose to 2.4 million yuan, an increase of 150,000 yuan, but prices were slightly stable later in the market. Corn also rose by more than 100,000 yuan. Picked Qing corn was in short supply and was quoted as high as 200,000 yuan, but no transactions were made. Red beans rose by 150,000 yuan. Lu beans were taken by both local and out-of-town merchants, rising by a staggering 300,000 yuan. Sand red beans were quoted at 5 million yuan, a rise of 300,000 yuan. Under the competition of out-of-town merchants, raw sesame kernels each rose by about 300,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Edible Oil: The sharp rise became more intense. Soybean oil initially opened at the 10 million yuan mark and then rose further to 10.2 million yuan under buying pressure, finally reaching 10.3 million yuan, a sharp increase of 700,000 yuan. The raw oil market was even more chaotic. Jiangbei Ji barrel raw oil opened at 11.8 million yuan and then rose to 12 million yuan. Qingdao Ji barrel raw oil rose to 12.5 million yuan, a sharp increase of 800,000 yuan. Small vehicle sesame oil rose by 1.5 million yuan, and soybean cake continued to rise by 50,000 yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e109">Commercial Conditions in Various Places <a href="#e109" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c109" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">109</a></h3>
<p>Wuxi: [Report from our Wuxi correspondent on the 5th] The price increase is sharp and has no end in sight. The authorities have sent personnel to suppress the rise, but it is still ineffective. Bai Jing is selling for 4.8 million yuan at the door, and the market is opening at 4.726 million yuan. Bai Yuan is at 5.176 million yuan, Yang Xian is at 4.646 million yuan, Bu Xian is at 4.556 million yuan, Xinghua Xian is at 4.596 million yuan, Jing Dao is at 2.184 million yuan, wheat is at 4.14 million yuan, white wheat is at 4.3 million yuan, Bing Chuan flour is at 1.588 million yuan, and Shuang Yu yarn is at 164.4 million yuan.</p>
<p>Suzhou: [Report from our Suzhou correspondent on the 5th] Because rice prices in neighboring counties have risen sharply, the market is experiencing strong buying interest. With both buyers and sellers pushing prices up, the price of coarse Jing rice opened at 4.09 million yuan, and the price of Bai Jing rice opened at 4.68 million yuan. The price of Shang Bai rice sold at the door is 4.8 million yuan. The intensity of the price increase is unprecedented.</p>
<p>Guangzhou: [Report from our Guangzhou correspondent on the 5th] Prices here have risen sharply again. Rice prices are rising by more than 400,000 yuan per market dan (unit of weight) per day, breaking the 6 million yuan mark. The Hong Kong dollar is worth 150 yuan, and everything is rising with no drop.</p>
<p>Beiping: [Report from our Beiping correspondent on the 4th] Beiping was stimulated by Tianjin and Shanghai, and the gold banknote soared. Gold once broke the 500 mark, and the US dollar once broke the 1 million mark. The flow of capital from the Northeast into the Guan area is becoming more intense. The amount of remittances received in Beiping in April reached 1.4 trillion yuan.</p>
<p>Qingdao: [Report from our Qingdao correspondent on the 5th] The black market for gold banknotes in Qingdao is rising in a straight line. Decorative gold, including labor, is 66 million yuan, gold bars are 57 million yuan, and the US dollar has broken the 1 million yuan mark. Yarn, cloth, and food are still stable.</p>
<p>Jinan: [Report from our Jinan correspondent on the 5th] In recent days, the price of gold in Jinan has been rising due to the district bureau's crackdown on the black market. A week ago, the secret market price was only 41 million yuan per tael, but on the 5th, it broke the 50 million yuan mark, reaching over 51 million yuan. The prices of food, flour, and other goods have all been driven up.</p>
<p>Baoding: [Report from our Baoding correspondent on the 5th] Prices in Baoding have risen sharply again. Tong Fen flour is now priced at 3 million yuan per bag.</p>
<p>Xi'an: [Report from our Xi'an correspondent on the 5th] The price of gold has risen again. The price today is 53.5 million yuan per tael, breaking the highest record.</p>
<h3 id="e110">The Focus of the Chinese Stock Market is on Buying. Yong Yarn Creates a New Price. <a href="#e110" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c110" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">110</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Chinese stock market focused on buying Yong yarn. Buyers from the Guangdong business community and the financial community were present, reaching a new peak of 2610 yuan. However, the yarn and cloth market declined due to the poor performance of miscellaneous stocks. Tong Yi showed a certain amount of elasticity.</p>
<p>The morning opening was weak. It is possible that short-term treasury bonds will be listed. Yong yarn opened at a low of 2450 yuan. After the opening, it advanced to 2490 yuan. Some people unloaded, and the listed price did not change, retreating to 2460 yuan and then rising to 2540 yuan. The commission fee opened at 21 yuan and 24 yuan, retreating to 2505 yuan. The foreign stocks bought by the Xi business community were still popular, and they rose again to a new peak of 2546 yuan. Nos. 89 and others unloaded together, breaking the 2500 yuan mark. The yarn and cloth market began to decline slightly, and short positions closed out. Around noon, prices fell twice to a low of 2475 yuan. The afternoon closing was 2505 yuan, slightly higher than the previous closing for Tong Yi and Yong yarn. Da Tong was flat, and Mei Xin, Heng Feng, Zhong Fa, Mei Ya, Jing Lun, and Xin Hua fell by half a percent. The rest all fell slightly.</p>
<p>In the afternoon market, Yong yarn was first absorbed by the Guangdong business community. In addition, Nos. 76 and 186 also bought, rising to 2580 yuan. There were rumors that a certain buyer was being audited, and Nos. 157, 171, 160, 154, and 156 sold, once retreating below 2520 yuan. The National Bank's difference was not much. No. 171 made up for its strength after releasing stocks, and Nos. 169, 69, 52, and the Guangdong business community came in, and foreign stocks were again popular. Yong yarn then created a new peak of 2610 yuan. Only Tong Yi had the strength to revive, and there were few changes in the remaining stocks. No. 157 and others closed out, and the closing price was 2580 yuan. Compared with the morning closing, Yong Ye rose to the limit, and Mei Ya, Tong Yi, Rong Feng, Zhong Ni, Jing Lun, and Xin Yi each rose by half a percent. Heng Feng was flat, and the rest rose slightly. Unlisted stocks outside the market generally rose by half a percent to one percent.</p>

<p>The price of rayon in the market rose slightly yesterday. The most active "Asahi" yarn of No. 120 opened at around 334 million yuan in the morning. The largest spot was 37 million yuan, and the next day was 40 million yuan. The next day's closing was 37 million yuan in the afternoon.

<h3 id="e114">Yarn Prices Fall, Cloth Prices Rise <a href="#e114" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c114" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">114</a></h3>
<p>In the cotton yarn market yesterday, the morning opening continued because of the strong buying interest from all sides. The high price of 42 count Blue Phoenix fine yarn was called 278 million yuan. Since the buying interest was turning sluggish, most of the yarn industry in this street was waiting and seeing. Before long, short sellers seized the opportunity to move, and Fangjian suddenly hung up a sign to accept applications, and the market suddenly collapsed, closing at 270 million yuan, a drop of 4 million yuan compared to the previous day. The price of 21 count Shuangma yarn was firm at first and then tired, eventually falling by 1 million yuan. The prices of all other coarse and fine yarns also fell.</p>
<p>In the cotton cloth market yesterday, although actual sales were rare, the trading in the market was very lively. Twelve-pound Longtou fine cloth rose all the way from 5.44 million yuan to 6.66 million yuan. Afterwards, because people in the industry thought that the price was too high, they competed to sell each other. The profit-taking of floating households, which reduced prices, ended at 5.63 million yuan, a rise of 180,000 yuan compared to the previous day. The prices of Wufu Caiqiu, Lanji, and other fine cloths all rose by 150,000 to 223,000 yuan. Biji Zhigong's transactions were lively, and the price continued to rise by about 300,000 yuan. The rising momentum of other bleached cloth, colored cloth, and Shilin cloth was also very strong. The final transaction for Longtou fine cloth, for delivery tomorrow, was 5.54 million yuan, and there were few buyers.</p>
<p>Spot Cotton Soars: In the spot cotton market yesterday, quotations rose madly. Supply was scarce, and the chips in the market were suddenly exhausted. As a result, transactions were interrupted, and only one batch of Guide Shuang Huanghua was traded, priced at 20.9 million. Zhoupu Zi Hua 5.19 million to 5.5 million.</p>
<p>Yarn and Cloth Transported to the South: [Report from Our Newspaper] After the ban on transporting cotton yarn and cotton cloth to the south was lifted, a large amount of yarn and cloth has been transported to Guangdong in recent days. The Hai Zhou Wheel transported 5,000 pieces of cotton yarn and 7,000 pieces of cotton cloth to Guangdong the day before yesterday. The Han Min Wheel is scheduled to sail to Guangzhou on Saturday, and the amount of cotton yarn reported to be loaded is already over 3,000 pieces, and cotton cloth is over 7,000 pieces. During the period when the transport to the south was prohibited, the yarn and cloth transported to Guangdong were transported to Wuhan by Jiang Wheel and then transferred to the Yuehan Wheel. Now it has been changed to direct sea transport to Guangzhou, so the amount of yarn and cloth transported to Wuhan by Jiang Wheel has greatly decreased.</p>
<h3 id="e115">Changing the Allocation Method of Goods Obtained Through Barter with Japan by China Trust Bureau <a href="#e115" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c115" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">115</a></h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] It has come to our attention that in the past, the China Trust Bureau (中信局) often allocated goods obtained through barter trade with Japan to various government agencies based on official exchange rates, resulting in substantial losses. This created a significant overdraft in the barter accounts, leading to difficulties in expanding the business. This year, the Bureau is changing its approach, requiring agencies receiving goods to exchange them for materials of equal value. The first such transaction has already been completed, with the Kaiyuan Coal Mine (開澯煤礦) exchanging 10,000 tons of coal dust with the China Trust Bureau for Japanese dynamite and parts of equivalent value. The mine has also requested the China Trust Bureau to continue supplying 3 million pit props (窰木), offering coal as payment. The negotiated price for the coal is $18 USD per ton (F.O.B. Qingdao). The price of the Japanese pit props is still under discussion, with the Japanese side initially asking $4.05 USD per large bundle, while the Chinese side hopes to settle at $3.55 USD. In addition, the Huainan Coal Mine (淮南煤礦) has requested 800,000 pit props in exchange for their coal, and the East China Coal Mine (華東煤礦) has requested 500,000 pit props, also offering their coal as payment.</p>
<h3 id="e116">Replicated Chunmee Tea for Export to Be Available Soon <a href="#e116" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c116" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">116</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the foreign tea market was calm. Although exporters and goods owners negotiated, both sides were persistent, so the market was quiet. According to people in the industry, this year's Wenzhou (溫州) new stir-fried green tea, since its appearance a few days ago, is currently being replicated by companies into export styles like Chunmee (珍眉). They are expected to be manufactured and available for market distribution within days. However, given the high cost of procurement, the asking prices are bound to be very high. As for tea for domestic sales, sales in Tianjin (津帮) remain stagnant, while sales in other regions are still continuous, so the situation is not bleak. Regarding prices, old tea with empty inventories continues to hover at a high level. As for this year's new Longjing (龍井), Huangtang (黃湯), and Biluochun (碧螺春), the market atmosphere has been hard to maintain because they are not as fresh and tender as the previous batches.</p>
<h3 id="e117">Sugar Prices Rise Endlessly <a href="#e117" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c117" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">117</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market, after an initial period of calmness, tightened as sales to the north were very active, making any easing of prices difficult to foresee in the short term. Furthermore, certain rumors further stimulated the rise, so the market felt even more intense at the end. The highest difference in the Guild's (公會) price range reached 500,000 yuan, while the smaller fluctuations were still around 100,000 yuan. As a result, the price of No. 19 raw sugar spot (現貨) increased by over 6%, the price of No. 200 raw sugar spot decreased by slightly less than 3%, the price of four-and-a-half bag sugar increased by 4%, and the rise in bag sugar was similar. No. 200 refined medium sugar (中砂白) increased by 5%, Peruvian raw sugar (比魯砠) increased by 21% compared to one week ago, and the exchange rate of the Taiwan dollar (台幣) increased by 12 yuan, reaching 268 yuan.</p>
<p>The rise in native sugar (土糖) prices was more moderate. Shantou (汕提) green sugar rose from 4.7 million yuan to 4.8 million yuan, an increase of 50,000 yuan. Cotton red (棉赤) was at 4.9 million yuan, with about 200 bags traded. Xinghua (興化) white sugar was at 7.23 million yuan, and Xinghua red high-quality sugar was at 5.1 million yuan, with several hundred pieces traded. Diao green (刁靑) was at 4.15 million yuan, with 300-400 bags traded, with prices later increasing. Miscellaneous red (什路赤) was at 4.45 million yuan, and its momentum suggests further upward potential if there are no unexpected obstacles.</p>

<h3 id="e118">Citizen and Government <a href="#e118" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c118" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">118</a></h3>
<p>— Chu Yukun (儲玉坤)</p>
<p>(The Citizen and Government, by John A. Hawgood Nicholson &amp; Watson, London, 1947. 128 pages, actual price 6 shillings.)</p>
<p>This book is one of the "New Democracy Series" edited by Mr. Edwards. In his introduction, he states, "A hundred years ago, humanity sacrificed millions of lives for the sake of democracy. Although the struggle resulted in complete victory, allowing democracy to spread throughout the world, the ideals were shattered, and the passion disappeared. This phenomenon must not be allowed to repeat itself. We have once again emerged victorious in the Second World War. At this moment, democracy must win the peace.</p>
<p>"We believe that the main reason the peace negotiators of 1919 lost the peace for democracy was that they did not clearly understand the basic principles of democracy and its outward forms. Now that we have paid a heavy price for their mistakes, we must find a way to adapt 19th-century democracy to the circumstances of the 20th century. We must acknowledge that the progress of science, coupled with the stimulus of 'total war,' has created many new possibilities and new social organizations, revolutionizing human society. Only democracy can become a dynamic force, utilizing all new discoveries and technologies to ensure that humanity no longer has unemployment and that society no longer experiences unease or need, paving a new frontier for human life and freedom. Only then can democracy survive in this world. This task cannot be entirely delegated to politicians and experts but should be undertaken by every citizen. The essence of a democratic country lies in the fact that every citizen can participate in the decision-making of tasks." From this, we can also see the purpose of Mr. Edwards' editing of the New Democracy Series.</p>
<p>The author of this book, Mr. Hawgood, is a professor of political history at the University of Birmingham, who has specialized in public administration in various European and American countries. He has conducted in-depth research on administrative methods and is considered an authority in the United Kingdom. According to his article to the readers, this book was originally co-authored by the author and Mr. Owen. However, due to Mr. Owen's employment in the United Nations and his busy schedule, the author completed it alone. Chapter 4, "Industrial Democracy," was co-authored with Mr. Edwards, the editor of the "New Democracy Series."</p>
<p>At a time when political democratization is just beginning in our country, I believe that this booklet is worth introducing to readers. Because at present, the common people still do not feel very interested in politics. Although the National Assembly representatives and legislators are all elected by the people, voter turnout is not enthusiastic. Some elected National Assembly representatives or legislators do not know what representation means. Some even think that becoming a National Assembly representative means becoming a high-ranking official who can act recklessly. We have seen a National Assembly representative punch and injure a National Assembly staff member, and we are truly worried about the democratic politics of our country! In addition, there is another phenomenon in the country. We often see cries for "democracy, democracy" in newspapers and magazines, but we rarely see discussions on democratic theory. I want to advise domestic political scholars that it is better to write more books on democracy than to loudly chant democracy, especially to publish more popular booklets, which can become popular in the country and awaken the political awareness of the general public.</p>
<p>The content of this book is simple and clear, divided into seven chapters, and a brief introduction is as follows: (1) Several questions about citizens explain that citizens in modern democratic countries should adopt various methods to influence national legislation, policy decisions, and national administration. Therefore, the author says in a positive tone that citizens are not enough to exert the spirit of democratic politics by voting alone. However, the author collected many illustrations to illustrate the people's struggle for the right to vote. (2) Parliamentary democracy explains the British member selection method. Although it was modified in 1944, it is largely the same as before the war. The author records that members of the British House of Commons have three different identities: 1. Local representatives; 2. National representatives; 3. Representatives of a certain sector. (3) Local democratic government first explains the reforms of the 19th century and the needs of the 20th century. Taking the local governments of the United Kingdom, France, and Germany as examples, it is believed that reforms are needed in terms of organization. Secondly, the status of elected senators is explained. Finally, the special problems of rural societies are listed.</p>
<p>The fourth chapter on industrial democracy begins by saying that the British Trades Union Congress today has eight million members, making it the largest force in the United Kingdom. The internal organization is completely democratic, like politics. It also decides work rules and elects executive committee members through meetings and voting. At the same time, there is also a judicial-like system for resolving internal disputes, and every worker is responsible for the Trades Union Congress. Chapter 6, Testing Public Opinion, can be studied in terms of technology. In 1940, the United Kingdom established the Wartime Social Survey Committee to investigate the public opinion of the war at any time. The United States and France also have public opinion research organizations. The British Institute of Public Opinion is a private organization, but it has made a great contribution to promoting democracy.</p>
<p>The last chapter is the education of citizens. The author believes that education should be universal throughout the country. In addition to formal elementary schools, middle schools, and universities that should be spread all over the country, other forms of civic education should be actively carried out. For example, the establishment of newspaper reading rooms and the holding of youth parliamentary meetings should not be ignored. Finally, the author also raises a big question, namely, "Citizens and the World." He believes that citizens of a democratic country also have a very close relationship with the consequences of their foreign policy. For example, the issue of peace and war is a matter of life and death, honor and disgrace, and joy and sorrow for him. Therefore, civic education should include a lot of information about foreign countries and their relationship with the United Kingdom. Although the British Broadcasting Corporation has done its best, democratic countries need more international knowledge. This suggestion is most worthy of our attention.</p>

<h3 id="e120">China's Economy in the Past Fifty Years <a href="#e120" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c120" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">120</a></h3>
<p>— Tian Chunyin (田春蔭)</p>
<p>China Commercial Bank's Fiftieth Anniversary Commemorative Album, edited by China Commercial Bank</p>
<p>Printed on April 25, 1947, 270 pages, not for sale</p>
<p>In recent years, the importance of the economy has become increasingly prominent. Among those who have made contributions to the rise of new industries in our country over the past few decades, the banking industry is undoubtedly the leader, regardless of its merits and demerits to society. The achievements of its advocacy of economic research, whether monographs or periodicals, have been demonstrated by the banking industry in the past ten years or so, making it the most convenient and abundant source of information for those studying modern history.</p>
<p>This album can also be regarded as one of these achievements. - This kind of commemoration in the form of written research is especially worthy of praise in China. - The bank published this album to commemorate its 50th anniversary. It inevitably has some commendations to the bank, such as the first article by Mr. Du Yuesheng (社月笙), "China Commercial Bank in the Past Fifty Years", and the appendix "Chronicle of Major Financial and Economic Events in China in the Past Fifty Years", which also uses the bank as a starting point and ending point, belonging to the achievements of a bank. However, it still has reference value for people who generally and specifically discuss the economy, because although the content is written by many people, the weight and viewpoints may not be consistent, but the writers are all experts and based on many data, which is not without merit. Mr. Zhang Shizhao (章士釗)'s "Commemorative Remarks" made some remarks about Sheng Xuanhuai (盛宜懷), the founder of the bank, in which he said: "On the day of the revolution, Duke Sheng shouldered the heavy burden of the world by advocating the nationalization of railways. In fact, the articles at that time were very comprehensive in terms of caring for merchants' capital. Once this plan was abandoned, the Sichuan-Guangdong-Hankou Railway has not been completed to this day. The loans borrowed by the Luhan Railway had already been repaid as agreed, and it was not as Chen of the students who stayed abroad said. If the entire railway had been collected from the United States, the three provinces would have been connected more than thirty years ago, and what would the people's livelihood have relied on? Now that we discuss success or failure after the fact, almost all can see Duke Sheng's loyalty to planning for the country and his courage to bear resentment. Even the most radical scholars will not be able to change these words." It is a very objective argument. Although Duke Sheng is not enough to be called a great statesman, today's great statesmen can be said to be worthy of praising the spirit of "bearing resentment" for the sake of the country. In the Qing Dynasty, this kind of spirit was especially evident in Zeng Guofan (曾國藩) and Li Hongzhang (李鴻章), but now it gives people a feeling of almost stopping. The so-called "new politicians" take catering to the world as the standard of action. It is naturally due to the temporary gain and loss, but also because the foundation of learning and knowledge is not deep. The world follows the trend, whether it is words or deeds, and there is nowhere to see the traces of "impulsiveness", which is really a sad place. According to the "Sheng Yuzhai Manuscripts and Travel Diary to the East" published by Beijing Xiugengtang in 1942, Duke Sheng has experienced shipping, mining and other affairs for more than 40 years. All the manuscripts he has stored are important historical materials for examining the political, economic, transportation and diplomatic aspects of the late Qing Dynasty, and can be used to discuss Duke Sheng in detail.</p>
<p>In addition to the above-mentioned articles by Du and Zhang, this album includes Song Hanzhang's (宋漢章) "Evolution of Chinese Finance in the Past Fifty Years", Chen Guangfu's (陳光甫) "Chinese Finance in the Past Fifty Years", Yang Yinpu's (楊蔭溥) "Chinese Banking Industry in the Past Fifty Years", Qin Runqing's (秦潤卿) "Shanghai's Money Shop Industry in the Past Fifty Years", Huang Bingwei's (黃秉維) "Chinese Industry and Mining Industry in the Past Fifty Years", Shou Jingwei's (壽景偉) "Chinese International Trade in the Past Fifty Years", Wang Xiaowen's (王效文) "Chinese Insurance Industry in the Past Fifty Years", Zhang Baiyi's (張白衣) "Chinese Trust Business in the Past Twenty-six Years", and Luo Qinghua's (駱淸華) "Chinese Economy in the Past Fifty Years". There are many repetitions in the discussion, which is an unavoidable phenomenon of writing by many people. Among them, the articles of Yang, Qin, Huang, and Shou have reference value. Although they are not for sale, they are not difficult to see because they are given as gifts to public and private institutions. Therefore, this article is specially introduced to tell people in China who are studying the history of finance and economy in recent decades.</p>
<p>"Record of a Besieged City (危城記)" was successively published in Shen Bao and became one of my daily must-read courses; after this book was typeset and published, I read it again. I have a kind of partiality for this book, because the background selected in this book happens to be the occasion I personally experienced, so I feel especially kind and tasteful.</p>
<p>The author of this book, Qin Shouou (秦瘦鷗), is also a familiar writer. He has written many books in the past, especially the publication of "Begonia (秋海棠)", which gained a wide readership six years ago and was put on the stage, creating a performance record. However, "Record of a Besieged City" has made great progress compared to before in terms of writing skills, application of techniques, and processing of materials. It is natural to be happy to have such a book published in today's era of general decline in purchasing power, but how many readers have the spare energy to purchase and collect it? This is a question.</p>
<h3 id="e121">After Reading "Record of a Besieged City" <a href="#e121" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c121" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">121</a></h3>
<p>— Hu Hanjun (胡漢君)</p>
<p>Written by Qin Shouou, published by Huaizheng Culture Press (懷正文化社)</p>
<p>In fact, "Record of a Besieged City" is not just a novel, it is actually a chapter in a history that faithfully records the great tragedy of the late Anti-Japanese War. From this book, readers can not only get a glimpse of the outline of this stage, but also see through the inside story of the general institutions at that time being out of touch with the Anti-Japanese War. In these 250 pages of paper, the author can try his best to grasp and expose the essence of those lewd and inferior bodies wrapped in beautiful coats. In these 250 pages of paper, the author can absorb and digest many real faces of various types in this paragraph, and clearly depict them into an entire book surface, exhibited in front of us, and these faces are all characters we usually come into contact with and are familiar with, whether it is Associate Manager Zhu or Section Chief Xiong, movie queen Mrs. Pan or Xiao Shen, Xu Shaoming or the General Manager's wife. Not only a few years ago, even now, we can see it at any time and any corner. The author's arrangement of these actors is not exaggerated and Xuanran, so we feel kind and real because of its appropriateness. This should be said to be the author's greatest success.</p>
<p>In this book, the author also issued a warning to those who are in the Anti-Japanese War camp but forget their responsibilities (we may all be included): "The enemy is about to attack! Who will resist? How to resist? What should we do if they chase us again?"? When we recall the chaos in the rear during the Xiang-Gui Battle and the various situations where they never thought about how to strengthen the battle, but only made plans to escape, it is no wonder that the author finally intolerably dissected the lungs of these defeatists without mercy: "It seems that the Anti-Japanese War is completely someone else's business, they only care about one thing - escape!" We should really blush with each other.</p>
<p>The author has personally seen and participated in the performance of this great tragedy, so he sees the rear of the Anti-Japanese War quite clearly. In fact, how many people really did their best for the Anti-Japanese War in the eight years of the Anti-Japanese War? Whether in the front or rear, I really don't know how many people just used this sacred banner as a cover for their own promotion or wealth. This sudden disaster just served as a demon mirror, revealing the true faces of various people. The author can very well execute this task.</p>
<p>But the author is also a very emotional person after all, so after recording these phenomena, he finally sighed sadly: "That is really a dangerous city? It should be said that the "City of Fools" is more worthy of its name." How many are not fools at present?</p>
<p>In this book, the author also used Zhu Zhaonian's mouth to criticize the government system and bureaucratic style at that time. He roared: "Official affairs! Official affairs! So many people in the whole China are handling official affairs every day, and only then have they reached this day! If such official affairs continue to be handled, China will perish!" What a painful cry? In fact, is it only the Anti-Japanese War period that was like this? Now it is victory, and it has been transformed into a period of suppression of rebellion. Those bloody lessons in the past have not promoted and changed this kind of government system and bureaucratic style. Although "Record of a Besieged City" was completed two years ago, it is still a fresh book to read today. And I firmly believe that if things go on like this, even after ten years, there will be no promotion and change, then this book will become a fresh book for a long time. Isn't it sad?</p>

<h3 id="e122">The Symbol of the Torch <a href="#e122" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c122" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">122</a></h3>
<p>— Jingwen (靖文)</p>
<p>When this article is published, the torch relay starting from the gate of the Presidential Palace in the capital must have reached its Shanghai destination, and the 7th National Games must be in full swing.</p>
<p>The torch of course symbolizes the light, enthusiasm, courage, and wisdom of life, in a word, it also symbolizes Sportsmanship. Prometheus in Greek mythology was the first warrior to steal fire from the sky to the world. Although he suffered the pain of punishment, he can be said to be the first torch relay runner in the world. Although this is a myth, in terms of the development history of human civilization, fire is undoubtedly the origin and driving force of human civilization. Historians have divided human civilization into various eras such as the Stone Age, Bronze Age, Iron Age, and Electrical Age based on the main living tools of human beings, but fire has always been the basic driving force of all ages. Even in the current stage when human civilization is about to enter the atomic age, it is difficult to imagine that human civilization can be separated from the relationship with fire from now on.</p>
<p>Fire symbolizes light and heat, which needs no further explanation. The life source of all living things in our world is fire, because the sun itself is a ball of fire and heat. As for fire being a symbol of wisdom, it is because wisdom must contain light and heat. Wisdom enlightens idiocy, and light drives away darkness. If there is no fire in people's hearts and no light in the world, what hope is there for human life!</p>
<p>However, fire is also considered to be the most terrible thing. A single spark can start a prairie fire, and the losses caused by fires around the world every year are incalculable. And the most terrible thing is the fire of war. The same is a spark. In the hands of the god of wisdom, Prometheus, it symbolizes light and wisdom, but in the hands of the god of war, Mars, it symbolizes darkness and destruction. The hell in the mouth of religious people is a sea of fire, but it is completely destructive fire, and it is fire that destroys humanity.</p>
<p>People have such different views on fire, not because fire is really different, but because of the different ways people deal with fire. Fire is a kind of power. Only when people know how to use this power well, fire is a kind of good and bright power. Otherwise, playing with fire will burn you. There is a clear warning in ancient times that fire cannot be played with!</p>
<p>This time the National Games gathered athletes from all over the country in one hall. They can all be said to be the fire of our nation. There are many young people from remote provinces and overseas Chinese, who are still visiting the heart of the motherland for the first time. I believe that they must have the same enthusiasm and hope for the motherland as fire. Whether or not to win the championship is a secondary issue. What is important is how to make these young men and women who come with enthusiasm be able to take a good impression of the motherland back.</p>
<p>Although the motherland is currently in a war, this National Games is not an embellishment to whitewash peace, because the participation of athletes from all over the country this time is out of spontaneous enthusiasm. Many athletes have stated that they are not thinking about winning the championship this time, because whoever the championship belongs to is the same glory, which is slightly different from the meaning of the World Games. The main purpose of their long journey this time is to want to get closer to the motherland and learn more about the motherland. It is really touching that young people from remote provinces and overseas Chinese have such eager love for the motherland.</p>
<p>If the young people of China have eager love for the country, China will always have hope. Although some foreigners regard the current China as already in incurable chaos, for example, the "World Travel and Trade Guide" recently published by the New York Herald Tribune has listed China as a "problem area". But as long as every young person in China believes that his motherland has hope, then the temporary impressions of outsiders are not worth caring about.</p>
<p>The National Games can gather thousands of young people from all over the country in one hall, which tells the world: Although China is currently in chaos, it seems that Chinese young people are always inseparably connected to the motherland in spirit, and they always have the same enthusiasm for the motherland as fire. Even if domestic transportation is frequently destroyed, they still come from thousands of miles away. It can be said that the scale is not as good as the World Games held in London, but the meaning it expresses is fundamentally different from the World Games that completely wants to attract foreign tourists and thereby wants to absorb foreign exchange.</p>
<p>The torch relay starting from the gate of the Presidential Palace in the capital is in the form of transmitting a message, but in fact it implies that a new bright torch will ignite the fire in the hearts of every people. From the unity of the youth of the whole country, we will further achieve the peace and unity of China! At least I personally hope so.</p>

<p>— Xu Ren (許人)</p>
<p>"Arc de Triomphe (凱旋門)" by Remarque, the author of "All Quiet on the Western Front", is one of the best literary works of the year. It has recently been translated by Zhu Wen (朱雯) and published by Culture and Life Publishing House (文化生活出版社). Now, I will briefly quote some of the quotable good sentences from it.</p>
<p>Describing stateless exiles: "They don't know where to go, but the next morning, before you wake up, they have already left. At that time, they knew where to go."</p>
<p>On women: "Women in the world, if they are not abandoned, they should be respected. There is no middle ground."</p>
<p>On life and death: "Living things can move - they have strength, demeanor, and absurdity - but they will not have the strange solemnity that those things that can never move again and will only rot have. Only complete things will have this characteristic: and humans can only achieve completion in death - and time is also very short."</p>
<p>About character: "Cynics often have noble character, while idealists tend to be unreliable."</p>
<p>I have tasted books, especially literary masterpieces, are like a famous dish. You must taste them yourself before you can know their merits, because they also have the three conditions of color, fragrance, and taste. The introducer can only describe its color and fragrance at most. If you want to know its taste, you cannot taste it on behalf of others.</p>
<h3 id="e124">Zhao Gu Ni <a href="#e124" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c124" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">124</a></h3>
<p>— Qian Dacheng</p>
<p>In recent times, many calligraphers in the Jiangnan region favored imitating Weng Tonghe, the Grand Secretary. However, Zhao Gu Ni of Changshu was the foremost in capturing the essence of his style and being able to create genuine likenesses. Gu Ni, named Shi, styled himself Shi Nong, and also went by the sobriquet Ni Daoren. He was a native of Xitang Town. In his youth, he followed his father selling medicine in the village of Jincun County. There were medical skill contests in the village, and those who ranked high would receive prize money. Those who ranked last were given a picul of vegetable oil, encouraging them to burn the midnight oil and diligently practice, which was essentially intended as mockery. Most who ranked last were filled with shame and indignation and would often refuse to take the oil. Gu Ni initially participated in the contest and ended up in last place. He carried home the picul of vegetable oil, ignoring the mockery of the crowd. Several months later, he participated again and won first place, surprising everyone. A tofu shop owner in the neighborhood smiled and said to the crowd, "This young man didn't succeed by luck! Every night, when I get up to grind tofu, I see a light shining in his house. Looking in, I see him practicing calligraphy. He is so diligent and self-motivated; how could he not succeed?" The crowd then sighed in admiration.</p>
<p>At that time, there was a madman named Jin in Jincun who was skilled in seal carving. Gu Ni asked him to carve a stone seal, but Jin scolded him, saying, "You want me to carve seals for you?" Gu Ni was indignant and learned seal carving from Jin Youzhu Yi, and his reputation gradually increased. Later, he went to the home of Shen Shiyou in the city (Shiyou's name was Rujin; he specialized in collecting antique inkstones, was skilled in poetry, and authored the "Ming Jian Bai Zhai Poetry Collection"). Shiyou was close friends with Wu Changshuo. Changshuo occasionally visited Changshu, and Gu Ni was able to study under Changshuo, becoming even more skilled in engraving and mastering calligraphy, painting, porcelain, bronze, jade, and stone. At that time, Grand Secretary Weng Tonghe had been dismissed from his post and was living at home, not associating with gentry officials, but only interacting with commoners. Gu Ni often visited him and gained the Grand Secretary's favor, studying the Grand Secretary's calligraphy style and sometimes even writing for him. As the Grand Secretary was dying, he gave Gu Ni two of his personal seals, indicating his intention to pass on his legacy. Gu Ni's imitations of Weng's calligraphy spread throughout Jiangnan, becoming indistinguishable from the original. Once his reputation was established, he no longer did it. The Weng calligraphy imitations of others were merely clumsy scribbles.</p>
<p>In his later years, Gu Ni's reputation increased. High-ranking officials and nobles would ask him to carve seals, and he would haggle over every penny, never catering to their desires. He was trustworthy and dependable with commoners, keeping his word and honoring his commitments. He was willing to spend a thousand gold pieces for them. He was particularly close to Mr. Yang Wuyi of the same town. They once went together to the Xiyuan Temple in Suzhou. Many weeping willows grew by the temple, and the two of them stood listening to the singing of orioles all day. Others laughed at their obsession, but they did not care.</p>
<p>Gu Ni had a beautiful beard and a dignified appearance. He liked to scold people, and no one dared to argue with him. Mr. Yu Youren of Sanyuan visited Yushan and called on Gu Ni. They sipped tea together at Xiaoyao You (a teahouse in Changshu, now a hospital), and the two sat facing each other, their appearances so similar that people looked at them as if they were immortals.</p>
<p>Gu Ni had an extremely eccentric personality. When he had malaria, the doctor told him to avoid certain foods, but he would eat those foods anyway and refuse to take medicine, so his illness worsened. He summoned relatives and friends to bid farewell, asked someone to write his epitaph and eulogy, eager to see them before he died. He built his tomb on the western slope of Yushan, calling it "Jinshi Kan," after his wife's surname, Jin. He left instructions for a simple funeral, with only a three-inch-thick paulownia coffin. His family was able to follow his instructions. He had no sons, but his daughter, Lin, was able to carry on his legacy. (Editor's note: The daughter of Mr. Gu Ni is skilled in calligraphy and married the son of the famous calligrapher Xiao Tuiguan.) Gu Ni once said to her, "All miscellaneous skills must have books in your heart. Only with books can you approach the ancients... The method of imitating seals is easily obtained by seeking knowledge from inscriptions and seal scripts. It is difficult to succeed by merely buying tools. After the Six Dynasties, although seal scripts were skillfully crafted, they were often too graceful and could not be incorporated into seals. When Deng Wanbai created seals, his white-character seals did not go beyond the boundaries of the Han dynasty; he was good at about fifteen or sixteen of them. His red-character seals were more original, but too graceful; he was good at about twelve or thirteen of them. My seals cannot be like Wu Changshuo's, who learned nothing but the ancients, thus becoming a master of his generation..." His words are like this, not only discussing seal carving, but also revealing his character.</p>

<p>— Ruzi</p>
<p>Music is not only for entertainment, but it is also a medicine. Relaxing music encourages people to work harder, surpassing all good medicine.</p>
<p>The famous French psychiatrist Esquirol said, "Music has a very significant effect on the human body and mind. I often use it in the treatment of mental illnesses. It can soothe patients, calm their minds, and it is a most powerful therapeutic factor, not to be easily ignored."</p>
<p>Whenever British statesman Gladstone felt tired, he would ask someone to sing his favorite songs. When philosopher Spencer felt nerve pain, he would lie quietly and listen to relaxing music, and the pain would often be relieved.</p>

<p>— Bai Jiao</p>
<p>The maid worries about the ink, I'm sad to strike the ink,</p>

<p>Wanting to despise the orthodox way to the world,</p>
<p>Which noble family would allow such lofty pride?</p>
<p>Plowing and hunting year after year, guarding the inkstone field,</p>
<p>A bald head in Dazhong sleeps poorly.</p>
<p>A rotten heart remains beyond frost-covered hair,</p>
<p>Warm sunshine on the Jiangnan in the fourth month.</p>
<p>This meaning needs no further discussion,</p>
<p>A spiritual root not suited to sprout at the gate.</p>
<p>The master lies planning a mountain tour,</p>
<p>Carelessly adding moss to complement bamboo shoots.</p>
<p>Advise you not to speak your true feelings,</p>
<p>Wine is in the clear goblet, the moon is in the pavilion.</p>
<p>The recluse cultivates fragrance, the monk enjoys tranquility,</p>
<p>Suddenly seeing the spring blooming all at once. (Written for Professor Jin Banguang, the Venerable Monk, a small scroll better than a quatrain)</p>
<p>Burning paper, calling smoke with a yawn and stretch,</p>
<p>No plan to move mountains, only wine as a friend.</p>
<p>The clear essence of the universe has always been here,</p>
<p>Drunken hair in the Xiang River, spring under the brush.</p>
<h3 id="e127">The Story of Solar Eclipses <a href="#e127" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c127" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">127</a></h3>
<p>— Yalong</p>
<p>"In the ninth month, at the beginning of the moon, the sun did not meet in Fang. The officers beat the drums, the officials ran, and the astronomers of the Xi and He clans neglected their duties, knowing nothing, and caused darkness in the sky, offending the kings of the past. The law says: those who predict too early shall be killed without mercy, and those who predict too late shall be killed without mercy." This is the earliest record of a solar eclipse in our country, recorded in the Book of Documents. The Xi and He clans were the two major clans that specialized in astronomy during the Tang, Yu, and Xia dynasties. They were very knowledgeable in astronomy. However, during the reign of Zhongkang of the Xia dynasty, they failed to fulfill their duties and did not predict the date of this solar eclipse in advance, causing panic among the people of the country. Some beat drums, some shot arrows, trying to save the sun. Later, those two "derelict" astronomers were sentenced to death, because according to the law at that time, those who predicted too late or too early were to be punished by death. It can be seen that the study of astronomy at that time had already achieved considerable success.</p>
<p>In a place called Rietvlei in South Africa, there was a total solar eclipse. Afterward, the miners demanded double pay from the mine owners, arguing that they had worked for two days, even though the night in between was very short. In the end, they were victorious.</p>
<p>Thales, the astronomer who was the first of the Seven Sages of ancient Greece, once used a solar eclipse to resolve a war. In 585 BC, the Medes and Lydians had been at war for several years without a victor. Thales predicted that there would be a solar eclipse, and announced to both armies, "Heaven is tired of war and will display a solar eclipse to warn everyone." Later, when the two sides were fiercely fighting, the daytime suddenly turned into night. The soldiers on both sides then believed that Heaven was truly tired of war and made peace.</p>
<p>In 310 BC, the Sicilian people were being chased by the Carthaginians. Their leader, Agathocles, took sixty warships and fled to the sea that night. At dawn, there was a solar eclipse, the light disappeared again, and the stars reappeared. Agathocles announced to his subordinates, "The solar eclipse is a sign of change, a symbol of our turning defeat into victory." The crowd believed him, and morale was restored. Six days later, the Sicilian banners were planted on Carthaginian land.</p>

<h3 id="e129">Urging People to Stop Spitting <a href="#e129" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c129" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">129</a></h3>
<p>— Tan Ke</p>
<p>On the utility poles by the roadside, there are white signs with black characters that say, "Spitting harms people and spreads tuberculosis." But if you stroll along the street, you will encounter people leisurely spitting wherever they please.</p>
<p>It seems that someone once said that our Chinese people's attitude towards things is mostly casual. When their heart leads them, they can't care about anything else. Although they know that spitting harms people, when phlegm is in their throat, they must spit it out. The arrival of phlegm is not restricted by time or space, so they spit whenever it comes, without considering where the phlegm will fall. Anyway, it has nothing to do with them.</p>
<p>Our country's legends about ghosts and gods have always been taken "very seriously." When people hear that something should not be done, and if done, the ghosts and gods will deal with you in such and such a way, they are afraid of how the ghosts and gods will deal with them, so they don't do it. Unfortunately, the saying "Do not spit" was not attached to some ghostly words by our ancestors thousands of years ago. Otherwise, would we still need to put up signs everywhere to urge people to stop? They would have stopped on their own long ago!</p>
<p>But then again, adding "ghostly words" to the urging not to do something is originally the cleverness of the persuader. They have grasped humanity's weakness—self-interest—and then "ghostified" it. Doing it is not beneficial to oneself, so those with a strong sense of self-interest cautiously avoid doing it. If you don't believe me, try changing the sign urging people not to spit to "Spitting harms people, may Heaven and Earth punish you," and it will definitely be effective.</p>

<p>Antiques, "rarity makes them valuable," caters to human curiosity. Therefore, regardless of whether the person or event associated with the item is virtuous or foolish, superior or inferior, as long as the item itself is fun and rare, it can be considered a rare commodity. It is said that leaving behind fragrances and leaving behind hidden treasures each has its own merits.</p>
<p>For example, Yan Song of the Ming Dynasty, a treacherous official who harmed the people and the country, has been condemned by the official history with an axe, and dramas and novels have also vividly described him, cursed by all. However, the plaques of several old shops in old Beijing, such as "Liu Bi Ju" and "He Nian Tang," which are said to have been written by Yan Fenyi, are actually praised by everyone as miracles. Another example is Yuan Shikai's "Hongxian Emperor," who not only betrayed the Republic of China, but also made a short dream of eighty-three days, causing laughter everywhere. However, his specially made porcelain, with the marks "Made in the Hongxian Year" and "Made in Jurentang," is priced the same as famous kilns of the Qianlong and Jiaqing periods, because only one batch was made, and the "imperial reign" ended. There are not many genuine products, and the workmanship is quite exquisite. His imperial flags, imperial seals, etc., are displayed in the Historical Museum on the Meridian Gate of the Forbidden City, along with the Heavenly King's seal of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom, relics of Hong Xiuquan and Yang Xiuqing, and ancient tripods and vessels of the Zhou, Qin, Han, and Song dynasties, each occupying a part of historical relics. (In June of the Tongzhi Jiazi year of the Qing Dynasty, Zeng Guoquan's army entered Nanjing and obtained Hong's Heavenly King's seal, which he presented to his brother Guofan. Guofan first used high-quality jade pages of paper printed with fifty pages, then presented the original seal and other spoils of war to the Qing court. Zeng Gong distributed the printed copies to capable generals as souvenirs and personally added inscriptions. During the Guangxu years, the former generals gradually declined and often sold the "seal" pieces they received as antiques, each piece worth five or six hundred taels of gold, more expensive than ancient paintings of the Song and Ming dynasties. After obtaining this seal, the Qing court also treasured it in the palace. Therefore, after the Republic of China, all antiques were received from the Qing imperial family, and this seal was still intact and displayed in the museum for everyone to see. If the Qing dynasty had not fallen, this seal would still be a treasured secret within the imperial palace.)</p>
<p>Last winter, I read in the West Electric News that European and American philatelists are buying French "Vichy" stamps at very high prices. The "Vichy government" was a "puppet organization" formed in 1940 when Marshal Pétain (also translated as Petain) signed a peace treaty with Germany. After the Allied victory in 1945, the Vichy authorities were all arrested and executed. There is no doubt that the stamps they issued were "counterfeit stamps." However, although they cannot be used for general circulation, they are interesting to collect because counterfeit objects cannot be obtained again and are enough to be considered Curio.</p>
<p>In August of the 34th year, one year after Japan announced its surrender, counterfeit goods were being sold everywhere in old Beijing. No one wanted anything from "Manchukuo" or "Jidong" even at low prices. Sellers were afraid of being scolded, so they had to hide in remote alleys and empty fields to peddle their wares and were often met with disdain, which was a reflection of accumulated resentment and righteousness. But in the last two years, "counterfeit" goods have become scarce and have become "rare commodities." Things that were once disgusting and hateful have turned into Curio that are fun to play with and collect. This is not a change in "people's" perceptions, but a change in the nature of the "objects." Originally, during the puppet era of "Manchukuo" and "Jidong," although they were merely actors in costumes, they put on a full display. They manufactured things like "commemorative items for the founding of the country," "ceremony albums," and "silverware," and the Japanese who were pulling the strings behind the scenes were skilled in engineering techniques, helping to decorate them with splendor and beauty. Therefore, documents and goods signed by "Kangde" (Puyi's reign title in "Manchukuo") had the potential to follow in the footsteps of "Yuan Huang Hongxian." Zheng Xiaoxu, the puppet prime minister, was originally a famous scholar known for his calligraphy. He died in 1938, having served as a "founding hero" of the puppet state for six or seven years, writing many albums related to "ceremonies." These have now become rare items, more valuable than his calligraphy albums before he became a "traitor." This is not valuing "treachery," but valuing its Curio nature.</p>
