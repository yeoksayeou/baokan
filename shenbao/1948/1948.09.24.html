<h3>建立鋁工業之絕好來源　閩發現鐵礬土礦　美礦務局極重視已編成報吿</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕華盛頓廿三日廣播：據美國礦務局報吿稱：最近在中國東南沿海福建省境內發見之鐵　土礦藏，將使中國獲得建立鋁工業所需原料之絕好來源。該局根據美國駐滬領事館經濟分析家克林翰所編報吿，對中國輕金屬工業加以研究，而作成上項報吿。據資源委員會礦務局報吿載稱：福建省鑛床內貯有五十萬噸含鋁礦質。美鑛務局稱：中國在戰前向由荷屆東印度羣島等處輸入鐵礬土，以應國內需要，耗去不少外匯，為節省此項外匯起見，自必設法礬土之國內供應，俾達到自給自足之目的。中國浙·皖·遼·冀·魯·滇等省均產有礬土，惜尚未充分開發，其貯藏量亦未加以估計。目前中國對鋁之需要較小，每年約五千至一萬噸，但在戰時被燬以及日人經營之工廠全部恢復以後，鋁之需要必大為增加。</p>

<h3>中硏院院士會議蔣總統致詞全文　以五點希望祝學術進步</h3>
<p>〔中央社南京廿三日電〕總統今在中研院院士會議致詞，原文如次：</p>
<p>今日為中央研究院院士初次集會之日，此固為中國學術界之幸事，亦為國家之幸事。</p>
<p>中央研究院設置已廿年，至今年始有院士之選舉與集會，其設置在國家定都南京之初，正為北伐後建國重要方針之一，而院士之選舉至廿年始舉行者，誠因日寇之侵略，軍事期間，不易顧及文敎修明之長策久計，亦因學術進展之道，每一步驟，須待時機之成熟，若時機未熟而為之，亦易生流弊。中央研究院積廿年之經歷，始克為此，足徵其逐步進展，實事求是。查各國國家學院之先例，每選院士或會員以為主體，而後研究工作，因緣發展。中央硏究院設置硏究所於廿年之前，設置甚具全國性之評議會於十三年之前，在今日則全國性之院士會成立，似反其一般之次序者，此正中央研究院初創之時，中國各種學術，未如十年後之發展，故常時選舉院士之條件未備，近十年中雖以日寇之故，學術事業深受其影饗，然若干科目，仍在穩進途中，故今日乏為此事，正所謂水到渠成也。中央研究院創辦之始，先立此穩進之計，此誠為前院長蔡孑民先生之遠見，而中央研究院之能吸收人才，樹立成績者，亦非蔡孑民先生德望不足以濟此。</p>
<p>今年選舉之院士，實為一國之彥，自茲集會之後，國家有其代表性之學院，而與世界之學院合作共進，值茲良機，願將吾所希望者，為諸君言之</p>
<p>其一，提高學術水準，今日全國之大學，以數目論，遠增於前，此固應建國之需要，然欲求其各能發揮敎監之功能，成就學術之任務，則為日尚遠。求學術之進展，必先立其模範，樹之風聲，然後因其影響所及，有着遍之進步，諸君各於所習之科，已為國人所認許，今後必更於所專之業，力增其發見與發明，期之十年，不難如國父所言，向科學先進國家迎頭趕上。</p>
<p>其二，流布學術成績，中國遠事姑不具論，明淸兩代，雖無近代性之學院，而其文物流布，在當時世界各國未之能及，明代有永樂大典之纂輯，淸代有圖書集成之纂輯，明代有經廠之刋書，淸代有四庫之編定，今日學術之範圍遠廣於前，民國學術，更宜求其超越昔日，各有鴻編鉅製，旣以啓迪國人之智慧，亦以宣揚國家之文敎于世界也。</p>
<p>其三，提倡科學合作，科學之淮步，旣由於自由的發展，亦憑諸合理之計劃，在近代科學發展之初期，前者為重，在今日設備與組織為工作所必需，故求大量之成績，不可不有合理之計劃，此非一人之事，亦每非一學校，一機關之事，必集中力量於一設計，然後可期其有成就，欲求計劃合理而有效，必求之於精湛之才，欲其依計劃而合作，更待學林之人望，此實為君等之責任也。</p>
<p>其四，與列國學院溝通其學術，中國今日旣有此具代表性之國家學術圈體，則與各國學院合作，當比往者更為方便，凡此合作之事，無論其為事業之合作或人才之交換，均可影響國內科學界，藉以促進學術之進步，不僅為國家敦鄰邦條睦誼之用而已。</p>
<p>其五·為國家建設致其力，近代國家之建設無處不憑學術之進展，故學術落後者，國家亦落後，國家求進步，學術須先進步，今日之社會中，凡事之涉及衣食住行，以及生養疾病者，在在需要科學知識，助其改進，今日之國家中，無論其為農業推進，工業建設或軍事設置，亦在在需要科學知識，以立其基本，我國之建設事項，何啻萬端，均以科學之落後，其前途甚為遼遠，而時代之需要，更為迫切，從事於此，固全國人之事，而賃獻其學識，領導其途路，在諸君之責任尤重，建設近代的中國，卽為建設科學的中國，此必君等與余同其感想者，余尤望諸君於建設之事，同心而赴，協力以成。</p>
<p>值茲良會，略談我所希望者，藉以祝此會之成功，並以祝中國學術之進步。（中研院院士會議消息請參閱第七版）</p>

<p>社論</p>
<h3>正視東南亞的危機</h3>
<p>印尼共黨於十九日發動政變，佔領東爪哇的工業中心馬迪恩城，該黨領袖慕紗嗣即宣佈「爪哇蘇維埃共和國」的成立，自任為此一紅色政權的「總統」，並假馬迪恩電台呼籲印尼人民，羣起推翻索卡諾總統所領導的共和政府。因此，印尼共和政府便不得不背棄新憲法上的規定，把非常的獨裁權力授與索卡諾總統，以戡平印尼共黨的暴力叛變。所以荷印戰爭的血跡未乾，而今又到了內戰爆發的邊緣。這不僅是印尼人民的不幸，而且也是東南亞的警鐘。所謂「一落葉知天下秋」，東南亞的危機，實在不容我們忽視的了！</p>
<p>東南亞的危機醞釀已久，在第二次世界大戰結束之後，東南亞各國，例如印尼，緬甸，越南，暨馬來亞等，無不受世界潮流的激蘯，而渴望自由與獨立。荷印的衝突，法越的紛爭，都是在這種時代的意義上發生的。可是二三年來，均未能獲得澈底的合理解決，足以滿足各國人民的願望；在失望的情緒中，自然容易走上偏激的道路。美聯合社新加坡電稱，據英國外交家寇士特說，「共產主義在印尼的勃起，完全由於印尼人民對美國政策深感失望所致」。這句話，可謂「一針見血」之談，值得列強深切反省的。尤其是與東南亞有直間利害關係的英，法，荷三國，對於現行政策，不可不改絃易轍的了。</p>
<p>放眼看看東南亞的實際情形，各地共黨的騷亂，自共產國際情報局東南亞支部於五月間在遞京曼谷成立以來，因有中心的領導，也就愈趨積極。到了現在，大有「一發而不可抑制」之勢。遞京曼谷既成為東南亞共黨活動的大本營，緬甸也有向左轉的傾向，緬甸總理泰金諾曾公然宣佈，「願使全國蘇維埃化」，實在太駭人聽聞了。至於在印度，共黨在工農之中，向來擁有極大的潛力，本年一月間也曾在加爾各答鼓勵火車工人罷工，幸賴尼赫魯的積極清共，始能將印共的騷動迫入地下。但在馬來亞的情形，却較任何地方為嚴重。共黨潛伏在橡樹園內，到處沽動，暗殺，搶劫，縱火等等，無所不用其極，使英國駐馬來亞專員甘德爵士不得不宣佈緊急狀態存在，並大捕共產匪徒，使英國共黨也說：「殖民戰爭已在馬來亞開始了」。最近尼印共黨實行暴力政變，更有「後來居上」之勢。</p>
<p>東南亞的危機，早為輿論界所重視。例如：英國曼徹斯特導報於六月間評述亞洲局勢，就主張「防止共黨在亞洲發展，厥在經濟援助亞洲各國。」美國衆議院外交委員會主席伊頓於七月初旬也說：「亞洲與遠東較歐洲各國更為危險；蘇聯的真正擴張將以亞洲各國為其目標。」衆議員周以德更指出「共產黨已在亞洲方面發動決定性的攻勢。」但在英美官方，一直保持緘默，至本月十五日貝文外相始在下議院宣稱：「共產國際發動攻勢，企圖將西方勢力逐出，東南亞局勢的發展，最近已開其端。……彼等不獨欲使緬甸及馬來亞盡入共黨佔領範圍，抑且使世界每一個角落，均有此種騷動與不安的現象。」同時，荷蘭外長史蒂克也鑒於東南亞的危機日深，乃前往華府與馬歇爾面商對策，內容如何雖不可知，但在美荷之間必已成立協議，殆可斷言。列強的逐漸重視東南亞的危機，也已益見明朗了。</p>
<p>要之，共產黨勢力一方面步步向西歐緊迫，柏林危機的無法解決，固已顯示出歐洲情勢的緊張；但在另一方面，它也同時向東南亞發動攻勢，造成整個亞洲的騷動與不安，企圖利用英美忽視東南亞危機的錯覺，不費吹灰之力而達成其任務。果爾，則其結果，不僅西方民主國家在東南亞的經濟利益將深受影響，而且在政治上軍略上，也將遭受重大打擊。所以我們在印尼共黨暴力政變之後，要喚起英美法荷等國的注意，東南亞的危機日深，切不可因柏林的危機而忽視東南亞的重要性。但挽救東南亞的危機之道，應為各自重行考慮其對東南亞的政策，過去那種對付殖民地的政策及作風，當不能適用於今日這個時代。印尼的警鐘已在響了，豈可自欺欺人，一誤再誤？我們希望列強的政治外交家對於東南亞的危機，能迅作明智的抉擇！</p>
<h3>成由勤儉敗由奢　九十老將薩鎮冰　擁護勸建運動　勗勉同胞摒絕奢華概念</h3>
<p>〔中央社福州廿三日電〕總高望重，一生勤儉自持，現九十高齡之海軍耆宿薩鎮冰將軍，對總統發起勤儉建國運動，極表衷心擁護。當記者往訪，叩詢意見時，渠稱：「成由勤儉敗由奢」，自古已然，我國國民素以勤儉著稱，惟晚近社會風氣頹敗，一般習尚奢華，養尊處優，花天酒地，致正當收入，不能維持其奢侈生活，乃發生茍取貪污之行為，造成社會不良風氣，氏認為總統英睿之倡呼，實為今日全國國民應澈底景從者。薩老謂：我十一歲入馬段海軍學堂攻讀，當時家境貧困，上有父母，下有一妹，時每月所得，學餉大洋五元五角，除自用四角外，餘均寄歸家用，蓋如不勤儉節省，吾家生活將無以維持矣。渠　喻今日國家情形，有苦一大家　，短紬家用，必須作為子弟者之全國人民，人人節衣縮食，共同合力匡濟。渠雖為我國海軍界聲望隆者之人物，名震寰宇，且歷任中樞高位，然當老年退休時，一無恒產，現在住處，係由閩中人士捐贈之「人壽堂」，陋屋三間，布衣素食，終日但握管揮毫，潤華所得，悉以救濟貧民，致閩人僉稱渠為：「活菩薩」。渠勗勉同胞稱：「我不吸烟，不飲酒，不吃肉，不賭博，精神亦不見如何痛苦，且身體頗健，活到今年已九十歲，茍大家能立意摒絕奢華概念，勤儉節約，不但利己，實亦利國」。渠月前受託賑濟榕市水災災民，躬親挨戶放賑，榕市街頭，時見老人安步而行，從不乘車，公共紀念集會場中內立數小時，神態怡然。以其九十高齡，猶克勤克儉，茹苦如飴，誠難能可貴，殊足為吾人典範。又閩省各界人士，為響應總統發起勤儉節約建國運動，已籌備組織省會指導委會，各縣市組設推行委會，榕市在鄉軍官會集議，徵訂厲行方式，以為倡導。</p>

<h3>馬歇爾正吿世界各國　強調人權應胎神尊重　希望早日締結日奧和約聯大會一般辯論昨開始</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社巴黎廿三日電〕聯合國大會今日開始一般辯論。菲律賓代表羅慕洛以英語發表演說，呼籲大國從新努力，對目前之各項歧見，覓取和平解決辦法，使人類有機會在聯合國機構中達到更鞏固之安全保障，以謀造成對世界任何人之福利。又稱，小國能以共同努力及集體力量，作為擁執和平之第三種勢力，以協助大國阻止戰爭。過去數週中粕林係世界人士注意之中心迨至今日以及在聯合國大會開會期間巴黎將為仳人注意之中心羅慕洛復强調稱，此次聯大會係在世界史上最重要之時期召開，而此次會議亦將決定世界和戰之命遝。</p>
<p>〔合衆社巴黎廿三日電〕繼羅慕各之後美國務卿馬歇爾起立發言，嚴正聲明美國不願在主要原則上妥協，而「將其他人民之權利及自由，作為貨品交易而予以斷送。」</p>
<p>馬歇爾在演說中，反映羅氏之戰爭警報。渠引證聯合國憲章保證挽救子子孫孫脫離戰爭之火海，「然吾人非唯具有拯援子孫之需要，吾人今日亦須挽救本身。」馬卿對柏林問題雙字不題，渠繼稱，「美國不願在目前局面中火上加油，美國衷心渴望減輕國際緊張。」渠籲請各會員國覓致改善局面之方法，又警吿稱，舉世芸芸衆生，正喁喁而望此間之重要會議，「吾人不應令若輩失望。」渠將世間困難諉諸「有系統及處心積慮下否定基本人權。」雖不直指蘇聯兩字，渠稱，「數百萬男女每日生活於秘警之恐怖下，隨時有被捕被禁及强迫服役之慮，實係錯誤之至。」馬氏再稱，過去一年中，聯合國之工作頗著成效，「然縱然大多數國家願意合作，重建和平福祉，過去一年中局勢竟每况愈下，某數國之執政者在其本國及世界間製造深闊鴻溝，吾人實不能容許此一鴻溝之更形擴大。」馬氏否認締造和平，僅為大國之事，藎涉及無數政府及無數國人民。「在需要解決之問題上，大小國家均須各抒意見，求舉世公論。」馬卿演說重心在於尊重個人自由及權利之需要。渠竭力陳請聯大以「壓倒多數」通過人權宣言草案。渠警吿「凡有系統殘害本國人民權利之政府，必不尊重他國及他人之權利，且必致以國際性恫嚇武力求達到目的。」</p>
<h3>處理各項問題求達和平目標</h3>
<p>隊籲請通過人權宣言外，渠稱美國圓獲致下列目標，而此亦卽聯大之目標：</p>
<p>巴勒斯坦　建立無戰爭及戰爭威脅之巴勒斯坦，阿猶兩族均有和平發展之保障，准許外約但及以色列參加聯合國。</p>
<p>朝鮮　獨立統一之朝鮮，由聯合國承認為聯合國，朝鮮人自由選舉，產生憲法及政府。</p>
<p>希臘　希臘應不受外來之非法侵略所損害。</p>
<p>印尼　印尼不應再流血，雙方談判解決一切。</p>
<p>印巴之爭　關於喀什米爾，印度及巴基斯坦兩大國應繼續調停折衝。</p>
<p>原子能　應早日通過管制原子能之國際系統。</p>
<p>軍縮　在可靠適當之保障下，累進儘速縮軍。</p>
<p>馬歇爾演說完竣，蘇聯代表團默然端坐，不願鼓掌助威。馬氏並對世界危局提出三大點：</p>
<p>第一，美國將在「適宜機構內」竭其全力以解決現局。第二，「吾人如希望和平，吾人必須解決因上次大戰引起之問題。」第三，世界應努力「早日及公平」締造德日奧和約。</p>
<p>馬氏言語溫和，絕不感情衝動，適與蘇聯集團第一個發言人波蘭代表莫契萊夫斯基相反。莫氏大舉批評柏林空輸，稱之謂「荒謬之空中橋梁」，而以飛機運煤斤入柏林亦為「經濟上之謬論」。渠亦猛烈斥譽馬歇爾計劃為重建西德成為西方之衛星，「俾重起侵略」，使德國成為其「主子之利器，反動及轉向之前哨，戰阪征服世界之跳板」。</p>
<h3>委內瑞拉埃及　兩代表發言</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕巴黎廿三日廣播：聯大會廿三日下午續開會議，委內瑞拉外長發言贊成「小型大會」繼續存在，並主張安理會否決權應受限制。埃及外長指斥猶太移民聖地，威脅中東及世界和平。至是，伊伐特宣吿大會延至明晨再開。</p>
<h3>貝那多特建議猶方不全贊同</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社巴黎廿二日電〕以色列列席聯合國大會之非正式委員團發言人，今日在招待記者會中聲稱：貝那多特報吿中主張承認以色列之獨立，殊可滿意，惟以色列政府不能完全接受該報吿中之決議，以色列政府尤其反對違反前聯合國調查委員會之主張，而議將尼吉夫劃出以色列之版圖。</p>
<h3>大會議程　包括七十項目　綜合委會進行商討</h3>
<p>〔中央社巴黎廿二日電〕綜合包括議案七十項之臨時議程中、舉凡巴勒斯坦·韓國·巴爾幹·安理會否決權等聯合國最困難之問題，莫不包含在內，綜委會今以大部時間，辭論何事應包括　程內，何事應予劇除而將議程送交大會正式通過。蘇代表維辛斯基於會中，譴斥西方國家企圖造成一「不團結」之聯合國，惟蘇聯會一再努力企圖將韓國·希臘·安理會否決權，及新會員國入會等問題，不交大會討論，但終遭綜合委會以大多數否決。本年之議程包括原有議案四十五項，補充議案二十項，最後提出之議案五項，包括巴勒斯坦問題，義殖民地問題及聯合國警衛隊問題。按蘇聯一貫作風，於辯論進行時，於大會提出重大問題，本年亦可能如是。</p>
<h3>法全國勞工罷工兩小時</h3>
<p>政府允工人增資要求</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕倫敦廿三日廣播巴黎訊：法政府廿三日決定允准法工人增加工資百分之十五。此項增加之成數，較共黨及非共黨工會所要求者為小。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社巴黎廿三日電〕法國兩小時之象徽罷工，將於廿四日下午四時至六時，在全國各城市舉行。巴黎全市公共交通運輸將完全停頓，市政府及一切公用事業俱將停工。</p>
<h3>三強作最後嘗試　致蘇新照會　要求解决柏林事件</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社已黎廿二日電〕英美法三國政府今日再向莫斯科提出關於柏林問題之新照會。三國在照會中同意法外長之建議，卽德國問題暫緩向聯合國提出，而繼續由四國協商，而協商之問題限於柏林之封鎖，以及柏林幣制在四國共管下求取統一。但西方國家官員確信蘇方答覆如不能令人滿意，則必在聯合國中全面辯論柏林問題。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社倫敦廿二日電〕貝文今日在下院宣稱，「英國認為蘇聯開放柏林之封鎖，為解決柏林問題之主要條件。西方三國不僅對柏林政策完全一致，且在談判失敗後三國應作何處置，亦已得一致協議。如說英國欲求戰爭，實為大錯，我們仍希望德國統一政府遲早能吿成立」。述及美蘇關係時，貝文稱，「余相信東西雙方必能共存共榮，余已準備共同生活，並請對方亦在「所得之區域內和平過活。」</p>
<h3>印尼政府軍分兵三路　進擊馬迪城共軍　聯合國斡施委會正進行和解</h3>
<p>〔合衆社巴達維亞二十三日電〕二十三日探悉：印尼共和國政府業已開始對東爪哇之共產黨叛軍進擊，政府軍並已進抵距政變中心馬迪城十二英哩之處。共和國官方通訊社安泰拉稱：對共產黨盤踞城市之全面進攻，業於二十一日開始，政府軍正自三路向馬迪城進攻，戰事正在距城六英哩之馬迪機塲四周及距城東北十八英理之納伽威進行。</p>
<p>在馬迪城周圍之共軍，約為三千人左右，渠等並曾在城東二十五英哩之鐵路交軌點納根表附近發動攻勢，但政府軍已將共軍之勁旅之社會主義靑年軍擊潰，並解除武裝，該軍業已向政府投降。又據裘基卡拉電台廣播：政府軍已進抵距馬迪城十二英哩以內之地區，進攻馬城以西之馬其坦，「政府軍將領深信馬迪城之光復，卽在最短期內」。</p>
<p>〔合衆社巴達維亞廿二日電〕印尼廿二日下令禁止十人以上之集會，日惹電台宣佈此項禁令，謂此舉將為緊急時期中之措置。</p>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓廿二日電〕副國務卿羅維特廿二日吿報界稱，荷蘭外長史蒂克最近來此訪問，其意純在與美官員交換意見。問以史氏曾否要求在印尼事件中加以援助，國務院曾否提出此項援助建議，羅氏答稱，史氏向國務院提供許多情報。渠幷未再加說明。問以美國將否採取步驟以協助荷蘭或印尼之國民黨壓制印尼之共黨，羅維特對此不發表意見，但指出美國為聯合國派赴該處之斡旋委員會之委員，該委會正圖拉攏敵對雙方。同時，負責方面指出美政府認為印尼情勢殊屬嚴重。若干官員談稱，現頗有理由可謂共黨攫取東南亞權力之運動，一部份目的係在打擊歐洲復興計劃，彼等解釋稱，若干歐洲國家依賴投資於東南亞之進益，而此項進益已因共黨所發動之不安局勢而吿損失。</p>
<h3>蘇承認共產國際裂痕深刻　促東歐國字團結　南俄召開會議說待證實</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社華盛頓廿二日〕捷克總統高德羣之到　克里米亞，而史達林今亦正在該處休憇，使此間外交家相信莫斯科之衛星國現正在南俄開會。蘇外長莫洛托夫亦可能參加。羅外長安娜飽克夫人與保總理狄米特洛夫今在何處，此間對此頗多濟測，兩國駐美公使館對此均無所表示。</p>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓廿三日電〕莫斯科電台在其最坦白的檢討共產國際間之糾紛中，對蘇聯人民宣稱，彼等可望在蘇聯衛屋國家內，發現更堅强的共產主義阻力。廣播中除提及南斯拉夫與共產國際情報局之破裂外，並述及東歡「新民主國家」內之一般奮鬥。廣播辭以「國際共產主義運動」為題，此間已予收聽，並提供最高級政府官負參考。</p>
<p>廣播中稱，此種黨內之發展，不過為一種苦痛而不足驚異，蘇聯以外之共黨如能擁護蘇聯之領導地位，及遵從「史達林主義」，則必能獲得極大的成功，並將在各處獲勝。</p>
<p>渠稱，狄托與共情局破裂後之公衆意見，實際上已加强了共產主義運動，此一事件促使各地「正確的重估」其環境，並獲得「必要之結論」。蘇聯之協助，為今日東歐趨向共產主義的唯一原因，但很明顯地，「新民主國家」內的階級鬥爭將更趨尖銳，利用階級之阻力，亦將更趨堅强」。國外共黨內之階級鬥爭，現已日趨明顯，兩大陣綫間之鬥爭業已出現，一如吾人以前所經歷者，蓋共產主義之發展，非經過克服機會主義者之奮鬥，不克完成。」</p>
<h3>英外相重返巴黎</h3>

<h3>馬來亞叛亂　英竟歸咎華人</h3>
<p>英人參與推翻　政府運動</p>
<p>〔合衆社倫敦廿二日電〕英殖民部長　斯廿二日在下院稱，馬來亞之左　叛變份子「　　為華人」，渠稱，該處情況現正逐漸歸於控制。平民死亡者約一八六人，其中大部份為拒不協助恐怖份子之華人。恐怖份子斃命者約一五八人，被俘者二百人，被拘待審查者更多。瓊斯佔計恐怖份子為數約三萬五千人，但渠不顧公佈英軍人數，僅謂有一萬七千名特別警察在該處參戰。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社倫敦廿二日電〕美外次梅修稱，若干仰光之綴導，顯示有若干英國人民在參預加倫族之推翻緬甸政府運動，然「英國政府堅決反對是等活動。」</p>
<h3>杜威發表競選演說要求美國大量援華　過去予中國援助殊屬不夠</h3>
<p>〔中央社記者隨杜威競選專車新墨西哥州省會阿爾波市克三日電〕共和黨總統候選人杜威，今晚要求美國加強援華，氏曾撇開其之先凖備之講稿，痛斥美國援華之「無用及不足」，謂「吾人予中國之援助，殊屬不夠，而應大量增加」。按過去一年間，氏曾再三指責美國援華之不足，故衆料彼果一旦當選總統，或將要求國會增加對華之物資財政及羣事援助，俾有助於中國之復興與建設及撲滅共產主義。</p>
<h3>南韓以為北韓軍力強大　蘇撤軍非宣傳攻勢</h3>
<p>〔中央社漢城廿三日電〕蘇聯聲明北韓蘇軍將於明年元旦撤離完竣後，南韓各界旣不表示驚異，亦不表示興奮。一般評論者，均取現實態度，認為蘇方此舉，並非宣傳攻勢。蓋蘇軍自北韓撤退，不但絲毫不損目前蘇聯在韓境之地位，日反使其在國際政治上，居於有利立塲。蘇聯在北韓所訓練之當地軍力，已近廿萬，人民共和國總理金日成於最近施政方針演講中，且强調「人民軍」將以一百萬為目標，藉以抵抗外來侵犯而防衛祖國。似此情形，北韓蘇軍儘可撤退，而毫無所恐懼。日北韓與蘇境毗鄰，必要時蘇軍仍隨時可以增援韓境。其次蘇軍自北韓撤退後，蘇聯可有副使美國撤退南韓美駐軍之理由，結果必使美方與韓國政府屠於難堪之地位。同時，則增强蘇方與北韓政權之地位。又各方所恐懼者，為蘇軍自北韓撤退後，北韓共軍卽將發動「南伐」，蓋是時蘇方與北韓在法理與表面上，已毫無關係。北韓軍南下，不致引起美蘇間之正而衝突也。</p>
<h3>日最大貪汚案　蘆田被牽連</h3>

<p>〔法國新聞社東京廿三日電〕消息靈通觀察家今日預測近代日本史上最大貪污案之一之昭和電工受賄事件，不久以後或將不了了之。因此案中所牽涉之要人極多。法務廳總裁鈴木廿二日稱：如此事果與若干內閣閣員有關，則必使內閣辭職。在鈴木發表聲明以後，大藏大臣栗栖立卽否認渠與蘆田首相兩人與此案有關。</p>
<h3>解決巴勒斯坦阿猶紛爭　貝那多特發建訪全文　阿猶分治確立永久和平　（續完）</h3>
<p>惟聯大會於去年十一月廿九日之決議中有關邊界之種種規定，應做如下修正，藉使其對巴勒斯坦之目前實際情形更為公允，適當，更能予以實施：（一）法魯加以東埃爾瑪奇達爾附近自海濱劃出之一綫以南，卽所謂諾蓋勃巨，應規定為阿拉伯領土（法魯加與埃爾瑪奇達爾兩地均將為阿刺伯領土）。（二）界綫應自法魯加起沿東北偏東方向直達拉恩洛及里達（拉恩洛及里達兩地均將為阿刺伯領土），自里達起，則照聯大十一月廿九日決議所規之界綫。（三）加里利應劃作猶太領土；（C）凡未劃入猶太國國境內之區域，其一切處理，應由阿拉伯聯邦政府會同巴勒斯坦阿拉伯居民負責，但鑒於外約但與巴勒斯坦之歷史關係與共同利益，巴勒斯坦阿拉伯領土及外約但領土殊有合併之理由，至於有關其它阿拉伯各國邊境之修正，如屬可能及必要，則仍應實行。（D）聯合國應以宣言或其它適當方式，提供特別之保證，卽阿猶領土間之界綫，應予以尊重及維持，僅在有關方面相互同意之情形下，始得有所修正。（E）海發港雖包括於猶太國領土之內，海發城雖由猶太國管理，但該港（包括其煉油設備及輸油管終點在內）應宣佈為自由港；保證有關阿拉伯各國可自由接近該港，而阿拉伯各國則不應妨碍石油通過轍油管抵達海發之煉油廠，至於石油之分配則將繼續依照已往辦法辦理。（F）里達航空站應宣佈為自由航空站，保證耶洛撒冷以及有關阿拉伯各國得接近該航空站並使用其設備。（G）耶洛撒冷城所包括之地區應遵照聯大十一月廿九日決議之規定，該城應予以單獨看待，將其置於聯合國有效管制之下，藉使當地阿猶居民享有最大限度而又適當之自治權，俾聖地與其古蹟以及宗敎自由獲得充分保障，並可自由前往。（H）各方面應完全尊重由公路，鐵路或空中自由進入耶洛撒冷之權利。（I）聯合國應確認阿拉伯難民有權儘早返歸其在猶太控制區內之家鄉，而其遺送，重居，經濟與社會之重建以及不願回鄉者財產損失之適當賠償，應由下面（K）節听述之聯合國調解委員會予以監督及協助。（J）當局對於巴勒斯坦猶太領土內一切阿拉伯人及阿拉伯領土內一切猶太人之政治，經濟，社會及宗敎等權利，應予以充分之保障及尊重。下節內所規定之調解委員會應監督此項保陣之執行。該委負會並須應雙方之邀，從事斡旋對於交換居民之任何努力，藉以消除一切麻煩之少數民族問題，而以對財產損失之適當賠償為基礎。（K）臨於巴勒斯坦問題之特別性質及猶阿關係危險之複雜性，聯合國應設立一巴勒斯坦調查委員會。該委員會之委任，有一定之期限，應對聯合國負責，並在聯合國管轄之下行動。該委員會必要時由聯合國人員協助，應負起如下之責任：（一）利用其斡旋之地位，向變方或向聯合國提出適當之建議，並採取適當之步驟，務使巴勒斯坦之局勢，繼續保證和平之調整；（二）採取該委員會所認為適當之措施，以培植阿拉伯人與猶太人間之友善關係；（三）監督遵守聯合國所決定之疆界，公路，鐵路，自由港，自由航空站，少數民族權利及其協議；（四）巴勒斯坦境內如有任何發展，凡足以改變聯合國在解決巴勒斯坦問題中所批准之任何協議者，或足以威脅該區之和平者，須迅速向聯合國提出報吿。</p>

<p>蕪湖米市　興衰記  本報特派員　朱民威　　（一）蕪湖米市沿革　蕪米市光緒八年設，迄今大十七年。原來江南米市在鎭江七浩口，無錫，以及浙江硤石鎭，李鴻章為了鄉誼，實唯將鎭江米市移於蕪湖，可說是政治上的一個人物為了他家鄉人有買賣做，　榮家鄉的一個港口，運用政治力量的結果。實際上，蕪湖這地方在經濟集中及交通中心兩點來說，也够成為糧食交易的市塲，但如沒有這位皖籍權威人物這麼奏呈，或許不那麼容易就分去了江蘇省會的米市。（附記：在設米市前後，李鴻章，及其家族，以實或被贈送的方式，取得了蕪湖區萬畝市區三分之一的市地所有權，這些市地約三千多畝，現統歸李族後人分有執管。）　　（二）歷年米市交易額　皖省糧食產區向分皖南區，江北區（又名巢湖區），淮河區。淮河區的糧食，以蚌埠為交易及出口集散地。江北區及皖南區以米店為主，其他糧食次之，此兩區糧食均以蕪湖為交易出口集中地，自遜淸設市以來，每年出口自秈稻秋收時的九月起，有四個月旺月，四個月淡月，至次年五月卽入靑黃不接期，米市暫停而雜糧又趨活躍，自五月至十月，雜糧中之菜籽，苞谷，黃豆等又買賣不絕，故蕪湖糧食市塲可謂終年活潑。米交易在旺月的秋收貨湧期，每日可有十萬包，（每包二百市經，包卽裝米的麻包）成交，每月由帆船及輪船運出者，約在三十萬包最多單是米一項每年曾達二百萬包，少亦在一百萬包以上，平均每年輸出米在一百五于萬包以上，雜糧數則在五十萬包左右，輸出地點最初為華南的廣州，汕頭等處，後來北洋各口岸需米亦來採買，天津，靑島，烟台等地亦成為出口對象，故在蕪經營米業者，先是廣東籍多，此後天津魯省等地人漸多，目下蕪地米業五帮中之採運業，卽為南北洋粵魯冀等地人為多。　　（三）現況　由於米及糧食交易加工等項之需要，蕪湖糧食業向分五帮，各營生理，五帮為：　　（一）礱坊業　　（二）碾米廠堆棧業　　（三）雜糧行業　　（四）米行業　　（五）採運業　　其中礱坊業及碾米廠堆棧業，係屬食米加工的工廠性營業。礱坊以舊式木礱碾米，為已落伍之米加工工塲，碾米廠則以柴油或電力發動碾米機碾米，兩者目下均各約二十餘家。由於南北洋路途遙遠，運力浩大，致採買者皆係買米而非稻，故使得蕪湖得能有此四十餘家礱坊碾米廠之存在。此兩業除作食米加工外，兼營堆棧，採買食米雜糧之買方，由於交輪運出前赴遠途，等運需時，成交後需將米糧妥存備運，故加工之礱坊碾米廠均附設有通氣高宏之堆棧，供作存米待運之場所，故此又產生「綫租」一項費用。　　至雜糧行業及米行業，皆屬賣方代表或經紀人，兩業以不需何項資本設備，僅一牌號，雇用熟手數人，卽可開業，故營此者甚多。雜糧業約三百餘家，米行業（又稱江廣行業，舊日所謂自三江買米售於兩廣之謂）約一百二十餘家，此兩業代表各外縣鄉鎭之小米商甚或出售產品之農民賣貨，收取佣金，完全中間商件質　　最後，採運業則屬代表天津，靑島，廣州，汕頭等地買方之經記人，亦如米行業及雜糧行業，為一中間性商人。但由於過去數十年從事斯業，積資甚富者甚多，如此業理事長李念慈，本身資財約在數十萬石米左右，蓋彼從事此業數十年，採運業代表外埠買方，必有信用與資財，始可經營，否則卽設牌號亦無外埠託為代購，故此業家歡不多，僅七十餘家。抗戰勝利後，華南購入這運，緬甸，越南之米較便，需於長江流域者較少，華北則以交通較近華中，需米皆由皖省供應者多，故三年來蕪地採運業以魯津帮營業較旺，而聲勢喧赫之廣汕帮則較差。　　此五業分佈地區，由於依靠水運糧食，廠店皆集中於畏江及靑弋江畔，礱坊碾米廠堆棧兩業夾靑弋江而設立，米行及採運業的糧號則設於長江濱之華盛街，雜糧行則分佈於蕪舊城區四門內外街及靑弋江畔。　　米在蕪湖市塲進出所加之費用　茲就米一石在蕪湖糧食市塲通過所加於其上的費用詳列於後：　　（一）行佣（米行所得）三角四分　　（二）號佣（採運業的糧號所得）八角三分　　（三）打包費（工人所得）七分　　（四）上下力（工人所得）二角五分　　（五）圓籌（堆棧所得）二分　　（六）自衛特捐（皖省政府所　）米六升，值價計約為九角六分　　（七）米業聯誼會米捐（五帮米聯會所得）一分　　（八）國稅千分之十二（國稅局　）千分之十二以十六元一石價計一角九分二厘　　（九）營業稅（縣税捐處得）三角　　（十）上下力陋規（工人及碼頭英雄所得）數目無定　　總計　二元九角七分二　　　目下蕪地糙米限價為十六元一石，各項必需加上之苛雜加上後，卽為十八元九角七分二厘，其中商人，工人，地方政府，各自攻繫對方所得太多或不應得，而利之所在，各不减　，致形成蕪地米價之高昂狀態，而為南北洋及他區買方所不敢問津。　　（附註：加工費及棧租不屬於每石出口米價內，故不計入。）　　（五）後果　代表買方之糧號，已有轉設於南京，鎭江，無錫者，米行業有改設蕪湖對江和　裕溪口鎭，及皖蘇邊境鄂溪高　交算之東　鐵者，蕪地本年秋收已多日，江北產區米糧旣不到蕪出售，皖南亦由東　或當　縣出口而不轉蕪，採購者亦少來蕪而先向無錫訂貨，故後果已馬顯明矣。南通城東大火「流亡村」盡燬　　〔本報南通廿三日電〕城東之南園今下午六時大火，燬民房百餘間，迄八時卅分火猶未止，該地為鄉區流亡難民麕集之所，新蓋瓦房草屋僅數月，有「流亡村」之稱，今全燬矣，起火原因為晚炊不愼所致。新安徽的開始  本報記者　寶白萍　　—與夏威主席一席談—　　〔本報合肥廿一日訊〕當報紙上登出夏威主皖消息的時候，在安徽人看來，是一件大事。抗戰，勝利，復員，戡亂，這許多過程中，有九年的悠長歲月，安徽政局一直沒有變動，而今天變了，正值加緊剿匪實行總體戰的時期。　　十四日下午，滿街紅綠標語，各機關首長齊集東門外迎候一位新人物，夏主席來了，和記者見面，第一句話便是此來決為安徽三千萬人民忠實服務，建設一個新安徽，改日再作長談。十六日他在就職典禮中提出兩句口號說：「實行總體戰，建設新安徽」！為達成這一目標，又提出「求安求均求富求敎」四大要求，和「尚廉尚能尚新尚實」四大作風，這就是他的治皖方針了，他說馬上擬訂施政綱領和實施計劃，頒佈實行，而要求的則是必須三千萬同胞通力合作，全力支持。　　一個機會，夏主席與記者有一段長的談話。　　三十年的戎馬生涯，身經百戰，把他鍜鍊成一個健壯沉毅的軍人，五十五歲的年紀，並沒有在他豐潤臉龐上刻劃下光陰暗催人老的記號，一口已不是純粹廣西容縣話，他侃侃而談着安徽美麗的遠景。　　首先以堅定的語氣銳：「安徽地居要衝，人多物博，歷代人才輩出，均有光榮史頁。當八年抗戰三年匪亂之後，瘀痍滿目，元氣待蘇，必在今天戡亂行憲時期，加緊建省工作」！　　記者詢以今天如何求安？把話題引到「四求」上去。他痛心的說：「自從江淮有了匪患，眼見人民顚沛流離，厥狀太慘，匪患不除，政治經濟一切受到影響。而還有相同於匪息的，就是政風不良，有些貪官污吏，土豪劣紳，狼狽為奸，危害地方，剝削人民，尤堪痛恨。今後除加强剿匪外，對當前貪官污吏土豪劣紳，必須同時開刀，如此人民才得安定」。　　「安定後就要求均了，要均勻，要均平。以在合肥而論，就有特殊人物以不出糧不出說為光榮，殊不知他已違了法，這是絕對不允許的。今後不但要求剿匪的負祖要平均公允，就是社會建設的利益也要求享受平均，最低限度要做到幼者公敎，老者公養，病者公醫（按卽是他的三公制度），這才是眞正的均。英國二次大戰後工黨執政，推行社會主義，管制經濟，得使生產日增，物價穩定，卽因管制公這，分配合理，故貧富不均現象逐漸消除。同時必須求富，這種富，不是個人發財，要富源開發，生產增加，進而提高一般人民生活水準，做到人人有工作，人人有飯吃，人人有屋住，人人有衣穿，人人有車坐，人人有書讀，人人有醫藥，人人有娛樂（按卽是他的八有政策），這樣才可實現眞正的民生主義。現在實行總體戰，正是以民生主義打擊共產主義的時候，我們根據「平均地權節制資本」的原則，如果推行盡利，那共產主義就可不打自倒了。進一步求得政府與人民均成富有，更希望做到土地公耕，商業公營，銀行公有（按卽是他的三公政策），實鐘民生主鸛的纏濟共管制度，建立新生活的體　。人良在安定均勻富足的情况下過生活，應該求敎了，過去敎育不普及，　寫子弟沒有享受敎育濺會，社會上才有　愚病私等現象，增進　人散事智能，同時使敎育與生產合一，發揮「雙手萬能」的創造精神，所以必須推行識字運動，對優秀靑年予以生產技術的訓練，使成為人才。」他說到這里加了一個結語，「也許有人以為我的「四求」理想過高，不易實現，其實只要我有信念，有決心，假以時日，逐步實施，相信總有成功的一天」。　　這位談鋒頗健的夏主席，繼續說下去：「為要達成「四求」主張，必須有四大作風才可收效，第一要廉潔，厲行禁絕貪污。第二要選賢任能，我對人事問題的態度，只問是否人才，是否努力，不問派系，不分畛域，省政府全班人馬一個未動，連秘書長也待政院去決定，如果大家各盡其才，我沒有理由調動的。第三求革新，有新認識，新精神，新方法，來建設新安徽。第四尚實際，我自問並無特長，但待人以誠，對事務實，不虛偽，方必由衷，不誇張，言出必行，今後仍當力求貫澈這種作風。」　　最後他慨歏歷史上宋代王安石變法，因為遭遇了舊勢力的反對和幹部的缺乏，終致失敗，他表示努力苦幹的決心，和選拔眞才的重要。　　二十日他召集省屬各機關全體職員訓話，末了出了兩個題目：一·如何澄淸吏治與整理財政，二·試舉所知廉能之士以對，限每位職員在月底繳卷，這是他的「四尚」作風的開始，每個安徽人在等待新的遠景及早來到眼前！「大淸復興王」　送監執行徒刑　　〔本報蘭州廿三日電〕半月前蘭州特刑庭宣判之「大淸復與王馬雲麟」陰陽暴動案，該犯等迄未聲請覆判，刻送監執行。淮南鐵路合蚌間日開三等車一次　　〔本報合肥廿三日電〕淮南路自廿四日起，合（肥）蚌（埠）間每日營開三等客車一次，上午八時由合開車，輕水家湖換車抵蚌，由蚌來合亦在水家湖換車，下午四時半到合，合蚌間客票一圓六與五，合水間一圓一角。無錫猪瘟猖獗農部派員防治　　〔本報無錫廿二日訊〕南鄉南方東等處，農家所畜之猪，發生瘟病，勢甚猖獗，死亡相繼，縣農會電報省方，轉報農林部設法防治，農部得報後，昨派東南獸疫防治處技佐曾華高來錫，與縣農菜推廣所指導員葛之民下鄉注射治療，携帶疫苗甚多。蘭谿新兵隊中捕獲十餘匪諜　　圖刦槍械幸被識破　　〔本報蘭谿廿日訊〕新省保安第七國第四連駐蘭接收新兵，尚未滿額，發覺已有十六名蘭北股匪匪諜潛混入隊，預定中秋節夜繳刦該連槍械出城，幸早識破陰謀，預先準備，常於是夜予以逮捕，經連長審訊確實，正呈請上峯核辦。海寗七里廟塘全部搶修完成　　〔本報海寗廿二日訊〕本縣七里廟一帶海塘，自遭怒潮冲毀後，該區工程處，奉命在大潮汛前搶修完竣，並請縣府派員征工，經廿日來之搶修，每日動負民工達一千數百人，已於昨日全部搶修竣事，所需工米，塘工局現正籌撥中。皖浙邊境要道婺華公路興修　　〔本報婺源十七日訊〕本邑至浙境華埠之婺華公路協修合約，經縣府胡飛鵬，王五漢赴杭簽訂，各項原則已與浙公路局確定，修費由婺貸款八十億，交浙方負責辦理，工程期間，為六十晴天，下月十日前便道通車，年底全部完工，正式通車，中秋節後開始興築。吳縣屬胥口鎭發現石油礦苗　　〔本報蘇州廿三日電〕縣屬　口鎭沿太湖一帶荒山，頃發現石沖鐵苗；資委會中國石油公司已派技師張春榮來蘇，在木凟設立辦事處，日往研究探測中。浙省利用美援　開發砩石礦　　〔本報杭州廿三日電〕浙省府將利用美援，大量開發　石織，以砩換取交通器材，在礦區與沿海重要地區與築輕便鐵道。袖珍新聞　　崑山　　〔本報訊〕縣府近查悉境內有所謂二十四弟兄之組織，專事販雙壯丁，從中圖利，破壞政府法令，特於廿一日晚將為首者駱文斌，陳祝三等九名逮捕，經沈縣長親目漏夜鞠訊，諭令暫押候辦。　　奉賢　　〔本報訊〕縣財政現臨困境，縣府因九月份縣費亟待發放，特於廿二日午由縣府召開標售積穀會議，將全部積穀三千四百担公開招標，結果由亭林永愗行，南橋華懋行各以最高標價穀每担金圓五元二角二分半分別得標。　　閔行　　〔本報訊〕滬閔長途汽車綫交通聯營處，隨票帶征上海縣事業補助費，係由縣參議會議決辦理。茲悉：縣府決自九月份起停止徵收，以恤商艱。　　吳興　　〔本報訊〕菱湖鎭建設協會，依照原定計劃積極進行，衛生院新址現正規工興築，建設靈山風景區亦分頭籌劃中，將築亭台樓閣，並小公園

<p>自由談「隱惡」非即「揚善」  靖文　　世界基督徒領袖總會遠東理事會主席荊磐石博士近對勤儉建國運動發表意見，認為推進此項運動，應從「標榜好人」「揭發壞人」兩點做起，藉以糾正社會風氣，我國人對於個人與個人之間的道德關係，向視「隱惡揚善」為一種美德。揚善當即是標榜好人之謂，當此舉世提倡重整社會道德之日，好人自然應予祟揚，但將「隱惡」與「揚善」視為一體，則往往會發生是非混淆的流弊。　　揭人隱私在某種意義上說當然是不道德的，因為世上畢竟沒有絕無缺點的「聖人」，祗要這稱缺點對於整個社會並無惡影響，就不應加以揭發。「隱惡揚善」在這裏才確是一種美德。尤其是發於自私動機的攻訐行為，更與揭發壞人的主旨無關，且反易敗壞社會風紀。　　然而隱惡與隱私却是兩件事。有隱私的人並非就是壞人，而壞人倒也不一定有他私人的隱私。例如有許多非先天性或職業性的犯罪份子，在其個人小圈子的生活中不僅不是壞人，有時還是好人。像最近被社會上目為「虎」字輩的人物以及大小貪官污吏，在他們個人的生活天地中，恐怕絕少够得上「壞人」之稱。　　我相信天生的惡人究竟是很少的，那怕是怙惡不悛的累犯，仔細分析起來，亦非絕無使之感化悔改的方法。其實人的善惡之分，個人的因素並不重要。一個十惡不赦的盜匪，其罪惡的影響究竟是有限的。殺人越貨雖然可怕，受害者畢竟尚有限度。對於這種有形的罪惡，即不待揭發，亦終有暴露之日。　　對於眞正善惡是非的判斷，必須從聱個的社會利益着眼；孰為好人，孰為惡人，如果脫難了社會利害的觀點，就很難分別淸楚。譬如像貪官，奸商，若不從社會觀點判斷，則他們在家庭中也許是慈父，對他們的直接下屬也許是好長官，可是他們的貪污與實要，則為危害整個社會的行為，是造成「一路哭」的原因。如果對於這種人亦一槪用一隱惡揚善」的道德觀點加以曲容，則勢必造成是非不明的局面，好人固無從「標榜」，而壞人倒反而得其所哉了。　　最近報紙上時有檢舉貪官奸商的新聞，且多數出於小市民的熱心自動，這應說是一種表現公民道德的好現象。然而也有一部份人認為此種舉動是「多事」，是「招冤家」，以為一個人卽使不能代人「隱惡揚善一，至少亦應「別管他家瓦上霜」。此輩人大多數是屬於熟知世故一流的所謂「明哲保身」者。　　在亂世時代，「明哲保身」的處世哲學，對個人自亦有其好處，但對於社會則未必，因為假使人人如此，不僅好惡是非難明，且對社會亦有失公民的責任。四方人每認為我國人民忍受壓迫與不平待遇的程度至為可驚。這一方面當然是因為公民敎育尚未澈底普及，然而明哲保身的處世哲學，實亦為一大阻力。　　也許有人認為揭發壞人的工作現在已經够了，各報的太埠新聞版豈非天天刊載着類似揭發壞人的消息嗎？重整社會道德，此後應着重於崇揚好人。這固然是對的，但我們必須知道揭發壞人的動機也就是要襯托好人，鼓勵好人，而非造成人人自危的攻許行動。人性的根底是善的，其所以敢於干犯法紀，泰半由於偶然的錯誤，而另一半則不能不說是因為一般人尚不善運用道德的制栽力量，致使犯者不能自覺其行為之錯誤。所以揭發壞人與崇揚好人，雖是一正一反，但對於重整社會這德，却是殊途同歸，我們正無需為之感覺不安。如果一味「隱惡」，則反有失去「揚善」眞意之虞了。賀新郞  陳蒙庵　　〔夜起有作日者與味逸論古謠　因及飯牛之歌乃節其語以起興他日味逸見之以為工於發端而有變徵之音〕　　長夜何時旦？迸繁霜隱憂耿耿，忍寒能慣；起視雲端　樣月，的嶸明星有爛，又戌鼓孤城凄怨。試把吳鈎勤携拭，漸荒鷄啼徹殘更轉。莫漫作，溝中斷。　中年絲竹難消遣。只不堪，椒蘭無實，從流先變。一曲商聲歌白石，要惜髪毛未換，早知道蓬萊淸淺。回首短繁牆角素，竚飛鴻天外音書遠。風勢定，露華泫。臨江仙　　西北高樓迷望眼，數行柳色毿毿。相思情味舊會　，應憐剛下九，又是說初三。　靑鳥殷勤頻探問，芳箋題破雲藍；傷心千里在江南。肯敎花外路，重駐月邊騐？主會服務中央銀行發行局　釋舊法幣兌換辦法　　准卅七年九月十七日大函，並附市民余劍平君函詢各商店撥販及行莊對於五千一萬等法幣拒收，請指示函一件。查自金圓券發行後，對於法幣不論大小面額，除本局在櫃面無限制兌換外，並由本局委託三行兩局一庫及各省市行一律收兌在案。且按金圓券發行辦法第五條末段規定，在兌換期內，均暫准照折合率流通行使。是則銀行錢莊不應拒收明甚。除分函本市銀行錢莊兩商業同業公會轉飭注意外，相應函復，卽希查照為荷。此致申報館社會服務部　中央銀行發行局服務簡報　　徽屋　讚者某君，有高尚職業，未婚，擬微單人寢室一問，早出晚歸，願以服務作交換條件，如有同意者，請函郵政總局劉克仁君洽。　　徵書　六合續者達君擬徵求孫了紅著偵探小說「俠盜魯平奇案」，割愛者請函六合北門外大街口七五號達雲鶴君洽。　　徹　　續者姜君擬徵求中華民國新圖一册，如願割愛者請函順昌路四十四號姜建國君洽。　　讓書　常州讀者金君擬將所廠「茶話」月刋廿四册出讓（第二期至廿五期），有意購藏者請函常州大馬元巷二八號金樸安君洽。　　招尋失物　敝人於九月十九日夜駕駛機器脚踏車行經南京東路不愼失落車身後座之黃布皮整子一隻。拾得者，諸送至永嘉路二九〇號或電話七四八五六，當致薄酬。養有成啓。吳缶廬遺事  陳左高　　安吉吳缶盧先生，夙以詩書畫篆刻名世，為人詼諧。予得自聽聞，多世傳軼事所闕，爰摭述二三，倘亦補遺云爾。先生諱俊卿，字倉石，一字昌碩，晚以字行，號缶廬，別號苦鐵，又署大　，小名香阿嬌。世居縣西部吳邨，當粵寇起難，舉邨受屠，祖母嚴，母萬，聘妻楊，及弟妹等盡與焉。先生奉父流轉，幸脫於死，亂平，成諸生，中歲偃蹇苦貧，乃與左高先四伯父漁門公，同官江蘇，盟結金蘭，酒後茶餘，輒為振筆作書，無不可觀，上恒鈐印，文曰：一月安東令。　　迨辛亥後，棲遲海上，藝名益噪。畫家况又韓兄，卽屬高第弟子，過從綦密，稱扶桑人十，最加折服，求者踵接。一日，其人有倩繪朝天葡萄，堅持弗去。先生　然對曰：一本國無此佳產。予塗就，君付裝池，倒懸辟間，不亦宜乎？」旣而，繪桃大如西瓜，葉亦肥碩逾常，或加詰責，又答曰：「幅內山水，固眞囿於尺素耶？山小桃大，丹靑中理無二致，奚據得云我畫之偭理乎？」於是求者不能難，　然而去。厥後先生謝世，六三花園一度為展遺作，會列盆二，係劉聚卿舊物，聚卿嘗置葡萄其上，缶盧取而啖畢，乘興照寫數串，工細絕倫，劉子公魯終始寶之。　　先生晚苦重聽，納妾而遁，晏如也。曰：一吾情深，他一往。一時閉門却掃，罕所瞻接，僅與遺流况蕙風朱彊村馮君木輩相往還，口不涉時政，感慨一抒於詩。乙丑多，經步林屋之介，偕況朱兩丈，三人共在蕙風簃，錄潘雪艷為義女，卽席蕙翁塡詞，彊老撰聯，先生年逾八十，豪興猶昔，賦七古一首，載當初林屋主編之大報。越三祀，遽歿海上寓廬，馮丈為撰墓誌銘，春秋正八十有四，民國十六年冬也。　　先是家兄巨來，常趨請益，見其人殊矮，貌若老尼，髮漆黑，梳道士髻，鬚僅十數根而已。平日持躬謙和，接後進，亦虛懷若谷，無　否語，偶或二人晤對，始稍摘紕指繆。嘗自道甘苦，深惜世人專規撫其作品曰：「人唯效予步趨，第莫審從入之難，為何如耶？」又謂：「箓刻如業花旦，僉恃年富目明，庶一印旣成，神完氣固，若至歲邁，便力不從心，予六十後，卽鮮奏刀矣。一由是見先生篆划，絕不茍作，晚年流傳諸印，微涉鈍拙，想非代庖，卽屬　鼎。其詩宗錢霽石，書擅石鼓文，畫法李復堂，治印初仿吳讓之，後參鐵印曁陶器，筆勢渾厚，大氣磅礴，書畫印三端，罔不成家，而予於渠畫，尤癖嗜痂，良由趣性使然。人造石  蒼雨　　蘇聯已發明了一種新的人造石。它的外表像大理石，但却像花崗石一樣硬，而且不怕風，雨，箱，熱的剝蝕。這種新的人造石，正在用來建築莫斯科的一蘇維埃宮」。「蘇維埃宮」是戰前開始建築的，是一極碩大無比的魔天樓，樓頂飾以列寗大彫像一座，全部高度比世界最高的紐約帝國大廈還要稍微高一點，建築完成時，將有寢室六千間，政府機關辦公室四萬間，和一個容納一萬一千人的大禮堂。「冷面音樂家」約夏·海費茲  友亭　　在「樂府千秋」影片中，有一位毫無表情的「冷面音樂家」，當他奏得聽衆們無不黯然神往的時候，唯一沒有受感動的却是演奏者自己。　　這位演奏者便是約夏·海費茲（Jascha　Heifetz）卓越的小提琴聖手。　　他的感情是內在的，喜怒哀樂不形於色，似有近乎東方人的性格。其實，他是道地的俄羅斯人——冷靜，沉着，堅毅。一九〇一年，他生長在俄國的維爾那Vilna（後屬彼蘭），一九二五年才歸化為美國公民。　　多少年前，我看過一張「淸平樂」影片，海費茲正是主角。同樣的，神技動人，表情毫無；那時幼稚的我，尚以為此人畢竟是音樂家，不善演戲；殊不知他有一套鎭定的工夫（這工夫也許正如聲樂敎授們常常吿誠學生的：「不要緊張」）。海費茲在七歲時，舉行獨奏會於俄國某處，一開頭，鋼琴的伴奏便接錯了，但海費茲不慌不忙地奏下去，結果讓伴奏跟上了。　　音樂家，當然是熟情的，但不一定形於外表；表面上的沉靜，正加强了內心的動力，藝術家們的默默無言，面孔畢板，其實說明他集中全力於實際的行動。　　美國人無不讚歎海費茲的稀有的天才：三歲學琴，五歲便露面公共集會中表演，八歲畢業於維爾那的音樂學校，後媲美而無愧：海費茲成名以後，練習的時間，少得奇怪，在每年兩個月的假期中，他完拋開了小提琴。但據他的經理人說，却沒有機會聽到他拉錯一個音符。　　海費茲，我更欽佩他的冷靜，沉着，因為這是無比的力量。析產  聽之　　南菲德蘭斯伐爾地方有一農人，死時留下了一大片田地給地的甲乙兩個兒子。　　兩個兒子就着手把這些田地平分為二，準備各取其一。可是一再嘗試的結果，却還是無法分得平均。　　他們就去見南非的總統克魯格，請他設法解決。　　克魯格就問：「如果我想出了一個公允的辦法，你們二人是否一定肯聽我的話呢？』　　弟兄二人一致表示絕對遵命。　　克魯格就說：「好，那未甲光負責把這些田分成兩半；分好之後，却要襄乙先挑選自己的一份。」　　兄弟二人欣然從命，析產的事情順利解決，而且兄弟間的感情也更融洽了。恬澹  何苦　　在某一份日刊上，有一位作者說，人到中年，歡喜秋天，由於春天絢麗的色彩，與中年人恬澹的個性不合云云。此言頗能獲得中年人的共鳴，我嘗推累：何以中年人的個性，會變得恬澹如一泓秋水的？其原因還以人為的因素比諸自然的因素來得多。譬如說，一到中年，自己總有二三個孩子了，雖然有時和孩子玩要，不免會爬在地上，讓自己的背心給他當作馬背騎，好像自己是一個「大孩子」模樣；究竟不能整日嘻皮笑臉，在應該敎導的時候，總要正經一下。　　又如在上講堂的時候，辦公的時候，開會時候，赴宴會的時候，種種環境逼使你濱向一個不近於自然，流乎做作的狀態之下，不能隨隨便便，需要裝模作樣：像一個敎師，職員，演說家，或賓客的樣子。在這種所謂禮節的約東之下，人們逐漸由自然的本性變成了人為的做作，由活潑而趨於呆板，在上流社會中，　錫此種違反自然的性格以雅名曰文雅和恬澹。　　一言以蔽之，充沛與活躍的生命力隨着年齡的增加逐漸消失了。常聽到有平章人物的時候，總是說某某少年時代倔强多棱角，過幾年來的磨鍊，漸漸變得圓通了云云。我想金縷曲的作者便是澈悟到少年人接近目然的本性之可貴，才發為詩詞，「勸君莫惜金樓衣，勸君惜取少年時」的。　　我家三歲的阿欣，當她拿着一面中秋節插在香斗上的紙旗時，便盡情地揮動，以至於桿折紙裂，自名大人的父母，便要駡孩子不懂珍惜玩具，祗知破壞。其實非充沛與活躍的生命力表現之一例乎？又如當我回家把皮鞋換上拖鞋以後，阿欣便把一雙小脚踏進了我的大皮鞋，梯梯吐吐地學大人跑路了。結果是跌了一交，號哭一塲結束。這一份學跑路的時候便想穿大皮鞋的勇氣，在恬澹的中年人中間，便很難找到，所謂知其不可為而為之的精神，上自庸官懦吏，下逮編氓小民，已經全盤隨着少年時代消逝了。　　到老還閃煙着充沛與活躍的生命力的光芒者，是人間的瓖寶。中國人我想以齊白石為例，西洋人以蕭伯納為例。當此凉秋天氣，二老決不會「却道天凉好筒秋」的。</p>

<p>[Special Dispatch from Nanjing on the 23rd] Director of the Executive Yuan Information Bureau Dong Xian Guang answered inquiries at a press conference on the 23rd as follows:</p>
<p>Question: It is mentioned in the secret record of Hopkins published in the Collier's magazine on August 28 that President Roosevelt had already discussed the handling of the Dalian issue with Chairman Chiang Kai-shek at the Cairo Conference long before the Yalta Conference was held.

Appropriate measures should be formulated to provide effective relief for all laid-off unemployed personnel. (2) All administrative agencies and public enterprises should, except for technical personnel who should be given preferential treatment, adjust their salaries in accordance with the principle of equal pay for equal work and equal pay for the same location, unify standards, and must not set their own salaries, arbitrarily increase the number of salaries issued, create names, and misappropriate funds. All points must be returned to the public and enrich the national treasury. (3) Change the treatment of civil servants in accordance with the current price situation and daily life needs to maintain their basic life and encourage honest governance. (4) Strictly implement the standards for the appointment of civil servants, earnestly assess rewards and punishments, effectively improve the quality of civil servants, and fully exert work efficiency.</p>
<h3>An Excellent Source for Establishing an Aluminum Industry: Iron Bauxite Deposits Discovered in Fujian, US Bureau of Mines Attaches Great Importance and Has Prepared a Report</h3>
<p>[Report] Washington, 23rd Broadcast: According to a report by the U.S. Bureau of Mines, iron bauxite deposits recently discovered in Fujian Province in southeastern coastal China will provide China with an excellent source of raw materials needed to establish an aluminum industry. The Bureau made the above report based on a report prepared by Klingham, an economic analyst at the U.S. Consulate in Shanghai, after studying China's light metal industry. According to a report by the Resources Committee Bureau of Mines, the ore beds in Fujian Province contain 500,000 tons of aluminum-containing minerals. The US Bureau of Mines stated that China used to import bauxite from the Dutch East Indies and other places before the war to meet domestic needs, spending a lot of foreign exchange. In order to save this foreign exchange, it will inevitably find ways to supply bauxite domestically in order to achieve self-sufficiency. Zhejiang, Anhui, Liaoning, Hebei, Shandong, Yunnan, and other provinces in China all produce bauxite, but they have not yet been fully developed, and their reserves have not been estimated. At present, China's demand for aluminum is small, about 5,000 to 10,000 tons per year, but after all the factories destroyed during the war and operated by the Japanese have been restored, the demand for aluminum will greatly increase.</p>

<h3>Full Text of President Chiang’s Address at the Academia Sinica Convocation: Five Hopes for Academic Advancement</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 23rd] President Chiang addressed the Academia Sinica convocation today. The full text is as follows:</p>
<p>Today is the first gathering of the Academicians of Academia Sinica. This is fortunate for the Chinese academic community and for the nation.</p>
<p>Academia Sinica has been established for twenty years, but only this year has there been an election and assembly of Academicians. Its establishment was one of the important policies for national construction after the Northern Expedition when the national capital was set in Nanjing. The fact that the election of Academicians has only taken place after twenty years is genuinely due to the invasion by Japanese bandits. During the military period, it was not easy to attend to long-term plans for cultural and educational development. Also, the path of academic progress requires that each step wait for the maturity of the opportunity. If it is done before the opportunity is ripe, it is easy to create malpractices. Academia Sinica has been able to do this only after twenty years of experience, which is sufficient to demonstrate its gradual progress and its commitment to pragmatism. Examining the precedents of national academies in various countries, each selects Academicians or members as the main body, and then research work develops accordingly. Academia Sinica established research institutes twenty years ago and established a very comprehensive national council thirteen years ago. Today, the establishment of a national Academicians’ assembly seems to reverse the general order. This is precisely because at the beginning of Academia Sinica’s establishment, various Chinese academic fields were not as developed as they were ten years later, so the conditions for the regular election of Academicians were not in place. Although academic endeavors have been deeply affected by the Japanese bandits in the past ten years, some subjects are still on a steady path of progress. Therefore, today's ability to do this is precisely what is called "when water flows, a channel is formed." The founding of Academia Sinica began with this steady plan, which is truly the foresight of the former President Mr. Cai Yuanpei. The ability of Academia Sinica to attract talent and establish achievements is also due to Mr. Cai Yuanpei’s virtue and reputation.</p>
<p>The Academicians elected this year are truly outstanding talents of the nation. From now on, the nation will have its representative academy, cooperating and progressing with academies around the world. Given this good opportunity, I would like to express my hopes to you.</p>
<p>First, raise academic standards. Today, the number of universities in the country is far greater than before. This is indeed a need for national construction, but it is still a long way off for each to be able to fully perform the functions of education and achieve the task of academics. To seek academic advancement, it is necessary to first establish a model and create a reputation, and then, as the influence spreads, there will be widespread progress. Each of you has been recognized by the people of the country in your respective fields of study. In the future, you must further increase your discoveries and inventions in your specialized fields. Within ten years, it will not be difficult to catch up with the advanced scientific countries, as Sun Yat-sen said.</p>
<p>Second, disseminate academic achievements. I will not mention ancient Chinese matters. Although there were no modern academies in the Ming and Qing dynasties, the dissemination of their cultural relics was unmatched by any country in the world at that time. The Ming Dynasty had the compilation of the Yongle Encyclopedia, and the Qing Dynasty had the compilation of the Complete Collection of Books. The Ming Dynasty had the printing of books by the Jingchang, and the Qing Dynasty had the compilation of the Siku Quanshu. Today, the scope of academic research is far wider than before. Republican academics should strive to surpass the past, with grand compilations and masterpieces, both to enlighten the wisdom of the Chinese people and to promote the nation’s culture and education to the world.</p>
<p>Third, promote scientific cooperation. The progress of science is due to free development and rational planning. In the early stages of modern scientific development, the former was more important. Today, equipment and organization are necessary for work. Therefore, to seek substantial achievements, there must be rational planning. This is not the work of one person, nor is it the work of one school or one institution. It is necessary to concentrate efforts on one design, and then it can be expected to achieve success. To seek rational and effective planning, it is necessary to seek outstanding talents. To cooperate according to the plan, it is necessary to rely on the reputation of the academic community. This is indeed the responsibility of you all.</p>
<p>Fourth, communicate academically with academies of various countries. Now that China has this representative national academic body, cooperation with academies of various countries should be more convenient than in the past. All such cooperation, whether it is cooperation in undertakings or exchange of talents, can affect the domestic scientific community, thereby promoting academic progress, not only for the purpose of fostering good neighborly relations between countries.</p>
<p>Fifth, devote efforts to national construction. Modern national construction relies on academic progress in every aspect. Therefore, countries with backward academics are also backward countries. If a country seeks progress, academics must advance first. In today's society, everything related to clothing, food, housing, transportation, and childbirth and disease requires scientific knowledge to help improve it. In today's nation, whether it is agricultural promotion, industrial construction, or military installations, it also requires scientific knowledge to establish its foundation. There are countless construction projects in our country, all of which have a very distant future due to the backwardness of science. The needs of the era are even more pressing. Engaging in this is the business of the entire nation, but contributing your knowledge and leading the way is especially the responsibility of you all. Building a modern China is building a scientific China. This must be the sentiment that you share with me. I especially hope that you will all go to the cause of construction with one heart and cooperate to achieve it.</p>
<p>At this auspicious gathering, I have briefly discussed what I hope for, to wish this meeting success and to wish for the progress of Chinese academics. (Please refer to page 7 for news about the Academia Sinica Convocation)</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Facing the Crisis in Southeast Asia</h3>
<p>The Indonesian Communist Party launched a coup on the 19th, occupying Madiun City, the industrial center of East Java. The party leader, Muso, declared the establishment of the "Javanese Soviet Republic," appointing himself as the "President" of this red regime. From the Madiun radio station, he called on the Indonesian people to rise up and overthrow the Republican government led by President Sukarno. As a result, the Indonesian Republican government had no choice but to abandon the provisions of the new constitution, granting extraordinary dictatorial powers to President Sukarno in order to quell the violent rebellion of the Indonesian Communist Party. Therefore, the traces of blood from the Dutch-Indonesian War have not yet dried, and now it has reached the brink of civil war. This is not only a misfortune for the Indonesian people, but also a wake-up call for Southeast Asia. As the saying goes, "One falling leaf heralds the coming of autumn." The crisis in Southeast Asia cannot be ignored!</p>
<p>The crisis in Southeast Asia has been brewing for a long time. After the end of World War II, Southeast Asian countries, such as Indonesia, Burma, Vietnam, and Malaya, were all stirred by the world trend and longed for freedom and independence. The conflicts between the Dutch and Indonesians and the disputes between the French and Vietnamese all occurred in this context. However, for the past two or three years, they have failed to achieve thorough and reasonable solutions that could satisfy the wishes of the people of each country. In the face of disappointment, it is natural to easily take extreme paths. According to a United Press International dispatch from Singapore, British diplomat Coster said, "The rise of communism in Indonesia is entirely due to the deep disappointment of the Indonesian people with American policy." This statement can be described as a "bullseye," worthy of deep reflection by the great powers. In particular, the United Kingdom, France, and the Netherlands, which have direct interests in Southeast Asia, must change their current policies.</p>
<p>Looking at the actual situation in Southeast Asia, the riots of communist parties everywhere have become increasingly active since the establishment of the Southeast Asia branch of the Communist International Intelligence Bureau in Bangkok in May, due to central leadership. Now, it has reached a point where it is "out of control." Bangkok has become the main base for communist activities in Southeast Asia. Burma also has a tendency to turn left. Burmese Prime Minister Thakin Nu has openly declared that he "wishes to make the whole country Sovietized," which is truly shocking. As for India, the Communist Party has always possessed great potential among workers and peasants. In January of this year, it also encouraged railway workers in Calcutta to strike. Fortunately, Nehru's active suppression of communism was able to force the communist agitation underground. However, the situation in Malaya is more serious than anywhere else. The Communist Party is lurking in rubber plantations, agitating, assassinating, robbing, and arsoning everywhere, using every means possible, forcing British Commissioner for Malaya Sir Gurney to declare a state of emergency and arrest communist bandits on a large scale, causing the British Communist Party to say, "The colonial war has already begun in Malaya." Recently, the violent coup by the Indonesian Communist Party has shown an even stronger "rising tide."</p>
<p>The crisis in Southeast Asia has long been taken seriously by public opinion. For example, the Manchester Guardian in the United Kingdom commented on the Asian situation in June, arguing that "preventing the development of the Communist Party in Asia lies in providing economic assistance to Asian countries." American House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Eaton also said in early July, "Asia and the Far East are more dangerous than European countries; the real expansion of the Soviet Union will target Asian countries." Congressman Judd further pointed out that "the Communist Party has launched a decisive offensive in Asia." However, British and American officials have remained silent. It was not until the 15th of this month that Foreign Secretary Bevin declared in the House of Commons, "The Communist International has launched an offensive to drive Western forces out, and the development of the situation in Southeast Asia has recently begun... They not only want to make Burma and Malaya fall entirely within the scope of communist occupation, but also to cause such disturbances and unrest in every corner of the world." At the same time, Dutch Foreign Minister Stikker, seeing the deepening crisis in Southeast Asia, went to Washington to discuss countermeasures with Marshall. Although the content is unknown, it can be asserted that an agreement must have been reached between the United States and the Netherlands. The gradual emphasis of the great powers on the crisis in Southeast Asia is also becoming increasingly clear.</p>
<p>In short, on the one hand, the power of the Communist Party is gradually pressing westward towards Western Europe. The inability to resolve the Berlin crisis has already shown the tension in the European situation. On the other hand, it is also launching an offensive in Southeast Asia, creating unrest and unease throughout Asia, attempting to take advantage of the illusion that the United Kingdom and the United States are neglecting the crisis in Southeast Asia to achieve its mission without any effort. If so, the result will not only be that the economic interests of Western democratic countries in Southeast Asia will be deeply affected, but also that they will suffer major blows in politics and military strategy. Therefore, after the violent coup by the Indonesian Communist Party, we must awaken the attention of countries such as the United Kingdom, the United States, France, and the Netherlands. The crisis in Southeast Asia is deepening, and we must not neglect the importance of Southeast Asia because of the Berlin crisis. However, the way to save the crisis in Southeast Asia should be to reconsider their respective policies towards Southeast Asia. The past policies and practices of dealing with colonies cannot be applied to this era. The alarm bell in Indonesia has already rung, how can we deceive ourselves and repeat our mistakes? We hope that the political diplomats of the great powers can quickly make wise choices regarding the crisis in Southeast Asia!</p>
<h3>Success Comes from Diligence and Thrift, Failure from Extravagance: Ninety-Year-Old General Sa Zhenbing Supports the Campaign to Promote National Construction through Thrift and Encourages Compatriots to Abandon the Concept of Luxury</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Fuzhou, 23rd] General Sa Zhenbing, a highly respected and lifelong thrifty elder of the navy, who is now ninety years old, expressed his sincere support for President Chiang’s campaign to build the nation through diligence and thrift. When reporters visited him and inquired about his opinions, he said: "Success comes from diligence and thrift, failure from extravagance" has been true since ancient times. The people of our country have always been known for their diligence and thrift, but in recent times, social customs have deteriorated, and the general public has become accustomed to luxury, living in comfort and indulging in extravagance, causing legitimate income to be unable to sustain their extravagant lives. This has led to opportunistic and corrupt behavior, creating a bad social atmosphere. He believes that the President’s wise call is something that all people in the country should thoroughly follow today. Elder Sa said: I entered the Mawei Naval Academy at the age of eleven. At that time, my family was poor, with parents above me and a younger sister below me. At that time, my monthly allowance from the school was five dollars and fifty cents. Except for the forty cents I used for myself, the rest was sent home for household expenses. If we were not diligent and thrifty, our family's life would not have been able to be sustained. He compared today's national situation to a large family in difficulty. The nation, as children and younger brothers, must save every penny and work together to help. Although he is a highly respected figure in China's naval circles, with a reputation that has shaken the world, and has held high positions in the central government, he has no permanent property when he retires in his old age. His current residence is "Ren Shou Tang," donated by people in central Fujian, with three humble houses, plain clothes, and simple food. He spends his days wielding his pen, and the proceeds from his writing are used to help the poor, so the people of Fujian all call him "Living Bodhisattva." He encouraged his compatriots by saying: "I don't smoke, don't drink, don't eat meat, and don't gamble, and my spirit is not painful at all, and my body is quite healthy. I have lived to be ninety years old this year. If everyone can make up their minds to abandon the concept of luxury, be diligent, thrifty, and frugal, it will not only benefit oneself, but also benefit the country." A month ago, he was entrusted to provide disaster relief to the victims of the flood in Rong City. He personally went door-to-door to provide relief. In the streets of Rong City, the elderly man was often seen walking slowly, never taking a car, and standing for several hours in public commemorative gatherings, looking cheerful. At his age of ninety, he is still able to be diligent, thrifty, endure hardship, and be sweet, which is truly commendable and a model for us. In addition, people from all walks of life in Fujian Province, in response to the President’s campaign to build the nation through diligence, thrift, and frugality, have prepared to organize a provincial-level guidance committee. Counties and cities have established promotion committees. The Rural City Military Officers Association gathered to discuss and solicit effective ways to promote it.</p>
<h3>Rong Elderly Man Liu Yubo Explains the Meaning of "Diligence" and "Thrift"</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chengdu, 23rd] Liu Yubo, the only surviving member of Chengdu's "Five Elders," is 91 years old. He is known for his diligence and thrift in scholarship, and his poems, calligraphy, and paintings are well-known at the time. He lives a thrifty life and still has sharp ears and eyes and an excellent memory. When reporters visited him, he was resting on his bed. When he talked about President Chiang's thrift campaign, he gladly sat up and said to the reporter with a smile: "Good, good, you must be diligent to establish yourself, you must be thrifty to manage affairs, you must be diligent and thrifty to build the nation." He pointed to a small booklet he had written in front of the bed, "Advocating Merit and Simplicity," and told the reporter that this article was written in the early years of the Republic of China, and today he feels even more the necessity of promoting the thrift campaign. The elderly man's explanation of the words "diligence" and "thrift" said: "We should be diligent in improving our virtue and learning, fearing that we are not diligent enough. Dayu even cherished every inch of time, and was not burdened by food, clothing, music, or profit. Only diligence can make achievements. Thrift is a general principle. There is a clear instruction from ancient times: thrift makes the will concise, concise the will and peaceful the heart, peaceful the heart and clear the spirit. This can be used to study and manage affairs. Therefore, those who are diligent must be thrifty, and those who are thrifty can be diligent."</p>

<h3>Executive Yuan Formulates Measures for the Use of Special Disaster Relief Donations</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 23rd] The fundraising for the special disaster relief donations is about to end.

<h3>Ping Municipal Government Section Chief Turns Out to Be a Communist Spy: Dong Jianping Sentenced to Death After Trial</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 23rd] The case of Dong Jianping (Jianping), a section chief of the Peiping Municipal Government who caused a sensation in Peiping and Tientsin, was transferred to the Capital Higher Special Criminal Court by the National Defense Ministry's Bureau of Confidential Affairs.

In 1946, he contacted Zhou Zijian, the head of the Communist Party's Xi'an Office, and Zhao Zifang, the director of intelligence work in the Northwest and Northeast regions. While Dong was a section chief in the Peiping Municipal Government, Zhao Zifang, who had the identity of an officer of Hu Zongnan's Headquarters, came to Peiping to contact Dong and introduced him to Li Zhengxuan and Chen Rongsheng, Communist spies in Peiping. Dong was responsible for intelligence transmission and was assigned the work number 311.

Zhao Zifang was arrested by the Bureau of Confidential Affairs, leading to the exposure of the case.</p>
<h3>Still Needs Work to Stabilize the Economy in Peiping: Citizens Buy the Worst Goods at the Highest Price Limit; Merchants Do Everything to Prevent Surprise Inspections</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Peiping, 23rd] Economic controls in Peiping still need work. The deadline for exchanging gold, silver, and foreign currencies is less than a week away, and the amount received so far is considered small by many, reflecting the weak confidence of merchants and citizens in prices. Citizens are suffering from buying the worst goods at the highest price limit, but there have been no reports of complaints or accusations. Except for corn flour, other grains and flours are not easy to buy. The distribution of rationed flour is slow, and disputes over purchases occur several times a day. Since the so-called mislabeling of prices by the China Textile Corporation, it has been distributing cloth for several days in a row. The price of cloth has remained within the price limit, but on the 23rd, it also rose. Most markets are quiet and lack active trading. In the past two days, goods with price limits announced by the Municipal Government have quickly become scarce, and merchants are doing everything to prevent surprise inspections.</p>
<p>[Another Dispatch] The Peiping Municipal People's Foreign Exchange Assets Declaration and Registration Guidance Committee was established at 4:00 p.m. on the 23rd, consisting of one representative each from the Municipal Government, the Municipal Council, the Central Bank, and the Gold Control Bureau.

The authorities believe that the number of exchanges and deposits last time was too small, and the wait-and-see attitude still exists. In addition, after the stocks of five state-owned enterprises were put on sale in Peiping on the 21st, there were not many buyers. 294 shares were sold on the first day and 56 shares were sold on the second day. The authorities are strengthening publicity for this time.</p>

<p>[Our Guangzhou Dispatch, 23rd] The fire at the Wing On Warehouse in Hong Kong has not been extinguished as of the morning of the 23rd. A total of 16 buildings have been destroyed, 114 people have been injured, including 50 seriously injured, and the death toll remains at 18. The long duration of the fire is unprecedented in Hong Kong's history. Estimated losses reach more than HK$20 million. The warehouse contained a large amount of cloth, raw rubber, tung oil, printing paper, etc., all of which are flammable, making firefighting very difficult.

<h3>Marshall Formally Informs All Nations; Emphasizes That Human Rights Should Be Highly Respected; Hopes to Conclude Japanese and Austrian Peace Treaties Soon; General Debate of the United Nations General Assembly Commenced Yesterday</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 23rd] The general debate of the United Nations General Assembly commenced today. The Philippine representative, Romulo, delivered a speech in English, calling on major powers to make renewed efforts to find peaceful solutions to current differences, so that humanity has the opportunity to achieve more solid security guarantees within the United Nations framework, in order to create benefits for everyone in the world. He also stated that small countries can, through joint efforts and collective strength, act as a third force to uphold peace, assisting major powers in preventing war. In the past few weeks, Romulo has been the center of attention for people all over the world. Both today and during the United Nations General Assembly, Paris will be the center of attention. Romulo further emphasized that this General Assembly is convened at the most important time in world history, and this meeting will also determine the fate of war and peace in the world.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Paris, 23rd] Following Romulo, U.S. Secretary of State Marshall rose to speak, solemnly declaring that the United States is unwilling to compromise on fundamental principles and "will not sacrifice the rights and freedoms of other people as commodities for trade."</p>
<p>In his speech, Marshall echoed Romulo's war warning. He cited the United Nations Charter's guarantee to save future generations from the scourge of war, "But we not only have the need to rescue our descendants, we must also rescue ourselves today." Marshall did not mention the Berlin issue, but continued, "The United States is unwilling to add fuel to the fire in the current situation. The United States sincerely desires to reduce international tension." He appealed to all member states to find ways to improve the situation, and warned that countless people around the world are eagerly awaiting this important meeting, "We should not disappoint them." He attributed the world's difficulties to "the systematic and deliberate denial of fundamental human rights." Although he did not directly mention the Soviet Union, he stated, "It is entirely wrong that millions of men and women live in terror of secret police every day, facing the threat of arrest, imprisonment, and forced labor." Marshall further stated that the work of the United Nations has been quite effective in the past year, "But even though the majority of countries are willing to cooperate and rebuild peace and prosperity, the situation has deteriorated in the past year. The rulers of certain countries are creating deep divisions within their own countries and in the world. We must not allow this division to widen further." Marshall denied that peacemaking is only a matter for major powers, and stressed that it involves countless governments and countless people. "On issues that need to be resolved, both large and small countries must express their opinions and seek global consensus." The focus of Marshall's speech was on the need to respect individual freedoms and rights. He earnestly urged the General Assembly to pass the draft of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights with an "overwhelming majority." He warned that "A government that systematically violates the rights of its own people will not respect the rights of other countries and other people, and will inevitably use international intimidation and force to achieve its goals."</p>
<h3>Seeking to Achieve Peaceful Goals in Addressing Various Issues</h3>
<p>In addition to appealing for the passage of the Declaration of Human Rights, he stated that the United States hopes to achieve the following goals, which are also the goals of the General Assembly:</p>
<p>Palestine: To establish a Palestine free from war and the threat of war, with guarantees for the peaceful development of both Arabs and Jews, and to allow Transjordan and Israel to join the United Nations.</p>
<p>Korea: An independent and unified Korea, recognized by the United Nations, with free elections for Koreans to produce a constitution and government.</p>
<p>Greece: Greece should not be harmed by illegal external aggression.</p>
<p>Indonesia: There should be no more bloodshed in Indonesia, and both sides should resolve everything through negotiations.</p>
<p>India-Pakistan Dispute: Regarding Kashmir, India and Pakistan should continue mediation and compromise.</p>
<p>Atomic Energy: An international system for controlling atomic energy should be adopted as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Disarmament: Under reliable and appropriate guarantees, progressive and rapid disarmament should be implemented.</p>
<p>After Marshall finished speaking, the Soviet delegation sat silently, unwilling to applaud. Marshall also put forward three major points on the world's dangerous situation:</p>
<p>First, the United States will do its best to resolve the current situation in "appropriate institutions." Second, "If we want peace, we must resolve the problems caused by the last World War." Third, the world should strive to conclude German, Japanese, and Austrian peace treaties "early and fairly."</p>
<p>Marshall's language was moderate and devoid of emotional outbursts, in stark contrast to the first speaker from the Soviet bloc, Polish representative Modzelewski. Modzelewski heavily criticized the Berlin airlift, calling it an "absurd aerial bridge," and that transporting coal into Berlin by plane was an "economic fallacy." He also vehemently denounced the Marshall Plan as rebuilding West Germany into a satellite of the West, "in order to revive aggression," making Germany its "master's tool, a reactionary and reorientation outpost, and a springboard for conquering the world."</p>
<h3>Representatives of Venezuela and Egypt Speak</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] Paris, 23rd Broadcast: The United Nations General Assembly continued its meeting on the afternoon of the 23rd. The Venezuelan Foreign Minister spoke in favor of the continued existence of a "small General Assembly" and advocated that the Security Council's veto power should be restricted. The Egyptian Foreign Minister denounced Jewish immigration to the Holy Land as threatening peace in the Middle East and the world. At this point, Eivat announced that the General Assembly would be adjourned until tomorrow morning.</p>
<h3>Bernadotte's Proposals Not Fully Endorsed by the Jewish Side</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 22nd] A spokesman for the unofficial committee of Israel attending the United Nations General Assembly stated at a press conference today: The proposal in the Bernadotte report to recognize Israel's independence is satisfactory, but the Israeli government cannot fully accept the resolutions in the report. In particular, the Israeli government opposes the violation of the proposals of the previous United Nations Investigation Committee and the proposal to demarcate the Negev out of Israel's territory.</p>
<h3>General Assembly Agenda; Includes Seventy Items; General Committee Conducting Discussions</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Paris, 22nd] The provisional agenda, comprising seventy items, includes the most difficult issues facing the United Nations, such as Palestine, Korea, the Balkans, and the Security Council's veto power. The General Committee spent most of its time today discussing what should be included in the agenda and what should be removed, and will submit the agenda to the General Assembly for formal adoption. Soviet representative Vyshinsky condemned Western countries for attempting to create a "disunited" United Nations. However, the Soviet Union repeatedly tried to prevent the General Assembly from discussing issues such as Korea, Greece, the Security Council's veto power, and the admission of new member states, but was ultimately rejected by the General Committee by a majority vote. This year's agenda includes the original 45 items, 20 supplementary items, and 5 finally submitted items, including the Palestine issue, the Italian colonies issue, and the United Nations Security Guard issue. According to the Soviet Union's consistent practice, it may raise major issues during the debate in the General Assembly, as it may do this year.</p>
<h3>Nationwide Labor Strike for Two Hours in France</h3>
<p>Government Agrees to Workers' Wage Increase Demands</p>
<p>[Our Dispatch] London, 23rd Broadcast, Paris News: The French government decided on the 23rd to approve a 15% wage increase for French workers. This percentage increase is smaller than that demanded by both communist and non-communist unions.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 23rd] The two-hour symbolic strike in France will be held in cities across the country from 4 to 6 p.m. on the 24th. Public transportation throughout Paris will be completely suspended, and the city government and all public utilities will be shut down.</p>
<h3>Three Powers Make Final Attempt; New Note to Soviet Union; Demanding Resolution of Berlin Incident</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 22nd] The governments of Britain, the United States, and France today submitted a new note to Moscow regarding the Berlin issue. In the note, the three countries agreed to the French Foreign Minister's suggestion to postpone the German issue to the United Nations and continue negotiations by the four countries, with the issues for negotiation limited to the blockade of Berlin and seeking to unify the Berlin currency system under four-power joint management. However, Western officials are confident that if the Soviet response is unsatisfactory, the Berlin issue will be fully debated in the United Nations.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, London, 22nd] Bevin declared in the House of Commons today, "Britain believes that the Soviet Union's opening of the Berlin blockade is the main condition for resolving the Berlin issue. The Western three countries are not only in complete agreement on Berlin policy, but also have reached a consensus on what the three countries should do after negotiations fail. It is a big mistake to say that Britain wants war. We still hope that a unified German government can be established sooner or later." Referring to US-Soviet relations, Bevin said, "I believe that the East and West can coexist and prosper together. I am prepared to live together peacefully, and I ask the other party to also live peacefully in the 'areas they have acquired.'"</p>
<h3>Indonesian Government Troops Advance in Three Routes; Attack Communist Troops in Madiun City; United Nations Good Offices Committee is Conducting Reconciliation</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Batavia, 23rd] It was learned on the 23rd that the government of the Republic of Indonesia has begun an offensive against the communist rebels in East Java, and government troops have advanced to within twelve miles of Madiun City, the center of the coup. Antara, the official news agency of the Republic, reported that a full-scale offensive against the communist-held city began on the 21st, with government troops advancing towards Madiun City from three directions. Fighting is taking place around Madiun Airport, six miles from the city, and near Ngarai, eighteen miles northeast of the city.</p>
<p>The communist troops around Madiun City number about 3,000. They also launched an offensive near Nagertables, a railway intersection twenty-five miles east of the city, but government troops defeated and disarmed the socialist youth army, the elite force of the communist troops. The army has surrendered to the government. Radio Jogjakarta broadcast that government troops have advanced to within twelve miles of Madiun City. "The government military commanders are confident that the recovery of Madiun City will be achieved in the shortest possible time."</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Batavia, 22nd] Indonesia ordered a ban on gatherings of more than ten people on the 22nd. Radio Jogjakarta announced the ban, saying that this measure will be taken during the emergency period.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Washington, 22nd] Deputy Secretary of State Lovett told reporters on the 22nd that Dutch Foreign Minister Stikker's recent visit here was purely to exchange views with U.S. officials. Asked whether Stikker had requested assistance in the Indonesian affair and whether the State Department had made such a assistance proposal, Lovett replied that Stikker provided the State Department with a great deal of information. He did not elaborate further. Asked whether the United States would take steps to help the Netherlands or Indonesian nationalists suppress Indonesian communists, Lovett declined to comment, but pointed out that the United States is a member of the Good Offices Committee sent by the United Nations to the area, and the committee is trying to bring the opposing parties together. At the same time, those in charge pointed out that the US government considers the situation in Indonesia to be very serious. Some officials said that there is good reason to believe that the communist movement to seize power in Southeast Asia is partly aimed at undermining the European Recovery Program. They explained that some European countries rely on the benefits of investment in Southeast Asia, and these benefits have been lost due to the unrest launched by the communists.</p>
<h3>Soviet Union Admits Deep Cracks in Communist International; Urges Eastern European Countries to Unite; Report of Meeting in Southern Russia Needs to be Verified</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 22nd] The arrival of Czech President Gottwald in Crimea, and the fact that Stalin is also vacationing there, have led diplomats here to believe that Moscow's satellite countries are currently meeting in Southern Russia. Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov may also participate. The whereabouts of Romanian Foreign Minister Anna Pauker and Bulgarian Prime Minister Dimitrov are the subject of much speculation here. Both countries' embassies in the United States have made no comment.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Washington, 23rd] In its most candid review of the disputes within the Communist International, Moscow Radio told the Soviet people that they can expect to find stronger communist resistance within the Soviet Union's vassal states. In addition to mentioning the break between Yugoslavia and the Cominform, the broadcast also mentioned the general struggles within the "new democratic countries" of Eastern Europe. The broadcast was titled "The International Communist Movement," has been listened to here, and provided to top government officials for reference.</p>
<p>The broadcast stated that such developments within the party are merely a painful but unsurprising process. Communist parties outside the Soviet Union will achieve great success and triumph everywhere if they uphold the leadership of the Soviet Union and follow "Stalinism."</p>
<p>It stated that public opinion after the break between Tito and the Cominform has actually strengthened the communist movement. This event has prompted "correct reassessment" of their environment in various places and obtained "necessary conclusions". Soviet assistance is the only reason for the eastward trend towards communism in Eastern Europe today, but it is clear that the class struggle within the "new democratic countries" will become more acute, and the use of class resistance will become stronger. The class struggle within foreign communist parties is becoming increasingly clear, and the struggle between the two major fronts has emerged, as we have experienced before. The development of communism cannot be completed without overcoming the struggle of opportunists."</p>
<h3>British Foreign Secretary Returns to Paris</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 23rd] British Foreign Secretary Bevin returned to Paris this morning after a day's stay in London, and immediately drove to the British Embassy to discuss the Berlin incident with Roberts, Strang, and Robertson.</p>
<h3>Foreign Minister Wang Shih-chieh and Nehru to Meet in France</h3>
<p>Discussing Issues of Mutual Interest</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Paris, 22nd] This reporter has just learned from people close to our country's delegation to the United Nations General Assembly that Foreign Minister Wang Shih-chieh plans to meet with Indian Prime Minister Nehru in mid-October to discuss issues of mutual interest. Nehru will attend the British Prime Minister's Conference in London in October and is expected to come here as the chief representative of India to participate in the United Nations General Assembly before or after attending the conference. The attitudes of China and India are exactly the same on several issues in the General Assembly, and to some extent, the attitudes of China and India are the same as those of the Arab countries.</p>
<h3>British Blame Chinese for Malayan Rebellion</h3>
<p>British Participate in Movement to Overthrow Government</p>
<p>[Associated Press, London, 22nd] British Colonial Secretary Jones stated in the House of Commons on the 22nd that the left-wing rebels in Malaya are "mainly Chinese." He said that the situation there is gradually coming under control. About 186 civilians have died, most of whom were Chinese who refused to help the terrorists. About 158 terrorists have been killed, 200 have been captured, and more have been detained for investigation. Jones estimated that the terrorists number about 35,000, but he declined to disclose the number of British troops, only stating that there are 17,000 special police participating in the war there.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, London, 22nd] US Undersecretary of State Matthews stated that some leads in Rangoon indicate that some British people are participating in the Karen movement to overthrow the Burmese government, but "the British government firmly opposes these activities."</p>
<h3>Dewey Delivers Campaign Speech; Demands U.S. Provide Massive Aid to China; Past Aid to China Was Insufficient</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency Reporter Accompanying Dewey's Campaign Train, Albuquerque, New Mexico, 3rd] Republican presidential candidate Dewey called for increased US aid to China tonight. He put aside his previously prepared speech and denounced the "useless and insufficient" US aid to China, saying, "Our aid to China is insufficient and should be greatly increased." In the past year, he has repeatedly accused the United States of insufficient aid to China, so it is expected that if he is elected president, he may ask Congress to increase material, financial, and military aid to China to help China's reconstruction and construction and to eradicate communism.</p>
<h3>South Korea Believes North Korea's Military Strength is Formidable; Soviet Withdrawal is Not a Propaganda Offensive</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Seoul, 23rd] Following the Soviet Union's declaration that the withdrawal of Soviet troops from North Korea would be completed by New Year's Day next year, South Korean circles have expressed neither surprise nor excitement. Most commentators take a realistic attitude, believing that the Soviet move is not a propaganda offensive. The withdrawal of Soviet troops from North Korea will not only not harm the Soviet Union's current position in Korea but will also place it in a favorable position in international politics. The local military strength trained by the Soviet Union in North Korea is nearly 200,000. In his recent policy address, Premier Kim Il-sung of the People's Republic of Korea also emphasized that the "People's Army" will aim for one million troops to resist foreign aggression and defend the motherland. In this situation, Soviet troops can withdraw from North Korea without fear. Furthermore, North Korea borders the Soviet Union, and Soviet troops can still reinforce the Korean border at any time if necessary. Secondly, after the withdrawal of Soviet troops from North Korea, the Soviet Union will have an excuse to demand the withdrawal of US troops stationed in South Korea, which will inevitably put the US and South Korean governments in an embarrassing position. At the same time, it will enhance the position of the Soviet Union and the North Korean regime. Moreover, what everyone fears is that after the withdrawal of Soviet troops from North Korea, the North Korean communist army will launch a "southern invasion," because at that time, the Soviet Union and North Korea will have no legal or ostensible relationship. A North Korean military advance southward will not cause a direct conflict between the US and the Soviet Union.</p>
<h3>Japan's Biggest Corruption Case; Ashida Implicated</h3>
<p>Involving a Wide Range of People, the Case May End Without a Conclusion</p>
<p>[New Asia News Agency, Tokyo, 23rd] The biggest news here recently concerns the Showa Denko scandal, with over a thousand suspects under investigation, including the current Prime Minister, Hitoshi Ashida.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Tokyo, 23rd] Well-informed observers predicted today that the Showa Denko bribery case, one of the largest corruption scandals in modern Japanese history, may soon end without a conclusion because so many important people are involved. Justice Minister Suzuki said on the 22nd: If this matter involves several cabinet members, it will inevitably lead to the resignation of the cabinet. After Suzuki issued the statement, Finance Minister Kurisu immediately denied that he and Prime Minister Ashida were involved in the case.</p>
<h3>Resolution of the Palestine-Jewish Dispute; Bernadotte's Full Proposal; Arab-Jewish Partition to Establish Lasting Peace (Conclusion)</h3>
<p>However, the provisions regarding borders in the UN General Assembly resolution of November 29th of last year should be amended as follows to make them fairer, more appropriate, and more implementable in light of the current actual situation in Palestine: (A) The so-called Negev region, south of a line drawn from the coast near El Majdal, east of Faluja, should be designated as Arab territory (Faluja and El Majdal will both be Arab territories). (B) The boundary line should run from Faluja in a northeasterly direction to Ramle and Lydda (Ramle and Lydda will both be Arab territories); from Lydda, the boundary line will follow the provisions of the UN General Assembly resolution of November 29th. (C) Galilee should be designated as Jewish territory; (C) All areas not included within the borders of the Jewish state should be handled jointly by the Arab League government and the Arab residents of Palestine. However, given the historical relationship and common interests between Transjordan and Palestine, there is reason to merge Palestinian Arab territory and Transjordan territory. As for amendments to the borders of other Arab countries, if possible and necessary, they should still be implemented. (D) The United Nations should provide special guarantees, either through a declaration or other appropriate means, that the borders between Arab and Jewish territories should be respected and maintained, and only amended with the mutual agreement of the parties concerned. (E) Although the port of Haifa is included within the territory of the Jewish state, and the city of Haifa is managed by the Jewish state, the port (including its oil refining facilities and the terminal of the oil pipeline) should be declared a free port; guarantee free access to the port for all Arab countries, and Arab countries should not impede the passage of oil through the pipeline to the refinery in Haifa. The distribution of oil will continue to be handled according to past practices. (F) Lydda Airport should be declared a free airport, guaranteeing access to the airport and the use of its facilities for Jerusalem and the Arab countries concerned. (G) The area included within the city of Jerusalem should be treated separately in accordance with the provisions of the UN General Assembly resolution of November 29th, and should be placed under the effective control of the United Nations, so that the local Arab and Jewish residents can enjoy the maximum degree of appropriate autonomy, so that the holy sites and their monuments, as well as religious freedom, are fully protected, and can be freely accessed. (H) All parties should fully respect the right of free access to Jerusalem by road, rail, or air. (I) The United Nations should affirm the right of Arab refugees to return to their homes in the Jewish-controlled areas as soon as possible, and the supervision and assistance of their resettlement, reoccupation, economic and social reconstruction, and appropriate compensation for the loss of property of those who do not wish to return home should be supervised and assisted by the United Nations Conciliation Commission mentioned in section (K) below. (J) The authorities should fully guarantee and respect the political, economic, social, and religious rights of all Arabs in the Jewish territory of Palestine and all Jews in the Arab territory. The Conciliation Commission stipulated in the following section shall supervise the implementation of this guarantee. The committee must also, at the invitation of both parties, engage in mediation in any effort to exchange residents, so as to eliminate all troublesome minority problems, based on appropriate compensation for property losses. (K) Given the special nature of the Palestinian issue and the dangerous complexity of Jewish-Arab relations, the United Nations should establish a Palestinian Investigation Committee. The mandate of the committee, which has a fixed term, should be accountable to the United Nations and act under the jurisdiction of the United Nations. The committee, which is assisted by United Nations personnel when necessary, should be responsible for the following: (1) To use its mediation position to submit appropriate recommendations to the variable or to the United Nations, and take appropriate steps to ensure that the situation in Palestine continues to guarantee a peaceful adjustment; (2) To take measures that the committee deems appropriate to foster friendly relations between Arabs and Jews; (3) To supervise compliance with the boundaries, roads, railways, free ports, free airports, minority rights, and agreements determined by the United Nations; (4) To promptly report to the United Nations any development in Palestine that is sufficient to change any agreement approved by the United Nations in resolving the Palestinian issue, or to threaten the peace of the region.</p>

<h3>Lin Wang Company Speculation Case; Central Special Criminal Court Approves Original Judgment; Wang Chunzhe to be Executed Within Days; Re-trial File and Execution Order Sent to Shanghai Yesterday</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 23rd] The Central Special Criminal Court in the capital, on the 20th, after deliberation by a panel of five judges, upheld the death sentence in the re-trial of Wang Chunzhe of the Lin Wang Company, and approved its execution. On the 23rd, a special envoy was dispatched to Shanghai with the full re-trial file and the execution order from the Ministry of Justice. The execution is expected to take place within days. The Central Special Criminal Court decided on the death penalty for Wang Chunzhe of the Lin Wang Company because Wang illegally engaged in black market trading of gold, banknotes, Hong Kong dollars, and US dollars. The large scale of illegal speculation between November 1947 and March/April 1948 was sufficient to impact the national economy and cause social unrest. After the government announced emergency economic measures to reform the currency system, the company continued to operate on the black market, with transactions spanning New York, San Francisco, London, Hong Kong, and Shantou. This clearly constituted a deliberate violation of government laws, disruption of finance, and obstruction of suppressing the rebellion. The Shanghai High Special Criminal Court sentenced him to death on September 3rd, and this sentence should be approved for execution.</p>
<h3>Two Westerners Involved in Private Foreign Exchange Speculation; Investigation Completed, Transferred to Special Criminal Court</h3>
<p>[Our Report] Italian national Birolla, the Shanghai representative of the Italian Iter Co. S.A., and British national Navis, a broker, were arrested for continuous private foreign exchange speculation totaling US$174,817.48. After being apprehended by the police, the investigation has been completed and they were transferred to the Special Criminal Court yesterday. After interrogation, they were detained in the detention center.</p>
<h3>Pilot Zhang Enbo Arrested for Selling Gold; Transferred to Special Criminal Court</h3>
<p>[Our Report] Zhang Enbo, a pilot of the Air Navigation Group of the Civil Aviation Administration's Air Transport Corps, was previously suspected of selling gold on the black market. He was apprehended by the police's Economic Crime Division in Room 604 of the Dongya Hotel on Nanjing East Road. On the spot, two suspected letters, 57.4 taels of gold bars and gold nuggets, and US$225 were seized. The case has been investigated by the police, and yesterday Zhang was transferred to the Special Criminal Court for investigation. After a brief interrogation by the prosecutor, he was taken into custody at the Special Criminal Court's detention center.</p>
<h3>Four Banks Suspected of Creating False Accounts; District Attorney's Office Begins Investigation</h3>
<p>[Our Report] The Shanghai branches of the Tongyu Yongji Money Exchange, the Tongyi Trust Company, the Farmers and Merchants Bank, the Datong Bank, and the Yuanfan Bank were found to have violated banking laws by creating false accounts and making false records. After being discovered by the Ministry of Finance and the Shanghai Financial Administration Bureau, the cases were transferred to the District Court yesterday afternoon, which then transferred them to the District Attorney's Office for investigation.</p>
<h3>Comprehensive Registration of Goods and Raw Materials; Deadline of Five Days for Merchants and Factories; Authorities Also Plan City-Wide General Inspection</h3>
<p>[Our Report] Chiang Ching-kuo convened the seventh Economic Inspection Meeting at 11:00 AM yesterday morning, attended by Zhang Shi, Cheng Yi-kuan, Yu Ji-yu, and other relevant personnel. After discussion, it was generally agreed that the initial work of economic control in the city had come to an end. In the future, the focus of the Supervisory Office's work will shift to increasing production and developing commerce. Preparations have already begun. To understand the existing commodities and raw materials in the city, the authorities decided to implement a comprehensive registration. All factories and merchants are required to register the nature and total amount of their stored goods and raw materials with their respective trade associations within the deadline of the 25th to 30th of this month, and the associations will issue registration certificates for verification. The items that must be registered include rice, flour, yarn, cloth, paper, cooking oil, and industrial raw materials. After registration, all stores must strictly sell goods at the fixed price. After the registration is completed, the managing authorities plan to conduct a city-wide general inspection with a force of 5,000 people. If unregistered commodities and raw materials are found, they will be confiscated and the owners will be severely punished.</p>
<h3>Grain Prices Reported Rising in Production Areas; Ban on Rushing to Purchase in Wuxi</h3>
<p>During yesterday's meeting, the city's rice prices were also discussed. It was believed that the recent rise in rice prices in the city was mainly due to reports of rising prices in the Wuxi production area, and the rise in rice prices in Wuxi was due to panic buying from various parties. The Supervisory Office has negotiated with all parties, and in the future, no party will be allowed to rush to purchase in Wuxi. The rise in Shanghai rice prices has been eliminated, so under no circumstances is it allowed to break the fixed price. According to investigations, the city currently has enough grain reserves to last at least half a month. With a continuous supply from other ports in the future, there is no fear of a grain shortage.</p>
<p>Regarding the collection of gold, silver, and foreign currency, the Ministry of Finance has decided to set a deadline. Incidents of carrying gold and banknotes out of the country have already occurred. The Supervisory Office has ordered inspectors to pay close attention.</p>
<h3>Social Bureau Sets Registration Forms</h3>

In the future, members of the Suppression and Construction Brigade will be sent to various places for random inspections. If any concealment or false reporting is found, the goods will be confiscated and the offenders will be punished.</p>
<p>Regarding the industrial raw materials of various factories, the Social Bureau has instructed the Municipal Industrial Association to instruct various factories to report the amount of existing storage, how long it can be maintained, what raw materials are needed, and where they come from before the end of this month, and will try to help solve their problems.</p>
<h3>Confiscated Goods Will Be Auctioned</h3>
<p>[Our Report] According to Director Wu of the Social Bureau, a portion of the sugar confiscated in the city has been decided to be sold off. The disposal of other items such as cotton yarn and cloth is being requested from the Executive Yuan. These materials are currently being sorted out. Some owners of the goods stated that these goods were cotton supplied by the Foreign Trade Association for spinning or entrusted by the headquarters for spinning, and the relevant agencies were notified after the goods were completed, but they did not come to pick them up, so the factories that spun them should not be held responsible. The Social Bureau is investigating this situation. If the goods are indeed public property, the public agencies will be notified to pick them up; otherwise, transfer procedures will be processed. Most of the confiscated materials will be auctioned.</p>
<h3>Okamura's Condition Worsens; Will Be Transferred to Hospital for Treatment</h3>

<h3>Municipal Industrial Association Convenes Various Industries to Discuss Production Raw Material Issues; Will Collect Information as Much as Possible to Provide as Reference for the Authorities</h3>
<p>[Our Report] In order to discuss the supply and demand of raw materials for production and other issues for various important industries in the city, the Municipal Industrial Association convened responsible persons and technicians from the rubber, papermaking, paint making, oil pressing, soap making, leather making, enamel, and flavoring industries at 10:00 AM and 3:00 PM yesterday. In general, the price of finished products has been frozen after the government's "819" price limit, while raw materials are still rising. The difficulty in purchasing diesel and coal fuel makes it likely that work will be suspended at any time. The paper industry's wood pulp quota is only one-tenth of the required amount. At the same time, if the main raw materials for papermaking, such as rags and paper scraps, are purchased at the limited price, they must be mixed with a large amount of garbage and colored waste paper, which cannot be used. The Industrial Association will collect as much information as possible on these difficulties to provide as reference for the authorities, and suggest that ways to effectively improve the situation be found. The Industrial Association will continue to convene chemical raw materials, ink, cement, and other industries today for talks.</p>
<h3>Chiang Ching-kuo Encourages Inspection Personnel; Recognize Goals and Responsibilities; Establish a New Atmosphere; Sacrifice Personal Feelings and Cut Off Social Relationships</h3>

Regarding the raw materials and manufactured goods stored in the city's warehouses, Chiang announced: Registration must be made with the trade associations within a limited time. After the deadline, a general census of the city's warehouses will be mobilized. All unregistered commodities and raw materials that are found will be confiscated. Chiang encouraged all staff members: (1) Work should have a clear goal. Economic work is to save the country and the people, not to make money. (2) You should recognize your own responsibilities. Staff members represent the national government in implementing economic laws. (3) Economic inspection staff must break face and sacrifice personal feelings, and cut off social relationships with relatives and friends to avoid being implicated. (4) A new atmosphere should be established. There should be no improper actions. Comrades in charge should monitor, encourage, advise, and report on each other. Only in this way can the work be successful. If one person's actions are unsafe, the entire work will be affected. (5) The members of the Suppression and Construction Team are responsible for assisting the Economic Police Brigade in performing the nature of their work. There should be no distance or boundaries between each other. They should unite sincerely and integrate into one. Chiang said at the end: We are implementing economic tasks in accordance with the government's economic laws and regulations, so personnel should not have any scruples when performing this task, but must be very careful.</p>

<p>Moreover, amidst the panic surrounding Western medicine, the selling price of national medicine is also facing reduced sources and difficulty in sales due to significant price differences across regions.

<p>Zhou Naihao Prosecuted for Maliciously Accusing Ding Hao of Drug Use Due to Personal Grievances</p>
<p>Zhou Naihao, the Director-General of the China Relief for Women and Children General Association, had disagreements with Ding Hao, the Chief Secretary of the association, and harbored resentment. Recently, Zhou Naihao was accused by Ding Hao in the District Procuratorate of crimes such as fraud, embezzlement, and obstruction of freedom.

<p>The Term of the Regulations on Prohibiting Opium and Drugs Expires; District Court to Try Cases According to Our Laws</p>
<p>[This Newspaper Report] The responsible judge in charge of opium and drug cases in the District Court said yesterday: The Regulations on Prohibiting Opium and Drugs and Punishing Crimes expired on August 2 of this year, nearly two months ago. It is unknown whether they will continue to be valid, as the Legislative Yuan has not yet discussed and passed a resolution. Courts in various regions are at a high point in advocating for the elimination of opium and drugs, and it is also inconvenient to adjudicate according to the "Opium Chapter" of the ordinary criminal law. Therefore, it is only possible to temporarily suspend these cases and handle them after the laws and regulations are promulgated. As a result, opium addicts in custody are anxiously awaiting a decision, and the police and court personnel handling the cases are also worried and helpless. Everyone hopes that the Legislative Yuan will decide as soon as possible whether to extend the implementation period of the Regulations on Prohibiting Opium and Drugs and Punishing Crimes. It is reported that the District Procuratorate has already filed multiple cases according to the ordinary criminal law, but they are all backlogged and have not been processed.</p>
<p>Subcommittee of the Council to Regularly Review the Articles of Association of the Public Transportation Company</p>

According to the resolution of the general meeting, the above-mentioned company can proceed with procedures such as soliciting shares and formally establish itself first, and then submit it to the eighth general meeting of the Council for ratification. This company is closely related to the municipal construction of Shanghai, so the decision of the subcommittee meeting on the 27th is particularly important. It is hoped that if the subcommittee's review of the articles of association proceeds smoothly, commercial shares can be solicited starting in the middle of next month. The total amount of these commercial shares is equivalent to five million Gold Yuan, which should be of considerable help in absorbing idle funds and indirectly stabilizing prices.</p>

<p>Promote the Movement of Diligence and Thrift, Awaken Citizens to Practice It</p>
<p>A Meeting Was Held Yesterday at the Queen's Theatre</p>
<p>The Shanghai All-Circles Promotion of National Diligence and Thrift Movement Propaganda Meeting was held at 9:00 AM on the 23rd at the Queen's Theatre on Xizang Road. The presidium included Wu Guozhen, Pan Gongzhan, Fang Zhi, Jin Longzhang, Jiang Weizhi, Zhu Jingnong, Du Yuesheng (represented by Zhu Wende), Xu Jiquing, Zhou Feicheng, Feng Youzhen, Zheng Yuxiu, Hou Junren, and more than 3,000 representatives from various circles. Zheng Yanye, a member of the Central Thrift Guidance Committee, and Ni Bi, a supervising committee member of the Jiangsu-Zhejiang Administrative Office, were invited to attend and provide guidance. The meeting hall was decorated with large banners reading "Soldier-like Life on the Front Line" and "Civilian-like Life in the Rear." Mayor Wu served as the chairman and delivered a speech after leading the attendees in a group ceremony. He first pointed out the virtues of diligence and thrift advocated by Chinese sages and emphasized that the Chinese people should uphold the spirit of seeking from oneself rather than from others to overcome current difficulties. Currently, people's livelihoods are declining, and production is insufficient. The only solution is diligence and thrift. He hopes that the five million citizens of Shanghai will rise up and respond to the President's initiative to promote national diligence and thrift, so that the country can become prosperous and happy.</p>
<p>Speak Less About Rights, Emphasize Spirituality More</p>
<p>Then, Committee Member Zheng delivered a speech, stating: In order to awaken the general public to vigorously promote national diligence and thrift, propaganda is essential. However, propaganda should also grasp the key to practice and must be coordinated with organization. The implementation of this currency system reform has already made Shanghai a national model. It is hoped that all compatriots in the city will step up their efforts. The success of Shanghai is a prelude to the success of the entire country. Chairman Xu of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce delivered a speech, stating: Diligence and thrift must start from oneself and must have perseverance. Committee Member Ni Bi delivered a speech, stating: To quell the chaos, we must first eliminate the source of the chaos. In other words, we must ensure that everyone has food to eat. We must know that the poorer we are, the more chaotic it becomes, and the more chaotic it becomes, the poorer we are. We must eliminate the communist bandits' conspiracy to create poverty and chaos and exploit social crises to sell out the country. We must first learn diligence and thrift from Westerners, not just vainly admire the enjoyment of life. We should fulfill our obligations more and talk less about rights, emphasize spirituality more, and talk less about material things in order to build the country. Zhu Jingnong, speaking from the perspective of the education sector, hopes that everyone will do their best and take what they need. He hopes that Shanghai students will take the lead in advocating for movements such as wearing plain clothes and engaging in labor so that the education sector can become a model. Speaker Pan Gongzhan delivered a speech, stating: The diligence and thrift movement advocated by the President is the movement of practice. The life of officers and soldiers on the front line should be soldier-like, and the life of wealthy people in the rear should be civilian-like. He also loudly called on the government to apply various policies and laws, such as heavily taxing luxury goods and using this tax revenue to specifically fund civilian welfare programs to achieve the goal of taking from the rich and using for the poor.</p>
<p>Do Your Best, Take What You Need</p>
<p>Committee Member Fang delivered a speech, first using a tone of feeling to point out the unreasonable phenomenon between luxurious life and civilian life, which should be eliminated. The most unfair thing in the world is the inequality in life, because inequality in life leads to inequality in people's hearts, eventually leading to bloody social revolution. The purpose of the revolution led by the Father of the Nation and the President is to seek the realization of the Principle of People's Livelihood, so that people's lives, social survival, the lives of the masses, and the livelihood of the country are all guaranteed. Today, we are awakening the working masses to this bloodless social movement and should practice the principle of "doing our best and taking what we need." He expressed his willingness to learn from the working masses and strive for thrift in his personal life in the future. His only hobby, cigarettes, will also be quit immediately, and he is willing to take the lead in taking off his suit and changing into a Zhongshan suit to advocate the movement of diligence and thrift in fact.</p>
<p>The Meeting Passed Telegram Proposals</p>
<p>At the meeting, two proposals and a telegram were passed. Finally, the entire meeting shouted slogans, and China Electric screened educational production films. The telegram and proposals of the meeting are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>To all compatriots across the country, transferred to all newspapers in provinces and cities across the country: Banditry is rampant, and social customs are declining. While soldiers are shedding blood to suppress bandits on the front lines, and compatriots are displaced and fleeing in all directions, the idle and extravagant officials, wealthy merchants and gentry, and parasitic elements speculate and exploit, indulge in extravagance, and indulge in enjoyment, disregarding the country and the nation and turning a blind eye to the suffering of their compatriots. If this trend is not corrected, the country will perish one day. Our President Chiang Kai-shek, with true knowledge and insight, clearly observed the ills of the times and initiated the National Diligence and Thrift Movement, calling on compatriots across the country to believe in and practice it, to fight injustice for society, to fight for the survival of the working masses, and to use it as a starting point for coordinating economic and political mobilization, transforming society, and thoroughly implementing the Principle of People's Livelihood. This meeting is deeply moved by the leader's sincere patriotism to save the country and the people and the importance of the National Diligence and Thrift Movement. It sincerely appeals and earnestly hopes that those who are lazy, extravagant, speculative, and exploitative will wake up in time, repent, abide by the covenant, refrain from extravagance, and vigorously practice diligence and thrift. It especially hopes that diligent people will sincerely persuade those who indulge in extravagance and pleasure and are idle and extravagant to turn back to the shore. Those who are obsessed and forget to return should be closely reported and given public opinion sanctions and moral condemnation. We must strive to revitalize social customs and create a new look, which will not only be a blessing for individuals but also a blessing for the country. Shanghai All-Circles Diligence and Thrift Promotion National Propaganda Conference Shen Geng Hou.</p>
<p>Proposals: (1) In order to vigorously promote thrift, it is proposed that the Executive Yuan promptly promulgate customary systems so that people's lives have something to follow and conform to the purpose of national diligence and thrift. (2) In order to enable people across the country to universally and deeply understand the meaning of the National Diligence and Thrift Movement, it is proposed that the central government compile a handbook on national diligence and thrift and distribute it to various provinces and cities to facilitate practice.</p>
<p>Business and Industry Fully Support</p>
<p>The City Industry Association, the City Chamber of Commerce, and the Local Association jointly telegraphed President Chiang yesterday, supporting the National Diligence and Thrift Movement he initiated and telegraphed various Tongle Guilds to respond in unison.</p>
<p>Also, all directors and supervisors of the City Bank Association, in response to the National Diligence and Thrift Movement, issued a statement to the industry yesterday, stating: On the evening of September 15, President Chiang initiated the Diligence and Thrift National Building Movement through radio broadcasting, formulated an outline, and announced it to the entire country. His words were earnest and moving. Our Bank Association is one of the professional organizations and should rise up in time, follow the trend, and promote this movement so that social customs can be changed, and all operations of our industry can naturally be brought into the right track. Now is the beginning of the Diligence and Thrift Movement. The Executive Yuan has established a Thrift Guidance Committee. Our industry believes that the relationship between diligence and thrift and production and consumption is extremely close, which can directly stabilize prices and indirectly consolidate the Gold Yuan. Under the premise of our industry's full support for the Gold Yuan, it is extremely necessary to work with the government to fulfill its responsibilities.</p>
<p>Levy Luxury Donation</p>
<p>The Objects are Dance Halls, Cafés and Wine Banquets, Which Will Be Transferred to Public Utilities as Subsidies</p>
<p>Regarding the promotion of the National Diligence and Thrift Movement in this city, the municipal authorities recently received instructions from the central government to levy luxury donations on all luxury goods and extravagant entertainment under the principle of prohibition in levying. According to the person in charge of the Thrift Movement Committee, the principle of levying luxury donations has been decided, and the specific methods of levying and donation rates are being drafted. However, the objects of luxury donation are difficult to determine and need to be discussed in detail with all relevant parties. As for the use of the luxury donation, it will be allocated to public utilities companies as subsidies to reduce the cost of public utilities and make their selling prices cheaper. Luxury donations will also be levied on dance halls, cafés, and wine banquets that are not thrifty.</p>

<p>A Record of the Rise and Fall of the Wuhu Rice Market</p>
<p>Special Correspondent of This Newspaper Zhu Minwei</p>
<p>(1) The History of the Wuhu Rice Market</p>
<p>The Wuhu Rice Market was established in the 8th year of the Guangxu Emperor's reign (1882) and has been around for 77 years. Originally, the Jiangnan rice markets were located in Zhenjiang Qihaokou, Wuxi, and Zhejiang Xiashi Town. Li Hongzhang, for the sake of hometown friendship, actually moved the Zhenjiang rice market to Wuhu. It can be said that a political figure used his political power to benefit the people of his hometown and to honor a port in his hometown. In fact, Wuhu is also suitable as a market for food transactions in terms of economic concentration and transportation hub. However, if it had not been for this Anhui authority's submission, it might not have been so easy to take away the rice market of the capital of Jiangsu Province. (Note: Before and after the establishment of the rice market, Li Hongzhang and his family acquired ownership of one-third of the urban land in the Wuhu area, about 3,000 acres, through purchase or gift. These urban lands are now divided and managed by the descendants of the Li family.)</p>
<p>(2) Annual Transaction Volume of the Rice Market</p>
<p>The food-producing areas of Anhui Province are divided into the Southern Anhui region, the Jiangbei region (also known as the Chaohu region), and the Huaihe region. The food of the Huaihe region is traded and exported mainly through Bengbu. The Jiangbei region and the Southern Anhui region mainly trade in rice, followed by other grains. The food of these two regions is traded and exported mainly through Wuhu. Since the establishment of the market during the late Qing Dynasty, exports have been busy for four months from September when the Indica rice is harvested, and slow for four months until May of the following year, when it enters the lean season. The rice market temporarily closes, and miscellaneous grains become active again. From May to October, rapeseed, corn, soybeans, and other miscellaneous grains are traded continuously. Therefore, the Wuhu food market can be said to be lively all year round. During the busy season of the autumn harvest, the rice trade can reach 100,000 bags per day (each bag weighing 200 catties). The number of bags transported by sailboats and ships each month is about 300,000 at most. The annual export of rice alone has reached 2 million bags, and at least 1 million bags. The average annual export of rice is more than 1.5 million bags, and the number of miscellaneous grains is about 500,000 bags. The initial export destinations were Guangzhou, Shantou, and other places in South China. Later, various ports in North China also came to purchase rice, and Tianjin, Qingdao, Yantai, and other places also became export destinations. Therefore, those engaged in the rice business in Wuhu were initially mostly from Guangdong. Later, more people from Tianjin and Shandong provinces gradually arrived. Currently, the transportation industry in the Wuhu rice industry's five gangs is mostly from the north and south seas, Guangdong, Shandong, Hebei, and other places.</p>
<p>(3) Current Situation</p>
<p>Due to the needs of rice and grain trading and processing, the Wuhu grain industry is divided into five gangs, each engaged in its own business:</p>
<p>(1) Rice Hulling Industry</p>
<p>(2) Rice Milling Factory and Warehouse Industry</p>
<p>(3) Miscellaneous Grain Industry</p>
<p>(4) Rice Industry</p>
<p>(5) Transportation Industry</p>
<p>Among them, the rice hulling industry and the rice milling factory and warehouse industry are factory-type businesses that process rice. Rice hulling uses old-fashioned wooden rice hullers and is an outdated rice processing factory. Rice milling factories use diesel or electricity to power rice milling machines. Currently, there are about 20 of each. Because of the long distance and large transportation capacity of the north and south seas, purchasers buy rice rather than rice. This has allowed Wuhu to have these 40 or so rice hulling and rice milling factories. In addition to processing rice, these two industries also operate warehouses. Buyers of rice and miscellaneous grains need to store the rice and grain properly for transportation before it is shipped out to distant places. Therefore, the rice hulling and rice milling factories are equipped with ventilated and spacious warehouses for storing rice for transportation, which also generates a "rental" fee.</p>
<p>The miscellaneous grain industry and the rice industry are both seller representatives or brokers. These two industries do not require any capital equipment. They only need a brand and hire a few skilled workers to start a business, so there are many people engaged in this. There are about 300 miscellaneous grain companies and about 120 rice companies (also known as Jiangguang companies, formerly known as buying rice from the three Jiangs and selling it to the two Guangs). These two industries represent small rice merchants from various counties and towns or even farmers selling their products and charge commissions. They are completely intermediary merchants.</p>
<p>Finally, the transportation industry is a broker representing buyers from Tianjin, Qingdao, Guangzhou, Shantou, and other places. Like the rice industry and the miscellaneous grain industry, it is an intermediary merchant. However, many people who have been engaged in this industry for decades have accumulated a great deal of wealth. For example, the chairman of this industry, Li Nianci, has assets of about hundreds of thousands of dan of rice. He has been engaged in this industry for decades. Transportation companies representing buyers from other places must have credit and capital to operate. Otherwise, even if they set up a brand, no one from other places will entrust them with purchasing. Therefore, there are not many companies in this industry, only 70 or so. After the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, it was more convenient to purchase rice from Burma and Vietnam in South China, and there was less demand for rice from the Yangtze River basin. North China is closer to Central China in terms of transportation, and most of its rice is supplied by Anhui Province. Therefore, the transportation industry in Wuhu has been busier in the Shandong and Tianjin gangs in the past three years, while the Guangshan gang, which was once famous, has been worse off.</p>
<p>The distribution areas of these five industries are concentrated along the Wei River and Qingyi River due to their reliance on water transportation of food. The rice hulling and rice milling factories and warehouses are located along the Qingyi River. The rice shops and transportation companies are located on Huasheng Street along the Yangtze River. The miscellaneous grain shops are distributed in the streets inside and outside the four gates of the old city of Wuhu and along the Qingyi River.</p>
<p>(4) Costs Added to Rice Entering and Leaving the Wuhu Market</p>
<p>The costs added to one dan of rice passing through the Wuhu food market are detailed below:</p>
<p>(1) Commission (income of the rice shop): 0.34 yuan</p>
<p>(2) Fee (income of the transportation company's grain shop): 0.83 yuan</p>
<p>(3) Packing fee (income of the workers): 0.07 yuan</p>
<p>(4) Loading and unloading labor (income of the workers): 0.25 yuan</p>
<p>(5) Round fee (income of the warehouse): 0.02 yuan</p>
<p>(6) Special self-defense donation (collected by the Anhui Provincial Government): 6 sheng of rice, valued at about 0.96 yuan</p>
<p>(7) Rice donation of the Rice Industry Association (income of the Five Gangs Rice Association): 0.01 yuan</p>
<p>(8) National tax of 12 per thousand (collected by the National Taxation Bureau): 12 per thousand, calculated at a price of 16 yuan per dan, is 0.192 yuan</p>
<p>(9) Business tax (collected by the county tax office): 0.3 yuan</p>
<p>(10) Irregular loading and unloading fees (income of workers and dock heroes): variable</p>
<p>Total: 2.972 yuan</p>
<p>The current price limit for brown rice in Wuhu is 16 yuan per dan. After adding all the necessary miscellaneous fees, it becomes 18.972 yuan. Among them, merchants, workers, and local governments each attack the other party for earning too much or not deserving it, and the interests are not reduced, resulting in the high rice prices in Wuhu and making it unaffordable for buyers in the north and south seas and other regions.</p>
<p>(Note: Processing fees and warehouse rent are not included in the export price of each dan of rice, so they are not counted.)</p>
<p>(5) Consequences</p>
<p>Grain shops representing buyers have already moved to Nanjing, Zhenjiang, and Wuxi. Rice companies have changed their location to He County and Yuxikou Town across the Wuhu River, and Dongguan Iron Mine, where the Anhui and Jiangsu borders meet. The autumn harvest in Wuhu this year has been going on for many days. The rice and grain produced in the Jiangbei region are not sold in Wuhu, and the rice in Southern Anhui is exported through Dongguan or Dangtu County instead of Wuhu. Purchasers rarely come to Wuhu and first order from Wuxi, so the consequences are already obvious.</p>
<p>A Major Fire in Chengdong, Nantong: "Refugee Village" Completely Destroyed</p>
<p>[This Newspaper, Nantong, 23rd] A major fire broke out in Nanyuan, Chengdong at 6:00 PM today, destroying more than 100 residential houses. The fire had not stopped as of 8:30 PM. The area is a gathering place for refugees from rural areas. The newly built tiled and thatched houses were only a few months old and were known as "Refugee Village." They are now completely destroyed. The cause of the fire was carelessness in preparing dinner.</p>
<p>The Beginning of New Anhui</p>
<p>This Newspaper Reporter Bao Baiping</p>
<p>—A Conversation with Chairman Xia Wei—</p>
<p>[This Newspaper, Hefei, 21st] When the news of Xia Wei taking over Anhui was published in the newspapers, it was a major event for the people of Anhui. In the processes of the Anti-Japanese War, victory, demobilization, and suppression of bandits, the political situation in Anhui remained unchanged for nine long years. Today, it has changed, just as the suppression of bandits is being intensified and a total war is being implemented.</p>
<p>On the afternoon of the 14th, the streets were full of red and green slogans. The heads of various agencies gathered outside the East Gate to welcome a new figure. Chairman Xia arrived and said to the reporter in his first sentence that he had come to faithfully serve the 30 million people of Anhui, build a new Anhui, and would talk in detail another day. At his inauguration ceremony on the 16th, he proposed two slogans: "Implement a total war and build a new Anhui!" To achieve this goal, he put forward four requirements: "Seeking peace, seeking equality, seeking wealth, and seeking education," and four work styles: "Upholding integrity, valuing ability, seeking innovation, and being practical." This is his policy for governing Anhui. He said that he would immediately formulate and implement a policy outline and implementation plan and that what was required was the cooperation and full support of 30 million compatriots.</p>
<p>On one occasion, Chairman Xia had a long conversation with the reporter.</p>
<p>Thirty years of military life and hundreds of battles have forged him into a strong and resolute soldier. At the age of 55, he does not show the signs of aging on his full face. Speaking in a Rong County dialect that is not purely Guangxi, he talked eloquently about the beautiful vision of Anhui.</p>
<p>First, he said in a firm tone: "Anhui is located in a strategic location and has abundant resources. Throughout history, many talented people have emerged and have glorious historical pages. After eight years of the Anti-Japanese War and three years of banditry, it is full of devastation and needs to be revived. Today, during the period of suppressing bandits and implementing constitutionalism, we must step up the work of building the province!"</p>
<p>The reporter asked how to seek peace today, leading the topic to the "four seeks." He said painfully: "Since there has been banditry in the Jianghuai region, I have seen the people displaced and suffering, which is too tragic. If the banditry is not eliminated, everything in politics and economy will be affected. What is the same as the bandits is the bad political atmosphere. Some corrupt officials, local tyrants, and evil gentry collude with each other, endanger the local area, and exploit the people, which is even more hateful. In the future, in addition to strengthening the suppression of bandits, we must also strike against the current corrupt officials, local tyrants, and evil gentry, so that the people can be stable."</p>
<p>"After stability, we must seek equality, which means uniformity and fairness. Taking Hefei as an example, there are special people who take pride in not paying grain and not paying taxes, but they do not know that they have violated the law, which is absolutely not allowed. In the future, not only will the burden of suppressing bandits be required to be equal and fair, but also the benefits of social construction will be required to be shared equally. At a minimum, we must achieve public education for the young, public care for the elderly, and public medical care for the sick (this is his three-public system). This is true equality. After the Second World War, the Labor Party came to power in the United Kingdom and implemented socialism and controlled the economy, which made production increase and prices stable. This is because of public management and reasonable distribution, so the phenomenon of inequality between the rich and the poor has gradually been eliminated. At the same time, we must seek wealth. This wealth is not personal wealth, but the development of resources, the increase of production, and the improvement of the living standards of the</p>
<h3>Fire at the Shunchang Road Printing House</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] At 6:50 PM yesterday, a fire broke out carelessly on the upper floor of the Guolian Printing House, numbers 4-5, Lane 286, Shunchang Road. The fire spread rapidly, eventually burning down one room on the upper floor and extending to the adjacent number 6 building.</p>
<h3>Large Quantities of Copper-Nickel Coins Arrive for Remelting; Hai Liao Vessel to Continue to Japan with a Batch of Returning Japanese</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Hai Liao vessel, which transported back over 1,860 tons of copper-nickel coins (packed in over 23,940 wooden boxes) looted in the past from Osaka, Japan, along with over 500 tons of compensation materials loaded from Sasebo, arrived in Shanghai on Tuesday evening this week. After docking at the Zhanghuabang Railway Wharf to unload the compensation materials, it has now moved to the Huangpu Wharf to unload the copper-nickel coins. It is expected that unloading will be completed by the end of the week. The vessel will continue to Japan next Wednesday, carrying over 2,100 tons of barter goods, as well as 92 Japanese nationals returning home and 48 Japanese crew members who previously arrived in Shanghai on the Yongyuan vessel. After setting sail, the vessel will first proceed to Sasebo, and after the Japanese nationals and crew members have disembarked, it will proceed to Kobe to unload cargo, and finally to Osaka to continue loading copper-nickel coins for return to China.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the copper-nickel coins arriving in Shanghai will be transported to the Central Mint for remelting into gold yuan auxiliary currency.</p>
<h3>Central Government Approves US$80,000 in Foreign Exchange to Alleviate Shortage of Western Medicine in the City; Zhang Wei and Representatives of the Western Medicine Trade Association Return to Shanghai from Beijing</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] It is learned that in order to address the shortage of essential Western medicines in the city, the authorities, after the Health Bureau Chief Zhang Wei went to Beijing to request assistance, have approved US$80,000 in foreign exchange to purchase 100,000 vials of penicillin, 10,000 vials of a special drug for lung disease, and other medicines, which is certainly good news for patients in the city. According to investigations by relevant parties, the actual stock of Western medicines in the city is not lacking. Since 1946, Western medicines worth approximately US$100 million have been imported. However, most of these medicines have been used by non-industry individuals as collateral for investments, and therefore remain stored in warehouses, unable to be distributed to pharmacies for sale.</p>
<p>[Another Dispatch] Health Bureau Chief Zhang Wei recently went to Beijing to request instructions from the Ministry of Health on enriching the city's medicine supply and continuing to allocate US aid funds to subsidize epidemic prevention and healthcare services. Coincidentally, Shi Zhifu and others, representatives of the New Leaf Trade Association and the Pharmaceutical Industry Association, also traveled to Beijing on the same train. They separately requested the Executive Yuan and the Ministry of Health to increase import quotas for medicines or grant a one-time special quota in order to order medicines urgently needed in the city and alleviate the current medicine shortage. They jointly returned to Shanghai yesterday. It is learned that the Executive Yuan and the Ministry of Health have, in principle, agreed to consider the above request, but the types and quantities of imported medicines still need to be re-examined. As for the medicines donated to China under the U.S. aid program, they will soon arrive in Shanghai and are expected to be distributed to various hospitals for collection soon.</p>
