<p>〔本報南京十一日電〕立委端木傑等卅一人，頃已提出擬咨請政府頒行大赦案，然該院程序委會之意見則以為「按憲法第五十八條規定，大赦案由行政會議議決提出，第六十三條規定，立法院有議決大赦之權，又立法院組織法第十五條，僅規定立法委員法津案之提出，至於大赦案可否提出，尙無明文規定，似有待司法院之解釋」，故已將該案列為報吿事項，定於十三日會中提出。該案辦法中擬定：（一）赦免對象，限犯罪在本年五月二十日總統就職日前者。（二）最重本刑爲有期徒刑以下者均予赦免，最重本刑爲死刑，無期徒刑者，减輕二分之一（記者按原案如此，但如何計算，實茲疑問）。（三）戰犯，漢奸，貪污，弒親及煙毒等察罪犯，均不予赦減，唯立院算是否可提出大赦案，旣已引起蕪法之解釋間題，此事殆已非短期內可獲解決者。</p>

<h3 id="c27">注意英國修築印藏公路！ <a href="#c27" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e27" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">27</a></h3>
<p>中國在逐息中，國防安全和邊福安全，也已潮感威脅。從地理形勢看，東北山河變了色，新區內羅動盪不安，滇緬滇越邊界爭論朱決，而西藏西康又傳來驚人的淸息。據近週連續的報進：英國現在我康廠邊境積極修築公路，直通印度阿臨密省之鬼地距。我中央地方當局正密切注意該路修築情形，即向英印進行交涉。離印度駐華大使聲明並無其事，但究竟如何，尙待更具體的證明。這件事關係我西陲邊防安全甚大，如果屬書，我們應該向英印提出嚴重抗議，同時並應以外交和內政的途徑，採取有效措施，制止英國越境築路的非法行動。</p>
<p>西國西康為我西陸邊境，地位重要。數千年的歷史說明了：康藏內動亂，不僅關係川眞三省的安危，並且影響歷史的變遷。昔人治邊，必先確保康藏，安定康藏。由於滿淸治邊政策的失當，加以英帝國勢力的西侵，逐使西藏問題日趨複雜嚴重，幾被英帝國席卷而去。十二世達賴喇嘛統治西藏四十年，一貫的親英反漢，如非國民革命的成功，中央對藏政策的開明容忍，西藏恐早已走向獨立之路。民廿二年達賴園寂，由四大呼團克圖之一的熱振活佛攝政，西藏情勢急趨好轉，熟振一反達賴的作為，對中央的抗戰作熱烈的支持，並撤减了成脅康邊的兵力。西藏人民愛　熱振，也支持他內向的政策，可惜政府無暇西臘，放過了妥蓄解決西藏問題的觀會。民國卅一年熱振退休，將攝政的地位讓給他的老師達札，相約雨年後交遼政權。去年二月熟振被謀害，三大寺之一的色拉寺，有五千喇嘛被達札殲滅，道次政敎巨變之後，西藏的政治又完全被親英派耙持，一反熟振的作爲，竟企圖以獨立地位向英日美發生「外交」關係。觀於去年汎亞洲會議集會印度，西藏代表國的獨立活動，以及最近西藏商務代表團的訪美，即可知其蛛絲馬跡。</p>
<p>英人修築康藏公路，原不是最近的事，乃是去年西藏政變後開始發生的。所遺憾的是：外交內政當局未予注視，採取有效步驟制止其發展，致有今日漸趨嚴重的事態。去年八月廿七日本報重慶專電說：關於英人於康藏邊境狢獪·察隅·波密等地，修築公路，渝綏署已令康滇兩省密切注意，並設法搜集證件，以作有力交涉的依機。滇省府更令該區專署轉飭隣近康印之德欽，黃山，福貢，碧江，瀘水等設治局嚴査詳報。頃經證實：由塞地亞起修之公路，尙未到達察隅，近由察隅西南約百華里之瓦隆繼續北修，預料卅七年底完工。英國與西藏的條件，每年允許厰商由察地亞阪運槍械及日用品。此項工程修至察隅後，即由東北部之桑昂（料麥）北修歪實都（病木多），另紹波密及太昭可抵阿讓密，織印轉個臘，可不鰓漢讓，現在織印分界盧，駐有英印軍官，優境樹立之大石，上刻有英漢印等文字，漢文寫「有期自邊方來，不亦樂乎！」又今年五月消息，印藏公路已修至格施部，如無阻礙，本年底即可修至四康。</p>
<p>根據一年來不斷的報道，和官方的報吿，英閱修築印藏公路遺件事，似乎不僅是確實有證的事，並且是且有重大意義的一種企圖。這外鍱勢力的滲遠康跋，把印康厰巨川峻嶺的交通溝通起來，決不能以通商實易的理由作解釋，這對於川·滇·靑·康，安全的威骨，是不可想傳的。我們應該向英印提出有力的抗議，並有效制止印藏公路的修築。</p>
<p>西藏是我國的地方，英國與我地方自治政府擅立築路契約，是這反公法，妨害我國主權的措施。這種措施，在中英條約關係上，和中英友好邦交的發展上，都不免是損失。我們抗議英國妨害我領土主權的措施，並希望明快的英國政府，制止這種不友好的行動，以免糾紛擴大。</p>
<p>最後，我們要喚起中央政府的注意：爲了確保國防安全和邊疆安定，我們應該採取積極的疆邊政策，防止外鑠因素，以求自保；實施澈底的內政改革，促進邊地政治經濟的進步，導致社會風尙種族文化，儘量向內交流，逐漸走向中華一家的大目標。我們唯有這種的努力，纔能够確保邊疆，防止分化！</p>

<p>〔南京訊〕立委駱淸華吿記者：臨時財產稅草案，是要「從物找人」，豪門資本，早已逃避海外。當初救濟特捐是要一從人找錢」，就是「壽着豪門令他捐助」，而今督導救濟特捐的劉不同先生說：「豪富的財富，不是投資於營利事業，就是購買土地」，如此則豪門資財並未逃避，而劉先生過去從參政院到立法院所作「徵用國人在美存款」的呼聲，悉成無的放矢了。記得勝利之初，在大後方的機器工業，會經自願集體捐獻廠產，請求政府接收全部技工，目前上海千餘家機器工廠，亦幾陷於不能維持的境地，機器業為工業之母，沒落至此，其他可以想見。現在的農工商業最好的估計，亦不過「有產無財」，如果財產以之為主要對象，其結果不外「徙滋苛擾，無裨國庫」，吾人必須貫澈使真正有錢者出錢，使總統有權制定法令，籌措戡亂經費，對豪富派銷戡亂公債，只要政府有決心，豪門巨室屈指可數，不必殃及池魚，鬧得舉國不安。財產稅之名目，在我國雖尚新穎悅耳，可以刺激人心，但仍須熟權利害，不宜輕於嘗試。預料此案在立院中必能獲得適當之解決。</p>
<h3 id="c44">提出法律案問題　司法監察兩院均應有權　憲法疏漏司法院主張會商解決 <a href="#c44" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e44" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">44</a></h3>
<p>司法院意見</p>
<p>〔本報南京十一日電〕關於監疑院向立法院提出法律案問題，司漢院特提出意見於總統府二會商，並由于院長提出於中一日之談品會報吿，　蘇會文如次：</p>
<p>關於　　上六軍　，　內　文　　之不同　發生書，有民然　文規定兩發生者，依照各國運　，均馬於黨玦之蘇　，此項　　，經有解　　法職權之機關解　　，即作爲定案，廣　修改憲法有所變更　為止。</p>
<p>此次立法院與監察院意見之不同，係因憲法無明文規定監察院得向立法院提出法律案（關於行政院，考試院則有第五十八條，第八十七條之規定），此種問題，原屬於憲法之解憲，但我國憲法對於院興院間之爭議，另有第四十四條規定如左：</p>
<p>總統對於院與院間之爭執，除憲法有規定者外，得　　有關各監院長會　解決之。上　條文稱會尙，而不云會議，實貝有調解意義，在溝通院與院間不同之意見，而歸一是，但下其識決案之　式，强小數以服從大數也（參考中　民國　法草案說明書滿四十五餘說明），會　　　　，雙方意見如　一致，郞由關係　各自召開會議（詞　區無院會議而有大法官會議）作成決議案，以爲實施之依據，詡雙方意見未臻調協，則有待於憲法之解釋，以憑取決。</p>
<p>至於總統對於職權內之事項能否向立法院提出法律案之問題，似宜同時研討，以便應用時有所依據。</p>
<p>復査五五憲草第六十九條親定：「行政，司法，考試，監察各院關於其主管事項，得向立法院提出議案」。該條說明認爲：「在三權分立之國家，政府有不能提同議案於會議者，每有扦格不通之病，在五權憲法，五院雖各自獨立行使職機，但仍多關聯之處，且行政，司法，考試，善察各院的其主管事項，知之最審，應許其提出議案於立法院」。其理由本極正確，　協商會議主張責汪內閣制，故初　將上項提出議案之　專　諸行政院，厥後後以所採究其報　責任內閣制，而當時有人主張考試院對於所有事項恐有向立法院提出法律之權，最後稿遂倂特此權界考試院，其提出於制憲國民大會之草案第九十二條載：「考試院關於所掌事項提出法律案時，由考試院秘書長出席立法院說明之」。經第一審查委員會審査修正爲：「考試院關於所掌事項，得向立法院提出法律案」。即憲法第八十七條，經過情形大致如此。行政院之外，獨許考試院有向立法院提出法律案之權，司法·監察兩院則均向隅，洵起草時之一疏漏，亟應會商解決之。</p>
<p>總之，憲法雖無明文規定，於情於理，司法·監察兩院均應同有向立法院提出法律案之權，而此標祗限於所當事項，最後之決定，仍在立法院，於立法權之行使，實無妨碍。</p>
<p>監察院意見</p>
<p>〔本報南京十一日電〕監院以向立院提法律案之問題，提出於總統召集右關院院長會商之會義席上之意見如次：</p>
<p>監察院向立法院提出法律案之事貨經過及理由，茲分述於後：</p>
<p>（一）事實經過：</p>
<p>（一）監察院爲行使憲法所賦予之職權，茲擬訂監察法草案，提經六月十九日等五次會議通過，並決議「咨請立法院迅即完成立法程序」等語，經於廿一日檢同草案容送立法院審議。又擬訂監察院各委員會組織條例草案，經六月廿二·廿三·廿四等日第七·八·九等次會議通過，並決議「咨請立法院迅予完成立法程序」等語，經於廿四日檢同草案咨法立法院。</p>
<p>（二）六月廿六日准立法院法制委員會函，以定於六月廿八日下午三時，審査監察法草案，鬼派員列席說明。經本院六月廿八日第十二次會議公推田烔錦·奮鴻烈·陳慶華三委負前往參加。旋據田委員烔錦等於廿九日第十三次會議報吿，以立法院對於本院所提法案，因意法無明文規定，不能接受等語。</p>
<p>（三）在六月三十日第十四次會議時，委負陳大機，鴻烈。李正樂等提出開於監療院提出法律案問個，經討論後決驕，推定田委晨烔錦等二十二委員，組織監察院提出法律案問題研究委員會，援議具體辦法，提會討論。七月二日第十六次會議據該委員會提出報吿，所授訂辦法輕決議依照憲法第四十四條之規定，咨請總統召集有關各院長（監察院院長，立法院院長，司法院院長）會商解決監察院提出法律案問題。</p>
<p>（四）依照上項決議：本院當於七月三日咨請總統會照在案·</p>
<p>（五）七月三日本院接准立法院憲院議字第五八四號咨，以所送監察法軍案，經交由法制委員會審査報告，以依據新法規定，監察院向本院提出法律案，似無條文之根據，未便審査。當經提出本院（立法院）第十六次會議議決，照審査意見本案未便審査，同時本案已由本院毛委員翼虎等另案提出經決議交法制委員會審査紀錄在卷。又以所送監察院各委員會組織條例草案，經提出本院（立法院）第十六次會議決定：「本案由監察院提出」未有依據，改由本院（立法院）法制委員會委員提出，原咨退還」紀錄在卷，等因並附檢還原咨二件到院。</p>
<p>（二）監察院可提法律案之理由</p>
<p>（一）査憲法第五十八條第二項之規定：「行政院院長各部會首長須將提出於立法院之法律案，預算案，戒嚴案，大赦案，宣戰案，媾和案，條約案及其他重要事項，或涉及各部會共同關係之事項，提出於行政院會議議決之」，細考原文含義，並非爲規定行政院得向立法院提出法律案，而實係指出上列各案，應經行政院會議議決，爲一種提案必經之程序，此外對於該院提案問題，在憲法上更無可資援引之根據。</p>
<p>（二）又查憲法第七十一條規定：「立法院開會時關係院院長及各部會首畏得列席陳沭意見」條文中「關係院院長」五字，在制憲時，原草案中本為「行政院院長」，至二讀會時，史尚寬等三十四代表，依照議事規則第二十四條之規定，再提修正案，將「行政院院長」改為「關係院院長」。其理由爲：「考試院，司法院，監察院就其主管事項之法律案，關係院院長自得列席立法院陳述意見。」</p>
<p>此項修正案提出國民大會弟十五次會議討論，在塲代表一千四百人，以九百四十七票之贊成通過，可見當時制定第七十一條，改行政院院長爲關係院院長，實已認爲監察院可向立法院提出法律案。</p>
<p>憲法第八十七條有「考試院關於所黨事項，得向立法院提出法律案」之規定，因此發生立法院對監察院提案之疑義。然制憲時草案原文「考試院關於所掌事項，提出法律案時，由考試院秘書長出席立法院說明之」，似軍在規定由秘書長出席說明一語。其後因史尙寬等提議，不必規定秘書長出席，遂經修正爲本條。是本條文制定之初，實非單獨指出考試院可以提案，而他院則加以限制也。</p>
<p>世界各國立法通例，凡爲憲法所未規定，亦米禁止者，立法機關可以製訂法案　補憲典之疏路，在我國訓政時期約法，亦未規定各機關向立法院提案問題。但於國民政府組織法中，分別明確規定之，可見對立法院提案權，非必須規定於憲典，而憲法亦無　察院不得提案之消極限制。自可援各國通例，另行成立法案，傳監察院對所當事項，得提法律案於立法院。</p>

<p>〔合衆社華盛頓十日電〕民主黨全國代表大會將於十二日上午十一時三十分在費城揚幕，大會之主要任務，將爲提名總統及副總統候選人，通過黨綱，及採取全黨幸福有關之必要措施。此間民主黨全議委員會總部稱：雖然出席大會之代表將有一千五百九十六人及同樣人數之更警代表，但實際選舉總統及副總統候選人之票數則爲一千二百三十四票，獲得提名之必要多數將爲六百十八票。參加大會之代表包括四十八州之代表團，阿拉斯加及夏戚夷地方波爾多黎各島，哥倫比亞區，巴拿馬運河地帶，及維爾京羣島之代表國擁有多數選票之代表團包括：紐約州九十八票，本露凡尼亞州七十四票，伊利路斯州六十票，俄亥俄州五十票，加利福尼亞州五十四票，得撒州五十票，及密款根州四十二票，各州以外之代表國票數實力爲：阿拉斯加六票，夏威夷六票，哥倫比亞六票，波爾多黎各岛六票，巴拿馬運河地帶二票及維爾京羣島二票。</p>
<p>〔路透社華盛頓十一日電〕民主黨全國代表一千五百名定星期一在費城開會遴選十一月總統選舉之民主黨候選人，杜魯門雖爲黨內人士普遍不滿，但以黨內各主要派系尙不能同意其他候選人之提名，故杜魯門之當選爲總統候選人，殆可斷。，秉政垂十六年之民主黨，內部對內政外交之意見，已吿分裂，黨員不乏承認羅斯福所建立之政洽帝國，已遭破裂者，唯一可以團結黨內份子之人物，祇艾森豪成爾將軍一人，但艾氏已一再堅決表示，決不同意被提名爲總統候選人。民主黨在召開全代大會之前夕，雖進備提名杜魯門爲總統候選人，然其缺乏熟忱之態度，實爲美國總統競選史上所罕見。民主黨總統競選運動之戰略家，擬注重該黨之內政計劃及窮止種族歧視之政策，然關於後者南部諸州之民主黨份子，對改善黑人待遇之點，堅決表示反對。南部選民，大多爲民主黨之堅決擁護者，黑人祗許在全國之若干區投票，北部諸州之民主黨，則倚賴黑人選票之處甚多，尤其是伊里諾埃，本算文尼及紐約諸州，杜魯門之向國會提出保障黑人人權之法案，即爲爭取民主黨在北部諸州之選票，但南部民主黨已表示如果民主黨之總統競選運動以黑人待遇問題爲賭本，則南部民主黨不惜退出全代大會。此外左翼份子在華萊士領導之下脫離民主黨，亦使該黨實力大受打擊。據調査民主黨全國代表中，已表示將支援杜魯門者共得二百八十六人，彼等且謂尙可獲得其他三百五十四名代表之支持，渠爾不難獲得數六一八票半數爲多之選票而被提名爲民主黨之總統候選人。</p>

<p>〔合衆社費城十日電〕據十日之形勢，民主黨全國大會可能提名巴克萊爲副總統候選人，黨內大部份人仕亦轉而支持參院民主黨領袖巴克萊爲副總統候選人，參院民主黨政策委員會秘書已預測巴克萊必將被大會提名、</p>
<p>已克萊在南部及邊境諸州中早負盛譽，新政派雖然擁護最高法院法官陶格拉斯爲副總統候選人（如總統候選人提名失敗後〕，但陶格拉斯本人則已聲明拒絕參加任何提名。若干來自工業區各州之元老，則認爲巴克萊與陶格拉斯問爲適當人選。至於杜魯門之態度，雖未發表，但預料必將接受，因爲人權法案仍使黨內騷擾不安，許多人以爲：巴克萊之出馬，可能使南部民中黨員來歸</p>

<p>〔合衆社費城十日電〕反杜魯門代表十日開會討論，計劃在民主黨大會中提名某「自由份子」爲總統候選人，以「防止無異議提名」杜魯門。此「自由份子」可能係參議員裂伯。反杜魯門集團包括產業職工大會政治行動委員會，美國人民民主行動會及其他派系，內布拉斯加州民主黨主席李贏以被提名爲其領袖。渠對記者稱，來自二十州之代表四十至五十人集會討論，將於十日晚發表一「公認之自由進步之民主主義領袖」之姓名，大致將爲裝伯，渠亦出席會議，並表示如渠之競選由於「自由份子」之促請，渠將接受提名。</p>

<p>〔路透社倫敦十日電〕國務大臣兼外次麥克尼爾今日在朗福特之聯合國協會宴會中致辭，鄭重表示柏林事件，決非孤立事件，此乃各種糾紛集中之焦點。英國之處理柏林事件，當本其一貫原則，即各有合作之憲志，英國轉爲首先從事合作者，但讓步並非合作的替代品，故英國將決不從事進步。</p>
<p>在今日一天中，尙有其他若干內閣要員亦均公開談及柏林問聖。將於星期日飛柏林觀察空運情况之空軍大臣漢特森，亦在史得福郡之溫斯福發表演說，略謂，由於一國與他國之歧見，而使數百萬人民之人權及需要感為抵押品，誠屬可怖。蘇聯領袖茍能解除封鎖，而在會議桌上解決科紛，豈非一極有價號之重大實獸。園防大臣亞歷山大在諾丁澳鄂之寇克培發表演說，希望人人能認臘柏林局勢之危險性，在公理及自由原則未獲確立以前，永久和平殊無建立之可能。外次梅秀在諾維權發表演說，謂蘇聯欲將西方强國逐出柏林，柏林人民則切盼西方盟國留在柏林，蓋恐西方强國退出柏林以後，彼等將與其他共黨控制國內之反共份子，這這同一命運之故。</p>

<p>〔合衆社倫敎十一日電〕此間東歐外交觀察家稱，南斯拉夫狄托元帥之叛萊克林姆宮之共產情報局，業已使蘇聯加强準備正式成立全面之「東方開書」，以抵抗「西歐五國聯盟」。其方法則爲將目前東歐各園間所成立之「互助同盟」，併成一個反侵略世界賣本主義之「聯防」條約。東歐各外長上月在華沙開會，即爲蘇聯籌組「東方同盟」之第一步。據測，東歐各外長不久又將再度會議，以推行「東方同盟」計劃。</p>
<p>外交界又稱，蘇聯計劃之基本爲一緊密之軍事同盟，包括自動互助及軍力之密切配合，將簽字各國之軍隊置於蘇聯指揮下。東歐衛星國共有七十師，南斯拉夫實力最强，執戈者約五十萬人，然狄托旣公然抗拒共產情報局，蘇聯訂劃不唯遭阻或被推翻。東歐在此人士稱，狄托之變，使蘇聯益亟亟於在其帝國內部加緊聯繫，以防巴爾幹單獨成立同盟而離開莫斯科。蘇聯及其東歐衛星國業有錯綜之同盟及經濟協定系統，且除阿爾巴尼亞外，與全部東歐國家訂有互助協定，各國間大多數亦互締同盟，唯一缺陷厥爲南匈兩國。「東方同盟」之主要軍事經濟目的如次：軍事上，蘇聯圈內各國軍器標準化，蘇聯已着手於此；經濟上，加强經濟合作，且鼓勵蘇聯式之五年計劃。蘇聯旣握有東歐貿易之半數。</p>

<p>〔路透社艾賽克斯郡伍特福城十日電〕戰時首相邱吉爾今日在此間渠之選區內發表演說，嚴辭抨擊蘇聯之政策，並力誡政府勿得在柏林危機中屈服。渠云，「吾人仕此一嚴軍之問題中如果讓步，則將毁滅避免三次世界大戰之最好機會。須知蘇聯並非可以表現其自由意志之大國，其在克里姆林宮中之十三巨頭，自立爲勇敢的蘇聯人民之主人，以遠較任何沙皇爲更專制之獨裁手段統治蘇聯人民。無人能知此克里姆林宮中之十三巨頭，將做些什麽，彼等不若西方世界之可以理喻，其最主要的利益，在對數萬萬不同種族的人民，使用護腕以維義其個人權力。此一寡頭政治的內幕，雖非外界所得而知，就余所知，其內部已在個別行動甚至相反行動。否則如何能解釋正當柏林危機進入最高潮之際，尙有閑暇以驅逐南斯拉夫出其附庸國之集團。</p>
<h3 id="c60">共產國際情報局發表　譴責南斯拉夫聲明（續） <a href="#c60" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e60" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">60</a></h3>
<p>（原載「基督敎科學箴言報」美國新聞處譯）</p>
<p>共產情報局深信：南共的領導當局已將馬克斯·列寗主義關於黨的理論，加以修改。根據馬克斯·列寗主義的理論，當是全國領導的基本力量，有它個別的黨綱，與非黨員的大衆，不能混爲一談。黨是最高形式的組織，是勞工階級最重要的工具。但南斯拉夫却認爲領導力量的不是共黨而是人民陣綫。南國領袖低估了共黨的任務，而且事實上，讓兼溶解在人民陣綫中。人民陣綫包括了各種不同的階級：勞工，具有私人經濟勞動農民，富農，商人，小工廠主，布爾高亞，知識份子，以及各種政治集團，如若工資產階級的黨等。</p>
<p>南國的政治領袖頑固地否認它們觀念上的錯誤，它們認爲南共在人民陣綫中間，不能够也不應該有自己特殊的政綱。在南斯拉夫的政治舞合上，只有人民陣綫在活動，而共然及其種種組織並不在人民之前，用它自己的名字公開行動，這一事實不但减低了共黨在國家的政治經濟方面引起的作用，並且動搖了該黨作爲一個獨立政治勢力的地位。因爲一個獨立的政治擊力，才可以用公開的政治活動，公開的宣傳和它的政綱來爭取羣衆更大的信心，並且把更大的工作人民羣眾，吸引到它的勢力之下。南斯拉夫共黨的主要原則，導原於俄羅斯孟塞維克派的錯誤，這輩人是主張將馬克斯政黨解放，使它變成一個非政黨性質的羣衆組機。所有這些情形，證明有淸算南斯拉夫共黨的傾向。共產情報局認爲：南共中央委員會運種政策，危及共黨本身的生存，並且還含有南斯拉夫人民共和國衰落的危險。</p>
<p>（五）共產國際情報局認爲黨內的官僚政策，對於南斯拉夫共黨的生命和進步是有傷害。黨內並無民主，選舉原則並沒有實現，也沒有批評和自我批評。狄托和卡台爾治同志雖作種種口頭保證，可是南共中央委員會的人員、大部份都不是選舉出來的而是補缺選出的。事實上，共黨是合法的，共黨會議並不舉行，或者祇是秘密舉行，這一事實足以動搖該黨在羣衆中的勢力。這樣一個組織祗能稱之爲宗派——官僚政治的。它使一個活躍的和決定性的，有機體走向淸算的路上去。它在黨內實行軍事方法，猶如托洛斯基所實行的。在南斯拉夫共黨中，黨員的權利遭遇蹂躪，對黨的程序稍作批評，殘酷的報獲即隨之而來。這點必不能予以容忍。</p>
<p>共產國際情報局認爲這種可恥的純粹土耳其式的恐怖政權，在一個共黨中必不能讓它存在。爲了南共本身的存在和進步，我們要求結東這個政權。</p>
<p>（六）共產情報局認爲VKS（B）的中央委員會，以及對南共友好的其他共黨的中央委員會對南共中央委員會所作的批評，指出並科正已往所犯錯的一切必要條件，藉以恢復其領導地位。但是南斯拉夫共無領袖們，受了妄大狂的影響，並不誠實地接受這種批評，也不採取勇於改過的途徑，反而憎恨這種批評，採取敵對的立塲，並以反黨的精神絕對否認他們的過失，達反馬克斯——列寗的黨義，而調和他們反黨的錯誤。</p>
<p>當南國的領袖們證明他們不能辯正VKS（B）中委會和其他弟兄共黨中委會的批評時，他們更直接的去欺騙他們的黨和人民。他們把人家對他們的錯誤政策的批評，不讓憲和人民知道，他們並且把解決巨卓維治和希伯蘭兩位同志的實在原因，也保特着秘密。（按巨氏爲南國財長，希氏爲輕工業部長。）</p>
<p>南斯拉夫的領袖受了蘇聯共黨中委會和其他各友黨的批評之後，就企圖用命令來實行許多左傾的法律規條。他們怱忙地發出一些關於小工業興零賣商業國營化的命令，可是對國營化的實施並無準備。這些法令發布的忽遽，只能使南國人民生活必需品的供應更爲困難。同樣，他們又忽促地發布一項關於農人殺稅的新法令，這條法令事先也無適當準備，所以只足以使城市居民的糧食供應爲之解體。最後，他們又用堂皇的宣言，聲明他們對蘇聯的愛心和祟仰，可是人已知道，他們對蘇聯採取着惡海的政策。</p>
<p>南共領袖宣布一種清算南國資本主義份子的政策。一九四八年四月十三日，狄托和卡台爾治在致蘇共黨中委會的函件由寫道：「南共中委會政治局正努力淸除我國資本主義的遣跡」。</p>
<p>根據此種槪念，卡台爾治於四月廿一日在南斯拉夫聯邦人民共和國的人民議會中發表演說稱？「在我國，一切人對人的剝削都快完了」。南共領袖在南國的現狀下，採取這樣的路綫來淸算資本主義份子和富農階級，只能說是冒險性的和非馬克斯主義的。實際上，這種音量在南斯拉夫還不會得到解決，因爲，到現在個人經濟還普遍於全國，而個人經濟是必然要產生資本主義的。到現在實行集體農塲的條件，還沒有準備起來，大部份農人都還不明白集體經濟的好處。蘇共的經驗證明，只有以集體農場爲基礎，纔能淸算最後的又是最多的一個剝削階級，就是富農；而富農階級的淸算，又是實行集體農塲的主要工作。</p>
<p>要想，成功地淸算富農階級和國內一切資本主義份子，那麽當方面就須進行準備工作，以便限制資本主義份子，在工人階級的領導下聖固農工的聯合，並發展社會主義的工業。在這方面如果操之過急，只能招致不可補償的損失，只有在這些準備步驟謹愼實施之後，繼能從限制資本主義份子過渡到淸算資本主義份子。</p>
<p>南斯拉夫領袖想在衙門裏製造法令，以求匆促地解決這個問題，無論其目的何在，都不過表示他們在從事一種命定要失敗的冒險，不然就是一種在妄的居心叵測的宣言。共產情當局認爲，南國領袖這些左傾的往令和宣言的用意，是在拖飾他們的拒絕承認錯誤，和拒絕誠實地改正錯誤。（未完）</p>

<p>〔本報特寫〕物價不斷狂漲！軍警的鎭壓，倉庫的撿查，並沒有阻止汹湧的漲潮。這樣，便苦了薪水階級，尤其是職業女性。固然，樸實一點說，一件藍布旗袍也可以對付過去了，但是愛美原是女子的天性，尤其是在這男子中心的社會裏。</p>
<p>今天，一個職業女性拿到了薪水，已經談不到如何樣子去買些金鈔來維特幣値，她們月終的敵重課題，是怎樣在拿，到薪水以後，搶先一步奔到百貨店裏去搶購她們意於需要的東西。在會計處的一角，往往喧鬧得像打翻了鷄籠子：「莉珍，回頭你陪我去買管密絲佛陀唇膏。」「好的，我也要去買一雙尼隆絲襪，你知道再不買就要買不到了。」或是「裘莉，我原不想做夏天旗袍了，可是翻出箱子來一看呀，領子沒有一件高的。」「裁縫就會跟我們作對，還有皮鞋匠。」「瑪琍，我的頭髮都直了，今天非得去做一下不可。」</p>
<p>幾種價目　看了發呆</p>
<p>但是等她們急急忙忙奔到了百貨店，一張正在夥計手裏涂改的價目單，使她們嚇得目瞪口呆了：</p>
<p>54型尼隆絲襪　$15，000，000，—</p>
<p>密絲佛陀唇膏　$8，500，000，—</p>
<p>又　胭脂　$4，500，000，—</p>
<p>汕頭手帕　$5，000，000，—</p>
<p>夜巴黎香水　$10，000，000，—</p>
<p>美國綢衣料　$15，000，000，—</p>
<p>夥計說：「你們來晚了一步，早一個鎭頭就便宜得多了。」這些小姐，用稀有的謙和語氣對夥計說：「我們是老主顧，照老價錢好不好？」夥計苦笑着說：「這是老板叫改的，抱歉得很，不能通融！老板說：生活指數又漲了，價目怎麽能不改」。於是小姐們的計劃，預算，都破滅了。她們立在櫃台邊，楞得進又不是，出又不是，夥計便巧言引誘。「小姐，還是買了吧！到了明天說不定又得漲，物價是跟着美鈔走的。」明大，誰料得到明天會是怎麽一付局面？反正跌價總不會的，買了算了」</p>
<p>等到買了呢，踏出店門，少不得一陣惱恨，上個月的薪水還能買四雙51型尼隆絲襪，現在只剩三雙了。</p>
<p>那位頭髮直了的小姐，她原想去電燙一下的，一問價錢要三百萬元，她立刻改變主意，只讓理髪師做了一個頭，可也不便宜，一百四十萬，自然，修指甲的五十萬元已吿節約了。</p>
<p>追求手帕　不顧生命</p>
<p>現在的職業女性對於服飾不得不隨時加以硏究了，第一，星期一至星期五，輕易不穿上尼隆絲襪，反正夏令光腿也還算得時髦。同樣的日期，玻璃紗與美國綢的旗袍也得省省，好在英製花布粗看上去也還上眼，此外玻璃提包以及白皮鞋當然採用乙等貨。到了週末，因爲大都有點應酬，這才動用了全副一九四八年的最新配備。</p>
<p>穿上最新配備走上交際塲合，它們的價値時常在提醒她們小心翼翼，別靠三輪車的背墊，別讓車蓬上的油漬沾汚了你的旗袍！可是，糟！越是小心越是糟！突的括了一陣旋風，把手中的一方雙面刺繼的汕頭手帕給吹走了。想起它們的價値幾合美金一元，她連忙不顧一切的跳下車來追。這一下把路人嚇呆了，不覺脫口而出：「喂！車子！」原來一輛迪沙多汽車正在她的身邊擦過，眞是好險！她却一點也不覺得，因爲神經緊張了，全神賞注在失落的手帕上。一直等拾到了，臉上才透着點兒笑容。</p>
<p>有了家累　更不必說</p>
<p>舞塲上一度流行過的「急撲舞」，現在已經被小姐們逐步厭棄了，倒不是怕犧牲涔涔香汗，而是因爲它的動作大而劇烈，很容易使玻璃絲機破損。在目今破一雙尼隆絲襪對小姐是個嚴重的威脅，就算萬幸抽絲面積不大，可是一筆織補費，畢竟是意外損失啊！</p>
<p>至於已經做了媽媽的職業女性呢，她的容光更是黯淡了。她說：我的蓓蓓病了，嚴了一瓶10MG維他命B，就是六百萬，我的先生被裁，到現在還只能帮我消耗戶口米！</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕上海文藝作家協會，昨日下午四時，假座南京西路馬霍路口大觀社鴻圖廳，舉行第六三次文藝座談會，出席作家王進珊·嚴獨鶴·施翀鵬·陸丹林等數十人，該會理事長潘公展親臨主持，會中介紹名考古家兼發明家陳公哲所設計之「袖珍拼合印刷字母」。陳氏對於文字學甚有研究，因感我國文字太爲繁複，缺點甚多，乃着手加以整理，發現大部份文字均可分析爲若干基本字母所拼合，因此普通常用字一萬字可减少至基本字母四百至二千字。惟如基本字母僅四百字，則拼合若干繁複之字時往往須四拼至七拼，不够簡單。如基本字母有兩千字，雖拼數可少而字數仍嫌太多，因此陳氏定一千字爲基本字母，由此可拼成任何常用中國文字，在應用時平均每一百文字中，六十字即爲原來字母，不需拼合，三十八字須由兩字母拼成，尙有二字由三字母拼成，如此並無不便或費時之弊。</p>
<p>長短闊狹　字母不一</p>
<p>此種字母用於印刷時，用木塊刻成，因字母形狀長短闊狹不一，拼成之字大小稍有參差（如圖所示）。但陳氏認爲不足爲病，蓋西洋文字亦有長短闊狹之別也。字母木塊之形狀大小，分爲（一）方形字長四公厘闊四公厘，（二）長方形長四公厘闊二·六六公厘，（三）狹字長四公厘闊一。三三公厘，（四）扁字長二公厘闊四公厘，（五）特別扁字長一公厘闊四公厘，（六）小方塊字長二公厘闊二·六六公厘，（七）直角字長五·三三公厘，闊四公厘。凡備有此一千個字母每種各二十個，已足够供一小型印刷舖印刷文件書報之用。</p>
<p>推廣文化　功用極大</p>
<p>陳氏並另設計一斜形木盤裝製字母，以四角號碼分類，檢取甚爲便利，而其而積重量較用普通，鉛字者可减少百分之九十四，且所費甚廉，携帶方便，若能應用於鄉鎭或小城市，對於推廣文化必具極大之功用。除此之外，陳氏並擬將拼合字母應用於識字敎育方面，以收事半功倍之效，現正進行編成韻文敎材，此一工作希望文藝作家協助完成</p>
<p>古稀名醫　講教授法</p>
<p>年己七十五之名醫丁福保昨亦出席該會，渠對於中國文學硏究亦頗有心得，認爲現時小學敎員之敎授法太爲枯燥陳腐，不知用趣味性之分析引起兒童興趣，例如以識字而論，「王」字可解釋作三劃是天地人，中間一豎則通天地人者即爲王，又如「雨」字，上面一劃是天，曲形是雲，中間一緊爲樹，兩旁四點即是雨點，併成即爲雨字。若能如此講解，必能使兒童深記於心云。在塲名作家對於丁氏之意見均甚感興趣，而對其白首童心，尤感欽佩，座談會乃於笑聲中盡歡而散。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕本市近出現一提倡節育運動之中國侵生節育協進會，主持人爲一年已五十餘之孫嚴予女醫師，前昨兩日該會並在靑年會作公開演講四次，呼籲市民應深刻體認優生節育問題之重要。孫醫師認為「性行為」在各國已受普遍重視，而在我國似仍帶神秘色彩，始終乏人作有系統之研究與討論，因之常造成花柳病普遍猖獗工人，文化界，勞動階級，又因生活淸苦，無力生育，萊嬰事件數見不鮮，凡此皆小而影響家庭幸福，大則破壞整個社會民族之道德。故渠願以中國之「山額夫人」自勵，決針對目前此一嚴重社會病態，積極闡釋「性生活」之眞諦，並從而推進優生節育工作。據該會總幹事盧洪表示，該會之主旨，現已取得本市衛生局及醫藥界熱烈贊助。渠等第一步計劃擬先在本市區內創辦一「優生節育中心指導站」，俾儘量接受各界之質詢，討論，與批判，兼請解各種避孕方法之理論與技術。孫聲師昨晚並已晋京分向各有關當局陳述意見，希望政府能以最大力量支援此一工作之推動。該會揭　之標語中有謂：「主動生育兒女之父母，才是眞正神聖父母！偶然無意之生育是罪孽！」等項。聞係根據國際節育協會原則所厘定。該會强調人口無限增加乃文化落後之徵象，渠等並引證美國聯邦法律對優生節育之規定，希望我國亦能在消極慈罰墮胎罪行之刑律外，增訂獎勵節育法則一種，俾使此由「性行爲」紛擾而生病態之社會，能早日康復。</p>

<h3 id="c82">本年度全國棉田　三千九百餘萬畝　存棉估計逾二十二萬萬市擔 <a href="#c82" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e82" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">82</a></h3>
<p>農林部棉產改進諮詢委員會曁全國棉紡織業聯合會，十一日聯合公佈三十七年度全國棉田估計及全國存棉計如下：</p>
<p>全國棉田　所增無多</p>
<p>（一）三十七年全國棉田估計：　此次估計：（一）根據冀·魯·晋·豫·素·蘇·浙·皖·贛·鄂·湘及蜀十二省調査估計報吿而製成，（二）以本年五月底情形爲標準。</p>
<p>本年軍要棉區之十二省，計有棉田三九，五二五千市畝，較上年度最後報吿三七，七七七千市畝，（上年全國棉田三八，八六一千畝內隴·滇·閩·遼等省計一，〇八四千畝並計在內），僅多一百七十餘萬市畝，增數無多，此與國內治安頗有密切之關係，若分省比較，除山東省增數較多·河北·陜西及江蘇亦稍有增加，餘均不及去年。江蘇省方面，京滬區棉田增多·蘇北則反是，此亦足微治安與棉田多寡之影響。</p>
<p>匪域調查　無法進行</p>
<p>匪禍區域調査工作未能順利進行，如豫省實地調査者，僅豫東·豫西及豫中之一部份產區，餘均將輾轉詢問，估計山西省亦然。江蘇省之沭陽·阜稱·臨城等縣，河北省之武城·南皮等縣，陝西省之韓城·白水等縣，安徽省之阜陽。鳳臺等縣，威以情形特殊，或以交通遭阻，均以估計或通信調査完成。湖南省方面，亦有若干產區，因兩阻未能遍歴普査。</p>
<p>本年棉田調査，早經着手，期望早日發表，無如匪亂未已，或以郵電有阻，音信難通，或在戰火之中，無法進行工作，雖多方設法克服，猶未符合理想。</p>
<p>烽火遍野　工作艱難</p>
<p>（二）三十七年第一次全國存棉估計：</p>
<p>此項估計（一）以本年五月底情形爲準，（二）本年估計以棉農存棉爲主，兼計及一部份商行販戶之存棉，（三）河北省當地棉農有存儲子棉之習慣，故本篇分記其數，江蘇省奉賢等少數棉區，亦存有少量子棉，同照實記之。估計河北，山東，河南，陜西，湖北，湖南，江西，安徽，江蘇，浙江各省，合計二，二四一，四六六千市担。</p>
<p>存棉估計雖　始於去年，然今年猶在草創之中，工作艱難，加之條火遍野，進行旣多阻碍，棉晨商行復多顧忌，報道離詳。即就本年估計言，河北省及江蘇省之紀錄，尙能差强人意，然猶有若干縣分無法査估商行或棉販之存花，他如山東省僅査及齊東臨靑等二十一縣，河南省豫東各縣及燕賓等二十八縣，陜西省咸陽興平等廿九縣，湖南省之濱湖十二縣，安徽省懷寗東流等二十縣之存棉，餘均缺如，雖非全豹，然已盡最大之努力。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕上月廿八日，滬東西湖路永安第一紗廠失竊金城牌細布二件，計八十疋，比至翌晨由厰方發覺後，即據情報吿楊樹浦警分局，經王分局長飭刑事股長季秉權着手偵査，已於前日捕獲該廠工人邱永寬，涉有重大嫌疑，當即帶局偵訊，始供出行竊不諱，並謂尙有其他三工人，夥同行竊。經續派警士四出偵査，果將同黨三人一併拘獲，均供認屬實。前日有警員數名，押同邱犯至該廠現塲表演行竊經過，不意甫至二層樓至三樓之問，該犯乘警員不備時，竟蹤身跳樓長罪自殺，當塲跌斷有骨，傷勢沉重，嗣經人載送公濟醫院施治無效，延至昨日中午老死。事後警局方面將屍體界送常德路驗屍所候驗，案卷申送地檢處核辦。</p>

<h3 id="c87">楚人文化遺跡發現　長沙古物出土記（完） <a href="#c87" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e87" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">87</a></h3>
<p>— 蔣玄佁</p>
<p>〔本報長沙一日航訊〕機物在長沙出土很多，保存的却非常少。計有鞋二三只，包劍及包裏羽　的政絹數量很多，全爲土佚業去，我存有幾塊。又掘出細絹畫一塊，上寫文字及奇異圖書者，（僅一塊）原跡由一美人以千元押金向某古物商借去，至今尙未收回。這一件戰國的文書，可算得是件國實，應由國家設法去收回才是。此絹底文書，原蔽一篾盒中，有厚厚的一疊，可揭開聖看的，祗有一塊，絹地細密。</p>
<p>怪物圖案尚待考證</p>
<p>絹底文書邊上的圖案，有角首人身，三首一身等「山海經」上的怪物，有待考證的地方很多，在這當中的七八百字的文章中，大體是說：『山川四青赤帝靑帝之類』，而他的第一句開頭，即日『畋』，這個字在字典上是沒有的，祗有『玉海類編』上有一款字，方言謂「楚人問吉凶也」。从這一件文書，我確確實實證明了道些出土物是楚人的文化。至於這一篇文書，單字就有八十多個，雖然他的篆法與壽縣太子鼎銘文相同，可是不能釋譯的字多得很，此處無法備述。</p>
<p>鋼鏡出土　秦歟楚歟</p>
<p>銅器之中，唯一美麗的是銅鏡，因爲銅鏡是個人用品，所以特別做得精巧，大約也算是市人弄器之一。楚人銅器的特徵，第一是薄，第二是川形紐，第三是當有怪奇的禽獸與植物花紋。這種銅鏡最早在壽縣出土，其次在洛陽，外國人名之曰秦鏡，又說是司克坦文化傳入中國的產物，但我在長沙親手收得卅餘件不同的銅鏡，目見出土的，則在三百件以上，而他的花紋，與漆器的花紋，頗多相同處，似不妨名之日楚鏡。</p>
<p>諸般石器　鼎壺杯盤</p>
<p>石器的質地是滑石，有鼎·壺·杯·盤等等形式。琥珀質的，是一只獅子，一只鴨。玻璃很多，以鑲嵌的大珠爲最美麗。瑪瑙水晶，出土的也很多，以無花紋，我就感不到興趣而犧牲了。火漆的是一對手鐲，當時不知是什麽質，經仔細觀察，才知是松香的，說文上有一個「玟」字，就是這種質地。古玉出土有數百件，但形式極少變化。金銀的，則爲印軍，戒子，或版狀物。</p>
<p>其中關於陶的明器，漢代的爲黃色綠色，楚基中則爲黑色，或黑色底加漆繪花。又泥版一種上有「郢稱」二字，國人均釋爲「郢寺」「郢爰」，我收的，卻明明白白是「郢稱」。</p>
<p>民族藝術　集中研究</p>
<p>爲了有機曾收集這些楚品，我感到集古器最好是有系統，容易明白某一民族的風俗藝術，而古器物的花紋，實在比文字更重要，文字容易受政治力量統一，花紋則爲民俗的，不易受異族的變化。中國在漢以前的文化史，實在各區不同，所以分區的研究，比唐·虞·夏·商·周的分代研究更有趣。至於這些楚器的準確年代的推斷，祗有希望來一次有計劃的發掘，或者由考古學的同好來共同收集，使材料集中，以便作比較的研究。現在雖然長沙區域中發掘出來的古物已少見了，而奇異物品，却有不少還留在古物商的手中，但再過些時候，道批文化史上的珍貴材料，說不定會有向外國全部流出的可能。</p>

<p>— 本報記者　趙展</p>
<p>〔本報潘陽八日航訊〕自潘陽與關內陸路交通斷絕，淪爲塞外孤岛以來，人口即大量南流，在空中飛的人數，約佔在陸地上爬者的十分之三。瀋市三月份人口一百一十三萬人，四月份人口一百一十二萬二千人，五月份人口九十九萬三千人，六月份人口九十九萬六千人，一月比一月少了，惟六月較五月多出三千人，可能是難民增加所致。這是淸陽有史以來的人口大疏散。最近空運加强了，在鐵翼蔽空的情形之下，一般人才覺悟到茫茫異鄉，逃往那裏？又躊躕不前了，這一切都像一塲混亂的夢。現在大家不再爲飛機票焦急，發愁的是空運處，飛機空着回去，是一筆很大的損失，相反地，是北平到潘陽竟難於上靑天了，聽說黑票都很難買到。</p>

<p>爲生活所壓泊百殺的事，幾乎日有所聞。這兒試舉自殺者二例：（一）小東街四段廿一號小販王紳，五十七歲，天天豆餅總吃不飽，深感厭世，於六月廿六我，乘妻女熟陲之際，投入水缸內淹死了。塔灣區輔仁街三巷二號，住戶趙連舉，家貧斷炊，一病而亡，遣妻（廿八歲）及一子，死後無錢買棺，憂憤之餘，於六月廿四日服毒身死。</p>
<p>七月五日，東北物調局宣佈公敎人員的眷屬停止配糧，彷彿晴天霹靂，辦公廳中就有人大發牢騷：「政府還要不要公務員，最好是請楊妹來辦公吧。」</p>
<p>挑選特警　維持治安</p>
<p>隨着物價飛揚起來的，是盜刧案的增加。根據市府發表數字；六月份發生盜案卅六件，刧案七件，搶案一件，但査閱五月份的統計就很驚人了，强盜案三〇件，竊盜案一八〇件，殺人案十件，我相信這個統計是較爲完整而正確的。六月份中兇殺的案件實際上是比五月增加了，足以說明社會的不景氣，不安定。爲維持治安計，警察局在各區挑選特約警察二萬一千三百八十五名，專爲蒐集情報。</p>
<p>在日漸冷落的瀋陽，唯一擁擠的塲面是電車上，很多雜兵，靠他們的手臂和勇氣，吊在電車的外面，由市區疾馳而過，不但有碍觀瞻，確也使人担心。每日有卅二輛電車奔波，每日乘客平均有九萬二千人，其中不購票者佔四分之一。</p>
<p>市示範區　強化市政</p>
<p>此外，應介紹一個城市示範區，以窺市政一斑。這個示範區中推行的政治如下：（一）規定商店住戶設置衛生水桶，以防塵土飛錫。（二）各保指定垃圾塲，每日運走新生垃圾。（三）修繕公共厠所五處，市民稱便。（四）種植行道樹一千四百株。（五）創辦婦女兒實識字班四處。（六）召開戶長會議，解釋區政方針。（七）訪問入營兵家族。（八）敎區民唱「保衛東北歌」。（九）强化市民合作社。（十）舉辦赤貧生活調査。其結果是頗堪矚目的。</p>

<h3 id="c99">一般物價　週末銀根鬆濫　漲風勢力如燎原 <a href="#c99" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e99" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">99</a></h3>
<p>六月漲風後，市編好像經過暴風急雨的洗刷，雨過天靑，自然會有暫時的寧靜。但六七月的天氣是不正常的，所以市塲在短期的沉寂後，又有蠢蠢欲動的模樣了。</p>
<p>上選市塲動態，因爲在猛漲後，當局照例有一番嚴密的管制，如檢査倉庫，監督市塲，傳詢投機操縱份子等，在這種情形下，行市多未做開，尤以棉紗糧食等交易爲甚。但物價的走勢，却在高峯盤旋前進，穩中帶俏。及至週末，似又呈直綫性上升的趨勢。上週銀根頗現鬆弛之狀，國家行局交換情形，迭有差出，但暗息仍高，約在四角至四角五分間走動，大概這是由於人們對物價仍在看漲的關係，所以不願輕易把頭寸拆出</p>
<p>國營事業曁公用事業於六月漲風後，上週紛紛調整新價：（一）七月九日起，全國各鐵路客貨逐價調整，計客運漲百分之九十，貨運漲百分之一百五十。（二）本市水電煤氣，於七月四日起調整新價，計水漲百分之一七五，煤氣漲百分之一七一。（三）七月九日起，公用交通事業調整新價，計電車漲百分之一百五十六，公共汽車平均漲百分之一百五十六，小型鐵路漲百分之一百三十，輪渡平均漲百分之一百七十。總之，這是一個漲的環境，有人說政府也在那兒領導漲價。</p>
<p>國家行局放款利息，上週經四聯總處核定仍採差別利率制，並訂定計算辦法如下：</p>
<p>甲，各行局承做各類放款，照下列等級分別計息</p>
<p>（一）國策貸款：月息八分五厘，（合掛牌市息三分之一。）</p>
<p>（二）業務貸款：分下列三種：（一）出口及交通公用事集月息一角五分，（合掛脾市息百分之六十。（二）工礦生產事業月息一角八分，（合掛牌市息百分之七十。）（三）民生日用必需品運銷事萊月息二角，（合掛牌市息百分之八十。）以上所計各級利率，仍應按照所合成份隨時比照掛牌市息調整。</p>
<p>乙，各行局庫向中央銀行辦理抵押重貼現及轉押匯，照下列規定計算利率及折扣：</p>
<p>（一）利率：（一）國策貸款較原放利率減少月息二分五厘。（二）業務貸款：A出口及交通公用事業貸款較原放利率减少月息一分五厘，B工礦生產事業貸款，較原放利率减少月息一分。C民生日用必需品運銷事業貸款，仍照原於利率計算。</p>
<p>（二）折扣：（一）國策貨款。八折。（二）業務貸款：七折。　按最近中央銀行掛牌重貼現息爲每千元八元，合月息大二分四，一年以十二個月複利計算，本利之和約增加十三倍。高物價率是高利率必然的後果，但是在物價如此超出常態的跳躍之下，政府如何又能不提高利率，所以在協助增產與平抑物價的兩大前提下，當局利率政策的決定，確是應當深深考慮的。</p>
<p>千呼萬喚的美援問題，已於本月三日由我國王外長，及美國司徒雷登大使，分別代表中美政府簽字，至此已吿一初涉段落了。我們根據王外長的說明，美援得來亦非易事，中國在責任方而至少應員有下列幾點：</p>
<p>（一）美援款項其中一小部份，用於特種建設事業者，將來或須另議價還辦法，其餘　爲贈與性質</p>
<p>（二）中國政府承允减少貿易陣碍，增進對外商業關係等。</p>
<p>（三）美方保有隨時停止援助之權。由此看來，美援也多少帶有點無條件的條件。據估計美援價値，可彌補當前每月財政赤字二分之一以上，我們不否認美援穩定經濟的重要性，如何善爲運用，這是當局挽救目前經濟危機的一個大關鍵。</p>
<p>上週商品市塲走勢，週初因當局管制過嚴，頗少做開，游資無出路，竄入股市，以致週初迭登漲限，新價屢見，週中較爲沉寂，週末因銀根鬆濫，又趨興感。</p>
<p>紗布市塲，週初頗少做開，週末漲風再起，四十二支藍鳳週五曾高站十九憶，龍頭細布破四千萬大關。</p>
<p>糧食中塲因當局於四日規定食米限價爲一千六百萬，七日調整爲二千萬，塲內交易甚少，堪外喊價有直叩三千萬大關之勢，油粉亦齊步趨漲，如週末菜油豆價約五六千萬，兵船一號粉喊八百九十萬新高價。日用品如香姻肥皂火柴等，略有起伏，但週末三一致回升。餘如金屬化學品建築材料等類，均在高峯之上，盤旋前進。</p>

<p>（一）銀根暗息</p>
<p>上週本市銀根，就市塲而論，業外比業內緊俏，就每日而論，午前又比午後緊俏，如就一週趨勢說，銀根則漸漸自緊俏轉爲鬆弛。</p>
<p>業外銀根之所以緊俏，由於貨幣不斷搜求單子而供源亦欠在之故。業內則因六底以後，舊欠甫吿經淸，新放尙未做開，致頭寸普吿鬆和。至於銀根所以午後較午前鬆和，良以午後受外埠匯款潤澤之故。再因上週國家行局反入爲出，而外埠遊資，又續吿抵達，致週四週五之本市銀根已漸見轉鬆。</p>
<p>說到現鈔籌碼，一週來普見短細，其原因不外：第一物價掛高，流通籌碼相形缺少；第二，自余管局禁止行莊缺額申請轉脹後，不敷頭寸，行莊每設法以現鈔抵補。致交換時輒感現鈔籌碼不足；第三，國家行局現鈔庫存瀕竭，支付時每感厭如，致發行大鈔之傳說，又盛傳一時。</p>
<p>暗息方面，這半月以來已普見上升，昔三角六分之高息，一般而論，已升爲四角左右，最高且有四角半者，利率之上揚，可謂係貨幣貶値物價飛漲的必然結果。</p>
<p>上週國家行局交換結果，反進爲出，自週五至週一，計共差出一萬六千四百八十八億，如扣除商業銀行之定存共二三千億，則行局之實際差出，當有二萬億之譜。上週有一顯著現象，即央行之同業定存大見减少，這乃受行莊同業拆放率迭見提高，超過同業存息之影響。</p>
<p>外商銀行自週一至週五，計共差進二萬九千三百五十一億。</p>
<p>商業行莊，銀根大致平和，週三以前，同業拆放頗甚，週三以後，拆放轉見减少，業內週轉甚便，六十號以後行莊交換結果，自週一至週五共差出三萬九千五百二十六億，其趨勢則自週二以後，逐見减少，由此亦可見銀根轉弛之一般。</p>
<p>（二）內外匯率</p>
<p>上週外匯行市，結果證明，波動不大，週一在二百萬左右，邁二週三一度跌至一百九十多，週四五則又稍升至二百零七萬。惟結匯證出售期限已自七天改爲三十夭。香港申匯大致爲十萬法幣合港幣一角三四分，香港美鈔市價爲五元三角七分，黃金每華兩自三百十五元七角半升至三百二十一元二角半。</p>
<p>上週內應匯率，波動不定，穗匯匯水週一爲四百元，週二至週四落至三百五十元，週五又增爲四百元，廈門匯水週一週三週四皆爲四百五十元，週五竟高挺至六百元，資金之流轉，當甚劇烈，渝匯匯水，週一爲五十元，後迭降爲十元，週五又回至五十元。漢匯匯水則續見升高，週一爲一百元，週五已累升至二百八十元。津匯貼水除週二爲二十元外，餘均爲五十元。</p>
<p>（三）華洋股市</p>
<p>週初華股市塲，因當局敵厲抑平物價，紗布及糧食等市塲，交易無法做開，各帮游資，無由宜洩，大有萬流歸宗，灌入股市之勢，永紗又有召開股東會消息，晨開即以六千三百三十元漲停板，他股亦以投資踴躍，大都漲停。是日午後，永紗即喊六六二三漲停，人心看好，造成滿堂紅局面。</p>
<p>週二游資仍源源湧入，永紗又以六九六五元漲停，市况煥發，計有二十種漲停，未登漲限者，僅五種而已。</p>
<p>待至週三，因已連漲兩日，人心居高思危，獲利有售，永紗雖曾一度創見七二〇〇元新高價，終歸平淡，全市盤旋參差，永紗僅較上日微升三十五元，他股跌多漲少。</p>
<p>週四市況，勢仍參差，人心持觀望態度，新力不繼，舊多逐售，乃又績降，績跌者達十四種之多，永紗微升，晚收爲七一二〇　週五因匯款湧至，供源暢旺，銀根奇鬆，外象物資各升日二三成不等，股市亦見輝煌，再現滿堂紅，永紗較昨升七一〇元，成交數創七五億萬股新紀錄，足見游費流入股市之踴躍。</p>
<p>週末晨開，又吿滿堂紅，如火如荼，人心奇佳，計一週來之股市，竟見三次滿堂紅，爲歷來所未有。考其原因，當屬戰事影響，通貨太多，各方游資，多來本市，各物襯漲，而股市本年來所漲倍數，較其他物資爲小，更以本週當局限制其他物資市價，遂使久勢之股市，飛揚暴騰，一漲再漲矣！</p>
<p>洋股市塲，上週因受當局管制，無法做開，故從缺。</p>

<p>再看中等學校情形更為明顯光復前一年，國民學校畢業生升學的百分比，只有百分之八·三九；民國三十五年增到百分之二二·一四，三十六年增到百分之三三·五九。初中畢業升到高中的，光復以前沒有初中，無法估計；光復以後也是一年年地增加；卅五年增加到百分之四六·五一，卅六年增加到六六·六六。再就中等學校學生數比較，光復時期僅有四二一〇一人，本年度已有八四六三〇人，已增一倍有奇</p>
<p>高等教育</p>
<p>至於高等教育，日人對於本省青年在省內升入專科以上學校限制之數，無以復加；據光復前一年（民國卅三年）的統計，本省專科以上學校學生共有二七五一人，而本省籍的只有五百四十八；其中文理科的僅五人。光復以後，民國卅五年全省專料以上學生已增至三一二九人，其中本省籍的達二五四二人。由此觀之，本省敎育情形前途尙可樂觀。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕跑馬廳英海軍棒球聯賽大勢，已因週末中華之兩捷與美空軍之失去長勝銜而改觀。中華以五戰四勝，與　標呼聲最高之空軍並踞首席，冠軍當不出此兩隊。美海軍實力尙稱雄勁，爲唯一能予中華及空軍以威脅之隊伍，自膾以下，均已與錦標絕緣。聯賽最近形勢如下：</p>
<p>美軍攻勢猛烈</p>
<p>中華隊昨日一秉前數戰作風，先衰後盛，雖二度瀕於敗殆危機，仍能把持最後機會，以一分之微，壓倒美陸軍。中華以新陣應戰，美軍先攻，左翼倍爾根與中堅毛利下馬施威，運拔二等。第三局又見倍兩根重展故智，藉鮑氏之安全打，再添一分，成三對零。中華急整軍容，以兪長鑾出任投手，梁友聲退居游擊原位，梁友文守三壘，鮑觀文退休，毛利再蹈陳倉舊道，擬偸本壘，曹克家洞來其奸，妙手刺殺，陸軍攻勢漸遏。</p>
<p>中華打開悶局</p>
<p>第四局中華反攻，盧兆森得自由壘後，偸至二壘，曹克家妙擊左野，兆森再進一步，兪長鑾自我犧牲，送兆森返防，爲中華打開悶局。</p>
<p>六七兩局，友聲·友文各得一分，扳成三三平手。第八局美軍游學珊奧藉司壘裁判之錯誤判決而獲一分，美軍又再領前。觀衆咸爲中華危，幸諸將沉着應戰，盧兆森於吶喊助陣聲中，舊臂一擊，球如矢發，直飛右野，竟爲市華獲致成軍以來之第一次全壘打，四比四又成平手。</p>
<p>獲得最後勝利</p>
<p>最後一局，勝負所繫，中華緊守，運殺三將，先保不敗。反攻時何金本得自由壘，更籍友文友聲之巧紗烜打進至三壘，迨觀達操棒，抵球學向左場，金本衝歸，遂爲中華獲得最後勝利。各局戰績如下：</p>
<p>又前日業餘以十二比十一勝巡邏，昨午空軍苦戰九局，以〇比一慘遭海軍軍手。</p>

<h3 id="c119">美國大選內幕 <a href="#c119" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e119" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">119</a></h3>
<p>— 雨窗</p>
<p>美國有一句俗語，叫作「出錢的大爺點戲」（He　who　poys　the　pipercalls　the　lune），意思是：你旣然用了人家的錢，你就應該聽人家的話。這句俗語用在政界尤其適合。因此，美國每四年舉行一次大選時，總統候選人競選費用的來源總是大家諱莫如深的。</p>
<p>美國總統候選人競選的費用是一筆相當可觀的數字。僅管競選人的宗旨如何堂　，語氣如何動人，要是大家根本無從聽到他的演說，他的競選總是枉然。若要使選民能够聽到你的競選演說，你就處處非用錢不可。譬如說，上次競選的時候，羅斯福廣播了一篇「爐邊談話」，這筆廣播費用就是十萬美元。共和黨在最後關頭曾在各電合做嚴播廣吿，單單在一個州就用掉了七千元。今年的費用自然比四年前又要貴得多。全美國大槪有六千萬有選舉權的公民，你祗要每一個選民處寄一份印刷的宣傳品，每封信的郵費一分半，六千萬封信單單郵費一項就要九十萬元，再加印刷費·紙張·人工，總數就要三百萬了。</p>
<p>美國議會爲限制競選費用，曾經通過一個「海區法案」，規定任何「政治團體」每年動用款項不得超過三百萬元，但大家還是陽奉陰遠，民主黨宣稱在一九四四年選舉時用掉二百十六萬元，共和黨說祗用了二百八十二萬元，可是據惠爾士來大學女敎授歐佛拉克博士的調査，兩黨都曾巧立名目，成立了許多與本黨大同小異的團體，協助競選，所以事實上那年羅斯福和杜魯門競選費用達七百四十四萬，共和黨杜威和勃里格在那年也用掉了一千三百萬元。據歐佛拉克敎授估計，今年兩黨競選費用的總數須在五千萬元左右。</p>
<p>這些錢是那裏來的呢？</p>
<p>在羅斯福參加競選以前，民主共和兩黨的競選費用都是由美國財力最濃厚的豪門和他們所控制的大公司付出來的，往往同一公司會付出兩筆差不多的錢，一筆給民主黨，一筆給共和黨，所以兩黨的競選經費常常無甚上下。但是到一九三六年羅斯福競選的時候，豪門對他所號召的新政頗表不滿，所以給民主黨的錢就大爲减少。到一九四〇和一九四四年維斯福二次繼續競選時，豪門差不多以全力支持共和黨了。</p>
<p>根據上文提起過的「海區法案」，每一公民或法人捐助競選費用不得超過五千元，但是，歐佛拉克敎授說，熱心助選的人門想出了巧妙的規避的方法，他們化整爲零，事實上毫未受到影響。例如著名的軍火商杜邦（Dupont）就曾以六十個族人分別捐助的名義，捐給共和黨二十萬元。庇岛（Pew）捐助十六萬四千五百元，却用了十二個人的名字。孟賽多化學品公司的大老板崑尼（Queeny）就以三個人的名義捐了五萬五千元。</p>
<p>民主黨却不然了，據調査，他們沒有從同一家族得到過一萬元以上的捐款。</p>
<p>在一九二八年時，民主黨全部競選費用的半數都靠一百三十五個熱心助選的人供給，這一百三十五人中每人捐款五千元以上，有三筆捐款超過十萬元。同年，共和黨方面，有三百多人捐款各在五千元以上，這些人中大中是銀行家，大廠商。民主黨從與一來源得到了百分之四十以上的競選費用。到一九四四年，情形大變，共和黨得到銀行家的捐款佔全數百分之十六·七；民主黨所得祇全數百分之五·二。工商界捐給共和黨的競選費用佔全數百分之二十四·二；給民主黨的祗佔百分之八·一。</p>
<p>民主黨競選費甩的一個大來源是工會。一九三六年，銀行家和工業家都不肯支特民主黨，工會却出來起而代之，捐助了民主黨競選費用總額的百分之十；到一九四〇年，工會的捐款又增加到百分之十五·九。在一九四四年，工會方面主持捐款助選的「政治行動委員會」曾捐出一筆一百三十二萬餘元的款子，相當引起了政界的波動。</p>
<p>大體說來，共和黨靠美國的「六十豪門」帮忙，而民主黨却靠工會撑腰；但兩黨也極力想自收入較菲的人民們募捐，一九三六年，共和黨向一千七百萬選民呼翻，請各捐一元助選，結果收到四十萬元，但必要的另星開銷部用掉了十六萬元左右；民主黨捐到了一百萬元，除掉開銷便打了個八折。</p>
<p>歐佛拉克敎授說，人民們普遍地捐助競選費用是一個很好的現象，可惜到今日爲止，還沒有發揮出最大的力量。要自由就須付代價，否則，「出錢的大益點戲」，政府就不能不多顧全一點富豪們的利益了。</p>

<p>像小孩子們帶着興奮的情緒，期待翁過新年一樣的，隨着各校的舉行畢業典禮以後，學生們迎搖着這一年一度暑假的來臨。</p>
<p>離開九月上旬的開學，還有整整的兩個月，可是今夏不比往年，我想大多數的同學都有異樣沉重的心情。而本屆畢業的學生們忙於找尋職業，「暑假」更無憲義可言，今後除「爲人師」以外，不可能再會有暑假的享受了。</p>
<p>所以，我們這些行將舉業的學生們，對於這最後的幾個暑假未免珍惜起來，也不禁而興遲暮之感了，這滋味眞與長大的孩子不喜新年差不多。</p>
<p>還記得小學時代的幾個暑假，都是渾渾噩噩中，漫不經意地溜了過去。一進中學，恰値抗戰軍興，孤島上的人民遭受苦難的時期，年齒日增，智識漸高，我們也開始體念到父母張羅學費匪易，每逢暑假，從父母的額上看出了他們的煩惱和憂慮，做孩子的除了靜靜的做「暑期作業」外，那有閒情逸致來度假期呢？抗戰勝利，我們這幸運的一羣，滿以爲從此步入坦途，走完學業全程較易，又誰料今日橫梗在我們心頭的問題，依舊是鉅額的學雜費？</p>
<p>我們一面爲本屆舉業的同學「改消費爲生產」而欣幸，我們更爲在學的同學們行將失學而悲哀。我們不忍見一校初生的嫩芽，失去灌溉而夭折，我們聲香祝禱本報的讀者助學運動，得以早日圓滿完成！</p>

<p>因此，在書業不振的前提下，白報紙的銷路理該减少，然而依舊那末貴者，想必有許多報紙都到了非出版業的手中去了。結果出版業嫌紙張及印工等太貴，裏足不前，眞正愛讀書者，也以書報定價過高，無力購買。於是報紙愈漲，出版業與讀者之間的那垜繼，也愈築愈高。而書業的不景氣，似乎更成爲確切不易的事實了。</p>
<p>這種現象，有沒有什麼補救的辦法呢？我想是有的。一是由讀者自己來辦文化事業，以减少讀者與出版業之間的鴻溝。二是由當局對於眞正獻身出版業者，優先配給報紙。這樣一來，或可解決紙荒問題，而供應平價的精神食糧吧。</p>

<p>車價一直向上漲，使人簡直行不得。</p>
<p>據說是汽油價高，因而車價要漲，公共的車輛自應在漲價之列，其理由本來已很顯然。可是試一想之，私人的汽車如此之多，私人的享受在今日是否未免太過？何不多漲他們一些價，藉以貼補公共的車輛，以期能帮助大多數買不起汽車而又必需坐車的人？</p>
<p>再退一步想，外來的汽油貴，何以不多開採國內的油碼？本國的煉油成本高，何以不利用汽油的代用品？記得在抗戰期中，使用過不少的酒精車和木炭車，如今何以不能再利用？如果是爲了漂亮，那麼便不能再說艱苦，如果是爲了想减少麻煩，那麽便不必再談研究。德之，在目前，辦法未始沒有，只怕不肯去尋一</p>

<p>成都與北平</p>
<p>戰時，局居西南後方，每至成都，輒生「此亦北平」之感。時賢好稱成都爲「小北平一，吾則以爲不然。</p>
<p>以史獻之年輩言，成都不在北平下，不必言張儀築城，即檢視史記貨殖列傳，當日成都，固已爲經濟與文化之巨邑矣，其時北平，殆猶偶然一上谷小郡耳。後來數百年，經過公孫述劉備諸人之建都，成都循序發展，至唐代而繁榮爛熟，達於極點，最佳之證，乃在薛　。現代治史者每調：就某一時代之奴院生活史料，以推斷其時其地之文化生活與經濟生活之豐嗇程度，往往有驗，然則執史獻上關於薛濤之種種記載，豈尙不足爲當日成都繁榮之說明乎？北平至金元而始有建築規型，至永樂而始稱備文物，雖曰後來居上，顧以此而遂「小」視成都，是爲歷史失序，吾竊以爲未可。</p>
<p>成都何以似北平？其實亦僅爲乍見者之一時直覺，非必有科學之考驗。成都在淸時，爲將軍駐防區，若干旗人結居其地，無論飲食，語言，儀節，聲樂，服飾，建築等等，共生活習慣逐漸滲入居民問，成都人茹受之旣久，消化之復遇，故運至民國三十餘年之後，猶有流風餘緒可尋，如是而已，卑之無甚高論也。</p>
<p>若言氣候，則北平槃　高煥，天無濕雲，純然剛美，與成都已深沉窈軟，多雨而蒸，豐然有異，惟其爲自然之寵兒則一，荒皆能滋潤花木，榮寧果蔬，在成都，見巡槍瓦雀，啄食葡萄，了不避人，輒思及北平，——如是而已，亦卑之無甚高論也。</p>

<h3 id="e1">Tightening Currency to Stabilize Finances: The Government Decides to Release Large Quantities of Goods; Ministry of Finance Plans to Formulate Measures to Expedite Disposal at Adjusted Prices <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Office, 11th Dispatch] To tighten the currency and stabilize finances, the government has decided to continue selling goods it controls. It is estimated that a large amount of US surplus goods, enemy and puppet goods, and Japanese reparations goods will be sold in the second half of the year.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Office, 11th Dispatch] According to sources, regarding the annual income for the second half of the year, in addition to the ordinary tax revenue for which the Ministry of Finance has drafted reorganization and adjustment plans and is awaiting the Legislative Yuan's completion of the legislative process for implementation, the Ministry of Finance is also actively planning to continue selling US military surplus goods, enemy and puppet goods, and Japanese reparations goods. It is estimated that the sale of surplus goods and lend-lease materials can reach over 1,570,000 billion yuan, the sale of seized enemy and puppet properties and goods can reach 100,000 billion yuan, and the sale of Japanese reparations goods can reach 37,500 billion yuan. The Ministry of Finance has drafted measures to expedite the disposal of the aforementioned goods at adjusted prices and will urge the responsible agencies to step up processing and remit the proceeds to the national treasury.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Office, 11th Dispatch] The settlement of payments for US military surplus goods and lend-lease materials purchased by China during the war will soon be carried out. The bill from the United States has been sent to our country, and the relevant Chinese authorities are separately studying and calculating it. A meeting will be convened in the next few days to discuss settlement methods. It is reported that the settlement will be based on the condition that the goods have indeed arrived in our country and that our side has receipts.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Office, 11th Dispatch] The agreement and annexes on economic assistance between China and the United States and the exchange of notes on trade in the West German and Hong Kong areas (i.e., the Sino-US bilateral agreement and its annexes and exchange of notes), after being signed and announced in Beijing on the 3rd of this month by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs based on the Legislative Yuan's acceptance of aid and authorization to sign the agreement, were submitted to the Legislative Yuan by the Executive Yuan a day earlier for review and record. As this agreement and exchange of notes are administrative in nature and do not require review and approval, the Legislative Yuan's Procedure Committee has listed the Executive Yuan's message as a reporting matter and will present it at the regular meeting on the 13th.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 10th Dispatch] Hoffman announced that the Economic Cooperation Administration has approved the purchase of materials to aid Europe and China for $26,616,750. So far, the amount of aid to China totals $27,788,300, of which $2,147,260 is used to purchase wheat and flour, $12,620,040 to purchase rice, $13 million to purchase cotton, and the remaining $1,112,100 is for shipping needs.</p>
<h3 id="e2">Legislative Yuan's Committee Reviews Overall Budget in Groups: Preliminary Work Completed; Directorate-General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics Submits Plan to Reform System <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Office, 11th Dispatch] The Legislative Yuan continued to hold committee review meetings throughout the 11th. Except for the First Group, which was closed on Sundays, the remaining six groups gathered separately to secretly discuss the budgets of various government departments. It is reported that the Sixth Group has completed the review of the budget under the Ministry of Social Affairs, and the budget under the Ministry of Education is only awaiting a decision. The Seventh Group has also largely completed the review of the budget under the Ministry of Communications and the Ministry of Food. The work of the remaining groups has completed six or seven tenths. The budget committee decided that the seven groups would continue to meet on the 12th so that the preliminary group review could be completed on schedule; otherwise, the agenda would be postponed. The staff of the budget committee have been extremely busy these days. More than 50 staff members, led by Chief Secretary Wen Shourin, have been mobilized to work day and night, which is very hard work.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Office, 11th Dispatch] The Directorate-General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics previously attached a policy plan to the budget for the second half of the year in accordance with the law. Of the six articles in the outline, three are related to system reform and the division of powers and responsibilities between the central and local governments. The main points are as follows: A. Re-establish the management system for local accounting personnel. The main points are as follows: (1) County-level key personnel are all appointed positions. Regardless of whether they are principals or assistants, their appointment, removal, transfer, and adjustment are handled by the provincial accounting agencies and implemented by the provincial government's orders. (2) The appointment, removal, transfer, and adjustment of provincial-level accounting personnel who are currently recommended positions are handled by the provincial accounting office; those who are simplified positions are handled by the Directorate-General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics. (3) The appointment, removal, transfer, and adjustment of accounting personnel in municipalities directly under the Executive Yuan are handled in accordance with provincial-level examples, while accounting personnel in provincial-administered cities are handled in accordance with county-level examples. B. Adjust the organizational system of local accounting agencies. The main points are as follows: (1) As a principle, one accounting organization should be established for one agency. (2) If two organizations with equal rank were originally established, they should be merged and reorganized. If the ranks are unequal, the organization with the lower rank should be reorganized under the organization with the higher rank. (3) The accounting organizations within each agency should be named according to the organizational structure of each unit within the agency, with the word "accounting" prefixed. C. Revise the laws and regulations for local governments in provinces, cities, and counties to handle budgets. The budget law amended and promulgated in May of this year did not stipulate the procedures and powers for the compilation and review of local budgets in provinces, cities, and counties, and the methods implemented in the past are very different from the situation after the implementation of the constitution. It should be revised as soon as possible as a basis for handling the budget for the second half of the year. The principles of revision are as follows: (1) The county local budget should be discussed and decided by the county legislative body and implemented by the county government under the supervision of the provincial government. (2) The provincial local budget should be discussed and decided by the provincial legislative body and implemented by the provincial government under the supervision of the central government. (3) If the budget of a lower-level government involves the financial revenue and expenditure of a higher-level government, it should be approved by the higher-level government.</p>

<p>[Our Nanjing Office, 11th Dispatch] The Kuomintang Central Political Committee is scheduled to hold a regular meeting on the 12th. It is reported that the candidates for the two ministers of the Examination Yuan, namely the Minister of Examinations and the Minister of Personnel, will be submitted for discussion at the meeting. It has now been learned that the Minister of Examinations is Tian Jiongjin, and the Minister of Personnel is Shen Honglie.</p>
<h3 id="e4">Many Tourists in Kuling <a href="#e4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>Citizens Hope President and Wife Will Visit</p>
<p>[Our Kuling Office, 11th Dispatch] The number of tourists in Kuling is increasing daily, but because flights have been suspended for a week and there are not many boat trips, most tourists come from the Zhejiang-Jiangxi and Nanxun lines. The reporter recently completed a 42-hour journey, passing through the Shanghai-Hangzhou, Zhejiang-Jiangxi, and Nanxun lines, and arrived in the Kuling urban area at 6:30 pm on the 10th. The Kuling city is very orderly, but there are many foreigners. The local citizens are eagerly hoping that the President and his wife will visit soon. The Jiangxi Daily reported on the 10th that the President will visit Kuling soon, which made the citizens very happy.</p>
<p>[Our Kuling Office, 11th Dispatch] Traveling to and from Shanghai and Kuling has been greatly facilitated by the dispatch of personnel from China Travel Service in various places. However, it was observed along the way that both Zhejiang and Jiangxi provinces suffered from floods in the spring and summer. Rice fields submerged in water could be seen at any time on both sides of the railway, especially along the Nanxun line. Some rice fields could be traveled by boat, and three or five farmhouses became isolated islands. In Jiujiang, the water level of Gan Tang Lake rose, and boats could travel everywhere in the urban area, which made people deeply feel the severity of the floods.</p>
<h3 id="e5">Presidential Decree <a href="#e5" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c5" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">5</a></h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 11th Dispatch] President issued the following order on the 11th: (1) Appointing Hui Yuanfeng as a member of the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission, and Qiu Yuanrong, Yun Zhuting, and Guo Meicheng as acting members of the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission. (2) Appointing Li Binghan as Counselor of the Embassy in Myanmar.</p>
<p>[Another Dispatch] President issued the following order on the 11th: Xu Chunlin, the county magistrate of Jiahe County, Hebei, led a team to defend against bandits and was loyal to his duty to defend the territory. He was firm in his will and did not avoid danger. He was tragically killed when the city fell, which is very regrettable. He should be commended by decree to commend his loyalty and righteousness.</p>

<p>[Our Nanjing Office, 11th Dispatch] On Air Force Day, August 14, the Air Force Headquarters and its subordinate units will hold grand celebrations. The Air Force Headquarters is scheduled to hold a celebration ceremony and medal presentation ceremony at the headquarters on the morning of that day. In the afternoon, a reception will be held at the Xinsheng Society to entertain leaders from all walks of life and foreign guests. All officers of the department will also hold a variety show in the evening to help.</p>
<h3 id="e7">Many Legislators Propose Strict Investigation of Funds Fleeing Abroad <a href="#e7" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c7" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">7</a></h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Office, 11th Dispatch] Legislators Huang Tong, Fang Zhichao, Yu Zheng, Liu Chucai, Gan Jiaxiang, and twelve others recently proposed that the government be requested to negotiate with friendly countries as soon as possible to strictly investigate funds fleeing abroad so that citizens can fulfill their tax obligations. The opinion of the Legislative Yuan's Procedure Committee on the case is to transfer it to the Foreign Affairs Committee to jointly review it with the Finance and Economics Committee.</p>
<h3 id="e8">Whether Legislators' Proposal to Promulgate Amnesty Can Be Submitted Is Not Clearly Defined; Procedure Committee Lists the Case as a Reporting Matter <a href="#e8" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c8" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">8</a></h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Office, 11th Dispatch] Legislators Duanmu Jie and 31 others recently proposed that the government be requested to promulgate an amnesty. However, the opinion of the Procedure Committee of the Yuan is that "According to Article 58 of the Constitution, amnesty cases are proposed by the Executive Yuan after deliberation. Article 63 stipulates that the Legislative Yuan has the power to decide on amnesty. Furthermore, Article 15 of the Legislative Yuan's Organizational Law only stipulates the submission of legislative proposals by legislators. As for whether amnesty cases can be submitted, there are no explicit provisions, which seems to await interpretation by the Judicial Yuan." Therefore, the case has been listed as a reporting matter and will be presented at the meeting on the 13th. The proposed measures in the case include: (1) The target of the amnesty is limited to those who committed crimes before the President's inauguration on May 20 of this year. (2) Those whose most severe sentence is imprisonment of a fixed term or less shall be granted amnesty. Those whose most severe sentence is death or life imprisonment shall have their sentences reduced by one-half (reporter's note: the original case is like this, but how to calculate it is really a question). (3) War criminals, traitors, corrupt officials, those who murdered their parents, and drug offenders shall not be granted amnesty or reduction. However, as the question of whether the Legislative Yuan can submit an amnesty case has already raised the question of legal interpretation, this matter is unlikely to be resolved in the short term.</p>
<h3 id="e9">Control Yuan Holds General Meeting This Morning to Discuss Resumption of Meetings and Exercise of Consent Rights; President Hosts All Control Yuan Members This Afternoon <a href="#e9" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c9" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">9</a></h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Office, 11th Dispatch] The Control Yuan held a meeting of all members at 9:00 a.m. on the 11th, convened by President Yu. In addition to President Yu's report on the results of the meeting convened by the President on the 10th to discuss the issue of the Control Yuan's proposal of laws, after discussion by all members, it was decided that a general meeting would be held at 9:00 a.m. on the 12th to discuss the resumption of meetings and the exercise of consent rights. The adjournment of the Control Yuan ended on the 10th. At the meeting on the morning of the 11th, Secretary-General Li Chongshi reported that the list of grand justices and examination members nominated by the President had been sent for a long time and urgently needed the Yuan's consent. Secondly, the President had scheduled a tea party at the Presidential Residence from 5:00 p.m. to 5:30 p.m. on the 12th to entertain all members of the Control Yuan. After Mr. Li's report, President Yu reported on the process and results of the meeting at the Presidential Palace on the 10th and reported on the opinions of the Control Yuan, the Judicial Yuan, and the Secretariat of the Presidential Palace. Then, the members spoke. Liang Shangdong believed that if we immediately resume the meeting, exercise the right of consent, and produce grand justices, the responsibility of the grand justices lies in interpreting the Constitution. However, the Control Yuan's proposal of laws is not found in the scope of the law, and the grand justices may have no basis for interpretation. Therefore, the emergence of grand justices will not help matters. However, Mr. Liang stated that he was not opposed to the resumption of meetings. Many people then spoke. Hu Wenhui and others believed that if the recess lasted for a long time, human and material resources would be insufficient, and the outside world would not understand the Yuan. Because we have very high salaries and enjoy good benefits, the daily cost of automobiles is over 10 million yuan, and each meeting day increases the government's burden. Therefore, it was proposed that the meeting be resumed immediately. De Xuan also said: In the midst of the intense war in the Central Plains and soaring prices, the Yuan should resume the meeting first. At the same time, he proposed that all members of the Yuan donate one or three days' income to comfort the soldiers at the front. However, at the same time, some people believed that after the adjournment of the Yuan, a resolution to resume the meeting could not be made at the talk meeting, and an extraordinary meeting could not be held during the adjournment. However, because the majority advocated resumption of the meeting, a final decision was reached at 11:30 a.m. The discussion will take place at the general meeting on the morning of the 12th. (The opinions of the Judicial and Control Yuans on the issue of proposing laws are published on page 2)</p>

<p>Expressing Attitude Towards July 5th Incident</p>
<p>[Our Beiping Office, 11th Dispatch] Legislators Zhao Shixi, Liu Bokun, Liu Shengban, Li Jiwu, Zhou Muwen, and Bao Yimin, who are from the Northeast and are residing in Beiping, issued a statement on the 10th regarding the "July 5th" incident, stating: (1) The Security Bureau should face the consequences of the "July 5th" incident squarely and should not hesitate to push the student movement as the essence of the enemy. Since the authorities cannot prove that the dead and injured were all communists, they must take the blame and be sincere in holding those involved accountable for manslaughter. Glossing over and whitewashing will only increase the complexity of the situation's development. (2) The goals of the "July 5th" movement were originally very simple, but the resulting tragedy and the blood of our youth are exactly the temperature that the Communist Party can exploit. It is hoped that the youth of the same hometown will take strict steps. (3) The incident was caused by the resolution of the Beiping City Council. It is hoped that the City Council will remain silent. The undersigned absolutely disagree with the City Council's statement on the 10th. Strictly speaking, Beiping City is the Beiping of the whole country, and it has never been heard that anyone has emphasized the regionality of Beiping City.</p>
<p>Director of Beiping Education Bureau Advocates Sanctioning Those Who Fired the First Shot</p>
<p>[Our Beiping Office, 11th Dispatch] Wang Jigao, Director of the Beiping Education Bureau, explained the process of handling relief for students from the Northeast at a press conference, saying: He firmly believes that the people of North China have absolutely no psychological discrimination against the people of the Northeast as accused by the outside world. The occurrence of the unfortunate "July 5th" incident was due to insufficient coordination among all parties beforehand. Mr. Wang said: "My position is not high, and it doesn't matter whether I do it or not. I don't have to lie. To be honest, the final unfortunate incident was unexpected. The person who fired the first shot should be sanctioned by law."</p>

Once an application is made, it will be returned immediately. If the property of our domestic people was seized and taken to French territory during the war, they can fill out an application form in accordance with the regulations, together with supporting documents, and apply to the Government Compensation Committee for transfer and return.</p>

<h3 id="e27">Pay Attention to British Construction of the India-Tibet Highway! <a href="#e27" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c27" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">27</a></h3>
<p>As China is being exhausted, its national defense and border security are also under threat. Geographically, the Northeast has changed color, the new districts are unstable, the Yunnan-Burma and Yunnan-Vietnam borders are disputed, and alarming news has come from Tibet and Xikang. According to recent reports, Britain is actively constructing a highway on our Kang border, directly connecting to the Indian province of Assam, a place called Guidi. Our central and local authorities are closely monitoring the construction and are engaging in negotiations with British India. The Indian Ambassador to China has stated that there is no such thing, but the truth remains to be concretely proven. This matter greatly concerns our western border defense. If it is true, we should lodge a strong protest with British India and take effective measures through diplomatic and domestic channels to stop Britain's illegal road construction across the border.</p>
<p>Xikang is our western border region, and its position is important. Thousands of years of history have shown that turmoil in Kang and Tibet not only affects the safety of Sichuan, Yunnan, and Qinghai provinces, but also influences historical changes. In the past, to govern the borders, it was necessary to secure and stabilize Kang and Tibet. Due to the inappropriate border policies of the Manchu Qing dynasty and the westward encroachment of British imperial power, the Tibet issue became increasingly complex and serious, almost being swept away by the British Empire. The 12th Dalai Lama's forty-year rule in Tibet was consistently pro-British and anti-Han. If it were not for the success of the National Revolution and the central government's enlightened tolerance towards Tibet, Tibet would have likely already gone down the path of independence. When the Dalai Lama passed away in the 22nd year of the Republic, the Regent Reting Rinpoche, one of the four great Hutuktu, took over the regency, and the situation in Tibet rapidly improved. Reting reversed the Dalai Lama's actions, enthusiastically supporting the central government's war of resistance and reducing the troops threatening the Kang border. The Tibetan people loved Reting and supported his inward-looking policies, but unfortunately, the government was too busy to assist in the west, missing the opportunity to properly resolve the Tibet issue. In the 31st year of the Republic, Reting retired, handing over the regency to his teacher, Taktra, agreeing to hand over political power in two years. Last year, Reting was murdered, and 5,000 lamas from the Sera Monastery, one of the three major monasteries, were annihilated by Taktra. After this major political and religious change, Tibetan politics was completely controlled by the pro-British faction, reversing Reting's actions and even attempting to establish "diplomatic" relations with Britain, Japan, and the United States in an independent capacity. This can be seen in the independent activities of the Tibetan delegation at the Pan-Asian Conference held in India last year, and the recent visit of the Tibetan trade delegation to the United States.</p>
<p>The British construction of the Kang-Tibet highway is not a recent event, but began after the Tibetan coup last year. It is regrettable that the diplomatic and domestic authorities did not pay attention and take effective steps to stop its development, leading to the increasingly serious situation today. On August 27th of last year, this newspaper's Chongqing dispatch stated: Regarding the British construction of highways in Metok, Zayu, Bomi, and other places on the Kang-Tibet border, the Chongqing Pacification Headquarters had ordered the Kang and Yunnan provinces to pay close attention and collect evidence for strong negotiations. The Yunnan Provincial Government further ordered the special commissioners of the area to instruct the neighboring Detchen, Huangshan, Fugong, Bijiang, and Lushui administrative bureaus to conduct thorough investigations and reports. It has recently been confirmed that the highway starting from Sadiya has not yet reached Zayu. Recently, it has continued northward from Walong, about a hundred li southwest of Zayu, and is expected to be completed by the end of the 37th year of the Republic. The British and Tibetans have an agreement that allows merchants to transport firearms and daily necessities from Sadiya every year. After this project is completed to Zayu, it will extend northward from Sang'ang (Liao Mai) in the northeast to Wesidu (Bing Mu Duo), and another branch via Bomi and Tai Zhao can reach Arandhamy, connecting to India. At the India-Tibet border, British Indian military officers are stationed, and large stones are erected, engraved with British, Chinese, Indian, and other characters. The Chinese characters read, "Isn't it a pleasure to have friends coming from afar?" Also, according to news in May of this year, the India-Tibet highway has been built to Gexibu. If there are no obstacles, it can be built to Sikang by the end of this year.</p>
<p>Based on continuous reports over the past year and official reports, the British construction of the India-Tibet highway seems to be not only a verified fact, but also an attempt of great significance. This foreign force's penetration into Kang and Tibet, connecting the transportation routes of the high mountains and ridges of India, Kang, and Tibet, cannot be explained by the reason of facilitating trade. The threat to the security of Sichuan, Yunnan, Qinghai, and Kang is unimaginable. We should lodge a strong protest with British India and effectively prevent the construction of the India-Tibet highway.</p>
<p>Tibet is a local region of our country. The British signing a road construction contract with our local autonomous government is an act against public law and harmful to our national sovereignty. This measure is detrimental to the relationship between China and Britain in terms of both treaties and the development of friendly relations. We protest against Britain's measures that harm our territorial sovereignty and hope that the enlightened British government will stop these unfriendly actions to avoid escalating disputes.</p>
<p>Finally, we want to call the attention of the central government: In order to ensure national defense and border stability, we should adopt an active border policy to prevent foreign factors and seek self-preservation; implement thorough domestic reforms to promote the political and economic progress of the border regions, leading to social customs, ethnic cultures, and exchanges to the greatest extent possible, gradually moving towards the great goal of the Chinese family. Only with this kind of effort can we ensure the borders and prevent division!</p>

<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 11th] President Chiang sent a telegram on the 11th to the Suppression of Rebellion and National Reconstruction Mobilization Committee. The original telegram reads as follows: Chairman Sun of the Suppression of Rebellion and National Reconstruction Mobilization Committee and all committee members: Since our country returned from the victory of the War of Resistance, we could have strengthened ourselves in a timely manner, engaged in reproduction and education, and gradually promoted various construction projects, becoming prosperous and sharing benefits. However, due to the Communist Party's rebellion and wanton destruction, the areas affected by the adverse atmosphere have been devastated, and the people have been poisoned, resulting in the sudden suppression of national construction work. In order to lay the foundation for social stability and relieve the suffering of the people, the government has had to engage in suppression and quickly seek to eliminate the rebellion. However, military operations still depend on the mutual use of politics. Therefore, we have especially invited talents from all over the country to form the Suppression of Rebellion and National Reconstruction Mobilization Committee to concentrate will and work together. Now, at the time of its organization and establishment, it is also the time of active progress in the suppression of rebellion. Each committee member has either a reputation in the local area or has contributed to the country. It is hoped that everyone will work together, continue to serve the country, and, regarding the matters that should be promoted for the suppression of rebellion and national reconstruction, promptly start work in their original place of origin or place of employment, assist the local government in promoting everything, and arouse the local people to exert mass power, so that suppressing the rebellion is the foundation for building the country, and construction is the way to suppress the rebellion. In short, we hope that politics and military, the people and the government, will go to the same goal, achieve success together, and the future of the country truly relies on it. Chiang Kai-shek.</p>

<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 11th] Sun Ke, Chairman of the Suppression of Rebellion and National Reconstruction Mobilization Committee, held a tea party at the National Assembly Hall at 4:00 PM on the 11th to greet the appointed members of the committee. After Sun Ke explained the organization and scope of business of the committee (speech to follow), Gu Zhenggang of the Ministry of Social Affairs, Peng Zhaoxian, Minister of Interior, Jiang Yuntian, representative of the Democratic Socialist Party, and others delivered speeches. Minister Gu stated: The Suppression of Rebellion and National Reconstruction Committee is composed of talents from all over the country. Today, the bandit rebellion is serious, and it is still not enough for the whole country to work hard to suppress the rebellion. Now that the Suppression of Rebellion and National Reconstruction Mobilization Committee has been established, it should lead the people of the whole country, following the eight slogans of the War of Resistance period - national supremacy, ethnic supremacy, victory first, military first, concentration of will, concentration of power, contributing money if you have money, contributing effort if you have effort - to work hard for suppressing bandits and quelling the rebellion. Minister Peng, in his speech, particularly emphasized that if we want to win the suppression of bandits and quelling the rebellion today, we must make the best use of people's talents and the best use of the land's resources. Organizing and training the people is a matter of urgency. Each member of the Suppression of Rebellion and National Reconstruction Committee should put more effort into this when returning to their hometowns in the future. Jiang Yuntian, in his speech, said that those in charge should have power if they can exert strength in everything. When the Suppression of Rebellion Committee makes efforts in suppressing the rebellion and national reconstruction, the government should give it full power. Finally, all the attending committee members unanimously passed a resolution to (1) send a telegram to President Chiang to express respect, (2) send a telegram to the officers and soldiers in eastern Henan to express respect, and (3) send a telegram to the soldiers and civilians of the whole country to work together and strengthen the work of suppressing the rebellion.</p>

<p>[Our Correspondent, Nanjing, 11th] A fire broke out at the National Assembly Hall on the morning of the 11th.

The entire structure of the new building is mostly made of wood and cardboard, originally intended only for temporary use.

<h3 id="e40">Martial Law in Zhanjiang City, Guangdong Province: Bandit Attack on Central and Bank of China Repelled; Guangzhou Pacification Headquarters Decides to Strengthen Pacification Forces in the Southern Route <a href="#e40" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c40" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">40</a></h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent, Guangzhou, 11th] It is learned that at 3:00 AM on the 10th, hundreds of bandits infiltrated Zhanjiang City from the Jiayamu, Linggang, Xiyingqiao, and Cunjinqiao roads, looting the Central Bank and the Bank of China and attacking the military and police organs. After the military police teams fought fiercely for more than five hours, all the bandits were finally defeated, and the remnants fled towards Suixi. The bandits used the name "Second Detachment of the Guangdong-Guangxi Border Area People's Liberation Army," led by bandit leaders Wen Zhuohua, Zhang Qiang, and Lu Jing. It is judged that the bandit action was of a looting and disruptive nature because they only attacked the Chikan commercial district and did not dare to directly attack the Xiying district, the administrative center. It is rumored that the Central Bank lost 30-40 billion yuan, but the bank claimed that there were no significant losses. Qiang Fusen, the director of a certain central agency stationed in Zhanjiang, and his servant were killed in the melee. Zhang Ruigui, the commander-in-chief of the Guangdong-Guangxi Southern District, and Mayor Zhang Zhongjiang immediately held an emergency meeting at noon to determine a plan to defend the city and pursue the bandits and announced martial law that evening. Currently, telegraph and telephone communications between Guangzhou and Zhanjiang are still normal. Also, the Guangzhou Pacification Headquarters has now decided to increase the tenth administrative district to strengthen the pacification forces in the Zhanjiang area of the southern route and will appoint Zhang Junsong as the commander.</p>

<h3 id="e43">Luo Qinghua Discusses Property Tax <a href="#e43" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c43" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">43</a></h3>
<p>[Nanjing News] Legislator Luo Qinghua told reporters: The provisional property tax draft is intended to "find the person through the property." The capital of wealthy families has long been evaded overseas. The initial special relief donation was intended to "find money through the person," that is, "ordering the wealthy families to donate." However, Mr. Liu Butong, who is now supervising the special relief donation, says, "The wealth of the rich is either invested in profit-making businesses or used to purchase land." In this case, the wealth of wealthy families has not been evaded. Mr. Liu's past calls from the Political Council to the Legislative Yuan to "confiscate the deposits of Chinese citizens in the United States" have all become empty talk. It is remembered that at the beginning of the victory, the machine industry in the Great Rear Area had voluntarily and collectively donated factory property, requesting the government to take over all technicians. Currently, more than a thousand machine factories in Shanghai are also on the verge of being unable to maintain their operations. The machine industry is the mother of industry, and its decline to this point is imaginable. The best estimate for the current agricultural, industrial, and commercial sectors is "having property but no wealth." If property is the primary target of the tax, the result will be nothing more than "increased harassment and no benefit to the national treasury." We must thoroughly ensure that those who truly have money contribute, and that the president has the power to enact laws and raise funds for suppressing the rebellion, allocating public bonds for suppressing the rebellion to the wealthy. As long as the government is determined, the number of wealthy families can be counted on one's fingers, and there is no need to harm the innocent, causing national unrest. The name of property tax, although still novel and pleasing to the ear in our country and can stimulate people's hearts, still requires careful consideration of the advantages and disadvantages and should not be tried lightly. It is expected that this case will be properly resolved in the Legislative Yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e44">Proposing Legal Bills: Both the Judicial and Supervisory Yuans Should Have the Right; the Constitutional Omission Should be Resolved Through Consultation, the Judicial Yuan Argues <a href="#e44" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c44" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">44</a></h3>
<p>Judicial Yuan's Opinion</p>
<p>[Our newspaper's Nanjing Dispatch, 11th] Regarding the issue of whether the Supervisory Yuan can submit legal bills to the Legislative Yuan, the Judicial Yuan has presented its opinion to the Presidential Office for joint consultation. President Yu also reported it at the Tanpin (Discussion) Meeting held on the 1st. Su Huiwen (reporter) reports as follows:</p>
<p>Regarding the different texts of the Sixth Army, a situation report has occurred. If the text stipulates that two things have occurred, according to the practices of various countries, they should be resolved by the agencies with the authority to interpret laws, and the resolution should be regarded as a final decision until the constitution is amended.</p>
<p>The difference in opinions between the Legislative Yuan and the Supervisory Yuan this time is because the constitution does not explicitly stipulate that the Supervisory Yuan can submit legal bills to the Legislative Yuan (regarding the Executive Yuan and the Examination Yuan, there are provisions in Articles 58 and 87). This type of problem originally belongs to the interpretation of the constitution, but our country's constitution has another provision in Article 44 for disputes between Yuans, as follows:</p>
<p>For disputes between Yuans, unless otherwise provided by the constitution, the President may convene the heads of the relevant Yuans for consultation and resolution. The above article refers to consultation rather than meetings, and it actually has the meaning of mediation. It is to communicate the different opinions between the Yuans and bring them into agreement. However, the method of its resolution is not to force the minority to obey the majority (refer to the explanation of Article 45 in the draft of the Constitution of the Republic of China). During consultation, if the opinions of both parties are consistent, the relevant Yuans will convene meetings (the Judicial Yuan does not have a Yuan meeting but a Grand Justices Meeting) to make a resolution, which will serve as the basis for implementation. If the opinions of both parties cannot be reconciled, it will be necessary to interpret the constitution to make a decision.</p>
<p>As for the question of whether the President can submit legal bills to the Legislative Yuan on matters within his authority, it seems appropriate to study it at the same time so that there is a basis for application when needed.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Article 69 of the Fifth Five-Year Constitution Draft clearly stipulates: "The Executive, Judicial, Examination, and Supervisory Yuans may submit proposals to the Legislative Yuan regarding matters under their jurisdiction." The explanation of this article believes that "in countries with the separation of powers, if the government cannot submit proposals to the meeting, there will often be problems of incompatibility. In the Five-Power Constitution, although the five Yuans independently exercise their powers, there are still many connections between them. Moreover, the Executive, Judicial, Examination, and Supervisory Yuans know the matters under their jurisdiction most thoroughly and should be allowed to submit proposals to the Legislative Yuan." The reasoning is very correct. The coordination meeting advocated the Wang Cabinet system, so at first, the power to submit proposals was exclusively given to the Executive Yuan. Later, because the responsible cabinet system was adopted, and at that time, some people argued that the Examination Yuan might have the right to submit laws to the Legislative Yuan on all matters, the final draft specifically confined this power to the Examination Yuan. Article 92 of the draft submitted to the Constitutional National Assembly stated: "When the Examination Yuan submits a legal bill regarding matters under its jurisdiction, the Secretary-General of the Examination Yuan shall attend the Legislative Yuan to explain it." After review and amendment by the First Review Committee, it became: "The Examination Yuan may submit legal bills to the Legislative Yuan regarding matters under its jurisdiction." That is, Article 87 of the Constitution. The situation of the drafting was roughly like this. In addition to the Executive Yuan, only the Examination Yuan is allowed to submit legal bills to the Legislative Yuan, while the Judicial and Supervisory Yuans are both empty-handed. This is indeed an omission during drafting and should be resolved through consultation as soon as possible.</p>
<p>In short, although there is no explicit provision in the constitution, both the Judicial and Supervisory Yuans should have the same right to submit legal bills to the Legislative Yuan in terms of both reason and sentiment, and this limit is only applied to the matters under their jurisdiction. The final decision rests with the Legislative Yuan, which does not hinder the exercise of legislative power.</p>
<p>Supervisory Yuan's Opinion</p>
<p>[Our newspaper's Nanjing Dispatch, 11th] The Supervisory Yuan's opinion on the issue of submitting legal bills to the Legislative Yuan, presented at the meeting convened by the President with the heads of the relevant Yuans, is as follows:</p>
<p>The facts and reasons for the Supervisory Yuan's submission of legal bills to the Legislative Yuan are now described separately below:</p>
<p>(1) Factual Background:</p>
<p>(1) In order to exercise the powers conferred by the Constitution, the Supervisory Yuan drafted a draft of the Supervisory Law, which was approved at the 5th meeting held on June 19, and resolved to "request the Legislative Yuan to complete the legislative procedures as soon as possible," and sent the draft to the Legislative Yuan for review on the 21st. It also drafted the draft of the Organizational Regulations of the Committees of the Supervisory Yuan, which was approved at the 7th, 8th, and 9th meetings held on June 22, 23, and 24, and resolved to "request the Legislative Yuan to complete the legislative procedures as soon as possible," and sent the draft to the Legislative Yuan on the 24th.</p>
<p>(2) On June 26, the Legislative Yuan's Legal System Committee sent a letter stating that it would review the draft of the Supervisory Law at 3:00 PM on June 28, and requesting personnel to attend and explain. At the 12th meeting held on June 28, the Yuan publicly appointed three members, Tian Tongjin, Fen Honglie, and Chen Qinghua, to participate. Subsequently, on the 29th, at the 13th meeting, Committee Member Tian Tongjin reported that the Legislative Yuan could not accept the legal bills submitted by the Yuan because there was no explicit provision in the law.</p>
<p>(3) At the 14th meeting on June 30, Committee Members Chen Daji, Honglie, and Li Zhengle proposed the question of the Supervisory Yuan submitting legal bills. After discussion, it was decided to form a Research Committee on the Issue of the Supervisory Yuan Submitting Legal Bills, consisting of 22 Committee Members, including Tian Tongjin, to discuss concrete measures and submit them to the meeting. At the 16th meeting on July 2, the Committee submitted a report, and it was resolved to request the President to convene a meeting with the heads of the relevant Yuans (the President of the Supervisory Yuan, the President of the Legislative Yuan, and the President of the Judicial Yuan) to resolve the issue of the Supervisory Yuan submitting legal bills in accordance with the provisions of Article 44 of the Constitution.</p>
<p>(4) In accordance with the above resolution, the Yuan sent a letter to the President on July 3 for consultation.</p>
<p>(5) On July 3, the Yuan received Consultation No. 584 from the Legislative Yuan's Constitutional Yuan, stating that the submitted Supervisory Law military bill had been submitted to the Legal System Committee for review and report. According to the new law, the Supervisory Yuan's submission of legal bills to the Yuan did not seem to be based on any provision, and it was inconvenient to review. It was then submitted to the 16th meeting of the Yuan (Legislative Yuan), and it was resolved to follow the review opinions and it was inconvenient to review the case. At the same time, the case had been submitted by Yuan Member Mao Yihu and others as a separate case and was resolved to be handed over to the Legal System Committee for review and recorded on file. Furthermore, the draft of the Organizational Regulations of the Committees of the Supervisory Yuan, which had been submitted, was decided at the 16th meeting of the Yuan (Legislative Yuan): "The case was submitted by the Supervisory Yuan" without any basis, and was changed to be submitted by a member of the Legal System Committee of the Yuan (Legislative Yuan), and the original consultation was returned," and the record was made on file, etc., and the original two consultations were attached and returned to the Yuan.</p>
<p>(2) Reasons Why the Supervisory Yuan Can Submit Legal Bills:</p>
<p>(1) Article 58, Paragraph 2 of the Constitution stipulates: "The President of the Executive Yuan and the heads of the ministries and commissions shall submit the legal bills, budget bills, martial law bills, amnesty bills, declarations of war, treaties of peace, treaty bills, and other important matters, or matters involving the common relations of the ministries and commissions, to the Executive Yuan for discussion and decision." A careful examination of the meaning of the original text does not stipulate that the Executive Yuan can submit legal bills to the Legislative Yuan, but rather points out that the above-mentioned cases should be discussed and decided by the Executive Yuan, which is a necessary procedure for proposals. In addition, there is no basis for reference in the Constitution regarding the proposal issues of the Yuan.</p>
<p>(2) Furthermore, Article 71 of the Constitution stipulates: "When the Legislative Yuan is in session, the heads of the relevant Yuans and the heads of the ministries and commissions may attend and express their opinions." The words "heads of the relevant Yuans" in the article were originally "President of the Executive Yuan" in the draft at the time of constitution-making. At the second reading meeting, 34 representatives, including Shi Shangkuan, submitted an amendment in accordance with Article 24 of the Rules of Procedure, changing "President of the Executive Yuan" to "heads of the relevant Yuans." The reason was: "The heads of the Examination Yuan, the Judicial Yuan, and the Supervisory Yuan may attend the Legislative Yuan and express their opinions on legal bills under their jurisdiction."</p>
<p>This amendment was submitted to the 15th meeting of the National Assembly for discussion. Of the 1,400 representatives present, 947 voted in favor, indicating that when Article 71 was formulated at that time, the change from President of the Executive Yuan to heads of the relevant Yuans had already recognized that the Supervisory Yuan could submit legal bills to the Legislative Yuan.</p>
<p>Article 87 of the Constitution has the provision "The Examination Yuan may submit legal bills to the Legislative Yuan regarding matters under its jurisdiction," which has led to the Legislative Yuan's doubts about the Supervisory Yuan's proposals. However, the original text of the draft at the time of constitution-making stated, "When the Examination Yuan submits a legal bill regarding matters under its jurisdiction, the Secretary-General of the Examination Yuan shall attend the Legislative Yuan to explain it," and it seemed to only stipulate that the Secretary-General should attend the explanation. Later, due to a proposal by Shi Shangkuan and others, it was deemed unnecessary to stipulate that the Secretary-General should attend, and the article was amended. Therefore, the initial formulation of this article did not solely point out that the Examination Yuan could make proposals, while other Yuans were restricted.</p>
<p>According to the legislative practice of various countries in the world, if it is not stipulated by the constitution and is not prohibited, the legislative body can formulate a law to remedy the omissions in the constitution. The Provisional Constitution during the Political Tutelage period in our country did not stipulate the issue of various agencies submitting proposals to the Legislative Yuan. However, it was clearly stipulated in the Organizational Law of the National Government, indicating that the right to propose to the Legislative Yuan does not necessarily have to be stipulated in the constitution, and the constitution does not have a negative restriction prohibiting the Supervisory Yuan from proposing. It is possible to adopt the common practices of various countries and formulate another law, allowing the Supervisory Yuan to submit legal bills to the Legislative Yuan regarding matters under its jurisdiction.</p>

<p>[United Press Washington Dispatch, 10th] The Democratic National Convention will open in Philadelphia at 11:30 AM on the 12th. The main tasks of the convention will be to nominate presidential and vice-presidential candidates, pass the party platform, and take necessary measures related to the happiness of the entire party. The Democratic National Committee headquarters here stated that although there will be 1,596 delegates and the same number of alternate delegates attending the convention, the actual number of votes for electing the presidential and vice-presidential candidates is 1,234, and the necessary majority to secure the nomination will be 618 votes. The delegates attending the convention include delegations from forty-eight states. The delegates from Alaska and Hawaii, Puerto Rico, the District of Columbia, the Panama Canal Zone, and the Virgin Islands do not possess a majority of votes. Delegations with the most votes include: New York State with 98 votes, Pennsylvania with 74 votes, Illinois with 60 votes, Ohio with 50 votes, California with 54 votes, Texas with 50 votes, and Michigan with 42 votes. The voting strength of delegations from areas other than states is: Alaska with 6 votes, Hawaii with 6 votes, the District of Columbia with 6 votes, Puerto Rico with 6 votes, the Panama Canal Zone with 2 votes, and the Virgin Islands with 2 votes.</p>
<p>[Reuters Washington Dispatch, 11th] The 1,500 delegates of the Democratic Party are scheduled to meet in Philadelphia on Monday to select the Democratic candidate for the presidential election in November. Although Truman is widely dissatisfied with the party, since the major factions in the party cannot agree on the nomination of other candidates, Truman's election as the presidential candidate can be regarded as a foregone conclusion. The Democratic Party, which has been in power for sixteen years, has seen its internal opinions on domestic and foreign affairs split. Many party members admit that the political empire established by Roosevelt has been broken. The only person who can unite the party members is General Eisenhower, but Ike has repeatedly and firmly stated that he will not agree to be nominated as a presidential candidate. On the eve of the Democratic Party's National Convention, although it is preparing to nominate Truman as the presidential candidate, its lack of enthusiasm is rare in the history of the US presidential election. The strategists of the Democratic presidential campaign plan to focus on the party's domestic policies and policies to eliminate racial discrimination. However, regarding the latter, the Democratic members of the southern states firmly oppose the improvement of black people's treatment. Most of the southern voters are staunch supporters of the Democratic Party. Black people are only allowed to vote in certain areas of the country. The Democratic Party in the northern states relies heavily on black votes, especially in the states of Illinois, Pennsylvania, and New York. Truman's submission to Congress of a bill to protect the human rights of black people is to win the votes of the Democratic Party in the northern states. However, the Southern Democrats have stated that if the Democratic Party's presidential campaign uses the issue of black people's treatment as a wager, the Southern Democrats will not hesitate to withdraw from the National Convention. In addition, the secession of leftists from the Democratic Party under the leadership of Wallace has also greatly weakened the party's strength. According to a survey, 286 of the Democratic National Convention delegates have stated that they will support Truman, and they also said that they can obtain the support of another 354 delegates. It is not difficult for them to obtain 618 votes, which is more than half of the votes, and be nominated as the Democratic presidential candidate.</p>
<h3 id="e46">U.S. Democratic Vice-Presidential Candidate; All Eyes on Barkley; Douglas Declares Resolute Refusal of Nomination <a href="#e46" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c46" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">46</a></h3>
<p>[United Press Philadelphia Dispatch, 10th] According to the situation on the 10th, the Democratic National Convention may nominate Barkley as the vice-presidential candidate. Most people in the party have also turned to support Senate Democratic Leader Barkley as the vice-presidential candidate. The secretary of the Senate Democratic Policy Committee has predicted that Barkley will be nominated by the convention.</p>
<p>Barkley has long enjoyed a reputation in the South and border states. Although the New Deal faction supports Supreme Court Justice Douglas as the vice-presidential candidate (if the presidential candidate nomination fails), Douglas himself has declared that he will refuse to participate in any nomination. Some veterans from industrial states believe that Barkley and Douglas are suitable candidates. As for Truman's attitude, although it has not been announced, it is expected that he will accept it, because the human rights bill still makes the party uneasy. Many people believe that Barkley's candidacy may bring back Southern Democratic members.</p>
<h3 id="e47">Anti-Truman Delegates to Nominate Fiber <a href="#e47" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c47" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">47</a></h3>
<p>Mr. Fei is a Liberal Progressive</p>
<p>[United Press Philadelphia Dispatch, 10th] Anti-Truman delegates met on the 10th to discuss a plan to nominate a certain "liberal" as a presidential candidate at the Democratic Convention to "prevent an uncontested nomination" of Truman. This "liberal" may be Senator Lieber. The anti-Truman group includes the Political Action Committee of the Congress of Industrial Organizations, the American People's Democratic Action Association, and other factions. The Democratic Party Chairman of Nebraska, Li Yingyi, was nominated as its leader. He told reporters that 40 to 50 delegates from 20 states gathered to discuss the name of a "recognized liberal progressive democratic leader" to be released on the evening of the 10th. It is likely to be Zuber, who also attended the meeting and stated that if his campaign is urged by "liberals," he will accept the nomination.</p>

<p>[Reuters London Dispatch, 10th] Minister of State and Deputy Foreign Secretary McNiel delivered a speech at the United Nations Association banquet in Langford today, solemnly stating that the Berlin incident is by no means an isolated incident, but a focal point of various disputes. The UK's handling of the Berlin incident will be based on its consistent principle, that is, each has the ambition to cooperate, and the UK turns to be the first to engage in cooperation, but concession is not a substitute for cooperation, so the UK will never engage in progress.</p>
<p>On the same day, several other cabinet members also publicly talked about the Berlin question. Air Force Minister Huntenson, who will fly to Berlin on Sunday to observe the airlift situation, also delivered a speech in Winsford, Staffordshire, stating that it is terrible that the human rights and needs of millions of people are mortgaged due to differences between one country and another. If the Soviet leaders can lift the blockade and resolve the Ke controversy at the conference table, would it not be a great practical animal with a very valuable signal? Minister of Defence Alexander delivered a speech at Kirkpe, Nottingham, hoping that everyone could recognize the danger of the Berlin situation, and that permanent peace would be impossible to establish until the principles of justice and freedom were established. Deputy Foreign Secretary Mai Xiu delivered a speech in Noviquan, saying that the Soviet Union wanted to drive the Western powers out of Berlin, while the people of Berlin eagerly hoped that the Western allies would stay in Berlin, fearing that after the Western powers withdrew from Berlin, they would face the same fate as other anti-communist elements in communist-controlled countries.</p>

<p>[Reuters Berlin Dispatch, 10th] It is reported that British and Soviet military leaders in Germany have both been recalled to their countries to receive instructions regarding the Berlin crisis. British authorities announced that British Army Commander Bosen will fly to London on Monday to discuss the serious international situation caused by the blockade with the Foreign Office. According to confirmed information, Soviet Army Commander Sokolovsky returned to Moscow on Thursday to hold similar emergency talks with the government.</p>
<p>Moscow has remained silent on the note of protest against the Berlin blockade submitted by Britain, the United States, and France. However, according to Russian sources in Berlin, the Soviet Union will reject the protests of the three powers in strong terms. The reply will be submitted to the ambassadors of the three powers to the Soviet Union before Marshal Sokolovsky returns to Berlin on Monday. According to the Berlin Evening Express, which reflects the official policy of the Soviet Union, the note from the three powers did not close the door to East-West treatment.</p>

<p>[Associated Press Berlin Dispatch, 11th] US Air Force authorities announced today that the Soviet Union seems to be planning to launch a small-scale nerve warfare campaign against the pilots of the US and Britain who are airlifting supplies to Berlin, because the Soviet Union has announced that Soviet aircraft will practice blind flying in the air corridor between Berlin and West Germany. However, if this happens, there is little chance of a collision with British and American aircraft, because Soviet pilots are certainly no more likely to commit suicide than British and American pilots.</p>
<p>[Reuters Berlin Dispatch, 11th] The Soviet authorities today separately notified the British and American authorities, accusing the British and American aircraft of transporting food and other supplies from West Germany to Berlin without Soviet permission, and without prior notification to the Berlin Air Safety Control Station, which had violated air transport safety rules. At the same time, the climate in Berlin has improved, and British and American aircraft continue to land in Berlin in large numbers. By 11:00 AM, 100 American aircraft had landed.</p>
<p>[United Press Berlin Dispatch, 10th] The United States today warned the Soviet Union that if the Soviet Union insists on implementing the planned "instrument flight" along the Western Allies' Berlin air corridor, Soviet aircraft will be responsible for the risk.</p>

<p>[New Asia News Agency Seoul Dispatch, 11th] According to Pyongyang Broadcasting, the result of the 5th Joint Meeting of North and South Korean Political Parties was to pass the "Constitution of the Korean Democratic People's Republic" in North Korea alone. At the same time, in accordance with the Constitution, delegates to the Korean People's Congress were selected. It is reported that this election will be held on the 15th of this month.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency Seoul Dispatch, 10th United Press] Under the action of resisting the United Nations Korea plan, the North Korean communist puppet rulers announced that the North Korean election will be held on August 25. According to the Soviet-style constitution approved on May 1, the election announced by the North Korean People's Committee will adopt secret ballot. The elected parliament will then elect a 15-member presidium, which has the power to convene or declare a meeting closed, and enjoys privileges during the parliamentary recess. The constitution originally designated Seoul in the US-occupied area as the national capital, but the puppet government's statement stated that before the constitution can be implemented nationwide, its scope of exercise will be temporarily limited to North Korea. The Pyongyang Radio statement is a challenge to the United Nations and the United States, which are recently responsible for holding elections in South Korea.</p>

<p>[Our Own Dispatch] New York, 11th—Holla Brod's spokesperson, Da, stated: "The Arabs will never yield to pressure." He indicated: "The greatest pressure is no more than death; we Arabs would rather die than abandon the struggle against the Jews." Before deciding to resume hostilities, the Arab League Political Committee resolved that any steps taken against the Arabs would not benefit them. The Arabs may also take retaliatory steps. Currently, the Arab side supplies oil to the Americans, but what the United States supplies to the Arabs are merely luxury goods. This official stated that if Britain were to implement economic sanctions against the Arabs, Britain's losses would certainly be greater than those of the Arabs.</p>
<p>[United Press International, Cairo, 10th] A meeting of Arab officials to discuss Britain's request to extend the Palestinian truce will not conclude until dawn on the 11th. After a two-hour discussion with British Ambassador Campbell, Egyptian Prime Minister Nokrashy stated, "The ambassador insisted that the truce period must be extended, but I expressed my personal views." After Campbell left, Nokrashy immediately consulted with Arab League Secretary-General Azzam Pasha. It is noted that Azzam Pasha had announced his rejection of UN mediator Count Bernadotte's proposal to extend the truce by ten days.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Damascus, 11th] It has been officially confirmed that the Syrian government has received a telegram from the British government urging Syria to accept Bernadotte's proposal to extend the truce by ten days. The Syrian cabinet held a meeting today to discuss the matter, and the Syrian Prime Minister received the Egyptian envoy to Syria to discuss the issue. Yesterday, a dispatch from Washington indicated that Britain and America were using significant pressure to persuade Arab countries to agree to a ten-day extension of the truce, warning that otherwise, the UN Security Council would have no alternative but to impose sanctions. Relevant sources believe that the Syrian government's response, to be presented to the British envoy tonight, will neither accept this proposal nor promise to change the Syrian government's policy.</p>

<h3 id="e57">Soviet Union and Eastern European Satellite States Plan to Form a "Military Alliance"; Tito's Betrayal Thwarts Soviet Plans <a href="#e57" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c57" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">57</a></h3>
<p>[United Press International, London, 11th] East European diplomatic observers here claim that Marshal Tito of Yugoslavia's betrayal of the Cominform has prompted the Soviet Union to strengthen preparations for formally establishing a comprehensive "Eastern Bloc" to resist the "Western European Union." The method would be to merge the existing "Mutual Assistance Alliances" among Eastern European countries into a "Collective Defense" treaty against aggression from world capitalism. The meeting of Eastern European foreign ministers in Warsaw last month was the first step in the Soviet Union's preparations for establishing the "Eastern Alliance." It is estimated that the Eastern European foreign ministers will meet again soon to advance the "Eastern Alliance" plan.</p>
<p>Diplomatic circles also state that the foundation of the Soviet plan is a close military alliance, including automatic mutual assistance and close coordination of military forces, placing the armies of the signatory countries under Soviet command. Eastern European satellite states have a total of seventy divisions. Yugoslavia is the strongest, with approximately 500,000 soldiers. However, with Tito openly resisting the Cominform, the Soviet plan has not only been obstructed but also potentially overturned. Sources in Eastern Europe state that Tito's defection has made the Soviet Union even more eager to strengthen ties within its empire to prevent the formation of a separate Balkan alliance that would break away from Moscow. The Soviet Union and its Eastern European satellite states already have an intricate system of alliances and economic agreements. Except for Albania, it has mutual assistance agreements with all Eastern European countries, and most of these countries also have alliances with each other. The only deficiency is between Hungary and Romania. The main military and economic objectives of the "Eastern Alliance" are as follows: Militarily, to standardize the military equipment of countries within the Soviet sphere of influence, which the Soviet Union has already begun to do; Economically, to strengthen economic cooperation and encourage Soviet-style five-year plans. The Soviet Union already controls half of Eastern European trade.</p>

<p>[Reuters, Woodford, Essex County, 10th] Former wartime Prime Minister Churchill delivered a speech in his constituency today, harshly criticizing Soviet policy and strongly advising the government not to yield in the Berlin crisis. He said, "If we concede in this serious military issue, we will destroy the best chance to avoid a third world war. It must be understood that the Soviet Union is not a great power that can express its free will. The thirteen giants in the Kremlin have established themselves as masters of the brave Soviet people, ruling them with more autocratic and dictatorial means than any Tsar. No one knows what these thirteen giants in the Kremlin will do. They are not as reasonable as the Western world. Their primary interest lies in using wristbands to maintain their personal power over hundreds of millions of people of different races. The inside story of this oligarchy is unknown to the outside world. As far as I know, there are individual actions and even opposing actions within it. Otherwise, how can one explain that while the Berlin crisis is entering its climax, they still have the leisure to expel Yugoslavia from its group of vassal states?"</p>
<h3 id="e60">Cominform Issues Statement Condemning Yugoslavia (Continued) <a href="#e60" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c60" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">60</a></h3>
<p>(Originally published in "The Christian Science Monitor," translated by the US News Service)</p>
<p>The Cominform firmly believes that the Yugoslav leadership has modified the Marxist-Leninist theory of the Party. According to Marxist-Leninist theory, the Party is the basic leading force of the nation, with its own distinct platform, and cannot be confused with the non-Party masses. The Party is the highest form of organization and the most important tool of the working class. However, Yugoslavia believes that the leading force is not the Communist Party but the People's Front. The Yugoslav leaders underestimate the tasks of the Communist Party and, in fact, allow it to dissolve into the People's Front. The People's Front includes various different classes: workers, farmers with private economies, rich peasants, merchants, small factory owners, bourgeois elements, intellectuals, and various political groups, such as the bourgeois parties.</p>
<p>The Yugoslav political leaders stubbornly deny their ideological errors, believing that the Yugoslav Communist Party cannot and should not have its own distinct platform within the People's Front. In the Yugoslav political arena, only the People's Front is active, while the Communist Party and its various organizations do not openly act in their own name before the people. This fact not only reduces the role of the Communist Party in the country's political and economic affairs but also undermines its status as an independent political force. Only an independent political force can win greater confidence from the masses and attract more working people to its ranks through open political activities, open propaganda, and its platform. The main principles of the Yugoslav Communist Party originate from the errors of the Russian Mensheviks, who advocated liberating the Marxist party and turning it into a non-party mass organization. All of these situations prove that there is a tendency to liquidate the Yugoslav Communist Party. The Cominform believes that the policy of the Central Committee of the Yugoslav Communist Party endangers the very existence of the Communist Party and also carries the danger of the decline of the People's Republic of Yugoslavia.</p>
<p>(V) The Cominform believes that the bureaucratic policy within the Party is harmful to the life and progress of the Yugoslav Communist Party. There is no democracy within the Party, the principle of elections has not been realized, and there is no criticism or self-criticism. Despite various verbal assurances from Comrades Tito and Kardelj, most of the members of the Central Committee of the Yugoslav Communist Party were not elected but were selected to fill vacancies. In fact, the Party is legal, and Party meetings are not held or are held in secret. This fact is enough to undermine the Party's influence among the masses. Such an organization can only be called sectarian-bureaucratic. It leads a lively and decisive organism down the road to liquidation. It implements military methods within the Party, as Trotsky implemented. In the Yugoslav Communist Party, the rights of Party members are trampled on, and any criticism of Party procedures is followed by cruel retaliation. This must not be tolerated.</p>
<p>The Cominform believes that this shameful, purely Turkish-style reign of terror must not be allowed to exist in a Communist Party. For the sake of the existence and progress of the Yugoslav Communist Party itself, we demand an end to this regime.</p>
<p>(VI) The Cominform believes that the criticisms made by the Central Committee of the CPSU(B) and the Central Committees of other Communist Parties friendly to the Yugoslav Communist Party have pointed out and corrected all the necessary conditions for restoring its leadership. However, the Yugoslav Communist leaders, influenced by delusions of grandeur, do not honestly accept this criticism, nor do they take the path of courageously correcting their mistakes. Instead, they resent this criticism, adopt a hostile position, and deny their mistakes in an anti-Party spirit, violating Marxist-Leninist Party principles and reconciling themselves to their anti-Party errors.</p>
<p>When the leaders of Yugoslavia proved that they could not defend the criticisms of the Central Committee of the CPSU(B) and the Central Committees of other fraternal parties, they more directly deceived their Party and people. They did not allow the people to know about the criticism of their erroneous policies, and they also kept the real reasons for the dismissal of Comrades Zhujović and Hebrang a secret. (Note: Zhujović was the Yugoslav Minister of Finance, and Hebrang was the Minister of Light Industry.)</p>
<p>After the Yugoslav leaders were criticized by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and other friendly parties, they attempted to implement many left-leaning legal provisions through orders. They hastily issued orders regarding the nationalization of small industries and retail businesses, but there was no preparation for the implementation of nationalization. The haste with which these decrees were issued only made the supply of essential goods to the Yugoslav people more difficult. Similarly, they hastily issued a new law on agricultural taxation, which was also not adequately prepared in advance, and only served to disrupt the food supply to urban residents. Finally, they used grand declarations to proclaim their love and reverence for the Soviet Union, but it is already known that they are adopting a malicious policy towards the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>The Yugoslav Communist leaders announced a policy of liquidating capitalist elements in Yugoslavia. In a letter to the Central Committee of the CPSU(B) on April 13, 1948, Tito and Kardelj wrote: "The Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Yugoslav Communist Party is working hard to eliminate the vestiges of capitalism in our country."</p>
<p>Based on this concept, Kardelj stated in a speech to the People's Assembly of the Federal People's Republic of Yugoslavia on April 21: "In our country, all forms of exploitation of man by man are coming to an end." The Yugoslav Communist leaders can only be said to be adventurous and un-Marxist in adopting such a path to liquidate capitalist elements and the rich peasant class under the current conditions in Yugoslavia. In fact, this issue has not been resolved in Yugoslavia, because personal economies are still prevalent throughout the country, and personal economies are bound to produce capitalism. The conditions for implementing collective farms have not yet been prepared, and most farmers do not yet understand the benefits of collective economies. The experience of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union has proven that only on the basis of collective farms can the last and most numerous exploiting class, the rich peasants, be liquidated; and the liquidation of the rich peasant class is the main task of implementing collective farms.</p>
<p>In order to successfully liquidate the rich peasant class and all capitalist elements in the country, preparations must be made on the one hand to restrict capitalist elements, strengthen the alliance of workers and peasants under the leadership of the working class, and develop socialist industry. If this is done too hastily, it can only lead to irreparable losses. Only after these preparatory steps have been carefully implemented can the transition from restricting capitalist elements to liquidating capitalist elements be made.</p>
<p>The Yugoslav leaders want to create laws in the yamen in order to hastily solve this problem. Whatever their purpose, they are only expressing that they are engaged in an adventure that is doomed to failure, or else a declaration with ulterior motives. The Cominform believes that the purpose of these left-leaning orders and declarations by the Yugoslav leaders is to cover up their refusal to admit their mistakes and their refusal to honestly correct their mistakes.

<p>Yesterday, a Central News Agency reporter asked Garrison Commander Xuan Tiewu about the price issue. Xuan stated that the continuous rise in prices is causing public unease, so he is willing to assist the government's competent authorities in his capacity as a security official, adopting strict measures to curb the rising tide and suppress prices. However, the effectiveness of these measures will depend on whether the agencies in charge of finance and materials have the determination to make further efforts. He deeply feels that some current laws protecting legitimate industry and commerce are often exploited by opportunistic merchants as a pretext for cover, causing obstacles to the progress of punishing traitors. He also stated that the military and police agencies have not relaxed their investigation of various speculators and illegal merchants and are intensifying their efforts. The investigation work is aimed at the primary speculators in each industry, and the "lackeys" employed by others are not given importance. Punitive actions against traitors will be actively launched based on the principle of "not wronging anyone and achieving effective results." However, in order to achieve the expected results, close cooperation between all relevant government agencies and the greatest determination to work together is necessary.</p>

<p>The central government attaches great importance to the sharp rise in prices in the Beijing-Shanghai area this time and is aware that this phenomenon is mostly due to man-made factors. Therefore, it has secretly cabled all relevant agencies in the city to secretly investigate the causes and background. Regarding the fact that the Control Yuan intends to organize a Beijing-Shanghai price investigation team to come to Shanghai for thorough investigation, it is reported that the Control Yuan has decided to postpone the investigation for the time being and has cabled the Jiangsu Provincial Supervisory Commissioner's Office to begin secretly investigating and reporting first. The Control Yuan will then send personnel to Shanghai for investigation if necessary after the report is received.</p>
<h3 id="e64">The Cost of Soap Raw Materials Continues to Rise, Making It Difficult for Small and Medium-Sized Factories to Survive <a href="#e64" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c64" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">64</a></h3>
<p>Recently, the market price of soap has continued to soar. However, according to soap factory merchants, although the price of soap is so high, small and medium-sized soap factories still find it difficult to survive. The most expensive soaps on the market are all products of large factories, and the raw material composition they use is not significantly different from that used by small and medium-sized soap factories. The cost is not much different, but the selling price of soap produced by small factories is often only two-thirds of the selling price of so-called well-known brand soaps produced by large factories, and sometimes even less. At the same time, small factories have short funding and are more threatened by rising raw material costs than large factories. Also, after the sharp rise in prices this time, people's purchasing power has been greatly reduced, and actual soap sales have also greatly decreased. However, well-known brands such as Gu Ben and Xiang Mao are more often used as market bargaining chips, and demand has increased relatively. Therefore, the current situation of small and medium-sized factories is very precarious.</p>

In order to ensure the food supply in North China, the Ministry of Food had previously established a plan to purchase and store wheat flour. The funding required for the actual implementation of this plan is no longer a problem, so the food supply in North China can be said to be assured.</p>

<p>Qiu Menglin, a salt merchant from Huaibei in Shanghai (i.e., salt producer), and more than 150 other people, including Weinong, believe that the Huaibei Salt Affairs Administration has never collected opinions from the merchants when adjusting market prices in accordance with the provisions of the salt administration regulations, resulting in a situation where the market price is too far away from the rise in the necessary production costs, creating an unreasonable phenomenon, affecting the ability to regenerate production, and reducing national tax revenue. Recently, they have jointly telegraphed the Executive Yuan, the Ministry of Finance, and the Salt Affairs General Bureau, requesting that a reasonable adjustment be made again with reference to the price index in order to maintain production and enrich national taxes. It is reported that the authorities have agreed to consider it.</p>
<h3 id="e69">Increase in Pig Bristle Exports; Industry Hopes National Bank Authorities Will Quickly Plan for Loans <a href="#e69" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c69" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">69</a></h3>
<p>Zhang Yizhi, a giant in the pig bristle export industry, expressed his views on the recent export dynamics and future prospects of the industry on the 11th, stating that since the implementation of the new foreign exchange settlement method, the amount of rigorous exports has increased sharply by more than 100% compared to the previous months. According to the June export settlement figures, the value of pig bristles in Shanghai alone has reached as much as 1.8 million US dollars, indicating that the new method has a considerable effect on encouraging exports. However, this is a temporary phenomenon due to the backlog of export materials from the previous two months due to the unsuitable exchange rate, which have been enthusiastically exported after the change. As for materials from the production areas, exporters are limited by their financial resources and cannot go to purchase large quantities. Before the new method, exporters could borrow 70% of the loan from designated banks with foreign letters of credit, but now they can only borrow 20%, and it is becoming more difficult to transfer funds. If this is forced for a long time, the risk of pre-settling foreign exchange and pre-selling certificates for legitimate exporters will increase, and their purchasing power will decrease. It seems that the government's efforts to maintain this are not thorough. Therefore, all industry members hope that the National Bank authorities will quickly formulate proper loan methods for export materials and implement them as soon as possible. The second half of the year is the peak season for pig bristle production, which is the most important. Otherwise, once the season has passed, the goods will be abandoned on the ground, and the invisible foreign exchange losses will be difficult to compensate for.</p>

<p>[Our Own Dispatch] In the case of the conflict between British tram workers and Air Force personnel, the temporary joint military tribunal organized by the military, police, and military police interrogated the issue of responsibility for the incident overnight. However, both sides held their own views, and the injured tram driver and ticket seller were unable to appear in court to testify about the assault. The workers' representatives were also unable to provide strong evidence, so it was difficult to determine who was at fault for the time being. Finally, Liu Jinyi, the injured Air Force mechanic, was ordered to be handed over to Zhang Weihua, Director of the Supply General Office of the Air Force Supply Command, and transferred to the Air Force Hospital for treatment, to be available for questioning at any time. After the workers provide evidence, he will continue to be questioned. The details have been reported in yesterday's newspaper. Yesterday, Yan Zi, the leader of the 2nd Brigade of the Garrison Command, who is responsible for investigating the case, told reporters that the results of the interrogation the night before could not prove that the Air Force committed the crime of assault. If the workers can provide evidence, the authorities will severely punish the perpetrators. Also, Qiu Changjiang, Chairman of the British Tram Industry Union, told reporters that the injuries of driver No. 802 are still severe and have not yet improved. However, the workers expressed their trust in the handling of the military, police, and military police authorities and are now quietly awaiting a fair and reasonable resolution. Yesterday, all British tram lines left the factory on time and operated normally.</p>

<p>[Special Feature by Our Newspaper] Prices continue to skyrocket! Suppression by the military and police, and inspections of warehouses, have not stopped the surging tide of inflation. This is particularly difficult for salaried workers, especially working women. Of course, practically speaking, a simple blue cotton cheongsam could suffice, but loving beauty is a woman's nature, especially in this male-dominated society.</p>
<p>Today, when a working woman receives her salary, she can't even think about how to buy some gold or foreign currency to maintain its value. Their most important task at the end of the month is how to rush to the department store as soon as they receive their salary to buy what they need. In a corner of the accounting office, it's often as noisy as if a chicken coop has been overturned: "Lizhen, will you come with me to buy a tube of Max Factor lipstick later?" "Okay, I also want to buy a pair of nylon stockings, you know you won't be able to buy them anymore if you don't buy them now." Or "Qiuli, I didn't want to make a summer cheongsam, but when I took them out of the box, none of the collars were high enough." "Tailors will be against us, and so will shoemakers." "Mary, my hair is all straight, I have to get it done today."</p>
<p>**A Few Prices - Stunned to See**</p>
<p>But when they rush to the department store, a price list being revised in the clerk's hand scares them speechless:</p>
<p>Type 54 Nylon Stockings $15,000,000</p>
<p>Max Factor Lipstick $8,500,000</p>
<p>Also Rouge $4,500,000</p>
<p>Swatow Handkerchief $5,000,000</p>
<p>Evening in Paris Perfume $10,000,000</p>
<p>American Silk Fabric $15,000,000</p>
<p>The clerk says, "You're a step late, it was much cheaper a moment ago." These young ladies, with rare humility, say to the clerk: "We are regular customers, can you give us the old price?" The clerk smiles bitterly and says: "The boss told me to change it, I'm very sorry, I can't make an exception! The boss said: The cost of living has risen again, how can the prices not change?" So the ladies' plans and budgets are all ruined. They stand at the counter, stuck and unable to move forward or backward, and the clerk cleverly tempts them: "Miss, you should buy it! Maybe it will rise again tomorrow, prices follow the US dollar." They understand, but who knows what tomorrow will bring? Anyway, the price won't drop, so just buy it."</p>
<p>After buying it, stepping out of the store, they can't help but feel annoyed. Last month's salary could still buy four pairs of Type 51 nylon stockings, now it only buys three.</p>
<p>The lady whose hair was straight originally wanted to get a perm, but when she asked the price, it was three million yuan, so she immediately changed her mind and only had the hairdresser do her hair, which was also not cheap, one million four hundred thousand yuan. Naturally, the fifty thousand yuan for a manicure has been saved.</p>
<p>**Pursuing a Handkerchief - Disregarding Life**</p>
<p>Nowadays, working women have to constantly study clothing. First, from Monday to Friday, they don't easily wear nylon stockings, anyway, bare legs are still considered fashionable in the summer. On the same days, voile and American silk cheongsams also have to be saved. Fortunately, English printed cotton looks decent enough. In addition, glass handbags and white leather shoes are of course made of second-rate materials. On weekends, because there are usually some social engagements, they use their full set of the latest 1948 equipment.</p>
<p>When wearing the latest equipment to social events, their value often reminds them to be careful, don't lean on the back of a rickshaw, and don't let the oil stains on the awning stain your cheongsam! But, damn it! The more careful you are, the worse it gets! Suddenly, a gust of wind blew away the double-sided embroidered Swatow handkerchief in her hand. Thinking of its value of several US dollars, she hurriedly jumped out of the car to chase it, regardless of everything. This startled the passersby, who couldn't help but blurt out: "Hey! Car!" It turned out that a DeSoto car was passing by her. It was really dangerous! But she didn't feel it at all, because her nerves were tense and her attention was focused on the lost handkerchief. Only when she picked it up did a smile appear on her face.</p>
<p>**With Family Burdens - Needless to Say**</p>
<p>The "jitterbug" that was once popular on the dance floor has now been gradually abandoned by the ladies, not because they are afraid of sacrificing sweat, but because its movements are large and intense, which can easily damage glass silk. Breaking a pair of nylon stockings is a serious threat to the ladies these days. Even if, luckily, the area of ​​the run is not large, a mending fee is still an unexpected loss!</p>
<p>As for working women who are already mothers, their radiance is even dimmer. She said: My Beibei is sick, a bottle of 10MG Vitamin B is six million, my husband was laid off, and now he can only help me consume the household rice!</p>
<h3 id="e72">Miniature Combined Printing Letters - Chen Gongzhe Explains Advantages - Transforming Complexity into Simplicity - A Major Invention in the Cultural World <a href="#e72" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c72" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">72</a></h3>
<p>[Report by Our Newspaper] The Shanghai Literary Writers Association held its 63rd literary symposium at the Hongtu Hall of the Daguan Society at the intersection of Nanjing West Road and Ma Huo Road at 4:00 PM yesterday. Dozens of writers, including Wang Jinshan, Yan Duhe, Shi Chongpeng, and Lu Danlin, attended. Pan Gongzhan, the chairman of the association, presided over the meeting. The "Miniature Combined Printing Letters" designed by Chen Gongzhe, a famous archaeologist and inventor, were introduced at the meeting. Mr. Chen has extensively studied philology. Feeling that Chinese characters are too complicated and have many shortcomings, he began to sort them out and discovered that most characters can be analyzed and combined from several basic letters. Therefore, the 10,000 commonly used characters can be reduced to 400 to 2,000 basic letters. However, if there are only 400 basic letters, complex characters often require four to seven combinations, which is not simple enough. If there are 2,000 basic letters, although the number of combinations can be reduced, the number of letters is still too large. Therefore, Mr. Chen set 1,000 letters as basic letters, which can be combined into any commonly used Chinese character. In application, on average, 60 out of every 100 characters are original letters and do not need to be combined. 38 characters need to be combined from two letters, and two characters need to be combined from three letters. This does not cause any inconvenience or waste of time.</p>
<p>**Different Lengths and Widths - Letters Vary**</p>
<p>When these letters are used for printing, they are carved from wooden blocks. Because the shapes of the letters vary in length and width, the size of the combined characters is slightly different (as shown in the picture). However, Mr. Chen believes that this is not a problem, because Western characters also have differences in length and width. The shape and size of the letter wooden blocks are divided into: (1) square characters, 4 mm long and 4 mm wide; (2) rectangular, 4 mm long and 2.66 mm wide; (3) narrow characters, 4 mm long and 1.33 mm wide; (4) flat characters, 2 mm long and 4 mm wide; (5) particularly flat characters, 1 mm long and 4 mm wide; (6) small square block characters, 2 mm long and 2.66 mm wide; (7) right-angled characters, 5.33 mm long and 4 mm wide. Having 20 of each of these 1,000 letters is enough for a small printing shop to print documents and newspapers.</p>
<p>**Promoting Culture - Great Usefulness**</p>
<p>Mr. Chen also designed an inclined wooden tray to hold the letters, classified by four-corner codes, which is very convenient to retrieve. Its area and weight are 94% less than using ordinary lead type, and the cost is very low and convenient to carry. If it can be applied to townships or small cities, it will be of great use in promoting culture. In addition, Mr. Chen also plans to apply the combined letters to literacy education to achieve twice the result with half the effort. He is currently compiling rhyming teaching materials, and hopes that literary writers will assist in completing this work.</p>
<p>**Elderly Renowned Doctor - Lecturing on Teaching Methods**</p>
<p>Ding Fubao, a renowned doctor who is already 75 years old, also attended the meeting. He also has considerable experience in the study of Chinese literature. He believes that the current teaching methods of elementary school teachers are too dull and outdated. They do not know how to use interesting analysis to arouse children's interest. For example, when it comes to literacy, the character "王" (king) can be explained as three strokes representing heaven, earth, and man, and the vertical stroke in the middle connects heaven, earth, and man, which is the king. Another example is the character "雨" (rain). The stroke above is the sky, the curved shape is the cloud, the middle line is the tree, and the four dots on both sides are raindrops, which together form the character for rain. If it can be explained in this way, children will definitely remember it deeply, he said. The famous writers at the scene were very interested in Mr. Ding's opinions, and were particularly impressed by his youthful spirit despite his old age. The symposium ended happily in laughter.</p>

<h3 id="e76">Female Doctor Advocates Eugenics and Birth Control Movement - Already Supported by the Authorities - Plans to Establish Guidance Station <a href="#e76" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c76" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">76</a></h3>
<p>[Report by Our Newspaper] A Chinese Eugenics and Birth Control Promotion Association advocating the birth control movement has recently emerged in this city. The host is Dr. Sun Yanyu, a female doctor who is already over 50 years old. The association also gave four public speeches at the YMCA the day before yesterday, calling on citizens to deeply recognize the importance of eugenics and birth control. Dr. Sun believes that "sexual behavior" has been widely valued in various countries, but in our country, it still seems to carry a mysterious color, and no one has ever conducted systematic research and discussion on it. As a result, sexually transmitted diseases are prevalent among workers, cultural circles, and the working class. Moreover, due to difficult living conditions, they are unable to afford to raise children, and cases of abandoning babies are not uncommon. All of this affects family happiness on a small scale, and damages the morality of the entire society and nation on a large scale. Therefore, she is willing to emulate the "Marie Stopes" of China and is determined to actively explain the true meaning of "sexual life" in response to the current serious social pathology, and thereby promote eugenics and birth control. According to Lu Hong, the executive director of the association, the purpose of the association has now received enthusiastic support from the Municipal Health Bureau and the medical community. Their first step is to plan to establish a "Eugenics and Birth Control Center Guidance Station" in this city to accept inquiries, discussions, and criticisms from all walks of life as much as possible, and also to explain the theories and techniques of various contraceptive methods. Dr. Sun also went to Beijing last night to present her opinions to relevant authorities, hoping that the government can support the promotion of this work with the greatest strength. The slogans revealed by the association include: "Parents who actively give birth to children are the truly sacred parents! Accidental unintentional birth is a sin!" etc. It is said to be based on the principles of the International Planned Parenthood Federation. The association emphasizes that the unlimited increase in population is a sign of cultural backwardness. They also cited the provisions of US federal law on eugenics and birth control, hoping that our country can also add a law to encourage birth control in addition to the criminal law that passively punishes abortion, so that this society, which is disturbed by "sexual behavior" and suffers from pathological conditions, can recover as soon as possible.</p>
<h3 id="e77">Tianyuan Factory is Testing - Domestically Produced Degummed Ramie <a href="#e77" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c77" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">77</a></h3>
<p>Tianyuan Industrial Company's hemp, wool, and cotton weaving factory, founded by industrialist Rong Desheng, has been preparing for the export of domestically produced degummed ramie for more than a year, and has gradually started operations. According to Yang Tongde, the chief engineer of the factory, the ramie weaving is the first of its kind in China. Except for the China Textile Corporation, Tianyuan is the only private company. However, the degumming method is still in the experimental stage. In the future, if there are satisfactory results, the export prospects will be very optimistic. The factory expects to have mass production within this year. Most of the machines used are ordered from the United States and are the first batch to be exported after the war. It has now started operations with approximately 10,000 spindles. The daily production volume is 25 pieces of 20-count standard yarn, 5,000 yards of ramie cloth, 2,000 pounds of ramie thread (this thread is used for leather shoe soles and will be exported in the future), and 2,000 pounds of wool yarn. The results are still good. Regarding the source of raw materials, it is said that although cotton is lacking, textile weaving is the mother of light industry. The government is determined to find a way to maintain it and will definitely help solve the cotton difficulties. The raw material for ramie weaving is ramie, which is abundant in domestic production, has long fibers, and is very strong in tension. Now the United States has paid attention to this domestic specialty of ramie. Only the source of wool still depends on imports. The factory can only allocate 100,000 pounds per month. If two machines are started every day, it will be used up in more than 20 days. The current stock of wool materials is only enough for a few dozen days.</p>

<h3 id="e82">This Year's National Cotton Fields - More than 39 Million Mu - Estimated Cotton Stock Exceeds 22 Million Dan <a href="#e82" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c82" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">82</a></h3>
<p>The Cotton Production Improvement Advisory Committee of the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry and the National Cotton Textile Industry Federation jointly announced the estimated national cotton fields and the national cotton stock for the 37th year as follows on the 11th:</p>
<p>**National Cotton Fields - Little Increase**</p>
<p>(1) Estimated National Cotton Fields in 37 Years: This estimate (1) is based on the investigation and estimation reports of Hebei, Shandong, Shanxi, Henan, Su, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, Jiangxi, Hubei, Hunan, and Sichuan provinces, and (2) is based on the situation at the end of May this year.</p>
<p>The 12 provinces in the main cotton-producing areas this year have a total of 39,525,000 mu of cotton fields, which is only more than 1.7 million mu compared to the last report of 37,777,000 mu last year (the total national cotton fields of 38,861,000 mu last year included 1,084,000 mu in Gansu, Yunnan, Fujian, Liaoning and other provinces). The increase is not much. This is closely related to domestic security. Comparing the provinces, except for Shandong Province, which has a relatively large increase, Hebei, Shaanxi and Jiangsu have also increased slightly, and the rest are not as good as last year. In Jiangsu Province, cotton fields in the Jinghu area have increased, while those in Subei have decreased. This is also enough to show the influence of security and the amount of cotton fields.</p>
<p>**Investigation in Bandit Areas - Cannot Be Conducted**</p>
<p>The investigation work in bandit areas has not been able to proceed smoothly. For example, in Henan Province, only the eastern, western, and part of the central production areas of Henan Province were investigated on the ground. The rest were estimated after repeated inquiries. The same is true in Shanxi Province. In Jiangsu Province, Shuyang, Fucheng, Lincheng and other counties, in Hebei Province, Wucheng, Nanpi and other counties, in Shaanxi Province, Hancheng, Baishui and other counties, in Anhui Province, Fuyang, Fengtai and other counties, and Wei relied on special circumstances, or because traffic was blocked, all were completed by estimation or correspondence investigation. In Hunan Province, some production areas could not be fully investigated due to obstruction.</p>
<p>The cotton field investigation this year was started early, hoping to be published as soon as possible. However, the bandit unrest has not ended, or postal and telecommunications are blocked, and news is difficult to communicate, or it is in the midst of war, and it is impossible to carry out the work. Although we have tried every means to overcome it, it has not met the ideal.</p>
<p>**Warfare Everywhere - Work is Difficult**</p>
<p>(2) The first national cotton stock estimate in 37 years:</p>
<p>This estimate (1) is based on the situation at the end of May this year, (2) this year's estimate focuses on the cotton stock of cotton farmers, and also includes the cotton stock of some commercial firms and peddlers, (3) local cotton farmers in Hebei Province have the habit of storing seed cotton, so this article records its number separately. A small amount of seed cotton is also stored in a few cotton-producing areas such as Fengxian in Jiangsu Province, which is also recorded according to the facts. The estimated total amount in Hebei, Shandong, Henan, Shaanxi, Hubei, Hunan, Jiangxi, Anhui, Jiangsu, and Zhejiang provinces is 2,241,466 thousand dan.</p>
<p>Although the estimation of cotton stock began last year, it is still in its initial stage this year. The work is difficult, and the flames of war are everywhere, and the progress is hindered a lot. Cotton merchants and firms have many concerns, and the reports are far from detailed. Even in terms of this year's estimate, the records of Hebei Province and Jiangsu Province are still satisfactory, but there are still some counties that cannot estimate the flower stock of commercial firms or cotton peddlers. In other provinces, only 21 counties such as Qidong and Linqing in Shandong Province, the eastern counties of Henan Province and 28 counties such as Yanbin, 29 counties such as Xianyang Xingping in Shaanxi Province, 12 lake counties in Hunan Province, and 20 counties such as Huaining Dongliu in Anhui Province have been investigated for cotton stock, and the rest are missing. Although not a complete picture, it has done its best.</p>

<p>[Report by Our Newspaper] On the 28th of last month, Yong'an First Yarn Factory in Hudong Xihu Road lost two pieces of Jincheng brand fine cloth, totaling 80 bolts.

Qiu Yongkuan, a worker at the factory, was arrested the day before yesterday on suspicion of having committed a serious crime. He was immediately taken to the bureau for interrogation. He confessed to stealing the goods and said that there were three other workers who committed the theft with him. He continued to send police officers to investigate and arrested the three accomplices together. They all confessed to the truth. A few police officers accompanied the criminal Qiu to the factory the day before yesterday to demonstrate the process of stealing. Unexpectedly, when he first arrived at the question of the two-story building to the third floor, the criminal jumped off the building to commit suicide when the police officers were unprepared. He broke his bones on the spot and was seriously injured. He was sent to Gongji Hospital for treatment, but he died at noon yesterday. Afterwards, the police bureau sent the body to the autopsy office on Changde Road for examination, and the case file was sent to the District Prosecutor's Office for review.</p>

<p>[Report by Our Newspaper] The Great Shanghai Theater at No. 500 Xizang Road opened the morning film yesterday, as usual, to entertain the national army. At about 10:30 a.m., the theater screened "The World to Come." Before 10:00 a.m., all the seats in the theater were declared full, and there was almost no room for those who came later, so they jumped onto the stage one after another. The theater staff could not stop them. Many people roared loudly and tore down the red silk curtain, which was very tense. Later, the Lao Zha Police Station received a report and led by section chief Jiang and section member Xue Yunbo and other military police officers arrived at the scene to persuade them. The film continued to be screened, and the storm subsided. Afterwards, the general manager of the theater, Ren Jinping, told reporters that the loss of tearing down the silk curtain was about 4 billion yuan in legal tender. The Film Association will send someone to the theater to investigate.</p>

<p>— Jiang Xuan Yi</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Changsha, Our Newspaper, 1st] Many artifacts have been unearthed in Changsha, but very few have been preserved. There are two or three shoes, a large number of sword sheaths and silk used to wrap feathers, all completely destroyed by the soil. I have a few fragments. Also unearthed was a piece of fine silk painting with writing and strange books (only one piece). The original was borrowed from a certain antique dealer by a beauty with a deposit of one thousand yuan, and has not yet been returned. This Warring States document can be considered a national treasure and should be recovered by the state. This document on silk backing was originally enclosed in a bamboo box, a thick stack, but only one piece can be unfolded and read. The silk is fine and dense.</p>
<p>Strange Monster Patterns Awaiting Verification</p>
<p>The patterns on the edges of the silk-backed document include human bodies with horned heads, and one body with three heads, monsters from the "Classic of Mountains and Seas." There are many aspects that need to be verified. In the seven or eight hundred characters of the text, it generally speaks of "mountains and rivers, four green and red emperors, green emperors, and the like." The first sentence begins with the word "畋," which is not found in dictionaries. Only the "Yu Hai Lei Bian" has a similar character, with the local saying "Chu people asking about good and bad fortune." From this document, I can definitively prove that these unearthed objects belong to the culture of the Chu people. As for this document, there are more than eighty single characters. Although the seal script is the same as the inscription on the Prince Ding cauldron in Shou County, many characters cannot be deciphered. I cannot list them all here.</p>
<p>Steel Mirror Unearthed: Qin or Chu?</p>
<p>Among the bronzes, the only beautiful one is the bronze mirror. Because bronze mirrors are personal items, they are made with special care and are likely considered objects for the city dwellers. The characteristics of Chu bronze mirrors are: first, they are thin; second, they have a river-shaped knob; and third, they often have strange birds, beasts, and plant patterns. These bronze mirrors were first unearthed in Shou County, then in Luoyang. Foreigners call them Qin mirrors and say they are products brought into China from the Scythian culture. However, I personally collected more than thirty different bronze mirrors in Changsha, and saw more than three hundred unearthed. Their patterns are quite similar to the patterns on lacquerware, so it may not be inappropriate to call them Chu mirrors.</p>
<p>Various Stone Tools: Tripods, Pots, Cups, and Plates</p>
<p>The material of the stone tools is soapstone, with forms such as tripods, pots, cups, and plates. The amber-colored objects are a lion and a duck. There is a lot of glass, with the large inlaid beads being the most beautiful. Agate and crystal are also unearthed in large quantities, but I am not interested in those without patterns and have sacrificed them. A pair of fire-lacquered bracelets, whose material was unknown at the time, were later identified as rosin after careful observation. There is a character "玟" in the Shuowen Jiezi, which describes this type of material. Hundreds of pieces of ancient jade have been unearthed, but the forms are rarely varied. Gold and silver items include seals, rings, or plate-shaped objects.</p>
<p>Among them, the pottery funerary objects from the Han Dynasty are yellow and green, while those from the Chu period are black, or black with painted patterns. There is also a type of clay tablet with the characters "Ying Cheng" on it. People generally interpret it as "Ying Temple" or "Ying Yuan," but the ones I collected clearly say "Ying Cheng."</p>
<p>National Art: Concentrated Research</p>
<p>Having the opportunity to collect these Chu artifacts, I feel that the best way to collect ancient objects is systematically, to easily understand the customs and art of a particular ethnicity. The patterns on ancient artifacts are actually more important than the writing. Writing is easily unified by political power, while patterns are folk customs and are not easily changed by foreign groups. The cultural history of China before the Han Dynasty was actually different in each region. Therefore, regional research is more interesting than dynastic research by Tang, Yu, Xia, Shang, and Zhou. As for the accurate dating of these Chu artifacts, one can only hope for a planned excavation, or for archaeological enthusiasts to collect them together, so that the materials can be concentrated for comparative research. Although the ancient artifacts unearthed in the Changsha area are now rarely seen, many strange items remain in the hands of antique dealers. After some time, these precious materials of cultural history may all flow out to foreign countries.</p>

<p>[Special Dispatch from Jiashan, Our Newspaper, 10th] At the end of last year, in the county town, a kidnapping and extortion case occurred, in which a massive sum was extorted, and the victim's body was dumped into an ancient well.

<p>[Special Dispatch from Liangquan, Our Newspaper, 8th] Cantonese porcelain merchants here have received news from Hong Kong that the external sales of Jingdezhen porcelain in Hong Kong have recently been hit by the dumping of Japanese porcelain. Since Japan has expanded its foreign trade, it has dumped a large quantity of its existing porcelain in that area. The sales of Chinese porcelain in Southeast Asia have been greatly affected. Porcelain merchants in this city, who consider Hong Kong and Southeast Asia as the main sales markets for Chinese porcelain, are currently devising countermeasures to try to save the critical situation.</p>

<p>The Culprit is a Young Military Officer</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Panyang, Our Newspaper, 7th] The investigation results of the murder case at the Taifeng Restaurant in Beishi Market, Panyang, on June 30th, have fully clarified the situation. It is a marriage tragedy under the control of old ethics. The 19-year-old girl, Qiu Xiqing, who was blown to death, and the young military officer who committed suicide after disgracing his family, were in love with each other and wanted to be together. However, the conservative local customs caused laughter. The girl's father, upon hearing this, was furious and sent the girl to Shenyang in April, forcing her to find another home. The girl did not dare to disobey her father's orders, so Wu Wang Rulan introduced her to Liu Hanwen for engagement. According to Liu Hanwen, Qiu Xiqing, her brother-in-law, and sister-in-law looked distracted at the banquet, and Qiu looked even more worried. Wu Wang Rulan said that at that time, Qiu saw the young military officer enter the next room, and they whispered to each other, looking very uneasy, and went downstairs several times. It is reported that when the incident occurred, a small paper package fell from the Taifeng Restaurant. A child from the neighboring Zhongmei Stationery Store picked it up. Inside were two talisman symbols, named Zhang Jiabao and Shi Yuyou, and two travel permits. From this, it is inferred that the military officer involved was either Zhang or Shi, who had a relationship with the girl, and hated her for being unfaithful, so he committed the crime.</p>

<p>[Special Dispatch from Suzhou, Our Newspaper, 11th] Yang Shijie, the fake Songjiang County Magistrate, was previously arrested by the Jiangsu High Court and sentenced to seven years in prison. He was detained in the Wu County sub-prison on Siqian Street and was still undergoing review by the Supreme Court. In the afternoon of the 10th, the Criminal Division of the Jiangsu High Court suddenly discovered that the Yang criminal had been privately released on the afternoon of the 9th by someone who had stolen the High Court's seal, the personal seals of the presiding judge Yao Fuxiang and the clerk Yan Youzhi, as well as the arrest and release warrants. The High Court and the Local Court dispatched bailiffs to search everywhere and thoroughly investigated the police officers involved in the illegal act. It was quickly discovered that the thief who stole the seals and arrest and release warrants was the Criminal Division bailiff Cao Gengsheng, who had abandoned his post and fled to Shanghai, hiding at 44 Jumen Road. The chief bailiff Su Shunmin was immediately dispatched to arrest him and bring him back for questioning. He confessed to bribery and conspiracy to release the prisoner. He was immediately handed over to the Wu Local Prosecutor's Office for investigation according to law. As of the time of this reporter's writing, the fugitive and other police officers involved in the illegal act were still being investigated.</p>

<h3 id="e94">Shenyang Under the Iron Wings <a href="#e94" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c94" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">94</a></h3>
<p>— Our Reporter Zhao Zhan</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Panyang, Our Newspaper, 8th] Since the land transportation between Panyang and the interior has been cut off, becoming an isolated island beyond the border, the population has flowed south in large numbers. The number of people flying in the air accounts for about three-tenths of those crawling on the land. The population of Shenyang in March was 1,130,000, in April it was 1,122,000, in May it was 993,000, and in June it was 996,000. It decreased month by month, but June was 3,000 more than May, possibly due to an increase in refugees. This is the largest population evacuation in Qingyang's history. Recently, air transport has been strengthened. Under the situation of iron wings covering the sky, people generally realize that where can they escape to in a vast foreign land? They hesitate to move forward. All of this is like a chaotic dream. Now everyone is no longer anxious about airplane tickets, but worried about the air transport office. It is a great loss for the planes to return empty. On the contrary, it is more difficult to get to Panyang from Beiping than to climb to the blue sky. It is said that even black market tickets are hard to buy.</p>
<p>Air Exchange of Population and Food</p>
<p>Population and food are exchanged in the air. Everyone takes away a hungry stomach, and every plane comes back full of food. However, the food shortage situation in Panyang has not improved and is becoming more serious.</p>
<p>Someone made a small statistic: In the Xiaoxi District, which is known for its commercial prosperity, most of the residents were well-fed families. But now, about half of them eat chaff and bean cakes, and many of the other half drink thin porridge. On the main streets of Panyang, women and children scramble to pick up tree leaves to make a living, and those who collapse from hunger can be seen everywhere.</p>
<p>Impoverished People Oppressed: Suicide by Drowning</p>
<p>Cases of suicide due to the oppression of life are heard almost every day. Here are two examples of suicide victims: (1) Wang Shen, a 57-year-old street vendor at No. 21, Section 4, Xiaodong Street, was never full even after eating bean cakes every day. Feeling deeply disillusioned with life, he drowned himself in a water tank on June 26 while his wife and daughters were asleep. (2) Zhao Lianju, a resident of No. 2, Lane 3, Furen Street, Tawan District, was poor and without food. He died of illness, leaving behind his wife (28 years old) and a son. After his death, he had no money to buy a coffin. In grief and anger, he poisoned himself to death on June 24.</p>
<p>On July 5, the Northeast Materials Adjustment Bureau announced the cessation of food rations for the families of public school personnel, which was like a bolt from the blue. Someone in the office complained loudly: "Does the government still need civil servants? It would be better to ask Yang Mei to work in the office."</p>
<p>Selecting Special Police to Maintain Order</p>
<p>Along with the soaring prices, there has been an increase in theft and robbery cases. According to figures released by the municipal government, there were 36 theft cases, 7 robbery cases, and 1 snatching case in June. However, a review of the statistics for May is shocking: 30 robbery cases, 180 theft cases, and 10 murder cases. I believe this statistic is more complete and accurate. The number of murder cases in June actually increased compared to May, which is enough to show the economic downturn and instability of society. To maintain order, the police department has selected 21,385 special police officers in various districts, dedicated to collecting intelligence.</p>
<p>In the increasingly deserted Shenyang, the only crowded scene is on the trams. Many soldiers, relying on their arms and courage, hang outside the trams, speeding through the city, which is not only unsightly but also worrying. Thirty-two trams run every day, with an average of 92,000 passengers per day, of which one-quarter do not buy tickets.</p>
<p>Urban Demonstration Area: Strengthening Municipal Administration</p>
<p>In addition, a description of an urban demonstration area is needed to get a glimpse of the municipal administration. The policies promoted in this demonstration area are as follows: (1) Requiring shops and households to set up sanitary water buckets to prevent dust from flying around. (2) Designating garbage dumps in each Bao and transporting newly generated garbage every day. (3) Repairing five public toilets for the convenience of citizens. (4) Planting 1,400 roadside trees. (5) Establishing four literacy classes for women and children. (6) Convening household head meetings to explain district policies. (7) Visiting families of soldiers who have enlisted. (8) Teaching residents to sing "Protect the Northeast Song." (9) Strengthening citizens' cooperatives. (10) Conducting a survey of the lives of the extremely poor. The results are quite remarkable.</p>

<p>A letter from the Business Office of the Beijing-Shanghai Railway Bureau reads: "To the esteemed editor: Today's 'Social Services' section of your newspaper contains a letter from Mr. Song Botong criticizing the shuttle buses of our railway. The actual handling situation is hereby replied as follows: The handling of shuttle bus services in the Shanghai urban area by our railway is purely for social service. All operating routes and passenger pick-up and drop-off points along the way are handled in accordance with the regulations of the Municipal Public Works Bureau. We deeply regret the fact that Mr. Song was refused service by the attendant of Route 1 to Jing'an Temple on Tibet Road. However, we should state to Mr. Song that this measure is neither due to any negligence on the part of our railway nor due to the deliberate negligence of the attendant. It is because the Municipal Public Works Bureau has stipulated that when the buses of our railway transport passengers from the North Station to the urban area, passengers are not allowed to board the bus midway; and when picking up passengers from the urban area to the North Station, passengers are not allowed to get off the bus midway. The attendant was strictly complying with government regulations, which resulted in Mr. Song not being able to board the bus. This was not an intentional slight to the customer. We would appreciate it if you could understand this. If the attendants of our railway are disrespectful in speech or attitude, or if there are other cases of abuse, please let us know at any time. We will rectify and improve to meet your expectations. Sincerely, Social Services Column of Shen Bao."</p>

<h3 id="e99">General Commodity Prices: Silver Market Eases on Weekends, Inflation Spreads Like Wildfire <a href="#e99" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c99" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">99</a></h3>
<p>After the inflation of June, the market seemed to have been washed clean by a violent storm and torrential rain. After the storm, there would naturally be a temporary calm. However, the weather in June and July is abnormal, so after a short period of silence, the market is showing signs of stirring again.</p>
<p>Regarding market trends for selected goods, after the sharp rise, the authorities routinely imposed strict controls, such as inspecting warehouses, supervising markets, and questioning speculators. Under these circumstances, prices generally did not move much, especially in the cotton yarn and grain trades. However, the trend of prices hovered and advanced at a high level, with stability tinged with optimism. By the weekend, it seemed to show a linear upward trend again. Last week, the silver market showed signs of easing. The exchange situation between national banks fluctuated, but the underground interest rates remained high, fluctuating between four and four and a half corners. This is probably because people still expect prices to rise, so they are unwilling to easily release funds.</p>
<p>State-owned and public utilities adjusted new prices one after another last week after the June inflation: (1) Starting from July 9, the prices of passenger and freight on all railways across the country were adjusted, with passenger transport increasing by 90% and freight transport increasing by 150%. (2) The new prices for water, electricity, and gas in this city were adjusted starting from July 4, with water increasing by 175% and gas increasing by 171%. (3) Starting from July 9, the new prices for public transportation were adjusted, with trolley cars increasing by 156%, buses increasing by an average of 156%, small railways increasing by 130%, and ferries increasing by an average of 170%. In short, it is an environment of rising prices, and some people say that the government is also leading the price increases.</p>
<p>The interest rates on loans from national banks were approved by the Joint Treasury last week and still adopted a differential interest rate system, and the calculation method was determined as follows:</p>
<p>A. The interest on various types of loans undertaken by various banks and bureaus shall be calculated separately according to the following grades:</p>
<p>(1) National policy loans: monthly interest of 8.5%, (equivalent to one-third of the listed market interest rate.)</p>
<p>(2) Business loans: divided into the following three types: (1) Export and transportation public utilities with a monthly interest of 1.5%, (equivalent to 60% of the listed market interest rate. (2) Industrial and mining production enterprises with a monthly interest of 1.8%, (equivalent to 70% of the listed market interest rate.) (3) The monthly interest rate for the transportation and sale of daily necessities for people's livelihood is 20%, (equivalent to 80% of the listed market interest rate.) The above-mentioned interest rates at all levels should still be adjusted at any time with reference to the listed market interest rate according to the composite ingredients.</p>
<p>B. The interest rate and discount for each bank's mortgage rediscount and re-mortgage to the Central Bank shall be calculated according to the following regulations:</p>
<p>(1) Interest rate: (1) National policy loans are reduced by a monthly interest of 2.5% compared to the original loan rate. (2) Business loans: A Export and transportation public utility loans are reduced by a monthly interest of 1.5% compared to the original loan rate, B Industrial and mining production enterprise loans are reduced by a monthly interest of 1% compared to the original loan rate. C Loans for the transportation and sale of daily necessities for people's livelihood are still calculated at the original loan rate.</p>
<p>(2) Discount: (1) National policy loans: 80% discount. (2) Business loans: 70% discount. According to the recent Central Bank's listed rediscount interest rate of 8 yuan per thousand yuan, the combined monthly interest rate is 2.4%. Calculated on a compound interest basis of 12 months a year, the sum of principal and interest will increase by about 13 times. The high inflation rate is an inevitable consequence of high interest rates, but with prices jumping so abnormally, how can the government not raise interest rates? Therefore, under the two major prerequisites of assisting in increasing production and stabilizing prices, the authorities' decision on interest rate policy should indeed be deeply considered.</p>
<p>The long-awaited US aid issue was signed on the 3rd of this month by our Foreign Minister Wang and US Ambassador Stuart, representing the Chinese and American governments respectively. So far, a preliminary stage has been completed. According to Foreign Minister Wang's explanation, it is not easy to obtain US aid. China should at least be responsible for the following points:</p>
<p>(1) A small portion of the US aid funds will be used for special construction projects, and a separate negotiation method may be required in the future. The rest is of a grant nature.</p>
<p>(2) The Chinese government promises to reduce trade barriers and promote foreign commercial relations, etc.</p>
<p>(3) The US reserves the right to terminate assistance at any time. From this point of view, US aid also has somewhat unconditional conditions. It is estimated that the value of US aid can make up for more than half of the current monthly fiscal deficit. We do not deny the importance of US aid in stabilizing the economy. How to make good use of it is a major key for the authorities to save the current economic crisis.</p>
<p>The commodity market trend last week was that at the beginning of the week, due to the authorities' strict control, there was very little trading. Idle funds had no way out and poured into the stock market, resulting in consecutive limit-up gains at the beginning of the week, and new prices were frequently seen. It was relatively quiet in the middle of the week, and by the weekend, due to the easing of the silver market, it tended to be enthusiastic again.</p>
<p>The yarn and cloth market saw very little trading at the beginning of the week. By the weekend, the inflation wind rose again. 42-count Blue Phoenix once stood at 1.9 billion on Friday, and Dragon Head Fine Cloth broke the 40 million mark.</p>
<p>In the grain market, because the authorities stipulated on the 4th that the limited price of rice was 16 million, and adjusted it to 20 million on the 7th, there was very little trading in the market. Outside the market, asking prices threatened to directly hit the 30 million mark. Oil and flour also rose in unison. For example, the price of vegetable oil and bean oil was about 50-60 million on the weekend, and the asking price for Bingchuan No. 1 flour hit a new high of 8.9 million. Daily necessities such as cigarettes, soap, and matches fluctuated slightly, but rebounded across the board on the weekend. The remaining categories such as metals, chemicals, and building materials were all hovering and advancing above their peaks.</p>

<p>(1) Silver Market Underground Interest</p>
<p>Last week, the silver market in this city was tighter outside the industry than inside the industry, and tighter in the morning than in the afternoon. As far as the trend of the week is concerned, the silver market gradually changed from tight to relaxed.</p>
<p>The reason why the silver market is tight outside the industry is that the currency is constantly searching for orders and the supply is insufficient. Within the industry, because the old debts were just cleared after the end of June and the new loans have not yet started, the funds are generally loose. As for why the silver market is looser in the afternoon than in the morning, it is because of the influx of remittances from other places in the afternoon. Furthermore, because the national banks reversed from inflows to outflows last week, and idle funds from other places continued to arrive, the silver market in this city gradually became looser on Thursday and Friday.</p>
<p>Speaking of cash chips, they have been generally short and small in the past week. The reasons are nothing more than: First, prices are high, and the circulating chips are relatively scarce; second, since the Yu Guan Bureau prohibited banks from applying for transfers of deficits, banks have tried to compensate with cash for insufficient funds, resulting in a shortage of cash chips during exchanges; third, the cash reserves of national banks are nearing exhaustion, and payments are often felt to be sluggish, leading to rumors of issuing large banknotes again.</p>
<p>Underground interest rates have generally risen in the past half month. The high interest rate of 3.6 corners has generally risen to about 4 corners, and the highest is even 4.5 corners. The rise in interest rates can be said to be the inevitable result of currency depreciation and soaring prices.</p>
<p>Last week, the exchange results of national banks reversed from inflow to outflow. From Friday to Monday, a total of 1.6488 trillion was withdrawn. If the fixed deposits of commercial banks are deducted, totaling 230 billion, the actual withdrawals of banks should be in the range of 2 trillion. A significant phenomenon last week was that the Central Bank's interbank fixed deposits decreased significantly, which was affected by the repeated increases in the interbank lending rate, which exceeded the interbank deposit interest rate.</p>
<p>From Monday to Friday last week, foreign banks had a net inflow of 2.9351 trillion.</p>
<p>The silver market of commercial banks was generally peaceful. Interbank lending was quite high before Wednesday, and lending decreased after Wednesday. Internal turnover was very convenient. The exchange results of banks after the 60th of the month from Monday to Friday showed a net outflow of 3.9526 trillion, and the trend gradually decreased after Tuesday. This also shows the general easing of the silver market.</p>
<p>(2) Internal and External Exchange Rates</p>
<p>Last week, the foreign exchange market proved to have little volatility. It was around 2 million on Monday, once fell to more than 1.9 million on Tuesday and Wednesday, and then rose slightly to 2.07 million on Thursday and Friday. However, the sale period of exchange settlement certificates has been changed from 7 days to 30 days. The Hong Kong exchange rate was generally 1.34 Hong Kong dollars per 100,000 legal tender. The market price of Hong Kong US dollars was 5.37 yuan. Gold rose from 315.75 yuan to 321.25 yuan per tael.</p>
<p>Last week, domestic exchange rates fluctuated. The Guangzhou exchange rate was 400 yuan on Monday, fell to 350 yuan from Tuesday to Thursday, and then increased to 400 yuan on Friday. The Xiamen exchange rate was 450 yuan on Monday, Wednesday, and Thursday, and soared to 600 yuan on Friday. The flow of funds should be very drastic. The Chongqing exchange rate was 50 yuan on Monday, then fell to 10 yuan, and returned to 50 yuan on Friday. The Hankou exchange rate continued to rise, from 100 yuan on Monday to 280 yuan on Friday. The Tianjin discount was 50 yuan except for 20 yuan on Tuesday.</p>
<p>(3) Chinese and Foreign Stock Markets</p>
<p>At the beginning of the week, the Chinese stock market was experiencing difficulties due to the authorities' stringent suppression of prices and the inability to trade in the yarn, cloth, and grain markets. Capital had nowhere to go, creating a situation where all streams converged into the stock market. There were also news reports that Yongsha would be holding a shareholders' meeting. The market opened with a limit-up of 6,330 yuan, and other stocks also saw active investment and mostly hit their limit-up prices. In the afternoon of that day, Yongsha immediately called for 6,623, hitting the limit-up price. People were optimistic, creating a situation of overall gains.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, funds continued to pour in, and Yongsha again hit the limit-up price of 6,965 yuan. The market was vibrant, with 20 stocks hitting the limit-up price, and only 5 stocks not hitting the limit-up price.</p>
<p>By Wednesday, after two consecutive days of gains, people were wary of the high prices and sold to take profits. Although Yongsha once reached a new high of 7,200 yuan, it eventually returned to calmness. The overall market fluctuated and was mixed. Yongsha only rose slightly by 35 yuan compared to the previous day, and more stocks fell than rose.</p>
<p>On Thursday, the market situation was still mixed, and people maintained a wait-and-see attitude. New forces were unable to keep up, and old holdings were sold off, resulting in continued declines. As many as 14 stocks declined. Yongsha rose slightly, closing at 7,120. On Friday, due to the influx of remittances, abundant supply, and extremely loose credit, external material prices rose by 20-30%, and the stock market also saw brilliance, reappearing overall gains. Yongsha rose by 710 yuan compared to yesterday, and the trading volume created a new record of 7.5 billion shares, which shows the enthusiasm of funds flowing into the stock market.</p>
<p>The market opened on the weekend with overall gains again, like a raging fire, and people were extremely optimistic. The stock market has seen three overall gains in one week, which is unprecedented. The reason for this should be the impact of the war and too much currency. Funds from all over the world have come to this city, and the prices of various materials have risen. The multiple of gains in the stock market this year is smaller than that of other materials. Furthermore, this week the authorities restricted the market prices of other materials, which made the stock market, which had been in a long-term trend, soar and rise again and again!</p>
<p>The foreign stock market was unable to trade last week due to the authorities' control, so it is omitted.</p>

<h3 id="e101">Subsistence Allowance Difference for Publicly Funded Students: Political Affairs Meeting Passes 59.8 Billion Yuan, Distributed to Eight Regions, Approximately 1.77 Million Per Student <a href="#e101" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c101" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">101</a></h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing, 11th] The 59.8 billion yuan difference in subsistence allowances for publicly funded students in national schools for June was passed by the temporary Political Affairs Meeting on the 10th. It will still be distributed according to the eight-region standard, averaging 1.77 million yuan per person. This city and Nanjing, Jiangsu, Zhenjiang, Hangzhou, Wuxing, Ningbo, Jinhua, Xiamen, Fuzhou, Jinjiang, Wuzhou, Changsha, Nanyue, Wuhan, Yichang, Jiangling (Shashi), Yongjia, Kaifeng, Huanggang, Nanchang, Jiujiang (Lushan), Hefei, Bengbu, Wuhu, Anqing, Kangding, Xianyang, Pengxi, Zhongning, Pingluo, Guangdong, Henan, Zhengzhou, Wuzhongpu and other places are all listed as the fourth region, with a regulation of 1.8 million yuan.

<h3 id="e102">Students of Private Middle Schools Banned for Not Being Registered: Allowed to Enter Schools with Equivalent Academic Ability, Those with Lower Levels Must Lower Their Grade <a href="#e102" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c102" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">102</a></h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing, 11th] The Ministry of Education has issued an order to the education bureaus of each province and city on the 10th to strictly ban private middle schools that have been operating without registration. Taking Nanjing as an example, there are more than ten private middle schools that have been operating after being approved for registration. There are also many schools in other provinces and cities that have been operating without approval. Because the Ministry of Education has repeatedly issued strict bans, there will inevitably be a large number of private middle schools in each province and city that will be closed after the summer. The academic status of the students who have entered the schools is difficult to recognize because the schools have not been approved for registration. However, it will inevitably affect their future education. Our reporter specially inquired about this matter with relevant parties in the Ministry of Education. According to reports, there are clear provisions in the middle school regulations that junior high schools can enroll 30% of the examinees with equivalent academic ability among all the newly admitted students, and senior high schools can enroll 20% of the examinees with equivalent academic ability. In fact, if the students' test scores are good, in addition to the 30% (junior high school) and 20% (senior high school) standards, the scale can still be appropriately relaxed, and the percentage standard can be increased, which can be determined by each school. Therefore, although the academic status of students in private middle schools that have been banned for not being registered will not be recognized, they can still take the exam with equivalent academic ability, which will not hinder their opportunity to enter schools. However, some students, who originally had lower levels and were not admitted because they applied to other registered private or public schools with higher standards, and then transferred to unregistered private schools; these students must not consider the grade of the unregistered private school they are in and take the exam in order. They must lower their grade before they can be admitted. In addition, the Ministry of Education has also formulated remedial measures for graduates of private schools that were not approved for registration during the Anti-Japanese War and the post-war period due to special circumstances, which are recorded as follows: (1) Private middle schools in the recovered areas that could not be registered because they did not move inland, nor were they registered with the puppet organization, and are now approved, the academic status and graduates of the students before registration shall be reported by the school for retroactive recognition and re-stamping. (2) Private middle schools that have not yet been approved for registration shall be registered within a time limit: those that are not well managed shall be investigated and banned immediately. Graduates who wish to continue their studies shall be allowed to take the entrance examination for public and private specialized schools in the 37th academic year with equivalent academic ability. The above measures are limited to reporting to the Ministry before the end of July this year. However, private middle schools that were approved for registration before the war and did not register with the puppet organization during the occupation and are now continuing to operate shall be investigated by each department and bureau to check the past operating situation, and the qualifications of the graduates of the school during the Anti-Japanese War shall be allowed to be reported.</p>

<h3 id="e109">Statistics on the Development of Education in Taiwan Province: Comparison Between the Japanese Occupation and After the Restoration <a href="#e109" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c109" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">109</a></h3>
<p>[Hualian News Agency Taipei Dispatch] Everyone knows the general progress of education in Taiwan Province in recent years, and everyone knows that the foundation of education in Taiwan Province is very good. During the Japanese occupation, education was very popular. Yes, we can say that when we see those school buildings; but if we study the statistics at that time in detail, we can know that the popularity of education before was limited to the children of Japanese people; the education of our Taiwanese compatriots gradually became popular after the restoration.</p>
<p>National Education</p>
<p>Looking at national education, taking the Republic of China year 31 as an example during the Japanese occupation, the percentage of Japanese children attending school reached 99.59%, while the percentage of Taiwanese school-age children was only 79%. After the restoration, the percentage of Taiwanese school-age children attending school has changed year by year, and the latest statistics have exceeded 80%.</p>
<p>Secondary Education</p>
<p>Looking at the situation of secondary schools, it is even more obvious. In the year before the restoration, the percentage of national school graduates entering higher education was only 8.39%; in the Republic of China year 35, it increased to 22.14%, and in the 36th year, it increased to 33.59%. There was no junior high school before the restoration for junior high school graduates to enter senior high school, so it cannot be estimated; it also increased year by year after the restoration; it increased to 46.51% in the 35th year, and 66.66% in the 36th year. Comparing the number of secondary school students, there were only 42,101 during the restoration period, and there are now 84,630 this year, more than doubling.</p>
<p>Higher Education</p>
<p>As for higher education, the Japanese imposed the highest possible restrictions on the number of Taiwanese youth entering colleges and universities in the province; according to the statistics of the year before the restoration (Republic of China year 33), there were a total of 2,751 students in colleges and universities in Taiwan, and only 548 were Taiwanese; only 5 were in the liberal arts. After the restoration, in the Republic of China year 35, the total number of students in the province's specialized materials and above has increased to 3,129, of which 2,542 are Taiwanese. From this point of view, the future of education in Taiwan Province is still promising.</p>

<p>I. History</p>
<p>The school was founded in February of the state's second year of the Republic of China in Wenjiang Village, Taihe County, Jiangxi Province. It built its own school buildings with a beautiful environment. During the War of Resistance, it enjoyed a high reputation in the southeastern provinces. In May of the 35th year, it moved to No. 66 Dihua North Road (Difeng Road) in this city, temporarily borrowing part of the school buildings from the Municipal Women's Normal School. The school specializes in cultivating teachers for kindergarten normal schools, researching child psychology, and training talent in welfare. High school graduates can apply to the school. After three years of graduation, they will be assigned as kindergarten teachers, kindergarten education teachers in normal schools, and directors of large-scale kindergartens, or engage in work in childcare centers, educational institutions, and other children's welfare organizations. There have been four graduating classes, totaling over one hundred people, working in areas including Sichuan, Guangxi, Taiwan, Jiangxi, Hunan, and cities such as Shanghai and Qingdao.</p>

<h3 id="e115">Baseball League Situation Changes: China Defeats US Army, 5-4, Coming from Behind, Tied for First Place with the Air Force <a href="#e115" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c115" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">115</a></h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The situation in the Ranmating British Navy Baseball League has changed due to China's two victories over the weekend and the US Air Force's loss of its winning streak. China, with four wins in five games, is tied for first place with the Air Force, the team with the highest hopes for the championship. The championship will likely come from these two teams. The US Navy still has strong strength and is the only team that can threaten China and the Air Force. The teams below it have no chance of winning the championship. The recent situation of the league is as follows:</p>
<p>American Offensive Fierce</p>
<p>The Chinese team continued its style from previous games, weakening first and then strengthening, although it was twice on the verge of defeat, it was still able to seize the final opportunity and defeat the US Army by a narrow margin of one point. China responded with a new formation. The American army attacked first. Left fielder Bergern and center fielder Maori dismounted and exerted their power, gaining a second. In the third inning, Bergern once again displayed his old trick, adding another point with Bauer's safe hit, making it 3-0. China quickly reorganized its military strength, appointing Yu Changluan as pitcher, Liang Yousheng retreated to the shortstop position, Liang Youwen guarded third base, Bao Guanwen retired, Maori once again followed Chen Cang's old path, attempting to steal home base, Cao Kejia saw through his treachery and made a wonderful kill, and the Army's offensive gradually subsided.</p>
<p>China Opens Up the Game</p>
<p>In the fourth inning, China counterattacked. After Lu Zhaosen got a free base, he stole to second base. Cao Kejia made a wonderful hit to left field, Zhaosen advanced one step further, and Yu Changluan sacrificed himself, sending Zhaosen back to defense, opening up the game for China.</p>
<p>In the sixth and seventh innings, Yousheng and Youwen each scored one point, tying the score at 3-3. In the eighth inning, US Army shortstop Shano scored a point due to an erroneous ruling by the base umpire, and the US Army once again took the lead. The audience was worried about China, but fortunately, the generals responded calmly. Amidst the cheers and encouragement, Lu Zhaosen hit the ball with his old arm, and the ball flew like an arrow, directly to right field, giving China its first home run since its formation, tying the score again at 4-4.</p>
<p>Winning the Final Victory</p>
<p>In the final inning, the outcome was at stake. China defended tightly, killing three generals, first ensuring no defeat. During the counterattack, He Jinben got a free base, and with Youwen and Yousheng's clever hits, he advanced to third base. When Guan Da wielded his bat, the ball hit the left field, and Jinben rushed back, giving China the final victory. The scores of each inning are as follows:</p>

<h3 id="e116">World Games Delegation Donation: Malaysian Chinese Merchants Break Their Promise <a href="#e116" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c116" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">116</a></h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Singapore, 10th] Several wealthy Chinese merchants in Malaysia, including rubber estate owners, who had previously volunteered to donate funds to our World Games delegation, have now refused to fulfill their donation promises. Sports figures here say that the sudden change in the attitude of these merchants is due to labor disputes, which have created unfavorable situations in the local area, which have greatly affected their business. According to reports from Shanghai, the amount voluntarily donated by wealthy Singaporean merchants and scholars was around US$5,000, for the expenses of our World Games delegation during their stay in London.</p>

<p>Our delegation to the World Games departed in three batches. The last batch of thirteen people, led by Chief Leader Dr. Wang Zhengting, went to Longhua Airport at 5 a.m. yesterday morning to board China Airlines' T-104 Overlord plane to England. The plane took off at 6 a.m., heading straight for Hong Kong, and then transferring via Kunming and Yangon to Calcutta, staying in India overnight, and then taking a British plane to London. In addition to track and field athletes Lou Wenao and Chen Yinglang, the rest of the team were staff members. Also traveling with them were Dr. Wang's wife, Mrs. Hao Gengsheng, Ms. Gao Zi, and the swimming team leader and coach Xu Minhui. Mrs. Hao is representing our country at the Olympic Games Congress to be held in England. According to Dr. Wang before his departure, this is the third time that our country has participated in the World Games. During this time of suppression of rebellion, limited by funding, we were unable to send more athletes, which is deeply regrettable. Fortunately, if we can win one or two points, it will be enough. Fortunately, the most important meaning of participating in the Olympics is to connect international feelings and promote the spirit of sports. Our delegation will work towards this goal in order to live up to the expectations of the people of the country. The list of those who left Shanghai yesterday is as follows:</p>
<p>(Chief Leader) Wang Zhengting, (Secretary General) Ji Shouyi, (Chief Coach) Hao Gengsheng, (Swimming Team Leader) Xu Minhui, (Secretary) Tian Hanxiang, Feng Chenzhen, (Staff) Shi Zhaokang, Lu Xiangqian, (Assistant Staff) Wu Zhigang, (Track and Field Representatives) Lou Wenao, Chen Yinglang, (Companions) Mrs. Wang Zhengting, Mrs. Liang Gengsheng,</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Kunming, 11th] Our country's World Games delegation, a batch of fourteen people, led by Dr. Wang Zhengting, arrived in Kunming at 3 p.m. this afternoon aboard the Overlord plane. After a brief stop, they continued their flight to Calcutta.</p>

<p>[Central News Agency, Singapore, 10th] Our World Games basketball team defeated the Singapore team by a score of 61-33 at the Happy World Stadium here today, achieving a complete victory here. The audience at the scene reached over 12,000, the largest audience ever at Happy World Stadium. Eager to see the World Games team compete against one of the best teams here (the team defeated the Philippine Flying Squad last year), the audience had their eyes opened during this game. At the beginning of the game, the World Games team used its usual lineup, with Li Shiqiao, Wu Chengzhang, Cai Wenhua, Bao Songtu, and Huang Tianxi taking the field. The young and competitive Malaysian Chinese team took the offensive with rapid steps from the beginning, and after a fierce battle in the first quarter, the World Games team relied on the accurate shooting of its center Cai Wenhua, scoring three consecutive goals, to compete with the fast-attacking opponent. At the end of the first quarter, the World Games team was one point behind. In the second quarter, the World Games team still could not resist the rapid offensive tactics of the Malaysian Chinese team. The Malaysian Chinese team prepared for long-range shots in the middle of the field against the World Games team, not willing to fall behind, and gradually caught up. In the first half, the World Games team led 26-25. In the third quarter, Bao Songtu committed five fouls and left the field, but he had already scored nine points for the World Games team. Li Zhenzhong joined the game, and because of his calm handling, the World Games team was able to take an advantage of eleven points, laying the foundation for victory. In the final stage, Li Shiqiao and Wu Chengzhang conducted a two-person offensive, scoring six consecutive goals, creating the climax of the most dangerous ball game since the World Games team left Shanghai at the beginning of this month.</p>

<h3 id="e119">Inside Story of the US Election <a href="#e119" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c119" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">119</a></h3>
<p>— Yu Chuang</p>
<p>There is an American saying: "He who pays the piper calls the tune," meaning that since you have used someone else's money, you should listen to them. This saying is especially suitable for politics. Therefore, the source of campaign funds for presidential candidates is always a deeply hidden secret in the US elections held every four years.</p>
<p>The cost of a US presidential candidate's campaign is a considerable figure. No matter how lofty the candidate's goals or how moving their tone, it would be in vain if no one could hear their speeches. If you want voters to hear your campaign speeches, you have to spend money everywhere. For example, during the last election, Roosevelt broadcast a "fireside chat," which cost $100,000. The Republican Party spent 7,000 yuan in one state alone on advertising at the last minute. This year's costs are naturally much more expensive than four years ago. There are probably 60 million eligible voters in the United States. If you just mail a printed promotional item to each voter, and the postage for each letter is one and a half cents, the postage for 60 million letters alone would be 900,000 yuan, plus printing, paper, and labor costs, the total would be 3 million yuan.</p>
<p>The US Congress has passed a "Hatch Act" to limit campaign spending, stipulating that no "political organization" may spend more than 3 million yuan per year, but everyone still obeys in appearance but violates in reality. The Democratic Party claimed to have spent 2.16 million yuan in the 1944 election, and the Republican Party said it only spent 2.82 million yuan, but according to a survey by Dr. Overlack, a female professor at Wellesley College, both parties cleverly established many organizations similar to their own parties to assist in the election. Therefore, in fact, Roosevelt and Truman's campaign spending that year reached 7.44 million yuan, and Republicans Dewey and Brigg also spent 13 million yuan that year. Dr. Overlack estimates that the total campaign spending for both parties this year will be around 50 million yuan.</p>
<p>Where does this money come from?</p>
<p>Before Roosevelt participated in the election, the campaign funds of the Democratic and Republican parties were paid by the richest wealthy families and the large companies they controlled in the United States. Often the same company would pay two similar amounts, one to the Democratic Party and one to the Republican Party, so the campaign funds of the two parties were often similar. However, when Roosevelt ran for election in 1936, the wealthy families were quite dissatisfied with his New Deal, so the money given to the Democratic Party was greatly reduced. By the time of the second consecutive election of Roosevelt in 1940 and 1944, the wealthy families almost fully supported the Republican Party.</p>
<p>According to the "Hatch Act" mentioned above, each citizen or legal person may not donate more than 5,000 yuan in campaign expenses, but Dr. Overlack said that people who are enthusiastic about helping the election have come up with clever ways to circumvent it, and in fact, they have not been affected at all. For example, the famous arms dealer Dupont once donated 200,000 yuan to the Republican Party in the name of 60 family members. Pew donated 164,500 yuan, but used the names of 12 people. Queeny, the boss of Monsanto Chemical Company, donated 55,000 yuan in the names of three people.</p>
<p>The Democratic Party is different. According to investigations, they have never received donations of more than 10,000 yuan from the same family.</p>
<p>In 1928, half of the Democratic Party's total campaign expenses were supplied by 135 enthusiastic election helpers. Each of these 135 people donated more than 5,000 yuan, and three donations exceeded 100,000 yuan. In the same year, on the Republican side, more than 300 people donated more than 5,000 yuan each. Most of these people were bankers and large manufacturers. The Democratic Party obtained more than 40% of its campaign expenses from this source. By 1944, the situation had changed greatly. Donations from bankers to the Republican Party accounted for 16.7% of the total; the Democratic Party only received 5.2% of the total. Campaign expenses donated by the industrial and commercial sectors to the Republican Party accounted for 24.2% of the total; while those given to the Democratic Party only accounted for 8.1%.</p>
<p>One of the major sources of campaign funds for the Democratic Party is labor unions. In 1936, bankers and industrialists were unwilling to support the Democratic Party, but labor unions came out and replaced them, donating 10% of the total campaign expenses of the Democratic Party; by 1940, labor union donations had increased to 15.9%. In 1944, the "Political Action Committee" in charge of donations and election assistance from the labor union side donated a sum of more than 1.32 million yuan, which caused considerable fluctuations in the political world.</p>
<p>Generally speaking, the Republican Party relies on the help of the "sixty wealthy families" in the United States, while the Democratic Party relies on the support of labor unions; but both parties are also trying their best to raise donations from people with lower incomes. In 1936, the Republican Party appealed to 17 million voters, asking each to donate one yuan to help the election, and as a result, received 400,000 yuan, but the necessary miscellaneous expenses used up about 160,000 yuan; the Democratic Party donated 1 million yuan, which was reduced by 20% after deducting expenses.</p>
<p>Dr. Overlack said that it is a good phenomenon for people to generally donate campaign funds, but unfortunately, it has not exerted its greatest power to this day. Freedom must be paid for, otherwise, "he who pays the piper calls the tune," and the government cannot but take into account the interests of the wealthy a little more.</p>

<p>In Elgin, USA, a school is now trying a white "blackboard" and black chalk, the reason being to reduce eye strain for students. At the same time, the white blackboard matched with light blue walls can make the indoor light brighter. The result of the trial is that not only is everything as expected, but writing "black" on a white "blackboard" can make it easier to recognize words, which can be described as "killing three birds with one stone."</p>

<h3 id="e122">Summer Vacation <a href="#e122" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c122" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">122</a></h3>
<p>— Bao Zhongqi</p>
<p>Like children eagerly anticipating the New Year, with the graduation ceremonies of various schools, students welcome the arrival of this annual summer vacation.</p>
<p>There are still a full two months before the start of school in early September, but this summer is different from previous years, and I think most students have a different and heavy feeling. And the graduating students of this year are busy looking for jobs, so "summer vacation" is meaningless, and there will be no more enjoyment of summer vacation except for "being a teacher."</p>
<p>Therefore, we students who are about to start our careers cannot help but cherish these last few summer vacations, and we cannot help but feel the lateness of our years. This feeling is almost the same as that of grown-up children who do not like the New Year.</p>
<p>I still remember the several summer vacations in elementary school, all of which slipped away in a muddle-headed and indifferent manner. Upon entering middle school, it happened to be the time when the War of Resistance against Japan was rising, and the people on the isolated island suffered. As our age increased and our knowledge grew, we also began to realize that it was not easy for our parents to prepare tuition fees. Every summer vacation, we saw their worries and anxieties on their foreheads. As children, we only quietly did our "summer homework," and there was no leisure to spend our vacations? After the victory of the War of Resistance, we, this lucky group, thought that we would step onto a smooth path from then on and complete our studies more easily, but who would have expected that the problem still plaguing our hearts today is the huge amount of tuition and miscellaneous fees?</p>
<p>We are happy for the students of this year who are "changing consumption into production," and we are even more saddened for the students who are about to drop out of school. We cannot bear to see the young buds of a school wither away without irrigation. We sincerely pray that the newspaper's readers' school assistance movement will be completed as soon as possible!</p>
<h3 id="e123">Beans <a href="#e123" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c123" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">123</a></h3>
<p>— Gongsun Wu</p>
<p>Visiting Longhua, the peach blossoms are not worth watching. Under the flower trees, broad beans are planted everywhere, which are about to bear fruit. Planting beans under trees is something I have never seen in my life. I am afraid that I don’t know much about farming, and I find it quite strange. Tiangong Kaiwu says that broad beans are sown in August and harvested in April of the following year. Under the mulberry trees in western Zhejiang, they are planted everywhere. Generally, things do not grow when tree leaves block them, but when the leaves of these beans and peas are lush, they have already formed pods and borne fruit. "Record this to show my foolishness. I also recall one thing. In the past, a newly arrived American agricultural teacher at a certain university took out a handful of vegetable seeds, saying that they were very easy to grow and could be planted anywhere. He heard that China had insufficient food and frequent disasters, so he brought them to spread them as miscellaneous grains, which would be of some help to the people's food. The students listened respectfully and planted them in the experimental field. When they grew, they turned out to be kohlrabi. They laughed together, but this gentleman's good intentions were indeed admirable, so I will never forget them. In my hometown, this vegetable is called badger vegetable, which is most suitable for feeding pigs. Poor and frugal people occasionally eat it, and it is indeed an easily obtained miscellaneous grain with rich flour, which should not be underestimated. Xu Guangqi's Complete Treatise on Agriculture also speaks about it in detail.</p>

<p>The "Maginot Line" has become a historical term. The French government is now renting out the land around the "defense line" for animal husbandry. The place that used to be full of murderous intent is now "wind blowing grass low, revealing cattle and sheep."</p>
<p>There are currently about 10 million elderly people over the age of 65 in the United States, but only one-tenth of them can retire peacefully and enjoy their old age with their usual savings. The remaining nine-tenths have to rely on other people's help—many people can only continue to work hard for their lives.</p>

<h3 id="e125">Feelings After Reading the Newspaper <a href="#e125" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c125" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">125</a></h3>
<p>— Jinjin</p>
<p>When I opened the newspaper this morning, I suddenly had some feelings. What I noticed was not the major news or headlines in the newspaper, but the newspaper itself. In fact, this feeling should have existed long ago, but it was triggered accidentally today.</p>
<p>What I discovered is that the market price of white paper has risen sharply, while books are often unable to sell at a price. This situation is somewhat strange. What readers want to see are books, not blank white paper, and white paper should be printed into books, which is its proper path. If everyone does not want books and all kinds of printed paper, then what is the use of having so much white paper?</p>
<p>Therefore, under the premise of the depression of the book industry, the sales of white paper should decrease, but it is still so expensive, so many newspapers must have gone into the hands of non-publishing industries. As a result, the publishing industry thinks that paper and printing costs are too expensive and cannot move forward, and those who really love to read also think that the prices of books and newspapers are too high and cannot afford to buy them. As a result, the more newspapers rise, the higher the gap between the publishing industry and readers becomes. And the depression of the book industry seems to have become an exact and immutable fact.</p>
<p>Is there any way to remedy this phenomenon? I think there is. One is for readers to run their own cultural undertakings to reduce the gap between readers and the publishing industry. The second is for the authorities to give priority to the allocation of newspapers to those who are truly dedicated to the publishing industry. In this way, the paper shortage problem may be solved, and cheap spiritual food may be supplied.</p>
<h3 id="e126">Car Prices Rise <a href="#e126" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c126" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">126</a></h3>
<p>— Hong Xian</p>
<p>Car prices have been constantly rising, making it almost impossible for people to travel.</p>
<p>It is said that the price of gasoline is high, so car prices have to rise. It is only natural that public transportation should be included in the price increase, and the reason for this is already very clear. However, if you think about it, there are so many private cars, isn't private enjoyment a bit too much these days? Why not raise their prices a bit more to subsidize public transportation, in order to help the majority of people who cannot afford cars but need to take them?</p>
<p>Taking a step back, if foreign gasoline is expensive, why not extract more domestic oil? If the cost of domestic oil refining is high, why not use gasoline substitutes? I remember that during the war of resistance, many alcohol-powered cars and charcoal-powered cars were used. Why can't they be used again now? If it is for beauty, then we can no longer talk about hardship; if it is to reduce trouble, then we don't need to talk about research anymore. In fact, at present, there are ways, but I am afraid we are unwilling to find them.</p>

<p>— Yu Shou</p>
<p>Chengdu and Beiping</p>
<p>During the war, living in the southwest rear area, every time I went to Chengdu, I would feel "this is also Beiping." Contemporary scholars like to call Chengdu "Little Beiping," but I don't think so.</p>
<p>In terms of historical records, Chengdu is no less than Beiping. There is no need to mention Zhang Yi building the city; just examine the "Biographies of the Money-Makers" in the Records of the Grand Historian, and you will see that Chengdu was already a major economic and cultural city at that time. Beiping, at that time, was probably just a small commandery in Shanggu. In the hundreds of years that followed, after the establishment of capitals by Gongsun Shu and Liu Bei, Chengdu developed sequentially, reaching its peak of prosperity in the Tang Dynasty. The best evidence is Xue Tao. Modern historians often emphasize: using historical materials about the lives of women of servitude in a certain era to infer the level of cultural and economic life in that place and time is often effective. So, aren't the various records about Xue Tao in historical documents enough to explain the prosperity of Chengdu at that time? Beiping only began to have architectural models in the Jin and Yuan dynasties, and only in the Yongle reign did it become known for its complete cultural relics. Although it can be said that it came later and surpassed the former, to "belittle" Chengdu because of this is a historical disorder, which I secretly think is inappropriate.</p>
<p>Why does Chengdu resemble Beiping? In fact, it is only a temporary intuition of those who see it for the first time, and it is not necessarily based on scientific examination. During the Qing Dynasty, Chengdu was a garrison area for generals, and some Banner people settled there. Regardless of diet, language, etiquette, music, clothing, architecture, etc., their living habits gradually penetrated into the residents. The people of Chengdu absorbed it for a long time, digested it, and encountered it again. Therefore, even after the 30th year of the Republic of China, there were still remnants of the prevailing custom to be found. That's all. I have no lofty arguments to make.</p>
<p>If we talk about the climate, Beiping is vast and bright, with no humid clouds in the sky, purely masculine and beautiful, which is very different from Chengdu, which is deep, soft, rainy and humid, and rich. However, they are both darlings of nature, both able to nourish flowers and trees, and flourish fruits and vegetables. In Chengdu, seeing the patrolling sparrows and magpies pecking at grapes, not avoiding people at all, I often think of Beiping—that's all, and I have no lofty arguments to make.</p>
