<h3>限制日本紡織工業　我與盟總未獲協議　顧維鈞向美方申述立場</h3>
<p>本報南京八日電〕關於限制日本工業水準問題，連日由王雲五召集有關各部會研商結果，我國已同意遠東委會所商訂之原則，即日本之工業水準應以一九三〇至一九三四年五年間日人平均生活標準爲準，惟此種生活標準之解釋，我與盟總意見猶未一致，尤其關於日本紡織工業之水準，聞彼此意見距離仍遠。我國主張日本紡織工業應只能保有二百五十萬錠，盟總則應允日本紡織工業可保有一千萬錠，迄尙未商得協議。我國工業界人土頃已提出關於日本紡織工業水準之意見，主張中日關於紡織工業之水準應保持三與一之比例。日本紗錠最多不能超過三百萬錠。中國朝野對於日本紡織工業水準之意見，已由顧維鈞大使吿知美國。據某權威人士吿記者稱，防止日本再從事侵略，非僅限制其軍事工業發展爲應有措施，而對於紡織工業亦應有相當限制，否則日本紡織業，將予中國甚大威脅。</p>

<h3>「我所知道的中共」兩外籍教十脫險後記述</h3>
<p>〔中央社徐州八日電〕上月十九日國軍於豫西泌陽救護兩外籍女敎士事，此間陸總頃已正式公布，此兩女敎士一係美籍胡佛茂（華名），一係加籍榮耀秋（華名），於上月十九日自泌陽被距陳賡部逐出縣城，經國軍羅廣文師救出抵達信陽後，根據目繫共匪罪行，共同發表「我所知道的中共」一文。全文如下：</p>
<p>當中共軍隊第三次到泌陽佔領了縣城以後，情形已和以往不同。他們很快的不經合法手續，派了一個不合法的縣長，開始對稍有積存的人，用殘暴和奴役的方式，掠奪他們，甚至用非刑去拷打他們。不久這種作風就施用到社會的每一階　，連一向是最窮苦的人，也免不了這浩刧。我們會親眼看見共軍用騾馬輓曳的大車運大批搶來的物資到他們的高級司令部去。他們這種野蠻的行爲，顯然是經上級允許的。泌陽經過這一次浩刧之後，今後的兩個月內，將有成千成萬的人，受到釩餓和死亡的咸脅；因爲這些無辜受累的人民，已被共軍搶掠得一無所有了。泌陽給共軍佔領了三個星期之後，全城的每個部門都落在共產黨人控制之下。他們曾官傳說，共產然人主張宗敎自由，但是事實終於作了謊言者的見證。原來他們一向是「言不顧行」的。在最初，我們這些外籍傳敎者並未受到什麼大的阻撓，我們希望這樣平靜的傳敎生活，能在他們監視下繼續下去，但是事與願遠，災禍不久就到我們頭上來了。（下接二版一　）</p>
<h3>華府人士重視援華　認為係遠樂政策新步驟　參眾兩院對援外疑額將有激烈辯論</h3>
<p>〔本報南京八日電〕據權威人士獲悉：關於我改革幣制向美貨款一事，結果如何，將視五億七千萬美元援華案通過後始可見其端倪。五億七千萬美元之使用計劃，我將根據過云所擬之計劃加以擴充，因此項貸款係分期撥付，旦一部分係以物資代替，故決不能用以改革幣制。依專家之估計，中國法幣發行類在去年十一月時為廿八萬億元，再加十二月及今年一月之發行額，總數當在卅五萬億元左右，如有三億至五億美元作為改革幣制基金，則中國幣制之改革即可有充分之準備。</p>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓七日電〕美國政府決心防止中國全面經濟崩潰，準備撥款五億七千萬元作此用途。美國權威人士僉謂國務部長馬歇爾決定提出五億七千萬元之援華計劃，幕後具有國際政</p>
<p>〔合眾社華盛頓七日電〕外交界七日晚訊：政府要求以五億七千萬元援華，顯示美國遠東外交政策之重要新步驟。與此同時，援助日水亦將達一億七千五百萬元，援助朝　將達七千五百萬元，使受戰爭破壞之國家，在經濟上得　康復。</p>
<p>此間外交界認爲援華·援日·援朝鮮三項計劃，顯係國務院在遠東方面建立反共障礙物之新決定。</p>
<p>〔中央社華盛頓七日電〕據今日此間對各方意見之調查，顯示國務院所提十五個月估計用款九三億三千三百三十萬美元之援外新計劃（援華之五億七千萬美元亦包括在內），於本月杪在參衆兩院展開全盤辯論時，將遭遇堅強之反對。共和黨將起而主張削减此項龐大數字，該黨某反對人士曾謂：「美國人民不能忍受此項龐大數字」，惟支持國務院計劃者，則表示希望此項撥款，能在四月一日批准。</p>
<p>〔合眾社華感頓七日電〕馬歇爾計劃修正派領袖參議員惠勒稱：政府提議九十三億三千三百萬援外計劃，美國人民實不堪負担，美國經濟亦不可能考慮此項數字項惠勒稱：參議院修正派代表於七日舉行集會，參院外委會主席范登堡任主席，研討可能之變更。</p>
<h3>經濟改革方案　水利部份實施辦法</h3>

<h3>本年度國家總預算論（上）</h3>
<p>— 張白衣</p>
<p>養民政府因德政行將實施，當前之過渡政府無法擬定本年度之施政方針，故對於本年度國家總預算，僅編製上半年度，即暫以本年一月至六月爲會計年度，其預算數字，乃依照上年度之預算及追加而援用。據行政院張院長本月五日在立法院報吿，及立法院聯席會議審查之結果，發出預算總額爲九十六萬二千七百六十六億零零四十一萬元，歲入預算總額（隊去債款收入，）爲五十八萬三千四百零八億九千六百九十七萬元。吾人僅觀上述預算總額，尙抱相當樂觀，蓋按照本年度歲入總額對歲出總額果能佔百分之六十一以上，由收支平衡原則之觀點言之，不可不謂財政巳漸趨正軌之傾向。</p>
<p>又據申報一月十四日南京專電：「主計處徐主計長及財政部兪部長表示，本年度預算不以通貨膨脹政策彌補虧空額，並儘力使其不再有追加預算。其虧空則擬利用改革稅制及增設救濟特捐彌補。「政府當局如此保證，如果眞能兌現，則謂本年度預算前途之漸趨樂觀，當非過分。</p>
<p>惟吾人對於本年度上半年預算尙有若干前提必須予以考慮者：第一，本年度預算歲出總額九十六兆元有奇是否足以表示戡亂建國財政之眞正意義？第二，本年度預算歲出總額是否果然保證其必無追加預算？第三，租稅徵收及康款出納系統之現行制度是否保證其必無因舞弊而有浪費現象之繼續發生？第四，公債政策是否竟無繼續實行之必要及可能？第五，國有財產收入之微收技術是否有改革之必要？第六，政府歷年累積大量之內國公債是否有澈底整理之必要？依筆者研究所得，欲期我國財政脫離「爲財政而財政」之旣成財政學派舊有思想之束縛，欲期我國財政在此貨幣行將改革前後澈底整理及樹立今後永恒健全之基礎，以及欲期我國政府利用財政力量達到戡亂建國之目的，則對於前述六項問題必須在編製本年度預算時予以特別考慮，從而謀全盤之解決。茲以筆者研究所得，謹將上述六項問題之原因，意義，及其解決之方法，說明及建議如後，以供政府首長立法委員及財政學家作共同研究之資料。</p>
<p>關於第一問題，歲出總額是否具有戡亂建國財政之意義問題。不能否認，我國此時財政固爲戰時財政，同時又須爲建國財政。此與抗戰時期之抗戰建國財政初無分別。戰爭無分內外，財政已爲參加戰爭之一環。回憶英國財政大臣勞合·喬治（David　Lloyd　George,Chanellor　of　The　Exchcquer）在第一次世界大戰時曾有言：「余等將如拿破崙戰時，務須獲得最後勝利於我等財政之實力」。又在第二次世界大戰時，英國財政大臣西門爵士（Sir　John　Siman）作第一次預算演說時亦有名實：「財政爲國防第四種車隊，倘財政一旦失敗，則支持戰爭之全力將立即崩潰」。此足證明財政與戰爭關係之密切及財政在戰爭地位之重要。不有戰事則已，戰則無分內外，此定則必不變。</p>
<p>同時，政府實行建國主要工作之一爲完成國父建國方略中的實業計劃，國民政府蔣主席又在「中國之侖運」一書中依據實業計劃提出十年經濟建設方案。在抗戰時期吾人尙不忘建國，在戡亂時期吾人當更不能遺忘完成實業上的經濟建設。在抗戰期間，正由吾人抗戰建國同時並進，始得持久抗戰，始得最後勝利；値此戡亂時期，其禍患都不亞於日本帝國主義挾傀儡政府侵略中國，故吾人在此時際更須戡亂建國同時並進，庶可打擊第二種傀儡，更險毒可惡的傀儡，庶可持久抵抗新興帝國主義勢力之侵入中國。而完成建國之宇要手段，又須依賴財政實力。例如美國財政學家比倫敎授（Prof．C．C．Plehn）曾在其所著「財政政策論」中認爲「蘇聯財政爲五年經濟計劃之槓桿」。由此可知，財政又爲經濟建設之主要動力。</p>
<p>是以財政，不論其戰爭方面，不論建設方面，均佔有最重要之地位。蓋今日財政決非爲財政而財政，今日之財政應爲富國強兵之財政也。依筆者所知，政府財政政策似有意或無意中受制於俗流經濟學家或政治性經濟學家之批評指摘，常持保守之傾向，故財政政策上所表現者，因循沿襲，即各方敷衍，只有頭痛醫頭，脚痛醫脚。此種傾向必須澈底消除；否則則本年度戡亂工作將不能根本結束，同時苟無外援，或且招致財政本身之困難，從而將影響於整個軍事政治與經濟。茲先將本年度上半年歲出預算總額九十六兆元之一問題研究之。　法幣實際價値固決非如市塲標準之低，但今日物價上昇已達十五萬億，則爲旣成事實。在法幣繼續漫遊市塲不歸銀行爲存款之前，政府大部份支出恐將不得不按此既成事實之物價標準，如以九十六兆元國家總預算換算我國戰前法幣僅約六億元，以此標準而推算全年度則僅爲十二億元。我國戰前預算亦約當此數，但當時戡亂之區城甚小。故舉出認爲此九十六兆元歲出總額有考慮塲加之必要。同時各項主要支出之比率，依筆者計劃，政府欲期本年內給束戡亂工作之重要部分，其軍費必須經增加至佔總歲出百分之五〇；政府欲期本年內實　將主席十年經濟建設方案，其建設費必須增加其佔總歲出百分之二十五；政府欲期本年內提高公敎人員生活費以安定彼等生活及提高行政效率，其公敎人員生活費（武職人員生活補貼費歸入軍事費內）必須增至佔總歲出百分之一〇；政府欲期在本年內償淸一切內債及國內發行之外幣公債，則債看費必須佔載出總　百分之五；其他政　費則佔百分之一〇。故筆者建議之預算及內容當如後：半年歲出總額一百五十萬億元，其中軍事費七十五萬億元，經濟建設費二十萬五千億元，公務人員生活費十五萬億元，其他政　費十五萬億元，債　費（內債）七十五萬億元。軍事費　包括軍餉及作戰物資。敎育費中一切與經濟建設有關者均　人經濟建設費費，債務費　備一次償淸　前戰時及戰後各種債券。（理由詳後）。</p>
<p>吾人必須注意思想作戰在戰爭地位之重要性。提高軍隊生活待遇，可以發揮及增强戰門力量；提高文官生活待遇，可以加强行政效率而减少舞弊現象。</p>
<p>我國在抗戰前夕之民國二十五年，國民政府編製民國二十三年度預算時，爲充實國力起見特擬定五年計劃，籌定建設專款，預算上分普通歲出及建設專款歲出兩種，一如美國在經濟復興期間在預算上分普通歲出及復興與救濟歲出（Generol　Expenditures　and　Recovey　＆　Relief　Expendilures）兩大項目然，當時列建設專款四億元，約佔當時預算總額三分之一。故筆者今提出經濟建設費卅七萬五千億元（換算戰前法幣二億五千萬元），佔總額百分之二五，與民國二十三年度計劃相仿。</p>
<p>或有人謂，此項鉅額預算倘付實行，恐將仍以大量發行爲彌補，且將引起更爲惡性之通貨膨脹。但筆者已考慮及此，比數額並非過鉅，在財源上足可應付，且亦不必依賴發行。此點容後述之。</p>
<p>現在再來看第二問題，即本年度預算是否保證其必無追加預算之問題。我國自抗戰勃發後迄至本年爲止，歷年歲出預算與歷年國庫實支均不能符合，推源其故，爲歷年物價上昇之繼績不　，使政府機關以緊急命令支付數字不斷增加，或則依法在緊急命令後補行追加預算程序，或則在緊急命令撥款收到後不再作此追加程序，以致使國庫實際支出均超出預算甚多。建者不談，即以去年度爲例，去年度預算歲出總額爲九兆三千二百億元，但截至十二月終國庫實際支出達四十兆元，超出約三倍有餘。本年度預算是否可以保證不再有此現象，當以物價是否穩定於今日十五萬倍之標準爲先決條件。據財政部兪部長鴻鈞保證今年度決不以發行爲彌補虧空，此實爲賢明之聲明與諾言，　如不以發行爲彌補赤字，則可以根絕財政府支出與物價上昇通貨膨賬之循環。但筆者認爲僅憑此諾言尙不能達到完美之目的，必須要利用財政對金融之關係儘量發揮吸收遊資控制國民購買力之力量，始能收預期之效果。</p>
<p>此處吾人對於國家行局庫及全國商業行莊之存款問題應有深切之注意。據四聯總處調查，國家行局庫定期存款及儲蓄存款之統計如後：（一）定期存款總額截至去年六月終止爲四百六十三億元，但民國二十六年終有六億八千五百十四萬六千元。（二）儲蓄存款總額截至去年六月終止爲七千二百五十三億元，但民國二十六年終有一億八千八百四十八萬八千元。（三）信託存款總額截至去年六月終爲一千八百四十四億元，但民國二十六年終有二千六百四十五萬八千元。以上總計定期存款（包括信託存款）及儲者存款總額爲九千五百六十億元，迄至去年年終大約在一兆元左右。但此項存款在民國二十三年終有九億元有餘。當時九億元以今日市塲物價換算，約合今日一百三十五萬億元，而且此巨額之存款約合於戰前我國政府全年度之預算額。而今日一實億元法幣之國家行局存款，據算戰前法幣僅等於戰前法幣六百六十六萬元元而已。由此可知，在民國二十六年終，國家銀行及兩局所以控制及利用之存款達九億元之多，此則對於國民購買力之控制，尤爲重要。倘今日國家行局庫能有一百三十五萬億元法幣（即相等於戰前法幣存款九億元）之力量，則對於國民購買力之控制當具絕大的效力。今非昔比，由此顯然可見。換言之，今日國家行局庫業已失去銀行機能，對於國民購實力祇只望洋興　，無可奈何！</p>
<p>同時吾人要來看全國商業行莊存款。據中央銀行發表，截至去年九月份止定期存款僅四千一百七十一億元，活期存款則爲二萬四千二百十八億元，以上合計爲二萬八千三百八十九億元。截至去年年終，定期存款估計爲八千億元，而以十五萬倍物價換算戰節法幣則僅爲五百三十三萬元而已。但在民國二十六年終商業行莊在國家行局之同業在款已有六億五千二百萬〇一萬五千元。</p>
<p>吾人依據上述國家行局庫及全國商業行錢莊之定期存款（包括儲者及信託存款）數字，在民國二十六年年終共計有十五億五千二百萬元，在民國三十六年終實際僅有一千二百萬元（按照市塲物價，換算戰前法幣），其間低落之倍數約爲激落一二九·五倍亦即民國三十六年終定期存款價額尙不及民國二十六年終定期存款總額千分之八。</p>
<p>吾人倘以抗戰初期之民國二十六年終公私行莊定期存款總額十五億五千二百萬元為標準而以今日市場物價換算今日法幣，則今日公私行莊定期存款額應有二百三十二萬八千億元，但事實所示，僅爲一萬四千一百七十一億而已。此一事實，足以證明今日全國金融機關，不問國家行局，亦不問商業行莊，完全失却原有之銀行機能。今日所謂大量遊資作祟，實際就是銀行存款大量由銀行中逃避而漫遊市塲之結果現象，初非所謂遊資也。同時，亦可證明今日物價之上昇，不能完全歸罪於發行，蓋今日中央銀行發行額亦決無此數也。</p>
<p>財政部為執行國家總預算之機關，當本年度預算業已開始之現在，對於比一事實必須加以特別重視，而且對此問題，尤須立即實施針對現實之政策及辦法，而作有效之解決。如此，始可使本年度預算不再有由緊急命令支付書之繼續出現，如此，始可停止追加預算，如此，始能控制本年度預算。</p>
<h3>我所知道中共</h3>
<p>〔上接一版〕那個面目猙獰，心地毒狠的非法縣長，親目來到授們的敎堂，並且一直衝進了我　的臥室，用專制者的命令口吻，要我們立刻離開泌陽，但是要知道在共產黨區域裏，一個人如沒有他們的「護照」，是「步也不能動的，外國人是更難了。當時他只允許給我們一個「路行證」，這「路行證」並無任何特殊保護的効力，僅在上面說明了我們被逐的理由，「這祇是他們的埋由」。一月十九日早晨來了兩三個共產黨政府人員，檢查我們所能携帶的有限的行李，强迫我們在正午動身。那時，我們從別人口中知道一個可怖的消息，共產黨人預備在我們出城後，在路上把我們活埋，同時我們又得到一個消息說，國軍已到了離城不遠的地方，共產黨的非法縣長派人來迫我們動身，但那些爲我們進行李的人，故意拖延時間，當然他們也知道國軍快到的消息。直到下午三時，我們一切準備安當，正要動身的時候，忽然聽到城外起了槍聲。這是國軍到了泌　的信號。這時應輪到我們看共　黨的把戲了。共軍四處亂跑，想尋個地方來藏起地們的狐狸尾已，後來那個非法縣長和埋伏在城外要活埋我們的壞人，都被國軍活捉了。我們感謝上帝光軍萬能，使我們得到拯救。國軍進城　到了我們？全城民衆的熱烈歡　，那種眞摯熱烈的情緒，勝過日本投降時內心的愉快！我們獲救以後，大家都勸我們暫時離開這不平靜的地方。第四兵　司令　將軍，同意我們　軍隊到確山去。我們和軍隊一同走了五天，得到軍隊禮遇與協助。這又部隊的官兵都很苦，在冰天雪地裏行動，有些兵士兵沒有鞋襪，有的時候糧食也接濟不上，但是軍隊的官兵仍是忠實的履行政府給他們的命令；不論走到什麼地方，官兵們對老百姓是這樣的有禮貌都是公買公賣，絕不損老百姓的一點利益。我們誠心祈　予共宜黨以打擊的部隊將士們，健壯勝利</p>

<h3>日政局急轉直下　片山內閣定今晨總辭職　各黨派可能組聯合內閣</h3>
<p>〔新亞社東京八日電〕日片山首相因欲統一社會黨內部，昨日即已決定實行內　總辭職，但未曾獲得各大臣之同意，而延期今日努力說服各大臣之結果，遂決定於明（九）日午前九時舉行最後之閣議，正式表明內閣之總辭職。</p>
<p>〔新亞社東京八日電〕日政局今日以念轉直下之勢，打破數日來之沘亂局面，片山內閣已宣佈總辭職，至此，就下屆內閣問題頗爲一般觀察家所注意，所謂第二次片山內閣及自由，民主，兩黨主流聯合內閣之產生，其可能性極微。以目前情勢推測，可能出現者有所謂各黨派聯合之舉國一致內閣：（　田任首相）中央新黨內閣（　田任首相）及救國保守新黨內閣（吉田任首相）三種內閣。惟因此三種內閣均將擯社會黨於閣外，故此組織工作亦頗困難，就綜合各黨派所屬議員對次期政權工作之態度觀之，支持各黨派聯合舉國一致內閣者，以民主黨佔最多數九十五名，國協黨三十六名，全農派在可能條件內，十六名，第一議員俱樂部約八名，農民黨七名，無所屬議員五名，共計一百五十九名。若社會黨不分裂而全體支持此種內閣，則共有二百八十二名。即令左派分裂除去五十名外，亦達二百三十二名。足以控制現議員總數，四百四十六名之過半數。其次中央新黨內閣，除蘆田新黨直系外，民主黨之脫出黨份子約二十名，其他小會派即與第一俱樂部同樣支持之。又社會黨從不裂，而左派業已表明不支持之態度，故其支持勢力，約二百二十三名，適占現議員總數之半數，此爲最大限度之數字。而全農第一，農民等諸派中，尙有十名左右，成爲疑問。至於救國保守內閣以自由黨全體一百十九名，同志俱樂部全體二十二名爲中心，民主黨參加者約四十名，全農·農民·兩派在可能條件丙，全體參加。第一議員俱樂部八名，無所屬一名，合計二百十三名，綜合觀之，諸黨派聯舉合舉國一致內閣之可能性最大，中央新黨內閣次之，吉田首班之救國保守新黨內閣之實現性，似較微弱，惟若社會黨左派分裂而採取獨自之行動，則此二三者之支持勢力，皆不過一百二三十名，而由小會派之去就，吉田首班內閣之出現可能性，反爲最大，以此觀之，政局之關鍵，現握諸社會黨左派掌中，因而片山內閣總辭職後之次期政機之歸趨亦在於左派之態度與其團結之如何也。</p>

<h3>中東建防共促堡壘　杜魯門主義應擴至伊朗　眾院外交小組提出建議</h3>

<h3>美物價趨跌原因　五豰跌價市場百貨下落　各國幣值變動亦具影響</h3>
<p>〔中央社紐約七日電〕各國對美國物價趨勢咸極注意，故各地注意之點「爲最近之日來美國物價及股票之突跌，是否爲美國經濟崩潰之先兆」。目前對此事之影影，作確定之斷語尙嫌過早，但多數財政專家，認爲此乃美物價鬥爭中一項良好之調度，而並無不景氣之光。一般商人多認爲物價跌落，可產生心理上之力量，而防止物價不再上漲。按美國最近物價跌落實有甚多之經濟理由。自供應方面而言，歐洲南美及美國糧食生產情形大有進步，去年十二月因賦稅問題而囤積五穀之美國農民，因恐物價繼續下跌而拋售其存貨，同時商業方面之供求已逐漸趨於平衡。自需要方面而言，僉信國會將减低援歐物質，同時五毅價格較肉價爲高，故牲畜糧精之需要，因消費者之拒購而减少。五穀價格，亦因牲畜糧糈减價而跌價。物價下跌亦受英國之自動凍結工資與利潤計劃，以及蘇，義，法各國改定幣値之影響。若干觀察家認爲物價之大波動，足以在經濟上表明通貨膨脹，恐已達飽和狀態。此種跌價趨勢，對美國實爲有益而非危險。美國高昂之生活費，將因此下跌，而使多數之美貨，可供應他國。同時若美國物品减價事，得吿實現則工會將無法謂生活費用高漲，而要求增加工資。美國第三度因要求增加工資而罷工之成脅，將大形减少。某財政專家並認爲美國今年盡全力生產一舉，將大有裨益於匡正通貨膨脹之情形。先鋒論壇報認爲農作品跌價一事，定可使股票跌價，蓋所有商人之行動，多少受有形無形之心理影饗，農作品跌價，將使零售糧食跌價，而零售糧食之跌價，又將使工業品跌價，以此觀之，股票及貨物之跌價將爲一種調節作用，而不致產生擾亂市塲之影饗。</p>
<h3>西德新憲章　今日起生效</h3>

<h3>南韓局勢仍嚴重　有組織暴動使全境騷亂　韓人百五十名遭逮捕</h3>
<p>〔中央社漢城八日電〕昨日竟日南韓全境所發生之暴動，今晨似已趨於沉靜，但美軍與韓警對新騷亂之發生，仍持戒備。韓暴徒與韓警昨日曾發生激烈衝突，有韓人十名至十三名及韓警四名聞已喪命，警方報吿稱，另有警察七名，暴徒三名受傷，並有警察二名爲暴徒所綁刧，警方已逮捕韓人百五十名，刻正加以鞫訊中。據稱：昨日南韓全境所發生之事件，共達百零五起，包括騷亂破壞性行動，示威運動及罷工，似爲極有組織之暴動，騷亂特甚之地爲釜山海港與大邱兩處，據稱：該兩地之南韓勞工黨（共黨之後身）之勢力頗盛，破壞行動之結果，使爲數約五十至六十一輛之間之火車機車，因部份機器遭搬走而受破壞，電話綫及運輸路綫已於多處遭截斷。昨日漢城尙相當靜謐，右派報紙之「東亞日報」，遭暴徒攻擊，但僅微有損失，此間一美軍哨兵，昨夜曾遭韓人投以石子，但哨兵鳴槍一響，即將暴徒驅散，蘇方控制下之平壤廣播電台利用南韓之騷動，於昨夜廣播稱，南韓全體人民業已起而抗議聯合國赴韓代表團矣。</p>
<h3>赫爾回憶録（五十）</h3>
<p>— 北美報業聯合會版權所有　本報編譯室</p>
<p>秋季是歐洲最危險的季節</p>
<p>羅斯福總統同意在一九三九年七月十八日的晚上，召集參院兩黨領袖在白宮舉行會議。在這次會議中，總統和我，擬爲支持（取消中立法案中軍火禁運—編輯人新聞服務社）法案而作最後的呼籲，如吿失敗則將以法案不得通過後所發生之事態，使反對派負其責任。總統和我，都覺得我們必須做一次最後的和最大的嘗試，俾使參院領袖充份認識淸楚一點，就是假如戰爭在歐洲發生了，我國前途的危險是如何嚴重。　當會議在總統樓上的書齋中開始舉行的時候，表面上似乎頗爲融洽，但是內心的情緒是緊張的。在出席者中，有副議長茄納，多數黨領袖巴克萊，畢德曼，少數黨領袖麥克那利，少數黨副領袖奧斯汀以及外交委員會少數黨員巴拉（Wiliam　E．Borah）。</p>
<p>總統在開始討論時首先提起參議員那埃的極端狐立主義見解，說明這種見解正在阻撓我們的辦法在參院中獲得通過。巴拉相當快地打斷了總統的說話，把兩手一揮，說，「還有別人，總統先生」。總統多少有點驚訝，轉過來問他說，「你說什麼，巴拉參議員」？於是巴拉又說一遍，「還有別人，總統先生」。繼而總統和巴拉兩人就對談了一番，當時巴拉竭力反對取消軍火禁運並且努力表明他的見解，就是說至少在最近將來，戰爭不致發生。</p>
<p>於是總統轉過來對我說，「柯吉爾，你以爲前途危險的可能性如何」？</p>
<p>我儘量抑制自已的感情，懇切地回答說，「假如巴拉參議員能够看見送到國務院來的有關國際局勢極端嚴重的電報中的幾個，我將因他修正他的見解而引爲滿意」。</p>
<p>於是巴拉就用着力和絕對無可變更的語調說，他從國外有消息可得，根據他的判斷，這些消息使他滿意的。這就是說，在最近將來，歐洲不致發生戰爭。他意思彷彿說，這個消　比國務院所接到的，更爲可靠。</p>
<p>最近我注意到發表了一些東西，內容據說是關於巴拉參議員對這次談話的備忘錄。我不想討論當時談話的確鑿字句，但是我必須說明一點，就是巴拉的文字，在我的頭腦中對於當時的情形造成一種確定不移的觀念，猶如我方才講過的。羅斯福總統也表明過不止一次，認爲他從巴拉的說話中，也獲得同樣的觀念。</p>
<p>在我已往的經驗中，從來沒有發覺過如此難以抑制自己的感情如此難以避免感情不自然而然的發作的。從國務院堆得高高的大量官方文件中，我知道巴拉澈底錯誤；我們很現實地看到大戰總爆發的迫切危險，可能在夏末之前到臨—並且我的確這樣說的。巴拉聲言對私人方面的消息比對國務院的消息更爲重視，乃是對我們整個外交工作的一種誹謗。</p>
<p>在兩黨其他領袖一致表示見解，認爲取消禁運無法在國會獲得通過之後，總統轉過來問我說：「柯吉爾，你對於局勢怎樣看法？」　在巴拉對我自己以及國務院表示意見之後，我的感情已經到了發作的邊緣了。當我回答總統的時候，我情緒上的激動大致並沒有隱藏起來。我說，「在巴拉參議員隨便將國務院所有的全部事實推在一邊這種情形之下，我簡直不曉得怎樣想法，而我們所有的事實，是完全否定他認爲戰爭不致於發生的理論的·」我如此深信危險就在眼前，並且對於漠視一切事實和思考的無禮態度是如此憤慨，要我再說下去而又不失却自制，簡直不可能。　午夜，當會議在這種氣氛中，結束之後，白宮就發表了兩個公報。第一個說明出席的民主黨和共和黨議員一致的意見就是說在國會這一屆會議中，對中立法採取任何行動不能實現，但是此事可以在國會下一屆會議中考慮。另一個說：「總統和國務卿維持確定的立塲，認爲參院不能在目前採取行動，則歐洲新危機苟於現在與明年一月間發生時，美國爲在其他國家中維護和平而運用其潛勢力的這種領導權，將被削弱。」</p>
<p>僅僅在五星期之後，我們就必須運用這種勢力，以謀爲防止歐洲戰爭而作最後的努力。在希特勒看來，我們的勢力無疑已因國會拒絕追隨政府的領導而被削弱，同時他相信英法不能從美國獲得武器，藥彈或飛機，也是我們的勢力被削弱的一個原因。</p>
<p>在會議一結束之後，參議員巴拉向我否認在任何方面有損傷我或者我官方立塲的體面之意，參議員麥克那利巴也跟着他這樣表示。但是要在損傷了我所領導向國務院的體面之後而致歉意，是不可能的。我冷冷地接待這輩否認者。我承認巴拉具有最好的用意，但是我被迫說他是如此感情用事，以致思想不淸。</p>
<p>我曾時常邀請巴拉到國務院來，因此我可以把我國駐歐亞各地的外交代表團所發來的消息給他看，並且和他討論國外的一般局勢，但是他從來沒有屈駕過。假如在討論中立問題時他能够到國務院來，我能够給他看些什麼呢？在其他幾十份的參考費料中，還有這幾種：</p>
<p>我國駐柏林代辦堪克在五月十三日打電報給我，說明許多其他國家的外交代表雖然並不預料德國會對波蘭立即採取行動，但是對於避免衝突的機會，極爲悲觀。柏林外國軍界人士的一般印象，認爲德國在軍事上能够隨時向波蘭採取行動的。六月二十四日，堪克報吿說，有關德國境內出乎尋常的軍隊移動以及不斷的軍事活動的種種謠言，已經造成一種普遍印象，就是德國爲某種事變已在進行準備了。</p>
<p>五月十六日，蒲立特大使從巴黎打電報來，說達拉第已表示意見，認爲和平或許可能度過六月，但是他在整個看法上並不樂觀。一個月之後，蒲立特打電報來說，龐納外長曾經吿訴他，以爲德國雖不致立即發動侵略，但是他確信在夏末之前必有一重大危機。六月二十八日，蒲立特把波蘭駐法大使的意見用電報打來，以爲戰爭將在八月中旬在波蘭和德國之間發生的可能性，是百分之八十。六月三十日，備立特把法國外交部要員賴傑的信念用電報打來，以為在八月中旬，一種性質最嚴重的危機是無可避免的。</p>
<p>五月三十一日，波蘭大使卜托基對我說，希特勒在未來數月中將被迫在某方面採取某種步驟。六月二十六日，卜托基通知我說，他的國家正在加緊作戰準備，以防德國發動戰爭。我向他表示意見說，歐洲的情形並不佳妙。凶險的徵象和情形，出現得愈來愈多。遲平—沒有一個人能够說什麼時候—在歐洲如此高度配合在戰爭基礎上的情形之下，極嚴重的事情極可能發生，除非同時能做一些事情使其避免。</p>
<p>六月二十七日，肯奈蒂大使從倫敦把哈里法克斯的見解用電報打來，說明德國情形極爲浮躁，在下月底之前發生困難的機會很大。七月五日，肯奈蒂打電報來說，哈里法克斯吿訴他英國正在召集船隻和海軍人員的後備隊，表面上是準備在八月間舉行演習，但是實際上是想在困難到臨的一個月前使海軍有所準備，當時假定困難將發生於九月間。　六月三日，我國駐海牙代辦報吿荷蘭海軍參謀長弗斯德納海軍上將的意見，認爲希特勒可能在八月中旬至月底間在完成收割之後從事戰爭。弗斯德納並且提起德國方面正在儘速收割農作物，此點已爲荷方所知悉。　此外，我們從我國駐國外外交代表團不斷接到有關歐洲發展的報告，說明德國正繼續對波蘭施用壓力，並爲掌握但澤而做出各種姿態，同時還說明立即發訂英蘇協定的種種困難，雖然英國外交數年來一直爲此一目的而努力。　所有這些消息，巴拉和他的同道是可以看見的，假如他們要看的話。但是巴拉却情願去信賴倫敦一家次要的新聞社；猶如後來傳出來給人知道的。　這裏是美國强有力的孤立主義運動最後一次有力的掙扎，官用一切可能方法繼續作戰而依然是一種危機。但戰爭在歐洲爆發之後，它就不再能阻撓政府任何一個建議了。　沒有一個人能够肯定地說，我們未能取消軍火禁運乃是希特勒最後決定一戰的一個最後的，或者甚至是重要的因素。但是我確信，假如軍火禁運能於一九三九年五月，六月，甚至七月取消，他必然會把這個因素估計在內。我同樣相信我們未能取消禁運鼓勵了他向前猛進，此外里賓特洛甫外長又保證英國和法國不能眞正援助彼蘭，縱使援助，它們也不能十分有效，因爲美國不能以物質援助給予它，此點對希特勒也是一種刺激。七月二十日，蒲立特從巴黎發電給總統，說明倫敦和巴黎方面的意見，都認爲希特勒決定在八月發動戰爭的可能性，已因國會延緩對中立法採取行動而見增加，英國副外相望西泰德以爲戰爭將在八月間發生，正以二對一打着睹。</p>

<h3>還鄉客排隊買車票　長蛇陣漸成迴龍陣　北火站擠得水洩不通　經常保持十萬人紀綠　路警憲兵通宵服務取巧作弊防不勝防</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕廢曆年在國人的生活上，習慣上，是那麼根深蒂固，好像永遠廢不了。旅居在滬的外鄕遊子，誰都需要回鄉度歲，與家人作一次珍貴的團聚，兩路局憑以往經驗，早作了準備，如兩綫增開還鄉列車，原有各次客車加掛車輛，但是還應付不了擁擠的旅客。前昨兩天北站所售出兩綫各站的車票，共達十萬多張，比平時吐納量總數，多百分之四十以上。尤其是每天下午八時以後，北站總是被還鄕旅客擠得水洩不通，偌大的一座三四等候車室，容納不下摩肩接踵的旅客，後來者祗好在門口排隊，單人行列太長，旅客自然而然地把一字長蛇陣改變爲摺疊式的迴龍陣，大應亦被擠得滿坑滿谷。從大門軋到售票處短短的數十碼，至少要費時二十分鐘。據非正式的估計，前昨兩天下午七時至午夜一時，北站全站經常保持十萬人的紀錄，其中包括送客的，買票的和上車的。</p>
<p>買　不到票的旅客，急中生智，擁到第四號窗口，購張月台票，混進車廂，準備補票，於是各次列車的趁客大大地超過了原定限額。雖然月台票立即被停止出售，但是還有不少趁軋票口路警的視綫轉移的一剎那，跳過鐵柵，溜進月台，人太多了，實在防不勝防。</p>
<p>趁　車軍人的數目也比率增加，軍憲警聯合辦公處自然格外難於應付，前晚一位姓孔的軍官，帶了妻兒要去鎭江，到聯合辦公處請了半價票出來，兒子被擠失了，妻子急得流淚，報吿了警務段，好易容路警替他尋回兒子，回頭又不見了妻子，急得他雙脚亂跳，大呼大呌，吵着向站長要人。一位尼姑穿了寬大的僧衣，也來軋車票，在人叢中擠來擠去，累得滿頭大汗，胸前大襟忽被一位孔武有力的旅客撕碎了一半，要拉住他交涉，早已不知去向，祗好自認晦氣。</p>
<p>許多旅客不願擠軋的，都預備在年初幾天回去，所以路局原定自廢曆年初一起减少班次，以便終年辛勞的機務人員，有一二天輪流休息，這計劃恐怕也因此要改變了。</p>
<p>問訊處特別忙，這幾天値夜班的施克敏小姐，不斷地爲旅客解答各種問題，把喉矓都喊啞了。局長陳伯莊與副局長兼運務處處長謝震前晚親自到站巡視，看到如此情形，決定臨時加駛不定時客車，關動所有車倆，載送兩綫剩餘旅客。昨天午夜十二時半，晨二時，晨六時與長一時，增開臨時專車至無錫，常州，南京及杭州各一列，但是每一列車的最大載運量不過二千五百人，因爲還鄕旅客們的行李，都很沉重，影響列車的載量，爲了　到安全，絕對禁止旅客　登車頂，警務處的路警與駐站憲兵，亦通宵服務。</p>
<h3>新念秧　情節曲折　塗改支票上數字　安裕莊被騙巨款</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕市上近發現塗改支票，被馴一億六千萬元之新念秧案，經過情形頗爲曲折。係有大發食品公司近向茂昌股票公司收　一筆，數目爲一百六十五萬元，茂昌當即開一安裕錢莊六日支票一紙，如數付給。大發公司收賬員徐寄巖取票後，行經大樓扶梯旁時，適遇身穿絲絨袍子之男子一人，聲稱渠有現款，願換取該張支票。徐不疑有他，且當面點款，亦未有缺少。交換後，該男子即離去。</p>
<p>迨至昨日安裕錢莊結賬時，以茂昌賬目透支過巨，詢問究竟，始發現六日所付之一百六十五萬元已一變而爲一億六千萬，乃投報黃浦警分局，傳訊大發公司職員，始悉當時交換票據之經過情形，再將原票檢驗時，發現讀者係將該票用「退色靈」抹去後，再用墨筆重寫巨數。而錢莊一時失察，竟致受馴。該案現正由該局派員偵查中。</p>

<h3>美粉十九萬包　運轉華北救濟　各外輪紛運物資到滬</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕福來輪船公司經理之華盛頓號，六日自美運來麵粉十九萬包，現正起卸中，該項麵粉係中信局報裝，爲救濟華北之用。又寳隆洋行泰都克號，預暹羅遝來食米四千噸，預計今日到滬，停靠南市開灤碼頭起卸，該項食米係交通部儲運局報裝。此外順亨洋行斯梯林凡爾號，自紐約裝來汽油一萬七千飲桶，潤滑油二千餘件，紫銅絲七百餘件，以及雜物等共四千餘噸，該輪預定明日（舊曆元旦）抵滬。大英公司之棉花船，係自加爾行答運來，明日或可到埠。</p>

<h3>政府革新具有決心　深盼中美加強合作　張嘉璈在美商會年會演講</h3>
<p>上海美商會於前晚舉行第二十九屆年會，中央銀行張總裁嘉璈應邀蒞會演講，歷時三十分鐘。張氏首對我國社會經濟環境加以分析，說明祗須吾人把握時機，利用厚生，並參以友邦之援助，必可順利完成革新計劃，最後寄語在華美商，深盼能相互切實合作。茲將張氏講詞刊載如次：</p>
<p>從此次年會中，吾人回憶貴商會二十九年來，對本市及我國之供獻，已有顯著之成就，諸位之進取心及從事企業之精神，使余深信在吾人携手爲國家建設而努力之途徑上，將獲得一更重要之助力。歷史係累積人類之智　與奮鬥而形成，由於諸位帶來之近代思想與和平競爭的精神，在中國已產生良好收獲，惟歷史之演進並非盡如吾人理想之順利，其問曲折起伏，在所難免，顧縱有挫折，吾人亦斷不可對於進步與眞理之勝利，有所懷疑。中國自有歷史以來，每數百年更易朝代，每數十年發生內亂，經一次破壞，大者一·二·十年，小者四五年，又漸漸</p>
<p>恢復元氣，蓋以無組織個人主義之農村社會，一則無集中生產工其之足以破壞，二則每一個人均能發揮其充分之精力，三則地域廣大，交通不便，其戰爭之破壞，祗及於一部，四則生活程度低下，人民勇於耐苦·此次第二次大戰，中國得到盟邦的援助，尤其美國的種種犧牲，加上中國軍民的奮鬥，幸以極小量的準備，得到勝利，實則上述的各項因素，仍不失爲戰勝之重大原因，余深信今日雖遭遇極嚴重的困難，而積極的中國人民之恢復力量，消極的自然條件之抵抗力量，均足以防止全體崩潰及縮短恢復時日，此短期間之阻礙，吾人如有勇氣克服之，當不足爲患。雖然，今日情况之嚴重，</p>
<p>不可忽視，中國自經八年抗戰後，又生內亂，因之向所未有之通貨膨脹，加諸國民頭上，而造成目前內戰之武力，係含有世界性而更具澈底破壞性，不特欲澈底破壞一切已有之生產工具，交通工具，同時欲毀滅一切個人之自由精神，及自發力量，並利用有煽惑力量之主義宣傳，以拙毀中國之舊有社會報織，及傳統觀念，即將中國人民所具有之自由恢復力量，及自然條件所具有之抵抗力量，一一摧毀，將使通貨膨脹，</p>
<p>無法遏止，更使恢復增加困難，在此種狀况下，欲使本身抵抗力量增加，並縮短戰後恢復時日，不得不有賴於外助。無論國家社會個人，非有强有力之勁敵，不能得到進步，今日之共產威脅，正予國民政府與一般民衆以極大之刺激，以往軍政機關及民衆之不講組織，不講效率，今非改進效率，澈底廉潔不可。以往重視都市，忽視鄕村之觀念，今日非更改爲雞設農村，提高農民生活程度不可。以往一般上層階級之偏重物質享受，今後非講平等享受不可。以往軍隊之無紀律行動，妨礙政治，輕視民衆，今後非軍政配合軍民一體不可。國民政府果能健全，使共產方面知中國民衆不可以力勝，則共產黨必有</p>
<p>拋棄武力之一日。因無論任何國家社會與個人非有先進者並肩動作，切磋觀摩，不能增加進步速度。今美國援助之先決條件爲被援助國家之自助，此爲促進後進國家進步之最大動力。中國人民個性向偏重個人主義，抗戰以來，與列强並肩作戰，深得同盟國之援助，在國家方面，更覺對於國際合作，熱誠擁護，而人民方面，因有抗戰時代之美國將士之散播各地，故人民間之關係，已增密切，但此不過爲情感的，而尙未達到實際工作上配合之程度。今若美援成功，則可趁此增進實際工作合作之程度，而使政府迅速</p>
<p>刷新改革，並使全體人民在實際工作上，獲得眞正合作之機會，故余以爲今日中國所遭遇之困難，及美國所將担負之犧牲，實可予今後數十年中國革新重建之最大帮助，一切成敗，在乎吾人如何把握此時機而利用之。　張院長對於美國之援助，爲求配合援助效用起見，有改革內政十點之宣示，並已通知美國政府，此十點計劃包括：（一）管理並調節政府支出。（二）改善稅制及其行政。（三）改善公務員及軍官士兵之待遇，並提高工作效率。（四）管制日用必需品之供給，防杜投機，操縱物價。（五）盡力雞立一種使幣制趨於穩定之基費。（六）改善銀行與信用制度。（七）推廣轍出。（八）改善進口貨之管制。（九）改良土地制度發展農業生產。（十）恢復交通及重要工礦業。此十點計劃之重要，不言可喩，深盼切實有具體的辦法，一一見諸實施，敢信政府已</p>
<p>抱有決心因知政府已對每項原則，擬有詳細實施計劃矣。十點計劃中，最基本者尤爲預算收支差額之减少，中國國庫收支，在民國成立以來，向來在五成以上，抗戰前减到十分之三，現達十分之七，希望藉張院長，兪部長之力，能盡量减低收支差額。惟在目前情形之下，欲减低收支差額，並非易事，必須從軍費及其他支出嚴格管理着手，同時要改進稅務行政及其制度。但欲停止通貨膨脹，吾人面臨之困難仍多，依照今年上半年公佈之預算，其他收支差額，約達百分之五十，余不僅期望上半年之預算不再追加，同時更盼望能藉美國之援助，及內政之革新，使下半年之預算差額</p>
<p>更見減少　茲有一事可向諸位告者，即政府計劃一部份已見諸實施，例如；爲避免信用膨脹，國家行局已實施緊縮放款，以防資金流入囤積居奇，並在各大城市成立金融管理局，　杜資金流入投機，操縱黑市。上海並試行食糧，食油燃料，食糖配售，以期逐漸推行於其他各城市，近且計劃五大都市食糧全面配給，以期公平分配，幷改訂花紗管理辦法，由政府供給棉花，採用代紡代織辦法，以防止價格狂漲，對於進出口貿易及外匯管理政策，業已修正，由於外匯平準基金委員會主任委員陳光甫氏之努力，五個半月中，收入出口外匯，已近七千萬美元。同時由於輸出入管理委員會副主任委員李銘氏之努力，對貿易管理已有極大之成就，今該會在霍寳樹氏主持之下，當能更見進步，同時因香港政府之合作，有海關協定之簽訂，及財政協定一部份之實施，今後走私當可减少。但一切管制在中國尙係</p>
<p>初步實行缺乏有經騐之人才，難望其盡如理想。由於外匯供給有限，不能滿足輸入及廠商之希望，同時更由於外匯黑市不能消滅，國內物價高漲，更不能滿足出口商之願望。環顧目前國內情形，當然尙不能令人完全滿意，吾人必須盡更大之努力，加以改善，一部份困難，可以即時克服，一部份必須從根本解決。前者如信用放款之限制，必須配合生產計劃，使必要工業仍可獲得所需要之資金，同時要排除軍隊千涉及運輸之障礙。後者如外匯及貿易之管理，須待幣制穩定後，始能</p>
<p>步入常軌　又如進口限額分配中，對於原料與機器之進口，必須與國內生產相配合。至於管理主要物資如棉紗棉布等，必須於管制之中，不妨礙私人企業之發展。綜上諸端，皆常前應行之急務。尙有一者，各友邦商工業家之在中國經營者，總覺中國政府，一再宣示，歡迎外資，而往往口惠而實不至，實則政府均具熱誠，祗以外匯不足，故一則對於外商廠家之原料與機件需要外獲之供給不能充份，致工廠不能如理想之發展。二則在中國所得餘利；無法匯回本國，致投資者裏足不前。三則進口商之有悠久歷史，有優良服務者，不能得到充分配額，有時不免</p>
<p>相形見絀第一點想從工廠之生產計劃，以決定其應用料件之多寡。第二點希望美國援助成就，外匯較爲充裕時，規定適當辦法，以解決之。第三點若進口原料機件憑生產計劃分配，則有較優之服務條件者，自必能多得交易，盼望逐步能達到種種改進目的。今盼望於諸位者，在中國利用美國援助時，有許多技術方面，尙有賴於美國之帮助，但中美國情與敎育背景各異，如何使美國方法，適用於中國，行之而有效，必須依賴於久居中國與中國事物有經驗之美友，盡力協助，貢獻意見，如遇有不可免之困難，尤望熟悉中國情形者</p>
<p>善為解釋最後不能不向諸位提及一點，即失敗主義必須排除，同顧第二次大戰中，中·美·英各國，均有若千次好似業已絕望，而因抱住必勝精紳，克致最後勝利。今日吾輩所遭遇之困難，正與戰爭時代相似，何以中外人士均有抱失敗主義者？况今日吾輩正與一世界革命相奮鬥，美國今擔起世界的責任，必須每一國家竭誠盡其能力，有所貢獻，則美國援助各國之目的，庶可成就。盼望吾中美兩國人士以更大的勇氣，來擔負一共同的齊任，祝頌諸位健康。</p>

<p>潑　長夫婦視察庇寒所與收容難民談話（本報攝）</p>
<h3>議長夫婦關心難胞視察兩庇寒所設施　碎米無脹性群稱吃不飽　貧民被誤收哀求出外來</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕本市參議會潑讓長，於昨日下午四時，偕夫人唐冠玉女士，項秘書長昌權，同赴軍工路難民第三庇寒所及西體育路工賑第二庇寒所分別視察難民生活情形。　首先往第三庇寒所參觀婦孺組，當見大批老弱婦女，衣衫襤　，紛紛拉住議長夫婦及前往參觀者涕泣訴苦，彼等大抵爲蘇北及皖北流亡難民，羣稱「每日祗吃兩碗飯，實在吃不飽」。彼等所住之一屋，則汚穢不堪，席地而睡，上舖衡少稻草，二人會　一教·一部份婦女並包圍潘夫人吿稱，「水也沒得喝，更沒水洗臉」。又一人謂：「昨天有人家來賑濟大餅，每人吃了五隻，還有人送來　葡乾」。潘夫人對被等生活極爲關心，一一詳細詢問，並答應不”即當煮些菜來送給大家吃，同時與議長商量，擬再向各界募捐日用品如毛巾之類，分發難民　惟難民羣</p>
<p>賣茶為生兩孩　央求通知家屬</p>
<p>惟難民群中間有既非難民亦非　三，實被誤拉進去者。有一本地口音之婦人，身邊不僅掏出國民身份證，且有選舉權證，渠乃在馬路上以捲香烟爲業者，硬被拖進庇寒所，其夫爲小工頭目，至今不知其妻在庇寒所，而所內亦不准難民出外，口不識丁之無知婦女，無人爲之書信通知，故祗有飲泣，另有男女兩孩，年約十歲，在北火車站賣茶爲生，竟亦被抓去。該兩孩均有父母，來所已九日，然父母均尙不知彼等何往。該孩並將家中地址吿知，苦苦央求記者等通知其家屬。</p>
<p>惦念家中婆兒　堅請放她回去</p>
<p>又有一中年婦人，衣着不似難民，穿長旗袍，『前因事由鎭江來滬探望親戚，亦被誤提入所，伊家中有八十六歲婆婆，六歲遺腹子，痛哭不已，連稱；「明天要年三十了，呌他們老小如何過年？「常塲向項秘書長下跪，堅請放她出去，俾可當晚乘車趕返鎭江，睹狀實令人酸鼻。上述有家屬誤被送人庇寒所者，均經項秘書長紀錄姓名地址，轉請管理員立即調查釋放。</p>
<p>限定食米一斤　為何　到半斤</p>
<p>議長復參觀　房及男子部份，彼等雖不似婦女般哭呌，但亦訴說「飯吃不飽」。議長當即詢問該所副主任陳文義及管理人員，謂得人每日限定一斤米，小孩亦有十一兩，何以難民均稱祗吃到半斤米？並謂：管理方面務必改善，分組分桶，依次發給，務使秩序井然，免得強者多吃，弱者搶不到，同時飲水亦極重要，決不能使難民無水可飲。假使經費不足，自可聲請酌加。</p>
<p>是否當局發下　碎米頗成疑問</p>
<p>後經難民將生米掬示議長，原來此種米碎似小米祇及普通米一粒五六分之一，無甚脹性，且在海雜中極易漏掉。此種碎米是否常局所發下者，實爲疑問。此外，潘夫人亦表示希望管理人員收到棉衣時，來一件即發一件，不必等待全部領到後再行發給難民。該所難民　買數“，常有流動，據各負責人所稱皆不一致，有謂八百多，有謂七百多，最後又稱六百多。總之，第三庇寒所給人印象殊不佳。</p>
<p>極盼酒菜館業　供給殘肴餘羹</p>
<p>議長等繼赴工　第二庇寒所，該所難民共二百餘，大抵來自皖北，棉衣袴均頗整齊，住屋亦爲新砌泥屋，且有有床設備。該所乃由宋石喬主管，管理極佳，議長夫婦當塲備致獎勉。難民所任之工作，即疏濬附近之沙涇港，但報酬甚薄，每　一土方泥僅給資一萬五千元。同時，因彼等皆爲年壯力強而做工者，雖每日有米二十四兩但因油水不進（每人每月柴，油。鹽。菜全部調貪費在內僅八萬元），故仍難吃飽。宋主任極盼酒菜館殘肴餘羹，能供給彼等，稍予調劑。</p>
<h3>司機義勇　找尋家屬</h3>
<p>渠爲體恤難民寒冬歲闌艱苦，昨日工作時間特稍减短，廢曆年初一給假一天，此外又要求當局今日將發給每人一萬元，購買猪肉。當時亦將領得之米出示議長，則皆粒粒白米也。議長夫婦對該所管理，甚表滿意，一面即囑項秘書長與酒菜館接洽，請各分日捐輸殘，一面將於日內私人捐款該所，補助難民購買菜蔬。</p>
<p>又本報司機阿方，因見昨”賣茶男孩流浪庇寒所，特於參觀後驅車往火車站附近，按址找尋該孩家長，果有其人，其父爲車站脚夫，正外出，當由隣居頻頻稱謝，即將吿其父，往該所保領幼子，俾使骨肉團圓。此種見義勇爲之精神，亦只嘉佩。</p>

<h3>赫爾回憶錄（十六）</h3>
<p>— 北美報業聯合會版權所有　本報編譯室</p>
<p>強硬而又不太強硬的外交</p>
<p>當國會鄒論中立法的時候，東北歐方面凶險的發縱，正在吸引我們的注意，情勢堪憂。蘇聯正從事於一種廣大的行動，以謀爲它自已沿波羅的海劃出新的軍略邊界。它顯然在努力增强保衛，防備外國。但是以當時的軍事局勢估計，它的對象不可能是協約國，因爲後者格於德國的力量，根本不能接近彼羅的海。史達林顯然仍以德國爲念，對於一九三九年八月所簽不侵犯條約中希特勒的說話，並不比協約國更具信任。</p>
<p>我們對蘇聯爲保護自己防備德國而作的努力，可以同情，但是我們擔心它的行動將便歐洲的衝突更見緊張。</p>
<p>蘇聯和德國簽訂協定之後，彷彿像躺在泥漿中的一條鯰魚，等待機會。他在九月底和十月，能够不用兵力，一舉而使愛沙尼亞，拉脫維亞和立陶宛三個波羅的海國家納入它的範圍之內。經由各種各樣的壓力，它誘使它們讓出了好幾個軍略根據地，並在三國中的每一國，留駐軍隊二萬人。可是愛沙尼亞，拉脫維亞和旣立陶宛然在名義上還保特它們的政府和獨立，我們覺得並無採取外交步驟的必要。</p>
<p>但是同樣的壓力對　　却沒有發生效力。這個剛强的小國表現「與其讓步母寗作戰」的每一種表筞。</p>
<p>我們對蘇聯的關係，不幸爲了當時美國貨船「巖石城」號事件而成爲很複雜。（這艘船，載有運往英國的各色貨物，於一九三九年十月九日爲德國袖珍戰艦「德意志」號所截獲，並被帶往挪威的托隆沙，其後復被帶往蘇聯的茂曼斯克港。該船之被停留於茂曼斯克，使美國根據海戰規則提出照會。）</p>
<p>蘇聯和芬蘭的談判，就在「最石城」號事件發生的時候在進行中，但情形頗爲不佳。蘇聯要求改變國境，和割　芬關灣中的島嶼根據地，此在芬關看來，是勢將損害它的獨立的。談判於十一月十三日破裂，兩國的關係從此迅速惡化。十一月二十八日下午，蒲立特大使從巴黎打電報吿訴我說，蘇聯剛廢素它對芬蘭的不侵犯條約，將　最近將來進攻芬關。他建議假如我國政府在這種情形之下能够有所作爲，那麼還是從速爲宜。</p>
<p>我立即把這個消息帶給總統，我們當即決定願爲芬蘭和蘇聯調解爭端，出面斡旋，假如它們願意的話。我於是就發一個電報至莫斯科和希爾辛基去，其中我說我國政府對於芬蘇爭端的日益緊張極表關切，並且說：「假如戰爭範圍再吿擴大，致使國際關係　趨惡化，那麼在我國看來，是極端遺憾的。設若雙方同意，我國政府樂於出面斡旋，而決不在任何方面牽涉爭端，一切唯以和平解決爭端爲職志。」</p>
<p>芬蘭歡迎我們的建議，但蘇聯則覺得並無斡旋的可能。翌日，史達林發動了他對芬蘭的進攻，包括轟作若干城古在內。</p>
<p>我們對於另一次戰事的爆發，極感失望。總統和我就此事商談一過之後，他在戰爭發生後的次日向報界發表了一個强硬的聲明。地說：「所有愛好和平國家的人民，凡是依然希望在全世界繼續根據法律秩序來維持國際關係的，將一致責難這一個用武力來解決國際異見的新行動。」他並且向芬蘭和蘇聯提出呼籲，要求避免轟炸平民。</p>
<p>史丹因哈特從莫斯科發電報給我說，當他向莫洛托夫外長提出這個呼籲時，莫氏絕對否認蘇聯空軍曾經轟炸過平民或者不設防城市，或者具有這種意向。（我們駐希爾辛基的公使館曾發給我們許多電報，列舉蘇聯轟炸不設防城市的許多事實。）史丹因哈特說，在他和莫洛托夫談話中獲得一種印象，就是蘇聯外長不希望第三者調停，蘇聯的開始戰爭，目的在儘速淸算芬蘭問題，因此可以對巴爾幹和黑海區或者從德國方面來的發展，可以自由應付。</p>
<p>當時我們就決定向蘇聯實施道德禁運，不得以飛機輸往蘇聯，這種辦法，對日本是已經實施的了。</p>
<p>總統和我早就決定不擬以中立法案適用於蘇芬戰爭。在政府的立塲，我們不能把軍火出售予芬關，但是我們不願意阻止私人出口商出售軍火，假如他們願法的話。再者，由於默洲戰爭而宣佈的交戰地帶，我們的船隻已經不得進入波羅的海。最後，我們還是設法避免使蘇聯成爲一個法律上的交戰國。我們深切感到共產主義蘇聯和納粹德國本質上的仇視是如此深刻，而希特勒的野心又如此漫無止境，最後蘇聯可能會到協約國方面來的。我們必須謹愼從事，不要迫它向另一個方向走。</p>
<p>我國本身和蘇聯之間的不愉快關係，可於十二月初發生的一樁事情見之。自從我們於一九三三年和蘇聯建立外交關係以來，我們在那裏的領事官吏一直受到種種的限制，這種限制，我國是不會想到適用於類似的外國官吏的。他們的行動受約束，他們隨時被監視，他們在到達或者離開的時候，行李總是被檢查的。</p>
<p>最後，我決定想試試在我國也適用同樣的待遇，是否對於蘇聯的忽視禮儀，可以比外交抗議更能促使蘇方注意。當蘇聯外交部爲一個到紐約來的新副領事申請一張「自由通行證」（領有這種文件的人可以不受海關檢查）時，在莫斯科的史丹因哈特大使就回答說，假如蘇聯政府對於來去的美國的領事官員，也能發出類似的文件，我們是樂於這樣做的。蘇聯加以拒絕。於是史丹因哈特建議當蘇聯副領事到紐約的時候，他的行李應受海關人員檢查。</p>
<p>這件事情照辦了。於是，在十二月七日，奧曼斯基大使打電話給梅塞史密斯助理國務鄕，提出强硬抗議。我們當即通知他副領事行李之被檢查，乃是爲了來往於蘇聯的美國領事，行李也被檢查之故，我們是一向是應用相互的原則的。</p>
<p>奧曼斯基力爭這種問題應該根據最惠國原則辦理。這就是說蘇聯將對待我們的領事，猶如它對待任何其他國家的領事一樣；我們應該對待蘇聯的領事，猶如我們對待任何其他國家的領事一樣。</p>
<p>但是我們通知大使，我國政府許多年來處理這類事情，一向是根據相互原則的，意思就是說，我們將對待蘇聯領事，猶如　鄹對待我們的領事。</p>
<p>奏曼斯基於是要求我們代表去確定他的政府是否慣於檢查我國到蘇聯去的領事行李的。史丹因哈特大使徇其要求，送來了一連串的例子。</p>
<p>由於總統對於這件事情發生興趣，我就送給他一份由梅塞史密斯　就的備忘錄。十二月二十二日，總統在一個備忘錄中回答說：</p>
<p>「十二月十六日你送給我的有關蘇聯對美國外交人員所加限制的備忘錄，極爲精彩，我想我們對於蘇聯所造成的每一種麻煩，憊以類似的麻煩作爲答覆。</p>
<p>「但是當牽涉到更達林，加里寗或者莫洛托夫等人的魯莽舉動時，我們這裏却不能以同樣的魯莽舉動相對付。可是我以爲這樣的一天不久就會到來，就是說我們不妨把局勢直接促使奧曼斯基注意。我們很可以吿訴他一點，就是他的政府朱能答覆我有關轟炸平民的電報，以及未能允准我國大使和「巖石城」號通消息，頗有完全不顧文明政府間普通的禮貌和友好關係的樣子，因此總統老實覺得很奇怪，懷疑蘇聯政府是否認爲値得繼續外交關係。我們以此爲止，不必再進一步，但是這已够使蘇聯政府感到一種負担了。」</p>
<p>我們把這種意思傳達給蘇聯人，但是蘇聯官員幾世紀來遺傳下來的對外國人的猜疑態度，並無變更。</p>
<p>滬種來自蘇聯方面的次要的麻煩，　續使總統頗爲頭痛。史丹因哈特發來了一個電報，吿訴我們說莫斯科大使館今後將不再能打長途電話了，除非親自到中央電話局去。我把這個電報送給總統之後，他就在一九四〇年一月十日寫給我這個備忘錄：</p>
<p>「我在想我們是否能够用同樣的規則，適用於這裹的蘇聯大使館——或者至少吿訴奧曼斯基說我們想這樣做法。這也可以說是人情之常！FDR」</p>
<p>但是後來史丹因哈特又來了一個電話，說這樁困難已經解決了。</p>
<p>雖然在需要向蘇聯直言的時候，我們從不猶豫，但是我規定一個基本政策，就是儘可能和蘇聯保特良好的關係，決不給它絲毫的印象，以爲我們是一個當前的或者潛在的敵人。友誼之門一直是敞開的，至少我願意用折衷辦法和蘇聯相處。</p>

<h3>整治蘇州河</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕住在上海的人，都知道這兒有條蘇州河，橫貫東西，和黃浦江相接。它是上海三大幹河之一，最大部份的民食——如米·油·肉……都經過這條蘇州河而來。</p>
<p>前些日子，本市突破過五年來的寒冷氣候的紀錄，這使蘇州河也蒙受了影響，它結冰了。食米凍在途中，無法遝來，米價因而大跳，幸而翌日冰融復航，米價才又回跌。從這個例子中，可以看出蘇州河對於上海的重要，這正像是咽喉之於人類，息息相　。</p>
<p>上海的咽喉會不會游塞</p>
<p>上海人都知道蘇州河的重要，但很少人會注意到這上海的咽喉，已經有十年來未加保養，它馬上就可能出亂子。河流原是需要經常加以疏濬的，而蘇州河已經有十年未加疏濬，現在河床已漸趨狹窄，尤其是冬季低水時期，米糧船隻已經不能按期進口，長此以往，後果將不堪設想。你能够想像得到，萬一有一天咽喉淤塞了，這對於上海人將會是一個多麼可怕的致命傷。</p>
<p>市政府早已注意到這個嚴重的問題，但是復員二年來所以遲遲未動者，是爲了經費無着，無力舉辦。依照目前物價估計，挖土費每立方碼約需十二萬元，疏濬蘇州河的全部費用，達三千億元以上。偌大的數目，市府設法籌劃，中央又不能貼補，疏濬工程雖然重要，也就不得不暫且延擱了。</p>
<p>繳納升科費充疏濬之用</p>
<p>十年以前，蘇州河是怎樣疏濬的？經費來源又如何籌措的呢？——當時負責疏濬工作的是前英工部局濬浦局，經費全部出之於「升科費」，所謂「升科費」者，就是凡沿岸地皮，購爲私有者（如建築私有碼頭等），須向八家繳納捐稅——即稱「升科費」。當時這筆稅捐相當可觀，濬浦局與我政府訂有協定，「升科費」由濬浦局徵收，俾充作疏濬之用。自一九三一年至一九六五年，該局派遺挖泥船五艘，日夜不停工作，才算完成了疏濬大業。翌年，戰事突發，工程也就擱淺，結算下來，收支相抵後，還要多出九萬餘元，這筆錢到現在還不知道應該怎樣歸還我政府呢。</p>
<p>「升科費〕充作疏濬經費而有餘，市府何不繼續沿用呢？——問題在於時遷月移，「升科費」在今日，已不若昔日的源源而來。原來黃浦江邊可以升科的地方，早都升了科，升科費也就收到了　頭。沒有經費，疏濬也就無法動手，但是市工務局還在萬難之中，圖盡最大的努力。</p>
<p>要徹底解決從幹河着手</p>
<p>復負以來，該局做了二樁補救的工程：（一）疏濬與蘇州河平行河道，俾减少其運載量。已經完工的有蘊藻浜，走馬塘，蒲匯塘，漕河涇等（二）疏濬蘇州河重要支流，俾分散船只，並聯絡平行河道。已完工者有木凟港，桃樹浦等。</p>
<p>上列工程，工務局確曾盡過最大的努力。他們利用行總的麵粉，在去年發動義務勞動服役，今冬又利用冬令救濟工賑制度，辦來成績卓著，也曾解救了一部份難題。然而頭痛醫頭，脚痛醫脚，究竟不是辦法。要諜問題的澈底解決，還須從疏濬幹河本　着手。</p>
<p>市工務局去會夏召集　局公用局等會商辦法，決定自河口向上至麥根路恒　橋止，由濬浦局調派挖泥船開濬。船隻，器材，人工，　歸濬浦局組任，所需材料及帶纜樁鄒，由工務局供給。濬　局，去年七月動王後，　　後　餘設備加速進行，半年來，僅挖泥十六萬立方碼，而蘇州河的全部土方，達二百六十萬立方碼，照濬浦局目前的速度算來，要二十五年才能疏濬完成！</p>
<p>二年五年究竟是太沉長的歲月，上海港務委員會於上月開會時，　加檢討後，決定呈請中央需江海關附稅濬浦捐准予加倍征收，即原爲百分之三增至百分之六，這樣每年可增加一千二百億之譜。除用於黃浦江疏藩外，當可充分供給疏濬蘇州河之用。上項辦法，吳市長極表贊同，而且認爲疏濬工程已急如星火，特拍電催請中央早日核准。現在照准的覆電，日前已經到達市府了。</p>
<p>浩大的工程不久即動工</p>
<p>經費問題一經解決，餘下來的是如何充竄設備，俾加强工程速率問題。經過港務整理委員會再度討論後，決由工務局及濬浦局會同合作辦理。現濬浦局有挖泥船二艘，擬增吸泥船二隻，工務局有挖泥船二艘，工務局有挖泥船二艘，決參加工作，並擬向行總在左餘物資中配售挖泥船四艘，這樣嚴密合作之下，每月約可挖泥二萬立方碼，全部工程，可望於四年之內全部完成了。</p>
<p>市府方面，希望濬浦局能够左濬浦中，劃出三分之二—即八百億，作為疏濬蘇州河的經費。則積四年捐款，即有三千二百億，剛好足够完成全部疏濬工程，市府認爲一切都非常合乎理想。且工程開工後，需長期雇用小工萬餘名，担負築壩，抽水，挑泥，運土等等工作，這對於輾轉於上海成羣的難民，也不失爲是個生產的好機會。所以疏濬蘇州河，實攸關上海的市容，民生，經濟，及難民救濟工作。</p>
<p>現在港務委員會正與濬浦局方面商討動工步驟。假如一切順利，俟濬浦局長丁貴堂自香港回來作最後決定後，這浩大的工程，立即可以開工了。</p>
<p>但願疏濬早日圓滿展開，讓蘇州河永遠爲上海人而服役！（本報記者洪絮才）</p>

<p>據女子供：姓麻，名鳳華，北平人，年二十一歲，住北平德勝門外塔院六號。死者名黃文相，十九歲，係其姨表弟。兩人是近親，渦從甚密，界種情根。黃曾向父母提出婚姻要求，但被拒絕，致悶悶不樂，存自殺之念。上月三十日上午，黃在街上與表姊相遇，遂同至中山公園，澈夜未歸。次日天明，同搭車抵津，下楊於東車站旁之天津旅館。延至傍晚，雙雙出外，尋覓死所。</p>
<p>黃文相與麻鳳華，離旅館後，徘徊於鐵路旁側，遂生臥軌自殺之念。時天已黑，兩人互相抱持，橫臥於路軌上。迨火車駛來，撞及女子頭部，將身體撥轉，致獲殘生。其時不見其表弟，大呼其名，亦未見答，乃匍匐車軌前，覓得半截屍體，於是抱住大哭</p>
<p>現麻鳳華雖已獲救，但在醫院中不肯進餐，決定絕食殉情，，並囑勿爲家庭知曉。</p>

<p>雪白首開紀綠</p>
<p>綠隊首先發球，黃如玉犯規，石瑛罰球踏綫不入，旋吳愛蓮亦犯規，雪白王慧玲一素得男，即以一對〇前導。逾一分給後，黃明媛罰球得點，綠隊扳成平手，雪白王珊罰中，綠隊李蘊芝入塲，易出石瑛，黃明媛擲罰俱中，錄隊驟增三分，王珊籃下揮入，又成各四，明媛百步穿楊，首節完畢，綠隊以六比四佔先。第二節開始，李蘊芝遠擲鵠中，雪白張秀麗罰球得點，綠隊石瑛重行入塲，易出朱潔，石瑛下馬施咸，明緩右角揮入，綠隊即一路前領，雪白反攻，王珊兩罰兩中，奈綠隊緊迫不捨，前半時完畢，雪白以九比十五落後。</p>

<p>〔天津訊〕開灤礦務局總經理王崇植，値母喪，節約喪禮五億元，捐贈南開大學經濟研究所，定名「王母范太夫人紀念金」，藉示追念母敎劬勞之意</p>
<h3>改進科學敎育　培植創造精神　敎部統籌製造儀器　各省市普科學館</h3>
<p>〔南京航訊〕我國過去學校科學敎育，多偏重於解釋記誦，殊難養成實證之習慣及培植創造之精神。民衆科學敎育更少有重視，各省遵照部令設有「科學館」者，旣寥寥無幾，且多設備簡陋，經費困難，難有工作表現。故數十年來推行科學敎育之結果，學生對於科學極少感覺興趣，以致學習成績甚差，民衆更缺乏科學常識與科學精神，且仍充滿迷信思想，治事做人，毫無科學態度與方法。敎育都有鑒於此，故正積極從事科學敎育之改進，已訂定辦法如左：（一）中小學科學敎育須注意下列數事：1設備應加充實，俾使兒童涵養在自然科學氣氛中。2獎勵兒童自動研習，以啓發其學習之興趣。3改進科學敎材，以適應兒童經騐與需要。（二）各省市科學館未設立者，應迅速遵照部頒省市立科學館組織通則，限期籌備設立。已設立者應寬籌經費，充實設備，政府應爲各館劃撥充實設備之外匯，或由敎部向國外統購科學用品，分發各館應用。（三）各級民衆敎育館應將推行民衆科學敎育列爲中心工作之一。（四）各縣市應普遍設立「科學實騐所」，供各縣市所屬各級學校師生，及當地民衆實騐研究之用。（五）統籌製造儀器標本及編印岡籍，1由敎育部統籌，就全國學校分佈情形，劃分爲若干區，於每區擇適當地點，需設科學儀器製造所一所，區內學校所需各項科學儀器標本藥品，由其經常充分供給。2其不能自製之儀器標本或因需要量過大，一時不及自製者，即由敎育部就全國各省市學校實際需要，統籌向國外購置配給。3有關科學敎育之重要圖書，亦請由敎育部統籌大量編印或編譯，陸續配發。</p>
<h3>同濟大學　學生課外活動　決定七項辦法</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕同濟大學日前舉行行政會議，就學生課外活動問題，決定辦法七項如下：（一）在本校學生自治會，朱經正式組織以前，凡與學生自洽有關事項，暫准由各級級長代向訓導處轉呈。（二）本校原有各學生團體，即日起一律停止活動，俟另定日期，重予依法登記。（三）本校原有各學生壁報刋物，即日起一律取消，禁止張貼，俟學校安定後，再予公佈日期，依法登記。（四）在整頓時期，除各級得單獨舉行級會外，不得有其他之集會，至級會之紀錄，應由級長負責呈報訓導處。（五）學生不得招引任何校外人士或團體到校集會或演講。（六）凡在校學生進出校門，應佩帶校徽，並隨帶學生證，以便查驗。（七）凡在校學生，如有所建議，應書面呈請有關主管部份轉校長核示，不得隨意張貼佈吿。</p>
<h3>九大學籃球賽　一幕精彩特寫　威士康辛五戰五勝</h3>
<p>〔本報特譯〕籃球的發明人詹姆士·納史密斯，爲了防範這種判分勝負的遊戲可能引起粗暴舉動，特地設立規則十三條，不使籃球員在比賽時彼此有身體觸接的機會。但是，在五十幾年前，往往在散塲之後，發生強壯的球員跟踪毆辱徒步回家的弱小球員的事件。現在，詹姆士去世不過八年，他更料想不到美國九所大學的學生，將籃球運動，當做什麼樣的遊戲？</p>
<p>犯規累累</p>
<p>美國的「九大」籃球錦標賽，到上月中旬爲止，威士康辛隊五戰五捷，領袖羣雄。該隊力取愛渥華隊一幕，競爭劇烈，異乎尋常。雙方球員被判犯規者共四十七次，被罰離塲者共計四人，而至終局時，尙有在塲球員四名，都已經各判犯規四次之多。比賽係在威士康辛的瑪迪遜舉行，觀衆達一萬三千人，大部爲本州威斯康辛隊捧塲，呌囂不休，情緒浮囂，推波助瀾，對愛渥華隊則大喝倒采，如此對待客隊，未免太過。</p>
<p>嗤罵裁判</p>
<p>威隊隊長麥爾士，作戰勇猛，竟將對方一球員，撞出離塲十五呎以外，倒入前排觀者膝上，麥因此判罰離塲，觀衆即以嗤嗤聲，咒駡裁判，並向麥喝采愛渥華隊中的魏亞，身材短小，去冬曾至瑪迪遜比賽，觀衆獲有印象，當年魏在近籃處屢投不中，飽受嘲弄，觀衆大呼：「射籃！射籃！」魏力持忍耐，果然時來運轉，反連奪二十四分。上月中旬，與威隊對抗，魏亞也取獲二十分，成爲全塲獲分最多的一人。當魏亞犯滿離塲，竟博得全堂掌聲，客隊球負，能獲這樣的榮寵，實屬不易。</p>
<p>主隊加分</p>
<p>爲了球迷的如此取鬧，反而影響主隊作戰情緒，於是，美國的籃球專家，遇到這樣的情形，時常在未開賽前，先替主隊在掛分脾上加上六分。在「九大比賽」這樣重大的節目裘，應該起碼加上十分才是。威隊最初五戰，俱在本地舉行，竟吿全勝。</p>
<p>咸隊使用全速力的「足球式」的戰術，奔走，投射，毫無停逗或作瞄準式的射籃。不過，當威隊的前鋒「矮鷄」谷克——他是去年度「九大」獲分最多的一員——偶作固定式的推擲投籃時，便由其餘的威隊隊員三人，環立在谷克的前面，作嚴密的擋人法，藉此增加谷克投籃的自信心和準確性。</p>
<p>比賽結果</p>
<p>那一塲比賽的結果，威斯康辛以六〇比五一勝愛渥華。終塲笛聲長鳴，愛渥華的一個球員，怒氣冲冲地搖動紀錄牌，喊道：「等着，讓我們在愛渥華收拾你們！」</p>
<p>用不着等待那樣久，美國籃球强隊間的勝負，是時常難以捉摸的，五天之後，密歇根隊征瑪迪遜，咸斯康辛隊應戰，以三九比四十三敗下陣來，造成該隊本季的第一次敗績。（昌年）</p>

<h3>昨通過申請案廿六件　收購成品告一段落</h3>

<h3>農部謀糧食自足　十一省設增產區</h3>
<p>政病爲謀自給自足起見，對於糧食之增產，已下最大之決心。本年度農林部，已擬定增產計劃，頃據該部農業推廣委員會主任委員談，本年決採重點主義。在產糧食省份，設置增產區。已決定江·浙·皖·湘·鄂·贛·粵·桂·豫·川·閩等十一省產糧食省份，設置兩個至三個之增產區。每一增產區，劃定若干產糧食最豐之縣份，爲糧食增產區域。在此區域內，水利，種子，肥料等項，須配合晨貸政策。該區內之人力物力完全集中使用，曾於去年由部派員分赴各省作實地之調查，正整理報告中。實施辦法即可決定。政院去年已撥款兩百億，備購稻麥種子，及藥械等物品，本年先從稻子着手，下半年及於小麥與雜糧。稻子之增產目標，本年爲八百萬石，過去過求管遍，但人力物力，易於分散，成效不大。故改採重點主義，在副定之增產區內，務使能達到預定之結果。</p>
<h3>財部通函中央銀行　查明機關存款戶名</h3>
<p>財政部近通函中央銀行轉飭各分行檢查機關，對於各機關存款戶名，必須查明眞實名稱，以防流弊。原函云「據貴行各地分行檢查各銀行業務報吿內常列各機關存款戶名如「征集會」「軍差價」「折征專戶」「業務費」「閩台署」「閩浙署」「特稅款」等，每無機關名稱，或簡略而不詳，難於懸揣，而無法行查糾正。嗣後　請通飭各分行檢查機構，對於此類機關存款戶名，務必查明存款機關眞實名稱，以便辦理，相應　達，即希查照。</p>
<h3>中農決定貸款　培植贛東紙產</h3>
<p>本報南昌航訊，贛東瑞金石城的重紙，在戰時因爲紙張進口的困難，產銷頗爲可觀。現在洋紙的進口，因外匯短缺，印刷事業，依然感覺紙荒的嚴重，中國農民銀行茲爲輔助贛省紙產手工業，並解決紙荒問題，決在朮紙產區貸放大量的生產貸款，經由總行派專家一人，來贛調查，並在滬與商務，中華書局接洽，採用贛紙印書。各該書局亦認爲贛產紙張，如能依照白報紙尺度改良，並提高紙產的本質，亦樂於採用。現農行舉辦之紙業貸款，決定直接貸放槽戶，收漿照市價購紙，並已在南雄定製紙型篾簾，貸予槽戶。一俟該項篾簾造成，即開始辦理貸款款手續云。</p>
<h3>英國減低限價　冰蛋出口困難</h3>
<p>戰前我國冰蛋出口數字，年約四萬噸。戰後出口銳减，其原因以主要對象之英國外匯不豐，及我國成本激增所致。去年度政府爲鼓勵外銷，爭取國際市塲地位計，曾由轍管會輸出推廣處託中信局向茂昌公司購置大批冰蛋輸英，先後裝出七批，共達三九二〇噸。當舉辦之初，我國原料每市担僅及一六〇萬元，後即逐步上漲，突破二〇〇萬元。是以第一批二〇〇噸，每噸計四八九〇萬元，第二批一〇〇噸，每噸五六七七萬五千元，第三批二〇〇噸，每噸五九四〇萬元，第四批一〇〇噸，每噸六二〇〇萬元。彼時英國售價除三一一〇噸每噸爲二〇〇英鎊外，其餘每噸概售二一〇英鎊，折合國幣每噸約虧耗百分之二五〇至三〇〇之譜，均由政府津貼。後以原料不斷高翔，而英國又基於過去春令冰蛋滋價慣例，已將限價每噸由二一〇英鎊减至二〇〇英鎊。據悉：目前鷄蛋每市担爲三六〇萬元，連同工激電費等，每噸實際成本約爲三二〇英鎊。政府若再採取津貼政策，未免負担過鉅。然據業市人估計，今春鷄蛋價格比照一般物價爲低，再照比例推算，將來漲風不致兇猛，在銷路上估計，今年對英之總輸出量可達七千噸左右。政府爲爭取外匯，推動出口及維持我鼠冰蛋在國際市塲上之地位，應通盤計鐵，不必斤斤於津貼多寡問題。又如成本高漲，並不止原料一點，如生活指數，水電，交通等，均應包括在內。更如全年輸出　及其獲取外匯之總額，在在均應予重親，考慮其得失，以權衡輕重，惟可國慮者，在乎英鎊將來之穩定程度耳。</p>

<p>據工商輔導處調查，國內製造硫酸廠，約有卅餘家，遍及上海·天津·重慶·貴陽·昆明·蘭州·太原·廣州·瀋陽·台灣等地，而市塲目前多以舶來品硫酸充斥市上，按國內製造硫酸機器能力而論，每年總產量可達十五萬噸，足供國內實需而有鈴。爲使該業繁榮起見，應禁止舶來品輸人，該處現已擬定今年度輔導該業計劃如下：（一）將硫酸輸入限額改購硫磺進口，旣可節省外國，又可解決原料問題。因一噸硫磺，可製三噸硫酸之故。（二）獎勵使用接觸法機器之工廠設立，以改善品質。（三）輔助硫化元工廠，增產硫磺，以達自給原料之目的。其預定效果在一年內設立每月可製五萬隻耐酸罐之工廠一家，及每月可出硫磺一千噸之提煉工廠一家，並規定舶來原料之進口量。該處以硫酸生產關係國防農業工業甚深，決日內呈經濟部予以扶植，以挽重要工業云。</p>
<h3>資委會在海南島　籌設鍊鐵廠</h3>
<p>海南島所產之鐵砂，爲我國特產之一。產量極豐，除用以對日易貨外，剩餘仍多。惜因我國工業未發達，不能儘量利用。現實源委員會爲應各方面請求，將在該島專門設立一鍊鐵廠，利用剩餘之鐵砂煉鐵。該會刻已積極偶備，資本將由該會獨自負担，以求創立一最健全之煉鐵廠云。</p>

<h3>科學為建國的基礎</h3>
<p>— 劉咸</p>
<p>—應上海市敎育局邀約在亞美電臺廣播詞—</p>
<p>對於「科學」，我想大家一定有相當的認識，丙爲我們的日常生活，處處都和科學有密切的關係。可是究竟什麼是科學？恐怕還有些人不甚了解，有解釋的必要。簡單的設，科學是有系統，有組織，可以實驗的一們大部門的知識。科學是實　求是，不尙空談的。最近三百年來，科學的進步最快，成績發皇，哲學文藝，都比不上。我們利用了科學的發現和發明，擴大了我們知識的領域，增加了我們生活的享樂，所以有人設，科學是現代文明的基石，是人類智慧的泉源，它被發展到現階段，眞是人類思想發展過程中的一個奇蹟。</p>
<p>自從兩顆原子彈在廣島和長崎奏效後，把第二次世界大戰提前結束了，拯救了無數的生命，科學的威力，也因此顯示到極度了。直到現在，國際間一切的政治·外交·經濟·軍事的動向，多少還受到原子彈的影響。無疑地現在是科學的世界，並且進入了原子能時代。</p>
<p>科學不但是現代物質文明的保姆，同時也是建國的基礎。我們在抗戰期間，不是喊出過「抗戰建國」的口號嗎？這是全國上下一致的要求。現在抗戰已經結束兩年多了，論理，早應踏上建國的大道，可是因爲國家多故，建國大業始終沒有開步邁進，大好機會，因循坐誤，這是多麼可惜的事！我們經過了八年的抗戰，國家原氣大傷，人民疾苦，水深火熱，改善民生，培養國力，實在刻不容緩。加以戰後世界局勢，動盪不定，時代巨輪，不斷前進，列強都在作國防安全的打算，努力戰後的經濟復興，倘若我們不善把握時機，從事建國工作，以應迫切的需求，不要說這次勝利成果難保，假使第三次大戰爆發，那我們的國防安全和民族命運，就難以想像了。所以根據這兩項理由，我們國家　興亡和民族的盛衰，都要看我們能不能把國家從破壞中建設起來。這任務是艱鉅的，責任是重大的，路途是遙遠的，要大家一齊努力。</p>
<p>爲了求國家的安全，爲了爭民族的生存，我們認爲建國大業的進行，是有其時代的重要性。我們應該高瞻遠矚，要有建國的理想，周諮博訪，要有建國的計劃，這是爲全國同胞謀幸福，同時也是爲後世子孫植根基。</p>
<p>所謂要有建國的理想，就是說，我們應該把我們這個支離破碎的國家，建成一個富强康樂的國家，我們應該內察國情，外觀大勢，順應世界的潮流，把我們這老大的文明古國，現代化起來；把許多愚昧無識的國民，敎育起來；把將要淪亡的道德，重振起來。總而言之，把我們這地大，物博，人衆可愛的祖國，用羣策羣力，雞成一個獨立，自由，和平，民主的國家。這是我們的理想，這是我們的遠景。</p>
<p>不過建國大業，經緯萬端，決非一蹴可幾。我們需要精密的計劃，有了完善的計劃，然後才可以逐步實施，才可以分期雞設，才可以徵練人才，才可以籌措經費。像蘇聯施行了幾個五年計劃，收到了建國的大效，現在又在實行戰後第一次新的五年計劃，可以做我們的榜樣。所以我們應該用精細準確的方法，放大眼光，製定方案，分期實行，分地建設，急其所急，緩其可緩，五年計劃不够，作十年計劃，十年計劃不够，準備二十年計劃。最後一定可以達到建國的目的。我們是中華民國的國民，要有自信心，我們是黃帝的子孫，要有恢宏的氣魄，秦始皇築長城，隋煬帝開運河，都建樹了人類歷史上偉大的功績。難道我們生在二十世紀的今日，受過科學教育，就不能踵武先民，把我們的國家建設成功嗎？</p>
<p>現在我們站在科學的立塲，以爲無論我們建國的理想如何崇高，計劃怎樣美備，自信心何等堅定，氣魄那樣的宏偉，我們要想達到我們的理想，實現我們的計劃，堅定我們的信念，發揮我們的氣魄，我們不能不注重一個有潛力的因素，那就是科學的運用。換句話設，科學是我們建國的基礎。沒有科學作基礎，建國是無從着手的，沒有科學，就無國防，沒有科學，談不到改善民生；甚至可以這樣說，一個人沒有科學智識，就不配做現代人，一個國家沒有科學文化，就不得稱爲一個現代化的國家。</p>
<p>最近全國經濟委負會草擬了一套經濟改革方案，內容分工業，農業，礦業，水利，交通，金融，財政各部份，頗爲詳盡，眞能一一付諸實施，限期完成，到可視爲建國的一部分工作。不過其中所需要的科學知識和技術人才，可就不少了。像工業，水利，交通各部門，無非是數學，物理，化學的應用，農業是雞築在生物學上的，礦業是以地質學，化學等爲基礎的，所以我們要想推廣科學的應用，首先要注意純理科學的研究，純理科學的基礎打好了，應用是很容易的。換句話說，如果我們的科學研究有了成績，經濟改革也就容易了。水有源，太有本，我們的建國基本，是立在科學上的。</p>
<p>最後，我願趁此機會，應起政府當局，社會賢達和科學界人士的注意，就是雞國大　　進行，萬不容核，所以應時勢　需求，所以保國家的地位，更所以謀國家的統一；要有完善　計劃，要有科學的基礎，多籌經費，廣徴人才，分別先後緩念，隨時擇地建設，政府主持大計　上，社會人士從旁贊助，科學家努力從事，三方面通力合作，埋頭苦幹，以二十年爲期，相信我們的建國大業，必可以順利完成國家利賴，民族獲福！（二月六日）</p>
<h3>電石</h3>
<p>— 鮑忠祈</p>
<p>化學工業之母</p>
<p>當你在夜晚的馬路上走着的時候，不是看見人行道兩旁的水菓攤上，燃着一支光亮的燈火嗎？這就是我們所知道的電石燈。</p>
<p>電石燈的原理很簡單，只要把電石加水，它就產生一種會燃燒的氣體，俗稱電石氣，遇火即燃。</p>
<p>其實，用科學來解釋這現象，電石的學名是碳化鈣CaF2，與水反應產生乙炔C2H2，這原理不是很簡單嗎？</p>
<p>別看輕了這帶磷化氣惡臭的氣體——乙炔，它的用處包括任何一項化學工業，可以設是未來中國化工事業的基礎。</p>
<p>這裏讓我們把它的用途分析介紹一下：</p>
<p>在修理車行或鐵店的門首，我們不是常常看見工人拿着一支耀眼的火燄在做溶接的工作嗎？這就是乙炔與氧合成的氣炔吹管。</p>
<p>但是，乙炔最重要的用途不在這些，它能使本身好像中間產物（Intermediate　products）一樣，產生無數重要的化合物：像三個分子的乙炔能够聚化（ploymerization）而成苯（Benzcne），苯是有機化學中芳香族化合物（Aromatic　conmpounds）的起點，藥品，染料，和炸藥等莫不由苯開始，在國外化學工業的所以發達，完全由於從煤焦油（Coal　tar）中提煉　大量的苯，當然這項工作在中國是不容易做到的，因此，中國將來如要發展種種化學工業的話，苯的來源除了舶來品以外，唯有仰仗於乙炔的聚化了。</p>
<p>乙炔的用途不僅這些，它同時也是有機化學中脂肪族化合物的起點（Aliphatic　conmpounds），酒精，汽油，和肥皂等也都可由它做起。</p>
<p>乙炔，或者說電石吧，它簡直是化學工業的極紐，它的研究也可設是包括了科學計劃中化學的一部，化學家們對它已有一個美麗的遠景。</p>
<p>問題倒在於中國缺少唯一的動力！水電，只要YVA的水力發電計劃能够如理想辦下去，誰能够設中國的化學工業沒有前途呢！</p>
<h3>印刷無綫電</h3>
<p>— 倪尙達</p>
<p>眞空管爲無綫電機之心臟；電阻，綫圈，　容器爲無綫軍機之骨架。以上四種機件，就目前之製造與設計，其配成之無綫電機，最小體積，亦須在十立方英寸左右。最近美國若干思想前進之無綫電工程師，擬將電阻，綫圈與　容器三者，採用化學上特製之液體，如墨水　墨油之類，印刷或　　於絕緣片上，使一架無綫　機，成輕便易帶之扁平體。如是可用印刷文字方法，大量生產。减少成本之外，又能免除修理無綫電機之費時工作。蓋一般從事無綫電業者，皆知修理機器，工作最繁，費時最多，轉成最大之金錢消耗。倘有印刷無綫電，一切標準化。一機損壞，捨舊購新，僅須支付極低廉之代價。修理舊機，已無必要，省時省工，不喻可知。且於無綫電之製造工業，亦將全部改革，我人驟聞此說，驚爲　　，如何可成事實？實則現時所用之柵　電阻，可以鉛筆或墨水，畫於絕緣紙上，所成條紋，則爲幾兆默姆之高電阻。依此推廣，利用化學上各種有機或無綱化今物之溶液，不難成電阻較小之條紋，以作一般適用之電阻器。圈綫本有繞成扁平蛛網狀者，不用這綫而用良導之液體，印刷於絕緣片上，當可製成適量之磁感器，電容器之製造，已能噴射金屬粉於絕緣紙上，如是「容器之扁小化，亦無問題，眞空管早有花生管（Peanutb　Tube）與橡子管（Acorn　Tube），體積微小，已近菓粒。</p>
<p>最近又有所謂微粒管（Microtube）者，較稻穀略大，已由美國國立標準局設計製造，採用於軍用無綫電機，詳形如何，雖未公佈，但眞空管之微小化，巳由理想而成爲事實。磁性合金之「阿林可」（Alinco），體積小而磁性强，可以製造小型喇叭之外，當能製成極小之發電機，以作無綫電電源。由此言之，就目前之成品，與未來之趨勢，再加美國之工業設備，工程人材，印刷無綫電，幾年努力，必可行銷市塲。理想爲事實之母，苟於四十年前，第一架火花式無綫電發報機，開始於英倫建設之時，以言今日之電視或雷達，痴人說夢，誰曰不宜。今之視昔，無異於來者之視今。姑視今日之印刷無綫電，爲四十年前之雷達，謹拭目以待之。</p>
<h3>最小轔微鏡</h3>
<p>— 洪恩</p>
<p>不過鉛筆般大的顯微鏡，現在已供給研究科學的學者們應用了。它的目鏡部份可以旋轉，用來確定焦點；物鏡部份的一端切去了一斜塊，是供給光綫之用。旣簡單又便利，而放大率有二十五倍之大，足可觀察細小的粉末般的物質。</p>
<h3>科學拾零</h3>
<p>— 謝章濤</p>
<p>飛機植草——爲了防止雨水冲蝕地面表土，淤寒河道起見，美國最近利用飛機散播雜草種子，生長後可免除表土的冲刷，一架飛機工作一日，可散播二萬英畝面積。一萬英畝面積須用二百四十噸種子，每畝地的播種費是二元零三分，內中種子佔去二角八分。</p>
<p>容車巨鐵—用四十五輛卡車運輸零件及裝配三月而成的美國印第安那州煤礦塲重一千一百噸的掘土機已開始工作了。此機每日挖土三萬五千立方碼，就是等於開掘二百幢房屋的基地，他的掘土鏟，大到可容一輛大卡車開入而有餘，這「巨靈之掌」每挖土二次，就能裝滿一整節運貨火車，他用一千八百匹馬力作動力，只要三個人管理。</p>
<p>水彈救林—每年森林的失火焚燒，使美國失去三千一百萬英畝的森林，故而美國現採用新式有效的飛饑携帶內裝永份或化學品的滅火彈，前往投擲施救，每架B-29型機可帶八只一百六十五加侖的水彈，投擲後，降落至貼近火燄上。能自動溶解化成雨幕下降。</p>
<h3>單雌生殖子裔的性別決定（續）</h3>
<p>— 謝冶英</p>
<p>我們知道普通兩性生殖細胞的成熟，其間必經一次减數分裂（Reductiod　division），减數分裂的結果，卵子和精子細胞中，祗留賸原有染色體數目的一半。也就是設：在精原細胞和卵原細胞裏，染色體是雙組（2n）的，到分裂爲成熟的精子與卵子時，染色體减少一半，只留賸單親（n）的了。這具有單組染色體的卵子與精子，如經配合受精，受精卵裏的染色體恢復爲原有的雙組了。</p>
<p>營單雌生殖之卵，有一類是經過減數分裂的，故成熟卵內只具單組染色體。有一類則並不經减數分裂，仍保有雙組染色體。卵子經减數分裂與否，是染色體或爲單組或爲雙組的關鍵所繫；而染色體組數之單雙，直接影響于子裔的性別決定。所以就細胞學遣傳學觀點論，又可分單雌生殖爲單組染色體的單雌生殖，雙組染色體的單雌生殖與單雙組染色體輪廻的單雌生殖三類。</p>
<p>（A）單組染色體的單雌生殖（Hapold　parthenogcnesis）：</p>
<p>像壁蝨蜜蜂，螞蟻黃蜂之類，其單雌生殖之卵，在成熱以前，照常經過减數分裂，此種具半數染色體的卵發育而成之子裔，多半是雄性的。所以也不妨這樣說，單組染色體的單雌生殖，大概是雄裔單雌生殖，例如在：（一）壁蝨類中之Tetranychus　binocnlatus，據1923年許拉竇（Schrader）氏的研究，雌體的未受精卵，單獨發育，只能成爲雄裔。他曾檢查卵原細胞內有六個染色體（雙組），而在成熟卵內，祗有三個染色體（單組）。由此可證這樣的單雌生殖所產子裔爲雄性的原因，是由於染色體是單組的關係。如果雌體所產之卵子與精子配合受精，則由受精卵發育成之子裔，大都是雌性。因爲受精卵細胞裏恢復了雙組（六個）染色體了。似乎難於索解的是由於此類單雌生殖之雄裔，旣是只具單組（三個）染色體，那麼牠將來身體內之精原細胞，分裂成熟爲精子時，是否須再經减數分裂呢？要是再經减數分裂，染色體　不是要逐代遞减下去，愈過愈少嗎？事實已經證明此種雄裔所產之精虫，在其成熟過程中，不再行减數分裂。而雌體卵子的成熟過程中，總是經過减數的。所以單組染色體的單雌生殖，只能產生雄體，而由受精卵所演發的子裔常是雌體。復次再可以考察一下蜜蜂的生殖情形：（二）蜜蜂的集團中，有雄蜂雌蜂和工蜂三類，雌蜂和工蜂都是雌性（但工蜂是不能生育之雌蜂，除非在集團中的蜂后猝死後，可變爲雌蜂，產卵發育成雄蜂）雌蜂一切細胞核裏的染色體是卅二個（2n），雄蜂一切細胞核裏的染色體是十六個（n）。當離蜂的卵原細胞經成熟分裂之際，須經减數分裂。故成熟卵內所有之染色體，只賸有十六個了，以這樣具有單組染色體的卵，演發而成之子裔總是雄性。而精卵配合受精後所演發之子裔常爲雌性。關於蜜蜂生殖的研究，最稱詳盡的要推梅維思（Meves）和奈赫嵇姆（Nachtschein）了。梅維思於1901至1907年，嘗研究蜜蜂和黃鋒（Vsepa）的精虫發育，他不僅在精原細胞中看到十六個染色體，而且還證明精子中也同樣是十六個染色體。奈赫嵇姆於1913年證明雌蜂與工蜂均具雙組染色體，其數目爲卅二個，而雄蜂只具單組染色體，其數目爲十六個。雄蜂之精子成熟分裂時，在初級精母細胞時，有近乎减數分裂的舉動，但實際並未减數，結果只排出一無核之極球，故精虫內仍得保有十六個染色體。</p>
<p>上列兩例，不僅說明了單組染色體的單雌生殖所以演發成雄裔的道理，同時也說明了這些動物營兩性的配合生殖時，其演發所成之子裔常爲雌性的道理。（朱完）</p>

<h3>愚人過年</h3>
<p>— 白永</p>
<p>上海俗　：「王小二過年，一年不如一年。」我鄕則有一句話曰：「傻子過年，—看街坊。」街坊者，鄰里也。人雖至愚，豈有不知過年者？其原意不過說凡事可以效法智者耳。但在今日，則過年只有看街坊之一道，我輩賣文糊口者，殆是談不到過年二字矣。</p>
<p>東鄰是宰牛爲生的，原甚困迫，自從秋天從外埠販運牛肉，到本埠以高價售出，利市數倍，便漸漸改了樣子，由低頭皺眉一變而爲揚眉吐氣。最近以前，從鄉下整批運來水牛，賣了之後，再拔還牛價，於是賺錢益多，生活益關，女兒買了新大衣，太太買了新戒指，少爺自稱小開，父親當然老板，脾睨之狀，令窮酸胆寒，而且手揚支票及自店本票，一揮毫間，數千萬金，出出入入，端的驚人。可是最近幾天，情形頓時大變，鄉人來討牛價的滿院都是，咒駡連聲，哭涕盈耳，老板是長吁短嘆，小開是避不見面，局外人莫明其妙，似約略可以明白是把人家的牛賣了錢，而自已花了，到如今付款無着，只好拆別人爛汚。</p>
<p>西鄰是開煤店的，原在煤行言伙計，日本人來了，老板逃走，他便占了這爿店，居然經營得法，去年一年間，賺了幾千萬，今年當然得以億爲單位，雖然目不識丁，可是打起馬將來，一擲千萬無吝色，兒子也不再讀那百無一用的中學，而在店裏管起賬來。碰見人，總免不了一句：「念書，有啥用塲，還是作生意有道理。」</p>
<p>南鄰是某高級行政機關的簡任官，住的是公家配給的一間宿舍一妻二子，可是竟連棉衣服還沒弄周全。六十歲的老人，天天在外面借債，若不是有公家配給麵粉，吃飯早就成了問題。如今，過年先不談，兩個孩子的學黃先得一千萬，足够他皺眉一個月的了。</p>
<p>醃魚臘肉是掛在別人的窗櫺上，今大買柴，明天買米，吃年夜飯，貼春對子，小囝們今天一套新衣服，明天一頂新帽子，爆竹放得乒乒乓乓，鑼鼓响得可可噹噹……</p>
<p>你能不受年的威脅？你能說一句：「世亂民貧，過什麼年」？是我們自貧，於別人有什麼關係？傻子若是不看街坊，至少不會知道是過年，看了人家過年，而自己無年可過，才是一個大大的　扭。在諺語的意思，乃是說傻子未嘗無力過年，只是不知該如何過耳，如令則是知而不能行，而又不是自已不會行，乃是「柴米油鹽醬醋茶，般般都在別人家」，不傻也得裝傻，不愚且須佯愚。前詩後兩句所說的暢達語句：「我也一些愁不得，且鋤明月種梅花」云云，大約只有聖人才修養得到，再不然便是十足道地的阿Q，我輩凡人而又逼於「强　一之下，不禁感到自身的渺小危殆，於此急景殘年，實不覺其牢騷與悲苦之相侵也。</p>
<h3>論重典</h3>
<p>— 任微音</p>
<p>連日多事，亂源未除，很多人自然而然的談到「用重典」的問題上，並且牙　　的，恨不得馬上來個什麼法兒，把這「亂」的局面澄淸。</p>
<p>「治亂世，用重典」的思想　自商君書，商鞅韓非以爲人性日向惡劣的方向走，要醫治那風行一時「因利乘便」的病，不得不用嚴厲的刑　，但並不是以重典爲能事。韓非說：「明主立可爲之賞，設可避之法，故賢者勸賞，而不肖者少罰。」又說：「明君之行賞也，　乎如時　，百姓利其澤，其行罰也，　乎如雷霆，神聖下可解也，誠有功則難疏必賞，　　　，則　　愛必　。」韓！當時，「民主」的省詞尙付　如，但他說賞　如時雨，使百姓判其　，法如雷霆，神聖下　　，　　現代的法律精神。　　　　的思想，原是　老子　來的，老子談政治，主　「爲之於　　，始之於卡亂」，故說：「　用兵者，無赫赫之功。」不必於事後圖補救，應於其先作疏導，王　註老子，說他是「順自然而行，不造不始。」旣已能防患於未然，更何　事後的焦急？所以老子說的：「慈故能　，　故能廣，不敗爲天下先，故能成器長。」實在是千秋萬下治家的寶典。</p>
<p>老子的時代，天下似乎沒有這樣亂，那時的道德標準尙在「忠信仁義」的階段，老子因說」禮者忠信之薄，亂之首也。」後來，竟連「禮」也不能在社會上起作用了，才談「刑罰」，才談「兵討」，韓非主張談「可邀」之罰，行「可爲」之賞，目的還是在濟世，在挽回人性。治亂世用的這個「戴典」，並不是以「刑罰」來稱快一時。</p>
<p>現在接二連三的「亂」，不免使有些人覺得當局過於寬容，「用重典」的呼聲也喧囂日上，但細味「爲政過寬」，是否也是「亂源」呢？而對於某些實際上的人民生計問題，是否已於事前作根本的考慮呢？因此，我們雖盡量支持「治亂世，用重典」的說法，但是這是有條件的，「有所爲，有所不爲」的。「兵」，究竟是「不祥之器」，非「君子之器」，不得已而用之，還以「恬澹爲主」。</p>
<p>結論仍用老子說的：「夫慈以戰則勝」，再引用諸葛亮的一句話，要使「法行而知恩」，以免再挑起更大的反感。</p>

<h3>晚餐以前</h3>
<p>— 寄漠</p>
<p>筆者在每天晚餐以前，終要自對自發一個小小的誓願，今天晚上得少吃半碗飯，因爲憑過去的經驗，吃得過飽，一丟開飯碗，往往不顧妻的忠吿，便昏昏欲睡，什麼事都不想幹了，而檯子上的時鐘，所指的時間往往還只是七鐘一刻。</p>
<p>依社會上習俗的看法，這幾天正是農曆歲暮，不但商店須忙着結帳，就是個人的私事，似乎也須有一個結束，這樣才可以準備來年的「一年之計在於春」的新計劃。</p>
<p>筆者說忙也不忙，但是有許多瑣屑事務，尙未理楚，內中似以文債居多。例如某書局特約的「××學概論，」尙未交卷，××雜誌社囑寫的短文，還未着一字，連帶　得我不敢上××社去找編輯聊天，免得他當面向我索「債」。此外，某君托我修改一篇論文，亦須在廢曆年內竣事。</p>
<p>因此，我實在非貫澈在本文開端所述的小小的　願不可，胃中不讓它太飽，終可以將疲倦的感覺逐去，開上一晚夜車吧。</p>
<p>自然，强迫自己加工作的另一項方法，也可以將晚餐的時間延遲。在晚餐前，多看些參考書或多寫幾節文字。今天我就採用了這個新主義，我一回家，躺在沙發上，正想從書架上抽閱那本厚厚的密爾斯敎授所寫的統計方法論，但是一天工作疲勞之餘，不免偸閑片刻，不自覺的抽出一本美國世界電訊日報記者史密斯氏所寫的採訪回憶錄來讀。</p>
<p>這本書記載着不少零星小故事，以關於影城者居多，例如他到過好萊塢，發現考爾門主演的桃源艷跡中號稱爲桃源的「香格里拉」的佈景，竟是一處野草叢生的土丘，又如他在美國某地上演魂斷藍橋一片時，適逢片中主角費文麗小姐，亦來該影院觀光。在他的筆下，她是一個嬌小玲瓏的女人，當時她的神經緊張，爲避免影迷的包圍計，由此公自吿奮勇，陪伴她從影院側門溜了出去，書中又稱影城中若干大明星，在四五年之中難得上紐約去一次，在沒有到過美國的人看來，似乎是一件異事。</p>
<p>我就這樣不知不覺的唸下去，一剎那間，妻張羅着我吃晚飯，原來已經八時了，鄰居人在今天吃年夜飯，送了一碗栗子紅燒鷄給我們，妻又替我端正了我所嗜吃的肉餅蒸蛋，我不自禁的超過了最初限制的食量，結果仍將我的工作，暫擱一旁，倒頭便睡，據妻第二天吿訴我，上床不到三分鐘，我就發出呼呼的鼾聲了。</p>
<h3>小雪霏霏送舊年</h3>
<p>— 雷紅</p>
<p>這幾晚臨窗伏案，馬路上的臘鼓聲敲得很熱鬧，在此急景凋年聲中，人民對於歲暮的情緒，自不能抑制一種慶祝的興懷，農曆新年的深入民心，可說歷史悠久，而且是非常合乎自然的。</p>
<p>在除夕的晚上，最容易激起的是童年的心情，離開故鄉年數愈多，便會想起好的舊日子時代：當我們還是掮着繡球燈，拉了兎子燈，無知無覺的度過一個歡愉的除夕。雖然在倦眼惺忪的深晚，儘管大人催着去睡覺，還是不肯，戀戀地攀着桌子，看母親用梅紅紙細心地包着十個銅元的紅封包，道樣的挺括，包成一個不露絲毫皺紋的封包，預備在元旦開發傭僕之需……—年鑼鼓的聲音，不時從周圍傳來，而一切封井，接　，燒天香的儀式，總是在午夜之後才舉行。我們要等待，一種莫明其妙的等待，只是覺得非常興奮，非要到漏下三鼓，才遲遲走入已經用芸香燻好，繚繞着有濃重的除夕味的房間去睡覺，此時燭臺上的紅燭，在跳躍着的火燄中已經結有燈花，象徴着明年新春之吉利。</p>
<p>今年的立春特別早，在農曆十二月廿五日日經交到立春節氣，而在立春的前夕飄着一整天臘雪，漫天飛舞如羽毛一般，農家以臘雪爲祥瑞，預卜明年的豐收。立春爲農曆中第一季節，也好說是季節的元旦，因此立春前夕的一場風雪，恰好符合了劍南詩句：小雪霏霏送舊年。放翁詩集中所收除夜律句只此一首，詩曰：</p>
<p>「野水楓林屋數橡，</p>
<p>寒爐無火坐無氈，</p>
<p>殘燈耿耿照孤影，</p>
<p>小雪霏霏送舊年，</p>
<p>椒酒辟溫傾瀲灩，</p>
<p>藍袍俘鬼舞蹁躚；</p>
<p>從今供養春薺美，</p>
<p>莫愁愚公日萬錢！」劍南翁的詩句，就是寬敞得令人可愛。像這首除夜詩，起首還不免有身世之感，因而特別在歲行將　的季節，引起自身茫茫之感，詩境似乎收得極爲狹隘，而灌注者全是個人離索的情感。但到第四句「汾舊年」起，胸襟爲之一展，「從今供養春薺美，莫愁愚公日萬錢」，豈非是「冬天到了，春天還會遠嗎」另一情緒的表示？這與兩當軒的除夕詩：「獨立市橋人不識，一星如月看多時」的不盡蒼茫之感，就覺得前者的雍容豁達了。放翁詩中多樂觀精神，如「貧甚不爲明日計，興來又作少年在」，如「雨餘千疊暮山綠，花落一溪春水香」，如「素衣莫起風塵歎，猶及淸明可到家」，……固不僅是除夜一詩爲然。</p>
<p>若是在今日的都市裏，人們究竟是幸福的，在每年冬季，可以渡過兩個歡愉的節日，屬於洋式的是聖驚；馬於國粹的則是陰曆新年。而以後者更接近民間，差不多大家小戶都要熱鬧一下，即使在最艱困的時代，也要拂抹掉心理上的寒冷，預感到春日來臨之溫暖。說起最艱困的時代，我曾經以同題寫過一篇散文，用希望世界回復熙攘作為結束。當然其時心情非常窒息，連寫文章也要兜圈子，委宛到無以復加的地步，那時所謂熙攘，即是指的擊潰敵人獲得勝利。當然今夜草此文時，心境大有不同，但似乎萬方多難的形勢，又轉過了一頁，可是我們一定要有希望，就像今晚的除夕，渡過了舊年以後，一定有新年來臨一樣。</p>
<h3>羅宋幽默</h3>
<p>— 芳濟</p>
<p>有一次，某國的代表去謁見俄羅斯的長官官，問道：「請問你檯上的那個東西，爲什麼要這樣放置呢？」</p>
<p>長官說：「這是我的東西，我要放在那裏就得放在那裏！」</p>
<p>代表到另一個官長的府署裏去，看見官長的椅子是吊在天花板上的，因此也就很客然的問個底細。</p>
<p>長官發怒了，他說：「這是我的椅子，我要放在那裏就得放在那裏！」</p>
<p>最後，代表遇見了史達林，將以上的兩件事情問他，史達林說：「你不要管牠吧，好在他們都是痴子。」</p>
<p>「那麼你爲什麼要用這些痴子呢？」</p>
<p>史達林震怒着說：「這是我的痴子，我要放在那裏就放在那裏，你去管牠做什麼呢？」</p>
<h3>哭貢師伯樵</h3>
<p>— 秦瘦鷗</p>
<p>好久沒有激動的憊情，今天早上又像蜂聲似的扎傷了我的心房。</p>
<p>我親炙黃伯樵老師的敎誨凡三年，後來在兩路局又繼續受他的訓導約四年；在那七年之中，幾乎沒有一天不見到他那圓圓的，潔白的莊嚴的臉龐，聽到他那獨有的淸脆的堅定的語聲。在我所已度過的三十九年的生命裏，他給我的印象的深刻，除祖父母親而外，已無第二人。所以當我在報紙上突然看到他逝世的消息時，心頭眞是非常的悲痛，尤其因爲這一二年來，由於我自己的愚魯的固執，——爲了不願看見一個我所深惡的人，以致連帶也一直沒有去拜訪他，現在是無論想什麼方法，再也見不到他的容顏，聽不到他的語聲了！</p>
<p>黃老師可說是一個眞正屬於國家，屬於社會的人。他的小我觀念微淡得幾乎沒有。他不積錢，不置什麼產業，也從不爲自已的無兒無女而感到絲毫不快。除了爲工作而注意保特他的健康以外，飲食衣着，在他簡直是可有可無的。有許多人說他缺乏感情，對於同鄉同學親戚朋友不大肯到助，這也未嘗不是事實，因爲他的興趣永遠是毫不保留地集中在他所肩負的事業上的，他所關心的永遠只是他自己的工作，當然無暇旁顧了！</p>
<p>凡戰前曾經行過京滬滬杭甬鐵路的全都心悅誠服的讚佩他的治蹟，即使是因私怨而不滿於他的人亦不能例外。他的成功別無他法，就是沒有一天，沒有一件事不認眞的做，切實的做。我敢在妄的說：如果勝利以後，政府能够請黃老師擔任行政院長，國內的一切決不會像今天這樣的糟！說他是工程專家，那未免把他太小看了！</p>
<p>黃老師所患的糖尿病和心臟衰弱是他畢生之累，照他的精神和毅力來說，他的成就是絕對不致限於現在這一點點的；而現在，又在他僅僅五十五歲時奪去了他的生命。</p>
<p>在黃老師的遺囑裏，他力主不發赴，不開弔，這仍然是他生平的一貫作風。爲了尊重他的意志起見，我覺得我輩門生故舊實在不必再送什麼花籃化圈或舉行什麼追悼會之類，我個人打算約集昔　同學，籌募一筆「黃伯樵光生紀念獎學金」，以作久遠性的追思。</p>

<h3>Chairman Chiang and Madame Arrive at Kuling, Enjoying the Scenery of Snowy Mountains, Returning to Nanjing in a Day or Two, Telegram Expresses Comfort to Wounded and Sick Officers and Soldiers</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Nanjing Dispatch, 8th] Chairman Chiang, along with his Madame, departed from Nanjing at 11:30 AM on the 8th via a special plane to Xunyang, from where they ascended to Kuling. This trip allows them to spend the Spring Festival amidst the famed mountains adorned with jade and silver carvings.

<h3>Restrictions on Japanese Textile Industry, No Agreement Reached Between China and the Allied Headquarters, Gu Weijun States Position to the U.S.</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Nanjing Dispatch, 8th] Regarding the issue of restricting Japanese industrial standards, Wang Yunwu has convened relevant ministries and commissions for discussions in recent days. China has agreed to the principles agreed upon by the Far Eastern Commission, namely that Japan's industrial standards should be based on the average living standards of the Japanese people between 1930 and 1934. However, our opinions with the Allied Headquarters regarding the interpretation of this living standard are still not consistent, especially regarding the standards of the Japanese textile industry. It is heard that the difference in opinion is still large. China advocates that the Japanese textile industry should only be allowed to retain 2.5 million spindles, while the Allied Headquarters is willing to allow the Japanese textile industry to retain 10 million spindles. No agreement has been reached yet. People in China's industrial circles have recently put forward their opinions on the standards of the Japanese textile industry, arguing that the ratio between the standards of the textile industries of China and Japan should be maintained at three to one. The maximum number of Japanese yarn spindles should not exceed 3 million. Gu Weijun, the ambassador, has informed the United States of the opinions of the Chinese government and people on the standards of the Japanese textile industry. According to a certain authoritative person, preventing Japan from engaging in aggression again requires not only restricting the development of its military industry as a necessary measure, but also imposing considerable restrictions on the textile industry, otherwise the Japanese textile industry will pose a great threat to China.</p>
<h3>Investigation of Opinions of Petition Delegation from North China, Three Supervisors Plan to Form Report, and Will Suggest Government Pay Attention to the Overall Situation</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Nanjing Dispatch, 8th] Regarding the various issues mentioned by the petition delegation from North China when they came to Nanjing, the Control Yuan previously sent supervisors Miao Peicheng, Yu Shude, and Xiao Tingsan to various relevant agencies in Shanghai to investigate the results. Subsequently, Qian Shude made an oral report at the Control Yuan on the morning of the 3rd. The obtained materials are now being compiled into an "Investigation Report on the Economic Crisis in North China and Government Measures." Miao, Yu, and Li also plan to suggest that the government pay attention to the overall situation and give the same importance to the North as to Nanjing, Shanghai, Central China, and South China. Under the broad principle of this suggestion, consideration must be given to the allocation of foreign exchange quotas for import and export, the increased production and transportation of coal mines, the overall planning of grain for people's livelihood in the North, and the maintenance and development of light and heavy industries in Peiping and Tianjin. The resources and people's hearts in the North are inseparable from the entire China, and their importance to Central and South China is self-evident. It is learned that the drafting of this recommendation letter will begin after the submission of the report.</p>
<h3>Wu Tiecheng Travels to Conghua</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency Guangzhou Dispatch, 8th] Secretary-General Wu traveled to Conghua this morning and returned to the city at noon. At 2:00 PM, he attended the welcome meeting of the American Chinese Alliance. Wu is a member of the association. In his speech, Wu said that the Premier had been engaged in the revolution for decades and had received much assistance from overseas Chinese in the Americas. At present, the revolution has not yet been successful, and we must continue to work hard to accomplish the Premier's unfinished goals. Also, according to news, Wu is scheduled to transfer to Hong Kong on the 9th and fly to Shanghai to return to Nanjing.</p>
<h3>Signed Elected National Representatives Host Reporters in Nanjing</h3>
<p>Firmly Striving for Valid Elections</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper Nanjing Dispatch, 8th] After the Liaison Association of Signed Elected National Representatives was renamed "Office of the Elected National Representatives of the Republic of China," a press conference was held on the 8th to express their opinions. First, they reported their legal status, and then explained the past petitions to the Standing Committee of the Kuomintang, saying: "We only hope that those with more votes will be elected, which is a reasonable and logical thing, but it turned out to be the opposite." The following are the paths to be taken in the future: (1) Collectively appeal to the law. (2) Publicly denounce the names of the representatives who obtained their positions illegally throughout the country. (3) The representatives elected legally by this office will all gather in Nanjing to attend the National Assembly and exercise the powers conferred by the Constitution. (4) Strengthen the constitutional protection movement of voters in various places. (5) Finally, appeal to international public opinion based on the actual situation and collectively withdraw from the party, and are currently going through the procedures.

<h3>Legislative Yuan's 12th Regular Meeting to Be Postponed</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Nanjing Dispatch, 8th] The Legislative Yuan originally scheduled to hold a regular meeting on the 12th to review the national general budget again. However, since the general budget is still waiting for the small group meeting to review it and be passed by the joint meeting before it can be submitted to the Yuan Council for discussion, it is now impossible to handle it due to the urgency of time, so the Yuan Council will be temporarily postponed.</p>

<h3>"The Chinese Communists I Know" Account After Two Foreign Missionaries Escape Danger</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency Xuzhou Dispatch, 8th] The Lu Zong has officially announced the rescue of two foreign female missionaries by the National Army in Biyang, western Henan, on the 19th of last month. One of the two female missionaries is American Hoover Mao (Chinese name) and the other is Canadian Rong Yaoqiu (Chinese name). After being driven out of the county town by Chen Geng's troops and rescued by the Luo Guangwen Division of the National Army, they jointly published an article "The Chinese Communists I Know" based on witnessing the crimes of the communist bandits. The full text is as follows:</p>
<p>After the Communist army occupied Biyang County for the third time, the situation was different from before. They quickly, without legal procedures, sent an illegal county magistrate and began to plunder those with a little savings in a brutal and enslaving manner, even using torture. Soon, this practice was applied to every class of society, and even the poorest people could not escape this disaster. We personally saw the Communist army using mule-drawn carts to transport large quantities of looted materials to their senior headquarters. This barbaric behavior was obviously allowed by the higher authorities. After this disaster in Biyang, thousands upon thousands of people will be threatened by hunger and death in the next two months, because these innocent people have been looted by the Communist army and have nothing left. After Biyang was occupied by the Communist army for three weeks, every department in the city fell under the control of the communists. They once publicly claimed that the communists advocate religious freedom, but the facts finally testified to the liars. Originally, they always "said one thing and did another." At first, we foreign missionaries did not encounter any major obstacles, and we hoped that this peaceful missionary life could continue under their supervision, but things went against our wishes, and disaster soon came upon us.

<h3>Washington Circles Value Aid to China, Considering It a New Step in Far-Reaching Policy, Fierce Debate on Aid to Foreign Countries Expected in Both Houses of Congress</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Nanjing Dispatch, 8th] According to authoritative sources, the outcome of China's reform of the currency system and the loan from the United States will depend on the passage of the $570 million aid to China bill. The plan for the use of the $570 million will be expanded according to the plan previously formulated, because this loan is paid in installments, and one part is replaced by materials, so it cannot be used to reform the currency system. According to experts' estimates, the amount of Chinese legal currency issued in November last year was 28 trillion yuan. Adding the amount issued in December and January of this year, the total amount should be around 35 trillion yuan. If there are 300 to 500 million U.S. dollars as a fund for reforming the currency system, then the reform of China's currency system can be fully prepared.</p>
<p>[United Press Washington Dispatch, 7th] The U.S. government is determined to prevent a comprehensive economic collapse in China and is preparing to allocate $570 million for this purpose. U.S. authoritative figures all said that Secretary of State Marshall's decision to propose the $570 million aid to China plan has international political significance behind the scenes.</p>
<p>[Associated Press Washington Dispatch, 7th] Diplomatic circles reported on the evening of the 7th: The government's request for $570 million in aid to China shows an important new step in U.S. Far East diplomacy. At the same time, aid to Japan will also reach $175 million, and aid to Korea will reach $75 million, so that countries destroyed by the war can economically recover.</p>
<p>Diplomatic circles here believe that the three aid plans for China, Japan, and Korea clearly represent a new decision by the State Department to build anti-communist barriers in the Far East.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency Washington Dispatch, 7th] According to today's survey of opinions from all parties here, the new aid to foreign countries plan proposed by the State Department with an estimated expenditure of 9.3333 billion U.S. dollars over 15 months (including $570 million in aid to China) will encounter strong opposition when a comprehensive debate is launched in both houses of Congress at the end of this month. The Republican Party will rise up and advocate reducing this huge figure. A certain opponent of the party said: "The American people cannot tolerate this huge figure." However, supporters of the State Department's plan expressed the hope that this appropriation could be approved on April 1.</p>
<p>[Associated Press Washington Dispatch, 7th] Senator Wheeler, the leader of the revisionist faction of the Marshall Plan, said: The government's proposed 9.333 billion aid to foreign countries plan is really unbearable for the American people, and the American economy cannot consider this figure. Xiang Wheeler said: Representatives of the Senate revisionist faction held a meeting on the 7th, chaired by Senator Vandenberg, Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, to discuss possible changes.</p>
<h3>Economic Reform Plan - Implementation Measures for Water Conservancy</h3>
<p>[Report from our Nanjing Office] Regarding the implementation measures for the Yongli portion of the economic reform plan, the National Economic Council, at its 31st regular meeting, decided to have the Ministry of Water Conservancy revise and submit a revised proposal. The Ministry of Water Conservancy has drafted new implementation measures based on the original implementation measures, and submitted them to the National Economic Council, which passed them with revisions on the 5th. The full text of the implementation measures is recorded below:</p>
<p>Original Plan B.1.(3) Agricultural reform, with water conservancy as the priority. Large-scale water conservancy projects and the construction of main canals should be actively undertaken by the state. The construction of small-scale water conservancy projects and branch canals should be supervised by the central government for implementation by the provinces and counties, with permission to issue water conservancy bonds. Completed projects shall be the responsibility of local authorities for maintenance. Implementation measures:</p>
<p>1.  River Management</p>
<p>(1) To eliminate flooding and revitalize water conservancy, emphasis should be placed on the fundamental management and guidance of rivers across the country. (2) Fundamental plans for major rivers should be based on comprehensive surveys of various data, focusing on "regulation," "storage," "diversion," "dredging," and embankment construction, as well as the development of channels, with detailed investigations, meticulous planning, and comparative designs to formulate plans. (3) Flooding from the Yellow River has been a problem since ancient times, while the Northwest regions suffer from drought. The main objectives of managing the Yellow River should be flood prevention and irrigation, supplemented by hydropower development and channel improvement, under mutually beneficial conditions. The fundamental plan should be actively prepared and completed within a specified timeframe. (4) The fundamental plan for the Yangtze River should prioritize navigation and hydropower, while still considering flood control and irrigation benefits. This plan should be completed as soon as possible, and important tributaries should be planned in coordination, with priority implementation. (5) Fundamental plans for the main waterways and tributaries involving more than two provinces or municipalities should be formulated and implemented by the central government, prioritizing them based on importance and urgency. Fundamental management of minor waterways will be managed by local governments. (6) The responsible authorities for river embankments should pay attention to repairs and strict defense to prevent embankment breaches. Local administrative officials should organize the public, gather labor and materials locally, and be responsible for participating in the work. (7) Embankments damaged during the war that have not been fully repaired should be urgently repaired to reach one meter above the highest flood level. (8) Culverts and sluice gates damaged during the war should be repaired immediately. Those that have not yet been built should be constructed quickly to facilitate drainage. (9) Silting rivers and waterways blocked during the war should be dredged and managed separately.</p>
<p>2.  Implementing Irrigation</p>
<p>(1) State allocation of funds for project implementation. A. In accordance with the provisions of this plan that "the construction of main canals should be actively undertaken by the state," the government should improve existing large-scale irrigation projects and actively allocate funds for new irrigation projects based on the needs of the people, with particular attention to irrigation projects in the Northwest provinces. B. The funds needed for irrigation projects should first be allocated by the government from the farmland water conservancy fund for irrigation work. Starting from the year following the completion of the project, the provincial government should collect water fees from the benefited fields on a yearly basis, in accordance with regulations, to repay the principal and interest for cyclical utilization. The collection methods and standards shall be determined by the Ministry of Water Conservancy in consultation with the respective provincial governments. C. The review standards for irrigation projects should be based on the principles of complete planning, superior benefits, convenient construction conditions, and short completion time. D. Project implementation shall be carried out in the following two ways: (1) The central competent authority shall be responsible for construction; (2) The local government shall be responsible for construction. E. After the completion of the project, the local government should manage and maintain it in accordance with the "Irrigation Project Management and Maintenance Regulations" promulgated by the Executive Yuan on September 19, 1944. F. The water fees collected by the provincial government for completed irrigation projects, in addition to being used for management and maintenance expenses, should be used to repay the work funds allocated by the central government and then used to replenish the local farmland water conservancy fund.</p>
<p>(2) Implementing projects with farmland water conservancy loans. A. In order to actively carry out new irrigation projects, the Farmers Bank of China should, starting from 1948, increase farmland water conservancy loans in areas where irrigation needs to be urgently developed, and make every effort to utilize the cooperative societies of various provinces and counties to promote well drilling and pond digging loans. B. Projects that have not been completed in various provinces should be accelerated and completed within a specified time limit. Completed projects should be properly managed and maintained, and the principal and interest should be repaid in kind starting from the year following the completion of the project. C. Loan procedures should be simplified as much as possible to meet construction needs. The approval of next year's loans should be completed one month before the start of the year. After the loan is approved, it should be fully allocated at one time, and the use of the loan should be strictly supervised, and the current loan interest rate should be reduced so that various places can universally carry out irrigation projects. D. After the loan is granted, various provinces should quickly establish sound construction institutions and complete the projects as planned within the time limit.</p>
<p>(3) Supervising local implementation of irrigation projects. A. According to the provisions of this plan that "the construction of branch canals should be supervised by the central government for implementation by the provinces and counties, with permission to issue water conservancy bonds," the local government should, based on the needs, apply for the issuance of water conservancy bonds as a local farmland water conservancy fund. For irrigation projects that have been completed in various provinces, counties, and cities, whether utilizing loans or funded by the state, the local government can also collect fees based on the amount of benefited acres, as a local farmland water conservancy fund. The aforementioned fund can be managed and utilized by a fund management committee established by the local government. B. Provincial, county, and municipal governments should utilize idle labor to universally construct irrigation projects and dig ponds. C. Larger irrigation projects that cannot be built by the people themselves can apply to the local government for a loan from the local farmland water conservancy fund or apply for a farmland water conservancy loan from the Farmers Bank of China. The local government should also provide assistance as much as possible. D. For completed irrigation projects, people should be urged to manage and maintain them in accordance with the irrigation project management and maintenance regulations.</p>
<p>3.  Managing Waterways</p>
<p>(1) To develop shipping, attention should be paid to the management of waterways, the opening of canals and harbors, and the connection of water and land transportation. (2) In managing waterways, priority should be given to trunk lines that have important economic value for transportation or can be coordinated with other water conservancy construction. (3) In opening canals, priority should be given to those that connect two adjacent river systems. (4) In opening harbors, they should be coordinated with the water and land transportation network, and harbor projects that are intertwined with water trunk lines should be implemented first. (5) Waterways and harbors damaged during the war that have not been repaired should be completed immediately, and the depth of the channel should be maintained to at least the required standard. (6) Waterways that have been managed during the war should continue to be managed and maintained separately to ensure long-term use.</p>
<p>4.  Developing Hydropower</p>
<p>(1) The development of hydropower should be coordinated with flood control navigation and irrigation projects of various rivers. (2) The selection of factory locations should be coordinated with the needs of industry. (3) In the initial stage of water conservancy projects, the Southwest provinces should be prioritized for development, with emphasis on the Hunan, Guangxi, and Guizhou areas. (4) Water conservancy projects in the Northeast should be temporarily based on the demand when controlled by the enemy. (5) In Taiwan, in addition to projects that should be restored immediately, projects that have not yet been completed should be reviewed for necessity and selected for resumption. (6) Water conservancy projects in other regions should be developed based on the needs, prioritizing them based on urgency and importance. (7) Private hydropower projects should be handled by the competent authorities in accordance with the "Measures for Encouraging and Assisting Private Hydropower Industry" approved and promulgated by the Executive Yuan on May 20, 1944.</p>
<h3>Implementation Measures for the Transportation Sector</h3>
<p>The original Plan Four of the economic reform plan, implementation measures for the transportation sector, has been reviewed and completed and was also passed with revisions at the National Economic Council on the 5th. The full text is as follows:</p>
<p>(1) The management of commercial ports shall be determined by the Ministry of Transportation, in accordance with the needs of water transport, and the important and secondary commercial ports along the coast and inland rivers shall be separately designated and announced. The important commercial ports shall be built, managed, and operated by the Ministry of Transportation in accordance with the provisions of the Commercial Port Regulations. Secondary commercial ports may be operated by the provinces and municipalities after being approved by the central government, and the central government shall provide economic and technical assistance. (2) For the dredging of waterways, the Ministry of Transportation shall, for the needs of navigation, divide the inland waterways of the country into several regions, coordinate with the commercial port construction plan, and after being approved, the waterways directly connected to seaports shall be dredged by the Ministry of Water Conservancy. The waterways within one province shall be dredged by the municipal and county governments. (3) Increasing the tonnage of private shipping vessels. China's shipping policy has always emphasized both state-owned and private operations. In the future, private shipping should continue to be encouraged to meet the Ministry of Transportation's plan to increase vessels to 1.5 million tons. The Ministry of Transportation shall separately formulate detailed assistance measures for the maintenance of existing vessels, the construction of new vessels, the salvage of sunken vessels, the encouragement of domestic shipbuilding industries, and the improvement of shipping management, so as to achieve results.</p>

<h3>On This Year's National General Budget (Part 1)</h3>
<p>— Zhang Baiyi</p>
<p>Because the nurturing government's policies are about to be implemented, the current transitional government cannot formulate this year's policy guidelines. Therefore, the national general budget for this year is only prepared for the first half of the year, that is, January to June of this year is temporarily used as the fiscal year, and the budget figures are used in accordance with the budget and additions of the previous year. According to the report of Premier Zhang of the Executive Yuan to the Legislative Yuan on the 5th of this month and the results of the review by the joint meeting of the Legislative Yuan, the total budget amount is 962,766,000,000,041 yuan, and the total budget amount of revenue (excluding debt income) is 583,408,969,700 yuan. We are quite optimistic about the above-mentioned total budget amount. If the total revenue of this year can account for more than 61% of the total expenditure, from the perspective of the principle of balanced revenue and expenditure, it must be said that the financial situation is gradually tending to be on the right track.</p>
<p>According to the Nanjing special dispatch of Shen Bao on January 14: "Director Xu of the Directorate General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics and Minister Yu of the Ministry of Finance stated that this year's budget will not use the inflation policy to make up for the deficit, and will try its best to ensure that there will be no additional budget. The deficit will be made up by reforming the tax system and increasing the special donation for relief." If the government authorities can truly fulfill this guarantee, then it would not be an exaggeration to say that the prospect of this year's budget is gradually becoming optimistic.</p>
<p>However, we must consider several preconditions for the budget for the first half of this year: First, is the total budget expenditure of more than 96 trillion yuan sufficient to represent the true meaning of the national finance for suppressing the rebellion and building the country? Second, is the total budget expenditure for this year really guaranteed that there will be no additional budget? Third, does the current system of tax collection and expenditure of public funds guarantee that there will be no continued waste due to corruption? Fourth, is there no need or possibility of continuing to implement the public debt policy? Fifth, is it necessary to reform the micro-collection technology of state-owned property income? Sixth, is it necessary to thoroughly reorganize the large amount of domestic public debt accumulated by the government over the years? According to my research, in order to free China's finance from the shackles of the old ideas of the established financial school of "finance for finance," in order to thoroughly reorganize China's finance before and after the reform of this currency and establish a permanent and sound foundation for the future, and in order for the Chinese government to use financial power to achieve the goal of suppressing the rebellion and building the country, special consideration must be given to the aforementioned six issues when preparing this year's budget, so as to seek an overall solution. Based on my research, I would like to explain and suggest the causes, meanings, and solutions of the above six issues below, for the reference of government leaders, legislators, and financial experts for joint research.</p>
<p>Regarding the first issue, whether the total expenditure has the meaning of national finance for suppressing the rebellion and building the country. It cannot be denied that China's finance at this time is indeed wartime finance, and at the same time, it must also be finance for building the country. This is no different from the finance for resisting Japan and building the country during the War of Resistance Against Japan. War has no distinction between domestic and foreign, and finance has become a link in participating in the war. Recalling the words of British Chancellor of the Exchequer David Lloyd George during World War I: "We will, like Napoleon in wartime, must obtain the final victory over our financial strength." Also, during World War II, British Chancellor of the Exchequer Sir John Siman also made a famous statement in his first budget speech: "Finance is the fourth convoy of national defense. If finance fails, the entire power to support the war will collapse immediately." This is enough to prove the close relationship between finance and war and the importance of finance in wartime. If there is no war, then so be it. Once there is war, there is no distinction between domestic and foreign. This rule must not change.</p>
<p>At the same time, one of the main tasks of the government in building the country is to complete the industrial plan in Dr. Sun Yat-sen's plan for building the country. Chairman Chiang of the National Government also proposed a ten-year economic construction plan in his book "China's Destiny" based on the industrial plan. During the War of Resistance Against Japan, we did not forget to build the country. During the period of suppressing the rebellion, we should not forget to complete the economic construction on the industrial front. During the War of Resistance Against Japan, it was precisely because we advanced in both resisting Japan and building the country at the same time that we were able to resist for a long time and achieve the final victory. During this period of suppressing the rebellion, its dangers are no less than the Japanese imperialism's invasion of China with a puppet government. Therefore, at this time, we must advance in both suppressing the rebellion and building the country at the same time, so that we can combat the second kind of puppet, which is more dangerous and hateful, and so that we can resist the intrusion of the emerging imperialist forces into China for a long time. And the important means of completing the construction of the country must rely on financial strength. For example, American financial expert Professor C.C. Plehn believed in his book "The Theory of Financial Policy" that "Soviet finance is the lever of the five-year economic plan." From this, it can be seen that finance is also the main driving force for economic construction.</p>
<p>Therefore, finance, whether in terms of war or construction, occupies the most important position. Today's finance is by no means finance for finance. Today's finance should be finance for enriching the country and strengthening the military. According to my knowledge, the government's financial policy seems to be intentionally or unintentionally restricted by the criticisms and accusations of vulgar economists or political economists, and often takes a conservative tendency. Therefore, what is expressed in the financial policy is to follow the old ways, that is, to deal with each situation, only treating the head when it hurts and treating the feet when they hurt. This tendency must be thoroughly eliminated; otherwise, the work of suppressing the rebellion this year will not be fundamentally ended, and if there is no foreign aid, it may also lead to difficulties in finance itself, which will affect the entire military, political, and economic situation. Now, let's first study the problem of the total amount of the budget expenditure for the first half of this year, which is 96 trillion yuan. The actual value of the legal tender is definitely not as low as the market standard, but today's price increase has reached 15 trillion, which is a fait accompli. Before the legal tender continues to roam the market and does not return to the bank for deposit, most of the government's expenditures will probably have to be based on the market price standard that has become a fait accompli. If the national general budget of 96 trillion yuan is converted into only about 600 million yuan of pre-war legal tender, and if the whole year is estimated based on this standard, it will only be 1.2 billion yuan. The pre-war budget in our country was also about this number, but at that time the area for suppressing the rebellion was very small. Therefore, it is pointed out that it is necessary to consider increasing the total expenditure of 96 trillion yuan. At the same time, according to my plan, if the government wants to end the important part of the work of suppressing the rebellion this year, its military expenditure must be increased to account for 50% of the total expenditure; if the government wants to implement Chairman Chiang's ten-year economic construction plan this year, its construction expenditure must be increased to account for 25% of the total expenditure; if the government wants to increase the living expenses of civil servants and teachers this year to stabilize their lives and improve administrative efficiency, its living expenses for civil servants and teachers (living allowances for military personnel are included in the military expenditure) must be increased to account for 10% of the total expenditure; if the government wants to repay all domestic debts and foreign currency public debts issued in the country this year, the debt expenses must account for 5% of the total expenditure; other political expenses will account for 10%. Therefore, the budget and content I suggest should be as follows: the total expenditure for half a year is 150 trillion yuan, of which military expenditure is 75 trillion yuan, economic construction expenditure is 37.5 trillion yuan, civil servants' living expenses are 15 trillion yuan, other political expenses are 15 trillion yuan, and debt expenses (domestic debt) are 7.5 trillion yuan. Military expenditure includes military pay and combat materials. All education expenses related to economic construction are included in economic construction expenditure, and debt expenses are prepared for one-time repayment of various wartime and post-war bonds (the reasons will be detailed later).</p>
<p>We must pay attention to the importance of ideological warfare in the position of war. Increasing the living standards of the army can develop and enhance combat power; increasing the living standards of civil servants can strengthen administrative efficiency and reduce corruption.</p>
<p>In the 25th year of the Republic of China, on the eve of the War of Resistance Against Japan, when the National Government prepared the budget for the 23rd year of the Republic of China, in order to enrich the national strength, it specially formulated a five-year plan and raised special funds for construction. The budget was divided into two types: ordinary expenditure and construction special funds expenditure, just like the United States during the economic recovery period, dividing the budget into two major items: ordinary expenditure and recovery and relief expenditure (Generol Expenditures and Recovey &amp; Relief Expendilures). At that time, the construction special funds were listed as 400 million yuan, accounting for about one-third of the total budget at that time. Therefore, I now propose 37.5 trillion yuan for economic construction expenditure (equivalent to 250 million yuan of pre-war legal tender), accounting for 25% of the total amount, similar to the plan for the 23rd year of the Republic of China.</p>
<p>Some people may say that if this huge budget is put into practice, it may still be compensated by issuing a large amount of currency, and it will cause more vicious inflation. However, I have considered this, and the amount is not too large. It can be met with sufficient financial resources, and there is no need to rely on issuance. This point will be discussed later.</p>
<p>Now let's look at the second issue, that is, whether this year's budget guarantees that there will be no additional budget. Since the outbreak of the War of Resistance Against Japan until this year, the annual budget expenditure and the actual expenditure of the national treasury have not been able to meet. The reason for this is that the continuous rise in prices over the years has caused the government agencies to constantly increase the numbers paid by emergency orders, or to supplement the additional budget procedures according to law after the emergency order, or to no longer make this additional procedure after the emergency order funds are received, so that the actual expenditure of the national treasury has greatly exceeded the budget. Without mentioning the builders, take last year as an example. The total expenditure budget for last year was 9.32 trillion yuan, but the actual expenditure of the national treasury reached 40 trillion yuan by the end of December, exceeding it by more than three times. Whether this year's budget can guarantee that this phenomenon will not occur again depends on whether prices are stable at today's standard of 150,000 times as a prerequisite. According to Minister Yu Hongjun of the Ministry of Finance, it is guaranteed that this year will definitely not use issuance to make up for the deficit. This is indeed a wise statement and promise. If the deficit is not made up by issuance, then the cycle of government expenditure, price increases, and currency inflation can be eradicated. However, I believe that this promise alone cannot achieve the perfect goal. We must use the relationship between finance and finance to maximize the power of absorbing idle funds and controlling national purchasing power in order to achieve the expected results.</p>
<p>Here, we should pay close attention to the deposit problem of national banks, bureaus, and libraries and commercial banks and villages across the country. According to the survey of the Four Joint Offices, the statistics of time deposits and savings deposits of national banks, bureaus, and libraries are as follows: (1) The total amount of time deposits was 46.3 billion yuan as of the end of June last year, but there were 685,146,000 yuan at the end of 1937. (2) The total amount of savings deposits was 725.3 billion yuan as of the end of June last year, but there were 188,488,000 yuan at the end of 1937. (3) The total amount of trust deposits was 184.4 billion yuan as of the end of June last year, but there were 26,458,000 yuan at the end of 1937. The above total time deposits (including trust deposits) and savings deposits totaled 956 billion yuan, which was about 1 trillion yuan by the end of last year. However, this deposit was more than 900 million yuan at the end of 1934. At that time, 900 million yuan was converted to today's market price, which is about 135 trillion yuan today, and this huge amount of deposit is equivalent to the full annual budget of the Chinese government before the war. And today's 100 million yuan of national bank deposit in legal tender is calculated to be only 6.66 million yuan of pre-war legal tender. From this, it can be seen that at the end of 1937, the national banks and bureaus controlled and utilized as much as 900 million yuan in deposits, which was especially important for controlling national purchasing power. If today's national banks, bureaus, and libraries can have the power of 135 trillion yuan of legal tender (that is, equivalent to 900 million yuan of pre-war legal tender deposits), then the control of national purchasing power will be extremely effective. Today is not what it used to be, which is obviously visible. In other words, today's national banks, bureaus, and libraries have lost their banking functions, and they can only helplessly sigh at the sight of the people's purchasing power!</p>
<p>At the same time, we want to look at the deposits of commercial banks and villages across the country. According to the Central Bank, as of September last year, time deposits were only 417.1 billion yuan, and demand deposits were 2421.8 billion yuan, totaling 2838.9 billion yuan. By the end of last year, time deposits were estimated to be 800 billion yuan, and if converted to pre-war legal tender at 150,000 times the price, it would be only 5.33 million yuan. However, at the end of 1937, the commercial banks and villages had 652,150,000 yuan in interbank deposits in the national banks and bureaus.</p>
<p>According to the above figures for time deposits (including savers and trust deposits) of national banks, bureaus, and libraries and commercial banks and villages across the country, the total was 1.552 billion yuan at the end of 1937, and in fact it was only 12 million yuan at the end of 1947 (converted to pre-war legal tender according to market prices). The multiple of decline is about 129.5 times, that is, the value of time deposits at the end of 1947 is less than 8 per thousand of the total amount of time deposits at the end of 1937.</p>
<p>If we take the total amount of time deposits of public and private banks and villages at the end of 1937 at the beginning of the War of Resistance Against Japan as the standard of 1.552 billion yuan, and convert it to today's legal tender at today's market price, then the amount of time deposits of public and private banks and villages today should be 232.8 trillion yuan, but the fact shows that it is only 1417.1 billion yuan. This fact is enough to prove that today's national financial institutions, regardless of national banks, bureaus, or commercial banks and villages, have completely lost their original banking functions. The so-called rampant speculation of idle funds today is actually the result of a large number of bank deposits escaping from the bank and roaming the market. It is not the so-called idle funds. At the same time, it can also prove that today's price increases cannot be entirely blamed on issuance, because today's issuance by the Central Bank is definitely not this number.</p>
<p>As the agency for implementing the national general budget, the Ministry of Finance must pay special attention to this fact now that the budget for this year has already begun, and especially for this problem, it must immediately implement policies and measures that are targeted at reality and make effective solutions. In this way, the emergency order payment book will no longer continue to appear in this year's budget, and in this way, the additional budget can be stopped, and in this way, this year's budget can be controlled.</p>
<h3>What I Know About the Chinese Communists</h3>
<p>[Continued from Page 1] That illegally appointed county head, with his hideous face and venomous heart, came personally to our church and even rushed into my bedroom. Using the tone of an autocratic ruler, he ordered us to leave Biyang immediately. But you must understand, in the Communist-controlled area, a person cannot "take a single step" without their "passport," and it's even harder for foreigners. At that time, he only allowed us to have a "travel permit." This "travel permit" had no special protection whatsoever; it only stated the reason for our expulsion, "which was merely their pretext." On the morning of January 19th, two or three Communist government officials came to inspect the limited luggage we were allowed to carry and forced us to set off at noon. At that time, we learned a terrifying piece of news from others: the Communists were planning to bury us alive on the road after we left the city. Simultaneously, we received information that the Nationalist army had arrived not far from the city. The illegally appointed Communist county head sent people to force us to leave, but those helping us with our luggage deliberately delayed, obviously aware that the Nationalist army was arriving soon. It wasn't until 3 PM that everything was prepared and we were just about to leave when suddenly we heard gunfire outside the city. This was the signal that the Nationalist army had arrived in Biyang. Now it was our turn to watch the Communist Party's antics. The Communist soldiers ran around in chaos, trying to find a place to hide their true colors. Later, that illegally appointed county head and the villains who were lying in wait outside the city to bury us alive were all captured alive by the Nationalist army. We thank God for the omnipotence of the Nationalist army that rescued us. When the Nationalist army entered the city, we received a warm welcome from all the townspeople. That genuine and enthusiastic emotion surpassed even the joy we felt when Japan surrendered! After we were rescued, everyone advised us to leave this turbulent place temporarily. The Fourth Army Commander General agreed to allow us to travel with the army to Queshan. We traveled with the army for five days, receiving their courtesy and assistance. The officers and soldiers of this unit were all suffering greatly, moving through the icy and snowy conditions. Some soldiers had no shoes or socks, and sometimes food was not available. However, the officers and soldiers of the army still faithfully carried out the orders given to them by the government; no matter where they went, the officers and soldiers were so polite to the people, engaging only in fair buying and selling, never infringing on the people's interests. We sincerely pray that the officers and soldiers of the army striking against the Communist Party will be strong and victorious.</p>

<h3>Sudden Turnaround in Japanese Political Situation: Katayama Cabinet Set to Resign En Masse This Morning; Various Parties May Form Coalition Cabinet</h3>
<p>[New Asia News Agency, Tokyo, 8th] Japanese Prime Minister Katayama, in order to unify the Socialist Party internally, had already decided to implement the resignation en masse of the cabinet yesterday, but he had not obtained the consent of the ministers. As a result, the effort was postponed to today. After striving to persuade the ministers, it was decided to hold the final cabinet meeting at 9:00 AM tomorrow (9th) to formally announce the resignation en masse of the cabinet.</p>
<p>[New Asia News Agency, Tokyo, 8th] The Japanese political situation took a sudden turn for the worse today, breaking the chaotic situation of the past few days. The Katayama Cabinet has announced its resignation en masse. As such, the issue of the next cabinet is attracting considerable attention from observers. The possibility of a second Katayama Cabinet or a coalition cabinet of the Liberal and Democratic parties is extremely low. Based on the current situation, the possible outcomes are: a united national cabinet of various parties (Ashida as Prime Minister); a Central New Party cabinet (Ashida as Prime Minister); and a national salvation conservative new party cabinet (Yoshida as Prime Minister). However, since all three cabinets would exclude the Socialist Party from the cabinet, the organization work is quite difficult. Judging from the attitude of the members of various parties toward the next regime, the Democratic Party accounts for the largest number of supporters of a united national cabinet of various parties, with 95 members, the National Cooperative Party with 36 members, the All Farmers faction with 16 members under possible conditions, the First Member Club with about 8 members, the Farmers Party with 7 members, and unaffiliated members with 5 members, for a total of 159 members. If the Socialist Party does not split and supports this cabinet as a whole, there will be a total of 282 members. Even if the left wing splits and removes 50 members, it will still reach 232 members, which is enough to control more than half of the current total of 446 members. Secondly, for the Central New Party Cabinet, in addition to the direct line of the Ashida New Party, about 20 members of the Democratic Party who have withdrawn from the party, and other small factions will support it in the same way as the First Club. Also, the Socialist Party will not split, and the left wing has already stated that it will not support it, so its supporting forces are about 223 members, which accounts for about half of the current total number of members. This is the maximum number. Among the All Farmers, First, Farmers, and other factions, there are still about 10 members who are questionable. As for the national salvation conservative cabinet, with the entire 119 members of the Liberal Party and the entire 22 members of the Comrades Club as the core, about 40 members of the Democratic Party will participate, and the All Farmers and Farmers factions will participate under possible conditions. The First Member Club will have 8 members, and there will be 1 unaffiliated member, for a total of 213 members. Taken together, the possibility of a coalition cabinet of various parties is the greatest, followed by the Central New Party Cabinet. The feasibility of a national salvation conservative new party cabinet led by Yoshida seems to be weaker. However, if the Socialist Party's left wing splits and takes independent action, the supporting forces of these two or three parties will be no more than 120 or 130 members, and the departure of small factions and the possibility of the emergence of a Yoshida-led cabinet will be the greatest. In this view, the key to the political situation is now in the hands of the left wing of the Socialist Party. Therefore, the trend of the next political situation after the resignation en masse of the Katayama Cabinet also depends on the attitude of the left wing and its unity.</p>

<h3>Gandhi Assassination Case: Conspiracy Group Cracked</h3>
<p>Alwar State Suspected of Involvement, Under Investigation</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, New Delhi, 7th] It is reported that during the investigation into the assassination of Gandhi, the Indian detective team has cracked a nationwide conspiracy group that attempted to assassinate the highest leaders of the Congress Party and its ministers. It is said that nearly 20 people joined the assassination group, including Sikhs and natives of Punjab and Bombay provinces. The team also discovered a storage site for military supplies, bombs, grenades, revolvers, and machine guns. In Delhi, more than 200 members of the All-India National Servants Society and the Hindu Mahasabha have been arrested. The hunt for assassination groups in other cities is still ongoing. The Standing Committee of the Hindu Mahasabha will soon convene to discuss the reorganization of the association to reduce its anti-Muslim characteristics and perpetuate the new situation created by Gandhi's death.</p>
<p>[United Press, New Delhi, 7th] The investigation into the assassination of Gandhi reached a critical point today. The Indian government has taken over the state of Alwar and summoned its ruler and prime minister to New Delhi for preliminary investigation. The announcement stated that this emergency measure was necessary for a successful investigation, as the state government is accused of supporting or acquiescing to the actions of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), which may be implicated in the Gandhi assassination case and other major crimes. The state's Maharaja Tej Singh and Prime Minister Jiram Rika have arrived here and have been ordered to stay for at least one month to facilitate the investigation. The Indian government has appointed Van Cataysha as the interim administrator of the state. The state covers 3,158 square miles and has a population of one million.</p>
<p>[Reuters, New Delhi, 7th] The Indian Postal Service has decided to issue Gandhi commemorative stamps starting next month, in denominations of two and a half annas and twelve annas.</p>
<h3>Building an Anti-Communist Fortress in the Middle East: Truman Doctrine Should Be Extended to Iran; House Foreign Affairs Subcommittee Proposes</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 7th] The House Foreign Affairs Committee's subcommittee stated on the evening of the 7th that the United States will "seriously consider" extending the anti-communist military aid program for Turkey and Greece to Iran. The subcommittee stated that the United States should take steps to achieve air superiority, so that in the event of an incident, it can quickly move to defend the Middle Eastern oil fields. What Iran needs is for the United States to assist it in building its 100,000-strong army into an effective fighting force. Currently, Iran is very vulnerable to invasion. The committee issued this report after learning that Iran had rejected the Soviet Union's protest on the 6th. The Soviet Union had protested to Iran about the United States' improper activities in a country with an important strategic position in the Middle East. The State Department denied the Soviet claim. The report was signed by Congressmen Bolton (Republican) and Millo, who traveled to the Middle East last summer. The report stated, "In terms of American interests and security, we should seriously consider the issue of Iranian military buildup, so that the country can actually obtain the same status as Greece and Turkey." Under the so-called Truman Doctrine, the United States gave Greece $300 million and Turkey $100 million last year. Greece was able to use $173 million for its military, while the aid to Turkey was entirely military in nature. The United States has stationed military missions in both Turkey and Greece to help them build up their strength as anti-communist fortresses. According to the State Department, Iran has not yet requested such assistance, so there is currently no consideration being given.</p>

<h3>General Eisenhower Relinquishes Military Position, Will Write Memoirs</h3>
<p>To Provide for Family Living Expenses</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 7th] Eisenhower, who relinquished his position as US Army Chief of Staff on the 7th, stated that he has abandoned his fishing vacation and will begin writing his memoirs immediately. At a farewell press conference at the Pentagon, he stated that he plans to use the time before assuming the presidency of Columbia University on June 7th to write his memoirs, so that his family's living expenses can be covered. General Bradley will succeed him as Chief of Staff, and he offered three suggestions: (1) The salaries of soldiers in Korea and remote islands in the Pacific should be increased, otherwise it will affect the recruitment of new soldiers. The army is already 100,000 men short of the legal limit, and this reduction will continue; (2) The Women's Auxiliary Corps is scheduled to end completely on June 30th, and Congress should urgently pass a bill to keep it in existence, otherwise the future of the army will be in grave danger; (3) The treatment of officers from Lieutenant to Colonel should be improved. Regarding his memoirs, Eisenhower stated: He intends to write things that his conscience allows, otherwise there is no need to publish them. This is the only opportunity in his life to think about his family. People in the military, whether enlisting or retiring, are all impoverished.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 7th] General Eisenhower today handed over his position as Chief of Staff to General Bradley. President Truman, cabinet members, senior generals, and British Army Chief of Staff General Morgan were all present at the ceremony. General Eisenhower has dedicated 33 years to the military. After retiring, he will have a two-month vacation to contemplate the outline of his memoirs.</p>
<h3>Reasons for the Decline in US Prices: Grain Prices Fall, Department Stores Reduce Prices; Currency Fluctuations in Various Countries Also Have an Impact</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, New York, 7th] Various countries are paying close attention to the trend of US prices. Therefore, the point of attention everywhere is "whether the recent sudden drop in US prices and stocks is a harbinger of the collapse of the American economy." It is still too early to make a definitive statement on the shadow of this matter, but most financial experts believe that this is a good adjustment in the US price struggle, and there is no sign of recession. Most businessmen believe that the drop in prices can produce a psychological force and prevent prices from rising again. There are indeed many economic reasons for the recent drop in US prices. From the supply side, food production in Europe, South America, and the United States has greatly improved. American farmers who hoarded grains in December last year due to tax issues are selling off their inventories for fear that prices will continue to fall. At the same time, the supply and demand in the commercial sector has gradually become balanced. From the demand side, it is believed that Congress will reduce aid to Europe, and the price of grains is higher than the price of meat, so the demand for livestock grains has decreased due to consumer resistance. Grain prices have also fallen due to the reduction in the price of livestock feed. The decline in prices has also been affected by the UK's automatic freeze on wages and profits plan, and the revision of currency values in the Soviet Union, Italy, and France. Some observers believe that the large fluctuations in prices are sufficient to indicate economically that inflation may have reached saturation. This downward trend is beneficial rather than dangerous to the United States. The high cost of living in the United States will fall as a result, making more American goods available to other countries. At the same time, if the reduction in the price of American goods is realized, then the unions will not be able to claim that the cost of living is high and demand wage increases. The threat of a third strike in the United States due to demands for wage increases will be greatly reduced. A certain financial expert also believes that the United States' efforts to maximize production this year will greatly benefit the correction of inflation. The Vanguard Forum believes that the fall in the price of agricultural products will definitely cause the price of stocks to fall. All businessmen's actions are more or less influenced by tangible and intangible psychological shadows. The fall in the price of agricultural products will cause the price of retail food to fall, and the fall in the price of retail food will cause the price of industrial products to fall. From this point of view, the fall in the price of stocks and goods will be a regulatory effect, without causing disturbing shadows in the market.</p>
<h3>West German New Charter Takes Effect Today</h3>
<p>German Parties Oppose East-West Split</p>
<p>[United Press, Frankfurt, 7th] West German parties stated on the 7th that the constitution of the limited autonomous government in the British-American occupied zones is just another action to permanently divide Germany. West German parties have abandoned their infighting and unanimously agreed that the charter given by the British and American occupying authorities is tantamount to sowing the seeds of a West German government, causing western Germany to be permanently divided. The United States and Britain gave the Germans a charter in their occupied zones on the 6th, allowing them to establish a limited autonomous government. This is the first step in restoring order to Germany after more than three years of chaos. The charter will take effect on Sunday.</p>
<h3>South Korean Situation Remains Serious: Organized Riots Cause Disturbances Throughout the Country; 150 Koreans Arrested</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Seoul, 8th] The riots that occurred throughout South Korea yesterday seemed to have subsided this morning, but the US military and Korean police remain vigilant against new riots. Korean rioters and Korean police clashed fiercely yesterday. It is reported that 10 to 13 Koreans and 4 Korean policemen have died. Police reports state that another 7 policemen and 3 rioters were injured, and 2 policemen were kidnapped by rioters. The police have arrested 150 Koreans and are interrogating them. It is claimed that there were a total of 105 incidents throughout South Korea yesterday, including riots, destructive actions, demonstrations, and strikes. They appear to be extremely well-organized riots. The most severely disturbed areas were the port of Busan and Daegu. It is claimed that the South Korean Labor Party (the successor to the Communist Party) is quite strong in these two places. As a result of the destructive actions, between approximately 50 and 61 locomotives were damaged because parts were removed. Telephone lines and transportation routes have been cut off in many places. Seoul was relatively quiet yesterday. The "Dong-A Ilbo," a right-wing newspaper, was attacked by rioters, but suffered only minor damage. An American sentry here was pelted with stones by Koreans last night, but the sentry fired a shot into the air and dispersed the rioters. Pyongyang Broadcasting Station, controlled by the Soviets, took advantage of the unrest in South Korea and broadcast last night that all the people of South Korea have risen up to protest against the United Nations delegation to Korea.</p>

<p>Autumn is the Most Dangerous Season in Europe</p>
<p>President Roosevelt agreed to convene the leaders of both parties in the Senate at the White House on the evening of July 18, 1939. At this meeting, the President and I planned to make a final appeal in support of the bill to abolish the arms embargo in the Neutrality Act—Editor, News Service. If this appeal failed, we would hold the opposition responsible for the events that would occur after the bill's failure to pass. The President and I both felt that we had to make one last and greatest attempt to make the Senate leaders fully aware of how serious the danger would be to our country's future if war broke out in Europe. When the meeting began in the President's study upstairs, the atmosphere seemed quite harmonious on the surface, but the inner emotions were tense. Among those present were Vice President Garner, Majority Leader Barkley, Pittman, Minority Leader McNary, Minority Whip Austin, and William E. Borah, a minority member of the Foreign Relations Committee.</p>
<p>The President began the discussion by first mentioning Senator Nye's extreme isolationist views, explaining that these views were hindering the passage of our measures in the Senate. Borah interrupted the President rather quickly, waved his hands, and said, "There are others, Mr. President." The President, somewhat surprised, turned and asked, "What are you saying, Senator Borah?" Then Borah repeated, "There are others, Mr. President." Subsequently, the President and Borah had a conversation during which Borah vehemently opposed the lifting of the arms embargo and tried to make his point that, at least in the near future, war would not occur.</p>
<p>Then the President turned to me and said, "Cordell, what do you think the chances are of danger ahead?"</p>
<p>I tried to restrain my emotions and earnestly replied, "If Senator Borah could see just a few of the extremely serious cables concerning the international situation that have been sent to the State Department, I would be satisfied if he revised his views."</p>
<p>Then Borah, in a forceful and absolutely unchangeable tone, said that he had sources of information from abroad, and based on his judgment, these sources satisfied him that war would not occur in Europe in the near future. He seemed to imply that this information was more reliable than what the State Department had received.</p>
<p>Recently, I have noticed that some things have been published that are said to be about Senator Borah's memorandum of this conversation. I do not want to discuss the exact wording of the conversation at that time, but I must state that Borah's words created a definite and unshakeable concept of the situation at that time in my mind, as I have just stated. President Roosevelt also indicated more than once that he had gained the same impression from Borah's words.</p>
<p>In my past experience, I have never found it so difficult to restrain my emotions, so difficult to avoid a spontaneous outburst of emotion. From the high stacks of official documents in the State Department, I knew that Borah was thoroughly wrong; we saw very realistically the imminent danger of the total outbreak of war, which might come before the end of summer—and I certainly said so. Borah's statement that he valued private news more than the State Department's news was a slander against our entire diplomatic effort.</p>
<p>After the other leaders of both parties unanimously expressed the view that the repeal of the embargo could not be passed by Congress, the President turned to me and asked, "Cordell, what do you think of the situation?" After Borah expressed his opinion of myself and the State Department, my emotions were on the verge of eruption. When I answered the President, the agitation in my emotions was largely not hidden. I said, "In the situation where Senator Borah casually dismisses all the facts of the State Department, I simply don't know what to think, and all the facts we have completely negate his theory that war will not happen." I was so deeply convinced that the danger was imminent and so indignant at the impudence of disregarding all the facts and considerations that it was simply impossible for me to continue speaking without losing my self-control. At midnight, when the meeting ended in this atmosphere, the White House issued two communiqués. The first stated that the unanimous opinion of the Democratic and Republican members present was that any action on neutrality could not be realized in this session of Congress, but that the matter could be considered in the next session of Congress. The other said: "The President and the Secretary of State maintain a firm position, believing that if the Senate cannot take action at present, then if a new crisis in Europe occurs between now and January next year, the leadership of the United States in using its potential to maintain peace in other countries will be weakened."</p>
<p>Only five weeks later, we had to use this power to make a final effort to prevent war in Europe. In Hitler's view, our power had undoubtedly been weakened by Congress's refusal to follow the government's leadership, and at the same time, he believed that Britain and France could not obtain weapons, ammunition, or aircraft from the United States, which was also a reason for our power being weakened.</p>
<p>As soon as the meeting ended, Senator Borah denied any intention of damaging my dignity or my official position in any way, and Senator McNary also followed him in expressing this. But it was impossible to apologize after damaging the dignity of the State Department I led. I received these deniers coldly. I admitted that Borah had the best intentions, but I was forced to say that he was so emotional that his thinking was unclear.</p>
<p>I had often invited Borah to the State Department so that I could show him the messages sent by our diplomatic missions in Europe and Asia and discuss the general situation abroad with him, but he had never condescended to do so. If he could have come to the State Department when discussing the neutrality issue, what could I have shown him? Among dozens of other reference materials, there were also these:</p>
<p>Our Chargé d'Affaires in Berlin, Kirk, telegraphed me on May 13, stating that although the diplomatic representatives of many other countries did not expect Germany to take immediate action against Poland, they were extremely pessimistic about the chances of avoiding conflict. The general impression among foreign military circles in Berlin was that Germany was militarily capable of taking action against Poland at any time. On June 24, Kirk reported that rumors about unusual troop movements and continuous military activities within Germany had created a general impression that Germany was preparing for some event.</p>
<p>On May 16, Ambassador Bullitt telegraphed from Paris that Daladier had expressed the opinion that peace might be able to survive June, but he was not optimistic in his overall view. A month later, Bullitt telegraphed that Foreign Minister Bonnet had told him that although Germany would not launch an aggression immediately, he was certain that there would be a major crisis before the end of the summer. On June 28, Bullitt telegraphed the opinion of the Polish Ambassador to France, that the possibility of war occurring between Poland and Germany in mid-August was 80%. On June 30, Bullitt telegraphed the belief of the French Foreign Ministry official Léger, that in mid-August a crisis of the most serious nature was unavoidable.</p>
<p>On May 31, Polish Ambassador Potocki told me that Hitler would be forced to take some step in some direction in the coming months. On June 26, Potocki informed me that his country was intensifying its war preparations to prevent Germany from launching a war. I expressed the opinion to him that the situation in Europe was not good. Ominous signs and situations were appearing more and more. Sooner or later—no one could say when—in a situation in Europe that was so highly coordinated on a war footing, extremely serious things were very likely to happen, unless something could be done at the same time to avoid them.</p>
<p>On June 27, Ambassador Kennedy telegraphed Halifax's views from London, stating that the situation in Germany was extremely volatile, and the chances of difficulties occurring before the end of next month were very high. On July 5, Kennedy telegraphed that Halifax had told him that Britain was gathering ships and naval personnel reserves, ostensibly to prepare for exercises in August, but actually to prepare the navy a month before difficulties arose, at which time it was assumed that difficulties would occur in September. On June 3, our Chargé d'Affaires in The Hague reported the opinion of Admiral Versteegh, Chief of Staff of the Dutch Navy, that Hitler might engage in war between mid-August and the end of the month, after completing the harvest. Versteegh also mentioned that the German side was harvesting crops as quickly as possible, which had been noted by the Dutch side. In addition, we constantly received reports from our foreign diplomatic missions on European developments, stating that Germany was continuing to exert pressure on Poland and was making various gestures to seize Danzig, while also explaining the various difficulties in immediately concluding an Anglo-Soviet agreement, although British diplomacy had been working towards this goal for several years. All this information, Borah and his colleagues could have seen, if they wanted to. But Borah preferred to rely on a minor news agency in London; as it later came to be known. This was the last vigorous struggle of the powerful isolationist movement in the United States, continuing to fight by all possible means while still in a crisis. But after the war broke out in Europe, it could no longer hinder any proposal of the government. No one can say for certain whether our failure to repeal the arms embargo was a final, or even an important, factor in Hitler's final decision to go to war. But I am convinced that if the arms embargo could have been lifted in May, June, or even July of 1939, he would certainly have taken this factor into account. I also believe that our failure to repeal the embargo encouraged him to move forward, and furthermore, Foreign Minister Ribbentrop's assurance that Britain and France could not truly help Poland, and even if they did, they could not be very effective because the United States could not give it material assistance, was also a stimulus to Hitler. On July 20, Bullitt telegraphed the President from Paris, stating that opinions in London and Paris both believed that Hitler's decision to launch a war in August had increased due to Congress's delay in taking action on the Neutrality Act, and British Deputy Foreign Secretary Vansittart believed that war would occur in August, betting on it two to one.</p>

<h3>France's New Consul General in Shanghai, Bouffanars, Arrives in Shanghai Yesterday Afternoon</h3>
<p>The newly appointed French Consul General in Shanghai, Mr. Bouffanars, along with his wife and sons and daughters, a party of seven, arrived in Shanghai from Kunming via Hong Kong on the "Deutsch Poel" liner. He arrived at noon yesterday. Those who came to the port to welcome him included representatives from the Shanghai Office of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and many senior officials from the French Consulate. (The photo shows the Consul General and his wife and sons and daughters after arriving in Shanghai, taken by the China News Agency)</p>
<h3>Homebound Passengers Line Up to Buy Train Tickets; Long Snake Turns into a Coiled Dragon; North Railway Station is Jam-Packed; Regularly Maintains a Record of 100,000 People; Railway Police and Military Police Serve All Night; Taking Advantage and Cheating is Unpreventable</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] The lunar New Year is so deeply rooted in the lives and customs of the Chinese people that it seems it can never be abolished. Travelers living in Shanghai need to return home to spend the New Year and have a precious reunion with their families. The two railway bureaus have prepared early based on past experience, such as adding homebound trains on both lines and adding carriages to the original passenger trains, but they still cannot cope with the crowded passengers. Yesterday and the day before yesterday, more than 100,000 tickets for various stations on the two lines were sold at the North Railway Station, more than 40% more than the normal number of passengers. Especially after 8:00 PM every day, the North Railway Station is always jam-packed with homebound passengers. A large third and fourth-class waiting room cannot accommodate the shoulder-to-shoulder passengers. Later arrivals have to queue at the door. Because the single-person queue is too long, passengers naturally change the single long snake formation into a folded coiled dragon formation, and the large courtyard is also crowded to the brim. It takes at least 20 minutes to walk the short dozens of yards from the gate to the ticket office. According to informal estimates, from 7:00 PM to 1:00 AM yesterday and the day before yesterday, the entire North Railway Station regularly maintained a record of 100,000 people, including those sending off passengers, buying tickets, and boarding the train.</p>
<p>Passengers who could not buy tickets came up with a clever idea and rushed to window number 4 to buy platform tickets and mixed into the carriages, preparing to buy tickets later. As a result, the number of freeloading passengers on each train greatly exceeded the original quota. Although the sale of platform tickets was immediately stopped, there were still many who took advantage of the moment when the railway police at the ticket gate shifted their gaze and jumped over the iron fence and slipped onto the platform. There were too many people, and it was really impossible to prevent them.</p>
<p>The number of soldiers hitching a ride also increased significantly, and the joint office of military police was naturally more difficult to deal with. The night before last, an officer surnamed Kong took his wife and children to Zhenjiang. He went to the joint office to ask for half-price tickets. His son was lost in the crowd, and his wife was crying anxiously. She reported it to the police section. Fortunately, the railway police helped him find his son, but when he turned around, he couldn't find his wife. He was so anxious that he jumped up and down, shouting and clamoring to the stationmaster for his wife. A nun wearing a large monk's robe also came to buy a ticket. She squeezed back and forth in the crowd, sweating profusely. The front of her robe was suddenly torn in half by a strong passenger. She wanted to grab him to negotiate, but he had already disappeared. She had to admit that she was unlucky.</p>
<p>Many passengers who did not want to squeeze planned to go back in the first few days of the New Year. Therefore, the Railway Bureau originally planned to reduce the number of trains from the first day of the lunar New Year to allow the hard-working engine personnel to take turns resting for one or two days. This plan may have to be changed because of this.</p>
<p>The information desk was particularly busy. Miss Shi Keming, who was on the night shift these days, constantly answered various questions for passengers, and her throat was hoarse. Director Chen Bochang and Deputy Director and Transportation Department Director Xie Zhen personally inspected the station the night before last. Seeing this situation, they decided to temporarily add irregular passenger trains and mobilize all trains to carry the remaining passengers on the two lines. At 12:30 AM, 2:00 AM, 6:00 AM, and 1:00 AM yesterday, additional special trains were added to Wuxi, Changzhou, Nanjing, and Hangzhou, but the maximum carrying capacity of each train was only 2,500 people, because the luggage of the homebound passengers was very heavy, which affected the load of the train. For the sake of safety, passengers were absolutely forbidden to climb on the roof of the train. The railway police of the police department and the stationed military police also served all night.</p>
<h3>New Operetta: Intricate Plot, Altering Numbers on Checks, An Yu Zhuang Cheated Out of Huge Sum</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] Recently, a new operetta case of altering checks and being cheated out of 160 million yuan has been discovered in the city. The details are quite intricate. Recently, Dafa Food Company collected a sum from Maochang Stock Company, the amount being 1.65 million yuan. Maochang immediately issued a six-day check from An Yu Qian Zhuang and paid it in full. After Xu Jiyan, a collector from Dafa Company, took the check, he happened to meet a man wearing a velvet robe next to the escalator of the building. The man claimed that he had cash and was willing to exchange the check. Xu did not suspect anything and counted the money in person, and there was no shortage. After the exchange, the man left.</p>
<p>When An Yu Qian Zhuang was settling accounts yesterday, it was discovered that Maochang's account was overdrawn too much. After inquiring, it was discovered that the 1.65 million yuan paid on the sixth had turned into 160 million. They reported it to the Huangpu Police Sub-Bureau. After summoning the staff of Dafa Company, they learned the details of the exchange of notes at that time. When the original ticket was re-examined, it was found that the reader had wiped the ticket with "color fading spirit" and then rewrote the huge number with a black pen. The money house was negligent for a while, and was cheated. The case is currently being investigated by the bureau.</p>

<h3>Traitor Ink Dancers: Seeking Narration for a Moment with Fine Words and Regular Script</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] Among the traitor criminals, there are several who like to write and dance with ink. Each time they ask the warden for a special meeting, they present reports in meticulous small regular script with gorgeous words. Because their writing is both affectionate and literary, they often get the warden's approval. For example, the recent report by the former puppet ambassador to Japan, Cai Peizhi, was written in the style of the Lingfei Sutra, and the text was in parallel prose. For example, one section: "In my declining years, I am imprisoned, feeling like a swaying candle in the wind. My family is scattered and homeless, thinking about how they will live. Just this moment of narration is enough to comfort my sorrowful feelings."</p>
<h3>Huang Boqiao's Remains to be Cremated Today</h3>

<h3>Renaming of the Air Transport Brigade; Executive Yuan Approval Pending</h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] The former Air Transport Brigade led by Flying Tiger General Chennault, is currently temporarily called the Civil Aviation Transport Brigade. Its English abbreviation remains CAT. The proposed Chinese name is "Air Transport Team Directly Under the Civil Aviation Administration of the Ministry of Transportation." However, the new name is still awaiting approval from the Executive Yuan. Once approved, the new name will be adopted. The team has been established for one year, averaging 4 million pounds of materials transported per month. Our government has approved the team to use a total of 19 aircraft, but only 18 are frequently used, and the average number of aircraft flying daily is only 12. Therefore, the materials currently transported are all urgently needed in various regions. The Air Transport Brigade's flight operations are currently busy with transportation to and from Beiping. The team has a one-year contract with the government. According to the person in charge, they will continue to work hard on the transportation of relief materials to assist China's needs.</p>

Once approved, they will be issued temporary business licenses to resume operations. It is expected that the first batch of gold shops to resume business will be realized before the Lantern Festival. The Gold Shop Workers' Union has now begun registering employees. The union will collect the information and send it to the trade association for selection and employment.</p>
<h3>Pre-Marital Health Checkups; Hope to Promote and Encourage</h3>
<p>In order to promote eugenics, improve the race, and prevent hereditary diseases, the Health Bureau has decided to promote pre-marital health checkups. It has already notified the municipal hospitals and district health clinics to provide free physical examinations to young men and women who request them before marriage and issue beautifully printed health certificates. If any hereditary diseases or defects are found, they will be advised to seek immediate treatment and marry after recovery to avoid harming the other party and their descendants. According to Health Bureau Director Zhang, who told a reporter from the Ta Kung Pao: Pre-marital health checkups are mandatory in European and American countries, but in our country, due to different customs and concepts, we can only promote pre-marital health checkups on an advocacy basis. We plan to start with group weddings, hoping that all organizations that organize group weddings will do their best to promote and encourage citizens participating in the wedding to actively undergo examinations.</p>

<h3>Government Reform is Determined; Deeply Hope for Strengthened Sino-American Cooperation; Zhang Jia'ao Speaks at the Annual Meeting of the American Chamber of Commerce in the United States</h3>
<p>The American Chamber of Commerce in Shanghai held its 29th annual meeting the night before last. Zhang Jia'ao, Governor of the Central Bank, was invited to attend and deliver a speech, which lasted for 30 minutes. Zhang first analyzed the social and economic environment of our country, explaining that as long as we seize the opportunity, use it for the benefit of the people, and add the assistance of friendly countries, we can smoothly complete the reform plan. Finally, he addressed the American businessmen in China, deeply hoping that we can cooperate effectively with each other. The text of Zhang's speech is published below:</p>
<p>From this annual meeting, we recall the achievements of your Chamber of Commerce in the past 29 years for this city and our country, which have been significant. Your enterprising spirit and dedication to business make me deeply believe that we will have more important assistance on the path of working together for national construction. History is formed by the accumulation of human wisdom and struggle. Due to the modern ideas and spirit of peaceful competition you have brought, good results have been produced in China. However, the evolution of history is not as smooth as we would like. Twists and turns are inevitable. Even if there are setbacks, we must not doubt the victory of progress and truth. Since China has had a history, dynasties have changed every few hundred years, and internal unrest has occurred every few decades. After a destruction, the larger one takes one or two decades, and the smaller one takes four or five years, and then gradually recovers. Because the rural society of unorganized individualism, on the one hand, does not have the means of concentrated production to destroy it, on the other hand, everyone can exert their full energy, and on the third hand, the region is vast, and transportation is inconvenient, so the destruction of the war is only limited to one part, and on the fourth hand, the standard of living is low, and the people are brave enough to endure hardship. In this Second World War, China received assistance from the Allied countries, especially the various sacrifices of the United States. Fortunately, with minimal preparation, it achieved victory. In fact, the above factors are still important reasons for winning the war. I deeply believe that although we are encountering extremely serious difficulties today, the active recovery power of the Chinese people and the passive resistance power of natural conditions are sufficient to prevent the overall collapse and shorten the recovery time. If we have the courage to overcome this short-term obstacle, it will not be a problem. However, the seriousness of the situation today cannot be ignored. After eight years of resistance against Japan, China has experienced internal unrest, resulting in unprecedented inflation, which has been imposed on the people and created the current military force of civil war, which is world-class and more thoroughly destructive. It not only wants to thoroughly destroy all existing means of production and transportation, but also wants to destroy all personal freedom and spontaneity, and use propaganda with persuasive power to destroy China's old social organizations and traditional concepts, that is, to destroy the free recovery power of the Chinese people and the resistance power of natural conditions, making inflation unstoppable and making recovery more difficult. In this situation, in order to increase its own resistance and shorten the post-war recovery time, it has to rely on external assistance. Whether it is a country, society, or individual, it cannot make progress without a strong enemy. Today's communist threat is giving the National Government and the general public great stimulation. In the past, military and political organs and the public did not pay attention to organization or efficiency. Now, it is necessary to improve efficiency and be thoroughly honest. In the past, the concept of valuing cities and neglecting villages must now be changed to building villages and raising the living standards of farmers. In the past, the general upper class emphasized material enjoyment, and in the future, it is necessary to talk about equal enjoyment. In the past, the undisciplined actions of the army hindered politics and despised the people. In the future, it is necessary to coordinate the military and the government and integrate the military and the people. If the National Government can be healthy, so that the communist side knows that the Chinese people cannot be defeated by force, then the Communist Party will have a day to abandon the military. Because no matter what country, society, or individual, it cannot increase the speed of progress without advanced people working side by side, learning from each other, and observing. Today, the prerequisite for American aid is the self-help of the aided country, which is the greatest driving force for promoting the progress of backward countries. The Chinese people have always emphasized individualism. Since the Anti-Japanese War, they have fought alongside the great powers and have received deep assistance from the Allied countries. At the national level, they feel more enthusiastic about international cooperation. At the people's level, due to the spread of American soldiers in the Anti-Japanese War, the relationship between people has become closer, but this is only emotional and has not yet reached the level of practical work cooperation. If American aid is successful, it can take this opportunity to increase the degree of cooperation in practical work, so that the government can quickly reform and the entire people can get the opportunity for real cooperation in practical work. Therefore, I believe that the difficulties China is encountering today and the sacrifices the United States will bear can give the greatest help to China's reform and reconstruction in the next few decades. The success or failure of everything depends on how we seize this opportunity and use it. President Zhang announced ten points of internal affairs reform for the purpose of coordinating the effectiveness of American aid, and has notified the US government. These ten points include: (1) Manage and regulate government expenditures. (2) Improve the tax system and its administration. (3) Improve the treatment of civil servants, officers and soldiers, and improve work efficiency. (4) Control the supply of daily necessities, prevent speculation, and manipulate prices. (5) Do our best to establish a base fee that will stabilize the currency system. (6) Improve the banking and credit system. (7) Promote exports. (8) Improve the control of imported goods. (9) Improve the land system and develop agricultural production. (10) Restore transportation and important industries and mines. The importance of these ten plans is self-evident. I deeply hope that concrete measures will be implemented one by one. I dare to believe that the government has a determination because it knows that the government has prepared a detailed implementation plan for each principle. The most basic of the ten plans is to reduce the budget balance. Since the establishment of the Republic of China, the revenue and expenditure of the Chinese treasury have always been more than 50%. It was reduced to 30% before the Anti-Japanese War and is now 70%. It is hoped that with the efforts of President Zhang and Minister Yu, the revenue and expenditure gap can be reduced as much as possible. However, under the current situation, it is not easy to reduce the revenue and expenditure gap. We must strictly manage military expenditures and other expenditures, and at the same time improve tax administration and its system. However, there are still many difficulties we face in stopping inflation. According to the budget announced in the first half of this year, the remaining revenue and expenditure gap is about 50%. I not only hope that the budget for the first half of the year will not be added, but also hope that with American aid and domestic reform, the budget gap for the second half of the year will be reduced even more. There is one thing I can tell you, that is, some of the government's plans have been implemented. For example, in order to avoid credit expansion, national banks have implemented tight lending to prevent funds from flowing into hoarding and speculation, and financial management bureaus have been established in major cities to prevent funds from flowing into speculation and manipulating the black market. Shanghai is also piloting the rationing of food, cooking oil, fuel, and sugar in order to gradually promote it in other cities. Recently, it is also planning to fully ration food in five major cities in order to distribute it fairly, and revising the management methods of cotton yarn, supplying cotton by the government and adopting a substitution spinning and weaving method to prevent prices from soaring. The policies on import and export trade and foreign exchange management have been revised. Thanks to the efforts of Chen Guangfu, Chairman of the Foreign Exchange Stabilization Fund Committee, nearly 70 million US dollars of export foreign exchange has been received in five and a half months. At the same time, thanks to the efforts of Li Ming, Vice Chairman of the Import and Export Management Committee, great achievements have been made in trade management. Now that the association is under the leadership of Huo Baoshu, it should be able to see more progress. At the same time, due to the cooperation of the Hong Kong government, the signing of the customs agreement and the implementation of part of the financial agreement, smuggling can be reduced in the future. However, all controls in China are still in the initial stage and lack experienced talents, so it is difficult to expect them to be as ideal as possible. Due to the limited supply of foreign exchange, it cannot satisfy the hopes of importers and manufacturers. At the same time, because the foreign exchange black market cannot be eliminated, and domestic prices are soaring, the wishes of exporters cannot be satisfied. Looking around at the current domestic situation, of course it is not completely satisfactory. We must make greater efforts to improve it. Some difficulties can be overcome immediately, and some must be fundamentally resolved. The former, such as the restriction of credit lending, must be coordinated with the production plan so that necessary industries can still obtain the funds they need, and at the same time, the obstacles caused by the military's involvement in transportation must be removed. The latter, such as the management of foreign exchange and trade, must wait until the currency system is stable before it can return to normal. For example, in the allocation of import quotas, the import of raw materials and machinery must be coordinated with domestic production. As for the management of major materials such as cotton yarn and cotton cloth, it must not hinder the development of private enterprises in the control. To sum up the above points, they are all urgent tasks that should be carried out now. There is one more thing, the merchants and industrialists of various friendly countries who are operating in China always feel that the Chinese government has repeatedly declared that it welcomes foreign investment, but it is often just lip service. In fact, the government is sincere, but because of insufficient foreign exchange, on the one hand, the supply of foreign exchange for the raw materials and machinery needed by foreign-funded factories is insufficient, so that the factories cannot develop as ideal. On the other hand, the profits earned in China cannot be remitted back to their home countries, so investors are hesitant to move forward. Third, importers with a long history and excellent service cannot get enough quotas, and sometimes they cannot help but be inferior. The first point is to decide the amount of materials and parts to be applied based on the factory's production plan. The second point is to hope that when American aid is successful and there is more foreign exchange, appropriate measures will be formulated to solve it. The third point is that if imported raw materials and machinery are distributed according to the production plan, those with better service conditions will naturally be able to get more transactions. I hope that we can gradually achieve various improvement goals. I hope that when you use American aid in China, there are many technical aspects that still depend on American assistance. However, China and the United States have different national conditions and educational backgrounds. How to make American methods applicable and effective in China must rely on American friends who have lived in China for a long time and have experience in Chinese affairs to do their best to assist and contribute opinions. If there are unavoidable difficulties, I hope those who are familiar with the Chinese situation will explain them well. Finally, I cannot help but mention one point to you, that is, defeatism must be eliminated. During the Second World War, China, the United States, and the United Kingdom all had several times when it seemed that they were already hopeless, but because they held on to the spirit of victory, they achieved the final victory. The difficulties we are encountering today are similar to those of the war era. Why do Chinese and foreigners have defeatism? Moreover, today we are fighting a world revolution. The United States is now shouldering the world's responsibility. Every country must sincerely contribute its capabilities, so that the purpose of American aid to various countries can be achieved. I hope that the people of China and the United States will have greater courage to shoulder a common responsibility, and I wish you all good health.</p>

<p>Speaker and his wife inspect the cold shelters and talk with refugees (photographed by this newspaper)</p>
<h3>Speaker and His Wife Care About Fellow Citizens in Distress; Inspect the Facilities of Two Cold Shelters; Refugees Claim They Are Not Full Due to the Lack of Distension of Broken Rice; Poor People Beg to Be Released After Being Mistakenly Admitted</h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] Mr. Po, the Speaker of the Municipal Council, accompanied by his wife, Ms. Tang Guanyu, and Chief Secretary Chang Quan, went to the Refugee Third Cold Shelter on Jungong Road and the Labor Relief Second Cold Shelter on West Tiyu Road yesterday afternoon to inspect the living conditions of the refugees. First, they visited the women and children's group in the Third Cold Shelter. They saw a large group of old and weak women, dressed in tattered clothes, who pulled the Speaker and his wife and other visitors, crying and complaining. They were mostly refugees from northern Jiangsu and northern Anhui, and claimed that "we only eat two bowls of rice a day, which is really not enough." The house they lived in was filthy and they slept on the ground, with only a few straws on the mattress. Some women even surrounded Mrs. Pan and said, "There is no water to drink, and no water to wash our faces." Another person said: "Yesterday, some people came to give out large cakes, and each person ate five, and some people also sent raisins." Mrs. Pan was very concerned about the lives of the refugees, asked in detail one by one, and promised to cook some vegetables immediately and send them to everyone, and discussed with the Speaker to raise more donations of daily necessities such as towels from all walks of life and distribute them to the refugees. Only the refugees Many refugees were not refugees at all, but were mistakenly pulled in. A woman with a local accent not only took out her national identity card, but also her voting certificate. She was a cigarette roller on the street, but was dragged into the cold shelter. Her husband is a small foreman and does not know that his wife is in the cold shelter. The cold shelter also does not allow refugees to go out. The illiterate and ignorant woman has no one to write a letter for her, so she can only sob. There are also two boys and girls, about ten years old, who sell tea for a living at the North Railway Station, and were also arrested. Both children have parents and have been in the shelter for nine days, but their parents still do not know where they have gone. The children also told their home address, begging the reporters to notify their family members.</p>
<p>Thinking of the Elderly Mother-in-Law at Home, Begging to Be Released</p>
<p>There was also a middle-aged woman whose clothing was not like that of a refugee. She was wearing a long cheongsam. She came to Shanghai from Zhenjiang to visit relatives, but was also mistakenly arrested. She had an 86-year-old mother-in-law and a 6-year-old posthumous child at home. She cried bitterly, saying: "Tomorrow is New Year's Eve, how can they old and young spend the New Year?" She knelt down to Chief Secretary Xiang in Changchang, begging to be released so that she could catch a car back to Zhenjiang that night. The sight was really sad. The names and addresses of the above-mentioned people whose families were mistakenly sent to the cold shelter were recorded by Chief Secretary Xiang and forwarded to the administrator for immediate investigation and release.</p>
<p>Limited to One Catty of Rice Per Person, Why Only Half a Catty Is Received</p>
<p>The Speaker then visited the dining room and the men's section. Although they did not cry like women, they also complained that "we can't get enough to eat." The Speaker immediately asked the deputy director of the shelter, Chen Wenyi, and the management staff, saying that everyone is limited to one catty of rice per day, and children also have eleven taels. Why do the refugees say that they only get half a catty of rice? He also said: the management must be improved, divided into groups and buckets, and distributed in order, so as to maintain order and prevent the strong from eating more and the weak from not being able to grab it. At the same time, drinking water is also very important, and refugees must not be without water to drink. If the funding is insufficient, you can apply for a discretionary increase.</p>
<p>It Is Questionable Whether the Authorities Issued Broken Rice</p>
<p>Later, the refugees showed the Speaker the raw rice. It turned out that this kind of rice was broken and as small as millet, only one-fifth or one-sixth of an ordinary grain of rice. It was not very expansive and was easily leaked in the sea. It is questionable whether this kind of broken rice was issued by the authorities. In addition, Mrs. Pan also said that she hoped that the management staff would issue a cotton coat as soon as they received it, instead of waiting until all of them were received before issuing them to the refugees. The number of refugees in the shelter is uncertain, and the numbers given by the people in charge are inconsistent. Some say more than 800, some say more than 700, and finally they say more than 600. In short, the impression given by the Third Cold Shelter is not good.</p>
<p>I Sincerely Hope That Restaurants and Taverns Can Provide Leftover Food and Gravy</p>
<p>The Speaker and others then went to the Second Labor Relief Cold Shelter. There were more than 200 refugees in the shelter, mostly from northern Anhui. The cotton coats and trousers were quite neat, and the houses were newly built mud houses with beds. The shelter was managed by Song Shiqiao, and the management was excellent. The Speaker and his wife praised and encouraged them on the spot. The work done by the refugees is to dredge the nearby Shajing Port, but the remuneration is very low, only 15,000 yuan is given for each earthwork mud. At the same time, because they are all young and strong workers, although they have 24 taels of rice a day, they still cannot get enough to eat because they do not get enough oil (the total monthly cost of firewood, oil, salt, and vegetables is only 80,000 yuan per person). Director Song sincerely hopes that restaurants and taverns can provide leftover food and gravy to help them adjust.</p>
<h3>Driver's Voluntary Act; Looking for Family Members</h3>
<p>In order to sympathize with the refugees' hard work in the cold winter, the working hours were slightly reduced yesterday, and a day off was given on the first day of the Lunar New Year. In addition, they requested the authorities to issue 10,000 yuan to each person today to buy pork. At that time, they also showed the rice they had received to the Speaker, and they were all grains of white rice. The Speaker and his wife were very satisfied with the management of the shelter, and immediately instructed Chief Secretary Xiang to contact restaurants and taverns, asking them to donate leftovers every day, and personally donate money to the shelter within a few days to help the refugees buy vegetables.</p>
<p>Also, A Fang, a driver of this newspaper, saw the tea-selling boy wandering in the cold shelter yesterday, and specially drove to the railway station area after the visit to find the child's parents according to the address. There were indeed people. His father was a porter at the station and was out. The neighbors thanked him repeatedly and immediately told his father to go to the shelter to bail out his young son so that the family could be reunited. This spirit of righteousness is also commendable.</p>

<p>A Firm but Not Too Firm Diplomacy</p>
<p>While Congress was debating the Neutrality Act, the ominous developments in Northeastern Europe were drawing our attention. The situation was worrying. The Soviet Union was engaged in extensive actions to establish new strategic borders for itself along the Baltic Sea. It was clearly trying to strengthen its defenses against foreign countries. However, judging by the military situation at the time, its target could not be the Allied powers, because the strength of Germany made it impossible for them to approach the Baltic Sea. Stalin clearly still had Germany in mind, and did not trust Hitler's words in the non-aggression pact signed in August 1939 any more than the Allied powers did.</p>
<p>We could sympathize with the Soviet Union's efforts to protect itself against Germany, but we were worried that its actions would further escalate the conflict in Europe.</p>
<p>After signing the agreement with Germany, the Soviet Union seemed like a catfish lying in the mud, waiting for an opportunity. In late September and October, it was able to bring the three Baltic states of Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania into its sphere of influence without using force. Through various forms of pressure, it induced them to cede several strategic bases and station 20,000 troops in each of the three countries. However, since Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania still nominally retained their governments and independence, we felt that there was no need to take diplomatic steps.</p>
<p>However, the same pressure did not work on Finland. This strong little country showed every sign of "fighting rather than giving in."</p>
<p>Our relationship with the Soviet Union was unfortunately complicated by the incident involving the American cargo ship "City of Flint." (This ship, carrying various goods bound for England, was intercepted by the German pocket battleship "Deutschland" on October 9, 1939, and taken to Tromsø in Norway, and later to Murmansk in the Soviet Union. The detention of the ship in Murmansk prompted the United States to issue a note based on the rules of naval warfare.)</p>
<p>Negotiations between the Soviet Union and Finland were underway at the time of the "City of Flint" incident, but the situation was not good. The Soviet Union demanded changes to the border and the cession of island bases in the Gulf of Finland, which Finland believed would undermine its independence. The negotiations broke down on November 13, and relations between the two countries deteriorated rapidly. On the afternoon of November 28, Ambassador Bullitt telegraphed me from Paris, informing me that the Soviet Union had just renounced its non-aggression treaty with Finland and would attack Finland in the near future. He suggested that if our government could do something in this situation, it should do so as soon as possible.</p>
<p>I immediately took this news to the President, and we immediately decided that we were willing to mediate the dispute between Finland and the Soviet Union and to intervene if they were willing. So I sent a telegram to Moscow and Helsinki, in which I said that our government was extremely concerned about the increasing tension between Finland and the Soviet Union, and said: "If the scope of the war is further expanded, causing international relations to deteriorate, it would be extremely regrettable in our view. If both parties agree, our government is willing to intervene, and will not be involved in the dispute in any way, but will only be committed to a peaceful resolution of the dispute."</p>
<p>Finland welcomed our suggestion, but the Soviet Union felt that mediation was not possible. The next day, Stalin launched his attack on Finland, including the bombing of several cities.</p>
<p>We were extremely disappointed by the outbreak of another war. After discussing the matter with the President, he issued a strong statement to the press the day after the war broke out. He said: "The people of all peace-loving countries, who still hope to maintain international relations based on the rule of law throughout the world, will unanimously condemn this new act of using force to resolve international disputes." He also appealed to Finland and the Soviet Union to avoid bombing civilians.</p>
<p>Steinhardt telegraphed me from Moscow, saying that when he presented this appeal to Foreign Minister Molotov, Molotov absolutely denied that the Soviet air force had ever bombed civilians or undefended cities, or had any intention of doing so. (Our embassy in Helsinki had sent us many telegrams listing many facts of Soviet bombing of undefended cities.) Steinhardt said that he got the impression from his conversation with Molotov that the Soviet Foreign Minister did not want a third party to mediate, and that the Soviet Union's purpose in starting the war was to quickly resolve the Finnish problem, so that it could freely deal with developments in the Balkans and the Black Sea region, or from Germany.</p>
<p>At that time, we decided to implement a moral embargo against the Soviet Union, prohibiting the export of aircraft to the Soviet Union, a measure that had already been implemented against Japan.</p>
<p>The President and I had decided long ago not to apply the Neutrality Act to the Soviet-Finnish War. In the government's position, we could not sell arms to Finland, but we did not want to prevent private exporters from selling arms, if they wished to do so. Furthermore, due to the war in Europe, our ships were already prohibited from entering the Baltic Sea due to the declared war zone. Finally, we still tried to avoid making the Soviet Union a belligerent in the legal sense. We deeply felt that the fundamental animosity between communist Soviet Union and Nazi Germany was so deep, and Hitler's ambitions were so boundless, that the Soviet Union might eventually come to the side of the Allied powers. We must proceed with caution and not force it to go in the other direction.</p>
<p>Our own unpleasant relationship with the Soviet Union can be seen in an incident that occurred in early December. Since we established diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union in 1933, our consular officials there had been subject to all kinds of restrictions, which our country would never have thought of applying to similar foreign officials. Their movements were restricted, they were constantly monitored, and their luggage was always inspected upon arrival or departure.</p>
<p>Finally, I decided to try applying the same treatment in our country, to see if this would be more effective than diplomatic protests in drawing the Soviet Union's attention to its lack of courtesy. When the Soviet Foreign Ministry applied for a "free passage certificate" (allowing the holder to be exempt from customs inspection) for a new vice-consul coming to New York, Ambassador Steinhardt in Moscow replied that we would be happy to do so if the Soviet government could issue similar documents to American consular officials coming and going. The Soviet Union refused. So Steinhardt suggested that when the Soviet vice-consul arrived in New York, his luggage should be inspected by customs officials.</p>
<p>This was done. So, on December 7, Ambassador Oumansky telephoned Assistant Secretary of State Messersmith to lodge a strong protest. We immediately informed him that the vice-consul's luggage was inspected because the luggage of American consuls coming and going to the Soviet Union was also inspected, and that we had always applied the principle of reciprocity.</p>
<p>Oumansky argued that this issue should be handled according to the most-favored-nation principle. That is, the Soviet Union would treat our consuls as it treated the consuls of any other country; and we should treat Soviet consuls as we treated the consuls of any other country.</p>
<p>But we informed the ambassador that our government had handled such matters for many years according to the principle of reciprocity, meaning that we would treat Soviet consuls as 　you treated our consuls.</p>
<p>Oumansky then asked us to confirm whether his government was accustomed to inspecting the luggage of our consuls going to the Soviet Union. Ambassador Steinhardt complied with his request and sent a series of examples.</p>
<p>Since the President was interested in this matter, I sent him a memorandum prepared by Messersmith. On December 22, the President replied in a memorandum:</p>
<p>"The memorandum you sent me on December 16 concerning the restrictions imposed by the Soviet Union on American diplomats is excellent. I think we should respond to every trouble caused by the Soviet Union with similar trouble.</p>
<p>"But when it comes to the reckless actions of more Dalin, Kalinin, or Molotov, we here cannot respond with the same reckless actions. But I think that day will come soon, that is to say, we may as well directly draw Oumansky's attention to the situation. We can tell him a little bit, that his government's failure to answer my telegram about the bombing of civilians, and the failure to allow our ambassador to communicate with the "City of Flint," are quite disregardful of the ordinary courtesy and friendly relations between civilized governments, so the President is frankly surprised and doubts whether the Soviet government considers it worthwhile to continue diplomatic relations. We stop here and do not go any further, but this is enough to make the Soviet government feel a burden."</p>
<p>We conveyed this meaning to the Soviets, but the Soviet officials' centuries-old inherited suspicion of foreigners remained unchanged.</p>
<p>A minor trouble from the Soviet side continued to give the President a headache. Steinhardt sent a telegram, informing us that the Moscow embassy would no longer be able to make long-distance calls unless they went to the central telephone office in person. After I sent this telegram to the President, he wrote me this memorandum on January 10, 1940:</p>
<p>"I am wondering if we can apply the same rules to the Soviet embassy here — or at least tell Oumansky that we want to do this. This can also be said to be human nature! FDR"</p>
<p>But later Steinhardt sent another phone call, saying that this difficulty had been resolved.</p>
<p>Although we never hesitated to speak frankly to the Soviet Union when necessary, I established a basic policy of maintaining good relations with the Soviet Union as much as possible, and never giving it the slightest impression that we were a current or potential enemy. The door to friendship was always open, and at least I was willing to get along with the Soviet Union in a compromise way.</p>
<h3>Jiangyin Discovery: A Case Within a Case. Wu Qian Gui and Other Masterminds: Murder for Money</h3>
<p>[Our Jiangyin Correspondent, 6th of the Month] Wang Songren, a resident of Huanghezui Village, Qingyang Tongqi Township, was murdered in the river in front of the Pujiayu Rice Milling Machine Boat on the night of the 18th day of the 12th lunar month. After an autopsy by the local prosecutor's office, the Criminal Police Team braved the snow on the 4th of the month and went to the countryside to investigate the clues of the case. They brought the suspects Wang Quanfang, Yao Binggen, Wu Rensong, Wang Quanbao, Cao Gu's wife and others to the city, and also uncovered a murder case from six years ago. Cao Gu's wife's husband, Cao Zaizhang, made a living by boating. Six years ago, he helped his clansman fight with his clansman's younger brother Cao Baosheng for the inherited property. He was actually bribed by Shi Sheng with money to hire Wang Quanfang and Wu Qian Gui (who is still at large) to tie up Cao Zaizhang and kill him in Jiaoxi. At that time, Cao Gu's wife was forced by the power and did not dare to speak out. Last spring, Cao Baosheng inadvertently said that he did not kill the father and son (referring to Cao Zaizhang and his son Cao Guisheng) at the same time, and now he is using this to buy people to frame them. His son is now working in Shanghai, and he returned home once the day before yesterday and went to Shanghai. Wang Quanfang also confessed that Cao Shisheng paid Wu Qian Gui to murder Cao Zaizhang. The death of Wang Songren this time was masterminded by Wu Qian Gui and committed by Yao Binggen, Wu Rensong and others, while Wang Quanbao, Wu Rensong and others all claimed that they did not know about it. The case is now being transferred to the court for investigation. The discovery of a case within a case is by no means without cause.</p>

<h3>Guangzhou Flower Market Thriving</h3>
<p>[Our Guangzhou Correspondent, 8th of the Month] On the night before New Year's Eve, the flower market here was thriving. The flower market is on Jianglan Road, where hundreds of flowers are displayed side by side, competing for beauty. Tourists gathered to appreciate them, but there were few buyers. The most precious thousand-layered peach blossoms cost as much as 150 million yuan per plant, and the lowest price was more than 100,000 yuan. However, there were quite a few people who spent tens of millions of yuan to buy a flower.</p>
<h3>Dredging the Suzhou Creek</h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] People living in Shanghai all know that there is a Suzhou Creek here, running east-west and connected to the Huangpu River. It is one of Shanghai's three major trunk rivers, and the largest part of the people's food—such as rice, oil, meat...all comes through this Suzhou Creek.</p>
<p>A few days ago, this city broke the record of the coldest climate in the past five years, which also affected the Suzhou Creek, which froze over. Rice was frozen on the way and could not be transported, and rice prices soared as a result. Fortunately, the ice melted and navigation resumed the next day, and rice prices fell again. From this example, we can see the importance of the Suzhou Creek to Shanghai, which is just like the throat to human beings, closely related.</p>
<p>Will Shanghai's throat be clogged?</p>
<p>Shanghainese all know the importance of Suzhou Creek, but few people pay attention to this Shanghai throat, which has not been maintained for ten years and may soon have problems. Rivers need to be dredged regularly, but Suzhou Creek has not been dredged for ten years. Now the riverbed has gradually become narrow, especially during the low water season in winter, rice and grain ships have not been able to be imported on schedule. If this continues, the consequences will be disastrous. Can you imagine how terrible and fatal it would be for Shanghainese if one day the throat becomes blocked?</p>
<p>The municipal government has long been aware of this serious problem, but the reason why it has not been able to move forward in the two years since the recovery is that it has no funds and is unable to do so. According to current prices, the cost of excavating soil is about 120,000 yuan per cubic yard, and the total cost of dredging Suzhou Creek is more than 300 billion yuan. Such a large sum of money is being planned by the municipal government, and the central government cannot subsidize it, so the dredging project, although important, has to be postponed for the time being.</p>
<p>Pay the upgraded tax to be used for dredging</p>
<p>How was Suzhou Creek dredged ten years ago? How was the source of funding raised? – At that time, the British Municipal Council's Dredging Bureau was responsible for the dredging work, and all the funds came from the "Upgraded Tax." The so-called "Upgraded Tax" is that all coastal land, purchased for private ownership (such as building private docks, etc.), must pay taxes to the eight companies – which is called "Upgraded Tax." At that time, this tax revenue was quite considerable. The Dredging Bureau had an agreement with our government that the "Upgraded Tax" would be collected by the Dredging Bureau and used for dredging. From 1931 to 1965, the bureau dispatched five dredgers, working day and night, to complete the dredging project. The following year, the war broke out suddenly, and the project was shelved. After settlement, there were still more than 90,000 yuan left over after offsetting income and expenditure. No one knows how this money should be returned to our government.</p>
<p>The "Upgraded Tax" is used for dredging expenses and there is a surplus, so why doesn't the municipal government continue to use it? - The problem is that times have changed and the "Upgraded Tax" is no longer as abundant as it used to be. Originally, the places along the Huangpu River that could be upgraded have already been upgraded, and the upgraded tax has also been collected to the　end. Without funding, dredging cannot be started, but the Municipal Bureau of Public Works is still doing its best in the midst of all difficulties.</p>
<p>To thoroughly solve the problem, start with the trunk river</p>
<p>Since the recovery, the bureau has done two remedial projects: (1) Dredging river channels parallel to the Suzhou Creek to reduce its carrying capacity. The completed ones include Yunzaobang, Zoumatang, Puhuitang, and Caohejing. (2) Dredging important tributaries of the Suzhou Creek to divert ships and connect parallel river channels. The completed ones include Mudu Port and Taoshupu.</p>
<p>The Bureau of Public Works has indeed made its best efforts in the above projects. They used the flour from the Executive Headquarters last year to launch voluntary labor service, and this winter they used the winter relief work relief system, which has achieved remarkable results and has also solved some of the problems. However, treating the head when it hurts and the foot when it hurts is not a solution after all. To completely solve the problem, we must start with dredging the trunk river itself.</p>
<p>The Municipal Bureau of Public Works convened a meeting with the Public Utility Bureau and other bureaus in the summer to discuss solutions, and decided that from the river mouth upwards to the Hengyun Bridge on Maigen Road, dredgers would be dispatched by the Dredging Bureau to dredge. Ships, equipment, and manpower are the responsibility of the Dredging Bureau, and the materials and cable piles required are provided by the Bureau of Public Works. The Dredging Bureau accelerated the progress of the equipment remaining　after the project　began in July last year. In the past half a year, only 160,000 cubic yards of mud have been excavated, and the total amount of soil in the Suzhou Creek is 2.6 million cubic yards. At the current speed of the Dredging Bureau, it will take 25 years to complete the dredging!</p>
<p>Twenty-five years is too long. At a meeting last month, the Shanghai Port Affairs Committee further reviewed the matter and decided to submit a request to the central government to double the collection of dredging donations attached to the Jianghai Customs, that is, to increase the original 3% to 6%, which would increase the revenue by 120 billion yuan per year. In addition to being used for dredging the Huangpu River, it can fully supply the use of dredging the Suzhou Creek. Mayor Wu expressed his strong approval of the above method, and believed that the dredging project was as urgent as a shooting star, and sent a telegram urging the central government to approve it as soon as possible. Now the reply of approval has arrived at the municipal government a few days ago.</p>
<p>A huge project will start soon</p>
<p>Once the funding problem is solved, the remaining problem is how to enrich the equipment to strengthen the project rate. After repeated discussions by the Port Affairs Organizing Committee, it was decided that the Bureau of Public Works and the Dredging Bureau would cooperate in handling the matter. The Dredging Bureau currently has two dredgers, and plans to add two mud dredgers. The Bureau of Public Works has two dredgers, and decided to participate in the work, and plans to distribute four dredgers from the remaining materials of the Executive Headquarters. Under such close cooperation, about 20,000 cubic yards of mud can be excavated every month, and the entire project is expected to be completed within four years.</p>
<p>The municipal government hopes that the Dredging Bureau can allocate two-thirds of the dredging fund—that is, 80 billion—to be used as the dredging fund for Suzhou Creek. Then the accumulated donations for four years will be 320 billion, which is just enough to complete the entire dredging project. The municipal government believes that everything is very ideal. Moreover, after the start of the project, it will be necessary to hire more than 10,000 temporary workers for a long time to be responsible for building dams, pumping water, picking mud, transporting soil, etc., which is also a good opportunity for production for the hordes of refugees in Shanghai. Therefore, dredging the Suzhou Creek is really related to Shanghai's city appearance, people's livelihood, economy, and refugee relief work.</p>
<p>Now the Port Affairs Committee is discussing the start-up steps with the Dredging Bureau. If everything goes smoothly, after the director of the Dredging Bureau, Ding Guitang, returns from Hong Kong to make a final decision, this huge project can be started immediately.</p>
<p>I hope that the dredging can be carried out smoothly as soon as possible, so that the Suzhou Creek will always serve the people of Shanghai! (Our reporter Hong Xucai)</p>

<h3>Cousin and Sister-in-law Commit Suicide on the Rails; Man's Body Split in Two; Woman's Right Foot Severed, but Rescued</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch from Tianjin, February 2nd] A severed body was discovered near a culvert inside the Tianjin Main Station of the Beining Railway the day before yesterday evening. Upon receiving the report, Left Baorong, the police chief of the Railway Sub-Bureau, immediately led officers to investigate. They also discovered a young woman on top of the culvert, with her right foot severed. She was holding the upper half of the body and wailing, her voice hoarse and weak, until she fainted. After the officers separated the body, the woman still tightly clutched the deceased's felt hat. The woman was immediately sent to the Railway Hospital. After an autopsy, the deceased's body was temporarily claimed by the local guarantor, Wang Zhupo, for temporary burial, while also notifying the family members to come and identify the body.</p>
<p>After the woman was sent to the Railway Hospital, doctors performed surgery, amputating the severed foot. Her condition improved, and she gradually regained consciousness. However, she refused to disclose the reason for the incident. She only claimed that the two siblings came to Tianjin from Beiping to visit relatives but were unsuccessful, leading them to jointly commit suicide. Later, after the Tianjin Municipal District Court Prosecutor's Office sent someone to inquire in detail, the truth was revealed. It was a tragic love suicide on the rails.</p>
<p>According to the woman: Her surname is Ma, her given name is Fenghua, she is from Beiping, 21 years old, and resides at No. 6 Tayuan, outside Deshengmen, Beiping. The deceased's name is Huang Wenxiang, 19 years old, and he is her cousin on her aunt's side. The two are close relatives and have been in love secretly. Huang had proposed marriage to his parents, but was rejected, causing him to become depressed and harbor suicidal thoughts. On the morning of the 30th of last month, Huang met his cousin on the street, and they went together to Zhongshan Park, not returning all night. The next day, they took a train to Tianjin and stayed at the Tianjin Hotel next to the Dong Station. In the evening, they went out together to find a place to die.</p>
<p>After leaving the hotel, Huang Wenxiang and Ma Fenghua wandered by the railway, and the idea of committing suicide on the rails arose. It was already dark, and the two hugged each other and lay down on the tracks. When the train came, it hit the woman's head, turning her body around, resulting in her survival. At that time, she did not see her cousin and called out his name, but there was no response. She crawled in front of the train tracks and found half of his body, then held it and cried loudly.</p>
<p>Although Ma Fenghua has been rescued, she refuses to eat in the hospital and is determined to starve herself to death for love, and has instructed not to inform her family.</p>

<h3>Armored Vehicle Department Established at Ordnance School, Headed by He Xuzuan</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] The Army Armored Corps School of the Ministry of National Defense is the nurturing center for the nation's mechanized units. During the War of Resistance Against Japan, it was realized that the various armored vehicles needed on the front lines had to be supplied by foreign countries. The small quantity of them affected the organization, tactics, and operations of our army. Therefore, it was decided to establish a College of Armored Vehicle Engineering, headed by Dr. Xiang Renlan, the former Dean of Studies of the Northwest Institute of Technology. Outstanding students in mathematics and physics who had graduated from high school were recruited to specialize in the research and manufacture of armored vehicle engineering, aiming to manufacture armored vehicles domestically. The course of study was five years, so the level of students at the school was even higher than that of ordinary universities. Since its establishment, it has been through eight years. Its graduates are spread throughout the country, serving the nation and contributing greatly. Now, in order to unify the training of ordnance personnel, the Joint Logistics Headquarters has requested the Ministry of National Defense to merge the college with the Ordnance School of the Ordnance Department. He Xuzuan was appointed as the director, and the name was changed to the Armored Vehicle Engineering Department. Together with the school's original "Armament" and "Applied Chemistry" departments, it forms the College of Ordnance Engineering, becoming the highest institution of national defense science, hiring renowned professors from China to teach. The school address has been moved to Paotaiwan, Wusong, in this city. Mr. He Xuzuan is a graduate of the University of Wisconsin and has written extensively, especially with profound knowledge of thermodynamics.</p>

<p>[Tianjin News] Wang Chongzhi, the general manager of the Kailuan Mining Bureau, saved 500 million yuan from his mother's funeral and donated it to the Nankai University Economic Research Institute, naming it "Wang Mu Fan Tai Madam Memorial Fund" to show his remembrance of the hard work of his mother's education.</p>
<h3>Improving Scientific Education and Cultivating a Spirit of Creativity; Ministry of Education to Coordinate the Manufacturing of Instruments; Science Museums to be Established Universally in Provinces and Cities</h3>
<p>[Nanjing Airmail News] In the past, our country's scientific education in schools has mostly focused on explanation and rote memorization, making it difficult to cultivate the habit of empirical evidence and nurture a spirit of creativity. Public scientific education has received even less attention. Few provinces have established "science museums" in accordance with the Ministry's orders, and most of these are poorly equipped and face financial difficulties, making it difficult to demonstrate results. Therefore, as a result of decades of promoting scientific education, students have very little interest in science, leading to poor academic performance. The public lacks scientific common sense and a scientific spirit, and is still full of superstitious ideas, with no scientific attitude or method in handling affairs and conducting themselves. The Ministry of Education is aware of this and is therefore actively engaged in improving scientific education, having formulated the following measures: (1) Primary and secondary school science education must pay attention to the following matters: 1. Equipment should be enriched to allow children to be immersed in a natural science atmosphere. 2. Encourage children to study independently to stimulate their interest in learning. 3. Improve science teaching materials to suit children's experiences and needs. (2) Provinces and cities that have not yet established science museums should quickly prepare for their establishment within a time limit in accordance with the Ministry's promulgated General Regulations for the Organization of Provincial and Municipal Science Museums. Those that have already been established should raise ample funds and enrich their equipment. The government should allocate foreign exchange to each museum to enrich its equipment, or the Ministry of Education should centrally purchase scientific supplies from abroad and distribute them to each museum for application. (3) People's education centers at all levels should list the promotion of public scientific education as one of their central tasks. (4) "Scientific Experiment Centers" should be universally established in counties and cities for the use of teachers and students of schools at all levels under the jurisdiction of each county and city, as well as for local residents to conduct experiments and research. (5) Coordinate the manufacturing of instruments, specimens, and the compilation and printing of outlines: 1. The Ministry of Education will coordinate, divide the country into several regions based on the distribution of schools, and establish a scientific instrument manufacturing plant in a suitable location in each region to regularly and fully supply the various scientific instruments, specimens, and medicines required by the schools in the region. 2. Instruments and specimens that cannot be manufactured independently, or that cannot be manufactured independently in time due to excessive demand, will be centrally purchased and distributed by the Ministry of Education from abroad based on the actual needs of schools in various provinces and cities across the country. 3. Important books related to scientific education should also be centrally compiled, printed, or translated in large quantities by the Ministry of Education and distributed successively.</p>

<h3>Nine Universities Basketball Tournament: A Wonderful Special Feature: Wisconsin Wins All Five Games</h3>
<p>[Special Translation by This Newspaper] James Naismith, the inventor of basketball, specifically established thirteen rules to prevent this game of judging victory and defeat from causing rough actions, so that basketball players would not have the opportunity for physical contact with each other during the game. However, more than fifty years ago, after the game, there were often incidents of strong players stalking and beating weak players walking home. Now, only eight years after James' death, he would never have imagined what kind of game students from nine universities in the United States would treat basketball as.</p>
<p>Numerous Fouls</p>
<p>In the "Big Nine" basketball tournament in the United States, as of the middle of last month, the Wisconsin team led the pack with five wins in five games. The scene of the team's hard-fought victory over the Iowa team was unusually intense. The players on both sides were called for a total of 47 fouls, and a total of four players were penalized and left the court. By the end of the game, there were still four players on the court, each of whom had been called for four fouls. The game was held in Madison, Wisconsin, with 13,000 spectators, mostly supporting the home team Wisconsin, shouting non-stop, with their emotions floating, adding fuel to the fire, and booing the Iowa team, which was a bit too much to treat the visiting team.</p>
<p>Jeering at the Referee</p>
<p>The Wisconsin team captain, Miles, fought bravely and knocked an opposing player 15 feet away from the court, onto the lap of a spectator in the front row. Miles was therefore penalized and left the court, and the audience hissed and cursed at the referee, and cheered for Miles. Wei Ya of the Iowa team was short in stature and had competed in Madison last winter, leaving an impression on the audience. In those days, Wei often failed to score near the basket and was ridiculed. The audience shouted: "Shoot! Shoot!" Wei persevered and indeed, his time came and he scored 24 points in a row. In the middle of last month, against the Wisconsin team, Wei Ya also scored 20 points, becoming the highest scorer of the entire game. When Wei Ya was fouled out and left the court, he actually won applause from the entire hall. It is rare for a losing visiting team to receive such honor.</p>
<p>Adding Points to the Home Team</p>
<p>Because of the fans' disturbances, it affected the home team's morale. Therefore, American basketball experts, when encountering such a situation, often add six points to the home team on the scoreboard before the game starts. In such an important program as the "Big Nine Competition," at least ten points should be added. Wisconsin's first five games were all held locally, and they won all of them.</p>
<p>The Wisconsin team uses a full-speed "soccer-style" tactic, running, shooting, without stopping or aiming. However, when the Wisconsin team's forward "Dwarf Chicken" Gu Ke—who was the highest scorer in the "Big Nine" last year—occasionally makes a fixed push shot, the other three Wisconsin team members stand around Gu Ke in front of him, forming a tight screen to increase Gu Ke's confidence and accuracy in shooting.</p>
<p>Game Result</p>
<p>The result of that game was that Wisconsin defeated Iowa 60-51. When the final whistle sounded, an Iowa player shook the scoreboard angrily and shouted: "Wait, let us clean you up in Iowa!"</p>
<p>There is no need to wait that long. The wins and losses among strong American basketball teams are often unpredictable. Five days later, the Michigan team went to Madison, and the Wisconsin team lost 39-43, resulting in the team's first loss of the season. (Chang Nian)</p>

<h3>26 Applications Approved Yesterday; Purchasing Finished Products Comes to an End</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] The Four Joint Offices held their last Finished Product Purchase Examination Meeting at 2:00 PM yesterday, and the meeting adjourned at 4:00 PM. As a result, 26 applications were approved, including paper, Western medicine, cotton textiles, motors, lathes, and other industries, with a total approved purchase amount of approximately 20 billion yuan. At this point, the examination of finished product purchases before the Lunar New Year has come to an end.

<h3>Ministry of Agriculture Plans to Achieve Food Self-Sufficiency; Increased Production Zones Established in Eleven Provinces</h3>
<p>The government is determined to increase food production in order to achieve self-sufficiency. This year, the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry has formulated an increased production plan. According to Tan, the director of the Agricultural Extension Committee of the Ministry, this year a focus principle will be adopted, setting up increased production zones in grain-producing provinces. It has been decided to set up two to three increased production zones in eleven grain-producing provinces, including Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, Hunan, Hubei, Jiangxi, Guangdong, Guangxi, Henan, Sichuan, and Fujian. Each increased production zone will designate several counties with the most abundant grain production as food increased production areas. In this area, water conservancy, seeds, and fertilizers must be matched with morning loan policies. The manpower and material resources in this area will be completely concentrated for use. Last year, the Ministry sent personnel to various provinces to conduct on-site investigations, and reports are being compiled. The implementation measures will be determined soon. The Executive Yuan allocated 20 billion yuan last year to prepare for the purchase of rice and wheat seeds, as well as medicines and machinery. This year, it will start with rice, and in the second half of the year, it will focus on wheat and miscellaneous grains. The increased production target for rice this year is 8 million shi. In the past, the management was widespread, but manpower and material resources were easily dispersed, and the results were not significant. Therefore, a focus principle has been adopted, and it must be ensured that the predetermined results are achieved within the deputy-fixed increased production zone.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Finance Issues Circular to Central Bank to Verify Names of Organizational Deposit Accounts</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Finance recently issued a circular to the Central Bank, instructing its branches to check organizations and ensure that the true names of the depositors be verified, to prevent abuses. The original letter stated that "According to the reports of various branches of your bank on the inspection of bank operations, the names of the depositors of various organizations are often listed as 'Collection Association,' 'Military Price Difference,' 'Converted Levy Special Account,' 'Operating Expenses,' 'Minnan Taiwan Office,' 'Minzhe Office,' 'Special Tax Funds,' etc., often without the name of the organization, or abbreviated and not detailed, making it difficult to guess and impossible to investigate and correct. In the future, please inform various branch inspection agencies that for this type of organization deposit account names, the true name of the depositing organization must be verified for handling. Appropriate delivery, I hope you check."</p>
<h3>China Farmers Bank Decides to Grant Loans to Cultivate Paper Production in Eastern Jiangxi</h3>
<p>According to this newspaper's Nanchang airmail news, the heavy paper produced in Ruijin and Shicheng in eastern Jiangxi enjoyed considerable production and sales during the war due to the difficulty of importing paper. Now that the import of foreign paper is hindered by the shortage of foreign exchange, the printing industry still feels the severity of the paper shortage. In order to assist the handicraft paper production in Jiangxi Province and solve the paper shortage problem, the China Farmers Bank has decided to provide a large amount of production loans in the art paper production area. The head office has sent an expert to Jiangxi for investigation, and has contacted the Commercial Press and Zhonghua Bookstore in Shanghai to use Jiangxi paper to print books. The bureaus also believe that if Jiangxi-produced paper can be improved in accordance with the size of newsprint and improve the nature of paper production, they are also happy to adopt it. The paper industry loan organized by the Agricultural Bank has decided to directly lend to tank households, collect pulp and purchase paper at market prices, and has ordered paper mold bamboo curtains in Nanxiong to lend to tank households. Once the bamboo curtains are made, the loan procedures will begin.</p>
<h3>Britain Reduces Price Limit, Difficulty in Exporting Frozen Eggs</h3>
<p>Before the war, the export figure of frozen eggs in our country was about 40,000 tons per year. After the war, exports have sharply decreased. The reason is that the main target, Britain, does not have abundant foreign exchange, and our country's costs have increased sharply. Last year, in order to encourage exports and strive for international market position, the government, through the Export Promotion Office of the Transportation Management Committee, entrusted the China Trust Bureau to purchase a large number of frozen eggs from Maochang Company and transport them to the UK. A total of seven batches were loaded, reaching 3,920 tons. At the beginning of the event, the raw materials in our country were only 1.6 million yuan per market burden, and then gradually rose, breaking through 2 million yuan. Therefore, the first batch of 200 tons cost 48.9 million yuan per ton, the second batch of 100 tons cost 56.775 million yuan per ton, the third batch of 200 tons cost 59.4 million yuan per ton, and the fourth batch of 100 tons cost 62 million yuan per ton. At that time, the selling price in the UK was 200 pounds per ton for 3,110 tons, and the rest was sold for 210 pounds per ton, which was equivalent to a loss of about 250% to 300% per ton in national currency, all of which were subsidized by the government. Later, due to the continuous rise in raw materials, and because Britain based on past spring ice egg price practices, the price limit was reduced from 210 pounds per ton to 200 pounds per ton. It is reported that the current chicken eggs are 3.6 million yuan per market burden, and the actual cost per ton, including labor and electricity, is about 320 pounds. If the government adopts a subsidy policy again, the burden will be too heavy. However, according to industry experts, the price of chicken eggs this spring is lower than the general price level, and according to the ratio, the future price increase will not be fierce. It is estimated that the total output to the UK this year can reach about 7,000 tons. In order to earn foreign exchange, promote exports and maintain the position of our mouse frozen eggs in the international market, the government should comprehensively calculate iron, and not be fussy about the amount of subsidies. In addition, the high cost is not just a raw material, such as the cost of living index, water and electricity, transportation, etc., should be included. Furthermore, the total amount of exports throughout the year and the total amount of foreign exchange obtained should be re-examined and considered their gains and losses to weigh the importance. However, what can be considered is the future stability of the pound sterling.</p>
<h3>Domestic Sulfuric Acid Reaches 150,000 Tons Annually</h3>
<p>According to the survey by the Industrial and Commercial Guidance Office, there are about 30 sulfuric acid manufacturing plants in China, spread across Shanghai, Tianjin, Chongqing, Guiyang, Kunming, Lanzhou, Taiyuan, Guangzhou, Shenyang, Taiwan, and other places, and the market is currently flooded with imported sulfuric acid. According to the manufacturing capacity of domestic sulfuric acid machines, the total annual output can reach 150,000 tons, which is sufficient to meet domestic needs and has surplus. In order to make the industry prosper, imports of foreign goods should be prohibited. The office has now drafted the following plan to guide the industry this year: (1) Change the sulfuric acid import quota to import sulfur, which can save foreign countries and solve the raw material problem. Because one ton of sulfur can make three tons of sulfuric acid. (2) Encourage the establishment of factories using contact method machines to improve quality. (3) Assist the sulfurization factory to increase the production of sulfur to achieve the purpose of self-sufficient raw materials. The planned effect is to establish a factory that can produce 50,000 acid-resistant cans per month and a refining factory that can produce 1,000 tons of sulfur per month within one year, and stipulate the import volume of imported raw materials. The office believes that sulfuric acid production is closely related to national defense, agriculture, and industry, and has decided to present it to the Ministry of Economic Affairs for support in order to save important industries.</p>
<h3>Resources Commission to Set Up Iron Smelting Plant on Hainan Island</h3>
<p>The iron ore produced on Hainan Island is one of our country's special products. The output is extremely abundant. In addition to being used for barter trade with Japan, there is still a lot of surplus. Unfortunately, due to the underdeveloped industry in our country, it cannot be fully utilized. In response to requests from all parties, the Real Source Committee will specifically set up an iron smelting plant on the island to use the surplus iron ore to smelt iron. The association is actively preparing, and the capital will be borne by the association alone in order to create the healthiest iron and steel plant.</p>

<h3>Science as the Foundation of National Construction</h3>
<p>— Liu Xian</p>
<p>—Speech broadcast on Yamei Radio at the invitation of the Shanghai Municipal Education Bureau—</p>
<p>I think everyone must have a considerable understanding of "science," because our daily life is closely related to science everywhere. But what exactly is science? I am afraid that some people still do not understand it very well, and there is a need for explanation. Simply put, science is a large branch of knowledge that is systematic, organized, and can be experimented with. Science seeks truth from facts and does not engage in empty talk. In the last three hundred years, science has progressed the fastest, with outstanding achievements that cannot be compared to philosophy and literature. We have used scientific discoveries and inventions to expand our knowledge, increase our enjoyment of life, so some people believe that science is the cornerstone of modern civilization and the source of human wisdom. It has been developed to its current stage and is truly a miracle in the process of human thought development.</p>
<p>Since two atomic bombs took effect in Hiroshima and Nagasaki, they ended World War II ahead of schedule, saving countless lives, and the power of science was thus displayed to the extreme. Until now, all international political, diplomatic, economic, and military trends have been affected by the atomic bomb to some extent. There is no doubt that it is now the world of science and has entered the era of atomic energy.</p>
<p>Science is not only the nanny of modern material civilization, but also the foundation of national construction. Didn't we shout the slogan of "Resistance War and National Construction" during the Anti-Japanese War? This is the unanimous request of the whole country. Now that the Anti-Japanese War has been over for more than two years, logically, we should have embarked on the road to national construction long ago, but because of the many troubles in the country, the great cause of national construction has never started to move forward, and a good opportunity has been missed due to following old ways. This is such a pity! We have gone through eight years of the Anti-Japanese War, and the country's vitality has been greatly damaged, and the people are suffering deeply. Improving people's livelihoods and cultivating national strength are really matters of urgency. In addition, the world situation after the war is turbulent and unstable, the wheels of the times are constantly moving forward, and the great powers are all making plans for national defense security and striving for post-war economic recovery. If we do not seize the opportunity to engage in national construction to meet the urgent needs, not to mention that the fruits of this victory will be difficult to protect, if a third world war breaks out, then our national defense security and national destiny will be unimaginable. Therefore, based on these two reasons, the rise and fall of our country and the prosperity and decline of our nation depend on whether we can build the country from destruction. This task is arduous, the responsibility is great, and the road is long, so everyone must work together.</p>
<p>In order to seek national security and to fight for national survival, we believe that the progress of national construction is of importance to the times. We should have a long-term vision, we must have ideals for national construction, we must consult extensively and visit widely, and we must have plans for national construction. This is to seek happiness for compatriots across the country, and at the same time to lay the foundation for future generations.</p>
<p>The so-called ideal of national construction is to say that we should build this fragmented country of ours into a rich, strong, healthy, and happy country. We should examine the national conditions internally, observe the general trend externally, conform to the trend of the world, modernize this old civilized country of ours, educate the many ignorant and uneducated people, and revive the morals that are about to be lost. In short, we should use the collective wisdom and effort to build our lovely motherland, which is large, rich in resources, and populous, into an independent, free, peaceful, and democratic country. This is our ideal, this is our vision.</p>
<p>However, the great cause of national construction is complex and cannot be achieved overnight. We need meticulous plans. With perfect plans, we can then implement them step by step, build them in stages, train talents, and raise funds. Like the Soviet Union's implementation of several five-year plans, it has received great results in national construction, and is now implementing the first new five-year plan after the war, which can serve as our model. Therefore, we should use meticulous and accurate methods, enlarge our vision, formulate plans, implement them in stages, build them in different places, expedite what is urgent, and postpone what can be postponed. If five-year plans are not enough, make ten-year plans, and if ten-year plans are not enough, prepare for twenty-year plans. In the end, we will definitely be able to achieve the goal of national construction. We are citizens of the Republic of China, we must have self-confidence, we are descendants of the Yellow Emperor, we must have a grand spirit. Qin Shihuang built the Great Wall, and Emperor Yang of Sui opened the Grand Canal, both of which established great achievements in human history. Is it possible that we, living in the twentieth century today, having received scientific education, cannot follow in the footsteps of our ancestors and build our country successfully?</p>
<p>Now we are standing from a scientific point of view, thinking that no matter how lofty our ideals for national construction are, how beautiful our plans are, how firm our confidence is, and how grand our spirit is, if we want to achieve our ideals, realize our plans, strengthen our beliefs, and exert our spirit, we cannot but pay attention to a potential factor, and that is the application of science. In other words, science is the foundation of our national construction. Without science as a foundation, national construction cannot be started. Without science, there is no national defense, and without science, there is no talk of improving people's livelihoods. It can even be said that a person without scientific knowledge is not worthy of being a modern person, and a country without scientific culture cannot be called a modern country.</p>
<p>Recently, the National Economic Commission drafted a set of economic reform programs, the content of which is divided into industry, agriculture, mining, water conservancy, transportation, finance, and finance, which is quite detailed. If it can be fully implemented and completed within the time limit, it can be regarded as part of the work of national construction. However, the scientific knowledge and technical talents required are not few. For example, the various departments of industry, water conservancy, and transportation are nothing but the application of mathematics, physics, and chemistry, agriculture is based on biology, and mining is based on geology, chemistry, and so on. Therefore, if we want to promote the application of science, we must first pay attention to the research of pure science. If the foundation of pure science is well laid, application is very easy. In other words, if our scientific research has made achievements, economic reform will also be easier. Water has a source, and the Tai has a root. The foundation of our national construction is based on science.</p>
<p>Finally, I would like to take this opportunity to arouse the attention of the government authorities, social sages, and scientific circles, that is, the great cause of national construction is underway, and there is no room for mistakes, so it should meet the needs of the times, so it should protect the country's position, and even more so it should seek national unity; there must be perfect plans, there must be a scientific foundation, more funds should be raised, talents should be recruited widely, priorities should be distinguished, and construction should be carried out at any time and in any place. The government presides over the overall plan, the social figures provide assistance from the sidelines, and scientists work hard to engage in it. The three parties work together, bury their heads in hard work, and take twenty years as the time limit. I believe that our great cause of national construction will be successfully completed. The country will benefit and the nation will be blessed! (February 6)</p>
<h3>Calcium Carbide</h3>
<p>— Bao Zhongqi</p>
<p>The Mother of the Chemical Industry</p>
<p>When you are walking on the road at night, don't you see bright lights burning at the fruit stands on both sides of the sidewalk? This is what we know as a calcium carbide lamp.</p>
<p>The principle of a calcium carbide lamp is very simple: just add water to calcium carbide, and it produces a flammable gas, commonly known as calcium carbide gas, which ignites upon contact with fire.</p>
<p>In fact, to explain this phenomenon scientifically, the scientific name of calcium carbide is calcium carbide CaF2. It reacts with water to produce acetylene C2H2. Isn't this principle very simple?</p>
<p>Don't underestimate this gas, acetylene, with its foul phosphine odor. Its uses encompass every aspect of the chemical industry and can be considered the foundation of China's future chemical endeavors.</p>
<p>Here, let's analyze and introduce its uses:</p>
<p>In the workshops of repair shops or ironmongers, don't we often see workers using a dazzling flame to do welding work? This is an oxy-acetylene torch, which combines acetylene and oxygen.</p>
<p>However, the most important use of acetylene is not in these areas. It can act like an intermediate product, producing countless important compounds. For example, three molecules of acetylene can polymerize to form benzene (Benzene). Benzene is the starting point for aromatic compounds in organic chemistry. Medicines, dyes, and explosives all start from benzene. The reason why the chemical industry is so developed abroad is entirely due to the extraction of large quantities of benzene from coal tar. Of course, this task is not easy to accomplish in China. Therefore, if China wants to develop various chemical industries in the future, the source of benzene, apart from imported goods, will have to rely on the polymerization of acetylene.</p>
<p>The uses of acetylene are not limited to these. It is also the starting point for aliphatic compounds in organic chemistry. Alcohol, gasoline, and soap can all be made from it.</p>
<p>Acetylene, or rather calcium carbide, is simply the nucleus of the chemical industry. Its research can be said to include a part of chemistry in the scientific plan. Chemists already have a beautiful vision for it.</p>
<p>The problem lies in China's lack of the only driving force! Hydropower. As long as the YVA's hydropower generation plan can proceed as ideal, who can say that China's chemical industry has no future!</p>
<h3>Printed Radio</h3>
<p>— Ni Shangda</p>
<p>The vacuum tube is the heart of a radio; resistors, coils, and capacitors are the skeleton of a radio. Given the current manufacturing and design of these four components, the smallest radio that can be assembled still needs to be about ten cubic inches in size. Recently, some forward-thinking radio engineers in the United States have considered using chemically specialized liquids, such as ink or oil-based paint, for resistors, coils, and capacitors, printing or spraying them onto insulating sheets to make a radio that is a lightweight, portable, flat body. This way, mass production can be achieved using printing methods, reducing costs and eliminating the time-consuming work of repairing radios. Generally, those engaged in the radio industry know that repairing machines is the most complicated and time-consuming work, resulting in the greatest monetary expenditure. With printed radios, everything would be standardized. If a machine breaks down, one could simply discard the old one and buy a new one, only paying a very low price. Repairing old machines would no longer be necessary, saving time and labor, as is obvious. Furthermore, the radio manufacturing industry would undergo a complete transformation. When we first heard this, we were amazed and wondered how it could become a reality. In fact, the grid resistors currently used can be drawn on insulating paper with a pencil or ink, creating stripes with a high resistance of several teraohms. Extrapolating from this, using solutions of various organic or inorganic compounds, it is not difficult to create stripes with smaller resistance to serve as generally applicable resistors. Coils already exist in the form of flat spider webs. Instead of using wire, a conductive liquid could be printed on an insulating sheet to create inductors with appropriate inductance. The manufacture of capacitors has already achieved the ability to spray metal powder onto insulating paper. Thus, the miniaturization of capacitors is also not a problem. Vacuum tubes already have peanut tubes and acorn tubes, which are very small, almost the size of fruit kernels.</p>
<p>Recently, there has also been the so-called microtube, which is slightly larger than a grain of rice, and has been designed and manufactured by the U.S. National Bureau of Standards for use in military radios. Although the details have not been released, the miniaturization of vacuum tubes has already transitioned from an ideal to a reality. The magnetic alloy "Alinco" is small in size but has strong magnetism, allowing it to be used to manufacture small speakers, as well as very small generators to serve as radio power sources. From this perspective, considering the current products and future trends, coupled with the industrial equipment and engineering talent in the United States, printed radios will surely be available for sale in the market with a few years of effort. Ideals are the mother of reality. If, forty years ago, when the first spark-gap radio transmitter was being built in England, someone had talked about today's television or radar, everyone would have dismissed it as a fool's dream. The way we see the past is no different from the way those in the future will see the present. Let us regard today's printed radios as the radar of forty years ago and wait and see.</p>
<h3>The Smallest Microscope</h3>
<p>— Hong En</p>
<p>Microscopes no larger than a pencil are now available for use by scientists. The eyepiece can be rotated to determine the focus, and one end of the objective lens is cut with an oblique block to provide light. It is simple and convenient, and with a magnification of 25x, it is sufficient to observe tiny, powder-like substances.</p>
<h3>Scientific Gleanings</h3>
<p>— Xie Zhangtao</p>
<p>Planting Grass by Air - To prevent rainwater from eroding the surface soil and silting up river channels, the United States has recently used airplanes to spread weed seeds. After they grow, they can prevent surface soil erosion. One airplane can sow seeds over an area of 20,000 acres in one day. 10,000 acres requires 240 tons of seeds, and the seeding cost per acre is $2.03, of which seeds account for $0.28.</p>
<p>Giant Iron Vehicle - The earth-moving machine, weighing 1,100 tons, which was assembled in three months using parts transported by 45 trucks at a coal mine in Indiana, USA, has begun to work. This machine can excavate 35,000 cubic yards of soil per day, which is equivalent to excavating the foundation of 200 houses. Its digging shovel is so large that a large truck can drive into it with room to spare. This "giant hand" can fill an entire freight train car with only two digs. It uses 1,800 horsepower as power and only requires three people to manage.</p>
<p>Water Bombs Save Forests - Every year, forest fires cause the United States to lose 31 million acres of forest. Therefore, the United States is now using new and effective airplanes carrying fire-extinguishing bombs filled with water or chemicals to drop and rescue the forests. Each B-29 aircraft can carry eight 165-gallon water bombs, which are dropped close to the flames and automatically dissolve into a rain screen that descends.</p>
<h3>Sex Determination of Single Female Reproductive Offspring (Continued)</h3>
<p>— Xie Yeying</p>
<p>We know that the maturation of ordinary bisexual reproductive cells must undergo a reduction division, the result of reduction division is that only half of the original number of chromosomes remains in the egg and sperm cells. That is, in spermatogonia and oogonia, the chromosomes are diploid (2n), and when they divide into mature sperm and eggs, the number of chromosomes is reduced by half, leaving only haploid (n) chromosomes. These eggs and sperm with haploid chromosomes, if combined and fertilized, the chromosomes in the fertilized egg will return to the original diploid state.</p>
<p>Eggs that undergo single female reproduction, one type undergoes reduction division, so the mature egg only has a haploid set of chromosomes. One type does not undergo reduction division and still retains a diploid set of chromosomes. Whether the egg undergoes reduction division or not is the key to whether the chromosomes are haploid or diploid; and whether the number of chromosomes is haploid or diploid directly affects the sex determination of the offspring. Therefore, from a cytological and genetic point of view, single female reproduction can be divided into three categories: haploid chromosome single female reproduction, diploid chromosome single female reproduction, and alternating haploid and diploid chromosome single female reproduction.</p>
<p>(A) Haploid parthenogenesis:</p>
<p>Like ticks, bees, ants, wasps, etc., the eggs of single female reproduction normally undergo reduction division before maturation. The offspring developed from this type of egg with half the number of chromosomes are mostly male. So it may as well be said that haploid parthenogenesis is probably male offspring parthenogenesis. For example, in (1) Tetranychus binocnlatus in the tick family, according to Schrader's research in 1923, the unfertilized eggs of females develop independently and can only become male offspring. He examined that there are six chromosomes (diploid) in the oogonia, and only three chromosomes (haploid) in the mature egg. This proves that the reason why the offspring produced by such single female reproduction are male is because the chromosomes are haploid. If the eggs produced by the female are combined with sperm for fertilization, the offspring developed from the fertilized eggs are mostly female. Because the diploid (six) chromosomes are restored in the fertilized egg cells. What seems difficult to understand is that since the male offspring of this type of single female reproduction only have a haploid (three) set of chromosomes, do their spermatogonia in the future need to undergo reduction division again when they divide and mature into sperm? If they undergo reduction division again, won't the number of chromosomes decrease generation by generation, becoming less and less? The fact has proven that the sperm produced by this type of male offspring does not undergo reduction division during its maturation process. While the maturation process of female eggs always undergoes reduction. Therefore, haploid parthenogenesis can only produce male bodies, while the offspring evolved from fertilized eggs are often female bodies. Furthermore, we can examine the reproductive situation of bees: (2) In the bee group, there are three types: drones, queens, and worker bees. Both queens and worker bees are female (but worker bees are infertile females, unless the queen in the group dies suddenly, they can turn into fertile females and produce eggs that develop into drones). The chromosomes in the nuclei of all queen bee cells are 32 (2n), and the chromosomes in the nuclei of all drone bee cells are 16 (n). When the oogonia of the queen bee undergo mature division, they must undergo reduction division. Therefore, only 16 chromosomes remain in all mature eggs, and the offspring evolved from such eggs with haploid chromosomes are always male. While the offspring evolved after sperm and egg combine for fertilization are often female. The most detailed research on bee reproduction is by Meves and Nachtschein. From 1901 to 1907, Meves studied the sperm development of bees and wasps (Vsepa). He not only saw 16 chromosomes in spermatogonia, but also proved that sperm also had the same 16 chromosomes. In 1913, Nachtschein proved that queens and worker bees both have diploid chromosomes, with a number of 32, while drones only have haploid chromosomes, with a number of 16. When drone sperm undergoes mature division, there is a movement close to reduction division in the primary spermatocytes, but it does not actually reduce the number, and only a polar body without a nucleus is expelled, so the sperm still retains 16 chromosomes.</p>
<p>The above two examples not only illustrate the reason why haploid parthenogenesis evolves into male offspring, but also explain why the offspring evolved from these animals during bisexual mating reproduction are often female. (Zhu Wan)</p>

<h3>Fool's New Year</h3>
<p>— Bai Yong</p>
<p>Shanghai slang: "Wang Xiaoer's New Year, each year is worse than the last." My hometown has a saying: "A fool's New Year—looking at the neighbors." Neighbors mean the people in the neighborhood. Even a fool knows about the New Year, right? The original meaning is just to say that everything can be imitated from the wise. But today, the New Year only has the path of looking at the neighbors, and we writers who sell our words to make a living can hardly talk about the word "New Year."</p>
<p>The east neighbor makes a living by slaughtering cattle. He was originally very poor. Since the autumn, he has transported beef from other ports and sold it in this port at high prices, making several times the profit. He has gradually changed his appearance, from bowing his head and frowning to raising his eyebrows and exhaling. Recently, he transported batches of water buffalo from the countryside, sold them, and then took back the price of the cattle. As a result, he made more money and lived a better life. His daughter bought a new coat, his wife bought a new ring, his young master called himself a "young master," and his father was of course the boss. His arrogant appearance made the poor scholars feel intimidated. Moreover, the checks and bank drafts from his own shop were waved around, and tens of millions of gold coins came in and out with a stroke of a pen, which was truly shocking. However, in the past few days, the situation has suddenly changed. The villagers came to demand the price of the cattle, and the courtyard was full of curses, and the sound of weeping filled the ears. The boss was sighing, and the young master was avoiding him. Outsiders were puzzled, but it seemed that they could roughly understand that he had sold the cattle for money and spent it himself. Now that he has no way to pay, he has to tear down other people's walls.</p>
<p>The west neighbor runs a coal shop. He used to be a fellow in a coal shop. When the Japanese came, the boss ran away, and he took over the shop. He actually managed it well. Last year, he earned tens of millions. This year, he can of course count in hundreds of millions. Although he is illiterate, he is not stingy in betting millions when playing mahjong. His son no longer studies the useless middle school, but manages the accounts in the shop. When he meets people, he always says: "What's the use of studying? It's better to do business."</p>
<p>The south neighbor is a senior official of a certain high-level administrative agency. He lives in a dormitory allocated by the government, with a wife and two children, but he hasn't even prepared cotton clothes properly. The sixty-year-old man borrows money outside every day. If it weren't for the flour allocated by the government, eating would have become a problem long ago. Now, let's not talk about the New Year. The tuition fees for the two children alone cost 10 million, enough to make him frown for a month.</p>
<p>Pickled fish and cured meat are hung on other people's windowsills. Today, he buys firewood. Tomorrow, he buys rice. He eats New Year's Eve dinner and pastes Spring Festival couplets. The children have a new set of clothes today and a new hat tomorrow. Firecrackers are set off with a bang, and the gongs and drums are beating.</p>
<p>Can you not be threatened by the New Year? Can you say, "The world is in chaos and the people are poor, what New Year are we celebrating?" It is we who are poor. What does it have to do with others? If a fool doesn't look at the neighbors, at least he won't know that it's the New Year. If he sees others celebrating the New Year, but he has no New Year to celebrate himself, that's a big problem. In the meaning of the proverb, it is said that the fool has not tried to celebrate the New Year, but just doesn't know how to celebrate it. Now, it is knowing but not being able to do it, and it is not that he can't do it himself, but that "firewood, rice, oil, salt, sauce, vinegar, and tea are all in other people's homes." If you are not a fool, you have to pretend to be a fool. If you are not foolish, you have to pretend to be foolish. The last two sentences of the previous poem say, "I can't be sad at all, and I will cultivate the bright moon and plant plum blossoms." Perhaps only saints can cultivate this, or else they are complete and authentic Ah Qs. We ordinary people are forced to be under the "strong yoke," and we can't help but feel our own insignificance and danger. In this urgent scene of the end of the year, we really feel the intrusion of our complaints and sorrows.</p>
<h3>On Severe Punishment</h3>
<p>— Ren Weiyin</p>
<p>There have been many events in recent days, and the source of the chaos has not been eliminated. Many people naturally talk about the issue of "using severe punishment," and they gnash their teeth, wishing they could immediately come up with some method to clarify this chaotic situation.</p>
<p>The idea of "governing a chaotic world with severe punishment" comes from the Book of Lord Shang. Shang Yang and Han Fei believed that human nature was moving in an increasingly bad direction, and to cure the prevalent disease of "taking advantage of opportunities for profit," it was necessary to use severe punishments, but not to make severe punishment the sole purpose. Han Fei said: "A wise ruler establishes rewards that can be obtained and sets up laws that can be avoided, so virtuous people are encouraged to seek rewards, and unworthy people rarely receive punishment." He also said: "The wise ruler's rewards are like timely rain, and the people benefit from its dew; his punishments are like thunder, and even the gods cannot change them. If there is indeed merit, then difficult and distant people must be rewarded; if there is something wrong, then even close relatives must be punished." Han! At that time, the abbreviation of "democracy" was still a question mark, but he said that rewards are like timely rain, making the people clear about their benefits, and the law is like thunder, which even the gods cannot change. This is the modern spirit of law. His thoughts originally came from Lao Tzu. Lao Tzu talked about politics and advocated "doing things in the beginning, and starting from the beginning of the chaos." Therefore, he said: "Those who use soldiers are not known for their great achievements." There is no need to seek remedies after the fact, but should be dredged in advance. Wang Bi annotated Lao Tzu, saying that he "acts in accordance with nature, does not create or start." Since he can prevent problems before they occur, why should he be anxious afterwards? Therefore, Lao Tzu said: "Kindness can conquer, simplicity can broaden, and not failing is the first in the world, so it can become a vessel for growth." It is really a treasure book for governing the family for thousands of generations.</p>
<p>In Lao Tzu's era, the world did not seem to be so chaotic. The moral standards at that time were still at the stage of "loyalty, trustworthiness, benevolence, and righteousness." Lao Tzu said, "Ritual is a thinness of loyalty and trustworthiness, and the beginning of chaos." Later, even "ritual" could not play a role in society, so they talked about "punishment" and "military expeditions." Han Fei advocated talking about "avoidable" punishments and implementing "achievable" rewards, the purpose of which was still to save the world and to save human nature. The "severe punishment" used to govern a chaotic world is not to take pleasure in "punishment" for a while.</p>
<p>Now, the successive "chaos" inevitably makes some people feel that the authorities are too lenient, and the call for "using severe punishment" is also becoming more and more vocal. But if we think carefully, is "overly lenient governance" also a "source of chaos"? And have fundamental considerations been made in advance for certain practical livelihood issues of the people? Therefore, although we fully support the saying of "governing a chaotic world with severe punishment," this is conditional, "something to do, something not to do." After all, "soldiers" are "inauspicious weapons," not "gentlemen's weapons." They must be used as a last resort, and "tranquility should be the main thing."</p>
<p>The conclusion still uses Lao Tzu's saying: "Kindness can win in war," and then quotes Zhuge Liang's saying that "the law should be enforced and gratitude should be known," so as to avoid provoking greater resentment.</p>

<h3>Before Dinner</h3>
<p>— Ji Mo</p>
<p>Before dinner every day, I always make a small vow to myself: I must eat half a bowl of rice less tonight. Because, based on past experience, if I eat too much, as soon as I put down my rice bowl, I often fall asleep, regardless of my wife's advice, and don't want to do anything. And the time indicated by the clock on the table is often only seven o'clock and a quarter.</p>
<p>According to the customs of society, these days are the end of the lunar year. Not only do shops have to be busy closing accounts, but also personal matters seem to need to be finished so that they can prepare for the "year's plan in spring" for the coming year.</p>
<p>I am not very busy, but there are many trivial matters that have not been sorted out, and it seems that most of them are literary debts. For example, the "Introduction to ×× Learning" specially commissioned by a certain bookstore has not yet been submitted, and the short essay requested by the ×× magazine has not yet been written. I am even afraid to go to the ×× magazine to chat with the editor, lest he ask me for the "debt" in person. In addition, I must finish revising an essay entrusted to me by a certain gentleman within the lunar year.</p>
<p>Therefore, I really have to implement the small vow mentioned at the beginning of this article. If I don't let my stomach be too full, I can always drive away the feeling of fatigue and start a night car.</p>
<p>Naturally, another way to force yourself to work is to delay the time for dinner. Before dinner, read more reference books or write more sections of text. Today I adopted this new doctrine. When I got home, I lay on the sofa and was about to pull out that thick "Statistical Methods" written by Professor Mills from the bookshelf, but after a day of work, I couldn't help but steal a moment of leisure and unconsciously pulled out a memoir of interviews written by a reporter from the American World Telegraph, Mr. Smith, to read.</p>
<p>This book records many sporadic stories, mostly about the film city. For example, he went to Hollywood and discovered that the scenery of "Shangri-La," which is known as the paradise in Coleman's "Lost Horizon," was actually a mound overgrown with weeds. Also, when the film "Waterloo Bridge" was being staged in a certain place in the United States, it happened that the protagonist of the film, Miss Vivien Leigh, also came to the theater to visit. In his pen, she is a petite and exquisite woman. At that time, she was nervous and, in order to avoid being surrounded by fans, he volunteered to accompany her out of the side door of the theater. The book also says that some big stars in the film city rarely go to New York once in four or five years, which seems to be a strange thing to people who have never been to the United States.</p>
<p>I read on like this unconsciously. In a flash, my wife was busy preparing dinner for me. It was already 8 o'clock. The neighbors were eating New Year's Eve dinner today and sent us a bowl of braised chicken with chestnuts. My wife also prepared for me the meatloaf steamed egg that I liked to eat. I couldn't help but exceed the amount I originally limited. As a result, I still put my work aside temporarily and fell asleep as soon as I lay down. According to my wife's report the next day, I started snoring less than three minutes after I went to bed.</p>
<h3>Light Snowflakes See Off the Old Year</h3>
<p>— Lei Hong</p>
<p>These past few nights, I've been leaning over my desk by the window, the sounds of New Year's drums on the road have been quite lively. Amidst this hurried fading year, the people's emotions towards the end of the year naturally give rise to a feeling of celebration. The Lunar New Year's deep roots in the hearts of the people can be said to be of long-standing history and very much in accordance with nature.</p>
<p>On New Year's Eve, what's most easily stirred up are childhood memories. The more years one spends away from one's hometown, the more one thinks of the good old days: when we were still carrying embroidered ball lanterns, pulling rabbit lanterns, unknowingly and unconsciously spending a joyous New Year's Eve. Although in the drowsy late night, even though the adults urged us to go to sleep, we still refused, clinging nostalgically to the table, watching our mother carefully wrapping ten copper coins in red envelopes made of plum-red paper, so crisp and neat, wrapping them into envelopes without the slightest wrinkle, in preparation for the needs of the servants on New Year's Day... The sound of gongs and drums of the New Year constantly came from the surroundings, and all the rituals of sealing wells, taking over the household, and burning incense to the heavens, were always held after midnight. We had to wait, a kind of inexplicable waiting, only feeling very excited, and only when the third watch had dripped away, would we slowly go into the room that had been熏ed with rue and was filled with the heavy scent of New Year's Eve to sleep. At this time, the red candles on the candlestick had formed candle flowers in the jumping flames, symbolizing good fortune for the New Year.</p>
<p>This year's Beginning of Spring (立春) is especially early, the solar term for Beginning of Spring arrives on the 25th day of the twelfth lunar month. And on the eve of the Beginning of Spring, there was a whole day of winter snow, flying all over the sky like feathers. Farmers regard winter snow as an auspicious omen, predicting a good harvest for the coming year. Beginning of Spring is the first season in the lunar calendar, and it can also be said to be the New Year's Day of seasons. Therefore, a snowstorm on the eve of the Beginning of Spring perfectly matches the line from Jiannan's poem: "Light snowflakes see off the old year." This is the only New Year's Eve poem collected in Fang Weng's poetry collection, which says:</p>
<p>"A few huts by wild water and maple forest,</p>
<p>A cold stove without fire, sitting without a mat,</p>
<p>The dim lamp shines on a lonely shadow,</p>
<p>Light snowflakes see off the old year,</p>
<p>Pepper wine wards off warmth, poured sparkling,</p>
<p>Blue-robed captives dance lightly;</p>
<p>From now on, offer spring shepherd's purse as a delicacy,</p>
<p>Don't worry, Foolish Old Man, about ten thousand coins a day!" Jiannan Weng's poems are broad and lovely. Like this New Year's Eve poem, it still inevitably has a sense of one's life experience at the beginning, thus especially in the season when the year is about to end, it evokes a feeling of one's own vastness. The poetic realm seems to be very narrow, and what is poured into it is all personal feelings of loneliness. But from the fourth line, "Seeing off the old year", the heart expands, "From now on, offer spring shepherd's purse as a delicacy, Don't worry, Foolish Old Man, about ten thousand coins a day", isn't it another expression of the emotion "If winter comes, can spring be far behind?" Compared to the endless desolation of the New Year's Eve poem at Liangdangxuan: "Standing alone on the city bridge, no one recognizes me, watching a star like the moon for a long time," the former feels more graceful and open-minded. There is much optimism in Fang Weng's poems, such as "Being poor, I don't plan for tomorrow, when the mood comes, I'm young again", such as "After the rain, a thousand layers of evening mountains are green, flowers fall into a stream, the fragrance of spring water", such as "Don't sigh about dust in plain clothes, it's still possible to get home by Qingming",... it's certainly not just this one New Year's Eve poem that is like this.</p>
<p>If it were in today's cities, people are ultimately happy, in every winter, they can spend two joyous festivals, the Western one is Christmas; while the essence of the country is the Lunar New Year. And the latter is closer to the people, almost every household, large and small, will be lively. Even in the most difficult times, they must brush away the coldness in their hearts and anticipate the warmth of the coming spring. Speaking of the most difficult times, I once wrote an essay on the same topic, ending with the hope that the world would return to clamor. Of course, at that time, my mood was very suffocating, even writing articles had to go around in circles, so euphemistic to the point of being indescribable. At that time, the so-called clamor referred to defeating the enemy and achieving victory. Of course, my mood is very different when I write this article tonight, but it seems that the situation of myriad difficulties has turned another page, but we must have hope, just like tonight's New Year's Eve, after passing the old year, there will definitely be a new year coming.</p>
<h3>Russian Humor</h3>
<p>— Fang Ji</p>
<p>Once, a representative from a certain country went to see a Russian official and asked, "May I ask, why is that thing on your desk placed like that?"</p>
<p>The official said, "This is my thing, I can put it wherever I want!"</p>
<p>The representative went to the official residence of another official and saw that the official's chair was hanging from the ceiling, so he politely asked for the details.</p>
<p>The official became angry and said, "This is my chair, I can put it wherever I want!"</p>
<p>Finally, the representative met Stalin and asked him about the two things above. Stalin said, "Don't mind them, they're just idiots."</p>
<p>"Then why do you use these idiots?"</p>
<p>Stalin said angrily, "These are my idiots, I can put them wherever I want, what's it to you?"</p>
<h3>Mourning Teacher Huang Boqiao</h3>
<p>— Qin Shouou</p>
<p>It has been a long time since I have had any emotional surges, but this morning, something like the buzzing of bees pierced my heart.</p>
<p>I personally received the teachings of Teacher Huang Boqiao for three years, and later continued to receive his guidance at the two-route bureau for about four years; in those seven years, there was hardly a day that I did not see his round, white, solemn face, and hear his unique, clear, and firm voice. In the thirty-nine years of my life, the impression he left on me is so profound that there is no one else besides my grandparents and parents. So when I suddenly saw the news of his death in the newspaper, I felt very sad, especially because in the past one or two years, due to my own foolishness and stubbornness—in order to avoid seeing someone I deeply hated, I had not even visited him, and now, no matter what I think of, I can no longer see his face or hear his voice!</p>
<p>Teacher Huang can be said to be a person who truly belongs to the country and society. His concept of the individual self was so faint that it was almost non-existent. He didn't accumulate money, didn't acquire any property, and never felt the slightest bit unhappy about not having any children. Apart from paying attention to maintaining his health for the sake of his work, food and clothing were simply dispensable to him. Many people say that he lacked emotion and was not very willing to help his fellow villagers, classmates, relatives, and friends, and this may not be untrue, because his interest was always unreservedly focused on the cause he was shouldering, and all he cared about was his own work, so of course he had no time to think about other things!</p>
<p>All those who had traveled on the Beijing-Shanghai, Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo railways before the war sincerely admired his achievements, even those who were dissatisfied with him due to personal grudges could not but be impressed. His success was due to nothing other than that he did not have a day, not a thing, that he did not do earnestly and practically. I dare to say presumptuously: if after the victory, the government could have asked Teacher Huang to serve as the President of the Executive Yuan, things in the country would definitely not be as bad as they are today! To say that he was an engineering expert would be to underestimate him!</p>
<p>Teacher Huang suffered from diabetes and heart failure throughout his life. Given his spirit and perseverance, his achievements would definitely not have been limited to what they are now; but now, his life has been taken away at the young age of fifty-five.</p>
<p>In Teacher Huang's will, he strongly advocated not sending funeral wreaths or holding memorial services, which was still his consistent style in life. In order to respect his wishes, I feel that we, his students and old friends, really don't need to send any more flower baskets or wreaths or hold any memorial services. I personally plan to gather former classmates and raise a sum of money for a "Huang Boqiao Memorial Scholarship" as a long-term memorial.</p>
<h3>Reputation</h3>
<p>— Zhimin</p>
<p>Reputation lost in an instant, cannot be restored in a hundred years. (Italian)</p>
<p>Rather damage the body than reputation. (Turkish)</p>
<p>An evil wound can be healed, an evil name cannot be healed. A person who has lost his reputation, though alive, is as good as dead. One without reputation is a walking dead. (Spanish Proverb)</p>
<p>Better to be poor with a good name than rich with dishonor. (Dutch Proverb)</p>
<h3>Carefree Flower</h3>
<p>— Chen Shenyan</p>
<p>Chapter 10 Voluntary Sacrifice (67)</p>
<p>Seeing that Qiwan did not reply, Yuru picked up the cane leaning against the chair and said sadly, "Miss Gu, please forgive me, I have said all I wanted to say, please consider it. I'm leaving!" Saying that, he dragged his trembling steps and walked out step by step. Qiwan watched this situation, her conscience greatly stimulated, and she was very distressed. Seeing Yuru's old and frail state and his hesitant steps, just about to step out of the room, she couldn't help but shout, "Old man, don't go." Yuru turned around and asked, "Is there anything else?" Qiwan said with a crying voice, "Old man, please come back, I have something to tell you." After saying this, she leaned on the table and cried loudly. Yuru turned around, walked closer to her, patted her back with his hand and said, "Good child, I know you are sad. You have a conscience, your love with Zhu is pure, it cannot be broken apart, it's a pity you met too late, this is a lack of perfection in life. You don't need to be sad now, just let it go, anyway, I am an old man of sixty, how many years can I live! You have a great future, don't worry about us old people. I am his mentor, even if he abandons me, I will have no regrets. I am willing to use these short, boring years to wish you eternal happiness!" Qiwan heard this, cried even harder and said, "No! It can't be like this, I will sacrifice myself, I can't destroy Zhu's family, especially you, old man, who has nurtured him for so long, how can I be so selfish, I am although I am infatuated, how can I be unreasonable. I must not let my personal thoughts harm others, I will never marry him!" Qiwan was very sad when she said this, and couldn't help but continue to shed tears. Yuru saw her emotions agitated and heard her say this, and his heart was very moved. He couldn't help but shed a few old tears, wiping the corners of his eyes with a handkerchief, and saying, "I know you are a good child, you are wronging yourself to take care of Zhu, but I don't want you to sacrifice yourself like this." Qiwan said, "No, I can't just consider myself and ruin his whole family, even if Zhu loves me extremely, he is a person with a conscience, as time passes, if he sees you, old man, so sad, he may have regrets one day, then what should I do! I understand now, I love Zhu, but I can't marry him, his circumstances don't allow me to marry him. Thank you for your teachings, old man, I understand everything completely! I can only sacrifice myself now to protect Zhu's whole family, this is how I love Zhu."</p>

<p>Current Official Deeply Addicted to Habits Treats Younger Siblings as Strangers</p>
<p>Chen Wei asks: I have three brothers and one sister. My sister and I were born to my father's second wife. Our family is poor. My eldest brother, with my father's frugal sacrifices, was cultivated until he graduated from university. After my father passed away, the family scattered. My eldest brother was then serving in a central ministry. Due to being addicted to habits, he neglected the livelihood of his stepmother and siblings. I only completed the second year of junior high school and dropped out. Later, my eldest brother introduced me to work in a certain agency. During the Japanese occupation, my mother and sister lived a life no different from begging, but my eldest brother and others did not care. My mother passed away last year due to eight years of hardship and physical weakness. My eldest brother did not take any responsibility for the aftermath. Now, his addiction has not been overcome. Although he is currently a serving official, his behavior is very improper. May I ask: (1) Judging from the above situation, should I have a real responsibility to support him? (2) Can I publish in the newspaper to sever relations with him? If it is not signed by the other party, will it be legally effective?</p>
<p>[Tang Mingshi, legal counsel of this column, replies]</p>
<p>(1) Brothers and sisters have a moral obligation to help each other, but not a legal responsibility. (2) To publish in the newspaper to sever brotherly relations does not require the other party's signature; but the relationship of brothers and relatives is inherent and cannot be severed; what is desired to be severed is economic responsibility only, but since the law is as stated above, whether to sever or not is not a legal issue.</p>
