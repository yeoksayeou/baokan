<h3>文化界動員會　解說戡亂意義</h3>
<p>〔央社南京廿五日電〕中國文化界戡亂救國總動員委員會，爲關明戡亂意義，使國人對戡亂有正確認識，俾知所努力起見，頃發表「我們對戡亂的看法」一文，茲誌如次：</p>
<p>今天的戡亂爲平定共產黨的叛變，指爲「內戰」或「黨爭」皆屬皮相之見。我們要了解戡亂，必須注意他的時代性。</p>
<p>中國經濟落後，停滯於君主專制時代甚久，加以帝國主義侵略，所以非經過一個革命以爭取民族獨立，實行民主政治，改良人民生活不可，而要達到此等目的，則建設統一國家，爲迫切的需要。五十幾年來的國民革命，完全是照這條路子的走。</p>
<p>在這種情形下，只能講三民主義，不能講共產主義。這點就是共產黨也承認，所以談到革命，共產黨自己也以爲現在不能做社會主義革命，只能做民主主義革命。旣是如此，則共產主義之不合於時代需要，就十分明白了。不合於時代需要還來勉强地幹，必然走不通，這除了製造紛亂外，能有甚麼成就嗎？</p>
<p>我們知道共產黨有一成見，以爲中國國民黨不民主，要實行民主就非他莫屬，所以大呌民主主義革命。）這是他有意曲解訓政之所致。其實民主主義革命，完全是中國國民黨所努力的事業，辛亥，討袁，護法，北伐，無一而非民主生義革命之實行。至於召集國民大會，制憲行憲，更使民主主義革命獲得成功。這不僅表明國民黨之爲民主的黨，抑且表明共產黨之大呌民主主義革命爲空泛而不切實際。</p>
<p>共產黨所做的旣非民主主義革命，則其稱兵據地之爲叛亂，一種單純的叛亂，便很明瞭。所謂民主主義革命，不過掩飾其叛亂的烟幕而已。那末平定共產黨叛亂的戰爭，就確是戡亂了。這不僅從法律上形式上說，完全如此，從政治上，實際上說亦完全如此。</p>
<p>戡亂是不是內亂呢？否，共產黨爲國際政黨，有國際背景，其行動是服從國際命令，還聯合了國際軍隊如韓共，日俘等，所以他的叛亂有國際意義。同時共產黨爲新帝國主義侵略中國的工具，正同軍閥爲舊帝國主義侵略中國的工具一樣，他是紅色第五縱隊。這不表明共產黨叛亂是新帝國主義侵略中國的一種方式嗎？因此，戡亂是　又侵略的前哨戰，有救國的意義</p>
<p>然則，戡亂爲革命？很明白，今天的共產黨叛亂，發生於革命時代，即國民革命的前期與後期之間；因此他有破壞前期革命之成功，和阻撓後期革命之進行的作用。戡亂便足以維護前期革命之成功，便利後期革命之進行。這當然是一種革命，從而共產黨叛亂之爲反動，亦很明瞭。</p>
<p>中國共產黨是一種割據，勢力，他稱兵據地達二十年之久，戡亂目的在打破割據，完成統一。統一是由封建到近代的政治運動，可以使國家近代化，因此統一是革命。戡亂旣爲了統一，那也就有革命作用了。</p>
<p>戡亂不僅是爲了統一，還是爲了民主；必須知道，共產黨之大呌民主，完全是一種手段，它並非民主的黨，它的主義是無產階級獨裁。在所謂「解放區」中，實行的是暴力統治，恐怖統治，特務統治，近且公然反對憲法。須知憲法爲民主的條文化和法律化，乃使民主成爲制度的必要方法。今天要實行民主就要擁護憲法。戡亂爲護憲，實在是民主戰爭，即民主與獨裁的戰爭。</p>
<p>戡亂除開民生性質外，還有建國性質。共產黨是一種破壞勢力，專門扒路·毀鑛·掘堤·燬廠·殺人·放火，比日本帝國主義厲害百倍。中國要抵抗新帝國主義的侵略威脅，要改良人民生活，也須努力建設纔行，因此我們有對破壞的必要。所以戡亂是建設與破壞之爭。</p>
<p>以上說明了戡亂與救國·統一。民主。建國的關係，而此四者皆爲國民革命的要求。戡亂在其爲救國戰爭，統一戰爭，民主戰爭，建國戰爭上，實在是一種革命戰爭。這救國，統一，民主，建國，皆爲三民主義的實踐，所以戡亂是爲三民主義　奮鬥的革命戰爭，甚爲重要。因此他是不能詆爲內戰，亦不能認爲黨爭，試問救國，統一，民主，建國，只是黨的事而與人民沒有關係與國家沒有關係嗎？所以，全國人民應該一致動員，出錢出力，踴躍參加。這是現階段的革命工作，中國如要被救住，並建設爲民主統一的三民主義的新中國，只有戡亂。這是中國的出路之新生，應全力以赴從早完成。爲主義，爲革命，爲國家，爲人民，俱要從此做起。</p>

<h3>中美新聞事業的新合作　——本報譯載「赫爾回憶錄」感言</h3>
<p>本報特於本日起逐日列載「赫爾回憶錄」。關於此一回憶錄，共將爲世界第二次大戰的一種重要文獻，無待贅言，但其重要，固不僅在此。世界第二次大戰是人類有史以來爲害最烈的一次浩刦；由於此一戰爭，促使人類有原子能的使用。廣島的一顆炸彈，不僅爲結束此一浩刦的先聲，抑且使人類進入一個新的原子能時代·此其重要，在整個人類的歷史上，實堪與火的最初使用，種植的發明，及蒸汽力的使用相比擬。由於此一戰爭，在人類文化史上劃出了一個新時代。這一新時代所可能給予人類的，究竟是毀滅，抑是繁榮，固尙有待於此後事實的證明，但由於此一戰爭使入類進入一個新的時代，終是無可置辨的了。人類之所以有這一次戰爭，本不由於珍珠港的一擊，波蘭捷克的被侵，和蘆溝橋的「事變」。這些外表的行動還內蘊着更深的衝突。在這些行動的被採取以前，原有着內在衝突的發展：這些行動的被採取，母寗說祗是內在衝突的最高發展。在這一意義下，我們看見有普魯士的兵家以戰爭爲遂行國策的最高手段：所以現代的戰爭是國策衝突累積的結果·第二次世界大戰原有其歷史的背景，而決不是一件偶發事件。第二次世界大戰旣爲人類開展了一個新時代，則如何有此　戰爭的爆發，在人類歷史上實是一個重要的關鍵。這關鍵不全操在掌握兵權的人·却也操在負折衝樽俎之命的外交當局；替人類歷史寫上新頁的，主要恐怕還是這些決定並執行對外國策的人·這其中最重要的一個，無疑的，便是羅斯福總統下的國務卿赫爾。他受命於國家內受經濟恐慌威脅下的艱危之時，外當列强只圖近利孤立無援之會；而終他之任，我們看見有珍珠港的襲擊而掀起了世界第二次大戰。赫爾是一個歷史的人物，他所寫下的，不僅是美国的歷史，抑且是世界的歷史　整個人類的歷史．惟其如此，我們今天能有機會儘先以「赫爾回憶錄」這　新著作逐日譯載出來，與中國萬千的讀者相見，實在感到無上的光榮和欣忭。</p>
<p>我們於此更要指出的，此一回憶錄在本報的刋載，表示中國新聞事業史，乃至中美關係史上的一葉新頁。在我們中國的報紙，原曾儘可能的利用外國新聞社的稿件：但由於新聞事業的不斷發展，繼新聞社供給新聞之外，還有特種新聞稿件供應社的發展；此在美國尤爲發達。在美國，有各種特種新聞稿件供應社的組織，供給全國各地的報紙以論文，專著，及其它特稿：所　「供應特稿」（Symdicated　Features），一人執筆，各報競購版權以刋登，因而可以接觸到數目極衆的讀者。此一發展，在英美固已極著成效·，但在我們中國，　還有待於努力經營。至於與美國特稿新聞稿件供應社發牛關係，在我們中國報紙，當以此次本報的刋載「赫爾回憶錄」爲　創。這不得不說是中國報業史上的一個新紀元。我們願繼此以後，中美兩國的新聞界能有繼續不斷地更緊密的發展。</p>
<p>人民與人民的交住，無疑地，是促進國際了解的要素。這其中的一個主要關鍵，便在其實情報及有益讀物的自由流通。在極權的國家下，旣有嚴厲的新聞封鎖，相互間的深切了解於是幾不可能；或甚至於恃狹隘的民族主義，對國外稿件加以惡意的排斥。凡此均有背於新聞及情報自由流通的原則，違反了民主政治的精神。本報此次之刋載美國編輯入新聞社所供給的「赫爾回憶錄」，在上海取得了各種文字的版權，包括原稿的英文版權在內，不僅表示本報雖爲中國歷史最長的老報，但仍是日求進步歷久彌新的一張報紙，抑且足以表示在我們中國，新聞事業所可能享受到的充分自由，反映中國政府絕對尊重新聞自由，對新聞事業不加絲毫干涉的開明政策。</p>
<p>於此，我們不得不指出一切惡意反對中國政府的傳說，類多爲共匪所製造：共目的是很明顯的·在國外報紙上不時有關於中國政府如何箝制與論及其它惡意中傷的報道，倘不加審察遽予刊載，　爲共匪做了義務宣傳。須知中國政府對於人民的正當自由，從不欲加以限制，觀乎本報的刋載美國編輯人新聞社所供應的稿件，可以得到事實的證明。我們願與美國的同業能有更緊密的結合，俾能克盡我們新聞報道自由的天職，以增進中美間相互的了解。我們說相互的了解，亦望美國的同業能與足以代表中國的報業有更多的接觸，使中國的眞　能够有忠實的報道傳到美國去，使美國入民對於中國的了解，亦能隨之而增進·親仁善鄰，乃至整個世界和平的維繫，感許就該從這些事情做起！</p>

<h3>法政府正式通知英美　決實施法郎貶值　貶值令決延至今日宣布</h3>
<p>〔合衆肚巴黎廿五日電〕法國政府廿五日將法郞貶値之正式布吿延遲廿四小時發表。許受政府前時已宣布將不顧英國之反對及國際貨幣基金暗昧之態度而逕自執行其貶値計劃。然許曼之發言人廿四日晚宣布貶値令將延遲廿四小時再行宣布。</p>
<p>〔路透社巴黎廿四日電〕法財長梅逸宣稱，政府之法郞貶値計劃，可望於星期日下午正式宣布，英法就法郞問題舉行會談之共同公報，同時亦可發表。</p>
<p>〔路透社已黎廿四日電〕法內閣今日通過法案·規定外匯及黃金古塲之管理　則，定星期一交國民議會審査。政府發言人謂，國際貨幣基金會就法國之制度尙未成立決議。政府之法郞貶値計劃，將與國際貨幣基金會之決議同時宣布。</p>
<p>〔路透社華盛頓廿四日電〕國際貨幣基金會董事會今日繼續討論法郞貶値問題。發言人聲明基金會是否能於日內發表正式聲明尙無把握。法國官員則有表示基金會苟不採取法郞貶値之計劃，法國不惜退出該會者。一般預料基金會發表之聲明，將强調法國貶値法郞　暫時性，並表示希希望法國不久能有更正常的匯兌制度，以代替目前將採取之行動</p>
<p>〔合衆社巴黎廿四日電〕據可靠方面訊：法政府今日已通知華盛頓及倫教稱：不顧各方反對，出口法郞將於廿五日晚起貶値。法國堅特此一行動，乃終止法國經濟危機之重要步驟。傳法國已採取此一行動，同時英財相克里浦斯在此間作幾近廿四小時之辯論，勸法國放棄此一計劃後，已登機返英。克氏辯稱，法郞價値作任何之削减，勢必引起英鎊貶値。渠並堅持稱：法郞之貶價將危及英外相貝文廿二日所建議之在英法領導下之新西歐聯盟。法內閣在等候華盛頓國際貨幣基金對法郞決議之意見。但法國對此事之進行顯然業已決定。法國致倫敦及華盛頓之照會中宣稱：出口法郞對美金之匯兌率爲二二五比一。按目前法郞與美元爲一一九比一。據悉：法國幣制穩定計劃中尙有其他兩項綱領，建立巴黎黃金及外幣交易市塲，此將於廿六日提交國民議會。法內閣已准許公開黃金買賣，但曾在若干時間中不能決定法郞貶値，蓋遭英國堅決反對。法內閣在兩小時之緊急會議中尋覓解決經濟混亂之方法。根據新計劃，執有外幣之法人可在法國以公開市塲價格出售外幣。法不管部長亞勃林曾暗示雄議英法間締結一關於貶値問題之折衷協定。倫敦外交界靈通方面稱，即使法郞貶値亦不致引起英鎊貶價。據稱，法方計劃之漏洞甚多，投機者可藉此購買低於官價之英鎊，此「雖妨大局，但將引起吾人之忿怒。」</p>
<h3>法郎貶值計劃實行後　英鎊價值難維持　英人士認爲原計劃漏洞甚多</h3>
<p>〔合衆社倫敦廿五日電〕英國外交部消息靈通人士廿五日稱：法國之法郞貶値計劃將使英國金鎊之現價不易維持，然法國之舉動不致促使金鎊之貶値。接近財政部方面稱：「此事頗爲惱人，然尙非致命之打擊。英國對法國出口法郞貶値及設立自由出口市塲計劃極爲關注，英財政大臣克里浦斯前赴巴黎時，携有財政次長伊第爵士及英格蘭銀行副總裁郭巴德，可見英國對此事之重視。</p>
<p>伊第及郭巴德於去年八月英國決定暫停金鎊自由兌換時曾聯袂赴美。消息靈通方面稱：法國計　將造成更多之漏洞，由此投機　可以低於官價四元三分之價絡　進金鎊。如是則政府益難維持　價，然此尙不足以造成金鎊之貶値。金融泰晤士報稱，法國計　將產生「賭博者之天堂」。</p>
<h3>美政府下令　增加銀行準備金</h3>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓廿四日電〕政府頃通過銀行系統打擎通貨膨脹，此係政府經濟學家對聯邦準備局新條例之簡單解釋。按該新條例，芝加哥及紐約在其控制下之　行須將準備由百分之廿增至百分之廿二，新條例於二月廿七日起實施，此條例曾不及直接管制物價及配給之激烈，然亦足以在之加哥凍結一億美元，在紐約凍　四億二千萬美元，目前此等銀行所需之準備總額，計紐約爲四十三億，芝加哥爲十億，傳大多　銀行界贊成新條例。</p>
<h3>促進歐洲團結謀取世界和科　本年九月將有兩大集會</h3>
<p>〔路透社日內瓦廿五日電〕歐洲於今年九月，將舉行兩大會議，以經由聯邦制度，謀取世界和平。一爲將於九月初在義大利舉行之會議，以設建立世界聯邦政府爲目標。一爲歐洲議會聯盟，將於九月八日在瑞士舉行之會，以討論組織歐洲合衆國爲任務。世界聯邦政府運動之總部，設在日內瓦，已有以建立世界聯邦政府爲目標之二十國五十餘團體參加此一國際機構。關於歐洲合衆國之設立，已由歐洲議會聯盟執委會於去歲十二月在瑞士開會，通過其　型。執委會議決於今年九月八日在瑞士殷特萊根召開大會，起草歐洲合衆國憲法，各歐洲國家議員均得派代表參加。預料參加者將有英法等十三國，據云，希義荷盧四國議會之大多數議員，均憶贊成組織歐洲合衆國。</p>
<h3>烏克蘭建國紀念　蘇外長致辭</h3>
<p>〔路透社倫敦廿四日電〕莫斯科電台稱：莫洛托夫外長於烏克蘭蘇維埃共和國建國卅週年紀念日，親蒞該國最高蘇維埃致辭，略謂，偉大的十月革命，已使全俄羅斯的人民脫離資本主義的奴役，向全世界指示共產主義的路徑，引入自由愉快生活及各民族間友誼的途徑。烏克蘭共和國建國卅年的過程中，充滿經濟文化復興的奮鬥戰爭時期烏克蘭爲德帝國主義的軍隊所佔，烏克蘭之布爾喬亞份子竟有願供其驅使者。蘇聯建國初年，英法之企圖以軍力干涉烏克蘭，亦爲衆所週知之事實。然在蘇聯協助下，烏克蘭之土地卒獲統一，面烏克蘭之人口亦已幾乎等於歐洲任何最大一國之人口。今日吾人在此慶祝烏克蘭建國卅週年紀念，就時間上言，對於烏克蘭及整個蘇聯之人民均有重大意義。</p>
<h3>捷克破獲間諜機關</h3>
<p>〔合衆社普拉格廿五電〕廿五日正式公報稱：平民軍人及婦女共十五人被捕，罪名爲「　某西方强國進行間　活動」。公報稱，此等間諜大抵係蘇　德區日瓦曼人，渠等與遣還德國之家屬及友人保持接觸，渠等被　將關於捷軍及工廠「具有軍事重要性」之情報，供給由某西方强國建立之某日瓦曼人間諜機構。公報稱：該組議係以前秘密警察·納粹黨衛軍·及其他相類之犯罪機關人員爲主者。</p>
<h3>外長代表將開會　　討論奧境德資產</h3>
<p>〔路透社倫敦廿五日電〕四强外長時別代表定週內開會，討論蘇聯就奥境德國資產之建議及法國之折衷建議。英外部發言人謂外長會議秘書處業已接獲最近蘇聯建議案之全文，其中若干點較前已見明朗。</p>
<h3>西歐聯盟計劃積極展開　英爭取外交主動　麥克尼爾表示仍願與蘇修好</h3>
<p>〔路透社倫教廿四日電　〕貝文外相之宣布發動西歐聯盟計劃，以及法國政府之同時發表此一聲明，已打破了倫敦外長會議失敗以後外交上的沉寂。今知在美國顯然的支持下，英法已在西方發動新的政策，自易北河以東的國家手中，奪取了外交主動。就英國方面，，採取新政策後所將實現的行動有如下述：　聯合西歐國家及其海外屬領，發展西歐聯盟；　西德憲政上的改革，可能成立英美法三佔領區之合併，並建立魯爾的國際政權；　英國與阿拉伯國家完成條約網，以確立中東區域的安全制度；　繼續與參加馬歇爾方案諸國合作。</p>
<p>貝文政策的一般性目標，爲在與政冶上同情英國之各國從事合作。</p>
<p>〔路透社竇漢郡蓋次海特廿四日電〕國務部長麥克尼爾在此向工黨會議發表演說，重申英國準談，並使用一切外交程序，試行覓取對蘇聯及東歐更好的關係，討論兩者間的任何問題。此乃吾國之政策，決不背棄之吾人將繼續在聯合國機構中，担任活躍的任務，接受會員國應盡的義務，並隨時願意利用聯合國之各機構。余願重申一遍，吾人決不背棄此一政策。」工黨左翼議員齊利亞克斯即蓋次海特城選區所選出之國會議員，繼起發言，渠云，「邱吉爾曾謂工黨政府業已採用他在美國富爾敦發表的演說，確有其事，邱吉爾的富爾敦演說主張建立英美西方同盟，並以戰爭爲恐嚇對付蘇聯」。竇漢礦工領袖華生當表示參加此會百分之九十之人，均爲政府之堅强後盾。</p>
<p>聯合國注視</p>
<p>〔合衆社成功沛廿四日電〕關於西歐聯盟計劃日益展開一事，聯合國方面廿四晚認爲不　結束「天下一家」式之國際關係觀念。此爲聯合國對貝文號召建立西歐集團，以對抗蘇聯之最尖銳反應。聯合國外交家對於此項計劃應歸罪何方，及西歐集團計劃之最後結果如何，意見甚爲紛亂。但似一致同意聯合國目前已遭嚴重之試鍊，若千方面且對聯合國組織能否生存，亦表懷疑。中國某高級代表係聯合國中最贊成西方列强之人士，亦對西方集團計劃表示與「天下一家」之觀念不相容。聯合國官員現正注視蘇聯及西方然國如何拋棄聯合國憲章，蘇聯抵制聯合國之主要及有關組織，杜魯門主義及馬歇爾計劃之繞過聯合國行動，利用安理會及全體大會以作東西雙方互加壓力之戰術，以及東方集團及西方集團在聯合國組織內之逐漸硬化，據稱使聯合國不能達成其目的。至北歐誌國及亞洲諸國（如印度）似亦將逐于漸加入西方陣營，阿拉伯諸國雖對美國之巴勒斯坦分治計劃極　憤慨，但仍將加入西方陣營。</p>
<p>莫斯科反響</p>
<p>〔聯合社莫斯科廿四日電〕塔斯通訊社廿四日宣稱，英外相貝文提議增强西歐，此乃成立西歐集團之「烟幕」。實際西歐集團業已產生，於同時成立政治，經濟及軍事間盟，此爲確實無梁之事。英國願輿伊朗，伊拉克，外的但及其他阿拉伯國家締結防禦條約，亦可見到東方集團之陰影，不待智者而知。英美兩國欲以條約鋼作鏈，束縛阿拉伯國家，華盛頓輿倫敦方面現正發展一軍事政治聯合方案，企圖以中東全部基地供其武裝軍隊之用。蘇聯始終反抗成立任何西歐集團，認爲於己不利，故其反對貝文計劃，殆將　　對馬歇爾計劃同樣努力。據　綫電台評論員印尼夫斯基稱，貝文爲現　美帝國主義者歐洲計劃之工具，在此眞正任務中，已明白向前開步。當貝文公開卞張之前，美國已有西歐同盟之要求，此非偶然的巧合。貝氏爲資木家之忠僕，對金元及美帝國主義者叩頭，已有最佳之表演矣。</p>
<h3>檢討歐復興計劃　英法義會談結束　荷比盧下月初秘英法接觸</h3>
<p>〔路透社羅馬廿四日電〕英大使館發表公報··宣布英·法·義就馬歇爾方案舉行之談話業已順利結束，會中檢討之主要事項，爲巴黎十六國會議舉行以來，在經濟方面的進展包括歐洲合作，及各參加團本國計劃之實現等。會中並硏究應行採取之步驟以建立繼續　　構，凡願意參加歐洲復興計劃之各國，均可參加該機構。又英法代表團並將赴其他參加馬歇爾方案諸歐洲國之首都訪問。</p>
<p>〔聯合社海牙廿四日電〕荷蘭外交部今日宣布，英法兩國政府代表團定於二月三日在此與比利時·荷蘭。盧森堡關稅同盟之代表團舉行會議，討論馬歇爾計劃。荷代表團長漢斯區斐爾稱，會中將討論參加馬歇爾計劃的歐洲十六國之關係。</p>
<p>〔合衆社義大利巴里廿四日電〕〕美駐義大使鄧思稱：共產黨講美國意圖將義大昨渝爲美國之殖民地，純係「卑鄙無稽之誹謗」。鄧思初次正式答覆共產黨對美國援歐之攻撃，鄧思挾　左派報紙之攻撃，係對美政府援義計劃之攻撃。左派報紙曾大賣力氣，使義人相信運來　物以供應糧食配給，運來煤斤使工人不致失業即等於美帝國主義，此於誹謗在若干場合竟稱美援之目的係使義大利渝爲美國之殖民地。</p>
<h3>范登堡主設獨立機構　管理馬歇爾方案　如有問題總統有裁決權</h3>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓廿五日電〕國務部長馬歇爾主張援歐計劃由國務部主持執行事宜，已遭多方面反對。參院外交委員會主席范登堡主張另由獨立機關管轄，其計劃係由白魯慶硏究所應范氏之請而擬就，已於昨日由范氏予以發表。內容另設專署，由總統任命及參院核准部長級官員一人爲署長。國務部長及國務部僅得提出問題及抗議，雙方如有爭執，則由總統處理之。此外民主黨參議員喬治亦謂：「余確切主張最後主管機關應獨立。吾人之捐款及用途應由有經驗之行政官員及委員會決定之。」</p>

<p>〔社東京廿四日電〕日聯府正在草擬一五年經濟計劃，希望自一九五一年起，每年能輸出貨物十億元以上，此爲目前輸出額之四倍。美國佔領當局認爲按照現在之經濟進步率，此長期目標自可達到。報紙中曾發表日本之自助計劃，其進口貨每年增加，故在一九五二年仍將入超。本年度計細，輸出一千九百萬美元，輸入七億八千一百萬美元，均爲糧食及工業原料。據佔領當局稱，一九四八年之輸出目標可以達到，惟輸入估計不免太高。</p>

<p>〔合衆社巴達維亞廿五日電〕聯合國調解委員會重要委員廿四日飛赴印尼共和國首都，以視察共和國之閣潮，是否即謂上週印尼與荷蘭所成立之協議已吿完結。內閣係廿三日因國民黨之攻擊而辭職，國民黨對協議條款，大表不滿。副總統哈達擬組新閣，但詳細計劃尙未獲悉。聯合國諸代表係飛往印尼首都者，其中包括美國代表格拉咸，澳洲副代表克列齊裏，比利時副代表弗裏曼及美國務院顧問奧格本。印尼國民黨反對協議條款，　此協議使荷人得暫時控制爪哇及蘇門答臘之豐富產米區及橡皮區。衝突之基本問題爲：荷人在此地區已於一九四二年爲日軍听驅逐，如何尙可保存其控制權。渠等曾於去年同意承認印尼合衆國（由印尼共和國及其他兩烏國組成）與荷蘭王國以平等身份構成荷印聯合王國。共和國代表雖已接受荷蘭之建議，但激動之印尼國民黨則仍堅持完全獨立。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕紐約廿五日廣播：華盛頓訊，蘇聯駐美新大使潘友新，今日首次正式接見美國聯合社記者，主張擴大美蘇貿易，作爲改善美蘇外交關係之一稱步驟。渠謂兩國人民對於此一行動，均感興趣，並指責美國政府若干方面人士企圖以「歧視」性質之規定，阻撓美蘇貿易關係。渠未言明所謂歧視究屬何指，但顯指美國商務部最近宣佈之加緊出口管制。詢以美蘇之間日益增加之異見，是否無可避免者，大使答稱，蘇聯之外交政策，乃以兩大　度可以並存爲出發點。</p>
<h3>赫爾回憶錄　北美報業聯合會版權所有　本報編譯室譯　羅斯福是具有魅力的人物</h3>
<p>在我任職國務院的十二年中，總統和我，從來沒有用不客氣的說話交談過。當然，我們之間有時也發生一些重要的爭論，但是總能誠懇地，直率地，用友好的精神消除異見。大體言之，我們的相處是極相得的。</p>
<p>總統尊重我在受任國務卿時所提出的附帶條件，就是說，我不願意僅僅做我國政府與外國政府之間的一個傳遞消息者，我要充份參與訂定和實施外交政策的工作。</p>
<p>對於國際關係各項問題，他和我在大多數方面有相同的見解。假如我們不在一起時突然有新的發展，我們兩人中的任何一人往往可以猜到另一人將採取的行動。這種在外交政策方面的意見相似，乃是我們之間工作關係良好的一大因素。</p>
<p>以下這些回憶中，我將要寫的是以我國政府處理外交事務的工作爲主。我不擬叙述羅斯福政府在內政方面的成就。關於這些工作，總統是主要的設計者。羅斯福政府從上屆政府承繼下來的國內恐慌局勢，以及在他領導之下所訂定的補救辦法，和實施的空前重大改革，已足以使他在我國的內政史上，獲得一個高超和永久的地位。我也不擬叙述總統在最近一次世界大戰中，担任我國武裝部隊總司令而獲得的成就，除了有關外交軍事聯合政策的若干方面偶然有所涉及，他在軍事方面的出衆成就，又使他成爲我國歷史上才能卓越的總司令之一。總而言之，他是一個眞正偉大的總統。</p>
<p>在我任職國務院期間，我發覺在大多數情形之下，我必須自作決定。雖然在有關政策的重耍問題上，國務卿例應和總統商酌，並且是總統在外交事務方面的代理人，但在實際上，國務卿往往依照他自己的意思行事而自負其責任的。我可以向美國派在國外的代表頒發訓令，要求駐在我國的外國代表提供解釋，向外國政府發出外交照會，以及和這些政府談判條約。</p>
<p>我必須運用我自己的判斷，藉以決定某些政策或者發展是否相當重要，應該讓總統注意。有時候我把一個牽涉新政策的問題送呈於總統之前，並附以適當的建議。在另外一些時候，某項問題雖亦有關政府的政策，但是並不十分重要，母需促使他注意，或者這個問題在一個總政策或者一種已確定的思想範圍之內，而這個政策或者思想，他是早已表示贊同的。</p>
<p>譬如說，在義阿（義大利和阿比西尼亞）戰爭期間，我主張道德制裁，心裏特別注重義大利。當時總統在墨西哥海岸附近的一艘巡洋艦上，我吿訴他假如他贊成的話，我們建議用他的名字宣佈制裁，他當即表示同意了。</p>
<p>另一個例子，就是我們在蒙吉維多泛美會議中爲調解察科戰爭（Chaco　War）而作的努力。我把這件工作，當做大會促進和平各項程序中的一部份看待，並且採取了適當的決定。我把工作進行的一般情形隨時通知總統。</p>
<p>還有一個例子，就是我和英國談判從紐芬蘭和英屬幾內亞租借根據地，以交換美國五十艘過齡的驅逐艦。總統和我就此一問題商談一過，獲得了一般的諒解。於是他就把和英國進行談判的工作，移交給我辦理。爲這樁工作，我整整化了十天，把談判的情形隨時通知總統。當談判結束的時候，我就負責代表政府簽字其上。此外，我還負責和邱吉爾父換過一次電報，當時他正式保證過英國海軍在任何情形之下，決不任其落入德人之手或者自行鑿沉。</p>
<p>其他的例子很多，不勝枚舉。最後一個例子，就是在珍珠港事件之前九個月中，和日本大使進行的談判。我和日本大使舉行了四五十次會議，大部份是在我旅館的公寓中舉行的。我隨時把討論的要點通知總統，同時替總統佈置與大使舉行會議，準備資料。</p>
<p>無論是總統或者我，對於處理外交事務的技術方面，都沒有太多的經驗。由於我們立即遭遇到無數問題必須應付，我們很快地獲得了這種經驗。實施政策以及將基本原則應用到國外亟需解決的種種極端複雜的問題上去，這種重大的工作，大部份落在我的肩上。尤其在初幾年中，由於內政局勢上不可名狀的混亂，需要總統每天加以非常的注意，因此我的工作變得更繁重了。</p>
<p>在羅斯福總統的第一任期中，他浸沉在大量的內政問題中，結果幾乎讓我來完全負責外交方面的工作。我隨時把一切重大的發展充份通知他，但是他希望我在政策和行動方面，發揮主動作用。從他的第二任起，他對於外交工作的興趣和實際的參與，大見增加了。</p>
<p>羅斯福對於國外情形的知識，是極廣泛的。自從傑弗遜和阿特姆斯以來，沒有一個總統對於國外的人民和狀况，具有更廣泛的知識。雖然有時候他直接和別國政府的首長去接洽，使我們不容易應付，此外，他忘記了他軍事決定的外交含義。但是他對於世界的觀點，是進步的，具有限光的。</p>
<p>他是一個在性格上具有極大魅力的人物，在談話之中時常能够使他自己可親而有吸引力，這一點，對於我們應付外國政府的政治家和外交家頗有助益。他對於人類心理，具有一種罕有的判斷力，時常能够把一種主張或者呼籲，最有效地傳達給大衆。在這方面，前輩中除了提奥多·羅斯福（Theodore　Roosevelt）之外，我以爲沒有一個人比得上他。他最得意的表現，就是以極具戲劇性的形式，向世界宣佈偉大的口號和原則，如四大自由之類。他對於人物的廣泛知識以及他的活力，和一直是很準確的判斷，使他極適宜於担任領袖。</p>
<p>除了極少數的例外，總統在我任職國務卿的十二年中，簡直不大能够關心得更周到的了。他幾乎毫無例外地核准我的意見或建議，這些意見和建議往往是牽涉到重耍的外交政策的。除了他和邱吉爾和史達林舉行在他看來主要是屬於軍事性質的會議之外，他在外交關係採取重要步驟之前，簡直總來徵詢我的意見或同意。在許多許多次情形之下，他希望我供給有關外交演說的題材，或者協助他起草咨文，以及向邱吉爾，史達林和其他政府首長提出答覆。</p>
<p>霍普·金（Harry　Hopkins）有一次對我說，一個人可以替羅斯福總統服務，不論多久，總統永不會謝他的。但是霍普金接下來又說，事實上羅斯福對於這種人替他所做的一切工作，總是感激的。我回答說，我同他的關係一向沒有間隙，從無間言。我還說，在許多情形之下，他對於我工作的若干方面，表示充份的欣賞。</p>
<p>當總統或者我從旅行回來，或者隔了一個時期之後，他幾乎總來通知我，請我到他的辦公處去吃中飯，因此我們可以談論各種問題和情形，不受擾亂。</p>
<p>午餐拿了進來（沒有酒類），放在他橢圓形的辦公室中的大辦公桌上。這個辦公室對我是很熟悉的。就在這個房間中，我第一次遇見威爾遜總統，其後又遇見柯立芝和胡佛總統。</p>
<p>我們的談話是非正式的。總統時常有一只剛聽到的有趣的故事，講出來聽。其後，我們就可以談論當前的問題約一小時。我們總祇有兩個人，極少打擾，雖然有時候重要的人打電話來時，總統須去作答。</p>
<p>在談話中，他一直是顧到對方的。有時候我們對重要問題意見相左時，我從反對的方面辯論，他從沒有表示沒有耐性過。他注意靜聽，直到完畢，不來打斷對方的設話。常我們中間一人知道對方經過充份考慮而抱有確定的信念時，就會在適當的時間，避免過份的辯論的。</p>
<p>我們的談話幾乎是完全關於外交事務的，但有時候我會毫不躊躇地對內政上的一般問題表示意見。有幾次我彷彿這樣說過「從我靑年時代起，我曾經研究過自由思想的導師像洛克，密爾登，庇得，柏克，和格蘭斯登以及魯意。喬治學派。我曾受過威爾遜的自由思想的薰陶，我前在國會中的工作記錄，有百分之九十至一百涉及勞工，主要是關於進步的立法的。但是我還不能不覺得你在若干內政改革方面進行得太快太遠，沒有充份的時間去適應國內的條件。民衆沒有時間去消化它們。我認爲國家週期地需要時間來適應若干激烈的新政策，並且在若干方面，政策本身似乎太激烈一點。」</p>
<p>我並且說明，我並不贊同政府永遠費去大量金錢去應付國內問題的政策，一向主張根據進步的切實的政策，來達到預算平衡的目的，國家在各重要方面的合理進步，均需以此爲健全的基礎。</p>
<p>總統的熊度總是非常尊敬，聽我講完。其後，他就繼續吃飯或吸烟，不說什麼話。經過幾秒鐘的靜默之後，他或者我提起一些其他的事情，談話於是轉入了另一個方向。</p>

<h3>楊浚明談身份問題</h3>
<p>上海記者公會會員嚴服周等百餘人，具呈全國職婦選所調査東歐國代候選人之楊浚明之身份問題，已載前報。昨日楊浚明適因事來滬，華東社記者特往訪問。據楊談：渠今晨方自南京返滬，對本市記者公會會員函選總調査其資格一節，在京並無所聞。來滬後因尙未及閱讀前昨兩日報紙，故一切詳情渠一切詳情　一無所知。記者復詢其過去經歷，渠答，在各方面都做過事，因愧無建樹，新聞界對渠難免有陌生之感。惟此次參加國大競選，係由黨方（民社黨）提名，如記者公會會員確有此舉，渠個人毫無意見，俟選總正式答復公告後，渠信黨方或有意見代作表示。最後詢以對記者公會會員之舉措，是否感到突然，渠笑稱，何不詢諸記者公會會員。</p>
<h3>張曉崧辭職　吳市長慰留</h3>
<p>本市民政局長張曉崧氏，主持民政已歷兩年，過去辦理戶口整編征集兵役及國大代表立委選舉，工作繁重，勞績卓著。現以政躬違和，突提出辭呈。聞吳市長對張氏請辭，已予慰留。唯昨據張局長對華東社記者表示，本人體力不支，願即退讓賢路，辭意極爲堅決，如此次不獲核准，準備再上辭呈。</p>
<h3>潘議長應邀　今廣播演講</h3>
<p>潘議長應本市警察局長兪叔平之邀，定今日下午三時一刻，在該局總局北部七樓廣播，講題爲：「請市民注意參議會的動態」</p>
<h3>俞部長等再會商　食米全面配售決三月起實行</h3>
<p>配給數量可能變更</p>
<p>糧食部長兪飛鵬氏，於前日來滬後，昨日下午六時邀集吳市長，社會局吳局長，暨民食調配委員會常務委員任顯羣等，再度商討關於本市全面配給食米有關事宜，及民食調配委員會擴大組織問題。據社會局長吳開先氏語記者：兪部長此次來滬，對於本市配給食米，決定自三月份起開始實施，數量原訂每人每月二斗，其中一斗由政府配給，另十斗則發給准購證，向市塲購買。惟據俞部長表示：糧部近據外國專家硏究意見，每人每月食米消耗量，一斗五升即可敷川。最近糧食部於配給數量方面，尙在考慮中，將米可能每人每月配給一斗八升，由政府配給八升，另發一斗米之准購設，至配給食米之價格，吳氏表示可能按當月市價六折計算。蓋目前本市產職業工人配給每担二十四萬元，係根據常時市價六折所決定云。又全面配給實施以後，此項事務，將由本市民食調配委員會負責配給。惟該會編制甚小，前　　　　委　請行政院擴大改組機構，另由中央派員主持，以利配給事務之推行，據悉，兪都長對改組後之配給機構，擬請吳市長任主任委員，吳局長及任顧羣任副主任委員，將來是否仍用「民食　配委員會」原名，抑改爲其他名義，尙未決定，惟改組日期，於二月上旬當可發表。</p>
<h3>社會局召集糧商　今晨舉行談話會</h3>
<p>本市爲最先辦理糧食全面配給之地區，社會局爲使本市糧商明悉配糧意義及具體辦法，特定於今日晨九時，召集本市南北糧食市塲管理員，舉行談話會，報吿配給食米各項有關事宜。</p>
<h3>永嘉米價高漲　同鄕籌商運濟</h3>
<p>永嘉及其鄰縣本爲產米之區，平時米價遠較上海爲低，近頃突吿飛漲，每十萬元僅糴七斤，即每石售價高達二百二十萬兀，且糧源欠通，覓糴不易，人心惶惶，形勢甚爲嚴　。日前溫州旅滬同鄕會召開理監事會議，即由該會埋事長姚抱眞提出永嘉糧荒應如何接濟一案，嗣該會復接永嘉社會人士聯名電請採購米麵，運溫平　。該會特於日昨召開緊急座談會，因滬溫間食糧禁運，爰決議電請糧食部給證准向蕪湖採講食米一萬包，運溫濟急，並推定徐寄廎，姚抱眞，張亦苗三人晋京請命，聞該會已電請糧部</p>
<h3>銀樓金交易　新正可望恢復</h3>
<p>自國務會議通過開放飾金交易辦法後，本市銀樓業已積極籌備復業。復業經濟行政處已開始辦理銀樓業重行登記事宜，經審核合格後，即發給臨時營業執照。據悉：此一工作，將於廢曆年底前辦竣，新正起可望全部復業。現成爲問題者，僅工資部份尙待商討，根據中央規定，飾金出售價格，除平衡會掛牌外，另加營　　用百分之四十，合法利潤百分之二十，惟連同工資在內，不得超過百分之九十二，今滬市要求爲百分之百，與中央規定相差無幾，故復業問題，大致可告解決。</p>
<h3>風雪載途訪庇寒所　難民多呼吃不飽跪地哀求出外來　冰凍蒲匯塘疏濬告停頓</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕連日風雪載途，冬令救濟會加緊收容難民工作，並至各區發放寒衣。流動施粥車亦於昨日出動，以輔助各施粥站之不足。救濟會副主任委員社會局長吳開先，於昨日上午偕同查放組副組長社局第四處長袁文彰及各報記者，同往第三工賑庇寒所及第一第二庇寒所視察。</p>
<p>第三工賑庇寒所地址在中山路一號橋，收容難民二百五十名，祖任疏濬蒲匯塘工作，膳宿於新搭之草棚中。庇寒所難民規定每人每月給米二斗，工賬難民因需勞力工作，故特別規定每人每日食米二十四兩。彼等每開掘土方一方，可得工資一萬五千元。如工作動奮，日可開掘二方。但在此寒風拂面如刀割之曠野中，欲赤足下河工作，亦苦事耳。昨日嚴寒，河中氷塊壘壘，開掘工作遂吿停頓。</p>
<p>第一庇寒所在漕河涇冠生園農塲旁舊殘疾所址，至今收容壯丁難民七三五人，難童三七九人，共三四人。第二庇寒所在滬閔公路生生牧塲內，共收容老弱婦孺九一〇人。吳局長前往視察時，難民多呼「吃不飽」，更有跪地哭求出外者。吳局長當囑各所管理人員，今後於煮飯量米時，可由難民推派代表會同辦理。</p>
<p>奇寒再創紀錄　終日氣溫零度以下</p>
<p>西伯里亞大寒流籠罩之下，本市昨日天氣整日處於朔風凛冽之中，溫度始終在零度以下。據氣象台消息，大寒流的中心刻已逐漸侵抵長江下游，致本市溫度創嚴寒新紀錄，最高僅華氏二十八度八，合攝氏零下一度八，最低僅華氏二十四度，爲攝氏零下四度三，而西北風怒吼，風力達四級之巨，此項嚴冷之氣候，將有數日之維持，但以寒流中心已正面襲滬之中，故今日太市天氣將較昨更爲寒冷。茲誌天氣預測如下。黃海；曇而冰凍，霾，中度北風中浪。華中：陰轉曇，冷霾，局部雪或霧，晨夕有霧，淸勁北風，上海：陰轉曇，冷而冰凍，霾淸勁西北風至北風，晨夕有輕務。東海：陰，冷，沿海雨或濛，强烈北風，東南部及九州四週有雨，巨浪，台灣四週海浪凶湧。</p>
<h3>社局决心禁舞　展期要求　不予考慮</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕本市二十九家舞廳依禁舞實施辦法規定，應於本月底抽籤淘汰一半，於三月底停業。其餘於九月底全部關閉。社會局吳局長昨申述禁舞決心，對舞廳業　方及舞女職工於日前開會要來展延抽籤事，表示不予考慮。社會局決依遵中央辦法執行。關於抽籤事，前囑舞廳業同業公會自行辦理，而由社會局派員監督。現爲期在即，如屆時舞廳業方而拒絕抽籤，則社會局將於三十一日在局抽定應行淘汰之舞廳，飭於三月底停。</p>
<h3>菜市場焚毀地貨業無屋　重建請求市府拒絕</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕本市閘北西區中央菜市塲焚毀以後，蔬菜集中安置甚感困難，時屆嚴冬，無屋遮蔽，菜蔬　吿冰凍。公會負責人特呈文市府，請求准其在原址蓋搭瓦房。市府特於前日下午三時，召集各有關機關舉行地貨業會議，由市府參事王兆荃主席，出席工務局長趙祖康，及社會局，地政局，敎育局，閘北西區計劃委員會等代表十餘人。會中決議：對重建瓦房之請求，絕對無法接受。原因有二：　與都市計劃相抵觸。按閘北西區已列爲都市計劃示範區，中央菜市塲原址，已劃爲最優越之住宅區，自不容再有菜市場之建造。　地權未清，該地之土地權，非市場方面所有，業主有權收回，市府自無法發給建造執照。然市府當局，因該地爲本市菜蔬集中區域，爲恐影構菜市價格起見，特由地政局在曹家渡覓得公地一塊，供建市塲之用。惟須經提參議會通過，及呈行政院核准。惟曹家渡公地，各　關呈請需用者甚多，會中決議，請吳市長予以特准。</p>
<p>暫准搭草房</p>
<p>又上項租賃手續，辦理須耗時一二月，且搭建亦需相當時日，中央市塲方面，已表示來及等待。現該會決准其即”起，在　　贊時蓋搭草房若干間，置蕨菜蔬，惟俟曹家渡公地租賃手鐵　妥後，立即拆去，庶不妨礙本市都市計劃之進行。</p>
<h3>茶荘小老虎　身價五千萬</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕金陵中路一六五號大同茶莊裏陳利的一隻小老虎至今尙未售去，記者昨天去看的時候，它閉着眼睛蜷縮在籠子的一隅，神態很有　　的樣子。</p>
<p>這一雙小老虎是一位徽州人在山野間獵獲後帶到上海來寄售的，自從報上登出消息以後，去看的人倒着實不少，想買的也不乏其人。有幾位顧主願意出兩千萬元左右，有一位外國人願意出五十元美金，但虎主的討價要五千萬元，雙方相差太遠，所以都不能成交，據茶莊裏的夥計說，萬金油老闆胡文虎曾派人來看過。畫虎名家張大千也親自來「鑑賞」，他嫌老虎太小，還不够入盡的資格。小老虎的皮色與「竹節貓」差不多，看上去並不怎樣美麗。大同茶莊昨天向城隍廟動物院借到了一隻大鐵籠，，今天起就要將它從原來的小木籠裏喬遷了。茶莊裹夥計們每天晚上還把它從籠子裏放出來用鍊條牽着玩，據說祇要不去惹怒它，小老虎是不會咬人的。</p>

<h3>戡亂建國宣傳　整日熱烈舉行</h3>
<p>國民黨上海市黨部，爲加强戡亂建國動員宣傳，昨日雖星期日，仍由該部宣傳處談處長，親率宣傳大隊全體工作同志百餘人，特備大卡車二輛，分化裝宣傳及演說二組，自晨至晚，冒雪出發本市各區宣傳，車經南京路時，高呼口號，至民國路時，並有本市兒童敎養所樂隊參加，該大隊宣傳組在新閘路，長樂路等十餘處，表演共匪暴行之街頭劇，劇情逼眞，觀衆咸爲感動。演說組分赴南京，滬光，蓬萊，及共舞台等戲院，作簡單演說，聽衆莫不動容，尤以新華舞廳演說畢後，全塲高唱義勇軍進行曲，情緒頗爲緊張熱烈。</p>
<h3>當櫻花怒放之日殆敵酋定讞之時　最終辯論庭週內可舉行　梅汝璈今晨飛東京返任</h3>
<p>我國派駐遠東國際法庭代表法官梅汝璈氏，週前返國述職，業已公學，定今晨七時，乘美西北公司客機飛東京返任。據梅氏昨對記者稱：遠東國際法庭本週內即可舉行「最終辯論庭」，由檢察官及被吿雙方各將其準備就緒之「綜合辯狀」，向庭上提出宣讀，該項辯狀乃雙方就開審廿個月以來法庭所接受之一切證件及全部法庭紀錄，加以分析檢討，各作論斷，互相辯難，其中不僅歸納事實，且可涉及法律問題，是項辯狀，大部分業已完成，並由雙方於事前互相交換審閱，俾彼此針鋒相對，不涉題外，此種態度，實至公允開明，誠所謂「其爭也君子」。</p>
<p>評論會議·需時較長</p>
<p>梅氏預料雙方綜合辯狀之篇幅，必在三千頁以上，約需四星期始能宣讀完畢，辯論庭終止，公開審訊即吿完結，繼之則爲十一國法官之評論會議，決定廿五名被吿之刑度，並撰擬判詞，然後定期宣判，法庭亦即宣吿閉庭。記者詢以閉庭期間評論會議約需若干時日及何時始正式宣判，梅氏答稱：此事余目前尙不能作肯定性之預測，紐倫堡國際法庭泆官會議僅費廿九日，但東京案情複雜，涉及之年代較久，被吿亦較多，而證件及法庭紀錄之數量，均超過紐倫堡一倍有奇，故評論會議之時間，東京當較紐倫堡爲長，是可斷言。惟據個人逆料，大約本年四月間在瀛櫻花怒放之日，殆即爲敵酋定獻之時。</p>
<p>根絕侵略·促進和平</p>
<p>記渚復詢及將來各犯之刑度大約如何，其中幾人可望判以極刑，梅氏答稱，依照一般司法慣例，法官對於未結案件，不宜有評論，對於裁判結果，尤不宜作任何預示，惟遠東國際法庭不適用「自由心證」而純採「物證主義」，故法官同人對於雙方之肆意宣傳，決不重視，但對於罪跡昭彰，證據確鑿之戰犯，必不任其在莊嚴的國際法律正義裁判之下，有所脫逃。最後梅氏復以堅決語氣吿記者曰：東京審判之目的，絕不僅在日本廿五名特級戰犯之生死刑度，而係在確定一種新的國際法制度原則，以根絕國際間之侵略思想行動，俾有助於促進世界之永久和平，本此觀點，東京審判雖耗大量人力財力，實有其歷史上的震大意義，及神聖使命。</p>

<h3>國際飯店經理考察歸來　暢談歐美旅館事業近況</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕國際飯店經理林勉之最近應世界旅業公會及美旅業協會之邀，週遊歐美各國，考察各地旅館設備及營業狀况，爲期四月之久。林氏業於日前返滬，昨與記者談及此行觀感稱：美國任何事業均以大規模經營，旅館亦然。如最大之一家斯蒂文斯（Stevens）旅館，房間達三千餘間之多，旅館本身即如一小城市，衣食住行式式俱全。普通旅館約有五百間至二千問，最少者亦在一百五十間以上。同時，屬於同一組織之分支旅館，遍佈各地，幾與商業上之托辣斯制度相近。管理及設備之優良，自不待言，效率尤其注重。例如收費利用特殊設計之機器，凡旅客任何消費行爲發生之數秒鐘內，即可將賬單開出。旅館門戶大都用紅外綫原理自動啓閉。</p>
<p>美國缺乏力歐洲缺乏糧食</p>
<p>惟服侍方面，因美國人力缺乏，故尙不如我國旅館之週到。最近美國旅館事業有兩事値得一提，一爲沿公路搭建之活動旅館，增設日多。此項活動旅館因其便利舒適，吸引旅客不少，致使正式旅館營業大受影響。二爲旅館中之烹飪人才漸感缺乏，負責者頗爲担心。</p>
<p>歐洲方面，戰後創痍尙未全復，同時食糧缺乏，配給制度嚴格執行，旅館之設備及供應自較美國爲差。倫敦尤其不佳。然其價格之昂，則爲全世界冠。第一流旅館每日房金達五鎊至十鎊之巨</p>
<p>公會組織嚴密精神值得效法</p>
<p>林氏最後抒述其感想數點：　旅館業爲旅行事業之一部份，歐美各國政府對旅館業均有輔助合作，我國如欲發展旅行事業，吸引外資，政府對於旅館業亦應予以扶植。　歐美旅業同業公會組織甚爲嚴密，會員均能開誠合作，共謀發展，其精神殊值我人效法。　歐美各國對於旅館業服務人員毫無輕視之意，我國傳統觀念則絕然相反，因此使資格好能力高之靑年，均不屑在旅館中服務，坐而人才缺乏，發展爲難。此種觀念，實須加以改變。</p>

<h3>調劑肺病患者身心　病人復元工塲　昨日開幕典禮　肺病醫院故院長紀念碑同時揭幕</h3>
<p>［本報訊］經美國醫學界辦理三十年之經驗，公認為有利於肺病患者治愈後恢復健康的一種「病人復元工塲，巳在上海防癆協會虹橋路肺病第一醫院設立。昨日中午該院特舉行工塲開幕典禮，同時爲防癆協會創辦人暨肺病醫院故院長海深德醫師紀念碑揭幕。</p>
<p>「病人復元工塲」是給肺病極　和巳愈的病人作為調劑身心的一種手工工塲，它不僅可使已愈的人仍可得到休養的機會，而且使病人精神上，得到一種安慰。因為大家都知道，生了肺病的人是最怕發生心理上的恐懼和憂慮的。</p>
<p>根據大國醫學界二十三年來的統計結果肺病患者出院後六個月至十八個月中，巳愈的病人有百分之五十因原病復發而死亡，後來辦了復元工塲，使那些原來要出院的病人仍留在院中，給與工作，則一方面做些輕便手工，一方面仍可得到醫院方面的照料，安心休息，這樣過了二三年後再行出院，在五年中一百人中紙死去十個人。又有一種學業生，即在工塲中留得更久的，出院後經調查，在五年中一百個人中僅有三人死去，其死亡率是和普通一般的。所以他們相信這種工作是絕對有效，寧可使病人在院中多留幾年。而不願把過去數　來的時間，精力和金錢都枉費了。</p>
<p>感覺乏力即行休息</p>
<p>第一肺病醫院現任院長歐陽靜戈，此次得上海防癆協會美國支會贊助，到美國考察，在美十四個月，回國後，就把這新辦法帶回中國立即舉辦。現在肺病醫院中參加工作者巳有二十多人，出晶亦相當精彩，有絨綫織品，有小玩具，更有梁超　工程師領導自製「Hhncon」牌各式打火機，已在市面上出售。將來出品更多一些準備拿出去賣，這樣得到一點敢　也可以貼補醫院開支。而病人們工作時間最多一天一二小時，一感覺乏力即停止工作休息，大家輪流做工。復元工塲極盼社會人士能捐助舊縫衣機以及手工　各種工具，俾使病人藉此機會多學習一些技能。</p>
<p>應歸功海深德醫師</p>
<p>至於講到防癆這一種重大工作，今日能在中國推進，那不得不歸功于美國海深德醫師。昨日在舉行紀念碑揭幕禮前，富文　醫師特代表防癆協會會長顏惠慶（因患感冒未出席），報告海醫師生前事跡，略述海深德醫師在中國抗戰前即在上海服務，他對於很少人願意去做的麻瘋病治療工作曾特別注意，當時即和歐陽醫生共同合作過。上海戰事發生，海醫師見到難民敢容所的年老疾病及肺癆病患者最爲痛苦，無人注意，於是他就在　齊路創設一防癆協會，接着借白利南路一所醫院設立肺病醫院，當時曾得該會名譽會長施肇基以及美紅十字會兒童福利委會等協助，得使二百多病人全部免費治療。</p>
<p>被敵　閉不幸逝世</p>
<p>海氏身兼防癆協會秘書長，肺病醫院院長，醫務設計三大重職，後又在愚園路濟良所辦第二醫院。十二月八日太平洋戰爭發生，白利南路醫院不容存在，海醫師幸得各界捐助約得一百萬元，就把虹橋路現址買下，而將白利南路院內病人全部搬進去。不幸海醫師後被敵人關在集中營內，得病而逝於同仁醫院。富醫師最後稱：「我們要紀念海醫師並不能僅以一塊銅碑來表示，這防癆工作的推進，肺病醫院的擴展即是紀念海醫師最好的表示」</p>
<p>最新透視機　裝在汽車上</p>
<p>歐陽醫師此次回國會帶來美國捐助最新透視機一架，即將裝在汽車上，到處爲市民照射以防肺病或及早醫治，每日可照六百人。防癆協會美支會施肇基博士並在美發動捐募，巳得五萬美元，將來擬擴充第一醫院病房。該院病房收費極廉，頭等包括一日伙食及其他費用，每日三十萬元，並有半角及全免費者，一部由衛生局津貼。又當初與海醫師其同工作之外科主任美籍方基醫師，至今猶爲肺病醫院義務疹療，運車馬費亦不拿分文。</p>
<p>昨日揭幕者爲海醫師長女公子，亦爲醫師，服務聯總，次女公子爲藥劑師，海夫人現在美國，當時亦助海醫師參加工作，可謂一門皆爲中國造福也。</p>

<h3>爪哇僑胞的厄運　需要自救·同時需要祖國政府的協助</h3>
<p>〔本報爪哇吧城十四日航訊〕我們華僑向海外發展，依歷史所記載，當以荷屬　印度的最先。我們僑居吧城多年的人深深知道，現在居留吧城的僑胞頗多已經是六代子孫，甚至有的八九代相傳。我國一向沒有移民政策，華僑之離鄕背井，鳳泊　飄，全靠同鄉戚串之資助，或族人友好之「招呼」，好容易到達僑居地之後，亦多爲學徒苦力，時刻與貧病結不解緣，經過長期間之刻苦耐勞，動儉銖積，其幸而成家創業者，少之又少，其不幸而困死他鄉者，實極繁夥。就全體而言，華僑中勞工寒賤之衆，十居八九，家擁鉅資的富翁，仍屬寥若晨星。我們　國同胞，對華僑首先要有這樣的認識，切莫把華僑與富　兩個　念，粘在一塊兒。</p>
<p>進一步來觀察，許多成功的華僑，其所積聚的財產，多數是商業資本，華僑經營的事業，（如三保　黃建源之糖業）附庸於當地的宗主國，限於殖民地政策，及無社國法律保護。他們的資本，永遠不能變成近代工業資本，證於數十年來事實的敎訓，惟日趨衰替破產，絕不是欣欣向榮。我們對於戰前爪哇富有的華僑，不能忘記，而且必須指出這個基本的厄運。</p>
<p>「仲介商」地位動搖</p>
<p>華僑人口之衆，與密度之高，以爪哇爲最。在這島上，無論山陬海隅，窮鄉僻壤，都有華僑的「答弄」，（即販賣日用品的小商店）和土著印尼人，最爲接近。華僑的經濟地位，足以控制整個印尼人的經濟生活。華僑是印尼人和荷蘭統治國家人民間的「仲介商」。土產由華僑收集，日用品由華僑販賣，從中獲取有限的微利。</p>
<p>自從印尼民族大聲疾呼「美的加」的時候，我們華僑首先陷入漫大烽火，戰雲低迷的環境中。印荷衝突的結果，僑胞在夾縫中遭遇生命的傷亡，財產的損失，甚且有許多已經走入了「毀滅之　」。即僥倖未罹戰禍的僑胞，又因荷蘭統制政策之實施，印尼人民民族本位經濟的抬頭，使華僑「仲介商」的地位，根本動搖。且經過日寇三年佔領期間，向印尼人之盡情挑撥煽惑，印尼人把我們過去開荒闢廢之偉績，完全抹煞，竟目華僑爲「吸血虫」，「猶太人」，「剝削階段」，而普遍的造成仇華排華空氣，制定了種種色色對華僑不利的法令，軍隊則毫無紀律，人民又賦性兇殘，殺人刧掠，視爲常事。</p>
<p>此外，華僑社會，一　意見紛歧，鈎心鬥角，近且陷於半分裂的狀態。籍貫和幫派的分野，「左傾份子」與「黨團」之洪溝。最近吧城爲了響應戡亂通電的事情，鬧得滿城風雨，地暗天愁。迄今雙方，仍繼續展開筆戰。使華僑大難當頭的今日，還不能立刻國結應付危機，因此，對外的力量，無形中削弱。</p>
<p>這種種厄運，已足陷華僑於十八層阿鼻地獄。記者盱衡世變，遠測未來，對於東印度華僑不幸遭此多重厄運，不能不令人憂心如焚！</p>
<p>溫敬多等人印尼籍</p>
<p>祖國政府，一向關懷華僑，重視華僑的，我們國父，且稱一華僑爲革命之母」。自辛亥革命至七七抗戰，華僑始終爲祖國的大補給站。尤其是抗戰以來，因爲抗戰的初三年，中央每年抗戰經費的支出，海外華僑差不多負担四分之一，同時抗戰，也提高了華僑對　祖國政治的發言權。可是，自　抗戰勝利之後，接着祖國內亂　發，給海外華僑一個莫大的失　，華僑心懷妄念，以爲祖國抗戰勝利之日，便是華僑吐氣揚眉之時，事實上，自從勝利之後，華僑的整個危機，反日益加深。一方面，由於祖國政府沒有迅速明朗有力的外交政策，和積極有效的措施。他方面又因一般思想不純正的份子，潛入華僑社會各階層，對祖國政府作無理的攻擊，與盡情的挑撥，遂使僑胞對祖國由失望，怨恨，而傾向於「離心」運動。甚至有不少僑胞，正在考慮是否索性加入印尼國籍的問題？今日溫敬多（足球健將，暨南大學畢業），蕭玉燦（現榮膺印尼閣僚）之流：已正式入了印尼國籍，正在爪哇內地，竭心盡力做摧殘華僑的工作。</p>
<p>華僑自救刻不容緩</p>
<p>我們認爲橫在我們眼前最急切的問題，便是華僑自救的問題。我們知道政府派兵保僑，‘不要說事實上難辦到，縱使政府肯這樣做，反面的作用，必大於正面的效果。大規模的撤僑，更不可能，客觀環境，也不容許。從未入國門一步的僑生，呌他撤去那裏呢？這樣看來，除了華僑自救，和祖國政府協助，別無他圖。</p>
<p>爲了國族，爲了僑運，把華僑的商業資本，應迅速變成祖國的工業獨立資本，我們的意思，並不是主張華僑中小資產家，連根帶蒂拔回來，也決非期望一朝一夕，主張把華僑全部撤退。但最低限度，我們敢說，華僑不能坐而待亡，應提高警覺踏進參加祖國的生產，才是出路，才有前途。不過華僑在這裏經營的事業，泰半非近代的組織方式，華僑人才近代生產技術，尙極幼穉。祖國政府，應該有一個統一指導機關，專辦華僑回國投資的事務，政府且耍立法保證華僑投資的利潤。這樣一來，華僑資本，必將源源流歸。</p>
<p>組保安隊暴徒歛跡</p>
<p>其次，要談到華僑救急的問題：現在荷軍佔領區，已先後成立了華僑保安隊。成立以來，頗能執行其神聖的職務，駐有華僑保安隊的地方，印尼暴徒較前稍爲歛跡。這是我們引以爲慰的。猶憶一週前，普禾拉蒂埠，因無荷軍駐守，被一百餘名暴徒衝入市內，該埠有僑胞五百餘人，特派代表要求保安隊開往該處駐紥，保安隊乃徇僑胞之請特派一小隊七人包括一小隊長，聯同當地靑年廿人，協同保護。拒該隊剛開抵該處，暴徒即向保安除突擊，保安隊乃奮勇應戰，雙方開火兩小時，暴促卒潰退。調査實况，始發現保安隊員劉錦隆君，壯烈殉職。暴徒則遺屍三貝，兩爲印尼人，一爲日寇。保安隊員劉君之壯烈犧牲，他是爲了保護僑衆生命財產而犧牲的，「民族英雄」一名，劉君應可當之無愧。同時足以證明華僑保安隊確能發　其保僑的力量。</p>
<p>上月鈕樹榷領事，親到中爪哇各地視察僑情，目擊華僑備受流亡集中之痛，巧取豪奪之苦，這些地方，都是印尼共和區，不能把責任推給荷蘭人。</p>
<p>因此外交次長葉公超，主張印尼共和區，亦須成立保安隊，這種要求是最適時適切而必須促其早日實現的。這裏一般輿論認爲：內地華僑，目前遭受痛苦最深的，是印尼政府藉口便以保護，而被集中的華僑，華僑一被集中，不特所有財產即被印尼暴徒焚刧一空，而僑胞們的生命，在這毫無計劃集中之下，也完全失去保陣僑胞們，或被殺於中途，或病死餓死於山竅，其凄慘情况，令人不忍想像。旣然有許多事　證明，接近戰區華僑生命財產，毫無保障，則印尼常局前日之拒絕允許華僑自組保安隊，可謂毫無理由。我們希望祖國外交部，應向印尼當局力爭，以期迅速促其實現。</p>
<p>三令五申與事無補</p>
<p>印尼總統蘇加諾，最近訓勉民衆，須嚴守國民紀律，這是値得注意與欣慰的事。然而，誠如蘇加諾總統自已所說，對民衆說話，倘無行動證明，仍無補於事實。</p>
<p>但自震動全世界的文登慘案發生以來，印尼當局表面雖有悔禍之心，曾三令五申，命民衆守法保僑，並對我國保證將懲兇賠償，但截至現在，何嘗拘留過一個兇首，或槍決過一個暴徒即由於這種說話與保證，毫無行動用以證明，故此次荷蘭的「警衛行動」一發動，印尼暴徒，遂益無忌憚，對我僑不斷的屠殺與焚刦了。</p>
<p>現在舉世注目的安理會三國委員，忙來忙去似乎尙沒有一點兒成就。我們早已認爲安理會對印荷糾紛之調處，原在「聊盡人事」，純取敷衍印荷雙方。荷方似自始即未重視過安理會的決議，雖然不敢過拂若干大國的「好意」調處。印尼方面，則心懷妄念，以爲國際壓力，可以使荷蘭退讓。看了這三方面的做作，都令人預感到印尼局勢明朗無期。只可憐我們飄寄爪哇內地的華僑，不知何年何月才得脫離苦海。（特約記者黃海震）</p>

<h3>勘測草嶺水庫　可能灌漑七十五萬畝</h3>

<p>福廈公路略圖　本報資料室繪</p>
<h3>千餘萬人期望興修　福厦公路</h3>
<p>〔本報福州十五日航訊〕福厦公路，這是條聯結閩東閩南兩塊富庶地區的唯一交通脈管，抗戰以前這兒早就通車；那時從閩江畔的福州，到語音完全不同的僑都——厦門，僅僅只要耗一天車程，榕厦間的客貨運讓這路担負了一半，可是通車不久就逢到戰爭。厦門隔壁的金門一經陷落，這條路頓成爲「盲腸」，當局爲預防敵人乘勢內犯計，廿七年澈頭澈尾地把它破壞了。</p>
<p>八年來，福厦路一直癱瘓着，一塊塊土方長上靑草，一片片路基夷爲民田，橋梁頹圯了，里程碑也滬沒了，同樣的路程，從福州到厦門要足足步行五天，機器與人工在這里給人這麼一個深刻的比照！</p>
<p>閩省當局是在抗戰勝利第二天起便嚷着要搶修這條公路了，省公路局建設廳一直忙着編造計劃準備勘測，然而作爲一條相當於浙贛路杭州到玉山站那樣長的工程幹起來談何容易，而且復員伊始，百端待舉，庫藏經費着實更感空虛，於是計劃一擱，便被擱了一年多，直到去年行總閩辦事處成立，印着（UNRRA）的救濟物資源源運到後，復路的呼聲才恢復，後來畢竟由於中央之重視設法交通和聯總外籍工程人員之熱心協助，「福厦工程處」正式成立，接着就開始了艱鉅的復路工作。</p>
<p>從福州到厦門</p>
<p>綫路是如此伸展的：起點福州市南門兜，經白湖亭，峽北，渡過烏龍江，在峽南登陸，經塲口，再超過全程最高峯相思嶺，達宏路，漁溪，江口，涵江鎭，入蕭田縣，再經楓亭，進惠安城，出杏田，這兒穿過了歷史上著名的洛陽橋便至泉州（晋江），再經前埔，官橋，水頭，馬港至同安縣，又經灌口，角尾，嵩嶼過海入廈門，全程二百九十八公里，（上半截是福建茶米出產地區，中半截是福建菓糖出產地區，下半截是百分七十閩僑的故鄕（潭泉地區），從經濟觀點上看這路，顯然它的重量也不亞於其他省任何公路的）·福厦路憑着聯總物資的有力帮助，當時復路總費用預算僅十九億元，然而幾經更迭，時過境遷，工程一開始，便遭遇困難，直到今天，時間經過一年，工資耗費達千億，才僅打通福州至漁溪的上小段路，與論界在這種情形之下，不免是要議論指摘的。</p>
<p>以記者一向參觀外省鐵路工程經過情形看來，福厦路的工程是難令人滿意的。</p>
<p>公路恢復困難</p>
<p>程度不比鐵路，尤其令人欽羨的是該路竟擁有大量復路機械，這較之當年人工開闢公路不知省力多少，（按該路現有平土機三輛，推土機三輛，卸土卡車廿三輛，福特卡車五輛，壓路機三輛，機械修理車六輛，軋石機三輛，括土機三輛，汽壓開山機四輛，羊蹄壓路機三輛，水車三輛，其他機械不知多少，其中推土機每天可推土二萬方尺，軋石機每天可軋碎塊石八九十塊，削泥如紙，壓石如磨，均甚適用），而工程開始迄今，竟若蝸牛爬行，此中情形，局外人確不易原諒，記者認爲一項工程的進行，固然需要物力配合人工，然而更其需要</p>
<p>人工策動物力</p>
<p>器械僅是器械，經費亦僅是經費，當事者不僅要知道利用，更要運用得好利用得澈底，否則器械，財力，人工相互矛盾脫節，能不失敗者幾希？前時浙贛路趕修的成功就靠這點，想來福廈公路工程的遲滯發展，也不外乎此吧。</p>
<p>此間輿論界，有人說：「福厦路依復無期」，也有人破口大駡：「福厦工程，一塌糊塗」。語調雖皆有些火氣，都也道出了福建千餘萬人民對該路期望的心情。的確福厦路在今後福建的交通，經濟，軍事，政治各方面的關係是太重要了，從任何方面着想，記者都盼該處同人加緊努力，早日完成。（特約記者黃岑）</p>

<h3>江陰雙山沙　中的樂園</h3>
<p>〔本報廿二日江陰訊〕澄屬沙洲，地處江濱，在東沙坍西沙漲不斷的變遷，眞是滄海　田，在東外張家港口外，有一處名雙山沙，長約十多華里，寬六七華里，居民五百多戶，竹籬茅舍，富有「鷄聲茅店月人跡板橋霜」風味，依然仳外桃源，此沙在十八年前，因江水挾泥沙俱下，被長巫二山脚所阻，積而爲灘，十數年來積成，故名雙山沙，開墾到現在，不過二十八年。初來開田時候，因見</p>
<p>泥少烏黑　題名鐵板沙，在江南隔江眺望，那沙在江中，宛似一條大黑魚，所以又名黑魚沙。民國十八年邑紳士吳汀鷺等集資，糾工圍岸築田，這裏男女老少，大都有「不知魏晋，遑論有漢」之想。衣着盡是杜製土布，旣沒有燙髮女子，也無着皮鞋男人，粗茶淡飯，不問世事，只知日出而作，日入而息，擊壤而歌，鑿池而飲，耕田而食，終日優哉游哉，享盡田園淸福。</p>
<p>全沙房屋，僅有路留寳，路雲寳弟兄六間冷攤瓦房，其餘都是草房。所納</p>
<p>田賦甚輕　係蘆　性質，每畝不過二合米，共有一萬多畝田，價錢甚賤，每畝値五石米，田中都種植秈米，黃豆兩種，每年各有三四千石出產，其次棉花桃子　糧，亦有很冬產量，冬天的麥，蠶豆，豌豆，不耍加肥料，更是很好產量，牲畜有羊猪牛，還有一家小型機器油車，兩家土油車，婦女都能推動，往來自如，男女工作平等</p>

<h3>水菸　出口貿易佔第一位三十萬人恃以爲生</h3>
<p>〔本報蘭州廿日航訊〕甘肅水菸的馳　全國，由來已久；其鼎盛時代，遠在遜淸光緒年間及民國十年前後，不但在經濟上佔甘肅對外貿易的第一位（次爲皮毛，再次爲藥材），即在國家財政的收入，除是國稅中生要的稅源。近十年來受戰爭的摧殘，和香烟，雪茄的暢銷，以及外省仿植學製（如山西曲沃等地）的打擊，形成今天的衰落景象，但它仍有着它的銷塲，除了西北各地的平民，仍因水菸較香烟，捲烟（即土製雪茄）低廉，競相購吸外，「九一八」以前，它可遠銷到東北，烟台，平，津，晋，綏，蘇，浙，閩，粤，贛，湘，甚至南洋各地，戰後因種種關（如資本不充，交通梗阻等），銷路日蹙，究竟還可推銷到新疆，陝，川，寗，靑，豫，鄂，蘇等省，即以上年（卅五年）上海一地的銷售量，即達二，三三五，七〇五市斤，雖不可與外菸入口的數量，同日而語，其有存在的優良條件，則灼然可見。</p>
<p>水菸由菸葉炮製而成，菸葉俗名九葉芸香草，相傳諸葛亮征南蠻後</p>
<p>六出祁山　時，才將此草北傳入甘；據「金壺七墨」所載：「乾隆中蘭州時產菸種，鉛銅爲管，貯水而吸之」。所謂「管」者，即俗稱水菸袋，以廣東白銀製的最有名，貴族之家，有銀製的，貧民以竹製成，也同樣吸食。水葉烟味甘醇香潤，與香烟，雪茄大異其趣。</p>
<p>甘肅因地高，雨少，天寒等關係，菸葉的生產區域，多分佈於河流兩岸的谷地中，並以黃河流域的蘭州區和洮河流城的臨洮區爲主要產區。各地生產面積，則視往年菸葉價格及銷售情形而定，二十五年菸葉栽培面積爲四二，〇〇〇畝，收穫址三，五四六·〇〇〇市斤；卅个年因外來菸草入口不多，曾達四六，三五八畝，收穫量九，八八六，四八二市斤；以後逐年下降，上年僅有四〇，〇六五畝，收獲量爲七，〇一七，九三八市斤，上列數字，因外縣資料不易搜求，僅就菸產中心的蘭州區（包括蘭州，皋蘭，楡中，靖遠，等數縣市）而言，已足說明於業不振的趨勢，若以全省的菸產量估計，至少在八萬市斤以上，製成品當約一千一百萬市斤之譜。</p>
<p>菸葉品種　屬黃花種，一般人所稱青菸，黃菸，棉菸，僅在收穫期及製造原料的不同而已。照通常情形，春麥收割後利用空地播種，待生長到農曆霜降前拔下入倉，是謂靑葉，用以製靑菸絲；如葉被霜變黃後再砍下入倉，即謂之黃葉，用以製黃棉菸絲，其黃葉因受氣候及病虫害的影響而葉成暗黃的，都作麻菸絲和旱菸之用。菸葉品質與所含成分大右關係，通常菸葉成分，據化驗的結果：含蛋白質百分之十五至三十，灰分百分之十至二十，尼古丁百分之一至六，纎維質百分之八至十，酸類百分之二至八，阿母尼亞百分之一，水份百分之廿五至六十三。除蛋白質，纎維及水份屬中和性外，其餘如酸類，鹽基類，灰分等，都有特具的性能，吸食後可以避疫，消食，殺虫，解悶，尤以避疫爲重要功用，凡生存在崇山峻嶺，烟瘴濕地，幾有非吸於草，即將喪生的情勢。</p>
<p>水菸刨製　開始於菸葉人坊之後，其手續爲：</p>
<p>分級　將葉之主筋抽去，再按葉片的大小，色澤，厚薄，整碎情形逐一分別晒乾，此項工作俗稱撕菸葉，多臨時雇女工及童工爲之。</p>
<p>配料　將菸葉入配料房，先用沸水噴濕，再一一加入配料。靑菸和人石膏，槐花，紫花，石鹹，白礬，菜油；黃菸先將菜油噴射攪勻，然後撒入姜黃末，（染色）食鹽，（防腐）及各種香料如當歸，香草，薄荷，川芎，　朮等，也有加入名貴的冰片。　香……等，配料後拌之使勻。</p>
<p>壓捆　將配料完成的菸葉，置於特備的長方立體型槽木中，用人工赤足踏壓成毛坯的捆，再用木板夾出，切成三段，重聶置於高壓台上，用槓桿作用原理及滑車繫重方法，將菸捆予以重壓，直到結爲一個整體，能刨絲爲止，此種高壓力，通常達七十萬斤的重量。</p>
<p>刨絲　菸捆壓成後，以千市斤爲一捆，由兩人對立菸捆的兩端，四手交握特製的刨刀，往來刨切，刨出的菸絲壓入容納一兩或四兩重的硬木匣中，即成絲塊，（俗稱把）</p>
<p>風乾　刨出之菸絲塊，逐過秤後，即分別上架風乾，使菸塊中水份徐徐蒸發，期問約需一月至兩月。</p>
<p>封裝　菸塊風乾後，分組加紙妥封，分排一一裝箱。靑菸每塊重約二兩，每十塊爲一包，三百廿包爲一箱，二箱爲一担，每担約重四百四十市斤。黃菸每塊重約四兩，十塊爲一包，七十二包爲一箱，四箱爲一担，每担約重七百市斤。</p>
<p>麻菸又稱旱菸，係以製造青。黃菸時剩餘的碎末殘梗，加以少許香料製成，多銷售給勞苦階級的人吸用，其烟味辛辣激烈。</p>
<p>在民國初年，蘭州菸坊達百家以上，臨洮竟有一百五十餘；上年年底的調查，蘭州不過四十八家，而臨洮則僅餘六十七家，若以逐年减衰情形兩相比較，不啻是一部菸業衰落史；甘省僞府西北一隅，交通旣不發達，其生產與經營方法，運銷方式，又墨守舊規，更以生產成本增加，資金週轉不靈，無法改良。菸業在戰爭期間的損失，　廿七至卅三年因無法外運而霉變者，連一·一四九·八八五市斤。　廿九年圖由越南河內出口，在鎭南關附近被日機炸燬者四百箱，八萬餘市斤。　太平洋戰起，在滬被日僞沒收者一千六百餘箱，三五二·〇〇〇餘市斤，香港渝陷時，沉輪損失者六百餘箱，　三二·〇〇〇市斤；勝利後，第一次集中咸陽待東運，被渭水暴漲淹沒者七六三箱，八七·七四五市斤，上年八月九日，在碭山車站被共匪焚燬者，連一千七七百九十九箱，重二〇六·八八五市斤，此尙爲取得浪稅證明文件者。其餘直接間接的損失，尤難勝計。　甘省水菸自菸葉</p>
<p>種籽育苗　起，以至菸絲成品完成止直接間接賴以爲生的，據估計至少有三十萬人，在蘭州市一地，至少也在五萬人以上，以此重要的經濟事業，如坐　其日形衰落，以致凋蔽破產，此不能不令人猛省！更不能不急謀籌救之法！故不論中央地方政府，不論農業，金融，社會，財政，運輸等機關，均應設法協助水菸的生存，發展，推動，並恢復　甘肅僅有的經濟事業，來共謀國民經濟的光明前途。（本報通訊員宋麟）</p>

<h3>復旦合作系誔生　遵循薛仙舟先牛倡導遺規展開中國合作運動一新頁</h3>
<p>提起中國的合作運動，人們便會聯想到中國合作之父薛仙舟先生。三十年前，當合作運動的奇葩開遍世界各處的時候，中國還是合作的荒漠。到了民國八年，五四運動的民主潮流，纔冲刷着這塊古老的大陸。先知先覺的薛仙舟先生，那時爲了配合民主經濟的建立，首先在國內倡導了反帝反封建的合作運動，於是中國第一所合作銀行在上海江灣的復且大學內創立了，那就是歷史最久，辦理最成功的上海國民合作儲蓄銀行。薛先生一方而利用敎學的機會，灌輸學生們合作思想與合作知識，一方面創辦平民週刋（後改稱平民學社），鼓吹合作運動，關揚合作精神，使合作運動漸漸由知識份子向勞苦大衆展開。當時復且同學因受薛先生的感召與啓示，因而獻身於合作運動的，爲數很多；，今日國內合作界的先進如王世穎·陳仲明·溫崇信等，都曾受過薛先生的敎益。他們遵着薛先生的道路，爲中國的合作事業努力。不到一個世代的時間內，已使中國的合作運動由萌芽期演進到發展期，由都市展開到農村，爲中國的合作道路，完成了艱苦的奠基工作，這是値得敬佩的。</p>
<p>傳統精神具體表現</p>
<p>中國的合作運動，其所以誕生於復旦，除上述的薛仙舟先生的倡導外，尙有其他的歷史因素：復旦的先天，便帶有一種很强化的「互助」與「犧牲一的傳統精神；「復旦是個大家庭」，這是已故老校長李登輝博士及現任校長章益所一再强調的，而合作的原則，是人的結合，愛的連鎖，合作社如同一個大家庭，這一點正與「復旦精神」相吻合；此外，合作是一種反帝反封建的民主運動，而復旦在祖國內受軍閥割據，外遭帝國主義者的侵略下，她始終是站在戰鬥的第一錢，這就是「互助」與「犧牲」精神的具體表現。因此，復旦之所以能成爲中國合作運動的搖籃，非出於偶然，實有其先天的因素及歷史的背景。</p>
<p>在過去復旦已爲國家培植了很多卓絕的合作人才，現在她仍繼續担負起造就人才的神聖任務。去（卅六）年秋天，復且成立了合作系，這在國內各大學中還是稀有的學系。主持這系的，就是二十多年前，選在學生時代，創辦復旦平民義務學校的陳仲明先生。陳先生自從跨出復旦校門後，一直堅守着合作的崗位，多年工作的經驗，使他對於中國合作的前途抱有一種很樂觀的信念。從他那付和藹可親的能度上看去，便不難推求到當年辦理平民敎育的成功元素。</p>
<p>硏究理論配合實際</p>
<p>現在全合作系的同學共計六十六人，人數雖不算多，而他們都是經過了艱難的入學攷試後，得勝地進來的。最可貴的，是同學間感情的融洽與學習的認眞，我以外系人的　場看去。實非校內他系所能及在研究方面，他們有全系性的合作學會，經常出版學術性的壁報，讓同學們公開硏討合作問題，同時還組織了合作經濟讀書會，利用課外時間集體的讀書及討論，從最基本的去逐步探討到較高深的，從理論的配合着實際的。此外他們正在籌備成立合作圖書室，除了系中自購一部份書籍外，並請合作界的先進們捐贈，遠在四川的合作界老前輩伍玉璋先生已慷慨捐出其　書書的一部分，約近萬册，待遝來校，等到校方撥給房屋後，合作系的圖書室便可開放了。校方爲紀念合作導師薛仙舟先生，在今年的五五校友節那一天，特地命名圖書館爲「仙舟館」（見照片），使同學們面對着這偉大的建築物，頓起崇敬的思懷。</p>
<p>實地考察發掘新知</p>
<p>因爲合作是一門實用的科學，所以合作系的同學，不能專向書本搜掘，他們須要去體驗現實，去考察現狀，以作將來改進及發展的張本。因此陳仲明先生曾利用今年的暑假，分別介紹他們到南京，杭州，台灣，蘇州，及本市的各大合作社去實習，使他們從實習中去驗證書本上的知識，在實習中去了解中國合作運動的特質。在敎授陣容方面，尤使同學們滿意，除陳仲明任系主任外，還有王世穎，羅虔英，黃肇興，唐巽澤等担任敎授。羅虔英先生，是合作經濟月刋的主編，他熱忱而且勇敢，有二十多年從事合作運動的經驗，有很豐富的合作方面的著作，他希望一套完整的合作理論，一個新的合作學派能在復旦產生。在合作界久負聲譽的王世穎先生，在這裏敎高等合作經濟學，黃肇興先生授農業合作，他和陳仲明先生一樣會考察過歐洲各國的合作事業，對於農業合作有高深的研究。這些敎授和同學都很接近，因比同學們敢於無所顧忘地提出各種合作問題來討論。誠然，合作系在復旦還是初生的產兒，但合作系的師生們有一個共同的理想，就是他們都希望這孕育了三十年而今才出世不久的產兒像年輕的祖國一樣，在苦難中日漸强大起來。</p>
<p>無疑的，爲了促進民生主義的實現，合作事業在今天已肩負起國民經濟建設的重要任務，在過去復旦對於中國合作運動的成長，已有其光榮的貢獻，但幾十年來合作遝動尙未普遍展開，合作思想尙未深入民間適合國情的完整的合作理論尙未建立，因此爲伴隨歷史的　進，爲使合作運動積極地穩健地發展，根據三民主義的原則，以唯生哲學爲基礎，去建立一套實用的不朽的合作理論，應該是今後復且合作系的新使命。（葛根）</p>
<h3>寒風砭骨中藍隊勝白隊　埠際足球最後試賽藍隊以三比一得勝</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕埠際足球代表選拔賽，昨日在寒風砭骨中，舉行第三次試賽，氣溫雖在零度以下，球迷仍有三千餘人，可謂興　不淺。藍白兩隊因天寒關係，不無僵凍大失常態，上半時尤可，下半時時光近暮，氣溫益降，表演更爲平常。結果藍隊以三比一勝白隊，上半時藍隊二比零佔先。隊員表演，以勞勃司托夫張邦綸高保正等爲滿意。正式入選名單，據悉今日可以公布云。昨日試賽經過如次：</p>

<h3>小黃毛　先開紀錄</h3>
<p>全部球員，姗姗來遲，比賽至二時四十五分開始，裁判何春睴，藍隊先攻，天寒地滑，球難控制，二分鐘後，白隊反撃高秀清單騎入，惜乎功虧一簣。龍海再射，李垚角球，均未奏效。藍隊靜極思動，小黃毛與費春華聯袂進犯，金祿生亦圖建功分鐘，夏體先帶球傳中，小黃毛力射，徐福生拍出未遠，黃毛加上一記，破網而入，一比〇藍隊佔先，白隊反攻，無隙可乘，直至前半結束前五分鐘，藍隊又進攻，祿生左角切中，夏體先力射，徐福生撲空，球中門柱彈入，白隊連失兩城。二分鐘後，白隊許而茲禁區犯規，孫錦順十二碼罰而未入，前半結束，藍隊二比零領先。</p>
<h3>下半時　陣容調動</h3>
<p>休息過後，藍白陣容互有更動，藍隊勞勃司托夫，李　與白隊韓龍海，金祿生對調，嚴士鑫入塲，吳祺祥下野，李義臣右移，白隊秦必高入替徐福生，高秀淸倦勤，愛德華出任前鋒，陸炳生爲左前衛。再戰聲中白隊勞勃司托夫與愛德華搭檔，益見活躍，五分鐘時，小黃毛匹馬直搗黃龍，一對二白隊扳回一球。方擬義旗再舉，詎知藍隊龍海亦以輕騎施　，偷渡建功，成三比一。至卅四分鐘時，金祿生受傷離場。戰局已迫近終塲階段，雙方均無所獲，結果藍隊以三比一勝白隊，完成選拔最後一戰。</p>

<h3>羽球甲組賽　中華勝約翰</h3>
<p>中華昨以六比三擊敗約翰，羽球聯賽甲組錦標，將爲中華保持，蓋中華之總分，超過約翰達九分之多，約翰當有對體運一塲，約翰如以九比零全勝體運，則獲分與中華相等，但權衡實力，約翰似難有全勝九分之希望，是以錦標將屬於中華矣。昨日決賽成績如下：</p>
<p>甲組形勢</p>
<p>中華　約翰</p>

<h3>對柴油核配辦法　油脂業表示反對</h3>
<p>會最近　理柴油原料登記，規定柴油核配工廠，須憑經濟部執照，始得分配，本市油脂業各捉煉火油廠，除永大通明二廠外，餘皆不合格。該會以若千會員廠業已取得社會局工廠登記證，並正轉呈經濟辦理工廠登記，故對輸管會核配柴油辦法，提出異議，並向該會要求重行審核。</p>
<p>據稱：　關於各提煉火油廠，按工廠登記辦法向幟管會柴油分配處辦理登記事，該業認爲應根據各廠塡泠之表格，由公會彙報，俾可便於管理，藉　流弊。　關於登記合格之標準，須在經濟部登記合格，及規定經常開着一點，該業要求是項登記標準，應依據柴油及燃料油，用戶申請登記及供應辦法第五條第二項規定辦理，並准予以取得正向經濟部登記收據之廠商爲分配對象，該業公會決向輸管會據理力爭云。</p>
<h3>香港工來氣象蓬勃　申請注册工廠已近戰前數目</h3>
<p>香港航訊，本港工廠及其機械，雖然在戰時損失達百份之八十，同時面對戰後之建築材料及工資飛漲情形，香港工業在過去兩年餘中，經有長足之進展。其恢復之速，誠屬驚人。現在本港生產力，比之戰前，殆已達到百份之七十。在以後兩年內，假以現在復員之速率繼續下去，香港新舊工業之生產率，將超過戰前任何年度。</p>
<p>本港戰前工廠，幾乎均已完全或部份重建，而且有許多新工塲，或已開始生產，抑或正在發展中。戰後本港工廠之註册者，共有一，二九七家，其中一一二家，經已關閉停業。現在仍在經營中者，有一一八五家。在此數月中，八八三家經由本港勞工司接納註册，其他則尙在調查中。現下每日均有更多之申請書呈遞勞工司，請求比　註册，相信不久本港註册工廠，行將超過戰前最高記錄之一千二百家。</p>
<p>本港新工業中之最大者，厥爲紡織業。上海工業家發覺在滬工作困難，因此將廠南移來港。其次如織造及針錢業，均在進展中。日本織迭，在戰前本爲香港之勁敵，現在假如在數年間日貨仍不能抬頭，則本港織造業，前途實在未可限量，可能增加產量至百分之二百。</p>
<p>至重工業之創設，在今年內極有可能開辦銅鐵工廠·鍊銅廠·及小型之船廠。在一九四七年中，本港各船塢無不工作繁忙，並經接獲定單，足可支持工作數月而不歇者。其次新定單及囑代修理船隻者，亦正源源而來，不愁無工作可做也。在今年內，相信可能將有更多工業機構及新工業開展云。</p>
<h3>肥皂牌價掛高</h3>
<p>日用品肥皂市面，因同業抵補殷切，各方實需暢旺，更有黃祥茂廠盤，每箱提高至一百二十萬元以上之說，人心尤覺挺俏，買氣濃厚，價乃穩步上展。結果固本皂掛牌一百七十九萬元，比上日步升一萬五千元。箭刀皂升一萬，爲一百七十五萬元。黃祥茂升二萬元，此外光　亨利亦好一二萬元。</p>
<p>又訊：午收以後，場外成交雖稀，但喊價繼續上塲。固本皂高至一百八十萬元，方能買進，黃祥茂昂至一百二十六萬五千元，其他各皂，亦比場內掛牌挺秀。</p>
<h3>清償戰前存放款　一月廿七日開始</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕鋇行業戰前存款放款淸償條例，業經國府於去年十二月廿六日公布施行。本市銀錢信託三業公會，爲謀計算辦法一律起見，曾委託銀行學會，訂定「銀行業戰前存款放款劃一處理辦法」。該公會等除已呈報財政部備案，並通吿各會負一體遵行外，茲悉；該公會等爲遵照淸償條例第七條規定，已正式公吿，於本年一月廿七日，開始淸償。戰前存欠各戶，可迅向各該關係行莊公司，辦理淸償手續云。</p>
<h3>錢業小本貸款　銀團即將成立</h3>

<p>火柴交易雖不熱關喊價美麗鳳鳳南京等牌帶漲一·二十萬元，雜牌較疲，火油洋燭市仍站定。</p>
<h3>氯酸鉀等　起碼接分配廠商　輸管會在考慮中</h3>
<p>輸出入管理委員會現准設進口之「磷」「氯酸鉀」等二種化學工業原料爲火柴工業所最需之原料，以往該批原料進口後，往往由輸管會分配予進口商，再由進口商分配與該業各廠商，該業認爲如此負担過重，故要求該會以後以直接分配方式，由輸管會分配予該業各廠商。輸管會對此舉已允考慮，刻正邀集市商會及工業協會代表商討中云。</p>
<h3>川省發展特產　省府擬定三大計劃</h3>
<p>〔本報成都訊〕川省府爲發展川出口貿易，本年度特擴大特產生產運銷，其擬定計劃，　發展桐油栽培，本年完成萬縣，奉節，雲陽，巫山等縣五萬畝，並組織桐油生產合作社。　洗壓毛廠，在灌縣設洗毛厂，官商合資，用科學方法精製松潘一帶外銷之羊毛。　在隆昌設大規模之豬　廠，精煉豬鬃外銷。計劃現已通過，即付諸實施。</p>

<h3>出口困難　成本高漲　閩省茶業前途黯淡</h3>
<p>〔本報福州通訊〕向爲我國之大茶市之福州茶業市塲，近因物價波動劇烈，產製成本日高，輸出又形停滯。前此往返購銷之各地茶商，近多觀望不前，春間一片活躍景象，至此乃吿衰颯。按諸本埠行情，近日屯綠每担均在二百四十萬大關，珍眉抽心約略相等，珍眉亦在二百三十萬以上。平水綠茶减價一百六十萬，上等紅茶若崇安小種等達三百五十餘萬，中等次等亦在一百八十萬至二百四十萬邊綠。毛茶一百三十萬，炒靑一百二十萬，此類成交價格，已予茶商莫大負累。蓋以國外市塲，疲狀日增。據談：英國紅茶最高行情爲每磅四先令十便士，美國則每磅在二角三分至三角二分間，北菲綠茶則合在美金七角至一元。以當前出口價格，加上包裝運費等，每五十公斤已在三百萬以上，相形之下，茶商唯有望洋興嘆。去年八月間外匯初度調整，輸出額月達萬餘担，九月份减爲半數，十月份則僅餘四千餘担，至若十一月以後，則更無起色矣。</p>

<h3>放射性同位素研究的新進展</h3>
<p>— 楊實</p>
<p>無論在科學硏究上或醫療上，放射性同位素（Radiol　otopes）都是極得力的工具，但直划不久以前，要獲得牠們，得付出很高的代價，從迴旋衝　器（Cyclotron）產生內數量之少，令人短氣，而花費也就可觀了。把價値五十個美金的　放射性碳鑛，引入迴　衝　器內，再費一百萬美金，才能得出一點放射性同位素來。現在新方法已發明出來，人工　　放射性同位索，已可大量出產，橡嶺（Oakricge）的原子試驗室巳可用鏈式分裂作用，從鈾堆垜（Uramium　Pile)中獲得外行人所謂的「人造鐳」（Artificial　ra　ium)，牠不但無限制的供給每個高深試驗室應用和醫院作「　　」，而且也可當產　，　高價出口到世界各國，這在放射性同位素的研究上，實在是邁進了一大步。</p>
<p>在醫療上，放射性同位素的射綫可以治病是有奇效的，無論射到靜脈或者某種器官內，甚至置於無味的溶液讓病人一口吞下；這些類似鐳的元素都可極準確到　傷處，擊潰病菌，使傷害痊　。自從顯微鏡發明後，牠們在　學硏究上又是一個得力的工具，牠可以充作生理學家的「偵探一，滲合在某些食物中進入人體後，可以顯現出那些科學家欲知的生理反應；在工程上，特別化學分析上，牠是不可少的工其。</p>
<p>像嶺的大量生產是由鈿分裂　的中子去衝擊堆垜而產生許多　放射性同位素，在六十多稱元　　，即可有九十種同位素產出。而在耶魯大學物理試驗室的二七英吋直徑大的迴旋衝擊器也　以產出許多壽命非常短促的同　　來。</p>
<p>美國物理硏究中心之一的耶　大學物理試驗室，已在大規模　從事這稱人工造鐳的新方法的試驗，每天有無數的飛機和火車爲這個試臉室運來鑛料。領導這十個偉大的硏究工作的便是原子核物理學的先軀波拉德博士（Dr．Ermest　Pollard）。現在我　可以分別把這些射性同位素　學術硏究上的帮助介紹一下。</p>
<p>燐在自然界中，如憐石是有人量的存在的，造成的放射性燐，可以製成防止痢疾菌活動的痘　，注射動物體內。譬如把牠參　在滋養料中注射到體內，再用　氏計算器可以非常準確的檢査　傷害的所在，假便注射到鷄蛋　，放射性燐又成了個培菌器（Germ　incubators）使蛋內生出流行性感冒菌。如注射到花粉裏，就會發生突變（Mutation)。</p>
<p>由於碘和甲狀腺有着高度的　　力，使放射性碘可作治療甲狀腺的利器。當毒瘤素從甲狀腺　移到人體的某一部份，一劑放射性碘和一架盆氏計算器立即可　査出毒害的地方，同時再加强碘的數量去擊破毒菌使其永遠毀　；因之，這樣放射碘不知要拯　多少人呢。</p>
<p>放射性錳也替許多動物學家　　了不少困難問題，如黃蜂和蛤在動物分類上是沒有一點親緣　係，但牠們倆的體內比其他動物　多含四十倍多的錳，這是爲什麼？原來那就是放射性錳。</p>
<p>有許多放射性同位素的生命之短，令人吃驚，就利用這種微　關係，對原子核的研究是有極大帮助的，美國海軍硏究局就由於牠的重要，已資助波拉德博士繼續作新的探討。他曾發明了一座「慢鐘」，專用來測定這些放射性同位素的壽命，從廻旋衡擊器產出的放射性氖，經一個電磁透鏡去測定射綫　能量，就斷定牠的壽命僅有四十秒。放射性　也不過有兩個鐘頭的生命而已。</p>
<p>從一九○六年耶魯大學的包特武德敎授（Prlf．Bertram　BBoltwlld）發現第一個同位素（lonium　的同位素，較　略輕）到現在，科學家已先後發現六百七十多種同位素，就中有二百七十多種是固定性的，如像甫水中的重氣（較氣重一倍）外，十種在普通鑛中能找出的錫的同位素，其餘都是放射性同位索，牠們的壽命有短到一百萬分之一秒，長也到幾乎千萬年以上。大部份由人工造出的，如前所述，產量之少，使科學家明知道是一個對於研究極有帮助的工具，而無法獲得多量，以進行工作。現在可以大量產出了，牠們給科學硏究者帶來的，無疑的將是一串神速的進展。</p>
<h3>食米代用品</h3>
<p>— 克志</p>
<p>這次世界大戰結束後，造成全世界都在鬧饑荒。據說幾年以米，歐洲一般人的食物中都缺少蛋白質，以致體力袞弱，助長了疾病的流行。我國自從戰事結束後，因爲天災人禍全國各地都鬧饑荒。這成脅到現在還沒有解除，陷於饑餓中的人誠然不知多少，這情形眞够慘重啊！</p>
<p>化學家在營義上認爲不可缺少的是蛋白質，脂肪，碳水化合物，礦物質和水等幾種營養素，近來又注意到維他命的問題。所以現在在營義上認爲最重要的，大槪是蛋白質，礦物質，熱量以及維他命。因爲假如這些營養要素缺少的話，則不够供給人體生活所必需之能量，自然身體要生毛病了。這些營養要素靠什麼東西來供給呢？我們吃的食物就是來供給這些要素的，蔬菜是比較價廉的，但是其他像肉類，牛奶等在戰後物資缺乏的時期，常然不能充分供給，所以一般人的營養都缺乏。化學家又想了一個方法，用低康酌物品，來供給人體營義上的需要，因此用了富於蛋白質的大豆做材料，做成一種强有力的蛋白質食品，奇怪的，吃了這種食品，其效用竟和吃其他的食品相仿，足够人體營養的需要。原來大豆中所含的礦物質，比麵粉中所含的要超過十至十五倍，主要的維他命要超過五至十倍，蛋白質亦達四倍之多，而且大豆中的蛋白質與牛肉中所含的品質相仿。大豆中因爲含有這許多的營義素，所以營養化學家又把它製成大豆粉，使更成爲易於携帶　持久保存的東西。</p>
<p>大家都知道，全世界大豆的產量以我國爲最多，可是在幾千年來的我國，大豆並不被人重視，大家祇當作一種普通的　糧，誰知道經過化學家的改造以後，竟變成極重要的營義品，可是在產量最多的東北現正缺糧，何不多多採用大豆，代　米麵，也是解决糧荒的一法，人民反把牠常作燃料，眞是可惜之至。</p>
<p>事情更奇妙的，還有一種營養成完全的食品，也在一位科學家的努力下製成了。原來美國陸軍部和聯十總有一個食品顧問名呌克靈頓（C．E．Clinton）的，鑒於戰後議荒益　重，就請加州理工大學的科學家硏究，想法子解救　荒問題。結果有一位波叔（Bor．ook）博士接受了這個任務，可是這位博士不在試驗室來做實驗，反在他的廚房裏想法子，因此他只用了廚房裏的鍋子做器皿，沒有用到試驗管等化學儀器，並且他還雇了一位法國的名廚做助手呢。科學家的本領　　，經過一年多的硏究工夫，　　　明了一種營養成分完全的東西，簡稱爲MPM。看起來這似乎並不是一種什麼了不得的東西，其主要成分不過是油分很低而蛋白質含量較多的豆片，另外加人脫水的甘薯，靑菜，番茄，洋葱和香料等，外面再用鈣質和維他命A．B．C．包被。但是吃起來，色味俱臻上乘，不論男女老少都很歡迎。這東西的營養價値如何呢？據說只要用乾量的二兩多點，就可供我們大嚼一頓，這東西又用以供應美國加州的幾百所學校採用，頗爲師生所歡迎；後來聯合國大會在舊金山開會，又拿牠來供應各國代表，也沒有一個人不大加贊賞的。</p>
<p>這東西自經各方面一致獎贊以後，不但因爲價廉物美，而且因爲是一種乾燥製品，更易於運送。所以不但風行美國國內，而且也大量的輸出。據說美國每月能够製成一千萬磅，運往歐洲各地，以每磅供七入一餐膳食計算，全部可供給七千餘萬人的膳食，那時歐洲正鬧饑荒，這東西剛巧到歐洲去救了許多餓殍。我國現在不是正有許多難民嗎？所以也希望牠早些光臨我國，好敎嗷嗷待哺的饑民，也能嘗嘗滋味，但是現在聯總在我國的機構已經撤消了，幸而這位發明這件食品的波博十，沒有把牠取得專利權，所以希望這稱食品的配方和製造方法，早日讓我們）知道，就可以自己來製造這種食品，難民們也就可以解决饑　的問題了。</p>

<h3>冰造大厦</h3>
<p>— 白石</p>
<p>在二次大戰期間，英國人曾擬在大西洋中央建築一個巨大的，浮在海面上的「冰島」——名呌「哈巴庫克」——以供軍用飛機降落洛和加油之用。主持這革命性計劃的著名科學家，是奇奥弗雷，派克博士（Dr．Geoffrey　Pyke）然而在他這計劃實現以前，大戰就結束了，却已收集了不少很有價值的關於冰的性質的資料。</p>
<p>派克博士眼見了一塊的冰是很容易「鎔接一的；如果加一些纖維質在其中，就可增强其鞏固的程度。爲要達到這目的，住在冰天雪地中的愛斯基歷人，一向是用靑苔的；那些英國的工程師却用了木漿，所得的結果更其好得多。最理想的混合物，是百分之八十六的冰和百分之十四的木　——這種新的建築材料就稱爲一派克利德」（Pykrete），以紀念它的發明者。在它凍結成塊以後，這種材料可像木頭或「人造可塑物」（如「不碎玻璃」，「電木」等）那樣易於處理，可以鋸成種種形狀，且非常堅固耐用。自然，在溫度不是一直在點以下的地方，必須用人工的保冷法來保牢那些冰塊的——這，手被也並不怎樣困難，　像在建築巨大的隱　而材料尙未凝固時用以防止各部分漲縮不勻的方法。</p>
<p>在溫帶地方，有了適當的保冷法，這種木漿和冰的混合物，因爲輕而堅强，或可用以建造臨時性質的房屋·高塔等等不能用重實的鋼骨水泥來建築的東西。在北極圈內，木頭和磚頭的建築物，在解凍時期常要崩潰或走樣，這種冰部可以代替它們，作爲一種廉價而可滿意的建築材料。當我們着手去開發「南極地帶」蘊藏着的大量煤和黃金等天然資源時，用這種「木漿冰」來建造房屋等等，顯然是最便宜，且最方便的方法。自然，這些建築物不需要用人工來保冷，而那邊的勁風却可利用來發電，以溫暖其內部。未來的南極的都市，可能是一大堆璀燦發閃的住宅·工廠·辦事處·學校·以及公路——全是用冰造成的！</p>
<h3>電子顯微鏡</h3>
<p>— 明玉</p>
<p>焦點上有方螢光板，電子流在中途經過標本，而將影像投射到螢光板上面，因而人們的眼睛便可以在板上見到頗大的影像了。這樣的影像廣有三吋半。然而此鏡的一個缺點，是電子流對於生物的致命打擊。在普通顯微鏡下面，我們所見到的，是活動的，有生命的東西；可是在電子顯微鏡下面則不然，所見到的是靜止的，弄死了的東西。如果我們取去螢光板而代以乾片，便可以攝成一張照相，以供不時觀察之用。然而這又不使說是「照相一因爲並未用到「光子」（Photons）之故，所以有班枸謹的科學家特造了一個名詞稱之曰「電子顯微相一（Electron　Micrographs)</p>
<p>首次與世人相見的一張電子照相，是一件淺薄的作品，在一道强力的陰極光之下，乾片上留下了一張鈔票的陰影，這是十七年以前的往事。</p>
<p>從這張照相以至今日所攝成的那些「毒素」顯微相片，這其間，不能不說是一絕大進步了。這種毒素必到無可再小，有的是活動的有機體，有的僅是一種化學上的分子，今日的科學家正憑藉了這些顯微照相而加以說明。總之，這些素歷來所造成了流行性感目，傷風，天花，小兒麻瘴症以及其他的病症，或許病症也因此而生。我們行將看到這一些毒素的眞面自，使醫學上的罪犯照像册本添了許多材料。</p>
<p>維他命與酵素的眞形像也將被攝取了。這些物質是必到以前用任何方法也不能窺到的。一俟有許多的電子顯微鏡可供利用，在我們四周與在我們體內的那些普通物質所呈現的奇觀，將不知道有多少。</p>
<p>這電子顯微鏡再有一個可能性：即由此我們或許可以進而窺到物質內的分子型，這是科學家所最感到興奮的。此舉雖在目前因超顯微鏡在構造上，還不免有缺憾，然而自原理上說來，一定是可以辦得到的。只要像它今日所能攝得到的物體，再小一百倍，它也能窺到，那就能用以窺察分子了。對於分子的構造圖樣，正有不少人用着畢生的精力和鉅萬的金錢，想從此學的途徑來解決它。</p>
<p>化學家以腦代目向來都像一些聰明的盲人，假使他們一旦果能見到各種物質內部的分子，是如何排列的，則有機化學上必將有一種驚人的進展，這是無待贅言的了。這一門化學，以前已經給我們造成了「尼隆」，人造絲，合成樹膠，樹膠硫黃等——完全是一種新工業。</p>
<p>爲什麼有這樣一種可能呢？我們的解釋是這樣的：原來物體小到怎樣程度而仍能爲我們所窺到，那要看我們在窺視時所用的光波的長度而定。換言之，波長愈短，便愈能映出更小的部分。</p>
<p>電子流的波長須視電子進行的速度而定，而進行的速率則有賴於督促它們的電位差。今日電子顯微鏡所使用的電壓，係自一萬伏脫以至九萬伏脫，其所生之波長，短至五十埃（Amgstrom），（一埃等於一緾之一千萬分之一），此即相當於現在所能窺見的物件之大小了。</p>
<p>如電壓達一百萬伏脫之時，則可以促進電子流的速度到每秒鐘一七五·〇〇〇哩而有餘，波長約爲一埃的百分之一。在一個含有炭原子與輕原子的分子中，原子間的距離，約爲二埃。我們要造或一個一百萬伏脫的電壓，並非難事，科學家所要攝取分子型的一舉，將大有可能。</p>
<p>這一個理論，暗示了科學家了今後所努力的目標。過去，對於無限小所遭遇的艱難辛苦，正在鼓勵他們向前邁進。一件探險工作的新紀元，目前已經開始了。（續完）</p>
<h3>工業地下化</h3>
<p>— 鄭佐卿</p>
<p>第二次世界大戰中，對於飛機生產工業防止空襲最有效之方法，首推生產機構之全部地下化，美國陸上空軍補給司令部最近硏究德國地下工業之結論，深信上言爲不　。</p>
<p>歷史上第一個地下工廠，當推一九一七年德國Thuringia地方的Mulhausen山洞中所建立的精密儀器製造廠，一九四三年，德國V？號轟炸火箭製造廠亦行遷入地下，翌年希特勒命令一切飛機生產機稱全部均須移入地下，可惜常時戰局江河日下，未有充分時間足以實行全部地下化計</p>
<p>德國常時採用兩種地下化之建築：一爲部分地下化，用以抵禦最慘烈之地氈轟炸（CarpetBombing）；另一爲全部地下化，前者大都採用「潛水艦」結構形式，係由强力鋼筋混凝土製成圓頂，圍以巨牆厚蓋。部分地下結構之另一形式爲「煤倉」式外形大致與「潘水艇」結構相倣，此等結構大槪八十呎高，內分四　至六層，共計平面一百二十萬方呎，其中百分之四十之平面，深入地下，雖然「煤倉式」結構未及全部完成供用，但此種設計，似爲德國最適宜之半地下結構，　其容有大量平面可供利用，且高度適宜，進出便利，一切防禦設備，亦頗有效。</p>
<p>科學漫談</p>
<h3>膠體</h3>
<p>— 瞿友仃</p>
<p>物質通常可分液體·固體·氣體三態，但除此之外，尙有一種膠體（Colloids）。此乃某些物質如硫·普魯士藍·甚至純金等懸混於液體物中所成，此種物質之懸粒微小得甚至用最高度的　徵鏡亦不可見，但却不溶解於液體中；此現象　先在約百年以前由沙米（Semi）柏志留（Berzlius）　斗勒得（Faracay）等三人所發現。不數年英人格蘭模（Thomas　Graam）發現眞正溶解後之物質皆可自由穿過羊皮紙或動物膜，但如骨膠，動物膠等奇異液體則不如是；爲與前述懸膠物（Collo　ial　Supemsion）相區別起見，他呌它們作溶膠（Sol）。之後經許多人　硏究，得知這些所謂膠者，並非物質之另一體態。這不是物質種類的問題，而是質點大小的問題，這種膠性質點，其　大奢亦不能用通常之顯微鏡觀察見之。</p>
<p>在適當之條件下，可　將任何物質均造成溶膠狀；作法有數種，其質點可由原子，分子或離子之反應而建造或集中，或將較大之質點粉碎分離而得。例如將濃逯化氯溶液加入沸水中，即可得氫氧化鐵（Fe（OH）3）之膠體質點；此種小質點係由氯化鐵（FeCL3）迅速受水解後分離而成，可懸游經年而不墜。此種膠體之顏色爲深棕色。但傾加氣化鐵溶液時不可過速，否則將得氧化鐵而非　　化鐵。當氯化鐵水解時，同時並有氯氫酸產生，遺留於膠質　；如欲除之則必用格關模氏之　名分離法，即透膜分析（Dialysis）;如用一毛細孔濾過膜及一動物膜時，則雖氯氫酸及膠質均可透過濾過膜，但當酸液透過動物膜時，膠質即被擋回（氫氧化鐵質點不能通遜）。格氏所用者爲豬尿囊與羊皮紙，而現在所用膠性膜及浸水機維則更有效；法將膜片剪成直徑八吋至十一吋之圓形，然後作成一漏斗狀，緊紮下端，形成一袋，將膠液灌入，滿一半爲止，再將袋置入一水盆中，數分鐘後，將藍色試紙放入水中，即見由藍變紅，是即表示水已變成酸性。</p>
<p>濬膠等何以呈懸游狀態呢？其原因有二：一是由於支持液體之分千之運勸，前後撞擊膠質之點，反抗地心吸力；一是膠質之點各負電荷，互相排斥。後者可由下述實驗知之：法將一四十五伏或九十伏之電池之兩極繫兩碳棒，分別置入一盛有普魯士藍膠液之Ｖ形管之兩端。因此種膠質之點係負負電荷者，故均被負極所斥而被正極所引；數分鐘後即可見藍色物由負極紛紛移向正極。如係氧氣化鐵膠質時，因其質點負正電荷，故情形相反，而並不太顯著，且當其集於負極後，即有下　現象。</p>
<p>由此我們可以想見，若兩種相反電荷之膠質質點適量混合時，則其質子將相互吸引，以致電荷中和，質點常不能再度懸游；故當普魯士藍與氧氣化　膠質之點相混時，則見較大之質點下墜　容器之底。如加充分之酸扑鹼等人荷電膠質中，亦可使其中和失荷而釀成墜落；此即城市中常加硫酸鋁或硫酸鐵入泥水中以淸潔飲水之原。理</p>
<p>有一種將大型質點破壞而成膠質質點的方法，名曰Peptization此法可由下例知之：在一濾水器上塗以濃厚之普魯士藍澱，將草酸(Oxalicacid，C2H2O4)色立即開始侵入濾水器之細孔由；如設法將草酸除去，則所遺留之藍即成膠狀。按此種膠狀普魯士藍爲寫　墨水之原料，且普遍用作染料。</p>
<p>又膠狀　點常可由下法產生：另一溶液稀釋一含某種固體之溶液。惟用作稀釋之溶液需爲不能溶解該同體者。例如將硫質之酒精溶液傾入水中，即可得乳狀硫質溶膠是也。使虫膠（Shellac）之變白乃另一例，因水稀釋溶解虫膠脂之酒精故也；虫膠脂不溶於水，遂成膠質之點沉澱於水，因其有散光性質，故呈白色。</p>
<h3>鹼——不可一日無此君</h3>
<p>— 王乾德</p>
<p>人類生存在世界上不能一大脫離了水的供給，這是一件極普通而人人都知道的事，但是同樣的人類生存在世界上也不能一天沒有鹼；這恐怕大家會奇怪，或許會嘲笑吧！請把下面的事實了解淸楚，也就可把疑惑轉變爲信任。</p>
<p>「鹼」這是一個總括的名稱，其實要把它仔細的分起來，却可分爲三種：純鹼（蘇打）Sodium　Carbonate，燒鹼（苛性蘇打）Sodium　Hydroxide，焙用鹼（小蘇打Ssdium　Bicarbonate，現在就依照上面的次序，把它們的主要用途分別的來談一談：</p>
<p>純鹼——在城市裏比較新式的房屋和建築，有幾閂玻璃窗，並不算希奇的事，但那窗玻璃的主要原料就是純鹼。</p>
<p>凡是曾在鄉村裏住過的人，一定看到過，或聽到過，那些鄉下的婦女們，常把草灰當作洗　劑，拿汚穢的衣服在草灰裏擦洗，經過洗滌以後的衣服，確實很淸潔了，道是什麼綠故呢？因爲草灰裏有純鹼的成分，而純鹼有去汚的能力。</p>
<p>更重要的就是假使沒有純鹼，恐怕到今天在大海洋裏還不能有來往的輪船，而沿海的都市全還是窮鄕僻壤，不能有現代化的工業，因爲海水裏含有鎂，鈣，鋁等的礦物質，凡是含有這種礦物質的水都稱爲「硬水」（Hard　Water），它對於工廠的鍋爐，和輪船的心臟——汽鍋——是絕對不相宜的，而且日久以後，還會造成爆炸的災禍。所以凡是沿海區的工廠或海洋中行駛的輪船，它們所用的水必須先經「純鹼」及石灰的軟化，才能使用無　。</p>
<p>其他像紡織工業，製泡碱，以及製牙粉等莫不和　鹼有關。</p>
<p>燒鹼——肥皂是一種家常用品，不句一日或缺的洗　劑，任何人都有　會用到肥皂，不論是藥水皂，香皂，洗衣皂歸根結底的說一句，它的主要原料總逃不脫燒鹼。</p>
<p>再說，假使沒有　鹼的話，那裏來的現在這樣者究的什麼道林紙，白報紙，恐怕還只是極　　的竹紙吧！因爲製造紙漿的第一部，須將原料腐燒成糾粹的　維，「燒鹼」就是一種極强烈的腐蝕劑。</p>
<p>絲光襪，絲光布，在現代的都市裏是相當流行的，但是知道它原料的恐怕只是極少數人，談到絲光布與絲光襪，我們應當要紀念麥塞（Mercer）——絲光布的首創者——和感謝燒鹼；有許多人以爲絲光布是夾絲夾棉而織成的，其實完全錯了，所謂絲光布只是將棉紗經過燒鹼液的處理，使直的棉纖維，變爲螺旋狀，由螺旋狀　維所織成的棉布，受了光綫反射的作用，而發出絲光，成了風行的絲光布。冉說，就是天然絲的勁敵——螺縈（Rayon）——不過是燒鹼處理廢料後</p>
<p>還有調味用的味精，也只是以燒鹼爲原料的製品。</p>
<p>培用鹼——在夏天酷熱的天氣裏，冷飲是解渴解熱的聖品，汽水是冷飲的一種，汽水爲什麼會有氣呢？這是因爲在汽水裏壓入了二氧化碳氣體。二氧化碳氣體當壓力一放鬆時就會產生氣泡，所以有時當汽水瓶蓋開啓時，甚至汽冰都會噴出，但是要知道小蘇打是一種製二氧化碳最好的原料。</p>
<p>幾年前小蘇打是一種治胃病的良藥，但是現在已漸漸的落伍了。</p>
<p>假使你常吃麵包，大餅或油條的話，那發酵的酵母，就是由小蘇打製成的。</p>
<p>一些在牆上的紅色滅火器，也是由小蘇打的溶液和硫酸而造成的。</p>
<p>人類生存在地球上能不洗衣嗎？能不用肥皂嗎？能不用紙嗎？假使你的回答是「不能」，那就得承認鹼的重要了。</p>

<h3>六十道菜</h3>
<p>— 何苦</p>
<p>克利扶蘭總統號郵船到了上海，着實使上海的　錢風迷了一陣，報紙上久已看不到這樣代表着承平的花邊新聞，便是我們從紙而上來欣賞這條郵船的豪華，已够滿足了</p>
<p>船上的　　，單就吃的一項來說，即足令人咋舌。一客大菜有六十幾道，山珍海味，任憑你去選擇。假如是一個量大的　餮之徒，只要你吃得下，便是六十道菜照單全收，並不要你另加附加費之類。中國人俗語所謂「開了飯店，不怕大肚皮」，克利扶蘭號倒眞正地實踐了。但是我敢斷言，胃口再好一點的人決不會能吃盡此六十道大菜：這就是說，船公司儘管慷慨，而旅客的享受是有飽和點的，正如「宇宙之歲月無窮，而人生之壽算有限」一樣。</p>
<p>因此我覺得對於克利扶蘭是沒有什麼可羨之處。因爲她只供給了五百幾十個旅客以一份豐盛的食物，而無法使全部需要食物的人以一份果腹的乾糧。孟子曾經考問過齊王，「獨樂樂，與衆樂樂，孰樂」？結論就是「不若與衆一！如其拿克利扶蘭與世界比較，正是「獨樂樂」和「與衆樂樂」的分野。絛管她有六十道一客的大菜，其奈胃腸之間的悄化力量，只有二道三道何？</p>
<p>當全世界人大部份只能擠電車，侷促在小火輪的時代，一艘克利扶蘭，只是天堂裏的瑞芝靈草，與地面的凡卉絕無干係。至於地面上可以不可以長出瑞芝靈草呢？我的答覆是肯定的，但還得凡卉之自已努力！</p>
<h3>談玩火</h3>
<p>— 一峯</p>
<p>希腦神話如此說：人世間本來是沒有火的，自從普羅米修士將它從天國偸給人間以後，這人世間纔開始有了發光發熱而烈熖可愛的火。因此，也引起上帝大大的惱怒，便把他用鎖鋉困在一個峯嶺上，讓鷹鷹來啄他的肺臟，作爲一種對他偸火的懲罰。這雖然是一則神詁，但上帝爲什麼要這樣的吝嗇他的火，而不肯將其給與人類呢？我想大概當他創造人類的時候，就平已預料到人類的野心難訓；一旦有了火，就更不得了，這世界也就會因給野心的人玩火的緣故，而使末日降臨吧？否則，偸火給人的普羅米修士，何致得到如此嚴厲底懲罰呢？</p>
<p>事實也確是如此，這世間自從有了火種以後，便繼續不斷地產生了許多的玩火者，這班玩火　，都是威福自恣，野心勃勃的　土，他們運用火作了殺人的利器，征服異已，屠殺善良，使人類遭受空前的厄運，難免要大批的死亡。代人類受過而好心地將火偸給人間的普羅米修士聞之，也，定會後悔罷？</p>
<p>是，「玩火者常毀於火」，俗語也說，惹火燒身一，這又似乎是上帝故意給一班野心家的　　。然而，事實却悲哀得很，　玩火而毀於火」的野心家偏是層出不窮，一前車之鑒」的效力，竟是微之又微呢！</p>
<p>不是麼？威簾之後不廿年，馬上就有了希特勒。此公好不威風！在第二世界大戰之初，一把火燬了波蘭，又一把火燬了法蘭四，二個月里席捲了歐洲大陸，　不愧古往今來玩火羣中的健者　可是也終於逃不出「惹火燒火」的定律，好景不常，一挫於莫斯　的大風雪，再挫於山姆叔的機羣，最後也只得「自焚」於柏林的總統府了事。日寇也是如此，從「九一八」一把火起到「三八」一把火止，在東方着實得意了十年；可是，以其人之道，還其人之身，原子彈的空前大火，終致在一九四五年八月燒上了大門，不得不宣吿屈膝！</p>
<p>今天，第二次的戰火雖已熄滅二年餘了，然而新的玩火正在急起直迫與「死灰復燃」之山，「强權」政治絲毫沒有改變它的面目。假如第三次大戰無可避免的話，那麼，那野火是會燒得更熾更烈，人類的厄運也就愈深愈苦了。看看世界各地已有烽火漫天之勢，不禁爲那些放火的人們躭心！</p>
<h3>掃除文盲</h3>
<p>— 方仁</p>
<p>一般說來，上海是一個文化發達的地方，以與閉塞的內地比較起來，不可同日而語。但據本報日前發表民政局的統計：四百四十九萬四千二百九十市民中，文盲竟達一百八十八萬五千五百六十九人之多，佔總人口數約爲百分之四十二。</p>
<p>我國掃除文盲的工作，自北伐以來，自始即加注意，目前也何嘗不在積極進行；但國人有一種通病，就是抱定各人自掃門前雪，莫管他家瓦上霜的主意。掃除文盲的工作，以學校而論，除了所謂民衆學校以外，其他學校也就從不聞問，像本市現有一百四十餘所民衆學校，因爲本身並無校舍，祗好向私立中小學商借，其間就發生了不少的週折。</p>
<p>其實，中國是一個貧窮的國家，若要掃除文盲，也只能採取極經濟的辦法；不要說現有的敎育機構，晚上有空的敎室，固然應該充分的利用，即如戲院，舞塲，或遊藝場，在白天或上午有空時，也何嘗不可以作爲推行社會敎育的塲所？掃除文盲的課室？這是空間有了着落；爲能輔以巡迴敎育的設施，則更可免文盲的途中跋涉，一定更見有效。至于人員方面，可以征用一部分智識分子來協助，也並非過分之舉。所以掃除文盲並不是能不能的事，而是做不做的事。</p>
<p>記得在聯合國文敎會席上曾將我國列入黑暗地帶，這是何等的恥辱！我們應以「中國無文盲」自期；否則，國家的建設與國家的地位，是永遠是沒有辦法的。</p>

<p>此外，大學圖書館本身，計分成七十五組每組等於一個專用圖書館。其中藏書最多者，如法卷，醫藥組藏書二十八萬卷；工商管理組，一稱貝克圖書館，藏杜佛哈佛岡書館，藏書十九萬三千卷；公共行政組，一稱律道埃學博物完藏書十九萬八千卷；哈佛燕京學院中日圖書之部藏書十八萬五千卷，生物學實驗館藏書七萬三千卷；天文台藏書三萬七卷，正是琳瑯滿目，無價　寶，以上各組圖書館均編有總目錄，並有電話設備，及雇用差役，遞送訊息，以保持密切的聯繫。</p>
<p>哈佛大學每年增加的卷帙，平均在十一萬三千卷之譜。該館擁有各界捐助的基金，達美金三百七十萬元以上，所得的進益，專供添購圖書及館中開支之用。</p>
<p>又該館的珍本書，約有二千六百餘卷，係在一千五百〇一年前出版。著名詩人濟慈的作品及手跡，兔集尤多，特在霍甫登大樓內，闢有　室儲藏。其他自喬叟以下的英國作家，及當代諸大文豪，如曼殊斐爾·喬埃斯·艾里奥特·羅濱牛·史坦柏克諸氏的稿本，莫不搜羅齊全。</p>
<p>自然，哈佛大學圖書館內，更集有不少妙書，似不在大學敎育的硏究範圍之內，例如棋諩，食譜，釣魚經，　語集等，其中一部份係由外界捐贈的。</p>
<p>裏，尙須補記的是：該館有關戲劇的藏書特多，在韋特納大樓中分佔數大間，內有戲報紙招及說明書一百萬份以上，男女藝員照片凡二十六萬張，堪與「以蒐集早期英國舞合史料著稱」的華盛頓福爾格圓書館，及專門搜羅現代劇交　的紐約公立圖書館，嚴　足而三。</p>
<p>最後，該館「詩室」內，集有當代各大詩家的傑作。韋特納大樓中地圖之部，以收藏古代地圖爲主，至於現代地圖，則另歸地理探險學院的分組圖書館管理。</p>

<h3>海登和他的創世記</h3>
<p>— 洛德</p>
<p>本月二十五日和下月一日在蘭心戲院將有一個盛大的聖樂會，是有三十年歷史的雅學社和有六十年歷史的交響樂團。勝利後的第一次合作大奏唱，指揮富華敎授。這使我們回憶起戰前梅百器大師指揮這二個樂隊時的盛境來，撫今追昔，有些時還年靑的隊員，現在已兩鬢斑白了！</p>
<p>節目是約瑟，海登的神曲「創世記」。</p>
<p>被尊爲「奏鳴曲之父」，一交響曲之父」的海登也是一位偉大的神曲作家。他生於一七三二年維也納附近的一個寒村，父親是個車匠。而他却自幼就是音樂天才，八歲入敎會爲歌童，並受音樂敎育。九年後因値變聲期被免職，以後生活困苦，惟仍努力硏究作曲，整日的讀着奏鳴曲家巴赫的作品。一七六〇年後在愛好音樂的貴族厄斯特哈齊兄弟家中任樂長，凡三十年之久，大部份的作品都成於此，被稱爲巴赫的繼承人。一七九〇年，去倫放旅行演奏，爲韓德爾神曲所感，二度觀光時得「創世記」劇本，目一七九五年至九八年完成他的大神曲「創世記」。</p>
<p>「創世記」不但表現出作者高尙的品性，而且是集樂曲優點的大成，純樸雄偉，深邃的詩意透入形意二界。而風格的優異，流露着造物主的超凡神秘，眞可說包羅萬象，蘊涵無遣，如他所寫渾沌的展露，冥魅的遁奔，朝曙的初現，宇宙的變遷，造化的美和藝術的眞相融匯，眞是一部價値不朽的大作品。</p>
<p>作品共分爲三段二十四節。弦樂「洪荒渾沌」代前奏曲，在神曲的作風上爲首創。曲中人物有天使蓋必，由麗，雷飛和亞當，夏娃。</p>
<p>該作成於一七九八年四月二十九日，次日試演於史華城堡王宮，一七九九年三月十九日公演於皇家劇院，聽衆俱受很大的感動。當時這位老音樂家說：「余哭感寒冷如冰，俄而又炎熱如火焚。」晚年並說：「余每日作「創世記」前，呼籲上帝，賜予能力，生平從未若此虔敬。」</p>
<p>海登在其他作品方面有交響曲「百二十篇，其中如有名的「告別交響曲」，是早期作於厄斯特哈齊家中，爲了一批即將被解散的音樂隊而作的離別曲，在演奏時一個個樂師絡續吹熄了自己面前的燈燭，帶着樂器默然退出，最後祗剩下一個提琴家和他氣氛非常凄凉。但同時我們也能在他的作品中見出他的諧謔，如在驚愕交響曲幽靜的第二樂章中，突然的襲來了一陣强音的鼓聲，使貪睡的聽者驚覺，又是如何的幽默啊！</p>
<p>也因此在他耆年時才有羽化登仙的「創世記」產生。他逝世於一八〇九年，在維也納。</p>
<h3>捫心頌</h3>
<p>— 康民</p>
<p>敬愛善人和厭恨惡人是通常十的人情，而一百個世人中至少有九十九個把自已歸在善人項下，就算有一個反省到自己不能稱爲善人，但我相信他仍是竭力想做好人，更希望別人能譽他是好人的；眞的，世上決沒有生成的惡人，也決沒有存心奸邪的；一切作惡犯法的人們都有原諒自己的理由和立塲。</p>
<p>然而，人們眞的都是善人嗎？聖賢尙且有過失。捫心自問，誰無疚心的事？司馬　公自言生平所爲，未嘗有不可對人言者，這句話恐怕也不脫史家渲染的作風。</p>
<p>我國不富强，原因雖多，但歸納起來祇一句話：國民道德低落而已。這是敎育問題，敎育問題決不能在短短數年內解決，而目前搶救國民道德繼續的低落，我認爲是刻不容緩的了，要急就章而能生効的，祇有「們心」一法；我深切希望每一個人每一天作一次捫心反省。</p>
<p>特別是那些不合作，不負責，不生產？耗損公物，鑽營私利，投機取巧，怠惰，迷醉，頹廢的人們，我祈求他們捫心自問：活着究竟是爲的什麼？良心上有沒有片刻的安寗？</p>
<p>我够不上資格敎訓那些高貴豪富的「良心犯」，他們也無需我敎訓。因爲每一個人有一顆鮮紅的善良的心。我已經說過：敬愛善人和厭恨惡人是通常的人情，而且每一個人都喜歡別人稱譽他是好人；所以祇要他們有機會靜下來捫心一想，什麼都有辦法</p>
<p>幷不是說經過一次捫心反省，一個人的道德觀念即刻可以提高，正好比一個極度缺乏營養的病人決不能一次吞食大量的維他命而恢復健康一樣：但是我堅信，祇要他每天有一次捫心自問的機會，他的良心一定會强有力的拉他向上，使他進步，成功。</p>

<h3>捕風捉影</h3>
<p>— 毛毅</p>
<p>女子昏倒在街頭，被人扶進了一家藥房。於是，街上的聞人聚攏了來，後來者競先詢問：「發生了甚麼事？」事情有些神秘化起來，開始有人傳說：是對街的銀行被刧了。</p>
<p>數分鐘之後，一輛爲那女子所喚的救護車開來了，警官們排開羣衆，走進銀行。最後，人們開始詫異他們自己何以站在那裏。但是，沒有一個人知道。</p>
<p>這時，那個昏倒了的女子恢復了精力，走出藥房。她看到那麼一大夥人，便向人詢問發生了甚麼事情。</p>

<h3>怪契約</h3>
<p>— 冷冷</p>
<p>法國有一個富翁與一位落拓不覊虛無主義的靑年訂約，規定靑年必須在禁閉的暗室中獨住十五年，暗室中滿藏可供閱讀十五年的哲學名著書籍；富翁負責供給每日三餐，其餘一切槪不負責，期滿後把全部財產贈送給青年，半途離開暗室一步作毀約論，分文全無。並且由靑年另立憑據，言明期內因病死亡或自殺槪與富翁無涉。還有一條附則就是在契約履行期中，富翁因故死亡，靑年立刻有權取得全部財產的所</p>
<p>開始實行幾個月，送餐的傭人見到靑年終日引吭高歌，以後就無聲無息博覽羣書，過了一段相當時期又歇斯底里地自言自語高談闊論，第三年開始靑年好像在埋頭苦幹，參考書籍，努力寫作。這樣過了十年，一直到第十三年開始，富翁不幸因病死亡，顧問律師遵照遺囑，恭請靑年出室共同開啓保管箱，接受財產的時候，不料已經人去樓空。原來青年苦讀幾年已經成爲一位高深的哲學家，著有幾部專書，他覺得不能埋沒在暗室中虛度光陰，就毅然向送餐傭人行賄逃出來，現在已經榮任大學的哲學敎授，並且是著名的哲學權威。</p>
<p>律師好容易找到他，請他履行契約，他當然固辭不允，而富翁又無親屬繼承財產，所以在雙方同意下決議將財產掃數捐助公益事業。於是在哲學敎授律師與當地機關公正人士監視下，開啓富翁的保管箱，不料裏面空空如也，祇有一張富翁親筆簽名的紙條貼在箱內門上，簡單地寫着幾句話：「恭喜你已經成功一位著名哲學家，我知道你現在決不需要我的財產，學問名譽和地位才是你唯一的財產。我已經把所有財產用無名氏名義捐助給公益事業，你一定會贊成我的措施。願上帝降福給我們的哲學家！」</p>
<p>哲學敎授感謝富翁的恩惠，就在執敎的大學中用富翁名義，設立獎學金，永遠紀念他。</p>

<h3>童貫之死</h3>
<p>— 王百里</p>
<p>史童貫傳略云：「貫多權話，蔡京之進，貫有力焉，時人稱京爲公相，貫爲媼相。北伐之役，尋起邊釁，金人敗盟南下，貫聞奪魄，即奔入都，奉上皇南避，惟恐行之不速。後斬於英州」云云，正史所載如此，自可置信。惟據陸放翁老學庵筆記，謂貫誅於南雄州，該筆記載稱：「童貫旣有詔誅之命，御史張達明特詔行，將至南雄州，貫在焉，達明恐其聞而引決，則不及明正典刑，乃先遣親事官一人，馳往見貫，至則通謁，拜賀於庭，貫問故，曰：「有詔遺中使賜茶藥，穴召大王赴關，且聞已有河北宣撫之命。」貫問果否？對曰：今將帥皆晚進，不可委寄，故主上與大臣熟議，以有威望習邊事無如天王者，故有此命。」貫乃大喜，顧左右曰：「又却是少我不得！」明日，達明至，貫乃伏誅。」是貫之死於南雄州，不死於英州，其說明甚。余按南雄州，即今之南雄縣，地當廣東入贛要道，宋史謂貫斬於英州，英州或爲貫獲罪時謫官　置之所，並非係貫受誅之地，試觀老學庵筆記中「將至南雄，貫在焉」之語，可見當時張達明奉詔誅貫，原亦擬至英州，執行任命，惟將至南雄，聞貫在焉，故即於南雄，就地正法，不必再至英州也。且宋史爲元托克托等所撰，距實貫之死，一百數十年，其間難免有遺誤之處，而放翁爲南宋初年時人，去童貫之死基　，所見所聞，當較詳盡，是童貫之誅於南雄州，無可疑焉。</p>

<p>第九章　洩漏機密（五三）</p>
<p>綺紈道：「你所計劃的很對，不過東西廂房，我還想利用做健身房，預備台球案，和乒乓球桌，你看如何？」渚齋道：「那末把廂房平台舖上花磚，更美觀了。」綺紈道：「現在就這樣決定吧！你有相熟木廠沒有，一切你給我支配。」渚齋平日對計劃房子陳設等等，　是擅長，而且也最感興趣，一口答應。自這日起，每日渚齋除到銀行外，　替綺紈奔走土木工事，不但逐日前往監工，並爲計劃牆壁塗澤顏色，院宇佈置花石，力求美衛化，土木工事完了，又忙着安設燈光，陳設傢俱，一間屋子，一件東西，都務求適合，綺紈見他配置十分得法，非常高興，因爲自已對這一切，都不大內行，全盤交給渚齋辦理。經過兩個”期間，一座古老式的樓房，經渚齋一改造，竟變成非常美術化。渚齋在這兩月，逐日爲綺紈奔走，料理土木工事，置辦器貝等等，幾日無暇晷，不但鳳笙那裏不照面，就是雲卿宅裏，也不常往，雲卿是個細心人，見渚齋態度，日形冷淡，似別有所注，每在談話之間想試探他，他總諱莫如深，一點意思也試探不出。偶然提到二人將來的結果，渚齋祇縐着眉頭，深慮老父這一關，不容易打通。雲卿細察情形，將來要求完滿結果，老人方面，應運用如何方法，才能滿意，一時實在也想不出妙策，所慮渚齋近來神情，有些變態，不能不預爲防備。每見渚齋隔兩天未到，總打電話到銀行宿舍詢問，有時還要請他到家裏吃飯，渚齋給她如此一來，兩頭奔走，大有顧此失彼之勢，心裏甚是苦悶，屢向綺紈表示，我們結婚不如早日舉行，旅行結婚，最爲省事，偏是綺紈對於此點，毫不注意，認爲如此辦理，過於草率，旣然和鳳笙離婚，法律上已無問題，愛什麼時候結婚，便行結婚。渚齋見她不理會他的意思，又不能把其中苦情，完全吿訴她，心裘只是爲難，這一天渚齋下班之後，到綺紈新宅裏，和綺紈同到東城物色地氈，因爲綺紈的新宅一切事物，差不多都已布置就緒，祇有客廳的大地氈，還沒置妥，客廳牆壁是淺藍色，據渚齋的意思，地毯必須深藍色，才能配合，可是物色多少處，要找恰合綺紈客廳的尺度的深藍色的地毯，就不容易找到。這天由銀行中同人介紹在東城新記地毯行，看妥一塊藍色地毯，渚齊急約好綺紈，下班的時候，同到東城購買，不想雲卿連來幾次電話，約他前去。</p>

<h3>US Submits Plan to Far Eastern Commission to Support Japan's Reconstruction; We Have Received Note and are Studying It</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 25th] A Foreign Ministry official stated on the 25th: The Ministry has recently received a lengthy note from the United States submitted to the Far Eastern Commission of Eleven Nations in Washington, D.C., outlining the necessity of supporting Japan's self-sufficiency and self-reliance, requesting the endorsement of all Allied nations, and jointly participating in this "grand undertaking." The official declined to disclose whether the note was accompanied by a concrete numerical plan, but acknowledged that the Ministry attached great importance to it and was carefully studying it. The results of the study will be submitted to higher authorities for approval, and only after a final decision by the highest national policy-making body will instructions be given to our officials on the Far Eastern Commission to express our country's attitude. It is reported that since the news of the US War Department's request for US$500 million in aid to Japan reached this area, all parties have been paying close attention, and the official report has refrained from making any comments. The general view is that America's generosity towards Japan has exceeded what a victorious nation in World War II should extend to a nation still in a position of hostility, and that there is a tendency towards indulgence. In order to establish peace in the Far East, our country should urgently assert its position.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 25th] Deputy Foreign Minister Yeh Kung-chao, after confirming that we had received the US note regarding the plan to assist Japan's reconstruction, stated: This is a proposal made solely by the United States, and whether it can be established will depend on the Far Eastern Commission of Eleven Nations meeting to discuss and decide. As for our country's position, it will be stated after research and decision.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 25th] Li Jing-lu, Director of the Civil Aviation Administration of the Ministry of Communications, stated on the 25th: An agreement has been reached on our side opening up air transport routes between China and Japan. Our side is actively preparing, and the date of the inaugural flight has not yet been determined.</p>
<h3>Far Eastern Commission Stipulates Japanese Steel Production Levels</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 24th] Steel experts here say that it is rumored that the Far Eastern Commission has stipulated that Japan's annual production of pig iron should be 2 million tons and steel ingots 250,000 tons. To reach the steel production level stipulated by the Far Eastern Commission, Japan must import a large amount of pig iron and scrap iron. The level stipulated by the Commission is far higher than what the Japanese steel industry generally hopes for. The expert recently told a Central News Agency reporter that the 10 million tons of raw materials to be imported in the future will include 4 million tons of iron ore, 2 million tons of coking coal, and 1 million tons of other important materials. In addition, Japan must import 250,000 tons of pig iron from abroad to manufacture the 3.25 million tons of steel ingots stipulated by the Far Eastern Commission. The expert cited reliable foreign sources as saying that after the peace treaty is concluded, Japan will be allowed to own 1.5 million tons of coastal transport ships. The expert also emphasized that Japan must also have a merchant fleet for import and export trade in the future.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Tokyo, 25th] An Indian official in charge of reparations materials told the Associated Press on the 24th that most of the factory equipment compensated by Japan could not be described as "superior." Mr. Raju, a technical advisor to the Indian government, also stated that some of the factory equipment shipped to other countries needs to be partially repaired before it can be used. He was referring to shipyards, steel plants, and heavy chemical plants.</p>
<h3>Kowloon and Shameen Incidents; Negotiations Underway in London; Yeh Kung-chao Says Both Sides Have a Calm Attitude</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 25th] Deputy Foreign Minister Yeh Kung-chao stated on the 25th: The Kowloon City and Guangzhou Shameen incidents are still being actively and directly negotiated by our Ambassador to the UK, Zheng Tianxi, and the British Foreign Office. Both sides are seeking a reasonable solution with an extremely calm attitude. Ambassador Zheng has already reported to the Ministry, but there are no plans to make any statements at this time.</p>
<p>Kowloon City Residents' Relief Funds Fully Distributed by Guangdong Provincial Government</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Guangzhou, 25th] The provincial government's allocation of 500 million yuan to relieve the residents of Kowloon City has been fully distributed on the 20th. The personnel assisting in Hong Kong who were dispatched by the provincial government have also returned to the province to report. It is reported that the relief funds issued included approximately 32 million yuan for medical expenses and special relief funds, and 155.8 million yuan for ordinary residents' relief funds, totaling 187.81 million yuan in cash. The remaining funds were used to purchase 22,089 *si jin* of rice, which were handed over to the residents' association for acceptance and distributed jointly by the Bao'an County Government.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Hong Kong, 25th] A five-member delegation representing nine dance halls in Guangzhou and the *Hua Shang Daily* arrived here by car on the afternoon of the 25th. They are scheduled to take the 110 million *fa bi* they brought to Kowloon City on the 26th and distribute it to the homeless. Of this amount, 80 million yuan was raised by the Guangzhou nine dance hall dancers during a charity dance held on January 19th, and another 30 million yuan was raised by the *Hua Nan Daily* during a newspaper charity sale held on January 24th.</p>
<p>[Our Guilin Dispatch, 25th] In order to safeguard the sovereignty of Kowloon City, the Provincial Assembly specifically telegraphed Director Song of the Guangzhou Executive Headquarters, hoping for an early resolution.</p>

<h3>Speaker Pan Issues Statement: *Hong Kong Hua Shang Bao* Spreading Rumors</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, This City Dispatch] Speaker Pan Gongzhan of the Shanghai Municipal Council solemnly stated to our reporter Zheng today: "The Guangzhou dispatch published in the Communist Party's mouthpiece *Hong Kong Hua Shang Bao* on January 17th, which stated that after the Kowloon City incident occurred, I sent an urgent telegram to Guangzhou, addressed to party and group leaders, etc., is entirely fabricated. Regarding the Kowloon City incident, apart from telegraphing the Chairman of the National Government, advocating a stern negotiation, I have absolutely no other opinions or letters published."</p>
<h3>Burmese Police Raid Communist Underground Headquarters</h3>
<p>Three Arrested, Leader Escapes</p>
<p>[United Press, Rangoon, 25th] The Burmese Police Chief personally led 200 fully armed police officers to raid the Red Flag Communist underground headquarters hidden in a monastery yesterday at dawn, arresting Communist Party members Yu Shan Dao Basha and his followers Yu Nu and Yu Yang, etc. Another team of armed police officers, led by personnel from the Criminal Investigation Unit, surrounded a residence on Monastery Street and arrested Red Flag Party Secretary Ke Sai Bing and Communist Party member Daqin Xin Dong. The police seized a large number of radical documents in both locations that incited people to resist the government, as well as English propaganda materials from the Soviet Communist Party. The Red Flag Communist Party, led by Daqin Tiao, was declared an illegal organization by the Burmese government in the fall of 1946 and ordered to disband. Since then, the party has engaged in underground sabotage activities, attempting to overthrow the government. Daqin Su's whereabouts are currently unknown. It is rumored that he has fled to our country or to Arakan. The Rangoon police authorities are currently making every effort to investigate, with a view to arresting him in the near future.</p>
<h3>Our First Ambassador to Greece Presents Credentials to the Greek King</h3>

The Greek King sent a royal master of ceremonies and adjutant to greet Ambassador Wen. The ceremony was extremely grand. In his eulogy to the Greek King, Ambassador Wen said: "Both China and Greece are ancient civilizations with glorious histories, and they will surely overcome all difficulties and move towards a more glorious future. I am deeply honored to be appointed as the first ambassador by President Chiang. I wish Your Majesty good health and prosperity to your country." The Greek King's reply briefly stated that he was very pleased to have Your Excellency appointed as the first ambassador of your country. China and Greece are both ancient civilizations with difficult histories. He hopes that they will cooperate closely in the future to jointly protect world peace, and respectfully wishes President Chiang good health and prosperity to your country.</p>

While waiting for their flight in Shanghai, they will continue to negotiate with the Salt Affairs Bureau, the Central Bank, and the Transport Control Commission on issues such as the Changlu salt fees, finished products, and material procurement, and then fly to Peiping together on the 29th.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Tianjin, 24th] The Tianjin Industry and Commerce Guidance Office of the Ministry of Economic Affairs issued a lengthy telegram of over 1,000 words on the 24th, requesting the Ministry of Economic Affairs to forward it to the Executive Yuan to open up industrial loans before the Spring Festival to save the industrial crisis in North China.</p>

<p>[Associated Press, Qingdao, 25th] A Chinese observer, known for his free and progressive thinking, recently returned from the Lu Province area newly recovered by the National Army and published his thoughts on the 25th, saying: "In the Communist areas, there is no rule of law, because the Communist Party believes that the law is designed to protect the rich. The atrocities of the 'Liberated Area' government are extremely brutal. The October Revolution in the Soviet Union killed millions of people, but it still cannot compare to the cruelty of the revolutionary government in the CCP-controlled areas. In the Communist areas, all those who are regarded by the Communist Party as 'national spies, reactionaries, anti-Communists, suspected reactionaries, and those who refuse to obey the policies of the Communist Party' are massacred or tortured on a large scale. The Communist Party seems to be paranoid about anything that does not conform to the CCP's movement, and they universally use shockingly inhumane corporal punishment to interrogate 'unruly' suspects." This observer witnessed dismembered and rotting corpses, the results of "class struggle" assassinations, the ruthless liquidation of anti-Communists. An old farmer tearfully recounted that his son was ordered to kill his father and was killed by him. The old farmer was old and unwilling to change his beliefs, and was considered reactionary and feudal. He refused to "repent," and his son, a progressive youth, was tasked with killing his father, otherwise he would be stoned to death by the people. The father and son jointly dug a grave for the old farmer. His son regarded killing him as a trivial matter. The old farmer was stunned, and in a moment of urgency, killed his son with a plow. This is the general situation after the "people's revolution" succeeded. "Of course people die in revolutions, but in the CCP areas, the death penalty seems endless." The people in the Communist areas all hate the Communist Party.</p>

<h3>Uranium Ore Discovery is Not Easy: Experiences of American Mining Expert</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 24th, United Press] Matthew, a mining expert from the US Department of the Interior, said that traces of uranium ore, the material for making atomic bombs, are extremely scattered. He once picked up a piece inside Swarthmore College near Philadelphia. But he said that uranium ore is not like gold. If a gold nugget is found, there will definitely be more gold nearby, but the situation is different when a uranium nugget is found. Uranium ore may not be found even 100 miles away. Thousands of traces of uranium ore have been found on the East Coast, but there are no real deposits there. Someone with special equipment may find some ore deposits in the western United States. Most countries have been surveying for this metal in recent days, and rich uranium deposits have been found in the past few months. Apart from the western United States, reports have been made of discoveries in Burma and South Africa. He said that prospectors without surveying equipment must rely on their eyesight.</p>

<h3>Draft Presidential Office Organization Act; Legislative Yuan's Legal System Committee Soliciting Opinions from All Parties; Originally Planned Chief of Staff Has Been Eliminated</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 25th] The Presidential Office Organization Act is currently being reviewed by the Legal System Committee of the Legislative Yuan, which is soliciting opinions from all parties. It is expected that the entire draft can be completed by mid-February. It is reported that the newly drafted organizational law will, in principle, be smaller in scale than the previous one.

In addition, the Strategic Advisory Committee, which currently belongs to the National Government Committee, will be [unclear text] under the regulations of the Black Law, in the name of a Grand Advisor. It is also feared that the new provision for the establishment of a Political Advisory Committee under the Presidential Office will not be permitted, so it may be replaced by the name of Grand Advisor.</p>
<h3>Liaobei Recovers Dongfeng and Xifeng; Fierce Hand-to-Hand Combat Unfolds in Xinlitun; Fan Hanjie's Troops Gradually Arriving Outside the Pass</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Shenyang, 25th] The National Army in Liaobei is rapidly reporting good news. The National Army's troops advancing into the enemy's rear have been making rapid progress in recent days, taking advantage of the situation to recover Dongfeng. At the same time, our elite cavalry, with swift action, captured Xifeng in one fell swoop.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Shenyang, 25th] The battle of Xinlitun has reached a boiling point. Fierce hand-to-hand combat broke out between the two sides on the 24th, and the sound of gunfire continued throughout the night. The Communist bandits repeatedly attacked fiercely, suffering increasing casualties. Corpses of bandits were scattered around the station. As of dawn on the 25th, they were still fighting hard.</p>
<p>[Our Beiping Dispatch, 25th] A part of Fan Hanjie's army corps has already landed in Huludao, and another part will land in Qinhuangdao on the 26th and 27th. Troops will also be increased in the Guannei section of the Beining Railway. Counties along the railway have been ordered to begin merging small villages into large villages in order to facilitate defense. In addition, the North China Bandit Suppression Headquarters has slightly divided the defenses of Hebei. Shangguan Yunxiang commands the Jin-Yu section of the Beining Railway and the northern section of the Tianjin-Pukou Railway, An Chunshan is responsible for the Pingjin Road and the Pingjin-Bao triangle area, and Song Kentang is responsible for the northern section of the Pinghan Railway.</p>
<p>[United Press, Peiping, 25th] National Army sources say that the isolated force in Xinlitun is still engaged in fierce fighting with the Communist army. Both sides have suffered heavy casualties. The National Army is still supplying them by air. The two strongholds of Heishan and Dahushan south of Xinlitun seem to have been occupied by the Communist army, which hinders the National Army's northbound reinforcements. At the same time, the National Army is preparing to clear the section of the railway from Shanhaiguan to Shenyang. The troops recently transported by sea from Shandong to Huludao will participate in this sweeping operation. Local newspapers report that about 20,000 Communist troops are gathering near Dagu. Both the British and American consulates in Changchun are preparing to close and evacuate. They have been supplied by air for several months, but now they are finding it increasingly difficult.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Changchun, 24th] General Li Hong, Commander of the New Seventh Army and concurrently Commander of the Changchun Garrison, analyzed the bandit situation in various parts of the Northeast to the heads of various agencies here today.

There is another column in southern Liaoning, and a force of one column is placed northeast of Shenyang. There are no large bandits entrenched around Jilin and Changchun. According to his judgment, the total strength of the Communist army in the vast area north of Siping to the Songhua River will not exceed 50,000 men. Regarding the rumors that the government will abandon Jilin and Changchun, Li called them "absolutely unfounded rumors." He said that the troops and equipment in the two places that are rumored to be abandoned are currently being strengthened.</p>

<h3>Mobilization Meeting in Cultural Circles; Explanation of the Significance of Suppressing the Rebellion</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 25th] The General Mobilization Committee of Chinese Cultural Circles for Suppressing the Rebellion and Saving the Nation, in order to clarify the significance of suppressing the rebellion and ensure that the people have a correct understanding of it, so that they know where to direct their efforts, recently published an article entitled "Our Views on Suppressing the Rebellion," which is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Today's suppression of the rebellion is to quell the Communist Party's revolt. To refer to it as a "civil war" or a "factional struggle" is a superficial view. To understand the suppression of the rebellion, we must pay attention to its historical context.</p>
<p>China's economy is backward and has stagnated in the era of monarchical autocracy for a long time. In addition, due to imperialist aggression, it is necessary to undergo a revolution to strive for national independence, implement democratic politics, and improve the people's livelihood. To achieve these goals, building a unified country is an urgent need. The National Revolution of the past fifty years has completely followed this path.</p>
<p>Under these circumstances, we can only talk about the Three Principles of the People, not communism. Even the Communist Party acknowledges this, so when it comes to revolution, the Communist Party itself believes that it cannot carry out a socialist revolution at present, but only a democratic revolution. Since this is the case, it is very clear that communism does not meet the needs of the times. If you insist on doing something that does not meet the needs of the times, it will inevitably fail. What achievements can be made other than creating chaos?</p>
<p>We know that the Communist Party has a preconceived notion that the Chinese Kuomintang is not democratic, and that only it can implement democracy, so it shouts loudly for a democratic revolution. This is due to its deliberate misinterpretation of political tutelage. In fact, the democratic revolution is entirely the cause that the Chinese Kuomintang has been striving for. The Xinhai Revolution, the campaign against Yuan Shikai, the Constitutional Protection Movement, and the Northern Expedition were all implementations of the democratic revolution. As for convening the National Assembly and enacting and implementing the constitution, they have made the democratic revolution a success. This not only shows that the Kuomintang is a democratic party, but also shows that the Communist Party's shouting for a democratic revolution is empty and impractical.</p>
<p>Since what the Communist Party is doing is not a democratic revolution, it is very clear that its armed occupation of territory is a rebellion, a simple rebellion. The so-called democratic revolution is just a smokescreen to cover up its rebellion. Then the war to suppress the Communist Party's rebellion is indeed a suppression of the rebellion. This is completely true not only from a legal and formal point of view, but also from a political and practical point of view.</p>
<p>Is suppressing the rebellion a civil war? No. The Communist Party is an international political party with an international background. Its actions are subject to international orders, and it has also united with international armies such as the Korean Communists and Japanese prisoners of war. Therefore, its rebellion has international significance. At the same time, the Communist Party is a tool for new imperialism to invade China, just as warlords were tools for old imperialism to invade China. It is a red fifth column. Does this not show that the Communist Party's rebellion is a form of new imperialism's invasion of China? Therefore, suppressing the rebellion is a forward battle against aggression and has the significance of saving the country.</p>
<p>Then, is suppressing the rebellion a revolution? It is very clear that today's Communist Party rebellion is taking place in the era of revolution, that is, between the early and late stages of the National Revolution. Therefore, it has the effect of destroying the success of the early revolution and hindering the progress of the later revolution. Suppressing the rebellion is enough to maintain the success of the early revolution and facilitate the progress of the later revolution. This is of course a revolution, and it is also very clear that the Communist Party's rebellion is reactionary.</p>
<p>The Chinese Communist Party is a separatist force. It has been armed and occupying territory for twenty years. The purpose of suppressing the rebellion is to break the separatist regime and achieve unification. Unification is a political movement from feudalism to modernity, which can modernize the country. Therefore, unification is a revolution. Since suppressing the rebellion is for unification, it also has a revolutionary effect.</p>
<p>Suppressing the rebellion is not only for unification, but also for democracy. It must be known that the Communist Party's loud cry for democracy is purely a means. It is not a democratic party, and its doctrine is the dictatorship of the proletariat. In the so-called "liberated areas," what is implemented is violent rule, terror rule, and secret service rule. Recently, it has openly opposed the constitution. It must be known that the constitution is the codification and legalization of democracy, and it is a necessary method to make democracy a system. To implement democracy today, we must support the constitution. Suppressing the rebellion is to protect the constitution, and it is actually a democratic war, that is, a war between democracy and dictatorship.</p>
<p>In addition to its livelihood nature, suppressing the rebellion also has a nation-building nature. The Communist Party is a destructive force, specializing in tearing up roads, destroying mines, digging dikes, destroying factories, killing people, and arson, which is a hundred times worse than Japanese imperialism. If China wants to resist the threat of new imperialist aggression and improve the people's livelihood, it must also work hard to build. Therefore, we have the necessity of opposing destruction. Therefore, suppressing the rebellion is a struggle between construction and destruction.</p>
<p>The above explains the relationship between suppressing the rebellion and saving the country, unification, democracy, and nation-building, and these four are all requirements of the National Revolution. Suppressing the rebellion, in its nature as a war to save the country, a war to unify, a war for democracy, and a war to build the nation, is indeed a revolutionary war. Saving the country, unification, democracy, and nation-building are all practices of the Three Principles of the People, so suppressing the rebellion is a revolutionary war to strive for the Three Principles of the People, which is very important. Therefore, it cannot be denigrated as a civil war, nor can it be regarded as a factional struggle. May I ask, is saving the country, unification, democracy, and nation-building just a matter for the party and have nothing to do with the people and the country? Therefore, the people of the whole country should be mobilized unanimously, contribute money and effort, and actively participate. This is the revolutionary work at the current stage. If China is to be saved and built into a new China of democracy, unification, and the Three Principles of the People, only suppressing the rebellion can do it. This is China's way out and new life, and we should make every effort to complete it as soon as possible. For the sake of doctrine, for the sake of revolution, for the sake of the country, and for the sake of the people, we must start from this.</p>

<h3>A New Cooperation in Sino-American Journalism – Reflections on the Translation and Publication of "The Memoirs of Cordell Hull" by This Newspaper</h3>
<p>This newspaper will begin publishing "The Memoirs of Cordell Hull" on a daily basis starting today. There is no need to say that this memoir will be an important document of World War II, but its importance is not limited to this. World War II was the most devastating catastrophe in human history. As a result of this war, humans were prompted to use atomic energy. The Hiroshima bomb was not only the prelude to ending this catastrophe, but also ushered humanity into a new atomic age. Its importance in the entire history of mankind is comparable to the initial use of fire, the invention of planting, and the use of steam power. This war has marked a new era in the history of human culture. Whether this new era will bring destruction or prosperity to mankind remains to be proven by future facts, but it is undeniable that this war has brought mankind into a new era. The reason why mankind had this war was not due to the attack on Pearl Harbor, the invasion of Poland and Czechoslovakia, or the "incident" at Lugou Bridge. These superficial actions contained deeper conflicts. Before these actions were taken, there was a development of internal conflicts. The taking of these actions was merely the highest development of internal conflicts. In this sense, we see Prussian military strategists regarding war as the highest means of carrying out national policy. Therefore, modern warfare is the result of the accumulation of national policy conflicts. World War II had its historical background and was by no means an accidental event. Since World War II has opened up a new era for mankind, the outbreak of this war is an important key in human history. This key is not entirely in the hands of those who wield military power, but also in the hands of the diplomatic authorities who are responsible for negotiating and coordinating. It is feared that those who decide and implement foreign policy are the main writers of new pages in human history. One of the most important of these is undoubtedly Secretary of State Cordell Hull under President Roosevelt. He was appointed to his post at a time when the country was threatened by economic panic and when the great powers were only seeking immediate gains and isolation without assistance. By the end of his tenure, we saw the attack on Pearl Harbor, which triggered World War II. Hull is a historical figure. What he has written down is not only the history of the United States, but also the history of the world and the history of all mankind. Because of this, we feel extremely honored and delighted to have the opportunity today to translate and publish this new work, "The Memoirs of Cordell Hull," as soon as possible and to share it with the millions of readers in China.</p>
<p>What we want to point out here is that the publication of this memoir in this newspaper represents a new page in the history of Chinese journalism and even in the history of Sino-American relations. Chinese newspapers have always made as much use of foreign news agency manuscripts as possible. However, due to the continuous development of the news industry, in addition to news agencies providing news, there has also been the development of special news manuscript supply agencies, which are particularly developed in the United States. In the United States, there are various organizations of special news manuscript supply agencies that supply newspapers across the country with essays, monographs, and other special articles. The "syndicated features" are written by one person, and newspapers compete to purchase the copyright to publish them, so that they can reach a large number of readers. This development has been very effective in the United Kingdom and the United States, but in China, it still needs to be worked hard. As for establishing a relationship with American syndicated news manuscript supply agencies, the publication of "The Memoirs of Cordell Hull" by this newspaper is the first in China. This has to be said to be a new era in the history of the Chinese newspaper industry. We hope that in the future, the press circles of China and the United States will be able to have continuous and closer development.</p>
<p>Undoubtedly, the communication between people is an element that promotes international understanding. A key to this is the free flow of factual information and beneficial reading materials. In totalitarian countries, there is strict news censorship, and deep mutual understanding is almost impossible. Or even relying on narrow nationalism to maliciously exclude foreign manuscripts. All of these are contrary to the principle of free flow of news and information and violate the spirit of democratic politics. This newspaper's publication of "The Memoirs of Cordell Hull" supplied by the American Editors Press News Agency, which has obtained the copyright in various languages, including the original English copyright, in Shanghai, not only shows that this newspaper, although the oldest newspaper in Chinese history, is still a newspaper that seeks progress every day and is always new, but also shows the full freedom that the news industry in China can enjoy, reflecting the Chinese government's enlightened policy of absolute respect for freedom of the press and non-interference in the news industry.</p>
<p>Here, we must point out that all malicious rumors against the Chinese government are mostly fabricated by the Communist bandits. The purpose is very obvious. There are occasional reports in foreign newspapers about how the Chinese government controls public opinion and other malicious slanders. If they are published without scrutiny, they will do obligatory propaganda for the Communist bandits. It must be known that the Chinese government never wants to restrict the legitimate freedom of the people. The fact that this newspaper publishes manuscripts supplied by the American Editors Press News Agency can provide factual proof. We hope to have closer ties with our American counterparts so that we can fulfill our journalistic duty of free reporting and increase mutual understanding between China and the United States. When we say mutual understanding, we also hope that our American counterparts can have more contact with the press circles that can represent China, so that the truth about China can be faithfully reported to the United States, and the American people's understanding of China can also be increased accordingly. Cultivating friendship with neighbors and maintaining world peace may begin with these things!</p>

<h3>法政府正式通知英美　決實施法郎貶值　貶值令決延至今日宣布</h3>
<p>[United Press, Paris, 25th] The French government delayed the formal announcement of the franc devaluation by 24 hours on the 25th.

However, Schumann's spokesman announced on the evening of the 24th that the devaluation order would be delayed for another 24 hours.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Paris, 24th] French Finance Minister Mayer declared that the government's franc devaluation plan is expected to be formally announced on Sunday afternoon, and a joint communiqué on Anglo-French talks on the franc issue may also be released at the same time.</p>

The government's franc devaluation plan will be announced simultaneously with the International Monetary Fund's decision.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 24th] The Board of Directors of the International Monetary Fund continued to discuss the franc devaluation issue today. A spokesperson stated that there is no certainty whether the Fund can issue a formal statement within days. French officials have indicated that if the Fund does not adopt the franc devaluation plan, France will not hesitate to withdraw from the Fund. It is generally expected that the Fund's statement will emphasize the temporary nature of France's franc devaluation and express hope that France will soon have a more normal exchange rate system to replace the actions currently being taken.</p>
<p>[United Press, Paris, 24th] According to reliable sources: The French government has notified Washington and London today that, regardless of opposition from all parties, the export franc will be devalued starting on the evening of the 25th. France insists that this action is an important step to end the French economic crisis. It is reported that France has taken this action while British Chancellor of the Exchequer Cripps is here, having nearly 24 hours of debate, trying to persuade France to abandon this plan, and has boarded a plane to return to England. Cripps argued that any reduction in the value of the franc would inevitably lead to a devaluation of the pound sterling. He also insisted that the devaluation of the franc would endanger the new Western European alliance under the leadership of Britain and France, as proposed by British Foreign Secretary Bevin on the 22nd. The French cabinet is awaiting the opinion of the International Monetary Fund in Washington on the franc's decision. However, France appears to have already decided on how to proceed with this matter. In notes to London and Washington, France declared that the exchange rate of the export franc to the US dollar is 225 to 1. The current exchange rate between the franc and the dollar is 119 to 1. It is learned that there are two other programs in the French monetary stabilization plan: the establishment of a gold and foreign currency trading market in Paris, which will be submitted to the National Assembly on the 26th. The French cabinet has authorized open gold trading, but has been unable to decide on the franc devaluation for some time due to strong opposition from Britain. The French cabinet is seeking ways to resolve the economic turmoil in a two-hour emergency meeting. According to the new plan, legal entities holding foreign currency can sell foreign currency in France at open market prices. French Minister-Delegate Auberlin has hinted at a compromise agreement between Britain and France on the devaluation issue. Informed sources in London diplomatic circles say that even if the franc is devalued, it will not lead to a devaluation of the pound sterling. It is claimed that there are many loopholes in the French plan, through which speculators can buy pounds sterling at prices lower than the official rate, which "although not a major issue, will cause our anger."</p>
<h3>法郎貶值計劃實行後　英鎊價值難維持　英人士認爲原計劃漏洞甚多</h3>
<p>[United Press, London, 25th] British Foreign Office sources said on the 25th that France's franc devaluation plan will make it difficult to maintain the current value of the British pound, but France's actions will not trigger a devaluation of the pound. Sources close to the Treasury Department said: "This matter is quite annoying, but not a fatal blow." Britain is extremely concerned about France's plan to devalue the export franc and establish a free export market. British Chancellor of the Exchequer Cripps traveled to Paris with Treasury Secretary Sir Eady and Deputy Governor of the Bank of England Cobbold, which shows the importance Britain attaches to this matter.</p>
<p>Eady and Cobbold jointly traveled to the United States in August last year when Britain decided to suspend the free convertibility of the pound. Informed sources said: France's plan will create more loopholes, through which speculators can buy pounds sterling at a price lower than the official rate of four shillings and three pence. If so, it will be more difficult for the government to maintain the price, but this is not enough to cause a devaluation of the pound. The Financial Times said that the French plan will create "a gambler's paradise."</p>
<h3>美政府下令　增加銀行準備金</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 24th] The government has recently passed a measure to curb inflation in the banking system, which is a simple explanation of the new regulations of the Federal Reserve by government economists. According to the new regulations, banks under the control of Chicago and New York must increase their reserves from 20% to 22%. The new regulations will take effect on February 27. This regulation is not as drastic as directly controlling prices and rationing, but it is sufficient to freeze $100 million in Chicago and $420 million in New York. Currently, the total amount of reserves required by these banks is $4.3 billion in New York and $1 billion in Chicago. It is reported that most of the banking community supports the new regulations.</p>
<h3>促進歐洲團結謀取世界和科　本年九月將有兩大集會</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Geneva, 25th] Europe will hold two major conferences in September this year to seek world peace through a federal system. One is a conference to be held in Italy in early September, with the goal of establishing a world federal government. The other is the European Parliamentary Union, which will hold a meeting in Switzerland on September 8 to discuss the organization of the United States of Europe. The headquarters of the World Federal Government Movement is located in Geneva, and more than 50 organizations from 20 countries with the goal of establishing a world federal government have joined this international organization. Regarding the establishment of the United States of Europe, the Executive Committee of the European Parliamentary Union passed its outline at a meeting in Switzerland in December last year. The Executive Committee decided to convene a general meeting in Interlaken, Switzerland on September 8 this year to draft the constitution of the United States of Europe. Members of parliament from all European countries can send representatives to participate. It is expected that 13 countries, including Britain and France, will participate. It is said that the majority of members of parliament in Greece, Italy, the Netherlands, and Luxembourg support the organization of the United States of Europe.</p>
<h3>烏克蘭建國紀念　蘇外長致辭</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 24th] Moscow Radio said: Foreign Minister Molotov personally addressed the Supreme Soviet of Ukraine on the 30th anniversary of the founding of the Ukrainian Soviet Republic, saying that the great October Revolution had liberated the people of all Russia from the slavery of capitalism, indicating to the world the path of communism, introducing a free and happy life and a path of friendship between nations. The 30-year process of the founding of the Ukrainian Republic is full of struggles for economic and cultural revival. During the war, Ukraine was occupied by the German imperialist army, and there were bourgeois elements in Ukraine who were willing to be driven by it. At the beginning of the founding of the Soviet Union, the attempts of Britain and France to intervene in Ukraine with military force were also well-known facts. However, with the help of the Soviet Union, the land of Ukraine was finally unified, and the population of Ukraine is now almost equal to that of any of the largest countries in Europe. Today, we are here to celebrate the 30th anniversary of the founding of Ukraine, which is of great significance in terms of time for the people of Ukraine and the entire Soviet Union.</p>
<h3>捷克破獲間諜機關</h3>
<p>[United Press, Prague, 25th] A formal communiqué on the 25th stated that a total of fifteen civilians, soldiers, and women have been arrested on charges of "conducting espionage activities for a certain Western power." The communiqué stated that these spies are mostly Sudeten Germans, who maintain contact with repatriated German family members and friends. They were suspected of providing a certain Sudeten German spy organization, established by a certain Western power, with information about the Czech army and factories "of military importance." The communiqué stated that the group is mainly composed of former secret police, Nazi SS, and other similar criminals.</p>
<h3>外長代表將開會　　討論奧境德資產</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 25th] The special representatives of the four foreign ministers are scheduled to meet this week to discuss the Soviet proposals on German assets in Austria and the French compromise proposals. A British Foreign Office spokesman said that the secretariat of the Foreign Ministers' Conference has received the full text of the recent Soviet proposals, and some points are clearer than before.</p>
<h3>The Western European Union Plan Actively Unfolds: Britain Seeks Diplomatic Initiative; McNeil Expresses Continued Willingness to Reconcile with the Soviet Union</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 24th] Foreign Secretary Bevin's announcement of the launch of the Western European Union plan, and the simultaneous declaration by the French government, have broken the diplomatic silence following the failure of the London Foreign Ministers' Conference. It is now known that with the apparent support of the United States, Britain and France have launched a new policy in the West, seizing the diplomatic initiative from the countries east of the Elbe River. Regarding Britain, the actions to be implemented following the adoption of the new policy are as follows: Unite Western European countries and their overseas territories to develop the Western European Union; Constitutional reforms in West Germany, possibly merging the three occupation zones of Britain, the United States, and France, and establishing an international regime for the Ruhr; Britain completes a network of treaties with Arab countries to establish a regional security system in the Middle East; Continue cooperation with countries participating in the Marshall Plan.</p>
<p>The general objective of Bevin's policy is to engage in cooperation with countries that are politically sympathetic to Britain.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Gateshead, Durham County, 24th] Minister of State McNeil delivered a speech at a Labour Party meeting here, reiterating Britain's willingness to talk and use all diplomatic procedures to seek better relations with the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe, and to discuss any issues between them. "This is our country's policy, and we will never abandon it. We will continue to play an active role in the United Nations organization, accept the obligations incumbent upon member states, and are always willing to use the various agencies of the United Nations. I would like to reiterate that we will never abandon this policy." Labour left-wing Member of Parliament Zilliacus, elected from the Gateshead constituency, then spoke, saying, "Churchill once said that the Labour government has adopted his speech delivered in Fulton, USA, which is indeed the case. Churchill's Fulton speech advocated the establishment of an Anglo-American Western alliance and used war as a threat against the Soviet Union." Watson, a leader of the Durham miners, stated that 90% of those attending the meeting were strong supporters of the government.</p>
<p>United Nations Watchful</p>
<p>[United Press, Lake Success, 24th] Regarding the increasing development of the Western European Union plan, the United Nations stated on the evening of the 24th that it marked the end of the "One World" concept of international relations. This is the United Nations' sharpest response to Bevin's call to establish a Western European bloc to counter the Soviet Union. United Nations diplomats have widely divergent opinions on who is to blame for this plan and what the final outcome of the Western European bloc plan will be. However, there seems to be unanimous agreement that the United Nations is currently facing a serious test, and some even express doubts about the survival of the United Nations organization. A senior representative of China, who is among the most supportive of Western powers in the United Nations, also stated that the Western bloc plan is incompatible with the concept of "One World." United Nations officials are now watching how the Soviet Union and Western countries are abandoning the United Nations Charter, the Soviet Union's boycott of the United Nations' main and related organizations, the Truman Doctrine and the Marshall Plan's actions bypassing the United Nations, the tactics of using the Security Council and the General Assembly to exert pressure on each other between East and West, and the gradual hardening of the Eastern and Western blocs within the United Nations organization, which are said to be preventing the United Nations from achieving its goals. It is said that the Nordic countries and Asian countries (such as India) also seem to be gradually joining the Western camp, and although the Arab countries are extremely indignant at the United States' partition plan for Palestine, they will still join the Western camp.</p>
<p>Moscow's Reaction</p>
<p>[United Press, Moscow, 24th] TASS News Agency announced on the 24th that British Foreign Secretary Bevin's proposal to strengthen Western Europe is a "smokescreen" for the establishment of a Western European bloc. In reality, the Western European bloc has already been formed, and the simultaneous establishment of political, economic, and military alliances is an undeniable fact. Britain's willingness to conclude defense treaties with Iran, Iraq, Egypt, and other Arab countries also reveals the shadow of the Eastern bloc, which is obvious to anyone with intelligence. The United Kingdom and the United States want to use a chain of treaties to bind the Arab countries. Washington and London are now developing a military-political joint program, attempting to use all bases in the Middle East for their armed forces. The Soviet Union has always opposed the establishment of any Western European bloc, considering it detrimental to its own interests. Therefore, its opposition to Bevin's plan will almost certainly be the same as its efforts against the Marshall Plan. According to Radio Moscow commentator Inevsky, Bevin is now a tool of American imperialists' European plan and has clearly taken a step forward in this true mission. It is no coincidence that the United States had a demand for a Western European alliance before Bevin publicly declared his position. Bevin is a loyal servant of the capitalists and has given the best performance of bowing to money and American imperialists.</p>
<h3>Review of the European Recovery Program: British, French, and Italian Talks Conclude; Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg Secretly Contact Britain and France at the Beginning of Next Month</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Rome, 24th] The British Embassy issued a communique announcing that the talks between Britain, France, and Italy on the Marshall Plan have successfully concluded. The main matters reviewed during the meeting were the economic progress since the Paris Sixteen Nations Conference, including European cooperation and the implementation of the national plans of each participating group. The meeting also studied the steps to be taken to establish a continuing structure in which all countries willing to participate in the European Recovery Program can participate. Furthermore, the British and French delegations will visit the capitals of other European countries participating in the Marshall Plan.</p>
<p>[United Press, The Hague, 24th] The Dutch Foreign Ministry announced today that delegations from the British and French governments are scheduled to meet here on February 3 with delegations from the Belgium, Netherlands, and Luxembourg customs union to discuss the Marshall Plan. The head of the Dutch delegation, Hans區斐爾, stated that the meeting will discuss the relationship between the sixteen European countries participating in the Marshall Plan.</p>
<p>[United Press, Bari, Italy, 24th] U.S. Ambassador to Italy Dunn stated: The Communist Party's claim that the United States intends to turn Italy into a U.S. colony is "a despicable and unfounded slander." Dunn's first formal response to the Communist Party's attacks on U.S. aid to Europe, Dunn attacked the left-wing newspapers' attacks as attacks on the U.S. government's aid program to Italy. The left-wing newspapers have made great efforts to make the Italian people believe that transporting goods to supply food rations and transporting coal to prevent workers from losing their jobs is equivalent to U.S. imperialism. In some cases, this slander even claimed that the purpose of U.S. aid is to turn Italy into a U.S. colony.</p>
<h3>Vandenberg Proposes Independent Agency to Manage the Marshall Plan; President Has the Right to Decide If There Are Problems</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 25th] Secretary of State Marshall's proposal that the European aid program be managed by the State Department has been opposed by many parties. Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Vandenberg advocates that it be governed by an independent agency. His plan, which was drafted by the Brookings Institution at Vandenberg's request, was released by Vandenberg yesterday. The content is to establish a special department, headed by a minister-level official appointed by the President and approved by the Senate. The Secretary of State and the State Department can only raise questions and protests. If there is any dispute between the two parties, it will be handled by the President. In addition, Democratic Senator George also said: "I firmly believe that the final governing body should be independent. Our donations and their uses should be decided by experienced administrative officials and committees."</p>
<h3>Mountbatten to Resign in June; An Indian Will Be Selected to Succeed Him as Governor-General</h3>
<p>[Reuters, New Delhi, 25th] The Indian government announced today that Lord Mountbatten has decided to resign as Governor-General of India in the first week of June. Mountbatten informed the Indian Constituent Assembly on August 15 of last year, the day Britain transferred power to India, that he would apply for resignation on the 4th of this year. Later, Mountbatten stated that if India could have an Indian to serve as the constitutional head of state, India could feel more fully free. It is expected that India will not leave the British Commonwealth until the end of this year. After Mountbatten resigns as Governor-General, an Indian will succeed him as Governor-General.</p>
<h3>Kashmir Incident: Britain Urges India and Pakistan to Reconcile</h3>
<p>Police Agree to Draft Voting Plan</p>
<p>[Reuters, Lake Success, 24th] The Indian and Pakistani delegations have agreed to draft a plan to hold elections in Kashmir. This agreement was reached after the Security Council extended the discussion of the Kashmir case, which had been ongoing for a week. British representative Bagg urged the delegations of the two countries to submit a reasonable and peaceful compromise plan by Monday, pointing out that if the conflict in Kashmir is allowed to continue, it may expand, and if it unfortunately develops into a war, it will be the most terrible thing in Indian history. The way to avoid war is to reach an agreement in the Security Council. The French representative put forward three conditions for holding a referendum: Foreign troops withdraw from Kashmir; The original residents who fled return to Kashmir; A neutral administrative body is established to avoid putting pressure on residents. It is reported that after the Indian and Pakistani delegations submit the referendum plan, the Chairman of the Security Council will convene a round table meeting.</p>

<h3>Arab Armed Forces Cross the Border into the Holy Land</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Jerusalem, 24th] Official announcement: 750 Arab troops, equipped with light armored vehicles and other sophisticated weapons and several trucks, infiltrated Palestine from Transjordan and have established a headquarters in the mountains northeast of Nablus. This is the largest Arab armed force to infiltrate the Holy Land since the UN General Assembly established the partition resolution. They are led by senior Arab military officers. The British army did not notice them crossing the border. The British army has been ordered to step up security on the border to prevent further infiltration. At the same time, the Palestinian government has protested to the Transjordan government about this matter. According to Arab sources, no fewer than hundreds of Arab armed forces have infiltrated Palestine from abroad in recent weeks, and now there are thousands of well-trained Arabs gathered in the mountains of Nablus, waiting for an opportunity to go to war.</p>
<h3>France First Uses Temporary U.S. Aid to Pay for More Than 50,000 Long Tons of Coal</h3>

General Eisenhower announced his withdrawal from the campaign yesterday, but at least four states supporting General Eisenhower have stated that they will continue to work to get him to participate in the Republican presidential candidate campaign regardless of Eisenhower's wishes. Aim to Increase Export Trade</p>
<h3>Japanese Government Drafts Five-Year Economic Plan</h3>
<p>Aim to Increase Export Trade</p>
<p>[News Agency, Tokyo, 24th] The Japanese government is drafting a five-year economic plan, hoping to export more than one billion yuan of goods annually starting in 1951, which is four times the current export volume. The American occupation authorities believe that this long-term goal can be achieved based on the current rate of economic progress. Newspapers have published Japan's self-help plan, which increases imports annually, so there will still be a trade deficit in 1952. The details for this year show exports of 19 million U.S. dollars and imports of 781 million U.S. dollars, all of which are food and industrial raw materials. According to the occupation authorities, the export target for 1948 can be achieved, but the import estimate is inevitably too high.</p>
<h3>Cloth for Relieving Refugee Overseas Chinese Arrives in Southeast Asia for Distribution</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Batavia, 24th] The cloth provided by our government to relieve overseas Chinese refugees in Java and Sumatra will be distributed by the Chinese General Association here.

<h3>Vice President Hatta Tells Reporters That Indonesia Will Form a Mixed Cabinet to Implement a Ceasefire and Continue Negotiations with the Netherlands</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Batavia, 24th] Indonesian Republic Vice President Hatta told reporters in Yogyakarta on the 24th that he intends to organize a "Presidential Business Cabinet" to succeed the Xia Lifuting Cabinet. Observers believe that Hatta's words indicate that he will select cabinet members regardless of party affiliation, based on efficiency. Hatta also announced his new government's four-point plan, namely: Implement the ceasefire agreement; Continue negotiations under the auspices of the United Nations Mediation Committee; Implement state-owned programs within the Republic; Launch a revival plan.</p>
<h3>The Indonesian Mediation Committee Once Flew to Yogyakarta to Study the Truth About the Indonesian Cabinet Tide</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Batavia, 25th, United Press] Members of the United Nations Indonesian Mediation Committee returned to Batavia after visiting Yogyakarta for a day and holding political discussions with Indonesian representatives there.</p>
<p>[United Press, Batavia, 25th] Important members of the United Nations Mediation Committee flew to the capital of the Indonesian Republic on the 24th to inspect whether the cabinet tide of the Republic means that the agreement reached between Indonesia and the Netherlands last week has come to an end. The cabinet resigned on the 23rd due to attacks from the Nationalist Party, which expressed great dissatisfaction with the terms of the agreement. Vice President Hatta plans to form a new cabinet, but detailed plans have not yet been released. The United Nations representatives who flew to the Indonesian capital included American representative Graham, Australian Deputy Representative Cretzili, Belgian Deputy Representative Freeman, and U.S. State Department advisor Ogben. The Indonesian Nationalist Party opposes the terms of the agreement, which allow the Dutch to temporarily control the rich rice and rubber areas of Java and Sumatra. The basic issue of the conflict is: How can the Dutch still maintain their control after being driven out by the Japanese army in this area in 1942? They had agreed last year to recognize the United States of Indonesia (composed of the Republic of Indonesia and two other states) and the Kingdom of the Netherlands as equal members of the Dutch-Indonesian Union. Although the Republic's representatives have accepted the Dutch proposal, the agitated Indonesian Nationalist Party still insists on complete independence.</p>
<h3>Soviet Ambassador Pan Youxin Advocates Expanding Trade Between the U.S. and the Soviet Union to Improve Diplomatic Relations Between the Two Countries</h3>
<p>[Our News] New York, 25th, broadcast: Washington News, Soviet Ambassador to the U.S. Pan Youxin formally met with reporters from the American United Press for the first time today, advocating expanding U.S.-Soviet trade as a step to improve U.S.-Soviet diplomatic relations. He said that the people of both countries are interested in this action, and criticized certain people in the U.S. government for attempting to obstruct U.S.-Soviet trade relations with "discriminatory" provisions. He did not specify what the so-called discrimination refers to, but clearly referred to the recent announcement by the U.S. Department of Commerce to tighten export controls. Asked whether the increasing differences between the U.S. and the Soviet Union are inevitable, the ambassador replied that the Soviet Union's foreign policy is based on the premise that the two major countries can coexist.</p>
<h3>Hull's Memoirs, Copyright by North American Newspaper Alliance, Translated by Our Editorial Department: Roosevelt Was a Charismatic Figure</h3>
<p>During my twelve years in the State Department, the President and I never spoke to each other in harsh terms. Of course, we sometimes had important disagreements, but we were always able to resolve them sincerely, frankly, and in a friendly spirit. In general, our relationship was extremely harmonious.</p>
<p>The President respected the condition I had set when I accepted the position of Secretary of State, which was that I did not want to be merely a messenger between our government and foreign governments, but that I wanted to fully participate in the formulation and implementation of foreign policy.</p>
<p>He and I shared the same views on most aspects of international relations. If something new developed when we were not together, either of us could often guess what action the other would take. This similarity of views on foreign policy was a major factor in our good working relationship.</p>
<p>In these memoirs, I will mainly write about the work of our government in handling foreign affairs. I do not intend to describe the achievements of the Roosevelt administration in domestic affairs. The President was the primary architect of these efforts. The domestic panic that the Roosevelt administration inherited from the previous administration, as well as the remedies devised under his leadership and the unprecedented major reforms implemented, were enough to earn him a high and permanent place in our country's domestic history. I also do not intend to describe the President's achievements as Commander-in-Chief of our armed forces in the recent World War, except for certain aspects related to joint diplomatic and military policies that may be occasionally touched upon. His outstanding achievements in military affairs have also made him one of the most talented commanders-in-chief in our history. In short, he was a truly great president.</p>
<p>During my tenure in the State Department, I found that in most cases, I had to make decisions on my own. Although the Secretary of State should consult with the President on important policy matters and is the President's agent in foreign affairs, in practice, the Secretary of State often acted according to his own ideas and assumed responsibility for them. I could issue instructions to American representatives abroad, request explanations from foreign representatives stationed in our country, send diplomatic notes to foreign governments, and negotiate treaties with these governments.</p>
<p>I had to use my own judgment to determine whether certain policies or developments were important enough to bring to the President's attention. Sometimes I presented a question involving new policies to the President, along with appropriate recommendations. At other times, a question, although related to government policy, was not very important and did not need to be brought to his attention, or the question fell within the scope of a general policy or a well-established idea that he had already endorsed.</p>
<p>For example, during the Italo-Abyssinian War, I advocated moral sanctions, paying particular attention to Italy. The President was on a cruiser near the coast of Mexico at the time. I told him that if he agreed, we would suggest announcing the sanctions in his name, and he immediately agreed.</p>
<p>Another example is our efforts to mediate the Chaco War at the Montevideo Pan-American Conference. I regarded this work as part of the conference's various procedures to promote peace and took appropriate decisions. I kept the President informed of the general progress of the work.</p>
<p>Another example is my negotiations with Britain to lease bases from Newfoundland and British Guiana in exchange for fifty overage American destroyers. The President and I discussed this issue once and reached a general understanding. He then transferred the task of negotiating with Britain to me. I spent ten full days on this work, keeping the President informed of the progress of the negotiations. When the negotiations were concluded, I was responsible for signing on behalf of the government. In addition, I was responsible for exchanging a telegram with Churchill, during which he formally guaranteed that the British Navy would never, under any circumstances, fall into German hands or be scuttled.</p>
<p>There are many other examples, too numerous to mention. The last example is the negotiations with the Japanese ambassador in the nine months before the Pearl Harbor attack. I held forty or fifty meetings with the Japanese ambassador, most of them in my hotel apartment. I kept the President informed of the main points of the discussion and arranged for the President to meet with the ambassador, preparing materials.</p>
<p>Neither the President nor I had much experience in the technical aspects of handling foreign affairs. Because we immediately encountered countless problems that had to be dealt with, we quickly gained this experience. The major task of implementing policies and applying basic principles to the extremely complex problems that needed to be solved abroad largely fell on my shoulders. Especially in the early years, my work became even more burdensome because of the indescribable chaos in the domestic situation, which required the President's extraordinary attention every day.</p>
<p>During President Roosevelt's first term, he was so immersed in domestic problems that he left me almost entirely responsible for foreign affairs. I kept him fully informed of all major developments, but he wanted me to take the initiative in policy and action. From his second term onwards, his interest in and actual participation in foreign affairs greatly increased.</p>
<p>Roosevelt had an extremely broad knowledge of foreign affairs. Since Jefferson and Adams, no president has had a broader knowledge of foreign peoples and situations. Although he sometimes contacted the heads of other governments directly, making it difficult for us to deal with, and he forgot the diplomatic implications of his military decisions, his view of the world was progressive and visionary.</p>
<p>He was a figure of great personal charisma, and he was often able to make himself affable and attractive in conversation, which was helpful in dealing with foreign politicians and diplomats. He had a rare judgment of human psychology and was often able to communicate an idea or appeal most effectively to the public. In this regard, I don't think anyone can compare to him except for Theodore Roosevelt. His most successful performance was to announce great slogans and principles, such as the Four Freedoms, to the world in a very dramatic form. His extensive knowledge of people, his vitality, and his consistently accurate judgment made him extremely suitable to be a leader.</p>
<p>With very few exceptions, the President could hardly have been more considerate during my twelve years as Secretary of State. He almost invariably approved my opinions or suggestions, which often involved important foreign policy issues. Except for his meetings with Churchill and Stalin, which he saw as primarily military in nature, he almost always consulted my opinion or consent before taking important steps in diplomatic relations. In many, many cases, he wanted me to provide material for diplomatic speeches or to help him draft messages and responses to Churchill, Stalin, and other heads of government.</p>
<p>Harry Hopkins once told me that a person could serve President Roosevelt for any length of time, and the President would never thank him. But Hopkins went on to say that Roosevelt was, in fact, always grateful for everything that such a person did for him. I replied that my relationship with him had always been seamless, with no disagreements. I also said that in many cases, he expressed full appreciation for certain aspects of my work.</p>
<p>When the President or I returned from a trip, or after a period of absence, he almost always notified me and invited me to his office for lunch, so that we could discuss various issues and situations without disturbance.</p>
<p>Lunch was brought in (without alcohol) and placed on the large desk in his oval office. I was very familiar with this office. It was in this room that I first met President Wilson, and later Presidents Coolidge and Hoover.</p>
<p>Our conversations were informal. The President often had an interesting story he had just heard to tell. After that, we could discuss current issues for about an hour. There were always only the two of us, with very few interruptions, although sometimes important people would call and the President would have to answer.</p>
<p>In conversation, he was always considerate of the other person. Sometimes when we disagreed on important issues, and I argued from the opposing side, he never showed any impatience. He listened attentively until I was finished, without interrupting. Often when one of us knew that the other held a firm belief after careful consideration, we would avoid excessive debate at the appropriate time.</p>
<p>Our conversations were almost entirely about foreign affairs, but sometimes I would not hesitate to express my views on general domestic issues. On a few occasions, I seemed to say something like, "Since my youth, I have studied free-thinking mentors like Locke, Milton, Pitt, Burke, and Gladstone, as well as the Georgist school. I was influenced by Wilson's free thinking, and my record in Congress involved 90 to 100 percent of labor-related issues, mainly concerning progressive legislation. But I can't help but feel that you are proceeding too fast and too far in some domestic reforms, without sufficient time to adapt to domestic conditions. The people do not have time to digest them. I believe that the country periodically needs time to adapt to some radical new policies, and in some respects, the policies themselves seem a bit too radical."</p>
<p>I also explained that I did not agree with the government's policy of spending large sums of money on domestic problems forever, and I have always advocated achieving a balanced budget based on progressive and practical policies, and that the country's sound progress in all important areas requires this as a solid foundation.</p>
<p>The President's attitude was always very respectful, listening to me until I finished. After that, he would continue eating or smoking, without saying anything. After a few seconds of silence, he or I would bring up something else, and the conversation would turn in another direction.</p>
<h3>Major Earthquake in the Philippines, Capital of Panay Island Suffers Heaviest Damage</h3>

The epicenter was 12,000 kilometers away, and the direction could not yet be determined. Director Leech said that this was the strongest earthquake the laboratory had detected since the great Japanese earthquake of 1946. According to a report from West Bromwich, Staffordshire, England, the astronomical observatory there also detected a very strong earthquake that lasted for two and a half hours and was still ongoing. The source was either on an island in the Central Pacific or in the Patagonian waters at the southern tip of Chile.</p>

<h3>Senior Ship Officers Resolves Yesterday to Request Immediate Restoration of Voting Rights</h3>
<p>Regarding the matter of participating in the Legislative Yuan elections, various senior ship officer groups held a joint emergency meeting of member representatives yesterday afternoon to discuss solutions. It was unanimously resolved to immediately telegraph President Chiang Kai-shek of the National Government and relevant authorities, requesting that the measures for senior ship officers to participate in the elections be announced immediately upon receipt of the telegram. If the government and the election authorities still do not provide clear instructions for restoring the deprived rights to vote and to be elected within days, then senior ship officers nationwide have decided to surrender their certificates and wait to take the examination and obtain legal certificates before practicing their profession again.</p>
<h3>Yang Junming Discusses Identity Issue</h3>
<p>More than a hundred members of the Shanghai Journalists' Association, including Yan Fuzhou, jointly submitted a report to the National Occupational Women's Election Authority to investigate the identity issue of Yang Junming, a candidate for the Eastern European National Assembly, as reported in the previous newspaper. Yesterday, Yang Junming happened to be in Shanghai on business, and a reporter from the Huadong News Agency went to interview him. According to Yang, he had just returned to Shanghai from Nanjing this morning and had not heard about the investigation into his qualifications by the Shanghai Journalists' Association. He had not had time to read the newspapers from the previous two days since arriving in Shanghai, so he was unaware of all the details. When the reporter asked about his past experience, he replied that he had done work in all areas, and because he was ashamed of not having made any achievements, the news media might feel unfamiliar with him. However, he was nominated by the party (the Democratic Socialist Party) to participate in the National Assembly election. If the members of the Journalists' Association had indeed taken this action, he personally had no objections, and he believed that the party might express opinions on his behalf after the election authorities officially replied and announced their decision. Finally, when asked if he felt surprised by the actions of the Journalists' Association, he laughed and said, "Why not ask the members of the Journalists' Association?"</p>
<h3>Zhang Xiaosong Resigns, Mayor Wu Persuades Him to Stay</h3>
<p>Mr. Zhang Xiaosong, Director of the Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Civil Affairs, has been in charge of civil affairs for two years. In the past, he handled the reorganization of household registration, conscription, and the National Assembly and Legislative Yuan elections. His work was heavy, and his achievements were outstanding. Now, due to health problems, he suddenly submitted his resignation. It is said that Mayor Wu has persuaded Mr. Zhang to stay. However, according to Director Zhang, he told a reporter from the Huadong News Agency yesterday that he was physically unable to continue and wished to step down and make way for a capable person. His intention to resign was extremely firm, and if it was not approved this time, he would prepare to submit his resignation again.</p>
<h3>Speaker Pan Invited to Give a Broadcast Speech Today</h3>
<p>Speaker Pan has been invited by Mr. Yu Shuping, Director of the Shanghai Municipal Police Bureau, to give a broadcast speech at 3:15 PM today on the seventh floor of the bureau's headquarters in the northern district. The topic of his speech is: "Please pay attention to the activities of the City Council."</p>
<h3>Minister Yu and Others Meet Again, Decision to Implement Comprehensive Rice Rationing Starting in March</h3>
<p>Rationing Quantity May Change</p>
<p>After arriving in Shanghai the day before yesterday, Minister of Food Yu Feipeng invited Mayor Wu, Director Wu of the Social Affairs Bureau, and Ren Xianqun, Standing Committee Member of the Civil Food Allocation Committee, at 6:00 PM yesterday to discuss the comprehensive rice rationing in the city and the expansion of the Civil Food Allocation Committee's organization. According to Wu Kaixian, Director of the Social Affairs Bureau, Minister Yu's visit to Shanghai resulted in the decision to implement rice rationing in the city starting in March. The original quantity was set at two dou per person per month, with one dou rationed by the government and another ten dou provided with a purchase permit to buy from the market. However, according to Minister Yu, the Ministry of Food recently received opinions from foreign experts suggesting that a consumption of one dou and five sheng of rice per person per month is sufficient. The Ministry of Food is still considering the rationing quantity and may ration one dou and eight sheng of rice per person per month, with eight sheng rationed by the government and a purchase permit issued for one dou of rice. As for the price of the rationed rice, Mr. Wu said that it would likely be calculated at 60% of the market price for that month. Currently, industrial and professional workers in the city are rationed at 240,000 yuan per dan, which is based on 60% of the current market price. After the comprehensive rationing is implemented, this matter will be handled by the Shanghai Municipal Civil Food Allocation Committee. However, the committee's staffing is very small, and the previous committee requested the Executive Yuan to expand and reorganize the agency, and to send personnel from the central government to preside over it, so as to facilitate the promotion of allocation matters. It is reported that Minister Yu plans to ask Mayor Wu to serve as the chairman of the reorganized allocation agency, and Director Wu and Ren Guqun to serve as the vice-chairmen. It has not yet been decided whether to continue to use the original name of "Civil Food Allocation Committee" or change it to another name, but the reorganization date should be announced in early February.</p>
<h3>Social Affairs Bureau Calls Together Grain Merchants, Discussion Meeting to be Held This Morning</h3>
<p>This city is the first region to implement comprehensive food rationing. In order to ensure that the city's grain merchants understand the significance of food rationing and the specific measures, the Social Affairs Bureau has specifically scheduled a discussion meeting for the administrators of the city's north and south grain markets at 9:00 AM today to report on various matters related to rice rationing.</p>
<h3>Wenzhou Rice Prices Soar, Fellow Townsmen Plan to Transport Relief</h3>
<p>Wenzhou and its neighboring counties are rice-producing areas, and normally rice prices are much lower than in Shanghai. Recently, however, prices have suddenly soared, with only seven jin of rice being purchased for every 100,000 yuan, meaning that the price per shi has reached as high as 2,200,000 yuan. Moreover, the grain supply is lacking, making it difficult to find grain to buy, and the people are panicked. The situation is very serious. A few days ago, the Wenzhou Fellow Townsmen's Association in Shanghai held a meeting of directors and supervisors, and the chairman of the association, Yao Baozhen, proposed the issue of how to provide relief for the Wenzhou grain shortage. Subsequently, the association received a joint telegram from social figures in Wenzhou requesting that rice and flour be purchased and transported to Wenzhou. The association specifically convened an emergency symposium yesterday. Because the transportation of food between Shanghai and Wenzhou is prohibited, it was decided to telegraph the Ministry of Food requesting a certificate to allow the purchase of 10,000 bags of rice from Wuhu to be transported to Wenzhou for emergency relief, and Xu Jiqin, Yao Baozhen, and Zhang Yimiao were designated to go to Beijing to seek instructions. It is reported that the association has already telegraphed the Ministry of Food.</p>
<h3>Gold and Silver Jewelry Transactions Expected to Resume After the New Year</h3>
<p>Since the State Council passed the measures to open up gold jewelry transactions, the city's gold and silver jewelry industry has been actively preparing to resume business. The Economic Affairs Administration has begun to handle the re-registration of the gold and silver jewelry industry, and temporary business licenses will be issued after the audit is qualified. It is reported that this work will be completed before the end of the lunar year, and it is expected that all businesses will resume after the New Year. The only remaining problem is the labor cost, which is still being discussed. According to central government regulations, the selling price of gold jewelry, in addition to the balance exchange listing price, is subject to an additional 40% for business expenses and 20% for legal profits. However, including labor costs, it should not exceed 92%. Now Shanghai requests 100%, which is not much different from the central government regulations, so the issue of resuming business can generally be considered resolved.</p>
<h3>Visiting Shelters in Wind and Snow: Many Refugees Cry "Not Enough to Eat," Kneel and Beg to Go Out; Dredging of Bingdong Puhuitang Halted</h3>
<p>[Our Paper's Report] Amidst continuous wind and snow, the Winter Relief Association is intensifying its efforts to shelter refugees and is distributing warm clothing in various districts. Mobile porridge distribution vehicles were also dispatched yesterday to supplement the inadequate supply at various porridge stations. The Relief Association's Deputy Director and Director of the Social Affairs Bureau, Wu Kaixian, along with Yuan Wenzhang, Deputy Leader of the Inspection and Distribution Group and Director of the Fourth Division of the Social Affairs Bureau, and reporters from various newspapers, visited the Third Labor Relief Shelter and the First and Second Relief Shelters yesterday morning.</p>
<p>The Third Labor Relief Shelter is located at No. 1 Zhongshan Road Bridge and houses 250 refugees. They are tasked with dredging Puhuitang and are accommodated in newly built thatched sheds. The refugees at the shelters are provided with two dou of rice per person per month. Due to the need for manual labor, the working refugees are specially allocated 24 liang of rice per person per day. They earn 15,000 yuan for every cubic meter of earth they excavate. If they work hard, they can excavate two cubic meters a day. However, in this open field where the cold wind cuts like a knife, working barefoot in the river is a miserable task. Yesterday, due to the severe cold, the river was full of ice, and the excavation work was halted.</p>
<p>The First Relief Shelter is located at the site of the former Disabled Persons' Home next to Guanshengyuan Farm in Caohejing. It currently houses 735 able-bodied refugees and 379 orphaned children, totaling 1,114 people. The Second Relief Shelter is located within the Shengsheng Pasture on the Shanghai-Minhang Road and houses 910 elderly, weak, women, and children. When Director Wu visited, many refugees cried, "Not enough to eat!" Some even knelt and wept, begging to be allowed to leave. Director Wu instructed the management personnel of each shelter that, going forward, representatives elected by the refugees should participate in the rice measuring process during cooking.</p>
<p>Extreme Cold Breaks Records: Temperature Below Freezing All Day</p>
<p>Under the influence of the Siberian cold wave, the weather in the city yesterday was frigid all day, with temperatures consistently below freezing. According to meteorological reports, the center of the cold wave has gradually reached the lower reaches of the Yangtze River, causing the city's temperature to break new cold records. The highest temperature was only 28.8 degrees Fahrenheit, equivalent to minus 1.8 degrees Celsius, and the lowest was only 24 degrees Fahrenheit, equivalent to minus 4.3 degrees Celsius. The northwest wind howled, with a force of four, and this extremely cold weather is expected to last for several days. However, with the center of the cold wave directly hitting Shanghai, the weather today will be even colder than yesterday. The weather forecast is as follows: Yellow Sea: Cloudy and icy, haze, moderate north wind, medium waves. Central China: Cloudy to overcast, cold haze, local snow or fog, fog in the morning and evening, brisk north wind. Shanghai: Cloudy to overcast, cold and icy, haze, brisk northwest to north wind, light fog in the morning and evening. East China Sea: Overcast, cold, rain or drizzle along the coast, strong north wind, rain around the southeast and Kyushu, huge waves, turbulent waves around Taiwan.</p>
<h3>Social Affairs Bureau Determined to Ban Dancing: Extension Requests Will Not Be Considered</h3>
<p>[Our Paper's Report] According to the regulations for implementing the ban on dancing, half of the city's 29 dance halls should be eliminated by lottery by the end of this month and close down by the end of March. The remaining dance halls will all be closed by the end of September. Social Affairs Bureau Director Wu stated his determination to ban dancing yesterday, indicating that he would not consider the requests from dance hall operators and dancers who held a meeting recently to request an extension of the lottery. The Social Affairs Bureau is determined to implement the central government's measures. Regarding the lottery, the dance hall industry association was previously instructed to handle it themselves, with the Social Affairs Bureau sending personnel to supervise. With the deadline approaching, if the dance hall operators refuse to hold the lottery by then, the Social Affairs Bureau will draw lots on the 31st at the bureau to determine which dance halls should be eliminated and order them to close by the end of March.</p>
<h3>Vegetable Market Destroyed by Fire, Ground Goods Businesses Have No Shelter: Request for Reconstruction Rejected by City Government</h3>
<p>[Our Paper's Report] After the Central Vegetable Market in the Zhabei West District of the city was destroyed by fire, the centralized placement of vegetables has become very difficult. With the arrival of severe winter and no shelter, the vegetables are freezing. The person in charge of the association submitted a document to the City Government requesting permission to build tiled houses on the original site. The City Government convened a meeting of relevant agencies on the afternoon of the day before yesterday at 3:00 PM, chaired by City Government Counselor Wang Zhaoquan, with the participation of Public Works Bureau Director Zhao Zukang, as well as representatives from the Social Affairs Bureau, Land Administration Bureau, Education Bureau, Zhabei West District Planning Committee, and more than a dozen others. The meeting resolved that the request to rebuild tiled houses was absolutely unacceptable. There are two reasons: It conflicts with urban planning. The Zhabei West District has been designated as an urban planning demonstration area, and the original site of the Central Vegetable Market has been designated as a prime residential area, so the construction of a vegetable market will not be allowed. Land ownership is unclear. The land rights of the site are not owned by the market, and the owner has the right to reclaim it, so the City Government cannot issue a construction permit. However, the City Government authorities, because the area is a centralized vegetable distribution area in the city, and to avoid affecting vegetable prices, has specially sought a plot of public land in Caojiadu through the Land Administration Bureau for the construction of a market. However, it must be approved by the Council and submitted to the Executive Yuan for approval. However, there are many requests for the use of the public land in Caojiadu from various departments, and the meeting resolved to ask Mayor Wu to grant special approval.</p>
<p>Temporary Permission to Build Thatched Houses</p>
<p>Furthermore, the rental procedures for the above items will take one or two months to complete, and construction will also take a considerable amount of time. The Central Market has indicated that it will not be able to wait. The association has now decided to allow the immediate construction of several thatched houses on the approved land to store vegetables. However, once the rental procedures for the public land in Caojiadu are completed, they will be immediately demolished to avoid hindering the city's urban planning.</p>
<h3>Little Tiger at Tea Shop Valued at 50 Million</h3>
<p>[Our Paper's Report] Chen Li's little tiger at Datong Tea Shop at No. 165 Jinling Middle Road has not yet been sold. When reporters visited yesterday, it was curled up in a corner of the cage with its eyes closed, looking quite languid.</p>
<p>This pair of little tigers was brought to Shanghai by a Huizhou man who hunted them in the mountains and fields for consignment sales. Since the news was published in the newspaper, many people have come to see them, and there has been no shortage of people who want to buy them. Several customers are willing to pay around 20 million yuan, and a foreigner is willing to pay 50 US dollars, but the tiger owner is asking for 50 million yuan, and the difference between the two sides is too great, so no deal has been reached. According to the shop assistant at the tea shop, Hu Wenhu, the owner of Wan Jin You, once sent someone to take a look. Zhang Daqian, a famous painter of tigers, also came to "appreciate" them himself. He thought the tiger was too small and not qualified to be painted. The skin color of the little tiger is similar to that of a "bamboo joint cat" and does not look very beautiful. Datong Tea Shop borrowed a large iron cage from the City God Temple Zoo yesterday, and will move it from the original small wooden cage starting today. The shop assistants at the tea shop also take it out of the cage every night and play with it on a chain. It is said that as long as you don't anger it, the little tiger won't bite.</p>
<p>Hu Wenhu Sent Someone to Take a Look; Zhang Daqian Thought It Was Not Good Enough to Paint</p>
<h3>Campaign for National Reconstruction Energetically Held All Day</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Kuomintang, in order to strengthen the mobilization campaign for national reconstruction, despite yesterday being Sunday, the Publicity Department, led by Director Tan, personally led more than 100 colleagues from the entire propaganda team, specially equipped with two large trucks, divided into two groups for costumed propaganda and speeches, and departed from morning to night to various districts of the city to carry out propaganda, When the car passed Nanjing Road, it shouted slogans. When it reached Minguo Road, a band from the Municipal Children's Education Institute participated. The propaganda team of the team performed street dramas about the atrocities of the Communist bandits in more than a dozen places such as Xinzha Road and Changle Road. The plot was realistic and the audience was moved. The speech team went to theaters such as Nanjing, Huguang, Penglai, and Gongwutai to give simple speeches, and the audience was moved. Especially after the speech at the Xinhua Dance Hall, the whole venue sang the March of the Volunteers, and the atmosphere was tense and enthusiastic.</p>
<h3>The Day the Cherry Blossoms are in Full Bloom Will Likely Be the Day the Enemy Leaders are Convicted: Final Debate Session Can Be Held This Week; Mei Ruao Flies to Tokyo This Morning to Resume His Post</h3>
<p>Mr. Mei Ruao, the representative judge of our country stationed at the Far East International Tribunal, returned to the country a week ago to report on his work and has been approved to fly to Tokyo on a Northwest Airlines flight at 7:00 this morning to resume his post. According to Mr. Mei, who told reporters yesterday: The "Final Debate Session" of the Far East International Tribunal can be held this week. The prosecutors and defendants will each submit and read their prepared "Comprehensive Arguments" to the court. These arguments are an analysis and review of all the documents and court records accepted by the court since the trial began 20 months ago, and each will make judgments and debate with each other. It not only summarizes the facts, but also involves legal issues. Most of the arguments have been completed and exchanged between the two parties for review in advance so that they can confront each other and avoid irrelevant topics. This attitude is truly fair and enlightened, truly "gentlemanly in their disputes."</p>
<p>Deliberation Meeting · Requires More Time</p>
<p>Mr. Mei predicts that the comprehensive arguments of both parties will be more than 3,000 pages long and will take about four weeks to complete. After the debate session ends, the public trial will end, followed by the deliberation meeting of the eleven judges to determine the sentence of the 25 defendants and draft the verdict, and then schedule a sentencing date. The court will also announce its adjournment. When asked by reporters how long the deliberation meeting would take during the adjournment period and when the formal sentencing would begin, Mr. Mei replied: I cannot make a definitive prediction on this matter at this time. The Nuremberg International Tribunal's judges' meeting only took 29 days, but the Tokyo case is complex, involves a longer period of time, and has more defendants, and the number of documents and court records is more than twice that of Nuremberg, so the deliberation meeting in Tokyo will be longer than in Nuremberg. This can be asserted. However, according to my personal prediction, around April of this year, the day the cherry blossoms are in full bloom in Ying, will likely be the day the enemy leaders are convicted.</p>
<p>Eradicate Aggression · Promote Peace</p>
<p>When asked again about the approximate sentences of the future convicts and how many of them could be sentenced to death, Mr. Mei replied that, according to general judicial practice, judges should not comment on pending cases, and especially should not make any predictions about the outcome of the trial. However, the Far East International Tribunal does not apply "free conviction" but purely adopts "material evidence doctrine", so the judges will not pay attention to the arbitrary propaganda of both parties, but for war criminals with obvious crimes and conclusive evidence, they will not allow them to escape the solemn international legal justice trial. Finally, Mr. Mei told reporters in a firm tone: The purpose of the Tokyo trial is not only the life and death sentences of 25 Class A war criminals in Japan, but also to establish a new principle of international law to eradicate international aggression and help promote lasting world peace. From this point of view, although the Tokyo trial consumes a lot of human and financial resources, it has great historical significance and a sacred mission.</p>
<h3>Rehabilitation Service for the Wounded and Disabled: Adding Mechanical Woodworking Classes</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Rehabilitation Service for the Wounded and Disabled, located at No. 80 Hualong Road, has now registered 62 wounded and disabled citizens. In addition to referring the wounded and disabled to municipal hospitals for treatment, the agency also attaches great importance to job referrals and vocational training. Its purpose is to enable the wounded and disabled to become self-reliant and self-sustaining. It has organized vocational training classes for the wounded and disabled, one at the Nan Shi Christian Benefit Society and one in a private home. The above two classes are both centered on sewing. Recently, it has jointly established mechanical and woodworking classes with Jinhua Vocational School, which are now ready and can begin training.</p>
<h3>Three Workers Arrested for Inciting Labor Strikes at Woolen Mills</h3>
<p>Workers from seven woolen mills, including Zhenfeng, in the city, went on strike starting on the 22nd due to the issue of year-end bonuses. After investigation by the security authorities, it was found that five workers from these factories, including Wang Kun, Wang Yihua, Lan Caihong, Hui Genbao, and Xu Shunfu, were members of the Communist Party who coerced the workers and attempted to incite labor strikes. They were arrested on the night before last night. Three criminals, Wang Kun, Wang Yihua, and Lan Caihong, were captured. The remaining two criminals, Hui Genbao and Xu Shunfu, are at large and are being wanted by the authorities.</p>
<h3>Escape From Jiangwan Police Station by Drug Offender</h3>
<p>[Our Paper's Report] The Jiangwan Police Station recently arrested a drug dealer and illegal arms possessor, Wu Qinghai (30 years old, Henan native), and detained him in the branch's detention center. Unexpectedly, at around 0:00 yesterday morning, he took advantage of a moment of carelessness and escaped without a trace. After being discovered, he is now being pursued.</p>
<h3>15,000 Tons of Huainan Coal Arrives</h3>

<h3>International Hotel Manager Returns from Inspection Trip: Talks About the Latest Developments in the Hotel Industry in Europe and the United States</h3>
<p>[Our Paper's Report] Mr. Lin Mianzhi, manager of the International Hotel, recently toured various European and American countries at the invitation of the World Travel Industry Association and the American Travel Industry Association to inspect the hotel facilities and business conditions, lasting for four months. Mr. Lin returned to Shanghai a few days ago and told reporters yesterday about his impressions of this trip: In the United States, any business is operated on a large scale, and hotels are no exception. For example, the largest Stevens Hotel has more than 3,000 rooms. The hotel itself is like a small city, with all the necessities of life. Ordinary hotels have about 500 to 2,000 rooms, and the smallest ones are at least 150 rooms. At the same time, branch hotels belonging to the same organization are located all over the country, almost similar to the trust system in commerce. The excellent management and equipment are self-evident, and efficiency is especially emphasized. For example, fee collection uses specially designed machines that can issue bills within seconds of any consumption behavior of the passenger. Hotel doors are mostly automatically opened and closed using infrared principles.</p>
<p>The United States Lacks Manpower, Europe Lacks Food</p>
<p>However, in terms of service, because the United States lacks manpower, it is not as thoughtful as the hotels in our country. Recently, two things about the hotel industry in the United States are worth mentioning. One is that the number of mobile hotels built along highways is increasing. These mobile hotels attract many travelers because of their convenience and comfort, which greatly affects the business of formal hotels. The second is that there is a growing shortage of culinary talents in hotels, which those in charge are quite worried about.</p>
<p>In Europe, the devastation of the war has not yet been fully restored, and at the same time, food is scarce and the rationing system is strictly enforced, so the equipment and supplies of hotels are worse than those in the United States. London is especially bad. However, its prices are the highest in the world, with first-class hotels charging a room rate of 5 to 10 pounds per day.</p>
<p>Strict Organization of Associations, Spirit Worthy of Emulation</p>
<p>Mr. Lin finally expressed his impressions in several points: The hotel industry is part of the travel industry. The governments of European and American countries provide assistance and cooperation to the hotel industry. If our country wants to develop the travel industry and attract foreign investment, the government should also support the hotel industry. The associations of the travel industry in Europe and the United States are very well-organized, and members can cooperate sincerely and seek common development. Their spirit is especially worthy of our people's emulation. European and American countries do not have any contempt for hotel service personnel. The traditional concept in our country is completely the opposite, so young people with good qualifications and high abilities are unwilling to work in hotels, resulting in a lack of talent and difficulty in development. This kind of concept must be changed.</p>
<h3>Police Officer Loses Hat, Jumps Off Vehicle and Dies</h3>
<p>[Our Paper's Report] Two police officers from the City Police Department's Mobile Vehicle Team, one named Tan Pingxin, badge number 3144, and one named Jin Hongkun (22 years old, Shandong native), were on vacation yesterday. They went to Longhua for a day of leisure. When they were walking to the Nantuo of Jingji Bridge on Xujiahui Road, the two police officers stopped a truck and jumped on it, heading south quickly. When they reached Xietu Road, Jin's police cap was blown off by the wind. In a moment of anxiety, before the driver could brake, he jumped off the vehicle and accidentally fell to the ground, suffering a concussion. When the driver Wang Zhenxing stopped to check, he had already died. Later, the police officers on duty arrived and took the witness Tan Pingxin and Wang Zhenxing to the Xujiahui Police Station for questioning to verify the matter.</p>
<h3>Sworn Brother Steals, Detained for Unequal Distribution of Loot</h3>
<p>[Our Paper's Report] The Yue Dong Coal Briquette Factory at No. 361 Yichang Road lost five dan of foreign yuan car core iron on the evening of the 2nd of this month. The next morning, after discovering it, they reported it to the Putuo Road Police Station, which sent police officers to investigate in all directions, but to no avail. At about 10 p.m. the night before last, three police officers were patrolling in the Yichang Road area when they saw several people arguing on the side of the road. After questioning them, the police brought them all to the branch station. According to their confession, Meng Hanzhen, Zhang Asan, Zhang Asi, Wei Changhuai, Jiang Yuehua, and others are all sworn brothers. Meng is a worker at the Yue Dong Factory, and it was Meng who initiated and conspired to steal five dan of foreign yuan car core iron from the factory and sell it to Yao Qiaochun, who runs a second-hand goods business on the side of Xikang Road Suzhou Road, for 7.5 million yuan. Recently, due to the unequal distribution of the loot, a dispute arose. Section Chief Zhu ordered the police to arrest Yao Qiaochun and confiscate the stolen goods, and plans to send the thieves to the District Prosecutor's Office to be investigated according to law.</p>

<h3>Adjusting the Body and Mind of Tuberculosis Patients: The Patient Rehabilitation Workshop Opens, and the Memorial Tablet of the Late Director of the Tuberculosis Hospital is Unveiled Simultaneously</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] Based on 30 years of experience in the American medical community, a "Patient Rehabilitation Workshop," recognized as beneficial for tuberculosis patients to regain their health after recovery, has been established at the Shanghai Anti-Tuberculosis Association's First Tuberculosis Hospital on Hongqiao Road. Yesterday at noon, the hospital held the workshop's opening ceremony and unveiled the memorial tablet for Dr. Haysen De, the founder of the Anti-Tuberculosis Association and the late director of the Tuberculosis Hospital.</p>
<p>The "Patient Rehabilitation Workshop" is a craft workshop for tuberculosis patients who are either extremely weak or have recovered, providing a way to adjust their body and mind. It not only allows those who have recovered to continue to rest but also provides mental comfort to the patients. As everyone knows, people with tuberculosis are most afraid of psychological fear and anxiety.</p>
<p>According to a 23-year statistical result from the international medical community, 50% of recovered tuberculosis patients who were discharged from the hospital died due to recurrence of the original disease within six to eighteen months. Later, the rehabilitation workshop was established, allowing those patients who were originally going to be discharged to remain in the hospital and be given work. On the one hand, they could do some light manual work, and on the other hand, they could still receive care from the hospital and rest peacefully. After two or three years of this, they would be discharged again. Within five years, only ten out of one hundred people died. There were also students who stayed in the workshop even longer. After being discharged, an investigation showed that only three out of one hundred people died within five years, which is the same as the general mortality rate. Therefore, they believe this work is absolutely effective. They would rather have patients stay in the hospital for a few more years than waste the time, energy, and money spent in the past few years.</p>
<p>Rest Immediately When Feeling Weak</p>
<p>Ouyang Jingge, the current director of the First Tuberculosis Hospital, was sponsored by the American branch of the Shanghai Anti-Tuberculosis Association to conduct a study in the United States. After fourteen months in the United States, he brought this new method back to China and immediately implemented it. Currently, there are more than 20 people participating in the work in the Tuberculosis Hospital, and the products are also quite exquisite, including wool knitwear, small toys, and various "Hhncon" brand lighters self-made under the leadership of engineer Liang Chao. They are already being sold on the market. In the future, they plan to sell more products to supplement the hospital's expenses. The patients work for a maximum of one or two hours a day, stopping to rest as soon as they feel weak. Everyone takes turns working. The Rehabilitation Workshop hopes that people from all walks of life can donate old sewing machines and various handcraft tools so that patients can take this opportunity to learn more skills.</p>
<p>Credit Should Be Given to Dr. Haysen De</p>
<p>As for the major work of tuberculosis prevention, today's progress in China must be credited to American Dr. Haysen De. Yesterday, before the unveiling ceremony of the memorial tablet, Dr. Fu Wen, on behalf of Yan Huiqing, the president of the Anti-Tuberculosis Association (who did not attend due to a cold), reported on Dr. Hay's life, briefly stating that Dr. Haysen De had served in Shanghai before the Sino-Japanese War. He paid special attention to the treatment of leprosy, which few people were willing to do, and cooperated with Dr. Ouyang at that time. When the war broke out in Shanghai, Dr. Haysen saw that the elderly, sick, and tuberculosis patients in the refugee camps were the most distressed and no one paid attention to them. Therefore, he established an Anti-Tuberculosis Association on Jiqi Road, followed by a Tuberculosis Hospital in a hospital on Bailinan Road. At that time, he received assistance from Shi Zhaoji, the honorary president of the association, and the American Red Cross Children's Welfare Committee, allowing more than 200 patients to receive free treatment.</p>
<p>Unfortunately Died After Being Imprisoned by the Enemy</p>
<p>Haysen held three important positions: Secretary-General of the Anti-Tuberculosis Association, Director of the Tuberculosis Hospital, and Medical Designer. Later, he also ran the Second Hospital at Jiliang Institute on Yuyuan Road. On December 8th, when the Pacific War broke out, the Bailinan Road Hospital could not exist. Fortunately, Dr. Haysen received donations of about one million yuan from all walks of life and bought the current site on Hongqiao Road, moving all the patients from the Bailinan Road Hospital in. Unfortunately, Dr. Haysen was later imprisoned by the enemy in a concentration camp and died of illness at the Tongren Hospital. Dr. Fu concluded, "Our commemoration of Dr. Haysen cannot be expressed by just a copper tablet. The promotion of tuberculosis prevention and the expansion of the Tuberculosis Hospital is the best expression of commemorating Dr. Haysen."</p>
<p>The Latest Fluoroscope Installed on a Car</p>
<p>Dr. Ouyang brought back a new fluoroscope donated by the United States on this trip back to China, which will be installed on a car and used to screen citizens everywhere to prevent tuberculosis or treat it early, and can screen 600 people every day. Dr. Shi Zhaoji of the American branch of the Anti-Tuberculosis Association also launched a fundraising campaign in the United States and has already obtained 50,000 US dollars, which will be used to expand the wards of the First Hospital in the future. The hospital's wards are very cheap, with first-class including daily meals and other expenses costing 300,000 yuan per day, and there are also half-price and completely free options, some of which are subsidized by the Health Bureau. Also, Dr. Fangji, an American surgeon who worked with Dr. Haysen in the early days, still provides free medical care for the Tuberculosis Hospital, without taking any travel expenses.</p>
<p>Yesterday's unveiling was done by Dr. Haysen's eldest daughter, who is also a doctor and works for the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA), and his second daughter, who is a pharmacist. Mrs. Haysen is currently in the United States and also helped Dr. Haysen participate in the work at that time. It can be said that the whole family is working for the benefit of China.</p>

<h3>The Misfortunes of Overseas Chinese in Java: They Need Self-Help and Assistance from the Motherland's Government</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Our Newspaper in Batavia, Java, 14th] According to historical records, overseas Chinese first developed in the Dutch East Indies. Those of us who have lived in Batavia for many years deeply know that many of the overseas Chinese residing in Batavia are already sixth-generation descendants, and some even have eight or nine generations. Our country has never had an immigration policy. Overseas Chinese who leave their hometowns and drift around like duckweed all rely on the assistance of fellow villagers and relatives, or the "greetings" of relatives and friends. After finally arriving in the place of residence, they are mostly apprentices and coolies, always inseparable from poverty and disease. After a long period of hard work and frugality, very few are fortunate enough to start a family and create a business, and there are many who unfortunately die in a foreign land. On the whole, the majority of overseas Chinese are laborers and the poor, accounting for eight or nine out of ten. The millionaires with huge wealth are still as rare as morning stars. Our domestic compatriots must first have such an understanding of overseas Chinese and must not associate the two concepts of overseas Chinese and rich businessmen together.</p>
<p>Looking further, many successful overseas Chinese have accumulated mostly commercial capital. The businesses operated by overseas Chinese (such as the sugar industry of Sampo Kong Huang Jianyuan) are dependent on the local suzerain countries and are limited by colonial policies and the lack of social and national legal protection. Their capital can never be transformed into modern industrial capital. The lessons learned from the facts of the past few decades show that they are only declining and going bankrupt, and never flourishing. We must not forget the wealthy overseas Chinese in Java before the war, and we must point out this fundamental misfortune.</p>
<p>The "Middleman" Status is Shaken</p>
<p>Java has the largest population and highest density of overseas Chinese. On this island, whether in remote mountains or remote areas, there are "Taron" (small stores selling daily necessities) of overseas Chinese, which are closest to the native Indonesians. The economic status of overseas Chinese is sufficient to control the entire economic life of Indonesians. Overseas Chinese are the "middlemen" between Indonesians and the people of the Dutch ruling country. Overseas Chinese collect local products and sell daily necessities, earning limited profits.</p>
<p>Since the Indonesian nation loudly shouted "Merdeka" (Independence), our overseas Chinese have first fallen into an environment of endless war and low war clouds. As a result of the Indonesian-Dutch conflict, overseas Chinese have suffered casualties and property losses in the cracks, and many have even entered the "abyss of destruction." Those who are fortunate enough not to suffer from the war have had their status as "middlemen" fundamentally shaken due to the implementation of the Dutch control policy and the rise of the Indonesian people's national economic policy. Moreover, after the three-year occupation of the Japanese invaders, they tried their best to provoke and incite the Indonesians. The Indonesians completely erased our past great achievements in reclaiming wasteland and actually regarded overseas Chinese as "bloodsuckers," "Jews," and "exploitative classes," creating a widespread anti-Chinese atmosphere and formulating various laws that were unfavorable to overseas Chinese. The troops were undisciplined, and the people were inherently brutal, regarding murder and looting as commonplace.</p>
<p>In addition, the overseas Chinese society has always been divided, engaging in intrigue, and is now in a state of semi-split. The divisions of native place and gang, and the gap between "left-leaning elements" and "party groups." Recently, in Batavia, the matter of responding to the suppression of the rebellion telegram caused a lot of trouble and gloom. To this day, both sides are still continuing to wage a pen war. This makes it impossible for overseas Chinese to immediately unite to deal with the crisis in the face of a major disaster, and therefore, the external forces are weakened invisibly.</p>
<p>These various misfortunes are enough to plunge overseas Chinese into the eighteenth level of hell. The reporter looks at the changes in the world and foresees the future. I cannot help but feel worried about the unfortunate multiple misfortunes of overseas Chinese in the East Indies!</p>
<p>Wen Jingduo and Others Become Indonesian Citizens</p>
<p>The government of the motherland has always cared about overseas Chinese and valued them. Our national father even called an overseas Chinese "the mother of revolution." From the Xinhai Revolution to the July 7th Anti-Japanese War, overseas Chinese have always been the great supply station for the motherland. Especially since the Anti-Japanese War, because overseas Chinese have borne almost one-fourth of the central government's annual anti-war expenditure in the first three years of the Anti-Japanese War, the Anti-Japanese War has also raised the overseas Chinese's right to speak in the politics of the motherland. However, after the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, the outbreak of civil strife in the motherland gave overseas Chinese a great disappointment. Overseas Chinese harbored wishful thinking, thinking that the day of the victory of the motherland's Anti-Japanese War would be the time for overseas Chinese to stand up and be proud. In fact, since the victory, the entire crisis of overseas Chinese has deepened day by day. On the one hand, it is because the government of the motherland does not have a rapid, clear, and vigorous foreign policy and active and effective measures. On the other hand, it is because some impure-minded people have infiltrated all levels of overseas Chinese society, making unreasonable attacks on the government of the motherland and doing their best to provoke, which has caused overseas Chinese to move towards a "centrifugal" movement due to disappointment and resentment towards the motherland. Many overseas Chinese are even considering whether to simply join Indonesian citizenship. Today, Wen Jingduo (football star, graduated from Jinan University), Xiao Yucan (now an Indonesian cabinet member) and others have officially joined Indonesian citizenship and are doing their best to destroy overseas Chinese in the interior of Java.</p>
<p>Overseas Chinese Self-Help is Imminent</p>
<p>We believe that the most urgent problem facing us is the problem of overseas Chinese self-help. We know that it is difficult to send troops to protect overseas Chinese, not to mention that it is difficult to do in fact. Even if the government is willing to do so, the negative effect will definitely outweigh the positive effect. Large-scale evacuation of overseas Chinese is even more impossible, and the objective environment does not allow it. Where should overseas Chinese students who have never stepped into the country be evacuated to? In this view, there is no other way than overseas Chinese self-help and the assistance of the motherland's government.</p>
<p>For the sake of the nation and the overseas Chinese, the commercial capital of overseas Chinese should be quickly transformed into the independent industrial capital of the motherland. What we mean is not to advocate that the small and medium-sized capitalists of overseas Chinese should be uprooted, nor do we expect to advocate the complete withdrawal of overseas Chinese overnight. But at the very least, we dare to say that overseas Chinese cannot sit and wait for death. They should raise their vigilance and step into participating in the production of the motherland, which is the way out and has a future. However, the businesses operated by overseas Chinese here are mostly not modern organizations, and the modern production technology of overseas Chinese talents is still very young. The government of the motherland should have a unified guiding agency to handle the affairs of overseas Chinese returning to the country to invest, and the government should also legislate to guarantee the profits of overseas Chinese investment. In this way, overseas Chinese capital will definitely flow back continuously.</p>
<p>Forming a Security Team Deters Thugs</p>
<p>Secondly, we need to talk about the emergency rescue of overseas Chinese. Now, overseas Chinese security teams have been established one after another in the Dutch-occupied areas. Since its establishment, it has been able to perform its sacred duties quite well. In places where overseas Chinese security teams are stationed, Indonesian thugs have been slightly deterred than before. This is what we are comforted by. I still remember that a week ago, in Puvolati Port, because there were no Dutch troops stationed there, more than 100 thugs broke into the city. There were more than 500 overseas Chinese in the port. They specially sent representatives to request the security team to go to the port to station. The security team complied with the request of the overseas Chinese and specially sent a squad of seven people, including a squad leader, to jointly protect the local youth of 20 people. When the team had just arrived at the port, the thugs suddenly attacked the security team. The security team bravely fought back, and the two sides opened fire for two hours. The thugs finally collapsed and retreated. An investigation of the actual situation revealed that security team member Liu Jinlong heroically died. The thugs left three bodies, two were Indonesians and one was a Japanese bandit. Security team member Liu's heroic sacrifice was made to protect the lives and property of overseas Chinese, and Liu can undoubtedly be called a "national hero." At the same time, it is enough to prove that the overseas Chinese security team can indeed exert its power to protect overseas Chinese.</p>
<p>Last month, Consul Niu Shuqu went to various parts of Central Java to inspect the situation of overseas Chinese and witnessed the pain of overseas Chinese being exiled and concentrated and the suffering of being taken advantage of. These places are all Indonesian Republics, and the responsibility cannot be pushed to the Dutch.</p>
<p>Therefore, Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Ye Gongchao advocated that security teams should also be established in the Indonesian Republic. This request is the most timely and appropriate and must be promoted to be realized as soon as possible. The general opinion here is that the overseas Chinese in the interior currently suffer the deepest pain. The Indonesian government uses the excuse to protect them, and the overseas Chinese are concentrated. Once the overseas Chinese are concentrated, not only are all their properties burned and looted by Indonesian thugs, but the lives of the overseas Chinese are also completely lost in this unplanned concentration. The overseas Chinese are either killed on the way, or die of disease and starvation in the mountain caves. The tragic situation is unbearable to imagine. Since many facts have proven that the lives and properties of overseas Chinese near the war zone are not guaranteed at all, the Indonesian authorities' refusal to allow overseas Chinese to form their own security teams the other day can be said to be completely unreasonable. We hope that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the motherland should strive for it with the Indonesian authorities in order to quickly promote its realization.</p>
<p>Repeated Orders Are of No Use</p>
<p>Indonesian President Sukarno recently exhorted the people to strictly abide by national discipline, which is worthy of attention and comfort. However, as President Sukarno himself said, if there is no action to prove what he said to the people, it will not help the facts.</p>
<p>But since the world-shaking Wendeng tragedy occurred, the Indonesian authorities have shown superficial remorse and have repeatedly ordered the people to abide by the law and protect overseas Chinese, and have guaranteed to our country that they will punish the murderers and compensate. But to this day, they have not detained a single principal offender or executed a single thug. It is because these words and guarantees have no action to prove, so when the Dutch "guard action" was launched this time, Indonesian thugs became even more unscrupulous and continued to massacre and burn our overseas Chinese.</p>
<p>The United Nations Security Council's Three-Nation Committee, which is attracting worldwide attention, seems to have not achieved any results after busy work. We have long believed that the Security Council's mediation of the Indonesian-Dutch dispute is purely to "do its best" and perfunctorily deal with both Indonesia and the Netherlands. The Dutch side seems to have never attached importance to the Security Council's resolutions from the beginning, although it does not dare to disobey the "good intentions" of some major countries too much. The Indonesian side, on the other hand, harbors wishful thinking, thinking that international pressure can make the Netherlands retreat. Looking at these three aspects of behavior, people can foresee that the situation in Indonesia will not be clear in the foreseeable future. It is only pitiful that our overseas Chinese who are drifting in the interior of Java do not know when they will be able to escape the sea of ​​suffering. (Special Correspondent Huang Haizhen)</p>

<h3>Spring Interlude: Wuyuan Yellow Plum Blossoms Bloom in the Cold</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Wuyuan, 22nd] The most precious plum species in our county are the green plum blossoms of Longxi and the yellow plum blossoms of Rencun. Yesterday, I made a special trip to Rencun to explore the plum blossoms. When I arrived at the garden of the old residence of the Hu family in Renli, the yellow plum blossoms leaning against a corner of the crumbling wall already had amber-colored millet grains, blooming in the cold, like stars dotted between the sturdy branches. The age of the plum tree is about 100 years or more, and the crown is like a cover, curved and graceful. Except that the pistils are yellow, the appearance of the tree is like an old plum tree, with no different differences. It is reported that this plum is dark yellow in color and is called yellow plum blossom. Its petals are also very different from wax plum blossoms. Among the plum species, it is a famous and precious product like green plum blossom. Ordinary species are mostly red and white, and there are not many yellow ones. Moreover, the flowering period of this plum must wait for it to bloom before the arrival of spring. The color is delicate and fresh. No matter whether spring comes early or late, the plum blossoms will also bloom in time. It is said to be the welcoming spring yellow plum blossom, which is born with spring.

<h3>Surveying the Caoling Reservoir: Possible to Irrigate 750,000 Mu</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Taipei, 22nd] Caoling in the mountains of Alishan, Chiayi, was caused by the great earthquake on December 18, 1941, and the torrential rain in August 1942, resulting in the second major collapse of the rain, which buried the Qingshui Creek Valley and drowned it into a lake, which has been five years now. The dam is about 200 meters high, the storage capacity is about 150 million cubic meters, and the water surface is more than 560 meters above sea level. This is a lake in the mountains. From the Alishan Railway Crossroads Station, you can see a corner of the Caoling Reservoir. This is a miracle of Taiwan's geography. According to Professor Jin Cheng of the Department of Civil Engineering of Taiwan University, who returned from the survey, the area may generate 30,000 to 40,000 KW of electricity and irrigate 50,000 A (each A is 15 mu). However, the remaining mountain peaks after the collapse of the dam and the selection of the water diversion tunnel line, including geological, hydrological, engineering and other issues, as well as the economics of utilization, need to be considered. Professor Jin will continue to conduct detailed observation and research this summer for water conservancy construction.</p>
<h3>Winter Relief: Soliciting One Sheng of Rice Movement</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Wujin, 24th] The Winter Relief Association of our county has launched a fundraising and clothing donation movement for winter relief, which has achieved excellent results. The first phase of rice voucher distribution began on the 24th. Recently, the association launched a one-sheng rice movement. Based on the spirit of "helping others is the source of happiness", it has been widely launched, hoping to gather small amounts into large amounts to help the poor. The donation team is organized by students from various schools. Each household is expected to donate one sheng of rice as a principle, and the more the better. For households with several households, donations are solicited on a household basis. No separate receipt will be issued, and a sign will be attached to the household. The fundraising work is scheduled to be completed in three days from the 26th to the 28th.</p>
<h3>Wujin Hengshan Bridge: Cracking Down on Bandit Dens</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Wujin, 25th] Hengshan Bridge, north of the road, is connected to Chengjing, which has always been the area where the bandits Zhang Zhiqiang and Yu Naizhang roamed. They usually distort propaganda, and the people have suffered greatly. Recently, Zhang Xingjie of the Qishuyan Self-Defense Force under its jurisdiction, smashed a bandit den in Longdang Village, about three miles south of Hengshan Bridge Town. The den was opened in the family of Mo Huanquan, one behind the stove, with the bamboo shelf moving in and out, and one on the top floor, with the floor slab opening and closing up and down. Each room is only four steps large, and the layout is only one bed, one table, and several benches. The bandit Mo Haoxi was also captured on the spot. According to the confession, there are a total of ten people participating in the same village, known as the "Ten Cadre Party." After being informed, they voluntarily guaranteed that the "Ten Cadre Party" would reform themselves to the government and would be willing to recruit their accomplices to surrender, and they issued a death penalty guarantee. From now on, they will work together to atone for their crimes and redeem their past mistakes.</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper, Zhenjiang, 24th] The Zhenchang Danyang Four Counties Suppression Headquarters ended all suppression work and handed it over to the Zhenchang Jiangfang Division Command to continue handling it. It is reported that although the Four Counties Suppression Headquarters has ended, the suppression work is still being actively promoted. The visible and invisible bandits in the nearby rural areas have mostly been gradually eliminated and can be completely wiped out before the end of this month. As for the guns distributed to the county by the Ministry of National Defense, they have now been distributed according to the actual needs of each district, so the armed forces in each township are sufficient and the local public security is also quite stable. At the same time, the Beijing-Shanghai Jiangfang Command also issued an order to all counties to complete the construction of the bunkers along the river by the end of February.</p>
<p>Sketch Map of Fuzhou-Xiamen Highway Drawn by Our Newspaper's Archives Room</p>
<h3>More Than Ten Million People Hope For Construction: Fuzhou-Xiamen Highway</h3>
<p>[Our Fuzhou Dispatch on the 15th] The Fuzhou-Xiamen Highway is the only transportation artery linking the two rich areas of eastern and southern Fujian. It was opened to traffic long before the War of Resistance. At that time, it only took a day's drive from Fuzhou on the Min River to Xiamen, the hometown of overseas Chinese, where the language is completely different. Passenger and freight transport between Fuzhou and Xiamen was half borne by this road. However, the road was closed not long after being opened to traffic due to the war. Once Jinmen, next to Xiamen, fell, this road immediately became a "blind gut." In order to prevent the enemy from taking the opportunity to invade inland, the authorities thoroughly destroyed it in the 27th year [of the Republic, i.e. 1938].</p>
<p>For the past eight years, the Fuzhou-Xiamen Road has been paralyzed. Pieces of earth have been overgrown with green grass, sections of the roadbed have been turned into farmland, bridges have collapsed, and milestones have been submerged. The same journey from Fuzhou to Xiamen takes a full five days on foot. What a profound comparison between machinery and manual labor here!</p>
<p>The Fujian provincial authorities have been clamoring to rush to repair this highway since the day after the victory of the War of Resistance. The Provincial Highway Bureau and the Construction Department have been busy preparing plans and preparing for surveying. However, as an engineering project as long as the section from Hangzhou to Yushan Station on the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway, how easy is it to carry out? Moreover, at the beginning of the post-war recovery, everything needed to be done, and the treasury funds were indeed even more empty. As a result, the plan was shelved for more than a year until the Executive Yuan's Fujian Office was established last year. After relief supplies printed with (UNRRA) arrived one after another, the call for road restoration was revived. Later, after all, due to the central government's emphasis on seeking transportation solutions and the enthusiastic assistance of UNRRA foreign engineering personnel, the "Fuzhou-Xiamen Engineering Office" was formally established, and then the arduous road restoration work began.</p>
<p>From Fuzhou to Xiamen</p>
<p>The route extends as follows: Starting from Nanmendou in Fuzhou City, passing Baihuting, Xiabei, crossing the Wulong River, landing in Xinan, passing Changkou, then crossing Xiangsi Ridge, the highest peak of the entire route, reaching Honglu, Yuxi, Jiangkou, Hanjiang Town, entering Xiaotian County, then passing Fengting, entering Huian City, exiting Xingtian, here crossing the historically famous Luoyang Bridge to reach Quanzhou (Jinjiang), then passing Qianpu, Guanqiao, Shuitou, Magang to Tong'an County, then passing Guankou, Jiaowei, Songyu across the sea to Xiamen, the entire journey is 298 kilometers (the upper half is the tea and rice producing area of Fujian, the middle half is the fruit and sugar producing area of Fujian, and the lower half is the hometown of 70% of overseas Chinese from Fujian (Tan-Quan area). From an economic point of view, the importance of this road is obviously no less than that of any other highway in other provinces). With the strong help of UNRRA materials, the total cost of road restoration at that time was budgeted at only 1.9 billion yuan. However, after several changes and the passage of time, as soon as the project started, it encountered difficulties. Until today, after a year of time and hundreds of billions of wages spent, only a small section of the road from Fuzhou to Yuxi has been opened. Under such circumstances, the public cannot help but discuss and criticize it.</p>
<p>From my previous experience of visiting railway engineering projects in other provinces, the Fuzhou-Xiamen road project is difficult to be satisfactory.</p>
<p>Highway Restoration Difficulties</p>
<p>The degree of difficulty is no less than that of a railway. What is especially admirable is that the road actually has a large number of road restoration machines. This saves much more effort than manually opening a road in those days. (According to reports, the road currently has three graders, three bulldozers, twenty-three dump trucks, five Ford trucks, three road rollers, six mechanical repair vehicles, three stone crushers, three scrapers, four pneumatic rock drills, three sheep foot rollers, three water trucks, and countless other machines. Among them, bulldozers can push 20,000 cubic feet of soil per day, and stone crushers can crush 80 or 90 large stones per day. Shaving mud like paper and crushing stones like a millstone are both very suitable). However, since the project began, it has been progressing like a snail. Outsiders cannot easily forgive this situation. I believe that the progress of a project certainly requires material resources to cooperate with manpower, but it also requires</p>
<p>Manpower Driving Material Resources</p>
<p>Machines are only machines, and funds are only funds. Those in charge must not only know how to utilize them, but also use them well and utilize them thoroughly. Otherwise, if machines, financial resources, and manpower contradict and become disconnected from each other, how can one avoid failure? The success of the rushed repair of the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway at that time relied on this point. I think the slow development of the Fuzhou-Xiamen Highway project is nothing more than this.</p>
<p>Some people in the local public say: "The Fuzhou-Xiamen Road has no hope of restoration." Others burst into scolding: "The Fuzhou-Xiamen project is a complete mess." Although the tone is somewhat fiery, they all express the feelings of hope that more than ten million people in Fujian have for the road. Indeed, the relationship between the Fuzhou-Xiamen Road and Fujian's transportation, economy, military, and politics in the future is too important. From any point of view, I hope that the colleagues in charge will step up their efforts and complete it as soon as possible. (Special Correspondent Huang Cen)</p>

<h3>Paradise in Jiangyin Shuangshan Sandbar</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch from Jiangyin on the 22nd] The sandbars belonging to Cheng [County] are located on the riverbank. The constant changes of the eastern sandbar collapsing and the western sandbar rising are truly like the changes of the sea. Outside Zhangjiagang Port in the eastern suburbs, there is a place called Shuangshan Sandbar, which is more than ten li long and six or seven li wide. There are more than 500 households, with bamboo fences and thatched houses, and it has the flavor of "a rooster's crow, a thatched cottage, a moon, footprints on a plank bridge, and frost." It is still like a peach blossom garden outside the world. This sandbar was formed eighteen years ago when the river water carried silt and was blocked by the feet of the Chang and Wu mountains, accumulating into a beach. It has been accumulating for the past ten years, hence the name Shuangshan Sandbar. It has only been reclaimed for twenty-eight years. When they first came to cultivate the land, they saw that the</p>
<p>Mud was little and black so they named it Tiebansha [Iron Board Sand]. Looking at the sandbar from across the river in Jiangnan, the sandbar in the river looks like a large black fish, so it is also called Heiyusha [Black Fish Sand]. In the 18th year of the Republic of China [1929], gentry Wu Tinglu and others raised funds and organized workers to build embankments. Here, men, women, old and young, mostly have the idea of "not knowing Wei and Jin, let alone Han." They are all dressed in homemade cloth made in Du, without permed women or men wearing leather shoes. They eat simple meals and do not ask about world affairs. They only know to work at sunrise and rest at sunset, sing songs while hitting the earth, dig ponds to drink, and till the fields for food. All day long, they are carefree and enjoy the peace of rural life.</p>
<p>All the houses on the sandbar are only six tile-roofed houses in the Lengtan of the Lu Liubao and Lu Yunbao brothers. The rest are all thatched houses. The</p>
<p>Land tax paid is very light which is of a reed nature. Each mu [Chinese acre] is only two he [Chinese pint] of rice. There are more than 10,000 mu of land, and the price is very cheap. Each mu is worth five shi [Chinese bushel] of rice. Two types of indica rice and soybeans are planted in the fields, and each has an output of three to four thousand shi each year. Secondly, cotton, peaches, and grains also have a very winter yield. Winter wheat, broad beans, and peas do not need to be fertilized and have a very good yield. There are livestock such as sheep, pigs, and cattle, as well as a small machine oil press and two soil oil presses. Women can push them and move freely. Men and women have equal work.</p>
<p>Cultural level is very low. Only Yu Qixian, a sandbar resident, has just graduated from middle school. There is not a single other middle school student. There is a national primary school in Bao, with more than 240 school-age children, but only 40 are in school. There is also a private school, with four students. It has recently been merged with the Bao school.</p>
<p>Not long ago, County Magistrate Xu went to inspect and merged the ninety-er bao into a self-governing experimental bao and organized a self-defense force. In addition to adding rifles, they used local soil cannons, bird guns, wooden sticks, and broadswords, with a gong for each jia [unit of area] for alarms, and implemented mutual assistance. In addition,</p>
<p>Building new streets, the city houses are built like bunkers, with rivers running around them. Local politics, culture, economy, and military are all concentrated together. In addition to the regular bao chief, there are two deputy bao chiefs. A self-defense force has one deputy team leader, and a farmers' association and a fish farming cooperative are also organized to control the reeds along the river. In addition to the residents' own use, most of the reeds are transported to other places by boat for sale to help production. The above plans are now being implemented in order.

<h3>Raising Funds to Fill Private Pockets Zhang Wenxi's Reputation Bankrupt Committed Suicide by Drinking Arsenic</h3>
<p>[Our Suzhou Dispatch on the 23rd] Zhang Wenxi, a teacher at the private Shouzhen Primary School in the city, recently raised funds for the school but embezzled them for his own use. Because he was warned by the school in the newspaper, he felt that his reputation was bankrupt. He committed suicide by drinking arsenic in the morning of the 21st. He was treated but was not effective and died that night. The police station is currently investigating the corpse's family.</p>
<h3>Water Tobacco Export Trade Ranks First Three Hundred Thousand People Depend on it for a Living</h3>
<p>[Our Lanzhou Dispatch on the 20th] Gansu's water tobacco has been famous throughout the country for a long time. Its heyday was as far back as the Guangxu period of the late Qing Dynasty and around the 10th year of the Republic of China [1921]. It not only ranked first in Gansu's foreign trade economically (followed by fur and then medicinal materials), but also in the national fiscal revenue, it was an important source of tax revenue among national taxes. In the past decade, it has suffered from the devastation of war, the popularity of cigarettes and cigars, and the impact of imitation planting and learning in other provinces (such as Quwo, Shanxi), forming the current state of decline. But it still has its market. In addition to the common people in various parts of the Northwest, who still buy and smoke water tobacco because it is cheaper than cigarettes and cigars (i.e., homemade cigars), before the "September 18th" Incident [1931], it could be sold far to the Northeast, Yantai, Pingjin [Beijing and Tianjin], Shanxi, Suiyuan, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Fujian, Guangdong, Jiangxi, Hunan, and even various parts of Southeast Asia. After the war, due to various obstacles (such as insufficient capital and blocked transportation), sales have declined day by day. After all, it can still be sold to Xinjiang, Shaanxi, Sichuan, Ningxia, Qinghai, Henan, Hubei, Jiangsu, etc. Even the sales volume in Shanghai alone last year (the 35th year of the Republic of China [1946]) reached 2,335,705 catties. Although it cannot be compared with the quantity of imported foreign tobacco, its excellent conditions for existence are clearly visible.</p>
<p>Water tobacco is made from tobacco leaves. The tobacco leaf is commonly known as nine-leaf rue grass. It is said that after Zhuge Liang conquered the southern barbarians, during</p>
<p>Six Expeditions to Qishan he introduced this grass to the north into Gansu. According to "Jinhu Qimo": "During the Qianlong period, Lanzhou produced tobacco seeds and used lead and copper as pipes to store water and smoke it." The so-called "pipe" is commonly known as a water tobacco pouch. The most famous are made of Guangdong silver. Noble families have silver ones, and poor people make them of bamboo and smoke them in the same way. The taste of the water leaf tobacco is sweet, mellow, fragrant, and moist, which is very different from cigarettes and cigars.</p>
<p>Due to Gansu's high altitude, low rainfall, and cold weather, tobacco leaf production areas are mostly distributed in the valleys on both sides of the river, with the Lanzhou area in the Yellow River basin and the Lintao area in the Tao River basin as the main production areas. The production area in each area depends on the tobacco leaf price and sales situation in previous years. In the 25th year of the Republic of China [1936], the tobacco leaf cultivation area was 42,000 mu, and the harvest was 3,546,000 catties. In the 30th year [1941], due to the small import of foreign tobacco, it reached 46,358 mu, and the harvest was 9,886,482 catties. Later, it declined year by year. Last year, it was only 40,065 mu, and the harvest was 7,017,938 catties. The above figures are only for the Lanzhou area (including Lanzhou, Gaolan, Yuzhong, Jingyuan, and other counties and cities), the tobacco production center, because data from other counties is difficult to obtain. It is enough to illustrate the trend of the tobacco industry's decline. If the tobacco production of the entire province is estimated, it is at least 80,000 catties or more, and the finished product is about 11 million catties.</p>
<p>Tobacco leaf varieties belong to the yellow flower species. The green tobacco, yellow tobacco, and cotton tobacco that are commonly referred to are only different in the harvest period and the raw materials used. Under normal circumstances, after the spring wheat is harvested, the empty space is used for sowing. Wait until it grows to before the frost falls in the lunar calendar, and pull it down and put it in the warehouse. This is called green leaves and is used to make green tobacco silk. If the leaves turn yellow due to frost and then are cut down and put in the warehouse, it is called yellow leaves and is used to make yellow cotton tobacco silk. The yellow leaves that turn dark yellow due to the influence of climate and pests are used for making hemp tobacco silk and dry tobacco. The quality of tobacco leaves is greatly related to the components they contain. According to the test results, the usual tobacco leaf components contain 15% to 30% protein, 10% to 20% ash, 1% to 6% nicotine, 8% to 10% fiber, 2% to 8% acids, 1% ammonia, and 25% to 63% water. Except for protein, fiber, and water, which are neutral, the rest, such as acids, bases, and ash, have special properties. Smoking can avoid epidemics, aid digestion, kill insects, and relieve boredom. Avoiding epidemics is especially important. Those who live in high mountains, dense forests, and humid lands will almost lose their lives if they do not smoke.</p>
<p>Water tobacco processing begins after the tobacco leaves enter the workshop. The procedures are:</p>
<p>Grading Remove the main veins of the leaves, and then sort and dry each leaf one by one according to the size, color, thickness, and integrity. This work is commonly known as tearing tobacco leaves, and female workers and child labor are mostly hired temporarily.</p>
<p>Mixing ingredients Put the tobacco leaves into the mixing room, first spray them with boiling water, and then add the ingredients one by one. Green tobacco is mixed with gypsum, pagoda tree flowers, purple flowers, stone alkali, alum, and vegetable oil. For yellow tobacco, first spray and stir the vegetable oil evenly, and then sprinkle in turmeric powder (for dyeing), salt (for preservation), and various spices such as angelica, sweet grass, mint, chuanxiong, and atractylodes, and some also add precious borneol. Xiang...etc., mix well after mixing.</p>
<p>Pressing and bundling Put the tobacco leaves that have been mixed with the ingredients into a specially prepared rectangular solid trough made of wood, and use manual bare feet to press them into bundles of rough embryos, then use wooden boards to clip them out, cut them into three sections, and place them on a high-pressure platform, using the principle of leverage and the method of attaching weights to pulleys to press the tobacco bundles heavily until they become a whole and can be cut into silk. This kind of high pressure usually reaches a weight of 700,000 catties.</p>
<p>Cutting silk After the tobacco bundles are pressed, they are cut into silk with a specially made planing knife held by two people facing each other at both ends of the tobacco bundles, each bundle weighing 1,000 catties. The tobacco silk cut out is pressed into a hardwood box that can hold one or two taels or four taels, forming silk blocks (commonly known as bundles).</p>
<p>Air-drying After weighing each tobacco silk block, they are put on the shelf for air-drying to allow the moisture in the tobacco block to slowly evaporate. This process takes about one to two months.</p>
<p>Sealing and packaging After the tobacco blocks are air-dried, they are grouped, sealed with paper, and placed in boxes one by one. Each green tobacco block weighs about two taels, ten blocks per package, 320 packages per box, two boxes per dan [Chinese unit of weight], each dan weighs about 440 catties. Each yellow tobacco block weighs about four taels, ten blocks per package, 72 packages per box, four boxes per dan, each dan weighs about 700 catties.</p>
<p>Hemp tobacco, also known as dry tobacco, is made from the scraps and remaining stems left over from making green and yellow tobacco, with a small amount of spices added. It is mostly sold to the working class for smoking, and its smoke tastes spicy and intense.</p>
<p>In the early years of the Republic of China, there were more than 100 tobacco workshops in Lanzhou and more than 150 in Lintao. According to a survey at the end of last year, there were no more than 48 in Lanzhou and only 67 in Lintao. Comparing the annual decline, it is nothing less than a history of the decline of the tobacco industry. Gansu Province, located in the northwest corner of the country, does not have developed transportation, and its production, management methods, and sales methods adhere to the old rules. Moreover, the production cost has increased, the capital turnover is not flexible, and there is no way to improve. The loss of the tobacco industry during the war: from the 27th to the 33rd year of the Republic of China [1938-1944], 1,149,885 catties were mildewed due to the inability to transport them out. In the 29th year [1940], 400 boxes, more than 80,000 catties, were bombed and destroyed by Japanese planes near Zhennanguan while attempting to export through Hanoi, Vietnam. After the outbreak of the Pacific War, 1,600 boxes, 352,000 catties, were confiscated by the Japanese puppet government in Shanghai. When Hong Kong was captured, more than 600 boxes, 32,000 catties, were lost in shipwrecks. After the victory, 763 boxes, 87,745 catties, were submerged by the surge of the Wei River when they were first concentrated in Xianyang waiting for transport to the east. On August 9th last year, 1,799 boxes, weighing 206,885 catties, were burned by the Communists at Dangshan Station. This is still the case for those who have obtained proof of tax payment. Other direct and indirect losses are even more difficult to count. From tobacco leaf</p>
<p>Seedling cultivation in Gansu Province to the completion of finished tobacco silk, it is estimated that at least 300,000 people directly and indirectly depend on it for a living. In Lanzhou City alone, there are at least 50,000 people. If this important economic undertaking is allowed to decline day by day, leading to withering and bankruptcy, this cannot but make people wake up! And we must urgently seek ways to rescue it! Therefore, no matter the central or local government, no matter the agricultural, financial, social, fiscal, transportation and other agencies, they should all find ways to assist the survival, development, promotion, and restoration of Gansu's only economic undertaking, and jointly seek the bright future of the national economy.

<h3>Birth of the Fudan Cooperative Department; Following the Legacy Advocated by Mr. Xue Xianzhou, Unveiling a New Page in China's Cooperative Movement</h3>
<p>When mentioning the cooperative movement in China, people will immediately think of Mr. Xue Xianzhou, the father of Chinese cooperation. Thirty years ago, when the flower of the cooperative movement was blooming all over the world, China was still a desert of cooperation. It was not until the May Fourth Movement in 1919 that the tide of democracy washed over this ancient continent. The insightful Mr. Xue Xianzhou, in order to cooperate with the establishment of a democratic economy, took the lead in advocating the anti-imperialist and anti-feudal cooperative movement in China. Thus, the first cooperative bank in China was established at Fudan University in Jiangwan, Shanghai, which was the Shanghai National Cooperative Savings Bank, with the longest history and the most successful operation. Mr. Xue, on the one hand, used the opportunity of teaching to instill cooperative ideas and knowledge into students, and on the other hand, founded the "Common People Weekly" (later renamed "Common People Society") to promote the cooperative movement and advocate the spirit of cooperation, gradually expanding the cooperative movement from intellectuals to the working masses. At that time, many Fudan students were inspired and enlightened by Mr. Xue and devoted themselves to the cooperative movement. Today, many pioneers in the domestic cooperative sector, such as Wang Shiying, Chen Zhongming, and Wen Chongxin, have all benefited from Mr. Xue's teachings. They followed Mr. Xue's path and worked hard for the cooperative cause in China. In less than a generation, they had transformed the cooperative movement in China from its infancy to its development stage, from urban areas to rural areas, completing the arduous foundational work for the cooperative road in China, which is worthy of admiration.</p>
<p>Concrete Manifestation of Traditional Spirit</p>
<p>The reason why the cooperative movement in China was born at Fudan, in addition to the aforementioned advocacy of Mr. Xue Xianzhou, also has other historical factors: Fudan's innate nature carries a very strong traditional spirit of "mutual assistance" and "sacrifice." "Fudan is a big family," which has been repeatedly emphasized by the late President Li Denghui and the current President Zhang Yi, and the principle of cooperation is the combination of people, the chain of love, and the cooperative society is like a big family, which coincides with the "Fudan Spirit." In addition, cooperation is an anti-imperialist and anti-feudal democratic movement, and Fudan, facing the division of the motherland by warlords and the invasion of imperialists, has always stood on the front line of battle, which is a concrete manifestation of the spirit of "mutual assistance" and "sacrifice." Therefore, Fudan's ability to become the cradle of the cooperative movement in China is not accidental, but has its innate factors and historical background.</p>
<p>In the past, Fudan has cultivated many outstanding cooperative talents for the country, and now it continues to shoulder the sacred task of cultivating talents. In the autumn of last year (1947), Fudan established the Department of Cooperation, which is still a rare department in domestic universities. The head of this department is Mr. Chen Zhongming, who, more than twenty years ago, during his student days, founded the Fudan Common People Volunteer School. Since stepping out of Fudan's gates, Mr. Chen has always adhered to the cooperative position. Many years of work experience have given him a very optimistic belief in the future of Chinese cooperation. From his amiable attitude, it is not difficult to deduce the successful elements of running civil education in those years.</p>
<p>Research Theory Combined with Practice</p>
<p>Currently, there are a total of sixty-six students in the entire Department of Cooperation. Although the number of people is not large, they all entered victoriously after a difficult entrance examination. The most valuable thing is the harmonious relationship and serious learning among the students, which, from the perspective of outsiders, is unmatched by other departments in the school. In terms of research, they have a department-wide cooperative society, which regularly publishes academic wall newspapers to allow students to openly discuss cooperative issues. At the same time, they also organized a cooperative economic reading club, using extracurricular time to collectively read and discuss, gradually exploring from the most basic to the more advanced, combining theory with practice. In addition, they are preparing to establish a cooperative library. In addition to the department purchasing a portion of books, they are also asking pioneers in the cooperative sector to donate. Mr. Wu Yuzhang, a veteran of the cooperative sector in Sichuan, has generously donated a portion of his library, about nearly ten thousand volumes, which will be shipped to the school. After the school allocates a building, the library of the Department of Cooperation will be opened. In order to commemorate the cooperative tutor Mr. Xue Xianzhou, the school specially named the library "Xianzhou Hall" on the 55th Alumni Day this year (see photo), so that students can face this great building and suddenly feel respectful thoughts.</p>
<p>Field Investigation to Discover New Knowledge</p>
<p>Because cooperation is a practical science, students in the Department of Cooperation cannot only search through books. They must experience reality and investigate the current situation in order to improve and develop in the future. Therefore, Mr. Chen Zhongming used this year's summer vacation to introduce them to various cooperatives in Nanjing, Hangzhou, Taiwan, Suzhou, and this city for internships, so that they could verify the knowledge in books through internships and understand the characteristics of the cooperative movement in China. Students are particularly satisfied with the faculty lineup. In addition to Chen Zhongming as the department head, there are also Wang Shiying, Luo Qianying, Huang Zhaoxing, Tang Xunze and others as professors. Mr. Luo Qianying is the editor-in-chief of the "Cooperative Economics Monthly." He is enthusiastic and brave, has more than twenty years of experience in the cooperative movement, and has a wealth of cooperative writings. He hopes that a complete set of cooperative theory and a new school of cooperation can be produced at Fudan. Mr. Wang Shiying, who has a long-standing reputation in the cooperative sector, teaches advanced cooperative economics here. Mr. Huang Zhaoxing teaches agricultural cooperation. Like Mr. Chen Zhongming, he has visited cooperative enterprises in various European countries and has profound research on agricultural cooperation. These professors are very close to the students, so students dare to discuss various cooperative issues without any concerns. Indeed, the Department of Cooperation is still a newborn at Fudan, but the teachers and students of the Department of Cooperation have a common ideal, that is, they all hope that this child, who has been conceived for thirty years and only recently born, will become stronger and stronger in suffering, like the young motherland.</p>
<p>Undoubtedly, in order to promote the realization of the Principle of People's Livelihood, the cooperative enterprise has shouldered the important task of national economic construction today. In the past, Fudan has made glorious contributions to the growth of the cooperative movement in China, but for decades, the cooperative movement has not been universally developed, the cooperative ideology has not been deeply rooted in the people, and a complete cooperative theory suitable for the national conditions has not been established. Therefore, in order to accompany the progress of history, in order to make the cooperative movement develop actively and steadily, based on the Three Principles of the People and based on the philosophy of people's livelihood, to establish a set of practical and immortal cooperative theory, should be the new mission of the Fudan Cooperative Department in the future.

Little Yellow Hair shot forcefully, and Xu Fusheng parried it not far away. Yellow Hair added another shot, breaking the net and scoring. The Blue team took the lead 1-0. The White team counterattacked but found no openings. Until five minutes before the end of the first half, the Blue team attacked again.

Two minutes later, Xu Erz of the White team committed a foul in the penalty area, and Sun Jinshun failed to score the penalty kick. The first half ended with the Blue team leading 2-0.</p>
<h3>Lineup Changes in the Second Half</h3>
<p>After the break, there were changes in the lineups of both the Blue and White teams. Robert Stoff and Li [name] of the Blue team switched with Han Longhai and Jin Lusheng of the White team.

Just as they were planning to raise the banner again, Longhai of the Blue team also launched a light cavalry attack, scoring a sneaky goal, making it 3-1. At 34 minutes, Jin Lusheng left the field due to injury. As the match approached the final stage, neither side scored any more goals. As a result, the Blue team defeated the White team 3-1, completing the final selection battle.</p>
<h3>Tianjin Area Selection Tournament for the World Games Basketball Competition Begins</h3>

<h3>Badminton First Division Competition: Zhonghua Defeats John</h3>
<p>Zhonghua defeated John 6-3 yesterday. The Badminton League First Division Championship will be retained by Zhonghua because Zhonghua's total score exceeds John's by as many as nine points. John will have a match against Tiyun. If John wins Tiyun 9-0, their score will be equal to Zhonghua's. However, weighing the strength, it seems unlikely that John will have a complete victory of nine points. Therefore, the championship will belong to Zhonghua. The results of yesterday's finals are as follows:</p>

<p>Basketball Committee Replies to Seoul Team, Hoping They Can Come to Shanghai During Lunar New Year</p>
<p>The Seoul Basketball Team of Korea recently telegraphed the Municipal Basketball Committee, intending to travel south for an expedition at the end of the month. The Basketball Committee convened a meeting to discuss and decided to welcome the team to Shanghai, but hoped that they could change the departure to after February 10th. There are two reasons: 1. Due to the scheduled program of the basketball league, it is inconvenient to change it, and the venue is a major problem. After February 10th, there will be no such difficulties. 2. The end of this month coincides with the end of the Lunar New Year, and after February 10th coincides with the Lunar New Year period, which will be more convenient. The Basketball Committee has telegraphed the above two points to the team a few days ago, and also asked the Associated Press to contact them.</p>

<h3>Minister Yu Returns to Nanjing After Discussing Matters in Shanghai; Comprehensive Rice Rationing Scheduled to Be Implemented; Mayor Wu Will Serve as Chairman of the People's Food Allocation Committee</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] Regarding the matter of comprehensive rice rationing in this city, Minister Yu [name] of the Ministry of Food arrived in Shanghai and, after consultation with Director Wu [name] of the Bureau of Social Affairs, it has been decided to implement it starting in March. However, the original plan was for the government to ration one dou (a unit of dry volume, approx. 10 liters) per person per month and allow the purchase of one dou. Now, the Ministry of Food, based on research by foreign experts in various aspects such as nutrition, believes that one and a half dou per person per month is enough for the Chinese people's rice consumption. After consideration, it will be stipulated that each person will receive 1.8 sheng (a unit of dry volume, 1 sheng = 0.1 dou) per month. Among them, 0.8 sheng will be rationed by the government, and one dou will be allowed to be purchased from the market. The price of government-rationed rice is prepared to be calculated at 60% of the market price, which is still awaiting a formal decision by the Executive Yuan. Regarding the issue of expanding and reorganizing the Municipal People's Food Allocation Committee, Minister Yu and Director Wu decided after consultation that Mayor Wu will serve as the chairman and Director Wu will serve as the vice-chairman. However, because both are busy with government affairs and have no time to take care of it, another vice-chairman will be appointed to take actual responsibility. The reorganization will be implemented after the official order from the Executive Yuan arrives, and the date is expected to be in mid-February.</p>
<p>Another report: According to people in the rice industry, the recent surge in rice prices was completely caused by the poor transportation due to the snow and wind. If the weather clears and the transportation is smooth, the rice market can be leveled. According to relevant parties, the implementation of household rice rationing is scheduled to begin in early March. All rationed rice has been prepared, and rice and flour from American relief supplies are also being transported to China one after another. Therefore, the supply of rice in this city can be said to be worry-free.</p>
<h3>After Inspecting Industrial and Mining Construction Enterprises, Weng Wenhao Returns to Shanghai from Guangdong; Resource Committee Cooperates with Guangdong Provincial Government to Develop Resources</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] Weng Wenhao, Chairman of the Resource Committee, and Secretary-General Wu Zhaohong and others, were invited by Song Wenshi, Chairman of Guangdong Province, to go to Guangdong to inspect industrial and mining construction enterprises and plan the development of industry in the province. They have completed their official business and flew to Shanghai from Guangdong at 3:00 PM yesterday.</p>
<p>It is reported that the results of Weng's trip were quite satisfactory. It is said that the Resource Committee has decided to cooperate with the Guangdong Provincial Government to cultivate and develop the following three items: 1. Explore new coal mines in Guangdong Province to provide a sufficient supply of fuel for the province. 2. Develop sugar cane production and add modern sugar factories, planning to transfer some sugar factories from Taiwan to Guangdong as much as possible. 3. Develop hydropower as much as possible in Guangdong Province to fully supply the power needed to develop Guangdong Province's industry.</p>
<p>During their stay in Guangdong, Weng and others conducted extensive inspections and investigations in three areas and conducted detailed research and discussions with the Guangdong Provincial Government, which has resulted in concrete plans. After arriving in Shanghai yesterday, Weng and others held talks with the Central Bank and other related parties. The issue of allocating funds for the development of Guangdong Province's industry was discussed in detail.</p>
<p>Weng and others are scheduled to take the train to Nanjing tonight to report the results of this trip to the central authorities and ask for further guidance.</p>
<h3>Flour Reporting for Transshipment - No Permit Fee Regulations</h3>
<p>[Report from our Newspaper] According to a statement from the Ministry of Food: A five-member petition delegation consisting of the speakers of the Hebei-Tianjin Provisional Assembly, and representatives from industrial and commercial circles, reported to Minister Yu that for each bag of flour shipped from Shanghai to Tianjin, a permit fee of 150,000 yuan was required. Minister Yu attached great importance to this illegal demand and, in addition to answering the petitioners face-to-face and requesting them to provide as much evidence as possible, has also dispatched Inspector Chen Kai, Supervisory Committee Member Xu Gongrang, and Section Chief Li Cheng to be responsible for a thorough investigation. According to the regulations, flour produced by flour mills in various provinces and cities in the Jiangnan region and reported for transshipment is subject to a quota verified by the Ministry of Land and Food and released by the customs, without any permit fees.</p>
<h3>Cigarette Market Turns from Weak to Strong</h3>
<p>The cigarette market yesterday started off flat, but as small investors sold off profits, and Yizhong's out-of-town branches dumped inventory on the market, the market showed a weak trend. However, by noon closing, due to strengthened sentiment among major dealers, various parties came to buy, and prices rose again. As a result, a pack of ten Great Britain cigarettes rose by 200,000 yuan compared to the previous day, reaching 34,452,000 yuan. Old Knife cigarettes increased by 250,000 yuan, to 28,000,001 yuan. Hade Gate also rose by 250,000 yuan, while other brands went up by 500 to 1,200 yuan per carton. Canned cigarettes of brands such as Crik, 35克, and Laiwen remained weak.</p>
<p>Also, it is reported that Yizhong Company's Great Britain cigarette price list has been adjusted, with a pack of 20 cigarettes increasing to 34,000,000 yuan and a pack of 10 cigarettes increasing to 33,000,000 yuan, both representing an increase of 3,000,000 yuan compared to the previous price list.</p>
<h3>Detailed Rules for Cotton Yarn and Cloth Management to Be Implemented Soon</h3>
<p>The implementation rules for various aspects of cotton yarn and cloth management, including commissioned spinning, commissioned weaving, unified purchasing, and unified sales, drafted by the National Cotton Yarn and Cloth Management Committee, have been reviewed by the Ministry of Economic Affairs but still need to be finalized. Therefore, the heads of the three departments of the committee, namely the Business Department and the Technical Department, met yesterday to finalize the rules, and Fei Mingyang, the director of the Control Department of the Ministry of Economic Affairs, took them to Beijing yesterday for final approval. It is said that there are a total of seven implementation rules, which the Ministry of Economic Affairs should approve and send to Shanghai within two or three days, and they can be announced and implemented within this week.</p>
<p>In addition, the indoor courses for the committee's yarn mill specialist training have been completed last week. Starting today, trainees will be assigned to various spinning mills for a week of practical training. Next week, they will be assigned to work in various yarn mills in conjunction with the implementation rules.</p>
<h3>Oil Industry Expresses Opposition to Diesel Fuel Allocation Method</h3>
<p>Recently, the association handled the registration of diesel raw materials, stipulating that diesel fuel allocation to factories would only be granted to those with licenses from the Ministry of Economic Affairs. All oil refining factories in the city, except for Yongda and Tongming, do not meet the qualifications. The association believes that some member factories have already obtained factory registration certificates from the Bureau of Social Affairs and are in the process of submitting them to the Ministry of Economic Affairs for factory registration. Therefore, it raised objections to the Petroleum Transportation Control Commission's (輸管會) diesel allocation method and requested the committee to re-examine it.</p>
<p>It is said that regarding the registration of various oil refining factories with the Petroleum Transportation Control Commission's diesel allocation office according to the factory registration method, the industry believes that it should be based on the forms filled out by each factory, and the association should report them to facilitate management and prevent abuses. Regarding the standards for qualified registration, which require registration with the Ministry of Economic Affairs and continuous operation, the industry requests that the registration standards should be handled in accordance with Article 5, Section 2 of the "Application Registration and Supply Method for Diesel and Fuel Oil Users," and that companies that have obtained receipts for registration with the Ministry of Economic Affairs should be allowed to be eligible for allocation. The industry association has decided to argue with the Petroleum Transportation Control Commission on the basis of reason.</p>
<h3>Hong Kong's Industrial Climate Is Thriving - Factory Registration Applications Are Close to Pre-War Numbers</h3>
<p>Hong Kong News: Although Hong Kong factories and their machinery suffered losses of up to 80% during the war, and despite soaring construction materials and wages after the war, Hong Kong's industry has made considerable progress in the past two years. The speed of its recovery is truly astonishing. The current productivity of Hong Kong has almost reached 70% of the pre-war level. If the current rate of recovery continues for the next two years, the productivity of Hong Kong's new and old industries will exceed any pre-war year.</p>
<p>Almost all of Hong Kong's pre-war factories have been completely or partially rebuilt, and many new factories have either started production or are under development. Since the war, 1,297 factories have been registered in Hong Kong, of which 112 have been closed. There are currently 1,185 factories in operation. In the past few months, 883 factories have been accepted for registration by the Hong Kong Labour Department, while others are still under investigation. More applications are being submitted to the Labour Department every day, requesting registration, and it is believed that the number of registered factories in Hong Kong will soon exceed the pre-war record of 1,200.</p>
<p>The largest of Hong Kong's new industries is the textile industry. Shanghai industrialists found it difficult to work in Shanghai, so they moved their factories south to Hong Kong. Weaving and knitting industries are also developing. Japanese weaving was Hong Kong's main competitor before the war. If Japanese goods are unable to rise again in the next few years, the future of Hong Kong's weaving industry is unlimited and may increase production by up to 200%.</p>
<p>As for the establishment of heavy industry, it is very likely that copper and iron factories, copper smelting plants, and small shipyards will be opened this year. In 1947, Hong Kong's shipyards were all busy and had received orders that would support their work for several months without stopping. New orders and requests for ship repairs are also coming in steadily, so there is no shortage of work. It is believed that more industrial institutions and new industries may be launched this year.</p>
<h3>Soap Prices Rise</h3>
<p>The soap market for daily necessities is experiencing strong demand from all parties due to urgent replenishment by industry players. There are rumors that the Huang Xiangmao factory price has increased to over 1.2 million yuan per case, which has further boosted market sentiment and buying interest, leading to a steady rise in prices. As a result, Guben soap was listed at 1.79 million yuan, an increase of 15,000 yuan compared to the previous day. Arrow Knife soap increased by 10,000 yuan, to 1.75 million yuan. Huang Xiangmao increased by 20,000 yuan, while Guang Sheng and Henry also increased by 10,000 to 20,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Furthermore, after the noon closing, although off-market transactions were scarce, asking prices continued to rise. Guben soap was priced as high as 1.8 million yuan before it could be bought, Huang Xiangmao rose to 1.265 million yuan, and other soaps were also more expensive than the prices inside.</p>
<h3>Repayment of Pre-War Deposits and Loans to Begin on January 27</h3>
<p>[Report from our Newspaper] The regulations on the repayment of pre-war deposits and loans in the banking industry were promulgated by the National Government on December 26th of last year. In order to ensure uniform calculation methods, the Shanghai Banking, Money Exchange, and Trust Association entrusted the Banking Society to formulate the "Uniform Handling Method for Pre-War Deposits and Loans in the Banking Industry." In addition to reporting this method to the Ministry of Finance for record and notifying all members to comply with it, it is now learned that the association has formally announced that repayment will begin on January 27th of this year, in accordance with Article 7 of the repayment regulations. Pre-war depositors and borrowers can quickly go to the relevant banks, money exchanges, and companies to complete the repayment procedures.</p>
<h3>Small-Scale Loan Syndicate for Money Exchanges to Be Established Soon</h3>
<p>[Report from our Newspaper] The preparation of a small-scale credit loan syndicate formed by 76 money exchanges in the city has been reported in previous newspapers. It is now learned that the syndicate's basic capital has reached 4.95 billion yuan. A management committee has been established to manage the syndicate's affairs, with Mr. Shen Rixin elected as the chairman and Zou Rangqing, Pei Jiande, and Lu Shuchen appointed as directors of various groups. Hong Jingshan, who has worked at the Zhuzai Commercial Reclamation Bank for many years, has been hired as the director of the loan department. Accountants and investigators have been appointed to handle affairs. The syndicate's address is located downstairs in the Ningbo Road Money Exchange Association, and it will soon be announced established and begin operations. It is reported that the target of the syndicate's loans is small-scale industry and commerce in the city, with the amount of each loan temporarily set at 2 million to 6 million yuan, with a monthly interest rate of 6%, and a maximum term of three months, with interest and principal repaid monthly. Borrowers can request introductions from various syndicate member money exchanges, and after the exchanges conduct preliminary investigations, they will be sent to the syndicate for approval.</p>
<p>Although the match trade is not hot, asking prices for brands such as Meili, Fenghuang, and Nanjing have increased by 100,000 to 200,000 yuan, while miscellaneous brands are weaker. The kerosene and candle market remains stable.</p>
<h3>Potassium Chlorate, etc., Direct Allocation to Manufacturers Under Consideration by the Petroleum Transportation Control Commission</h3>
<p>The Export-Import Management Committee is currently considering allowing the import of two chemical industrial raw materials, "phosphorus" and "potassium chlorate," which are most needed by the match industry. In the past, after these raw materials were imported, they were often allocated by the Petroleum Transportation Control Commission to importers, who then distributed them to various manufacturers in the industry. The industry believes that this places an excessive burden on them, so it has requested the committee to directly allocate the raw materials to the industry's manufacturers in the future. The Petroleum Transportation Control Commission has agreed to consider this proposal and is currently convening representatives from the Municipal Chamber of Commerce and the Industrial Association to discuss it.</p>
<h3>Sichuan Province Develops Special Products - Provincial Government Formulates Three Major Plans</h3>
<p>[Report from our Newspaper in Chengdu] In order to develop Sichuan's export trade, the Sichuan Provincial Government has expanded the production and marketing of special products this year, and its planned projects include: Developing tung oil cultivation, completing 50,000 mu in Wanzhou, Fengjie, Yunyang, Wushan, and other counties this year, and organizing tung oil production cooperatives. A wool washing and pressing factory will be established in Guanxian, a joint venture between the government and merchants, using scientific methods to refine the wool produced in Songpan and sell it abroad. A large-scale pig bristle factory will be established in Longchang to refine pig bristles for export. The plan has now been approved and will be implemented immediately.</p>
<p>[Report from our Newspaper in Chengdu] The Sichuan Construction Department has formulated plans to develop and increase the production of Sichuan's export specialty products. Statistics for the 36th year show the production increase and sales situation: Black pig bristles: annual production of 1,000 dan; White pig bristles: annual production of 5,300 guan; Reed mats: annual production of 400 million pieces. All of the above are export goods, sold to the UK and the Soviet Union. Cowhide: annual production of 12,000 dan, 50% sold to Shanghai and Hankou, and the remaining 50% sold elsewhere. Sheepskin: annual production of 15,000 dan, 30% sold to Shanghai, and 70% sold to the UK and the US. Gallnuts: annual production of 20,000 dan, 60% sold to Shanghai, and the remaining 40% sold elsewhere.</p>
<h3>Difficult Exports and Rising Costs - The Future of the Fujian Tea Industry Is Bleak</h3>
<p>[Report from our Newspaper in Fuzhou] The tea market in Fuzhou, which has always been a major tea market in our country, has recently been affected by drastic price fluctuations, rising production costs, and stagnant exports. Tea merchants from various places who used to travel back and forth to buy and sell are now mostly taking a wait-and-see approach, and the lively scene of spring has now faded away. According to the local market conditions, the price of Tuen green tea has recently been above 2.4 million yuan per dan, which is roughly the same as that of Zhenmei Chongxin. Zhenmei is also above 2.3 million yuan. Ping Shui green tea has been reduced in price to 1.6 million yuan. High-quality black tea, such as Chong'an Xiaozhong, has reached over 3.5 million yuan, while medium and low grades are also in the range of 1.8 million to 2.4 million yuan. Mao tea is priced at 1.3 million yuan, and fried green tea is priced at 1.2 million yuan. These transaction prices have placed a great burden on tea merchants, as the overseas market is increasingly weak. It is said that the highest price for British black tea is 4 shillings and 10 pence per pound, while in the United States it is between 23 cents and 32 cents per pound, and North African green tea is equivalent to 70 cents to 1 US dollar. With the current export prices, plus packaging and shipping costs, each 50 kilograms is over 3 million yuan. In comparison, tea merchants can only sigh and look to the ocean. In August of last year, when the exchange rate was first adjusted, the export volume reached over 10,000 dan per month. In September, it was reduced to half that amount, and in October, it was only 4,000 dan. As for after November, there has been no improvement.</p>

<h3>New Advances in Radioactive Isotope Research</h3>
<p>— Yang Shi</p>
<p>Radioactive isotopes are powerful tools in both scientific research and medicine, but until recently, obtaining them was very expensive. Producing even small quantities from a cyclotron was frustrating, and the cost was considerable. Introducing radioactive carbon minerals worth fifty US dollars into a cyclotron and spending another million US dollars would only yield a small amount of radioactive isotopes. Now, a new method has been invented that allows artificial radioactive isotopes to be produced in large quantities. The Oak Ridge National Laboratory can now use chain fission to obtain what laymen call "artificial radium" from uranium piles. It not only supplies every advanced laboratory and hospital with unlimited applications for "treatment", but it can also be exported to countries around the world at a high price. This is a major step forward in the research of radioactive isotopes.</p>
<p>In medicine, the rays of radioactive isotopes can have miraculous effects in treating diseases. Whether injected into a vein or an organ, or even placed in a tasteless solution for the patient to swallow, these radium-like elements can accurately target the injured area, destroy pathogens, and heal the injury. Since the invention of the microscope, they have been a powerful tool in academic research. They can serve as a "detective" for physiologists, mixing with certain foods and entering the human body to reveal the physiological reactions that scientists want to know. In engineering, especially chemical analysis, they are indispensable tools.</p>
<p>Large-scale production at Oak Ridge is achieved by neutrons from fission impacting the pile, producing many radioactive isotopes. Over sixty elements can produce ninety types of isotopes. The 27-inch diameter cyclotron at the Yale University Physics Laboratory can also produce many very short-lived isotopes.</p>
<p>The Yale University Physics Laboratory, one of the American physical research centers, is conducting large-scale experiments with this new method of artificially creating radium. Countless planes and trains transport minerals to this laboratory. Leading this great research effort is Dr. Ernest Pollard, a pioneer in nuclear physics. Now, I can introduce the academic research help of these radioactive isotopes separately.</p>
<p>Phosphorus exists in nature, such as in phosphate rock. Artificial radioactive phosphorus can be made into a vaccine to prevent the activity of dysentery bacteria and injected into animals. For example, it can be mixed into nutrients and injected into the body, and a Geiger counter can be used to accurately check the location of the injury. If injected into chicken eggs, radioactive phosphorus becomes a germ incubator, causing the eggs to produce influenza viruses. If injected into pollen, it can cause mutation.</p>
<p>Due to the high affinity between iodine and the thyroid gland, radioactive iodine can be used as a powerful tool to treat the thyroid. When toxins move from the thyroid gland to a part of the human body, a dose of radioactive iodine and a Basin counter can immediately find the location of the poisoning, and then increase the amount of iodine to destroy the toxins and eliminate them forever. Because of this, radioactive iodine will save countless people.</p>
<p>Radioactive manganese has also solved many difficult problems for zoologists. For example, wasps and clams have no affinity in animal classification, but their bodies contain forty times more manganese than other animals. Why is this? The answer is radioactive manganese.</p>
<p>The short lifespan of many radioactive isotopes is surprising. Using this subtle relationship is of great help to the study of atomic nuclei. The US Naval Research Office has funded Dr. Pollard to continue his new explorations because of its importance. He invented a "slow clock" specifically to measure the lifespan of these radioactive isotopes. Radioactive neon produced by a cyclotron is measured by an electromagnetic lens to determine the energy of the rays, which determines that its lifespan is only forty seconds. The lifespan of radioactive nitrogen is only two hours.</p>
<p>From Professor Bertram Boltwood of Yale University discovered the first isotope (Ionium, slightly lighter than thorium) in 1906 to now, scientists have discovered more than 670 isotopes, of which more than 270 are fixed, such as heavy gas in water (twice as heavy as gas), and ten isotopes of tin that can be found in ordinary minerals. The rest are radioactive isotopes, their lifespans ranging from one millionth of a second to almost tens of millions of years. Most of them are artificially created, and as mentioned before, the small output means that scientists know that it is an extremely helpful tool for research, but cannot obtain large quantities to carry out their work. Now that they can be produced in large quantities, what they bring to scientific researchers will undoubtedly be a series of rapid advances.</p>
<h3>Food Substitutes for Rice</h3>
<p>— Ke Zhi</p>
<p>After the end of this World War, the whole world is facing a famine. It is said that for several years, people in Europe generally lacked protein in their food, which weakened their physical strength and promoted the spread of diseases. Since the end of the war, our country has been plagued by famines in various parts of the country due to natural and man-made disasters. This threat has not yet been lifted, and the number of people suffering from hunger is truly unknown, which is truly tragic!</p>
<p>Chemists believe that the essential nutrients are protein, fat, carbohydrates, minerals, and water. Recently, attention has also been paid to the issue of vitamins. Therefore, the most important things in nutrition now are probably protein, minerals, calories, and vitamins. Because if these nutrients are lacking, then there is not enough energy to supply the necessary for the human body to live, and naturally the body will get sick. What do we rely on to supply these nutrients? The food we eat is what supplies these elements. Vegetables are relatively inexpensive, but other things like meat and milk cannot be fully supplied in a period of material scarcity after the war, so the nutrition of the average person is lacking. Chemists came up with another method, using low-cost items to supply the human body's nutritional needs. Therefore, they used soybeans, which are rich in protein, as a material to make a powerful protein food. Surprisingly, eating this food has the same effect as eating other foods, enough to meet the nutritional needs of the human body. It turns out that the minerals contained in soybeans exceed those contained in flour by 10 to 15 times, the main vitamins exceed by 5 to 10 times, and the protein is as much as four times as much. Moreover, the protein in soybeans is similar in quality to that contained in beef. Because soybeans contain so many nutrients, nutritional chemists have also made it into soybean flour, making it even easier to carry and preserve for a long time.</p>
<p>Everyone knows that China has the largest output of soybeans in the world, but in China for thousands of years, soybeans have not been valued. Everyone only treats it as an ordinary coarse grain. Who knew that after being transformed by chemists, it would become an extremely important nutrient? However, the Northeast, which has the largest output, is currently short of food. Why not use more soybeans instead of rice and wheat? It is also a way to solve the food shortage. People are even using it as fuel, which is truly a pity.</p>
<p>What is even more amazing is that a completely nutritious food was also made under the efforts of a scientist. It turns out that the US Department of the Army and the United Nations have a food consultant named C. E. Clinton. In view of the increasingly serious famine after the war, he asked scientists at the California Institute of Technology to study and find ways to solve the food shortage problem. As a result, a Dr. Borook accepted this task, but this doctor did not do experiments in the laboratory, but instead thought of ways in his kitchen. Therefore, he only used pots in the kitchen as utensils, and did not use test tubes or other chemical instruments. He also hired a famous French chef as an assistant. With the scientist's great ability, after more than a year of research, he invented something with complete nutritional components, abbreviated as MPM. It seems that this is not a remarkable thing, its main component is just soy flakes with very low oil content and high protein content, and then add dehydrated sweet potatoes, vegetables, tomatoes, onions and spices, and the outside is coated with calcium and vitamins A, B, and C. But when you eat it, the color and taste are excellent, and it is very popular with both men and women, old and young. What is the nutritional value of this thing? It is said that just over two taels of dry weight can provide us with a big meal. This thing is also used to supply hundreds of schools in California, and it is very popular with teachers and students. Later, when the United Nations General Assembly was held in San Francisco, it was also used to supply representatives from various countries, and no one failed to praise it greatly.</p>
<p>Since this thing has been unanimously praised by all parties, it is not only inexpensive and of good quality, but also because it is a dried product, it is easier to transport. Therefore, it is not only popular in the United States, but also exported in large quantities. It is said that the United States can produce 10 million pounds per month and ship it to various parts of Europe. Calculating that each pound can provide meals for seven people, all of it can provide meals for more than 70 million people. At that time, Europe was facing a famine, and this thing happened to go to Europe to save many starving people. Aren't there many refugees in our country now? So I hope it will come to our country soon, so that the hungry people who are waiting to be fed can also taste it. But now the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA) agency in our country has been withdrawn. Fortunately, Dr. Borer, who invented this food, did not patent it, so I hope the recipe and manufacturing method of this food will be known to us as soon as possible, so that we can manufacture this food ourselves, and the refugees can also solve the problem of hunger.</p>

<h3>Ice-Made Mansion</h3>
<p>— Bai Shi</p>
<p>During World War II, the British planned to build a huge "ice island"—named "Habbakuk"—floating in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean for military aircraft to land and refuel. The famous scientist in charge of this revolutionary plan was Dr. Geoffrey Pyke. However, the war ended before his plan could be realized, but a lot of valuable information about the properties of ice had already been collected.</p>
<p>Dr. Pyke saw that ice is very easy to "weld" together; adding some fibrous material to it can increase its strength. To achieve this purpose, the Eskimos, who live in icy and snowy areas, have always used moss; but the British engineers used wood pulp, and the results were much better. The ideal mixture is 86% ice and 14% wood pulp—this new building material is called "Pykrete" to commemorate its inventor. After it is frozen into blocks, this material can be easily processed like wood or "artificial plastic" (such as "unbreakable glass," "bakelite," etc.), can be sawed into various shapes, and is very strong and durable. Of course, in places where the temperature is not always below freezing, artificial refrigeration must be used to keep the ice blocks solid—this is not difficult, like the method of preventing uneven expansion and contraction of parts when building huge hangars and the material has not yet solidified.</p>
<p>In temperate zones, with proper refrigeration, this mixture of wood pulp and ice, because it is light and strong, can be used to build temporary houses, towers, and other things that cannot be built with heavy steel-reinforced concrete. In the Arctic Circle, wooden and brick buildings often collapse or become deformed during thawing periods, and this ice can replace them as a cheap and satisfactory building material. When we start to develop the large amounts of coal and gold and other natural resources hidden in the "Antarctic Zone," using this "wood pulp ice" to build houses, etc., is obviously the cheapest and most convenient method. Naturally, these buildings do not need artificial refrigeration, and the strong winds there can be used to generate electricity to warm their interiors. The future Antarctic city may be a large pile of glittering and sparkling residences, factories, offices, schools, and roads—all made of ice!</p>
<h3>Electron Microscope</h3>
<p>— Ming Yu</p>
<p>There is a square fluorescent screen at the focal point, and the electron stream passes through the sample in the middle, and projects the image onto the fluorescent screen, so people can see a quite large image on the screen. Such images are three and a half inches wide. However, one drawback of this microscope is the fatal blow of the electron stream to living organisms. Under an ordinary microscope, what we see are active, living things; but under an electron microscope, it is not the case, what we see are static, dead things. If we remove the fluorescent screen and replace it with a dry plate, we can take a photograph for continuous observation. However, this cannot be said to be a "photograph" because it does not use "photons," so some cautious scientists created a term called "Electron Micrographs."</p>
<p>The first electron photograph to meet the world was a shallow work. Under a strong cathode ray, a shadow of a banknote was left on the dry plate. This happened seventeen years ago.</p>
<p>From that photograph to the "toxin" micrographs taken today, it must be said that there has been a huge progress. These toxins must be so small that some are active organisms, and some are just chemical molecules. Today's scientists are explaining them with the help of these microphotographs. In short, these toxins have historically caused influenza, colds, smallpox, polio, and other diseases, or perhaps the diseases are caused by them. We are about to see the true faces of these toxins, adding many materials to the medical crime photo album.</p>
<p>The true images of vitamins and enzymes will also be captured. These substances were impossible to see by any method before. Once many electron microscopes are available, the wonders presented by those common substances around us and in our bodies will be countless.</p>
<p>The electron microscope has another possibility: that from this we may be able to further glimpse the molecular structure inside matter, which is what scientists are most excited about. Although this move is currently flawed in the structure of the super-microscope, in principle, it must be possible. As long as it can capture objects that are one hundred times smaller than it can capture today, it can also be used to observe molecules. There are many people who are using their life's energy and huge amounts of money to solve the structural patterns of molecules through this academic approach.</p>
<p>Chemists have always been like clever blind people using their brains as eyes. If they could once see how the molecules inside various substances are arranged, there would be an amazing progress in organic chemistry, which is needless to say. This branch of chemistry has already created "nylon," rayon, synthetic resin, and rubber sulfur for us—completely a new industry.</p>
<p>Why is there such a possibility? Our explanation is this: the extent to which an object is small and can still be seen by us depends on the length of the light wave we use when viewing it. In other words, the shorter the wavelength, the more it can reflect smaller parts.</p>
<p>The wavelength of the electron stream depends on the speed at which the electrons travel, and the rate of travel depends on the potential difference that urges them. The voltage used in today's electron microscopes ranges from 10,000 volts to 90,000 volts, and the wavelength it produces is as short as 50 angstroms (one angstrom equals one ten-millionth of a centimeter), which is equivalent to the size of the objects that can be seen today.</p>
<p>When the voltage reaches one million volts, the speed of the electron stream can be increased to more than 175,000 miles per second, and the wavelength is about one-hundredth of an angstrom. In a molecule containing carbon and hydrogen atoms, the distance between atoms is about two angstroms. It is not difficult to create a one million volt voltage, and scientists are likely to succeed in capturing molecular patterns.</p>
<p>This theory implies the goal that scientists will strive for in the future. In the past, the difficulties and hardships encountered for the infinitely small are encouraging them to move forward. A new era of exploration has begun. (To be continued)</p>
<h3>Industrial Underground</h3>
<p>— Zheng Zuoqing</p>
<p>During World War II, the most effective way to prevent air raids on the aircraft production industry was to move all production facilities underground. The U.S. Army Air Forces Supply Command's recent study of German underground industry concludes that the above statement is undoubtedly true.</p>
<p>Historically, the first underground factory was the precision instrument manufacturing plant established in the Mulhausen caves in Thuringia, Germany in 1917. In 1943, the German V2 rocket manufacturing plant was also moved underground. The following year, Hitler ordered that all aircraft production facilities must be moved underground. Unfortunately, the war situation was deteriorating at that time, and there was not enough time to fully implement the underground plan.</p>
<p>Germany adopted two types of underground construction at that time: one was partially underground, used to resist the most devastating carpet bombing; the other was completely underground. The former mostly adopted the "submarine" structural form, which was a dome made of strong reinforced concrete, surrounded by huge walls and thick covers. Another form of partial underground structure was the "coal bunker" type, which was roughly similar to the "submarine" structure. These structures were roughly 80 feet high, divided into four to six floors, with a total plane of 1.2 million square feet, of which 40% of the plane was underground. Although the "coal bunker" structure was not fully completed for use, this design seemed to be the most suitable semi-underground structure in Germany. It has a large amount of plane available for use, and the height is appropriate, the access is convenient, and all defense facilities are quite effective.</p>
<p>Scientific Chat</p>
<h3>Colloids</h3>
<p>— Qu Youding</p>
<p>Matter can usually be divided into three states: liquid, solid, and gas, but in addition, there is also a colloid. This is formed by suspending certain substances such as sulfur, Prussian blue, or even pure gold in a liquid substance. The suspended particles of this substance are so small that they cannot be seen even with the highest-powered microscope, but they do not dissolve in the liquid. This phenomenon was first discovered about a hundred years ago by Semi Berzlius and Faracay. Within a few years, Thomas Graam of England discovered that truly dissolved substances can freely pass through parchment paper or animal membranes, but strange liquids such as gelatin and animal glue are not like this. To distinguish them from the aforementioned colloidal suspensions, he called them sols. After many people's research, it was learned that these so-called colloids are not another state of matter. This is not a matter of substance type, but a matter of particle size. The size of these colloid particles cannot be observed with an ordinary microscope.</p>
<p>Under appropriate conditions, any substance can be made into a sol state. There are several ways to do this. The particles can be built or concentrated by the reaction of atoms, molecules, or ions, or they can be obtained by crushing and separating larger particles. For example, adding a concentrated iron chloride solution to boiling water can obtain colloidal particles of iron hydroxide (Fe(OH)3). These small particles are separated after iron chloride (FeCl3) is quickly hydrolyzed by water, and can be suspended for many years without falling. The color of this colloid is dark brown. However, the iron chloride solution should not be added too quickly, otherwise iron oxide will be obtained instead of iron hydroxide. When iron chloride is hydrolyzed, hydrochloric acid is also produced at the same time, which remains in the colloid; if you want to remove it, you must use Gragam's famous separation method, namely dialysis. If a capillary membrane filter and an animal membrane are used, although hydrochloric acid and colloid can pass through the filter membrane, when the acid solution passes through the animal membrane, the colloid is blocked back (iron hydroxide particles cannot pass through). Gragam used pig bladder and parchment paper, and the colloid membrane and water immersion machine used now are more effective. The method is to cut the membrane into a circle with a diameter of eight to eleven inches, then make a funnel shape, tightly tie the lower end to form a bag, pour the colloid liquid into it, half full, and then place the bag in a water basin. After a few minutes, put the blue litmus paper into the water, and you will see it turn from blue to red, which means that the water has become acidic.</p>
<p>Why do colloids and the like appear to be suspended? There are two reasons: one is that the supporting liquid's sub-thousandth of the movement, colliding the colloid point back and forth, resists the earth's gravitational force; the other is that the colloid points are each charged, repelling each other. The latter can be known from the following experiment: the method is to connect the two poles of a forty-five volt or ninety volt battery to two carbon rods, and place them separately at both ends of a V-shaped tube filled with Prussian blue colloid liquid. Because the points of this colloid are negatively charged, they are repelled by the negative pole and attracted by the positive pole; after a few minutes, you can see the blue substance moving from the negative pole to the positive pole. If it is an oxygenated iron colloid, because its particles are positively charged, the situation is reversed, and it is not very obvious, and when it gathers at the negative pole, there is a phenomenon of falling.</p>
<p>From this, we can imagine that if two types of colloid particles with opposite charges are mixed in appropriate amounts, their protons will attract each other, so that the charge is neutralized, and the particles often cannot be suspended again; therefore, when Prussian blue and oxygenated colloid points are mixed, larger particles are seen falling to the bottom of the container. If sufficient acid, lye, and other charged colloids are added, the charge can also be neutralized, causing them to fall; this is why aluminum sulfate or iron sulfate is often added to muddy water in cities to clean drinking water. principle.</p>
<p>There is a method of destroying large particles to form colloid particles, called Peptization. This method can be known from the following example: coat a water filter with a thick Prussian blue paste, and oxalic acid (C2H2O4) color immediately begins to invade the fine pores of the water filter; if you find a way to remove the oxalic acid, the remaining blue will become colloidal. According to this, colloidal Prussian blue is the raw material for writing ink and is widely used as a dye.</p>
<p>Also, colloidal points can often be produced by the following method: another solution dilutes a solution containing a certain solid. However, the solution used for dilution needs to be one that cannot dissolve the same body. For example, pouring a sulfur alcohol solution into water can obtain a milky sulfur sol. Making shellac white is another example, because water dilutes the alcohol that dissolves shellac grease; shellac grease is insoluble in water, so it becomes colloidal points that precipitate in water, and because it has light scattering properties, it appears white.</p>
<h3>Alkali—One Cannot Live Without It For A Day</h3>
<p>— Wang Qiande</p>
<p>Humans cannot live on earth without the supply of water. This is a very common thing that everyone knows, but similarly, humans cannot live on earth without alkali for a day; I am afraid everyone will be surprised or even laugh at this! Please understand the following facts clearly, and you can turn your doubts into trust.</p>
<p>"Alkali" is a general name. In fact, if you want to divide it carefully, you can divide it into three types: soda ash (soda) Sodium Carbonate, caustic soda (caustic soda) Sodium Hydroxide, and baking soda (baking soda Ssdium Bicarbonate). Now, according to the above order, let's talk about their main uses separately:</p>
<p>Soda Ash—In cities, it is not uncommon for relatively new houses and buildings to have several glass windows, but the main raw material for that window glass is soda ash.</p>
<p>Anyone who has lived in the countryside must have seen or heard that the women in the countryside often use grass ash as a detergent to scrub dirty clothes in the grass ash. The clothes after washing are indeed very clean. What is the reason? Because grass ash contains soda ash, and soda ash has the ability to remove dirt.</p>
<p>More importantly, without soda ash, I am afraid that there would be no ships coming and going in the ocean today, and the coastal cities would still be poor rural areas, unable to have modern industries, because seawater contains minerals such as magnesium, calcium, and aluminum. All water containing such minerals is called "hard water." It is absolutely unsuitable for factory boilers and the heart of ships—steam boilers—and will cause explosions after a long time. Therefore, the water used by factories in coastal areas or ships sailing in the ocean must first be softened with "soda ash" and lime before it can be used without any worries.</p>
<p>Other industries such as the textile industry, the production of bubble alkali, and the production of toothpaste are all related to alkali.</p>
<p>Caustic Soda—Soap is a household item, a detergent that cannot be missing for a day. Anyone will have the opportunity to use soap. Whether it is medicated soap, perfume soap, or laundry soap, the main raw material cannot escape caustic soda.</p>
<p>Furthermore, without caustic soda, where would the now fine whatman paper and newsprint come from? I am afraid it would still only be extremely rough bamboo paper! Because the first step in manufacturing pulp is to corrode the raw materials into pure fibers, and "caustic soda" is a very strong corrosive agent.</p>
<p>Mercerized socks and mercerized cloth are quite popular in modern cities, but I am afraid that only a very small number of people know the raw materials. When it comes to mercerized cloth and mercerized socks, we should commemorate Mercer—the originator of mercerized cloth—and thank caustic soda; many people think that mercerized cloth is woven with silk and cotton, but this is completely wrong. The so-called mercerized cloth is only cotton yarn treated with caustic soda solution, so that the straight cotton fibers become spiral. The cotton cloth woven from spiral fibers emits a silky luster due to the reflection of light, becoming the popular mercerized cloth. Furthermore, rayon, the natural silk's powerful enemy, is nothing more than a product of caustic soda treatment of waste materials.</p>
<p>Also, the monosodium glutamate used for seasoning is also a product made from caustic soda.</p>
<p>Baking Soda—In the hot summer weather, cold drinks are the holy product for quenching thirst and relieving heat. Soda is a type of cold drink. Why does soda have gas? This is because carbon dioxide gas is pressed into the soda. Carbon dioxide gas will produce bubbles when the pressure is released, so sometimes when the soda bottle cap is opened, even the soda ice will spray out, but you should know that baking soda is the best raw material for making carbon dioxide.</p>
<p>A few years ago, baking soda was a good medicine for stomach diseases, but now it has gradually become obsolete.</p>
<p>If you often eat bread, flatbread, or fried dough sticks, the yeast for fermentation is made from baking soda.</p>
<p>Some red fire extinguishers on the wall are also made from a solution of baking soda and sulfuric acid.</p>
<p>Can humans live on earth without washing clothes? Can you not use soap? Can you not use paper? If your answer is "no," then you have to admit the importance of alkali.</p>

<h3>Sixty Dishes</h3>
<p>— He Ku</p>
<p>The arrival of the President Cleveland ocean liner in Shanghai really made Shanghai's money-chasing craze sweep for a while. The newspapers have not seen such frivolous news representing peace for a long time. It is enough for us to appreciate the luxury of this ocean liner from paper.</p>
<p>The food on the ship alone is enough to make people gasp. A large meal has more than sixty dishes. You can choose from delicacies from land and sea. If you are a glutton with a large appetite, as long as you can eat it, you can take all sixty dishes without adding additional fees. As the Chinese saying goes, "Once you open a restaurant, you are not afraid of big stomachs." The Cleveland truly put this into practice. But I dare say that even someone with a slightly better appetite will never be able to eat all sixty dishes: this means that the shipping company is generous, but the enjoyment of passengers has a saturation point, just as "the years of the universe are infinite, while the lifespan of human beings is limited."</p>
<p>Therefore, I don't think there is anything to envy about Cleveland. Because she only provides a sumptuous meal for five hundred and several passengers, and cannot provide a portion of filling dry food for everyone who needs food. Mencius once questioned the King of Qi, "Which is more enjoyable, to enjoy alone or to enjoy with others?" The conclusion is "It is better to enjoy with others!" If you compare Cleveland to the world, it is exactly the distinction between "enjoying alone" and "enjoying with others." Even though she has a large meal with sixty dishes, how much digestive power is there between the stomach and intestines, only two or three dishes?</p>
<p>When most people in the world can only squeeze into trams and are cramped on small steamers, a Cleveland is just a auspicious grass in paradise, and has nothing to do with the ordinary plants on the ground. As for whether auspicious grass can grow on the ground, my answer is affirmative, but the ordinary plants have to work hard themselves!</p>
<h3>Talking About Playing With Fire</h3>
<p>— Yi Feng</p>
<p>Greek mythology says this: there was originally no fire in the human world. Since Prometheus stole it from heaven and gave it to the human world, the human world began to have shining, heating, and lovely flames of fire. Therefore, it also caused God's great annoyance. He locked him with chains on a mountain peak and let eagles peck at his lungs as a punishment for stealing fire. Although this is a myth, why was God so stingy with his fire and unwilling to give it to humans? I think it was probably because when he created humans, he had already foreseen that human ambition would be difficult to train. Once there was fire, it would be even worse, and the world would come to an end because people with ambition played with fire, right? Otherwise, why would Prometheus, who stole fire for people, receive such a severe punishment?</p>
<p>The fact is indeed the case. Since there has been fire in the world, many fire players have continued to emerge. These fire players are all powerful and self-willed, and ambitious tyrants. They used fire as a weapon to kill people, conquer others, and massacre the good, causing humans to suffer unprecedented misfortune and inevitably die in large numbers. Prometheus, who suffered for humans and kindly stole fire for the world, will definitely regret it when he hears this, right?</p>
<p>Yes, "fire players often perish in fire," and as the saying goes, "playing with fire gets you burned," which seems to be a punishment deliberately given by God to a group of ambitious people. However, the fact is very sad. Ambitious people who "play with fire and perish in fire" continue to emerge, and the effect of "lessons from the past" is actually very small!</p>
<p>Isn't that so? Twenty years after William, there was Hitler. This guy was so majestic! At the beginning of the Second World War, a fire destroyed Poland, and another fire destroyed France. In two months, he swept the European continent. He is truly a strong man among fire-playing groups from ancient times to the present. But he finally couldn't escape the law of "playing with fire and getting burned." The good times didn't last long. He was frustrated by the blizzard in Moscow, and then frustrated by Uncle Sam's aircraft fleet. In the end, he had to "immolate himself" in the presidential palace in Berlin. The Japanese devils were also like this. From the fire of "September 18th" to the fire of "March 8th," they were really proud in the East for ten years; however, by the same token, they returned it to their own bodies. The unprecedented fire of the atomic bomb finally burned on the gate in August 1945, and they had to declare surrender!</p>
<p>Today, more than two years after the end of the Second World War, new fire-playing is rapidly approaching and the mountains of "ashes rekindling" are rising. The politics of "power" has not changed its face in the slightest. If the Third World War is unavoidable, then the wildfire will burn even more fiercely, and the misfortune of mankind will be even deeper and more bitter. Seeing that the flames of war have spread all over the world, I can't help but worry about those who set the fire!</p>
<h3>Eradicating Illiteracy</h3>
<p>— Fang Ren</p>
<p>Generally speaking, Shanghai is a culturally developed place, incomparable to the closed-off inland areas. However, according to statistics recently published by the Civil Affairs Bureau in this newspaper, among the 4,449,290 citizens, as many as 1,885,569 are illiterate, accounting for approximately 42% of the total population.</p>
<p>Since the Northern Expedition, our country has been paying attention to the work of eradicating illiteracy from the very beginning, and is still actively carrying it out. However, there is a common problem among Chinese people, which is the idea of "sweep the snow from your own doorstep and don't worry about the frost on your neighbor's roof." Regarding the work of eradicating illiteracy, schools, apart from the so-called "mass schools," never inquire about it. For example, the city currently has more than 140 mass schools, but because they do not have their own school buildings, they have to borrow from private primary and secondary schools, which has caused a lot of complications.</p>
<p>In fact, China is a poor country, and if we want to eradicate illiteracy, we can only adopt the most economical methods. Not to mention the existing educational institutions, which should make full use of empty classrooms at night. Even theaters, dance halls, or amusement parks can be used as places to promote social education when they are empty during the day or in the morning. Classrooms for eradicating illiteracy? This solves the problem of space. If we can supplement it with mobile education facilities, we can save the illiterate from trekking long distances, which will definitely be more effective. As for personnel, it is not excessive to conscript some intellectuals to assist. Therefore, eradicating illiteracy is not a matter of whether it can be done, but whether it will be done.</p>
<p>I remember that at the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) meeting, our country was listed as a dark area. What a shame! We should aspire to "China without illiteracy"; otherwise, the country's construction and its status will never be possible.</p>
<h3>Notes on the Harvard Library</h3>
<p>— Jin Jin</p>
<p>Harvard University in the United States is one of the top universities. Its library has a long history, established in 1638 with a donation of 400 books by John Harvard. Its collection is rich, with more than 4.6 million volumes of various books, making it the largest university library in the world. Among them, about 2 million volumes are housed in the Widener Memorial Library, completed in 1915. In addition, more than 100,000 rare books and manuscripts are housed in the Houghton Library, newly built in 1942. The humidity and temperature in the library are mechanically adjusted, and the latest instruments are used to maintain air cleanliness. The two buildings are interconnected by bridges and passages.</p>
<p>In addition, the university library itself is divided into 75 sections, each equivalent to a specialized library. Among them, the ones with the most books are: the law and medicine section, with 280,000 volumes; the business administration section, also known as the Baker Library; the Du-Ford Harvard Library, with 193,000 volumes; the public administration section, also known as the Littauer School of Public Administration Library, with 198,000 volumes; the Chinese and Japanese book section of the Harvard-Yenching Institute, with 185,000 volumes; the biological laboratory, with 73,000 volumes; and the observatory, with 37,000 volumes. They are truly a dazzling array of priceless treasures. All of the above libraries have a general catalog, telephone equipment, and messengers to deliver messages to maintain close contact.</p>
<p>Harvard University adds an average of 113,000 volumes each year. The library has endowments donated by various sectors, reaching more than US$3.7 million, and the income is used exclusively for purchasing books and library expenses.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the library's rare books number about 2,600 volumes, published before 1501. There are many works and manuscripts by the famous poet Keats, specially stored in a special room in Houghton Library. Other English writers from Chaucer onwards, and contemporary literary giants such as Mansfield, Joyce, Eliot, Robin Niu, and Steinbeck, all have their manuscripts fully collected.</p>
<p>Naturally, the Harvard University Library also collects many wonderful books that are not within the scope of university education research, such as chess scores, cookbooks, fishing scriptures, and joke collections, some of which are donated from the outside.</p>
<p>Finally, it must be added that the library has a particularly large collection of drama-related books, occupying several large rooms in the Widener Building, including more than one million playbills and brochures, and 260,000 photos of male and female actors, comparable to the Folger Shakespeare Library in Washington, D.C., known for its collection of early English theatrical history materials, and the New York Public Library, which specializes in collecting modern drama scripts.</p>
<p>Finally, the library's "poetry room" contains masterpieces by major contemporary poets. The map section in the Widener Building mainly collects ancient maps, while modern maps are managed by the branch library of the Institute for Geographical Exploration.</p>
<h3>The Forgetful Scholar</h3>
<p>— Lei Hong</p>
<p>Young Professor Oppenheimer was the leader of the atomic bomb experiment in New Mexico. But in his youth, he was often a careless fellow.</p>
<p>Once, he took his girlfriend out for a drive. Suddenly, the gasoline ran out, and it was a chilly autumn evening. So Oppenheimer took off his coat and asked his girlfriend to put it on to ward off the cold, and he rushed to a nearby gas station to find a way to get gasoline.</p>
<p>The girlfriend waited in the car. After an hour, he still didn't come back, so she panicked and reported it to the highway patrol.</p>
<p>The police easily solved the matter - they went directly to Oppenheimer's home and found him sound asleep in bed. He had completely forgotten about taking his girlfriend out, as well as his car, his coat, and so on.</p>
<h3>Haydn and His Creation</h3>
<p>— Lord</p>
<p>On the 25th of this month and the 1st of next month, there will be a grand sacred music concert at the Lyceum Theatre, a cooperative performance of the Ya Xue Society, which has a 30-year history, and the Symphony Orchestra, which has a 60-year history. This is the first cooperative performance after the victory, conducted by Professor Fu Hua. This reminds us of the grand scene when Master Mei Baiqi conducted these two orchestras before the war. Looking back on the past and comparing it to the present, some of the members who were young at the time are now gray-haired!</p>
<p>The program is Joseph Haydn's oratorio "The Creation".</p>
<p>Haydn, revered as the "Father of the Sonata" and the "Father of the Symphony," was also a great composer of sacred music. He was born in a cold village near Vienna in 1732. His father was a cartwright. But from an early age, he was a musical genius. At the age of eight, he entered the church as a choirboy and received musical education. Nine years later, he was dismissed due to voice change. Afterwards, he lived a difficult life, but he still worked hard to study composition, reading the works of the sonata composer Bach all day long. After 1760, he served as music director in the home of the music-loving Esterházy brothers for 30 years. Most of his works were completed here, and he was known as Bach's successor. In 1790, he went to London to travel and perform, and was inspired by Handel's oratorios. During his second visit, he obtained the script of "The Creation" and completed his great oratorio "The Creation" from 1795 to 1798.</p>
<p>"The Creation" not only expresses the author's noble character, but also is a culmination of the advantages of musical compositions, simple and majestic, and profound poetic meaning penetrates into the two realms of form and meaning. And the excellence of the style reveals the extraordinary mystery of the Creator. It can be said to encompass everything and contain everything, such as his writing of the revelation of chaos, the escape of the nether, the first appearance of the dawn, the changes of the universe, the fusion of the beauty of creation and the truth of art. It is truly a great work of immortal value.</p>
<p>The work is divided into three sections and 24 movements. The string music "Primeval Chaos" is used as a prelude, which is a pioneer in the style of oratorios. The characters in the song are angels Gabriel, Uriel, Raphael, and Adam and Eve.</p>
<p>The work was completed on April 29, 1798, and premiered at the Esterházy Palace the next day. It was publicly performed at the Royal Theatre on March 19, 1799, and the audience was greatly moved. At that time, the old musician said, "I cried, feeling as cold as ice, and then as hot as a fire." In his later years, he said, "Before composing "The Creation" every day, I pray to God to grant me the ability. I have never been so devout in my life."</p>
<p>Haydn has 120 symphonies in other works, including the famous "Farewell Symphony," which was written early in the Esterházy home as a farewell song for a group of musicians who were about to be disbanded. During the performance, one musician after another extinguished the candles in front of them, silently withdrew with their instruments, and finally only one violinist was left, and the atmosphere was very bleak. But at the same time, we can also see his humor in his works, such as in the quiet second movement of the Surprise Symphony, a sudden burst of loud drumbeats surprises the sleepy listeners, which is so humorous!</p>
<p>Therefore, in his old age, the ethereal and celestial "Creation" was produced. He passed away in 1809 in Vienna.</p>
<h3>A Song of Self-Examination</h3>
<p>— Kang Min</p>
<p>Loving good people and hating evil people is the common feeling of most people, and at least 99 out of 100 people put themselves in the category of good people. Even if someone reflects that they cannot be called a good person, I believe they are still trying their best to be a good person, and even more hope that others will praise them as a good person. Indeed, there are no inherently evil people in the world, and there are no people who deliberately harbor evil intentions. All those who commit evil and break the law have their own reasons and positions to forgive themselves.</p>
<p>However, are people really all good people? Even sages have faults. Examining oneself, who has no guilty conscience? Sima Guang himself said that in his life, he had never done anything that he could not tell others. This statement is probably no exception to the style of historical exaggeration.</p>
<p>Our country is not rich and strong. Although there are many reasons, it can be summarized in one sentence: the morality of the people is low. This is an educational problem, and educational problems cannot be solved in a few short years. At present, to rescue the continued decline of national morality, I think it is a matter of great urgency. The only way to achieve quick results is the method of "self-examination". I sincerely hope that everyone will conduct self-examination and reflection once a day.</p>
<p>Especially those who do not cooperate, are not responsible, do not produce, waste public property, seek private gain, speculate, are lazy, indulge, and are decadent, I pray that they will ask themselves: what are they living for? Is there a moment of peace in their conscience?</p>
<p>I am not qualified to teach those noble and wealthy "criminals of conscience", and they do not need my teaching either. Because everyone has a bright red and kind heart. I have already said that loving good people and hating evil people is the common feeling of people, and everyone likes others to praise them as good people. Therefore, as long as they have the opportunity to calm down and think about it, there will be a solution.</p>
<p>It does not mean that after a self-examination, a person's moral concept can be immediately improved, just like a patient who is extremely malnourished cannot restore health by swallowing a large amount of vitamins at once. But I firmly believe that as long as he has the opportunity to ask himself once a day, his conscience will definitely strongly pull him upward, make him progress, and succeed.</p>
<h3>Journalism</h3>
<p>— Gang</p>
<p>The telegraph editor told a rural correspondent that in the future, articles must not omit the names of news figures, otherwise he would be fired.</p>
<p>A few days later, the editor received a telegram:</p>
<p>"Kangzhuang, 10th - This afternoon, there was a heavy thunderstorm here. Lightning struck the barbed wire of Wilson's pasture, killing three cows. Their names are Jinhua, Haitang, and Fengzhi."</p>
<h3>Catching Shadows</h3>
<p>— Mao Yi</p>
<p>A woman fainted in the street and was helped into a pharmacy. As a result, people on the street gathered around, and latecomers eagerly asked, "What happened?" The matter became somewhat mysterious, and people began to spread rumors that the bank across the street had been robbed.</p>
<p>A few minutes later, an ambulance called by the woman arrived, and police officers pushed through the crowd and entered the bank. Finally, people began to wonder why they were standing there. But no one knew.</p>
<p>At this time, the woman who had fainted recovered her energy and walked out of the pharmacy. Seeing such a large crowd, she asked people what had happened.</p>
<p>"Something happened at the bank," said a pedestrian.</p>
<h3>Strange Contract</h3>
<p>— Leng Leng</p>
<p>A wealthy man in France made a contract with a bohemian and nihilistic youth, stipulating that the youth must live alone in a closed dark room for fifteen years. The dark room was full of famous philosophical books for fifteen years of reading. The rich man was responsible for providing three meals a day, and was not responsible for anything else. After the expiration of the period, all the property would be given to the youth. Leaving the dark room even one step halfway would be regarded as a breach of contract, and there would be nothing. And the youth should issue another proof, stating that the rich man was not involved in the case of death or suicide due to illness during the period. There was also an addendum that if the rich man died for some reason during the performance of the contract, the youth would immediately have the right to obtain all the property.</p>
<p>When it began to be implemented for a few months, the servant who delivered the meals saw the youth singing loudly all day long, and then he browsed the books silently. After a considerable period of time, he talked to himself hysterically and talked eloquently. In the third year, the youth seemed to be working hard, referring to books, and working hard to write. After ten years, until the thirteenth year, the rich man unfortunately died of illness. The consulting lawyer followed the will and respectfully invited the youth to leave the room to open the vault together and accept the property. Unexpectedly, it was already empty. It turned out that the youth had become a profound philosopher after studying hard for several years and had written several special books. He felt that he could not bury himself in the dark room and waste his time, so he resolutely bribed the servant who delivered the meals and escaped. Now he has been honorably appointed as a university professor and is a famous philosophical authority.</p>
<p>The lawyer finally found him and asked him to fulfill the contract. Of course, he refused, and the rich man had no relatives to inherit the property. Therefore, with the consent of both parties, it was decided to donate all the property to public welfare undertakings. So under the supervision of the philosophy professor, the lawyer, and local fair-minded people, the rich man's vault was opened. Unexpectedly, it was empty, with only a note signed by the rich man himself pasted on the door inside the box, simply writing a few words: "Congratulations, you have become a famous philosopher. I know you don't need my property now. Learning, reputation, and status are your only property. I have donated all the property to public welfare undertakings in the name of an anonymous person, and you will definitely agree with my measures. May God bless our philosopher!"</p>
<p>The philosophy professor thanked the rich man for his kindness, and used the rich man's name to set up a scholarship in the university where he taught, to commemorate him forever.</p>

<h3>The Death of Tong Guan</h3>
<p>— Wang Baili</p>
<p>The biography of Tong Guan briefly states: "Guan was influential, and Cai Jing's advancement was due to Guan's efforts. People at the time called Jing the 'Duke Chancellor' and Guan the 'Old Woman Chancellor'. During the Northern Expedition, he started border disputes. The Jin people broke the alliance and went south. Guan was terrified and fled to the capital to escort the Emperor Emeritus to the south, fearing that he would not go fast enough. He was later beheaded in Yingzhou." The official history records this, which is credible. However, according to Lu You's Notes from an Old Study, Guan was executed in Nanxiong Prefecture. The note states: "After Tong Guan received the imperial edict to be executed, the imperial censor Zhang Daming was specially ordered to carry out the order. When he was about to arrive at Nanxiong Prefecture, Guan was there. Daming was afraid that he would hear about it and commit suicide, so he would not be able to clearly administer the criminal law. So he first sent a personal officer to see Guan. When he arrived, he presented his credentials and congratulated him in the courtyard. Guan asked why. He said, 'There is an edict to send a eunuch to bestow tea and medicine, and to summon the Great King to the capital, and I have heard that there is an order to pacify Hebei.' Guan asked if it was true. He replied, 'The generals today are all latecomers and cannot be entrusted. Therefore, the Emperor and the ministers discussed and thought that there was no one like Your Majesty who had prestige, was familiar with border affairs, so there was this order.' Guan was overjoyed and said to his attendants, 'It turns out that they cannot do without me!' The next day, Daming arrived, and Guan was executed." This shows that Guan died in Nanxiong Prefecture, not in Yingzhou, which is explained in detail. According to my research, Nanxiong Prefecture is now Nanxiong County, located on the main road from Guangdong to Jiangxi. The Song History says that Guan was beheaded in Yingzhou, Yingzhou may have been the place where Guan was exiled when he was convicted, not the place where Guan was executed. Looking at the words "When he was about to arrive at Nanxiong, Guan was there" in the Notes from an Old Study, it can be seen that Zhang Daming was originally planning to go to Yingzhou to carry out the appointment when he was ordered to execute Guan. However, when he was about to arrive at Nanxiong, he heard that Guan was there, so he executed him on the spot in Nanxiong, without having to go to Yingzhou again. Moreover, the Song History was written by Tuotuo and others of the Yuan Dynasty, more than a hundred years after Guan's death, and there are bound to be omissions. Lu You was a person of the early Southern Song Dynasty, close to the death of Tong Guan, and what he saw and heard should be more detailed. Therefore, there is no doubt that Tong Guan was executed in Nanxiong Prefecture.</p>
<h3>Carefree Flowers</h3>
<p>— Chen Shengyan</p>
<p>Chapter 9: Leaking Secrets (53)</p>
<p>Qi Wan said, "Your plan is very good, but I still want to use the east and west wing rooms as a gym, preparing a billiard table and a ping-pong table. What do you think?" Zhu Zhai said, "Then paving the platform of the wing room with flower tiles will be even more beautiful." Qi Wan said, "Let's decide that now! Do you know any familiar lumber mills? You can handle everything for me." Zhu Zhai was usually good at planning house furnishings, etc., and was also most interested in it, and agreed readily. From this day on, Zhu Zhai, in addition to going to the bank, ran around for Qi Wan's construction work. He not only went to supervise the work every day, but also planned the colors for the walls and arranged flowers and stones in the courtyard, striving for beauty and sanitation. After the construction work was completed, he was busy installing lights and furnishing furniture, making sure that every room and every item was suitable. Qi Wan was very happy to see that his arrangement was very effective, because she was not very familiar with all of this, and handed it over to Zhu Zhai to handle completely. After two months, an old-fashioned building was transformed by Zhu Zhai into a very artistic building. In these two months, Zhu Zhai ran around for Qi Wan every day, handling construction work and purchasing equipment, etc., almost without any free time. Not only did he not see Feng Sheng there, but he also did not go to Yun Qing's house often. Yun Qing was a careful person, seeing that Zhu Zhai's attitude was becoming more and more indifferent, as if he was interested in someone else. She tried to test him during conversations, but he always avoided it and could not get any information out of him. When she occasionally mentioned the future results of the two, Zhu Zhai always frowned, deeply concerned about his father's hurdle, which was not easy to overcome. Yun Qing carefully observed the situation, and could not think of a good strategy for how to use it in the future to achieve satisfactory results with the elderly. She was worried that Zhu Zhai's expression had changed recently and had to take precautions. Whenever she saw that Zhu Zhai had not come for two days, she would call the bank dormitory to inquire, and sometimes even asked him to come home for dinner. Zhu Zhai was given such a runaround by her, and had a situation of losing sight of the other, and was very depressed in his heart. He repeatedly expressed to Qi Wan that it would be better to hold our wedding sooner, and a traveling wedding would be the most trouble-saving, but Qi Wan paid no attention to this point, thinking that such a procedure was too hasty. Since she had divorced Feng Sheng, there was no legal problem, and she could get married whenever she wanted. Seeing that Zhu Zhai did not pay attention to her meaning, and could not tell her the suffering completely, his heart was just embarrassed. One day, after Zhu Zhai got off work, he went to Qi Wan's new house and went with Qi Wan to the East City to look for carpets, because almost everything in Qi Wan's new house had been arranged, only the large carpet in the living room had not been settled. The walls of the living room were light blue, and according to Zhu Zhai's idea, the carpet had to be dark blue to match, but it was not easy to find a dark blue carpet of the right size for Qi Wan's living room in many places. This day, introduced by a colleague from the bank, they went to the Xinyi Carpet Shop in the East City and saw a blue carpet. Zhu Zhai hurriedly made an appointment with Qi Wan to go to the East City to buy it together when he got off work, but Yun Qing called him several times to ask him to go.</p>
