<p>〔中央社北平廿九日電〕國防部政工局長鄧文儀，廿九日下午五時出席華北剿總定例記者招待會，分析目前戰局稱：國軍爲打擊匪之秋季攻勢，並適用新戰略，不浪費兵力，最近在表面上放棄甚多地方；或有認爲國軍失利者，然若國軍於集中主力後爭取決戰勝利，則失地終必收復。鄧氏强調應自主力決戰之勝敗方面觀察今後剿匪戰事，並指出今日決非黨與黨之爭或單純之「內戰」，賓爲關係民族存亡之戰爭，故必須啓發政治經濟及社會所有力量，爭取軍事勝利。鄧氏復報吿全國各地戰况稱：（一）匪之「秋季攻勢」，開始已兩閱月，其重點則在東北，該匪之兵力數倍于我，自佔優勢；我錦州守軍爲兩個軍，匪則爲五個縱隊，長春亦然；故以上二地，均先後放棄，一匪在錦州死傷達四萬人。現營口一已收復，潘陽營口間亦經打通。匪以攻錦州之力調往遼西大虎一山黑山，計有一·二·三·八。十二及兩個獨立師，較該方面國軍多一倍以上，戰鬥異常激烈，國軍決盡最大力量，保衛潘陽。營口及錦西，以圖發展，東北局勢之挽回，自尙須艱苦努力。（二）匪之「秋季攻勢」除東北外，則注重華中，陳毅匪部竄陷濟南後，匪損失亦大，約在九萬五千人以上，反之，國軍在濟僅五六萬人，匪實得不償失。陳毅惟恐國軍北上收復濟南，故在魯西積極構築工事，並企圖越隴海路竄犯蘇北，而國軍爲打擊匪之主力，已自鄭州開封主動撤離，不受匪之牽制，免使兵力分散，最近在豫皖蘇魯邊界地區，可能與匪作一決戰。（三）華北方面，聶匪分三股流竄，一股在平漢綫，一股察東，另股綏遠；最近平綏東段關溝作戰結果，匪死傷萬餘，國軍則三四千人，足以說明匪之力量有限。（四）華中方面，劉伯承匪部聲援陳毅匪部，與轟匪在華北聲援東北牽制國軍如出一轍；劉匪所部不及十個縱隊，散居平漢綫及豫西一帶，今則其第二·第六·第十等三個縱隊已被國軍全部擊潰。（五）西北方面，彭德懷匪部圖牽制國軍增援山西，自本月分八九兩日流竄關中，經國軍於十日·十一日·十二日攻擊，匪傷亡約在兩萬五千人以上，換言之，卽彭匪之五個縱隊被打垮一個半縱隊後損失約三分之一强·</p>

<p>〔中央社南京廿九日電〕監察院經資濟源農林水利委會，財政糧政委會及內政地政委會聯席會議，對當前經濟情勢所提出之糾正案，已於廿九日由監院咨送政院，該案案由爲：「行政當局執行財經改革方案，方法錯誤，步伐紊亂，造成今日生產减縮，貨物逃避，銀根鬆濫，無市與黑市之嚴重現象，應予糾正，原案略謂：查政府頒行財政經濟緊急措施辦法，旨在穩定物價，安定民生，而實施以來，未及三月，已見生產萎縮，物資逃避，搶購風熾，黑市猖獗諸現象，且情勢日趨普遍與嚴重，茲就應行從速挽救各點，提請注意：</p>
<p>（一）財政經濟緊急措施，硬性凍結八一九各種物價，而各地政治效率未能配合經濟措施，以致食糧與民生日用必需物品價格產區高於銷區，原料高於成本，其結果，銷區日用物品以及工厰所需原料來源枯竭，影響所及，生產乃至萎縮，釀成槍購無市與黑市猖獗等惡劣親象。</p>
<p>（二）凍結物價之後，物資逃匿，料所難免，政府自宜體察此一事實發生之可能，應早有所預防，尤其對於人民生活必需物品如食糧，油，監，燃料，布匹等項，有關主管部門應妥爲統籌，寬策來源，力加控制，乃迄今數月，仍未見控制與調節物資之有效辦法。</p>
<p>（三）金圓劵發行後，政府對於游資之出路，未能積極疏導，而所收兌民間之外鈔金銀，又未能卽速妥善遝用。又國營事業股券之出售，銀行錢莊之增資，敵偽產業之處理，均未能切實迅速有效執行，致使民間持有之金圓券變爲大量游資，銀根鬆濫，影響幣信，打擊物價，釀成市面恐慌。</p>
<p>（四）經濟緊急措施原訂方案，於黄金白銀之收兌與法幣之行使，皆有一定限期，而中途忽將金銀收兌之日期延長，政府以控制金銀爲增加金圓券發行之手段，而所有金銀外幣黑市之猖獗，物資之逃匿匱乏與搶購現象，皆發生於政府宣吿金銀收兌延期之前後，此種反應，當初是否亦曾料及，並曾否籌劃有效針對可能發生此病之方案。</p>
<p>（五）公敎人負生活困苦，人盡皆知，倘不速謀改救，吏治將無澄淸之日。目前公敎人員生活待遇仍凍結於八一九之標準，而日常生活所需，早已入不數出，近且在搶購中求生，飢餓掙扎，不可終日，影響所及，何堪設想。綜上數端，足見政府未能愼之於初，復未卽時補救於後，執行期中，或不諳悉政策之本旨，或忽視實施之技術，遂致使攸關國計民生之大政策，竟產生如許之惡果，目擊横流，深表遺憾，用特提請糾正。</p>

<p>〔本報南京廿九日電〕立法院第二會期第十五次會議，廿九日舉行，孫院長主席，晨九時半開會，首通過報吿事項十二件，政院咨請審議各法案，分別交付各關係委會審査，繼復聆取臨時報吿事項數起，包括政院對楊公灰前質詢公價處理法不合理之書面答覆及程序委會關於加强議事效率辦法之擬議。旋陳明仙提出臨時緊急動議，列舉辦法十項，擬請決議交付政府執行，以挽救當前經濟危機，解民倒懸，其所列辦法計有：（一）微借豪門資產，充作籲亂經費，（二）徵借大戶囤積物資，平價發售，（三）撥用外匯，向國外購買生活必需品及原料，（四）高價收購匪區物資，並以防止物資外流，（五）控制日用必需品，嚴格施行配給，（六）開放工貸，必供應原料，獎勵加工增產，（七）開放農貸，計劃增產，（八）取消日甩必需品限價，但得提高稅率，以增國庫收入，補貼配給支出，（九）調整國營事業價格，改善管理，减少浪費，（九）提高公敎人員待遇，除實物配給外，並按物價指數予以合理調整。陳氏說明案由及辦法後，各委員卽相繼發言，熟烈討論，尤以對「限價」，「議價」主張不一，頗有爭辯，一部委員並對行政當局作猛烈抨擊，然大多數均不主張作具體決議，藍政府財經緊急措施，全係由總統根據臨時條款以命令頒布，立院不宜中途攬事。最後表決通過，仿上次例會中慍士源等相類臨時動議之處理，再以全院委員名義，向政院提出質詢，至十一時半開始討論事項，十二時散會。</p>

<h3 id="c17">從史達林談話看世界 <a href="#c17" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e17" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">17</a></h3>
<p>蘇聯元首史灰林於廿八日接見眞理報記者，答覆記者問話，對於蘇聯現行政策有所闡明。綜合史氏談話的內浴，有下列各要點：（一）預料新的世界大戰沒有爆發的可能。（二）譴責英美企圖憑藉其「侵略政策」而發動新的世界大戰，但謂「新的戰爭的煽動者最後必歸於失敗。」（三）對於英美法將柏林問題訴諸安全理事會，視爲西方盟國所做出的「侵略表現」。（四）對於安理會中六個中立國，也認爲他們支持英美的侵略政策。（五）透露莫斯科談判討論柏林問題，曾兩次獲致協議，但因英美並不眞心願意與蘇聯協議與合作，故談判未能成功。</p>
<p>史達林平時很少接見記者，且不輕易發表談話，記得他爲了要支持華萊士競選總統，曾於五月十七日接見記者，表示贊成華萊土所提出的美蘇合作計劃，稱之爲美蘇進行談判解除意見紛歧的「良好而有希望的基礎」。現在隔了五個多月，發表這一次的談話，自有其重要的作用，尤其在環球氣壓低沉人心惶惑的今天，格外値得我們的重視。</p>
<p>美蘇之間的「冷戰」，愈演愈烈，不僅使世界的兩極化更加分明，而且「冷戰」也將流血發熱，可能變爲眞正的戰爭了。聯合國大會在巴黎夏樂宮中舉行，旣不能挽回國際的逆流，反使東西兩極間的「結」，愈結愈緊。英美指摘蘇聯封鎖柏林足以危及世界和平，而蘇聯則又譴責英美爲「戰爭販子」，「新的戰爭的煽動者」。雙方不但爭論不休，並繼之以行動。最近一個月來，我們看到國際上的一速串的事實：一方面有西歐五國設立聯防總部，推舉英國陸軍參謀長蒙哥梅萊元帥爲西歐聯軍最高統帥，並將與美國加拿大進行談判，締結七國北大西洋軍事同盟條約。英帝國會議時，各自治領均以防務不固爲憂，今後也將各自努力重整軍備。另一方面，則有東歐聯盟的醞釀，蘇聯積極進行加强其在鐵幕內地位的工作：在蘇聯國內更集中全力建造龐大的潛水艇隊，以備萬一。此外，法國工潮的擴大，南韓發生叛變，東南亞各國的動亂，中國共匪騷擾的蔓延，以及一切的一切，均顯示出國際局勢的緊張，不營一夕數驚，大有山雨欲來風滿樓之勢，因此，使戰後餘生的世人，英不惶惑於今日的世界是否又到了戰爭爆發的邊緣？</p>
<p>以常識來判斷，第二次大戰的血跡未乾，凡是稍有理性和良知的人，不論是蘇聯及其鐵幕內各國的人民，或是英美及其他民主國家的人民，痛定思痛，只要不忘第二次大戰慘痛的敎訓，誰都不會歡迎國際戰爭的。今日美國雖有「預防戰爭」的呼聲，輿論界也一致反對政府對蘇聯採取「綏靖政策」，但决非欲立卽揭開第三次大戰的血幕之謂。在蘇聯方面，她雖在世界各地散佈動亂的種子，造成全世界的騷動不安，但由她本身的利害言，在蘇聯沒有造成原子彈以前，也决不願於此時輕肇戰禍的。現在，我們從史達林的談話看來，也可知史達林此時也還不敢達背人類的理性與良知，公然宣佈蘇聯不辭一戰的。所以，人類愛好和平的理性與良知，實爲今日世界和平唯一的有力保障。</p>
<p>然而第三次大戰儘管今日還未曾到達爆發的邊緣，但如果各方箭抜弩張，久而久之，也可弄假成眞的。幸賴人類愛好和平的理性與良知，此時還能促使任何人不敢輕肇戰禍。從史達林的談話看世界，使我們相信，今日的世界雖在千災萬難之中，但卽謂第三次大戰不久就要爆發，不免言之過早吧。</p>

<h3 id="c40">史達林對柏林問題聲明　美斥為言行不符　認為意圖諉卸危機責任 <a href="#c40" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e40" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">40</a></h3>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓廿九日電〕史灰林所發表關於柏林糾紛之談話，美官方對之頗為冷淡。國務院僅作簡短之聲明，謂蘇聯所指示各節，已由四强在莫斯科談判柏林問題失敗後，西方國家於九月廿六日所發表之白皮書所證明不確。國務院新聞聯絡官麥克德膜稱，「吾人將不加以評述，白皮書爲一切經過之完整與眞實的記錄。」</p>
<p>〔合衆社倫敦廿九日電〕英外交部發言人今日招待記者時，批評史達林之聲明稱，英政府對史違林攻擊安理會六中立國家，「甚表驚奇」。而該六國乃企圖對柏林危機促成妥協者。</p>
<p>〔美國新聞處巴黎廿九日電〕中國發言人稱，「六中立國已竭盡力量，以解除政治之緊張態度。」渠宣稱，「史灰林如稱此舉為戰爭，則亦惟任之而已。」</p>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓廿八日電〕此間人士認爲史灰林之聲明，可能為以下數種目的而發：（一）企圖將目前之危機及朱能灰成妥協之罪咎咎，蹄諸西方國家。（二）聲明東西間之分裂幾乎已無法解決，以散佈戰爭恐怖而造成混亂。（三）以歸罪西方國家而混淆世界舉論。（四）可能係對華萊士之竸選運動，給予最後一分鐘之支援。</p>
<p>〔合衆社巴黎廿九日電〕聯合國西方國家代表團廿九日表示：渠等担心史灰林之譴責西方，爲蘇聯加强東西冷戰之表徵。不但聯合國蘇代表將在辯論柏林問題時加强指斥西方，而且將在全世界展開冷戰。史灰林之聲明使許多代表國驚擾，使渠等放棄及早解決柏林危機之極小希望。史灰林聲明顯已拒絕西方提出在本週初在聯合國以外解決柏林危機之建議。史達林所稱關於西方之侵略政策，及西方國家領袖計劃製造新戰爭，難已屢聞不鮮，莫洛托夫在過去三年來之國際會議中亦頻作此語，但西方代表團所認爲電要者，則爲史達林親自攻擊西方國家，此尙係第一次。過去，當局勢僵化時，西方代表曾屢次要求史氏伸出調和之手，當聯合國代表團於廿九日會晤時，均相互探詢史氏之聲明究係何意？是否表示蘇聯政策之主要改變？或係史灰林放棄與西方妥協之希望？抑係史達林對全世界輿論之反對蘇聯表不不耐？或係聯合國之行動已產生相當效果？無一代表團能解答此等問題。</p>
<h3 id="c41">對以色列制裁建議　安理會延期表決　傳由於杜魯門干涉所致 <a href="#c41" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e41" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">41</a></h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕巴黎廿九日廣播：據負責外交方面稱，杜魯門總統最後一分鐘之干涉，阻止聯合國對壓迫以色列之建議採取行動。安理會將中英聯合建議之表決延至下週二（十一月二日）舉行。美代表團對此項展綏表決，係由杜魯門干涉而促成之消息，旣不證實，亦不否認。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社巴黎廿九日電〕安理會面臨以色列政府正式要求與埃及政府直接談判之後，今晨一致通過加拿大組織特別小組會之提案，以便準備對安理會有關巴勒斯坦決議案之原文加以修正。此一小組會之委員包括中，英，比，法，及鳥克蘭各國代表，並將由代理調解專員彭契協助之。</p>
<p>加拿大之提案在該國代表麥克諾頓指出應使用一切力量，將巴勒斯坦休戰變爲確實之和平後，卽行通過。此案之通過係全然推翻廿八日中英聯合提案，該案要求對犯有罪行的一方，根據憲章實施經濟及其他制裁。在通過加拿大提案前，以色列代表艾本再度猛烈攻擊中英聯合提案，謂該案祗足加劇尼基夫危機，渠並强調稱，安理會現存之唯一任務，厥在下令雙方開始談判確實之和平。安理會將於十一月二日繼續審査巴勒斯坦問題。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社巴黎廿八日霉〕以色列政府今日突然宣佈準備與埃及政府直接或由聯合國調解專員居間開始談判，以廓淸現存於兩國政府間之種種歧見。但據接近埃代表團之各界聲稱，埃及仍將堅持所決定之立塲，不與以色列政府直接談判，因埃及迄未承認以色列政府之存在故也。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社台拉維夫廿八日電〕以色列總理古利翁今日吿議會稱，以色列軍決不退至十月十四日尼基夫戰事開始前之陣地。</p>

<p>〔法國新聞社巴黎廿九日電〕聯大政委會今日開會，以卅四對十一票（五票棄權包括蘇聯在內），通過繼續研究希臘問題直到該問題充分加以辯論以後一案，故今日政委會加以研究之各項間題，線計有下列數項：（一）希臘間題；（二）裁軍問題，（三）巴勒斯坦間題。裁軍小組會今日向各代表提出草案，而硏究巴勒斯坦問題八日之時限將於明日吿一段落。</p>
<p>〔中央社巴黎廿八日電〕蘇聯今提出要求，將駐希臘之全部外國軍隊撤退，並解散聯合國巴爾幹特委會。維予斯基在聯大政委會中重申其一年前之蘇聯立塲時，指責英美干涉希臘。彼認爲該特委會之工作爲一堆垃圾，彼並斷然拒絕中英法美聯合建議，將該特委會延長一年。</p>

<p>〔中央社華盛頓廿八日合衆電〕美國以槪括拒絕蘇聯所提獲知美國在日本各軍事首長十月十二日秘密會議情形之要求。美國所持之理由，爲此非蘇聯之事。美國務院之答復，距蘇駐美大使潘友新向盟國遠東委員會提出上述要求僅數小時。國務院答稱：麥克阿瑟爲太平洋方面美國高級統帥，自可常與高級軍官舉行軍事會議，此乃僅與美國政府有關之例行事務。國務院又稱：潘大使所述，關於横須賀基地一節，全屬子虎。此一基地，向由美海軍用以支持盟國最高統帥貫澈佔領目標，因此關於日本投降後，基本對日政策之遠東決定，遭受遠反之暗示，並無根據。潘氏所述之東京會議，純係例行軍事會議，與報載種種目的不同。</p>

<p>〔法國新聞社莫斯科廿八日電〕史達林打破長久之沉默，今日在眞理報上發表一篇答覆記者詢問之會面文告，譴責西方國家對蘇聯之侵略意向，並故意破壞協定之締結。大部份問答均關於柏林問題與美國之政策，史達林之答語如下：</p>
<p>（一）安理會之討論柏林問題，以及英美代表團之態度，明白表示英美政策之侵略性。（二）關於同時解除交通限制並統一柏林幣制事，西方三國與蘇聯於八月卅日在莫斯科實已獲得協議，此協議並不損害任何人之威信，而尊重雙方之利益，保證進一步合作，然英美政府否定其莫斯科專使之工作，認協議爲無效，而將柏林問題向安理會提出。（三）安理會表決柏林問題前，在巴黎之非正式會議中亦曾獲得解決柏林問題之協議，安理會主席勃拉馬格里亞與維辛斯基會晤後，確有一可使雙方互相商議之決議草案，然英美代表又再度否定是項協議，是以英美之政策顯然不欲協定，亦不欲合作，而僅願空談以掩飾其侵略政策，並　將協議失敗之責任諉諸蘇聯，並誣指與蘇聯合作爲不可能者。戰爭煽動者懼怕與蘇聯眞正締結協定，蓋如此將動搖其煽動戰爭之立塲，西方國家將柏林問題向安理會提出，認爲彼等能控制安理會，而爲所欲爲。史達林强調指出英美目前之政策，「實爲侵略與煽動戰爭之政策」，而中加比阿哥叙等六中立國竟支持「凖備戰爭侵略政策」。史灰林答覆第六項亦卽最後一項問題時稱，「一切惟有引導戰爭煽動者走向可恥之失敗。主要之戰爭煽動領袖邱吉爾，已失去其人民以及全世界民主人士之信任，其他戰爭煽動者亦不能逃避與邱吉爾同樣之命運。全世界人民對戰爭之恐怖記憶猶新，渴求和平之輿論堅强有力，決不使邱吉爾等聲發動另一次對其自身有利之新戰爭」。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕警局經警大隊，自成立金鈔偵査組後，於本”廿七日上午八時起至廿八日中午十二時止，十六小時內，竟通續破獲黑市金鈔鉅案三起。內二起爲有計劃利用國際背景企圖破壞金圓劵信用者，其目的乃在造成金鈔黑市，藉以引起物價狂漲，陷人民生活於絕地，另一起爲曾遭逮捕而經地檢處交保釋出之黑市金鈔四大天王之一沈文杰，雖當塲並無交易行爲，但因査有重大慷疑，亦予逮捕。現三案經該隊詳密偵訊後，已吿一段落，卽將移送特刑庭法辦。茲將破獲經過分誌如下：（一）有英藉僑民（在逃）近受某外商銀行委託，以高價黑市收購大量美鈔，該外僑旋轉託本市中山東路九號三樓美國太平洋企業公司經理王成志辦理，經王向各處搜羅結果，復得識一美僑。旋該美僑即爲經警大隊偵悉，經派員與之連繫，於本月廿七日，卽由該美僑出面電王僞稱有美鈔三千五百元願以金圓七元對美元一元之價格出售，約定當晚八時交割。王未知是計，頗表欣慰。屆時該隊先派組長王恩祖率副組長陳景行陶根榮曁中外幹員前往外灘王成志辦公室附近預爲佈置。同時並派班長樊明新隨該美僑携美鈔凖時前往。詎王亦機警異常，謂金圓劵未放辦公室，請該美僑隨其同往家中一行。旋卽電召出租汽車一輛，偕彼等駛往建國西路五〇六弄十六號。是時預佈之警負見計未售，遂亦以汽車跟踪，至王宅後，王卽赴樓上捧下金圓劵二萬五千元，彼此如數點交畢，王忽復謂此項美鈔存放家中，殊多不便，當將美鈔放置大衣夾層內，再僱車請彼等倍同駛赴襄陽路其親戚家中，迨抵襄陽路，樊班長卽出示身份，同時跟蹤人員亦一併上前，將王及美僑同時帶局，王被捕後，自知無法再辯，卽直認不諱。昨日該隊並根據其供詞，續在某醫院內拘獲共犯楊壽年一名，至在逃英僑刻尙在追緝中。王爲美國哈佛大學曁西點陸軍軍官學校畢業，方於數月前由美國太平洋企業總公司派遣來滬祖任分公司經理之職。</p>
<p>蘇僑受委託高價收美鈔</p>
<p>（一）蘇聯人李文卓夫（B.Liventzoff），住靜安寺路滄洲別凝五號，近受某方委託，亦同樣以高價黑市收購美鈔，企圖搗亂金融。事爲經警大隊偵悉，將計就計，密派外籍幹員往洽，以金圓九元半合美金一元之價格成交美金四千六百元。李信以爲眞，卽携皮箱一只，內儲金圓券四萬三千七百餘元，偕其同車駛往預爲經警佈置之衡山路高恩路附近某公寓前。其時該外籍警員卽上樓携取美鈔四千六百元後，再返車中，正在進行交割時，預伏之警負卽一湧而出，將李拘獲，李知事敗路，猶圖反抗，並擬將付與之現鈔奪回，卒爲經警阻止。經帶局偵訊後亦已直認不諱，惟對其主使人姓名則堅不吐露。昨日經警曾至其寓所搜査，並無所獲，査該處爲渠之妹婿（荷蘭人）私寓，據宅中人稱，對其平時行踪從不過問，惟近日時見其携有鉅量金圓進出云。</p>
<p>利申德三樓有密室機關</p>
<p>（三）天津路五十八號二樓，前利申德紗布號經理沈文杰，曾於本年六月十四日爲經警隊破獲經營黑市金鈔，並抄獲十兩重金條三根，現鈔一億數千萬元，及草帳收據等，經解地檢處後未幾卽交保釋出。最近沈死灰復燃，繼續秘密經營黑市金鈔，經警大隊據報後卽於廿八日上午派組長王恩祖率員前往搜査，當塲雖未發見交易行爲，然在其三樓密室內及裝有夾層之地板·板壁·及坐櫈內抄出涉嫌重大之義豐錢莊支票，及該號賬册往來數字達金圓萬元以上，除將所有罪證攝影外，沈及有關人犯葉星華，張因之，程瀛初等四名，一併帶局拘押偵訊。</p>

<p>自由談敬與畏  吳庸　　嘗謂：昔時民間敬士人，因士人可以做官。更精思之，此語容有未當；與其說是「敬」，不如說是「畏」爲差近事實。因爲昔時士之與仕，相去畢竟只是一步；恁是寒士，但須一且「高中」，卽可一躍而爲費人，實有一種今日物理學上的所謂「潛能」在。故士雖尙未能使人至「敬鬼神而遠之一的地步，然人們預留餘地，不敢去得罪他是實。　　國人是否眞的「主敬」，抑還只是「主畏」，可於十年來人家壁上所縣字畫之變遷驗之。自抗戰以迄於淪陷，更自淪陷以迄於勝利，主人多有屢易其壁上之字畫，以應時勢之需要者。足見當初張掛某公某卿的字畫，未必是敬重他的書法畫藝；今日移去，亦未必是爲了他的書法畫藝已經變質。頗有些人只借書畫以自重，恐是視之如符咒，如鍾進士像的成份居多。爲此輩方便計，不侫建議：何妨將一幅字畫雙面都裱，如此，遇必要時，則只一反手間，壁上面目便可爲之一新，而無重新張掛之勞。　　我們只有「畏」而無「敬」。最足以表明此點的是「神道設敎」之一語。呌我們勿作惡，須爲善，單是說明其中是非是不够的，必須渲染「報應」，「輪廻」，「閻羅」，「日遊神」，「夜遊神」這一套。而這一套實全基於「畏」之一字。甚至對於「神」，我們也是「畏」的成份多，而「敬」的成份少——恐怕根本就沒有。卽使是「岳老爺」「關老爺」，也都成了求于祈福的對象，與「敬」乎何有？廟宇前的那一方「誠則靈」，卽說明了使人虔誠，必須以「靈」爲勸。　　原來一敬」乃基於道德感，是非感，大致可說是情感方面的；而「畏」却是基於個人的利害觀念，是偏於理智的。大約我們的感覺是鈍於是非，而敏於利害。對我們「曉以大義」，往往難以生效，但「動以利害」，却是常能其響如應。馴至心頭懷着一種不自覺的觀念：凡有利於己者必是，而有損於己者必非。故古有「侯之門，仁義存」之歎，而今又有「有條卽有理」之論。夫輕是非，則雖善不敬；甫利害，則雖惡畏之。　　我們之所以「貌爲恭敬」者，不論是對人或神，其消極的作用是免得開罪於對方，積極的目的則是在求有利於一己。對於無從加害於我，或不能有利於己者，縱使可敬，非但不敬，抑且從而加害之，欺罔之，必强其有利於己而後已。我們是個情感極爲缺乏的民族。　　因爲我們對於可敬之事不敬，人們就不想做可敬的人了，因爲我們深畏可畏之人，人們自然就有志於做令人生畏的事了。我們常把「敬」「畏」二字聯用，然以着眼之重點在後者而不在前者，致其產生於人心方面的效果，徑庭歧異有如此。如何解除困難  如意　　最近三年來，美國哈佛大學的童漢敎授（Wallace　Brett　Donbam日）聯合了其他大學裏志同通合的學者們，專門從事於「人類關係學」的研究。所謂「人類關係學」，是一門新的學科，卽係由童氏等創立，道學科硏究的主題是；怎樣和別人相處。　　他們曾搜集了許多的材料，歸納出十項「如何解除困難」的原則。我國是一個着重「人治」的國家，人事間的磨擦幾已成爲任何一個團體中必有的事情，因此而焦頭爛額者大有人在，因譯出以供大家參考：　　（一）凡遭逢困難時，必須對這個難題的各方面加以澈底的硏究，以期明瞭其瘤結所在，然後再籌劃解決困難的辦法。硏究這難題時，應當儘量聽取各方面的意見多聽別人；自己少說。　　（二）要明瞭「全局」的形勢；切不可祇看了問題的一小部份就採取行動。　　（三）不要爲「理論」所蔽。人與人之間的問題。有許多是和感情有關的，而人類的感情却常常不能單以理論來解釋。　　（四）注意「字」和「句」的涵義，要從宇裘行間探求出別人眞正的用意。　　（五）不必常常下「是非」的結論。一個問題若未經眞正澈底的硏討，「是非」是極難斷定的。　　（六）常常設身處地爲別人着想　　（七）如果當前的難題實在無法解決，那麽乾脆把它暫時丢開，一點也不要去想它。隔了一個星期再來研究，有時解決的辦法會「得來全不費功夫」的。　　（八）常常問一問你自己：「別人爲甚麽要這樣做？他受了誰的影響？」　　（九）先分析，然後行動。要照醫生的辦法，必須先詳細硏究致病的原因，然後才能處方。　　（十）不要慌，慢慢的來。心急慌忙的行動往往會引起新的糾紛。應當從從容容的考慮，從從容容的行動。聽雨  朱蘭客　　重陽已過，滿城風雨，正是持螯賞菊的時候。我最愛秋色的平淡，尤其留戀秋天的雨景，因爲它寧靜悠閑，從容不迫，淡雅秀麗，若有若無，引起我無限的迷惘與憧憬。它又如同晚唐溫李的詩，大米小米的畫，空濛曖昧，濃淡咸宜，永遠保持着一種色彩調和境界恬靜的風格。　　秋雨最宜於聽，李義山早已說過：「留得殘荷聽雨聲」。李三郎聽到了雨中的鈴聲，而作出了有名的「雨霖鈴曲」。女詞人李淸照聽到了梧桐上的雨聲，而產生了勝過「簾捲西風，人比黄花瘦」的名句「梧桐更兼細雨，到黄昏，點點滴滴，這次第，只一個愁字了得。」才人納蘭容若因聽雨而寫出了他的名句「風也蕭蕭，雨也蕭蕭，瘦盡燈花又一宵。」其他如境界優美的名句「茂陵秋雨病相如」，詞句妍婉的元劇「梧桐雨」，都是與秋雨有關的作品，多得不勝枚舉。由此可知秋雨激發詩人文士靈感的力量是多麼的大。　　秋雨不像夏季陣頭雨的傾盆直瀉，它老是那麼細弱溫和，淅瀝不斷，敲在窗上，助長凄淸孤寂之思，　在竹葉上，蕭疎凄凉，滴在芭蕉上，惹恨添愁。空階雨聲，更使人輾轉反側，長夜不寐，山林野刹中的雨聲，會使人萬念俱寂，飄然有塵外之感，秋雨的聲音，好像一曲和諧柔緩的古樂，高低仰揚，輕重疾徐，都有一種自然的節奏，你如果靜坐窗前，便可以細細的領會出：什麼是「銀瓶乍破」，什麽是「鐵騎突出」，什麽是「幽谷之潛蛟」，什麽是「孤舟之姦婦」，而獲得無窮盡的聯想所得到的美感　　秋燈夜雨，與知己數人，促膝畏談，共話西窗，又別是一種樂趣。有時漏盡更深，獨坐聽雨，「殘漏聲催秋雨急」，最容易回想到往事。十年前冒雨登金焦二山的情景，前年秋天斜風細雨中在斷橋殘雪遠眺湖景，以及玄武湖的烟雨迷濛，莫愁湖的凄風苦雨，黄鵠磯頭的烟波浩森，苦雨年前雨中與友人騎驢遊靈谷寺的詩情畫意，一幕又一幕，不停的在眼前變幻，身處斗室之中，神遊千里之外，一刹那心靈與雨聲的交織，悠長而仔細的聽着——一直等到聽不見的時候，才猛然淸醒過來。　　秋窗聽雨的時候，境界最爲恬靜，所以這時可以盡情讀愛讀的書畫，寫愛寫的詩文，或者作其他愛作的事，旣沒有酬酢的煩擾，也沒有案牘的勞形，你可以悠閑的躺在窗前的沙發上，對着幾枝黄花，斟上一杯美酒，愛吸烟的可以抽上一枝烟，愛品茗的可以沏上一壺好茶，假如沒有什麽「催租人」光臨的話，這時的情景，決不會比陶公的「採菊東籬下，悠然對南山」遜色。同時，我想，潘大臨「滿城風雨近重陽」的斷句，也一定可以續得下去的吧。「奇巧數字」的秘密  鎬生　　關於本刊昨載幼源君之「奇巧的數字」一文，乍看確能使人生奇特之感，並且把一連串大人物列出來，好像這的確該是「命數」了。　　其實仔細的研究一下，這祇是人爲的非常聰明的安排而已。因爲出生年份加上年齡當然等於一九四四，而他們起始執政的年份加上執政年數也非等於一九四四不可，二一者相加，就是三八八八了身份證  索貝　　衆所週知：今日之下，凡屬市民，無不與「身份證」相依爲命，但試看連日各大報的分類廣吿欄，却又好像大家對身份證特別輕視或特別健忘；是故廿四小時之內，不約而同遺失身份證者，無慮數百名。看樣子，最近幾天內，仍要大量的整批的遺失。　　顯而易見，此所謂「遺失」，純屬人爲，蓋黄牛之流（或瘋狂搶購者），證上早已印鑑累累，乃聽說新發配購證時，要扣除舊證所已買之物資，由是眉頭一縐，計上心來，恰好大家的「智慧」都不相上下。於是你也遺失，我也遺失，大家都遺失了！　　我建議：凡在近半月遺失身份證者，延遲發給新配購證！　　身份證要換發了，許多未領的人，爭先拍照，不惜排隊等候三天，也所情願；以大家對公民身份之重視，足證民智水準已大大提高。卽使說都爲了那配購證才肯出此，但究竟亦屬　有權利，似可不必非議。　　但値得硏究者：戶口米舉辦已數月於茲，難道那些排成長蛇陣等候拍照領證的平民，以前居住上海，竟未報戶口，而放棄配米？難道上海竟有如許人等未有戶籍？　　顯然，那些照相館門口排隊的人，除掉少數難胞以外，一定還有許多從外鄉不遠數十里而特來排隊，拍照，領證的人。目的何在，不在話下！　　我担憂二新配購證發後，民食調配會將要增加配米量百分之若干，而這些增加的數量，不是被吃掉而是被賣掉的！易順鼎軼事  陳詒先　　龍陽易順鼎（實甫，又字哭厂）幼有神童之稱，長有才子之名，乃近代文人中之怪傑也，茲記其軼事數則如後。　　順鼎四五歲時，陷於太平軍中，爲僧格林沁所獲，見其貌淸秀，不類農家子，詢之，順鼎能寫出其父與己之名，僧王大異之，抱之坐轎中歸，交地方官專差送之還家·順鼎九歲進學，十五歲中舉，進學覆試，學台特出「得天下英才而敎育之」題，順鼎文中兩大股收句有曰：「顧安得廣厦萬間，一洗茅星秋風之歎也。（用杜詩典）……顧安得中流砥柱，障狂瀾滄海而東也。」以九歲幼童能寫出如此句子，不能不謂之神童。　　淸季，順鼎在故鄉（長沙）得淮鹽局總辦差，坐四人轎，一日轎停在家中，爲其父（笏山，名佩紳）所見，問是誰的。家人答是五少爺的，其父大怒，命將轎子打出去。（淸代四轎非小官所能坐。）但順鼎將四轎停放於家附近，仍安學如故。新年貼一春聯於淮鹽局大門日：「報國有何能，心戀九重依魏闕。恤商無別法，腰纏十萬上揚州。」對仗工穩，非才子莫辦。　　民初袁世凱作總統時，順鼎曾任印鑄局參事，局長爲余友袁伯躉（思亮）兄，順鼎初見局長，作一長揖營；「在君家兩世爲屬吏。」蓋順鼎任廣欽廉道時，伯　之尊人樹動任兩廣總督也。伯藥請假回鄕播墓，順鼎代理局長，有友人向之謀事，之謀事，順鼎覆書有句曰：「偶爾題作木居士，小僧本無降福之權；爲他人作嫁衣裳，貧女仍是縫窮之命。」又是絕妙文字。　　民初順鼎在故都捧坤伶鮮靈芝，劉喜奎，而捧喜奎尤力，有其詩爲誰：「我願將身化爲紙，喜奎更衣能染指。我願將身化爲布，裁作喜奎護襠褲。」順鼎每日與羅瘦公數名士過喜奎家一次，入門脫箱，必狂呼：「我的親娘，我又來了。」喜奎拜順鼎爲師父，日習藝文，喜奎曾言：「易先生見面，呼我爲娘，我見面呼彼爲父，豈不兩相作抵。」劉禺生洪憲紀事詩，有「騾馬街南劉二家，白頭詩客戴生涯，入門脫帽狂呼母，天女屬然一散花」一首，卽錄此事也。海紅樓詞  半夢　　念奴嬌和友人韻　　滿身是骨，撑不起，萬里風霜奔走·八載高樓，誰伴我？破畫殘書臏酒。爭奈年來，米珠薪桂，文字都芻狗。吞悲飲恨，仰天淸嘯昂首·細數千古興亡，英雄眞草草，而今在否？石馬荒陵，猶認他，血漬塵封苔繡。生死空花，蓋棺携不去，繁華豪富，俊游長阻，笑人江月依舊。　　虞美人題畫　　一鞭殘照奇峯裹，鶴唳孤雲起。淸秋無際萬山紅，恰又飛來黄葉呌西風。團瓢十笏拋心住，痛懺平生誤，文魚寂馨拜空王，剪斷柔情，甚處著廻腸！社會服務讀者諮詢法律釋疑　離婚不成又賦同居　使君有婦豈能再婚　　〔湯松榮君問〕敝戚某女士去年與某君訂婚，最近發覺某君在抗戰前曾與一女子結婚，抗職爆發後某君卽往後方，數月後該女子卽與他人同居，某君在後方知悉，亦不加顧問·最近因欲與敝戚結婚，擬回該女子提出離婚要求，而未獲如願，孰料離婚不成，又吿同居。敝戚屢加質詢，某君始終恍惚其詞。茲有問題數則，請賜答爲感（一）某女士可否依據法律，提出解約？（二）可否提出賠償要求？（三）某君是否負法律之責任？（四）可否依法律起訴？　　〔朱亞揆律師答〕（一）可依據民法第九百七十六條第一項卽婚約訂定後，再與他人訂定婚約或結尋訪孫吉玉　　學生孫忠江，一名與川，流亡來滬，現住自忠路山東會館國華中學，亟欲找尋其叔孫吉王與孫吉才，讀者中有知孫君者，希轉爲告知幸甚！婚者得提出解除婚約。（二）可依照民法第九百七十七條卽婚約解除時，過失之一方得向有過失之他方請求賠償其因此所受之損害。（三）應受民事上之責任。（四）可。服務簡報　　讓書　商務戰前版丙種辭源一部，欲購職者函安遠路恒安里三號朱君洽。　　讓書　莎士比亞全集（英文，皮面燙金）及物理學全集（日文，九册），欲購者請至陜西北路二八七弄四號張君治。　　交大學生求職周華（工學院），張立本（土木系），張國權（工學院），張林（工學院），徐薰陶（工學院）等五人，願於課餘担任數理家庭敎師，聘請者請函徐家匯交通大學治。</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper, Shenyang, 29th Dispatch] Shenyang has entered a tense stage. A curfew began at 5:00 PM. Approximately two columns of bandits were discovered outside the north suburb, and approximately two columns of bandits were discovered outside the east suburb. The defending troops are on high alert. National troops in Shenyang, in order to defend Shenyang, have departed from Xinmin. The bandits are crossing the Liao River eastward. The area surrounding Shenyang will become the final battleground between the National troops and the bandits. Shenyang's mopping-up troops are conducting counterattacks on the north and east sides. Tanks and cavalry have been mobilized, and the air force is conducting constant reconnaissance and bombing, especially at night. Military vehicles are constantly moving within Shenyang. Merchants and residents are calmly awaiting good news. Although there are reactionary slogans in the city, it is very peaceful. The battle in the eastern suburbs was quite favorable at night, and the tanks have moved to other locations.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Shenyang, 29th Dispatch] The situation in Tieling, north of Shenyang, was unclear on the 28th.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Shenyang, 28th Dispatch] The large-scale battle between the National troops in western Liaoning and the main force of the bandits is becoming increasingly fierce. The scope of the battlefield has slightly shrunk, and the battlefield has also slightly shifted. Both sides of the Liao River will be the center of the battlefield, and Shenyang is also part of the battle. In order to concentrate forces, the National troops left Xinlitun on the 27th to attack the bandits to the east. Currently, both sides are fiercely fighting in the area east of Xinmin, Dahushan, and Xinlitun. The fighting north of Shenyang is extremely fierce. The Bandit Independent Fourth and Independent Sixth Divisions are fiercely attacking the National troops' defenses. Furthermore, the Twelfth Column has also joined the attacks. On the night of the 27th, over a thousand bandits fiercely attacked Magujiazi, 15 kilometers north of Shenyang, and the Hushitai Station on the China Changchun Railway. Fierce fighting is still ongoing. On the night of the 27th, the artillery north of Shenyang demonstrated its power. The rumbling sound did not stop all night. From the afternoon until the night of the 28th, the artillery fire was even louder. Shenyang city has long been fully prepared and has set up a position to eliminate the bandits.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Shenyang, 29th Dispatch] The bandits in western Liaoning are using the mountainous terrain around Heishan to put up stubborn resistance. A total of nearly ten thousand have been killed or wounded. On the 29th, the bandits concentrated approximately nine columns of troops to counterattack. In order to lure the bandits away from the mountains, the National troops have shifted to the Baqibao area for confrontation.</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper, Xi'an, 29th Dispatch] The defensive war in Taiyuan City is at a critical juncture. Several buildings in the city have been destroyed by bandit artillery fire. A large building belonging to a large company in Dongguan caught fire on the 28th after being hit by artillery fire, burning fiercely. The National troops defending the city are still fighting hard. Furthermore, official and commercial telegrams between here and Taiyuan are flowing smoothly without obstruction.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Taiyuan, 29th Dispatch] The bandits invading Taiyuan have suffered heavy casualties since launching their second general offensive on the 26th, due to the National troops attacking them fiercely from all sides. In the Xiaoyaotou battle on the 26th, the bandits suffered over two thousand deaths and injuries. Including the bandit casualties in Danaoshan and Zhaohushan, the total number of bandit deaths and injuries reached over four thousand. Therefore, their offensive was thwarted again. On the night of the 28th, aside from a local fierce battle in Xiacencun, about twenty li northeast of the city, and repeated fierce attacks on Zaoyuan and Heituo in the southeast of the city, other areas were relatively quiet. Approximately one regiment of bandits attacking Xiacencun began their fierce assault on our positions at 7:30 PM on the 28th. After fierce fighting until around 11:00 PM, the bandits broke through our positions. However, the National troops reinforcements arrived and wiped out all the bandits who had broken through. The bandits attacking Zaoyuan and Heituo launched three fierce assaults, but were eventually repelled by the defending troops. The bandits left behind seventy corpses. The National troops in the southern suburbs launched an attack against the bandits in the area south of Yangjiabu and Wucheng, completely destroying the bandit fortifications.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Taiyuan, 29th Dispatch] A certain unit of the National troops has repeatedly performed outstanding feats in the defensive war in Taiyuan. Yesterday, they captured the Xiaoyaotou heights, fifteen li east of the city, stabilizing the situation in Taiyuan. After receiving the report, Director Yan Xishan awarded a "Ever Victorious Army" banner, five thousand cans of beef, and 15 billion Legal Tender Yuan to encourage them.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Baoding, 29th Dispatch] Confirmed news: The National troops in the northern section of the Pinghan Railway have proactively launched the winter offensive. A large army moved south along the Pingshi Railway, suppressing the remaining bandits in the mountainous areas of Mancheng and Wanxian and the Jizhong area. On the 28th, fierce battles raged day and night on both sides of the Tang River. A part of the Bandit Seventh Column and the Bandit Independent Regiments of various counties were completely defeated, with over 1,500 bandits killed or wounded and 200 bandits captured. This was the first victory since the launch of the offensive. Currently, the combined infantry, cavalry, and air force are still searching for the main force of the bandits in the hilly areas on both sides of the Pingshi Railway. According to military news, the National troops captured Yujiazhuang and Fangshunqiao south of Baoding yesterday. The National troops advancing south along the Baoshi front are now advancing around Wangdu, demolishing bandit fortifications and organizations along the way, eliminating scattered bandits, searching for groups of bandits, and launching surprise attacks on the bandit base areas to expand the suppression.</p>

The battle area included the villages of Xiaozhai, Xiaogudian, and Taipingzhuang on both sides of the Pinghan Railway. Our brave iron-winged units provided air support. After four hours of fierce fighting, the National troops defeated the two brigades of the bandit army in one go and captured Fangshunqiao.</p>

<p>[Central News Agency, Chengde, 29th Dispatch] The North China剿總 recently distributed a "Letter to Bandit Rural Cadres" in western Hot River, citing the truth of the recent disastrous defeat of the Nie bandits and the grievances of veteran cadres such as Chen Shaoyu, Su Penghe, and Niu Yinguang who were squeezed out and sacrificed, calling on the bandit cadres to broaden their horizons, come over to the bright side, and show that the government is broad-minded and does not hold past actions against them. The letter also clarifies the purpose of suppressing the rebellion, which is not to protect wealthy farmers or implement a new land policy, but to aim at "land to the tillers," urging the blindly following bandit cadres to lay down their knives, return home, wait to be granted land, and enjoy farming. The Hot River Provincial Government is cooperating with this purpose and has selected Sanliugou to implement land reform first, and is also promoting the "Two-Five Rent Reduction." The Suiyuan District Headquarters has specially established a Youth Training Team to accommodate surrendered bandit soldiers and bandit cadres. Their living conditions are comparable to those of the National troops and are very comfortable. Upon completion of the training, they will be appropriately settled or given funds to return to their hometowns. To date, there have been several hundred people. The captured personnel of the pseudo-Longhua County Government have also been sent to the team for preferential treatment as usual. Those who brought weapons and surrendered are not uncommon.</p>

<p>[Central News Agency, Beiping, 29th Dispatch] Deng Wenyi, Director of the Political Warfare Bureau of the Ministry of National Defense, attended the regular press conference of the North China剿總 at 5:00 PM on the 29th and analyzed the current war situation, stating: In order to counter the bandits' autumn offensive and apply new strategies, the National troops are not wasting their strength and have recently abandoned many places on the surface. Some may think that the National troops are losing, but if the National troops concentrate their main force and strive for a decisive victory, the lost territory will eventually be recovered. Deng emphasized that the anti-bandit war from now on should be observed from the perspective of the victory or defeat of the main force decisive battle, and pointed out that today is definitely not a struggle between parties or a simple "civil war," but a war concerning national survival. Therefore, it is necessary to unleash all political, economic, and social forces to strive for military victory. Deng also reported on the war situation in various parts of the country, stating: (1) The bandits' "autumn offensive" has been underway for two months, and the focus is in the Northeast, where the bandits' strength is several times that of ours, giving them an advantage. The Jinzhou garrison consists of two armies, while the bandits have five columns. The same is true for Changchun. Therefore, both places have been abandoned one after another. The bandits suffered 40,000 casualties in Jinzhou. Yingkou has now been recovered, and the area between Shenyang and Yingkou has also been cleared. The bandits used the force that attacked Jinzhou to move to Dahushan and Heishan in western Liaoning, totaling one, two, three, eight, twelve, and two independent divisions, more than double the number of National troops in that area. The fighting is extremely fierce. The National troops are determined to do their utmost to defend Shenyang. Yingkou and Jinxi are intended to be developed, but it will still require arduous efforts to restore the situation in the Northeast. (2) In addition to the Northeast, the bandits' "autumn offensive" focuses on Central China. After the Chen Yi bandit troops captured Jinan, the bandits also suffered heavy losses, approximately over 95,000 people. In contrast, the National troops in Jinan numbered only 50,000 to 60,000, so the bandits actually suffered a loss. Chen Yi fears that the National troops will move north to recover Jinan, so he is actively building fortifications in western Shandong and attempting to cross the Longhai Railway and attack northern Jiangsu. In order to strike the main force of the bandits, the National troops have actively withdrawn from Zhengzhou and Kaifeng, without being constrained by the bandits, to avoid dispersing their forces. Recently, a decisive battle may be fought with the bandits in the border area of Henan, Anhui, Jiangsu, and Shandong. (3) In North China, the Nie bandits are fleeing in three groups: one group on the Pinghan Railway, one group in eastern Chahar, and another group in Suiyuan. Recently, the battle in Guangou in the eastern section of the Pingsui Railway resulted in over 10,000 bandit deaths and injuries, while the National troops suffered 3,000 to 4,000 casualties, which is enough to show that the strength of the bandits is limited. (4) In Central China, the Liu Bocheng bandit troops are supporting the Chen Yi bandit troops, which is the same as the Mao bandit troops in North China supporting the Northeast to contain the National troops. The Liu bandit troops number less than ten columns and are scattered in the Pinghan Railway and western Henan. Now, their Second, Sixth, and Tenth Columns have been completely defeated by the National troops. (5) In the Northwest, the Peng Dehuai bandit troops attempted to contain the National troops from reinforcing Shanxi. Since the eighth and ninth of this month, they have been fleeing in Guanzhong. After the National troops attacked on the 10th, 11th, and 12th, the bandits suffered approximately 25,000 casualties. In other words, after Peng's five columns were defeated one and a half columns, they lost about one-third of their strength.</p>

<h3 id="e13">Remittances From the Northeast, Entry of Cash into Customs, the Ministry of Finance Formulates Management Measures, Remittances Concentrated in Local Central Banks, No More Than 1,000 Gold Yuan Allowed Per Person <a href="#e13" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c13" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">13</a></h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 29th Dispatch] In order to strengthen economic and financial controls, the Ministry of Finance has formulated five management measures for remittances from Shenyang and other places to the interior and the entry of cash, after considering the actual situation and opinions from various parties: (1) Remittances from Shenyang and other places to the interior will be concentrated in local Central Banks. Other national banks and commercial banks will temporarily suspend the acceptance of remittances to the interior. (2) The total amount of remittances from Shenyang and other places to the interior will be limited to 200,000 Gold Yuan per day, and each remittance shall not exceed 500 Gold Yuan. The exchange rate will be adjusted by the Central Bank at any time according to the difference in prices between the two places. (3) All remitters to the interior should clearly state the names and addresses of themselves and the recipients, as well as the purpose of the remittance, for review. (4) Those who must apply to the Central Bank for an over-the-limit remittance to the interior for legitimate purposes should submit detailed reasons in advance to the Central Bank for review. If it is deemed necessary, the Central Bank may notify them to handle it appropriately. However, the Central Bank should still report to the Ministry on a monthly basis for record. (5) The amount of cash that can be transported into Customs from Shenyang and other places shall not exceed 1,000 Gold Yuan per person. Violators will have the excess amount deposited in a special account in the local Central Bank, and a three-month certificate of deposit will be issued, which will be returned upon maturity. The above regulations apply equally to money houses and banks. As for the review standards for remittances, the so-called legitimate purposes should meet the following requirements: (A) If banks or money houses in Shenyang and other places have outstanding balances with branches or counterparts in other places due to past transactions that have not been made up, they must submit account statements to prove it. (B) If commercial firms and manufacturers in Shenyang and other places purchase daily necessities or production raw materials and equipment from other places and must remit funds, they must have the approval of the Chamber of Commerce or industry association and submit receipts. (C) Those who have obtained a purchase and transportation permit for the food industry approved by the Ministry of Food, or grain merchants who have been contacted by the Ministry of Food to purchase grain, and remit funds to purchase grain in the interior, should report to the local Social Bureau for certification. (D) Public employees and officers and soldiers in Shenyang and other places may be allowed to remit two-thirds of their salary income on a monthly basis, but it must be verified that their dependents are indeed in the interior. Remittances from officers and soldiers should also be handled in accordance with the measures formulated by the Four-Organization Joint Office. Remittances from public employees should still be certified by the authorities of the affiliated institutions and schools, and they should be responsible for the overall application.</p>

<h3 id="e15">Control Yuan Proposes Economic Corrective Action, Message to Executive Yuan Urging Saving the Serious Situation <a href="#e15" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c15" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">15</a></h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 29th Dispatch] The joint meeting of the Economic Resources, Agriculture, Forestry, and Water Conservancy Committee, the Finance and Grain Policy Committee, and the Interior and Land Policy Committee of the Control Yuan has sent the corrective action proposed for the current economic situation to the Executive Yuan on the 29th. The reason for the case is: "The administrative authorities have made mistakes in the implementation of the financial and economic reform program, and the steps are chaotic, causing the serious phenomena of reduced production, escape of goods, loose money supply, no market, and black market today. It should be corrected. The original case stated: The government's promulgation of emergency financial and economic measures is aimed at stabilizing prices and ensuring people's livelihood, but since implementation, in less than three months, there have been phenomena of reduced production, escape of materials, panic buying, and rampant black market, and the situation is becoming more widespread and serious. The following points should be paid attention to in order to quickly save the situation:</p>
<p>(1) The emergency financial and economic measures rigidly freeze various prices on August 19, but the political efficiency of various places has failed to match the economic measures, resulting in food and daily necessities prices being higher in production areas than in sales areas, and raw materials being higher than costs. As a result, the sources of daily necessities in sales areas and the raw materials required by factories have dried up, affecting production and even leading to panic buying, no market, and rampant black markets.</p>
<p>(2) After the price freeze, the escape of materials is inevitable. The government should have realized the possibility of this fact and should have taken precautions early. Especially for the necessities of people's lives, such as food, oil, salt, fuel, and cloth, the relevant competent departments should make proper overall plans, broaden sources, and strengthen control. However, for several months, there have been no effective measures to control and regulate materials.</p>
<p>(3) After the issuance of the Gold Yuan, the government has failed to actively guide the flow of funds, and the foreign currency gold and silver collected from the people has not been used properly. Furthermore, the sale of shares in state-owned enterprises, the increase of capital in banks and money houses, and the disposal of enemy and puppet property have not been effectively implemented quickly, causing the Gold Yuan held by the people to become a large amount of floating capital, loosening the money supply, affecting the credit of the currency, and causing panic in the market.</p>
<p>(4) The original plan for emergency economic measures had a fixed deadline for the redemption of gold and silver and the use of legal tender. However, the date for the redemption of gold and silver was suddenly extended. The government used the control of gold and silver as a means to increase the issuance of Gold Yuan. All the rampant black markets for gold and silver foreign currency, the escape and shortage of materials, and the panic buying phenomena occurred before and after the government announced the extension of the gold and silver redemption period. Was this kind of reaction anticipated at the beginning, and was there an effective plan to address this possible problem?</p>
<p>(5) Public employees are well known to live in poverty. If a solution is not found quickly, the administration will never be clean. Currently, the living compensation of public employees is still frozen at the August 19 standard, and daily needs have long been unable to make ends meet. Recently, they are trying to survive in panic buying, struggling in hunger day after day. The impact of this is unimaginable. In summary, it is evident that the government failed to be cautious at the beginning and failed to remedy the situation in time. During the implementation period, either the purpose of the policy was not understood, or the implementation techniques were ignored, resulting in such disastrous consequences for a major policy concerning the national economy and people's livelihood. We express our deep regret for the rampant problems and specially propose this corrective action."</p>
<h3 id="e16">Legislative Yuan Meeting Discusses Prices; Rescue the Economic Crisis Proposal Changed to Questioning Session <a href="#e16" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c16" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">16</a></h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch on the 29th] The fifteenth session of the second term of the Legislative Yuan was held on the 29th, chaired by President Sun. The meeting commenced at 9:30 AM, initially passing twelve reported items. Proposals submitted by the Executive Yuan were distributed to relevant committees for review. Subsequently, several temporary reports were heard, including the Executive Yuan's written response to Yang Gonghui's previous questioning regarding the unreasonable handling of public prices, and the Procedural Committee's proposal to strengthen legislative efficiency. Immediately afterwards, Chen Mingxian put forward a temporary emergency motion, listing ten measures to be resolved and delivered to the government for implementation, to save the current economic crisis and relieve the people's suffering. The listed measures include: (1) Slightly borrowing from wealthy families' assets to fund the suppression of unrest; (2) Levying on major households hoarding supplies for sale at fair prices; (3) Allocating foreign exchange to purchase essential goods and raw materials from abroad; (4) Purchasing supplies from bandit-controlled areas at high prices to prevent the outflow of materials; (5) Controlling daily necessities and strictly implementing rationing; (6) Opening up industrial loans, ensuring the supply of raw materials, and encouraging processing and increased production; (7) Opening up agricultural loans and planning for increased production; (8) Removing price limits on daily necessities, but increasing tax rates to increase national treasury revenue and subsidize rationing expenses; (9) Adjusting the prices of state-owned enterprises, improving management, and reducing waste; (10) Increasing the salaries of public servants and teachers, in addition to in-kind distribution, and making reasonable adjustments based on the price index. After Chen explained the purpose and measures, various committee members spoke in succession, engaging in heated discussions, particularly regarding differing opinions on "price limits" and "negotiated prices," leading to considerable debate. Some committee members also launched fierce attacks on the administrative authorities. However, the majority did not advocate for concrete resolutions, stating that the government's emergency financial measures were all promulgated by the president through orders based on temporary provisions, and the Legislative Yuan should not interfere midway. A final vote passed, following the previous example of similar temporary motions by Wen Shiyuan and others, to submit a question to the Executive Yuan in the name of all members of the Legislative Yuan. At 11:30 AM, the discussion of items began, and the meeting adjourned at 12:00 PM.</p>

<h3 id="e17">Viewing the World from Stalin's Speech <a href="#e17" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c17" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">17</a></h3>
<p>Soviet leader Stalin met with reporters from *Pravda* on the 28th, answering questions and clarifying Soviet policy. A summary of Stalin's remarks includes the following key points: (1) He does not foresee the possibility of a new world war breaking out. (2) He condemned the attempts by Britain and the United States to launch a new world war through their "policy of aggression," but stated that "the instigators of a new war will ultimately fail." (3) He regarded the Anglo-American-French referral of the Berlin issue to the Security Council as an "expression of aggression" by the Western Allies. (4) He also considered the six neutral countries in the Security Council to be supporting the Anglo-American policy of aggression. (5) He revealed that discussions on the Berlin issue in Moscow had twice reached an agreement, but the negotiations failed because Britain and the United States were not sincerely willing to negotiate and cooperate with the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>Stalin rarely meets with reporters and does not easily make statements. It is remembered that to support Wallace's presidential campaign, he met with reporters on May 17, expressing his support for the US-Soviet cooperation plan proposed by Wallace, calling it a "good and hopeful basis" for the US and the Soviet Union to conduct negotiations to resolve differences. Now, more than five months later, the release of this statement has its own important effect, especially in today's global atmosphere of depression and public anxiety, and is particularly worthy of our attention.</p>
<p>The "Cold War" between the United States and the Soviet Union is intensifying, not only making the world's polarization more distinct, but also making the "Cold War" bleed and heat up, and may turn into a real war. The United Nations General Assembly was held in the Palais de Chaillot in Paris, which not only failed to reverse the international reverse current, but also made the "knot" between the East and West poles tighter and tighter. Britain and the United States accuse the Soviet Union's blockade of Berlin of endangering world peace, while the Soviet Union condemns Britain and the United States as "war mongers" and "instigators of a new war." The two sides not only argued endlessly, but also followed up with action. In the past month, we have seen a series of facts on the international stage: on the one hand, five Western European countries have established a joint defense headquarters, and appointed British Chief of the General Staff Marshal Montgomery as the Supreme Commander of the Western European Allied Forces, and will negotiate with the United States and Canada to conclude a seven-nation North Atlantic military alliance treaty. During the British Imperial Conference, all autonomous territories were worried about the insecurity of their defenses, and will also work hard to reorganize their military forces in the future. On the other hand, there is the brewing of the Eastern European alliance, and the Soviet Union is actively strengthening its position within the Iron Curtain: within the Soviet Union, it is concentrating all its efforts to build a huge submarine fleet in case of emergency. In addition, the expansion of the labor unrest in France, the rebellion in South Korea, the turmoil in Southeast Asian countries, the spread of harassment by the Chinese Communists, and everything else, all show the tension of the international situation, and the feeling of being frightened several times a night, with the mountain rain coming and the wind filling the building, therefore, making the survivors of the post-war era not panic about whether today's world has reached the edge of the outbreak of war again?</p>
<p>Judging by common sense, the bloodstains of the Second World War have not yet dried, and all those who have a little rationality and conscience, whether they are the people of the Soviet Union and the countries within its Iron Curtain, or the people of Britain, the United States and other democratic countries, after deep reflection, as long as they do not forget the painful lessons of the Second World War, no one will welcome an international war. Although there is a call for "preventing war" in the United States today, and public opinion is unanimously opposed to the government's adoption of a "policy of appeasement" towards the Soviet Union, it is by no means intended to immediately open the bloody curtain of the Third World War. On the Soviet side, although it is spreading the seeds of turmoil around the world, creating unrest throughout the world, but in terms of its own interests, the Soviet Union is determined not to want to start a war lightly at this time before it has created the atomic bomb. Now, from Stalin's speech, we can also see that Stalin at this time still does not dare to reach the back of human rationality and conscience, and openly announce that the Soviet Union does not resign from a war. Therefore, humanity's love of peace, rationality and conscience are the only powerful guarantees for world peace today.</p>
<p>However, although the Third World War has not yet reached the edge of its outbreak today, if all parties are on edge and have been on edge for a long time, it may also turn fake into reality. Fortunately, humanity's love of peace, rationality and conscience can still prompt anyone not to start a war lightly at this time. Looking at the world from Stalin's speech, we believe that although today's world is in the midst of thousands of disasters, it is too early to say that the Third World War will break out soon.</p>

<p>[Our Taipei Dispatch on the 29th] Taiwan National Assembly delegates held a temporary economic symposium, quickly deciding to recommend that the central government consider the value of the Taiwan dollar and allow it to have direct exchange relations with foreign currencies, without converting through the gold yuan. At the same time, they sent a letter requesting the provincial government to abolish food price limits and the food zone system, and expand rationing, etc. In recent days, the atmosphere for adjusting the Taiwan exchange rate has been very strong, and general prices have plummeted. Rice has fallen from 1,200 yuan per catty to 500 yuan, but vegetable prices remain high, but there is no longer a phenomenon of not being able to buy with money.</p>

<p>Wang Lingji's Admonishment to Commissioners and County Magistrates</p>
<p>[Our Chongqing Dispatch on the 29th] Wang Lingji's admonishment to the commissioners and county magistrates on the 28th: (1) The central government limited Sichuan's grain to 500,000 large bales to be cleared by November and December. Currently, the grain from the counties along the river is being allocated first, and it has been found that two major counties have hoarded grain and failed to pay. The county magistrate will be dismissed and held accountable. (2) The household registration in Sichuan's 144 counties is poor. Most household registration books have not been completed, and those that have been completed are mostly falsified. County magistrates cite a lack of funds as an excuse and have never handled identity cards. It is hoped that they will not procrastinate again. (3) The anti-bandit training class in Sichuan has ended. Each county will set up a Communist liquidation committee. Each county has designated six people as a protection team to thoroughly eliminate latent bandits.</p>
<p>[Another Dispatch] Zhu Shaoliang attended the winter defense meeting of the garrison headquarters today and said: The Communist bandits' armed forces in Sichuan Province have not been established. According to the experience of suppressing bandits in Huaying Mountain, local authorities have concealed or exaggerated bandit situations. It is hoped that they will be corrected, and it is hoped that the county militia teams will communicate information with each other and jointly suppress the bandits.</p>

<h3 id="e28">Supplementary Measures for Land Prices and Land Tax Collection Announced and Implemented by the Executive Yuan <a href="#e28" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c28" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">28</a></h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch on the 29th] After the currency reform, the Executive Yuan stipulated supplementary measures for land prices and land tax collection, which were announced and implemented. Among them, it is stipulated that land prices calculated in legal currency should be converted into gold yuan, but if the original price is too low, and the conversion results in a price lower than the pre-war land price or the actual land price, adjustments and corrections should be made with reference. In areas where land registration is being organized or land prices are being re-evaluated, adjustments and conversions should be made in accordance with these regulations, and then announced. Land value tax, land registration fees, and compensation for land prices, as well as land rents and land prices for leased and distributed land, collected according to the legal currency land price, should be handled in accordance with these regulations. Those already collected are exempt from conversion. The calculation of supplementary land value-added tax is based on: (1) Before the currency reform, land transfers calculated in legal currency should be converted into gold yuan. (2) After the currency reform, if the original land price for land transfers is calculated in legal currency, it should be adjusted according to the price index and converted into gold yuan before calculating according to law. The price index compilation is based on (August 19), but after adjusting according to the price index, the original land price converted into gold yuan should not exceed the gold yuan statutory land price adjusted according to this method.</p>

<h3 id="e40">Stalin's Statement on the Berlin Problem: The U.S. Rebukes It as Inconsistent with Actions, Believing It Intends to Evade Responsibility for the Crisis <a href="#e40" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c40" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">40</a></h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 29th] The U.S. government responded coldly to Stalin's statement on the Berlin dispute. The State Department issued a brief statement saying that the points indicated by the Soviet Union had already been proven inaccurate by the White Paper issued by the Western powers on September 26 after the failure of the four-power negotiations on the Berlin issue in Moscow. State Department press officer McDermott said, "We will not comment on it; the White Paper is a complete and accurate record of everything that happened."</p>
<p>[United Press, London, 29th] A British Foreign Office spokesman criticized Stalin's statement today while receiving reporters, saying that the British government was "very surprised" by Stalin's attacks on the six neutral countries in the Security Council, who were trying to facilitate a compromise on the Berlin crisis.</p>
<p>[U.S. Information Service, Paris, 29th] A Chinese spokesman said, "The six neutral countries have done their best to ease political tensions." He declared, "If Stalin calls this an act of war, then so be it."</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 28th] People here believe that Stalin's statement may have been issued for several purposes: (1) To attempt to shift the blame for the current crisis and the failure to reach a compromise onto the Western powers. (2) To spread war panic and create chaos by declaring that the division between East and West is almost impossible to resolve. (3) To confuse world public opinion by blaming the Western powers. (4) It may be to give last-minute support to Wallace's campaign.</p>
<p>[United Press, Paris, 29th] The Western delegation to the United Nations stated on the 29th that they were concerned that Stalin's condemnation of the West was a sign of the Soviet Union intensifying the Cold War between East and West. Not only would the Soviet representative to the United Nations strengthen his accusations against the West during the debate on the Berlin issue, but the Cold War would also be launched worldwide. Stalin's statement alarmed many representatives, leading them to abandon their small hope of resolving the Berlin crisis early. Stalin's claims about the West's aggressive policies and the Western leaders' plans to start a new war were nothing new. Molotov had frequently made such statements in international conferences over the past three years. However, the Western delegation considered it important that Stalin personally attacked the Western powers, which was the first time this had happened. In the past, when the situation was deadlocked, Western representatives had repeatedly called on Stalin to extend a conciliatory hand. When the United Nations delegation met on the 29th, they all inquired about the meaning of Stalin's statement. Did it indicate a major change in Soviet policy? Or did Stalin abandon hope of compromise with the West? Or was Stalin impatient with world public opinion's opposition to the Soviet Union? Or had the actions of the United Nations produced considerable results? No delegation could answer these questions.</p>
<h3 id="e41">Security Council Postpones Vote on Sanctions Against Israel, Reportedly Due to Truman's Intervention <a href="#e41" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c41" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">41</a></h3>
<p>[Our Report] Paris, 29th Broadcast: According to diplomatic sources, President Truman's last-minute intervention prevented the United Nations from taking action on the proposal to sanction Israel. The Security Council postponed the vote on the joint British-Chinese proposal to next Tuesday (November 2nd). The U.S. delegation neither confirmed nor denied the news that this postponement of the vote was brought about by Truman's intervention.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 29th] After the Israeli government formally requested direct negotiations with the Egyptian government, the Security Council unanimously adopted a Canadian proposal this morning to form a special committee to prepare revisions to the original text of the Security Council's resolution on Palestine. The members of this committee include representatives from China, Britain, Belgium, France, and Ukraine, and will be assisted by Acting Mediator Bunche.</p>
<p>The Canadian proposal was passed after the Canadian representative, McNaughton, pointed out that all efforts should be made to transform the Palestinian truce into a real peace. The passage of this proposal completely overturned the joint British-Chinese proposal of the 28th, which called for the imposition of economic and other sanctions under the Charter against the offending party. Before the Canadian proposal was passed, Israeli representative Eban again vehemently attacked the joint British-Chinese proposal, saying that it would only exacerbate the Nikif crisis, and he emphasized that the only task currently before the Security Council was to order both sides to begin negotiations for a real peace. The Security Council will continue to examine the Palestinian issue on November 2nd.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 28th] The Israeli government suddenly announced today its willingness to begin negotiations with the Egyptian government, either directly or through the mediation of the United Nations mediator, to clarify the various differences between the two governments. However, sources close to the Egyptian delegation claim that Egypt will still insist on its determined position not to negotiate directly with the Israeli government, because Egypt has not yet recognized the existence of the Israeli government.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Tel Aviv, 28th] Israeli Prime Minister Gurion told Parliament today that the Israeli army will never retreat to the positions it held before the start of the Nikif battle on October 14.</p>
<h3 id="e42">The Political Committee Decides to Continue Studying the Greek Issue <a href="#e42" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c42" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">42</a></h3>
<p>The Soviet Union Demands the Withdrawal of Foreign Troops Stationed in Greece</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 29th] The United Nations Political Committee met today and passed a motion to continue studying the Greek issue until it has been fully debated by a vote of 34 to 11 (with 5 abstentions, including the Soviet Union). Therefore, the issues to be studied by the Political Committee today include the following: (1) The Greek issue; (2) The disarmament issue; (3) The Palestinian issue. The Disarmament Subcommittee presented a draft to the representatives today, and the eight-day deadline for studying the Palestinian issue will end tomorrow.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Paris, 28th] The Soviet Union today demanded the withdrawal of all foreign troops stationed in Greece and the dissolution of the United Nations Special Committee on the Balkans. Vyshinsky reiterated the Soviet Union's position of a year ago in the United Nations Political Committee, accusing Britain and the United States of interfering in Greece. He considered the work of the Special Committee to be a pile of rubbish, and he flatly rejected the joint British-Chinese-French-American proposal to extend the Special Committee for another year.</p>
<h3 id="e43">Soviet Ambassador Asks the United States to Publicize the Contents of the Military Conference in Japan. The U.S. State Department Replies That It Was Only a Routine Matter. <a href="#e43" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c43" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">43</a></h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 28th, United Press] The United States has summarily rejected the Soviet Union's request to obtain information about the secret meeting of U.S. military leaders in Japan on October 12. The reason given by the United States is that this is not a matter for the Soviet Union. The U.S. State Department's reply came only hours after the Soviet Ambassador to the United States, Panyushkin, made the above request to the Allied Far Eastern Commission. The State Department replied that MacArthur, as the U.S. Supreme Commander in the Pacific, could often hold military conferences with senior officers, which was only a routine matter related to the U.S. government. The State Department also said that Ambassador Panyushkin's statement regarding the Yokosuka base was completely unfounded. This base has always been used by the U.S. Navy to support the Allied Supreme Commander in implementing occupation goals. Therefore, the implication that the Far Eastern decision on basic policies toward Japan after Japan's surrender had been grossly violated was groundless. The Tokyo meeting mentioned by Panyushkin was purely a routine military conference and was different from the purposes reported in various news outlets.</p>

<p>[United Press, London, 28th] Churchill said in the House of Commons on the 28th that any matter of self-defense in Western Europe must rely on the assistance of the United States. He said that, given the crisis of war that had been uttered at the lips of all diplomats, the only way to prevent Europe from being invaded and enslaved by communist labor under the guidance of the Kremlin was the atomic bomb. He said, "The military preparations being carried out in Western Europe can never be better than the armies that have accepted foreign aid to build over the past many years, and are far from the power of the atomic bomb to prevent war. Therefore, we will rely on the full support of the great republic across the Atlantic for the military deployments that are being carried out." He said that unnecessary obstacles should not be placed on the path of "rebuilding Germany," and he called for a stop to anti-Nazi trials.</p>
<h3 id="e52">Stalin Talks About the Berlin Problem, Condemns British and American Aggressive Policies, Declares the Failure of Agreements Is Not the Fault of the Soviet Union <a href="#e52" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c52" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">52</a></h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Moscow, 28th] Stalin broke his long silence and published a response to reporters' inquiries in Pravda today, condemning the Western countries' aggressive intentions toward the Soviet Union and their deliberate sabotage of the conclusion of agreements. Most of the questions and answers concerned the Berlin issue and U.S. policy. Stalin's answers were as follows:</p>
<p>(1) The Security Council's discussion of the Berlin issue, as well as the attitude of the British and American delegations, clearly showed the aggressiveness of British and American policies. (2) Regarding the simultaneous lifting of traffic restrictions and the unification of Berlin's currency system, the three Western powers and the Soviet Union had actually reached an agreement in Moscow on August 30. This agreement did not harm the prestige of anyone, but respected the interests of both sides and guaranteed further cooperation. However, the British and American governments denied the work of their special envoys in Moscow, considered the agreement invalid, and submitted the Berlin issue to the Security Council. (3) Before the Security Council voted on the Berlin issue, an agreement to resolve the Berlin issue was also reached during informal meetings in Paris. After the President of the Security Council, Brahmagreia, met with Vyshinsky, there was indeed a draft resolution that could allow both sides to consult with each other. However, the British and American representatives again denied this agreement. Therefore, British and American policies clearly did not want an agreement, nor did they want cooperation, but only wanted empty talk to cover up their aggressive policies, and to shift the responsibility for the failure of the agreement onto the Soviet Union, and falsely accuse cooperation with the Soviet Union as being impossible. War instigators are afraid of truly concluding agreements with the Soviet Union, because this will shake their position of instigating war. The Western countries submitted the Berlin issue to the Security Council, believing that they could control the Security Council and do whatever they wanted. Stalin emphasized that the current policies of Britain and the United States "are policies of aggression and instigation of war," and that the six neutral countries, including China, Canada, Belgium, Ecuador, and Colombia, supported "policies of aggression in preparation for war." Stalin replied when answering the sixth and final question, "Everything can only lead the instigators of war to a shameful defeat. The main leader of war instigation, Churchill, has lost the trust of his people and of democrats around the world. Other war instigators cannot escape the same fate as Churchill. The people of the world have fresh memories of the horrors of war, and the public opinion that craves peace is strong and powerful, and will never allow Churchill and others to launch another new war that is beneficial to themselves."</p>

<p>Public and Private Organizations' Rice Purchases Limited to One *Dou* per Person per Month</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] The Shanghai Social Affairs Bureau previously issued purchase certificates to facilitate public and private institutions' purchase of rice from rice-producing areas, for inspection by relevant authorities along the way. The calculation of purchase limits for rice procurement in producing areas was originally based on three *dou* per person per month, with one *dou* allocated, and an additional two *dou* allowed to be purchased, up to a maximum of two months' supply. The Social Affairs Bureau received a telegram from the Ministry of Food yesterday, instructing that it should be changed to two *dou* per person per month, with one *dou* allocated, and one *dou* allowed to be self-procured, still adhering to the maximum limit of two months' supply based on the actual number of employees currently employed by each institution. The Social Affairs Bureau has decided to implement this calculation method starting today.</p>
<p>Furthermore, some of the purchase certificates issued by the Social Affairs Bureau have reached their expiration dates. A public notice urging their return was issued yesterday. If certificate holders delay in returning them, in addition to strict reminders based on the stubs, no further certificates will be issued for rice procurement in the future.</p>
<p>Distribution of Rice for Public Servants and Teachers in October to Begin on November 1st</p>
<p>The distribution of rice rations for public servants and teachers in Shanghai for October is scheduled to begin on November 1st, distributed by the original rice shops, and will end on November 20th.</p>
<p>Today is the Last Day for Exchanging Gold and Foreign Currency</p>
<p>Those Found Concealing Them Thereafter Will Be Severely Punished</p>
<p>The deadline for the exchange of gold and foreign currency, as announced by the Ministry of Finance, was extended to the end of this month. The 31st of tomorrow falls on a Sunday holiday, so today is the last day for the exchange. Authorities have stated that there will be no further extensions after this deadline. After thorough preparations by the inspection authorities in recent days, a large-scale operation to hunt down gold and banknotes will be launched after the exchange deadline. Actions will begin next week. Mr. Chiang Ching-kuo has paid close attention to this matter after returning to Shanghai. Yesterday, he separately summoned relevant parties to give instructions. At that time, all relevant units will cooperate in the operation, paying particular attention to wealthy and prominent households. Anyone found privately hoarding and not exchanging will be subject to severe punishment in addition to the confiscation of gold and banknotes.</p>
<p>[Another Report] The government has set a deadline for the exchange of gold, silver, and foreign currency for Gold Yuan Certificates. However, people are concerned about how to handle gold, silver, and foreign currency left in their care by relatives and friends who have left town, or deposited with the court due to lawsuits, which may not have been exchanged on time. The Ministry of Finance's emergency financial and economic measures decree does not yet specify this. Lawyer Xiao Zhenkai previously submitted a telegram to the authorities for clarification based on inquiries from his clients. Now, the Ministry of Finance has issued the following interpretation of the handling method: (1) Gold, silver, and foreign currency deposited with the court due to cases should be immediately applied for by the court to be transferred to the Central Bank for conversion into Gold Yuan Certificates, pending further handling. (2) Regarding gold, silver, and foreign currency held in custody for others, the custodian should immediately notify the depositor to retrieve it. If it has not been retrieved before the expiration of the exchange deadline, the custodian may convert it on their behalf in accordance with the provisions of the Civil Code regarding management without mandate.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] Since the issuance of Gold Yuan Certificates, all legal tender, customs gold unit notes, and Northeast circulating notes, regardless of denomination, have been required by the Ministry of Finance to be exchanged for Gold Yuan Certificates by the National Bank before November 20th. In addition to the National Bank and its branches actively handling this exchange, it has also entrusted the Bank of China, Bank of Communications, Agricultural Bank of China, Postal Remittances Bureau of China, China Trust Company, Central Cooperative Treasury, provincial banks, and the Yunnan Provincial Cooperative Treasury to conduct the exchange. For border areas and remote counties, the Postal Remittances Bureau will instruct post offices or post office agencies to handle the exchange. With the deadline approaching, the National Bank has notified its branches and other exchange agencies to actively conduct the exchange in order to complete it on time.</p>
<p>One-Cent Copper Coins Swept Away in a Rush</p>
<p>National Bank Temporarily Suspends Exchange</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] Since the Central Bank began exchanging one-cent copper coins, citizens have queued up to exchange them in unprecedented crowds. However, the mint only produces 300,000 coins per day, and the original supply of over 3 million coins to the National Bank has been swept away by the crowds seeking to exchange them. Therefore, the bank suspended the exchange yesterday. It will resume when more coins arrive. Regarding rumors of people collecting copper coins at high prices, the Issuance Bureau of the National Bank has reported its findings to the Ministry of Finance for handling. Furthermore, Wei Zengfu, the director of the Central Mint, also went to Beijing a few days ago, reportedly to seek instructions from the authorities regarding the mint's supply situation.</p>

The watches were entrusted to him by He Shenchang of Youwei Watch Store in Hankou. He was supposed to deliver 44 of them to Wang Qixiang and Wang Shunqing at No. 60 Jiangxi Road, Guangdong Road, and the remaining 190 watches to Chen Shude of Maodeli Watch Store. His remuneration was 1.5 yuan per watch.</p>

It is reported that the replication industry has agreed to calculate the exchange ratio based on production costs, roughly 28.5 *pi* of fine cloth weighing 12 pounds for one bundle of 20-count yarn. Wang Qiyu of the cotton spinning industry proposed the slogan of "mutual assistance and cooperation" regarding the exchange ratio, hoping that the exchange ratio would take into account the difficulties of both parties. It is reported that the case will not see progress until the authorities announce a new economic supplementary plan.</p>

It is understood that this suggestion has been adopted by the Executive Yuan and approved for record. The registration of people's foreign exchange assets will end at the end of December this year.

<p>Yantai Refugee Students Moving to Jiangwan Still Pending</p>
<p>Red Swastika Society Responsible for Meals, Zou Jian Calls for Donations of Winter Clothing</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] Refugee students, faculty, and their families who evacuated from Yantai to Shanghai and are residing in the Shandong Fellow Association were originally scheduled to move to Jiangwan tomorrow. Yesterday afternoon, representatives from the Youth Counseling Committee of the Ministry of Education and the Shandong Provincial Education Department met at the Municipal Education Bureau to discuss handling methods. Due to insufficient preparation of cooking utensils and other items, it was decided to postpone the move for another four or five days.</p>
<p>The refugee students originally received one meal of plain porridge a day from the Municipal Relief Committee, which was not enough to satisfy their hunger. Starting yesterday, the Red Swastika Society took over responsibility for meals, providing two meals of porridge a day at 8:00 AM and 3:00 PM. The students are divided into groups of 200 and take turns going to the association on Changle Road to eat, in good order. The students' mood is also better than before. The night before last, an anonymous person personally went to the Shandong Fellow Association and donated one yuan to each student, faculty member, and family member, totaling 2,280 yuan. As of yesterday, donations from all walks of life had reached more than 5,000 yuan. Zou Jian, the speaker of the Yantai Senate, who led the evacuation to Shanghai, broadcast the situation of the Yantai evacuation at the Xin Yun Radio Station at 5:00 PM yesterday afternoon, expressing his heartfelt gratitude for the warm sympathy shown by the heads of various Shanghai institutions and the elders.

<p>The Tight Credit Situation Is Worsening, the Underground Interbank Lending Market Is Active</p>
<p>Yesterday, "the underground interbank lending market was active, and credit was extremely tight due to a large amount of floating capital flowing to the southwest and Guangzhou." Yesterday, some small and medium-sized banks and financial institutions felt the pressure of tight credit. There were many shortages of funds, with more institutions seeking loans than lending them. Underground interest rates were high, with daily loans of 1,000 yuan at a minimum of 8.5 yuan, and a maximum of 10 yuan, equivalent to over 30% monthly interest. Over-the-counter prices in various industries were very active. Most of those lending funds did so for one or two days.</p>
<p>Another Report: The increasingly tight credit situation in recent days, according to financial figures, is mainly due to the outflow of capital to the south, but also to merchants rushing to replenish their commodity inventories. If merchants truly sell all their goods and do not replenish their inventories, they will inevitably deposit the proceeds into banks, and the credit situation will ease. However, the opposite is true: many banks and financial institutions have more overdrafts.</p>
<p>Another Report: Recently, the panic over cash in this city has become more severe, and immediate checks are prohibited. Bank and financial institution clients must find other ways to balance their accounts on the same day. Therefore, the use of transfer applications has greatly increased in recent days. Ordinary banks and financial institutions use 50 to 60 copies per day, and in some cases, over 100 copies. These transfer applications involve transferring funds from the bank's exchange account with the Central Bank, so they are not included in the check clearing figures.</p>
<p>The Cash Shortage Continues, with Premiums on the Market, Especially for 50 and 100 Yuan Notes</p>
<p>It is said that the Central Bank issues a certain amount of large notes every day, but they have not yet been found on the market. It is widely believed that they have been swept away by cash transporters. It is also said that the premium has reached over 5 yuan per 1,000.</p>
<p>Raw Materials Are Extremely Scarce, China Textile Corporation Reduces Production, Cotton Was Not Available on the Market Yesterday</p>
<p>Due to the shortage of raw materials, the output of cotton yarn at the China Textile Corporation's factories is declining. The current output is mainly used to repay the US Aid Association's yarn debts and there is little capacity to supply the market. Most of the factories currently operating are producing for the Central Bank's sales. Yesterday, a total of four types were offered, totaling 156 pieces, worth 107,523 Gold Yuan. The appraised prices were 255 yuan for 6-count Deputy Sunlight, 480 yuan for 10-count Deputy Blue Phoenix, 568 yuan for 14-count Water Moon, and 700 yuan for 20-count Tianguan.</p>
<p>Cotton Cloth Businesses Shorten Operating Hours</p>
<p>Cotton cloth retail stores have become targets of panic buying in recent days. From morning to night, customers are constantly at the door, causing staff to be tense and exhausted. Some have even fallen ill. Yesterday, members of the association sent a letter to the association, explaining the situation and requesting the association to find a way to improve the operating hours of the retail stores. The association believes that this situation will have a great impact on cotton cloth merchants. If no remedy is found, they will all face closure. The association's board of directors recently resolved to shorten daily operating hours by one hour, changing them from 9:00 AM to 5:00 PM, with one day off on Sundays. The association has notified all members to comply.</p>
<p>No Cotton Transactions</p>
<p>There were still no cotton transactions yesterday. Cotton merchants in this city are still watching the trend. New cotton has been on the market for a long time, but most cotton merchants are still not planning to purchase it immediately, and the market remains quiet.</p>
<p>Cement Industry Suggests Adopting Soft Chain Method to Improve Quality</p>
<p>China's cement standards have been tested in the United Kingdom, Germany, Japan, and France before the war. Not only are they not inferior to any foreign goods, but their performance even surpasses that of British and American products. After the war, the Ministry of Industry and Commerce's Central Standards Bureau, in order to improve the quality of domestic cement and meet the sales needs at home and abroad, has drafted standards and sent them to the National Cement Industry Association for comments. Cement experts Wang Tao, Xu Zongdong, and Lu Zongxian provided suggestions that, in order to make China's cement comparable to cement from any country in the world, the soft chain method should be used for testing, and fixed and fineness standards should be set, as well as raising the standards for fineness and tensile strength. The impact of sand on cement strength is very significant and should also be clearly stipulated. It is understood that the Ministry of Industry and Commerce has adopted the above-mentioned suggestions and included them in the original plan for discussion and approval, which will be implemented soon.</p>
<p>Woolen Fabric Inventory Registration Completed, Allocation Methods Still Awaiting Approval</p>
<p>The Four Districts Woolen Textile Industry Association, after receiving an order from the Economic Supervision Office to participate in the joint allocation of woolen fabric in this city, has completed the survey and registration of the inventory of woolen fabric factories throughout the city by the industry association. It will soon be allocated to the Shanghai Woolen Fabric Business Association, which will then be re-allocated to woolen fabric stores in this city. It is understood that the registered inventory of woolen fabric is much less than expected. How this batch of woolen fabric will be sold to citizens or public servants and teachers in this city is still awaiting instructions from the Social Affairs Bureau.</p>
<p>100,000 *Dan* of Rice from Wuxi Starts Transporting to Shanghai</p>
<p>In order to enrich the city's food supply, the supervisor purchased 100,000 *dan* of rice from Wuxi and other producing areas a decade ago. All of this rice has been purchased and has begun to be transported to Shanghai, which can be transported within three days. After this rice arrives in Shanghai, most of it will be used for allocation, and part of it will be sold in stores.</p>
<p>Another Report: Recently, rice merchants in the producing areas of Wuxi, Dangshu, Pinghu, Zhoupu, Jiaxing, and Wuhu have had a lot of difficulties from local governments when handling purchase certificates from the Shanghai District Supervision Office to purchase rice. Already purchased rice, amounting to about 20,000 *shi*, is also not allowed to leave the area. Rice merchants yesterday sent several representatives to the Supervisor's Office to report on the situation and requested the office to send personnel to the above-mentioned producing areas together with the rice merchants to order immediate release.</p>
<p>The Rice Market Is Still Not Open</p>
<p>Rice arrivals are still not flourishing. The Nanshi market has 605 *shi* and the Beishi market has 514 *shi*. The two markets total 1,149 *shi*. Although there are price quotes in the market, there are no transactions. The number of people in the market is decreasing day by day. The queues at rice shops are growing longer, with each person buying five *sheng* upon presentation of their identity card.</p>
<p>Miscellaneous Grains Not Open, Yellow Beans Resumed Allocation Yesterday</p>
<p>The Hubei guild allocated 151 bags of Poyangzi yellow beans, priced at 13.3 yuan without a bag. Among them, 51 bags were allocated to the National Defense Medical College, and 100 bags were allocated to the tofu industry.</p>
<p>Sugar Supply and Demand Stagnates</p>
<p>There were still no transactions in the sugar market yesterday. License holders are watching the future situation quietly. The supply and demand sides in the market are stagnating, with no buying or selling. The association's allocation is still difficult, and the market is still cold. Local replication grain merchants, with no source of supply, are seeing a daily decrease in the supply of snacks and cakes in stores. The queues at Nanhuo stores are increasing daily, and business is still too busy to handle.</p>
<p>Banks and Financial Institutions May Be Allowed to Use Cash Deposits for Legitimate Purposes</p>
<p>The Central Bank recently received a telegram from the Ministry of Finance, stating that commercial banks, after depositing the cash portion of their adjusted assets with the bank in accordance with regulations, may apply to use them in accordance with the "Measures for Using Deposited Capital Funds After Commercial Banks Adjust Their Capital" if they have legitimate purposes before the bank sends personnel to inspect them.</p>
<p>The Tea Market Is Still Active</p>
<p>Yesterday, from morning to closing, the buying interest in red and green tea varieties was still strong. However, due to the scarcity of goods in the producing areas and the high prices, the supply is becoming increasingly uncertain, and transactions are lacking in reality. According to authoritative figures in China's tea export industry, since the sellers have been reluctant to sell cheaply, domestic tea prices have recently been close to foreign tea prices. However, if China's tea continues to prosper in the future, it will be in an upside-down state. Looking at this situation, exports may not be optimistic.</p>
<p>Cigarette Market Suspends Trading</p>
<p>The cigarette market was informed by the Shanghai District Economic Supervision Office that the cigarette market affiliated to the industry association had no goods for exchange and was ordered to temporarily suspend operations. Therefore, the market has entered a state of stillness. Although some traders came to the market yesterday morning, they soon dispersed. The daily necessities soap and candle market affiliated to the industry has also been suspended.</p>
<p>Another Report: The authorities' regulation that members of the cigarette industry association who joined after "August 19" will no longer be eligible for allocation has caused dissatisfaction among the industry. Yesterday morning, representatives of the industry asked the association for the right to be allocated goods.</p>

<p>Student Enrollment Dispute at National Taiwan University, President Zhuang Resigns by Telegram</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report from Taipei on the 29th] National Taiwan University was ordered to continue enrolling transfer students, and today is the examination date. When candidates entered the examination hall, they were suddenly dissuaded from taking the exam by students, causing the examination to be unable to be held. The Student Union of National Taiwan University invited reporters and stated that there were no vacancies in any of the colleges this semester, so there was no reason to continue enrolling transfer students. The school authorities were under external pressure and had no choice but to do so. The students are determined to oppose it to the end. President Zhuang Changgong has telegraphed the Ministry of Education to report and request his resignation again. The Student Union unanimously urged Zhuang to retain his position.</p>

<h3 id="e54">Attempt to Disrupt Finances Has International Background; Police Squad Successfully Cracks Two Cases; Shen Wenjie, One of the "Four Heavenly Kings," Arrested Again on Another Charge <a href="#e54" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c54" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">54</a></h3>
<p>[Our Report] Since its establishment, the Police Bureau's Economic Police Brigade's Gold and Currency Investigation Team successfully cracked three major black market gold and currency cases in rapid succession within sixteen hours, from 8:00 AM on the 27th to 12:00 PM on the 28th of this month. Among these, two cases involved attempts to undermine the credibility of the Gold Yuan currency by exploiting international connections, with the aim of creating a black market for gold and currency, thereby causing runaway inflation and plunging people's lives into despair. The other case involved Shen Wenjie, one of the "Four Heavenly Kings" of the black market gold and currency trade, who had previously been arrested and released on bail by the District Prosecutor's Office. Although no transaction was taking place at the scene, he was arrested due to significant suspicion. After thorough interrogation by the team, all three cases have been concluded and will be transferred to the Special Criminal Court for legal action. The details of the successful investigations are as follows: (1) A British expatriate (currently at large) was recently entrusted by a foreign bank to purchase a large quantity of US dollars at high black market prices. The expatriate then entrusted Wang Chengzhi, the manager of the American Pacific Enterprise Company at 9 Zhongshan East Road, third floor, in this city, to handle the matter. After Wang searched everywhere, he became acquainted with an American expatriate. The Economic Police Brigade became aware of this American expatriate and dispatched personnel to contact him. On the 27th of this month, the American expatriate pretended to call Wang, claiming to have US$3,500 willing to sell at a price of seven Gold Yuan to one US dollar, and scheduled a transaction for 8:00 PM that evening. Wang, unaware of the ruse, was quite pleased. At the appointed time, the team first dispatched team leader Wang Enzu, deputy team leader Chen Jingxing, Tao Genrong, and Chinese and foreign officers to the vicinity of Wang Chengzhi's office on the Bund to make arrangements. At the same time, squad leader Fan Mingxin was dispatched to accompany the American expatriate, carrying the US dollars, to arrive on time. Unexpectedly, Wang was also exceptionally vigilant, saying that the Gold Yuan currency was not in the office and asked the American expatriate to accompany him to his home. He then immediately called a taxi and drove them to 16, Lane 506, Jianguo West Road. At this time, the pre-arranged police officers saw that the plan was not proceeding as expected, so they also followed in a car. After arriving at Wang's residence, Wang went upstairs and brought down 25,000 Gold Yuan. After both parties counted the money, Wang suddenly said that it was very inconvenient to store the US dollars at home, and put the US dollars in the lining of his coat. He then hired a car to take them to his relative's house on Xiangyang Road. Upon arriving at Xiangyang Road, squad leader Fan showed his identification, and the accompanying personnel also stepped forward to take Wang and the American expatriate into custody. After being arrested, Wang, knowing that there was no way to deny it, confessed directly. Yesterday, based on his confession, the team also arrested a fellow accomplice, Yang Shounian, in a hospital. The British expatriate who is at large is still being pursued. Wang is a graduate of Harvard University and West Point Military Academy in the United States and was sent by the American Pacific Enterprise headquarters to Shanghai several months ago to take up the position of manager of the branch office.</p>
<p>Soviet Expatriate Entrusted to Purchase US Dollars at High Prices</p>
<p>(2) A Soviet citizen, Li Wenzhuofu (B. Liventzoff), residing at 5 Cangzhou Villa, Jing'an Temple Road, was recently entrusted by a certain party to purchase US dollars at high black market prices in the same manner, attempting to disrupt the financial system. The Economic Police Brigade became aware of this and, using a strategy to their advantage, secretly dispatched foreign officers to negotiate, agreeing to a price of nine and a half Gold Yuan per US dollar for US$4,600. Li believed it to be true and carried a suitcase containing over 43,700 Gold Yuan and accompanied them in a car to an apartment near Hengshan Road and Gaoen Road, which had been pre-arranged by the police. At that time, the foreign police officer went upstairs to retrieve the US$4,600 and returned to the car. Just as the transaction was taking place, the pre-arranged police officers rushed out and arrested Li. Knowing that the matter had been exposed, Li still tried to resist and attempted to snatch back the cash that was about to be paid, but was stopped by the police. After being taken to the bureau for interrogation, he also confessed directly, but refused to reveal the names of his principals. Yesterday, the police went to his residence for a search but found nothing. It was found that the place was the private residence of his brother-in-law (a Dutchman). According to the people in the house, they never inquired about his whereabouts, but recently they often saw him carrying large amounts of Gold Yuan in and out.</p>
<p>Mishandeling &amp; Co. Third Floor Has a Secret Room</p>
<p>(3) Shen Wenjie, the former manager of Mishandeling Cloth Company at 58 Tianjin Road, second floor, was found by the Economic Police Brigade on June 14th of this year to be engaged in black market gold and currency trading, and three ten-tael gold bars, over one hundred million yuan in cash, and draft account receipts were confiscated. After being sent to the District Prosecutor's Office, he was soon released on bail. Recently, Shen resumed his illegal activity and continued to secretly engage in black market gold and currency trading. After receiving a report, the Economic Police Brigade dispatched team leader Wang Enzu and officers to search the premises on the morning of the 28th. Although no trading activity was found at the scene, in his secret room on the third floor and inside the hidden compartments of the floor, walls, and seats, they found checks from Yifeng Qianzhuang and account books with transaction figures of over ten thousand Gold Yuan. In addition to photographing all the evidence, Shen and related suspects Ye Xinghua, Zhang Yinzhi, Cheng Yingchu, and other four people were taken to the bureau for detention and interrogation.</p>

<p>[Our Report] Chiang Ching-kuo returned to Shanghai from Nanjing yesterday morning, maintaining complete silence on future economic control policies. It is rumored that he will issue an important proclamation next Monday, stating his position. After returning to Shanghai, Chiang spent the entire day busy handling official business. In the afternoon at 5:00 PM, Wang Zhennan, the president of the Shanghai Special Criminal Court, visited him for half an hour. Chiang then immediately summoned Wang Zishuang, the deputy director of the Business Bureau of the Central Bank, to study the technical issues of opening up industrial loans in order to solve the difficulties in industrial production in this city. Director Wu visited him at 6:15 PM and left around 7:00 PM.</p>
<h3 id="e56">Difficulty in Procuring Pork; Increase in Fresh Fish Supply <a href="#e56" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c56" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">56</a></h3>
<p>[Our Report] In order to strengthen the management of small vegetable markets, the economic control authorities previously instructed the police bureau to establish a special agency to manage the supply and prices of fresh meat, vegetables, and fish. Recently, after consultation among the responsible personnel, it was decided that the prices of fresh meat and vegetables will be maintained at the "August 19th" market price before the implementation of negotiated pricing. To increase supply, each pork merchant has been instructed to purchase fresh pork from northern Jiangsu. However, because the price of pork in the producing areas is higher than in Shanghai, the authorities, taking the facts into consideration, have also reached an agreement with the Fisheries Management Office that fish will be substituted for meat when necessary, and starting from today, the office will increase the supply of fresh fish to the fish markets by 50,000 catties per day to meet the needs of the market.</p>
<h3 id="e57">Shipments of Fresh Fish to Shanghai Intercepted; Social Affairs Bureau Requests Permission for Passage <a href="#e57" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c57" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">57</a></h3>
<p>[Our Report] The Municipal Fishery Association, the Fish Business Association, the Fresh Fish Business Association, the Fishing Vessel Association, the Seafood Transportation and Marketing Federation, the Fishmongers' Association, and other organizations jointly submitted a document to the Social Affairs Bureau yesterday, stating that the supply of fresh fish in this city relies on the outer sea and the inland rivers of Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces. Recently, due to the fact that the local governments do not understand the actual supply and demand situation, they arbitrarily intercept fish and seafood passing through their territories, especially in Hangzhou, Jiaxing, Hai'ning, Linping, Jiading, Qingpu, and other places, resulting in a daily decrease in the arrival of fish and seafood in this city. They requested that the sources of supply be unblocked. After receiving the document, the Social Affairs Bureau immediately sent a telegram to the Construction Departments of Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces, instructing the subordinate cities and counties to allow the passage of fish and seafood passing through their territories in order to increase the supply to this city.</p>

<p>[Our Report] A fire suddenly broke out in the home of Fang Shourin, a resident of 10 Qinglian Street, Yimiao District, the day before yesterday, and was quickly extinguished. However, it was discovered that a large quantity of wool and other materials were hoarded in the house. The matter was secretly reported to the 39th Squad of the 8th Brigade of the Greater Shanghai Youth Service Corps. After dispatching personnel to conduct a search with the Baojia authorities, they confiscated over 1,800 pounds of wool yarn, over 1,200 wool shirts, and a large quantity of wool balls, cigarette paper, twill fabric, steel frames, steel wires, umbrella handles, and other materials.

<p>[Our Report] The 3rd Brigade of the Greater Shanghai Youth Service Corps discovered yesterday that the Dade Cotton Cloth Factory at 149 Yulin Road was engaged in black market activities and hoarding tens of thousands of pounds of cowhide glue and other materials.

This program ended on the 28th of this month, and the allocation was completed. In order to continue supplying this city and other areas and to manage the process more strictly, a special meeting of member representatives was convened at 2:00 PM this afternoon. After discussion, it was decided that, in order to continue supplying this city, 10% of the total registered sugar inventory of each member would be initially contributed, and more would be contributed in stages. For sugar already sold to customers, if an agreement to terminate the contract has been reached, the sugar should be reported to the association for unified management at the fixed price and may not be sold freely. In addition, starting from the 25th installment of the Taiwan Sugar allocation, each sugar merchant who purchases the sugar will contribute 40% of it to supply other areas, which will be allocated by the association in a unified manner.</p>

When Commander Xuan Tiewu met with a Central News Agency reporter, he spoke about this issue, saying that he had instructed his subordinates to study the regulations and plans issued by the Ministry of National Defense regarding the implementation of overall war, and to formulate implementation measures based on the actual situation in the Shanghai-Songhu area, which would be submitted to the Ministry of National Defense for suggestions. Xuan continued to answer reporters' questions about the recent chaotic situation of panic buying in the city, and what measures the security authorities would take. He said that he was closely monitoring the panic buying trend, and the relevant parties were trying to restore the economy to normal. He believes that "the problem of eating" is the most important and should be resolved quickly, then the remaining problems can be solved gradually. Regarding the establishment of the Garrison Brigade, he said that one company could be established at the beginning of next month, and the brigade headquarters would also be established at the same time. The remaining three regiments would be established gradually depending on the fundraising situation.</p>

<p>[Also reported] Fu Zhengmo, the commander of the Shanghai Division Management District, told reporters about the issue of soldiers for the Garrison Brigade, saying that they will be enlisted through two methods: lottery and volunteers. The four regiments of the Garrison Brigade, totaling about 12,000 people, will be drawn at once, and the four regiments will be established successively, and the conscripts will also be summoned successively. Those who replace the lottery with volunteers will be limited to those who are native to the area and recommended by the Baojia People's Congress, and must be guaranteed by the Bao leader and the district leader to ensure that they "do not run away and do not violate the law." Fu revealed that after discussing with the Civil Affairs Bureau, the lottery can be implemented next month.</p>
