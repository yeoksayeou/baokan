<p>〔合衆社華盛頓十三日電〕中國駐美大使顧維鈞十三日談稱：中國政府約需値十億美元之援助，以繼續對共軍作戰，但卽使並無援助，中國亦將繼續作戰。顧氏强調稱：十億美元僅爲大概數目，使普通人士得知中國需要多少而已。顧氏籲請發表美國對華政策實言以表示同情及支持中國對共產主義作戰，因中國需要物質上援助，並需要道德上及精神上之援助。渠稱，此項宣言可促進軍民之士氣。顧氏强調從速應急援助之重要，並謂長久計劃正在此作原則上討論。</p>
<p>問以何種援助需要最亟，顧氏答稱：爲軍事配備及彈藥，因先須安定局勢，渠復稱：除應急援助以外，長期援助計劃亦屬必要。</p>
<p>顧大使證實南京及巴黎所傳，謂中美官員在華盛頓進行會談之說。渠稱，數字尙未論及，但約需値價十億美元之援助，其中約三分之二應爲軍事援助，三分之一爲經濟援助。由於此一龐大計劃費時不少，中國需要迅速具體援助。由於目前情勢之嚴重，「吾人希望援華將有更多與更迅速之方法。」</p>
<p>顧氏繼稱：凡抨擊中國政府腐敗者，應一閱政府消除腐敗之記錄與有系統之努力，在一九四七年內，曾有一萬四千名政府雇負（大部份爲地方政府雇員），因被控會汚而遭逮捕，定罪者九千案，其中許多業經執行處決，包括少將及上校各一名。</p>

<h3 id="c23">哭陳布雷先生 <a href="#c23" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e23" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">23</a></h3>
<p>總統府國策顧問陳布雷先生，於十三日展八時以心臟病突發逝世，今日在京大殮；噩耗傳出，不論識與不瞰，凡是正直好義的人民，莫不爲這一代巨人的逝世，同聲一哭；尤其是我們報人，對於這一個標準新聞記者出身翊贊國事的陳先生之逝世，更要痛哭流涕。陳先生之死，不僅是國民黨的一大損失，而且也是國家社會的一大損失。當此時局劃難之時，我們感於國事蜩螗，已至欲哭無淚的地步；而今天不假年，老成溘逝，格外增加了我們心靈的創痛！</p>
<p>陳先生的一生，燃燒着愛國救世的熱情，確信革命建國的三民主義，一本着「文章報國」的志願，幹過十五年的記者工作，在辛亥革命時期，卽在天鐸報撰文，　吹革命運動；北伐前後，陳先生在滬主持上海商報的筆政，每日社論，最爲海內所宗仰，素有「雷鳴」之稱，可謂陳先生從事記者工作的黃金時代。其後追隨總統從政二十年，以幕僚的身分，爲領袖靑旰分憂，總統近二十年來所發表的重要文電宣言，大半出自陳先生的手筆，尤其在抗戰八年期間，替總統撰擬文吿，憑其一枝生花之筆，眞不知感動了多少人民，也不知鼓舞了多少志士！誠有「立懦廉頑」的功效。我們讀陳先生的作品，雖不能像蘇子瞻稱頌韓昌黎般，說他的作品能够「文起八代之衰，道濟天下之溺」；但是陳先生的作品，因其信道篤厚，用情深沉，故能充滿了熱情，使讀者覺得字字賊摯懇切，句句理直氣壯，於不知不覺中受其感動。陳先生撰擬的文章，每一個字，每一語句，都可說是瀝盡心中的最後一滴血而寫成的。陳先生本人也常說：「大家都說我能作文，其實我只能盡心」。所謂盡心，就是他的赤忱，就是他的熱情，也就最能打動讀者的心。</p>
<p>舍陳先生的文章而言他的道德，更能令人肅然起敬。他確信三民主義，嚴守我國五千年來的民族文化，又因其不僅是富於情威的人，而且也是富於理智的人，所以他信道之篤厚，在道喪文衰的今日，恐無出其右者。而且陳先生那種淡泊名利持躬謹嚴的風度，尤不易多得。他追隨總統從政廿年，隨時有做「大官」的機會，隨時有發「大財」的可能：但是他寗願一生以文字爲業，以幕僚終身·講到他的私人生活，更是淸苦不堪，始終保持文人的風格，含辛茹苦，安之若素，不以爲念；直到他臨終的最後一剎那，他最所懷念的，不是他的身後問題，而仍是民族國家的前途。誠如范仲淹所說的「先天下之憂而憂，後天下之樂而樂」，稱他爲國士，可以當之無愧。</p>
<p>平時我們與陳先生談及國事，他總以國家的前途爲憂，以領袖的辛勞爲念，陳先生因體弱關係，早就有退休療養之意；但是一轉念及領袖的日夜辛勞，便覺得義不容辭，不能不力疾從公。陳先生那樣的公忠體國，那樣的愛護領袖，求於並世朝野人士中，是不多見的。陳先生對於當前國是，懂得最透徹，對於世界大局，看得最淸楚，他有他扭轉乾坤的大計；但天不假年，陳先生竟先撒手長逝了；在陳先生本人而言，可以說已做到了「鞠躬　瘁死而後已」，他的在天之靈也可以安息了。但在我們全國人民受了這位巨人之死的震動，自應以此爲起點，格外奮發有爲，發揚陳先生一生義勇的精神，扭轉乾坤，以慰陳先生在天之靈。</p>

<p>〔合衆社巴黎十三日電〕聯合國政治委員會今日以三十六對六票，又七票棄機（大部份係阿拉伯國家），否決蘇聯要求五强减削軍備三分之一及廢止原子武器之建議，雖然蘇聯代表維辛斯基曾大聲指斥美國正圖計劃以原子武器攻擊蘇聯之新「珍珠港事件」·另一類似蘇聯提案之波蘭建議案亦遭否決。委員會又以四十對六票又一票棄權，通過前經裁軍特委會大冬數所同意之比利時計劃，內容係要求安理會及所屬之普通軍備委員會繼續此方面之工作，並要求成立國際管制機構，以收集核對並公佈各會員國之軍備及部隊情報，並向下屆大會提出報吿。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社巴黎十三日電〕在表決比利時建議時，政委會又以卅三票對六票並八票之棄權，通過法國之修正案，規定國際軍備管制機構應隸屬於安理會之下·又以廿二票對七票並十二票棄權，通過叙利亞之修正案，規定裁削軍備之具體結果應儘速獲致，不可託言等待國際局勢之改善，在政委會辯論蘇聯與比利時之建議時，烏克蘭代表　紐斯基支持蘇聯之建議·曼紐斯基答覆英國所提建立英烏外交關係之問題時稱，在建立是項外交關係前，烏克蘭應先取得其德國賠款。南斯拉夫代表西米爾亦支持蘇聯之建議，渠並指出西德之局勢稱，如德國戰爭工業能得恢復，則德國之戰爭機構卽不難重建，如美國協助西德戰爭機構之重建，則德境之英美雙佔區將立卽變成歐洲中危險之軍事基地，咸脅歐洲與全世界之和平」。法國代表建議比利時提案中之國際管制組織，應由安理會設立，然安理會對此事討論時不應有否決權。</p>

<p>〔合衆社巴黎十三日電〕英外交部發言人十三日評述聯合國領袖所發動之「和平呼籲」稱，蘇聯早已明瞭如何解決柏林危機，卽解除封鎖是也。英發言人稱，蘇聯接受賴依及伊伐特兩人所發起之大國談判呼籲，對於安定柏林封鎖之事甚少裨益。美英兩國高級官員在私下對賴依與伊伐特之干涉柏林局勢表示「驚奇」。英外交發言人此一聲明，乃官方對賴·伊兩人之聯合建議之第一次反響。另一官方稱，此一呼籲單獨對蘇聯而發，蓋西方國家已表示願意接受折衷解決辦法。該方又稱，英官方仍堅持不可能對德國一般問題作談判直至蘇聯解除柏林之封鎖。</p>

<p>（一）由於兩月來的限價束縛，一且解放，人心看好，物價上漲，如脫羈之野馬，漲風已超過生產成本與通貨發行額，故人心稍稍冷靜時，此種盲目的漲風，立卽回落，</p>

<p>（三）由於物價在短期內，猛升數倍以至數十倍不等，於是通貨不敷週轉，籌碼短絀，銀根奇緊，暗息陡升，創達四五元的新紀錄，因此商人不得不拋貨求現，以應付此空前的銀根緊勢。</p>
<p>（四）這一次的漲風，由於食米的缺乏，喊價狂亂，頗具領導作用。按上白粳八一九限價爲每石廿一元，以之與上週的喊價，自五六百元以至千餘元對此，上升達三五十倍，刺激人心，莫此爲甚。及後當局積極疏導米源，一面向國外訂購，一面空運贛米，對於米業運銷，盡力維護，因此米市逐步做開，週末多數米舖均已有每石五百元左右之白粳應市，使人心安定，一般物價漲風，趨於和緩。</p>
<p>在前述的因素下，商品市塲方面，紗布於週初開市，四十二支藍鳳喊價曾一度創一萬四千元的新高峯，以一萬三千元收市，隔日起逐步勁瀉，週四站八千五百元。廿一支雙馬由週初之七八千元，步降至週四之五千二百元，週末因外帮採購，略見回升。</p>
<p>龍頭細布週初爲三百八十元，週二漲跌頻繁，由四百三十元落至二百六十元，結果以三百元收盤，離末站定三賈一十元。</p>
<p>糧食方面，選初食米喊憂，最爲混亂，自數百元以至千餘元均有所　，　三以後，正常交易，漸有做開，上白粳約站七百元之譜，遞末落至五百元·油粉等喊價亦不一致，大約生油在千元至千五百元間，麵粉在百元至二百餘元間走動。</p>
<p>日用品售價，係一致由高峯盤低，固本皂由週初之四百元，步降至週末之三百元，十支小大英，由週初之一百零四元，步降至週末之七十元。</p>
<p>自財政經濟緊急處令頒行以來，實施未及三月的「金圓券發行辦法」及「人民所有金銀外幣處理辦法」，上週又經行政院通過新的「修正金圓券發行辦法」，及「修正人民所有金銀外幣處理辦法」代替了。根據修正的辦法，我們發覺重大的改變計有：</p>
<p>（一）金銀外幣准許人民持有，但除銀幣外，禁止流通買賽。</p>
<p>（二）改訂金圓券對金銀外幣的比率，計黃金每兩一千元，美鈔每元廿元，白鎭每兩十五元，銀幣每元十元。</p>
<p>（三）金圓券發行總額，以前硬性的規定爲廿億，現在修正爲「金圓券發行總額，另以命令定之」，換言之，金圓券今後發行的最高數額，已無限制。</p>
<p>（四）決定鑄造金圓，每一圓之含金量爲四·四四三四公毫·</p>
<p>（五）凡持有金圓或金圓券者，得照政府管理外匯辦法之規定購買外匯·凡以金圓券存人中央銀行指定之銀行存期滿一年者，除照章計息外，並得於存款時以與存款同額之金圓券，向存款銀行兌換金圓·在金圓未鑄成前，得按規定比率，兌取黃金或銀幣。</p>
<p>總之，這一次的修正辦法，在精神上已完全把金圓券又拖回到以前法幣時代的狀况，如何穩定今後的物價，我們還要從根本上想辦法才是。</p>

<p>上週本市銀根緊勢，益見變本加厲，演出空前嚴重的局面。考其原因，不外有下列數端：</p>
<p>（一）戰局危急，謠諑四起，游資南逃，日達數千萬元之譜。北方游資來滬者，頃卽轉輾南流，本市資金，由是枯竭。</p>
<p>（二）物價在人心惶惶中，一日數市，而且往往有價無貨，囤貨者旣扳持物資不放，頭寸之需用，自屬殺切。而頭寸之擁有者爲換得物資，其間不乏以資金移向近郊採購者，於是市間頭寸，更見匱乏。</p>
<p>（三）金圓券發行快達二十億，約爲法幣發行額的十倍左右，但各項物價與「八一九」限價相較，已超過十倍以上，甚至有超過四十倍者，通貨數量物價兩相比較，週轉籌碼自感短絀。</p>
<p>（四）物價躍漲暗息高昂的結果，行莊存款，紛紛逃避，行莊方面爲自衛計，一方面決定逐步緊縮客戶透放，並加緊催回欠款，另一方面則限制提現以應付嚴重的鈔荒。這對於緊俏的銀根，自然又成爲一重新壓力。本市的銀根，就在這些驚濤駭浪的衝擊下，演出了空前緊歛的一幕。</p>
<p>週四上午，銀根緊勢，可謂已抵達登峯造極的境地，例如以暗息來說，週一已經從九角喊到一元半，創造了前所未有的記錄，但週二暗息再登高峯，喊到三元，亦卽拆借一千塊錢，每天卽需—百元的代價，眞是駭人聽聞，週三暗息維持二元四至三元的高價。週四上午，銀根一度緊極，暗息亦如脫羈之馬，一度直騰六元高峯，這眞堪稱是震中外鑠古今的高利貸了。大局的嚴重，亦可概見·幸虧週四中午以後，外埠匯款大量湧到，才解了銀根的重圍，暗息亦直瀉至一元四角，回復到週一的勢態，這不異給極度緊張的金融市塲舒展了一口氣</p>
<p>銀根緊歛的另一測計是退票的遽增，週三平均每十五張票據中卽有一退票，週二錢莊方面統計退票佔票據收付總額的二分之一，週四平均每八張票據卽有退票一張，世亂見人心，危急關頭，商業信用也大打折扣了！</p>
<p>在這樣一個時期，商業行莊的處境實在太艱危了。存款逃避，缺單普遍變成了業內的家常便飯，但說到收回欠款本息，却又是談何容易。銀錢業只有靠提高掛牌利息來聊以自慰，上週曾有二度提高掛息，第一次爲週一，存息自六分漲到九分，欠息自一角八漲到二角七分，同業拆息自一角五分漲到二角二分半。第二次定週五開始提高，存息提至一角三分半，欠息提至三角九分。但以提高後的利息與市息相較，相去仍建十倍光景，顯然行莊要憑這種辦法來恢復牠的業務，還是無濟於事的！</p>
<p>上週內匯率仍無更動，外匯行情的主要變動乃週四行政院通過修正金圓券發行辦法及修正人民所有金銀外幣處理辦法。按照這個辦法，人民似乎又得持有金銀與外幣了。辦法又更動了金銀外幣與金圓券的比率，計黃金一兩合金圓券一千元，美鈔一元合金圓券二十元，銀幣一元合金圓券十元，其間除銀元外，仍禁止自由流通買賣。此外，當局宣稱將開始鑄造金幣，凡金圓券存儲滿一年者，將依法價兌換是項金幣。這自然是一種「遠期支票」，至於當局是否能憑藉此種辦怯收縮一下泛濫的金圓券，尙須視政府過去對於人民的債信而定。</p>
<p>至於出口貿易與僑匯是否會因此而有所增加，則必須看黑市價格的是否存在而定，爲了增加僑匯與出口貿易的外匯收入，在通貨膨脹的大環境中，金銀外匯法價的遞次調整，恐又將成爲必要，這雖然是法幣時代的舊路，然而，所不同的，中有產者，如今已經被整肅了，增加僑匯或出口貿易的其他諸種條件，也已有了性質上的改變；所以，僅僅想靠外匯率的不斷的變動來刺激僑匯或促進出口，顯然是不能樂觀的</p>

<p>— 本報特派員　房滄浪</p>
<p>〔本報浦口十一日訊〕十日下千，徐州東西兩翼國軍獲得大捷的好消息，尤其是那「徐州會戰勝利基礎奠定」一行引人入勝的十字引題，振奮了津浦南段沿綫數百萬顆動盪不定的苦難人心，使若干因買不着車票終日哭喪着臉的難胞剎那間都破涕爲笑。</p>
<p>十字架形陣地百萬雄師用命</p>
<p>徐州會戰的勝利之因，在鄭汴撤守烟台轉進的前夕，早就種下。國軍統帥部在蔣總統的明智決策下，毅然決然的變更戰略，爭取主動，暫時卸下了那可能纍及徐州信陽安全的兩個大包袱，撤出開封，鄭州，以極機敏的行動，築成以徐州爲核心的十字架形陣地後，稍有現代軍事常識的人們，已經看出，這一個戰略上的重大轉變，說明政府已選擇了一種適時適地的剿匪戰略，不但可賴以確保徐州，而且穩可在那縱橫百里以徐州爲核心的十字架形陣地內，爲那驕橫自滿的陳毅，以「東方夏伯陽」自况的劉伯承，預敲喪鐘，這決不是誇張。這座九里山下的十字陣地的構成，牠的確具備了三個有利因素。（一）將氣沉着，士氣昂騰，如儒將黃百韜，饒將邱清泉，抗日宿將馮治安，孫元良等部的幹部和士兵，都有着豐富而堅韌的剿匪經驗，這幾個大兵團的兵力，在量與質方面具備了壓倒的優勢。（二）指揮靈活，配合適當，黃邱孫馮等部裝備旣佳，能穩守，能攻堅，且慣於打機動戰，加之，防綫長度寬度適宜，地形利於國軍，極易指揮，便於呼應，再益之以無堅不摧之裝甲兵團的靈合運用，使匪軍慣用「以大吃小」之戰略戰術無法下手。（三）空軍助戰因大小基地近在咫尺，補給運輸，在在靈便，益形得力，加之初冬多晴，蘇魯豫皖邊區，此時此地之地形，較易辨識，因鮮深林密菁，匪軍陣地易於暴露，鐵烏威力，足寒匪膽，徐州會戰之勝利左券，已操國軍之手，國軍以空間換取時間之戰略，顯已獲得卓著的偉續。</p>
<p>元良揚威皖北</p>
<p>以空間換取時間，積小勝而成大勝，這是今華中剿匪統帥白健生上將於廿七年初夏合兒莊大捷前對記者縱談抗日戰略所常談及兩句名言，這次徐州會戰再度大捷，實非倖致。國軍爲預謀軋斷陳劉兩匪之鉗形攻勢，獲得確切掌握津浦南段，加强徐州外圍之防禦，首先實得力於孫元良兵團，於一週間連下阜陽·蒙城·渦陽·泗縣，收復渦河兩岸數十重要據點，而揚威皖北。接續於八·九·兩日，國軍强大兵團邱淸泉將軍又以雷霆萬鈞之力，於徐州西翼黃口，（距徐九十華里）碭山（距徐一五〇華里）之綫，打垮由豫西趕來送死之陳賡匪部之九縱隊一師，四縱隊一個旅，以及陳毅匪部之兩廣縱隊兩個團，曁三·八·縱隊二個團，同時，黃百韜兵團亦在運河站（距徐一五〇華里）迄碾莊　綫也給了陳匪的二·四·六·十一·十二·十三·新七·各縱隊，一個下馬威，斃傷匪軍一萬餘之多。在今日看來，這不過是小勝，但是國軍士氣因此大振，東西兩翼國軍之戰鬥情緒之高昂爲剿匪歷次戰役中所僅見，據悉：陳毅在八日前曾親臨運河站附近督師，曾槍決作戰不力之團長一名，當晚卽將其指揮部後移至台趙支綫中一小村中。</p>
<h3 id="c97">百韜百戰百勝　福將不眠不休 <a href="#c97" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e97" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">97</a></h3>
<p>據可靠的情報，估計這次陳匪侵入濟南後，躊躇滿志，時思邀功，對於徐州核心及其外圍國軍實力估計錯誤，乃盲目傾其魯中一部及魯西·魯南匪部約十五個縱隊，再凑合陳賡·劉伯承·張光中等匪部十餘縱隊，曁所謂「民兵」，其第一錢兵力總數約在卅萬以上，滿以爲可在徐州外圍東翼，擊潰國軍黃兵團後，卽可直拊徐州之側背，輕取彭城，不意在十·十一·十二·三天中，又在隴海東路之碾莊，八義集一綫，大吃敗仗，傷亡匪軍至三萬七千人之多，其精銳之一·二·七·九·各縱隊主力，已喪失過半，銳氣大挫。而在國軍方面，這百戰百勝的黃百韜將軍所部雖有傷亡，祗不過四五千人·這一個硬仗的價値，足與今年之豫東大捷相埒，所以當捷音傳到彭城後，身負徐州安危的劉經扶將軍，立刻以興奮愉快之語氣，鄭重報捷於最高統帥蔣總統，同時卽傳令嘉獎，黃百韜將軍所部官兵，大予鼓勵，當可再接再厲，予陳匪以更大打擊，以完成保衛大徐州之神聖使命。當徐州東西兩翼捷報頻傳之當日，（十一日）白健生上將特由漢飛徐，面授各將領殲匪計劃。白上將對於徐州會戰之必勝信心，可能在今後數日內有更輝煌更偉大之戰續發現。福將劉峙，據說不眠不休，達五晝夜之久。現在由於戰局轉好，經濟轉穩，前綫與後方大家都在從好處想了，但是前方將士的辛勞，大家應該有一個深刻的認識，應該各盡所能，展開一個廣泛的勞軍運動，以迎接那旋乾轉坤的偉大戰績，來减除痛苦無比的匪禍。於此，記者可以附帶報吿於讀者以前的，就是剿匪軍事的眞正勝利，今日已由徐州開始，這一點可從戰事愈接近前方，物價愈低，人心愈安定的好消息中看出。徐州的大米，每石已跌到一百卅元，猪肉每斤不到十元，日用品亦相當便宜，前方的商人已經拿出他們的良心了。</p>

<p>— 翼君</p>
<p>一個敎師的工作是够苦了的。以我爲例，我敎兩班國文，担任一班導師，和主持圖書館；每週的經常工作是·敎課十二節，批改作文簿一百零九本，筆記簿一百零九本，週記簿六十三本，批閱大楷一百二十六頁，小楷一百二十六頁；此外，圖書館及訓育等瑣事，還未計及。事情旣有這樣多，所以每天自天明至天暗，除了等車擠車外，其餘的時間，不是在敎室內大聲疾呼，就是在工作室內手不停揮（甚至連星期日也要忙碌一天），而在敎室內的大聲疾呼，並不像在戲臺上表演話劇那樣能博得觀衆的讚賞，在工作室內的手不停揮，也不像看小說，寫文章那樣的趣味盎然，尤其是在批改學生的文字時，更是弄得頭昏眼花，腰酸臂脹，因爲他們的文字，不是茅盾，巴金之流的小說，不是曹禹，田漢之流的戲劇，不是魯迅，沫若之流的選集，不是艾靑，臧克家之流的新詩；是什麼呢？大都是一篇篇的糊塗賬，混亂不淸，是些「高山打鼓，不通不通」的未成熟的東西；錯字別字連篇累牘，好像大家都有些改造漢字的雄心似的。</p>

<p>我們的苦悶是生活問題，也就是待遇問題。說起我們的待遇，在學期之初，是比較算好的。再以我爲例，我每月薪俸是金圓券一百零四元，較之普通公敎人負要高一二十元之多，而且一次就發五個月，發後不及一月，看看情勢不對，又把最後一個月的薪水掃數發淸。因此，朋友們都說我的待遇「很好」，我自己也覺得似乎不錯。可是，現在限價取消了，百物上漲，而且是漲勢很兇，就我所知的，火車漲到五倍，一封平信漲到二十倍，擦皮鞋由一角漲到三角，大餅由十萬漲到六十萬，我們學校敎員伙食，每天的小菜錢，由二元被迫增至六元，就是最難漲價的公敎人員待遇也增了一倍半了。只有我們當私校敎師的，眼巴巴的看百物上漲，看他人加錢，自己是再也拿不到分文了，早先拿到的錢，又早已變爲別人「無盡的寶贜」之一部分；生活焉得不成問題，又焉得不苦悶呢？</p>
<p>也許有人要說：「你們的薪水，假使不作一次發掉，也按月發給，何至於弄到這樣呢？」</p>
<p>先生，你這話是並未經過思索的。如果按月發給，這時候，若同公敎人員比，他們增一倍半，我們便等於减一倍半；同火車，比他們增五倍，我們便等於减五倍；若同大餅比，他們增六倍，我們便等於减六借；若同一封信比，他們增二十倍，我們便等於减二十倍。這還是只就本月本旬而言，恐時間愈後，我們的薪俸便要等於减到零了；怎麽好按月發給呢？</p>
<p>而事實上也竟有一部分私校是按月發但不按月調整的，那就更慘了。</p>
<p>我們的工作，雖苦，而不悶，我們的生活，却苦到瀕於悶絕的境地了。</p>
<h3 id="c108">在四流電影院中 <a href="#c108" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e108" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">108</a></h3>
<p>— 靖文</p>
<p>在此大家愁柴愁米之時，我居然還有興趣於假期的那一天率領了幾個孩子在居處附近的一家四流電影院中去看電影，眞可說是對於生活環境「木知木覺」了，或者可說是生活心理已經麻痺。而且身邊的餘款僅够買一磅餅乾，此後數天的「伙食」一無着落。如此「作樂」，正無異俗語所謂「黃連樹下操琴」。</p>
<p>但肚子中旣暫塞飽了紅米飯和靑菜蘿葡，孩子們在家中又不有安靜，他們的小心靈中並無絲毫恐慌和煩愁，而且知道昨天「爸爸領了薪水」，這小小的竹槓總是免不了的了。况且自己悶坐在家中，亦無非多消耗幾支紙烟，也足抵得上四流電影院中的票價了。</p>
<p>事實證明患生活麻痺感的不止我一個人，連跑了兩家都早已客滿（雖離開映還有半小時餘），門外仍是人山人海，完全一派昇平氣象。好容易在第三處買到了票子，而更幸運的是居然找到了座位，未及五分鐘，不僅座無虛席，就連兩旁梯級和走道中全擠滿了人。</p>
<p>原來這四流電影院是向來沒有對號入座制度的，戲院老闆唯求多多益善。如果這裏也掛出了客滿牌，那不僅因爲是座無虛席，而是因爲裏面連站脚的地方都難找了。</p>
<p>我望着旁邊站着以及坐在樓梯階級上的男女老少觀衆，一面慶幸自已早來了一步，一面却不禁感到我們的老百姓實在是太好說話了。雖然票價不算高，但他們總是化了錢的觀衆，至低限度應該給他們安排一個座位，現在却讓他們席地坐在冰冷的水門汀樓梯級上或挨着牆壁站着，反觀座上却不乏不化錢的特殊觀衆，交腿高踞，對出錢觀衆的窘境視若無睹，一若這是當然的。</p>
<p>這雖然是四流電影院中的一慕，而且大家早已對此不以爲奇，但據我想，中國所以雖有躋身世界列强的機會而始終降在四流國地位者，這四流電影院就是一個寫照。</p>
<p>做老闆的祗知道要錢，滿口天花亂墜，猶如銀幕上的鏡花水月，可望而不可卽，祗是供你「娛樂」「娛樂」罷了。最可憐的是出了錢的觀衆不知道自己應享的權利，任人擺佈，水門汀就是水門汀，站着就站着，不僅不敢抗議，甚至絕少有人抱怨·常我在散塲的觀衆中聽幾位老太太在說「戲倒是蠻好的，祗是腿都站硬了」時，不禁苦笑速連。</p>
<p>我懷疑觀衆的耐心是否會永無止境。戲院老　一味要錢，特權者祗高踞上座，觀衆縱有耐心，恐也有要鬧「退票」的一天吧。這雖然是四流電影院中的事，但又豈止是四流電影院的事。</p>

<h3 id="e1">Frequent Jubilant Reports from the Eastern Xuzhou Front: Eight Bandit Regiments Annihilated Near Nianzhuang; Over Twenty Strongholds Captured; Two Forces Joined Up <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>[Report from our Nanjing office, 14th] Military News Agency's urgent telegram from Xuzhou at 8 PM on the 14th: Another piece of good news from the eastern Xuzhou front. The advancing forces along the Longhai Railway have crushed the resistance of the bandit army at places like Bayiji, and have now joined forces with General Huang Botao's troops.</p>
<p>[Report from our Nanjing office, 14th] Military News Agency's urgent telegram from the front lines of Xuzhou at 9:30 PM on the 14th: The powerful national army on the eastern front is advancing eastward along the Longhai Railway, winning every battle and proving invincible. At 6 PM on the 14th, they annihilated eight bandit regiments near Nianzhuang, recapturing over twenty strongholds in one fell swoop. The remaining bandits are still putting up stubborn resistance, and the national army is intensifying its fierce attack. Overall, the bandits have suffered over 80,000 casualties under the combined intensive firepower of our land and air forces over the past few days. The banks of the Grand Canal are littered with bandit corpses, delivering a severe blow to the invading bandits.</p>
<p>[Report from our Nanjing office, 14th] Military News Agency's urgent telegram from Xuzhou at 5 PM on the 14th: The bandit Chen Yi's 8th and 3rd columns, and the bandit Chen Geng's 9th column, which were previously wounded in Dangshan, infiltrated and harassed strongholds such as Wazikou (northwest of Suxian), Jiagou, and Fuliji on the west side of the Jinpu Railway on the 13th. After a day and night of fierce fighting following our powerful forces' interception, over 5,000 bandits were killed. Observers generally believe that this move by the bandit army was an attempt to reverse their decline on the eastern Xuzhou front, but their attempt has clearly failed.</p>
<p>[Report from our Xuzhou office, 14th] The powerful national army advancing eastward captured the important strongholds of Yangjiaoshan, Dengjiale, Fanjiahu, and the eastern and western Liang villages, located seven kilometers south of Damiao, at 2 PM yesterday, annihilating the entire 11th bandit column and routing the 2nd and 7th columns. The remaining bandits fled eastward, and the national army followed and pursued them. At 3 PM this afternoon, the important strongholds of Mashan, located four kilometers southwest of Daxujia, were captured. The national army from the north and south will officially join forces in Mashan. Thus far, the 2nd, 7th, and 11th bandit columns have been eliminated. The national army is confident of victory in the Xuzhou campaign and is continuing to advance rapidly eastward.</p>
<p>[Report from our Xuzhou office, 14th] The powerful national army advancing eastward launched an attack on the main force of the bandit Chen's 1st, 7th, and 10th columns in the mountainous area 20 kilometers east of Xuzhou and south of Damiao on the morning of the 13th. The national army's land, air, artillery, and mechanized units launched a fierce attack on the bandits. In two hours of fierce fighting, they captured important strongholds such as Dengzhuang, Weizhuang, Shengjia'an, Xiaoji, Yinshan, and Xueshan, killing and wounding over 5,000 bandits. They also surrounded a bandit regiment at Jianshan, and are currently concentrating on annihilating them, seizing over twenty light and heavy machine guns, over seven hundred rifles, and over ten artillery pieces.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Xuzhou, 14th] Military News: The eastward advancing forces in Xuzhou today continued their victories by successively capturing over twenty strongholds, including Wangqiao, Yuanshan, Xueshan, Dingjialou, Liujiawei, Mashan, Chishan, Luanshishan, and Wangzhaozhuang Jianshan. The aforementioned strongholds are all located in mountainous areas 40 to 50 li southwest of Nianzhuang. The bandits stationed troops at each stronghold to resist and delay our advance, but the national army destroyed them one by one. The fighting was extremely fierce, and the fields were littered with bandit corpses, with the remnants fleeing in all directions. The eastward advancing forces have annihilated a total of eight bandit regiments in the past three days, including three regiments at Damiao and Yuanshan, two regiments at Xiaoji, and one regiment each at Jianshan, Dingjialou, and Dongzhuang. The lead tank units of the eastward advancing forces are not far from Nianzhuang.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Xuzhou, 14th] According to front-line news at 12 noon on the 14th, General Qiu Qingquan's forces, advancing eastward, repelled the gradual resistance of the Qian bandit's 1st, 7th, and 10th columns in the Damiao area on the 13th, and continued to advance eastward in a fan shape with overwhelming force. Among them, the tanks commanded by Colonel Chiang Wei-kuo were approaching Nianzhuang. On the morning of the 14th, large formations of B-24 type aircraft from the air force also flew over Nianzhuang to provide support. The Huang forces, who were firmly defending Nianzhuang, were breaking out from the core to cooperate with the Qiu forces in a combined attack on the stubborn bandits. A grand and heroic battle of annihilation is currently unfolding on the vast plains west of the Grand Canal and south of the Bulao River, and the bandits are beginning to collapse.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Xuzhou, 14th] Commander-in-Chief Liu Zhi and Deputy Commander-in-Chief Du Yuming have both gone to the front lines to supervise the battle, further boosting morale.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Xuzhou, 14th] The curfew here was once again advanced to 6 PM tonight, and a major inspection was carried out.</p>
<h3 id="e2">Another Major Battle Forms South of Xuzhou; Bandits Detour from the Western Flank to Invade Suqian County <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Xuzhou, 14th] In the Xuzhou campaign, another major battle, following Nianzhuang, has now formed on the southern front of Xuzhou near the suburbs of Suqian County. Four columns of Chen and Liu's bandit forces and a portion of local communists, detouring south from the western flank of Xuzhou, infiltrated the southern section of the Jinpu Railway after passing through Yongcheng and Xiaoxian, and began to invade Suqian County before dawn this morning. Fierce fighting is still ongoing as of noon. Powerful national army forces are advancing towards the outer edges of Suqian County from both the north and south.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Xuzhou, 14th] The civilian armed forces of Tong, Feng, Pei, Xiao, and Dang counties in northern Jiangsu, under the command of Commander Ma Zigu, have been cooperating with the national army in combat for several days, achieving repeated successes. Last night, various units of civilian armed forces in the areas of Jiahe, Zhengzhai, and Huangji in the west of Xuzhou, and Taoshan and Nangu Mountain in the south, made contact with the outposts of Chen's 8th and Liangguang columns, achieving considerable gains.</p>
<p>[Report from our Bengbu office, 14th] The bandits attacking Suqian, numbering two columns, engaged in fierce fighting with the defending troops at Beiguan yesterday and today. By dusk, the bandits had collapsed and retreated. This morning, the bandits harassed Longwangfu, Fuliji, Lizhuang, and Jiagou, and the roads were destroyed. A bandit force south of Suqian was repelled before dawn.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 14th] The railway between Zhangbaling and Shimenshan on the southern section of the Jinpu Railway, which was destroyed on the 13th, was repaired on the morning of the 14th, and traffic between Pukou and Bengbu has fully resumed. An additional mixed train was dispatched from Pukou to Bengbu this afternoon.</p>
<h3 id="e3">Bandit Army Disregards Humanitarianism and Releases Large Amounts of Poison Gas <a href="#e3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Xuzhou, 14th] After our eastern front Huang forces defeated the advance of more than nine columns of Chen Yi's bandit forces on the line between Nianzhuang and Bayiji on the 13th, the bandits, in order to salvage their declining morale, disregarded humanitarianism and acted like beasts, releasing large amounts of suffocating and tear gas in the area north of Zhao Zhuang Bayiji on the evening of the 13th. Over 400 of our officers and soldiers on that line were poisoned at the time, and one of our battalions at Zhao Zhuang was completely poisoned, suffocating and sacrificing themselves. All of our officers and soldiers on the entire line were filled with outrage at this cruel and brutal national traitor, and vowed to never coexist with them. Some of the rescued officers and soldiers are still in a coma due to a lack of medical supplies. Our army has taken photographs and reported the incident. It has been found that the bandit army that released the poison gas was the New 8th Column and the 3rd Column, which were attacking our southeast sides. When our army was poisoned, it was during the bandits' counterattack at night, and our army hopes that people of justice around the world will issue warnings to the bandits.</p>

<p>[Report from our Zhenjiang office, 14th] The remnants of Guan Wenwei's bandit forces in the Northern Jiangsu Military District, and about ten thousand troops from the Jingtai, Tairu, Qidong, and Gaoxing independent regiments, gathered and attacked Jiangyan (an important town east of Tai County) at 11 PM on the 13th. A certain unit of the national army fought desperately with a very small number of troops, waiting for reinforcements. As of 8 PM on the 14th, they were still engaging in interception. Currently, people from the county living in the province are requesting that teams be dispatched to provide assistance to various relevant parties.</p>
<p>[Report from our Jiangdu office, 14th] The bandits entrenched in Daqiao (southeast of Yangzhou) fled to Sima yesterday after being pressured by powerful units of the national army for several days. The national army has now stationed troops in Daqiao.</p>

<p>[Central News Agency, Taiyuan, 14th] The battle situation in the suburbs of Taiyuan on the 14th was like the calm before a storm. Only sparse artillery fire could be heard in the area within ten li of the city's eastern perimeter. This is because the attacking bandits have gradually entered our pre-arranged fortress fire zone and are showing signs of hesitation. The bandits are currently actively reorganizing and building fortifications, and the national army is also strengthening its deployment. A certain military observer predicts that a large-scale battle of annihilation will break out in the eastern suburbs within days. Our iron wing units are soaring in the sky all day long, carrying out reconnaissance and bombing of the bandits.</p>
<p>[Report from our Beiping office, 14th] After the fall of Nanbeiyan and Naoma on the outskirts of Taiyuan, the Taiyuan war has become urgent near the suburbs. The bandits descending south from Naoma attacked Yangjiayu again last night, resulting in fierce fighting. Shells have landed within the city. Yan Xishan has telegraphed Yang Aiyuan again, requesting an audience with the president to seek rapid assistance.</p>
<p>[Report from our Gubeikou office, 13th] Due to strategic planning, the national army in Chengde took the initiative to withdraw on the 12th. Provincial Chairman Sun Du led all staff members and personnel from various agencies to relocate to Miyun on the same day, under the cover of the original military steps. A large number of pedestrians are expected to pass through Gubeikou on the 14th. This reporter also withdrew to the area at the same time and arrived safely in Gubeikou on the 13th. Having witnessed all the scenes of the retreat, I have a detailed understanding. (1) At 8 AM, all sentry posts in the city were removed, order collapsed, and mobs scrambled to loot each other. All agencies were ransacked. (2) The rearguard of the defending army launched a feigned attack eastward toward Chengde at midnight, detouring north of Chengde, so the bandit army did not dare to advance rashly. (3) At 3 PM, 300 Chengde self-defense forces in the rear were intercepted by bandits in the Luan River. (4) At 5 PM, the bandit army patrolled to Sengmao Mountain and fired multiple shells at the city and the detached palace. Knowing it was an empty city, they began to descend the mountain and occupy Chengde. (5) It was discovered that the bandit army occupying Chengde was Li Yunchang's 9th Column, numbering about ten thousand people. Other local bandits and the vanguard bandit units had followed suit and fled westward. On the 13th, Zhangbaiwan on the Cheng-Gu road was also occupied by the bandits. The foremost defense line of the national army was set up around Luanping, and both sides were at daggers drawn. Gubeikou seems to have approached the prelude to the siege and defense.</p>
<p>[Report from our Gubeikou office, 14th] The withdrawal from Chengde has been successfully completed on the 14th to fulfill its proactive mission. Unshipped military-affiliated residual materials and the Lian Guan She Building were burned. Only a small number of agency staff members failed to evacuate, while the main equipment of the Telegraph Bureau was secretly withdrawn to the west with the army beforehand, and its effectiveness was uninterrupted, which is particularly gratifying. Other communications such as the post office and economics such as the bank all arrived completely in Gubeikou, but 3,000 tons of civilian grain collected from the autumn protection work did not have time to be transported out. Reporter's note: Since the spring of the 22nd year of the Republic of China, the province has been occupied for 13 years. After the victory, the provincial government was established in Chongqing on October 16 of the 34th year of the Republic of China. After the New Year, Liu Duoquan followed the army and stationed in Chaoyang. Chengde was recovered on August 29 of the 35th year of the Republic of China. The government-controlled area had reached up to 16 counties. After June of this year, only Chengde and the Cheng-Gu line remained. For the past three years, the military has been solely supported by Shi Jue's forces, and the political affairs have been changed three times by Liu Duoquan, Fan Hanjie, and Sun Du.</p>

<p>[Report from our Beiping office, 14th] A certain unit of the national army stationed in Baoding has withdrawn northward along the Pingbao line on the 12th and has safely arrived near Dingxing on the 14th. A certain division commander, Liu Huanan, took office as the commander of the Baoding city defense on the 13th. The combat personnel in Baoyuan have withdrawn with the northward advancing national army on the 12th. The commissioner, the director of the provincial capital police department, the Central Bank, news reporters, some local agencies and organizations, and family members of soldiers all withdrew to Zhuoxian and Beiping on the evening of the 13th. Students from various colleges and universities in Baoyuan are currently preparing to come to Beiping. This reporter stationed in Bao safely withdrew to Ping on the 13th.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Beiping, 14th] The remnants of the Nie bandits' 3rd, 4th columns and the 4th brigade of the 2nd column on the Pingbao line have suffered heavy losses after being continuously attacked and captured by powerful units of the national army. From the night of the 13th to the dawn of the 14th, they were forced to flee in the mountainous areas west of Yixian and Mancheng.</p>

<p>[Report from our Beiping office, 14th] The representatives of the National Assembly from the Northeast, who have fled to Beiping, gathered today to review the Northeast withdrawal. They unanimously believed that the responsibility for Wei Lihuang's command errors should be investigated. They also pushed representatives to investigate the materials of various Northeast agencies stored in Ping, Tianjin, Beijing, Shanghai, and other places, to be fairly distributed to various Northeast units to provide relief to escaped public and religious personnel and refugees.</p>

<p>[Report from our Beiping office, 14th] Senior North China officials revealed: Since Commander-in-Chief Fu returned to Ping from Beijing, he has accepted opinions from all parties and deliberated deeply. He has a complete plan for adapting to the current situation and reforming the military and political affairs of North China, and will begin to implement the powers granted by the central government with a firm pace, including the strengthening of military forces, the training of the people, and the unified allocation of all manpower and materials for combat. He will also uniformly command the central government's agencies and state-owned enterprises in North China. This morning, Fu revealed the details of the new policy for the first time in an excited and firm tone, first emphasizing the need to refresh the institutions in peacetime. The North China Suppression Headquarters will establish an agency similar to a political affairs committee, concentrating command of the military, political, economic, and cultural and educational departments of North China, and cultivating a large number of new cadres to take on arduous tasks. As for the existing provincial, municipal, and county institutions, they will be reduced to the minimum possible extent, and a large number of cadres will be extracted to implement talents and funds in the countryside, requiring civil servants to perform village duties day and night. Fu stated: He does not restrict those who are wavering from flowing south, and is willing to help solve transportation problems to promote their early departure and purify the ranks. Mr. Leighton Stuart had a long talk with Fu in Ping on the 13th and promised to do his best to support Fu. US aid materials are actively being transported north ahead of schedule. The communist bandits on the North China battlefield are currently hesitating and not advancing. Various counties in Chahar and Sui are successively recovering various cities and towns. Fu said: There is infinite vitality in the heavy situation in North China.</p>
<p>[Report from our Beiping office, 14th] Fu Zuoyi visited the Ping Police Bureau at 10:30 this morning and summoned personnel above the cadre level for a lecture, which lasted an hour, explaining that the current situation is even more difficult than the War of Resistance, and encouraging them to fight for survival together.</p>
<h3 id="e15">Ambassador Gu Says in Washington That We Need One Billion US Dollars in US Aid; Two-Thirds Should Be Military Aid; Appeals to the United States to Issue a Declaration of Its China Policy <a href="#e15" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c15" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">15</a></h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 13th] Chinese Ambassador to the United States Gu Weijun said on the 13th that the Chinese government needs approximately one billion US dollars in aid to continue fighting the communist army, but even without aid, China will continue to fight. Gu emphasized that one billion US dollars is only an approximate figure so that ordinary people can know how much China needs. Gu appealed for the release of a statement of US policy towards China to show sympathy and support for China's fight against communism, because China needs material assistance, and also needs moral and spiritual assistance. He said that this declaration could boost the morale of the military and civilians. Gu emphasized the importance of speedy emergency assistance and said that long-term plans are being discussed in principle.</p>
<p>When asked what kind of assistance was most urgently needed, Gu replied: Military equipment and ammunition, because the situation must first be stabilized. He also said: In addition to emergency assistance, a long-term assistance plan is also necessary.</p>
<p>Ambassador Gu confirmed the reports from Nanjing and Paris that Sino-US officials are holding talks in Washington. He said that the figures have not yet been discussed, but approximately one billion US dollars in aid is needed, of which approximately two-thirds should be military aid and one-third should be economic aid. Because this huge plan will take a lot of time, China needs rapid and concrete assistance. Due to the seriousness of the current situation, "we hope that there will be more and faster ways to help China."</p>
<p>Gu continued: Those who criticize the corruption of the Chinese government should read the government's records of eliminating corruption and its systematic efforts. In 1947, 14,000 government employees (mostly local government employees) were arrested for being accused of corruption, and 9,000 cases were convicted, many of which have been executed, including one major general and one colonel each.</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 13th] Democratic Congressman Mansfield, who was sent by the late President Roosevelt as an observer to China during the war, proposed on the 13th that the United States adopt a bipartisan policy on the issue of aid to China, just like the aid to Europe. However, calling a special session of Congress to discuss aid to China can only be done by the President after being advised by Secretary of State Marshall.</p>

<h3 id="e23">Crying for Mr. Chen Bu Lei <a href="#e23" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c23" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">23</a></h3>
<p>Mr. Chen Bu Lei, National Policy Advisor to the President, passed away suddenly from a heart attack at 8:00 PM on the 13th. The coffin will be sealed in Nanjing today. When the sad news spread, whether acquainted or unacquainted, all upright and righteous people mourned the passing of this giant of his generation. Especially for us journalists, we must weep bitterly for the passing of Mr. Chen, who came from the ranks of standard news reporters to assist the government. Mr. Chen's death is not only a great loss to the Kuomintang, but also a great loss to the nation and society. At this time of national crisis, we feel so overwhelmed by national affairs that we are almost at the point of being unable to cry. Today, this experienced man has passed away prematurely, which only adds to the pain in our hearts!</p>
<p>Mr. Chen's life was burning with patriotism and the desire to save the world. Believing firmly in the Three Principles of the People for revolution and nation-building, and with the ambition of "serving the nation through writing," he worked as a journalist for fifteen years. During the Xinhai Revolution, he wrote articles in the Tianduo Daily, advocating the revolutionary movement. Before and after the Northern Expedition, Mr. Chen presided over the editorial policy of the Shanghai Shangbao in Shanghai. His daily editorials were highly respected throughout the country and were known as "Thunder." This can be said to be the golden age of Mr. Chen's journalistic career. Later, he followed the President into politics for twenty years. As a staff member, he shared the leader's burdens day and night. Most of the important letters, telegrams, and declarations issued by the President in the past twenty years were written by Mr. Chen. Especially during the eight years of the War of Resistance against Japan, he drafted proclamations for the President. With his brilliant writing skills, he truly moved countless people and inspired countless patriots! He truly had the effect of "encouraging the weak and reforming the stubborn." When we read Mr. Chen's works, although we cannot praise him like Su Zizhan praised Han Changli, saying that his works could "revive the decline of the Eight Dynasties and save the drowning of the world," Mr. Chen's works, because of his sincere faith and deep emotions, were full of passion, making readers feel that every word was sincere and earnest, and every sentence was just and forceful, and they were unconsciously moved by them. Every word and every sentence in the articles drafted by Mr. Chen can be said to have been written with the last drop of blood in his heart. Mr. Chen himself often said: "Everyone says that I can write, but in fact, I can only do my best." The so-called doing his best is his sincerity, his passion, and that is what touches the hearts of readers the most.</p>
<p>Putting aside Mr. Chen's writings, his morality is even more awe-inspiring. He firmly believed in the Three Principles of the People, strictly adhered to our nation's five thousand years of national culture, and because he was not only a man of passion but also a man of reason, his faith was so deep that in today's world of declining morality and writing, perhaps no one could surpass him. Moreover, Mr. Chen's indifference to fame and wealth and his strict self-discipline were even more rare. He followed the President into politics for twenty years, and he always had the opportunity to become a "high official" and the possibility of making a "great fortune." However, he would rather spend his life working with words and remain a staff member for life. Speaking of his private life, it was even more difficult and miserable. He always maintained the style of a scholar, enduring hardships and being content with his situation, never thinking about it. Until the last moment of his life, what he missed most was not his posthumous affairs, but still the future of the nation and the country. Truly, as Fan Zhongyan said, "Be the first to worry about the world's troubles, and the last to enjoy its pleasures." He can be called a national hero without any exaggeration.</p>
<p>Usually, when we talked to Mr. Chen about national affairs, he always worried about the future of the country and was concerned about the leader's hard work. Mr. Chen had long intended to retire and recuperate due to his poor health, but when he thought about the leader's day and night hard work, he felt that it was his duty to do his best despite his illness. Mr. Chen's patriotism and his love for the leader are rare among the people in the government and the public. Mr. Chen understood the current national affairs most thoroughly, and he saw the overall situation of the world most clearly. He had a grand plan to turn the tide, but Heaven did not grant him long life. Mr. Chen passed away prematurely. As far as Mr. Chen himself is concerned, it can be said that he has done his best and given his all until his death, and his spirit in heaven can rest in peace. However, we, the people of the whole country, having been shocked by the death of this giant, should take this as a starting point, redouble our efforts, carry forward Mr. Chen's spirit of righteousness and courage, and turn the tide to comfort Mr. Chen's spirit in heaven.</p>

The rest can be transported before the Tianjin port freezes, so there is absolutely no problem with the allocation of grain from December this year to January and February next year.</p>

Mr. Mei told the reporter of the Central News Agency in a solo interview this morning: The Tribunal currently has a lot of evidence proving that the Japanese Emperor has committed various crimes and disrupted world peace.

As for some people using the clauses of the judgment for their propaganda purposes, it is not the fault of the judgment itself.

<h3 id="e46">UN Political Committee Ends Debate; Soviet Disarmament Proposal Rejected; Belgian Plan Passed by Majority Vote <a href="#e46" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c46" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">46</a></h3>
<p>[United Press, Paris, 13th] The United Nations Political Committee today rejected the Soviet proposal to reduce the armaments of the five major powers by one-third and abolish atomic weapons by a vote of thirty-six to six, with seven abstentions (mostly Arab countries). Soviet representative Vyshinsky loudly accused the United States of planning a new "Pearl Harbor" attack on the Soviet Union with atomic weapons. A similar Polish proposal was also rejected. The committee also passed the Belgian plan, previously agreed upon by a large majority of the Disarmament Special Committee, by a vote of forty to six, with one abstention. The plan calls for the Security Council and its subordinate Ordinary Armaments Committee to continue work in this area, and for the establishment of an international control agency to collect, verify, and publish information on the armaments and troops of member states, and to report to the next General Assembly.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 13th] When voting on the Belgian proposal, the Political Committee also passed a French amendment by a vote of thirty-three to six, with eight abstentions, stipulating that the international arms control agency should be subordinate to the Security Council. It also passed a Syrian amendment by a vote of twenty-two to seven, with twelve abstentions, stipulating that concrete results in arms reduction should be achieved as soon as possible, without using the improvement of the international situation as an excuse. During the Political Committee's debate on the Soviet and Belgian proposals, Ukrainian representative Manusky supported the Soviet proposal. In response to the British question about establishing diplomatic relations between Britain and Ukraine, Manusky stated that Ukraine should first obtain its German reparations before establishing such diplomatic relations. Yugoslav representative Simir also supported the Soviet proposal, pointing to the situation in West Germany, stating that if Germany's war industry could be restored, it would not be difficult to rebuild Germany's war machine. If the United States assists in the reconstruction of West Germany's war machine, the British and American occupation zones in Germany will immediately become dangerous military bases in Central Europe, threatening the peace of Europe and the world. The French representative suggested that the international control organization in the Belgian proposal should be established by the Security Council, but the Security Council should not have the power of veto when discussing this matter.</p>
<h3 id="e47">US, Britain and France Considering Response to Lie and Evatt's Peace Appeal; Still Insist on Not Negotiating Under Pressure <a href="#e47" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c47" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">47</a></h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 13th] A spokesman for the US delegation to the UN stated that the letter jointly addressed to the four major power leaders by Lie and Evatt will be answered by Marshall, but Marshall will first consult with Truman. The spokesman added that the US delegation will also consult with the British and French delegations on this letter and submit a reply in a few days.</p>
<p>[United Press, Paris, 13th] A British Foreign Office spokesman commented on the "peace appeal" launched by UN leaders, stating that the Soviet Union already knows how to resolve the Berlin crisis, namely, to lift the blockade. The British spokesman stated that the Soviet Union's acceptance of the major power negotiation appeal initiated by Lie and Evatt would be of little benefit to stabilizing the Berlin blockade. Senior US and British officials privately expressed "surprise" at Lie and Evatt's intervention in the Berlin situation. This statement by the British Foreign Office spokesman is the first official reaction to the joint proposal of Lie and Evatt. Another official stated that this appeal is directed solely at the Soviet Union, as Western countries have already expressed their willingness to accept a compromise solution. The official also stated that the British government still insists that it is impossible to negotiate general German issues until the Soviet Union lifts the Berlin blockade.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 13th] Diplomats from various countries in the Palais de Chaillot have different opinions on the letters sent by UN Secretary-General Lie and General Assembly President Evatt to the four major powers calling for the reopening of negotiations on the Berlin issue. People close to neutral countries feel satisfied with this move, but people close to the four major powers remain silent and indifferent. Security Council President Bramuglia, after consulting with representatives of various neutral countries tonight, stated that "Lie and Evatt's peace appeal is very satisfactory, as it can represent the voice of all peace-loving people and will certainly have a considerable impact on the representatives of the countries concerned." The British representatives expressed extreme silence on this matter, believing that this appeal might shift the Berlin issue from the Security Council to certain aspects of the General Assembly. Some people were surprised by this intervention in the diplomacy of major powers. One noteworthy point is that a "Third International Group" is forming, with neutral countries as its core and Bramuglia as its leader. This group is working to help the four major powers reach an agreement on the Berlin issue.</p>

If Tsaldaris and Sophoulis cannot agree, Tsaldaris may abandon hope of forming a coalition cabinet and insist on completing a completely right-wing government.</p>

<p>[United Press, Paris, 13th] UN mediator Bunche ordered Israeli and Egyptian troops on the 13th to establish a neutral "no-man's land" in the Nikif area. This plan has been approved by the seven-member group of the Security Council, but the details have not yet been announced. This plan will establish a "ceasefire line" to separate Arab and Jewish troops and will force Jewish troops to withdraw from their occupied positions. So far, neither the Arabs nor the Jews have formally accepted or rejected this plan, but the Israeli representative here has indicated that the Jewish side will withdraw from its gained positions with the utmost reluctance. The order issued by the Security Council today is the first test of the Security Council's authority in the Holy Land. Since mid-October, Jewish troops have seized most of the Nikif area, with only Faluja and Gaza still in Egyptian hands. The Security Council has also acceded to Bunche's request to convene a plenary session on the 15th to consider issuing an order to withdraw from the Galilee area in northern Holy Land.

The Shanghai Municipal Cost of Living Index Compilation and Review Committee is scheduled to hold its 17th meeting in the City Government conference room at 10:00 this morning to review and announce the cost of living index for employees for the first half of November. This index will not distinguish between staff and workers, and will be published uniformly with one number. The authorities felt it difficult to compile and review this index. When the Municipal Government meeting discussed this issue the day before yesterday, no rigid regulations were made, and there were rumors of a delay in publication. Finally, due to the trend of the situation, it was decided to publish as scheduled. According to sources concerned: The most dramatic price increases in the first half of this month compared to August 19 were for rice and flour, followed by meat, chicken, eggs, tofu, and green vegetables, all of which were around dozens of times. However, public utilities only increased by about five times. Therefore, the cost of living index for the first half of November should not exceed ten times, about eight times. The exact number can be known today. According to reports, the Index Compilation and Review Committee was suspended after the 16th meeting on August 15, following an order from the Executive Yuan to freeze the index. It has been exactly three months since then.</p>
<p>[Another Dispatch] The cost of living index for the first half of this month may not be directly published, because after the price limit was lifted, most commodity prices had a price but no market, so there was nothing to follow when compiling the index. Therefore, it is also possible that each representative will jointly formulate a salary multiple as a calculation standard during the meeting, and the index for the first half of the month will not be announced for the time being, but will be officially published at the end of the month. If half of the published index is higher than the salary multiple for the first half of the month drafted by the committee, the shortfall will be retroactively paid.</p>
<h3 id="e62">Thirty-Five Industrial Units to Hold Joint Meeting Today to Discuss Allocation of Foreign Exchange from Exported Goods <a href="#e62" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c62" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">62</a></h3>
<p>The Municipal Industrial Association is scheduled to convene a joint meeting of the heads of 35 industries, including industrial raw materials, chemical raw materials, pigments, and glass, at 3:00 pm today at the association. The focus of the meeting will be to discuss how to allocate the foreign exchange earned from exported goods. The government has previously approved the direct transfer of foreign exchange from exported goods to merchants in each industry to purchase the required raw materials for import, but the profit-sharing principle has not yet been determined. The Price Adjustment Committee is currently planning to propose 50 percent, and if necessary, 80 percent, but the raw materials required by each industry are different, and the foreign exchange profit-sharing figures also vary. Therefore, the association has specially convened 35 industrial merchants to discuss and make a final decision.</p>

<h3 id="e76">Many Merchants Still Attempting to Obtain Profiteering; Barber Shop in Front of the Social Affairs Bureau Dares to Increase Prices Fiftyfold <a href="#e76" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c76" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">76</a></h3>
<p>After the price controls were lifted, the skyrocketing prices of various commodities have recently been falling due to the impact of tight credit. However, many merchants are still continuing to adjust prices, attempting to obtain exorbitant profits. Yesterday, according to Social Affairs Bureau Director Wu Kaixian, the central government's principle of verifying costs and setting prices should be strictly followed by all industries. If prices are illegally raised or the market is incited, the Social Affairs Bureau will first provide guidance upon receiving a report, and if no results are achieved, it will immediately take action. According to investigations by reporters, the most drastic price adjustments after the lifting of price controls have been in the bathing and barber industries. For example, the Dahua Bathhouse on Junzhan Road in Nanshi, originally priced at 1.2 Gold Yuan per customer, is now charging 6 Gold Yuan, a fiftyfold increase. Furthermore, a barber shop across from the Social Affairs Bureau on Linsen Road, originally priced at 4 jiao, is now charging 20 yuan, also a fiftyfold increase. If the relevant authorities do not urgently seek to stop this, it will affect exorbitant price increases in other industries.</p>

<h3 id="e91">General Commodity Prices: Surge and Rapid Decline, Calming People's Hearts <a href="#e91" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c91" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">91</a></h3>
<p>The price trends of commodities over the past week have been characterized by a surge and rapid decline. Fluctuations within a single day have ranged from several tens of percent to as much as one hundred percent, making the volatility unprecedented.</p>
<p>At the beginning of the week, various commodities opened trading continuing the momentum from the previous weekend. The rising trend was like wildfire, with chaotic bidding, making it difficult to find a normal market. By Tuesday, it was realized that this over-excitement had several illusory factors. As a result, people became insecure, and prices plummeted from their peaks. The factors contributing to this drastic volatility are roughly:</p>
<p>(1) Due to the price controls of the past two months, there was pent-up demand once they were lifted. People were optimistic, and prices rose like wild horses released from their reins. The price increases had exceeded both production costs and the amount of currency issued. Therefore, when people calmed down, this blind rising trend immediately subsided.</p>
<p>(2) The Huaihai Campaign between the Nationalists and Communists had already begun. The location of Xuzhou and Bengbu, bordering Nanjing and Shanghai, differed greatly from previous anti-communist wars. Therefore, military developments had a particularly significant impact on the economy.</p>
<p>(3) As commodity prices rose sharply by several times to several tens of times in a short period, there was insufficient currency in circulation, a shortage of chips, and extremely tight credit. Shadow interest rates soared, reaching a new record of four or five yuan. As a result, merchants had to sell their goods for cash to cope with this unprecedented credit crunch.</p>
<p>(4) This round of price increases was led by the shortage and frantic bidding for rice. The controlled price for top-grade white rice was 21 yuan per picul. Compared to last week's bidding prices, which ranged from 500 to over 1,000 yuan, this represented an increase of 30 to 50 times, greatly impacting sentiment. Subsequently, the authorities actively worked to secure rice supplies, placing orders from abroad and airlifting rice from Jiangxi. They made every effort to maintain the transportation and sales of rice. As a result, the rice market gradually opened up. By the weekend, most rice shops had top-grade white rice available for around 500 yuan per picul, which calmed people's hearts and moderated the general price increases.</p>
<p>Given the aforementioned factors, in the commodity market, cotton yarn reached a new high of 14,000 yuan per bale for 42-count Blue Phoenix yarn when the market opened early in the week, closing at 13,000 yuan. It then gradually fell sharply, reaching 8,500 yuan by Thursday. 21-count Double Horse yarn fell from 7,000-8,000 yuan at the beginning of the week to 5,200 yuan by Thursday. It rebounded slightly over the weekend due to purchases from outside the local market.</p>
<p>Dragon Head fine cloth was 380 yuan at the beginning of the week. On Tuesday, there were frequent ups and downs, falling from 430 yuan to 260 yuan, eventually closing at 300 yuan, settling at 310 yuan at the end of the week.</p>
<p>In terms of food, the bidding for rice was most chaotic at the beginning of the week, with prices ranging from several hundred to over a thousand yuan. After the third day, normal transactions gradually opened up. Top-grade white rice was around 700 yuan per picul, eventually falling to 500 yuan by the end of the week. Bidding for oil and flour was also inconsistent, with raw oil fluctuating between 1,000 and 1,500 yuan, and flour between 100 and over 200 yuan.</p>
<p>The prices of daily necessities uniformly declined from their peaks. Gu Ben soap gradually fell from 400 yuan at the beginning of the week to 300 yuan at the end of the week. Ten small Great Britain matches gradually fell from 104 yuan at the beginning of the week to 70 yuan at the end of the week.</p>
<p>Since the promulgation of the Emergency Decree for Financial and Economic Affairs, the "Gold Yuan Issuance Regulations" and the "Regulations for the Handling of Gold, Silver, and Foreign Currency Owned by the People," which had been in effect for less than three months, were replaced last week by new "Revised Gold Yuan Issuance Regulations" and "Revised Regulations for the Handling of Gold, Silver, and Foreign Currency Owned by the People" passed by the Executive Yuan. According to the revised regulations, significant changes include:</p>
<p>(1) The people are permitted to hold gold, silver, and foreign currency, but the circulation and buying/selling are prohibited except for silver coins.</p>
<p>(2) The exchange rate between the Gold Yuan and gold, silver, and foreign currency has been revised to 1,000 yuan per tael of gold, 20 yuan per US dollar, 15 yuan per tael of silver, and 10 yuan per silver coin.</p>
<p>(3) The total amount of Gold Yuan issued, previously rigidly set at 2 billion, is now revised to "The total amount of Gold Yuan issued shall be determined by order separately." In other words, there is no longer a limit to the maximum amount of Gold Yuan that can be issued in the future.</p>
<p>(4) It has been decided to mint Gold Yuan coins, with each coin containing 4.4434 grams of gold.</p>
<p>(5) Anyone holding Gold Yuan coins or Gold Yuan banknotes may purchase foreign exchange in accordance with the government's regulations on foreign exchange management. Anyone depositing Gold Yuan banknotes in a bank designated by the Central Bank for a term of one year, in addition to receiving interest as stipulated, may also exchange the same amount of Gold Yuan banknotes for Gold Yuan coins at the time of deposit. Before the Gold Yuan coins are minted, they may be exchanged for gold or silver coins at the prescribed ratio.</p>
<p>In short, this revision of the regulations has, in spirit, completely dragged the Gold Yuan back to the situation of the old legal tender era. How to stabilize future prices, we still have to find a fundamental solution.</p>
<p>Currency and Finance</p>
<h3 id="e92">Tight Credit, High Shadow Interest Rates, Financial Institutions in Dire Straits, Impact of Foreign Exchange Rate Changes on Overseas Remittances and Exports Uncertain <a href="#e92" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c92" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">92</a></h3>
<p>Last week, the tight credit situation in this city intensified, reaching an unprecedentedly severe level. The reasons for this are roughly:</p>
<p>(1) The war situation is critical, rumors are rampant, and floating capital is fleeing south, reaching tens of millions of yuan per day. Floating capital coming to Shanghai from the north is immediately transferred south, depleting the city's funds.</p>
<p>(2) Amid public panic, prices change several times a day, and there is often a price but no goods. Those who hoard goods hold on to their materials, making the need for funds urgent. Those who possess funds exchange them for materials, and some move their funds to the suburbs for purchases, further depleting the funds in the city.</p>
<p>(3) The issuance of Gold Yuan is rapidly approaching 2 billion, about ten times the amount of legal tender issued. However, the prices of various commodities compared to the "August 19th" controlled prices have exceeded ten times, and some have even exceeded forty times. Comparing the amount of currency with the prices of goods, the working capital feels short.</p>
<p>(4) As a result of soaring prices and high shadow interest rates, deposits in financial institutions are fleeing en masse. To protect themselves, financial institutions have decided to gradually tighten lending to customers and accelerate the recovery of outstanding debts. They are also restricting withdrawals to cope with the severe shortage of banknotes. This naturally creates additional pressure on the tight credit situation. The credit situation in this city has played out an unprecedentedly tight scene under the impact of these stormy waves.</p>
<p>On Thursday morning, the tight credit situation reached its peak. For example, shadow interest rates had already risen from 90 cents to 1.5 yuan on Monday, creating an unprecedented record. But on Tuesday, shadow interest rates reached a new peak, rising to 3 yuan, which means borrowing 1,000 yuan requires a cost of 30 yuan per day. This is truly shocking. On Wednesday, shadow interest rates remained at a high price of 2.4 to 3 yuan. On Thursday morning, credit was extremely tight, and shadow interest rates rose like wild horses, reaching a peak of 6 yuan. This can truly be described as a usurious loan that shook both China and foreign countries and was unprecedented. The severity of the overall situation can be seen from this. Fortunately, after noon on Thursday, a large amount of remittances from other ports arrived, relieving the credit crunch. Shadow interest rates also plummeted to 1.4 yuan, returning to Monday's level, giving the extremely tense financial market a breather.</p>
<p>Another measure of the tight credit situation is the sharp increase in bounced checks. On Wednesday, one in every fifteen checks bounced on average. On Tuesday, financial institutions' statistics showed that bounced checks accounted for one-half of the total amount of checks received and paid. On Thursday, one in every eight checks bounced on average. Times of chaos reveal people's hearts. In times of crisis, commercial credit is also greatly discounted!</p>
<p>In such a period, the situation of commercial financial institutions is indeed too precarious. The escape of deposits and the widespread shortage of orders have become commonplace within the industry. But talking about recovering outstanding principal and interest is easier said than done. Silver and money businesses can only rely on raising listed interest rates to comfort themselves. Last week, listed interest rates were raised twice. The first time was on Monday, with deposit interest rising from 6% to 9%, outstanding interest rising from 18% to 27%, and interbank lending interest rising from 15% to 22.5%. The second time was scheduled to begin on Friday, with deposit interest rising to 13.5% and outstanding interest rising to 39%. But compared to the market interest rate after the increase, there is still a difference of about ten times. Obviously, it is futile for financial institutions to rely on this method to restore their business!</p>
<p>Last week, the exchange rate remained unchanged. The main change in the foreign exchange market was the Executive Yuan's passage on Thursday of the revised Gold Yuan issuance regulations and the revised regulations for the handling of gold, silver, and foreign currency owned by the people. According to this method, the people seem to be able to hold gold, silver, and foreign currency again. The regulations also changed the ratio of gold, silver, and foreign currency to Gold Yuan, calculating gold at 1,000 Gold Yuan per tael, US dollars at 20 Gold Yuan per dollar, and silver coins at 10 Gold Yuan per dollar. Among them, except for silver dollars, free circulation and trading are still prohibited. In addition, the authorities announced that they will start minting gold coins, and those whose Gold Yuan banknotes are stored for a full year will be exchanged for these gold coins according to the legal price. This is naturally a kind of "forward check." As to whether the authorities can use this method to shrink the rampant Gold Yuan, it still depends on the government's past credibility with the people.</p>
<p>As for whether export trade and overseas remittances will increase as a result, it depends on whether the black market price exists. In order to increase the foreign exchange income from overseas remittances and export trade, in the large environment of currency inflation, the gradual adjustment of the legal price of gold, silver, and foreign exchange may become necessary again. Although this is the old road of the legal tender era, what is different is that the middle class has now been rectified, and the other conditions for increasing overseas remittances or export trade have also undergone changes in nature. Therefore, it is obviously impossible to be optimistic about simply relying on the continuous changes in the foreign exchange rate to stimulate overseas remittances or promote exports.</p>
<h3 id="e93">Regulations on the Handling of Uncertified Imported Goods <a href="#e93" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c93" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">93</a></h3>
<p>The Executive Yuan has announced and implemented the Regulations on Applications for the Withdrawal and Handling of Foreign Orders for Which Payment Has Been Made. The above regulations apply to all uncertified goods arriving at the port and goods shipped, which were previously stipulated to be re-exported or confiscated. The Import Control Commission, China Trust Bureau, Jianghai Customs, etc., recently held a joint meeting to discuss specific methods. Three measures were decided upon and announced by the Import Control Commission yesterday. The following are the regulations:</p>
<p>(1) Goods arriving at the port and goods shipped without a certificate before September 30, 1947, that should be compulsorily purchased by the government are not subject to the provisions of this handling method.</p>
<p>(2) Regarding the guidelines for handling cases that should be ordered to be re-exported or confiscated: (A) Goods arriving at the port and goods shipped without a certificate before September 30, 1947, that should be ordered to be re-exported or confiscated but have not yet been disposed of, may be handled in accordance with the provisions of this method. (B) Goods arriving at the port and goods shipped without a certificate from October 1, 1947, to November 20, may be re-exported within the prescribed time or may apply for import in accordance with this method. (C) Goods arriving at the port and goods shipped without a certificate after November 21, 1947, that should be confiscated but have not yet been disposed of, may be handled in accordance with this method.</p>
<p>(3) Interpretation of disposal: (A) In the case of confiscation, the customs' execution of confiscation and settlement shall prevail. (B) In the case of purchased goods, the China Trust Bureau's issuance of a purchase certificate shall prevail. (C) For re-exported goods, the actual declaration of export shall prevail.</p>
<h3 id="e94">Examination and Payment of Foreign Exchange and Foreign Exchange, Import Control Commission Must Complete Within Seven Days <a href="#e94" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c94" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">94</a></h3>
<p>The Import Control Commission has received 29 requests for the Central Bank's foreign currency and foreign exchange payment methods. The Import Control Commission is accelerating the review of these applications. Director Huo entrusted that in order to import raw materials that cannot be produced domestically as soon as possible to regulate domestic industrial needs, it is specifically stipulated that they must be completed within seven days from the date of acceptance of the application. Therefore, more than ten applications can be approved this week. However, applications for import annex industrial raw materials are not accepted for the time being because the Executive Yuan has not yet approved the payment amount.</p>
<h3 id="e95">New Measures for Managing Financial Institutions, Ministry of Finance Submits to Executive Yuan for Approval <a href="#e95" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c95" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">95</a></h3>
<p>After the revision and implementation of the Gold Yuan issuance regulations and the gold, silver, and foreign currency handling regulations, financial people are paying much attention to whether the management of financial institutions in the future will be changed in accordance with the new regulations. According to relevant sources: In the future, the management of financial institutions will still be handled in accordance with the previously established methods in principle. However, its use of funds will be aimed at assisting the development of production and public utilities to eliminate the act of using funds for illegal speculation. As for the interest rate part, the Banking Association will draft a daily rate and submit it to the Central Bank for approval. It is heard that the above measures are being requested by the Ministry of Finance from the Executive Yuan, and will be implemented as soon as they are approved.</p>
<h3 id="e96">Great Victory Begins in Xuzhou <a href="#e96" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c96" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">96</a></h3>
<p>— Special Correspondent of This Newspaper, Fang Canglang</p>
<p>[Pukou News, 11th] The good news of the great victory of the Nationalist army on the east and west wings of Xuzhou on the 10th, especially the captivating subtitle "Foundation for Victory of Xuzhou Campaign Laid," excited millions of troubled people along the Jinpu southern section and instantly made several refugees who had been crying all day for not being able to buy train tickets laugh.</p>
<p>Million Soldiers Use Their Lives on the Cross-Shaped Position</p>
<p>The reason for the victory of the Xuzhou Campaign was sown long ago before the evacuation of Zhengzhou and Kaifeng and the retreat from Yantai. Under the wise decision of President Chiang, the Nationalist Command resolutely changed its strategy, strove for the initiative, and temporarily unloaded the two big burdens that could have burdened the safety of Xuzhou and Xinyang. After withdrawing from Kaifeng and Zhengzhou, it took extremely clever actions to build a cross-shaped position with Xuzhou as the core. People with a little modern military common sense have already seen that this major strategic change shows that the government has chosen a timely and appropriate anti-communist strategy. It can not only rely on to ensure Xuzhou, but also steadily on the cross-shaped position that spans hundreds of miles with Xuzhou as the core, ring the death knell for Chen Yi, who is arrogant and self-satisfied, and Liu Bocheng, who compares himself to "Eastern Xiaboyang." This is by no means an exaggeration. The composition of this cross-shaped position under Jiuli Mountain does have three favorable factors. (1) The morale is calm and the morale is high. The cadres and soldiers of Huang Baitao, Qiu Qingquan, Feng Zhi'an, and Sun Yuanliang, such as Confucian General Huang Baitao, Rao General Qiu Qingquan, and Veteran Anti-Japanese Generals Feng Zhi'an and Sun Yuanliang, have rich and tenacious experience in suppressing bandits. The strength of these large corps has an overwhelming advantage in terms of quantity and quality. (2) The command is flexible and the cooperation is appropriate. Huang, Qiu, Sun, Feng and other troops are well-equipped, able to defend steadily, attack fortifications, and are accustomed to mobile warfare. In addition, the length and width of the defense line are appropriate, and the terrain is conducive to the Nationalist army, which is easy to command and easy to echo. In addition, the flexible use of the indestructible armored corps makes it impossible for the bandit army to use the strategy and tactics of "using the big to eat the small." (3) Air Force Assistance Because large and small bases are close at hand, supplies and transportation are convenient everywhere and become more effective. In addition, it is mostly sunny in early winter. The terrain in the border area of Jiangsu, Shandong, Henan, and Anhui is easier to identify at this time and place. Because there are few dense forests and dense jungles, the bandit army's positions are easy to expose, and the power of the Iron Crow is enough to chill the bandit's courage. The left coupon for the victory of the Xuzhou Campaign has been manipulated by the Nationalist army. The Nationalist army's strategy of exchanging space for time has obviously achieved remarkable success.</p>
<p>Yuanliang Shows His Power in Northern Anhui</p>
<p>Exchanging space for time and accumulating small victories into big victories are two famous sayings that General Bai Jiansheng, the commander of anti-communist operations in Central China, often mentioned when he spoke to reporters about the anti-Japanese strategy before the Taierzhuang Victory in the early summer of 1938. This great victory in the Xuzhou Campaign was not a fluke. In order to pre-plan to cut off the pincer offensive of the Chen and Liu bandits, gain a firm grasp of the southern section of the Jinpu Railway, and strengthen the defense of the periphery of Xuzhou, the Nationalist army first benefited from Sun Yuanliang's corps, which successively captured Fuyang, Mengcheng, Woyang, and Sixian in one week, and recovered dozens of important strongholds along the banks of the Wo River, showing its power in northern Anhui. Continuing on the 8th and 9th, General Qiu Qingquan of the Nationalist army used the power of thunder to defeat the 9th Column, 1st Division, one brigade of the 4th Column, two regiments of the Liangguang Column, and two regiments of the 3rd, 8th Column, which were sent to their deaths by Chen Geng's bandit troops from western Henan, on the line of Huangkou (90 miles from Xuzhou) and Dangshan (150 miles from Xuzhou) on the west wing of Xuzhou. At the same time, Huang Baitao's corps also gave a dismount to the 2nd, 4th, 6th, 11th, 12th, 13th, and New 7th Columns of the Chen bandits on the line from Yunhezhan (150 miles from Xuzhou) to Nianzhuang, killing and wounding more than 10,000 bandit troops. In today's view, this is just a small victory, but the morale of the Nationalist army has been greatly boosted. The high fighting spirit of the Nationalist army on the east and west wings is only seen in the past anti-communist battles. It is reported that Chen Yi personally supervised the battle near Yunhezhan before the 8th and executed a regimental commander who was ineffective in combat. That night, he moved his headquarters back to a small village in the Taizhao branch line.</p>
<h3 id="e97">Baitao Wins Every Battle, Lucky General Works Day and Night <a href="#e97" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c97" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">97</a></h3>
<p>According to reliable intelligence, it is estimated that Chen, who invaded Jinan this time, was complacent, thinking about claiming credit, and underestimated the strength of the Nationalist army in the core of Xuzhou and its periphery. He blindly tilted about 15 columns of the bandit troops in central Shandong and western and southern Shandong, and then combined Chen Geng, Liu Bocheng, Zhang Guangzhong and other bandits with more than ten columns, and the so-called "militia." The total number of troops in the first Qianbing was about 300,000 or more, and he was satisfied that he could defeat the Nationalist army Huang Corps on the east wing of the periphery of Xuzhou, and then directly attack the side and back of Xuzhou and lightly take Pengcheng. Unexpectedly, in the three days of the 10th, 11th and 12th, he suffered another defeat on the line of Nianzhuang and Bayiji on the east road of Longhai, with as many as 37,000 bandit troops killed and wounded. The main force of its elite 1st, 2nd, 7th, and 9th Columns has lost more than half, and its spirit has been greatly frustrated. On the Nationalist army side, although General Huang Baitao, who has won every battle, suffered casualties, it was only four or five thousand people. The value of this hard battle is comparable to the victory in eastern Henan this year. Therefore, when the news of victory reached Pengcheng, General Liu Jingfu, who was responsible for the safety of Xuzhou, immediately reported the victory to the Supreme Commander President Chiang in an excited and pleasant tone. At the same time, he immediately ordered the officers and soldiers of General Huang Baitao's troops to be commended and greatly encouraged, so that they could continue to make efforts and give Chen's bandits a greater blow to complete the sacred mission of defending the Greater Xuzhou. On the day when the good news of the victory on the east and west wings of Xuzhou was frequently reported (11th), General Bai Jiansheng flew to Xuzhou from Hankou to personally instruct the generals on the plan to eliminate the bandits. General Bai's confidence in the victory of the Xuzhou Campaign may be reflected in more brilliant and great battles in the next few days. Lucky General Liu Zhi is said to have worked day and night for as long as five days and nights. Now, because the war situation has turned for the better and the economy has stabilized, everyone on the front line and in the rear is thinking for the better. However, everyone should have a deep understanding of the hard work of the soldiers on the front line, and should do everything possible to launch a widespread movement to comfort the army in order to welcome the great achievements that turn the world around and reduce the infinitely painful bandit disaster. Here, the reporter can incidentally report to the readers that the real victory of the anti-communist military has begun in Xuzhou today. This can be seen from the good news that the closer the war is to the front line, the lower the prices are and the more stable people's hearts are. The price of rice in Xuzhou has fallen to 130 yuan per picul, pork is less than 10 yuan per catty, and daily necessities are also quite cheap. The merchants on the front line have already taken out their conscience.</p>

<p>[News from Chengdu, 10th] An unprecedented large-scale armed fight recently occurred in Maoxian County, Western Sichuan. Da Er Mao Niu (Yi chieftain's name) in the Heishui Yi area of the county have historically been in conflict due to power struggles. Recently, Gongyang Gaoping, a bigwig in the area, provoked discord between the two tribes and encouraged Da Mao Niu to encroach on Er Mao Niu's territory. Li Yinggang of Er Mao Niu led more than 2,000 Yi people to attack Da Mao Niu and Gongyang Gaoping last month. However, Da Mao Niu used a beauty trap, selecting more than 200 beautiful Yi women to dance the ge guozhuang (Yi dance) in nearby villages to lure the enemy. When Li's cavalry rushed to a point where they were panting and their attention shifted, they used cannons and machine guns to sweep them, causing heavy casualties to Li's troops. Currently, the two sides have thousands of troops and horses facing each other, forming the first large-scale city fight in the border area in a century.</p>

<p>[News from Nanchang, 12th] This year, due to the two floods of peach and grass, the water level of rivers and lakes in Jiangxi Province rose sharply. A total of 277 embankment breaches and collapses occurred along the rivers and lakes. Many embankments that were not breached were also eroded by wind and waves, causing many collapses. According to estimates by the Water Conservancy Bureau: the amount of earthwork urgently needed for emergency repairs is 2,125,152 cubic meters, and the amount of earthwork for secondary repairs is 1,276,389 cubic meters, totaling 14,560,673 cubic meters. A flood embankment restoration plan has now been formulated. The central government will allocate funds to handle it, and it is expected that construction will start during the winter agricultural gap this year and will be completed in early spring next year to prevent the spring flood.</p>

<p>— Xu Chengyu</p>
<p>Returning home to a mountain dwelling overgrown with weeds,</p>
<p>Every day, rumors spread of soaring rice prices,</p>
<p>Sighing, I still bend to the burden of five dou of grain,</p>
<p>Dishes and goblets have long been neglected, collecting dust.</p>
<p>The people are starving and drowning amidst warfare,</p>
<p>What are my thoughts when I gaze at the world with sorrow?</p>
<p>After cleaning a room, I still stand with my hands clasped behind my back,</p>
<p>How can I bear to chant poems in the wind and rain?</p>
<p>I do not believe that the scenery surpasses that of Yongjia,</p>
<p>Empty words and laughter speak of pacifying the Tartar sands,</p>
<p>To whom do Mao Hong and An Shi belong now?</p>
<p>Sitting here, it is hard to quell the clamor of the world.</p>
<p>Shutting my door, my heart is still uneasy,</p>
<p>In these perilous times, the flowers and bamboo evoke endless feelings.</p>
<p>My children do not understand, spoiling the spring view,</p>
<p>I will lean against the orchids in the desolate courtyard for now.</p>

<p>— Yi Jun</p>
<p>The work of a teacher is arduous enough. Take me, for example: I teach two classes of Chinese, serve as a homeroom teacher for one class, and manage the library. My regular weekly workload includes teaching twelve class periods, grading one hundred and nine composition notebooks, one hundred and nine notebook assignments, sixty-three weekly journals, reviewing one hundred and twenty-six pages of large calligraphy, and one hundred and twenty-six pages of small calligraphy. In addition, there are library and student affairs matters to attend to. With so much to do, from dawn till dusk, besides waiting for and squeezing onto buses, all my time is spent either shouting in the classroom or writing non-stop in the workroom (even Sundays are busy). Shouting in the classroom is not like performing a play on stage to earn the audience's applause, and writing non-stop in the workroom is not as enjoyable as reading novels or writing articles. Especially when grading student writing, I become dizzy and my back and arms ache because their writing is not like the novels of Mao Dun or Ba Jin, not like the plays of Cao Yu or Tian Han, not like the selected works of Lu Xun or Guo Moruo, not like the new poems of Ai Qing or Zang Kejia. What is it then? Mostly muddled accounts, unclear and chaotic, "like drumming on a high mountain, no connection, no connection," immature works, filled with misspelled and misused characters, as if everyone aspires to reform Chinese characters.</p>
<p>Although my work is so arduous, I find it difficult, but not depressing (even taking it in stride). My depression does not lie here; perhaps it can be said that the depression of private school teachers does not lie here.</p>
<p>Our depression stems from livelihood issues, namely salary problems. Speaking of our salaries, at the beginning of the semester, it is considered relatively good. Again, take me as an example: my monthly salary is 104 Gold Yuan, which is 10 or 20 yuan higher than that of ordinary public school teachers, and it is paid out in one lump sum for five months. Less than a month after payment, seeing that the situation is not right, the salary for the last month is also paid out in full. Therefore, friends say that my treatment is "very good," and I myself feel that it seems not bad. However, now that price limits have been lifted, prices are rising for everything, and the rise is very rapid. As far as I know, train fares have increased fivefold, a regular letter has increased twentyfold, shoe shining has increased from one jiao to three jiao, and pancakes have increased from 100,000 to 600,000. The daily food allowance for our school teachers has been forced to increase from 2 yuan to 6 yuan. Even the salaries of public school teachers, which are the most difficult to raise, have increased by one and a half times. Only we, private school teachers, watch helplessly as prices rise and others receive pay raises, while we cannot get another cent. The money we received earlier has already become part of others' "endless treasures"; how can life not be a problem, and how can we not be depressed?</p>
<p>Perhaps someone will say: "If your salaries were not paid out in one lump sum, but paid monthly, how could you have gotten into this situation?"</p>
<p>Sir, your words have not been carefully considered. If it were paid monthly, at this time, compared to public school teachers, when they increase by one and a half times, we would be equivalent to decreasing by one and a half times; compared to train fares, when they increase fivefold, we would be equivalent to decreasing fivefold; compared to pancakes, when they increase sixfold, we would be equivalent to decreasing sixfold; compared to a letter, when they increase twentyfold, we would be equivalent to decreasing twentyfold. This is only in terms of this month or this ten-day period. I am afraid that as time goes on, our salary will be equivalent to decreasing to zero. How can we pay it out monthly?</p>
<p>And in fact, some private schools do pay monthly but do not adjust monthly, which is even more miserable.</p>
<p>Our work, although hard, is not depressing, but our lives have become so hard that we are on the verge of suffocation.</p>
<h3 id="e108">In a Fourth-Rate Movie Theater <a href="#e108" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c108" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">108</a></h3>
<p>— Jingwen</p>
<p>At this time when everyone is worried about firewood and rice, I actually have the interest to lead a few children to see a movie in a fourth-rate movie theater near my residence on a holiday. It can really be said that I am "unaware" of the living environment or that my psychological state has become numb. Moreover, the remaining money on hand is only enough to buy a pound of biscuits, and the "food" for the next few days is nowhere to be found. Such "recreation" is no different from what the idiom says, "playing the qin under a Coptis chinensis tree."</p>
<p>But our stomachs were temporarily filled with red rice and green vegetables, and the children at home were restless. Their young hearts had no fear or worry, and they knew that "Dad got paid yesterday," so they could not avoid this small exploitation. Moreover, sitting bored at home would only consume more cigarettes, which would be enough to cover the price of tickets at a fourth-rate movie theater.</p>
<p>The fact proves that it is not only me who is suffering from numbness in life. Both movie theaters I went to were already full (even though there was still more than half an hour before the show). The crowd outside was still huge, a scene of complete prosperity. Finally, I managed to buy tickets at the third place, and even more fortunately, I actually found seats. Within five minutes, not only were all the seats occupied, but the steps on both sides and the aisles were filled with people.</p>
<p>It turns out that this fourth-rate movie theater has never had a system of assigned seating. The theater owner only seeks to maximize profits. If a "full house" sign is hung here, it is not only because all the seats are occupied, but also because it is difficult to find a place to stand inside.</p>
<p>Looking at the audience of men, women, old, and young standing next to me and sitting on the steps, I congratulated myself on arriving early, but at the same time, I couldn't help but feel that our people are really too easy to deal with. Although the ticket price is not high, they are still paying customers, and at the very least they should be given a seat. Now, they are allowed to sit on the cold cement steps or stand against the wall, while those special audience members who do not pay for tickets sit cross-legged, turning a blind eye to the plight of the paying audience, as if it were natural.</p>
<p>Although this is a scene in a fourth-rate movie theater, and everyone is already accustomed to it, it seems to me that the reason why China, although having the opportunity to join the ranks of world powers, has always been relegated to the status of a fourth-rate country is reflected in this fourth-rate movie theater.</p>
<p>The boss only knows about money, with a mouth full of flowery words, like a mirror image on the screen, which is accessible to the eye but not to the grasp, only for your "entertainment," "entertainment." The most pitiful thing is that the paying audience does not know their due rights and are manipulated by others. Cement is cement, standing is standing, and not only dare not protest, but even rarely complain. I often hear some old ladies in the crowd leaving the theater saying, "The movie was quite good, but my legs are stiff from standing," and I can't help but smile bitterly.</p>
<p>I doubt whether the audience's patience will be endless. The theater owners only want money, and those with privileges sit high in their seats. Even if the audience has patience, I am afraid that there will be a day when they will demand a "refund." Although this is a matter in a fourth-rate movie theater, is it really just a matter of a fourth-rate movie theater?</p>

<p>— Cangyu</p>
<p>Recently, a certain laboratory in the United States invented a so-called acetate safety film. Ordinary film becomes brittle in less than twenty-five years, but this safety film, if the air around it is properly conditioned, can be preserved indefinitely.</p>
<h3 id="e110">Aftersound <a href="#e110" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c110" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">110</a></h3>
<p>— Gongsun Wu</p>
<p>Li Yu said, "In the world, for every character, there is a head, which is the initial sound; and for every character, there is a tail, which is the final sound. After the tail, there is also an aftersound, which completes the character and brings it to a conclusion. For example, for the character '蕭' (xiao), the initial sound is '西' (xi), the final sound is '夭' (yao), and the aftersound is '烏' (wu). Spelling the sound with two characters is not as good as the single character for the aftersound." He also said, "The initial sound, final sound, and aftersound are all intended for slow melodies, which must have them whether one character takes one beat or one character takes several beats; fast melodies only have the main sound and lack the initial and final sounds." Li Weng was a master of opera in the early Qing Dynasty, and he was especially skilled in judging sounds. This theory can be applied to education. I have always said that having children practice singing more songs can help them pronounce characters correctly. Children who are accustomed to using dialects should be made to sing songs in the national language often, emphasizing singing out the initial and final sounds and then drawing out the aftersound, so that the pronunciation of characters will be accurate and unchangeable. Li Weng also gave an example, saying: "The master of ceremonies replaces '拜' (bài, bow) with the two characters '不愛' (bù ài, not love), and replaces '興' (xīng, rise) with the two characters '希因' (xī yīn, hope for reason), because bowing and rising take a little longer, and the singer cannot help but lengthen the sounds of the characters." In short, teachers of writing can use this method of lengthening the sounds to make character pronunciation easier to correct.</p>
<h3 id="e111">Waste of Public Funds <a href="#e111" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c111" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">111</a></h3>
<p>— Yu Qiang</p>
<p>Various agencies, when preparing budgets, invariably have the intention of "asking for a little more." If the auditing agencies do not verify and allocate funds according to actual needs, public funds will inevitably be wasted.</p>
<p>The budget proposed by the U.S. "Veterans Administration" this year included a huge sum of $7.9 million for stationery alone. Part of this money is used to print 3,674,000,000 sheets of official paper. If it were distributed, each veteran would get 200 sheets, or each American would get 30 sheets.</p>
<p>The agency also requested to print over 303 million sheets of letterhead, costing over $550,000. With so many letterhead, allocated to all the employees of the "Veterans Administration" (including elevator operators), each person could write 1,348 letters in 1948.</p>
