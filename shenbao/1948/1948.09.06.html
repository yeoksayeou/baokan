<h3>自美搭輪赴莫斯科途中　馮玉祥父女被焚斃　船近敖德薩時失慎起火</h3>
<p>〔中央社莫斯科五日電〕馮玉祥偕其女搭蘇輪「頗畢大」號，自美來蘇，至黑海敖德糜港附近，該輪不愼失火，馮氏父女均遭焚斃。「頗畢大」號於八月初自紐約啓程，乘客多爲自美遺送歸國之蘇官員眷屬，在巴統至敖德薩途中，輪上放映影片，不慎失火，遇難者除馮氏父女外，尚有不知名者若干人。出事日期一說爲八月卅一日，一說爲九月一日。「頗畢大」號巴於昨日駛抵敖得薩港。</p>
<p>〔合衆社莫斯科五日電〕此間五日宣佈：以倒戈馳名之中國「基督將軍」馮玉祥，在蘇輪「頗月初自紐約啓椗，載送撤召回國之蘇聯官員家屬，途經開羅時，復載客二千人，該船將二千人送達勃吐米後，復於八月三十一日駛往敖德薩（黑海口岸）途中以處理電影膠片不愼失火，馮玉祥及其女以及若干不知名之乘客被焚斃，該船則已於四日被拖至敖德薩。</p>
<p>〔本報南京五日電〕據悉：隨馮玉祥同船赴美者爲馮之第二女理達，馮妻李德全是否亦在內，尚不得知。此間馮之友人政府某要員於獲悉馮被焚斃後，深訝何以李德全未在其內，因據渠所知，馮之「轉變」，受李之影響最大也。</p>
<p>馮氏略歷</p>
<p>馮玉祥字煥章，原籍安徽巢縣，遜淸光緒七年（公曆一八八一年）生於河北保定。弱冠入北洋武備學校，未二年輟學，投武衛右軍，任第九鎭隊長，後被選送入保定軍官學校肄業。宣統二年，任第三鎭營長，駐直隸（即河北省）境內旋編入禁衛軍。民國以後，馮部改編爲第十六混成旅，民國八年直皖之役，曾佐吳佩孚，由吳推薦會辦陝西軍務，所部亦改編爲第十一師。民國十三年，率師回京（今之北平），到吳敗曹（錕），擁段祺瑞就任臨時執政。其後又有倒段之舉。十五年一月，聲明下野，經庫倫入俄，遊歷半載。十六年回國加入國民革命軍，十七年，國民政府改組，被任國府委員，行政院副院長兼軍政部長，十九年二月，聯閻三度變節，成爲著名的一倒戈將軍」。二十年，九一八事件發生，國內領袖團結一致，抵抗日本，馮又返抵南京，復任軍委會常委，一度因病，登泰山休養。夫人李德全，河北通縣人，夫婦皆爲基督徒因又得「基督將軍」之稱。抗戰勝利後，於卅五年四月閒假考察水利名義，出國赴美，在美國時常發表攻擊政府之言論，號與匿於香港之民盟份子及叛黨李濟琛等勾結，沆瀣一氣，今年一月七日，中國國民黨中常會通過開除馮之黨籍。但馮仍不悔悟。日事喧囂，應李濟琛等之邀，於八月下旬離美經歐返國，在黑海蘇聯航輪中罹難，享年六十七歲。</p>
<h3>陶啟明供出重要綫索　徐百齊指使拋空　警廳今日將予拘捕偵訊</h3>
<p>〔本報南京五日電〕在軟禁中之財部主任秘書徐百齊，五日已因陶啓明之供詞證實有洩漏消息之嫌，拋售永紗案，至此已步入一新階段。陶供詞中並表示渠之拋售行爲係被動，亦卽說明渠係接受指使而爲。陶供詞中除指出徐百齊之行爲而外，同時並指出其他同被指使之關係人員，警廳已派員於五日晚乘夜車赴滬，將會同滬市當局迅卽逮捕此關係人員。據辦理該案之監委唐鴻烈，孫玉琳兩氏就此談稱；在對徐百齊之訊問未能完畢前，吾人不能確定該案應追究之成分是否至徐爲止，因徐之洩漏消息及指使陶之行爲，是否將有其他幕後問題，不能確定。五日監委對陶啓明訊問時間多達七小時，運用各種方式，以取得陶之供詞。就法律觀點言，陶如確屬被動，則罪刑較輕，如就政治觀點言，其罪行將較重。如徐百齊行爲確如陶所供者相符，則其罪刑當更重，因渠乃利用職務，指使他人有所作爲而投機牟利者。至監院對此案之態度，據孫氏稱：須俟全案偵訊完畢後，除司法部份送交司法機關辦理外，其餘則待其全部報告整理完竣，再研究執行監察權之對象及職權之分別，惟因時間關係，目前尚不能決定。</p>
<p>〔本報南京五日電〕陶啓明案賺疑犯，被軟禁已三日之財部主任秘書徐百齊，將於六日決定其被拘捕受偵訊之命運。徐於五日仍被軟禁於財部部長辦公廳三樓，刑警隊員多人看守，並禁止徐與外人見面，徐之神情似頗凄惻，警　原定五日進行拘捕徐百齊，以作進一步之偵訊，惟截至晚十一時止，警廳黃廳長未能與財長王雲五會見，故拘捕手續尚未進行，俟六日黃與王部長接洽後，即可決定拘捕之手續。等候處理該案向徐百齊執行訊問之監委唐鴻烈·孫玉琳·五日亦守至十一時，以未獲結果，始放棄五日訊問之工作，惟在原則上則己決定拘徐之手續。</p>
<h3>我國改革幣制係正確之步驟</h3>
<p>華盛頓官員之批評</p>
<p>〔合衆社社紐約四日電〕「經濟周報」四日載文稱：華府官員認爲中國之幣制改革，係「走向正確方向之步驟」。若干美國財政專家認爲，新金圓及經濟援外總署之協助，將能大事遏止中國的通貨膨脹。該雜誌繼稱：「華府方面之觀感，並非基於單方面之幣制改革計劃。遏止通貨膨脹之成就，尚有賴於預算之平衡。此點將包括。第一，稅收之改革；第二，政府之經濟；第三，軍費之减削」。</p>

<p>〔中央社南京五日電〕據甫參與韓國政府成立典禮歸來之國民外交協會理奉潘朝英談：此次本人在韓勾留時日不久，對韓國一般情勢　有下列兩點觀察：（一）韓國問題似與中國問題有相邁關係，蓋如韓國將來戰事一旦爆發，其命運或將與中國目前情形相似。（二）韓國將來命運之決定性，可能演變成以下兩種趨勢：一為美軍是否會立即韓國領土，一爲韓共是否能在韓國佔有優勢地</p>
<h3>我駐仰光總領事許紹昌調駐漢城</h3>
<p>〔本報南京五日電〕我國前駐漢城總領事劉馭萬，經升任爲大使銜駐韓外交代表後，遺缺業經外部調派前駐仰光練領事許紹昌繼任，仰光總領館事務，則併歸駐緬大使館辦理，俾符節約原則。</p>

<h3>張羣遊奈良名勝　與美司令施溫有所商談　華府預料我將促早締對日和</h3>

<p>社論</p>
<h3>忠愛國家與愛護青年　——追懷張季鸞先生——</h3>
<p>新聞界先進張季　先生以民國三十年九月六日病故於戰都重慶，今日爲其七週年祭紀念之辰。季　先生從事新聞事　三十年，以南董之直筆，作社會之導師。豈僅文章傳世，實亦眞格不朽。所以于右托先生當先生之歿，稱其卅年之奮鬥，「對國家有大貢獻，對時代有大影響，」當時輿論亦不億以「一代報人」推重他。本報以新聞老同業的立場，對先生自應有特殊的景仰，而記者茲更願以國民喉舌的地位，略爲闡述嘉言懿行，期供同胞的矜式。世亂本已，痛哲人之不作；國運猶棘，知靈爽之未昧。永懷先生，尤願言論界之珍愛使命愼爾發言也。</p>
<p>張先生早年曾從政幕，而一生實與報業相終始。他雖因創始大公報主其筆政十五年之久，但其前期在中華新報的言論，對中年人同有卓特不磨的印象，並且也曾與民立報民信報有淵源。又雖一生事業寄託在於辦報，而且守住一個報社十餘年，然其精神人格所貫注却在於我整個國家與民族。怎樣復興中國，怎樣保全中國領土主權，維護中華文化中的優美傳統，——消極方面即怎樣盡力排除侵害我獨立自由平等的侵略力量，可說是他一生奮鬥的總目標。而在他奮筆宣舌倡導國民以雪恥自强之中，他特別寄期望於靑年，——因爲靑年是我們民族新生的力量，是英練有爲的國民。在他的峻拔而明快千言萬語的「社論」中，充滿他粹然愛國家愛民族的忠忱，同時更油然流露他愛護靑年誘導後起的熱腸。愛靑年爲的是愛國家，信愛國家所賴有爲國效力的靑年；兩義一貫，可說是先生一生立言行事的中心。這是我們紀念先生所要深知而繼承發揚的。</p>
<p>愛國家一詞似乎很平凡，尤其是近代中國受外侮太深，這一個意義早深入人心，也已成新聞界立論的一種圭果。然平凡中的至理，要在信之篤而行之眞。季　先生是篤信愛國，眞切愛國，老成憂國，而且歷變不渝垂老彌篤的效忠盡愛於我中國。他的老友吳達銓氏常說：「他人亦憂國愛國，惟季鶯是眞愛國，從心底深處寢饋不忘以憂國」。他很早就體弱多病，而不改熬夜寫文，一若國家在呼召他；抗戰中他華老播遷，帶病往來渝港，可說自信戰時中國少不了他；他臨死還殷殷問當時日美談判事，而神志　然有英勇之色，又似乎有國家的靈魂憑讓了他。因此，他雖絕意仕進，無意從政，而息息注意政治，念念關心國運。也因此，他只一度參加同盟會而以後就不黨，但十分同情革命與統一的完成，因爲這是中國獨立目强的前提。北伐未成，則剴切有「國民革命可成而不可敗，應大家共勉」之言；九一八以後，立論一貫以自强雪恥爲中心。日本侵略野心日烈，利於中國之不統一，他又有「以國民共力擁護統一局面」的讜論。抗戰期中，大公報發言所以獲多士的景從，爲國民之明燈，受友邦的重視，就是張先生橡筆力張「國家主權」「抗戰到底」和國家至上國防第一的大義，最爲透澈，最爲堅定，而且言之虎虎有生氣，這一股貫日月的愛國精誠所致。</p>
<p>當二十九年冬，張先生早已到了後方，上海的同業還勉力據持抗戰的言論堡壘，張先生有萬言長文自渝寄投正言報，（三十年該報元旦特刊）眞是一篇宣明國家立塲抗戰大義的名文。他說明抗戰必勝的最大理由，是我們的目的是「絕對正義的」，——就是「絕對爭取國家民族的獨立自由與平等」，而且加以解釋。他說：「中國只有這一條大路，走熟了看淸了走，必有到底之日。甚麼是底？就是獨立自由平等。」最後他還强調「不可期待日本回頭」，以警惕留在孤島的同業和智識份子。眞所謂「大義凛然，有千鈞不拔之力。」</p>
<p>說到「國防」二字，記者却憶起一段小掌故，在今日勝利後三年來說穿了似已不妨。三十年二月杪，日寇相當猖獗，英美態度還模棱，我們第二屆的參政會將開首次會。今總統蔣公以統帥地位，例有致詞，事先約張先生詢以對應說的話的意見。他就特別陳述「國防安全」的要義，後來蔣先生致詞重來揭　當前努力的二大目標，所謂「抗戰必須爭取最後勝利，建國必須達到國防絕對安全」，着眼遠大，立言堅强，振軍民之敵　，正饑　的競　，據所傳聞，領袖詔示自有主旨，而必有騙先生的見解滲入其中。政府之重視正士，可說相得而彰，而他的愛　精神也吏得發揮而不朽了。</p>
<p>其次，我們說到張先生的愛靑年，更有說不盡的事實與名言，足以　顯他的偉大的至情與遠見。正因他熱愛國家，盡忠民族，所以愛護國家後起貞幹他所稱爲「民族少年」者，也特別眞誠，特別同擊。因爲愛靑年，就特別珍視作育靑年的敎育，他的文字常常對負作育重荷的敎師作坦率的靜言，不敎不隨，垂涕而道。大公報之所以取得敎育界好感，不是爲他迎合靑年，捧塲學者，而在於他過去特論之一貫善意的獎進靑年，尊重士流。該報當年悼先生之作，有「尤以獎掖靑年後進爲樂」，此語甚是，但要知道先生的獎掖是扶掖，是獎導，不是誇獎，讀許靑年一切反現狀的活動。張先生愛靑年尊士流是「愛人以德」，所以「忠言不避逆耳」，他是認爲「善人能受盡言」，所以正　其對貪汚與凟職之軍人政客之不憚抨擊，其對學生靑年之消沉輕浮或走入歧途亦不憚苦口婆心，醇醇誥誡；對學者敎師之立異鳴高藐視國家尤多揭示大義，口誅筆伐。這傳統，我們還是期望親炙先生願傳衣缽的作家能身體力行；雖然時代潮流不同了，我們怎忍以不敢遠拂「時趨」來術量我們的同業呢？</p>
<p>張先生的愛護靑年，善導靑年，勉靑年以立志，示靑年以鵠的，畢生不懈，死而後已。三十年夏初他己在重慶南岸休養，還有「論政治敎育」一文，（四月二十六日大公報社評）暢論對靑年施以政治敎育的方法與標準。據陳布雷氏追念之作，他曾先發其大意於陳氏，以爲「必須合力鞏固國家基礎」，已是沒有疑問的事。於此，他並不掩飾政治缺點，而切陳改善實際政治較亟於實行民主；可是他認爲提倡節概善導靑年較改革政治更爲基本之務。取法乎上，他在那時標出禮記「需行」篇所提示的爲「靑年立志做人」的標準。他認爲「靑年祗要有熱情志氣，則幼稚急躁不足爲病，惟浮薄冷酷自私，則若不加挽救，無異爲國家生命的自殘，他痛斥當時激越鳴高其實祗為自私之人之戕害靑年。他要求國家有敎「做人」敎「立志」的國民敎育，必須「有剛健不屈的人格」，而且「有建國衛國之共同意志」，必如此則中國方有眞實之繼起負荷者。字字珠璣，　蠶血淚，我們願靑年諸　能　讀斯文，我們更　大公報　新聞界同仁之本此美旨，引蘭光大，那自然不致於　見　衢，　　時代之黑暗面。至於蔡了民先生所謂「　君馬」者，潔　因先生偉大精神之復甦，而不復存在於我國今日的論壇。，綜張先生一生，忠愛於國家，眞切愛護國家的靑年。所以相反方面，他痛恨破壞國家統一的轉殊勢力，不亞於侵犯我們獨立自由的侵略力量；痛恨那　惑靑年蹂躪科學敎育的共產黨，不下於賣國求榮的漢奸。他立論在外交上是無偏的，在政治上是不黨的。可是他盡力竭誠維護國家中心，不僅在抗戰時尊重領袖，善意批評政府，並且自其辦報著文，一貫的提撕靑年不忘國家利益與建國衛國的神聖任務的。我們於此，特節引二十五年六月張先生所寫的社評，以質當世：</p>
<p>「中國今日之統一局面，乃以無量犧牲之代價換來。故惟有羣力擁護此局面，而督促其進步革新，斷不容野心者之勾煽破壞再使統一返於混亂。此無他，以中國之國力，與環境之　迫，設復混亂，將無再建統一之餘裕。」（二十五</p>
<p>那時候，殘伏的共產黨方利用一部軍人想脅持領袖遂行其陰謀，張先生的烱眼燭奸，不久而西安事變得轉禍爲福，完成中國之統一，立全面抗戰的基礎。豈料抗戰勝利，政府與國民的寬容，造成中共之坐大。如果先生今日尚在，對於出賣東北與民族利益之共匪與其所導演「學運」之如何毒害靑年，其深恨痛絕固大足傷其垂暮望治之心，其橡筆誅伐必有以大喪內賊之瞻，而深切提撕靑年之警覺，或者淸議不如今日之混淆，學潮不如今日之糜爛，而取締間諜賺疑學生之事實或許莫須有了。哲人不作，繼承非易，然我們亦有寬慰的理由，因爲領導論壇的大公報，早曾「以放言醜詆爲痛快」之「傳統錯誤」爲戒，（卅年九月七日社評）而且於言論自由與言論報國曾於先生逝後矢其　論說：「言論自由不是違法禍國害俗的自由」，而評斥政治必「根據國族利益」，而且於「傷害國家民族利益之事，必斥擊不遺餘力」的。我們深信張先生靈爽之式憑，繼承者之自愛自重，言論界亦得共仰前型，愛國家，愛靑年，有以共挽刦運以慰先生九原之靈罷。</p>

<h3>拉攏社會黨恢復合作　法國新內閣組成　許曼任總理兼執掌外交</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社巴黎五日電〕許曼昨夜澈夜與各中央黨領袖舉行會商後，今日達到組閣吿成之目的。新內閣包括人民共和黨之閣員九名，社會黨七名，激進歡會黨五名，民主社會抗爭同盟一名，獨立派一名。其名單如下：</p>
<p>總理兼外長許受（人民共和黨），副總理馬利（激進社會黨），財政經濟部長比諾（社會黨），內政部長莫許（九）社會黨），國防部長雷尼梅友（九）激進社會黨），司法部長勒古爾（人民共和黨），海外領土部長佛羅雷（人民共和黨），農業部長佛里姍林（人民共和黨），商工部長賴古斯特（社會黨），退伍兵事務及年金部長喀多亞爾（人民共和黨），保健部長許奈特（人民共和黨），公共工程部長奎伊勒（激進歡會黨），國民教育部長雷維龍（激進社會黨），復興部長柯台（獨立共和黨），宣傳部長密特朗（民主社會抗爭同盟）。</p>
<p>〔合眾社巴黎四日電〕許曼四日同意再度試行組閣，前曾加以阻撓之社會黨已在原則上同意加入內閣。社會黨於會議中以四十對二十票議定加人內閣，但許曼必須同意對其經濟計劃加以苦干修正。許曼馬利兩內閣所以垮台者，皆由於社會黨之反對。歐禮和總統之政治手腕，竟使法政治家亦感覺詫異。渠召許曼入見，並吿以在官方公在接受許氏之辭職前，渠之辭職並不合法，故在理論上許氏乃屬組閣總理。蓋總統深慮政府一旦崩潰，則不但須舉行總選，且將引起共黨與戴高樂派之全面鬥爭。許曼表示同意後，立即返外交部，並分別與三中間路綫政黨之領袖商談。</p>
<p>再則有組織的工潮，要求全面加薪，此事勢難不使舉行全國大罷工而可解決者，歐禮和之行動即此事所促成。法財部幾已　無分文，政府曾向法蘭西銀行借貸鉅款，以償付緊要賠款，法郎在黑市繼續跌價。</p>
<h3>義大利殖民地問題　將由聯大會處理　四強意見歧異恐難順利解決</h3>
<p>〔合衆社倫敦五日電〕為保持而非製造和平設立之聯合國，將於本月下旬再度從事和平任務。依據各種跡象，四强不能解決之問題，非聯大會所能解決，和平事務亦不能順利解決。本屆聯大之任務將處理義殖民地問題。以前聯大所不能解決之朝鮮與特港問題，現仍距離解決甚遠。三年來四强曾企圖尋出一解決北非義殖民地前途問題，當義和約完成時，四强決定將義殖民地問題延宕解決，並仝時將此事交與聯合國，如在一九四八年九月十五日前此問題不能擭致決議，除非四强命令將此問題決定限期延長，否則此事將自動地經由聯合國解決之，但聯大今須有三分之二多數贊成粟始能解決之，故此事是否能解決極無把握。義在北非之　民地有伊利特里亞索瑪里闌及里比亞。據悉，四强全意將索瑪里闌及伊利特里亞一部份在聯合國託管下交還義大利，伊利特里亞一部份將交與阿比西尼亞。蘇法兩國贊成將所有義殖民地在聯合監督下交還義大利。美國因競選關係，故對義殖民地問題政策較為複雜美政策必須考慮美空軍在利比亞新空軍基地之事。傳美方準備在該處設立基地，供超空堡壘之用。英國曾保證桑西斯及利比亞東部交還義方，但現亦贊成交還義大利。由於四强之意見不同，此問題在聯大中將更形複雜。</p>

<p>〔法國新聞社阿姆斯達丹四日電〕荷蘭新王裘麗娜向荷蘭與印尼人民發表演說稱：「余雖在目前困難與艱苦時期中接受王位，然並不氣餒，祖國雖遭受戰爭之破壞與蹂躪，然國際地位仍極堅强，在　國之協助下，我人必能迅速恢復，政府必將與印尼人民建立和諧之新關係，而是等新關係，又必依據於印尼人民自己之需要」。今日下午依照荷蘭傳統，女王裘麗娜偕同王室乘敞蓬軍出巡，穿五色制服之御衛軍隨行，夾道人民歡呼如雷。</p>

<h3>荷新君裘麗娜略傳</h3>
<p>荷蘭前女王威廉明娜，於九月四遜位後，即由裘麗娜女王接位執政，並定於今天（九月六日）正式登基。</p>
<p>裘麗娜女王為奧侖其納索皇室嫡系。該皇室之創始人威廉靜穆大帝在十六世紀中葉與西班牙斐列浦王作戰了八十年纔將荷蘭解放出來。</p>
<p>裘麗娜在一九〇九年四月三十日誕生於海牙王宮中。起名為裘麗娜·露薏絲·藹瑪·瑪利·威廉明娜，爵位為荷蘭公主，奧侖其，納索公主，又從其父親曼克倫堡·許惠靈親王而為曼克倫堡女公爵。這小公主於其雙親婚後八年方纔誕生，其時荷蘭人民正在恐懼女王沒有後裔，而將由其一遠族德國人來做荷蘭皇帝了。</p>
<p>裘麗娜所受家教甚嚴，但是家庭之樂亦融融洩洩。起初幾年她的教育者重於語言及各種科學方面。她也學過唱歌和小提琴，雖然她並不熱衷於運動，但是也玩玩溜冰及網球。</p>
<p>她待人和善誠摯，對其母親則極為敬愛。</p>
<p>皇室常在歐洲各地旅行。當裘麗娜達結婚的年齡時，她每次假期游歷總引起許多關於她婚事的謠言，每一個合宜男人的名字都曾被放在她的名字一起被報吿過，其中包括威爾親王在內。</p>
<p>當她十八歲時，她已達成人的年齡了，在她生日的那天，她自已的旗幟第一次在撥給她的宮上　揚。不久她就用「范勃倫小姐」的名字入萊登大學讀書。她在大學的四年是她一生中最快樂時期之一，她結交了許多朋友，並且堅特要別人直呼她為</p>
<p>在這時期中，關於她婚事的謠言，仍舊到處在傳播。但是在一九三五年左右一次冬季運動假日中，她遇到了一位年靑的德國親王，可是他的名字却從來未曾被人放在公主的名字一起過。這靑年就是列坂。皮斯德凡的朋哈德親王。</p>
<p>她們在一九三七年一月七日結了婚。月哈德親王是個很好的人，高高的個子，壯健的體魄，並且有一對漂亮的藍眼睛。愉快而勇敢，深得他岳母的歡心。在抵抗納粹軍隊的侵入時，他作戰到最後方纔逃到倫敦任威廉明娜女王的副官。</p>
<p>裘麗娜曾公開地對人民說她愛他。她們的第一個孩子璧菊麗公主生於婚後次年，第二位公主伊蓮在一九三九年八月間呱呱墮地，在女王一家由納粹鐵蹄下逃向倫敦時，她纔出世了幾個星期呢。第三位公主瑪格麗今年五歲，是在美國誕生的，在納粹轟炸倫敦時，裘麗娜為孩子的安全而避居加拿大。</p>
<p>戰後回到荷蘭，又生了第四位公主曼麗克。</p>
<p>裘麗由她母親那裏得來天賦解決問題的本領，同時由她父親那裏得來愉快的精神，使她獲得許多朋友。她年紀雖輕，但却經騐豐富，她有生以來即己準備担任她今天所負起的重任——為道六千五百萬人民的王國的憲君。事實上她在戰爭結束以來，她就己經担負了不少責任。今年她曾經代她母親攝政了兩次。她懂得她的人民，也暸解她的地位。從她那能幹而穩重的母親地裏，她學得一切。在孩提時代，她的職任已被明白地訓示過，當裘麗娜尙是一個小公主時，她和母親在陽台上接受民眾的歡呼。她問母親道。「媽，這些人民都屬於我的嗎？」「不，」她母親回答道：「你纔是屬於他們的。」</p>

<p>戚之被捕，實與今年轟動一時之徐繼莊貪汚案有關，蓋當局追緝徐繼莊風聲最緊之際，戚助其藏匿寓所，而得潛逃香港。後經人吿發，始遭扣押，經軍法處數月之研訊，最後宣判死刑，呈報國防部轉呈總統審閱核准。</p>
<p>昨晨八時，戚再玉自警備部看守所中提出時，身穿格子紡短衫褲，白襪，黃皮鞋，形容憔悴，當朱誠科長宣讀總統電令後，戚面色蒼白，惟尙故作鎭靜，要求准寫遺書一通給其妻兒，但當其寫畢三張信箋時，雙手已顫動不克自制，執行前戚飲高梁酒一杯，並注射麻醉劑一針，然後雙手加以反綁，由特務連士兵押往刑塲，拖至草地中以三八式步槍執行槍決。前後計放三槍，第一槍彈中後頸，越兩分鐘再發第二槍，兩腿及混身顫動不已，口中猶有呻吟聲，迨發第三槍後，始吿氣絕。行刑後，軍法處卽以電話通知戚妻，前往收屍。</p>
<h3>兩件貪污案經過</h3>
<p>戚再玉現年四十三歲，浙江嘉興人，敵偽時期奉命在滬主持秘密電台，頗著功績；勝利後，率調警備部稽查處滬北稽查段長；三十六年春，稽查處行動隊改組，戚擔任第六稽查大隊長之職；平時工作頗稱幹練，乃以平時沉緬於聲色塲中，傳染俗習，致有此下塲。戚之貪汚案揭發經過，起因於徐繼莊案，戚平時出入歌合舞榭間，各識徐妾王白梅（曾為百樂門舞女）徐案旣發，戚奉命辦理？王白梅以私交及以金錢為誘，戚乃先將徐藏匿，繼復助其化裝難民逃往香港。乃事機不密，徐繼莊之自備汽軍在戚寓發現，事遂洩露。除徐案之外，於去年十二月間，戚接獲密報，有吳寳康者，隱匿敵偽物資甚夥，有無綫電方棚萬餘隻，軍用電話機百餘只，藏匿永慶路六九弄六號三樓，戚於呈准後，飭由該隊上尉稽查員陳文貽率員於去年十二月十三日上午十時許，將吳寳康拘捕帶隊，交該隊少校督察周文遠等承訊收押，戚以有幾可乘，由金潤聲經手，向吳寳康勒索四億五千五萬元，百託名獻金，以為掩飾，並作為賞金分配部屬，藉杜衆口。該案亦經被害人吿發，由驚備司令宣鐵吾下令究辦</p>
<h3>遺書</h3>
<p>昨晨戚再玉致其妻子之遺書，詞意悽楚，筆跡潦草，內容稱；「今晨玉奉令將被執行，一切不及，恐汝尙在夢中未起，此次因觸犯海陸空軍刑法判處死刑，未予上訴機會，似難甘服，此次奉令執行，實有無限感慨。此後汝等應返鄕苦度，雲雲，　　，好好教育。（中略）茲有數點請照應，雲雲不讀書，應速返鄉經營米行，以後不可做官，免受寃曲。年奴南山在我家巳久，此後仍在家中，大家視同家人。岳母年事高，多予照顧，汝返鄕後，開納路住宅可退還業廣地產公司，租戶合同在馬君碩律師處，一切可託馬律師辦理。上海人情凄凉，玉平日對人熟誠，一旦有事，尙少人照顧，今後當更不堪設想。（中略）此刻心亂如麻，想　亦寫不出，一切善自珍重，將來在鄕可念佛以求佛佑，亂世人不值錢。尙有一事，聞常州新有一孩，可問秀珍，可能將來亦教育之。象牙筆（鋼筆）一支留作紀念。再玉絕筆。九月五日上午八時三刻。</p>
<h3>戚案牽連人多　兩犯各判五年　五人宣告無罪其餘送地檢處</h3>

<h3>經濟檢查會報中決定　加強檢查工作　大量拋售物資　沒收貨物出售後建議三項用途</h3>
<p>上海區經濟管制督導員蔣經國氏，昨晨十時假國行會議室，召開經濟檢查會報，到警察局長兪叔平，副局畏兼特刑處長張師，經濟檢查大隊長程義寬，金管局長林崇墉等有關各機關首長多人。據悉：昨日會報中，，除檢討過去一週來之工作，就各執行人員進行工作經過情形之報吿，詳加掛討外，並決定下週繼續　强檢查，工作計劃，亦經決定為：（一）加强繼讀上週檢查工作。（二）為解決物資之供應，增加　商原料之需求，下週起由物資調節委會，大量拋售市上缺乏之各項物資。（三）經予檢查沒收之大量囤積物資，己向中央建議，全部出售，至靡獲款項，建議三點用途：（甲）一部撥充淸察學生獎學金，（乙）一部份救濟難民，（丙）慰勞前方將士，至十一時始散。</p>
<p>經管檢查委會獎勵市民密告</p>
<p>政院經濟管制委員會滬區檢查委員會，昨以滬檢秘字第一號發表公吿稱：「本會己於九月二日正式成立，在中央銀行大樓四一〇號開始辦公，擔任滬區經濟檢查工作，凡在上海區有囤積居奇，操縱市塲私抬物價，或經營黑市買賣，企圖獵取暴利，擾亂經濟金融的人，望我全體市民本着愛護國家的然誠，來向本會檢舉，或投函密告（密吿應列舉事實證據，並寫明姓名住址，本會對檢舉人姓名，當絕對保守秘密），一經查明屬　，當依法重懲，並對檢舉人　予提成獎勵。又本會執行檢查人員，在外行使職權時，倘有藉端勒素，貪污凟職情事，亦望市民前來檢舉，本會定當　　。」</p>
<h3>皮革商夫婦看電影受驚　兩盜跟隨上汽車　駛至荒僻處搜刼</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕林森中路茂名路國泰大戲院，最近放映綠野銀駒電影，賣座鼎盛。昨晚八時四十五分，末第二塲映畢後，觀衆魚貫而出，內中有經營皮革生意之管勝康者，寓南京西路一一五號，亦由該院偕妻出外，甫至大門外轉角擬跨登自備汽車（該車照會為〇三·九四九二），不意後面隨來兩匪，各出短槍，一匪躍登軍廂內，一匪在前面，駕駛汽車，沿林森路東行，折入八仙橋，轉入金陵中路朝西至徐家匯荒僻處，恃強搶刦管妻之金項鏈鑽戒及皮夾內現鈔等物，復將汽車掉頭東行，至蘭心大戲院附近，將管夫婦兩人驅逐下車，臨行時語云，如要汽車，至大世界找尋，事後管驚魂稍定，卽投報盧家灣警分局，宋分局長據報，卽出動大批員警，乘警備車四出兜捕，並通知其他各分局一體協助跴緝，逾兩小時半，該號汽車果在中正中路大世界之西南京大戲院隔壁新華舞　門首發現，經警局查獲後，交失主管勝康具領駛回，一面繼續追緝在逃匪犯。</p>
<h3>保險業計劃發起　大規模保險運動　疏導游資培養保險美德</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕幣制改革後，此間保險業，刻正計劃發起大規模之保險運動，藉以疏導社會游資，同時培養國人保險之美德。預定計劃，除將原有保險業務如再保險，水險，火險，壽險等加强推進外，並擬在壽險中，添辦國民保險及乘客保險等新業務，俾使保險業務日趨社會化。保險界人士表示，此項運動，在落後之社會中，尙有賴政府之倡導及社會各界領袖人士之協助，方能收事半功倍樂觀厥成之效。</p>
<p>可使游資獲得歸宿</p>
<p>此間保險業領袖羅北辰氏昨語記者稱：保險業可使游資獲得二種正當歸宿：（一）生產資金：歐美保險業吸收資金後，大多投資於工礦鐵路及各種開發工程等事業上，純屬生產性質之投資。（二）社會資金：保險之原則，為幸福者幫助受災者，保費係供社會上受災之衆人享受，聊以彌補其受災之虧損，故保險資金，實亦即社會之資金。</p>
<p>促進國民充份認識</p>
<p>渠稱：英國近已推行社會保險，凡國民自出生以至埋入墳墓，人人均獲一定之保障。此事在我國，亦非絕不能舉辦，徒以我國國民風習，對保險尙乏充份之認識。惟最近國防部正將着手辦理軍人保險，性質係屬壽險加傷害保險，要亦為社會保險之開端。此間保險界擬積極倡導之國民保險，乘客保險，及旅行保險等業務，如能擴大範圍，及於全體國民旅客，則每單位所收之保費愈趨低廉，而國民旅客在在均擭保障。渠望於短期內，邀集此間保險界人士，聯合發起推廣保險運動，以促進社會各界對保險事業之認識。</p>
<h3>張亞民死刑待最後批准</h3>

<h3>青年空軍在成長中　胡偉克談空中教育的基礎</h3>
<p>— 本報特派員　儲裕生</p>
<p>〔本報杭州二日訊〕在我們慶祝記者節的日子，也正是翱翔在我們祖國領空鐵翼神鷹搖籃的誕生日。這個紀念日，在杭州有着特殊意義，因為我們空軍的搖籃，就在杭州附近的筧橋，記者首先要向讀者報道，就是這空軍的搖藍—空軍軍官學校，己經十九度寒暑了。這空軍的搖籃，她逐批逐批的訓練出如許空中的英雄，現在遍佈在中國的每一個角落，擔負起艱巨的任務，而這搖籃的本身呢？雖然在物價高漲經費短絀的情形下，但是也在不斷地求着進步。尤其這一兩年來，胡偉克校長以「雙手萬能，人定勝天」的信念，完成了綠化筧橋的計劃。他們己種植了二十多萬株樹木，都己欣欣向榮地在生長。更完成了廿餘公里長的環校公路，廿餘公里長的環校河渠，貫通了校區中心。同時，又完成了交通幹道上的必要軍事配備。另外利用日軍繳出來的炸彈，建築了一個規模宏大的炸彈台，用以提高校內同人的警覺。</p>
<p>建設自力村</p>
<p>他們利用了勞動服務的精神，完成了機械士的卷屬住宅，題名為「自力村」。堪稱奇蹟的是：他們不費分文，僅利用校內的廢鐵水泥，自建了公路重級橋樑「筧橋」。這橋的造成，頓使空校的前門增加了很多的壯麗，而節省公帑總在法幣千億以上</p>
<p>校內除了原有的游泳池和運動塲之外，更添建了跑馬塲，空軍勇士的人像台，大型的噴水池，音樂台，認天舞會塲等。</p>
<p>生產方面，他們辦了兩個農塲，農場的產品，按照市價折半供給全校官生。另外還有器皿廠，豆腐廠，輾米廠。豆腐廠和輾米廠淘剩下來的渣滓，可以　猪，還有馬房，牛塲等等。</p>
<p>現在他們還在積極的造林，所有的林木以菓樹為多，則將來空校中的健兒，有着無窮的口福。</p>
<p>飛機的出動</p>
<p>兩年來，空校中飛機出動的次數達一萬〇三百九十次，每天總要出動十八架至二十架，修補的飛機達二千七百九十六架。他們所有的飛機並不多，但能出動這樣多的次數，這不得不歸功於該校教官們的努力。他們出版的刊物有十七稱，康樂，音樂，遊藝活動，也特別注意，共有三百〇九次之多。</p>
<p>很多人以為空軍的待遇較其他軍隊的待遇優越不少，其實空軍體格第一，對營養應該特別注意的，在英美各國空軍的待遇也特別注意的，殊不知現在我們的空軍教官，待遇相等於陸軍，不過多加一點飛行津貼罷了。他們學生的伙食兩素三葷，六七月的時候，連魚也吃不着。鷄鴨之味，不嚐久矣，水菓也早就取消了。</p>
<p>空校新制度</p>
<p>胡偉克校長，他是一個圾努力的前進者，他自担任空軍官校教務以來，毅然地縮短教育的年限，改革了教育的制度，而新制度下產生的第一批舉業生，分發到各個部隊去以後，部隊長都感到分外的滿意，在他的努力下，經費困難，居然為他所克服了。</p>
<p>現在在杭州的上空，時常出現着一羣羣新型的教練機，這批教練機是PT十七，是我們中國自己造的，自從我們中國造成這批飛機以後，很多人還懷疑它的性能，甚至懷疑到它能不能飛起後不致墜下。胡偉古校長和他們學校裏的教官到飛機製造廠去，胡校長首先試飛，然後證實了這種飛機有他的堅强的性能，於是成羣的新型飛機被駕駛着飛回空軍官校。現在我們中國的飛機製造廠，正不斷地在趕造飛機，以應我們靑年空軍的需要。</p>
<p>大編隊表演</p>
<p>九月一日那一天，他們除了舉行慶祝大會外，並且還舉行了飛機大編隊的表演，所表演的飛機都是自製的。另外，還舉辦了水上運動會，音樂會，舞會。在音樂會後，還有一次大聚餐，中美空軍舉杯相慶，濟興正濃。他們歡度了校慶紀念日。</p>
<p>空權的時代</p>
<p>我曾和胡校長談論着如何建立强大空軍的問題，他說：「空軍軍官的養成教育，只有一個學府，在我們廣大祖國的領空上，自是覺得不夠的。同時，中國空軍的基礎，到底還是建在全國人民大衆的身上，而中國人民身體孱弱，不够空軍的條件，這也實在是擴展强大空軍的障碍。」</p>
<p>今後空中的運動將特別加繁了，因為空中的交往，將把世界的時空，縮短了不少，所以沒有强大空中人才的國家，將永遠被人家所奚落。今後是空權的時代，我們人民應該作必要的準備，與空中教育相配合，俾得迎頭趕上空權時代。</p>

<h3>北平南長街怪屍係勤務兵蔡湧泉　死因或為桃色糾紛</h3>
<p>〔本報北平五日電〕平南長街怪屍案，曾刋八月卅日本報。該怪屍名蔡湧泉，係南花園一號樓下房主王煥亭之勤務兵，王為津警備部稽查處副處長。蔡生前與王之女公子王書華情感甚篤，並曾私贈蔡湧泉自綉手絹，且曾合照一影，蔡於去歲八月間被辭退，事隔一年，忽於本年四月間失踪，今在王姓屋頂發現怪屍，據其胞兄蔡玉泉辨認，可能即為蔡湧泉，其背景亦可能為一複難而嚴重之桃色糾紛，發現該怪屍之警長趙正平登樓驗屍時，並檢獲子彈殼一粒，故蔡又可能為槍殺。蔡兄玉泉除將一切證物送地院偵訊外，曾急電在滬警局總務股任副股長之蔡叔蔡省三，請為弟雪寃。</p>

<h3>秋收前夕　南通棉產量增三分之一</h3>
<p>— 本報記者　叢永樞</p>
<p>〔本報南通三日快訊〕再過半個月的時間，棉花就要上市了。收購棉花的行商休息了一個短短的時期以後，又將重振旗鼓了。</p>
<p>南通的植棉面積，據估計：今年增加　十萬多畝，產量也相對增加，估計產棉可能增加工萬市担以上，約近去年總產量的三分之一。</p>
<p>鷄脚棉行商收購</p>
<p>南通向為我國重要棉產地之一，棉質一向相當好，後來試種「鷄脚棉」，經過多次改良，己成為今日南通一帶普遍的棉種。因為這裏的棉花可供紡二十支細紗的用途，所以江南廠商如中紡，新申，棉麻等，往年每屆棉花上市的時候，多派專人或委託這裏的行商收購，互相放價搶購，甚至急不擇貨。今年這個棉產劇增的消息，一定為這些廠商所注意的。</p>
<p>去年南通植棉面積託九十萬零五百畝，其中植美棉者約二十萬畝，其餘仍植中棉，就收穫量說：美棉比中棉多，平均美棉每畝可收皮棉二十四市斤，中棉僅可收二十八點八市斤。所以去年整個皮棉產量為二十六萬九千七百四十四市祖，今年植棉面積增加到一百零八萬畝，產量計三十八萬五千六百六十二萬担，較去年增加十一萬五千八百八十八担。</p>
<p>岱字棉成績優異</p>
<p>通阜植棉指導區於復員後，更在這裏推廣岱字棉種，獲得優良的成績，據該處統計：今年新推廣區，佔地一萬二千四百一十八畝，另外有農民把去年推廣的岱字棉自行留種或自動換種的，計五萬九千畝，併起來，播種岱字棉田計七萬一千四百一十八畝。雖說有了很大的推廣，但比起今年植棉面積來，僅抵十五分之一，要把這優良棉種推廣全境，還有待更大的努力。</p>
<p>產量增兩大原因</p>
<p>今年南通棉產量可能增加的原因，一在於植棉面積的增加。植棉面積的所以能增加，主要在於最近九年來棉價較高的緣故。戰前大概一担花可以抵三石米，去年己經升到五石米才能抵得上一担花，目前的花價，也離這個比值不遠。農民看到這個情形，自然都意捨棄食糧不種而改種棉花了。其次是由於氣候適宜，今年夏初播種後，雨水可算非常調和，棉株發育情形很好，秋來氣候也很好，對棉的開花，結實，非常有利。</p>
<p>可是，這都是從有利的地方說的。如果放眼向廣大的原野仔細看一看，那些游匪騷擾的地區，豐富的棉產是是否可為我們控制還是問題。在這秋收前夕，希望自衛武力能發揮一些力量，爭取這一筆巨量的物質。</p>
<p>蘇北區普遍增產</p>
<p>整個蘇北棉田面積今天也有很大的增加，棉產量因之也有很大的增加。據統計：南通·海門·啓東·崇明·阜寗·鹽城·東台·寶應·高郵·興化·如皋及江南的常熟等十二縣的棉田計四·一四六·一三二畝，較去年增加六三五·八九一畝，棉產量也自一·〇五三·七三七市担增加到一·二六四·二四四市担。其中崇明·寶應·高郵·等三縣，去年棉產量計二九·六〇六担，今年還沒有將調查數字列入。一舤產來，各縣產量都有增加，僅鹽城因屢遭匪軍竄擾，產量稍有減少。</p>
<p>甘省實施土改</p>
<p>〔本報蘭州四日電〕甘省土改，前擇定高台·慶陽等縣實施，頃經產省府重予考慮收入永登·榆中兩縣。本年九·十二月共需經費五萬二千餘金圓，預計全部計劃可於兩年六個月至八個月完成，省府擬就之「舉辦扶植自耕農工作計劃，」即呈政院核准撥款後施行。</p>
<h3>台糧走私別記</h3>
<p>— 本報特派員　吳守仁</p>
<p>〔本報台北三日航訊〕台灣糧食武裝走私情形，前稿已有記載，茲再舉一例如下：案情是這樣的：本年三月，有台北的糧商振豐行店主陳坤來，向糧食局聲請准許以白米一千包，（合主萬市斤）運至澎湖救濟糧荒。按澎湖這地方本是台灣西部海面的幾個小島，雖不是不毛之地，却粒米不生，僅能出產一點玉蜀黍，而居民也有七八萬人口，終年糧食需要，完全靠台灣本島供應，因此，省政府特准糧商經營淤湖的糧食運銷。</p>
<p>糧船之舵變更方向不過，糧船要經過海面，航行的目的地，櫂操在糧商手裏，誰能保證他們一出港口，不把舵的方向變要？所以省政府為貫澈執行禁令起見，也制定了一種法則：即糧商運銷澎湖糧食，須獲糧食局的許可證，出口的時候要以股實鋪保向海關具結保證，到澎湖之後，還要取得卸貨地區警察所的證明文件，送回海關查驗，纔算完成法定手續。當時糧食局接到振豐行運銷澎湖食米一千包的由請，正當澎湖發生糧荒向省府吿急的時候，於是容容易易地發給了一紙許可證，並且限三月三日要啓運，過期作廢。台南的海關在三月四日才據報關，由一艘名呌瑞成的機帆船裝着這一千包食米，附有糧食局許可證同了聯大行的保證切結，手續無懈可擊，當然放運，祗等卸貨地區警察所的證明文件一到，這椿買賣即可結束。</p>
<p>所謂回證全屬偽造果然，三月五日台南關就接到運米的人送來澎湖西嶼警察所的證明文件，載明瑞成號機船在西嶼卸了一千包食米，但不知什麼靈感，忽使台南關的人員懷疑這回證的眞實性起來，於是將原回證函送西嶼警察所查詢，不幸西嶼警察所的覆信竟證實了這個懷疑所謂回證原來是偽造的。</p>
<p>招牌虛設店舖失蹤台南關展開了查緝工作，首先找聯大行的保人，然而聯大行這個店鋪竟失蹤了。據原地址的房主說是臨時有人要求訂上了這塊招牌，僅二三天就拿下，這個訂牌的人也不知去向。顯然，這是一件設計週密的走私案。台南關把它報吿了財政部，到六月初旬財政部咨文省府轉令糧食局查究，糧食局就把全卷移送台北地院檢察處偵查。事實似乎很明顯，問題的關鍵應該在申請運銷的振豐行，但振豐行的店主陳坤來辯說根本不知道這件事，而　柬岡章和私章却幷非偽造，不過是給不知是誰偸蓋了的。大家都希望瑞成號機船能够再回來而把它抓住，因此，案發前後，始終保守着秘密，直到現在，這還是一件未被發掘的秘密新聞。</p>

<p>一週經濟</p>
<h3>一般物價　加強管制厲行限價</h3>
<p>上過為財政經濟緊急處分令頒布以來，金圓券問走後的第二週，當局在堅決的意志下，加強實施管制經濟，嚴格執行限價，在這種局面下，商人當不敢以身試法，公然違反法令，故市塲亦少特殊反應。不過，由於游資過度的鬆濫，當局迄禾制定有效的疏導辦法，這對於當前的物價，多少總是一種隱憂。據估計，上週市上游資擁塞，數在五千萬金圓以上，其造成原因，當於本刊下節述之。因為游資的鬆濫，暗息激劇下降，曾低見四分半，跌入官訂利率以下，銀行存款因此也頗有增加，總額達六百萬金圓，較前約增百分之六十。</p>
<p>市場交易求多供少</p>
<p>上週商品市塲的物價，走勢並不很正常，因為在當局的嚴格管制下，超過八一九的限價是違法，在八一九限價內交易，又因成本關係，不免虧累。</p>
<p>像紗布市塲就形成交易淸稀，很少做開的現象。熱門紗如藍鳳。雙馬等，均少交易，僅有較少之組紗及雜牌貨成交。龍頭細布報價，屹立廿九元五角的漲限，其他布價，亦多立漲限，有求無供，市塲陷半停頓狀態。惟因事實上之需要，有以物物交換者，大致以四君子元嗶嘰　一元貼換龍頭細布為標準。</p>
<p>一百廿號天橋絲，亦始終站一千一百三十三元三角限價界綫，交易甚少做開。</p>
<p>糧食方面，因產地價格疲軟，去路平淡，週末本市北市塲上白粳價站二十一元。麵粉因社會局禁止八月底以前老棧單交易，幷限令在七天內出現，呌價一度族退至六元五角，週末回至七光三角五分。雜糧食油多站定限價，供應稀少，如靑島吉桶生油價高站六十四元。日用品中如香烟一項，若干烟舖售出以一包為限，且有將燜盒代為撕裂，以免轉售之趣聞。</p>
<p>各業陳述限價困難</p>
<p>本市實施限價，迄至上週末止，巳達兩週，負實督導經濟管制之蔣經國氏，曾向各業訓話，幷聆取意見，據各業陳述苦衷分析之，約不外下列數端：</p>
<p>第一：由於成本增高，限價不易維持。如酒菜業申訴，自十九日後，魚肉。鷄鴨。蔬菜等均頻頻上漲，欲該業維持限償，必須抑平各項原料遵照維持限價。</p>
<p>第二：由於捐稅增高，影響限價。如醬酒業代表指出幣制改革後，鹽稅突吿增加，影饗醬油鹹貨成本。鮮猪業陳述因運價，屠宰捐，衛生檢查費，蘇北綏靖等項，均有增加，使限價不易維持</p>
<p>第三：由於廠盤出貨價高，使限價不易維持。棉布業申述，如能頭細布，該業現在中紡配布價為二十九元三角，限價為二十九元五角，利潤似有二角，但營業稅一項卽需繳納九角，再加數天之利息，運費等，不勝虧累。捲烟業亦稱烟廠配貨少，賣出補不進，來源有斷絕之虞。</p>
<p>第四：由於供求關係，價格略有漲落。蔬菜業報稱該業全係代客買賣，既不能囤續，亦不可居奇，二十三日後價格稍昂，因受天時落雨關係，盼政府在運輸方面予以方便，减少成本。</p>
<p>第五：由於組織鬆懈，不易管制。如樹柴業稱，該業甚多同業朱加入公會，非法從事黑市交易，甚雞管制。</p>
<h3>上海工商協會　指數編製說明</h3>
<p>（一）本會成立於民國三十五年十一月，抗戰期間物價材料本無搜集，故所編指數暫自民國三十五年一月起始藍因抗戰勝利後最初數月內地工業頗多在東遷途中，一時生產尙未恢復常態，故自去年一月起始計算。</p>
<p>（二）民國三十五年度，指數每月編製一次，以每月五日。十五日·二十五日之批發物價計算。自三十六年度起每週編製一次，以每週一至週五之批發物價平均計算。因本會所編每週指數須在週六編就，故選用物價材料祗能至週五為止。</p>
<p>（三）本會編製指數共計三種，一為按貨物用途分類上海批發物價指數，二為按加工程度分類上悔批發物價指數，三為按進出口貨分類上海批發物價指數。</p>
<p>（四）本會編製指數以民國二十五年全年作基期。蓋因二十六年己面臨戰爭，華北己入非常局面，政治經濟情形己非如平時穩定，似不宜選作基期。</p>
<p>（五）普通指數之編製均以一〇〇為基數，但最近物價較基期高出己十萬倍以上，故以一為基數以求簡便。如下表所列今年十一月份第四週食物類指數為七五三〇五，即表示這一週食物平均價格為民國二十五年全年平均價之七萬五千三百零五倍。</p>
<p>（六）本會編製三種指數概用簡單幾何平均法。指數之編製當然以加權計算較為翔實。但在目前我國統計資料極端貧乏之現狀下，權數之採訪困難萬分，僅能參照各類貨物交易數量，在各類貨物之取捨中隱具加櫂作用，因此每類包括之貨物種數不盡相同。</p>
<p>（七）自民國三十六年一月以後每月指數均由同月各週指數用簡單幾何平均法計算之。</p>
<p>（八）本版篇幅有限，每期將各種指數全部刊登勢所不能，祗能輸流刊登。例如第一期刊登按貨物用途分類上海批發物價指數，自民國三十五年一月至今年十一月第四週為止。週後之第二期刊登按加工程度分類上海批發物價指數，自民國二十五年至今年十二月第一週為止，但此時不再刊登按貨物用途分類指數之全部數字，僅載十二月第一週該種指數各類數字及總指數。二週後之第三期刊登按進出口分類上海批發物價指數，自民國三十五年一月至今年十二日第二週為止，另刊以上二種指數十二日第二週各類數字及總指數，不再刊登三十五年後全部數字。</p>
<p>（九）為使讀者易於瞭解物價波動之實際情况起見，各種指數表後另附指　曲綫圖。但因篇幅有限，每次僅能附圖一楨，按物價指數曲綫圖之繪製可有多種方法，本會為使讀者易於比較各類貨物價格波動之趨勢及比較同一時間各類貨物價格比基期上漲之倍數起見，將數種指數曲綫畫在同一圖上，例如，按貨物用途分類編製之指數共有七類，連同總指數，共有八條曲綫。將八倏曲綫合併繪在同一圖上勢將糢糊不淸，故僅擇四條，其餘祗能留在以後再刊。</p>
<p>（十）曲綫圖左方所註數字為指數。但按其對數次序排列。例如指數一千之對數為三指數一萬之對數為四，指數十萬之對數為五。指數一千到一萬的縱距離與一萬到十萬之縱距離相等。凡曲綫上縱距離相等之二組點子其首尾二點物價上升倍數之比例相等，</p>
<p>（十一）曲綫圖橫軸代表時閒，以每月為單位。</p>
<p>（十二）三十七年八月份幣制改革後，自九月份第一週起，照法幣三百萬合一金圓，改按金圓計算，編製方法仍舊。</p>
<p>（註）本說明前曾在報上刋登一次，茲因各方時有來函詢問編製方法，特再路加修正，公布如上。</p>

<h3>貨幣金融</h3>
<p>（一）銀根暗息</p>
<p>銀根鬆濫亟待抽緊　上週乃改幣以市銀根鬆勢，迄未稍歛，這當然是市塲游資過剩的結果，而游資之所以充斥，其原因仍不外：（一）兌進金銀外幣，兌進金圓券。（二）當局收購物資之付款，為數頗夥。（三）一般礙於政治壓力，需單者寥落，致行莊存款雖增，放款反轉寰落。（四）證交開業無期，游資苦無出路。雖說政府己決定拋售物資及出售國營事業，如擬售人絲一萬餘箱，（合一千萬元，）中紡發售股票一百卅萬股，（合三億九千萬元，）及拱應廿萬噸美軍剩餘物資，（合一億五千萬元）等等，但這些決定，尙在計劃的階段，對上週銀根之鬆歛，自無實際上的影響可言。</p>
<p>游資去路頗堪注目　倒是有一種現象頗堪注意，據悉，上週下半週以後，銀錢業拆放頭寸己漸轉正常，其原因，又據說與客戶競購貨物有關，假如游資在苦無出路之際，最終仍以物資為攻擊的目標，那實在使人太失望了！不但如此，本市游資亦有紛紛琉往外埠的跡象，這可能是由於客地管制稍寬，與物價稍低所引起，誠如是則起而繼之者，可能是物資的外移，這無異對本市的物價，又加上了一重，使之上漲的壓力，可見不再製造游資，與疏導游資，己是刻不容緩的事了。</p>
<p>行局鉅進前途暗談　上週自週一至週五，國家行局庫交換結果，計共差進三百五十六萬三千餘圓，與前週同期內差出五百餘萬圓相較，增進甚鉅，在游資泛濫的今日，這當然是一種好現象，但想到改革幣制以前，所施用的一出一毽政策，雖然獲利甚豐，但也就是這個過程的不斷反復，斷送了法幣的生命，則金圓券的主宰者，不能不以此為戒！　上週外商銀行一反前週現象，再現鉅額差進，自週一至週五，計共差進卅六萬六千九百五十二圓，較前週同期內增進一百一十萬圓以上。</p>
<p>游資潛力未可輕視上週暗息，大致僅在月息七最低甚至有落至三分者。貨帮貼息，日拆亦不過二三元而己，合月息在六分至九分之間。行莊頭寸普遍鬆弛，同業拆放，毫未做開，行莊甚且有拒收客戶鉅額解存者，頭寸之濫，可以概見。　銀錢業牌息，上週亦一再掛低，週一存息二分四，欠息一角零在厘，同業六分。週三掛低為存息二分一，欠息九分，同業四分五，但週五存息與同業又提至週一之水準，當與一般交易轉旺，需單稍見轉股有關，游資的潛力，實未可輕估呢！</p>
<p>六十號以後行莊交換結果，自週一至週五，共產出三百六十四萬四千圓，其間扣除台灣銀行，五天內二十三萬〇一百元差出不計，則商業行莊間接交換之實際差出數，當為三百四十一萬三千九百元，較前週同期內增出三百八十餘萬元，這也是游資在找尋出路的信號！</p>
<p>（二）內外匯率</p>
<p>上週本市商業行莊匯率，尙見平穩，穗　匯水，週三以前，　站二十元未動，但週五突提升至五十元，可能受匯款增加之影響。厦匯匯水，週五以前，均為二十元。</p>
<p>渝匯匯水　有降低，週一為六十元，週二三為四十元，週五再降至二十元。漢匯尙平，週一匯水為六十元，週二降至四十元後，未見續落。</p>
<p>津匯匯永趨升，週一為十元，週二升至二十元，通五再加十元，這與改制前津匯經常有貼水的現象，大相逕庭。</p>
<p>上週外匯結匯續有交易，價約在三元八角五分與三元七角五分左右。金價銀樓業掛牌雖照舊，但該業祗以七成飾金售出，致交易轉見清淡。香港金價　落，週二每華兩價二百九十元港元，週四巳跌至二百八十四元。香港美鈔週四收價為五·〇五港元，較開盤跌落近一角，據說係受某行莊倒閉之影響，黃金價格之所以疲滯，則與澳門來貨過多有關。</p>
<h3>監理委員會正式公佈　金圓券發行數額　二九六，八一七，二〇一·四元</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕金圓券發行數額，今日已在金圓券發行準備監理委員會第一次檢查公吿中正式發表。計自本年八月二十三日起至八月終止，全國發行金圓券之數額為二億九千六百八十一萬七千二百〇一元四角。</p>

<h3>助學籃球第二日　大公表演失常　敗於輜汽　仁餘勝汕隊一面倒　今晚節目最後二場</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕大公籃球隊雖擁有世遝二代表，昨晚表演，大失常態，在助學籃球義賽，竟遭日前被晨友迫和之輜湯，以五十九比四十九擊敗，相差達十分之多，大出球迷意外，競寳異常劇烈，輜汽防守嚴密，行動相當緊張。上半時卅二比廿四，輜汽佔先。另幕仁餘於始終前導之局勢下，以四十比卅五輕取汕隊，上半時仁餘二十比十佔先十分。義球拍賣，由李雅谷以金圓券五百元購得，昨晚門券共得九百三十元。</p>
<p>仁餘一路領先七時正，仁餘汕隊首先登塲，樂嘉洲兩罰，先開紀錄，小吳籃下托入，，鵬舉再添一隻，六比〇仁餘佔先。汕隊呼停，淸江雖破鴨蛋，仍難遏仁餘攻勢，仲已，國政，文彝連連獲分，汕隊僅上半時廿比十，汕隊落後。下半時，仁餘仍控制大局，小吳遠射，鵬舉籃下翻身。汕隊僅馬燦希以長射得分，比數成三十比十七。最後數分鐘，仁餘漸見鬆懈，汕隊急起直追，但時不再待，鐘聲響處，汕隊以三十五比四十敗北。</p>
<p>仁餘　犯分　汕隊　犯分</p>

<p>大公一蹶不振壓軸賽，大公以文華，雲山作衛，金典居中，龍潭，柏齡充鋒。輜汽則為滌航，大光，志吉，士選，志軍五將。中圈跳球，龍潭犯規，輜汽先得一分，廖滌航如有神助，兩投兩中，成五比〇。大公苦追，文華頻頻得點，七比六時，輜汽兩罰未中，反被金典乘虛直入，八比七大公首次超出。文龍入代雲山，旗開建　，文華罰入，十一比七，大公鋒鋩，僅以一見，此後即一蹶不振。輜汽，鄭，廖，王三將，有投必中，長傳快攻，使大公無從抵禦，上半時尙餘五分鐘，廿九比十八時，大公以連科，雲山，文華，龍潭，金典，將塲上五將全部調出，仍無起色，上半時卅二比廿四，輜汽佔先八分。</p>
<p>易籃後，戰局入膠着狀態，比數始終為三四球之距離。大公求勝心切，錯誤頻頻，忠强尤失常態。輜汽演出亦漸殺辣，雙方犯規累累。十分鐘後，大公敗局已成，士氣鬆弛，僅文龍一人作困獸之鬥，文華中距離射籃，雖間有得分，仍無補大局。終局聲起，輛汽以五十九比四十九凈勝五球。</p>

<h3>卡乃基哲學</h3>
<p>— 史都</p>
<p>卡乃基（Dale　Carnegie）的那本「處世之道」(Howto　Win　Friends　and　Influence　People）據說巳銷了數百萬冊了。也不曉得巳翻成了多少國的文字，中譯本恐怕也有二　種吧。這是一本好書。至少這是一本討人歡喜的書啊！它吿訴你怎樣去討好他人；如何「施小惠」；如何用適當的魚餌去釣「魚」。還慷慨地吿訴了你蘇格拉底的秘訣，以及許許多多的所謂「偉人」的處世之道。</p>
<p>沒有一個人不想使自己「交際」得好點的。因此，這本書迎合了一般人的口胃，眞正似適當的魚餌般的「釣」得了千萬個讀者。我自己即是被「釣」的一個。常常聽得人們說：「我家的喬奇是一點也不懂交際的！一或「珍連一個朋友也沒有呢！」於是這個「喬奇」或「珍」便發憤地或偷偸地買了這本書，再三地捧讀着。自然，這本書會給他或她很大的影響的，使他們轉變了。一天，我故意將這本書在一個「喬奇」的面前翻弄着。</p>
<p>「啊！這本書我已經熟讀三年了！」他說。二</p>
<p>「三年！」我吃驚地說：「那麼老兄已得了幾個朋友呢？」</p>
<p>「幾個？」他白了我一眼：「「幾打」是說得少的，」</p>
<p>但都市的人們頗多在這樣的苦悶着：有幾打的朋友而嘆息着孤獨；天天在外面握手言歡而嘆息着沒有友情。巴黎人是最善於交際的，但巴黎人也是最缺乏「友情」的。一個法國貴族宣稱：有誰肯給他可貴的「友情」，他願意給他半數的家產。</p>
<p>同一個「拷貝」下的趣劇：人們在優雅地脫帽，　　，　腰，誰都在微笑翁，說着　些全無緊要的話，天氣與電影是最好不過的話題。一個人說：沙士比亞是俄國人！」於是人們說：「是俄國人啊！」誰都小心着不傷他人的感情，因此誰都給了誰很好的印象，於是大家各得了一個朋友。這樣的朋友可能會長久地繼續下去的。他們的友情大概是建築在「共歡」這一點上。假如他們不看電影，不打橋牌，便相對默然，顯得很尷尬的樣子了。</p>
<p>羅曼羅蘭有一句妙言：「人不是金魯意（法國古幣），不能討個個人的歡喜。但卡乃基就偏要我們去討個個人的歡喜。人們為了想做一個金魯意，只得永遠去附和別人，怎樣也不肯批評他人，永遠是模棱二可的說些一差不多」的話。因此，誰都缺乏個性。一個朋友批評我們：「你們好像都是一個版十裏印出來的！好比欣賞意大利石膏像，難得在你們的由上找得思想的痕跡！」</p>
<p>卡乃基哲學使我們顯得浮漢，虛偽，缺乏個性。因此心靈不易交融，無法識透彼此的思想，使我們失去了質樸的，沉潛的，眞實的友情。卡乃基也許已給了你幾打的朋友，可沒有給你一絲一毫的友情呢！</p>
<h3>書朱彊邨</h3>
<p>— 陳左高</p>
<p>歸安朱疆村丈，為遜淸一代詞宗，與王半塘况蕙風鄭大鶴齊名，所譜各闋，律精審，　辭警麗，儼然夢窗第二。評家稱跨常邁制，凌厲躒朱，奏丕功於詞苑者，尤在校勘，繼半塘之校夢窗，而廣闢津涂也。丈名祖謀，字　生，一字古微，號漚尹，鼎革後，改名孝臧，又號彊村，晚淸傳臚，累官禮部右侍郎。庚子拳匪作，兩疏極諫，面西太后，力陳義和拳終不可用，直言骨鯁，不稍阿附。其一生行梗卓犖，詳夏孫桐撰行狀，及陳三立壞墓誌銘。曩者，聆諸前輩娓娓話丈舊事，恒多銘狀未載，爰不揣疏闇，摭述一二：</p>
<p>或傳丈掇巍科，際會實幸。綠彼原諱祖訓，嗣襲乃兄祖謀名以應光緒壬午鄉試。既中式，名遂弗改，而舊諱轉廢。踰歲殿試，自度字跡欹倚，個館閣體，深難金榜題名，會主老某氏私諛相國閻敬銘之子，屬意筆勢者久；迨獲卷大熹，以其絕似閻子手筆，呈卷光緒帝，擬擢第一。帝曰：文雖佳矣，字欠端飭，得母白璧之瑕乎？」遽改置二甲一名，與陳冕對易。發彌封卷後，主老恍悟此科（癸未）傳臚實朱祖謀，而非閻子，二人字跡混淆，致蹈東坡私李方叔後塵，不禁悲憤塡膺，幾瀕於病。先乃父光第，令河南，鞫盜案，平反寃獄，活命凡七（似即昭雪王樹汶之定讞），積善累德，固由來有自。初於彊村，冀中進士已足，洎悉捷報，躊躇滿志，正淹病床褥，含笑瞑目矣。茲事予承鈕耕生太世叔見吿，外界似尠傳聞，且彼與朱第，奕世通好，誼埓膠漆，想非齊東野語。偶憶十年前，沈淇泉太烟伯常蒞舍間，自道與試之日，遽丁母憂，星夜奔喪，以是狀元落第；及補試後，膺二甲二名選，與　翁之登科第，豈不相去逕庭耶？</p>
<p>丈學詞絕晚，年屆不惑，方從王半塘請益，介師友間。越十數載，寓吳與張孟劬商輯詞莂，旋來滬識況蕙風姻伯，縱跡日密；復以況詞入選，欽遲備至，書必稱師，現遺札仍存況又韓小宋兩兄處。</p>
<p>其妻　悍，以是客滬，輒於至友前詈妻曰「獅子」。辛未卒，春秋七十有五，著叢書，為世傳誦。易簧前，妻猶索居姑蘇，視同吳越，丈乃口占鷓鴣天一闋，曰：「忠孝何曾盡一分？年來姜被减奇溫。眼中犀角非耶是，身後牛衣怨亦恩。泡露事，水雲身，枉拋心力作詞人；可哀唯有人間世，不結他生未了因。」沉痛　結，充溢言表，此亦絕筆之詞也。</p>
<h3>罕見之姓</h3>
<p>— 尤墨君</p>
<p>暑假期中，一無事做，悶得很，因常翻閱翻閱古今人筆記，取其各自為節，手倦即可拋書。</p>
<p>在況周儀蕙風簃二筆卷二載亡淸康熙十一年壬子科廣西鄉試題名中有卯章甫，全州人。此姓僅見；光緒己卯武榜五名雞德祥，亦希見之姓。</p>
<p>又葉昌熾緣督廬日記中亦載稀姓很多：有把·扁·禪·公·妥·運·道·丑·俄·脫·先·晚·雅·拓·口·位·杏·蘆·里·東·令·頡·門·尉·敏·於·暢·祿等不經見的姓。複姓則有「合司」·「癿歹」。這些稀姓都是葉氏任甘肅學政，按臨各處取士時所得的，分載記十及記十一中，原文不備舉。</p>
<p>按我國氏姓，據鄭樵通志略謂左氏所明者：僅「因生賜姓，胙土命氏，及以字，以謚，以官，以邑五者而巳。今則不然，論得姓受氏者有三十二類，左氏之言隘矣！……此外則有四聲。」像上節所舉光。祿二姓皆屬「以字為氏」，云：前者出晋大夫先輔之後，後者紂子武庚字錄父之後，又吐蕃酋長有祿東贊。（編者按：抗戰時昆明憲兵司令為祿國藩。）頡姓屬「以名為氏」，倉頡之後。里姓屬「以官為氏。」本理姓，春秋改焉，晋有里克，魯有里革，鄭有里圻。公姓屬「以爵為氏」，本姬姓，出魯昭公子公子衍。公子為之後，鄭樵以為昭公失國，故其子孫以爵為氏。於姓屬四聲平聲，唐宇文化及將於澄之後。餘若脫·杏·尉三姓亦俱見通志略上·去·入三聲中。</p>
<p>至況。葉二氏所舉稀姓為通志略所不載者，則不易考據了。</p>

<h3>飛行廣告</h3>
<p>— 陳湘</p>
<p>古代的星卜家如果在今年的夏天回到地球上來，他一定會因為看到騰空的發光的紅鬃烈馬，在星羣中搖尾噴水的龐然鯨魚，和凌空懸啣嬰兒的大鷄……這類奇觀的夜景而大吃一驚。他們甚至還可能看到天賜的糧食——大片麵包從天而降，發着神秘的光彩。</p>
<p>這些夜閒的奇觀實在是「飛行廣吿」，是將電光廣吿裝在小飛艇的四邊迭成的。這種新奇的空中廣吿是紐約的戶外廣吿商陶格拉斯。雷的最新的創造物。</p>
<p>雷氏於一九四五年末向美國政府買下了三架被列為剩餘物資的小飛艇，他把它們改造成飛行電光廣吿。但是，在起初無人問津，而開支却駭人的龐大——每架小飛艇一年消費十五萬元美金。可是到了次年秋季，米高梅電影公司向他租用飛行廣吿，為「鹿苑長春」一片宣傳。飛行廣告立即走紅。今天，雷氏買下了美國海軍現在所有的全部的剩餘的小飛艇二十九架，其中五架現在都巳立約租出。這項新奇的廣吿使雷氏一年收入三百萬美金。</p>
<p>飛行廣吿在各種廣告中佔着壓倒的優勢。去年秋天，聯合社在第德律召開編輯會議，通用汽車公司為了搶奪靦特公司的生意，特地替每一位編輯買了一張明尼蘇達州隊對密希根州隊的足球賽的票子，用通用公司的漂亮的新車子「明日之火車」載他們到安阿保地方的球塲去。但是，火車一開出第德律，那節天空暸望軍便擠滿了編輯，原來天空中出現了一隻飛行廣吿，巨大的字體飄浮在火車頭上面，寫道：「福特遙遙領先」，隨着火車亦步亦趨的到達球塲。結果賣力的是通用公司，而得到廣吿實惠的却還是福特。</p>
<h3>「觀日集」</h3>
<p>— 止一</p>
<p>從紐約寄來一本詩集，題名「觀日　“Look　to　the　Sun”，乃作者莫但尼Weston　Mcdaniel送給我們評閱的。</p>
<p>莫但尼，美國佛奇尼亞人，寄寓於羅意西那及佛洛里達，初入馬西爾大學，畢業後，轉入佛奇尼亞大學及西部準備大學，得有文學博士學位，曾當過公立學校教員及校長，戲劇教師，生平最好搜集民歌俗曲。二次大戰時，他也投筆從戎，加人空軍，但抽空仍寫他的詩，得過好幾個詩的特將獎，一個是一九四四年的吉尼獎，兩個楚貝恩出版社送給從軍者的特獎。國內各報和文學雜志上他都投過稿。在這本詩集寫成以前，他已出過「黑暗之窗」與一火的奇蹟」兩集，都富於南方情味。他現在雖寄寓在紐約，但他那遲緩的語調，隨便的態度，可以充分地反映出南方的背景來，然而却不是一個舊式的南方人。他可說是新興的南方人的典型。</p>
<p>「觀日集」共得詩六十三首，大都有力量，有情感，能深深地激刺人心，尤其針對着世間的不人道主義而立言。他用散體詩來寫，所以格外覺得生動。這位詩人是主張人生應與種種消極勢力奮鬥的。他最熟悉南方的風俗信仰，用民歌的方式來表達，把魔術作為一切壓迫的象微，而以山間的美與感動力來描寫人類的希望與快樂。他有預言家的識力與同情心，懂得人性，所以他的詩的確是一新耳目，用的全是俗字俗語，眞所謂「陳言務去」了。總而言之，他有銳敏的觀察力，藝術化的表達力，能予讀者以一種眞切的印象，使他們懂得阻礙文化進步的究是什麼，如果人們因此而把這問題解決了，那便句以進入大同世界。照此看來，他不但是一位南方的詩人，而且也是一位全國，甚至全世界的詩人。</p>
<p>這位詩人所最反對的是儸執之見，有了偏執之見，世界才不能太平，才會發生傾軋。吾們必須從這陷阱中解放出來，方能得救，方能相安無事，快快樂樂的過日子。他的不避俚俗的地方，也是他成功的地方。他善於運用歌謠，雖不合於舊體裁，實在却另闢了一個介。他是一位十足道地的「意象派」。</p>
<p>他的詩有點像我們的古樂府，眞切，單純，不假修飾，自有風趣。他的主張，也很合東方人的脾買。我們是向來不偏執的，儒家主張的乃是中庸之道：不偏方得謂之中。最後，我且引他的幾句詩：</p>
<p>「種族的仇恨，</p>
<p>信仰的仇恨，</p>
<p>仇恨……由來巳久了，</p>
<p>錯中錯，</p>
<p>窒息了每個人的心。」</p>
<h3>十三層樓晚眺</h3>

<h3>Feng Yuxiang and His Daughter Burned to Death En Route from the US to Moscow by Steamer; Ship Catches Fire Carelessly Near Odessa</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Moscow, 5th] Feng Yuxiang and his daughter were aboard the Soviet steamer "Pobeda" traveling from the US to the Soviet Union. Near the port of Odessa in the Black Sea, the steamer carelessly caught fire, and Feng and his daughter were both burned to death. The "Pobeda" set sail from New York in early August, with most of the passengers being family members of Soviet officials being repatriated from the US. En route from Batumi to Odessa, a film was being shown on the steamer, which carelessly started a fire. In addition to Feng and his daughter, there were several other unknown victims. One account states the date of the incident as August 31st, while another says September 1st. The "Pobeda" arrived at the port of Odessa yesterday.</p>
<p>[United Press, Moscow, 5th] It was announced here on the 5th that Feng Yuxiang, the Chinese "Christian General" known for his desertions, was aboard a Soviet steamer which set sail from New York in early August carrying family members of Soviet officials being recalled to the country. After passing through Cairo, the ship picked up another 2,000 passengers. After delivering these 2,000 passengers to Batumi, the ship was en route to Odessa (a Black Sea port) on August 31st when it carelessly caught fire due to the handling of movie film. Feng Yuxiang, his daughter, and several unknown passengers were burned to death. The ship was towed to Odessa on the 4th.</p>
<p>[This Newspaper, Nanjing, 5th] It is reported that accompanying Feng Yuxiang on the trip to the US was his second daughter, Lida. It is not yet known whether Feng's wife, Li Dequan, was also on board. Upon learning of Feng's death by fire, a certain high-ranking government official, a friend of Feng's, expressed surprise as to why Li Dequan was not with him, because according to what he knew, Feng's "transformation" was most influenced by Li.</p>
<p>Brief Biography of Feng Yuxiang</p>
<p>Feng Yuxiang, courtesy name Huanzhang, was originally from Chaoxian County, Anhui Province. He was born in Baoding, Hebei Province in the seventh year of the reign of Guangxu of the late Qing Dynasty (1881 AD). At a young age, he entered the Beiyang Military Academy, but dropped out after less than two years. He joined the Right Army of the Wuwei Army, serving as a company commander in the Ninth Division. Later, he was selected to study at the Baoding Military Academy. In the second year of the reign of Xuantong, he served as a battalion commander in the Third Division, stationed in Zhili (now Hebei Province), and was subsequently incorporated into the Imperial Guards. After the founding of the Republic of China, Feng's troops were reorganized into the Sixteenth Mixed Brigade. In the eighth year of the Republic (1919), during the Zhili-Anhui War, he assisted Wu Peifu. Recommended by Wu, he became co-director of Shaanxi military affairs, and his troops were reorganized into the Eleventh Division. In the thirteenth year of the Republic (1924), he led his troops back to Beijing (now Beiping), where he helped Wu defeat Cao Kun and supported Duan Qirui's assumption of the position of Provisional Chief Executive. Later, he also launched a coup against Duan. In January of the fifteenth year (1926), he announced his retirement from public life, traveled to Russia via Kulun, and toured for half a year. In the sixteenth year (1927), he returned to China and joined the National Revolutionary Army. In the seventeenth year (1928), the National Government was reorganized, and he was appointed as a member of the National Government Committee, Vice President of the Executive Yuan, and concurrently Minister of Military Affairs. In February of the nineteenth year (1930), he allied with Yan Xishan in a third act of betrayal, becoming a "famous turncoat general." In the twentieth year (1931), after the September 18th Incident, domestic leaders united to resist Japan. Feng returned to Nanjing and resumed his position as a standing committee member of the Military Affairs Commission. He once took sick leave and went to Mount Tai to recuperate. His wife, Li Dequan, was from Tongxian County, Hebei Province. The couple were both Christians, hence his nickname "Christian General." After the victory in the War of Resistance Against Japan, in April of the thirty-fifth year (1946), he went abroad to the US under the pretext of inspecting water conservancy. While in the United States, he often made statements attacking the government, and was said to have colluded with elements of the China Democratic League hiding in Hong Kong and the rebellious Li Jishen, forming a close-knit group. On January 7th of this year (1948), the Central Standing Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang passed a resolution to expel Feng from the party. But Feng remained unrepentant. Amidst the uproar of daily events, at the invitation of Li Jishen and others, he left the US in late August and returned to China via Europe, meeting with disaster on a Soviet ship in the Black Sea at the age of 67.</p>
<h3>Tao Qiming Provides Important Clues: Xu Baiqi Instructed Him to Dump Stock; Police Department Will Arrest Him Today for Interrogation</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper, Nanjing, 5th] Xu Baiqi, the Chief Secretary of the Ministry of Finance, who is under house arrest, was confirmed on the 5th to have leaked information based on Tao Qiming's confession, and the Yongsheng Yarn stock dumping case has now entered a new phase. Tao's confession also stated that his dumping behavior was passive, meaning that he was acting on instructions. In addition to pointing out Xu Baiqi's actions, Tao's confession also identified other related personnel who were also instructed. The Police Department dispatched personnel to Shanghai by night train on the evening of the 5th to cooperate with the Shanghai authorities in promptly arresting these related personnel. Tang Honglie and Sun Yulin, the supervisory committee members handling the case, said in this regard: "Until the interrogation of Xu Baiqi is completed, we cannot determine whether the accountable elements of the case end with Xu, because it cannot be determined whether Xu's leaking of information and instructing Tao involves other behind-the-scenes issues." On the 5th, the supervisory committee members interrogated Tao Qiming for as long as seven hours, using various methods to obtain Tao's confession. From a legal point of view, if Tao was indeed passive, his crime will be lighter; from a political point of view, his crime will be more serious. If Xu Baiqi's actions are consistent with what Tao has confessed, then his crime will be even more serious, because he used his position to instruct others to act for speculative profit. As for the Control Yuan's attitude towards this case, Sun stated: "We must wait until the entire case is fully investigated. The judicial part will be handed over to the judicial authorities, and the rest will be processed after the entire report is compiled and then we will study the object and authority of the exercise of supervisory power. However, due to time constraints, it cannot be decided at present."</p>
<p>[This Newspaper, Nanjing, 5th] Xu Baiqi, the Chief Secretary of the Ministry of Finance who is suspected of being involved in the Tao Qiming case and has been under house arrest for three days, will have his fate decided on the 6th whether he will be arrested for interrogation. Xu was still under house arrest on the 5th on the third floor of the Minister of Finance's office, guarded by several criminal police officers, and Xu was forbidden from meeting with outsiders. Xu's expression seemed quite sad. The police originally planned to arrest Xu Baiqi on the 5th for further interrogation, but as of 11 p.m., Police Chief Huang had not been able to meet with Finance Minister Wang Yunwu, so the arrest procedures had not been carried out. The arrest procedures can be decided after Huang contacts Minister Wang on the 6th. Tang Honglie and Sun Yulin, the supervisory committee members waiting to handle the case and interrogate Xu Baiqi, also stayed until 11 p.m. On the 5th, they abandoned the interrogation work of the 5th because they did not get results, but in principle, the procedure of detaining Xu has been decided.</p>
<h3>Our Country's Currency System Reform is a Correct Step</h3>
<p>Criticism from Washington Officials</p>
<p>[United Press, New York, 4th] The "Economic Weekly" published an article on the 4th stating that Washington officials believe that China's currency system reform is a "step in the right direction." Some American financial experts believe that the new gold yuan and the assistance of the Economic Cooperation Administration will greatly curb inflation in China. The magazine continued: "Washington's view is not based solely on the currency system reform plan. The success of curbing inflation also depends on balancing the budget. This will include: first, tax reform; second, government economy; and third, reduction of military spending."</p>

<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 5th] According to Pan Chaoying, a director of the National Diplomacy Association who has just returned from participating in the founding ceremony of the Korean government: "During my brief stay in Korea, I have the following two observations regarding the general situation in Korea: (1) The Korean issue seems to have an interlinked relationship with the Chinese issue, because if war breaks out in Korea in the future, its fate may be similar to the current situation in China.

Recently, the National Federation of Trade Unions and several trade unions have successively expressed their hope that it will not be established, so as to avoid forming a dividing line between state-owned and private enterprises. I believe that the Law on Trade Unions of Public Enterprises should be included in the Trade Union Law and not be established separately. I also advocate that the treatment received by members of trade unions across the country should not be different, so that the two major competent authorities of public enterprises, the Assets Committee and the Ministry of Communications, have formally expressed that the Sun Yueqi, Chairman of the Assets Committee, believes that the Law on Trade Unions of Public Enterprises does not necessarily need to be enacted, while the Ministry of Communications has not yet expressed an opinion."</p>

<h3>Zhang Qun Visits Nara's Famous Sites; Has Discussions with US Commander Swen; Washington Expects China to Promote Early Conclusion of Peace Treaty with Japan</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 5th] Nara Mayor and Prefectural Governor of Nara, an ancient Buddhist cultural city, welcomed Zhang Qun and Shang Zhen to visit the area on the morning of the 5th. Overseas Chinese in the area waved our national flags and welcomed them along the way. Mr. Zhang's party visited Todai-ji (the largest temple in Japan) and other historical sites, returning to Kyoto in the afternoon. Mr. Zhang's party is expected to attend a dinner hosted by US First Army Commander Swen on the evening of the 5th, and then take a special military vehicle to Tokyo. According to sources close to Mr. Zhang, Mr. Zhang will meet with Swen at the First Army headquarters for about an hour on the evening of the 5th, and the matters discussed will not be announced.</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 5th] Diplomatic circles anticipate that China will immediately begin a campaign to promote the early conclusion of a peace treaty with Japan. It is generally believed here that China will use a dialectical argument, believing that Japan cannot truly restore its former economic status before the conclusion of the peace treaty. This point will undoubtedly be a major bargaining chip with US officials, as the United States believes that a sound Japanese economy can be used to counter communism and may also be used to reduce the burden on American taxpayers for occupation costs. It is generally believed that Zhang Qun's remarks to Japanese businessmen in Osaka marked the beginning of this campaign. Mr. Zhang said that China hopes to restore normal economic relations between China and Japan as soon as possible after the signing of the peace treaty, on the basis of reciprocity. Chinese sources here said that the Japanese problem cannot be solved before the signing of the peace treaty, but that the restoration of normal trade would be beneficial to Japan and other Asian countries. Although China is still fearful that Japan will return to its pre-war strong power status, Mr. Zhang's visit to MacArthur has been seen as a new direction in China's policy.</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Loyalty to the Country and Love for Youth - In Memory of Mr. Zhang Jiluan -</h3>
<p>The senior journalist Mr. Zhang Jiluan passed away in the wartime capital of Chongqing on September 6, the 30th year of the Republic [1941]. Today is the seventh anniversary of his memorial service. Mr. Zhang engaged in journalism for thirty years, using the direct pen of a southern censor to serve as a guide for society. Not only did his writings pass down through the ages, but he was also truly immortal. Therefore, Mr. Yu Youren, upon Mr. Zhang's death, praised his thirty years of struggle as having "made great contributions to the country and had a great impact on the times." At the time, public opinion also regarded him as "a journalist of a generation." From the standpoint of an old colleague in the news industry, this newspaper should have a special admiration for Mr. Zhang, and the reporter now wishes to use the position of national mouthpiece to briefly expound on his admirable words and deeds, hoping to provide a model for compatriots. The world is already in chaos, and we mourn the passing of a wise man; the country's fate is still thorny, and we know that his spirit has not faded. Forever remembering Mr. Zhang, we especially hope that the journalistic community will cherish its mission and speak with caution.</p>
<p>Mr. Zhang served in politics early in his life, but his life was ultimately dedicated to the newspaper industry. Although he founded and led the Ta Kung Pao for fifteen years, his early commentaries in the China New Daily had a distinct and indelible impression on middle-aged people, and he also had connections with the Minli Pao and Minxin Pao. Although his life's work was devoted to running a newspaper, and he stayed at one newspaper for more than a decade, his spirit and personality were poured into the entire country and nation. How to revitalize China, how to preserve China's territorial sovereignty, and how to maintain the beautiful traditions of Chinese culture - in a negative sense, how to do everything possible to eliminate the aggressive forces that infringe upon our independence, freedom, and equality - can be said to be the general goal of his life's struggle. In his writing and speeches that advocated for national self-strengthening and revenge for national humiliation, he placed special hope in young people - because young people are the force for our nation's rebirth, and are the talented and capable citizens. In his sharp and clear "editorials" of thousands of words, he was filled with pure loyalty to the country and love for the nation, and at the same time, he naturally revealed his warm heart for caring for young people and guiding future generations. Loving young people is for the sake of loving the country, and believing that loving the country relies on young people who are capable of serving the country; these two meanings are consistent, and can be said to be the center of Mr. Zhang's life's words and deeds. This is what we want to know deeply and inherit and carry forward in commemorating Mr. Zhang.</p>
<p>The term "loving the country" seems very ordinary, especially in modern China, which has suffered too much foreign humiliation. This meaning has long been deeply rooted in people's hearts and has become a standard for journalistic commentary. However, the greatest truth in the ordinary is to believe in it firmly and act on it sincerely. Mr. Zhang Jiluan sincerely believed in loving the country, sincerely loved the country, worried about the country with maturity, and was loyal to and loved China unswervingly and increasingly in his later years. His old friend Wu Daquan often said: "Others also worry about the country and love the country, but Jiluan truly loves the country, and worries about the country from the depths of his heart, never forgetting it day and night." He had been weak and sick since early in his life, but he did not change his habit of staying up late to write, as if the country was calling him; during the War of Resistance, he relocated with his elderly body, traveling between Chongqing and Hong Kong, it could be said that he believed that China could not do without him during the war; even when he was dying, he earnestly asked about the US-Japan negotiations at the time, and his expression was still brave, and it seemed as if the soul of the country had possessed him. Therefore, although he refused to seek officialdom and had no intention of engaging in politics, he paid close attention to politics and was always concerned about the country's fate. Also, therefore, he only joined the Tongmenghui once and never joined a party afterward, but he fully sympathized with the completion of the revolution and unification, because this was the prerequisite for China's independence and strength. Before the Northern Expedition was completed, he earnestly said that "the National Revolution can be successful but cannot fail, and everyone should encourage each other"; after the September 18th Incident [Mukden Incident], his commentary consistently focused on self-strengthening and revenge for national humiliation. As Japan's aggressive ambitions grew fiercer, benefiting from China's disunity, he also had the sincere argument of "using the joint efforts of the people to support the unified situation." During the War of Resistance, the Ta Kung Pao's voice was followed by many, serving as a beacon for the people and valued by friendly countries, because Mr. Zhang's pen strongly advocated the great righteousness of "national sovereignty," "resistance to the end," and "national supremacy and national defense first," which was the most thorough, the most firm, and the most vividly expressed. This spirit of loving the country, piercing the sun and moon, was the reason for its success.</p>
<p>In the winter of the 29th year [of the Republic, 1940], Mr. Zhang had already arrived in the rear, and his colleagues in Shanghai were still working hard to hold the fortress of resistance commentary. Mr. Zhang sent a long article of ten thousand words from Chongqing to the Zheng Yan Bao (New Year's special issue of that newspaper in the 30th year [1941]), which was truly a famous article expounding the national position and the great righteousness of resistance. He explained that the greatest reason for the certainty of victory in the War of Resistance was that our purpose was "absolutely just," that is, "absolutely striving for the independence, freedom, and equality of the nation," and he further explained it. He said: "China only has this one road, and if we walk it熟练ly, see it clearly, and walk it, there will definitely be a day when we reach the end. What is the end? It is independence, freedom, and equality." Finally, he also emphasized "not to expect Japan to turn back," in order to warn colleagues and intellectuals remaining on the isolated island. It was truly "righteous and awe-inspiring, with the power of a thousand pounds."</p>
<p>Speaking of the word "national defense," the reporter recalls a small anecdote, which may as well be revealed today, three years after the victory. At the end of February of the 30th year [1941], the Japanese bandits were quite rampant, and the attitude of Britain and the United States was still ambiguous. Our second National Political Council was about to hold its first meeting. President Chiang Kai-shek, in his capacity as commander-in-chief, was supposed to deliver a speech, and he asked Mr. Zhang in advance for his opinion on what should be said. He specifically stated the essentials of "national defense security." Later, when Mr. Chiang gave his speech, he reiterated the two major goals of current efforts, namely, "resistance must strive for final victory, and nation-building must achieve absolute national defense security." With a far-sighted vision and firm words, he inspired the military and the people, dispelling the enemy's famine and competing for [resources]. According to what was heard, the leader's edict had its own main points, but it must have incorporated Mr. Zhang's views. The government's emphasis on righteous people can be said to complement each other, and his spirit of loving the country can also be developed and immortalized.</p>
<p>Secondly, when we talk about Mr. Zhang's love for young people, there are endless facts and famous sayings that can fully demonstrate his great affection and foresight. Precisely because he loved the country and was loyal to the nation, he cared for the future pillars of the country, whom he called "national youth," with special sincerity and empathy. Because he loved young people, he especially cherished education that cultivates young people. His writings often offered frank and quiet words to teachers who bear the heavy burden of cultivation, not teaching indiscriminately, but saying with tears. The reason why the Ta Kung Pao gained the favor of the education community was not because it catered to young people or praised scholars, but because of its consistent and well-intentioned promotion of young people and respect for the scholarly class. The newspaper's article mourning Mr. Zhang at the time said that he "especially enjoyed promoting young and upcoming talents," which is very true, but one must know that Mr. Zhang's promotion was support and guidance, not praise, allowing young people to engage in all kinds of activities that opposed the status quo. Mr. Zhang's love for young people and respect for scholars was "loving people with virtue," so "honest words do not avoid being offensive." He believed that "good people can accept all words," so he was as unrelenting in his criticism of corrupt and derelict soldiers and politicians as he was in his earnest admonitions to students and young people who were depressed, frivolous, or going astray; he especially exposed the great righteousness of scholars and teachers who were unconventional and high-sounding and despised the country, and he condemned them in words and writing. We still hope that writers who have personally been taught by Mr. Zhang and are willing to inherit his mantle can practice this tradition; although the trends of the times are different, how can we bear to measure our colleagues by daring not to deviate from the "trend of the times"?</p>
<p>Mr. Zhang's care for young people, guidance of young people, encouragement of young people to set goals, and demonstration of targets for young people were tireless throughout his life, even after his death. In the early summer of the 30th year [1941], he was already recuperating on the South Bank of Chongqing, and he still wrote an article "On Political Education" (Ta Kung Pao editorial on April 26) to discuss the methods and standards for giving political education to young people. According to Chen Bulei's memorial article, he had first sent the general idea to Chen, believing that "we must work together to consolidate the foundation of the country," which was already beyond doubt. In this regard, he did not hide political shortcomings, but stated that improving practical politics was more urgent than implementing democracy; however, he believed that promoting integrity and guiding young people was more fundamental than reforming politics. Taking the best as a model, he marked out the standard for "young people to set goals in life" that was suggested in the "Nei Xing" chapter of the Book of Rites at that time. He believed that "as long as young people have passion and ambition, then childishness and impetuosity are not a problem, but if they are frivolous, cold, selfish, then if they are not rescued, it is no different from self-harming the life of the country." He denounced those who were激越, high-sounding, but actually only selfish, and who harmed young people. He demanded that the country have national education that teaches "how to be a person" and teaches "how to set goals," and that it must "have a strong and unyielding personality" and "have a common will to build and defend the country," only in this way can China have true successors and bearers of burdens. Every word is precious, imbued with blood and tears. We hope that young people can read this article carefully, and we hope that the Ta Kung Pao and colleagues in the news industry can follow this beautiful intention and carry it forward, so that we will naturally not see the darkness of the times. As for what Mr. Cai Yuanpei called "君馬" [obsequious intellectual], it will be wiped out due to the revival of Mr. Zhang's great spirit and will no longer exist in our country's forum today. In summary, Mr. Zhang was loyal to the country and sincerely cared for the country's youth. Therefore, conversely, he hated the perverse forces that undermined national unity no less than the aggressive forces that violated our independence and freedom; he hated the Communist Party that惑青 youth and trampled on scientific education no less than the traitors who sold the country for personal gain. His views were impartial on diplomacy and non-partisan on politics. However, he did his best to safeguard the center of the country, not only respecting the leader and constructively criticizing the government during the War of Resistance, but also consistently reminding young people not to forget the national interest and the sacred task of building and defending the country in his newspaper and writings. Here, we would like to quote an editorial written by Mr. Zhang in June of the 25th year [1936] to question the contemporary world:</p>
<p>"Today's unified situation in China was exchanged for at the cost of countless sacrifices. Therefore, only by working together to support this situation and urging its progress and reform can we not allow ambitious people to collude, undermine, and cause unification to return to chaos. This is because, with China's national strength and the urgency of the environment, if chaos is restored, there will be no surplus to rebuild unification." (25th year [1936])</p>
<p>At that time, the latent Communist Party was using a part of the military to try to coerce the leader and carry out its conspiracy. Mr. Zhang's keen eye saw through the treachery. Soon after, the Xi'an Incident turned misfortune into blessing, completing China's unification and laying the foundation for full-scale resistance. Unexpectedly, the government and the people's tolerance after the victory of the War of Resistance led to the rise of the CCP. If Mr. Zhang were still alive today, his deep hatred and abhorrence for the communist bandits who betrayed the Northeast and the national interests, and for how their directed "student movement" poisoned young people, would greatly wound his hopes for governance in his later years. His pen would surely condemn the traitors, deeply reminding young people to be vigilant. Perhaps public opinion would not be as confused as it is today, the student unrest would not be as糜爛 as it is today, and the facts of suppressing spies and suspected students would perhaps not exist. It is not easy to inherit the legacy of a wise man, but we also have reasons to be gratified, because the Ta Kung Pao, which leads the forum, has long been warned against the "traditional mistake" of "enjoying slander and criticism" (Ta Kung Pao editorial on September 7, the 30th year [1941]), and has vowed its arguments on freedom of speech and using speech to serve the country after Mr. Zhang's death, saying: "Freedom of speech is not the freedom to violate the law, harm the country, and harm customs," and that criticizing politics must "be based on the interests of the nation," and that "we must condemn those who harm the interests of the country and the nation without reservation." We deeply believe that Mr. Zhang's spirit is here, and with the successors' self-love and self-respect, the journalistic community can also admire the former model, love the country, love young people, and jointly save the world to comfort Mr. Zhang's spirit in the afterlife.</p>

<h3>Seeking Cooperation with the Socialist Party to Restore Collaboration: New French Cabinet Formed; Schuman Appointed Prime Minister and in Charge of Foreign Affairs</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 5th] After overnight consultations with leaders of various central parties, Schuman achieved the goal of forming a cabinet today. The new cabinet includes nine members of the Popular Republican Movement, seven Socialists, five Radical Socialists, one member of the Democratic Social Resistance Union, and one Independent. The list is as follows:</p>
<p>Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Schuman (Popular Republican Movement), Deputy Prime Minister Marie (Radical Socialist), Minister of Finance and Economy Pineau (Socialist), Minister of the Interior Moch (Socialist), Minister of National Defense René Mayer (Radical Socialist), Minister of Justice Le Coeur (Popular Republican Movement), Minister of Overseas Territories Florette (Popular Republican Movement), Minister of Agriculture Frisanlin (Popular Republican Movement), Minister of Commerce and Industry Lacoste (Socialist), Minister of Veterans Affairs and Pensions Catoir (Popular Republican Movement), Minister of Health Schneiter (Popular Republican Movement), Minister of Public Works Queuille (Radical Socialist), Minister of National Education Revillon (Radical Socialist), Minister of Reconstruction Cottat (Independent Republican), Minister of Information Mitterrand (Democratic Social Resistance Union).</p>
<p>[United Press, Paris, 4th] Schuman agreed on the 4th to try to form a cabinet again. The Socialist Party, which had previously hindered him, has agreed in principle to join the cabinet. The Socialist Party voted 40 to 20 in a meeting to join the cabinet, but Schuman must agree to make some amendments to its economic plan. The fall of both the Schuman and Marie cabinets was due to the opposition of the Socialist Party. President Auriol's political skills have surprised even French politicians. He summoned Schuman and informed him that before officially accepting Schuman's resignation, his resignation was not legal, so in theory, Schuman was still the Prime Minister in charge of forming the cabinet. The President was deeply concerned that if the government collapsed, it would not only require general elections but also lead to an all-out struggle between the Communists and the de Gaulle faction. After Schuman expressed his agreement, he immediately returned to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and consulted with the leaders of the three centrist parties separately.</p>
<p>Furthermore, organized labor unrest, demanding across-the-board wage increases, made it difficult to resolve without a national strike, which prompted Auriol's action. The French Treasury was almost penniless. The government had borrowed heavily from the Bank of France to pay urgent compensation, and the franc continued to depreciate on the black market.</p>
<h3>Italian Colonial Issues to Be Handled by the UN General Assembly: Difficult to Resolve Smoothly Due to Differences of Opinion Among the Four Powers</h3>
<p>[United Press, London, 5th] The United Nations, established to maintain rather than create peace, will once again engage in peacekeeping missions later this month. According to various indications, issues that the four powers cannot resolve are unlikely to be resolved by the UN General Assembly, and peacekeeping efforts cannot be smoothly resolved. The task of this year's General Assembly will be to address the Italian colonial issues. The Korean and Transjordan issues, which the General Assembly has failed to resolve in the past, are still far from being resolved. For three years, the four powers have attempted to find a solution to the future of the Italian colonies in North Africa. When the Italian peace treaty was completed, the four powers decided to postpone the resolution of the Italian colonial issues and, at the same time, hand this matter over to the United Nations. If this issue cannot be resolved by September 15, 1948, it will be automatically resolved by the United Nations unless the four powers order an extension of the deadline for resolving this issue. However, the General Assembly must now have a two-thirds majority to resolve it, so it is extremely uncertain whether this issue can be resolved. Italy's colonies in North Africa include Eritrea, Somaliland, and Libya. It is understood that the four powers all intend to return Somaliland and part of Eritrea to Italy under UN trusteeship, and part of Eritrea will be handed over to Abyssinia. The Soviet Union and France support returning all Italian colonies to Italy under joint supervision. The US policy on Italian colonial issues is more complex due to the election. US policy must consider the US Air Force's new air base in Libya. It is rumored that the US is preparing to establish a base there for the use of super fortresses. Britain had guaranteed to return Cyrenaica and eastern Libya to Italy but now also supports returning it to Italy. Due to the different opinions of the four powers, this issue will become even more complicated in the UN General Assembly.</p>

<h3>Brief Biography of the New Dutch Queen Juliana</h3>
<p>Following the abdication of the former Dutch Queen Wilhelmina on September 4th, Princess Juliana immediately ascended to the throne as Queen, and her official coronation is scheduled for today (September 6th).</p>
<p>Queen Juliana is a direct descendant of the House of Orange-Nassau. The founder of this royal house, William the Silent, waged an eighty-year war against King Philip of Spain in the mid-16th century, ultimately liberating the Netherlands.</p>
<p>Juliana was born on April 30, 1909, in the Royal Palace in The Hague. She was named Juliana Louise Emma Marie Wilhelmina, with the titles of Princess of the Netherlands, Princess of Orange-Nassau, and also Duchess of Mecklenburg through her father, Prince Henry of Mecklenburg-Schwerin. The little princess was born eight years after her parents' marriage. At that time, the Dutch people were worried that the Queen would have no descendants, and a distant German relative would become the Emperor of the Netherlands.</p>
<p>Juliana received a strict upbringing, but her family life was also filled with joy. In her early years, her educators focused on languages and various sciences. She also learned singing and violin, and although she was not particularly fond of sports, she did enjoy skating and tennis.</p>
<p>She was kind and sincere to others, and deeply respected her mother.</p>
<p>The royal family often traveled throughout Europe. When Juliana reached marriageable age, each of her holiday trips sparked rumors about her marriage. The name of every suitable man was reported alongside hers, including the Prince of Wales.</p>
<p>When she turned eighteen, she reached adulthood. On her birthday, her own flag was raised for the first time above the palace allocated to her. Soon after, she enrolled at Leiden University under the name "Miss Van Bureen." Her four years at university were among the happiest of her life. She made many friends and insisted on being called by her first name.</p>
<p>During this period, rumors about her marriage continued to spread. However, around 1935, during a winter sports holiday, she met a young German prince whose name had never been linked to the Princess before. This young man was Prince Bernhard of Lippe-Biesterfeld.</p>
<p>They married on January 7, 1937. Prince Bernhard was a fine man, tall and robust, with beautiful blue eyes. Cheerful and brave, he was deeply favored by his mother-in-law. During the resistance against the Nazi invasion, he fought until the very end before escaping to London to become Queen Wilhelmina's adjutant.</p>
<p>Juliana publicly told the people that she loved him. Their first child, Princess Beatrix, was born the year after their marriage. The second princess, Irene, was born in August 1939, just weeks before the royal family fled the Nazi occupation to London. The third princess, Margriet, is now five years old and was born in the United States. During the Nazi bombing of London, Juliana sought refuge in Canada for her children's safety.</p>
<p>After the war, she returned to the Netherlands and had a fourth princess, Marijke.</p>
<p>Juliana inherited her mother's talent for problem-solving, and from her father, she inherited a cheerful spirit, which won her many friends. Although young, she is experienced. She has been preparing her entire life for the important role she assumes today—to be the constitutional monarch of a kingdom of six and a half million people. In fact, she has already shouldered many responsibilities since the end of the war. This year, she has twice served as regent for her mother. She understands her people and understands her position. She learned everything from her capable and steady mother. From childhood, her responsibilities were clearly taught. When Juliana was still a little princess, she and her mother received the cheers of the people from the balcony. She asked her mother, "Mom, do these people belong to me?" "No," her mother replied, "you belong to them."</p>

<h3>Rice Price for Household Registration This Month: Ordered to Remain the Same as Last Month, Still 3.2 Million Legal Tender per Dou</h3>
<p>[Our Report] The Municipal Food Allocation Committee received a telegram from the Executive Yuan yesterday, ordering that the rice price for household registration in September remain unchanged from August, at 3.2 million Legal Tender per dou. Rice for the poor (broken rice) is 1.6 million Legal Tender per dou. The sale of rice for household registration will start today and end on the 25th. Rice for the poor must be purchased with a separate certificate.</p>
<p>According to the People's Livelihood Committee: The rice price is calculated according to the central government's regulations, which must be converted into Gold Yuan, and any decimal places are rounded. The price of household registration rice is 3.2 million Legal Tender per dou, which is 1.066 Gold Yuan… rounded to 1.07 Gold Yuan. The People's Livelihood Committee allows citizens to purchase rice at 3.2 million Legal Tender per dou to avoid increasing their burden.</p>
<p>In addition, according to news: This decision by the authorities, as well as the US side abandoning the principle of calculating the Sino-US agreement at 95% of the market price, is considered by all parties to be extremely suitable for the needs of the current environment.</p>
<h3>The China Trust Bureau to Auction 20 Units of Enemy Property This Week; Relocation of Residents Will Face Great Difficulties</h3>
<p>The Enemy and Puppet Property Clearing Office of the Central Trust Bureau is accepting seized enemy and puppet properties. In order to cooperate with the new economic plan promulgated by the government, the properties will be sold off one after another to absorb floating capital, so as to avoid it circulating outside and causing trouble. Last week, the Bureau discussed the first batch of 20 units of enemy and puppet houses and properties for sale. These houses are mostly office buildings, and they will be publicly auctioned this week. The reserve price of each office building has been estimated based on the multiplier of August 19, converted into Gold Yuan. The reserve price for the auction may be made public. It is said that after this batch of enemy and puppet houses is auctioned off, one-third of the total amount of Legal Tender issued will be recovered. However, the Bureau is facing a great difficulty in the auction: the residents in these houses cannot be forced to move out, because the bidder must obtain an empty house for their own disposal and use. If the house is already full of residents, the bidder will not be willing to accept it. Therefore, how to solve this problem still needs to be discussed with Chiang Ching-kuo, the economic supervisor of the Shanghai area, for a solution. As for the rumors that the Broadway Mansion will also be auctioned, the Bureau denied it, saying that it was only suggested once and did not become a reality.</p>

<h3>Cracking Down on Mid-Autumn Festival Gift-Giving: The Thrift Committee Implements Effectively</h3>
<p>The Mid-Autumn Festival is approaching. The Municipal Thrift Supervision Committee will hold a meeting in the coming days to implement thrift effectively. According to the "Shanghai New Year's Festival Gift-Giving Crackdown Measures" promulgated last year, gifts for the Mid-Autumn Festival will be cracked down on. This will be implemented for civil servants and teachers first. Those who violate these regulations will be advised or warned, and may be punished by the police. According to the person in charge of the Committee: During the Lunar Mid-Autumn Festival, it is a Chinese custom for both government officials and the general public to exchange gifts, which is a waste of money. This decadent social trend fosters a psychology of hypocrisy and flattery, which should be reformed. Leaders of government agencies, community organizations, and people from all walks of life should take the lead in launching a no-gift-giving and no-gift-receiving campaign.</p>

<h3>President Chiang Instructions on Promoting New Economic Measures; Completing Land Registration to Absorb Floating Capital; Central Government Determined to Suppress Prices; Mayor Wu Talks to Reporters After Returning to Shanghai</h3>
<p>[Our Report] Mayor Wu flew to Nanjing on the morning of the 4th after receiving a telegram from the President. After finishing his official business that evening, he returned to Shanghai by night train with Zhang Peter, the director of the Foreign Affairs Department of the Municipal Government. He got off at the North Station in the drizzle at 7:10 yesterday morning. Reporters drove to meet him. According to Wu, he was summoned to report to the President on the price and economic situation in Shanghai after the announcement of the financial and economic emergency decree. He met the President twice, and also visited President Weng and Secretary-General Li. He was originally scheduled to return to Shanghai on a 6 o'clock military plane, but was recalled by the President after arriving at the Xiaguan Railway Station. When asked about the reason for the President's recall, he replied that the President believed that Shanghai was full of floating capital after the implementation of the economic plan. In order to prevent it from causing trouble, he gave further instructions. The President also ordered to expedite the land transfer registration work to guide floating capital into the right track, as most of the pre-war floating capital was concentrated in real estate. When asked if there were other ways to channel floating capital, Wu said that there were many methods, but only this point could be disclosed. He also said that he would invite Zhu Ping, the director of the Land Administration Bureau, today to discuss active and elegant progress strategies. The Land Administration Bureau is expected to draft concrete measures first. The reporter also asked if the President had also inquired about the arrest of major merchants in the city. Wu replied that the President had known in advance. Regarding the suppression of prices this time, the Central Government has the greatest determination and will not hesitate to sacrifice the heads of corrupt merchants to uphold the law.</p>
<p>The reporter further informed the Mayor that it was rumored here that he was presenting his resignation to the President, and that his resignation had been approved. Wu replied urgently: "There is no such thing." The reporter continued to say that at a time of such rumors, the Mayor should make a statement and ask if he had already dismissed the idea of resigning. He replied: "The facts prove that I cannot resign at present."</p>

Chen spared no effort in his speeches and talks to describe the harm of totalitarianism to world peace and the great significance of China's suppression of bandits and civil unrest. He also spoke extensively about China's difficult efforts to remove obstacles to democratic constitutionalism and move towards the constitutional road of the Three People's Principles, which gave all parties a good and profound impression and influence. US aid was finally passed in the military obstacle. Chen's informal coordination, along with the efforts of Ambassador Gu and American friends, was very meticulous. During Chen's stay in the United States, except for the "Overseas Chinese Daily" run by the Chinese Communists in New York, which criticized him every day, nineteen American newspapers published his photos, speeches, and whereabouts with a friendly attitude. Before Chen and his wife left San Francisco to return to China, they were warmly welcomed and respected by overseas Chinese and American friends.</p>
<p>After Chen and his wife return to Shanghai, they will be warmly welcomed by people here. Relevant agencies and organizations in the city have scheduled a tea party at the Lidu Garden at 3:00 pm on the 7th to welcome Chen.</p>
<h3>A Corrupt Official in the Xu Jizhuang Case: Qi Zaiyu, Former Captain of the Garrison Headquarters' Inspection Brigade, Executed; Died After Three Shots; Will Wrote to Warn His Son Not to Become an Official</h3>
<p>[Our Report] Qi Zaiyu, the former captain of the Sixth Inspection Brigade of the Garrison Headquarters, was executed by firing squad at the Jiangwan shooting range at 9:15 yesterday morning for the crime of extortion and corruption. He died after three shots in the drizzle.</p>
<p>Qi's arrest was actually related to the sensational Xu Jizhuang corruption case this year. When the authorities were most closely pursuing Xu Jizhuang, Qi helped him hide in his residence, allowing him to escape to Hong Kong. After being reported, he was detained. After several months of investigation by the military court, he was finally sentenced to death and reported to the Ministry of National Defense and then to the President for review and approval.</p>
<p>When Qi Zaiyu was taken out of the Garrison Headquarters detention center at 8:00 yesterday morning, he was wearing a checkered short shirt and pants, white socks, and yellow leather shoes. He looked haggard. After Section Chief Zhu Cheng read the President's order, Qi's face turned pale, but he still pretended to be calm and requested permission to write a will to his wife and children. But when he finished writing three pages of letters, his hands were shaking uncontrollably. Before the execution, Qi drank a glass of sorghum wine and was injected with an anesthetic. Then his hands were tied behind his back and he was escorted to the execution ground by soldiers of the Special Service Company. He was dragged to the grass and executed by firing squad with a Type 38 rifle. A total of three shots were fired. The first shot hit the back of the neck. After two minutes, the second shot was fired. His legs and body were trembling non-stop, and he was still moaning. He died after the third shot. After the execution, the military court immediately notified Qi's wife by phone to collect the body.</p>
<h3>The Course of Two Corruption Cases</h3>
<p>Qi Zaiyu was 43 years old and from Jiaxing, Zhejiang. During the enemy-puppet period, he was ordered to host a secret radio station in Shanghai, which was quite successful. After the victory, he was transferred to the Shanghai North Inspection Section of the Inspection Office of the Garrison Headquarters. In the spring of the 36th year, the Action Team of the Inspection Office was reorganized, and Qi served as the captain of the Sixth Inspection Brigade. He was usually quite capable in his work, but he indulged in entertainment venues, contracted vulgar habits, and ended up in this situation. The revelation of Qi's corruption case stemmed from the Xu Jizhuang case. Qi often frequented singing and dancing halls and knew Xu's concubine Wang Baimei (formerly a Paramount dancer). After the Xu case broke out, Qi was ordered to handle it. Wang Baimei used private relations and money to lure Qi, who first hid Xu and then helped him disguise himself as a refugee and escape to Hong Kong. But the opportunity was not secret, and Xu Jizhuang's self-provided steam army was found in Qi's residence, and the matter was revealed. In addition to the Xu case, in December last year, Qi received a tip that Wu Baokang had hidden a large amount of enemy-puppet materials, including more than 10,000 radio square sheds and more than 100 military telephones, hidden on the third floor of No. 6 Lane 69 Yongqing Road. After Qi was approved, he ordered Chen Wenyu, a lieutenant inspector of the team, to lead people to arrest Wu Baokang and take him to the team on the morning of December 13 last year. The team's major inspector Zhou Wenyuan and others were responsible for interrogating and detaining him. Qi took the opportunity to extort 455 million yuan from Wu Baokang through Jin Runsheng, under the guise of a donation, as a cover-up, and as a bonus to distribute to his subordinates, in order to silence them. The case was also reported by the victim, and the Garrison Commander Xuan Tiewu ordered an investigation.</p>
<h3>Will</h3>
<p>The will Qi Zaiyu wrote to his wife and children yesterday morning was sad and the handwriting was scribbled. The content said: "This morning, I, Yu, was ordered to be executed. I have no time for everything. I am afraid you are still dreaming and have not woken up. This time, I was sentenced to death for violating the naval, army, and air force criminal law, and I was not given the opportunity to appeal. I am afraid it is difficult to accept. This time, I was ordered to be executed, and I have infinite emotion. After that, you should return to your hometown and live a hard life. […], educate well. (Omitted) There are several points to take care of. […] If you don’t study, you should return to your hometown to run a rice shop as soon as possible. You must not be an official in the future to avoid being wronged. Nannu Nanshan has been in my home for a long time. After that, he will still be at home, and everyone will treat him as family. Take care of your mother-in-law, who is old. After you return to your hometown, the residence on Kainalu Road can be returned to Yepu Real Estate Company. The lease contract is with Lawyer Ma Junsok. Everything can be entrusted to Lawyer Ma. The human relationship in Shanghai is bleak. Yu is usually sincere to people. Once something happens, few people take care of him, and it will be even more unimaginable in the future. (Omitted) At this moment, my heart is in a mess. I can't write anything. Take care of yourself. In the future, you can recite the Buddha in your hometown to seek Buddha's blessing. People in troubled times are worthless. One more thing, I heard that there is a new child in Changzhou. You can ask Xiuzhen, and maybe you can educate him in the future. Leave an ivory pen (fountain pen) as a souvenir. Qi Zaiyu's last words. September 5, 8:45 a.m."</p>
<h3>Many People Involved in the Qi Case; Two Convicts Sentenced to Five Years Each; Five Acquitted, the Rest Sent to the District Prosecutor's Office</h3>

<p>The Economic Control Inspection Committee Encourages Citizens to Report Violations Confidentially</p>
<p>The Shanghai District Inspection Committee of the Executive Yuan's Economic Control Committee issued a public announcement yesterday under the Shanghai Inspection Secret Character No. 1, stating: "This committee was formally established on September 2 and has begun operations at Room 410 of the Central Bank Building, undertaking economic inspection work in the Shanghai District.

<h3>Leather Merchant Couple Startled While Watching a Movie: Two Thieves Follow Them into Their Car and Rob Them in a Secluded Location</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] The Cathay Theatre on Rue Cardinal Mercier (today's Middle Huaihai Road) and Route Tenant de May (today's Maoming Road) is currently showing the movie "The Yearling", which has been a box office hit. At 8:45 PM last night, after the second showing ended, the audience filed out. Among them was Guan Shengkang, who runs a leather business and resides at 115 Nanjing West Road. He and his wife left the theater and were about to step into their private car at the corner outside the main entrance (the license plate number of the car is 03.9492), when two thieves suddenly appeared behind them, each brandishing a pistol. One thief jumped into the car compartment, and the other drove the car, heading east along Rue Cardinal Mercier, turning into 八仙橋, and then turning west into Route Paul Henry de Vries (today's Jinling Middle Road) towards the secluded area of Xujiahui. Using force, they robbed Guan's wife of her gold necklace, diamond ring, and cash in her wallet. Then, they turned the car around and headed east, near the Lyceum Theatre, where they forced Guan and his wife out of the car. As they left, they said, "If you want the car, look for it at the Great World." After Guan regained his composure, he reported the incident to the Lou Jia Wan Police Sub-Bureau. Chief Song, upon receiving the report, immediately dispatched a large number of police officers in patrol cars to search the area and notified other sub-bureaus to assist in the pursuit. More than two and a half hours later, the car was found in front of the 新華舞厅 next to the New Nanking Theatre west of the Great World on Avenue Edward VII (today's Middle Yan'an Road). After investigation by the police, it was handed over to the owner, Guan Shengkang, to drive back. Meanwhile, the pursuit of the escaped criminals continues.</p>
<h3>Insurance Industry Plans to Launch a Large-Scale Insurance Campaign to Channel Idle Funds and Cultivate Insurance Virtues</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] Since the currency reform, the insurance industry in this area is planning to launch a large-scale insurance campaign to channel idle funds in society and cultivate the virtues of insurance among the Chinese people. The planned projects include strengthening the existing insurance businesses such as reinsurance, marine insurance, fire insurance, and life insurance. In addition, new businesses such as national insurance and passenger insurance are planned to be added to life insurance, so that the insurance business will become increasingly socialized. Insurance industry insiders said that this campaign, in a backward society, still relies on the advocacy of the government and the assistance of leaders from all walks of life to achieve twice the result with half the effort.</p>
<p>Enabling Idle Funds to Find a Home</p>
<p>Luo Beichen, a leader in the insurance industry in this area, told reporters yesterday: "The insurance industry can enable idle funds to find two legitimate homes: (1) Production Funds: After absorbing funds, European and American insurance companies mostly invest in industries, mines, railways, and various development projects, which are purely production-oriented investments. (2) Social Funds: The principle of insurance is that the fortunate help the victims. Insurance premiums are for the benefit of the public who have suffered disasters in society, so as to compensate for their losses. Therefore, insurance funds are actually social funds."</p>
<p>Promoting Full Public Awareness</p>
<p>He said: "The United Kingdom has recently implemented social insurance, providing a certain degree of protection to every citizen from birth to burial. This is not impossible to do in our country, but our people lack a full understanding of insurance. However, the Ministry of National Defense is about to start military insurance, which is a combination of life insurance and accident insurance, and is also the beginning of social insurance. If the national insurance, passenger insurance, and travel insurance that the insurance industry in this area plans to actively promote can be expanded to include all citizens and travelers, the premiums collected per unit will become lower and lower, and citizens and travelers will be guaranteed everywhere." He hopes to invite insurance industry personnel in this area to jointly launch an insurance promotion campaign in the near future to promote the public's understanding of the insurance business.</p>
<h3>Zhang Yamin's Death Sentence Awaits Final Approval</h3>
<p>Zhang Yamin, Chief of the Economic Section of the Shanghai Garrison Headquarters, was sentenced to death for dereliction of duty and is awaiting final approval from the President before being formally executed. However, whether the execution will be carried out in Shanghai has not yet been decided. This is only a request from the Shanghai Garrison Headquarters, and there is no regulation that after a case is concluded in Beijing, the criminals must be handed over to the local authorities for execution. Therefore, a decision from the Ministry of National Defense is also required.</p>
<h3>Strict Control Measures for Dangerous Goods Under Review</h3>
<p>Following the fire at the 衆發 Warehouse, the authorities, in order to prevent similar incidents from occurring in warehouses in the future, have jointly formulated strict control measures for dangerous goods by the Police Bureau, the Public Works Bureau, and the Public Utilities Bureau. The measures place various restrictions on the storage of dangerous goods in warehouses and stipulate various necessary conditions, such as those related to construction and fire protection. Anyone intending to store dangerous and flammable goods must apply for registration in advance, undergo a detailed review, and then be issued a permit. Afterwards, personnel will be dispatched from time to time to investigate whether there is any possibility of danger. The above-mentioned control measures have been jointly submitted to the Municipal Council for discussion by the Police Bureau, the Public Works Bureau, and the Public Utilities Bureau, and it has been decided to send them to the Councilor's Office for review.</p>

<h3>Land Occupied by Longhua Airport: Landowners Petition for Unpaid Land Prices</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] During the enemy-puppet period, Longhua Airport occupied more than 5,000 mu of nearby civilian land. After the victory, it has not been returned. Previously, the Land Administration Bureau convened a meeting of the user agency and representatives of the landowners to discuss the method of negotiated purchase. Although an agreement was reached, it was not implemented. The landowner representatives, Cao Zhimin and others, petitioned the Civil Aviation Administration a few days ago, but did not receive a definite response. After discussion by the district residents, it was decided that District Councilor Zhang Xuelian would submit a document to the Executive Yuan, urging the competent authorities to allocate land prices as soon as possible to complete the negotiated purchase procedures, so as to avoid other disputes. It is also learned that the district residents will dispatch representatives to Beijing to petition in the shortest possible time in order to seek early repayment of land prices.</p>
<h3>Expansion of the Flying Fortress Structure</h3>

The day before yesterday, Hu's son from his previous marriage came to Shanghai from the countryside. Hu, because the room was small and inconvenient to live together, discussed with Wang A'bin the possibility of building a loft in his shared kitchen for his son to live in. Wang refused, and a quarrel ensued, followed by a physical altercation. Wang was punched by Hu several times. After mediation by others, they dispersed. Unexpectedly, Wang harbored resentment and bought a knife that day, hiding it on his person, intending to harm Hu. At around 11:00 AM yesterday, Hu suddenly went out and was spotted by Wang, who rushed up from behind and stabbed him once in the back with the knife before fleeing. Afterwards, Hu was sent to Hongren Hospital by his wife for treatment. Shortly after, Wang A'bao, the assailant, surrendered himself to the New City Police Sub-Bureau, admitting that he had stabbed Hu with a knife.</p>

<h3>The Young Air Force is Growing: Hu Weike Discusses the Foundation of Air Education</h3>
<p>— Special Correspondent Chu Yusheng</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Hangzhou, 2nd] On the day we celebrate Journalists' Day, it is also the anniversary of the cradle of the Iron Winged Eagles soaring in the skies of our motherland. This anniversary has special significance in Hangzhou, because the cradle of our Air Force is located at Jianqiao, near Hangzhou. The reporter's first report to readers is that this cradle of the Air Force—the Air Force Officer School—has been through nineteen winters and summers. This cradle of the Air Force has trained batches of aerial heroes, who are now spread throughout every corner of China, shouldering arduous tasks. And what about the cradle itself? Although it is facing high prices and a shortage of funds, it is constantly seeking progress. Especially in the past year or two, Principal Hu Weike has completed the Greening Jianqiao plan with the belief that "Hands are omnipotent, and man can conquer nature." They have planted more than 200,000 trees, all of which are growing vigorously. They have also completed more than 20 kilometers of circular roads around the school and more than 20 kilometers of circular canals around the school, connecting the center of the campus. At the same time, they have completed the necessary military equipment on the main transportation routes. In addition, they used bombs confiscated from the Japanese army to build a large-scale bomb platform to raise the awareness of the people in the school.</p>
<p>Building a Self-Reliance Village</p>
<p>Using the spirit of labor service, they completed the residences for the mechanics' families, named "Self-Reliance Village." What can be called a miracle is that they did not spend a single cent, but only used waste iron and cement from the school to build the highway-grade bridge "Jianqiao." The construction of this bridge has greatly increased the magnificence of the front gate of the Air Force School and saved more than 100 billion legal currency for the public treasury.</p>
<p>In addition to the original swimming pool and sports field, they have added a racetrack, a statue platform for Air Force warriors, a large fountain, a music stage, and a dancing venue.</p>
<p>In terms of production, they have established two farms. The products of the farms are supplied to all officers and students in the school at half the market price. In addition, there are utensil factories, tofu factories, and rice mills. The dregs left over from the tofu factory and rice mill can be used to feed pigs. There are also stables, cattle farms, and so on.</p>
<p>Now they are still actively engaged in afforestation. Most of the trees are fruit trees, so the strong men in the Air Force School will have endless good fortune in the future.</p>
<p>Aircraft Deployment</p>
<p>In the past two years, the number of aircraft deployed in the Air Force School has reached 10,390 times, with an average of 18 to 20 aircraft deployed every day. The number of aircraft repaired has reached 2,796. They do not have many aircraft, but they can deploy them so many times. This must be attributed to the efforts of the instructors of the school. They publish 17 kinds of publications. They also pay special attention to recreation, music, and recreational activities, with a total of more than 309 activities.</p>
<p>Many people think that the Air Force's treatment is much better than that of other troops. In fact, the Air Force requires first-class physical fitness and should pay special attention to nutrition. The Air Force's treatment in the United Kingdom and the United States also pays special attention to nutrition. However, now our Air Force instructors' treatment is equivalent to that of the Army, with just a little more flight allowance. Their students' meals consist of two vegetarian and three meat dishes. In June and July, they can't even eat fish. The taste of chicken and duck has long been forgotten, and fruit has long been cancelled.</p>
<p>New System of the Air Force School</p>
<p>Principal Hu Weike is a very hardworking and progressive person. Since he took office as the educational affairs officer of the Air Force Officer School, he resolutely shortened the length of education and reformed the educational system. The first batch of graduates produced under the new system, after being assigned to various troops, were found to be particularly satisfactory by the troop leaders. Through his efforts, he was able to overcome the financial difficulties.</p>
<p>Now, in the skies above Hangzhou, there are often groups of new types of training aircraft. These training aircraft are PT-17s, which are made in China. Since China made these aircraft, many people still doubt their performance, and even doubt whether they can take off without crashing. Principal Hu Weike and the instructors in their school went to the aircraft manufacturing plant. Principal Hu first test flew the aircraft, and then confirmed that the aircraft had its strong performance. Then, groups of new aircraft were driven back to the Air Force Officer School. Now our aircraft manufacturing plants in China are constantly working overtime to build aircraft to meet the needs of our young Air Force.</p>
<p>Large Formation Performance</p>
<p>On September 1st, in addition to holding a celebration meeting, they also held a large formation performance of aircraft. The aircraft performed were all made in China. In addition, there were water sports games, concerts, and dances. After the concert, there was a large dinner party. Chinese and American Air Forces raised their glasses to celebrate, and the excitement was intense. They joyfully spent the school anniversary celebration day.</p>
<p>The Era of Air Power</p>
<p>I talked with Principal Hu about how to build a strong Air Force. He said: "There is only one school for the education of Air Force officers. In the vast airspace of our motherland, this is naturally not enough. At the same time, the foundation of the Chinese Air Force is still built on the bodies of the people. The Chinese people are weak and do not meet the conditions for the Air Force, which is also an obstacle to the expansion of a strong Air Force."</p>
<p>In the future, air sports will be particularly frequent, because air traffic will shorten the space-time of the world a lot, so countries without a strong aerial talent will be ridiculed by others forever. The future is the era of air power, and our people should make the necessary preparations and cooperate with air education, so that we can catch up with the era of air power.</p>
<h3>Shaoxing Unscrupulous Merchants Transport Rice to Bandits, Food Department Cables Zhejiang Provincial Government to Investigate and Reply</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 4th] Reports state that unscrupulous speculators in Shaoxing, Zhejiang Province, disregarding the people's livelihood, secretly transported rice and wheat out to sea to supply the Communist bandits.

<h3>The Strange Corpse in South Chang'an Street, Beiping, is the Orderly Cai Yongquan; The Cause of Death May Be a Scandal</h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper in Beiping, 5th] The strange corpse case in South Chang'an Street was published in this newspaper on August 30. The strange corpse was named Cai Yongquan, who was an orderly of Wang Huanting, the owner of the downstairs room at No. 1 South Garden. Wang is the Deputy Director of the Investigation Department of the Tianjin Garrison. Cai had a very deep affection for Wang's daughter, Wang Shuhua, and had privately given Cai Yongquan a self-embroidered handkerchief, and they had also taken a photo together. Cai was dismissed around August of last year. A year later, he suddenly disappeared in April of this year. Now, a strange corpse was found on the roof of the Wang family's house. According to his elder brother, Cai Yuquan's identification, it may be Cai Yongquan. The background may also be a complicated and serious scandal. When the police chief Zhao Zhengping, who discovered the strange corpse, went upstairs to examine the body, he also found a bullet casing, so Cai may have been shot to death. Cai's brother, Yuquan, in addition to sending all the evidence to the District Court for investigation, urgently telegraphed Cai's uncle, Cai Shengshan, who is the Deputy Section Chief of the General Affairs Section of the Police Bureau in Shanghai, asking him to redress his brother's grievances.</p>
<h3>Miniature News</h3>
<p>Chongqing</p>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] The old and new streets of Chuanping Xiningyun were completely destroyed by a major fire on the 2nd, with losses of more than a hundred houses, worth more than 200 billion legal currency. The cause was that the Xiningyun Center Reclamation Agency sold to the Changying Reclamation Agency, which was dissatisfied by the Anti-Construction Agency and set the fire. The victims have sent representatives to the county government to petition, demanding the sealing of the property of Lu Zhenhua, the manager of Anti-Construction, because when the fire broke out, the Anti-Construction Agency sent teams to monitor and prevent people from rescuing.</p>
<p>Nanjing</p>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] The Jiangxi Sojourners' Association in Nanjing is launching a fundraising campaign in Nanjing for flood relief and has negotiated with the famous actress Tong Zhiling, who has agreed to perform in Shanghai to raise funds. The association has telegraphed the provincial government to request that funds that can be temporarily diverted be used for emergency relief first, and has contacted relevant central agencies to request the allocation of emergency relief, flood prevention, and agricultural loans.</p>
<h3>On the Eve of the Autumn Harvest, Nantong Cotton Production Increases by One-Third</h3>
<p>— Our reporter Cong Yongshu</p>
<p>[Fast report from our newspaper, Nantong, 3rd] In another half a month, cotton will be on the market. The cotton merchants who have been resting for a short period will once again revitalize.</p>
<p>It is estimated that the cotton planting area in Nantong this year has increased by more than 100,000 mu, and the yield has also increased correspondingly. It is estimated that cotton production may increase by more than 10,000 shi dan, which is close to one-third of last year's total production.</p>
<p>"Chicken Feet" Cotton Merchants Purchase</p>
<p>Nantong has always been one of the important cotton producing areas in our country. The quality of cotton has always been quite good. Later, "Chicken Feet" cotton was tried, and after multiple improvements, it has become a common cotton variety in Nantong area today. Because the cotton here can be used to spin 20-count fine yarn, Jiangnan manufacturers such as China Textile, Xin Shen, and Cotton and Linen, in previous years, sent specialists or entrusted merchants here to purchase cotton when the cotton was on the market, bidding each other up and even rushing to buy goods regardless of quality. This news of a sharp increase in cotton production this year will definitely be noticed by these manufacturers.</p>
<p>Last year, the cotton planting area in Nantong was 900,500 mu, of which about 200,000 mu were planted with American cotton, and the rest were still planted with Chinese cotton. In terms of yield, American cotton yielded more than Chinese cotton. On average, each mu of American cotton can yield 24 jin of seed cotton, while Chinese cotton can only yield 28.8 jin. Therefore, the total seed cotton production last year was 269,744 shi dan. This year, the cotton planting area has increased to 1,080,000 mu, and the output is estimated at 385,662 shi dan, an increase of 115,888 shi dan compared to last year.</p>
<p>Dai Character Cotton Achieves Excellent Results</p>
<p>The Tongfu Cotton Planting Guidance Area has further promoted the Dai character cotton variety here after the restoration and has achieved excellent results. According to statistics from the area, this year, the new promotion area covers 12,418 mu. In addition, there are farmers who have retained or automatically exchanged the Dai character cotton seeds promoted last year, totaling 59,000 mu. Altogether, the area planted with Dai character cotton totals 71,418 mu. Although there has been a great promotion, it only accounts for one-fifteenth of the cotton planting area this year. Greater efforts are needed to promote this excellent cotton variety throughout the region.</p>
<p>Two Major Reasons for Increased Production</p>
<p>The reasons for the possible increase in cotton production in Nantong this year are, first, the increase in the cotton planting area. The main reason why the cotton planting area can be increased is that cotton prices have been higher in the past nine years. Before the war, roughly one dan of cotton could be worth three shi of rice, but last year it had risen to five shi of rice to be worth one dan of cotton, and the current cotton price is not far from this ratio. When farmers see this situation, they naturally intend to abandon planting food crops and switch to planting cotton. The second reason is the suitable climate. After sowing in early summer this year, the rainfall was very harmonious, and the cotton plants developed very well. The autumn weather is also very good, which is very beneficial for the flowering and boll formation of cotton.</p>
<p>However, these are all from a favorable perspective. If we look carefully at the vast wilderness, it is still a question whether the abundant cotton production in the areas harassed by roaming bandits can be controlled by us. On the eve of this autumn harvest, I hope that the self-defense forces can exert some strength and strive for this huge amount of material.</p>
<p>Widespread Production Increase in Northern Jiangsu</p>
<p>The total cotton field area in northern Jiangsu today has also increased significantly, and cotton production has also increased accordingly. According to statistics, the cotton fields in 12 counties including Nantong, Haimen, Qidong, Chongming, Funing, Yancheng, Dongtai, Baoying, Gaoyou, Xinghua, Rugao, and Changshu in southern Jiangsu total 4,146,132 mu, an increase of 635,891 mu compared with last year. Cotton production also increased from 1,053,737 shi dan to 1,264,244 shi dan. Among them, the cotton production of Chongming, Baoying, and Gaoyou counties last year was 29,606 dan, and the survey figures have not yet been included this year. On the whole, the output of various counties has increased, only Yancheng has slightly decreased due to repeated harassment by bandit troops.</p>
<p>Gansu Province Implements Land Reform</p>
<p>[Report from our newspaper, Lanzhou, 4th] Gansu Province initially selected Gaotai and Qingyang counties to implement land reform, but after reconsideration by the Provincial Government, Yongdeng and Yuzhong counties were also included. The total cost for September and December of this year is more than 52,000 gold yuan. It is estimated that the entire plan can be completed in two years and six months to eight months. The "Work Plan for Supporting Self-cultivating Farmers" drafted by the Provincial Government will be implemented after the Executive Yuan approves the allocation of funds.</p>
<h3>A Special Record of Smuggling Grain from Taiwan</h3>
<p>— Our Special Correspondent Wu Shourren</p>
<p>[Airmail from our newspaper, Taipei, 3rd] The situation of armed smuggling of grain from Taiwan has been recorded in the previous article. Here is another example: The case is like this: In March of this year, Chen Kunlai, the owner of Zhenfeng Bank, a grain merchant in Taipei, applied to the Grain Bureau for permission to transport 1,000 bags of white rice (equivalent to 10,000 shi jin) to Penghu to relieve the grain shortage. Penghu is a group of small islands in the western sea of Taiwan. Although it is not a barren land, it does not produce a single grain of rice. It can only produce a little corn, and the residents also have a population of 70,000 to 80,000. The annual food needs are entirely supplied by the main island of Taiwan. Therefore, the Provincial Government specially allows grain merchants to operate grain sales to Penghu.</p>
<p>The Course of the Grain Ship Changes, However, the grain ship has to pass through the sea, and the destination of the voyage is controlled by the grain merchants. Who can guarantee that they will not change the direction of the rudder once they leave the port? Therefore, in order to thoroughly implement the ban, the Provincial Government has also formulated a rule: that is, grain merchants transporting grain to Penghu must obtain a permit from the Grain Bureau, and when exporting, they must issue a guarantee to the customs with a guarantee from a reputable shop. After arriving in Penghu, they must also obtain a certificate from the police station in the unloading area and send it back to the customs for inspection before completing the legal procedures. At that time, when the Grain Bureau received Zhenfeng Bank's application to transport 1,000 bags of rice to Penghu, it was precisely when Penghu was experiencing a grain shortage and urgently reported to the Provincial Government, so it easily issued a permit and stipulated that the shipment must be made on March 3, and it would be invalid if overdue. The Tainan Customs only received the customs declaration on March 4. A motorized sailboat named Ruicheng was loaded with 1,000 bags of rice, with a permit from the Grain Bureau and a guarantee from Lian Da Bank. The procedures were impeccable and of course, it was released. Only waiting for the certificate from the police station in the unloading area to arrive, this transaction could be concluded.</p>
<p>So-Called Return Certificate is All Forged. Sure enough, on March 5, the Tainan Customs received the certificate from the Xiyu Police Station in Penghu sent by the people transporting the rice, stating that the Ruicheng motor vessel had unloaded 1,000 bags of rice in Xiyu, but for some reason, the staff of the Tainan Customs suspected the authenticity of the return certificate, so they sent the original return certificate to the Xiyu Police Station for inquiry. Unfortunately, the Xiyu Police Station's reply confirmed this suspicion. The so-called return certificate was originally forged.</p>
<p>The Signboard is a Dummy and the Shop Disappears. The Tainan Customs launched an investigation. First, they looked for the guarantor of Lian Da Bank, but the shop of Lian Da Bank had disappeared. According to the landlord of the original address, someone temporarily requested to hang up this signboard, but it was taken down in just two or three days, and the person who ordered the signboard was also nowhere to be found. Obviously, this was a well-planned smuggling case. The Tainan Customs reported it to the Ministry of Finance. In early June, the Ministry of Finance consulted the Provincial Government and ordered the Grain Bureau to investigate. The Grain Bureau transferred the entire file to the Taipei District Court Prosecutor's Office for investigation. The facts seem very obvious. The key to the problem should be the Zhenfeng Bank that applied for transportation, but Chen Kunlai, the owner of Zhenfeng Bank, argued that he did not know about this matter at all, and that the Cambodian Kang Zhang and private seals were not forged, but were stolen by someone unknown. Everyone hoped that the Ruicheng motor vessel could come back again and be caught, so before and after the case, they always kept the secret, until now, this is still an undiscovered secret news.</p>

<p>Weekly Economy</p>
<h3>General Prices: Strengthening Control and Strictly Enforcing Price Limits</h3>
<p>Since the promulgation of the Emergency Decree for Finance and Economy, in the second week after the issuance of the Gold Yuan, the authorities, with firm will, have strengthened the implementation of economic control and strictly enforced price limits. Under this situation, merchants dare not test the law and openly violate the law, so the market also has few special reactions. However, due to the excessive flooding of floating capital, the authorities have not yet formulated effective guidance measures, which is somewhat of a hidden worry for the current prices. It is estimated that the floating capital congestion in the market last week was more than 50 million Gold Yuan. The cause of this will be discussed in the next section of this publication. Because of the flooding of floating capital, the black market interest rate dropped sharply, once falling to as low as 4.5%, falling below the officially set interest rate. Bank deposits have therefore also increased significantly, totaling 6 million Gold Yuan, an increase of about 60% compared to before.</p>
<p>Market Transactions Demand More Than Supply</p>
<p>The price trend in the commodity market last week was not very normal, because under the strict control of the authorities, trading above the 819 price limit was illegal, and trading within the 819 price limit would inevitably result in losses due to cost reasons.</p>
<p>The yarn and cloth market, for example, formed a situation of sparse transactions, with very little business being done. Popular yarns such as Blue Phoenix and Double Horse were rarely traded, with only a few assortments and miscellaneous brands being sold. The quoted price for Dragon Head Fine Cloth stood firmly at the涨限 of 29.5 yuan, and the prices of other cloths also mostly stood at涨限, with demand exceeding supply, and the market was in a state of semi-shutdown. However, due to actual needs, there were those who exchanged goods for goods, roughly using 4 Gentleman Yuan Serge for 1 Yuan to offset the standard for Dragon Head Fine Cloth.</p>
<p>120 Count Sky Bridge Silk also consistently stood at the price limit of 1,133.3 yuan, with very little business being done.</p>
<p>In terms of food, due to the soft prices in the producing areas and flat outflows, the price of white粳 in the North Market in this city stood at 21 yuan at the weekend. Due to the Social Bureau's prohibition of old stock trading before the end of August and the limit order to appear within 7 days, the price of flour once retreated to 6.5 yuan, and returned to 7 yuan and 3.5 cents at the weekend. Miscellaneous grains and edible oil mostly stood at the fixed price limit, with scarce supply. For example, the price of Qingdao Jitong Raw Oil stood as high as 64 yuan. Among daily necessities, such as cigarettes, some tobacco shops sold them with a limit of one pack, and there were anecdotes about tearing the carton to avoid resale.</p>
<p>Various Industries State the Difficulties of Price Limits</p>
<p>The implementation of price limits in this city has reached two weeks as of the end of last week. Mr. Jiang Jingguo, who is responsible for supervising economic control, has given speeches to various industries and listened to opinions. According to the analysis of the grievances stated by various industries, they are roughly no more than the following points:</p>
<p>First: Due to the increase in costs, price limits are difficult to maintain. For example, the wine and food industry complained that since the 19th, fish, meat, chicken, duck, vegetables, etc. have frequently increased in price. If the industry is to maintain price compensation, the prices of various raw materials must be suppressed and maintained in accordance with the price limits.</p>
<p>Second: Due to the increase in donations and taxes, price limits are affected. For example, the sauce and wine industry representative pointed out that after the currency reform, the salt tax suddenly increased, affecting the cost of soy sauce and salted goods. The fresh pork industry stated that due to increased transportation costs, slaughter taxes, health inspection fees, and the pacification of northern Jiangsu, it is difficult to maintain price limits.</p>
<p>Third: Due to the high ex-factory prices, it is difficult to maintain price limits. The cotton cloth industry stated that, such as fine cloth, the current distribution price of China Textile for the industry is 29 yuan and 3 cents, and the price limit is 29 yuan and 5 cents. The profit seems to be 2 cents, but the business tax alone needs to be paid 9 cents, plus a few days of interest, freight, etc., which is unbearable. The cigarette industry also said that cigarette factories distribute less goods, and what is sold cannot be replenished, and the source is in danger of being cut off.</p>
<p>Fourth: Due to the relationship between supply and demand, prices fluctuate slightly. The vegetable industry reported that the industry is entirely for customer sales, and cannot be hoarded or speculated. After the 23rd, the price was slightly higher due to weather and rain. It is hoped that the government will provide convenience in transportation and reduce costs.</p>
<p>Fifth: Due to the loose organization, it is difficult to control. For example, the tree firewood industry said that many colleagues in the industry have joined the guild and illegally engage in black market transactions, which is very difficult to control.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Industrial and Commercial Association Index Compilation Instructions</h3>
<p>(1) This association was established in November 1946. There was no collection of price materials during the Anti-Japanese War, so the compiled index temporarily starts from January 1946. Because many inland industries were in the process of moving east in the first few months after the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, and production had not yet returned to normal for a while, it started calculating from January of last year.</p>
<p>(2) In 1946, the index was compiled once a month, based on the wholesale prices on the 5th, 15th, and 25th of each month. From 1947 onwards, it is compiled once a week, based on the average wholesale prices from Monday to Friday of each week. Because the weekly index compiled by this association must be compiled on Saturday, the price materials used can only be up to Friday.</p>
<p>(3) This association compiles a total of three types of indexes: one is the Shanghai wholesale price index classified according to the use of goods, the second is the Shanghai wholesale price index classified according to the degree of processing, and the third is the Shanghai wholesale price index classified according to import and export goods.</p>
<p>(4) This association uses the entire year of 1936 as the base period for compiling the index. This is because in 1937, it was already facing war, and North China had entered an extraordinary situation. The political and economic situation was no longer as stable as in peacetime, so it was not suitable to be selected as the base period.</p>
<p>(5) The compilation of ordinary indexes uses 100 as the base number, but recently the price is more than 100,000 times higher than the base period, so 1 is used as the base number for convenience. As shown in the table below, the food index for the fourth week of November this year is 75,305, which means that the average price of food this week is 75,305 times the average price for the entire year of 1936.</p>
<p>(6) The three types of indexes compiled by this association all use the simple geometric average method. The compilation of the index is of course more detailed with weighted calculation. However, under the current situation of extreme scarcity of statistical data in our country, the collection of weights is extremely difficult. Only the trading volume of various types of goods can be used for reference, and the weighting effect is implicitly included in the selection and abandonment of various types of goods. Therefore, the number of goods included in each category is not the same.</p>
<p>(7) Since January 1947, the monthly index has been calculated by the simple geometric average method using the weekly indexes of the same month.</p>
<p>(8) Due to the limited space in this edition, it is impossible to publish all the indexes in each issue, so they can only be published in rotation. For example, the first issue publishes the Shanghai wholesale price index classified according to the use of goods, from January 1946 to the fourth week of November this year. The second issue after the week publishes the Shanghai wholesale price index classified according to the degree of processing, from 1936 to the first week of December this year, but at this time, the complete figures of the index classified according to the use of goods will no longer be published, only the various figures and the total index of this type of index in the first week of December will be published. The third issue after two weeks publishes the Shanghai wholesale price index classified according to import and export, from January 1946 to the second week of December this year, and also publishes the various figures and total index of the above two types of indexes in the second week of December, no longer publishing all the figures after 1946.</p>
<p>(9) In order to make it easier for readers to understand the actual situation of price fluctuations, a指　曲綫圖 is attached to each index table. However, due to the limited space, only one figure can be attached each time. There are many methods for drawing物價指数曲綫圖. In order to make it easier for readers to compare the trend of price fluctuations of various types of goods and compare the multiples of the price increase of various types of goods relative to the base period at the same time, this association draws several index curves on the same graph. For example, the index compiled according to the use of goods has a total of seven categories, plus the total index, there are a total of eight curves. It will be too blurred to combine the eight curves on the same graph, so only four are selected, and the rest can only be published later.</p>
<p>(10) The numbers listed on the left of the curve chart are the indexes. But it is arranged in the order of its logarithm. For example, the logarithm of the index 1,000 is three, the logarithm of the index 10,000 is four, and the logarithm of the index 100,000 is five. The vertical distance from the index 1,000 to 10,000 is equal to the vertical distance from 10,000 to 100,000. The ratio of the price increase multiples of the two end points of two sets of points with equal vertical distance on the curve is equal.</p>
<p>(11) The horizontal axis of the curve chart represents time, in months.</p>
<p>(12) After the currency reform in August 1948, from the first week of September, the Gold Yuan was calculated according to the law of 3 million 法幣 合 one, and the compilation method remained the same.</p>
<p>(Note) This explanation has been published in the newspaper once before. Because there are frequent inquiries from all parties about the compilation method, it is re-added, revised, and published as above.</p>

<h3>Monetary Finance</h3>
<p>(1) Undisclosed Interest Rates due to Loose Monetary Policy</p>
<p>The urgent need to tighten the loose monetary policy: Last week, the authorities attempted to address the loose monetary environment by reforming the currency, but this has not had any restraining effect. This is naturally a result of the excess of floating capital in the market. The reasons for the abundance of floating capital are still due to: (1) The exchange of gold, silver, and foreign currencies for gold yuan notes. (2) The government's substantial payments for the procurement of materials. (3) Due to political pressure, there are few loan requests, causing bank deposits to increase while lending decreases. (4) The indefinite postponement of the stock exchange opening, leaving floating capital with no outlet. Although the government has decided to sell materials and state-owned enterprises, such as over ten thousand boxes of artificial silk (worth ten million yuan), China Textile Industries' issuance of 1.3 million shares (worth 390 million yuan), and the disposal of 200,000 tons of surplus U.S. military supplies (worth 150 million yuan), these decisions are still in the planning stage and have no practical impact on tightening the loose monetary situation last week.</p>
<p>The destination of floating capital is noteworthy: One phenomenon is particularly noteworthy. It is reported that from the second half of last week, interbank lending rates have gradually returned to normal, allegedly due to clients competing to purchase goods. If floating capital, lacking other outlets, ultimately targets goods, it would be deeply disappointing. Furthermore, there are indications that floating capital is flowing to other cities, possibly due to looser regulations and lower prices in those areas. If this is the case, the subsequent consequence may be the outflow of goods, which would undoubtedly add further upward pressure on prices in this city. It is evident that ceasing the creation of floating capital and guiding its flow are matters of utmost urgency.</p>
<p>Significant inflows to government banks cast a shadow on the future: Last week, from Monday to Friday, the clearing results of national banks and government-owned banks showed a net inflow of over 3,563,000 yuan, a significant increase compared to the net outflow of over 5,000,000 yuan during the same period of the previous week. In today's environment of excessive floating capital, this is undoubtedly a positive sign. However, recalling the "one out, one in" policy implemented before the currency reform, while highly profitable, it was this repeated process that ultimately led to the demise of the legal tender. The controllers of the gold yuan must take heed of this lesson! Last week, foreign banks reversed the previous week's trend and recorded a significant net inflow. From Monday to Friday, the total net inflow was 366,952 yuan, an increase of over 1.1 million yuan compared to the same period of the previous week.</p>
<p>The potential of floating capital should not be underestimated: Last week's undisclosed interest rates were generally around 7 per month, with some falling to as low as 3. Subsidized interest rates for lending were only 2-3 yuan per day, equivalent to 6-9 per month. Bank liquidity was generally relaxed, with interbank lending virtually nonexistent. Some banks even refused to accept large customer deposits, indicating the extent of the excess liquidity. Bank deposit rates were lowered repeatedly last week, with deposit rates at 2.4 and lending rates at 1.10 on Monday, and interbank rates at 6. On Wednesday, deposit rates were lowered to 2.1, lending rates to 0.09, and interbank rates to 4.5. However, on Friday, deposit and interbank rates returned to Monday's levels, possibly due to increased trading activity and slightly improved demand for loans. The potential of floating capital should not be underestimated!</p>
<p>The clearing results for banks after number 60, from Monday to Friday, showed a total outflow of 3,644,000 yuan. Deducting the Taiwan Bank's net outflow of 230,100 yuan over five days, the actual net outflow between commercial banks was 3,413,900 yuan, an increase of over 3.8 million yuan compared to the same period of the previous week. This is also a sign that floating capital is seeking an outlet!</p>
<p>(2) Domestic and Foreign Exchange Rates</p>
<p>Last week, exchange rates in Shanghai commercial banks remained stable. The Guangzhou exchange rate remained unchanged at 20 yuan before Wednesday but suddenly increased to 50 yuan on Friday, possibly due to increased remittances. The Xiamen exchange rate remained at 20 yuan before Friday.</p>
<p>The Chongqing exchange rate decreased, starting at 60 yuan on Monday, dropping to 40 yuan on Tuesday and Wednesday, and then further to 20 yuan on Friday. The Wuhan exchange rate remained stable, starting at 60 yuan on Monday, dropping to 40 yuan on Tuesday, and remaining unchanged thereafter.</p>
<p>The Tianjin exchange rate trended upwards, starting at 10 yuan on Monday, rising to 20 yuan on Tuesday, and then increasing by another 10 yuan on Friday. This is a significant departure from the phenomenon of Tianjin exchange rates frequently trading at a discount before the currency reform.</p>
<p>Last week, there were continued transactions in foreign exchange settlements, with prices around 3.85 yuan and 3.75 yuan. Gold prices in jewelry stores remained unchanged, but the industry only sold 70% fineness gold, resulting in sluggish trading. Hong Kong gold prices fell, from 290 HKD per tael on Tuesday to 284 HKD on Thursday. The closing price of U.S. dollars in Hong Kong on Thursday was 5.05 HKD, nearly a dime lower than the opening price, reportedly due to the collapse of a certain bank. The sluggishness of gold prices is attributed to the excessive supply from Macau.</p>
<h3>The Supervisory Committee Officially Announces the Amount of Gold Yuan Notes Issued: 296,817,201.4 Yuan</h3>
<p>[Our Report] The amount of gold yuan notes issued was officially announced today in the first inspection announcement by the Gold Yuan Note Issuance Reserve Supervisory Committee. From August 23rd to the end of August this year, the amount of gold yuan notes issued nationwide was 296,817,201.4 yuan.</p>
<p>The committee, led by Chairman Li Ming, published its first inspection announcement in various newspapers today (see our advertising column), stating: In accordance with the Gold Yuan Note Issuance Regulations, the committee conducted an inspection of the gold yuan note issuance reserve at the Issuance Bureau of the Central Bank on August 31, 1948. The results of the inspection are announced as follows: (1) Amount of issuance: As detailed in the first paragraph. (2) Reserves: 40% in cash reserve, including 593,634.40235 ounces of gold, equivalent to US$20,777,204.07, converted to 83,100,816.28 gold yuan. 12,720,737.2570 ounces of silver, equivalent to US$8,904,516.075, converted to 35,618,064.3 gold yuan. (3) 60% in guaranteed reserves, including 200 million gold yuan in China Textile Industries stock.</p>
<p>The reserves that the committee should hold, as announced by the Executive Yuan, include (1) US$200 million in gold, silver, and foreign exchange, which have been handed over to the committee by the National Bank and are held by the Issuance Bureau in accordance with the organizational regulations. (2) Receipts and lists of state-owned enterprise stocks and enemy/puppet property worth US$300 million have been transferred to the committee. The reserve for the 296,817,201.4 yuan of gold yuan notes issued this time is a part of the total amount received and held by the committee. This announcement is hereby made.</p>
<h3>The Central Bank Revises Regulations on Overseas Remittances</h3>
<p>To support the new measures and accelerate the absorption of overseas remittances, the Central Bank has revised its regulations on overseas remittances. In areas with the largest amounts of overseas remittances, such as Hong Kong, Shantou, Xiamen, Wuzhou, and Fuzhou, the Business Bureau of the Central Bank has entrusted the four bank groups, China, Communications, Farmers, and China Trust, to act as collection agencies, with the Central Bank advancing funds. Overseas remittance handling fees are also waived. It is learned that the two methods of entrusted collection have been announced.</p>
<p>Methods for Entrusting the China, Communications, Farmers, and China Trust Banks in Shantou, Xiamen, Wuzhou, and Fuzhou to Collect Overseas Remittances:</p>
<p>(1) When people sell overseas remittances to these banks, the banks can, upon presentation of a telegram certificate from their respective Shanghai branches verifying the sale to the Central Bank, withdraw gold yuan from the local branch of the Central Bank.</p>
<p>(2) After making the payment, the local branch of the Central Bank will debit the Central Bank's account and immediately notify the collecting bank and the amount withdrawn, stating that the foreign exchange was purchased locally.</p>
<p>(3) Upon receiving the telegram, the Central Bank will credit the overseas remittance account of the Shantou, Xiamen, Wuzhou, and Fujian banks. The balance in this account can only be cleared with gold yuan obtained from the purchase of foreign exchange.</p>
<p>(4) Upon receiving the telegram, the Shanghai branches of these banks will sell the overseas remittances collected by their respective branches to the Central Bank, and the resulting gold yuan will be credited to the banks' overseas remittance accounts to repay the funds withdrawn from the local branch of the Central Bank.</p>
<p>(5) The portion of overseas remittances collected in foreign currency banknotes will continue to be handled in accordance with the Central Bank's regulations for entrusting these banks to exchange foreign currency banknotes, with a handling fee of 0.25%.</p>
<p>(6) The handling fee for the banks' inward foreign exchange, whether D.D. or T.T., is uniformly calculated at 0.5%.</p>
<p>(7) The foreign exchange collected by these banks should be converted into gold yuan at the prescribed exchange rate and paid to the overseas Chinese, without any increase or decrease.</p>
<p>(8) The Guangzhou branch of the Central Bank can buy and sell foreign exchange locally. The remittances collected by these banks in Guangzhou can be sold to the Guangzhou branch of the Central Bank at any time. Apart from applying the handling fee specified above, the other provisions above do not need to be applied.</p>
<p>Methods for Entrusting the China, Communications, and Farmers Banks and China Trust Bureau in Hong Kong to Collect Overseas Remittances:</p>
<p>(1) The gold yuan needed by these banks in Hong Kong to pay for overseas remittances will be allocated by the Central Bank from the payment locations for overseas remittances, as follows:</p>
<p>A. The Central Bank will notify its branches in Xiamen, Shantou, Wuzhou, Guangzhou, and Fuzhou in advance that the local China, Communications, Farmers, and China Trust Banks can, upon presentation of a telegram certificate from their respective Hong Kong branches, withdraw gold yuan from the local branch of the Central Bank to pay for overseas remittances. The local branch of the Central Bank should prioritize these payments. However, this withdrawal cannot be repaid locally.</p>
<p>B. After making the payment, the local branch of the Central Bank will debit the Central Bank's account and immediately notify the collecting bank and the amount withdrawn, stating that the foreign exchange was purchased in Hong Kong.</p>
<p>C. Upon receiving the telegram, the Central Bank will credit the overseas remittance account of the Hong Kong banks. The balance in this account can only be cleared with gold yuan obtained from the purchase of foreign exchange.</p>
<p>D. The foreign exchange collected by the Hong Kong banks should be telegraphed to their respective Shanghai branches for sale to the Central Bank on the same day, and the resulting gold yuan will be used to credit the banks' overseas remittance accounts to repay the debt.</p>
<p>(2) The handling fee for these banks to collect overseas remittances is calculated at 0.25% for foreign currency banknotes and 0.5% for DD and D-T.</p>
<p>(3) The foreign currency banknotes collected are limited to U.S. dollars and Hong Kong dollars. Temporarily, in accordance with the statutory exchange rate, each U.S. dollar is converted to 4 gold yuan, and each Hong Kong dollar is converted to 0.75 gold yuan and paid to the overseas Chinese, without any increase or decrease.</p>

<h3>Illiterate Citizens Account for Half of the City's Population; Literacy Education Needs to Be Promoted Urgently; Intellectuals Will Be Mobilized to Participate in Eradicating Illiteracy</h3>
<p>[Our Report] Illiterate citizens in this city account for nearly half of the total population, and the literacy movement needs to be actively promoted. However, to achieve practical results in this work, sufficient funding and comprehensive implementation are necessary. It is learned that the city's Education Bureau has formulated a general outline for promoting mass literacy: targeting illiterate citizens aged 15 to 50, focusing on the recognition and application of basic characters, supplemented by life skills and basic national knowledge. In terms of teaching: teachers and schools will adapt to the learners, adopting different methods based on the living environment of the citizens. Textbooks, films, and broadcasts will be used as teaching tools. Teaching venues will make full use of schools at all levels, government agencies, factories, shops, and public places in neighborhoods and shantytowns. In addition to the city's primary and secondary school teachers, social education workers, and senior elementary school students, teachers will also be recruited from faculty and students of specialized colleges and universities, in order to mobilize the city's intellectuals to participate in eradicating illiteracy. In terms of organization: a Municipal Mass Literacy Movement Committee will be established, chaired by the mayor, to coordinate planning and implementation.</p>

<h3>Guangxia Commercial College to Hold Entrance Exam on the 20th</h3>

<h3>Assistance for Education Basketball, Second Day: Ta Kung's Subpar Performance Leads to Loss Against Ch'i Ch'i; Jen Yu Defeats Shan Team in a One-Sided Match; Final Two Games Tonight</h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent] Despite boasting two world-class representatives, the Ta Kung basketball team performed unexpectedly poorly last night. In the charity basketball tournament for education aid, they were surprisingly defeated by the Ch'i Ch'i team, recently tied with Morning Friends, by a score of 59 to 49, a difference of ten points. This greatly surprised the fans. The competition was exceptionally fierce, with Ch'i Ch'i's defense being tight and their movements quite intense. At halftime, Ch'i Ch'i led 32 to 24. In another match, Jen Yu, leading from start to finish, easily defeated the Shan team by 40 to 35. At halftime, Jen Yu led 20 to 10, ahead by ten points. The charity ball was auctioned off, with Li Ya-ku purchasing it for 500 Gold Yuan. Ticket sales for last night totaled 930 yuan.</p>
<p>Jen Yu Leads All the Way At 7:00 PM, Jen Yu and the Shan team took to the court. Le Chia-chou scored two free throws, opening the scoring. Little Wu then put in a shot under the basket, and Peng Ju added another, giving Jen Yu a 6-0 lead. The Shan team called a timeout. Although Ch'ing Chiang broke the duck egg, it was difficult to stem Jen Yu's offensive. Chung Yi, Kuo Cheng, and Wen Yi then scored in succession. The Shan team only managed to score 20 points in the first half, trailing by ten points. In the second half, Jen Yu continued to control the game, with Little Wu shooting from long range and Peng Ju turning around under the basket. The Shan team only saw Ma Ts'an-hsi score with a long shot, making the score 30 to 17. In the final minutes, Jen Yu gradually became lax, and the Shan team quickly chased after them, but time was no longer on their side. As the buzzer sounded, the Shan team lost 35 to 40.</p>

<p>Ta Kung's Decline in the Final Match In the final match, Ta Kung fielded Wen Hua and Yun Shan as guards, Chin Tien in the center, and Lung T'an and Po Ling as forwards. Ch'i Ch'i's lineup consisted of Ti Hang, Ta Kuang, Chih Chi, Shih Hsuan, and Chih Chun. In the center jump, Lung T'an committed a foul, and Ch'i Ch'i scored the first point. Liao Ti-hang seemed divinely inspired, making two shots in a row, making the score 5-0. Ta Kung struggled to catch up, with Wen Hua scoring frequently. At 7-6, Ch'i Ch'i missed two free throws, and Chin Tien seized the opportunity to break through, giving Ta Kung an 8-7 lead for the first time. Wen Lung replaced Yun Shan, opening the attack. Wen Hua made a free throw, making it 11-7. Ta Kung's momentum was only briefly seen, and they declined from then on. Ch'i Ch'i's Cheng, Liao, and Wang rarely missed their shots, with long passes and fast breaks, making it impossible for Ta Kung to defend. With five minutes remaining in the first half, at 29-18, Ta Kung replaced all five players on the court with Lien K'o, Yun Shan, Wen Hua, Lung T'an, and Chin Tien, but there was still no improvement. At halftime, Ch'i Ch'i led 32-24, ahead by eight points.</p>
<p>After switching sides, the battle became deadlocked, with the score difference remaining at three or four points. Ta Kung was eager to win, making frequent mistakes, and Chung Ch'iang was particularly out of form. Ch'i Ch'i's performance also gradually became more ruthless, with both sides committing numerous fouls. After ten minutes, Ta Kung's defeat was sealed, and their morale declined. Only Wen Lung fought like a cornered beast. Although Wen Hua occasionally scored with mid-range shots, it was not enough to save the situation. As the final buzzer sounded, Ch'i Ch'i won by five baskets with a score of 59-49.</p>

<h3>Davis Cup Trials Begin: USA Wins Two Singles Matches Against Australia; Shroeder and Parker Defeat Quist and Sedgman; No Problem for the United States to Retain the Davis Cup</h3>
<p>[United Press, New York, 4th] American Davis Cup players Shroeder and Parker won two singles matches on the 4th in the opening of the Davis Cup trials against Australia, in front of 8,000 spectators at the Eastern Lawn Tennis Courts here. Shroeder easily defeated Australian Davis Cup team leader Quist 6-3, 4-6, 6-0, 6-0, while Parker defeated Australian newcomer Sedgman in straight sets 6-4, 6-4, 6-4. The doubles match is scheduled for the 5th, with Americans Mulloy and Talbert facing Australians Long and Quist. The final two singles matches will be held on Monday, with Sedgman against Shroeder and Parker against Quist. Shroeder's selection for this year's American Davis Cup team has been criticized by tennis experts. Shroeder participated in six major championships this year, losing five times. Today's victory proves that Davis Cup non-playing captain Meyne's choice was not a mistake. His experience is indeed superior. Parker's hitting today was incredibly well-prepared, like a machine. Sedgman had many errors, with 35 net touches and out-of-bounds shots. There seems to be no problem for the United States to continue to retain the Davis Cup.</p>
<p>Today's Final Two Games</p>
<p>Today is the final day of the charity event, with two more games. Ticket prices and match times remain the same. The schedule is as follows:</p>

<h3>Carnegie's Philosophy</h3>
<p>— Shih Tu</p>
<p>Dale Carnegie's book "How to Win Friends and Influence People" is said to have sold millions of copies. I don't know how many languages it has been translated into, but there are probably two Chinese translations. This is a good book. At least, it is a pleasing book! It tells you how to please others; how to "give small favors"; how to use the right bait to catch "fish." It also generously tells you Socrates' secret and many so-called "great men's" ways of dealing with the world.</p>
<p>No one doesn't want to improve their "social skills." Therefore, this book caters to the taste of the general public and truly "catches" millions of readers like the right bait. I myself was one of those "caught." I often hear people say, "My George doesn't understand social skills at all!" or "Jane doesn't have a single friend!" So this "George" or "Jane" would enthusiastically or secretly buy this book and read it over and over again. Naturally, this book would have a great influence on him or her, and they would change. One day, I deliberately flipped through this book in front of a "George."</p>
<p>"Ah! I've been studying this book for three years!" he said.</p>
<p>"Three years!" I said in surprise, "Then how many friends have you made?"</p>
<p>"How many?" He glared at me. "'Several dozen' is an understatement."</p>
<p>But many people in the city are suffering from this kind of distress: they have several dozen friends but lament their loneliness; they shake hands and laugh outside every day but lament the lack of friendship. Parisians are the most skilled at socializing, but they are also the most lacking in "friendship." A French nobleman declared that he would give half of his property to anyone who could give him valuable "friendship."</p>
<p>A comedy copied from the same "copy": people elegantly take off their hats, bend their waists, everyone is smiling, saying some unimportant things, the weather and movies are the best topics. Someone says, "Shakespeare is Russian!" So people say, "He's Russian!" Everyone is careful not to hurt other people's feelings, so everyone gives everyone a good impression, and everyone gains a friend. This kind of friendship may continue for a long time. Their friendship is probably built on "shared joy." If they don't watch movies or play bridge, they will be silent and embarrassed.</p>
<p>Romain Rolland has a wonderful saying: "People are not Louis d'or (an old French coin) and cannot please everyone." But Carnegie insists that we please everyone. In order to be a Louis d'or, people have to agree with others forever, never criticize others, and always say things that are ambiguous. Therefore, everyone lacks individuality. A friend criticizes us: "You all seem to be printed from the same plate! It's like admiring Italian plaster statues, it's hard to find a trace of thought on you!"</p>
<p>Carnegie's philosophy makes us appear frivolous, hypocritical, and lacking in individuality. Therefore, it is not easy for our hearts to merge, and we cannot see through each other's thoughts, which makes us lose the simple, deep, and real friendship. Carnegie may have given you several dozen friends, but he has not given you a trace of friendship!</p>
<h3>Book on Chu Chiang-ts'un</h3>
<p>— Ch'en Tso-kao</p>
<p>Chu Chiang-ts'un of Kuei-an was a master of tz'u poetry of the late Ch'ing Dynasty, on par with Wang Pan-t'ang, K'uang Hui-feng, and Cheng Ta-ho. Each of his works was meticulously regulated, his language was sharp and beautiful, like a second Meng-chuang. Critics have said that he surpassed the established rules, surpassing Chu, establishing great merit in the field of tz'u poetry, especially in textual research. He continued Pan-t'ang's research on Meng-chuang, and greatly expanded the field. His original name was Tsu-mou, his courtesy name was Hsiao-sheng, also known as Ku-wei, and his literary name was Ou-yin. After the dynastic change, he changed his name to Hsiao-tsang, also known as Chiang-ts'un. In his later years, he was a Ch'uan-lu (top graduate) and successively held the position of Vice Minister of the Ministry of Rites. During the Boxer Rebellion in the year of Gengzi (1900), he submitted multiple memorials strongly advising against using the Boxers, and personally faced the Empress Dowager Cixi, firmly stating that the Boxers could not be used. He spoke frankly and uprightly, without any flattery. His life was marked by integrity and distinction, as detailed in the biography written by Xia Sun-t'ung and the epitaph by Ch'en San-li. In the past, when I listened to my elders talk about his past deeds, there were often things that were not recorded in the biographies. Therefore, I, despite my ignorance, will pick up a few things to recount:</p>
<p>It is said that his success in the imperial examination was due to luck. Originally, his name was Tsu-hsun, and he inherited his brother Tsu-mou's name to take the Guangxu Renwu (1882) provincial examination. After passing, he did not change his name, and his old name was discarded. The following year, during the palace examination, he realized that his handwriting was crooked and did not conform to the standards of the court style. It happened that the examiner, surnamed Lao, was privately currying favor with the son of Grand Secretary Yan Jingming, and had long been interested in calligraphic skill. When he saw a paper that looked very similar to the handwriting of Yan's son, he presented the paper to the Guangxu Emperor, intending to award it first place. The Emperor said: "The writing is good, but the characters are not neat enough. Is this not a flaw in the white jade?" He immediately changed it to second class, first place, and exchanged it with Chen Mian. After the sealed paper was opened, the examiner suddenly realized that the top graduate of this Keju (imperial exam) was actually Zhu Tsu-mou, not Yan's son. The similarity of the two's handwriting had caused him to repeat Dongpo's mistake of privately promoting Li Fangshu, and he was filled with grief and indignation, almost falling ill. His late father, Guangdi, served in Henan, investigated a robbery case, redressed unjust verdicts, and saved seven lives (similar to reversing the Wang Shuwu case). Accumulating good deeds had a long history. Initially, Chiang-ts'un only hoped for the status of a Jinshi. Upon hearing the good news, he was filled with satisfaction and happiness, and he smiled as he closed his eyes on his sickbed. I heard this story from Niu Gengsheng, my great-uncle of the same generation. It seems that there is little outside knowledge. And he and Zhu had a good relationship that passed down through generations, with friendship like glue, I think it is not a false rumor. I recall that ten years ago, Shen Qi-ch'uan, Ta-yen-pai, often visited my home. He said that on the day of the examination, he suddenly lost his mother and hurried home for the funeral, which is why he missed being the top scorer; and after the make-up exam, he got the second-class second name. How far apart is the Deng Ke Di with Weng's position?</p>
<p>He began to study poetry very late, only starting when he was nearly forty, when he sought advice from Wang Pan-t'ang, who introduced him to friends. More than a decade later, he lived in Wu and discussed editing a collection of poems with Zhang Meng-chu. He then came to Shanghai and met K'uang Hui-feng, and they became close. Because K'uang's poems were selected, he was deeply admired, and he always addressed K'uang as "teacher" in his letters. Some letters remain with K'uang, and also with Han Hsiao-sung.</p>
<p>His wife was fierce, so when he was a guest in Shanghai, he would often curse at his wife in front of his close friends, calling her a "lioness". She died in Xinwei, at the age of seventy-five. He wrote collections of poems, which were passed down to the world. Before the change of banner, his wife still lived alone in Suzhou, treating it like Wu and Yue. Zhu then wrote a Ci "Partridge Sky" on the spot, saying: "Loyalty and filial piety, have I ever done my part? Over the years, the warmth of the ginger quilt has diminished. In my eyes, is the rhino horn true or false? After my death, will the ox cart of poverty harbor resentment and kindness? Bubbles and dew, a fleeting life, futile effort in making Ci poetry; pitiful is only the human world, not concluding the unfinished cause of the next life." The lament and knot, overflowing with words, is also the word of farewell.</p>
<h3>Rare Surnames</h3>
<p>— Yu Mo-chun</p>
<p>During the summer vacation, I had nothing to do and was very bored, so I often flipped through the notes of ancient and modern people, taking each for its own sake, and I could throw the book away when my hands were tired.</p>
<p>In K'uang Chou-yi's "Hui Feng Yi Erh Bi" volume two, it is recorded that in the Guangxi provincial examination of the eleventh year of Kangxi in the late Qing Dynasty, there was a Mao Changfu from Quanzhou. This surname is only seen here; Ji Dexiang, who ranked fifth in the Guangxu Ji Mao martial arts list, is also a rare surname.</p>
<p>In Ye Changchi's "Yuan Du Lu Diary", many rare surnames are also recorded: Ba, Bian, Chan, Gong, Tuo, Yun, Dao, Chou, E, Tuo, Xian, Wan, Ya, Tuo, Kou, Wei, Xing, Lu, Li, Dong, Ling, Xie, Men, Wei, Min, Yu, Chang, Lu and other unseen surnames. Compound surnames include "He Si" and "Gui Dai". These rare surnames were all obtained by Ye when he was a provincial education commissioner in Gansu and selected scholars from various places, and they are recorded in records ten and eleven, without fully listing the original text.</p>
<p>According to Zheng Qiao's Tong Zhi Lue, Zuo Shi only clarifies five categories: "Bestowing surnames because of birth, enfeoffing land to create a clan, and taking clan from characters, titles, officials, and cities. Nowadays, it is not the same. There are thirty-two categories for discussing surnames, and Zuo Shi's words are narrow! … In addition, there are four tones." Like the Guang and Lu surnames mentioned in the previous section, they both belong to "taking characters as clan", saying: The former came from the descendants of Jin official Xian Fu, and the latter came from the descendants of Zhou son Wu Geng, with the character Lu Fu, and there was also a Tibetan chieftain named Lu Dongzan. (Editor's note: During the Anti-Japanese War, the Kunming military police commander was Lu Guofan.) The clan Jie belonged to "taking names as clan", after Cangjie. The clan Li belonged to "taking officials as clan." Originally Li, it was changed in the Spring and Autumn period. Jin had Li Ke, Lu had Li Ge, and Zheng had Li Qi. The clan Gong belonged to "taking titles as clan", originally Ji, from the son of Duke Zhao of Lu, Gongzi Yan. Gongzi was afterwards. Zheng Qiao believed that Duke Zhao lost the country, so his descendants took the title as clan. The surname Yu belongs to the four tones of Ping Sheng, after Yu Wenhua and Jiang Yu Cheng of the Tang Dynasty. The remaining three surnames, Tuo, Xing and Wei, are all found in the three tones of Shang, Qu and Ru of the Tong Zhi Lue.</p>
<p>As for the rare surnames mentioned by the two authors, K'uang and Ye, that are not recorded in the Tong Zhi Lue, it is not easy to investigate.</p>

<h3>Flying Advertisements</h3>
<p>— Chen Xiang</p>
<p>If the astrologers of ancient times were to return to Earth this summer, they would surely be astonished by the sight of fiery, illuminated red-maned horses soaring through the sky, colossal whales wagging their tails and spouting water amidst the constellations, and giant chickens carrying babies in their beaks...</p>
<p>They might even witness divinely bestowed food – vast loaves of bread descending from the heavens, glowing with a mystical light.</p>
<p>These nocturnal spectacles are, in fact, "flying advertisements," created by affixing neon signs to the sides of small blimps. This novel form of aerial advertising is the latest innovation from Douglas Leigh, a New York-based outdoor advertising entrepreneur.</p>
<p>In late 1945, Leigh purchased three surplus blimps from the U.S. government and transformed them into airborne electric advertisements. Initially, however, there was little demand, and the expenses were staggeringly high – each blimp consumed $150,000 annually. But by the following autumn, Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM) leased the flying advertisements to promote their film, "The Yearling." Flying advertisements became an instant hit. Today, Leigh has acquired all 29 of the U.S. Navy's remaining surplus blimps, five of which are currently under contract. This innovative advertising method generates an annual revenue of $3 million for Leigh.</p>
<p>Flying advertisements possess an overwhelming advantage over other forms of advertising. Last autumn, the Associated Press (AP) held an editorial conference in Detroit. To usurp the position of the Nash Motors Company, General Motors Corporation (GM) purchased tickets for every editor to attend a football game between the University of Minnesota and the University of Michigan, transporting them to the stadium in Ann Arbor in GM's sleek new "Train of Tomorrow" automobiles. However, as the train departed Detroit, the sky-viewing car became crowded with editors, for a flying advertisement had appeared in the sky, its giant letters floating above the locomotive, proclaiming "Ford Leads the Way," closely tracking the train as it arrived at the stadium. In the end, GM expended great effort, but Ford reaped the advertising benefits.</p>
<h3>"Look to the Sun"</h3>
<p>— Zhi Yi</p>
<p>A collection of poems arrived from New York, titled "Look to the Sun," sent by the author Weston McDaniel for us to review.</p>
<p>Weston McDaniel is from Virginia, USA, residing in Louisiana and Florida. He first entered Mercer University and, after graduating, transferred to the University of Virginia and Western Reserve University, earning a Ph.D. in Literature. He worked as a teacher and principal in public schools, as well as a drama teacher, and was particularly fond of collecting folk songs and tunes. During World War II, he also put down his pen and joined the army, joining the Air Force, but still made time to write his poems, winning several poetry awards, including the Genie Award in 1944, and two special awards from the Tribune Publishing Company for soldiers. He has submitted manuscripts to various newspapers and literary magazines in the country. Before this collection of poems, he had published two collections, "Windows of Darkness" and "A Fire Miracle," both rich in Southern flavor. Although he now resides in New York, his slow speech and casual attitude fully reflect his Southern background, but he is not an old-fashioned Southerner. He can be said to be a typical emerging Southerner.</p>
<p>"Look to the Sun" contains a total of sixty-three poems, most of which have strength, emotion, and can deeply stimulate people's hearts, especially those that speak out against the inhumanity of the world. He writes in free verse, which makes it feel particularly vivid. This poet advocates that life should struggle against various negative forces. He is most familiar with the customs and beliefs of the South, expressing them in the form of folk songs, using magic as a symbol of all oppression, and describing the hope and happiness of mankind with the beauty and emotional power of the mountains. He has the foresight and compassion of a prophet, and understands human nature, so his poems are truly refreshing, using only colloquial words and phrases, truly "removing stale expressions." In short, he has a keen observational power and artistic expressive power, which can give readers a genuine impression and make them understand what is hindering cultural progress. If people can solve this problem because of this, then they can enter the world of Great Harmony. From this point of view, he is not only a Southern poet, but also a national, and even a global poet.</p>
<p>What this poet opposes most is narrow-mindedness. With narrow-mindedness, the world cannot be peaceful, and there will be conflicts. We must free ourselves from this trap in order to be saved, to live in peace, and to live happily. His avoidance of vulgarity is also where he succeeds. He is good at using ballads, although they do not conform to the old forms, they really open up another area. He is a completely authentic "Imagist".</p>
<p>His poems are a bit like our ancient Yuefu poems, genuine, simple, unadorned, and naturally humorous. His views also fit the temperaments of Easterners. We have never been narrow-minded. Confucianism advocates the Doctrine of the Mean: it is not biased in order to be called the Middle. Finally, let me quote a few lines from his poem:</p>
<p>"Racial hatred,</p>
<p>Religious hatred,</p>
<p>Hatred... has been around for a long time,</p>
<p>Wrong within wrong,</p>
<p>Suffocating everyone's heart."</p>
<h3>Evening View from the Thirteenth Floor</h3>
<p>— Zhang Yiqu</p>
<p>Thirty years of dust, a traveler's broken heart, tall buildings and the setting sun again, autumn clear, not yet quenching Sima Xiangru's thirst, dusk teaching Ruan Ji madness; worldly right and wrong are fleeting, gains and losses in the pot are entrusted to the azure sky, I too now engage in scheming, with discerning eyes I watch the yellow of the evening glow.</p>
<p>After the rain, cold leaves fly from the wutong trees, in the wind, the wild osmanthus has sick flowers, the vast wilderness is becoming desolate, the rugged world is still extravagant! City sentiments rise and fall, firewood and rice are both expensive, human affairs change, kudzu vine and melon, the sea smoke floats, autumn is faint, a lone scholar in exile feels the sorrow of insects and sand.</p>
<h3>Visiting the Tomb of the Loyal and Honorable Ancestor on Jingxian Mountain</h3>
<p>— Zong Xiaochen</p>
<p>The towering Huabiao is hidden on the mountain shoulders, and the white-haired descendants worship before the tomb. It has been thirty generations since me, and the grief for you has been a thousand years; the river flows endlessly, and the cries are still there, the declining grass cannot cover the loyal bones, the Fengshui is vast, and the legacy is far-reaching, with ten thousand peaks surrounding the earth.</p>
