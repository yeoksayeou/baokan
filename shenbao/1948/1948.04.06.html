<p>〔本報南京五日電〕國民大會第六次預備會議五日晨九時四十分舉行，出席代表二〇八〇人，莫德惠任臨時主席，宣讀秘書長洪蘭友因選舉過失自請處分之簽呈，內容略稱：「第五次預備會議進行過程中，因會塲幹事散發選票失當，因而竟有未領得選票者，及候選人名册中，因幹事解釋錯誤，遺漏代表姓名，蘭友督導無方，咎無可辭，除對會塲幹事嚴予處分外，請大會嚴予處分，以明責任」。莫氏宣讀完畢後即稱：洪秘書長自大會籌備迄今，畫夜辛勞，所請予以處分，可否免予置議，當經全塲一致鼓掌同意。旋由秘書長宣讀候選人名單及候選人莫德惠·陳布當·林紫貴·王繹齋·周世光·朱經農·蘇連元，·陳策等均宣布放棄候選人資格之函件，連上次會中要求放棄之何龍章·章繩以等十八人，共達卅餘人。候選人名單中，漁業團體因谷正綱放棄，改推戴行悌參加候選，故六十七單位中，僅大連·漢口·瀋陽·西安四團體未經選出，計候選人六十三人，經代表十人連署推選者爲一三二人，至業經宣布放棄候選人資格之各代表，如經選出，是否仍能取得當選資格一點，經秘書長依法解釋應取消候選人資格，惟因各代表之申請書有過嫌潦草者，秘書長特宣稱，請各代表於投票後另寫正式放棄當選證明書，彙交秘書處，以便依　辦理。</p>
<p>十時另五分，會議程序進至「重行選舉大會主席國案」，秘書長首先宣布在選舉過程中除代表及會塲幹事外，來賓，記者均請出塲，同時宣布會塲各門暫時關閉，停止出入，遲到代表暫緩入塲。此時會塲內及會塲各門曾張貼秘書處之布吿，說明此項情形，旋有人提出遲到代表應准許入塲事，當決定開一門以准進入，潘代表公展同時建議，此門亦許進入，在投票手續未完竣前，不得出門。十時廿五分，秘書長宣布淸夾在塲人數，並說明重行選舉之選票與上次所投票紙張不同，不致有所錯誤。並請投票開票監察員担任職務，以會塲分爲十二個區（樓下八區樓上四區），會塲幹事分區負責，辦理發票事宜。十時三刻開始發票，因在開會後續有到達者，迄至投票時止，出席人數為二二六九人，共發選票二二六九張，十一時五十五分，各代表依分區辦法進行投票後離開會塲，本日秩序因事先部署局密，故在時間上容有延遲，而秩序及手續上，則有條不紊。</p>
<h3 id="c4">于右任得票最多　為當選之第一人 <a href="#c4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>開票經過情形亦佳，當時，各監察員均在塲，監視會塲幹事之點票，各監察員公推劉紀文爲總監察，洪蘭友秘書長亦在塲協助，票櫃自會塲移至開票處後，每一票櫃由監察二人啓封，先行檢點選票數目，報繳總監察，然後將選票分爲六組，由總分票員分交各組組長轉各該組分票員分票，每一計票員負責計五個候選人，粟櫃共十二個，因分兩組辦理，廢票一律剔除，至下午二時廿分計算完畢，干右任以五十五票之最多票，爲當選主席團主席之第一人。</p>

<h3 id="c7">國大紀程　千呼萬喚始出來 <a href="#c7" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e7" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">7</a></h3>
<p>本報特寫（四月五日於南京）</p>
<p>五日下午五時正，國大第六次預備會續會中，英柳老（德惠）宣布：「當選主席的代表即刻就職」接着是大鼓掌，接着是洪秘書長依次唱名。主席們在陣陣掌聲里，依次登台，　讓着，微笑着他們的胸前，便添掛上個金字紅條兒，在主席案前，排成兩列。柳老乃從人縫中閃出來，步到發言台前，從容說道；「臨時主席和臨時秘書長任務終了，我們可以散會了。」主席團在千呼萬喚後方始產生，國大可以步人正式議程了。</p>
<p>國大開了六次預備會議，裏面有五次是爲了主席團的選舉而爭吵，後來組織法修改了，人數加多了，選舉辦法修改了，　到三日第五次預備會，看看票子都投了十之九了，沒想到為了兩個技術問題，第一次選舉作廢，又延擱了兩夜，第一個技術問題是選票上印的候選人名字中，漏了賀衷寒。原來是湖南單位召集人趙恒惕老先生，忘記把候選人簽署推舉書送到籌委會秘書處，讓洪蘭友挨了一頓寃枉駡，直到四日晚間，趙老把推舉書找到，算是問題解決，誤會冰消，湖南代表們覺得歉然。第二個間題是選票發到後來，由於秩序凌亂，票子竟然短少，這和前一個問題把三日的會塲攬得一團糟，而五日的會議進行，就因此又顯得緊張。</p>
<p>走進五日早晨的會塲，一眼看見主席台上端端的排了十二只票　，那是三日的廢票。會塲幹事們空前的控了一大堆一大堆的會議日程，散發給那些進塲時忘了領取的代表，因爲日程內印有全部候選人的名單，莫柳老宣讀過洪蘭友爲三日「督察不力」自請處分的文書後，又說：大家對三日的事都有責任。爲洪氏求了個情，免予議處。洪蘭友更辛苦的宣讀候選人名單。接着是漁會改推戴行悌作單位候選人，補谷正綱讓出來的缺。莫德惠。陳布雷和陳策等十九個候選人，一連串的放棄當選。</p>
<p>上午十時正，洪蘭友重又循前年的辦法，請來賓。新聞記者。譯員。隨員和沒有職務的大會職員一律退席，遲到的代表暫時也被關在大門外。隨着一齊撤退的，還有那主席台上的十二只廢票匭，十二只新的票　早已擺在會塲的出口處。</p>
<p>洪蘭友這時變成了一位指揮若定的將　，他把全部會塲劃分成十二個「大防區」，樓上四個，樓下八個。每一「大防區」里，又四排一劃的分成許多小格，被指定作投票監察員的代表，每一「大防區」分配兩位來「督戰」，大會職員則小格大區里都有專人負責，全然是「機械化」體系。</p>
<p>約模有三刻鐘，一切安排停當，洪氏發令了。</p>
<p>「發票的會塲幹事，聽候我的報吿，一齊發票！」</p>
<p>票匭擋着路的，要挪開來！」</p>
<p>「代表們　選後，請不要就立刻離開席次！」</p>
<p>會塲幹事們，如臨大敵，一再淸查在塲代表人數，總計二三三九位。十時五十分，有一部分等得焦灼的代表，已小有鼓噪，洪蘭友一聲令下，開始高速度發票，票子是黃色，決不致和三日的白色廢票弄錯。十分鐘後，選舉完了。</p>
<p>十一時三刻，被封鎖兩小時不到的票匭，又在水銀燈和開麥拉下打開來。第一步是分六個單位檢票。監察員把票子一張張取出來，交給幹事整理。計數。在以高速於二十分鐘裏完成這工作後，左右開弓的監察員歐陽崙漲紅着臉，笑笑說：「手臂眞有些酸了呢！」第二步是檢查廢票，在二三三三張票子裏，有十二張可疑的票，經鑑定五張是廢票。第三步開始把選票分給各管五位候選人的幹事們，個別計算。到二時正，全部分計完畢，然後以票數多少爲序，排列起來。其中票數相同的按姓氏筆劃決定先後。一九五位候選人裏，獲得選票的祗有一二九位，有六十六位連自己的一票也投了別人，三日上午找人簽署推舉，竟是白忙一陣。</p>
<p>八十五位當選人裏，得票最多的是子右任和谷正綱，五十五票，最少的是高巍和張伯苓，十一票。</p>
<p>到三點多鐘，秘書處把名册造好，監察員將報吿擬就，大功吿成，會塲裏人人飢腸轆轉，精疲力盡，歪坐在飯桌前。洪蘭友飯也吃不下，步履更形蹣跚；祗有總監察劉紀文，用筷子揀一塊紅燒肘子設：「我不緊張，所以我不累！」眞是好穩婆！」可在那邊長椅上一位懷孕的女幹事，已倚着椅背睡着了。</p>
<p>好難產的主席團啊，眞是千呼萬喚始出來！</p>

<p>〔本報南京五日電〕蔣主席宣布不願參加總統競選消息傳出後，似未影響一般人士擁戴主席出任首任總統之決心。社會賢達莫德惠，五日下午二時舉行記者招待會時，記者即詢以對將主席不願競選之感想如何？莫氏堅定答稱：目前國家局勢實非蔣先生擔任總統不可，出任總統，亦可謂爲蔣先生義不容辭之事，蔣先生之謙辭，爲中國人之美德，然無論如何，國大同仁一定選舉蔣先生爲總統。北大校長胡適，五日在國大會堂答記者詢問時亦謂：「本人決簽屠提名擁護蔣主席競選總統」。南開大學校長張伯苓五日晨語記者，中國局勢玆困難，蔣主席如不願競選總統，將來國是如何，殊難預料，而目前情勢任何人任總統均有困難，惟有由蔣主席出任，始可度此難關。</p>

<p>民社黨人士談稱蔣主席不宜謙退</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕關於蔣主席不願參加本屆總統競選事，民社黨人士認爲主席讓賢，確具誠意，惟以主席威望之隆，如渠願負實際責任而担任行政院長，則總統一席勢必成爲難產；同時主席前日之表示，僅爲其個人之意見，以目前時局之嚴重，國民黨內部決不致任其謙退。民社黨自張君勱以下各要員，對此均拒不作公開表示，即在中常會後，對總統競選事亦不擬有公開之聲明。該黨某常委昨日語記者：「余等認爲總統競選不應成爲討論之問題，因非主席莫屬；値得研究者爲副總統人選」。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕記者爲明瞭美僑對蔣主席不願競選總統之反響起見，昨特走訪本市美商會會長歇蓋，氏能態度極爲審愼，僅允發表其個人意見，略謂：「除蔣主席外，實無人能獲全國人民之信仰。予認爲貴國未來總統之人選，應以有力量統馭全國各種勢力爲要件，而不必老慮其國際聲望爲如何。中國之領袖只須得中國人民之擁戴，至於美國，英國或其他國家是否滿意，乃爲不相干之事」。詢以如胡適博士任總統候選人，是否爲適當人選，渠答謂：「胡博士從未謀面，事關貴國內政，本人對此諸多隔膜，未敢妄加批評。個人認爲如胡博士能任行政院長之職，可表示中國改革內政之重大步驟」。記者復詢以如主席堅持不競選總統，則以何人出而競選爲比較理想？氏答稱：「我人認爲宋子文氏頗爲幹練，惟其在國內人望如何，則不知」。</p>

<h3 id="c13">感化與獻媚 <a href="#c13" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e13" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">13</a></h3>
<p>— 王平陵</p>
<p>最近拜讀若干專家們的文章，實在叫人啼笑皆非，像何永佶先生的「杯酒一席談」，就是一例。我被困擾於從這一類專家們的腦子裏所分泌出來的奇奇怪怪的妙論，雖欲「相應不理」，總覺得如有骨鯁在喉，非吐不快。</p>
<p>照何先生的說法；中國共產黨本來就是中國傳統的「土貨」，並無所謂「馬列主義」的一套，絕少國際意味，充其量不過是銅馬，赤眉……那種作風的「農民暴動」，如果美國借錢給中國，帮中國「戡亂」，就會逼着「土產」的中共，投奔到蘇聯的懷抱，加速三次大戰的到來。這真是抹煞事實，開着眼睛說夢話，除了華萊士先生引為知己，聽得津津有味外，我相信祇要是稍稍明瞭實情的美國人，頂多付之一笑而已！何先生這樣小看中共，瞧不起中共，實在是不瞭解中共！</p>
<p>何先生又以為祗須華萊士再握到美國的政權，則美蘇間的糾紛，就可迎刃而解。什麼是他解決的法寶呢？據他們那一晚商談的結果，大約是先憑華萊士先生的人格做担保，取得對方的信任，而後以身作則，澈底撒除美國的國防，感化之不足，繼之以獻媚，做到美國變相的「無條件投降」，那就化大事為小事，小事為無事了。不過，美國人肯不肯把自華盛頓肇建國基以來中經無數志士仁人的慘淡經營才有今天的美國，甘心讓華萊士先生當作試驗抱負的工具，却是疑問。就算華萊士當真有這麼一天能把「感化與獻媚」的政策，表現到使自己滿意的程度，但是否就能博得對方的滿意，怕還在未定之天吧！</p>
<p>老實說，戰後的世界，殘破不堪，誰不渴望建設，此刻活着的人，都已飽嘗戰爭的滋味，誰不祈禱和平；惟建設，和平的爭取，倘要採用「感化與獻媚」的笨法，最起碼的條件，要有一方自願無限止地犧牲，另一方的慾望能够適可而止；必須有一方自願作大踏步的退讓，另一方的步伐，必須止於認為滿足的階段，決下「得步進步」。這在純粹基於「利害關頭」的國與國的交涉，是可能的嗎？縱有一方自願退讓，誰能担保另一方能够自知滿足呢？萬一永遠不能滿足，又有什麼可靠的善策能縮小另一方的慾望呢？</p>
<p>當第一次大戰告終，英國人確能保持傳統的「紳士風度」，首先履行「海縮會議」的決議，實行以身作則的「感化主義」；但是希脫勒接受英國的感化，却愈益擴展了侵略的野心。到二次大戰的前夜，張怕倫已知「感化主義」的無效，不但不屈駕慕尼黑去獻媚，誰知獻媚的態度，越是恭敬和誠摯，二次大戰的火藥庫越是爆發得快速而澈底。殷　不遠，前事可師，在人性消沉，默性猖獗的今天，設沒有足够遇阻獸性衝動的硬性力量，人類的浩刧將演變到如何可怕的境地，實無法想像。在人類史上所扮演的傷心怵目的悲劇，真使我懷疑孟子的性善說，見迂關而不切事情，不得不承認苟子，霍布士所倡導的「性惡」的主張，倒是近於現實的真理。根據霍布士的哲學，所謂人間的親善，國際的和平，骨子裏是互相利用，勢均力敵的結果，人們的努力，便是把和平的局面，在戰戰統兢，時虞破裂的危崖下，若斷若續地延長。祇要有一方的實力，稍有差池，不能穩住平衡的天秤，就能牽一髮而動全身，燬壞了整個的系統和秩序，那時，一切仁義道德的呼號，已變成廢話，決不能挽回人類的浩刧。霍布士毫不留情地指出人性有這一個走向滅亡的弱點，自然令人毛髮　然，慄慄畏懼；但一般可憐的羔羊，為要逃避滅亡，拜伏在吃人的老虎面前百般獻媚，搖尾乞憐，是何等的愚蠢，威爾斯在所著「未來世界」一書中，曾說：「在近世動物界滅種的企鵝，就因為不敢正視敵人的殘酷，羣起自救；而是當自己的兄弟被巨獸或鷙烏吞吃時，反在抄灘上鼓動好聽的歌喉，張開美麗的翅膀，跳舞唱歌竭盡自己的天賦，娛樂殘殺兄弟的敵人，希望不吃自己，結果是吃完了兄弟，再吃自己，終於全部吃掉，　有孑遺，僅感為動物學上的名詞了。」想不到今天有些自以為有智慧的專家們，其智慧乃猶在滅種的企鵝之下！</p>
<p>世人誠欲避免可能到來的浩劫，決不能再用「感化與獻媚」的笨法，造成「人為刀鋸，我為魚肉」的形式，就祗有盡可能克服自己的一切弱點，使對方無懈可擊，絕對找不到最弱的一環。這才能讓大家在堅持不決，陷終僵局的困境中，尋覓到自我反省的空隙，召回消失的人性，再從利害關頭，知己知彼，權衡輕重，就是到熬無可熬，忍無可忍的時候，仍不敢較量，倘要較量，即同歸於盡。延長到彼此筋疲力竭，心灰意懶的程度，人類的心情，已由非常而變為常態，緊張而轉為鬆弛，也許能莫逆於心，相視而笑地說一聲：「算了，算了，」於是，才肯死心蹋地，另覓合理的解決途徑的。</p>
<p>現在的情勢，彷彿是星雲系的各個星球剛剛形成，尚未蹈上各不相犯，吸力平衡的軌道。從戰爭到勝利，是經渦八年的時間，則從勝利到和平，也許要加倍的時間，才能獲致；今天既有兩種不很類似的思想與生活方式的對立，周然可視為人類的不幸，但亦未始不是人類的「防腐劑」，祗要善於運用，把天秤的均勢擺得穩，不但沒有什麼危險，很可能用作督促人類進步的要素。但如有一方面意圖採用「感化與獻媚」的笨法，賣情求安，則無畏是自啟弱點，授人以可乘之隙，人既有刀鋸在手，為什麼不　魚肉以自肥呢！</p>

<p>— 本報華中戰地記者　卜眠</p>
<p>〔本報漢口四日訊〕這已是大地春回的季節了，然而連日來天氣驟寒，一陣陣春雨，確把人們期待已久的「春之夢」打破了，人們暫時又縮回到殘冬一般的氣氛里，而春天似乎更渺茫了。記者在京勾留六日，不是天陰便下雨，只有一個完整的睛天，直至黃花崗烈士紀念日，也是國民大會揭幕的那一天，藍天呈現了原始的微笑，它帶來了一片晴光，同時，給人們以微溫的感情的迎春曲，在結伴成羣的遊春者的唇邊，開始躍動起來。</p>
<p>蕪湖小鏡頭</p>
<p>蕪湖是京漢綫上第一站，記者在這里留宿了一夜，終終船姍姍地來了，可是抵蕪時已夜間十一時，在貧血的電燈光中，只看到一點市容的糢糊輪廓，日用品的價錢較京滬為低，一等機米每石三百二十五萬，最好的麵粉每石一百七十六萬，豬肉每斤六萬元，牛肉每斤四萬元，鷄蛋每只五千元，白菜或菠菜每斤各五六千元。娛樂場所共六七家，其中有三家電影院，多半演着上海早已演過的國產片子，如黑衣女郎，憶江南，郎才女貌等，票價並不貴，每張兩萬元，有一家電影院因「三二九」紀念日優待觀眾，票價僅售一萬三千元。平劇院都設在茶社裏，一邊吃茶，一邊聽戲。歌女僅廣東酒家有兩個，算是蕪湖僅有的「歌鶑」，在那里播唱上海歌曲。報紙雖有好幾家，銷絡却很慘，而售價特昂，一張對開報售萬元，船上還要貴一倍。有一家復興日報，他的編排與眾不同，即在全國亦罕見，她把副刋的位置放在第一版四分之一的右下角，其餘四分之三是廣告，我不敢武斷這究竟是為了地位狹小抑或是為了編排的處理。安慶是第二站，船未停，只是在匆忙中對這安徽省城作了一瞥。</p>
<p>走馬看九江</p>
<p>船到九江，雖然只停九十分鐘，但幸運的是白畫帮了不少忙，使我能在短短的一個半小時中看個分曉。踏上九江的街頭，我便想起上海的南市，除了幾條馬路比南市整齊寬廣外，其他的都及不上南市的繁榮。馬路上看不到一輛汽車，連人力車也寥寥無幾。商店以販賣磁器者佔最多數，生意也很冷落，只有一些由京滬到粵漢的過境旅客去光顧，然而畢竟是有限的。每家舖子外表上開着門，實際上與「打烊」無異。全城戲院只有一家榮譽平劇院，票價雖不貴，觀眾確並不擁擠。報紙僅有一家小型報，因紙張昂貴，用戰時的熟料紙維持出版，售價與上海各大報相等。物價比蕪湖還低，機米每担二百九十萬，炒一盆肉絲，份量比京滬多一倍，售價僅八萬元，一碗麵只賣兩萬元。磁器並不便宜，這是出乎意外的，一把小茶壼至少十六萬，還有更貴的。走馬看九江，剎那之間所看到的也許是九江外層的外層。</p>
<p>京漢綫的路程，平常三天可以到，這一次因霧阻滯，超出預定的航程一天。經過了可厭倦的四天的船上生活之後，纔從厭倦和疲勞中逐漸恢復過來，踏上了漢口的大地。</p>
<h3 id="c40">遙祭黃陸 <a href="#c40" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e40" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">40</a></h3>
<p>— 張兆榮</p>
<p>黃帝陵位陝西中部縣，今改稱黃陵縣，陵寢所在，山形隆起，流水環繞四週，狀若橋，故稱橋陵。司馬遷史記稱：「黃帝崩，葬橋山」，即指今之橋陵。橋陵山勢高聳，附近萬山朝拱，氣魄雄偉，滿山古柏，點綴其間，景色尤佳勝。軒轅廟前，有古柏一株，可七人合抱，相傳為黃帝手植樹。漢武帝求仙，曾築台於此，至今有一柏樹，釘痕累累，傳即漢武掛田樹。陵前一碑，有蔣主席親題「黃帝陵」大字，筆跡秀麗。黃陵不特為歷史古蹟所在，抑且為名勝之區，中央為追崇祖德，向例每年均特派大員，謁陵致祭。本年因戰事交通影響，僅能在西安遙祭，興念及此，不勝感慨系之。</p>
<p>黃帝為我民族祖先，創文字，制舟軍，造冕服，經器用，建築宮室，鑄造貨幣，發明蠶絲，著作醫經，訂定律呂，分命官司，建立民族，對中華民族文化生存之貢獻，厥功奇偉，有史可徵。即天子位後，「天下有不順者，黃帝從而征之，平者去之，披山通道，未嘗寗居，東至於海，登丸山，及岱東，西至崆峒，登鷄頭，南至於江，登熊湘，北逐　粥，合符釜山」。事業極盛，故後世皆以子孫自居，以不忘於祖德也。</p>
<p>去歲清明節，余陪田監察使炯錦，王市長友真，蔣廳長堅忍等，祭祀其間。祭畢曾與諸公縱談黃陵修建計劃，蓋中央曾訓令陝省府，擬具修建意見，蔣廳長即以此事徵詢也。余意黃陵之修建，其規模應大於中山陵，其景緻應優於譚墓，良以黃帝之功，不亞於中山先生，允宜有一全國性與國際性之建築，為百世子孫所瞻仰，並以示我族歷史悠久與文化博大於友邦各國，而該地山青水秀，益以人工布置，自可遠勝於譚組庵先生墓道。至修建計劃，余請以西北工學院土木水利機械電機礦冶各系教授同仁，合組一考察團，如何求建築之宏偉，如何利用附近河流，築蓄水池噴水池以增加美觀，如何使成鋼鐵路延長，北至延安，以便利交通，如何發展附近礦產，建立工業繁榮陝省，皆有待專家之細心擘劃，而經費之籌措，亦一重要問題。余意炎黃世冑，為興建祖先陵園，必皆樂於解囊，故一經號召，款項之來源，甚屬易易，每人平均負担萬元，四億五千萬海內外同胞，所集成數，即大有可觀矣。惟此事須中央發動，各地附從，技術問題，亦應注意及之。陵園既建成，每屆清明節，各省均應派代表，前往致祭，而國際人士，參加其間，亦所歡迎。園之附近，更應興設大學，以資紀念。果能如是，前途之發展，未可限量矣。</p>
<p>曾幾何時，洛川戰起，黃陵亦以被佔聞。共黨摧殘我國固有文化，無所不用其極，陵國所在，定卜凶多吉少，為之戚然！黃陵為聖地，萬不容匪人破壞污損，我大軍現已雲集西安，亟應即速收復，以期無負於我祖先在天之靈。</p>
<p>昔黃帝修德振兵，治五氣，藝五種，撫萬民，度四方，教能熊貔貅　虎，攻克敵患，奠子孫萬世生存之基，而今民族生存，岌岌可危，內亂急須敉平，人民亟須生息休養，發揚祖先創業精神，修明文治，訓練三軍，迅速完成戡亂大計，實為刻不容緩之要圖。</p>
<p>史稱「黃帝之世，人民不夭，百官無私，市不預賈，城郭不閉，邑無盜賊，相讓以財，風雨時，五穀登，遠夷之國，莫不獻其貢職」。以視當今之世，人民死亡相繼，貪污公行，盜賊蜂起，朝野惟利是競，國際地位，一落千丈者，誠將何顏以對，故必須勵精圖治，為政者率先倡導，以黃帝盛世之治為今後努力之標的。</p>
<p>五日為民族掃墓節，遙祭黃陵，萬感交集，爰濡　以寄慨。</p>

<p>〔路透社巴黎四日電〕內長莫赫今日在地中海岸之賽特發表演說，警吿共產黨人謂，若再度發動工潮，政府決以强力措施對付。渠指出去歲十一月及十二月之罷工，係共黨奉共產情報局之令而發動。最近在法國及義國北部亦同時發生社會活動，常有參加蘇僑公會，法國波蘭工黨及自由義大利運動之外國份子予以支持。法國雖繼續願意收容願來工作之每一外國人，但法國要求彼等勿得干涉法國內政，聽任法人自行解決其爭端。法人於去歲十一月及十二月已獲有敎訓，今日已獲更完善的準備與組織，必能順利排護共和國之秩序。</p>

<p>〔聯合社柏林四日電〕美軍參謀長蓋萊與蘇軍副司令特拉特文今日交換照會，同意立即談判蘇軍陸上交通管制問題。同時，美軍當局下令停止空運糧食至柏林。柏林方面兩星期來之緊急局勢因之略見緩和。蘇方並向英法兩國提出同樣照會，英法尙未提出復文。特氏並表示將設法解除客貨運輸之一部份困難，但堅持不能改變現行管制條例。蓋氏答稱，願與會商，惟蘇軍在其佔領區內登車檢查一節，礙難受。蘇接聯照會否認有準許西方各國自由使用其佔領區與柏林間公路與鐵這之任何協定存在，據稱由於交通缺乏管制，不肖份子乘隙從事各種投機與非法活動，致在蘇佔區犯案纍纍。西方各國現對蘇聯建議舉行談判一事，並不過份樂觀。此間公路檢查站已無美英法軍隊駐守，四日以來尙屬初次。僅通至玉哈諾成之公路與柏林及西德間單軌鐵路各一條仍由蘇軍設站檢查。</p>

<p>（十）緬甸輸油管的計劃</p>
<p>中緬印戰區司令部目光之短促，可由其對縱貫緬甸的輸油管的態度見之。</p>
<p>爲史迪威辯護者似乎理直氣壯，認爲不講別的，單是這條輸油管，就足以證明他一心一意致力於緬甸戰役的意義了。</p>
<p>實際上，輸油管計劃是中國國防供應委員會所設想的，後者係珍珠港事件發生前幾個月在美國成立，曾有一次爲史迪威所拒絕。</p>
<p>一九四一年夏季，在日軍佔領緬甸之前，殼牌油公司的工程師曾經設計一種可以隨時携帶的輸油管，主張沿舊緬甸公路敷設。這種設計，曾送呈華盛頓的陸軍工程師，後者曾加以應用，但是當時並未用於緬甸。日軍在一九四二年六日完全控制了那裏。</p>
<p>在一九四二年年底以前，戰區司令部人員並未考慮過輸油管計劃。在一九四二年年底時，中國國防供應委員會和租借代表向在重慶的史迪威梯形先頭部隊司令漢恩將軍提起這個計劃。他們建議將它包括於當時史迪威正在草擬的緬甸作戰計劃之內。他們提出了正式的建議。</p>
<p>當這個計劃向史迪威提出之時，他不表贊同。有人吿訴我說，當中國國防供應委員會的一個代表後來想加以說項的時候，他拒絕討論此一問題。</p>
<p>據說史迪威的反應是這樣的：「我不要什麼討厭的輸油管——我所要的是子彈，祗是子彈」。</p>
<p>我相信輸油管計劃之最後併入緬甸作戰計劃，乃由於華盛頓方面的供應主任沙曼凡爾將軍的堅持所致。這是一個軍要的計劃。假如沒有這個計劃的話，緬甸公路對於中國的價値，將不及增加一批飛越駝峯的運輸機。</p>
<p>我一向認爲戰區司令部第一應該注意的，就是儘量擴充飛越駝峯的空運設施。縱使在緬甸公路和輸油管都發揮作用之後，我們大部份所獲得的東西，還是從空中來的。</p>
<p>但是史迪威認爲飛越駝峯的空運，乃是對他緬甸公路計劃的一種競爭。直到他緬甸作戰的中間階段，空運供應品的工作，對於他作戰的成功，成爲相當重要的一個因素。假如沒有空遝，包括油管的空運在內，輸油管工程以及緬甸作戰的其他方面，包括中國軍隊渡過怒江發動攻勢內，都會在中途失敗。</p>
<p>値得注意的一點，就是當史迪威在緬甸北部推進而把新陸上通路來多公路建築起來之後，結果證明不能滿足他攻勢的需要，雖則開關這條公路的表面理由，就是把貨物運到中國來。</p>
<p>起初，在一九四二年的時候，美國飛越駝峯的空運工作，不爲中緬印戰區司令部方面所重視。負責方面對於中國境內空運工作的重要性，朱能明白認識。</p>
<p>中國國防供應委員會的官員在一九四二年時，想增加空運的貨物噸位，比賽爾將軍代表史迪威對他們說，他估計假如每月要運五千噸貨物，就需要在昆明區有廿五個大飛機塲和三百架飛機。一九四五年，當戰爭結束的時候，每月飛越駝峯所載運的貨物，顯示這種估計的脆弱。</p>
<p>但是比賽爾的保守態度，照他自己的經驗講，並不是沒有根據的。在他之前以及在空運指揮部於一九四二年加以接管之前，在戰區司令部中負責飛越駝峯空運工作的奈頓將軍的保守態度，也是一樣。</p>
<p>在那一年中國航空公司的飛越駝峯空述工作，已經超過美國陸運飛機頗多。史迪威已同意將美國陸軍遝輸機從一百架减至廿五架，猶如空軍司令部所命令的，其理由是駝峯這條路不切實用。當駝峯空運工作移交予空運指揮部的時候，曾爲戰區司令部方面所反對而無效。</p>
<p>在駝峯運輸工作移交之後的幾個月之內，每月的運輸量是在一千二百噸與二千五百噸之間，直到一九四三年的夏季一直如此。史迪威將軍似乎並不感覺不滿意。</p>
<p>但是我是不滿意的。駝峯的運輸工作，直接有關我爲中國空軍大隊以及後來的第十四航空滕成爲一個有效武器所作的一切努力。我被迫相信史迪威對於中國方面的空運工作，祗不過想每個月運幾百噸的炸彈，彈藥，燃料和另件而已。</p>
<p>就是我想保持中國空軍最低限度實力的這種努力，也使我於一九四三年一月間與史迪威及比賽爾有所爭執。那時候，每月供給中國空軍大隊的燃料和汽油是七百五十噸左右，史迪威却還把它减少一半。</p>
<p>愼重研究的結果，顯示如此做去，中國空軍大隊勢必不但要放棄攻勢，並且要放棄中國各地的空中防衛，惟中國空軍大隊司令部及駝峯空運路綫以主要終點昆明除外。同時，從駝峯方面運來的相當多的貨物，正堆積在昆明之西的雲南驛，且在緬甸與印度支那方面的日本飛機的轟炸範圍之內。</p>
<p>當我吿訴比賽爾將軍說减少供應將使我祗能防衛昆明一地之後，他就回答說，我必須防衛雲南驛。我祗能回答他說，我不知道沒有燃料怎樣叫飛機起飛。</p>
<p>於是我飛到重慶去親自向史迪威解釋。他在口頭上命令我停止雲南驛的防衛。我要求他筆之於書，他並不這樣做。但是下一天早晨，我又把命令翻過來，把原已削减的貨物噸位恢復了。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕前日某報刋載關於行政院善後事業委員會保管委員會漁業管理處「黑幕重重弊端叢生」之消息一則，長數千言，揭布漁管處主要罪行八大點。記者昨日特以此事走詢現任漁管處趙處長君邁，據趙表示，該項新聞內所述各點與事實不符。又昨日適逢該處負責主管人員每週例會，各單位主管人均到，當時會中即提出此問題，經硏究後，成認不確。記者復詢以監察院是否有派員偵查等情。趙氏稱，監察院調查確係事實，但該委員亦以所告之點經調查後與事實不符而已返京。至述及趙處長本人頂進洋房一則。據趙氏稱，其目前所居之屋爲一普通之公寓房子，是否有洋房，事實可證明，渠本人對此案不願有所聲明或更正，惟歡迎各界隨時前往復興島該處參觀或調查，以明眞相。至關於攻擊過去數處長部分，則渠無從答覆，可由彼等自行表示意見。</p>

<p>〔路透社南京五日電〕中國政府業已請求麥克阿瑟將軍將未獲中國當局准許於四日下午搜離中國之雷諾等一行，押解返滬。駐日美空軍當局，曾詢問中國政府願扣留雷諾等一行，抑將其送回中國。中國政府之覆電，要求將雷諾等引渡來華，其所基理由乃為雷諾等四日離上海時，未曾結淸未了事務，未履行海關例行手續，並背棄對中國方面所作在探險計劃之整個問題解決以前決不離華之諾言，實爲破壞中國之主權。交通部與民航局會商後，遂決定要求盟總令雷諾等重返中國。</p>
<p>〔合衆社東京五日電〕雷諾於五日下午七時半（上海時間六時半）駕「探險家」號飛機自此間羽田機塲起飛，機師仍爲奧頓，事先已由盟總准其繼續飛行。雷諾稱，將在中途島小憇，然後赴夏威夷迎載其　及孫兒兩人，再由舊金山飛返芝加哥。</p>
<h3 id="c79">滬美商會會長痛罵雷諾劣行　國務院候駐華使館查報 <a href="#c79" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e79" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">79</a></h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕本市美商會會長歇蓋，昨日接見本報記者，，對雷諾事件發表意見稱：「希望中國人士勿將雷諾視爲在華全體美商之典型代表。雷諾實爲一愚人及瘋子，僅希望其名姓見報，而不問其新聞內容。此事對在華美商之名譽頗有妨碍，本人身爲美商會會長，故此事發生後，至感爲難。今晨會晤美總領事時，會坦率表示，今後國務院發出護照時，能度應比過去鄭重，以免發生類似事件。以後如有人至中國進行探險及其他計劃，其辦法與經費，應先呈報美國有關機關，予以保管及監督，方屬　妥。否則類似雷諾之瘋徒，可能再度出現也。國際上不乏有價値之探險團體，雷諾已予以甚大之妨碍，因中國已因此次事件，對此類團體表示懷疑。最後，本人希望國務院對此劣行，能採取堅定之立塲」。</p>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓五日電〕國務院官員五日稱，已要求美國駐華大使館詳盡報告雷諾在上海所發生之情事。彼等在接獲報告前，對雷諾之「逃出中國」，拒絕置評。</p>
<p>侮蔑我國　信口雌黃</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕雷諾逃至東京後，大放厥詞，侮蔑我方「虛構罪狀，企岡敲竹槓」。並謊稱當其探險機起飛時，我方機塲守衛曾開槍射擊，我國空軍並「急起直追」。民航局上海辦事處對雷諾此種毓言昨已鄭重否認。</p>
<p>〔聯合社東京五日電〕雷諾昨夜未經許可自上海飛至此間，據談此次脫逃爲避免「財政破逢」。並稱，「中四衛兵曾持槍阻其本人及機員三人登機，他們緊跟着我，我進機拋出鋼筆五十枝，碰上了門。駕駛員奧登即開動引擎飛離跑道，衛兵即散去」。</p>
<p>承認違背諾言</p>
<p>〔又電〕雷諾稱，今日將會見遠東美空軍司令，辦理飛返美國手續。雷諾聽到中國積石山探測團團長降本楝之責備時稱：當然，我違背在中國對他提供的每種諾言，在成迫與輕機關槍陰影下，我永將違背我的諾言。當我向薩氏提供諾言時，武裝衛兵包圍我的飛機，我和機員們被扣留，這種行動違背協定，亦無適當法律手續。我惟一脫離的方法，就是對他們允許一切。我不得不在過去，現在和未來允許他們，以求脫離他們的掌握。至於我的護照，是被强迫取去的，他們還給我一張收條。中國方面須得說明我犯何罪，不可含糊其詞。</p>
<p>願償還我欠款</p>
<p>雷諾又稱，此次飛來日本，並無護照，欠中國方面五千三百萬元，即將寄支票償還。當初担任探測工作，是「他們强迫我做的，他們增加人員和費用，我只有同意」。</p>
<p>機身並無彈孔</p>
<p>〔合衆社東京五日電〕此間美國官員五日拒絕評述雷諾「逃出」中國之荒唐事，並坦白承認對飛行事引起之國際性曲折情情事，大惑不解。雷諾之電報員李爾稱：「探險家」號機自龍華機塲起飛時，中國警察曾開槍射擊。然美國空軍官員五日晨稱，經詳細檢查後，機身上並無彈孔或其他損害。雷諾一行飛返美國可無問題，蓋渠違犯者僅中國法律而已，而消息靈通人士相信，美國不政越俎代謀？爲中國執行法律。雷諾電告其妻及原子筆廠廠長蘭姆，報告平安，並稱，即將歸去。</p>
<p>雷諾於三日在南京向　本棟氏作諾言時留影，次日即不別而去。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕本市證劵交易所，昨奉令取締遞延交割業務，致華股全面慘跌，結果現貨跌停十四種，期貨全部跌停。永紗晨開即以一四〇七元跌停，下午更乏交易，永紗曾喊一三六〇元售出，人心頗形紊亂。</p>
<p>財經兩部駐本市證交監理官，於四日晚接奉兩部三日訓令，指示規定四點，（已見昨日本報第一版）除電知上海市政府外，並着即轉飭證交，取締遞延交易業務。證交王黎兩監理官，當通知證交當局查照辦理。證交當於昨晨在市塲將兩部取締訓令正式公告，並規定遞延交割交易，自卅七年四月五日前市起，停止新交易。如有了結交易，做至四月七日（星期三）前市爲止。所有未了結存帳，仍照原約定日期四月九日（星期五）辦理交割。證交當局並召集經紀人公會負責理事等談話，對兩部取締遞延交易之規定，有所解釋。</p>
<p>經紀人公會，於下午一時許，召開臨時常務理事會議，對遞交存帳發生差額時之處理辦法，於四時許再度與證交當局洽商。最後決定，對所有各經耙人代客戶了結本期遞交原有相互軋抵部份之交易，致存帳發生差額時，仍照原定辦法，徵收本證據金現金五成，每一經紀人存帳額，仍以國幣二百億元爲限。以上規定，除由證交正式公告外，經紀人公會亦於昨晚通函各同業查照，即行遵辦，了結遞延交易。</p>
<p>晨初華股市塲即因停做遞交而大怯，永紗現遞開出即告跌停板，遞永紗且低於限度。開後補空者紛紜，曾升至一四九五元，現遞同價。但旋即因斬售者多，宣告跌停。永公勤興信和最綸火柴新華中法新光等咸告跌停，除永紗信和新光火柴永公景　勤興中法跌停板，閘北統益商務中絲新華跌停後有回，中泥跌半成，榮豐麗安華新跌一成，國貨降成半。遞交股新光跌一成，永紗信和勤興跌停。</p>
<p>情况更壞，永紗仍告跌停。嗣後即越仍越小，除華泥聯地榮豐大通統益恒豐未曾跌停，永業信誼中泥無成交外，均告跌停。即交永紗威低至一三五〇元，較晨收即交股恒豐尚平，華新榮豐麗安小挫，大通統益跌半成，餘均跌停。遞交股全部跌停。塲外各未上市股票平疲居多。</p>

<p>記者昨天特意去訪問國立東北大學，回來感想頗多，看東大的慘狀，我們爲東北敎育揑一把汗。與我去年夏天對東大的印象大不相同，現在的東大，校舍破壞，設備空虛，形式上絃誦不絕，實際上總缺少了什麽？這是由於物價高壓與砲火　烈的雙重惡果，中國敎育已面臨最嚴重的關頭，東北敎育問題更嚴重</p>
<p>東北環境太惡劣了。東大校長劉樹勛先生以環境特殊解釋着一切問題，不住的搖頭。東大新春的第一課是「遷校問題」，這兩天正忙着補行上學期的考試，期考之後，「爭取遷校」運動便是學生自治會的中心任務。多數敎授口裏隱藏，內心贊成澀校。遷往何處？大家心目中的目標是北平，但沒有提出來。劉校長對遷校沒有表示意見，他否認其事，認爲遷與不遷同樣困難。校長遵照敎育部的命令行事，我想敎育部不曾有正式遷校的命令到來。</p>
<p>遷校的理論振振有詞，他們說：如不遷校，便是宣告東北敎育的破產！要求遷校的標　漫畫，使冷落的東大生色不少，學生一邊張貼，校役一邊洗刷。從理論上講，教育需要政治經濟穩定的社會環境，在戰亂飢饉中　敎育，不會有良好收覆。大學的興衰，反映着國家文化的消長，不辛毀於砲火，豈不可惜！國立吉林長白師範學院便是一例。</p>
<p>東大有文·理·農·工·法商五院廿三系，和一個體育專修科，學生二千八百餘名，本期註册的約二千二百名，有些學生到北平去了，有些學生隨家鄉淪陷，另有學生八十五名因共產黨嫌疑，行轅命令其退學。劉校長說：「我很抱歉，學生實際在校的數目頗不詳確，訓育工作成績不好，我不能保證學校裏沒有共產黨。』　兩千多名學生，在素質方面說，是否都是可造就的專材？這就雖說。以各院系人數多少而論，文理兩院學生少，可以看出語文史藝及純粹科學的不受重視，工學院人數甚少，表示東北高中學生程度很低，因工學院取才較嚴格，法商學院則人數最多，近千名，　佔全校二分之一，是否有　收容救濟性質？還是爲畢業後的職業問題限制。</p>
<p>東大窮困得可憐，每月經費兩千萬元，電燈費用去一千二百萬元，敎授宿舍中還吵着沒有電。窮得連考試卷的紙張都發生問題，以致　　待興，他學樓裏沒有一點化　　儀　，　書館　四壁徒立，垃圾堆滿學校，房子解凍漏水毀壞不修。在如此環境中讀書的確太難了，也太苦了，無怪學生嚷着报家。現在學校裏還駐紥砲兵團，前些日子，瀋陽緊張的時候，整天砲聲隆隆，有一個砲兵團的十兵很幽默的對學生說：「請你們不要害怕，我們要開砲了。」直令人啼笑皆非！（本報駐　記者趙展四月二日寄）</p>

<h3 id="c121">柯南特論大學教育 <a href="#c121" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e121" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">121</a></h3>
<p>— 立人</p>
<p>美國哈佛大學校長柯南特氏（Conant）最近有一篇關於哈佛大學的報告。在這篇報告裏，柯氏有幾段泛論大學敎育的話，很値得我們加以注意。以下就打算介紹他這幾段話。</p>
<p>柯南特氏認爲大學乃是學者的集團，爲和平的目標而努力，爲敎學及促進知識而努力的。可是目前分裂的世界，一種武裝休戰的狀態，對於學者們來說，確特別是一種討厭的現象。戰後世界局勢的演變，無疑的對於我們高等敎育投上了黑暗的陰影。現在我們的大學，一如在戰時一樣，有許多必須要替政府做的工作。我們雖很願意做這些工作，而有些工作却並不完全是和平的，也不是愉快的。</p>
<p>在這樣的世界裏，柯氏認爲大學當局及個人有一種明顯的責任，而這種責任就是促進世界文化的交流。國與國間，敎授和學生的交換，應該盡力提倡，熱心進行。次則　，其他民族的文化類型，我們也當努力研究，使我們可以盡量明瞭他國領袖的思想背境或假定。尤其是在所謂鐵幕之後的民族，我們更當明瞭。例如，關於蘇聯方面的根本態度，若有錯誤的假定，這不僅對我們自己是危險，即對於和平也是危險的。所以在今日對於其他民族的文化和意識形態，獲得一種成熟的理解，是最重要，也是最困難的</p>
<p>大學的存在，柯氏認爲可以受人的資助或受人的管制，可是大學並不是政府的機關，也不是私人的集團。大學裏面的敎授並不是僱用的工人。選擇敎授的標準在某一方式上是獨特的。這不能和政府任用官吏的條件混爲一談。有多少很有學問的科學家或哲學家，因為他具有天下一家的理想，也許不能做政府的官吏，去替政府談判條約，可是自他的學問來說，對於大學却是非常有價値的。</p>
<p>在大學裏學者們的活動，柯氏認爲是以自由研究爲其必要的基礎。沒有自由硏究，則你可以有一間高等敎育機關，一問專科學校，或一間軍事學院，你却沒有一間大學。大學是以自由硏究爲必要的條件。這一點我想我們是必須同意的。關於我們民族生活各方面的客觀分析，這是不能有任何障碍的。這雖在武裝休戰的今日，我們也不能犧牲這原則。民族有權要求我們在大學裏的敎授們，對於爭論不決的題目，應成為無畏的眞理追求者，成為謹愼的學者，而不應成為宣傳家。只要敎授們是忠實，誠懇而有能力的話，對於廣泛不同的意見，我們應常加以容忍才是。</p>
<p>以上幾段哈佛大學校長的話，雖是對美國而說，移到我國來是一樣適合的。作者誠心希望我們敎育常局千萬不要忽視這幾段。</p>

<p>— 嚴羣</p>
<p>老子之「道」，實兼體用二者。道之有體用，猶物之有首尾，猶事之有始終，二者相輔相資，缺一則不足以爲道。體，潛能（Potentiality）也，用，效實（Actuality）也，潛能至於效實，自然必然之勢，則道之由體達用，亦自然必然之勢耳。　勢唯何？相反相成，相尅相生，是矣。道之體靜，動其用也；動者靜之反，則道之田體達用，行乎反之勢也。反者有反有所反，二者互更迭代：向之爲反，轉而爲所反，向之爲所反，轉而爲反；——此靜之所以必出於動，動之所以必歸於靜，道之所以由體達用，由用返體，萬物之所以有生滅成毀，人事之所以有治亂興衰，往復循環，周而復始也。夫是之謂道術，道術匪他，道體發動流行而著於用者，其所由之途術是已。道術，老子謂之「勢」，以其自然而必然故。此自然面必然者何？相反相成，相尅相生，而已矣。相反相成，相尅相生，宇宙萬有遝化之極則，其散著於民物者，若生滅，成毀，盈虛，屈直，理亂，興衰，禍福，俱幻，美醜，善惡……其數累累，不勝枚舉也已。</p>
<p>反之勢存於道體之中，故靜必有動，道必由體而達於用。靜與動，體與用，唯其相反相生，是以互爲對待；則無對待之道體實包對待之理。世之請本體者，有難解之問題焉：夫本體之必爲絕對，固矣，而萬有之莫非相對，不可掩之事實也；本體之不動不變，又固矣，而萬有之變動不居，又不可掩之事實也；然則無對待，不變動之本體，焉能演成對待而變動之萬有？以名學言，絕對與相對，靜與動，常與變，皆不相容之槪念，不相容者焉能相生？若希臘之怕兒門尼底士（Permenided），其以「有」（Being）爲本體，亦絕對而靜且常者也，斯宇宙萬物相對而動且變之現象，不可得其解矣；無已，則目之爲「無有」（Not-being），而宇軍論無以立，勉爲級術，若其書所謂「逞臆之途（The　way　of　opinion）者，亦見其蕊須有也已。又如恩魄鐸克類十（Empedocles）之火·氣·水·土，昂那克薩哥拉十（Anaxagoras）之物種，其爲本體亦皆不動不變者也，顧宇宙萬物之生滅成毀，徒徒不動不變之本體不足以使然，乃於本體之外別求其致動之因（Efficierl　or　moving　cause），若恩氏之「愛」「惡」二力，若昂氏之「心」（Nous-mind），是矣。然於本體之外別求動因，則動因與本體相對待，宇宙萬有不獨出於本體，而必濟之以動因，斯其本體非一元者矣。唯老子之「道」實包對待之理，故靜能致動，體能達用，斯一元之本體有以立。何則？變動不居之宇宙萬物，皆於此焉得所自來，有其歸宿，故也。其兼包動靜，體用，之本體旣立，則生滅成毀之宇宙萬物，皆此本體所必致之果，—此余所以謂其若斯之宇宙必出自若斯之本體，其本體論與宇宙觀之所以一貫，而無名學之疵累也。顧其所以如此，亦賴其明夫相兙相生，相反相成之勢，以謂此勢　體之所固有，此勢形，則凡相尅相反之象莫不致其相生相成之效，而萬有出矣。然則此勢實本體宇宙間轉移演進之樞紐；明夫此勢之效，乃老子本體論與宇宙觀之所以一貫，若錘之兩端焉。</p>
<p>嘗淪之，老子之所以能明夫相反相成之勢否，端在觀物察事之際，不囿於人之思路，而直探夫萬有自然之理法。所謂人之思路者，夫人用思所率循之途轍，所謂思律（Law　of　Thought是矣。思律者，（一）即一律（Law　of　Identith），曰：物然者然；（二）相反不相容律（Law　of　Contradiction），曰：物不能亦然亦不然；（三）無兩可律（Law　of　Excluded　Middle），曰：物必或然或不然。思律所明者，一言以蔽之，曰：思之一貫（The　cousistency　of　thought）而已。夫人用思之際，必據其即時即地之觀點，而有所指稱：指物爲甲，則其物之義止於甲，不得兼爲非甲，或徘徊於甲興非甲之間。是知人之觀點有所囿也，所指者然，所不指者非然。然與非然，以人觀之，誠若相反而不相容之者，就物論物，則並爲物而已矣，夫何相反之可言？指物爲馬，其所不指者爲非馬，非馬則牛則羊……，世固無非馬其物也。謂之非馬，觀點所不在，概之以「非」，以別於觀點之所在者耳。物之爲物，在其有別，別或多或少，如熟與冷，其爲別多，熟與溫，其爲別少，固非冷與熱反，溫與熱不反也。與熟反者，唯「非熱」耳，所謂「非熱」，存於人之槪念（Concept）之中，言語之標職，以便運思而已矣，非有物焉爲「非熱」也。物莫不變動流遷，熟散而溫，更散而冷，自然必然之勢也。熟與冷，於槪念判然爲二，在物則一事之原委始終。於槪念爲二者，相反而不相容，於物爲原委始終者，寖假而相及爲；積概念爲思議，爲言語，則以謂相反相及，其實在物誠相及矣，相反則未曾也。老子蓋有見乎此，故其假思路以觀物，資言語　載思也，（知識之事莫能離乎思議之途與言語之具，雖爲所障，無如之何。）乃揭萬化之中相尅相生，相反相及之勢，以見相尅相反之實非相尅相反，而常有一焉以貫之，此一唯何？曰「道一而已。且老子之有見於相反者之相及，以其能破槪念之陣，而得事物之眞，以謂於人若相反者，於事於物實不相反，故能相及：其仍云「相反」者，以常人之言語韶夫常人，唯期共喩而已矣。</p>
<p>唯老子以相反相成之勢觀物察事，其名學輒異乎尋常之名學。尋常之名學以一貫之思律爲始基，老子之名學以相反相成之自然例爲極則；尋常之名學，其一貫在於一時一地之觀點，老子之名學，其一貫存於絕對之道體。觀點，夫人運忠所有事，道體，運化流行之樞機；則老子之名學，非人類求知之法則，乃運化流行之途術，以西哲之術語出之，蓋所謂形而上學之名學（Metaphysicall　ogic）也。</p>

<h3 id="c124">謠言心理（二） <a href="#c124" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e124" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">124</a></h3>
<p>— 方正</p>
<p>謠言的傳播，在心理歷程言，便等於州接連的回憶Serialreproduction。一個模型，在回憶中，逐漸失其本來面目而趨向於某一定型式。誇大，失眞，理解，繁複，便是這項變更中的主流。本文專就這幾點說說。</p>
<p>第一是誇大。例如一九四二年美國有一隻煤船因事外而失事，可是傳說便變成「一隻美國船被魚雷炸沉，船上幾千石看護都遭沒頂」。珍珠港被裴，美國確實有不少的軍艦損失了，但謠言是美國在太平洋的軍艦，全部覆沒。常常祗是一點點的小事，謠言總將它煊染成為了不起的大事情。謠言之爲謠言，便因爲它總是言過其實的。</p>
<p>可是誇大並不一定即是一種變態心理的表現，即所謂誇大在的。這是一般記憶過程所共有的通常現象。例如Gibson實騐一些人對於圖畫的記憶，結果如下：</p>
<p>在第一行中，第一個人因爲對於原圖有『星』的印象，所以回憶便作『星』形，原圖右邊突出的一點便誇大成爲一個大稜角了。第二個人的印象是『飛鳥』，兩旁的翅膀便拖長更顯著了。第三個人的印象是『箭頭』，那右邊突出的一點便伸長成梯形。第四個人的印象是『箭』，那突出的一點竟拉長成箭桿了。第二行的情形亦相彷彿。第三第四兩行，或誇其全（皆合），或誇其分（更歧）。値得注意的是，在實驗的情形下，每一個人都在盡力回憶原圖，心向都是趨於眞實方面的。在努力逼眞的心向下，誇大情形尚且如此，在沒有這種逼真的心情時，誇大的情形便自然更不堪問了。</p>
<p>誇大的結果便是失眞。可是誇大仍多少保存些原來面目，失眞便面目全非了。茲舉劍橋大學Bartlett　敎授的一個實驗爲例。他這一個實騐更接近謠言的性質，因爲他在實驗中採用『人傳人』的接連回憶。原圖是埃及古文的一個字母Ｍnlak，爲西文字母中M的原型。這一個字母經第一個人看過後，他便將它從記憶中描畫出來。這是圖中的『覆1』。第二個人將『覆一』看過後，又復從記憶中將它描畫出來，是爲『覆2』。如此一個一個地傳下去，恰似謠言的傳播般。到第十個人手中，結果便完全變成一隻貓，此後的複寫，事實便有這大出入了。</p>
<p>在上面的一些圖中，有一種趨勢是很値到注意的。這就是生硬的，眞綫式的稜角綫條，都變成很圓滑的，很自然的綫條。更自然，或說更常態化，就是我們所說的第三種趨勢：理解Rationalization。埃及古文的Ｍ原本是『貓頭鷹』的象形文。但這種文字，到底有些勉强，看來有些不大順眼。因此綫條越來越順，細帶越來越有理解。本來斜拖下來的一根綫，慢慢地變成一根尾把，而且越來越低，以後竟完全縮在底下去，過後便藉誇大而又拖成一個長尾把。更有趣的是，原來畫在頭中間的『倒人』字，以後竟演變成爲一個花結子。</p>
<p>在這理解化的過程中又牽進了那第四個趨勢，繁複化Eaboration。陰影的，裝飾的綫條愈來愈多，最後不但全身有毛，並且有鬚有花結了。這是謠言中最常見的『添油加醬』過程。例如謠言為取信起見常常有如此的說法。最初也許祗是『我從人家那裏聽來』，以後便變成『某一個很可靠的人說的』，再變成『某有權威的人設的』，後來便是『某總司令部一個高級職員說的』，再過便變『某總司令說的』，最後或竟變成『某總司令在某處會議時親自向某人說的』。空空洞洞的一個『人家』，最後竟演變成不但有所實指的人，而且有所實指的地與時並塲合了。因此我說謠言有一定的趨向，好像必走向某一定型式的。</p>

<p>— 張其昀</p>
<p>孫仲容先生</p>
<p>孫詒讓字仲容，在清迫光二十八年（一八四八）八月十九日（陽曆九月十六日）誕生於浙江溫州沿海的瑞安縣，去年適爲先生百歲誕辰紀念。淸代中葉，是考證學派全盛時期，在政治上却是海疆多故，世變日亟。他的父親琴西公（衣言）章太炎稱爲晚淸特立之儒，生平盡力表章故鄉的永嘉學派，這是宋代以來浙東學術的重要支派之一。浙東學術的主旨在於繼承中國歷代文獻之傳，融合經義與治道二者，以國事爲己任，通今學古，以期施於世用。同治十一年（一八七二）仲容先生方二十五歲，代琴西公撰宋薛季宣艮齋浪說集叙，（勤備述林卷四）略謂「乾嘉以來，鉅儒輩出，而性理經術各守其家法，不相假借，漢宋之間蓋斷斷如也。衣言曩在京師與方聞之士論當時門戶之弊，常以爲欲　漢宋之長，而通其區畛者，莫如以永嘉之學』。這一段話也是仲容先生自述者學旨趣。就在那年他開始經營他的畢生鉅著「周禮正義」一書，到光緒二十五年（一八九九）先生五十二歲，全書告成，凡八十六卷。後二年，復撰「周禮政要」二卷。先生歿於光緒三十四年（一九〇八）五月二十二日，享壽六十一歲，今年為其逝世四十週年紀念。</p>
<p>周禮初禮周官，是講周代政制最完備的典籍。周禮六篇，各篇之首均以建國二字發端，這是二千年前一部建國經綸。全書體大思精，累數萬言，曠觀世界，罕見其比。這是先秦第一流心智的作品，以史實爲基礎，而以理想彌綸之。其成書年代說者不一，我們試以地理來作印證。是書職方九州，東北有幽州，以今遼寗錦縣附近的　巫閭山爲主由，可見其成書常在燕國勢力達到關外以後，按燕昭王之世（公元元前三一一至二七九年）秦閒為將，擊破東胡，拓地千餘里，置五郡，（上谷，漁陽，右北平，遼西遼東）筆長城以拒胡。燕國拓地在公元第三世紀之初，則職方之作不容更早於此。趙武靈王胡服騎射約在公元前第四世紀末葉，周禮所述仍為車戰，其時代亦不致過後。以此椎斷，周禮作者當爲戰國末年之人物，即在公元前第三世紀，與苟子同時，較之希臘大哲柏拉圖著理想國約遲一世紀。</p>
<p>仲容先生自序謂治周禮應於「古義古制，疏通證明。」考證只是治學的工具。他曾說「承學之士，顧徒奉周經漢注爲考證之淵藪，幾何而不爲已陳之芻狗乎」？（周禮正義序）他把古義和古制分析爲二，古制是爲治之迹，受着時問與空間的限制，後世未必可以施行。古義是爲治之理，凡「政之至精者，必協於羣理之公」，（周禮政要序）這是寰宇的通理，可以放諾四海而皆準。周禮正義的結語，有下列一段話：</p>
<p>「世之君子，有能通天人之故，明治亂之原者，倘能取此經而宣究其說，由古義古制以通政敎之閎意眇指，理董而講貫之，別爲專書，發揮旁通，以俟後聖，而或以不佞此書爲之擁　先導，則私心所企望而且莫遇之者歟。」</p>
<p>仲容先生很自謙，謂「略引其端，而不敢馳騁其說」。實則他的政治思想，在周禮正義的按語中已經隨處流露出來。其後周禮政要一書，有圖表戶版等共四十八篇，發揮得更加充分。</p>
<p>周禮正義草創於同治季年，適在中法戰爭以後，先生自言「睠懷世局，撫卷增喟」。全書告成正是戊戍政變那一年。變法之議始於甲午敗於日本之年，至戊戌而極盛，但遭受了舊勢力的阻撓而頓挫。其時中西新舊之辨，譁然無所適從。仲容先生以爲富强之業本於政敎，「舍政敎而議富强，猶之絕潢斷港而蔪至於海也」。周禮一經集古代政治制度的精華，與近世泰西諾國所以致富强者，脈絡相通。仲容先生稽古論治，分別可變之迹與不易之理，力言中西新故之無異軌，「俾迂固之士廢然自反，無所騰其喙焉」。特於周禮正義寫成以後，再撰周禮政要，以資補充。晚淸思想界由舊轉新的機運，先生誠有莫大之貢獻。中華民國的建立，先生是一位有力的持炬者。（按章太炎寄仲容先生訄書，先生署叙目後曰「辛丑後二百三十八年己亥」。辛丑係順治十八年永歷帝被執之年。又先生題亭林詩集校記後二絕有「臨風掩卷忽長嘆，亡國於今三百年」之句，可謂情見乎辭。）現距先生之歿已四十年，保守派之阻力已不足爲慮。另一派人，往往忽視我國歷史傳統，喪失了民族自信心，輕　華化，而侈談西化，宛如建樓閣於沙上，甚至演成一種離心力量，陷國家於分裂，其足爲新政的阻碍，恐有過於當年的守舊派。常茲憲政肇始，仲容先生畢生硏究之結晶，更値得我們細細領會。作者著有孫詒讓之政治思想一文，分爲（一）統計製圖，（二）基層組織，（三）國民生計，（四）敎育宗旨諸點，略加詮釋，載於浙江學報，茲不備述。</p>

<h3 id="c126">談絕食 <a href="#c126" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e126" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">126</a></h3>
<p>— 靖文</p>
<p>以絕食爲最後抗議手段的印度聖雄甘地已經死了，但絕食的風氣則並未隨甘地而俱終。</p>
<p>民以食爲天，人類的生活原是離不開食的要求的。嬰兒呱呱墮地，就知道索乳。死囚臨上法塲，仍有喝大碗酒喫大塊肉的胃口。世界上一大半的文化成就，大槪都與食的要求有關。而所有的社會問題，歸根結蒂都不外是爲的喫飯問題。淸高如詩人陶淵明，亦曾爲五斗米而折過腰。</p>
<p>喫的問題旣是這樣的重要，而居然仍有許多人願以絕食爲到達目的的最後手段，未免有些不可思議。人也許如宗敎家所說並非單爲麵包而生存，除了基本的食的慾求之外，還有許多更重要的精神上的要求。例如像「失節事大餓死事小」，就是表示在麵包與節氣的權衡中，應該衡　其輕重。以恥食周粟而甘願餓死首陽山的伯夷叔齊，即是一例。</p>
<p>不過絕食的行爲終是一種萬不得已的手段，採取這種手段的人，必須理解他自己所崇奉的精神要求，確有以絕食爲抗爭手段的價値，而且必須能把握得羣衆的同情。因爲絕食本是犧牲的行爲，犧牲是應有價値的，犧牲的原因必須以大衆的利益爲前提，這樣始能以一己的絕食犧牲換取羣衆的力最。</p>
<p>甘地的屢次絕食行爲即具備這些條件。因爲甘地要求印度解放，這是每一個印度人的要求。他的反暴力與無抵抗主義，以當時的印度處境，亦能博取世人同情，因此甘地的絕食是一種具有崇高原因的眞的犧牲。甘地在最後雖非死於絕食而亡於暴徒之手，但他屢次以絕食爲最後抗議手段所表示的堅決意志，終於使今日的印度獲得了獨立。</p>
<p>但一樣是絕食，在有些塲合却並不能博得多數人的同情。醫如有些男女爲了家庭爭吵，亦往往鬧到絕食的程度，雖然其間亦有値得憐憫之處，不過大家一旦心平氣和後，就會發見事情並不需要做到如此嚴重，捨絕食之外的其他解決辦法多的是。</p>
<p>最不能博人同情的絕食行爲，是將絕食作爲達到自私目的的要挾手段。過去舊式家庭的婦女，就喜用一哭二餓三上吊的手段作爲對丈夫的要挾。不過舊式婦女而被迫出此，還有値得同情之處，因爲當時的社會尚不許有「娜拉」這類女子的反抗精神，婦人家爲了爭取丈夫的愛，有時確不得不出此最後手段。</p>
<p>然而若非像甘地一樣處境的人，絕食的行爲究竟是一種下策。事非萬不得已，還以能多喫飯爲妙。因爲如果一面高呼絕食，一面又在喫水果或飲牛奶之類，畢竟是難得人同情的。</p>
<p>鄙憲以爲社會愈進步，以絕食之類手段爲抗爭工具的現象必愈少，譬如在歐美社會中，就不大看見有人絕食，除非逢到齋戒日。他們那裏的工人要求加工鈿，爭改善待遇，大槪都用正面的積極方法，很少有甚麼「餓工」或絕食之類。絕食之類當真幹起來雖然也需要勇氣（像甘地），但究竟是消極行爲。世界上大多數的問題是可以用據理力爭的方法解決的。俗語所謂有理打太公，祗要理由正大光明，人的同情心總會站到你這一面來的。即使這一次爭不成，以後還有的是機會。說句實話，現在世界上絕食而能博到同情的人並不多，據我看就根本祗有甘地一人。</p>

<p>— 迎之</p>
<p>陰雨無俚，聚三五舊游侷促小褸微醺盡歡，亦大佳事。惟酒價日昂，寒傖恐不能辦，不如且讀他人論酒文字。酒之類別至夥，粗別之可分爲燒酒與紹酒二大類，淸人論其優劣者，如徐承烈聽雨軒筆記云：「酒之種類，難以枚舉，而惟燒酒爲最烈，飲或過多，每致焚髮腐腸，可畏也。予昔在廣東，曾飲紅毛燒，色如琥珀，入口甚醇，至腹則心胃間似爲火烙，熱不可忍，雖量巨者不敢盡一合。後客廣西之武緣，其地向以善釀燒酒稱，有單料雙熬三熬四熬等目。單料似吾鄉之麥燒而較醇，雙料則味興猛矣，至三熬，竟不可以口。予嘗試飲一杯，味香而辣，若火綫自喉直通丹田者然，遍身壯熱，醉醄半日而後醒。四熬之色微綠，余不敢嘗，嗅其氣亦足以醉矣。聞其不用米麵，純是雙料所蒸，是以香烈如此。</p>
<p>又云：「黃酒以軍爲佳，而燒酒惟輕爲貴，每罐單料十觔，則雙熬祗重八觔餘，四熬僅五六斤而已。予曾臉之，無少舛錯者。其價雙熬倍單料，三熬則於單料三之，四熬又倍蓰於雙熬，沽者總以單料之値爲標準。人言單料中有覇王鞭（藥名，其本非木非藤，每年僅長一節，如小兒之臂，色靑綠，稜刺四出而無枝葉，破其皮則白脂迸流，人家圃間皆種之，以爲　落，有長至七八尺者），躭此者常病瘋於兩足，雙熬以上則無之，然亦不可得而知也。予在嶺南，惟紹興黃酒是好，而燒酒則不敢常飲」。梁章鉅浪迹叢談記燒酒亦云：「燒酒之名古無可考，始見白香山詩『燒酒初開琥珀光』，則係赤色，非如今之白酒也。元人謂之汗酒，李忠表稱阿刺古酒，作詩云：『年深始得汗酒法，以一當十味且濃』，則眞今之燒酒矣。今人謂之氣酒，即汗酒也。今谷地皆有燒酒，而以高粱所釀爲最正，北方之柿酒，潞酒，汾酒，皆高粱所爲，而水味不同，酒力亦因之各判。嘗聞外番人言：『中國有一至寳，而人不知服」，即謂高粱燒酒也。並敎人服食之法，須於每夜子亥之間，從朦朧睡夢中起服此酒一盃，以薄肴佐之，服訖仍復盹去，大有補益」。章鉅亦自云：「以仕官勞碌之身，亥子間未必都能就枕，且溫洲進看，起居服侍，亦難得此恰當之人」，乃適有先意承志之「山左屬令」，授以夜半服食之法，不煩人力，恬適自如，「每當寒宵長夜，服此尤有風趣」，遂「自山左即如法行之，迄今將二十年」。又其浪跡叢談，歸田瑣記諸書記藥酒方頗多，謂屠蘇亦藥酒，想見此老浸沉食餌之老官僚作風，大是聵聵。然其亦能知紹興，如叢談云：「今紹興酒通行海內，可謂酒之正宗，而亦有橫生訾議者，其於紹興酒之至佳者實未曾到口也。世人每笑紹興酒亦不過常酒，而販運竟徧寰區，且遠達及新疆絕域。平心而論，……酒之通行，則實無他酒足以相抗，蓋山陰會稽之間，水最宜酒，易地則不能爲良，故他府皆有紹興人如法製釀，而水旣不同，味即遠遜；即紹興本地，佳酒亦不易得，惟所販愈遠則愈佳，蓋非至佳者亦不能行遠。余嘗蕩甘隴撫桂林，所得酒皆絕美，雖嘉　關以外則愈佳；若中土近地，則非藏蓄數年者不堪入口。最佳者名女兒酒，相傳富家養女，　彌　即開釀數　，直至此女出門，即以此酒陪嫁，則至近亦十許年。其　率以彩繪，名曰花雕。近作僞者多，竟有用花罐裝　　凡酒以欺人者。凡辨酒之法，罐以輕爲貴，蓋酒愈陳則愈縮歛，甚有縮至半罐者，從罐底以錐敲之，眞者其聲濟越，僞而敗者其響必不揚。甚有以小錐刺罐，瀉出好酒，而以水灌還之者，視其外依然花雕，而一文不値矣。凡蓄酒之法，必擇平實之地，用木板襯之。若在浮地屢搖之，則踰月即壞。又忌居濕地，久則酒味易變。凡烹酒之法，必用熱水溫之。貯酒以銀瓶爲上，磁瓶次之，錫瓶爲下。凡酒以初溫爲美，重溫則味减；若急切供客，隔火溫之，其味雖勝，而其性較熱，於口體非宜。」其他關於酒之品評雜話，淸人筆記如閱微草堂，隨園食單，歸里淸譚，蘭芷零香錄……等多有記述，亦不乏酒之史料也。</p>

<p>林肯是一個苦出身的總統，他誕生於一座木房子裏，不過，誕生於木屋的美國總統並非僅祗林肯一人，傑克遜，戴勒，飛爾摩爾，巴區南和茄斐爾德等人都是如此的。哈禮遜總統在競選宜傳中也說是出世於太屋，其實，他誕生於浮吉尼亞州的一幢漂亮的華厦中。</p>
<p>通常都認爲華盛頓是美國最富有的總統，其實，胡佛才是總統中的首富，他現在還在紐約最豪華的阿爾道夫旅館開有長期房間。林肯雖窮却儉，他死後遺有財產十一萬零九百七十四元。華盛頓做了兩任總統，一文官俸也未支取。范·布倫總統是於任滿時一次支取全部薪水的。傑弗遜和格蘭特兩位總統的身世最爲蕭條，死得不名一文。</p>
<p>戴勒總統因中暑而死，哈利孫總統則因受寒而死，不過兩個人都易簣於白宮，可謂死得其所。哈禮遜在就職檢閱典禮中，不戴帽子也未穿大衣，騎在馬背上檢閱軍隊，於是受寒死了。戴勒在酷熱的陽光下安放了華盛頓紀念碑的基石後，喝了一些冷牛奶，又吃了一碗新鮮的漿果，暑氣逼人再加上飲食不愼，駕歸白宮後竟然一病不起了。</p>

<p>— 東方</p>
<p>托爾斯泰原小屠格涅夫十歲，但因他的巨著「戰爭與和平」一書問世後，他的文名就遠較屠氏爲盛，因此他們倆人之間便常起齟齬了，當然這兩位大作家齟齬的起因，乃是由於秉賦氣質不同所致，却並非爲了嫉忌之故。</p>
<p>有一次，他們兩人同去拜訪一個友人，席間談起了屠氏的親女的敎養問題，屠氏就竭力地誇讚他那個英國女敎師的賢德和優良的敎育法，而且說：她又勸導我的女兒，使她親手去爲窮人補破衣服了。」</p>
<p>而托氏却認爲幾乎忘了自己的語言而受外國敎育是可厭的，他說：「我認爲一個女孩子，自己却打扮得漂漂亮亮，而手裏却拿着破衣服，這種行爲像一齣舞台上的滑稽戯，是不誠實的。」</p>
<p>「那麽，你認爲我的敎育女兒，是敎育壞了嗎？一屠格湼夫氣憤的說。</p>
<p>「這句話，才是言行一致的。」托氏却依舊泰然地回答。</p>
<p>「你再這樣說，我就鎚扁你的頭！」屠格湼夫盛怒的說着，說完以後就飛快地跑開了，宴會便這樣的不歡而散。</p>
<p>在回去的路上，托氏寫信給屠氏要他道歉，因爲回信的延誤，更使托氏發怒，才將決鬥書送給了屠氏，但是屠氏的覆信，直到以後才被收到了的。</p>
<p>這個狂怒的決門；於在傳遞信件延誤之下，始終沒右實現。這椿事情的發生是在西曆一八六一年，還不到四側月的時開，托爾斯泰就爲這椿不愉快的事情後悔了，這時，由於屠格湼夫的遠居巴黎，所以這兩位大作家直到一八七八年間才相互諒解，和好如初。</p>

<p>[Special Dispatch from Our Nanjing Office, 5th] The National Assembly Presidium was formally established on the 5th. The 85 chairpersons were inaugurated in the afternoon, and the general assembly agenda will commence on the 6th. The results of the Presidium election were announced during the sixth preparatory meeting, which resumed at 4:50 PM on the 5th. When Secretary-General Hong Lanyou, acting on the instructions of Chairman Mo Dehui, reported the election results, he first read the report submitted by the supervisors, including Liu Jiwen, designated by the temporary chairman, regarding the supervision, voting, and ballot counting process. A total of 2,339 ballots were issued today, distributed on a district basis and deposited into twelve ballot boxes. Upon inspection during the count, 2,333 ballots were found, with the missing six presumably abstentions. Twelve ballots were questionable; after detailed verification, five were deemed invalid. Thus, the total number of valid ballots was 2,328. The ballots were opened and verified on the spot without error. Eighty-five people were elected. In cases of equal votes, precedence was given according to the number of strokes in their surnames. The 31 individuals following the 85 elected were designated as alternates. In cases of equal votes among alternates, the order was determined by lot drawing by the chief supervisor. After reading the names in full, each elected chairman was invited to the rostrum to formally take office. Temporary Chairman Mo Dehui then announced the formal establishment of the National Assembly Presidium, concluding the mission of the temporary chairman and temporary secretary-general. The conduct of the assembly will be the responsibility of the Presidium. The meeting adjourned at 5:15 PM, marking the end of the preparatory meeting.</p>

<p>[Special Dispatch from Our Nanjing Office, 5th] The sixth preparatory meeting of the National Assembly was held at 9:40 AM on the 5th, attended by 2,080 representatives. Mo Dehui served as temporary chairman and read the memorandum from Secretary-General Hong Lanyou requesting punishment for electoral misconduct. The content briefly stated: "During the proceedings of the fifth preparatory meeting, due to improper distribution of ballots by the meeting staff, some were unable to obtain ballots. In the candidate roster, the names of representatives were omitted due to erroneous explanations by the staff. Lanyou failed to supervise effectively and is undeniably at fault. In addition to severely punishing the meeting staff, I request severe punishment from the assembly to clarify responsibility." After reading, Mo stated: "Secretary-General Hong has worked diligently day and night since the preparation of the assembly. Should his request for punishment be waived?" The entire assembly unanimously applauded in agreement. Subsequently, the Secretary-General announced the list of candidates and letters from candidates Mo Dehui, Chen Bulei, Lin Zigui, Wang Yizhai, Zhou Shiguang, Zhu Jingnong, Su Lianyuan, and Chen Ce, all declaring their withdrawal from candidacy. Together with the 18 individuals, including He Longzhang and Zhang Shengyi, who requested withdrawal in the previous meeting, the total reached over 30 people. In the candidate list, Dai Xingti was nominated to participate in the candidacy for the fisheries group due to Gu Zhenggang's withdrawal. Therefore, only four groups, Dalian, Hankou, Shenyang, and Xi'an, were not selected from the 67 units. In total, there were 63 candidates. For those representatives who have already announced their withdrawal from candidacy, whether they can still obtain elected status was explained by the Secretary-General according to law that their candidate status should be cancelled. However, due to the overly cursory nature of some representatives' applications, the Secretary-General specifically declared that representatives should write a formal certificate of renunciation of election after voting and submit it to the Secretariat for processing in accordance with regulations.</p>
<p>At 10:05, the meeting agenda proceeded to the "Re-election of the Assembly Presidium Proposal." The Secretary-General first announced that apart from representatives and meeting staff, guests and reporters should leave the venue, and the doors of the venue would be temporarily closed, suspending entry and exit, and late representatives would be temporarily delayed from entering the venue. At this time, the Secretariat's notices were posted inside the venue and at the doors of the venue, explaining the situation. Subsequently, someone proposed that late representatives should be allowed to enter the venue. It was decided to open one door to allow entry. Representative Pan Gongzhan also suggested that this door should also be allowed for entry, and no one should leave the door before the voting procedure is completed. At 10:25, the Secretary-General announced the number of people in attendance and explained that the ballot papers for the re-election were different from the previous ballot papers to avoid errors. The voting and ballot-counting supervisors were asked to assume their duties, and the venue was divided into twelve areas (eight areas downstairs and four areas upstairs). The venue staff were responsible for distributing ballots in each area. Ballot distribution began at 10:30. Due to the continued arrival of people after the meeting, the number of attendees reached 2,269 by the time of voting, and a total of 2,269 ballots were issued. At 11:55, the representatives left the venue after voting according to the district method. Due to the secret deployment in advance, there may have been delays in time, but the order and procedures were orderly.</p>

<p>The ballot counting process also went well. At that time, all supervisors were present to monitor the ballot counting by the meeting staff. The supervisors publicly nominated Liu Jiwen as the chief supervisor. Secretary-General Hong Lanyou was also present to assist. After the ballot boxes were moved from the meeting venue to the ballot counting area, each ballot box was unsealed by two supervisors, who first checked the number of ballots and reported to the chief supervisor. Then the ballots were divided into six groups, and the chief ballot distributor distributed them to the group leaders, who then distributed them to the ballot distributors in each group. Each tally clerk was responsible for counting five candidates. There were a total of twelve ballot boxes, which were processed in two groups. Invalid ballots were discarded. The counting was completed at 2:20 PM. Yu Youren, with the most votes of 55, became the first person elected as Chairman of the Presidium.</p>

<p>[Special Dispatch from Our Nanjing Office, 5th] The solution to the problem of signing representatives has been drafted after research by Mo Dehui, Hu Shi, Yu Bin, and Chen Lifu, and has been submitted to the Chairman by Chen Lifu. It is reported that this plan is for Chairman Jiang to request the National Assembly Presidium in the name of the Chairman to allow the signing representatives to attend, and then the Assembly will decide on the formal attendance method, which will be submitted for discussion at the official National Assembly. On the 5th, all eight fasting representatives were injected with glucose by Dr. Hua Shujun and slightly consumed milk.</p>

<h3 id="e7">National Assembly Proceedings - Finally Emerge After a Thousand Calls <a href="#e7" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c7" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">7</a></h3>
<p>Special Report from Our Newspaper (April 5th, Nanjing)</p>
<p>At precisely 5:00 PM on the afternoon of the 5th, at the resumed sixth preparatory meeting of the National Assembly, Mr. Liu (Dehui) announced: "The elected representatives of the Presidium will take office immediately." This was followed by loud applause. Then, Secretary-General Hong called out the names one by one. Amidst the waves of applause, the chairpersons took the stage one after another, yielding and smiling. A golden-lettered red ribbon was added to their chests, and they lined up in two rows in front of the chairman's desk. Mr. Liu then flashed out from the crowd, stepped to the podium, and calmly said: "The mission of the temporary chairman and temporary secretary-general is over, we can adjourn the meeting." The Presidium, after a thousand calls, was finally produced, and the National Assembly can now move into the formal agenda.</p>
<p>The National Assembly held six preparatory meetings, five of which were argued for the election of the Presidium. Later, the organizational law was amended, the number of people was increased, and the election method was amended. By the fifth preparatory meeting on the 3rd, it seemed that nine out of ten ballots had been cast. Unexpectedly, due to two technical problems, the first election was invalidated, and it was delayed for another two nights. The first technical problem was that the name of He Zhonghan was missing from the candidate names printed on the ballot. It turned out that Mr. Zhao Hengti, the convener of the Hunan unit, forgot to send the candidate nomination and recommendation letter to the Secretariat of the Preparatory Committee, causing Hong Lanyou to be unjustly scolded. It was not until the evening of the 4th that Mr. Zhao found the recommendation letter, and the problem was solved, and the misunderstanding disappeared. The Hunan representatives felt apologetic. The second problem was that the ballots were in short supply due to the chaos in the order. This and the previous problem made the meeting on the 3rd a mess, and the meeting on the 5th was therefore even more tense.</p>
<p>Walking into the venue on the morning of the 5th, one could see twelve ballot boxes neatly arranged at the end of the chairman's table, which were the invalid ballots from the 3rd. The meeting staff controlled an unprecedented pile of meeting agendas, distributing them to the representatives who forgot to collect them when entering the venue, because the agenda contained the list of all candidates. After Mr. Mo Liu read Hong Lanyou's document requesting punishment for "ineffective supervision" on the 3rd, he added: "Everyone is responsible for what happened on the 3rd." He pleaded for Hong to be excused from punishment. Hong Lanyou more painstakingly read the list of candidates. Then the Fisheries Association nominated Dai Xingti as a unit candidate to fill the vacancy left by Gu Zhenggang. Mo Dehui, Chen Bulei, Chen Ce and other nineteen candidates successively gave up their election.</p>
<p>At exactly 10:00 AM, Hong Lanyou once again followed the method of previous years, inviting guests, reporters, translators, attendants, and all non-official members of the assembly to leave, and late representatives were temporarily locked outside the door. Withdrew together were the twelve invalid ballot boxes on the rostrum, and twelve new ballot boxes had already been placed at the exit of the venue.</p>
<p>Hong Lanyou had now become a commander who was determined to win. He divided the entire venue into twelve "major defense zones," four upstairs and eight downstairs. In each "major defense zone," there were many small grids divided into four rows, and representatives designated as voting supervisors were assigned two people in each "major defense zone" to "supervise the battle." There were designated personnel responsible for both the small grids and major areas, which was entirely a "mechanized" system.</p>
<p>After about three quarters of an hour, everything was arranged. Hong gave the order.</p>
<p>"The meeting staff issuing ballots, listen to my report and issue the ballots together!"</p>
<p>"If the ballot boxes are blocking the way, move them away!"</p>
<p>"Representatives, please do not leave your seats immediately after the election!"</p>
<p>The meeting staff, as if facing a formidable enemy, repeatedly checked the number of representatives in attendance, totaling 2,339. At 10:50, some representatives who were waiting anxiously were already making a little noise. Hong Lanyou gave an order and began to issue ballots at high speed. The ballots were yellow, so there was no way to confuse them with the white invalid ballots of the 3rd. Ten minutes later, the election was over.</p>
<p>At 11:30, the ballot boxes, which had been sealed for less than two hours, were opened again under the mercury lights and cameras. The first step was to check the ballots in six units. The supervisors took out the ballots one by one and handed them to the staff to sort them out and count them. After completing this task at high speed in twenty minutes, the supervisors Ouyang Lun, with his arms open and his face flushed, smiled and said, "My arms are really sore!" The second step was to check the invalid ballots. Among the 2,333 ballots, there were twelve questionable ballots, and after identification, five were invalid ballots. The third step was to distribute the ballots to the staff who were in charge of five candidates each for individual calculation. By 2:00 PM, all the sub-counts were completed, and then they were arranged in order of the number of votes. Among them, the same number of votes was determined by the number of strokes in the surname. Among the 195 candidates, only 129 received votes, and 66 even voted for others with their own votes. It was all in vain to find people to sign and recommend them on the morning of the 3rd.</p>
<p>Among the 85 elected people, the most votes were for Ziyouren and Gu Zhenggang, with 55 votes, and the least were for Gao Wei and Zhang Boling, with 11 votes.</p>
<p>At 3:00 PM, the Secretariat completed the roster, and the supervisors drafted the report. The task was accomplished, and everyone in the venue was hungry and exhausted, slouching in front of the dining table. Hong Lanyou couldn't even eat, and his steps were even more unsteady; only the chief supervisor, Liu Jiwen, picked up a piece of braised pork knuckle with his chopsticks and said, "I'm not nervous, so I'm not tired!" He is really a good midwife!" But a pregnant female staff member on the long chair was already leaning against the back of the chair and sleeping.</p>
<p>What a difficult birth of the Presidium, it finally came out after a thousand calls!</p>

<p>[United Press, Beidun, 4th] Moscow Radio broadcast on the 4th that regarding the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs' second protest against the Soviet patrol aircraft shooting down a Chinese civilian aviation team aircraft near Lushun on March 8, the Soviet Union submitted another response on April 3, rejecting it. The Soviet Union's response stated that "the Soviet Union has difficulty agreeing to China's sovereignty to enjoy freedom of action in various parts of Northeast China," and stated: "The Chinese aircraft was flying over the Soviet military area in Lushun. According to the Sino-Soviet Treaty of 1945, the Soviet Union enjoys certain rights there.

<p>[Central News Agency, Qingdao, 5th] A U.S. naval transport plane stationed in Qingdao crashed due to engine failure during a training flight on the 5th and was forced to land in a rice field in Gaoji, 18 miles west of Qingdao. It is reported that the area is a communist bandit activity area. There were four people on board, including pilots.

<p>[Special Dispatch from Our Nanjing Office, 5th] Regarding President Jiang's expression of unwillingness to participate in the presidential election, the Kuomintang Central Standing Committee held an emergency meeting at 3:00 PM on the 5th to discuss it based on the resolution of the Provisional Plenary Session. The emergency Central Standing Committee was chaired by Sun Ke, and the members conducted research on the President's humility from various aspects, paying particular attention to the reactions of all parties. Zhang Qun immediately reported on the expression of support for the President made by the leaders of the Youth Party. The members, considering the current difficulties facing the country and assessing the current situation, believed that the position of President could not be adequately filled by anyone other than the President to lead the country through this crisis. In order to express the unanimous support of the entire party, it was decided again to solemnly support the President's candidacy for the first President, and it was suggested that the Provisional Plenary Session adopt it on the 6th. Shao Lizi and others were appointed to visit the President immediately to explain this opinion. The emergency Central Standing Committee meeting lasted for more than four hours, and all important officials spoke enthusiastically. It adjourned at 5:30 PM in the afternoon.</p>

<p>[Special Dispatch from Our Nanjing Office, 5th] After the news that President Jiang announced his unwillingness to participate in the presidential election spread, it did not seem to affect the determination of the general public to support President Jiang to assume the first presidential office. When social elites Mo Dehui held a press conference at 2:00 PM on the 5th, reporters asked him about his feelings about President Jiang's unwillingness to run for election. Mo firmly replied: "The current national situation really requires Mr. Jiang to serve as President. It can also be said that it is Mr. Jiang's inescapable duty to serve as President. Mr. Jiang's humility is a virtue of the Chinese people, but no matter what, the colleagues of the National Assembly will definitely elect Mr. Jiang as President." Hu Shi, the president of Peking University, also said when answering reporters' questions at the National Assembly Hall on the 5th: "I have decided to sign a nomination to support President Jiang's candidacy for President." Zhang Boling, president of Nankai University, told reporters on the morning of the 5th that the situation in China is so difficult that it is difficult to predict what the country will be like in the future if President Jiang is unwilling to run for President, and anyone who is President will have difficulties in the current situation, but only President Jiang can lead through this difficult situation.</p>
<p>Youth Party Formally Expresses Request for the President to Assume Difficult Responsibilities</p>
<p>[Another Cable] On the 5th, after the news that President Jiang announced his unwillingness to participate in the presidential election was reported, Zeng Qi and Chen Qitian of the Youth Party immediately inquired about the truth from Executive Yuan President Zhang Qun by telephone. Zeng and others expressed great concern after reading the report, because the party had decided to support President Jiang to serve as the President of this term. President Zhang then relayed President Jiang's sincere remarks made at the Kuomintang Provisional Central Plenary Session on the 4th, saying that the President was very firm in his intention, but people within the Kuomintang still unanimously urged the President to stand for election. Zeng and others said: "The country is in turmoil, and the future responsibilities are arduous. Apart from the President, no one can be competent. The Youth Party has long been determined to support President Jiang as the first President. The Youth Party's National Assembly representatives will participate in the nomination of President Jiang as a presidential candidate and unanimously vote to elect President Jiang." Please ask President Zhang to convey this intention to the Kuomintang Central Committee. Zhang presented the above process when he attended the emergency Central Standing Committee meeting at 3:00 PM on the afternoon of the 5th.</p>
<p>People From the Democratic Socialist Party Say That President Jiang Should Not Humbly Withdraw</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper News] Regarding President Jiang's unwillingness to participate in this presidential election, people from the Democratic Socialist Party believe that the President's concession is indeed sincere, but given the President's high prestige, if he is willing to take actual responsibility and serve as the President of the Executive Yuan, the position of President will inevitably become difficult to produce; at the same time, the President's expression the other day was only his personal opinion, and given the severity of the current situation, the Kuomintang will never let him humbly withdraw. All important officials of the Democratic Socialist Party, including Zhang Junmai, refused to make public statements on this matter, and even after the Central Standing Committee meeting, they did not intend to make any public statements on the presidential election. A member of the Standing Committee of the Party told reporters yesterday: "We believe that the presidential election should not become a matter of discussion, because it can only be the President; what is worth studying is the Vice Presidential candidate."</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 5th] All the National Assembly representatives from Guangxi held a meeting on the 5th and unanimously decided to telegraph President Jiang, supporting him to assume the office of the first President to comfort the people's expectations.</p>
<p>President of the Shanghai American Chamber of Commerce Talks - Says the President is the Popular Choice</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper News] In order to understand the reaction of the American community to President Jiang's unwillingness to run for President, the reporter especially visited Mr. Xie Gai, President of the American Chamber of Commerce in the city. He was very cautious in his attitude and only allowed to express his personal opinion, briefly saying: "Apart from President Jiang, no one can gain the trust of the people of the country. I believe that the candidate for the future President of your country should have the strength to control the various forces in the country, and there is no need to worry about his international reputation. The leader of China only needs to be supported by the Chinese people, and whether the United States, Britain or other countries are satisfied is irrelevant." Asked whether Dr. Hu Shi would be a suitable candidate for President, he replied: "I have never met Dr. Hu, and this is a matter of your country's internal affairs. I am too ignorant of this matter to make any criticism. I personally believe that if Dr. Hu can serve as the President of the Executive Yuan, it can indicate a major step in China's internal reform." The reporter asked again, if the President insists on not running for President, who would be a more ideal candidate to stand for election? He replied: "We believe that Mr. Song Ziwen is quite capable, but we do not know what his reputation is in the country."</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 4th] U.S. officials here today are awaiting accurate factual evidence regarding President Jiang's abandonment of his presidential candidacy. Well-informed sources say that the U.S. government believes that the so-called President Jiang's unwillingness to be re-elected under China's new constitution is "impossible at present."</p>

<h3 id="e13">Appeasement and Flattery <a href="#e13" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c13" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">13</a></h3>
<p>— Wang Pingling</p>
<p>Recently, after reading the articles of some experts, it is really ridiculous, such as Mr. He Yongji's "A Chat Over Wine," which is one example. I have been troubled by the bizarre theories secreted from the minds of this kind of experts. Although I want to "ignore them accordingly," I always feel like there is a fishbone in my throat, and I have to spit it out to feel better.</p>
<p>According to Mr. He's statement, the Chinese Communist Party is originally a traditional "local product" of China, and there is no so-called "Marxism-Leninism," with very little international flavor. At most, it is just a "peasant uprising" in the style of the Bronze Horse and the Red Eyebrows... If the United States lends money to China to help China "suppress the rebellion," it will force the "local" CCP to turn to the Soviet Union and accelerate the arrival of the Third World War. This is really obliterating the facts and dreaming with open eyes. Except for Mr. Wallace, who regards it as a confidant and listens with relish, I believe that as long as Americans who understand the situation slightly, at most they will just smile it off! Mr. He underestimates the CCP and looks down on the CCP. He really does not understand the CCP!</p>
<p>Mr. He also believes that as long as Wallace regains the power of the United States, the disputes between the United States and the Soviet Union can be easily resolved. What is his magic weapon for solving it? According to the results of their discussion that night, it is probably to first rely on Mr. Wallace's personality to guarantee and gain the trust of the other party, and then take the lead in thoroughly removing the United States' national defense. If appeasement is not enough, then continue with flattery, and achieve the United States' disguised "unconditional surrender," then big things can be turned into small things, and small things can be turned into nothing. However, whether Americans are willing to let Mr. Wallace use the United States, which has been painstakingly managed by countless patriots and benevolent people since Washington founded the country, as a tool to test his ambitions is a question. Even if Wallace really has such a day to express the policy of "appeasement and flattery" to the extent that he is satisfied, whether he can win the satisfaction of the other party is still uncertain!</p>
<p>To be honest, the postwar world is devastated, and who does not desire construction. The people who are alive at this moment have already tasted the taste of war, and who does not pray for peace. However, to strive for construction and peace, if the stupid method of "appeasement and flattery" is adopted, the most basic condition is that one party must be willing to sacrifice endlessly, and the other party's desire can be stopped appropriately; one party must be willing to make a big step back, and the other party's pace must stop at a stage that is considered satisfactory, and decide not to "take an inch after gaining an inch." Is this possible in the purely "stake-related" interaction between countries? Even if one party is willing to back down, who can guarantee that the other party can know when to be satisfied? If they can never be satisfied, what reliable good policies can reduce the other party's desires?</p>
<p>When World War I ended, the British were indeed able to maintain their traditional "gentlemanly demeanor" and first fulfill the resolutions of the "Naval Reduction Conference" and implement the "doctrine of appeasement" by taking the lead; but Hitler accepted the British appeasement and increasingly expanded his ambitions for aggression. On the eve of World War II, Chamberlain already knew the ineffectiveness of "appeasement." Not only did he not condescend to Munich to flatter, who knew that the more respectful and sincere the attitude of flattery, the faster and more thoroughly the powder keg of World War II would explode. Yin Jian is not far away, and the past can be learned. In today's society where humanity is declining and silence is rampant, if there is not enough hard power to stop the impulsive bestiality, it is impossible to imagine how terrible the holocaust of mankind will evolve. The heartbreaking and shocking tragedy played in human history really makes me doubt Mencius's theory of inherent goodness. Seeing the roundaboutness but not being relevant to the matter, I have to admit that Xunzi and Hobbes's advocacy of the theory of "inherent evil" is closer to the truth of reality. According to Hobbes's philosophy, the so-called human kindness and international peace are essentially the result of mutual use and equal strength. People's efforts are to extend the peaceful situation, under the precarious cliff that is constantly trembling and always in danger of breaking, intermittently. As long as one party's strength is slightly different and cannot stabilize the balanced scale, it can affect the whole body and destroy the entire system and order. At that time, all calls for benevolence, justice, and morality have become nonsense and cannot save the holocaust of mankind. Hobbes ruthlessly pointed out that human nature has this weakness that leads to destruction, which naturally makes people tremble and fear; but in general, the pitiful lambs, in order to escape destruction, bow down to the man-eating tigers and flatter them in every possible way, wagging their tails and begging for mercy. How stupid is this? Wells, in his book "The Shape of Things to Come," once said: "The penguins that became extinct in the modern animal kingdom did so because they did not dare to face the cruelty of the enemy and save themselves as a group; but when their brothers were swallowed by giant beasts or raptors, they chanted beautiful songs on the beach, opened their beautiful wings, danced and sang, and exhausted their talents to entertain the enemies who slaughtered their brothers, hoping not to eat themselves. As a result, after eating their brothers, they ate themselves, and were finally eaten up. There were no survivors, and it was only reduced to a term in zoology." I never thought that today some experts who consider themselves wise have their wisdom even below that of extinct penguins!</p>
<p>If the world sincerely wants to avoid the possible catastrophe, it must no longer use the stupid method of "appeasement and flattery" to create the form of "man-made knives and saws, and I am the fish and meat." It is only possible to overcome all its own weaknesses as much as possible, so that the other party is impeccable and absolutely cannot find the weakest link. Only in this way can everyone find a gap for self-reflection in the dilemma of persisting without decision and falling into a stalemate, recall the lost humanity, and then from the perspective of interests, know yourself and the other party, weigh the pros and cons, even when it is unbearable, they still dare not compete, and if they want to compete, they will die together. Extending it to the point where each other is exhausted and disheartened, the mood of mankind has changed from unusual to normal, and from tension to relaxation. Perhaps they can say with an understanding heart and a smile, "Forget it, forget it." Then, they will be willing to settle down and find another rational solution.</p>
<p>The current situation is as if the various planets of the nebula have just formed and have not yet stepped on the orbits of non-interference and balanced attraction. From war to victory, it takes eight years, then from victory to peace, it may take twice as long to achieve it. Today, the opposition between two very different ideas and ways of life can be regarded as the misfortune of mankind, but it is not the "preservative" of mankind. As long as it is used well and the balance of the scales is kept stable, not only is there no danger, it is very likely to be used as an element to promote human progress. But if one party intends to use the stupid method of "appeasement and flattery" and sell feelings for peace, then it is undoubtedly opening up weaknesses and giving others an opportunity to take advantage of. Since people have knives and saws in their hands, why not slaughter fish and meat to enrich themselves!</p>

<p>[Our Fuzhou Dispatch, 5th] Sa Zhenbing, a veteran of the Navy, held his ninetieth birthday celebration today, and the city of Rong was more grand than ever. In the early morning, various newspapers published congratulatory words and birthday news from the "Ten Fujian Longevity Stars" in red. Around 8:00, the Rescue Fire United Association's Birthday Hall on auspicious mountain was filled with crowds coming and going to pay their respects and watch the festivities. The decoration of the Birthday Hall was magnificent, with a plaque of "High Morality and Long Life" written by President Chiang of the National Government and presented by the Navy Commander-in-Chief Gui Yongqing hanging above the main entrance, and sixteen birthday screens written by the whole army to the side. Around 10:00, officials from the Navy Headquarters and the Provincial Government, as well as leaders from all walks of life, rushed to pay their respects. Military music was melodious in the Birthday Hall, and fire trucks from the city roared and set off firecrackers outside the hall to show their support. Sa Lao was welcomed back by Chairman Liu's special car last night, and was surrounded by reporters when they came to see him, with a humble face and a very happy expression. Today also happened to be the spring break, and there were many students, civil servants, and villagers watching, totaling no less than 10,000 people.</p>

Sa Lao told reporters: "The country is currently facing difficult times. I am very uneasy about people from inside and outside the province celebrating my birthday. I am old now, but I dare not forget the affairs of the country. I hope that my compatriots will love and unite each other to jointly complete the great cause of nation-building."</p>

County Magistrate Tian Zhi expressed his regret and proclaimed a rigorous 25% rent reduction on the eve of his departure to Nanjing to attend the National Assembly. However, after Tian left for Nanjing, Chen Huimin, an instructor of the county government, was still in the countryside, threatening Deng and Deng Dilong, Qin, the head of the township farmers' association, and others in various ways, leading armed forces to arrest people everywhere, creating an atmosphere of terror. Furthermore, the Yixian County Council submitted a document to the Provincial Council, but due to negative public opinion, although ten copies had been printed, they were not distributed. Commissioner Li summoned Meng Aoyun, the chairman of the county farmers' association, on the 4th, expressed his regret for the Deng case, and expressed his willingness to take full responsibility for handling the aftermath, and guaranteed the safety of the leaders of the farmers' associations at all levels, and resumed the activities of the township farmers' associations, which were on the verge of stagnation.</p>
<h3 id="e39">On the Jinghan Railway <a href="#e39" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c39" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">39</a></h3>
<p>— Our Central China War Zone Correspondent, Bu Mian</p>
<p>[Our Hankou Dispatch, 4th] This is already the season when the earth returns to spring, but the weather has suddenly turned cold in recent days, and the spring rains have indeed shattered people's long-awaited "dream of spring." People have temporarily shrunk back into an atmosphere like the remnants of winter, and spring seems even more distant. The reporter stayed in Nanjing for six days, and it was either cloudy or rainy. There was only one complete sunny day, and that was on the day of the Yellow Flower Mound Martyrs' Memorial Day, which was also the day the National Assembly opened. The blue sky presented its original smile, bringing a ray of sunshine, and at the same time, a warm-hearted welcoming song of spring to the lips of spring tourists who were in groups.</p>
<p>Small Scenes of Wuhu</p>
<p>Wuhu is the first stop on the Jinghan Railway. The reporter stayed here for one night. Finally, the ship arrived slowly, but it was already 11 p.m. when it arrived in Wuhu. In the anemic electric light, only a vague outline of the city could be seen. The prices of daily necessities are lower than in Nanjing and Shanghai. First-class machine rice is 3.25 million per dan, the best flour is 1.76 million per dan, pork is 60,000 per jin, beef is 40,000 per jin, chicken eggs are 5,000 each, and cabbage or spinach is 5-6,000 per jin. There are six or seven entertainment venues, including three cinemas, mostly showing domestic films that have already been shown in Shanghai, such as "The Black-Clad Girl," "Remembering Jiangnan," and "Talented Men and Beautiful Women." Tickets are not expensive, 20,000 per ticket. One cinema offered preferential treatment to the audience on the "March 29th" Memorial Day, selling tickets for only 13,000. Peking opera theaters are all located in tea houses, where you can drink tea and listen to opera. Only the Guangdong Restaurant has two singers, who can be considered Wuhu's only "singing orioles," broadcasting Shanghai songs there. Although there are several newspapers, their circulation is very poor, and the price is particularly high, selling for 10,000 per sheet, and twice as expensive on the ship. One newspaper, the Fuxing Daily, has a unique layout, which is rare even in the whole country. It places the supplement in the lower right corner of the first page, occupying a quarter of the space, with the remaining three-quarters being advertisements. I dare not assert whether this is due to the small size of the newspaper or the way it is laid out. Anqing is the second stop. The ship did not stop, but only a glimpse of the capital city of Anhui was taken in a hurry.</p>
<p>A Quick Look at Jiujiang</p>
<p>Although the ship only stopped in Jiujiang for 90 minutes, fortunately the daylight helped a lot, allowing me to see it in a short hour and a half. Stepping onto the streets of Jiujiang, I was reminded of the Nanshi district of Shanghai. Apart from a few roads being neater and wider than Nanshi, everything else is not as prosperous as Nanshi. There are no cars to be seen on the roads, and even rickshaws are few and far between. The shops selling porcelain are the most numerous, and their business is also very slow. Only some transit passengers from Nanjing and Shanghai to Yuehan patronize them, but after all, they are limited. Every shop has its doors open on the outside, but in reality, it is no different from being "closed." There is only one theater in the whole city, the Rongyu Peking Opera Theater. Although the tickets are not expensive, the audience is not crowded. There is only one small newspaper, which maintains publication using wartime cooked paper due to the high cost of paper, and the price is equal to that of major newspapers in Shanghai. Prices are lower than in Wuhu. Machine rice is 2.9 million per dan. A plate of stir-fried shredded pork is twice as large as in Nanjing and Shanghai, and sells for only 80,000. A bowl of noodles only costs 20,000. Porcelain is not cheap, which is unexpected. A small teapot costs at least 160,000, and there are even more expensive ones. Taking a quick look at Jiujiang, what I saw in that instant may have been the outer layer of the outer layer of Jiujiang.</p>
<p>The journey on the Jinghan Railway usually takes three days, but this time it was delayed due to fog, exceeding the scheduled voyage by one day. After four days of tedious life on the ship, I gradually recovered from the tedium and fatigue and stepped onto the land of Hankou.</p>
<h3 id="e40">Offering Remote Sacrifices to the Yellow Emperor and Lu Xiufu <a href="#e40" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c40" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">40</a></h3>
<p>— Zhang Zhaorong</p>
<p>The Yellow Emperor's Mausoleum is located in the central part of Shaanxi County, now renamed Huangling County. The mausoleum is located where the mountain is uplifted and water surrounds it, shaped like a bridge, hence the name Qiaoling. Sima Qian's Historical Records says: "The Yellow Emperor collapsed and was buried in Qiaoshan", referring to today's Qiaoling. Qiaoling Mountain is towering, with thousands of mountains surrounding it, magnificent in scale, and dotted with ancient cypresses, making the scenery particularly beautiful. In front of the Xuanyuan Temple, there is an ancient cypress tree that can be embraced by seven people, said to be planted by the Yellow Emperor himself. Emperor Wu of Han sought immortality and once built a platform here. To this day, there is a cypress tree with numerous nail marks, said to be the tree that Emperor Wu hung his clothes on. In front of the mausoleum is a stele with the words "Yellow Emperor's Mausoleum" personally inscribed by Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, the handwriting is elegant. Huangling is not only a historical site but also a scenic spot. In order to honor the virtues of our ancestors, the central government usually sends senior officials every year to pay homage to the mausoleum. This year, due to the impact of war and transportation, we can only offer remote sacrifices in Xi'an. Thinking of this, I can't help but feel emotional.</p>
<p>The Yellow Emperor is the ancestor of our nation. He created writing, made boats and armies, created crowns and robes, managed utensils, built palaces, minted currency, invented silk, wrote medical scriptures, set laws and rules, divided and appointed officials, and established the nation. His contribution to the cultural survival of the Chinese nation is of great merit and can be verified in history. Even after becoming the emperor, "when the world was not obedient, the Yellow Emperor followed and conquered it, pacified it, opened mountains and roads, and never lived in peace. He went east to the sea, climbed Wanshan Mountain, and reached Daitong, west to Kongtong, climbed Jitou, south to the Jiang River, climbed Xiongxiang, and north to drive away the Hunzhu, and united the symbols in Fushan." His career was extremely prosperous, so later generations all regarded themselves as his descendants, so as not to forget the virtues of their ancestors.</p>
<p>Last year, on Qingming Festival, I accompanied Inspector Tian Jiongjin, Mayor Wang Youzhen, Director Jiang Jianren, and others to worship there. After the worship, I had a conversation with the gentlemen about the Huangling construction plan, because the central government had instructed the Shaanxi Provincial Government to prepare construction opinions, and Director Jiang was consulting on this matter. In my opinion, the scale of Huangling's construction should be larger than that of Sun Yat-sen's Mausoleum, and its scenery should be better than that of Tan Mu, because the Yellow Emperor's achievements are no less than those of Mr. Sun Yat-sen, and it is appropriate to have a national and international building for the admiration of future generations, and to show the long history and broad culture of our nation to friendly countries. The mountains and rivers in the area are beautiful, and with artificial arrangements, it can naturally be far better than the tomb road of Mr. Tan Zu'an. As for the construction plan, I suggest that professors and colleagues from the civil engineering, water conservancy, mechanical, electrical, and mining departments of the Northwest Institute of Technology form an inspection team to figure out how to achieve architectural grandeur, how to use nearby rivers to build reservoirs and fountains to enhance the beauty, how to extend the steel road to Yan'an to facilitate transportation, and how to develop nearby mineral resources and establish industries to prosper Shaanxi Province. All of these require careful planning by experts, and the raising of funds is also an important issue. In my opinion, the descendants of Yan and Huang will all be happy to donate to build the ancestral mausoleum. Therefore, once it is called for, the source of funds will be very easy to obtain. If each person bears an average of 10,000 yuan, the amount collected by 450 million compatriots at home and abroad will be considerable. However, this matter must be initiated by the central government and followed by various places, and technical issues should also be paid attention to. Once the mausoleum is completed, representatives should be sent from each province to pay homage every Qingming Festival, and international figures are also welcome to participate. A university should also be established near the park to commemorate it. If this can be done, the future development will be unlimited.</p>
<p>Not long ago, the Luochuan War broke out, and Huangling was also heard to have been occupied. The Communist Party is doing everything possible to destroy our country's inherent culture. The location of the mausoleum must be ominous. I am saddened by this! Huangling is a holy place, and it must not be allowed to be destroyed or damaged by bandits. Our army is now gathered in Xi'an and should be recovered as soon as possible, so as not to let down the spirits of our ancestors in heaven.</p>
<p>In the past, the Yellow Emperor cultivated virtue and invigorated the army, managed the five qi, cultivated the five grains, comforted the people, measured the four directions, taught the abilities of bears, panthers, tigers, and Pi Xiu, conquered enemies, and laid the foundation for the survival of future generations. Today, the survival of the nation is in peril. Internal strife must be quelled quickly, and the people must be allowed to recuperate and rest, promote the entrepreneurial spirit of our ancestors, cultivate civilization, train the three armies, and complete the pacification of the chaos as soon as possible. This is an urgent task.</p>
<p>History says that "in the Yellow Emperor's time, people did not die young, officials were not selfish, markets did not speculate, cities were not closed, and villages had no thieves. People yielded wealth to each other, the wind and rain were timely, the five grains were harvested, and the distant countries of barbarians all offered their tributes." Looking at the world today, people are dying one after another, corruption is rampant, thieves are rising, the government and the public are only competing for profit, and the international status is plummeting. How can we face them? Therefore, we must work hard to govern the country, and the rulers must take the lead in advocating the governance of the Yellow Emperor's prosperous era as the goal of future efforts.</p>
<p>The 5th is the National Tomb Sweeping Day, offering remote sacrifices to Huangling, and all kinds of feelings are intertwined. I therefore dipped my brush in ink to express my sentiments.</p>

<h3 id="e41">Strengthening Military and Police Forces to Ensure Public Security; France and Italy Adopt Emergency Measures; Anti-Communist Elements in Rome March and Demonstrate <a href="#e41" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c41" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">41</a></h3>
<p>[United Press, Rome, 5th] The Italian government held a grand parade of 20,000 police officers and soldiers yesterday, watched by 500,000 people. This event, taking place seven days before the general election, was clearly intended to demonstrate force to the Communist Party. This was the largest parade since Mussolini's demonstration to Hitler in 1936. The previous parade was a diplomatic maneuver, while this parade was a public display of the army's support for Prime Minister Gasperi. Many important officials from the Soviet Union, Poland, Yugoslavia, Britain, France, and the United States attended and reviewed the parade. At the same time, the Secretary-General of the Italian Communist Party, Duggati, claimed that hundreds of thousands of voters in southern Italy, traditionally anti-communist, will cast their votes for the left-wing front, which will determine the political direction of the country.</p>
<p>[United Press, Gorizia, 4th] More than 4,000 Italian anti-communists dispersed a planned Communist rally in the Santo Antonio Square today, then staged their own demonstration, singing the national anthem. The crowd then advanced from the square towards the Yugoslav border, where they were intercepted and dispersed by a large contingent of riot police, without any brawls or bloodshed. At the same time, anti-communists in Rome staged armed parades in the city center in response to the Communist Party's show of force. As the election date approaches, candidates from various parties are addressing voters in every town and village throughout the country.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Paris, 4th] Officials here announced that France is organizing 50 companies of the Republican Security Force to assist the police in maintaining national security and order, and to protect the country's airfields, ports, railways, and borders. These security forces are commanded by a general headquarters, which is divided into nine command posts. It is generally believed that this move by the government is to prevent the Communist Party from launching strikes this summer.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Paris, 4th] Interior Minister Moch gave a speech in Sete on the Mediterranean coast today, warning the Communists that if they launch strikes again, the government will deal with them with strong measures. He pointed out that the strikes in November and December of last year were launched by the Communist Party on the orders of the Communist Information Bureau. Recently, social activities have also occurred simultaneously in France and northern Italy, often supported by foreigners participating in the Soviet Overseas Chinese Association, the French Polish Workers' Party, and the Free Italian Movement. Although France is still willing to accept every foreigner who wishes to come to work, France requires them not to interfere in France's internal affairs and to allow the French to resolve their disputes themselves. The French have learned a lesson in November and December of last year and are now better prepared and organized and will be able to smoothly protect the order of the Republic.</p>

<p>[United Press, Berlin, 5th] The tense situation caused by the Soviet "blockade" of Berlin is easing as Soviet Commander-in-Chief Sokolovsky accepts an invitation from British Commander-in-Chief Robertson. At this banquet, it may be possible to resolve all issues over a glass of wine, although most people remain pessimistic. Robertson invited Sokolovsky to dinner on Tuesday, with British Chief of Staff Field Marshal Montgomery as a distinguished guest. It is expected that US Commander-in-Chief General Clay and French Commander-in-Chief Juniich will also attend.</p>
<p>[United Press, Berlin, 5th] The Allied military authorities today accepted the Soviet Union's proposal to negotiate land traffic control issues and advocated convening a four-power conference of Britain, the United States, France, and the Soviet Union to discuss the matter. If the Soviet Union agrees, this will be the first meeting of the four powers on German control since the Soviet Union withdrew from the Allied Control Council on the 20th of last month. At the same time, although all passenger trains are still suspended today, freight trains are now entering Berlin.</p>
<p>[United Press, Berlin, 4th] US Chief of Staff Gai Lai and Soviet Deputy Commander Tratewen exchanged notes today, agreeing to immediately negotiate the Soviet land traffic control issue. At the same time, the US military authorities ordered the suspension of food airlift to Berlin. The emergency situation in Berlin for the past two weeks has thus eased slightly. The Soviet side also presented the same note to Britain and France, but Britain and France have not yet responded. Tratewen also said that he would try to alleviate some of the difficulties in passenger and freight transportation, but insisted that the current control regulations could not be changed. Gai replied that he was willing to discuss the matter, but it was difficult to accept the Soviet army's boarding and inspection of trains in its occupation zone. The Soviet note denied the existence of any agreement allowing Western countries free use of the highways and railways between its occupation zone and Berlin, claiming that due to the lack of traffic control, unscrupulous elements took the opportunity to engage in various speculation and illegal activities, resulting in numerous crimes in the Soviet occupation zone. Western countries are not overly optimistic about the Soviet Union's proposal to hold negotiations. It is the first time since the 4th that there have been no US, British, or French troops stationed at the highway checkpoints here. Only the highway to Yuhauno, and one single-track railway between Berlin and West Germany are still checked by Soviet troops.</p>

<p>(10) The Burma Pipeline Plan</p>
<p>The short-sightedness of the China-Burma-India Theater Command can be seen in its attitude towards the pipeline that ran through Burma.</p>
<p>Defenders of Stilwell seem to be justified, believing that, if nothing else, this pipeline alone proves that he was wholeheartedly committed to the significance of the Burma campaign.</p>
<p>In fact, the pipeline plan was conceived by the Chinese National Defense Supplies Commission, which was established in the United States a few months before the Pearl Harbor incident and was once rejected by Stilwell.</p>
<p>In the summer of 1941, before the Japanese occupied Burma, engineers from Shell Oil Company designed a readily portable pipeline and advocated laying it along the old Burma Road. This design was submitted to the Army Engineers in Washington, who used it, but it was not used in Burma at the time. The Japanese fully controlled the area by June 1942.</p>
<p>Personnel in the Theater Command did not consider the pipeline plan until the end of 1942. At the end of 1942, the Chinese National Defense Supplies Commission and Lend-Lease representatives mentioned the plan to General Hearn, the commander of Stilwell's advance echelon in Chongqing. They suggested that it be included in the Burma operation plan that Stilwell was drafting at the time. They made a formal proposal.</p>
<p>When the plan was presented to Stilwell, he did not approve of it. I was told that when a representative of the Chinese National Defense Supplies Commission later wanted to argue the case, he refused to discuss the matter.</p>
<p>Stilwell's reaction was reportedly: "I don't want any damned pipelines -- all I want are bullets, just bullets."</p>
<p>I believe that the pipeline plan was finally incorporated into the Burma operation plan due to the insistence of General Sherman Vael, the supply chief in Washington. This was a military necessity. Without this plan, the value of the Burma Road to China would not be as great as adding a batch of transport planes flying over the Hump.</p>
<p>I have always believed that the Theater Command's first priority should be to expand the air transport facilities flying over the Hump as much as possible. Even after the Burma Road and pipeline were both functioning, most of what we obtained still came from the air.</p>
<p>But Stilwell believed that air transport over the Hump was a competition to his Burma Road plan. Until the middle stages of his Burma operation, the work of airlifting supplies became a fairly important factor for the success of his operation. Without the airlift, including the airlift of oil pipelines, the pipeline project and other aspects of the Burma operation, including the Chinese army crossing the Nu River to launch an offensive, would have failed midway.</p>
<p>It is worth noting that when Stilwell advanced in northern Burma and built the new overland Ledo Road, the results proved that it could not meet the needs of his offensive, even though the stated reason for opening the road was to transport goods to China.</p>
<p>Initially, in 1942, the U.S. airlift operation over the Hump was not valued by the China-Burma-India Theater Command. The responsible parties were not able to clearly recognize the importance of the airlift operation within China.</p>
<p>Officials from the Chinese National Defense Supplies Commission wanted to increase the tonnage of air cargo in 1942. General Bissell, representing Stilwell, told them that he estimated that if they wanted to transport 5,000 tons of cargo per month, they would need 25 large airfields and 300 aircraft in the Kunming area. In 1945, when the war ended, the cargo carried over the Hump each month showed the fragility of this estimate.</p>
<p>But Bissell's conservative attitude, based on his own experience, was not without reason. Before him, and before the Air Transport Command took over in 1942, General Clayton, who was responsible for the airlift operation over the Hump in the Theater Command, also had a conservative attitude.</p>
<p>In that year, the China National Aviation Corporation's airlift operation over the Hump had already exceeded the U.S. Army transport aircraft by a considerable amount. Stilwell had agreed to reduce the number of U.S. Army transport planes from 100 to 25, as ordered by the Air Force Command, on the grounds that the Hump route was not practical. When the Hump airlift operation was transferred to the Air Transport Command, it was opposed by the Theater Command to no avail.</p>
<p>In the months after the transfer of the Hump transport operation, the monthly transport volume was between 1,200 tons and 2,500 tons, and it remained so until the summer of 1943. General Stilwell did not seem to feel dissatisfied.</p>
<p>But I was dissatisfied. The Hump transport operation was directly related to all my efforts to make the Chinese Air Force Squadron and later the 14th Air Force an effective weapon. I was forced to believe that Stilwell only wanted to transport a few hundred tons of bombs, ammunition, fuel, and parts to China each month via air transport.</p>
<p>It was this effort to maintain the minimum strength of the Chinese Air Force that caused me to argue with Stilwell and Bissell in January 1943. At that time, the monthly supply of fuel and gasoline to the Chinese Air Force Squadron was about 750 tons, but Stilwell wanted to cut it in half.</p>
<p>Careful study showed that doing so would force the Chinese Air Force Squadron to abandon not only the offensive but also the air defense of various parts of China, except for the Chinese Air Force Squadron Command and Kunming, the main terminal of the Hump airlift route. At the same time, a considerable amount of cargo transported from the Hump was piling up at Yunnanyi, west of Kunming, and within the bombing range of Japanese aircraft in Burma and Indochina.</p>
<p>When I told General Bissell that reducing supplies would only allow me to defend Kunming, he replied that I must defend Yunnanyi. I could only reply that I did not know how to get the planes to take off without fuel.</p>
<p>So I flew to Chongqing to explain it to Stilwell in person. He verbally ordered me to stop the defense of Yunnanyi. I asked him to put it in writing, but he did not do so. But the next morning, I reversed the order and restored the cargo tonnage that had been cut.</p>

<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 5th] The passenger and freight fares on the Beijing-Shanghai and Tianjin-Pukou railways have been adjusted again, and many members of the Control Yuan have expressed their dissatisfaction.

If rice merchants have inventory that cannot be sold, the committee may purchase it at market transaction prices, paying 80% of the total price first, and the remaining 20% after delivery. The purpose of this plan is not only to ensure smooth sources but also to enrich the committee's rice reserves so that it can supply rice at any time in case of market panic, thereby regulating the market. However, to implement this plan, a large amount of funds must first be prepared for purchases at any time, so it is still awaiting Director Wu of the Social Affairs Bureau to return to Shanghai from Nanjing for further discussion.</p>
<p>Review Work: Holding a Conference</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] The Public Opinion Committee has decided to hold a work review conference every Sunday. The fourth conference was held the day before yesterday, and the conference thoroughly discussed the time for issuing certificates, the speed of rice collection, the payment situation, and the calculation methods of rice quantity. At the end, Director Tuo instructed on the implementation methods for the distribution of cooking oil this month, and the meeting adjourned at around 12 o'clock.</p>
<p>Rice Allocated to Nanjing: Contract Signed</p>
<p>Regarding the allocation of 90,000 dan of rice by the Public Opinion Committee to the Nanjing Public Opinion Committee, the contract was completed yesterday morning by Director Ren of the Public Opinion Committee and Xie Zhengfu, Director of the Nanjing Municipal Social Affairs Bureau, at the Central Bank. According to the person in charge of the Public Opinion Committee, most of this rice is Wuhu rice, which was purchased by the committee through the China National Cereals, Oils and Foodstuffs Corporation. At present, it will be temporarily allocated to the Nanjing Public Opinion Committee for application, so the price has not been discussed.</p>

<p>Faithless Wife's Evidence Is Conclusive</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] In the case of the marital discord between General Wang Zhuo and his wife Du Qin, Du Qin and her lover Tan Yuehan were prosecuted by the District Prosecutor's Office for adultery. The case has been transferred to the Criminal Court of the District Court for trial by Judge Zhong Xianda. The indictment stated briefly that Wang and Du were married in the 24th year of the Republic, and their relationship was not bad after marriage. After the outbreak of the Anti-Japanese War, Wang suffered serious injuries in air combat and went to Hong Kong for recuperation. Later, in the 119th year of the Republic, he met Tan Yuehan, a Cantonese who worked in the Ministry of Economic Affairs, on the same ship. Because Wang's hearing in one ear was severely impaired and one eye was blind, Du was induced by Tan, and the two developed a relationship. Since then, they eloped several times. In November of the 35th year of the Republic, Du left home again and fled to Tianjin, where she lived with Tan Yuehan in Tianjin. Later, Tan was sent to the United States by the ministry. Wang tracked her down to Tianjin and found Du back. However, the relationship between the two had broken down, and they eventually became involved in litigation. Wang presented the love letters and joint photos between Tan and Du to the court, accusing them of harming the family, and summoned Du Qin to confess that she had had a relationship with Tan. The evidence of adultery is conclusive, and a public prosecution should be filed. Du Qin is still in custody.</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] A child named Gao Genfa, ten years old, from Jiangsu, lived at No. 43, Yexin Lane, West Guangfu Road. Yesterday afternoon at around 5:40, he went to the Generalissimo Park with his friend Zhang Maotou. When they were lingering in the zoo, they saw two bears active in the wire mesh. Gao was inspired and climbed a short wall next to him and stepped on the wire mesh. Unexpectedly, he was fiercely bitten on the left leg by the bear, which refused to let go. The child cried for help in pain. After tourists and gardeners used all means for about half an hour, he finally got away, but most of the flesh on the child's leg had been bitten off. He fell into a coma. After being sent to Tongren Second Hospital, according to the doctor's diagnosis, the leg had to be amputated. Just as the operation was about to be performed, he died of excessive bleeding.</p>
<h3 id="e74">Golden Coffin for Jin Jinbo's Remains: Family Seeks Spiritual Comfort; Lawyer Wang Writes to the Laozha Police Station, Presenting Two Points for Further Investigation <a href="#e74" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c74" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">74</a></h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] The remains of Jin Jinbo, a councilor of Wenling County who died in a car accident on Nanjing Road, were buried in a golden coffin at the Leyuan Funeral Home at 3 pm yesterday. The owner of the car involved in the accident, Dacheng Silk Weaving Factory, also sent someone to pay condolences and express their apologies to Jin's family. It is said that the factory owner Song Baolin is not currently in Shanghai and has telegraphed him to return to Shanghai to discuss the aftermath.</p>
<p>The reporter also visited Lawyer Wang Jian'e, who was hired by Jin's family. According to reports, Lawyer Wang has sent a letter to the Laozha Police Sub-bureau in charge of the case yesterday, raising two points: (1) Please check the machinery of the car involved in the accident to see if there are any situations that should be repaired but are not repaired. (2) According to the usual examples of car accidents, the car should immediately brake after running over a person. However, this car continued to slide for more than 30 feet after hitting a person and then ran over another person, which is very strange. It should be noted whether the driver of the car is mentally unsound or has other reasons. According to Lawyer Wang, Jin Jinbo's family does not focus on monetary and material compensation, what they need is spiritual comfort. They also hope that this tragedy will awaken the authorities' attention, strengthen vehicle control, improve traffic, and protect the safety of pedestrians. As for the legal responsibility, in addition to the driver's criminal responsibility for causing death due to negligence in business (maximum sentence of five years) and the car owner's civil responsibility for compensation, if the car's machinery is indeed damaged, the car owner should also bear the criminal responsibility for "not paying attention" under criminal law.</p>
<p>Driver Involved in Accident Sent to District Prosecutor's Office</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] The Laozha Police Sub-bureau yesterday escorted Yang Songyuan, the driver involved in the accident, to the District Prosecutor's Office, requesting an extension of the detention for five days. The prosecutor questioned him briefly and approved the extension of the detention. He was still taken back by the Laozha Sub-bureau. Yesterday morning, Prosecutor Ding Tongjun went to the morgue on Changde Road to examine the body. According to the prosecutor, the car was driving too fast and avoided too quickly, causing it to rush onto the sidewalk and become uncontrollable. The driver of the car cannot shirk his responsibility.</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] Zhang Jia'ao, President of the Central Bank, was sued to the District Court by someone, and Judge Cao Zuwei is in charge of the trial, which is scheduled to open on the 8th of this month. It is reported that Li Changqing, a police officer of the Central Bank, hit and injured Li Yunbin, a trainee at the Central Police Academy, while riding a bicycle on Suzhou Creek Road on December 23 last year. After being sent to the hospital for treatment, he spent 80 million yuan on medical expenses and borrowed 5.5 taels of gold. Li Yunbin sued Li Changqing to the District Court for negligent injury and requested compensation for losses. The District Court repeatedly summoned the defendant but he failed to appear. The plaintiff believes that Zhang Jia'ao, the legal representative of the Central Bank, did not supervise strictly, causing the police officer to cause trouble outside and then be unscrupulous and refuse to respond to the summons. He has added Zhang as the second defendant.</p>
<h3 id="e76">Allegations of Corruption in the Fisheries Management Office: The Post-War Relief and Rehabilitation Administration will Send Personnel to Investigate Thoroughly <a href="#e76" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c76" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">76</a></h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] The day before yesterday, a newspaper published a news article about the "Dark Secrets and Numerous Malpractices" of the Fisheries Management Office of the Custody Committee of the Executive Yuan's Post-War Relief and Rehabilitation Administration, which ran for thousands of words and revealed eight major points of the Fisheries Management Office's main crimes. Yesterday, the reporter specifically inquired Zhao Junmai, the current director of the Fisheries Management Office, about this matter. According to Zhao, the points mentioned in the news article are inconsistent with the facts. Yesterday also happened to be the weekly routine meeting of the responsible supervisors of the office, and all supervisors of various units were present. At that time, this issue was raised at the meeting. After research, it was confirmed that it was inaccurate. The reporter further inquired whether the Control Yuan had sent personnel to investigate. Zhao said that the investigation by the Control Yuan was indeed a fact, but the committee member had returned to Nanjing after investigating that the points reported were inconsistent with the facts. As for the report that Director Zhao himself topped up a foreign house, according to Zhao, the house he currently lives in is an ordinary apartment. Whether there is a foreign house, the facts can prove it. He himself is unwilling to make any statements or corrections on this case, but welcomes people from all walks of life to visit or investigate the office on Fuxing Island at any time to clarify the truth. As for the attacks on the past directors, he cannot answer and can let them express their opinions themselves.</p>
<p>The reporter also inquired the Custody Committee of the Post-War Relief and Rehabilitation Administration for their opinions. According to reports, the Fisheries Management Office was previously managed by the Executive Headquarters. Now that the Executive Headquarters has ended, the Post-War Relief and Rehabilitation Administration is a new organization and does not know the situation of the past Executive Headquarters in detail. However, the committee will send personnel to thoroughly investigate the various points of corruption in the Fisheries Management Office reported in the newspaper.</p>

<h3 id="e78">National Government Cables Request for Detention Too Late: Renault and His Party Leave Japan for the East <a href="#e78" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c78" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">78</a></h3>
<p>[Reuters Nanjing, 5th] The Chinese government has requested General MacArthur to escort Renault and his party, who left China on the afternoon of the 4th without the permission of the Chinese authorities, back to Shanghai. The US Air Force authorities stationed in Japan asked the Chinese government whether it wished to detain Renault and his party or send them back to China. The Chinese government's reply requested that Renault and others be extradited to China. The reasons for this are that Renault and others did not settle their outstanding affairs when they left Shanghai on the 4th, did not fulfill the routine customs procedures, and broke their promise to the Chinese side that they would not leave China until the entire issue of the exploration plan was resolved, which was a violation of China's sovereignty. After consultation between the Ministry of Communications and the Civil Aviation Administration, it was decided to request the Allied Headquarters to order Renault and others to return to China.</p>
<p>[Associated Press Tokyo, 5th] Renault took off in the "Explorer" plane from Haneda Airport here at 7:30 pm on the 5th (6:30 pm Shanghai time). The pilot was still Orton. The Allied Headquarters had approved him to continue flying in advance. Renault said that he would take a short break in Midway Island, then go to Hawaii to pick up his wife and two grandchildren, and then fly back to Chicago from San Francisco.</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] Mr. Xie Gai, President of the American Chamber of Commerce in this city, met with our newspaper's reporter yesterday and commented on the Renault incident: "I hope Chinese people will not regard Renault as a typical representative of all American businessmen in China. Renault is really a fool and a madman. He only hopes that his name will be in the newspaper, regardless of the content of the news. This matter is quite detrimental to the reputation of American businessmen in China. As the president of the American Chamber of Commerce, I feel very embarrassed after this incident. When I met with the US Consul General this morning, I frankly stated that in the future, the State Department should be more cautious when issuing passports than in the past to avoid similar incidents. In the future, if someone comes to China to conduct exploration and other plans, the methods and expenses should first be reported to the relevant US agencies for safekeeping and supervision. Otherwise, a madman like Renault may reappear. There are many valuable exploration groups in the international community, and Renault has greatly hindered them, because China has expressed suspicion of such groups because of this incident. Finally, I hope that the State Department can take a firm position on this bad deed."</p>
<p>[Associated Press Washington, 5th] State Department officials said on the 5th that they have asked the US Embassy in China to report in detail the situation that occurred in Shanghai with Renault. They refused to comment on Renault's "escape from China" before receiving the report.</p>
<p>Insulting Our Country: Making Wild Accusations</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] After escaping to Tokyo, Renault made wild accusations, insulting our side for "fabricating charges and attempting to extort money." He also lied that when his exploration plane took off, our airport guards fired shots, and our air force "rushed to chase." The Shanghai office of the Civil Aviation Administration solemnly denied Renault's rumours yesterday.</p>
<p>[United Press Tokyo, 5th] Renault flew to here from Shanghai last night without permission. He said that this escape was to avoid "financial bankruptcy." He also said, "Chinese guards held guns to prevent him and three crew members from boarding the plane. They followed me closely. I threw out fifty pens, which hit the door. The driver Auden started the engine and flew off the runway, and the guards dispersed."</p>
<p>Admitting to Breaching Promises</p>
<p>[Another Dispatch] Renault said that he would meet with the US Air Force Commander in the Far East today to complete the formalities for flying back to the United States. When Renault heard the reprimand from Jiang Bentong, the head of the Chinese Mount Jishi exploration team, he said: "Of course, I violated every promise I made to him in China. Under the shadow of coercion and light machine guns, I will always violate my promises. When I made promises to Mr. Sa, armed guards surrounded my plane, and I and my crew members were detained. This action violated the agreement and had no proper legal procedures. The only way I can get away is to allow them everything. I have to allow them in the past, present, and future in order to escape their grasp. As for my passport, it was forcibly taken away. They gave me a receipt. The Chinese side must explain what crime I have committed, and must not be vague."</p>
<p>Willing to Repay Our Debts</p>
<p>Renault also said that he came to Japan this time without a passport and owed China 53 million yuan, which he would send a check to repay. At the beginning, he was "forced to do" the exploration work, "they increased the personnel and expenses, and I had to agree."</p>
<p>No Bullet Holes in the Fuselage</p>
<p>[Associated Press Tokyo, 5th] US officials here on the 5th refused to comment on Renault's "escape" from China's absurd matter and frankly admitted that they were very puzzled by the international twists and turns caused by the flight. Renault's telegraph operator Lear said: "When the 'Explorer' plane took off from Longhua Airport, Chinese police fired shots." However, US Air Force officials said on the morning of the 5th that after a detailed inspection, there were no bullet holes or other damage on the fuselage. There would be no problem for Renault and his party to fly back to the United States, because he only violated Chinese law. However, people with good information believe that the United States will not go beyond its authority to enforce the law for China. Renault telegraphed his wife and the factory director of the ballpoint pen factory, Lamb, to report his safety and said that he would be returning soon.</p>
<p>Renault took a photo with Jiang Bentong in Nanjing on the 3rd when he made a promise, and left without saying goodbye the next day.</p>

<h3 id="e87">Ministry Order to Halt Deferred Settlement Business; Hua Stocks See Universal Catastrophic Decline Yesterday; All Futures Stocks Drop to Limit, Fourteen Spot Stocks Drop to Limit <a href="#e87" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c87" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">87</a></h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] The local stock exchange received an order yesterday to ban deferred settlement business, resulting in a universal catastrophic decline in Hua stocks. As a result, fourteen spot stocks dropped to the limit, and all futures stocks dropped to the limit. Yong Yarn opened in the morning at 1407 yuan, hitting the limit, and there was even less trading in the afternoon. Yong Yarn was offered for sale at 1360 yuan, causing considerable public anxiety.</p>
<p>The financial and economic ministries' resident supervisory officials at the local stock exchange received instructions from the two ministries on the 3rd, stipulating four points (as seen on the first page of yesterday's newspaper). In addition to informing the Shanghai Municipal Government by telegram, they were instructed to immediately direct the stock exchange to ban deferred settlement business. Supervisory officials Wang and Li of the stock exchange notified the exchange authorities to take note and implement the instructions. The stock exchange officially announced the two ministries' ban in the market yesterday morning and stipulated that new deferred settlement transactions would be suspended starting from the morning market on April 5, 1948. Liquidation transactions could be conducted until the morning market on April 7 (Wednesday). All outstanding balances would still be settled on the originally agreed-upon date of April 9 (Friday). The stock exchange authorities also convened a meeting with the responsible directors of the Brokers' Association to explain the two ministries' regulations on banning deferred settlement transactions.</p>
<p>The Brokers' Association convened an extraordinary meeting of the standing directors at approximately 1:00 PM to discuss how to handle discrepancies in deferred settlement balances. At approximately 4:00 PM, they consulted with the stock exchange authorities again. It was ultimately decided that for all transactions in which brokers liquidate existing mutually offsetting deferred settlement positions on behalf of their clients, resulting in discrepancies in balances, a cash margin of 50% of the principal evidence would still be collected according to the original method. The balance limit for each broker would still be 20 billion national currency. In addition to the official announcement by the stock exchange, the Brokers' Association also sent circulars to all firms last night to take note, immediately comply, and liquidate deferred settlement transactions.</p>
<p>The Hua stock market was greatly intimidated by the suspension of deferred settlement at the beginning of the morning. The spot and deferred Yong Yarn opened at the limit, and the deferred Yong Yarn was even lower than the limit. After the opening, short sellers rushed to cover their positions, and the price once rose to 1495 yuan, the same price as the spot and deferred price. However, it immediately declared a limit down due to numerous sales. Yong Gong, Qin Xing, Xin He, Zui Lun, Match, Xinhua, Sino-French, and Xin Guang all declared a limit down. Except for Yong Yarn, Xin He, Xin Guang, Match, Yong Gong, Jing Yun, Qin Xing, and Sino-French, which remained at the limit down, Zhabei, Tong Yi, Business, Central Silk, and Xinhua rebounded after the limit down. China Cement fell by half a percentage point, Rong Feng, Li An, and Hua Xin fell by 10%, and National Goods fell by half. In deferred settlement stocks, Xin Guang fell by 10%, and Yong Yarn, Xin He, and Qin Xing hit the limit.</p>
<p>The situation worsened, and Yong Yarn remained at the limit. Subsequently, the trading volume became smaller and smaller. Except for China Cement, Lian Di, Rong Feng, Da Tong, Tong Yi, and Heng Feng, which did not hit the limit, Yong Ye and Xin Yi had no transactions, all others hit the limit. The immediate Yong Yarn even fell to 1350 yuan, which was comparable to the morning closing price of immediate Heng Feng. Hua Xin, Rong Feng, and Li An experienced a slight decline, Da Tong and Tong Yi fell by half a percentage point, and all others hit the limit. All deferred settlement stocks hit the limit. Most of the over-the-counter, unlisted stocks were flat and weak.</p>

<h3 id="e89">The Ministry of Finance Has Not Explicitly Stipulated the Location for Exchanging US Dollar Bonds <a href="#e89" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c89" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">89</a></h3>
<p>Only a Small Number Flow to Southern China</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] National Bank personnel stated: The Ministry of Finance has not made any explicit regulations regarding where maturing US dollar bonds can be exchanged, so they can be exchanged anywhere in the country. Furthermore, holders of the 1947 US dollar bonds that have matured, have wired the principal and interest to Southern China, effectively becoming a disguised outflow of funds to the South. The Gold Control Bureau is closely monitoring this. However, according to relevant sources, most US dollar bonds have already been exchanged in Shanghai, and only a small number have flowed to Southern China for exchange, so the problem is not serious.</p>

<p>The cotton yarn market situation yesterday showed an inverted price presentation by customer firms, and appetite tended to be sluggish. Local colleagues also took a wait-and-see approach, so trading in the market was mostly sporadic. 42-count Blue Phoenix fine yarn saw good appetite among yarn merchants at the initial opening, and the market price jumped by 2 million to 195 million yuan. Some profit-taking occurred mid-way, and the price fell to 93 million yuan, similar to the closing price of the weekend.

Credit was unusually loose, speculative funds were active, and buying interest was observed. The price of Dragon Head fine cloth gradually rose to 4.39 million and 4.4 million yuan. Near noon, news of stable yarn prices led to some profit-taking, and the price fell back to close at 4.37 million yuan, a further increase of 120,000 yuan compared to the previous weekend. Various grades of fine cloth such as Five Blessings, Blue Chicken, and Rainbow Ball also continued to rise by 160,000 to 170,000 yuan.</p>

<p>Publishes Important Paper on Gravity</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, New York, 4th Dispatch] Renowned scientist Albert Einstein recently published a paper on gravity, which is a major event in the scientific community. Scientists believe that this paper is a significant advance in Einstein's efforts to determine the exact relationship between electricity and gravity. Einstein's article, which was published in the Reviews of Modern Physics, uses mathematics that is so profound that most physicists cannot fully understand it. Scientists generally recall that when Einstein published the theory of relativity, only a very small number of scholars could understand it. Atomic energy secrets were broken by the theory of relativity, and physics experts now believe that Einstein's new research may help to discover other secrets of the universe.</p>

<h3 id="e110">The Dongda University on the Brink of War <a href="#e110" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c110" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">110</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, I made a special trip to visit the National Northeastern University and returned with many thoughts. Seeing the devastation of Dongda, I am deeply concerned about education in the Northeast. My impression of Dongda is very different from last summer. Now, the Dongda campus is damaged, the equipment is empty, and although learning continues in form, something is fundamentally missing. This is a double tragedy caused by high prices and the intensity of the gunfire. Chinese education is facing the most serious juncture, and the problem of education in the Northeast is even more serious.</p>
<p>The environment in the Northeast is too harsh. Mr. Liu Shuxun, the president of Dongda, explains all the problems by pointing to the special environment, constantly shaking his head. Dongda's first lesson of the new semester is the "relocation issue." These days, the university is busy with make-up examinations for the previous semester. After the term exams, the "Strive for Relocation" movement will be the central task of the student union. Most professors keep their opinions hidden, but secretly support relocation. Where to relocate? The goal in everyone's mind is Beiping, but no one has explicitly stated it. President Liu has not expressed any opinion on the relocation, denying that it is happening, believing that relocating and not relocating are equally difficult. The president is acting in accordance with the Ministry of Education's orders, and I don't think the Ministry of Education has issued a formal relocation order.</p>
<p>The arguments for relocation are well-reasoned. They say: if the university does not relocate, it will be a declaration of bankruptcy for education in the Northeast! The slogans and cartoons demanding relocation add much-needed color to the desolate Dongda campus, with students posting them while campus workers wash them away. Theoretically, education requires a stable social environment with a stable political economy. Education in war and famine cannot recover well. The rise and fall of a university reflects the ebb and flow of national culture. Wouldn't it be a pity if it were destroyed by gunfire! The National Jilin Changbai Normal College is a case in point.</p>
<p>Dongda has five colleges—Liberal Arts, Science, Agriculture, Engineering, and Law and Commerce—with twenty-three departments, and a physical education specialty. There are more than 2,800 students, with about 2,200 registered this semester. Some students have gone to Beiping, some have been stranded as their hometowns have fallen, and another 85 students have been ordered to withdraw from school by the Xingyuan Command due to suspicion of being Communists. President Liu said, "I am very sorry, the actual number of students on campus is not very clear, and the work of moral education is not performing well. I cannot guarantee that there are no Communists in the school." As for the quality of these two thousand students, whether they are all talented individuals who can be cultivated is hard to say. Judging from the number of students in each college, there are fewer students in the Liberal Arts and Science colleges, which shows that language, history, art, and pure science are not valued. There are very few students in the Engineering college, indicating that the level of high school students in the Northeast is very low, because the Engineering college has stricter admission standards. The Law and Commerce college has the most students, nearly a thousand, accounting for one-half of the entire school. Is this to provide shelter and relief, or is it limited by job prospects after graduation?</p>
<p>Dongda is pitifully poor, with a monthly budget of 20 million yuan. Electricity costs take up 12 million yuan, and professors in the dormitories are still complaining about not having electricity. It is so poor that even exam paper is a problem. Everything is waiting to be revived. There is no chemical equipment in the teaching building, the library's walls are bare, garbage is piled all over the school, and buildings are thawing, leaking, and damaged without repair. It is indeed too difficult and too bitter to study in such an environment, no wonder the students are clamoring to go home. There is also an artillery regiment stationed on campus. A few days ago, when Shenyang was tense, the sound of artillery rumbled all day long. One humorous soldier in the artillery regiment said to the students, "Please don't be afraid, we are going to fire." It's both laughable and absurd!

<h3 id="e121">Conant on University Education <a href="#e121" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c121" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">121</a></h3>
<p>— Liren</p>
<p>Mr. Conant, the president of Harvard University in the United States, recently released a report on Harvard University. In this report, Mr. Conant has several passages on the general topic of university education, which are well worth our attention. The following is an introduction to these passages.</p>
<p>Mr. Conant believes that a university is a group of scholars working towards peaceful goals, striving for teaching and the advancement of knowledge. However, the current divided world, a state of armed truce, is particularly an unpleasant phenomenon for scholars. The evolution of the post-war world situation has undoubtedly cast a dark shadow on our higher education. Now, our universities, as in wartime, have many tasks that must be done for the government. Although we are very willing to do these jobs, some of them are not entirely peaceful, nor are they pleasant.</p>
<p>In such a world, Mr. Conant believes that university authorities and individuals have a clear responsibility, and that is to promote the exchange of world cultures. The exchange of professors and students between countries should be promoted and carried out with enthusiasm. Secondly, we should also strive to study the cultural types of other nations, so that we can understand the ideological backgrounds or assumptions of leaders of other countries as much as possible. In particular, we must understand the nations behind the so-called Iron Curtain. For example, if there are erroneous assumptions about the fundamental attitude of the Soviet Union, this is not only dangerous for ourselves, but also for peace. Therefore, in today's world, gaining a mature understanding of the culture and ideology of other nations is the most important and most difficult.</p>
<p>Mr. Conant believes that the existence of a university can be supported by or controlled by people, but a university is not an organ of the government, nor is it a private group. The professors in the university are not hired workers. The criteria for selecting professors are unique in some ways. This cannot be confused with the conditions for the government to appoint officials. There are many very learned scientists or philosophers who, because they have the ideal of universal brotherhood, may not be able to be government officials to negotiate treaties for the government, but from the point of view of their learning, they are very valuable to the university.</p>
<p>Mr. Conant believes that the activities of scholars in the university are based on free research as a necessary foundation. Without free research, you can have an institution of higher education, a vocational school, or a military academy, but you do not have a university. A university has free research as a necessary condition. I think we must agree on this point. Objective analysis of all aspects of our national life cannot be hindered in any way. Even in today's armed truce, we cannot sacrifice this principle. The nation has the right to demand that our professors in the university become fearless seekers of truth and prudent scholars on controversial topics, rather than propagandists. As long as the professors are faithful, sincere, and capable, we should always tolerate a wide range of different opinions.</p>
<p>Although the above paragraphs from the president of Harvard University are addressed to the United States, they are equally applicable when transferred to our country. The author sincerely hopes that our educational authorities will not ignore these paragraphs.</p>
<h3 id="e122">Lao Tzu's Dao Technique <a href="#e122" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c122" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">122</a></h3>
<p>— Yan Qun</p>
<p>Lao Tzu's "Dao" actually combines both substance and function. The Dao has both substance and function, just as an object has a head and tail, and just as a matter has a beginning and an end. The two complement each other, and neither is sufficient to be the Dao without the other. Substance is potentiality, and function is actuality. When potentiality reaches actuality, it is a natural and inevitable trend. Therefore, the Dao's progression from substance to function is also a natural and inevitable trend. What is the trend? Opposites complement each other, and opposites conquer and generate each other. The substance of the Dao is stillness, and its function is movement. Movement is the opposite of stillness. Therefore, the Dao's progression from substance to function follows the trend of opposites. Opposites have an opposite and a counter-opposite. The two alternate: what was previously the opposite turns into the counter-opposite, and what was previously the counter-opposite turns into the opposite. This is why stillness must come from movement, why movement must return to stillness, why the Dao progresses from substance to function and returns from function to substance, why all things have birth and death, formation and destruction, and why human affairs have order and chaos, prosperity and decline, returning in cycles, again and again. This is called Dao Technique. Dao Technique is nothing more than the path by which the substance of the Dao is activated, flows, and manifests in its function. Lao Tzu calls Dao Technique "trend," because it is natural and inevitable. What is this natural and inevitable thing? Opposites complement each other, opposites conquer and generate each other, that's all. Opposites complement each other, opposites conquer and generate each other, these are the ultimate principles of the universe's myriad transformations. Their scattered manifestations in the people and things are like birth and death, formation and destruction, fullness and emptiness, bending and straightening, order and chaos, prosperity and decline, disaster and fortune, likeness and illusion, beauty and ugliness, good and evil... their numbers are endless.</p>
<p>The trend of opposites exists within the substance of the Dao, so stillness must have movement, and the Dao must progress from substance to function. Stillness and movement, substance and function, only because they are opposites that generate each other, they are mutually dependent. Therefore, the substance of the Dao, which is without opposites, actually encompasses the principles of opposites. Those who seek the root of being have a difficult problem: the root of being must be absolute, that is certain, but the fact that all things are relative cannot be hidden. The root of being is unmoving and unchanging, that is also certain, but the fact that all things are changing and impermanent cannot be hidden. So how can the root of being, which is without opposites and unchanging, evolve into the myriad things that are opposite and changing? In terms of nominalism, absolute and relative, stillness and movement, constancy and change, are all mutually exclusive concepts. How can things that are mutually exclusive generate each other? For example, if we take the "Being" of Parmenides of Greece as the root of being, it is also absolute, still, and constant. Then the phenomenon of relative, moving, and changing universe cannot be explained. In the end, we must regard it as "Non-being," and the theory of the universe cannot be established. By forced justification, such as what his book calls "The way of opinion," we can also see that it must be justified. Another example is Empedocles's fire, air, water, and earth, and Anaxagoras's material species. Their root of being is also unmoving and unchanging. However, the birth and death, formation and destruction of the universe's myriad things are not sufficient to be caused by the unmoving and unchanging root of being alone. Therefore, they seek a separate cause of motion (Efficient or moving cause) outside of the root of being, such as Empedocles's two forces of "love" and "hate," and Anaxagoras's "mind" (Nous-mind). But seeking a cause of motion separately from the root of being means that the cause of motion is relative to the root of being. The universe's myriad things do not originate solely from the root of being, but must be aided by the cause of motion. Therefore, their root of being is not monistic. Only Lao Tzu's "Dao" actually encompasses the principle of opposites, so stillness can cause movement, and substance can reach function. Thus, the monistic root of being can be established. Why? Because the universe's myriad things that are changing and impermanent all derive their origin and have their destination here. Once the root of being, which combines both movement and stillness, substance and function, is established, then the universe's myriad things of birth and death, formation and destruction, are all the inevitable results of this root of being. This is why I say that such a universe must come from such a root of being, and that its theory of the root of being and its cosmology are consistent, and without the flaws of nominalism. But its reason for being like this also relies on its understanding of the trend of opposites conquering and generating each other, taking this trend as inherent in the substance, and taking this trend as the form. Then, all phenomena that conquer and oppose each other will inevitably lead to the effect of generating and complementing each other, and the myriad things will emerge. Therefore, this trend is actually the pivot of transition and evolution between the root of being and the universe. Understanding the effect of this trend is why Lao Tzu's theory of the root of being and his cosmology are consistent, like the two ends of a hammer.</p>
<p>If we analyze it, Lao Tzu's ability to understand the trend of opposites complementing each other depends on not being confined to human thinking when observing things and events, but directly exploring the natural principles of the universe. The so-called human thinking refers to the path followed by people in their thinking, the so-called Laws of Thought. The Laws of Thought are: (1) the Law of Identity, which states: what is, is; (2) the Law of Contradiction, which states: a thing cannot both be and not be; (3) the Law of Excluded Middle, which states: a thing must either be or not be. What the Laws of Thought clarify can be summarized in one sentence: the consistency of thought. When people think, they must base it on their point of view at that time and place, and have something to refer to: if something is referred to as A, then the meaning of that thing is limited to A, and cannot also be non-A, or hesitate between A and non-A. This shows that people's point of view is limited, what is referred to is true, and what is not referred to is untrue. True and untrue, from a human perspective, seem to be opposites that are mutually exclusive, but in discussing things in terms of things, they are both just things, so what opposite can be said? If something is referred to as a horse, then what is not referred to is a non-horse, a non-horse can be a cow or a sheep... the world is certainly full of things that are not horses. Calling it a non-horse simply means that the point of view is not there, and it is generalized with "non" in order to distinguish it from the point of view's location. The reason why a thing is a thing is because it has differences. The differences may be large or small, such as hot and cold, the difference is large; hot and warm, the difference is small. It is certainly not that cold is the opposite of hot, or that warm is not the opposite of hot. What is opposite of hot is only "non-hot." The so-called "non-hot" exists in people's concept, the label of language, in order to facilitate thinking. There is no thing that is "non-hot." Things are constantly changing and flowing. Hot dissipates and becomes warm, and it further dissipates and becomes cold. This is a natural and inevitable trend. Hot and cold are clearly two in concept, but in things they are the beginning and end of a single event. What is two in concept is opposite and mutually exclusive; what is the beginning and end in things gradually affects each other; accumulating concepts as thoughts and words, it is said that opposites affect each other, but in reality, things truly affect each other, but they are not opposites. Lao Tzu has probably seen this, so he uses human thinking to observe things and language to carry thoughts (matters of knowledge cannot be separated from the path of thinking and the tools of language, although they are obstructed by them, there is nothing to be done). He reveals the trend of mutual conquering and generating, mutual opposing and affecting in the midst of myriad transformations, in order to see that mutual conquering and opposing are not actually mutually conquering and opposing, but there is always one thing that runs through them. What is this one thing? The Dao is one. Moreover, Lao Tzu's seeing the mutual connection of opposites, because he is able to break the array of concepts and obtain the truth of things, taking what is opposite to people as not truly opposite in events and things, thus being able to affect each other: his still calling it "opposite" is to speak to ordinary people using the language of ordinary people, only hoping for mutual understanding.</p>
<p>Because Lao Tzu observes things and events with the trend of opposites complementing each other, his nominalism is different from ordinary nominalism. Ordinary nominalism takes the consistent Laws of Thought as its foundation, while Lao Tzu's nominalism takes the natural principle of opposites complementing each other as its ultimate goal. In ordinary nominalism, consistency lies in the point of view at one time and one place; in Lao Tzu's nominalism, consistency exists in the absolute substance of the Dao. A point of view is a matter possessed by people in their activities; the substance of the Dao is the pivot of the activities of transformation and flow. Therefore, Lao Tzu's nominalism is not the law of human beings seeking knowledge, but the path of transformation and flow; to express it in the terminology of Western philosophers, it is so-called metaphysical logic.</p>

<h3 id="e124">Rumor Psychology (II) <a href="#e124" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c124" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">124</a></h3>
<p>— Fang Zheng</p>
<p>The spread of rumors, psychologically speaking, is equivalent to serial reproduction. A model, in recollection, gradually loses its original appearance and tends toward a certain stereotype. Exaggeration, distortion, rationalization, and elaboration are the main trends in this change. This article will focus on these points.</p>
<p>The first is exaggeration. For example, in 1942, an American coal ship had an accident, but the rumor became "an American ship was torpedoed and sunk, with thousands of nurses on board all drowned." After Pearl Harbor was attacked, the United States did indeed lose many warships, but the rumor was that all American warships in the Pacific were destroyed. Often it is just a little thing, but the rumor always exaggerates it into a big deal. A rumor is a rumor because it is always an exaggeration.</p>
<p>However, exaggeration is not necessarily a manifestation of abnormal psychology, i.e., so-called exaggeration in the mind. It is a common phenomenon shared by general memory processes. For example, Gibson experimented with people's memory of pictures, with the following results:</p>
<p>In the first row, the first person had the impression of a "star" from the original picture, so the recollection became a "star" shape, and the point protruding from the right side of the original picture was exaggerated into a large angle. The second person's impression was a "flying bird," and the wings on both sides were lengthened and made more prominent. The third person's impression was an "arrowhead," and the point protruding from the right side was elongated into a trapezoid. The fourth person's impression was an "arrow," and the protruding point was stretched into an arrow shaft. The situation in the second row is similar. In the third and fourth rows, either the whole (all combined) or the part (more divergent) is exaggerated. It is worth noting that in the experimental situation, everyone is trying to recall the original picture, and their hearts are tending towards the truth. Even with the effort to be realistic, the exaggeration is still so great. Without this realistic mood, the exaggeration would naturally be even more unimaginable.</p>
<p>The result of exaggeration is distortion. But exaggeration still preserves some of the original appearance, while distortion completely changes the appearance. Here is an example of an experiment by Professor Bartlett of Cambridge University. This experiment is closer to the nature of rumors because he used "person-to-person" serial recall in the experiment. The original image is an ancient Egyptian letter Mnlak, the prototype of the letter M in Western alphabets. After the first person saw this letter, he drew it from memory. This is "Reproduction 1" in the figure. After the second person saw "Reproduction 1", he drew it from memory again, which is "Reproduction 2". It was passed down one by one, just like the spread of rumors. By the time it reached the tenth person, the result had completely become a cat, and the subsequent reproductions differed greatly from the original.</p>
<p>In some of the pictures above, there is a trend that is very noteworthy. That is, rigid, straight-line angular lines become very smooth, very natural lines. More natural, or more normalized, is the third trend we call: rationalization. The Egyptian ancient text M was originally the pictograph of an "owl." But this kind of writing is still a bit forced, and it looks a bit awkward. Therefore, the lines are becoming smoother and smoother, and the details are becoming more and more rationalized. The original line sloping down slowly became a tail, and it became lower and lower, and then it completely shrank to the bottom, and then it was exaggerated and dragged into a long tail. Even more interesting is that the "inverted person" character originally drawn in the middle of the head eventually evolved into a flower knot.</p>
<p>In this rationalization process, the fourth trend, elaboration, is also involved. More and more shaded, decorative lines are added, and finally, not only the whole body has fur, but also whiskers and flower knots. This is the most common "adding fuel to the fire" process in rumors. For example, rumors often have such a saying to gain credibility. At first, it may just be "I heard it from someone," then it becomes "someone very reliable said it," then it becomes "someone authoritative said it," then it becomes "a senior official of a certain headquarters said it," then it becomes "a certain commander-in-chief said it," and finally it may even become "a certain commander-in-chief personally said it to someone at a certain meeting." An empty "someone" finally evolved into not only a real person, but also a real place, time, and occasion. Therefore, I say that rumors have a certain trend, as if they must move towards a certain stereotype.</p>
<h3 id="e125">Anecdotes from the Academic World (16) <a href="#e125" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c125" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">125</a></h3>
<p>— Zhang Qiyun</p>
<p>Mr. Sun Zhongrong</p>
<p>Sun Yirang, styled Zhongrong, was born on August 19th (September 16th in the Gregorian calendar), 1848, in Rui'an County, a coastal area of Wenzhou, Zhejiang. Last year was the centenary of his birth. The mid-Qing Dynasty was the heyday of the textual research school, but politically, the sea frontiers were fraught with troubles, and the world was changing rapidly. His father, Qinxi Gong (Yiyan), was praised by Zhang Taiyan as a unique Confucian scholar in the late Qing Dynasty. Throughout his life, he devoted himself to promoting the Yongjia School in his hometown, which was one of the important branches of Zhejiang Eastern learning since the Song Dynasty. The main purpose of Zhejiang Eastern learning is to inherit the transmission of Chinese literature throughout history, integrate both classics and governance, take national affairs as its own responsibility, understand modern times and learn from the past, in order to apply them to the world. In the eleventh year of Tongzhi (1872), when Mr. Zhongrong was twenty-five years old, he wrote the preface to the "Collection of Idle Talks from the Genzhai Study" by Xue Jixuan of the Song Dynasty on behalf of Qinxi Gong (Collected Writings of Diligent Preparation, Volume 4), roughly stating that "Since the Qianlong and Jiaqing eras, great Confucians have emerged in large numbers, and those devoted to the study of human nature and classics each adhere to their own methods, without borrowing from each other. The division between Han and Song has been absolute. Yiyan once discussed the shortcomings of factionalism with scholars in the capital, and often believed that to integrate the strengths of Han and Song and bridge their divisions, there is nothing better than using the learning of Yongjia." This passage also describes Mr. Zhongrong's own academic goals. In that year, he began to work on his lifelong masterpiece, "Annotations and Commentary on the Rites of Zhou," which was completed in the twenty-fifth year of Guangxu (1899), when Mr. was fifty-two years old, with a total of eighty-six volumes. Two years later, he wrote "Essentials of the Rites of Zhou" in two volumes. Mr. died on May 22nd in the thirty-fourth year of Guangxu (1908) at the age of sixty-one. This year marks the fortieth anniversary of his death.</p>
<p>The Rites of Zhou, originally called the Zhou Guan, is the most complete classic on the Zhou Dynasty's political system. The Rites of Zhou consists of six sections, each beginning with the words "Establishing the Nation." This is a blueprint for nation-building from two thousand years ago. The entire book is grand in scope and profound in thought, containing tens of thousands of words, and is unparalleled in the world. It is the work of a first-class intellect from the pre-Qin period, based on historical facts and infused with ideals. There are different opinions on the date of its composition, but we can try to verify it through geography. The book's description of the nine provinces of the world includes Youzhou in the northeast, with the Wulv Mountain near present-day Jin County, Liaoning, as its main feature. This shows that its composition was likely after the power of the Yan State reached beyond the customs. According to the reign of King Zhao of Yan (311-279 BC), Qin Kai was a general who defeated the Donghu, expanded the territory by over a thousand miles, and established five commanderies (Shanggu, Yuyang, Youbeiping, Liaoxi, and Liaodong), building the Great Wall to defend against the Hu. The Yan State expanded its territory at the beginning of the third century BC, so the writing of the geography could not have been earlier than this. King Wuling of Zhao's adoption of the Hu clothing and mounted archery was around the end of the fourth century BC. The Rites of Zhou still describes chariot warfare, so its era should not have been later than that. Based on this inference, the author of the Rites of Zhou was likely a figure from the late Warring States period, in the third century BC, contemporary with Xun Zi, and about a century later than the Greek philosopher Plato, who wrote "The Republic."</p>
<p>Mr. Zhongrong said in his preface that the study of the Rites of Zhou should be based on "ancient meanings and ancient systems, thoroughly explained and verified." Textual research is only a tool for learning. He once said, "Scholars who inherit learning only regard the Zhou classics and Han commentaries as a treasure trove of textual research. How can they not become straw dogs that have already been discarded?" (Preface to Annotations and Commentary on the Rites of Zhou). He divided ancient meanings and ancient systems into two. Ancient systems are the traces of governance, subject to the limitations of time and space, and may not be applicable to later generations. Ancient meanings are the principles of governance, and "the most refined aspects of governance must be consistent with the public principles of all things" (Preface to Essentials of the Rites of Zhou). This is a universal principle that can be applied anywhere. The conclusion of the Annotations and Commentary on the Rites of Zhou contains the following passage:</p>
<p>"If there are gentlemen in the world who can understand the reasons for heaven and humanity, and understand the origins of order and chaos, and can take this classic and thoroughly study its theories, using ancient meanings and ancient systems to understand the grand intentions and subtle purposes of politics and education, organizing and explaining them, writing a special book to elaborate and expand upon them, to await later sages, and perhaps use this humble book as a guide and pioneer, then this is what I privately hope for but cannot meet."</p>
<p>Mr. Zhongrong was very modest, saying that he "only introduced the beginnings and dared not let his theories run wild." In fact, his political ideas were already revealed everywhere in the annotations of the Annotations and Commentary on the Rites of Zhou. Later, the book Essentials of the Rites of Zhou, with a total of forty-eight chapters including diagrams and maps, was developed more fully.</p>
<p>The Annotations and Commentary on the Rites of Zhou was started in the late Tongzhi period, after the Sino-French War. Mr. said himself that "he was concerned about the state of the world and sighed while holding the scroll." The entire book was completed in the year of the Wuxu Reform. The discussion of reform began in the year of defeat to Japan in the Sino-Japanese War, reached its peak in the Wuxu year, but was thwarted by the resistance of the old forces. At that time, the distinction between Western and Chinese, new and old, was confusing and bewildering. Mr. Zhongrong believed that the cause of wealth and power was rooted in politics and education, "to discuss wealth and power without politics and education is like cutting off the rivers and streams to reach the sea." The Rites of Zhou is a collection of the essence of ancient political systems, and its links to the causes of wealth and power of the Western nations in modern times are connected. Mr. Zhongrong examined the past to discuss governance, distinguishing between changeable traces and unchanging principles, and strongly argued that there was no difference in the paths of China and the West, new and old, "so that stubborn scholars would reflect on their own and have nothing to say." In particular, after writing Annotations and Commentary on the Rites of Zhou, he wrote Essentials of the Rites of Zhou to supplement it. In the late Qing Dynasty, Mr. made a great contribution to the transformation of thought from old to new. Mr. was a powerful torchbearer for the establishment of the Republic of China. (According to Zhang Taiyan's letter to Mr. Zhongrong, Mr. signed the preface with "Yihai, two hundred and thirty-eight years after Xinchou". Xinchou refers to the year of Shunzhi 18, when Emperor Yongli was captured. Also, Mr.'s inscription on Tinglin's Collection of Poems contains two quatrains: "Closing the book in the wind, I suddenly sigh, the country has been lost for three hundred years", which can be said to be an expression of his feelings). Now, forty years have passed since Mr.'s death, and the resistance of the conservatives is no longer a concern. Another group of people often ignores our country's historical traditions, loses national self-confidence, belittles Chinese culture, and advocates Westernization, like building pavilions on sand, and even develops into a centrifugal force, plunging the country into division, which may be a greater obstacle to the new policy than the conservatives of that year. Now that the constitutional government has begun, the crystallization of Mr. Zhongrong's lifelong research is worth our careful understanding. The author has written an article on Sun Yirang's political thought, divided into (1) statistical cartography, (2) grassroots organization, (3) national livelihood, (4) educational purpose, which is briefly explained in the Zhejiang Journal, and will not be repeated here.</p>

<h3 id="e126">On Hunger Strikes <a href="#e126" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c126" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">126</a></h3>
<p>— Jing Wen</p>
<p>Mahatma Gandhi, the Indian saint who used hunger strikes as a last resort, is dead, but the trend of hunger strikes has not ended with Gandhi.</p>
<p>Food is the paramount necessity of the people. Human life cannot be separated from the need for food. An infant knows to ask for milk as soon as it is born. A death row prisoner still has the appetite to drink large bowls of wine and eat large chunks of meat before going to the execution ground. A large part of the world's cultural achievements are probably related to the need for food. And all social problems, in the final analysis, are nothing more than the problem of eating. Even the noble poet Tao Yuanming once bent his waist for five pecks of rice.</p>
<p>Since the issue of eating is so important, it is somewhat inconceivable that many people are still willing to use hunger strikes as a last resort to achieve their goals. Perhaps, as religious people say, people do not live by bread alone. Besides the basic desire for food, there are many more important spiritual needs. For example, "losing one's chastity is a big matter, starving to death is a small matter" expresses that in the balance between bread and integrity, one should weigh their importance. Boyi and Shuqi, who were ashamed to eat the Zhou Dynasty's millet and were willing to starve to death on Shouyang Mountain, are an example.</p>
<p>However, a hunger strike is ultimately a last resort. Those who take this measure must understand that the spiritual requirements they uphold are indeed worth using a hunger strike as a means of protest, and they must also be able to grasp the sympathy of the masses. Because a hunger strike is an act of sacrifice, and sacrifice should have value. The reason for the sacrifice must be based on the interests of the public. Only in this way can one's own hunger strike sacrifice be exchanged for the strength of the masses.</p>
<p>Gandhi's repeated hunger strikes met these conditions. Because Gandhi demanded the liberation of India, which was the demand of every Indian. His anti-violence and non-resistance, given the situation in India at the time, could also win the sympathy of the world. Therefore, Gandhi's hunger strike was a true sacrifice with a noble cause. Although Gandhi ultimately died not from a hunger strike but at the hands of thugs, his firm will expressed by repeatedly using hunger strikes as a last resort finally led to India's independence today.</p>
<p>But while it is also a hunger strike, in some situations it cannot win the sympathy of most people. For example, some men and women often resort to hunger strikes due to family disputes. Although there are also some aspects worthy of pity, once everyone calms down, they will find that things do not need to be done so seriously, and there are many other solutions besides hunger strikes.</p>
<p>The most unsympathetic hunger strike is to use hunger strikes as a means of coercion to achieve selfish goals. In the past, women in old-fashioned families liked to use crying, starving, and hanging as a means of coercion against their husbands. However, old-fashioned women who were forced to do this still had something to be pitied, because at that time, society did not allow the rebellious spirit of women like "Nora". In order to win the love of their husbands, women sometimes had to resort to this last resort.</p>
<p>However, for those who are not in a situation like Gandhi, hunger strikes are ultimately a bad strategy. Unless it is absolutely necessary, it is best to eat more. Because if one is shouting for a hunger strike while eating fruit or drinking milk, it is difficult to gain sympathy after all.</p>
<p>I believe that as society progresses, there will be fewer and fewer phenomena of using hunger strikes as a tool of resistance. For example, in European and American societies, one rarely sees people on hunger strikes, unless it is a fast day. Workers there demand higher wages and strive to improve their treatment, mostly using positive and active methods, and there are very few "starving workers" or hunger strikes. Although it also takes courage to actually do a hunger strike (like Gandhi), it is ultimately a passive behavior. Most problems in the world can be solved by arguing on the basis of reason. As the saying goes, if you have a reason, you can fight even the highest authority. As long as the reason is just and bright, people's sympathy will always stand on your side. Even if you don't win this time, there will be plenty of opportunities in the future. To be honest, there are not many people in the world who can gain sympathy by going on a hunger strike. As far as I can see, there is only Gandhi.</p>
<h3 id="e127">Foreign Liquor and Shaoxing Wine <a href="#e127" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c127" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">127</a></h3>
<p>— Ying Zhi</p>
<p>It is a great thing to gather three or five old friends in a small room on a dreary, rainy day, to be slightly tipsy and have a good time. However, the price of wine is getting higher and higher, and I am afraid that poor people cannot afford it. It is better to read what others have written about wine. There are many kinds of wine. Roughly, they can be divided into two major categories: distilled liquor and Shaoxing wine. The Qing people discussed their merits, such as Xu Chenglie's "Notes from the Listening Rain Pavilion," which says: "The types of wine are difficult to enumerate, but distilled liquor is the most potent. Drinking too much can often lead to burning hair and rotting intestines, which is frightening. When I was in Guangdong in the past, I drank foreign liquor, which was amber in color and very mellow in the mouth. But in the stomach, it felt like being branded by fire, unbearably hot. Even those with a large capacity dare not finish one 'he'. Later, I was a guest in Wuyuan, Guangxi, which has always been known for its good distilled liquor, with categories such as single-distilled, double-distilled, triple-distilled, and quadruple-distilled. Single-distilled is similar to our local wheat liquor but more mellow. Double-distilled is more potent, and triple-distilled is undrinkable. I tried to drink a cup, and it tasted fragrant and spicy, like a fuse running straight from the throat to the 'dantian' (lower abdomen). I felt hot all over my body and was drunk for half a day before I woke up. The color of quadruple-distilled is slightly green, and I dare not taste it. Smelling its aroma is enough to get drunk. I heard that it does not use rice or flour, but is purely distilled from double-distilled liquor, so it is so fragrant and potent."</p>
<p>It also says: "Yellow wine is best from Jun, while distilled liquor values lightness the most. Each jar of single-distilled is ten 'jin' (about 5 kg), while double-distilled weighs only eight 'jin', and quadruple-distilled is only five or six 'jin'. I have verified this and there is no error. The price of double-distilled is double that of single-distilled, triple-distilled is three times that of single-distilled, and quadruple-distilled is double that of double-distilled. The seller always uses the value of single-distilled as the standard. People say that single-distilled contains 'Hegemon's Whip' (a medicinal herb; its root is neither wood nor vine, it grows only one node each year, like a child's arm, green in color, with four sharp thorns and no branches or leaves, and white oil spurts out when its skin is broken, and people plant it in their gardens for hedges, some growing to seven or eight 'chi' [about 2.3-2.7 meters]), and those who indulge in it often suffer from madness in their legs. Double-distilled and above do not contain it, but this cannot be known for sure. When I was in Lingnan, I only liked Shaoxing yellow wine, and I dared not drink distilled liquor often." Liang Zhangju's "Random Talks While Wandering" also says of distilled liquor: "The name of distilled liquor cannot be found in ancient times. It first appears in Bai Juyi's poem 'Distilled liquor is first opened, amber in color,' which means it was red, not like today's white liquor. The Yuan people called it 'sweat wine,' and Li Zhongbiao called it 'Araqi liquor,' writing in a poem: 'It took many years to obtain the method of sweat wine, one is worth ten in taste and rich.' This is the true distilled liquor of today. Today, all grain-producing areas have distilled liquor, and that brewed from sorghum is the most authentic. The persimmon liquor, Lu liquor, and Fen liquor of the North are all made from sorghum, but the taste of the water is different, and the strength of the liquor also varies accordingly. I once heard a foreign barbarian say: 'China has a supreme treasure, but people do not know how to consume it,' referring to sorghum distilled liquor. They also taught people how to consume it, saying that between midnight and the 'hai' hour (9-11 pm) every night, one should wake up from a hazy sleep and consume a cup of this liquor, accompanied by a light dish. After drinking, one should fall back asleep, which is very beneficial." Zhangju also said to himself: "As an official with a busy life, I may not be able to go to bed between the 'hai' and 'zi' hours (11 pm-1 am), and it is also difficult to find the right person to serve me at night," so he happened to have a "Shandong subordinate magistrate" who anticipated his wishes and taught him a method of consuming it in the middle of the night, without the need for manpower, and comfortable and free, "Every cold night, consuming this is especially enjoyable," so he "practiced it as prescribed from Shandong to this day for nearly twenty years." Also, his "Random Talks While Wandering," "Trivial Notes from Returning to the Countryside," and other books record many medicinal wine recipes, saying that Tusu wine is also medicinal wine, showing that this old bureaucrat, immersed in food and medicine, was very dull. However, he also knew Shaoxing wine, as he says in "Random Talks": "Today, Shaoxing wine is popular throughout the country and can be called the orthodox wine, but there are also those who make unwarranted criticisms. They have not tasted the best of Shaoxing wine. People often laugh that Shaoxing wine is just ordinary wine, but it is sold all over the world, even reaching the remote regions of Xinjiang. Frankly speaking...in terms of the popularity of wine, no other wine is sufficient to compete, because the water between Shanyin and Kuaiji is most suitable for wine, and it cannot be good if it is moved to another place. Therefore, all other prefectures have Shaoxing people who brew it according to the method, but since the water is different, the taste is far inferior; even in Shaoxing itself, good wine is not easy to obtain, but the further it is sold, the better it is, because it cannot travel far unless it is the best. I have tasted wine in Gansu, Longxi, and Guilin, and the wine I obtained was excellent, and it was even better outside Jiayuguan. If it is near the Central Plains, it cannot be drunk unless it has been stored for several years. The best is called 'Daughter Wine'. It is said that rich families brew several jars as soon as they have a daughter, and they are not opened until the daughter gets married. So it is at least ten years old. The jars are usually painted with colorful paintings and called 'Flower Carvings.' Recently, there have been many forgeries, even using flower cans to hold ordinary wine to deceive people. When identifying wine, the lighter the jar, the better, because the more aged the wine, the more it shrinks. Some jars shrink to half their original size. If you knock on the bottom of the jar with a cone, the sound of a real one is clear, while the sound of a fake or spoiled one is not clear. There are even those who poke the jar with a small cone, pour out the good wine, and then fill it with water. Looking at the outside, it is still a flower carving, but it is worth nothing. When storing wine, you must choose a flat place and line it with wooden planks. If it is on unstable ground and shaken repeatedly, it will spoil in a month. Also, avoid living in a damp place, as the taste of the wine will easily change over time. When heating wine, you must use hot water to warm it. Silver bottles are the best for storing wine, followed by porcelain bottles, and tin bottles are the worst. Wine is best when it is first warmed. Reheating it reduces the flavor. If you need to serve guests quickly, warming it over a fire will improve the flavor, but it will be hotter, which is not suitable for the mouth and body." Other anecdotes about wine tasting and miscellaneous stories are recorded in Qing Dynasty notebooks such as "Notes from the Thatched Hall of Microscopic Views," "Suiyuan Food List," "Pure Talks from Returning Home," "Fragrant Records of Orchids and Irises"...and there are many historical materials about wine.</p>

<p>— Mao Yi</p>
<p>Lincoln was a president who came from humble beginnings. He was born in a log cabin. However, Lincoln was not the only American president born in a log cabin. Jackson, Tyler, Fillmore, Buchanan, and Garfield were all born in log cabins. President Harrison also said in his campaign propaganda that he was born in a log cabin, but in fact, he was born in a beautiful mansion in Virginia.</p>
<p>It is generally believed that Washington was the richest president of the United States, but in fact, Hoover was the richest president. He still has a long-term room in the most luxurious Waldorf Hotel in New York. Although Lincoln was poor, he was frugal. After his death, he left an estate of $110,974. Washington served two terms as president and did not receive any salary. President Van Buren received his entire salary at once when his term expired. Presidents Jefferson and Grant had the most desolate lives and died penniless.</p>
<p>President Tyler died of heatstroke, and President Harrison died of a cold. However, both died in the White House, which can be said to have died in their proper places. Harrison caught a cold when he reviewed the troops at the inauguration ceremony without wearing a hat or coat and riding on horseback. Tyler laid the cornerstone of the Washington Monument in the hot sun, drank some cold milk, and ate a bowl of fresh berries. The heat was oppressive, and he was careless with his diet, so he became ill after returning to the White House.</p>
<h3 id="e129">A Fragmented Description of Spring Feelings <a href="#e129" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c129" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">129</a></h3>
<p>— Liu Yun</p>
<p>In March, in the south of the Yangtze River, the orioles are flying and the grass is sprouting. Confined to the city, working laboriously at my desk, I have no chance to enjoy an outing in the countryside, and I feel very uneasy. The beautiful spring days are wasted idly, and my spirit is greatly damaged. I happened to read Weng's "Daily Lessons in the Flowers" from West Lake, which says:</p>
<p>"Get up in the morning and order osmanthus soup, instruct the servant to sweep the winding paths through the flowers, read the flower calendar, protect the moss on the steps, take the rose dew from the courtyard in the morning, burn the yu rui incense, and read the red and green characters; at noon, pick bamboo shoots and ferns, serve sesame seeds, and draw spring water to taste new tea; in the afternoon, ride a gentle horse, holding a pair of scissors as a whip, and carry a flagon of wine and two oranges, go to listen to the orioles; sit in front of the willow wind at dusk, tear five-colored paper, and freely chant poems; return along the path in the evening, instruct the gardener to take care of the flowers, feed the cranes, and raise the fish."</p>
<p>Reading this, my heart feels open and happy, and I yearn for it endlessly. The daily lessons in the flowers are nothing less than the life of an immortal. However, this is truly the leisure of a hermit in a prosperous age, a refined matter of peace. A thought suddenly returns, adding a bit of melancholy for the past.</p>
<h3 id="e130">Tolstoy and Turgenev's Duel <a href="#e130" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c130" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">130</a></h3>
<p>— Eastern</p>
<p>Tolstoy was ten years younger than Turgenev, but after his magnum opus "War and Peace" was published, his literary fame far surpassed Turgenev's, so disagreements often arose between them. Of course, the cause of these disagreements between the two great writers stemmed from their different innate temperaments, not from jealousy.</p>
<p>Once, they both visited a friend together. During the gathering, they discussed the education of Turgenev's adopted daughter. Turgenev tried his best to praise the virtue and excellent educational methods of his English governess, and said, "She also advised my daughter to mend clothes for the poor with her own hands."</p>
<p>But Tolstoy believed that being educated by foreigners to the point of almost forgetting one's own language was detestable. He said, "I think it is dishonest for a girl to dress herself up beautifully while holding ragged clothes in her hands; this behavior is like a farce on stage."</p>
<p>"So, do you think my way of educating my daughter is bad?" Turgenev said angrily.</p>
<p>"That statement is consistent with your words and actions," Tolstoy replied calmly.</p>
<p>"If you say that again, I'll smash your head!" Turgenev said in a rage, and then ran away quickly, and the banquet ended unhappily.</p>
<p>On the way back, Tolstoy wrote a letter to Turgenev asking him to apologize. The delay in the reply made Tolstoy even angrier, so he sent a duel challenge to Turgenev, but Turgenev's reply was not received until later.</p>
<p>This furious duel ultimately did not materialize due to the delay in delivering the letters. This incident occurred in 1861. In less than four months, Tolstoy regretted this unpleasant matter. At this time, due to Turgenev's residence in Paris, the two great writers did not reconcile and become as good as before until 1878.</p>

<p>— Chen Shenyan</p>
<p>Chapter Fourteen: Roaming on the Sea (29)</p>
<p>Zhu Zhai looked at this Han Yu, who was only in her twenties. Her face was very delicate, her figure slender. She wore a dark blue woolen robe, white silk stockings, and black leather shoes. She wore no makeup on her face, and her manner was refined and generous. Zhu Zhai quickly bowed to her. Feng Sheng pointed to her from the side and said, "Han Yu, tell me, do I have a job now?" Han Yu smiled and said, "You can say it's a job, or you can say you're helping me." Zhu Zhai said, "What kind of business is Miss Han running?" Han Yu said, "I have joined with several comrades to organize a small home industry, specializing in the manufacture of soap, toothpaste, face cream, hair oil, etc. In addition, we also make bed sheets, pillows, and children's clothing for home use. All the workers in our factory are female workers, and I have asked Feng Sheng to help me." Zhu Zhai said, "Manufacturing toothpaste, soap, etc. are all specialized chemistry, how can she do it?" Han Yu said, "I asked Feng Sheng to help me with bookkeeping and supervising the general workers, not to make anything." Feng Sheng said, "Did you hear that? I didn't lie to you, did I?" Zhu Zhai sat in the chair, pondered for a while, and said, "Can she handle it?" Han Yu said, "Why not? Feng Sheng is a great help to me. I feel that in this society, both men and women should have careers and work hard for their future. Mr. Xu is starting a business outside, and Feng Sheng is working at home, wouldn't that be perfect?" Zhu Zhai saw their situation and knew that all his plans had failed again, and he sat on the chair without saying a word. Han Yu said, "I also know a little about your past, and I judge from a third-party perspective that you two should be more stimulated, and your careers will definitely succeed in the future. Because life is too ordinary, everything will not be pursued with effort. There must be considerable stimulation, a burst of energy, no matter how difficult the future is, you will go forward bravely. You two are now in this environment, and I hope you grit your teeth and endure the pain, and you will definitely achieve something in the future. If you are reluctant and compromise now, after a while, you will definitely have opinions again. When things break down again, the relationship will get worse and worse, and even the courage to go forward bravely and start a business will be lost. At that time, all hope will be gone." Feng Sheng said, "I extremely agree with Han Yu's view. Zhu Zhai, you don't have to be disappointed. This is our opportunity, and you shouldn't miss it."</p>
