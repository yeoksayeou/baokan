<h3>中美英將採一致行動　同時承認大韓民國　共同努力繁榮安定東方</h3>
<p>〔本報南京三日電〕據悉：中·美·英三國將採」致行動，同時承認新近依憲政軌道建立之大韓民國，此舉自韓國在聯合國監視下舉行大選以後，三國即曾交換意見，今韓國會已同意李承晚總統提名之林範　將軍出任首任內閣總理，首任內閣亦將於短期內組成，三國之正式承認當不在遠，被主要盟國承認後之韓國，將可自美軍手中接收政權，重亨其已喪失五十餘年之獨立自主。按自一九四五年十二月莫斯科會議，三外長會議決定四國託管韓國五年後，韓國人民及革命領袖咸表反對，然蹉跎經年，各國並未獲得進一步之協議，而韓國局勢在美·蘇軍觀界佔領下日趨惡劣，迨去年四月我國王外長曾函馬歇爾，主張韓國應早獨立，並建議於佔領國無法成立協議，中·美·英·蘇應迅速全面協商，旋韓國問題提出於聯合國，幾經周折，聯合國委員會不顧蘇聯之反對，協助民主韓國之建立，乃有今日之形勢，韓國爲我兄弟之邦，在其爭取獨立運動中，我國始終予以支持，今終底於成，實不僅韓國人民意志之實現，亦我國全民夙願之得償，京中朝野人士均信，中·韓兩國將永久和平相處，共同解決本身問題，為東方之繁榮安定携手努力。</p>

<h3>國民黨將怎樣革新？</h3>
<p>國民黨的革新運動，醖　甚久，現在已漸由呼號宜傳而進入具體化的階段了。國民黨黨務座談會昨天已在京關幕，聞將有兩天會議，討論黨務改進方案；除了留京的中央執監委員，國民黨確的立委監委而外，各部會首長之為國民黨黨員者，也一律參加討論，誠可謂國民黨的一大盛會。雖然這祇是一個座談會，還未見得有決定性的作用；但如果有所決議，可能即爲將來中央全會討論的根據。當此國家存亡革命成敗的緊要關頭，國民黨舉行黨務的自我檢討，以求其改進，不論對於國民黨本身，或對於我國家民族的影響，都是一種可喜的現象。但是，最要的關　，須知不在乎討論而在乎實行，不在乎祇在口舌上爭辯，相互實厲，而在乎每一方面，每一委員澈底的自我反省，用行動來首先革新他們自己，以求得國人的信任。</p>
<p>中國國民黨原非普通的政黨可比。論歷史，它是一個具有五十多年革命史實的政黨，實際掌握政權已達二十年之久。革命前半期，它領導國人革命，推翻滿淸，創立民國；打倒軍閥，統一全國。抗戰軍典，國民黨又領導全國軍民，艱苦抗戰，擊敗暴日，廢除一切不平等條約，一躍而為戰後世界五强之一。平心而論，國民黨對於國家，有無上的功勛，有如此的歷史，它在人民心底，應該是永遠不能磨滅的，人民也永遠會懷念它的。論主義，輪政綱，國民黨信奉國父遺教，實行三民主義，不僅為中國目前所需要，而且也為中國將來所需要。凡是警良純正的國民，即使沒有加入國民黨，也大都信仰三民主議，認為最適合於國情，對於國民黨仍抱着希望，而憧　着一個三民主談新中國的出現。但是，在今天，爲什麼社會上又似乎蔓延着一片責難國民黨的聲浪，彷彿國民黨對國家民族負了什麼重大的罪擊一樣呢？誠然，一個政黨執政過久，人民難免對它厭倦，正如英國戰後保守黨的處境，然而，假使國民黨自己仍然是一個生氣蓬勃，活力堅强，忠於主義，百折不變，自信心旺盛的政黨，那麼以數百萬一心一德的黨員，憑藉數十年革命奮鬥的經驗，應付此艱難的偉大時代，決不致束手無策，好像待宰的羔羊一般的。</p>
<p>老實說罷，國人對於國民黨現在似乎希望减低，國民黨的光榮歷史目前似乎黯淡無光，在國民黨員自然覺得無限的沈痛與惋惜，在國人亦何嘗不感覺是國家的損失？然而，一個光榮的革命政黨搞到如此地步，實在是要由國民黨深切反省自己負責的。而今國民黨舉行黨務座談會，若還不能檢討出國民黨的病根，對症下藥，使國民黨獲得新生，則今日的國民黨黨員固將無以負荷國家之重，而且也將愧對國父在天之靈！</p>
<p>究覽國民黨的　根何在？曰：老大而巳矣！去老大之病惟一「新」字。「周　舊邦，其命維新」；「茍日新，日日新，又日新」，這都是教導我們努力求新的格言。然則國民黨將怎樣革新呢？這確不是一個單純的問題，見仁見智，各有不同。昨日會議中，聞有人主張另組「獨立共產黨」，迢就未免「新」得出奇了！國民黨如果這樣去革新，好似要和中國共產黨爭共產主義的正統一樣，那不是天大笑話是什麼？前據報裁：黨中首畏也曾一再舉行會議，商談革新計劃，提出的問題有三：（一）黨部機構之簡化或改組；（二）黨務組織的一元化或二元化；（三）黨部體系的自下而上減自上而下。實則由我們看來，革新黨務如果仍照這樣去檢討，結果恐等於零！這些僅是在形式上鬧把戲，無救於國民黨的沉疴。我們站在愛護國民黨的立塲，也願提供兩點意見，是否逆耳，也顧不得了。</p>
<p>第一，國民黨是一個有機體，必須懂得「新陳代謝」的作用，保持「日新又新」的精神。國民黨因爲有五十年的革命歷史，執政了二十多年，如今不僅組織龐大，黨員衆多，好似已經成了「全民的政黨」，而且在這二十年中，不知先先後後混進了幾許腐敗惡劣的份子，一切一切假借「黨」之名義以行，而實則「黨」未嘗能有所約束。加以缺少「新陳代謝」的有機作用，好傑成了一潭死水，納垢藏汚，以致薰蕕同器，十年有臭，人民眼中就祗看見一部份腐化惡化的黨員，而遺忘了國民黨中多年來無數流血犧牲的成仁先烈與許多含辛茹苦特立屬行的奮鬥志士。同時一個成功的黨，主持者又往往持盈保泰，只知數衍現狀，拿不出一新耳目的作風，更下不了壯士斷腕的決心，於是任令腐敗頹喪的空氣，逐漸漸漫，而曾不一加挽救。再加以黨內則派系分拔，黨外則挑撥離問，而狡黠者流，更挾其聽明才智，從橫　關於其間。今後革新黨務，若還不能痛切「罪己」，澈底澄淸，則腐敗渣滓，依然存留，黨內遠賢，依然埋沒，新陳無由代謝，朝氣何能復生？檢討一年半裁，也必亳無兩處！</p>
<p>第二，國民黨旣是一個革命的政黨，凡是國民黨黨員，都該為了革命抱負而來，而革命志士的第一義諦，就是自我犧牲！沒有這種自我犧牲的革命精神者，今後當不為國民黨所容留。須知革命精神，並不是一些只是「自命前進恣意批評」的人所表現的精神，而是埋頭苦幹不求聞達的自我犧牲精神。當年辛亥革命和黃花崗之役，革命前輩的情神，才是國民黨今後醫洽病根的良藥。過去國民黨的一部光榮歷史，字字都是革命先烈用血來寫成的！現在國民黨正遭到空前的難關，國民黨黨員應該更有偉大的精神為黨犧牲為國犧牲的抱負，而不當祇在黨內高聲駡人，絕不自買，暗中爭權，毫不退讓，否則救黨之願未必得償，而黨與國或特同歸於盡！今日國民黨的大病，不在黨員太多，而在具有革命精神的黨員太少。不在黨員不談革命，而在黨員祗有高談革命而忘記了各人先自革心！我們認為凡是自私自利之徒，不論他們是欲以國民黨爲進身　　的，或藉國民黨而沽名釣譽的，國民黨應毅然決然一律不再客評他們留在黨內，成為國民黨繼續腐敗的發酵劑！惟有如此，國民黨才可自拔，國民黨的當局也才可眞正與民更始。</p>

<h3>三專使會見史達林　各電本國政府提出報告　談話內容暫時未能披露</h3>
<p>〔合衆社莫斯科三日電〕迅速打破德國問題僵局，三日巳團露可能之徵兆。美英法三國使節二日晚九時與史達林總理在克里姆林宮作二小時談話後，辭出時而露笑容。莫斯科觀察家認為與史達林或莫洛托夫之商談必將繼續。莫洛托夫亦出席二日晚之歷史性會議。會後三使簡齊赴美大使館，由英駐蘇公使哈里遜及美駐蘇代辦柯勒參加，聯合檢討此次會談之結果。三國代表旋將會談詳情分別報告各該國政府，彼等拒向報界透露會議情形。下次會談當視彼等對此次會談之反響，與各該國政府之訓令如何而定。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社倫敦三日電〕英外部今晨證實該部業已收到英代表羅伯茲之報告，謂渠昨夜曾與史達林舉行會談。據英外部方面消息，三强代表分別由史達林接見，第一人為美駐蘇大使史密斯，第二名為英特使羅伯茲，最後為法大使夏台岳。英外部發言人對此拒絕評論，僅稱英外部對所接得之莫斯科方面報告已在審查中。</p>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓三日電〕國務院三日已接獲美駐蘇大使史密斯關於西方使節會見史達林之報告。國務院新聞組員麥克杜莫德稱，〔吾人已接獲史密斯大使之報告」。詢以詳盡，麥氏答稱，「吾人所能言者僅此而巳，其內容實無可奉告」。報告巳由國務卿馬歇爾副國務卿洛維特及其他官員立即研究，至於詳情何時發表，此間猶無跡象。</p>
<p>〔中央社柏林三日電〕據消息靈通之蘇聯人士稱，西方國家若堅決貫澈成立西德政府之計劃，則蘇聯當局決不退後一步。關於史達林與西方國家駐蘇使節之兩小時會談事，此蘇聯人士稱，在目前情形下，四國惟一可能之議題，或為西方國家和平撤出柏林駐軍問題。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社倫教二日電〕當局對於西方三國專使在莫斯科謁見史達林一事，默不置許。惟英國政治家預料今日之會議如果獲有成果，則可開啟四强外長會議重行開會之途徑，甚至在下一階段，可能由美總統杜魯門。英首相艾德禮，法總理馬利會晤史達林親自折衝。此一會議之議程必踰越柏林問題之範圍，或將處理多月以來蘇聯與西方三强意見相左之諸問題。除半官方面作此預料外，英美法三國政府所致其莫斯科專使之具體訓令，迄今毫未有所洩漏。三國政府深恐危害談判之結果，故守口如瓶。</p>
<h3>柏林警政告分裂　蘇區警察局長非法捕人</h3>
<p>〔合衆社柏林三日電〕東西之爭，又在柏林爆發，柏林警察已告分裂。西方佔區之警長史都姆三日指控蘇區警長馬克格拉夫捕去非共產警官四人，包括女警察一人。新受市政府任命之史都姆特電話曾在莫斯科受訓之馬氏，要求將四人立即释放。按為氏被市政府免職後，拒不移交，遂形成柏林警界之分裂。史氏之總部移設美區，當四警員奉派赴舊本部提取檔案時，被馬氏下令逮捕。馬氏則自稱為柏林唯一合法警察機關，並在蘇聯系報紙大登廣告，說明德人往來西德及柏林間之辦法。</p>
<h3>蘇控制柏林　計劃着着進行</h3>
<p>〔合衆社柏林三日電〕蘇聯正圖獲取柏林之經濟控制權，親蘇之工會主席團宣布指定一委員會，依照蘇區之二年計劃，使柏林之工業整體化，並力促全柏林之工人，技師，工程師，雇主及工廠議會支持二年計劃。</p>
<p>〔中央社柏林三日電〕此間蘇聯支持下之共黨所控制之德國人民大會之執行機構德國人民會議今日開會，為蘇區政府擬訂憲法。未來按照新憲法成立之新政府當以「全德政府」之姿態出現。據確息：東德政府將有一徒具虛名之總統，大權均操諸議會第一大黨所推舉之總理之手。</p>
<h3>美參院否決　國會休會建議</h3>
<p>杜魯門總統飛返華府</p>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓二日電〕美參院於二日晚一致投票反對，南部民主黨議員所提特別議會於四日休會之建議。南卡羅里納州民主黨參議員强斯敦提議停止特別議會，其理由為「此間並無有價值之事可以完成」，共和黨議員及民主黨執政派議員聯合加以反對·强斯敦之建議為五十八對十三票所否決。投票贊成立即休會之十三名參議員，即目前對反人頭稅法案作疲勞演說之南部諸州議員。</p>
<p>〔合衆社米蘇里州獨立城三日電〕社魯門總統三日淸晨起身，早餐前赴本州民主黨頸選所投票後，郎於七時五十六分飛赴華盛頓，抵白宮時猶可進晚中飯。起飛前杜氏稱：將與「二三人」共餐，其隨從稱：總統或將立即要求明瞭關於莫斯科談話之消息。</p>

<p>〔合衆社羅馬三日電〕義共黨領袖三日警告稱，政府雖在議會中佔優勢，然工潮及政洽性總龍工仍可使之垮台。同時共報紙亦攻擊政府稱，反罷工法案僅能使義國內爭嚴重化。</p>

<h3>爭取多瑙河航行權　英表示無懼威脅　貝克大使答覆蘇方指責</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕倫敦三日廣播貝爾格勒訊：出席多瑙河會議之英大使貝克，在會議中答覆維辛斯基上週六之言辭稱，「在會議進行中，余決不屈服於任何脅迫或恐嚇，英國代表團決不因維辛斯基之打擊而暴跳。換言之，所謂迹近哀的美敦之最後要求云云，在余腦中固未嘗存在也。對於維辛斯基指責西方國家爲帝國主義者一節，貝克答稱，「試問以多數國家控制內河航運，自他國搬運物資，凡此種種行為，非帝國主義面何？」</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社貝爾格勒二日電〕蘇聯所提之多瑙河公約新草案中，極力强調「多瑙河自由航行之原則，不違背多瑙河各國之利益與主權」。並建議新多瑙河委員會會址，應設在羅為尼亞之加爾泰。在「鐵門」區內應設立蘇羅兩國所組成之管理機構。一九二一年之多瑙河公約應予取銷。</p>
<p>〔美國新聞處華雄頓二日電〕國務院今日向報界發表聲明，在多瑙河會議中，蘇聯與其他東歐國家「堅決」將英文排除，使其不得作為「官方〕語文使用一點，對於會議之進展係屬有害，該聲明謂，「全世界之目光正集中於此項會議，而此項顯屆預先決定以謀通過此項決議之努力，將造成一種不幸之印象。」外傳星期六維辛斯基曾提出實際上等於哀的美敦書之文件，要求與會各國接受東歐諸國對多瑙河之計劃。有以美國對此點究將採取何種立塲相詢者，國務院發言人答稱，美國之立塲將由美駐南大使及出席多瑙河會議美代表團長凱農加以說明。</p>

<h3>數百名美共黨間諜　現仍為蘇聯工作　美前共黨領袖勃頓斯之控訴</h3>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓二日電〕前美共領袖勃頓斯二日指控「現正有數百名共黨為蘇聯作間諜工作而服務於聯邦政府之內」，目前仍在工作之中。勃氏曾為美共領袖達十年，已於一九四五年退出共黨。渠並謂電影業爲匡助共黨活動之大本營。</p>
<p>同時，衆院井美活動委員會代理主席蒙特脫頃宣佈：曾任商務部官員之薛佛馬斯德，已奉命出席該委會陳述，以答覆所控訴曾領導戰期內此問蘇聯間諜組織之詞。蒙氏復稱，一度曾為共黨特務人員之班特萊小姐，上週內曾列舉薛氏及其他聯邦顧員三十餘人為該間諜組織之人員，彼等如有意，以後將被准出席為本人辯護。蒙特脫繼稱，該委會相信現巳擁有足够證據，可立即進行刑事行動。渠復謂該委會或將要求總檢察官克拉克，對政府內間諜活動及共黨活動開始大法官之調查。班小姐之證詞已由勃頓斯加以詳細支持。勃氏證明美國共黨內充滿為蘇聯進行軍事與外交間諜工作之組織，勃頓斯復謂，渠知悉以情報供給蘇聯之美政府官員之姓名，蓋渠曾為共黨政治委員會之委員，曾與若干間諜組織共同工作。</p>
<h3>美國務院內　共黨份子已肅清</h3>
<p>衆議員瓊克曼告國會稱</p>

<h3>日內閣搖欲墜　反罷法案蘆田備受抨擊　九十月間解散議會已無法避免</h3>
<p>〔合衆社東京三日電〕因禁止公務員罷工令而遭受攻擊之蘆田內閣，三日搖搖欲墜。日本觀察家指出：除非盟總立即加以支持，內閣必將垮台。</p>
<p>〔中央社東京三日電〕日政局在未來三月內，勢必定有劇變。因行將於九十月間，召集特別議會期中，現議會之解散，似屬無法避免者。據日觀察家稱：因社會民主黨總裁片山哲，堅持解散議會，故蘆田首相，亦漸形轉變其對此事之原有主見。彼等並指陳二日民主黨人事改組，即為加强該黨陣容之表示。俾資應付議會解散後之總選。</p>
<p>另一事實，令人深感該會殆歸不免於解散者，即為撑持蘆田內閣最力之社會民主黨內部，亦已顯現裂痕。雖社會黨左翼人士勞工大臣加　勘十與內政大臣野溝勝，寗願留任現內閣中，直至衆議紛紛之公務員法修正，獲得具體決定後為止。但該黨其他左翼人士，則嚴詞譴責蘆田內閣，斥其「誤解」盟總來函。且該黨總裁片山哲之不顧大部右翼人士之勸告，竟堅意要求解散議會，亦足徵其本人立塲，似已略微左傾。又社會民主黨左翼人士，曾發表聲明，指責政府稱：禁止公務員集體談判與罷工，乃係遼反遠東委員會之十六條原則，並斥政府故意喧染麥帥來函，以求避免本身責任之錯誤。又現議會之解散，若果不幸言中，則下屆總選後，自必產生較為保守之內閣。</p>
<p>〔新亞社東京三日電〕日政府於今日閣議上通過國家公務員修改案大綱後，又將有一相當時期之休會，全體閣員（包括首相蘆田）均將赴各地作政治演說，聞已定於本月十八日再召集臨時閣議，討論修正公務負法草案。</p>
<h3>韓國閣員名單　民主黨佔多數　財交等四部長已發表</h3>
<p>〔中央社漢城三日電〕韓國總統府本日公佈十一閣員中之四閣員名單時，據政界人士頸料，繼提名總理後刻在親織中之韓國內閣，將為韓國民主黨佔多數之內閣。現托命四閣員中之三，均屬韓國民主黨。全部閣員名單，可望於午夜前公布。已公布之四閣員名單，為財政部長金度演，交通部長閔熙植，司法部長李仁（均為韓國民主黨）農業部長曹奉岩（無黨派）</p>
<p>〔合衆社漢城三日電〕韓國國民黨官方發言人殷露易女士，三日乘機抵此，與李承晚總統會談。一般揣測，渠可能在南韓政府中担任職務，或被任為出席巴黎聯合國大會之韓國代表。</p>

<p>自本市公用事業新價發表後，薪水階級已感不勝負担，而各公司方面猶以為未能漲足，認為當局過於硬抑。昨據市參議會前公用事業調查委員會負責調查公司賬目之參議員虞舜姜豪等談稱：公用事業中如上海電力公司，電話公司等，對外常宣稱不勝虧累，吾人若加以分析，其實頗多不合情理之處。第一，其開支項下薪津一項，尤以外籍人員為最鉅，不特底薪頗高，月支美金數千元，且竟以黑市計算，因之高級人員月支法幣達數百億元之譜者，比比皆是。黑市金鈔一漲，薪給隨之提高，公司開支益形龐大，但是市民所　者為法幣。第二，各公司所需材料之外匯，政府時予優待一次結匯或貸款等，而各公司於計長賬目中，似未加考慮。</p>
<p>又參議員張中原，莊平，費樹聲等，爲公用事業售價漲價過高，將於參議會日內召開之公用小組會議中，提出緊急動議，一致反對。</p>

<h3>吳市長昨晨赴郊外　向千餘難童訓話　「市長」向市長提出一項要求　營養不良希望增加經費</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕昨晨九時，吳市長應漕河涇上海市立中國兒童教養所之邀，偕交際科長張彼德蒞臨該所，對一千五百名難童訓話，並由米高梅影片公司派攝影師王小亭攝入鏡頭，成為「中國兒童生活」影片中之一部份。</p>

<h3>金絲籠中雀　情塲失意人　苦命的上海小組　謝家驊仰毒遇救</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕去年曾以淺水灣事件名噪香港之「上海小姐」謝家　，返滬後經親友調解，原已與其夫榮梅華和好如初。詎半年以來，因榮始終未踐諾言，對謝之行動旣管束　嚴，對其張姓情婦則又不願脫離關係，謝以空閑寂寞，抑鬱寡歡，自思遇人不淑，乃萌厭世之念，上月二十四日夜間突吞服安眠藥片自殺，幸灌救迅速，未陷險境，嗣即入醫院療養一週，咋始出院。</p>
<p>據謝稱：榮在未與渠結合前已先有兩婦，惟均已仳離，留有子女八人。自謝重返夫家後，榮即責令摒絕交際，撫育諸兒。謝深苦行動不能自由，嘗憤對榮謂：「早知你需要一個管家婆，當初又何必追求我」！榮則極力表示實由於深切愛渠而出此。但嗣後榮常徹夜不歸，經謝偵知渠仍與張姓情婦同居於其福履理路之自建洋房中，故又催促早辦脫輻手續，而榮則稱情婦對離異條件要求過苛，反詰謝謂：「你果眞愛我，何忍使我為此事破產」？謝見事無可為，怨憤之餘乃有此舉</p>
<p>怔忡成病　服藥催眠</p>
<p>謝自去年一度與榮鬧翻，精神輒感怔忡，且以上述原因，致鬱結成病，醫生常勸服安眠藥劑，故謝積有安眠藥片達九片之多。廿四日夜十一時，謝候榮不至，芳心　　，遂於迷惘中將藥片盡行吞服。迨榮聞訊趕歸，對謝頓足稱：「你這樣呌我如何做人」？最近謝出院後認為榮始終缺乏誠意，夫妻間感情已難以維繫，堅決要求離婚。</p>
<p>面子有關　不允離異</p>
<p>但榮以地位，事業，面子關係，堅決不允離異。謝之家屬鑒於榮輕諾寡信，表示若果欲再矢愛好，必須渠提供一有效保證，並出立筆據。惟榮又辯稱：「結婚可寫字據，離婚也可寫字據，在這當中的字據如何寫法？」謝因曾經藥石，形容憔瘁，病楊支頤，含淚唏噓，頻稱前年忙「競選」，去歲拍電影，豪情盛概，猶如昨日，詎料覓得歸宿後，反受盡折磨，對此人世浮沉，表示已感與味紫然矣。</p>

<h3>關於申請助學問題總答覆　應備何種條件？怎樣申請？可得多少？</h3>
<p>本報讀者助學金委員會近一月來接護全市各級學校淸寒學生函電紛馳，戚親自來館詢問秋季助學金者，為數殊多，除已分別作復外，深恐外界仍多不明助金內容，特彙集所有問題，擬總答復如后：</p>
<p>（一）學生須備何種條件，方可申請助學金</p>
<p>〔答〕申請學生須（甲）家境淸寒，（乙）品性純正，體格健全，（丙）學業優良，平均成績在前列三分之一以內，或有特殊專長，堪以深造，及（丁）未得本校免費或他種助金者。</p>
<p>（二）肄業何種學校，方可申請助學金？</p>
<p>〔答〕凡肄業已立案之私立初中·高中·大學、專科學校，均得申請，公立·市立·省立·國立者不准。</p>
<p>（三）申請書何時可發？</p>
<p>〔答〕須開學時分別發出。即初高中九月初，大學專科九月中旬。</p>
<p>（四）申請手續，應如何辦理？</p>
<p>〔答〕（甲）學生先向學校報名登記，</p>
<p>（乙）經學校校長及主任教師認為合格，願予推　者，得代向本報讀者助學金委員會領取申請書。（丙）由學生塡寫申請書，並粘貼二寸半身照相交還學校，（丁）由校長塡寫推薦書，與申請書一併彙送本報讀者助學金委員會審核。</p>
<p>（五）上屆申請，一切均符手續，何以仍未核准？</p>
<p>〔答〕經本報初審及格後，彙交上海市獎學金統一審核委員會復審，該會須憑各校造報百分之二十之免費名册核對，查明未曾請准他處助金，品學兼優、而又從未參加非法活動者，方可核准。換言之，上述四種規定，有一不合，即無核准希望。</p>
<p>（六）申報助學金，審核程序如何？</p>
<p>〔答〕本報所發申請書，經校長負責推薦，由本報初審，彙交獎學金統審會複審及格後，即可發給助學金。</p>
<p>（七）助學金能否照學費實數發給？</p>
<p>〔答〕此點須視捐款多寡而定，並須遵照獎學統審會規定之標準。以過去而言，大槪助學金佔學費之七成。目前學費激增，而申請學生過多，維持七成之數，恐亦不易。</p>
<p>（八）每有家境頗好之學生，亦申請助金，應如何防止？</p>
<p>〔答〕每屆申請學生中，確有少數家境頗好之學生，留領助金，本報決設法防止；希望谷校學生切實檢舉，遇有此項情形，隨時來函告發；自當澈查。尤望各校校長，愼重推薦，不敷衍，不徇情，則此項弊端，不致發生。</p>

<h3>法律釋疑　科學時代的怪事　八字不合解除婚約</h3>
<p>江耀昌問敝親某甲（男）於民卅二年由父母作主與某乙（女）訂婚，今發覺乙方慌報年齡，經重合八字，始知彼此不合，現擬將婚約解除，請問（一）未成年時父母所代訂之婚約可否加以否認？（二）乙方並無過失，燼以八字不合為理由，可否解除婚約？（三）訂辦時之聘禮，可否向乙方追還，如乙方不還應如何應付？（四）可否單方面登報聲明解除婚約與丙女訂婚？</p>
<p>〔唐鳴時先生解答〕　（一）男未滿十七歲，女未滿十五歲，不得訂定婚約（參民法九百七十三條）。在此年齡以上之未成年人，訂定婚約，應得法定代理人之同意（參同法九百七十四條）。婚約，應由當事人自行訂定（同法第九百七十二條）。換言之，即當事人不同意，不可訂約是也。未成年人父母代訂之婚約，並非根本無效；可廣與否，全在男女當事人同意與否。（二）男女年齡如相距太遠，據生理學者所舉理由，相婚似不相宜；但感情似又超越此限制也。且若一歲之差，而相差又屬較幼；不知甲方何以據以存解約之意？法律上雖有誠實成約之說，但本件似難構成重大詐欺。八字之說，更不足為法律上解約之理由。（三）損害賠償，須以過失為前提。若解約之過失不在乙方，或甲方解約之理由不充分，即談不到損害賠償。因追還騁　，為賠償之一種也。（四）如不顧一切，即不具備解約條件而破壤巳訂定之婚約，則用方應負損害賠償之責。</p>

<h3>國行遵循兩大原則　嚴格審核應付外匯　對於僑匯處理將另定新方案</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕國行外匯審核委員會，昨日上午十一時舉行第二次委員會議，李立俠林崇塘邵會華等均出席，由召集人夏晋熊主持。對外匯審核之原則有所決定。據夏局長表示：本　之設立，為統籌支付政府及商人及留學生等所需之外匯，央行所屬經辦外匯各單位，均改隸該會，非進口外匯審核會則改名為非進口外匯審核小組，商人進口外匯之審核仍由輸管會辦理，惟保險費及佣金部份則由本會審查。今後審核時，遵循嚴格及公開兩大原則。非限額進口之外匯，決嚴格審核，旅行游覽性質之外匯，尤所不許，即國際性之會議，亦視其重要性而定可否。商人及留學生部份之外匯審核，完全公開，以釋羣疑，而免引起不必要之麻煩。又政府為謀外匯收支之平衡起見，決於普通頸算之外，另立一外匯預算，昨日行政院外匯審核委員會開會時，巳正式通過編製外匯預算。</p>
<p>又訊：政府為增加僑匯收八，充實外匯頭寸起見，不久將制定新方案公佈實施。將來僑匯除按結匯證明書出售外，尚可獲得津貼百分之廿五，一切手續費及匯費均豁免。此訊傳出後，昨日本市結匯證明書之售價激昇，已出五百萬關。</p>
<h3>買戶踟躕不前　華股趨勢萎頓</h3>
<p>華股昨以業外亳無助力，實貨有疲無俏，脆弱之買戶，知難而退，以致永紗近午慘告跌停，過程遂怯疲而十分恍惚。</p>
<p>晨開時穩定，永鈔以一二八〇〇元登塲，自一一八三〇元起，六五號八三號一六〇號二三號一一號一〇二號二一八號二一六號一三號一〇六號一五五號二二四七一號一六三號一四五號一一五號九五號一一一號紛紛力售，即告步降至一一九〇〇元。五四號一八〇號二一八號二〇六號一八五號一四五號一一號七一號略補，升為一二三〇〇元。但廣帮賣胃不怠，紗布實貨見疲，恐慌又起，二二四號二二二號八九號一一一號二一三號二二六號一五五號八五號四號二〇七號二〇六號一二〇號五五號六五號二號紛售，終告退至一一四三〇元跌停板。近午由九九號八〇號六七號二二八號一八七號一五四號吸收，一一九號五一號一五一號五五號四號則出而趨盤，一五四號四七號一八〇號一三號維持，午牧為一一五五〇元。除永業漲停，梅林恒豐小挫，信誼尚平，美亞信和新光統益內衣景綸永公華豐新華各跌一成，餘低半成。</p>
<p>後市永紗以一一九〇〇元開始，一四五號九五號一四號即賣到一一六八〇元，一三一號七六號六九號二二四號一六八號二〇五號八九號來進，而升為一二〇七〇元。榮豐跌停人心仍極脆弱，一三五號一六九號一六四號四號一四五號一一號二一六號賣到一一七三〇元，一四三號二一八號九九號一四五號一五五號一二號維持，二二四號七二號一八〇號九七號七六號六五號一五六號九五號則出，徘徊不定。國行仍屬差出，二〇七號二一九號八九號進至一一八〇〇元收市，較晨收計榮豐跌停，聯地漲停，信誼統益閘北尚平，景綸漲半成，信和勸與火柴小挫，餘均微升。塲外各未上市股票均未能振作，尤以華商大生等回小半成為疲。</p>
<p>公債</p>
<p>昨亦軟化，五五二室先出後進，大成與買進，五〇〇室三六〇室五〇三室賣出。統丙晨開一二二萬，自一二三萬起，退至一一一萬收市，較前收計甲乙丙丁各低五萬元，戊種降六萬元，成交二百萬。</p>
<h3>銀錢業改拆息</h3>
<p>關於存放款及同業日拆，頃經銀錢信託三公會會議決定，自今（四日）起改訂為存款日拆每千元二元一角，同業日拆每千元十一元，放款日拆每千元十三元云</p>
<h3>銀根走勢尚平　行局續有差出</h3>
<p>昨日本市銀樓走勢尚稱平穩，四行二局一庫於票據交換中，仍有差出，總額共一〇七九億。就中中央銀行差出九二六三億，中國銀行差進一四二一二億，交通銀行差進五二五一億，農民銀行差出八一〇二億，中信局差出二七〇六億，郵匯局差進五〇一億，中央合作金庫差出九七三億。商業行莊大交換差進六〇一〇億，小交換差出一三四五〇億，外商銀行共計差進八五一九億。</p>
<p>據國　　　　　：行局差出之原因為：（一）支付軍政機關之款項，（二）外銷物資之匯款，（三）購買麵粉之款項。惟央行對市塲情形，隨時密切注意，如有波動，即以抽緊銀根對付。</p>
<h3>茶商昨謁俞總裁　請提高茶貸數額</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕本年度茶實，業經四聯總處核准，州度增加，該業近以物價激漲，成本提高，又再度請求增加茶買。央行俞總裁特於昨日約晤茶業公會理事長唐季綱，及茶業協會理事宋啟範，垂詢該業實况。書俞國錢當時對茶業之痛苦，有詳盡報告，俞氏當允設法補救，交貼放會審核後，再提請四聯理事會決定，茶貸之再度增加，已有希望。</p>
<h3>外銷茶沉寂</h3>
<p>向以　銷印度孟買，蔚為六宗之　屯特實，過程在呆頓多持中，昨突告復歷。綠彼地雖力謀自產自足，惟終受風土關係，出品終不及華茶之色香味俱備，是以最近對於該項花色，又有問津之勢，惜此間存　缺乏，故交易並未展開，但市氣則一路疾進。其他花色，亦一致跟隨見秀。至於內銷茶，執主雖仍扳抬，但在連日帶挺後，所升已多，加以進方胃納似巳足够，市面遂乏力再漲，結果各呈原途　旋。</p>
<h3>銀根軋緊人心萎疲　紗·布·一·致·挫·跌</h3>
<p>昨日棉·市况，以銀根仍緊，客路實銷絕樣進展，本街納意亦懈，多頭續有吐魯，市氣萎靡。</p>
<p>四十二支藍鳳細紗，初開因傳經濟管制新方案，不日即將公佈，實物市塲仍多束縛，一般浮多急於脫手，因此喊價　挫一億。詎開敝後，買戶不動，行情再降五千萬。迨近收時，客帮見低添補，回好至二十億，卒以十九億二千萬元結束，與上日軋跌八千萬元．</p>
<p>二十一支雙馬紗，開後需求不弱，徵秀千萬，嗣因紡建公司　有拋紗，價低八千萬，市氣轉慮，走勢乏力，卒以十五億一千萬站住，比上日跌小六千萬元。其餘各支租紗細紗，亦都下挫三四千萬至七八千萬不一，成交僅五十二件。</p>
<p>昨日棉布市場，因行局對行莊管制更嚴，拆放緊縮，市上銀根軋緊，本街實銷呆滯，染廠亦多觀望，漢口帮且乘高求售，天津帮則出細布套進元直貢呢，是以龔頭細布開高後，即一路瀉至五千三百七十萬元站定，較上日步降一百八十萬元。</p>
<p>中檔之五福及喇叭童細布，與龍頭拔開過多，引起同業套買，市盤一度見俏，結果五福軋跌一百五十萬，喇叭童小一二百萬。其他嗶嘰細斜士林布等，均呈跌過於漲之勢。</p>
<p>又訊：午後塲外龍頭細布價喊五千四百八十萬，步降至四百萬元，較午收升卅萬元。</p>
<p>又訊：紡建公司標售之五福細布，自塡價聞為四千四五百萬元，四君十元嗶嘰五千三百五十萬至四百五十萬元。另有跳鯉漂布印花嗶嘰真質，及三Ａ彩球細布等十五種，申　者寥寥無幾。</p>
<p>又訊：中紡昨開售棉紗十六種，發出准購單三四四張，售出為布一八，六六〇疋，被單一〇〇條。廠家准購單二張，棉布一六〇疋，共計發出准購單三四六張棉布一八，八二〇疋，被單一〇〇條，價值九八，七一三，〇〇〇萬元。又代紗管會售出紗三種，准購單八戶，售出紗四九件，價值六，七〇六，〇〇〇萬元。</p>
<h3>八月份配煤價格　漲百分之一七〇</h3>
<p>昨據燃管會負責人向記者談稱：生活指數調整，物價均直綫上升，致使各煤產區礦商開支龐大，無法維持。故各礦商向燃管會要求關於八月份煤斤配售價格及產地價格，必需予以合理調整，至少應漲三倍，始可勉强支持，否則只有停止生產。惟燃管會對於各礦商之請求，認為增加過鉅，影響物價上漲，難以全部接受。運日開會討論，迄昨日下午為止，大致已決定，准予上漲百分之一百七十。今日起，將按照新價實行云。</p>
<h3>物資財委會擬訂　物資貨欵原則</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕國行物資財務委員會，昨日午後五時舉行第四次會議，由召集人李立俠主席。通過購糧貸款，原則以實物貸放為主。並擬訂一般物資貸放原則，俟徵求該行貼放委員會意見後，再作決定。</p>

<h3>去化呆滯交易清稀　食米市況平定　粉糧油餅價均下游</h3>
<p>米市欲升乏力，初開繼上日收市之堅勢，貨主繼續喊高，但去化殊呆，盤旋後即見萎落，塲外各物下降，使人心虛疲。米店以本月份戶口米發售伊始，門售不振，納胃甚淡，是以交易頗為淸稀。結果較上日稍昂五十萬，新粳到貨漸多，獨降一百萬，秈米交稀價定。昨日到貨南北二市共計五九一五石。</p>
<p>麺粉疲軟下降，實銷淸淡，去化呆滯，業外各物下降，殊使人心疲軟，故開市即陷入萎麼狀態，終告下降三四十萬元。老車粉一三七〇萬收市，計降三十萬，兵船粉由一二七〇萬開盤，一度曾至一二九〇萬，終仍以開市之價收市，計挫四十五萬元，麩皮降六七十萬。</p>
<p>雜糧齊驅下坡，客帮納胃不佳，本銷亦淡，市由虛而削，黃豆廠胃亦薄，終降一百五十至二百萬，蠶豆挫五十萬，紅糧降百萬元，苞米元麥北帮去化不佳，降落二百萬元。菉豆價雖站定，惟銷路亦呆。芝蔴略有參差，大致亦挫一二百萬，生仁上日退交甚多，昨乃降落六七百萬元。</p>
<p>食油下跌，因黃豆等各糧均降，加之圈外物價一均報低，人心至感不振，生油因有到貨，疾退更鉅，吉桶生油一億一千萬收市，猛降一千萬之鉅。豆油生菜油回籠貨吐售甚多，各降三百萬元，豆油大都為八六〇〇萬，小車蔴油降六百萬元。豆餅售多納少，計降五六十萬元。</p>
<h3>特種外幣存單　迄今仍未核發</h3>

<h3>一路領先捷報初傳　我籃球隊勝比利時　三六比三四延長時間分勝負　李世僑登塲氣勢大振</h3>
<p>〔中央肚倫敦三日電〕我世運籃球綠昨晚　比利時隊于哈林蓋球塲，激戰四十五分績，離決勝負，卒于延長之五分鐘時間內，險勝比利時隊，比數為卅六對卅四。演出過程，緊張萬分，我隊得前鋒李世僑為生力軍，增强實力不少。整個比賽中，我隊始終領先，足見勝來並非　倖。距終塲七分鑲時，我綠尚領先七分，但以後投籃欠準，即宋能添分。比利時隊于最後掙扎中，淨入三球，及罰中一分，竟扳成平手。比賽時問延長五分鐘後，我隊攻入兩球，又超出對方四分，對方亦投入一球，終以二分之差，敗於我隊。昨晚之比賽開塲，即有緊湊神速之表演。黃天錫跳球後，我隊即取得主動，但以投籃久準，未能中鵠，比綠投籃中的，首創紀錄。李世僑·蔡文華（隊長）各進一球，後來居上，此後我隊，一直領先，各前鋒出手快捷，投　姿勢美觀，使比隊後防招架困難，上半時十八對十三，我隊佔先五分。休息後再戰，我隊又增二分，各鋒傳遞與投籃之巧妙，大受觀衆讚賓。比賽將終時，黃天錫被罰出塲，全隊頓受影響。距終塲四分鐘時，比隊急起直追，扳成卅二對卅二平手。延長時問後，我隊兩罰奠定勝局，比隊卒告敗北。按我隊此次勝利之主要原因，在于後衛黃天錫與包松圓二人籃下控制之得力，及蔡李吳三鋒聯絡良好，投籃準確之故。又昨晚之比賽中，得分最多者為蔡文華十五分，李世僑入分，吳成韋七分。</p>
<p>〔合衆社倫敦二日電〕中國籃球隊二日晚出戰比利時隊，中國之五呎二吋「短小精悍」名將李惟僑，病愈上陣，中比兩隊演出精彩，難分高低，在延時間再戰中，中國卒以卅六比卅四，力擒比利時。中國隊先佔優勢，比隊後來居上頻頻添分，於法定時問終了時，造成三十二對三十二平手。延長時間再戰，一般僉信身體强大之比利時，對勝利必操左券，但輕視了中國隊之「小李」「老包。」包松圓獲得兩次罰球權，「老包」在千五百名觀衆高呼聲中，不負衆望，兩記空心球，成三十四—三十二，小李綢之，亦獲得罰球機會，依樣胡蘆，兩罰兩中，三十六—三十二。比利時之自萊勃不甘示弱，隻手揮入一球，追成三十六—三十四。比隊獲球，向中國腹地進製時，鐘聲長嗚時間告終，中國以三十六比三十四，一球勝比利時。</p>
<p>〔合衆社倫敦二日電〕中國籃球隊二日晚力克比利時隊後，比利時以驚人行動向世運官員提出對此役結果之抗議。比利時之抗議，定三日下午五時予以聽取，比隊抗議理由，直至屆時始予公佈。</p>
<h3>籃球冷門　智利大敗菲律賓　美國險勝阿根廷</h3>
<p>〔合衆社倫敦三日電〕高頭大馬之智利籃球隊，二日突以顚峯狀態出現，六十八對三十九，痛擊最具分組冠軍希望之菲列賓隊。智利旣勝，當可晋入最後八隊，智利隊員每人至少中籃一次，尤以孟哈那表演出色，個人獨得十八分。菲隊戰來大為失常，以身材不如人，故籃下球盡失，而本來佳妙之射籃身手，竟亦不知何往。兩陣初圓，菲隊即以六比四領先，然孟哈那如出柙猛虎，各種角度投籃，莫不得心應手，一罰一擲，智利反而超出，其後即始終控制大局，上半時廿九比十六，智利領先。易地後，智利仍不放鬆，雷田馬及賈樂兩人更見卯上，結果三十九對六十八，菲列賓敗走麥城。</p>

<p>〔中央社倫敦三日電〕衆目所矚之菲律賓籃球隊，今竟以卅九對六十八敗於智利，我籃球前於上月卅日初度登傷時，亦以五分之差敗於智利，然當日名前鋒李世喬因病未能出戰，我國籃球隊與菲。比·韓國·智利·伊拉克同屬第二組，昨晚我以卅六對卅四擊敗比利時，伊拉克乃同組六隊中最弱之一環，已分別以數十分之差，大敗於韓國及菲律賓，故我隊之輕取伊拉克，乃意中事，若我隊今晚能戰敗韓國，則其獲得決賽權之希望，當益趨明朗。</p>

<h3>我足球隊先逢勁敵　四比零敗於土耳其　土軍名不虛傳實力可畏</h3>
<p>〔中央社倫敦三日電〕足球初賽，我國已以四比〇敗於土耳其，比賽係昨日下午在華桑七道體育塲舉行，强勁之土耳其隊，於下半時比賽中，竟在五分鐘內運進三球，堪稱奇跡。我隊上半時尚能力阻土隊，四十五分鐘終塲時，土隊僅護得一球。綜觀整個過程，設非守門張邦輪及後衛侯榕生後防稱職，我隊失球，當不止此數。侯之右後衛有特出表演，張之守門亦救出險球不少，下半時土隊攻勢熾烈，四分範內，先後在廿五碼處射入兩球，不足二分鐘時又護一球，下半時開始廿五分鐘時，我隊左翼朱永强腿傷離塲，遂以十人應戰。兩隊皆因雨後塲地泥濘，踢來未見敏摧。開賽後土隊前鋒首先發難，向我陣猛犯，幸有侯榕生數度將球踢出，總計上半時土隊至少向我方叩門六次，僅在十八分鐘時，攻入一球。我隊亦曾多次向敵方攻門，但未開紀錄。下半時將終塲時，我隊急起直追，加緊展開攻勢，但未能衝破堅强之土隊後防。我隊朱永强傷腿出塲，對我前鋒不無影響，終塲前我前鋒雖一鼓作氣，發動猛攻，卒未能打入對方後防，獲得射門機會。</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕倫敦三日廣播：中國足球隊，昨日於風雨中以〇比四被土耳其擊敗，在第一週中慘遭淘汰，上半時零比一。第一週賽，其他三塲，瑞典，義大利，朝鮮得勝。</p>
<p>角球頭頂　土軍傑作</p>
<p>中國之敗，在前鋒未能突擊土耳其之中央防衛，偶有良機，亦未能鎮靜把握，作有効之射門。後衛方面，頭球軟弱，於是每有高球，即頓成土軍天下。土隊翼鋒葛勒生落點奇佳之角球，尤使中國守將束手。第一球之失，即係被土隊中鋒希力克，乘角球之便頂入。</p>
<p>中國前鋒，在土衛嚴密看管下，亦問有良好演出。朱永强雖被釘殺，何應芬。謝文良俱屢有妙射，惜均被土耳其球門救出。上半時終結前，劉松生且曾射中績楣。土耳其隊名不虛傳，其實力足與英職業除相抗衡。角球頭頂，供有獨特表演，前鋒尤兇猛可怕。</p>
<p>永強看煞　鋒綫破碎</p>
<p>比賽於六時半在華森斯泰球塲展開。不絕之絲絲細雨，使塲濕球重，影響短小靈活之中國球員不少。土軍陣裏多魁梧大漢，在難以控制之濕地上，佔得不少便宜。中國先攻，但被阻於土耳其後衛，朱永强數度猛竄，亦無所獲，反引起土衛對渠之注意，被伊蓋恩緊釘，此碩偉之土軍中堅，與短小之中國中鋒，此後即如形之與影，亦步亦趨，終塲未再分離，中國鋒綫，因此支離斷碎，土隊後防之威脅，亦因以减少。</p>
<p>頭頂進球　紀録打開</p>
<p>上半塲將過半時，土耳其反攻，五鋒賴淸脆之短傳，滲入中國後防，中鋒希力克在近門處勁射，張邦綸飛身撲成角球，中國方慶大難不死，不料葛勒生開來，落點極佳，希力克候個正着，頂入網角，先開紀錄。中國全力反攻，何應芬，劉松生先後叩關，俱被門將救出，二度得角球之利，亦因頭低一着，無功而還。最後一分鐘，劉松生得機妙射，士門將撲救不及，眼看行將入網，扳成平手，詎知時運不齊，竟略差毫厘，中橫楣，萬千觀衆，齊聲惋惜。</p>
<p>邦綸大忙　又失三球</p>
<p>下半塲開始，即見張邦綸奮不顧身，自葛勒生脚下搶撲危球之精彩表演。數分鐘後，又見張跳水式之仆倒救球，博得滿塲彩聲。</p>
<p>十七分後，希力克於廿碉外挑射左上角，再建一功。中國隊受此打擊，微見散亂，土軍乘機再攻，又陷一城，成三比〇。最後，土內　安當雅底斯於近門處，在亂軍中蹴入，遂以四比〇晋入第二週，將與瑞典會戰。</p>

<p>自由談獨醒篇  季用　　連日溽暑，老鼠又在大逞威風，甚至可以登床入幄，於是通靑失眠，聽相鄰的人們鼾擊齁齁，眞電痛苦萬分，因此想到時人屈原的名句，衆人皆醉我獨醒，實在是一種難於忍受的塲面，無怪乎他要忿而從彭咸之所居，去練習游泳了。　　設想一個「衆人皆醒我獨醉」的局面，是怎麼樣的呢？無疑的，我將為衆醒者所笑，所揶揄，在宴會間看到那些淺量而又喜歡多吃的朋友常有這種笑話可看。然而其人當時並不感到痛苦，原因是他已竟醉了，醉就是糊塗，糊塗是「難得」的，我們看他可笑之際，他也許正得意忘形，以為自己了不起呢。局外人也許覺得是悲劇，可是局內人却全不覺得；所謂苦樂，本是主觀的，於別人以為可悲之時，取得快樂，正如別人都困苦的時候而我却得一注意外之財一般可賀，容或等到醒了之後，有點難為情，此亦正如南柯夢醒，黃梁米熟，一塲熱鬧總算經歷了，就是提起來，也是一種高興的難為情。隨園詩話有一則邯鄲題壁云：「四十年中公與侯，雖然是夢也風流，我今落魄邯鄲道，要替先生借枕頭！」其實可以代表一般人的想望與心理，固不止如袁君所誇獎的翻陳出新而已。岳鍾琪罷官後又起用，去征大小金川，路過邯鄲也有題句云：「只因未了麜實事，又作封侯夢一塲」。這分明是撒嬌的話，什麼塵寰神仙，誰都會明白，在人間有封侯也便是神仙，否則一切全是否定。所以醉了雖然不算是高明，而一般人却趨之若驚者，其中自大有因緣在也。　　醒了的就難。衆人皆享邯鄲夢境之趣，而你一個人聽老鼠在吱吱，在進入抽斗中嚙食書物，看鬼眨眼的星星，悶氣，出汗，這可不是更加難嗎？世俗所云，臥榻之旁，豈客他人酣睡，其情誠然可惡，蓋即不是我的臥榻，而是鄰居，聽了都不受用，更不用說在我的榻上展轉自如了！假如不是酣睡而是淸醒，那就　是一回事，古人有連床夜話，或抵足聽雨的設法，有了伴侶豈不好？所難者，來占臥榻的人，抱着與我們夜話而解我們岑家者幾乎沒有，而是借了枕頭過　　夢癮的居多，此其所以情理難恕，忍無可忍者也。屈子的話，也許正為此乎？　　抑又有進一層者，德夢據說是人類潛意識活動的時候，理智在此時已失去效用。醒時是陶淵明，醉時或睡時何嘗不可以作史彌遠劉裕弈劻賈似道？五斗米不肯折腰，還許是因為太少呢，—如今也就是二千萬呀！—若是五石米呢，說不定就折他一記！嘴裹說得那麼響，怎好馬上自己打嘴吧，現在到了醉裏夢裏，不特別人可以原該，通自己都可以找到自恕的理由。小說中責人常有：「休推醉裹夢裹！」可見如果眞的在醉夢中，未嘗不可取得諒解。賢明的讀者應該明白，醉之所以不如醒在此，醒之所以更不如醉尤其在此！這樣一來，醒着的對了多數醉夢中人就更難對付了，—是非是取決多數的，易卜生的定理「少數永遠是對的」不過一句牢騷，不能擺到議事規程裏。—黑的可以變作白，白的可以變作黑，賈誼和屈子所憤怒的瓦缶·鉛刀，可惜的黃鐘·莫邪，殆即此故。所謂以「心之察察，受物之汶汶，」怎麼可以應付得了！在此種局面之下，除去找彭咸去游泳之外，恐怕只有一種藥可治，—安眠藥片。　　安眠藥片也在漲價中，買不起，否則我眞要下決心了。大秤  如意　　十六世紀時，歐洲人以捕殺女巫為能事，他們說女巫有妖術，常當騎了掃帚在空中飛行。一個婦女要是被認為有女巫的嫌疑，就常被大衆活活燒死，即使她確係寃枉，也沒有申述的機會。但地方官吏中不乏明智之士，他們見衆怒難犯，就想出了一個巧妙的方法：在鬧市縱立一具大天平秤，羣衆捉到了「女巫」後，那些菅吏就和顏悅色的叫他們把那個女人秤一秤，秤好之後就把她的體重宣佈，同時聲明，這樣重的身體是不可能騎在掃帶上飛行的—羣衆旣無話可說，那個女人的性命就保全了。至今荷蘭的村莊通衢中，還可以看得見這種天平秤。記阿蓮  自蕉　　認得三五字，時時學寫忙，泥爺削鉛筆，要娘尋紙　、吃飯忽思便，上床又索糖，愛人道漂亮，喜着新衣裳，　言又自語，對鏡細端詳。　　坐脫雙小襪，行拖大人鞋，栗碌佈枕被，哄睡洋娃娃，撕得半條紙，鼻涕呼爺揩，上　復上欖，問娘乘不乖，有時縱聲哭，泥娘要上街。　　吃飯先吃菜，菜盡飯不動，哄究一頓飯，滿地如布種。嘖嘖自呼雞，怒之亦旣寵，放之地上行，聳肩復喜踴。　　七手八隻脚，洗衣一身水，娘罵不關心，自言亦能此。看爺寫蘭花，笑爺不能似。日月要人扶，天上思奇士，阿爺有苦心，所恨心不死，尊邊淚如繩，阿蓮空瞪視，爺是優書生，恨汝非男子！羅素論科學氣質  則仕　　自報載不食的楊妹並非不食之後，我看見了好多篇嘲笑中國科學家不科學的文章，大意是說：根據科學，人絕對不能不食而活命，中國科學家對於絕對不合科學的絕食楊妹大忙特忙，大驚小怪，殊屬不合科學云云。　　我並不懂科學，中國科學家對於楊妹事件之起勁是否合於科學，原不敢贊一詞。恰巧今晚讀羅素懷疑論集，其中十二章論自由思想與官廳煽動有論及科學氣質之言，覺得不妨一抄，其言曰：（據嚴旣澄譯文，商務版）　　「近年以來，我們曾經有過一個絕好的榜樣，可以拿來說明我們心中的科學氣質，那便是相對論的學說，和牠在世界上所受到的歡迎。相對論的提出者愛因斯坦……關於相對論的預言，……為英國特派出去觀察一九一九年的日蝕遠征隊證實了。他的學說把傳統的物理學的全部骨架搗毀了；牠之不利於正統的動力學，差不多就同達爾文的學說之不利於聖經的創世紀一樣。然而世界各處的物理學者之對於他的學說，則在所得到的證據一經證明是有利於牠的以後，便都表示出極敏捷的承認的態度來，絕不因為牠推翻了千百科學家所辛苦建成的全部物理學的骨幹便對牠懷着一點兒的憎忌。可是這許多的贊許相對論者之中，卻沒有一個人會認定愛因斯坦已經獲得了最後的最圓滿的成功——愛因斯坦尤其不會如此想，他並不曾建立了一個永久不能推倒的信條的紀念碑，可以卓立千古的。在今日的物理學中，依然還有一些非他所能解決的難題；將來也總有他的學說要被人修改的一日，一如牠在目前之修改牛敦的學說一樣。這種的批評的，非獨裁的虛心容納，正是科學的眞態度。一　　又云：　　「凡是一個眞的具有科學的眼光的科學家，決沒有不以絕頂虛心的態度，而情願承認在今日已經算是及格的科學的智識，都一定要隨着發見的進步而需要修正和補充的。……我們在今日所能够在其中找到最迫近於純正的智識的地方，只有科學，而在科學中，則人類的態度和眼光，却只能被認為試臉的和充滿了錯誤的。」羅素之言當然不是金科玉律—羅素自己尤其不會如此想。但作為一種與我們不同的科學氣質觀，我覺得是可供一讀的，而假如我是研究楊妹的科學家之一，尤其要引證之以對付嘲笑我的諸君。不求甚解  錢大成　　陶淵明自稱讀書不求甚解，於是後世馬馬虎虎讀書的人都自謂「不求甚解」，其實大誤而特誤。淵明所謂「甚」，乃是老子一去太去甚」之「甚」，也就是儒家「過猶不及」的「過」。讀書了解古人，要恰到好處，不宜穿　附會，也不應深文羅織。第一要得到古人之意，不宜「刻舟求劍」，淵明所謂：「此中有眞意，欲辨已忘言」。求甚解是斤斤於古人的言，忘卻古人的意。十三經注疏是力求甚解，結果呢，對於古人之意反而愈弄愈晦澀了。馮浩箋注李商隱詩，是力求甚解，結果更令讀者莫名其妙，投入五里霧中，其病根在於穿　附會。專制帝王對於異己者的文字，也是力求甚解。如明太祖對於一個和尚的謝恩表中間的這兩句話：「天生聖人，為世作則。」竟疑心那個和尚譏笑他是和尚和一盜賊出身，而把他殺掉。他的理由是「生」跟「僧」，「則」跟「賊」都是諧音。淸世宗為了一個考官出了「維民所止」的題目，也治以大辟之刑，因為他以為「維」「止」兩個字是把「雍正」切頭。這是深文羅織。淵明所處的時代，在學術方而是充滿着「穿鑿附會」的風氣，在政治方面是漫佈着「深文羅織」的空氣，他自己是一個自由主義者，呼吸到老莊的氣息，接受到孔孟的傳統，冶道家儒家為一爐，竭力求「中」，竭力「去甚」。世界上任何學術思想和文藝的最高境界，都是恰到好處的。淵明的偉大即在於此。後世讀書人的不求甚解，那是讀書無成的人借着淵明的話解嘲罷了。　　觀察世事的態度，也因該不求甚解，完全不體驗，那是糊塗；太精明了，不免流為尖刻。有了「採菊東籬下，悠然見南山」的胸襟，纔會達到「久在樊籠裘，復得返自然」的境界。　　講的話已多，再說下去未免流為甚解了。就此帶住。小兩點  施濟美　　我們對於最愛的人，和最恨的人一樣的苛求，比起來似乎對於前者有更多的不能原諒。　　愛美的人聽着：假使你希望人家頌揚你的美貌，最好你就沒有善心，沒有眞情，沒有才藝……。如此，人家就會專一的記得你的美貌了　　假使你有安恬的心，即使在最喧譁的鬧市中，你也仍然可以獨享到淸靜與太平。　　真珠沒有光彩，但自有其內在的輝煌。　　呌一個佣人陪你吃一頓飯，並非就算消除了階級制度；給大街上的鳳陽婆子一萬塊錢，也能謂之大善士麼？　　很少的女人在嫁後還有她自已，因為太記得自己，就不成個賢妻良母。——所以女人多了一個姓之後，多半就失去了個性。親民  調鸚　　做一個刋物的編輯，有時是會感到生活非常乏味的。　　好萊塢的電影明星湯麥斯·密契爾，本來就是一個編輯，他編輯的刋物叫做「木橋週刋」。在一九一三年的一天，他覺得無聊已極，就到紐澤西州海邊的沙灘上去蹓躂蹓　。他檢起了一只海蚌，把牠放在沙上，看牠會不會走回海邊去。他坐在沙上，靜靜看着。　　忽然沙地上傳來脚聲，有人問他在幹什麼。但密契爾懶得抬起頭來，祗「哼」了一聲。　　那個人在他前面蹲了下來。　　大家不聲不響了好久。那個人說：「這樣一個懶惰的傢伙倒是第一次看見。一　　隔了一會，密契爾說，「不錯。　　兩個人陰陽怪氣地談起來，那個人不耐煩了，就學着密契爾那種懶洋洋的聲調說話。但是密契爾還是頭也不肯抬起來看一看他。最後，那個人問密契爾：「你在那裹做事？」　　密契爾慢吞吞地說，「在木橋鎭。編雜誌。你呢？」　　那個人說：「從前在普林斯登大學混了一陣。現在倒總算找到了一个好差使了。我算是總統。」　　密契爾實在忍不住了，抬起頭來看時，前面果然是笑容可掬的威爾遜！　　鈔之一「次」再一大」，影響物價之外，其本身亦失去「易中」之標準價値，而實物及現貨乃取而代之，亦勢有必至，理有固然。　　房租論「麵」風氣，流行已久，官方禁止數次，漸成具文。人謂「吃瓦片的」心狠手辣（北人謂收房租為生者曰吃瓦片）市儈習氣，但教育界是知識階級，而私立中小學費「要麵！」亦成公開之秘密，則市儈不足責矣。小學每期至少一袋，中學則三袋，此為極普通者。若東城之某某教會學校，中學每學期要八袋之多，則其他之只須三四袋者，相形之下，且不失為「價廉」矣。（然教會學校取費雖重，投考者郤較為踴躍，此種心理，可與大學之燕京·輔仁號召力强於其他之私大相參證。）　　「收學費」與「收房租」同取「拜麵主義」，事固近俗，亦無足怪。一則「要麵」可以减少大數目字之刺激，因一個中學一學期的學費「要幾萬萬！」雖合之麵價，亦可諒解，而未免多費唇舌，不如索興「要麺！」即寓解釋於其中，而又非常實惠，乃一舉兩得之法。（教會中學在事變之前，每期學費二十餘元，亦合彼時八袋麵之價。）二則實物標準已為公私上下共同之趨向，收錢糧旣已徵實，公務員對於實物配給（麵布油鹽等）之堅持，亦比鈔數調整更為熱烈。至於洋車夫之討價，開口二三十萬，亦即繼之以「雜麵一斤」之比例，已是不約而同之口頭嘽。　　舊時所謂「拜金主義」，今當易為「拜麵主義」（江南或是「拜米」主義？）因食糧之漲，雖金鈔亦當自愧不如。其次乃是「拜金」，此金則為黃金，為美金（亦鈔也而有金之用），為「白金」（銀也，圓形者尤合需要）。至於國產之「楮金」，雖流通照常，大都表示不「拜」之態度。</p>

<h3>China, the United States, and Britain to Take United Action: Simultaneously Recognize the Republic of Korea; Jointly Strive for Prosperity and Stability in the Orient</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Bureau, 3rd] It is reported that China, the United States, and Britain will adopt a unified approach to simultaneously recognize the newly established Republic of Korea, which was founded on a constitutional basis. Since the general election held in Korea under the supervision of the United Nations, the three countries have been exchanging opinions. Now, the Korean National Assembly has agreed to President Syngman Rhee's nomination of General Lee Bum Suk as the first Prime Minister. The first cabinet will also be formed in the near future. Formal recognition by the three countries is not far off. After being recognized by the major Allied powers, Korea will be able to receive political power from the US military and regain its independent autonomy, which it lost more than 50 years ago. Following the December 1945 Moscow Conference, the Three Foreign Ministers Conference decided on a five-year trusteeship for Korea by the four powers. However, the Korean people and revolutionary leaders expressed their opposition. Despite the passage of years, no further agreement was reached between the countries, and the situation in Korea deteriorated under the occupation by the US and Soviet armies. Last April, Foreign Minister Wang of our country sent a letter to Marshall, advocating that Korea should gain independence as soon as possible and suggesting that if the occupying countries could not reach an agreement, China, the US, Britain, and the Soviet Union should conduct rapid and comprehensive consultations. Subsequently, the Korean issue was brought before the United Nations. After many twists and turns, the United Nations Commission, disregarding the opposition of the Soviet Union, assisted in the establishment of a democratic Korea, resulting in the situation today. Korea is a brotherly country to ours. Throughout its struggle for independence, our country has always provided support. Now that it has finally succeeded, it is not only the realization of the will of the Korean people but also the fulfillment of a long-cherished wish of our entire nation. People from all walks of life in the capital believe that China and Korea will live in permanent peace, jointly solve their own problems, and work together for the prosperity and stability of the Orient.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Bureau, 3rd] Upon hearing that Lee Bum Suk had been appointed as the first Prime Minister of Korea by President Syngman Rhee, Minister of Education Chu Chia-hua sent a telegram of congratulations on the 3rd. The message read: "Delighted to learn of your esteemed appointment as the first Prime Minister after your nation's restoration. All admire your brilliance. It is gratifying beyond measure. Not only can the unification of your country be expected soon, but the friendship between China and Korea will also be further strengthened, making more contributions to promoting peace in East Asia and the world. I send this telegram to express my congratulations. I hope you will take note of it."</p>
<h3>Kuomintang Officials' Symposium: Broadly Reviewing Party Affairs; Reform and the Retention or Abolition of Factions as the Focus of Discussion; The President to Attend Today and Give Instructions</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Bureau, 3rd] The Kuomintang Party Affairs Symposium was held at the National Assembly Hall on the morning of the 3rd at 9:00 AM. More than 400 people attended, including members of the Central Committee, heads of various departments of the Central Party Headquarters, and Kuomintang members of the Legislative Yuan and Control Yuan. Ju Zheng presided over the meeting. The main purpose of convening the meeting was to review current party affairs. Therefore, the entire day's meeting was devoted to attendees expressing their opinions extensively. It lasted from 9:00 AM to 12:00 PM in the morning and from 4:00 PM to 7:00 PM in the afternoon. More than 30 people spoke. The meeting is scheduled to continue on the 4th. After the attendees have finished speaking, the Secretary-General will summarize the opinions or elect a representative to be responsible for the summary. The summary will then be submitted to the Central Standing Committee for discussion and research as the basis for reforming party affairs. Speakers were very enthusiastic at today's meeting, and they put forward many heated opinions. According to sources, the focus of today's speeches included the following points: (1) Party affairs must be reformed; this is a definite and unshakeable principle. As for the system of reform, some people believe that it can be improved according to the current situation, while others advocate for a complete reform. (2) Regarding factions, some people advocate that they should be abolished, some advocate that factions should still be retained, some advocate that the Central Party Headquarters should exercise unified command, and some advocate that the democratic centralism system should still be adopted, with the final decision-making power granted to the President. (3) The party should be reformed simultaneously with the economy and military. (4) The party's reform should be adapted to the constitution and should make good use of the constitution. (5) The party must seek the welfare of the majority of people, etc. The reasons they gave for the reform were that the current party affairs were not progressive and were corrupt and backward. If they did not catch up quickly, the future course of events would be unimaginable. Regarding the faction issue, some advocated that they should still be allowed to exist and that they should be allowed to form their own organizations separately. Others advocated that factions must withdraw from the Party Headquarters. Someone said that the unsound personnel system within the party was the phenomenon that formed factions. The two points above were the most important focus of today's review meeting. Some also touched on issues such as the personnel system. However, the issues that were discussed the longest were still: (1) Reform is a necessary task, and (2) The faction's survival question. The meeting will continue for another day on the 4th. More than 40 people, including Sun Yulin, Yu Peihou, and Cheng Tianfang, spoke today. Wu Zhongxin presided over this afternoon's meeting.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Bureau, 3rd] It has been decided that the President will attend the Kuomintang Party Affairs Symposium on the afternoon of the 4th to give instructions. Furthermore, there are many opinions on reforming party affairs in the symposium, all of which will be submitted to the Central Standing Committee for discussion and research in the future.</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>How Will the Kuomintang Reform?</h3>
<p>The Kuomintang's reform movement has been brewing for a long time, and now it has gradually moved from shouting slogans and propaganda to concrete implementation. The Kuomintang Party Affairs Symposium opened in Nanjing yesterday. It is heard that there will be two days of meetings to discuss the plan for improving party affairs. In addition to the Central Executive and Supervisory Committee members remaining in Nanjing and the Kuomintang's elected Legislative and Supervisory Committee members, the heads of various ministries and commissions who are members of the Kuomintang will also participate in the discussions. It can truly be called a grand gathering of the Kuomintang. Although this is only a symposium, it may not have a decisive effect. However, if there are any resolutions, they may serve as the basis for future discussions at the Central Plenary Session. At this critical moment when the nation's survival and the revolution's success or failure are at stake, the Kuomintang's self-examination of party affairs to seek improvement is a welcome phenomenon, both for the Kuomintang itself and for the influence on our nation and people. However, the most important thing is that we must know that it is not about discussion but about implementation, not about merely arguing with words and criticizing each other, but about each aspect and each committee member thoroughly reflecting on themselves and using actions to first reform themselves, in order to gain the trust of the people.</p>
<p>The Chinese Kuomintang is originally incomparable to ordinary political parties. In terms of history, it is a political party with more than fifty years of revolutionary history, and it has actually held political power for twenty years. In the first half of the revolution, it led the Chinese people in revolution, overthrew the Qing Dynasty, and founded the Republic of China; it defeated the warlords and unified the country. During the War of Resistance, the Kuomintang led the military and civilians of the country in a difficult war of resistance, defeated the violent Japanese, abolished all unequal treaties, and jumped to become one of the five strongest countries in the post-war world. In all fairness, the Kuomintang has made unparalleled contributions to the country. With such a history, it should be indelible in the hearts of the people forever, and the people will always remember it. In terms of doctrine and political program, the Kuomintang believes in Dr. Sun Yat-sen's teachings and implements the Three Principles of the People, which are not only needed by China at present, but also needed by China in the future. All patriotic and upright citizens, even if they have not joined the Kuomintang, mostly believe in the Three Principles of the People, believing that they are most suitable for the national conditions. They still hold hope for the Kuomintang and yearn for the emergence of a new China under the Three Principles of the People. But why does there seem to be a wave of criticism of the Kuomintang spreading in society today, as if the Kuomintang has committed some major crime against the nation and people? Indeed, when a political party has been in power for too long, the people inevitably become tired of it, just like the situation of the Conservative Party in Britain after the war. However, if the Kuomintang itself is still a vigorous, energetic, loyal to its doctrine, unyielding, and confident political party, then with millions of party members who are united in their hearts and minds, relying on decades of revolutionary struggle experience, it should be able to cope with this difficult and great era and never be at a loss, like a lamb waiting to be slaughtered.</p>
<p>To be honest, the Chinese people seem to have reduced their hopes for the Kuomintang now, and the Kuomintang's glorious history seems dim at present. The Kuomintang members naturally feel infinite pain and regret, and the Chinese people also feel that it is a loss to the country? However, for a glorious revolutionary political party to be reduced to such a state, the Kuomintang must deeply reflect on itself and take responsibility. Now that the Kuomintang is holding a Party Affairs Symposium, if it still cannot examine the root cause of the Kuomintang's illness, prescribe the right medicine, and enable the Kuomintang to be reborn, then today's Kuomintang members will not be able to shoulder the country's burden, and they will also be ashamed of Dr. Sun Yat-sen's spirit in heaven!</p>
<p>Where is the root cause of the Kuomintang's ills? It is that it is old and complacent! The only way to cure the disease of being old and complacent is "newness." "Zhou, the old state, its mandate is new"; "If you can one day renovate yourself, do so from day to day, and again from day to day," these are all maxims that teach us to strive for newness. So how will the Kuomintang reform? This is indeed not a simple question, and opinions differ. At yesterday's meeting, it was heard that some people advocated forming a separate "Independent Communist Party," which would be surprisingly "new"! If the Kuomintang were to reform in this way, it would seem as if it were competing with the Chinese Communist Party for the orthodoxy of communism, which would be a great joke. According to reports, the party's top leaders have also held meetings repeatedly to discuss reform plans. The questions raised include: (1) simplification or reorganization of party organs; (2) unification or dualization of party affairs organizations; and (3) bottom-up or top-down party system. In fact, from our point of view, if the reform of party affairs is still examined in this way, the result may be equal to zero! These are merely tricks in form and cannot save the Kuomintang from its chronic illness. Standing in the position of protecting the Kuomintang, we would also like to offer two opinions. Whether they are unpleasant to hear is something we cannot worry about.</p>
<p>First, the Kuomintang is an organic body and must understand the role of "metabolism" to maintain the spirit of "daily renewal." Because the Kuomintang has fifty years of revolutionary history and has been in power for more than twenty years, it is now not only a huge organization with numerous members, seemingly becoming a "party of all the people," but also, in these twenty years, countless corrupt and evil elements have infiltrated it one after another. Everything is done in the name of the "party," but in fact, the "party" has never been able to restrain them. In addition, the lack of the organic function of "metabolism" has made it like a pool of stagnant water, harboring dirt and filth, so that fragrant and foul odors are mixed together. For ten years, there has been a stench, and people only see a part of the corrupt and deteriorating party members, forgetting the countless martyrs who shed blood and sacrificed themselves and the many struggling people who endured hardships and acted independently. At the same time, a successful party often maintains its current state, only knowing how to continue the status quo and being unable to come up with a new style of work. It is even more unable to make the decision of a strong man cutting off his wrist, so it allows the atmosphere of corruption and decline to gradually spread without making any efforts to save it. In addition, within the party, factions are divided, and outside the party, people are instigated to create discord. Cunning people use their intelligence and talent to 横行于其中. If the reform of party affairs in the future cannot deeply "blame oneself" and thoroughly clarify the situation, then the corrupt dregs will still remain, and the worthy people in the party will still be buried. There will be no way for metabolism to take place, and how can vitality be restored? Examining it for a year and a half will inevitably be of no use!</p>
<p>Second, since the Kuomintang is a revolutionary political party, all Kuomintang members should come for revolutionary aspirations, and the first meaning of a revolutionary is self-sacrifice! Those who do not have this revolutionary spirit of self-sacrifice should not be tolerated by the Kuomintang in the future. It must be understood that the revolutionary spirit is not the spirit shown by some people who are merely "self-proclaimed advanced and criticize at will," but the self-sacrificing spirit of burying oneself in hard work and not seeking fame. The spirit of the revolutionary predecessors during the Xinhai Revolution and the Huanghuagang Uprising is the best medicine for the Kuomintang to treat its root causes in the future. In the past, a glorious history of the Kuomintang was written with the blood of revolutionary martyrs! Now that the Kuomintang is facing unprecedented difficulties, Kuomintang members should have the ambition to sacrifice themselves for the party and the country with a great spirit, and should not only scold people loudly within the party, never blaming themselves, secretly vying for power, and never giving in. Otherwise, the wish to save the party may not be fulfilled, and the party and the country may perish together! The Kuomintang's big problem today is not that there are too many party members, but that there are too few party members with a revolutionary spirit. It is not that party members do not talk about revolution, but that party members only talk about revolution and forget that each person must first revolutionize their own heart! We believe that all selfish and self-interested people, regardless of whether they want to use the Kuomintang as a stepping stone to advancement or use the Kuomintang to seek fame and reputation, the Kuomintang should resolutely and decisively no longer allow them to stay in the party and become a fermenting agent for the continued corruption of the Kuomintang! Only in this way can the Kuomintang extricate itself, and only then can the Kuomintang authorities truly start anew with the people.</p>

<h3>Capital Police Chief Reports on Public Security: Clearing Bandit Underground Organizations; Striving to Eliminate the Impact of Rising Prices on Society</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 3rd] Huang Zhenwu, Chief of the Capital Police Department, hosted a meeting with journalists in Nanjing on the evening of the 3rd to report on the recent state of public security in the capital. He first stated that since taking office last December, he had strengthened winter defense arrangements, and fortunately, no accidents had occurred. Later, as the National Assembly and the Legislative and Supervisory Yuan successively convened, the communists publicly declared that they would obstruct the implementation of the constitution and conspired to incite student movements and labor unrest, creating bloodshed in an attempt to confuse domestic and foreign audiences. Fortunately, the citizens of the capital understood the righteousness and were not deceived. Police officers maintained close vigilance day and night, and ultimately, they passed peacefully. Huang also pointed out that the current rising prices and the increasing difficulty of making a living have a profound impact on social security. The Police Department has a responsibility to strive to eliminate the situation. To this end, he described in detail the recent cracking of a shocking theft case, the arrest of Wang Shoujin, a "Macau" expert who had been active in the northern district for two months, specializing in stealing from the residences of diplomatic missions and senior government officials. According to the police officer in charge of the case, the case cost as much as 2 billion, but the recovered stolen goods are estimated to be worth hundreds of billions. Subsequently, Huang emphasized that thieves only affect public security, causing residents to suffer financial losses. However, the lurking, espionage, sabotage, and insidious tricks of the communists are even more terrifying. He announced news that is still unknown to the public, saying that around the time of the National Assembly, the police had discovered a fire-setting team sent by the communists to Nanjing, and also cracked the location where they transported bullets. The case of the secret bandit organization hidden in Sanwenhe in the western suburbs of Nanjing, which was cracked in early July, has conclusive evidence and is currently being tried by the Special Criminal Court. He believes that other underground organizations of bandits that [missing character] been cracked will be cleared one after another, and hopes to obtain assistance from all parties in the overall battle against the full-scale rebellion of the communists, so that the bandits cannot hide and their conspiracies and insidious plans cannot be carried out.</p>

<h3>Three Envoys Meet Stalin</h3>
<h3>Each Reports to Their National Government</h3>
<h3>Content of Talks Temporarily Undisclosed</h3>
<p>[United Press Moscow dispatch] Signs of a swift resolution to the German problem emerged. After a two-hour meeting with Premier Stalin at the Kremlin at 9 PM on the 2nd, the envoys of the United States, Britain, and France left with smiles. Moscow observers believe that discussions with Stalin or Molotov will continue. Molotov also attended the historical meeting on the 2nd. After the meeting, the three envoys went to the US Embassy, joined by British Chargé d'Affaires Harrison and US Chargé d'Affaires Kohler, to jointly review the results of the meeting. The representatives of the three countries then reported the details of the meeting to their respective governments, refusing to disclose the contents to the press. The next meeting will depend on their government's reaction to this meeting and their instructions.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse London dispatch] The British Foreign Office confirmed this morning that it had received a report from the British representative, Roberts, stating that he had met with Stalin last night. According to sources at the British Foreign Office, the three representatives were received by Stalin separately, with US Ambassador Smith first, followed by British special envoy Roberts, and finally French Ambassador Chataigneau. A spokesman for the British Foreign Office declined to comment, stating only that the Foreign Office was reviewing the report received from Moscow.</p>
<p>[United Press Washington dispatch] The State Department received a report on the 3rd from US Ambassador to the Soviet Union Smith regarding the meeting between the Western envoys and Stalin. State Department News Officer McDermott stated, "We have received Ambassador Smith's report." When asked for details, McDermott replied, "That's all we can say, we have no content to share." The report was immediately studied by Secretary of State Marshall, Under Secretary of State Lovett, and other officials. There is still no indication when the details will be released.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency Berlin dispatch] According to well-informed Soviet sources, if Western countries resolutely implement the plan to establish a West German government, the Soviet authorities will not back down. Regarding the two-hour meeting between Stalin and the Western envoys to the Soviet Union, the Soviet sources stated that the only possible topic for discussion under the current circumstances may be the issue of the peaceful withdrawal of Western troops from Berlin.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse London dispatch] The authorities remained silent on the meeting between the special envoys of the three Western powers and Stalin in Moscow. However, British politicians expect that if today's meeting yields results, it could pave the way for a reconvening of the Four Power Foreign Ministers Conference, and even in the next stage, it is possible that US President Truman, British Prime Minister Attlee, and French Premier Marie will meet with Stalin in person to negotiate. The agenda of this meeting will extend beyond the scope of the Berlin issue and may address the various issues on which the Soviet Union and the three Western powers have disagreed for months. Apart from semi-official speculations, the specific instructions given by the governments of Britain, the United States, and France to their envoys in Moscow have not been disclosed to date. The three governments are deeply concerned about harming the outcome of the negotiations, hence their tight-lipped approach.</p>
<h3>Berlin Police Force Splintered</h3>
<h3>Soviet-Zone Police Chief Illegally Arrests People</h3>
<p>[United Press Berlin dispatch] The East-West dispute has erupted again in Berlin, and the Berlin police force has split.

After being dismissed by the city government, Markgraf refused to hand over his post, leading to the split in the Berlin police force. Stumm's headquarters has been moved to the American sector. When the four police officers were dispatched to the old headquarters to retrieve files, Markgraf ordered their arrest.

<h3>Fighting for Navigation Rights on the Danube River</h3>
<h3>Britain Expresses No Fear of Threats</h3>
<h3>Ambassador Baker Responds to Soviet Accusations</h3>
<p>[This report] London Broadcasting Belgrade dispatch on the 3rd: British Ambassador Baker, who attended the Danube River Conference, responded to Vyshinsky's remarks last Saturday, saying, "During the conference, I will never succumb to any coercion or intimidation. The British delegation will not be provoked by Vyshinsky's attacks. In other words, the so-called ultimatum-like final demand does not exist in my mind. Regarding Vyshinsky's accusation that Western countries are imperialists, Baker replied, "If the majority of countries control inland river shipping and transport materials from other countries, is this not imperialism?"</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse Belgrade dispatch on the 2nd] The new draft Danube River Convention proposed by the Soviet Union strongly emphasizes the "principle of free navigation on the Danube River, without prejudice to the interests and sovereignty of the Danube River countries." It also suggests that the new Danube River Committee's headquarters should be located in Romania's Galati. An administrative body composed of both the Soviet Union and Romania should be established in the "Iron Gate" area. The 1921 Danube River Convention should be abolished.</p>
<p>[US Information Service Washington dispatch on the 2nd] The State Department issued a statement to the press today, stating that the "insistence" of the Soviet Union and other Eastern European countries at the Danube River Conference on excluding English from being used as an "official" language is detrimental to the progress of the conference. The statement said, "The eyes of the world are focused on this conference, and this apparent predetermination to pass this resolution will create an unfortunate impression." It is rumored that Vyshinsky presented a document on Saturday that was practically equivalent to an ultimatum, demanding that participating countries accept the Eastern European countries' plan for the Danube River. When asked what stance the United States would take on this matter, a State Department spokesman replied that the US stance would be explained by the US Ambassador to Yugoslavia and head of the US delegation to the Danube River Conference, Kennan.</p>

<h3>Hundreds of American Communist Spies</h3>
<h3>Still Working for the Soviet Union</h3>
<h3>Accusation by Former US Communist Leader Burton</h3>
<p>[United Press Washington dispatch on the 2nd] Former US Communist leader Burton accused on the 2nd that "there are currently hundreds of Communist Party members serving in the federal government as spies for the Soviet Union" and are still working. Burton, who was the leader of the US Communist Party for ten years, left the party in 1945. He also said that the film industry is a major base for supporting Communist activities.</p>
<p>At the same time, Monte Hall, the acting chairman of the House Un-American Activities Committee, announced that Seiffert Masters, a former official of the Department of Commerce, had been ordered to appear before the committee to answer the accusation that he led a Soviet spy organization during the war. Hall added that Miss Bentley, who had once been a Communist agent, had listed Seiffert and more than 30 other federal employees as members of the spy organization last week. They will be allowed to appear to defend themselves if they wish. Hall continued that the committee believes it now has enough evidence to initiate criminal proceedings immediately. He also said that the committee may ask Attorney General Clark to initiate a grand jury investigation into espionage and Communist activities within the government. Bentley's testimony has been extensively supported by Burton. Burton testified that the American Communist Party is full of organizations conducting military and diplomatic espionage for the Soviet Union. Burton also said that he knew the names of US government officials who supplied intelligence to the Soviet Union, as he had been a member of the Communist Political Committee and had worked with several spy organizations.</p>
<h3>Communist Elements in the US State Department Have Been Eliminated</h3>
<p>Congressman Johnkman tells Congress</p>
<p>[Central News Agency Washington dispatch on the 2nd] At a time when the government agencies here are shrouded in suspicion due to the Soviet "spy network" case, the report released today by Republican Congressman Johnkman is tantamount to issuing a clean bill of health to the State Department.

<h3>Japanese Cabinet on the Verge of Collapse: Ashida Under Fire for Anti-Strike Bill; Dissolution of Parliament Unavoidable in September/October</h3>
<p>[United Press, Tokyo, 3rd] The Ashida cabinet, under attack for its ordinance banning strikes by civil servants, is teetering on the brink of collapse today. Japanese observers suggest that unless the Allied Headquarters provides immediate support, the cabinet will fall.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 3rd] Significant political changes are inevitable in Japan within the next three months. The dissolution of the current parliament seems unavoidable during the special session scheduled for September/October. According to Japanese observers, Prime Minister Ashida is gradually shifting from his original stance on the matter due to the insistence of Tetsu Katayama, the chairman of the Social Democratic Party, on dissolving the parliament. They also point out that the Democratic Party's reshuffling of personnel on the 2nd was an effort to strengthen the party in preparation for the general election after the parliament's dissolution.</p>
<p>Another fact that strongly suggests the parliament will inevitably be dissolved is the emergence of cracks within the Social Democratic Party, which has been the strongest supporter of the Ashida cabinet. Although Labor Minister Kanjū Katō and Interior Minister Masaru Yosomizo, both left-wing figures in the Socialist Party, are willing to remain in the current cabinet until a concrete decision is made on the revision of the Civil Service Law, which is causing much public debate, other left-wing members of the party have harshly criticized the Ashida cabinet, accusing it of "misinterpreting" the Allied Headquarters' letter. Furthermore, the fact that party chairman Tetsu Katayama insisted on dissolving the parliament, disregarding the advice of most right-wing members, suggests that his own position has slightly shifted to the left. Additionally, left-wing members of the Social Democratic Party have issued a statement criticizing the government, stating that the prohibition of collective bargaining and strikes by civil servants violates the sixteen principles of the Far Eastern Commission and accusing the government of deliberately exaggerating MacArthur's letter to avoid its own responsibility. If the current parliament is indeed dissolved, the next general election will inevitably produce a more conservative cabinet.</p>
<p>[New Asia News Agency, Tokyo, 3rd] After the Japanese government passed the outline of the National Public Service Law amendment at today's cabinet meeting, there will be a considerable period of recess. All cabinet members (including Prime Minister Ashida) will travel to various locations to give political speeches. It is reported that a temporary cabinet meeting is scheduled to be convened again on the 18th of this month to discuss the draft amendment to the Public Service Law.</p>
<h3>Roster of Korean Cabinet Members: Democratic Party Holds Majority; Four Ministers of Finance, Transportation, etc. Announced</h3>

<h3>National Bank Only Willing to Lend Limited Funds for Public Utility Oil and Coal Foreign Exchange: Senators Express Dissatisfaction with New Public Utility Prices; Subcommittee to Propose Emergency Motion to Oppose</h3>
<p>In order to solve the difficulties of public utilities and reduce their costs, the municipal government previously decided to request a loan from the National Bank for the foreign exchange needed for one month's worth of oil and coal, so that the prices of oil and coal in the cost of public utilities would not fluctuate for one month. The original loan target was 10 trillion, but after the Public Utilities Bureau finalized negotiations with the National Bank the other day, it was only willing to lend 3.5 trillion, and it must be repaid in the short term, which is a far cry from the amount requested. The Central Bank also stated that "this will not be an example in the future."</p>
<p>Since the announcement of the new prices for public utilities in this city, salaried workers have felt overwhelmed, while the companies still think that the prices have not been raised enough, believing that the authorities are overly suppressing them. According to senators Yu Shunjiang, Hao, and others, who were responsible for investigating the accounts of companies as part of the former Public Utilities Investigation Committee of the Municipal Senate, companies such as Shanghai Power Company and Telephone Company often claim to be suffering losses, but if we analyze them, there are many unreasonable aspects. First, the salary and allowance item in their expenses is particularly large, especially for foreign personnel. Not only are their base salaries quite high, with monthly payments of thousands of US dollars, but they are even calculated at the black market rate. As a result, it is common for senior personnel to receive hundreds of billions of legal tender per month. As the black market gold certificate rises, salaries increase accordingly, and the company's expenses become even larger, but what the citizens use is legal tender. Second, the government sometimes gives preferential treatment for the foreign exchange needed by the companies for materials, such as one-time foreign exchange settlements or loans, but the companies do not seem to take this into consideration in their accounting.</p>
<p>Senators Zhang Zhongyuan, Zhuang Ping, Fei Shusheng and others, due to the excessively high price increases of public utilities, will propose an emergency motion at the Public Utilities Subcommittee meeting to be held by the Senate in the coming days to unanimously oppose it.</p>
<h3>Air Freight Adjustment: Increase of 34% Effective Today</h3>

<h3>Mayor Wu Visited the Suburbs Yesterday Morning: Gave a Speech to Over a Thousand Refugee Children; "Mayor" Makes a Request to the Mayor; Hopes to Increase Funding for Malnutrition</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper] At 9:00 AM yesterday morning, Mayor Wu, at the invitation of the Shanghai Municipal China Children's Education Center in Caohejing, visited the center with Zhang Peter, the head of the Social Affairs Section, and gave a speech to 1,500 refugee children. The Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer film company sent photographer Wang Xiaoting to capture the scene, which will become part of the "Life of Chinese Children" film.</p>
<p>The Mayor, wearing a beige striped gabardine suit and yellow openwork leather shoes, was greeted with applause by thousands of children when he arrived at the center. He was then led by Cai Zhongde, the children's mayor, and the heads of various bureaus to meet Mayor Wu. After the two mayors met, "Mayor" Cai made three requests: (1) The center's daily expenses for each child are only 30,000 legal tender, which is not enough to buy a sesame cake. Therefore, all the children are pale and thin and malnourished. It is hoped that funding can be increased. (2) The children are growing up and need specialized skills to gain a foothold in society. It is hoped that Mayor Wu can enrich the center's vocational education equipment, such as typewriters, sewing machines, and automobiles, to facilitate learning. (3) In the past six months, the center has taken in 600 homeless children. It is requested that teachers and desks and chairs be increased to facilitate teaching. Mayor Wu immediately replied: (1 and 2) Because a lot of money is needed for these two points, the city government's treasury is empty and it cannot provide subsidies. It is currently planned to sell the ship donated by Wang Zhongying, which is estimated to be worth about 100,000 US dollars. After the sale, it will be decided to donate half to the center. Regarding the third point, Mayor Wu immediately approved it and submitted it to the Municipal Education Bureau, approving the addition of six classes and the purchase of 350 sets of desks and chairs. Then, he went to the square and gave a speech to 1,500 children. The children were all wearing white undershirts with horizontal black stripes, white cloth shorts, and white hats. Although they stood upright under the scorching sun, their spirits were high, but it was difficult to hide their malnourished and haggard faces.

<h3>Fire at Huzhou Guildhall: Four Funeral Homes Destroyed; Bones Suffer</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper] The Huzhou Guildhall at No. 828 Zhongyu Road in Zhabei suddenly caught fire at around 9:00 PM last night. For a time, the fire was out of control. Later, the Shenjiawan Fire Brigade of the Zhabei 123 Section Fire Department and the Baoyu Road Fire Department, etc., rushed to the scene with pump trucks to provide assistance. Unfortunately, there was a lack of tap water nearby. It was not until leather belts were connected from Yongxing Road and Huiwen Road, as many as 40, that water was obtained for injection. After the firefighters worked hard to put out the fire, the fire was brought under control at about 10:30. As a result, four funeral homes and a large number of coffins were burned, so the stench spread everywhere during the burning, which was nauseating. As for the cause of the fire, it is said to have been caused by carelessness during a Taoist ritual.</p>
<h3>Bird in a Gilded Cage: Disappointed Person in Love; Miserable Shanghai Miss; Xie Jia-hua Saved After Attempting Suicide by Poisoning</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper] Xie Jia-hua, the "Shanghai Miss" who made a name for herself in Hong Kong last year with the Repulse Bay incident, had reconciled with her husband, Rong Meihua, after returning to Shanghai thanks to the mediation of relatives and friends. However, in the past six months, Rong has never kept his promise, strictly controlling Xie's actions and refusing to break off his relationship with his mistress surnamed Zhang. Xie, feeling bored and lonely, depressed, and thinking that she had met an unworthy man, developed the idea of ending her life. On the night of the 24th of last month, she suddenly took sleeping pills to commit suicide. Fortunately, she was rescued quickly and was not in danger. She was then hospitalized for a week and was only discharged yesterday.</p>
<p>According to Xie, Rong had two women before marrying her, but both had divorced him, leaving eight children. Since Xie returned to her husband's home, Rong has ordered her to cut off all social interactions and raise the children. Xie deeply resents that she cannot act freely and often said angrily to Rong: "If I had known that you needed a housekeeper, why did you pursue me in the first place!" Rong tried his best to express that it was only because he deeply loved her that he did this. However, Rong often did not return home all night. After Xie learned that he was still living with his mistress surnamed Zhang in his self-built house on Fulu Road, she urged him to complete the divorce formalities as soon as possible. Rong claimed that the mistress's demands for divorce were too harsh and asked Xie: "If you really love me, how can you bear to make me bankrupt because of this matter?" Seeing that nothing could be done, Xie was resentful and had this act.</p>
<p>Suffering from Mental Illness; Taking Medicine to Sleep</p>
<p>Since Xie had a falling out with Rong last year, she has often felt mentally disturbed. Moreover, due to the above reasons, she developed a disease due to depression. Doctors often advised her to take sleeping pills, so Xie had accumulated as many as nine sleeping pills. At 11:00 PM on the night of the 24th, Xie waited for Rong but he did not arrive. Her heart was aching, and she swallowed all the pills in a daze. When Rong heard the news and rushed home, he stamped his feet at Xie and said: "How can you ask me to live?" Recently, after Xie was discharged from the hospital, she believed that Rong still lacked sincerity and that the relationship between the two could no longer be maintained, and she resolutely demanded a divorce.</p>
<p>Concerned About Face; Refuses Divorce</p>
<p>However, Rong firmly refused to divorce because of his status, career, and face. Xie's family, in view of Rong's making light promises, stated that if he wanted to profess his love again, he must provide a valid guarantee and issue a written statement. However, Rong argued: "Marriage can be written in a contract, and divorce can also be written in a contract. How can a contract be written in the middle?" Xie, having taken medicine, looked haggard and weak, and with tears in her eyes, she repeatedly said that she was busy with the "election" the year before last, filming a movie last year, and the heroic spirit was like yesterday. Who would have thought that after finding a home, she would be subjected to all kinds of torment? She said that she already felt bored with the ups and downs of this world.</p>

<h3>Over 300 Warehouses: Surprise Inspection Launched, Seven Units Explain Reasons, Social Affairs Bureau to Review Again</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Report] The Social Affairs Bureau, in order to curb and stabilize commodity prices and crack down on hoarding, launched a warehouse inspection in the city. It had previously completed inspections of 32 warehouses that had failed to report on time.

<h3>Director Zhou Talks About the Situation at the Reformatory</h3>
<p>Afterwards, a reporter interviewed Director Zhou about the situation at the reformatory. According to Director Zhou, the reformatory occupies 105 mu (approximately 17.3 acres) and currently houses 2,500 children in need. The 1,500 children who attended the hearing today are the more orderly ones. Among them, there are 220 female children in need. The oldest is 16 years old, and the youngest is 6 years old. Most of them are petty thieves, gamblers, or even drug addicts. Most of the female children were abducted and intended to be sold as prostitutes but were discovered by the police and sent here. Currently, the reformatory consumes more than 12 shi (approximately 1.44 tons) of rice every day. The reformatory's monthly income is only 1.5 billion (currency unit unspecified), while its expenditures reach 4.2 billion (currency unit unspecified). The shortfall is made up by generous donations from various parties. The survival and development of the reformatory in the future will still rely on the support and assistance of enthusiastic people from all walks of life. As for the children's future prospects, vocational education will be strengthened, such as waiter training, to meet the needs of various parties. In terms of management, the principle of encouraging children's self-governance is adopted. The reformatory has a "city government," a "council," a "post office," a "bank," and a "library," all of which are staffed by the children themselves to cultivate their self-governance abilities.</p>
<h3>Forming a Gang to Extort, Kidnapping a Woman for Ransom, Box Cannon Found in Cathay Hotel, Five Criminals Arrested in Succession</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Report] Zheng Yaoshan, 49, from Qingpu, resides at No. 9 Dingyu Li, Weining Road, in western Shanghai. He has two children: his eldest daughter, Huizhen, 22, works as a factory worker at the Zhongfang Textile Factory on Changshou Road, and his son, Bingquan, 20, suffers from a mental illness and is currently recuperating at the Anchasi Temple in Malu Township, Jiading County. Ge Yong learned that the Zheng family had some savings and became covetous. A few days ago, he colluded with Guo Maoheng (27, from Hubei), a guard platoon leader from a certain military organization in Nanhui, and five ruffians, Xu Qiufeng, Shi Zhengguo, and Wang Zhengxing, falsely accusing Zheng of hiding firearms. When their extortion of 40 dan (approximately 4.8 tons) of rice failed, they forcibly abducted Zheng's daughter, Huizhen, and took her to Room 103 of the Cathay Hotel on Yunnan South Road, while urging Zheng to pay the ransom. The next day, Zheng reported the information to the Songshan Police Sub-Bureau. Chief Chen ordered Chen Kaizhou, the chief of the Criminal Investigation Section, to lead officers Chen Linshu, Tan Yangsheng, Lu Ziyu, Deng Kexiang, and others to rush to the Cathay Hotel. They arrested Guo Maoheng and confiscated a box cannon and 20 bullets. Afterwards, they sent officers to wait in ambush and arrested Xu Qiufeng.

<h3>General Answers to Questions Regarding Applications for Student Aid: What Conditions Must Be Met? How to Apply? How Much Can Be Obtained?</h3>
<p>In the past month, the newspaper's Student Aid Fund Committee has received numerous letters and telegrams from impoverished students at all levels of schools throughout the city, as well as inquiries from relatives and friends who have come to the office in person to ask about the autumn student aid. In addition to having responded separately, we are deeply concerned that many people outside the committee may still be unclear about the content of the aid. Therefore, we have compiled all the questions and prepared a general answer as follows:</p>
<p>(1) What conditions must students meet in order to apply for student aid?</p>
<p>[Answer] Applicants must meet the following conditions: (A) be from an impoverished family; (B) have pure character and sound physique; (C) have excellent academic performance, with an average grade in the top one-third, or have special expertise that is worthy of further study; and (D) have not received free education or other types of aid from the school.</p>
<p>(2) What types of schools must be attended in order to apply for student aid?</p>
<p>[Answer] Applications are open to all students attending registered private junior high schools, senior high schools, universities, and vocational schools. Public, municipal, provincial, and national schools are not eligible.</p>
<p>(3) When will application forms be available?</p>
<p>[Answer] They will be issued separately when school starts: early September for junior and senior high schools, and mid-September for universities and vocational schools.</p>
<p>(4) What are the application procedures?</p>
<p>[Answer] (A) Students must first register with the school; (B) those who are deemed qualified by the school principal and head teacher and are willing to be recommended can obtain application forms from the newspaper's Student Aid Fund Committee; (C) students must fill out the application form, attach a 2.5-inch headshot, and return it to the school; (D) the principal must fill out a letter of recommendation and submit it together with the application form to the newspaper's Student Aid Fund Committee for review.</p>
<p>(5) Why was the application not approved last year even though all procedures were followed?</p>
<p>[Answer] After the initial review by the newspaper, the applications are submitted to the Shanghai Scholarship Unified Review Committee for a second review. The committee must verify against the list of free tuition recipients, which accounts for 20% of the student body in each school, and ensure that the applicant has not applied for aid elsewhere, has excellent character and academic performance, and has never participated in illegal activities. In other words, if any of the above four conditions are not met, there is no hope of approval.</p>
<p>(6) What is the review process for applying for student aid?</p>
<p>[Answer] The application forms issued by the newspaper are recommended by the principal and reviewed by the newspaper. After passing the review by the Scholarship Unified Review Committee, student aid will be issued.</p>
<p>(7) Can student aid be issued according to the actual amount of tuition?</p>
<p>[Answer] This depends on the amount of donations received and must comply with the standards set by the Scholarship Unified Review Committee. In the past, student aid has generally covered 70% of the tuition. Currently, tuition fees have increased sharply, and there are too many applicants, so maintaining the 70% level may not be easy.</p>
<p>(8) How can we prevent students from fairly well-off families from applying for aid?</p>
<p>[Answer] In each round of applications, there are indeed a small number of students from fairly well-off families who receive aid. The newspaper is determined to prevent this from happening. We hope that students at each school will actively report such situations. If you encounter such situations, please report them to us at any time, and we will investigate thoroughly. We especially hope that the principals of each school will make careful recommendations, without being perfunctory or biased, so that this kind of abuse will not occur.</p>

At 8 p.m. on the 7th of last month, Jiao Xuejun, a worker from faction B, intended to settle accounts at Yuanfu Road, but faction A refused, claiming there were errors, which led to a dispute. At the same time, Huang Chunsheng and Luo Xianghe, foremen from faction B, had long-standing grudges against Cheng Xilai and others.

<h3>Couple Nearing Fifty Involved in Lawsuit for Destroying Principal's Office Over Living Expenses; Court Orders Reconciliation and Withdrawal of Charges</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Report] The district court yesterday heard a family dispute case involving a couple nearing fifty years of age. The couple's daughter was also called to testify. Xu Zichang, the principal of Jiancheng Elementary School, filed a complaint against his wife, Xu Xia, for property damage, claiming that she had been causing disturbances at Jiancheng Elementary School and had destroyed the furniture in his office on June 15. The court opened the hearing yesterday. After questioning, the court ordered the two parties to temporarily leave the courtroom and called their daughter to testify. Xu's daughter testified that she was twenty years old, currently teaching at a certain central elementary school, and studying at Lixin Accounting College. Her monthly income was sufficient for her and her mother's living expenses. Her father now has a concubine and has recently stopped paying the living expenses he originally gave to her mother. She said that her father had always been loving to her. At this point, she began to sob uncontrollably. Judge Ou then addressed both parties, instructing the plaintiff to use educational methods to influence the defendant and to pay the defendant a certain amount of living expenses each month. He ordered the plaintiff to withdraw the charges and warned the defendant not to cause any more disturbances at the school after the plaintiff paid the monthly living expenses. His words were earnest and moving. Xu Xia repeatedly clasped her hands and thanked the court profusely. The plaintiff said that withdrawing his charges against his wife required the understanding of the Jiancheng Elementary School's board of directors. The court scheduled a decision for the 7th of this month.</p>

<p>Reader Consultation</p>
<h3>Legal Clarifications: Strange Events in the Scientific Age: Dissolution of Engagement Due to Incompatible Horoscopes</h3>
<p>Jiang Yaochang asks: My relative A (male) was engaged to B (female) in 1943 through arrangements made by his parents. Now, it has been discovered that B falsely reported her age, and after re-matching their horoscopes, it is known that they are incompatible. They now intend to dissolve the engagement. Please advise: (1) Can an engagement contract entered into by parents on behalf of a minor be repudiated? (2) If B is not at fault, can the engagement be dissolved based solely on the reason of incompatible horoscopes? (3) Can the betrothal gifts given at the time of the engagement be recovered from B? If B refuses to return them, how should one respond? (4) Can a unilateral announcement be made in the newspaper to dissolve the engagement and engage to Miss C?</p>
<p>[Answer from Mr. Tang Mingshi:] (1) Males under the age of seventeen and females under the age of fifteen may not enter into an engagement contract (see Article 973 of the Civil Code). Minors above these ages who enter into an engagement contract must obtain the consent of their legal representatives (see Article 974 of the same law). An engagement contract should be entered into by the parties themselves (Article 972 of the same law). In other words, an engagement cannot be made if the parties do not agree. An engagement contract entered into by parents on behalf of a minor is not fundamentally invalid; its validity depends entirely on whether the male and female parties agree to it. (2) If the age difference between the male and female is too great, physiologists suggest that marriage may not be suitable; however, affection seems to transcend this limitation. Moreover, if there is only a one-year difference, and the difference is relatively young, it is unclear why party A intends to dissolve the engagement. Although the law advocates for honest contract formation, this case does not seem to constitute significant fraud. The notion of incompatible horoscopes is insufficient as a legal reason for dissolving the engagement. (3) Damages require fault as a prerequisite. If the fault for dissolving the engagement does not lie with party B, or if party A's reason for dissolving the engagement is insufficient, then damages cannot be discussed. Therefore, recovering the betrothal gifts is a form of compensation. (4) If one disregards everything and breaches an existing engagement without meeting the conditions for dissolution, then the offending party shall be liable for damages.</p>

<h3>National Banks Adhere to Two Major Principles: Strictly Review Foreign Exchange Payments; New Plan to be Formulated Separately for Handling Overseas Remittances</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] The National Bank Foreign Exchange Review Committee held its second committee meeting yesterday morning at 11:00 AM. Li Lixia, Lin Chongtang, Shao Huihua, and others attended. The meeting was presided over by convener Xia Jinxiong. Principles for foreign exchange review were decided upon. According to Director Xia, the establishment of this committee is to coordinate the payment of foreign exchange required by the government, merchants, and students studying abroad. All foreign exchange handling units under the Central Bank are transferred to this committee. The Non-Import Foreign Exchange Review Committee is renamed the Non-Import Foreign Exchange Review Group. The review of foreign exchange for merchant imports is still handled by the Import Management Committee, but the insurance and commission portions are reviewed by this committee. In the future, the review will adhere to two major principles: strictness and transparency. Foreign exchange for non-quota imports will be strictly reviewed. Foreign exchange for travel and sightseeing is especially prohibited. Even international conferences will be considered for approval based on their importance. The foreign exchange review process for merchants and students studying abroad will be completely transparent to dispel doubts and avoid unnecessary troubles. Furthermore, to balance foreign exchange income and expenditure, the government has decided to establish a separate foreign exchange budget in addition to the ordinary budget. Yesterday, the Executive Yuan Foreign Exchange Review Committee formally approved the compilation of the foreign exchange budget.</p>
<p>Another report: To increase overseas remittances and replenish foreign exchange reserves, the government will soon formulate a new plan to be announced and implemented. In the future, in addition to selling foreign exchange certificates at the exchange rate, overseas remittances will also receive a subsidy of 25%. All handling fees and remittance fees will be waived. After this news spread, the selling price of foreign exchange certificates in the city yesterday rose sharply, exceeding 5 million yuan.</p>
<h3>Buyers Hesitant and Unmoving, Chinese Stocks Trending Weak</h3>
<p>Yesterday, Chinese stocks received no help from outside sources. Actual goods were sluggish and lacked appeal. Fickle buyers, aware of the difficulties, retreated. As a result, Yongsha experienced a sharp decline to the limit down near noon, the entire process marked by timidity and weakness, creating a very unstable atmosphere.</p>
<p>The market opened steady. Yongchao started at 12,800 yuan. From 11,830 yuan, numbers 65, 83, 160, 23, 11, 102, 218, 216, 13, 106, 155, 224, 71, 163, 145, 115, 95, and 111 actively sold off, causing a decline to 11,900 yuan. Numbers 54, 180, 218, 206, 185, 145, 11, and 71 slightly compensated, pushing the price up to 12,300 yuan. However, Guangdong merchants continued their selling pressure. Actual goods of yarn and cloth appeared weak, triggering another wave of panic. Numbers 224, 222, 89, 111, 213, 226, 155, 85, 4, 207, 206, 120, 55, 65, and 2 sold off, ultimately leading to a retreat to 11,430 yuan, the limit down. Near noon, numbers 99, 80, 67, 228, 187, and 154 absorbed the selling. Numbers 119, 51, 151, 55, and 4 then emerged, trending the market. Numbers 154, 47, 180, and 13 maintained the price, with the noon close at 11,550 yuan. Besides Yongye hitting the limit up, Meilin and Hengfeng experienced small declines, Xinyi remained flat, and Meiya, Xinhe, Xinguang, Tongyi, Nei Yi, Jinglun, Yonggong, Huafeng, and Xinhua each fell by 10%. The rest declined by 0.5%.</p>
<p>In the afternoon, Yongsha started at 11,900 yuan. Numbers 145 and 95 immediately sold down to 11,680 yuan. Numbers 131, 76, 69, 224, 168, 205, and 89 stepped in, pushing the price up to 12,070 yuan. With Rongfeng hitting the limit down, market sentiment remained extremely fragile. Numbers 135, 169, 164, 4, 145, 11, and 216 sold down to 11,730 yuan. Numbers 143, 218, 99, 145, 155, and 12 maintained the price. Numbers 224, 72, 180, 97, 76, 65, 156, and 95 then emerged, causing indecisive trading. National banks continued to sell. Numbers 207, 219, and 89 stepped in, with the market closing at 11,800 yuan. Compared to the morning close, Rongfeng hit the limit down, Liandi hit the limit up, Xinyi and Tongyi, and Zhabei remained flat, Jinglun rose by 0.5%, Xinhe, Quanyu, and Huochai experienced small declines, and the rest rose slightly. Over-the-counter shares of unlisted companies failed to rally, especially Huashang and Dasheng, which retreated by 0.5% due to weakness.</p>

<h3>The Money Market Trend Remains Stable, Banks and Bureaus Continue to Have Clearing Deficits</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the trend in the Shanghai money market remained relatively stable. The four banks, two bureaus, and one treasury continued to have clearing deficits during bill exchange, totaling 107.9 billion. Among them, the Central Bank had a clearing deficit of 92.63 billion, the Bank of China had a clearing surplus of 142.12 billion, the Bank of Communications had a clearing surplus of 52.51 billion, the Farmers Bank had a clearing deficit of 81.02 billion, the Central Trust Bureau had a clearing deficit of 27.06 billion, the Postal Savings Bureau had a clearing surplus of 5.01 billion, and the Central Cooperative Treasury had a clearing deficit of 9.73 billion.

<p>According to the National Government, the reasons for the clearing deficits of the banks and bureaus are: (1) payments to military and government agencies, (2) remittances for export materials, and (3) payments for purchasing flour. However, the Central Bank is closely monitoring market conditions and will tighten the money supply if there are fluctuations.</p>
<h3>Tea Merchants Yesterday Visited President Yu to Request an Increase in Tea Loan Amounts</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper Report] The tea quota for this year has been approved by the Joint Treasury of the Four Banks, and the quota has been increased. Recently, due to soaring prices and increased costs, the industry has requested another increase in tea loans. President Yu of the Central Bank met with Tang Jigan, Chairman of the Tea Trade Association, and Song Qifan, Chairman of the Tea Association, yesterday to inquire about the industry's situation. Mr. Shu Yu Guoqian gave a detailed report on the difficulties faced by the tea industry. Mr. Yu agreed to find a way to remedy the situation, and after the matter is reviewed by the Discount and Loan Committee, it will be submitted to the Board of Directors of the Joint Treasury of the Four Banks for a decision. There is hope for another increase in tea loans.</p>
<h3>Export Tea Market Is Quiet</h3>
<p>The export of Teas to Bombay, India, which used to be a major trade, was stagnant for a long time, but yesterday suddenly showed signs of recovery. Although India has been striving for self-sufficiency in tea production, due to the limitations of climate and soil, the quality of its tea is still inferior to Chinese tea in terms of color, aroma, and taste. Therefore, recently, there has been renewed interest in this type of tea. Unfortunately, the inventory in this area is insufficient, so transactions have not yet begun, but market sentiment is steadily improving. Other types of tea are also following suit and showing good performance. As for domestic tea sales, although the dealers are still trying to push prices up, the increase has already been significant after consecutive days of rising. In addition, it seems that the buyers' capacity has been sufficient, so the market lacks the momentum to rise further. As a result, various types of tea are returning to their original routes.</p>
<h3>Tight Money Supply Dampens Sentiment, Yarn, Cloth, Experience a General Decline</h3>
<p>Yesterday's cotton market conditions saw a continuing tight money supply, with no real progress in sales. Local merchants showed a lack of interest, and bulls continued to take profits, leading to a sluggish market sentiment.</p>
<p>42-count Blue Phoenix fine yarn initially saw a sharp price decline of 100 million due to rumors of a new economic control plan to be announced soon, with the physical market still under many restrictions and general floating longs eager to unload. Unexpectedly, after opening lower, buyers remained unmoved, and prices fell another 50 million. Near the close, buyers added to their positions at lower prices, recovering to 2 billion, ultimately closing at 1.92 billion yuan, a decline of 80 million yuan compared to the previous day.</p>
<p>21-count Double Horse yarn saw weak demand after opening, with initial gains of 10 million. Subsequently, due to the Spinning and Weaving Company dumping yarn at 80 million below the market price, market sentiment turned worried, and the trend lacked momentum. It ultimately settled at 1.51 billion, down a small 60 million yuan from the previous day. Other counts of leased yarn and fine yarn also declined, ranging from 30 to 40 million to 70 to 80 million, with only 52 transactions.</p>
<p>Yesterday's cotton cloth market saw tighter control over banks and financial institutions by the authorities, leading to a contraction in lending. Actual sales in the local market were sluggish, and dyeing factories were also mostly watching and waiting. Hankou merchants took advantage of the high prices to sell, while Tianjin merchants sold fine cloth to hedge against Yuan Zhi Gong Ni. As a result, Gongtou fine cloth opened higher but then fell all the way to 53.7 million, a decline of 1.8 million yuan compared to the previous day.</p>
<p>Mid-range Five Blessing and Trumpet Boy fine cloth, which had deviated too much from Longtou, attracted hedging purchases from peers, and the market once showed signs of improvement. As a result, Five Blessing fell by 1.5 million, and Trumpet Boy fell by a small 1 to 2 million. Other piqué, fine twill, and shilin cloth all showed a trend of declines exceeding gains.</p>
<p>Further news: In the afternoon over-the-counter market, Longtou fine cloth was quoted at 54.8 million, falling to 4 million, a gain of 300,000 yuan compared to the noon close.</p>
<p>Further news: The Spinning and Weaving Company's tender for Five Blessing fine cloth had a quoted price of 44.5 million yuan, and Sijun ten yuan piqué was 53.5 million to 4.5 million yuan. There were also 15 other types of Tiaoli bleached cloth, printed piqué, genuine quality, and 3A color ball fine cloth, etc., with very few applications.</p>
<p>Further news: The China Textile Corporation opened sales of 16 types of cotton yarn yesterday, issuing 344 purchase permits, selling 18,660 bolts of cloth and 100 quilts. Two purchase permits were issued to factories for 160 bolts of cotton cloth, for a total of 346 purchase permits for 18,820 bolts of cotton cloth and 100 quilts, valued at 98,713 million yuan. It also sold three types of yarn on behalf of the Yarn Tube Association, with 8 purchase permits, selling 49 pieces of yarn, valued at 6,706 million yuan.</p>
<h3>August Coal Allocation Prices Increase by 170%</h3>
<p>Yesterday, a person in charge of the Fuel Management Committee told reporters that the adjustment of the cost of living index and the direct increase in commodity prices have caused huge expenses for mine operators in various coal-producing areas, making it impossible to sustain operations. Therefore, the mine operators have requested the Fuel Management Committee to make reasonable adjustments to the allocation prices and production area prices for coal in August, increasing them by at least three times to barely support operations, otherwise they will have to stop production. However, the Fuel Management Committee believes that the increase requested by the mine operators is too large and will affect price increases, making it difficult to accept in full. After discussions at a meeting held the other day, it has been generally decided as of yesterday afternoon to allow an increase of 170%. The new prices will be implemented starting today.</p>
<h3>Materials and Finance Committee Drafts Principles for Material Loans</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper Report] The National Bank's Materials and Finance Committee held its fourth meeting at 5:00 PM yesterday, chaired by convener Li Lixia. The meeting approved the principle of providing loans for grain purchases primarily in the form of physical goods. It also drafted general principles for material loans, which will be decided upon after soliciting the opinions of the bank's Discount and Loan Committee.</p>

<h3>Slow Sales and Scarce Transactions, Rice Market Stable, Flour, Grain, Oil, and Cake Prices All Downstream</h3>
<p>The rice market lacked momentum to rise. After opening, it continued the strong close of the previous day, and merchants continued to call for higher prices. However, sales were very slow, and after fluctuating, the market weakened. Declines in various commodities outside the industry made people feel uneasy and tired. Rice shops experienced weak sales due to the beginning of the distribution of household rice for this month, and their appetite for inventory was very weak, resulting in very scarce transactions. As a result, prices rose slightly by 500,000 yuan compared to the previous day. The arrival of new japonica rice gradually increased, resulting in a unique decline of 1 million yuan. Indica rice transactions were scarce, and prices were stable. Yesterday's arrivals in the North and South markets totaled 5,915 piculs.</p>
<p>Flour was weak and declined, with sluggish actual sales and slow inventory turnover. Declines in various commodities outside the industry made people feel tired, so the market entered a weak state after opening and ultimately declined by 300,000 to 400,000 yuan. Old brand flour closed at 13.7 million, down 300,000 yuan. Battleship flour opened at 12.7 million, once reaching 12.9 million, but ultimately closed at the opening price, down 450,000 yuan. Bran fell by 600,000 to 700,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Grains declined across the board. Buyers' appetite was poor, and local sales were also weak. The market weakened from虚. Yellow soybean mills also had thin stomachs, ultimately falling by 1.5 to 2 million. Broad beans fell by 500,000, red sorghum fell by 1 million, and corn and barley from the north did not sell well, falling by 2 million yuan. Although mung bean prices were stable, sales were also slow. Sesame was slightly mixed, but generally fell by 1 to 2 million. Raw peanuts had a lot of returned goods the previous day, so they fell by 6 to 7 million yuan yesterday.</p>
<p>Edible oil declined due to declines in soybeans and other grains, coupled with lower prices in various commodities outside the circle, making people feel very depressed. Raw oil declined even more due to arrivals, with Jitong raw oil closing at 110 million, a sharp decline of 10 million. Soybean oil and rapeseed oil had a lot of returned goods sold off, each falling by 3 million yuan. Soybean oil was mostly at 86 million, and small-batch sesame oil fell by 6 million yuan. Soybean cake had more sales than purchases, falling by 500,000 to 600,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>Special Foreign Currency Certificates of Deposit Have Not Yet Been Issued</h3>
<p>Import and Export Industry Demands Prompt Issuance</p>
<p>[This Newspaper Report] The Shanghai Import and Export Association reports that the Central Trust Bureau has not yet issued the special foreign currency certificates of deposit for the price that should be paid to the original importers for goods purchased with self-provided foreign exchange without licenses, which was supposed to be paid. The Association previously telegraphed the Central Bank and the Central Trust Bureau to issue them promptly. Now, after a long time, they have still not been issued. Recently, newspaper reports have suggested that the authorities are planning to convert these outstanding foreign currency certificates of deposit into legal tender at the exchange rate of the Equalization Fund. The Association is deeply concerned that if this is true, not only will related businesses suffer significant losses, but the government's credit will also be damaged. Yesterday, they specially submitted a document to the Central Bank and the Central Trust Bureau, requesting that all special foreign currency certificates of deposit that should be paid to the original importers be issued promptly and that they continue to be used to offset import quotas as originally stipulated, in order to demonstrate the government's creditworthiness and strengthen the confidence of businesses and the public.</p>

<h3>Leading All the Way, Initial Good News Reported, Our Basketball Team Defeats Belgium, 36 to 34 in Overtime, Li Shiqiao's Appearance Greatly Boosts Morale</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, London, 3rd] Our World Games basketball team defeated the Belgian team at the Harringay Arena last night, with a fierce battle lasting 45 minutes before a winner could be decided. Finally, in the five-minute overtime period, they narrowly defeated the Belgian team with a score of 36 to 34. The entire process was extremely tense. The addition of forward Li Shiqiao as a fresh force greatly enhanced the team's strength. Throughout the entire game, our team maintained the lead, indicating that the victory was not accidental. With seven minutes remaining in the game, our team was still leading by seven points, but afterwards, the shots were inaccurate, and we were unable to score. The Belgian team scored three goals and one free throw in a final effort, tying the game. After the five-minute overtime period, our team scored two goals, exceeding the opponent by four points. The opponent also scored one goal, ultimately losing to our team by two points. The game was fast-paced and intense from the start. After Huang Tianxi won the jump ball, our team immediately took the initiative, but because of inaccurate shots, we were unable to score. The Belgian team scored first, creating a record. Li Shiqiao and Cai Wenhua (captain) each scored a goal, coming from behind. After that, our team maintained the lead, with the forwards taking quick shots and having good form, making it difficult for the Belgian team to defend. In the first half, the score was 18 to 13, with our team leading by five points. After the break, our team added two more points, and the forwards' clever passes and shots were greatly praised by the audience. Near the end of the game, Huang Tianxi was fouled out, which had an immediate impact on the entire team. With four minutes remaining in the game, the Belgian team made a strong comeback, tying the score at 32 to 32. After the overtime period, our team sealed the victory with two free throws, and the Belgian team ultimately lost. The main reasons for our team's victory were the effective control under the basket by guards Huang Tianxi and Bao Songyuan, and the good coordination and accurate shooting of forwards Cai, Li, and Wu. Also, the highest scorer in last night's game was Cai Wenhua with 15 points, Li Shiqiao scored points, and Wu Chengwei scored 7 points.</p>
<p>[United Press, London, 2nd] The Chinese basketball team played against the Belgian team on the evening of the 2nd. Li Weiqiao, the "small but mighty" general of China at five feet two inches, recovered from his illness and took to the court. The Chinese and Belgian teams put on a wonderful performance, with little to separate them. In overtime, China finally defeated Belgium 36 to 34. The Chinese team took the lead, but the Belgian team caught up later, adding points frequently. At the end of regulation, the score was tied at 32 to 32. In overtime, it was generally believed that the physically strong Belgians would win, but they underestimated the "Little Li" and "Old Bao" of the Chinese team. Bao Songyuan was awarded two free throws. "Old Bao" lived up to expectations amidst the cheers of 1,500 spectators, scoring two swishes, making the score 34-32. Li Shiqiao followed suit, also earning a free throw opportunity, and did the same, scoring both free throws, making the score 36-32. The Belgian Zylber was unwilling to be outdone, scoring a goal with one hand, bringing the score to 36-34. As the Belgian team advanced into Chinese territory, the bell rang, ending the game. China won by one goal, 36 to 34, over Belgium.</p>
<p>[United Press, London, 2nd] After the Chinese basketball team narrowly defeated the Belgian team on the evening of the 2nd, Belgium made an astonishing move to file a protest with World Games officials regarding the outcome of the match. Belgium's protest is scheduled to be heard at 5:00 PM on the afternoon of the 3rd. The reasons for the Belgian team's protest will not be announced until then.</p>
<h3>Basketball Upset: Chile Soundly Defeats Philippines, USA Barely Beats Argentina</h3>
<p>[United Press, London, August 3rd] The Chilean basketball team, previously unknown, suddenly appeared in peak form on the 2nd, defeating the Philippine team, who were considered strong contenders for the group championship, by a score of 68 to 39.  With this victory, Chile is expected to advance to the final eight. Every member of the Chilean team scored at least once, especially Menghana, who put on an outstanding performance, scoring 18 points individually. The Philippine team played unusually poorly. Due to their smaller stature, they lost possession of most rebounds, and their previously excellent shooting skills seemed to have disappeared. In the early part of the first half, the Philippine team took the lead with a score of 6 to 4. However, Menghana, like a tiger released from its cage, scored from various angles with great ease. With free throws and field goals, Chile took the lead and maintained control of the game throughout, leading 29 to 16 at halftime. In the second half, Chile continued to press on, with Leidema and Jiale also contributing significantly. As a result, the Philippines suffered a devastating defeat with a final score of 39 to 68.</p>
<p>[United Press, London, August 3rd] The seemingly invincible American basketball team almost suffered a Waterloo on the 3rd. Fortunately, their luck turned in the last minute, narrowly defeating the Argentinian team by a score of 59 to 57.</p>
<p>Basketball Outlook</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, London, August 3rd] The Philippine basketball team, which had attracted much attention, unexpectedly lost to Chile today with a score of 39 to 68. When our basketball team made its debut on the 30th of last month, they also lost to Chile by a narrow margin of five points. However, their star forward, Li Shiqiao, was unable to play due to illness that day. Our national basketball team, along with the Philippines, Korea, Chile, and Iraq, are in Group B. Last night, we defeated Belgium 36 to 34. Iraq is considered the weakest team among the six in the group and has already been defeated by Korea and the Philippines by a large margin. Therefore, our team's easy victory over Iraq was expected. If our team can defeat Korea tonight, their chances of qualifying for the finals will become clearer.</p>
<p>[United Press, London, August 3rd] In the Olympic basketball tournament, Belgium defeated Iraq by a large margin, 98 to 20.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, London, August 2nd, United Press] In today's basketball games, Canada unexpectedly lost to Hungary. Canada was generally considered the second strongest team in the Olympics after the United States. Now, they might not even make it to the semi-finals. Hungary, previously overlooked, now has a great chance of entering the basketball championship game. Hungary only lost to Brazil by a score of 47 to 41. The United States defeated Czechoslovakia 53 to 28, and France defeated Cuba 37 to 31.</p>
<p>[French News Agency, London, August 3rd] In today's Olympic basketball games, Peru defeated Switzerland 40 to 19, Mexico defeated France 56 to 42, and Belgium defeated Iraq 98 to 20. Uruguay defeated Italy 46 to 34.</p>

<h3>Our Soccer Team Meets Strong Opponent: Loses to Turkey 4-0: Turkish Army Lives Up to Its Reputation; Formidable Strength</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, London, August 3rd] In the preliminary round of soccer, our team lost to Turkey 4-0. The match took place yesterday afternoon at the Wassam Seven Road Stadium. The strong Turkish team incredibly scored three goals within five minutes in the second half. Our team was able to resist the Turkish team in the first half, with the Turkish team only scoring one goal at the end of the 45 minutes. Overall, if it weren't for the outstanding defense of goalkeeper Zhang Banglun and defender Hou Rongsheng, our team would have conceded even more goals. Hou's performance at right back was particularly outstanding, and Zhang made many important saves. In the second half, the Turkish team's offensive became more intense. Within four minutes, they scored two goals from 25 yards out, and less than two minutes later, they scored another goal. Twenty-five minutes into the second half, our team's left winger, Zhu Yongqiang, was injured and had to leave the field, leaving us to play with ten men. Both teams were hampered by the muddy field after the rain, which affected their agility. After the start of the game, the Turkish forwards immediately launched an attack on our defense. Fortunately, Hou Rongsheng managed to kick the ball out several times. In total, the Turkish team attempted to score at least six times in the first half, only scoring one goal in the 18th minute. Our team also attempted to score several times, but failed to break the deadlock. In the last few minutes of the second half, our team stepped up its attack, but was unable to break through the Turkish team's strong defense. Zhu Yongqiang's injury had a significant impact on our attack. Although our forwards made a final effort before the end of the game, they were unable to penetrate the opponent's defense and get a shooting opportunity.</p>
<p>[Report from This Newspaper] London, August 3rd Broadcast: The Chinese soccer team was defeated by Turkey 4-0 in the rain yesterday and was eliminated in the first week. The score was 0-1 at halftime. In the other three games of the first week, Sweden, Italy, and Korea were victorious.</p>
<p>Corner Kicks and Headers: Turkish Team's Masterpiece</p>
<p>China's defeat was due to the failure of its forwards to break through Turkey's central defense. Even when good opportunities arose, they failed to calmly seize them and take effective shots. On the defensive end, their headers were weak, which turned every high ball into a Turkish opportunity. The Turkish winger Guelson's well-placed corner kicks were especially difficult for the Chinese defenders to handle. The first goal was scored by Turkish center forward Hillary Kelek, who headed the ball in from a corner kick.</p>
<p>Under the close watch of the Turkish defenders, the Chinese forwards also failed to perform well. Although Zhu Yongqiang was closely marked, He Yingfen and Xie Wenliang both had several good shots, but they were all saved by the Turkish goalkeeper. At the end of the first half, Liu Songsheng even hit the crossbar. The Turkish team lived up to its reputation. Its strength was comparable to that of a professional English team. Their corner kicks and headers were particularly impressive, and their forwards were especially fierce and terrifying.</p>
<p>Yongqiang Shut Down: The Forward Line Shattered</p>
<p>The match began at 6:30 PM at Watson Steel Stadium. The constant drizzle made the field wet and the ball heavy, which affected the smaller, more agile Chinese players significantly. The Turkish team had many burly players, which gave them an advantage on the slippery field. China attacked first, but was blocked by the Turkish defenders. Zhu Yongqiang made several aggressive runs, but without success. This attracted the attention of the Turkish defenders, and he was closely marked by Igen, a large Turkish center back. From then on, the two were inseparable, and the Chinese forward line was broken up, reducing the threat to the Turkish defense.</p>
<p>Header Opens the Score: Record Broken</p>
<p>With the first half nearing its end, Turkey launched a counterattack. The five forwards infiltrated the Chinese defense with crisp, short passes. Center forward Hillary Kelek shot hard near the goal, and Zhang Banglun made a flying save, conceding a corner kick. Just as China was relieved to have escaped danger, Guelson sent in an excellent corner kick, and Hillary Kelek was perfectly positioned to head the ball into the net, opening the scoring. China launched a full-scale counterattack. He Yingfen and Liu Songsheng both had attempts on goal, but they were saved by the goalkeeper. They also gained two corner kicks, but their headers were unsuccessful. In the final minute, Liu Songsheng had a great shot, and the goalkeeper was unable to save it. It looked like the ball was going to go in and equalize the score, but unfortunately, it hit the crossbar by a hair's breadth, causing the crowd to sigh in disappointment.</p>
<p>Banglun Busy: Another Three Goals Conceded</p>
<p>At the beginning of the second half, Zhang Banglun made a spectacular save, bravely diving at the feet of Guelson to clear a dangerous ball. A few minutes later, Zhang made another diving save, earning a round of applause from the crowd.</p>
<p>Seventeen minutes later, Hillary Kelek scored again with a shot from 20 yards out, hitting the upper left corner. The Chinese team was visibly shaken by this blow, and the Turkish team seized the opportunity to attack again and score another goal, making it 3-0. Finally, Turkish player An Tonyaddis scored a goal in the scramble near the goal, sealing the victory with a score of 4-0 and advancing to the second week, where they will face Sweden.</p>

<p>Free Talk · Monologue by Ji Yong</p>
<p>In these sweltering days, rats are running rampant, even daring to climb onto beds and into mosquito nets. As a result, I lie awake all night, listening to the snores of my neighbors, feeling extremely miserable. This reminds me of Qu Yuan's famous line, "Everyone is drunk, but I alone am sober," which is truly an unbearable situation. No wonder he angrily went to Peng Xian's abode to practice swimming.</p>
<p>Imagine a situation where "Everyone is sober, but I alone am drunk." What would that be like? Undoubtedly, I would be laughed at and ridiculed by the sober people. At banquets, we often see such jokes among those with a low alcohol tolerance who still like to overindulge. However, the person in question doesn't feel any pain because he's already drunk. Being drunk is being muddled, and being muddled is "hard-earned." While we find him laughable, he might be feeling ecstatic, thinking he's amazing. Outsiders may see it as a tragedy, but the person involved doesn't feel it at all. What is considered bitter or sweet is subjective. Finding joy in a situation that others find miserable is like getting an unexpected fortune when everyone else is struggling, which is cause for celebration. Perhaps they will feel embarrassed after sobering up, much like waking up from the Nanke dream or when the yellow millet is cooked in the Yellow Millet Dream, a grand performance has been experienced. Even mentioning it brings a pleasant kind of embarrassment. There's a passage in "Suiyuan Poetry Talk" about a wall inscription in Handan that says, "Forty years of duke and marquis, although it's a dream, it's still romantic. Now I'm down on my luck in Handan, I need to borrow a pillow from you, sir!" This actually represents the desires and psychology of most people and is not just a mere renovation of old ideas, as Yuan Mei praised. After Yue Zhongqi was dismissed from office, he was reinstated and sent to conquer Dajinchuan and Xiaojinchuan. When he passed through Handan, he also wrote a verse: "Just because I haven't finished worldly affairs, I'm dreaming of becoming a marquis again." This is clearly a coquettish statement. Everyone understands the difference between the mortal world and the divine realm. Being a marquis in the human world is the same as being a god; otherwise, everything is negated. So, although being drunk is not considered wise, the reason why most people flock to it is because there's a great deal of cause in it.</p>
<p>It's the sober ones who suffer. While everyone else enjoys the pleasure of the Handan dream, you're the only one listening to the rats squeaking, gnawing on books in the drawer, and watching the eerie twinkling stars, feeling suffocated and sweating. Isn't that even harder? As the saying goes, "How can I tolerate others sleeping soundly beside my bed?" This sentiment is indeed disgusting. Even if it's not my bed but my neighbor's, I still can't stand hearing it, let alone someone comfortably rolling around on my bed! If it were not a sound sleep but wakefulness, then that would be a different story. The ancients had methods like sharing a bed for late-night talks or listening to the rain together, how good it would be to have a companion! The problem is that those who come to occupy my bed are rarely there to talk to me and ease my worries, but mostly there to borrow a pillow to indulge in their dream addiction. This is why it's unforgivable and intolerable. Perhaps this is what Qu Yuan was talking about?</p>
<p>Moreover, it's said that dreams are when the human subconscious is active, and reason loses its effect. When awake, you're Tao Yuanming, but when drunk or asleep, why can't you be Shi Miyuan, Liu Yu, Yi Kuang, or Jia Sidao? Not willing to bend over for five pecks of rice is only because it's too little - nowadays, it's twenty million! - if it were fifty pecks of rice, you might just bend over in a flash! Saying one thing so loudly, how can you immediately slap yourself in the face? Now that you're drunk and dreaming, not only can others forgive you, but you can even find reasons to excuse yourself. In novels, people are often told, "Don't blame it on being drunk and dreaming!" This shows that if you're really drunk and dreaming, you might be able to get understanding. Wise readers should understand that the reason being drunk is not as good as being awake lies in this, and the reason being awake is even worse than being drunk lies especially in this! In this way, the awake person is even harder to deal with against the majority of drunk and dreaming people - right and wrong are determined by the majority. Ibsen's theorem "The minority is always right" is just a complaint and can't be put into the rules of procedure. - Black can be turned into white, white can be turned into black. The clay pot and dull knife that Jia Yi and Qu Yuan were angry about, and the regrettable yellow bell and Moxie sword, are probably due to this. How can one cope with what is called "using a clear heart to receive the dirt of things!" In this situation, besides finding Peng Xian to go swimming, there's probably only one medicine that can cure it - sleeping pills.</p>
<p>The price of sleeping pills is also rising; I can't afford them. Otherwise, I would really make up my mind.</p>
<p>The Big Scale by Ruyi</p>
<p>In the sixteenth century, Europeans made a point of hunting and killing witches, claiming that witches had magic and often flew through the air on broomsticks. A woman suspected of being a witch was often burned alive by the public, and even if she was truly innocent, she had no chance to defend herself. However, some wise officials, seeing that they could not violate public anger, came up with a clever method: they erected a large scale in the downtown area. After the crowd caught a "witch," those officials would kindly ask them to weigh the woman. After weighing her, they would announce her weight and declare that such a heavy body could not possibly ride a broomstick and fly - the crowd had nothing to say, and the woman's life was saved. Even today, you can still see these scales in the villages and thoroughfares of the Netherlands.</p>
<p>Remembering Alian by Zi Jiao</p>
<p>Knowing three or five characters, she's always busy learning to write, the clay doll sharpens the pencil, asks her mother to find paper. She suddenly wants to use the toilet while eating, and asks for candy again when she gets into bed. People say she's pretty, and she's happy wearing new clothes. She talks to herself and carefully examines herself in the mirror.</p>
<p>She takes off her little socks while sitting, and drags her adult shoes while walking. She rolls her cloth pillow and quilt, and coaxes her doll to sleep. She tears half a piece of paper, and wipes her snot on her grandfather's coat. She goes up and up the railing, and asks her mother if she is being obedient. Sometimes she cries loudly, wanting her mother to go to the street.</p>
<p>She eats vegetables first while eating, and doesn't move the rice when the vegetables are gone. It takes a long time to feed her a meal, and the ground is covered as if with seeds. She clucks and clucks, calling for the chickens, and spoils them even when she's angry. Put her on the ground and she shrugs her shoulders and jumps for joy.</p>
<p>Her seven hands and eight feet get water all over her when washing clothes, and she doesn't care when her mother scolds her, saying she can do it too. She watches her grandfather paint orchids and laughs at him for not being able to paint them like her. She needs help to see the sun and moon, and thinks of a fairy in the sky. Her grandfather has a hard heart, regretting she wasn't a boy. Tears fall like strings from his venerable side, and Alian stares blankly. Her grandfather is an excellent scholar, regretting that she's not a boy!</p>
<p>Russell on the Scientific Temperament by Ze Shi</p>
<p>Since the news that the "non-eating" Yang Mei was not actually not eating, I have seen many articles mocking Chinese scientists for being unscientific, arguing that, according to science, people absolutely cannot live without eating, and that Chinese scientists were making a big fuss about the "non-eating" Yang Mei, which is absolutely unscientific.</p>
<p>I don't understand science, and I dare not comment on whether Chinese scientists' enthusiasm for the Yang Mei incident is in line with science. It just so happened that tonight I was reading Russell's "Skeptical Essays," in which Chapter 12, on "Free Thought and Official Propaganda," mentions the scientific temperament. I thought it might be worth copying. He says: (According to Yan Jicheng's translation, Commercial Press edition)</p>
<p>"In recent years, we have had an excellent example that can be used to illustrate the scientific temperament in our minds, and that is the theory of relativity and its popularity in the world. Einstein, the proposer of the theory of relativity... the predictions about the theory of relativity... were confirmed by the British expedition sent to observe the solar eclipse of 1919. His theory destroyed the entire framework of traditional physics; it was almost as unfavorable to orthodox dynamics as Darwin's theory was to the biblical Genesis. However, physicists all over the world, after the evidence obtained was proved to be in its favor, expressed a very quick attitude of recognition, and did not harbor any resentment because it overturned the entire physical framework that thousands of scientists had worked so hard to build. However, none of these many supporters of the theory of relativity believed that Einstein had achieved the final and most complete success - Einstein especially would not think so. He did not build a monument of permanently indestructible beliefs that could stand for thousands of years. In today's physics, there are still some problems that he cannot solve; in the future, there will always be a day when his theory will be modified, just as it is currently modifying Newton's theory. This kind of critical, non-dictatorial humility is the true attitude of science."</p>
<p>He also says:</p>
<p>"A true scientist with a scientific perspective will never fail to acknowledge with utmost humility that the scientific knowledge that is considered acceptable today must be revised and supplemented with the progress of discovery... The place where we can find the closest to pure knowledge today is only in science, and in science, human attitudes and perspectives can only be regarded as experimental and full of errors." Russell's words are certainly not golden rules - Russell himself especially would not think so. But as a view of the scientific temperament that is different from ours, I think it is worth reading, and if I were one of the scientists studying Yang Mei, I would especially cite it to deal with those who mock me.</p>
<p>Not Seeking Detailed Understanding by Qian Dacheng</p>
<p>Tao Yuanming claimed that he did not seek detailed understanding when reading books, so later those who read books carelessly all claimed that they did not "seek detailed understanding." In fact, this is a big mistake. The "detailed" that Yuanming spoke of is the "detailed" in "Lao Tzu's departure is too detailed," which is also the "excessive" in Confucianism's "excess is as bad as deficiency." Understanding the ancients through reading should be just right, not far-fetched or deeply convoluted. The first thing is to grasp the meaning of the ancients, not to "carve a boat to seek a sword." As Yuanming said, "There is true meaning in this, but I have forgotten the words to express it." Seeking detailed understanding is being meticulous about the words of the ancients and forgetting their meaning. The Thirteen Classics and their commentaries are an effort to seek detailed understanding, but as a result, the meaning of the ancients becomes even more obscure. Feng Hao's annotations of Li Shangyin's poems are an effort to seek detailed understanding, but the result is that readers are even more confused and lost in a fog. The root cause of this problem is being far-fetched. Autocratic emperors also sought detailed understanding of the writings of dissidents. For example, Emperor Taizu of Ming suspected that a monk was mocking him for being a monk and a thief in his thanksgiving memorial, which contained the two sentences: "Heaven created a sage to be a model for the world." His reasoning was that "birth" and "monk," and "model" and "thief" are homophones. Emperor Shizong of Qing also sentenced a civil service examination invigilator to death for setting the question "Where the people live," because he believed that the two characters "Wei" and "Zhi" cut off the head of "Yongzheng." This is deep convolution. The era in which Yuanming lived was full of the atmosphere of "far-fetched interpretations" in terms of academics and "deep convolution" in terms of politics. He himself was a liberal, breathing in the atmosphere of Lao Zhuang, accepting the traditions of Confucius and Mencius, melting Taoism and Confucianism into one, striving for "moderation" and striving to "remove excess." The highest realm of any academic thought and art in the world is being just right. Yuanming's greatness lies in this. The later generations' lack of detailed understanding when reading books is just a way for those who have not achieved anything in reading to excuse themselves by borrowing Yuanming's words.</p>
<p>The attitude of observing world affairs should also be not seeking detailed understanding. Not experiencing it at all is being muddled; being too shrewd will inevitably lead to being sharp and critical. Only with the state of mind of "picking chrysanthemums under the eastern fence, leisurely seeing the southern mountains" can one reach the state of "having been caged for a long time, returning to nature."</p>
<p>I have already said a lot, and saying more will inevitably lead to seeking detailed understanding. Let's stop here.</p>
<p>Two Little Dots by Shi Jimi</p>
<p>We are as demanding of those we love most as we are of those we hate most, and it seems that we are even less forgiving of the former.</p>
<p>Listen, you who love beauty: if you want people to praise your beauty, it is best that you have no kindness, no sincerity, no talent... In this way, people will remember only your beauty.</p>
<p>If you have a peaceful heart, you can still enjoy tranquility and peace even in the most bustling city.</p>
<p>A pearl has no brilliance, but it has its own inner splendor.</p>
<p>Is calling a servant to have dinner with you the same as eliminating the class system? Can giving a beggar woman on the street 10,000 yuan be called a great philanthropist?</p>
<p>Few women still have themselves after marriage, because they remember themselves too much, so they cannot become good wives and mothers. - So after a woman gains a last name, she mostly loses her individuality.</p>
<p>Being Friendly to the People by Diao Ying</p>
<p>Being an editor of a publication can sometimes feel very dull.</p>
<p>Hollywood movie star Thomas Mitchell was originally an editor. The publication he edited was called "The Woodbridge Weekly." One day in 1913, he felt extremely bored, so he went for a walk on the beach in New Jersey. He picked up a clam and put it on the sand to see if it would walk back to the sea. He sat on the sand, watching quietly.</p>
<p>Suddenly, he heard footsteps on the sand, and someone asked him what he was doing. But Mitchell was too lazy to look up and just grunted.</p>
<p>The person squatted down in front of him.</p>
<p>Everyone was silent for a long time. The person said, "This is the first time I've seen such a lazy guy."</p>
<p>After a while, Mitchell said, "That's right."</p>
<p>The two started talking sarcastically. The person became impatient and imitated Mitchell's lazy tone of voice. But Mitchell still refused to look up at him. Finally, the person asked Mitchell, "Where do you work?"</p>
<p>Mitchell said slowly, "In Woodbridge. I edit a magazine. What about you?"</p>
<p>The person said, "I used to mess around at Princeton University. Now I've finally found a good job. I'm the president."</p>
<p>Mitchell couldn't help but look up, and in front of him was indeed the smiling Wilson!</p>
<p>In addition to affecting prices, the "second round of large-scale currency printing" has also lost the standard value of "easy exchange." It is inevitable and natural that real objects and spot goods will take their place.</p>
<p>The trend of discussing rent in terms of "flour" has been popular for a long time. Although the government has banned it several times, it has gradually become a dead letter. People say that those who "eat roof tiles" (northerners call those who live off rent "eating roof tiles") are ruthless and mercenary. However, the education sector is an intellectual class, and private primary and secondary schools openly and secretly demand tuition fees in "flour!" In comparison, the moneylenders are not worth criticizing. Primary schools require at least one bag per term, and secondary schools require three bags. This is the most common. However, a certain church school in Dongcheng requires as many as eight bags per term, so the others that only require three or four bags are relatively "cheap." (However, although church schools charge high fees, applicants are more enthusiastic. This mentality can be compared with the fact that Yenching University and Fu Jen Catholic University have a stronger appeal than other private universities.)</p>
<p>It is not surprising that "collecting tuition fees" and "collecting rent" both adopt the "flour-worshipping principle," as the matter is close to common customs. On the one hand, "demanding flour" can reduce the stimulation of large numbers. After all, the tuition fees for a secondary school for one semester "require hundreds of millions!" Even if they are converted to the price of flour, it is understandable, but it would take too much effort to explain, so it is better to simply "demand flour!" which implies an explanation and is also very practical, which is a win-win situation. (Before the incidents, church secondary schools charged more than 20 yuan per term, which was also equivalent to the price of eight bags of flour at that time.) On the other hand, the standard of real objects has become a common trend among the public and private sectors, and since grain taxes have been levied in kind, government employees are more enthusiastic about insisting on in-kind allocations (flour, cloth, oil, salt, etc.) than adjusting currency numbers. As for rickshaw drivers' bargaining, they open their mouths for two or three hundred thousand, and then follow up with the ratio of "one catty of mixed flour," which is already an unspoken common expression.</p>
<p>What was formerly known as "gold-worshiping" should now be changed to "flour-worshiping" (in Jiangnan it may be "rice-worshiping"?), because even gold money is inferior to the rise in food prices. The second is "gold-worshiping," but this gold is gold, US dollars (also money but with the use of gold), and "white gold" (silver, especially round ones, which are in line with needs). As for domestically produced "paper gold," although it is still in circulation, most people express an attitude of not "worshiping" it.</p>
