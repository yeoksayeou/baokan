<p>〔本報蚌埠十四日電〕確息：華中勁旅第十四兵團宋希濂部全部，芷向蚌埠調集，卽將加入蚌宿戰塲作戰。又，今有三列軍車，運戰車部隊抵蚌。</p>
<p>〔本報蚌埠十四日電〕剿總公布：蚌宿會戰匪軍在國軍磁鐵橡皮戰法吸引聚殲下，半月來匪傷亡已逾十二萬，軍事當局爲掌握戰機捕捉匪軍主力計，生力軍正源源過蚌北開。</p>
<p>〔本報蚌埠十四日電〕國軍第十二兵團在黃維，胡璉兩將軍統率下，於澥淝兩河之間，對團攻於該部陣地四周之劉伯承陳賡兩部匪軍九個縱隊以上之兵力，進行血戰，今日已步入第十九日，匪野心未死，刻除增援頑抗阻擊於國軍南下與北上之兩路大軍之前外，復傾其全力猛撲黃兵團陣地。根據各方報吿，該兵團兩日以來，其處境似已進入更艱苦階段，某負責人士相告：該都爲集中兵力，加强反擊力量計，業於兩日前放棄大營集及羅集兩據點，而以雙堆集爲核心，北面伸出約五華里，南面伸出約八華里，東西各約爲三華里，形成一橢圓陣地，豎立於澥淝兩河之間，日來以熾烈砲火壓制來犯之匪，並以戰車大砲分向東北東南兩面十公里以外之匪軍陣地射擊，在匪軍之全綫攻擊下，該部甚難覓得向外擴展之機會。另據軍方消息：雙堆集以北偏東五華里處之大王莊，爲該部所築小型機塲之外圍據點，自昨晚迄今拂曉，匪猛犯該處，正展開激戰。記者復訪另一關係方面稱：該兵團之補給已略感困難，前兩日天氣欠佳，空投固屬不易，卽以近兩日天氣轉晴而言，僅恃空投亦難免有不敷之感，燃料亦甚缺乏，惟在此艱苦狀態下，士氣仍不稍袞，日夜浴血苦戰，殲滅頑匪達六萬人以上。按黃兵團爲華中勁旅之一，其安危所繫，固不僅關係此度會戰之得失，故此間當局正以無窮關注，靜候黃兵團之捷音，並以最大努力促使李兵團之北進。</p>
<p>〔本報蚌埠十四日電〕作爲蚌宿會戰重心之南綫戰鬥，雙方今晨在激戰之下，一求進展，一求阻礙，據記者所知，今日國軍已攻克包家集南北附近數村落，其中包括較重要之高王集（在包家集北十華里）。記者曾聞某兩官員談稱：「今日情况爲國軍少淮展，匪情無變化」。按南綫目前局面，右翼已抵達在澥河北岸下瓦疃集之對岸及高王集·陳集（附近）一綫，左翼則係自包家集以東地區向西迂迴至仁和集南側，全綫陣勢恰似一顚倒且反置之「了」字，在此狀態下」，國軍右翼似稍突出，故匪卽堅守包家集，不但阻碍國軍之左翼，且制右翼不敢繼續前進。綜觀全局，南綫戰事之開展，似有待於加强戰鬥力，而此一行動刻正由當局積極調度中。</p>

<p>〔合衆社南京十四日電〕共軍劉伯承及陳毅部隊正在以全力從事蚌埠西北之戰爭，但自各方觀之，已遭遇國軍之堅强抵抗而受阻止。劉伯承部隊已出動全力，不但其幹部，甚至受過一半訓練者及農村壯丁亦已調至戰塲，向國軍黃維兵團猛攻。但黃維兵團已將共軍攻勢逐退，但尙無突圍之足够力量。同時，蚌埠北上之國軍李延年兵團已抵雙堆集東南十哩，黃李兩軍團相距僅五哩，協助李兵團之機械化部隊在空軍掩護下，向包圍黃兵團之共軍步步進逼。</p>
<p>蚌埠徐州剿總十四日宣稱：向杜聿明將軍率領下李彌兵團進攻之共軍，已使用蘇聯製之坦克車，在戰塲上曾見到過四輛此項坦克車。共軍使用蘇聯製造之坦克車攻擊國軍此次尙爲首次。</p>
<p>〔聯合社南京十四日電〕軍息：邱淸泉將軍之第二兵團已突破徐州與宿縣間之共軍圍攻棧而到達豫南之項城。</p>
<p>〔中央社蚌埠十四日電〕軍息：（一）我前綫國軍今又有新進展。據剿總公佈：我杜聿明各兵團，十三日以來，北綫於魏樓·孫閣地區，將犯匪鬨殲後，刻已向南進擎，據守李樓郭樓兩大據點之匪已呈動搖。（二）困守李樓郭樓之殘匪，爲挽救其危機，竟向我攻擊部隊施放毒氣，幸我早有防預，故無大損傷。國軍將士對匪此種慘無人道之行爲，極爲憤恨，故士氣益奮，攻擊愈猛，該兩據點之匪將全被殲。（三）陳毅匪第三·七·九·魯中南各縱隊，及陳賡之九縱隊曁叛軍吳化文何其澧等部，業經我由徐南下兵團擊潰，刻逃竄宿縣西北濉溪口·苗橋中集一帶，從事整補。</p>
<p>〔又電〕共匪廿一旅及卅四旅約五千餘人，於十二日晨進犯我管店·張老營·嘉山·小王營四據點，我交警第（二七九）三總隊，在周偉龍中將指揮下，對來犯之匪迎頭痛擊，自晨六時至下午二時，將匪大部擊潰，計斃匪一千餘人。同時我駐防滁縣沙河集之國軍某師亦出動一部，於是日下午四時在小王營，解決匪之一個團。此兩股犯匪經我交警部隊與國軍某師合剿後，斃傷三分之二以上，其餘殘部趁深夜大霧逃竄。</p>

<h3 id="c15">蔣夫人美國行 <a href="#c15" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e15" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">15</a></h3>
<p>— 本報駐美特派員毛樹淸寄自紐約</p>
<p>「聖牛號」專機，把蔣夫人從加里福尼亞接到華盛頓，十二月一日的早晨，華盛頓國家飛機塲上，擠滿着成羣的新聞記者，蔣夫人帶着滿身疲勞走出飛機，顧大使第一個上前握手歡迎，一位年輕美麗的小姑娘，他們喊她作「裘棣·王」的，給蔣夫人送上了一束鮮花，短短幾分鐘的忙亂之中，這印象是够生動的。</p>
<p>馬歇爾夫人最初坐在飛機塲上的休息室裏，她從人羣背後擠上前，向蔣夫人喊「哈囉」！全美國的報紙，都特別把這一點標舉出來，因爲馬歇爾夫人是當今美國杜魯門王朝之中，被唯一「選派」出來的代表來歡迎蔣夫人的。不用說，杜魯門本人是不會來飛機塲迎接的，杜夫人和小姐也沒有來，就連馬歇爾本人，趕緊借「檢查身體」爲名，溜進華盛頓的「李德」醫院去迴避，副國務卿羅維特也沒有來，其他的，什麽參議員。衆議員。連半個影子都沒有看見。</p>
<p>蔣夫人的內心是感傷的，比二千多年前的楚國大夫申包胥，更要「難受」，申包胥當年在秦國痛哭，對他個人，還是有生以來第一遭，蔣夫人今天爲了祖國而來華盛頓承受各種各樣的「難堪」，雖說出發點跟申包胥當年相像，但就她個人的際遇來說，不是一個平常的女性能勝任的。時光僅相隔短短六年，六年前的同一天日子，同一個飛機塲上，蔣夫人被美國朝野像「寳貝」一樣前呼後擁，六年以後的今天，還是同一個蔣夫人，却遭遇到這樣難堪的冷淡。</p>
<p>全美國的報紙，都用「冷淡」一個字，描寫蔣夫人的「秦庭」之行，紐約一張左傾的華僑報紙，說蔣夫人「吃冷湯」，杜魯門平常萬事都含含糊糊的，唯獨對中國問題，斬釘截鐵，態度非常倨傲，大選揭曉以後，杜魯門在佛羅里達海濱休假，那時候，正是中國局面開始逆轉的時候，若干共和黨的國會議員，有的主張緊急撥款，有的主張召開國會特別會議，杜魯門一概「相應不理」，他穿一件半截襯衫，在海濱做他的「柔軟操」，那時候，馬歇爾在巴黎，美聯，合衆傳出的上海電訊，說馬歇爾在巴黎答應王世杰，保證增加對華援助，這眞是活見鬼的事，後來馬歇爾回到華盛頓，在某次記者招待會上筆者當面問過馬歇爾，他根本否認有此一說。（下文轉入第四版）</p>

<h3 id="c16">社論　從大西洋公約說起 <a href="#c16" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e16" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">16</a></h3>
<p>聯合國大會不歡而散之後，國際局勢更加顯示出嚴重的趨向；美國將如何應付未來的發展，當爲世人所密切注視。據法國新聞社華府十三日電稱，杜魯門總統馬歇爾國務卿曁國會領袖范登堡康納萊等人，對於美國次一行動，均主張在馬歇爾計劃及大西洋公約之下，加緊援助西歐各國，從而促進西歐各國的團結一致；同時美國國防安全委員會，亦持同一見解，並認爲一俟大西洋公約簽訂之後，耶將進行締結地中海防衛條約之談判，以建立一普及全球的安全制度，共同防制蘇聯的侵略。</p>
<p>從這個報道裏，不難看出下面幾個事實：（一）杜魯門主義與馬歇爾計劃，仍爲美國今後外交政策的骨幹，換句話說，美國「反共防蘇」的老調，依然不變。（二）美國外交活動的重心，仍在歐洲；換句話說，不論亞洲的危機如何嚴重，馬歇爾的「先歐後亞」的政策，也仍將不變。姑不問大西洋公約與地中海公約能否如美國外交當局的願望而得以次第實現，但這兩個公約的締結是否就是全球安全制度的成立，我們不能不抱着懷疑的態度。</p>
<p>組織大西洋集團的觀念，產生在第二次大戰期間，英美兩國朝野對於這個新的國際運動，均抱着贊助的態度，惟因世人憧憬着「一個世界」的遠景，終未能實現。當時美國名記者李普曼氏曾撰文鼓吹，並提出一個具體建議，他主張參加大西洋集團的國家應包括南北美洲各國及歐洲英·法·荷·比·盧·丹麥。葡萄牙。西班牙·瑞士·希臘·義大利·氷島諸國；就是菲洲的南菲聯邦，乃至太平洋的澳洲紐西蘭菲律賓諸國，也應該全體參加。今日美國外交當局所以要繼大西洋公約之後，組織地中海聯防，就是李普曼氏建議的實踐，把兩個公約來促成大西洋集團的實現。</p>
<p>這兩個公約刻正在華府進行談判，以目前的實際需要而論，確是大西洋兩岸各國所共同需要的。在西歐言，今日苟欲抵抗共產主義的勢力從東歐侵入西歐，則非依賴美加兩國在經濟上軍事上的援助不可；而在美國，爲反共防蘇計，亦需要將其國防綫移至西歐各國。所以，我們預料到，華府的談判，一定進行得非常順利，不久就可以商得圓滿結果的；同時我們也可斷言，這兩個公約的締成，對於抵抗國際侵略勢力，對於促進世界和平，一定會有很大的影響。</p>
<p>不過從整個世界的角度去觀察，大西洋公約地中海公約能否達成其保衛世界和平的任務，却是一個嚴重的問題。因爲世界的和平是不可分割的，儘管大西洋兩岸的各國能像鐵一般的團結，共同抵抗國際侵略勢力，得以保全局部的和平與安全，但只要他處有一天擾　不安，或戰亂相乘，則大西洋也沒有苟安瓦全的可能。歷史的敎訓是可寳貴的，是最値得各國政治家外交家深切反省的。姑以目前的國際局勢而論，西歐各國在馬歇爾計劃與西歐公約之下，當可苟安於一時，現在錦上添花，再締結一個大西洋公約，似乎格外可以高枕無憂，但觀於亞洲的情形，從東南亞而中國，由中國而東北亞，無處不顯示出亞洲危機的嚴重，而美國又偏偏祗知實行「先歐後亞」的政策，甚至將反共的急先鋒——中國，幾乎視爲無足重輕，而坐視亞洲的沉淪。美國在目前或猶以爲得計，認爲有了大西洋公約就能保障世界和平，殊不知先歐後亞必鑄成歷史性的大錯，將來終不免自食其惡果，使大西洋公約及地中海公約，也將喪失其意義。歷史的殷鑒是不忽視的！</p>
<p>政治家是講現實的，外交家尤其要重視現實。現正當華府談判大西洋公約之際，我們希望在華府的政治家外交家都能正視現實，不固執，無偏見，重定普及全球的安全制度。亞洲的人民都在這裏翹首矚望華府的次一行動！</p>

<p>〔合衆社華盛頓十三日電〕國防方面消息靈通人仕十三日吿合衆社稱：美國正在考慮在日本建立一枝十萬人至十五萬人之武裝警察軍隊。彼等談稱：就軍事上言之，美國遠東政策，並未計劃予以激劇改變，但在逐漸蛻變中，卽日本在佔領軍撤退後不致成爲眞空地區。美國對此事之第一次正式考慮，乃根據自日返美之艾契堡中將贊成日本成立一枝十二萬五千人之武器警察軍隊。在此後，中國局勢日趨惡化，發生有關美國對亞洲政策之新問題，而形成組織日本安全軍隊之考慮。但國防方面靈通人仕堅持稱：並無激劇改變計劃。該方指出，所有在日佔領軍隊，受政策之委託解除日本武裝，日本憲法亦規定日本完成武裝解除，惟日本可在其內地保持某項供警察目的及維持秩序之軍力。另一方面稱：計劃中之日本十五萬軍力，不致與政策與憲法抵觸。據傳稱：在數月之前，麥帥贊成將佔領軍所未使用之大批陸軍物資按助中國政府，但目前局勢已改變，在數個月之前被認爲剩餘或不能使用之存貨，現已視爲對防務重要者。諸如C-54型飛機零件，已自存貨堆中取出應用。鑒於局勢在改變中，據未能證實之消息稱：麥帥已要求强力之增援及要求美政策議訂者考慮武裝日本。至於美全國安全委員會是否在考慮此一政策尙未獲悉。該委員會之決議，乃極爲秘密者，卽使已決定亦不公佈。然較該委員會低一級方面稱：美正在進行一枝日本武裝軍隊之準備。該方皆稱：當佔領軍撤離日本時，日本顯然不能無軍隊。故日本需要成立及訓練一枝堅强及紀律良好之軍隊。該方又審愼地指出，美國務部及全國安全委員會，皆不能議訂美國政策，杜魯門總統及議會可能廢止兩者之政策及命令重制訂全部遠東政策。根據過去趨勢，杜魯門及議會常聽從國務及陸眾部之勸吿。</p>

<p>吉田茂兩月前上台時曾宣佈將根絕政府之「醜事」，俾日本能爲國際所尊視。其反對黨此次天賜良機，已迅予利用。泉山不爲其本人置辯，惟稱：其妻對渠矢信不渝。渠十四日仍宿醉未醒，稍感不適。由於泉山案引起軒然大彼，七百億日元之追加預算案及反對黨十三日所提之不信任案竟擱置一邊。</p>

<p>另一「受侮者」松尾夫人（四十一歲）吿記者稱：泉山曾緊拉其手，然稱：「我不願大驚小怪我當然認爲男女議員間應講禮節，不過我不願學山下夫人那般報吿，照我看來，大多數的男人還不是和泉山一般的嗎？」</p>

<p>對棉布易米疑案表示決予流底查究</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕記者昨訪蘇浙監委行署，探詢該署最近所澈查之中央銀行辦理存兌黃金及限價時期棉布易米兩大案件，承監委倪弼與行署秘書王亞武告稱：國行存兌黃金舞弊嫌疑，曾三度派員實地調查，查閱賬目結果，發現國行職員未經排隊而兌購黃金達二千餘兩。至於各報所載本月十日央行分發申請書疑點，經查悉第一號申請書係發予一中國銀行職員，第三號給予一學生，可能係門警徇私，予親友方便。至於其他外傳行員勾結大戶，暗收手續費等情，尙未獲得證據，行署將繼續調查。</p>
<p>棉布易米案，行署曾指派調查組張正宗負責進行調查，日內將分訪各有關機關查詢。王秘書特强調謂：食米爲民生必需，共供應情形足能影響社會秩序之安定，行署得行使監察權力，且此案內幕複雜迷離，耐人尋味，行署職責所在，務必澈底調查，揭露全部眞相，公諸社會，如確有舞弊證據，將呈監院嚴加究辦。並將通知中央銀行，中國紡建公司，在全案未查明前，所有棉布暫停撥付。同時在限價時期本市機關，學校，市民等購存米店之食米，嗣後若干米店以被搶購爲藉口强照限價結付現款，監署曾收到關於此類控訴兩件甚多，現亦擬一併澈查云。</p>
<p>米商公會於十四日下午四時許推派代表印福祥等十餘人至紡建公司請求，對該項棉布二萬疋准予提貨，由該公司副總經理吳味經接見，據吳氏表示：該項棉布當時國行允照限價撥給棉紗，而國行迄今尙未將棉紗撥出，故未便准予提貨，須俟本人與國行洽商後，亦可作最後決定。</p>

<p>〔中央社訊〕上海市各界慰勞前綫將士代表團，完成蚌埠前綫勞軍任務後，十三日離蚌過京，昨日下午返抵滬。記者此次隨同該團訪間戰地，目睹前綫國軍堅强旺盛之士氣，與忠貞衛國之精神，深信宿蚌會戰，定獲輝煌戰果，淮上必將成爲華中共匪之墳墓。而此次會戰，亦將與光耀史册之淝水之戰，後先輝映。記者在華北最前綫，親睹國軍以優越之火力，奮勇衝殺，在一小時內，擊潰陳毅匪部一團。在進剿過程中，總統次公子蔣緯國參謀長，親率其戰車部隊，以高速度衝擊，達成協同步兵向前推進之任務。蔣公子親臨前綫指揮，予將士精神上以極大之鼓舞。</p>
<p>李延年司令官，在前綫以堅定之語調告記者稱：國軍在淮北戰塲，必操勝券，渠指出會戰開始以來，國軍在正確的戰略指導原則下，已消滅共匪大部戰鬥主力，瓦解共匪脆弱的戰鬥意志。目前犯匪已成動搖狀態，連日携械向我投誠者甚多，與我旺盛之士氣，恰成强烈的對照。甫自東北轉進，由劉粹皋師長率領之精銳部隊，已馳赴淮河北岸，展開激烈之攻勢，加速北進大軍與黃維兵團之會師，全師官兵鬥志堅强。淮北前綫大部國軍，均爲身經百戰之老戰士，對嚴肅之軍中生活，至感興趣，民族意識尤爲堅强。京滬慰勞團蒞臨前綫慰勞，使火藥氣味之戰塲，流露人間熱情，官兵尤爲感奮，前綫將士願以不斷的勝利，爭取不斷的慰勞，後方民衆則願以不斷的慰勞，迎接不斷的勝利。</p>

<p>貧富懸殊應速接近</p>
<p>宣司令繼吳氏之後致詞，感謝各方盛意，臨別贈言，特別指出上海今日有小康局面，係黨政軍民精神合作，經過若干風波與困難而獲得者，初非倖致，當前問題已更爲嚴重，渠於此時離開，殊感歉意，但渠深信，上海已有一個良好之合作基礎，本此基礎努力，必能使上海繼續安定，進而安定全國。渠發表在滬主持軍警工作兩年餘來之感想稱：毋庸諱言，上海六百萬市民今日之生活方式，尙未達於公平合理，尙存在有許多隔閡，與利害衝突，此種因素不予消滅，則上海仍具有危險性。渠稱：因過去之經濟制度而使上海人民之間有顯明之貧富懸殊，在與共匪作生死存亡之鬥爭之現階段，此種懸殊應速予接近，如何使六百萬人和衷共濟，協調團結，成爲一整個力量，爲今日應積極努力之標的。</p>
<p>安定實為第一要義</p>
<p>今日少數人僅知逃難，而不知此存在於上海之危險因素，能先予消滅，則上海無異爲鐵的堡壘，何患乎共匪。渠最後謂衢州現爲第二綫，與上海唇齒相關，渠望各界仍不時賜敎，而使第二綫得以鞏固</p>
<p>新任警備司令陳大慶致詞，指出如何使上海之商業繼續發達繁榮，如何使上海之文化敎育，繼續進步，而仍成爲全國之領導。渠貢獻三點意見：作爲共同努力之鵠的：（一）勞資合作，解除工商業當前之難題，（二）發揮正確而有建設性之與論力量，領導民衆與政府合作，（三）唯有在治安鞏固秩序正常之情形下，才能開展一切工作，故安定實爲第一要義。渠坦白承認軍隊方面尙有若干缺點，正作有效之改進繼由市參議會議長潘公展氏代表各界致詞歡送與歡迎，渠鄭重指出宣司令之臨別贈言與陳司令之三點指示，値得全體市民深深體味與感激。渠列舉宣氏在滬之數項功績謂：若干星星之火，當可燎原，而爲宣氏領導之軍警及時救熄，人民或以其未燎原而不了然，若如燎原則將不堪設想？宣氏在自由與民主之要求下執行維持秋序之任務，實至不易。潘氏認陳司令必將「蕭規曹隨」，而續使上海獲得安定。潘氏强調「自求多福」之義，籲請全上海市民今日必須要大澈大悟，自求多福，必須先有旺盛的民氣，才能有旺盛的士氣，必須先盡國民之天職，才能卒國民的自由，故吾人要貢獻一切力量主特政府，以人民的力量來改變這局勢，改變國際人士的看法，誠如霍夫曼與白吉爾兩氏所謂「唯有中國人才能救中國，」吾人如能自救，外援必漸源源而來。最後潘氏獻贈宣司令大銀鼎一座，於熱烈情緒下散會。</p>

<h3 id="c96">蔣夫人美國行　（上文接第一版） <a href="#c96" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e96" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">96</a></h3>
<p>有人說：蔣夫人這次來遲了。一個月，要是早來，局面或不會如此僵，這話有理。這次蔣夫人來，是在杜。馬會談大策決定以後，美國現政府的外交政策，不便隨便再來一個更改，這是事實，所謂「杜·馬會談」，是杜魯門大選獲勝以後，馬歇爾出席聯合國大會任務完畢，帶着一腔「怨氣」歸來，爲了杜魯門的卑鄙的「文生事件」，不惜犧牲國務卿，來博取婦孺羣衆的選票，馬歇爾回來，原打算大發作而特發作，第一·要質問杜魯門，到底爲啥要玩那些花樣？第二步。再和國防部長福萊斯轍一齊辭職。</p>
<p>但是，杜魯門也有他圓滑的，一套，他心平氣和地慰問馬歇爾，說馬歇爾是第一流才能的愛國主義者，馬歇爾接受了那麼一連串的「高帽子」，總算把辭職之意暫時打銷了。以後，杜·馬就開始商談世界危機，杜魯門全力支持援助歐洲的「馬歇爾計劃」，亞洲呢？費用太大了，暫時冷觀罷！就這樣，杜魯門又發表了一連串對華政策的聲明，借款不借，麥克阿瑟不派，僑民撤退，甚而至於發表聲明「官方沒有邀請蔣夫人」！</p>
<p>蔣夫人來遲了一步，但仍然不辭跋踄而來，美國民族性，有一個怪習慣，他們往往對那些不避艱險，不怕難堪，獨力奮鬥到底的人，特別表示同情。這次杜魯門大選是一個例子，蔣夫人到華盛頓以後，中國大使館接到許多邀請蔣夫人演講的機關團體公函，筆者執筆寫此訊時，蔣夫人演講的計劃，還沒有決定。大多數有見解的人都主張蔣夫人應該公開演講，從東岸到西岸，坦白告訴美國人民，中國的處境和杜魯門政府的態度，讓美國人民有個公正的批判。</p>
<p>因爲杜魯門政府對中國政策到現在還沒有明瞭，美國輿論界，很少論及將夫人這次之來，紐約時報在杜·馬會談以前，曾經好幾次大聲疾呼加强對華援助，杜。馬聲明發表，決定繼績保持「無政策之政策」以後，時報已不再發言了。倒是紐約的一張小型報紙「紐約鏡報」，在華府表示冷淡蔣夫人以後，寫了一篇痛斥「國務院」的文章，說國務院辦的是糊塗外交，國務院的專家，都沒有好好讀過遠東歷史，因此，一方面支持歐洲反共，一方面又叫中國容共。</p>
<p>紐約鏡報的評論記者，引證李鴻章與羅班諾夫的一八九八年中俄條約，說明沙皇時代重視東方的野心，然後說到今天史達林步武沙皇的做法，乃至於幾年來美國對遠東外交的盲日。鏡報說：「祇有這種糊塗的外交官，才會這樣做」。「才會：高興的時候，把蔣夫人捧之若神明，不高興的時候，自己一溜烟逃進醫院，讓我們多少年來盟邦的婦女領袖，在華盛頓遭受像難民一樣的待遇」！</p>
<p>勇敢的蔣夫人，她跑去醫院找馬歇爾，作了二次長談，內容還沒有發表，ABC廣播電台報告說：「蔣夫人夫醫院看馬歇爾，馬歇爾態度之傲慢，如若接見德國和”本的人民代表」。</p>
<p>WBC電台一位廣播記者，幽默的報告說；「杜魯門這幾天，正忙於重新安排美國的寳藏，讓勇敢的蔣夫人找不着美國的金銀何在」？</p>
<p>什麼時候，蔣夫人纔能發現這寶藏？什麼時候，纔能贏得同情？那就要看時機和智慧的運用了。但是無論如何，蔣夫人是被美國人民共同愛好的，紐約前鋒論壇報的主筆動勒（哥侖比亞敎授）寫進：「不管國策的好惡如何，蔣夫人總是被美國人民祟敬和喜愛的，她是美國有史以來，第一個外國婦女，能够贏得美國人士的廣大讚美」！</p>

<p>— 本報記者梁小中</p>
<p>〔本報廣州十二日航訊〕江淮一戰，把廣州帶入更進一步的繁榮。</p>
<p>月來潮水一樣的人流，從華北華中湧到這華南重鎭，把廣州可以住的地方都塞滿了。從「必要時的準備」以至躑躅街頭的「外江佬」，都成爲談話裏最刺激的資料。</p>
<p>廣州市區的房屋，大約有十八萬間，以之分配於六十餘萬人口，本來一向就有寸金尺土之感，疏散之潮一起，華東的粵人要南歸，「外江偌」江浙湧到，香港居不易，廣州自然最理想。於是你搶我奪，「競投之下，必有高價」，廣州的房東也懂得了「條子」的好處。一座小洋房，獅子大開口，三五七條，不愁沒人垂肯。地價掀起了空前的漲風，動輒索取港幣黃金，因此，疏散南來的外地人士，在難尋立錐之地的苦悶心情中，已有不少人嗒然歸去。</p>
<p>疏散潮帶給外來者居住的麻煩，也給居民帶來的生活的威脅，很像京滬一帶驚人的物價，亦隨而疏散南來。據有關方面的統計：廣州目前物價，一月來平均上漲三倍强，較京滬高逾一倍。（公用事業一項價目，卽五倍於上海）。要在通訊上報導最近的物價，非至郵局面前始行寫入，實不足以言準確。因此，忙於「逃難」南來的人們，大可三思而後行。</p>
<p>由於情勢的轉變，廣州的地位無可否認地已經日趨重要。宋子又主席坐鎭南疆，邇來的辛勞忙碌，遠非外人所可想像。卽如一個警察所長之微，亦至躬親委任，爲的自然是强化華南整個治安的鞏固。據廣州綏靖公署最近宣佈：「華南各地治安，經嚴密佈署，頃已足以應付任何突發事件之發生」，同時分電各淸剿區，加緊掃蕩轄區毛匪，以策萬全，幷計劃下年度征兵廿萬，鞏固地方，一連串的措施，將使華南有金湯之固。</p>
<p>另一方面，資源的開發亦隨軍事而進展，黃埔港口正式宣佈開放後，物資的暢流，已日漸趨於理想的境界。宋子文主席爲求加强運輸效能，最近特撥鉅款，限令加速完成粵漢路的黃埔支綫，將來美援物資抵達，卽將以黃埔爲起卸地點，沿粵路輸送戰區，其地位之重要，可想而知。同時，由於各地工廠以及資委會所屬部份機構的南遷，輸出入口的重心自滬南移，已愈益促成廣州的工業繁榮，一切都在迅速的進步裏，四千萬人在埋頭苦幹蓬勃之狀，廣東實不難在宋子文主席的領導下，再度發揮北伐時代的革命精神與力量！</p>
<h3 id="c103">川加緊民衆組訓 <a href="#c103" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e103" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">103</a></h3>
<p>〔本報成都十日訊〕全川自衛委會成立後，決召開全川民衆保川禦匪救國大會，省參會受命擬訂安川禦匪方案，全川人民開始總動員，次第實行緊急措施。軍事上展開自衛組訓，精練民兵二百萬，請准中央撥發自衛槍十萬支，借用民間槍支，擴充保安部十六個團。此外並擴編川軍五師，包括孫震二師，羅廣文，楊幹材，向敏志各一師，並計劃另一機動性的民衆自衛兵團。政治上，廣開言路，團結朝野，澈底剷除貪汚，澄情吏治，動員民衆，政府與人民合組戡衛川新機構。經濟上，征收自衛特捐，强迫有錢出錢，全面管理物價與控制物資</p>
<p>自衛組訓，目前各縣均已次第進行，根據省府擬訂的「川省民衆自衛組訓方案」內容：（一）各縣市居成立民衆自衛組訓總隊，縣長兼總隊長，另專設副總隊長負實際責任。另鄉設自衛大隊，保設自衛分隊，三級分層負責，統歸省保安司令部統籌指揮。（二）自衛隊以保分隊爲茶幹，由每保就所轄各甲，抽調壯丁一至三人輪番組訓。（三）自衛隊員，本不脫離生產爲原則，年在十八至四十五歲之壯丁編組。（四）本「人不離槍，槍不離鄕」之原則，基層幹部均由分隊自選。預計此項組訓工作明春全部完成。</p>

<p>〔本報金華十二日訊〕成千成萬的學生，狼狽地從中原各個城市逃跑出來，大槪臨走得過於倉促，他們儘可了所能帶了一肩舖捲和一些零星的衣着外，什麼都丟了，走向茫茫的東南一路。這些流亡靑年又帶着疲憊的行脚，經京滬杭綫向着浙贛綫上飄泊。</p>

<p>剛剛復軌的浙贛鐵路，設備極度簡陋，驟然加上這麼一副疏運流亡學生的擔子，實在有些不勝負擔。於是，除了一二次特快車勉强照常行駛外，其餘三·四·五·六·七·八·四一·四二，各次客貨列車車底，自上月九日起，全部移作疏散流亡學生之用。僅僅上月十日起至二十五止，短短半月間，共計疏散河南豫章·鄭中。鄭工·開中·開師·汲中·郾中·商中·許中·中正·許師等十數校流亡學生，總計當在二萬人以上。</p>
<p>記者最近曾往蘭谿·金華·衢州三地參觀過許昌師範，豫華聯中及河嶽聯中等三校，學生慘苦之情狀，與學校艱窘之情况，三校無分上下。除河嶽聯中，曾由衢州綏署湯恩伯主任代爲設法搭蓋茅屋外，其餘大多侷促在祠堂廟宇中，席地而臥，白天帶看僅有的一二册書，站在曠野里閱讀，夜間則三二個人共覆一條薄絮，瑟縮在泥地上。如今，已是初冬時節，許多學生苦得連棉衣也沒有，以肉體抗拒着寒風，他們都以極大的耐心，艱苦忍受着流亡生活。</p>

<p>— 本報記者　劉孟痴</p>
<p>〔本報貴陽十一日航訊〕貴州地處雲貴高原，多山少水，境內雖有烏江，南北盤江等河流貫穿其間，惟以崇山峻嶺，懸崖峭壁，旣無舟楫之便，又乏灌溉之利，且每當夏洪秋汎，反而滋生禍端，沿河居民，深以爲苦。近年來，研習水利工程者，多方搜尋山川奧秘，用以開發蘊藏資源，或利用水位落差，興修發電工程，或排洩積水深潭，開辦農田灌溉，補偏救枯，對農村經濟繁榮，裨益良多。黔省主席谷正倫自今夏主政以來，卽以「開發地面資源」爲建設主旨，對興修農田水利，增加糧食生產，尤爲努力不懈。最近由省府常會通過開發本省西北路之威寗草海六萬餘市畝土地面積，三八〇平方公里總流域水利工程，預墊本年十至十二月測量隊全部經費，洵爲努力後方建設，支援前方戡亂之一優良施政，爰將有關開發草海種種，撮要報吿，以饗留心後方建設事業之讀者。</p>
<p>水淹草海</p>
<p>草海位於黔省西北路咸寗縣城之西，據縣誌所載，該處原爲一廣大平原，四山之水，匯成河流三道，貫穿其間，分注於羊關山對岸江家灣附近龍王廟前之消水深潭，及凹河之數十枯洞中。遜淸道光二十七年，霪雨連綿，山洪暴發，崩濤澎湃，挾沙抱石，將所有消水各洞破壞塞沒，以致宣洩不靈，平原淹沒，大地陸沉，水行洄漾，寖久成「海」，其面積約爲四十五平方公里，約合六萬七千五百餘市畝，大好良田，一旦被水淹沒，損失之慘，可想而知。</p>
<p>早期施測</p>
<p>至光緖十八年總鎮蘇元瑞曾開鑿洩水溝，將積水導入黑岩洞，旋以蘇氏去職而工作停頓，雖功效未著，但水位已略降低。迨至民國三十年六月，該縣縣長周敷世，請求省府派隊勘查，前貴州省農田水利貸款委員會遂於是年十月組織「草海測量隊」派員率隊前往作初步勘測，惟其目的在着重明瞭排水設計之是否可能，故僅施測大橋至黑岩洞一帶地形，未能及於草海全部，費時二月，始稍得其梗槪。</p>
<p>工程中斷</p>
<p>當時農貸會測量隊根據初測結果所擬具之排水計劃，草海面積共爲四十五平方公里，草海流域面積爲一八〇平方公里，此外，另有一河注入草海，該河流域面積爲二〇〇平方公里，故草海之總流域面積實爲三八〇平方公里，其水面高度爲九八·一四公尺，（假設水準基點高度爲一〇〇公尺，設於大橋西側李姓屋基上）海底最深高度爲九四。三四公尺，（普通海底高度多爲九六公尺）假定五日內可排盡，則排水量爲二五〇秒立方公尺，此爲開始徘水時期所需之數，一且排水渠成，水位卽行下降，以後宣洩自靈，其繼續排水量當可减低爲上數之五分之一，計爲五〇秒立方公尺，是爲以草海現有容積估算之排水量。該隊根據此次估算，其設計之開發草海排水工程，計分二部份完成：第一部先將積水排去，第二部設渠灌溉農田。此外，並可能利用隧道洞排水，發六〇〇瓩之電力，以繁榮附近之農村工業。據民國三十二年八月照此工程計劃所編擬之預算，約需工款七〇·六五四·〇〇〇元法幣，嗣因農行未允貸款，復受敵侵黔南，大局深受影響，此項工程，遂又告中斷。</p>
<p>再度停工</p>
<p>其後，威密縣府因感該項工程，關係地方利益甚大，故於卅三年五月，召請地方士紳集議決定，由地方自行計劃辦理，分爲五年完成。關於工方部份決徵工興築，石工部份則籌款開辦，惟以地方收益欠充，財源有限，仍堅請農行每年貸款一千萬元法幣作爲補助，終以未獲農行承認，工程再度停滯，致使此四十五平方公里之廣大平原，聽任棄置不用，殊爲憾事。</p>
<p>重興水利</p>
<p>谷正倫主席前月出巡本省西北路各縣，道經威寗返省以後，目睹西北路各縣農產不豐，難以自足之種種苦楚，深爲扼腕，認爲唯有開墾荒地，興辦水利，增加糧食生產，乃為救濟當地農村之不二法門，當令飭貴州省水利局對於威寗草海排水工程切實計劃興辦，俾便恢復過去田畝，增加糧食生產，且便將來叙昆鐵路與湘黔鐵路在該縣接軌之後，地方得以配合發展。農貸會測量隊當日初測所得圖籍報吿與各種紀錄，或因重點有失簡略，或因年久散佚過多，目前要談開發，就非向中央要錢不可，要錢就需要預算·計劃·測量圖籍等物決不可少，水利局沒法，又只好再囘頭去重走測量的路子。</p>
<p>勘測報吿</p>
<p>最近，據該局第二科科長兼測量隊隊長蔣雲新曁測量隊一行八人抵達草海後，施測已逾半月之初步報吿看來，謂草海水位最近幾年來又有大的變化，最深處不過六七公尺，最淺處僅約一公尺許，實為我國內陸中所僅見之最淺的「海」。其淺而淸澈部份，舊日阡陌尙可顯明見到，一且水流宣洩之後，恢復耕種，當無疑義。測量工作，目前仍在天寒地凍之下積極進行着，明年二月底決可全部完竣。據水利局局長張洪昌語記者：一俟測量工竣，圖籍記錄編妥，卽可擬具詳細工程計劃，送請中央編列經費預算，並盼能早日撥發，希望在明春可以籌備施工，則明年貴州西北路的糧食問題，當可獲得大部份解決，而「農家樂」的歌聲，那時又可以在縐眉愁眼的貧苦農民口中含笑播送出來。</p>

<p>— 本報特約記者　子健</p>
<p>〔本報香港十二日航訊〕「吾人不可能與共產主義妥協，一個人不能與魔鬼妥協……彼等干涉吾等之生活方式，因此吾人必須堅決抗拒。自法西斯魔王消滅後，吾人今日又再面對另一惡魔，卽共產主義是也。在其對於人類靈魂毫無不理合之程度來看，可謂一如法西斯暴政。……」。</p>
<p>這是香港總督葛量洪九日晚在香港戰後第一次軍警大演習之後，在香港大學摩利臣宿舍的一段演說，（見十日工商晚報）。港督在這個時候，聲言「勿與共黨妥協」，已引起此間人士相當注意。我們記憶所及，港督上月曾遠訪麥克阿瑟將軍，後來又南下星加坡舉行東南亞英屬地會議。平時在香港一個公園旁側住得平平穩穩的港督，現在也似乎要忙起來。港督在這篇演辭裏，除了聲討共產主義的不是外，還以嚴厲的口氣向跋扈跳樑的共黨提出警吿。他說：「共黨人士必須明白，假如吾等愛好和平之人士如屬被襲時，吾人必將反抗，同時吾人必須不要欺騙自己，亦不能由人欺騙」。</p>
<p>港督這篇演說是不是針對香港境內的共黨而發呢？</p>
<p>再來一次演習</p>
<p>香港軍警大演習，前後四天，已於九日上午九時正式宣佈結束。英軍參謀長亞力山大中校表示，演習成績「尙稱滿意」。亞力山大透露：英軍當局準備在明年二月，再舉行同樣性質的演習一次。</p>
<p>路透社八日偷敦電：英國防部長亞力山大八日在下院稱：鑒於共黨的推進，香港的安全措施，已獲不斷注意。英殖民地次長威寗斯亦稱：政府已採取各種可能步驟，阻止香港的人口過份擁擠與混亂云云，看來香港的情形，現在已勞倫敦諸公分神關注了。</p>
<p>這個電訊發出後，十日英文南華早報，以「香港安全」爲題，報道現在星加坡保衛樹膠園和錫鑛對付馬共游擊戰的廓爾喀來福槍隊，（Gurkha　Rifles）將於本年年底前調來香港增防。廓爾喀來福槍隊是一種印兵，身裁高大，以饒勇善戰著名。廓爾喀民族大半居於中印邊界的尼泊爾附近，他們由英人招募來作保護英國利益的主要武力，由來已久，在兩次大戰中，都替英國盡過了不少力量，現在他們又不辭道遠，快要到香港來了。</p>
<p>此間某報近載一幅漫畫，插寫一個剛從上海來的豪客，看見英軍演習，不禁大驚失色。這個豪客假如他讀過了記者這篇報吿，他也許簡直要望香港而却步了吧。</p>

<h3 id="c112">各地原棉已大量登塲　聯購會加強收儲　昨例會決定再增資金二億元 <a href="#c112" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e112" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">112</a></h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕國棉聯購委員會昨舉行例會，討輪經過，以國內各地原棉，刻正大量登塲，爲充實原棉存底，調劑農村金融計，決再增援資金，展開全面收購工作。結果決議再增購棉資金二億元，由中央銀行與中國紡建公司各半負祖。按購棉資金原額約二億元，方於上週例會時增資二億元，連本週所增之資金，購棉資金總額已達六億元。全部資金，決於本月內撥足。</p>
<p>該會自展開收棉工作後，刻已收足廿二萬担，本月底前收足五十萬担之數，可無問題。蓋依目前情形，僅漢口一地，祇須有充份之資金，日收萬担毫無問題。</p>
<p>又民營廠前繳紗一萬二千件，按限價時每件作價七八九元。茲中央銀行予以收購，特予貼補，每件作價六千五百元，共計價款五千餘萬元。</p>
<p>〔又訊〕國棉聯購會收購棉花，截至目前止，業已收足二十餘萬担。上項棉花，大部份配予國行及紡建公司，分配予民營紗廠者，爲數不多。緣民營各廠，參加聯購業務單位甚少，其間雖有一二家，但以未繳第二批週轉金，故所得配額，亦未前往提取。又悉：近來聯購會各地收花機構，收汛極旺，滬漢兩轄區棉農登門求售者，頗爲踴躍。緣自戰局緊張以來，民營各廠，收花工作，多未展開，甚且業務方針，亦多徬徨不定，而各廠之重要負責人，又頗多離滬，故收棉工作，轉成冷落。似此情形，可能影響明年度棉紡工業之原料供應，故聯購會擬爭取時間，增加收儲國棉計，將商請國行及紡建公司等多撥資金，俾在旺汛期內，可以儘量收購云。</p>

<p>茲據國行業務局李副局長筱莊告記者稱：近日外傅存兌金銀，卽將加以限制，黃金每人限兌二兩，銀元限兌二十元等節，全非事實。昨（十四）日存兌金銀，黃金仍爲十兩，銀元亦照舊額四十九元。至於每日發出申請書數量，是否予以增加，藉以增加通貨回籠一點，央行方面亦無任何決定。蓋該行刻正等待財政部之兌換金銀新辦法之公佈。</p>
<p>兌金新辦法包括三原則</p>
<p>頃據新目之金融管理當局人士透露，關於存款兌換金銀新法，其中包含有三項原則：</p>
<p>（一）防止「黃牛黨」及「有力份子」之包辦。（二）使全體人民有普遍兌換之機會。（三）限制兌換數量，藉以避免少數有錢階級之大量兌換套利，與重蹈過去拋金政策之覆轍。</p>
<p>彼並謂財政部方面，業已根據是項原則，擬定詳細辦法，日內卽可正式公布。至於外傅政府存金，經最近數日來之搶兌後，已感空虛之說，絕對不確。藍日來各地兌換人數雖日見衆多，然兌換數量不大，故政府對於今後金銀之兌換，必可本旣定方針辦理</p>

<p>據工業會發表，罐頭食品工業槪况如下：民國三年僅泰康公司設廠製造麵包餅干及罐頭食品，民國七年繼有冠生園工廠成立，製造各種糕點及罐頭食物，與泰康公司號稱食品工業二大巨頭。至民國廿二年，又有梅林罐頭廠成立，以製造罐頭爲主。其後有偉大·吉美·如生·開林等廠，相繼創設。本市共有大小工廠十六家，工人一〇七四人，設備有製罐機一一二部，冲床十二部，脚踏冲床三七四部，剪刀車七部，蒸缸二六個，製鍋十五個，抽氣機九部，打蛋機二部，橘皮車一部，打蓋機二十部，靑豆剝壳機四部，揀豆機三部，番茄機八部，打碎研磨機九部，糖果機廿一部，製汽水設備二套，自動餅干製造機二套，製品每年可產各種罐頭食品三十一萬箱，各稀瓶裝調味品二萬五千箱，餅干十三萬聽，散裝餅干三六萬斤，花彫三千六百箱，麵包細點五百五十萬件，汽水鮮橘水及菓子露二十萬打。其所用原料，大部份爲國產食品。僅馬口鐵每年需四萬箱，銅板紙玻璃紙招貼紙等八千令，燃料油一百廿噸，以及一部份化學原料，採自外貨。唯最近國內工資物價高漲，產品外銷不易，且外銷僅及過去之半，而外埠因交通不便，華北內地一帶銷量大减，本市又因人民購買力薄弱，市塲有供過於求現象。而工廠日常開支激增，故多有減工狀態云。</p>

<p>[Our Correspondent in Bengbu, 14th] Reliable sources report: The entire 14th Army Corps under Song Xilian of the Central China crack troops is being transferred to Bengbu and will soon join the battle on the Bengbu-Suxian battlefield. Furthermore, three military trains arrived in Bengbu today, transporting armored units.</p>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Bengbu, 14th] The Pacification Headquarters announced: In the Bengbu-Suxian campaign, the communist troops have suffered over 120,000 casualties in the past half-month under the Kuomintang army's "magnet and rubber" warfare tactics of attracting and annihilating them. To seize the initiative and capture the main force of the communist troops, fresh troops are being continuously deployed north of Bengbu by the military authorities.</p>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Bengbu, 14th] Under the command of Generals Huang Wei and Hu Lian, the 12th Army Corps has been engaged in bloody battles for the past nineteen days against over nine columns of communist troops belonging to Liu Bocheng and Chen Geng, who are attacking the corps' positions between the Xie and Fei Rivers. The communist troops, unwilling to admit defeat, are not only reinforcing their stubborn resistance and blocking the Kuomintang army's southward and northward advances but also launching all-out assaults on the Huang Corps' positions. According to reports from various sources, the corps' situation seems to have entered a more difficult stage in the past two days. A responsible source stated: In order to concentrate forces and strengthen counterattack capabilities, the corps abandoned the strongholds of Dayingji and Luoji two days ago and formed an elliptical defensive position centered on Shuangduiji, extending about five li to the north, eight li to the south, and three li to the east and west, situated between the Xie and Fei Rivers. They have been suppressing the attacking communist troops with intense artillery fire and using tanks and cannons to fire at communist positions more than ten kilometers away to the northeast and southeast. Under the communist army's full-scale attacks, the corps finds it very difficult to find opportunities to expand outward. According to military sources, Dawangzhuang, located five li northeast of Shuangduiji, is an outer stronghold of the corps' small airfield. Communist troops have been attacking the area fiercely since last night until dawn, and fierce fighting is underway. The reporter also learned from another related source that the corps' supplies are running somewhat short. The weather has been unfavorable for the past two days, making airdrops difficult. Even with the improved weather in the past two days, relying solely on airdrops is not sufficient. Fuel is also scarce. However, under these difficult conditions, morale remains high, and they are fighting bloody battles day and night, annihilating over 60,000 stubborn communist soldiers. Huang's corps is one of the crack troops of Central China, and its safety is not only related to the success or failure of this campaign. Therefore, the authorities here are paying close attention and awaiting good news from Huang's corps, and are making their best efforts to promote the northward advance of Li's corps.</p>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Bengbu, 14th] As for the southern front, which is the focus of the Bengbu-Suxian campaign, both sides were engaged in intense fighting this morning, one side seeking progress and the other seeking to obstruct it. According to the reporter's information, the Kuomintang army has captured several villages near Baojiaji, including the more important Gaowangji (ten li north of Baojiaji). The reporter heard two officials say, "Today's situation is that the Kuomintang army has made slight progress, and the communist situation has not changed." Currently, the situation on the southern front is that the right wing has reached the opposite bank of Xiawatuanji on the northern bank of the Xie River and the Gaowangji-Chenji (nearby) line, while the left wing is maneuvering westward from the area east of Baojiaji to the south side of Renheji. The entire defensive position resembles an inverted and reversed "了" character. In this state, the Kuomintang army's right wing seems to be slightly protruding, so the communist army is holding Baojiaji firmly, not only hindering the Kuomintang army's left wing but also preventing the right wing from continuing to advance. Looking at the overall situation, the development of the southern front seems to depend on strengthening combat effectiveness, and the authorities are actively deploying troops for this purpose.</p>

<p>[United Press, Nanjing, 14th] The communist troops under Liu Bocheng and Chen Yi are engaging with all their might in the war northwest of Bengbu, but from all perspectives, they have encountered strong resistance from the Kuomintang army and have been stopped. Liu Bocheng's troops have mobilized all their forces, not only their cadres but also those who have received half-training and rural laborers, and have deployed them to the battlefield to fiercely attack the Kuomintang army's Huang Wei Corps. But Huang Wei's corps has repelled the communist army's offensive, but does not have sufficient strength to break out. At the same time, the Kuomintang army's Li Yannian Corps advancing north from Bengbu has reached ten miles southeast of Shuangduiji. The distance between the Huang and Li corps is only five miles. The mechanized units assisting Li's corps are advancing step by step towards the communist troops surrounding Huang's corps, under air cover.</p>
<p>The Bengbu-Xuzhou Pacification Headquarters announced on the 14th: The communist army attacking Li Mi's corps under General Du Yuming has used Soviet-made tanks. Four of these tanks have been seen on the battlefield. This is the first time the communist army has used Soviet-made tanks to attack the Kuomintang army.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Nanjing, 14th] Military sources report: General Qiu Qingquan's Second Army Corps has broken through the communist army's encirclement between Xuzhou and Suxian and reached Xiangcheng in southern Henan.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Bengbu, 14th] Military sources report: (1) Our frontline Kuomintang army has made new progress again today. According to the Pacification Headquarters, our Du Yuming's corps, since the 13th, annihilated the attacking communist bandits in the Weilu-Sunge area on the northern front and are now advancing south. The bandits entrenched in the two major strongholds of Lilou and Guolou are showing signs of wavering. (2) The remaining bandits trapped in Lilou and Guolou, in order to save their crisis, actually released poison gas against our attacking troops. Fortunately, we had early precautions, so there was no major damage. The Kuomintang army soldiers are extremely resentful of the bandits' inhumane behavior, so their morale is even more boosted, and the attack is even more fierce. The bandits in the two strongholds will be completely annihilated. (3) Chen Yi's 3rd, 7th, 9th, Luzhongnan columns, and Chen Geng's 9th column and the rebel troops of Wu Huawen and He Qili, etc., have been defeated by our corps marching south from Xuzhou and are currently fleeing to the areas of Suixikou, Miaogiao, and Zhongji northwest of Suxian to reorganize.</p>
<p>[Another Telegram] About 5,000 communist bandits from the 21st and 34th Brigades attacked our four strongholds of Guandian, Zhanglaoying, Jiashan, and Xiaowangying on the morning of the 12th. Our 3rd Traffic Police Corps (279th), under the command of Lieutenant General Zhou Weilong, severely defeated the attacking bandits head-on. From 6 am to 2 pm, the bandits were mostly defeated, with an estimated more than 1,000 bandits killed. At the same time, a division of our Kuomintang army stationed in Shaheji, Chuxian, also dispatched a unit, and at 4 pm that afternoon, annihilated a regiment of bandits in Xiaowangying. After the two groups of bandits were jointly suppressed by our traffic police corps and a division of the Kuomintang army, more than two-thirds were killed or wounded, and the remaining remnants took advantage of the thick fog at night to flee.</p>

<p>[Our Correspondent in Jiangdu, 14th] The Kuomintang army, launching from Yangzhou westward, after entering Dayiji, pursued the fleeing bandits along the Yang (zhou)-Tian (chang) line westward to Qinlan, and swept northward to encircle and suppress them, successfully recovering Yangzhou Dam. It will not be difficult to annihilate the bandits in the Yangzhou-Yizheng-Tianchang triangle area soon.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Zhenjiang, 14th] The communist bandits in northern Jiangsu have been severely defeated by our powerful Kuomintang army in Baoying in recent days and have collapsed and retreated. The Kuomintang army has advanced to the Jieshou area, sixty li north of Baoying, and the situation is extremely peaceful. Tomorrow morning, the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Zhenjiang-Gaoyou line will officially resume operation. The remaining bandits in the Tianchang area have also been suppressed by the Kuomintang army and have fled to the shores of Gaoyou Lake, not daring to act rashly. We are continuing our advance.</p>

<p>[Our Correspondent in Xi'an, 14th] According to people coming from eastern Shaanxi, the morale of the communist bandits has been low after suffering several losses in Guanzhong. They are unable to launch further attacks and, knowing that there is nothing they can do, have changed their deployment. The four columns of bandits that had been assembled near Heyang have crossed north of the civilians to southern Shanxi. Other field troops may also be transferred, leaving only the bandit chieftain Wang Zhen in Shaanxi to command scattered bandits and local communists, engaging in harassment to cover up their defeat.</p>

<p>[Our Correspondent in Nantong, 14th] To prevent bandits from taking advantage of civilian ships to cross the river, a naval patrol team stationed on the river surface from Nantong, Chongming, Hai'an, and Qidong has stipulated that all ships (including sailboats and small steamers) are absolutely prohibited from sailing at night on the river below Tiensheng Port, Nantong. Any violation will result in the ship being sunk.</p>

On the morning of the 14th, he inspected various ports on the north and south banks of the Yangtze River here and returned to Nanjing that evening. He said that the river defense is solid and that it is impossible for bandits to cross the river secretly. As for the Bohai Sea, it is entirely under naval control. The rumors that Lin's communist bandits in the Northeast are secretly crossing to Shandong are purely rumors, because the bandits only have sailboats in that area, which cannot be used in the Bohai Sea.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 15th] Naval sources report: The port and bay areas of Lianyungang are still under the strict control of our navy.</p>

<p>He Will Submit a Report to the U.S. Government Recommending the Dispatch of American Generals to Train the Kuomintang Army</p>
<p>[United Press, San Francisco, 14th] Former U.S. Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Bullitt, who represented the Joint Committee of the Two Houses to China for investigation, arrived here on the evening of the 13th. He will transfer to Washington. Bullitt refused to comment on the details of the trip. He reiterated that he would not make any statements before submitting a report to the committee, but it was learned from reliable sources that Bullitt had received the following information in China and elsewhere: President Chiang had been willing to accept several senior American military generals in the past two years to make them fully responsible for training the Chinese army. It is generally believed that Bullitt's report will include this information, that is, President Chiang had already pointed out to the U.S. government that he would be willing to accept Generals MacArthur, Wedemeyer, or Clark to guide the Kuomintang army in fighting the communists. It is hoped that his report will clearly state that President Chiang will fight the communists to the end. It is said that Bullitt firmly believes that President Chiang is the only Chinese political figure with sufficient strength to unify China, and that a coalition government is practically impossible to establish.</p>

<p>Father Gorman Said</p>
<p>[Associated Press, New York, 13th] Father Gorman, who returned from a three-month inspection in China, said here today that the Chinese civil war may be a prelude to the Third World War. Communism is the deadly enemy of Christianity. If the communist army controls all of China, Christianity will be trampled on. The situation in Outer Mongolia and the three eastern provinces can serve as a lesson. Once communism spreads to China, one-fifth of mankind will be dominated by it, and American security and world peace and equilibrium will be undermined. Americans should urge President Truman to immediately encourage and support the Chinese people to fight to the death against the communist aggressors, just as we aided China in resisting the Japanese invaders. The sudden advice of the U.S. Embassy and consulates in China to all American citizens to evacuate is too extreme.</p>

<p>[Associated Press, Qingdao, 14th] The 5,500 U.S. Marines currently stationed in Qingdao, led by Major General Thomas, a veteran of the Guadalcanal campaign, are awaiting their next action. Some of them may be heading to Shanghai. The U.S. military here uses Shandong University as its main barracks. The main problem now is how to install heating equipment to ward off the cold winter. The Kuomintang army's defense line is about 25 miles from the city. The city's police and garrison tasks are all undertaken by Chinese military and police. The U.S. military only protects its own barracks and naval facilities. Since April, there have been no incidents between the U.S. military and the communists. U.S. Navy and Marine Corps officers here believe that the communists will not create trouble and lightly start a conflict with the U.S. side. A responsible naval officer said that if "something happens, the Navy has enough ships and aircraft to evacuate the Marines and Navy personnel.</p>

<h3 id="e15">Madame Chiang's Trip to America <a href="#e15" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c15" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">15</a></h3>
<p>— Special Correspondent Mao Shuqing from New York</p>
<p>The special plane "Holy Cow" brought Madame Chiang from California to Washington. On the morning of December 1st, the Washington National Airport was crowded with groups of reporters. Madame Chiang, showing signs of fatigue, stepped off the plane. Ambassador Gu was the first to step forward to shake her hand in welcome. A young and beautiful girl, whom they called "Judy Wang," presented Madame Chiang with a bouquet of flowers. In the short minutes of the hustle and bustle, the impression was vivid enough.</p>
<p>Mrs. Marshall initially sat in the airport lounge. She squeezed through the crowd and called out "Hello" to Madame Chiang! All American newspapers highlighted this point, because Mrs. Marshall was the only representative "selected" from the current Truman administration to welcome Madame Chiang. Needless to say, Truman himself would not come to the airport to greet her. Neither Mrs. Truman nor his daughter came. Even Marshall himself, quickly using "medical check-up" as an excuse, slipped into Washington's "Walter Reed" Hospital to avoid it. Deputy Secretary of State Lovett also did not come. As for others, no senators or congressmen were to be seen, not even a shadow.</p>
<p>Madame Chiang's heart was filled with sadness, even more "uncomfortable" than Shen Baoxu, the Chu state official more than two thousand years ago. Shen Baoxu's wailing in the Qin court was the first time in his life for him personally, while Madame Chiang today came to Washington for the sake of the country and endured all kinds of "embarrassments." Although the starting point was similar to Shen Baoxu's, from her personal perspective, it was not something an ordinary woman could handle. Only six short years had passed. On the same day six years ago, at the same airport, Madame Chiang was treated like a "treasure" by the American government and public. Six years later today, it was still the same Madame Chiang, but she encountered such an embarrassing coldness.</p>
<p>All the American newspapers used the word "coldness" to describe Madame Chiang's "Qin court" trip. A leftist Chinese newspaper in New York said that Madame Chiang was "eating cold soup." Truman was usually vague about everything, but he was decisive on the Chinese issue, and his attitude was very arrogant. After the election results were announced, Truman was vacationing on the Florida coast. At that time, the situation in China began to reverse. Some Republican members of Congress advocated for emergency appropriations, and some advocated for a special session of Congress, but Truman ignored them all. He wore a half-sleeved shirt and did his "soft exercises" on the beach. At that time, Marshall was in Paris. Shanghai telegrams transmitted by the Associated Press and United Press said that Marshall had promised Wang Shijie in Paris to guarantee increased aid to China. This was truly a miracle. Later, when Marshall returned to Washington, I asked Marshall about it in person at a press conference, and he completely denied it. (Continued on page four)</p>

<h3 id="e16">Editorial: Starting with the Atlantic Pact <a href="#e16" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c16" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">16</a></h3>
<p>After the unsatisfactory conclusion of the United Nations General Assembly, the international situation has become even more serious. How the United States will cope with future developments is being closely watched by the world. According to a dispatch from Agence France-Presse in Washington on the 13th, President Truman, Secretary of State Marshall, and congressional leaders Vandenberg and Connally all advocated that the United States should strengthen its assistance to Western European countries under the Marshall Plan and the Atlantic Pact, thereby promoting the unity of Western European countries. At the same time, the U.S. National Security Council also held the same view and believed that once the Atlantic Pact was signed, negotiations on the conclusion of a Mediterranean defense treaty would be conducted to establish a global security system to jointly defend against Soviet aggression.</p>
<p>From this report, it is not difficult to see the following facts: (1) The Truman Doctrine and the Marshall Plan are still the backbone of the United States' future foreign policy. In other words, the United States' old tune of "anti-communism and defense against the Soviet Union" remains unchanged. (2) The focus of American diplomatic activities is still in Europe. In other words, no matter how serious the crisis in Asia is, Marshall's policy of "Europe first, Asia second" will remain unchanged. Regardless of whether the Atlantic Pact and the Mediterranean Pact can be realized as desired by the American diplomatic authorities, we cannot help but be skeptical about whether the conclusion of these two pacts constitutes the establishment of a global security system.</p>
<p>The concept of organizing the Atlantic Group originated during World War II. The British and American governments and people all held supportive attitudes towards this new international movement, but it ultimately failed to materialize because people yearned for the prospect of "One World." At that time, the famous American journalist Walter Lippmann wrote articles advocating it and put forward a concrete proposal. He advocated that the countries participating in the Atlantic Group should include countries in North and South America and European countries such as Britain, France, the Netherlands, Belgium, Luxembourg, Denmark, Portugal, Spain, Switzerland, Greece, Italy, and Iceland. Even the Union of South Africa in Africa, and countries in the Pacific such as Australia, New Zealand, and the Philippines, should all participate. Today, the American diplomatic authorities want to organize Mediterranean joint defense after the Atlantic Pact, which is the practice of Lippmann's proposal to promote the realization of the Atlantic Group through the two pacts.</p>
<p>These two pacts are currently being negotiated in Washington. From the perspective of current practical needs, they are indeed jointly needed by countries on both sides of the Atlantic. For Western Europe, if it wants to resist the communist forces from Eastern Europe invading Western Europe today, it must rely on the economic and military assistance of the United States and Canada. And for the United States, for the sake of anti-communism and defense against the Soviet Union, it also needs to move its defense line to Western European countries. Therefore, we predict that the negotiations in Washington will definitely proceed very smoothly and a satisfactory result can be reached soon. At the same time, we can also assert that the conclusion of these two pacts will definitely have a great impact on resisting international aggression and promoting world peace.</p>
<p>However, from the perspective of the entire world, whether the Atlantic Pact and the Mediterranean Pact can achieve their task of defending world peace is a serious question. Because world peace is indivisible, even if the countries on both sides of the Atlantic can unite like iron and jointly resist international aggression, so as to maintain local peace and security, as long as there is turmoil and unrest or war elsewhere one day, the Atlantic will not have the possibility of surviving safely. The lessons of history are valuable and most worthy of deep reflection by politicians and diplomats of various countries. Taking the current international situation as an example, Western European countries can survive for a while under the Marshall Plan and the Western European Pact. Now adding icing on the cake and concluding an Atlantic Pact seems to make them feel even more secure, but looking at the situation in Asia, from Southeast Asia to China, and from China to Northeast Asia, there is no place that does not show the seriousness of the Asian crisis. And the United States insists on implementing the policy of "Europe first, Asia second," and even regards the anti-communist vanguard—China—as almost insignificant, and sits idly by as Asia sinks. The United States may still think it is a good plan at the moment, thinking that the Atlantic Pact can guarantee world peace, but it does not know that "Europe first, Asia second" will inevitably lead to a historical mistake, and it will eventually swallow the bitter fruit, and the Atlantic Pact and the Mediterranean Pact will also lose their meaning. The lessons of history must not be ignored!</p>
<p>Politicians talk about reality, and diplomats especially need to pay attention to reality. Now that the Atlantic Pact is being negotiated in Washington, we hope that the politicians and diplomats in Washington can face reality, not be stubborn, have no prejudices, and re-establish a global security system. The people of Asia are all looking forward to the next action in Washington!</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 14th] The 28th meeting of the second session of the Legislative Yuan was held on the 14th. The meeting opened at 9:30 in the morning. The President and Vice President were absent due to various reasons. Lei Yin was elected as the chairman. After passing the minutes of the previous meeting, Zhao Huimo and Luo Heng reported on their visit to Bengbu to comfort the troops. Then, temporary motions were dealt with: (1) Guang Lu and 112 others proposed that the assembly send a telegram in the name of the assembly to commend General Ma Hongda and all the officers and soldiers of the Ningxia Corps to encourage them. The resolution was passed. (2) Zhang Zhijiang and others proposed requesting a telegram to urge President Sun to return to Beijing immediately to form a responsible cabinet, start work, and reverse the crisis. Committee member Wu Shangying explained that Sun had already been discharged from the hospital with illness and was scheduled to go to Beijing on the 15th to take over the matter. Most committee members believed that there was no need to send a telegram to urge him, and the resolution was postponed to the next regular meeting for discussion. The meeting members debated this motion for a long time and adjourned at noon. The meeting continued at 3:30 in the afternoon. Temporary motions: (3) Zhao Zhenzhou and others proposed improving the current method of gold and silver exchange to avoid manipulation and control by a few people, leading to sudden wealth. The resolution was submitted to the Finance and Finance Committee for review. Then, the agenda items listed for discussion were carried out. The first case was the report of the Legal System and Border Affairs Committee on the review of the proposal by Wu Yunpeng and others to accommodate Mongolian exiles, assist in the promotion of Mongolian administration, strengthen the suppression of chaos, and stabilize the hearts of the Mongolian people. It was proposed to temporarily establish a Mongolian Counseling Group in the Mongolian and Tibetan Committee. The resolution was based on the review opinions to amend the draft organizational regulations of the Mongolian Counseling Group to establish the Organizational Regulations of the Committee for Employment and Education Counseling for Exiled Mongolians of the Mongolian and Tibetan Committee, which was passed after three readings. The second case was the report of the Health and Legal System Committee on the review of Articles 8, 9, and 13 of the Organizational Regulations of the Black Fever Prevention and Control Office of the Ministry of Health. The resolution was passed as is. The third case was the report of the Social and Legal System Committee on the review of the draft amendment to the Organizational Law of the Ministry of Social Affairs. Some committee members raised opinions on the duties of the various departments and bureaus of the Ministry of Social Affairs, believing that since there was already a Workers' Cooperative Labor Bureau in the ministry, it was a redundant organization and there was no need to establish it. If the bureau was a temporary agency, it should not be included in the regular Organizational Law. Some committee members also pointed out that the amendments to the names of some departments in the review opinions were inappropriate. The discussion was adjourned at around 5 o'clock. When it was planned to continue the meeting at 5:30, the meeting place suddenly lost power and the meeting could not proceed, so it was adjourned. The third case and the remaining cases that were not discussed were all postponed to the next regular meeting for discussion.</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper, Changsha, 14th] Changsha's method of exchanging gold and silver has changed greatly. On the 13th, it was the turn of public educators to apply for deposits and exchanges, but scalpers infiltrated the designated location for issuing application forms, and a large number of them stood guard at night. Later, the line lengthened and the number of people reached tens of thousands. The authorities, fearing an incident, temporarily announced a suspension. The Provincial Government held a meeting on the evening of the 13th and decided that citizens and public educators would be handled separately on a technical level. Citizens would be calculated according to population, and registers would be created by the baojia, and identity cards would be used to lead the team by the baojia chief and deposit and exchange in turn. Public educators would have registers created by each agency and sent to the Central Bank to receive application forms, which would be filled out and then cash would be advanced by the agency from each employee's salary and distributed at once. Deposit and exchange will be temporarily suspended from the 14th, and will be restored after the above method has been discussed and properly resolved. In addition, the Provincial Government has formulated separate laws to restrict people from carrying silver dollars out of the country to deal with silver dollar dealers. Chairman Cheng instructed that anyone caught engaging in large-scale speculative purchases would be shot, and the main agencies for secretly buying silver dollars would be strictly searched. Once the principal offenders are caught, the garrison department is allowed to execute them on the spot.</p>

Furthermore, the municipal government decided to abolish the in-kind tax levy on suburban areas and uniformly levy land value tax, calculated based on an index, which was also amended and passed, to the great satisfaction of the people.</p>

<h3 id="e45">The United States Considers Re-arming Japan: Establishing a Police Force of 150,000 to Cope with the Current Drastic Changes in the Far East Situation <a href="#e45" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c45" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">45</a></h3>
<p>[United Press Washington Thirteenth Dispatch] Well-informed sources in the defense sector told United Press on the thirteenth that the United States is considering establishing an armed police force of 100,000 to 150,000 men in Japan. They stated that, from a military perspective, the United States' Far East policy does not plan to make drastic changes, but it is gradually evolving to prevent Japan from becoming a vacuum after the withdrawal of the occupation forces. The first formal consideration of this matter by the United States was based on Lieutenant General Eichelberger's endorsement of Japan forming a 125,000-man armed police force after returning from Japan. Subsequently, the situation in China deteriorated, raising new questions regarding the United States' policy in Asia, and leading to consideration of organizing a Japanese security force. However, well-informed sources in the defense sector insisted that there are no plans for drastic changes. They pointed out that all occupation forces in Japan are mandated by policy to disarm Japan, and the Japanese constitution also stipulates that Japan complete disarmament. However, Japan can maintain a certain amount of military force within its territory for police purposes and maintaining order. On the other hand, it is stated that the planned Japanese force of 150,000 men would not conflict with policy or the constitution. It is rumored that a few months ago, MacArthur endorsed providing the Chinese government with a large amount of army supplies unused by the occupation forces. However, the current situation has changed, and inventory that was considered surplus or unusable a few months ago is now regarded as important for defense. For example, parts for C-54 aircraft have been taken from the inventory stockpile for use. Given the changing situation, according to unconfirmed reports, MacArthur has requested strong reinforcements and asked US policy makers to consider arming Japan. It is not yet known whether the National Security Council is considering this policy. The decisions of the committee are highly confidential, and even if a decision has been made, it will not be announced. However, sources at a lower level than the committee stated that the United States is proceeding with preparations for an armed Japanese force. These sources all stated that when the occupation forces withdraw from Japan, Japan obviously cannot be without a military force. Therefore, Japan needs to establish and train a strong and well-disciplined military force. These sources also carefully pointed out that neither the US State Department nor the National Security Council can decide on US policy. President Truman and Congress may repeal the policies and orders of both and re-formulate the entire Far East policy. Based on past trends, Truman and Congress often listen to the advice of the State Department and the War Department.</p>
<p>[United Press Tokyo Fourteenth Dispatch] US officials here revealed on the fourteenth that the Japanese police have already expanded to the authorized limit of 125,000 men. This limit has been criticized by China and the Soviet Union as a "new army," but the United States considers it insufficient. Allied headquarters officials declined to comment on news from Washington. According to that news, the United States is considering expanding the Japanese police and arming them to a sufficient extent.</p>

<p>[United Press Paris Thirteenth Dispatch] UN General Assembly President Evatt stated on the thirteenth that the East-West tension has eased, but warned that "neglecting the Far East and the Pacific region is a great mistake, because the crisis in that region is currently quite acute." Evatt condemned the disputes among major powers as the cause of the failure of the Paris conference. He also emphasized the need to swiftly conclude peace treaties with Japan, Germany, and Austria, considering this a step towards bringing peace to the world.</p>
<p>In a written statement to reporters in the almost abandoned Chaillot Palace assembly hall, Evatt stated, "Due to the convening of the UN General Assembly, the tension among major powers in September has eased. However, the patient's temperature has not yet returned to normal, but the fever has subsided. The second half of the session will be held in New York on April 1st next year, instead of being postponed until the fall, in order to prevent the rifts among the major powers from deepening and causing war. Of course, all people around the world do not want war. Although the United Nations and all its procedures are not the only help in promoting peace treaties with Germany and Austria, they are at least the best way."</p>

<h3 id="e53">A Major Political Storm in Japan: Finance Minister Izumiyama, Drunk, Molests Two Female Legislators: Majority of Legislators Demand Resignation of Yoshida Cabinet <a href="#e53" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c53" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">53</a></h3>
<p>[United Press Tokyo Fourteenth Dispatch] Due to Finance Minister Izumiyama's "drunken molestation" of two female legislators on the evening of the thirteenth, a majority of Japanese legislators decided on the fourteenth to demand the total resignation of the Yoshida cabinet. As public opinion seethed over the public accusation by one of the "insulted" women, Izumiyama resigned from his post as Finance Minister on the morning of the fourteenth and resigned from his seat in the afternoon, just as a special parliamentary committee was about to expel him.</p>
<p>When Shigeru Yoshida came to power two months ago, he declared that he would eradicate "scandals" in the government so that Japan could be respected by the international community. His opposition party has quickly seized this heaven-sent opportunity. Izumiyama did not defend himself, but said that his wife remained unwavering in her belief in him. He was still hungover and slightly unwell on the fourteenth. Due to the major storm caused by the Izumiyama case, the supplementary budget of 70 billion yen and the no-confidence motion proposed by the opposition party on the thirteenth were shelved.</p>

<p>The No-Confidence Motion Against the Cabinet Is Shelved Instead</p>
<p>[United Press Tokyo Fourteenth Dispatch] Fifty-two-year-old Japanese Finance Minister Izumiyama Sangō resigned from his cabinet post on the morning of the fourteenth. Yoshida accepted the resignation and temporarily appointed Minister of Commerce and Industry Oya Shinzō as acting Finance Minister and Minister of Agriculture and Forestry Shūtō Hideo as acting Director-General of the Economic Stabilization Board. Due to Izumiyama's drunkenness, his inability to attend meetings, and the accusations of female legislators against his "improper behavior," the parliamentary agenda for discussing the 70 billion yen subsidy budget was delayed. Although members of the House of Representatives had been meeting overnight in the Diet Building, many members, exhausted from the all-night meeting, remained in the Diet Building until 10:00 am on the fourteenth, sleeping on chairs and desks. The opposition declared that the budget must be passed before they would vote on a no-confidence motion against the Yoshida cabinet. The opposition party and the government are still arguing over the new base salary for civil servants. The former advocates raising the base salary of civil servants to 6,307 yen, while the government only advocates increasing it to 5,330 yen. At the same time, Yoshida reiterated his determination to dissolve the Diet and let the people decide. According to general indications, the Diet will be dissolved on the fifteenth so that a general election can be held in January next year.</p>

<p>Mrs. Yamashita spoke vividly</p>
<p>[United Press Tokyo Fourteenth Dispatch] Mrs. Yamashita (47 years old), one of the two female legislators who were "molested," was summoned to attend a parliamentary committee report in the afternoon of the fourteenth. She reported that Izumiyama entered the Diet dining room at 6:00 pm on the thirteenth and immediately shouted at the waiter. I felt he was a bit reckless. He quickly poured down two cups of rice wine. A vice-minister entered, and Izumiyama toasted with him. Later, Izumiyama sat next to me and said, "It's too stuffy here. Let's go outside." He dragged me into the corridor. I asked him, "What are you doing?" Izumiyama replied, "There's no one here." Then he forcibly hugged me, and then he behaved recklessly. I can't say it here. Before that, I told him that people in the government were busy with the new salary base and the supplementary budget, and that he shouldn't be getting drunk. But he said, "Don't worry about that, let's go find a place." He didn't listen to me. Mrs. Yamashita also told the committee, "Up until now, I have only met Izumiyama twice. This case not only affects our fifteen legislators, but it is also closely related to all women in Japan. The reason why we ran for election was to protect all women from being trampled on by people like Izumiyama. Some people say that I was also drunk, but I reported Izumiyama's molestation in the Diet last night, which proves that I was not drunk."</p>
<p>The other "insulted" woman, Mrs. Matsuo (41 years old), told reporters that Izumiyama had tightly held her hand. However, she said, "I don't want to make a fuss. Of course, I think there should be etiquette between male and female legislators, but I don't want to make a report like Mrs. Yamashita. As I see it, aren't most men like Izumiyama?"</p>
<h3 id="e56">Arab Countries' Tendency to Split over the Holy Land Issue Becomes Overt: Egypt and Other Countries Oppose Transjordan's Annexation of the Holy Land: Transjordan Conducts Peace Negotiations with Israel <a href="#e56" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c56" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">56</a></h3>
<p>[United Press Beirut Fourteenth Dispatch] The possible split among Arab countries over the Palestinian issue became overt on the fourteenth. Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Syria, and Lebanon are united in opposing Transjordan's annexation of the eastern part of the Holy Land. The Transjordan parliament announced on the fourteenth that King Abdullah will be "King of the United Kingdom of Transjordan and Palestine" and has taken steps to include Palestinian Arabs in the Transjordan cabinet in Amman.</p>
<p>The Iraqi parliament is scheduled to hold an emergency meeting on the fourteenth to decide whether Iraq will support Abdullah or join other Arab countries, as the ruler of Iraq is a relative of King Abdullah. Transjordan officials apparently attach importance to Iraq's position, as Iraqi troops occupy part of the territory annexed by Abdullah. If Iraq opposes the annexation, Transjordan will stand alone against all other countries in the Arab League. According to a dispatch from Amman, Transjordan officials said that they were deeply saddened by the attitude of Egypt, Saudi Arabia, and Syria. They believe that annexation is the best path for Palestinian Arabs. The exact areas of Palestine annexed by King Abdullah have not yet been determined, but it is reported that they include the entire Arab Palestine. However, the areas occupied by the Arab Legion are only the central part of Eastern Palestine, while Egyptian troops occupy the southern part. Another dispatch states that King Abdullah has instructed the Prime Minister of Transjordan to expand his cabinet to accommodate Palestinian Arabs and concentrate on sending Arab refugees back to their hometowns. The cabinet will prepare to hold elections in Palestine to elect members to participate in the Transjordan parliament. At the same time, Transjordan is conducting armistice and permanent peace negotiations with Israel.

<p>[Report from this newspaper] Paris, 14th dispatch: The Mediation Committee reported to the Security Council that leaders of the Indonesian Republic requested the committee to advise the Dutch government to seek a peaceful resolution.

<p>[Central News Agency, Yogyakarta, 13th dispatch, United Press] The Indonesian Republic calmly awaits Dutch military action, which is expected to continue within six weeks.

Informed sources say the Dutch may launch a full-scale offensive before Christmas, but the imminent arrival of the UN Mediation Committee is likely to reduce the possibility of such action occurring sooner.</p>
<p>[United Press, Amsterdam, 13th dispatch] The left-wing newspaper "Het Parool" predicted on the 13th that war was inevitable in Indonesia before Christmas and called on the United States to mediate the Dutch-Indonesian dispute.

<h3 id="e66">Supervisory Committee Branch Sends Personnel to Review Accounts; Suspicion of Favoritism in Gold Exchange Discovered; Over Two Thousand Taels Exchanged Without Queuing <a href="#e66" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c66" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">66</a></h3>
<p>Expresses Determination to Thoroughly Investigate the Rice-for-Cotton Cloth Swap Case</p>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] Yesterday, reporters visited the Jiangsu and Zhejiang Supervisory Committee Branch to inquire about the two major cases recently investigated by the branch: the Central Bank's handling of gold deposits and exchanges, and the limited-price period rice-for-cotton cloth swap. Supervisor Ni Bi and Branch Secretary Wang Yawu informed us that regarding the suspicion of corruption in the National Bank's gold deposits and exchanges, personnel had been sent three times to conduct on-site investigations. A review of the accounts revealed that National Bank employees had exchanged over two thousand taels of gold without queuing. As for the alleged irregularities in the distribution of application forms by the Central Bank on the 10th of this month as reported in various newspapers, it was found that the first application form was issued to an employee of the Bank of China, and the third was given to a student, possibly due to favoritism by the gatekeeper, who provided convenience to relatives and friends. As for other rumors of bank employees colluding with large clients and secretly collecting handling fees, no evidence has yet been obtained, and the branch will continue to investigate.</p>
<p>Regarding the rice-for-cotton cloth swap case, the branch has appointed an investigation team led by Zhang Zhengzong to conduct an investigation and will visit relevant agencies in the coming days for inquiries. Secretary Wang emphasized that rice is a necessity for people's livelihood, and its supply can affect the stability of social order. The branch has the power to exercise supervisory powers, and the inside story of this case is complex and intriguing. It is the duty of the branch to thoroughly investigate, reveal the whole truth to the public, and, if there is indeed evidence of corruption, submit it to the Supervisory Yuan for strict investigation. The Central Bank and the China Textile Construction Company will be notified that all cotton cloth will be suspended from allocation until the entire case is clarified. At the same time, during the limited-price period, organs, schools, citizens, etc., in this city stored rice at rice shops. Subsequently, some rice shops used the excuse of being snapped up to forcibly settle payments in cash at limited prices. The Supervisory Committee has received many complaints of this kind, and it is now planned to investigate them all thoroughly.</p>
<p>The Rice Merchants Association sent representatives, including Yin Fuxiang, and more than ten others to the Textile Construction Company around 4:00 p.m. on the 14th to request that the 20,000 bolts of cotton cloth be allowed to be picked up. Deputy General Manager Wu Weijing met with them. According to Mr. Wu, the National Bank had promised to allocate cotton yarn at a limited price for the cotton cloth at that time, but the National Bank has not yet allocated the cotton yarn, so it is not convenient to allow the cotton cloth to be picked up. A final decision can be made after he consults with the National Bank.</p>

<p>Because the modified methods for gold and silver deposits and exchanges have not yet been announced, the exchange situation yesterday was unprecedentedly crowded. From 4:30 a.m., tens of thousands of people lined up in front of the Central Bank, Bank of China, Bank of Communications, and Farmers Bank of China. The situation was particularly tense at the Central Bank and Bank of Communications. Groups of local ruffians and scalpers were mixed in, and the order was chaotic, leading to fights. In front of the Central Bank, Lu Yougen, Zhuang Yixia, and Mao Xuerong were injured. In front of the Bank of Communications, Chen Ruilin, Zhou Zhunian, and Wang Afu were injured. All were taken to Renji Hospital for treatment. The police局 deployed three squadrons of flying fortresses to the scene to suppress the situation and arrested several suspects involved.

<p>[Report from this newspaper] The newly appointed Director Bi Delin of the Gold Control Bureau of this city officially assumed office at 9:00 a.m. yesterday. Shi Shouchang, Director of the Goods Tax Bureau dispatched by the Ministry of Finance, supervised the event, and there were many well-wishers from the financial and industrial and commercial circles. Mr. Bi stated that everything would be done in accordance with laws and regulations in the future to strive for financial stability. The bureau is paying close attention to the current outflow of funds, the black market for gold and banknotes, and the sale of silver dollars, and will take new measures. Furthermore, according to government laws and regulations, people are allowed to hold gold, silver, silver coins, and foreign currency, but only silver coins are allowed to circulate and be bought and sold. The permission for silver bars to circulate and be bought and sold is to facilitate payment and exchange and the use of large amounts of gold yuan certificates, and not to use silver coins as a tool for profit. The current silver dollar transactions on the market are clearly in violation of the above regulations. The Gold Control Bureau has been ordered to ban all black markets for gold, banknotes, and silver dollars, and will strictly enforce this in conjunction with relevant agencies.</p>

<h3 id="e77">Frontline Comfort Mission Returns to Shanghai from Nanjing; Firmly Believes that the Battle Will Definitely Achieve Brilliant Results <a href="#e77" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c77" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">77</a></h3>
<p>[Central News Agency] The Shanghai Municipal All-Circles Comfort Mission to the Frontline Soldiers returned to Shanghai yesterday afternoon after completing its mission of comforting the troops on the Bengbu front. This reporter accompanied the mission to visit the war zone and witnessed the strong and vigorous morale and loyal patriotic spirit of the National Army on the front lines. It is firmly believed that the Battle of Suxian-Bengbu will definitely achieve brilliant results, and the Huai River will surely become the graveyard of the Chinese Communist bandits. This battle will also reflect the Battle of Fei River, which shines in the history books. At the forefront of North China, this reporter personally witnessed the National Army bravely charging and killing with superior firepower, defeating a regiment of Chen Yi's bandits in one hour. In the process of suppressing the bandits, Chiang Wei-kuo, the President's second son and Chief of Staff, personally led his tank unit to charge at high speed, achieving the task of coordinating infantry to advance forward. Mr. Chiang's personal command on the front lines gave the soldiers great encouragement.</p>
<p>Commander Li Yannian told reporters in a firm tone on the front lines that the National Army will definitely win the battle in the Huaibei battlefield. He pointed out that since the beginning of the battle, under the correct strategic guidance, the National Army has eliminated most of the Communist bandits' main combat forces and disintegrated the Communist bandits' fragile combat will. The current bandits have become shaken, and many have surrendered with their weapons in recent days, which is in stark contrast to our strong morale. The elite troops led by Division Commander Liu Cuigao, who had just retreated from the Northeast, have rushed to the north bank of the Huai River and launched a fierce offensive to accelerate the convergence of the Northern Expeditionary Army and Huang Wei's Corps. All officers and soldiers of the division have strong fighting spirit. Most of the National Army on the Huaibei front are veterans who have experienced hundreds of battles and are very interested in the strict military life. Their national consciousness is particularly strong. The visit of the Comfort Mission from Nanjing and Shanghai to comfort the troops on the front lines made the battlefield full of gunpowder reveal human warmth, and the officers and soldiers were even more encouraged. The frontline soldiers are willing to win continuous victories to earn continuous comfort, and the people in the rear are willing to use continuous comfort to welcome continuous victories.</p>
<p>Commander-in-Chief Liu Zhi said in his speech in thanks to the Comfort Mission that he is determined to win a comprehensive victory in suppressing the bandits and repay the material and spiritual comfort of the compatriots in the rear. He also called on the compatriots in Nanjing and Shanghai to eliminate pessimistic and defeatist sentiments and fully support the war against the bandits, and the future can definitely be optimistic.</p>

<p>[Report from this newspaper] Regarding the issue of responsibility for the Jiangya Steamer disaster, the District Prosecutor's Office specially appointed two prosecutors, Cao Hong and Yu Bingyao, to investigate. Yesterday, the two prosecutors Cao and Yu went to the sinking site of the Jiangya Steamer outside Wusongkou for inspection. The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company specially prepared the Jian Steamer for transportation. Those accompanying the inspection included Chu Shun, Zheng Lintong, Xia Gongkai, and Li Biekui from the Legal Group of the Jiangya Steamer Disaster Aftermath Committee of the Ningbo Fellow-Villagers Association; Zhuo Ziyao from the Discipline Group; Zhou Qifan from the Salvage Group; Lu Shangzheng and Zhang Fusheng, family members of the victims; and Zhu Zhicheng and Wang Liquan, survivors. Zhang Lisan, Director of the Personnel Office of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, and Fan Lun, Chief of the Maritime Affairs Section, accompanied them.

The ship set sail at 10:00 a.m. and arrived at the site of the Jiangya Steamer's accident outside Wusongkou at 2:00 p.m. Due to the rough seas yesterday, the planned investigation work could not be carried out. They only inspected the Jiangya Steamer for a week and slightly inspected it by the two prosecutors Cao and Chu. Zheng Shouye, the Business Manager of the Jiangya Steamer, and the survivors explained the circumstances of the ship's explosion and sinking at the time. Then, the steamer returned. They arrived at the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company wharf at about 6:00 p.m. It was also heard that the prosecutors will schedule another inspection when the wind and waves subside.</p>
<p>Committee Releases Work Situation</p>
<p>The Ningbo Fellow-Villagers Association Jiangya Steamer Disaster Aftermath Committee released the following work situation yesterday:</p>
<p>After the bodies salvaged from the Jiangya Steamer were transported to the Siming Public Cemetery, those identified and claimed by family members included 161 on the 12th and 180 on the 13th. For those unclaimed, 15 were collected and buried on behalf of the committee on the 12th, and 50 on the 13th, and photos were taken of each. The heroic spirit of the owner of the Jinyuanli sailboat in bravely saving people this time is admired by all the people of Shanghai. Some family members of the victims still came to the committee to provide services with grief and pain. Mr. Qiu Xingyi, a fellow villager, whose wife was killed on the Jiangya Steamer, was willing to come to the committee to provide services. He had found his wife's body the day before, claimed it, and buried it. Afterward, he continued to come to the meeting to work with grief. His righteous and courageous spirit is extremely admirable.</p>
<p>Two Hundred and Seventy-Seven Bodies Arrived Yesterday</p>

All have been transported to the Siming Public Cemetery for display and identification.</p>
<p>Yesterday (the 14th), due to the large wind and waves outside the port, the输只 could not stay, and the salvage ships had returned and anchored near the Zhabei Water and Electricity Plant to avoid the wind. As soon as the wind subsided, they would sail out to continue working.</p>
<p>Before the salvage ships sailed back to the port to avoid the wind yesterday, a female body was salvaged. It was transported to Shanghai yesterday evening.</p>
<p>Family Members of the Victims Ask for Relief</p>
<p>According to Ye Rongzhang, the leader of the relief team of the Jiangya Steamer Disaster Aftermath Committee of the Ningbo Fellow-Villagers Association in Shanghai, many family members of the dead fellow villagers have asked the team for relief in recent days. However, the team's recent funds are only enough to barely meet the needs of emergency relief, so there is no way to help them. However, it is not a good way to sit idly by and do nothing. It is hoped that the committee will establish a fundraising team and immediately mobilize to raise money or in-kind donations to start handling the aftermath relief. According to Zhou Haoran, the deputy leader of the team, the current stage of the team's relief work is limited to the victims who escaped the disaster. However, in recent days, many family members have come to the team to request the issuance of free boat tickets to escort coffins back to their hometowns or to return to their hometowns after receiving bodies from Shanghai. In order to take into account the actual situation, the team has sent personnel to verify the facts and has given them flexible processing and issued certificates.</p>

It is hoped that people from all walks of life in the city will send condolence money as much as possible. All elegiac couplets and wreaths should be sent to the General Assembly Preparatory Committee of the Friends of the Army Society at No. 180 Zhapu Road, Hongkou before the 18th of this month; all condolence money should be sent to the Trust Department of the Shanghai City Bank at No. 205 Nanjing East Road before the 18th, and the balance will be cleared and announced in the newspaper after the meeting; after the 19th, it can be sent directly to General Huang's mansion at No. 202 Jufu Road, this city, and will be personally received by Mrs. Huang.</p>
<h3 id="e80">Various Circles Held a Grand Meeting Yesterday to Welcome and Send Off the Old and New Four Commanders; Tie Wu Expressed Gratitude for the Kind Intentions and Offered Parting Words; Chen Daqing Proposed Three Points for Joint Effort <a href="#e80" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c80" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">80</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM, various circles in the city held a grand meeting at the Lido Garden to bid farewell to Commander Xuan Tiewu and welcome Commander Chen Daqing. The meeting also included a farewell to Port Commander Zhou Lixing and a welcome to the new Commander Zeng Jiqing. City leaders from all circles, including Wu Guozhen, Pan Gongzhan, Fang Zhi (represented by Xie Renzhao), Du Yuesheng, Xu Jiyin, Bu Zichang, Yu Shuping, Wei Rulin, and others, totaling over 300 people, attended. Mayor Wu Guozhen served as the Chairman of the Presidium and delivered a welcoming speech, stating briefly: In the past two and a half years, the city has experienced hundreds of crises, but thanks to the assistance and cooperation of Commander Xuan, we were able to overcome them safely. Today, Commander Xuan is honorably transferred to the new position of Deputy Director of the Quzhou Pacification Commissioner's Office, and we feel infinite reluctance to part with him. Wu expressed deep gratitude to Xuan for his past spirit of cooperation and expressed hope that Commander Chen Daqing would maintain this spirit of cooperation with all local circles at this time of greater difficulty and hardship, jointly take responsibility for maintaining the security of Shanghai, and make it as secure as a rock. Wu also praised Port Commander Zhou Lixing for his past achievements and welcomed Commander Zeng Jiqing, praising his close cooperation with all circles in relevant logistics work.</p>
<p>The Gap Between Rich and Poor Should Be Narrowed Quickly</p>
<p>Following Wu's speech, Commander Xuan expressed his gratitude for the kindness of all parties and offered parting words. He particularly pointed out that Shanghai's current relatively well-off situation is the result of the spiritual cooperation of the party, government, military, and people, and has been achieved through some storms and difficulties, not by chance. The current problems are even more serious, and he feels sorry to leave at this time, but he firmly believes that Shanghai already has a good foundation for cooperation, and by working hard on this foundation, Shanghai can continue to be stable and further stabilize the whole country. He expressed his feelings after presiding over military and police work in Shanghai for more than two years: There is no need to avoid the fact that the lifestyles of Shanghai's six million citizens today have not yet reached fairness and rationality, and there are still many gaps and conflicts of interest. If these factors are not eliminated, Shanghai will still be dangerous. He said: Due to the past economic system, there is a clear gap between the rich and poor among the people of Shanghai. At the present stage of the life-and-death struggle with the communists, this gap should be narrowed quickly. How to make six million people live in harmony and work together, coordinate and unite, and become a whole force is the goal that should be actively pursued today.</p>
<p>Stability is the First Priority</p>
<p>Today, a few people only know how to escape, but they do not know that if the dangerous factors existing in Shanghai can be eliminated first, Shanghai will be no different from an iron fortress, so why worry about the communists? He finally said that Quzhou is now the second line of defense and is closely related to Shanghai. He hopes that all circles will continue to give advice from time to time so that the second line of defense can be consolidated.</p>
<p>The newly appointed Garrison Commander Chen Daqing said in his speech how to make Shanghai's commerce continue to develop and prosper, how to make Shanghai's culture and education continue to progress, and still become the leader of the country. He contributed three points of opinion as the goal of joint efforts: (1) Labor-management cooperation to solve the current difficulties of industry and commerce; (2) To exert the correct and constructive power of public opinion and lead the people to cooperate with the government; (3) Only under the situation of consolidated security and normal order can all work be carried out, so stability is the first priority. He frankly admitted that there are still some shortcomings in the military and is making effective improvements. Then, City Councilor Speaker Pan Gongzhan delivered a speech on behalf of all circles to bid farewell and welcome. He solemnly pointed out that Commander Xuan's parting words and Commander Chen's three instructions are worthy of deep understanding and gratitude from all citizens. He listed several of Xuan's achievements in Shanghai, saying: A few sparks can start a prairie fire, and the military and police led by Xuan extinguished them in time. The people may not be aware of it because it did not start a prairie fire, but if it did, the consequences would be unimaginable? Xuan's execution of maintaining autumn order under the requirements of freedom and democracy was really not easy. Pan believed that Commander Chen would "follow the rules of Xiao and Cao" and continue to make Shanghai stable. Pan emphasized the meaning of "self-help," appealing to all Shanghai citizens to be thoroughly enlightened today, seek their own blessings, and must first have a strong popular morale in order to have a strong military morale, and must first fulfill the national duty in order to eventually achieve national freedom. Therefore, we must contribute all our strength to support the government and use the power of the people to change this situation and change the views of international people. As Hoffman and Badger said, "Only the Chinese can save China." If we can save ourselves, foreign aid will gradually flow in. Finally, Pan presented Commander Xuan with a large silver tripod, and the meeting adjourned in a warm atmosphere.</p>

<p>[Reported by this newspaper] The cotton textile associations and private yarn factories in the Su, Zhejiang, Anhui, Beijing, and Shanghai areas held an emergency meeting yesterday. Since the private yarn factories have been in charge of unified purchase, unified sales, and代纺代织, the losses this year have been considerable. In addition, during the currency reform period, the limited-price sale of yarn could not be replenished, and the damage was even greater. At present, maintaining the status quo is quite difficult, and the year-end bonus cannot be afforded. Therefore, a resolution was made on the spot: (1) To send a telegram to the Ministry of Industry and Commerce of the Executive Yuan requesting relief; (2) To appoint representatives Rong Erren, Guo Dihuo, Liu Jingji, Wang Zhuyi, Liu Piji, Lu Ziwen, Yuan Guoliang, Cheng Jingtang, Zhu Fuju, Tang Huaru and other ten people to visit Mayor Wu and Director Wu yesterday afternoon to state the actual difficulties of the current yarn factory industry and ask the government to maintain them.</p>
<h3 id="e96">Madame Chiang's Trip to the United States (Continued from the First Edition) <a href="#e96" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c96" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">96</a></h3>
<p>Some say: Madame Chiang came late this time. A month, if she had come earlier, the situation might not have been so rigid. This statement is reasonable. This time, Madame Chiang came after the Truman-Marshall talks decided on the policy. It is not convenient for the current US government to make a change easily. This is a fact. The so-called "Truman-Marshall talks" were after Truman won the election and Marshall finished his task of attending the UN General Assembly and returned with a belly full of "resentment." In order to win the votes of women and children for Truman's despicable "Vincent Incident," he did not hesitate to sacrifice the Secretary of State. Marshall came back, originally intending to erupt and erupt specially. First, he wanted to question Truman, what kind of tricks did he want to play? The second step. Then he and Secretary of Defense Forrestal resigned together.</p>
<p>However, Truman also had his own slick way. He comforted Marshall calmly, saying that Marshall was a first-class talented patriot. Marshall accepted such a series of "high hats" and finally temporarily dismissed the intention of resigning. Afterwards, Truman and Marshall began to discuss the world crisis. Truman fully supported the "Marshall Plan" to aid Europe. What about Asia? The cost is too high, let's wait and see for the time being! In this way, Truman also issued a series of statements on China policy: no loans, no sending MacArthur, evacuating overseas Chinese, and even issuing a statement that "the official did not invite Madame Chiang"!</p>
<p>Madame Chiang came one step late, but she still did not refuse to come. The American national character has a strange habit. They often show special sympathy for those who do not avoid difficulties and dangers, are not afraid of embarrassment, and struggle to the end on their own. The Truman election was an example. After Madame Chiang arrived in Washington, the Chinese Embassy received many official letters from organizations inviting Madame Chiang to give a speech. When the author wrote this message, the plan for Madame Chiang's speech had not yet been decided. Most people with insight advocated that Madame Chiang should give a public speech and tell the American people frankly from the East Coast to the West Coast about China's situation and the attitude of the Truman government so that the American people can have a fair criticism.</p>
<p>Because the Truman government's policy towards China has not been clear until now, the American media rarely mentions Madame Chiang's visit this time. Before the Truman-Marshall talks, The New York Times had repeatedly called for strengthening aid to China. After the Truman-Marshall statement was issued, deciding to continue to maintain the "no policy policy," The Times no longer spoke. Instead, a small newspaper in New York, the "New York Mirror," wrote an article severely criticizing the "State Department" after Washington showed coldness to Madame Chiang, saying that the State Department was doing confused diplomacy and that the experts in the State Department had not read the history of the Far East carefully. Therefore, on the one hand, they supported Europe's anti-communism, and on the other hand, they called on China to tolerate communism.</p>
<p>The commentator of the New York Mirror cited Li Hongzhang's and Lobanov's 1898 Sino-Russian Treaty to illustrate the Tsar's ambition to attach importance to the East, and then talked about today's Stalin's approach to the Tsar's practice, and even the blindness of the United States' foreign policy towards the Far East in recent years. The Mirror said: "Only such confused diplomats would do this." "They would: when they are happy, they would praise Madame Chiang as a god. When they are not happy, they would run away to the hospital, letting the female leader of our allied countries for many years be treated like a refugee in Washington"!</p>
<p>The brave Madame Chiang, she ran to the hospital to find Marshall and had two long talks. The content has not been released yet. ABC Radio reported that "Madame Chiang visited Marshall in the hospital, and Marshall's attitude was as arrogant as if he were receiving representatives of the German and "this" people."</p>
<p>A radio reporter from WBC humorously reported that "Truman has been busy rearranging the treasures of the United States these days, so that the brave Madame Chiang can't find where the American gold and silver are"?</p>
<p>When will Madame Chiang be able to discover this treasure? When will she be able to win sympathy? That depends on the timing and the use of wisdom. But in any case, Madame Chiang is loved by the American people. The editor of the New York Herald Tribune, Donler (Columbia Professor), wrote: "No matter how good or bad the national policy is, Madame Chiang is always respected and loved by the American people. She is the first foreign woman in American history to be able to win the widespread praise of the American people"!</p>

During the meeting, the presidents of the schools decided to end the current semester early in view of the fact that students in South China have been asking for leave to return to their hometowns, and students in the war zone have had their economic sources cut off. In order to adapt to the situation and take into account the facts, Zhijiang decided to start the final examination on the 16th, Datong started the final examination on the 20th, Guanghua started the final examination on the 23rd, Aurora and Daxia started the final examination on the 24th, China Business College started the final examination on the 26th, and most other schools also scheduled to finish the examination and start the holiday before the end of the year to end the academic program for this semester. The starting date for the next semester should be February 22 according to the regulations of the Ministry of Education, and classes should start on the 29th or March 1. Now the presidents of the schools have decided to start school one week earlier on February 14, and classes will start on the 21st. The courses that are missing due to the early end of this semester will be made up in the next semester. However, there are also special cases, such as St. John's, which has decided to end this semester at the end of the month and start the academic program for the next semester one week after the holiday. Registration will be on January 6 and 7, and classes will start on the 10th. The tuition fee for the next semester will be calculated by multiplying 32 yuan by the cost of living index at the end of December this year, with 96 yuan for this semester as the base number, and will be paid in three installments. The tuition fees for the second and third installments will be calculated according to the cost of living index at the time of payment. Shanghai University will also decide based on St. John's affordability.</p>
<p>Schools Urge Allocation of Rice</p>
<p>The allocation of rice for each school in December has not been allocated yet, and students' meals are in a panic. It was decided at the meeting yesterday to send three presidents, Ou Yuanhuai, Wang Zhizhuo, and Pan Xulun, to negotiate with the Civil Affairs Committee to urge the allocation immediately. In addition, Paul Fu, the head of the Shanghai office of the US Information Service, recently resigned and returned to the United States. The presidents of the schools had many interactions with Chuan on weekdays. In order to express their reluctance to part with him, Liu Haisu, the president of the US Academy of Fine Arts, painted a fan and had it signed by the presidents of various private universities and colleges and presented it to Fu as a souvenir.</p>

<h3 id="e102">A Word to Those Coming to Guangzhou from Other Provinces: Think Thrice Before Acting <a href="#e102" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c102" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">102</a></h3>
<p>— By Our Reporter Liang Xiaozhong</p>
<p>[Guangzhou, 12th Dispatch from Our Newspaper] The war along the Yangtze and Huai Rivers has brought Guangzhou into an even greater state of prosperity.</p>
<p>For the past month, a tide of people has been pouring into this important southern city from North and Central China, filling every available dwelling. From "necessary preparations" to "outsiders" wandering the streets, everything has become the most stimulating topic of conversation.</p>
<p>Guangzhou's urban area has approximately 180,000 houses, which were originally already perceived as extremely valuable, given the population of over 600,000. With the wave of evacuation, Cantonese people from East China are returning south, and "outsiders" from Jiangsu and Zhejiang are pouring in. With the difficulty of living in Hong Kong, Guangzhou naturally seems the most ideal. As a result, everyone is scrambling and competing, leading to high prices in bidding. Guangzhou landlords have also learned the benefits of "extra fees." A small Western-style house can command exorbitant sums, with three, five, or seven "extra fees" without worrying about anyone being unwilling to pay. Land prices have soared to unprecedented levels, with demands often made in Hong Kong dollars or gold. Consequently, many of those evacuating from other places and seeking a place to settle have returned in disappointment, unable to find even a foothold.</p>
<p>The difficulties in finding housing for newcomers caused by the evacuation wave, along with the alarming price levels akin to those in Beijing and Shanghai, have also followed the influx southward, posing a threat to residents' livelihoods. According to statistics from relevant departments, Guangzhou's current prices have risen by an average of over threefold in the past month, more than double those of Beijing and Shanghai. (The cost of public utilities is five times that of Shanghai). To accurately report the latest prices, one must write them down only at the post office counter. Therefore, those busy "fleeing the disaster" and coming south should think thrice before acting.</p>
<p>Due to the changing situation, Guangzhou's importance has undeniably been increasing. Chairman Song Ziwen's presence in the southern frontier and his recent hard work and busyness are beyond what outsiders can imagine. Even the appointment of a minor police chief is done personally, naturally to strengthen the overall security of South China. According to a recent announcement by the Guangzhou Pacification Headquarters, "Security in various parts of South China, after careful deployment, is now sufficient to deal with any sudden event." At the same time, dispatches were sent to all suppression zones to intensify the campaign to eliminate bandits in their respective jurisdictions, to ensure complete safety, and plans were made to recruit 200,000 soldiers next year to consolidate the region. A series of measures will solidify South China.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the development of resources is progressing alongside military affairs. With the official opening of Huangpu Port, the smooth flow of materials is gradually approaching the ideal. To enhance transportation efficiency, Chairman Song Ziwen recently allocated substantial funds, ordering the accelerated completion of the Huangpu branch line of the Yuehan Railway. When American aid arrives, it will be unloaded at Huangpu and transported to the war zones along the Yuehan Railway. The importance of its position is self-evident. At the same time, due to the southward relocation of factories and some institutions under the National Resources Commission, the center of import and export has shifted from Shanghai to the south, further promoting Guangzhou's industrial prosperity. Everything is progressing rapidly. With 40 million people diligently working together, Guangdong will undoubtedly be able to rekindle the revolutionary spirit and strength of the Northern Expedition era under the leadership of Chairman Song Ziwen!</p>
<h3 id="e103">Sichuan Intensifies the Organization and Training of the Populace <a href="#e103" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c103" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">103</a></h3>
<p>[Chengdu, 10th Dispatch from Our Newspaper] After the establishment of the Sichuan Self-Defense Committee, it was decided to convene a provincial conference of the populace to safeguard Sichuan, resist bandits, and save the country. The provincial council was tasked with drafting a plan to pacify Sichuan and defend against bandits. The entire population of Sichuan has begun mobilization and is implementing emergency measures step by step. Militarily, self-defense organization and training are being carried out, refining a militia of 2 million. A request has been made to the central government to allocate 100,000 self-defense rifles, and civilian firearms will be borrowed to expand the security forces by 16 regiments. In addition, five divisions of the Sichuan Army will be expanded, including two divisions of Sun Zhen, and one division each of Luo Guangwen, Yang Gancai, and Xiang Minzhi. There are also plans for another mobile self-defense corps of the populace. Politically, free expression will be encouraged, uniting the government and the public, thoroughly eradicating corruption, clarifying official governance, and mobilizing the populace. The government and the people will jointly form a new organization to suppress and defend Sichuan. Economically, a special self-defense levy will be collected, forcing those with money to contribute, and prices and materials will be comprehensively managed and controlled.</p>
<p>Self-defense organization and training are currently being carried out in various counties. According to the "Sichuan Province Populace Self-Defense Organization and Training Plan" drafted by the provincial government: (1) Each county and city will establish a populace self-defense organization and training headquarters, with the county magistrate concurrently serving as the commander, and a specially appointed deputy commander responsible for actual operations. A self-defense brigade will be established in each township, and a self-defense squad in each bao, with a three-tiered system of responsibility, all under the overall command of the provincial security headquarters. (2) The self-defense team will be based on the bao squad, with each bao drawing one to three able-bodied men from each jia to rotate training. (3) The principle of the self-defense team is to not be separated from production. Able-bodied men aged 18 to 45 will be organized. (4) The principle of "man not separated from gun, gun not separated from village" will be followed, with basic-level cadres selected by the squad themselves. It is expected that this organizational training work will be completed by next spring.</p>
<h3 id="e104">Henan Students Wander Along the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Line <a href="#e104" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c104" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">104</a></h3>
<p>— By Our Reporter Jiang Feng</p>
<p>[Jinhua, 12th Dispatch from Our Newspaper] Thousands upon thousands of students have fled in a state of chaos from various cities in the Central Plains. They probably left in too much of a hurry, and other than what they could carry on their shoulders – a bedding roll and some scattered clothing – they left everything behind, heading southeast on their way. These refugee youths, with weary feet, are drifting along the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Line via the Beijing-Shanghai-Hangzhou Line.</p>
<p>On the special trains carrying refugee students westward along the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway, hundreds of students are packed into dilapidated carriages, often accompanied by the mournful tunes of Henan ballads.</p>
<p>The recently repaired Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway is extremely poorly equipped, and the sudden burden of transporting refugee students is proving to be somewhat overwhelming. Therefore, except for the one or two express trains that manage to operate as usual, the bottoms of all other passenger and freight trains (numbers 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 41, and 42) have been entirely converted for the evacuation of refugee students since the ninth of last month. In just the short half-month from the tenth to the twenty-fifth of last month, a total of over 20,000 refugee students from a dozen or so schools, including Henan Yuzhang, Zhengzhong, Zheng Gong, Kaizhong, Kaishi, Jizhong, Yanzhong, Shangzhong, Xuzhong, and Zhongzheng, have been evacuated.</p>
<p>The reporter recently visited the Xuchang Normal School, Yuhua United Middle School, and Heyue United Middle School in Lanxi, Jinhua, and Quzhou, respectively. The students' miserable situation and the schools' difficult circumstances are the same in all three schools. Except for Heyue United Middle School, where Director Tang Enbo of the Quzhou Pacification Headquarters helped to build thatched huts, most are cramped in ancestral halls and temples, sleeping on the ground. During the day, they take out the only one or two books they have and stand in the wilderness to read. At night, two or three people share a thin blanket, huddled together on the dirt floor. Now, as it is early winter, many students are so poor that they don't even have cotton-padded clothes, and they resist the cold wind with their bodies. They are all enduring the refugee life with great patience and hardship.</p>

<p>The Guild Will Convene a Meeting Today to Discuss Countermeasures</p>
<p>[Suzhou, 14th Dispatch from Our Newspaper] Some members of the Theater Industry Guild advocate a complete shutdown of business as a protest against the destruction of the Meiqi Theater last night due to a conflict with students from Soochow University. However, the guild, for the sake of prudence, has decided to convene a meeting on the 15th to discuss the matter further.</p>
<h3 id="e106">Guizhou Plans to Increase Production and Develop Weining Caohai <a href="#e106" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c106" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">106</a></h3>
<p>— By Our Reporter Liu Mengchi</p>
<p>[Guiyang, 11th Dispatch from Our Newspaper] Guizhou is located on the Yunnan-Guizhou Plateau, with many mountains and little water. Although rivers such as the Wujiang and Nanpanjiang flow through the province, they are impeded by towering mountains and steep cliffs, lacking both convenient navigation and irrigation. Moreover, floods often occur in summer and autumn, causing disasters and hardship for the residents along the rivers. In recent years, those who study hydraulic engineering have been searching for the secrets of the mountains and rivers to develop hidden resources, either by utilizing the water level difference to build power generation projects, or by draining accumulated water from deep pools to develop farmland irrigation, rectifying deviations and saving the drought-stricken, which greatly benefits the prosperity of the rural economy. Since assuming office this summer, Guizhou Provincial Chairman Gu Zhenglun has made "developing ground resources" the main theme of construction, and has been making unremitting efforts to build farmland water conservancy and increase food production. Recently, the provincial government standing committee approved the development of over 60,000 mu of land in the Weining Caohai area in the northwest of the province, a water conservancy project covering a total drainage area of 380 square kilometers. It advanced the full cost of the surveying team from October to December of this year, which is a good policy for striving to build the rear and supporting the front's pacification efforts. Therefore, I will report on the various aspects of the Caohai development in summary to benefit readers who are concerned about rear area construction.</p>
<p>The Flooding of Caohai</p>
<p>Caohai is located west of Weining County in the northwest of Guizhou Province. According to the county chronicles, the area was originally a vast plain, with three rivers formed by the convergence of water from the four mountains, flowing through it and dividing into the deep water pool that eliminates water in front of the Dragon King Temple near Jiangjiawan across from Yangguan Mountain, and into dozens of dry caves in the Ao River. In the twenty-seventh year of the Daoguang Emperor of the Qing Dynasty, continuous rain and mountain floods broke out, with surging waves carrying sand and rocks, destroying and blocking all the holes that eliminated water, causing the drainage to be ineffective, the plain to be submerged, and the land to sink. The water flowed and swirled, gradually forming a "sea," with an area of approximately 45 square kilometers, equivalent to more than 67,500 mu. The loss of good farmland was once submerged by water, and the loss was terrible.</p>
<p>Early Surveying</p>
<p>In the eighteenth year of the Guangxu Emperor, General Su Yuanrui once dug a drainage ditch to lead the accumulated water into the Black Rock Cave, but the work was suspended due to Su's departure. Although the effect was not significant, the water level was slightly lowered. In June of the 30th year of the Republic of China, the county magistrate of the county, Zhou Fushi, requested the provincial government to send a team to survey the area. The former Guizhou Provincial Farmland Water Conservancy Loan Committee organized the "Caohai Survey Team" in October of that year, sending personnel to lead the team to conduct a preliminary survey. However, its purpose was to focus on understanding whether the drainage design was possible, so it only surveyed the terrain in the area from the bridge to the Black Rock Cave, without covering the entire Caohai area. It took two months to get a rough idea.</p>
<p>Interruption of the Project</p>
<p>According to the drainage plan formulated by the Farmland Loan Committee survey team based on the preliminary survey results at that time, the area of Caohai was 45 square kilometers, the drainage area of Caohai was 180 square kilometers, in addition, another river flowed into Caohai, and the drainage area of the river was 200 square kilometers, so the total drainage area of Caohai was actually 380 square kilometers, its water level was 98.14 meters (assuming the height of the benchmark was 100 meters, set on the foundation of the Li family house on the west side of the bridge), the deepest height of the seabed was 94.34 meters (the height of the ordinary seabed was mostly 96 meters), assuming that it could be drained in five days, the drainage volume was 250 cubic meters per second, which was the number required at the beginning of the drainage period. Once the drainage canal was completed, the water level would drop, and the subsequent drainage volume could be reduced to one-fifth of the above number, which was 50 cubic meters per second, which was the drainage volume estimated based on the existing volume of Caohai. Based on this estimate, the team designed the Caohai drainage project, which was divided into two parts: the first part was to drain the accumulated water, and the second part was to build canals to irrigate farmland. In addition, it may be possible to use a tunnel to drain water and generate 600 kilowatts of electricity to promote the rural industry in the vicinity. According to the budget prepared in August of the 32nd year of the Republic of China according to this project plan, approximately 70,654,000 yuan in legal tender was required for the project cost. Later, because the Agricultural Bank of China did not approve the loan, and because Guizhou was invaded by the enemy in the south, the overall situation was greatly affected, and this project was suspended again.</p>
<p>Suspension Again</p>
<p>Later, the Weining County government felt that the project was of great importance to local interests, so in May of the 33rd year, it convened a meeting of local gentry to decide to plan and implement it by itself, to be completed in five years. The part of the project was decided to be built by collecting labor, and the stone work part was to be funded by raising funds, but because the local revenue was insufficient and the financial resources were limited, it still insisted on requesting the Agricultural Bank of China to loan 10 million yuan in legal tender each year as a subsidy, but it was not recognized by the Agricultural Bank of China, and the project was suspended again, causing this vast plain of 45 square kilometers to be abandoned, which was a pity.</p>
<p>Revitalizing Water Conservancy</p>
<p>Chairman Gu Zhenglun patrolled the counties in the northwest of the province last month. After passing through Weining and returning to the province, he witnessed the hardship of the counties in the northwest of the province, where agricultural production was not abundant and it was difficult to be self-sufficient. He felt very regretful, believing that the only way to relieve the local rural areas was to reclaim wasteland, build water conservancy, and increase food production. He ordered the Guizhou Provincial Water Conservancy Bureau to plan and implement the Weining Caohai drainage project to restore the past farmland and increase food production, and to facilitate the development of the area after the Xukun Railway and Xiangqian Railway are connected in the county in the future. The maps, reports, and various records obtained by the Farmland Loan Committee survey team that day were either simple due to the loss of focus, or were lost due to years of disrepair. At present, if we want to talk about development, we must ask the central government for money. To ask for money, we need budgets, plans, survey maps, and other things that are indispensable. The Water Conservancy Bureau had no choice but to go back and repeat the survey again.</p>
<p>Survey Report</p>
<p>Recently, according to the preliminary report from the head of the second section of the bureau and the head of the survey team, Jiang Yunxin, and the survey team of eight people who arrived at Caohai and surveyed for more than half a month, the water level of Caohai has undergone major changes in recent years, with the deepest point being no more than six or seven meters, and the shallowest point being only about one meter. It is the shallowest "sea" seen in the interior of our country. In the shallow and clear part, the old paths can still be clearly seen. Once the water flow is discharged, there is no doubt that cultivation can be restored. The surveying work is still actively progressing in the cold weather, and it will be fully completed by the end of February next year. According to Water Conservancy Bureau Director Zhang Hongchang, once the surveying work is completed and the maps and records are compiled, a detailed project plan will be prepared and sent to the central government for inclusion in the budget, and it is hoped that it can be allocated as soon as possible, hoping that construction can be prepared in the spring of next year, so that the food problem in the northwest of Guizhou next year can be largely resolved, and the song of "Farmer's Joy" can then be broadcast with a smile from the mouths of the frowning and worried poor farmers.</p>

<h3 id="e109">Hong Kong Military and Police Grand Exercise Ends; Grantham Sternly Warns the Communists <a href="#e109" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c109" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">109</a></h3>
<p>— By Our Special Correspondent Zijian</p>
<p>[Hong Kong, 12th Dispatch from Our Newspaper] "We cannot compromise with communism. One cannot compromise with the devil… They interfere with our way of life, therefore we must firmly resist. Since the Fascist Devil was destroyed, we are now facing another demon, namely Communism. In its total disregard for the human soul, it is as bad as Fascist tyranny…"</p>
<p>This was a speech given by Hong Kong Governor Grantham on the evening of the 9th at Morrison Hall of the University of Hong Kong after Hong Kong's first major post-war military and police exercise (see the 10th Industrial and Commercial Evening News). The Governor's statement at this time that "Do not compromise with the Communists" has attracted considerable attention here. As far as we remember, the Governor visited General MacArthur last month, and then went south to Singapore to hold a conference of British territories in Southeast Asia. The Governor, who usually lives quietly next to a park in Hong Kong, now seems to be busy. In this speech, in addition to condemning the wrongdoings of communism, the Governor also issued a stern warning to the rampant Communists. He said: "Communists must understand that if we peace-loving people are attacked, we will resist, and at the same time we must not deceive ourselves, nor can we be deceived by others."</p>
<p>Is this speech by the Governor aimed at the Communists in Hong Kong?</p>
<p>Another Exercise</p>
<p>The Hong Kong military and police grand exercise, which lasted for four days, was officially announced to be over at 9:00 am on the 9th. British Army Chief of Staff Lieutenant Colonel Alexander said that the results of the exercise were "fairly satisfactory." Alexander revealed that the British Army authorities are preparing to hold another exercise of the same nature in February next year.</p>
<p>Reuters reported from London on the 8th that British Defense Minister Alexander said in the Lower House on the 8th that in view of the advance of the Communists, attention has been continuously paid to security measures in Hong Kong. British Colonial Undersecretary Winnis also said that the government has taken all possible steps to prevent Hong Kong's population from being overly crowded and chaotic. It seems that the situation in Hong Kong has now been noticed by the gentlemen in London.</p>
<p>After this telegram was sent out, the English-language South China Morning Post on the 10th reported on the security of Hong Kong under the headline, reporting that the Gurkha Rifles, which are now protecting rubber plantations and tin mines in Singapore against the Malayan Communist guerrillas, will be transferred to Hong Kong by the end of this year to increase defense. The Gurkha Rifles are a type of Indian soldier, tall and strong, known for their bravery and skill in battle. Most of the Gurkha people live near Nepal on the Sino-Indian border. They have long been recruited by the British to be the main force protecting British interests, and they have done a lot for Britain in both World Wars. Now they are coming to Hong Kong again, regardless of the long distance.</p>
<p>A cartoon recently published in a local newspaper depicts a wealthy man who has just arrived from Shanghai, who is taken aback when he sees the British army exercise. If this wealthy man had read this reporter's report, he might have simply wanted to turn back from Hong Kong.</p>

<h3 id="e112">Local Raw Cotton Has Entered the Market in Large Quantities; The Joint Purchasing Association Strengthens Collection and Storage; The Routine Meeting Yesterday Decided to Increase Funds by 200 Million Yuan Again <a href="#e112" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c112" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">112</a></h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] The National Cotton Joint Purchasing Committee held a routine meeting yesterday. After discussion, it was decided that local raw cotton has entered the market in large quantities to enrich the raw cotton inventory and adjust rural finance. It was decided to increase financial assistance again and launch a comprehensive purchasing operation. As a result, it was decided to increase cotton purchase funds by 200 million yuan again, to be borne equally by the Central Bank and the China Textile Construction Corporation. According to the original amount of cotton purchase funds of about 200 million yuan, 200 million yuan was increased at the routine meeting last week. Including the funds increased this week, the total amount of cotton purchase funds has reached 600 million yuan. All funds will be allocated this month.</p>
<p>Since the association launched the cotton collection, it has now collected 220,000 dan, and there should be no problem in collecting 500,000 dan by the end of this month. According to the current situation, just in Hankou, as long as there are sufficient funds, there is no problem in collecting 10,000 dan per day.</p>
<p>In addition, 12,000 pieces of yarn previously paid by private factories are priced at 789 yuan per piece according to the limited price. Now the Central Bank is purchasing it and giving a subsidy of 6,500 yuan per piece, for a total price of more than 50 million yuan.</p>
<p>[Another Dispatch] As of now, the National Cotton Joint Purchasing Committee has collected more than 200,000 dan of cotton. Most of the above cotton is allocated to the National Bank and the Textile Construction Corporation, and a small amount is allocated to private yarn factories. The reason is that very few private factories participate in the joint purchasing business. Although there are one or two, they have not paid the second batch of working capital, so they did not go to pick up the quota they received. It is also learned that recently, the cotton collection agencies in various places of the Joint Purchasing Association have been very prosperous. Farmers in the Shanghai and Hankou districts have been very enthusiastic about selling their cotton. Since the war situation has been tense, most private factories have not launched cotton collection work, and even their business policies are mostly uncertain. Furthermore, many of the important responsible persons of the factories have left Shanghai, so the cotton collection work has turned cold. This situation may affect the supply of raw materials for the cotton spinning industry next year, so the Joint Purchasing Association intends to seize the time to increase the storage of local cotton, and will discuss with the National Bank and the Textile Construction Corporation to allocate more funds so that it can be purchased as much as possible during the peak season.</p>
<h3 id="e113">Exchange of Gold Principles Remain Unchanged; Technical Improvements Await the Announcement of New Measures by the Central Bank; Authorities Deny Reduction of Exchange Quota <a href="#e113" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c113" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">113</a></h3>
<p>According to Mr. Li Xiaozhuang, Deputy Director of the Business Bureau of the Central Bank, in an interview with a reporter, recent rumors that restrictions would soon be placed on the exchange of gold and silver for deposits, limiting each person to two taels of gold and twenty yuan of silver, are completely untrue. Yesterday (the 14th), the exchange limit for gold was still ten taels, and for silver dollars, it remained at the previous amount of forty-nine yuan. As for whether the number of application forms issued daily would be increased to encourage the recall of currency, the Central Bank has not made any decision. The bank is currently awaiting the announcement of the new measures for the exchange of gold and silver by the Ministry of Finance.</p>
<p>New Measures for Gold Exchange Include Three Principles</p>
<p>According to sources within the new financial management authorities, the new law regarding the exchange of gold and silver for deposits contains three principles:</p>
<p>(1) Preventing "scalpers" and "powerful individuals" from monopolizing the exchange. (2) Ensuring that all people have the opportunity to exchange. (3) Limiting the amount of exchange to avoid large-scale arbitrage by a small number of wealthy individuals and to prevent a repeat of the past policy of selling gold.</p>
<p>The source also stated that the Ministry of Finance has already formulated detailed measures based on these principles, which will be formally announced in the coming days. As for rumors that the government's gold reserves are depleted due to the recent rush to exchange gold, this is absolutely inaccurate. Although the number of people exchanging gold and silver in various places has increased in recent days, the amount exchanged is not large. Therefore, the government will definitely continue to manage the exchange of gold and silver in accordance with its established policy.</p>

<h3 id="e117">Planned Capital Increase of Banks and Financial Institutions to be Deposited; Amount Estimated at Approximately 60 Million Yuan <a href="#e117" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c117" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">117</a></h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] The Ministry of Finance previously decided to extend the deadline for commercial banks and financial institutions to deposit their increased capital at the Central Bank to the end of this month. However, to date, none of the banks and financial institutions have applied to the Central Bank. According to the Central Bank, banks and financial institutions in other cities have generally completed the process. Although banks and financial institutions in this city have not applied to the Central Bank for deposit, most of the capital increase work has been completed. It is expected that the entire process will be completed within the next half month. It is estimated that the amount of increased capital to be deposited is approximately 60 million gold yuan. Although the money supply in this city has recently become loose, the market situation is expected to return to normal once the banks and financial institutions complete the deposit process.</p>
<h3 id="e118">Canned Food Industry; Sales Decreasing Daily <a href="#e118" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c118" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">118</a></h3>
<p>According to the Industrial Association, the situation of the canned food industry is as follows: In 1914, only Taikang Company had a factory producing bread, biscuits, and canned food. In 1918, Guanshengyuan Factory was established, manufacturing various pastries and canned foods, and together with Taikang Company, they were known as the two giants of the food industry. In 1933, the Merlin Canning Factory was established, mainly producing canned goods. Later, factories such as Weida, Jimei, Rusheng, and Kailin were established one after another. There are a total of 16 factories of various sizes in this city, with 1,074 workers. The equipment includes 112 can-making machines, 12 punch presses, 374 foot-operated punch presses, 7 shear cars, 26 steaming tanks, 15 cooking pots, 9 vacuum pumps, 2 egg beaters, 1 orange peel car, 20 lid-making machines, 4 green bean shelling machines, 3 bean sorting machines, 8 tomato machines, 9 crushing and grinding machines, 21 candy machines, 2 sets of soda equipment, and 2 sets of automatic biscuit-making machines. The annual output of products includes 310,000 boxes of various canned foods, 25,000 boxes of various bottled condiments, 130,000 tins of biscuits, 360,000 jin of bulk biscuits, 3,600 boxes of Huadiao wine, 5.5 million pieces of bread and pastries, and 200,000 dozen of soda, fresh orange juice, and fruit syrup. Most of the raw materials used are domestic products. Only 40,000 boxes of tinplate, 8,000 reams of copperplate paper and cellophane, 120 tons of fuel oil, and a portion of chemical raw materials are imported from abroad. However, recently, domestic wages and prices have risen sharply, making it difficult to export products. Exports are only half of what they used to be. Due to inconvenient transportation, sales in northern and inland China have decreased significantly. In this city, due to the weak purchasing power of the people, there is an oversupply in the market. The daily expenses of factories have increased dramatically, so many are reducing their workforce.</p>
<h3 id="e119">Yarn Prices Continue to Rise; Cotton Cloth Prices Fluctuate Slightly Higher <a href="#e119" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c119" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">119</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, cotton yarn prices started flat and ended strong. The money supply remained loose, and there were still many buyers in the market. However, those holding goods, believing that prices had reached their peak, were considering selling, so supply and demand were still balanced. As a result, the prices of all yarns were still slightly higher than the previous day.</p>
<p>42-count Blue Phoenix opened at 16,500 yuan and closed at 17,500 yuan, an increase of 1,700 yuan. Other yarns, such as Baoguang and Jincheng, also rose by about 1,500 yuan.</p>
<p>32-count Silver Moon rose by 400 yuan and closed at 15,200 yuan. 21-count Double Horse spot goods initially opened at 14,000 yuan, then fell to 13,800 yuan, but finally rebounded to 14,600 yuan, an increase of 400 yuan.</p>
<p>20-count Double Horse rose from 12,000 yuan to 12,300 yuan, an increase of 600 yuan. 16-count Guangming and 10-count Boy Scout yarns were both close to the 10,000 yuan mark, at 9,500 yuan. Other yarns also ended firmly.</p>
<p>Cotton cloth trading was sparse. Buyers, anticipating further price increases, mostly remained on the sidelines. Northern merchants continued to sell at high prices. The market opened firm in the morning, but prices fell before rebounding, and finally saw slight progress.</p>
<p>Longtou fine cloth opened at 535 yuan, then fell to 515 yuan. At one point, due to support from the floor traders, it rose to the highest price of 555 yuan from the previous day. The noon close was 540 yuan, an increase of 15 yuan. Laba Tong fine cloth alone fell by 15 yuan. Junzi Yuan drill opened at 530 yuan, reached a high of 555 yuan, and closed at 545 yuan, an increase of 10 yuan. Jinlian Miaowu Yuan drill also rose by about 10 yuan. Sijunzi Yuan Zhigong rose by 15 yuan and closed at 565 yuan. Tiao Li Yuan Guang oblique remained unchanged at 320 yuan. Other colored cloths and printed cloths also showed improvement.</p>
<p>China Textile Distribution</p>
<p>Due to price fluctuations, the market was quite receptive. China Textile's distribution yesterday was also very strong. A total of 14,320 bolts of various colored cloths, 880 yuan of bedsheets, and 12,000 pounds of remnants were sold, bringing in a total of 7,663,400 yuan in gold yuan. The prices were: Sijunzi Yuan Zhigong Ne 555 yuan, Sijunzi Biji 535 yuan, Tiao Li Changqing Biji 500 yuan, Tiao   Hui Guang Xie 290 yuan, Tiao   Handkerchief Cloth 480 yuan, Sijunzi Hua Biji 490 yuan, Second-Grade Hua Gong Ne 440 yuan, Second-Grade Hua Biji 440 yuan, Lion Furnace Sailcloth 660 yuan, Da Ling Extra Fine Cloth 360 yuan, Da Ling Extra Fine Oblique 360 yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e120">Tea Market Trend is Strong <a href="#e120" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c120" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">120</a></h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] According to tea industry authorities, export tea merchants, seeing that costs have increased sharply and that foreign exchange transfer certificates are conducive to exports, and also because of the recent loose money supply and low market interest rates (only 14-15 yuan per thousand yuan for daily discounts), may be inclined to hold on to their goods and are unwilling to sell them at a loss. Therefore, although export purchases by Xiehe and Yihua are strong, it is difficult to achieve their desired results, and transactions remain sluggish, but the underlying trend is exceptionally strong.</p>
<p>Domestic sales of tea in areas such as Benjie are in high demand, but the prices of goods also change rapidly, so the trend remains active and colorful.</p>
<h3 id="e121">Tung Oil Base Firm <a href="#e121" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c121" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">121</a></h3>
<p>Since the sharp increase the day before yesterday, the tung oil trend remained strong yesterday. This is mainly because of the recent influx of capital from North China, which has loosened the money supply in the market, and daily discount interest rates have fallen. Therefore, holders of goods, seeing that borrowing is easy, are trying to hold on to their goods, so the situation is stable and the base is firm.</p>
<h3 id="e122">Prices at Production Areas Fall; Rice Market Slightly Weak; Flour and Coarse Grains Turn Downward; Edible Oil Hovers <a href="#e122" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c122" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">122</a></h3>
<p>The rice market saw a slight decline because prices in Wuxi fell the previous day, so sentiment was very weak. In addition, there was a large arrival of goods, and with owners eagerly seeking to sell, prices finally declined by 10 yuan. In the South Market, white japonica rice and thin rice were both priced at 365 yuan, each 10 yuan lower than the previous day. Early rice fell by 15 yuan. Zhangyan early rice opened at 350 yuan, and indica rice fell by 5 yuan. Prices in the North Market remained firm.

Yesterday's arrivals were 4,502 shi in the South Market and 7,814 shi in the North Market.</p>
<p>Flour</p>
<p>Stopped rising and turned downward because the increase the previous day was too large, and actual sales were slow. In addition, those intending to trade took the opportunity to sell. Tianjin merchants sold a lot of Lao Che flour, opening at 160 yuan, then falling to 153 yuan, a decrease of 9 yuan from the previous day. Bingchuan flour closed at 150 yuan, a decrease of 4 yuan. Hongfeng and Jiancheng were priced at 138-139 yuan. Miscellaneous brands of flour also fell by 5-6 yuan. Bran also declined, with large bags falling by 5 yuan.</p>
<p>Coarse Grains</p>
<p>Mostly weakened, but soybeans rose because Shantou merchants bought them. Zhadou closed at 190 yuan, an increase of 15 yuan. Corn purchases by merchant groups decreased, falling by 10-15 yuan. Red sorghum from inland areas became slow to move, falling by 5-10 yuan. Mung beans were actively sold by vermicelli factories, rising by 10-20 yuan. Jianqing sales were sluggish, falling by 10 yuan. Sesame also fell slightly by 20 yuan. Raw peanuts fell slightly by 10 yuan.</p>
<p>Edible Oil</p>
<p>Prices hovered at a high point. The initial market showed signs of weakness, but later became firm because oil factories did not open. Soybean oil's highest price was 1,070 yuan, closing at 1,050 yuan, a slight increase of 10 yuan. Rapeseed oil closed at 950 yuan, up 20 yuan. Raw oil did not rise enough the previous day, so yesterday Jitong raw oil rose by 100 yuan, to 1,150 yuan. Small cart sesame oil rose by 90 yuan. Soybean cake rose by 3-4 yuan.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the silk market went high then fluctuated, with a stable trend. After the opening of various stalls, there was active trading in the market, and sentiment was calm. The close was slightly higher by 200-300 yuan.</p>
<p>120-count Tianqiao initially opened at 15,400 yuan, and Dongyang at 15,600 yuan. After the opening, it was heard that the trends of various external goods were flat. The floor traders did not intend to raise prices. The holders also took the opportunity to settle. The silk weaving industry still had strong demand, so the market saw little fluctuation. It was slightly better by 200 yuan near the close.</p>
<p>The raw silk market also had a flat trend yesterday. There was a loose money supply in the industry. Various external goods did not fluctuate. Foreign firms' purchases were sluggish. The silk weaving industry's interest was weak. Holders also had ample funds and were reluctant to sell. Sentiment was mostly wait-and-see. There were few transactions at various grades.</p>
<p>The silk satin market first rose and then softened yesterday. Sentiment was quite firm at the initial opening, and prices rose straight up. In the middle, retail sellers kept selling, and sales to customers were not smooth, so prices went down again. Huaqiang bedspreads and Meiya bedspreads opened at 10,800 yuan and 11,000 yuan, respectively. After the opening, there were long calls for bids, but no transactions were heard, and sentiment suddenly softened. Floating sellers took the opportunity to settle, and prices fell back by 500 yuan. Finally, the market entered a stalemate. Near the close, Meiya settled at 10,600 yuan, and Huaqiang at 10,400 yuan.</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] It is understood that since the authorities adopted the new method of releasing the exchange rate daily, our country's remittance income has improved compared to the past. However, due to the turbulent situation and the lack of security for domestic investment, the income is still not as large as expected. September saw the best remittance income situation after the currency reform, with stable prices. Since October, the handling banks have been submitting monthly remittance figures to the Ministry of Finance, and no longer making them public. Recently, due to the unrest situation, the flow of domestic capital to the Philippines has had a considerable impact on our country's remittance income, because at one point after the currency reform, remittances from the Philippines ranked first in our country's overall remittances. In the current situation, remittances from the Philippines are bound to have a significant reduction.</p>
<p>[Another Report] According to the person in charge of the Currency Department of the Ministry of Finance: Regarding the government's absorption of remittances, the situation has improved in recent months since the revision of the methods. As for how to guide overseas Chinese capital to import equipment and materials, in addition to striving to simplify procedures and relax restrictions, the government has also formulated other incentive measures for overseas Chinese investment in the country to encourage them. If overseas Chinese are not familiar with the procedures for importing, they can also entrust the Central Trust Bureau to handle import matters on their behalf. Detailed methods are being studied and drafted by the Export-Import Management Committee.</p>
