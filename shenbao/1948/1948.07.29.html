<h3>翁院長昭告全國國民　明辦是非共赴國難　中共確受共產國際統轄</h3>
<p>〔中央社南京廿八日電〕翁院長文灝，頃發表告全国國民書，題爲「明辦是非共赴國難」，其全文如次：</p>
<p>吾國痛受中共的破壞與擾亂，中央政府原望誠意協商，苦心妥洽，以期避免武力的使用，不幸中共方面固執成見，不願共上憲政的途徑，決計擴充部隊，組據地方，破壞社會秩序，摧殘人民生命財產，以致釀成動搖國脈的險象，政府爲鞏固國本及保護人民計，迫不得已，決定實行戡亂，以期剿平叛國的匪徒。</p>
<p>附從共黨者，原爲中國人民，其愛護國家與其以良民用心應無二致，所苦者此等人民爲中共匪黨的威力所脅迫，被逼走入歧途，共同從事於危國害民的工作，所以一切作爲實應由中共匪黨負其責任。中共爲什麼要危國害民堅持不怠呢，實因中共爲世界共黨活動的部份，中共的每一行動，每一宣傳，無不以共黨國際的意見爲依歸，始終一致，沒有絲毫的歧異，由本月十日中共所發表的接受共產國際情報局處分南斯拉夫共產黨的決議，更可充份證明。</p>
<p>所謂共產國際情報局，係由歐洲九個國家的共黨代表於去年九月下旬在波藺華沙開會所決定設立，原定局址在南斯拉夫的首都貝爾格勒，復於十月五日共同發表宣言，指美·英·法等國爲侵略國，要求共產主義的國家負責保護其他國家之領土及主權，並認美國援助西歐·南美及中國即爲侵略他國的實證，共產主義國家，必須將此類工作澈底打破。到了本年夏間，美國國會議決各項援外辦法，歐洲八個國家的共產代表，復在華沙開會，商議打擊與破壞美援的方法，同時，譏決幷宣布南斯拉夫共產的罪狀，且正式革除了南國共黨的黨籍，此種歐洲共產國際的行爲，原專爲歐洲而發，並未提及中國在內，乃中國的共黨同聲相應，於七月十日發表聲明，對南國共黨備加指責，並命令匪黨幹部「認眞研究共產國際情報局關於南共問題的決議，藉以加强黨內關於階級的，黨的和國際主義的自我批評，精神和紀律性的教育」，這種同聲共應的作爲，正是證明中國共黨確受另一共產國際中心力量的統轄與控制。</p>
<p>我們知道，中共對其黨徒的「教育」和「自我批評」，是用苛刻的檢討與殘暴的淸算做執行的手段，且中共的決議中申明紀律，更可見他們道一次檢討與淸算，必將極盡其苛酷殘忍的能事，以根絕其黨內僅存一綫的民族意識，而不使有絲亳的存留。本來，中國共黨早爲共產國際的支部，他的黨徒，必須向共產國際効忠，執行共產國際的命令，這在他的黨章及黨員共黨誓詞上都原已明白訂定的，所以匪黨這次接受共產國際譴責南共的決議，並藉此機會加深控御黨徒的紀律，原爲意料中事，不足怪的。</p>
<h3>存亡主奴的關頭　無瞻顧徘徊餘地　匪當危國害民已有堅實證明</h3>
<p>共產國際情報局譴責南共指出幾個罪名，更確證共產黨許多口號都是無恥的騙術，南共第一個罪名，是發揚民族主義，中共旣然接受這種決定，便是根本否定了民族主義。南共第二個罪名，是允許小資產階級及農工人等代表全國，以代替共黨的一黨專政，中共旣然接受這種決定，可見他們號召的一「民主聯合政府」，不過是他們的政治陰謀的烟幕。南共第三個罪名，是允許土地私有，人民可以賣買土地，中共旣然接受這種決定，可見他們所宣傳的招撫富農，穩定中農，便只成了空虛的口號，實際上法不可靠。南共第四個罪名，是個人經濟遍及全國，中共旣然接受了這種決定，可見共黨所言保護城市工商業，這是無恥的騙局。由此可見共產國際的實際方針，與中共所用的宣傳口號互相衝突，正是以子之矛，攻子之盾，其虛偽之處，實非常明顯。中共所稱愛國主義與民族陣綫，如果是眞，就決不應接受共產國際的譴責南共，旣然接受了，可見中共所標榜的口號，純是純心欺詐，決不可信的了。</p>
<p>我們藉此機會應該眞確認識中共這種行爲，正是匪黨國際間諜性毫無保留的表現，亦就是匪黨危國害民最堅實的證明，我們對於這種國際武裝第五縱隊的本質與野心，旣然澈底認識，那末努力防議，便是我們最大的職責，決不可輕爲放棄，全國國民到了此種存亡主奴的關頭，決沒有模　兩可，瞻顧徘徊的餘地。</p>
<p>國父說：「民族主義就是國族王義」，又說：「我們鑒於古今氏族生存的道理，要救中中國，想中國民族永遠存在，必要提倡民族主義」，民族是自然力所造成的，人　在人類本性中，有其深厚的根底，我中華民族立國於東亞，已具有久長的歷史及歷史不變的精神，實賴民族大義深入人心，決不是外來暴力與邪說所能動搖，近百年來中國因帝制脣庸，受了不平等條約的束縛。五十年來，更因日本軍閥兵力侵掠，佔領土地，益爲激動了我同胞的民族情感，加强了我同胞的國家意識，發而爲救亡岡存運動，於是國父於全國仁人志士，倡導國民革命爲中國之自由平等而奪鬥，大義所趨，海內外同胞煥然從風，蔣總統秉承國父遺志，率師北伐，統一全國，且堅剛抗戰，恢復五十年來的失土，如取消一百年來的不平等條約，每一步驟，無不以中國之自由平等與統一獨立為目的，事實昭然，當爲全國國民所共知。</p>
<p>對日抗戰勝利結束之後，國民政府毅然決然召開國民大會，制定民主憲法，組設民選政府，努力向民有。民治。民事的目標　步前進，如果沒有共匪的騷擾與戡亂的進行，選舉方法及憲政規模，自必更爲完善。</p>
<p>乃觀共黨方面的歷來行動，向具有自便私圖的目的，彼黨早知我同胞的民族精神爲不可輕侮的力量，不得不假借各種口號，以隱敝其共黨國際支部和第五縱隊的本質，所以他們在我國民革命軍北伐的時期，表面上以打倒帝一國主義相標榜，實際上百計阻撓一北伐，並進而分北國民革命的陣一營。在國民政府成立，全國政權一統一之後，中共更在贛南及陝北一組設獨立政府，割地自雄，在全面抗戰時期，共匪號稱參加抗戰，實際上則藉此擴充武力，準備其反抗政府的計劃。到了抗戰結束，共黨目標首在搶收日軍武器，設立脫離政府的解放區域，一面阻撓國民大會，反對民主憲法，以阻得憲政之進行，可見中共自始創以迄今日，從未放棄其打倒政府分裂國家的野心，其實用方法，向來極權專制與其所倡的新民主主義，　柄矛盾，絕不相符，其所宣傳，更詭詐欺騙，挑撥離間，毫不講信義與眞實，而其所謂自我批評與紀律，更明爲他們壓迫黨徒的工具，所以彼此互相比較，中共的不顧國家，別有企圖，實歷來皆然，昭明若揭。</p>
<h3>政府剿匪戡亂　不是黨爭更不是內戰　脫匪來歸者曲予成全</h3>
<p>因此，我們對於良好國民受中共的甘方所紿，加入彼　，遂嚴受控制，而背棄祖國，實覺深爲可憫。亦因此，我們勸告全國國民，充份明識共黨確是共產國際的附屬組織，確爲危國害民的根源，必須戒愼警慯，切勿爲他們的僞言邪說所誘惑。</p>
<p>當此匪黨國際陰謀充份暴露之時，正是誤入共黨尚具天良的人民急思自拔，翻然來歸之日，凡是不願作奴隸，不肯做漢奸的同胞，都是國家所應愛惜人民所應提携，無論他們過去曾否與國軍作戰，曾否與鄉里爲敵，只要他們脫離匪黨，毅然來歸，政府定必曲予成全，加以保護，在憲法之下，一致爲救國建國而努力。</p>
<p>政府更願對社會上各方人士明白提告，剿匪戡亂，並不是黨爭，更不是內戰，實因中共確是附從共產國際，出賣國家主權，破壞人民權利的危險力量，政府及全國愛國同胞，不能不合力戡平，以期保存國脈。上面所述去年歐洲九國共黨所發宣言，已明言他們的目的，是在打擊美國援助其他国家，使其不能收效。中國共黨，當然亦採取同一方針，因此，正當美國國會議決援華方案，美國援華主管人員將要到華之時，不先不後，中共在各學校鼓動了反美風潮，種稱鼓吹，實則純是共黨的世界方針在我國的表演，決不是我國同胞在這種明證實驗的事實揭示之下，深望全國國民對於是否邪正能够明確辨明，共向救國建國的正確方向一致努力。</p>

<h3>對立院第一會期成就　張肇元發表感想　各委公忠體國實堪欽佩</h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿八日電〕立法院秘書長張肇元氏，頃就其對立法院第一會期之感想發表談話，據稱：「此次行憲首屆立法院第一會期可謂民主政治開始第一章，成就之大，出人意料，余可以事實證之。自五月八日開會，至七月廿四日休會，爲時僅二個月半，已結案共六十一件，其中由政府提出者，計法律案九件，財政案三件，預算案三件，條約案二件，同意案二件，其他二件。由各委員提出者，計有法律案十二件，其他十八件。關於本院本身者十件。此外，在審查中尚未結束案，共九十五件，其中由政府提出者計有法律案卅八件，財政案一件，條約案三件。由各委員提出者計有法律案七件，財政案十四件，其他卅二件，在此短期內，初期因集會伊始，進行較緩，中期效率增高，末期自程序委員會組織後，春進行循軌，不亞於任何先進國家之議院，其間或不無繳繞迴環，空耗光陰之處，然英·美議院之有今日，即數百年痛苦經驗所獲之美果。若以英·美議院之現狀期有我第一會期之立法院未免過著。最堪欽佩者，七百餘立法委員不論如何爭辯，其公忠體國，絕無二致，在表決時，以利害得失爲依據，表示充分理智。至會期內之冒暑　事，漏夜審議預算案及法律案，休會後各種委員會仍由留京各委員與召集人繼續審議院會交付之未了各案，以便於第二次期中及時提付討論，此種請神，尤充分表示各委員　能不負人民之付託。關於事務方面，余於五月十八日就職，政府旣無物質上之準備，余亦不能於奉　前籌備，因之，辦公處所，委員住舍，交通工具以及經費等，均為一時不易解決之問題。秘書處同人不辭勞瘁夜以繼日，其努力排除困難之精神，亦値回燱，而各委員多富有行政經騐，對於事咨上若干未週之因素，均能瞭諒，更使余感奮」。</p>

<h3>慶祝世界運動會揭幕</h3>
<p>正當全世界人類陷於戰亂的恐怖中。第十四屆世界運動大會，今天在倫敦莊嚴地揭幕了。這次奧林匹克天會，在新生的英國京城舉行，規模宏大，參加的國家有六十一單位，各項選手共計六一一八人，任何一種運動大會都不能比得上這次大會的莊嚴偉大。預定今天的開幕程序，先由各國代表團的大行列繞行一週，彼等擎着各該國之旗幟及國名牌盾，受英皇的檢閱。由英皇宣佈奧林匹克大會開始後，即號角齊鳴，禮砲共響，圾後傳　火炬接力之選手，進入帝國運動塲。奧林匹克陞旗禮，在號角中升起了光明的大旗，逾千的銀色信鴿開始飛翔，這是向全世界顯示着奧林匹克大會已經開始。奧林匹克大會是和平·團結·民主·進步的象徽，它帶來的歷史意義，是無限神聖，無限光明，無限偉大。我們歌唱着讚美詩篇，迎接世運會的開幕，並祝頌奧林匹克的祥和空氣，發揮光大。</p>
<p>奧林匹克運動大會，起源於古代希臘，對於維繫希臘各城邦的感情以及訓練希人的尚武精神，曾有過極大的貢獻。其起源如何，很難考證。比較可靠的說法是：古代希臘有四個重要的節日，其中之一便呌奧林匹克運動會，是專用來紀念天空之神，一切衆神及人類之父的。當時的運動會，參加比賽的人，必須是純希臘的血統者；希臘爲羅馬征服後，羅馬人也就有權參加了。在最初的十三次奧林匹克大會中，競賽節目只有賽跑一項，其後逐漸增加到廿四項，計有長短距離賽跑·角力·拳擊·戰車賽跑·賽馬·披甲賽跑等。過去的奧林匹克大會，和平氣味很濃厚，每屆開會的時候，必放出大批銀色信鴿，飛到當時正在交戰的城邦去宣佈大會開幕的消息，並呼籲交戰者立即止戈停戰。這種宗教底神意底感化，曾在很短的歷程中發生效力，時間久了，交戰的權威幷不接受它的感化。公元前四九〇年波希之戰，雅典大軍在馬拉松前綫作戰，勇士費狄茲南歸報捷，後來成爲體育節目上有名的「馬拉松賽跑」，就表徼和平意義的消失。所以說奧林匹克的和平意義，祗是象徽的，可望而不可及了。</p>
<p>同時，古希臘的奧林匹克運動會，又是一種宗教·藝術·政治·和社會運動的綜合表現，運動塲上培養出來的「運動員精神」，逐漸滲進了希臘文化的血液中，於是爲古代文明搖籃的愛琴海畔，洋溢着自·活潑·民主·進步的光輝，這種光　給後世人類帶來無限的幸福。不幸的是：從公元前七七六年計算起的奧林匹克運動會，於舉行了二九三屆後，接着便於紀元三九四年被羅馬國王迪奥多休斯一世下令强迫停止舉行了。這是人類的黑暗時代，一直到一八九六年四月六日，復活節後的第一屆世界運動會在雅典宣告揭幕，人類又復走上和平團結的道路。以後每四年或二年舉行一次，在不同的國家召集；第六屆世運會本應於一九一六年舉行，不幸因第一次世界大戰而停止。一九二〇年在安特衛普舉行第七屆。最値得稱述的，是一九三六年在柏林舉行的第十一屆，也是在本屆（十四屆）大會前最後一屆，正式恢復了「奧林匹克之火」，燃燒着光明。第十二屆原定一九四〇年在東京舉行，因爲日本發動侵華戰爭，接着一九三九年歐洲遍地條火，十二屆世運會便停止舉行。一九四四年第二次世界大戰正在進行，所以十三屆世運會也宣告延期了。</p>
<p>現在大戰結束已三年，人們又以愉快的心情迎接第十四屆世運會了。今天的世界，在戰亂恐怖愁雲慘霧中，儘管强權政治的「冷戰」，表現在世界的任何一角落，中國希臘的人民更陷於水深火熱中，可是人類總是向着進步的方向走，呼籲和平，要求安定，爭取民主，奔向自由。一個和平象徽的奧林匹克大會，今天可能被世界的人類重視，這是重視它神聖的意議，光明與偉大，祥和與安定。我們中國人民，今天生活在一個苦難的時代；我們的理智要求着光明，我們願望「奧林匹克之火」燃燒着放射着光輝，爲苦難者帶來幸福；我們願見銀色信鴿飛翔在我們廣漢的大地，帶來可喜的消息。我們並願從今　起，光明的火炬，驅走殺人的惡魔；我們的長江黄河，我們的黑出白水，開遍了鮮艷之花，幸福之果。</p>
<p>我們接迎世界運動會的到來，我們歡呼歌唱：和平！目由！民主！進步！我們祝賀中國代表團健兒們的愉快健康，我們要在今天高舉起中華民國靑天白日滿地紅的大旗，巡行於各國家各種族各人民之前，獲得歡呼，獲得同情。我們並不一定需要競取錦標，我們只是需要公理與正義，文明與光輝！我們慶祝第十四屆奧林匹克大會在莊嚴瑰麗中揭慕，我們慶祝摩登時代的來到。我們歡呼！我們歌唱！</p>

<h3>美英法大使今晤莫洛托夫　提出聯合新照會　冀促成四強談判德問題</h3>
<p>〔合衆社倫敦廿八日電〕美駐蘇大使史密斯，已於今日晚乘專機赴草斯科，預料廿九日可抵莫斯科，史氏專機曾於午夜在柏林停留片刻。</p>
<p>又電：英外相貝文之私人秘書羅伯茲，廿八日離倫敦此莫斯科，與美法代表共同將西方覆文送交克林姆宮。羅氏原爲駐蘇公使，將偕駐德英軍司令羅勃森同機飛柏林，然後與美駐蘇大使史密斯將軍同飛莫斯科。</p>
<p>〔合衆社倫敦廿八日電〕據權威方面稱：美法·英三國駐蘇大使，將於廿九日在莫斯科以倫敦會議之對蘇關係決議，告知蘇外長莫洛托夫。彼等將擲下戰爭結束以還最大之賭注，此項賭注可能爲和平抑戰爭，但幷不一定是立刻和平或者立刻戰爭。然彼等又稱，此一對蘇之新交涉與蘇聯之答覆，可爲局勢轉佳或轉惡之轉捩點。此一口頭照會乃事前極愼重及準備甚久以處理之，以前美政府各部門從未對外交行動有如此注重者。一般預料美·英·法三國大使將坦白地向莫洛托夫稱，彼等之政府準備開始與蘇聯談判德國問題，一俟柏林封鎖解除之後。此項談判幷不是四强外長會議將立刻召開之謂，蓋四强外長會議之籌備工作須費時甚久。一般預料西方强國將首先建議經由正常外交途徑及對德管制委員會談判。</p>
<p>〔合衆社倫教廿八日電〕權威方面稱，史密斯將代表美·英·法·三國向莫洛托夫口頭提出交涉，指出封鎖柏林實違反聯合國憲章第二條之規定即「聯合國會員應以和平方式解決爭端，並須以不危害國際和平，安全與公正之方式行之」。此係美·英·法·三國倫教會議所獲得之決定。西方强國間無疑已獲得協議，可能於最後同意召開四强會議，或向聯合國提出柏林事件但在現階段中，西方强國已同意延遲任何足以使四强外長會議重開或向聯合國申訴之行動。</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕級約廿八日廣播：華府訊：馬歇爾告記者稱：美國已與英法二國就柏林問題取得協議，但拒絕透露此一協議之內容。同時對三國政府是否已訓令三國駐蘇大使，直接向莫洛托夫商討柏林局勢一節，亦不願加以證實或否認。</p>
<h3>共和黨企圖打擊杜魯門　決採取拖延政策　擬要求國會休會使計劃成泡影</h3>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓廿七日電〕杜魯門總統所召集以建立反通貨膨脹等立法案之美國會特別會議，廿七日反使杜魯門受打擊，蓋共和黨諸領袖指斥杜氏之計劃，具有政洽目的，而正發動迅速休會之攻勢。彼等事實上將使杜氏各項要求之希望歸於泡影。共和黨諸領袖以電話與該黨總統候選人杜威商討後，答應考慮杜魯門之計劃。但彼等明白表示，彼等不擬將其中任何一項計劃成爲立法案，並謂彼等計劃於兩週內停止會議而返家。</p>
<p>此外彼等並將衆院所通過之反人頭稅法案，置於參院議程上第一項討論之問題，因此在任何行動之大道中，設置巨大障礙物。同時民主黨參議員强斯頓（南加羅里那州）已準備提出休會建議，渠係南部十一州反對杜氏種族權利要求之民主黨叛變議員之領袖。共和黨諸領袖舉行策略會議後，即覆以千餘字之政策宣言，痛斥總統之召集特會爲一企圖連任總統之政治手段」。彼等指斥民主黨政府應負目前物價高漲之咎，並申述彼等願將此事交全國人民在十一月大選時定奪之。杜魯門前曾告顯含敵意之國會稱，國會必須制止通貨膨脹，否則自負不眾氣慘劇之咎。渠要求迅速通過過分利得稅之徵收·工資與物價之限制·賦以分配制之權力·以及其他各項措置，以「制止高漲之物價」。渠並要求在目前而不在明年對建造居屋計劃採取行動，且列舉其他儿項主要內政問題。</p>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓廿七日電〕參院共各黨政策委員會主席塔虎脫之語，可代表共和黨之反應，渠稱，「考慮總統之全部計劃，將費時六個月之久」，而「此三點僅强調下列事實，即特別議會之召開，顯具有政治目的」。</p>
<p>杜魯門提案　工會表贊同</p>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓廿七日電〕工會今日對杜魯門總統致國會之咨文，加以贊同。工協與勞聯之發言人稱，總統之提案包括彼等一千三百會員所擁護之法律之大部。但對工資管制提案，均不甚熱心，工協方面，則明白表示反對此種管制，聲稱，仔細研究通貨膨脹之結果，證明工資並非其原因。工會發言人一致認爲特別會議將使投票者於十一月大選時能判斷議員之成績。</p>
<h3>美陸軍仍堅持　黑白人分營　總統命令窒碍難行</h3>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓廿八日電〕美陸軍廿八日仍堅持黑白人種分營之原來立塲。參謀部官員稱，總統雖下令禁止種族或其他「歧視」，然陸軍認爲執行此一命令，不必實行不分營制度，蓋總統並未禁止分營制度。又稱，陸軍之一切行動，均待總統委員會之建議。又稱，國防部長福萊斯特將根據上項建議，製成三軍一體遵守之計劃·對此一事，陸長羅雅爾簡捷了當稱，「無可奉告」。陸軍參謀長勃書特萊則稱，「陸軍並不提倡什麼社會改革，陸軍仍將把不同種族的人分別編開。全國改變這制度的時候，我們也會改的」。</p>
<h3>貝文留倫敦　取消假期旅行</h3>
<p>〔中央社倫敦廿七日電〕値茲重要之三國會議本日賡續於此間進行之際，英下院領袖莫里遜正式宣佈稱，原定明日進行之下院外交辯論，將不如期舉行，但貝文外相將於廿九日「盡共可能發表詳盡之聲明」。鑒於危急之國際局勢，貝文外相本日於與艾德禮首相會商後，決定取消渠原定明日赴馬爾太之三週休假旅行。</p>
<h3>霍夫曼離歐返美</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社巴黎廿八日電〕美經濟合作總署署長霍夫曼，今晚八時將乘飛機離巴黎返華盛頓。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社白魯寒爾廿七日電〕比參院已以一〇八對共黨之一三票，批准歐洲經濟合作公約，及比美關於實行馬歇爾計劃之雙邊協定。</p>
<h3>南斯拉夫領袖表示　願與美經濟合作　阿保南聯盟計劃不放棄</h3>
<p>〔美國新聞社貝爾格勒廿七日電〕南斯拉夫第一任副總理卡台爾奇，星期一在此間告共黨大會稱，南斯拉夫主張以平等之地位，與世界各國實行經濟合作。在卡台爾奇發表此一聲明之前，南總理狄托本人於接見現在歐洲遊歷之前任加州州長奧爾遜（華萊士派）時，亦發表類似之意見。據稱，狄托曾告奧爾遜謂，南斯拉夫願與美國展開貿易關係，但不願因此一目標而在政治上有所讓步。</p>
<p>狄托又稱，渠擬以事實應付共產國際情報局，證明渠所領導之共黨未嘗有錯誤</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社貝爾格勒廿八日電〕南共黨大會關於與阿爾巴尼亞及保加利亞組成聯邦之政綱，經大會一致通過。此項政綱並非立即求其實現，因保阿兩國政治家最近曾發表聲明痛斥此事也。該政綱並主張與其他民主國家進行更進一步之密切合作。</p>
<p>支持希游擊隊</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社貝爾格勒廿八日電〕南斯拉夫總理公署之新聞局長今晨告南共大會稱，一吾人重申南共大會將支持希臘之爲獨立及爲一切民主國家之安全而作戰。」此項宣言引起大會代表一致之喝采。</p>
<p>維持對蘇友誼</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社貝爾格勒廿七日電〕南國外次貝伯勒今日在共黨大會宣稱，南國與蘇聯所訂之友好條約，仍爲南國外交政策之基礎。又謂南國在國際會議中常受帝國主義國之壓迫，此殊不合人民民主主義。南國在蘇聯之後爲資本主義國所最厭惡者，南國在人民民主國中爲最後收回存美黄金之國，甚至曾受甚巨之折扣。甫國曾於上年十二日間向國際銀行告貸而一無所獲，但其他人民民主國則獲得借款以供彼此貿易之用。南國外交政策不僅僅因共產情報局之誤會而予變更，吾人決不背離蘇聯與其他人民民主國，南斯拉夫之狄托元帥非世界之黄金所能傾動。</p>
<h3>蘇佔區兌換新幣　昨發生嚴重騷亂</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕倫敦廿八日廣播柏林訊：柏林蘇聯佔區內，刻因數萬人民擁擠於銀行門前兌換新幣而發生騷亂。新舊貨幣兌換期限，定廿八日晚截止。當騷亂發生以後，蘇聯即行嫁罪於非共產黨之柏林市政府，責其未能於事先設立足够之兌換所，使兌換新幣之人民得避免擁擠，從而阻止騷亂之發生。但美國軍政府之官員則謂，柏林市政府爲一「替罪之羔羊」。同時四方佔領區內之報紙更公開指責蘇聯此舉，目的在榨取德人之錢財。</p>

<p>〔合衆社柏林廿八日電〕一般人預料蘇方不久則將在宣傳後宣佈市政府已不存在，而在柏林蘇佔區成立共黨控制之行政機關。如此，西方將不得不承認柏林之分裂。英美當局均强調雖蘇聯一再挑撥，西方決不主動促取市政府之崩潰。</p>

<h3>杜威的智囊團</h3>
<p>— ·章礝石譯·</p>
<p>其他的人物，也許全美國中不很知名的，但是他們却有與杜威一起組閣的希望。其預料的情形如下：</p>
<p>洛克伍特，是杜威的智囊幽之一，今年四十六歲，他是杜威的行政顧問，如果共和黨當選，可能被任命爲白宮的首席秘書。他有決定誰可不可以去見杜威的權力。洛克伍特是身材魁梧而又和藹的人物，曾操律師業。他是在一九三五年控告紐約流氓時加入杜威智囊團的。</p>
<p>海奇臺，曾任「紐約時報」的採訪員，今年卅九歲。他不與羅斯福政權時的歐萊，和杜魯門政權下的羅斯相似，他是沒有華盛頓報人的經驗的。他與杜成的感情很好。</p>
<p>四十歲的勃頓，是目前杜威州長的預算指導人，他當杜威任總統時，可能任命為美國預算局的指導人。却潑曼今年四十四歲，在一九四六年時，初就任爲紐約稅務局長，他是杜成的金融顧問之一。　斯，今年五十九歲，他是計劃專家，自然可能任相當的任務。</p>
<p>上面所述的，是杜威內部的人物。其餘各部的人物，他需要向共和黨的大家庭中去找。</p>
<p>國防部長一職，可能由六十八歲的賓夕凡尼亞籍參議員馬丁擔任。其次有希望的，乃是華盛頓籍參議員凱恩。</p>
<p>農務部長一職，可能由霍潑擔任，他今年五十五歲，坎薩斯籍，現任農務委員會主席。其次有希望的，乃是梅友。他是康奈爾大學院長，從前做過農業信託貸款組織的管理人。費格森是密歇根籍參議員，可能檢察長</p>
<p>威尼馬斯今年四十七歲，是奧勒岡　參議員，他可能在杜威當選後出任內務部長。米爾根，今年五十七歲，是卡羅里達籍的參議員，雖然在費城大會之前，他是支持塔虎脫者，但是他却也有被任命爲內政部長或其他重要工作的希望。可是，他留任在參議院的希望也很大。</p>
<p>史泰遜今年四十一歲，曾在競選總統候選人中失敗，但是他加入杜威政權的呼聲也是很高。</p>
<p>霍夫曼今年五十七歲。他從前是經營汽車事業，現任援歐總署署長。他可能在杜威任總統後，被任命爲商務部長，但是他也有可能留任援歐總署署長，假如他願意這樣做的話。</p>
<p>密爾頓艾森豪威，今年四十九歲，他是艾森豪威元帥的兄弟，現任坎薩斯州學院的院長，他可能出任教育部長或衛生部長。</p>
<p>當杜威當選總統之後，白宮的主要人物也可能變爲淸一色的紐約人當政。現在我們不管杜威就任總統之後的情形怎樣，總之，如果杜威當選下任總統，在新人物新政策的情形之下，他可能會好好地幹一番的。（下）（譯自美國世界新聞七月號）</p>

<h3>奧林匹克運動會的原始　和近代世運大會的復興</h3>
<p>〔本報特寫〕奧林匹克運動會的原始及起因，早已泯不可老，從公元前七七六年伊菲塔斯之被稱爲「復興」奧林匹克一點推測，奧林匹克創始迄今，已在二千七百年以上。</p>
<p>奧林匹克運動會自伊菲塔斯重起爐灶後，綿亙了十三世紀，到公元三九四年，主辦人羅馬王蘇杜撒斯鑑於競賽者道德之日趨下洗，爲了奪取錦標，往往不惜以種種卑劣手段，加諸同賽者身上。認爲提倡體育，聯絡感情的原來精神，已喪失殆盡，因此下令永禁奧林匹克之舉行。不久，速希臘萬神之王奧林匹斯的神像，也予以焚毀，奧林匹克也因此停頓了千五百餘年。</p>
<p>近代奧林　匹克復活</p>
<p>近代奧林匹克之得以復活，成爲四年一度，哄動全球的盛事，不得不歸功於法國一位軍人兼學者古伯汀爵士。爵士從軍隊中觀察到健全的體格，非出諸體育訓練不可，更從希臘史中研究出古代國家的陵替，也和奧林匹克有莫大關聯，於是從事於發動偉大的世界運動會的計劃，希望世蓮能够溝通各國的文化，消除各民族間的閡隔，從而使世界兵　永絕，獲致永久和平。</p>
<p>一八九三年，爵士發動第一步計劃，以私人名義，致函各國體育界領袖，建議翌年在巴黎集會，討論復與奧林匹克的進行方法。會議結果，一致通過於一八九六年舉辦近代第一屆世運會，並規定此後每四年舉行一次。</p>
<p>第一屆在　雅典舉行</p>
<p>第一屆世運會，爲紀念古代奧林匹克起見，便在希臘京城雅典舉行。由於一位貴胄的捐助，一座在當時已嘆爲美侖美奐，雄壯偉麗的大理石大運動塲，便在這古文化之都建立起來。</p>
<p>經過了一番艱鉅籌備工作，近代的奧林匹克終於揭幕了，一切草創伊始，參加角逐的只有十二單位，項目也都因陋就簡，但是已經喚起了全世界有識之士的注意，爲以後幾屆世運開下了一條康莊大道。</p>
<p>之後，第二·三·四·五屆每四年一次分別在巴黎，聖路易士·倫敦·和斯德哥爾摩舉行。雖然第三屆因爲路途遙遠，而且日俄大戰正在展開，時局動盪，所以僅有八單位參加，但是，世運確是一次比一次有進步地趨向完美之境。</p>
<p>歐洲戰火　燬滅世運</p>
<p>古伯汀爵士的理想被粉碎了，一九一六年，奧林匹克非但沒有消滅戰火，反給戰火焚燬，第六屆大會就此洗產。</p>
<p>一九二〇年第七屆大會在大戰中受戰神蹂躪得最慘的比利時京城舉行，參加單位廿五，項目一百十七，打破了前幾屆的紀錄。</p>
<p>一九二四年巴黎二次接辦大會，參加國家達四十五，項目也漸臻完備。</p>
<p>第九屆世運在荷蘭京城阿姆斯托坦舉行，分隷四十三國的四千選手，參加角逐，九屆大會作了一次大阻也是成功的嘗試，首次設立女子田徑項目。</p>
<p>我國歷史　性的嘗試</p>
<p>一九三二年世界經濟危機達最高峰聲中，第十屆大會在洛杉磯舉行，雖然由於經濟關係，各國遣派選手數目，遠不及前數屆龐大，但是質的方面，却遠非已往任何一屆所能及。羣英大會中，十六項世界紀錄和廿五項大會紀錄全被粉碎。我國也作了一次歷史性的嘗試，破天荒的派了一名選手劉長春參加，雖然以先後天的關係，名落孫山，但是，在國際觀瞻上，卻也一新外人耳目，糾正不少外人劉中國的荒謬想像。</p>
<p>首次大戰後，日趨富强的德國，接辦了一九三六年的第十一屆大會，日耳曼人科學的頭腦和奮鬥的精神，使這屆大會堪稱空前。最大的運動塲和設備最週的世運村，使五十一國的選手，曁萬千來自各地的遊客嘆爲觀止。可借，最令人痛心的是這個全球性的大會，物質上已達到頂點，但是精神上的收檴，郤是貧乏得可憐。瘋狂的戰火又趕走了和平之神，第十二·十三兩屆大會，就夭折在胎裏。</p>
<p>戰後第一屆大會，已定今日在倫敦揭幕，這次大會，實際算來，僅是第十二次，但從一八九六年算起，已經是第十四屆「奧林匹亞、」（Olmpiad希臘文，原義四週年的一階段）了。（鑫）</p>

<h3>剪燭新談（在南京）</h3>
<p>— 白永</p>
<p>三天必有一天斷电，今晚又是黑暗世界，陰雲蔽空，望日的月亮也沒有光。室內溫度一百度，大家在院裏乘凉，雖不見得有什麽淸風，到底空氣洗動些，無奈雨又來了，只好剪西窗之燭，僧帽牌每支的售價已達五十萬，然而也沒有法子。</p>
<p>偏巧客人來了，正合古人剪燭話夜雨之句。兩位來客，說是「舊雨」也可，〔新雨」也可；舊兩者，本來大家都是窮同鄉，說話有一致之處；新雨者，他們已竟由窮人一躍而成「老板」，與我這白髮書生老死牖下又有上下床之別。不過聽聽那些「野談」，却也不失爲一點史料，「因此　而爲之記。」</p>
<p>甲客：「今天猪肉九十萬，一斤只有十五兩；可也沒有一定，水西門就賣八十，彩霞街六十四，新橋七十二。你看，什麼算標準！黃豆芽全不一樣價，十二萬，十萬，還有十五萬的！」</p>
<p>我：「這個不談也罷。聽說你近來很發財，究竟作什麼生意？」</p>
<p>乙客：「你還不知道麽？他近來販牲畜，上一次就是是三十多億！」</p>
<p>我：「唔？怎麼販法？」</p>
<p>乙（向甲微笑）：「江北今年大水，宿縣一帶更不行，再加打仗，牲口全賤價出售，一匹馬不過五千萬，到南京穩賺一億多，鄉下人好欺哄，不一定付現款，買定了先付一百二百的，餘下打期票，賒欠十天半月不算甚麼，你一轉手間，可就嫌得元寳翻身了。」</p>
<p>甲（不安，又自得的）：「不要聽他亂說。他半月前囤汽油，如今已竟兩倍利息啦，今天又托我買舊油桶，上禮拜一只桶四十萬，不料這幾天漲到二百二，還是罐頭鐵片改製的。你知道爲什麽？公敎人員配油，大家都要買聽頭去領，市塲上就起了大波動。眞是，瓦片也有翻身之日！」</p>
<p>我：「倒想不到，你一向作舊書生意，看不起黃金現洋的，爲什麽如今也閙起這個來了？」</p>
<p>乙；「書還能賣嗎？白報紙一令五千幾，一張就賣到頭二十萬，隨便一本書也得百萬出頭，就是有錢，誰肯買這些東西？舊書更不行了，一則沒有人念，二則價錢也漲不上去。你看，狀元境那些舊書店全稱斤出售了，架子上全是馮玉奇小說，洗行歌曲，我們這些講宋元版本的更是談也不要談！幾家從北平新來的店家，滿打算到江南淘淘金，結果還不是大失所望？肯動腦筋的，不賣新書，也改回文具了，你看，派克自來水筆不就等於美匯嗎？我們這一點小意思，算什麽！」</p>
<p>我聰呆了，不知如何回答。</p>
<p>剛好乙抽完一支烟，剩了半根烟屁股丟在地下：「你不要看不起這烟屁股，論價錢也有千把塊，從前一所房子，如今就輕輕的丟了！</p>
<p>大家哄堂笑起來。</p>
<p>雨止了，兩個格子紡的身影消失在陰暗中。</p>
<p>我一面聽雨聲，一面盤算着本月份的生活指數，到底該給多少倍呢？</p>
<p>一般的歐美男子路遇婦女時，都自然的脫帽爲禮，日子久了，大家都認爲這是一個習慣上的事情，很少再想到其中所蘊藏的尊重異性的意義。事實上，這種對婦女脫帽的習慣是從一種古代的法律演變而來的，這種法律的主旨是强逼「一切的小人在大人面前都應脫赗爲禮，以示尊重。」</p>
<p>這條律文還可追溯到更早的剝褫戰爭俘虜的衣服的習慣。古代的亞述人把一切的戰俘都剝掉衣服，表明他們的完全被征服。因此，裸體被認作是一種禮拜的形式。直到現在，裸體表示尊重「大人」的習慣，依然存在於一些原始的部落民族中</p>
<p>當西方人逐漸文明起來的時候，這種習慣形式上稍加改變，仍被傳留下來。在武士制度時代，武士在公然出現時都是全身披甲的。不過，當友善的武士們相遇時，他們就把面盔除掉，表示相識和尊重。而當這些武士們遇到一位閨秀時，却更會將甲胃完全却脫。他們如此做是表示敬意，或者表現自已的廬山眞面目。無論如何，毫無疑義的，武士們不知不覺的已把「小人」尊重「大人」的習慣傳到了後代。</p>
<p>當武士制度衰微時，男子們改戴帽子了，他們保留了武士的對婦女移除頭盔的習慣。</p>
<p>敎友派信徒對這種習慣有點反感，他們拒絕對女子脫帽。因爲他們認爲他們祗有一位「大人一，那就是上帝。</p>

<h3>漫談靜安寺</h3>
<p>— 陳左高</p>
<p>靜安寺者，清末逭暑消夏之勝境也。每臨盛暑，游人踵接。逮日下沈彩，團扇輕衫，結隊而至。或携眷，或挾姬，朱軒掛轉，雕輪擊　，甚至宵深時候，松聲竹韻之中，猶有遺釵墮珥。今寺前有古井，位處一路電車站旁，題曰天下第六泉。淸光緒間，上更築茶樓。中法戰爭之名臣唐景崧，嘗偕潮州秀才蕭稻農，坐馬車至寺觀古井；泉形如沸，歲時皆然。登樓用茶餅，「裙釵繞座，楚楚可人，風寒不耐坐而歸。」見請纓日記光緒十二年十月廿三日記</p>
<p>申園位於寺　。黃協塤淞南夢影錄稱其地畫棟珠簾，朝飛暮捲，極見樓閣宏敞，陳設精良。游倦則倚雕闌，啜苦茗，清風颯至，俗慮俱消。時或隔座花枝，向人招展，釵聲鈿影，髣髦簾中，每爲誦元相「醉聞花起睡聞鶯，」低徊不能去云。樓下設彈子檯數張，月下亦可輸贏互角。兼備西餐，客須預訂，藉免倉卒中，無以應耳。一說：淪茗時，且有校書說唱佐興。滬上詞塲竹枝詞所謂：「有約申園共品茶，匆匆登座弄琵琶，曲終便下歌樓去，門下盈盈駐馬車。」蓋即指此。</p>
<p>三二年前，吾浙宿儒，輒當來復暇日，假寺殿茶叙，至者如高野侯丁輔之等諸前輩；予間亦叨列末座，飫領　談。遙想寺當昔時，花稠錦疊，永軟塵香，異致絢爛，不一而足，而今則寺地日狹，景物全非，附近屋宇鱗比，車輛輻輳，鮑明遠所謂四通五達渚是。噫，際茲鬧市喧鬧，誰復以勝蹟目之！撫今思往，能無滄桑之感耶？</p>
<h3>愛</h3>
<p>— 晉霖</p>
<p>有愛才有生命。——羅曼羅蘭</p>
<p>眞正的愛，是培植在敬重上面的。——白金漢</p>
<p>愛可以施捨，但不是買得的。——郎費洛</p>
<p>恨，能挑啟爭端；愛，能遮掩一切過錯。——聖經箴言</p>
<h3>娘姨問題</h3>
<p>— 起鳳</p>
<p>在戰前，僱一二個娘姨不算一回事，可是如今在物價高漲的時代，娘姨的問題却相當的嚴重了。</p>
<p>對於娘姨，據我從親友的主婦們口中探悉，大半是抱怨異常，每有不用不行，用了生氣之感。因爲現在娘姨再也不像以前的那樣「忠順」了。時代已灌輸給她們新的知識，對於幣値的低落和物價的狂漲已有了明確迅速的瞭解，她們已不是一批可以欺侮的未受過敎育的鄉下人了。</p>
<p>目前娘姨之間雖還不至於進步到組織同業公會，可是她們消息傳遞之靈通，却不亞於一個完善的組織。一條弄中，某家的工錢多少，某家的工錢以什麼計算，都打聽得明明白白；假如有同鄉或姊妹淘在別的地段的，她們也時常聚會，互相討論工錢的問題。如果你工錢出得少，她會拿某家的工錢來和你比較，要你加，否則的話，她會找一個很有理由的謊話，在同鄉·朋友的介紹之下，跳到別家去。若不滿足，則再跳。所以往往你家的娘姨走了說是回鄉去，經過了一個相當的時期却會在你的親戚或朋友處發現，那時眞有啼笑皆非之感。</p>
<p>至於工錢，現在拿講好固定工錢的似乎是最落後最忠厚的一種，雖然主婦會加，可是總加不足。第二種以米爲標準，一月三斗四斗不等，她們日日望米上漲。第三種是以生活指數爲標準，每月六元七元「底薪」都有，物價的高漲影饗不了她們，可是這種幾何級數的上漲，將來可能弄得主人不勝負擔。最後一種是以美金計算的，大凡知道主人的進益是以美金折算的話，當然她們也就趁此提出這種要求了。</p>
<p>娘姨進步得實在太快了。賢明的主婦，你們得考慮，假如你的娘姨向你提出後三種的工錢計算的要求時，你怎樣應付呢？</p>
<h3>果名</h3>
<p>— 公孫午</p>
<p>波羅非波羅蜜，辭源辨析甚明，果肆主人或有所不知耳。我國雖大，今已統一，台灣亦已收回，而貨運復較昔爲便，家珍名目，似不可以路隔山海而混淆，尤不宜以立異爲得。佳物容有別名，然實不便稱說，未聞加州·澳洲之果類，至紐約·倫敦而易名；若有混稱，何異指鹿爲馬。即如葵扇，上海市上名以芭蕉扇，葵扇多來自新會，然江蘇廣東，相距非遠，何故必易其名。上海公國有芭蕉數株，圖畫中常見蕉樹，古人且有以蕉葉書字者，此與壓平曝乾爲扇之葵葉，豈爲同物。王沂孫會稽人也，其詞有「葵箑難留」句，葵之爲葵，宋人已知之矣。葡萄植於廣東，早熟而酸潞，粵人誤稱作菩提子，甚可鄙笑，以南方別有一物名與葡萄二字同音，故謬爲分別。茄字有二音，在番茹，宜讀伽音，而上海人喜讀加音，番又漸較爲審。此物在北方，或稱火柿子，常物乃有多名，足證語言統一之猶有待。柚之有文旦，朱樂，雖云少異，實不必强分，用一柚字足矣。橙·柑·桔·金橘四物皆橘類，又不可不分也。</p>
<p>###</p>
<p>大赦一事，傳說已久，議論多歧。或從職權解釋（如立法院應否提案之疑問，司法院以爲可），或從事實立言（如法院長夏君謂大赦不宜太多），或嫌封建遺痕，或且偏注「漢奸一面，然考歷史前例，並井純屬在上者之恩惠關係，亦非只罪人之刑罰减免問題。夫「赦」日「大赦」，即有普遍性，其眞正之目的，乃是一咸與維新」，有政治上最高至善之意義。</p>
<p>原來罪人之罪行，一大半是客觀的條件所釀成。西方文明日進，刑罰逐漸减輕，又有「感化」有「緩刑」，儘可能的昭跡原情，敎導向上，皆與道德哲學政治原理相輔而行。罪犯之向上，即是治人階級知識階級共同的進步。文明國家之異於野　者在此。中國先哲常稱道「下車泣罪」，「得其情則哀矜而勿喜」，亦都有原諒及互相譴責之義。普通的犯罪原因，如「經濟壓迫」（所謂　寒起盜心），則責在失政；如知識低下（貪詐暴戾，皆由教育不足），則責在失教。故每屆秋讞大典，古帝王减膳素服，以表歉意。</p>
<p>至於大赦，僅是一　恩」之一種。「大赦」並不限於帝王慶典，而帝王慶典之「皇恩」，亦不只「大赦」一端。故「大赦」與「皇恩」不能併作一談。歷史最有名的大赦莫過於唐代之一興元一認，由陸宣公執筆公布，武夫悍卒亦爲之感泣，乃因文字誠懇公明，表明上下一體，除朱泚外，雖朱滔効順，亦與維新，而　陌。間架。竹木。榷鐵所加稅錢，悉行停罷，又實惠及民。故赦書旣頒，四方大悅，以情轉向，危而復安。此外史書所載赦例，如天變示警，水旱災　，及非常禍亂，輙下詔條省，上下交敝，或奏刑罰太繁，獄訟失平，上干天和，則慮因减刑，於輕罪成可疑者，儘量釋放，亦大赦之意。旣日「咸與維新」，即有治人階級已往的責任，不但被赦老方面有自新的機會，而施赦者一方面，亦須自己新新自己！</p>
<p>帝工慶典之大赦，亦不限於新君即位。如宋太祖丙子三月幸西京祭天地，老民相語，我　少經離亂，今日復覩太平，有泣下者。祭畢大赦，以表同慶。時距庚申宋祖即位已十餘年矣。次年太宗即位，改元「太平興國」，又大赦一次，亦共享太平之義。</p>
<p>近代如前淸皇帝登極，以「覃恩」爲第一義。覃亦廣大普及之義，與大赦之「大」略同。覃恩之第一要件，爲「恩科慶榜」，每帝必行。而太后及皇帝之萬壽，亦以「恩科」爲首。再則官員晋級加何，寬免公罪處分，廢員之隨班祝嚴者，分別給以職銜，耆民老農，由地方官查給頂戴花紅，欠賦及災荒之處，分別减免綫糧，總是薄沾關澤，大赦有無，反不甚注意。民國以來，總統就職，郤有些仿古帝正大赦者，十四年段麒端爲臨時執政，亦來一次大赦令，援例除十惡不赦外，普通罪犯分別减免，而特提曹錕不在赦免之列。時京報社長邵先生作社評，深謫其非。曹錕無論如何，不能與放火決水之重犯同論，且曹氏被困於新華宮，旣未經審判，更未有罪名，則赦不赦根本無從說起。故民國之大赦，可笑者莫過於「段執政」。</p>

<h3>President Weng's Announcement to the Nation: Discern Right from Wrong and Overcome National Crisis Together; The Chinese Communists Are Indeed Controlled by the Communist International</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 28th] Premier Weng Wenhao has issued a letter to the nation, titled "Discern Right from Wrong and Overcome National Crisis Together." The full text is as follows:</p>
<p>Our country is suffering from the destruction and disturbances caused by the Chinese Communists. The Central Government originally hoped to negotiate sincerely and compromise painstakingly in order to avoid the use of force. Unfortunately, the Chinese Communists stubbornly adhere to their prejudices, unwilling to embark on the path of constitutionalism, and are determined to expand their troops, seize local power, disrupt social order, and devastate the lives and property of the people, resulting in a dangerous situation that shakes the foundation of the nation. For the sake of consolidating the foundation of the nation and protecting the people, the government has been forced to decide to implement suppression of the rebellion in order to quell the bandits who betray the country.</p>
<p>Those who follow the Communist Party are originally Chinese people, and their love for the country and their intentions as good citizens should be the same. What is unfortunate is that these people are coerced by the power of the Chinese Communist bandits, forced to embark on the wrong path, and jointly engage in activities that endanger the country and harm the people. Therefore, all actions should be the responsibility of the Chinese Communist bandits. Why do the Chinese Communists insist on endangering the country and harming the people? It is because the Chinese Communists are part of the world communist movement. Every action and every propaganda of the Chinese Communists is based on the opinions of the Communist International, and is always consistent without the slightest difference. This can be fully demonstrated by the resolution issued by the Chinese Communists on the 10th of this month to accept the punishment of the Yugoslav Communist Party by the Communist International Information Bureau.</p>
<p>The so-called Communist International Information Bureau was established by representatives of communist parties from nine European countries at a meeting held in Warsaw, Poland, in late September last year. The original address of the bureau was in Belgrade, the capital of Yugoslavia. On October 5th, they jointly issued a declaration accusing the United States, Britain, and France of being aggressor countries, and demanded that communist countries be responsible for protecting the territory and sovereignty of other countries. They also recognized that US aid to Western Europe, South America, and China was evidence of aggression against other countries, and that communist countries must thoroughly break down this type of work. In the summer of this year, the US Congress decided on various foreign aid measures. Communist representatives from eight European countries met again in Warsaw to discuss methods of attacking and undermining US aid. At the same time, they condemned and announced the crimes of the Yugoslav Communists and formally expelled the Yugoslav Communist Party from the party. This kind of behavior by the European Communist International was originally aimed at Europe and did not mention China. However, the Chinese Communists echoed in unison and issued a statement on July 10th, severely criticizing the Yugoslav Communists and ordering the bandit cadres to "seriously study the resolution of the Communist International Information Bureau on the Yugoslav Communist issue, in order to strengthen the party's education on class, party, and internationalist self-criticism, spirit, and discipline." This kind of unanimous response proves that the Chinese Communists are indeed under the control of another central force of the Communist International.</p>
<p>We know that the Chinese Communists use harsh reviews and brutal purges as means of execution for the "education" and "self-criticism" of their party members. Moreover, the Chinese Communists' resolution clarifies discipline, which shows that this review and purge will be extremely harsh and cruel in order to eradicate the only remaining thread of national consciousness within the party and not allow the slightest residue to remain. Originally, the Chinese Communist Party was already a branch of the Communist International. Its party members must be loyal to the Communist International and carry out the orders of the Communist International. This was already clearly stipulated in its party constitution and the Communist Party oath of its members. Therefore, it is not surprising that the bandit party accepted the Communist International's condemnation of the Yugoslav Communists and took this opportunity to deepen the discipline of controlling party members.</p>
<h3>The Critical Moment of Survival as Masters or Slaves: No Room for Hesitation or Doubt; The Bandits' Endangering of the Country and Harming of the People Has Solid Proof</h3>
<p>The Communist International Information Bureau condemned the Yugoslav Communists and pointed out several crimes, which further confirmed that many slogans of the Communist Party are shameless deceptions. The first crime of the Yugoslav Communists is to promote nationalism. Since the Chinese Communists have accepted this decision, they have fundamentally negated nationalism. The second crime of the Yugoslav Communists is to allow representatives of the petty bourgeoisie and farmers and workers to represent the whole country, replacing the one-party dictatorship of the Communist Party. Since the Chinese Communists have accepted this decision, it can be seen that their call for a "democratic coalition government" is just a smokescreen for their political conspiracy. The third crime of the Yugoslav Communists is to allow private ownership of land and allow people to buy and sell land. Since the Chinese Communists have accepted this decision, it can be seen that their propaganda of appeasing rich peasants and stabilizing middle peasants has become an empty slogan and is actually unreliable. The fourth crime of the Yugoslav Communists is that individual economy is widespread throughout the country. Since the Chinese Communists have accepted this decision, it can be seen that the Communist Party's claim to protect urban industry and commerce is a shameless deception. From this, it can be seen that the actual policy of the Communist International conflicts with the propaganda slogans used by the Chinese Communists. It is precisely using the spear of the son to attack the shield of the son. Its hypocrisy is very obvious. If the Chinese Communists' so-called patriotism and national united front are true, they should never have accepted the Communist International's condemnation of the Yugoslav Communists. Since they have accepted it, it can be seen that the slogans flaunted by the Chinese Communists are purely intentional deception and are absolutely not to be believed.</p>
<p>We should take this opportunity to truly recognize that this behavior of the Chinese Communists is a completely unreserved manifestation of the bandit party's international espionage, and it is also the most solid proof of the bandit party's endangering the country and harming the people. Since we have thoroughly recognized the nature and ambition of this international armed fifth column, then striving to prevent and defend against it is our greatest responsibility and must not be lightly abandoned. At this critical moment of survival as masters or slaves, there is absolutely no room for ambiguity, hesitation, or doubt for the people of the whole country.</p>
<p>Sun Yat-sen said: "Nationalism is the doctrine of the nation." He also said: "We, in view of the reasons for the survival of clans in ancient and modern times, want to save China and want the Chinese nation to exist forever, we must promote nationalism." The nation is created by natural forces. Human nature has a deep foundation. Our Chinese nation has been established in East Asia and has a long history and a historically unchanging spirit. It relies on the deep-rooted national righteousness in the hearts of the people and cannot be shaken by foreign violence and heresies. In the past hundred years, China has been bound by unequal treaties due to the decadence of the imperial system. In the past fifty years, the invasion and occupation of land by Japanese warlords has further stimulated the national sentiments of our compatriots and strengthened the national consciousness of our compatriots, leading to a movement to save the nation. Therefore, Sun Yat-sen and the patriotic people of the whole country advocated the National Revolution to fight for the freedom and equality of China. The righteousness trended and compatriots at home and abroad followed suit. President Chiang Kai-shek inherited Sun Yat-sen's legacy and led the Northern Expedition to unify the country and resolutely resisted the war against Japan, recovering the lost land of the past fifty years, such as canceling the unequal treaties of the past one hundred years. Every step is aimed at the freedom, equality, unification, and independence of China. The facts are obvious and should be known to all the people of the country.</p>
<p>After the victorious end of the War of Resistance against Japan, the National Government resolutely convened the National Assembly, formulated a democratic constitution, and established a democratically elected government, striving to move forward towards the goals of government of the people, by the people, and for the people. If there were no disturbances from the Communist bandits and the suppression of the rebellion, the election methods and constitutional scale would naturally be more perfect.</p>
<p>However, looking at the past actions of the Communist Party, they have always had the purpose of seeking private gain. The party knew early on that the national spirit of our compatriots was a force that could not be easily insulted, so it had to use various slogans to conceal the nature of its Communist International branch and fifth column. Therefore, during the Northern Expedition of our National Revolutionary Army, it superficially advocated overthrowing imperialism, but actually obstructed the Northern Expedition in every possible way, and then divided the camp of the National Revolution. After the establishment of the National Government and the unification of national power, the Chinese Communists even established independent governments in southern Jiangxi and northern Shaanxi, dividing the territory and establishing themselves as heroes. During the full-scale war of resistance, the Communist bandits claimed to participate in the war of resistance, but in reality, they used this to expand their military force and prepare their plans to resist the government. When the war of resistance ended, the Communist Party's goal was primarily to seize Japanese weapons and establish liberation areas separate from the government, while obstructing the National Assembly and opposing the democratic constitution in order to prevent the progress of constitutionalism. It can be seen that from the beginning of its founding to the present day, the Chinese Communist Party has never abandoned its ambition to overthrow the government and split the country. In fact, its methods have always been extremely authoritarian and dictatorial, and its so-called new democracy is completely contradictory and inconsistent. Its propaganda is even more deceptive, divisive, and lacking in faith and truth. Its so-called self-criticism and discipline are clearly tools for oppressing party members. Therefore, comparing each other, the Chinese Communist Party's disregard for the country and its ulterior motives have always been obvious and clear.</p>
<h3>The Government's Suppression of Bandits and Rebellion Is Not a Party Dispute, Nor Is It a Civil War; Those Who Abandon the Bandits and Return Will Be Accommodated and Supported</h3>
<p>Therefore, we feel deeply sorry for the good people who have been deceived by the Communist Party and have joined it, only to be strictly controlled and abandon their motherland. For this reason, we also advise the people of the whole country to fully recognize that the Communist Party is indeed an affiliated organization of the Communist International and is indeed the source of danger to the country and the people. They must be cautious and vigilant, and must not be tempted by their false words and heresies.</p>
<p>At this time when the international conspiracy of the bandit party is fully exposed, it is the day when the people who have mistakenly joined the Communist Party and still have conscience should urgently seek to extricate themselves and return. All compatriots who do not want to be slaves and are unwilling to be traitors are people that the country should cherish and the people should support. Regardless of whether they have fought against the National Army in the past or have been enemies with their villages, as long as they abandon the bandit party and resolutely return, the government will definitely accommodate and protect them, and under the constitution, work together to save and build the country.</p>
<p>The government also wants to clearly tell people from all walks of life in society that the suppression of bandits and rebellion is not a party dispute, nor is it a civil war. It is because the Chinese Communist Party is indeed affiliated with the Communist International, selling out national sovereignty, and destroying the rights of the people. The government and patriotic compatriots throughout the country cannot but work together to quell it in order to preserve the foundation of the country. The declaration issued by the communist parties of nine European countries last year clearly stated that their goal is to undermine the effectiveness of US aid to other countries. The Chinese Communist Party, of course, adopted the same policy. Therefore, just when the US Congress decided on the aid to China plan and US aid to China officials were about to come to China, the Chinese Communist Party instigated anti-American sentiment in various schools, claiming to advocate it, but in reality, it was purely a performance of the Communist Party's world policy in our country. Under the revelation of such obvious and experimental facts, we deeply hope that the people of the whole country can clearly distinguish between good and evil and work together towards the correct direction of saving and building the country.</p>

<h3>The President Climbs to a High Place for a Scenic View: He is Extremely Pleased with the Distant View of Taihu Lake and the Qiantang River; It Was Hot and Dry in the Mountains Yesterday; He Read Books at the Official Residence in the Afternoon</h3>
<p>[This newspaper, Moganshan, 28th] The President got up at 6 o'clock this morning, dressed in casual clothes for a walk, and inquired about the well-being of his neighbors. At about 9 o'clock, Wang Zhengyi, Director of the Administration Bureau, and Zhou Xiangxian, Mayor of Hangzhou, walked to Luhua Dang and waited for an audience there. Many people who came to admire his demeanor bowed and paid their respects. The President replied, "Good, good." He then went to the residence of Huang Yingbai at No. 509, and inquired about the housekeeper of Huang's wife for a long time. Before leaving, he ordered his entourage to give the housekeeper a reward of 3 million yuan. Then the President turned to the intersection of Yinshan Street and climbed to the highest peak of Mogan Mountain, Tashan. He said that he took a rattan sedan chair to the entrance of Tashan Park and walked uphill, leaving the sedan chair. At this time, the sun had not yet risen to the top of the mountain. The President looked out over Taihu Lake and the Qiantang River from the mountain, and looked quite pleased. After about fifteen minutes, he returned to the official residence along the original road. At noon, after a nap, the President read books in a rattan chair at the official residence and did not go out. After dinner, he enjoyed the evening scenery on the lawn in front of the door.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Moganshan, 28th] President Chiang and his wife are staying in the mountains for a short time. He is in good health and in a pleasant mood. He is very interested in the beautiful natural environment of Moganshan. At 9 a.m. on the 28th, the President, accompanied by Director of the Bureau and Mayor Xiangxian, visited Luhua Dang, another scenic spot in Mogan Mountain. The President was wearing a summer cloth long shirt and a cork hat, and walked slowly in the mountains with a cane. All was quiet, except for the sound of birds and cicadas, as if welcoming the head of state who was devoted to the country. On the way, he visited Jingyi Villa, the residence of the party and state elder Zhang Jingjiang, and rested for a while. Then he followed the mountain road to visit the former residence of his old friend Huang Yingbai. The President sat here for a while and boiled Luhua Dang spring water to cool off the heat. After a while, he left and went straight to Luhua Dang. A bay of streams was clear and could be used as a mirror. Tourists cheered when they saw the President's arrival. The President nodded frequently in response. At about 10 o'clock, he climbed to Tashan, the summit of Mogan Mountain. Tashan rises 2,500 feet above sea level and can overlook the Qiantang River to the east and Tianmu Mountain to the west. The President climbed to a high place and looked into the distance, taking in the beautiful rivers and mountains. He lingered for a long time before slowly descending the mountain with his cane. On the way back, he saw a policeman on the side of the road. The President stopped and asked the policeman where he was from and whether the salary he received was enough to keep him warm and fed. His concern was evident in his words. He returned to the official residence for rest at 11 o'clock. It was hot and dry in the mountains today. The President did not travel in the afternoon and read books in the official residence.</p>

<h3>Zhang Zhaoyuan Expresses His Thoughts on the Achievements of the First Session of the Legislative Yuan; The Loyalty and Devotion of All Committee Members Is Truly Admirable</h3>
<p>[This newspaper, Nanjing, 28th] Zhang Zhaoyuan, Secretary-General of the Legislative Yuan, recently made a statement on his thoughts on the first session of the Legislative Yuan. He said: "This first session of the Legislative Yuan under the constitution can be said to be the first chapter in the beginning of democratic politics. The scale of the achievements is beyond expectations. I can prove it with facts. From the opening of the meeting on May 8 to the adjournment on July 24, it lasted only two and a half months. A total of 61 cases have been concluded, including 9 legal cases, 3 financial cases, 3 budget cases, 2 treaty cases, 2 consent cases, and 2 other cases submitted by the government. A total of 12 legal cases and 18 other cases were submitted by various committee members. 10 cases concerned the Yuan itself. In addition, there are 95 cases still under review, including 38 legal cases, 1 financial case, and 3 treaty cases submitted by the government. 7 legal cases, 14 financial cases, and 32 other cases were submitted by various committee members. In this short period of time, the initial progress was slow due to the beginning of the meeting, the efficiency increased in the middle, and the progress in the final stage was in order after the organization of the Program Committee, which was no less than the parliament of any advanced country. In the meantime, there may be some twists and turns and wasting of time, but the British and American parliaments have today's results, which are the beautiful fruits of hundreds of years of painful experience. It is inevitable that the first session of our Legislative Yuan will be overly criticized if we expect it to be like the current state of the British and American parliaments. What is most admirable is that, no matter how much the 700-odd legislators debated, their loyalty and devotion to the country were exactly the same. During voting, they based their decisions on gains and losses and showed full rationality. During the session, they defied the heat and worked hard, reviewed budget bills and legal bills late into the night. After the adjournment, various committees continued to review the unfinished cases submitted by the Yuan with the committee members and conveners staying in Beijing, so that they could be submitted for discussion in the second session in a timely manner. This kind of request fully demonstrates that the committee members are able to live up to the trust of the people. Regarding the administrative aspects, I took office on May 18. The government had no material preparation, and I was unable to prepare before taking office. Therefore, office space, committee member housing, transportation, and expenses were all problems that were not easy to solve at the time. The colleagues of the Secretariat worked tirelessly day and night. Their spirit of trying to overcome difficulties is also worthy of recollection, and the committee members are mostly rich in administrative experience, and can understand some of the imperfect factors in the consultation, which makes me even more encouraged."</p>
<h3>Lu Establishes a People's Salvation Pioneer Team</h3>

<h3>Celebrating the Opening of the World Games</h3>
<p>At a time when all of humanity is trapped in the horror of war, the Fourteenth World Games solemnly opens in London today. This Olympic gathering, held in the revitalized capital of Britain, is grand in scale, with 61 participating countries and a total of 6,118 athletes. No other sporting event can compare to the solemnity and greatness of this one. The planned opening ceremony today will begin with a parade of delegations from each country, carrying their national flags and nameplates, to be reviewed by the British monarch. After the monarch declares the start of the Olympic Games, bugles will sound, cannons will fire, and relay runners carrying the torch will enter the Empire Stadium. The Olympic flag-raising ceremony will see the bright flag raised amidst the sound of bugles, and over a thousand silver pigeons will take flight, signaling to the world that the Olympic Games have begun. The Olympic Games are a symbol of peace, unity, democracy, and progress. The historical significance they bring is infinitely sacred, infinitely bright, and infinitely great. We sing hymns of praise, welcoming the opening of the World Games, and we pray that the atmosphere of Olympic harmony will spread and flourish.</p>
<p>The Olympic Games originated in ancient Greece and made a great contribution to maintaining the relations between Greek city-states and training the martial spirit of the Greeks. Its origins are difficult to verify. A more reliable explanation is that ancient Greece had four important festivals, one of which was called the Olympic Games, which was specially used to commemorate the god of the sky, the father of all gods and mankind. At that time, only those of pure Greek descent could participate in the games. After Greece was conquered by Rome, Romans also had the right to participate. In the first thirteen Olympic Games, the only competition event was racing. Later, it gradually increased to 24 events, including short and long-distance races, wrestling, boxing, chariot races, horse races, and armored races. The past Olympic Games had a strong atmosphere of peace. Every time the meeting was held, a large number of silver pigeons would be released to fly to the warring city-states to announce the opening of the meeting and call on the belligerents to immediately cease fighting. This kind of religious and divine influence once took effect in a very short process. Over time, the authority of the warring parties did not accept its influence. In 490 BC, during the Battle of Marathon, the Athenian army fought on the front line. The warrior Phidippides returned south to report the victory and later became a famous "Marathon" in sports, which symbolized the disappearance of the meaning of peace. Therefore, it is said that the peace meaning of the Olympics is only symbolic and unattainable.</p>
<p>At the same time, the ancient Greek Olympic Games were also a comprehensive expression of religion, art, politics, and social movements. The "sportsmanship" cultivated on the sports field gradually penetrated the blood of Greek culture. As a result, the Aegean Sea, the cradle of ancient civilization, was filled with self-confidence, vigor, democracy, and the glory of progress. This glory has brought infinite happiness to later generations. Unfortunately, the Olympic Games, which began in 776 BC, were forcibly stopped by Roman Emperor Theodosius I in 394 AD after being held for 293 sessions. This was the dark age of mankind. It was not until April 6, 1896, that the first World Games after Easter was announced in Athens. Mankind once again embarked on the road of peace and unity. Since then, it has been held every four or two years, convened in different countries. The sixth World Games should have been held in 1916, but unfortunately it was stopped due to World War I. The seventh session was held in Antwerp in 1920. The most noteworthy thing is the eleventh session held in Berlin in 1936, which was also the last session before this (fourteenth) session, and formally restored the "Olympic Flame", burning brightly. The twelfth session was originally scheduled to be held in Tokyo in 1940, but because Japan launched the war of aggression against China, and then in 1939, fires spread all over Europe, and the twelfth World Games was stopped. The Second World War was in progress in 1944, so the thirteenth World Games was also announced to be postponed.</p>
<p>Now, three years after the end of the war, people are welcoming the Fourteenth World Games with joy. In today's world, despite the "Cold War" of great power politics manifested in every corner of the world, and the Chinese and Greek people are even more trapped in dire straits, mankind is always moving in the direction of progress, calling for peace, demanding stability, fighting for democracy, and heading for freedom. An Olympic Games, a symbol of peace, may be valued by the people of the world today because it values its sacred meaning, brightness and greatness, peace and stability. We Chinese people are living in an era of suffering today; our reason demands brightness, we wish the "Olympic Flame" to burn and radiate brilliance, bringing happiness to those who suffer; we wish to see silver pigeons flying over our vast land, bringing good news. We also wish that from now on, the torch of light will drive away the demons of killing; our Yangtze River and Yellow River, our Black Water and White Water, will be covered with bright flowers and happy fruits.</p>
<p>We welcome the arrival of the World Games, we cheer and sing: Peace! Freedom! Democracy! Progress! We congratulate the athletes of the Chinese delegation for their happiness and health. Today we will raise the great flag of the Republic of China, the Blue Sky, White Sun, and Red Earth, parading before all countries, all races, and all peoples, gaining cheers and sympathy. We do not necessarily need to compete for championships, we only need justice and righteousness, civilization and glory! We celebrate the opening of the Fourteenth Olympic Games in solemn splendor, and we celebrate the arrival of the modern era. We cheer! We sing!</p>

<h3>Leibhahn's Remarks in Beiping; US Aid Not Biased; Leibhahn Scheduled to Fly to Taiyuan for Inspection</h3>
<p>[Our Beiping Dispatch, 28th] Leibhahn visited Li Zongren at 10:30 AM on the 28th and discussed for one hour. After the meeting, Li told reporters: "I exchanged views on the use of US aid. I told him to pay attention to the urgent need for US aid in the North and not to be biased towards the North. Leibhahn fully agreed with my opinion."</p>
<p>[Local News] China Airlines will send a passenger plane early tomorrow (29th) morning to carry Leibhahn and his party, who are the executors of US aid, from Ping to Taiyuan for inspection.

<p>[Central News Agency, Beiping, 28th] Leibhahn stated again at a press conference in Ping on the 28th that US aid is not biased and that they have never ignored the importance of the North in military and economic aspects. After explaining the preliminary plan for the distribution of US aid, Leibhahn continued: The core of the US aid problem is how to properly allocate and rationally use it. The final report of the Steelman Investigation Team is expected to be drafted next month for Director Hoffman to make the final decision. He also said: The allocation of US aid is difficult, so the temporarily formulated principles will inevitably have more or less revisions during implementation. After Leibhahn finished speaking, he also answered reporters' questions, saying: (1) The use of US aid will never be concentrated in one place, and the Steelman report cannot be regarded as an immutable decision. (2) Aid to Europe and aid to China are equally important militarily. World peace is indivisible. Americans have a deeper understanding of Europe due to travel or historical relationships, but they have not ignored the East. (3) The Chinese government is in a difficult situation and may not be satisfactory in some respects, but the Agency will cooperate with it to revive China. (4) China is an old country with a long history and culture. It will take many changes to achieve the ideal of reform. Therefore, we should not expect to see any progress by April 3 next year. Leibhahn also said: He was very impressed after inspecting Tianjin.</p>

The few remaining parts also urgently need repair and replacement. The million tons of iron ore that I intend to sell to Japan will be produced in Daye and Ma'anshan. It is understood that the sales method may be retail or a single contract for bulk sales, which has not yet been determined. However, the price will be determined with reference to the iron price in the Great Lakes region of the United States. As for the quantity of steel manufacturing machinery that Japan can use to exchange with me, it still needs to be calculated. Furthermore, Allied Headquarters reported that a Shanghai company signed a contract with Japan on July 17 to export 200,000 tons of iron ore to Japan, which is expected to start arriving in Japan after September 25. The contract also stipulates that the company will be fined if there are delays in delivery.</p>

<h3>U.S., British, and French Ambassadors to Meet with Molotov Today, Presenting a Joint New Note, Hoping to Facilitate Four-Power Negotiations on the German Question</h3>
<p>[United Press, London, 28th] U.S. Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Smith, has departed for Moscow by special plane this evening and is expected to arrive in Moscow on the 29th. Smith's special plane stopped briefly in Berlin at midnight.</p>
<p>Another dispatch: Roberts, the private secretary to British Foreign Secretary Bevin, left London on the 28th for Moscow, together with representatives from the U.S. and France, to deliver the Western response to the Kremlin. Roberts, who was originally the British Minister to the Soviet Union, will fly to Berlin on the same plane as General Robertson, the British military commander in Germany, and then fly to Moscow with U.S. Ambassador to the Soviet Union, General Smith.</p>
<p>[United Press, London, 28th] According to authoritative sources, the U.S., French, and British ambassadors to the Soviet Union will inform Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov in Moscow on the 29th of the decision made at the London Conference regarding relations with the Soviet Union. They will place the biggest bet since the end of the war, which could be for peace or war, but not necessarily immediate peace or immediate war. However, they also said that this new negotiation with the Soviet Union and the Soviet Union's response could be a turning point for the situation to improve or worsen. This oral note was handled with extreme caution and long preparation beforehand. The various departments of the U.S. government have never paid so much attention to diplomatic action before. It is generally expected that the U.S., British, and French ambassadors will frankly tell Molotov that their governments are prepared to begin negotiations with the Soviet Union on the German question as soon as the Berlin blockade is lifted. This negotiation does not mean that a four-power foreign ministers' conference will be convened immediately, as the preparatory work for a four-power foreign ministers' conference will take a long time. It is generally expected that the Western powers will first suggest negotiations through normal diplomatic channels and the Allied Control Council for Germany.</p>
<p>[United Press, London, 28th] Authoritative sources said that Smith will make oral representations to Molotov on behalf of the U.S., Britain, and France, pointing out that the Berlin blockade violates Article 2 of the United Nations Charter, which states that "Members of the United Nations shall settle their international disputes by peaceful means in such a manner that international peace and security, and justice, are not endangered." This is the decision reached at the London Conference of the U.S., Britain, and France. There is no doubt that the Western powers have reached an agreement and may finally agree to convene a four-power conference or refer the Berlin issue to the United Nations, but at this stage, the Western powers have agreed to delay any action that could lead to the reopening of the four-power foreign ministers' conference or an appeal to the United Nations.</p>
<p>[This newspaper] Geneva, 28th broadcast: Washington dispatch: Marshall told reporters that the United States has reached an agreement with Britain and France on the Berlin issue but refused to disclose the contents of this agreement. At the same time, he was unwilling to confirm or deny whether the three governments had instructed their ambassadors to the Soviet Union to discuss the Berlin situation directly with Molotov.</p>
<h3>Republicans Attempt to Attack Truman, Decide to Adopt Delaying Tactics, Plan to Request Congress to Adjourn, Making the Plan Fail</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 27th] The special session of the U.S. Congress convened by President Truman to establish anti-inflation legislation was attacked by Truman on the 27th, as Republican leaders accused Truman's plan of having political purposes and launched an offensive to quickly adjourn the meeting. In fact, they will make Truman's hopes for all his demands to vanish. After discussing Truman's plan by telephone with the Republican presidential candidate Dewey, the Republican leaders agreed to consider Truman's plan. But they made it clear that they did not intend to turn any of these plans into legislation and said that they planned to stop the meeting and return home in two weeks.</p>
<p>In addition, they will put the anti-poll tax bill passed by the House of Representatives on the first item of discussion on the Senate agenda, thus setting up a huge obstacle in the way of any action. At the same time, Democratic Senator Johnston (South Carolina) has prepared to propose an adjournment, and he is the leader of the Democratic rebellious senators in the eleven southern states who oppose Truman's demands for racial rights. After the Republican leaders held a strategy meeting, they replied with a policy declaration of more than a thousand words, denouncing the president's convening of the special conference as a political means to seek re-election as president. They accused the Democratic government of being responsible for the current high prices and stated that they were willing to hand over the matter to the people of the whole country to decide in the November election. Truman had previously told the hostile Congress that Congress must stop inflation, otherwise, it would bear the brunt of the unpopular tragedy. He demanded the rapid passage of the collection of excessive profit tax, the restriction of wages and prices, the power to assign the distribution system, and other measures to "stop the rising prices." He also demanded that action be taken on the construction of housing programs now and not next year, and listed other major domestic issues.</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 27th] The words of Taft, chairman of the Senate Joint Party Policy Committee, can represent the Republican response. He said, "Considering the president's entire plan will take six months," and "these three points only emphasize the following facts, that is, the convening of the special parliament obviously has a political purpose."</p>
<p>Truman's Proposal, Unions Express Approval</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 27th] Unions today expressed their approval of President Truman's message to Congress. Spokespersons for the Industrial Confederation and the Labor Federation said that the president's proposal included most of the laws supported by their 1,300 members. However, they were not very enthusiastic about the wage control proposal. The Industrial Confederation made it clear that they opposed such control, claiming that careful study of inflation proved that wages were not the cause. Union spokespersons unanimously believed that the special meeting would allow voters to judge the performance of members in the November election.</p>
<h3>U.S. Army Still Insists on Segregation of Black and White People, President's Order is Difficult to Implement</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 28th] The U.S. Army still insisted on its original position on the segregation of black and white people on the 28th. Staff officials said that although the president ordered the prohibition of racial or other "discrimination," the Army believed that the implementation of this order did not require the implementation of a non-segregation system, because the president did not prohibit the segregation system. It also stated that all actions of the Army were awaiting the recommendations of the President's Committee. It also stated that Secretary of Defense Forrest will make a plan for the three armies to abide by in unity based on the above suggestions. Regarding this matter, Army Secretary Royal said simply and directly, "No comment." Army Chief of Staff Bradley said, "The Army does not advocate any social reforms. The Army will still separate people of different races. When the country changes this system, we will also change it."</p>

<h3>Yugoslav Leaders Express Willingness to Cooperate Economically with the United States, the Albanian-Bulgarian-Yugoslavian Alliance Plan is Not Abandoned</h3>
<p>[United States News Agency, Belgrade, 27th] The first Deputy Prime Minister of Yugoslavia, Kardelj, told the Communist Party Congress here on Monday that Yugoslavia advocates economic cooperation with all countries in the world on an equal footing. Before Kardelj made this statement, Yugoslav Prime Minister Tito himself also expressed a similar opinion when he met with former California Governor Olson (Wallace faction), who is currently touring Europe. It is said that Tito told Olson that Yugoslavia is willing to start trade relations with the United States but is unwilling to make any political concessions for this goal.</p>
<p>Tito also said that he intends to respond to the Communist International Information Bureau with facts to prove that the Communist Party he leads has not made a mistake.</p>
<p>[French News Agency, Belgrade, 28th] The Yugoslav Communist Party Congress unanimously passed the political program on forming a federation with Albania and Bulgaria. This political program does not immediately seek its realization because politicians from Albania and Bulgaria recently issued statements denouncing the matter. The political program also advocates closer cooperation with other democratic countries.</p>
<p>Support Greek Guerrillas</p>
<p>[French News Agency, Belgrade, 28th] The Director of the News Agency of the Yugoslav Prime Minister's Office told the Yugoslav Communist Party Congress this morning that "we reiterate that the Yugoslav Communist Party Congress will support Greece in fighting for independence and for the security of all democratic countries."

<p>Maintain Friendship with the Soviet Union</p>
<p>[French News Agency, Belgrade, 27th] Yugoslav Deputy Foreign Minister Biberle declared at the Communist Party Congress today that the treaty of friendship between Yugoslavia and the Soviet Union is still the basis of Yugoslavia's foreign policy. He also said that Yugoslavia is often oppressed by imperialist countries in international conferences, which is not in line with people's democracy. Yugoslavia is the country most hated by capitalist countries after the Soviet Union. Yugoslavia is the last country among the people's democratic countries to recover its gold stored in the United States and has even suffered a huge discount. Yugoslavia applied for a loan from the International Bank last December but failed to obtain it, but other people's democratic countries obtained loans for their mutual trade. Yugoslavia's foreign policy will not be changed merely because of the misunderstandings of the Communist Information Bureau. We will never betray the Soviet Union and other people's democratic countries. Marshal Tito of Yugoslavia cannot be moved by the gold of the world.</p>

<h3>Dewey's Brain Trust</h3>
<p>— Translated by Zhang Yunshi —</p>
<p>The other figures may not be well known throughout the United States, but they have hopes of forming a cabinet with Dewey. The expected situation is as follows:</p>
<p>Lockwood, one of Dewey's brain trusts, is 46 years old this year. He is Dewey's administrative advisor and may be appointed as the chief secretary of the White House if the Republican Party is elected. He has the power to decide who can and cannot see Dewey. Lockwood is a burly and amiable figure who used to practice law. He joined the Dewey brain trust in 1935 when he prosecuted New York gangsters.</p>
<p>Hedge, a former reporter for "The New York Times," is 39 years old. Unlike O'Reilly under the Roosevelt administration and Ross under the Truman administration, he has no experience as a Washington reporter. He has a good relationship with Dewey.</p>
<p>Burton, 40, is the current budget director of Governor Dewey. He may be appointed as the director of the US Budget Bureau when Dewey is president. Chapman, 44 this year, first took office as the New York Tax Commissioner in 1946. He is one of Dewey's financial advisors. Strauss, 59 this year, is a planning expert and may naturally be assigned a corresponding task.</p>
<p>The above are the internal figures of Dewey. For the remaining departments, he needs to find people from the Republican family.</p>
<p>The position of Secretary of Defense may be held by Senator Martin from Pennsylvania, 68 years old. The next most promising candidate is Senator Cain from Washington.</p>
<p>The position of Secretary of Agriculture may be held by Hopper, 55 years old this year, from Kansas, currently chairman of the Agricultural Committee. The next most promising candidate is Mayo. He is the president of Cornell University and formerly served as the administrator of the agricultural trust loan organization. Ferguson, a senator from Michigan, may be the Attorney General.</p>
<p>Winnemas, 47 years old this year, is a senator from Oregon. He may be appointed as the Secretary of the Interior after Dewey is elected. Milligan, 57 years old this year, is a senator from Carolina. Although he supported Taft before the Philadelphia Convention, he also has hopes of being appointed as the Secretary of the Interior or other important positions. However, his hope of remaining in the Senate is also very high.</p>
<p>Stetson, 41 years old this year, failed in the presidential candidate election, but his call to join the Dewey administration is also very high.</p>
<p>Hoffman is 57 years old this year. He used to run an automobile business and is currently the director of the European Aid Administration. He may be appointed as the Secretary of Commerce after Dewey becomes president, but he may also remain as the director of the European Aid Administration if he is willing to do so.</p>
<p>Milton Eisenhower, 49 years old this year, is the brother of Marshal Eisenhower and the current president of Kansas State College. He may be appointed as the Secretary of Education or the Secretary of Health.</p>
<p>After Dewey is elected president, the main figures in the White House may also become a completely New York-dominated administration. Now, regardless of the situation after Dewey takes office, in short, if Dewey is elected as the next president, under the circumstances of new people and new policies, he may do a good job.

<h3>Executive Yuan Supports Shanghai's Finances, One-Time Subsidy of 1.4 Trillion, Budget Review Committee Report Believes It Should Not Rely on the Central Government</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch from Nanjing, 28th] Regarding Shanghai's financial difficulties and the proposal to request subsidies from the central government, after repeated trips by Tian Yong, Director of the Shanghai Municipal Finance Bureau, the case was submitted for discussion at the Executive Yuan meeting on the 28th and it was resolved to grant a one-time subsidy of 1.4 trillion yuan. It has been learned that the Shanghai Municipal Government's telegram will include an additional half-month's living allowance for civil servants and teachers for June, which must be settled according to the index for that month, and the living allowance to be paid this month has reached 1.4 trillion yuan, and the index settlement will be at least 600 billion yuan or more. In addition, other temporary expenses for office, economic construction, and health, based on low estimates, require about 400 billion yuan, totaling 2.4 trillion yuan. On the income side, there is only about 1 trillion yuan, so the shortfall for this month alone will reach 1.4 trillion yuan. In addition to requesting approval for subsidies for the monthly revenue and expenditure shortfalls in the second half of this year, it is also requested that the 1.4 trillion yuan shortfall for July be allocated first by emergency order before the 20th of this month, and then supplemented later. After receiving the telegram, the Executive Yuan handed it over to the Budget Review Committee for review, and on the 28th, discussed it based on the review opinions. According to the review report, "Shanghai's industry and commerce are prosperous, and the tax base is relatively wealthy. It should increase revenue through various means and should not rely on central government subsidies. This time, the city government increased the living allowance for employees by half a month in June, and temporary expenditures increased sharply. Tax collection could not adapt, and prices continued to rise, and the difference between revenue and expenditure became even greater. What has been stated is indeed the actual situation. It is proposed to approve a one-time discretionary subsidy for some temporary expenses for economic construction and health, and submit it to the Executive Yuan meeting for decision." After discussion at the Executive Yuan meeting on the 28th, it was decided to grant a one-time subsidy of 1.4 trillion yuan based on this report. In addition, Director Tian of the Shanghai Field Bureau returned to Shanghai by overnight train on the 28th.</p>

<h3>Speaker Discusses the Problem of the Garrison Brigade, Hoping Commander Xuan Will Dismiss the Idea of Resigning</h3>
<p>Regarding the problem that the city's garrison brigade has not yet been established, this reporter visited Speaker Pan Gongzhan yesterday to solicit his opinion. He replied: The force to maintain public security in the city needs to be strengthened urgently. The local self-defense force should be quickly organized by the competent authorities in accordance with the law, and should especially refer to the method implemented by Commander-in-Chief Bai Jian Gong in Hankou of giving short-term universal military training to able-bodied young men of age, and plan to implement it. As for the establishment of the garrison brigade, the Municipal Council has already made a resolution, and hopes that it will be carried out in conjunction with the city's second phase of conscription this year, so that the patriotic youth of Taishi of age have the opportunity to serve in the military in accordance with the law, with guns never leaving people and people never leaving their hometowns, and everyone fulfilling their responsibility to defend their hometown. The fundraising of funds should first focus on the fair burden of the wealthier households. However, this matter is of great importance, and it is hoped that Mayor Wu and Commander Xuan will consult on concrete measures as soon as possible and actively carry out the plan. It is heard that Commander Xuan is currently in poor health and has firmly resigned, and the central government has retained him, so it is hoped that he will dismiss the idea of resigning as soon as possible, take responsibility for training, maintain public security, so that villains have no way to succeed, and industry and commerce can enjoy their work.</p>

Because water was being pumped out on one side, and river water was still entering continuously on the other side, it was impossible to pump it all out. Yesterday, the company prepared to remove the paper in the hold, continue pumping water, and hire divers to repair the leak, and then enter the dock for repairs.

According to Yang, the urban rationing plan will continue unchanged in the future, but since US aid grain is only enough to meet 40 percent of the needs, how to purchase and supply the remaining 60 percent requires a specialized agency to plan it so that rationing can proceed smoothly. The new institution is planned to be established in Shanghai to closely connect with the US Economic Cooperation Administration.

<p>In total, the survey results of the city's 30 districts show that, except for the number of poor in Gaoqiao, Sisheng, and Jing'an districts that have not yet been submitted, the preliminary statistics for the remaining 27 districts show that there are a total of 886,795 poor people, accounting for about 37 percent of the city's total population. After the survey is completed, the list will be published in each jia. If citizens have any opinions on the list, they can appeal to the district office. After a review and reorganization, a rationing certificate will be issued. In the future, the survey will be conducted once a month based on the results of this survey to ensure accuracy and precision. However, the matter of rationing rice to the poor is a difficult task, and the city has a vast area and a dense population, and there may be shortcomings. It is hoped that everyone present will give their guidance."</p>

<h3>Land Administration Bureau Planning to Levy Vacant Land Tax, to Promote Land Use, to Achieve the Goal of Relieving the Housing Shortage</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] The city's population has recently increased sharply, forming an unprecedentedly serious housing shortage. However, in fact, there are still many vacant lots in the city that have not been used, and are still allowed to be abandoned. Relevant parties are paying close attention to this issue. According to news from the Land Administration Bureau, the bureau is currently planning to levy a vacant land tax in accordance with the resolution of the sixth general meeting of the Municipal Council, and has already drafted a plan. As soon as it is submitted to the municipal government for approval, it can be officially implemented. It is heard that this method is based on the provisions of Article 173 of the Land Law, designating areas and setting a time limit for building houses. If the houses are not built after the time limit, a vacant land tax will be levied, and the tax rate will be three times and ten times the land value tax to be paid. The levy of land value tax is based on the value of the land itself. The vacant land tax is levied on top of the land value tax. The intention of increasing the tax burden on vacant land without any income is to promote the use of land through taxation. It is not uncommon to see cases where major cities in the world have adopted this measure and achieved results.</p>

<h3>University Student Refuses to Marry, Fiancée Denies Writing Letter of Repentance, Taken to Police Station Then to Court, Interrogated and Accused of Adultery</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Report] On June 26 of this year, Peng Zhixing, a native of Huangyan, Zhejiang, and his daughter Peng Chujiao went to the police station to accuse Feng Ji, a student at Great China University, claiming that from November of last year to January 25 of this year, his daughter Peng was raped three times by her fiancé Feng Ji in the Zhongnan, Da Hu, and Da Shanghai hotels. Unexpectedly, after becoming pregnant for five months, Feng Ji refused to marry her and avoided meeting her. They requested that the police station arrest him. Feng was subsequently arrested by the police station at the Dada Wharf. According to Feng's confession: His marriage to Peng Chujiao was arranged by his uncle Wang Mengxia and Zhang Yuhua as matchmakers, and decided by his parents. The engagement took place in his hometown on the sixth day of the fourth lunar month last year. At the time, he was studying in Shanghai and did not know about it beforehand. Later, Peng came to Shanghai to study at the Southeast Medical College. Because she was unfamiliar with the place, he often accompanied her to go out shopping and watch movies. In November of last year, after watching a movie with Peng, it was too late, so they opened a room at the Zhongnan Restaurant and stayed overnight, and thus the relationship occurred. At the time, he discovered that Peng Chujiao was not a virgin, but Peng refused to reveal the truth. Later, in December of last year and January 25 of this year, they secretly met at the Da Hu and Da Shanghai hotels respectively. Through honeyed words, he finally learned that Peng had already had a relationship with Zhu Yao and Zheng Deyi before the engagement. At the time, in order to express her remorse, she personally wrote a letter of repentance and handed it to him. However, he believed that Peng had lost her virginity twice, making it difficult for her to become a lifelong partner, so he refused to marry her. At the same time, he presented the letter of repentance, the original text of which is as follows: "Peng Chujiao is 21 years old this year, a native of Huangyan, Zhejiang. At the age of 16, she studied at the Linhai Private Jiancheng Middle School and had an affair with Zhu Yaojun. At that time, due to emotional impulses, her virginity was broken by Mr. Zhu. At the age of 17, she transferred to the Huangyan County Middle School and met her sister's husband, Mr. Zheng Deyi, and was seduced and had a relationship once. These two events are the greatest shame of my life. But from now on, I will never go down this wrong path again. If similar things happen in the future, then Feng Ji can punish me in any way he wants, and I will never go back on my word. This is my word. Repenter: Peng Chujiao, April 21." Peng resolutely denied writing the letter of repentance. The police station then transferred the case to the District Procuratorate. After interrogation, Feng Ji was formally prosecuted for having sexual relations with a girl under the age of 20 (Peng Chujiao was born on the sixth day of the sixth lunar month, and was not yet 20 years old when the relationship with Feng Ji occurred). The trial will be held in the District Court soon.</p>

<h3>Dispute in Sanjiang Township, Xinhui, Support Association Reports the Truth</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Report] Compatriots from the Zheng and Zhao clans of Sanjiang Township, Xinhui County, Guangdong, in Shanghai, claimed that their Qianhengsha Hall was attacked by Longquan Township in the same county, and four villagers were shot and killed. They organized a support association and invited the press in this city yesterday afternoon to report the facts as follows: It is claimed that the ownership of the Shangxia Sha farmland belongs to Sanjiang, which has been a fact for hundreds of years. Sanjiang has repeatedly built bunkers to prevent bandits, but they have all been destroyed by Longquan. This time, the four villagers of Sanjiang Township were killed entirely due to being attacked. Longquan Township then used water mines to blockade the waterways in and out of Sanjiang, and armed checkpoints were set up on land routes, and rice crops were seized, resulting in the complete isolation of Sanjiang's food sources and transportation. The villagers of Sanjiang, for self-defense, organized self-defense teams, but were falsely accused of being "bandit followers." At the beginning of constitutional governance, Longquan used dark forces to arbitrarily kill people, which is a disregard for the law. In order to defend justice, the association will publish the true facts in the hope of gaining sympathy and support from the press and the public.</p>

<h3>Sun Pusheng Incident in Jiangyin, Trial Set for the 31st, Witnesses Huang Enrong and Others to Be Interrogated, County Magistrate and Township Head Express Their Opinions, All Advocate Awaiting Judicial Handling</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Jiangyin 28th Report] Regarding the incident of township head Niu Yusheng killing Xia Li native Sun Pusheng, Sun Guanyin, the father of the deceased, has filed a complaint with the local court. The local procuratorate has scheduled to summon both plaintiffs and defendants Sun Guanyin, Niu Yusheng, and Chen Xingbao, as well as witnesses Huang Enrong, Huang Qichang, Sun Xiaochen (i.e., Yao Cheng), and Sun Fusheng for interrogation on the 31st. This reporter interviewed Magistrate Xu on the 27th. According to him: The county government has ordered Wu Zongyuan, the director of Tang Township, to thoroughly investigate its main issue, whether Sun Pusheng was colluding with bandits or was suspected of it. It will be clear after the report is returned. The reporter asked whether, given the recent bandits in Sun's area, the township head had the right to kill him, and whether there was room for research between killing and intentionally killing. Magistrate Xu replied that since the case had been filed with the judiciary, it should be handled legally, and so on. The conference of all the township heads of the county was held on the same day, and Niu Yusheng also attended. After the reporter met with Township Head Niu, he inquired about the true process of the case. Niu said that before the case was clarified, he was not convenient to express any opinions, but the township office based on the requests submitted by the township residents of this township, such as Du Sheng, Fu Sheng, etc., and the reports from Sun Xida and his wife Lu and Sun Wang, that on July 4, Sun Pusheng brought a gun home, people were uneasy, and Sun Lu, etc., were afraid and wanted to beat her husband Sun Xida. There are official documents to prove this, and third parties in the local area can also come out and testify publicly. The reporter asked that if Sun escaped, had he fired five consecutive shots? Niu replied that there was no fact of firing five shots. In short, since the case is being handled by the judiciary, it will be able to find out the truth. The progress of this case will be reported later.</p>

<h3>Policeman Cai Hongsheng Donates Reward Money to Children's Orphanage</h3>
<p>Lawyer Jiang Huaisu writes to disclose and commend this action</p>
<p>Dear Editor: I was recently informed by Mr. Cai Hongsheng, formerly a repairman for the city's Defense Corps and currently a policeman at Lin Garden on Hongqiao Road, that at around 3:00 AM on the 23rd of this month, he suddenly heard cries for help from Minglu Garden on Dantian Road, his neighbor. He immediately went to assist with auxiliary policeman Ye Xiao, and saw that Minglu policeman Chen Wanli had been injured in the head by a thief with an iron tiger clamp. Because of his brave assistance, he captured the thief, Huang Guicai, on the spot, and turned him over to the Jihua Branch Bureau for questioning. Afterwards, he received a reward of 20 million yuan from Mr. Zheng Zhangfei, the owner of Mingdui Garden. However, Mr. Cai believes that serving the local community and maintaining security for decades is his duty, and that courageous action and mutual assistance in times of emergency are the spirit that all police officers should have. He feels that accepting Mr. Zheng's reward would be inappropriate and shameful, so he asks to donate it for charitable purposes, in the spirit of helping those in need. I have also heard that the children's orphanage run by Mr. Zhou Zuwang in Caohejing has been teaching and nurturing children well with remarkable results. Mr. Cai, due to his duties, does not have the time to do so himself and has asked me to pass this on for him. Therefore, I am sending Mr. Cai Hongsheng's reward of 20 million yuan to your newspaper to be received and transferred, and I hope that you will disclose the process to commend this action, so as to encourage and inspire others. Sincerely, Jiang Huaisu, July 26th.</p>

<h3>Import Control Committee to Host Press Conference Today to Announce New Policy on Self-Provided Foreign Exchange; Detailed Implementing Rules Have Been Drafted and Will Be Submitted to the Executive Yuan for Approval Today</h3>
<p>To increase production and enrich materials, the government authorities have opened up self-provided foreign exchange, so that nationals' funds abroad and overseas Chinese can invest in domestic production businesses such as industry, mining, agriculture, forestry, fisheries, water conservancy, and public transportation. The Import Control Committee (輸管會) has drafted the "Measures for Applying for the Import of Investments in Domestic Production Businesses by Overseas Chinese Capital and Nationals' Funds Abroad," which has been approved by the Executive Yuan. Huo Baoshu, the chairman of the Import Control Committee, is scheduled to hold a press conference at 4:00 PM today on the fourth floor of the Bank of China Building to announce this new policy and implement it. It is said that the committee is currently drafting detailed implementing rules for the new measures. Yesterday, Chairman Huo was busy discussing various technical issues with relevant parties, so that they could be released at the press conference today.</p>
<p>Another report: To accelerate the implementation of these measures, the Import Control Committee has appointed Huang Qinghua, Director of the Non-Quota Examination Department; Shen Zouting, Director of the Quota Allocation Department; Chen Junren, Director of the Promotion Department; and Fang Yuanxian, Director of the Secretariat, to form a small committee responsible for designing detailed implementing rules. It is reported that the detailed rules have been drafted and will be submitted to the Executive Yuan for approval today. It is said that the detailed implementing rules specify the types of materials that can be imported. It is reported that in addition to the production equipment in Appendix (1), the industrial raw materials in Appendix (2) and the parts in Appendix (3) can also be applied for import. However, the Import Control Committee will still closely monitor the use of imported materials. As for the handling of overseas Chinese capital imports, another small committee will be set up to be responsible. (The articles on the measures for applying for the import of investments in domestic production businesses by overseas Chinese capital and nationals' funds abroad can be found on the second page.)</p>
<h3>Strong Demand for Rice Drives Prices Up; Flour, Grain, Oilcakes Also Rise in Unison</h3>
<p>The rice market rose again. The market close on the previous day had already shifted to a firm trend, so the opening yesterday morning was also strong. Rice shops had very good demand, because credit was loose and sales were active. White japonica rice and thin japonica rice in the northern market were both 37 million yuan, while some high-quality japonica rice was priced at 40 million yuan. New japonica rice from Pudong continued to be offered in the southern market, priced at 38 million yuan. Brown rice mills also had good demand, with prices rising by 2.5 million yuan each. However, the market softened slightly at the close because demand had been met. Yesterday's arrivals were 4,485 piculs.</p>
<p>Flour continued to rise, due to loose credit, rising rice prices, and expectations of higher prices. Retailers absorbed supplies and actual sales were also strong. Old Che flour opened at 11.8 million yuan, once reaching 12 million yuan, but closed slightly lower at 11.5 million yuan, a rise of 500,000 yuan. Bingship Flour rose by 700,000 yuan to 10.7 million yuan. Hongfeng and Jiancheng were both at 10.5 million yuan. Unhulled wheat rose by 450,000 yuan. Large bags of bran were 8.25 million yuan.</p>
<p>Miscellaneous grains rose in unison. With the easing of credit, demand from customers strengthened, and vendors were even more insistent on raising prices. Soybeans rose by 1 million yuan. Corn, broad beans, and northern sales were sluggish, with only a slight increase of 500,000 yuan. Barley rose by 1 million yuan. Broad beans increased by 500,000 yuan. Red sorghum rose by 1 million yuan. Sesame seeds rose by 2 million yuan. Shelled peanuts had strong demand from Guangdong merchants, rising by 4 million yuan.</p>
<p>Cooking Oil</p>
<p>Continued to rise. With the loosening of credit, all commodities rose, and expectations were strong. Vendors held firm. However, soybean oil rose only slightly yesterday because it had already risen on the previous day. Factory soybean oil opened at 74 million yuan and closed at 73 million yuan, a slight increase of 1 million yuan. The same was true for raw rapeseed oil. Raw oil rose by 5 million yuan. Jiton raw oil was 95 million yuan. Sesame oil from small mills rose the most, increasing by 8 million yuan. Soybean cakes continued to rise, increasing by 400,000 to 500,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>Flat Water Tea Exports Sluggish</h3>
<p>Flat water green tea has always been sold mostly to America, but in recent years, since Japanese tea has been selling cheaply and extensively, the demand for this tea is not as urgent as before. Furthermore, the price offered is always an attempt to suppress prices. As such, it seems that Chinese tea in America has gradually lost its importance. At present, the only outlet for Chinese tea is the Mediterranean coast of Europe, but recently the price offered is also very harsh. Exporters in the city have repeatedly telegraphed to request a price increase, but they have not been able to get it. As a result, the tea market for foreign merchants has been greatly diminished. Any trades that have been made are only for waiting for shipment. As for the trend, the sellers are holding firm and not discouraged, and the future looks like it will rise. As for domestic tea, the market continues steadily with very few changes.</p>

<h3>Alkali Industry Prospects Optimistic; Taiwan Province Prepares to Increase Production</h3>
<p>The prospects for the alkali industry in our country are extremely optimistic. According to surveys, the total amount of caustic soda required by various industries is more than 7,800 tons per quarter.

After 10:30, the market atmosphere became even more brisk, and bids to buy at 50 million yuan were made, but no transactions were made.

<h3>14th World Olympic Games to Open in London Today with 61 Nations and Over 6,000 Athletes Participating in 17 Sports, Displaying an Unprecedented Spectacle</h3>
<p>[Our Report] The 14th Olympic World Games, the first World Games after the war, will hold a grand opening ceremony at 4:00 PM today (July 29th) at the Wembley Empire Stadium in London. King George VI of England will personally attend to declare the opening of the 14th World Games. A total of 61 countries are participating in this session, with more than 6,100 athletes competing in 17 sports. The spectacle will set a new record never seen before in World Games history. The official competition will begin tomorrow and end on August 14th, lasting a total of two weeks, with Sundays as rest days. Unfortunately, three countries with outstanding athletes were unable to participate this session. The Soviet Union did not accept the invitation, while Germany and Japan were not qualified to participate. Since the Berlin World Games, more than ten years have passed, and athletes from various countries have not had the chance to show their skills in the World Games. Many new world records will likely be set this session. Among the various competitions this session, the track and field events are the most attention-grabbing, with representative athletes from 59 countries participating. Our country, in this difficult time, also has a delegation of thirty to forty athletes participating. The number of athletes in track and field, swimming, and cycling is relatively small, but the two football and basketball teams hope to have a good performance in the World Games, even if they cannot achieve any victories.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, London, July 27th] The current heatwave sweeping through England is causing headaches for athletes and coaches from various countries. The performance of Nordic athletes in training seems to have been greatly affected by the intense heat, while South American, South African, and black athletes are happy and at ease.</p>
<h3>Wang Zhengting Broadcasts in England on the Mission of the World Games and the Purpose of China's Participation</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, London, July 28th] Wang Zhengting, the general leader of our World Games delegation, stated in a broadcast speech on the London National Broadcasting Corporation today that the 14th World Games, with the participation of over 5,000 representatives from 61 countries, is indeed an effective institution for promoting international understanding and cooperation, which are indispensable for world peace. While reporting on the situation of the World Games to our country in Mandarin on the British National Broadcasting Corporation, Wang expressed his deep gratitude for the warm reception of our delegation by the United Kingdom, and also highly praised the United Kingdom for its efforts to make this grand event a success despite extreme financial and economic difficulties. Wang stated that our country's delegation attending the World Games is not too interested in winning medals, but rather wants to observe the sportsmanship of other countries and study the advanced techniques and organization of the sports world in other countries. He also mentioned the most important steps for our country to improve sports, train better sports instructors, and build more sports fields.</p>
<h3>Our World Games Basketball Team Defeats Switzerland</h3>
<p>[Our Report] London, July 28th Broadcast: The Chinese World Games basketball team defeated Switzerland in a practice match. In the World Games round-robin, they will compete with Korea and the Philippines for the semi-final qualification.</p>
<h3>Li Huitang Talks About Hoping the Chinese Football Team Can Reach the Final</h3>
<p>[United Press, London, July 27th] Li Huitang, the coach of the Chinese World Games football team, hopes that the Chinese football team can advance to the final, but sports reporters generally believe that the World Games football championship team will undoubtedly be from a European country.</p>
<p>Apart from the Indian hockey team, which has a relatively clear hope of winning the championship, the chances of India and Far Eastern countries touching the various championships have become increasingly slim.</p>
<p>The Philippine World Games team is indeed a "strong team." The basketball team is the fifth-seeded team in the World Games. Their coach, Garver, in addition to expressing optimism about their achievements, refused to make predictions. According to experts, the "hard-working" and fast Philippine team will still suffer at the hands of the American team.</p>
<p>Korean athletes have been practicing diligently, but they refuse to make boastful predictions. However, their greatest hope lies with Xu Renfu, the champion of the Boston International Marathon last year.</p>
<h3>Lou Wen'ao in the 5,000 Meters Preliminary Round, Listed in the Second Group</h3>
<p>[United Press, London, July 28th] According to the draw announced on the 28th, two major Far Eastern athletes will meet in the 5,000-meter preliminary round to compete for the final qualification. There are a total of twelve people in the second group of the preliminary round, including Lou Wen'ao from China and Sun Jun from Korea. The top four can participate in the final.</p>
<h3>Paul Withdraws from the World Games</h3>
<p>[United Press, London, July 28th] It was announced on the 28th that Bulgaria has withdrawn from the London World Games. It is also said that the Iron Curtain will force Romania to withdraw before the start of the 28th program. Due to Bulgaria's withdrawal, the number of participating countries has decreased to sixty-one.</p>
<p>[United Press, Prague, July 28th] A spokesperson for the Romanian Embassy stated that Romania may not intend to participate in the World Games. He said that representatives of the Romanian sports community came here for the sports festival and "had many discussions on this matter" and decided not to go to London.</p>
<h3>World Games Track and Field Grouping All Famous Hundred-Meter Athletes Gather</h3>
<p>[United Press, London, July 27th] The World Games Committee, after five days of discussion, released the list of athletes in each group of the track and field competition shortly before midnight on the 27th. With such a grouping of famous track and field athletes, unless there is a major upset, they will not fail to enter the second competition.</p>
<p>The 30th is the first day of the World Games competition. The program includes the 100-meter sprint, in which American athlete Ewell can easily win in the first group. English athlete McQuaid is also listed in the first group, but since two people from each group can advance to the second competition, McQuaid's advancement is not a problem. In the second group, American athlete Batten is only worried about Burling from Canada. Panamanian athlete Labiche is listed in the third group. American athlete Dillard is in the fifth group, and Australian athlete Strickland is in the seventh group. It seems that the above three can undoubtedly dominate in their respective groups. Philippine athlete Rovena is listed in the sixth group, Seychellois athlete Whitde is in the eighth group, and Burmese athlete Mangshan (transliteration) is in the twelfth group. Athletes from the Philippines and India are also listed in this group.</p>
<h3>Hualian Team Wins</h3>

<h3>The Origin of the Olympic Games and the Revival of Modern World Games</h3>
<p>[Special Feature by Our Newspaper] The origin and cause of the Olympic Games have long been lost to history. Judging from the fact that Iphitos in 776 BC was called the "reviver" of the Olympics, the founding of the Olympics dates back more than 2,700 years.</p>
<p>The Olympic Games, since Iphitos restarted it, lasted for thirteen centuries. In 394 AD, the host, Roman King Theodosius, considering the declining morality of the competitors, who often resorted to various despicable means to win the championship, believed that the original spirit of promoting sports and connecting emotions had been completely lost. Therefore, he ordered a permanent ban on the holding of the Olympics. Soon, the statue of Zeus, the king of the Greek gods, was also burned, and the Olympics was suspended for more than 1,500 years.</p>
<p>Revival of the Modern Olympic Games</p>
<p>The revival of the modern Olympic Games, becoming a global event held every four years, must be attributed to Sir Coubertin, a French soldier and scholar. From the army, the knight observed that a sound physique could only come from sports training. Furthermore, from the history of Greece, he studied that the decline of ancient countries was also greatly related to the Olympics. Thus, he engaged in launching a grand World Games plan, hoping that the World Games could connect the cultures of various countries, eliminate the barriers between various ethnic groups, thereby eliminating world war and achieving lasting peace.</p>
<p>In 1893, the knight launched the first step of the plan, sending letters in his private capacity to sports leaders of various countries, suggesting a meeting in Paris the following year to discuss methods for the resumption of the Olympics. As a result of the meeting, it was unanimously passed to hold the first modern World Games in 1896, and it was stipulated that it would be held every four years thereafter.</p>
<p>The First Session Held in Athens</p>
<p>The first World Games were held in Athens, the capital of Greece, to commemorate the ancient Olympics. Thanks to the donation of a nobleman, a large marble stadium, which was already hailed as magnificent and majestic at the time, was built in this ancient cultural capital.</p>
<p>After a series of arduous preparations, the modern Olympics finally opened. Everything was just beginning, and only twelve units participated in the competition. The events were also simple and basic, but they had already aroused the attention of enlightened people around the world, opening up a broad path for the subsequent World Games.</p>
<p>After that, the second, third, fourth, and fifth sessions were held every four years in Paris, St. Louis, London, and Stockholm, respectively. Although the third session had only eight units participating due to the long distance and the ongoing Russo-Japanese War, with a turbulent situation, the World Games were indeed progressing towards perfection, one session better than the previous.</p>
<p>European War Destroys the World Games</p>
<p>Sir Coubertin's ideal was shattered. In 1916, the Olympics not only failed to eliminate war, but was burned down by war. The sixth session was thus aborted.</p>
<p>In 1920, the seventh session was held in the capital of Belgium, which suffered the most from the ravages of the god of war during the Great War. Twenty-five units participated, with 117 events, breaking the records of the previous sessions.</p>
<p>In 1924, Paris hosted the Games for the second time, with forty-five countries participating, and the events gradually became more complete.</p>
<p>The ninth World Games were held in Amsterdam, the capital of the Netherlands. Four thousand athletes from forty-three countries participated in the competition. The ninth session made a major and successful attempt, establishing women's track and field events for the first time.</p>
<p>Our Country's Historic Attempt</p>
<p>In 1932, in the midst of the peak of the world economic crisis, the tenth session was held in Los Angeles. Although due to economic reasons, the number of athletes sent by various countries was far smaller than in previous sessions, the quality was far superior to any previous session. Sixteen world records and twenty-five conference records were broken in this gathering of heroes. Our country also made a historic attempt, sending Liu Changchun, an athlete, for the first time. Although he failed due to natural and acquired reasons, it also renewed the eyes of foreigners and corrected many absurd imaginations of foreigners about China in terms of international perception.</p>
<p>After the first World War, Germany, which became increasingly powerful, hosted the eleventh session in 1936. The scientific mind and fighting spirit of the Germans made this session unprecedented. The largest sports stadium and the most well-equipped World Games Village impressed athletes from fifty-one countries and thousands of tourists from all over the world. It is regrettable that this global conference has reached its peak in terms of material resources, but the spiritual gains are pitifully scarce. The mad war drove away the god of peace again, and the twelfth and thirteenth sessions were aborted in the womb.</p>
<p>The first session after the war has been scheduled to open in London today. In fact, this session is only the twelfth, but from 1896, it has been the fourteenth "Olympiad" (Olmpiad in Greek, originally meaning a four-year period). (Xin)</p>

<h3>Snippets of New Conversations (In Nanjing)</h3>
<p>— Bai Yong</p>
<p>The electricity is cut off one day out of every three. Tonight, it is again a world of darkness. Dark clouds cover the sky, and even the expected moon offers no light. The indoor temperature is a hundred degrees. Everyone is cooling off in the courtyard. Although there isn't much of a breeze to be found, at least the air is stirring a bit. Unfortunately, the rain is coming again, so we have no choice but to trim the candle by the west window. The price of each "Monk's Cap" brand candle has reached 500,000, but there's no other option.</p>
<p>Coincidentally, guests arrived, perfectly fitting the ancient saying of trimming candles and talking in the night rain. The two guests could be called "old friends" or "new friends." As for the former, we were all poor fellow villagers to begin with, and our conversations have something in common. As for the latter, they have already leaped from being poor to becoming "bosses," which puts them in a different category from me, this white-haired scholar who will grow old under the window. However, listening to their "wild tales" is still a source of historical material, "therefore, I record them."</p>
<p>Guest A: "Today, pork is 900,000, and a 'jin' (catty) is only fifteen taels. But it's not fixed. At Shuixi Gate, it sells for 800,000, at Caixia Street it's 640,000, and at Xinqiao it's 720,000. Look, what counts as the standard! The price of soybean sprouts is completely different: 120,000, 100,000, and even 150,000!"</p>
<p>Me: "Let's not talk about this. I heard you've been making a lot of money recently. What business are you doing exactly?"</p>
<p>Guest B: "Don't you know? He's been trafficking in livestock. The last time it was more than 3 billion!"</p>
<p>Me: "Oh? How does that work?"</p>
<p>B (smiling at A): "There was a major flood in Jiangbei this year, and the situation in the Suxian area is even worse. Added to that is the fighting. Livestock are all being sold at low prices. A horse costs no more than 50 million. You can easily earn over 100 million in Nanjing. The villagers are easy to deceive. They don't necessarily pay in cash. After the purchase is settled, they pay a hundred or two upfront, and the rest is paid with promissory notes. Selling on credit for ten days or half a month is nothing. With a quick turnaround, you can make money hand over fist."</p>
<p>A (uneasy, but also self-satisfied): "Don't listen to his nonsense. He stockpiled gasoline half a month ago, and now he's already doubled his profit. Today, he asked me to buy used oil drums. Last week, a drum was 400,000, but in the last few days, it's risen to 220,000, even those made from tin can scraps. Do you know why? Public school employees are allocated oil, and everyone has to buy containers to collect it, so there's been a big fluctuation in the market. It's true, even broken tiles have their day!"</p>
<p>Me: "I never thought that you, who used to be in the used book business and looked down on gold and silver, would be getting involved in this now?"</p>
<p>B: "Can books still be sold? A ream of newsprint costs over 5,000, and a single sheet sells for up to 200,000. Any old book costs over a million. Even if people have money, who would buy these things? Used books are even worse. Firstly, no one reads them, and secondly, the prices don't go up. Look, those used bookstores in Zhuangyuanjing are all selling by weight. The shelves are full of Feng Yuqi novels and patriotic songs. We, who talk about Song and Yuan editions, don't even bother! Several new bookstores from Beiping came to Jiangnan hoping to strike it rich, but they were all disappointed. Those who are willing to use their brains don't sell new books and instead switch back to stationery. Look, isn't a Parker fountain pen equivalent to US dollars? What we're doing is nothing!"</p>
<p>I was stunned, unsure how to respond.</p>
<p>Just then, B finished a cigarette and threw the remaining half-smoked butt on the ground: "Don't look down on this cigarette butt. It's worth a thousand or so. A house used to cost that much, and now it's lightly discarded!"</p>
<p>Everyone burst out laughing.</p>
<p>The rain stopped, and the two figures in plaid cotton disappeared into the shadows.</p>
<p>As I listened to the rain, I pondered this month's cost of living index, wondering how many times it should be multiplied.</p>
<p>Generally, when Western men encounter women on the street, they naturally remove their hats as a sign of respect. Over time, everyone has come to see this as a matter of habit, rarely thinking about the underlying meaning of respecting the opposite sex. In fact, this custom of removing hats to women evolved from an ancient law, the main purpose of which was to force "all inferiors to remove their head coverings before superiors as a sign of respect."</p>
<p>This law can be traced back even earlier to the custom of stripping prisoners of war of their clothing. In ancient times, the Assyrians stripped all prisoners of war of their clothes, showing their complete subjugation. Therefore, nudity was regarded as a form of worship. Even now, the custom of nudity to show respect for "superiors" still exists in some primitive tribal peoples.</p>
<p>As Westerners gradually became more civilized, this custom was slightly modified in form and passed down. In the age of the samurai, warriors were fully armored when they appeared in public. However, when friendly warriors met, they would remove their helmets to show recognition and respect. When these warriors encountered a lady, they would completely remove their armor. They did so to show respect or to reveal their true selves. In any case, there is no doubt that the warriors unknowingly passed on the habit of "inferiors" respecting "superiors" to later generations.</p>
<p>When the samurai system declined, men changed to wearing hats, and they retained the samurai custom of removing helmets for women.</p>
<p>Members of the Religious Society of Friends (Quakers) were somewhat averse to this custom and refused to remove their hats to women. Because they believed that they only had one "superior," that is, God.</p>
<h3>Three Excellent Paintings with Inscriptions</h3>
<p>— Zhang Yiqu</p>
<p>Discussing objects and satirizing the times, the artistic conception is novel,</p>
<p>The people's spirit is not inferior to that of the poet;</p>
<p>A few strokes of the brush, more mellow than wine,</p>
<p>Begging to be drunk in West Lake every spring. (The teacher has lived by West Lake for nearly three years.)</p>
<p>Inscription on Yu Shaosong's Ink Bamboo</p>
<p>Like Su Dongpo's elegant bamboo branches,</p>
<p>The clustered growth, the slender roots, the shadows, are irregular;</p>
<p>The dripping drunken ink is just like you,</p>
<p>Still remembering the time we drank together that year. (In Longyou in 1927, I drank with the teacher all night.)</p>
<p>Inscription on Feng Chaoran's Landscape Painting</p>
<p>Mountains and waters, a wild family's home,</p>
<p>The artistic conception of the painting and the poetic sentiment grow richer with age;</p>
<p>Painting to the point of a tranquil, leisure place,</p>
<p>A crescent moon accompanies plum blossoms.</p>
<p>Marshall's Lunch</p>
<p>According to Washington-based reporter Robert Allen, US Secretary of State Marshall can truly be said to be a "man of few meals and many tasks." There are now as many as 74 diplomatic missions stationed in Washington, breaking all previous records, but Marshall often only eats very casually at his desk in the office, eating only an apple and a bottle of milk for lunch.

<h3>Random Thoughts on Jing'an Temple</h3>
<p>— Chen Zuogao</p>
<p>Jing'an Temple was a famous place for escaping the heat and spending the summer in the late Qing Dynasty. Every summer, tourists came in droves. As the sun set, groups of people would arrive with fans and light shirts. Some brought their families, some brought their concubines. Decorated carriages turned and jade wheels rolled. Even late at night, among the sounds of pines and bamboos, there were still hairpins and earrings left behind. Today, there is an ancient well in front of the temple, located next to a streetcar station, called the Sixth Spring Under Heaven. During the Guangxu period of the Qing Dynasty, a tea house was built on top of it. Tang Jingsong, the famous minister of the Sino-French War, once went to the temple with the Chaozhou scholar Xiao Daonong to see the ancient well. The spring water seemed to be boiling, which was the case every year. They went upstairs for tea cakes. "Women surrounded the seats, charming and lovely, but could not endure the cold and returned." See Tang's "Please Enlist" Diary, entry for October 23rd of the Guangxu 12th year.</p>
<p>Shen Garden was located next to the temple. Huang Xietong's "Record of Dreams in Songnan" described the place as having painted beams and pearl curtains, rising and falling with the morning and evening, showing the grandeur of the buildings and the elegance of the furnishings. When tired of walking, one could lean on the carved railing and sip bitter tea. A fresh breeze would blow away all worldly worries. Sometimes, flower branches would reach out from across the seat, beckoning to people. The sound of hairpins and the shadows of ornaments seemed to be in the curtain, and one would often recite Yuan Xiang's "Drunk, I hear the flowers rising; waking, I hear the orioles," lingering and unable to leave. Downstairs, there were several billiard tables where one could gamble under the moonlight. Western food was also available, but guests had to order in advance to avoid being caught unprepared. It is said that while drinking tea, there were also singers performing to add to the fun. A Shanghai ballad said, "With an appointment at Shen Garden to enjoy tea, hastily ascending the seat to play the pipa. After the song ends, she goes down to the singing building, and the horse-drawn carriages linger at the door." This probably refers to this.</p>
<p>Thirty-two years ago, when I was free on holidays, I would come with old scholars from Zhejiang to the temple to chat over tea. Forerunners such as Gao Yehou and Ding Fuzhi also attended. I occasionally sat at the end of the table, enjoying the eloquent conversations. Thinking back to the temple in those days, flowers were dense, brocade layers, forever soft dust fragrant, and various other beauties filled it. But now the temple grounds are narrower, the scenery is completely different, the surrounding buildings are crowded together, and vehicles converge, just like what Bao Mingyuan called "four-way intersections." Alas, in this noisy city, who would still see it as a scenic spot! Reflecting on the past and thinking about the present, how can one not feel a sense of vicissitudes?</p>
<h3>Love</h3>
<p>— Jin Lin</p>
<p>Only with love is there life. – Romain Rolland</p>
<p>True love is cultivated on respect. – Buckingham</p>
<p>Love can be given, but not bought. – Longfellow</p>
<p>Hate stirs up strife, but love covers all sins. – Proverbs of the Bible</p>
<h3>The Problem of Maids</h3>
<p>— Qifeng</p>
<p>Before the war, hiring one or two maids was not a big deal, but now, in this era of high prices, the problem of maids is quite serious.</p>
<p>As for maids, according to what I've learned from the housewives among my relatives and friends, most of them are complaining constantly. They feel that they can't do without them, but they get angry when they hire them. This is because maids are no longer as "loyal and obedient" as they used to be. The times have instilled in them new knowledge. They have a clear and quick understanding of the decline in currency value and the soaring prices. They are no longer a group of uneducated villagers who can be bullied.</p>
<p>Although maids have not yet progressed to the point of organizing trade unions, their ability to transmit information is no less effective than a perfect organization. In an alley, the amount of wages at a certain house and how the wages are calculated are all found out clearly. If they have fellow villagers or girlfriends in other areas, they also meet frequently to discuss the issue of wages. If you pay them less, they will compare your wages with those of other houses and ask you to increase them. Otherwise, they will find a very good lie, and with the introduction of fellow villagers or friends, they will jump to another house. If they are not satisfied, they will jump again. So often, when your maid leaves saying she is returning to her hometown, after a considerable period of time, she will be discovered at your relatives' or friends' house, which is truly a feeling of laughter and tears.</p>
<p>As for wages, it seems that those who are paid a fixed wage are the most backward and honest. Although the housewife will increase the wage, it is never enough. The second type is based on rice as the standard, ranging from three to four "dou" (pecks) per month. They hope that the price of rice will rise every day. The third type is based on the cost of living index, with monthly "base salaries" of six or seven yuan. The soaring prices do not affect them, but this geometric progression may eventually cause the owners to be unable to bear the burden. The last type is calculated in US dollars. Those who know that the owner's income is converted from US dollars will naturally take the opportunity to make this request.</p>
<p>Maids are progressing too fast. Wise housewives, you must consider, if your maid asks you for a wage calculated in the latter three ways, how will you deal with it?</p>
<h3>Fruit Names</h3>
<p>— Gongsun Wu</p>
<p>"Bolo" (pineapple) is not "boluomi" (jackfruit). The "Dictionary of Sources" explains it very clearly. Perhaps the owners of fruit stalls are unaware of this. Although our country is large, it is now unified, and Taiwan has also been recovered. And freight transportation is now more convenient than in the past. Family treasures and named items should not be confused because of geographical distance. It is especially inappropriate to gain the upper hand by creating differences. Fine things may have different names, but they are not convenient to say. Fruits from California or Australia are not renamed when they arrive in New York or London. If there is confusion in names, it is no different from calling a deer a horse. Take sunflower leaf fans, for example. In the Shanghai market, they are called banana leaf fans. Sunflower leaf fans mostly come from Xinhui, but Jiangsu and Guangdong are not far apart. Why must their names be changed? There are several banana trees in the Shanghai Public Concession. Banana trees are often seen in paintings. The ancients even wrote on banana leaves. How can this be the same thing as sunflower leaves that have been flattened, dried, and made into fans? Wang Yisun was from Kuaiji. His poems contain the line "sunflower fans are hard to keep." The sunflower was known as a sunflower by the Song people. Grapes are planted in Guangdong. They ripen early and are sour. The Cantonese mistakenly call them "bodhi seeds," which is quite ridiculous. It's because there is another thing in the south whose name sounds similar to the word "grape," so they made a false distinction. The character for "eggplant" has two pronunciations. It should be pronounced "jia" in "fanru" (foreign eggplant), but the people of Shanghai like to pronounce it "jia," and "fan" is gradually becoming more cautious. In the north, this thing is sometimes called "fire persimmon." A common thing has multiple names, which proves that the unification of language still has a way to go. The "wen dan" (pomelo) and "zhulei" (another kind of pomelo) are slightly different, but there is no need to force a division. The word "pomelo" is enough. Orange, tangerine, mandarin orange, and kumquat are all citrus fruits and must be distinguished.</p>
<p>###</p>
<p>The matter of amnesty has been rumored for a long time, and there are many different opinions. Some explain it from the perspective of authority (such as the question of whether the Legislative Yuan should propose it, which the Judicial Yuan thinks is possible), some speak from the perspective of facts (such as the opinion of Court President Xia Jun that the amnesty should not be too large), some dislike the remnants of feudalism, and some even focus on the "traitor" aspect. However, examining historical precedents, it is not purely a matter of the ruler's grace, nor is it just a question of reducing or waiving the punishment of criminals. The true purpose of "pardon" and "general amnesty" is that "everyone participates in renewal," which has the highest political and benevolent significance.</p>
<p>Originally, the crimes of criminals are mostly caused by objective conditions. As Western civilization advances, punishments are gradually reduced, and there are also "rehabilitation" and "probation," doing everything possible to reveal the original circumstances and teach people to move upward, all in line with moral philosophy and political principles. The improvement of criminals is the common progress of the ruling class and the intellectual class. This is where civilized countries differ from barbarous ones. Chinese sages often praised "weeping for crime after dismounting the carriage" and "feeling pity rather than joy when understanding the circumstances," all of which have the meaning of forgiveness and mutual blame. The ordinary causes of crime, such as "economic oppression" (the so-called "cold and hunger lead to theft"), are the responsibility of misgovernment; if knowledge is low (greed and violence are all due to insufficient education), then the responsibility lies in mis-education. Therefore, at each autumn review ceremony, ancient emperors reduced their meals and wore plain clothes to express their regret.</p>
<p>As for amnesty, it is only one kind of "grace." "General amnesty" is not limited to imperial celebrations, and the "imperial grace" of imperial celebrations is not limited to "general amnesty." Therefore, "general amnesty" and "imperial grace" cannot be discussed together. The most famous amnesty in history was during the Tang Dynasty's Xinyuan Restoration, which was promulgated by Lu Xuan Gong. Even military men and brave soldiers were moved to tears, because the wording was sincere and fair, showing the unity of the ruler and the ruled. In addition to Zhu Ci, even if Zhu Tao demonstrated obedience, they were also given renewal and forgiveness. And the taxes imposed on bridge frames, bamboo and wood, and the iron monopoly were all stopped, which was a real benefit to the people. Therefore, as soon as the edict of amnesty was issued, all parties were delighted, and they turned toward the dynasty, turning danger into safety. In addition, the amnesty examples recorded in historical books, such as when celestial changes warned of danger, water and drought disasters occurred, and extraordinary disasters and chaos arose, emperors would often issue edicts to review, allowing officials to report on the abuses of both the ruler and the ruled, or report that punishments were too numerous and lawsuits were unjust, offending the harmony of heaven, and then they would consider reducing sentences, and as far as possible releasing those who were guilty of minor crimes or were of doubtful guilt. This was also the meaning of a general amnesty. Since it is said that "everyone participates in renewal," then the ruling class has a past responsibility, and not only do those who are pardoned have the opportunity to renew themselves, but those who grant the pardon must also renew themselves!</p>
<p>The general amnesty of imperial celebrations is not limited to the enthronement of a new emperor. For example, in the third month of Bingzi in the Song Dynasty, Emperor Taizu visited Xijing to worship heaven and earth. The old people said to each other, "Our country has rarely experienced turmoil, and today we see peace again," and some shed tears. After the sacrifice, a general amnesty was issued to express the shared celebration. At this time, it had been more than ten years since Gengshen Emperor Taizu ascended the throne. The following year, Emperor Taizong ascended the throne and changed the era name to "Taiping Xingguo" (Great Peace and Prosperity), and another general amnesty was issued, also to share the meaning of peace.</p>
<p>In modern times, when the former Qing emperors ascended the throne, "granting grace" was the primary meaning. "Granting" also has the meaning of being vast and universal, which is roughly the same as the "general" in "general amnesty." The first requirement of granting grace was "giving preferential treatment in the imperial examination to celebrate the list," which every emperor had to do. And the birthdays of the Empress Dowager and the Emperor were also headed by "granting preferential treatment in the imperial examination." In addition, officials were promoted and given titles, public crimes were forgiven, dismissed officials were given official titles when they followed the ranks to offer congratulations, and old people and farmers were given hat ornaments and red flowers by local officials. In places with arrears of taxes and disasters, the land tax was reduced or exempted. In short, there was always a little grace bestowed, and the general amnesty was not very noticed. Since the Republic of China, some presidents have imitated ancient emperors in issuing general amnesties upon taking office. In the 14th year, Duan Qirui, as the provisional chief executive, also issued a general amnesty decree. Following precedents, in addition to the ten unforgivable crimes, ordinary criminals were reduced or exempted, and Cao Kun was specifically mentioned as not being included in the amnesty. At that time, Mr. Shao, the editor of the Jingbao newspaper, wrote an editorial criticizing this. Cao Kun, no matter what, could not be equated with serious criminals who committed arson and flooded rivers, and Cao was trapped in the Xinhua Palace, not having been tried, nor was he accused of any crime, then whether or not to pardon was fundamentally out of the question. Therefore, the most ridiculous general amnesty of the Republic of China was that of "Chief Executive Duan."</p>
