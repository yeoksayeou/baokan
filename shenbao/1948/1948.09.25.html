<p>〔中央社巴黎廿四日電〕王外長世杰于廿四日聯大會議中，發表演說，全文如次：</p>
<p>余在發言之先，首欲代表本團，對法國之殷　款待，表示謝意，無論就物質上之安適或精神上之靈感而言，殊難有一地如巴黎之能適合吾人之集議者。法國對人類之進化，曾偉偉大貢獻，世界今扔亟需此種貢獻，睿智之法國人民，秉其卓異能力，固可當之　讓，中國代表團同人身居法國，極感愉快。</p>
<p>余就亞洲國家代表之立塲，頃承認聯合國在代表亞洲遠東民族，以及對此遼闊地區各種問題之積極關切方面，均已較舊有國際聯盟有相當進步。然余扔需坦白申言，亞洲及遠東，在安全理事會及涇濟社會理事會中，其代表數額，仍屬不足，在上列兩機構內，中國之聲，乃蘇彝士以東各民族唯一之聲。在過去一年，聯合國之工作中，本人觀察亞洲遠東區之多項問題，均能于聯合國各機構中，受公允之注視，殊覺欣慰。余所特別留意之問題，有韓國之獨立，荷印之爭端與亞洲遠東經濟委員會之工作。主席先生，關于上列問題，余願表示中國認為已有良好之工作成績，而深感滿意，鑒於印度及巴基斯坦調處委員會方展開其袁要任務，故余不欲有所評論。印巴同為中國之友人及隣邦，並為安理會之主要會員國，我中國深望此雙方之困難能藉聯合國之協助，秉和解之精神，獲致解決，並使兩國友誼得以增進。</p>
<p>韓國獨立</p>
<p>（一）韓國獨立問題，本大會對韓國之獨立應續予注意，聯合國赴韓代表團艱巨之工作，由於北韓蘇佔領軍之不願合作，其工作乃更形困難，唯該代表圖在此種不合作之情形下，仍能完成南韓自由民主之選舉，盡其重大之建樹。姑不論各方對前日本在韓國之殖民地統治持任何意見，有一點可以斷言，是旣該統治對韓國人享獨立民主之生活，並未盡力準備。今年春，南轉之總選，乃韓人首次有機會對其國運表示願望。五月十日總選時，登記之選民前往投票者，逾百分之九十。韓國人民表示其亟欲並準備獲得自由自治，實已不容置疑。關於選舉之最後結果，聯合國赴韓代表團本身之判斷極為公允，且為權威性之意見，聯合國秘書長向本大會提出之報吿中，就韓國問題曾有下列一節，余對此殊感欣慰。</p>
<p>一九四八年六月廿五日，聯合國赴韓代表團決定重申其意見如下：一九四八年五月十日之選舉，為該代表團力所能及之韓國各地選民自由意志之有效表現，各該地之居民，佔全韓人口約三分之二。</p>
<p>五月十日選舉之後，韓國人民卽成立其臨時政府，中國政府認為理應予以事實上之承認，吾人欣然鑒及美國和菲律賓政府亦勻予以事實之承認。然聯合國赴韓代表團之工作尙未完畢。該團之協助性努力，未能及於北韓，該團未能派遣觀察員赴緯度卅八度以北之地帶，韓國今仍為一分截之韓國，韓國之將來，對遠東及世界之和平與繁榮關係至巨。韓國人民秉具悠遠之文化，其勤儉之習俗與其對和平之一致效命，不僅應獲得獨立與統一，且在獨立與統一以後，卽可能對遠東之安定盡其貢獻。余籲請大會，對韓國獨立問題之努力勿形鬆懈，吾人必須邁步向前，使韓國人民獲得完全之統一與獨立，中國政府將盡力與其他會員國合，以求達此鵠的，吾人在韓國亳無野心，韓國之獨立愈堅，繁榮愈甚，對中國愈佳。</p>
<p>印尼問題</p>
<p>（二）印尼問題，余認為安理會及其調處委員會對印尼問題之處理，應獲聯合國之感戴，吾人已遏止戰爭，且協力維持停戰狀態，而無重大不幸事件發生，吾人且已於荷蘭政府及印尼共和國政府之間　致最後解決預闢途徑，荷印雙方已筒意，應在平等地位上成立聯合組織。主席先生，余對雙方就此偉大原則　致協議，願表慶賀之忱。在實行倫維爾協定時，曾發生並重之困難，主要皆程序問題方面，調處委員會堅持並無彈性之規定，致困難益見加深。對今後之難端，自不欲加漠視，然余不能想像雙方任一方領袖將容程序問題所使自由民主之目的不能實現。余願就此再提出兩點觀察，荷蘭女皇威廉明娜陛下，年前會吿世界人民謂：殖民地主義業已終止，荷女皇此言，確可綜述此一時代之精紳。余茲敢就此加以註釋，企求自由之民族願望，必須為世界各國所承認，唯有承認所有民族之自決權利，吾人始能希望民族主義不致趨於反常誇大，或成為反國際之形態，此點並形成余之第二點觀察。我中國人民對印尼將達到政治之目的，自感欣忭，余願致望印尼之政治自由，將繼以循行有序之進展，此種進展，由其與近鄰興遠友之合作精神受到鼓勵，而尤以與荷蘭為甚，蓋荷印之間，必留有多種共同之關係也（下文轉入第三版）</p>

<p>社論</p>
<h3>遙望北方的烽火！</h3>
<p>全國住目的濟南地區的主力會戰，到今天已　　九天了！共匪採取「人海戰術」，憑其兵力的集結，節節向城區進迫；我守將王司令官耀武所部　力，雖不及匪軍的三分之一，但士氣振奮，至今猶固守核心，作殊死戰，决與濟南城共存亡。這種「决死戰志」的精神表現，實足動天地而泣鬼神。以整個戰局而論，一城一地的得失，原不必過分重視；但在濟南，因其地據形勝，位處天津徐州兩大據點之間，又為津浦膠濟兩條動脈的交接點，可謂扼我國南北交通的咽喉，自為兵家所必爭之地。唯其如此，濟南的得失，當非普通城鎭可比；全國上下一致注視濟南會戰的發展，其故亦卽在此。誠如魯籍立委呈總統之意見書所稱：「濟南不僅為山東之濟南，而實與徐州及首都息息相關，無論如何，政府應以全力確保。」</p>
<p>我們雖然也同樣主張中央應迅派大軍赴援，保衛此一歷代之名城重鎭，但我們認為軍事當局應透視共匪的「秋季攻勢」，對於東北·華北·以及濟南地區的戰事，應作一個全盤的打算，不宜過於頭痛醫頭，脚痛醫脚，把精銳部隊東派西調，疲於奔命·或反中了共匪聲東擊西的奸計·這次共匪結集大軍，不下三十萬人之衆，進攻濟南地區，不惜孤注一擲，對於濟南似乎勢在必得·但我們透視共匪的整個作戰計劃，其目的恐不盡在濟南，而其最大的企圖，在於東北，在於華北。一般軍事觀察家均謂，共匪此次發動「秋季攻勢」，不僅是軍事的，而且是政治的，甚至於可說兼帶着經濟的。一</p>
<p>現在正是秋禾成熟新穀登塲的時候，而今年東北和華北得天時之獨厚，風調雨順，可稱「大有之年」，在廣漢的原野上，目下正是一片「高粱肥，大豆香」的景象，這對於共匪是怎樣的一大誘感。我方早已用軍隊掩護，在各地協助農民「快割，快運，快打塲，快收塲。」此對於共匪，不啻芒刺在背，使其不得不提前發動「秋季攻勞」。共匪不僅要掩護他自己的秋收，而且還要破壞國軍的秋收。軍糧的充足與否，往往是决定勝敗的重要因素，何况共匪稱兵作亂的目的，就是在造成國內經濟上的恐慌以拖垮國民政府，而實現其奪取政權的野心。過去三年來，每經過一次大規模會戰，共匪在軍事上未必有何成就，但在經濟上刺激政府區內物價上漲，共匪終引以為它莫大的收穫。而今政府實行幣制改革，已獲初步成功，不僅物價穩定，而且人心大定，共匪自然更要在軍事上發動攻勢，造成政府區內的騷動與恐慌。這是共匪發動秋季攻勢的眞正目的。有人說共匪攻勢乃在打擊「金圓」，似乎也是一針見血之談。</p>
<p>遙望北方的烽火，共匪的「秋季攻勢」，首先於本月十一日在遼西開始，企圖破壞錦榆的鐵路交通；接着灤東戰爭又起，十四日共匪攻佔昌黎；十七日濟南戰事轉緊，到今天正是半個月，它的目的與野心，早就暴露無遺。共匪在東北，先謀孤立錦州，再圖不戰而攻佔瀋陽長春，把整個東北吞下去。共匪在華北，則從灤東下手，順義三河之戰，企圖威脅平津。共匪在山東，以為佔領濟南，就可阻止國軍增援華北。如此，它以軍事為手段，妄想達成其政治上的野心。毛澤東曾場言在「秋季攻勢」之後，卽可在華北擇一地點召鬨「新政協」，組織「華北人民政府」，這就是一個絕好的證明。至於共匯何以如此急欲「成功」？這個問題惟有從國際局勢中獲得解釋了。共產勞力刻正向西歐步步進迫，柏林危機的無法解决，顯示出蘇聯與西方民主國問的緊張。但蘇聯又欲乘西方各國注意力集中歐洲的時侯，企圖在亞洲同時有所行動，東南亞已開始行動了，但亞洲的關鍵在中國，中共如果「成功」（？），東南亞就可一帆風順，不致再有問題，紐約世界日報評述遠東局勢，早就指出了共匪的陰謀，可謂有獨到之處。</p>
<p>要之，我們首先要求軍事當局迅定大計，在軍事上立卽變被動為主動，粉碎共匪的「秋季攻勢」。其次，希望在後方的國人，集中意志，動儉建國，堅决擁護政府經濟改革方案的貫澈，卽使共匪的「秋季攻勢」在軍事上或有若干成就，一城一地或有進退得失，也仍應該堅定信念，勿動搖，勿自擾，務使共匪不能達到其此次「秋季攻勢」在政治上經濟上的目的！</p>

<h3>朝鮮希臘否决權三問題　蘇再要求剔出議程　聯大各國代表為和平呼籲</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕巴黎廿四日廣播：聯大會今晨舉行時，烏拉圭代表首先發言，籲請聯大集中更大努力，從事建立國際法紀。南非代表發言，抨擊聯合國朱能遵守憲章之精神，並警告聯合國勿再干涉他國內政，否則南非將退出聯合國。丹麥代表指出該國邊境之德難民危及其安全，旋主席伊伐特宣告休會。又中國王外長及緬甸代表均出席致詞。</p>
<p>又訊：繼昨日在綜合委會之失敗後，蘇代表馬立克今日復在大會中提出要求，謂有三種問題，不應列入議程，其一為對准許入會之否決權，其二為希臘與朝鮮問題，其三為對蘇聯運反人權之指責。馬立克稱，此種問題如予以討論，對於聯合國決無補益，而必使聯合國重蹈以前國聯覆轍。</p>
<p>〔合衆社巴黎廿四日電〕聯合國大會廿四日聽取宣佈戰學為非法之呼籲，呼籲係緬甸首席代表馬洪所發出，事實上此係首次大戰後白里安（法外長）凱洛格（美國務卿）非戰公約之復活，然公約早已無疾而終矣。馬洪要求本屆大會應儘先討論維特世界和平之方法。「吾人首先應通過決議，重申聯合國憲章序言之原則，即各會員國此次咸來出席三屆聯大，誠意希望和平，且在任何條件下決不與他國作戰。」大會於上午十時三刻開始時，五十八國代表均因戰爭之威脅而戰戰兢兢。一般認為蘇聯不久將發表兩項重要文告，恐將決定聯大及世界長期之歷史·此二者即蘇首席代表維辛斯基之政策演說，及蘇聯對西方因柏林危機所致新照會之覆文，如克林姆宮答覆不能使人滿意，而維氏再度破口漫駡，則國際間改善局勢之指望將成泡影矣。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社巴黎廿三日電〕廿三日在聯大會中發言者共六人，最重要者為美國務卿馬歇爾，其堅決與和緩之論調曾博得一般同情。其他發言者皆堅主聯合國之最主要任務，為將戰爭之怪物永遠擯絕，並以不同之方法略述彼等對世界公正政治機構之概念。叙利亞代表柯里謂渠主張廣啟聯合國之門戶，以容納各主權國，並希望大會能克服安理會對此所置之障碍。委內瑞拉代表對於戰後世界政治道德之低落極為扼腕，謂此僅使往日之仇對主義與歧視復活耳。埃及代表述及巴勒斯坦事件，質問強以外人數十萬移植於巴勒斯坦而為聖地之主人，此其影響將威脅全世界之安全。</p>
<h3>馬歇爾貝文會談　對柏林事件次一步驟意見一致　史密斯奉召返華府述職</h3>
<p>〔合衆社巴黎廿四日電〕美國務卿馬歇爾廿四日再就柏林危機，與英外相貝文舉行會議。自員文返倫敦出席緊急　議後返抵此間迄今，兩人尚係初度聚首。在倫敦時，貝文曾在下院發表外交宣言稱，如冬季仍須維持柏林空運，西方三國對次一步驟意見已完全一致。馬貝兩人淸晨會議，故馬氏趕赴聯大開會時，已吿遲到。英美外長會談時，主持莫斯科談判之英美兩使節史密斯及羅柏茲亦在座，此點頗堪重視。</p>
<p>〔合衆社巴黎廿三日電〕英代表蕭克洛斯答覆記者之詢問，顯示如三強對蘇聯之答覆仍感不滿時，卽擬將柏林問題提交聯合國。</p>

<h3>巴黎聯合國大會中我王外長演說全文</h3>
<p>亞經工作</p>
<p>〔上接第一版〕（三）亞洲遠東經濟委員會，余茲欲就亞洲遠東經濟委會之工作，提出若千觀察，在聯合國無數附屬機構之中，經濟社會理事會所屬亞洲遠東經濟委員會，實獨具卓異之地位。因該會之任務，在促進亞洲遠東一半人類之經濟進步。主席先生，余個人及本國政府敢謂，我國之鄰邦，皆企求現代科學與現代技術之利益，貧窮為亞洲遠東之重要課題，全世界如有一值得從事之戰爭，則必為對抗匱乏之戰爭。亞洲逮東經濟進步之主要責任，自應由該區各國政府及人民自行肩負，但工業進步之國家，實可盡極大之協助。主席先生，余不擬在本大會進行一般辯論時，詳述亞洲遠東之經濟問題，但願趁此陳述余所說如此一問題之指導原則，吾人希望亞洲之經濟發展能籍國際合作而加速推進，但認為外方國家必不能干涉各民族自願接受並予發展之社會經濟制度。遍視世界各地殊無任何預先製就之社會制度，可以逕而輸入亞洲。吾人今保留本身之權利，且將如保存發展符合吾人需要，以及吾人社會公平理想之社會制度之權利而鬥爭。亞洲遠東經濟委員會曾舉行三次會議，吾人認為委員會之工作，主要言之係逐步進展。該委員會首須收集資料，然吾人希望其不致成為學術性之機構，該委員會固須舉行會議，制定決議，而吾人希望各次決議不致徒成具文。亞洲遠東經濟委員會最近在印度開會時，建議成立洪水防治局，經社理事會亦因鑒及影響亞洲及遠東各大河流域，以百萬計人民生活之洪水防治問題之極端重要與迫切，已通過設立，本人對此感及愉快。在此重要之經濟改進方面，某種建設性集中性及合作性之努力，將卽時獲得亞洲人民之關注與支持。吾人因此希望此項工作將能及早開始，此種工作可能成為聯合國於行政方面，推進建設性合作之佳例。</p>
<p>經社進展</p>
<p>（四）經濟社會理事會。在檢討經社理事會一區城委負會之工作，余願對經社理事會本身之一般進展，稍為敘述。關於經社理事會多方面之活動，余願特別強調其兩項勇敢之努力。其一為關於取消國際貿易壁壘者，另一為關於促進世界新聞自由者。以上兩種努力，均有顯著成就，一已簽訂協定，一已成立草約，中國之經濟發展，及國內政治局勢，雖未如期望中之進步與穩定，然其對聯合國此種建設性努力之熟烈決心支持，從不後人，主席先生，中國代表團相信為求促進經社理事會之工作，會員國必須時時準備盡量將一己國家之考慮，置諸國際合作需要之下。</p>
<p>否決權案</p>
<p>（五）否決權問題。中國代表團欣然鑒及聯大上屆會議，要求其研究否決權問題之駐會委負會，已提出一經過周密工作而後完成之報告。在此方面聯合國大會應對駐會委會之建議，予以考慮。駐會委會列舉若干理事會可能之決議，認為無疑為程序性質。因之不應受否決權限制。同時亦舉出若干事項，認為與政治關係較少。因此安理會常任理事國，如能同意卽可置於一致通過規則範圍以外。委員會亦建議其認為安理會常任理事國，應正常遵守之使用否決權之規定參駐委會建議之若干此種措施，對於困難問題之消除，似屬大有裨益。中國政府認為聯合國憲章中所規定之否決權，目的在使安理會可能作之每一實質性質之決定，均獲有最高度之權威。規定否決權之主要用意，為增高聯合國之威信，而非予以抑低。然如否決權給予濫用，聯合國之主要機構卽可能因此而陷入痳痺狀態，因之安理會各常任理事國，對否決權之運用，應愼重將事，並應尊重聯合國憲章條款之合理解釋，可能對權力使用範圍所加之限制。</p>
<p>普遍和平</p>
<p>（六）普遍和平問題。余在結結此講詞之前，願一述普遍和平問題。維持和平顯非可由某一種單獨努力或某一單獨機構能予完成者。戰爭與和平係由多方面之力量，在多方面構成者。此一問題與歷史同等悠久，政治經濟與戰略，對此問題均曾施以重大影響。在中國有記載之三千年歷史中，具有戰爭與和平問題之各種經驗，中國有時曾為勝利之征服者，亦會有時為其他民族所征服，惟在吾人長久之經驗中，從未犯有以私念強加諸人之罪行。吾人一向容其他人民保守其宗教習慣及其經濟政治制度，各民族若認中國文化具有價值，並願取去，吾人均表歡迎，然吾人從未意圖將此人之方式加諸他人。主席先生：余之所以提出此事，主要係因當前吾人所面臨之和平問題之一主要點，卽係此種觀念之衝突，可能除歐洲卅年戰爭期間外，余不能記及歷史上各國由於思想衝突而致彼此間關係極其複雜錯綜，其情形有若目前之甚者，關於此種衝突之一般性討論，誤　世界人民必須在共產主義及資本主義之間擇一而從，事賞上則尚有其他可能。例如中國，卽相信中華民國創立者所稱為民生主義之原則，此與共產主義及資本主義均不相同。任一國家，若以任何方式將一種觀念加於另一國家，為一不可能而又危險之事。吾人必須在二十世紀中葉再度學取十七世紀中葉歐洲人民所學取者，卽容忍是也。教會間之歧見，自屬現仍存在，並有人民各自可按其本身想法而估計之各種眞正分校，然文明社會已知悉人民固可各自以不同方式崇奉其上帝，無論何人，按其本身方式信仰何種宗教，渠必須亦尊重他人之宗教習慣。歐人以卅年戰爭之代價所獲關於宗教之認識，吾人亦應不循卅年戰爭而在經濟與社會制度方面習取之，此意並非世界不能具有共同之信仰，事實上吾人必須擁護吾人均應信仰聯合國憲章之基本觀念，吾人對此應均具信心，然除此而外，吾人均須實行容忍，世界和平若得維持，則目前之思想戰必須代之以容忍。同時吾人對其憲軍曾為吾人鄭重接受並簽字之聯合國，亦應竭力增強其權威。主席先生：余願再在此說明一點，安理會之任一理事國，尤其常任理事國，若對一無力之聯合國開始感及滿足時，在此時際，此國卽已不忠於世界和平或其本身矣。余在聯大第二屆大會時曾稱，聯合國已達一階段前途發展，或甚至可能其存在均在飄搖之中，過去一年中之情形，並未能使吾人之焦慮稍减如謂稍有區別，則可謂當前之局勢較一年前似尤嚴重，吾人今日集會，世界局勢之各主要方面，此時均不較一九三九年為佳，因此吾人擁護世界和平之責任，較上次會議時更為加重，亦更為迫切，惟有彼此更為容忍，並澈底明瞭吾人在憲章下所負之責任，吾人始可希望各國終有眞正聯合之一日。中國對此偉大之任務，其決心與貢獻，決不後人。（完）</p>

<h3>擾亂金融罪正法第一人　王春哲昨執行槍決　遺書痛責鄭嘉裕逍遙法外</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕因犯擾亂金融罪而受嚴懲之第一人，林王公司經理王春哲，昨經特種刑庭執行死刑。</p>
<p>王春哲自經本年九月三日特種刑庭判處極刑後，曾向首都中央特種刑庭志請覆判，中央特庭於廿二日判決仍處極刑，廿三日派專人抵滬，將該項判決書及執行命令送達本市特庭，判決書之主文為：「原判決關於王春哲部份，撤銷。王春哲共同連續意圖妨害戡亂擾亂金融，處死刑，擬奪公權終身。林同識，鄭禮恭無罪部份，核准。」特庭於昨日下午一時卅分將王自看守所中提出。王面色白净，着細方格麻紗短衫褲，黃皮鞋，見警衛森嚴，均荷槍實彈，知死期已至，惟態度尙鎭靜。先押於待質室內。一時四十分李毓龍檢察官升座，卽簽提王到庭，首訊年籍：王稱：「年三十六歲，廣東汕頭人」。李檢察官卽告以本案已由中央特種刑庭判處死刑，幷飭執行，你尙有何遺言？王卽連呼死得寃枉，買賣黑市金鈔均係鄭嘉裕所為，渠在國外，實不知情。</p>
<h3>勸慰老母怨恨表弟</h3>
<p>繼卽索紙筆，寫遺書兩封，一致其母：「母親：你聽到我執行極刑，用不着悲痛，人生幾十年，終須一死，不過我死的是太寬枉，主犯實是表弟鄭嘉裕，他帶了我的現款，逍遙法外，可教他早日自殺謝罪，以免再害他人。至於我在滬財物，託愷姪及二兄淸理後，全交你老人家。大姊羣弟為我事來滬奔走，我衷心很是感激，但命已如此，非人力所能挽回。最後，我欲告世人者，我死亦無憾，因為我沒有對不起國家或個人的地方，祗有國家對不起我，我所努力的出口外匯兌給國家，却沒有一點功勞，他人做的事，犯的罪，全嫁在我身上，充其量，我不過用人不當吧了。</p>
<p>另請愷侄轉慰諸女友，請勿悲傷，世上好男子多得很，祝康健。你的不孝的兒子春哲。</p>
<h3>囑侄轉慰女友</h3>
<p>另一致其侄王忠愷：「愷：你可把我的財物淸理，送亞菱（按卽其女友，王尚未結婚。）一萬金圓。祝努力學業。哲。」信寫完後，卽凖備執行，王請求注射麻醉針，李檢察官告以無此設備，給以高梁酒一盌，王一飲而盡。二時十分綁赴上海監獄後刑塲，一檢畢命，彈由後腦進自右鼻樑出。</p>
<h3>侄兒趕至領屍備殮</h3>
<p>事後，王侄忠愷聞訊趕來，（忠愷在國立上海商學院工商管理系三年級肄業），打電話至萬國殯儀館，五時許將屍體軍去。</p>

<h3>工業原料供應問題當已商討調節辦法　黛玉晴雯子鴻鈞等昨宴工業金融界領袖</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕俞鴻鈞·蔣經國·劉攻芸，昨晚七時聯名在央行大規模宴請本市工業金融界領袖人士，徐寄廎·李銘·杜月笙·吳蘊初·結雲章·劉鴻生·金潤庠·胡西園·劉　基·潘士浩·胡伯翔·洪念祖·楊管北·王啟宇等均出席·吳市長·吳局長及物資供應局輸管會各機構負責人均被邀作陪。席間談話集中今後本市工業原料之供應問題，賓主僉認為上海為一製造中心，需吸收各地之工業原料，目前其他各地之原料價格高於上海，將來經管機關將制定一切合實情之調節原料辦法，以維持本市工業生產之順利進行，並為加強效率起見，將由各業公會間密切聯繫，加強原料之聯合配售及各廠成品之聯合配售。</p>
<h3>不得停工減工</h3>
<p>蔣督導員並卽席表示：為求增產起見，工廠不得無故停工或減工。當時出席之工業界人土卽答覆謂：在停工减工期內工資照付，故工廠決不會故意停工或减工，减工停工現象之所以發生，有其客觀之原因，尚需經管當局之協助予以解決。宴會至十時許始散。</p>
<h3>勉黨員攤販應以身作則</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕蔣督導員經國以最近取締黑市檢查囤積工作，已略著成效，惟與民生有密切關係之蔬菜市塲，其供應情形迄仍未臻理想，故前日乘國民黨市黨部召集十六區黨部幹部談話機會，特蒞市黨部，對二百餘蛋業·油業·鷄業·肉業·蔬菜業·魚鮮業黨員攤販，懇切詢問渠等目前交易情形。市黨部主委方治，書記長謝仁釗等均列席參加。</p>
<p>各業攤販紛紛叫苦</p>
<p>肉業攤販表示以前豬肉批價每斤為四角八分，近已增為五角五分，若照限價每斤七角二分出售，因批進時係迎豬頭皮骨在內，實際無甚盈利，故希望能將批價合理降低。蛋業攤販表示近鷄蛋缺之，係因各冷藏公司搜集供出口外銷，故目前祗有多多供應鴨蛋，惟仍望當局設法疏通來源。蔬菜業亦陳述因運費等關係，盈餘有限之苦衷。</p>
<p>種種困難當代解决</p>
<p>蔣督導員卽席示，攤販目前種種困難，當設法代為解決，批發商如不遵批發價儘量供應，當絕對嚴懲，惟八一九之限價，無論如何須切實遵守，亦須儘量供應，尤希黨員攤脈以身作則，發生示範作用，俾一般人民日常生活不致蒙受影響。最後蔣督導員提出渠在巡視各菜市塲時，會見魚蝦甚多，而購者極少詢各攤販原因，據答係因限價較高所致，蔣氏表示，對此當再加調查，決定適當措施。</p>

<h3>警局偵緝科警員等三人　被控貪汚案開審　三被吿供述受託代轉金款經過聖喬琪經理未到諭候改期再訊</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕市警察總局偵緝科警員邵關榮及邵亮，朱秉熙被控貪汚罪嫌一案，地院方祥海推事，昨午開刑四庭將在押之三被告提到開審。邵關榮供稱：渠於九月四日奉派前往滬西。浦東辦案，迄晚回家，渠妻告知邵亮畫間曾數次來家，留下金子二兩，金圓一百元，請渠轉交警局科員馮秀山，並未告知金款用途，渠與告訴人吳根生素不相識，周邵亮則為多年老友，其他概不知情。</p>
<p>僅知係還欠款</p>
<p>邵亮（天福鼎釘子廠交際主任）供稱：九月三日晚，朱秉熙問渠在警局有無熱饑朋友，因渠有友吳根生前欠警局馮秀山款項，不便往還，擬託渠代還馮某。渠因與邵關榮奮識，允之，遂於九月四日數次往訪未遇，乃將金子二兩，金圓一百元，交邵妻請邵轉交馮某，僅知此係吳根生償還馮某之欠款，不知有他。朱秉熙（德豐運輸公司副經理）供：渠於十年前，因侵占訟事，曾被處刑三月，與告訴人吳根生為舊友。吳前與渠談，警局偵緝科長馮起出將因案拘吳，吳恐吃官司，渠因與馮起山相識，乃受託往問馮起山有無其事，起山答稱不知，囑轉詢警員痛快秀山，秀山告有其事，並稱吳根生當自知被拘理由。九月二日吳與茅某者到揚子飯店尋渠，告稱欠秀山舊款，託渠代致，渠未允，乃託邵亮轉交。</p>
<p>正推辭間被捕</p>
<p>九月四日吳以電話約渠於六日下午往大三元相晤，屆時吳稱因欠秀山舊款太多，前償之數不敷，尙有餘未，仍請渠代轉，渠雅不願，正推辭間，卽為便衣警拘捕。當時吳乃對渠稱：「你是我請出作證的，不管你的事，應照實說。」庭上追問：「你在被捕時，在你身上搜出金圓五百元確實否？」朱供稱：「否，當時金圓放在　子上，我正在推却。」至此，庭上以告訴人聖喬琪花園飯店經理吳根生未到庭，本案案情曲折，諭令放期再訊。各被告請求交保不准，仍予還押，至一時許退庭。</p>

<h3>糧食來處不易籲請珍視碎米</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕民食調配會以外界對本月份配米遲緩，頗多不明眞相，昨由調配處負責人發表談話稱：目前配售糧源，均由糧部統籌，民調會僅負分撥責任。為冀配米迅速入於市民之手，故現在米船抵埠，已不轉倉庫，立卽直接車送各米店，民調會實已　其最大之努力。又外界對於碎米多不表示歡迎，此非選購不力，因向國外購運米糧，整米必須搭配碎米，且價格相同。際此戰後糧食供應困難，而太市全面配售已逾半年，糧部對於此事亦已盡其最大努力。昨日到埠之　聞　及今日抵滬之海黃　，成功輪，碎米亦佔頗大之數字，希望市民在此勤儉節約聲中，　念米粒雖有整碎，但來處不易，仍應予以珍視。</p>

<h3>犯罪行為證據確鑿仍處極刑以昭炯戒　王春哲案中央特庭判決書</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕王春哲覆判死刑，執行槍決，茲將中央特種刑庭判決書原文探錄於後：「本件聲請人王春哲，於民國卅六年與林名堅合夥，開設林王公司，於上海北京路一三一號勝利後改為林王商行，由王春哲獨資經營，自任經理，聘鄭嘉裕為副理。王春哲又與王聲和，王樹楠夥開聯盛行，設於問一處所，亦由王春哲為經理。該兩行與汕頭林王公司（王春哲為股東兼副理，林名堅股東兼經理）為聯號，香港則委託泰崑公司鄭庭教代辦業務，以經營紗布花邊橡膠進出口為掩護，大規模經營各種黃金美鈔港幣黑市買賣，並利用電信經營各種外匯，另備賬册，以「豆」「糖」「米」「麵」「粉」「尤」等暗號，代替「黃金」「美鈔」「港幣」，以「担」代替「兩」等為交易收付之用。</p>
<p>足以影響全國</p>
<p>於賬冊中可查考者自卅七年一月廿三日起，至三月十日止，買賣港幣及私套港匯，計收入港幣或港匯一百五十三萬二千八百八十二元零七分，付去港幣或港匯共一百九十八萬四千六百十二元零六分。卅七年一月至四月，共私套港匯卅五萬三百零三元，又卅七年三月九日至十五日收入美鈔或美匯計十四萬七千六百六十六元二角六分，卅七年三月九日至五月六日付去美鈔或美匯計十五萬元三千二百九十五元二角六分。又卅七年三月十八日至四月廿六日，買八黃金一百九十六兩八錢九分五厘，賣出一百九十六兩五錢四分西厘，內有美紗一千七百五十四元，換得黃金三十兩，又以黃金十兩三錢二分五厘，換得美金五百五十七元。與上海瑞康誠錢莊，大同銀行，大通銀行，均有款項往來。交易地區遠達紐約，舊金山，倫敦，香港，汕頭，實為上海大規模擾亂金融組織，足以影響全國經濟，釀成社會不安等情。</p>
<p>原判尙非無見</p>
<p>原審採取聲請人之供述，及於聲請人住所華懋飯店，搜出林王商行各項賬册，經金融管理局核算查明，確有以熊記·哲記·裕記·泰崑·同榮聯發等戶名，大規模經營金鈔套匯等情形，曁鄭嘉裕致王春博函中有「目下金融管理局，對於各項偵查極嚴，港滬間之通訊，已全部改用代名詞，茲照錄上一份……港匯（尤）……美應（糖）……」等語，予以認定，幷以其罪情重大，依戡亂時期危害國家緊急治罪條例第五條第一項第十款量處極刑，尚非無見。</p>
<p>聲請辯護意旨</p>
<p>聲請及辯護意旨，　列多斕，其大要不外（一）戡亂時期危害國家緊急治罪條例，本含有政治性質，其內容均以破壞國體，　覆政府為對象，被告　令負黑市買賣黃金外幣外匯之責，亦僅係單純的擾亂金融行為，　或影響戡亂工作，但不　謂為目的在乎妨害戡亂。（二）買賣金鈔外匯行為，係鄭嘉裕私人遠法，聲請人不能負其責。（三）聲請人於卅六年九月十九日出國，至卅七年四月廿六日返抵上海，對於鄭嘉裕之舞弊營私，更屬無從過間。</p>
<h3>緊急治罪條例不以奸匪為限</h3>
<p>本庭按戡亂時期危害國家緊急治罪條例，固以妨害戡亂危害國家之犯罪為對象，但不以處罰政治性質之奸匪為限，凡行為合於該條例之規定，均應處罰。大規模之黑市買賣黃金外幣外匯，足使金融紊亂，黑市猖獗，妨害戡亂工作，至深且鉅，稍具經濟常識者，類能知之，聲請人曾受高等教育，經營進出口業務，更能深予認識，認識其為妨害戡亂而仍容許為之，自屬為預見其發生，而其發生不違反本意，自難謂其無妨害戡亂之意圍。又聲請人為林王商行經理，鄭嘉裕為副經理，則該行所有業務行為，聲請人自應負其全責·矧該記載買賣金鈔外匯賬册，均係聲請人私人處所搜出，更何得諉為鄭嘉裕個人之所為。</p>
<p>早已由港返國</p>
<p>再聲請人自去年九月起至同年十一月止，旅行國外，固有出國護照可證，但查其自同年十二月起，即由香港返國，不特有林名堅致擊請人信件可據，幷有該行逐日記付王經理王春哲賬目可考，况查該行經營黃金美鈔外匯，直至本年五月六日為止，尤不得諉鄭嘉裕營私舞弊，無從過問。空言飾卸，均無足採。惟杳聲請人經營黃金外幣外匯，係以概括故意，反複數行為而犯同一罪各，原判未依刑法第五十六條論處，尚婊疏漏。又聲請人係以一個連續犯罪行為，因法律錯雜而觸犯數個法條，自應認數個法規中擇一適用，原判誤以觸犯黃金外幣買賣處罰條例第一條，及中央銀行管理外匯辦法，不過為擾亂金融之方法，依刑法第五十五條從一重處斷，亦嫌違誤，應予撤銷改判，幷審酌其情節，仍予科　極刑，以昭　戒。中華民國三十七年九月二十二，中央特種刑事法庭第一庭　判長樓　光審判官葉友棠張文　　恭成殷汝熊」。</p>

<h3>香港永安貨倉燃燒卅二小時　大火熄滅　掘出屍首一一五具</h3>
<p>〔本報廣州廿四日電〕港大火直至廿三日下午四時始熄滅，計已掘出屍首一一五具，永安貨倉尚未發掘，內有屍首若干未悉。</p>
<p>〔本報香港廿二日航訊〕香港西環的永安貨倉，廿二日上午八時發生大火，在最近一個月內，香港的貨倉發生大火的，已達三次之多，除海軍船塢貨倉損失藥品八十萬元外，上次九龍倉和這次永安貨倉，損失都在一千萬元以上，誠屬港商當前的一個「浩刧」！</p>
<p>自動爆炸</p>
<p>這次永安貨倉起火，也是由於化學藥品因氣候關係自動爆炸，貨倉在電車路旁，為四層樓的民房改成，一連四間，樓上俱屬民居，因此，這回除貨物損失外，還有葬身火坑的慘劇，死亡的慘重，損失的浩大，比諸上海今年九江路堆棧的大火，有過無不及。</p>
<p>據火塲逃生的口述，起火前突聞一陣爆炸聲自貨倉發出，地下圍塲卽崩裂一個大洞，有五六桶東西目倉內拋出，其中一桶是膠狀物品，散在路上，立刻焚燒，當時剛有電軍一輛經過，有一火球幾乎擊中車廂，至為驚險。二·三·四樓住客被烟燄封鎖逃生之路，有會忙從二樓躍下而致受傷者，凡十餘人，而冒火烟奪門而出焦頭爛額者，達數十人，葬身火坑者一時尚無法查明。</p>
<p>貨物山積</p>
<p>香港在短短一個月內而發生了三次的貨倉火災，這個事實可說明香港存下的貨物，因受國內管制，無法運出者，已達「堆如山積」的程度，管理失週，慘劇遂起，這些貨物聽說屬於國內鉅商購存者，亦為不少。</p>
<p>貨物中以顏料，哥士的等化學原料和油類佔最大宗，據說也有一部份五洋雜貨。</p>
<h3>火災又一起</h3>
<p>北河戲院膠片室失愼</p>
<p>〔合衆社香港廿四日電〕二十三日晚，香港北河戲院膠片儲藏室又不愼失火，波及臨近住屋，死二人，傷九人，此次火災，已為最近一周內接蹤而起之大火災之第四次，而美次均發生于易燃品之堆藏庫中。</p>

<h3>邊疆「淘金客」末路　迪化貪官汚吏給落法綱</h3>
<p>— 本報特約記者　長靑</p>
<p>〔迪化廿二日航訊〕「嚴懲貪汚」，是張治中氏治理新疆的主要政策之一。但由於內地人到邊疆去，多懷有淘金的幻想，這種不健全的心理，積重難返，一時尚不能根絕，所以邊疆民族對內地去做事的公務人員，一律稱呼為「傷腦筋」。這一般「傷腦筋」在今天已走上末路，前任建設廳副應長顧謙吉之被提起公訴，便是很明顯的事實。其他大小貪汚案件亦層見迭出。</p>
<p>副廳長　藉公圖利</p>
<p>謙吉現年四十四歲，江蘇無陽人，畜牧專家，原任新疆血淸廠廠長，卅五年新疆省政府改組後，卽受任為建設廳副廳長，是代表中央的省府委員七人之一。今年二月間，現任建設廳副廳長劉德恩及該廳會計主任茍廷相，視察主任倪祖新等，聯名向西北行轅檢舉顧謙吉貪汚，一時轟動迪化政界，而為全疆人士所注目，當局卽將顧謙吉押送迪化地方法院檢察處偵查，經檢察官半年之偵查及搜集證據，遂於上月提起公訴，起訢書的要旨有三：</p>
<p>（一）被吿於卅六年十月廿一日以血淸廠名義，向建設廳煤礦廠借得貧民冬炭救濟費省幣八千萬元，（過去新疆省幣一元兌法幣五元，以下數字均以省幣計算），十一月廿五日又借二千萬元，顯有私人挪用公款之嫌。</p>
<p>（二）建廳在渝之機器甚多，被告曾提請省府會議通過由渝運迪，運費通過為六億元，實領四億元，被告於卅六年十二月下旬領取該款後，卽私人匯往上海嘉定銀行李交德兩億五千萬元，餘一億五千萬元除支給建廳顧問子大新一千五百萬元購買布疋，墊發職員十一月補薪五千萬元，借予南疆防疫隊一千萬元，血淸廠製造疫苗五百萬元，並借發職員年賞七百萬元外，餘均由被告私人挪用。</p>
<p>（三）建設廳編譯有關科學書籍七千萬元，已於卅六年十二月下旬領到，除正當開支四百萬元外餘均由被告購買布疋·香烟等。以上被告挪用公款私人圖利行為，在法律上已可構成犯罪事實。</p>
<p>地院刑庭受理後，曾開調查庭三次，公開合議審判庭一次，順　吉對所提三點，均有答辯：</p>
<p>（一）自煤廠廠借款兩次，僅有一億元，本人並未指明在貧民冬炭救濟費項下硬借，且所借乃因其妻息病，本人毫無積蓄，迫於情急，以私人名義借貸者，均巳全部歸還。</p>
<p>（二）運機器專款之分配，除起訴所列各項外，餘均作職員之旅費及安家費，不能說本人挪用，購物事亦屬子虛。</p>
<p>（三）編譯書籍七千萬元，除付出有單據一千餘萬，至六千六百萬購布疋香烟等，確屬事實，因款撥下時物價已漲，與原預算相差甚遠，追加又甚困難，故購物以　補不足，購物乃為公家打算，並非私人岡利。總之，本人做事操之過急，未按手續，不過想以全力完成己願負責之事屬實，私人圖利之心從未有過。</p>
<p>現此案已辯論終結，待審判評議後，卽定期宣判。</p>
<p>畜牧塲短少馬匹</p>
<p>另外兩個貧汚案，也是建設廳屬下的。其一為陶瓷廠廠長沙吾克，曾拖欠今年一至七月份工資連省幣二億八千七百一十餘萬元（折合法幣為十四億三千五百五十餘萬元），沙吾克之弟色阿洪經提款省幣一億，交技士色都拉赴鄯善購買原料，僅運到白石四千斤，而單據毫無，並在南極後街私設玻璃廠一處，廠內原料什物多係公物，沙吾克並購有黃金十九兩，日前經建設廳查覺後，沙吾克已畏罪潛逃。</p>
<p>建設應所屬焉耆牧塲塲長帕吐拉，貪汚舞弊之事實，經建廳調查發現者，計短少馬卅三匹，羊一百隻，並經用公款省幣一千二百六十二萬一千七百元，該帕吐拉現已押解來迪，移送地院審訊法辦</p>
<p>出納員　揮金如土</p>
<p>院檢察處自動檢舉的案件，過去在迪尚屬少見，最近有教育廳出納主任馬壽祥，以一普通公務員，每日揮金如土，引起地檢處的注意，經初步調查，　確有貪汚舞弊鰍搬，查巳出並獲得充分緣據之利用公款舞弊載，已達省幣二十億（合法幣一百億）元之多，當卽提出檢舉，除將馬籌　於日前拘揮外，現正繼續偵查，準備提起公訴。</p>

<p>交易未有做開，陷入停頓狀態中，因粉廠直按配售予零售商，批發商無貨供應，致市上無開出，連次貨難牌粉亦無開出。鈇皮以限價開出一千三百包。</p>
<p>雜糧</p>
<p>繼續堅挺，黃豆供應稀少，車豆廠方去化，略有成交，徐州新黃豆十三元五角開出，苞米北帮吸納甚殷，已一致升達限度。紅糧供少，亦挺二角，蠶豆平定，元麥出口復活，去化活絡，挺升二三角。茶豆未有交易，芝蔴仍站原價，生仁提莊貨仍按限價成交。</p>
<p>食油</p>
<p>市勢回降，豆油及生菜油各降一元，因存貨限令登記，現貨吐出者甚多，收市價為四十九元五角，廠方未開，生菜油四十六元，亦降一元。生油及小車蔴油因貨稀而尚見平定，豆餅大統開六百片，價四元六角。</p>
<h3>糖市轉疲</h3>
<p>糖市昨日因開放出境流言吿吹，人心依然軟弱，本街納胃轉稀，客帮以運銷不通，停止吸市，市上籌碼頓充，行情逐步下游。二十期台赤棧單開後卽小，收市益見軟弱，中砂粗砂吐售較多，趨勢尤疲，其餘如車白精赤高等均被帶小，各檔較上日平均下跌五角至八九角。</p>
<h3>茶市做開不多</h3>
<p>昨日茶市，續呈交稀價挺之局，良以買戶雖仍接踵而來，但執主終因產價激昂，一味扳守，不忍輕脫，是以雙方談判之結果，大都依然陷於僵擯，做開卒告遜落。至其趨勢，在此情形中，又再迂迴帶秀，脚地揂無岌岌可危之象。</p>
<p>茲悉：目前海外對於華茶，注視不衰，惜國內生產成本巍站，難以順利配合輸出，致最近出口數量，已告銳减。惟聞若干華商出口行，為積極展開外銷，建立國際市塲，雖無利可圖，仍擬絡繹推銷，照此情形，洋莊茶市，尚無疲落局面。</p>
<h3>收兌限期轉瞬即屆金銀外幣持兌又湧</h3>
<p>近日因收兌金銀外幣限期，轉瞬卽屆，市民繳兌者，又趨擁擠。茲據國行業務局息，廿三日本市收兌總數為黃金三五六七〇，六〇八兩，白銀一九二〇一，八九兩，銀元九四，〇九九元，銀角雙毫一一〇，六四九角，美鈔七八三，六六九元，港幣一四七，一九〇，七六元，以上五項共兌出金元一〇，六四三，四三五，八四元。</p>
<h3>日本歸還物資中銅鎳幣業已到滬</h3>
<p>由國行及中信局接收</p>
<p>招商局海遼輪本月二十一日下午由佐世保載運戰時被日軍刦去之首批銅鎳幣一千八百餘噸返滬，停泊張華浜碼頭。廿三日傍晚由張華浜移泊黃浦碼頭，廿四日上午八時開始起卸。行政院日本賠償及歸還物資督運委員會駐滬代表辦公處特派負前往主持，並將該項銅鎳幣交由中央銀行及中央信託局會同接收。</p>
<h3>行莊申報外滙　應由董事長等負責</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕頃自央行獲悉：該行奉行政院電示，銀行公司行號申報金鈔外匯，應規定由各該銀行公司行號之董事長常務董事至少二人，及總經理共同簽名蓋章，連帶負責。</p>
<p>又訊：外商銀行外匯之申報，正加緊辦理中，僅少數尚未申報，且申報之外商行莊，巳陸續移存，如黃金及外幣，均已存入中央銀行，外傳困難之說，決非事實。</p>
<h3>華商汽車行要求與外商同等待遇</h3>
<p>政院經管會依加強經濟管制辦法，訂定第七八兩季輸入限額，在五六兩季原有之汽車卡東項目，已予删除，惟外商申請進口之上項車輛，得另案辦理，致引起華商汽車業之不滿。以為政府縱容外商輸入，而禁止華商進口汽軍，不但消耗外匯，且亦違背節約本旨，本市汽車商業同業公會，頃已代表素有汽車進口資格之華商會負汽車商行，具呈行政院經濟管制委員會，及節約指導委員會，要求與外商獲得同等待遇</p>
<h3>繅絲業公會議决　維持秋繭限價</h3>
<p>並以生絲供應絲織業</p>
<p>蘇浙滬區繅絲工業同業公會，於日前假座香港路銀行公會俱樂部，召集理監事聯席會議，由理事長陳藹士主席，討論本屆秋繭收購事宜。當以蘇浙兩省秋繭業已登塲，本月廿日接四聯總處代電停辦秋繭貸款，現已由各絲廠商，向商業行莊洽貸款項，租行收繭，並由蘇浙兩省政府遵照蠶絲產銷計劃綱要，規定標準，鮮繭價每市擔八十元。惟據產繭各地報告，以游資競收，致繭價哄　，他出政府規定，尤以無錫為甚。該公會為遵守政府法令起見，經葉決：</p>
<p>（一）由該公會通知各會員廠，務必恪　政府規定　價收購。（二）函請有關機關，切實取締業外人（卽業　　商）收購，以免乾面成為囤積對象。（三）分呈有關部院及四聯總處，請求對於廠商所收乾兩，辦理　押貸款，以期資金靈活，並將所繅秋絲，按照原定辦法繼續收購，統籌外銷，俾政府得以把握出口物資，爭取外匯。</p>
<p>再該公會為遵守政府新經濟措施，並顧念絲織業之原料起見，經一致議決，由公會通知各會員廠，對於所存生絲，除應繳解政府收購者，及合於外銷者外，應按照八月十九日市價，配售絲織業，以示互助。並授權常務理事會，就各會員廠之車位及產量等，統籌配售各　廠云。</p>
<h3>呢羢實銷發動</h3>
<p>近因天氣轉凉，添製寒衣者衆，毛織品呢羢實銷皆已發動。男女衣料，中西服裝，營業均盛，南京杭州諸客戶，來申添辦者亦絡譯不絕。最合顧客胃口者，係中厚嗶嘰及藏靑華達呢，及二十餘元起至四十元止之大衣呢。</p>
<h3>人絲市況平靜</h3>
<p>人絲交易淸淡，絲織乘因有配貨，納　轉　，絲號門鎖，去路仍暢，市况平中帶堅。執主售意甚懈，買戶進意亦淡，人心似甚平靜，一二〇號天橋依限價略有做開。</p>
<h3>現棉交易淸稀</h3>
<p>昨日現棉交易仍稀，因各地來源不旺，到少存稀，執主不願輕脫，紗廠納胃鬆懈，成交寥露。鄭州花成交三七包，沙市一三六包，價為一四一元，一四〇元，周浦籽花三〇元零八角，好起六角。</p>
<h3>推銷國營事業股票國行擬定三項辦法</h3>
<p>國營事業股票，中央銀行正積極設法補救中。據該行主管透露，國營事葉股票，正謀打開銷路。已決定三項辦法：（一）國營事業各單位之資產負債，趕速造報，分別印發，以便投資人之選擇。（二）保證投資人之利益，提高股息。（三）改訂股息支付辦法，以增加投資人之興趣。過去一年付息一次，現擬改分三個月付息。（四）增加發售地區，分期普及各大都市。</p>
<h3>紗市明平暗堅　棉布囤戶出籠步跌頗勁</h3>
<p>棉紗昨市走勢仍堅，粗細紗均登限度，本街納胃仍強，市况明平暗堅。四十二支細紗供售不多，做開亦少，價登限度，四十支卅二支照限成交，市况無榮辱。廿一支雙馬申新開售七七〇圓，塲內成交七八〇圓，價與上日相同。廿支除紅魁星雙鯉九華等稍離限度外，其餘均照限價，十六支十支各級升三·五圓。</p>
<p>布市深受商品登記之影響，昨展開猛烈跌風，蓋登記後之倉庫存貨，勢將受更嚴　管制，囤戶心虛，相率先行吐售，浮空復來肆虐，致跌風四起。</p>
<p>龍頭細布自廿七元四角步退，於十時一刻許最低廿五元六角有成交，四君子元嗶嘰自廿七元三角，退至廿六元九角，五福及喇叭童細布俱喊廿四元賣出，供多求少，喊價如秋風落葉，步降不已。</p>
<p>歸以浮空有獲利抵補，賣風稍戢，且外埠貨價俏俐，如登記商品之舉，僅以調查存貨數量為目標，一則舉辦出口證，轉有早日實施之可能，人心稍定。龍頭細布回升至廿六元六角收市。較上日挫一元四角，五福細布後回升至廿四元六角，終挫一元，喇叭童跌一元二角，四君子元嗶嘰最低做廿六元九角，最後為廿七元五角，餘多帶挫，交易激增，全市成交額計二千一百六十疋。</p>

<h3>郝更生暢談　英美體育觀感　世界體育趨向提倡體育娛樂</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕中華全國體育協社會總幹事郝更生此次出席世運會及考察英美體育歸來，於前日返抵上海，郝氏昨日下午四時特在市體育館招待本市各報社記者，發表在英美考察所得，述其觀感印象甚詳。茲摘要如下：</p>
<p>英國沉着認真</p>
<p>此次出國二月，在英美各約有一個月之勾留，考察所得，深覺體育為教育重要之一環，而與整個國家政治社會經濟俱有關聯。英國之體育，充分表現其沉着認眞不誇張之民族性與作風。世運會亦然如此。其組織與宣傳佈置等等，雖不及上屆柏林世運會之偉大，然其成功之點，未可抹殺。因英國國家經濟之困難，體育界亦在共渡難關，充份利用學校校具及簡單之運動器具，以供兒童之體育娛樂活動。學校體設備，相當完全，對兒童之體育活動，尤為特別注意。在此食物相當困難之時，兒童之營養，仍充份供給。在世運會開會期間，各處其他體育活動，並不稍為停止。在一星期六假日，出外遠足者，竟有四十萬人之鉅，其對體育娛樂之重視有如此。其對體育師資，尤為注重，其口號有：「好的體育制度固然重要，好的師資更為重要」。其對業餘與職業體育之分野，極為明顯。體育界對職業體育並不贊同，但亦承認其有存在之價值</p>
<p>美國豪華富麗</p>
<p>在美國方面，曾參觀紐約波士頓華盛頓芝加哥觀金山各地之體育設設施。美國方面所表現者，與英國大相逕庭，為豪華富麗之體育，體育經費之充裕，各學校體育設備之週全，社會體育活動之普遍，人材之衆多，決非吾人夢想所及。芝加哥市政府甚至有娛樂局之設立，專門管理提倡市民之娛樂體育，其規模之偉大，能自設廠製造體育用具。曾參觀一哥爾夫球棍工廠，工人有六百人之多，其分廠全國有八個，專門製造球棍而已。各地臨時游泳池之建立，以木板油布糊紙搭成，放水成池，拆搭極便，允稱體育上之新構。職業體育在美，尤為發達，惟對業餘炎格，仍限制極嚴。今日戰後世界體育之新趨勢，為將體育活動，成為體育娛樂。今日美國大學體育系中，並有娛樂系之設置，以培養娛樂體育工作之人才。美國此種努力之結果，為（一）增進身心之康健，（二）充實生活趣味，（三）增加工作效率，（四）提高人民道德，（五）减少都市罪惡。而其體育學術學理上之研究進步，亦非他人所能望其項背，對世界體育之貢獻，至深且鉅。</p>
<p>我國體育</p>
<p>由於此次考察所得，深覺我國體育採長補短，擇善而從，下列四點，尤急不容緩：（一）確立全國體育經費，（二）積極培養體育人材，（三）奠定學校體育基礎，（四）設立體育學術研究機構。中國體育，庶幾右望</p>

<h3>小型足球聯賽　今日甲組三塲</h3>
<p>小型足球聯賽甲組，今日有三塲，於下午三時起在昌平路晋元公園舉行，門票普售金圓五角，首幕鐵路對龍頭，雙方勢均力敵，按龍頭俱屬龍傑舊部，鐵路以精悍凶猛稱，屆時相逢，劇戰難免。第二三幕則由靑白兄弟兵，分戰康隊與怡光，靑白靑集中名手，康隊係上屆市長盃亞軍，今日兩雄乍逢，必出全力相爭。靑白隊健兒，於今日下午一時半，在許文奎寓所集合出發。今日秩序列左</p>

<h3>公開綱球雙打　今日重決冠軍　下午三時半陶王再戰葉蔡</h3>
<p>公開網球最後一幕，男子雙打陶冠球王文正對葉觀雄蔡國基，本星期三因雨未賽畢，陶王組以七比五，四比二領前，經裁判員林實華徵得雙方同意，巳賽成績取消，改今日下午三時半，在靑年網球會重賽，以決公開賽最後一個錦標。此兩對雙打，無疑為本季中最堅強之組合，陶王雖以常勝不敗稱雄有年，此次似難穩操勝券，今日門票一律售一元，前次觀衆可憑票根進塲，持有參觀贈券而日前已被收回注銷者，可在門首簽名蒞塲參觀。</p>
<h3>美籃球隊出征遠東</h3>

<h3>我世運代表團　海外捐款數目</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕關於中國世運代表團捐款，據郝更生昨告記者稱：菲律賓方面共得八千美金，新加坡方面亦八千美金，印尼則因荷蘭政府禁止鉅款匯往倫敦，結果無法取得。赴南洋接洽時，共僅用去二百元，速飛機票七百餘元。其夫人高梓女士赴英，乃奉行政院命令出席世界體育娛樂會議，規定費用由政府所贈二萬五千美金中開支。住倫敦旅館，一一人每日僅二鎊餘，稱不上為高貴，世運選手住宿舍中。亦日需二十先令云云。</p>
<h3>保險盃乒乓賽　定下週一奪標</h3>
<p>本市保險界同仁進修會主辦之保險盃團體乒乓錦標賽，參加者共十五隊，經兩月餘角逐，以呆人，聯合，太安鹽三隊成績最佳，各以十二戰全勝，造成鼎足之勢。呆人隊實力最強冠軍呼聲亦最高，惟該隊以志在表演，不願計分，自動放棄奪標權利。主辦當局為結束最後一仗起見，於昨晚召開競賽幹事會議，決議：（一）定九月廿七日下午七時，假仁記路外灘中國銀行四樓大禮堂決賽，（二）函請羅北辰給獎，（三）函請陳霖笙李龍標沈柏鴻三君担任裁判，（四）函請三屆乒乓聯賽甲組三強華美，精武紅，聯星甲，及全運女乒乓冠軍梁玉傑，及上海女子乒乓冠軍蔡秀娛等，參加表演助興，（五）不售門票，歡迎保險界同人蒞塲參觀，（六）呆人除放棄決賽，　讓　風，另　榮譽冠軍銀盃</p>

<h3>郁達夫的遺囑</h3>
<p>— 老丹</p>
<p>遭難三年祭</p>
<p>郁達夫在南洋遭難，屈指至今，整整的三年了·雖然他的遭難正確的日子，沒有方法查得出，有說是九月廿五，也有說是八月廿八，亦有說是九月十八，沒有一定。總之，是在日本向聯合國投降不久的日子，以時計之，是三年了。</p>
<p>在三年的過去期間，達夫的全集，至今還沒有人去整理出版，只有鄭子瑜編的「達夫詩詞集」出版，這小小的詩詞集，不特所收的詩詞不多，卽達夫的毀家詩十九首也沒有收入，加以錯誤的字又多，編者又把自己的作品附印，做了一條尾巴，弄得不三不四。雖然這樣，而達夫逝世後的遺作，也僅有此一小冊的詩詞流傳，文人身後的悽凉落寞，可見一般。</p>
<p>達夫有些什麽遺產呢？這是許多關心達夫的人想知道的。他是在民國三十四年秋天遭難的。奇怪得很，他在那年的夏曆正月元且寫下一篇遺囑，不知是他眞是「每年歲首，例作遺言」的寫作，抑或一時感觸，知道生命飄忽，特先預寫遺囑。若果那些迷信的人們，便說他這張遺囑是讖言，開春寫好，秋間便歸西了。這些事，我們不必去研究它，茲把他那張遺囑全文錄後：</p>
<p>「余年已五十四歲，卽今死去，亦享中壽。天有不測風雲，每年歲首，例作遺言，以防萬一。</p>
<p>自改業經商以來，時將八載，所得盈餘，盡施之友人親屬之貧困者，故積貯無多。統計目前現金，約存二萬餘盾盾家中財產約值三萬餘盾，「丹戒賓」有住宅草舍一及地一方，長百二十五米達，寬二十五米達，共一萬四千餘盾。凡此等產菜及現款金銀器具等，當統由妻何麗有及子大雅與其弟或妹（尚未出生）分掌。紙廠及「齊家坡」股款等，因未定，故不算。</p>
<p>國內財產，有杭州官塲衖住宅一所，藏書五百萬卷，經此大亂，殊不知存否。國內尚有子三，飛，雲，均，雖無遺產，料已長大成人，地隔歡千里，欲問訊亦未由及也。余以筆名錄之著作，凡十餘種，迄今十餘年來，版稅一文未取，若有人代為向出版該書之上海北新書局交涉，則三子之在國內者，猶可得數萬元，然此乃未知之數，非確定財產，故不必肅。乙酉年元且。」</p>
<p>乙酉年元旦，卽卅四年的二月。遺囑所云經商八載，似非事實，因為他在太平洋戰事發生的第二年二月離開星加坡，在那年的秋間纔經商開辦趙預酒廠，到了卅四年二月，只有經商兩年多，所說八載，似是飾詞。若由國內到南洋起算，則有六年多。杭州官塲衖住宅，是指風雨茅廬而說。不過他說藏書五百萬卷的數字，恐有錯誤，因為五百萬卷書，佔地頗多。但從別一方面看，一代文人的遺產，僅有此區區，是亦大可傷慨了。</p>

<p>日前本談載有孝推先生「潤筆嚴話」一文，於潤筆之創始及自題潤例種稱，舉例賅博，讀之頗趣。按「潤筆」二字見於正史者，在隋書鄭譯傳中。傳云：「譯復爵沛國公，任上柱國，上令李德林立作詔書。高熲戲謂譯日「筆乾！」答曰「出為方牧，杖策言歸，不得一錢，何以潤筆」！上大笑。」筆乾則須潤，一戲一答，針鋒相對。當是後世據以為稱潤筆之所本。</p>
<p>酬人以錢，敬求法繪壘賓，往往請加上款。首其用有二：一求者仰慕大名，願與訂神交；二有了上款，不會被別人奪去或偷去，可以永久珍藏。但是過去警家中也有不肯加上款或如加上款須照潤加倍的。前者像張譽，後者像康有為是。推他們不肯加上款的用意，無非自覦甚高。我與你素不相識，豈司對阿貓阿狗亂稱仁兄大人或先生等！不知旣已賣字，又怎能顧到這許多？康有為因想出加上款照潤加倍的苛例來，以視限制，然他作法自斃，竟鬧出一大笑話來。</p>
<p>有某甲者，不知其出身，有的是錢，特請康有為寫字，幷請加上款。照潤付訖後，一天去取書件，見上款僅加某甲之字　　二字，其下一字沒有。於是他大怒，向康質問說：「你豈可直呼我字，不配！」說罷，怒氣冲冲地把康寫的　寶撕做片片，丟在地上。康從未經這侮辱，自然鬍鬚曉起，便把潤簽之資，向某甲頭上籌去，一時洋錢落地，可可噹噹地作盤旋舞，某甲不顧而出了！</p>
<p>家中也有不加上款須倍　的。虞山蕭退　氏工四號書，其篆體尤得古媚之趣，因是有些販賣書畫之流，特請他寫單欲書件，容易出貨，因為有了上款，人家非「不要」，卽要「殺價」。　氏知其然，因視為他們囤貨，特想出一不加上款須倍潤的辦法來。這是有位朋友告訴我的，未知確否。</p>
<p>潤單後附有標準圖尺的，有擅寫市招的唐駝。有個時期，海上大小市招到處可見到他的手筆。大概他鑒於那批老闆之流，人太疙癢，寫得稍大些要請重寫，寫得稍小些亦然。唐氏覺得不勝其煩，因在潤單後附有尺樣，訂定過若干寸每字潤筆須若干，好讓求者目定出一標準尺度來，但這到底是潤單中僅見的。</p>

<h3>胡君亞光爲我作白描小象見惠絕肖喜報以詩並題於象</h3>

<h3>報銷</h3>
<p>— 東方旣白</p>
<p>看了自由談老丹先生的「簽字蓋章」及尢墨君先生的「蓋章」兩文，我因而又想起了「報銷」這件事。</p>
<p>無論大小機關，把錢用掉之之後，照例要「造報銷」。借有借條，支有傳票，領取者須蓋章，虧欠者須立據，買東西必有發單，造報銷必有「單據貼存簿」。不但數字相符，而且鑿鑿有據。眉目淸楚，一絲不亂。看似無懈可擊，也確實耗了事務先生不少精力，然而這一套百分之百的官樣文章，徒增麻煩，毫無意義</p>
<p>「造報銷」必需個中老手，呈上去一「核」就「准」。如果直言不諱，開誠佈公的報上去，百不一爽是碰釘子。輕則斥責一番，重則受罰記過，甚至打碎飯盌。有許多「辦公事」的先生，提起了造報銷就頭痛，殆非無因</p>
<p>個中老手，「老」在何處？曰：老於造假。</p>
<p>在老手的抽屜中，商店戳記，私人岡章，大小方圓，無不齊備。在報銷中需要何種單據，卽可馬上趕製應用。省事省時，價目高低無不從心所欲。如有未足，則預將所需單據寫好，持往商家情商，請其蓋章，亦不留難，蓋商家也無不洞悉此道也。這是公開的秘密。</p>
<p>造「報銷」必須符合「預算」，若有更動，便屬非法。紙張文具預算若干，造報銷時亦必須若干，郵電費預算若干，造報銷時亦必須若干，不能多亦不能少，恰恰及時而盡。一本厚厚報銷册子，全是造的假帳，早已成爲極普通的事。呈上去，「上面」也明知是假，却決不追究。有時或以數字不符被「打回頭」重造，直至相符乃止，這簡直就等於「上面」逼令「下面」造假。此風由來已久，人人習以為常，從未見有人懷疑，不滿，或抗議。</p>
<p>凡公出人員之出差費本有硬性規定，但有的於出差完畢尚須造報銷。某月某日，吃飯花若干，坐車花若干，亦必一一檢證呈核·出差者也無不有證有據，不多不少，恰符規定數字。呈報者全是造假，主管人亦知而不問。</p>
<p>所謂「官樣文章」，我看沒有比「造報銷」這件事再「官樣」的了。上下欺騙而不以為怪，浪費紙張，簽墨，精力，與時間，來一套「呈核」與「批准」的公文旅行，這究竟有何好處！更有何意味？</p>
<p>我是堅決主張徹底剷除這種報銷主義的。</p>
<h3>東鱗西爪</h3>
<p>— 咸斯</p>
<p>德國極度紙荒，在柏林的居民如果想得到一本新的電話簿，除須將舊電話簿繳還外，並須繳納廢紙（舊報紙舊書之類）十七磅。</p>
<p>紐約有一裝釘書籍的專家，此君對書的封面與內容之配合，極為注意，有一本書專講舵烏的，他在裝釘時就用鴕烏皮為封面。一本書專門講皮膚病，他就用人皮作為封面！</p>
<h3>角子機</h3>
<p>— 毛毅</p>
<p>「角子機」（Coin　machine）這樣東西對國人雖然相當生疏，但亦非完全陌生。戰前流通銅元的時候，上海街頭有一種「求籤機」，把銅元放進一個小洞口，在另一個洞口便會掉出一張籤紙來，這種玩意也可算是角子機的一種。今年夏天，上海有幾家冷飲店備有供應可口可樂的角子機，這可算是道地美國化的角子機了。</p>
<p>在今天的美國，角子機已成為美國人的生活的一部份。在戲院，旅館，車站，其他的公共塲所，甚至街頭道旁，都設有角子機，一個人祗要將角子投進去，便會落出來香烟，糖菓，橡皮糖，花生米，啤酒，郵票，和其他的日用品。有的角子機還供應冰塊，保險單，甚至會洗衣服。經營角子機的公司達二萬四千家之多，僱有職員二百萬人。</p>
<p>但是，這一切不過祗是一個開端罷了。現在有許多新奇的角子機正在計劃或製造之中。主婦將可向角子機買冰凍的食物。自動的大票兌換機將使人們不必再因沒有小鈔而煩惱。旅行者不但能够向角子機買車票，並且將能够同樣便利的買到刀片，甚至角子機還能够用自動擦鞋器替他擦皮鞋呢！</p>
<p>雖然角子機被認為是一種近代的新發明，但是，它的眞正的起源實在可以遠溯到紀元前一二百年之間。倫敦的拜納特，烏德克勞夫特教授在翻譯「亞力山大英雄的靈魂學」一書的時候，發現這位著書的埃及巧匠早已製造過原始的角子機，他發明了一種祭器，誰投入五枚銀幣，那祭器便會噴出聖水來，這玩意兒倒也是冶宗教與商業於一爐。</p>
<h3>茅台與威司格</h3>
<p>— 陳詒先</p>
<p>貴州茅台酒聞名久矣，平生以不得一嘗為恨。勝利後，茅台忽充斥於市，購一瓶飲之，並不見佳，不如四川之棉竹大麯遠甚，以為徒有虛名。日前中秋節，有友人贈自昆明帶來茅台一瓶，開塞傾酒入杯，先有一股酒香撲鼻，嘗之微有苦味，少頃舌本回甘，則芳香馥郁，為他酒所不及，同時有北平友人送凉　一包，　深紅色，兩頭微尖，不甚大而核極小，顆顆無虫，卽以之過茅酒，酒旣香冽，棗則有鮮，脆，甜三美，蓋為北平之眞郎家園炎也。（郎家園在京西，以產棗著名。）水滸上吳用智取生辰網，卽以白酒加入蒙汗繫，及鮮棗一大瓢，麻醉楊志一班人，刦得金珠數祖，可見好酒與好棗之能引動人也。</p>
<p>昆明來友人言：「茅台邨在貴州仁懊縣，其地多山，以溪水造酒，與紹興之以鑑湖水製老酒相同，老酒非鑑湖水不好，茅台亦非山溪水不純厚也。昔日茅台老容有百數十年之久，做酒師傳以麥及他料配合入窖，必須滿足兩年，始開窖出售，兼以交通不便，不能行銷遠方，供過於求，陳酒愈積愈多，故茅台之名聞天下。自十餘年前朱毛率衆自江西之瑞金老巢突圍而出，由湖南，廣西，貴州，四川數省而至陝北，茅台正在其經過路綫中，所有老窖，皆被摧毀無遺。現在茅酒皆爲新窖所產，加以公路飛機帶出者多，求過於供，一窰酒有不到兩年卽開封者，所以現在茅台酒不能如以前之佳。我所送一瓶為老窖酒，在昆明市亦不易購得。」</p>
<p>中秋節後二日，（九月十九日）翠雲生兄邀飲於其愼利酒號，席為福建菜，酒為陳年咸司格。是日天氣極熱，不减伏天，每人面前一大玻璃杯，斟酒至四分之一，再以冰蘇打水或檸檬水鑲之。第一杯一口氣飲乾，徧體生凉，其酒之芳香不如茅台，而淸冽過之，是乃洋酒特長，因其酒已陳多年，故味純厚已極。是日同聚者，有周搜鵑，范烟橋，李祖夔，甘鏡先（非園老人之世兄），潘子欣，沈燮臣諸人，羣賢畢至，賓主盡東南之美，不覺頻頻舉杯，竟至大醉，蓋自七七後，十二年無此痛飲矣。威司格出於英之蘇格蘭，以麥製成，與茅台同，法之白蘭地以葡萄製，我國之老酒以糯米製，洋河大麯以高梁製，此數種酒所用之原料不同，而陳者皆佳，各有其特味。今年中秋節，在三天內得吃中外名酒兩種，不可不一記。</p>

<h3>Zhang Fuyun Visits the Hong Kong Governor: Discussing the Implementation of the Sino-British Economic Agreement</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Guangzhou, 24th] According to a Hong Kong dispatch: Zhang Fuyun visited the Hong Kong Governor on the 24th. The date for the exchange of documents for the Sino-Hong Kong agreement is expected to be next week, as the Hong Kong side completes all legislative procedures. The Kowloon Customs, responsible for implementation, has been extremely busy preparing in recent days. The Customs held a tea party on the 24th to welcome Zhang and listen to his instructions on anti-smuggling between China and Hong Kong.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Hong Kong, 24th] Zhang Fuyun, Director of the Customs Administration, who was sent to Hong Kong to negotiate the implementation of the Sino-British Economic Agreement with the local government, formally visited Hong Kong Governor Grantham's secretary, McDonald, on the morning of the 24th, accompanied by Guo Dehua, Special Envoy of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for Guangdong and Guangxi. The Governor hosted a banquet at noon at the Hong Kong Government House. Zhang's mission here is because, after our group implemented currency reform, it is urgently necessary to consult with the Hong Kong authorities to thoroughly implement the "practical measures" of the Sino-British Economic Agreement, in order to stop smuggling and other possible loopholes. Although the Sino-Hong Kong Economic Agreement was signed as early as January this year, with a valid period of only one year, it has been delayed until now because the Hong Kong Legislative Council has been slow to approve it.</p>
<h3>Regarding the Examination of Chinese Deposits: Hong Kong Authorities Say They Have Not Yet Been Contacted by Our Side</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Hong Kong, 23rd] Hong Kong's Acting Financial Secretary, Clark, and Director of Imports and Exports, Shimshwa, said at a press conference on the 23rd that they could not comment on rumors that the deposits of overseas Chinese in Hong Kong banks would be examined. They said that, as far as they knew, the Chinese government had not yet contacted the Hong Kong government about this matter. Shimshwa confirmed that the new regulations limiting the carrying of Gold Yuan into and out of Hong Kong were part of the Sino-British Financial Agreement of October 1947. Clark explained that the "Defense of a Financial" ordinance only approves 20 banks to operate Gold Yuan telegraphic transfer business. Other unapproved banks are regulated by banking regulations, which are also part of the Sino-British Agreement. Shimshwa said that the purpose of these two regulations is to help the Chinese government stabilize its currency. He said, "This is in the interest of both China and Hong Kong." He also said, "China should be a major supplier and trading country in the world market. Stability in China leads to prosperity, and prosperity in China leads to prosperity in Hong Kong."</p>
<h3>Li Liangrong Arrives in Fuzhou: Practicing Thrift and Declining Receptions</h3>

<h3>Shanghai and Wuhan Idle Capital Flows Southward: Guangzhou Management Office Asks the Ministry of Finance About Possible Restrictions on Bringing Cash South</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Guangzhou, 24th] There are limited remittance measures here, but the Guangdong Customs and the Gold Management Bureau have received orders from the Ministry of Finance that bringing Gold Yuan to Guangzhou from various places is not subject to restrictions, resulting in a large influx of idle capital from Shanghai and Wuhan flowing southward. The Guangzhou Management Office, in order to find a way to remedy this contradiction, has submitted a request to the Ministry of Finance, possibly to newly establish restrictions on bringing cash south.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Xiamen, 24th] Song Ziwen, Supervisor of Economic Control in the Guangdong Area, in order to tighten control over finance in South China, has specially dispatched Zhu Shengquan from Guangzhou via Hong Kong to Xiamen. His mission is to find ways to prevent the black market for foreign exchange and to step up supervision of the exchange of gold, silver, and foreign currency, as well as the transfer of foreign exchange assets of commercial firms to state-owned banks.</p>
<h3>Various Groups in Taiwan Organize War Comfort Delegation: Scheduled to Depart on the 27th</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Taipei, 24th] In order to show respect to the soldiers suppressing the rebellion, the people of Taiwan Province, as previously decided by the Provincial Assembly, have organized a war zone comfort delegation.

<h3>The Capital District Prosecutor's Office Interrogates Tao Qiming: Indictment Possible by the End of This Month</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 24th] In the case of leaking currency reform secrets, the Capital District Prosecutor's Office summoned Zhao Guanhou, acting chief secretary of the Ministry of Finance. At around 9:00 AM on the 24th, Tian Jihou, the prosecutor in charge of the case, issued a temporary warrant to question Tao Qiming at the detention center in the Baby Bridge District Court. First, he confronted him with Li Guolan's testimony in Shanghai. Then, he asked Tao why he did not take the train to Shanghai but suddenly changed to a plane, and how Xu Baiqi leaked the secret of the currency reform and the three-day closure of banks nationwide to him. Tao claimed that he did not know, and did not answer the point about taking the train. This was completely contrary to his testimony during the grueling interrogation at the Capital Police Department. He also claimed that he went to Shanghai to visit his mother and had no other intentions. The interrogation ended at 11:00 AM, and Tao Qiming was still detained. Chen Guang, chief secretary of the District Prosecutor's Office, told reporters, "We are actively investigating the case of Xu and Tao leaking currency reform secrets. We have now dispatched Prosecutor Chen Yun to Shanghai to investigate and question witnesses related to Tao's case. Once Prosecutor Chen returns to Beijing, if there is no other new evidence to be investigated, we may file an indictment by the end of this month and transfer it to the criminal court for public trial."</p>
<h3>Fierce Fighting Intensifies in Western Liaoning: Standoff in the Suburbs of Yixian City, Suizhong and Xingcheng in Danger, Changli Area in Eastern Hebei Becomes a Vacuum</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Shenyang, 24th] The flames of war are raging fiercely in Western Liaoning, gradually moving towards a main force battle. The battle for Yixian City on the banks of the Daling River has lasted for more than ten days. The defending troops have resisted bravely, and the bandits have not made further progress. The area around the station is the focus of the bandits' fierce attacks. The bandits have changed to using the Third Column, which crossed the river, to attack Yixian. The casualties at the station, Dakuai, and Zhengjiatun have been extremely heavy in recent days. On the 24th, they were still in a standoff in the suburbs. The original Ninth Column of bandits attacking Yixian has now been transferred to Suizhong and has begun to attack fiercely. The fighting is fierce. The Fourth Column of bandits is still besieging Yucheng with its main force. The fighting is most intense at Yingpu Xiaodianzi, four kilometers southwest of Yucheng. The battles in Xingcheng and Suizhong have entered a serious stage. Shahuosuo, between Yucheng and Suizhong, has fallen into the hands of the bandits, and Baimiaoyu is also occupied by the bandits. The Jinzhou Air Force flew over the area between Xingcheng and Suizhong all day on the 24th to assist in the battle.</p>
<p>According to Air Force reconnaissance reports: Transportation is frequent along the line from Meihekou, Siping, Xinlitun to Beizhen, mostly ammunition being transported to Western Liaoning.

<h3>The Situation in Southern Suiyuan Becomes Increasingly Tense: Fu Zuoyi Flew Back to Guisui Yesterday: Deployed Military Affairs and Returned to Beiping the Same Day</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Guisui, 24th] Amid increasing tensions in southern Suiyuan, Commander-in-Chief Fu Zuoyi flew from Beiping to Guisui at 10:00 AM on the 24th. After Fu descended, he immediately held a meeting with various leaders and deployed military affairs, returning to Beiping at 6:00 PM that afternoon. Parts of Nie's bandits' First, Sixth, and Second Columns have fled from western Hebei to Zuoyun and Youyu in northern Shanxi, intending to cooperate with the bandits' forces to invade Guisui and Baotou. The bandits' forces that have infiltrated southern Suiyuan continue to move deeper into the territory of Helin and Liangcheng, appearing to be advancing towards Suiyuan.</p>
<p>[Another Dispatch] It is reported that Fu Zuoyi arrived in Guisui for several hours, inspected troops and civilian self-defense forces, and gave a short and powerful speech. He said in a firm and forceful tone that the bandits' invasion this time was a good opportunity for us to annihilate them.

<p>[Our Newspaper, Tangshan, 24th] Tonight, bandit forces from Zhan Shoufang's 12th Military Sub-district were discovered in Shuangqiao Yeli, more than ten miles north of the Majiagou Mine in Kailuan.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Beijing, 24th] Yan Youwen, spokesman for the Bandit Suppression Headquarters, analyzed the war situation in North China at a press conference on the 24th, stating: (1) Nie Rongzhen's bandits' forces are being pursued and attacked frantically by the national army in North China and can no longer concentrate their main forces to fight, so they have adopted a method of dispersing and harassing. The national army has raised its alert to this. (2) One-third of Nie's main force has been eliminated, and about one-sixth has deserted or surrendered, accounting for half of the total strength.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Chengde, 24th] Since launching mobile suppression operations, the national army and local militia in Chengde have won consecutive victories.

<h3>Fighting Intensifies Around Jinan: Major Strongholds Are Still Firmly Defended by the National Army: Wang Shuming Flies to Jinan Again to Direct Operations from the Air</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Jinan, 24th] The war outside Jinan is becoming increasingly fierce. The Ninth and Thirteenth Columns of bandits on the southeastern outskirts, with about five regiments of troops, attacked Yonggumen yesterday under the cover of eight armored vehicles. The national army annihilated part of the bandits who broke in. The remnants of the bandits are still confronting us outside Yonggumen. Part of the Third Column of bandits in the southwest corner, under the cover of artillery fire, attempted to break into the city. The national army fought back bravely, and the bandits' momentum was slightly restrained. A small number of bandits harassed Hanshiqiao and Baotuquan. The commercial port has entered a state of mixed warfare. The bandits suffered heavy casualties, but they still used human wave tactics, not hesitating to make large sacrifices, using corpses as cover, and attacking the city fiercely. Major strongholds such as Qilu University, Qianfoshan Temple, and Ma'anshan are still firmly defended by the national army.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Jinan, 24th Afternoon] The bandits who are fighting fiercely with us around the Yonggumen city wall are repeatedly engaging in hand-to-hand combat. The battle is unprecedentedly fierce. The bandits have increased reinforcements from the Bohai, Ninth, Third, and Thirteenth Columns and continue to attack the outer city at the risk of their lives. The national army repeatedly charged and killed countless bandits. The outer city fortifications were lost and regained four times within ten hours last night and this morning. At this moment, the bandits and we are fiercely fighting near the southeastern gate of the city. It is estimated that from the 15th to the 23rd, nearly 50,000 bandit troops were killed or wounded in the Jinan periphery, and we also suffered more than 17,000 casualties.</p>

<h3>Full Text of Foreign Minister Wang’s Speech at the Paris United Nations General Assembly</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Paris, 24th] Foreign Minister Wang Shijie delivered a speech at the United Nations General Assembly on the 24th. The full text is as follows:</p>
<p>Before speaking, I would first like to express, on behalf of my delegation, our gratitude for France’s gracious hospitality. Whether in terms of material comfort or spiritual inspiration, it is hard to find a place as suitable for our deliberations as Paris. France has made great contributions to the evolution of mankind, and the world is still in dire need of such contributions. The wise people of France, with their exceptional abilities, can certainly shoulder this responsibility. The members of the Chinese delegation are very pleased to be in France.</p>
<p>From the perspective of an Asian country representative, I acknowledge that the United Nations has made considerable progress compared to the former League of Nations in representing the peoples of the Far East and in actively addressing various issues in this vast region. However, I must frankly state that the representation of Asia and the Far East in the Security Council and the Economic and Social Council is still insufficient. Within these two bodies, China’s voice is the sole voice of the nations east of the Suez. In the past year, I have been pleased to observe that many issues in the Asian Far East region have received fair attention in the various organs of the United Nations. The issues to which I have paid particular attention include the independence of Korea, the dispute in the Dutch East Indies, and the work of the Economic Commission for Asia and the Far East. Mr. Chairman, regarding these issues, I would like to express China’s satisfaction with the good work that has been done. Given that the India and Pakistan Mediation Committee is just beginning its important task, I do not wish to comment. India and Pakistan are both friends and neighbors of China, and major members of the Security Council. China deeply hopes that the difficulties between the two sides can be resolved through the assistance of the United Nations, in a spirit of reconciliation, and that the friendship between the two countries can be enhanced.</p>
<p>Independence of Korea</p>
<p>(1) Regarding the issue of Korean independence, this General Assembly should continue to pay attention to the independence of Korea. The difficult work of the United Nations Commission on Korea is made even more difficult by the unwillingness of the Soviet occupation forces in North Korea to cooperate. However, the delegation has completed the free and democratic elections in South Korea under such uncooperative circumstances, making a significant contribution. Regardless of the various opinions on the former Japanese colonial rule in Korea, one thing can be asserted: that the regime did not make every effort to prepare Koreans for an independent and democratic life. The general elections in South Korea this spring were the first opportunity for Koreans to express their wishes for the destiny of their country. On May 10, election day, over ninety percent of registered voters went to the polls. There is no doubt that the Korean people have expressed their desire and readiness for freedom and autonomy. The judgment of the United Nations Commission on Korea itself is extremely fair and authoritative regarding the final results of the election. I am particularly pleased with the following passage from the report submitted by the Secretary-General of the United Nations to this General Assembly on the Korean issue:</p>
<p>On June 25, 1948, the United Nations Commission on Korea decided to reiterate its opinion as follows: The elections of May 10, 1948, were a valid expression of the free will of the electorate in the areas of Korea accessible to the Commission, which constituted about two-thirds of the population of Korea.</p>
<p>After the May 10 election, the Korean people established their provisional government, which the Chinese government believes should be granted de facto recognition. We are pleased to note that the governments of the United States and the Philippines have also granted de facto recognition. However, the work of the United Nations Commission on Korea is not yet complete. The delegation’s assistance efforts have not extended to North Korea, and the delegation has not been able to send observers to the area north of the 38th parallel. Korea is still a divided Korea. The future of Korea is of great importance to the peace and prosperity of the Far East and the world. The Korean people, with their long culture, their habits of diligence and thrift, and their unanimous dedication to peace, should not only gain independence and unification, but, after independence and unification, they should also be able to contribute to the stability of the Far East. I urge the General Assembly not to relax its efforts on the issue of Korean independence. We must move forward so that the Korean people can achieve complete unification and independence. The Chinese government will do its best to cooperate with other member states to achieve this goal. We have no ambition in Korea. The more solid and prosperous Korea's independence is, the better it will be for China.</p>
<p>The Indonesian Question</p>
<p>(2) Regarding the Indonesian question, I believe that the Security Council and its Mediation Committee deserve the gratitude of the United Nations for their handling of the Indonesian question. We have prevented war and have worked together to maintain a ceasefire without major unfortunate incidents occurring. We have also paved the way for a final settlement between the Dutch government and the Indonesian Republic government. The Dutch and Indonesian sides have agreed to form a joint organization on an equal footing. Mr. Chairman, I would like to express my congratulations on the agreement reached by both parties on this great principle. In implementing the Renville Agreement, serious difficulties have arisen, mainly in procedural matters. The Mediation Committee’s insistence on inflexible regulations has exacerbated the difficulties. I do not wish to overlook future difficulties, but I cannot imagine that any leader on either side would allow procedural issues to prevent the realization of the goal of freedom and democracy. I would like to make two more observations on this matter. Her Majesty Queen Wilhelmina of the Netherlands told the people of the world years ago that colonialism had ended. Her Majesty’s words accurately summarized the spirit of this era. I dare to add a note here: the aspirations of nations seeking freedom must be recognized by all countries in the world. Only by recognizing the right of self-determination of all nations can we hope that nationalism will not become abnormal and exaggerated, or become anti-international. This also forms my second observation. We, the Chinese people, are pleased that Indonesia will achieve its political goals. I hope that Indonesia's political freedom will be followed by orderly progress, which will be encouraged by its spirit of cooperation with its neighbors and distant friends, especially with the Netherlands, because there must remain many common relationships between the Netherlands and Indonesia (continued on page 3)</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Looking to the North at the Flames of War!</h3>
<p>The main battle in the Jinan area, which the whole country is watching, has been going on for nine days now! The communist bandits are adopting "human wave tactics," relying on their concentrated forces to advance towards the urban area step by step. Our defending commander, General Wang Yaowu, though his forces are less than a third of the bandit army, is in high morale and continues to hold the core area, fighting to the death, determined to coexist with Jinan City. This manifestation of "determination to fight to the death" is truly moving to Heaven and earth. Considering the overall war situation, the gains and losses of one city or one place need not be overemphasized. However, Jinan is strategically located between the two major strongholds of Tianjin and Xuzhou, and is also the junction of the Tianjin-Pukou and Jiaoji Railways. It can be said to control the throat of our country's north-south transportation, making it a must-contend place for military strategists. Precisely because of this, the gains and losses of Jinan are not comparable to ordinary towns. This is also why the whole country is paying close attention to the development of the Jinan battle. As the Shandong legislators stated in their petition to the President: "Jinan is not only Jinan of Shandong, but is actually closely related to Xuzhou and the capital. In any case, the government should do its best to ensure its safety."</p>
<p>Although we also advocate that the central government should quickly send troops to aid and defend this historically famous city and important town, we believe that the military authorities should see through the communist bandits' "autumn offensive." They should make an overall plan for the battles in the Northeast, North China, and the Jinan area, and should not treat the symptoms without addressing the root cause, sending elite troops east and west, tiring themselves out, or falling for the communist bandits' trick of attacking in the east while striking in the west. This time, the communist bandits have gathered a large army of no less than 300,000 men to attack the Jinan area, willing to bet everything, seemingly determined to take Jinan. However, we believe that the purpose of the communist bandits' entire battle plan is not entirely in Jinan, and their greatest ambition is in the Northeast and North China. Military observers generally say that the communist bandits' "autumn offensive" is not only military, but also political, and even economic.</p>
<p>Now is the time when autumn crops are ripe and new grains are harvested. This year, the Northeast and North China are uniquely blessed by the heavens, with favorable weather, which can be called "a year of great harvest." In the vast fields, there is now a scene of "tall sorghum, fragrant soybeans." This is a great temptation for the communist bandits. Our side has long used troops to protect and assist farmers in "quick harvesting, quick transportation, quick threshing, and quick storage" in various places. This is like a thorn in the back for the communist bandits, forcing them to launch the "autumn offensive" in advance. The communist bandits not only want to protect their own autumn harvest, but also want to destroy the national army's autumn harvest. The sufficiency of military rations is often a key factor in determining victory or defeat. Moreover, the communist bandits' purpose in creating chaos is to create economic panic in the country in order to drag down the National Government and realize their ambition to seize power. In the past three years, after each large-scale battle, the communist bandits may not have achieved much militarily, but they have ultimately considered it a great gain to stimulate rising prices in the government-controlled areas. Now that the government has implemented currency reform and achieved initial success, not only have prices stabilized, but also people's hearts are at ease. The communist bandits will naturally launch a military offensive to create unrest and panic in the government-controlled areas. This is the real purpose of the communist bandits' autumn offensive. Some say that the communist bandits' offensive is to strike at the "gold yuan," which also seems to be an insightful comment.</p>
<p>Looking to the north at the flames of war, the communist bandits' "autumn offensive" began on the 11th of this month in western Liaoning, attempting to disrupt the Jin-Yu railway traffic. Then, the Luan-Dong war broke out again, and the communist bandits occupied Changli on the 14th. The Jinan battle became tense on the 17th. Today marks half a month, and its purpose and ambition have long been exposed. In the Northeast, the communist bandits first seek to isolate Jinzhou, and then attempt to occupy Shenyang and Changchun without a fight, swallowing the entire Northeast. In North China, the communist bandits are starting from Luan-Dong, and the Shunyi-Sanhe battle is an attempt to threaten Peiping and Tianjin. In Shandong, they believe that occupying Jinan can prevent the national army from reinforcing North China. In this way, they are using military means to achieve their political ambitions. Mao Zedong once said that after the "autumn offensive," he could choose a place in North China to convene a "new political consultative conference" and organize a "North China People's Government." This is excellent proof. As for why the communist bandits are so eager to "succeed"? This question can only be explained from the international situation. Communist forces are steadily advancing towards Western Europe. The inability to resolve the Berlin crisis shows the tension between the Soviet Union and Western democracies. But the Soviet Union also wants to take advantage of the fact that Western countries are focusing on Europe and attempt to take action in Asia at the same time. Southeast Asia has already begun to move, but the key to Asia is China. If the CCP "succeeds" (?), Southeast Asia can proceed smoothly without any more problems. The New York World Journal has long pointed out the communist bandits' conspiracy in its comments on the Far East situation, which can be said to be insightful.</p>
<p>In short, we first ask the military authorities to quickly formulate a major plan, immediately change from passive to active in military affairs, and crush the communist bandits' "autumn offensive." Secondly, we hope that the people in the rear will concentrate their will, practice thrift and build the country, and resolutely support the government's economic reform plan. Even if the communist bandits' "autumn offensive" has some achievements militarily, and there are some gains and losses in one city or one place, we should still maintain our faith, not waver, and not disturb ourselves, so that the communist bandits cannot achieve their political and economic goals in this "autumn offensive"!</p>

<h3>Expand Trade with Japan and Open Cash Sales; Principles Approved by the Trade with Japan Association</h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent, Nanjing, 24th] The Trade with Japan Guidance Committee held a meeting at the Ministry of Industry and Commerce at 3:00 p.m. on the 24th. More than 10 representatives from various relevant ministries and commissions attended the meeting, presided over by Vice Minister Tong Jiling. In addition to approving the list of private business representatives to Japan for the fourth batch, they also discussed the expansion of the trade with Japan system and the opening of cash sales. In principle, it has been approved that trade with Japan will adopt both barter and cash sales systems in the future. However, detailed specific measures have been decided. Relevant agencies are limited to submit written opinions before the 29th, and then the Ministry of Industry and Commerce will organize them and make a final decision. The opening of the cash system for trade with Japan is due to the fact that the Allied Headquarters has approved Japan to trade with China in cash and has made suggestions to China on opening the cash system. It was submitted to the Trade with Japan Guidance Committee for discussion on the 24th and was approved in principle. In the future, Japan needs to order goods and commodities from China and can trade in cash. However, in order to save foreign exchange, China will try to adopt a barter system for the Japanese materials and goods purchased. The scope of cash trade with Japan will still be limited to the categories of barter trade. State-owned export commodities such as tung oil, bristles, and mineral sand will still be handled by the China Trust Bureau and will not be included in the scope of private trade. Cash trade with Japan will be calculated in US dollars, and import and export licenses will be issued in accordance with regulations, and will still be subject to import quota restrictions. In addition, it was decided that private business representatives to Japan will be sent every three months.</p>

<h3>Korean, Greek, and Veto Issues: The Soviet Union Again Requests Removal from the Agenda; Representatives of Various Countries at the United Nations General Assembly Call for Peace</h3>
<p>[News Agency Report] Paris, 24th - Broadcast: During this morning's session of the United Nations General Assembly, the representative of Uruguay spoke first, urging the UNGA to concentrate greater efforts on establishing international law and order. The representative of South Africa spoke, criticizing the United Nations for failing to adhere to the spirit of the Charter and warned the United Nations not to interfere in the internal affairs of other countries; otherwise, South Africa would withdraw from the United Nations. The representative of Denmark pointed out that the German refugees on its border endangered its security, and then the Chairman, Evatt, announced a recess. Chinese Foreign Minister Wang and the representative of Myanmar also attended and delivered speeches.</p>
<p>Another dispatch: Following yesterday's failure in the General Committee, the Soviet representative Malik today reiterated his request in the General Assembly, stating that three types of issues should not be included on the agenda: the veto power for admitting new members, the issues of Greece and Korea, and the accusation against the Soviet Union for violating human rights. Malik stated that discussing such issues would not benefit the United Nations in any way and would inevitably lead the United Nations to repeat the mistakes of the former League of Nations.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Paris, 24th] The United Nations General Assembly on the 24th heard a call to declare war illegal. The call was issued by the Chief Representative of Myanmar, Maung Hla, and in fact, this is a revival of the Briand-Kellogg Pact (French Foreign Minister and US Secretary of State) after the First World War, but the pact has long since died a natural death. Maung Hla requested that the current General Assembly should first discuss ways to safeguard world peace. "We should first pass a resolution reiterating the principles of the preamble to the United Nations Charter, namely that the member states are attending the third session of the UNGA with the sincere hope for peace and will never go to war with other countries under any circumstances." When the General Assembly began at 10:45 AM, the representatives of 58 countries were trembling due to the threat of war. It is generally believed that the Soviet Union will soon issue two important documents, which may determine the long-term history of the UNGA and the world. These two are the policy speech of the Soviet Chief Representative Vyshinsky and the Soviet reply to the Western powers' new note on the Berlin crisis. If the Kremlin's reply is unsatisfactory, and Vyshinsky once again launches into a tirade, then the hope of improving the international situation will vanish.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 23rd] A total of six people spoke at the UNGA on the 23rd. The most important was US Secretary of State Marshall, whose firm and moderate tone won general sympathy. The other speakers all firmly maintained that the most important task of the United Nations was to permanently banish the monster of war, and they outlined their concepts of a just world political structure in different ways. The Syrian representative, Khoury, said that he advocated opening the doors of the United Nations wide to accommodate all sovereign states and hoped that the General Assembly could overcome the obstacles placed by the Security Council in this regard. The Venezuelan representative expressed extreme regret at the decline of political morality in the post-war world, saying that this only revived past animosities and discrimination. The Egyptian representative mentioned the Palestine issue, questioning the transplantation of hundreds of thousands of foreign people to Palestine as masters of the holy land, and the impact of this will threaten the security of the entire world.</p>
<h3>Marshall and Bevin Meet; Reach Agreement on the Next Steps Regarding the Berlin Issue; Smith Summoned Back to Washington for Consultations</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Paris, 24th] US Secretary of State Marshall met with British Foreign Secretary Bevin again on the 24th to discuss the Berlin crisis. This was their first meeting since Bevin returned to London to attend an emergency meeting and then returned here. In London, Bevin made a foreign policy statement in the House of Commons, saying that if the Berlin airlift still had to be maintained in the winter, the three Western powers were in complete agreement on the next steps. Marshall and Bevin met in the morning, so Marshall was late for the UNGA meeting. British and American envoys Smith and Robertson, who presided over the Moscow talks, were also present at the meeting between the British and American foreign ministers, which is noteworthy.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Paris, 23rd] British representative Shawcross's response to reporters' inquiries showed that if the three powers were still dissatisfied with the Soviet Union's reply, they intended to submit the Berlin issue to the United Nations.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 23rd] US Ambassador to the Soviet Union Smith flew to Washington tonight, seemingly to report the situation of the Moscow talks to Acting Secretary of State Lovett and Secretary of Defense Forrestal, or perhaps to meet with Dewey and other key Republicans.</p>
<h3>Moscow Radio Criticizes Marshall's Speech</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, London, 24th] Moscow Radio on the 24th attacked Marshall's speech at the UNGA, believing it was deliberately intended to influence the US elections in November. The broadcast stated, "The US State Department hopes to dazzle American voters with a rosy diplomatic policy, but the essence of this policy cannot deceive anyone." The broadcast also criticized the Filipino representative's appeal as "completely hypocritical, because the Philippine delegation is merely a faithful executor of Washington's policies and has no independent action to speak of."</p>
<h3>Balkan Committee Report Submitted to the UNGA</h3>
<p>Yugoslav Pressure on Greece Decreases</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Washington, 23rd] The State Department released a report on the 23rd, for the first time suggesting that after Prime Minister Tito's break with the Cominform, the pressure on Greece from the communists may have decreased. The State Department also released the report of the United Nations Special Committee on the Balkans, which stated that in recent months, the evidence of the Greek guerrillas receiving assistance from Yugoslavia has also decreased. This report covers the period from June 17 to September 10 and will be submitted to the UNGA. The report also recommends that the United Nations issue a serious warning to Albania, Bulgaria, and Yugoslavia that if they continue to assist the Greek guerrillas, it will endanger the peace of the Balkans.</p>
<h3>General Committee Continues to Meet; Main Agenda of the General Assembly Agreed Upon; Issues of the Holy Land and Italian Colonies Included</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 23rd] The United Nations General Committee agreed on the agenda of the General Assembly this afternoon, which includes the former Italian colonies, Palestine, the establishment of a United Nations guard force, and smaller issues such as human rights and freedom of information. After the decision, the initial study of each item on the agenda was completed, and the work was distributed to the six standing committees according to the nature of which committee should handle each item. With the exception of human rights and freedom of information, the General Committee refused to establish any new committees. The General Committee completed its work very quickly today, clearing the way for constructive work.</p>
<h3>British Defense Minister Announces Troop Strength Plan</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, London, 3rd] British Secretary of War Shinwell told the House of Commons on the 23rd that the United Kingdom, the United States, and the Western European alliance countries are conducting discussions on defense and strategy. Secretary of Defense Alexander reported that due to "unrest, riots, and disturbances around the world," the government is prepared to immediately establish British armed forces.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, London, 23rd] British Secretary of Defense Alexander declared in the House of Commons today that as a result of the British government delaying demobilization, it would be able to maintain a troop strength of 825,000 on January 1 next year, which will be reduced to 790,000 on April 1, otherwise it would be 716,000. The government may recall some reservists to active duty, and the general mobilization plan is currently under preparation. He also stated that the production of jet fighters, armored materials, and automatic weapons will be doubled. This plan was actually prompted by the current situation and was not caused by panic.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, London, 23rd] Officials announced that the government has decided to increase the number of naval reservists from 14,000 to 75,000, in addition to the 17,000 reservists who have already joined the Royal Fleet.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Canberra, 23rd] Australia has recently accepted a mission to develop Australia into the main supply base in the Pacific under the British United Kingdom defense plan.</p>
<h3>After Indonesian Government Forces Launched an Offensive, Fierce Fighting Near the Outskirts of Madiun; The Communist Rebellion in Blitar City Has Been Suppressed</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Batavia, 24th] According to the Indonesian Republic's official news agency, Antara, on the 24th: Nologaten, 98 miles west of Madiun City, fell back into the hands of the communists after fierce fighting. The fighting is fierce in various regions. Republic troops and military police have suppressed the communist rebellion in Blitar City, east of Madiun City, after breaking the resistance of the Social Youth Army.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Batavia, 23rd] The Indonesian Republic, which was facing a civil war shortly after its establishment, launched a three-pronged pincer attack on the 23rd, advancing towards Madiun City, which was occupied by the Communist Party. According to Radio Yogyakarta, fierce fighting has broken out near Kertan, 12 miles southwest of Madiun City. The Antara news agency first revealed that the communists had occupied Kertan. According to Radio Yogyakarta and the Antara news agency: The Republic's offensive is going smoothly. The Mospit Airport, nine miles outside Madiun City, is in the hands of the Republic's troops. Fighting at the airport on the outskirts of Madiun City is still ongoing. The Communist Party, which launched a counter-offensive in the important transportation town of Natjek, has stalled due to the disarmament of many Communist Youth Army members. Amid the Republic's troops' advance on Madiun City, the Madiun City Communist Radio Station announced that martial law has been imposed in the communist area. At the same time, Radio Yogyakarta stated that the Communist Party had blown up the bridge west of Madiun City to impede the government's offensive. The radio also claimed that the Commander-in-Chief of the Republic's troops was confident of "liberating Madiun City in the earliest possible time." It is reported that ten senior Indonesian military officers have been removed from their positions for allegedly being involved in another communist coup.</p>
<h3>Sjahrir Denounces the Indonesian Republic</h3>
<p>Urging People to Support the Communist Struggle</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Madiun, 23rd] Former Indonesian Prime Minister Sjahrir broadcast on the Madiun Communist Radio Station tonight, saying: "The Indonesian Democratic Army will never be intimidated by the reactionary Republican government and is prepared to respond with force." According to Sjahrir, who is currently the Minister of Defense of the Communist government, he denounced the Republican government for abandoning the Indonesian people with its "appeasement policy." Sjahrir called on all Indonesian people to support the "people's struggle" under the leadership of the Communist Party.

<h3>Full Text of Foreign Minister Wang's Speech at the United Nations General Assembly in Paris</h3>
<p>Economic Work in Asia</p>
<p>〔Continued from Page One〕(3) Economic Commission for Asia and the Far East. I would like to offer a few observations regarding the work of the Economic Commission for Asia and the Far East. Among the countless subsidiary bodies of the United Nations, the Economic Commission for Asia and the Far East, under the Economic and Social Council, holds a unique and prominent position. This is because its task is to promote the economic progress of half the human population in Asia and the Far East. Mr. Chairman, I personally and my government dare to say that our neighbors all aspire to the benefits of modern science and technology. Poverty is a significant issue in Asia and the Far East. If there is a war worth fighting in the world, it must be the war against scarcity. The primary responsibility for economic progress in Asia and the Far East naturally rests with the governments and peoples of the region. However, industrially advanced countries can provide substantial assistance. Mr. Chairman, I do not intend to elaborate on the economic problems of Asia and the Far East during this general debate in the General Assembly. Instead, I wish to take this opportunity to state the guiding principles for addressing such a problem. We hope that economic development in Asia can be accelerated through international cooperation, but we believe that external countries must not interfere with the socio-economic systems that nations voluntarily accept and develop. There is no pre-fabricated social system anywhere in the world that can be directly imported into Asia. We now reserve our own rights and will fight to preserve the right to develop a social system that meets our needs and the ideals of our social justice. The Economic Commission for Asia and the Far East has held three meetings. We believe that the work of the Commission, in essence, is progressing gradually. The Commission must first collect data, but we hope that it will not become an academic institution. The Commission must hold meetings and adopt resolutions, and we hope that the resolutions will not become mere formalities. At its recent meeting in India, the Economic Commission for Asia and the Far East recommended the establishment of a Flood Control Bureau. The Economic and Social Council, recognizing the extreme importance and urgency of the flood control issue that affects the lives of millions of people in the major river basins of Asia and the Far East, has also approved its establishment. I am delighted by this. In this important area of economic improvement, any constructive, centralized, and cooperative effort will immediately gain the attention and support of the people of Asia. We therefore hope that this work will begin as soon as possible. This type of work could serve as a good example of the United Nations promoting constructive cooperation in administrative matters.</p>
<p>Economic and Social Progress</p>
<p>(4) Economic and Social Council. In reviewing the work of the regional commissions of the Economic and Social Council, I would like to briefly describe the general progress of the Economic and Social Council itself. Regarding the Economic and Social Council's multifaceted activities, I would particularly like to emphasize two of its courageous endeavors. One is to eliminate international trade barriers, and the other is to promote freedom of world news. Both of these efforts have achieved significant success. One has already signed an agreement, and one has established a draft. Although China's economic development and domestic political situation have not progressed and stabilized as hoped, its firm determination to support such constructive efforts by the United Nations has never lagged behind others. Mr. Chairman, the Chinese delegation believes that in order to promote the work of the Economic and Social Council, member states must always be prepared to place their own national considerations below the needs of international cooperation.</p>
<p>The Veto Issue</p>
<p>(5) The Veto Issue. The Chinese delegation is pleased to note that the Standing Committee, which the General Assembly instructed at its last session to study the veto issue, has submitted a well-researched and completed report. In this regard, the United Nations General Assembly should consider the recommendations of the Standing Committee. The Standing Committee has listed several possible resolutions of the Council that it believes are undoubtedly procedural in nature. Therefore, they should not be subject to the veto. It has also listed several matters that it believes are less related to politics. Therefore, if the permanent members of the Security Council can agree, they can be placed outside the scope of the unanimity rule. The Committee has also suggested regulations that it believes the permanent members of the Security Council should normally adhere to when using the veto. Some of these measures recommended by the Standing Committee appear to be very helpful in resolving difficult issues. The Chinese government believes that the veto power stipulated in the United Nations Charter is intended to ensure that every substantive decision made by the Security Council has the highest degree of authority. The main purpose of stipulating the veto is to enhance the prestige of the United Nations, not to diminish it. However, if the veto is abused, the main organs of the United Nations may fall into paralysis. Therefore, the permanent members of the Security Council should be cautious in exercising the veto and should respect the reasonable interpretations of the provisions of the United Nations Charter, which may impose restrictions on the scope of the power's use.</p>
<p>Universal Peace</p>
<p>(6) The Issue of Universal Peace. Before concluding this speech, I would like to say a few words about the issue of universal peace. Maintaining peace is clearly not something that can be accomplished by a single effort or a single institution. War and peace are constituted by multifaceted forces on many fronts. This issue is as old as history. Politics, economics, and strategy have all had a significant impact on it. In China's recorded history of three thousand years, there have been various experiences with the issues of war and peace. China has sometimes been a victorious conqueror and has also sometimes been conquered by other nations. However, in our long experience, we have never committed the crime of imposing our own ideas on others. We have always allowed other peoples to maintain their religious customs and their economic and political systems. If other nations recognize the value of Chinese culture and wish to adopt it, we welcome them. However, we have never intended to impose this way of life on others. Mr. Chairman, the main reason I raise this issue is that one of the main points of the peace issue we face today is the conflict of such ideas. Perhaps, except for the period of the Thirty Years' War in Europe, I cannot recall a time in history when the relations between countries were so complex and intricate due to ideological conflicts as they are today. In general discussions about this conflict, there is a misconception that the people of the world must choose between communism and capitalism. In fact, there are other possibilities. For example, China believes in the principles of what the founder of the Republic of China called the Principle of People's Livelihood, which is different from both communism and capitalism. For any country to impose an idea on another country in any way is an impossible and dangerous thing. We must relearn in the mid-twentieth century what the people of Europe learned in the mid-seventeenth century, namely, tolerance. Differences between churches still exist, and there are various genuine branches that people can evaluate according to their own thinking. However, civilized society has recognized that people can worship their God in different ways. No matter who believes in what religion in their own way, they must also respect the religious customs of others. What Europeans learned about religion at the cost of the Thirty Years' War, we should also learn about economic and social systems without going through a Thirty Years' War. This does not mean that the world cannot have a common belief. In fact, we must uphold the basic idea of the United Nations Charter, in which we should all believe. We should all have faith in this. However, apart from this, we must all practice tolerance. If world peace is to be maintained, the current ideological war must be replaced by tolerance. At the same time, we should make every effort to strengthen the authority of the United Nations, whose constitution we have solemnly accepted and signed. Mr. Chairman, I would like to state one more point here. If any member of the Security Council, especially a permanent member, begins to feel satisfied with a weak United Nations, then at that moment, this country is already disloyal to world peace or to itself. I said at the Second General Assembly of the United Nations that the United Nations had reached a stage where its future development, or even its existence, was precarious. The situation in the past year has not alleviated our anxiety. If anything, it can be said that the current situation seems even more serious than a year ago. Today, as we gather, the major aspects of the world situation are not better than they were in 1939. Therefore, our responsibility to uphold world peace is heavier and more urgent than at the last meeting. Only if we are more tolerant of each other and thoroughly understand our responsibilities under the Charter can we hope that all nations will one day be truly united. China's determination and contribution to this great task will never lag behind others. (End)</p>

<h3>Wang Chunzhe, the First Person Executed for Disrupting Financial Order, Was Shot Yesterday; Suicide Note Accuses Zheng Jiayu of Going Scot-Free</h3>
<p>〔Reported by This Newspaper〕Wang Chunzhe, manager of the Lin Wang Company, the first person to be severely punished for the crime of disrupting financial order, was executed by a special criminal court yesterday.</p>
<p>After being sentenced to capital punishment by the Special Criminal Court on September 3 of this year, Wang Chunzhe applied to the Central Special Criminal Court in the capital for a retrial. On the 22nd, the Central Court ruled to uphold the death sentence. On the 23rd, a special envoy arrived in Shanghai to deliver the judgment and execution order to the Special Court in this city. The main text of the judgment reads: "The original judgment regarding Wang Chunzhe is revoked. Wang Chunzhe is sentenced to death for jointly and continuously intending to disrupt the financial order for the purpose of harming the suppression of rebellion, and is sentenced to deprivation of civil rights for life. The parts of the judgment concerning Lin Tongshi and Zheng Ligong, which found them not guilty, are approved." The Special Court brought Wang from the detention center at 1:30 PM yesterday. Wang's face was pale, and he wore a finely checkered gauze short shirt and pants, and yellow leather shoes. Seeing the heavily armed guards, he knew his death was near, but his attitude remained calm. He was first taken to the waiting room. At 1:40 PM, Prosecutor Li Yulong took the bench and ordered Wang to be brought to the court. He first asked about Wang's age and place of birth. Wang said, "I am 36 years old and from Shantou, Guangdong." Prosecutor Li then informed him that the Central Special Criminal Court had sentenced him to death and ordered his execution. He asked, "Do you have any last words?" Wang immediately shouted that he was unjustly killed, and that all black market gold and foreign exchange transactions were done by Zheng Jiayu, who is abroad and unaware of the situation.</p>
<h3>Advising His Old Mother Not to Resent His Cousin</h3>
<p>He then asked for paper and pen and wrote two suicide notes. One was addressed to his mother: "Mother: Don't grieve when you hear that I have been executed. Life is but a few decades, and everyone must die eventually. However, my death is too unjust. The main culprit is actually my cousin, Zheng Jiayu. He took my cash and is going scot-free. Tell him to commit suicide as soon as possible to atone for his sins and avoid harming others. As for my property in Shanghai, please ask my nephew Kai and my second brother to settle it and give it all to you. My eldest sister and younger brothers have been running around in Shanghai for my sake, and I am sincerely grateful. But my fate is such that it cannot be reversed by human effort. Finally, what I want to tell the world is that I have no regrets even in death, because I have not wronged the country or any individual. Only the country has wronged me. My efforts to export foreign exchange to the country have not been recognized at all. The things that others have done, the crimes they have committed, have all been put on my shoulders. At most, I was just negligent in using people.</p>
<p>Please also ask my nephew Kai to comfort all my girlfriends and ask them not to be sad. There are plenty of good men in the world. I wish you good health. Your unfilial son, Chunzhe."</p>
<h3>Entrusting His Nephew to Console His Girlfriends</h3>
<p>The other note was addressed to his nephew Wang Zhongkai: "Kai: Please settle my property and give 10,000 gold yuan to Ya Ling (note: his girlfriend; Wang was not married). I wish you success in your studies. Zhe." After writing the notes, he prepared for execution. Wang requested an anesthetic injection, but Prosecutor Li told him that there was no such equipment and gave him a bowl of sorghum liquor. Wang drank it all. At 2:10 PM, he was taken to the execution ground behind the Shanghai Prison, where he was shot. The bullet entered the back of his head and exited from the right side of his nose.</p>
<h3>His Nephew Rushed to Claim the Body and Prepare for the Funeral</h3>
<p>Afterwards, Wang's nephew Zhongkai heard the news and rushed to the scene (Zhongkai is a junior in the Department of Business Administration at the National Shanghai College of Commerce). He called the International Funeral Home, and the body was taken away around 5 PM.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Alumni Association of the National Assembly, after electing its new officers at the beginning of this month, has been actively developing its affairs and is scheduled to hold its first meeting of officers at 2:30 PM today at the Council Chamber on Tangzhan Road to elect standing officers and group leaders, and to discuss other important matters.</p>
<h3>Chiang Ching-kuo Invites Representatives from the Industrial Sector to Discuss Maintaining Price Controls with Increased Production as the Prerequisite; Expresses Approval for Their Support of the Policy</h3>
<p>〔Reported by This Newspaper〕Supervisor Chiang Ching-kuo invited representatives from the labor sector in this city for a discussion at 10 AM yesterday. Those invited and present included Shui Xiangyun, Zhou Xuexiang, Ye Xianggao, Liang Yongzhang, Fan Caiqui, Chen Boliang, Fang Rusheng, Zhao Shuqing, Zhu Shanyuan, Su Zhijian, and more than ten others, accompanied by Director Wu of the Social Affairs Bureau. Supervisor Chiang first delivered a speech, praising the workers as the true producers of society. He stated that maintaining price controls currently requires increased production as a prerequisite, and that only through cooperation between labor and management can production be increased. He expressed his satisfaction that the price control policy has received strong support from the labor sector, and he believes that once the currency stabilizes, the workers' problems can be resolved reasonably and appropriately. After Chiang's speech, the representatives present spoke enthusiastically. Their main points can be summarized as follows: (1) They hoped to abolish the discount on the cost of living index when calculating wages. (2) The raw material problem in the factories of this city is serious. The number of workers unemployed due to the lack of raw materials has exceeded two thousand. The knitting industry is suffering from the impact on production due to the lack of supply of 32-count cotton yarn. The cotton textile industry also feels the difficulty of insufficient raw materials. The silk weaving industry has an irrational allocation of raw materials, with those who need them not being allocated and those who do not need them being over-allocated, which needs to be improved. (3) Freezing workers' income according to the August 19th price controls is clearly detrimental to the workers, and they ask the authorities to pay attention to this fact. (4) The most threatening factor to the lives of workers at present is the rising price of vegetables, which is difficult to report one by one. Supervisor Chiang at the time gave a sincere reply to the opinions of the representatives, stating that "Under the August 19th price controls, some people are indeed suffering, but the price control policy itself is not wrong. Fortunately, this is currently a transitional period, and many problems will eventually have a reasonable solution in the future. If there are any changes at present, it is feared that it will affect the whole situation." The discussion ended at 12:30 PM.</p>
<h3>Measures to Adjust Industrial Raw Material Supply Are Likely Being Discussed; Yu Hongjun, Dai Yu, Qing Wen, Zi Hongjun, etc. Hosted a Banquet for Leaders of the Industrial and Financial Sectors Yesterday</h3>
<p>〔Reported by This Newspaper〕Yu Hongjun, Chiang Ching-kuo, and Liu Gongyun jointly hosted a large-scale banquet at the Central Bank at 7 PM last night for leading figures from the industrial and financial sectors in this city. Xu Jiqing, Li Ming, Du Yuesheng, Wu Yunxu, Jie Yunzhang, Liu Hongsheng, Jin Runxiang, Hu Xiyuan, Liu Ji, Pan Shihao, Hu Boxiang, Hong Nianzu, Yang Guanbei, Wang Qiyu, and others attended. Mayor Wu, Director Wu, and heads of various institutions of the Material Supply Bureau and the Transportation Control Commission were also invited to attend. The discussions during the banquet focused on the future supply of industrial raw materials in this city. The hosts and guests agreed that Shanghai is a manufacturing center and needs to absorb industrial raw materials from various places. At present, the prices of raw materials in other places are higher than in Shanghai. In the future, the management agencies will formulate all practical measures to adjust raw materials to maintain the smooth progress of industrial production in this city. To strengthen efficiency, the various industry associations will closely liaise to strengthen the joint allocation and sale of raw materials and the joint sale of finished products from various factories.</p>
<h3>No Suspension of Work or Reduction of Work Allowed</h3>
<p>Supervisor Chiang also stated on the spot that, in order to increase production, factories must not suspend work or reduce work without reason. The industrial figures present at the time replied that wages would be paid as usual during the period of work suspension or reduction, so factories would never intentionally suspend work or reduce work. The phenomenon of work reduction and suspension has its objective reasons and needs the assistance of the management authorities to resolve it. The banquet ended around 10 PM.</p>
<h3>Encouraging Party Member Vendors to Set an Example</h3>
<p>〔Reported by This Newspaper〕Supervisor Chiang Ching-kuo stated that the recent crackdown on black markets and inspection of hoarding has achieved some results, but the supply situation in vegetable markets, which are closely related to people's livelihood, is still not ideal. Therefore, he took the opportunity of the Kuomintang Municipal Party Headquarters convening a discussion with cadres from the sixteen district party headquarters the other day, and specially visited the Municipal Party Headquarters to sincerely inquire about the current trading situation of over two hundred party member vendors in the egg, oil, chicken, meat, vegetable, and fish and seafood industries. Fang Zhi, chairman of the Municipal Party Headquarters, and Xie Renzhao, secretary-general, were also present.</p>
<p>Vendors from Various Industries Complained One After Another</p>
<p>Meat vendors stated that the wholesale price of pork was previously 4.8 yuan per catty, but has recently increased to 5.5 yuan. If sold at the controlled price of 7.2 yuan per catty, there is actually little profit because the wholesale price includes pig heads, skin, and bones. Therefore, they hoped to reasonably reduce the wholesale price. Egg vendors stated that the recent shortage of chicken eggs is due to cold storage companies collecting them for export sales. Therefore, they are currently only supplying more duck eggs, but they still hope that the authorities will find ways to open up sources of supply. Vegetable vendors also stated the difficulty of limited profits due to transportation costs and other reasons.</p>
<p>Resolving Various Difficulties</p>
<p>Supervisor Chiang immediately stated that he would find ways to help resolve the various difficulties faced by vendors. If wholesalers do not comply with the wholesale price and try their best to supply, they will be severely punished. However, the price controls of August 19th must be strictly adhered to, and supplies must be maximized. In particular, he hoped that party member vendors would set an example and have a demonstration effect, so that the daily lives of the general public would not be affected. Finally, Supervisor Chiang mentioned that when he inspected the various vegetable markets, he saw a lot of fish and shrimp, but very few buyers. When he asked the vendors the reason, he was told that it was because the controlled prices were too high. Chiang said that he would further investigate this and decide on appropriate measures.</p>

<h3>Merchants Be Warned: Wang Chunzhe Expressed His Hope That Merchants Would Be Alerted When Facing Execution</h3>
<p>〔Reported by This Newspaper〕After writing two suicide notes, Wang Chunzhe turned to the surrounding news reporters and told them that the main culprit in this case was actually his cousin, Zheng Jiayu. He himself had only recently returned from the United States and was renting a room at No. 832, Youth Association Dormitory, Eight Immortals Bridge. He was 36 years old and not yet married, while Zheng Jiayu had fled to Hong Kong and was going scot-free. Because he was the manager, he could not escape responsibility. He hoped that all merchants would be alerted by his legal punishment and repent and reform. If so, he would feel that his death was worthwhile.</p>
<h3>Taichang Leather Store Reported for Exceeding the Price Limit by 40%</h3>
<p>〔Reported by This Newspaper〕Yesterday, a certain person in the shoe industry went to the Taichang Leather Store on Beihai Road to purchase square-cut courtyard leather and discovered that the leather price was about 40% higher than the August 19th price limit. Although the price originally written on the leather had been erased, the traces were still discernible. He immediately reported to the police on duty, who took a clerk from the store, along with twenty-five pieces of square-cut leather that had been increased in price, to the Lao Zha Police Bureau. The bureau's economic section questioned the price increase and detained him, and will summon the owner of the store to be questioned and dealt with. According to the informant, since the authorities implemented price limits, the raw materials for shoe production have become difficult to obtain. For example, rubber soles are rarely sold on the market. He earnestly hopes that the management authorities will pay attention to this as soon as possible.</p>
<h3>Fuchang Flour Mill: A Large Quantity of Stored Flour Was Seized</h3>
<p>〔Reported by This Newspaper〕The Fuyuan Flour Mill at No. 701, Meian Road, Jiangwan Town, was reported for hoarding a large quantity of flour. Yesterday, the Economic Police Brigade of the Police Bureau sent personnel to thoroughly investigate and, as a result, seized eight thousand bags of flour in the factory, of which more than four thousand bags were miscellaneous brands of flour. Upon reviewing the factory's accounts, only seventy-nine bags of bent powder had been sold from the end of August to the 15th of this month. The amount of stored flour greatly exceeded the amount required for three months of business, indicating a suspicion of hoarding for speculation. The manager of the factory, Lu Zhongfeng, was taken to the bureau for interrogation.</p>
<h3>The Case of the Shooting of the Gold and Foreign Exchange Broker is Transferred to a Special Court for Trial</h3>
<p>〔Reported by This Newspaper〕The British national, Que Li A Que, who shot and killed gold and foreign exchange broker Yu Shengxiao, was sentenced to life imprisonment by the Shanghai Local Court on November 20, 1947, and sent to the Supreme Court for review. It is now learned that because the crime committed by the defendant Que Li A Que falls under Article 3, Paragraph 1, Item 7 of the Regulations for the Punishment of Bandits, it is a case that should be dealt with in accordance with Article 7 of the Emergency Criminal Punishment Ordinance for Endangering National Security During the Period of Suppression of Rebellion. Therefore, the Supreme Court has ruled to transfer it to the Shanghai Special Criminal Court for trial.</p>
<h3>Shandong Natives in Shanghai Appeal to Ensure Jinan</h3>

<h3>Suspicion of Black Market Gold and Dollar Transactions: Special Tribunal Interrogates Wei Boxiang; Claims Difference Between Head Office Fund Transfers and Loans; Two Foreign Nationals' Interrogation Postponed Due to Translator's Absence</h3>
<p>[Our Report] Wei Boxiang, a legally designated broker of the Central Bank, his wife Yao Daiying, Russian national Meiji, and French national Aiqier were interrogated by the Special Criminal Tribunal at 10:00 AM yesterday on suspicion of engaging in black market gold and dollar transactions. After Judge Jiang Shanchu took his seat, he first summoned Meiji and Aiqier, stating, "Due to the change of translators in this court, and the new translator not yet being in place, the questioning regarding your cases will be temporarily postponed today." Subsequently, Wei and his wife were summoned, and the seized account books were given to Wei to review. The account books were all written in English. After Wei explained, they included correspondence with various banks and commission accounts for buying and selling US dollars. The judge asked if there were any other account books besides these. Wei replied that there were none; the office was very simple, and detailed accounts could be checked with various banks. He further stated that he did not engage in black market gold and dollar transactions at all because his usual brokerage business already kept him too busy. For example, on August 24th alone, there were over forty transactions. The price of US dollars fluctuated every minute, with a market that required constant attention to telephone quotations, leaving no time for black market gold and dollar transactions. However, he admitted to temporarily providing funds for banks or between banks and clients when they were unable to transfer funds for US dollar transactions. Judge Jiang questioned him about whether he was also running an underground bank. Wei immediately denied this, saying that such temporary fund transfers were permissible in the brokerage business, only lasting one or two days, and were different in nature from loans. After the interrogation, Wei's wife stated that she was in poor health and requested bail. Judge Jiang instructed that they would be notified if bail was granted. All four were returned to custody.</p>
<h3>Eight Clerks Dismissed; Requesting Explanation from Ministry</h3>
<p>[Our Report] Xu Qiwu and eight other clerks from the District Procuratorate were collectively dismissed from their positions last month under an order from the Ministry of Judicial Administration. Subsequently, Xu and others separately submitted appeals to various central government agencies and courts across the country, urging them to uphold justice. However, to date, there has been no response from the Ministry of Judicial Administration. Xu and others hosted reporters yesterday afternoon, intending to release the materials they had collected to the newspapers as a means of appeal. Chief Prosecutor Zhang Yuquan of the District Procuratorate learned of this and dispatched Prosecutors Cao Hong and Lin Ye to persuade them. After discussions, Xu and others agreed to postpone the release of all the materials, but demanded that Chief Prosecutor Zhang immediately consult with the Ministry to explain the reasons for the dismissal, or to approve their reinstatement immediately. If reassignment was necessary, they requested that it be within the city.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Zhuang and Itinerant Merchants Must Report Materials</h3>

<h3>Police Officers from the Criminal Investigation Department on Trial for Corruption; Three Defendants Explain the Transfer of Funds; Manager of St. George's Hotel Absent, Hearing Adjourned</h3>
<p>[Our Report] The case of Shao Guanrong, Shao Liang, and Zhu Bingxi, police officers from the Criminal Investigation Department of the Municipal Police Bureau, accused of corruption, was heard yesterday afternoon by Judge Fang Xianghai of the Fourth Criminal Division of the District Court, with the three defendants brought from custody. Shao Guanrong stated that he was dispatched to western Shanghai and Pudong on September 4th to handle a case. When he returned home in the evening, his wife told him that Shao Liang had come to the house several times, leaving two taels of gold and 100 gold yuan, asking him to pass them on to Feng Xiushan, a clerk in the police bureau, without stating the purpose of the money. He did not know the plaintiff, Wu Gensheng, and Shao Liang was an old friend of many years. He knew nothing else.</p>
<p>Only Knew Repayment of Debt</p>
<p>Shao Liang (Public Relations Director of Tianfu Ding Nail Factory) stated that on the evening of September 3rd, Zhu Bingxi asked him if he had any close friends in the police bureau because his friend Wu Gensheng owed Feng Xiushan, a clerk in the police bureau, money and it was inconvenient for them to interact. He wanted Shao Liang to repay Feng on his behalf. Because he knew Shao Guanrong, he agreed, and visited Shao Guanrong's house several times on September 4th but did not find him. So he left two taels of gold and 100 gold yuan with Shao's wife, asking her to pass them on to Feng, only knowing that it was Wu Gensheng's repayment of Feng's debt, and knowing nothing else. Zhu Bingxi (Deputy Manager of Defeng Transportation Company) stated that he was sentenced to three months' imprisonment ten years ago for embezzlement and was an old friend of the plaintiff, Wu Gensheng. Wu had previously told him that Feng Qishan, the chief of the Criminal Investigation Section of the police bureau, was going to detain Wu in connection with a case. Wu feared being sued, so he entrusted Zhu, who was acquainted with Feng Qishan, to ask Feng Qishan if this was true. Feng Qishan replied that he did not know and instructed him to ask the police officer Feng Xiushan directly. Feng Xiushan said that it was true and that Wu Gensheng should know the reason for his detention. On September 2nd, Wu and a person named Mao came to the Yangzi Hotel to find Zhu, saying that he owed Xiushan old debts and entrusted Zhu to pass them on, but Zhu did not agree and asked Shao Liang to pass them on.</p>
<p>Arrested While Refusing</p>
<p>On September 4th, Wu called Zhu to meet at the Da Sanyuan Restaurant at 6:00 PM. At that time, Wu said that he owed Xiushan too much old debt, that the previous payment was insufficient, and still asked Zhu to pass on the remainder. Zhu was unwilling and was refusing when he was arrested by plainclothes police. At that time, Wu said to Zhu: "I invited you out to testify, it's not your business, you should tell the truth." The court asked: "Is it true that 500 gold yuan were found on your person when you were arrested?" Zhu replied: "No, the gold yuan were on the table, and I was refusing." At this point, because the plaintiff, Wu Gensheng, manager of the St. George's Garden Hotel, had not appeared in court, and the case was complicated, the court ordered an adjournment. The defendants' request for bail was denied, and they were returned to custody. The court adjourned at around 1:00 PM.</p>
<h3>Conspiracy to Sabotage Power Plant Case Re-Tried; Wang Xiaohe Still Sentenced to Death; Wu Guozhen Sentenced to Life Imprisonment; Remaining Sentences Upheld</h3>
<p>[Our Report from Nanjing, 24th] The Shanghai Special Criminal Tribunal sentenced Wang Xiaohe, Standing Director of the Industry Labor Union of the Shanghai Power Company, and Wu Guozhen, a worker at the Yangshupu Power Plant of the Power Company, after they were found guilty of conspiracy to sabotage the power plant on July 19th. The case was submitted to the Central Special Criminal Tribunal, which on the 24th upheld the original death sentence and permanent deprivation of civil rights for Wang Xiaohe. Wu Guozhen's original death sentence was commuted to life imprisonment and permanent deprivation of civil rights. The other defendants: Zhang Shibin, life imprisonment; Wu Shishen, two years' imprisonment; Tan Asi, one year and six months' imprisonment; Chen Longgen and Shi Zhonggen, one year's imprisonment; Huang Hongxun, exemption from punishment. All original sentences are upheld.</p>
<h3>Scarcity of Food Supplies; Urging Appreciation of Broken Rice</h3>
<p>[Our Report] The People's Food Distribution Committee stated that there were many misunderstandings from the outside regarding the delayed distribution of rice this month. The person in charge of the Distribution Office stated yesterday that the source of the current distribution is controlled by the Ministry of Food, and the People's Food Distribution Committee is only responsible for distribution. To expedite the delivery of rice to the hands of the citizens, the rice ships now go directly to the rice shops upon arrival at the port, without first going to the warehouse. The People's Food Distribution Committee has done its utmost. In addition, the outside world generally does not welcome broken rice. This is not due to poor selection, but because the import of rice from foreign countries requires that whole rice be paired with broken rice, and the price is the same. At a time when food supplies are difficult after the war, and comprehensive distribution in the Shanghai area has lasted for more than half a year, the Ministry of Food has also done its utmost. The *Wen* and the *Hai Huang*, *Chenggong* vessels arriving yesterday and today, respectively, also had a large proportion of broken rice. It is hoped that citizens, amid the current call for diligence and frugality, will remember that although rice grains may be whole or broken, they are hard-earned and should be cherished.</p>
<h3>First Step in Rationing Daily Necessities: Coal Briquettes First</h3>

<h3>Evidence of Criminal Behavior Conclusive; Extreme Punishment Imposed to Avert Others: Central Special Tribunal Judgment in Wang Chunzhe Case</h3>
<p>[Our Report] Wang Chunzhe's death sentence upheld and executed by firing squad. The original judgment of the Central Special Criminal Tribunal is extracted below: "The appellant Wang Chunzhe, in the 36th year of the Republic, partnered with Lin Mingjian to establish the Lin Wang Company. After the victory, it was renamed Lin Wang Trading Company at 131 Beijing Road, Shanghai. Wang Chunzhe, as the sole proprietor, served as manager and hired Zheng Jiayu as deputy manager. Wang Chunzhe also partnered with Wang Shenghe and Wang Shunan to open Liansheng Trading Company, located at the same address, also managed by Wang Chunzhe. These two businesses were affiliated with the Shantou Lin Wang Company (Wang Chunzhe as shareholder and deputy manager, Lin Mingjian as shareholder and manager). In Hong Kong, they entrusted Tai Kun Company, managed by Zheng Tingjiao, to handle business. They used the import and export of yarn, lace, and rubber as cover to engage in large-scale black market trading of gold, US dollars, and Hong Kong dollars, and used telegraphic transfers to conduct foreign exchange transactions. They kept separate accounts, using code names such as 'beans,' 'sugar,' 'rice,' 'noodles,' 'powder,' and 'you' to represent 'gold,' 'US dollars,' and 'Hong Kong dollars,' and using 'dan' to represent 'liang' for transactions.</p>
<p>Sufficient to Impact the Entire Country</p>
<p>The accounts show that from January 23rd to March 10th of the 37th year, the income from the purchase and sale of Hong Kong dollars and private Hong Kong exchange totaled HK$1,532,882.07, while the payments totaled HK$1,984,612.06. From January to April of the 37th year, a total of HK$350,303 was privately exchanged. From March 9th to 15th of the 37th year, the income from the purchase and sale of US dollars and foreign exchange totaled US$147,666.26. From March 9th to May 6th of the 37th year, the payments totaled US$150,295.26. From March 18th to April 26th of the 37th year, 196.895 taels of gold were bought and 196.544 taels were sold. 1,754 US dollars were exchanged for 30 taels of gold, and 10.325 taels of gold were exchanged for 557 US dollars. There were financial transactions with Shanghai's Ruikangcheng Exchange House, Datong Bank, and Datong Bank. The transaction area reached New York, San Francisco, London, Hong Kong, Shantou, which was a large-scale disruption of Shanghai's financial organization, sufficient to impact the national economy and lead to social unrest.</p>
<p>Original Judgment Not Unfounded</p>
<p>The original trial adopted the appellant's confession, and the Lin Wang Trading Company's accounts were found in the appellant's residence at the Huamao Hotel. After verification by the Financial Administration Bureau, it was confirmed that there were large-scale gold and dollar exchange activities under the names of Xiongji, Zheji, Yuji, Tai Kun, and Tongrong Lianfa, etc. Zheng Jiayu's letter to Wang Chunbo included the words: 'The Financial Administration Bureau is very strict with various investigations, and the communications between Hong Kong and Shanghai have all been changed to code words. The following is a record of the previous copy... Hong Kong exchange (You)... American (Sugar)...' Based on these facts, and considering the seriousness of the crime, the sentence of extreme punishment was imposed in accordance with Article 5, Paragraph 1, Item 10 of the Emergency Criminal Law for Endangering the State during the Period of Suppression of Rebellion, which is not unfounded.</p>
<p>Grounds for Appeal</p>
<p>The grounds for appeal and defense include the following: (1) The Emergency Criminal Law for Endangering the State during the Period of Suppression of Rebellion is political in nature, aimed at undermining the government. The defendant's responsibility for the black market trading of gold, foreign currency, and foreign exchange is merely a simple disruption of financial behavior, without the intention to undermine the work of suppressing rebellion. (2) The gold and foreign exchange trading was Zheng Jiayu's personal illegal act, and the appellant cannot be held responsible. (3) The appellant left the country on September 19th of the 36th year and returned to Shanghai on April 26th of the 37th year, so he could not have been involved in Zheng Jiayu's malfeasance.</p>
<p>Emergency Criminal Law Not Limited to Insurgents</p>
<p>This court holds that the Emergency Criminal Law for Endangering the State during the Period of Suppression of Rebellion is aimed at crimes that endanger the State's work of suppressing rebellion, but is not limited to punishing insurgents with political motives. Any behavior that meets the requirements of this law should be punished. Large-scale black market trading of gold, foreign currency, and foreign exchange is sufficient to disrupt the financial order, make the black market rampant, and greatly hinder the work of suppressing rebellion. Anyone with basic economic knowledge knows this. The appellant received higher education and engaged in import and export business, so he should have been more aware of this. Knowing that it was hindering the work of suppressing rebellion and still allowing it to happen means that he foresaw the occurrence, and its occurrence did not violate his original intention. Therefore, it is difficult to say that he had no intention of hindering the suppression of rebellion. Also, the appellant was the manager of Lin Wang Trading Company, and Zheng Jiayu was the deputy manager, so the appellant should be fully responsible for all business activities of the company. Furthermore, the gold and foreign exchange trading accounts were found in the appellant's private residence. Therefore, he cannot blame Zheng Jiayu's individual actions.</p>
<p>Returned from Hong Kong Long Ago</p>
<p>Furthermore, the appellant traveled abroad from September to November of last year, which is evidenced by his passport. However, he returned to the country from Hong Kong in December of the same year, which is evidenced by Lin Mingjian's letter to the appellant and the company's daily records of Wang Jingli's and Wang Chunzhe's accounts. Moreover, the company's operation of gold, US dollars, and foreign exchange continued until May 6th of this year, so it cannot be attributed to Zheng Jiayu's malfeasance. The empty statements of defense are insufficient to adopt. However, the appellant engaged in the gold, foreign currency, and foreign exchange business with general intent, committing the same crime repeatedly. The original judgment did not apply Article 56 of the Criminal Law, which is a mistake. Also, the appellant committed several crimes due to complex laws, and one law should be selected from the multiple laws. The original judgment mistakenly stated that violating Article 1 of the Regulations on the Punishment of Gold and Foreign Currency Trading and the Central Bank's Regulations on Foreign Exchange Control was merely a method of disrupting the financial order, and imposed a heavier penalty in accordance with Article 55 of the Criminal Law. This is also an error and should be revoked and amended. Considering the circumstances, the extreme punishment should still be imposed to deter others. September 22nd of the 37th year of the Republic of China, the First Division of the Central Special Criminal Tribunal, Presiding Judge Lou Guang, Judges Ye You Tang, Zhang Wen, Gong Cheng, Yin Rubiong."</p>

<h3>Yong An Warehouse in Hong Kong Burns for 32 Hours; Fire Extinguished; 115 Bodies Unearthed</h3>
<p>[Our Report from Guangzhou, 24th] The Hong Kong fire was extinguished at 4:00 PM on the 23rd. A total of 115 bodies have been unearthed. The Yong An Warehouse has not yet been excavated, and it is unknown how many bodies are inside.</p>
<p>[Our Report from Hong Kong via Airmail, 22nd] The Yong An Warehouse in Sai Wan, Hong Kong, caught fire at 8:00 AM on the 22nd. In the past month, there have been three warehouse fires in Hong Kong. In addition to the loss of 800,000 yuan worth of pharmaceuticals at the naval dockyard warehouse, the previous fire at the Kowloon Warehouse and this fire at the Yong An Warehouse have resulted in losses of over 10 million yuan, truly a "catastrophe" for Hong Kong merchants!</p>
<p>Spontaneous Explosion</p>
<p>The fire at the Yong An Warehouse was also caused by the spontaneous explosion of chemical substances due to the weather. The warehouse is located next to the tram line and is a four-story building converted from residential houses, four in a row. The upper floors are residential. Therefore, in addition to the loss of goods, there was also the tragedy of people being buried in the fire. The death toll was heavy, and the losses were huge, surpassing the fire at the Jiujiang Road warehouse in Shanghai this year.</p>
<p>According to survivors, before the fire, there was a sudden explosion from the warehouse. The ground around the warehouse cracked open, and five or six barrels were thrown out of the warehouse. One of the barrels contained a gelatinous substance, which scattered on the road and immediately ignited. At that time, a tram was passing by, and a ball of fire almost hit the carriage, which was very dangerous. Residents on the second, third, and fourth floors were blocked from escaping by smoke and flames. More than a dozen people jumped from the second floor and were injured, and dozens of people rushed out of the burning smoke, their heads and faces scorched. It is impossible to determine the number of people buried in the fire.</p>
<p>Goods Piled Up Like Mountains</p>
<p>The fact that Hong Kong has experienced three warehouse fires in just one month shows that the goods stored in Hong Kong, due to domestic restrictions, cannot be shipped out and have reached a "mountainous" level. Poor management has led to the tragedy. It is said that many of these goods were purchased and stored by large domestic merchants.</p>
<p>The goods are mainly chemical raw materials such as pigments and caustic soda, as well as oils. It is said that there are also some general merchandise from various countries.</p>
<h3>Another Fire</h3>
<p>Carelessness in the Film Room of the Beihe Theater</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Hong Kong, 24th] On the evening of the 23rd, a fire broke out in the film storage room of the Beihe Theater in Hong Kong due to carelessness, affecting nearby houses. Two people were killed and nine were injured. This fire is the fourth major fire in the past week, and all occurred in warehouses storing flammable materials.</p>

However, before being escorted to Hangzhou, Zhang, Ye, and Wang A-Long suddenly confessed that they had remaining accomplices hiding nearby. To lead the police in their apprehension, the police bureau, based on this confession, dispatched Inspector Zhang with officers on the morning of the 21st to escort the bandits. When they reached the outskirts of Houshi, Zhang Xin-Di, Ye Yu-Long, and Wang A-Long each suddenly broke and ran. The officers fired their guns in pursuit, but they did not heed the warnings.

<h3>Thunderstorm in Jiaxing at Night: A Bolt of Lightning—</h3>
<p>The Yard Filled with Red Light—A Section of the Utility Pole is Sliced Off</p>
<p>[Report from Jiaxing, this newspaper, 23rd] The weather has been sultry for days, with occasional showers. On the night of the 22nd, there was another thunderstorm.

Many people went to observe it on the 23rd.</p>
<h3>Inquiry into the Case of Gang Rape of a Regiment Commander's Wife in Hankou—Victim Breaks Down in Tears During Confrontation—Four Military Officers to be Sentenced to Death</h3>
<p>[Report from Hankou, this newspaper, 24th] The military court of the Supply Area Command continues its investigation into the case of six army hospital convalescing officers gang-raping the wife of a regiment commander. In addition to the prime suspects Cui Bowen, Shi Pan, Ling Zhi, Cha Dajun, Zeng Limin, and Yuan Shangzhi, the victim, Mrs. Lou Jiangting (i.e., Chen Tou), was also brought in for a confrontation. While recounting the ordeal, Chen's words were filled with sorrow, and she broke down in tears. After the interrogation, a responsible official of the military court told reporters that the facts of the rape had largely been established (details will be announced in the coming days). According to the Criminal Law of the Army, Navy, and Air Force, Cui, Shi, Ling, and Zeng should be sentenced to the sole penalty of death. Therefore, it is necessary to further investigate whether there were other circumstances between the prime suspects and the victim, to ensure that justice is served. Cha Dajun and Yuan Shangzhen, as they are not currently serving military personnel, will be transferred to the civilian court for trial immediately.</p>
<h3>The Dead End of "Gold Rushers" in the Borderlands: Corrupt Officials in Dihua Caught in the Net of Justice</h3>
<p>— Special Correspondent for This Newspaper, Changqing</p>
<p>[Airmail report from Dihua, 22nd] "Severely Punishing Corruption" is one of the main policies of Zhang Zhizhong's administration in Xinjiang. However, because many people from the interior who come to the borderlands have fantasies of striking it rich, this unhealthy mentality is deeply entrenched and cannot be eradicated in a short period. Therefore, ethnic minorities in the borderlands call all civil servants from the interior "headaches." These "headaches" have now reached a dead end. The prosecution of the former Deputy Director of the Department of Reconstruction, Gu Qianji, is a clear example of this. Other corruption cases, large and small, are also constantly emerging.</p>
<p>Deputy Director Profiting through Public Office</p>
<p>Qianji is currently 44 years old, a native of Wuyang, Jiangsu, and an animal husbandry expert. He originally served as the director of the Xinjiang Serum Factory. After the reorganization of the Xinjiang Provincial Government in the 35th year of the Republic, he was appointed as the Deputy Director of the Department of Reconstruction, one of the seven provincial government members representing the Central Government. In February of this year, the current Deputy Director of the Department of Reconstruction, Liu De'en, the Chief Accountant of the department, Gou Tingxiang, and the Inspection Director, Ni Zuxin, jointly reported Gu Qianji for corruption to the Northwest Headquarters, causing a sensation in the political circles of Dihua and attracting attention from people throughout Xinjiang. The authorities immediately escorted Gu Qianji to the Dihua District Court Procuratorate for investigation. After six months of investigation and evidence gathering by the prosecutor, an indictment was filed last month. The main points of the indictment are three:</p>
<p>(1) On October 21 of the 36th year of the Republic, the defendant, in the name of the Serum Factory, borrowed 80 million provincial dollars from the Department of Reconstruction's Coal Mine Factory as a winter coal relief fund for the poor (in the past, one Xinjiang provincial dollar was equivalent to five legal tender dollars; all figures below are in provincial dollars). On November 25, he borrowed another 20 million provincial dollars, clearly indicating private misappropriation of public funds.</p>
<p>(2) The Department of Reconstruction had many machines in Chongqing. The defendant proposed and passed a provincial government meeting to transport them to Dihua, with approved transportation costs of 600 million dollars. The actual receipt was 400 million dollars. After the defendant received the funds in late December of the 36th year of the Republic, he privately remitted 250 million dollars to Li Jiaode of the Jiading Bank in Shanghai. Of the remaining 150 million dollars, 15 million dollars were used to purchase cloth for the consultant of the Department of Reconstruction, Zi Daxin, 50 million dollars were used to subsidize the November salaries of staff, 10 million dollars were lent to the Southern Xinjiang Epidemic Prevention Team, 5 million dollars were used by the Serum Factory to manufacture vaccines, and 7 million dollars were lent to staff as year-end bonuses. The remainder was misappropriated by the defendant for personal use.</p>
<p>(3) The Department of Reconstruction received 70 million dollars for translating scientific books in late December of the 36th year of the Republic. After deducting legitimate expenses of 4 million dollars, the remaining amount was used by the defendant to purchase cloth, cigarettes, and other items. The above-mentioned acts of the defendant misappropriating public funds for personal gain constitute a crime in law.</p>
<p>After the District Court Criminal Division accepted the case, it held three investigative hearings and one open collegiate trial. Gu Qianji responded to the three points raised:</p>
<p>(1) The two loans from the Coal Mine Factory totaled only 100 million dollars. He did not specifically request them under the heading of the poor people's winter coal relief fund. The loans were taken out due to his wife's illness and a lack of savings. The loans, taken out in his private name, have all been repaid.</p>
<p>(2) The distribution of the special funds for transporting machinery, in addition to the items listed in the indictment, was used for travel expenses and resettlement allowances for staff. It cannot be said that he misappropriated them. The purchase of goods is also untrue.</p>
<p>(3) Of the 70 million dollars for translating books, over 10 million dollars were spent with receipts. As for the 66 million dollars spent on purchasing cloth and cigarettes, it is indeed a fact. This was because prices had risen when the funds were allocated, and the amount differed greatly from the original budget. It was also difficult to add additional funds, so the purchases were made to make up for the shortfall. The purchases were made for the sake of the public good, not for personal gain. In short, he acted too hastily and did not follow procedures, but he only wanted to do his best to complete the tasks he was responsible for. He never intended to profit personally.</p>
<p>The debate on this case has now concluded, and a verdict will be announced at a scheduled date after deliberation by the judges.</p>
<p>Shortage of Horses at the Livestock Farm</p>
<p>Two other corruption cases also occurred under the Department of Reconstruction. One involves Sha Wuke, the director of the Ceramics Factory, who owed wages from January to July of this year, totaling over 287.1 million provincial dollars (equivalent to over 1.435 billion legal tender dollars). Sha Wuke's younger brother, Se Ahong, withdrew 100 million provincial dollars and gave it to technician Se Dula to purchase raw materials in Shanshan. Only 4,000 catties were transported to Baishi, and there were no receipts. He also privately set up a glass factory on South Pole Rear Street. Many of the raw materials and items in the factory were public property. Sha Wuke also purchased 19 taels of gold. After the Department of Reconstruction discovered this a few days ago, Sha Wuke fled in fear of punishment.</p>
<p>The Department of Reconstruction investigated the facts of corruption and fraud by Patula, the director of the Yanqi Pasture under the Department of Reconstruction, and found that 33 horses and 100 sheep were missing. Public funds totaling 12,621,700 provincial dollars were also used. Patula has now been escorted to Dihua and transferred to the District Court for trial and punishment.</p>
<p>Cashier Lavishly Spends Money</p>
<p>Cases of automatic reporting by the District Procuratorate were rare in Dihua in the past. Recently, Ma Shouxiang, the chief cashier of the Department of Education, aroused the attention of the District Procuratorate because he spent money lavishly every day as an ordinary civil servant. After a preliminary investigation, it was confirmed that he was engaged in corruption and embezzlement. The amount of public funds embezzled, for which full evidence has been found, reached as much as 2 billion provincial dollars (10 billion legal tender dollars). An indictment was immediately filed. In addition to detaining Ma a few days ago, the investigation is continuing in preparation for filing a public prosecution.</p>

<h3>Importers and Exporters Association Recommends the Improvement of Multiple Restrictions and Facilitating Exports to the Export Management Committee</h3>
<p>[This newspaper dispatch] This city's Importers and Exporters Association has recently recommended four improvements to the Export Management Committee regarding the promotion of exports and the issue of export commodity price limits. The main points are recorded as follows: (1) The price limits for domestic export commodities should be made more practical. (2) Strict prohibition should be imposed on non-industry individuals purchasing export commodities. (3) Relevant authorities should uniformly facilitate the transportation of export goods throughout the country. (4) Relevant authorities should stipulate that export goods, if there is proof of sale abroad, should not be subject to the three-month restriction period.</p>
<p>[Another dispatch] The issuance of import permits for import goods has been temporarily suspended since August 19, so the import of goods has not yet returned to normal. In fact, import trade has stopped. The deadline for registration for Importers, Appendix Table (3) A, already stopped on June 20, and the review work is still in progress. It is expected that the results will be announced soon. It is heard that about 2,000 companies have qualified, and 800 companies are still awaiting review. The monthly approved imports of items listed in Appendix Table (3) A are only around several hundred thousand US dollars.</p>
<h3>The Authorities Order the Registration of Inventory; Rice Prices Fall; Flour is Available but Unmarketable, Leading to Stagnation</h3>
<p>The rice market has seen a slight decline. The prices of various grades of Japonica and Indica rice in the northern rice market have generally fallen by 10 cents. This is because the market management authorities have persuaded the industry to voluntarily form a pact and suppress prices on their own, so businesses have slightly reduced prices for sales. In the southern market, the prices of high-quality rice have fallen by 5 to 10 cents. Also, because the authorities have ordered the registration of inventory, morale has weakened, and supply is abundant. The number of registered arrivals has also increased. Yesterday, the total arrivals in the northern and southern markets totaled 5,036 piculs.</p>
<p>Flour</p>
<p>There have been no transactions, leading to stagnation. Because flour mills directly distribute to retailers, wholesalers have no supply, resulting in a lack of trading in the market. Even the low-quality Nan brand flour has seen no trading. Iron skin flour was offered at the limit price, 1,300 packages.</p>
<p>Grains</p>
<p>Continue to be firm. The supply of soybeans is scarce, and bean curd factories are absorbing them, with some transactions. New soybeans from Xuzhou were offered at 13.5 yuan. Maize from the northern region is being purchased very heavily, and prices have risen to the limit. Red sorghum supply is scarce and also rose by 20 cents. Broad beans are stable. The export of naked barley has revived, sales are brisk, and prices have risen by 20 to 30 cents. There have been no transactions in tea beans. Sesame remains at the original price, and raw peanuts from the plantations are still being traded at the limit price.</p>
<p>Cooking Oil</p>
<p>Market sentiment has fallen. Soybean oil and vegetable oil have each fallen by one yuan because the authorities have ordered the registration of inventory, and many people are selling their existing stocks. The closing price was 49.5 yuan. The factories did not open, and vegetable oil was 46 yuan, also down one yuan. Raw oil and small sesame oil are still stable due to scarcity. Datong brand soybean cakes were offered at 600 pieces, priced at 4.6 yuan.</p>
<h3>The Sugar Market Turns Weak</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market became weak because the rumors of allowing exports proved false. The appetite in this street turned weak, and customers stopped buying due to transportation difficulties, and the inventory in the market was instantly abundant. The prices of sugar in the 20th period from Taiwan were small after the tickets opened, and closing was increasingly weak. Coarse sugar and granulated sugar were sold off more, and the trend was even weaker. The others, such as refined white and red, were all brought down and smaller. The prices of each grade fell by an average of 5 to 8 or 9 cents compared to the previous day.</p>
<h3>Few Transactions in the Tea Market</h3>
<p>Yesterday's tea market continued to show a situation of scarce transactions and firm prices. Although buyers continue to come one after another, the owners ultimately defended their prices due to the high production costs, unwilling to let go lightly. Therefore, the result of negotiations between the two sides mostly fell into deadlock, and trading ultimately weakened. As for the trend, in this situation, it again meandered and showed signs of strength, and there was no precarious situation in the market.</p>
<p>It is reported that overseas attention to Chinese tea remains strong, but the high domestic production costs make it difficult to smoothly coordinate exports, resulting in a sharp decrease in recent export volumes. However, it is heard that some Chinese merchants and exporters are actively expanding foreign sales and establishing international markets. Although there is no profit to be made, they still plan to continue sales one after another. In this situation, the foreign tea market has no sign of weakness.</p>
<h3>The Deadline for Exchange is Approaching Rapidly; Gold, Silver, and Foreign Currency Exchange is Spiking Again</h3>
<p>Recently, due to the rapidly approaching deadline for the exchange of gold, silver, and foreign currency, citizens are rushing to exchange again. According to the Business Bureau of the National Bank, the total amount exchanged in this city on the 23rd was 35,670.608 taels of gold, 19,201.89 taels of silver, 94,099 yuan in silver dollars, 110,649 jiao in silver coins, 783,669 US dollars, and 147,190.76 Hong Kong dollars. The total value of the above five items was 10,643,435.84 gold yuan.</p>
<h3>Copper and Nickel Coins Returned by Japan Have Arrived in Shanghai</h3>
<p>Received by the National Bank and the China Trust Bureau</p>
<p>The Hai Liao ship of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company arrived in Shanghai on the afternoon of the 21st of this month from Sasebo, carrying the first batch of over 1,800 tons of copper and nickel coins that were looted by the Japanese army during the war, and berthed at the Zhanghuabang Wharf. On the evening of the 23rd, it was moved from Zhanghuabang to the Huangpu Wharf, and unloading began at 8:00 AM on the 24th. The Shanghai representative office of the Executive Yuan's Supervisory Committee for Japanese Reparations and Returned Materials specially dispatched a person in charge to preside over the event and handed over the copper and nickel coins to the Central Bank and the China Trust Bureau for joint receipt.</p>
<h3>Banks and Companies Reporting Foreign Exchange Should be Responsible by the Chairman and Others</h3>
<p>[This newspaper dispatch] It was recently learned from the Central Bank that the bank has received instructions from the Executive Yuan stating that when banks, companies, and firms report gold, cash, and foreign exchange, it should be stipulated that the chairman, managing director of each bank, company, and firm, with at least two people, and the general manager must jointly sign and affix their seals and be jointly responsible.</p>
<p>Another dispatch: The reporting of foreign exchange by foreign banks is being expedited. Only a few have not yet reported, and the foreign banks and firms that have reported have been gradually transferring their assets. Gold and foreign currency have been deposited into the Central Bank. Rumors of difficulties are definitely not true.</p>
<h3>Chinese Automobile Dealers Demand Equal Treatment with Foreign Dealers</h3>
<p>The Executive Yuan's Economic Management Committee, in accordance with the measures to strengthen economic controls, has set import quotas for the seventh and eighth quarters. The automobile cardong item, which was originally available in the fifth and sixth quarters, has been deleted. However, foreign companies can apply separately for the import of the above-mentioned vehicles, which has caused dissatisfaction among Chinese automobile dealers. They believe that the government is condoning foreign companies to import and prohibiting Chinese companies from importing automobiles, which not only consumes foreign exchange but also violates the principle of economy. The Automobile Business Association of this city has recently represented the Chinese automobile business houses with automobile import qualifications, submitting a report to the Economic Control Committee and the Thrift Guidance Committee of the Executive Yuan, requesting that they receive the same treatment as foreign companies.</p>
<h3>The Silk Reeling Association Resolves to Maintain the Limit Price for Autumn Cocoons</h3>
<p>And Supply Raw Silk to the Silk Weaving Industry</p>
<p>The Silk Reeling Industry Association of the Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Shanghai regions convened a joint meeting of directors and supervisors a few days ago at the Bankers' Association Clubhouse on Hong Kong Road, chaired by Chairman Chen Aishi, to discuss the procurement of autumn cocoons for this season. It was noted that autumn cocoons in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces have already entered the market. On the 20th of this month, the association received a telegram from the Four Banks Joint Office suspending loans for autumn cocoons. Silk manufacturers are now negotiating loans with commercial banks and renting lines to purchase cocoons. The governments of Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces, in accordance with the Outline of the Sericulture Production and Sales Plan, have stipulated a standard fresh cocoon price of 80 yuan per city dan. However, according to reports from cocoon-producing areas, speculators are competing to purchase cocoons, causing the price to soar, exceeding the government regulations, especially in Wuxi. In order to comply with government laws and regulations, the association has resolved:</p>
<p>(1) The association will notify all member factories to strictly adhere to the government's stipulated price for purchasing cocoons. (2) The association will send letters to relevant authorities requesting that they effectively crack down on non-industry personnel (i.e., [unclear characters] merchants) from purchasing cocoons to prevent dried cocoons from becoming hoarding targets. (3) The association will submit reports to relevant ministries and the Four Banks Joint Office requesting that manufacturers who have purchased dry cocoons be provided with pawn loans to facilitate capital flow and that the autumn silk reeled be purchased continuously in accordance with the original method, with unified export sales, so that the government can control export goods and earn foreign exchange.</p>
<p>Furthermore, in order to comply with the government's new economic measures and to consider the raw material needs of the silk weaving industry, the association unanimously resolved that it would notify all member factories that, in addition to the raw silk that should be handed over to the government for purchase and that which is suitable for export, they should allocate and sell their remaining raw silk to the silk weaving industry at the market price on August 19 to show mutual assistance. The Standing Committee has been authorized to coordinate the allocation to various factories based on the number of machines and production volume of each member factory.</p>
<h3>Woolen Fabrics Are Actually Selling Well</h3>
<p>Recently, as the weather has turned cooler, more people are making winter clothes, and woolen fabrics are selling well. The business of men's and women's clothing, both Western and Chinese styles, is booming. Customers from Nanjing, Hangzhou, and other places are also coming to Shanghai to place orders in an endless stream. The most popular items are medium-thick serge and navy blue wool gabardine, as well as overcoat woolens ranging from over 20 yuan to 40 yuan.</p>
<h3>The Rayon Market is Calm</h3>
<p>The rayon market is quiet. Silk weaving mills have an appetite for rayon and are turning to supply it through rationing, sales are still smooth, and the market is moderately firm. Owners are very unwilling to sell, buyers' willingness to purchase is also weak, and morale seems to be very calm. No. 120 Tianqiao has some transactions at the limit price.</p>
<h3>Transactions of Spot Cotton are Thin</h3>
<p>Yesterday, spot cotton transactions were still thin. Due to the weak supply from various places, arrivals are few and stocks are scarce. Owners are unwilling to let go lightly, and yarn factories have a relaxed appetite, resulting in few transactions. 37 bales of Zhengzhou cotton were traded, and 136 bales of Shashi cotton were traded at prices of 141 yuan and 140 yuan. Zhoupu seed cotton was 30 yuan and 8 cents, with the good rising by 6 cents.</p>
<h3>Promoting the Shares of State-Owned Enterprises; The National Bank Plans Three Measures</h3>
<p>The Central Bank is actively seeking ways to remedy the shares of state-owned enterprises. According to the head of the bank, they are planning to open up sales channels for the shares of state-owned enterprises. Three measures have been decided: (1) The assets and liabilities of each unit of state-owned enterprises should be quickly reported, printed separately, and distributed for investors to choose from. (2) Guarantee the interests of investors and increase dividends. (3) Revise the dividend payment method to increase investors' interest. In the past, interest was paid once a year, but now it is planned to pay interest every three months. (4) Increase the sales area and gradually spread it to major cities.</p>
<h3>The Yarn Market is Apparently Flat But Actually Firm; Cloth Hoarders Release Their Stocks and Prices Fall Sharply</h3>
<p>Yesterday's yarn market remained strong, with both coarse and fine yarns reaching the limit price. The appetite in this street remained strong, and the market was apparently flat but actually firm. The supply of 42-count fine yarn was not abundant, and few transactions were made, but prices reached the limit. 40-count and 32-count yarns were traded at the limit price, and the market showed no signs of weakness. 21-count Double Horse Shenxin was offered at 770 yuan and traded at 780 yuan in the market, the price was the same as the previous day. The prices of 20-count yarns, except for Hong Kuixing, Double Carp, and Jiuhua, which were slightly off the limit, were all at the limit price. 16-count and 10-count yarns rose by 3.5 yuan each.</p>
<p>The cloth market was deeply affected by the commodity registration and saw a sharp decline yesterday. Because the registered warehouse inventory will be subject to stricter controls, hoarders were nervous and rushed to sell their stocks first. Empty orders returned to wreak havoc, causing a widespread decline.</p>
<p>Dragon Head fine cloth retreated from 27.4 yuan, and at 11:15 AM, it was traded at a low of 25.6 yuan. Sijunzi Yuan twill retreated from 27.3 yuan to 26.9 yuan. Wufu and Laba Tong fine cloths were all offered for sale at 24 yuan. With more supply than demand, prices were like fallen leaves in the autumn wind, declining continuously.</p>
<p>Because the speculators had profits to compensate for the losses, the selling pressure eased slightly. Also, the prices of goods in other cities were brisk. If the commodity registration was only aimed at investigating the amount of inventory, and if the issuance of export certificates was likely to be implemented soon, morale stabilized slightly. Dragon Head fine cloth rebounded to close at 26.6 yuan, down 1.4 yuan from the previous day. Wufu fine cloth later rebounded to 24.6 yuan, ultimately down 1 yuan. Laba Tong fell by 1.2 yuan, Sijunzi Yuan twill traded at a low of 26.9 yuan and finally closed at 27.5 yuan. Most of the remaining fabrics declined, and trading increased sharply. The total transaction volume in the city was 2,160 pieces.</p>

<h3>Hao Gengsheng Discusses Impressions of British and American Sports, Trends in World Sports, Promoting Recreational Sports</h3>
<p>[This newspaper's dispatch] Hao Gengsheng, the general secretary of the Chinese National Sports Association, returned to Shanghai the day before yesterday after attending the World Games and inspecting British and American sports. Hao specially hosted reporters from various newspapers in the city at the Municipal Gymnasium at 4 PM yesterday to share his observations and impressions gained in the UK and US in great detail. A summary is as follows:</p>
<p>British Calm and Serious</p>
<p>During this two-month trip abroad, I stayed in the UK and the US for about a month each. I deeply realized that sports are an important part of education and are related to the entire national political, social, and economic structure. British sports fully demonstrate their calm, serious, and unexaggerated national character and style. The World Games were also like this. Although its organization and propaganda arrangements were not as grand as the previous Berlin World Games, its success cannot be denied. Due to the UK's national economic difficulties, the sports community is also working together to overcome the difficulties, making full use of school equipment and simple sports equipment to provide children with sports and recreational activities. School sports facilities are relatively complete, and special attention is paid to children's sports activities. At this time of considerable food scarcity, children's nutrition is still fully supplied. During the World Games, other sports activities in various places did not stop slightly. On a Saturday holiday, as many as 400,000 people went on hikes, demonstrating their emphasis on sports and recreation. They pay special attention to sports teachers, and their slogan is: "A good sports system is important, but good teachers are even more important." The distinction between amateur and professional sports is very clear. The sports community does not approve of professional sports, but it also recognizes its value.</p>
<p>American Luxurious and Magnificent</p>
<p>In the United States, I visited sports facilities in New York, Boston, Washington, Chicago, and various parts of Jinshan. What the United States shows is very different from the UK, it is luxurious and magnificent sports. The abundance of sports funding, the completeness of sports equipment in various schools, the universality of social sports activities, and the large number of talents are far beyond our dreams. The Chicago municipal government even has a recreation bureau, which specializes in managing and promoting citizens' recreation and sports. Its scale is so great that it can set up its own factory to manufacture sports equipment. I visited a golf club factory with as many as 600 workers, and its branches numbered eight throughout the country, specializing in the manufacture of clubs alone. The establishment of temporary swimming pools in various places, built with wooden boards, oilcloth, and paper paste, which can be filled with water to form a pool and are extremely convenient to disassemble and assemble, can be called a new structure in sports. Professional sports are particularly developed in the United States, but restrictions on amateur sports are still very strict. Today, the new trend in world sports after the war is to make sports activities into sports entertainment. Today, American university sports departments also have entertainment departments to train talents for entertainment sports work. The result of this kind of effort in the United States is (1) to improve physical and mental health, (2) to enrich life interest, (3) to increase work efficiency, (4) to improve people's morals, and (5) to reduce urban crime. And their research progress in sports academic theory is also beyond the reach of others, and their contribution to world sports is profound and huge.</p>
<p>Our Country's Sports</p>
<p>Based on what I have gained from this inspection, I deeply feel that our country's sports should adopt strengths, compensate for weaknesses, and choose the good and follow it. The following four points are particularly urgent: (1) Establish national sports funding, (2) Actively cultivate sports talents, (3) Lay the foundation for school sports, (4) Establish sports academic research institutions. Chinese sports have some hope.</p>

<h3>Public Tennis Doubles Championship Today Rematch, Tao Wang vs. Ye Cai at 3:30 PM</h3>
<p>The last act of public tennis, the men's doubles match between Tao Guanqiu and Wang Wenzheng against Ye Guanxiong and Cai Guoji, was not completed due to rain this Wednesday. The Tao Wang team was leading 7-5, 4-2. With the consent of both parties, the referee Lin Shihua canceled the results of the previous match and rescheduled it for 3:30 PM this afternoon at the Youth Tennis Club to determine the final championship of the open. These two doubles pairs are undoubtedly the strongest combination of the season. Although Tao Wang has been dominating undefeated for many years, it seems difficult to be sure of winning this time. Tickets today are sold at a uniform price of one yuan. Previous spectators can enter with their ticket stubs. Those who hold complimentary tickets that have been collected and canceled can sign their names at the entrance to attend.</p>
<h3>US Basketball Team Embarks for the Far East</h3>
<p>Shanghai Not on the Itinerary</p>
<p>[United Press Oakland, California 23rd dispatch] A basketball team here plans to embark on a long journey to the Far East on October 2nd to learn from various countries in the East. Team leader Bidner recently announced that the average height of the entire team is six feet four and a half inches, including World Games athlete Los Angeles California University He Zhubashi, high school star Xia Lou, and Stanford University star Fu Shu, totaling eleven people. California international athlete Arron Meda will serve as the field coach. The itinerary is as follows: First, go to Manila for three matches, then to Tokyo, and after returning to Manila, return to the United States via Honolulu.</p>
<h3>Donations from Overseas for Our World Games Delegation</h3>
<p>[This newspaper's dispatch] Regarding donations for the Chinese World Games delegation, Hao Gengsheng told reporters yesterday that a total of US$8,000 was received from the Philippines, US$8,000 was also received from Singapore, and Indonesia was unable to obtain the funds because the Dutch government prohibited large sums from being remitted to London. Only 200 yuan was spent when contacting the South Seas, and the airfare was more than 700 yuan. His wife, Ms. Gao Zi, went to the UK to attend the World Sports and Recreation Conference by order of the Executive Yuan, and the stipulated expenses were paid from the 25,000 US dollars given by the government. The hotel in London only cost more than two pounds a day for one person, which is not considered expensive, and the World Games athletes lived in dormitories, which also cost twenty shillings a day, etc.</p>
<h3>Insurance Cup Ping Pong Tournament Scheduled for Next Monday</h3>
<p>The Insurance Cup Team Ping Pong Championship, organized by the Insurance Industry Colleagues Advancement Association of this city, has 15 participating teams. After more than two months of competition, the Dai Ren, United, and Tai An Salt teams have the best results, each with twelve wins. The Dai Ren team has the strongest strength and the highest voice for the championship, but the team aims to perform and is unwilling to calculate points, and automatically gives up the right to win the championship. In order to conclude the final battle, the organizing authorities convened a competition affairs meeting last night and resolved: (1) The final will be held at 7 PM on September 27th at the auditorium on the fourth floor of the Bank of China on Renji Road Bund.

<h3>Yu Dafu's Will</h3>
<p>— Lao Dan</p>
<p>Third Anniversary of Disaster</p>
<p>Yu Dafu's misfortune in Nanyang has been exactly three years to this day. Although there is no way to find out the exact date of his misfortune, some say it was September 25th, others say it was August 28th, and still others say it was September 18th. In short, it was not long after Japan surrendered to the United Nations. Calculated by time, it has been three years.</p>
<p>During the past three years, no one has yet organized and published Dafu's complete works. Only Zheng Ziyu's "Collection of Dafu's Poems and Lyrics" has been published. This small collection of poems and lyrics not only contains few poems and lyrics, but also does not include Dafu's nineteen poems on destroying his family. In addition, there are many errors in the words, and the editor also attached his own works as a tail, making it neither fish nor fowl. Even so, only this small booklet of poems and lyrics has been circulated as Dafu's posthumous works. The desolate situation of a literati after his death can be seen in general.</p>
<p>What kind of legacy did Dafu leave behind? This is what many people who care about Dafu want to know. He suffered misfortune in the autumn of the 34th year of the Republic of China. Strangely, he wrote a will in the first month of the lunar calendar that year. It is not known whether he was really writing a "will as an example at the beginning of each year" or whether he was temporarily moved and knew that life was fleeting, so he wrote a will in advance. If those superstitious people were to say that this will of his was a prophecy, written at the beginning of spring and passed away in the autumn. We don't need to study these things. Now, I will record the full text of his will:</p>
<p>"I am already fifty-four years old. Even if I die now, I will enjoy a middle-aged life. Heaven has unpredictable winds and clouds. Every year at the beginning of the year, I write a will as an example to prevent accidents.</p>
<p>Since changing my career to business, it has been almost eight years. All the profits I have made have been given to my friends, relatives, and poor people, so there are not many savings. According to statistics, the current cash is about two ten thousand shields. The property in the family is worth about three ten thousand shields. "Dan Jiebin" has a residential cottage and a piece of land, 125 meters long and 25 meters wide, totaling more than 14,000 shields. All these properties, vegetables, cash, gold, silver, utensils, etc., should be jointly managed by my wife, He Liyou, and my son, Daya, and his brother or sister (not yet born). The paper mill and "Qijiapo" shares, etc., are not included because they have not been determined.</p>
<p>In the country, there is a residence in Guanchang Alley in Hangzhou and a collection of five million volumes of books. After this great chaos, I don't know if they still exist. There are also three sons in the country, Fei, Yun, and Jun. Although there is no inheritance, it is expected that they have grown up. Separated by thousands of miles, there is no way to ask about them. My writings under my pen name include more than ten kinds. For more than ten years, I have not received a penny in royalties. If someone can negotiate with the Shanghai Beixin Bookstore, which publishes these books, the three sons in the country may be able to obtain tens of thousands of yuan, but this is an unknown number and is not a confirmed property, so there is no need to write it down. New Year's Day in the year of Yiyou."</p>
<p>New Year's Day in the year of Yiyou is February of the 34th year. The will says that he has been in business for eight years, which does not seem to be true, because he left Singapore in February of the second year after the outbreak of the Pacific War, and he only started the Zhaoyu Distillery in the autumn of that year. By February of the 34th year, he had only been in business for more than two years. The eight years mentioned seem to be embellishments. If calculated from the time he went to Nanyang from the country, it would be more than six years. The residence in Guanchang Alley in Hangzhou refers to the thatched cottage in the wind and rain. However, the number of five million volumes of books he said may be a mistake, because five million volumes of books occupy a lot of space. But from another perspective, the legacy of a generation of literati is only this trivial amount, which is also very regrettable.</p>
<h3>Also Discussing Brush Fees</h3>
<p>— You Mo Jun</p>
<p>Some time ago, this publication carried an article by Mr. Xiao Tui entitled "Serious Words on Brush Fees." It provided comprehensive examples of the origins of brush fees and various titles for self-determined rates, making it quite interesting to read. It is said that the term "brush fee" appears in official history in the Biography of Zheng Yi in the Book of Sui. The biography states: "Yi was restored to the title of Duke of Pei, appointed Pillar of the State, and the emperor ordered Li Delin to draft an imperial edict. Gao Jiong jokingly said to Yi, 'Your brush is dry!' Yi replied, 'Having served as a regional shepherd, I returned home with only my walking stick, without a single coin. How can I afford to wet my brush?' The emperor laughed heartily." If the brush is dry, it needs to be wetted; this humorous exchange is considered the origin of the term "brush fee" by later generations.</p>
<p>When people pay to request calligraphy or paintings, they often ask for an inscription to be added as a sign of respect. There are two main reasons for this: first, the requester admires the great name of the artist and wishes to establish a spiritual connection; second, with the inscription, the work cannot be taken or stolen by others and can be permanently treasured. However, in the past, some calligraphers and painters refused to add inscriptions, or if they did, they would charge double the brush fee. Zhang Yu was an example of the former, and Kang Youwei was an example of the latter. The reason they refused to add inscriptions was that they had a very high opinion of themselves. They thought, "I do not know you personally, so how can I address just anyone as 'Benevolent Brother,' 'Sir,' or 'Master'!" It's hard to understand that if you are already selling your calligraphy, how could you be so concerned? Kang Youwei came up with the harsh rule of charging double for inscriptions to limit requests, but he shot himself in the foot and became a laughingstock.</p>
<p>There was a certain Mr. A whose background was unknown, but he had a lot of money. He specially asked Kang Youwei to write calligraphy and requested an inscription. After paying the double fee, he went to collect his piece one day, only to find that the inscription only had the two characters of Mr. A's given name, with the character below it missing. He was furious and questioned Kang, saying, "How dare you address me by my given name without respect!" After speaking, he angrily tore Kang's calligraphy into pieces and threw them on the ground. Kang had never experienced such an insult, and his beard bristled with anger. He scooped up the money that Mr. A. had paid and threw it at his head. For a moment, the coins fell to the ground, dancing and spinning. Mr. A left without a word.</p>
<p>Some calligraphers and painters also charged double if no inscription was added. Xiao Tuitang of Yushan was skilled in seal script, which had a particularly charming ancient flavor. Therefore, some art dealers specifically asked him to write single pieces to make them easier to sell, because with an inscription, people would either "not want" it or "ask for a lower price." Mr. Xiao was aware of this, and because he saw them as stockpiling goods, he came up with a method of charging double the fee if no inscription was added. This was told to me by a friend; I don't know if it's true.</p>
<p>Tang Tuo, who specialized in writing shop signs, was one who included a standard scale of measurements with his fee schedule. There was a time when his calligraphy could be seen everywhere on shop signs, big and small, in Shanghai. He probably realized that those bosses were too picky: if the writing was slightly larger, they would ask for it to be rewritten; if it was slightly smaller, they would also ask for it to be rewritten. Tang felt overwhelmed by the hassle, so he included a scale of measurements with his fee schedule, specifying how much the brush fee would be for each character of a certain size, so that requesters could determine a standard size for themselves. However, this was unique in fee schedules.</p>
<h3>Watching the Tide at Haining</h3>
<p>— Zheng Xiaocang</p>
<p>In the eighth month, angry tides roll on the river,</p>
<p>Ten thousand horses gallop, displaying heavenly power.</p>
<p>A thousand fathoms of silver peaks are frightening as they pass,</p>
<p>A hundred zhang of swift currents are seen as already far away.</p>
<p>The crane-like iron shovel cleaves the waves and goes forward,</p>
<p>The carefree egret chases the greasy waves.</p>
<p>In the deep blue, the sea is calm, and tourists make merry,</p>
<p>Straddling iron oxen and blowing short flutes.</p>
<h3>Mr. Hu Yaguang Made a Simple Line Drawing Portrait for Me, Extremely Lifelike. Delighted, I Respond with a Poem and Inscribe it on the Portrait</h3>
<p>— Gao Chuiwan</p>
<p>Opening the letter brings a smile,</p>
<p>I recognize my true self.</p>
<p>This skill is beyond skill,</p>
<p>The person is truly wonderful.</p>
<p>With just a few strokes,</p>
<p>The whole spirit is vividly seen.</p>
<p>Ashamed of my poetic and scholarly aura,</p>
<p>It can only convey the appearance of an old rustic.</p>
<h3>Reimbursement</h3>
<p>— Dongfang Jibai</p>
<p>After reading Mr. Lao Dan's "Signature and Seal" and Mr. You Mo Jun's "Sealing" in "Freedom Forum," I was reminded of the matter of "reimbursement."</p>
<p>In every organization, large or small, after spending money, it is customary to "prepare a reimbursement report." There are IOUs for borrowing, vouchers for payments, seals required for recipients, notes required for those in debt, and receipts required for buying things. Preparing a reimbursement report requires a "receipt attachment book." Not only must the numbers match, but everything must be firmly documented. The details must be clear and orderly, without a single mistake. It seems flawless and certainly consumes a lot of energy for the office staff, but this entire set of official formalities is just an added inconvenience with no meaning.</p>
<p>"Preparing a reimbursement report" requires an experienced hand to ensure that it is "approved" upon submission. If one reports honestly and openly, one will almost certainly run into trouble. Mildly, one will be reprimanded; severely, one will be punished and given demerits, or even lose one's job. Many "office workers" get a headache when they hear about preparing reimbursement reports, and it is not without reason.</p>
<p>Where does the "experience" of an experienced hand lie? It lies in knowing how to falsify.</p>
<p>In the drawers of experienced hands, there is no shortage of store stamps, personal stamps, large and small, round and square. Whatever kind of receipt is needed for the reimbursement report can be quickly produced and used. This saves time and effort, and the prices can be set at will. If something is missing, the required receipt is written in advance and taken to a merchant to ask them to stamp it, and they will not refuse, as merchants are also well aware of this practice. This is an open secret.</p>
<p>Preparing a "reimbursement report" must comply with the "budget." Any changes are illegal. If the budget for paper and stationery is a certain amount, the reimbursement report must also show that amount. If the budget for postage and telecommunications is a certain amount, the reimbursement report must also show that amount. It cannot be more or less, but must be just right. A thick reimbursement book is full of falsified accounts, which has long become a very common thing. When submitted, the "higher-ups" also know it is false but never investigate. Sometimes, it might be "returned" for rewriting because the numbers do not match, and this continues until they do match. This is simply the "higher-ups" forcing the "lower-downs" to falsify. This practice has been around for a long time, and everyone is used to it; no one has ever questioned, objected, or protested.</p>
<p>The travel expenses for public officials on business trips have specific regulations, but some still need to prepare a reimbursement report after the trip is completed. On a certain day of a certain month, how much was spent on food and how much was spent on transportation must be verified and submitted for approval. Those on business trips also have evidence and documentation, no more and no less, exactly matching the prescribed amount. The reporters are all falsifying, and the supervisors know it but do not ask.</p>
<p>I think there is nothing more "official" than "preparing a reimbursement report." Superiors and subordinates deceive each other without finding it strange, wasting paper, ink, energy, and time on a series of "submission for review" and "approval" official procedures. What is the benefit of this? What does it mean?</p>
<p>I firmly advocate the complete eradication of this reimbursement ideology.</p>
<h3>Odds and Ends</h3>
<p>— Xian Si</p>
<p>Germany is experiencing a severe paper shortage. In Berlin, residents who want to obtain a new phone book must not only return the old one but also pay seventeen pounds of waste paper (old newspapers, old books, etc.).</p>
<p>There is a bookbinding expert in New York who pays great attention to the matching of the book's cover and content. For a book specifically about ostriches, he used ostrich skin for the cover. For a book specifically about skin diseases, he used human skin as the cover!</p>
<h3>Slot Machines</h3>
<p>— Mao Yi</p>
<p>Although "slot machines" are quite unfamiliar to the Chinese people, they are not completely unknown. During the time when copper coins were in circulation before the war, there was a type of "fortune-telling machine" on the streets of Shanghai. By putting a copper coin into a small hole, a fortune slip would drop out of another hole. This kind of device can also be considered a type of slot machine. This summer, some cold drink shops in Shanghai had slot machines that dispensed Coca-Cola, which can be considered authentic Americanized slot machines.</p>
<p>In today's America, slot machines have become a part of the lives of Americans. Slot machines are set up in theaters, hotels, train stations, other public places, and even on streets and sidewalks. By inserting a coin, one can get cigarettes, candy, gum, peanuts, beer, stamps, and other daily necessities. Some slot machines even provide ice, insurance policies, and even wash clothes. There are as many as 24,000 companies operating slot machines, employing 2 million people.</p>
<p>However, all of this is just the beginning. Many novel slot machines are currently being planned or manufactured. Housewives will be able to buy frozen food from slot machines. Automatic large bill exchange machines will save people from the trouble of not having small bills. Travelers will not only be able to buy train tickets from slot machines but will also be able to buy razor blades with the same convenience. Slot machines will even be able to shine shoes with automatic shoe-shining machines!</p>
<p>Although slot machines are considered a modern invention, their true origins can actually be traced back to 100 to 200 years before the Common Era. When Professor Baynard of London's Woodcroft translated "The Pneumatics of Hero of Alexandria," he discovered that this skillful Egyptian craftsman had already made primitive slot machines. He invented a ritual device: whoever put in five silver coins would have holy water spurt out of the device. This device combined religion and commerce.</p>
<h3>Maotai and Whiskey</h3>
<p>— Chen Yixian</p>
<p>Guizhou Maotai liquor has been famous for a long time, and I have always regretted not having tasted it. After the victory, Maotai suddenly flooded the market. I bought a bottle and drank it, but it was not good. It was far inferior to Sichuan's Mianzhu Daqu, so I thought it was merely an overrated name. A few days ago, during the Mid-Autumn Festival, a friend gifted me a bottle of Maotai brought from Kunming. When I opened the bottle and poured the liquor into a cup, a fragrant aroma wafted into my nose. Tasting it, it had a slightly bitter taste, but after a while, it turned sweet on the palate, and the fragrance was rich and unmatched by other liquors. At the same time, a friend from Beiping sent a package of jujubes. They were deep red, slightly pointed at both ends, not very large, and the pits were extremely small. Every one was free of worms. I used them to accompany the Maotai liquor. The liquor was fragrant and strong, and the jujubes had the three qualities of being fresh, crisp, and sweet. They were indeed the jujubes from Langjiayuan in Beiping. (Langjiayuan is located in western Beijing and is famous for producing jujubes.) In "Water Margin," Wu Yong cleverly obtained birthday gifts by adding anesthesia to white wine and serving it with a large bowl of fresh jujubes, which drugged Yang Zhi and his men, allowing him to steal gold and jewels. It can be seen that good liquor and good jujubes can move people.</p>
<p>My friend from Kunming said, "Maotai Village is located in Renhuai County, Guizhou. It is a mountainous area, and the liquor is made with stream water, similar to how Shaoxing wine is made with the water of Jian Lake. Old wine is not good without Jian Lake water, and Maotai is not pure and rich without mountain stream water. In the past, Maotai had cellars that were over a hundred years old. The winemakers passed down the tradition of mixing wheat and other ingredients into the fermentation pits, which had to be left for two full years before being opened for sale. Also, due to inconvenient transportation, it could not be sold far away, so the supply exceeded the demand, and the old wine accumulated more and more. That is why the name of Maotai became famous throughout the world. More than ten years ago, when Zhu and Mao led their forces to break out of their old nest in Ruijin, Jiangxi, and passed through the provinces of Hunan, Guangxi, Guizhou, and Sichuan to northern Shaanxi, Maotai was right on their route. All the old cellars were destroyed. Now, Maotai liquor is all produced from new cellars. In addition, more is being transported out by road and air, so the demand exceeds the supply. Some cellars are opened in less than two years, so Maotai liquor is not as good as it used to be. The bottle I sent is old cellar liquor, which is not easy to buy even in Kunming."</p>
<p>Two days after the Mid-Autumn Festival (September 19), my brother Cui Yunsheng invited me to drink at his Shenli Wine Shop. The dishes were Fujian cuisine, and the liquor was aged whiskey. The weather was extremely hot that day, no less than in midsummer. Everyone had a large glass in front of them, filled one-quarter with liquor, and then topped off with ice soda or lemonade. I drank the first glass in one gulp, and a coolness spread throughout my body. The aroma of the liquor was not as good as Maotai, but it was more refreshing. This is a special strength of foreign liquor. Because the liquor had been aged for many years, the taste was extremely pure and rich. Those who gathered together that day included Zhou Soujuan, Fan Yanqiao, Li Zukui, Gan Jingxian (the younger brother of the late Mr. Yuan), Pan Zixin, and Shen Xieshen. All the talents were present, and the host and guests enjoyed the best of southeastern China. We unconsciously raised our glasses frequently, and I ended up quite drunk. It had been twelve years since I had such a hearty drink after July 7th. Whiskey comes from Scotland in England and is made from wheat, the same as Maotai. French brandy is made from grapes, our old wine is made from glutinous rice, and Yanghe Daqu is made from sorghum. These liquors use different raw materials, but all aged ones are good and have their own special flavors. This Mid-Autumn Festival, I had the opportunity to taste two kinds of famous liquors, both Chinese and foreign, within three days, and I must record it.</p>

<h3>Explanation from the Port Quarantine Station: Shanghai Port Epidemic Prevention Measures</h3>
<p>Received your institution's Social Services Department's letter regarding reader Yang Wanyou's suggestions for quarantine work. We forwarded the original document to the relevant department for review. We are grateful for your kind attention. Here are the replies to Mr. Yang's original opinions, categorized as follows: (1) The Ministry of Health approved the vaccination fees in its July 20 order, 防 (37) 字 No. 12931. Item 16 of the fee adjustment table stipulates that the fee for a vaccination certificate is 100,000 Legal Tender yuan per certificate. To promote vaccination work, our station temporarily reduces the fee to 60,000 yuan. The current charge of 3 Gold Yuan cents is only equivalent to 90,000 yuan, which has not yet reached the standard set by the Ministry. (2) Smallpox is still being discovered in Shanghai, which remains a smallpox epidemic port. According to the seaport quarantine procedures, travelers still need to be vaccinated against smallpox to prevent the spread of infection to other locations. (3) Vaccination hours are currently from 9:00 AM to 12:00 PM, 1:30 PM to 5:00 PM, and 5:00 PM to 12:00 AM. Please take note of the above information! Shanghai Seaport Quarantine Station of the Ministry of Health. September 14.</p>
