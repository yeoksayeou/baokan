<h3 id="c4">我代表團下周赴美 <a href="#c4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>外部昨公告各專家人選　美工商界發起援華運動</p>
<p>（本報南京九日電）關於我國派遣技術代表團赴美會商美國援華事，外部九日發表公告如下：中國政府依照中國外交部與美國務院商討之結果，現派遣代表團前任華府，對有關美國援華之問題交換意見。中國政府並經派定前中央銀行總裁貝祖詒主持該團任務，此外並派外交部顧問李幹，交通部路政司幫辦洪紳，賢源委員會駐美代表辦事處總代表陳良輔及貨幣專家朱葆貞襄助貝氏。</p>
<p>代表團一行，定本月十四日由滬乘機赴美。李氏於月前參加馬尼剌遠東經委會後，即轉道赴美，陳氏則原在美，現均住華盛頓。按此項基數代表團原定由俞大維，貝祖詒兩氏率領，後以俞氏所掌交部公務繁要，兼以母病危不克分身，故中止成行，然據權威人士稱，俞氏將來仍有赴美一行之可能，惟時機當在美援問題瓜熟蒂落之際。</p>
<p>（中央社華盛頓八日電）美參院外交委員會今日要求馬歇爾國務卿，儘速向　會提出對華援助計劃費用之估計。</p>
<p>（合眾社紐約八日電）美國在華有利益關係之工商界人士，八日在美國遠東工商業協會開會時，決定在華盛頓發起一大規模立即予中國適當援助之運動，旋即由中國前行政院副院長孔祥熙博士，向六百以上之會員及來賓發表演說。孔氏警告稱：「吾國資源現已涸竭，如美不予援助，吾國可能感受更大之困苦。」孔氏攻擊中共叛亂稱：「如共黨僅係欲有政治權利，則無人可以非難，但以武裝叛變，在軍事，經濟，社會上損害國家之完整，則政府應加以抵抗。」</p>
<p>美對華政策</p>
<p>一年來的演變</p>
<p>（合眾社華盛頓九日電）一年前本週，馬歇爾調停中國內戰無成，鎩羽歸國，並發表「禍臨雙方」之文告，痛斥國共雙方阻撓和平解決。杜魯門總統於一九四六年十二月十八日曾發表對華政策聲明，馬帥文告　加以強調，謂除非蔣主席「擴大其政府」，以容納「更多自由份子」，美國實無從援華。</p>
<p>然而今日身為國務卿馬歇爾，正飭其屬僚起草渠在十一月中所主張以美金三億元援助中國復興之長期計劃。此說明美對華政策之演變。</p>
<p>去年一月七日馬歇爾　華返國後，美官方立場為且讓國共廝殺數月，至想吃不下之際，則國共合作共組聯合政府之時機瓜熟蒂落。官方以為國共雙方均力不足以取得決定性勝利，必致顧慮談判，然彼等現時承認估計錯誤，而使共黨獲利。美對華態度之顯著轉變在今年七月間，當時杜魯門遣魏德邁赴華調查　情，以決定援華之方式。同時，美國會通過在聯總結束後以二千七百七十萬元救濟品供給中國。八月廿四之文告，若干方面解釋魏氏文告關係閉援華之門，然消息靈通人士稱，文告之主要宗旨為加強蔣主席撲滅國民黨內若干反動分子之力量。魏使歸返華府，向杜魯門及馬歇爾提出報告，由於其內容　率討論中國之弱點及美國對華政策牽涉蘇聯，故至今尚未公開，然該報告建議大量援華，包括軍事方面援助蔣主席。</p>
<p>雖中國情形複雜異常，各方論調不一，然在新年伊始之時，顯然美國已決定以類似給與希臘，法國，意大利之援助給予中國。</p>
<h3 id="c5">防止港九走私　中英即訂協定 <a href="#c5" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e5" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">5</a></h3>

<p>（中央社南京九日電）記者頃自政府方面獲悉：關於影響我國稅收及國民經濟至鉅之港九走私問題，外交部會與英國香港政府及倫敦方面，一再交涉，現英方亦瞭解此事，對於中國經濟有莫大關係，已接受我國所提之方案，與我商安正式協定，並於本月十二日簽字。此項協定簽定，則我可派關務人員在港九防止走私，香港政府並須予以協助。</p>
<h3 id="c6">經濟方案實施辦法　商業部份草案擬定 <a href="#c6" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e6" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">6</a></h3>

<h3 id="c9">取締居奇辦法之檢討 <a href="#c9" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e9" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">9</a></h3>
<p>本報昨論物價問題，主張應注重在增加生產，公平分配，穩定幣值，平衝預算這些積極辦法着皮膚，切實認眞去　，而不可僅僅注意於登記檢查這些消極的取締手段。這並不是說「取締」一定不可用，不過無論如何至多僅能收一時片刻之效，而無補於大計。而且，就便要取締，也得合理合法的辦，也得信任正當工商業者所組織的團體，取得合作去辦，在這行　開始之手，萬不容許超越法律軌道，橫衝直撞的　幹。惟有官民合作的辦，才可辦得通。先進國家實　管制，組織力量和社會制度遠　於我，辦理時尙須謹愼精細，何况我們的國家？</p>
<p>目前政府官吏對於物價的漲風，以為只要把現行的「非常時期取締日用重要物品國積居奇辦法」實施就得，其實　未免看得太簡單容易了。因爲此項取締囤積居奇辦法的缺點很多，本報前已一再爲文指出。其要點爲：　搆成是項罪行之「大量購存」，其大量二字，過於籠統，不易裁定；　辦理報明·登記·彙報·査核等等手續太繁，各公會及主管機關，限於人力，勢必無從應付；搆成居奇行爲之「抬價超過合法利潤」，以現在物價及各項開支波動過劇，官廳情形隔膜，各項物品之「合法利潤」，實亦無法隨時調整。其他　礙難行之處，尙復不少。而最近政務會議討論本案時，竟以「規定已完密，不必另擬新法，且可省却立法之程序與手續」爲理由，議決以「擬訂實施細則，再送行政院審核」了事，不禁深爲扼腕。大概袞袞諸公，意在貪圖省却立法程序是眞的，若說規定業已完密，恐未必盡然。</p>
<p>此項辦法，原在抗戰期間頒行的，且亦未經立法程序。只以障礙太多，收效甚微，乃於去年二月十七日頒訂經濟緊急措施方案時，重申前令，督促實行。但法令是法令，事實還是事實。據我們所知：儘管官署三令五申，催促遵辦，而本市各業，依法登記報吿的，似乎還沒有聽到，更談不到糾正檢舉，與調査査核。而且，照本辦法第五條，主管官署先須將應行取締物品之種類名稱公吿，以本市工廠商店之多，主管官署人手之少，公告以後，　償全來登記，又將如何應付？此中原因，除了上文所舉道三大缺點以外，還有許多障礙與疑問，試分別條舉於下：以供檢討。</p>
<p>代理買費，並無眞實買賣貨主問題；按照第三條，　亦是構成　積罪據之一。我們不明白，旣無買主，又無賣主，這筆買賣，如何竟會成立？上海各業，幾乎沒有一業沒有　客，亦即無一　無代理買費。此等　客，儘管經人指摘，說他們是亦即無一　無代理買賣。此等銷客，儘管經人指摘，說他們是第三者，是剝削階級，是虛設行號，但立法院通過的法律並無明文取締，相反地，在現行商業登記法第三條中，且把居間業，行紀業，和代辦業，明白列舉在內，而其他亦沒有掮客絕對不許自做買賣的禁令。那麽，這項條款，顯然是說不通的。</p>
<p>市銷售問題　不應市銷售，加上「抬價超過合法利潤」，即構成居奇行爲。同辦法第十一條，並有「不得拒絕出售」的約束，其用意自在推動買賣，以達到取締囤積居奇的目的。但除零售的行莊以外，一般貨主之貨物，大都儲在倉　，並沒有公開陳列。縱使一律登記報吿，一般買戶，何從確知其存有此項貨品？更何從斷定其即屬「不應市銷售」或「拒絕出售」？倘以已經登記，儘可先行査閱爲詞，則中國式的官暑，是否准許任何買戶隨時可向主管官署調閱翻査，亦是疑問。且准許査閱，又有何種條文可資依據？至於統收統購的物品，則更無應市價銷售之可能，雙將何從適用本辦法？</p>
<p>依限出售問題　辦法第八·第十·第十一·第十二等四條，均有依限出售之明文。姑不問其所定限期究竟如何，但貨物的銷售，到底要　胃口（需要）的。有許多地方，還更有帮口，季節和種別的拘束。其在目前限制貨款，限制內匯的狀態下，買戶的銀根，尤其成問題。倘使限期出售，而竟無受主，或胃口太狹，無法承銷，爾時如何限令出售？我們亦明知照第十第十二等條規定，主管官署得勒令運往指定地點出售，得代爲出售，得交該業公會代售，得由管理物資或平價供銷機關收買。但在市面不景氣時，除非眞正大放　，削本賤賣，否則要一律出淸　貨，其實也非易事。而且辦法中却又時提及到所謂合法利潤，似乎並不一定要他們虧本賤賣；在商人　令依限出售時，主管官署更似乎沒有權力强令商人折本賤賣，致捐害了貨主合法的利益，則限內售不出時，始終是個問題。</p>
<p>或謂管理物資與平價供銷機關，諒非民營性質，當不難　款收買。却不知非民營機關之資力，亦自有其限度。試親自備外匯的無證進口貨，其收購須用存單，而且必須分期撥付，足可佐證。有許多出口貨無法推銷，各該業屢次續請收買，亦終以無此預算為詞，未予照辦，又是一佐證。即使國家增發鉅額鈔票，　款担任收費，而此鉅額鈔票發行後，其於取締囤積居奇，抑平物價的原意是否相符，顯然又是問題。</p>
<p>報明報告登記查核問題。第八第九兩條規定，在本法施行前，無論本業或非本業商人，均應將存貨報明銷售，並由同業公會考核報告；第十三條更規定，在本法施行後，本業商人於購進貨物時，應每次向同業公會登記，出售時並應報告，公會則接月呈報主管官署查核。手績如此麻煩，在商人，在公會，在官署，是否有如許人員應付此事，姑不具論。而在每批貨物，每筆交易，經過上述各種報明·報吿·登記·彙報等手續以後，最終却又不過以査核兩字輕輕了此一重公案，頭重脚輕，似亦頗够耐人思維。因爲最後只付査核，似乎用不着上述許多麻煩手續，而且亦無從取締囤積居奇。如果　要取締非法的囤積居奇，則此査核工夫，又顯然還嫌不够。試問業內與業外所報如許貨物，及如許進出數字，單從書面上査核一下，難道就能査得其囤積居奇的蹤跡？其漏報·謊報·少報·多報的情弊，又如何能按圖索驥，加以糾正與檢舉？而且以缺乏行政效率的官署，如果要强其所難以辦理此種瑣碎麻煩之事，其結果恐徒然焉官廳多製造些表報的字紙而已！</p>
<p>從以上這幾點看來，此項辦法，政務會議雖認爲「規定已完密，不必另擬新法」，而事實上　張太甚，確有重新考慮，改　更張的必要。因爲實施細則的擬訂，　名思義，不過把施行手續，酌量補充一下，而其本辦法上所具的缺點與困難，已成定案，未必能矯正得過來，於是實施的結果或依然不過收效甚微。政府抑平物價的初心，豈是如此？</p>

<p>根據貝文外相新計劃　英閣檢討外交政策　將增强與美聯繫對抗蘇聯　　〔中央社倫敦八日電〕英內閣今日上午由首相艾德禮主席，舉行長時間會議，討論國際情勢轉變中之將來英國之外交政策。外相貝文已滿　出席，向會議提出二項機密報告，以供內閣討論。唐寗街雖未發表正式聲明，但悉貝文所提之二項文件，其一係檢討上月倫敦外長會議失敗後之一般國際情勢，其二爲　列將來英國之外交政策。僉料一月廿三日下院辯論外交問題時，艾總體及貝文均將就外交政策發表重要性之聲明。　　〔合衆社倫敦八日電〕英外相貝文今日向內閣提出對全世界外交政策之修正計劃，其中包括美蘇在世界利益衝突之各地點在內。此項計劃如被正式通過，即係工黨政府完全放棄美蘇間維持調解均衡，完全走向支持美國政策之謂。英外交　家自十二月十五日四外長會議宣吿破裂以後，即從事草擬新計劃，此事迄今極端保持秘密。但英高級官員方面消息稱，該劃包括西方列强與蘇聯遭遇之世界每一部分之政策在內。消息靈通方面相信，該計劃包括下列各點：　　　「對德政策」英將以各種方法與美合作，爲此英將努力遵守波茨坦協定之範圍，　致蘇聯有所藉口。　「對希政策」英爲維持希政府防止共黨之壓力及解放希臘起見，將與美國密切聯　，以便希政府更能代表整千希臘人民。英國可能在必要時，增援其在希尙未撤退之五千駐軍，雖此事即使引起左翼工黨之激烈反對，亦所不惜。　「對中東政策」英將以各種方法，建立其地位對抗蘇聯，英並將在其對巴勒斯坦委任統治於本年五月十五日結束時，設法消　阿猶重大衝突。　「對西歐政策」英在馬歇爾計劃中，決心担任一要角，但詳細計劃尙不能擬定，須至美國會之紛歧態度澄淸以後。　「對遠東政策」英國對於日本及其和約問題，將追隨於美國政策之後。英未來對德政策　努力促進全德經濟統一四强協議之門依然示閉　　〔路透社倫敦九日電〕可靠方面息：貝文外相已於九日向內閣提出倫敦外長會議失敗之經過及其對於英國未來對德政策之效果之詳細報吿。英閣之審査對德政策，適在德境英美當局於昨日宣布西德自治措施之後，故內閣於審査之際，必須計及因英美區行政權之集中弗蘭克福所將引起之局勢。蘇聯方面對於英美昨所宣布西德所措施之反響，充滿批許，塔斯社之報吿斥該項建議目的在分解德國，對於德國人民充滿嚴重的後果。貝文前此在下院中報吿外長會議失敗時，曾明示英國決不關閉四强協議之門，預料貝文此次向內閣提出之報吿，仍將以此爲原則。　　外交觀察家僉認目前之中心問題在於蘇聯是否將以西德之新行政措施，作爲脫離柏林盟管會使德國分裂之籍口而定。此間人士認爲蘇聯願意德國分裂者，有下列數點理由：　蘇聯最近在柏林之宣傳，力言西方盟國代表團在盟管會中之期日已屈指可數；　蘇安全當局意欲封閉在柏林之缺口，以使蘇聯已與西德完全隔離；　盛傳蘇聯正加緊準備在蘇聯已建立新行政制度。持相反意見者，則認蘇聯自信其政治勢力可以擴展至西德，故尙不願使德國最後分裂。且蘇聯之宣布欲以外長會議作爲準備對日和約之機構，故料其在柏林盟管會中尙不欲遽即破裂，果爾則英國之對德政策，當不外以下列二途爲引導：　會同美國促進英美合併區之經濟復興，同時給予德人以更大之負責機會，　繼續努力以促進全德經濟之統一。貝文所將建議之最具體措施，爲增加德西部與東部及東歐國家之貿易，並早日成立四區貨幣改革協議。　　西德自治　下月可付諸實施　　〔路透社弗蘭克福八日電〕昨日提出西德政治自治六點建議之美軍總司令克萊將軍今日表示，德方官員對其建議大致均表滿意。渠在記者招待會中謂，渠所提之建議在十天內，可以書面方式提出，以供盟國及德官員研究。渠希望計劃中之若干部，於二月份即能實施。在弗蘭克福開會之德官員已接受增加英美區經濟委會委員人數一倍之建議，並同意由每邦推代表二人，合組立法議會，定名為各邦委負會，對經濟委會所通過之決議，在十四天內得行使表決　。另據英軍總司令羅送　森稱，合併區共同行政機　之設，動機有二：一爲企圖迅速克服聯合佔領之困難；一爲加强英美間之合作。克萊復否認弗蘭克福之決議，乃西德三區合併之先聲，渠力言英美決無使弗蘭克福成爲西德萬都之意，不過爲合併區經濟財政機構總部所在地而已。　　蘇佔領區唱對台戲　　〔路透社柏林八日電〕消息靈通方面稱：蘇聯區各邦總理將於月處在杜林齊亞開會，討論英美所提改組西德英美區行政之　　。又悉，蘇聯主持下的　國人民大會之執委會，亦可望於月底以前成立。一般僉認該德國人民大會乃蘇聯區議會之雛形，而該執委會，可能則爲東德政府之基礎。　　法國向英提出抗議　　〔本報訊〕倫敦九日廣播：巴黎訊，法官方消息，法國對英美在德境佔區成立聯合政治機構一點，提出張硬抗議。並聲明建議中之若干點非法方所歡迎。美參院要求馬歇爾　速提援外總數額　陶格拉斯主張援歐應作贈與　　〔中央社華盛頓八日電〕美參院外委會，今日要求馬歇爾國務卿，儘速向該會提出自今十四月起此後十五個月陸軍佔領費之對外援助全盤費用估計。外委會今日係在結束歐洲復原計劃之審査時提出此項要求。主席范登　要求馬歇爾就國務院所擬要求之下列各項自提出全盤差額表：　歐洲復原計劃（約六十八億美元）　援華計劃。　進一步援希土計劃。　美國在德奧日與朝鮮之佔領費。　　〔路透社華盛頓八日電〕美駐英大使陶格拉斯，八日在參院外委會茲就馬歇爾援歐方案陳述意見，渠認馬歇爾方案內規定之援助，有百分之八十應作爲贈與，在現有之約略估計中，僅百分之二十至四十可作爲需要償遺之借款。陶氏並曰，在援歐之最初十五個月內，拉丁美洲及加拿大供給之援助，價値約六億五千萬元，若彼等不能供給，則美國負担之數額必須增加。陶格拉斯陳辭之先，曾由馬歇爾陳述意見。渠云，歐洲復興計劃若能穩定西歐及西德之經濟局勢，則蘇聯或可依照堪爲西方盟國接受之條件，簽訂對德和約。援歐程序如果堅決，可以使歐洲從事合作，目前尙非決定美國對德最後態度之時，在西德另立政府，目前尙非所宜，但德境法國區將逐漸與英美區樹立密切關係，可能成立英美法合併區，當前亟務在先使西德之局勢得以穩定，相信歐洲復興方案，可建立得以產生協定之局勢，而事實上目前東西歐之間已有濃厚的貿易意議存在。美衆院外委會將審査援歐案　馬歇爾仍將出席作證　　〔中央社華盛頓八日電〕美衆院外交委員會將開會審查美國對戰後整個世界之　原政策，此項政策，並不將限於歐洲。衆院外交委員會係於今日之執行會議中，決定擴大其審査範圍，以包括歐洲以外之世界谷地區，本月十二日馬歇爾出　衆院外委會審查會作證時，歐洲復原計劃，與主張以單獨機構執行援助計劃之赫特法案，該會將首予研究。委員會方面稱，援歐計劃未完成前，關於世界其他部份之計劃，將不予考慮。以去就爭援歐說　馬歇爾否認　　〔本報訊〕紐約九日廣播：華盛頓訊，外傳苟援歐計劃不獲通過，國務卿將提出辭職。今日馬歇爾招待會上加以否認，認爲此種說法完全不確。同時美國駐英大使陶格拉斯今日吿國會謂，關於歐洲，僅兩途可循，一即推行復興計劃，另一即爲「歐洲爲專制政治所征服」，影響所及，將迫使我國大事擴充軍備。茍援歐計劃通過，大致將由陶氏主持其事云。傳蘇向巴基坦建議　訂互不侵犯條約　未批英軍下月撤離印度　　〔路透社成功湖八日電〕傳蘇聯已向巴基斯坦政府建議，與其簽訂互不侵犯條約。記者以此詢英駐聯合國代表培　，議云，尙未見此報吿，惟渠個人認爲互不侵犯條約，乃不甚愉快之名辭，就已往經騐觀，條約之以互不侵犯名者，常引起不愉快的歷史。　　〔路透社孟買八日電〕孟買區軍司領貝特曼少將今日宣稱：如船舶噸位許可的話，未批英軍可於下月底以前撤出印度。貝特曼並透露，現尙留駐印度自治領之英軍，除願在印度陸軍服務者外，有官佐三百名，士兵三千名。美潛水艇五艘　移交土耳其　東地中海美艦隊演習　　〔本報訊〕紐約九日廣播：華盛頓訊，美國刻正以潛水艇五艘，移交予土耳其。此項潛艇，係美國根據一億美元援土法案，所移交予土國十五艘艦艇中之一部份。美國刻正加强地中海區之海軍實力，，今又以潛艇移交土國，殊堪電視。此外，美國復以　托砲艇六艘移交予希臘。　　〔路透社雅典九日電〕美地中海艦隊包括四萬五千噸之航空母艦中途島號及輕巡洋艦三艘驅逐艦若千艘，正在東地巾海及希臘西南之伊沃寗海面舉行訓練演習。傳希共將加入共產集團　美積極軍事援希　期於春末夏初消滅游擊活動　　〔路透社雅典九日電〕希政府所獲情報稱，希臘共黨不久將加入共產國際情報局，貝爾格勒之共產國際情報局曾討論邀請希共參加陔局，以代替承認希臘馬柯斯將軍所頒導「自由希臘政府」之建議。　　〔合衆社雅典八日電〕美駐希使國長里維賽稱，擁有美國槍砲及美國顧問之希臘勁旅，可在春末夏初消滅游擊活動。渠透露稱，二十餘名美軍官已於八日自華府乘專機來希，將在實地研究七天後即赴戰塲。渠明白表示，美軍將在作戰上顧問希軍隊。希陸軍已獲得價値九千六百萬元之美軍配備，今後將更有所獲。　　〔路透社雅典八日電〕英駐希大使諾爾登今日吿知希外長蔡爾違理斯，雅典之英軍總部不久將行撤銷。諾爾登並聲明此乃純粹的行政措施，不致影響英軍在希之實力。　　〔中央社倫敦八日電〕前英首席外交顧問文西泰，今日向英外部提出建識，主張英軍撤離巴勒斯坦後，應即還軍一萬前往希臘。文氏敦促英政府値茲危急之際，不可再有「慕尼黑」事件發生，於必要時並應設法保衛希臘。塔虎脫演說　指責杜魯門　　所有計劃使新政鬼影復活　　〔合衆社華盛頓八日電〕塔虎脫昨日向全國作半小時廣播演說，其中指斥杜魯門以人民之金錢玩弄政治，杜魯門之計劃猶如史達林之五年計劃，將使美國人喪失其大部份之自由，且杜魯門之計劃，將要求美國每年浪費金錢十百億元，此款項當從何而來耶？塔虎脫指斥杜魯門之咨文中，實欲使所有新政之鬼影復活。史達林已死說　傳遍全球　莫斯科保持緘默　　〔路透社倫敦九日電〕史達林已死之說，傳遍歐洲已四十八小時，然莫斯科仍保持極度之緘默。謠言發生於瑞士京城伯爾尼，迅即傳遍全球。伯爾尼日報刊載「史達林已死了嗎」之文·謂史達林已死之說盛傳不已，然世界任何部份之俄人，均尙朱有否認。該報指出過去每發生類似之謠言，蘇聯官方必迫不及待加以否認，而此次則不然。本社巴黎來電稱，該地英大使館　書人亦對此項謠言於傳　金歐後，尙未經官方否認，表示詫異。按上週瑞典癌症專家貝爾文應召飛莫斯科，即傳病者即爲史達林，本週初前巴西駐蘇大使勃朗沃亦在里約熱內盧發表史達林之健康關態至爲嚴重，右半身業已部份麻痺之談話，蘇官方對此等傳說亦均未予置評。義銀行罷工潮可能波及全國　　〔聯合社羅馬九日電〕銀行職工罷工已歷九天，危機今日漸見擴大，共黨或將實行謠傳甚久之全國總罷工。羅馬與米蘭兩地工會昨晚通渦全力爲銀行職工之後　，現正等待總工會命令，然後取具體行動。聯合國巴勒斯坦委會　舉行首次會議　加拿大擬建議組國際軍　　〔本報訊〕紐約九日廣播：成功湖訊，聯合國秘書長賴依今日向負責實施聖地分治計劃之委員會發表演說，力促安理會全力以赴，俾達成此項目的，設有必要，應使用武力。渠認爲使用武力之可能性甚大，除非阿拉伯各國放棄抵抗。　　〔路透社渥太華八日電〕加拿大不久將向安理會建議，主張仿法國外人軍團之方式，組國際志願安全軍，以保護聯合國委員會之安全。美對日棉貸　最近即可簽字　六千萬美元將購買美棉　　〔聯合社紐約八日電〕美國金融界今日消息，紐約花旗銀行，大通銀行，美利堅銀行許洛特銀公司所組織之銀團已與麥帥總部代表商妥，由該銀團以美金六千萬元貸予日本紗廠購買棉花。一俟合約簽字，即可於一星期或十日之內宣布細則。保大準備復辟　成立安南政府　原則上已與法獲協議　　〔聯合社日內瓦九日電〕安南遜王保大之秘書今夜宣稱，保大與法國駐越南特派員波拉特在此談判，關於安南在法蘭西聯邦內改建獨立國事，已在原則上成立協議，並商定由保大為安南臨時政府元首，雙方定於明日繼續談判，波拉特並擬飛往巴黎與法政府磋商。保大亦準備復辟，惟須以統一及獨立爲條件。所謂統一係指北　交趾及安南聯合而言，惟何時及如何成立新政府則尙未決定。　　〔路透社日內瓦九日電〕法駐越高級專員波拉爾，在此與安南遜王保大舉行兩日晤談畢，已於今日返巴黎，渠定週一再來日內瓦繼續與保大晤談。日皇裕仁絕技足使外人捧腹　脚趾夾扇水中撐傘　　〔聯合社東京八日電〕英文日本時報今日載文，提到投降以來日皇裕仁的私生活，莊諧並作，使外國人爲之捧腹，日本人啼笑皆非。據說：「日皇有一技之

<p>雅龍江畔　夷族女王  楊代帝論政　　〔本報成都五日航訊〕川西南邊區，在川　汁三角地帶，金沙江自西東流，　合北來南向的雅龍，安寗，會通三江，構成縱深峽谷。在這峯　起伏，澗谷縱橫的神秘之區，全是川康　夷的天地。百萬夷胞在那裏　息活動，經營原始的農業社會，由土司統制着若干部落，現在操縱　百萬　夷原始政權的，是號稱「夷族女王」的雷波長官司楊代帝，過去由於交通閉塞，文化落後，限制了千年來夷胞進步，但今年大選的民主浪潮，衝破了對建落伍藩籬，換起了夷胞民主意　，使這位世襲千餘年的女長官司，敝　女工尊榮，不惜千里跋涉，來內地參加川省邊民立委競選。　　夷族女王　世襲土司千年　　這位號稱「夷族女王」的女土司，是川西南百萬倮夷的最高統治者，有近千年的煊赫世襲歷史，管轄近二萬方公里的廣大地區。她的祖先從元季開始拓土，始建醫馬諸縣，近世對於安定大小凉山，甚著功勳，（淸代的有名夷族領袖，如楊金石，（封揚成將軍），楊忠廷，（封雷威軍統領），均其祖先），她從國立邊疆學校畢業後，執敎國立凉山小學，近年始就任雷波千萬貫長官司，不特是夷族社會的最高統治者，也是靑年夷胞中最開明的進步份子。她聲明此次競選立委目的：「因爲本身是國民黨員與靑年團員，對於主義拳拳服　，認爲救中國，必談國內各民族聯合一致，平等地實行三民主義。政府應該本　國父「國內民族一律平等」的原則，給予邊民以同等參政機會，所以才本此信念，代表百萬夷胞，爭取立法權利，參加立委競選。　　漢夷一家　政治地位平等　　從管　夷胞的立塲與觀點，他說到今後治理夷務的　結。她認為首要謀反漢夷的精誠合作，而今天漢夷敵視的原因：一是智　程度懸殊，二是接近機會過少，三是語文互相隔閡，四是習尙各有不同。同時，夷族的社會組織是原始農業社會，大多數夷人生活過於貧苦，因而發生作奸犯科種種不良現象，也是招致漢人輕視夷人的不要原因。　　以夷族統治者的土司資格，如何促使漢夷融合，她以實際行政經驗要求政府：第一，從事邊務工作人員，應選賢與能，力求廉能熱忱，尤應多派對邊區有興趣，對夷情有認識的靑年幹部，到邊區工作。第二，治理邊務法令規章應求公與平，力謀切合實際，尤應根據夷胞心理，期其簡便易行，且樂爲夷胞擁戴的來製訂　　夷族自身　爭求改善進步　　關於夷族自身應求的生活改善與進步，作爲夷族知識靑年的她，認爲：第一，夷胞應該接受先進民族領導，促進邊區建設，增進民族地位，表現邊民力量。第二，接受科學知識，廢除不合理習尙，改善不文明生活，用普及敎育求全族夷人的智識進步。第三，擁護政府一切法令，貢獻本族一切力量，用戮力戡亂建國的表現，來爭取邊民平等地位。　　重視邊區　未開發的實庫　　最後，她特別强調聲明：在國內高談建設第一的今天，夷區是未開發的　庫，川諺說：「打開雷馬屛，世上無窮人」。西南邊區，面積近五萬方公里，人口逾二百萬，同時氣候類熱帶，雨量　沛，出產富饒。河谷低處，遍產水稻，崇山高地森林茂密，礦產富有銅，鐵，煤。以如此豐富的人力物力，委　於地，不加　用，實在是國家損失；所以她願意代表邊民，大聲疾呼，要求內地人士：「重視邊區」，「開發邊區」。　　這次邊民立委競選，另一西康候選人是今年與她新婚不久的　部宣撫司嶺光電，川康夷胞切望由他們伉儷的合作，替苦難數千年的夷族，創造新的生活之路。（本報記者周學端）嶺光電楊代帝伉儷合影（本報記者周學端寄）台北破獲販毒案主犯周羣落網　　〔本報台北九日電〕市警局入日晚破獲販毒案主販汕頭人周羣才，往返港　台，專營販毒生涯，其方法為　　毒品於蘋果體內前後已偸運二進餘兩。杭州破獲販毒機關　　〔本報杭州八日訊〕杭刑警總隊，於七日上午在城站搜査得一大規模之販毒機關抄獲烟土，白粉葚　據悉此案簽連葚廣，並有人供給鉅額費金，現已將主犯及嫌疑犯緝獲，嚴加　詢中，不日當可眞相大白。浙省建設年　各綫公路年內全部修復　　〔中央社杭州九日電〕浙省定今年爲建設年，計劃公路部份：　戰時破壞各綫公路，年內全部修復。　改善現已通車之各綫公路。　盡量與築新　綫，尤以　為中心。鄕長殺人判死刑　　〔本報杭州八日訊〕上午年轟動一時之由南館鄉長劉震亞，　仇槍殺居民王永繼一案，經死者家屬王永鳳，控於合肥地方法院，將劉逮捕拘押，業於六日下午宣判，劉處死刑，　奪公權終身。　閩公路調整票價　　〔本報福州九日電〕閩各綫公路票價，十一日起調整，每公里自一千六百元至四千元。福州米貴挿曲　學生一名逼成瘋狂　　〔本報福州九日電〕　市米價狂漲聲中，第一高等工校林姓學生，因家庭經濟斷絕，突告瘋　，沿街逢人便拖，聲言彼習航空機械，欲至義序機塲，親自駕機，並謂願離此米貴地區。聞者酸鼻。故都無聊靑年　硬要看白戲　冒傳總司令甥名義憲兵盤查拘案嚴辦　　〔本報北平九日電〕　傅作義形成北方首要新聞人物，昨有一李姓靑年自稱係傳總司令之甥强欲進入影院，白看電影，憲兵向渠盤査，渠態度極强積，並謂渠即住於傳公館內。憲兵旋以電話詢問，傅氏否認有此外甥，並令嚴辦，此靑年遂被捉將官裏去。　　溝橋多年失修，昨被一卡車壓折，乘客一人被壓斃。東太源兩菜船覆沒船夫八名慘遭滅頂　　〔本報蘇州七日訊〕六日下午，東太湖中有菜船二艘，被風浪傾覆，船夫八名均滅頂。當時西山班輸曾駛經該處，因風狂浪暴，無法施救，旋經報由胥口水　隊出發營救，亦未有所獲。軍糧船押運兵開槍擊斃船女　　〔本報武進七日訊〕聯勤直屬監護一營三連士兵劉方胡，七日押運三十三兵站糧船一艘，由西倉橋開往火軍站，經土龍嘴時，河道擁擠，該押運兵呼喝威嚇前面讓擋，並舉槍射擊。一彈飛出，當將茅柴船上少女來王擊斃彈由太陽穴穿進。出事後，附近人民報醫，當將該士兵拿獲，連同三八式步槍一支，子彈四三發，一併　解城防部核辨。該士兵供認係謀殺事主方面傷心非凡，要求嚴刑懲兇。周隆庠逆產候査　　〔本報無鍚八日訊〕邑人周隆序，係南鄉周新鎭人，抗戰期間，勾結敵僞，出任僞行政院秘書長，勝利後，經當局逮捕，解送首都高院，判處無期徒刑，所有周之逆產，計揚東鄉平田十七畝，城內塔坊橋房屋一幢，業經本邑地檢處査封在案，惟以周逆逆產，恐有隱匿之處，當由馬首席檢察官票傳周逆胞弟周增庠到庭偵訊，結果庭諭交五千萬書面保及二家殷實舖保保釋聽候核辦。無錫劇盜張石泉　判無期徒刑　　〔本報無錫八日訊〕劇盜張石泉，係蘇北東台人，年三十四歲，在敵偽期間，曾人本邑犯案被補，由偽法院判處有期徒刑十年，迨勝利後大赦出獄，詎於上年二月問，又夥同江阿香，倪炳泉二人，在城廂內外連　攔刧行人判處無期徒刑，槪專公權終身。鎭海將設魚市塲　四明山擬築公路　　〔本報杭州九日電〕　驚整後，浙省沿海漁產極旺，寗波魚市場茲以業務擴展，擬在鎭海設立分場，現鎮海方面已早請農林部，經核准單獨設立魚市塲。浙省府建廳爲劃分兩塲業務，以免糾紛，定甘六日召集雙方代表來杭協商。四明山股匪，近頃寶擾山鄉殊烈，該區綏靖指揮部，決動員鄧，慈，餘，奉，上，嵊等入縣，聯合圍剿，並限二月內案成通往山中心之公路六條，以便清剿。皖省擴編保安團　籌借經費五一九四億　　〔本報蕪湖九日電〕皖省奉令擴編保安團六團，並設旅部四個，需經費五一九四億元。皖省府決定由米捐一〇八〇億，煤礦附加一千億，田賦帶征三升，値兩百億，香烟附加四百億，營業稅附加四百億，另呼籲商人捐獻一四〇〇億，餩就原保安經費籌措，期以此項地方武力確保皖境安全。救濟糧百噸運南通　　〔本報南通九日電〕蘇省王主席頃電此間四區專署，以准社會部發救濟食糧一百噸，由　運通，飭懸妥愼接管，靜候指示處理。袖珍新聞　　蘇州　　〔本報訊〕常熟土紳張際　曹叔　等，近發起捐贈沙田予在鄕軍人，慷慨解囊，頃由上海師管區司令部電本縣團管區嘉獎，並將轉請國防部核獎。又：吳縣參議會議長嚴欣淇，頃開始　譯美國名著「行憲文獻」，預定二三月間即譯成出版。按：嚴氏係菲列賓大學法學士。　　杭州　　〔本報訊〕社會部濟　，曾提二百億元，依各省災情輕重，爲支配之根據，茲悉：浙省已獲得五億元，其分配標準，亦依據社會部地區大小，人口多寡等原則，分配各縣發放。　　六安　　〔本報訊〕陳縣政，三截於茲，近聞有倦　意，已向省府簽請辭議者數次，均經省府迭電慰留，最近可望打銷辭意。修正遺產稅法草案全文（上接二版）　　第四章　征課程序　　第十五條　被繼承人死亡遺有財產者，遺產繼承人，受贈人，遺產管理人，或遺囑執行人，應於繼承開始之日起兩個月內，將死亡事實及遺產淸册，向被繼承人住所地遺產稅稽征機關報吿之，其國內無住所者，向原籍地或遺產所在地稽征機關報吿之。　　第十六條　遺產稅稽征機關接到遺產淸册申報後，應於一個月內進行調査估計，決定征免，其合於納稅票標準者，應將核定稅額通知納稅義務人，於一個月內一次繳納，但有正當理由，經遺產稅稽征機關核准者，得分期繳納之，惟最長不得超過三個月。　　第十七條　凡在規定期限自動一次報繳遺產稅者，准予减除應納稅額十分之二。　　第十八條　納稅義務人或利害關係人，不服第十六條之決定時，得於接到査定通知霄十五日內，先繳應納稅款三分之一後，向遺產稽征機關申請覆査，遺產稅稽征機關於接到申請覆査書十五日內覆査決定之，不依上項決定期限繳納稅額三分之一者，其申請覆査權歸於消滅。　　第十九條　納稅義務人或利害關係人，不服覆査決定時，得於接到覆査決定書三十日內依法提起訴願。　　第二十條　經覆査訴願決定後，遺產稅稽征機關應依其決定之稅額爲退稅或補稅。　　第廿一條　納稅義務八繳納稅款後，遺產稅稽征機關應發給繳納遺產稅證書，其合於本法第四條免稅規定者，並發給免稅證書。　　第五章　罰則　　第廿二條　違反本法第十五絛之規定，怠不申報，其逾限一個月以內者，處以應納稅額十分之一之罰鍰，逾限二個月以內者，處以應納稅額十分之二之罰鍰，逾限三個月以內者，處以應納稅額十分之三之罰鍰，逾限三個月以上者，以全部　匿遺產論。　　第廿三條　意圖减免稅額而爲全部或部分隱匿遺產之行爲經遺產稅稽征機關調査屬實者，處以所隱稅額一倍至三倍之罰鍰。　　第廿四條　遺產稅稽征機關所送達之查定通知書或　續款書納稅義務人，如拒絕接受者，得處以起稅點百分之二以上百分之十以下之罰鍰，連犯者並得連罰，違抗遺產稅稽征機關檢査與遺產有關之簿據者，得照本條前項之規定處罰。　　第廿五條　意圖逃稅，不使用本名取得贈與或分析之財產者，除照補稅額外，處一年以下有期徒刑，併處以所漏稅額一倍至三倍之罰鍰。　　第廿六條　違反本法第七條之規定，不提供其應納遺產稅之同等金額或確定之担保者，除追繳其應納稅額外，並處以應納稅額一倍至二倍之罰鍰。　　第廿七條　串通僞造被繼承人生前未償之債務文件希圖逃稅者，處一年以上五年以下之有期徒刑，其受益人併處以所漏稅額一倍至三倍之罰鍰。　　第廿八條　依規定期限及核定分期繳納之稅款，應按期繳納國庫，逾期不繳者，依左列標準分別處罰：　　一，逾限在一個月以內者，處以所欠稅額十分之一之罰鍰。　　二，逾限在二個月以內者，處以所欠稅額十分之二之罰鍰。　　三，逾限在三個月以內者，處以所欠稅額十分之三之罰鍰超過三個月者，除處以罰鍰外，並扣押其財產强制執行。　　第廿九條　本法第廿二條至第廿八條各項處罰，由法院以裁定行之，對於前項裁定，得於五日內抗吿，但不得再抗吿，法院得酌定期限，命受罰人繳納罰　，及滯納稅款逾期不繳者强制執行時，應就易於變賣之財產，確先拍賣其不動產，經二次拍賣而無人承受者，即照最後所估價格抵繳稅款及罰鍰。　　第六章　附則　　第卅一絛　本法規定之起稅點，每年一月七日按主計處所編物價指數調整一次，其調整之起稅點由財政部擬訂，呈請行政院核定之。　　前項起稅點之調整，以前一次調整之日爲調整起算日期，以調整起算日期至每次請整前爲調整期間，第一次調整以本法公布之日爲調整起算日期。　　第卅二條　本法施行細則分估價辦法，不動產抵繳稅款及撥辦法，由財政部擬證，呈請行政院核定之。　　第卅三條　本法自公布日施行。</p>

的原因，是家庭制度複雜，社食生活困難，疾病繼身痛苦，和其他一切環境的逼迫，至於死的方法和應用的器材物品，決不是自殺的原因自殺的罪惡。　　　　用「來沙而」自殺的痛苦不痛苦，在筆考者自己，是沒有體驗過的，并且在上面說過，自殺的時候，大都沒人計較到痛苦和不痛苦的問題。這裏更不用我沒經驗過的人來多喙，不過，照藥學上的原理來推想，牠的腐蝕性，是非常强烈的，化學上的關係，我們不需要在這裏　　，單就牠純粹的濃度而論，從口一直到胃，可以說到一處爛（腐蝕）一處，你不信的話，試用純粹的「來沙而」澆在一塊豬肉上，你便可見牠起怎樣變化了，我們同是血肉之軀，你想有怎樣的感覺，略可推而知之。　　最後，筆者還要講自殺的器材物品，隨處都有，禁，決不是辦法，便要禁也禁不盡。上海人有句俗語說：「黃浦沒有蓋的」，我說，便是塡塞了黃浦，還有海呢。大家都知道消毒藥的普遍問題，是衛生行政上重要目的之一，那麼，禁售「來沙而」却免不了一个近视者幻想，因噎廢食的政策吧。　　守淵按：對於市民周某建議請衛生當局禁止直接出售來沙而，以防自殺，確有此一案，提交參議會衛生小組會討論。惟在討論該案時，並未照案通過，而以直接出售市民時，可否將來沙而藥液之濃度沖談，以減少其毒性之意見，提供衛生當局參考辦理耳。因該日衛生小組會議時，本人亦曾參加也。至報上所載消息，則頗有出入。本文所論，不能因有以來沙而自殺禁售之意見，所謂因噎廢食，編者自表同意。肺結核病的防禦（一）  余正行　　提起肺結絯病，每個人必都有深刻的印象，這不單在中國社會中成爲一種流行廣泛而最普遍的傳染病，世界各國，亦莫不受其普遍傳染之害。只是各先進國傳染受害的程度和範圍，大爲減少耳。該症因在家庭中，極易感染，故亦爲一强列的家庭病，同時，爲四大慢性民族病的一種。我國人民衛生智識缺乏，生活程度低下，貧病相因爲果；兼因飢饉，災荒，戰爭，及缺乏結核病的防治智識和設備，結核病更乘機滋生，蔓延不息，釀成嚴重至普遍的流行。　　此病在城市，兵營，學校，監獄比　更多。因爲人口　集，環境惡劣，設備簡陋，更加容易蔓延。尤以抗戰時期，社會狀況發生重大變化，各種客觀條件，多易促成肺結核病的流行。茲將重慶沙磁區學生及工人肺結核病檢查結果，列表如后：　　沙磁區學生及工人肺結核檢查結果　　包括疑有結核者，因此所得百分率高　　上表數字，恐較實際爲低。然經八年抗戰，結核病劇增，已　顯然，這是一個極端嚴重的問題。更可慮者，結核病患者與死亡率，均以少壯靑年爲最多，實乃民族健康之致命傷。　　中國每年死於結核病的人數，比較任何災難，任何瘟疫，要厲害些，其所以不彰明令人注意者，因爲結核病是一種慢性病，而且流行普遍，不像急性流行病，限於一時，或是偏於一隅。故每年死於結核病的人數，雖然衆多，却還不甚令人驚駭，此實爲其原因之一，而且結核病種類甚多，非祗肺結核一種，全身各處，均可被其傳染，惟普通人不易辨別。故雖死於結核病，而不知其爲結核，此爲其原因之二。據估計全國患結核病者，約在一千六百萬人以上。以全國人數平均計算，每二十五人中，有患結核病者一人。以時間計算，每一分鍾，全國有三人死於結核病。全國每年因結核病之經濟損失，在三千二百萬億以上。其影響國家人品經濟之　，莫此爲甚。其爲民族健康前途的隱憂和嚴重，實不容易忽視。肺結核病的流行　　肺結核病是與人類相始相終的，其流行幾遍全世界。然肺結核病多發生之都市居民，感染程度較輕，這是由於具有免疫力之故。結核病再發時，僅患慢性肺結核病。反之，如肺結核病少發生地方之黑人小兒，感染性特强。如若移居歐洲，忽然感染肺結核，則其病勢經過極爲迅速。如莫其尼柯佛（Metschmiloff）的南露西亞高原的觀察，在尼露尼斯高原中部的遊牧民族，甚少有結核病流行。其未曾與結核病區域接觸過的子女，轉向阿斯拉肯（Astrakan）受敎育的靑年，多數感受結核，而爲全身結核，迅速而死。高原附近的居民，間與結核病有接觸，則感染慢性肺結核病，少急速而死者。可知結核病流行之廣泛，人類幾無可免受其害者。到成人幾百分之百均曾被其感染。因其流行與社會環境有關，即年齡，性別，種族，亦有密切關係：　　一肺結核與年齡的關係：普通感染肺結核病五歲以內者最多，五到十五歲時較少，十五歲以上又增多，三十歲左右最多。　　二肺結核與性別關係：兒童期男女無大區別。男性五到十五歲時最少，四十五到五十歲最多，五十以後又可減少。女性五歲以內最多，五歲到十歲又減少，二十五歲左右最多，三十歲以後又減少。此或由女性生產，哺乳所致。據統計四十歲以前女比男多，四十至七十男比女多，七十歲以上，女比男多。　　三肺結核與種族的關係：二歲以下小孩所患的結核多系粟粒性結核，或腦膜型結核。此因身體未被結核捍菌傳染以前尙無免疫力，故多發生全身性粟粒結核。即使發生肺結核亦係惡性之乾酪性肺炎。又小孩之淋巴組織抗力脆弱，以十到十五歲時抗力最大，以後又減弱，故小孩（十歲左右）之淋馬腺腫脹，係生理現象，表示能有扣留結核捍菌的能力。待身體有免疫力後，只肺及皮膚對結核菌抗力較小，故成人患肺結核或皮膚結核者較多。　　（未完）</p>

<p>文史漢武帝的「王霸並用」的治術  鄧廣銘　　漢書元帝木　中有一段故事說，元帝柔仁好儒，看到他父親宣帝好用文法吏，好以刑名繩下，大臣楊惲，蓋寬饒等僅因語涉刺　而至遭受到殺身之禍，便於侍燕之頃，從容向宣帝進會說：　　「陛下持刑太深，宜用儒生。　　不料這句話很使宣帝動怒，宣帝便正顏厲色地吿訴他的兒子說：　　「漢家自有制度：本以霸王道雜之。奈何純任德敎，用周政乎？……」　　漢宣帝本人的作風，依照漢書所記，一方面「信賞必罰，綜核名實」，使得「政事文學法理之士，成精其能；」另一方面却又在「講論六藝，超選茂異，而蕭望之，梁丘賀，夏侯勝，韋玄成，嚴彭祖，尹更始以儒術進；劉向，王褒以文章顯；將相則張安世，趙充國……治民則黃霸，王成，襲遂…張敞之屬，皆有功迹，見述於世。」實在是最標準的「王霸並用」的作風。至若宣帝以前，則在高，惠，文，景，武，昭六代當中，求其作風最合於宣帝所說「以霸王道雜之」的，却應當是宣帝的祖父武帝一代。　　一，　　武帝在即位之前，從儒生王　受學，對於儒家所理想化了的五帝之地和三代盛世，自然不勝其憧憬。他所寤寐夢想的，是一個「風流而令行，刑輕而姦改，百姓和樂，政事宣昭，青露降，百榖登，德潤四海，澤臻草木，三光全，寒暑平，受天之站，　鬼神之靈，德澤洋溢，施乎方外，延及羣生」的世界。他不知道這是從來不曾遲到過的理想境界，而只以爲漢興已七十年，而還沒有進到這種至治極美的地步者，乃是由於人事尙有未至，政治之　尙未能盡得其宜之故。　　漢代初年，承秦末長期亂離之後，朝野上下俱欲休息乎無爲，黃老淸靜無爲之學遂成爲當時的學學。文帝好刑名之言，景帝不信任儒生，文帝的竇后更特別好尙黃老之　，故在這幾代当中，儒家一直受着排斥，诸博士具官待问，未有進者。而爲這一般信舉黃老道術的帝王將相所統治了七十年的漢家天下，却還是「陰陽錯　，氛氣充塞，羣生寡遂，黎民未濟，廉恥貿亂，賢不肖渾殽」的局面，這和漢武帝所日夜獨往的古昔盛世相差眞不可以道里計。於是在武帝即位之後，一方面在發着思古的　情，一方面對於政治和社會的現狀　着無限的厭惡和鄙視。一般向來在政治上不得意的儒生們，這時乃全都乘機而起，把政治社會一切不良好的現象全都歸咎於「所　異術，所聞殊方」，主張必須改弦更張，即改制度，更敎化，也即是必須「隆推儒術」，將前此所採行的各項治術一齊推　才行。當武帝即位之初，他的祖母竇老太后還操持大權，對於這次復古更化的運動，曾給以嚴重的打擊，到建元六年（西元前一三五）竇氏去世之後，武帝可以爲所欲爲，這般儒生的主張遂次第見之施行了。　　然而漢武帝是一個極富於浪漫氣質的人，正合於沒黯的那句評語：「內多慾而外施仁義。」他對於儒家所歌頌的太古盛世和那大一統的局面，一往情深，願意闢土地，朝　貊，蒞中國而撫四夷。然而對於儒家所規定的治國平天下的途徑，他却是萬不能規規矩矩地去遵循的。他不能祗正其誼而不謀其利，祇明其道而不計其功。功和利正是漢武帝最後目的之所在。這是漢武帝和儒生間一個　根本的差異點。唯其有此根本的差異，所以表現在武帝的用人施政諸方面的，便全不能不與儒家大異其趣：他不能信用純正的儒生，他不能全部採行儒術。儒生儒學和儒術，只是被他用來作爲裝點塲面，文飾太平的幾件物事。這就以下數事可以格外看得淸楚：　　一，董仲舒的三次對策，很爲武帝所賞識，但後來眞正見之施行的，却只是其中的「改正朔，易服色」以及「諸不在六藝之科，孔子之術者，皆絕其道」數事。而　仲舒也只能爲相於王國，却始終未爲武帝所信用。　　二，公孫弘以儒生應賢良文學之選，也以對策爲武帝所知賞，自「爲舉首，起徒步，數年至宰相，封侯」。這似可表明武帝對儒生的信仰了，然而公孫弘的中爲人，曲學以阿世，希世而用事，他寗肯背棄同僚的約議，以迎合武帝的意旨，却絕不肯面折庭争，稍稍有違於武帝的意見。爲了替武帝的夸誕　縱的行徑解嘲，他甚至不惜侶出「人主病不廣大，人臣病不節儉」的口號。是因爲他隨時都能放棄儒生的立塲，他才得到了武帝的信向，而能作丞相御史達於六年之久的。　　三，當時的一些詞賦之士，如司馬相如，朱買臣，枚　，東方朔一輩人，所爲詞賦最喜歡舖張揚厲，侈陳豪富，夸述盛景，這和武帝的好大喜功，侈張豪放的性情甚相投合，遂先後相繼而受到武帝的寵率，且幾乎對人人都相見恨晚。這輩人大都出入禁中而爲近臣，成了最親信的文學侍從。難則文學侍從在當時政府的組織上並不佔車要的地位，而因其日常「隨侍在側」，且常得與當政大臣論辦，能以義埋之文，使大臣數　，所以在實際上，他們倒眞正具有左右國政的實際作用的人。　　在這樣的一般儒臣和文士們的輔佐影響之下，武帝罷　百家，表章六經，拔　海內　茂。又「興太學，修郊祀，改正朔，定歷數，協音律，作請樂，建封禪，禮百神，紹周後」，以至號令文章，也全都「煥焉可述」。而這一切，便是漢武帝一代屬於王道一方面的全部舉措。在其中，我們却很難找得出有那幾項是和當時的国計民生問題密切關聯着的。　　二，　　以儒生起家，不數年而至於拜相封侯的那位公孫弘先生，他不但善於曲學阿世以希進用，據漢書本傳所載，他原來還是一個「習文法吏事，綠飾以儒術」的人。這就是說，公孫弘在表面上是一個儒生，而骨子裏却是最精通刑名法術的。漢武帝所最信任的這位公孫先生的作風，實際上也最足以代表漢武本人和漢武帝這一代的整個作風。在所有裝點塲面需要虛文的地方，漢武帝都採行了儒家的學說，而在所有與國計民生密切相關的實際政刑的措施上，他却全都是採用的刑名法術之家的治術。儒家那一套「省刑罰，薄賦歛」的主張，到這時已全不在武帝的考量之列了。　　因爲漢初採行黃老的無為政策以與民休息，到武帝即位時候這政策已大收功效：民間已經家給人足，社會上已達到了相當的繁榮，政府裏則也府庫餘財貨，太倉之粟陳陳相因。而在同時，這種無爲主義却也培育成功幾種禍害。其最重要的幾端是：一，對北方的强敵匈奴避免用兵而實行和親政策，而匈奴對於漢家却依舊不斷的施以陵辱。二，文景兩代極力减輕農民的租賦，有時甚至一連豁免十數年，這本是一種惠民之政，却不料所惠及的只是擁有土地的富農，貧民佃地而耕，每年依舊須把收穫物的大半繳納給地主。結果遂使富者愈富而得以大量添購土地，肆行兼併，下民貧弱從此乃更深陷於愁苦境地。三，從戰國以來便已在社會上盛行的游俠風氣，漢代初年也在不受千涉的狀態之下而日益滋長着。這種游俠全是些以武犯禁的亡命之徒，他們和漢廷的外戚大臣和列國的諸侯王互相結託，大臣和侯王們也全都樂意養育着大此的游俠之徒，以充盈自身的力量，甚或藉以和中央政府分庭抗禮。游俠們各成帮系，也各有所擁戴的首領。受擁　的首領們，「馳騖閭　，顯名天下，權行州域，力折公侯」，雖無官職爵位，而却能够「以匹夫之細，竊殺生之權」。這對於一個農業社會常是一些動亂不安的因素，社會常是一些動亂不安的因素，成爲農村的大患，在漢武帝，更把他們認作分裂帝王大權的一種惡勢力，也在切齒痛恨着。　　上述三事的第二事，在武帝以前，已經被儒家的　　認為社會上的一大危機。他所担心的是，一般貧弱農民爲了飢寒交迫而賣掉妻子田宅，走上流亡之途以後，是有發生革命事件的可能的。所以在武帝即位之後，董仲舒也提出了「限民名田，以瞻不足」的對象。但漢武帝對於這一問題的重要性並沒有深切的體認，他並不把它認爲應加醫治的一項病症。他只是心迷月眩於國庫的富足和社會上的表面的繁榮，被引上「內盛耳目之好，外事四夷之功」的路子。他想藉用這富厚的財力和人力，對外興師動衆，完成征服四夷的偉業，對內剷除一切分裂割據的努力，由他一人獨享尊榮。　　武帝要興師動衆，一般民衆却是絕不願意遠離家鄉，拋棄生業而去效命於疆塲的，到這時，武帝便只有　朴敲打以驅迫人民去趨赴事功。及至用兵稍久，倉　府庫皆竭，又只有加重一般人民的負担，那更是人民所不情願接受的，於是而發生了漢言刑法　所記載的情形：　　「微發煩數，百姓貧耗·竊民犯法，酷吏緊斷。姦宄不勝，於是招進張湯，趙禹之屬，條定法令。……其後姦猾巧法，轉相比况，禁網　密。……文書盈於几閣，典者不能綱睹，是以郡國承用者駮。」　　法令定得如此嚴苛，又專用一船酷吏去執行，如義縱，杜周，咸宣等人，專以「鷹擊毛摯爲治」，百姓不得樂其生，遂致「吏民益輕犯法，盜賊滋起」，釀成了武帝晚年整個社會騒亂不安的情况。　　任刑用法到這種地步，漢武帝之與秦始皇，豈不已經沒有何等區別了嗎？　　在懲治游俠的工作上，單就武帝收拾郭解一事便可以看出他的用心之酷烈。郭解是當時最大的游俠首領，當武帝要徙豪富於茂陵時，解雖家貧，卻已在彼徙之列。經大將軍衛再爲之解說且不能免。於旣徙茂陵之後，偶有一人議論郭解的爲人，爲郭解的徒衆所殺，其事郭解並不與知，而公孫弘却偏專說「解雖弗知，此罪甚於解殺之。當大逆無道」。於是郭解不但被殺，而且受到了滅族之禍。從此以後，一般宗室貴戚和藩侯將相再不敢招養游俠，甚至功業炫赫一時的衛靑霍去病，也全都爲之改節。各地的游俠雖並未因此絕跡，却大都一改其向來的面貌和行徑，「逡逡有退讓君子之風」了。　　在禮樂聲容的制作方面，武帝採用了儒家所倡的「王道」，在施政用刑的貿政方面，武帝却完全採用了刑名法術之士的「霸道」。宣帝所說的「以霸王道雜之」，正是指此。　　（三十六年十月五夜於北大公舍）談佛典翻譯文學（下）  周一良　　第三是從歷言史的觀點來看佛典翻譯文學·佛典的體制固然是依照原本，但究是譯成中文，多少要受披譯入的文學的影響。譬如經典裏的　語，不問原文書節如何，大抵魏晋六朝時所　以五言四言爲多，七言極少。而隋唐以後所譯傷語，什九是七言，五言極少，四言簡直看不到了。就用字看來，有當時的語　別的記載中不見，而保存於佛典中者。如佛本行後卷貳出家品「曼火未盛有所燒，當與逆滅莫出後」：卷伍歎定光佛品：「曼佛今未去，唯妹助爲福。」這　而的「曼」字有「趁」的意思。又有一類是外典裏可以找到的語彙，而例子甚少。從佛典中能尋出更多例證的。世說新語惑溺篇說：「賈公闆後妻郭氏酷妒。有男兒名黎民，生載周。充自外還，乳母抱兒在中庭。兒見充喜踊，充就乳母手中嗚之。郭遙望見，謂充愛乳母，即殺之」。「嗚」當然就是吻，這一類的語彙普通載籍不大見，　得世說保存下來。普書卷肆拾買充傳依據世說此條，而改作「充就而拊之」。想避俗就雅，殊失本意。竺法護譯生經裏的佛說舅甥經數用此字，如「有嗚噈者」，「因而嗚之」，「授餅乃嗚」。可知六朝時這是很普通的話了。還有一類是現代口語裏的語彙能在佛典中找出同樣的用法，證明它有很久遠的歷史。如現在國語指丈夫「命硬」尅死妻子，或妻子尅死丈夫，謂之爲「妨」（　陰平）。我們在義凈譯根本說一切有部毘奈耶第參拾伍看到一個長者每次娶妻即死，「如是乃至第七妻，悉皆身死。時人並皆喚為妨婦。」又如梵文裏常用的Apica，譯經的人譯成「復次」。自來士大夫作古文雖不用它，嚴又陵　　西洋書却大加借重。直到今天寫文言的人還在用。可是說是翻譯佛典影響中文。　　以上是就語彙講。文注構造方面翻譯佛典也曾有影響。例如助字「於」在先秦兩漢的書裏，沒有用在他動詞與目的格之間的。史記梁孝王世家「上由此怨望於梁王」雖然像他動詞，「怨望於」似與「責望於」用法相同，「梁王」仍非他動詞的目的格。六朝譯經才有這種用法，隨便舉幾個例，如竺法議譯佛　海龍王經：「護於法音」，「見於要」。羅什譯洋義經：「擊於大法鼓」，「供養於請佛」。羅什譯童受喻　論：「得於聖道」。例十不勝枚舉。大約最先是在韵文中凑字數，逐漸在散文莫也流行起來。雖然文人著作裏沒有沿用，唐代變文和　經文裏却教見不鲜，而且變本加厲。第一因爲講經文是敷演佛經，　文也多采取佛典資料，沉浸旣久，自然受它影響。第二因爲民間作家比較自由，不受傳統的拘束，並不認為這個用法有什麼不合，隨意舉幾個例，如八相變文：「見於何物」。降慶變文：「每弘揚於三教」，「好給濟於孤貧」。維　詰經購經文：「側耳專聽於敕命」，「怕於居士」，「爾現於菩薩之相」等等，不一而足，這種用法一直傳到皮簧戲詞裏，如「打駡於他」，「怨恨於我」等。這都是翻譯佛典在研究語文歷史上占重要地位的例子。　　總括上述三點看來，我們可以說：這一大堆嚼過了的飯絕對是有重新咀嚼的價値的！　　（三十六年十二月五日寫竟，記於淸華園之勝因院）魯迅先生遺札　　（一）　　適之先生：　　關於西遊記作者事迹的材料，現在錄奉五紙，可以不必寄還。山陽志遺末段論斷甚誤，大約吳山夫未見長　　人西遊記也。　　昨日偶在直隸官警局買曲苑一部（上海古書流通處石印），內有焦循劇說引茶餘客話說西遊記作者事，亦與山陽志遺所記略同。從前會見商務館排印之茶餘客話，不記有此一條，當是節本，其足本在小方壺　叢書中，然而舍間無之。　　劇說又云，「元人吳昌齡西遊詞與俗所傳西遊記小說小異」，似乎元人本焦循曾見之。旣云「小異」，則大致相同，可推知射陽山人演義，多據　說。又曲苑內之王國維曲錄亦頗有與西遊記相關之名目數種，其一云二郎神鎭齊天大聖，恐是明初之作，在吳之前。　　倘能買得射陽存稿，想當更有貴這之材料，但必甚難耳。明重刻李　娑羅樹碑，原本係射陽山人所藏，其詩又有買得油漬　林　竹題，似此君亦頗好　擦骨　者也。　　同文局印之有關於品花寶鑑考證之寶書，便中希見借一觀。　　樹上　十一年八月十四日　　（二）　　適之先生：　　前回承借我許多書，後來又得來信。哥都大略看過了，現在送還，謝謝。　　大稿已經訖，警闢之至，大快人心！我很希望早日印成，因爲這種歷史的提示，勝於許多空理論。但白話的生長，總當以新靑年主張以後爲大關鍵，因爲態度很平正，若夫以前文豪之偶用白話入詩文者，看起來總覺得和運用「僻典」有同等之精神也。　　現在大稿亦奉還，李伯元八字巳鈔在上方。　　七俠五義的原本爲三俠五義，在北京容易得，最初似乎是木聚珍板，一共四套廿四本。問起北京人來，只知道三俠五義，而南方人却只見有曲園老人的改本，此老實在可謂多此一舉。　　納書楹曲譜中所摘西遊，已經難以想見原本。俗西遊中的思春，不知是甚事。唐三藏中的回回，似乎唐三藏到西夏，一回回先搗亂而後皈依，演義中無此事。只有補遺中的西遊似乎和演義最相近，心猿意馬，花果山，緊箍咒，無不有之。揭缽雖演義所無，但火燄山紅孩兒當即由此化出。楊掌生筆記中會說演西遊，扮女見國王，殆當時尙演此劇，或者即今也可以覓得全曲本子的。　　再西遊中兩提「無支祁」，（一作巫枝祗），蓋元時盛行此故事，作西遊者或亦受此事影響。其根本見太平廣記卷四六七李湯條。　　樹人上　十一年八月二十一日立芬司董—　論歷史和文學　—在教育上之功用  毛子水　　我們如果沒有辨別的能力，我們如果不能把偉大和良善分爲兩件事，歷史的引人入惡和敎人爲善的勢力一樣。　　文學亦是這樣。花卉和野草，長在一起；並且許多花卉，雖然好看，是有毒的。但我們對那些壞文學，亦不能施行删訂或抽燬的工作。要刪除壞文學，和要消滅細菌一樣　是不可能的。我們只可用對付細菌的方法來對付壞文學。那些最壞的，我們只好避開他們；其他的，我們應常把他們的在在和內容警吿大家。我們不能消滅世間的毒菌，我們只好使大家身體强健起來以增加抵抗力。我們呌大家常熟習於上上品的，他們便自然而然的能够看出那些不好的東西來。凡沈酣於莎士比亞作品的人，如果要　Wycherlep　或Don　Juan，我們很可以放心；這樣的人，必有堅定的品節來選取或屏棄的。再者，常看好畫，常喝好酒，常讀好書，常友好人的人，決不會顧到壞　壞酒壞書壞人的！　　如果我們要從文學中得到精神的上上品的啓示，如果我們要用文學來培養我們的德性，我們必須選取那些上上品的，而放棄那些不是上上品的。臂如：聖經中，我們取「以賽亞書」而棄「士師記」；羅馬文學中，我們取Viril而棄Ovid；英國文學中，我們取莎士比亞而棄馬盧，選密爾教而棄康格里夫，選約翰生而棄Sterne，選雪萊而棄拜倫，選Meredith而棄George　Moore，選Bridges而棄Housman。在可取的作家中，我們心中亦應有個分別。我們於古來的偉大作家中，最應注重的是伊司器勒氏（古代希臘最早的悲劇大家），柏拉岡，莎士比亞，位丁等；因爲在所有歐洲人中，他們的取境最高，他們的眼界最遠，他們把人生偉大處顯揚得最好。但這並不是說我們不必讀其他諸人（如康格里夫Housmen等）的書了。技術上的佳美和精神上的佳美完全是兩事。除非「心情的高超」和「精神的偉大」是空話，或者文學和人生毫無關係，不然文學家和政洽家一樣，我們必須用兩種觀點去判斷他們　　以上差不多都是立芬司　書中的說話。因爲本文删削原文處太多，且有改動節序的地方，所以不能說是翻譯。但我相信讀者或可因這篇文字而生讀立氏原書的心。（原書係在劍橋大學出版部出版。）立氏論文學的地方，問有一二點為本文執筆者所未同意的；但就大段來看，立民這本小書，非特教育家所當奉為　果，實在是這個浮　世界的　筏！（續完）</p>

<p>自由談說冬眠  何苦　　這幾天坐在北窗下面寫東西，寒風從窗　裏悄悄吹進來，不免有點感到瑟縮。我初來上海的時候，住在西區一家大公寓裏，窗子朝西，應該在冬夭也是很寒冷的，其時還在「好的舊日子」時代，房間裏裝有水汀，晚問發着嗤嗤的聲音，熱氣　罩全室，居然袪寒有方，不感到寒冷，這樣渡過了一個很舒服的，像然很華貴的冬天。後來，後來當然一年不如一年，水汀爐子燒不起了，後來索性從公寓裹被趕出來，非常狼狽的樣子。　　後來就搬進了這祇有四扇北窗的房部。當時只要有房子住，已經覺得很好，沒有想到過冬天的寒冷，試想不到寒風會從窗縫裏溜進來。這一陣早起作文，便在北窗下的寫字　畔，惟有親身經歷到了，才知道「凍不成書」的力量。我恍比在冬天乘風凉，不過有時可以便你「乘」得涕泗交零的。衡之今日投機家的做法，我的乘風凉也有預先「囤進」的意思，蓋在眼前冬天已在囤進半年之後夏天的「風凉」也。　　這時便要想到　被高臥的樂趣。幼年時候有一副　勁，爲了要戰勝環境，當冬天早晨　覺醒來，硬是要從熱被　中一鼓而起，當時投鞕可以斷流的傻氣，在今日君來，頗為　　。說穿了還不是因爲學校的上課鐘，八時便鐺鐺發聲，不得不一骨碌起身以免遲到而已。其實有熱被窩好睡，誰不想多睡一回。鄉間有個老親戚寫信來說：前幾天最冷的時候，一過晌午，便擁被入睡，眞是得冬眠之　趣者。夫萬百蟲豸，一到冬季，都要多眠，非等驚　節氣到來，不肯出來，可以人而不如蟲豸乎？因此我覺得在冬天擁　窩高臥，眞是人類應享的權利。當年諸葛先生高臥隆中，想來也是不勝寒咸之襲人。當時的諸葛亮，還未受劉玄德三顧，年事尙輕，寒冬擁絮不起，並沒有阻礙他偉大的前程，後來照樣入蜀拜相，可見冬天躱在被窩裏，對於一個人的年齡，一個人的前程，毫無影響。反之，你的遠大計劉，你的高瞻遠矚，都可以在被窩裏打好腹稿—要　飛的人，必先雌伏，「老驥伏　，志在千里」，縮在熱被窩裏，正好佈置下雄謀大略的腹稿也。　　俗話說得好，「一年之計在於春」，春天是你計劃之開始，則冬天當是計劃之結束，應該多多休養生息，躱在熱被　裏休息一下，乃是頗合乎自然的法則。今天晚上趁電車回來，坐在我旁邊的一個中年人，一上車納頭便睡，袖手縮頭，不勝其凄寒的樣子，此時若有人爲他覆上一條棉被，其歡迎正與飢者之獲得麵包相等。等過了三四站路程，我已下車，此人還是昏睡不醒，頗能隨時隨地利用冬眠的機會，假如他在車上擁有一條熱被窩，一定到了終站也不肯下車的吧。　　其實除了人類應該冬眠，人類以外的事物亦應有冬眠的機會。例如我們最歡迎在今日及時冬眠的便是物價—寫到這裏，家風又在窗縫裏鑽入，決心從明天起不再早起，一定要縮在被窩裏，不受北窗對我的冷眼相待了。花的替身  如意　　在好萊塢，不但明星們都有替身，連花都有替身的。因爲攝影塲上強烈的水銀燈溫度很高，普通鮮花在燈光下祗幾分鐘就會萎謝，所以每次開拍之前，必須預備大量外形極相似的鮮花，隨時更換。　　紙花早就過時了，因爲新式的錄音器極度銳敏，如果演員的衣服擦着紙花的時候，立刻會留下極淸晰而難聽的沙沙之聲，好像有一只貓爬進了字紙簍去一般。專家意見  而比　　英國細菌學專家威廉·賽無忌爵士說：「菜碟洗滌之後，與其用布擦乾，不如任其自然，讓它自己陰乾，比較起來衛生得多。」　　美國家禽科學協會會長査理·何普說：「默察今日的雌鷄，大有日見貪獺之趨勢。」（註：蛋生得愈來愈少也。）　　紐約愛德溫·達爾堡牧師說：「人類要謀互相了解，不如先設法易地以處。響如說，每個醫生何妨自己諸人家來開一次刀，每個警察何妨坐幾個月牢，每個大資本家也何妨加入工會，領導一次罷工？」　　美國伊渥瓦州居民加里柴里斯，以康健著名全美，年紀八十八歲，猶有弄璋之喜。人家問他健康之道如何，他說：「若要身體好，祗須多吃紅辣椒。」（譯自紐約先　論壞報）中心篇  史郁　　行行出狀元是一句老話。並不是行行出了狀元才有這一句話，實在是有了這一句話才行行出了狀元。「狀元」向我們點頭，我們追隨着「狀元」，人生就是那麽會事。羅素（Brtrand　Russet）的妙語：「你若是大政治家之流，你的範圍是廣大的，你自然可以大有作爲；你若是小商人之流，你的範圍是狹小的，你自然可以小有作爲。無論如何，你總可以有所作爲。」即是將行行出狀元這句話近代化了。學徒辛勞半生，無非想做個老　；讀書人十載寒窗，無非想戴頂紅纓帽兒。這自然也是老話，但新式人未嘗不是這個樣兒。無論大圈圈也好，小圈圈也好，誰不想在自己的圈子裏做個中心人物？　　先從家庭說起：大兒子常常是圈子裏曇花一現的中心人物。初獲麟兒，那有不寶貝之理；等到二兒子一出世，這個中心人物便不得不讓給兄弟了。大兒子心有不甘，國牆之爭由是而起。譬如少吃半塊餅乾等等。小兒子往往是圈子裏最後的中心人物，因爲他較多與父母接近。祗有他有最多坐父母膝蓋的機會。假如你有四個兄弟，二個姊妹，這個膝蓋之爭就顯得複雜了。但愈複雜，你就愈多經騐。有人說獨生子的悲哀，即在於缺乏此種膝蓋之爭的訓練。這話好像有點眞理。　　學校內的中心之爭是最顯見的。實際說來，考試制度的歷久未衰，即建築在這一個基礎上。小少爺是可能不關心分數的，因爲他已是學校時髦派的中心人物；一般的學生想做個中心人物，就必須在學業上發展了。某大學有全系僅二十人者，平時感情的融治，好如家人一樣，但每當「表顯」的時候，中心之爭畢露。每個人肚子裏都有一套邏輯，誰都想將自己的　　到他人。而世界也就這樣的在進步着。　　「我不要什麼中心，我已熄滅了我生命的火花！」老年人說一句話，可以不借火柴；靑年人說這一句話，就得請他再劃一根火柴了！西樓題像  任天　　王磐，字鴻漸，別號西樓，明高郵人，精繪事，尤工詞曲，構樓城西，著有西樓樂府。先生詞名爲畫名所掩，世人祇知其畫籃之饒有神韻，而不知其吐詞之尤爲淸新流麗也。「露筋曉月」爲高郵八景之一，相傳映於水中之月，即先　所　而　於水中者，此則傳者故神其說，未必眞有其事也。又高郵諺語有云：「王西樓嫁女，　（借用作話）多銀子少」，或近事實，蓋先生恬淡自甘，不慕榮利，饒有靖節風味，嫁女　資必無多也。　　先生　自題其畫像云：「捲之一握，放之儼然，子孫賢，多掛幾年，子孫不賢，不値半文錢，西樓可憐，西樓可憐」！造語自然，不加雕琢，立意尤有風一趣。　　高郵城內西市橋旁有茶社，舊名西樓，余幼時曾隨長者往其處品茗，相傳即先生故居。考之高郵志乘，先生所築之西樓在城之西偏，而西市橋則近於城中。城西一帶，滄桑幾易，早成一片瓦礫邱墟，西樓舊址，恐湮沒已久，無復可供後人憑弔矣。秦檜之妻賢德  鄭過宜　　西湖岳忠武王墓前　有秦檜王氏，張浚万俟卨四鐵像，反接而跪。遊者輒向之溲溺，以快意洩憤，一吐不平之氣，所謂「誅奸回於旣死」，意固甚善。然舍王貴王俊而列王氏張浚，似有未允。蓋岳飛之死，非王俊首其罪，王貴執張憲送於樞密行府取勘，不能成此寃獄。（事詳載三朝北盟會編及建炎以來藥年要錄）張浚特晚年主和議，與秦檜意合，且力助罷諸大帥兵　之謀，以保祿固寵耳，其實微張浚，飛亦死也。　　至土氏則尤無顯著過惡可書，後人所以罪狀之者，僅宋人說部嘗有東窗事犯一語，然事涉隱微，不足置信，私室密語，究孰聞而洩之？其爲當時之人深懸秦檜，故設此疑似之事，以　毒於其妻孥可知，然則王氏惟不幸爲秦相之妻，亦何辜之有？岳飛以「莫須有」致死，而王氏之受誣，亦「莫須有」也。吾讀「建炎以來　年要錄」載：「秦檜秉政十八年，當貴且極，老病日侵，將除異己者。故使徐　張扶論趙汾張祁交結事。先捕汾下大理寺，拷掠無全膚，令汾自誣　　浚李光胡寅謀大逆，凡一時賢士五十三人，檜所惡者皆與。」注云：「臣　見前校書郞魏了翁言：在館中時，聞今敷又閣學士吳獵言：秦檜病時，大理寺官以趙汾等獄案上省。檜夫人王氏却之，語家吏曰：太師病勢如此，且休將這般文字來激惱他。如此者再三。檢死，事遂已。故以檜之惡如此，而其子孫未盡滅絕，蓋王氏此舉能全數十家性命故也。臣又　見蜀之老士人有爲薛仲邕館客者言：仲邕時持案續入檢臥內，是時已擬定刑名，只取檜一押。字，會其疾爲乃已。所謂五十三人，趙令衿胡銓注應辰張孝祥之徒皆是也。」秦檜此舉較殺岳飛手段尤狠辣，設非因王氏之阻而止，不特此五十三家性命不全，而一時賢士皆盡，南宋元氣已喪，國將不國，其亡恐不待百年以一後矣。是延南宋　絕之祚者，王氏之力也。魏了翁乃所謂「聖人之徒」，其言宜不妄。史臣以秦檜子孫之未盡滅絕，歸功王氏，蓋深幸張浚等五十三家命懸頃刻，僅而獲免，端賴此耳。王氏有此陰德而人不知，徒取小說無稽之談，使之蒙若干載，是以特表而出之，聊為　洗，亦讀史者之責也。逍遙花  陳慎言　　第六章　禍不單行　（三七）　　顧綺紈率領李曼英，王長春，劉德松各人到達濟南，三天打泡戲，貼出梅派古裝戲，廉錦楓，洛神，生死恨，竟賣滿座，不但備受各界歡迎，綺紈也認爲用梅派號召，最合身份，不想濟南一般顧曲周郞，嘗新祇是一股熱勁，起先幾天，拼命摔塲，看了幾天之後，見老是這一套玩意兒，便有點厭膩了，上座便不似先前那樣踊躍·園主人再三和綺紈商量，改變作風，出一點新噱頭，綺紈只是不肯。恰巧這一天晚上，厭軸是李曼英的碰碑，綺紈的父親，原自命是譚派嫡傳，所以這次綺紈約的二牌老生李曼英，也是譚派的弟子，因爲速日看客漸漸减少，這天爲資號召，特貼出譚門本派的托兆碰碑，這齣戲恰合濟南人脾胃，常晚上座八成，李曼英最先唱的還平平穩穩，沒有什麼疵病，到了反二簧，那拉胡琴的周少如，原是曼英的舅舅，出了花頭，曼英唱到「我的大郞兒」那句，胡琴竟錯了板，拉不出來，急得曼英滿頭大汗，連呌：「哎喲我的舅舅，您這不是要我的命嗎！」台下聽見這一句，通聲四起，立時起座很多，到了大軸綺紈的「鳳還巢」上塲，受了曼英影響，台下觀衆大形　落，綺紈見這情形，心裏非常難過，悶在心裏，勉强完塲，深怕如此一來，要鬧出別的笑話。戲園主人，趁這機會，又再三和綺紈商量，從前吳紅舫去濟南露演「紡棉花」，塲塲滿座，紅極一時，綺紈若肯貼出「紡棉花」，當時就能起滿坐滿。綺紈在未來濟南之前，私下原打算演這一　戲，到濟南之後，覺得自己原打着梅派的頭銜，唱這一類戲，多讓人笑話，氣轉餒了，但是在此情形之下，若不改變作風，再演梅派古裝戲，眼看戲園生意，將每况愈下，若是失敗回去，有何面目見人！斟酌再三，和園主人商量好，貼出鄧霞姑，加一點新噱頭。在綺紈的意思，演鄧霞姑，仍是本門的戲，不想園主人，要挽回頹勢，在戲單傳單上竟印着「顧綺紈小姐跳舞」的字樣，如此一宣傳，果又　動觀衆，那天又賣了滿座，在大家心裏，認爲能看綺紈在台上跳舞，便値得這幾塊錢票價，不想綺紈唱下來，竟沒有跳舞，台下觀衆，那肯甘心，一時譁聲四起，摔茶杯，拍桌子，要求退票，　勢洶洶，行將動武，急得園主人，走頭無路，再三央求綺紈便裝上台，向台下敷衍幾句，以解　園，綺紈在這種情形之下，要想逃避也逃避不了，無可奈何，祗好忍氣吞聲，　答答重到台上，向觀衆賠了幾句話鞠躬道歉。台下一般觀衆，才含笑拍掌而散。歲首論進步  文介　　「讀讀歷史，看看現狀，人類委實不能說有什壓進步；你看，馬路邊的路牌，本來是鐵鉻的，如今一律換成木製的了。」　　「此論未免過激。進步何嘗沒有，只須放遠目光看。比方呢絨　嘰，消毒牛奶，水泥鋼骨的摩天樓；他如汽車，飛機，電燈，電熱，有綫無綫電報電話，派克五十一型墨水筆，雷達，原子能，配尼西林，以及一切醫藥上的新治療法等等，不勝枚舉。難道古時有道些的？這些景非目可見手可觸的進步？你說沒有進步，何所見而云然？」　　「比方說，文童方面：不由衷胡說一通的那一類，姑置勿論。就說今日最好文章，其好亦猶古時文章之好，初不比古時更好。古之論語孟子，莊子墨子，老子韓非等等，今日讀來仍感新鮮可喜，並不覺得陳腐。今日有許多話，實是前人早已說過了的：講民主，孟子比今人更民主；講法治，韓非比今人更法治。以今人之文與古人較，總覺今人說來說去仍是這一套，未能越出那一個圈子。今日有些好文章好議論，無非從蛛網麽封的古紙堆裏搜了出來的老話，只是攪和了一下，另外貼上了一張新鮮悅目的標籤而已。太陽之下無新事，此語至少可適用於古今文章。」　　「誠然。像中國這類空論式的文字是不會右進步的。不過文字本身本無所謂進步不巡步，文字只是工具，還須看其內容。文章進舟與否須視其所說事物是否進步。說的是老話，雖則換了幾個字，自然還只能算老文章，如果說的是新事新物，那便是進步的文章了。事物日新月異，評述日新月異之事物的文章，春本身即便日新月異，是即文　的進步。換言之，記述雷達，消毒牛奶，配尼西林等等的文章便是進步的文章，像西洋雜誌里的文章，春所以引人入勝，就是這個道理。即以古書論，古昔刻竹爲書，後來總算用太板了，以與今日一小時可印報紙若干萬份的印刷機較，覺無進步？我看現代的鉛印書定比什麽宋　善本好。宋板之所以受人珍視，無非往昔印刷簡陋，印得惡劣的書多，宋板比別的板本稍許精美罷了。復次，古人爲了印刷簡陋，所以古書經轉輾傳刻，內容自然舛錯百出，字句常有缺落，魚魯之誤更所難免。經後來學者訓詁考校，這些古盡讀本便比從前容易懂得了。這也是一種進步。」　　「把古書考校訂正一下就算進步，這點恐未必然。須知古書本來並無舛鉛缺乏，只是經戰亂散失，遂使古　有了缺陷，學者的考訂工作只是儘可能使其回復原狀罷了。你說進步，敢是經胡適之考校過的墨子要好過古昔第一版的墨子了？其次，你把日新月異和進步混做一談，實則新奇的東西未必即是好東西，原子彈即是一例。今人殺了人還要進一步支解屍體，新奇固然新奇了，可是在殘忍一點上，與古時鞭屍或五馬分屍無何不同。何况有些事只是循環，不是進步，如四季；有些事只能算變化，不是進化，如年齡。人長了一歲，是變化了，是否進步却難說，要不怎麼一人成了衰翁便不能有所爲了呢？你如此崇尙西洋新奇事物，敢問玩橋牌是否定比下棋爲高雅？反之，洋人打麻將豈也可算進步？又如把西洋書譯爲中文，或中國書譯成西文，這些只算變易，不是進步，因爲只把原物變動一下，初無將原物變得更好之處。復次，若新奇即是進步，那末今人又何必讀古人盡？」　　「是不然。第一，把西書譯爲華文，或把中國書譯成西文，這却是十足的進步，不祗是變易而已。例如赫勃·傑爾士以英文譯了莊子，在吾人看雖只是變易，在英語民族看，却是他們文化中新加了一種好東西，故在他們是進步。如果我們把法文的雨果著悲慘世界譯爲中文，在法人看只是變易，在我們的立塲言，却是我們文化中新添了一種好東西，故在我們是進步。第二，關於今人　古人書一點，可以如此說；文化是累積的；古人已知之事物，我們何必重新自行去學習呢？今人讀古書，目的在溫故而知新，庶可在古人累積下來的文化上建造更新更好的文化，是即靑出於藍之意。」　　「那末請間我們讀了千百年孔孟之盡，何以讀到了如今却是人人的靈魂成了問題，而竟讀不出半個孔孟來呢？」　　「　舍是。今人之讀古人書，猶愛因斯坦的讀牛頓學說，牛頓學說之於相對論却如藍之於靑，其進步也顯然。」　　「我總覺得什麽相對論原子說電子說宇宙錢等等，在文化方面之功未見，却已無一不與『武化』相關。即以一般科學而論：以我們今日所知的建築科學去造房屋，固足使人人有屋住，以我們今日所知的農業科學去耕種，固足使人人有飯吃，以我們令日所知的紡織科學去織造，固足使人人有衣穿，以我們今日所知的汽車工程去製造汽車，固足使人人可坐汽車，可是今日世界上無數人仍沒飯吃，沒屋住，沒衣穿，沒有汽車坐；雖說是「不爲也，非不能也」之一例，可是若不爲，雖能，何用？余意愛因斯坦及其流總也得熟讀一下孔孟聖賢書，懂一些「何必曰利，亦有仁義而已矣」一類道理，於事始克有濟。記得幼年念論語孟子，認仁義乃理所當然，何足爲奇；心想那還用說嗎？念摩西十誡亦然，反而暗思：人是可殺的？姦敢是可通的？東西敢是可偸的？待年愈長，却愈覺十誡聖賢書可貴，愈覺其新奇，愈覺其行不易。想是幼年不失赤子之心，及年長，離那些標準漸遠—退步了。」　　「余另有看法：今日讀摩西十誡和聖賢書覺其新　可喜，固足示今人之不進步，可是須知前此人是不知十有誡與聖賢書；人之知有十誡與聖賢書，即是人之一大進步。余深信將來終有一天人們會視十　與孔孟所說爲當然，不再認爲新奇，如視牛頓定律然的。換言之，孔子終會有與居利夫人結婚的一天。」社會服務讀者信箱　　宜興縣楊巷區楊巷鎭李堅行等諸君鑒：來稿已轉江蘇省選舉事務所核辦。　　王品槑君鑒：尊函已轉請中央銀行銀答，一俟得復，再行奉　。　　一個滬杭路的旅客鑒：大稿已轉京滬區鐵路管理局，當必有以改善也。　　無錫黃華民君鑒：　國防醫學院分大學及職業兩部：大學部內分醫·藥·牙·護理等四科，職業部內分牙醫，牙藝，營養，理療，衛生檢驗，衛生行政，衛材供應，高級護理等班。　並無助產專科學校。申報徵募寒衣運動　昨順利結束成績美滿　寒衣六百餘件捐款八千餘萬元　　本報發起之徵募寒衣動動，自去歲十二月廿一日開始，迄同月卅一日爲止，前後共歷十日，承讀者熱誠贊助，踊躍輸將，成績可觀。綜計十日內共收到捐款八千〇四十六萬〇五百元，新棉衣一七一套，舊衣褲四一七，　子廿一頂，被絮十條，鞋子六八雙，襪子廿雙。比項寒衣，羣於昨日上午專送交本市冬令救濟委員會　發難胞，捐款部份則撥入該會冬賑捐款項內，充作冬賑之用。</p>

Two other important proposals were also passed: one was the central government's general budget, and the other was the draft method for changing the Construction Special Donation to the Relief Special Donation. In addition, the following three financial proposals were also passed: A. The direct tax on profitable enterprises, which in the past was collected based on the profit amount of the previous year, has now been decided to adopt a pre-payment method starting this year. B. The amount of commodity tax collected, which in the past was evaluated once every three months, has now been changed to be evaluated once a month. C. Local finance will be based on self-sufficiency in this year.</p>
<p>(Our Nanjing Dispatch, 9th) The proposal to designate Beiping as a co-capital was passed at the State Council meeting on the 9th. This proposal was initiated by Gu Mengyu, Speaker of the Beiping Provisional Council, and Xu Huidong, Deputy Speaker, who telegraphed the National Government to instruct the Executive Yuan to review it. After review by the Ministries of Interior and National Defense, it was believed that Beiping, as the former capital of our country, is the hub of politics, military, culture, and transportation in North China. At a time when the country is facing multiple crises and the treacherous bandits are rebelling, the provinces of North China have long suffered from poison, and the people are eagerly looking forward to the central government. Now that Xi'an and Chongqing have been designated as co-capitals, the importance of Beiping is no less than those two places. Therefore, this opinion is put forward, requesting the National Government to adopt it to maintain the morale of the people. It was passed after discussion at the State Council meeting on the 9th. The opinions put forward by the Beiping Council are roughly as follows: A. North China is the birthplace of our Chinese nation, where we can observe the Northeast and threaten the Jiangnan region. B. Beiping controls the iron and steel industry of North China, holding the hub of transportation, materials, and military mobilization in North China, which is the only base for implementing the suppression of the rebellion.</p>

<p>The Significance of Raising Relief Special Donations Lies in Equalizing Social Wealth</p>
<p>Spokesman of the Ministry of Finance Talks to Reporters</p>
<p>(Our Nanjing Dispatch, 9th) The merits and demerits of raising relief special donations will be launched in the short term, and all the proceeds will be used to provide relief to disaster victims. This is the statement made by the spokesman of the Ministry of Finance to reporters after the State Council passed the Relief Special Donation proposal. He also declared that the government will allocate 500 billion yuan as soon as possible for disaster relief funds to cooperate with the donation. Regarding the fundraising of relief special donations, he specifically put forward three major significances to explain it: A. The rich pay to equalize social wealth. B. It can benefit refugees to achieve the purpose of social relief. C. It can be used to promote and show the noble morality of human disaster relief and care. A certain person did not agree with the Ministry of Finance's explanation and said: The Ministry of Finance will fully cooperate with the Ministry of Social Affairs to promote it under the leadership of the chairman of the supervisory committee, and will use various publicity methods when necessary to ensure that this matter can be promoted.</p>
<p>Director Dong Xianguang Talks About the Characteristics of the General Budget Proposal</p>
<p>(Central News Agency, Nanjing, 9th) Director said: The budget proposal passed by the State Council on the 9th has several characteristics. First, after the implementation of constitutional government, the government's policy guidelines may need to be changed to some extent, so this budget is only applicable for half a year. The budget for the second half of the year will be compiled separately by the government reorganized in accordance with the constitution. Second, on the revenue side, various plans for rectifying tax collection, adjusting tax rates, and stepping up the disposal of materials were put forward at the same time to greatly increase the national treasury revenue. After thorough research and careful calculation, the listed revenue numbers are all reliable. The ratio of the total revenue of more than 58 trillion yuan to the total expenditure of 96 trillion yuan for the regular and special parts is 61%, which is quite close to the ratio of the national treasury revenue in the best year of financial situation before the war. Third, on the expenditure side, in addition to the current necessary expenses, which have been approved as proposed, all funds that may occur in the future or may be increased due to price changes have been widely considered, referring to past situations, predicting future trends, and generously estimating and approving a large amount of reserves. Fourth, this budget is divided into ordinary and special parts. All expenses required for general regular finance, business, debt, and regular military preparation are listed as ordinary expenditures. Temporary income such as special tax revenue and property sales are used for downsizing, and the shortfall is raised by other means.</p>
<p>Draft General Rules for Provincial and County Autonomy</p>
<p>Sent to the Legislative Yuan for Review</p>
<p>(Our Nanjing Dispatch, 9th) The draft general rules for provincial and county (city) autonomy were submitted to the National Government after being passed by the political affairs meeting on December 9 last year, and then transferred to the Legal System and Political Affairs Committees for review. The review report was submitted, and the State Council meeting on the morning of the 9th discussed it in detail based on the review report. All the committee members spoke, and finally resolved two points: 1. The item "Completion of land registration in four areas" in Article 6 of the original draft cannot be completed urgently and should be deleted. The other items are in line with the constitution and will be sent to the Legislative Yuan for review. 2. The Executive Yuan will immediately draft various regulations related to provincial and county autonomy, such as election laws at all levels. In order to actively promote autonomy, in view of the current situation in our country, when provincial and county autonomy is implemented, there must be considerable preparation. Therefore, during the preparation stage from the implementation of the constitution to the implementation of provincial and county autonomy, the Executive Yuan will formulate innovation methods for the provincial and county system, the relationship between the provincial and county governments and councils, and the financial revenue and expenditure system. During the meeting, the legislative principles proposed by the Executive Yuan were also put forward and it was decided to send them to the Legislative Yuan for review together.</p>

The agencies themselves will consider how to streamline the organization or downsize the institutions or eliminate redundant personnel. 6. The Executive Yuan will determine the implementation methods of this proposal.</p>
<h3 id="e4">Our Delegation to the United States Next Week <a href="#e4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs Announced the List of Experts Yesterday; American Business Community Launches Aid to China Movement</p>
<p>(Our Nanjing Dispatch, 9th) Regarding the dispatch of a technical delegation to the United States to discuss US aid to China, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs issued the following announcement on the 9th: As a result of discussions between the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the US State Department, the Chinese government is now sending a delegation to Washington to exchange views on issues related to US aid to China. The Chinese government has also appointed former Central Bank Governor Bei Zuyi to lead the delegation, and has also appointed Ministry of Foreign Affairs Advisor Li Gan, Transportation Department Road Administration Division Assistant Hong Shen, Chen Liangfu, Chief Representative of the Syngen Committee's US Representative Office, and monetary expert Zhu Baozhen to assist Bei.</p>
<p>The delegation is scheduled to fly to the United States from Shanghai on the 14th of this month. Li had previously attended the Manila Far East Economic Commission and then traveled to the United States, and Chen was originally in the United States and is now residing in Washington. According to this base delegation, it was originally scheduled to be led by Yu Dawei and Bei Zuyi, but Yu's duties as head of the Ministry of Transportation were too heavy, and his mother was critically ill and unable to leave, so he cancelled the trip. However, according to authoritative sources, Yu may still travel to the United States in the future, but the timing will be when the US aid issue is ripe.</p>
<p>(Central News Agency, Washington, 8th) The US Senate Foreign Relations Committee today asked Secretary of State Marshall to submit an estimate of the cost of the aid to China plan to the congress as soon as possible.</p>
<p>(Associated Press, New York, 8th) Business people with interests in China in the United States decided at a meeting of the US Far East Industrial and Commercial Association on the 8th to launch a large-scale movement in Washington to provide appropriate aid to China immediately. Dr. Kong Xiangxi, former Vice President of the Executive Yuan of China, then gave a speech to more than 600 members and guests. Kong warned: "Our country's resources are now exhausted. If the United States does not provide assistance, our country may experience even greater hardship." Kong attacked the CCP's rebellion, saying: "If the Communist Party only wants political rights, no one can criticize it, but armed rebellion, which damages the integrity of the country militarily, economically, and socially, should be resisted by the government."</p>
<p>US Policy Towards China</p>
<p>The Evolution of the Past Year</p>
<p>(Associated Press, Washington, 9th) This week a year ago, Marshall's mediation of the Chinese civil war failed and he returned home in frustration, issuing a statement of "calamity for both sides," denouncing both the Kuomintang and the Communist Party for obstructing a peaceful resolution. President Truman issued a statement on China policy on December 18, 1946, which Marshall emphasized in his statement, saying that unless Chairman Chiang "expands his government" to accommodate "more liberals," the United States would have no way to aid China.</p>
<p>However, today, as Secretary of State, Marshall is instructing his subordinates to draft a long-term plan for the United States to aid China's reconstruction with US$300 million, as he proposed in November. This explains the evolution of US policy towards China.</p>
<p>After Marshall returned to China on January 7 last year, the official US position was to let the Kuomintang and the Communist Party fight for several months. When they were unable to eat, the opportunity for cooperation between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party to form a coalition government would be ripe. Officials believed that neither the Kuomintang nor the Communist Party was strong enough to achieve a decisive victory, which would inevitably lead to concerns about negotiations. However, they now admit that their estimates were wrong, which benefited the Communist Party. A significant change in the US attitude towards China occurred in July this year, when Truman sent Wedemeyer to China to investigate the situation in order to determine how to aid China. At the same time, the US Congress passed a resolution to provide China with US$27.7 million in relief supplies after the end of the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration. In some respects, the August 24 statement explained that the Wedemeyer statement closed the door to aid to China, but well-informed sources said that the main purpose of the statement was to strengthen Chairman Chiang's power to eradicate certain reactionaries within the Kuomintang. After Wedemeyer returned to Washington, he submitted a report to Truman and Marshall. Because its contents mainly discussed China's weaknesses and the implications of US policy towards China for the Soviet Union, it has not yet been made public. However, the report recommended massive aid to China, including military assistance to Chairman Chiang.</p>
<p>Although the situation in China is extremely complex and opinions vary, at the beginning of the new year, it is clear that the United States has decided to provide aid to China similar to that given to Greece, France, and Italy.</p>

<h3 id="e6">Implementation Measures for the Economic Plan; Draft of the Commercial Part Formulated <a href="#e6" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c6" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">6</a></h3>
<p>Encourage Exports; Trial Run of Barter Trade with Foreign Countries</p>
<p>(Our Nanjing Dispatch, 9th) The draft implementation measures for the commercial part of the economic reform plan have been formulated. The draft has detailed provisions for encouraging exports in domestic and international trade, and conducting trial runs of barter trade with foreign countries. The Full Economic Commission has scheduled a discussion at its regular meeting on the 15th. The main points are recorded as follows: Original Plan 1. Develop domestic trade: Urge enterprises to reoccupy fixed funds and absorb new funds. The exchange of materials in various economic zones in the country should be formulated into a general plan in coordination with transportation, finance, and tax regulations, and put into practice. Strengthen the cooperation and joint operation system for the production and sales of domestic goods. Except for war or other necessities that are stipulated by the central government or approved by the central government, local governments shall not restrict the export of goods or levy special taxes. All agencies and state-owned public goods shall be limited to domestic goods. Foreign goods shall not be transported and sold unless they cannot be produced domestically.</p>
<p>Original Plan 2. Restrict imported goods: The current import and export management system should continue to be implemented. Adopt a barter trade system as much as possible for the raw materials and production tools that must be imported. For similar items that can be manufactured domestically, those that can attack domestic needs are prohibited from import, and those that still need to be supplied with a portion of foreign goods should reduce the import quota as much as possible. Prohibit the import of luxury goods and other unnecessary items, and prohibit their sale on the market within a time limit. Provide as much support as possible for the development of businesses that offset imports.</p>
<p>Original Plan 3. Encourage export business: The principle of foreign exchange incentive management methods should continue to be applied to facilitate export trade, but when necessary, the government can still purchase and guide unified sales to compete for international markets. The joint transportation system for export goods should be strengthened. For export materials, especially specialty products, a regular loan system should be established from production and manufacturing, inland transportation, transshipment, and sales. The handling banks or companies should moderately relax the conditions, simplify the procedures, and formulate preferential methods for packing, widening, exporting, discounting, and insuring export materials. In order to cooperate with the current foreign exchange situation, certain important items should be designated to promote joint import and export methods, such as exchanging cotton yarn and cotton fabrics for cotton, rice, flax, and flax products in Southeast Asia and India, and exchanging tung oil, bristles, and mineral sands for transportation equipment in the United States, and exchanging leather goods, raw silk, and lace embroidery for cotton, wheat, and wheat flour in the United States, and exchanging soybeans, wool, and Taiwan sugar for agricultural equipment in Japan, and exchanging egg products, wool, department stores, bean cake, and soybean oil for chemicals and industrial equipment in Britain.</p>
<p>Original Plan 4. Trial run of barter trade: The National Cooperative Goods Supply and Marketing Office will conduct a trial run of barter trade by national defense cooperative organizations. For export items that belong to agricultural products and animal products, production and marketing cooperatives should be established in the producing areas. For industrial products, cooperative factories or specially-contracted factories should be established. International cooperative organizations can absorb investment in accordance with laws and regulations. When exchanging imported items, if it is necessary to import them first due to seasonal or special reasons, the National Cooperative Goods Supply and Marketing Office can guarantee that items of equal foreign exchange value will be exported within the specified period before being allowed to import. The National Cooperative Goods Supply and Marketing Office can directly apply for import through import and export merchants.</p>
<p>Original Plan 5. Strengthen the organization of guilds: Commercial companies and firms in various places should join the same industry guild. Those who do not join in accordance with the law will be punished. Guilds in various industries should hold meetings on a regular basis and enrich the staff and financial expenses to strengthen the control and investigation and research on members' business operations. Guilds in various industries should formulate common covenants for members to abide by and self-regulate. Formulate laws and regulations on commodity standards and crack down on counterfeit and inferior products. Strengthen the commodity inspection work of the same industry and government agencies. Promote the commercial accounting system and promulgate special laws to bring commercial accounts into line.</p>

Due to insufficient tonnage, airmail (letters, postcards, airmail newspapers) to Lanchow and other places cannot always be cleared. Although the Shanghai-Shaanxi route can be used to forward mail via Shaanxi, air transport from Shaanxi to Dihua is also difficult, hence the slight delay in airmail to Lanchow.</p>

They recently hosted reporters. The performers are mostly children of the righteous army soldiers, and their mothers are mostly from the Uyghur and Tatar ethnic groups. Therefore, the songs and dances are rich in frontier flavor. However, due to the severe winter and prolonged hunger and cold endured with their parents, many are emaciated and listless.

<p>British Cabinet Reviews Foreign Policy Based on Bevin's New Plan; Strengthening Ties with the United States to Confront the Soviet Union. [Central News Agency, London, 8th] The British Cabinet held a lengthy meeting this morning, chaired by Prime Minister Attlee, to discuss Britain's future foreign policy in the changing international situation. Foreign Secretary Bevin, fully recovered, attended and presented two confidential reports for the Cabinet's discussion. Although Downing Street did not issue a formal statement, it is understood that one of the two documents presented by Bevin was a review of the general international situation following the failure of last month's London Foreign Ministers' Conference, and the other [omitted character] outlined Britain's future foreign policy. It is expected that Attlee and Bevin will both make important statements on foreign policy during the foreign policy debate in the House of Commons on January 23.</p>
<p>[United Press, London, 8th] British Foreign Secretary Bevin presented a revised plan for global foreign policy to the Cabinet today, including areas where the interests of the United States and the Soviet Union conflict around the world. If this plan is formally adopted, it will mean that the Labor government has completely abandoned maintaining a mediating balance between the United States and the Soviet Union and has fully embraced supporting United States policy. British diplomats have been drafting a new plan since the breakdown of the Four Foreign Ministers' Conference on December 15. This matter has been kept extremely secret until now. However, sources in the senior British officialdom say that the plan includes policies for every part of the world where the Western powers encounter the Soviet Union. Well-informed sources believe that the plan includes the following points:</p>
<p>"German Policy" Britain will cooperate with the United States in every way. To this end, Britain will strive to abide by the scope of the Potsdam Agreement in order to avoid giving the Soviet Union any excuse.</p>
<p>"Greek Policy" In order to maintain the Greek government, prevent communist pressure, and liberate Greece, Britain will maintain close ties with the United States so that the Greek government can better represent the entire Greek people. Britain may, if necessary, reinforce its 5,000 troops that have not yet withdrawn from Greece, even if this provokes fierce opposition from the left wing of the Labor Party.</p>
<p>"Middle East Policy" Britain will strengthen its position in every way to counter the Soviet Union. Britain will also seek to mitigate major conflicts between Arabs and Jews when its mandate over Palestine ends on May 15 of this year.</p>
<p>"Western European Policy" Britain is determined to play a key role in the Marshall Plan, but detailed plans cannot be drawn up until the divided attitude of the United States Congress is clarified.</p>
<p>"Far East Policy" Britain will follow the policy of the United States on Japan and its peace treaty.</p>
<p>Britain's Future German Policy: Efforts to Promote the Economic Unity of All of Germany; the Door to Four-Power Agreement Remains Open. [Reuters, London, 9th] Reliable sources say: Foreign Secretary Bevin presented the Cabinet with a detailed report on the failure of the London Foreign Ministers' Conference on the 9th and its effects on Britain's future German policy. The British Cabinet's examination of German policy comes at a time when the British and American authorities in Germany announced measures for West German autonomy yesterday. Therefore, the Cabinet must take into account the situation that will be caused by the concentration of administrative power in the British and American zones in Frankfurt during the examination. The Soviet response to the measures for West Germany announced by the British and Americans yesterday is full of criticism. TASS reports denounced the proposal as aiming to disintegrate Germany and full of serious consequences for the German people. Bevin stated clearly in the House of Commons when reporting on the failure of the Foreign Ministers' Conference that Britain would never close the door to a four-power agreement. It is expected that Bevin's report to the Cabinet will still take this as its principle.</p>
<p>Diplomatic observers all believe that the central question at present is whether the Soviet Union will use the new administrative measures in West Germany as an excuse to withdraw from the Berlin Allied Control Council and split Germany. Sources here believe that there are several reasons why the Soviet Union might be willing to split Germany:</p>
<p>The Soviet Union's recent propaganda in Berlin vigorously asserts that the days of the Western Allied delegations in the Allied Control Council are numbered;</p>
<p>The Soviet security authorities intend to close the gap in Berlin in order to completely isolate the Soviet Union from West Germany;</p>
<p>It is rumored that the Soviet Union is stepping up preparations to establish a new administrative system in the Soviet zone.</p>
<p>Those who hold the opposite view believe that the Soviet Union is confident that its political power can be extended to West Germany, so it is still unwilling to finally split Germany. Moreover, the Soviet Union has announced that it wants to use the Foreign Ministers' Conference as an institution to prepare for the peace treaty with Japan, so it is expected that it will not want to break up the Berlin Allied Control Council soon. If this is the case, then Britain's German policy will be guided by the following two paths:</p>
<p>Cooperate with the United States to promote the economic recovery of the British-American merged zone, while giving Germans greater opportunities to take responsibility;</p>
<p>Continue to work to promote the economic unity of all of Germany.</p>
<p>The most concrete measures that Bevin will propose are to increase trade between western Germany and eastern Germany and Eastern European countries, and to reach an agreement on currency reform in the four zones as soon as possible.</p>
<p>West German Autonomy Can Be Implemented Next Month. [Reuters, Frankfurt, 8th] General Clay, Commander-in-Chief of the United States Army, who presented the six-point proposal for political autonomy in West Germany yesterday, said today that German officials are generally satisfied with his proposal. He said at a press conference that the proposal he put forward could be submitted in writing within ten days for study by Allied and German officials. He hopes that some parts of the plan can be implemented in February. German officials meeting in Frankfurt have accepted the proposal to double the number of members of the Anglo-American Economic Commission and agreed that each state should send two representatives to form a legislative assembly, called the State Council, which may exercise its right to vote on resolutions passed by the Economic Commission within fourteen days [omitted character]. According to British Commander-in-Chief Robertson [omitted character] Sen said that the establishment of a joint administrative body in the merged zone was motivated by two factors: first, to attempt to quickly overcome the difficulties of joint occupation; second, to strengthen cooperation between Britain and the United States. Clay also denied that the Frankfurt resolution was the prelude to the merger of the three zones of West Germany. He forcefully argued that Britain and the United States had no intention of making Frankfurt the capital of West Germany, but only the headquarters of the economic and financial institutions of the merged zone.</p>
<p>The Soviet Occupation Zone Sings a Counter-Tune. [Reuters, Berlin, 8th] Well-informed sources say: The prime ministers of the states in the Soviet zone will meet in Thuringia at the beginning of the month to discuss the [omitted character] of the reorganization of the administration of the Anglo-American zone in West Germany proposed by Britain and the United States. It is also learned that the executive committee of the [omitted character] National Congress of the German People under the auspices of the Soviet Union is also expected to be established before the end of the month. It is generally believed that the German National Congress of the People is the prototype of the Soviet zone parliament, and the executive committee may be the foundation of the East German government.</p>
<p>France Protests to England. [Our News] London 9th Broadcast: Paris News, French Official News, France made hard protest against the establishment of a joint political institution by British and the United States in the German occupation zone. And declared that some point in the suggestion were not welcomed by the French side.</p>
<p>US Senate asks Marshall to quickly submit the total amount of foreign aid; Douglas advocates that aid to Europe should be given as a gift. [Central News Agency, Washington, 8th] The US Senate Foreign Relations Committee today asked Secretary of State Marshall to submit to the committee as soon as possible an estimate of the total cost of foreign aid, from this day fourteen months to the next fifteen months, including the cost of the army's occupation. The Foreign Relations Committee made this request today at the end of its review of the European Recovery Program. Chairman Vandenberg asked Marshall to submit a complete table of differences for the following items requested by the State Department:</p>
<p>European Recovery Program (approximately US$6.8 billion)</p>
<p>Aid to China Program.</p>
<p>Further Aid to Greece and Turkey Program.</p>
<p>US Occupation Costs in Germany, Austria, Japan and Korea.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 8th] The US Ambassador to Britain, Douglas, stated his views on the Marshall Plan for aid to Europe to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee on the 8th. He believes that 80% of the aid stipulated in the Marshall Plan should be given as gifts. In the current rough estimate, only 20% to 40% can be used as loans requiring repayment. Douglas also said that in the first fifteen months of aid to Europe, the aid provided by Latin America and Canada will be worth approximately US$650 million. If they cannot provide it, the amount borne by the United States must be increased. Marshall presented his views before Douglas's presentation. He said that if the European Recovery Plan can stabilize the economic situation in Western Europe and West Germany, the Soviet Union may sign a peace treaty with Germany in accordance with conditions acceptable to the Western Allies. If the aid to Europe process is firm, it can enable Europe to engage in cooperation. It is not yet time to determine the United States' final attitude towards Germany. Establishing another government in West Germany is not appropriate at this time, but the French zone in Germany will gradually establish close relations with the Anglo-American zone, and it is possible to establish an Anglo-American-French merged zone. The current urgent task is to first stabilize the situation in West Germany. It is believed that the European Recovery Program can establish a situation that can produce an agreement, and in fact, there is already a strong trade agreement between Eastern and Western Europe.</p>
<p>US House Foreign Affairs Committee will review the Aid to Europe case; Marshall will still attend to testify. [Central News Agency, Washington, 8th] The US House Foreign Affairs Committee will meet to review the United States' [omitted character] original policy towards the entire world after the war. This policy will not be limited to Europe. The House Foreign Affairs Committee decided to expand its scope of review in today's executive meeting to include regions of the world other than Europe. When Marshall appears before the House Foreign Affairs Committee hearing on the 12th of this month to testify, the European Recovery Program and the Hurt Act, which advocates that a separate agency implement the aid program, will be studied first by the committee. The committee said that plans for other parts of the world will not be considered until the Aid to Europe program is completed.</p>
<p>Regarding the rumor of resigning over the debate on Aid to Europe, Marshall denied it. [Our News] New York 9th Broadcast: Washington News, rumor says that if the Aid to Europe plan is not approved, the Secretary of State will resign. Marshall denied this at today's reception, believing that this statement is completely untrue. At the same time, the US Ambassador to Britain, Douglas, told Congress today that there are only two paths to follow regarding Europe. One is to implement the recovery plan, and the other is for "Europe to be conquered by totalitarian politics." The impact will force our country to greatly expand its military equipment. If the Aid to Europe plan is approved, it will likely be presided over by Douglas Yun.</p>
<p>Rumor says that the Soviet Union proposed to Pakistan to sign a non-aggression treaty. Unconfirmed British troops to withdraw from India next month. [Reuters, Success Lake, 8th] It is rumored that the Soviet Union has proposed to the Pakistani government to sign a non-aggression treaty with it.

<p>North and South Markets Dump White Rice, Grain Trading Gradually Normalizes. Authorities Resolve to Severely Punish Rice Merchants Who Raise Prices.</p>
<p>[Our Report] In response to the rising rice prices of recent days, the authorities decided to adopt a policy to suppress prices. Yesterday, the North and South Rice Market Management Committees each supplied 7,500 piculs of rice to the market, priced at 1.35 million yuan per picul, for a total of 15,000 piculs. This rice was all high-quality Wuxi, Changshu, Kunshan white japonica thin paddy. The market atmosphere eased considerably, and grain trading gradually normalized. Yesterday, the registered arrivals of grain in the North and South markets, when transacted, all complied with the authorities' regulations, not exceeding the maximum price of 1.35 million yuan within seven days.</p>
<p>Another report: Yesterday, the retail price of rice still reached around 1.55 million yuan in some rice shops. According to the prescribed retail price, it should be the market price plus 6% legal profit, and about 30,000 yuan for cartage and commission per dan, so each dan should only sell for about 1.46 million yuan. The authorities, after investigating these rice shops that raise prices, have decided to severely punish them. Furthermore, on the 8th, the North Market arbitrarily raised the rice price to 1.5 million yuan for transactions. The Social Affairs Bureau has dispatched personnel to investigate and found that three rice shops purchased at high prices on the morning of the 8th and then raised prices for sale, with each shop transacting hundreds of dan, causing chaos in the market on the 8th. The Social Affairs Bureau has confirmed the facts, and Director Wu has decided to severely punish them according to the Regulations for Suppressing Rebellion.</p>
<p>The China Trading Bureau ordered 43,000 tons of rice last year, which has been arriving at ports since the middle of last month.

Expected to arrive within days are the Changxing vessel carrying 7,000 tons and the Manila vessel carrying 1,000 tons. The remaining amount has also been arranged for transportation by ships and is expected to arrive completely within the month. Flour Digestion Is Smooth; Oil Market Supply Increases.</p>
<p>Yesterday, a total of over 11,800 piculs of rice and grain arrived in the North and South markets. Grain market transactions were extremely sparse, with only white yuan indica rice seeing some activity. The market trend was not very volatile. Flour digestion was very good, and prices rose again by 20,000 yuan. Wheat bran sales turned sluggish, trending towards flatness. Bean cake factories remained firm, continuing to rise by over 10,000 yuan. Soybean buyers, both oil factories and others, were receptive, and sellers held firm, rising gradually by 10,000 to 20,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Mung beans were competitively purchased by both North and South merchants, soaring upwards, galloping by 100,000 yuan. Adzuki beans arrived insufficiently to meet sales, skyrocketing by 50,000 to 60,000 yuan. Cowpeas saw active buyer interest, surging by over 100,000 yuan. Broad beans arrived sparsely and sold briskly, galloping by 100,000 yuan. Red sorghum was stable in the north, with distilleries not eager, maintaining a firm tone.</p>
<p>Corn, under the aggressive acquisition in Qingdao, saw another sharp increase of 30,000 to 50,000 yuan. Raw peanuts were aggressively sought by Guang merchants, and local streets followed suit, continuing to surge wildly, reaching new peaks, a dramatic increase of over 100,000 yuan. Sesame also rose with other commodities, with black sesame adding 5 yuan and white sesame soaring by 100,000 yuan.</p>
<p>The oil market saw increased supply from factories, maintaining balance. Soybean oil was initially firm but then weakened, showing a slight softening. Raw oil saw tightening at collection time, with Ningbo merchants inquiring, rising by 20,000 to 30,000 yuan. Clear oil was flat, while vegetable and sesame oil added slightly by 30,000 to 40,000 yuan. Flour Association Requests Implementation of Wheat Loans and Import of One Million Tons of Foreign Wheat.</p>
<p>The Flour Industry Association of the Four Districts, due to the sharp rise in flour prices following rice prices and the depleted wheat reserves in producing areas, and with the equipment of flour mills in various districts mostly unable to be fully utilized, has provided opinions to the National Economic Council, requesting adoption to improve the current environment. The following is a summary:</p>
<p>Raw Materials: The flour industry, with factories in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui provinces alone, has an annual output of 70 million bags, requiring approximately 2.4 million tons of wheat annually. According to pre-war domestic wheat production, 1.5 million tons of raw materials could be supplied, sufficient for only seven months of production, requiring imports of foreign wheat to make up the shortfall. However, at that time, the national food supply was barely adequate. After the war, due to local unrest, high fertilizer costs, and transportation obstacles, production declined. This year's wheat, available for purchase, is no more than 600,000 tons, sufficient for only three and a half months. Wheat typically enters the market in its peak season from July to September. By the end of December this year, the quantity purchased by various factories (including the Grain Department) was only over 300,000 tons. Except for a portion stored by the Grain Department, factories, due to financial constraints, milled as they purchased, with little storage. To stabilize the people's food supply, the government should comprehensively plan and find ways to import one million tons of foreign wheat.</p>
<p>Capital: The flour industry's financial foundation was destroyed during the Anti-Japanese War. After the victory, to cooperate with the government's food policy, businesses did not have operational freedom, and 18 companies were unable to sustain themselves and closed. The main reason was the inability to obtain loans. Even with loans, it was ineffective. The government should implement a wheat loan program, increasing capital by at least 160 billion national currency, so that each factory can purchase 500,000 dan of wheat to supplement the people's food supply.</p>
<p>Production: According to the Association's statistics for 1946, the annual output was approximately 17 million bags. According to machine equipment, the annual output could be 70 million bags. Currently, the output is less than one-fourth of the total production capacity. Furthermore, the peak production periods for each factory are mostly from July to October, which is also the peak season for wheat entering the market. After this, it gradually decreases. Currently, due to insufficient raw materials, insufficient electricity, and insufficient capital, the peak season cannot produce large quantities, and the off-season is even more difficult to sustain. The Association's survey in August of this year showed that the highest output for each factory was only 3 million bags. The peak season is only this much. The future is self-evident. The authorities should set a policy early to ensure the people's food supply.</p>
<p>Government Bonds Rise Again, Foreign Stocks Turn Weak.</p>
<p>Government bonds created another miracle yesterday. The Unified C bonds opened at 49,500 yuan in the morning, rising from 48,400 yuan to a new high of 52,600 yuan, before settling slightly. 5 million yuan was traded. Compared to the previous close, A and B bonds rose by 3,000 yuan, C bonds rose by 4,800 yuan, and D and E bonds each rose by 400 yuan.</p>
<p>Four Types of Government Bonds to Be Drawn for Redemption.</p>
<p>The Ministry of Finance has scheduled a lottery for redemption of four types of government bonds at 10:00 AM today at the China Trust Bureau, 4th Floor, 74 Renji Road. These include the 24th redemption of the 1936 National Rehabilitation Bonds, the 13th redemption of the 2nd issue of the 1939 National Construction Bonds, the 10th redemption of the 1941 Military Supply Bonds, and the 2nd redemption of the 1st issue of the 1947 US Dollar Bonds.</p>
<p>Foreign Stocks Initially Rose, Then Weakened. Hong Kong and Shanghai Electric first shrank to 2.4 yuan, then rose to 2.8 yuan. The environment weakened again. Ewo Silk fell from a new high of 710,000 yuan, declining to 620,000 yuan at closing. Securities firms initially rose, then sold. Foreign merchants bought. Compared to the previous close, Tramway and Telephone were stable, Paper fell by 10%, Wheelock, Real Estate, Ewo Brewery, Steel, and Rubber each fell by 0.5%, and the rest declined slightly.</p>
<p>Investigation of Returned Checks Proves Effective; Same-Day Use of Checks Will Be Strictly Prohibited. The Shanghai Financial Management Bureau of the Ministry of Finance, to thoroughly eliminate speculation, has dispatched a large number of auditors since yesterday to conduct a comprehensive inspection of the operations of banks and trading houses, especially focusing on investigating returned checks and prohibiting same-day use of checks. It is reported that both have been effective, and the number of returns has indeed decreased. The latter will be strictly enforced and punished according to law, in the hope of suppressing prices and stabilizing finance in the shortest possible time.</p>
<p>China Trust Issues Notice to Purchase Imported Paper.</p>
<p>The issue of purchasing imported paper with self-provided foreign exchange has been finalized. The China Trust Bureau has prepared for the purchasing work. The Bureau has issued a notice to paper importers to handle the purchase. Furthermore, paper prices in the city have soared. For example, newsprint was 1.4 million yuan per ream on Monday this week and over 2 million yuan yesterday. Heavyweight woodfree paper was 80,000 yuan per pound on Monday this week and is now 130,000 yuan, all soaring sharply, greatly affecting cultural undertakings. After the purchase is completed, the authorities will sell to increase market supply and suppress prices.</p>
<p>Cotton Merchants Have Mostly Registered; China Textile Construction Will Purchase According to Market Price. The Yarn Control Committee Holds Its First Committee Meeting.</p>
<p>[Our Report] The Yarn Control Committee is scheduled to hold its first committee meeting at 3:00 PM today (the 10th), chaired by Chairman Yuan, with all committee members and directors attending. The Committee received an order from the Ministry of Economic Affairs yesterday, adding Gu Baochang, Director of the Industrial Affairs Department, and Dai Dajun, Director of the Control Department, as members of the Committee, bringing the total to seven, sufficient to meet the required number. It is reported that the meeting today will discuss the implementation rules for various management items and the organizational regulations for offices in various locations.</p>
<p>Furthermore, according to Chairman Yuan yesterday, regarding cotton registration, almost all cotton merchants in the city have registered. The Committee has notified China Textile Construction Corporation that it can purchase cotton according to market price from today. The required funds have been transferred to China Textile, and cotton merchants can directly contact China Textile. In the future, the Committee can purchase cotton whenever cotton merchants bring it to the city. He hopes that cotton merchants and factories will sincerely cooperate with the Committee so that all matters can be resolved.</p>
<p>[Another Report] According to Deputy General Manager Wu of China Textile Construction Corporation, the Company has not yet received an official document from the Yarn Control Committee entrusting the Company to purchase registered cotton from cotton merchants. The purchase funds have also not been transferred. However, it is believed that it will be transferred within a day or two, and the purchase will then be handled. The purchase price will be determined by the Yarn Control Committee. China Textile is responsible for inspecting cotton samples, grading them, and then purchasing them at the verified market price.</p>
<p>Cotton Yarn Negotiated Prices Adjusted Again; 20s Yarn Changed to 35.5 Million Yuan. Yarn Control Continues to Sell in the Market Yesterday.</p>
<p>[Our Report] The Yarn Control Committee adjusted the negotiated prices of cotton yarn again yesterday, with 20s yarn changed to 35.5 million yuan. Other counts of yarn were set proportionally and with reference to market prices. The Committee continued to sell cotton yarn in the market yesterday. 110 applicants applied to purchase 619 lots. As a result, 68 applicants were approved to purchase 350 lots, equivalent to 460 lots of 20s yarn. The selling price for 20s Heavenly Maiden Golden Rooster was 38.1 million yuan, Flying Boat 37 million yuan, Golden Double Horse Three Sails Double Happiness 36.8 million yuan, Golden Ingot Red Bee 36.5 million yuan, 6s Deputy Sunlight 16.5 million yuan, 32s Blue Phoenix 49 million yuan, 40s 58 million yuan, and 42s Double Strand 63 million yuan.</p>
<p>Furthermore, China Textile Construction Corporation also sold yarn as usual yesterday, selling a total of 1,241 lots, equivalent to 2,066 lots of 20s yarn. A total of 531 applicants applied, and the selling price remained unchanged.</p>
<p>Cotton Cloth Market Weakens Again.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the cotton yarn market weakened because of the excessive rise in recent days, with buyers taking a wait-and-see approach. Speculators profited and sold, and the market showed oversupply. Prices frequently declined. Finally, the price of 40s Blue Phoenix fine yarn fell by 2.35 million yuan compared to the previous day. Other counts of coarse and fine yarn also declined, ranging from 400,000 to 2 million yuan.</p>
<p>The cotton cloth market opened with uncertainty due to rumors of a ban on the movement of yarn and cloth. Furthermore, China Textile Construction Corporation supplied a large quantity the day before, and funds were ample. Some firms experienced tight positions, and there was a lot of reselling in the market. In addition, speculators sold high-priced goods, and buyers also came to settle accounts. Dyeing factories countered by selling. By the end of the day, the price of fine cloth such as Dragon Head Five Blessings fell by 80,000 to 100,000 yuan compared to the previous day. Throughout the day, raw blue cloth and native-spun cloth were firm and strong due to increased dye and labor costs. Other cloths seemed to be flat and weak.</p>
<p>The current cotton market, since the announcement of the unified purchase and distribution method by the Flower, Yarn, and Cloth Management Committee, has been marked by doubt and reluctance to trade on both sides, and the market has been stagnant for a long time. After days of negotiation between cotton merchants and the authorities, cotton is still allowed to move freely in the city, so the same industry transaction revived, slightly has the business. Yesterday Market price (Sima scale) transaction price was 7 million yuan per dan, Hankou fine velvet 6.5 million yuan, and there was no news of other transactions.</p>
<p>Crackdown on Nylon Stockings Decided to Start with Registration.</p>
<p>[Our Report] After the victory, foreign nylon stockings sold well in the city, severely impacting the domestic industry. Relevant industries petitioned the authorities to ban sales to seek salvation. The Municipal Government's Second Economic Conference decided to have the Social Affairs Bureau invite the Municipal Chamber of Commerce to discuss concrete measures. Zhou Weixin, Chief of the Price Management Section of the Social Affairs Bureau, and Yan Mingsheng, Secretary-General of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, exchanged views at 10:00 AM on the 8th and agreed on three measures:</p>
<p>The scope of prohibited goods is very broad, but nylon stockings will be the initial target.</p>
<p>The Social Affairs Bureau will draft a stock registration form (including name, quantity in stock, cost, current selling price, monthly sales for the past six months, etc., without investigating the source) and order relevant industry associations to complete registration within one month and report to the Social Affairs Bureau for verification.</p>
<p>Selling prices, sales deadlines, and the handling of unsold goods within the deadline will be determined by the Social Affairs Bureau after convening the Municipal Chamber of Commerce and relevant industry associations. The above measures have been reported to the Municipal Government and approved for compliance.</p>
<p>Control of Market Interest Rates Must Be Adapted to Local Conditions.</p>
<p>[Our Report] It is reported that the Federation of Money Trade Associations, when convening its inaugural meeting in Beijing, passed a proposal from the Shanghai Money Trade Association, namely that the control of interest rates should consider the financial market conditions in various regions and adapt to local conditions to bring them closer to market interest rates. The meeting also requested the Ministry of Finance to forward a request to the Central Bank to notify its branches in various locations to adopt and implement this. The Ministry of Finance, citing that the "Regulations for the Management of Bank Deposit Interest Rates" stipulate that interbank lending rates and loan interest rates in various regions should be drafted by the local banking and money industry associations and then finally approved by the local branches of the Central Bank, which is consistent with the spirit of the above proposal, has sent a letter to the Central Bank for its consideration. It is now learned that the Central Bank has sent a letter to its branches, instructing them to pay attention to this when approving interest rates in various regions.</p>
<p>Sugar Prices Gradually Increase.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market trend remained firm, with prices increasing. For example, white sugar rose by another 10% to 5%, red sugar rose by 10% to 8%, green sugar rose by 6% to 4%, and white sugar futures rose by over 100,000 to 670,000 yuan. The post-market prices for various numbers are recorded below: 24 coarse white spot large package 1.9 million, 45 car white bagged 1.91 million, 20 medium sand white 1.85 million, Taiwan red 2.05 million, Taiwan green 1.6 million, 47 period 24 coarse white 1.85 million, 2 period added another 390,000, 2 period 45 car white added 325,000, 1 period 45 added another 510,000, Xinghua white bagged 1.84 million, basket 1.78 million, red 1.64 million, Hainan red 1.71 million, high 1.85 million, Shantou green 1.7 million, Shunde green old 1.65 million, Diao green 1.6 million.</p>
<p>Sugar Shipped to Tianjin.</p>
<p>[Our Report] The China Merchants Bureau's Cai vessel sailed to Tianjin yesterday afternoon, carrying over 5,000 packages of sugar, over 500 boxes of cigarettes, and over 400 pieces of yarn and cloth.</p>
<p>Tea Prices Strong.</p>
<p>Since the widespread surge in prices of all goods, the foreign tea market, although in mediocre trading activity, has seen a uniform upward trend in quotations due to the bullish sentiment of holders. As for various domestic sales teas, both local streets and merchant buyers are still receptive, with a tendency to buy whatever is available. However, sellers are also holding firm, so the situation shows an imbalance between supply and demand, and transactions are difficult. Prices, on the other hand, are shining brightly, with solid footing.</p>
<p>Chinese Stocks Recover Briefly; Small Stocks Sequentially Hit Limit Down.</p>
<p>Chinese stocks surged again midway yesterday, but large investors took advantage of the high prices to sell off-market, and Yong Silk fell sharply from new highs of 812 yuan and 820 yuan. Small stocks turned from limit up to limit down, and the environment was unfavorable.</p>
<p>The morning opened with weakness across the board except for Xinyi and Sino-French, which were uniquely strong. Interest prices opened low at 2.1 and 2.55 yuan, and Yong Silk rose to 770 yuan and 778 yuan. Soon, rumors spread that the US dollar exchange rate was high, causing another commotion that pulled it out of the 800 yuan mark, reaching high prices of 812 yuan and 822 yuan. Speculators closed positions, falling to 775 yuan and 778 yuan at closing. As a result, compared to the previous close, Xinyi and Huafeng underwear rose to the limit and rebounded, with Xinyi rising by 10%, underwear rising by 5%, Huafeng uniquely flat, Xinhua fell by 50%, and Li'an fell by 10%. Zhabei, Huaxin, Commerce, Xinguangjing, Qin, Sino-French fell by 50%, Yong Silk rose by 50%, and the rest rose and fell slightly. In the forward market, Huafeng rose by 50%, Jingfu fell by 10%, and the rest rose and fell slightly.</p>
<p>The after-market opened and showed no support, falling to 768 yuan and 780 yuan, and once rose to 800 yuan and 810 yuan. After that, the wind turned, and external stimuli assisted, lacking opponents, and the decline was惨厉. Small stocks Xinhua, Sino-French, Jingfu, Qinyu, China Silk, Huaxin, Xinguang, Huafeng, Li'an, Yonggong, and Shunxu hit limit down, and the off-market was even more chaotic, falling to 749 yuan and 755 yuan. The closing price was 752 yuan and 757 yuan. As a result, compared to the last transaction, Yong Silk, Commerce, Li'an, Sino-French, and Xinhua hit limit down, Huaxin rebounded after hitting limit down, Guxiao was a small amount, China Textile and Datong fell by 10%, and the rest rebounded slightly. In the forward market, Jingfu hit limit down, Xinguang and Qinyu each fell by over 10%, and Yong Silk fell slightly. Off-market old stocks were tight and very strong, and Dasheng, China, and China actually rose by over 10%.</p>
<p>Wool Market Sales Weaken.</p>
<p>Wool sales have continued to weaken recently. Both local Qipan Street entrances and exits are clear. Business in men's and women's clothing stores in various districts is also tending to be light. Merchant buyers are lonely in adding purchases, because winter sales have already been ordered, and spring sales are still pending, so business is entering a difficult path. Yesterday, ordinary dyed flannel was mostly shouted at 950,000 to 1.1 million yuan per yard, blended woven flannel was sold at 1.25 million to 1.65 million yuan, Ji Ji was sold at 800,000 to 1.1 million yuan, Haibailong was sold at 1.6 million yuan, and riding breeches were 1.45 million yuan.</p>
<p>Industrial Raw Materials Are Hoarded.</p>
<p>Due to the lack of continued arrivals in the industrial raw material market, and with most of the third-quarter quota goods being imported, demand from all sides is very high, leading to a shortage of spot goods in the market. Industrial manufacturers are eagerly seeking, and those with goods are holding onto them and raising prices, unwilling to sell. The market trend is thriving. Hot-selling goods such as caustic soda and oils and fats are rising even more sharply. The highest price for Yuelai caustic soda was 60 million yuan per barrel, finally settling at 58.5 million yuan. American caustic soda also rose to 56 million yuan. Triangle brand glycerin 50-pound cans were 6.4 million yuan, and other goods also rose, up by 10% to 30-40% compared to the previous.</p>

<p>Literary and Historical Studies: The "Kingly and Hegemonic Ways Combined" of Emperor Wu of the Han Dynasty, by Deng Guangming</p>
<p>There is a story in the "Book of Han, Biography of Emperor Yuan" that says Emperor Yuan was gentle and fond of Confucianism. Seeing that his father, Emperor Xuan, favored officials who used law and legalism and liked to restrain his subordinates with criminal law, and that ministers such as Yang Yun and Gai Kuanrao suffered the misfortune of being killed merely because their words touched upon criticism, Emperor Yuan, during an informal banquet, calmly advised Emperor Xuan, saying:</p>
<p>"Your Majesty uses punishment too harshly; you should employ Confucian scholars."</p>
<p>Unexpectedly, this statement greatly angered Emperor Xuan. Emperor Xuan sternly told his son:</p>
<p>"The Han Dynasty has its own system: it is fundamentally a mixture of the ways of kings and hegemons. How can we rely purely on moral education and use the government of the Zhou Dynasty?..."</p>
<p>Emperor Xuan himself, according to the "Book of Han," on the one hand, "believed in rewarding and punishing without fail, comprehensively examining names and realities," causing "officials of politics, literature, law, and reason to perfect their abilities." On the other hand, he also "lectured on the Six Arts, exceptionally selected outstanding talents, and Xiao Wangzhi, Liangqiu He, Xiahou Sheng, Wei Xuancheng, Yan Pengzu, and Yin Gengshi advanced through Confucian scholarship; Liu Xiang and Wang Bao were distinguished by their writings; generals and ministers such as Zhang Anshi and Zhao Chongguo... administrators of the people such as Huang Ba, Wang Cheng, Xi Sui... Zhang Chang and others all had meritorious achievements and were described by the world." This was truly the most standard approach of "combining the ways of kings and hegemons." As for before Emperor Xuan, among the six reigns of Gao, Hui, Wen, Jing, Wu, and Zhao, the one whose approach was most in line with what Emperor Xuan said about "mixing the ways of kings and hegemons" should be the reign of Emperor Xuan's grandfather, Emperor Wu.</p>
<p>I.</p>
<p>Before ascending the throne, Emperor Wu studied under the Confucian scholar Wang Zang. Naturally, he couldn't help but yearn for the idealized realms of the Five Emperors and the prosperous Three Dynasties envisioned by Confucianism. What he longed for was a world where "manners were refined and commands were carried out, punishments were light and crimes were corrected, the people were harmonious and joyful, political affairs were clearly proclaimed, fresh dew fell, all grains prospered, virtue nourished the four seas, blessings reached the grasses and trees, the three lights were complete, the cold and heat were balanced, he received the blessings of Heaven and the spirits, and his virtue overflowed, extending to the outside world and reaching all living beings." He did not know that this was an ideal state that had never been reached, but only thought that the reason why the Han Dynasty, after seventy years of prosperity, had not yet reached this supreme and beautiful state was because human affairs were still not perfect and the art of governance had not yet fully achieved its potential.</p>
<p>In the early years of the Han Dynasty, after the long period of turmoil at the end of the Qin Dynasty, the court and the people all wanted to rest and do nothing. The Huang-Lao school of thought, advocating inaction and tranquility, became the prevailing scholarship at the time. Emperor Wen favored discussions on criminal law, Emperor Jing did not trust Confucian scholars, and Empress Dou of Emperor Wen especially favored the Huang-Lao school. Therefore, during these reigns, Confucianism was constantly rejected, and the various scholars held official positions but were not consulted and did not advance. The Han Dynasty, ruled for seventy years by these emperors, generals, and ministers who believed in Huang-Lao Taoism, was still in a state of "yin and yang in disarray, atmosphere filled with obstruction, living beings unable to fulfill their potential, the common people not helped, integrity and shame thrown into confusion, the worthy and unworthy mixed together." This was truly immeasurable compared to the ancient, prosperous age that Emperor Wu longed for day and night. Therefore, after Emperor Wu ascended the throne, on the one hand, he was filled with nostalgia for the past; on the other hand, he felt endless disgust and contempt for the current state of politics and society. The Confucian scholars who had always been unsuccessful in politics seized this opportunity to attribute all the bad phenomena in politics and society to "different techniques and strange doctrines," advocating that the status quo be changed, that is, that the systems be changed and the teachings be renewed, which meant that Confucianism must be promoted and all the previous governing techniques must be eliminated. When Emperor Wu first ascended the throne, his grandmother, Empress Dowager Dou, still wielded great power and severely suppressed this movement to restore ancient ways. After Dou's death in the sixth year of Jianyuan (135 BC), Emperor Wu could do as he pleased, and the proposals of these Confucian scholars were gradually implemented.</p>
<p>However, Emperor Wu of the Han was an extremely romantic person, fitting Sima Qian's comment, "He was full of desires inwardly but outwardly practiced benevolence and righteousness." He had a deep affection for the glorious era of the distant past and the vision of great unification eulogized by Confucianism, and he was willing to expand territories, pay homage to the Rong and Di peoples, govern China, and pacify the four barbarians. However, he could not strictly follow the path to governing the country and pacifying the world prescribed by Confucianism. He could not just correct his righteousness without seeking his own interests, just clarify his doctrine without considering his achievements. Achievement and interest were precisely the ultimate goals of Emperor Wu. This was a fundamental difference between Emperor Wu and the Confucian scholars. Because of this fundamental difference, what was manifested in Emperor Wu's employment of people and implementation of policies was necessarily very different from what Confucianism advocated: he could not trust pure Confucian scholars, and he could not fully adopt Confucian techniques. Confucian scholars, Confucian learning, and Confucian techniques were only used by him as objects to decorate the scene and embellish peace. This can be seen particularly clearly in the following matters:</p>
<p>I. Dong Zhongshu's three responses in the examination were highly appreciated by Emperor Wu, but the only ones that were truly implemented were "correcting the calendar and changing the colors of clothing" and "those who are not in the subjects of the Six Arts and the techniques of Confucius, all their paths should be cut off." However, Dong Zhongshu could only serve as a chancellor in a vassal state and was never truly trusted by Emperor Wu.</p>
<p>II. Gongsun Hong, as a Confucian scholar, responded to the selection of virtuous and good scholars and was also known and appreciated by Emperor Wu for his responses, rising from "being recommended and starting as a commoner to becoming prime minister and being enfeoffed as a marquis within a few years." This seems to indicate Emperor Wu's belief in Confucian scholars. However, Gongsun Hong's character was to distort learning to flatter the world and seek advancement. He would rather betray the agreements of his colleagues to cater to Emperor Wu's intentions, but he would never openly argue against Emperor Wu's opinions. To excuse Emperor Wu's extravagant and indulgent behavior, he even shamelessly uttered the slogan "The ruler worries about not being expansive, and the ministers worry about not being frugal." It was because he could abandon the position of a Confucian scholar at any time that he gained Emperor Wu's trust and was able to serve as prime minister and censor for as long as six years.</p>
<p>III. Some of the essayists at the time, such as Sima Xiangru, Zhu Maichen, Mei Gao, and Dongfang Shuo, were most fond of extravagant and flamboyant writing, exaggerating wealth and grandeur, and boasting of prosperous scenes. This was very much in line with Emperor Wu's fondness for greatness and his extravagant and unrestrained nature. Therefore, they were successively favored by Emperor Wu, and he almost felt that he had met everyone too late. These people mostly entered and exited the palace and became close officials, becoming the most trusted literary attendants. Although literary attendants did not occupy an important position in the organization of the government at the time, because they were "always at his side" and often discussed matters with the powerful ministers, and they were able to use their artful words to influence the ministers, they were actually people who truly had a practical effect on influencing state affairs.</p>
<p>Under the auxiliary influence of these Confucian officials and literati, Emperor Wu dismissed the hundred schools of thought, extolled the Six Classics, and recruited talented individuals from across the country. He also "established the Imperial Academy, repaired suburban sacrifices, corrected the calendar, determined the numbers, harmonized music, composed ritual music, established the feng and shan sacrifices, worshiped the hundred gods, and continued the descendants of the Zhou Dynasty," so that even his orders and writings were all "brilliantly commendable." All of this was the entirety of Emperor Wu's actions in the area of the kingly way. In it, we can hardly find which items were closely related to the national economy and the people's livelihood.</p>
<p>II.</p>
<p>That Mr. Gongsun Hong, who started as a Confucian scholar and within a few years rose to become prime minister and be enfeoffed as a marquis, was not only good at distorting learning and flattering the world to seek advancement. According to his biography in the "Book of Han," he was originally a person who "was familiar with the affairs of officials of law and legalism and embellished them with Confucian techniques." This means that Gongsun Hong was outwardly a Confucian scholar, but at heart he was most proficient in criminal law and legalism. The approach of this Mr. Gongsun, whom Emperor Wu trusted most, actually best represented Emperor Wu himself and the entire approach of Emperor Wu's reign. In all places where decoration was needed and empty rhetoric was required, Emperor Wu adopted the doctrines of Confucianism, but in all practical political and criminal measures closely related to the national economy and the people's livelihood, he entirely adopted the techniques of governance of the legalist school. The Confucian set of claims to "reduce penalties and lighten taxes" was no longer under consideration by Emperor Wu.</p>
<p>Because the early Han Dynasty adopted Huang-Lao's policy of inaction to rest with the people, by the time Emperor Wu ascended the throne, this policy had achieved great results: the people were self-sufficient, and society had reached considerable prosperity. The government also had abundant wealth and goods in its treasury, and the grain in its granaries was piled up. At the same time, however, this doctrine of inaction also cultivated several scourges. The most important of these were: I. Avoiding the use of force against the powerful enemy, the Xiongnu in the north, and instead implementing a policy of marriage alliance, while the Xiongnu continued to insult the Han Dynasty. II. Emperors Wen and Jing tried their best to reduce the taxes and levies on the peasants, sometimes even exempting them for more than a decade. This was originally a policy that benefited the people, but it unexpectedly only benefited the wealthy farmers who owned land. Poor people tilled the land and still had to pay most of their harvests to the landlords every year. As a result, the rich became richer and were able to buy large amounts of land, engaging in unrestrained annexation, and the poor and weak people were further plunged into misery. III. The practice of wandering chivalry, which had been prevalent in society since the Warring States period, also grew in an unhindered state in the early Han Dynasty. These wandering knights were all outlaws who violated prohibitions with violence. They colluded with the relatives of the Han court and the ministers and the vassal kings of the various kingdoms. The ministers and vassal kings were all happy to raise large numbers of wandering knights to fill their own strength, or even to compete with the central government. The wandering knights each formed gangs and each had their own supported leaders. The supported leaders, "raced in the alleys and lanes, became famous throughout the world, wielded power in the states, and could bend dukes and marquises with their strength." Although they had no official positions or titles, they were able to "steal the power of life and death with the smallness of a commoner." This was usually a factor of unrest and unease in an agricultural society, becoming a major concern in the countryside. Emperor Wu of the Han also regarded them as a force of evil that split the power of the emperor and hated them bitterly.</p>
<p>The second of the above three matters had already been regarded as a major crisis in society by the Confucian scholars before Emperor Wu. What he worried about was that the poor and weak farmers, in order to escape hunger and cold, would sell their wives, children, and fields and homes, and after embarking on a path of exile, there was the possibility of revolutionary events occurring. Therefore, after Emperor Wu ascended the throne, Dong Zhongshu also proposed the object of "limiting the people's private ownership of land to supplement those who are insufficient." However, Emperor Wu of the Han did not deeply recognize the importance of this issue. He did not regard it as an ailment that should be treated. He was simply fascinated by the wealth of the national treasury and the superficial prosperity of society, and was led onto the path of "inwardly indulging in the pleasures of the senses and outwardly pursuing the achievements of subduing the four barbarians." He wanted to use this rich wealth and manpower to launch military campaigns abroad, complete the great task of conquering the four barbarians, and eliminate all separatist efforts at home, so that he alone could enjoy supreme glory.</p>
<p>Emperor Wu wanted to launch military campaigns, but the general public was absolutely unwilling to leave their homes and abandon their livelihoods to serve on the battlefield. At this time, Emperor Wu had no choice but to use severe punishments to drive the people to pursue meritorious achievements. And when the use of troops lasted for a long time, the granaries and treasuries</p>

<h3 id="e10">Review of Measures to Suppress Hoarding <a href="#e10" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c10" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">10</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's editorial discussed the problem of rising prices, arguing that emphasis should be placed on increasing production, fair distribution, stabilizing currency value, and balancing the budget – these proactive measures that address the root cause. We must earnestly and diligently 　, and not merely focus on the passive suppression measures of registration and inspection. This is not to say that "suppression" is definitely unusable, but at most, it can only be effective for a short time and does not contribute to the overall plan. Moreover, even when suppressing, it must be done reasonably and legally, and the cooperation of legitimate industrial and commercial organizations must be obtained. At the very beginning of this endeavor, it is absolutely impermissible to exceed the bounds of the law and act rashly. Only by cooperating with the people can officials achieve success. Advanced countries 　 管制, with organizational strength and social systems far 　 于 ours, still require caution and meticulousness when handling matters, let alone our country?</p>
<p>Currently, government officials believe that as long as the existing "Emergency Period Measures for Suppressing National Accumulation and Hoarding of Important Daily Necessities" are implemented, the rising price trend can be curbed. In reality, 　未免 this is an oversimplified view. This is because the current measures for suppressing hoarding have many shortcomings, as this newspaper has repeatedly pointed out in previous articles. The main points are: 　The "large-scale purchase and storage" that constitutes the crime is too vague, making it difficult to adjudicate. 　The procedures for declaration, registration, reporting, and verification are too cumbersome, and various associations and responsible authorities will inevitably be unable to cope due to limited manpower. 　The "raising prices beyond legal profits" that constitutes hoarding is difficult to determine because current prices and various expenses fluctuate too dramatically, government offices lack information, and the "legal profits" of various items cannot be adjusted in a timely manner. There are also many other difficulties 　礙難 to implement. However, during the recent Executive Yuan meeting discussing this case, it was surprisingly decided that "the regulations are already complete, there is no need to draft new laws, and the procedures and formalities of legislation can be saved" and instead "drafting detailed implementation rules and then submitting them to the Executive Yuan for review" would be done. One cannot help but feel deeply disappointed. Perhaps the intention of all the officials is truly to save the legislative process, but saying that the regulations are already complete is probably not entirely true.</p>
<p>These measures were originally promulgated during the Anti-Japanese War and were also not subjected to legislative procedures. They were only reaffirmed and urged for implementation last year on February 17 when the Economic Emergency Measures Program was promulgated, due to too many obstacles and little effect. However, laws are laws, and facts are facts. According to what we know, despite the government's repeated orders and urging compliance, it seems that no businesses in this city have registered and reported according to the law, let alone correcting, reporting, and investigating. Moreover, according to Article 5 of these measures, the responsible authorities must first announce the types and names of goods to be suppressed. Given the large number of factories and shops in this city and the small number of personnel in the responsible authorities, how will they cope if all businesses come to register after the announcement? The reasons for this, in addition to the three major shortcomings mentioned above, are many other obstacles and questions. We will list them separately below for review.</p>
<p>The problem of agency buying fees, without a real buyer or seller, 　亦 is one of the grounds for constituting the 　積 crime according to Article 3. We do not understand how this transaction can be established if there is no buyer or seller. Almost every industry in Shanghai has 　客, that is, there is no industry 　無 without agency buying fees. These 　客, despite being criticized as being third parties, exploiting classes, and fictitious firms, there are no explicit regulations prohibiting them in the laws passed by the Legislative Yuan. On the contrary, Article 3 of the current Commercial Registration Law explicitly lists brokerage, commission, and agency businesses, and there is no prohibition against brokers from engaging in their own transactions. Therefore, this clause is clearly untenable.</p>
<p>The issue of market sales 　Not selling in the market, coupled with "raising prices beyond legal profits," constitutes hoarding. Article 11 of the same measures also includes the restriction of "not refusing to sell," the intention of which is to promote transactions in order to suppress hoarding. However, except for retail businesses, the goods of most owners are stored in warehouses and are not publicly displayed. Even if all businesses register and report, how can general buyers know for sure that such goods are stored? Moreover, how can they determine that it constitutes "not selling in the market" or "refusing to sell"? If one were to say that since it has been registered, one can simply consult it, it is questionable whether Chinese-style government offices would allow any buyer to readily consult and examine records at any time, and what provisions could be relied upon to allow consultation? As for goods under unified purchase and sale, it is even more impossible to sell them at market prices, so how can these measures be applied?</p>
<p>The issue of selling within a limited time 　Articles 8, 10, 11, and 12 of the measures all explicitly mention selling within a limited time. Leaving aside the question of what the specific time limit is, the sale of goods ultimately depends on 　胃口 (demand). In many places, there are even restrictions based on affiliation, season, and type. In the current state of restricting payments and domestic remittances, the financial resources of buyers are especially problematic. If a deadline for sale is set, but there are no buyers or the demand is too narrow to absorb the supply, how can a sale be enforced at that time? We also know that according to the provisions of Articles 10 and 12, the responsible authorities can order the goods to be transported to a designated location for sale, sell them on behalf of the owner, have the trade association sell them on behalf of the owner, or have the materials management or price-controlled supply and marketing agencies purchase them. However, when the market is sluggish, it is not easy to sell all 　貨 goods unless there is a truly large-scale 　, selling at a loss. Moreover, the measures repeatedly mention the so-called legal profit, and it does not seem that they must necessarily sell at a loss; when ordering merchants 　 令 to sell within a limited time, it seems that the responsible authorities do not have the power to force merchants to sell at a loss, harming the legitimate interests of the owners. Therefore, what happens when the goods cannot be sold within the time limit remains a problem.</p>
<p>Some may say that materials management and price-controlled supply and marketing agencies are presumably not private in nature and should have no difficulty 　款 purchasing. However, even the resources of non-private agencies have their limits. The fact that goods imported without a license require the use of certificates of deposit for payment and must be paid in installments is sufficient proof. The fact that many export goods cannot be sold, and the industries have repeatedly requested purchases, but have ultimately been refused due to lack of budget is another proof. Even if the government issues huge amounts of banknotes 　款 and undertakes to collect fees, it is clearly another problem whether this huge amount of banknotes is consistent with the original intention of suppressing hoarding and stabilizing prices.</p>
<p>The issue of reporting, declaring, registering, and verifying. Articles 8 and 9 stipulate that before the implementation of these measures, all merchants, whether in the industry or not, should report their inventory for sale, and the trade associations should review and report; Article 13 further stipulates that after the implementation of these measures, merchants in the industry should register with the trade association each time they purchase goods and report when they sell them, and the trade association should submit monthly reports to the responsible authorities for verification. The procedures are so cumbersome that we will not discuss whether there are enough personnel in the merchants, trade associations, and government offices to handle this matter. However, after each batch of goods and each transaction goes through the above-mentioned procedures of declaring, reporting, registering, and submitting, the final result is nothing more than a cursory examination and verification. The process is top-heavy and bottom-light, and seems to be quite thought-provoking. Because the final step is only verification, it seems that the above-mentioned cumbersome procedures are not necessary, and it is impossible to suppress hoarding. If 　要 the goal is to suppress illegal hoarding, then this verification work is obviously still insufficient. May we ask, how can the traces of hoarding be detected simply by checking the reported goods and the reported numbers of inputs and outputs from both within and outside the industry? How can the loopholes of omission, false reporting, underreporting, and overreporting be traced and corrected? Moreover, if a government office lacking administrative efficiency is forced to handle such trivial and cumbersome matters, the result may be that the government offices merely produce more paper reports!</p>
<p>From the above points of view, although the Executive Yuan believes that "the regulations are already complete, there is no need to draft new laws," the fact is that 　張 the gap is too large, and there is a definite need to reconsider and revise them. Because the drafting of detailed implementation rules, 　名思義, is merely to supplement the implementation procedures appropriately, but the shortcomings and difficulties in the measures themselves are already a foregone conclusion and may not be corrected. Therefore, the result of implementation may still be ineffective. Is this the original intention of the government to suppress prices?</p>
