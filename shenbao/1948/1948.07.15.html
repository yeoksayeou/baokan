<h3>停發新鈔乎？增發大鈔乎？</h3>
<p>號金融界權威方面消息：政府已命令中央銀行停止發行鈔票，以壓平物價漲風，這是空谷足音，一般人所渴望其爲千眞萬確的。但同時所謂大鈔發行的傳說，依然在市面上流行着，儘管有關當局一再否認，而一般揣測，以爲衡諸往例，莫非又是官　文章。甚至有人以爲照情勢看來，恐怕箭在弦上，大鈔似有不得不發之勢。那麽，這個日漲夜大的通貨問題，確乎値得大家注意的了。</p>
<p>目前現鈔已鬧得要貼水，而一面國行正在大量差進，一面又由央行拋出大量物資，藉以收縮銀根。此等作風，在當局自有其冠冕堂皇的理由，以爲如此庶幾可以抑平物價。可是，在市塲上的眼光看來，仍不外爲造成一種形勢，迫使商界自動要求，作爲發行大鈔的良好根據。過去的經騐吿訴我們，這種推測，也似乎並非毫無依據。</p>
<p>形勢旣已轉折到如此地步，大鈔的應否發行，及其對於物價影響如何，在現在，似已不必多所討論；横豎大家贊成，當局固然會俯順衆情，即予發行，即使有一部份人顧慮太多，仍認爲將剌激物價，亦未必能終於壓住，使這一類大鈔長此不發。</p>
<p>的確，現在鈔票不夠用，而檢點與携帶又太費事，縱使犬鈔不發行，物價的漲風亦未必能長久撳得下去。因為物價的上漲，是由於鈔票流通額的太多，流通區的縮小，與局轉率的太快，而並非單純地由於票面的大小。所以剌激物價這一層顧慮，未必就會把這一件事斷然予以取消的。</p>
<p>話雖如此說，物價的上漲，到底與通貨的多寡具有密切的關係。翁院長在立法院中，即曾公開地作如是說，前任宋張兩院長和財長等亦嘗明白承認此事，並不諱言。所以發行大鈔，增加通貨，固將剌激物價，迫使上漲，而停發大鈔，仍繼續增發小（？）票，亦何嘗能穩定幣値，穩定物價？除非中央價有大決心，即日起與國人以共見，絕不添發一張新鈔，不論票面的大小，物價的狂瀾是很難挽回的。</p>
<p>因此之故，本問題的焦點，倒不在於傳說中之大鈔應否發行，和何時發行，而在於日漲夜大之通貨膨脹，到底政府有沒有決心和辦法加以斷然制止。換言之，今天的問題是停止發鈔與否，而不是新發大鈔與否。</p>
<p>中央政府如還是因循敷衍，得過且過，對通貨不下決心，則以物價上漲，底　增高的結果，現在所擬發的所謂大鈔，幾個月後，恐怕又將成為小鈔，爾時的鈔票發行額，又將見為不够用。而鐵點與携帶，亦仍將認爲太費事，到那時，另一號更大的大鈔，又勢必應時而生；物價與大鈔，如此互爲因果，循環出現，我們眞不敢想像。我們實在不知道：國家的幣制，金融，和物價政策，是否應當循此軌道，繼續放任演變下去？</p>
<p>我們很明白，財政收支的不平衡，是迫使當局不得不濫發鈔票以資應急。財政當局也未嘗不知道濫發鈔票的大　，但只是在應急二個字的掩護下做此偸懶的印鈔工作！不知應急只是應急，總不能視爲經常；開源節流，其道甚多，斷不能靠發鈔爲唯一途徑，亦斷不能僅恃印鈔爲財政部長的惟一拿手好戲！我們對於彌補赤字的方案，也嘗屢經　陳，各方面對此的建議尤多；我們斷不相信，國家的財政，竟已到了非靠發鈔不能支持的地步。</p>
<p>古人云：「危而不持，顚而不扶，則將焉用彼相矣一！現在的發行政策，確實太顚太危了，不能不迅予扶持。負責任的，再不宜袖手坐視，毫無行動，單拿戡亂這一句口號來作爲濫發鈔票的護身符，更不宜空談平價，諉過囤積，把這一項膨脹通貨的重大責任，輕輕地完全推到工商界的身上去。至於傳說中的大鈔，如果就此打住，以後不再有更大的大鈔陸續發現，我們以爲，這並非大不了的事。假如通貨膨脹的政策，依舊沿襲下去，不想制止，那麽，不必待諸所謂大鈔，卽就目前所發行的中鈔小鈔而論，已够使國計民生焦頭爛額的了！</p>
<h3>關於中大三學生被捕事　首都衛戍總部發表逮捕審訊經過　「營救會」係職業學生策劃</h3>
<p>〔中央社南京十四日電〕首都衛戍總司令部發言人，頃就今日報載華彬淸等三人被捕，中大學生組織國立中央大學營救被捕同學委會，並決定六項營救辦法一事，發表談話稱：本部日前接獲首都警察廳之報吿；三汶河三道埂子有一居民名周少淸，行動極爲詭密，同時每日時有行踪可疑之人來往其家。該管石鎭橋派出所黄焯生，陳永康二巡官對此事頗爲注意。至五日晚九時，又見有四人進入周少淸家，陳黄二巡官乃派警逮捕該四人，即四散奔逃，至深夜二時，始前後就逮。惟周少淸在逃，尙未捕獲。同時在周少淸家中搜査，發現有開會記錄等重要文件，帶所後該四人中有名陶榮貴供認曾與學生有聯絡，並約定於本月六日上午七時於上新河北河口會面，送該生往安徽巢縣。陳黄二巡官當即根據口供，率警於北河口等待，至七時果見有與陶榮貴聯絡之學生與另外二學生齊到北河口，陳黄二巡官當即上前詰詢，並在該生等身邊搜出若干反動書籍及傳單，賬目等物，經帶所詢後，始知該三生係中大共匪職業學生一名朱成學（中大法律系），一名李飛（中大化工系），一名華彬淸（中大政治系），當即解局審訊。該學生等自覺無可掩其罪跡，亦自認不諱。並各於口供中坦白承認，自悔其行動之非法。復暗中利用社會關係分向各方予以營救。警察廳以本案案情重大，已將人犯罪證轉解特種刑事法庭，依法法辦，一俟判決即可全案公佈。中大學生所組織之營救委會，想係共匪職業學生所策劃，一若孫總司令上次談話所料「此案發生後共匪必製造謠言，淆亂視聽，並進而鼓動風潮，以增加執法機關之困難」。本部亟望學生憑理智守紀綱，勿焉共匪利用。</p>

<h3>西文盟國抗議封鎖柏林　莫斯科提出覆牒　英美空運力量大事增強</h3>
<p>〔合眾社倫教十四日電〕蘇聯駐英大使薩魯平，十四日將望眼欲穿之蘇聯對英美法抗議之覆文遞交英外部。蘇聯覆牒之性質，急切間尙不能獲悉。覆文提出之際，粕林西方外交家正預料將有不利之答覆。薩魯平將覆文遞交國務大臣麥克尼爾，距三國要求蘇聯解除「不可忍」之柏林封鎖幾爲一星期。此間最權成人士預料，蘇聯將建議重開四强對德國一切問題之談判及放棄西德計劃，以對抗西方之抗議。然西方則在柏林封鎖解除前，不擬討價還價。東西在德國之關係已近窮途末路，致西方外交家一致公認唯一方法爲高級人士之再度嘗試，然彼等對於官方計劃則絕口不提。二月前彼等譏笑四强會議之再開，現則一變而爲懷疑，且並不否認四外長會議再開之可能性。</p>

<p>〔路透社羅馬十四日電〕五十四歲之義共領袖陶格里亞蒂，今晨出衆院時遇刺受傷，經以救護車送往醫院途中，陶氏已入昏迷狀態。陶氏甫出議院側門，即遭一年約三十歲之靑年通發四槍，彈入陶氏胸部，兇手當塲被捕。陶氏被送入醫院後，立即施用手術。醫師最近發表之公報有云，「傷者已施輸血手術，最嚴重之彈傷爲左胸腋下部份，肺部似無恙。爲避免震動起見，尙有兩處傷痕尙未施檢査，刻已爲傷者注射急救劑傷勢一般而論，頗屬堪虞」。</p>

<h3>中國第一輛高速度列車在常州誕生</h3>
<p>— 本報記者　李天行</p>
<p>〔本報武進十一日訊〕報界已宣傳過，戚機廠新造「絕熱列車」已完成，記者爲此特約了同志，專程訪問了一次。</p>
<p>戚機廠沿車</p>
<p>機廠在戚墅堰鎭西里許，廠以地名，居京滬綫中心，前身爲吳淞機廠，民國廿六年始遷來，一是因爲地點適中，同時附邇戚墅堰電廠，取電容易，戰前原有員工一千五百餘，淪陷期間劃歸僞華中鐵道局管理，勝利後物歸原主，幾年規復，現有員工三千餘人，佔地面積五十萬七千五百餘平方公尺。塲房建築總面積爲三萬二千四百餘平方尺。全部員工宿舍等房屋新舊建築約八百間，屋舍毘連，自成一熱鬧的工廠區域。工人連眷屬數約近萬。</p>
<p>廠內各機構</p>
<p>內部組織機構，大要以「繪圖」「化驗」「訓練」「檢査」四單位，統歸「技術股」，「督導」「檢査」兩系並對廠長直接負責。工作股分設〔機車」，「車輛」，「通用」三組，設備分配成立「組工」，「客車」，「貨車」，「鍋爐」，「修配」，「電機」，「工具」，「汽車」「副營」，「鋸木」，「材料化騐」等十餘個工塲。此外，還有藝徒訓練班和扶輪小學兩個敎育機構。福利事業除一鐵路醫院」外，如運動，物資配給等都有一種組織主管着。四圍是廠屋林立，鋼鐵横陳。一片輪轉聲，釘錘聲，創造的意境，鍜鍊的氣味，充滿着堅硬的畫面與强烈的音符。電，熱，力，加理想，加人工，有組織的演出。塲面是相當令人感奮，廠長高振洲是高高的個子，四十餘歲中年北方型有理想，有毅力，有氣魄的人物。</p>
<p>廠長一席話</p>
<p>高廠長在致歡迎參觀詞後，接着就說明他這次毅然建立這「中國第一列車」的經過；他說：「我們爲要求中國列車質的改善，以及顧到旅客在行的方面應該有設備，憑我們的理想，來實現這列車。現在初步是成功了。可是爲了要在七月十五日準時出廠，一切在趕造，有許多地方還不够理想。他又說：「截至現在，這次新車，是中國第一列車！」接着，一個靑年工程師王廣譽對新列車作進一層的解釋。</p>
<p>工程師解釋</p>
<p>王工程師是遼寗人，他以很熟情而又親切的態度對一這新生列車作進一步的解釋：據稱。現在外界對新造列車，命名很多。豪華列車，絕熱列車，流綫型列車，實際是一件事，也就是高速度列車。機廠白接收時頭二三四等車輛總數不過二百輛，不够應用，機廠三年來工程，第一階段，在求數量增加，現已有六百輛，足够應用，現在計劃再進步在求質的改進。這所謂流綫型列車，實爲第一步頭等車理想的改進。繼續再作，二三等車輛的改進。</p>
<p>列車五特點</p>
<p>這次「中國第一列車」的試造，第一可貴點，是百分之九十五是就地取材，自己製造，絕少依賴外國。特點：（一）車身全部用電焊，不用毛釘，統體光潔，可愛。（二）絕熱，車內與外界空氣隔絕，另用電氣裝備，使車內保持一個適宜的溫度。在熟天經常保持較空間低十四五度的溫和，叫人舒適。反之，在冬天也有保溫調節。（三）座位統間一個前進面。坐椅有三個角度。坐着，躺着，小臥着，都可隨心所欲。必要時，還可掉轉身來，和你背後的朋友對話密談。旋轉伸屈，十分自在。保證乘客獲得相當的舒服。（四）承軸全用滾子裝着，可提高速度。（五）車門和踏梯相連接，門開起來就有梯子可以下來，關起門來梯子也就不見了，可以减少危險。</p>
<p>新車共十輛</p>
<p>新車一共製十輛每輛長二十公尺，比較現下一段車輛爲長些。外觀上，自車頭至最後，一律新型。十輛中六輛是客車，一一輛是裝發電機，裝有柴油小型强力發電機一座，發電量一百KW（瓩）行李房，郵件間，車長室，電話間，播音室，差不多是全車的神經體系。車長在此可以發號施令，命令全車。一輛是餐車，精緻台桌，大小約十餘張，一端裝置電灶，電爐，氷箱，冷飲熱吃的供應，均毫無問題，飯菜茶湯的傳遞，都帶上科學的衛生管理。用過面巾，都有消毒的設備。最後一輛是瞭望車，中間有客廳，沙發，談座，專供旅客閒眺郊外景物，小坐叙談，收聽廣播，都應有盡有。</p>
<h3>戚機廠工房失火　老嫗少女葬身火窟</h3>
<p>〔本報武進十二日訊〕戚　堰機廠工人宿舍一　十二日上午不愼於火，屋中以置有大量火柴火　等物，着燃甚熾，二樓老嫗趨避不及躍樓墮地致死，又一少女因搶取物件不及走出，葬身火窟。消防隊灌救及時，始得免於延燒。</p>
<h3>吳興大鬧臭風潮</h3>
<p>〔本報吳興十二日訊〕本城近日大閙臭風潮，緣全城五萬餘人口之糞便咸認一塊肥肉，意圖包辦者頗不乏人，致引起軒然大波。縣府令交衛生院試辦，乃全體鎭民代表，認爲糞肥是鎭公所合法收入，當經召開全鎭保長會議，決堅持續辦，十二日萬院長前往接收未成。</p>
<h3>瀋市兩車夫患霍亂暴斃</h3>
<p>〔本報瀋陽十三日電〕　南市區三輪車夫程餘，於十二日午患霍亂暴卒街頭。又北陵區三輪車夫曹忠，五十歲，於同日下午四時，覺腹痛吐瀉，經時斃命。</p>
<h3>上海人在香港</h3>
<p>— 本報特約記者　子健</p>
<p>〔本報香港十一日航訊〕從上海來港的人，一天比一天多，他們便不知不覺的自成一個社會，同時也影響着原有的社會，好像輸進新血液似的。一個來自上海的朋友說：「廣東人來香港，是「撈世界」的，我們上海人來香港是「避世」的。前者是來找錢，後者是花錢，（至少有一部份人是如此）。前者的生活本錢以國幣作本位，後者的行囊裏却滿載美鈔或黄金」。</p>
<p>上海人「一擲萬金」這種闊綽手段，這一兩年來，已普遍的引起一般香港人的驚訝。香港的富豪大半是「勤儉起家」的，到了現在，民間還流行着富商某某安步當車的佳話，他們看見「逃難」來的上海人，動不動買了價値幾十萬的地皮，蓋了價値一兩千萬的工廠或幾十萬的洋房，還有簇新的自用汽車，花枝招展的姬妾，怎能不「刮目相看？」</p>
<p>港中若干洋人開辦的商店，過去祇有少數高等華人問津，現在却給「上海先生」和「上海小姐」所包圍，最名貴的英國銀器，就算倫敦白金漢宮的喬治六世也不易買得到手的，英人爲了爭取外匯，偶然把三兩件寄到香港來，不出半個鐘頭，便給我們的闊同鄉搶購一空，遲到的寗願先付定洋，預購下班船期寄到的貨色。一個熟識中國人心理的碧眼兒Manageress對記者說：「你們上海大寧眞多錢！」記者聞言，不禁揑了一把汗！</p>

<h3>銀根抽緊檢查嚴厲　各種物價均回跌　市面現鈔奇缺本票竟須貼水</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕昨日因銀根抽緊，本市物價全面下跌。華股多種跌停，米粉油糧亦因銀根甚緊，當局嚴格檢査倉庫，致人心虛軟，囤貨出籠，而市價大挫。米糧售價平均跌一一百萬，上白米市價已退入三千萬大關，棉紗布行情，亦因銀根奇緊及受一般物價下落之影響，爲之普跌一成。其他商品，如絲綢及捲烟日用品等，批發價格亦傾瀉，商界現對常局檢査會庫及拋售物資兩項政策，密切注視，尤以國行設立物資財務委員會，證明政府有運用美援及其他掌握之物資，以平抑物價之決心，故咸具戒心。未來之物價趨勢，悉視金融當局執行此項政策之努力程度以爲斷。</p>
<p>又昨日市面上因國行大量抽緊銀根，致市面籌碼奇缺，本票貼水自百分之五，提高至百分之入，行莊方面因感受業務上之困難，曾與國行接洽，希望能接濟現鈔。惟一般推測國行將利用月半發薪之機會，逼令工商業拋售物資，以穩定物價云。</p>
<h3>國行設物資財務委員會　控制物資調劑市場　昨日舉行成立會議　派李立俠為召集人</h3>

<h3>本屆世運籃球錦標產生方法　先經過分組循環再淘汰決定冠軍</h3>
<p>〔本報特稿〕籃球是本屆世運中最吃重的項目，自七月三十日—世運會正式　　後之次日—起，至八月十四日閉幕日止，除星期日休息外，每日上午，下午，以至晚間，都有比賽。</p>
<p>籃球在世界各地，雖然都極普遍，但是在世運會中，却還只有二屆的歷史（一九三六年第十一屆大會在柏林舉行時方才正式列入比賽項目）。第一屆共有廿三國參加，採複式淘汰制（Double　Knock—out　System）角逐，第一週被淘汰的隊伍，相互舉行落選賽，優勝者仍有與第一週勝隊爭雄機會。辨法固然尙稱公允，但漏巵也不少，例如菲列賓初賽第二週中雖曾戰勝墨西哥，不過複賽第一週便被黜於强敵美國，墨西哥却因對手軟弱而進入半決賣，結果墨西哥得第三名，菲列賓反屈居第五。又日本亦曾擊敗波籣，竟未能參與複賽，波藺反因秘魯之退出，而得第四名。負責一切比賽事宜之國際業餘籃球協會有鑒於此，經渦長時期的研討，決定自本屆起，改用循環淘汰制。</p>
<p>循環淘汰</p>
<p>所謂循環淘汰制，共分前後兩部。前部初賽，採分組循環制，如參加單位在廿四隊以下時，分四組比賽，以上屆前四名美，加，墨，波，依次爲一二三四組種子隊，其他隊伍，則以抽籤方法排入各組，各隊每勝一次得兩點，敗一次得一點，棄權零點。角逐一週後，各組得分最多的前二名，獲得參與後部比賽權利。</p>
<p>後部比賽採淘汰制，以各分組冠軍爲種子隊，各分組亞軍則分別抽籤塡入，但以不和本組第一名對壘爲原則。最後四隊複賽時，優勝之兩隊決冠亞軍，失敗者決三四兩席。循環賽中各組之三四名，另組成淘汰賽，決定第九至第十六名。其餘各隊另組淘汰賽，決定十七名以後各名次。</p>
<p>廿五隊以上改分為八組</p>
<p>假如參加隊伍在廿五隊以上時，前部循環賽便將改分八組，根據上屆世運籃球比賽結果及一九四七年南美與歐洲錦標賽的成績，以（一）美國，（二）加拿大，（三）墨西哥，（四）波蘭，（五）菲列賓，（六）烏拉圭，（七）一九四七年歐洲冠軍，（八）一九四七年南美洲冠軍，爲各組種子隊。其他各隊，仍然用抽籤方法排入。</p>
<p>後部淘汰賽，仍由各組的前二名參加，第一，二，三，組的冠軍爲前三名種子除，其他五組冠軍抽籤排定名次後，再依前述方法，仍在同一組內的前二名不再自相殘殺的原則下，以各組的第二名抽籤塡入，此役卽依照淘汰制比賽辦法，決定冠亞季殿軍。</p>
<p>循環淘汰制雖然仍有弊端，——假如甲國所在之一組，除種子隊外，另有强旅乙國，甲國極難有晋入後部比賽的希望。但是，同時有實力不及甲國之丙國，所在之另一組，除稱子隊外盡是庸師，丙國卽可能獲得複賽權。——但已較僅須在第一週中輪空卽能晋入複賽之複式淘汰制爲完善。事實上，要强求在如此短促的時間丙結束的比賽，有盡善盡美的制度，是絕對不可能的。（鑫）</p>

<h3>「公文旅行」</h3>
<p>— 平齋</p>
<p>前幾天在報上看到浙江省陳主席改革公文制度，力求行文簡單敏捷，倒很想知道他試行的成績怎樣。</p>
<p>我從前曾在某政府機關看見過一個公文，卷而上連蓋了十八個經辦人的圖章，打成油膩膩的通紅的一大片，而這件公文的內容却是一件極小極小的例行公事，心想這可謂「衙門政治一之大觀矣，不禁失笑。不想前幾天和一位舍親談起了這件事，却發現我畢竟還少見多怪！</p>
<p>我的那位舍親在一個全國性的經濟管制機關裏當秘書，一天到晚拳打脚踢的都是公文。據她說，她曾看見過一份公事上一迎蓋了五十八個圖章，而最後的決定是名副其實的「緩辦」二字。不過這還不算希奇。據說有一個職員，上呈文吿病假。這件呈文「旅行一了許多天，批下來的時候，那位要求吿假的小職員業已入土爲安，下葬竣事！</p>
<p>爲甚麼公文非如此辛苦的「旅行」不可呢？據說，機關大，部門多，如果不這樣蓋一蓋圖章，有許多事就谷部門都不接頭，說不定處理時就會出漏洞。言之彷彿成理，可惜我們的各機關主管長官却都會下小字條，要添人就添人，要撥款就撥款，儘管這件公文一路上應當躭擱的「站頭」甚多，每個站頭」上都有人手擎圖章待蓋，可是這一張小宇條却統統飛過，以空運的姿態直接到了奉命執行者的手裏。各部門倒也未必就因而不接頭，處理時倒也未必就因而出漏洞。</p>
<p>「公文旅行」在外國也相當可觀。我方才看見一本新出的外國雜誌，說美國有一極端機密的情報機構，動用的款項極多，而這個機關裏所分析整理的情報却全是六七個月以前的東西！那篇文章上還說美國國會裏的議員最近才略知眞相，頗爲愕然云云。這種「公文旅行」的速度倒也着實可以佩服：虧他們有這樣好耐心！</p>
<p>因之，想想我國機關主管長官之常下權高一切的「手諭」，和羅斯福總統之常常閃電式的派遺特使，雖然都招到過不少指摘，實在倒是可以原諒的。</p>
<p>我想，我國的官塲雖然一向考究「火候」，注重「功架」，但要說長官們存心希望把公事擱得叫人心癢難熬，却恐怕　免有點寃枉。我看「公文旅行」之所以這樣普一遍，道理是有的：你如果有過和政府機關銀錢往來的經騐，你就永世不會忘掉領一筆款于是如何的難—今天「公事沒有批。一明天「公事沒有到。」儘管物價一日數跳，而公文之「慢慢叫」如故。你要公文早點「旅行」完畢，款子早點領到嗎？有何難哉！咖啡館小坐片刻，「扣頭」談妥，公文也就立即到了。</p>
<p>「公文旅行」的「妙用」，恐怕倒是在這種地方。</p>
<h3>霉天養魚</h3>
<p>— 吳吉人</p>
<p>黃霉時節家家雨，這幾天的暴風雨，我們農塲裘種植的東西和飼養的金魚，都感受到嚴重的威脅，尤其幾百缸大小金魚，都有些危在旦夕，幸虧飼養的那位「老魚奴」—老劉，他有幾十年義魚的經驗，居然使它們轉危爲安，度此難關。</p>
<p>霍天裏義魚，實在是很難的，因爲這一時期的氣壓太低，角在缸中，受不了這窒息的氣氛，老劉好在有本領，遂把這許多魚，在每天的傍晚，全望池潭裏放，到明兒再去撈起放入沙缸中，可以安然無恙。</p>
<p>霉天的養魚家，都有這種感覺吧？好好的一缸魚，也沒有什麽病，突然的會得全體休息，停止呼吸（術語謂之「悶缸」），一條條的白了肚子浮到水面上來了，可是，返魂無術，祗有聽它夭折。</p>
<p>在霉天，事先預防，只有把缸小魚多的把來悉數放入淸水的池潭中，仍舊給食，不過要比較平時少放些，而陽光又不可不照射，可是又須注意到烈日能使水變熱，僅有在池面的空隙上架以蘆簾，空氣仍舊流通，熱度可以减低，魚才可以不致發霉，或起受凉的影響。</p>
<p>霉季中人感到不爽快，實在也就是金魚的危險期，過了霉天，魚就可以發育滋長，決無其他的險象發現了。</p>

<h3>「酒話」答煙橋</h3>
<p>— 陳詒先</p>
<p>近在新聞報新園林上讀烟橋先生的「酒話」一文，內言：「章君雲生設愼利酒號於中正東路，貯海外名釀甚富，且亦好飲。……越月，復來，云申報自由談載有陳君詒先『談酒』，同有劉伶之癖，頗欲與之作平原十日之飲，若言舶來佳釀，則英之『威司格』，法之『白闌地』，俱偕藏之三十餘年矣。並約於署中至武林小游，鹽橋有山陰老酒家『純號』，所沽異於常肆，不知陳君有此雅興否？曷往訪之。</p>
<p>余讀以上話，極感章君之意，惟余近來吃酒，大不如前，章君欲與余作平原十日之飲，殊不敢與之較量。三十年前，余在非園與甘翰臣飲酒，幾片餅干，以啤酒杯吃白蘭地或成司格，不滲水，每人可盡一瓶。近來酒量日减，則有三故：一，年齡已高，氣不如以前之盛，見大杯白蘭地，有望而生畏之意；二，近有痔疾，五年前開刀，至今未收口，不敢多吃；三，近來酒價太昂，劣酒不願吃，可吃之酒，吃得太多，實不勝其負擔。因此酒腸日窄、</p>
<p>余居杭時，每天下午例酒，皆吃老酒，抗戰八年，未離上海一步，越釀難來，遂改吃白酒。所居對過有同寳和酒店，其所售紹燒，尙有正味，余每日晚飯時約吃酒六兩光景，有客至，或有佳肴，則吃四川大麵兩三杯，大麯雖香，然太貴，不能多吃。上海老酒好者，實不易得，上月在戴亮吉先生處吃得一次好酒，戴君四川人，其菜極佳，是日余本欲與之要大她吃，乃一嘗老酒極爲香冽，遂爲盡量，此種佳釀，只可在友好家中得之。最近余與友人小游西湖，於六月五日去，十日（端節前一日）返，在朱恒昇酒店吃酒三次，雖不能稱好酒，然確爲山陰所釀，在上海已不易得。章早君所稱之鹽橋「純號」，余竟不知杭州有此酒家，他日孵湖，必一試飲之。</p>
<p>烟橋先生，聞名久矣，其著作常在報端得讀之，然無緣晤面。「酒話」中言：「飲酒須覓伴，諺云『酒逢知己千杯少。』確有此情味。」余於此極表同情。余在上海所有酒友中，能懂酒中之趣者，僅許伯遒一人，許君杭州人，善吹笛，有「笛王」之稱。余與伯遒吃酒，常常有酒伴太少之感。惟此事無意凑和則有味，正式請客聚會，則索然，質之烟橋先生，不知以爲何如？</p>
<h3>預測氣候</h3>
<p>— 珊詩</p>
<p>晚上天發紅，天必要晴；早晨天發紅，又發黑，今日必有風雨。」這雖是聖經中的一段記載，却有相當正確的科學根據。英文觀察雜誌列舉了下面幾條所謂老婆婆的經驗，頗饒興趣：</p>
<p>頭髮如果比平時柔軟些，預吿天將下雨；因爲高氣壓（天氣晴朗空氣乾燥）時的頭髮，常保持硬的狀態。</p>
<p>舊的創傷，如腐爛牙齒及足部腫脹等舊疾作惡時，顯示天將降雨，因爲低氣壓之故。</p>
<p>沒有露珠的天氣，很有下雨可能，因爲露珠的不能產生，是沒有雲的中心核粒來凝集它的緣故。</p>
<p>如果月亮周圍有模糊的暈，天將在四小時後下雨，因月暈是空中冰點或水氣折光而成。</p>
<p>黃色晚霞預吿次日天雨，因爲夕陽透過潮濕的空氣；紅色彩霞預吿次日晴朗，因爲陽光透過乾燥空氣的塵粒。</p>
<p>烟突冒出的烟如有向下的趨勢，預吿天雨，因爲烟在低氣壓的濕風下，不易上升。</p>
<p>天氣晴朗，烏禽高飛，因爲翅翼較乾，飛行極高。天如將雨，燕子低飛，因爲低氣壓擾亂牠們靈敏的聽覺。</p>
<p>海鷗停竚休息，是暴風雨來臨的警吿，因爲烏類易在低氣壓的稀薄空氣中疲倦。</p>
<p>中午時，如積雲逐漸烏黑低大，可能在黃昏時下雨；高空僅有積雲數朶，預告數日放晴。</p>
<h3>東鱗西爪</h3>
<p>— 蒼雨</p>
<p>美國布林頓撤謊俱樂部每年推舉世界撒謊大師一名。一九四七年的錦標爲聖·安多尼奧的J·霍浦萊所獲。他的故事是：當他玩擲球遊戯時，一隻蒼蠅飛來停在第八隻球上。他一彈擲去，第八號球應聲擎走，但那隻球去得極快，以致球上的蒼蠅失足跌到桌子上，跌斷了它的背椎骨。</p>
<p>世界上最古怪的一家旅館開設在菲洲英國殖民地貫雅市外十哩的一個叢林中。那家旅館建築在一顆大樹上，離地四十尺高。樹嶺旅館的旅客可以安全地在晨昏之際看到各種叢林猛獸到旅館前的池塘裏來飲水。那家旅館的房租每天五十美元，旅客自肯雅來往，都用武裝衛隊接送，不另收費。</p>
<h3>譽僧</h3>
<p>— 公孫午</p>
<p>王安石罷相後，撰楞嚴經疏解，詳諸師之略，略諸師之詳，有表一家識妙之處，惜其書不傳。王氏一大政治家，剛勇過人，或有得於佛法。臨川集中擬寒山拾得詩云，「勇有孟施舍，能無懼而已，若人學佛法，勇亦當如此。」陳灃亦以勇猛稱佛，所見則同，而世謂學佛者必「消極」，若王氏之變法，非所謂積極取。曾鞏亦闢佛者也，與王氏書，言佛經之亂俗，王答書云，「方今亂俗不在於佛，乃在於學士大夫沉沒利欲，以言相尙，不知自治而已。」其譽僧之論，謂「多寬平而不忮，質靜而無求，當士之夸漫盜奪，有已而無物者多於世，則超然高蹈。」又稱二僧云，「旣以其所學自脫於世之淫濁，而又皆有聰明辯智之才。」學佛者聰明辯智而不忮不求，夸漫盜奪者目爲消極，亦固其所。雖然，其言則有未盡，爲佛徒者，豈超然高蹈而已。</p>
<p>###</p>
<p>舉時代之考試，歷史深長，於政治於社會，具有重大意義，亦各有利有弊。</p>
<p>其社會的意義，爲破除階級，大衆身分地位各有機會發展　正平等。均貧富，齊貴賤，皆在乎此。譬如富商大農，平居享用優厚，資財亦能支配衆人，一旦涉訟，或被公役點派，則官府可施壓力，胥役得以勒索擾害，甚至家破人亡。但若他能爲子弟延師，嚴課文章，能應考試，只要得到一名「秀才」，卽是「身入　門」，官府的門生，政商農文各界對此一人一家的觀念待遇，卽有强大的角度之轉變。（秀才尙且如此，舉人進士更不待言。至於花錢捐得大宮，雖亦可支持門面，而各方面心情並不尊重。）</p>
<p>從另一面說，一個貧窮的孩子，只要能苦　，能文，得入「　門，自有些富農大買，爭先把女兒許配，或招贅家中，因爲家中若無讀書子弟，則招個秀才女　，亦足以光采門庭，「更有分給資產，供給。鄉會試一切，期待層樓更上，並可帶帮教導岳家子弟。而此貧寒子弟因科舉得意，不但成名，而且得利。故曰「書中自有顏如玉，書中自有黃金屋。」只要讀書，則不愁生活不優越。於是又有「窮人翻身」均貧富的妙用。</p>
<p>現在再舉個實例，卽如淸代最後一位鼎鼎大名蘇州狀元宰相陸潤庠鳳石先生，他的父親名嵩，做過鎭江府學的敎官，所謂「吃豆腐的官兒」，官味淸寒。鎭江古名「潤州」，府學裏有塊「鳳凰石景」，鳳老就生在老太爺的官舍，故名「潤庠」，字「鳳石」。（庠者庠序，卽學校也。）幼年隨父苦讀寒窗，至淸同治十二年癸酉科中式舉人。次年甲戍，聯捷成進士第一人，授職修撰，即於丙子科（光緒二年，距甲戍只隔一歲）春充會試同考官，其秋又放湖南主考，以欽差身分，一路地方官供張接送，到了洲省，升砲奏築，一切儀仗禮儀，與撫院平行敵體。迴想三年前還不過一個尋常的士子，眞是平步登天，置身靑雲之上！</p>
<p>戯劇裏如玉堂春之王金龍，以一落拓書生，因皇榜高中，而爲欽差按院。明制：一省大員兩院三司。兩院者，一爲巡撫，主吏治民生一切政務；一爲巡按，專管糾察彈劾瀆職官吏，到處接受控詞，申理寃案，如此劇之王按院是也。例以御史出巡，御史在明朝只七品官，（前淸升爲五品）而一爲欽差，即是「院體」，故藩臬兩司雖是二三品大員，老資格官僚，（即劇上之紅袍藍袍）進見則打躬參謁，升堂則侍坐兩旁（三司中還有都指揮司，因管軍政，故不列席），王金龍以落拓少年，遂居高位，享尊榮，雖是戯文，卻能寫實科塲扭轉，貧富貴賤破除階級之眞情實際。（王蘇等是否眞人眞事，案情　無異同，乃考證家之事，另一問題。）</p>
<p>在舊小說舊戯劇中，許多是警戒「嫌貧愛富」的豪門大戶，其貧婿一旦科舉高發，每每後悔無及，如此故事，不一而足。故又有口碑曰：「今年的秀才，明年的八合」。</p>
<p>若說人人都富貴，或者人人都勞苦，方爲平等，只是理想。但機會均等，便是平等了。</p>

<h3>Supervisory Yuan Holds Confirmation Vote; Twelve Grand Justices Chosen; Remaining Five Fail, Requesting President to Nominate Others; Examination Committee Confirmation Vote Scheduled for Today</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 14th] Of the seventeen Grand Justices nominated by the President, the Supervisory Yuan held its 18th general meeting on the 14th to conduct voting and exercise the right of confirmation. As a result, among the original seventeen nominees, Jiang Yong, Yan Shutang, Huang Youchang, Qi Chaojun, Zhang Shiyi, Li Boshen, Hong Wenlan, Hu Boyue, Zhang Yuxun, Lin Bin, Liu Kejun, and Shen Jiajun, twelve in total, have obtained more than half of the affirmative votes and have been elected as Grand Justices. Liu Tong, Shi Shangkuan, Chen Yiqing, Zhou Shuyun, and Zhang Yingnan received too few votes and could not be elected according to law. The Supervisory Yuan will submit the results of the vote to the President and request that the President nominate others for those who did not pass.</p>
<p>The meeting was held at 9:50 AM. Chairman Yu Youren, after reading the minutes of the previous meeting, solicited the opinions of all members on whether to proceed with the Grand Justice confirmation vote first or to hold the Examination Committee review meeting. The majority favored proceeding with the vote immediately, and the voting was announced. After all preparations were completed, voting began at 10:15 AM and was completed in half an hour. After a recess, the meeting resumed, and the Secretary-General reported the voting results. The President of the Yuan then reported the list of Grand Justices who had been elected with more than half of the affirmative votes, as well as the list of candidates for whom the President was requested to nominate replacements, before adjourning the meeting. It is noted that today's ballot count showed a particularly large number of invalid ballots. A total of 126 commissioners attended the vote today, and there were 126 ballots cast, but each person had invalid ballots in addition to votes of disapproval.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 14th] The President issued the following order on July 14th: Appointing Jiang Yong, Yan Shutang, Huang Youchang, Qi Chaojun, Zhang Shiyi, Li Boshen, Hu Boyue, Hong Wenlan, Zhang Zixun, Lin Bin, Liu Kejun, and Shen Jiajun as Grand Justices of the Judicial Yuan.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 14th] The Supervisory Yuan is scheduled to hold its 19th general meeting at 9:00 AM on the 15th, and will decide whether to proceed immediately with the voting to exercise the right of confirmation for the Examination Committee members. This is because the Supervisory Yuan conducted an extensive review of the qualifications of the Examination Committee members at 3:00 PM on the 14th. If necessary, the plenary review meeting will continue on the 15th, with individual reviews. However, it is widely believed that the voting on the Examination Committee members will definitely take place on the morning or afternoon of the 15th.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 14th] Judicial Yuan President Wang Chonghui and Vice President Shi Zhiquan held a tea party at the International Club at 5:30 PM on the 14th to entertain all Supervisory Commissioners for socializing.</p>
<h3>List of Elected and Non-Elected Grand Justices and Vote Counts</h3>
<p>The above twelve have all been elected as Grand Justices.</p>
<p>The above five have all failed to be elected Grand Justices due to not receiving a majority of votes.</p>
<h3>Jiang Yong Cables President to Urgently Request Giving Way to More Qualified Candidates</h3>
<p>[Our Report] The Supervisory Yuan exercised its right to confirm Grand Justices yesterday morning. As a result, twelve people, including Jiang Yong, were confirmed. According to Jiang Yong, he has not been interested in officialdom for a long time and has little research on the Constitution. He has cabled President Chiang to request giving way to more qualified candidates. The original cable is as follows: "To President Chiang, Nanjing: I heard that the Supervisory Yuan has already confirmed Yong's nomination as Grand Justice, which makes me deeply ashamed and fearful. Yong has not been interested in officialdom for a long time and has little research on the Constitution. I am not up to the task of Grand Justice. I earnestly request that our President refrain from appointing me and nominate another person. I pray for this with utmost sincerity. Jiang Yong, cold [14th]." Note: Ever since the news of the President's nomination of Jiang Yong as Grand Justice spread, Jiang Yong immediately wrote to Judicial Yuan President Wang Chonghui, requesting that he convey to the President not to nominate him. And when it was reported on the 13th that he had been formally nominated, he also wrote to Wu Dingchang and the Supervisory Yuan, requesting that he be removed from consideration. Now that the Supervisory Yuan has confirmed him, Jiang still has no intention of taking office and firmly requests giving way to more qualified candidates.</p>
<h3>Supervisory Yuan Issues Circular Telegram to Comfort Soldiers in Eastern Henan</h3>

Duanmu Jie chaired the meeting, and Xu Kan, Director of Budget, Guan Jiyu, Minister of Food, and Ling Hongxun, Vice Minister of Transportation, were all present. First, the seventh group read out the "written opinions of the subgroup review." Wang Puhan, convener of the transportation subgroup, also made an oral explanation. Then, the transportation department budget was discussed. After Vice Minister Ling explained his insightful views on the review opinions, the original proposal in the "written opinions of the subgroup review" was passed without objection. It is reported that the written opinions significantly increased the figures under the income items of the transportation department and reduced the expenditures. In particular, it corrected the fact that the salaries of personnel in state-owned enterprises under the Ministry of Transportation, such as China National Aviation Corporation, the Postal Remittances Bureau, and the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, were higher than those of general public and educational personnel. Subsequently, the food administration department budget was discussed. After reading out the subgroup review opinions, the discussion began. Minister Guan also made some explanations. However, the committee members criticized the food administration department a lot. The original review opinions considered the newly added 5 million hemp bags for transporting grain listed by the Ministry of Food to be excessive and reduced them by half. They also advocated for the abolition of the China Grain Corporation and a thorough investigation of its past business operations. After two hours of heated debate, the results were also passed according to the original review opinions. Furthermore, the convening members of the Budget Committee, recognizing the need to expedite the review process, reconvened at 4:00 PM on the 14th to study technical improvements. As a result, it was decided to proceed according to the procedure decided on the 13th, and to continue the "comprehensive review" on the 15th, but without notifying the heads of relevant ministries and commissions to attend and report, in order to save time.</p>

<h3>Draft Regulations on the Requisition of Assets of Nationals Abroad</h3>
<p>To be Submitted for Discussion at Tomorrow's Legislative Yuan Meeting</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 14th] Legislator Jian Guansan and 30 others recently proposed the "Draft Regulations on the Requisition and Appropriation of Deposits and Assets of Chinese People Abroad." They also attached seven reasons for the proposal and requested a public resolution. The seven reasons explained the rationality and necessity of requisitioning and appropriating the deposits and assets of nationals abroad in terms of our country's constitution, economic policies, national obligations, the examples of people donating gold during wartime and the British government appropriating overseas assets during wartime, as well as Chinese and foreign public opinion and bilateral agreements on economic assistance from the United States. The proposed draft regulations consist of 16 articles, the main points of which are: (1) Nationals (including natural persons and legal persons) with deposits and assets abroad worth more than US$10,000 shall report and register them within a limited time. (2) The foreign exchange assets of overseas Chinese shall be exempt from requisition and appropriation. (3) Any Chinese or foreign individual or group may report to the registration authority on those who fail to report within the time limit or make false reports. After verification, 40% of the amount discovered shall be awarded as a bonus. (4) For foreign exchange assets that have been applied for registration, the government may appropriate 30% by issuing public bonds, and the remaining amount shall be appropriated using a progressive system based on the excess amount. For balances exceeding US$15,000 but less than US$30,000, 10% shall be appropriated, increasing cumulatively until for balances exceeding US$3 million, 50% shall be appropriated. (5) The funds requisitioned and appropriated shall be limited to subsidizing agriculture, industry, construction, and education. (6) Those who register early and legal persons engaged in industry, mining, transportation, public utilities, and export trade may have the appropriation amount reduced. (7) Those who fail to report within the time limit or make false reports with the intention of concealing assets, shall, after verification, have all their foreign exchange assets confiscated and be sentenced to imprisonment for not less than five years and not more than ten years. When necessary, those who are abroad may be permanently banned from issuing passports for departure. (8) Those who fail to pay the amount of requisition and appropriation as stipulated shall be sentenced to imprisonment for not less than ten years or life imprisonment. This case will be submitted for discussion at the 20th meeting of the Legislative Yuan on the 16th.</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Stop Issuing New Banknotes? Or Increase the Issuance of Large Denomination Notes?</h3>
<p>According to news from financial authorities: The government has ordered the Central Bank to stop issuing banknotes in order to suppress the rising tide of prices. This is a welcome sound, and it is the desire of the general public that this is the absolute truth. However, at the same time, rumors about the issuance of so-called large denomination notes are still circulating in the market. Despite repeated denials from the relevant authorities, the general public speculates that, judging from past examples, this is just official rhetoric. Some even believe that, judging from the situation, the arrow is probably on the string, and it seems that large denomination notes have to be issued. Then, this ever-increasing currency problem is indeed worthy of everyone's attention.</p>
<p>Currently, cash is already being discounted, and on the one hand, the national banks are making large-scale purchases, while on the other hand, the Central Bank is releasing a large amount of materials in order to tighten the money supply. The authorities have their own plausible reasons for this approach, believing that this will help to suppress prices. However, from the perspective of the market, this is still nothing more than creating a situation to force the business community to automatically request it, as a good basis for the issuance of large denomination notes. Past experience tells us that this speculation does not seem to be without foundation.</p>
<p>Since the situation has turned to this point, whether large denomination notes should be issued and what impact they will have on prices seem to no longer need much discussion. Anyway, everyone agrees, and the authorities will certainly comply with public opinion and issue them immediately. Even if some people are too worried and still believe that this will stimulate prices, they may not be able to suppress it in the end, so that these large denomination notes will not be issued for a long time.</p>
<p>Indeed, there is not enough cash now, and counting and carrying it is too troublesome. Even if large denomination notes are not issued, the rising tide of prices may not be able to be suppressed for long. Because the rise in prices is due to the excessive amount of banknotes in circulation, the shrinking circulation area, and the too-fast turnover rate, and not simply due to the size of the banknotes. Therefore, the worry of stimulating prices may not resolutely cancel this matter.</p>
<p>Having said that, the rise in prices is indeed closely related to the amount of currency. President Weng once publicly stated this in the Legislative Yuan. Former Presidents Song and Zhang and the Minister of Finance also admitted this clearly and did not shy away from it. Therefore, issuing large denomination notes and increasing the currency will indeed stimulate prices and force them to rise, but stopping the issuance of large denomination notes and continuing to issue more small denomination notes, how can we stabilize the currency value and stabilize prices? Unless the central government has a great determination, from now on, to share a common understanding with the people, and never issue a single new banknote, regardless of the size of the banknote, it will be difficult to reverse the raging waves of prices.</p>
<p>Therefore, the focus of this problem is not on whether the rumored large denomination notes should be issued and when they should be issued, but on whether the government has the determination and means to resolutely stop the ever-increasing currency inflation. In other words, today's question is whether to stop issuing banknotes, not whether to issue new large denomination notes.</p>
<p>If the central government is still perfunctory and muddling through, without making a decision on the currency, then as a result of rising prices and higher costs, the so-called large denomination notes that are now planned to be issued will probably become small denomination notes again in a few months. At that time, the amount of banknotes issued will again be deemed insufficient. And counting and carrying them will still be considered too troublesome. At that time, another larger denomination banknote will inevitably arise in response to the times. Prices and banknotes, thus mutually cause and effect, circulate and appear, we really dare not imagine. We really don't know: should the country's currency, finance, and price policies continue to be allowed to evolve along this track?</p>
<p>We understand very well that the imbalance in financial revenue and expenditure is forcing the authorities to issue banknotes indiscriminately in order to meet urgent needs. The financial authorities also know the great disadvantages of issuing banknotes indiscriminately, but they are just doing this lazy job of printing money under the cover of the word "emergency"! I don't know that emergency is just emergency, and it can't be regarded as regular. There are many ways to increase revenue and reduce expenditure, and it is absolutely impossible to rely on issuing banknotes as the only way, and it is absolutely impossible to rely solely on printing banknotes as the only trick of the Minister of Finance! We have also repeatedly discussed the plan to make up for the deficit, and there are many suggestions from all sides on this. We absolutely do not believe that the country's finances have reached the point where they cannot be supported without issuing banknotes.</p>
<p>The ancients said: "If you don't hold it when it's dangerous, and you don't help it when it's falling, then what's the use of that minister!" The current issuance policy is indeed too dangerous and too dangerous, and it must be quickly supported. Those who are responsible should no longer sit idly by and take no action. It is even more inappropriate to take the slogan of suppressing the rebellion as a shield for issuing banknotes indiscriminately, and it is even more inappropriate to talk emptily about price stability, blame hoarding, and lightly push this major responsibility of inflating the currency completely onto the business community. As for the rumored large denomination notes, if they stop here and no larger denomination notes are found one after another in the future, we think this is not a big deal. If the policy of currency inflation is still followed and there is no intention to stop it, then, without waiting for the so-called large denomination notes, the medium and small denomination notes currently issued are enough to make the national economy and the people's livelihood devastated!</p>
<h3>Regarding the Arrest of Three Students from Zhongda University, The Capital Garrison Headquarters Announces the Arrest and Interrogation Process, The "Rescue Committee" Was Planned by Professional Students</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 14th] The spokesperson of the Capital Garrison Headquarters recently issued a statement regarding the arrest of Hua Binqing and other three people reported in today's newspaper, the organization of the National Central University Rescue Committee for Arrested Students by Zhongda University students, and the decision on six rescue measures, stating: The Headquarters recently received a report from the Capital Police Department; a resident named Zhou Shaoqing in Sandao Gengzi, Sanwen River, has extremely secretive activities, and at the same time, people with suspicious movements come and go from his home every day. Huang Zhuosheng and Chen Yongkang, two police officers from the Shizhenqiao Police Station under his jurisdiction, paid close attention to this matter. At 9 PM on the 5th, they saw four more people entering Zhou Shaoqing's home. Chen and Huang, the two police officers, dispatched police to arrest the four people, who fled in all directions. They were arrested one after another until 2 AM. However, Zhou Shaoqing escaped and has not been captured yet. At the same time, important documents such as meeting records were found in Zhou Shaoqing's home. After taking them to the station, one of the four people named Tao Ronggui confessed that he had contacted the students and agreed to meet at the Shangxinhe Beikou at 7 AM on the 6th of this month to send the student to Chaoxian County, Anhui. Chen and Huang, the two police officers, immediately waited at Beikou according to the confession. At 7 AM, they saw the student who contacted Tao Ronggui and two other students arriving at Beikou together. Chen and Huang, the two police officers, immediately stepped forward to question them and found some reactionary books, leaflets, accounts, etc. on the students. After taking them to the station for questioning, they learned that the three students were: Zhu Chengxue (Department of Law, Zhongda University), a Communist professional student; Li Fei (Department of Chemical Engineering, Zhongda University); and Hua Binqing (Department of Political Science, Zhongda University). They were immediately sent to the bureau for interrogation. The students realized that they could not hide their crimes, and they also admitted them without hesitation. They also confessed frankly in their confessions and regretted their illegal actions. They also secretly used social relations to rescue them from all sides. The Police Department considered the case to be of great importance and has transferred the evidence of the crime to the Special Criminal Court for handling according to law. Once the judgment is made, the entire case can be announced. The Rescue Committee organized by Zhongda University students is thought to be planned by Communist professional students, just as Commander-in-Chief Sun predicted in his last speech: "After this case occurs, the Communist bandits will inevitably create rumors, confuse the public, and then instigate turmoil to increase the difficulties of law enforcement agencies." The Headquarters eagerly hopes that students will maintain reason and abide by discipline and not be used by the Communist bandits.</p>

<h3>Western Allied Nations Protest the Blockade of Berlin, Moscow Submits a Response, British and American Air Transport Capabilities Greatly Enhanced</h3>
<p>[United Press, London, 14th] Soviet Ambassador to Britain, Zarubin, delivered Moscow's long-awaited response to the British, American, and French protests on the 14th. The nature of the Soviet response is not immediately known. The response was submitted as Western diplomats in Berlin expected an unfavorable reply. Zarubin handed the reply to Minister of State McNeil, nearly a week after the three countries demanded that the Soviet Union lift the "intolerable" blockade of Berlin. The most authoritative sources here expect the Soviet Union to propose reopening the Four Power talks on all German issues and abandoning the West German plan in response to the Western protest. However, the West does not intend to bargain before the Berlin blockade is lifted. Relations between East and West in Germany have reached a dead end, leading Western diplomats to unanimously recognize that the only solution is another attempt by senior officials, but they remain silent on official plans. Two months ago, they ridiculed the reopening of the Four Power Conference, but now they have changed to skepticism and do not deny the possibility of a new Foreign Ministers' meeting.</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 14th] Soviet Ambassador to the United States, Panyushkin, delivered the Soviet response to the State Department on the 14th.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 14th] The French Foreign Ministry received the Soviet response to France's protest regarding the Berlin incident at 12:30 PM today.</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 14th] Authoritative sources said that even if Moscow rejects the protest over the Berlin crisis, Britain, the United States, and France have agreed on a plan for joint action. The three countries are considering forcing Moscow to respond. It is reported that if the protests of the three countries are rejected, they will break the blockade with joint action. The three countries have drafted several methods in London. It is reported that possible actions include: (1) Submitting the Berlin dispute to the International Court of Justice in The Hague to establish the legality of the three countries' presence in Berlin and the right to transport supplies through the Soviet zone. (2) Having the Security Council consider the matter based on the provisions for investigating threats to peace. However, this move would not help the situation, as the Soviet Union has veto power. (3) Testing the Soviet blockade with force, which may be shelved due to being too dangerous. Officials still reflect hope that the Soviet Union will suddenly lift the blockade. Sources acknowledge that the situation is increasingly serious, but do not imply that the West is prepared to use force.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Berlin, 13th] Sources close to the Soviet military government say that Soviet Commander-in-Chief of the Soviet forces in Germany, Sokolovsky, will postpone his return to Berlin for several days because the Soviet response to the Western powers' protest against the Berlin blockade has not yet been drafted.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Berlin, 14th] Air transport between West Germany and Berlin is expected to increase due to improved weather. Air Force Minister Henderson announced today that since the start of the airlift on July 1, 2,000 supply planes have landed in Berlin. The Wunstorf Airport in the British zone of West Germany is insufficient, and another take-off base will be opened. Once completed, the number of airlifts can be further increased. The British-American Air Transport Joint Command announced that starting next week, the daily transport of supplies to Berlin, including food and coal, can be increased from the current 3,000 to 4,000 tons to 6,000 tons. Many C-54 Skymasters continue to fly from the United States to Frankfurt today to enhance air transport capabilities. There are now 30 Skymasters in Germany. Officials at Tempelhof Airport in the American sector of Berlin also said that the newly built runway that can accommodate B-29 aircraft will be completed soon, allowing large aircraft to take off and land.</p>

<p>Italian Communist Leader Togliatti</p>
<p>[Reported by our newspaper] Rome, 14th Broadcast: Italy has fallen into the biggest chaos since the end of the war after the assassination of the Communist leader Togliatti. Communist parties are demonstrating everywhere. The National Labor Union controlled by the Communist party has announced an indefinite strike. A large number of workers attacked the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, accusing the Ministry of Foreign Affairs as the "murderer." The police opened fire, killing and injuring dozens of people.</p>

<p>[Reported by our newspaper] New York, 14th Broadcast: The assassinated and wounded Italian Communist leader has now escaped danger.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Rome, 14th] Togliatti, the 54-year-old leader of the Italian Communist Party, was wounded in an assassination attempt this morning when leaving the Chamber of Deputies. He was taken to the hospital by ambulance in a coma. As soon as Togliatti left the side door of the parliament, he was shot four times by a young man in his thirties, with bullets entering Togliatti's chest. The assailant was arrested on the spot. After Togliatti was taken to the hospital, surgery was performed immediately. A recent bulletin from the doctor stated that "the injured person has undergone a blood transfusion. The most serious bullet wound is in the left chest under the armpit. The lungs appear to be fine. To avoid shock, there are two other wounds that have not been examined. The injured person has been injected with first aid drugs. Generally speaking, the injury is quite worrying."</p>
<p>Police announced that the assailant's name is Pallante, a 30-year-old student who confessed that he came to Rome from Randazzo, near Catania, and had been planning to assassinate Togliatti for a long time. After Togliatti was shot and fell to the ground, he was helped up, and his first question was whether his briefcase and documents were still there and whether the assailant had been arrested.</p>
<p>Unofficial reports say that the assailant, Pallante, is a fourth-year law student who claims not to belong to any political party. However, members of the Liberal Party in Rome said that Pallante was a member of the party and withdrew in 1946. It is said that the assailant admitted that he came to Rome specifically to assassinate this "enemy of the state." Unconfirmed reports say that the assailant had an older brother who died in the Soviet Union during the war. Interior Minister Scelba announced that the assailant's name may be Pallante or Talante.</p>
<h3>Italian General Confederation of Labor Launches National General Strike</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Rome, 14th] After Togliatti's assassination, the Italian General Confederation of Labor, led by the Communist Party, immediately ordered a general strike in Rome. Public transportation was the first to stop, followed by city employees. Workers began to set up blockades around factories, and were driven away by police with batons. Major public utilities such as gas, electricity, and water continue to operate as usual. The general strike has been brewing for many days, and Togliatti's assassination prompted its outbreak, forming the Communist Party's first response to the murder.</p>
<p>[United Press, Milan, 14th] The General Confederation of Labor here has also ordered a general strike, and labor is planning a large-scale demonstration. All officers have been ordered to concentrate and stand by.</p>
<h3>Prime Minister De Gasperi Visits the Hospital to Express His Condolences</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Rome, 14th] Italian Prime Minister De Gasperi personally visited the hospital at around 1:00 PM today to express his condolences to the assassinated and wounded Togliatti.

<h3>The United States Refutes Soviet Accusations</h3>
<p>The Berlin Air Force Did Not Violate Rules</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Berlin, 13th] U.S. Deputy Commander in Germany, Hayes, again rejected the protest alleging that the U.S. plane violated aviation safety rules in a letter to the Soviet Chief of Staff, Lukanchenko, today. Hayes said that he does not know what basis the Soviet side's statement that the flight of the U.S. plane was not approved by the Soviet side has, because the Allied equipment obviously has the absolute right to fly in the air corridor. Moreover, the flight schedule of the U.S. plane is published daily to publicly notify the members of the Berlin Aviation Safety Committee. In any case, it is obvious that the U.S. plane has never violated aviation safety rules.</p>

Canada and Belgium, which had previously opposed the US proposal, have now expressed their agreement.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Lake Success, 13th, United Press] Palestine mediator Bernadotte said today that the new ceasefire proposal for Palestine requires 2,000 to 2,500 observers to ensure that the ceasefire can be implemented as stipulated. Bernadotte spent more than an hour answering questions from Security Council representatives, including Soviet Representative Gromyko's sharp questions to Bernadotte. Britain supports the US proposal in principle, so it is very likely that the proposal will be approved by the Security Council. The US proposed that the Security Council order the Arabs and Jews to unconditionally agree to a ceasefire. If either side violates this order, the provisions of the UN Charter will be invoked to impose economic and military sanctions.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Lake Success, 13th] The US resolution requested that the Security Council immediately implement an unconditional ceasefire in the Jerusalem area.

<h3>Former Dutch Prime Minister Beel Ordered to Form New Cabinet</h3>
<p>[Reuters, The Hague, 14th] Dutch Regent Princess Juliana ordered former Prime Minister Beel today to form a new cabinet. Beel's original cabinet resigned in accordance with the constitution after the general election earlier this month. As a result of the general election, the Catholic Party and the Labor Party together occupy 59 seats in the House of Representatives, less than two-thirds of the majority. If they want to amend the constitution to determine the new relationship between Indonesia and the Netherlands, they must have the support of two-thirds of the majority, so it is expected that Beel will organize a cabinet with a broader base.</p>

<h3>Unprecedented Crisis for the Machine Ice Industry; High Costs, Slow Sales</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The refrigerated ice market in Shanghai during the summer has always been dominated by the machine ice industry. This year, natural ice (commonly known as "Chinese ice") from the Pudong area has passed the inspection of the Municipal Health Bureau and is allowed to be sold. Therefore, more than half of the machine ice market has been replaced by inexpensive natural ice. As for the machine ice industry itself, the import of ammonia is restricted, and its price has increased by 20 million times compared to before the war. Even domestically produced ammonia has increased to about 10 million times. In addition, electricity costs and wages have increased sharply, further increasing the cost. The price per ton has reached as high as 36 million yuan. Although the city's machine ice industry can still maintain a daily production of 420 tons, which is not much different from last year, actual sales are less than half, resulting in huge losses. Therefore, according to the industry, this summer is a severe crisis for the machine ice industry.</p>

<h3>Shanghai's "Yang Sister" Moved to District Prosecutor's Office for Examination; Physical Strength Gradually Declining; Source of Calories Worth Studying</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Zhang Dailin, the "Shanghai Yang Sister" who is a mystery of not eating, has been moved to the Shanghai Health Sanatorium near Hongqiao yesterday afternoon after being examined at the home of Dr. Hua Shujun for 25 days.

She became ill in the past two days, which caused her to vomit after eating bananas. The doctors participating in the examination tried to induce her to eat other foods, but Zhang refused. The reason for moving to the Health Sanatorium yesterday was because the place was larger, the equipment was more complete, and Zhang herself was very willing to go, it was said. Also, Drs. Zhang Hongde, Gu Lida, and others who participated in the examination at Hua's residence issued a report yesterday, the main points of which were: (1) There were always two or three people watching Zhang Dailin for 25 days, proving that Zhang did not eat any other food except for eating a few bananas or apples every three days.

<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The Shanghai Postal Administration, in view of the fact that airmail letters are too heavy due to the use of too many stamps, and that the stamps often fall off en route, has ordered a postage meter from the United Kingdom to remedy the situation. It is specially used for domestic and foreign airmail letters. All thin letters with postage not exceeding one million yuan can be taken to the business section on the second floor of the bureau at the Sichuan Road Bridge to pay the postage, and a postage imprint of the same value will be stamped on the letter. The opening hours are tentatively set from 8:30 AM to 12:00 PM and from 2:00 PM to 6:00 PM every day, except on Sundays and holidays.</p>
<h3>Registration of Charity Houses Completed; Second Phase Decided to Continue</h3>
<p>The registration for the A and B types of charity houses sold by the Charity House Sale Department of the previous Winter Relief Association will end today. All of the winners who had not registered yesterday have completed the registration procedures at the association. Therefore, as of now, all 100 winners of types A and B have completed the registration. After the winners of the final registration receive their "House Receipt Certificates" within a few days, they can move into their new houses, and the sale of these two types of charity houses can be declared over. Also, in order to unify the management of 100 charity houses, the association has appointed Yuan Zhenkang as the general manager. In the future, the winners of the charity houses can contact him directly if they have any questions. Also, the rumor that the preparations for the second phase of the charity house sale will be aborted is not accurate. Mayor Wu is determined to continue the project in order to solve the housing shortage in the city. However, due to the difficulty of purchasing land, there are no concrete results at present.</p>

<h3>The "Thin Knife Gang" Affects Public Safety; Police Bureau Determined to Eradicate Them; Groups of Three to Five Form Deadly Cliques, Specializing in Seeking Revenge and Fighting for Others</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Recently, a so-called "Thin Knife Gang" has been discovered in the city, constantly causing disturbances and acting lawlessly. The Criminal Investigation Section of the Police Bureau has arrested more than twenty key members of the gang. The weapons they use are sharp blades about one foot long and weighing over two pounds, made by Xu Tongxing and Hong Changxiang and other knife shops on Guangdong Road. Sixty-one knives have been sold so far, but only twenty have been recovered by the police. Currently, in addition to warning the knife shops not to manufacture such weapons in the future, the police bureau is also making every effort to investigate and crack down on the gang. It is reported that the gang is called the "Thin Knife Gang" because most of the weapons they carry are thin knives. In reality, there is no formal organization. They are merely groups of three to five vegetable vendors, meat vendors, fish vendors, rickshaw pullers, and general unemployed vagrants, using gang organizations as a cover to secretly form deadly cliques specializing in seeking revenge and fighting for others, becoming a kind of professional thug. They are mostly distributed in Yangshupu, Jiangpu Road, Zhabei, Xinqiao Road in the Nanshi area, and have recently committed numerous crimes. The most vicious ringleaders, Wei Maogou, Du Xiaomao, and Yang Ming, have not yet been apprehended. These people are disrupting social order and affecting public safety.

<h3>China's First High-Speed Train is Born in Changzhou</h3>
<p>— Our reporter Li Tianxing</p>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper in Wujin, 11th] It has been publicized in the press that the Qiji Factory has completed the newly built "Adiabatic Train." To this end, the reporter made a special trip to visit the factory with a comrade.</p>
<p>Qiji Factory Along the Train</p>
<p>The factory is located about half a mile west of Qishuyan Town. The factory is named after the place. It is located in the center of the Shanghai-Nanjing Railway. Its predecessor was the Wusong Factory. It was moved here in 1937. One reason is that the location is suitable, and it is also near the Qishuyan Power Plant, making it easy to obtain electricity. Before the war, there were more than 1,500 employees. During the occupation, it was under the management of the puppet Central China Railway Bureau. After the victory, the property was returned to its original owner. After several years of recovery, there are now more than 3,000 employees, covering an area of more than 507,500 square meters. The total building area of the workshops is more than 32,400 square feet. The new and old buildings of all employee dormitories and other houses are about 800 rooms. The houses are adjacent to each other, forming a lively factory area. The number of workers and their families is nearly 10,000.</p>
<p>Internal Organizations of the Factory</p>
<p>The internal organization is mainly composed of four units: "Drawing," "Laboratory," "Training," and "Inspection," all under the "Technical Section." The "Supervision" and "Inspection" departments are directly responsible to the factory director. The work sections are divided into three groups: "Locomotive," "Vehicle," and "General." The equipment is divided into more than a dozen workshops: "Assembly," "Passenger Car," "Freight Car," "Boiler," "Repair," "Electrical," "Tool," "Automobile," "Subsidiary," "Sawmill," and "Material Testing." In addition, there are two educational institutions: a apprentice training class and a Rotary elementary school. In addition to a railway hospital, welfare programs such as sports and material distribution are managed by an organization. The factory buildings are lined up, and steel is everywhere. The sound of wheels turning, the sound of hammers, the creative atmosphere, and the smell of forging fill the hard picture and strong notes. Electricity, heat, and force, plus ideals, plus labor, are organized and performed. The scene is quite inspiring. The factory director, Gao Zhenzhou, is a tall man, a middle-aged Northerner in his forties, with ideals, perseverance, and boldness.</p>
<p>A Word from the Factory Director</p>
<p>After giving a welcome speech, Director Gao went on to explain the process of resolutely building this "China's First Train": He said, "In order to improve the quality of Chinese trains and to consider the facilities that passengers should have during their journey, we use our ideals to realize this train. The initial success is now achieved. But in order to have the train ready on time on July 15, everything is being rushed, and there are still many areas that are not ideal." He also said, "As of now, this new train is China's first train!" Then, a young engineer, Wang Guangyu, gave a further explanation of the new train.</p>
<p>Engineer's Explanation</p>
<p>Engineer Wang, a native of Liaoning, gave a further explanation of this new train with a very familiar and friendly attitude: According to him, there are many names for the newly built train in the outside world: Luxury Train, Adiabatic Train, Streamlined Train, but they are actually the same thing, that is, a high-speed train. When the factory was taken over, the total number of first, second, third, and fourth class vehicles was only 200, which was not enough. The first stage of the factory's three-year project was to increase the quantity. Now there are 600 vehicles, which is enough. Now the plan is to improve the quality. This so-called streamlined train is actually the first step in the ideal improvement of first-class cars. Continue to improve the second and third class vehicles.</p>
<p>Five Characteristics of the Train</p>
<p>The first valuable point of this "China's First Train" trial production is that 95% of the materials are locally sourced and manufactured by ourselves, with very little reliance on foreign countries. Features: (1) The car body is entirely welded, without any tacks, and the overall body is smooth and lovely. (2) Insulation: The air inside the car is isolated from the outside air. Electrical equipment is used to maintain a suitable temperature inside the car. On a hot day, it is constantly maintained at a gentle temperature 14 to 15 degrees lower than the outside, making people comfortable. Conversely, it also has insulation and adjustment in winter. (3) The seats all face forward. The seats have three angles. You can sit, lie down, or recline at will. When necessary, you can also turn around and talk to your friends behind you. Rotating and stretching is very comfortable. It guarantees passengers a considerable amount of comfort. (4) The bearings are all equipped with rollers, which can increase the speed. (5) The car door is connected to the steps. When the door is opened, there are steps to come down. When the door is closed, the steps disappear, which can reduce danger.</p>
<p>Ten New Cars in Total</p>
<p>A total of ten new cars were manufactured. Each car is 20 meters long, which is longer than the current car. In terms of appearance, from the front of the car to the last, everything is new. Among the ten cars, six are passenger cars, one is equipped with a generator, equipped with a diesel small powerful generator with a power generation of 100KW. The baggage room, mail room, conductor's room, telephone room, and broadcasting room are almost the entire nervous system of the car. The conductor can issue orders here and command the entire car. One is a dining car, with exquisite tables, about a dozen large and small. One end is equipped with electric stoves, electric ovens, and refrigerators. The supply of cold drinks and hot food is no problem. The delivery of food and tea is all scientifically and hygienically managed. There is sterilization equipment for used towels. The last car is an observation car, with a living room, sofas, and seats in the middle, specially for passengers to leisurely look at the scenery outside the suburbs, sit and chat, and listen to the radio.</p>
<h3>Fire Breaks Out in the Qiji Factory Workshop; Old Woman and Young Girl Buried in the Flames</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper in Wujin, 12th] A worker's dormitory in the Qishuyan Factory caught fire accidentally on the morning of the 12th. A large number of matches and firewood were placed in the house. The fire was very fierce. An old woman on the second floor was unable to escape and jumped from the building and fell to her death. Another young girl was buried in the flames because she did not have time to escape while trying to retrieve her belongings. The fire brigade extinguished the fire in time to prevent it from spreading.</p>
<h3>Huzhou in Uproar Over Night Soil Issue</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper in Wuxing, 12th] The city has been in an uproar over the night soil issue recently. The excrement of the city's population of more than 50,000 is seen as a piece of fat meat, and there are many who intend to monopolize it, causing a huge controversy. The county government ordered the health institute to try it out, but all the town's representatives believed that night soil was a legitimate source of income for the town government. After convening a town 保長 meeting, they decided to continue to do so. On the 12th, Director Wan went to take over but failed.</p>
<h3>Two Rickshaw Pullers in Shenyang Die Suddenly from Cholera</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper in Shenyang, 13th] Cheng Yu, a rickshaw puller in the Nanshi District, suddenly died on the street on the afternoon of the 12th from cholera. Also, Cao Zhong, a 50-year-old rickshaw puller in the Beiling District, felt abdominal pain and vomiting at 4 PM on the same afternoon and died after a while.</p>
<h3>Shanghai People in Hong Kong</h3>
<p>— Our special reporter Zi Jian</p>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper in Hong Kong, 11th] The number of people coming to Hong Kong from Shanghai is increasing day by day. They unknowingly form a society of their own and also affect the original society, as if new blood has been transfused. A friend from Shanghai said: "Guangdong people come to Hong Kong to 'make a living', and Shanghai people come to Hong Kong to 'escape the world'. The former comes to make money, and the latter comes to spend money (at least some of them do). The former's living capital is based on the national currency, while the latter's luggage is full of US dollars or gold."</p>
<p>The extravagant spending habits of Shanghai people have generally surprised the average Hong Kong people in the past year or two. Most of Hong Kong's wealthy people started from "hard work and frugality." Even now, there is a popular story in the private sector about a wealthy businessman, so-and-so, walking on foot. When they see Shanghai people who have "fled the disaster" buying land worth hundreds of thousands of dollars, building factories worth one or two million dollars or houses worth hundreds of thousands of dollars, and having brand-new cars and gorgeously dressed concubines, how can they not "look at them with new eyes?"</p>
<p>Some stores opened by foreigners in Hong Kong used to be frequented by only a few high-class Chinese, but now they are surrounded by "Shanghai gentlemen" and "Shanghai ladies." The most expensive British silverware, even George VI of Buckingham Palace in London would not easily be able to buy, and the British occasionally send three or two pieces to Hong Kong in order to earn foreign exchange. Within half an hour, they are all snapped up by our wealthy fellow villagers. Those who arrive late are willing to pay a deposit first and pre-purchase the goods that will arrive on the next ship. A blue-eyed Manageress who is familiar with the psychology of the Chinese people told the reporter: "You Shanghai people are really rich!" The reporter couldn't help but sweat when he heard this!</p>

<h3>Tightening of Credit and Strict Inspection Cause Prices to Fall Across the Board; Severe Shortage of Cash in the Market; Promissory Notes Require a Discount</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Yesterday, due to the tightening of credit, prices in the city fell across the board. Many Chinese stocks hit the limit down. Rice flour and oil and grains also fell sharply due to the tight credit and the authorities' strict inspection of warehouses, which caused panic and the release of hoarded goods. The market price of rice fell by an average of 1 million yuan, and the market price of high-quality white rice has retreated to the 30 million mark. Cotton yarn and cloth prices also fell by an average of 10% due to the extremely tight credit and the impact of the general decline in prices. Other commodities, such as silk, cigarettes, and daily necessities, also saw a sharp drop in wholesale prices. Business circles are closely watching the authorities' two policies of inspecting warehouses and selling goods. In particular, the establishment of the Materials and Finance Committee by the National Bank proves that the government has the determination to use US aid and other materials in its possession to stabilize prices, so they are all wary. The future price trend depends on the extent of the financial authorities' efforts to implement this policy.</p>
<p>Also, due to the National Bank's large-scale tightening of credit yesterday, there was a severe shortage of chips in the market. The discount on promissory notes increased from 5% to 8%. The bank felt the difficulties in its business and contacted the National Bank, hoping to receive cash assistance. However, it is generally speculated that the National Bank will use the opportunity of paying wages in mid-month to force industrial and commercial enterprises to sell goods in order to stabilize prices.</p>
<h3>National Bank Establishes Materials and Finance Committee to Control Materials Allocation Market; Inaugural Meeting Held Yesterday; Li Lixia Appointed as Convener</h3>
<p>[Our Report] The Central Bank, in order to cooperate with the government in controlling the materials allocation market, decided to establish a Materials and Finance Committee to be responsible for handling matters such as the design, review, and assessment of materials allocation. The bank appointed seven individuals, including heads of relevant bureaus and departments Li Lixia, Xia Jinxiong, Wang Zhonglin, Chong Yong, Wu Changfu, Chen Shuzeng, and Zhou Shunxin, as well as Yu Ruxin, manager of the purchasing department of the China Trust Bureau, as members, with Li Lixia as the convener. The committee held its inaugural meeting at 10:00 AM yesterday, where it amended and passed the organizational regulations and key business points. It was also learned that the utilization of U.S. aid materials, which is handled by the National Bank, will be centrally designed and distributed by the committee, and the sale of all materials will also be handled uniformly by the committee. However, the bookkeeping and handling procedures will still be managed by the Business Bureau of the National Bank. It is reported that future materials allocation work will adopt a barter system to minimize the use of legal tender. The ultimate goal is to enable the government-controlled cotton yarn, sugar, and salt to be exchanged for food, which will be supplied for distribution in major cities. The handling of various materials will still be managed by the original agencies, with the National Bank only providing assistance in its capacity as the issuing authority and agent of the national treasury. The current work of the Materials and Finance Committee is to transport cotton yarn and food from Central and Southern China to North China, and to transport coal and salt back to Central and South China, which will then be exchanged for food.</p>
<h3>Cotton Yarn Control Committee Renamed</h3>
<p>[Our Report] The Cotton Yarn Control Committee has recently been ordered by the Ministry of Industry and Commerce to change its name to "National Cotton Yarn and Cloth Management Committee of the Ministry of Industry and Commerce" starting from the 16th of this month.</p>

Acting Chairman Wang Lanseng ordered the appointment of Pan Jianliang, director of the Procurement and Transportation Department of the committee, to participate, and instructed him to report on the progress of his work at any time.</p>
<h3>Application for Import of Raw Materials for Cotton Cloth Manufacture Not Allowed</h3>
<p>The Promotion Department of the Import-Export Control Committee, regarding the issue of manufacturers exporting cotton textiles and applying for the import of raw materials for manufacturing in accordance with the "Measures for Importing Raw Materials for Export Products," convened a meeting of all relevant parties at the department a few days ago to discuss the matter. Representatives from the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, the Textile Export Committee, the China Trust Bureau, and the China Textile Company attended the meeting. After discussions, it was concluded that manufacturers exporting cotton yarn and cotton cloth, as they are materials prohibited from export by the government, may not apply for the import of raw materials for manufacturing by citing the "Measures for Importing Raw Materials for Export Products." All applications should be handled with the Export Committee. As for the export of other cotton textiles, as they are not within the scope of prohibited exports, they may still apply to the Promotion Department of the Import-Export Control Committee for the raw materials required for their manufacture in accordance with the prescribed measures.</p>

<h3>Ministry of Education Counselor Liu Meets with Yunnan Chairman to Discuss Ways to Resolve Student Unrest; Students Forcibly Occupying Yunnan University Ordered to Vacate</h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Kunming, 14th] Liu Yingshi, Counselor of the Ministry of Education, has been extremely busy since arriving in Kunming only a day ago. On the morning of the 14th, he exchanged views with Chairman Chu and Commander-in-Chief He on how to resolve the student unrest in Kunming. To this day, he still feels at a loss as to where to start. This afternoon, reporters visited Liu at the Ministry of Education. According to Liu, this trip is a mission to understand the actual situation. The Ministry of Education can only handle the administrative part of the school. Other parts related to public security and order have their own responsibilities, so it is inconvenient to intervene. Liu said that the student unrest in Kunming has deteriorated. It is neither a riot nor a revolution, let alone a strike. During the holidays, they are acting arbitrarily. The Ministry of Education cannot sit idly by. He has ordered the authorities of Yunda Nan and other universities that have been forcibly occupied to order students from other schools and non-students to evacuate immediately, and instructed all schools to be responsible for persuading students to leave to avoid trouble. Liu has no intention of contacting student representatives and is willing to listen to opinions from local elders, gentry, and public opinion organs to seek solutions. The duration of his stay in Kunming is undecided. Judging from the current situation, he feels very棘手. However, he will do his best. Currently, large posters have been posted on the walls of Yunda, hoping that Counselor Liu will visit the school to give instructions and make three requests: (1) Release the arrested students, (2) Please do not continue to adopt encirclement actions, (3) Guarantee the safety of students, etc. Liu remains silent on this matter, and the future development is difficult to predict.</p>

<h3>Method for Generating Basketball Champions in This Year's World Games: Elimination After Group Stage Round Robin</h3>
<p>[Our Special Dispatch] Basketball is the most important event in this year's World Games. From July 30th—the day after the official start of the World Games—until the closing day on August 14th, there will be matches every morning, afternoon, and even evening, except for Sundays.</p>
<p>Although basketball is extremely popular worldwide, it only has two editions of history in the World Games (it was officially included as a competition event during the 11th World Games in Berlin in 1936). The first edition had 23 participating countries, adopting a double-knockout system. The teams eliminated in the first week held consolation matches with each other, and the winners still had the opportunity to compete with the winning teams from the first week. While the method was considered fair, there were many loopholes. For example, although the Philippines defeated Mexico in the second week of the preliminary round, they were eliminated by the strong team from the United States in the first week of the playoffs. Mexico, however, entered the semi-finals due to weak opponents and ended up getting third place, while the Philippines ranked fifth. Japan also defeated Poland but failed to participate in the playoffs. Poland, on the other hand, got fourth place due to Peru's withdrawal. In light of this, the International Amateur Basketball Federation, responsible for all competition matters, decided to switch to a round-robin elimination system from this year onwards after a long period of discussion.</p>
<p>Round-Robin Elimination</p>
<p>The so-called round-robin elimination system is divided into two parts. The first part, the preliminary round, adopts a group stage round-robin system. If there are 24 or fewer participating units, they will be divided into four groups. The top four teams from the previous edition, USA, Canada, Mexico, and Poland, will be the seeded teams for groups one, two, three, and four, respectively. The other teams will be drawn into each group. Each team gets two points for a win, one point for a loss, and zero points for a default. After a week of competition, the top two teams with the most points in each group will qualify for the second part of the competition.</p>
<p>The second part of the competition adopts an elimination system, with the champions of each group as seeded teams. The runners-up of each group will be drawn separately, but the principle is not to compete against the first-place team from the same group. In the final four-team playoffs, the winning two teams will compete for the championship and runner-up, and the losers will compete for the third and fourth places. The third and fourth places of each group in the round robin will form another elimination tournament to determine the ninth to sixteenth places. The remaining teams will form another elimination tournament to determine the seventeenth place and beyond.</p>
<p>Divide Into Eight Groups for 25 or More Teams</p>
<p>If there are 25 or more participating teams, the preliminary round robin will be divided into eight groups. According to the results of the previous World Games basketball competition and the 1947 South American and European Championships, (1) the United States, (2) Canada, (3) Mexico, (4) Poland, (5) the Philippines, (6) Uruguay, (7) the 1947 European Champion, and (8) the 1947 South American Champion will be the seeded teams for each group. The other teams will still be drawn into the groups.</p>
<p>The second part elimination tournament will still be participated in by the top two teams from each group. The champions of the first, second, and third groups will be the top three seeds. After the champions of the other five groups are drawn to determine their rankings, they will be drawn in according to the aforementioned method, under the principle that the top two teams in the same group will no longer fight each other. This battle will follow the elimination competition method to determine the champion, runner-up, third place, and fourth place.</p>
<p>Although the round-robin elimination system still has its drawbacks—if country A is in a group with a strong team, country B, in addition to the seeded team, it will be extremely difficult for country A to have any hope of entering the second part of the competition. However, at the same time, country C, whose strength is inferior to country A, may be in another group where everyone other than the seeded team is mediocre, and country C may obtain the playoff qualification—it is more perfect than the double-knockout system, which only requires a bye in the first week to enter the playoffs. In fact, it is absolutely impossible to have a perfect system for a competition that must be completed in such a short period of time. (Xin)</p>

Before the match, the Chinese football team members and the surrounding spectators cheered each other, creating a very harmonious atmosphere.</p>
<h3>Grade A Tennis League: Jin Lan vs. Green Light Set for Fierce Battle Today</h3>
<p>Today is the sixth round of the Grade A Tennis League, with three matches as usual. The strengths of En Pai and You Lian are evenly matched, making the outcome difficult to predict. Jin Lan and Green Light face off, with Green Light lagging behind by more than twenty points. To strive for future rankings, Jin Lan will surely engage in a fierce battle today when they meet Green Light. It is hoped that Zhonghua will triumph at Tiyun's home court. However, due to yesterday's rain, each home and away team should contact each other to determine whether the venue is available. Order listed below:</p>
<p>You Lian — En Pai at You Lian</p>
<p>Green Light — Jin Lan at Green Light</p>
<p>Tiyun — Zhonghua at Tiyun</p>
<p>Also, in the first round of the Grade B League, there is still one match between Lian Mei and the Railway Team that has not been recorded and sent in. If it has not yet been held, it is hoped that a make-up match will be arranged immediately. Yesterday's fifth round of the Grade B League could not be played due to rain all day. It is hoped that a make-up match date will be set quickly.</p>

<h3>"Document Travels"</h3>
<p>— Ping Zhai</p>
<p>A few days ago, I saw in the newspaper that Chairman Chen of Zhejiang Province was reforming the document system, striving for simple and agile writing. I would really like to know how his trial is going.</p>
<p>I once saw an official document in a certain government agency. It was rolled up and covered with the stamps of eighteen handlers in a greasy, red mess. The content of this document was an extremely small and routine matter. I thought to myself, this can be called "the grand spectacle of bureaucratic politics," and couldn't help but laugh. Unexpectedly, a few days ago, I talked about this with a relative, and found that I was still a country bumpkin after all!</p>
<p>My relative works as a secretary in a national economic control agency, and is kicking and screaming about official documents all day long. According to her, she once saw a document with 58 stamps on it, and the final decision was the truly deserving "postpone." But this is not surprising. It is said that there was an employee who submitted a request for sick leave. This request "traveled" for many days, and when it was approved, the little employee who requested the leave had already been buried!</p>
<p>Why must official documents "travel" so laboriously? It is said that the agency is large, and there are many departments. If the stamps are not affixed, many things will not be known to all departments, and there may be loopholes in the processing. It seems to make sense, but the directors of our agencies all write small notes to add people or allocate funds. Even though this document should be delayed at many "stations" along the way, and there are people at each "station" holding stamps to be affixed, this small note flies right over them, arriving directly at the hand of the person ordered to execute it in the form of airmail. The departments may not fail to connect, and there may not be loopholes in the processing.</p>
<p>"Document travel" is also quite impressive in foreign countries. I just saw a new foreign magazine that said that there is a very confidential intelligence agency in the United States that uses a lot of funds, but the intelligence that this agency analyzes and organizes is all from six or seven months ago! The article also said that members of the U.S. Congress recently learned the truth and were quite surprised. This speed of "document travel" is really admirable: I admire their patience!</p>
<p>Therefore, thinking about the "handwritten orders" of the directors of our agencies, which are always high in power and above everything else, and President Roosevelt's often lightning-fast dispatch of special envoys, although they have been subject to a lot of criticism, are actually excusable.</p>
<p>I think that although our officialdom has always emphasized "skill" and paid attention to "posture," it would probably be a bit of a wrong to say that the directors deliberately hope to delay official business to the point of making people itch. I think there is a reason why "document travel" is so widespread: if you have ever had experience dealing with government agencies about money, you will never forget how difficult it is to receive a payment—today "the official business has not been approved," tomorrow "the official business has not arrived." Despite the price of goods jumping several times a day, the "slowly shout" of official documents remains the same. Do you want the official documents to "travel" sooner and get the money sooner? What's so difficult about that! A short break at the coffee shop, a "kowtow" to agree, and the official document will arrive immediately.</p>
<p>The "wonderful use" of "document travel" is probably in this kind of place.</p>
<h3>Raising Fish in Moldy Weather</h3>
<p>— Wu Jiren</p>
<p>Every household experiences rain during the plum rain season. The storms of these past few days have severely threatened the things we grow and the goldfish we raise on the farm. In particular, the hundreds of tanks of goldfish, large and small, are in danger. Fortunately, the "old fish slave"—Old Liu—who raises them has decades of experience in raising fish, and he has managed to turn the tide and get them through this difficult time.</p>
<p>Raising fish in moldy weather is really difficult, because the air pressure is too low during this period. The fish in the tanks cannot withstand this suffocating atmosphere. Fortunately, Old Liu has the ability to release all these fish into the pond every evening, and then scoop them up and put them back into the sand tanks the next day, so they can be safe and sound.</p>
<p>All fish farmers feel this way in moldy weather, right? A good tank of fish, without any disease, will suddenly rest as a whole and stop breathing (in technical terms, "suffocation"), turning white and floating to the surface of the water one by one. However, there is no way to revive them, and they can only be allowed to die prematurely.</p>
<p>In moldy weather, the only way to prevent it is to put all the small fish in the tanks into clear ponds and continue to feed them, but in smaller quantities than usual. Sunlight cannot be avoided, but you must also pay attention to the fact that the scorching sun can make the water hot. Only by placing reed curtains over the gaps on the surface of the pond, air can still circulate, the heat can be reduced, and the fish will not become moldy or be affected by the cold.</p>
<p>People feel uncomfortable during the moldy season, which is also the dangerous period for goldfish. After the moldy weather passes, the fish can develop and grow, and there will be no other dangerous signs.</p>
<p>When San Yuan Shi Zhang was returned to Hangzhou for burial, I was unable to go due to official duties. I specially took Pu Xin Yu to worship at the grave on Xu Village Arch Mountain. Feeling inspired, I wrote a poem. Cao Jingtao</p>
<p>The beacon smoke blocked the stars and frost. I was finally glad to return the flags to the old collection. Qu Yuan mourned his homeland. His writing illuminated a generation. The famous mountain and a piece of stone tablet left a trace of virtuousness. My humble residence left a poem to express my sadness. (My humble residence has many of his calligraphy.) Today, the Eastern Chu accompanied Ruzi, and I will leave a good tree to express my fragrance. (On this day, Xin Yu picked a branch of arbutus in the cemetery and wrote about it when he returned.)</p>
<p>Zhou Shutao Sent Me the Collection of Yu Xuanji from the Jing Song Dynasty, and I Wrote a Poem of Thanks</p>
<p>Collecting ancient books and paying them away vaguely, thousands of yuan and hundreds of songs are scattered like smoke, leaving the Peng Ben still intact, and I quickly saw fifty poems by Yu.</p>
<p>The old master of the book collection in the past, the inscription poems are the most exquisite, and the thousands of images of Lu You are vividly in front of me, with a sad look on his eyebrows and beard. (Han Yun himself signed the master of the Song Bookstore, and his portrait was published at the beginning of the book.)</p>
<p>I wandered around with melancholy thoughts, and once I opened the seal, I was overjoyed, and it was a beautiful woman who was hard to get again, and the lone copy in the world returned the fragrance of souls.</p>
<h3>"Wine Talk" Reply to Yan Qiao</h3>
<p>— Chen Yixian</p>
<p>Recently, I read Mr. Yan Qiao's "Wine Talk" in the New Garden of the News, which said: "Mr. Zhang Yunsheng set up Shenli Wine Company on Zhongzheng East Road, which stores a wealth of famous overseas wines and also likes to drink. ...A month later, he came again and said that the Free Talk of the Shen Bao published Mr. Chen Yixian's "Talking About Wine," which also has Liu Ling's addiction. I would like to have a ten-day drink in Pingyuan with him. If we talk about imported fine wines, then the English 'Whiskey' and the French 'Brandy' have been stored for more than 30 years. He also made an appointment to visit Wulin from the office, and Yanjing has an old Shaoxing wine shop 'Chunhao,' which is different from the usual shops. I wonder if Mr. Chen has this elegant interest? Why not visit it?"</p>
<p>After reading the above words, I am very grateful to Mr. Zhang for his intentions. However, I have not been drinking as much as before recently. I dare not compete with Mr. Zhang for a ten-day drink in Pingyuan. Thirty years ago, I drank with Gan Hansen in Feiyuan. A few pieces of biscuits were used to drink brandy or whiskey with beer glasses. Without adding water, each person could drink a bottle. Recently, my alcohol tolerance has decreased, and there are three reasons for this: first, I am getting older, and my energy is not as strong as before. I have a sense of fear when I see a big glass of brandy; second, I have hemorrhoids recently. I had surgery five years ago, and the wound has not healed yet. I dare not eat too much; third, the price of wine has been too high recently. I don't want to drink inferior wine, and I can't afford to drink too much of the wine that I can drink. Therefore, my alcohol tolerance has become narrower and narrower.</p>
<p>When I lived in Hangzhou, I drank Shaoxing wine every afternoon as a routine. During the eight years of the Anti-Japanese War, I did not leave Shanghai for a single step. It was difficult to get Shaoxing wine, so I switched to drinking white wine. There is a Tongbaohe Hotel opposite my residence, and the Shaoxing wine it sells still has a true taste. I usually drink about six ounces of wine every evening during dinner. If there are guests or delicious dishes, I drink two or three cups of Sichuan Daqu. Although Daqu is fragrant, it is too expensive to drink a lot. It is really not easy to get good Shaoxing wine in Shanghai. Last month, I had a good drink at Mr. Dai Liangji's place. Mr. Dai is from Sichuan, and his dishes are excellent. That day, I originally wanted to eat a big meal with him, but after tasting the Shaoxing wine, it was extremely fragrant, so I drank it as much as possible. This kind of fine wine can only be obtained in the homes of good friends. Recently, I took a small trip to West Lake with my friends. I went on June 5th and returned on the 10th (the day before the Dragon Boat Festival). I drank three times at the Zhu Hengsheng Hotel. Although I can't call it good wine, it was indeed brewed in Shanyin, which is not easy to get in Shanghai. I don't even know that there is a wine shop called "Chunhao" in Yanjing mentioned by Mr. Zhang. I will definitely try it when I go to the lake in the future.</p>
<p>I have heard of Mr. Yan Qiao's name for a long time, and his writings are often read in the newspaper, but I have no chance to meet him. He said in "Wine Talk": "You must find a companion to drink with. As the saying goes, 'Wine meets bosom friends, a thousand cups are too few.' This is indeed true." I very much agree with this. Among all my wine friends in Shanghai, only Xu Boqiu understands the fun of wine. Mr. Xu is from Hangzhou, and is good at playing the flute, and is known as the "King of Flutes." When I drink with Boqiu, I often feel that there are too few wine companions. However, this matter is flavorful when it is unintentional and natural, but it is boring when it is a formal dinner party. I ask Mr. Yan Qiao about this, I wonder what he thinks?</p>
<h3>Climate Prediction</h3>
<p>— Shan Shi</p>
<p>"When it is evening, ye say, It will be fair weather: for the sky is red. And in the morning, It will be foul weather to day: for the sky is red and lowring." Although this is a passage from the Bible, it has a fairly accurate scientific basis. The English Observation Magazine lists the following so-called old wives' experiences, which are quite interesting:</p>
<p>If your hair is softer than usual, it is a sign that it will rain; because hair stays hard in high air pressure (sunny and dry weather).</p>
<p>Old injuries, such as tooth decay and swollen feet, become aggravated when it will rain because of low air pressure.</p>
<p>The weather is likely to rain without dew, because the non-production of dew is caused by a lack of cloud central nuclear particles to condense it.</p>
<p>If there is a blurry halo around the moon, it will rain in four hours, because moon halos are formed by refraction of ice or water vapor in the air.</p>
<p>Yellow evening glow foretells rain the next day, because the setting sun passes through humid air; red glow foretells clear sky the next day, because the sun's rays pass through dry air particles.</p>
<p>If the smoke coming out of the chimney has a downward trend, it foretells rain, because the smoke does not easily rise in low-pressure wet winds.</p>
<p>In clear weather, birds fly high because their wings are drier and they fly very high. If it will rain, swallows fly low because low air pressure disturbs their sensitive hearing.</p>
<p>Seagulls stop to rest as a warning of an approaching storm, because birds are easily tired in the thin air of low pressure.</p>
<p>If cumulus clouds gradually become black and low at noon, it may rain at dusk; only a few cumulus clouds in the high sky foretell several days of sunny weather.</p>
<h3>Eastern Scales and Western Claws</h3>
<p>— Cang Yu</p>
<p>The Bridgeton Liars' Club in the United States nominates a world liar of the year. The 1947 title was won by J. Hoppley of San Antonio. His story is that when he was playing bocce ball, a fly flew over and landed on the eighth ball. He flicked it, and the eighth ball flew away in response, but the ball went so fast that the fly lost its footing and fell on the table, breaking its spine.</p>
<p>The strangest hotel in the world is located in a forest ten miles outside of Kanya City, a British colony in Africa. The hotel is built on a large tree, forty feet above the ground. Guests at the Tree Tops Hotel can safely see various jungle beasts coming to drink water in the pond in front of the hotel in the morning and evening. The hotel room rate is $50 per day. Guests are transported to and from Kenya by armed guards at no extra charge.</p>
<h3>In Praise of Monks</h3>
<p>— Gongsun Wu</p>
<p>After Wang Anshi resigned as prime minister, he wrote a commentary on the Shurangama Sutra, elaborating on the omissions of other teachers and omitting the details of other teachers. There were places where he expressed his unique knowledge, but unfortunately his book was not passed down. Wang was a great politician, and his courage was extraordinary. He may have gained something from Buddhism. In his collection of poems imitating Hanshan and Shide, he wrote, "Courage comes from Meng Shishe, who has no fear. If people learn Buddhism, courage should be like this." Chen Yi also praised the Buddha for his courage. Their views were the same, but the world believes that Buddhist learners must be "passive." If Wang's reforms were not so-called actively taking. Zeng Gong was also a critic of Buddhism. In a letter to Wang, he said that Buddhist scriptures disrupt customs. Wang replied, "The disruption of customs today does not lie in Buddhism, but in the fact that scholars and officials are immersed in profit and desire, and value each other's words, but do not know how to govern themselves." His praise of monks was that "they are mostly tolerant and not jealous, simple and quiet, and have no desires. When scholars boast and steal, those who have ended and have nothing are more numerous in the world, so they are detached and aloof." He also praised two monks, saying, "They have both used their knowledge to free themselves from the filth of the world, and they all have the talent of intelligence and wisdom." Those who learn Buddhism are intelligent, wise, not jealous, and not acquisitive, while those who boast and steal are regarded as passive, which is indeed their intention. However, his words are not exhaustive. Are Buddhist disciples merely detached and aloof?</p>
<p>###</p>
<p>The imperial examinations of the past were deeply rooted in history and held significant importance for politics and society, each with its own advantages and disadvantages.</p>
<p>Its social significance lay in breaking down class barriers, allowing the masses opportunities for development, fairness, and equality. It aimed to even out wealth and status, as everyone depended on it. For example, wealthy merchants and large landowners enjoyed favorable treatment in ordinary times, and their wealth could influence many. However, once involved in litigation or assigned public service, government officials could exert pressure, and runners and servants could extort and harass them, even leading to ruin. But if they could hire a teacher for their children and diligently study the classics to pass the examination, obtaining just one "Xiucai" degree meant "entering the official's gate." The perception and treatment of this person and their family by political, business, agricultural, and literary circles would undergo a significant shift. (If a Xiucai was treated this way, the situation for Juren and Jinshi degree holders was even more evident. As for buying an official title with money, while it could maintain appearances, it did not command genuine respect from all sides.)</p>
<p>From another perspective, a poor child, as long as they could study diligently and become literate, could enter the "official's gate." Some wealthy farmers and merchants would eagerly seek to marry their daughters to him or recruit him into their family, because if the family lacked scholarly offspring, having a Xiucai as a son-in-law would bring glory to the family. They might even share assets and provide support for the provincial and metropolitan examinations, hoping for further advancement and to have him tutor their own sons. Thus, this poor child, through success in the imperial examination, not only gained fame but also wealth. Hence the saying, "In books, there are faces of jade; in books, there are houses of gold." As long as one studies, one need not worry about living a life of luxury. This is the wonderful use of "poor people turning over" and leveling wealth.</p>
<p>Now, let me give a concrete example, such as Mr. Lu Runxiang Fengshi, the last famous Suzhou Zhuangyuan and Prime Minister of the Qing Dynasty. His father's name was Song, and he served as an instructor at the Zhenjiang Prefectural School, a so-called "bean curd official," implying a humble position. Zhenjiang was formerly known as "Runzhou," and there was a "Phoenix Stone Scenic Spot" in the Prefectural School. Mr. Lu was born in his grandfather's official residence, hence the name "Runxiang" and the style name "Fengshi." ("Xiang" refers to schools.) In his youth, he studied diligently with his father, and in the Guiyou year of the twelfth year of Tongzhi of the Qing Dynasty, he passed the Juren examination. The following year, in the Jiaxu year, he achieved the top rank in the Jinshi examination and was awarded the position of Compiler. In the Bingzi year (the second year of Guangxu, only one year after the Jiaxu year), he served as a co-examiner for the metropolitan examination in the spring. In the autumn, he was appointed chief examiner of Hunan Province. As an imperial envoy, he was provided with accommodations and transportation by local officials all the way to the province. Upon arrival, cannons were fired and a temporary residence was built, with all the ceremonial honors and etiquette equal to that of the governor. Recalling that just three years earlier, he was merely an ordinary scholar, it was truly a meteoric rise, placing him among the elite!</p>
<p>In dramas, such as "Yu Tang Chun," Wang Jinlong, a down-on-his-luck scholar, became an imperial inspector because he topped the imperial examination. According to the Ming system, there were two high officials and three departments in a province. The two high officials were the governor, in charge of all administrative and livelihood matters, and the imperial inspector, responsible for investigating and impeaching derelict officials, receiving complaints everywhere, and hearing grievances. Such was the Wang Inspector in the play. Typically, the imperial inspector was an official from the Imperial Censorate. In the Ming Dynasty, censors were only seventh-rank officials (elevated to fifth-rank in the early Qing Dynasty), but as an imperial envoy, he was an "inspector." Therefore, the financial and judicial commissioners, although second or third-rank senior officials (the red-robed and blue-robed officials in the play), would bow and pay respects when they met him, and sit on both sides of the hall (the third department was the Regional Military Commission, which was not seated because it was in charge of military affairs). Wang Jinlong, as a down-on-his-luck youth, attained a high position and enjoyed honor. Although it is a play, it realistically portrays the transformative power of the imperial examination, breaking down class barriers and distinctions between rich and poor, noble and lowly. (Whether Wang and Su were real people and whether the cases were the same is a matter for scholars to research and another question.)</p>
<p>In old novels and plays, many stories warn against wealthy and powerful families who "despise the poor and love the rich," often regretting it when their poor son-in-law achieves high rank in the imperial examination. Such stories abound. Hence, there is a saying: "This year's Xiucai, next year's 'ba he' (eight measures of rice)."</p>
<p>To say that everyone should be rich and noble, or that everyone should toil and suffer, is equality is merely an ideal. But equal opportunity is equality.</p>
