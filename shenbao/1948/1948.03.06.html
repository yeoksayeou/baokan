<h3 id="c1">遼西戰局順利發展　遼南匪越遼河北竄集結　四平機塲被襲立經擊退 <a href="#c1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>〔本報瀋陽五日電〕四平雖緊張，但除四平西五公里飛機塲曾於三日晚被匪　度攻襲，經國軍擊退外，尙無大接觸。又瀋束本溪方面匪未作正面攻襲。</p>
<p>〔本報瀋陽五日電〕遼南匪大部越遼河北上，刻遼南僅有匪第四縱隊等部在本溪營口間，第九縱隊則在新民以南地區，其餘之第一，二，三，，六，七，八等縱隊，均已到達遼北。匪之北上行動，除妄圖犯四平及吉長，並便整補外，或有其他政治性存在。另傳哈爾濱由伯力到有蘇軍事顧問百餘人。又傳林彪決編十五歲以上靑年若干師，在松北訓練，並冀早日佔有吉長，得爲新軍政重心。</p>
<p>〔中央社瀋陽五日電〕遼西戰局正在有利發展，國軍某精銳兵團刻以破竹之勢，向預定地區推進，新立屯一帶已無股匪盤據，其大部業於三日晚向法庫方面逃竄，我空軍四日出動頻繁，分向營口遼源及四平週境轟炸搽射，收穫甚豐。又四平方面有小接觸，殘匪千餘，於三日夜由八面城附近分向四平機塲以西及以北地）區竄犯，業經守軍擊退。</p>
<p>〔聯合社北平五日電〕據東北來電稱：國軍即將打通直達瀋陽之走廊，援軍沿平瀋路自寥北推進，現距新民僅數哩，一旦新民解圍，自華北至瀋陽之陸路交通，即可恢復，惟修理被毁鐵路，或需數星期之久。前在瀋楡段鐵路活動之共匪，已撤至瀋陽北面，殆因損失過重，並爲避免遼河解　後，陷入重圍，由此可見共軍並無充分實力奪取瀋陽，仍保持避免大規模正面作戰之一貫政策。</p>
<p>〔本報瀋陽五日電〕某有資格人士分析東北戰局稱：近日匪主力北移而成萎縮狀態，顯係出關國軍之壓力，自政治上看，此乃舉國上下熱切注意東北之結果。東北戰塲需有全國支援，殆無疑義。目前瀋陽威脅雖吿解除，前途仍甚艱險，此時匪之七次攻勢可謂吿一段落，其損失亦極慘重，現時之萎縮爲整補階段，尙難斷言爲强弩之末，其次一行動殊堪重視。東北共匪成長之迅速，有內在及外在因素，其補給之充裕，尤爲不可忽視之事實。東北戰局雖漸趨明朗，陰影並未消滅，共匪萎縮或爲緩兵之計，國人警覺之視綫不可分散。</p>

<p>〔本報南京五日電〕東北幣制改革問題，經東北　宿及請願團與財部商洽結果，財部原則上已同意改革，惟技術問題尙須與央行商洽，錢幣司長戴銘禮已於五日夜車赴滬，將與張嘉璈會商東北幣制改革之技術問題，財部希望此問題　於下週內商獲解決辦法。</p>

<p>〔本報南京五日電〕東北　宿張作相，馬占山，萬福麟，於五日夜車自京赴滬，莫德惠特伴送至滬。張等在滬略作停留後即返平。行前馬。張接見記者，答覆若千詢問，張等首先表示，此行之成就，一爲將主席之昭示，即中央在任何情况下，決不放棄東北，中失已有決心，有辦法；一爲組織地方武力問題，渠等俟返北方後，聽候命令，再行組織，中央並無具體計劃。記者曾詢以與司徒大使會見時是否特別以東北問題提請司使轉美政府，請求援助？據答：尙未，惟司使對此極表關切。强等旋表示，尙有若十未解決之問題，將由東北請願團與各方續作商洽。渠等除對救國救鄉之途徑尋求效力機會外，餘無所求，渠等亦無個人之希望。（張作相等書面談話，在京東北圑體及京市參會歡迎張氏等消息刊二版）</p>

<p>〔本報南京五日電〕東北請願團王化一等，連日在京向各方奔走呼籲，派援軍，運軍糧，改革幣制，組織地方武力四端，前兩者已獲得相當圓滿之成果，增援部份，主席巳面允調撥大兵增援，並巳覓　實施。軍糧部份，經糧部之答覆，至本年四月底止，應　九十六萬大包糧食，現均已撥運竣事，今後按月撥運十二萬大包，決　延誤，是　軍新問題已全部　決。至民食部份，糧部亦另　籌劃。其次關於流通劵部份，五日午王副院長　五於宴請請願圑代表席上，已允即召國行總載張嘉　來京會商，改制問題。致亦可獲得相當解決。至組織地方武力，則尚待中央指示。請願圑等一行決定請願不獲成果不向東北，故將續作奔走。同時渠等與司徒大便亦將繼續作持接觸。王化一於五日午後三時許再訪司使，有所晤談。</p>

<p>〔中央社長春五日電〕吉主席梁華盛，今　於記者招待會席上，再度宣　其　吉長地區之決心與自信。渠謂：鞏固吉長防務，須分積極的與消極的兩項辦法，一齊下手，前　爲擴充增强地方武力，至擴充武力之詳細步驟，一則拒絕發表，後者爲培養者長地區之更生力量。梁氏謂　現已擬就「自力生產運動」之草案，待與各方研妥後，即於吉長兩地全面展開，該運動內容將包括「綠化」，「勞作」，及「增產」諸項。</p>

<p>〔本報南京五日電〕卅七年度我國進出口貿易計劃，經經濟部詳細研商後，已擬訂原則及政策，其詳細實施辦法，現正在研究補充，一俟擬定，即呈請政院核示。據悉：新計劃對現行結匯辦法，已提出部份修正，主張另實行新結匯辦法。新計劃主要部份，約可分爲外匯及貿易管理兩大部門，其要點如下：</p>
<p>（甲）外匯部份：（一）實行新結匯辦法，過去出口物資全部向央行結匯，薪計劃中主張凡對國際市塲看利者，如豬鬃，桐油，茶葉等出口物資，最多向央行結匯三分之一。依據該計劃中估計，去年出口總領約為一偉美元，如實行新結　辦法，今年出口可達二億至三億美元，向央行結匯者如以三分之一計算，政府每年約可得九千萬美元，加以國營事業機構之出口估計，亦可得九千萬一美元，本年度政府可掌握出口部分外認一億八千萬美元。（二）外匯匯準調整之原則，應顧及出口物一資之上漲率及法幣在國外購買力之平價，如依上述原則調整，黑市即可消滅，僑匯亦可增加。據估計：今年約可達一億二千萬美元，與出口部份外匯一億八千萬美元合計，政府約可掌握三億美元充建設之用。（三）出口商所得出口外匯，除向央行結匯者外，其餘必須用於進口，其方式不加肯定，可自行進口或售與進口商，但必須於半年內辦理完竣，而由政府負責監督之，政府對出口所得外匯，應　爲登記，以備考核。（四）政府對於進口外匯，不予供給，進口商人所需之外匯，可由出口商所得外匯，僑匯，外人投資及國人在外之資產存款等途徑取得。</p>
<p>（乙）貿易管理部份：（一）出口採自由貿易政策，政府不加干涉，（二）進口採管制政策，規定凡奢侈品等禁止入口，爲保護國內工業計，對某種物品可限制進口，限制進口之物品視情形臨時規定，凡機器。原料及建築器材等，可以自由進口。（三）取消許可證辦法，簡化進出口手續。</p>

<h3 id="c30">反對史特萊克的不賠償計劃 <a href="#c30" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e30" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">30</a></h3>
<p>美國「國外事務諮詢協會」，於本月一日，發表一百七十五員的報告書，向陸軍部建藏，不應將日本非純粹的戰爭工業移去作充賠償。這個報吿書的起草人，就是主張反賠償論的史特萊克氏，所以這次一史特萊克報吿書的提出，可說是美國反賠償計劃的提出。中，菲，加三國，受日本侵略威脅最深期望日本賠價最切，對於這個反賠償計　的提出，自然也最注意。現在遠東十國當局，對美國的「試探氣球」，尙無明確的表示，大約要保留至遠東委員會開會時，始能正式表示態度。但據合衆社的報道，在遠東十一國內，祇少有四五國將表示反對，除中國和菲律賓而外，紐西蘭，澳洲聯邦以及印度，亦將表示異議。祗有戰敗國的日本，於一史特萊克報吿書一公佈後，報以歡悅，她們感謝史特萊克的網開一面，幷盼望這個計劃早日成立，使日本獲得一次戰敗的勝利。</p>
<p>按史特萊克氏是美國麥克格勞公司董事長，同時也是陸軍部賠償問題顧問。當鮑萊計劃經遠東委員會通過後，睦軍部同麥帥總部，認爲鮑萊計劃向日索賠額太「嚴格」了，陸軍部便命史特萊克赴日，担任賠償特別委員會主席，代表睦軍調查日本情况，準備車擬「寬大」的賠償計劃。去年一月，史氏起草建議一種，據設僅及鮑萊的百分之三十，細目始終未公佈。麥克阿瑟元帥認爲鮑萊計劃與史特萊克計劃，均碍難實行，乃由盟總另草一計劃，送睦軍部參考。麥帥計劃又完全忽視賠償在政治上的意義。陸軍部爲折衷上述各計劃，重新確定向日索賠　，復命史特萊克担負起草一種「寬大」的計劃。去年七月，史氏以「國外事務諮詢協會」主持人的地位，帶領了調憲　的技術專家，到東京研究日本問題，幷一度來　搜　參考材科，於十二月完成實地調查返國。史氏於赴日調查前，　爲一　美利加雜誌」撰述「報復即浪費」一文，主張推翻鮑萊的賠償計劃，打消遠東委員會一九四六年五月的通過案，而電新確立日本比較高的工業水準，讓她能在世界站立起來，依這個高度水準，日本不應賠償，好呌美國减少負累，其結論有云：「美國必須立　設法，取消遠東委員會的建議，困爲它不能使。本達於自給」。基於這個反賠償的謬論和他在日本調查的結果，去年九月間，本報會發表社論，加以駁斥。但史氏依舊我行我素，乃又於本月一日，公佈了這個新的計劃。力主保留日本工業，而認爲除了基本戰爭工業設備以外，一切日本工業設備的移去，均足以妨害世界生產，並减少日本達於自給自足的可能性。</p>
<p>「史特萊克報吿書」尙未提出遠東委員會而公佈，顯然是美國的「官方試探」，藉以明瞭遠東其他十國的意見，但我們認爲「史特萊克報吿書」不是一種「賠償計劃」，而是一種政治性的扶植日本復興的計劃，如果讓這計劃發展，不僅的本戰時經濟立刻恢復起來，幷且遠東委員會決議和波茨坦宣言的條款，立刻會變成廢紙，無論任何情况，我們都要表示反對的。現在我們更申述反對的理由：</p>
<p>第一，我們　　　茨坦宣言必須獲得賠償，依國際公法和先例，賠償是戰幾國的議務，戰勝國索賠，是一種權利。我們中國受日太侵略最久，公私財產物資，多被摧毁，多被拆遷，我們必須獲得賠償和歸還·我們盼望對日和會早日召集，就是爲了要取得賠價；以迅速發展中國的工業。同時在另一方面，藉此以防止日本侵略勢力的再起。質言之，中國能否獲得日本賠償，是攸關中國百年會運的大問題。我們　對不賠償，反對日本高度的工業水準，並　對「日本工業中國農業」的陰謀。渡茨坦宣言明白規定：「允許日本維持其經濟所必需及可以償付貨物賠償之工業，但可以使其　新武裝作戰之工業，不在其內」。換言之，凡不是維持日本人民生活所必需，及可償付貨物賠償的工業，尤其是軍需工業，均應拆充賠償。「史特萊克報告書」建議保留日本銑鐵·鋼板·鋼條·硫酸·商船等物資約三分之二，約以三分之一作賠償，對紡織工業及其他重工業機器工具槪予保留，顯然完全保留了日本的軍需工業，並不拆除戰爭的工業設備，這是違反波茨坦宣言精神。</p>
<p>第一，我們要提出自己的主張，要求遠東各國贊同我國與論一致認爲日本復興，勢必威脅中國的安全。史特萊克的計劃，顯在促進日本的加速復　，所以政府當局對此，也十分重視。並已將限制日本工業水準表加以修正，據行政院政務會議的決定：凡航空及軍事工業，應完全摧毁，鐵道及重工業，則逐漸减少；此在紡織工業，减至相當數量。爲防制日本的再起從事侵略，我國政府決定的尺度，旣屬必要；且為合理；自應向遠東委員會，據理力爭，不達目的不止。好在史特萊克的計劃，尙未經遠東委員會通過，此際我國在外交上着能運用得宜　國的主張必能為遠東委員會所採納。</p>
<p>第三，我們　　　遠東委員會的決　一一九四五年十月公佈的美國對日一般初步計劃，日本應有行賭償和歸還劫奪品的義務。一九四六年四”代表美總統的賠償專員鮑萊氏，建議把日本平時工業能力削减百分之三十，其目的在使日本不能够發動另一次戰爭，並使日本人明瞭她們是戰敗國，應該受到一種懲罰。鮑萊計劃經一九四六年五月遠東委員會通過，美國也表示同意。一年以來，遠東委員會設法實施這計劃，並指定一千一百所工廠拆充賠償中菲等國。一九四七年六月二十日，遠東委員會公佈對日基本政策，以爲未來訂立日本和約之根據與原則，對於日本工業水準與賠償，更規定了明確的觀念。我們中國爲遠東委員會重要委員國之一，自應尊重遠東委員會的組議和決議。鮑萊計劃內容，在美國軍部看來固然是太「嚴格」，然據我們研究，確有「　大」之嫌，我們爲　重遠東委員會決議精神，並未否決鮑萊計劃的通過。美國陸軍部對鮑萊計劃，信心顯已動搖，另　『史特萊克報吿書』不僅要推辭鮑萊計劃，幷且還要改變原來見解，打消遠東委員會一切決議，甚至不惜放棄波茨坦決定的懲罰立場，而採取績極扶植日本復興的立塲，置未來的對日和會於不顧，無論如何，我們是不能同意</p>
<p>總之，「史特萊克報吿書」的反賠償論，並欲反對遠東委員會所通過的一切決議完全是不合理的。我們希望賢明的美國政府當局能考慮到「史特萊克反賠償論」的爆炸性，當機立斷，立即保持原來的見解。同時並盼望美國當局迅速打破日本和會的僵局，使日本賠償問題和工業水準問題，早日獲得合理的解　！</p>

<p>〔美國新聞處華盛頓四日電〕戰時曾任駐華美軍總司令之魏德邁中將，四日告衆院外交委員會答稱，渠建議在五億七千萬美元之經濟援華計劃中，應列入軍事援助一項。　魏氏特別說明，所謂軍事援助，並非在軍事上參與反抗中共軍隊之謂。渠提　在使用所供給之武器方面，應予以適當之拔術指導。</p>
<p>魏德　　認在　國政策上，憑對馬歇爾之意見，待有誠實之異議，雖然，對國務卿之忠誠，總　及能力，表示最高之敬意。渠稱：「除非吾人以車享援助保　吾人所作之協助，否則余認　吾人不在文化，經　及政治戰爭上帮助共他國家。」</p>
<p>魏德　　答　一　問題時稱：「余相信，對於信服吾人生活方式而願意保持自由之世界各民族，吾人應給予軍事援助。余相信吾人應以軍事援助給予中國。」</p>
<p>有人詢以是否更宜於在目前擴展經濟援助，而在中國獲得自助機會以後並有必需時，再擴展軍事援助？魏德邁答稱：「如在兩年前，余將認為閣下之主張甚為完善，惟時至今日，余認爲已屬鍋晚。」</p>
<p>魏德邁將軍稱，共產黨軍隊自北方衝入東北及　國本部，具有如此之速率與力量，以致「僅持金錢」，已不能在該地或任何地區予以阻止。渠並抨　認爲　國共產黨僅屬農民而欲求逃　專制之國　政府壓迫之錯誤觀　。渠確信中國共產黨係爲國際共產主義　努力。</p>
<p>魏氏向外委會解釋稱，由於渠就中國及朝鮮情形向總壳所　報告之機密性質，渠覺　席作證略有困難。渠稱，由於安全之種種原因，渠在答　問題時亦須審愼從事，良以渠爲設計作戰處處長，對於此等問題可能有機密之消息故也。</p>
<p>當詢以渠認爲對美國之成脅當以中國方面　以歐洲方面爲甚者，魏氏請委員會原諒，恕不能加以答　，因其他方面人士對於此一問題之答覆將具興趣之故。　外委會同意魏氏之要求，決定舉行行政會議，倪使魏氏能作更充份之答覆。惟在獲准暫不作答之節，魏氏曾對蔣主席之人格以及中國政府在改革方面所獲之進步，備致崇揚。</p>
<p>魏德邁盛贊蔣主席稱：「余深知蔣主席之爲人。端納（前主席之政治顧問）或許知之更諗，但端納已逝世。余曾與主席同處二年，余對渠有最高之尊敬與欽佩。渠爲一絕對誠實與正直之人。」</p>
<p>魏德邁否認在上次大戰時期內，大批美國軍用物資曾有被國民政府腐敗領袖移作別用之事。渠稱，當渠在中國巡行之時，所有飛越印度而來之美國物資，幾全數抵　國軍手中。</p>
<p>有一委員詢問渠是否信任中國之諾言，　　　稱，渠確知蔣主席之絕對正直與　實，在渠與主席後此往來中，渠從未遇到「東方之機　」。</p>
<p>渠　信中國人能履行其一切協定。渠並稱，中國政府現正企圖向美國所願望之　前進，並　新共行政。</p>
<p>魏德邁續稱：「久居中國之外人曾吿稱，彼等對於蔣主席所完成之進步，基表驚異。」但魏德邁對於中國政府是否能戰勝共黨一事；表示懷疑。或問協助中國戰勝共黨，將需要何種行動，魏德邁躊躇片時，然後答稱，渠對此不能提供一「聽敏之答覆」，謂此事應由國務院指導。</p>
<p>渠解釋：「自余上次在中國以來，中國局勢之惡化，甚爲迅速，致余目下無法作答。必須重新調查，方能確定需要多少援助。」</p>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓四日電〕魏德邁在衆院外委會陳述援華法案意見時，讚頌蔣主席稱：「昔余就任中國戰區美軍司令之便，本不擬信任蔣主席，但　職時，對之已甚為欽佩；蔣氏關心人民而不自大，願意犧牲一己。日本一度似將戰勝中國，余要求蔣主席　新部　　隊，蔣兵毫不猶豫，即予接受，局勢　得挽回。」又共和黨衆議員周以德曾向魏氏稱：「據余所知，馬歇爾並未反對在軍事上援助中國，僅不頣將此稱援助列入國會目前討論之法案。」又衆院外委會予魏德邁發言完畢後，即舉行秘密會議。（按：魏氏證詞要點已見昨日第一版。）</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕倫敦五日廣播：白魯塞爾訊，會商西歐聯盟之五國會議，今日暫停開會，因英國第二代表傑勃與法國外交部秘書長卓凡爾在返國請示後，因爲北海濃霧所阻，朱能及時趕到之故。預料會議於星期日能獲致一般諒解。</p>
<p>〔中央社白魯塞爾四日合衆電〕英法荷比盧五國代表已於迫切之氣氛中，開始會議，以草搬長期經濟文化及軍事條約。此會議料將奠定基礎，使民主國家迅速成立西歐聯盟，並爲參加馬歇爾計劃之十六國家日後舉行之會議預闢坦途。此極端秘密會議係在比外部舉行，新聞記者不准入塲。唯爲時九十分鐘之會議究畢後，曾發表公報稱，五國意見極爲相近。英比人士謂，擬議之條約將包括軍事條款，規定對來自任何方向之侵略行動，採取一致行動，該條約將爲期五十年，官方稱之爲經濟社會文化條約。英外相稱，此條約乃奠定鞏固而亟需之組織之基礎。另悉，軍事條款中，將包括保證西歐一旦受襲，定加以軍事援助，各國政府曾否正式交換文件並無跡象。消息靈通人士謂，須待西歐聯盟確實成立後始能交換。</p>
<p>〔路透社白魯塞爾四日電〕接近五國代表團之人士稱，西歐聯盟公約可望迅速起草。四日在比京開始之五强初步會談，至本週六或至遲星期日即可結束。五國外長在討論馬歇爾方案之歐洲十六國會議於三月十五日在巴黎開會以前，即可舉行會議，結束西歐聯盟公約之起草而完成簽字手續。另據可靠方面息，比京之初步會議已不擬討論西歐聯盟五國公約之軍事問題，此點當俟英帝國參謀總長蒙哥馬利元帥於本月底赴比視察比國軍事設備時，提出討論。另悉，英法兩國代表於五日之會議中，將提出最近經英法交換意見後而產生的西歐聯盟新建議，供荷比盧三國硏究。荷比盧三國所擬之公約草案，據云，巳獲得各代表之普遍協議。荷比盧三國主張締結五國間密切的區域協定。聯合國憲章固已有區域協定之規定，此五國公約應包含互助的規定及簽字國間各項可能歧見的和平解決」。</p>

<p>〔路透社倫敦四日電〕此間觀察家相信，西歐五國公約之早日簽字，可證華盛頓之業已表示準備以必要的軍事後盾，支持西歐聯盟。大部份人士均信，美國與英法荷比盧五國業巳成立關於西歐聯盟安全部份的諒解。就美副國務卿洛維特昨日之聲明觀，可證此項揣測之不悮。</p>
<p>洛氏曾曰，由美國保證以抗對馬歇爾方案諸國的侵略，或可代替美國前所建議的四强防德侵略四十年公約。洛氏雖亦表示在西歐聯盟已有若干形式存在時，美國之保證將不能實現，然美國之將鼓勵早日成立此一聯盟，殆已毫無疑義。頃悉西歐十六國中除英法外，至少尙有義荷土及北歐三國將派外長赴巴黎，與英法討論擴大西歐聯盟之可能性。英國參加西歡聯盟之軍事責任，對於英共和邦其他國家亦有直接興趣。此間預料英國若接受西歐聯盟下的軍事義務，英共和邦其他國家或僅願與西歐職盟成立適當的軍事聯繫，而不擬直接接受正式的軍事義務。</p>

<p>— 本報編譯室</p>
<p>祈求持久的和平降臨人間</p>
<p>在我七十五年的生活中，我曾看到這一個國家從一個大陸的强國，生長成一個世界的强國，對地球上每一個角落，都有利害關係。</p>
<p>我們今日在武力上有力量，在和平與人道的宇義上也有力量。但我們有了龐大的實力，同時就有一種重大的責任。其中最重大的責任，是我們領導各國爲和平，正義，自由與進步而走向合作之路。</p>
<p>過去有一種普遍的觀念，並獲得傳統的支持，以爲美國無所畏懼，前途確有把握，我們龐大的資源和組織的能力，保證我們的命運，我們的制度將持久不衰。這種信念再沒有更危險的了。</p>
<p>事實上，我們已到了一個我們應當站定，觀看和傾聽的時期。我們應當以銳利自省，來分析我們自己和我們在世界上的地位。</p>
<p>這一世代的人民是否眞的比他們以前幾世代的前人境况好些？科學和發明已使他們有更多享受的東西，在這一點上，他們的確比從前的人好得多。他們有各種好的東西吃，和好的東西穿，並有好的娛樂，和從前有限的生活享受比較起來，果然幸福得多了。可是在其他若干方面，情形就差了。他們缺乏廣泛的敎育，缺乏對自由和法治精神的熱誠，並對於公共事務的進行，不能保持深切的興趣和警覺。</p>
<p>據我的意見看來，有組織的社會在過去一世代內已經衰落了。</p>
<p>我們已看到國際整個政治組織的顯著的衰落，同時國際整個經濟組織有摧毁的威脅。在政治和經濟事務中，人類已受到一種逐漸的衰退，我們高唱科學和發明的進步來對每一個人催眠，這是沒有效用的。除非我們本國的公民和其他各國的公民對公共事務如同他們對私事一樣關心和注意，否則我們對付自己國內的事務和世界的和平問題，結果必然完全失敗，而世界和平問題將田於原子彈的發明而更加嚴重。　民主主義不是一個靜止的機構，像一座敎堂或一座摩天大樓那樣。民主一經確立，不能期望它一代又一代的獨立下去。民主是一種活的　機體，所以必須加以看護，培養和引導。</p>
<p>我們不能以過去的成就和現在的財產認爲滿足。我們今日所有的一切自由，都是由於抵抗國內或國外的暴政而得到的，其中大半是用血和鐵換來的。</p>
<p>自由的到臨，經過那些願爲自由而捨命的男女的努力。我們是他們的承繼人，所以我們必須留心保守我們的遺產。</p>
<p>讓我們選擇那些一却道人民的需要的人，來做我們的領袖。我們的領袖中有幾位，像傑弗遜那樣，是爲了促進民主主義和給予人民以利益而進身仕途的。傑弗遜無意於權勢，更無意於地位或示惠於人，他甚至企圖使馬迪遜來代替他自己做總統的候選人。我們今日當然也有賦有同樣崇高精神的人物　我們亟需要更多的宗敎和道德，作爲政府的背景。這裏如同世界各處一樣，也需要加强思想和行爲的宗敎道德基礎。再沒有比宗敎和道德觀念更高的文明勢力。只有在這些觀念予人以認識腐敗和暴政的能力並予入以消滅它們的力量的時候，這種腐敗和暴政方能從政府中驅除出去。</p>
<p>美國各州應時刻留心保護它們公民的公權。一切公民自由投票的權利應加以保護，而他們前往投票匭的道路，不應受到阻碍。</p>
<p>我相信國會和行政當局必須在政府中遵守嚴格的經濟節省，而各州各郡和各市，也須潸樣做去。在這個現代世界上，大多數官吏和個人，對於公衆或私人的經濟，往往不大顧到</p>
<p>讓我們在情形許可之下，儘量依附個人創造力和自由企業的古老政策。政府須扮演一個監督和檢査的重要角色，保證自由企業的眞正自由和公平，全體人民都受到保護，但政府切不可殺害我們民族所以成爲偉大的精神。　國會和行政當局有一個不可規避的責任，使我們的外交政策保持在一個非政黨的基礎上　。當我在國務院裏的時期內，我對於任何一個問題的工作，從未有如對這一個問題的工作那樣辛勤。</p>
<p>我繼續相信：參院同意一切條約的核准需要三分之二的表決一點，應由憲法的修正案改爲：祗要多數表決即予通過。美國的人民，國會和行政當局必須密切注意，以免美國再回到危險的孤立政策。在一世代以內的兩次大戰，應使一切美國人覺悟：我們是世界的一個重要部份，海外的衝突必然影響到我們，而我們的福利和平及安全，與其他各國都有連帶關係。我們有一種欲罷不能的領導和合作的責任。」</p>
<p>過去，直至一九三四年爲止，我們對世界量顯明的不盡職，恐怕要算我們的經濟孤立主義。高我率並不把繁榮帶給我們。它們帶給我們的是國內賣不掉的剩餘物資，和海外其他各國的憤懣。</p>
<p>華盛頓總統曾發言反對與其他國家訂立永久的同盟，雖然他默許暫時的同盟。但是現在這聯合國的性質是一種反侵略的同盟。我們不必對這種同盟表示震驚。這不是一種反對其他國家集團的同盟，而是一種反對任何侵略的同盟。這不是一種戰爭的同盟，而是一種和平的同盟。</p>
<p>聯合國機構包括一切愛好和平的國家，它的成立，據我的意見看來，是世界政治發展的一個轉捩點。</p>
<p>但是我們勿以為聯合國能够表演一個奇蹟。聯合國的憲章是一禮人造的工具，不是一個十全十美的工具·欲使這個機構的工作有效，需要時間，忍耐，和各國的合作精神。</p>
<p>尤其重要的是，這個機構需要蘇，英，中，法，美五大國的繼　合作。惟有這五國之間的共同友好合作，才能產生維持和平所必需的諒解與一致行動。</p>
<p>聯合國應得而且必須有美國人民木動搖的支持。我們不要因爲這新機構的各理事會中發表衝突的意見而就感到灰心。我們不要一方面認爲聯合國無法工作，所以我們必須恢復國家主義和孤立，而在另一方面認爲聯合國不適當，所以我們必須以世界政府來取而代之。</p>
<p>我們應當力圖捉進普遍裁减軍備的計劃，由聯合國在各國實施監察，確保這個計劃的執行。經濟和軍事的武裝的瘋狂競爭，是一種對文明的控訴。主張加重軍備的人，正在玩弄數千萬男子，婦女與兒童的生命財產。但裁减軍備必須是比較性的，我們切不可再讓美國减退到軍事上束手無策的地步。在我們解釋我們的外交政策時候，其他各國必須仍能看到我們實力的徵象。　美國人對於發表關於別國的意見，必需實行節制。我們這個民族，慣於指摘別的國家和統治者，輕用形容詞，諷刺，和議笑。我們忘了我們這種尖刻的字句，並不就此埋沒在報紙的新聞欄中，或失落在座談會或無綫電廣播中。這些字句給被咒詛的政府和人民知道了，會使這些國家的報紙和無綫電加以複印和批評，因爲這些國家也許不明白我們的批評自由，而且這些字句妨礙我們的外交關係·在查駡別人之前，</p>
<p>一個人應從一數到十，對於這　一條舊規則，我願加上一條新規則：就是在責駡別的國家之前，我們應當數上十小時或十天，同時我們對於似乎値得譴責的事件，應當確定其全部事實的眞相。</p>
<p>我要請美國少數集團特別注，意這一條規則，不論這些集團是屬於種族的，國家的，或宗敎的。憲法的宗旨是保護一切人民，尤其是少數份子。但是近年來這些集團中有一都份，利用報導和宣傳方法的進步，對於外交事務，已提出一種與他們人數不相稱的呼聲和壓力　。這些千涉外交的少數份子大半是左翼份子或反動的極端份子，也有些最近移民到美國來的人，他們是慢性的煽動者，他們所主張的意見，足以破壞我們政治和經濟的組織。有不少次數，當我們政府的國際關條需要最微妙和審慎處理的時候，這些集圑中有幾個在一致侵略性的公共輿論支持之下，散播毒素，或用其他方法破壞國際關係。</p>
<p>我們必須承認並甘願負起我們對以前的敵人德國和日本的義務。如果在未來的數十年內我們對他們非維持軍事或其他性質的監督不可，那末我們應當情願維持這種監督。我們不應抱有迅速由歐洲或亞洲撤退的思想。</p>
<p>在西半球，讓我們繼續在一切可能的方法之下發展和擴大睦隣政策。我們從這種政策中所得的結果證明欠應當再進一步培植這個種子。在我們患難的時候，我們在南方的朋友，祗有一個例外，其餘都證明是我們的眞正的朋友。</p>
<p>我們的國家和一切的國家，尤其包括上次對暴君勢力作殊死戰的各大盟國，如果不明瞭在不久的將來他們將面臨歷來量重大的危機，那末他們只是自　自而已。如果他們決心使和平，秩序和交明的勢力隨同統一和鞏固他們的政治和道德力量的任務一時不斷進行，那末他們將有很大的成力，足以保持世界的永久和平，自由和文明，必要時不妨用武力保持</p>
<p>一切國家必須不斷努力在絕對平等的基礎上共同合作，一方面不懷成見，另一方面不抱偏愛主義或綏靖能度。</p>
<p>關於國際合作的許多基本原則，每一個都是極其重要的，但一切國家和人民絕對不能逃避的一個最高的職責是維持和發展一種能永久維特和平的國際機構。這裏有一個近乎不易之理：凡是忠心履行聯合國機構會員資格的職　的國家，將得到平等而不可計數的利益，不履行這種職資的國家，將遭遇到愈來愈多的困難。為了全體的利益，各國應一起合作，使這個世界機構永久延續下去，並使其成爲眞正有效的機構　我們這個偉大的國家，對於各附屬的民族，在他們準備就緒的時候，應該始終成全他們的自治和獨立，依照我們在菲律濱所定的成例。但是我們在這方面的政策，不能僅以贊助爲限，而且也須包括積極的經濟援助，以提高這種民族的生活水準。</p>
<p>我們還要主張輿論在世界上有自由的發揮。今日全世界沒有自由的報紙或無綫電。恐怕有半數國家壓制或滲濾報導，或加以着色。在各國民族的思想能完全自由彼此交通以前，我們不能希望獲得使戰爭無從發生的眞正諒解。</p>
<p>我以如下的信念結束這些回憶錄：就是我們這個國家的命運仍在我們的前面，不是在我們的後面。如果我們願意隨時歇下來檢討過去，估量現在和準備未來，那末我相信成功的水平綫仍在我們的面前，像無盡的平原那樣延長下去。而最崇高的成功，莫如和其他各國和諧合作，直至戰爭的鞭子從我們的背上取去，而一個永久友善的和平降臨到我們身上。</p>

<h3 id="c76">參議大會昨日一致通過　不徵收哈同花園　估計須七千餘億政府無此力量　獻地建築圖書館等由府辦理 <a href="#c76" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e76" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">76</a></h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕市參議會於昨日下午繼續舉行第九次會議，對於哈同花園之徵收，天目路之拆屋問題，均有重要決議。哈同花園徽收爲公園一案，已予否決。天目路拆屋則決先組織委員會妥籌善後處理辦法後執行。</p>
<p>茲將大會討論提案之詳情誌后：關於哈同花園問題，共有有關提案三件：（一）市長交議轉交大衛喬治哈同函一件略謂：其個人分得哈同花園土地有五十餘畝，自願捐獻十五畝，並擬於慈善基金地產變賣後，提出十分之三，建築圖書館呈獻政府。但此意見未蒙參議會接受，而致哈同遺產至今全部凍結，且影響慈善事業之計劃。故希望市參會重行討論通渦捐默之提案以重產權而利公衆案（二）張中原等提請「利用捐獻土地，從速實行建築美術館」案。（三）張迺作於第四次大會臨時動議「爲貫澈本會第一第三兩次大會，議決征借南京西路愛　園改爲公園之精神，改爲征收該園爲本市永久之公園，以利市民而重衛生」案。此案於上次大會決議爲「保留」。故必須於此次大會中首先解決。</p>
<p>市長說明　兩種辦法</p>
<p>據吳市長說明：對於哈同花園政府祇能採取二種辦法，（一）接受捐獻，（二）完全征收。如決定征收亦無不可，但根據土地法政府必須在三年之內籌足經費，否則政府信用將喪失。至於以捐獻而言，喬治哈同在其本人分得名下捐獻十五畝，其他承繼人不肯捐獻。而喬治哈同並願提出慈善基金地產變賣後之十分之三作爲建圖書館之用，當時此數估計約有五十萬美金。現市府以其不願增加捐地，則要求增加經費，將十分之三增至十分之四，喬治哈同對此表示可以攷慮。據本人意見除接受其捐地及捐獻建造圖書館經費外，擬再徵收哈同花園其他土地十五畝，則又可建造美術館。</p>
<p>經費浩大　反對徵收</p>
<p>繼討論徽收問題，發言之參議員均表示反對徵收。姜屏藩不主張徵收之理由爲：經費問題，哈同花園之地價目前無法估計，若依義賣房屋地基而言，根據卅五年估定該區地價每畝應爲一千八百萬元，但業主不允，經市長再三商洽後定爲每畝十二億元，則較二年前漲六十六倍，而哈同花園地價至少每畝應値五十億元，以一五〇畝計須七千五百億一元。</p>
<p>政府以國庫空虛，對巳徵土地地價，猶未能償還，何况爲未徽收者？即退一步言，縱使有如此鉅款，亦應用之於解決民生或房荒等問題，不應用以開闢公園。至於捐獻問題，因此事對於市民旣有利而對國家亦無負擔，自不必交參議會討論，可以送回市長決定，或辦圖書館或辦美術館，通志館，悉由市政府辦理。</p>
<p>法律事實　均有困難</p>
<p>趙仰雄亦稱微收在事實上有困難。但張志韓意見，認爲哈同花園地價尙未估定，何來七千五百億元之價値？旣然如此，何以前次大會又不顧到此點，據加通過？行政院已批示可以徵收，自不必杞人憂天，可由政府去徽。言畢，議長當即聲明前次大會並未通過徽收，徵收案乃於第四次大會中始行提出，而決議爲「保留」，請張參議員注意。費樹聲·　鉞·姜懷素亦均謂徵收在法律及事實上均有困難，不同意徽收。</p>
<p>最後表決　無一贊成</p>
<p>陳存仁並報吿哈同花園內之園景並非如外界所想像，未必一開門即可關公園，內部燒去之地約有三十畝，假山坍塌，樹木被伐，如闢公園，需費浩大。姜豪贊成市長意見，一而接受捐獻，一面徵收十五畝。但經議長表示市府另擬徵收，祇可依法辦法，擬就辦法，另作議案　參會討論，不在本案範圍內。故最後付表決，贊成徵收者無一票（張志韓亦表示反對）張迺作提案即予否決。</p>
<p>至關於捐獻問題案，大會決議採納姜屏藩意見，交還市政府全權辦理，對於建造美術館，通志館或　書館，悉由市府統籌辦理。</p>
<h3 id="c77">大會通過熱烈擁戴　主席為首任大總統　議決電請美國實施全面援華　分別慰勉肅清積匪出力部隊 <a href="#c77" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e77" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">77</a></h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕前日參會議長，副議長等臨時動議「擬請大會一致擁戴國民政府主席蔣公爲首任大總統」案，經議長於昨日大會中提出後，全塲參議員一致熱烈鼓掌通過。潘議長並表示希望本市由區域·職業·婦女團體所膺選之國大代表能遵照本市民意機關之決議，在國民大會中一致選舉蔣主席爲大總統。</p>
<p>此外復通過臨時動議二案：（一）潘議長等提「爲淞滬警備司令部肅淸積匪，消弭亂萌，擬請大會決議，對該部及參加此役出力部隊分別予以慰勉」案，大會決議，本案通過，同時電請國防部轉前方將士慰勞。（二）議長，副議長等所提以上海市參議會名義，致電美國朝野，立即實施全面援華案，亦經大會通過。</p>
<h3 id="c78">天目路拆屋案　先籌善後立辦法 <a href="#c78" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e78" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">78</a></h3>
<p>關於天目路拆屋拓路一案，雖早於臨時參議會決議，後同居民一再講願，大會數度討論致未能完成。此次大會復有潘介眉等提「爲戲亂期內，提請覆議前臨時參議會決議之天目路拆屋　路成命，以解倒懸而重民意」案。然經議長解釋，在本會議事規則上，對於覆議，一項並未提到，故建議可否將案由稍予變更，結果通過案由為「為　亂期內，提請暫　拆除天　路房屋」案。</p>
<p>市長局長　表示意見</p>
<p>在未決議前，工務局　局長呱康表示天目路乃閘北交通摳紐，對都市計劃　進　極大關係，拓寬以後，於南北交通有很大帮助，故在技術上言，有拓寬必要。然對居民安定問題未便表示，但渠認為安定與建設實不能分開。</p>
<p>吳市長表示戡亂期內，拆屋確有困難。但建設市政為整個上海問題，如以天目路一案不能執行，則將來市政進展必受限制故寳成工務委員會之審查意見。討論結果，大會即根據審查意見加以修正，作爲決議：「本案爲居民陳訴困苦，深表同情，但歷經臨參會及本會迭次大會決議，並已奉行政院核准在案，爲兼顧當前事實，擬請市府會同本曾及居民代表，曁該區區公所及區民代表會代表，共同組織委員會，妥籌善後處嚴辦法後即行辦理。但其願意白動拆遷者，不在此例。</p>
<p>福州路上突出市房　請工務局統籌辦理</p>

<p>犯罪事實</p>
<p>毛　翔係上海怡豐行經理，卅五年八月間，該行代睦根記營　廠在美訂購白鐵皮四百噸，於去年九月始行運達上海，因之輸人許可證已逾期限，依章遠難進口。該行總經理毛豐翔及經理毛潤翔，意欲提貨，遂央方茂林輾轉囑託邵家振，郭子明等向江海關帮辦尹蘭蓀等行賄後，尹等違背職務，核准是項白鐵皮輸入。</p>

<p>查陸根記營造廉由怡　有居問，在　定購白鐵皮四百噸，迨去年九月運滬之時，因已逾限，須待申睛更改日期，始可進口，乃該行總經理毛豐翔等急欲提取，遂央方茂林向江海關帮辦尹蘭託梅福堂轉向江海關都辦尹　　等行賄之　實，又經保密局派員赴滬查明屬實，有原卷可稽。更據張高振供明，因陸根記白鐵皮事件，代爲說項所得之欶，以美金六百元分贈被吿邵家振·郭子明·基上參互以觀，被告毛豐翔·邵家振·郭子明·交付賄賂，已無疑義。</p>
<p>利豐水顏料行自美運達上海之安尼，林油及顏料，益豐公司自英運滬之羊毛，天和等行從美聯合運購之顏料，或於到達口岸業已逾限，或因輸入物品超過許可證所載數量，或無輸入許可證，而係借用他家之許可證，由被吿邵叔平·石亦屏·葉螽麟分別央託楊樹德向江海關帮辦尹蘭蓀等疏通，交付賄賂，計被吿邵叔平賄送國幣三億三千萬元，被吿石亦屏賄送國幣三億元，被吿　螽麟賄送國幣九千萬元，將依法不准進口之顏料等物，矇混輸入等情事，業據楊樹德一一指供屬實。</p>

<h3 id="c106">山西紀行　（一）　鐵城太原 <a href="#c106" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e106" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">106</a></h3>
<p>閻軍說：「我今年六十六歲了，我不把完整的山西交還國家，我決不離開！」</p>
<p>〔本報太原二日航訊〕抗戰勝利以後，匪共瘋在的竄擾，其間又有軍調小組給了匪共一個千載難逢的機會，於是廣大的華北之脊，到處染上了赤色，整個晋境只剩下了太原，大同，臨汾，運城四個孤立的據點。三萬發的砲彈轟毁了大同，但在斷垣殘壁之前，敵人終在無比堅强軍民的搏鬥下敗退了·運城隣陝省在黃河東岸，界河南則在河之北是縱貫晉省同蒲鐵路南端的重鎭，但在匪共數倍守軍的兵力以及來歷不明的百門大砲圍攻下，終吿失守，晋南的精華，包括民衆，及其一切財富在內，都損失淨盡。太原的不敢爲匪共窺視，固然是因爲去年太原西北孝義縣一役，打垮了賀龍的二十萬兵力所致，主要的還是閻錫山將軍從克難坡一路復員「打」進了太原以後，第一步着手的就是做工事，匪共的陰藏禍心，在他八年抗戰過程間，早看得雪亮了。太原城郊，密佈着千數以上的碉堡，火壘，由磗的建築改成鋼骨，水泥，正反映着匪共從赤手空拳已變遷到今日的挾有機槍，巨砲，問題也就不簡單了。</p>
<p>深溝高壘　火綱嚴密</p>
<p>記者團從南機塲一下飛機，首先映入眼簾的就是這些構成平原大火網的發射點，深溝高壘，防禦匪共波浪攻擊的堅强陣綫，恐怕是任何地方多及不上的。機塲滿堆着洋灰，碎石，火車往來奔馳，黃土平原上靜謐安寗，白鴿子還逗留在碉堡頂上浴日光。從整個軍事局勢上看，毛澤東帶着日俘飯瓦佐部的一萬多人盤據在晋西北的興縣，陳毅到達了晋東南翼城，陳賡由曲沃北回，王震的四個旅也向北推動，聶榮臻部從晋，察，綏邊區竄到了忻縣附近，二十萬左右的兵力，標的似乎多指向這座鐵城——太原，要說是進攻，最低估計要消耗四十萬人，所以推測用意可能是破壞晋省「兵農合一」的自衛機構，其次就是攫取保定，控制平津。「專守最後必失敗」，但是太原的今日却以守爲等待攻擊機會的手段，運城可說是前車之鑒，用兵只有零分和一百分，主力戰決不可免，正和匪共有一致命打擊亦決不可免一樣，我對於太原的强力武裝與太原區十八個縣市每一個軍民具有同樣的必勝信念。</p>
<p>政治設施　特立獨行</p>
<p>能了解這些客觀的環境，然後才能認識今日晋省心臟的一切政治設施的由來。山西過去是較爲保守和特殊的省份，現在還脫不掉這個規範，這原因當記者團晋謁問將軍的時候，他就坦白的這樣說：「我本是個軍人，我對政治上的一切措施，多是迫到眉睫不得不做的。」自淸，自衛，自治的「三自運動」；生活平等，是非平等，犧牲平等，勞動平等的「四平等」；反左右傾，反貪汚，反擾民，反剝削，反不平的「五反」和不許販毒，吸毒，賭博，僞裝，不公道，不勞動的「大不許」的「鬥爭」；以簡化生活，保護生活，分配工作，配購產物爲原則的「平民經濟」；以及針對匪共「土地改革」來解決中國社會經濟核心問題的土地問題的「兵農合一」等，這些到處可見的口號，辦法，在六十多歲的閻將軍可驚的思索力下，一一出現。從國家民族的觀點上看山西，誰多不能否認惟有這些法則少是在赤色狂瀾中使一個行政機構，屹然存在的基本條件，僅為爲着生活而終日愁眉覽額的人，今天已到了應該睜開眼睛來看一看爲着生死而鬥爭的人羣的時候了。</p>
<p>赤流砥柱　華北堡壘</p>
<p>山西的政治還有這樣一個特質，閻將軍像一個老祖父，現在跟隨着他的部下，全是過去他的幹部的子孫輩，手諭沒有一點公文氣息，像格言，家訓。他在四十年治理山西的過程中間，始終以他的人格，思想，精神和態度，使這個家族政治順利推行。山西的能成爲赤流砥柱，華北堡壘，這是個主要因素。</p>
<p>歷史傳說宋太祖改築太原新城，街道做成丁字形，於是山西的政治永遠「踫釘子」。「風水」一破，山西人便紛紛棄政從商，造成了淸咸豐，同治年間票號的極盛時代，及至禁軍府前面一條馬路一改十字形，就有閻錫山的革命軍從現在的首義門衝進了太原。</p>
<p>閻將軍在答覆記者的詢問時說：「我不考慮競選副總統，只考慮怎樣對付共匪。國家交給我一百零五縣一市的完整山西，到今天只剩了卅三縣一市，我眞對不起國家，按例六十二歲，我就可以退休，但我今年六十六歲了，我不把完整的山西交還國家，我決不離開！」（本報記者楊文育）</p>

<p>〔本報歸綏一一月廿八日航訊〕盤據滿城西北共匪聶榮臻的第六縱隊殘部，上月下旬曾在城南段旺村召開幹部會議，商討逃避我騎兵追剿辦法，決定通令各村幹部於衝要道口埋藏大量地雷，並令各村鋸伐大樹，於必要時應用。使共匪疲於奔命，必須以地雷廢材阻止前進的追剿部隊，便是記者在這裏報告的察綏野戰軍中的大靑山騎兵。</p>
<p>大靑山騎兵是綏遠人民自己搞起來的一支精旅，從廿六年秋天直到卅六年冬天，國家才發給他們優良的裝備。在此十年當中，大靑山騎兵整整有八年工夫，始終活躍在歸綏城北二十里的大青山里。抗戰初起，他們共有兩萬官官兵，經過五百多次主動的出擊，和一千餘次被動的掃蕩偷製，到抗戰勝利以後，祇剩下五千多槍馬齊全的精壯騎兵。他們以前的槍枝完全是日本人的槍枝，現在的馬匹完全是僞蒙軍的馬匹，政府沒有花一文錢，建立起一支縱橫華北的鐵騎，也是傅作義將軍主綏十六年來廉能政治的珍貴收穫。組織大靑山騎兵，和開關大靑山抗日游擊根據地的</p>
<p>第一個人</p>
<p>是武川保安隊隊長郭懷翰氏。當廿六年七月廬溝橋事變後，傅作義將軍奉令遠征察北，臨行呌地方士緝組織民衆自衛，郭懷翰就將武川原先十個區的保安險，成立起綏遠民衆抗日自衛軍第四路，歸現任綏遠高等法院院長于存灝指揮作戰。等到綏包淪陷以後，豐鎭的第一路，包頭的第二路，歸綏的第三路，托克托和淸水河的第五路，涼城的第六路，薩縣的第七路，固陽的第八路，大部都集中在大靑山中。廿七年春天，傅將軍反攻歸綏，和廿八年冬天傅將軍進人包頭，都有抗日自衛軍在敵人後方活動，起了很大的牽制作用。不料在廿九年春天，五原一度失守的時候，就首先遭受到共匪的吞併，當時製擊抗日自衛軍總部的，就是現在共匪綏蒙軍區司令姚　，和賀龍野戰三旅旅長李井泉，此次綏遠自衛軍蒙受的摧殘最大，幾乎把大靑山抗日根據地全部粉碎。　把大靑山抗日根據地重新收復回來，同時建立起大靑山騎兵的人，便是目前在</p>
<p>河北平原</p>
<p>作戰的鄂友三小將。鄂友三的出身非常寒微，他原先是薩拉齊縣　爾沁鎭郭姓的孩予，三歲時遭父母遺棄，被瑞典收師鄂必恪夫婦撫養成人·從歸綏中學畢業後，考入中央軍校九期騎科，南京棄守以後，他遷到四川成都總校担任敎官。聽到家鄉的父老兄弟在大靑山上抗戰，便辭職從四川徒步跟回綏遠，穿過敵人的封鎖，進山參加自衛軍前敵指揮部充任上尉參謀。廿九年共匪襲擊自衛軍前敵指揮部時，他在臨刑前一分鐘逃出，化裝成牧人把散兵收容在一起，兩天以後，自動將抗日根據地奪回，從此奠定了他在自衛軍中的領導地位。</p>
<p>卅四年春天，將軍　作義把在後套訓練的美式　備軍，亦讓鄂友三指揮在敵後作戰，他和美國顧問，經常駐在薩縣城北二十里的水澗溝門，日本兵住在歲縣城舊綏的火車站和包頭的西腦包，入晚以後就成了鄂友三的世界。這期間，大靑山騎兵為報復廿九年的仇恨，並將共匪在大靑山井爾溝建立的根據地搗毁。傳作義將軍如果沒鄂友三這一支部隊在敵後活動，恐怕接收綏包　　增加不少麻煩，保衛綏包時也要不能在兩塵孤島中自由呼吸。鄂友三少將於</p>
<p>綏包解圍</p>
<p>後共擁有一百多騎兵和步兵值將軍把他的騎兵改編成全省的保安師，將步兵遣散回武川，固陽，陶林，戰縣充任地方團隊，老弱殘廢由鄂友三收容到島蘭花附近屯田。鄂友三在大靑山區的聲望，僅次於傳學黨兩位將軍，前年恤進攻集寗時，共有三千多民團協助他追擊賀龍　部隊·去年一年內，傅作義將軍就依靠鄂友三的大靑山騎兵，和一個步兵師安定察綏後万，並收復了雁北的左雲右玉，遠征陝北解第一次榆林之園。</p>
<p>經過十年鍜鍊的大靑山騎兵，從去年秋天正式編成國防勁旅，今年一月開到河北，和另一支綏遠騎兵，好像傅作議將軍的兩把寳劍，指向聶榮臻的匪巢。</p>
<p>鄂友三少將，今年才三十七歲，已經受傷二十餘次，直到現在膝頸和小腿上，還有</p>
<p>兩顆子彈</p>
<p>沒有取出。十年的游擊生活，把鄂友三和他的官兵，都鍜鍊成野馬一般壯健。鄂友三每天深夜睡覺，天亮以前起床，他像馬一樣的用間段的休息，代替足時的睡眠。鄂友三少將的成功，證明民衆武力的偉大，傅作議將軍培植大靑山騎兵，也給許多軍事首腦人物，指出一條打破險惡環境的光明道路。（本報記者劉映元）</p>

<p>〔本報無錫通訊〕本縣絲紗麵粉糧食各業，狃於積習，每年結束，仍在農歷之歲尾年頭，値此陰歷戊子新正中旬，各業對於丁亥年之盈虧，業已全部揭露。</p>
<p>綜合去年各業結賬情况，似較上年爲佳，蓋因各業雖受幣値彼動影響，每呈法幣增多，貨物减少之反常現象，但以各業主持人類多謹愼從事，故在陰歷十二月二十四日左右，均已籌集頭寸，安渡結賬難關。一至大小除夕雖有現歟放出，亦已乏人問津，與上年之大小除夕，商店忙於調頭寸之狀態，適得其反。</p>
<p>更可慶辛者，關於倒賬事件，除投機棉紗麵粉失敗之范家驊倒賬七億餘元，潛逃無踪外，其餘各商家，安然渡過，並無此類事件發生。茲將各業盈虧槪况，約述於下：</p>
<p>粉廠</p>
<p>麵粉廠一業，其範圍較大者，有茂新·九豐·增豐·廣豐·華新·等七八家，去年因北運暢通，而原料價格，雖時有波動，終因粉價以麥價爲標準，水漲船高，自無影響，各廠實力雄厚，大部原料，均於一事前置辦，日夜開工，出數充沛，行銷谷地，其營業之盛，爲近幾年來所未有，因此獲利頗豐。在全縣各業中，堪稱首屈一指。</p>
<p>紗廠</p>
<p>在去年上半年，實爲紗廠業之黃金時代，大廠如慶豐所出之二十支雙魚紗，爲錫邑棉紗市塲之標準紗，牌子著名，頗受顧客歡迎，固屬財源茂盛，獲利無算。其次申新振新紗廠，範圍亦大，獲利尤豐。此外中小型紗廠，亦呈蓬勃氣象，各有盈餘，與粉廠不相上下。布廠因開支過巨，在年終結賬時，稍有盈餘。</p>
<p>絲廠</p>
<p>全縣有五十餘家，去年各廠在物價在潮中，營業蒸蒸日上，大廠均爲政府代繅性質，故盈餘極少。而中小型絲廠，在春繭汎後，一帆順風，絲價波動劇烈，尤以用戶絲銷路最佳，終因原料缺乏，各廠提早停工。總之去年的絲廠業，較三十五年的絲廠業爲佳。</p>
<p>米糧</p>
<p>此間糧食市塲，營業之隹，爲京滬綫各縣之冠。各地客商，將米稻·小麥·雜糧，載運來錫者，絡繹不絕，每天交易，總數在二萬担以上。各米行代客賣買，專收佣金，一般掮客，在上午十時，各持樣包，紛至市塲議價。去年米價暴漲，一跳再跳，因此全縣二百餘家米行，營業鼎盛，大都獲利。其資力雄厚之隆茂米行，盈餘達二百億左右，義德米行亦餘六十億以上。碾米廠業，營業亦隹，均呈有盈無虧狀態。</p>
<p>銀錢</p>
<p>去年銀錢業各錢莊，以放賬平穩，終年未受倒賬等影響，均獲厚利。尤以永恒豐，增大等錢莊，獲利最豐。合作社及地下錢莊，其盈餘之多，更足駐人聽聞。商業銀行亦有盈餘，但與地下錢莊比較，則膛乎其後矣。</p>
<p>油廠</p>
<p>錫邑油廠一業，資本雄厚者，有恒德·潤豐·建成·三家，每天出數，在二千担以上，在黃豆到貨充塞下，各廠油池盈滿，有無法堆存之處。去年油偎一度萎靡，惟在年終則風頭獨健，屢創新高價，每担已出四百萬大關。因此各廠有利可圖，油行家除源春隆·源春新·一大三家，各有盈餘外，源大等各家，維持開支，其他各號，則盈虧不一。</p>
<p>旅館</p>
<p>旅館業範圍較大者，有泰山·中國·京滬·惠中等四家，處此物價波動，經濟狂潮中，影響整個營業，大多虧本。而中南·大陸·天然·萬新·等旅館，均相繼添資，重行改組。其他各旅店亦賴高利貸維持，飲鴆止渴。均有倒懸之勢。菜館業除迎賽樓稍有盈餘外，聚豐園等類多虧耗，中等菜館楊添興等，因開支節省，客賬較少，故亦有少許盈餘云。</p>

<h3 id="c164">關於石鼓文的時代答童書業先生 <a href="#c164" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e164" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">164</a></h3>
<p>— 唐蘭</p>
<p>蒙翟鐘秀先生的好意，由無錫前寄來一月七日的上海中央日報文物周刋第六十八期，有童書業先生的『評唐蘭先生石鼓文刻於秦靈公三年考』一文，讀過後很高興。我寫那篇文章，早就預備挨駡。因爲一般人的保守性總是很强的。我說石鼓的時代是戰國，別人一定）要說是秦文公，秦襄公，秦穆公，還有人說成王，宣王，也有人說北周，後魏，紛紜聚訟，執持成見，本是無可奈何的事情。不過在這個兵荒馬亂，薪桂米珠的時候，還有人來討論這些無用的問題，空谷足音，總應該是高興的。</p>
<p>童先生的大交裏最値得感謝的，是我說石鼓用「過」字十一處，承他校正做十四處。（還有幾處，童先生引原文而加間號，我想這總是手民之誤吧？）關於這個『避』字的問題，童先生費了很大的氣力，找出了尙書裏第一人稱代名詞有：「予」，「我」，「朕』等字，『予』字用在單數主格，和金文『余』字相當，『朕』字多用在單數領格，而單數，多數，主格，領格，都可用『我』字。因此，童先生說我『只注意了領格主格的區別，却忽略了單數多數的分別』，所以他又說我『沒有把先秦文法弄淸楚」，『更不幸的是連兩三件銘刻的文字用法也沒有分析淸楚』</p>
<p>尙書裏的代名詞，北京大學文科研究所同學王達津先生曾經研究過，那是四五年前的畢業論文，第一人稱代名詞和童先生所說差不多，不過『我』字似乎專用在多數。這篇論文，我還參加過一些意見，所以『我』字代表多數，還不致於忘記。</p>
<p>我在這裏應該先謝謝童先生，讓我覺得我寫的文字還不能使老嫗都解，這是很可慚愧的。不過我也很可惜，以童先生的聰明而作這種無益的，文不對題的討論。尙書周害用「予」，『朕』，「我」三字，它可沒有用「吾」字啊！石鼓文用「避」字，詛楚文用『衙』字，據童先生說，就是『我』字，這眞够把人鬧迷糊了。我們眞不懂得，石鼓文詛楚文旣然都有『我』字，爲什麽還要另外寫做『　』或「梧」呢？這兩個字顯然都從「吾」得聲，『吾』古　在魚部，爲什麼不就代表經典的『吾』字和春秋以後東方金文的「慮」字，而反去代表古音在歌部的『我』字呢？</p>
<p>商周銘刻用「我」字地方很多，秦公募秦公鐘雖沒有用到，我們相信那時一定也行用。但是用『吾』字作代詞，在尙書周書，在春秋以前金文裡是從來沒有的所以我們說在這樣一個時期裏，所用的只有『余』（或予），『朕』，「我」，而不用「吾」。但是在周易·論語，孟子等書，除了引古書，就用「予」，「吾」，「我」，而不用「朕」，春秋以後東方銅器像齊　，汍兒鐘，杜氏壼等，用「余」，「慮」（或　），「我」，而不用『朕』。這裏的界限本是狠淸楚的。所以我的原文只是說明秦公　時代用『朕』而不用『吾』石鼓文詛楚文時代用「吾」而不用「朕」。因爲我們旣無法證明秦民族先用「吾」這個語言，後來改做「朕」後來再改做「吾」，我們就只好把石鼓文移後，放在詛楚文一起了。到了秦始皇時，天子自稱爲『朕』，就因爲這是已發的語言，要不然，秦始皇儘管有魄力也不能把人們通用的稱謂，立時就禁絕啊！</p>
<p>現在童先生把『　』字認作「我」，又牽涉到多數少數的問題，這眞是「張公吃酒李公醉』了。詩經上明明說『我車旣攻，我馬旣同』，石鼓文套這個調子，却變做『吾車旣工，吾馬旣同』，這就是天大的一個漏洞。不過，如其說『吾』就是「我」，歌部的字，應該諧魚部的聲，石鼓文詛楚文的並列，只是爲寫得好玩，胡適之先生的大作吾我篇大可以不作，我也無奈他何。</p>
<p>至於『沒』字和『也』字的間題，童先生說秦誓「猗」字就是「設」字，也是我所不懂得的。童先生又說「猗」字也就是『兮』字，禮記大學引秦誓的『猗』作『兮』，這是可靠的。只可惜在童先生是自相矛盾，因爲『兮』字並不等於『也』字，例如「叔兮伯兮，何多日也』，我們不能把『兮』和「也」顚倒過來。那末，「猗」旣同『兮』，就無關於「也」，『毆』只同『也』，又何必拉上了「猗」呢？至於秦風權輿說：『今也每食無餘』，不知應屬何時，詩序說是刺康公，不知是不是可信。金石文字和竹帛文字的體製不同，金石文字保守性較軍，即使當時已用『也』字，在金石文字裏儘可以沒有用到。『也』字在東方各國大概早已盛行，可是一直到春秋末年的陳常甸量才看見「也」字，正是這個原故，我在陳常匋量考裏早就說明過了。唐宋的語言，大部分已和現在一樣，可是「你等』，『我每』，一直到現在，還不常見於金石，這是同樣的情形。</p>
<p>童先生說我『不是不讀書的人』，我不懂得書是怎麼讀法，如其照童先生的說法，『殹』就是「猗」，『猗』通『兮』，所以「隊』等於『兮』，像這樣讀法的書，我確是沒有讀過，幷且也不屑去讀。（朱駿聲因毛詩兮也二字，他書所引或互易，就認爲通用，那末，我們何以不把毛詩楚辭的『兮』字通寫做「也』，或把「也』字通寫做「兮」呢？詩經用『維』字，尙書用「惟』字，古人用字的界限最淸楚。兩句之中，『兮』『也』同見，可見決不相通。古人抄書常有錯誤，一二字的異文，不足爲據。朱氏把這種界限打破了，眞是誤盡蒼生。）</p>
<p>童先生一再說我『武斷』，又一再說我『中了現在最時髦的但問實物，不問文獻的學風的毒」。『武斷』兩字，我不想接受。如其我把不同來源的材料，例如一個是棄時人自己寫刻的刻石，而其餘的却是經過不同時代，不同地域的許多人傳抄下來的東西，而作嚴格的文字或文法的比較，我就得承認我的方法有錯誤。現在我只用「金石銘刻』，只用「秦國的金石銘刻』來比較，時代的前　，只有幾百年，我不相信這個方法是錯誤的。墨子把金石和竹帛分開，秦二世詔把金石刻並稱，所以刻在刻石上，也同時刻在權量上，可見金石文字自成一個系統。例如古書裏用『予」竄先王自己承認相當於金文的『余」字就等於說金文不用「予』字這難道是「武斷』嗎？我在原文裏說「兩周金文不用「予」字，石鼓文「迂」字偏旁從「予」』，我根本沒想到會牽扯到古書裏用作代名詞的『予』字，因爲那在金文裏是寫做『余』的，我所說的只是字的形體，所以用『偏旁』來作證。童先生恐怕沒有把我的話看淸楚，纏夾二起來，以爲我是把代名詞的「予』或『余』認爲後出，所以說『未免有些武斷」了。</p>
<p>至於中毒與否，我倒不想辨白，因爲中過毒的人自己也許不知道。不過，我却希望中的是『實事求是』的毒。對於一個字的用法要「分析』得『淸楚』些，『先秦文法』也『弄淸楚」些，不要認甲作乙，即甲即乙，東拉西扯，把所有的材料，不一定同等的材料，攪做一團亂糟糟。</p>
<p>『辟』，『殺』，『迂』，是我考訂石鼓文時代的根據，只要我們平心靜氣去想一下，是非是不難定的。這都是十分明白而確實的證據，在沒有提出前，固然可以歷千載而不悟，可是一注意到了，連我自己也失笑，這樣近在眼前而且狠淺顯的事實，怎麼會糊塗了二三十年呢？現在，這是一個前提，假使我沒有『武斷」什麽，石鼓文就得放到景公以後去，否則我所說的都是丐詞，所以童先生別的評語，我就用不着答覆了。</p>
<h3 id="c165">骰子起源考 <a href="#c165" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e165" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">165</a></h3>
<p>— 常任俠</p>
<p>我曾發表過中國象棋起源於印度考，因思中國的骰子，與印度也有關係。骰子是一種六面方體的小小娛樂用具，以象牙，獸骨，或是別的質料製成。在世界各國，多用於賭博的游戲，中國亦然。骰子的起源，據湯麥斯哈代（ThonasHyce）的意見，應是由指節骨進化而來。在古代的記載中，還有一種便用石子，擲出單數或雙數的游戲，這也應是與之同時發展的玩具。骰子有六面，刻記着一到六的圓點，賭者大率在二人以上。每具用得最多的可以到六個，但普通只用二個或三個，尤以二個爲最常見。</p>
<p>擲股子這種游戲，大槪起於東方亞洲，在美索不達米亞，曾發現一個陶土製的骰子，是紀元前二七五〇年的潰物。在中印度王舍城（Rajagriha）也發現一個紅陶燒的股子，現藏印度加城考古收藏者阿吉諦叩西（Ajit　ghoce）處。王舍城在佛降生前西紀前六七世紀時，便是擊竭陀王國的古都，而且林憲祥君，曾於此發現石器時代的石斧所以這骰子雖出土不明，王大概是兩千六七百年前的東西·（王舍城當晋法顯來遊時，業已早成廢墟，荒蕪無人了。）此外史密孫研究所（Smithsonian　institution）也曾藏有三個古代的骰子，一個是古代埃及的，兩個是古代羅馬的。都與現代中國的印度的骰子，完全相　。骰子西人稱爲Dice，與中國的名字，發音頗爲相近.在古希臘時代，骰子是一種非常普遍的娛樂玩具。古希臘人稱之爲Tec　ares，古羅馬人稱爲Teseerae，拉丁文作Tescera，即由古希臘文而來。其原意爲四，因為表示　是四方體的東西。</p>
<p>古　馬人非常嗜好　種娛樂。馬爾古，安東尼（Mark　Antony）在亞歷山大里亞，日以擲骰子爲事。奧古斯特大帝，（Emperaro　Auguotus）尼羅（Nero），以及古雷狄斯（Claucius）都熱切嗜好這個。古雷狄斯並且還寫過一本書，關於擲骰子的游戲。卡力勾拉（Caligula）是一個劣跡昭著的擲骰子的驅子。多迷檀（Domitian）也歡喜玩骰子，並且康毛狄斯，（Commodns）為了　骰子，還建築一所特別的房子在他的皇宮裏。安妥紐斯（Antoninus）的養子維魯斯（Verus）皇帝，是人所週知的爲了擲骰子而能通夜在一起酣賭。這些事實都見於古文獻的記載。而且就今天在古墓中發掘得的骰子來證明，可知其決非虎搆。</p>
<p>在古代埃及遺留的建築物上，便描繪着骰子，這個是在台比斯（Thebes）被發掘出來，僅此便能使我們今天很淸楚的知道古代玩骰子的情形。這種擲骰子的遊戲，在古代的希臘與羅馬，是很普遍的。至於發明創造骰子的人，則歸之於帕拉默德斯（Palamedes），約爲西歷紀元前一二四四年時人。這個希臘人，他當圍困在台羅契（Troy）的時候，以這游戲去敎他的國人。他後來被做爲祭品而獻給運命之神廟的祭壇。今天我們從古代遺留品上去推想，用骰子去賭博，或者更早於這個時期的。</p>
<p>骰子在印度，在王舍城旣發見了很古的遣物，而且在很古的頌神待集黎俱吠陀（Rigveca）中，也使會述及。這是一部西歷紀元前二千年的書，所以骰子在印度，已有四千年的歷史。另一部紀元前八世紀的書Upanisad（奧義書），也講到骰子，名爲Aksa，在古印度著名的大史詩馬哈巴拉塔中，曾講到爲了賭骰子而輸去一切的王子。一直到今天，骰子還是印度人極普遍的賭具。並且西藏人尼泊爾人對此也非常嗜好，我遊寫馬拉雅山大吉嶺時曾看見他們一二五聚賭骰子的情形。據大英百科全書說：這　具是起源於亞洲，縱不敢斷言印度是其最早的產地，但印度在古代就已流行，這確是裏實。</p>
<p>骰子在中國的傳說，發明人歸之於老子·道光元年刊的救世針砭說：老子到苗民區，看見苗以每日閑看，因呌以股子的賭法。救世針砭雖不是很古的書，這傳說却也有所根據，太平御覽七百二十六引博物志說：老子入西戎浩　蒲，與這傳說正是同一的來源。但　蒲與現金的骰子不同，我們却應常知道。至於現今已發現的中國最早的骰子，却另是一種，與歐洲印度所傳的骰子都不類。據友人衛聚賢來信說：以前商承祚兄曾在北平購到一顆石質的方寸大的骰子，爲十四面，現在的骰十爲六面，因立方體的六面去八個角共成十四面。上刻文字而非點子。文為一二三三　　十八九－廿卅　，共十三個數目字，有一面無字。賭法本詳。錫永的原物我未見，就聚賢麽寫的文字看，這骰子應該很古，文字與股墟甲骨文字相同，七書作十，十書作－，甲骨文便是如此·這種骰子，在中國古謂之瓊，以係玉質石質故名。投瓊去博弈，與今賭牌九打馬將先擲骰子相同。中國故獻中，所譅六博，所謂五木，所謂呼雉喝盧，所謂樓蒲，所謂六箸，所謂博塞，都不是用現今的骰子，我另有老一證。不過北方人稱玩骰子爲　塞（音色）子，却是沿用的中國古名。到六朝時遺存的古磁中，曾見一顆方寸大的骰子，與古埃及古羅馬的古墓由所發掘的骰子，以及今天印度的骰子，完全相同。這骰子舊藏國立藝專敎授李超士處，據超士說得自浙江餘姚，也是古墓所出。今藏衛聚賢處。這是我所知道的中國發見與古埃及同型的骰子最早的一個。</p>
<p>由骰子發展爲牙牌，這是中國獨有的玩藝。以骰子上面的兩面的點子，合爲一組，就成爲一張牙牌。錯綜配合，便成爲三十二張。骰子可以說是牙牌的基礎，若果不先有股子，便不會有後來的牙牌。用牙牌卜卦的風俗，很流行於中國的民間，本來以牌占卜，世界多有，骰子在用作購博以前，也可能是用作占卜決定的東西，與今日之擲雙擲單或用一個錢幣去擲背擲面，情形相似。中國的六壬課，是用錢三枚去占卜的，在盒子搖擲，這與用骰子的方法，完全相似，其根源很可能便是一個。</p>
<p>中國的葉子戲，是骰子以外的另一種賭具。今天的麻雀牌，便是由葉子發展而來。形似牙牌而實非牙牌。據胡適博士的廬山遊記說：他曾收集過各地的葉子，這要讓他的考據癖，來追尋根底了。（一九四七年一月，印度國際大學）。</p>

<p>— 徐規</p>
<p>（沈括編年事緝，張蔭麟教著，載清華學報第十一卷第二期，民國二十五年四月出版。已收入遺者「宋史論叢」中。）</p>
<p>按宋史沈括傳載：「元祐初，徙秀州」。又長興集十六謝謫授秀州團練副使表云：「伏蒙吿命，授臣秀州團練副使，本州安置」。可知沈括在奉到新命以前，不能離秀州。蔭麟師原文元祐四年條有「括之遷居京口夢溪，必在是年進圖受奬奉旨許任便居住後」云云。據李　續資治通鑑長編元祐三年八月丙子（三日）條載：「秀州團練副使本州安置不得簽書公事沈括，賜絹百匹，仍從便居止，以括上編修天下州縣圖故也」。此事並見宋會要輯稿刑法六之二十，但作八月十三日。可知進圖受奬乃元祐三年而非四年之事。又所謂「仍從便居止」者，指仍許在秀州境內從便居止之意，非謂許於秀州以外之州軍任便居住也。又長興集十六謝分司南京表云：「今月十九日，潤州差人送到官吿一通，伏蒙聖恩，授臣左朝散郞，守光祿少鄉，分司南京，許於外州軍任便居住」。長編繁此命於元祐五年十月戊戌（七日）。許於外州軍任便居住，則南京以外亦可居住也。此為其行動從此可自由之重要證據。假定元祐五年十月新命到達即遷居　州，則宋史本傳所謂「居潤八年卒，年六十五」者，應從元祐五年（一〇九〇）起算，歷八年，當爲紹興四年（一〇九七）。若以紹聖四年卒，年六十五，上雅其生年，當爲明道二年（一〇三三），與原文所謂生於明道元年者不符。其遷居潤州是否即在元祐五年，抑或六年，雖不可確知，但不在元祐五年十月以前，則無疑問·據此，沈括不生於明道元年，而在明道元年以後，固彰彰明甚。除非宋史本傳原文有誤耳。</p>
<p>又長編元祐四年九月己丑（二十二日）條載：「韶責授秀州團練副使黃州安置沈括叙朝散郞光祿少卿，責授成州團練副使黃州安置吳居厚敘朝奉郞少府少監，並分司南京；（中略）仍並許於外州軍任便居住·」此命旋因梁　劉安世之反對，故同凡即有韶「沈括吳居厚前命勿行，內沈括更候一期取旨」之語。但有一點可注意者，即元祐四年九月己　之前，沈括已移黃州安置·至謝分司南京表中有潤州差人送到之語，多以爲沈括在收到官告之前，已選居潤州，似未注意「許於外州軍任便居住」爲確定其行動良由之重要命令，須知限定居止爲一種處分，不限定居止則爲此種處分之撤廢，必須有明令乃得自由行動也。謝表所以指出潤州者，恐以潤州爲當時水路交通一衝要地，一部分文移以其地爲輸送之一起點故也。</p>

<p>— ·丁則良·</p>
<p>最近文史週刊編輯部轉來浙江大學徐規先生給我的一封信和他寫的「沈括編年事輯」校後記一文，我一面對徐先生這種指正的熱誠表示敬佩，一面也要對文史週刊編輯先生致謝·徐先生對於沈括生卒年一問題的意見和我在「沈括生卒年考」（載上海大公報又史週刊第二十九期）中的不同。其主要的差異在於徐先生認爲沈括居潤州，始於元祐五年，而我認爲始於元祐四年九月至十二月之間。其實我從前也曾持過和徐先生相同的看法·在民國二十九年五月三十日出版的益世報史學副刊渝版第五期上，我曾寫過「跋沈括編年事輯」一文·關於沈括的生卒年，我的結論和現在徐先生的一樣，我說：</p>
<p>「括自元豐貶謫後，其眞得任便居住，當在元祐五年十月。其遷居京口，（即潤州），亦當在是年。以居潤八年計之，當卒於紹聖四年，而其生年乃在明道二年（公元一〇三三至一〇九七年）。張（蔭麟）氏所輯沈氏事跡，悉早一歲云·」</p>
<p>不但結論一樣，而且所用的論據也同是長編卷四四九元祐五年十月七日戊戌條。我那一篇小文，曾請張先生看過，張先生曾在文中加過按語，對我的結論，很表同意。後來，我的意見有變動，又曾函浙大吿知張先生，並將論據一一提出，張先生回信，也頗以這新的意見爲然。最近沈括生卒年考一文就是根據這變動後的意見寫出來的。</p>
<p>我何以改用新的意見，沈括生卒年考一文所用的諸論據，可爲說明，這裏不再贅述·對於徐先生的意見，我願提出三點懷疑，以供討論。按長與集卷十六謝分司南京表所云：「潤州差人送到官吿一道」云云，似乎可以暗示沈括這時（元祐五年十月以前）已經住在潤州。自來不乏巧合之事，如沈括這時不住潤州，而偏由潤州差人送來官吿，沈括得到之後，又遝居潤州，豈不太巧？此其一·如果他這時不在潤州，而在黃州，黃潤相去甚遠，爲什麼政府公文，不直接送黃州，由黃州差人送去而一定要由潤州從千里外差人送去？這是很費解的。此其二·徐先生說潤州是「當時水路交通一衝要地，一部分文移以其地爲輸送之一起點」，不曉得此說有無根據？如能在這一事之外，舉出其他實例，證明北宋確有以潤州爲一輸送文移之起點的辦法，這一論斷或可成立。此其三。</p>
<p>我覺得沈括生卒年一問題，因現存史料有限，而且文辭籠統，不易作肯定的結論。說他是元祐四年九月後居住潤州吧，却與元祐五年十月戊戌的詔命不全符合。說他是元祐五年十月以後纔住在潤州罷，而官吿却又是由潤州差人送來。無論哪一說，都有困難。我現在對我的意見也不滿意，希望徐先生和世之治宋史者有以敎我。　卅六，六，九，淸華園</p>

<h3 id="c171">論浪費 <a href="#c171" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e171" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">171</a></h3>
<p>— 季用</p>
<p>在中國浪費是必需的，與在他國，大不相同。美國人講究効率，餐館要「自助」，電車買票，糖果店買食品，以及其他一切可以拿一隻角子或五分線幣就代替一個活人管理的事，總以省下活人的力量爲主，他們並不是省下人力去吃喝玩樂，消磨無聊的時光，而是有更大更重的工作要人去作。但在中國，這便行不通，中國缺少的是機器，而有餘的是人力。人力一旦被機器代替，便會丟了飯盌，以至於啼飢號寒，更進一步是造反，作强盜。所以，當初外國鬼子想在中國造鐵道，中國的御史老爺們就彈章交上，認爲這是使人民失業造成亂子的根源，萬萬要不得的東西，同治初年英人所造的淞滬鐵路，竟因此而停車，由中國政府以二十多萬兩銀子收質，沉在海灣裏。</p>
<p>你能說這事頑固嗎？前淸眞的因鐵路的紛爭而亡了江山，八國聯軍眞的由京津鐵路浩浩蕩蕩殺奔北京，就是七七抗戰之先，一條北寗路也還是日本人運兵的大動脈，像這樣的鐵道，有時簡直會使人感到「有不如無！」至於軍閥時代的內戰，完全是鐵路沿綫白姓遭殃，還不在話下。鐵路是如此，再看所謂政府機關，自從前淸末年，就鬧着裁　冗員，至今幾已百年，冗員還是裁也裁不盡，去冬行政院甚至分配了數目，命各機關照裁，實在這個辦法狄覺得也很該考慮，蓋中國的人才雖不多，庸才却是不少，這些人好容易在大小機關費盡九牛二虎之力找了一盌飯吃，一凡裁下來，試問又添了多少啼飢號寒之人？—即使什麽什麼一計畫有日實現，恐此輩只會等因奉此或是　案抄寫的「災官」們也無所用之，因此，就迎帶了多少種事物不能驟然改革，公文旅行，不能减少幾個彎子和站頭，畫行擬　核辦，不能少幾個「　峯」，公務機關不能不少訂幾分報，以供此輩無聊消遣，同時也就不能不多　茶房，以供侍應，而資官派，至於紙烟茶水，……等等開銷，更是附帶的繁榮。假令眞的斬釘截鐡，澈底維新，你看要牽涉到多少人？這一個不安，可是比每月多支出若干政費或公事躭誤若干時間損失大得多，「謀國者不可不愼！」古人云，兩害相衡取其輕，所以我們不妨說，在中國社會上，辦事以浪費爲第一，効率爲失計，不信你看，因爲打倒了專門浪費人力時間的舞廳，使　惹起那麽大的糾紛，鳴呼，浪費豈能隨便禁止哉！</p>
<p>抑尤有甚者，不主張浪費的人，有時覺得非常對，至少對自己不會有何害處，然而也就會有例外，近讀「梁燕孫年譜，」宣梳元年　，　哀世凱因與攝政王不協，被罷黜，因而運帶影變到其同黨郵傳部尙書陳璧文云：</p>
<p>「不久，御史謝遠涵即奏</p>
<p>參郵傳部尚書陳　多款，牽連及先生並部員多人，（先生指梁燕孫，時爲鐵路總局局長）蓋受某當道之指，兼承不滿意於郵傳部者之囑託而爲之也。時某當道欲倒陳以孤袁之勢，兼爲舊督辦鐵路之某公報復，（指盛宣懷）得此大喜，擬旨命大學士孫家　那相查辦，二人頗瞭解一切內容，且澈查賬目，弊賽毫無所得，將據實覆奏，會袁項城罷政，又陳尙書以崇陵工程及攝政王府第兩事，失產裕太后及攝政王之歡，〔原註：陳尙書歷辦大工程，以精核著稱，故旨派充崇陵工程大臣，向例此類大工，祗三成左右到工，餘皆以賂當道及分肥，陳尙書與同派二大臣會商估計款數，其二人估一千二百萬兩，陳自負內行云：「我切實從事，七百萬兩即可數用。」二人默然，遂罷議。未數日，奉旨：「陳　毋庸充崇陵工程大臣！」聞有人以蜚語上聞，謂『大行皇帝（光絡）苦了一世，到安葬的時候，陳璧還要刻薄他！」隆裕（光緒之后）聞之，椎心刺骨，非革陳旨不可，適攝政王欲覓地興建府第，有人故意吿以郵傳部衙署地方之佳，而陳尙書意又不捨，攝政王大怒，二者交集，而孫那二人雖欲不入陳之罪而不可得矣！〕因文致其罪，奏上，陳尙書交部議處革職，部員降革有差。…」</p>
<p>陳　想不浪費，結果不但自已丟官，同僚也因之倒霉，豈不是殷鑒不遠？由是知道，也許平常我們見了官吏就駡他貪汚，可能是寃枉了人，至少在動機上不是完全個人要如此，而必有「非如此不可」的原因在焉；旣是這樣，浪費二字，在中國豈不就是效率，而效率也者，又豈不就是浪費乎？</p>
<p>這自然是謬論，請原諒。（編者按：美水利工程專家搭德來華監督黃河復堤工程時，余曾問渠何不與築輕便鐵道，以期節省時間。塔氏正色日：此種工程，人力以愈浪費愈佳。蓋爲工賑計，誠欲受賑者之多多益善也。余聞之慨然，而塔氏乃睨余大笑。）</p>

<p>但是，天無絕人之路，機塲上倒總算還有通到人國去的長途電話設備。於是那位美國代表先打一個電話到紐約長途電話總站，再由紐約總站打一個長途電話給電話公司在柏林的負責人，呌他派車子到那機塲去。這幾個長途電話往返經過了九千英里的路程，造成「呌汽車電話』的新紀錄。（平）</p>
<h3 id="c173">春游 <a href="#c173" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e173" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">173</a></h3>
<p>— 何苦</p>
<p>讀萬卷書，不如行萬里路，古人已經說過，出游是比讀死書好。上海上一個商業都市，從「利」的一點而言，行萬里路，更其是可以獲得滿載而歸的打算。戰時有好多人不惜肩負担挑，甘願受到敵人的槍戳刀擊，羞辱汚駡，流轉於京滬杭綫，實行其旅行職業－單幫者，就是因爲跋涉道途之能獲利極颶也。</p>
<p>勝利之後，更大的單帮出現了，坐了空中霸王到北平，乘了招商局輪船到台灣，或是附總統號郵船到香港，除了日用開銷可以不費分文外，兼能獲得一筆豐厚的利潤，雖然這一種「事業」不是常人可以辦到，至少要有一點來歷或「道行」的人物才能動定咸宜，要足以說明今日之行萬里路，是一種生產事業，和徐霞客時代大不相同矣。</p>
<p>不過這一種行萬里路的手段，功利觀念太深，失掉了出游的眞正意義，不在本文所說的春游範圍之內。若是我們理想中的春游，應該是「冠者五六人，童子六七人，浴乎沂，風乎舞為，詠而歸」的境界。至於春服旣成與否，那倒不必考慮。事實上重游者不軍服，何况現在要做一襲春服，代價太大，爲了出游而裁製春服，更其非吾輩所能立辦。友人中有為自己衣服打算者，已在開始裁製夏季凡立丁西裝，買料裁製，一裘夏服在一千五百萬元以上，聽聽就够可怕。而且照他的計劃，我們的春服應該在去年秋季就要打算，旣然沒有預先經營，還是以隨遇而安的好，儘管是一身舊衣裳，不論土堆上，石罅旁，湖灘畔，都可坐下。如其是簇新的衣服，反要使你受累，作爲衣冠奴隸，未免不大合算。</p>
<p>春游的第二個條件，最好要遇到好天氣。我們在決定出去的一天，因為精神好，也許覺得下雨也無所謂，可是下雨倒底是煞風景的一件事。以我自己的經驗來講，有一次到杭州去，第一天第二天天氣都很好，明媚的陽光照着近水遠山，自有一種令人歡欣鼓舞的氣態。到第三天陰雨凄其，上保俶塔的只剩我們四個游客，未免感到陰沈沈的孤單。而遠矚湖景，給務氣　罩着，像是隔了磨砂玻瞝看街景，其不爽快的情形，你或許可以想像得之。因為游客大多喜歡明朗的色彩，凡風和日暖的日子，郊野的景色一定明朗如畫。</p>
<p>鄙人第一次游杭州，時在求學時代，爲了要相當費用，特先寫信徵求父親同意。父親回信來絕對同意，函末並說起他自己「堪恨壓綫年年，殊辜負此大好春光」云云。現在是輪到自己壓綫年年的日子了，因此每年的大好春光，都是「堪恨」下去。所以春海最重要而非最末的一個條件便是有空閑的身體。今日的旅行機會不可說不多，旅行團體風起雲涵，可是祗有一天二天，走馬看花的「到此一游」，殊非眞正的春游。世界上沒有用買米買菜的錢去旅行的人，因此趁着自己有空閑的機會去出游，也是一件極難的難事。這裏面就使我們相信一個人多少要有一點「福份」，才能够談春游。而且還要結一個同樣與你有福份的伴侶，人生得一知己，暢游隹山隹水，這是一個理想的境界，幾千個人中間或許難找出一對來！</p>
<p>寫到這裏，眞覺得此時此地談春游，不但是一難事，而且是一件奢侈的事了，愈想愈難，祇得　筆大吉。</p>
<h3 id="c174">救濟隱貧 <a href="#c174" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e174" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">174</a></h3>
<p>— 張蕉心</p>
<p>市財政局職員陳濠，以夫人患病兩月，　力醫治，又不忍坐視，竟投浦自殺。財政局各同仁激於必同情，發起募捐，爲陸夫人診治。這是人類互助的表現，孟子說：「疾病相扶助」，正是人羣應盡的義務。</p>
<p>在這物價飛騰，生活高壓之下，大多數的赤貧　衆，眞有求死不得，謀生更難之感！在一般苦力，還可以穿了短衣，靠氣力來養家活口，惟有穿着長衣的朋友，祇會搦一技筆桿，肩不能挑，手不能提，旣無氣力可賣，而又碍於顏面，脫不下這表示斯文的長衣，平時已掙扎呻吟於生活重重高壓之下，一旦遇到疾病，伸手乞討，情所難堪，向人吿貸，恐遭白眼，處茲境地，一死百了，這無情的生活鞕子，便生生地驅策他走上自殺之途了！天下最可　而又無可吿語的，祗有這一批「隱貧」份子了！</p>
<p>陸君自殺之後，財局各同仁募捐濟助，這是値得欽佩的！但是最好進一步濟助於未然，庶可消弭這類慘劇於無形。筆者的意思：在一個團體之間，或者戚　之中，如有這樣隱貧份子，不妨事前　熱心人發起集會，如　集得二三千萬元，以之生息，不過四五個月，本息即可相等，即以一半歸還濟助人，以一半　放，按月支取息金之一部或大部，彌補生活費用之不足·這樣，受之者旣已於四五個月之後，還淸了債務，於心似可稍安，而在濟助者，也不過損失四五個月的息金，吃虧實在有限，在「爲善最樂」的信念之下，似非什麽難事。</p>
<p>如果說現在的窮人太多，未必有力助人，這話也誠然。然而財局同仁的發起文中有云「……雖然和陸濠先生一樣的窮，但是我們還是在掙扎，還能掙扎。我們應該在精神上寄以同情，在物質上予以濟助。錢，不一定多少，請各位量力爲之……」原是請大家「量力爲之」的。我們能多濟助一個人，社會就多得一分安定，名雖助人，何　助己。</p>
<h3 id="c175">乾化食品 <a href="#c175" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e175" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">175</a></h3>
<p>— 希禮</p>
<p>據專家們稱：自人類學會了把水菓等放在太陽裏曬乾以便儲藏以來，即將又有一種新式食物出現。這種新產品呌做「乾化食品」（AnhydrousFood）。被乾化了的水菓和蔬菜等者可以保留新鮮時的色·香·味以及所含的維他命。因爲它的水份完全被吸的原因，所以「班的「乾化食物」都可以被放在兩個香烟盒子這麼大的容　裏。</p>
<p>家庭裏的主婦可在買菜的吟候將維持一星期所需的蔬菜·水菓等放在她的手提包裏。譬如，一小袋米狀的乾化　薯，約有兩付撲克牌這麼大小，可供五人食用。而且，以後四時鮮菓也可不受季節的限制而我們能終年享用了，因爲「乾化食品」在普通溫度之下，無需冷藏，可保持不壞達一年之久。</p>
<p>「乾化食品」對於家庭主婦們的另一個利益即免除上市塲的麻煩。一年的食品能一次全部購回，並且儲藏在一間中等大小的儲藏室裏。烹調時間也可縮短不少。「乾化食品」不用削皮和洗濯，更沒有什麽邊皮得丟掉。因爲它在製造的時候，核·皮等已全被拿去。</p>
<p>波次愛（Clarence　Birdoeye），首先發明快冷劑的人，是這新式食品的發明者。最近他在紐約宴客的時候，將他的新貢獻發表了。許多在席的專家都以爲他對於快冷劑又有所新發現。那知他們都是被請來吃他新發明的食品的。當大家疑惑地問他怎麽弄的時候，彼次愛就和新出產該項食品的美國家庭食品公司經理羅登（H.　W.　Roden）作一個詳細的解說。</p>
<p>波次愛只用了一隻鑊子，以個平底鍋和一點兒永，費了十分鐘時間將胡蘿葡和菜花燒熟。然後再把一袋乾化的番薯倒在蒸籠上，澆過水，攪了一會兒之後，菜已燒好了。從倒口袋起一直到完成只費了四分鐘。</p>
<p>波次愛說他曾成功地乾化過菠菜，洋葱，番薯，南瓜及差不多所有的普通菜蔬和水菓。他認爲新鮮的食品沒有一樣是不能彼乾化的。</p>
<p>以前的一種去水食物者起來所需時間比新鮮食品所需的還要多。因爲它們必須放在水裏浸過一段相當長的時間，然後才能烹調，普通烹調時間爲一個半鐘點。至於新產品呢，只要四分鐘到十分鐘就够了。以前的食品去水所需時間大約十八個鐘頭。而新式的乾化器在一個半鐘頭裏就可以去掉更多的水份了。</p>
<p>「不用加高熱，並且水如此快地彼去掉，所以食物根本還來不及變更他的特性。」波次愛稱，「因爲水去得快，要它還原也快。所以在煮的時候，大部份養料和色香味都還被保存。」</p>
<p>乾化食品還有一種好處，那就是儲藏便利，所佔地方極小。九輛卡車所裝的原料經過去水之後，可以變成五車舊式的那種乾菓。如再把它乾化成本文提起的新產品話，那只要一輛車子就可以裝完了。</p>

<p>— 劉榮</p>
<p>上海爲國際化都市，　中外之覲瞻，一切市政　設，自應一以現代化爲依歸，匪擉交通水電醫藥衛生等公用事業，應使完　無慮服乏，而陶冶市民高尙情據，培養公民優美德性之處所如公園，尤應使其美化，而有城市山林之幽靜天地·庶紛紛擾　之市民，於生活奔走，爭名逐利之餘，得一涉足園林，洗却滿身塵俗，俾神智淸明，時得回復本善之人性。筆者來滬，忽忽兩年，各公園均經涉足，雖各有其風格，然於佈置經營，要亦未能盡如理想。茲就筆者居住最近，涉足最頻，知之最切，感覺最深之中正公園一論及之。</p>
<p>中正公園位於虹口，塲地廣闊，環境淸幽，惜園中佈置，十分簡陋，一覽無餘，了無園林夢趣，園中除進門之塲地上雜植草花數畦（目前即此亦付闕如），園左角有一草亭，園北角有一淞滬杭戰陣亡將士紀念碑外，此外僅半畝塘二處，其中有一清可照人，一植　藕，盛夏時猶可看水面風來，一聞荷花香氣。常此春風初動，新綠未舒，園中彌望，百卉全無，但見衰草寒蕪，引人愁緒而已，增人感嘆而已，遑論怡情，遑論養性，公園云乎哉！遊樂云乎哉！按園中春無桃李，夏無石榴蒲葵（幸有芰荷，差強人意），秋無美蓉與菊，冬無梅竹冬靑，四時之景不備，亭臺樓閣咸無。旣乏曲徑通幽之妙，亦鮮花木葱蘢之致。夏無林蔭，冬無懊廊，誠百缺而無一備，百廢而無一興。夫纍石可以邀雲，種蕉可以邀雨，蒔竹可以邀風，擊池可以逖月，栽花可以邀蝶……化平凡爲神奇，是在匠心之獨運。今園中濯濯，如美人之癩痢其頭，如西子之垢穢其體，實覺可惜！</p>
<p>近世科學發達，園藝已成爲專門學問，而花卉，造園等又爲其中之專門科目。以我國之大，及近年提倡農業，廣設農業職業等專科學校，及派送人員赴美實習，常不乏此項造園專才，何不一加延致，而此關係四百餘萬市民福利之公園，亦得以美化，豈不大佳？</p>
<p>或日：此中問題未必如此簡單，每一市政建設，必牽涉經費問題。是又不然。市預算中，旣已列有公園管理經費之項目，而其需費之比例，誠又微乎其微。今公園管理之組織如何？以及經費來源如何？筆者不得而知。但觀乎園口旣有人收門票，園中亦有人居住，是又未必全　放任者。及觀於園內之了無佈置設施，任其荒煙蔓草，似又無人負責過問。夫春種一株樹，秋時一棵花，豈非輕而易舉之事，亦須受經費限制乎？今試涉足園中，看有幾株樹。有一棵花否？余誠百思不得其解。豈眞「公共黃牯沒人　放」頭？凡事一涉「公」一涉「政」便應糟糕耶？可嘆之至！昔曾國藩光復金陵，不忘重建秦淮。而　板橋且致慨於一一片歡塲，　為茂草」。以爲千古感衰所關，見微知著，誠有可徵國運之隆替者。况此公園爲一導民以正」之地，其意義更為深長者乎！</p>
<p>春回大地，萬　昭蘇，植樹蒔茌，王其時矣。筆者有見及此，爰草是文，以促有關當局及社會人士之注意，亦以代表一部份市民之心聲。至如何建設爲一優美完備合乎理想之公園，是又專家之事，有主之者，不越俎謀焉。</p>

<p>夢，像一個神秘的使者，把日常事物的殘痕，編織成綺麗的故事，如詩一般的美麗。它常常給予人們許多奇異的想像，痛苦與歡樂。夢與藝術是最相關切的。</p>
<p>許多藝術的創作常與夢有關·在許詞中，傳秦觀的「好事的這」，即為夢中所作，元稹的「梁州夢」，陸游的「夜游宮」，劉克荘的「沁園春」等，都是為記夢而寫成的。米勒常常把日中所感觸的景象，經過晚間的冥想，第二天製出好的畫來。音樂家特第勒的　魔之曲，但是在夢中惡魔對他所彈的曲子。歌德也說在夢中可　夢到白天所　想的作品中的人物的生活。實休繪十六應真尊者像，相傳即每晚先得一夢，醒時再繪成的。（此圖在西湖聖因寺，即今西湖博物館內。）</p>

<h3 id="e1">Smooth Development of the Liaoxi Battle Situation; Bandits from Southern Liaoning Cross the Liaohe River and Flee North to Gather; Siping Airfield Attacked and Repelled <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>[Our Shenyang Dispatch, 5th] Although Siping is tense, apart from the airfield five kilometers west of Siping, which was attacked by bandits on the evening of the 3rd and repelled by the National Army, there have been no major engagements. Furthermore, bandits in the Shenyang-Benxi area have not launched a direct offensive.</p>
<p>[Our Shenyang Dispatch, 5th] Most of the bandits from Southern Liaoning have crossed the Liaohe River and moved north. Currently, only the 4th Column of bandits and other units are between Benxi and Yingkou in Southern Liaoning, while the 9th Column is in the area south of Xinmin. The remaining columns, including the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 6th, 7th, and 8th Columns, have all reached Northern Liaoning. The bandits' northward movement, in addition to attempting to attack Siping and Jilin-Changchun and to reorganize and replenish their forces, may have other political motives. It is also rumored that over a hundred Soviet military advisors have arrived in Harbin from Boliy. It is further rumored that Lin Biao has decided to enlist several divisions of youths aged fifteen and above for training in Northern Songjiang, hoping to occupy Jilin-Changchun as soon as possible and establish a new military and political center.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Shenyang, 5th] The Liaoxi battle situation is developing favorably. A certain elite corps of the National Army is currently advancing towards the designated area with irresistible force. There are no longer any bandits entrenched in the Xinlitun area, and most of them fled towards Faku on the evening of the 3rd. Our Air Force conducted frequent sorties on the 4th, bombing and strafing extensively around Yingkou, Liaoyuan, and Siping, with significant gains. Furthermore, there have been minor engagements in the Siping area. Over a thousand remnants of the bandits, starting from near Bamiancheng on the night of the 3rd, infiltrated the area west and north of the Siping airfield, but were repelled by the defending troops.</p>
<p>[Joint Press, Beiping, 5th] According to a telegram from the Northeast, the National Army is about to open up a corridor directly to Shenyang. Reinforcements are advancing along the Ping-Shenyang Road from Liaobei, now only a few miles from Xinmin. Once Xinmin is relieved, land transportation from North China to Shenyang can be restored, although repairing the destroyed railway may take several weeks. The Communist bandits previously operating on the Shenyang-Yushu section of the railway have withdrawn to the north of Shenyang, likely due to heavy losses and to avoid being surrounded after the Liaohe River thaws. This shows that the Communist army does not have sufficient strength to capture Shenyang and continues to maintain its consistent policy of avoiding large-scale direct combat.</p>
<p>[Our Shenyang Dispatch, 5th] A qualified source analyzed the Northeast war situation, stating that the recent northward movement of the bandits' main forces, resulting in a shrinking state, is clearly due to the pressure from the National Army entering the region. From a political perspective, this is the result of the entire nation paying close attention to the Northeast. It is undoubtedly necessary for the Northeast theater to have national support. Although the threat to Shenyang has been lifted, the future remains challenging and dangerous. The bandits' seventh offensive can be said to have come to an end, and their losses have been extremely heavy. The current shrinking is a period of reorganization and replenishment, and it is difficult to conclude that they are at the end of their rope. Their next move deserves close attention. The rapid growth of the Communist bandits in the Northeast has both internal and external factors, and their abundant supplies are a fact that cannot be ignored. Although the Northeast war situation is gradually becoming clearer, the shadows have not disappeared. The bandits' shrinking may be a delaying tactic, and the nation's vigilance should not be diverted.</p>
<p>[Our Beiping Dispatch, 5th] Luo Zhuoying, Li Zongren, and Fu Zuoyi discussed the military situation in the Northeast in Beiping and have reached a substantial agreement. Luo is scheduled to fly to Shenyang on the 6th to report back.</p>

<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 5th] Regarding the issue of reforming the Northeast currency system, after negotiations between the Northeast representatives and the petition delegation and the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Finance has agreed in principle to the reform. However, technical issues still need to be discussed with the Central Bank. Dai Mingli, the Director of the Currency Department, left for Shanghai by train on the night of the 5th to discuss the technical issues of the Northeast currency system reform with Zhang Jia'ao. The Ministry of Finance hopes that a solution can be reached within the next week.</p>

<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 5th] Northeast elders Zhang Zuoxiang, Ma Zhanshan, and Wan Fulin left Nanjing by train on the night of the 5th for Shanghai, accompanied by Mo Dehui. Zhang and others will make a brief stop in Shanghai before returning to Beiping. Before leaving, Ma and Zhang met with reporters, answering several inquiries. Zhang and others first stated that the achievements of this trip include: first, the Chairman's assurance that the Central Government will never abandon the Northeast under any circumstances, indicating the Central Government's determination and methods; and second, the issue of organizing local armed forces. They will wait for orders after returning to the North before proceeding with the organization, as the Central Government has no concrete plans. When asked whether they specifically requested Ambassador Stuart to convey the Northeast issue to the U.S. government and seek assistance during their meeting with the Ambassador, they replied that they had not yet, but the Ambassador expressed great concern about the matter. Zhang and others then stated that there are still several unresolved issues that the Northeast petition delegation will continue to negotiate with all parties. They seek only to find opportunities to serve the cause of national salvation and rural revitalization and have no other personal ambitions. (The written statement of Zhang Zuoxiang and others, as well as news of the welcome of Zhang and others by Northeast groups and the Beijing Municipal Council, are published on page two.)</p>

<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 5th] The Northeast petition delegation, led by Wang Huayi, has been running around in Nanjing, appealing to all parties for four things: sending reinforcements, transporting military supplies, reforming the currency system, and organizing local armed forces. The first two have yielded relatively satisfactory results. Regarding reinforcements, the Chairman has personally promised to allocate troops and has already sought to implement it. Regarding military supplies, the Ministry of Food has replied that 960,000 large bags of grain should be allocated by the end of April of this year, and all have been allocated and shipped. In the future, 120,000 large bags will be allocated monthly without delay, so the new military supply problem has been completely resolved. As for civilian food, the Ministry of Food is also planning separately. Secondly, regarding the issue of circulating currency, Vice President Wang Chonghui promised at a banquet for the petition delegation on the afternoon of the 5th to immediately summon Zhang Jia'ao, the President of the National Bank, to Nanjing to discuss the reform issue, so a considerable solution can also be obtained. As for organizing local armed forces, it still awaits instructions from the Central Government.

On the other hand, California Democratic Congresswoman Douglas said: "I personally agree to continue to follow Marshall's guidance. I believe that Marshall has a central mind and a whole plan, and his handling of the issue of aid to the world must be whole, not piecemeal."

<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 5th] The Legislative Yuan's Finance and Economics Committees held a joint meeting on the morning of the 5th.

On the one hand, to inspire the conscience of the rich, imitate the patriotic spirit of the British during the war, and voluntarily declare their deposits for national use; on the other hand, to make friendly countries understand the position of our people's organizations on the issue of utilizing deposits, and to understand our country's financial situation and assist in this matter within the legal scope. The committee members present agreed with this and spoke up one after another, deciding that Liu and Jian would organize the opinions of the meeting, draft a recommendation, submit it to the next meeting of the Legislative Yuan for discussion and approval, and then submit it to the National Government to order the Executive Yuan to draft effective measures and send them to the Legislative Yuan for review. At the same time, they will continue to intensify negotiations with the United Kingdom and the United States to obtain their agreement and assistance.</p>

<p>[Our Guangzhou Dispatch, 5th] Since the implementation of the anti-smuggling part of the Sino-Hong Kong Customs and Financial Agreement, other parts related to preventing smuggling and handling remittances have not yet been implemented.

Therefore, the date for the full formal signing of the agreement will be postponed again. Since the signing of the agreement, smuggling in South China has not been curbed. We have again proposed two measures to the UK and requested acceptance: (1) Hong Kong should obtain our consent for the issuance of export licenses for goods entering our country; (2) goods exported by us without government approval should be confiscated by Hong Kong. As for the issue of remittance transfers, the UK has expressed difficulties in cooperating due to the location of interests. According to Hong Kong sources, the official has now formally announced that the Sino-Hong Kong agreement does not include any attachments other than the anti-smuggling item. It also stated that the two sides have not yet discussed other agreements.</p>

<h3 id="e19">This Year's Trade Plan; The Ministry of Economic Affairs Formulates Principles; Divided Into Two Major Departments: Foreign Exchange and Trade Management; Proposes Partial Amendments to the Current Exchange Settlement Methods <a href="#e19" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c19" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">19</a></h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 5th] The principles and policies for my country's import and export trade plan for the 37th year have been formulated after detailed research by the Ministry of Economic Affairs. Detailed implementation methods are currently being studied and supplemented, and will be submitted to the Executive Yuan for approval once finalized. It is reported that the new plan has proposed partial amendments to the current exchange settlement methods and advocates implementing new exchange settlement methods. The main part of the new plan can be divided into two major departments: foreign exchange and trade management. The main points are as follows:</p>
<p>(A) Foreign Exchange Part: (1) Implement new exchange settlement methods. In the past, all exported materials were settled with the Central Bank. The new plan proposes that, for exported materials that are optimistic about the international market, such as bristles, tung oil, and tea, a maximum of one-third should be settled with the Central Bank. According to estimates in the plan, last year's total exports were about one billion U.S. dollars. If new exchange settlement methods are implemented, this year's exports can reach 200 to 300 million U.S. dollars. If one-third is settled with the Central Bank, the government can obtain about 90 million U.S. dollars annually. In addition, the export estimates of state-owned enterprises can also obtain 90.1 million U.S. dollars. This year, the government can control 180 million U.S. dollars in export-related foreign exchange. (2) The principle of adjusting the foreign exchange reserve should take into account the inflation rate of export materials and the parity of the legal tender's purchasing power abroad. If adjustments are made according to the above principles, the black market can be eliminated and remittances can also be increased. It is estimated that this year can reach about 120 million U.S. dollars. Combined with the 180 million U.S. dollars in export-related foreign exchange, the government can control about 300 million U.S. dollars for construction purposes. (3) The export foreign exchange obtained by exporters, in addition to those settled with the Central Bank, must be used for imports. The method is not specified, and they can import on their own or sell to importers, but it must be completed within six months, and the government is responsible for supervising it. The government should register the foreign exchange obtained from exports for assessment. (4) The government will not provide foreign exchange for imports. The foreign exchange needed by importers can be obtained from export foreign exchange obtained by exporters, remittances, foreign investment, and the assets and deposits of Chinese citizens abroad.</p>
<p>(B) Trade Management Part: (1) Export adopts a free trade policy, and the government does not interfere. (2) Import adopts a controlled policy, stipulating that luxury goods and the like are prohibited from import. In order to protect domestic industry, the import of certain goods may be restricted. The goods subject to import restrictions are temporarily determined according to the situation. Machinery, raw materials, and building materials can be freely imported. (3) Cancel the permit method and simplify import and export procedures.</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3 id="e30">Opposing the Strike's Non-Compensation Plan <a href="#e30" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c30" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">30</a></h3>
<p>The American "Foreign Affairs Advisory Association" released a report by 175 members on the 1st of this month, advising the Department of the Army not to remove non-purely war-related industries from Japan for compensation. The drafter of this report was Strike, who advocated anti-reparations. Therefore, the presentation of the Strike Report can be regarded as the presentation of the American anti-reparations plan. China, the Philippines, and Canada are the countries most threatened by Japanese aggression and most eager for Japanese compensation. Naturally, they are also most concerned about the proposal of this anti-compensation plan. The authorities of the ten Far Eastern countries have not yet made a clear statement on the American "trial balloon", and will probably reserve it until the Far Eastern Commission meeting before formally expressing their attitude. However, according to the Associated Press, at least four or five of the eleven Far Eastern countries will express their opposition, including China and the Philippines, as well as New Zealand, the Commonwealth of Australia, and India. Only defeated Japan reported with joy after the publication of the Strike Report. They thanked Strike for his broad-mindedness and hoped that this plan would be established as soon as possible, allowing Japan to win a victory in defeat.</p>
<p>According to reports, Strike is the chairman of the American McGraw Company and also an advisor on compensation issues to the Department of the Army. After the Pauley Plan was passed by the Far Eastern Commission, the Department of the Army and MacArthur Headquarters believed that the amount of compensation claimed from Japan by the Pauley Plan was too "strict". The Department of the Army then ordered Strike to go to Japan to serve as chairman of the Special Committee on Compensation, representing the Army to investigate the situation in Japan, and preparing to draft a "lenient" compensation plan. In January of last year, Strike drafted a proposal, which was said to be only about 30% of Pauley's plan, and the details were never published. General MacArthur believed that both the Pauley Plan and the Strike Plan were difficult to implement, so the Allied Headquarters drafted another plan for the Army Department to refer to. The MacArthur Plan completely ignored the political significance of compensation. In order to reconcile the above plans, the Department of the Army re-determined the amount of compensation to be claimed from Japan, and again ordered Strike to be responsible for drafting a "lenient" plan. In July of last year, Strike, in his capacity as the head of the "Foreign Affairs Advisory Association," led a team of technical experts to Tokyo to study Japanese issues, and once came to to search for reference materials, completing the on-site investigation in December and returning home. Before going to Japan for investigation, Strike wrote an article for "America Magazine" entitled "Revenge is Waste," advocating overturning Pauley's compensation plan, canceling the resolution passed by the Far Eastern Commission in May 1946, and re-establishing a relatively high level of Japanese industry so that she could stand up in the world. Based on this high level, Japan should not pay compensation, so that the United States could reduce its burden. His conclusion stated: "The United States must immediately find a way to cancel the Far Eastern Commission's recommendations because it cannot make Japan self-sufficient." Based on this erroneous anti-compensation theory and the results of his investigation in Japan, this newspaper published an editorial in September of last year to refute it. However, Strike continued to do his own thing, and on the 1st of this month, he published this new plan. He strongly advocated retaining Japanese industry, believing that removing all Japanese industrial equipment other than basic war industrial equipment would hinder world production and reduce Japan's possibility of achieving self-sufficiency.</p>
<p>The "Strike Report" has not yet been submitted to the Far Eastern Commission for publication, which is obviously an American "official probe" to understand the opinions of the other ten Far Eastern countries. However, we believe that the "Strike Report" is not a "compensation plan" but a political plan to support Japan's revival. If this plan is allowed to develop, not only will Japan's wartime economy recover immediately, but also the resolutions of the Far Eastern Commission and the terms of the Potsdam Declaration will immediately become waste paper. Under any circumstances, we must express our opposition. Now we further state the reasons for our opposition:</p>
<p>First, we that the Potsdam Declaration must obtain compensation. According to international law and precedent, compensation is the duty of the defeated countries, and the victorious countries' claim for compensation is a right. Our China has suffered the longest from Japanese aggression, and public and private property and materials have been destroyed and removed. We must obtain compensation and restitution. We hope that the peace conference with Japan will be convened as soon as possible in order to obtain compensation and rapidly develop China's industry. At the same time, on the other hand, we can prevent the resurgence of Japanese aggression. In short, whether China can obtain Japanese compensation is a major issue concerning China's centuries of fate. We against non-compensation, oppose Japan's high level of industry, and against the conspiracy of "Japanese industry and Chinese agriculture". The Potsdam Declaration clearly stipulates that: "Japan shall be allowed to maintain such industries as will sustain her economy and permit the exaction of just reparations in kind, but not those which would enable her to rearm for war." In other words, all industries that are not necessary to maintain the lives of the Japanese people and pay for reparations in kind, especially military industries, should be dismantled and used for compensation. The "Strike Report" suggests retaining about two-thirds of Japanese pig iron, steel plates, steel bars, sulfuric acid, merchant ships, etc., using about one-third for compensation, and retaining all textile industry and other heavy industrial machinery and tools. Obviously, it completely retains Japan's military industry and does not dismantle war industrial equipment, which violates the spirit of the Potsdam Declaration.</p>
<p>First, we must put forward our own views and ask the Far Eastern countries to agree that the consistent view of our country is that Japan's revival will inevitably threaten China's security. Strike's plan is clearly aimed at promoting Japan's accelerated revival, so the government attaches great importance to this. It has also revised the table of restrictions on Japanese industrial levels. According to the decision of the Executive Yuan's Political Affairs Conference: all aviation and military industries should be completely destroyed, and railways and heavy industries should be gradually reduced; in the textile industry, it should be reduced to a considerable amount. In order to prevent Japan's resurgence from engaging in aggression, the criteria determined by our government are both necessary and reasonable; it should argue reasonably with the Far Eastern Commission, and will not stop until the goal is achieved. Fortunately, Strike's plan has not yet been approved by the Far Eastern Commission. At this time, our country can use its diplomacy properly, and the country's views will surely be adopted by the Far Eastern Commission.</p>
<p>Third, we that the Far Eastern Commission's decision is the general preliminary plan for Japan announced by the United States in October 1945, and Japan should have the obligation to pay compensation and return looted goods. In April 1946, Pauley, the compensation commissioner representing the US President, suggested reducing Japan's peacetime industrial capacity by 30%, with the aim of preventing Japan from launching another war and making the Japanese people understand that they are the defeated country and should be punished. The Pauley Plan was passed by the Far Eastern Commission in May 1946, and the United States also expressed its agreement. For a year, the Far Eastern Commission has been trying to implement this plan, and has designated 1,100 factories to be dismantled for compensation in countries such as China and the Philippines. On June 20, 1947, the Far Eastern Commission announced the basic policies for Japan, which are regarded as the basis and principles for the future conclusion of the Japanese peace treaty, and further defined clear concepts for Japanese industrial levels and compensation. Our China is one of the important member states of the Far Eastern Commission, and should respect the organization and resolutions of the Far Eastern Commission. The content of the Pauley Plan is indeed too "strict" in the eyes of the US military, but according to our research, it does have a suspicion of being "big". In order to respect the spirit of the Far Eastern Commission's resolution, we did not reject the passage of the Pauley Plan. The US Department of the Army's confidence in the Pauley Plan has obviously wavered. 'Strike Report' not only wants to reject the Pauley Plan, but also wants to change the original view, cancel all resolutions of the Far Eastern Commission, and even abandon the punitive position determined by the Potsdam Agreement, and adopt a positive position to support Japan's revival, regardless of the future peace treaty with Japan. In any case, we cannot agree</p>
<p>In short, the anti-compensation theory of the "Strike Report" and the attempt to oppose all resolutions passed by the Far Eastern Commission are completely unreasonable. We hope that the wise American government authorities can consider the explosiveness of the "Strike anti-compensation theory", make a decisive decision, and immediately maintain the original view. At the same time, we also hope that the American authorities will quickly break the deadlock in the Japanese peace conference so that the Japanese compensation issue and the industrial level issue can be resolved rationally as soon as possible!</p>

<p>[Our reporter in Nanjing on the 5th] The East Xinjiang People's Representative Group, including Dr. Yao Le and ten others, went to the National Government to visit Chairman Jiang to pay their respects and present a flag at 11 a.m. on the 5th. The Chairman received them and inquired in detail about the political and economic situation and the situation of various ethnic groups in East Xinjiang. The representatives then presented a flag embroidered with the four characters "Leader of China". A photo was taken as a souvenir before they left. The group also presented a flag to Madame Chiang Kai-shek with the words "Light of Women," which was entrusted to the Chairman's staff for delivery.</p>
<h3 id="e32">Zhang Zuoxiang and Others' Written Statement <a href="#e32" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c32" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">32</a></h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 5th] Zhang Zuoxiang, Ma Zhanshan, Wan Fulin, and others issued a written statement before leaving Beijing for Shanghai. The original text is as follows. When Liaoyang fell, Anshan was besieged, and Shenyang was in danger, Zuoxiang and others were urgently summoned by the central government. Since arriving in Beijing via Shanghai, compatriots in Beijing and Shanghai and public opinion circles have unanimously believed that the Northeast is important, that without the Northeast there is no North China, and without North China there is no country. The safety and survival of the country depend on ensuring the Northeast as the key. Not only has the past mistaken understanding of "the Northeast is the Northeast of the Northeasterners" been eliminated, but the goal has been concentrated, and everyone has risen up to appeal, which has indeed added to our infinite inspiration and belief.</p>
<p>During the eleven days in Beijing, we successively visited military and political leaders such as Chief of Staff Chen, President Zhang, and Minister Bai, as well as people from all walks of life. We also had a discussion with Ambassador Stuart, and we have presented our opinions on saving the Northeast crisis separately, which has been highly valued. Recently, we visited Chairman Jiang, who personally instructed that "the government is determined to ensure the Northeast, and will immediately send a large army to reinforce it, reverse the battle situation, and the established policy towards the Northeast will be thoroughly implemented to the end. The central government has the determination, methods, and confidence to protect the Northeast." After listening to this, we deeply admire and appreciate the head of state's long-term vision and decision-making. We believe that bringing this news and impression back to the Northeast and conveying it to the military and civilians who are suffering will surely further encourage their emotions in support of the central government and inspire their spirit of fighting for the country, thereby expanding the results of their bandit suppression. Since Zuoxiang and others came at the call of the government, and now that we have fulfilled our task of being interviewed, we should return north. On the occasion of parting, we would like to say to our compatriots and government officials in Beijing and Shanghai that although the current political and military situation is slightly serious, with the existing vast human, financial, and material resources, if they can be properly organized and used, under the wise leadership of the Chairman, we will surely achieve the final victory in suppressing the rebellion and building the country. In order to win, it is important to win over the hearts of the people, boost morale, strengthen the organization and training of the people, reuse officers in the countryside, develop local armed forces, cooperate with the national army in combat, and fully exert the political and popular strength that has been neglected in the past. Zuoxiang and others are getting old and have no other desires than to save the country and their hometown. We hope that our sincere intentions will be understood. As for the emergency measures to save the Northeast, and all the issues in the implementation of political, economic, and other important reforms in the future, we believe that the representatives of the Northeast Petition Group can continue to petition the government based on the wishes of the Northeast compatriots and the guidance and encouragement of the people of Beijing and Shanghai, and will surely achieve the two major goals of stabilizing the Northeast and consolidating North China, and achieve satisfactory results.</p>
<h3 id="e33">Northeast Groups in Beijing Welcome Zhang Zuoxiang and Others <a href="#e33" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c33" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">33</a></h3>
<p>Two Proposals Passed on the Spot</p>
<p>[Our reporter in Nanjing on the 5th] Northeast elders and the Northeast Petition Group were invited by relevant Northeast groups in Beijing to attend a welcome meeting at 2 p.m. on the 5th. The meeting was presided over by Lu Zhonglin, who emphasized that our solution to the Northeast problem cannot be achieved by shouting slogans. The Northeast is not a question of whether it can be lost or not, but a question of whether it can be lost. What we should discuss today is how to prevent it from being lost. Then Zhang Zuoxiang delivered a speech, saying that he came to Beijing at the invitation of Chief of Staff Chen to prepare for inquiries, and at the same time visited Chairman Jiang to report on the Northeast issue. He believed that the main reason for the failure to make full use of human and material resources was that there should be corrections in the future. Then Wang Huaichi delivered a speech. Wang first explained the significance of this visit in two points: (1) To show that the people of the Northeast and the people of North China are sincerely supporting the central government; (2) The representatives who came to Beijing this time came from various places, both old and young, but their wishes are the same. If the central government is prepared to recover the Northeast, they will do their best and vow to be the backing. Secondly, Wang reviewed the situation in the Northeast in several points: (1) In terms of military affairs, it is undeniable that it has already failed. The number of communist bandits is increasing, which is caused by our strategic mistakes, and we only know how to defend certain strongholds to the death, so that after the strongholds fall, the troops are also lost; (2) In the past, we did not know how to use local armed forces, and we only knew how to use soldiers but did not know how to use the people, which led to the current mistakes; (3) Discord in personnel, disharmony between officers and soldiers, which led to the current situation; (4) The issue of currency in circulation needs to be resolved, because this matter is related to the overall situation and needs to be resolved urgently. Then two proposals were passed: (1) In order to support the government in completing the great plan to suppress the rebellion, this meeting will call on compatriots in the 29 provinces, cities, and districts of the North to support the petition of the Northeast representatives and the eight urgent appeals of the Northeast Beijing Fellow Villagers Association on the 29th of last month, and jointly urge the government to accept them all, implement them immediately, and vow to be the backing of the government and the Northeast in order to rescue the Northeast and stabilize North China. (2) Please ask the conference to send a telegram to the US President and the Senate and House of Representatives to speed up military aid to China.</p>
<p>Beijing Municipal Council Tea Party Reception</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 5th] The Municipal Council held a tea party to entertain the elders from the Northeast and the people's representatives from the nine provinces and three cities who came to Beijing. It was held at the Gongyu Lianhuan Society at 10 a.m. on the 5th. Speaker Chen Yuguang presided over the meeting and delivered a welcome speech, emphasizing that the Northeast people's representatives came to Beijing to petition not only for the Northeast, but also for the whole country. The Northeast issue is one of the issues of the whole of China and even the whole world. If the Northeast issue is resolved, the issues of the whole country and the whole world can be resolved at the same time.</p>

If this is not quickly adjusted, the impact on the national economy and people's livelihood will be significant. It has recently telegraphed all counties, ordering them to instruct grain merchants to purchase grain from producing areas, expand grain sources, and replenish reserves, ensuring that they control at least three months' worth of local grain needs to meet demand.</p>

<h3 id="e58">Wedemeyer Praises President Chiang Expresses Opinions on Aid to China in the House Foreign Affairs Committee <a href="#e58" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c58" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">58</a></h3>
<p>[US News Service, Washington, 4th] Lieutenant General Wedemeyer, who served as the commander of US forces in China during the war, told the House Foreign Affairs Committee on the 4th that he recommended that military assistance be included in the $570 million economic aid plan for China. Wedemeyer specifically stated that the so-called military assistance did not mean military participation in resisting the Communist Chinese army. He proposed that appropriate technical guidance be given on the use of the supplied weapons.</p>
<p>Wedemeyer believes that in national policy, he holds sincere disagreements with Marshall's opinion. However, he expressed the highest respect for the Secretary of State's loyalty, [space] and ability. He stated, "Unless we protect the assistance we provide, I believe we should help other countries in cultural, economic and political warfare."</p>
<p>When answering a question, Wedemeyer stated, "I believe we should provide military assistance to all nations in the world who believe in our way of life and are willing to remain free. I believe we should provide military assistance to China."</p>
<p>Someone asked if it would be more appropriate to expand economic assistance at present, and then expand military assistance when China has obtained opportunities for self-help and when necessary? Wedemeyer replied, "If it were two years ago, I would think your proposal was perfect, but today I think it is too late."</p>
<p>General Wedemeyer stated that the Communist Party army poured into the Northeast and [space] National Headquarters from the north at such a rate and strength that "mere money" could not stop it in that area or any area. He also criticized the erroneous view that [space] the Chinese Communist Party is merely a peasant who wants to escape the oppression of the autocratic [space] government. He is convinced that the Chinese Communist Party is working for international communism [space].</p>
<p>Wedemeyer explained to the Foreign Affairs Committee that due to the confidential nature of the reports he [space] submitted to the General Staff regarding the situation in China and Korea, he felt [space] it was somewhat difficult to testify. He said that for security reasons, he also had to be careful when answering [space] questions, because he was the Director of the War Planning Department and might have confidential information on these issues.</p>
<p>When asked whether he thought the threat to the United States was greater from China [space] or from Europe, Wedemeyer asked the committee to forgive him for being unable to answer [space], because people in other fields would be interested in the answer to this question. The Foreign Affairs Committee agreed to Wedemeyer's request and decided to hold an executive session so that Wedemeyer could give a more complete answer. However, in the segment where he was granted temporary non-response, Wedemeyer praised President Chiang's personality and the progress made by the Chinese government in terms of reform.</p>
<p>Wedemeyer praised President Chiang: "I know President Chiang very well. Dunnan (former political advisor to the President) may know him even [space] better, but Dunnan is dead. I have been with the President for two years, and I have the highest respect and admiration for him. He is an absolutely honest and upright man."</p>
<p>Wedemeyer denied that during the last war, large amounts of American military supplies had been diverted by corrupt leaders of the Nationalist government for other purposes. He said that when he was patrolling in China, almost all of the American supplies that flew over India reached [space] the hands of the Nationalist army.</p>
<p>One committee member asked whether he trusted China's promises, [space] [space] [space] said that he knew President Chiang's absolute integrity and [space] truth, and that in his past dealings with the President, he had never encountered "Oriental [space] opportunity."</p>
<p>He [space] believed that the Chinese could fulfill all their agreements. He also said that the Chinese government is now trying to move forward in the direction that the United States wants and [space] to establish new joint administrations.</p>
<p>Wedemeyer continued: "Foreigners who have lived in China for a long time have told me that they are amazed at the progress that President Chiang has made." However, Wedemeyer expressed doubts about whether the Chinese government could defeat the Communist Party. When asked what kind of action would be needed to help China defeat the Communist Party, Wedemeyer hesitated for a moment, and then replied that he could not provide a "listening-sensitive answer," saying that this matter should be guided by the State Department.</p>
<p>He explained: "Since my last visit to China, the Chinese situation has deteriorated so rapidly that I cannot answer at this moment. A new investigation must be conducted to determine how much assistance is needed."</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 4th] When Wedemeyer expressed his views on the Aid to China Act in the House Foreign Affairs Committee, he praised President Chiang, saying: "When I took office as the Commander of the US Military Region in China, I did not intend to trust President Chiang, but [space] when I was in office, I admired him very much; Mr. Chiang cares about the people and is not arrogant, and is willing to sacrifice himself. Japan once seemed to be on the verge of defeating China. I asked President Chiang to [space] organize new troops [space] troops, and the Chiang army accepted without hesitation, and the situation [space] was saved." Republican Congressman Chow Yide also told Wedemeyer: "As far as I know, Marshall did not oppose military aid to China, but only did not want to include this aid in the bill currently being discussed by Congress." After Wedemeyer finished his speech, the House Foreign Affairs Committee held a closed-door meeting. (Note: The main points of Wedemeyer's testimony have been seen in yesterday's first edition.)</p>

<h3 id="e59">The Five-Nation Conference in The Hague Plans to Draft a Fifty-Year Mutual Defense Treaty A General Agreement is Expected to be Reached Tomorrow <a href="#e59" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c59" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">59</a></h3>
<p>[This newspaper's report] London, 5th, broadcast: Brussels report, the five-nation conference discussing the Western European Union was temporarily adjourned today because Britain's second representative, Jeb, and the French Foreign Ministry Secretary-General, Zhuo Faner, were delayed by heavy fog in the North Sea after returning to their countries for instructions, preventing them from arriving on time. It is expected that the conference will reach a general understanding on Sunday.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Brussels, 4th, Associated Press] Representatives from five countries, Britain, France, the Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg, have begun meeting in an urgent atmosphere to draft a long-term economic, cultural, and military treaty. This meeting is expected to lay the foundation for the rapid establishment of the Western European Union by democratic countries and to pave the way for future meetings of the sixteen countries participating in the Marshall Plan. This extremely secret meeting is being held outside the Belgian capital, and journalists are not allowed to enter the venue. However, after the 90-minute meeting, a communiqué was issued stating that the five countries had extremely similar opinions. British and Belgian sources said that the proposed treaty would include military clauses stipulating that unified action would be taken against acts of aggression from any direction. The treaty would last for 50 years and is officially referred to as an economic, social, and cultural treaty. The British Foreign Minister said that this treaty is the foundation for establishing a solid and much-needed organization. It is also learned that the military clauses will include a guarantee of military assistance if Western Europe is attacked. There is no indication that the governments have formally exchanged documents. Well-informed sources said that the exchange could only take place after the Western European Union had been formally established.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Brussels, 4th] People close to the five-nation delegation said that the Western European Union Convention is expected to be drafted quickly. The preliminary talks of the five powers that began in Brussels on the 4th could end by this Saturday or at the latest by Sunday. The foreign ministers of the five countries could meet before the meeting of the sixteen European countries discussing the Marshall Plan in Paris on March 15 to conclude the drafting of the Western European Union Convention and complete the signing procedures. According to reliable sources, the preliminary meeting in Brussels does not intend to discuss the military issues of the Western European Union's Five-Nation Convention. This point will be discussed after British Imperial Chief of Staff Marshal Montgomery visits Belgium at the end of this month to inspect Belgian military equipment. It is also learned that the British and French representatives will present new proposals for the Western European Union, which were recently produced after an exchange of views between Britain and France, for the study of the Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg at the meeting on the 5th. The draft convention proposed by the Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg is said to have obtained a general agreement from the representatives. The Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg advocate the conclusion of a close regional agreement between the five countries. Although the United Nations Charter already has provisions for regional agreements, this five-nation convention should include provisions for mutual assistance and the peaceful resolution of any possible disagreements between the signatory countries."</p>
<h3 id="e60">The United States Supports the Western European Union May Provide a Guarantee of Military Assistance <a href="#e60" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c60" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">60</a></h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 4th] Observers here believe that the early signing of the Western European Five-Nation Convention can prove that Washington has already expressed its readiness to support the Western European Union with the necessary military backing. Most people believe that the United States and Britain, France, the Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg have reached an understanding on the security aspects of the Western European Union. Judging from the statement made by US Deputy Secretary of State Lovett yesterday, this speculation can be proven to be correct.</p>
<p>Lovett said that a guarantee from the United States against aggression against the countries of the Marshall Plan could replace the forty-year anti-German aggression convention previously proposed by the United States. Although Lovett also stated that the United States' guarantee would not be realized until some form of Western European Union already existed, there is no doubt that the United States will encourage the early establishment of this alliance. It has recently been learned that among the sixteen Western European countries, in addition to Britain and France, at least Italy, the Netherlands, Turkey, and three Nordic countries will send their foreign ministers to Paris to discuss the possibility of expanding the Western European Union with Britain and France. Britain's participation in the military responsibilities of the Western European Union is also of direct interest to other countries of the British Commonwealth. It is expected here that if Britain accepts military obligations under the Western European Union, other countries of the British Commonwealth may only be willing to establish appropriate military ties with the Western European Union, rather than directly accepting formal military obligations.</p>

<p>[Central News Agency, Ankara, 4th] Relations between Turkey and the Soviet satellite states of Eastern Europe have deteriorated. Bulgaria, under the control of the Communist Party, celebrated the "70th Anniversary of Liberation from Turkish Shackles" yesterday. Most of the speeches and newspaper headlines denounced Turkey, and the articles contained pro-Soviet sentiment.

<p>[Central News Agency, Helsinki, 4th] According to observers here, after correcting an error in the translation of Stalin's letter, Finland can avoid concluding a military agreement with the Soviet Union. The error was discovered in the translation of a private letter from Stalin to President Paasikivi.

<p>[New Asia, Tokyo, 5th] Japanese Prime Minister Ashida visited Socialist Party Chairman Katayama on the morning of the 5th and earnestly requested him to join the cabinet three times. However, Katayama still replied that he had no intention of joining the cabinet, but could consult with the central organs of the Socialist Party before making a decision. At 4:00 PM, the Socialist Party Central Executive Committee held a meeting, at which Katayama first reported on Prime Minister Ashida's three requests for him to join the cabinet. At the time, except for one committee member who said, "Since the party has supported the Ashida cabinet, it is natural for the party leader to join the cabinet," all other committee members expressed opposition. As a result, it was decided that Katayama would not join the cabinet.</p>
<p>After the meeting, Socialist Party Secretary-General Asanuma visited Takeda at the cabinet formation headquarters to convey the Socialist Party's decision and hoped that the Ashida cabinet's formation work could proceed, treating the Katayama issue separately. Takeda replied that he would respond early on the 6th. As a result, the Ashida cabinet wasted another day because of Katayama's cabinet participation issue, and cabinet formation work will be difficult to complete this week. Furthermore, Socialist Party Chairman Katayama issued a statement after meeting with Democratic Party President Ashida on the 5th, saying, "Although President Ashida has repeatedly requested me to join the cabinet, I believe that it is better to unite the party and cooperate with the new cabinet. I have fully considered the country's problems and believe that it is extremely important to strengthen the party, which is the foundation of progressive policies. Therefore, I have declined to join the cabinet so far. As for whether the cabinet will collapse because I do not join, I do not know. I believe that the responsibility for forming a cabinet lies with the person who is appointed, not with the Socialist Party." Prime Minister Ashida also issued a statement after meeting with Katayama, saying, "The Ashida cabinet's first condition is Katayama's participation. If this cannot be decided, then I am determined not to convene a meeting of the three party leaders or to deliberate on cabinet appointments.

<p>Chinese Observers Express Deep Indignation</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 5th] Today, the defense counsel for Japanese war criminals made extensive propaganda in their defense brief before the military tribunal regarding the Manchurian Incident stage of the Pacific War. They even argued that the motives for the war against China were very legitimate, citing the Lytton Report as cover. The wording used in the defense brief was extremely offensive to China, and all Chinese observers were extremely indignant. This afternoon, the military tribunal ordered the defense counsel to stop their statements and ordered them to revise the document containing pre-war Japanese anti-China propaganda. Only when the "offensive words" are removed from the document will the defense's statements regarding the China stage be allowed to continue.</p>

<p>— Translated by Our Editorial Department</p>
<p>Praying for Lasting Peace to Descend Upon Mankind</p>
<p>In my seventy-five years of life, I have seen this country grow from a continental power to a world power, with interests in every corner of the globe.</p>
<p>We are powerful today in terms of military strength, and also in terms of peace and humanitarianism. But with our vast power comes a great responsibility. The greatest of these responsibilities is to lead the nations on the path of cooperation for peace, justice, freedom, and progress.</p>
<p>In the past, there was a common view, supported by tradition, that the United States had nothing to fear and that its future was assured. Our vast resources and organizational abilities guaranteed our destiny, and our system would endure forever. There is no belief more dangerous than this.</p>
<p>In fact, we have reached a time when we should stand still, watch, and listen. We should analyze ourselves and our place in the world with sharp introspection.</p>
<p>Are the people of this generation truly better off than their predecessors in previous generations? Science and invention have given them more things to enjoy; in this respect, they are indeed much better off than people in the past. They have all kinds of good things to eat and good things to wear, and good entertainment. Compared with the limited life enjoyment of the past, they are indeed much happier. But in some other respects, the situation is worse. They lack extensive education, lack enthusiasm for freedom and the rule of law, and fail to maintain a keen interest and vigilance in the conduct of public affairs.</p>
<p>In my opinion, organized society has declined in the past generation.</p>
<p>We have seen a marked decline in the entire international political organization, and the entire international economic organization is threatened with destruction. In political and economic affairs, mankind has suffered a gradual decline. It is useless for us to sing the praises of scientific and technological progress to hypnotize everyone. Unless the citizens of our country and the citizens of other countries are as concerned and attentive to public affairs as they are to their private affairs, we will inevitably fail completely in dealing with our domestic affairs and the problem of world peace. And the problem of world peace will become even more serious due to the invention of the atomic bomb.</p>
<p>Democracy is not a static institution, like a church or a skyscraper. Once democracy is established, it cannot be expected to stand independently generation after generation. Democracy is a living organism, so it must be cared for, cultivated, and guided.</p>
<p>We cannot be satisfied with past achievements and present wealth. All the freedoms we have today have been obtained by resisting tyranny at home or abroad, and most of them have been bought with blood and iron.</p>
<p>Freedom comes through the efforts of those men and women who are willing to give their lives for it. We are their heirs, so we must be careful to preserve our heritage.</p>
<p>Let us choose as our leaders those who truly understand the needs of the people. Some of our leaders, like Jefferson, entered public service to promote democracy and benefit the people. Jefferson had no intention of seeking power, let alone status or favors. He even tried to get Madison to replace him as a candidate for president. Of course, we also have people with the same noble spirit today. We urgently need more religion and morality as the background of government. Here, as everywhere in the world, there is a need to strengthen the religious and moral foundations of thought and action. There is no greater force for civilization than religious and moral ideas. Only when these ideas give people the ability to recognize corruption and tyranny and give them the power to eliminate them can such corruption and tyranny be driven out of government.</p>
<p>The states of the United States should always be mindful of protecting the civil rights of their citizens. The right of all citizens to vote freely should be protected, and their path to the ballot box should not be obstructed.</p>
<p>I believe that Congress and the Executive Branch must observe strict economic thrift in government, and the states, counties, and cities must do the same. In this modern world, most officials and individuals often pay little attention to public or private finances.</p>
<p>Let us adhere to the old policy of individual creativity and free enterprise as much as circumstances permit. The government must play an important role in supervising and inspecting, ensuring the true freedom and fairness of free enterprise, and protecting all the people. But the government must not kill the spirit that has made our nation great. Congress and the Executive Branch have an unavoidable responsibility to keep our foreign policy on a non-partisan basis. During my time in the State Department, I never worked so hard on any issue as I did on this one.</p>
<p>I continue to believe that the requirement in the Senate that the approval of all treaties requires a two-thirds vote should be changed by a constitutional amendment to require only a majority vote for passage. The people, Congress, and Executive Branch of the United States must pay close attention to avoid the United States returning to a dangerous policy of isolationism. The two world wars within a generation should make all Americans realize that we are an important part of the world, that conflicts overseas will inevitably affect us, and that our welfare, peace, and security are linked to those of other countries. We have an unavoidable responsibility to lead and cooperate.</p>
<p>In the past, until 1934, perhaps the most obvious dereliction of duty to the world was our economic isolationism. High tariffs did not bring us prosperity. They brought us unsold surplus goods at home and resentment from other countries overseas.</p>
<p>President Washington spoke out against forming permanent alliances with other countries, although he acquiesced to temporary alliances. But the nature of the United Nations now is an anti-aggression alliance. We should not be shocked by this kind of alliance. It is not an alliance against other groups of countries, but an alliance against any aggression. It is not an alliance for war, but an alliance for peace.</p>
<p>The United Nations organization includes all peace-loving nations, and its establishment, in my opinion, is a turning point in the development of world politics.</p>
<p>But let us not think that the United Nations can perform a miracle. The Charter of the United Nations is a man-made instrument, not a perfect one. For this organization to work effectively, it requires time, patience, and a spirit of cooperation from all countries.</p>
<p>Especially important is the continued cooperation of the five major powers: the Soviet Union, Britain, China, France, and the United States. Only the common friendly cooperation between these five countries can generate the understanding and concerted action necessary to maintain peace.</p>
<p>The United Nations should have and must have the unwavering support of the American people. We should not be discouraged by the conflicting opinions expressed in the various councils of this new organization. We should not believe on the one hand that the United Nations cannot work, so we must restore nationalism and isolationism, and on the other hand that the United Nations is inadequate, so we must replace it with a world government.</p>
<p>We should strive to promote a plan for universal disarmament, with the United Nations implementing supervision in various countries to ensure the execution of this plan. The insane competition of economic and military armament is an accusation against civilization. Those advocating increased armament are playing with the lives and property of tens of millions of men, women, and childre. But disarmament must be comparative, and we must never again allow the United States to decline to a point of military helplessness. When we explain our foreign policy, other countries must still be able to see signs of our strength. Americans must exercise restraint in expressing opinions about other countries. Our nation is accustomed to criticizing other countries and rulers, using adjectives, satire, and ridicule lightly. We forget that these harsh words are not buried in the news columns of newspapers or lost in forums or radio broadcasts. These words are known to the governments and people being cursed, and they will be reprinted and criticized by the newspapers and radios of those countries, because these countries may not understand our freedom of criticism, and these words hinder our diplomatic relations. Before scolding others, one should count from one to ten. To this old rule, I would add a new rule: before scolding another country, we should count for ten hours or ten days, and at the same time, we should ascertain the full truth of the events that seem worthy of condemnation.</p>
<p>I would like to ask American minority groups to pay special attention to this rule, whether these groups belong to racial, national, or religious categories. The purpose of the Constitution is to protect all people, especially minorities. But in recent years, some of these groups have used the progress of reporting and propaganda methods to put forward a voice and pressure on foreign affairs that are disproportionate to their numbers. Most of these minority groups that interfere in foreign affairs are left-wing or reactionary extremists. There are also some people who have recently immigrated to the United States, who are chronic agitators, and their opinions are sufficient to disrupt our political and economic organization. There have been many times when these groups, supported by a uniformly aggressive public opinion, spread poison or otherwise disrupted international relations when our government's international relations required the most delicate and careful handling.</p>
<p>We must recognize and willingly assume our obligations to our former enemies, Germany and Japan. If we must maintain military or other supervision over them for the next few decades, then we should willingly maintain this supervision. We should not harbor the idea of ​​withdrawing rapidly from Europe or Asia.</p>
<p>In the Western Hemisphere, let us continue to develop and expand the Good Neighbor Policy in every possible way. The results we have obtained from this policy prove that we should further cultivate this seed. In our times of trouble, our friends to the south, with only one exception, have proven to be our true friends.</p>
<p>Our country and all countries, especially including the major allied powers that fought to the death against the forces of tyranny last time, are simply deceiving themselves if they do not understand that they will face the greatest crisis in history in the near future. If they are determined to ensure that the forces of peace, order, and civilization continue to progress along with the task of unifying and consolidating their political and moral strength, then they will have great success to maintain the world's lasting peace, freedom, and civilization, and if necessary, to maintain it by force.</p>
<p>All countries must constantly strive to cooperate together on a basis of absolute equality, on the one hand without prejudice, and on the other hand without favoritism or appeasement.</p>
<p>Of the many basic principles of international cooperation, each is extremely important, but the supreme duty that all countries and peoples absolutely cannot escape is to maintain and develop an international organization capable of permanently maintaining peace. Here is a near-axiom: countries that faithfully fulfill the duties of membership in the United Nations organization will receive equal and incalculable benefits, and countries that do not fulfill these duties will encounter increasing difficulties. For the benefit of all, all countries should work together to ensure that this world organization continues permanently and becomes a truly effective organization. Our great country should always facilitate the autonomy and independence of the dependent nations, according to the precedent we have set in the Philippines, when they are ready. But our policy in this regard cannot be limited to sponsorship, but must also include active economic assistance to raise the living standards of these nations.</p>
<p>We must also advocate the free expression of public opinion in the world. Today, there are no free newspapers or radios in the world. Probably half of the countries suppress or filter reports, or color them. We cannot hope to obtain a true understanding that will prevent war until the minds of the nations can communicate with each other completely freely.</p>
<p>I end these memoirs with the following belief: that the destiny of our country is still ahead of us, not behind us. If we are willing to stop at any time to review the past, assess the present, and prepare for the future, then I believe that the horizon of success is still extending before us, like an endless plain. And the most sublime success is to cooperate in harmony with other countries until the whip of war is taken from our backs and a lasting and friendly peace descends upon us.</p>

<h3 id="e76">The Assembly Unanimously Approves: Not to Levy the Hardoon Garden; Estimated Cost Exceeds Seven Hundred and Fifty Billion, the Government Lacks Such Resources; Donation of Land and Construction of Libraries, etc., to be Handled by the Municipal Government <a href="#e76" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c76" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">76</a></h3>
<p>[Our Report] The Municipal Assembly continued its ninth meeting yesterday afternoon, making important resolutions regarding the levying of the Hardoon Garden and the demolition of houses on Tianmu Road. The proposal to levy the Hardoon Garden for a park has been rejected. The demolition of houses on Tianmu Road will be implemented after a committee is first organized to properly plan for the aftermath.</p>
<p>The details of the proposals discussed at the Assembly are recorded below: Regarding the Hardoon Garden issue, there are three related proposals: (1) A letter from David George Hardoon forwarded by the Mayor, stating that he personally owns more than 50 mu of land in the Hardoon Garden and is willing to donate 15 mu, and intends to allocate three-tenths of the proceeds from the sale of the charity foundation's real estate to build a library to present to the government. However, this suggestion was not accepted by the Assembly, resulting in the complete freezing of the Hardoon estate to this day, and affecting the charity's plans. Therefore, it is hoped that the Municipal Assembly will reconsider and pass the proposal for donation to respect property rights and benefit the public. (2) A proposal by Zhang Zhongyuan and others requesting "the prompt implementation of building an art museum using the donated land." (3) A motion by Zhang Naizuo at the fourth general meeting to "implement the spirit of the first and third general meetings of this assembly, resolving to requisition the Aiwen Garden on Nanjing West Road and convert it into a park, changing it to requisitioning the garden as a permanent park for the city to benefit citizens and emphasize public health." This case was resolved as "reserved" at the last general meeting. Therefore, it must be resolved first at this general meeting.</p>
<p>Mayor Explains: Two Options</p>
<p>According to Mayor Wu's explanation: The government can only take two measures regarding the Hardoon Garden: (1) Accept the donation, (2) Completely requisition it. If a decision is made to requisition, it is also possible, but according to the land law, the government must raise sufficient funds within three years, otherwise, the government's credibility will be lost. As for the donation, George Hardoon is donating 15 mu of land under his name, but other heirs are unwilling to donate. George Hardoon is also willing to contribute three-tenths of the proceeds from the sale of the charity foundation's real estate for the construction of a library, which was estimated at about 500,000 US dollars at the time. Now, the Municipal Government, because he is unwilling to increase the land donation, is asking to increase the funding, raising the three-tenths to four-tenths, to which George Hardoon has expressed that he can consider. According to my personal opinion, in addition to accepting his land donation and donation for the construction of a library, it is proposed to requisition another 15 mu of land from the Hardoon Garden to build an art museum.</p>
<p>Huge Expenses: Opposition to Requisition</p>
<p>Following the discussion of the requisition issue, the senators who spoke all expressed opposition to requisition. Jiang Pingfan's reasons for not advocating requisition are: the issue of funding. The land price of the Hardoon Garden cannot be estimated at present. If based on the auction of housing foundations, according to the estimate of 35 years, the land price in the area should be 18 million yuan per mu, but the owner does not agree. After repeated negotiations with the mayor, it was set at 1.2 billion yuan per mu, which is 66 times higher than two years ago, and the land price of the Hardoon Garden should be worth at least 5 billion yuan per mu, which would require 750 billion one yuan for 150 mu.</p>
<p>The government has an empty treasury and has not yet been able to repay the land price for land that has already been requisitioned, let alone for those that have not been requisitioned? Even if there is such a large sum of money, it should be used to solve problems such as people's livelihood or housing shortages, and should not be used to open parks. As for the donation issue, since this matter is beneficial to the citizens and does not burden the country, there is no need to submit it to the Assembly for discussion, and it can be sent back to the mayor for a decision, whether to build a library or an art museum or a Tongzhi Museum, all of which will be handled by the Municipal Government.</p>
<p>Legal and Factual Difficulties</p>
<p>Zhao Yangxiong also stated that requisitioning is difficult in reality. However, Zhang Zhihan believes that the land price of the Hardoon Garden has not yet been estimated, so how can there be a value of 750 billion yuan? If so, why did the previous general meeting not consider this point and insist on passing it? The Executive Yuan has approved the requisition, so there is no need to worry, and the government can requisition it. After he finished speaking, the Speaker immediately stated that the previous general meeting did not pass the requisition. The requisition proposal was only proposed at the fourth general meeting, and the resolution was "reserved." Please pay attention to Senator Zhang. Fei Shusheng, Yue, and Jiang Huaisu also said that requisitioning is difficult in law and in fact, and they do not agree to requisitioning.</p>
<p>Final Vote: Not a Single Endorsement</p>
<p>Chen Cunren also reported that the scenery in the Hardoon Garden is not as imagined by the outside world, and it may not be possible to open a park as soon as the door is opened. About 30 mu of the internal burned land, rockery collapsed, and trees were cut down, and it would cost a lot to build a park. Jiang Hao agrees with the mayor's opinion to accept the donation on the one hand and requisition 15 mu on the other. However, after the Speaker indicated that the Municipal Government intends to requisition separately, it can only be handled according to the law. The plan should be drawn up and submitted to the Assembly for discussion separately, which is not within the scope of this case. Therefore, in the final vote, not a single vote was in favor of requisition (Zhang Zhihan also expressed opposition), and Zhang Naizuo's proposal was rejected.</p>
<p>As for the donation issue, the Assembly resolved to adopt Jiang Pingfan's opinion and return it to the Municipal Government for full handling. The construction of art museums, Tongzhi museums, or libraries will all be planned and managed by the Municipal Government.</p>
<h3 id="e77">The Assembly Passed with Enthusiastic Endorsement: The Chairman is the First President; Resolved to Telegraph the United States to Implement Full Aid to China; Separately Commended the Troops that Contributed to the Elimination of Accumulated Bandits <a href="#e77" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c77" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">77</a></h3>
<p>[Our Report] The motion by the Speaker and Deputy Speaker of the Assembly the day before yesterday to "request the Assembly to unanimously endorse Chairman Chiang of the National Government as the first President" was proposed by the Speaker at yesterday's general meeting, and all the senators in the hall unanimously passed it with enthusiastic applause. Speaker Pan also expressed the hope that the National Assembly representatives elected by regional, professional, and women's groups in this city can abide by the resolution of the public opinion organs of this city and unanimously elect Chairman Chiang as the President at the National Assembly.</p>
<p>In addition, two temporary motions were passed: (1) The motion by Speaker Pan and others "to eliminate accumulated bandits and eliminate chaos by the Songhu Garrison Headquarters, and to request the Assembly to resolve to commend the department and the troops participating in this battle," The Assembly resolved that this case was passed, and at the same time telegraphed the Ministry of National Defense to convey condolences to the soldiers at the front. (2) The motion by the Speaker, Deputy Speaker, and others to send a telegram to the American government and public in the name of the Shanghai Municipal Assembly to immediately implement full aid to China was also passed by the Assembly.</p>
<h3 id="e78">Tianmu Road House Demolition Case: First Plan for the Aftermath and Establish Measures <a href="#e78" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c78" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">78</a></h3>
<p>Regarding the case of demolishing houses on Tianmu Road to widen the road, although it was resolved by the Provisional Assembly earlier, the residents repeatedly made requests, and the Assembly discussed it several times without completion. This time, Pan Jiemei and others proposed "to overturn the decision of the former Provisional Assembly to demolish houses and build roads on Tianmu Road during the period of turmoil in order to relieve the suffering and respect public opinion." However, after the Speaker explained that the rules of procedure of this meeting did not mention the review of a item, it was suggested whether the reasons for the case could be changed slightly. As a result, the reasons for the case were passed as "to temporarily suspend the demolition of Tianmu Road houses during the turmoil period."</p>
<p>Mayor and Bureau Chief Express Opinions</p>
<p>Before the resolution was made, Gua Kang, Chief of the Bureau of Public Works, said that Tianmu Road is a transportational keystone in Zhabei and has a great relationship with urban planning. Widening it will greatly help north-south traffic, so from a technical point of view, widening is necessary. However, he could not express an opinion on the stability of the residents, but he believes that stability and construction cannot be separated.</p>
<p>Mayor Wu said that it is indeed difficult to demolish houses during the period of suppression of the rebellion. However, the construction of the city is a problem for the entire Shanghai. If the Tianmu Road case cannot be implemented, the progress of the city in the future will be restricted. Therefore, the review opinions of the Baocheng Works Committee. After discussion, the Assembly immediately revised it based on the review opinions and made it a resolution: "This case is deeply sympathetic to the residents' complaints of distress, but it has been resolved by the Provisional Assembly and the Assembly for several times, and it has been approved by the Executive Yuan. In order to take into account the current situation, it is proposed that the Municipal Government, together with representatives of the residents, representatives of the district public office and district people's congress, jointly organize a committee to properly plan the aftercare and implement it immediately. However, those who are willing to voluntarily demolish are not subject to this rule.</p>
<p>Houses Protruding on Fuzhou Road: Please the Bureau of Public Works to Plan Comprehensively</p>
<p>There is another similar proposal: "Several houses on the south side of the western section of Fuzhou Road, from the intersection of Baiguangxi Road to Pingwang Street, protrude from the intersection, obstructing traffic. The road should be widened immediately." Resolution: Passed in principle. Regarding the demolition of houses and widening of roads, please the Bureau of Public Works to plan comprehensively according to the road system. In addition, the Mayor submitted four cases for deliberation, including the "Draft Rules for the Address of Factories in Shanghai," due to the nature and importance of the content, please the senators study them first and discuss them at today's meeting.</p>
<p>Residents of Gaoqiao District Demand Impeachment: Senator Qu Willing to Hear the Reasons</p>
<p>Regarding the report that residents of Gaoqiao District demanded the impeachment of Municipal Assemblyman Qu Yue, Assemblyman Qu Yue submitted a letter to Speaker Pan and Deputy Speaker Xu yesterday to explain. The letter is excerpted as follows: "Today, I read in the newspaper that 'Two Thousand Residents of Gaoqiao Demand the Impeachment of Qu Yue,' knowing that residents of Gaoqiao District, Lu Dixiang, Xin Huanqi, etc., believe that this senator's actions in the past year have failed to live up to expectations. Since this senator was elected as a member of the Assembly, I have deeply felt that I have not contributed to the citizens. If I am summoned and dismissed, I can just close the door and reflect on my mistakes, and I can also rest. First, I did not know about it. Now that someone has presented it to the Assembly, I should take this opportunity to announce in public at the meeting the points that have failed to live up to expectations. Not only can this senator correct his mistakes, but also my colleagues in this Assembly can know that the member who is also the first elected district chief of Gaoqiao District, Zhong Yuliang (formerly known as Zhong Renjie), grew up in Gaoqiao and has served in local public affairs and is familiar with the people's sentiments. More than two thousand local citizens have this opinion, and there must be a full city of news. Whether he knows about it or because he has friendship and kinship with this senator, he specifically concealed it, may I ask him to give a brief explanation, and attach it together."</p>

<h3 id="e83">Index Dispute: New Asia Pharmaceutical Factory Slows Down <a href="#e83" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c83" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">83</a></h3>
<p>[Our Report] More than 300 employees of the New Asia Pharmaceutical Factory on Xinzha Road went on strike at 1:00 pm yesterday. The cause was that the factory's business was not good before, and the labor and management agreed that the cost of living index would be discounted according to government regulations, and then discounted by 84%, which would be implemented until the end of this month. After the expiration, the management still requested to continue. The Bureau of Social Affairs is mediating. Yesterday was the date to pay the salary for February, which should have been paid according to the February index. The factory intended to pay according to the business index because the business situation was not good. The employees opposed it. The factory then wanted to pay according to the January index, and the employees could not agree, so they declared a strike. The Bureau of Social Affairs sent personnel to persuade them to resume work and conduct mediation.</p>

<p>[Our Report] Huo Xinhua, chairman of the Shenxin No. 2 Factory Industrial Union, went to the Bureau of Social Affairs and the General Trade Union yesterday to call for help. According to reports, the Shenxin No. 2 Factory authorities intend to dismantle and relocate some of the production equipment (about 20,000 spindles) currently in use to Guangdong in the near future. If this plan is realized, more than 800 workers will lose their jobs. Although the factory promised that some workers could go to Guangdong or transfer to factories in Wuxi, the workers' families are all in Shanghai, and relocation is difficult. Therefore, they requested the General Trade Union and the Bureau of Social Affairs to negotiate with the factory to find a more appropriate solution.</p>

<p>[Our Report] Last year, the city's cotton textile workers could not agree with the management on issues such as wages during power outages and maternity allowances for female workers, and submitted a request to the Bureau of Social Affairs for mediation, but it was not resolved.

<p>Regarding the issue of maternity allowances for female workers, the Bureau of Social Affairs ruled that it should be calculated at seven days per week, but the management only allowed six days, and also requested arbitration. [Our Report] The workers of the Shanghai Brewery went on strike before because the factory dismissed Shi Xiaobao, chairman of the trade union. The Bureau of Social Affairs approved the factory to record a major demerit for Shi Xiaobao and allow him to resume work. The factory said it would not accept it and intended to submit it to the Municipal Government for arbitration.

In addition, the factory dismissed 30 workers, which the Bureau of Social Affairs approved based on past labor-management agreements. The labor side was not convinced and also intended to submit it to the Municipal Government for arbitration.</p>

<p>[Our Report] The indictment regarding the bribery by merchants Mao Runxiang and others in the Jianghai Customs corruption case was officially announced by the prosecutor of the Capital District Court on the 4th. The excerpt is as follows: Mao Runxiang (male, 34 years old, Ningbo native, residing at No. 38, Model New Village, Shanghai, manager of Yifeng Firm), Shao Jiazhen, Guo Ziming (both males, age, origin, and address unknown), Shao Shuping (male, age unknown, residing in Lifengyong Firm, Diandang Street, Shanghai), Shi Yiping (male, age unknown, residing at Xinbeimen, Shanghai, manager of Yifeng Company), Ye Lin (male, age unknown, residing at the intersection of Shilu, Ermalu, Shanghai, manager of Tianhe Firm), Ma Yongnian (male, age unknown, residing at Room 57, No. 119, Renji Road, Shanghai, manager of Minfu Company). The right-handed defendant's bribery case No. 4136 in the year 36 of the Republic of China has been concluded after investigation and is deemed to be prosecuted. The facts and evidence of the crime and the legal articles involved are described as follows:</p>
<p>Facts of the Crime</p>
<p>Mao Runxiang is the manager of Yifeng Firm in Shanghai. In August 35, the firm ordered 400 tons of galvanized iron from the Muji Genji factory in the United States. It was not shipped to Shanghai until September last year. As a result, the import license had expired, and it was difficult to import according to regulations. Mao Fengxiang, the general manager of the firm, and Mao Runxiang, the manager, wanted to pick up the goods, so they asked Fang Maolin to ask Shao Jiazhen, Guo Ziming, etc. to bribe Yin Lansun and others, who were assisting in the Jianghai Customs. Yin and others violated their duties and approved the import of the galvanized iron.</p>
<p>In October last year, Shao Shuping, because the aniline oil, 100 tons, that his service Lifengyong Paint Store purchased from the United States and shipped to Shanghai exceeded the amount stated on the import license, and there was also a batch of paint that arrived at the Shanghai port and had expired, could not be imported. Shao then asked Yang Shude to bribe Yin Lansun and others, who were assisting in the Jianghai Customs, 330 million yuan in national currency, and they were allowed to import it without authorization.</p>
<p>Shi Yiping is an employee of Yifeng Company. In October last year, there were 150,000 pounds of wool shipped from England to Shanghai. Because it was more than the amount stated on the import license, he also asked Yang Shude to dredge up Yin Lansun, bribing him with 300 million yuan in national currency, and he privately released the goods.</p>
<p>The Tianhe Firm that Ye Lin served and the Dakang Firm jointly ordered 64 barrels of paint in the United States. There was no import license originally. It was shipped to Shanghai in October last year, and the license of Xinfu Company was borrowed. According to the rules, the customs was declared. Ye Lin knew that it could not be imported according to law, so he asked Yang Shude to dredge up and bribe Yin Lansun and others, who were assisting in the Jianghai Customs, with 90 million yuan in national currency and smuggle the goods in.</p>
<p>Feng Yongnian is the manager of Minfu Company. In September last year, there were 17.5 tons of paint and 605 barrels of caustic soda shipped from overseas to Shanghai. There was no import license. He asked Chen Liangwang to dredge up the Jianghai Customs and bribe Yin Lansun and others with 120 million yuan in national currency and 16,000 US dollars. He borrowed the paint license of Jinshan Company and bribed Sun and others. Fang also repeatedly asked Zhang Gaozhen, Shao Jiazhen, Guo Ziming, etc. to dredge up Yin and others with 8,000 US dollars, etc., which has been repeatedly admitted by Yin Lansun and Zhang Gaozhen. Moreover, Yifeng Firm is jointly opened by the defendant and Mao Runxiang, and the defendant also assumes important responsibilities, then he and Mao Fengxiang and others obviously have a connection of criminal intent, and they are not allowed to quibble empty words. Furthermore, it was found that the defendant Shao Jiazhen and Guo Ziming went to Zhang Gaozhen for the report of the galvanized iron of the Lukenji Construction Factory</p>

<p>[Our Report from Nanjing, 5th] Yin Lansun, the main culprit in the corruption of the Jianghai Customs Currency Case, was previously sentenced to death by the Capital District Court. It is now known that his defense statement has been drafted by lawyer Fu Kuangyuan and submitted to the District Court. The District Court has recently submitted the entire case file for sentencing to the Supreme Court. In addition to stating that this bribery was caused by the deception of others and could not help himself, the defense attached a certificate from the Customs Service, listing (1) meritorious service in the withdrawal of the Minhai Customs in 33 years, and (2) 18 years of service in the Customs, with excellent work performance, a rare Customs officer, requesting the cancellation of the original sentence and a retrial. Filling in the burning item's muddled declaration, openly importing</p>
<p>Evidence of Crime</p>
<p>It was found that Lukenji Construction Firm had an inquiry with Yifeng, and ordered 400 tons of galvanized iron. When it was shipped to Shanghai in September last year, it was overdue and needed to wait for Shen Qing to change the date before it could be imported. The general manager of the firm, Mao Fengxiang, etc., were eager to pick it up, so they asked Fang Maolin to ask Yin Lansun, who was assisting in the Jianghai Customs, to ask Mei Futang to ask Yin, who was handling the Jianghai Customs, to bribe him. It was also confirmed by the Security Bureau that the matter was verified after sending personnel to Shanghai, and there is an original file to check. Furthermore, according to Zhang Gaozhen's confession, he gave 600 US dollars to the defendant Shao Jiazhen and Guo Ziming for the Lukenji galvanized iron incident. Based on the above, it is beyond doubt that the defendant Mao Fengxiang, Shao Jiazhen, and Guo Ziming paid bribes.</p>
<p>The Anil Lin oil and paint shipped from the United States to Shanghai by Lifeng Shui Paint Store, the wool shipped from England to Shanghai by Yifeng Company, and the paint jointly purchased from the United States by Tianhe and other firms, either had expired when they arrived at the port, or the imported goods exceeded the amount stated on the import license, or there was no import license, and the license of other companies was borrowed. The defendants Shao Shuping, Shi Yiping, and Ye Yunlin separately asked Yang Shude to dredge up Yin Lansun and others, who were assisting in the Jianghai Customs, and paid bribes. The defendant Shao Shuping bribed 330 million yuan in national currency, the defendant Shi Yiping bribed 300 million yuan in national currency, and the defendant Ye Yunlin bribed 90 million yuan in national currency, and smuggled the paint and other items that were not allowed to be imported according to law, which Yang Shude confessed to be true.</p>
<p>In September last year, Minfu Company shipped 17.5 tons of paint and 605 barrels of caustic soda from overseas to Shanghai. The defendant Feng Yongnian asked Chen Liangwang to introduce and bribe Yin Lansun and others, who were assisting in the Jianghai Customs, with 120 million yuan in national currency and 16,000 US dollars, and borrowed the license of Jinshan Company to smuggle them in. Chen Liangwang stated the facts clearly, and the facts were obvious.</p>
<p>In summary, the defendants separately paid bribes to civil servants for behaviors that violated their duties, which constitutes the crime of Article 122, Paragraph 3 of the Criminal Law. A public prosecution is filed in accordance with Article 230 and Article 243 of the Criminal Procedure Law and sent for trial. Prosecutor Tian Jihou.</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] This city's initial conscription quota for this year is 6,000 men. Relevant military service authorities are actively preparing for the lottery process. The Civil Affairs Bureau has hired ten temporary employees to expedite the preparation of the lottery roster and numbering work. The Bureau has also drafted conscription measures, which will be announced and implemented soon. According to the drafted measures, individuals falling under one of the following three categories will be given priority conscription: (1) Those omitted from the roster: citizens who are registered as residents of this city but whose names are not on the military service register. (2) Those omitted from the lottery: individuals whose names are on the military service roster but who have no lottery number. (3) Able-bodied men from other provinces and cities who have deserted military service and come to Shanghai. An official from the Bureau stated yesterday that the purpose of the aforementioned three measures is to prevent desertion. If these measures can fulfill the quota of 6,000 men, it will compensate for the city's initial conscription shortage this year. These measures were previously implemented during wartime but were abolished by the current military service law. To deter cunning and obstinate individuals, the Civil Affairs Bureau is requesting the Ministry of National Defense to reinstate these measures.</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] After Du Qin, the wife of Flying General Wang Zhuo, eloped with the translator John, Wang went to Tianjin to find Du and brought her back to Shanghai. Not long after, Du left home again. Wang filed a lawsuit with the District Procuratorate. During the court hearing a few days ago, Wang accused Du of being unfaithful, while Du accused Wang of abuse. Each side insisted on their version of events. As a result, Prosecutor Liang Gengshun ordered the defendant Du Qin to post bail. At yesterday's hearing, Wang claimed that Du's guarantor was an unemployed vagrant and completely unreliable, posing a flight risk. Furthermore, Wang claimed that Du had instigated several soldiers to take Wang to the Lujiawan Police Station a few days ago, where he was secretly interrogated for several hours.

<h3 id="e100">Charges Against Zha Liangzhu and Fang Zexian Dismissed: District Procuratorate Declines to Prosecute; No Falsehoods in Equipment Requisition; Machine Exchange Not Considered Embezzlement <a href="#e100" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c100" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">100</a></h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] Zha Liangzhu, the chief of the Engineering Section of the Pinghan Railway Zhangluo Section Engineering Office, and Fang Zexian, the manager of the Asian Industrial Company, were previously accused of collusion and embezzlement. After investigation by District Prosecutor Lu Zhennan, the District Procuratorate announced yesterday that it would not prosecute. The original text of the decision not to prosecute stated, in brief: The repair of the Guanyindong Bridge, Tongguanshan Tunnel, and Heishiguan Bridge, all under the jurisdiction of the Zhangluo Section, was urgently needed, but the required equipment was not readily available. Therefore, Wu Shien, the director of the Engineering Office, sent Zha to Shanghai to procure the equipment and authorized him to handle the matter with full authority. After arriving in Shanghai, Zha requisitioned 300,000 pounds of bamboo-joint steel and 200,000 pounds of bolts from the American Surplus Materials department of the Executive Yuan. Subsequently, because the requisitioned bamboo-joint steel and bolts were not entirely suitable, Zha exchanged 150,000 pounds of bamboo-joint steel and 100,000 pounds of bolts with Fang Zexian, the manager of the Asian Industrial Company, for two 250-horsepower diesel engines, one 150-horsepower diesel engine, and one temperature regulator, which were then transported to the Engineering Section for use. The Ministry of Transportation suspected Zha of collusion and embezzlement with Fang and sent a letter to the District Procuratorate for investigation. Before the Defendant Zha Liangzhu exchanged materials with the Asian Industrial Company, he telegraphed Wu Shien, the director of the Engineering Office, for approval. Even if Zha was not authorized to do this, and even if he did not follow auditing procedures, it would still only be an administrative matter and hard to hold him criminally liable. Furthermore, the quantities of bamboo-joint steel and bolts that Zha requisitioned from the Executive Yuan matched the numbers in the inventory of the Executive Yuan's Shanghai Storage and Transportation Bureau's Industrial and Mining Materials Depot. There were no falsehoods. It is also a fact that these materials were American surplus materials, complex in variety and not entirely suitable. Exchanging the unsuitable equipment for machinery urgently needed by the Railway Bureau cannot be immediately considered an act of embezzlement. The bamboo-joint steel and bolts were valued at a total of $38,000 USD, so half of that would be $19,000 USD. Zha Liangzhu exchanged that for the machinery which was valued at $20,400 USD, this cannot be said to have caused any losses to the Railway Bureau. Furthermore, according to the testimony of Agrevanov, the American manager of the Weili Han Foreign Firm, "In February of the 36th year of the Republic of China, each 250-horsepower diesel engine was valued at $18,500 USD in America." The exchange of bamboo-joint steel and bolts for machinery was not only not harmful to the Railway Bureau, it was also extremely beneficial. In summary, since there is no definite evidence to prove that the Defendants Zha Liangzhu and Fang Zexian colluded to embezzle and harm the Railway Bureau, according to Article 268 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, the suspected crimes of the Defendants, etc., are still insufficient. In accordance with Article 1, Paragraph 1 of the Special Criminal Cases Litigation Ordinance, and Article 231, Category 10 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, the decision is not to prosecute.</p>
<h3 id="e101">Truck Accident on the Xihu Road: One Passenger Dies Tragically; Body Buried to Cover Tracks <a href="#e101" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c101" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">101</a></h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] A No. 02.2074 truck owned by the Huili Transportation Company on the Haining Road was hired to transport 58 piglets from Wuxi back to Shanghai on the 1st. The company dispatched driver Gan Linggen and handyman Du Changyuan. A pork merchant also hitched a ride, and the three of them squeezed into the cab, leaving no space. At 5:30 PM, when the truck reached Zhoushanbang in Wuxi, a police officer from the local police station stopped the truck, claiming that a friend of his, Liu Tenghui, wanted a ride to Shanghai. Unable to refuse, but with the truck already full of piglets and no space, they reluctantly allowed Liu to ride on top of the tarpaulin.</p>
<p>About three hours into the journey, as darkness deepened and they entered the territory of Taicang in the Zhintang Highway near Qipu Bridge, the road became narrow and uneven. Suddenly, the truck's headlights broke, and the driver, in a moment of panic and carelessness, caused the truck to overturn. People and pigs were thrown all over the ground, causing numerous injuries. Fortunately, the three men inside the cab were not seriously injured. After struggling out of the cab, they turned back to look at the passenger on top of the truck only to discover that he had been severely injured and was already dead. There were also six dead pigs nearby. After consulting with each other, in order to destroy the evidence of the crime, they moved Liu's body to a tomb about 200 yards south of the accident site, piled it with mud bricks, and buried the body to cover their tracks. Afterwards, they righted the truck, repaired the engine, and drove back to Shanghai. The next day, the truck owner inspected the vehicle and found damage in many places. Furthermore, the two men looked exhausted and suspicious, so he questioned them severely. The two men, feeling nervous and scared, finally confessed the entire story. The owner, understanding righteousness, immediately led the two men to the Detective Division of the Municipal Police Bureau to turn themselves in. Chief Li dispatched section chief Zhu Mengwei, deputy section chief Ma Feimu, and photography section member Fang Meixian, along with Gan and Du, to the accident site to exhume Liu's body and photograph it for evidence. Currently, in addition to searching for the deceased's family, the police bureau will transfer Gan and Du to the District Procuratorate this morning to be prosecuted for the crime of negligent injury causing death.</p>

<p>Yan Jun said: "I am sixty-six years old this year. I will never leave until I return the complete Shanxi to the country!"</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Air Report from Taiyuan on the 2nd] After the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, the communist bandits were frantically scurrying around. During that time, the military mediation group gave the communist bandits a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. As a result, the broad spine of North China was stained red everywhere. The entire territory of Shanxi was left with only four isolated strongholds: Taiyuan, Datong, Linfen, and Yuncheng. 30,000 shells destroyed Datong, but in front of the broken walls and ruins, the enemy was defeated in the face of the extremely strong struggle of the army and people. Yuncheng is adjacent to Shaanxi Province on the east bank of the Yellow River. With the Jincheng River to the north of the river, it is an important town at the southern end of the Datong-Pukou Railway, which runs through Shanxi Province. But under the attack of communist bandits' forces, which were several times larger than the defending army, and with the siege of hundreds of unknown heavy guns, it finally fell, and the essence of southern Shanxi, including the people and all their wealth, was completely lost. Taiyuan has not dared to be spied upon by the communist bandits. Of course, this is because of the battle of Xiaoyi County in the northwest of Taiyuan last year, in which He Long's 200,000 troops were defeated. The main reason is that after General Yan Xishan returned from Kenanpo and "fought" his way into Taiyuan, the first thing he did was to build fortifications. He had seen the communist bandits' sinister intentions clearly during the eight years of the War of Resistance. The suburbs of Taiyuan are densely covered with more than a thousand bunkers and firebases, constructed from brick to steel and concrete, reflecting the fact that the communist bandits have transitioned from fighting bare-handed to possessing machine guns and heavy artillery, and the problem is no longer simple.</p>
<p>Deep Ditches, High Ramparts, Strict Fire Network</p>
<p>When the reporters got off the plane at the South Airport, the first thing that caught their eyes were these firing points that constituted the great plain fire network, deep ditches and high ramparts, a strong defense line against the communist bandits' wave attacks, probably unmatched anywhere. The airport was piled with cement and gravel, trains were running back and forth, and the loess plain was quiet and peaceful. White pigeons were still staying on top of the bunkers, basking in the sunlight. From the perspective of the overall military situation, Mao Zedong led more than 10,000 people from the Japanese prisoner-of-war group led by Kenji Doihara to occupy Xing County in northwestern Shanxi. Chen Yi arrived in Yicheng in southeastern Shanxi. Chen Geng returned north from Quwo. Wang Zhen's four brigades also moved north. Nie Rongzhen's troops fled from the Shanxi-Chahar-Suiyuan border area to the vicinity of Xin County. The target of approximately 200,000 troops seemed to be this iron city - Taiyuan. To say that an offensive would consume at least 400,000 people, so it is speculated that the intention may be to destroy the "soldier-peasant integration" self-defense organization of Shanxi Province, and secondly, to seize Baoding and control Beijing and Tianjin. "Defending to the end will inevitably fail", but today Taiyuan uses defense as a means of waiting for the opportunity to attack. Yuncheng can be said to be a lesson from the past. The use of troops is only zero points and one hundred points. A decisive battle between the main forces is inevitable, just as a fatal blow to the communist bandits is also inevitable. I have the same belief in victory as every soldier and civilian in Taiyuan and the eighteen counties and cities in the Taiyuan area regarding the strong armed forces of Taiyuan.</p>
<p>Political Facilities, Unique and Independent</p>
<p>Only by understanding these objective environments can one understand the origin of all the political facilities in the heart of Shanxi today. Shanxi was a relatively conservative and special province in the past, and it still cannot get rid of this norm. When the reporters paid a visit to General Yan, he said frankly: "I am a soldier. Most of the political measures I have taken are things that I had to do when they were imminent." The "Three Selfs Movement" of self-purification, self-defense, and self-government; the "Four Equalities" of equality in life, equality in right and wrong, equality in sacrifice, and equality in labor; the "Five Anti's" of anti-leftism, anti-rightism, anti-corruption, anti-harassment of the people, anti-exploitation, and anti-injustice; and the "Great Prohibition" of not allowing drug trafficking, drug addiction, gambling, counterfeiting, unfairness, and non-labor; the "civilian economy" based on the principles of simplifying life, protecting life, distributing work, and allocating products; and the "soldier-peasant integration" and other ways to solve the core problem of China's social economy, the land problem, in response to the communist bandits' "land reform," these slogans and methods that can be seen everywhere, appeared one by one under the amazing thinking power of the 60-year-old General Yan. Looking at Shanxi from the perspective of the country and the nation, no one can deny that these laws are the basic conditions for an administrative agency to exist firmly in the red torrent. Today, people who are frowning and worried about life all day long have reached the time when they should open their eyes and take a look at the people who are fighting for life and death.</p>
<p>Pillar Against the Red Tide, Fortress of North China</p>
<p>Shanxi's politics also has such a characteristic: General Yan is like an old grandfather, and the subordinates who follow him now are all the children and grandchildren of his former cadres. The handwritings have no official tone at all, like maxims and family instructions. In the process of governing Shanxi for forty years, he has always used his personality, thought, spirit, and attitude to smoothly promote this family-style government. This is a major factor that Shanxi has been able to become a pillar against the red tide and a fortress in North China.</p>
<p>Historical legend says that Emperor Taizu of the Song Dynasty rebuilt the new city of Taiyuan, and the streets were made in a T-shape. As a result, Shanxi's politics will always "run into nails." Once the "feng shui" was broken, people in Shanxi abandoned politics and went into business, creating the extreme prosperity of the ticket shops during the Qing Xianfeng and Tongzhi years. When a road in front of the Forbidden Army Mansion was changed into a cross shape, Yan Xishan's revolutionary army rushed into Taiyuan from the current Shouyi Gate.</p>
<p>General Yan said in response to reporters' questions: "I am not considering running for vice president, but only considering how to deal with the communist bandits. The country handed me a complete Shanxi with one hundred and five counties and one city, but today there are only thirty-three counties and one city left. I am truly sorry to the country. According to the regulations, I can retire at the age of sixty-two, but I am sixty-six years old this year. I will never leave until I return the complete Shanxi to the country!"

<p>[Our Newspaper Gui Sui, November 28th Airmail Dispatch] The remnants of the Sixth Column of the Communist bandit Nie Rongzhen, entrenched northwest of Manchuria, convened a cadre meeting in Duanwang Village, south of the city, late last month to discuss ways to evade our cavalry's pursuit and suppression. It was decided to issue an order to the cadres of each village to bury a large number of landmines at key road junctions, and to order each village to saw down large trees for use when necessary. The Communist bandits are exhausted and must use landmines and waste materials to stop the advancing pursuit troops. These troops, which this reporter is reporting on, are the Daqingshan Cavalry in the Chahar-Suiyuan Field Army.</p>
<p>The Daqingshan Cavalry is a elite force established by the people of Suiyuan themselves. From the autumn of the 26th year until the winter of the 36th year, the state provided them with excellent equipment. During these ten years, the Daqingshan Cavalry was active in the Daqingshan area, twenty miles north of Gui Sui city, for eight full years. At the beginning of the War of Resistance, they had a total of 20,000 officers and soldiers. After more than 500 active attacks and more than 1,000 passive sweeps and stealth attacks, only more than 5,000 well-equipped and sturdy cavalry remained after the victory of the War of Resistance. Their previous guns were entirely Japanese, and their current horses were entirely from the puppet Mongol army. The government did not spend a penny to establish an iron cavalry that roamed North China, which is also a valuable achievement of General Fu Zuoyi's clean and capable government in Suiyuan for sixteen years. The person who organized the Daqingshan Cavalry and opened up the Daqingshan Anti-Japanese Guerrilla Base was</p>
<p>The First Person</p>
<p>was Guo Huaihan, the captain of the Wuchuan Security Team. After the Lugouqiao Incident in July of the 26th year, General Fu Zuoyi was ordered to lead an expedition to northern Chahar. Before leaving, he told local officials to organize the people for self-defense. Guo Huaihan established the Fourth Route of the Suiyuan People's Anti-Japanese Self-Defense Army from the original security forces of ten districts in Wuchuan, under the command of Yu Cunhao, the current president of the Suiyuan High Court. After Sui and Baotou fell, the First Route of Fengzhen, the Second Route of Baotou, the Third Route of Gui Sui, the Fifth Route of Tuoketuo and Qingshuihe, the Sixth Route of Liangcheng, and the Seventh Route of Sa County, and the Eighth Route of Guyang mostly gathered in the Daqingshan Mountains. In the spring of the 27th year, General Fu launched a counterattack on Gui Sui, and in the winter of the 28th year, General Fu entered Baotou. The Anti-Japanese Self-Defense Army was active behind enemy lines, playing a significant restraining role. Unexpectedly, when Wuyuan was once lost in the spring of the 29th year, it was the first to be annexed by the Communist bandits. At that time, the ones who attacked the headquarters of the Anti-Japanese Self-Defense Army were Yao Zhe, the current commander of the Communist Sui-Mongolian Military Region, and Li Jingquan, the brigade commander of He Long's Third Field Brigade. This time, the Suiyuan Self-Defense Army suffered the greatest destruction, almost completely destroying the Daqingshan Anti-Japanese base. The person who re-captured the Daqingshan Anti-Japanese base and established the Daqingshan Cavalry at the same time is currently in</p>
<p>The Hebei Plain</p>
<p>is fighting, the young general Ouyou San. Ouyou San came from a very humble background. He was originally a child named Guo from Eerqintun in Salachi County. He was abandoned by his parents at the age of three and raised by the Swedish missionary couple Ebi Ke. After graduating from Gui Sui Middle School, he was admitted to the ninth class of the Cavalry Department of the Central Military Academy. After Nanjing was abandoned, he moved to the Chengdu Main School in Sichuan as an instructor. Hearing that the elders and brothers of his hometown were fighting against Japan in the Daqingshan Mountains, he resigned and followed back to Suiyuan on foot from Sichuan, passed through the enemy's blockade, and joined the forward command of the Self-Defense Army as a captain staff officer. When the Communist bandits attacked the forward command of the Self-Defense Army in the 29th year, he escaped one minute before his execution, disguised himself as a herder and gathered the scattered soldiers together. Two days later, he automatically regained the anti-Japanese base, thus establishing his leadership position in the Self-Defense Army.</p>
<p>In the spring of the 34th year, General Fu Zuoyi also let Ouyou San command the American-equipped army trained in Houtao to fight behind enemy lines. He and the American advisors were often stationed in Shuijiangoumen, twenty miles north of Sa County. Japanese soldiers lived in the old Sui railway station in Sui County and Xinaobao in Baotou. After nightfall, it became Ouyou San's world. During this period, the Daqingshan Cavalry avenged the hatred of the 29th year and destroyed the base established by the Communist bandits in Jingergou in Daqingshan. If General Fu Zuoyi did not have this unit of Ouyou San active behind enemy lines, it would probably have increased a lot of trouble in receiving Sui and Baotou, and it would not have been possible to breathe freely in the two dusty isolated islands when defending Sui and Baotou. After</p>
<p>The Siege of Sui and Baotou was Lifted</p>
<p>Ouyou San had more than one hundred cavalry and infantry. The general reorganized his cavalry into a provincial security division, and sent the infantry back to Wuchuan, Guyang, Taolin, and Zhan County to serve as local regiments. Ouyou San collected the old, weak, and disabled to cultivate land near Daolanhua. Ouyou San's prestige in the Daqingshan area was second only to Generals Fu and Xue. When he attacked Jining in the past year, more than 3,000 militia groups assisted him in pursuing He Long's troops. In the past year, General Fu Zuoyi relied on Ouyou San's Daqingshan Cavalry and an infantry division to stabilize the rear of Chahar and Suiyuan, and recovered Zuoyun Youyu in Yanbei, and went on an expedition to northern Shaanxi to relieve the first siege of Yulin.</p>
<p>The Daqingshan Cavalry, tempered for ten years, was officially reorganized into a powerful national defense force in the autumn of last year. In January of this year, it opened up to Hebei, and, like General Fu Zuoyi's two swords, pointed to Nie Rongzhen's bandit lair.</p>
<p>Major General Ouyou San is only thirty-seven years old this year and has been injured more than twenty times. Until now, there are still</p>
<p>Two Bullets</p>
<p>have not been removed from his knees, neck, and calves. Ten years of guerrilla life has tempered Ouyou San and his officers and soldiers into wild horses. Ouyou San goes to bed late every night and gets up before dawn. He uses short periods of rest like a horse instead of full sleep. The success of Major General Ouyou San proves the greatness of the people's armed forces. General Fu Zuoyi's cultivation of the Daqingshan Cavalry also points out a bright road for many military leaders to break through dangerous environments. (Our Newspaper Reporter Liu Yingyuan)</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper Jurong, 3rd Dispatch] Since last autumn, a large number of Huaihebei refugees have arrived in Xiashu and Qiaotou in this county. Due to the lack of relief, they have recently formed groups to chop down forests, trees, and mountain firewood in Jiaoli Township, Zhujiabian, and other places to make a living. In order to protect their property rights, the mountain people have frequently clashed. Unfortunately, at dawn on the (3rd) of this month, the mountain people sounded gongs and fired guns as a demonstration, triggering a confrontation. The two sides gathered about 2,000 people, as if facing a formidable enemy. The county government specially sent Wang Yuya, the police chief, to Xiashu and Qiaotou on the afternoon of the (2nd) for inspection. He was trying to mediate when gunshots were heard. He rushed to suppress the situation, but because the two sides were fighting each other, the order was chaotic and impossible to stop. As a result, three refugees were shot and four were seriously injured. They were escorted to Zhenjiang Hospital for emergency treatment overnight. Director Wang specially convened an emergency meeting of local Bao chiefs and gentry at 9 p.m. that night and organized a "3-3 Incident" aftercare committee to prevent the incident from escalating. The issues of comforting the families, treating the injured, and providing relief are still under discussion.</p>

<p>The "Reader Scholarship" for the spring of the 37th year sponsored by this newspaper has received applications from the university and middle school groups since it began on January 12th. "All are recommended by the school authorities," totaling more than 500 people. Among them, more than 170 people in the university group have already completed the preliminary review and sent them to the Municipal Scholarship Unified Review Committee for re-examination. More than 300 people in the middle school group have also completed the preliminary review and will be sent to the Scholarship Unified Review Committee for re-examination immediately. The announcement of each list will be made within about three or four days, and the scholarship can be issued. The middle school group will be no later than the middle of this month. Because there are a large number of applicants for this "Reader Scholarship," and the scholarship is only 600 million yuan, the review results show that those who are qualified account for three-fifths, and the remaining two-fifths are unable to help due to the scarcity of porridge and many monks. We deeply regret this and hope that we can select more candidates in the next session.</p>

Although there were only a few spectators, it gathered the essence of Shanghai's basketball circles. It can be called an ideal team.

The line-up for the United team was Chen Jiayi and Wen Hua as forwards, Wu Chengzhang and Cai Wendan as left and right wings, and Li Zhen and Bao Song as centers. Within five minutes, they took a 6-0 lead, showing excellent cooperation. The first quarter ended 9-1. In the second quarter, Cai Zhongqiang, Chen Xuechong, Liu Fushan, Cai Lianke, and Huang Bai took the field, giving a fresh look.

Da Li occasionally made unexpected shots, which were incredibly exciting. This quarter ended 33-19. In the final quarter, Tu, Bao, Wenzhang, Zhongqiang, and Xiangcheng cooperated well. MacLeans's He Gu stood out under the basket, but the United team kept attacking, making the score 43-29. The line-ups of the two teams changed frequently.

<p>The rules for various championships and exhibition competitions of the National Games, totaling more than 20 types, have been compiled by the association and handed over to the Zhengzhong Book Company for printing. They will be distributed to various units for reference. However, due to the large number of types and the time required for printing, the types currently being typeset and bound include track and field, all-around, soccer, men's basketball, women's basketball, volleyball, swimming, and diving, totaling six types. Track and field and volleyball can be published within three days. The rest, such as softball, water polo, tennis, and table tennis, are being compiled and will be submitted for typesetting soon. The rules used this time, for track and field, are based on the 1939 international rules. Men's basketball is based on the 1947-48 US-Canada rules, women's basketball is based on the 1946-47 US rules, and softball is based on the 1947 US softball rules. The content is richer than before, and the wording has been revised in many places. However, there is an urgent need for these new rules in various places. In order to reduce difficulties, the association will first announce the important changes to the track and field and women's basketball rules as follows:</p>
<p>(A) Key Points of Track and Field Rules</p>
<p>(1) The provision that there should be an approximate two-second pause between "Ready" and the firing of the gun at the start has been cancelled. The starter must fire the gun only after observing that all athletes are calm and consistent. (2) Starting blocks are now permitted for legal use. (3) For staggered starts on curved lanes, the starter should stand in a position approximately equidistant from all athletes. (4) Methods of judging rankings when the results are equal in high jump or pole vault: 1. The winner is the athlete with fewer attempts at the last cleared height. 2. If there is still no difference, the winner is the athlete with fewer failed attempts throughout the entire competition. 3. If it still cannot be resolved, the winner is the athlete with fewer attempts at the starting posture throughout the entire competition. (4) If it still cannot be divided, and it belongs to the resolution of the first place, make another attempt at the height of the last common failure. If the result of the fourth attempt is that two or more people jump over, then the height should be raised by two centimeters, and each should be given a chance to try once. If the results of the fourth attempt all fail, then it should be lowered to the height of the last successful jump, and try again once, so increase and decrease, and try once at each height, until the winner is judged. (5) If it cannot be divided and it is for resolving other rankings, then the two or more people are judged to be tied. 5. If the results are equal in field events where the winner is determined by distance, the second-best result of each attempt or throw should be used to determine the ranking. If the second-best results are also equal, then the third-best result should be used to determine the ranking, and so on. (According to the rules as amended, the results of each attempt or throw in the triple jump and throwing events must be recorded in full, not just the best result, so that there is no way to resolve the ranking). (6) New-style hurdles are used for the hurdles, and knocking them down does not affect the score.</p>
<p>(B) Key Points of Women's Basketball Rules</p>
<p>(1) Any forward can receive the ball in the center circle, without designation. (2) A player who runs out of bounds must return to the court at the point where they exited. (3) The boundary line is considered in bounds if it is in the neutral zone, and out of bounds if it is out of bounds. (4) When a timeout is called in the last minute of each quarter, the remaining time is added to the next quarter. (5) A jump ball is only awarded when players are holding the ball simultaneously. If there is a sequence in time, the ball belongs to the player who gained possession first. (6) It is a technical foul for an opponent to touch the ball with their hand when the ball is already in a player's hand (unintentional contact is not a foul). (7) There is no limit to the number of taps during a jump ball, but this is not allowed after the jumpers have left the circle. (8) During a free throw, the referee should place the ball on the free throw line for ten seconds, starting from the moment it is placed. (9) If a free throw is missed, the game continues unless it should be a dead ball.

<h3 id="e150">Social Bureau Strictly Enforces Rice Rationing Details: Rice Purchase Certificates Prohibited from Lending or Transferring, Preventing Citizens from Exchanging Rationed Rice for White Rice at Rice Shops. Yesterday, Another 3 Million Guan of White Rice Left Northern Shanghai. <a href="#e150" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c150" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">150</a></h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] The rice market continued to rise yesterday. According to Ji Mingzhai, chief of the Grain Section of the Social Bureau, the reason for yesterday's rice price increase was that citizens were exchanging rationed rice for white rice at rice shops by paying a price difference. Rice merchants were therefore absorbing large quantities of white rice in the market for exchange purposes. After discovering the above situation, the People's Food Allocation Committee, in accordance with Article 17 of the Detailed Implementation Rules of the Temporary Measures for Rice Rationing per Capita in Shanghai: "Various rice purchase certificates must not be lent or transferred. If there is a violation of the above situation, both the lender and the recipient shall be fined five times the amount for the first offense, and the penalty shall be doubled for each subsequent offense." The committee has dispatched supervisors to secretly investigate in various districts. If such a situation is found, it will be dealt with in accordance with the provisions of Article 17.</p>
<p>The re-emergence of 3 million guan of white rice outside the city, coupled with the rising prices in Xishi, has affected the people's hearts in Shanghai. The arrival of goods is also small, and with the easing of funds among the industry, it has further promoted the rise in the rice market. Yesterday, the rise in the northern market was greater than in the southern market. The price of white rice in the northern market reached 3.05 million yuan, and the price of special high-quality rice even reached a high of 3.14 million yuan, an increase of 150,000 yuan. In the southern market, white rice was only 2.92 million yuan, Zhejiang rice was 2.9 million yuan, and special rice was 2.97 million yuan, each higher than the previous day by 20,000 to 30,000 yuan. Xian rice was relatively strong, with Wuhu machine xian rice at 2.8 million yuan, an increase of more than 100,000 yuan compared with the previous day. Yesterday's total arrival of goods in the north and south markets was 7,766 shi.</p>
<p>Flour</p>
<p>The rice market has risen again, and tin prices are also high. Even if the northern gangs do not take action, people's hearts have already wavered. With ample funds, the owners are reluctant to sell. Lao Che flour opened at 1.38 million yuan, but the Nahu also expressed indifference to this high price, causing it to soften later and fall back to 1.36 million yuan, which is 30,000 yuan higher than the previous day. Bingchuan flour was 1.34 million yuan, and the market was more stable. Jiangfeng and Jiancheng were the softest in the market, but rebounded at the close, each closing at 1.33 million yuan. Bran was flat, with the wheat flour factory at 1.9 million yuan.</p>
<p>Cooking Oil</p>
<p>The initial price of soybean oil returning to the market was very low. Dayou soybean oil opened at 6.08 million yuan, and there were a few transactions. The low price attracted buyers, and sales suddenly became smooth in the middle, so it rose steadily, closing at 6.25 million yuan, 50,000 yuan higher than the previous day. Other soybean oils also rose. Jiton's raw oil ranged from 7.15 million to 7.2 million yuan, similar to before. Raw vegetable oil rose by 100,000 yuan. Little Car's sesame oil was stable. The Taiwanese gang of bean cake buyers actively absorbed it, rising after being flat. Changzi cake was 720,000 yuan, and the others were 710,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Miscellaneous Grains</p>
<p>Yellow beans experienced many twists and turns. The morning opening was stable. The Hakka gangs did not move, and the owners were unwilling to sell at low prices. Hankou Zha beans opened at 1.5 million yuan, and the Hakka gangs came to take them, pushing the price up to 1.55 million yuan. Later, the Hakka gangs suddenly stopped buying, and the price returned to 1.5 million yuan. Finally, the bean cake rose, and the oil factories came to buy, so the market recovered again, rising to 1.55 million yuan, but it was not easy to buy. There were buyers from the Qingdao gang at the morning opening of corn, and the market rose by 50,000 to 100,000 yuan. Jishu corn was priced at 1.91 million yuan. Although the Qingdao gang bought, their appetite was not big, and the price tended to fall, eventually remaining the same as the previous day. Sesame and white sesame rose slightly by 20,000 yuan, and the market was stable. Jianqing was flat, and red sorghum rose slightly by 50,000 yuan. Dugshengren rose by 200,000 to 300,000 yuan, due to the strong buying by the Guangdong gang. Qinhuangdao Dugshengren was priced as high as 4.1 million yuan, and Dawenkou Dugshengren was priced at 3.9 million yuan, an increase of 300,000 yuan.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the sugar market increased by another 5 yuan to 150 yuan in Taiwan dollars, and the quota for the tenth phase was reduced, and the trend continued to tighten. The association's pricing, the current spot price of one and four crude white was 3.935 million yuan, four and a half carts of white bagged goods were 4.12 million yuan, grass bags were 3.8 million yuan, and oil by-products were 580,000 yuan. 20 sand white was 3.55 million to 600,000 yuan, a rise of 100,000 to 200,000 yuan, respectively.</p>
<p>The atmosphere in the consignment note trading market was tight. The eighth phase of medium sand white was priced at 1.59 million to 1.9 million yuan, the ninth phase of crude white rose from 970,000 yuan to 1.25 million yuan, the tenth phase of medium sand white was 930,000 yuan to 1.14 million yuan, and the four and a half white was 1.13 million yuan to 470,000 yuan, with the most significant increases.</p>
<p>Due to the inverted production costs, local sugar also followed the upward trend. Shantou Qing was 2.558 million yuan, a rise of more than 100,000 yuan. Xingbai was 3.7 million to 600,000 yuan, and Xingchi was 2.6 million to 640,000 yuan, a rise of 200,000 yuan.

<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] In order to uniformly handle the transportation of flour to Pingjin from Jinan, the Central Trust Bureau specially advanced funds to the Fourth District Flour Association to purchase a total of 350,000 bags in the first batch. The flour price will be calculated based on the price of wheat in Wuxi. It is now learned that in order to cooperate with the policy of the Ministry of Food, the Fourth District Flour Association is trying to prevent fluctuations in the price of wheat in Xishi, so as to avoid extra losses to the government. In addition to notifying the factories in Xishi and the purchasing agencies of other factories stationed in Xishi not to raise the price of wheat, they are also closely watching for any other institutions raising the price of wheat in the area, and plan to report to the Ministry of Food when necessary for effective prevention.</p>

<p>Chinese stocks rose and fell repeatedly yesterday. Except for Maya, which fell to the limit, and Zhongxing and Zhongfa, which rose to the limit, the remaining stocks were generally volatile. Although Yongsheng had internal support and external encouragement, the high price was not easy to maintain and eventually closed lower.</p>
<p>The morning opening was stable. Yong Sheng opened at prices of 1,195 yuan and 1,255 yuan. After the opening, it first fell to 1,190 yuan and 1,250 yuan. Number 153 and others submitted increasing prices. Number 165 and others immediately made the delivery, rising to 1,215 yuan and 1,280 yuan. Number 152 and others vigorously sold for immediate delivery. Number 202 and others divested themselves and submitted the delivery. Funds became tight, especially among insiders, falling to low prices of 1,170 yuan and 1,237 yuan. At this time, miscellaneous stocks went in the opposite direction. Zhongfa had a large number of people fighting to absorb cheap ones, rising rapidly and unexpectedly reaching the upper limit. Maya sold small quantities and reached the lower limit. Zhongxing Steamship reached the upper limit, and the situation was uncertain. However, the insiders were very optimistic. Foreign stocks and cloth rose. Number 224 and others increased their immediate delivery. Number 35 and others increased the submission of deliveries, especially Number 224, which absorbed immediately and delivered. Number 104 was the most diligent in submitting deliveries. Yong Sheng rose again to new peaks of 1,230 yuan and 1,305 yuan. Funds were unfavorable to the bulls. Number 95 and others sold vigorously for immediate delivery. Number 188 and others jointly settled for delivery. The noon closing fell to low prices of 1,165 yuan and 1,235 yuan. Rumors helped the selling. The price of cloth fell slightly, and the selling trend turned prosperous. Compared with the previous closing, stocks for immediate delivery, Maya fell to the limit and then rebounded, with a strong half-cent increase. Zhongfa rebounded after rising to the limit, rising by 10%. Zhongxing rose to the limit. Xinhua and Yonggong were still flat. Rongfeng Innerwear rose slightly. Zhongsi, Zhongni, Zhongfang, and Hengfeng fell by half a cent. The rest fell slightly. Stocks for delivery, Maya and Jingfu fell by half a cent. Xinhe was flat.

<p>With reduced pressure on the market, Yong Sheng slightly rose to 1,190 yuan and 1,260 yuan at the opening. Number 157 and others made the delivery. Number 105 bought on average every week. Number 54 submitted the delivery, rising to 1,215 yuan and 1,270 yuan. Number 232 and others submitted the delivery. Number 163 came out for immediate delivery and reported a rebound. However, because Number 13 and others sold, and Number 36 and others bought, coupled with the small amount of National Bank intervention, a stalemate was formed. Before the close, Number 104 and others closed out Yongsheng, falling to low prices of 1,180 yuan and 1,228 yuan. The closing price was 1,188 yuan and 1,238 yuan. As a result, compared with the morning's close, stocks for immediate delivery, Xinhua, Jinglun, Yonggong, and Commercial Press were flat. Zhongfa rose to the limit. The rest saw minor gains and losses. Unlisted stocks traded off-market, with Xinxin and Dasheng rising by 10% being the most popular. Cultural and Public Utilities were only slightly stable.</p>

Securities firms and Guangdong gangs were buying. The supply from retail investors was limited. As a result, compared with the previous close, Wheelock Marden, Yeguang, Yida, Hangye, and Steel each rose by more than 10%, and the rest rose by more than half a cent.</p>

<p>The artificial silk market was weak at first yesterday. Following the rise in factory silk, people's hearts were slightly boosted. No. 120 Xu's word had light, the market opened at 52 million yuan in the morning, then gradually rose, the maximum was 60 million yuan, recovered to 58 million yuan at noon.

<h3 id="e156">Fine Yarn Firm, Cotton Cloth Continues to Rise <a href="#e156" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c156" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">156</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's cotton yarn market saw a positive opening as those with ample funds bought on sight, and merchants from Tianjin, Guangdong, and other regions showed strong interest, driving prices steadily upwards. Near closing, however, due to resale activities from Guangdong merchants and short selling, the 42-count Blue Phoenix fine yarn, after initially rising, fell back to 129 million yuan, a slight increase of 2 million yuan from the previous day. The 21-count Double Horse yarn initially rose but then declined by 500,000 yuan, with warehouse receipts also falling by 500,000 yuan. Other grades of coarse yarn, such as the 20-count, saw sluggish sales and generally declining prices, ranging from 400,000 to 1.78 million or 1.8 million yuan. Yesterday's cotton cloth market opened with significant pressure from Shanxi merchants selling, leading to a brief dip in quoted prices. However, due to urgent shipments of goods previously released by Hankou merchants, there was strong demand for "yuan bi ji" (a type of fine cloth), and dyeing factories also actively purchased grey cloth at lower prices. Cloth merchants then moved to cover their positions, and prices gradually rose.</p>
<p>Twelve-pound Dragon Head fine cloth, with merchants buying more than selling, rose directly to 2.95 million yuan at closing, echoing the frenzied surge of other fine cloths by 180,000 to 100,000 yuan. The Four Gentlemen "bi ji" saw a dramatic increase of 210,000 yuan due to the Spinning &amp; Construction Company's prolonged absence from the market and Hankou merchants' acquisition activities. Additionally, colored cloth and high-end 190 Shilin cloth also saw lively sales, rising by 100,000 to 200,000 yuan. Grey cloth manufacturers were optimistic, and market sentiment was buoyant.</p>
<p>Spinning &amp; Construction Company Sells Yarn</p>
<p>[Our Dispatch] Yesterday, the China Spinning &amp; Construction Company sold ten types of yarn as usual, totaling 952 pieces, equivalent to 1507.5 pieces of 20-count yarn, to 409 approved buyers. The opening prices for each type of yarn were as follows: 20-count Lucky Elephant at 67.5 million yuan, 6-count Sub-Sunlight at 34 million yuan, 8-count Sunlight at 37 million yuan, and 10-count Li Ma cone yarn at 44 million yuan. 32-count Joyous Crane at 90.5 million yuan, 32-count Double-Strand Harvest at 112 million yuan, 40-count Sunlight cone yarn at 99 million yuan, and 40-count TK Colored Ball at 129 million yuan.</p>

<h3 id="e157">Resolution of Unified Tax Burden Issue <a href="#e157" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c157" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">157</a></h3>
<p>The Six District Cotton Spinning Association repeatedly presented its views to the Yarn Management Committee regarding the issue of how to bear the increased unified tax on warehouse receipts for spun cotton yarn that had not yet been picked up: (1) If the factory has no physical stock available for warehouse receipts of spun cotton yarn upon maturity, the factory should bear the increased unified tax after the expiration date. (2) If the factory has sufficient physical stock available for warehouse receipts of spun cotton yarn upon maturity, but the association has not picked it up, the holder of the receipt should bear the increased unified tax after the expiration date. The responsible department of the Yarn Management Committee expressed its agreement. However, to avoid past disputes, it hoped that cotton yarn released before February 23 would not be subject to consideration. The Six District Association believed that the previous day's report that the Yarn Management Committee required the spinning factories to bear the increased unified tax was unreasonable. Therefore, yesterday afternoon, representatives Wang Qiyu, Rong Erren, Liu Piji, and Zhu Zhuyi visited Chairman Yuan to present their reasons. Chairman Yuan adopted their views and approved the original proposal as mentioned above.</p>

<p>Yesterday's firewood and charcoal market saw an increase in the price of coal per "jin" (a unit of weight) by more than 40%, which led to a rise in wholesale prices. This resulted in unusually strong sales in this street, with steady purchases from households. Since the Lunar New Year, however, the arrival of goods has been limited, and the market's inventory has decreased, leading to a gradual rise in quoted prices. Chestnut firewood continued to rise by 20,000 yuan per "dan" (a unit of weight) to 240,000 yuan, mixed firewood to 210,000 yuan, pine firewood to 200,000 yuan, green charcoal rose to 800,000 yuan per "dan," white charcoal to 660,000 yuan, and black charcoal to 530,000 yuan, an increase of 10% to 20% compared to the previous day.</p>

<p>The China Import and Export Trade Association recently learned that domestic food products exported to the United States and Hawaii should pay attention to the following points: (1) Items containing salicylic acid or saccharin (such as dried plums and sweets) are strictly prohibited from import. (2) The wording on the label must be in English. If Chinese and English are used in parallel, they must be consistent without any additions or subtractions. (3) The name of the goods must be accurate. (4) Before the goods are canned, they should be inspected to remove any deteriorated items and must be sealed with new methods according to US regulations. Furthermore, medicinal materials must be clean and free of insects to be considered qualified. Newly invented products must provide detailed descriptions of the various substances and usage, and they must be registered in the United States first.</p>

<h3 id="e162">Decision to Start with Tung Oil for the Purchase of Important Export Goods; Tung Oil Exports in February Sharply Reduced Compared to January <a href="#e162" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c162" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">162</a></h3>
<p>The government has decided to continue purchasing important export goods. The purchase methods have been drafted by the National Economic Commission. The types of goods to be purchased are temporarily limited to six: tung oil, pig bristles, tea, soybeans, eggs, and raw silk, to be executed by the China Trust Bureau. It is understood that the implementation details of this method were finalized by the Executive Yuan's subcommittee on the 6th, and the China Trust Bureau can begin to handle it next week. The Executive Yuan has decided to start with the purchase of tung oil, followed by pig bristles, tea, raw silk, and the other five types. The purchase price will be determined by the Purchase Price Review Committee, with representatives from the Ministries of Finance, Economy, and Agriculture, the Central Bank, the Transport Management Committee, and the China Trust Bureau participating. The price will be calculated based on the actual cost of production in the producing areas, taking into account the profits of producers as a principle. After the purchase, the exporters will still be entrusted to transport and sell the goods, and the profits and losses will be borne by the national treasury.</p>
<p>[Further Report] According to related sources: In February, my country's tung oil exports, Shanghai accounted for 3,100 tons, Hong Kong accounted for 3,000 tons. In January, the export volume, Shanghai accounted for 5,700 tons, Hong Kong accounted for 4,500 tons. The export volume of tung oil in February was significantly reduced. The reasons are: (1) The foreign exchange rate has not been adjusted with general prices, causing manufacturers to often have to donate about 50%. (2) The payment for export goods has not yet been liberalized. And most manufacturers should be in short supply of funds, and turnover is difficult. (3) The Yangtze River water level is still at a low tide, and cargo transportation is blocked. Therefore, most of the tung oil currently exported is early orders, and there are no new orders, so the pre-transportation prospects for tung oil exports in March are still very bleak.</p>

<p>[Our Dispatch from Wuxi] In this county, the silk, yarn, flour, and food industries, due to long-standing practices, still settle their accounts at the end of the lunar year. Now, in the middle of the lunar New Year of Wuzi, the profits and losses for the year Dinghai have been fully revealed by various industries.</p>
<p>Judging from the overall year-end accounting situation of various industries last year, it seems to be better than the previous year. Although various industries were affected by currency fluctuations, the abnormal phenomenon of more legal tender and fewer goods was presented. However, because most of the people in charge of various industries were more cautious, they had raised funds around the 24th day of the twelfth lunar month to safely overcome the difficult year-end settlement. Even if there was cash released on New Year's Eve, there was a lack of inquiries, which was the opposite of the state of stores being busy adjusting funds on New Year's Eve in the previous year.</p>
<p>Even more gratifying is that regarding bad debt incidents, except for Fan Jiahua, who failed in speculative cotton yarn and flour and ran away with more than 700 million yuan, the other merchants safely passed through, and no such incidents occurred. The general situation of profits and losses of various industries is briefly described below:</p>
<p>Flour Mills</p>
<p>The flour mill industry, with larger scopes, includes Maoxin, Jiufeng, Zengfeng, Guangfeng, Huaxin, and other seven or eight companies. Last year, because transportation to the north was smooth, although raw material prices fluctuated from time to time, the flour price was still based on the wheat price, and the prices rose with the tide, so there was no impact. The factories were strong, and most of the raw materials were prepared in advance. They worked day and night, and the output was abundant. The sales were in the valley, and the prosperity of their business was unprecedented in recent years. Therefore, the profits were quite rich. Among the various industries in the county, it can be called second to none.</p>
<p>Yarn Mills</p>
<p>The first half of last year was the golden age of the yarn mill industry. The 20-count Double Fish yarn produced by large factories such as Qingfeng was the standard yarn in the cotton yarn market in Xiyi. The brand was well-known and was well-received by customers, so it was naturally a prosperous source of wealth and countless profits. Secondly, the Shenxin Zhenxin Yarn Factory has a large scope and abundant profits. In addition, small and medium-sized yarn mills also presented a vigorous atmosphere and each had a surplus, which was not much different from that of flour mills. Cloth mills had excessive expenses, and there was a slight surplus at the end of the year.</p>
<p>Silk Mills</p>
<p>There are more than 50 silk mills in the county. Last year, various factories were operating vigorously in the tide of prices. Most of the large factories were engaged in government-commissioned reeling, so the surplus was very small. The small and medium-sized silk mills went smoothly after the spring silkworms spread. The silk prices fluctuated sharply, especially the sales of silk for users were the best. However, due to the lack of raw materials, the factories stopped work early. In short, last year's silk mill industry was better than the silk mill industry in 1935.</p>
<p>Rice and Grain</p>
<p>The business of the grain market here is the crown of all the counties on the Beijing-Shanghai line. Merchants from various places transport rice, paddy, wheat, and miscellaneous grains to Wuxi in an endless stream. The total amount of daily transactions is more than 20,000 "dan." Various rice firms sell and buy on behalf of customers and charge commissions. General brokers hold sample bags and go to the market to discuss prices at 10 am. Last year, rice prices soared, jumping again and again. Therefore, more than 200 rice firms in the county were in full swing and mostly profitable. Longmao Rice Firm, which has strong financial resources, has a surplus of about 20 billion, and Yide Rice Firm also has more than 6 billion. The rice milling industry is also operating well and is in a state of surplus without loss.</p>
<p>Money Shops</p>
<p>Last year, various money shops in the money shop industry had stable loans, and were not affected by bad debts throughout the year, and they all received high profits. Especially the Yonghengfeng and Zengda money shops, the profits were the most abundant. The surplus of cooperatives and underground money shops is even more astounding. Commercial banks also have a surplus, but compared with underground money shops, they are far behind.</p>
<p>Oil Mills</p>
<p>In the Xiyi oil mill industry, the three with strong capital are Hengde, Runfeng, and Jiancheng. The daily output is more than 2,000 "dan." With the arrival of soybeans filling up, the oil pools of various factories are full and there is no place to store them. Last year, the oil was once sluggish, but at the end of the year, it was unique and repeatedly created new high prices. Each "dan" has been above the 4 million mark. Therefore, various factories have profits to be made. Except for Yuan Chunlong and Yuan Chunxin, one of the three major oil firms, each has a surplus. The various firms such as Yuan Da maintain expenses, and other firms have varying profits and losses.</p>
<p>Hotels</p>
<p>The larger hotels include Taishan, China, Jinghu, and Huizhong. In the midst of price fluctuations and economic turmoil, the impact on the entire business is mostly a loss. The other hotels such as Zhongnan, Dalu, Tianran, and Wanxin have successively added funds and reorganized. Other hotels also rely on high-interest loans to maintain themselves, quenching their thirst with poison. They all have a state of hanging upside down. Except for Yingsailou, which has a slight surplus, most of the restaurants are losing money, and medium-sized restaurants such as Yang Tianxing have some surplus due to saving expenses and fewer customer accounts.</p>

<h3 id="e164">On the Era of the Stone Drums: A Response to Mr. Tong Shuye <a href="#e164" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c164" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">164</a></h3>
<p>— Tang Lan</p>
<p>I was kindly sent the sixty-eighth issue of the Shanghai Central Daily News Cultural Relics Weekly, dated January 7, by Mr. Di Zhongxiu, containing Mr. Tong Shuye's article "A Critique of Mr. Tang Lan's Theory that the Stone Drums Were Carved in the Third Year of Qin Linggong." I was very pleased after reading it. I had long anticipated criticism when I wrote that article, because people in general tend to be very conservative. When I say the Stone Drums date to the Warring States period, others invariably insist on Qin Wengong, Qin Xianggong, Qin Mugong, and some even claim King Cheng, King Xuan, or the Northern Zhou or Later Wei dynasties. Such are the inevitable outcomes of contentious debates rooted in stubborn biases. Nevertheless, amidst this chaotic era of high costs and scarce resources, the mere fact that individuals still engage in discussing these trivial matters should be cause for celebration.</p>
<p>I am most grateful for Mr. Tong's pointing out that, while I had stated that the Stone Drums use the character "過" eleven times, he has corrected it to fourteen. (There are a few other instances where Mr. Tong cites the original text with interposed dots, which I believe must be typographical errors.) Regarding the question of the "吾" character, Mr. Tong devoted considerable effort to demonstrating that the Book of Documents contains first-person pronouns such as "予," "我," and "朕." The character "予" is used in the singular nominative case, equivalent to the character "余" in bronze inscriptions. The character "朕" is often used in the singular possessive case, while the character "我" can be used in the singular, plural, nominative, and possessive cases. Therefore, Mr. Tong argues that I "only paid attention to the distinction between the possessive and nominative cases, but neglected the distinction between the singular and plural," and that I "did not understand pre-Qin grammar clearly" and "unfortunately failed to analyze the usage of even two or three inscription texts clearly."</p>
<p>Mr. Wang Dajin, a student at the Institute of Liberal Arts at Peking University, has researched pronouns in the Book of Documents. It was a graduate thesis from four or five years ago. The first-person pronouns he identified were similar to what Mr. Tong described, but the character "我" seemed to be used exclusively in the plural. I even offered some opinions on that thesis, so I am not likely to have forgotten that the character "我" represents the plural.</p>
<p>Here, I should first thank Mr. Tong for making me realize that my writing is not yet clear enough for even an old woman to understand, which is quite shameful. However, I also regret that Mr. Tong's intelligence has been employed in such a pointless and irrelevant discussion. The Book of Documents uses the three characters "予," "朕," and "我," but it does not use the character "吾"! According to Mr. Tong, the Stone Drums use the character "吾" and the Curse of Chu inscription uses the character "衙," which he claims is equivalent to "我." This is truly bewildering. We truly do not understand why the Stone Drums and the Curse of Chu inscriptions, since they both have the character "我," would need to write "吾" or "梧" instead. These two characters clearly derive their sound from "吾," which was anciently in the Yu rhyme group. Why not simply represent the classical character "吾" and the "慮" character in Eastern bronze inscriptions after the Spring and Autumn period, instead of representing the "我" character, which was anciently in the Ge rhyme group?</p>
<p>Shang and Zhou inscriptions use the character "我" in many places. Although Qin Gong Gui and Qin Gong Zhong do not use it, we believe it must have been in use at that time. However, the use of the character "吾" as a pronoun never appears in the Book of Documents or bronze inscriptions before the Spring and Autumn period. Therefore, we say that during such a period, only "余" (or 予), "朕," and "我" were used, and not "吾." However, in texts like the Book of Changes, the Analects, and Mencius, except when quoting ancient texts, "予," "吾," and "我" are used, and not "朕." Eastern bronze artifacts after the Spring and Autumn period, such as the Qi Jian, Huan Er Zhong, and Du Shi Hu, use "余," "慮" (or 衙), and "我," but not "朕." The boundaries here are very clear. Therefore, my original text only stated that the Qin Gong Gui era used "朕" and not "吾," and that the Stone Drums and Curse of Chu inscription eras used "吾" and not "朕." Because we have no way to prove that the Qin people first used the language "吾" and later changed it to "朕" and then back to "吾," we can only place the Stone Drums later, alongside the Curse of Chu inscription. By the time of Qin Shi Huang, the emperor referred to himself as "朕" precisely because this was an established language. Otherwise, no matter how much power Qin Shi Huang possessed, he could not have immediately banned a commonly used term!</p>
<p>Now, Mr. Tong identifies the character "吾" as "我" and also involves the question of singular and plural, which is truly "Zhang Gong drinking wine, Li Gong getting drunk." The Book of Odes clearly states "My chariots are strong, my horses are together." The Stone Drums follow this pattern but change it to "Our chariots are strong, our horses are together," which is a huge loophole. However, if we say that "吾" is equivalent to "我," a character from the Ge rhyme group that should harmonize with a sound from the Yu rhyme group, then the juxtaposition of the Stone Drums and the Curse of Chu inscription is merely for fun. Mr. Hu Shih's great work, "My Me Article," can be dispensed with, and I can do nothing about it.</p>
<p>As for the issues of the characters "沒" and "也," Mr. Tong says that the character "猗" in the Qin Oath is equivalent to "設," which is also something I do not understand. Mr. Tong also says that the character "猗" is equivalent to "兮," and the Record of Rites: Great Learning cites the Qin Oath's "猗" as "兮," which is reliable. It is only a pity that Mr. Tong contradicts himself, because "兮" is not equivalent to "也." For example, in "Uncle Xi, Uncle Xi, what long days are these!" we cannot reverse "兮" and "也." In that case, if "猗" is the same as "兮," then it has nothing to do with "也." If "也" is only the same as "毆," then why drag in "猗"? As for the Qin Feng Quan Yu, which says "Now, every meal has no remainder," I do not know when it should be dated, and the Preface to the Odes says it is satire on Duke Kang, but I do not know if that is credible. The structures of bronze inscriptions and texts on bamboo and silk are different. Bronze inscriptions are more conservative. Even if the character "也" was already in use at the time, it is possible that it was not used in bronze inscriptions. The character "也" was probably already prevalent in the Eastern states, but we only see the character "也" in the Chen Chang Dian Measure dating from the late Spring and Autumn period. This is precisely the reason. I already explained this in the Chen Chang Tao Measure Examination. The language of the Tang and Song dynasties was largely the same as it is now, but "you et al." and "we et al." are still not commonly seen in bronze inscriptions, which is a similar situation.</p>
<p>Mr. Tong says that I am "not a person who does not read books." I do not understand how to read books. If it is according to Mr. Tong's statement, "殹" is equivalent to "猗," and "猗" is equivalent to "兮," so "隊" is equivalent to "兮." I have certainly not read books in this way, and I do not deign to read them. (Zhu Junsheng, because the two characters "兮" and "也" in Mao's Odes are sometimes interchanged in other books, considers them to be interchangeable. Then, why do we not write all of the "兮" characters in Mao's Odes and the Songs of Chu as "也," or write all of the "也" characters as "兮"? The ancients were very clear about the boundaries of the characters they used. In sentences where "兮" and "也" appear together, it is clear that they are not interchangeable. The Book of Odes uses the character "維," and the Book of Documents uses the character "惟." The ancients were very clear about the boundaries of the characters they used. Ancient people often made mistakes when copying books, and the differences of one or two characters are not sufficient evidence. Zhu broke this boundary, and is truly misleading the people.)</p>
<p>Mr. Tong repeatedly says that I am "arbitrary" and also repeatedly says that I have "been poisoned by the current most fashionable trend of only asking about artifacts and not asking about documents." I do not want to accept the words "arbitrary." If I am making strict comparisons of the writing or grammar between materials from different sources, such as a carved stone written and engraved by the people of the time and things that have been copied down by many people from different times and regions, then I must admit that my method is flawed. Now I only use "bronze inscriptions," only "bronze inscriptions from the Qin state" for comparison. The difference in time is only a few hundred years, and I do not believe that this method is wrong. Mozi separated bronze and stone from bamboo and silk, and the Qin Second Emperor's edict referred to bronze and stone inscriptions together. Therefore, what was carved on carved stones was also carved on weights and measures, which shows that bronze inscriptions form a system of their own. For example, if ancient books use "予" to falsely claim that the former kings themselves acknowledged it, which is equivalent to the "余" character in bronze inscriptions, then it is equivalent to saying that bronze inscriptions do not use the "予" character. Is this "arbitrary"? In my original text, I said, "The bronze inscriptions of the Two Zhou Dynasties do not use the character '予,' and the radical for the character '迂' in the Stone Drums comes from '予.'" I never thought that it would involve the character "予" used as a pronoun in ancient books, because that is written as "余" in bronze inscriptions. What I was talking about was just the shape of the character, so I used "radical" as proof. Mr. Tong probably did not see my words clearly, and mixed the two together, thinking that I believed that the pronoun "予" or "余" was later in origin, so he said that "it is inevitable that there is some arbitrariness."</p>
<p>As for whether I have been poisoned or not, I do not want to argue, because people who have been poisoned may not know it themselves. However, I do hope that I have been poisoned by the "seeking truth from facts." One must "analyze" the usage of a character "clearly" and "understand" "pre-Qin grammar" "clearly," and not identify A as B, or A as A, and drag in things from all over the place and lump all the materials together, materials that are not necessarily equal.</p>
<p>"辟," "殺," and "迂" are the basis of my textual research on the Stone Drums era. As long as we think about it calmly, right and wrong are not difficult to determine. These are all very clear and certain pieces of evidence. Before they were brought up, one could go for thousands of years without realizing it, but once you paid attention, even I myself laughed. How could such obvious and straightforward facts be confused for twenty or thirty years? Now, this is a premise. If I have not been "arbitrary" in anything, then the Stone Drums must be placed after Duke Jing. Otherwise, everything I have said is nonsense, so I do not need to answer Mr. Tong's other comments.</p>
<h3 id="e165">Origins of Dice Research <a href="#e165" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c165" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">165</a></h3>
<p>— Chang Renxia</p>
<p>I have previously published a study on the origins of Chinese chess in India, leading me to believe that Chinese dice also have Indian connections. Dice are small, six-sided cuboid recreational tools made of ivory, bone, or other materials. They are used for gambling games in many countries around the world, including China. According to Thomas Hyde, the origin of dice should be traced back to the evolution of knuckle bones. Ancient records also mention a game using pebbles, tossing them to get odd or even numbers, which should have developed alongside dice as a toy. Dice have six sides, marked with one to six dots, and are usually played by two or more people. Each set can have up to six dice, but commonly two or three are used, with two being the most frequent.</p>
<p>The game of dice likely originated in Eastern Asia. A clay die dating back to 2750 BC was discovered in Mesopotamia. A red pottery die was also found in Rajagriha, Central India, and is currently held by Ajit Ghoce, an archaeological collector in Calcutta, India. Rajagriha was the ancient capital of the Kingdom of Magadha in the 6th and 7th centuries BC before the birth of Buddha. Furthermore, Mr. Lin Xianxiang discovered stone axes from the Stone Age there. Therefore, although the exact context of the die's discovery is unclear, it is likely about 2600-2700 years old. (When the monk Faxian visited Rajagriha during the Jin Dynasty, it had already become a desolate ruin.) In addition, the Smithsonian Institution also holds three ancient dice: one from ancient Egypt and two from ancient Rome. All are completely similar to modern Chinese and Indian dice. The Western term for dice is "Dice," which is quite similar in pronunciation to the Chinese name. In ancient Greece, dice were a very common recreational toy. The ancient Greeks called them "Tec ares," and the ancient Romans called them "Teseerae," from the Latin "Tescera," which originated from the ancient Greek. Its original meaning was "four," because it represented something that was cuboid.</p>
<p>The ancient Romans were very fond of this type of entertainment. Mark Antony spent his days throwing dice in Alexandria. Emperor Augustus, Nero, and Claudius were also avid enthusiasts. Claudius even wrote a book about the game of dice. Caligula was a notoriously degenerate dice player. Domitian also enjoyed playing dice, and Commodus even built a special room in his palace for playing dice. Emperor Verus, the adopted son of Antoninus, was known to gamble all night throwing dice. These facts are documented in ancient texts. Moreover, the dice excavated from ancient tombs today prove that these are not fabrications.</p>
<p>Dice are depicted on surviving buildings in ancient Egypt, which were discovered in Thebes. This alone allows us to clearly understand the state of dice playing in ancient times. This dice game was very common in ancient Greece and Rome. As for the inventor of dice, it is attributed to Palamedes, who lived around 1244 BC. This Greek taught his countrymen the game during the siege of Troy. He was later offered as a sacrifice on the altar of the temple of fate. Today, we infer from ancient relics that gambling with dice may have existed even earlier.</p>
<p>Dice were found in ancient relics in Rajagriha, India, and are also mentioned in the ancient hymn collection Rigveda. This book dates back to 2000 BC, meaning dice have a 4000-year history in India. Another book from the 8th century BC, Upanisad, also mentions dice, calling them Aksa. The famous ancient Indian epic Mahabharata mentions a prince who lost everything by gambling with dice. Even today, dice are a very common gambling tool in India. Tibetans and Nepalese are also very fond of it. I saw them gambling with dice in large gatherings when traveling in Darjeeling in the Himalayas. According to the Encyclopaedia Britannica, this tool originated in Asia. Although it cannot be definitively stated that India is its earliest place of origin, it is certain that dice were popular in ancient India.</p>
<p>According to Chinese legend, Lao Tzu invented dice. The "Jiushi Zhenbian," published in the first year of Daoguang (1821), states that Lao Tzu saw the Miao people idle every day when he visited the Miao region, so he taught them the game of dice. Although "Jiushi Zhenbian" is not a very ancient book, this legend is based on something. The "Taiping Yulan," volume 726, quotes "Bowu Zhi" as saying that Lao Tzu entered the Western Rong tribe and taught them Hao Pu, which is the same source as this legend. However, Hao Pu is different from modern dice, which we should always be aware of. As for the earliest discovered Chinese dice, they are of a different kind and unlike the dice known in Europe and India. According to a letter from my friend Wei Juxian, Mr. Shang Chengzu once bought a stone die about one square inch in size in Beijing. It had fourteen sides, while modern dice have six sides. The fourteen sides were formed by removing eight corners from the cube. It was engraved with characters instead of dots. The characters were one, two, three, three, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, twenty, thirty, blank, a total of thirteen numbers, and one side was blank. The rules of the game are unknown. I have not seen the original object in Xiyong, but based on Wei Juxian's description, this die should be very ancient, with characters similar to those on oracle bones from the Yin Ruins. Seven was written as ten, and ten was written as a dash, as was the case in oracle bone script. This type of die was called "Qiong" in ancient China, named because it was made of jade or stone. Throwing Qiong to gamble was similar to throwing dice before gambling with dominoes or playing mahjong today. The "Liubo," "Wu Mu," "Hu Zhi He Lu," "Lou Pu," "Liu Zhu," and "Bo Sai" mentioned in ancient Chinese documents did not use modern dice, which I can prove separately. However, the northerners call playing dice "Shai Zi," which is a continuation of the ancient Chinese name. In ancient porcelain from the Six Dynasties period, a die about one square inch in size was found, completely identical to the dice excavated from ancient Egyptian and ancient Roman tombs, as well as modern Indian dice. This die was formerly owned by Professor Li Chaoshi of the National Academy of Art, who said he obtained it from Yuyao, Zhejiang, also from an ancient tomb. It is now in the collection of Wei Juxian. This is the earliest Chinese die of the same type as ancient Egyptian dice that I know of.</p>
<p>The development of dice into dominoes is a unique Chinese innovation. The dots on the two faces of a die are combined to form a domino. Through intricate combinations, thirty-two dominoes are formed. Dice can be said to be the foundation of dominoes. If there were no dice first, there would be no dominoes later. The custom of using dominoes for divination is very popular in Chinese folk culture. Originally, using cards for divination existed in many parts of the world. Before dice were used for gambling, they may have also been used for divination, similar to tossing heads or tails with a coin. The Chinese Liuren divination method uses three coins to cast divination, shaking them in a box, which is completely similar to the method of using dice. The origin is likely the same.</p>
<p>Chinese Yezi cards are another type of gambling tool besides dice. Today's mahjong tiles evolved from Yezi cards. They resemble dominoes but are not actually dominoes. According to Dr. Hu Shi's Mount Lu travelogue, he collected Yezi cards from various places, which will allow his penchant for research to trace the roots. (January 1947, Visva-Bharati University, India).</p>
<p>The Smithsonian Institution holds three ancient dice, 1 from an Egyptian tomb, 2 and 3 from Roman tombs, sketched by the author.</p>
<h3 id="e166">Postscript to "A Chronological Biography of Shen Kuo" <a href="#e166" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c166" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">166</a></h3>
<p>— Xu Gui</p>
<p>(A Chronological Biography of Shen Kuo, written by Professor Zhang Yinlin, published in the Tsinghua Journal, Volume 11, Number 2, April 1926. It has been included in the posthumous work "Essays on the History of the Song Dynasty.")</p>
<p>According to the biography of Shen Kuo in the History of the Song Dynasty, "In the early years of Yuan祐 (1086-1093), he was transferred to Xiuzhou." Also, the "Letter of Thanks for Being Demoted and Appointed as the Deputy Commander of the Xiuzhou Military Training" in the Changxing Collection, volume 16, says: "I have been ordered to serve as the Deputy Commander of the Xiuzhou Military Training, stationed in this prefecture." It is known that Shen Kuo could not leave Xiuzhou before receiving the new order. In Professor Yinlin's original article, the entry for the fourth year of Yuan祐 states: "Kuo's move to Mengxi, Jingkou, must have been after he presented the map and received the award, and was granted permission to reside at his convenience." According to the "Continuation of Zizhi Tongjian Changbian" by Li Tao, entry for the Bingzi day (3rd day) of the eighth month of the third year of Yuan祐 (1088): "Shen Kuo, the Deputy Commander of the Xiuzhou Military Training, stationed in this prefecture and not allowed to sign official documents, was granted 100 bolts of silk and allowed to reside at his convenience, because Kuo presented the map of all prefectures and counties in the country." This matter is also found in the "Collected Drafts of the Song Huiyao," Penal Law 6, entry 20, but it is dated the 13th day of the eighth month. It can be seen that the presentation of the map and the award occurred in the third year of Yuan祐, not the fourth year. Also, the so-called "allowed to reside at his convenience" refers to being allowed to reside at his convenience within the territory of Xiuzhou, not being allowed to reside at his convenience in prefectures and armies outside of Xiuzhou. Also, the "Letter of Thanks for Being Appointed as a Secretary of Nanjing" in the Changxing Collection, volume 16, says: "On the 19th of this month, a messenger from Runzhou delivered an official notice, granting me the grace to be appointed as the Left Chao San Lang, guarding the Guanglu Shaoqing, Secretary of Nanjing, and allowing me to reside at my convenience in prefectures and armies outside of Nanjing." The Changbian records this decree on the Wuxu day (7th day) of the tenth month of the fifth year of Yuan祐 (1090). Being allowed to reside at his convenience in prefectures and armies outside of Nanjing meant that he could also reside outside of Nanjing. This is important evidence that his actions were now free. Assuming that he moved to Runzhou immediately after receiving the new order in the tenth month of the fifth year of Yuan祐, then the statement in the History of the Song Dynasty that "He lived in Runzhou for eight years and died at the age of sixty-five" should be calculated from the fifth year of Yuan祐 (1090), and after eight years, it would be the fourth year of Shaoxing (1097). If he died in the fourth year of Shaosheng (1097) at the age of sixty-five, then his year of birth would be the second year of Mingdao (1033), which does not match the original article stating that he was born in the first year of Mingdao (1032). Whether he moved to Runzhou in the fifth or sixth year of Yuan祐 is not certain, but it was definitely not before the tenth month of the fifth year of Yuan祐. Based on this, it is clear that Shen Kuo was not born in the first year of Mingdao, but after the first year of Mingdao. Unless the original text of the History of the Song Dynasty is incorrect.</p>
<p>Also, the entry for the Jichou day (22nd day) of the ninth month of the fourth year of Yuan祐 (1089) in the Changbian states: "Shao was ordered to be demoted to the Deputy Commander of the Xiuzhou Military Training and stationed in Huangzhou. Shen Kuo was given the title of Chao San Lang, Guanglu Shaoqing, and was ordered to be demoted to the Deputy Commander of the Chengzhou Military Training and stationed in Huangzhou. Wu Juhou was given the title of Chao Feng Lang, Shaofu Shaojian, and both were appointed as Secretaries of Nanjing; (omitted) and both were allowed to reside at their convenience in prefectures and armies outside of Nanjing." This order was soon opposed by Liang Tao and Liu Anshi, so the same day there was an edict stating that Shao's "previous orders for Shen Kuo and Wu Juhou should not be carried out, and Shen Kuo should wait for further instructions." But one point to note is that before the Jichou day of the ninth month of the fourth year of Yuan祐, Shen Kuo had already moved to Huangzhou. As for the statement in the "Letter of Thanks for Being Appointed as a Secretary of Nanjing" that a messenger from Runzhou delivered the official notice, many people believe that Shen Kuo had already chosen to live in Runzhou before receiving the official notice, seemingly without noticing that "being allowed to reside at his convenience in prefectures and armies outside of Nanjing" was an important order that confirmed his freedom of action. It should be known that restricting residence is a kind of punishment, and not restricting residence is the removal of this kind of punishment, and there must be an explicit order to obtain freedom of action. The reason why the "Letter of Thanks" pointed out Runzhou was probably because Runzhou was an important hub for water transportation at the time, and some documents used it as a starting point for transportation.</p>
<h3 id="e167">Reading "Postscript to A Chronological Biography of Shen Kuo" <a href="#e167" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c167" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">167</a></h3>
<p>— Ding Zeliang</p>
<p>Recently, the editorial department of the Wen Shi Zhoukan (Literary and Historical Weekly) forwarded me a letter from Mr. Xu Gui of Zhejiang University and his article "Postscript to A Chronological Biography of Shen Kuo." I would like to express my admiration for Mr. Xu's enthusiasm for correction and thank the editors of Wen Shi Zhoukan. Mr. Xu's opinion on the question of Shen Kuo's birth and death years differs from mine in "A Study of Shen Kuo's Birth and Death Years" (published in the Shanghai Ta Kung Pao and Wen Shi Zhoukan, issue 29). The main difference is that Mr. Xu believes that Shen Kuo lived in Runzhou starting in the fifth year of Yuan祐, while I believe it started between the ninth and twelfth months of the fourth year of Yuan祐. In fact, I used to hold the same view as Mr. Xu. On the fifth issue of the Chongqing edition of the Yishibao Shixue Fukan (Yishibao Historical Studies Supplement), published on May 30, 1940, I wrote an article titled "Postscript to A Chronological Biography of Shen Kuo." Regarding Shen Kuo's birth and death years, my conclusion was the same as Mr. Xu's now. I said:</p>
<p>"After Kuo's demotion in Yuanfeng, he was truly allowed to reside at his convenience in the tenth month of the fifth year of Yuan祐. His move to Jingkou (i.e., Runzhou) should also be in this year. Counting eight years of living in Runzhou, he should have died in the fourth year of Shaosheng, and his year of birth was in the second year of Mingdao (1033-1097 AD). The deeds of Shen compiled by Zhang (Yinlin) are all one year earlier."</p>
<p>Not only is the conclusion the same, but the argument used is also the same, namely, the entry for the Wuxu day of the seventh month of the tenth year of Yuan祐 in volume 449 of the Changbian. I had shown that small article to Mr. Zhang, and Mr. Zhang had added a note to the article, expressing his agreement with my conclusion. Later, my opinion changed, and I also wrote to Mr. Zhang at Zhejiang University to inform him, and presented the arguments one by one. Mr. Zhang replied, also considering this new opinion to be reasonable. The recent article "A Study of Shen Kuo's Birth and Death Years" was written based on this revised opinion.</p>
<p>Why did I change to a new opinion? The various arguments used in "A Study of Shen Kuo's Birth and Death Years" can serve as an explanation, so I will not repeat them here. Regarding Mr. Xu's opinion, I would like to raise three points of doubt for discussion. According to the "Letter of Thanks for Being Appointed as a Secretary of Nanjing" in volume 16 of the Changxing Collection, "A messenger from Runzhou delivered an official notice," etc., seems to imply that Shen Kuo was already living in Runzhou at this time (before the tenth month of the fifth year of Yuan祐). There is no shortage of coincidences, but if Shen Kuo did not live in Runzhou at this time, and the official notice was delivered by a messenger from Runzhou, and after Shen Kuo received it, he lived in Runzhou, wouldn't that be too much of a coincidence? This is the first point. If he was not in Runzhou at this time, but in Huangzhou, Huangzhou and Runzhou are far apart. Why didn't the government document directly send it to Huangzhou and have it sent by a messenger from Huangzhou, but instead sent a messenger from Runzhou from thousands of miles away? This is very puzzling. This is the second point. Mr. Xu said that Runzhou was "an important hub for water transportation at the time, and some documents used it as a starting point for transportation." I don't know if this statement has any basis? If other examples can be cited besides this one to prove that the Northern Song Dynasty did have a method of using Runzhou as a starting point for transporting documents, this conclusion may be valid. This is the third point.</p>
<p>I feel that the question of Shen Kuo's birth and death years is difficult to draw a definitive conclusion because the existing historical materials are limited and the wording is vague. Saying that he lived in Runzhou after the ninth month of the fourth year of Yuan祐 does not fully conform to the imperial edict of the Wuxu day of the tenth month of the fifth year of Yuan祐. Saying that he did not live in Runzhou until after the tenth month of the fifth year of Yuan祐, but the official notice was delivered by a messenger from Runzhou. Both views have difficulties. I am not satisfied with my opinion now, and I hope that Mr. Xu and those who study the history of the Song Dynasty can teach me. 36, 6, 9, Tsinghua Garden</p>

<h3 id="e171">On Waste <a href="#e171" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c171" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">171</a></h3>
<p>— Ji Yong</p>
<p>In China, waste is necessary, which is very different from other countries. Americans value efficiency. Restaurants require "self-service," and ticket purchases on trams, food purchases in candy stores, and everything else that can be managed by a nickel or a dime to replace a living person, is mainly to save the strength of living people. They do not save manpower to eat, drink, play, and kill boring time, but have greater and more important work for people to do. But this does not work in China. China lacks machines, but has a surplus of manpower. Once manpower is replaced by machines, they will lose their jobs, to the point of hunger and cold, and further to rebellion and banditry. Therefore, when foreign devils wanted to build railways in China, the censor officials of the previous Qing Dynasty submitted memorials, believing that this would cause unemployment and create the root of chaos, something that should never be allowed. The Songhu Railway, built by the British in the early years of Tongzhi, was thus forced to stop, and the Chinese government redeemed it for more than 200,000 taels of silver and sank it in the bay.</p>
<p>Can you say this is stubborn? The Qing Dynasty really lost the country due to railway disputes. The Eight-Nation Alliance really marched triumphantly to Beijing along the Beijing-Tianjin Railway. Even before the July 7th Incident, the Beining Railway was still the main artery for Japanese troop transport. Such railways sometimes simply make people feel that "it is better to have none!" As for the civil wars during the warlord era, it goes without saying that the people along the railway line suffered completely. The railway is like this, and looking at the so-called government agencies, since the late Qing Dynasty, there has been talk of cutting redundancies, and it has been nearly a hundred years, but redundancies are still cut endlessly. Last winter, the Executive Yuan even allocated quotas, ordering various agencies to cut according to the quotas. In fact, this method should also be considered, because although there are not many talented people in China, there are quite a few mediocre people. These people have finally found a job in large and small agencies with great effort. Once they are cut, how many hungry and cold people will be added? - Even if some plan is realized one day, these "disaster officials" who only copy precedents will be useless. Therefore, many things cannot be suddenly reformed. Official documents cannot reduce several bends and stops. Drawing, requesting, drafting, and approving cannot reduce several "seals." Government agencies cannot order fewer newspapers to provide these people with boring pastimes, and at the same time, they cannot have more tea rooms for service and to fund official factions. As for the expenses of paper cigarettes, tea, etc., they are additional prosperity. If you really cut the Gordian knot and thoroughly reform, how many people do you think will be involved? This unrest is much greater than spending more government expenses each month or delaying public affairs for a certain amount of time. "Those who plan for the country must be cautious!" The ancients said, choose the lesser of two evils, so we might as well say that in Chinese society, doing things with waste is the first priority, and efficiency is a miscalculation. If you don't believe it, look, because the dance halls that specialize in wasting manpower and time have been knocked down, causing such a big dispute. Alas, how can waste be easily prohibited!</p>
<p>What is even worse is that people who do not advocate waste sometimes feel that it is very correct, at least it will not cause any harm to themselves, but there will be exceptions. Recently, reading "Liang Yansun's Chronicle," it is said that in the first year of Xuantong (1909), Yuan Shikai was dismissed because he disagreed with the Prince Regent, and the transport department officials were affected, including Chen Biwen, the minister of posts and communications:</p>
<p>"Soon, Censor Xie Yuanhan submitted a memorial</p>
<p>Impeaching Chen, the Minister of Posts and Communications, for many crimes, involving Mr. Liang and many members of the ministry (Mr. Liang refers to Liang Yansun, then the director of the Railway Administration), because he was instructed by a certain official in power, and also entrusted by those who were dissatisfied with the Ministry of Posts and Communications. At that time, a certain official in power wanted to overthrow Chen to isolate Yuan's power, and also to avenge a certain Duke who was the former director of the railway (referring to Sheng Xuanhuai). He was overjoyed and drafted an edict ordering Grand Scholar Sun Jia Nai Xiang to investigate. The two understood everything, and thoroughly checked the accounts, but found nothing wrong. They were about to truthfully report back, when Yuan Shikai was dismissed. Chen also lost the favor of Empress Dowager Yuta and the Prince Regent due to two matters: the Chongling project and the Prince Regent's residence [Original note: Minister Chen has been in charge of major projects and is known for his precision. Therefore, he was appointed as the Minister of the Chongling Project. According to custom, only about 30% of such major projects are completed, and the rest are used to bribe officials and distribute profits. Minister Chen consulted with the other two ministers of the same faction and estimated the amount of money. The two estimated 12 million taels, but Chen said that he could use 7 million taels if he did it himself. The two were silent, and then they dismissed the discussion. A few days later, an edict was issued: 'Chen does not need to be the Minister of the Chongling Project!' It was heard that someone had spread rumors, saying, 'The late emperor (Guangxu) suffered for a lifetime, and Chen Bi still wants to be stingy with him when he is buried!' Longyu (Guangxu's empress) heard this, and was heartbroken, and insisted on dismissing Chen. Just in time, the Prince Regent wanted to find a place to build a mansion, and someone deliberately told him that the location of the Ministry of Posts and Communications was excellent, but Minister Chen did not want to give it up. The Prince Regent was furious, and the two matters converged, and Sun and Nai could not avoid convicting Chen even if they wanted to! ] Because of the written charges, he was impeached. Minister Chen was handed over to the ministry for deliberation and was dismissed, and the members of the ministry were demoted or dismissed to varying degrees…"</p>
<p>Chen wanted not to waste, but as a result, he not only lost his official position, but his colleagues also suffered because of it. Isn't this a lesson from the past? From this we know that perhaps we usually scold officials for corruption, which may be a injustice. At least the motive is not entirely personal, but there must be a reason why "it must be so." Since this is the case, isn't waste efficiency in China, and isn't efficiency waste?</p>
<p>This is naturally a fallacy, please forgive me. (Editor's note: When the American hydraulic engineering expert Todd came to China to supervise the Yellow River embankment restoration project, I once asked him why he did not build a light railway to save time. Todd said sternly: For this kind of project, the more manpower wasted, the better. It is for the sake of providing work relief, and the more people who receive relief, the better. I was greatly moved by this, and Todd laughed at me.)</p>
<h3 id="e172">Super Long Distance Call <a href="#e172" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c172" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">172</a></h3>
<p>The last International Transportation Conference was held in Moscow. After the meeting, a representative from an American telephone and telegraph company prepared to return home via Berlin. However, the Soviet plane that was to take him could only land in the Soviet-occupied zone of Germany, and that airfield was 25 miles from the American-occupied zone.</p>
<p>The American representative wanted to make a phone call to Berlin to request that the American side send a car to pick him up at the airfield, but the only telephone line at the Soviet airfield that could connect to Berlin was a military line.</p>
<p>However, as the saying goes, heaven never seals off all exits. Fortunately, the airfield did have long-distance telephone equipment connecting to the United States. Therefore, the American representative first made a phone call to the New York long-distance telephone station, and then the New York station made a long-distance call to the telephone company's person in charge in Berlin, asking him to send a car to the airfield. These several long-distance calls traveled back and forth a distance of nine thousand miles, creating a new record for a "calling-for-a-car phone call." (Ping)</p>
<h3 id="e173">Spring Outing <a href="#e173" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c173" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">173</a></h3>
<p>— He Ku</p>
<p>"Reading ten thousand books is not as good as traveling ten thousand miles." The ancients have already said that going on an outing is better than merely reading books. Shanghai is a commercial city. From a purely profit-oriented perspective, traveling ten thousand miles can even more result in a rewarding harvest. During the war, many people did not hesitate to shoulder burdens and were willing to endure enemy stabs, insults, and scoldings, moving back and forth on the Nanjing-Shanghai-Hangzhou railway line, engaging in the traveling profession - the "single-carrier" - precisely because traversing the roads could yield extremely high profits.</p>
<p>After the victory, even bigger "single-carriers" appeared, taking "Air Overlords" to Beiping, merchant ships of the China Merchants Bureau to Taiwan, or hitching rides on President-class postal ships to Hong Kong. In addition to daily expenses being covered without spending a penny, they could also earn a substantial profit. Although this kind of "business" is not something ordinary people can do, at least one must have some background or "skill" to act appropriately. This sufficiently illustrates that traveling ten thousand miles today is a productive endeavor, quite different from the era of Xu Xiake.</p>
<p>However, this method of traveling ten thousand miles has too much of a utilitarian mindset, losing the true meaning of an outing, and is not within the scope of the spring outing discussed in this article. Our ideal spring outing should be the realm of "five or six adults with caps, six or seven children, bathing in the Yi River, enjoying the breeze on the dance altar, and returning singing." As for whether the spring clothes are ready or not, that need not be considered. In fact, frequent travelers do not wear military uniforms, let alone the fact that making a set of spring clothes now costs too much. Making spring clothes for the sake of going on an outing is even more than what we can afford. Some friends are already starting to tailor summer gabardine suits for themselves, buying materials and tailoring. A summer suit costs more than fifteen million yuan, which is terrifying to hear. Moreover, according to their plans, our spring clothes should have been planned last fall. Since we did not plan in advance, it is better to be content with what we have. Even if it's just a set of old clothes, we can sit anywhere, whether on a mound, by a rock crevice, or by a lake shore. If it's brand new clothes, it will only burden you, making you a slave to clothing, which is hardly worthwhile.</p>
<p>The second condition for a spring outing is to have good weather. On the day we decide to go out, we may feel that rain doesn't matter because we are in good spirits, but rain is ultimately a spoilsport. From my own experience, once I went to Hangzhou, the weather was very good on the first and second days. The bright sunshine shone on the nearby water and distant mountains, creating a joyous atmosphere. On the third day, it was gloomy and rainy. Only four of us tourists were left climbing Baochu Pagoda, and we couldn't help but feel a gloomy loneliness. Looking at the lake view from afar, it was covered in fog, like looking at a street scene through frosted glass. You can probably imagine how unpleasant it was. Because most tourists like bright colors, the scenery in the countryside is sure to be bright and picturesque on warm and sunny days.</p>
<p>The first time I visited Hangzhou was during my school days. To cover the expenses, I first wrote a letter to ask for my father's consent. My father replied with absolute agreement, and at the end of the letter, he mentioned that he himself "hated being stuck at home every year, failing to appreciate this wonderful spring scenery." Now it is my turn to be stuck at home every year, so every year's wonderful spring scenery is "hated." Therefore, the most important, though not the least, condition for spring outings is having free time. There are many opportunities for travel nowadays, and travel groups are springing up everywhere, but a "whirlwind tour" of only one or two days is not a true spring outing. No one in the world uses the money for buying rice and vegetables to travel. Therefore, taking advantage of one's free time to go on an outing is also an extremely difficult thing. This makes us believe that a person must have some "good fortune" to be able to talk about spring outings. And one must also find a partner who is equally fortunate as you. Having a confidant in life and traveling to beautiful mountains and rivers is an ideal state, but it is probably difficult to find even one couple among thousands of people!</p>
<p>Writing this far, I truly feel that talking about spring outings at this time and place is not only a difficult thing, but also a luxury. The more I think about it, the more difficult it becomes, so I have no choice but to stop writing.</p>
<h3 id="e174">Aiding the Hidden Poor <a href="#e174" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c174" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">174</a></h3>
<p>— Zhang Jiaoxin</p>
<p>Chen Hao, a staff member of the Municipal Finance Bureau, committed suicide by jumping into the Huangpu River because his wife had been ill for two months and he had exhausted his resources to treat her, but he could not bear to sit idly by. The Finance Bureau's colleagues, moved by compassion, launched a fundraising campaign to treat Mrs. Chen. This is a manifestation of human mutual assistance. Mencius said, "Supporting each other in sickness," which is the duty that a community should fulfill.</p>
<p>Under the circumstances of soaring prices and high living pressure, the vast majority of the impoverished masses truly feel that it is difficult to seek death and even more difficult to make a living! Ordinary laborers can still wear short clothes and rely on their physical strength to support their families, but those friends who wear long clothes only know how to wield a pen. They cannot carry loads or lift heavy objects. They have no physical strength to sell, and they are too embarrassed to take off the long clothes that represent gentility. They usually struggle and groan under the heavy pressure of life. Once they encounter illness, they find it difficult to beg for help or borrow from others for fear of being met with disdain. In this situation, death is the only way out. The ruthless whip of life drives them to the path of suicide! The most pitiful and unspeakable people in the world are this group of "hidden poor"!</p>
<p>After Mr. Chen's suicide, the Finance Bureau's colleagues raised funds to help, which is commendable! However, it is best to provide assistance before such tragedies occur, so as to eliminate them in their infancy. My suggestion is: within an organization or among relatives and friends, if there are such hidden poor, it may be worthwhile for enthusiastic people to initiate a gathering. For example, if two or three million yuan can be collected, it can be used to generate interest. In about four or five months, the principal and interest will be equal. Then, half of it can be returned to the helpers, and half can be loaned out. A portion or a large portion of the monthly interest can be withdrawn to supplement the lack of living expenses. In this way, the recipient can feel at ease after four or five months, having paid off the debt, and the helpers will only lose four or five months of interest, which is a limited loss. Under the belief that "it is most joyful to do good," it does not seem to be a difficult thing.</p>
<p>If you say that there are too many poor people now, and it is unlikely that anyone can help others, that is indeed true. However, the fundraising document of the Finance Bureau's colleagues states, "...Although we are as poor as Mr. Chen, we are still struggling and can still struggle. We should offer sympathy in spirit and assistance in material terms. The amount of money doesn't have to be much. Please do what you can..." They are originally asking everyone to "do what you can." If we can help one more person, society will have one more point of stability. Although it is called helping others, why isn't it helping oneself?</p>
<h3 id="e175">Anhydrous Food <a href="#e175" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c175" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">175</a></h3>
<p>— Xili</p>
<p>According to experts, since mankind learned to dry fruits and other things in the sun for storage, there is now a new type of food about to appear. This new product is called "Anhydrous Food". Anhydrous fruits and vegetables can retain the color, fragrance, taste, and vitamins they had when fresh. Because its water content is completely absorbed, the "bulk" of "Anhydrous Food" can all fit into a container the size of two cigarette boxes.</p>
<p>Housewives can put all the vegetables and fruits they need for a week into their handbags when they go shopping. For example, a small bag of rice-sized anhydrous potatoes, about the size of two decks of cards, can feed five people. Moreover, we can now enjoy seasonal fresh fruits all year round, because "Anhydrous Food" does not need to be refrigerated at normal temperatures and can be kept from spoiling for up to a year.</p>
<p>Another benefit of "Anhydrous Food" for housewives is that it eliminates the hassle of going to the market. A year's worth of food can be purchased all at once and stored in a medium-sized storage room. Cooking time can also be greatly reduced. "Anhydrous Food" does not need to be peeled or washed, and there are no scraps to throw away, because the pits and peels have all been removed during manufacturing.</p>
<p>Clarence Birdseye, the first person to invent quick-freezing, is the inventor of this new type of food. He recently unveiled his new contribution at a banquet in New York. Many of the experts present thought he had made a new discovery about quick-freezing. Little did they know that they were invited to eat his newly invented food. When everyone asked him how he made it, Birdseye and H. W. Roden, the manager of the American Home Foods Corporation, which produces this new product, gave a detailed explanation.</p>
<p>Birdseye used only a wok, a frying pan, and a little water to cook carrots and cauliflower in ten minutes. Then he poured a bag of anhydrous sweet potatoes onto a steamer, sprinkled it with water, and stirred it for a while, and the dish was ready. It only took four minutes from pouring out of the bag to completion.</p>
<p>Birdseye said he had successfully dehydrated spinach, onions, sweet potatoes, pumpkins, and almost all common vegetables and fruits. He believes that there is nothing that cannot be dehydrated.</p>
<p>The previous type of dehydrated food took longer to prepare than fresh food, because it had to be soaked in water for a long time before it could be cooked. The usual cooking time was one and a half hours. As for the new product, it only takes four to ten minutes. The previous food took about eighteen hours to dehydrate, while the new dehydrator can remove more water in one and a half hours.</p>
<p>"Without adding high heat, and with the water being removed so quickly, the food simply doesn't have time to change its properties," Birdseye said. "Because the water is removed quickly, it also rehydrates quickly. So when cooking, most of the nutrients, color, flavor, and taste are preserved."</p>
<p>Another advantage of dehydrated food is that it is easy to store and takes up very little space. The raw materials loaded onto nine trucks can be reduced to five trucks of old-fashioned dried fruit after dehydration. If it is further dehydrated into the new product mentioned in this article, then only one truck will be needed to load it all.</p>

<p>— Xu Banmeng</p>
<p>Dream</p>
<p>Old dreams of the Guangxu and Xuantong eras are to be relived, old broken duckweed traces no longer exist, poetry is hard to write with so much to see, Buddha is audacious to claim eminence in the void. Plum blossoms in a pot exude pure fragrance in my seat, moonlight in the woods dims, snow fills the door, I laugh at my accustomed decadence, passing the day and night in utter boredom.</p>
<p>Feeling</p>
<p>Who built the Golden Terrace of King Zhao, seeking worthy men to rise up as talents, the great land and rivers are to be restored, the long sky filled with wind and rain. My heart follows the wild geese across a thousand broken mountains, my dreams chase the crying apes in myriad laments. I do not believe there are nameless men by the vast sea, a single hammer at Bolang unexpectedly causing thunder.</p>
<p>Sitting Quietly</p>
<p>Sitting quietly in an empty hall, forgetting all thoughts, leisurely facing each other, talking about sorrow and desolation, although the setting sun is beautiful, dusk is near, bright and sharp youth is merciless, white hair is gray. Facing this vastness, a hundred feelings arise, because people are busy for a thousand fields. The spiritual brush has a transcendental place, cleanse the roots and tease the old hometown.</p>
<p>Upstream</p>
<p>Wanting to turn heaven and earth into flying pavilions, the water stirs the clouds, connecting to heal upstream, ten thousand miles of mountains and rivers unfold like brocade, gales from all directions, dragons stir. Eastern scales and Western claws gathered to form a battle array, Northern darkness and Southern boats, the moon serves as a fishing weir, looking back at the layered city, leaning in the distant, pupils viewing the dawn sun below the yellow bull.</p>
<p>Feeling the Times</p>
<p>Heroes boast of carving up territory, fortune fills long banners, in chaotic times, years are forgotten, in poverty, people disregard life and death. The Central Plains is still suffering from war, the outer seas have not ceased fighting. To whom does Heaven's will belong? The remaining chess pieces are still battling.</p>
<p>Coldness fills the Lan River, solitary chanting is gladdened by a friend's passing, tears fall from thinking of my younger brother, dreams are filled with thoughts of home. Chaos lingers, still with beacon fires, this year, I still whistle and sing. A round moon before the window, is illuminating the night.</p>
<h3 id="e177">Humble Suggestions for Beautifying Zhongzheng Park <a href="#e177" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c177" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">177</a></h3>
<p>— Liu Rong</p>
<p>Shanghai, as an international metropolis, is frequented by both Chinese and foreigners. All municipal facilities should naturally adhere to modernization as a standard. Not only should public utilities such as transportation, water, electricity, medicine, and hygiene be complete and free from concerns of inadequacy, but also places that cultivate noble sentiments in citizens and nurture excellent character in the public, such as parks, should especially be beautified to possess the tranquility of urban mountains and forests. Thus, citizens bustling and striving for fame and gain in life may have a chance to step into the gardens, wash away the dust and vulgarity, clarify their minds, and restore their inherent goodness. Since arriving in Shanghai, I have visited all the parks in the past two years. Although each has its own style, I feel that their layout and management have not fully met the ideal. Now, I will focus on Zhongzheng Park, which is the closest to my residence, the most frequently visited, the most familiar, and the most deeply felt.</p>
<p>Zhongzheng Park is located in Hongkou, with spacious grounds and a quiet environment. It is a pity that the park's layout is very simple, with everything visible at a glance, lacking the charm of a garden. In the park, apart from a few flower beds of miscellaneous plants in the square at the entrance (even these are currently missing), there is a straw pavilion in the left corner of the park, and a monument to the war dead of the Songhu-Hangzhou battle in the north corner of the park. In addition, there are only two half-acre ponds, one clear enough to reflect people, one planted with lotus roots, where one can see the wind on the water surface and smell the fragrance of lotus flowers in the height of summer. But when the spring breeze first stirs and new green has not yet emerged, the park is filled with a view of nothing but withered grass and weeds, which evokes only sorrow and sighs, let alone cultivating emotions and nurturing character. Can this be called a park? Can this be called recreation? The park lacks peach and plum blossoms in spring, pomegranate and palm trees in summer (fortunately, there are water caltrops and lotus, which are barely satisfactory), osmanthus and chrysanthemums in autumn, and plum and bamboo in winter. The scenery of the four seasons is incomplete, and there are no pavilions or buildings. It lacks the charm of winding paths leading to secluded spots and is short of lush flowers and trees. It has no shade in summer and no veranda in winter. It truly lacks everything and has nothing. To build a park out of stone, one can invite clouds, plant bananas to invite rain, plant bamboos to invite wind, strike the pond to ward off the moon, plant flowers to invite butterflies... Turning the ordinary into the magical depends on the ingenuity of the designer. Now the park is barren, like a leper with a bald head, like Xishi with a soiled body. It is truly a pity!</p>
<p>In modern times, with the development of science, horticulture has become a specialized discipline, and flowers and landscaping are among its specialized subjects. Given the size of our country and the recent promotion of agriculture, the establishment of agricultural vocational schools and the dispatch of personnel to the United States for internships, there is no shortage of landscaping talents. Why not employ them to beautify this park, which is related to the welfare of more than four million citizens? Wouldn't that be great?</p>
<p>Someone may say: This problem is not necessarily that simple. Every municipal construction project inevitably involves the issue of funding. This is not necessarily the case. The municipal budget already includes an item for park management expenses, and the proportion of expenses required is actually minimal. I do not know what the current organization of park management is and what the source of funding is. But seeing that there are people collecting tickets at the park entrance and that there are people living in the park, it is probably not entirely a matter of neglect. And seeing that there is no layout or facilities in the park, leaving it to be overgrown with weeds, it seems that no one is responsible for it. Is it not an easy thing to plant a tree in the spring and a flower in the autumn? Does it also require expense limitations? Now, try stepping into the park, how many trees are there? Is there a flower? I truly cannot understand it. Is it really the case that "everyone neglects the public water buffalo"? Does everything involving "public" and "government" have to be a mess? How sad! In the past, when Zeng Guofan restored Jinling, he did not forget to rebuild the Qinhuai River. And Zheng Banqiao lamented over "a scene of joy, overgrown with weeds." He believed that it was related to the rise and fall of the country throughout the ages. Seeing the subtle and knowing the obvious, it can truly verify the prosperity or decline of the country. Moreover, this park is a place to "guide the people with righteousness," and its significance is even more profound!</p>
<p>Spring returns to the earth, and everything is reviving. It is the time to plant trees and flowers. Having seen this, I hereby draft this article to urge the relevant authorities and people in society to pay attention, and also to represent the voice of a part of the citizens. As for how to build a beautiful, complete, and ideal park, that is the business of experts. Those who are in charge should not overstep their bounds.</p>

<p>— Tian Zibing</p>
<p>Dreams are like mysterious messengers, weaving the remnants of daily life into beautiful stories, as beautiful as poetry. They often give people many strange imaginings, pain and joy. Dreams and art are most closely related.</p>
<p>Many artistic creations are often related to dreams. In Xu Ci, it is said that Qin Guan's "Good Deeds Near" was composed in a dream. Yuan Zhen's "Liangzhou Dream," Lu You's "Night Tour Palace," and Liu Kezhuang's "Qinyuan Spring" were all written to record dreams. Millet often took the scenes he felt during the day, meditated on them in the evening, and produced good paintings the next day. The musician Tartini's "Devil's Trill Sonata" was based on a melody the devil played to him in a dream. Goethe also said that in a dream, one could dream of the lives of the characters in the works one thought of during the day. It is said that Shi Xiu painted the portraits of the Sixteen Arhats after having a dream every night and then painting it when he woke up. (This picture is in the Holy Cause Temple in West Lake, now the West Lake Museum.)</p>
<p>When we appreciate a good work of art, our minds often wander and merge with the art. Life is indeed like a dream, but today, with so much devastation, so many beautiful dreams have been shattered, and so many life's blueprints have been stained.</p>

<p>— Chen Shenyan</p>
<p>Full of Doubts (Eight and Nine)</p>
<p>As soon as Zhongjie heard that it was Qiyun's brother, he thought that with her brother on the scene, it would be difficult to explain if he resorted to violence again. He blurted out: "You ganged up to deceive me! I'm giving you a deadline to leave this place today. If you don't leave, I'll send people to catch you. Be careful!" With that, he put his gun in his pocket and stormed downstairs. Qiyun was originally prepared to sacrifice herself and fight Zhongjie, but as soon as Zhongjie left, her courage flagged. Facing Xiaohe, she felt very ashamed and couldn't say a word. She turned and ran to the bed, crying loudly. Xiaohe walked over and said: "Sister, you're too inexperienced! How could you associate with this kind of person! This kind of person has ruined so many people. Now everyone knows about it. How can I face my friends? Qiyun, seeing that Xiaohe was also blaming her, felt very wronged and couldn't explain herself for a moment. She just sobbed and cried. Xiaohe took out a newspaper from his arms and said: "Have you seen the news in today's paper?" Qiyun said: "Don't mention it! I know everything. I didn't expect this kind of person to be so unreasonable. I admit I'm unlucky. There's nothing to say. You don't need to nag me anymore!" Xiaohe said: "I'm not meddling. According to what's published in today's paper, it really has a lot to do with our reputation. You have to pay attention. Our father was very particular about family status. Now that this has happened, how can we face our dead father? You're too willful in everything. You think you can control everyone with your temper. You've been taken advantage of today. If I hadn't come in, you might have lost your life!" Qiyun said: "I didn't want you to come in. I'd rather die. What's the point of living?" Xiaohe said: "Sister, even if you die, your reputation will be ruined. I won't be able to face anyone either." Qiyun said: "You don't have to worry about me. Even if I die, I won't burden you." Saying that, she cried loudly. Xiaohe, seeing that his persuasion was not working, stomped his feet and said: "Too willful! Too willful!" Saying that, he walked away angrily. Qiyun cried for a while in the room. Little Wang Ma tried to persuade her several times, but she just ignored her. Little Wang Ma was so anxious that she called Zhuzhai, but Zhuzhai was not in the dormitory. No one came to comfort her. Qiyun cried for a long time, and the more she thought about it, the angrier she became. She felt that she had suffered a great loss today and that she was too wronged. It was no wonder that Zhuzhai didn't understand her. Even her brother came to blame her. Now that the newspaper has published it, the whole city is talking about it, and everyone knows about it. How can she face her colleagues? Chief Miao is also forcing her to leave. If she doesn't leave Beiping, who knows what kind of trouble he will cause. This time, she has completely sacrificed herself for the sake of Zhuzhai. There is nothing to say. Since things have come to this, death is the cleanest solution. Immediately, she took off the ring on her left hand and stuffed it into her mouth. Just at this moment, Little Wang Ma brought in the hot water and saw that Qiyun seemed to have something stuffed in her mouth. She rushed over and shouted: "Boss, what did you swallow?" Qiyun shook her head and frowned, walking towards the bed to lie down. Little Wang Ma followed closely and saw that the ring was gone from Qiyun's finger. She shouted: "Boss! What did you swallow? Where's the ring on your hand?" Qiyun said: "It's none of your business!" Little Wang Ma saw that her expression was not right and panicked. She quickly called Qiyun's brother, Xiaohe, and said: "Master, come quickly! The boss swallowed the ring!" Xiaohe was also flustered and rushed over. He saw Qiyun lying on the bed, frowning tightly. He asked her what was wrong, but she just kept her mouth shut. Xiaohe said: "Sister, why are you doing such a foolish thing? This kind of action is too unwise!" Qiyun just frowned and ignored Xiaohe no matter how he asked her. Xiaohe saw that she didn't answer and frowned, knowing that something was wrong. He quickly called Dr. Zhu Zuwen. Dr. Zhu was originally a theater fan and usually hung out with Xiaohe. In his spare time, he often sang and played instruments at Xiaohe's house to pass the time. This evening, he received Xiaohe's call and heard that the situation was urgent. He rushed over and, after examining her, felt that it was necessary to give her an enema in the hospital. Qiyun initially insisted on refusing, but unable to withstand everyone's persuasion, she was involuntarily sent to the West Something Hospital for treatment. (The End)</p>
