<h3 id="c21">中暹邦交的展望 <a href="#c21" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e21" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">21</a></h3>
<p>暹羅新政府自本月六日起巳經我國政府正式承認，同時英美法等國亦與暹羅恢復外交關係。這是一件値得注意之事。</p>
<p>暹羅自去年十一月九日發生政變後，乃寬亞拜橫所組織的臨時政府一直沒有獲得中，英，美各國的承認，甚至聯合國遠東經濟會議亦曾拒絕暹羅代表出席。惟「不承認」是政治手段，並非外交永久狀態，祗要被「不承認」國家，修明內政，敦睦善鄰，環境就可以改善。所以暹羅政府爲避免孤立，爭取列國的承認，乃按新憲法之規定，於本月一日廿九日舉行普選，成立新議會。民主黨領袖乃寬亞拜橫獲得民選的勝利，旋於二月廿日奉命組織內閣，並已於本月五日獲得下院信任。乃寬組閣後第一件事，卽照會列國，申明暹羅政府當充分履行其一切國際義務，尤盼中暹邦交早日恢復。我國政府鑒於民選後之暹羅政府，已爲其人民一致擁護之合法政府，故決定自三月六日起承認暹羅新政府，恢復中暹之正常外交關係。我駐暹大使李鐵錚卽將返任，暹羅新任駐華大使亦將來華履新。據曼谷消息，暹總理乃寬，對我國迅速承認其領導之政府，表示異常欣慰：英，美，法，荷等國，亦同時採取行動，與暹羅恢復外交關係。從此暹羅政局與中暹之交，撥開雲霧而逐漸開朗了。</p>
<p>暹羅爲東南亞小國之一，惟其地勢重要，農產豐富，與中國關係有唇齒之依。暹羅全部人口有一千五百萬，華僑有三百五十萬，佔五分之一强。以暹京曼谷言，華人約佔百分之八十，足徽中遝關係之密切。華人移殖遝羅，對於暹羅繁榮之貢獻殊大·暹書所載翔實，昔日暹羅荒凉一片，自華儒乘風破浪而來，動儉耐勞，開拓土地，興建土木，發展貿易，與暹人合作建成了今日的樂園，因經濟繁榮而提高了暹人的生活水準。不幸半世紀以來，少數遜人忘記了歷史，反對華僑百方刁難，造成許多不幸事件。但是，暹羅偏狹的種族主義者，儘管以唯國主義排斥華僑，極盡殘殺，放逐，沒收財產的能事，而受害的華僑，始終能忍耐，能寬恕，一本厚往而薄來的精神，曾感動了多少開明的進步的暹人，友善相好，和睦相處。儘管暹羅極權政治有幾次的抬頭，法西斯主義者如鑾披汶的執政，狂言「大泰主義」，威脅華僑，制定法律，運用暴力，摧殘華僑敎育和言論機關，但受禍的華僑，心胸坦白，大公無私，純以移殖的勞力換取生活，從無政治經濟和領土野心，終究能爲開明進步的暹人所諒解而認識。現任暹政府總理乃寬氏，對中暹之交及華僑立塲，素有認識，共態度之中和，深得華僑的信任。這次中暹復交，和未來中暹關係之發展，乃寬實爲理想中的橋樑。</p>
<p>乃寬亞拜橫氏，是溫和的姿協主義，曾三度組閣。乃寬領導之民主黨，以中產階級為中心，過去曾爲鑒披汶的政敵，後又與鑒妥協。去年十一月政變，由於暹羅右派對現狀的不滿，和遏止共產主義之抬頭，所以不惜施用「苦迭打」。鑾披汶爲了和緩國際輿論，爲了抑壓激昂的民情，遂支持乃寬亞拜橫出組臨時政府，折衝國內外的反對力量。四個月以來，乃寬對內的鎭壓，路有貢獻，對列國的和緩，則毫無收穫，乃兩度請求辭職。迨一月廿九日普選，民主黨獲得勝利，乃寬又四度組閣，以修明內政，實施民主，敦睦邦交爲號召，方取得了列國的諒解。列國對於暹羅向持愛護態度。第一，希望暹羅政治的進步，有對外的和平；第二，希望暹羅開明的民主的政治家抬頭，以世界主義揚棄偏狹的種族主義；第三，希望暹羅對遠束經濟之復興有所貢獻。現在乃寬組閣，旣然標榜對內民主，對外睦鄰，列國已予承認，吾人對於暹羅新政府，實寄以無限的希望。我們爲東南亞和平前途着想，願見一個對內民主對外開明的暹羅新政府，並願與之友善相處，爲東南亞的和平及遠東經濟復興而努力。</p>
<p>中暹邦交，不僅關係暹羅經濟發展的前途，抑且爲三百五十萬華僑生存所繁·現在中暹宣佈復　，希望迅從外交途徑，以和平友善態度，解決華僑移暹·華僑經營米業，暹米濟華·及中暹貿易等項問題，並希望暹羅新政府，改絃易轍，以維護華僑權益爲重，廢除管制華僑法令，予華僑以歡治平等和經濟平等。曼谷華人創辦的「曼各雜誌」，認爲乃寬組閣，可爲暹羅打開外交僵局的鑰匙。華人緬懷往日痛苦的經騐，提出了以下主張，要求暹羅新政府表諸事實。（三）當年變披汶訂立的「佛曆二四七九年民立學校條例」·「佛曆二四八二年第二次增修民立學校條例」·「佛曆二四七八年初級敎育條例」等，共中有違背中暹友好條的精神的部份，應予明令廢止，以解除華僑敎育被壓迫的不公平的現狀；（二）當年鑾披汶所頒佈用以驅逐華僑出境的緊急治安法令，及排除華僑從業的保留職業條例，應明令廢止；（三）上屆政府頒佈的「移民限制條例」，不合親善精神，亦應廢止；（四）保證今後不再借屍還魂，訂立束縛華僑的法令。我們同情「曼谷雜誌」的要求，重視三百五十萬華僑的呼聲，願望中暹復交後，一本條約精神和僑民輿情，重新建立良善的中暹關係，共爲東南亞和平繁榮而努力。乃寬亞拜橫氏這次組閣，是現代暹羅新的一頁；中暹邦交亦將有一頁新的開始。這是我們對新暹羅的願望。</p>

<p>〔本報南京八日電〕東北流通劵之改革問題，蔣主席八日已面對東北請願團允准辦理。請願團所提之意見，爲（甲）關內外流通如使用關金券然；（乙）開放關內外匯兌；（丙）確定流通券與法幣之固定比率，同時希望其比率爲一與十之比。主席當稱，全部同意。請願團對此原則上之同意，認爲係請願過程中最大收獲。又該團已向頃由滬返京之行政院副院長王雲五，詢及中央銀行總裁張嘉璈之行止。據王氏答稱：張氏刻正在滬與央行內部詳商東北流通券事，日內決定來京，共商解決辦法。</p>

<p>（丙）東北靑年學籍問題：巳決定准予承認。此項答覆，使東北無數學子得獲法定地位。請願團聞悉，極感欣慰，惟若干技術問題，尙待另組小組會研討。小組會由敎次杭立武邀集各有關司司長，曁東北在京人士馬亮，張選二等組成之。　另關於糧食問題，軍糧部份，巳誌本報前訊，平巳獲得解決，至民食部份，請顧團業已要求援五大都市配售制度前例，請當局將瀋陽列入配售都市之列。其次，關於行總之糧一千噸，已運抵天律，社會部並已派謝植剛。高念曾二員前往辦理轉瀋手續。</p>

<p>（上接一版）另一不太被認識一之因素，爲現在或將來美國在華之極大商業利益，暗中促使議會一趨向於大規模援華之主張。一國務院官員，甚至嚴厲指斥中一國政府之「腐化與無效率」者，亦逐漸關心如何使國民黨軍過去數月在戰塲上之失敗扭轉·</p>
<p>據是輩官員稱，當馬歇爾調解中國內戰失敗而返抵美國時，美國之政策多少爲一旁觀政策，認爲國共雙方如再作戰六個月，必將精疲力盡，而各無所得，届時國共雙方應易於進行聯合政府之談判矣；然六個月之事實證明，並不如前之料想者。今日即抨擊國民黨最嚴厲之官員，亦開始承認美國決不能站於一旁靜觀中國政府之崩潰。然消息最靈通之覜察家相信，如果此種援助能得通過，亦必在援歐計劃之平安獲得通過，不致因增加對華援助而消滅馬歇爾計劃之後。　在馬歇爾承認黨共之控制長江以北之中國，將威脅美國在朝鮮之地位，且使美國日本佔領軍遭遇一「極嚴重之問題」之後，美各報社評即不斷發問：旣如此，政府爲何不以軍事援助中國政府？</p>
<p>歇爾以爲經濟援助可節省中國若干外匯，用以購買少數軍事配備之解釋，似不能吿慰恐懼中國政府失敗者之心。</p>
<p>對遠東經濟利益切身攸關之各公司代表，如美孚油公司代表等，對歷次議會討論援華問題均非當關切。彼等不隱諱期望美國增加對蔣主席之援助，俾使中國獲得和平與穩定之希望，蓋此爲彼等能在中國完全恢復其久已停頓之商業活動或擴大活動之先決條件也。</p>
<p>消息最靈通之觀察家相信，如非馬歇爾個人之威望崇高，政府決不能如此長久不顧增加軍事援華之各種要求也。即使如此，如勃里奇·塔孚脫以及其他贊成軍事援華之議員，一致以全力要求時，政府亦米能不使議會之通過軍事援華案也。</p>
<p>在熱烈討論軍事援華聲中，各方面對美國是否將協助穩定中國幣制問題似少注意。周以德以及華盛頓郵報社許等，認爲中國恢復硬幣銀元制或可有效之言，至今未引起議會或輿論界之特別注意。</p>
<p>美國官方對中國希望美國以一次借款協助上海外匯平準局，不使法幣對外匯率波動過甚之意見，亦甚爲冷淡，大半官員似乎相信此僅爲另一種援華一之信用借款，對外匯局勢或幣制問題，均不會有所裨益。</p>

<p>戴高樂今日之演辭有云，法國正感受國外某一以統治世界爲目的之帝國的威脅，在國內復遭甘爲此等外國執役者之搗亂。吾國荀不採取斷然方法，不能整理我國事。歐洲自由國家必須建立一經濟外交及軍事集團，團結其生產貿易外交及防務，此一具有二億五千萬人民之集團，始能保持生存，法國應為此一起自北海南迄地中海東迄萊茵河集團的中心。而此一集團應包括德奧兩國在內。吾人並認歐洲與美洲必須聯合其力量，以使整個世界得以再生，此即表示美國須以大宗經濟援助歐洲，美國今已採取此項主動，不失爲慷慨而遠見之舉。美國除經濟援助外，淌須準確而明顯地在防務方面支持歐洲。蘇聯正圖統治世界，蘇聯具有龐大的人力及資源，唯命是從的人民，其一億八千萬人民正處絕對獨裁制度之下。蘇聯正在使用其勝牌，其鄰邦芬奧希土及伊朗等國已感惴惴不安，義大利在驚怖狀態之中，法國之各城鎭亦已感覺顯著的不安。在內政方面戴高樂認爲國會制度，巳表現其脆弱性。並曰，就渠而言已完成一切準備，俾於環境允許其負起必要的責任時，即行領導國家趨向自救與偉大之路。渠之內政政策主張减少國庫支出，努力增產，並主張工會應刷凈政治色彩。戴氏已開始與國會中除共黨以外之各黨領袖從事接洽，俾準備國會之解散新選舉之舉行。</p>

<p>〔聯合社華盛頓八日電〕美國務部改組計劃，今日正在研究中。據熟悉其內容者稱，改組之主要目的，在加緊各大部份之工作，但其是否實行，當由國務部長馬歇爾與杜魯門總統決定。聞日常外交事務將由國務部次長主持。美國對歐洲，拉丁美洲，遠東與中東及非洲之關係，即由其分別負責。此外並將添設國務部次長三四人，主特國內外公共關係，經濟及聯合國事務，或並及德日佔領區行政。此項職務支配，將與現行制度根本不同。例如美國與其他各國間之政治關係，現由國務部次長阿穆爾主持，經濟關係由陶伯主持，公共關係由亞倫主持。馬歇爾之下，所遺經濟次長一缺，今後不再遞補。而另設行政次長一席。</p>

<p>〔聯合社柏林七日電〕今日據此間最可靠消息稱，蘇聯正在白海重建前德國威廉哈文之海軍造船所，作爲發展北冰洋航路之重要基地．其選擇之地點爲莫洛托夫斯克。威廉哈文造船所原爲德國在北海之主要基地，實際上將整個作爲對蘇賠償品，其機器·電氣設備·魚雷·金屬板·鎔鑛爐及其他工塲設備，正在拆卸中。此間觀察者對於蘇聯發展其極北海道，並努力開闢波羅的海至黑海間之水路，同時在波羅的海建立其海軍地位，甚饒興趣。但澤灣中之畢洛，巳成爲蘇聯波羅的海南部艦隊之主要基地，蘇艦船可在此裝載燃料食物，並有柯尼斯堡要港之修理及建築設備爲其後盾。</p>

<p>〔路透社倫敦九日電〕英政府今日發表檢討全國經濟現狀之報吿，並發表一九四八年度之經濟計劃，其中對馬歇爾方案下之援助，殊爲重視，認爲英國必須利用此等援助，以加强英國之工作能力及效能，發展國內及英鎊區之供應資源。報吿書謂，英國具有雙重對外復興的計劃，一爲完成國際收付平衡，一爲儘速覓取支付西半球貨價的滿意方法。執行此一計劃之措施，包括（一）提高出口率，尤其是對西半球的出口率；（二）發展英共和邦尤其是英殖民地之供應資源；（二）請英鎊區諸國撙節美元之使用；（四）最後恢復多邊貿易及貨幣之承兌。</p>

<p>〔中央社華盛頓八日合眾電〕保加利亞前農民黨領袖狄米特　夫稱，蘇聯現企圖控制全歐，以準備最後與美國作戰。渠稱，此項預言之一部份根據，係自東歐蘇附庸國家秘密方面傳來之報吿。此等報吿表明蘇聯之次一目標，爲義大利而非芬蘭，共黨將不急於在芬蘭有所作爲，因彼等方準備以義大利爲目標，作分化性之努力。而更爲危險者，乃義大利所發生之各項事件，將與法德奧地利之類似行動有關，此即全歐之謂也。</p>
<p>〔路透社羅馬七日電〕最近捷克之政治發展，頗引起義人之敏感，然政治觀察家尙不能對義大利是否將緊接步捷克後塵之問題，作肯定之答覆。義普選已定四月十八日舉行，共產黨之宣傳頗能擊中人民的心理。義人目前最關切者爲殖民地問題，共黨乃以蘇聯重申應由義託管其前屬領爲資料，以博得民衆之同情。義共同時亦並猛烈抨擊美國。最近義國罷工運動顯著减少，或亦爲義共博取民衆好惑之一種手段。</p>

<p>〔合衆社華盛頓七日電〕美共和黨總統競選，將以本週之新漢姆夏洲之預選會中，有重大之開展。繼此而起者，並將有二次熱烈之舉行，一次爲四月六日之威期康辛洲預選會，另一次爲四月十三日之納布拉斯加州預算會。此數預算會合併之結果，至某種一程度，將於本年共和黨提名爲總統候選人之是否孚衆望，獲得試一驗性之決定。新漢姆夏州之初選會，主要爲紐約州長杜威，及明尼蘇達州司徒森間之競爭。政治觀察家預測杜威將稍佔優勢，杜威及司徒森亦將在　斯康辛州之預選會中，爲爭取二十七名全國大會代表，與麥克阿瑟對壘。</p>

<p>〔法國新聞社紐約八日電〕華萊士八日在此間選舉人集會上發表演說稱，指吾等爲赤色共黨及蘇聯特務之人，並不真正畏懼共產主義，而渠等實畏懼民主政治，渠等在工資减縮時，在存款喪失時，在不安增高時，渠等恐懼人民之憤怒，此即為渠等公開討論戰爭之罪惡政策之結果，而足以浪費吾國財產。</p>

<p>〔中央社東京八日電〕蘆田均內閣組閣各主要問題，截至本日午後業已解決，然閣員名單尙未公佈·一般人士認爲此新聞或將短命夭折。政治觀察家認爲未來內閣之政策與片山之內閣無何區別。蘆田內閣閣員中社民黨份子將較其民主黨者爲多，蘆田允許社民黨，計十九閣員職務中，首先予以選擇，民主黨人僅于農林省有所爭持。</p>
<p>〔新亞社東京八日電〕幣原喜重郞七日於桐生市就目前政局發表談話稱：「不拘片山入閣與否，蘆田內閣係一短命內閣，因社會黨左派將採與片山內閣時同樣之態度所致也。在左派不合作之情形下，蘆田內閣議席無法占國會之過半數，故新內閣之壽命，恐不過三個月」。</p>
<p>〔合眾社東京八日電〕日本觀察家八日談稱：蘆田首相仍面臨組閣之困難，蓋三個支持蘆田之政黨業已開始操縱「選擇」內閣閣員席，現日本內閣似不能於十日前完成。仝時前首相片山在演說中稱：即使蘆田如能組成內閣，但其壽命亦不致超過三個月，其前任首相吉田現正在領導保守份子所組織之新黨運動。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕吳市長於昨午召集民食調配會主委任顯羣，糧食部管制司長劉行驥，參事葉實夫，及行政院處理美國救濟物資委員會，中華救濟團等代表，共同檢討配米進行狀况。會後並在市府大禮堂舉行記者招待會，首由吳市長報吿，略稱：全面配米實施後，本市米價仍吿上漲，除已電糧食部抑平產地價格外，並努力促進配米制度之效率·歡迎各界對配米工作批評及撿舉舞弊。配米開始後，迄昨一止已發出食米十萬担，足供一百萬人購用，尙餘食米四十萬祖，可在本月二十日前陸續送出。又本月份上半月份配米蹬，原定至十二日截止領購，現決准延至二十七日爲止。</p>
<p>外僑配證警局辦理</p>
<p>繼由任主委報吿：（一）自四月份起，配米證改爲每月一期，不分上下半月。因照目前估訂，購米可不致擁擠。本月上半月米證，至本月五日止，已發出二百四十七萬五千張，下半月米證，當於十日前發出。（二）外僑配米證，因戶口登記向由警察局辦理，故配米證亦由警局發出，可於十一日至十五日期間辦理完竣。（三）凡市民在本月十日之前甲報戶口者，皆可領得配米證，否則可具狀吿發。（四）本市市民五百萬人，以每人每月一斗計，需配米五十萬担。全市米店計一千九百五十餘家，而執行配米者計八百九十二家，爲加速配米工作，業已要求中信局各倉庫，於週末晚間仍照常工作，務使每天開啓八個倉庫，出米三萬二千担。（五）配米六日以來，米款計收到百分之六十，此因代收款項之中岡銀行及郵匯局人手不够所致，經兩處加强工作後，昨已收達百分之八十，今日可望收足。（六）米質方面，本月份配米係政府自籌，其中二十五萬担爲一號暹米，十五萬祖爲緬甸米，十萬担爲糧食部在長江流域收購者，米色恐較差，惟皆與中熟米相似，望市民勿誤會。四月份起，則全係美米，民食調配委會並將成立統一新聞機構，按月公佈各區配米質地。</p>
<p>米價前途任主委表示樂觀</p>
<p>任主委對本市米價前途頗爲樂觀，渠表示配米已佔全市米市塲需要總額之三分之二，對米價具有控制力量。最近自由米價雖吿上漲，憔屬偶然，深信日後必吿回跌</p>

<p>〔本報太原二日航訊〕西北實業建設公司是十四年來作為山西政治，經濟，國防建設上的一個物質上的最大支柱·在過去，以豐饒的地下資源，奠定了山西輕重工業的基礎，在今天它就搖身一變而為戡亂的供應部。構築凋堡工事的水泥鋼筋，交通方面的道軌，列車，民生需用的布匹燃料，電力，如果這此物資裏短少了一，二件，晋中十七縣一市就決不會支持到眼前的磐石般的安定狀態。</p>
<p>卅六個廠</p>
<p>西北公司在組織上說，是善西全省民營事業裏的機構之一，但實際上目前各工廠原料的採購與生產成品的外銷，多因善對外交通的窒息而由政府統盤的加以控個，這　官民間的賬目，暫時還談不到淸算。</p>
<p>包括毛織，皮革，洋灰，電化，機車，煉鋼，製紙，發電等經重工業五十二個單位工廠，經過八年抗戰，只瞭下了卅六個單位，誰知一面在收拾殘破，銳意復興，一面竟又要抗拒匪共的肆擾，在「工廠即陣營」的口號下，踏進每一個工廠，多看到烟囱在電縱和碉堡後面冒着黑烟，三年來許多礦廠的失陷，也不斷有悲壯沉痛的戰鬥經歷。</p>
<p>活動堡壘</p>
<p>記者團參觀了這裏的機車廠，煉鋼廠，紙廠，紡織廠，機車廠除掉正常的修理機車，客貨軍外，費了六個月工夫，已經造成了一輛「復興號」機車和「醒獅號」活動堡壘，這種堡壘壁用一五〇糎厚的水泥做成，裏面有步槍口機槍口砲口一節可以容納廿個士兵，即使軌道被破壞，但裏面藏有足數十五天的食糧，可以使他們孤立作戰而無所畏懼。其他軍用武器，有進步改良了的飛彈，曾在前年大同保衛戰中成為最後擊敗匪共的武器，三六式七，五生的的小山砲，射程可（遠達八千公尺。為了要使這些工作圓滿進展，廠裏也掀起了「鬥爭」浪潮，肅淸偽裝。</p>
<p>在鞍山陷入匪手以後，這裏仿造克魯伯鋼鐵廠建造的西北煉鋼廠，乃成了全國唯一的可以完整地煉焦，煉鐵，煉鋼的塲所。大同，定囊等地的煤鐵礦來不了，經過兩年多的勘測，在太原郊外的東西兩山，又找到了這些地下資源。現在，每天生產生鐵五十噸，鋼六十噸，本年度都計劃增產到二百噸，該廠的主要設備，有五千瓩透平發電機兩部，副產收回蓄熱式二百四十噸煉焦爐一座，、一百二十噸及四十噸熔礦爐各一座，三十噸煉鋼平爐兩座，中型小型輾鋼設備二套。</p>
<p>呼籲支援</p>
<p>其他各廠的增產計劃也經擬定，由這些數字裏不難看出目下晋中工業的眞面日：機器廠二年來已產出各種機器七百多部，本年計劃增至一千部，紡織廠月產十四磅白布二萬匹，擬增至四萬匹，發電廠現在最高負荷為一萬瓩擬增至三萬瓩，煤礦第一廠擬從月產三萬噸增至六萬噸。現在二萬多員工幾乎每天都做到十小時以上的工作，工資是完全一律的，以實物來計算平均每天每人可得小麥四升，以一半發給實物，一半折算法幣。</p>
<p>橫在西北公司面前的大難題，莫過於交通的斷絕了，去年一年該公司親空遝只輸入了原料一千五百噸，輸州產品一千八百噸。他們呼籲：政治，軍事，經濟，三者是互為因果的，今日以軍力增援　陽，以經濟支助太原，就是穩定東北與華北，而東北與華北之穩定，也就是鞏固政府的基石。（本報記者楊文育）</p>

<p>〔本報嘉興七日訊〕經過了幾朝春風春雨的吹酒，桑枝上抽出了緣芽，桃花也含苞待放，到處充溢着春的氣象，給每個沉默的臉龐上添了個笑靨。</p>
<p>「南湖去　」的呌聲，已在船孃們的口腔中發出。是的，嘉興能够供給人們遊春的是南湖。但是，她太貴族化了，雇一艘姑娘遊船，非百萬以上莫辦。單就擺渡到烟雨樓頭，至少需十萬廿萬元。今春的遊客，已不如往年那麼多，倒是鐵路的苗圃，却更顯得為遊人所注意。</p>
<p>征兵征糧</p>
<p>入春後，嘉興的征兵與征糧，正是在緊張關頭，省方的高級人員，在這一段時間內，差不多來嘉興有十次之多，同時縣級人員，也大半巡廻在鄉鎭督導協助催征，至於鄉鎭保田機構，當然更不用說了。</p>
<p>今年嘉興辦理征兵工作，有一點是値得種頌的，就是到現在為止，沒有發生過舞弊的案子，與往年比較，確已進步得多了。但願至結束為止，能够始終保持這個淸白。至於志願兵的安家費，數字却很可觀，每名為糙米十五石，鄉鎭公所向壯丁征收的安家費，也是以米計算了，每名糙米五斗。</p>
<p>關於田賦方面，到目前為止，已經征起了廿四萬一千餘石。嘉興的總配額為卅九萬石，所以已超出六成以上。現在還是加緊的催繳中，據辦田糧處人員談，至本月底止，可能達到八成。</p>
<p>舊欠糧戶，及滯納的大佃戶，潘縣長用私人名義遠請佃主談話，以勸導的方式催繳，這樣的做法，在田賦的征收工作上，得到了很大的收穫。</p>
<p>文化危機</p>
<p>嘉典的文化事業，在一般縣份比較，可以說還算發達。一個四十二萬人品的縣城里，能夠看到三張對開報紙（嘉興商報，嘉區民國日報，國民日報），已經是不容易的事了·可是，廢曆年關倒平穩的渡過了，春季物價的攻勢卻感到難以應付，白報紙每令達三百萬大關，員工的薪給，隨生活指數遞增，為了彌補　額的赤字支出，連續提高報價，並調整廣告刋例，因此，銷數　着縮豆，結果收入仍無法增加，開原的計劃終於失敗，為了支撑今後的日子，報業公會連日召開緊急會議，但是終沒有一個相當的辦法來解決這問題的嚴重性。記者以目前　　勢推測，解決這問題　最後方法，可能三報合併，現在所以勉强的支撑者，還希望着配給白報紙能在短期內價購到手，以圖挽救。否則，其生存的延續恐怕很成問題了。</p>
<p>賭風未戢</p>
<p>杭嘉湖向有魚米之鄉之稱，因過去的豐衣足食，而養成了今日嘉興人民奢靡腐化的生活，又經過多年敵偽的麻醉敎育，一向樸素的習俗都走了樣，春節裏，嘉興的賭風之盛，可以說創歷年來的新紀錄，賭場之多，遍及全縣每一角落，且竟有用廿兩黃金下賭注的奇聞。雖然地方當局為了戢止賭風，實施鄉鎭自治公約，規定賭博者拘獲者須罰廿萬以上百萬以下的現金，充作鄉鎮自治事業費，但是，其效果亦微乎其微。</p>
<p>為了捉賭，警局方面鬧出了許多不幸的事件，如城區東門太華旅社內，賭徒包下了一〇五·一〇六兩問房間，日夜聚衆狂賭，已有數月之久，常警察局派警長宋天培率警八名往提時，反被賭徒持人衆勢大抗拒，反受了槍傷，宋驚長的右腰際中了彈，從左腹部穿出，等到警局大批員警前往，却早已人去樓空。受傷者雖朱斃命，而至今尙未出院·同　的事情，在鍾埭鎭也有發生，警察提賭，反被綑縛毆辱，逼寫　過書　放。此外，更有參議員因勸導停止賭博而被毆等事發生，誠堪令人驚嘆！</p>
<p>守舊迷信</p>
<p>除了賭博以外，春節裏一般人就忙着演戲酬神，拜佛行香的事情。農民們始終脫不了「守舊」和「迭信」的觀念，總把田裏所收穫的歸功於「菩薩」，所以他們的心裏，對於演戲酬神和拜佛行香，消耗一筆鉅額的錢，眞是「滿不在乎」！這種籌款的方法，大都以田畝的多寡來計算，譬如說一畝田籌款一萬，或米一升，那眞是輕而易舉。假使對於公共事業，要籌募一點經費的話，那就不可同日而語了，尤其是鄉鎭敎育經費之類，比討飯還要困難，因為他們根本瞧不起讀書人，同時也不願意自己的孩子去唸書，這原因是今日的讀書人，已不如揑鋤頭的人了，他們帮工一天，可以吃四頓飽飯，和魚肉下酒，還　到手五升白米的工資，試問那一個公務人員的待遇及得上他們？這又是目前農村中的一件可悲的現實。（本報記者陳劍雄）</p>

<p>塔勢如湧出，孤高聳天宮，登臨出世界，磴道盤虛空，突兀壓神州，崢嶸如鬼工，四角礙白日，七層磨蒼穹，下窺指高鳥，俯聽聞驚風，連山君波濤，奔凑似朝東。靑槐夾馳道，宮館何玲瓏，秋色從西來，蒼然滿關中，五陵北原上，萬古靑濛濛，净理了可悟，勝因夙所宗，誓將掛冠去，道覺資無窮。（岑參詩）</p>
<p>〔本報西安一日航訊〕到過西安的人，大都沒有不知道大小雁塔的。主要的原因是那裏是佛敎名剎，而且是有着一座高達三百尺的雁塔。每年舊曆正月十五過了，十六這一天就是雁塔盛會，西安市民成群結隊的到慈恩寺去，在南門外面也是車馬凑集，大聲吆喝着：誰去！逛大雁塔去。從唐代起，一直到現在，年年如此，除了戰亂的烽烟，燒到長安，否則這個古會，總是熱鬧的。</p>
<p>大慈恩寺</p>
<p>在西安南郊七華里處，大雁塔在該寺內。據志籍所記載為貞觀廿二年害高宗為文德皇后而立為寺。現在佔地約為三十畝，其規模已遠非過去「重樓複殿，雲閣洞房，」的盛况了，只是古老的建築多間，再配上殘垣頹壁，蒙上一層風沙塵土，滿目凄凉，假如不是奇後巍然的七級寳塔尙在，恐怕早就沒人逛來了。</p>
<p>雁塔在寺後院，西安人呌大雁塔，以與大福薦寺內之小雁塔相別，共有七級，表磚內土，當年裏面據說每層都有千餘粒舍利子·塔心內虛，有梯可登，旋轉而上，至最高一層，如果天晴氣朗，北望西安，歷歷如繪，四周河山，一目了然。塔的下面有一塊石碑，係唐褚遂良所書，現在因歷代塌摹，字跡稍顯模糊，碑上彫刻細緻，遠非一般可比，據說在字帖中，這也是一塊名碑</p>
<p>到現在雖然字跡不顯，而碑上黑色斑斑，看來一直還有人在拓印。</p>
<p>塔下南隔二座天殿，石碑纍纍，這就是著名的「雁塔題名」，自唐以來，士子於中進士後，相率來雁塔，題名碑上，冀欲流傳百仳，後來各代，國都他徒，雁塔題名，再也不見進士們來光顧了，只有陜西鄉試，舉人庠生們，把自己的名字鐫上，現在題名碑，已遠非原來者，僅留明淸二代之鄉試碑。</p>
<p>出雁塔再南行二里，就是曲江池，在隋唐兩代，這裏是春遊勝地</p>
<p>仕女如雲，風光豪華，彼輩多係名卿，且有以脂粉作紅饀，掛於竿上，引馬前進。所謂「六飛南幸芙蓉苑，十里飄香入巫城」。現在只留下一些村落，除去雁塔會期中有許多遊客之外，平常一如北方常見的村落。抗戰期中中央軍校有一部份學生在這裏訓練，把村裏的墻壁都粉刷一新。但是如今又「復原」了。</p>
<p>五家坡在曲江東南，一條土溝裏，這條溝就是京戲中所謂鴻溝岸也。「寒窑」在溝南岸，據人說那就是王寳釧守節等待平郎十八年的地方，現在洞外已是屋宇整齊，連王三姐坐的洞子，現在也舖上古磗靑石，烟火之盛為他地少有，而且洞小人多，熱烘烘地，沒有一點「寒氣」。在洪溝兩岸很少有　榮，兩稍遠一些，就又遍地皆是，也許這是土質關係，可是當地的人却說那是王三姐在十八年的凍餒之中，把那種齊菜採食盡了。五家坡又呌五典坡，在西安的志籍當中，未見記載，和他的主角一樣，同是不見經傳，因「紅鬃烈馬」一劇而馳名於廿。</p>
<p>有一個曲江池的村人，吿訴記者，去年他們村莊，曾發生了一件不光榮的事，有一家出征軍人的妻子，丈夫出門三年，她就不甘獨宿與人通姦，被其姑翁察覺，訴於長安法院，依法判了罪，這在戰亂年頭，本來是常見的悲劇，可是發生二在王三姐「寒窑」附近，就耐人尋味了。</p>
<p>所有的廟宇中，幾科都有人在求神問卜，許多老太太跑在佛像面前，一臉誠虔，抱着簽筒搖搖，對泥像訴說着她的兒子出征了，幾年沒有信息，求神示知。有一位在起立之後還嘆息着：「啥時候才太平？」言下老淚縱橫。世亂年荒，使沒有受過敎育的人更對人沒有信心，他們都把希望寄托在神的脚下了。（本報記者張僊洲）</p>

<p>〔英國新聞處倫敦八日電〕以促進中英文化關係為主旨之英國各大學中國委員會，充任中英敎育文化基金董事會在英國之代理機關，以安頓並照料董事會遺送來英學生，已歷時十五年。此項留學生前後已達九屆，總數約二百人，皆獲在英取得更高學位，殆無例外。在各種研究工作中嶄然露頭角者，亦頗不乏人。彼等學成歸國，均担任各項重要工作，而以大學敎職為最多。</p>

<p>〔本報重慶五日航訊〕民國二十一年七月，四川善後督辦公署，特請甘績鏞於巴縣龍隱　購地一千四百畝，籌辦了一所鄉村師範專修科，就是今日四川省立敎育學院的前身。次年七月合併了四川中心農事試驗塲，擴充為四川鄉村建設學院，分設「社會」「農業」兩系，才稍其規模，並對川省鄉治建設，農業改進，頗多貢獻。</p>
<p>甘績鏞出任川省財政廳長後，二十四年八月辭卸院長職，即由高顯鑑繼任。敎育部以該院組織與現行學制不合。二十五年六月可議改組為四川省立敎育學院，學系改稱，（一）社會敎育系，（二）農事敎育系，遂與四川第三區行政專員公署合力於轄區九縣試辦實驗區，以教育的力量，協助　進政治設施，成績卓著。</p>
<p>抗戰軍興，高顯鑑病辭，　歆充任，先後添設了敎育及國文兩專修科，計增「國文」「數學」「英文」「農藝」「農化」五系。俟由巴黎大學敎育博士柴有恒長院，復設「史地」「博物」「園藝」三系，迄至現在，該院已有十一學系，二十餘級，六百餘生（內二百餘女生）。校舍寬闊，實早具備大學文，理，農，敎等院基礎。</p>
<p>勝利以還，為紀念此民族復興聖地，國民參政會乃建議改院為大，四川省議會亦數度決定。因此，才有一月十九日起的罷踝行動，為川敎院成立以來的第三次擴校運動。</p>
<p>四川省政府於二月廿七日省務會議中，曾經複議：成立改大籌備委員會，鄧錫侯主席担任主委，副王委為鄧漢祥秘書長，任覺五敎育廳長；其餘委員為向傳義，吳景伯，柴有恒等十二人。第一次委員會，本月一日在蓉舉行，對改大方案，研討頗詳。惟據本報記者多方訪問結果：該院上學期補考及本學期開學日期，截至發稿時止，尙未決定，因為擴校委員會的最低要求為：（甲）堅持「陪都大學」名稱，本學期內必須籌備究成，下學期則用大學名義招生。（乙）立即撥發二月廿七日省務會議通過的建校經費黃榖六萬石及國幣三十億。柴有恒院長及學生代表彭治富，彭啓予，李文揚等四人，當俟上列擴委會建議二項獲有確實答復後，方能由蓉返渝。（本報特派員　陽　）</p>

<p>主辦當局對乙丙兩組之決賽，規定採用淘汰制，乙組比賽如過和局，則延長卅分鐘（上下半時各十五分鐘），丙組延長廿分鐘，（上下半時各十分鐘）如再無勝負，擇期重賽。</p>
<p>星期六下午之甲組賽，靑白靑相逢機隊，按靑白靑係上屆市長盃錦標隊，本屆足球聯賽中，出師以來，每仗俱捷，對聯甲冠軍，抱有必得決心，全隊自出席埠際大賽，由港返滬以來，埋首苦練，確為甲組各隊之勁敵，康隊雖本屆崛起之新軍，惜乎經驗不足，致每戰皆北，週六遇强敵，自然必敗無疑。</p>
<p>另場東華對猶太之戰，東華為鞏固該隊在足球季之實力，在港招兵買馬，大事擴充，除謝錦洪業巳於日前在滬漏臉外，郭英祺不日即將報一到，另有大將數員，亦將次第由港來滬，觀其積極整頓，對冠軍螺聯之野心，可以想知。猶太並非弱者，在球壇素有黑馬之稱，本屆雖人材不齊，但實力依然高深莫測，屆時東華遇之，自須謹愼從事。本週秩序錄下：</p>

<p>昨日食米市况，奔騰更速。相傳無錫有中糧公司收購，價格不斷上升，滬市遂　其影響。然昨日到貨較前增加，南北二市共到一萬一千一百九十五石，貨主竟少脫售，致行家樣合上，陳樣寥寥，價格在貨主力抬下，早市猛升最厲。北市塲特高粳一度喊三百九十萬，錫白粳曾喊三百八十萬。收市回降，特高粳三百八十八萬，錫白粳三百七十萬元，薄稻三百七十萬元，各較上週末收市暴升近四十萬元。白元亦三百七十萬，陰元三百六十五萬，南市場價格低於北市十萬元，白粳薄稻各為三百六十萬元。</p>

<p>黃豆最開，因賣買雙方擯持，至極遲方開盤，漢口乍豆首開一百七十五萬，後因去銷呆滯，回小至一百七十二萬，最後為一百七十萬，尙不易脫手。生仁廣帮略有吸納，價升二十至三十萬。菉豆亦升二十餘萬。芝蔴津帮雖不取，亦跟米價上升。漢口白蔴三百三十萬，九江奶蔴三百〇五萬，各砌高二十餘萬。苞米因靑島受電力問題，不能磨粉，致青帮未取，而到貨四集，雖各糧俱升，獨苞米下跌五萬元。揀靑挺十萬，紅糧升五萬。</p>

<p>工商輔導處鑒於橡膠工業製品，直接關於國防工業，與民生日用至鉅。而國內橡膠業復因橡膠輸入限額不足，不能發揮能力，未能達到自足自給之目的，為發展該業起見，該處昨特擬訂推進該業計劃一份，呈經濟部核辦。茲探誌其內容如下：</p>
<p>國內各埠如上海台灣靑島天津廣州瀋陽等地所有橡膠工廠，每月最高需要橡膠量約在三八〇〇噸。其目前困難情形，（一）橡膠輸入限額不足實需，故各廠不能發揮全力生產。（二）新設立小規模橡膠廠太多，且其目的在收取官價橡膠，轉售黑市牟利，因此大廠原料更成恐慌。（三）國內全年應用汽車胎約廿七萬套，現在祗有大中華正泰齊魯瀋陽等廠製造，每年產量不足十萬套，相差十七萬之多。製造汽車胎機器，又必須應川舶來品，橡膠廠因不易取得外匯，故無法增產，（四）三角皮帶及橡膠帶製造，上海頗為發達，倘舶來品禁止進口，則此項工業將益趨繁榮。推進辦法：（一）增加橡膠輸入限額，（二）限制新廠之設立，新廠之製品如為套鞋跑鞋者，不予外匯之配給。（三）準許製造汽車胎機器進口，並規定每季汽車貽進口量在三年內達到自足自給之目的。（四）本國三角皮帶及橡膠質量，均可供各業之需要，應規定逐漸限制進口之辦法，若能按前項計劃辦理，預定可收到下列數點之效果：（一）規定生橡膠每月之輸入量以定實際之需要。（二）頒佈新設立工廠之外匯配給辦法，（三）設法資助民營工廠，向國外採聯量新式機器後，可設立每月製造二萬套大小汽車胎之工廠。（四）規定三角皮帶等之逐漸限制輸入辦法，並資助民營廠，使三角皮帶之產量足供全國各工廠之用云。</p>

<h3 id="c168">悼懷黑德教授 <a href="#c168" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e168" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">168</a></h3>
<p>— 謝幼偉</p>
<p>當代學術界之一偉人懷黑德敎授（Prof.　Alfrel　North　Whitehead）已於一九四七年十二月二十日在美國麻省之劍橋逝世。亨年八十有六。此一代大師之逝世，我國報章似未見有紀載之省。迄今距懷氏逝世之期已兩月，作者始從美國什誌，獲　此消息。得訊雖週，哀敬之情未减。因先所述知，以誌吾欽們景仰之誠。</p>
<p>壞氏不僅為一偉大之哲學家，亦一偉大之科學家。其在　學上之造就，早無疑問。以西洋哲學史上之地位而論，彼之地位必上足與相拉圖，亞里士多德，康德，黑格爾諸賢相抗衡，近足與柏烈得萊，柏格森，杜威，羅素諸哲相競秀。以思想之博大精深，妙義無窮言，吾人可謂懷氏乃今日之黑格爾。凡曾讀懷氏書者，必與作者有同感焉。。云其　科學家，則彼對數學原理之研究，亦足自成一家。彼與羅素合著之『數字原理』一書，經成為冶數理邏輯者之經典。雖純粹數學家亦無忽視之可能。所著「科學與近代世界』一書，於科學原理之闡明，尤稱獨步。是請懷氏亦一偉大之科學家，懷氏固當之而無愧也。</p>
<p>懷氏英人也，於一八六一年二月十五日生於英倫康特省（Rent），鄧納特島（Lsle　of　Thaent）上之藍斯格特城（Ramsgate）。其先人均從事敎育，宗敎及地方政務等業。祖父多瑪斯（Thomas）嘗為當地一私立學校之校長。其父阿爾械（Alfred）　其　，後又改任牧師職。懷氏生長如是之家庭，故後雖研究數字與哲學，對敎育及宗敎，亦具熱誠。年十九，入劍橋大學。畢業後，即任職該校，達二十餘年之久。所授課程，則數學也。由一九一一年起，改任倫敦大學教授。在英倫時，懷氏雖已有哲學上之著作，學術界尚未以哲人視之。一九二四年美國哈佛大學聘懷氏為哲學敎授。懷氏之以哲學為萊，實始於是時。自茲以後，懷氏哲學上之重要著作，逐漸發表，地位日固，聲譽日隆，哲學界送不能不以一代宗師目之矣。</p>
<p>懷氏著作，主要者有下列各種：（一）『普遍代數A　Treatice　on　Univercal　Algebra，898），（二）『數學原理』（Princjpia　Mathematica，1910與羅素合著）（三）『數　導論』（An　Intro　uction　to　Mathematica，1911）（四）『自然知識原理之論究』（Ａn　Enquiry　ConcerningThe　Pringcples　of　Natural　Knowle　gc；1919），（五）『自然之槪念』（The　Concept　of　Nature，1920），（六）『相對論原理』（The　Principle　of　Relativity，1922），（七）『科學與近代世界』（Science　and　The　Mo　rｎ　World，1925），（八）『演進中之宗敦』（Religion　In　The　Making，1926），（九）『符號主義，共　義及影響』（Symbolism，Its　Meaning　and　Effect，1927），（十）『歷程與實在』（Proceos　and　Reality，1926），（十）（一）『理性之職能』（The　Function　of　Reacon，1929），（十二）『敦育目的論文集』（The　Aims　of　Elucation　and　Other　Essay，1929），（十三）『觀念之冒險』（The　Adventure　of　Ldeas，1933），（十四）『思想之方式』（Modes　of　Thought，1938），（十五）『科學與哲學論文集』（Essays　in　Science　and　Philosophy，1947）。以上各書，除「科學與近代世界」及「思想之方式」中論「生命與自然」之一部有中譯本外（見商務印書館，萬有文庫），作者所知，其餘均無中譯。此非我國哲人忽視懷氏，實因懷氏書，極不易譯。如依文直譯，不加言釋，雖哲學專家，不易理解也。</p>
<p>懷氏思想，自非本文所能叙述。所可得而簡略言之者，哲學上之各種之義，各種派別，如唯心，如　實，均不能無條件而加諸於懷氏。以往有人目懷氏為新唯實　者，唯懷氏思想發展後，新唯實　已不能範圍其思想。懷氏自名其學為「六機體之哲學」或「通體相關之哲學」（Philocophy　of　Organim），意謂宇由一切，實連體相關，如一有機體然。彼認為宇宙或自然之根本或實任，非心亦非物，而為一種『事素』或『實際體』（Event　sor　Actual　Entity）。此『事素』或『實際體』即宇宙之究竟，所以構成宇宙者。人與自然，或心與物，均此『實際體』以不同之組織方式而成。此「實際體」有遷流性，故非固定靜止，而實為一種活動之歷程。此『實際體』復有擴延性，即一『實際體』侵入其他「實際體」，其他「實際體」亦侵入此一『實際體』，故非單獨孤立，而實彼此相關。因而宇宙內之一切，皆在變動之歷程中，皆互相影響，物物交織，一物含有他物為其要素，他物亦含舟有此一物為其要素。華　所謂：『一即一切，一切即一」，懷氏學可謂亦有此種意味彥。</p>
<p>懷氏為八，作者亦僅能略言其一二。懷氏任敎哈佛時，我國哲人多看門其門下者。（如賀麟，沈有鼎，瞿　晨諸位，皆嘗從問學者）民十八至民二十之際，作者亦嘗忝列門牆。雖自愧於吾師之說，領悟甚少，然對吾師為人，則印象極深。懷氏之為人，可謂藹然儒者，和善可親。每星期五晚，懷氏歡迎學生一其家。至則懷氏夫婦含笑相迎。周旋於一二十學生之中，有問必答，毫無倦容。其心慈，其　誠，其態度平易，其話言深刻，雖寥寥數語，足啓人思。斯固學術界之一完人也。</p>
<p>以上略述懷氏之生平，著作，思想，為八竟。吾重懷氏之思想，亦重懷氏之為人。以懷氏之成就言，懷氏為不死矣。</p>

<p>在大都市中，五方雜處，許多人都學得說兩種以上的語言，術語槪稱為雙語操用Bilingualism。這在某些情形下是不可避免的。例如有些祗會說粵語的家庭，如在上海居住，則家中的小孩可能不得不學三種語言：在家中說粵語，在外面操滬白，到學校中學國語。有許多外國人的小孩子，對『阿媽』則說中國話，對父母則說本國話，對西葸則說洋涇浜。這都是無可如何。但有些文化六準較高而洋化厲害一點的家庭，竟用十分勉强的手段，鼓勵着兒童說兩種話——在家說英語，出外說中國話。這一種辦法對於兒童，潛伏着一些危險，我們在這裏稍為提及一些。</p>
<p>兩語操用對於兒童語言的發展，有無壞的影鄉？法人J．Ronjat對此曾有極仔細的觀察。他的兒子Loui與他講法文，但與其母親則講德文。據Ronjat說，他的兒子對於這兩種文字，不論發言或閱讀，都一上也不比祗學一種文字的為落後。但問題是：這一個案子可以為訓麽？不盡然。</p>
<p>美國人D．T．Spoerl會對這一個問題發表過幾篇論文。她以為除非這兩種語言隔得一淸二楚，例如母親說德文便一句法文也不講，父親亦祗講法文而總不講德文，一點淆混也沒有，發達可能是正常的。倘若稍微有一點夾雜，情形便不如此理想，語言的發展至少可以暫時落後些。至於道種影響是否永久的，那就意見不一致了。英國人S．S．Laurie說：『假使一個小孩可以同時學得兩種語言而仍然一樣地好，他就　糟。他的理智與文化的發展不因此而加倍，祗是减半」。</p>
<p>Smith研究夏哇夷各種兒童語言發展的結果是兩歲到六歲的小孩都因為　種語言而發展落後。她說，雙語操用者常用驚嘆詞的短句，複句較少。專指物名的句子時期要長些。一般的研究，似乎證明兩語操用對於兒童語言的發展是有妨碍的。</p>
<p>我們知道發音的器官與手在神經上是有連帶關係的。雙語操用可能影響到動作。例如有一個研究要兒童舉有手，指左耳等動作，雙語操用者便比單語操用者多些淆亂，錯誤與猶豫。Henss有一個兒子生長在荷蘭，直到四歲止，祗說荷蘭文，雙手都善用。四歲進一個德文學校，德文進步很快，可是他開始專用右手了。長大後，他又進德國學校，結果他專用右手了。這時候他荷蘭文與德文說得一樣多。同時他開始口結，直到他離開荷蘭，忘記了荷蘭文，他的口結才停止。雙語操用者口結較多，這是研究者一致公認的事實。</p>
<p>雙語操用最大的危險似乎是情緒的。同時學兩種語言，對於中智以下的人，可能是一個很重的担負。如果敎法不善，彼此間稍有淆混，情緒可能衝突。口結便是一種表示。再者，語言是文化的媒介。它不僅可用以達意，它也是傳統的保存者。每一種語言便代表一種社會。沒有兩種是完全可相比擬的。例如外國小孩對老媽子說中文，對父母說英文。那末，中文便成為一稱卑賤的言語，他說中文時，他的人格會與說英文時兩樣。換言之，肉為這兩種語言代表兩種社會，兩種文化，操用兩種語言，便免不了衝突—兩種不同地位或價値的衝突。一個人，特別是能力不强而仍在發展中的人，便會因這種衝突而引起人格的分化。這是很嚴重的危險。可是在成人，或者是能力强的兒童，這種衝突是可以避免的。一方而他的綜合能力强些，一方而他的心理組成系統分明些。兩語操用的危險在成人雖不如此顯著，但在小孩，便不能用成人的標準計量了。</p>
<h3 id="c170">鮑桑克論心身關係 <a href="#c170" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e170" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">170</a></h3>
<p>— 韓裕文</p>
<p>心是精神的，身是物質的。身體佔空間，而受空間的限制；心不佔空間，而蔑視空間的距離和畛械，凡身體的運動，或腦子底變化都以身體的條件為因綠，是機械的，被動的；所以我們身體的無心的動作嚴格地說，不能算是我們自己底。惟有出於自動的心底行為才能說是我們自己的；因為心底本性是主動的，自由的，開創的，不同於物的。</p>
<p>心與身旣然這樣不同，牠們彼此有什麼關係呢？這是一個萬古常新的問題。心物二元諭者首先肯定心和物為究全不同，各自獨立的兩種實體，接着又說牠們有因果底關係，身心底動作彼此影響。鮑桑克認為這不但破壞了心身底連結，誤解心身底活動各自需要外在的原因，而且旣認為心是非物質的，同時又認為心是物質的了。這固然是個不通之論。</p>
<p>至於心物平行說，把心和物底實在性都取消，而把牠們說為一個精神的本體之兩種不同的屬性，這兩種屬性各有其一套因果底秩序，而互不相犯”却彼此應合。這種說法誠然近理，但仍然有把心物析為二片底嫌疑，何况兩種完全不同的屬性為什麼能有彼此完全應合的秩序和作用？這仍然是一個難以說明的謎。</p>
<p>主觀的唯心論者只承認心底實在性一而否認物質底存在，例如巴克萊以為天下的物沒有不是觀念的。他們這樣保全了心物底同一性。但鮑桑克認為我們底心旣不能無條件地為觀念和能力底原因，也不能創生或製造一個商等的有機體。宇宙問無憶識的自然現象充滿了超乎人心所能計劃和創造之精美的奇蹟。在自然底演化中，是先有了物質底反應性，吸引性等，進而有有機體底生命，然後才發展為我們底心，所以有意識的心是後起的。我們底心底下面有無意識的生命等為其基礎，上面有社曾意識或文化精神等為其上層和理想。我們底心寗可說是有機體要達到牠最完滿的理想底一個手段。有機體底變化，例如細胞底分裂，直接引起生命底變化。每一個心理的系統必有一個物理的系統為其衣現底工具，心必以神經系為其發動機，所以物質是不可少的，並且不容忽視難以否認的。</p>
<p>但物質底只是一種外在性，並不是一種實體。物不能憑空而有，心也不能突然而生。所以唯物論者獨承認非心的物質為最後的實在而把心解釋為物質底副現象，這種無中生有底見解和主觀的唯心論同樣是一偏之見。</p>
<p>其實心物本來一體。宇宙間沒有僅僅的心，也沒有僅僅的物，但有心物合一的個體。所謂心物合一，旣不是沒有分別的純一，也不是兩件東西底拚合，而是分殊之同一的合一。我們知道，一個個體是一個包含許多不同的部分和性質的全體。我們片斷地從其部分看就見其為物質；完整地從其全體底個體性看就　其為精神。心可以說就是這種全體精神底表現與自覺。部分與部分底關係是一種外在的，機械的，因果的關係；所以鮑桑克說，物質的系統是一個因果的系統。全體同一底關係是一種內在的，有機的，道理的關係；所以鮑桑克說，心是一個邏輯的系統。那麽心可以說是個體底內在性，物可以說是個體底外在；但內外相涵，心物不離；所以即內即外，即心即物。若尅就我們本身而言，從心之能表現於空問說，心就是神經系，從神經系之集中，精神向着統一的方向而努力說，神經系就是有限的心·因此若能善於了解，則謂心有物理的性格，物有心理的性格，本來也未嘗不可。但心畢竟佔主導的地位而有超越物質的力量。心可以說是物質系統底體性及其　義。譬如　樂為物質的絲竹振動底體性及其　義；針刺到我們底身體上，痛是刺入底體性，及其主義。意義是對於物質變化底一種解釋，牠雖有待於物質底變化，却並非物質單獨產生的結果。心與身底關係恰似音樂與絲竹，疼痛與針刺底關係·我們可以說，一念自覺則全體是心，一念昏沈則全身是物。</p>

<p>— 張其昀</p>
<p>區域主義</p>
<p>第一次火戰吿終之時，協約國大體接受了威爾遜總統的主張。一九一八年一月八日，威氏出席參衆兩院，詳陳作戰目的，共分十四條，即歷史上著名之十四點（Fourteen　Points），其第十四條為組織國際聯合會。「其宗旨為各國相互保障政治自由與領土完整，國無大小，一律亨受同等保障。」巴黎和會種種規定。雖有時顧及其他的考慮，但大體上確是本於此項原則，以釐定歐洲各國領土分配。所以第一次大戰後的歐洲，是許多民族國家所構成歐洲，中問不少是小國寡民。當時所重視的是民族的權利，而非區域的利益。我們回顧一九一九年至一九三九年的歐洲，這種重視弱小民族國家的試驗，可謂已經失敗。弱小民族絕無自衛能力，是大家一致公認的事實。我們並不否認小國對於世界的貢獻，如荷蘭興丹麥，便是顯著的例子。但是小國畢竟是小國，要想與各强國如美國蘇聯等立於平等地位，實在是不可能的事。本於過去的經臉，要使各民族都能獨立自由，並有充分發展的機會，於是區域主義的思想隨着二次大戰的浪潮應運而生了。</p>
<p>由小變大為世界新趨勢之一，世界政府非一朝一夕之事，經濟區域或地理區械介於民族與世界之間，可為促進大同的初步。區域組織與聯合國的組織實係相互為用，並行不悖。聯合國譬如第一道防綫，區域組織則為第二道防織，倘使第一道防綫失守，尙可退守第二道防綫。區域主義第一次大戰以後已經萌芽，當時歐洲著作家，已有歐洲國際社會的創議，旨在消弭各國間的糾紛，他們觀察美國英國及蘇聯發農是二種不可避免的趨勢。再以中國來比，中國版圖之大超過歐洲，中國久已成為統一的國家，歐洲何以不能？但國聯的時代正是小國極盛的時代，此類思想未被重視。第二次大戰發生以後，關於歐洲聯邦之著作已有多種。實際的政治家也有作鄭重的建議，一九四六年九月間邱吉爾在瑞士蘇黎世之演講，稱此種新幾構曰歐洲合衆國，由德法二國共同領導。他主張從速建立一解除武裝的新德國，俾與法國共同担負領道歐洲的責任。目前美蘇關係日趨緊張，歐洲的國際社會究將以何種方式出現，此時尙不可知。我們只看見一面有東歐的共產國際，一面有西歐的罵歇爾計劃，壁壘森嚴，互相敵視。但是從遠處看，何嘗不是趨向歐洲聯邦之重要步驟？區域主義目前也有已經實現的，如阿刺伯同盟即其佳例。該同盟為中東區域回敎諾國（包括埃及，叙利亞，黎巴嫩，阿刺伯，伊拉克，巴力斯坦，外約但等國）的新組合，在國際政治上已經自成為一外交單位。按中東區城以油田及戰略關係，率為英美蘇三國勢力接觸之地。假使回敎諸國能　實行互助，一致對外，可能成為一種安定因素。區域組織是世界安全系統之一部分，誠能以保境安民生產建設為主旨，可望消弭世界各區域的亂源。</p>
<h3 id="c173">釋老子「衆妙皮門」與「玄牝之門」 <a href="#c173" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e173" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">173</a></h3>
<p>— 嚴羣</p>
<p>老子第一章日：「道可道，非常道；名可名，非常名。無名，天地之始；有名，萬物之母。故常無欲，以觀其妙；常有欲，以觀其徼。此兩者同，出而異名。同，謂之玄；玄之又玄，衆妙之鬥」。其第六章日：「谷，神，不死，是謂玄牝。玄北之門，是謂天地根」。此可謂「衆妙之門」，「玄牝之門」，乃老子言「道」　　之所在，法家鮮得確解，輒於老子之「道」草窺其秘。不揣　陋，釋之如次，以質學者。</p>
<p>「可道」猶云可以言說。「常」者「獨立」，「不改」，「不殆」之謂；以今世術語出之，「獨立」猶云絕對，「不改」猶云不變，「不殆」猶云無差誤。「常道」，唯其　是三者之德，故焉衆道（即散著於萬物萬事之道）之道，即亦衆道之眞源。衆道，「非常道」。「非常道」曲，「常道」全。可言說者「非常道」，以其可思議故。夫思議者，比擬之功。以一曲之道互為比擬，然後思議之事集。「常道」，道之全，此外無道，即所謂一切在一切者，更有何物可與為比擬？必也自為比擬乎？自為比擬，非比擬也。無可比擬，則不可思議；不可思議者弗可言說，蓋言說，思議之形於言語者耳。「可名」猶言可立為名，可立為名之名，乃「非常名」，故日「名可名，非常名」也。蓋夫「常名」，必須是處，何則？「名」，所以指；指者，有所指，有所不指。或指或不指，必也有彼此之別乎。夫「常」，旣為一切在一切者，則無可為彼此之別，斯即無可指，而無所用乎「名」矣；是故「名」而曰「常」，特辭費已。「天地之始」猶云宇宙開闢之先，開闢之先「混而為一」，無所用乎名，故曰「無名，天地之始」。混一之道體判，而後萬物生；旣號為「萬」，斯有待於識別而指其彼此，不然，則是累累者復泯而為一矣，故曰「有名，萬物之母」。</p>
<p>「無欲」猶言無所祈禱；「妙」眇也，微也。眇而微者，官體所不能接，形而上之道也。「有欲」，有所祈嚮也。「徼」與「皦」形音近，意者即皦之譌。（第十四章曰：「其上不皦，其下不味。」）「繳」，明也，明者形而下之物若事；蓋唯有所分書，然後彼此之界域明，而分書出於有所祈嚮。無所祈嚮，正有以徵夫眇微之形而上之道，以其「周行不殆」，所謂體物無遺，無施而不可也；有所祈嚮，乃足以見形下之物若事之界域分明，所祈嚮乎此者必非所祈嚮乎彼也；故日「無欲，以觀其妙，有欲，以觀其徼」。「兩者」謂「無欲」，「有欲」；「此兩者同」，言「無欲」「有欲」同屬於此混一之道體：無所祈嚮乎，無所祈嚮於此道體也；有所祈響乎，有所祈嚮於此道體也；道體一而已，所以「同」也。「出而異名」，謂此道體以祈攔與判別之有無，而日「無欲」，「有欲」，「無名」，「有名」，「無」若「有」雖異名，而其實，則同此道體而已。「同」者形而上之「道」，「異」者形而下之「器」：（即所謂「物事」）「器」多「道」一，「器」繁「道」簡，「器」散「道」總。「道」之所以一，所以簡，所以總，以共玄故；「器」之所以多，所以繁，所以散，以其察故。「玄」者懸也，「懸」猶云懸虛，不囿於形體之謂。唯「道」能「玄」，唯「玄」乃「同」以其能一，能簡，能總，故也。「器」多而繁且散，一「道」可攝數「器」，是以「器」異「道」同。然此「道」亦有所攝所不攝，此即散著於萬物萬事之衆道，所謂「非常道」者已。「非常道」，以其能攝數「器」也，亦可謂之「玄」矣，顧其為「玄」，尤有淺深之程度存焉，則「玄」上有「玄」，以至夫其極，斯衆玄之所同歸，故曰「衆妙之門」。「妙」者眇微也，眇微言「玄」，形而上之道也；「衆妙」猶云衆這，所謂「非常道」者已。「門」者「常道」，「常道」攝一切「非常道」，而為其所指歸，故日「門」。</p>
<p>「谷」言虛，「神」謂因應無窮，「不死」謂不屈愈出，是三者之德為「玄牝」之所苞，故日「是謂玄牝」。「玄」懸也，「牝」虛也；唯懸虛者乃能谷，能神，能不死，唯「道」足以當之。顧散著於萬物萬事之道，所謂「非常道」者，亦俱些三者之德；如地心吸力之道不著（作附解，下同。）於某一下墜之物，豈不虛乎？有以攝一切下墜之事，豈不無窮乎？其攝夫下墜之事也，不失墜，無差誤，（即所謂無例外）豈非不屈乎？然此道之應物也，盡於下墜之事，他事則不逮，是猶有窮矣；不著於某一下墜之物，而囿於一切下墜之事，是猶有所著矣；於凡下墜之事不失無差，他事則不然，是猶有所屈矣。可知散著於萬物萬事之道，所謂「非常道」者，猶未極「玄牝」之能事，極「玄牝」之能事者，其唯衆道之道，所謂「常道」者乎？「常道」，「非常道」之所指歸，故曰「玄牝之門；「玄牝之門」，猶云：太玄者，衆玄之所自出也。故曰，「常道」，太玄也，是乃衆消衆玄之虞源，夫是之謂「天地根」。</p>

<h3 id="c174">利弊 <a href="#c174" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e174" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">174</a></h3>
<p>— 寄漠</p>
<p>筆者並不想搬弄「利即是弊，幣即是利」的這一套玄妙的理論，域者文字的游戲；不過，天下事並無錯對　利，正像天下事沒有絕對的弊一樣。</p>
<p>舉一個例來說：賭博是往往被正人君子們所詬病的，說它玩物喪志，為害無窮。然而問據一位愛玩「羅宋」的朋友吿訴我，拿到一副好牌，有好的拆法，拿到一副壞牌，也有壞的拆法，似乎頗能訓練「當機立決」和「從容不迫」的德性。</p>
<p>又如嚴守時間，能够予人良好印象，增加工作效率，不過在一個極端的例子中，即本談所記山本五十六陣亡的始末，他却因為遵守時間而遭盟軍飛機擊落。</p>
<p>提起山本五十六，述帶使人想起此次日本的戰敗，起初對它大為不利，現在却日漸似乎利多於弊了。筆者當在無綫電國外節目中，收聽東京的歌唱節目，咿咿呀呀的雖然不能懂得他們唱些什麽，但是音調鏗鏘，另有一種蓬勃生氣，與目下流行的「靡靡之音」自是不同。我們雖然不能肯定說這種音樂象徵何物，然而日本在麥帥管制之下，彷彿走上上坡路了。</p>
<p>至於個人對利弊的看法，更是因人而異，在大家愁眉蹙額為米價而驚心怵目時，在座的某君獨有怡然自得之狀。後來向人家一打聽，原來此公是開米店的。世界上的利弊，皆作如是觀可也。</p>
<h3 id="c175">閒話善男信女 <a href="#c175" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e175" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">175</a></h3>
<p>— 念鴻</p>
<p>上海原是一個複雜的都市，處處可以找到矛盾的地方，即使在人烟繁密車罵絡繹的南京路上，固然有大公司大飯店，終日生涯鼎盛，氣象萬千，但是相對的還有保安司徒廟，每天燒香求籤的人多多少少，擁擠不堪，遇着什麽菩薩的生日忌辰，更是盛况空前，善男信女擠了進去，就像敵偽時期買戶口米那樣，半天也望不見我佛如來的影子，往往只得將就些在門神天將前，燒些元寳蠟燭，叩頭了了心願。</p>
<p>其實南京路上有司徒廟也並不見得貽笑西方，要不然是也許會因整飭市容有礙國際觀瞻而給封掉的，因為近年來中國雖然也有天主敎耶穌敎等流傳廣播，但終不及佛敎的信徒衆多和根深蒂固，所以廟宇在都市中「畸形繁榮」，正如外國大都市中也有禮拜堂敎堂矗立一樣，象徵着宗敎建築之美。不但此也，由此更可顯示出東方古國的傳總宗敎信仰自由——中國人最自由的一種「自由」。</p>
<p>不僅保安司徒廟生意興隆，新城隍廟老城隍廟靜安守淸凉寺以及一切大小寺院包括什麽觀什麽宮在內，似乎都收入不惡，香火鼎盛。年內經濟不安定，市面不最氣，逢着年關節邊，往往聽說什麽呆大公司周轉不靈，某大工廠暫停開工，某大商店倒閉之類的風聲消息，但却從沒有聽到某某守某某廟因開支浩大而不能支打的新聞。有之，只記得好傻不久之前有二個和尙因爭奪主持廟產而引起的訴訟糾紛。從這裏推想，我們的少數民族資本家拚命支撑從事投資的一些小型輕工業，倒還不如關門大吉，把廠房翻造作為廟宇寺院。觀乎跑馬廳前右菩薩的盛况，瞭錢盈利却是有十二分把握的。</p>
<p>人對宗教的信仰，大多數還是從自私的觀點出發，第一類是像江洋大盜，在準備幹一下的前夕，使往往到菩薩前許下心願；投機商人很多默禱：如果菩薩保佑他投機成功的話，一定重造金身；諸如此類的情形，說得刻薄一點，簡直把泥塑木彫的神像，作為一個坐地分贓的東西；而據說佛敎敎義是戒用不義之財的，但是許多天神菩薩的身上五色泥金和香燭元寳，却大半帶着血腥味兒。第二類是人到了無路可走上夭不得入地無門的時候，才想起菩薩上帝，譬如對一切世事灰心的人便往往誦經念佛以了殘生，西洋人過着危急喊上帝與中國人遇着危急唸觀世音可以說出乎同一心理。但無論第一類第二類的信徒，總之只是些把生命孤注一擲的賭徒們和走頭無路的可憐虫。所謂「善男信女」，不過如是而已。</p>
<p>由此來看擁塞在廟宇內外的善男信女們，很淸楚的可以想像到這個社會的輸廓和內容。</p>
<h3 id="c176">燈草 <a href="#c176" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e176" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">176</a></h3>
<p>— 胡亞輝</p>
<p>燈下翻閱舊書，忽翻出一根細白的燈草來。</p>
<p>這燈草夾在　中的綠故，已經記不起了。舊書是從鄉問帶來的，想是鄉間還用靑油燈的時候，隨手在燈盤下拿來用，以當作書籤的吧？——這燈草倒也有不少年了。</p>
<p>細看燈草，細長潔白如故，並無損傷。是這根燈草的幸運吧，能被夾在書本中，保持原來的面目。</p>
<p>靑油燈早被人們所廢素，燈草也將絕跡了，今天能偶然在書本中翻到牠，彷彿遇見故人一般，感到萬分親熱。牠曾做過我多年的好伴，在牠的光亮之下，我讀完了不少的書，得到了不少的啓示。</p>
<p>可是在使用洋油燈，電燈的現在，牠不再被人們所重視了。時代的更新，牠是落伍了。因此我為牠感到悲哀。牠也曾焚去自身放過光明的，照過每個角落，也照過人們的眼睛；即是現在牠仍能放光，在黑暗裏，他還是人們的救星。是人們忘記了牠？抑是牠辜負了人們？我替牠悲憤！我為牠申訴！</p>
<p>寫到這裏，我記起一首誰做的詠燈草的詩來，現在把牠記下來，就算作這篇小文的結尾：「賦質輕柔秉性良，持身潔白等秋霜，但能世界光明現，赴火蹈湯總不妨。」（為懷念栩師而作）</p>
<h3 id="c177">閒話火箭 <a href="#c177" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e177" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">177</a></h3>
<p>— 毛毅</p>
<p>火箭被稱為這次火戰中的「神童」。假如眞是如此的話，那麽蕭伯納祗能算是一個初露頭角的作家，愛因斯坦也僅不過是一個前述有望的小科學家而已了。我們不否認火箭武器的重要性；我們也不懷疑將來的火箭會携帶人類到地球的任何一隅，甚至到另外一個星球上去。但是我們難以默認火箭是二十世紀的科學所孕育的「神童」。因為，這在十九世紀初的拿破崙之戰中，英國人已在使用火箭武器了。</p>
<p>火箭的準確性一直未能完好的建立。所以，當前兩年有人在火箭的尾部火門裝置特殊的設備使之旋轉而增進準確性的時候，科學家們都衆口一詞的譽之為「空前的發明」。不錯，旋轉火箭是一種重大的改進。但是，這是空前的創舉嗎？不，我們不該忘記一百年以前的墨西哥戰爭中，已有旋轉火箭在發施咸力了。</p>
<p>在一八〇五年，常拿破崙稱覇歐陸而想轉鋒入侵英倫的時候，英國威廉·康格里伍爵士的戰爭火箭擊碎了他的美夢。這些火箭在一八〇六年擊毀了已黎附近的布倫，在一年之後又摧毀丹麥京城哥本哈根，使拿破崙為了防衛後方而不敢渡越海峽。後來，火箭也被英軍用來攻擊法國艦隊：在柯達斯，但澤，萊比錫諾役之中，火箭亦曾發揮威力。</p>
<p>當一八一二年英美戰爭爆發之時，英軍之中有一個火箭旅，在布拉登斯堡擊潰了美國的瑪麗蘭義勇軍，得以直指華盛頓城。在麥克亨利堡的爭奪戰中，英國也是利用火箭而佔優勢的。</p>
<p>不過，康格里伍的火箭還是未成熟的武器。它們是不安全的，並且完全是無定向的。當時，每一隻火箭都被縛在一根十五呎長的柱子上，使它朝着近似的正確方向。它們雖有優點，可是，也有許多限制。有不少國家都從事火箭的改進工作。到了一八四六年，美國人威廉·海爾發明第一隻旋轉火箭，解決了準確性的問題。他利用火箭自身所發生的熱氣斜噴到尾部的三個彎曲的翼上，使火箭在飛行之中發生旋轉。旋轉火箭的命中率比初期的火箭高明得多。</p>
<p>海爾的火箭經過美國軍部的正式試騐之後，就在華盛頓兵工廠開始製造。當時的出品計有大小兩種，小的一種直徑和現在美軍所有的巴蘇卡平射砲的口徑相同；大的則直徑多一吋，射程有二千二百碼。為了使用這種新武器，美國組織了火箭軍團。它們不久就參與了墨西哥戰爭。一團在維拉克魯茲登陸，另一團則帮助攻繫墨西哥京城附近的查普德柏卡堡。由於軍事的順利進展，火箭軍團的聲名大著。可惜，軍事當局祗熱中於歌頌勝利，忘記將火箭本身的功効給紀錄下來。</p>
<p>听以，我們說火箭不是新發明，旋轉火箭也不是新玩意。推溯得更遠一點，威康·康格里伍的火箭還是向印度人模傲來的。在十八世紀末的英國　印戰爭中，印軍不止一次的使用火箭反擊英軍。這消息傳到了倫敦，麥蘇爾王子的印度火箭軍團的成功刺激了康格里伍，使他在十九世紀初成了聞名的軍器家。而誰又能够肯定的說火箭是於兩世紀前在印度出世？它也許還有更要悠久的歷史呢！所以，我不汝認火箭是二十世紀的新發明，雖然近代的火箭比古代的更巧妙，更精緻，更有効。</p>

<p>— 陳慎言</p>
<p>第十二章　萍水姻緣（九二）</p>
<p>綺紈見他說話很從容，很文雅，在這無聊鬱悶之中，能得這樣一位佳客，足以打破寂寞。當下二人倚在欄杆前，彼此把在舞台和銀幕上的一經驗，互相討論，愈談愈有味，一直談了好幾個鋒頭，才回屋內。綺紈覺得這人風流倜儻，比渚齊還勝一籌。凡是一個人，在百無聊賴之際，突然來了一位富有刺激的友人，給他解除苦悶，給他言語安慰，所給　好印象，便會永永深刻在他腦中，綺紈連日在憂鬱　喪之中，一點精神提不起來，今天和島雲一談，死灰似的心苗油然又萌生趣，覺得一個人在社會上，不能侷促一地，要四方奔走，自謀生存。此次為一時氣忿，竟圖呑金自盡，當時若是竟死了，社會未必能予同情，甚至還看惡批評加到身上，現在回想起來，這種舉動太魯莽，太無知識了。剛才聽島雲談到上海劇界的情形，自已若是肯到上海露演，未嘗不可一露頭角，我又何必老守在北平，換個環境，精神上也覺愉快。綺紈想到這裏，很想到島雲病房裏，再細行討論，只為今天初次目面，夜　到他病房，似乎不便。一時又想島雲的言動舉止，很有幾分像渚齋，和他談談說說，倒有意思，他從事銀幕，業已多年，經驗宏富，和他討論藝術，與我也有許多好處。這一夜綺紈躺在床上，顚顚倒倒，想了一回，也就睡去。到第二早醒來，起來不久，便聽門外輕輕敲門的聲音，綺紈在屋內說一聲請進，島雲已應聲推門進來。祗見他已把醫院給他穿的病人白大褂脫下，換了一身極漂亮的西服，益顯得丰神俊逸，一進門便向綺紈鞠了一躬，微微笑道：「原來顧小姐已經起來了。我今天一淸早就到院內，見顧小姐沒出來，以為你不舒服，特來君你。」綺紈笑道：「我沒什麽不舒服，因為昨晚沒有睡好，今天起晚了。」島雲道：「我昨天也很晚才睡。」說着，向綺紈看了一眼，綺紈覺得他這話似有所指，臉上不禁微現紅暈，很想吿訴他，昨晚想到他屋裏談心，祇是不便出口。</p>
<h3 id="c179">夏禹不是一條蟲了 <a href="#c179" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e179" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">179</a></h3>
<p>— 孫鶴</p>
<p>顧頡剛敎授是我國古史學權威，許多着作裏都有驚人之論，他以疑古之眼來看一切典籍，遂於二十多年前發出「萬是一條蟲」的結論。</p>
<p>學術界曾經引起很多人的驚異，一部人對之作懷疑的懷疑，有人則認為顧先生此說的荒誕而作峻刻的諷刺，魯迅先生便是一個，這，曾經刺激了顧先生，為之大怒，寫了一封信給任敎中山大學的魯迅先生，請他不要離開廣州，因為他認為這是莫大的侮辱，等候他來起訴開審。終於魯迅先生並未遵命等待，只是回敬了一頓諷刺而去。顧先生也就沒有進行訴訟，否則為了學術上的歧見而對簿公庭，倒是學術史上一件佳話。</p>
<p>魯迅先生死後的第十年（民國卅四年），我們却在顧韻剛先生在重慶主編的文史雜誌古代史專號的社論上，發現了如下一段——</p>
<p>我們的古代史，孔子時便已感到夏殷文獻不足。到了孔子後連西周的文戲也感不足了，所以我們要想研究上古的史實，不能單靠幾本士書，只有盡力從事於考古學，努力向地下發掘遺物，傑英國人之考求埃及古史一樣。遺物固然也很零碎，但總是當時的實物，是直接的材料，不像古書那樣，經過多少次的傳鈔重編，發生許多後起的煩瑣問題。四十年來遺物之經發現者業已不少，只要我們肯耐煩，從那遺物的本身上細心探去，未必不能憑我們的想懈搭起一個系統來。（中略）不過就我們現在業經發掘的遣物看來，尙只能探索殷商的歷史，對於夏王國仍覺得很茫昩，雖然夏的存在已是無可懷疑，但夏的歷史還不容易着手，鋼器出了許多，沒有一件夏的東西·古文字發現得不少，沒有一件是夏人寫的。沒有銅器，是不是他們尙滯留在新石器時代？沒有夏的文字，是不是那時尙未有文字，抑尙未發現？提到這些問題，我們眞是茫昧得很，文獻不足，遺物無存，不能憑空臆斷。所以截至現在為止，我們的古代史只能從殷商寫起，商以前的史事仍舊要靠考古學家們繼續努力去搜求。</p>
<p>顧先生雖然藉論語上孔子說的「夏禮吾能言之，杞不足徵也」，以示「一條蟲」說並非太荒唐，但畢竟頗有悔「少作」之意，畢竟否定了過去鑽故紙堆而不憑實物的治學功夫。而且肯定「夏的存在已是無可懷疑」，特別反覆承認自己對夏史的「茫昧」，毫無文過飾非之意，這在治學上的進步精神是値得大書特書的。對於當年要打官司的事，顧先生也許會自己失笑的吧。</p>
<h3 id="c180">拜金社會 <a href="#c180" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e180" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">180</a></h3>
<p>— 允恭</p>
<p>在筆者讀過的記不盡的歐美小說中，十餘十前讀過的一篇，在我的印象中，特別深刻，大意謂，富家子某甲，為測驗世態炎涼計，特地披了一件破舊的大氅，出席某次宴會，到會的賓客，却對他投射鄙棄的限光，受盡奚落。他却徐徐將大　脫下，裏面的服裝，打扮得煥然一新，佩帶的飾物，價値通城。於是衆人又爭相奉承，一反原來的「拉長面孔」了。</p>
<p>這小說自然是旨在諷世的，恐怕未必有此實事。但是拜金社會的可憎處在此，可愛處也在此。</p>
<p>小也者，只要足下衣服筆挺，皮鞋雪亮，無論乘電軍，或買東西，到處受人尊敬和歡迎。賣票員決不會努眉攒目的推推你說：「票子呢？」他一定說：先生，你有票子嗎？」</p>
<p>朋友某公更和我談起一件買胡椒的小事。原來敝友某一天忽有吃麵的雅興，等到麵煮熱後，又忽想吃胡椒，就信步走到街角的一家藥材店中，向店夥索購五千元的胡椒。店夥對他不修邊幅的衣服看了一眼，冷冷的說：「一萬元起買！」結果某君用戴了一克拉鑽戒的手，拿五千元鈔票，對他揮揮，賭氣不買了。</p>
<p>據說，南美洲的古巴人，以衣服為第一生命，飲食尙居其次。一個襯衫熨得雪白，頭髪梳得油亮的古巴人，肚子却未必吃飽。在這拜金社會中，古巴人似乎是不可為而可為的。</p>
<h3 id="c181">聯話 <a href="#c181" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e181" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">181</a></h3>
<p>— 陳雪學園</p>
<p>現代學者甚重民間文學，常於「言之不文」的文字，得重大之收穫。昨讀申報（二十五）又得妙聯一副，其可供研究之價値，有過於香港李將軍的大作（二十四）。那位西安寓公的春聯是「我們住房太得貴」，「和錢要漲十四倍」，門額是「住不起」三字，此亦發牢騷之一類，我想見者或以為俚語村言，縱然同情他的「不平之鳴」，對於此聯之製作，定多付之一笑。</p>
<p>然而此等對聯確能代表一部分「民間文學」，並足供中西文學組織之參考。</p>
<p>第一須注意的，他這兩句上下字數一律，分貼兩旁，有整齊相並之形體，已具對聯的基本條件。第二則注意他上下句裏字樣，全不相對，沒有搆成對聯的主要條件（偶文），但他却用另一個不必要的條件（叶韻）作為完成對聯的紐織之要素。這自然是錯誤，對聯是一種「偶文」，並非「韻語」，不能用「韻」來作「歐」的替代，所以「貴」與「倍」之相　，毫無意義，自不待言。但在他則「字數相均」之外，又「聲韻相協」，於是「叶韻」也算多了一個構成的條件，他卻滿足了。</p>
<p>以「韻」代「偶」雖不合理，但不能「一笑了之」，且須承認有此一體無理之理，不偶而偶的對聯。現在就「民間」及「西譯」兩方而來脫：</p>
<p>小說，冒詞，亂彈戲本皆是通俗的作品，大衆的鑒賞物。亂彈戲裏有所謂「念對子」者，即不對之對，往往以「韻」代「偶」，如惡　村學中澲天離念上句：「誠官　比籠中島」，武天虬念下句「諒他插翅也難逃」；如瓊林宴鬧府葛登雲念上句「葛虎此去莫追悔」，葛虎接下句「管取鋼刀見血回」。此名「下塲對」，場上人將下場時念此，以資結東。（上述係兩人分念，若塲上只一人，亦可自念兩句者，中塲及上塲亦有用者，今不備舉。）而小說中，一個階段結束處，如「踏破鐵鞋無覓處」，「得來全不費工夫」，皆是此類，上下句不「偶」而韻，即算「對子」。又有些「偶」而兼「韻」的，如「計就月中擒玉兔」，「謀成日裏捉金島」；如「踏破下　飛彩鳳」，「頓開金鎖走較龍」其　而雖對而兩句同義，是為「合掌」，在偶文中亦是下乘。然在民衆的製作技術上，對偶實比叶韻為南。能對亦是粗略的對法，不能對就用「韻」來凑合凑合，假使連「額」都弄不好，則只字數相同也就算了，如「滿懷心腹事」，「盡在不言中」，亦呌做「對子」。由此可以得到如下之結論：</p>
<p>（一）一種心情，用文字宣達於衆，最好是用對聯的方式貼出去，這是基於自然的要求。方體單音的國文，即是很現成的優良條件。</p>
<p>（二）上下句字數相均，貼出去左右分張，便有對聯的資格。</p>
<p>（三）能全體配成偶文那是頂好，如實在對不上則以「韻」代「偶」，亦算多了一層製作工夫。</p>
<p>其次說到西譯。西譯的中國著作很多，因方體單音字與聯體拼音字的格格不相入，使通譯的工作不但困難，而且有些重要地方，根本上陷於不可能。最顯著的則是偶文對句，例如聊齊志異的</p>
<p>有花有酒春長在，</p>
<p>無月無燈月自明。</p>
<p>這樣一組一組成雙作對的上下句，譯以長短不齊的西字，是何景象，不難預知。但譯者似乎有了辦法，英譯聊齋這兩句是：</p>
<p>With　wine　and　flowerswe　chase　the　hours，</p>
<p>In　one　eternal　Ｓpring；</p>
<p>No　moon　no　light　to　cheer　the　night，</p>
<p>Thyself　that　ray　must　bring．</p>
<p>成為一首很好的短詩，渾身是「韻」，句是「叶韻」，簡是「疊韻」，鏗鏘動聽，朗朗上口，雖然韻調十足，怎奈無法配成偶文。雖然不是偶文，上下兩句又分為長短四行，大致勻整，亦就只可如此了，其苦心孤詣，與我國民衆之以「韻」代「偶」者，可算同病相憐。我國民衆之以「韻」代「偶」，是人的作文程度不够，或者根本沒有用過對偶文的心。西人之以「韻」代「偶」，則是他們的文字，根本無對偶之可能。他們所謂Couplet只要兩個句子（或詞）意義形態似乎成為「一雙」的樣兒，但永不能有對聯，其Couplet亦不能分張或分懸，如中國的門對及協帖之式。</p>

<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 8th] The Northeast Petition Delegation, consisting of Wang Huayi, Zhang Baozi, Li Zhonghua, and Tian Yushi, paid a visit to Chairman Chiang at 4:00 PM on the 8th to present their case. In addition to submitting a written statement outlining four demands, they also provided detailed accounts of the situation and difficulties in the Northeast. The discussion lasted for one hour, concluding at 5:00 PM. Chairman Chiang gave the most satisfactory responses to the delegation's four proposals: reinforcement, food transport, youth education, and currency reform. Furthermore, deeply concerned about the plight of the people in the Northeast, the Chairman repeatedly emphasized the importance of cooperation between the military and the civilians, stressing that the central government would never abandon the Northeast, stating: "Ensuring the Northeast is the foundation of the nation; the government is fully determined. We have already increased troop deployments to strengthen military forces, and the situation will gradually improve." The Chairman's firm tone left the delegation with a favorable impression. (The Chairman's personal assurance to the Northeast Petition Delegation regarding the reform of the Northeast currency system and the results of discussions with the Social Affairs, Communications, and Education departments regarding strengthening relief efforts are published in the second column of the second page.)</p>
<p>[Our Pan Yang Dispatch, 8th] The Battle of Siping has reached its climax. The bandits, with the main force of six columns and two independent divisions from North Manchuria, launched a general offensive on the 7th. The Third Column took on the frontal attack, with the Tiexi District (west of the railway) being the first to be repelled. The Nationalist army is in the Tiedong District (east of the railway), east of Tianqiao. According to the past experience of the Siping campaign, the Nationalist army achieved final victory in Tiedong, but this time the situation is different from the past, yet this can still buy time. Communication between Siping and Shenyang was lost for a time on the 7th but was restored on the 8th. On the 8th, the air force also made its best effort to reconnoiter and bomb the attacking bandits, and communication was established with the defending troops in Tiedong District. According to reports, although the defending troops are in a difficult situation, they are very brave. Furthermore, in Benxi, southeast of Shenyang, the situation is even better. Reinforcements arrived on the 7th. A certain unit, with a small number of troops, has held the Waitoushan station for more than twenty days. The Benxi garrison launched a corresponding counterattack, and met up with the reinforcements in Waitoushan, and are making continued efforts. In order to reverse the decline, the bandits in Anshan are also moving in that direction.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 8th] The fighting outside of Siping is still proceeding intensely. The previous report that Siping had fallen to the bandits was a mistake for Siping Airport falling to the bandits. On the 6th, the airport was heavily damaged by intense artillery fire in many places and could not be used. In order to concentrate firepower, the Nationalist army withdrew from the suburbs. On the 7th, the bandit army disregarded death and charged towards the strongholds of Boluo Linzi, Hai Wan Tun, and others dozens of times throughout the day, but they were all bravely repelled by the Nationalist army, with piles of corpses left behind, and they ultimately failed to succeed. Currently, the bandits in the area more than thirty kilometers outside of Changchun are moving frequently, attempting to resist the Nationalist army's southward advance, but the strong Nationalist forces in that area are still acting according to the predetermined plan.</p>
<p>[Our Beiping Dispatch, 8th] The situation in Rehe Province is expected to improve soon. Before Zhu takes office, Fan Hanjie will first clear the eastern Rehe corridor. Yu Guozhen, the director of the Civil Affairs Department, will come to Beiping in a day or two to meet with Fan Hanjie to determine the plan for the military and political development.</p>

<p>[Our Dongtai Urgent Dispatch, 8th] (1) After the Communist bandits in northern Jiangsu suffered a setback from the Nationalist army's resistance on the Grand Canal line, they regrouped the remnants of the Eleventh and Twelfth Columns and, on the night of the 6th, advanced from the coastal area and the border of Yandong towards Dongtai County. The Nationalist army and local units stationed there calmly responded to the attack, and the invaders suffered heavy casualties. Around 1:00 AM on the 7th, about four regiments of the bandit Eleventh Column launched another full-scale attack on the northeastern positions of the county seat, dividing into six routes and engaging in fierce fighting in the area around the county seat's automobile bridge, Erli Bridge, and Donghong Bridge. The bandit army launched a fierce attack on the county seat with dense artillery fire, but was ultimately repelled by the Nationalist army's superior firepower. That night, more than 2,000 bandits were killed. (2) On the night of the 7th, a part of the bandit Eleventh and Twelfth Columns advanced towards Su Yindun, Han Jia Yao, Lao Ba, Beiguan Bridge, and other places in the northwest corner of Dongtai County. After more than two hours of fierce fighting, the bandits were unable to withstand the attack and collapsed. (3) The bandit Qintong Independent Regiment, Xinghua Independent Regiment, Lao Si Regiment, and Xin Liu Regiment, on the night of the 7th, coordinated with the bandits attacking Dongtai, launching five attacks on Xixi and Shanghai’s warehouses, three kilometers away from Dongtai County, but were all bravely repelled by the Nationalist army and local forces. The Nationalist army is now strengthening fortifications and awaiting reinforcements.</p>
<p>[Our Zhenjiang Urgent Dispatch, 8th] The remnants of the Eleventh and Twelfth Columns of bandits, along with the Xinghua and Cheng two independent regiments and the Old Fourth Regiment and the New Sixth Regiment, attacked Dongtai County on the night of the 6th. As of the morning of the 8th, they had attacked the county seat more than ten times, but were valiantly and fiercely struck by the Nationalist army and self-defense forces stationed there, killing and wounding more than 3,000 bandits. The bandits ultimately failed. The Nationalist army is continuing to search and suppress the remnant bandits in the suburbs. Furthermore, the Nationalist army reinforcing Dongtai is advancing rapidly along both the Tongyu Highway and the Grand Canal, and an annihilation war will be launched along the Tongyu line.</p>
<p>[Our Zhenjiang Dispatch, 8th] In the border area of Yancheng, Dongtai, and Xinghua, small groups of bandits infiltrated on the 7th, and land and water transportation to Dongtai was cut off. Xinghua County is still holding firm.</p>
<p>[Our Huaiyin Dispatch, 7th] As of the afternoon of the 7th, the Chen bandits' Second Column, fleeing south, had not yet taken concrete action. Furthermore, in order to contain the Nationalist army's forces, a part of the bandit Twelfth Column attempted to move south along the Tongyu line from the 4th, spying on the bandit trails in Dongtai. It was discovered very close to the northeast of Dongtai, and a strong Nationalist army unit is intercepting them from the south of Yancheng.</p>
<p>[Our Xuzhou Dispatch, 8th] The Chen Yi bandits' Second and Seventh Columns, fleeing north of Shuyang, continued to flee to the northwest area of Lianshui yesterday, along with factory machinery and dependents. The Nationalist army is deploying a large force to suppress the bandits.</p>

<p>[Our Xuzhou Dispatch, 8th] The elite Nationalist army units in eastern Henan continued to launch fierce offensives against the bandits, sweeping all before them. On the 7th, they successively recaptured the four county seats of Taikang, Huaiyang, Tongxu, and Fugou, and brought the entire diamond-shaped area between the four counties under control. The remnants of Chen Yi's bandits' First, Third, Sixth, and Eighth Columns crossed the Longhai Railway near the Liuhe train station yesterday and fled back to western Shandong. The eastern Henan area has transitioned from the pursuit and suppression stage to the pacification stage.</p>

<p>[Our Zhengzhou Dispatch, 8th] In the Longmen southeast area of Luoyang, outpost skirmishes occurred on the 7th. One or two thousand bandits, disturbing in the direction of Heishi Pass in Yanshi, retreated after the Nationalist army put pressure on their flanks. They are currently seeking favorable areas to fight, so no fighting has occurred at present.</p>

<p>The Security Authorities Are Closely Monitoring</p>
<p>[Our Hangzhou Dispatch, 8th] According to intelligence obtained by the provincial government, there are two bandit steamships and more than ten vessels near Taihu Platform Mountain, equipped with machine guns and other weapons, seemingly searching for a base of operations, in preparation for the bandits' "May Crossing the River" conspiracy. The security authorities are closely monitoring.</p>

<h3 id="e10">Two Mysterious Guests Suddenly Arrive in the Old Capital; After a Four-Month Trek from Outer Mongolia to Peiping; Rumored to Be Planning to Go to the United States to Request Powerful Assistance <a href="#e10" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c10" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">10</a></h3>
<p>[Our Beiping Dispatch, 7th] (Zhou Dao) The Xihu Hotel in the old capital recently received two mysterious guests from Outer Mongolia via Zhangjiakou. Reporters made several attempts to interview them, but were unsuccessful. According to a Zhangjiakou dispatch in the North China Daily, they are two Outer Mongolian military officers who trekked for four months to reach Zhangjiakou. They are planning to go to New York to request powerful assistance from the United States for Outer Mongolia, so that Outer Mongolia can achieve true independence. It is said that one is named Du You Ali Ge, who studied education in the Soviet Union and served as a company commander in the Outer Mongolian internal defense team before leaving Outer Mongolia. The other is named Nawazhamusu, who studied military affairs in the Soviet Union. He was a colonel instructor in the entertainment corps, but they are wearing uniforms with blue corner sleeve trim and collar trim, which should be officer uniforms. Their journey south is full of legendary qualities. They escaped from Outer Mongolia to Suo Chang, where they met Yun Ze's younger brother, Yun Pu (head of the economic department of the Inner Mongolia government), and took out their own medals, saying they were awarded by the Outer Mongolian Prime Minister, Balanzhater. They were constantly called Outer Mongolian staff members along the way, and their travel permits were all written by themselves in pen or pencil. They easily passed through the Communist bandit checkpoints to Dolun, and then from Dolun to Zhangjiakou. They were recently escorted to Peiping by the Chahar Province Mongolian Banner Welfare Committee and relevant parties. It is said that yesterday (the 6th) they went to the western suburbs to meet Commander-in-Chief Chuan, but to journalists, they remain a mysterious enigma.</p>

<p>[Our Hankou Dispatch, 8th] The Wuhan Clothing Factory worker strike, which has been deadlocked for ten days, is finally coming to an end through dissolution. The Investigation Office of the Garrison Headquarters, believing that the workers have been delaying resuming work and are attempting to cross the line and riot, arrested 458 worker representatives who were inciting the strike at 2:00 AM last night. After interrogation, eight of them were released on bail. This morning at 8:00 AM, hundreds of family members and children of the arrested workers, carrying incense and clothing, went to the Pacification Headquarters to petition, demanding the release of the arrested workers and permission to send them clothing first. After officials from the Pacification Headquarters were sent to persuade and guide them, they still gathered at the gate for a long time. It was not until 3:00 PM that hundreds of armed police suppressed them, and they dispersed. Afterwards, according to Liu Yinggu, Chief of Staff of the Pacification Headquarters, regarding the workers' strike at the factory, the workers' demands had been accepted, and they were allowed to increase their wages from 14,000 times to 20,000 times, in accordance with the standards of Nanjing and Shanghai. It was also recommended to the Joint Logistics Headquarters to readjust them separately according to the treatment of army technicians. However, after the workers expressed their acceptance, they still did not resume work, and this morning at 5:00 AM, they gathered 200 people to loot rice from the warehouse and attempt to continue the riot. In view of their actions, it was clear that they were being manipulated by treacherous bandits, so an order was issued to dissolve all the workers in accordance with the telegram from General Chen and the actual situation. Worker registration is currently being re-conducted, and active preparations are being made to resume work.</p>

Many policemen were seriously injured, and 29 perpetrators were arrested.

<p>The proposal is to be submitted to the Yuan's plenary session to complete the legislative procedure</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 8th] The Foreign Affairs and Finance Committees of the Legislative Yuan held a joint meeting on the morning of the 8th, chaired by Zhang Zhaoyuan, to discuss and approve the exchange of notes and attachments of the "Sino-Hong Kong Customs Anti-Smuggling Agreement", and to submit them to the Yuan's plenary session for legislative procedure. Although this agreement was signed on January 21 of this year, and stipulated that it would take effect immediately, because our customs preparations were not yet complete, it has not yet been formally implemented, and the Hong Kong government has not yet submitted it to the Legislative Council for approval. It is therefore believed that the Executive Yuan should be advised to instruct the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to urge the Hong Kong side to handle it quickly, so that the agreement can be implemented as soon as possible to curb smuggling in South China.</p>

<h3 id="e20">Martin Insists on Military Aid to China, Chennault Arrives in Washington and Testifies Immediately, American Newspapers Urge the Government to Quickly Clarify its Position on Policy Toward China <a href="#e20" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c20" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">20</a></h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 7th] House Speaker Martin stated that the House of Representatives will insist on providing weapons and financial aid to China. Martin said, "Financial aid to China is useless without the support of weapons." Martin had previously expressed support for military aid to China, but never with such strong wording as today. Several influential members of the House, led by Judd, believe that using weapons to combat the Communists should be the top priority of aid to China. Some members believe that China should receive at least one billion dollars, including both military and civilian aid.</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 8th] General Chennault arrived here today with his wife and will soon appear before the House Foreign Affairs Committee to state his views on the aid to China bill.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Washington, 7th] The Washington Sunday Star, in its editorial on the 7th, strongly urged American civilian and military officials to issue a most authoritative statement clarifying their attitude, in order to clear up the confusion in the minds of the American public and Congress regarding military aid to China. The article pointed out that "Wedemeyer and MacArthur both strongly urge providing this kind of aid to China, while Marshall is clearly unwilling to do so," and then asked, "Which of these two factions is right?" The newspaper continued, "Before the American people can understand who is right and who is wrong, they must be informed of these opinions. It is time to issue a most authoritative statement clarifying our attitude, based on the consensus of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, the State Department, and the White House." The newspaper emphasized that all considerations require prioritizing aid to Europe, but this does not mean that China can be ignored.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Washington, 8th] Well-informed sources predict that although the State Department opposes military aid to China, the United States will provide the Chinese government with substantial military assistance within a few months.</p>
<p>Although government officials strongly state that there are currently no plans for military aid to China, and that China has already received surplus American military supplies; however, as a result of the trend in Congress and general public opinion, military aid to China is still likely to be realized. The best-informed observers believe that, regardless of whether the State Department will automatically change its position, Congress will in fact include military aid in the aid to China plan, regardless of Marshall's hope that aid to China will be limited to goods and construction materials.</p>
<p>Well-informed observers point out that there are several factors that are increasing the possibility of the United States providing the Nanjing government with more military equipment every day. One factor is the rapid deterioration of the National Army's military position; another factor is General MacArthur and General Wedemeyer's indication to the House Foreign Affairs Committee that military aid is the only way to solve the China problem.

<h3 id="e21">Prospects for Sino-Thai Relations <a href="#e21" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c21" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">21</a></h3>
<p>The new government of Siam has been officially recognized by our government since the 6th of this month, and countries such as Britain, the United States, and France have also restored diplomatic relations with Siam. This is a matter worth noting.</p>
<p>Since the coup in Siam on November 9th last year, the interim government organized by Khuang Aphaiwong has not been recognized by China, Britain, and the United States. Even the United Nations Far East Economic Conference has refused to allow Siamese representatives to attend. However, "non-recognition" is a political means, not a permanent state of diplomacy. As long as the "non-recognized" country improves its internal affairs, promotes good neighborliness, the environment can be improved. Therefore, in order to avoid isolation and strive for recognition by various countries, the Siamese government, in accordance with the provisions of the new constitution, held a general election on the 29th of this month and established a new parliament. Khuang Aphaiwong, the leader of the Democratic Party, won the popular election and was ordered to form a cabinet on February 20th, which was approved by the lower house on the 5th of this month. The first thing Khuang did after forming the cabinet was to notify various countries, declaring that the Siamese government would fully fulfill all its international obligations, especially hoping that Sino-Thai relations would be restored as soon as possible. The Chinese government, in view of the fact that the Siamese government after the popular election is a legitimate government unanimously supported by its people, decided to recognize the new Siamese government from March 6th and restore normal diplomatic relations between China and Siam. Our ambassador to Siam, Li Tieh-cheng, will soon return to his post, and the newly appointed Siamese ambassador to China will also come to China to take office. According to news from Bangkok, Siamese Prime Minister Khuang expressed great satisfaction with our country's rapid recognition of his leadership; Britain, the United States, France, the Netherlands, and other countries also took action at the same time to restore diplomatic relations with Siam. From then on, the Siamese political situation and Sino-Thai relations have cleared away the clouds and gradually brightened.</p>
<p>Siam is a small country in Southeast Asia, but its geographical position is important and its agricultural products are abundant. Its relationship with China is interdependent. The total population of Siam is 15 million, and there are 3.5 million overseas Chinese, accounting for more than one-fifth. In Bangkok, the capital of Siam, Chinese people account for about 80%, which is enough to reflect the close relationship between China and Siam. The Chinese have made great contributions to the prosperity of Siam through immigration. Historical Siamese books record in detail that Siam was once a desolate place. Since Chinese scholars came by wind and waves, they have been diligent and hardworking, reclaimed land, built civil works, developed trade, and cooperated with the Siamese people to build today's paradise, which has improved the living standards of the Siamese people due to economic prosperity. Unfortunately, in the past half century, a few Siamese have forgotten history and opposed the overseas Chinese in every possible way, creating many unfortunate events. However, Siamese narrow-minded racialists, despite rejecting overseas Chinese with nationalism, have done everything possible to kill, exile, and confiscate property, but the victimized overseas Chinese have always been able to endure and forgive, adhering to the spirit of generosity, which has moved many enlightened and progressive Siamese people, who have been friendly and harmonious. Despite the rise of Siamese totalitarian politics several times, fascists such as Luang Phibunsongkhram's rule have recklessly advocated "Greater Thaiism," threatened overseas Chinese, enacted laws, and used violence to destroy overseas Chinese education and media, but the victimized overseas Chinese have been open-minded, selfless, and purely exchanged their labor for a living, without any political, economic, or territorial ambitions, and have ultimately been understood and recognized by enlightened and progressive Siamese people. The current Siamese Prime Minister, Khuang Aphaiwong, has a long-standing understanding of Sino-Thai relations and the position of overseas Chinese. His moderate attitude has won the trust of overseas Chinese. Khuang is an ideal bridge for this restoration of Sino-Thai relations and the future development of Sino-Thai relations.</p>
<p>Khuang Aphaiwong is a moderate advocate of cooperation and has formed a cabinet three times. The Democratic Party led by Khuang is centered on the middle class and was once an enemy of Phibunsongkhram, but later compromised with him. The coup in November last year was due to the dissatisfaction of the Siamese right-wing with the status quo and to curb the rise of communism, so they did not hesitate to use "coup d'état." In order to appease international public opinion and suppress the agitated public sentiment, Luang Phibunsongkhram supported Khuang Aphaiwong to form an interim government to mediate the opposing forces at home and abroad. In the past four months, Khuang has made contributions to internal suppression, but has gained nothing in easing relations with other countries, so he has requested to resign twice. On January 29th, the Democratic Party won the election, and Khuang formed a cabinet for the fourth time, advocating improving internal affairs, implementing democracy, and promoting good neighborly relations, which has won the understanding of various countries. Various countries have always held a loving attitude towards Siam. First, they hope that Siam's political progress will lead to external peace; second, they hope that enlightened democratic politicians in Siam will rise to abandon narrow-minded racialism with cosmopolitanism; third, they hope that Siam will contribute to the revival of the Far East economy. Now that Khuang has formed a cabinet, since he advocates internal democracy and external good neighborliness, various countries have recognized him, and we have unlimited hopes for the new Siamese government. For the sake of the future of peace in Southeast Asia, we are willing to see a new Siamese government that is democratic internally and open-minded externally, and we are willing to live in friendship with it and work for the peace of Southeast Asia and the economic revival of the Far East.</p>
<p>Sino-Thai relations are not only related to the future of Siam's economic development, but also to the survival and prosperity of 3.5 million overseas Chinese. Now that China and Siam have announced the restoration of diplomatic relations, we hope to resolve the issues of overseas Chinese migration to Siam, overseas Chinese operating rice industry, Siamese rice aiding China, and Sino-Thai trade through diplomatic channels in a peaceful and friendly manner, and we hope that the new Siamese government will change its course, with the maintenance of the rights and interests of overseas Chinese as its top priority, abolish the laws and regulations governing overseas Chinese, and grant overseas Chinese equal rights in law, politics, and economy. The "Bangkok Magazine" founded by Chinese people in Bangkok believes that Khuang's formation of a cabinet can open the key to Siam's diplomatic stalemate. The Chinese people, recalling the painful experiences of the past, have put forward the following demands, requiring the new Siamese government to express them in facts. (1) The "Private School Ordinance of Buddhist Era 2479," "The Second Amendment to the Private School Ordinance of Buddhist Era 2482," and "The Elementary Education Ordinance of Buddhist Era 2478" enacted by Phibunsongkhram in those years, which contain parts that violate the spirit of the Sino-Thai friendship treaty, should be explicitly abolished to remove the unfair situation of oppressed overseas Chinese education; (2) The emergency public security decree promulgated by Luang Phibunsongkhram in those years to expel overseas Chinese and the reserved occupation ordinance excluding overseas Chinese from employment should be explicitly abolished; (3) The "Immigration Restriction Ordinance" promulgated by the previous government is not in line with the spirit of friendship and should also be abolished; (4) Guarantee that there will be no resurrection of laws restricting overseas Chinese in the future. We sympathize with the demands of "Bangkok Magazine," value the voices of 3.5 million overseas Chinese, and hope that after the restoration of Sino-Thai relations, we will re-establish a good Sino-Thai relationship based on the spirit of the treaty and the opinions of overseas Chinese, and work together for the peace and prosperity of Southeast Asia.

<h3 id="e28">Washington Observers Believe that the United States Will Eventually Provide Military Aid to China <a href="#e28" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c28" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">28</a></h3>
<p>(Continued from page 1) Another less recognized factor is the enormous commercial interests that the United States now or will have in China, which secretly prompts Congress to tend toward proposals for large-scale aid to China. Even State Department officials who severely criticize the Chinese government's "corruption and inefficiency" are becoming increasingly concerned about how to reverse the failures of the Nationalist army on the battlefield in recent months.</p>
<p>According to these officials, when Marshall returned to the United States after his mediation of the Chinese civil war failed, US policy was somewhat of a spectator policy, believing that if the Nationalists and Communists fought for another six months, they would be exhausted and gain nothing, at which time it would be easier for the Nationalists and Communists to negotiate a coalition government; however, the facts of the past six months have proved that it was not as expected. Today, even the officials who criticize the Nationalists most severely are beginning to admit that the United States cannot stand by and watch the collapse of the Chinese government. However, the best-informed observers believe that if this aid can be passed, it must be passed after the aid to Europe plan is safely passed, so as not to eliminate the Marshall Plan by increasing aid to China. After Marshall admitted that the Communists' control of China north of the Yangtze River would threaten the US position in Korea and cause a "very serious problem" for the US occupying forces in Japan, US newspaper editorials continued to ask: If so, why doesn't the government provide military aid to the Chinese government?</p>
<p>Marshall's explanation that economic aid can save China some foreign exchange to purchase a small amount of military equipment does not seem to comfort those who fear the failure of the Chinese government.</p>
<p>Representatives of companies with a direct stake in Far Eastern economic interests, such as representatives of Mobil Oil, have been very concerned about the various congressional discussions on aid to China. They do not hide their hope that the United States will increase its aid to Chairman Chiang, so that China will have the hope of achieving peace and stability, which is a prerequisite for them to fully restore or expand their long-suspended commercial activities in China.</p>
<p>The best-informed observers believe that if it were not for Marshall's high personal prestige, the government would not have been able to ignore the various demands for increased military aid to China for so long. Even so, when Bridges, Taft, and other members who support military aid to China unanimously demand it with all their strength, the government will not be able to prevent Congress from passing the military aid to China bill.</p>
<p>In the midst of heated discussions on military aid to China, less attention seems to be paid to the question of whether the United States will help stabilize China's monetary system. Judd and Washington Post reporter Hsu, among others, have suggested that restoring a hard currency silver dollar system in China may be effective, but this has not attracted special attention from Congress or public opinion.</p>
<p>US officials are also very indifferent to China's hope that the United States will provide a one-time loan to help the Shanghai Foreign Exchange Stabilization Bureau prevent excessive fluctuations in the exchange rate of legal tender. Most officials seem to believe that this is just another loan on credit to China, and it will not be of any benefit to the foreign exchange situation or the monetary system.</p>

<p>[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 8th] Regarding the Japanese government's proposal to designate the Japanese patrol ship Chihaya to be responsible for preventing Japanese fishing boats from violating Chinese fishing rights again, our government has resolutely rejected it. According to personnel from our delegation to Japan, the Chinese government's attitude has been notified to the Japanese government by the Allied Headquarters, but no reply has been received so far. It is said that incidents of Japanese ships violating our country's fishing rights are endless. Our government has protested to the Allied Headquarters government more than once.

<h3 id="e32">Factories That Moved Inland During the War, the Petition Delegation Went to Beijing <a href="#e32" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c32" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">32</a></h3>
<p>Continuing to Call for Priority Compensation</p>
<p>[This city] Factories that moved inland during the war have repeatedly appealed to the government for priority in obtaining compensation machinery, but have not achieved results. Therefore, Xue Ming-jian, Chen Tian-he, and twelve others were specially selected to form a petition delegation, which went to Beijing last night, intending to continue to appeal to the relevant agencies. The delegation held a press conference at Guanshengyuan at 3:00 pm yesterday. Chen Tian-he reported on the purpose of the petition, saying that the purpose of going to Beijing to petition is to reiterate the position of the factories in the rear, and it is definitely not for personal interests, but purely for the future of the national industry. He hopes that the government will not forget the contributions of the factories that moved inland, which have long been following the government, to the country. In addition, he plans to report on their current situation and plans to contribute to the development of production by using compensated materials. The plan includes three major parts: (1) Manufacturing paper machines, (2) Manufacturing textile machines, (3) Manufacturing inland river ships. As long as the government provides the machines, we will raise funds ourselves, divide the work and cooperate, and the factories can be established. We hope that this trip will be successful, otherwise we can only resort to public opinion at home and abroad. Hu Yue-zhong said that the government should urgently support the outstanding members of the national industry. It is better to distribute the compensated machines early and promote production than to let them rust.</p>

A request for approval has been submitted to the provincial government. Furthermore, the rise in rice prices in Suzhou is becoming increasingly frantic.

<p>[Our Changsha Correspondent, 8th] Yu Feipeng stated in Changsha: The rise in grain prices is not entirely due to the procurement of military grain but is caused by the instability of domestic finance.

However, the various issues negotiated by the delegation here cannot be concretely decided. The delegation is scheduled to return to Hangzhou on the 10th.</p>

<h3 id="e55">Interim Measures for Simplifying Pre-Audit Procedures Announced and Implemented <a href="#e55" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c55" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">55</a></h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 8th] The pre-audit system has a feeling of difficulty in adapting to the current emergency affairs of mobilizing to suppress the rebellion. The National Government Committee previously resolved to temporarily authorize the Executive Yuan to handle matters expediently when difficulties arise. After the Executive Yuan and the Control Yuan jointly invited the Audit Department, the Directorate General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics, the Central Bank, and the Ministry of Finance to discuss, it was deemed that fundamental adjustments required amending the Audit Law, the Public Treasury Law, and other related laws and regulations, which would take a long time. It seemed possible to simplify the pre-audit procedures first to adapt to the situation. Therefore, Interim Measures for Simplifying Pre-Audit Procedures were drafted and submitted to the National Government for approval, announced by decree, and implemented immediately. The full text of the measures is as follows:</p>
<p>Article 1: Resident auditors in the public treasury shall cease issuing public treasury checks.</p>
<p>Article 2: Military and political expenses of military and political organs in the pacification areas, handled in accordance with the provisions of Item 3 of Article 2 of the "Temporary Emergency Military and Political Measures for Pacification Areas and the Three Northeastern Provinces," shall be notified to the auditing organs for record after reporting to the Executive Yuan for record.</p>
<p>Article 3: The construction projects and procurement of goods by military organs may be handled in accordance with the provisions of the "Interim Measures for Inspecting the Construction Projects and Procurement and Sale of Various Goods by Military Organs during the War of Resistance Against Japan," in accordance with the following measures. (1) Regarding military emergencies, bidding or mid-term increase or decrease in prices may be handled first with the approval of the competent authority, but the contract and related documents shall be sent to the auditing organ for verification. When the project is completed, the auditing organ shall be notified to supervise the acceptance. When the purchased goods arrive, the organizing authority shall be responsible for the acceptance, and the results of the acceptance shall be notified to the auditing organ. The auditing organ may send personnel to investigate or conduct random checks. (2) Regarding military secrets, they may be handled with the approval of the competent authority, but the handling process and acceptance results must be notified to the auditing organ at any time. The auditing organ may send personnel to investigate or conduct random checks.</p>
<p>Article 4: The construction projects and procurement of goods by public business organs shall be handled in accordance with the following measures. (1) Bidding for construction projects or mid-term increase or decrease in prices may be handled first with the approval of the competent authority. The contract and related documents shall be sent to the auditing organ for verification, and the auditing organ shall be notified to supervise the acceptance when the project is completed. (2) Bidding and acceptance for the procurement of goods may be handled with the approval of the competent authority, but the handling situation together with related documents shall be sent to the auditing organ for verification. The auditing organ may send personnel to investigate or conduct random checks.</p>
<p>Article 5: The inspection limits for central organs shall apply to the provisions of the "Measures for Inspecting the Construction Projects and Procurement and Sale of Goods by Gu Organs," and shall be increased or decreased at any time by the Audit Department according to the price index.</p>
<p>Article 6: The audit measures for military expenses shall be separately negotiated by the Audit Department and the military competent authority with reference to the "Implementation Plan of the New Budget and Financial System."</p>
<p>Article 7: These measures shall apply before the establishment of the political government and before the relevant audit laws are changed.</p>

<h3 id="e56">Brussels Conference Progresses Rapidly, West European Alliance Treaty Being Drafted, Five Countries Close on Economic Issues <a href="#e56" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c56" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">56</a></h3>
<p>[Reuters, Brussels, 8th] A spokesman for the British and Belgian delegations participating in the Five-Nation Western European Alliance Conference revealed that the five countries have reached an agreement on seven points in the draft of the West European Alliance Treaty and have handed it over to the drafting committee to draft the text based on the agreement. A Belgian spokesman said that this morning's meeting focused on economic issues, and the views of the countries are becoming closer. The aforementioned seven points do not all belong to economic issues, but include some statements of principle. The drafting committee includes British legal advisor Beckett, French representative Gross, Belgian representative Clasenbeer, Luxembourg representative Arm, and Dutch representative François. According to people close to the meeting, legal experts from various countries, based on Belgium's proposal, are studying how to request the International Court of Justice for arbitration when differences arise between the five countries. It is also known that opinions on overseas colonies have not yet been consistent. The UK and France advocate earnestly discussing the development of African and West Indian colonies at the meeting, while the Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg advocate that the foreign ministers of the five countries discuss it after the West European Alliance is established.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Brussels, 8th] The Brussels Charter, namely the West European Alliance Convention, is expected to quickly determine the final form when the representatives of the five countries reconvene on the 8th. Representatives who stayed in Brussels over the weekend and did not go elsewhere held informal private talks. Representatives from the Netherlands and Luxembourg returned to their respective countries over the weekend to consult their governments, and French External Secretary-General Xu Faner also returned to Paris to report to the government. British Ambassador Rentel also submitted a report to his home government. According to well-informed sources, the new proposal recently put forward by the UK and France contains a wider range than the original proposal, such as including the overseas territories of member states in the Western Alliance. This new proposal, brought by Xu Faner and British External Assistant Webb from London on Friday, will be the basis for the five-nation convention along with the memorandum of understanding from the Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg.</p>
<p>[United Press, Brussels, 7th] British diplomatic circles report that the 50-year agreement between the UK, France, the Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg will be signed on the evening of the 10th. The main future prospects of the recently drafted treaty will be economic. The treaty will eliminate all trade agreements between the five countries. Well-informed sources said that the political and military clauses in the treaty will be intentionally excluded, so that they can be concluded after detailed negotiations. The first negotiation will be the standardization of military equipment and training. This negotiation may begin when British Field Marshal Montgomery visits Belgium.</p>
<h3 id="e57">Finnish President Paasikivi Announces Willingness to Negotiate a Treaty with the Soviet Union, Suggests Moscow as the Negotiation Venue <a href="#e57" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c57" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">57</a></h3>
<p>[Our Report] London, 8th Broadcast: Helsinki News, Finnish President Paasikivi announced that the Finnish government has agreed to negotiate the suggestion made by Stalin, that the Soviet Union and Finland conclude a friendship and military treaty. He said that he has suggested that negotiations be held in Moscow. It is reported that most of the political parties in Finland do not approve of negotiating a military alliance. The reason for suggesting Moscow as the negotiation venue is that the Finnish government deeply fears that the Finnish Communist Party may cause trouble during the meeting.</p>
<p>[Our Report] London, 8th Broadcast: Helsinki News, a Finnish government official said that the Finnish cabinet decided today to begin negotiations with the Soviet Union. The Finnish side has suggested that negotiations be held in Moscow, but the list of delegates has not been announced. As for the nature of the negotiations, whether a military alliance and a friendship agreement are both within the scope of the negotiations, nothing has been revealed. The reason why the Finnish cabinet made this decision is that most of the six party groups in the Finnish Parliament approve of exchanging views with the Soviet side, because the suggestion was made by Stalin, which is related to the dignity of the Soviet Union; secondly, Finland also wants to understand the content of the Soviet suggestion in more detail.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Helsinki, 8th] President Paasikivi visited Finnish Marshal Mannerheim, a veteran, on Saturday to discuss the situation.</p>
<p>Finnish Opposition Party Rally, Communist Party Disrupts</p>
<p>[United Press, Helsinki, 7th] The Finnish Communist Party, for the first time, violently dispersed a rally of the Radical Socialist Party, which has very few members, on the 7th. Professor Hanturen, the 60-year-old leader of the Radical Party, was delivering a speech to a crowd of 5,000 people in the train station square, protesting against the signing of a treaty with the Soviet Union. The Communist Party drove away the crowd and walked onto the platform, attempting to beat him. The police responded to the call for help and arrested six thugs.</p>
<h3 id="e58">Slow Progress on the European Recovery Program, U.S. Government Quite Anxious <a href="#e58" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c58" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">58</a></h3>
<p>The European Situation is Becoming Increasingly Critical</p>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 8th] The slow progress of the Marshall European Recovery Program in Congress has made the government feel frustrated. This is especially true recently, with the Soviet Union intensifying its political and diplomatic offensive in Europe. Marshall made a moving appeal to several national leaders last week, requesting prompt action, and pointed out that the opportunity to aid Europe is rapidly being lost. The main factor that makes the U.S. government and congressional leaders feel the urgency of the situation is the Italian general election, which will be held on April 18. It is believed that if the Marshall Plan has not been approved and implemented by Congress by then, the Italian Communist Party will have more propaganda material in the election campaign, making it easier for them to overthrow the government and seize power. Another point that makes the U.S. government feel troubled is that even if Congress passes the Marshall Plan on April 1, the shipment of materials such as fuel and food to Europe will be no earlier than the summer. If Congress cannot pass the aid-Europe program on April 1, the situation in Europe will become more critical.</p>

<p>[Reuters, London, 7th] The International Committee of the European Unity Movement issued a declaration, urging European democratic countries to draft a declaration of human rights and consider effective measures to protect human rights. The committee passed a resolution after a three-day meeting, welcoming the Western European Alliance Conference in Beijing and strongly advocating the organization of intergovernmental committees in Europe to take effective emergency measures required by the current political and economic situation. The units participating in the International Committee of the European Unity Movement include the United Europe Movement led by Churchill, the European Economic Cooperation Independent League led by former Belgian Prime Minister Van Zeeland, the French Committee for European Unity led by French National Assembly Speaker Herriot, and the European Federal Movement led by Burgman. The conference will hold a European Unity Congress in The Hague in May. The British Labour Party has refused to participate.</p>

<p>[Reuters, Chenggong Lake, 8th] Representatives from the United States, China, France, and the Soviet Union are scheduled to meet on the 8th at the Park Avenue office of the Soviet Union's chief representative to the United Nations, Gromyko, to discuss the Palestinian issue. The United Kingdom does not intend to participate in the discussion but will send a representative for consultation. The major issues facing the four powers include: (1) Whether they should report to the Security Council that there have been acts of violence in Palestine that disrupt peace and require international armed action; (2) Whether the Palestinian Committee can begin to organize national militias and gather weapons for their use; (3) If the powers believe that an international force is needed to support the United Nations Committee, how should the international force be organized; (4) Whether the Security Council can agree to recognize the Palestinian Committee as the legitimate government of Palestine, pending the theoretical acquisition of full sovereignty by both Jewish and Arab states on October 1st.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Jerusalem, 8th, United Press] An unconfirmed report broadcast by a Jewish underground organization claims that the new partition plan proposed by the United Kingdom involves incorporating the Arab areas of Palestine into Lebanon, Syria, Transjordan, and Egypt, respectively. British officials have vehemently denied this plan.</p>
<h3 id="e62">De Gaulle Appeals to the US for Military Aid to Western Europe; Delivers Speech Hoping to Regain Power <a href="#e62" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c62" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">62</a></h3>
<p>[Reuters, Paris, 7th] General de Gaulle delivered a speech today in Compiègne (fifty miles northeast of Paris), the site where the armistice agreements of the two World Wars were signed, announcing that he has completed all preparations to assume the responsibility of leading the country. De Gaulle has effectively changed the entire political situation in France, and political figures predict that de Gaulle is expected to regain power within the next six weeks. De Gaulle's direct request for the French government to be handed back to him and his followers is the first time since he resigned as Prime Minister in 1946.</p>
<p>De Gaulle's speech today stated that France is feeling threatened by a certain empire abroad that aims to dominate the world, and is also being disrupted domestically by those who are willing to serve these foreigners. If our country does not take decisive measures, it cannot put its affairs in order. The free countries of Europe must establish an economic, diplomatic, and military bloc, uniting their production, trade, diplomacy, and defense. Only a bloc with 250 million people can maintain its survival. France should be the center of this bloc, extending from the North Sea to the Mediterranean Sea and east to the Rhine River. This bloc should include both Germany and Austria. We also believe that Europe and America must unite their forces to allow the entire world to be reborn. This means that the United States must provide substantial economic aid to Europe. The United States has already taken this initiative, which is both generous and far-sighted. In addition to economic aid, the United States must also accurately and clearly support Europe in terms of defense. The Soviet Union is trying to dominate the world. The Soviet Union has vast manpower and resources, and its people are obedient. Its 180 million people are under absolute dictatorial rule. The Soviet Union is using its trump card, and its neighboring countries, Finland, Austria, Greece, Turkey, and Iran, are feeling uneasy. Italy is in a state of fear, and the towns and cities of France are also feeling significant unease. In domestic affairs, De Gaulle believes that the parliamentary system has shown its fragility. He also said that, as far as he is concerned, he has completed all preparations so that when the environment allows him to assume the necessary responsibility, he will lead the country towards the path of self-salvation and greatness. His domestic policy advocates reducing government spending, striving to increase production, and advocating that trade unions should eliminate political colors. De Gaulle has begun to engage with leaders of all parties in the parliament except the Communist Party to prepare for the dissolution of the parliament and the holding of new elections.</p>

<p>[United Press, Washington, 8th] A plan to reorganize the US State Department is currently under study. According to those familiar with its content, the main purpose of the reorganization is to accelerate the work of various departments. However, whether it will be implemented will be decided by Secretary of State Marshall and President Truman. It is reported that routine diplomatic affairs will be presided over by the Under Secretary of State. US relations with Europe, Latin America, the Far East, the Middle East, and Africa will be his respective responsibilities. In addition, three or four Under Secretaries of State will be added to oversee domestic and foreign public relations, economic and United Nations affairs, and possibly the administration of occupied areas in Germany and Japan. This distribution of responsibilities will be fundamentally different from the current system. For example, political relations between the United States and other countries are currently presided over by Under Secretary of State Armour, economic relations by Thorp, and public relations by Allen. The vacancy for Under Secretary of Economic Affairs left by Marshall will no longer be filled in the future. Instead, a new position of Under Secretary of Administration will be established.</p>

<p>[United Press, Berlin, 7th] According to the most reliable sources here today, the Soviet Union is rebuilding the former German naval shipyard in Wilhelmshaven on the White Sea as an important base for developing the Arctic route. The chosen location is Molotovsk. The Wilhelmshaven shipyard was originally the main German base in the North Sea. In fact, the entire shipyard is being treated as reparations to the Soviet Union. Its machinery, electrical equipment, torpedoes, metal plates, smelting furnaces, and other factory equipment are being dismantled. Observers here are very interested in the Soviet Union's development of its Arctic route and its efforts to open a waterway between the Baltic Sea and the Black Sea, while establishing its naval position in the Baltic Sea. Pillau in the Gulf of Danzig has become the main base for the Soviet Baltic Southern Fleet. Soviet warships can load fuel and food here, and have the repair and construction facilities of the port of Königsberg as their support.</p>

<p>[Reuters, London, 9th] The British government today released a report reviewing the current state of the national economy, and also released the economic plan for 1948. It attaches great importance to aid under the Marshall Plan, believing that Britain must use this aid to strengthen Britain's working capacity and effectiveness, and develop the supply resources of the country and the sterling area. The report states that Britain has a dual plan for foreign recovery: one is to achieve a balance of international payments, and the other is to find a satisfactory way to pay for the prices of goods from the Western Hemisphere as soon as possible. Measures to implement this plan include (1) increasing the export rate, especially the export rate to the Western Hemisphere; (2) developing the supply resources of the British Commonwealth, especially the British colonies; (3) requesting countries in the sterling area to economize on the use of US dollars; (4) finally restoring multilateral trade and currency acceptance.</p>

<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 8th, United Press] The former leader of the Bulgarian Agrarian Party, Dimitrov, said that the Soviet Union is now attempting to control all of Europe in preparation for a final war with the United States. He said that part of this prediction is based on reports secretly transmitted from Soviet satellite countries in Eastern Europe. These reports indicate that the Soviet Union's next target is Italy, not Finland. The Communist Party will not rush to do anything in Finland because they are preparing to target Italy and make divisive efforts. What is even more dangerous is that the events taking place in Italy will be related to similar actions in France, Germany, and Austria, which means all of Europe.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Rome, 7th] The recent political developments in Czechoslovakia have aroused considerable sensitivity among Italians, but political observers cannot give a definite answer to the question of whether Italy will closely follow in Czechoslovakia's footsteps. The Italian general election is scheduled for April 18th, and the Communist Party's propaganda is quite effective in hitting the people's psychology. The issue that Italians are most concerned about at present is the colonial issue. The Communist Party is using the Soviet Union's reiteration that Italy should be placed in trusteeship over its former territories as a source of information to win the sympathy of the public. At the same time, the Italian Communist Party is also fiercely attacking the United States. The recent reduction in the number of strike movements in Italy may also be a means for the Italian Communist Party to win the favor of the public.</p>

<p>[United Press, Washington, 7th] A subcommittee of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, led by Republican Representative Mrs. Bolton, studied the communist problem for a year and submitted a report yesterday, believing that the Communist Party believes that world revolution is imminent. It is said that the Communist Party's only goal is world revolution. Those people speculate that this revolution will come fiercely. Communist and non-communist politicians currently expect major changes to occur in Europe in the shortest possible time. In addition to the advent of any economic crisis, the Communist Party believes that the whole world is even in a political crisis. Those people believe that major regions of the world are now approaching revolution. The Communist Party hopes for the following changes: (1) the collapse of capitalism, which will come with the US recession; (2) this situation will spread rapidly to the whole world; (3) revolutions will break out; (4) the Soviet Union and the Communist Party want to encourage struggle, but try their best to stay out of it; (5) if they hope to wait and see, they will take advantage of the situation when the time is right and accept the broken world. The report is divided into three volumes. The upper volume is a general discussion, the middle volume is the statements of Soviet and Communist figures over the past century, and the lower volume is a variety of protests recently made by the United States against the words and deeds of the Soviet Union.</p>

<p>[Agence France-Presse, London, 7th] The Bulgarian Ambassador to the UK, Professor Todorov, told reporters today that the recent incidents in Eastern Europe, Central Europe, and Czechoslovakia made it impossible for him to work in London again, so he had no choice but to resign. However, his resignation was purely voluntary. Todorov once served as the vice-chancellor of the University of Sofia and defended the leader of the Bulgarian opposition party, Petkov, during his trial in September last year.</p>

<p>[United Press, Paris, 8th] When the French National Assembly met at 10:00 am on the 8th to discuss the last and most controversial clause of the Schuman forced loan bill, Schuman's position seemed extremely firm. According to reliable sources, the French Communist Party plans to hold a demonstration in the Tuileries Garden this afternoon to protest against the forced loan bill. In the parliament's two-day debate on financial measures, the government repeatedly won, which can prevent Schuman from resigning. Many observers said that De Gaulle's relatively mild speech a few days ago actually strengthened Schuman's position.</p>

<p>Wallace's Third Party Named Progressive Party</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 7th] The US Republican presidential campaign will have a major development at this week's primary in New Hampshire. Following this, there will be two more heated events: one is the Wisconsin primary on April 6th, and the other is the Nebraska primary on April 13th. The combined results of these primary meetings will, to some extent, obtain a trial decision on whether the Republican nominee for president this year is popular. The primary in New Hampshire is mainly a competition between New York Governor Dewey and Minnesota Governor Stassen. Political observers predict that Dewey will have a slight advantage. Dewey and Stassen will also face MacArthur in the Wisconsin primary for 27 national convention delegates.</p>
<p>[United Press, York, Pennsylvania, 7th] Wallace told a conference of 2,000 people at the first campaign convention of the Pennsylvania Progressive Party today: "The Truman Doctrine wants to provide military and economic assistance to various countries to resist communism. These people and their plans will never change because of the change of executors." The conference passed a resolution formally naming the third party led by Wallace the "Progressive Party."</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, New York, 8th] Wallace gave a speech at an electoral assembly here on the 8th, saying that those who accuse us of being red communists and Soviet agents do not really fear communism, but they actually fear democracy. They are afraid of the anger of the people when wages are reduced, when savings are lost, and when anxiety increases. This is the result of their public discussion of the evil policy of war and is enough to waste our country's property.</p>

<h3 id="e73">Japan's New Cabinet to be Established Soon; Socialist Party to Occupy the Largest Number of Cabinet Seats; All Parties Predict the New Cabinet Will Probably Die Young <a href="#e73" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c73" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">73</a></h3>
<p>[United Press, Tokyo, 8th] Japanese observers said: Ashida may complete the cabinet formation work late on the 8th. It has been seventeen days since Ashida was elected as the new Prime Minister of Japan. At 5 pm on the 8th, Ashida decided to concurrently serve as the Minister of Foreign Affairs. The distribution of cabinet members in the new cabinet will generally be: members of the Socialist Party, 7 from the Democratic Party, and 2 from the Cooperative Party.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 8th] The major problems of the formation of the Ashida cabinet have been resolved as of this afternoon, but the list of cabinet members has not yet been announced. The general public believes that this news may be short-lived. Political observers believe that the policies of the future cabinet will not be different from those of the Katayama cabinet. There will be more members of the Social Democratic Party than members of the Democratic Party in Ashida's cabinet. Ashida allowed the Social Democratic Party to choose first from among the 19 cabinet positions, and the Democratic Party only disputed the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry.</p>
<p>[New Asia News Agency, Tokyo, 8th] Shidehara Kijuro made a speech in Kiryu City on the 7th on the current political situation, saying: "Regardless of whether Katayama joins the cabinet or not, the Ashida cabinet is a short-lived cabinet because the left wing of the Socialist Party will adopt the same attitude as it did in the Katayama cabinet. In the case of non-cooperation from the left wing, Ashida's cabinet will not be able to occupy a majority of the seats in the parliament, so the life of the new cabinet may not exceed three months."</p>
<p>[United Press, Tokyo, 8th] Japanese observers said on the 8th: Prime Minister Ashida is still facing difficulties in forming a cabinet, because the three parties that support Ashida have already begun to manipulate the "selection" of cabinet members' seats. It seems that the current Japanese cabinet cannot be completed before the 10th. At the same time, former Prime Minister Katayama said in his speech that even if Ashida can form a cabinet, its life will not exceed three months. His predecessor, Prime Minister Yoshida, is now leading a new party movement organized by conservatives.</p>

<h3 id="e77">Military Meeting Resolves Preventive Measures; Restricts the Migration of Eligible Young Men; Those with Legitimate Reasons Should Seek Guarantors to Apply; New Recruit Settlement Fees Should Be Allocated by the City Government <a href="#e77" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c77" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">77</a></h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] The city's first conscription of 6,000 people this year is about to begin. The Military Service Association held its fourth meeting at the association at 2:00 pm yesterday. More than 20 people including Du Yuesheng and Zhang Xingbai attended. Chen Tianqiao, commander of the Shanghai Garrison District, Zhang Xiaosong, director of the Civil Affairs Bureau, and Yao Wenying, section chief, were also present. Chairman Pan Gongzhan reported on the decisions made at the military service meeting on the 29th of last month, and the city council passed the conscription method in the city this year, which combines lottery and voluntary service. Later, Commander Chen, Director Zhang, Tan Yimin, and others made reports on their respective areas of responsibility. Director Zhang particularly pointed out that in Huangpu District, more than 200 eligible young men applied to move out in one day the day before yesterday. Other districts also report daily requests to move out in order to evade military service, urging to find ways to stop it. Subsequently, proposals were discussed and the following resolutions were passed: (1) Regarding the control of young men in the city, please order each district to temporarily suspend the application for moving out for eligible young men aged 21 to 25 during the conscription processing period. If there is a legitimate reason to apply for moving out, in order to prevent evasion of military service, a solid guarantor must be found in the city. If selected in the future, they must still serve. (2) Regarding the planning and development of the settlement fee for new recruits, please allocate 5% of the revenue from public utilities and banquet donations and entertainment donations in the city for this purpose. (3) The conscription fee for new recruits is 10,000 yuan per soldier allocated by the central government this year, which is not enough. It was decided to subsidize 100,000 yuan per soldier in the suburbs (Wusong, Gaoqiao, Jiangwan, Dachang, Xinjing, Longhua, Sisheng, and Yangjing) and 60,000 yuan per soldier in the urban area. This subsidy expense will be paid from the preferential treatment fund. (4) Those who applied for exemption from conscription in the 36th year and have been approved but have not paid the preferential treatment fee should continue to be urged to pay it. (5) Preferential treatment fees for conscripted young men in the 36th year will be collected continuously by formulating other measures. Last year, the preferential treatment fee for households without conscripted young men only received 1,645,980,000 yuan, and there are still many outstanding payments, which should be cleared within a limited time. Whether this preferential treatment fee will be collected this year will be reserved for later decision. (6) The advance payment of 12 billion yuan for the settlement subsidy for new recruits in the 36th year has no funds to return. It was decided to collect 90,000 yuan per exemption certificate to offset part of it and to recognize it retroactively. (7) The budget for the Propaganda Committee is 380 million yuan. (8) New recruits' consolation gifts will be handled by the Military Service Association at its discretion depending on the financial situation. (9) Other new recruits' consolation matters will be handled by the Military Service Association in a unified manner. (10) Revised draft of the organizational rules and procedures of various standing committees of the Military Service Association. At the end, two temporary proposals were also passed: (1) The lottery committee of the Military Service Association will be established on the 15th of this month. The date of the lottery will be decided after the committee is established. (2) The physical examination for new recruits will be held regularly according to the examination methods in the 36th year.</p>
<p>[Also reported] The Civil Affairs Bureau is scheduled to convene a symposium this afternoon to convene conference district security team leaders to formulate implementation measures for military service conscription and solicit their opinions on the actual situation of each district security team.</p>

<p>[Our Report] Wu Yuxin was accused of hoarding for speculation, and the District Prosecutor's Office has filed a public prosecution yesterday.

The Social Bureau sent personnel to investigate and transfer the case to the police station, and then to the District Prosecutor's Office for investigation. It was believed that the defendant hoarded oil for profit during the period of suppression of the rebellion, which not only affected the people's food but also contributed to the rise in prices, violating Article 18, Paragraph 1 of the Measures for Cracking Down on Hoarding and Speculation of Important Daily Necessities During the Extraordinary Period. According to Article 31 of the Agricultural, Mining, Industrial, and Commercial Management Regulations During the Extraordinary Period, he should be severely punished, and a public prosecution was filed in accordance with Article 230, Paragraph 1 of the Criminal Procedure Law.</p>

<h3 id="e89">Urban Planning Committee Explains Four Points Regarding the Issue of Factories Moving Out of Non-Factory Areas <a href="#e89" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c89" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">89</a></h3>
<p>[Our Report] The Urban Planning Committee recently delineated the built-up area of the city and stipulated that all factories in non-factory areas should be moved out. The plan has been approved in principle by the Senate and submitted to the Executive Yuan for approval and implementation. In order to clarify the situation to the outside world, the committee explained the following four points: (1) Most of the very dangerous factories that should be moved are due to simple equipment, and the loss of moving is not large. (2) There are many well-equipped factories in the designated factory areas, and the government does not force them to move to remote designated factory areas. (3) Factories that should be banned in the future should be determined based on their degree of danger. (4) Small factories mixed with residential households in the same neighborhood often cause disputes. If there are intentional accusations, good factories will be protected after the detailed rules for factory management and ban are passed.</p>
<h3 id="e90">Mayor Convenes Relevant Agencies to Review Rice Distribution Work, Welcomes Criticism and Reporting of Corruption, Extends the Deadline for Purchasing Rice with Certificates, 500,000 Dan of Rice Distributed This Month, Divided into Three Categories <a href="#e90" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c90" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">90</a></h3>
<p>[Our Report] Yesterday afternoon, Mayor Wu convened Ren Xianqun, chairman of the Civil Food Allocation Committee, Liu Xingji, director of the Control Department of the Ministry of Food, Ye Shifu, counselor, and representatives from the Executive Yuan's Committee for Handling US Relief Materials and the China Relief Corps to jointly review the progress of rice distribution. Afterwards, a press conference was held in the city government auditorium. Mayor Wu first reported that after the full implementation of rice distribution, the price of rice in the city still increased. In addition to telegraphing the Ministry of Food to suppress prices in producing areas, efforts were also made to promote the efficiency of the rice distribution system. All sectors are welcome to criticize the rice distribution work and report corruption. Since the start of rice distribution, 100,000 dan of rice have been distributed as of yesterday, enough for one million people to purchase. There are still 400,000 dan of rice left, which can be delivered in succession before the 20th of this month. In addition, the deadline for purchasing rice with the rice distribution certificates for the first half of this month, originally scheduled to end on the 12th, is now extended to the 27th.</p>
<p>Rice Distribution Certificates for Foreigners Handled by the Police Bureau</p>
<p>Ren, the chairman, then reported: (1) Starting from April, the rice distribution certificates will be changed to one issue per month, regardless of the first or second half of the month. According to current estimates, the purchase of rice will not be crowded. As of the 5th of this month, 2,475,000 rice distribution certificates have been issued for the first half of this month, and the rice distribution certificates for the second half of this month will be issued before the 10th. (2) Because the household registration of foreigners is handled by the police bureau, the rice distribution certificates will also be issued by the police bureau and can be completed between the 11th and 15th. (3) All citizens who reported their household registration before the 10th of this month can receive a rice distribution certificate; otherwise, they can file a complaint. (4) The city has 5 million residents who need 500,000 dan of rice per month based on one dou per person. There are 1,950 rice shops in the city, and 892 of them are implementing rice distribution. In order to speed up the rice distribution work, the CITIC Bureau warehouses have been asked to continue working as usual on weekend evenings, opening eight warehouses every day and releasing 32,000 dan of rice. (5) Since the distribution of rice six days ago, 60% of the rice payments have been received. This is because there are not enough staff in the Bank of China and the Postal Remittance Bureau, which collect the payments. After the two places strengthened their work, 80% has been received yesterday, and it is expected to be fully collected today. (6) In terms of rice quality, the rice distributed this month is self-raised by the government. Among them, 250,000 dan is Siam rice No. 1, 150,000 dan is Burmese rice, and 100,000 dan is purchased by the Ministry of Food in the Yangtze River basin. The color of the rice may be worse, but they are all similar to medium-cooked rice. The public should not misunderstand. Starting in April, all of them will be US rice. The Civil Food Allocation Committee will also establish a unified news agency to announce the quality of rice distribution in each district every month.</p>
<p>Chairman Ren is Optimistic about the Future of Rice Prices</p>
<p>Chairman Ren is quite optimistic about the future of rice prices in the city. He said that rice distribution accounts for two-thirds of the total demand in the city's rice market and has the power to control rice prices. Although the free market rice price has recently risen, it is accidental and he believes that it will definitely fall back in the future.</p>

<p>[Our Report] Factories that moved inland during the war have formed a petition group to fight for compensation for Japanese machinery. They left for Nanjing on the night train last night to petition. They held a press conference before departure. Chen Tianhe of Huaimin Experimental Factory reported at the press conference that the purpose of the petition is to reiterate to the government the position of inland factories to fight for Japanese compensation materials, and not for personal interests. The inland factories made great contributions during the war, and now the final victory has finally been achieved, but the factories are still willing to continue to serve the country and intend to contribute to the government's plan to increase production by using compensation materials. Because the compensation machines are the mother machines for manufacturing machines, the plan is to form three groups of factories: (1) manufacturing papermaking machines, (2) manufacturing textile machines, and (3) manufacturing inland river ships. Finally, he said that this petition must get a concrete answer. If the authorities cannot answer immediately, they are willing to wait in Nanjing for a long time.</p>
<h3 id="e97">Important Resolutions of the Industrial Association: Request to Increase Allocation of Material Objects to Solve the Factory Crisis, Wages for This Month Calculated According to the Index of Last Month <a href="#e97" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c97" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">97</a></h3>
<p>[Our Report] The Municipal Industrial Association held its 18th joint meeting of directors and supervisors yesterday afternoon at 6 pm. All directors and supervisors, more than 20 people, attended. The meeting was chaired by Wu Yunshuxu, and four important proposals were resolved: (1) Regarding how to solve the problem of factories being unable to bear the increasing cost of living index, it was resolved: to petition the government to increase the types and quantities of material object allocations, and reduce the allocation prices, so as to avoid the rise in the index. (2) It should be recommended that the government suspend the implementation of the regulation that legal persons must also assess and pay special rescue donations. (3) To request the government to rigidly stipulate that the wages for this month should be calculated according to the cost of living index of last month, so as to calculate the cost. (4) The current method of laying off workers in this city affects factory administration. It is requested that the government strictly abide by the Factory Law and the regulations promulgated by the Ministry of Social Affairs regarding the employment and dismissal of workers. If a labor dispute occurs due to the reasonable dismissal of workers, the factory should have the right to dismiss all workers and register and employ new workers.</p>
<h3 id="e98">Employees of Four Banks and Two Bureaus Accept Guidance from the Authorities, Extension of Work Action Not Realized <a href="#e98" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c98" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">98</a></h3>
<p>[Our Report] The employees of the four banks and two bureaus made three requests to the authorities, hoping to improve their treatment. The "Friendship Association of Employees of Four Banks and Two Bureaus," which was in charge of this request to improve treatment, issued leaflets yesterday morning, deciding to automatically extend their work by four hours after get off work yesterday afternoon, until 9 pm, to wait for the authorities' response. The heads of the banks and bureaus immediately went to persuade them after hearing the news. The Municipal Police Bureau also sent police officers to the banks and bureaus to maintain order. At about 6 pm, the employees of the banks and bureaus accepted the persuasion and left voluntarily. This unprecedented "extension of work" was not realized.</p>
<p>The Ministry of Finance Sends a Telegram Urging Earnest Persuasion</p>
<p>After learning of this dispute, the Ministry of Finance sent a special telegram to the national banks and bureaus yesterday, urging them to earnestly enlighten them. The telegram stated: "The treatment of employees of national banks and bureaus has always been better than that of general public and education personnel. Recently, the government adjusted treatment and resolved that the salaries of personnel in state-owned enterprises should be strictly handled in accordance with the regulations on the calculation of salaries for personnel in state-owned enterprises. This resolution has not yet been reported to the banks and bureaus. Some employees, in addition to the current various extra preferential treatments, have asked for increased treatment, which is not appropriate. I hereby telegraph to instruct the heads of the relevant banks and bureaus to earnestly enlighten and be responsible for guiding them. If there is any transgression, they should be severely punished immediately in order to correct discipline."</p>
<p>Jointly Publish a Letter to Colleagues</p>
<p>The four banks and the CITIC Bureau also jointly issued a "Letter to Colleagues," stating: "This time, the government originally stipulated that the treatment of personnel in state-owned enterprises should not exceed 30% of the treatment of public and education personnel. In order to take care of the lives of colleagues, the banks and bureaus have repeatedly negotiated with the authorities. In addition to maintaining the original treatment, the living allowance will also be calculated according to the index of public and education personnel. The original meal expenses in the public kitchen have also been repeatedly requested and only reluctantly retained, but the differential must be cancelled. This is a government regulation, and the banks and bureaus cannot change it." It also said that recently some people have been distributing leaflets and posting slogans in the name of colleagues in the banks and bureaus, agitating the situation. The Municipal Security Bureau is paying close attention to this action because finance is the lifeblood of the social economy. It also stated that during the period of suppressing the rebellion, disturbing finance and hindering security are clearly stated in the law. All acts that are close to coercion or interfere with the freedom of others not only violate the discipline of the banks and bureaus, but also will not be allowed by the security authorities. I hope colleagues will not test the law.</p>
<h3 id="e99">Serious Famine in Chaoshan, Appealing for Support from All Walks of Life, Zhang Shengtong and Others Report on the Process <a href="#e99" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c99" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">99</a></h3>
<p>[Our Report] Zhang Shengtong, a senator from Shantou City, and Ding Guoqiu, a major general counselor from the Quzhou Pacification Commissioner's Office, have recently been dealing with the extremely serious famine in Chaoshan. They went to Nanjing to meet Minister Yu of the Ministry of Food and agreed to purchase food in Taiwan, Hankou, Wuhu, southern Fujian and other places to supplement it. Yesterday, they specially hosted leaders of Chaoshan descent in Shanghai and the press at the Dadong Restaurant. Zhang and others immediately reported on the Chaoshan famine and the efforts made to appeal in various places, hoping that people from all walks of life would sympathize and support them.</p>
<p>Frequent Disasters, Widespread Suffering</p>
<p>According to reports: The eleven counties and cities in the fifth district of Guangdong, Chaoshan, are all located with mountains on their backs and facing the sea, with very little grain production. Before the Anti-Japanese War, they relied on the import of about 4 million dan of foreign rice every year. However, the local population (excluding those going to the South Seas Islands) is about 4,420,000, and the annual grain requirement is about 20 million dan, which is less than half of the annual grain production of only about 10 million dan. Now, foreign rice from Siam and Vietnam is prohibited from opening, and various domestic rice-producing areas have successively restricted the export of grain, and the supply of foreign rice has been interrupted invisibly. In addition, there was a drought in 1946, a flood at the beginning of 1947, and then a typhoon in the late harvest, resulting in a serious disaster and widespread suffering. Now, even more so at a time when the old grain has been exhausted and the new grain has not yet ripened, the shortage of grain is becoming increasingly serious. Fortunately, the Chaoshan Grain Adjustment Committee was established on January 13th of this year. As a result of running around and appealing, President Song of Guangdong Province first allocated 20 billion yuan as the committee's fund. On the one hand, Zhang Shengtong and others were sent to Taiwan, Fujian, and other places to purchase rice to alleviate the emergency, and it is hoped that people from all walks of life will show sympathy and support.</p>
<h3 id="e100">Commemorating Women's Day, Celebration at the Majestic Theatre, Awarding Certificates for Essays and Speeches <a href="#e100" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c100" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">100</a></h3>
<p>[Our Report] Yesterday was "March 8" International Women's Day. Women from all walks of life in the city held a celebration at the Majestic Theatre yesterday morning at 9 am. More than 1,000 people from various women's organizations and female students attended. The presidium was composed of Tang Guanyu, Jin Zhenyu, Huang Zhuoqun, Ling Weicheng, Mrs. Yu Shuping, Mrs. Zhao, Mrs. Zhang Xiangwen, Ling Qishen, Zhang Hongwei, Lu Huimin, Lu Lihua, Ling Yingzhen, Chen Hailun, Chen Shaoqing, Xie Yonghua, Fang Yingda, Zhou Jinping, and others. After the ceremony, the whole assembly sang the national anthem and the March 8 Women's Day song. Jin Zhen, the chairman, gave a speech stating that International Women's Day not only has a glorious value in human history, but also fully demonstrates the significance of the national father realizing world harmony. The reason why the permanent peace of mankind has not yet had a solid foundation is that political power is in the hands of men. I hope that female compatriots will reflect on themselves while commemorating International Women's Day, and hope to unite the power of the female world to seek happiness for mankind!</p>
<p>Then Huang Zhuoqun gave a speech stating that "March 8" has profound meaning for our country. The word "three" can represent Dr. Sun Yat-sen's Three Principles of the People: Nationalism represents freedom, Livelihoodism represents mutual assistance, and Democracy represents equality. The word "eight" can represent the eight virtues of China, namely loyalty, filial piety, benevolence, love, faith, righteousness, peace, and harmony. Next year will be the 38th year of the Republic of China, and next year's Women's Day will be a "double March 8" commemoration. I hope that everyone will work hard to make the emancipation of women a success.</p>
<p>Then Ms. Tang Guanyu said in her speech that this year's "March 8" Women's Day is more glorious than last year because the constitution has confirmed that women have the right to participate in politics. In order to progress and emancipate, women hope to participate in social activities and production undertakings as much as possible while taking care of family life.</p>
<p>The congress then passed a resolution to pay tribute to President Chiang and his wife, and to pay tribute to the soldiers at the front. It also put forward a temporary motion to send a telegram to Zhang Dulun, the mayor of Chongqing, asking him to respect women's rights and protect women's occupations.</p>
<p>List of Winners of Competitions</p>
<p>Finally, Ms. Huang Zhuoqun presented awards to the winners of the essay contest, speech contest, and basketball game. The list of winners is as follows: Speech Contest Awards (copper photos seen on the sixth page), first place in the senior group: Lu Lanying from Kunfan Girls' High School, second place: Miao Liqun from Nanyang Girls' High School, third place: Yang Shaoguang from Daode High School, fourth place: Sun Na from Minguo Girls' High School, fifth place: Lv Lixin from Shanghai Girls' High School.

First place in the university group: Liu Haizhen from Fudan University, second place: Zhou Shushen from Fudan University, third place: Yang Shoubai from Yubei Xianghui College. After the meeting, the movie "God-daughter" was shown.</p>
<p>At 2 pm, the female workers held an entertainment party at the Municipal Gymnasium on Avenue Albert. The performances were very exciting. In the evening, women leaders held a symposium on women's issues at the Dalai Hotel on Jing'an Temple Road, and had a dinner party, which ended happily at about 8 pm.</p>

<p>[Our Report] Yesterday was "March 8" Women's Day, and thousands of dancers in the city spent this holiday in silence. The dancers in the dance halls that are about to close at the end of March are preparing to transfer back to the dance halls that have not yet closed. Most of the dancers still seem to have not decided on their final destination, and they still think that the business will be more prosperous during the period of dance hall merger and acquisition in the future. However, Jin Meihong and Sun Zhimin, who once served as dancers' representatives, have torn up their dancer licenses and entered cram schools to study, indicating that they are unwilling to continue their hugging career. Yesterday, the dance hall industry also collected millions of yuan to purchase food and send it to the detained dancers and employees.</p>

If anyone dares to violate this, once discovered, they will be severely punished.</p>
<h3 id="e105">Shanghai Prison: Three Inmates Cause Trouble; Staff Member Assaulted and Injured; Warden Requests Investigation <a href="#e105" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c105" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">105</a></h3>
<p>[Report from this Newspaper] Yesterday, the Shanghai Prison sent a letter to the District Prosecutor's Office stating that three inmates had assaulted prison staff and requesting an investigation and legal action. The incident occurred when staff member Wang Qi had just entered the prison gate at 10:00 AM on the fourth of this month and saw several sick inmates lining up to go to the hospital. Among them was inmate Yang Baorong (also known as Yang Honggen), number 1058, who had previously been punished for violating regulations and suspended from work. He questioned Wang about when he could resume working. Before Wang could answer, Yang smeared the feces he had hidden in his hand on Wang's face. At the same time, inmate Xu Jiansheng, number 652, and inmate Lin Mingxin, number 3478, rushed forward and knocked Wang to the ground, smearing him with the feces they had hidden, and punching and kicking him, causing Wang's eyes and nose to bleed, his legs to be injured, and his glasses to be broken. Fortunately, guard Song Mingjian and inmate Liu Yucai, number 2485, bravely intervened. When the guards arrived, the situation was brought under control. Wang then went to the prison hospital for examination and filled out an injury report, which was reported to Warden Kong. The Shanghai Prison, considering the three inmates to have obstructed official duties and caused injury, sent a letter to the District Prosecutor's Office yesterday requesting an investigation in accordance with the law. It is noted that the two inmates are both robbers. Yang was originally sentenced to ten years by the District Court, which was reduced to five years after an amnesty. Xu was originally sentenced to eight years by the Garrison Headquarters, which was reduced to four years after an amnesty. Lin Mingxin was sentenced to seven years and six months by the Shanghai High Court. All three had previously caused trouble in prison and were placed in solitary confinement, which was lifted on January 30 of this year.</p>

<h3 id="e117">Shanxi Travelogue (4) - The Pillar of Suppression <a href="#e117" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c117" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">117</a></h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper, Taiyuan, 2nd by Airmail] The Northwest Industrial Construction Company has been the largest material pillar of Shanxi's political, economic, and defense construction for the past fourteen years. In the past, it laid the foundation for Shanxi's light and heavy industries with its abundant underground resources. Today, it has transformed into a supply department for the suppression of bandits. Cement and steel for building bunkers, rails and trains for transportation, fabrics, fuel, and electricity for people's livelihood - if one or two of these supplies were in short supply, the 17 counties and one city in central Shanxi would definitely not be able to maintain the rock-solid stability they have today.</p>
<p>Thirty-Six Factories</p>
<p>Organizationally, the Northwest Company is one of the largest private enterprises in Shanxi Province. However, due to the obstruction of Shanxi's external transportation, the government now centrally controls the purchase of raw materials and the sale of finished products from the factories. The accounting between the government and private sectors cannot be sorted out for the time being.</p>
<p>Including 52 heavy industrial units such as wool weaving, leather, cement, electrochemistry, locomotives, steel smelting, papermaking, and power generation, only 36 units were left after the eight-year War of Resistance. No one expected that while recovering from the damage and striving for revival, they would have to resist the rampant bandits. Under the slogan "Factories are Fortresses," entering each factory, one would see chimneys spewing black smoke behind the telegraph poles and bunkers. The loss of many mines over the past three years has also been marked by tragic and painful battles.</p>
<p>Mobile Fortress</p>
<p>The press corps visited the locomotive factory, steel mill, paper mill, and textile mill here. In addition to the normal repair of locomotives, passenger and freight trains, the locomotive factory spent six months building a "Revival" locomotive and a "Awakening Lion" mobile fortress. The walls of this fortress are made of 150 cm thick cement, with rifle ports, machine gun ports, and artillery ports. It can accommodate 20 soldiers. Even if the tracks are destroyed, it contains enough food for 15 days, allowing them to fight in isolation without fear. Other military weapons include improved rockets, which were the weapons that ultimately defeated the bandits in the Datong Defense Battle last year, and the Type 36 7.5 cm mountain gun, which has a range of 8,000 meters. In order to ensure the smooth progress of these tasks, a "struggle" wave was launched in the factory to purge the disguised enemy.</p>
<p>After Anshan fell into the hands of the bandits, the Northwest Steel Mill, built in imitation of the Krupp steel factory, became the only place in the country that could completely produce coke, iron, and steel. When coal and iron mines in Datong, Dingxiang, and other places could not be reached, these underground resources were found in the mountains east and west of Taiyuan after more than two years of exploration. Currently, 50 tons of pig iron and 60 tons of steel are produced daily, and the production is planned to increase to 200 tons this year. The main equipment of the factory includes two 5,000 kW turbine generators, one 240-ton regenerative coke oven with by-product recovery, one 120-ton and one 40-ton blast furnace each, and two 30-ton steel-making open hearth furnaces, and two sets of medium and small-sized steel rolling equipment.</p>
<p>Appealing for Support</p>
<p>The production increase plans of other factories have also been formulated. From these figures, it is not difficult to see the true face of the current central Shanxi industry: The machine factory has produced more than 700 various machines in the past two years, and plans to increase to 1,000 this year. The textile factory produces 20,000 bolts of 14-pound white cloth per month, and plans to increase to 40,000 bolts. The power plant currently has a maximum load of 10,000 kW and plans to increase to 30,000 kW. The No. 1 coal mine plans to increase from 30,000 tons per month to 60,000 tons. Currently, more than 20,000 employees work almost 10 hours or more every day. Wages are completely uniform, and an average of four sheng of wheat per person per day is calculated in kind, with half paid in kind and half converted into legal tender.</p>
<p>The biggest difficulty facing the Northwest Company is the severance of transportation. Last year, the company only managed to import 1,500 tons of raw materials and export 1,800 tons of products by air. They appeal: Politics, military affairs, and economy are mutually causal. Today, increasing military aid to Liaoyang and providing economic support to Taiyuan means stabilizing the Northeast and North China. And the stability of the Northeast and North China is also consolidating the cornerstone of the government. (Report from this newspaper, Yang Wenyu)</p>

<p>[Report from this Newspaper, Jiaxing, 7th] After several rounds of spring breezes and spring rains, green buds have sprouted on the mulberry branches, and peach blossoms are also budding, filling the air with the atmosphere of spring, adding a smile to every silent face.</p>
<p>The cries of "Going to South Lake!" have already been heard from the mouths of the boat women. Yes, South Lake is what Jiaxing can offer people for spring outings. However, it is too aristocratic. Hiring a maiden's boat costs more than a million yuan. Just to take the ferry to Yanyu Tower costs at least 100,000 to 200,000 yuan. The number of tourists this spring is not as many as in previous years, but the railway nursery seems to be attracting more attention from tourists.</p>
<p>Conscription and Grain Collection</p>
<p>After the beginning of spring, conscription and grain collection in Jiaxing are at a tense juncture. Senior officials from the province have come to Jiaxing almost ten times during this period. At the same time, county-level personnel are also mostly touring the townships to supervise and assist in the collection. As for the township and pao-jia organizations, it goes without saying.</p>
<p>One thing worth praising in this year's conscription work in Jiaxing is that, so far, there have been no cases of fraud, which is a significant improvement compared to previous years. It is hoped that this integrity can be maintained until the end. As for the family settlement fees for volunteers, the amount is considerable, at 15 shi of coarse rice per person. The settlement fees collected by the township offices from the recruits are also calculated in rice, at 5 dou of coarse rice per person.</p>
<p>Regarding land tax, 241,000 shi have been collected so far. Jiaxing's total quota is 390,000 shi, so more than 60% has been collected. The collection is still being stepped up, and according to personnel in the land tax office, it is likely to reach 80% by the end of this month.</p>
<p>For households with old tax debts and large tenant farmers who are in arrears, County Magistrate Pan personally invited the landlords for talks in his private capacity, urging them to pay through persuasion. This approach has yielded great results in the collection of land tax.</p>
<p>Cultural Crisis</p>
<p>Jiaxing's cultural undertakings are relatively developed compared to other counties. It is not easy to see three broadsheet newspapers (Jiaxing Commercial Daily, Jia District Republican Daily, National Daily) in a county town with a population of 420,000. However, the Lunar New Year was passed smoothly, but the onslaught of spring prices has become difficult to cope with. Newsprint has reached the 3 million yuan mark per ream, and employee salaries are increasing with the cost of living. In order to make up for the huge deficit, the price of newspapers has been raised continuously, and advertising rates have been adjusted. As a result, circulation has shrunk, and revenue has still not been able to increase. The plan to expand the business has finally failed. In order to sustain themselves in the days to come, the newspaper industry association has held emergency meetings for days, but has not come up with a satisfactory solution to the seriousness of the problem. The reporter speculates that the final solution to this problem may be the merger of the three newspapers. The reason why they are struggling to support themselves now is that they hope that the allocated newsprint can be purchased at a price within a short period of time in order to save themselves. Otherwise, the continuation of their survival may be very questionable.</p>
<p>Gambling Wind Not Checked</p>
<p>Hangjiahu has been known as the land of fish and rice. Because of the past abundance of food and clothing, the extravagant and decadent life of the people of Jiaxing has developed today. After years of anesthetic education by the enemy and puppets, the simple customs have changed. During the Spring Festival, the prevalence of gambling in Jiaxing can be said to have set a new record in previous years. The number of casinos has spread to every corner of the county, and there are even incredible stories of betting with 20 taels of gold. Although the local authorities have implemented township autonomy pacts in order to curb the gambling wind, stipulating that those who gamble and are arrested must be fined between 200,000 and 1 million in cash, which will be used as funds for township autonomy, its effect is minimal.</p>
<p>In order to catch gamblers, many unfortunate incidents have occurred in the police bureau. For example, gamblers booked rooms 105 and 106 in the Taihua Inn in the eastern gate of the city, gathering day and night to gamble wildly for several months. When the police bureau dispatched Police Chief Song Tianpei to lead eight police officers to arrest them, they were resisted by the gamblers with their large number of people, and instead suffered gunshot wounds. Chief Song was shot in the right waist, and the bullet exited from the left abdomen. By the time a large number of police officers arrived, the place had long been deserted. Although the injured did not die, they have not yet been discharged from the hospital. A similar incident also occurred in Zhongdai Township. Police officers who arrested gamblers were tied up, insulted, and forced to write "confessions" before being released. In addition, there were also incidents of councilors being beaten for trying to stop gambling, which is truly shocking!</p>
<p>Conservative Superstition</p>
<p>In addition to gambling, during the Spring Festival, people are busy staging operas to thank the gods and worship Buddha. The peasants have never been able to get rid of the concepts of "conservatism" and "superstition." They always attribute what they harvest in the fields to the "Buddha," so they don't care about spending a huge amount of money on staging operas to thank the gods and worship Buddha! The method of raising funds is mostly calculated based on the amount of land, for example, raising 10,000 yuan or 1 sheng of rice per mu of land, which is very easy. If it is for public undertakings, such as raising funds for township education, it is more difficult than begging for food, because they simply look down on scholars, and they don't want their children to study, because today's scholars are not as good as those who wield hoes. They can eat four full meals a day, with fish and meat, and get a salary of five sheng of white rice. Which civil servant's treatment can match theirs? This is another sad reality in the countryside today. (Report from this newspaper, Chen Jianxiong)</p>

<p>[Report from this Newspaper, Fuzhou, 7th] One of the largest bridges in Fujian Province, the Fuzhou Wanshou Bridge (commonly known as "Daqiaotou"), is entirely built of steel, reinforced concrete, and stone, with a total length of 382 meters, spanning the Min River and being very imposing. During the Rongyu turmoil in 1944, when the Sino-American Mixed Air Force came to bomb Rongcheng, two holes in the main body of the bridge were destroyed by bombs. In order to maintain the transportation of the entire city, the enemy forces immediately used wooden beams to pave the bridge the next day. After the victory, it has been used until now. The Rongcheng government previously requested the central government to find a way to repair it. Now, a concrete reply has been received. The funds for the repair are approved to be raised, and the materials part is approved to be allocated six steel beams by the Fuzhou-Xiamen Highway Engineering Office for application. The city government has sent someone to collect them. If the funds are allocated, construction can begin in the shortest possible time.</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper Taixian Dispatch, 4th] An unidentified male corpse was discovered on the 3rd in a pillbox in the northeast corner of the city. The deceased appeared to be in his thirties, dressed in a gray foreign crepe cotton robe, a gray factory cloth coat, and black foreign crepe cotton trousers. His head was wrapped with five or six sets of cotton rope, his face was covered in mud, his tongue was slightly protruding, and the tip of his tongue was bitten through. His nose bridge was broken, and there was a wound in the back of his head. Next to the corpse was a yellow, plain military cap and a piece of city brick stained with blood. There were no identification documents on his person, so his identity remains unknown. Inside his undershirt, a red paper package was found containing a piece of gold, weighing about two taels. From various signs, it is suspected that this case is a murder for financial gain. The corpse was inspected by a coroner dispatched by the District Procuratorate and then taken for burial by the Ba長 (local leader) with a written guarantee. The gold piece is being held on record by the District Procuratorate.</p>

<p>The pagoda rises like a spring,</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper Xi'an Air Dispatch, 1st] People who have been to Xi'an are mostly familiar with the Big and Small Goose Pagodas. The main reason is that it is a famous Buddhist temple and has a Goose Pagoda as high as three hundred feet. Every year after the fifteenth day of the first lunar month, the sixteenth day is the grand Goose Pagoda Festival. The citizens of Xi'an go to the Ci'en Temple in droves. Outside the South Gate, carriages and horses gather, loudly shouting, "Who's going! Going to visit the Big Goose Pagoda." From the Tang Dynasty to the present, it has been like this every year. Except for the flames of war that burned Chang'an, this ancient festival is always lively.</p>
<p>The Great Ci'en Temple</p>
<p>Located seven li south of Xi'an's southern suburbs, the Big Goose Pagoda is inside the temple. According to historical records, it was established in the 22nd year of Zhenguan by Emperor Gaozong for Empress Wende. It now occupies about thirty mu, and its scale is far from the past glory of "double-layered buildings, cloud pavilions, and cave chambers." Only old buildings remain, paired with crumbling walls, covered with wind, sand, and dust, creating a desolate sight. If it weren't for the towering seven-story pagoda still standing, perhaps no one would visit anymore.</p>
<p>The Goose Pagoda is in the back courtyard of the temple. Xi'an people call it the Big Goose Pagoda to distinguish it from the Small Goose Pagoda in the Dafu Temple. It has seven stories, with brick on the outside and earth on the inside. It is said that in the past, there were over a thousand relics on each floor. The inside of the pagoda is hollow, with stairs for climbing, spiraling upwards to the highest floor. If the weather is clear, looking north towards Xi'an, everything is clearly visible as if in a painting. The surrounding rivers and mountains are all in view. At the bottom of the pagoda, there is a stone tablet inscribed by Chu Suiliang of the Tang Dynasty. Now, due to rubbings throughout the ages, the writing is slightly blurred. The carvings on the tablet are detailed, far beyond the ordinary. It is said that this is a famous stele in calligraphy collections.</p>
<p>Even though the writing is not clear now, the black stains on the tablet show that people are still making rubbings.</p>
<p>South of the pagoda, across two heavenly halls, are numerous stone tablets. This is the famous "Goose Pagoda Inscriptions." Since the Tang Dynasty, scholars who passed the imperial examinations would come to the Goose Pagoda and inscribe their names on the stone tablets, hoping to be remembered for generations. Later, the capital was moved to other places, and the Goose Pagoda Inscriptions no longer saw imperial graduates. Only the licentiates and students from the Shaanxi provincial examinations inscribed their names. Now, the inscription tablets are far from the original ones, with only the provincial examination tablets from the Ming and Qing dynasties remaining.</p>
<p>Two li south from the Goose Pagoda is the Qujiang Pool. During the Sui and Tang dynasties, this was a popular spring outing destination.</p>
<p>Ladies were as numerous as clouds, and the scenery was luxurious. They were mostly famous ministers and even used rouge as red bait, hanging it on poles and leading horses forward. As the saying goes, "The six dragons travel south to the Furong Garden, and the fragrance drifts ten li into Wucheng." Now, only some villages remain. Except for the Goose Pagoda Festival, when there are many tourists, it is usually like any common village in the north. During the Anti-Japanese War, a part of the Central Military Academy trained here, painting all the walls in the village anew. But now it has "returned to its original state."</p>
<p>Wujiapo is located southeast of Qujiang, in a gully. This gully is what is known as the Honggou River in Beijing opera. "Cold Kiln" is on the south bank of the gully. According to people, this is where Wang Baochuan waited eighteen years for Pinglang to return. Now, the outside of the cave is neatly arranged with houses, and even the cave where Wang Sanjie sat is now paved with ancient bricks and bluestone. The smoke and fire are more prosperous than in other places, and the cave is small and crowded, with a warm atmosphere, without a trace of "cold." There is little vegetation on both banks of the Honggou River. Further away, it is again covered with vegetation, perhaps due to the soil. However, the locals say that Wang Sanjie ate all the vegetable during the eighteen years of cold and hunger. Wujiapo is also called Wudianpo. It is not recorded in the Xi'an gazetteer, and like its protagonist, it is unknown. It became famous in the twentieth century due to the opera "Red Mane Stallion."</p>
<p>A villager from Qujiang Pool told the reporter that an inglorious thing happened in their village last year. The wife of a soldier who had been away for three years could not bear to sleep alone and committed adultery. Her husband's uncle discovered it and sued her in the Chang'an court. She was convicted according to the law. This is a common tragedy in wartime, but it is thought-provoking that it happened near Wang Sanjie's "Cold Kiln."</p>
<p>In all the temples, people were seeking divine guidance. Many old ladies, with faces of sincerity, knelt before the Buddha statues, holding divination sticks, shaking them, and telling the clay figures that their sons had gone to war and there had been no news for several years, asking the gods for guidance. One of them sighed after getting up: "When will there be peace?" Tears streamed down her face. In times of turmoil and famine, those who have not been educated have even less faith in people. They all place their hopes at the feet of the gods. (Our Newspaper Reporter Zhang Xianzhou)</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper Jinshan Dispatch, 6th] The Zhangnian Sub-Bureau in Jinshan, based on the confession of drug trafficker Pan Fushou, recently sent agents to Tinglin Town in Songjiang County to purchase a small packet of heroin (valued at 100,000 yuan). They also seized a large quantity of drugs on the spot. Before the agents arrived, the town's self-defense team, led by the deputy captain and seven or eight armed soldiers, surrounded Police Chief Wu. Using the pretext of contacting the town government, Police Chief Wu explained the case and presented his warrant. The deputy captain unreasonably tore it up and confiscated his No. 2 pistol, allowing the drug trafficker Li Huixiang to escape. When the agents arrived and negotiated, they learned that the son of the drug trafficker Li Huixiang was a member of the self-defense team, hence the self-defense team shielded and indulged him. The negotiation was ineffective. The Zhangnian Sub-Bureau has urgently reported to the County Bureau, which has reported to the County Government. It is reported that County Chief Wang of Jinshan has telegraphed County Chief Xu of Songjiang for investigation.</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper Wujin Dispatch, 7th] Unemployed vagrants Wu Qi-da and Ye Jinxiang from Henglin, and Shu Bao-chen from Danyang colluded to privately set up a "tax checkpoint" at the canal dock in front of Ding Town, west of Qishuyan Town. They planted a national flag and forced passing boats to dock, extorting millions or hundreds of thousands of yuan depending on the size of the boat. They created a fabricated name "National Flag Donation", but after donating, they did not give a national flag, only a printed flag purchase certificate. Wu, Ye, and Shu all wore military uniforms, similar to tax police, so boatmen dared to be angry but did not dare to speak out. The city defense learned of this and sent personnel to the countryside to arrest them, seizing eighteen national flags of various sizes, a large book of flag purchase certificates, half a book of "National Flag Usage Essentials", seven order forms, and a round seal of "China National Flag Society Distribution Office". They were immediately taken to the Sixth Military Law Group for interrogation. According to their confession, they colluded to set up checkpoints for extortion. They also claimed that similar situations existed along the canal in Danyang, Benniu, Lucheng, Suzhou, Shanghai, and other places. Whether this is an organized group or serves other purposes is still under investigation.</p>
<p>Yiguang Highway Under Construction</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper Yixing Dispatch] The Yiguang Highway, which spans the Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui border regions and connects to the Beijing-Hangzhou National Highway, starts from Yixing in Jiangsu Province and ends in Guangde in Anhui Province, with a total length of 160 li. It meanders and winds, and the vehicles pass through mountains and foothills. Before the Anti-Japanese War, the entire road project was completed. However, it was deliberately destroyed during the enemy's invasion. Since the victory, the bandit atmosphere in the border regions of the three provinces has been restless, and orders have been given to rebuild it. Currently, the 60 li from Yixing to Zhangzhu, the bridges and culverts have been gradually repaired, and it is expected to be open to traffic soon. From Zhangzhu to Guangde, civilian labor is being mobilized to build it in sections. The sectional method stipulates that each Bao completes a certain number of Li, which doubles the efficiency and saves financial resources. If the entire road is restored, it will not only facilitate military operations and suppress bandits, but also allow for the full exploitation of mineral and mountain resources, greatly increasing exports and laying the foundation for the livelihood of the people in the border region.</p>

<h3 id="e139">Secretary of the British Universities China Committee to Visit China; Purpose is to Visit Educational Institutions <a href="#e139" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c139" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">139</a></h3>
<p>[British Information Service London Dispatch, 8th] The British Universities China Committee, whose main purpose is to promote Sino-British cultural relations and which serves as the British agent for the Board of Trustees of the Sino-British Educational and Cultural Endowment Fund, has been settling and caring for students sent to the UK by the Board of Trustees for fifteen years. Up to now, there have been nine groups of students, totaling about 200 people, all of whom have obtained higher degrees in the UK, without exception. There are also quite a few who have distinguished themselves in various research fields. After completing their studies, they have all taken on important jobs in their home countries, with university teaching being the most common.</p>
<p>Mr. Maughill, the secretary of the China Committee, set off by plane on the 6th to visit Hong Kong, and then to Shanghai, Nanjing, and other places. The purpose is to meet with leaders in the Chinese education community and visit educational institutions, so as to directly learn what kind of most beneficial assistance the UK can provide to China in this area. It is expected that he will stay in China for more than a month.</p>
<p>Before his departure, Mr. Maughill told reporters about the past achievements of the China Committee and the purpose of his visit to China: "We dare to say that this project has contributed to promoting mutual respect and strengthening cultural ties between the two countries. The purpose of my trip is to discuss the future of this project with the Board of Trustees, as well as some practical issues involved in the implementation of the project. I will also ask them to make suggestions on other ways in which the Committee can serve China. The Committee hopes to express its confidence in the future of China on a small scale and is willing to cooperate closely with people who have many common points in terms of concepts. The Board of Trustees is deeply grateful for this expression of trust, as it sent its last group of scholarship students to the UK when life in our country was difficult. The chairman of the Board of Trustees visited the UK from 1945 to 1946 and visited several universities in our country. I hope to visit some universities in China as well. Some scholars from the Board of Trustees have come to the UK to study animal husbandry. Dr. Zhang, a professor of animal husbandry at National Sichuan University, is currently investigating animal husbandry methods and conditions here. As a countryman, I especially hope to see such departments and experimental venues in China, if time permits. But practical problems in daily life that can be helped by Sino-British universities to seek solutions are only one aspect. The vision of Chinese universities will help to provide all the categories of science in which students and experts from both countries can mutually benefit from the exchange of methods and conditions. I really want to see China, about which I have heard a lot but know very little."</p>

<h3 id="e142">Sichuan Education Institute to Become a University: Preparatory Committee Established, Deng Xihou Appointed as Chairman <a href="#e142" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c142" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">142</a></h3>
<p>[Our Chongqing Dispatch, 5th] In July of the 21st year of the Republic of China (1932), the Sichuan Post-War Rehabilitation Supervisory Office specially invited Gan Jiyong to purchase 1,400 mu of land in Longyin Township, Ba County, to establish a rural normal school specialized program, which is the predecessor of today's Sichuan Provincial Education Institute. In July of the following year, it merged with the Sichuan Central Agricultural Experiment Field and expanded into the Sichuan Rural Construction Institute, with "Social Studies" and "Agriculture" departments. This expanded the scale and contributed significantly to rural governance and agricultural improvement in Sichuan Province.</p>
<p>After Gan Jiyong became the Director of the Sichuan Provincial Department of Finance, he resigned from the position of Dean in August of the 24th year of the Republic of China (1935), and Gao Xianjian succeeded him. The Ministry of Education deemed that the structure of the institute did not align with the current academic system. In June of the 25th year of the Republic of China (1936), it was proposed to reorganize the institute into the Sichuan Provincial Education Institute, with the departments renamed to (1) Social Education Department and (2) Agricultural Education Department. Subsequently, it collaborated with the Administrative Commissioner's Office of the Third District of Sichuan Province to conduct experimental zones in nine counties under its jurisdiction, using the power of education to assist in advancing political facilities. The results were remarkable.</p>
<p>During the Anti-Japanese War, Gao Xianjian resigned due to illness, and     Xin took over the post. Subsequently, Education and Chinese Language special programs were added, increasing the "Chinese Language," "Mathematics," "English," "Agronomy," and "Agricultural Chemistry" departments. After Dr. Chai Youheng, who had a doctorate in education from the University of Paris, became the President of the institute, the "History and Geography," "Natural History," and "Horticulture" departments were established. As of now, the institute has eleven departments, more than twenty classes, and over six hundred students (including over two hundred female students). The spacious campus has long possessed the foundation of a university with faculties of Arts, Sciences, Agriculture, and Education.</p>
<p>Since the victory, to commemorate this holy site of national revival, the National Political Council suggested that the institute be upgraded to a university. The Sichuan Provincial Assembly also made several decisions to this effect. Therefore, there was a strike starting on January 19th, marking the third school expansion movement since the establishment of the Sichuan Education Institute.</p>
<p>The Sichuan Provincial Government, in its provincial affairs meeting on February 27th, re-deliberated and decided to establish a preparatory committee for the university upgrade. Chairman Deng Xihou was appointed as the director of the committee, with Deputy Director and Secretary-General Deng Hanxiang, and Education Director Ren Juewu. The other members of the committee included Xiang Chuanyi, Wu Jingbo, Chai Youheng, and twelve others. The first meeting of the committee was held in Chengdu on the first day of this month, and the plan for the university upgrade was discussed in detail. However, according to the results of various interviews by our newspaper reporters, the supplementary examination for the last semester and the start date for this semester have not yet been decided as of the time of publication. This is because the minimum requirements of the school expansion committee are: (A) Insisting on the name "Peidu University" (Wartime Capital University), and the preparations must be completed within this semester, and students should be enrolled under the name of the university in the next semester. (B) Immediately allocate the school construction funds of 60,000 shi of yellow grain and 3 billion in national currency, which were approved by the Provincial Affairs Conference on February 27th. President Chai Youheng and student representatives Peng Zhifu, Peng Qiyu, Li Wenyang, and others will only return to Chongqing from Chengdu after the above two recommendations of the Expansion Committee have received a definite response.

<h3 id="e144">This Week's First Division Football: Dongqing to Play Simultaneously, Separately Facing the Kang Team and the Jewish Team; Second and Third Divisions to Hold Finals <a href="#e144" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c144" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">144</a></h3>
<p>In addition to the First Division which is yet to continue, the divisions of the second and third tiers have already entered the finals stage. The schedule for this week was arranged and announced yesterday by the organizing committee. After the Mayor's Cup loss, the two giants of the First Division, Donghua and Qingbai, will play against the Kang Team and the Jewish Team on Saturday and Sunday, respectively, both competing at the Yiyuan Stadium. In addition, the second division final, Qunli vs. Central Aviation, will be held at 10:00 AM on Sunday at Yiyuan. The Youth Cup and the Third Division Third Group finals are all scheduled to take place at the Zhongzheng Public National Stadium.</p>
<p>The organizing committee stipulates that the finals of the second and third divisions will adopt an elimination system. If the second division match ends in a tie, it will be extended by 30 minutes (15 minutes each half), and the third division will be extended by 20 minutes (10 minutes each half). If there is still no winner, the match will be replayed on another day.</p>
<p>In Saturday afternoon's first division match, Qingbaiqing meets the Jiji Team. Qingbaiqing is the champion team of the previous Mayor's Cup. In this year's football league, they have been victorious in every match since their debut and are determined to win the league championship. The whole team has been practicing hard since returning to Shanghai from the inter-city competition in Hong Kong, and they are indeed a formidable opponent for all teams in the first division. Although the Kang Team is a rising force this year, they lack experience, leading to defeats in every match. Meeting a strong opponent on Saturday, defeat is undoubtedly inevitable.</p>
<p>In the other match, Donghua vs. the Jewish team, Donghua has been recruiting troops and expanding its operations in Hong Kong to consolidate its strength in the football season. In addition to Xie Jinhong, who has already shown his face in Shanghai a few days ago, Guo Yingqi will soon report for duty. Several other generals will also come to Shanghai from Hong Kong in succession. Judging from their active reorganization, it is conceivable that they have great ambitions for the championship. The Jewish team is not weak and has a reputation as a dark horse in the football world. Although their talent is uneven this year, their strength is still profound and unpredictable. When Donghua meets them, they must proceed with caution. The schedule for this week is recorded below:</p>
<p>March 13 (Saturday)</p>
<p>Qingbaiqing—Kang Team (First Division) 3:00 PM, Yiyuan Stadium</p>
<p>March 14 (Sunday)</p>
<p>Donghua—Jewish Team (First Division) 3:00 PM, Yiyuan Stadium</p>

Then, the disputes in the Central and Western districts were discussed. It was generally agreed that the spirit should be the most important thing in the competition. The successive reports of abandonment by the Meiqi Yuecai teams were due to misunderstandings. It was decided to appoint Committee Members Zhang Ziheng and Zhang Haotang as mediators for both parties, hoping that they would accept the competition to be in line with the association's purpose of promotion. As for the rumors that the Nanyang team in the Western District had non-union members participating, there was no evidence from other teams, so it was not discussed. The last match between the Post Office and Nanyang in that district was held a few days ago. As a result, the Post Office defeated Nanyang with a score of 4 to 3, winning the championship, and Nanyang took the runner-up. The results of both sides and the full rankings are recorded below:</p>

<h3 id="e154">Regrets from the First Round Not Yet Dissipated: Dagong and Chenyou Meet Again: Three First Division Matches in Tonight's Basketball League <a href="#e154" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c154" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">154</a></h3>
<p>The third basketball league will hold three matches as usual starting at 5:30 PM today, still in the gymnasium of the Municipal Gymnasium. Tickets will still be sold for 30,000 yuan upstairs and 60,000 yuan downstairs, and the Siwei Boy Scouts are invited to maintain order on site. The program for today is recorded below:</p>
<p>Jianle—Dahua (Second Division A) 5:30 PM Referees: Jin Botao Jin Jiabiao</p>
<p>Donghua—Jiashen (Second Division B) 6:30 PM Referees: Zheng Zhifang Xuan Hegao</p>
<p>Dagong—Chenyou (First Division) 7:30 PM Referees: Liu Hesheng Wu Zibin</p>
<p>Second Division Matches</p>
<p>In the first match, Jianle vs. Dahua, Jianle is organized by members of the Youth Association. The warriors under its command are extremely rich in experience on the basketball court. However, due to the job-related relationships of each team member, they do not often practice, so sometimes the contact is not enough. Today, meeting Dahua, the situation between Dahua and Jianle is similar, and the outcome of the battle is difficult to predict. And the victory or defeat of the two teams in this group has little to do with the overall situation, and at the time of engagement, Jianle may be able to overcome Dahua.</p>
<p>In the second act, Second Division B group, Donghua and Jiashen face off. Looking at the past results of this group, both sides have been able to maintain undefeated, and they have become established with equal strength. They have become incompatible, and they are all trying to grab the championship seat in the group. The warriors of both teams are equally full of long-term strength. Donghua is mostly famous football players, accustomed to driving, and Jiashen is relatively more advantageous in terms of contact. Victory is king, defeat is bandit, this move is extremely important. At that time, each will fight with all its strength, and it is not difficult to predict that it will be tense and exciting.</p>
<p>Enemies Meet on a Narrow Road</p>
<p>The final battle, First Division Group Dagong reunites with Changyou. Looking at the first encounter between the two teams in the first round, Dagong had just returned from attending the charity match in Beijing and was exhausted, while Chenyou fought like a trapped beast. Dagong was poisoned by Chenyou with a one-point difference. This reunion, enemies meet on a narrow road, Dagong will do its best to avenge its revenge today. Dagong's recent performances, Tu Wenlong and Cai Zhongqiang have made rapid progress, Cai Wentong's heroic demeanor is as before, and Cai Lianke plans and instructs on the overall situation, so the spirit of the whole army is quite radiant. Chenyou is a dark horse in this league, especially in the battle against Renyu a few days ago, its strength is unpredictable. Tonight, facing a formidable enemy, it is naturally fully prepared, and once it comes into contact, the intensity of the situation will be one of the most attractive scenes tonight.</p>
<p>(Dagong) Cai Lianke, Cai Wenhua, Tu Wenlong, Cai Zhongqiang, Huang Bailing, Zhan Chen, Zhang Gensheng, Wang Nanqun, Cai Wenzhang.</p>

<h3 id="e158">Prices at Production Sites Continue to Rise; Rice Prices Break New Highs; Arrival Volume Does Not Decrease; Owners Hold on to Prices and Refuse to Sell <a href="#e158" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c158" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">158</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's rice market was even more volatile. It is rumored that China National Cereals, Oils and Foodstuffs Corporation (COFCO) is purchasing in Wuxi, and prices continue to rise, which has affected the Shanghai market. However, yesterday's arrivals increased compared to the previous day, with a total of 11,195 dan arriving in the north and south markets. However, the owners sold less, resulting in few samples matched by brokers, and few old samples. Prices rose sharply in the morning market due to the strong support of the owners. In the North Market, special high-quality japonica rice was once quoted at 3.9 million, and Xibai japonica rice was quoted at 3.8 million. At the close, prices fell back, with special high-quality japonica rice at 3.88 million, Xibai japonica rice at 3.7 million yuan, and thin indica rice at 3.7 million yuan, all up nearly 400,000 yuan compared to the closing price last weekend. Baiyuan was also at 3.7 million, and Yinyuan was at 3.65 million. Prices in the South Market were 100,000 yuan lower than in the North Market, with Bai japonica rice and thin indica rice each at 3.6 million yuan.</p>
<p>Flour</p>
<p>The speculative atmosphere is very strong, with fluctuations of as much as 80,000 yuan. The morning opening was due to the sharp rise in rice prices, and the owners took this opportunity to raise prices significantly. Old Car brand flour actually reached 1.56 million yuan, an increase of more than 100,000 yuan compared to last week. In the end, because the opening price was too high, actual sales decreased, and the wind turned. Old Car closed at 1.48 million. Bingchuan opened at 1.53 million, but closed at 1.47 million, still up 40,000 to 50,000 compared to last weekend. Hongfeng and Jiancheng both opened at 1.52 million and closed at 1.46 million. The market situation for bran is also the same.</p>
<p>Miscellaneous Grains</p>
<p>Soybeans opened the highest. Due to the insistence of both buyers and sellers, trading only started very late. Hankou Zhaza beans initially opened at 1.75 million, but later due to sluggish sales, it fell slightly to 1.72 million, and finally to 1.7 million, and it was still not easy to sell. Raw peanuts from Guangdong were slightly absorbed, and the price rose by 200,000 to 300,000 yuan. Mung beans also rose by more than 200,000 yuan. Although Tianjin sesame was not taken, it also followed the rise in rice prices. Hankou white sesame was 3.3 million, and Jiujiang milk sesame was 3.05 million, each rising by more than 200,000 yuan. Corn was affected by electricity problems in Qingdao, which prevented flour milling. Although the four arrivals of grain all rose, corn alone fell by 50,000 yuan. Jianqing rose by 100,000, and red sorghum rose by 50,000.</p>
<p>Cooking Oil</p>
<p>There has been no shortage of arrivals recently, and market prices could have been stable. However, with the rise in rice prices, the owners' minds are quite firm and they are trying their best to raise prices. Recycled factory soybean oil initially opened at 6.7 million (Tongfeng), and later the factory also opened slightly at 6.68 million, up about 250,000 compared to last weekend. Raw rapeseed oil rose by 150,000, and the closing price of raw oil was even weaker. Qingdao Jibao raw oil initially opened at 7.7 million yuan, but later retreated to 7.6 million, and finally the slightly inferior goods were only quoted at 7.5 million yuan. Jiangbei Jibao raw Shantou oil was also 7.5 million yuan, which was about the same as the closing price last week. Chongqing Jibao cooked rapeseed oil hit the 7 million mark, and small car sesame oil rose by 250,000 yuan. Soybean cake initially rose by 20,000 to 30,000, but later also fell back, and the result was the same as last week.</p>
<p>[Reported by This Newspaper] The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Hai Su freighter, which transported 8,853 tons of foreign rice from Rangoon, arrived at the port at 4:00 PM yesterday and is currently berthed at Yangjiadu Wharf in Pudong for unloading.</p>
<h3 id="e159">COFCO Denies Purchasing Rice in Wuxi <a href="#e159" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c159" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">159</a></h3>
<p>It is rumored that the fluctuation of rice prices in this city is due to COFCO's large-scale purchases in Wuxi. According to the person in charge of the business section of COFCO's Shanghai office, the company has not purchased rice in Wuxi at all in the past two weeks, and only processed 2,000 dan of original rice in the Wuxi rice mill. He also said that the company currently has only 300 million yuan in deposits in Wuxi banks, which has not been used at all. This proves that someone is purchasing rice in Wuxi, which has nothing to do with the company. At present, the company's main business is to purchase rice from the producing areas in Hubei and Jiangxi provinces under the entrustment of the Food Bureau, and to transport food to the Northeast and Taiwan. The most recent 136,000 bags of flour from the Food Bureau were recently sent to Taiwan by the company.</p>

In recent days, merchants from the northern and Yangtze River regions, along the Shanghai-Nanjing-Hangzhou line, have been coming to Shanghai to purchase goods in increasing numbers.

If any illegal manufacturers privately trade cotton, raise prices, or disrupt the market, once discovered, the cotton will be confiscated and dealt with severely according to law.</p>
<p>Cotton Yarn Soars</p>
<p>Yesterday, cotton yarn market conditions saw prices soaring due to dwindling local raw cotton supplies. Manufacturers, fearing supply shortages, were agitated.

<h3 id="e167">Industrial and Commercial Guidance Office Plans to Develop China's Rubber Industry <a href="#e167" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c167" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">167</a></h3>
<p>The Industrial and Commercial Guidance Office believes that rubber industrial products are directly related to national defense industries and are of great importance to people's daily life. However, the domestic rubber industry has been unable to fully develop its capabilities and achieve self-sufficiency due to insufficient rubber import quotas. In order to develop this industry, the office yesterday drafted a plan to promote the industry and submitted it to the Ministry of Economic Affairs for review and approval. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>The maximum monthly rubber requirement for all rubber factories in domestic ports such as Shanghai, Taiwan, Qingdao, Tianjin, Guangzhou, and Shenyang is approximately 3,800 tons. The current difficulties are: (1) Insufficient rubber import quotas to meet actual needs, so factories cannot fully utilize their production capacity. (2) Too many newly established small-scale rubber factories, whose purpose is to collect officially priced rubber and resell it on the black market for profit, causing further panic for raw materials for large factories. (3) The domestic annual demand for automobile tires is approximately 270,000 sets. Currently, only factories such as Great China, Zhengtai, Qilu, and Shenyang are manufacturing, with an annual output of less than 100,000 sets, a difference of more than 170,000 sets. Machinery for manufacturing automobile tires must be imported, and rubber factories cannot easily obtain foreign exchange, so they cannot increase production. (4) The manufacturing of V-belts and rubber belts is relatively developed in Shanghai. If imports are prohibited, this industry will become more prosperous. Promotion methods: (1) Increase rubber import quotas; (2) Restrict the establishment of new factories. New factories that produce products such as galoshes and running shoes will not be allocated foreign exchange; (3) Allow the import of machinery for manufacturing automobile tires, and stipulate that the import volume of automobile tires will reach self-sufficiency within three years; (4) The quality of domestic V-belts and rubber mass can meet the needs of various industries, and regulations should be put in place to gradually restrict imports. If the above plan can be implemented, it is expected to achieve the following results: (1) Stipulate the monthly import volume of raw rubber to meet actual needs. (2) Promulgate regulations for the allocation of foreign exchange for newly established factories. (3) Find ways to subsidize private factories to purchase new modern machinery from foreign countries, and then establish factories capable of manufacturing 20,000 sets of automobile tires (both large and small) per month.

<h3 id="e168">In Memory of Professor Whitehead <a href="#e168" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c168" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">168</a></h3>
<p>— Xie Youwei</p>
<p>Professor Alfred North Whitehead, a great figure in the contemporary academic world, passed away on December 20, 1947, in Cambridge, Massachusetts, USA. He was eighty-six years old. The death of this great master seems to have gone unnoticed in the newspapers in our country. It has been two months since Whitehead's death, and only now has the author learned of this news from an American magazine. Although the news is late, my feelings of sorrow and respect have not diminished. I am writing this to express my admiration and respect.</p>
<p>Whitehead was not only a great philosopher but also a great scientist. His achievements in learning are beyond doubt. In terms of his position in the history of Western philosophy, his position can certainly be compared with Plato, Aristotle, Kant, Hegel, and, more recently, with Bradley, Bergson, Dewey, and Russell. In terms of the breadth, depth, subtlety, and infinity of his thought, we can say that Whitehead is today's Hegel. Anyone who has read Whitehead's books must share the author's feelings. As for his status as a scientist, his research on the principles of mathematics is enough to establish him as a master in his own right. The book "Principia Mathematica," co-authored with Russell, has become a classic for those engaged in mathematical logic. Even pure mathematicians cannot ignore it. His book "Science and the Modern World" is unique in its exposition of scientific principles. Therefore, it is fitting to say that Whitehead was also a great scientist, and Whitehead deserves this title without shame.</p>
<p>Whitehead was British. He was born on February 15, 1861, in Ramsgate, on the Isle of Thanet, in Kent, England. His ancestors were engaged in education, religion, and local government. His grandfather, Thomas, was once the headmaster of a local private school. His father, Alfred, was also a teacher and later became a pastor. Whitehead grew up in such a family, so even though he later studied mathematics and philosophy, he also had a passion for education and religion. At the age of nineteen, he entered Cambridge University. After graduating, he worked at the university for more than twenty years. The courses he taught were mathematics. From 1911, he became a professor at the University of London. While in England, Whitehead had already written philosophical works, but the academic world did not yet regard him as a philosopher. In 1924, Harvard University in the United States hired Whitehead as a professor of philosophy. It was at this time that Whitehead really made philosophy his career. Since then, Whitehead's important philosophical works have gradually been published, his position has become increasingly secure, and his reputation has grown, and the philosophical world has had to regard him as a master of his generation.</p>
<p>Whitehead's main works include the following: (1) "A Treatise on Univercal Algebra" (1898), (2) "Principia Mathematica" (1910, co-authored with Russell), (3) "An Introduction to Mathematics" (1911), (4) "An Enquiry Concerning The Principles of Natural Knowle gc" (1919), (5) "The Concept of Nature" (1920), (6) "The Principle of Relativity" (1922), (7) "Science and The Mo r n World" (1925), (8) "Religion In The Making" (1926), (9) "Symbolism, Its Meaning and Effect" (1927), (10) "Proceos and Reality" (1926), (11) "The Function of Reacon" (1929), (12) "The Aims of Elucation and Other Essay" (1929), (13) "The Adventure of Ldeas" (1933), (14) "Modes of Thought" (1938), (15) "Essays in Science and Philosophy" (1947). Of the above books, only "Science and the Modern World" and a part of "Modes of Thought" discussing "Life and Nature" have Chinese translations (see the Commercial Press, Universal Library). To the author's knowledge, the rest have no Chinese translations. This is not because Chinese philosophers ignore Whitehead, but because Whitehead's books are extremely difficult to translate. If translated literally without explanation, even philosophical experts will find it difficult to understand.</p>
<p>Whitehead's thought cannot be described in this article. What can be briefly said is that various philosophical doctrines and schools of thought, such as idealism and realism, cannot be unconditionally applied to Whitehead. In the past, some people regarded Whitehead as a neo-realist, but after the development of Whitehead's thought, neo-realism could no longer encompass his thought. Whitehead himself called his school "the philosophy of organism" or "the philosophy of organic interdependence," meaning that everything in the universe is interconnected and interdependent, like an organism. He believes that the fundamental or real nature of the universe or nature is neither mind nor matter, but a kind of "event" or "actual entity." This "event" or "actual entity" is the ultimate reality of the universe, the basis for constituting the universe. Man and nature, or mind and matter, are all formed by this "actual entity" in different organizational forms. This "actual entity" has transience, so it is not fixed and static but is a process of activity. This "actual entity" also has extensibility, that is, one "actual entity" invades other "actual entities," and other "actual entities" also invade this one "actual entity," so they are not isolated but are interconnected. Therefore, everything in the universe is in a process of change, all influencing each other, all things are interwoven, one thing contains other things as its elements, and other things also contain this one thing as its elements. The Chinese saying, "One is all, and all is one," can be said to have this kind of meaning in Whitehead's philosophy.</p>
<p>Whitehead has many facets, and the author can only briefly mention one or two. When Whitehead taught at Harvard, many Chinese philosophers studied under him (such as He Lin, Shen Youding, Qu Xiaochen, etc.). From 1929 to 1931, the author also had the honor of being among his students. Although I am ashamed of my little understanding of my teacher's theories, I have a very deep impression of my teacher's personality. Whitehead's personality can be described as kind and approachable. Every Friday evening, Whitehead welcomed students to his home. Whitehead and his wife would greet them with smiles. Surrounded by a dozen or twenty students, he answered every question without any sign of fatigue. His kindness, sincerity, easygoing attitude, and profound words, even a few words, were enough to inspire people. He was truly a complete person in the academic world.</p>
<p>The above is a brief account of Whitehead's life, works, and thought. I respect Whitehead's thought, and I also respect Whitehead's personality. In terms of Whitehead's achievements, Whitehead is immortal.</p>

<h3 id="e169">On the Use of Two Languages <a href="#e169" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c169" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">169</a></h3>
<p>— Haoran</p>
<p>In large cities, people from all over gather, and many people learn to speak more than two languages, a phenomenon generally referred to as Bilingualism. In some cases, this is unavoidable. For example, some families who only speak Cantonese, if they live in Shanghai, may have to learn three languages: Cantonese at home, Shanghainese outside, and Mandarin at school. Many foreign children speak Chinese to their "Ama" [nanny], their native language to their parents, and "Pidgin English" to Westerners. These are all unavoidable. However, some families with a higher cultural level and a greater degree of Westernization are using very forced means to encourage their children to speak two languages—English at home and Chinese outside. This approach poses some potential dangers to children, which we will briefly mention here.</p>
<p>Does the use of two languages ​​have a negative impact on children's language development? The Frenchman J. Ronjat made a very careful observation of this. His son Loui spoke French with him but German with his mother. According to Ronjat, his son was no more behind in either language, whether speaking or reading, than someone who only learned one language. But the question is: Can this one case be used as a lesson? Not entirely.</p>
<p>The American D.T. Spoerl has published several papers on this issue. She believes that unless the two languages ​​are clearly separated, for example, the mother speaks German and never speaks a word of French, and the father only speaks French and never speaks German, without any confusion, development may be normal. If there is even a slight mix, the situation is not so ideal, and language development may at least be temporarily delayed. As for whether this impact is permanent, opinions are divided. The Englishman S.S. Laurie said: "If a child can learn two languages ​​at the same time and still be equally good, he is being ruined. His intellectual and cultural development is not doubled as a result, but halved."</p>
<p>Smith's research on the language development of various children in Hawaii showed that children aged two to six all experienced developmental delays due to using two languages. She said that bilingual speakers often use exclamatory short sentences and fewer complex sentences. The period of sentences specifically referring to object names is longer. General research seems to prove that the use of two languages ​​is detrimental to children's language development.</p>
<p>We know that the speech organs and hands are neurologically connected. The use of two languages ​​may affect actions. For example, one study asked children to raise their right hand, point to their left ear, and other actions, and bilingual speakers made more confusion, mistakes, and hesitation than monolingual speakers. Henss had a son who grew up in the Netherlands and only spoke Dutch until the age of four. He used both hands well. At the age of four, he entered a German school, and his German progressed quickly, but he began to use his right hand exclusively. When he grew up, he went to a German school again, and as a result, he used his right hand exclusively. At this time, he spoke Dutch and German equally well. At the same time, he began to stutter, and it only stopped when he left the Netherlands and forgot Dutch. Researchers unanimously agree that bilingual speakers are more likely to stutter.</p>
<p>The greatest danger of using two languages ​​seems to be emotional. Learning two languages ​​at the same time can be a heavy burden for people with below-average intelligence. If the teaching method is poor and there is slight confusion between the two languages, emotional conflicts may arise. Stuttering is one way of expressing this. Furthermore, language is a medium of culture. It can not only be used to convey meaning, but it is also a preserver of tradition. Each language represents a society. No two are completely comparable. For example, foreign children speak Chinese to their nannies and English to their parents. Then, Chinese becomes a humble language, and his personality when speaking Chinese is different from when he speaks English. In other words, because these two languages ​​represent two societies and two cultures, using two languages ​​inevitably leads to conflict—a conflict of two different statuses or values. A person, especially someone who is not strong and is still developing, may experience personality disintegration due to this conflict. This is a very serious danger. However, in adults, or in children with strong abilities, this conflict can be avoided. On the one hand, his synthesis ability is stronger, and on the other hand, his psychological structure is more distinct. The danger of using two languages ​​is not so obvious in adults, but it cannot be measured by adult standards in children.</p>
<h3 id="e170">The Relationship Between Mind and Body According to Bosanquet <a href="#e170" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c170" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">170</a></h3>
<p>— Han Yuwen</p>
<p>The mind is spiritual, and the body is material. The body occupies space and is limited by it; the mind does not occupy space and disregards spatial distances and boundaries. All bodily movements or changes in the brain are mechanically driven by the conditions of the body and are passive. Therefore, our unconscious bodily actions, strictly speaking, cannot be considered our own. Only actions originating from the spontaneous mind can be said to be truly our own, because the inherent nature of the mind is active, free, and creative, unlike that of material objects.</p>
<p>Given that the mind and body are so different, what is their relationship to each other? This is an age-old question. Dualists first affirm that the mind and matter are two completely different and independent entities. Then, they assert a causal relationship between them, claiming that bodily and mental actions influence each other. Bosanquet argues that this not only disrupts the connection between mind and body, misinterpreting their activities as requiring external causes, but also simultaneously considers the mind to be both non-material and material. This is, of course, an illogical argument.</p>
<p>As for parallelism, it eliminates the reality of both mind and matter, regarding them as two different attributes of a single spiritual entity. These two attributes each have their own set of causal order, and do not interfere with each other, yet correspond perfectly. This argument seems reasonable, but it still carries the suspicion of splitting mind and matter into two separate entities. Moreover, why can two completely different attributes have a completely corresponding order and function? This remains a difficult mystery to explain.</p>
<p>Subjective idealists only acknowledge the reality of the mind and deny the existence of matter. For example, Berkeley believed that everything in the world is an idea. They thus preserve the unity of mind and matter. However, Bosanquet argues that our minds cannot unconditionally be the cause of ideas and abilities, nor can they create or manufacture a superior organism. The unconscious natural phenomena in the universe are full of exquisite miracles that transcend human planning and creation. In the evolution of nature, material reactivity, attraction, and the like came first, followed by the life of organisms, and then the development of our minds. Therefore, the conscious mind is a later development. Our minds have an unconscious life, etc., as their foundation, and social consciousness or cultural spirit, etc., as their upper layer and ideal. Our minds can rather be said to be a means for organisms to achieve their most complete ideals. Changes in organisms, such as cell division, directly cause changes in life. Every psychological system must have a physical system as its tool of expression; the mind must use the nervous system as its engine. Therefore, matter is indispensable, and it cannot be ignored or denied.</p>
<p>However, matter is only an externality, not a substance. Things cannot arise from nothing, and the mind cannot be born suddenly. Therefore, materialists who exclusively recognize non-mental matter as the ultimate reality and explain the mind as a byproduct of matter have a one-sided view, just like subjective idealism.</p>
<p>In fact, mind and matter are originally one. There is no mere mind or mere matter in the universe, only individuals in whom mind and matter are united. This unity is neither a pure unity without distinction, nor a combination of two things, but a unity of differentiated identity. We know that an individual is a whole that contains many different parts and qualities. When we see it fragmentarily from its parts, we see it as matter; when we see it completely from the individuality of the whole, we see it as spirit. The mind can be said to be the expression and self-awareness of this holistic spirit. The relationship between parts is an external, mechanical, and causal relationship. Therefore, Bosanquet says that a material system is a causal system. The relationship of the whole identity is an internal, organic, and logical relationship. Therefore, Bosanquet says that the mind is a logical system. Then the mind can be said to be the inner nature of the individual, and matter can be said to be the external of the individual. However, the inner and outer contain each other, and mind and matter are inseparable; therefore, the inner is the outer, and the mind is matter. If we consider ourselves, from the mind's ability to express itself in space, the mind is the nervous system; from the concentration of the nervous system, with the spirit striving towards unity, the nervous system is the finite mind. Therefore, if we can understand well, it is originally not impossible to say that the mind has a physical character and matter has a psychological character. However, the mind ultimately occupies a dominant position and has the power to transcend matter. The mind can be said to be the substance and meaning of the material system. For example, music is the substance and meaning of the vibrations of material strings and bamboo; when a needle pricks our body, the pain is the substance and meaning of the prick. Meaning is an interpretation of material change. Although it depends on material change, it is not the result of matter alone. The relationship between mind and body is like the relationship between music and strings, and pain and needle pricks. We can say that in one conscious thought the whole is mind, and in one moment of unconsciousness the whole body is matter.</p>

<h3 id="e172">Anecdotes from the Academic World (XII) <a href="#e172" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c172" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">172</a></h3>
<p>— Zhang Qiyun</p>
<p>Regionalism</p>
<p>At the end of the First World War, the Allied Powers largely accepted President Wilson's proposal. On January 8, 1918, Wilson attended both houses of Congress, detailing the war aims, divided into fourteen articles, namely the historically famous Fourteen Points, the fourteenth of which was the organization of the League of Nations. "Its purpose is for countries to mutually guarantee political freedom and territorial integrity, regardless of size, all enjoying equal protection." The various provisions of the Paris Peace Conference, although sometimes taking other considerations into account, were generally based on this principle to determine the territorial allocation of European countries. Therefore, post-World War I Europe was composed of many nation-states, many of which were small and sparsely populated. At that time, the emphasis was on national rights rather than regional interests. Looking back at Europe from 1919 to 1939, this experiment of emphasizing small and weak nation-states can be said to have failed. It is a universally recognized fact that small and weak nations have no ability to defend themselves. We do not deny the contributions of small countries to the world, such as the Netherlands and Denmark, which are prominent examples. However, small countries are, after all, small countries, and it is impossible for them to stand on an equal footing with powerful countries such as the United States and the Soviet Union. Based on past experience, in order to enable all nations to be independent and free and have ample opportunities for development, the idea of regionalism emerged with the tide of World War II.</p>
<p>The trend of moving from small to large is one of the new trends in the world. A world government is not something that can be achieved overnight. Economic regions or geographical boundaries, located between nations and the world, can serve as a preliminary step in promoting great unity. Regional organizations and the organization of the United Nations are actually mutually supportive and do not conflict with each other. The United Nations is like the first line of defense, and regional organizations are the second line of defense. If the first line of defense is lost, one can retreat to the second line of defense. Regionalism had already begun to sprout after World War I. At that time, European writers had the idea of a European international society, aimed at eliminating disputes between countries. They observed that the development of the United States, Britain, and the Soviet Union was an inevitable trend. Comparing it to China, China's territory is larger than Europe, and China has long been a unified country. Why can't Europe be? However, the era of the League of Nations was the height of small countries, and such ideas were not valued. After the outbreak of World War II, there were many writings on European federation. Practical politicians also made serious suggestions. In September 1946, Churchill, in a speech in Zurich, Switzerland, called this new structure the United States of Europe, jointly led by Germany and France. He advocated the speedy establishment of a new, disarmed Germany to jointly assume responsibility for leading Europe with France. At present, the relationship between the United States and the Soviet Union is becoming increasingly tense. It is still unknown in what form the international society of Europe will appear. We only see that on one side there is the Communist International of Eastern Europe, and on the other side there is the Marshall Plan of Western Europe, with strict barriers and mutual hostility. But from a distance, isn't it an important step towards a European federation? Regionalism also has some that have already been realized, such as the Arab League, which is a good example. The alliance is a new combination of Middle Eastern Islamic countries (including Egypt, Syria, Lebanon, Arabia, Iraq, Palestine, Transjordan, etc.) and has become a diplomatic unit in international politics. According to the Middle East region, the oil fields and strategic relations are the places where the forces of the United States, Britain, and the Soviet Union come into contact. If the Islamic countries can truly implement mutual assistance and unanimously resist foreign countries, they may become a stabilizing factor. Regional organizations are part of the world security system. If they can focus on protecting the territory and the people, producing and building, it is hoped that the sources of chaos in various regions of the world can be eliminated.</p>
<h3 id="e173">Explanation of Lao Tzu's "Gate of All Marvels" and "Gate of the Mysterious Female" <a href="#e173" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c173" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">173</a></h3>
<p>— Yan Qun</p>
<p>Lao Tzu says in Chapter One: "The Tao that can be told is not the eternal Tao. The name that can be named is not the eternal name. Nameless, the origin of heaven and earth; named, the mother of all things. Therefore, constantly without desire, to observe its subtleties; constantly with desire, to observe its boundaries. These two are the same, but diverge in name. The same is called profound; profound and profound, the gate of all subtleties." In Chapter Six, he says: "The valley spirit never dies, is called the mysterious female. The gate of the mysterious female is the root of heaven and earth." This can be called the "Gate of All Marvels," the "Gate of the Mysterious Female," which is where Lao Tzu speaks of the "Tao." Legalists rarely understand this for certain and often get a glimpse of its secrets. Regardless of my own ignorance, I will explain it as follows, to be scrutinized by scholars.</p>
<p>"Can be told" means can be spoken. "Eternal" means "independent," "unchanging," and "unerring"; in modern terms, "independent" means absolute, "unchanging" means immutable, and "unerring" means without error. "Eternal Tao" possesses these three virtues, so it is the Tao of all Tao (i.e., the Tao scattered among all things), which is also the true source of all Tao. The many Tao are "not the eternal Tao." "Not the eternal Tao" is partial, while "Eternal Tao" is complete. What can be spoken is "not the eternal Tao," because it can be thought about. Thinking is the act of comparison. The act of thinking arises from comparing one partial Tao with another. "Eternal Tao" is the completeness of Tao, beyond which there is no Tao, that is, everything is in everything else, so what else can it be compared with? Must it compare with itself? Comparing with itself is not comparison. Since there is nothing to compare, it cannot be thought about; what cannot be thought about cannot be spoken, because speaking is the manifestation of thought in words. "Can be named" means can be given a name. The name that can be given a name is "not the eternal name," therefore it is said, "The name that can be named is not the eternal name." Because "Eternal Name" must be correct, why? Because "name" is used to point; pointing is pointing to something, and not pointing to something else. If pointing and not pointing exist, there must be a distinction between one and the other. If "Eternal" is everything in everything else, there can be no distinction between one and the other, so there is nothing to point to, and there is no use for "name"; therefore, to say "name" and call it "Eternal" is redundant. "Origin of heaven and earth" means before the creation of the universe. Before the creation of the universe, everything was "mixed into one," with no use for names, therefore it is said, "Nameless, the origin of heaven and earth." The unified body of the Tao was divided, and then all things were born; once they are called "many," they need to be distinguished and pointed out, otherwise, they would all be merged back into one, therefore it is said, "Named, the mother of all things."</p>
<p>"Without desire" means without prayer; "subtleties" is tiny and subtle. What is tiny and subtle cannot be perceived by the senses, it is the Tao beyond form. "With desire" means with prayer. "Boundaries" sounds similar to "distinct" and "clear," and may be a variant of "clear" (Chapter 14 says, "Its upper part is not clear, its lower part is not obscure"). "Clear" means to clarify, clarity means material things or events below form; because the boundaries between each other are clear only when there is division, and division arises from prayer. Without prayer, one can confirm the subtle Tao beyond form, because it "circulates everywhere without error," encompassing everything without exception. With prayer, one can see the clear boundaries of things below form, what is prayed for here must not be prayed for there; therefore it is said, "Therefore, constantly without desire, to observe its subtleties; constantly with desire, to observe its boundaries." "These two" refers to "without desire" and "with desire"; "These two are the same" means "without desire" and "with desire" both belong to this unified body of the Tao: without prayer, one is without prayer within this body of the Tao; with prayer, one is with prayer within this body of the Tao. The body of the Tao is one and only one, so they are "the same." "But diverge in name" means that this body of the Tao is called "without desire," "with desire," "nameless," "named," because of the presence or absence of prayer and division. "Without" and "with" are different names, but in reality, they are the same body of the Tao. "The same" is the "Tao" above form, "the different" is the "tool" below form: (i.e., so-called "things and events") "Tools" are many and "Tao" is one, "Tools" are complex and "Tao" is simple, "Tools" are scattered and "Tao" is total. The reason why "Tao" is one, simple, and total is because of its profundity; the reason why "Tools" are many, complex, and scattered is because of their detail. "Profound" means hanging, "hanging" means suspended, not limited to form. Only "Tao" can be "profound," and only "profound" is "the same," because it can be one, simple, and total. "Tools" are many, complex, and scattered. One "Tao" can encompass many "Tools," so "Tools" are different and "Tao" is the same. However, this "Tao" encompasses some and not others, this is the many Tao scattered among all things, the so-called "not the eternal Tao." "Not the eternal Tao" is called "profound" because it can encompass many "Tools." However, there are still degrees of profundity, so there is "profound" above "profound," to the point that it reaches its limit. Then the many profundities all return to the same, therefore it is called "the gate of all subtleties." "Subtleties" means tiny and subtle, tiny and subtle means "profound," the Tao above form; "all subtleties" means all of these, the so-called "not the eternal Tao." "Gate" is "eternal Tao," "eternal Tao" encompasses all "not the eternal Tao" and is what they all point to, therefore it is called "gate."</p>
<p>"Valley" means emptiness, "spirit" means endlessly responsive, "never dies" means inexhaustible. These three virtues are encompassed by the "mysterious female," therefore it is said, "is called the mysterious female." "Mysterious" means suspended, "female" means empty; only the suspended and empty can be a valley, can be spiritual, can never die, only "Tao" is sufficient for this. However, the Tao scattered among all things, the so-called "not the eternal Tao," also possesses these three virtues; for example, the Tao of gravity does not depend (add explanation, same below) on any one falling object, is it not empty? It encompasses all falling events, is it not inexhaustible? Its encompassing of falling events does not fail, without error (i.e., without exception), is it not unyielding? However, this Tao's response to things ends with falling events, other events cannot reach it, so it is finite; it does not depend on any one falling object, but is limited to all falling events, so it is dependent; regarding all falling events it does not fail without error, but other events are not like this, so it is unyielding. It can be seen that the Tao scattered among all things, the so-called "not the eternal Tao," has not yet reached the full extent of the "mysterious female's" abilities. What fully reaches the extent of the "mysterious female's" abilities is only the Tao of the many Tao, the so-called "eternal Tao." "Eternal Tao" is what "not the eternal Tao" points to, therefore it is called "the gate of the mysterious female; "the gate of the mysterious female" means: Great Profundity is what all profundities come from. Therefore it is said, "Eternal Tao" is Great Profundity, it is the source of all subtleties and profundities, this is called "the root of heaven and earth."</p>

<h3 id="e174">Advantages and Disadvantages <a href="#e174" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c174" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">174</a></h3>
<p>— Ji Mo</p>
<p>I do not intend to play with the mysterious theory that "advantages are disadvantages, and disadvantages are advantages," or the game of words; however, nothing in the world is entirely advantageous or entirely disadvantageous.</p>
<p>For example, gambling is often criticized by righteous gentlemen, who say that it indulges in frivolity and is extremely harmful. However, according to a friend who loves to play "Russian Poker," getting a good hand has good ways to play, and getting a bad hand also has bad ways to play. It seems to train the virtues of "decisiveness" and "calmness."</p>
<p>Also, being punctual can give a good impression and increase work efficiency, but in an extreme example, as recorded in this article about the beginning and end of Yamamoto Fifty-Six's death, he was shot down by Allied aircraft because he was punctual.</p>
<p>Speaking of Yamamoto Fifty-Six, it reminds me that Japan's defeat this time was initially very unfavorable to it, but now it seems that the advantages outweigh the disadvantages. I was listening to singing programs from Tokyo on overseas radio programs. Although I couldn't understand what they were singing, the tone was sonorous and vigorous, which was different from the current popular "decadent music." Although we cannot say for sure what this music symbolizes, Japan, under MacArthur's control, seems to be on the rise.</p>
<p>As for personal views on advantages and disadvantages, they vary from person to person. When everyone is frowning and worrying about the price of rice, one gentleman in the audience alone has a complacent look. Later, after asking around, I learned that this gentleman owns a rice store. The advantages and disadvantages of the world should all be viewed in this way.</p>
<h3 id="e175">Idle Talk about Devout Men and Women <a href="#e175" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c175" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">175</a></h3>
<p>— Nian Hong</p>
<p>Shanghai was originally a complex city, where contradictions could be found everywhere. Even on Nanjing Road, where people are bustling and cars are weaving, there are large companies and hotels, with flourishing businesses and a magnificent scene. However, in contrast, there is also the Baoshan Temple, where many people burn incense and seek divination every day, crowded and unbearable. When it is some Bodhisattva's birthday or memorial day, the scene is even more grand. Devout men and women squeeze in, just like buying household rice during the enemy-puppet period, and they can't see the shadow of the Buddha for a long time. They often have to make do with burning some ingots and candles and kowtowing in front of the door gods and heavenly generals to fulfill their wishes.</p>
<p>In fact, having Baoshan Temple on Nanjing Road is not necessarily a laughing stock for the West, otherwise it may be sealed off because it hinders the appearance of the city and affects international views. Because in recent years, although Catholicism and Christianity have also spread in China, they are ultimately not as numerous and deeply rooted as Buddhist believers. Therefore, temples in the city are "abnormally prosperous," just like there are churches and cathedrals standing in foreign metropolises, symbolizing the beauty of religious architecture. Not only that, it also shows the traditional religious freedom of the ancient Eastern country - one of the most free "freedoms" for Chinese people.</p>
<p>Not only is Baoshan Temple doing well, but the New City God Temple, the Old City God Temple, Jing'an Temple, Qingliang Temple, and all the large and small temples, including whatever Guans and whatever Palaces, all seem to have good incomes and thriving incense. In a year when the economy is unstable and the market is not prosperous, it is often heard around the New Year's Eve that some large companies have insufficient turnover, some large factories have suspended operations, and some large stores have closed down. But there has never been news that some temple has been unable to make ends meet due to huge expenses. If anything, I only remember that not long ago, there were two monks who had a lawsuit over the temple property they were in charge of. From this, we can infer that it is better for our minority ethnic capitalist families who are desperately supporting some small-scale light industries with investment to close their doors and rebuild their factories as temples. Judging by the prosperity of the Bodhisattva in front of the racecourse, the profit is 120% guaranteed.</p>
<p>Most people's belief in religion still stems from a selfish point of view. The first type is like Jiangyang bandits, who often make vows to the Bodhisattva before preparing to commit a crime. Speculators pray silently, saying that if the Bodhisattva blesses their speculation to succeed, they will definitely rebuild the statue with gold. In such cases, to put it harshly, they simply treat the clay and wooden statues of gods as objects to share the loot. It is said that Buddhist doctrine prohibits the use of ill-gotten wealth, but the colorful gold and incense candles on many gods and Bodhisattvas mostly carry a bloody smell. The second type is when people have no way out and can't go to heaven or enter the earth, then they think of the Bodhisattva and God. For example, people who are disheartened with all worldly affairs often chant scriptures and recite Buddha's name to spend the rest of their lives. Westerners shouting God in times of crisis and Chinese people chanting Guanshiyin in times of crisis can be said to come from the same mentality. But whether they are believers of the first or second type, they are simply gamblers who are betting their lives and pitiful bugs who have no way out. The so-called "devout men and women" are just like that.</p>
<p>From this point of view, it is easy to imagine the outline and content of this society when looking at the devout men and women crowded inside and outside the temples.</p>
<h3 id="e176">Lamp Wick <a href="#e176" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c176" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">176</a></h3>
<p>— Hu Yahui</p>
<p>While reading an old book under the lamp, I suddenly found a thin white lamp wick.</p>
<p>I can't remember why this lamp wick was stuck in the book. The old book was brought from the countryside. I suppose it was casually taken from under the lamp when people still used rapeseed oil lamps in the countryside and used as a bookmark? -- This lamp wick has been around for many years.</p>
<p>Looking closely at the lamp wick, it is still thin, long, and white as ever, without any damage. It must be the lamp wick's good fortune to be kept in a book, retaining its original appearance.</p>
<p>Rapeseed oil lamps have long been discarded, and lamp wicks are also about to disappear. Being able to accidentally find it in a book today is like meeting an old friend, and I feel very close. It was my good companion for many years, and under its light, I finished reading many books and gained many inspirations.</p>
<p>But now that kerosene lamps and electric lights are used, it is no longer valued. With the renewal of the times, it has fallen behind. Therefore, I feel sad for it. It also burned itself to give off light, shining on every corner and shining on people's eyes; even now it can still give off light, and in the darkness, it is still people's savior. Have people forgotten it? Or has it failed people? I am angry and indignant for it! I plead for it!</p>
<p>Writing this, I remember a poem about lamp wicks made by someone. I will write it down now as the ending of this short article: "Endowed with a light and gentle nature, holding itself white like autumn frost, but able to make the world bright, going into fire and boiling water is no obstacle." (Written to commemorate Teacher Xu)</p>
<h3 id="e177">Casual Talk About Rockets <a href="#e177" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c177" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">177</a></h3>
<p>— Mao Yi</p>
<p>Rockets are called "child prodigies" in this war. If this were really the case, then George Bernard Shaw would only be considered a budding writer, and Albert Einstein would be just a promising young scientist. We do not deny the importance of rocket weapons; we also do not doubt that future rockets will carry humans to any corner of the Earth, or even to another planet. However, we find it difficult to silently acknowledge that rockets are the "child prodigies" nurtured by 20th-century science. This is because the British were already using rocket weapons in the Napoleonic Wars of the early 19th century.</p>
<p>The accuracy of rockets has never been well established. Therefore, when someone attached special equipment to the tail nozzle of rockets two years ago, causing them to rotate and improve accuracy, scientists unanimously praised it as an "unprecedented invention." Indeed, rotating rockets are a significant improvement. But is this an unprecedented innovation? No, we should not forget that rotating rockets were already exerting their power in the Mexican War a hundred years ago.</p>
<p>In 1805, when Napoleon dominated Europe and wanted to turn his attention to invading Britain, Sir William Congreve's war rockets shattered his dreams. These rockets destroyed Boulogne near Paris in 1806, and a year later, destroyed Copenhagen, the capital of Denmark, preventing Napoleon from crossing the Strait due to the need to defend his rear. Later, rockets were also used by the British army to attack the French fleet: in Koge, Danzig, and the Battle of Leipzig, rockets also demonstrated their power.</p>
<p>When the War of 1812 broke out between Britain and the United States, there was a rocket brigade in the British army, which defeated the Maryland militia in Bladensburg, allowing them to directly attack Washington City. In the battle for Fort McHenry, the British also used rockets to gain an advantage.</p>
<p>However, Congreve's rockets were still immature weapons. They were unsafe and completely undirected. At the time, each rocket was tied to a fifteen-foot pole to direct it in an approximate correct direction. They had advantages, but also many limitations. Many countries were engaged in improving rockets. In 1846, William Hale, an American, invented the first rotating rocket, solving the problem of accuracy. He used the heat generated by the rocket itself to obliquely spray onto the three curved wings at the tail, causing the rocket to rotate in flight. Rotating rockets had a much higher hit rate than early rockets.</p>
<p>After official testing by the U.S. military, Hale's rockets began to be manufactured at the Washington Arsenal. At that time, there were two sizes, one with a diameter the same as the current U.S. military's Bazooka recoilless rifle; the larger one was one inch larger in diameter and had a range of 2,200 yards. To use this new weapon, the United States organized a rocket corps. They soon participated in the Mexican War. One group landed in Veracruz, and another helped attack Chapultepec Castle near the capital of Mexico. Due to the smooth military progress, the rocket corps' reputation grew. Unfortunately, military authorities were only enthusiastic about celebrating victories and forgot to record the effectiveness of the rockets themselves.</p>
<p>Therefore, we say that rockets are not a new invention, and rotating rockets are not a new gadget either. Tracing back even further, William Congreve's rockets were actually imitating the Indians. In the Anglo-Indian wars of the late 18th century, the Indian army used rockets more than once to counterattack the British army. This news reached London, and the success of the Indian rocket corps of the Prince of Mysore stimulated Congreve, making him a famous arms dealer in the early 19th century. And who can say for sure that rockets were born in India two centuries ago? Perhaps it has an even longer history! Therefore, I do not admit that rockets are a new invention of the 20th century, although modern rockets are more ingenious, refined, and effective than ancient ones.</p>

<p>Chapter 12: A Chance Encounter (92)</p>
<p>Qiwan saw that he spoke very calmly and elegantly. In this boring and depressing situation, being able to have such a good guest was enough to break the silence. So, the two of them leaned against the railing and discussed their experiences on stage and screen, enjoying the conversation more and more. They talked for several hours before returning to the house. Qiwan felt that this man was romantic and suave, even better than Zhu Zhai. For a person who is extremely bored, the sudden arrival of a stimulating friend who relieves their depression and comforts them with words will leave a lasting impression on their mind. Qiwan had been depressed and listless for days, but today's conversation with Daoyun rekindled the embers in her heart, making her feel that a person cannot be confined to one place in society but must travel around and seek their own survival. This time, she had been so angry that she tried to commit suicide by swallowing gold. If she had died then, society might not have sympathized with her, and might even have added negative criticism to her. Now that she thought about it, this action was too reckless and ignorant. Just now, she heard Daoyun talk about the situation in the Shanghai theater world. If she was willing to perform in Shanghai, she might be able to make a name for herself. Why should she stay in Beijing all the time? Changing the environment would also make her feel mentally happy. Qiwan thought about this and wanted to go to Daoyun's ward to discuss it in detail, but since they had just met today, it seemed inappropriate to go to his ward at night. At the same time, she thought that Daoyun's words and actions were somewhat like Zhu Zhai, and talking to him was interesting. He had been working in the film industry for many years and had extensive experience, and discussing art with him would also be beneficial to her. That night, Qiwan lay in bed, tossing and turning, thinking for a while, and then fell asleep. When she woke up early the next morning, she soon heard a light knock on the door outside. Qiwan said "Please come in" from inside the room, and Daoyun pushed the door open in response. She saw that he had taken off the white hospital gown that the hospital had given him and put on a very beautiful Western suit, which made him look even more handsome and suave. As soon as he entered the door, he bowed to Qiwan and said with a slight smile, "So Miss Gu is already up. I came to the hospital early this morning, and when I didn't see Miss Gu come out, I thought you were not feeling well, so I came to visit you." Qiwan smiled and said, "I'm not feeling unwell, but I didn't sleep well last night, so I woke up late today." Daoyun said, "I also went to sleep very late yesterday." As he said this, he looked at Qiwan, and Qiwan felt that his words seemed to imply something, and her face could not help but blush slightly. She really wanted to tell him that she had thought about going to his room to talk last night, but it was just inconvenient to say so.</p>
<h3 id="e179">Xia Yu Is Not a Worm Anymore <a href="#e179" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c179" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">179</a></h3>
<p>— Sun He</p>
<p>Professor Gu Jiegang is an authority on ancient Chinese history. Many of his works contain surprising arguments. He used a skeptical eye to look at all the classics, and more than twenty years ago issued the conclusion that "Wan (夏) is a worm."</p>
<p>The academic community once caused many people to be surprised. Some people questioned the skepticism, and some people thought that Mr. Gu's statement was absurd and made a stern satire. Lu Xun was one of them, which once stimulated Mr. Gu and made him furious. He wrote a letter to Lu Xun, who was teaching at Sun Yat-sen University, asking him not to leave Guangzhou, because he thought it was a great insult and was waiting for him to file a lawsuit and open the trial. In the end, Mr. Lu Xun did not obey and wait, but just returned a satire and left. Mr. Gu did not proceed with the lawsuit, otherwise, it would have been a good story in the history of academic affairs to go to court for academic differences.</p>
<p>Ten years after Lu Xun's death (the 34th year of the Republic of China), we found the following paragraph in the editorial of the special issue of ancient history of the Literature and History magazine edited by Mr. Gu Yigang in Chongqing—</p>
<p>Our ancient history felt that the literature of the Xia and Yin dynasties was insufficient in the time of Confucius. By the time of Confucius, even the literature of the Western Zhou dynasty was felt to be insufficient. Therefore, if we want to study the historical facts of ancient times, we cannot rely solely on a few books. We can only devote ourselves to archaeology and work hard to excavate relics underground, just like the British people's study of ancient Egyptian history. Relics are certainly also fragmented, but they are always physical objects of that time and are direct materials, unlike ancient books, which have undergone many transcriptions and re-editions and have many later trivial problems. Many relics have been discovered in the past forty years. As long as we are patient and carefully explore the relics themselves, we may be able to build a system with our imagination. (Omission in the middle) However, judging from the relics we have already excavated, we can only explore the history of the Yin and Shang dynasties. We still feel very confused about the Xia kingdom. Although the existence of Xia is undoubtedly unquestionable, the history of Xia is not easy to start. Many steel tools have been unearthed, but none of them are from Xia. Many ancient characters have been discovered, but none of them were written by the Xia people. Since there is no bronze ware, are they still stuck in the Neolithic Age? Since there is no Xia writing, is there no writing at that time, or has it not yet been discovered? When we mention these questions, we are really very confused. There is insufficient literature and no relics exist, so we cannot speculate out of thin air. Therefore, as of now, our ancient history can only be written from the Yin and Shang dynasties. The historical events before the Shang dynasty still need to be searched for by archaeologists who continue to work hard.</p>
<p>Although Mr. Gu used Confucius's saying in the Analects, "I can speak of the Xia ritual, but the state of Qi is not enough to prove it," to show that the "one worm" theory was not too absurd, he still had some regrets about his "early work," and after all, he denied the past practice of studying only old papers without relying on physical objects. Moreover, he affirmed that "the existence of Xia is already undoubtedly unquestionable" and repeatedly admitted his "ignorance" of Xia history, without any intention of concealing his mistakes. This progressive spirit in scholarship is worthy of special mention. Mr. Gu would probably laugh at himself for the lawsuit he wanted to file back then.</p>
<h3 id="e180">A Money-Worshipping Society <a href="#e180" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c180" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">180</a></h3>
<p>— Yun Gong</p>
<p>In the countless European and American novels that I have read, one that I read more than a decade ago has left a particularly deep impression on me. The general idea is that a wealthy man, Mr. A, in order to test the fickleness of the world, deliberately put on a tattered cloak and attended a certain banquet. The guests at the meeting cast contemptuous glances at him and subjected him to ridicule. However, he slowly took off his cloak, revealing that the clothes underneath were brand new and the accessories he was wearing were worth the entire city. As a result, everyone rushed to flatter him, reversing their original "long faces."</p>
<p>This novel is naturally intended to satirize the world, and I am afraid that there may not be such a real event. However, the detestable aspect of a money-worshipping society lies in this, and the lovely aspect also lies in this.</p>
<p>In small ways, as long as your clothes are neatly pressed and your leather shoes are shiny, you will be respected and welcomed everywhere, whether you are riding the streetcar or buying things. The ticket seller will never glare at you and push you, saying, "Where's the ticket?" He will definitely say, "Sir, do you have a ticket?"</p>
<p>A friend, Mr. So-and-so, even talked to me about a small incident of buying pepper. It turned out that my friend suddenly had a whim to eat noodles one day. After the noodles were cooked, he suddenly wanted to eat pepper, so he strolled to a pharmacy at the corner of the street and asked the shop assistant to buy 5,000 yuan of pepper. The shop assistant glanced at his unkempt clothes and said coldly, "Buy from 10,000 yuan!" As a result, Mr. So-and-so, wearing a one-carat diamond ring, waved 5,000 yuan in banknotes at him and refused to buy it out of anger.</p>
<p>It is said that the Cubans in South America regard clothes as their first life, and diet comes second. A Cuban with a snow-white shirt and shiny hair may not have a full stomach. In this money-worshipping society, Cubans seem to be something that cannot be done but can be done.</p>
<h3 id="e181">Connected Words <a href="#e181" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c181" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">181</a></h3>
<p>— Chen Xuexueyuan</p>
<p>Modern scholars attach great importance to folk literature, and often gain significant harvests from "unadorned" texts. Yesterday, I read Shen Bao (25) again and got a wonderful couplet, which has more research value than General Li's masterpiece in Hong Kong (24). The spring couplet of the recluse in Xi'an is "Our housing is too expensive," "and the rent is going to increase fourteen times," and the plaque is the three characters "Cannot afford to live," which is also a kind of complaining. I think the viewers may think it is a vulgar saying, and even if they sympathize with his "injustice," they will definitely laugh at the production of this couplet.</p>
<p>However, this kind of couplet can indeed represent a part of "folk literature" and can provide a reference for Chinese and Western literary organizations.</p>
<p>The first thing to pay attention to is that the number of words in these two sentences is the same, and they are posted on both sides, with a neat and parallel shape, which already has the basic conditions of a couplet. The second thing to note is that the words in his upper and lower sentences are not opposite at all, and they do not constitute the main condition (parallel sentences) of a couplet, but he uses another unnecessary condition (rhyme) as the element of completing the weaving of the couplet. This is naturally a mistake. A couplet is a kind of "parallel sentence," not "rhyme," and "rhyme" cannot be used as a substitute for "parallelism," so the rhyme between "expensive (貴)" and "times (倍)" is meaningless, needless to say. But in his view, in addition to "the number of words being equal," "the sound and rhyme are also coordinated," so "rhyme" is also considered to be an additional element of composition, and he is satisfied.</p>
<p>Although it is unreasonable to use "rhyme" instead of "parallelism," it cannot be "laughed off," and it must be admitted that there is a reason for this kind of unparallel couplet. Now let's analyze it from the perspectives of "folk" and "Western translation":</p>
<p>Novels, imposters, and random play scripts are all popular works and public appreciations. There is a so-called "reading couplets" in random plays, that is, non-opposite couplets, which often use "rhyme" instead of "parallelism," such as the evil village schoolmaster Ye Tianli reading the first sentence: "Cheng Guan is like a bird in a cage," Wu Tianqiu reads the second sentence "Let him insert his wings and it is difficult to escape"; such as Qionglin Banquet Nao Fu Ge Dengyun reads the first sentence "Ge Hu will go this time and do not regret it," Ge Hu answers the second sentence "Be sure to see blood with a steel knife." This is called "going off stage couplet," which is read when people on the stage are about to go off stage to end the performance. (The above is read by two people, if there is only one person on the stage, he can also read two sentences by himself. It can also be used in the middle stage and on stage, which will not be listed here.) And in novels, at the end of a stage, such as "Treading through iron shoes without finding it," "It's all effortless to get it," are all of this kind. The upper and lower sentences do not "parallel" but rhyme, and that is considered a "couplet." There are also some that "parallel" and also "rhyme," such as "Planning to capture the jade rabbit in the moon," "Planning to capture the golden island in the day"; such as "Treading through the sky and flying a colorful phoenix," "Suddenly opening the golden lock and walking a dragon" which is both opposed and the two sentences have the same meaning, which is "clapping hands," which is also a lower grade in parallel sentences. However, in the manufacturing technology of the people, parallelism is actually more difficult than rhyme. Being able to parallel is also a rough way of paralleling. If you can't parallel, use "rhyme" to make it up. If even the "plaque" can't be done well, then just having the same number of words is considered good, such as "Full of heart and abdomen," "Everything is unsaid," also called "couplet." From this, the following conclusions can be obtained:</p>
<p>(1) A mood, using words to express to the public, is best to post it out in the form of a couplet, which is based on natural requirements. The square single-syllable Chinese language is a very readily available good condition.</p>
<p>(2) The upper and lower sentences have the same number of words, and they are posted out on the left and right, then they have the qualification of a couplet.</p>
<p>(3) It is best if the whole body can be matched into a parallel sentence. If it is really not parallel, then use "rhyme" instead of "parallelism," which is considered to be an extra layer of production effort.</p>
<p>Secondly, let's talk about Western translation. There are many Chinese works translated into Western languages. Because the square single-syllable characters are incompatible with the syllabic spelling characters of the couplet, the work of translation is not only difficult, but also some important places are fundamentally impossible. The most obvious is the parallel sentence, such as Liao Zhai Zhi Yi's</p>
<p>With flowers and wine, spring is always here,</p>
<p>Without moon and lamp, the moon is bright by itself.</p>
<p>What a scene it is to translate such groups of paired upper and lower sentences into Western words of unequal length is not difficult to predict. But the translator seems to have a way. The English translation of these two sentences in Liao Zhai is:</p>
<p>With wine and flowers we chase the hours,</p>
<p>In one eternal Spring;</p>
<p>No moon no light to cheer the night,</p>
<p>Thyself that ray must bring．</p>
<p>It becomes a very good short poem, full of "rhyme," the sentence is "rhyming," Jian is "alliteration," melodious and easy to read. Although the rhyme is full, it is impossible to match it into a parallel sentence. Although it is not a parallel sentence, the upper and lower sentences are divided into four lines of different lengths, which are roughly even, and that's all that can be done. Its painstaking efforts are similar to those of our people who use "rhyme" instead of "parallelism," which can be said to be the same disease and sympathy. Our people use "rhyme" instead of "parallelism" because people's writing level is not enough, or they have not used the mind of parallel sentences at all. Westerners use "rhyme" instead of "parallelism" because their words have no possibility of parallelism at all. What they call Couplet only needs two sentences (or words) whose meanings and forms seem to become a "pair," but they can never have a couplet, and their Couplet cannot be divided or suspended, such as the style of Chinese door couplets and cooperative posts.</p>

<p>A wife who is not virtuous causes trouble for her husband. Separating and going their separate ways.</p>
<p>Xu Yongjian: When I was ten years old, I was introduced to marry a woman surnamed Zhang from the same village as a child bride. We got married in the 22nd year of the Republic of China. At first, we were still harmonious, but later, due to family difficulties, I was often insulted by Zhang. Later, I came to Shanghai for employment and still sent money back home every month. Unexpectedly, Zhang took advantage of a small amount of money to be unable to make a living, so she spent it arbitrarily and even attempted to abscond. I was forced to discuss with her parents and divorced in the 28th year. All the divorce procedures were handled by my maternal grandmother, Zhao. Zhang's parents issued a receipt and were willing to pay one hundred and ten yuan to settle the matter. Now there are legal questions, please give me an answer: (1) Is the letter of divorce signed by the maternal grandmother on behalf of her valid in law? (2) How to handle the legal procedures? (3) The receipt issued by Zhang has been lost. How can it be remedied? (4) If I marry another woman, does the other party have the right to interfere? (5) If there is a lawsuit between the parties, can letters be used as evidence for prosecution? (6) If Zhang remarries and raises children, can she testify?</p>
<p>[Lawyer Fu Kuang's answer] (1) Zhao's signature on behalf of the divorce agreement is valid if she is authorized to do so. (2) The two parties should invite more than three witnesses to re-establish a divorce agreement. (3) The loss of the receipt only needs to be proven in fact, and there will be no problem. (4) The divorce procedure is complete and marrying another person is not restricted. (5) The letter is only sufficient to prove that there is such a fact and is irrelevant to the case. (6) The adulterous spouse has already remarried and has ten daughters and is no longer involved.</p>

<p>It is hereby approved that the Social Service Section of the Editorial Department of Shen Bao transferred to us a letter from your office to the editor of the newspaper on February 19 of this year regarding inquiries about postal exchange rates. In order to serve and facilitate the public, the post office has been reducing the exchange rate as much as possible. Recently, the exchange rates of various banks have generally been high, especially for remittances to Fujian and Guangdong. The post office has had to refer to the bank rates to charge exchange fees to avoid difficulties in payment. However, the exchange rates in various places change at any time. The letter stated: "The post office has raised the exchange rate for remittances to various places in South China (Fujian and Guangdong) so high, some places as high as 18 percent." I plan to indicate the date of payment, the amount of remittance, the bill number, the name of the issuing bureau, and the name of the paying bureau to the bureau for investigation. If there is any overcharge of exchange fees, the overcharged exchange fees will be refunded in full, and the responsible personnel will be punished. As for the family funds and children's education expenses of service personnel of public and private institutions, according to the regulations of the Joint Head Office of the Four Banks of China, only this bureau and other branches of the bureau in various places can handle them, and post offices in various places do not handle them. A corresponding letter is replied, and I hope you will check it. To Mr. Shizhou Postal Reserve Gold Exchange Bureau</p>
