<h3>行憲政院首次集議施政方針卽提立院　翁文灝勉僚屬共重責</h3>

<p>〔本報南京一日電〕今日政院舉行首次政務會議時，翁院長勗勉僚屬，共體時艱，同負重責，庶克轉危爲安，奠定憲政規模，翁院長指出目前責任乃行憲與戡亂，全國人心及世界友邦，對我國政府皆抱有絕大期望，希望均能一德一心，共同負此重大責任，養成一種積極前進的風氣，爲整個國家，開闢更爲光明的前途。惟以共黨不顧國家利益，肆行破壞與殘殺，以致民不聊生，成爲空前浩刧。今後吾人必須以國民的食衣住行爲日標，認眞策劃，認眞執行，方能挽救目前艱苦，繼謂美國贈物貸款助我復興，必須深自策勉，與美國處理援華物資人員，開誠商洽，發揮自助自立精神，以報償友邦輔助匡襄的好意。最後翁氏表示早日商訂施政方針，俾提出立院報吿，並希望靑年黨同人早日就職，民社黨仍能參加政府合作。</p>
<p>〔中央社南京一日電〕行政院先後聘定蔣勻田，彭學沛爲行政院顧問。又今後行政院每週二照例舉行之政務會議，因與立法院例會所訂時間衝突，決定改於每星期三爲例會日期。</p>
<h3>立院第六次會議通過　設美援特種委會　清查豪門資本交財金委會研究辦法　組織法三條條文修正</h3>
<p>〔本報南京一日電〕第一屆立法院第一會勘第六次會議，一日晨九時半舉行，秘書長張肇元報吿孫院長因公外出缺席，請出席委員互推一人祖任主席，當由會衆扯舉程天放出任，首通過上次會議紀錄，繼由張秘書長報吿二日將舉行各委員會召集委員聯席會議，討論該院「自己的事」，謝絕記者旁聽後，即依議事日程規定順序進行討論事項。</p>
<p>第一案爲程天放，陳顧遠，鄭彥棻報吿整理立法院組織法第三，四，五條條文案，陳顧遠說明後，經衆略作文字討論，仍依原案通過（見另條）。第二案爲郝耀東等提議「請確定本屆閉會日期，並計劃在閉會前應完成重要工作案」。第三案爲陳明仙等提議「請提高本院本次會期工作效率案」，討論結果，通過尹述賢之建議，以該兩案並不能作成法律，不必有所決議，應交有關委員會注意，並請發言委員節約會議時間。</p>
<p>第四案爲特種審查委員會建議設置程序委員會，淸查豪門資本特種委員會及美援特種委員會案，特種審查委員會關於程序委員會之報吿爲：「設程序委員會，但不必於組織法中規定，此項委員會之委員，可由常設之委員會各推委員一人任之，遇有程序問題發生，隨時召開會議」。經提議人張匯文說明後，即爲會衆接受，無異議通過。至淸查豪門資本特委會之設置，則於提議人馮均璉說明後，遭遇多數委員反對，僉認豪門資本確應淸查，結算，消滅，防止，然設委員會則可能以程序周折害及立法，實無必要，最後以二九九人之贊同（在塲四一〇人），通過郭登敖之建議，特委會不必設立，而將有關處置豪門資本事宜交財政·金融委員會研究辦法，並起草有關法律條例，至十二時散會。</p>
<p>午後三時半續會，仍由程天放主席，繼續討論第四案之設置美援特種委會問題，提議人丘漢平說明該特委會設立之必要後，正反兩面力起辯論，賴璉·潘朝英·劉振東·許蟠雲·潘衍興·潘廉方等爲贊成設立者，以美援對目前國內局勢非常重要，財政金融將賴以穩定，生產建設賴以發展，且美援爲債務，加重人民負祖，應由議會加以過問，立院允宜專設委會，負責注意研究。倪玉潔·陶鎔·余拯等則以美援運用之執行在行政院，監督在監察院，立院應信任政府，使其能放手作事，最後表決以一六〇人（在塲三〇一人）之贊成，通過設置美援特委會，繼討論其組織，決定由各委員自由參加。</p>

<h3>我對日立場堅定　重視美對賠償問題態度</h3>
<p>〔本報南京一日電〕邇來各地反對美國扶植日本之意見甚多，立院一日會議中亦有李雲良以航業爲重心之有關提案。據記者獲悉政府對此等民意之表現，已予注意。另某關係方面人士，並曾於一日與記者談此一問題。略稱：關於美國對於日本賠償問題所採政策，我政府夙極重視。外部曾就美國歷次所遣代表，擬提之計劃，迭次訓令我出席遠東委會代表顧維鈞大使，嚴密注意。然迄今美國並未有何傾向於更改原經通過賠償原則之行動。我蔣總統於上月廿日就任典禮致詞中，復明白宣稱，我國對日雖採取寬大政策，不作過分要求。然以我國歷八年抗戰，飽受侵略，在決定對日和平條款時，仍不能不要求其他盟國承認我國在和會中應有一種特殊地位。我國立塲之堅定，固不待再事多言。</p>

<h3>修正貿易管理辦法的要點</h3>
<p>結匯證明書的使用辦法公佈之後，對於進出口貿易的管理辦法，我們曾提出若干疑點，尤其是限額分配問題，出口商兼營的進口的外匯問題，以及自備外匯的辦貨進口問題，均認爲有車予考慮與調整的必要。日來改善貿易管制這一點；聞已引起各方深切的注意，輸管會正在商討具體辦法，據說即日可望　現。我們對於此項修正辦法，願再　陳所見，藉供參考。</p>
<p>第一，所傳修正辦法，對於限額制這一點，聞仍擬予以維持；惟限額與分配標準，究竟如何厘正，尙未見透露。除所限　額，自應按照情形，隨時公佈，未可作硬性規定外，渦去限　太緊，與各地分配未盡合理，却是衆所周知的事實。此後對　進口外滙，旣責由進口商向出口商自行洽購，央行不再供給，則在原則上，自可儘量鼓勵出口，儘量吸收僑滙興白備外滙，以資供給，不必再將是項限額，過於抽緊，以緩和停工减產與工廠南遷的嚴重情勢。</p>
<p>第二，附表一即生產器材部份，傳將大量或全部開放，准許以自備外匯採辦進口。這原是兩年來中央早有擬議，而爲大家熱望已久的事情，我們自應贊同，尤盼望其早日實現。因爲許多廠家，對於所需要的機器及零件等，因限於進口，無法補充，不得不局部停止，致妨礙了生產的進行，其在港設廠的原因，據說，也因爲所定機器無法進口，與所需器件無法補充，這自然成爲他們所藉口的正當理由。如果生產器材，准許以自備外匯自由進口，不再受現行辦法的限制，則各地廠商的困難，固可藉以解除，而工廠南　的情勢，亦或可賴以緩和。這比經濟部所頒禁止紗錠出口的硬性治標辦法，自然要高明得多了。不過生產器材，也有種種分別：有製造民生日用必需品的，也有屬於比較次要性質的；有可以就地取材，開拓土貨用途的，也有原料不多，必須仰給於外貨的；有許多工業，基礎稍厚，目前需供差可維持的，也有替代品太少，舍洋貨外，無法自給的。爲兩利取重，有效地運用計劃經濟起見，對於所謂生產器材，似也有加以分別和甄選的必要。尤其是所製原料，國產太少，大部份需要外貨接濟時，在這外匯資源顯然有限的今日，應否一視同仁，不加取舍，確乎値得重視。因爲是項器材進口愈多，則日後外洋原料的需要，和所須進口的外匯，勢必連帶地增加，這恐怕不是最理想的辦法吧！</p>
<p>第三，自備外匯，除可以採辦生產器材進口外，其他尙無所聞。我們以爲不論僑匯，或出口外匯，除照結匯證明書辦法使用外，亦應由所有人保留一部份，准其於取得輸入許可證後，自行辦貨入口，以資鼓勵。即自備外匯部份，除准許採辦生產器材外，如果自願辦貨進口，只須事前申請，獲得許可，亦不必加以歧視，致滋疑阻。現在外匯資金如此缺乏，出口事業之擴展又未必能盡如人意，而逃避在國外的國人存款，與流入香港的華僑外匯，又如彼其多，那麽，在無礙於外匯管理與貿易管理的前提之下，一切不妨從寬，以廣招徠，方可使已逃避之資金，回歸國內，從事生產。</p>
<p>有人顧慮到，除輸入生產器材外，同時如准許輸入商品，或將使此項資金紛紛投入消耗品，這也不爲無見。不過輸入的許可制度，旣沒有加以廢止，則消耗品並不能自由進口，准許與否，其權仍操諸輸管會；只須依法審核，伺時加强緝私，此等疑懼，實在並無根據，如果瞻徇情面，於法外濫許進口，或緝私效率過低，無法防止其走私入口，則又顯然不是立法問題了。</p>
<p>總而言之，貿易管理的辦法，必須酌加修正，已爲公認的事實，而爲加緊地推廣輸出，和吸收一切外匯資金起見，新訂的結匯證明辦法，我們亦認爲有再予以補充的必要。</p>
<h3>趙迺卜教授暢論　土地改革二大問題</h3>
<p>制度與技術，乃是土地問題一物的兩面，制度是地權問題，技術是利用問題，制度不改良，技術難求進步，技術不進步，雖制度變更，亦無補於民生之改善。我國自秦漢以來，幾乎每一朝代，在興亡交替之際，都有一套土地政策出現，作爲他們的政治資本；但不幸嘗試的絲果，不曾有圓滿的成功，所有的改革，不是半途而廢，即是根本無法推行。漢董仲舒何武孔光之流，首倡「限田」之議，徒託空言，議而不行。王莽立「王田」之制，用意在改革土地私有制度，但施行不及三年，釀成「姦吏猾民並侵，衆庶久不安生」的現象而完全失敗。魏晋六朝的授田政策，頗有均田與限田之微意，但以戶口之離散難稽，權豪之逼賣綦烈，加以奉行不力，終鮮成效。唐初承世業口分之制，而佐以租庸調法，名義上雖號稱均田，但實際上地權並不平均。宋代採限田法，亦以抵押轉租，法所不禁，實際上超過甚多。王安石的土地政策，旨在扶植自耕農，一方面採用方田均稅法，使大地主不能逃避租稅，另一方面採用靑苗法，予自耕農以金融上的融通，立法未始不良，終以阻撓難行而失敗。元明淸之土地制度極紊亂，兼併之風尤熾，所謂皇田限田永業田及一條鞭之辦法，僅爲一時之治標，實難推行於久遠。綜觀歷代的土地政策，限於制度上的改革，極少技術上的進步，因此地的改革，成了一個制度的循環演變，毫無技術上的新陳代謝作用，而且過去土地改革的動機，以抑富濟貧爲目標，在生產的按術上尙缺乏顯明的意識，故其失敗的原因，即在政治與經濟的脫節。</p>
<p>土地改革的制度問題，就是地權問題。</p>
<p>地權的檢討</p>
<p>屬於分配的范疇。而分配可從兩方面講：一方面是土地本身的分配，另一方面就是農作物的分配。前者討較土地所有權，後者討論田租。關於全國土地分配的情形，有兩種不同的統計：其一指示中國土地集中的程度，並不太高；其二指示中國土地集中的程度，相當嚴重。不過我們要曉得土地分配的集中，有時僅表示財產的集中，未必即表示農業生產經營的集中。換言之，即大地主的存在，未必即大農塲的經營。由於土地財產的集中，就引起了社會分配的嚴重問題；由於土地使用的分散，即產生了經濟生產的嚴重問題。所以我國的土地問題，受了這雙重的壓迫、欲求改革，甚感困難。蓋因土地財產集中而使用分散的緣故，迭成了各種不同的田租制度，大體包括力租物租及錢租之三大類型，這種租佃關係的存在，對於生產效能之影響，或許有不同之見解，但農塲面積之過於細碎，其足以妨碍科學方法的機器生產者毫無疑義。</p>
<p>土地的分配</p>
<p>可分絕對的平等與相對的平等之兩種意義。絕對的平等以人口爲標準，簡而易明，至於相對的平等，則以勞力爲標準，繁瑣難行，以勞力作爲土地分配的標準，頗能配合生產，若以人口爲土地分配的標準，恐未必能使土地得到合理的利用。吾人能對於土地的分配，做到絕對的平等，誠屬道義上的理想，不過土地分配的絕對平等，以我國的情形而論，尙距離經濟的理想甚遠。根據專家的研究，最適宜於利用的土地，應在高度五百公尺以下，但是這種土地僅佔我國地勢的百分之十四；其在五百公尺以上一千公尺以下者，可以勉强利用，這種土地，也只佔百分之十八，二者合計，亦不過百分之三十二，或謂我國耕地的面積約爲十三萬萬市畝，今以農業人口三億二千萬平均之，每人約可得四畝。按照歐美人民的生活標準，每人需要十六畝土地，才足够一人的生活資料，今我國的農民僅得四畝，彼此相差懸殊。所以我國的土地分配，即使能做到絕對的平等，亦不過是正義感的勝利，欲求經濟上的理想標準，還得格外努力。</p>
<p>不但可供利用的土地，如此貧乏，我們進一步再分析我國土地的墾殖指數，更覺得可憐。所謂</p>
<p>墾殖指數</p>
<p>即指已耕地面積佔全土地面積的百分數而言，如指數高（百分數高）即表示墾殖的程度大，和已耕的土地多；反之指數低則表示墾殖程度小，和已耕之地少。或請我國土地的墾殖指數僅爲百分之十三，而人口之密度又相當高，於此可以證明我國土地之可供利用者本不多，而已耕之土地更少。地大物博的諛詞，豈非是一句極大諷刺嗎？民生的憔悴，可以想見。竊考墾殖指數之所以低，不外有兩個原因，即耕地的縮小，與荒地的增加。耕地的縮小，有絕對與相對的解釋：因變亂或其他原因而直接縮小耕地者謂之絕對的解釋，其因缺乏資金而耕作粗放者，謂之相對的解釋。至於荒地的增加，或因可利用之土地而未盡利用，或已利用之土地改種鴉片烟，又况邊疆之地多荒，海濱之地多荒，山谷之地多荒，或荒於苛捐雜稅，或荒於內戰頻仍，土地生產的低落，誠爲目前爾民經濟的一個嚴重問題。</p>
<p>地權制度的改革，必須運用政治和社會的力量；利於技術的改進，必有賴於科學方法的應用，和經濟設施的推動。前者含有革命性的舉動，而後者必採進化的原理。我以爲土地改革的最大目標，應爲</p>
<p>全民的福利</p>
<p>着想，欲提高人民的物質幸福，必須增加生產，以盡地力。欲盡地力，則科學的方法，必須採用，生產的規模，必須擴大，因此過去的佃租關係，必須廢除。佃租關係，一經取消，則所有權的轉讓，勢在必行，欲達此目的，能採用金融的過程，自可避免流血革命的悲運。我以爲「平均地權」與「耕者有其田」之二大原則，在過渡時期的運用中，皆指土地的使用權而非土地的所有權而言：因爲土地旣然是自然的恩惠，賦有獨占的稀少性，自應歸爲國有，最合理想。我以爲土地的改革問題，實在包括的因素太多，綜上所述，分析如次：（一）制度問題（所有權）：1社會的正義；2政治的革命；（二）技術問題（土地利用）：1經濟的建設；2科學的應用。</p>
<p>土地改革必須對於地權的制度和利用的技術雙管齊下，才能成功，因爲耕者有其田之後，必定需要生產的資金和生產的技術，正彷彿有靈魂而無驅殼，則無所附麗，有軀殼而無靈魂，亦必成爲廢物。我希望能採用不流血的政治革命，達到社會的正義，我更希望採用科學的方法，完成經濟的建設，能如是才不負土地改革的使命。</p>

<h3>鞏固乍浦海防</h3>
<p>— 本報特派員　儲裕生</p>
<p>〔本報杭州一日訊〕抗戰初期，日本無法攻破我堅强的淞滬陣綫，他就利用空隙，在滬杭之間的金孫娘橋與全公亭之間，渡海登陸，以致平湖棄守，淞滬的將士，也祗好轉進了。翻開中國地圖，從江蘇的金山衛，到浙江的金孫娘橋，白沙灣，全公亭，獨山，乍浦，澉浦一帶，都是錢江北海岸，他遙遠的對岸是餘姚等處。乍浦與澉浦，是國父計劃中的東方大港所在地。</p>
<p>鐵沙灘</p>
<p>易於登陸</p>
<p>這條長達四十餘華里的海岸綫，確具有它的重要性，因爲這裏的海　是鐵板沙，祗要用輕帆滑上任何一處灘邊，就可以棄舟登陸。由餘姚赴乍浦一帶，如果遇　好潮風，三小時就能飄來，平時大潮，六小時亦能橫渡。如果一經佔領這海邊，則江南半　，都要受到嚴重的影響。</p>
<p>遜淸時代，對於此地也很注意，築了不少的砲台，淸末時天主敎首善堂來乍浦購地，民初，孫中山先生鼓吹建築東方大港甚力，天主敎紛紛來此買地造屋，當時浙江督軍盧永祥，以此爲要塞區域，遂向外人交涉、期以二十年歸還。天主敎信徒持六十年爲期。後內戰迭起，也沒有收回土地權。到民國廿一·廿二年，浙省府主張闢爲風景區，以黃山爲主要的地區，山陽海灘，可作海濱浴塲，因以十餘元一畝的山地漲到三百，一千元不止。廿四·廿五年，政府劃爲要塞封禁區，從此游人斷絕，成爲軍事地區。抗戰勝利以後，這一帶都變得荒凉殘敗。政府雖仍以乍浦爲要塞區，但顯然地沒有加以佈置，而公開地開放了</p>
<p>三縣綫</p>
<p>互相通話</p>
<p>最近隔岸餘姚的四明山中傳來不寗的消息，白沙灘滸島上，謠傳有數百人要對乍浦的方向登陸，記者爲了此事，曾和金山縣長王紹曾，平湖縣長范文治談及，據他們吿訴我：登陸目前尙不可能，他們自金山衛起各個據點上都有保警隊與常備隊的配合駐守，最近靑年軍也來協助，浙江水警也派一中隊來駐防。在海岸綫的內地，也配置着若干常備隊與保警隊以備应援。平湖縣城離乍浦僅十三公里，平湖和金山有三道縣綫可以互相通話。他們兩位縣長當着我的面說：「要做到手臂相助，唇齒相依。」惟據兩位縣長說，這四十餘華里的海岸綫，最好能派一艘軍艦，不時來往梭巡，則可保無虞了。</p>
<p>黄八妹</p>
<p>經營黃山</p>
<p>記者在乍浦找到了著名抗戰時代的黃八妹（黃百器），她正忙於招呼黃山裏的外賓，那胖胖的臉龐堆着笑容，兩條粗黑的眉毛流露着愉快的表情她的意思是一面應在各處重要的地方建築碉堡，一面政府應該積極地培養民力，她說乍浦這一帶，應該沒有什麽問題的。承她陪我在山中遊覽，她是已經解甲歸田，現正在經營商業，山上有黃山招待所，是她開的現在正還在建築一些房屋，以便租賃給外國朋友。她指給我看一座名高公山，一座名暈頂山，相傳秦始皇在高公山練劍，以劍削暈頂山之巓，山　就被削入海中，我們看見海中眞有一枚小島，浪濤洶湧，正向它侵擊。在海濱，這廣闊的沙灘，遙望着無邊的海，使人胸襟爲之舒暢。</p>
<p>築茅屋</p>
<p>外賓紛至</p>
<p>距海邊不遠的山脚下，築着一排排簡陋的茅屋，聽說這裏茅屋有三百十八間，以一夏季爲租賃期，租費約需五六石白米，來此住宿的人多爲外國人，他們不嫌簡陋，過着週末的生活，他們都　海水浴，據黃百器女士吿訴我：「有幾個女人躺在海灘上晒太陽，皮都脫了，但她們還是晒着。」我們遊覽時，看見對對雙雙，嫣紅姹紫，點綴在綠色的山野間，像翩翩的粉蝶，朵朶的野薔薇，眞够美麗。</p>
<p>登山又有一小普渡」寺，有客室憑窗遠眺，海水浩瀚，浪濤澎湃。又抵海灘邊，渡海抵海中孤島，名「中普陀」，那裏林木蒼鬱，風景天然，據傳山中老和尙水性甚好，能在海底停留三小時。</p>
<p>避暑地</p>
<p>增强建設</p>
<p>現在，在乍浦一帶的人，鞏固海防與建設黃山，看得同樣的重要，因爲黃山是避暑的勝地，外來遊人增加，大可吸收游資，增强建設。平湖縣府想呈准省府撥借廿億，興築　景，兩月後歸還。省府如果能以廿億撥借平湖，則當能吸收更多的遊客無疑。我以爲如果乍浦這一帶，遊客多了，投資也多了，地方上自然會受到實惠，則對於治安與海防也會激起大家更深一層的注意。</p>

<p>〔路透社倫敦一日電〕阿拉伯及猶太領袖今日分在外約但首都阿曼及猶京臺拉維夫開會，準備對安全理事會之巴勒斯坦休戰決議案，提出答覆，該項答覆規定應於一日標準時間晚十一時（上海夏季時間二日上午八時）以前遞達安理會。阿曼方面傳稱，阿拉伯五巨頭中之四巨頭於舉行非正式會議後，業已擬定答覆，俟埃及外長卡夏巴自開羅抵阿曼後，即可最後決定。開羅方面傳稱，阿拉伯方面之答覆，可能爲接受安理會之休戰決議案。埃總理諾克拉茜於召開內閣會議後，曾向記者表示：「阿拉伯聯軍已獲勝利，而此次休戰條件亦較第一次爲佳，吾人殊未便過於堅持。」猶太方面之答覆，在限期屆滿前不久始可望提出。合拉維夫方面感覺聯合國斡旋專員貝那多特昨往該處或可婉轉猶方之態度，然貝那多特本人則表示旣不樂觀亦不悲觀。</p>
<p>〔合衆社成功湖卅一日電〕此間本日逐漸相信，安理會將來不協議於阿人與猶人如拒不放下武器即採取懲罰步驟事因此聯合國最近之巴勒斯坦停戰計劃，遂爲此次信念所搖動。聯合國人士深恐阿猶雙方均將不顧安理會停戰四週及禁運軍火至中法之呼籲。如有一方於六月一日下午十一時（格林成治標準時間）拒絕停戰，則安理會定於二日開始辯論，對違命一方採取何項步驟。現阿猶雙方均認爲，安理會中難得獲致之協議，將在各代表討論制止戰爭之更强硬措施時，又變爲不協議。</p>

<p>查本市海塘，以黃浦江為界，分東西兩塘，東塘長一五·二六公里，西塘長一六·六二公里，因受戰事影響，年久失修，受海水衝出後，致缺口纍纍。復員之後，工務局　於其情勢甚為危急，決先行搶修。自民國卅四年冬起，即進行測量工作，卅五年春，由市府撥款，及行總撥供卡車，開始興工先將海濱浴塲以南之十餘缺口修復完竣。卅六年又呈請行政院撥助經費十億元，至本年五月底止，初步之護岸工程業已先後吿成，總計耗費六十餘位元。</p>

<p>市府方面，鑒於欲整治海塘，護灘護岸同屬重要，以前施工者，純係搶修性質，乃治標工程。欲求塘身之安全，尙有待於護灘工程之興築，俾臻一勞永逸之效，特責成工務局儘速擬具防洪工程之具體計劃，待機而行，經海塘工程委員會於舊曆去年年底漏夜趕成，今春起，工務局長趙祖康，及結構處長朱國洗僕僕奔走於京滬道上，全力促其實現。時行政院雖認為防洪工程極為重要，惟以國府經濟支細，如是浩大之工程經費苦無能力負担，嗣因美救濟米在華配售順利，始行核准，由售米所得款項中撥付，當由水利部將首期經費撥下，日前佳音傳來，市府方面甚表欣喜，工務局刻正忙於海塘工程之籌備事宜。</p>

<h3>對美國扶助日本問題　議長促國人反省　勿單事苛責應自力更生</h3>
<p>市參議會潘議長公展，昨為美國扶助日本問題，發表談話，主張美國匯以加强援華為其遠東政策之重心·大意略謂：在當前之環境下，國人與其徒然苛責美國扶助日本，母寗先力自振作團結，發揮總體戰力量，早日戡平匪亂，則我國當可成為遠東之一大安定勢力。吾人對日政策，素主寬大，但自有其限度。美國若一味扶助日本，致使日本軍閥財閥竟有乘機抬頭之企圖，勢必為吾人所反對，且同時吾人為作戰同盟之一員，在此時尤有呼籲請美國之權利。惟吾人亦尙有所反省者，即抗戰前後，美國本意原擬積極扶助我國，使成為遠東之安定勢力，不幸兩年來共匪稱兵叛亂，不惜以武力奪取政權，致國內政治經濟情形，每况愈下，國際地位遂亦備受影響，而今日一般所見之「反美」運動，亦即由此輩稱兵禍國之徒所陰謀主使。美駐滬總領事葛柏德氏在紀念美國陣亡將士日致詞，其演辭中有云：「中國今日高呼反美扶日之口號者，顯然已忘却中國最審饒之東九省，刻正在新帝國主義者之魔掌中，掙扎圖存。此語實足資國人警惕，目前美國佔領及管制日本，復須支持日本戰後行將崩潰之經濟，當係一沉重之負祖。故使日本經濟略形恢復元氣，以减輕美國對日之經濟負荷，固未必不可見諒於世，然從遠大處着眼，吾人亦不得不指出，美國一部份人士，如為日本獻媚所麻醉，而過分扶日，終將形成一危險之政策，將米恐或自食其惡果。猶憶日本當明治維新之時，英國曾單獨子以扶助，美國復繼之於後，然日本仍排斥英美終致導成珍珠港事變故深望美國目光遠大之政治家，能正視現實，遠矚未來，認淸危機，不蹈覆轍。况中美兩國，　具歷史悠久之友誼，美國果欲維護世界和平，唯有加强援華，始能安定遠東。同時切望全國同胞，萬勿單事苛責美國扶日，尙須自力更生，戳力勘亂建國，使我們成為遠東之安定勢力。</p>

<h3>指數問題當局釋疑　所採物價爲平均數　高低不在項目多寡</h3>
<p>自上月份職工生活費指數發表後，本市若干工人，對工人指數之編制，發現懷疑，認為：（一）五月份指數較四月份增加百分之二十九，而任何人之直覺均感五月物價之上漲，遠過百分之二十九。（二）工人指數逐月低落，其原因為工人指數中之食米所佔百分率，較職員指數為重，且職員指數中列有綢緞·呢絨·電影·水菓等項，而工人指數中皆付缺如，實際上此種項目，在工人生活上亦屬必需。社會局長吳開先乃於昨日向大公社記者發表談話，有所解釋，據稱：（一）編製指數所用之物價，均為每月平均價格，而非月底價格，在物價高漲之際，月底價格之上漲，常較平均上漲為大，而多數人直覺，均以月底百分率為定，致誤以為指數不確。（二）生活費指數為各種物價之加權平均，各月之物價，有上漲甚高者，同時亦有上漲甚少者，如漲率不高之物品，其權數較大，指　漲率目將减輕，但在此稱物品，上漲甚劇時，則指數之漲率必加甚，吾人不應以近一二個月之情形，對之懷疑。（三）指歡編製方法，係依據工人家計調查，經整理分析所得之客觀事實，其中所選物品項目權數以及平均戶量等，均有其科學根據，非可隨意變更。（四）指數之高低，其原因不在項目之多寡，項目多指數不一定高，項目少，亦不一定少。例如職員指數項目多，但五月份仍較工人為低。（五）照指數立塲言，職員並不應較工人低，目前低之原因，全因各種物價較之基期漲落不等所致。故各項物價間如恢復正常狀熊，則職員工人間應無區別。工人生活費上漲緩和，正象微物價漸趨正常。（六）事實上工人指數上漲百分　雖較職員生活費低，然其原因為工人四月份指數較高之故。若以基期為標準，觀察其上漲程度，則工人指數仍較職員指數萬一千倍。</p>
<p>總工會說明指數無訛誤</p>
<p>昨日報載各工會對五月份指數表示不滿，應予考慮編製方法等因，大　社記者，特往訪市總工會生活指數研究會負責人章祝三，詢以關於五月份工人生活指數編製實况，據章謂：（一）總工會之指數編製，完全根據各工會調查通訊網所提供之每週零售物價為依據，此項原始表格，無人可以更改，工會可隨時查看，　總工會對計算指數之公式及單位，悉照市府統計室規定所辦理者，（三）工人生活指數中米·油·煤·糖四項，乃根據富局之配價核算，（四）五月份之物價，第三週為下落狀態，故計算指數時，必須以漲落洛之平均價格為據，（五）指數中之房租，均以市參議會通過之七千倍至九千倍為依據，無人有權變更，（六）職員指數上漲率所以較工人指數為高者，其原因乃由於生活程度及消費物品之不同所致，絕無人可以故意抑低。章氏復稱，「統計指數乃一極為科學化之工作，深望各工會能研究各項原始物價，當可知其無訛」云。</p>

<h3>公用事業所需物品　應採優待結匯辦法　俞總裁對議長建議表示原則可接受</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕本市參議會潘議長，於五月卅一日上午，同訪新任中央銀行總裁俞鴻鈞氏於中央銀行，對政府改善外滙管理，採用結滙證明書辦法，曾交換意見。</p>
<p>據潘氏昨在市參議會吿記者稱：洽　內容，側重在各種公用事業所需要之外滙問題，潘氏謂；民無水火不能生存，公川事業，不但為人民日常生活所需水火之來源，且為一般工業生產之原動力，其現象在各大都市中尤為顯著，故公用事業成本之高低，影響於一般工業製成品之成本與人民生計甚鉅，重要性要亦不亞於米麥肥料及棉花等食物衣着類之原料。政府為安定食物及衣着兩項物價，特於結滙證明書使用辦法中規定，米麥麵粉腮料棉花少進口，及其他經政府核准之用途，　須繳納結　證明書，換言之，上述諸項物品之進口，仍由央行依牌價供給外滙，可免自行洽購外滙貼水之損失，藉資减低成本，本人認為為展宏新外滙政策對於穩定物價之預期效果起見，則於各種公用事業所需向國外訂購之機器，汽油，柴油及自來水廠所用之化學品等，亦應興米麥麵粉等，採取同樣僵待辦法，此項建議與政府頒布之新政策，亦無抵觸，因結滙證明書使用辦法規定經政府核准用途之物品，即可享受央行供給外匯也。</p>
<p>潘氏又稱：上項建議，俞總裁表示原則上可以接受，惟實施辦法，須待與有關方面詳細商量，並須經政府核准後，方可公佈施行。本會前於第五次大會時曾為减除民生疾苦，採取有效辦法，根本穩定物價，以安人心起見，決建議政府對於各種公用事業所必需之材料及燃料，在三個月期內，親定相當穩定之配售或結滙價格，以期减少該事業之漲價因素，尙未荷政府採納施行。本會公用事業調查委員會，旋經決哉將就此一問題向中央各主管部會請願，茲値政府外滙政策有了新的轉變，本人將以昨日與俞總栽所談結果，向本會提出報吿，如經多數同意，將以此項新建議為基礎，定期與央行會談後，正式向政府具體建議，務期減少公用事業漲價之因素，而安定物價之效力。</p>
<h3>呉開先招待工業界人士　商討籌組市工業會事宜</h3>

<p>繼由來滬指導籌組事宜之社會部科長李仕衡致詞稱：上海工業佔全國百分之七十，深望此次市工業曾之組織，能作全國榜樣，待將來組織全國工業總會時，亦以上海工業會為中心。潘議長致詞，希望市工業會成立後，能發揮合作團結之新力量，以渡過此艱鉅時期。國民黨方主委稱：人助先自助，工業界加緊團結改進生產之表現，可使盟邦認識我國正在埋頭苦幹，因而對中國援助更大。一面並望行憲後之政府能眞正瞭解目前工業界之困難情形，協助其解決。</p>
<p>接開籌備會議</p>
<p>吳局長召集之茶話會至此結束，接開市工榮會籌備委員會首次全體會議，於四十九名籌備委員中推出杜月笙·吳蘊初·束雲章·劉鴻生·金潤庫·胡西園·劉丕基·潘士浩·田和卿·榮爾仁·榮鴻元。蔡昕濤·胡伯翔·洪念祖·徐學禹等十五人為籌備委員會常務委員，並互推杜月笙為主任委員。籌備會辦公地址決定假迪化北路全國紗廠聯合會內，並定每星期五開常會一次，次週之星期五則開全體會議。</p>

<h3>「假鳳虛凰」制作英語拷貝　配音下週告成　即運英美公映</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕，前因理髮師「正名」糾紛而致　動一時之「假鳳虛凰」影片，去年曾創國產影片最高賣座紀錄，因此引起英美影業權威之濃厚興趣，迭函文華公司，要求將該片製作英語拷貝，運英美放映。文華以此舉尙為國產影片之創舉，為表示鄭重，特由該片導演黃佐臨先將原詞譯成英語對白一册，於年初與該片原有之國語拷貝一部同時携赴倫敦，向英國各方徵訽意見。結果博得一致好評，認為劇情中由亂離時代所產生之男女問的悲歡離合，及內含之幽默意識，必能為英美人士普遍接受，渠等對英譯對白尤許為傳神之作，故建議與其加印英文字幕，母寗製作英語拷貝，更易使英美觀衆發生興趣。至此文華乃正式決定一試，仍由黃主持其事，定英文片名為「TheBarber　takes　a　Wife」，延攪有深湛英文修　並具舞臺經驗者四人，於四月間開始配音。原片之鏡頭並不刪節，僅將發音部份完全　換。迄目前止，祗待音樂部份配妥，約下週內即可全部吿成，在國內試映後，即先運美，再轉英倫次第公開放映。</p>
<p>配音人選</p>
<p>至配昔之人選，係由李遂銀小姐飾片中范如華，馬家馴擔任「三號」，古巴擔任「七號」，而由黃佐臨夫人丹尼飾陳國芳。其中李為廣東人，係上海體專之運動健將，馬現為英文大美晚報記者，曾在天津演渦英語話劇「王寳　」，古亦曾在美參加舞台劇演出，丹尼則為黃昔日英劍橋大學時代研究戲劇之同學，四人英語造詣及舞台經驗，俱極精湛。此次分任片中四主角之配音工作，，一月來在黃之指導下，對語調·發音·感情等曾苦心研揣，故最後成績表現極為優異。現開尙有「浮生六記」「蝴蝶夢」二片，亦將繼「假鳳虛鳳」後製作英語配音拷貝，則將來國產電影藝術，必可因源源輸出而在國外大放異彩。</p>

<p>開會後，即將央行第一三四號通函逐條細讀，加以研討，有意見時，即由劉攻芸氏加以解釋。討論結果，由大會提出意見四項：（一）外匯之外匯結匯證明書，准許自由流通買賣。（二）通函第二十五條規定，指定銀行每日外匯餘額不得超過一千美元，認為限制太嚴，希望提高至五千美元。（三）通函第三條規定，出口商需向指定銀行申報貨物之品質數量及外匯價値，查明無誤，方能辦理手緻；按此為海關之通常手續，不應由指定銀行負責，指定銀行負賣者為信用無誤。（四）央行應授權指定銀行，在某種情形之下，得簽發特種結滙蹬明書。劉攻芸當塲對前三點要求，表示接受，俟本辦法完成正式手續後，常加以修正；第四點要求則尙待考慮。會議至五時半始結束。</p>

<p>央行解釋　條文意義</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕中央銀行昨日對指定銀行發出第二三六號通函，大意謂：第一三四號通函內第二十八條規定進口商申請買滙時，須有同値之結滙證明書。所謂「同値」之意義，即指某一結滙證明書之價値，與某一輸入許可證價値之距離，不能超過五十美元或其同等滙値。</p>

<h3>輸管會將于今日公布　改善貿易管制辦法</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕結滙證明書制度實行後，昨日已有豬鬃業向指定銀行申請結滙，惟該戶所得證明書，因無吸收對象，並未售出。證明書之正式交易雖未做開，但據聞市縐喊價在每元美金値國幣五十萬至六十萬之間，加外滙牌價四七萬四千元後，合計一百萬元左右，較黑市略低，但相差並不過遠，故今日我國之出口業，形勢必然好轉。輸管會昨日繼續開會，商討今後之新貿易政策，今日可能公佈。一般推測今後之輸入限額亦放寬，自備外滙將有條件開放，以便人量輸入生產器材。政府將减低供應市價外匯之數字，而希望藉增加出口之手段，提高輸入量，以滿足工業界及進口業之需要。</p>

<p>昨日棉布市況，同業斬售甚夥，惟客幫見低則進，染廠則有紡建縣牌供售，場內甚鮮進出，市盤曲折下游。十二磅龍頭細布晨開軋小十五萬元，為六百七十五萬。嗣因布號家了售殊多，行情再瀉至六百五十八萬元，臨收時聞華北滙款尙有到滬，北帮乘小有進，並悉紗價尙穩定，浮空抵補，價乃回上至六百六十四萬元，收盤較上日續跌二十六萬元。其他各細布細斜組布漂布及嗶嘰色布林士布等一致下挫甚鉅。</p>

<h3>從兵</h3>
<p>— 莫泊桑著　李青厓譯</p>
<p>這所塞滿了軍官們的公墓竟像是一所萬花齊放的園圃了。軍帽，玫瑰紫的軍褲，金袖章，金衣鈕，軍刀，參謀人員的　章金穗子，輕裝步兵和輕裝騎兵的顏色大氅，都在墳墓之閭來來往往，墳墓上的那些或者白的或者黑的十字架，在死者已歸消滅的遣骸上邊兒，展開牠們那些使人　然的鐵質的石質的或者木質的臂膊。</p>
<p>有人剛剛埋好了黎穆山團長的夫人。她是在兩天以前游泳的時候淹死的。</p>
<p>事情完了，敎士走了，但是那位團長由軍官們扶着立在金井跟前，他向着那裏邊依然看得見那隻收藏他的少妻已經開始腐敗的遺體的匣子。</p>
<p>這幾乎是一個老翁，一個髭鬚全白的瘦長子，三年之前，他娶了他的同抱索爾迪團長的孤女</p>
<p>那兩個被長官靠着的上尉和中尉盡力引他走開。他却含着兩限眶用英雄姿態忍住不敎落下的限淚抵抗起來，后來低聲吞呑吐吐地說：「不行，不行，還略略等一曾兒」，他支起兩隻不得力的腿子堅決地留在那地方，留在金井的邊兒上，這金井在他眼里像是沒有底的一條使他的心和他的生命，他剩在世上的一切，通通洛下去的深淵。</p>
<p>忽然，沃爾　將軍走到跟前了，他抓着這團長的臂膊幾乎是使力挽着他，一面向他說：「怎麽，怎麽，老朋友，不應當蹲在這兒」。於是他表示服從，末了才回家去。</p>
<p>剛好推開了自己書齋的門，他望見了書桌上有一封信。拿起了這封信，他幾乎因為驚訝和感動而跌倒了，因為他認得這是他天人的筆跡。並且信上的郵票蓋的是當天的戳子。於是他拆開了信封兒就讀起來：</p>
<p>「父親，請您如同以前一樣允許我叫您父親罷。您接到這封信的時候，我必然死了，並且入土了。這樣您也許能够原諒我。</p>
<p>「我並不願意想甚麼法子，來使您受感動和减輕我的罪名。只用一個在一點鐘之內將自殺的女人的誠懇態度，來說淸楚完整無遺的眞像。</p>
<p>「在您從前由於仁慈而娶我的時候，我是由於報恩而向您捨身的，並且我用了我的女孩子式的眞心愛您。我當時之愛您幾乎利我往日之愛爸爸一樣；後來，某一天，因為我坐在您的膝頭上，而且又因為您吻我，我就忍不住呌您「父親」。那是當時一道從本能陡然而起的良心上的呼應。眞地，您當時在我的頭腦裏是一個父親，僅僅是一個父親而已。您笑了，並且對我說過：「永遠這樣呌我罷，我的孩子，這敎我伏樂。</p>
<p>「我們到了這個城市裏之後……現在請您饒我，父親，我成了有所鍾情的了。　！我曾經　抗過多時，幾乎兩年請您聽淸定，幾乎兩年，後來我屈服了，　成了罪人了，我成了一個失敗的婦人了</p>
<p>「至於「他」。您必然猜不　是　。我對於這一　是很放心的，因為他們一共有十二個軍官，始終繞在我的四週並且和我出出進進，您早就稱乎他們做我的十二座衛星。</p>
<p>「父親，請您不必恕法子去認明他，並且請您不必恨他。他做了任何人在他的地位也曾對我做的事，並且，我　實　道他也眞心愛我。</p>
<p>「不過，謂您組聽罷：某一大，我們的約會是在鷓鴣洲；您可知通？水磨那邊的那個小洲。我應富游泳到那兒登陸，他應當在　木業裏等我，並且再蹲到傍晚，　免得有人看見他出來。我那大剛剛找着了他，忽見從那些分開的枝葉之問看見了裴力卜，您的從兵，他對我們實行了奇襲。我當時感到我們都失敗了，並且我大呌了一聲；於是他對我說，他，我的朋友：「您游水走開罷，慢慢兒，親愛的，等我和這漢子留在這兒」。</p>
<p>「我走開了，心裏那樣　張，自己幾乎淹在水裏，後來回到了您家裏，靜候可怕的事兒。</p>
<p>「一點鐘之後，斐力卜在客廳過道裏遇見了我，他低聲向我說：「我現在來聽候馬丹的吩咐，倘若馬丹有甚麼信要交給我」。於是我明白他已經出賣了自己，而買他的就是我的朋友。</p>
<p>「我在事實上交過他許多信，我全部的信。他都送了去，並且又給我帶來了回音。</p>
<p>「這樣約莫經過兩個月之久。我們當時都信任他，正和您當時信任他一樣。</p>
<p>「說到這兒，父新，就是落到我身邊的事了。某一天在我從前遊水而往的那個洲上我又遇見了您那個從兵，不過，單獨一個人，這次。這傢伙正等着我，於是預先通知我說他立刻就向您舉發我們並且交出許多被他偷來留下的信件，倘若我對他的欲望不表示屈服。</p>
<p>「吹，父親，我的父親，我當時害怕，這是一種卑劣庸懦的害怕，尤其害怕您，這樣仁慈而被我欺負，也為他而害怕，您可以殺他，又為我自己而害怕，也許，現在我知道嗎？當時，我已經糊塗了，張皇失措了，我相信於再把這個也愛我的惡　收買一回，這是何等的羞辱！</p>
<p>「我們希望是這樣薄弱的，我們道此女人，以至於我們失策之處比你們多。此外，一個人在已經墜落的時候，是始終向更低更低的處所墜落的。現在我知道我從前做了甚麼嗎？僅僅明白了你們兩人中的一個和我自己都快要死去而已——我終於向這個暴徒屈服了。</p>
<p>「您現在看見，父親，您現在看見我不肯替自己要求卸責罷</p>
<p>「於是，於是，於是，我預料了的事終於到了——他在願意用這個威嚇我的時候一次又一次地掌握了我。他又做了我的情夫，和另一個一樣，見天。這不是難堪的嗎？並且是一種何等樣的處罰，父親喲！</p>
<p>「於是，我呢，我向自己說：「應當死」。活着呢，我不能向您懺悔一種這樣的大罪。死了，我甚麼都敢。除了死之外，我甚麽都不能做了，世上再沒有甚麼可以洗刷我，我的汚點太厲害了·我不能愛人，也不能被人愛了；像是我使誰都　化了，僅僅給人握手的時候。</p>
<p>「等會兒，我就去游泳，並且不再回來了。</p>
<p>「這封寫給您的信先要寄到我的情夫那裏去。他在我死了之後一定接得着牠，並且甚麽也不明白就把牠寄給您，因而究成了我最後的自由。末了，您從公墓上回家之後讀得着牠。</p>
<p>「永訣了，父親，我甚麽也沒有可以對您說的了。請您照着您願意做的做龍，並且請您恕我』。</p>
<p>這位團長擦了自己那例滿是汗珠兒的額頭。他的冷靜態度，身臨戰塲時的冷靜態度，徒然又回到他的身上了。</p>
<p>他打鈴了。</p>
<p>一個用人走進來。</p>
<p>呌斐力卜到我這兒來，他說。</p>
<p>隨後，他微微抽開了他書桌的一隻抽斗。</p>
<p>那漢子幾乎立刻就進來了，這是一個大紅髭鬚的高個兒兵士，神氣刁狡，目光閃灼。</p>
<p>這位團長雙目直射着他。</p>
<p>——你就給我說我老婆的情夫是誰。</p>
<p>——究竟，團長……</p>
<p>這軍官在那隻微微開着的抽斗裏握着自己的手槍。</p>
<p>——說罷，並且趕快罷，你知道我是不說笑話的。</p>
<p>——那末……團長……就是聖亞爾培上尉。</p>
<p>剛好他說出了這個姓名，立刻一道火光燒了他的眼睛，於是他仆着躺下了，一粒槍子嵌進了他的額頭中央。</p>
<p>八十歲以前，她一天不工作，便像遭受禁閉，她說：「寗可害病不能閒。』</p>
<p>國軍，日本兔子，游擊隊，偽軍，眞正的土匪，她雖足不出戶，却都曾一一遭逢過。她常常半夜三更起來帶着拚死的喊聲驅逐土匪。</p>
<p>死神應向她低頭，因為她無所恐懼。她祈禱死，她深信陰間裏絕對比陽間裏太平。</p>
<p>『而今不中用了，吃閒飯。」這是她的口頭禪。</p>
<p>九十三歲的老人，因為失去工作能力而吃一碗閒飯，像對已，對人，對宇宙萬物，都表示了由衷的慚愧。</p>
<p>母親在完　納稅之餘，一心供佛。她為省去婆媳之間的閒言，戒絕二十年老　的畢烟。</p>
<p>夏天勸她打防疫針，她總是拿「老太婆學時髦，笑殺人』的話來拒絕。她眼睛有此一昏花了，常把醬油碗裏的死蒼蠅和着糙米飯一齊吃下去。別人替她担憂，她說沒關係，菩薩會保佑心善的人。</p>
<p>我的月薪一百二，她歡喜到懷疑的程度，她認為日不見太陽夜不見天，拿這樣多的錢是說不過去的。她担心着我有不祥的事情發生。</p>
<p>她惟一的缺點就是永遠搞不淸國，共，奸，匪，保安隊，自衛隊的區別。她常常帶着歉意的表情，把這些老問題循環的苦惱着我。她本不要問這些事情，因為這些問題已逼得她不能唸經了</p>
<p>我家道幾位無知識的親人的生活，給我的敎訓。眞比大學敎授給我的還多。我的人格與思想，很受着他們的影響。因為他們，我懂得節約，懂得同情，懂得現實生活。他們呌我對另外一些人起了從未平息過的仇恨，以致常常起一種不足為外人道的決心。我雖沒有依照我的決心去做，却多少喝住了我身心雙方的墮落。我還認為我自已是隨時可以挽救的。</p>
<p>關於這題目，我本來還要寫一些，例如我的嫂嫂，在浣衣回家的草地上，拾一根指頭闊的破布條，總要帶回去打一紐扣，以備不時之需之類。但是我想起我的家人，都是過的全國中上人家的中上生活這一層，我就不好意思再嚕囌了。</p>
<h3>山水</h3>
<p>— 弭鞠田</p>
<h3>家人小誌</h3>
<p>— 張鳴春</p>
<p>二十五年前小學入學考試的國文題—家人小誌—我現在要自動的重做一次。</p>
<p>我父親是個手把犁頭的自耕農。稻花香時，他是莊前土地祠量先的敬神者；也是搶先納稅著名全村的好人。過去的鄉約，地保，對他表示滿意，說他「識相」。放高利的人，稱他為模範；因為他有先期還款照繳全利的美德。</p>
<p>他一度被推為保長。因公款項下積餘了十六元，無法處理，以致寢食不安，惹得妹妹們都不敢高聲說笑。</p>
<p>他是官廳崇拜主義者，為了縣府催騐田契，震警於佈吿上」過期嚴懲不貸」的字樣，因而緊張過度，檢點復檢點，還將同一契紙騐了兩回，懊恨到憤會責備的母親不忍發他的脾氣。</p>
<p>地方豪　對他開過不大不小的玩笑，他當着故事吿訴我，從未提過報復。他以超度的勤勞與忍辱，來適應環境，平衡生活，維持生存。</p>
<p>他結婚時的一雙鞋子，直到他五十九歲壽終正寢時還保持半新。</p>
<p>就胆怯說，他是有福的；因為他在八一三以前就逝世了。</p>
<p>我有一位今年實足九十三歲而從未離開田園的外祖母。她除去獨女—我的母親—外，無第二個親人，所以經常住在我家。我母親四歲時，外祖父就死了，我看到外祖母，像看到一座活的貞節　。</p>
<p>說來也怪，她常初反對過我讀書。惟一的原因，怕我長大了會做狀詞打官司。她看輕讀書人也識透了官廳。</p>
<p>她幾乎不使用紙幣。</p>
<p>「一担糞要賣人家五千元，不作興！不作興！」抗戰以來，她常常發這樣的議論，說的時候，總是搖着本來自動搖着的頭。</p>
<h3>黃鳥</h3>
<p>— 綠風</p>
<p>你們九百多位戰鬥的健將隨着麥秀的暖風來到這人類戰鬥的市塲。</p>
<p>幸運的小鳥呀！住着房屋而旅行，佩着銀鈎與玉盞，嵌的象牙和翡翠，上面刻着激昂慷慨的「出師表」那是說你也懂得「鞠躬盡瘁」！</p>
<p>打開了籠門，戰鬥開始了！你咬他的脚脛，他啄你的頭頸，互相撲擊，衝殺，再顧不了美麗的羽　，騰躍翻滾，　　不已。</p>
<p>正　那戰場上衝　號裏廝殺聲起，直到對方　羽而逃，嬌黃的羽毛片片零亂地灑上鮮血，於是人們喝采，鼓掌，讚美！</p>
<p>你髣髴也懂得在這人類的市塲生存就是戰鬥，為了自已，也為業養你的主子。</p>
<p>我却為　想起在原野，在森林，當湖濱的晨曦初起，那美麗的傳說—你們的朋友正與情敵戰鬥而死。</p>
<h3>最近的世界文壇</h3>
<p>— 趙深</p>
<p>德國戰時文藝</p>
<p>在戰時，德國宣傳部一向對於書店與圖書館壓迫得很厲害，因此非納粹的文藝，不僅別國圖書館中罕有，迎德國本國的圖書館都是罕有的。無論燒書或是禁書，書仍舊羅續出版。反對納粹的書旣不允許出版，德國便只好出名作家著作的重版，即所謂古典名著了。這些作家大部分是十八九世紀的。這種書籍的流行，不僅僅是為了逃避，而是趁這機會，司以仔細欣賞德國過去文學的偉大。</p>
<p>印塞爾出版社（Insel—Verlag）和來比錫（Leipzig）書店所出浪漫派作家的全集有女作家特洛司特（Annette　von　Droste—Hulshoff，1797—18　　）用印度紙在一九三九年印成一卷，愛興獨夫（Joseph　von　Eichendorff，1788—1857）全集在一九四〇年印成兩卷，諾法利司（Novaiis）的著作則在一九四二年出版。諾法利司全集乃沙繆耳（R．H．Samuel）所原編，他現任Metbourne大學教授。史鐵夫脫（Adalbert　Stifter）的全集則為七卷本，凡諭文二卷，小說「偉替柯」「夏天以後」和「小品」則在一九三九年和一九四三年出版。普羅配蘭（Propy　aen）出版社刊行了歷史批評版本的　爾德林（Friedrlch　Holderlin　1770—1843）全集四卷，由西伯斯（Friedrich　Seebas）作序。費息爾（S．Fischer）在一九四二年出版了十七卷的霍普特曼全集本。選集則有女作家索倫他諾（Ciemens　Brentano1778—1842）和楊包爾（Jean　Paul，1763—1825）的作品。幽默文學家布士奇（Wlihelm　Busch）的全集八卷本在一九四四年出版；因為其中有給猶太朋友的幾封信，便被禁止。同樣的情形是羅德爾（Roedl）所寫的「史鐵夫脫傳」，因為他是猶太人的後　。</p>
<p>許多重要的書簡也發現了。孛倫他諾的「與美麗兒的通信」（Priefwechselmit　Sophie　Mereau）出版於一九三九；茂立開（Ecuard　Morike）的　　集則出版於一九三九亦由西　斯　序。</p>
<p>最大的成功是二種　書：「明鏡」叢書，內收七十餘種小說；「Trosteinsamkeit」當書，內收短篇小說二百餘種；「德國抒情詩永久的寳藏」業書，內收詩集三十種。</p>
<p>有時出書的目的。只是為了攻擊納粹，僅只蒙了一層薄紗。很轉明地用的是影印的辦法，納粹沒有方法抓他們的錯。例如史鐵夫脫的「要求人類文化的讀本」的重印，單只這題目，就是與納粹意識相反的。費息爾書店又車印了克勞杜司（Matthias　Claudius）全集三卷，在一九四一年出版，仍用一七七五年的蝕雕和木刻插圖，其中極多攻擊軍國主義的話。</p>
<p>國外文學的譯本則不能十分表示德國民衆的確實要求。美國史坦培克的譯本也不少。其他有拉辛，哥　爾，普希金，史　夫特等。</p>
<p>下面的傳記的和批評的訊究是値得提起的：格南斯曼（Wilhelm　Grenzmann）的「里獎坦堡」（G．Chr．Lichtenberg）但尼克（Otto　Dencke）的「里契坦堡傳」一九四三年　爾德林百年紀念的時候，出過一本紀念論文集。關於哥德，也出過兩本好書。</p>
<p>下面是一些現代德國小說家的作品，其中有幾位是大家所熟知的。一切這些都値得研究現代德國文學的人注意：</p>
<p>白爾根格魯恩（Werner　Bergengruen）的「將　大時想些什麽」這是寫痛苦和歇士底里亞的歷史小說。米特里爾（Verika　Mitterer）的「遠方的王子」則是中世紀的故事。烏里支（Arnold　Ulitz）的「倫敦的魔術」則是狄福式的小說。海　爾林（Konrad　Haemmerling）和格魯梭夫（Erna　Grauthoff）都以莎士比亞為題材而寫小說。路德（Arthur　Luther）的「魔鬼」寫的是俄國詩人萊芒托夫。魏奇爾特的「簡單的生活」也是一本好書。</p>

<h3>拆掉「石神廟」！</h3>
<p>— 銅駝</p>
<p>我一向以為愚夫愚婦在農村中最多，即如逢時逢節，想娛樂一下，也要借一下神的名目，像迎神賽會，草臺戲之類，無不以酬神的名義來舉行。殊不知道生活在都市裏的人，儘管科學昌明，物質享受與農村中簡陋的生活相差不知幾千萬倍，還是有更多的迷信者，以佞神拜佛為唯一職志，以燒香求籤為唯一娛樂，眞是感到二十年前所喊出的舊口號，在政治上有關的「德先生」，與在社會文化上有關的「賽先生」，同樣還需要大聲疾呼，提醒一下。</p>
<p>可悲的是，都市裏的迷信者的愚蠢程度，竟尤甚於鄉村。一個鄉村裏的病人，求求仙方，請方士來消災畫卦，祈禱多福，病人在自然的生理調養之下，病態逐漸轉機，循至霍然，於是歸功於神的呵護，還有其一貫的迷信之道。都市裏的病人則不然，一方面在用現代化的針劑治療，電氣治療，驗血驗便——種種從生理學，解剖學，藥物學所獲得的結論，循着純科學的途徑醫治疾病；但另一方面仍舊不廢愚昧的書面：買獎券要求神，賭花會要求神，娼妓祈禱淫業興隆要求神，妻子祝望臨盆產男要求神……又因都市裏神佛非常之缺少，於是乎跑馬廳畔一對石刻翁仲也當作妙相莊嚴的神佛，朝朝夜夜，有人在道旁向之作搗蒜式的叩頭了。</p>
<p>最近愚夫愚婦們對於跑馬廳畔的兩位翁仲，更其信奉唯謹，上一　額，稱之為石神廟，施以眞金，懸以紅綢，裝以臘架，配以香爐，蔚成「道旁的廟宇」之雄觀。若說這是有裨於社會者，則僅有一點，即是使附近的小癟三們不必朝夕流浪，他們無形之間獲得了一種新的職業：相同於寺庵之中的廟祝。他們為求神者裝香點燭，當前者去而後者來的時候，此項香燭之餘燼，他們已顧不得求神者的誠意誠心，與夫石翁仲之香火供奉，老實不客氣的拔了下來作躉批出售。當然也有愚夫愚婦為了他們代點香燭（他們還供給蒲團以備跪拜之用）給一點錢以酬其「服務」之勞的。</p>
<p>前天報載，俞叔平局長下令禁止愚夫愚婦在那個「石神廟」前燒查，派兩名警察在旁監視，理田是阻礙交通。我本來在懷疑：上海市政府開明的施政已建有良好的口碑，但何以見不及此，竟把「石神廟」一舉取消。即使今日的都市還留有若干汚點，我們至少可以先來洗刷掉汚點中問的一個。現在果然警察局在出來干涉了，雖然他們的理由僅是軟弱的「阻礙交通」，其實堂而皇之，就說是破除迷信可也。如其當局有下一決心的話，我認為不僅是派幾名崗警去禁止就算是執行了他們的任務，因為這是消極的；根本辦法，唯有把匾額敲碎，裝師品撤除，再用水泥把石翁仲塗抹，才是澈底的辦法。如其當局肯轉移其禁舞精神於禁止迷信，用禁鴉片的手段來禁止佞神拜佛，豈非一件快事！本報三十日於報導此一新聞結束時的轉載閑人閑話，所謂「看他俞叔平做得成功局長嗎」這類阿Q式辱駡，儘管置諸一笑可也</p>
<p>鄙人對於宗敎之尊重，一如科學，但覺得宗敎與迷信是截然兩件事，如其不向迷信搏鬥，則純正的宗敎終無法表顯。迷信與鴉片一樣的需要打倒，消滅今日變本加厲的「石神廟一只是其一端而已。</p>
<h3>體與用</h3>
<p>— 孫鶴</p>
<p>政治上興革，我覺得可以借宋儒對道學的兩字來說明：一個是「體」，一個是「用」。前者是政策，主義，原則。後者屬於技術，方法，作風。</p>
<p>一體」的方面必須確立而能實踐；「用」倒是枝節問題了。</p>
<p>三民主義與官僚主義不兩立。實行三民主義則官僚主義不打自倒，祗要有實行的決心和勇氣。方法縱然不高明，技術縱然低下，作風縱然幼稚，祗是時間問題，必然很快的改正，不致　覆轍的。</p>
<p>開車的技術是一個小問題，主要的看方向準確與否。方向對，也就是方向盤把得穩，駕駛雖不純然，祗要不開倒車，慢慢地便會走向康莊走向目的。方向不準，即使技術高，會開快車，仍然不免覆轍。這是平凡的眞理。</p>
<p>我覺得不必斤斤於挑剔行政上技術的效率，有類於吹毛求疵。我們當然不可再諱疾忌醫，但挑剔小毛病也不見得有利於病人。我們需要找病源，找癥結，而不必祗看表面上的症候，與薪比秋毫畢竟要緊得多。治標　退寒熟，止頭痛，不如治本的殺細菌，淸內贓。謹以此獻於新內閣。</p>
<h3>似是而非</h3>
<p>— 尤墨君</p>
<p>莊十「得手應心」，今已變為「得心應手」；又同書「每下愈况」，亦久已變為「每况愈下」，前本談已有同文正其誤。此種似是而非之語還很多，且亦不限於兩字之互易；今舉「不一而足」，「談何容易」，和「飛黃騰踏」三句來談談；</p>
<p>「不　而足」，語出公羊襄公二十九年傳，言不以一事之美而遽足之，今已通用作事非一次解，且用之已慣，亦不覺其非了。這是因纏誤而變成似是而非的。</p>
<p>「談何容易」見漢書東方朔傳。「吳王曰：『先生可以談矣。』先生曰：『談何容易！』」「何容」猶言豈可。又後漢　何進傳：「國家之事，亦何容易？」據此，「容」不連「易」字讀，故「何容易」猶言「豈可若是之易？」這是因割裂成文而變為似是而非的，且用之已慣，亦已變為積非成是了。</p>
<p>「飛黃騰達」之「達」應為「踏」。飛黃是馬名韓昌黎詩：「飛黃騰踏去，不能顧蟾蜍」。黃表馬之色，飛狀馬行之速，故雖「踏」也不能顧到蟾蜍了。現在把「踏」變為「達」，想是把「黃」誤解做從前皇帝所出的「黃榜」所致。這是因誤解變成似是而非的。</p>
<h3>琴話</h3>
<p>— 半夢老人</p>
<p>往余在北平時，有同學張君，工於操　，每富風淸月白之夜，輒抱琴相過，為余撫數弄，余雖不知琴，未能如伯牙之於鍾期，厠身知音之列，但聽之亦覺津津有味，躁氣潛消，覺較之其他樂器不同，實有引人入勝之感。</p>
<p>張君室有五琴，其一最短最古，彼在作官白門時，有人掘諸土中轉購得之者，斷紋斑駁，五百年以上物也。彈之法越，如空山鐘聲，流泉激響，較其他四琴為佳。張君云，凡琴到余手，一望即知其佳劣，不必操縱安絃，引商刻羽，而始別其年代之遠近，余深以為然。張君屬余作一銘，刻諾斯琴之上，余同不文，亦屬外行，當時勉集成語與之，未免孤負是琴之美，佛頭著糞，貽笑大方耳。</p>
<p>張君又云：琴材以桐面梓底者為上；純桐者為次；桐面杉底者又次。琴取桐為陽木，梓為陰木，陰陽相配，其聲乃和。若純用桐木，亦須以桐之陽而為面，陰面為底，以取陰陽調和。如何取法，則選桐木之向日者截取，沉之水中，其陽面向上，其陰面向下，浸水久之，取其向上之面，製為琴面，向下之面，制為琴底，琴旣製成，琴面之材，旦濁而暮淸，晴濁而雨淸，琴底之材，旦淸而暮濁，晴淸而雨濁，善彈者均可以意會之，細入亳芒，非粗躁人所能明瞭。張君屢欲以指法相授，惜余不耐勾挑之苦，婉言謝之，此事距今已二十餘年矣。</p>
<p>詩云：「椅桐村漆，爰伐琴瑟。」以桐梓為琴，相沿已久；後人亦有以銅與石，興　檀烏木等為琴者，且有以各種短材，膠漆而成，稱為百納琴者。又有以龜紋錦片，錯雜玳現象牙香料嵌骨，鋪滿琴體，而稱為實琴者，大都屬於裝飾品，非琴之正旨也。故宮陳列所，有宋廣窑琴，謂之瓷琴，承以紫檀，象制中程，修短合度，胎骨畢露，其質紫沙，徽十有三，塡以白拗，軫足悉以自玉為之。龍池中有銘曰：「維沙陶瓦，制從鴻濛，鳶飛魚躍，為歌南風。」鳳沼內有「修身理性」四字，字作秦篆，其色月白，極晶瑩澄澈之致。以指扣之，聲如瓦缶，聞徽州鄭穎孫善鼓琴，張絃鼓之，未能成聲，其亦屬於裝飾品之類歟？</p>
<p>瓷琴漆匣上有八家題詞，其上為乾隆御題。嵇璜云：「陶人秘製，協於桐絲，匪肖其形，神理斯存。有宋雅器，霄諒孰倫，謝彼斤斵，天然無痕。想搏埴初，太和胚渾，瑟若玉粹，藹乎春溫。」錢陳羣云：「官耶定耶正色呈，七絃旣上和且平，一鼓四座春，再鼓阜吾民，穆然見舜河之濱。」董邦達云：「匪丹匪漆，匪石匪金，土型作德靜以深，河濱陶出南董琴，嶧陽有枝空陰森，經火尾不焦，密理紋無侵，　將完璞託古心，水汨沒山山欹崟，一搏一拊揚元音。」餘不盡錄。昔陶元亮有沒絃琴，曰：「但得琴中趣，何勞絃上音。」大音必希，大味必淡，如瓷琴者，其殆斯旨歟？</p>
<h3>不祥的第九交響樂</h3>
<p>— 國平</p>
<p>德國大音樂家悲多芬（一七七〇—一八二七）作成了第儿個交響曲後便逝世了。近代德國音樂家勃勒格納（一八二四——一八九六）作了第九首交鄉曲，未完成最末一樂章而死了。同樣，又一位德國音樂家馬勒爾（一八六〇——一九一一），一完成第九交響曲後，也瞑目長逝了。他們三人的誕生地都是維也納。</p>
<p>關於馬勒爾，有下面一個實事。馬勒爾是極　信的，當他見到悲多芬和勃勒格爾的命運後，便在作完了第八交響曲後工作暫吿段落。他開始從事於寫作歌曲，想與命運　決鬭一下，他的意思是不願意有「死於第九交響曲」之名。不久，他退休到阿爾卑斯山的一個鄉村中，因感到四周的風景太美，不禁便把他的情感付諸第九交響曲中。他開始製曲，忘記了前車之鑒。</p>
<p>一天，當馬斯爾在寫最後一個最偉大的樂章時，猝然從窗外飛進一老鷹，在室內迴旋鼓翼，因此灰泥四起，譜紙飛散，馬勒爾便迅坐在安樂椅中。當這老鷹飛出後，在安樂椅底下又飛出一烏鴉，馬勒爾認為是不祥之兆（德國認烏鴉為不吉之烏），心神恍惚良久。他知道死神在來臨，但心中却平安起來。他將濃厚的情感，偉大的旋律，灌進他的最後一章中。他完成了第九交響曲，但等不到他開始寫第十交響曲時，他便病死在鄉村中。可喜的是：他這支第儿交響曲名滿世界，許多樂隊都奏着他這支不朽的曲子。如果誰看過「亂世佳人」影片而他懂得音樂，那麼他一定曾聽到這支交響曲中的幾個樂章。</p>
<h3>劉瑾之死</h3>
<p>— 行健</p>
<p>在帝皇獨尊的封建時代，對於謀反叛逆者的處置是十分殘酷的，除了九旅全誅之外，對主犯本人也是儘量的使他痛苦，慢慢的死去；更有凌遲處死了之後剁皮」「揎草磨骨揚灰」的，像製標本一般的用來示衆。</p>
<p>關於　遲的刀數，言者紛紛，莫衷一是。有的說八十一刀，有的說剮一百另八刀，但依書籍所載，其最慘酷者竟殺三千三百五十七刀之多，需時二日方死。</p>
<p>明張文麟端嚴公年譜，記其為刑部主事時，親睹劉瑾被處決之情形云：</p>
<p>「……其後奉旨，劉瑾凌遲三日，剉尸梟首，書影岡形，榜示天下。凌遲刀書例該三千三百五十七刀，每十刀一歇一吆喝。頭一日例該先剮三百五十七刀，如大指甲片，在胸膛左右起，初動刀時有血流寸許，再動刀則無血矣。人言犯人受驚，血俱入小腹小腿肚，剮畢開膛，則血皆從此出。至晚押瑾順天府宛平縣寄監，釋縛數刻，瑾尙能食粥二碗。次日則押至東角頭。先日瑾就刑，頗言內事，以麻核塞口，數十刀氣絕，時方日升在彼，與同監斬御具史本奏，奉聖旨：劉瑾凌遲數足，剉尸，免梟首。剉尸當胸一大斧，胸去數丈。」</p>
<p>由此觀之，凌遲之慘酷，已達極點。與今之化刑比，可謂大巫小巫矣。</p>

<h3>The First Joint Conference of the Executive Yuan Under Constitutional Rule Sets Forth Policy Guidelines to be Presented to the Legislative Yuan; Weng Wenhao Encourages Colleagues to Share the Heavy Responsibility</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 1st] After the appointment and announcement of the heads of various ministries and commissions of the first Executive Yuan under constitutional rule, most of them took office on the 1st and held the first political affairs meeting at the Executive Yuan at 9:00 AM to discuss the new Executive Yuan's policy guidelines. The meeting was chaired by Weng Wenhao, who first delivered a speech outlining his views on the future policy of the Executive Yuan. Attending committee members and attendees Wang Yunwu, Wang Shijie, Zhang Lisheng, Lei Zhen, He Yingqin, Yu Hongjun, and others spoke separately, offering opinions on administrative reform, believing that a firm decision should be made to overcome difficulties and weather the crisis. Some pointed out that the current task should be to unite the military under political leadership to stabilize social order, and that the formulation of policy guidelines should be simple and concise, explaining only the important aspects, without listing the work of each department, which would only make them verbose and impractical. After discussion, it was decided that the heads of the departments responsible for actual work should submit written opinions within three days, to be compiled by the Premier to draft the overall policy guidelines, and then attend the Legislative Yuan to report. Secondly, Central Bank Governor Yu Hongjun also reported on the foreign exchange settlement methods and implementation process. Wang Yunwu explained the current financial difficulties, stating that he was appointed to head the Ministry of Finance and hoped for guidance and advice from all parties. Finally, the meeting discussed the rules of procedure for the Executive Yuan meetings. Because the Executive Yuan's organizational law differed in spirit from the previous organizational law, the current Executive Yuan's organization is based on a supervisory system, so the proceedings should be revised in accordance with this spirit, and the revision was approved after discussion. The first meeting adjourned at about 1:00 PM. All attending committee members were present either in person or by representative, except for the two ministers of the Youth Party and the two political commissars Chen Qitian, Zuo Shunsheng, Yang Yongjun, and Zheng Zhenwen, who were absent due to reasons, and Vice Premier Gu Mengyu and political commissar Dong Xian Guang, who had not yet returned to Nanjing to attend. In the afternoon, most of the re-elected ministers went to their offices as usual. The newly appointed Minister of Food Guan Jiyu and Minister of Finance Wang Yunwu separately consulted with their predecessors Yu Feipeng and Yu Hongjun to discuss handover matters and had not yet reported to their departments to take up their new posts.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 1st] At the first political affairs meeting of the Executive Yuan today, Premier Weng encouraged his colleagues to share the difficulties of the times, jointly shoulder the heavy responsibility, so as to turn danger into safety and lay the foundation for constitutional government. Premier Weng pointed out that the current responsibility is to implement constitutional rule and suppress the rebellion. The people of the whole country and friendly countries around the world have high expectations for our government, and he hoped that everyone could be of one mind and jointly shoulder this major responsibility, cultivate a spirit of proactive progress, and open up a brighter future for the entire country. However, the Communist Party, disregarding national interests, recklessly engages in destruction and slaughter, resulting in people's livelihood being in dire straits and an unprecedented disaster. In the future, we must take the people's food, clothing, housing, and transportation as our daily goals, earnestly plan and earnestly implement, in order to save the current hardship. He continued that the US donation and loan to help our recovery must be deeply self-encouraging, and sincerely discuss with the US personnel handling aid to China, give play to the spirit of self-help and self-reliance, in order to repay the good intentions of friendly countries in assisting and supporting us. Finally, Weng expressed his hope to discuss and formulate policy guidelines as soon as possible, so as to submit a report to the Legislative Yuan, and also hoped that the Youth Party colleagues would take office as soon as possible, and that the Democratic Socialist Party could still participate in government cooperation.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 1st] The Executive Yuan has successively appointed Jiang Yuntian and Peng Xuepei as consultants to the Executive Yuan. In addition, the Executive Yuan's political affairs meetings, which are routinely held every Tuesday, have been changed to every Wednesday due to a conflict with the scheduled time of the Legislative Yuan's regular meetings.</p>
<h3>The Sixth Meeting of the Legislative Yuan Passes a Resolution to Establish a Special Committee for US Aid, Investigate the Capital of Powerful Families, and Submit Research Methods to the Finance and Banking Committee; Three Articles of the Organizational Law are Amended</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 1st] The Sixth Meeting of the First Session of the First Legislative Yuan was held at 9:30 AM on the 1st. Secretary-General Zhang Zhaoyuan reported that President Sun was absent on official business and requested the attending committee members to mutually elect one person to serve as chairman. Cheng Tianfang was elected by the assembly to serve as chairman. First, the minutes of the previous meeting were approved. Then, Secretary-General Zhang reported that a joint meeting of the conveners of various committees would be held on the 2nd to discuss "their own affairs" of the Legislative Yuan, and reporters were not allowed to attend. Then, the matters for discussion were carried out in the order prescribed by the agenda.</p>
<p>The first case was the report by Cheng Tianfang, Chen Guyuan, and Zheng Yanfen on sorting out Articles 3, 4, and 5 of the Legislative Yuan's Organizational Law. After Chen Guyuan's explanation, after some textual discussion by the assembly, it was still passed according to the original proposal (see another article). The second case was the proposal by Hao Yaodong and others "to determine the closing date of this session and plan to complete important work before the closing." The third case was the proposal by Chen Mingxian and others "to improve the work efficiency of this session of the Legislative Yuan." As a result of the discussion, Yin Shuxian's suggestion was passed, that these two cases cannot be made into laws, and there is no need to make a resolution. Relevant committees should pay attention to them, and the speaking committee members are requested to save meeting time.</p>
<p>The fourth case was the special review committee's proposal to establish a program committee, a special committee for investigating the capital of powerful families, and a special committee for US aid. The special review committee's report on the program committee was: "A program committee shall be established, but it is not necessary to stipulate it in the organizational law. The members of this committee may be appointed by one member from each standing committee. Meetings shall be convened at any time when procedural issues arise." After the proposer Zhang Huiwen's explanation, it was accepted by the assembly and passed without objection. As for the establishment of the special committee for investigating the capital of powerful families, after the proposer Feng Junlian's explanation, it encountered opposition from a majority of the committee members, who unanimously believed that the capital of powerful families should indeed be investigated, settled, eliminated, and prevented, but the establishment of a committee may harm legislation due to procedural delays, which is not necessary. Finally, with the approval of 299 people (out of 410 people present), Guo Dengao's suggestion was passed, that a special committee is not necessary, and the relevant matters for handling the capital of powerful families shall be submitted to the Finance and Banking Committee for research methods, and relevant laws and regulations shall be drafted. The meeting adjourned at 12:00.</p>
<p>The meeting continued at 3:30 PM in the afternoon, still chaired by Cheng Tianfang, to continue discussing the fourth case of establishing a special committee for US aid. After the proposer Qiu Hanping explained the necessity of establishing the special committee, both sides started a debate. Lai Lian, Pan Chaoying, Liu Zhendong, Xu Panyun, Pan Yanxing, Pan Lianfang, and others supported the establishment, believing that US aid is very important to the current domestic situation, financial stability will rely on it, production and construction will rely on it for development, and US aid is a debt, which increases the burden on the people, and the parliament should intervene. The Legislative Yuan should set up a special committee to be responsible for paying attention to research. Ni Yujie, Tao Rong, Yu Zheng, and others believed that the implementation of US aid utilization is in the Executive Yuan, and supervision is in the Control Yuan. The Legislative Yuan should trust the government so that it can do things freely. Finally, the vote was passed with the approval of 160 people (out of 301 people present) to establish a special committee for US aid, and then its organization was discussed, and it was decided that all committee members could participate freely.</p>
<h3>Amended Articles of the Legislative Yuan's Organizational Law</h3>

<h3>The Provincial and County Autonomy General Rules Case Will Be Discussed Again at the Next Meeting</h3>
<p>The fifth case was the draft of the Provincial and County Autonomy General Rules proposed by Lv Fusuo. After Lv explained that his draft was prepared using an open doctrine, several committee members paid for the review. Xiao Zheng raised a procedural issue, in addition to accusing the secretariat of failing to deliver the agenda to each committee member two days in advance in accordance with Article 20 of the rules of procedure, he also said: This important bill should not be rushed, and all committee members have not conducted prior research, and cannot rashly pass it as a first reading and pay for the review. He advocated postponing it to the next meeting for discussion, which was passed by the assembly without objection. Wang Kaihua also suggested that the secretariat should request the draft previously drafted by the Ministry of Internal Affairs for reference.</p>
<h3>The Case of Preventing Aiding Japan is First Submitted to the Foreign Affairs Committee for Review</h3>
<p>After a break at 5:20, the chairman reported that Li Yunliang and others had submitted an emergency proposal: "Please ask the government to take urgent measures to prevent all actions that promote Japan's military and economic power, and be vigilant about the possible serious crisis caused by the US Dyle Plan." After seeking the consent of the assembly, the agenda was changed to conduct the discussion. After the rapporteur read out the full text of the proposal and Li's explanation, Liu Baimin, Meng Yunqiao, Chen Ruxuan, and others all believed that the case was not very urgent, but an ordinary diplomatic case, and advocated that it should be submitted to the Foreign Affairs Committee for review first. This opinion was passed by a vote of 250 people (out of 304 people present). The meeting was adjourned at about 6:00 PM, and the cases were not discussed, leaving them for discussion at the next meeting.</p>

<h3>The Preparatory Committee of the Control Yuan Passes the Draft Control Law</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 1st] The preparatory committee of the first Control Yuan under constitutional rule has passed the drafted Control Law. The law is divided into four types of regulations: (1) the power of consent, (2) the power of impeachment, (3) the power of censure, and (4) the power of correction. The draft passed by the preparatory committee will be referred to the Yuan meeting. If the Yuan meeting considers it inapplicable during the discussion, it will be drafted separately. The principles on which the law is based are in accordance with the provisions of the Constitution. The Control Yuan has never had such complete regulations in the past, and now it is just being created. The power of consent section stipulates the exercise of the power of consent for the president and vice presidents of the Judicial and Examination Yuan, as well as the Examination Committee and the Grand Justices. The power of impeachment section stipulates the manner in which impeachment cases are filed against public officials for illegal or derelict acts.

<h3>Our Position on Japan is Firm; Attention is Paid to the US Attitude on the Issue of Reparations</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 1st] Recently, there have been many opinions in various places against the United States supporting Japan. Li Yunliang also had a relevant proposal focusing on shipping at the Legislative Yuan meeting on the 1st. According to reporters, the government has paid attention to the expression of such public opinion. In addition, a certain relevant person talked to reporters about this issue on the 1st. Briefly stated: Regarding the policy adopted by the United States on the issue of Japanese reparations, our government has always attached great importance to it. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has repeatedly instructed our Ambassador Gu Weijun, who attended the Far East Commission, to pay close attention to the plans to be put forward by the representatives sent by the United States each time. However, the United States has not yet taken any action to change the originally approved compensation principles. In his address at the inauguration ceremony on the 20th of last month, our President Chiang Kai-shek clearly stated that although our country adopts a lenient policy towards Japan and does not make excessive demands, since our country has suffered eight years of war of resistance and has been greatly invaded, when deciding on the peace treaty with Japan, it is still necessary to require other allied countries to recognize that our country should have a special status in the peace conference. The firmness of our country's position need not be said more.</p>

<h3>Air Force Covers Nationalist Troops Outside Jinan, Counterattacks Along Both Sides of the Jinpu Railway, Recovering Haozhai and Yanglou in Xuzhou's Peaceful Surroundings</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Jinan, 1st Dispatch] Starting at 9 AM today, Nationalist troops outside Jinan, under the cover of the Air Force, began counterattacking towards Tai'an along both sides of the Jinpu Railway. By noon, they had crossed Sunjiayu, a key point south of Wande, and were continuing their advance. Nationalist troop strength at Dakou on the southern route has been reinforced, and they are firmly defending its northern key point, Yunfeng Mountain. Three bandit columns that crossed the Yellow River fled to the southeastern area of Yuncheng on the 31st, and Nationalist troops are currently encircling and attacking them.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Jinan, 1st Dispatch] The 7th Column, among the four bandit columns that invaded the central section of the Jinpu Railway, was counterattacked by Nationalist troops at Sunjiayu, south of Wande, at noon today. The New 8th Column is moving from Tai'an towards Dakou, and the main force of the 13th Column fled from Tai'an's Xiwulongkou to Dakou starting on the evening of the 31st, where telecommunications were cut off on the 1st. The New 11th Column remains based near Feicheng, and the 9th Column is based in Shouguang. The area outside Jinan is still calm. Nationalist troops on the eastern route have automatically withdrawn west from Mingshui to Longshan to ensure the safety of Jinan. According to general assessments, the focus of the war has shifted to the area outside Yanzhou due to the southward flight of the bandit's 13th and New 8th Columns and the flight of three columns that crossed the Yellow River to the southeast of Yuncheng.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Jinan, 1st Dispatch] It is reported that the bandits fleeing to the southeast of Yuncheng are Chen Yi's 1st, 4th, and 6th Columns, who are continuing to press towards the outer perimeter of Yanzhou. Nationalist troops have increased their strength and are currently counterattacking. Furthermore, Dakou is currently still in the hands of Nationalist troops.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Xuzhou, 1st Dispatch] The situation outside Xuzhou has stabilized. Nationalist troops advancing westward along the Longhai Railway captured Haozhai and Yanglou stations this afternoon. The garrison at Huangkou has joined forces with Nationalist troops, and Huangkou has been relieved. Furthermore, the area more than ten li outside Dangshan City remains under the control of Nationalist troops.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Xuzhou, 1st Dispatch] The bandits who harassed the area near Jiahezhai (8 kilometers west of Xuzhou) and Haozhai and Yanglou were routed westward by Nationalist troops at 3 AM today. Fierce fighting is still ongoing in Huangkou. A portion of more than 5,000 bandits invading the Dangshan area fled north across the Longhai Railway to the border between Fengxian and Shanxian at 2 AM today. More than 3,000 bandits briefly entered Xiaoxian City at 9 AM on the 31st, but were repelled by the garrison and fled northwest. The Jinpu Railway between Lincheng and Guanqiao has been severely damaged by bandits and is being repaired. The bandits who invaded Caocun have retreated west, and Xushi and Anjing are normal.</p>

<h3>Key Points for Revising Trade Management Measures</h3>
<p>After the announcement of the "Measures for Using Foreign Exchange Settlement Certificates," we raised several doubts about the management of import and export trade, especially regarding quota allocation, the foreign exchange issue of importers concurrently operating exports, and the issue of importing goods with self-provided foreign exchange. We believed that these issues needed careful consideration and adjustment. Recently, the improvement of trade control has attracted widespread attention, and the Export Control Committee is discussing specific measures, which are expected to be realized soon. Regarding these revised measures, we would like to reiterate our views for reference.</p>
<p>First, regarding the quota system, it is said that the revised measures still intend to maintain it. However, how the quotas and allocation standards will be revised has not yet been revealed. In addition to announcing the quotas as circumstances change, rather than making rigid regulations, it is a well-known fact that the quotas were too tight in the past and the allocation to various regions was not entirely reasonable. Since importers are now responsible for negotiating and purchasing foreign exchange from exporters, and the Central Bank no longer supplies it, in principle, exports can be encouraged as much as possible, and overseas remittances and self-provided foreign exchange can be absorbed as much as possible for supply. It is not necessary to tighten the quotas too much to alleviate the serious situation of work stoppages, production reductions, and factory migration to the south.</p>
<p>Second, Appendix 1, namely the part on production equipment, is said to be largely or entirely opened up, allowing imports to be purchased with self-provided foreign exchange. This was originally something that the central government had been considering for two years, and it is something that everyone has been eagerly awaiting. We should support it and hope that it will be realized soon. Because many factories are limited by import restrictions for the machines and parts they need and cannot replenish them, they have no choice but to partially shut down, which hinders production. It is said that the reason for setting up factories in Hong Kong is also because the machines and components that they need cannot be imported. This naturally becomes a legitimate reason for them to use as an excuse. If production equipment is allowed to be imported freely with self-provided foreign exchange without being subject to current regulations, the difficulties of manufacturers in various regions can be resolved, and the trend of factories moving south may also be alleviated. This is naturally much better than the rigid, stopgap measure of banning the export of cotton spindles promulgated by the Ministry of Economic Affairs. However, there are also various types of production equipment: some are for manufacturing daily necessities for people's livelihoods, and some are of a relatively less important nature; some can use local materials to develop the use of native goods, and some have few raw materials and must rely on foreign goods; some industries have a slightly thicker foundation, and the current supply can barely be maintained, and some have too few substitutes and cannot be self-sufficient without foreign goods. For the sake of maximizing benefits and effectively utilizing planned economy, it seems necessary to distinguish and select so-called production equipment. Especially when the raw materials produced domestically are too few and most of them need foreign assistance, it is worth considering whether they should be treated equally and not be selected for, especially in today's context, when foreign exchange resources are clearly limited. Because the more this equipment is imported, the more the need for foreign raw materials in the future and the foreign exchange that needs to be imported will inevitably increase. This is probably not the most ideal solution!</p>
<p>Third, other than purchasing production equipment for import, there has been no news about self-provided foreign exchange. We believe that regardless of overseas remittances or foreign exchange from exports, in addition to using it according to the "Measures for Foreign Exchange Settlement Certificates," the owners should also retain a portion and be allowed to handle the import of goods themselves after obtaining an import permit to encourage them. That is, in addition to allowing self-provided foreign exchange to be used to purchase production equipment, if they voluntarily handle the import of goods, they only need to apply in advance and obtain permission, and there is no need to discriminate against them, causing suspicion and obstruction. Now that foreign exchange funds are so scarce and the expansion of export business may not be as satisfactory as desired, and there are so many savings of Chinese people escaping abroad and foreign exchange from overseas Chinese flowing into Hong Kong, then, under the premise of not hindering foreign exchange management and trade management, everything may as well be relaxed to attract more people so that the funds that have escaped can return to the country and engage in production.</p>
<p>Some people are worried that if goods are allowed to be imported at the same time as production equipment, this fund will be put into consumer goods, and this is not without reason. However, since the import permit system has not been abolished, consumer goods cannot be imported freely, and the right to approve or disapprove still rests with the Export Control Committee. As long as they are reviewed in accordance with the law and smuggling is strengthened at any time, these concerns are really unfounded. If favoritism is shown and imports are allowed illegally, or the efficiency of anti-smuggling is too low to prevent smuggling, then it is obviously not a legislative issue.</p>
<p>In short, it is a recognized fact that trade management measures must be revised, and for the sake of intensifying the promotion of exports and absorbing all foreign exchange funds, we also believe that the newly established foreign exchange settlement certificate measures need to be supplemented again.</p>
<h3>Professor Zhao Naibu Speaks Freely on Two Major Issues of Land Reform</h3>
<p>System and technology are two sides of the same coin when it comes to land problems. The system is a matter of land rights, and technology is a matter of utilization. Without improving the system, it is difficult to seek progress in technology. Without progress in technology, even if the system is changed, it will not help improve people's livelihoods. In China, since the Qin and Han dynasties, almost every dynasty, at the time of rise and fall, had a set of land policies that emerged as their political capital. Unfortunately, the results of the attempts have never been completely successful. All reforms were either abandoned halfway or simply could not be implemented. Dong Zhongshu, He Wu, Kong Guang and others of the Han Dynasty first advocated the "land limitation" policy, but it was just empty talk and was not implemented. Wang Mang established the "Royal Land" system, intending to reform the system of private land ownership, but its implementation for less than three years led to the phenomenon of "treacherous officials and cunning people invading together, and the masses of people living in unrest for a long time" and failed completely. The land grant policy of the Wei, Jin, and Southern and Northern Dynasties had the slightest intention of equalizing land and limiting land, but it was difficult to verify the dispersal of households, the forced sales by powerful people were extremely fierce, and coupled with the lack of diligent implementation, it ultimately achieved little effect. In the early Tang Dynasty, the system of inheriting household shares was adopted, supplemented by the Rent, Labor, and Tax System. Although nominally claiming to be equalization of land, land rights were not actually equal. The land limitation law was adopted in the Song Dynasty, but it was not prohibited by law to mortgage and sublease, so the actual amount exceeded by much. Wang Anshi's land policy aimed to support owner-farmers. On the one hand, the square field taxation method was adopted to prevent large landlords from evading taxes. On the other hand, the Green Sprouts Law was adopted to provide owner-farmers with financial accommodation. The legislation was not bad to begin with, but it ultimately failed due to difficulties in obstruction. The land system of the Yuan, Ming, and Qing dynasties was extremely chaotic, and the trend of annexation was even more rampant. The so-called royal land, limited land, permanent land, and single whip methods were only temporary remedies, and it was difficult to implement them for a long time. Looking at the land policies of the past dynasties, they were limited to institutional reforms and had very little technological progress. Therefore, land reform became a cyclical evolution of systems, without any technological metabolism. Moreover, the motivation for land reform in the past was to suppress the rich and help the poor, and there was a lack of clear awareness of the technical aspects of production. Therefore, the reason for its failure lies in the disconnection between politics and economics.</p>
<p>The institutional issue of land reform is the issue of land rights.</p>
<p>Review of Land Rights</p>
<p>Belongs to the category of distribution. Distribution can be discussed in two aspects: one is the distribution of land itself, and the other is the distribution of agricultural products. The former discusses land ownership, and the latter discusses land rent. Regarding the distribution of land nationwide, there are two different statistics: one indicates that the degree of land concentration in China is not too high; the other indicates that the degree of land concentration in China is quite serious. However, we must understand that the concentration of land distribution sometimes only indicates the concentration of property, and does not necessarily indicate the concentration of agricultural production and management. In other words, the existence of large landlords does not necessarily mean the operation of large farms. Due to the concentration of land property, it has caused serious problems in social distribution. Due to the scattered use of land, it has created serious problems in economic production. Therefore, China's land problem has been subjected to this double pressure, and it is very difficult to seek reform. Because of the concentration of land property and the scattered use, various land rent systems have been created, which generally include three major types: labor rent, in-kind rent, and cash rent. The existence of this tenancy relationship may have different opinions on the impact on production efficiency, but there is no doubt that the excessive fragmentation of the farm area hinders the scientific methods of machine production.</p>
<p>The distribution of land</p>
<p>Can be divided into two meanings: absolute equality and relative equality. Absolute equality uses population as the standard, which is simple and easy to understand. As for relative equality, it uses labor as the standard, which is complicated and difficult to implement. Using labor as the standard for land distribution can well match production. If population is used as the standard for land distribution, it may not be able to make the land be used rationally. If we can achieve absolute equality in the distribution of land, it is indeed a moral ideal. However, the absolute equality of land distribution is still far from the economic ideal in China's situation. According to experts' research, the land most suitable for utilization should be below 500 meters in altitude, but this type of land only accounts for 14% of China's terrain. Those above 500 meters and below 1,000 meters can be used reluctantly, and this type of land only accounts for 18%. The total of the two is only 32%. Some say that the area of cultivated land in China is about 1.3 billion mu, and if it is averaged by the agricultural population of 320 million, each person can get about 4 mu. According to the living standards of European and American people, each person needs 16 mu of land to be sufficient for one person's living materials. Now Chinese farmers only get 4 mu, which is a huge difference. Therefore, even if the distribution of land can achieve absolute equality, it is only a victory for the sense of justice. To seek the ideal economic standard, we still have to work harder.</p>
<p>Not only is the land available for utilization so scarce, we will further analyze China's land reclamation index, which is even more pitiful. The so-called</p>
<p>Reclamation Index</p>
<p>Refers to the percentage of cultivated land area to the total land area. If the index is high (the percentage is high), it means that the degree of reclamation is high, and there is more cultivated land. Conversely, a low index indicates a small degree of reclamation and less cultivated land. Or please, China's land reclamation index is only 13%, and the population density is quite high. From this, it can be proved that there is not much land in China that can be used, and there is even less cultivated land. Is the flattery of "vast land and abundant resources" not a great irony? The haggardness of people's livelihoods can be imagined. I humbly examine that the reason why the reclamation index is low is nothing more than two reasons, namely the shrinking of cultivated land and the increase of wasteland. The shrinking of cultivated land has absolute and relative explanations: the direct shrinking of cultivated land due to turmoil or other reasons is called the absolute explanation, and the rough cultivation due to lack of funds is called the relative explanation. As for the increase of wasteland, either the land that can be utilized is not fully utilized, or the land that has been utilized is used to grow opium. Moreover, there is much wasteland in the border areas, much wasteland in the coastal areas, and much wasteland in the valleys. Or it is wasted due to exorbitant taxes, or it is wasted due to frequent civil wars. The decline in land production is indeed a serious problem for the current people's economy.</p>
<p>The reform of the land rights system must use political and social forces; improving technology must rely on the application of scientific methods and the promotion of economic facilities. The former contains revolutionary actions, while the latter must adopt the principles of evolution. I believe that the biggest goal of land reform should be</p>
<p>The welfare of the whole people</p>
<p>Thinking, to improve the material happiness of the people, we must increase production to maximize the use of land. To maximize the use of land, scientific methods must be adopted, and the scale of production must be expanded. Therefore, the tenancy relationship in the past must be abolished. Once the tenancy relationship is abolished, the transfer of ownership is inevitable. To achieve this goal, the use of financial processes can avoid the tragic fate of bloody revolution. I believe that the two major principles of "equal land rights" and "land to the tiller" refer to the right to use land rather than the ownership of land in the application of the transition period: because land is a natural gift, endowed with exclusive scarcity, it should belong to the state, which is the most ideal. I believe that the issue of land reform really includes too many factors. To sum up, the analysis is as follows: (1) System problem (ownership): 1 Social justice; 2 Political revolution; (2) Technical problem (land use): 1 Economic construction; 2 Scientific application.</p>
<p>Land reform must take a two-pronged approach to the land rights system and the technology of utilization to succeed, because after the tiller has his own land, he will definitely need production funds and production technology, just like having a soul but no shell, there is nothing to attach to, having a shell but no soul, it must become waste. I hope to adopt a bloodless political revolution to achieve social justice. I hope to adopt scientific methods to complete economic construction. Only in this way can we live up to the mission of land reform.</p>

From Yuyao to the Zhapu area, if one encounters a favorable tidal wind, it takes only three hours to drift over. During regular high tides, it takes six hours to cross. If this coastline is occupied, the entire southern region of the Yangtze River will be severely impacted.</p>
<p>During the late Qing Dynasty, great attention was paid to this area, and many forts were built. Towards the end of the Qing Dynasty, the Catholic Church's She Shan Hall came to Zhapu to purchase land. In the early years of the Republic, Sun Yat-sen strongly advocated the construction of the Oriental Great Port, and Catholics came here to buy land and build houses. At that time, Lu Yongxiang, the Military Governor of Zhejiang, considered this a strategic area and negotiated with foreigners for its return in twenty years. The Catholic believers insisted on a sixty-year lease. Later, internal wars broke out frequently, and the land rights were not recovered. In the years 1932 and 1933, the Zhejiang Provincial Government proposed developing it into a scenic area, with Huangshan as the main area, and the Shanyang beach as a seaside resort, which caused the price of mountainous land to rise from a dozen yuan per mu to over three hundred or even a thousand yuan. In 1935 and 1936, the government designated it as a fortified restricted area, and from then on, tourists disappeared, and it became a military zone. After the victory of the War of Resistance, this area became desolate and dilapidated. Although the government still designated Zhapu as a fortified area, it was clearly not fortified and was openly opened.</p>
<p>Three County Lines</p>
<p>Mutual Communication</p>
<p>Recently, uneasy news has come from the Siming Mountains across the river in Yuyao. Rumors on Baisha Beach and Hu Island suggest that hundreds of people are planning to land in the direction of Zhapu. For this reason, this reporter spoke with Wang Shaozeng, the County Magistrate of Jinshan, and Fan Wenzhi, the County Magistrate of Pinghu. They informed me that a landing is currently impossible. They have police teams and regular troops stationed at every stronghold from Jinshanwei onwards. Recently, youth troops have also come to assist, and the Zhejiang Water Police has also sent a company to be stationed. In the inland of the coastline, there are also some regular troops and police teams deployed for support. Pinghu County is only thirteen kilometers away from Zhapu, and Pinghu and Jinshan have three county lines that can communicate with each other. The two county magistrates said to my face, "We must act as supporting arms and dependent lips and teeth." However, according to the two county magistrates, it would be best to have a warship patrolling the coastline of over forty li from time to time to ensure safety.</p>
<p>Huang Bamei</p>
<p>Managing Huangshan</p>
<p>The reporter found the famous Huang Bamei (Huang Baiqi) from the War of Resistance era in Zhapu. She was busy greeting foreign guests in Huangshan. Her chubby face was full of smiles, and her thick black eyebrows revealed a happy expression. Her idea is that while building bunkers in important places, the government should actively cultivate civilian strength. She said that there should be no problem in the Zhapu area. She accompanied me on a tour of the mountains. She has already retired from the military and is now engaged in business. There is the Huangshan Guest House on the mountain, which she opened, and she is still building some houses to rent to foreign friends. She pointed out to me a mountain called Gaogong Mountain and another called Yunding Mountain. It is said that Emperor Qinshihuang practiced swordsmanship on Gaogong Mountain, and used his sword to cut off the top of Yunding Mountain, and the top of the mountain was cut into the sea. We saw a small island in the sea, with waves surging towards it. On the beach, the vast sandy beach, looking out to the endless sea, makes one feel refreshed.</p>
<p>Building Thatched Cottages</p>
<p>Foreign Guests Flock In</p>
<p>Not far from the beach, at the foot of the mountain, are rows of simple thatched cottages. It is said that there are three hundred and eighteen thatched cottages here, with a rental period of one summer season, and the rent is about five or six shi of white rice. Most of the people who come here to stay are foreigners. They do not mind the simplicity and live a weekend life. They all enjoy swimming in the sea. According to Ms. Huang Baiqi, "Some women lie on the beach sunbathing, and their skin peels off, but they still sunbathe." When we toured, we saw pairs of couples, dressed in bright colors, dotting the green mountains, like fluttering butterflies and wild roses in bloom, truly beautiful.</p>
<p>Climbing the mountain, there is also a "Little Putuo Temple", with guest rooms overlooking the vast sea and surging waves. Reaching the beach, crossing the sea to the isolated island in the sea, called "Zhongputuo", where the forests are lush and the scenery is natural. It is said that the old monk in the mountain is very good at swimming and can stay underwater for three hours.</p>
<p>Summer Resort</p>
<p>Enhancing Construction</p>
<p>Now, people in the Zhapu area see strengthening coastal defense and developing Huangshan as equally important, because Huangshan is a summer resort, and the increase in foreign tourists can attract more investment and enhance construction. The Pinghu County Government wants to apply to the Provincial Government for a loan of 2 billion to build scenic spots, to be returned in two months. If the Provincial Government can lend 2 billion to Pinghu, it will undoubtedly attract more tourists. I believe that if there are more tourists and more investment in the Zhapu area, the local area will naturally benefit, and this will also arouse everyone's deeper attention to public security and coastal defense.</p>
<h3>Where Did Over 12,000 Shi of Grain from Jurong Go?</h3>
<p>[Report from Jurong by this newspaper, May 29th] Originally, the figure for this year's loan was 15 shi per bao, of which 12 shi from last year's loan, plus interest of 10%, or 1 shi and 20 jin, should be deducted, totaling 13 shi and 20 jin. The actual loan was only 180 jin. In order to understand the truth about this grain loan, this reporter visited County Magistrate Chen on the 28th to inquire about the situation. He explained in detail, saying, "According to the reports from the heads of various granaries today, the amount of grain that should be stored is 22,293 shi, and the actual amount stored is 9,593 shi, of which reserve grain accounts for 8,979 shi, and county-level public grain only accounts for 614 shi. The most alarming thing is that the former County Magistrate Qi Min owes 127,000 shi. Today (the 28th), I have specifically ordered Fang Tingdong, who was responsible for the handover during the tenure of the former County Magistrate Shi, to hand over all the outstanding amounts clearly in order to resolve the current serious crises of 'public', 'education', and 'agriculture'." The County Council held an emergency meeting and, in addition to sending telegrams to relevant government offices in the province to call for a thorough investigation, Vice Director Zhou of the Provincial Office was put in charge of strictly ordering the former County Magistrate Shi to return the grain before further investigating his responsibility.</p>

<h3>Israel Unconditionally Accepts Ceasefire Proposal of the Security Council; Arab League Has Not Yet Responded</h3>
<p>[Report from This Newspaper] New York, 1st Broadcast: Washington Report, a UN official spokesperson said that the State of Israel has accepted the UN's proposed four-week ceasefire in Palestine and a simultaneous ban on arms shipments to the Middle East, without any conditions attached. It is expected that a note will be submitted to UN Secretary-General Trygve Lie before the deadline of 7:00 PM tonight. The UN is currently awaiting a response from the Arab nations. If the Arab side accepts this plan, Palestine will have at least four weeks of peace, during which a general embargo will be implemented, and the UN will seek a more permanent solution to the Arab-Jewish dispute.</p>
<p>[Report from This Newspaper] New York, 1st Broadcast: Lake Success Reportedly, Israel's response included "explanations." If the "explanations" have the significance of "reservations", difficulties may arise in the Security Council.</p>
<p>[Report from This Newspaper] New York, 1st Broadcast: Lake Success Reportedly, representatives from Egypt and Syria said that as of now, they have not received any responses from their respective governments regarding the UN's proposed four-week ceasefire plan for Palestine, nor are there any signs that they will. However, some instructions may be received this afternoon.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 1st] Arab and Jewish leaders met today in Amman, the capital of Transjordan, and Tel Aviv, the Jewish capital, respectively, to prepare responses to the Security Council's Palestine ceasefire resolution. The response is required to reach the Security Council before 11:00 PM standard time on the 1st (8:00 AM Shanghai summer time on the 2nd). Reports from Amman said that four of the five major Arab powers had drafted a response after holding an informal meeting, which would be finalized after Egyptian Foreign Minister Khashaba arrived in Amman from Cairo. Reports from Cairo said that the Arab response might be to accept the Security Council's ceasefire resolution. Egyptian Prime Minister Nokrashy told reporters after convening a cabinet meeting: "The Arab Allied Forces have won a victory, and the terms of this ceasefire are better than the first one. We should not insist too much." The Jewish response is not expected to be submitted until shortly before the deadline. There is a feeling in Tel Aviv that UN mediator Count Bernadotte's visit there yesterday may have softened the Jewish stance, but Bernadotte himself said he was neither optimistic nor pessimistic.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Lake Success, 31st] There is a growing belief here today that the Security Council will not agree on punitive steps against Arabs and Jews if they refuse to lay down their arms. Therefore, the recent UN ceasefire plan for Palestine has been shaken by this belief. UN officials fear that both sides will ignore the Security Council's call for a four-week ceasefire and an arms embargo to the Middle East. If one side refuses to cease fire by 11:00 PM (Greenwich Mean Time) on June 1st, the Security Council will begin debating on the 2nd what steps to take against the violating party. Currently, both sides believe that the agreement that is difficult to achieve in the Security Council will turn into disagreement again when the representatives discuss stronger measures to stop the war.</p>
<h3>Holy Land Mediator Bernadotte Negotiates Ceasefire with Arabs and Jews; Visited Shertok and Azzam Separately</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 31st] British Foreign Office officials believe that the resolution of various details during the ceasefire period will be handled by UN mediator Count Folke Bernadotte.

He himself took a Red Cross special plane directly to Amman, the capital of Transjordan, to meet with Arab League Secretary-General Azzam, but observers believe that the meeting was of little consequence.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Cairo, 31st] Arab League Secretary-General Azzam told UN Palestine mediator Count Folke Bernadotte last night that the Arab countries are determined to eliminate the State of Israel. Azzam claimed at a press conference today that he was alone with Bernadotte during the meeting, and the Count had recorded his words. Azzam hopes that the Count can succeed based on the principles he stated.</p>

A full day of heated debate is expected.

<h3>US Publishes Guidance Plan for Factories to Switch to Wartime Production</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Washington, 31st] The Armed Forces Munitions Board appealed to private industry on the 31st to begin its own plans, preparing to mobilize quickly in the event of an atomic war. The board's director, Haggerty, released a 46-page guidance chart to help authorities at every factory in the United States prepare methods of production now for any eventuality in the future. He solemnly pointed out that the plan does not mean that there will be a war in the near future, but said, "When the atomic bombs begin to drop, there will be no time to start planning again. We must do it now. Preparation is the basis of peace. A vigilant country that is prepared for events in the military and industrial fields has the best chance of avoiding such events." Haggerty added that if private industry can prepare its own advance plans, it can save three to six months of "precious time" in future mobilization.</p>
<h3>US Republican Primaries Held Separately in Two States</h3>
<p>[United Press International, Washington, 31st] The selection of 1,094 Republican National Convention delegates will be completed after the two-state primary elections held on the 1st, and the three-state convention to be held on the 11th. One primary election is in California and the other in South Dakota. The state convention is held in Indiana. California will have 53 delegates supporting Governor Warren, South Dakota is expected to have 11 supporting Stassen, and Indiana has a total of 29 delegates. With only three weeks left until the Republican National Convention on June 21, based on the number of delegates pledged to each candidate, the number of delegates possessed by each Republican presidential candidate is: Dewey 128, Taft 74, Stassen 62, Baldwin 19, MacArthur 8.</p>
<p>Dewey, Stassen, and Taft all have far more delegates than the numbers mentioned above. Spokesmen for Dewey and Taft each claimed that their presidential candidates could win at least 300 votes in the first ballot. Stassen's campaign headquarters claimed that he could get 340 votes in the first ballot and another 200 votes in the second ballot. However, this claim seems exaggerated. According to the rules of the Republican National Convention, each presidential candidate only needs a simple majority to be elected as a presidential nominee, and this year's simple majority is 548 votes.</p>
<h3>US Prepares to Recognize South Korean Government When the Time Is Right, Choice of Ambassador to South Korea Also Finalized</h3>

However, they revealed that Herston, currently serving as an assistant at the US Embassy in Norway, will soon succeed Krogstad as the US Consul in Seoul.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Seoul, 1st] The newly elected South Korean National Assembly decided this afternoon to propose the establishment of ten committees, with one representative from each province to participate in the drafting of the new constitution. Since all parties are right-wing, the composition of the committee will be allocated regardless of party affiliation.</p>
<h3>Columbia River Levee Breaks, US Flood Disaster Unprecedentedly Severe, US and Canadian Authorities Strive for Rescue Efforts</h3>
<p>[United Press International, Washington, 31st] President Truman today declared the flood-stricken areas of Oregon, Washington, and Idaho as disaster areas and ordered the use of wartime surplus materials for relief. The American Red Cross has allocated $52,000 to the disaster area.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Portland, Oregon, 1st] The US Pacific Northwest coast and Canada are tonight struggling to resist the floodwaters of the Columbia River. Upstream areas have been damaged, but the flood continues to surge downstream to densely populated areas. The total loss is impossible to estimate. According to the Red Cross, the number of victims has reached 45,000 and approximately 10,000 homes have been destroyed.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Portland, Oregon, 1st] Another levee on the Columbia River north of Portland broke late on the 31st, and the river flooded, rushing towards the Portland racetrack worth $1.5 million. Fortunately, residents in this new disaster area had been evacuated in advance, and 800 horses were also moved from the stables. At the same time, 5,000 residents in two cities in southwestern Washington State have abandoned their homes due to the threat of flooding. The disaster situation downstream of the Columbia River is unprecedentedly severe, and residents along the levee for 120 miles from near Portland to the Pacific Ocean have all been ordered to evacuate. According to the Army Corps of Engineers, except for able-bodied men and troops engaged in levee protection work, the rest have been evacuated. The Columbia River and its downstream tributaries continue to rise, and all 1,000 residents of Woodley, 30 miles north of Portland, have evacuated to safe locations. Approximately 4,000 residents of Kelso, Washington, have fled from the lower part of the city. The Cowlitz River is also rising, and 9,000 residents are working hard with the help of a team to try to protect their homes in the danger zone. The 30-foot-high head of the Columbia River is still hours away, but parts of the coasts of Washington and Bradlon have been flooded. More than 300 miles to the north, in British Columbia, Canada, the Fraser River also breached in one place, isolating 2,000 residents of Matsqui and Rosedale from the outside world. Premier Johnson has declared a state of emergency in the disaster area and authorized the Canadian Army to deploy troops if necessary.</p>
<h3>Australian Government Opposes Japanese Immigration to Pacific Islands</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Canberra, 31st] An Australian government spokesman said that Australia will use all means to oppose Japanese immigration to the Pacific.

<h3>British Cabinet Implements Partial Reorganization, Dalton Re-enters Cabinet to Assist Prime Minister in Handling Special Affairs</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 31st] It was officially announced that former Chancellor of the Exchequer Dalton has re-entered the Cabinet, succeeding Lord Pakenham as Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster. (Note: Dalton was forced to resign last year for leaking the budget.) Lord Pakenham has been transferred to the post of Minister of Civil Aviation, succeeding the resigning Lord Nathan. The Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster is like a minister without portfolio, not responsible for any specific department, but assists the Cabinet in its general work and may be ordered by the Prime Minister to perform special duties at any time.</p>
<p>The position was originally not a member of the Cabinet, but after Dalton's appointment, Dalton will serve as a member of the Cabinet. When Lord Pakenham held the position, he was responsible for the affairs of the British occupied zones of Germany and Austria. Now that the affairs of the occupied zones of Germany and Austria have been transferred to Foreign Secretary Bevin for general responsibility, they will no longer be Dalton's task. The annual salary of the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster was originally £3,000, but since Dalton is a member of the Cabinet, his annual salary is £5,000. Prime Minister Attlee intends to assign Dalton to any kind of duty, but it has not yet been decided. It is said that the economic affairs currently handled by Chancellor of the Exchequer Cripps will not be changed for the time being. After Dalton enters the Cabinet, the number of Cabinet members has increased from 17 to 18.</p>

<h3>Executive Yuan Allocates Funds for Permanent Flood Control Project, Public Works Bureau Aims to Start Construction in Mid-July and Complete It in Six Months, Funding for Dike Project in Jiangsu Province Also Approved, Allocating 200 Billion</h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] According to reliable information obtained by reporters yesterday from relevant parties: the Executive Yuan's Committee for Handling US Aid to China Relief Supplies has approved the allocation of US$320,000 for the city's permanent flood control project. The funds are extracted from the proceeds from the sale of US relief rice, which, converted at the previous exchange rate, is approximately 100 billion national currency, and will be allocated in installments. The first installment of 15 billion yuan was allocated to the city government in May, the second installment of 40 billion yuan will be allocated this month, and the third installment of 45 billion yuan will be issued after construction begins. The Seawall Engineering Committee of the Public Works Bureau is scheduled to conduct public bidding within the month. In order to prevent price increases of construction materials, all the funds from the first installment will be used to purchase materials first. This large-scale flood control project is scheduled to start construction in mid-July and will be completed within six months.</p>
<p>It is understood that the city's seawalls, bounded by the Huangpu River, are divided into east and west dikes. The east dike is 15.26 kilometers long and the west dike is 16.62 kilometers long. Due to the impact of the war, they have been in disrepair for many years, and have been eroded by seawater, resulting in numerous breaches. After the restoration, the Public Works Bureau realized that the situation was very critical and decided to carry out emergency repairs first. Since the winter of the 34th year of the Republic of China (1945), measurement work has been carried out. In the spring of the 35th year of the Republic of China (1946), the city government allocated funds, and the Executive Headquarters provided trucks to start construction and first repaired more than ten breaches south of the seaside bath. In the 36th year of the Republic of China (1947), the Executive Yuan was requested to allocate 1 billion yuan in funding. By the end of May of this year, the preliminary revetment project had been completed one after another, totaling more than 60 billion yuan.</p>
<p>Good News Arrives, City Government Pleased</p>
<p>The city government, considering that the dredging of the seawalls and the protection of the beach and revetment are equally important, and that the previous construction was purely emergency repairs, which were only temporary measures. To ensure the safety of the dike, the construction of the beach protection project is still needed to achieve a permanent solution. The Public Works Bureau was instructed to quickly formulate a specific plan for the flood control project and wait for the opportunity to implement it. The Seawall Engineering Committee rushed to complete it at the end of last lunar year. Starting this spring, Zhao Zukang, Director of the Public Works Bureau, and Zhu Guoxi, Director of the Structural Department, traveled tirelessly on the Nanjing-Shanghai route to fully promote its implementation. At that time, although the Executive Yuan considered the flood control project to be extremely important, it was unable to bear the cost of such a large-scale project due to the government's economic difficulties. Later, due to the smooth distribution and sale of US relief rice in China, it was approved to allocate funds from the proceeds from the sale of rice. The Ministry of Water Resources will allocate the first installment of funds. When the good news arrived a few days ago, the city government was very pleased, and the Public Works Bureau is currently busy preparing for the seawall project.</p>
<p>The Project is Divided into Four Parts</p>
<p>According to reporter inquiries: the permanent flood control and beach protection project is divided into the following four parts: (1) New reinforced concrete retaining wall project, 1,000 meters long. (2) Renovation of pile and stone seawall project, 2,000 meters long. (3) Repair of old rubble retaining wall and rubble beach protection project, more than 1,000 meters long. (4) Construction of twelve bamboo drainage arrows for the dike protection.

<h3>Speaker Urges Citizens to Reflect on US Support for Japan, Do Not Just Criticize, Should Rely on Self-Reliance</h3>
<p>City Council Speaker Pan Gongzhan issued a statement yesterday on the issue of US support for Japan, advocating that the United States should focus on strengthening aid to China as the core of its Far East policy. The general idea is: In the current environment, instead of merely criticizing the United States for supporting Japan, we should first strive to reinvigorate ourselves, unite, and exert the power of total war to quell the communist rebellion as soon as possible, so that our country can become a major stabilizing force in the Far East. Our policy towards Japan has always been magnanimous, but it has its limits. If the United States single-mindedly supports Japan, causing the Japanese militarists and zaibatsu to attempt to take the opportunity to rise again, it will inevitably be opposed by us, and at the same time, we, as a member of the Allied forces, have the right to appeal to the United States at this time. However, we also have something to reflect on, that is, before and after the War of Resistance, the United States originally intended to actively support our country and make it a stabilizing force in the Far East. Unfortunately, in the past two years, the communist bandits have rebelled and resorted to armed force to seize power, causing the domestic political and economic situation to deteriorate, and the international status has also been greatly affected. The "anti-American" movement that is generally seen today is also secretly instigated by these traitors who use force to harm the country. US Consul General in Shanghai, Cabot, said in his speech commemorating US Memorial Day: "Those who shout the slogans of anti-American and pro-Japanese in China today have obviously forgotten that China's most affluent Northeast Nine Provinces are struggling to survive in the clutches of new imperialists. This statement is enough to alert the people of the country. At present, the United States occupies and controls Japan and must support Japan's post-war economy, which is about to collapse. It is a heavy burden. Therefore, it may not be unforgivable to allow the Japanese economy to recover slightly in order to reduce the US economic burden on Japan, but from a long-term perspective, we must also point out that some people in the United States, if they are paralyzed by flattery from Japan and excessively support Japan, will eventually form a dangerous policy, and will eventually suffer the consequences. I still remember that when Japan was undergoing the Meiji Restoration, Britain had single-handedly supported it, and the United States followed suit, but Japan still rejected Britain and the United States, which eventually led to the Pearl Harbor incident. Therefore, I deeply hope that far-sighted politicians in the United States can face reality, look to the future, recognize the crisis, and not repeat the mistakes. Moreover, China and the United States have a long history of friendship. If the United States wants to maintain world peace, it can only stabilize the Far East by strengthening aid to China. At the same time, I sincerely hope that compatriots across the country will not just criticize the United States for supporting Japan, but must rely on self-reliance, strive to quell the rebellion and build the country, so that we can become a stabilizing force in the Far East.</p>
<h3>Upper Court Tears Down Manga, Invites All Sectors to Inspect Today, Reveal Conspiracy Truth</h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] According to the Shanghai Municipal Government Information Office yesterday: a group of professional students at the Shanghai Law School on Jiangwan Road launched an exhibition of current affairs cartoons to celebrate the inauguration of the new president, Chu Fengyi, and the 20th anniversary of the appointment of Qian Xin as a member of the school board. This deeply dissatisfied the majority of students at the school, resulting in a melee. In addition to the professional students who hosted the cartoon exhibition and the perpetrators of the beating being transferred to the Special Court by the Police Bureau for investigation, the authorities decided to invite university presidents, executive directors of the Municipal Education Association, speakers and secretaries-general of the Municipal Council, the press, and responsible persons of relevant groups to a public viewing in the Municipal Government Conference Room at 4:00 pm today to clarify the truth, in order to make all sectors of society understand the conspiracy of a small number of professional students at the Shanghai Law School being instigated by the communist party. Examples of cartoons that were torn down by patriotic students at the school at the time include: depicting "the President and Vice President walking towards Yuan Shikai's tomb," "the Chinese Emperor kneeling to the Americans to present the New Twenty-One Demands," and other posters and various reactionary slogans.</p>
<h3>Authorities Clarify Index Issues, Prices Adopted are Averages, High or Low Does Not Depend on Number of Items</h3>
<p>Since the release of the employee cost of living index last month, some workers in the city have found suspicion about the compilation of the worker index, believing that: (1) The May index increased by 29% compared to April, and anyone's intuition feels that the price increase in May far exceeded 29%. (2) The worker index has been declining month by month. The reason is that the percentage of rice in the worker index is heavier than the employee index, and the employee index includes items such as silk, wool, movies, and fruits, while the worker index lacks all of these items. In fact, these items are also necessary for workers' lives. Wu Kaixian, Director of the Social Affairs Bureau, made a statement to the Dagong Daily reporter yesterday, explaining that: (1) The prices used to compile the index are the average prices for each month, not the prices at the end of the month. When prices are rising sharply, the price increase at the end of the month is often greater than the average increase, and most people's intuition is based on the end-of-month percentage, which leads to the misunderstanding that the index is inaccurate. (2) The cost of living index is a weighted average of various prices. The prices of various goods in each month have risen very high, while the prices of some goods have risen very little. If the price increase of an item is not high, its weight is larger, and the index increase rate will be reduced, but when this item increases sharply, the index increase rate will definitely increase. We should not suspect it based on the situation in the past one or two months. (3) The index compilation method is based on objective facts obtained from worker family budget surveys, which have been sorted and analyzed. The selected item weights and average household size have their scientific basis and cannot be changed arbitrarily. (4) The level of the index does not depend on the number of items. A large number of items does not necessarily mean a high index, and a small number of items does not necessarily mean a low index. For example, the employee index has more items, but the May index is still lower than the worker index. (5) From the standpoint of the index, the employee index should not be lower than the worker index. The reason why it is currently lower is entirely due to the fact that the price fluctuations of various goods are not equal to the base period. Therefore, if the prices of various items return to normal, there should be no difference between employees and workers. The moderate increase in workers' cost of living is a symbol of prices gradually returning to normal. (6) In fact, although the worker index increased by a percentage lower than the employee cost of living, the reason is that the worker index in April was higher. If we observe the degree of increase based on the base period, the worker index is still 11,000 times higher than the employee index.</p>
<p>Trade Union Explains that the Index is Accurate</p>
<p>Yesterday, reports stated that various trade unions expressed dissatisfaction with the May index and that the compilation method should be considered. A reporter from Dagong Daily specifically visited Zhang Zhusan, the person in charge of the Cost of Living Index Research Association of the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions, to inquire about the actual situation of the compilation of the worker cost of living index in May. According to Zhang: (1) The compilation of the index by the Federation of Trade Unions is based entirely on the weekly retail prices provided by the survey communication network of each trade union. This original form cannot be changed by anyone, and the trade union can check it at any time. (2) The formula and units for calculating the index by the Federation of Trade Unions are all handled in accordance with the regulations of the Municipal Statistical Office. (3) The rice, oil, coal, and sugar in the worker cost of living index are calculated based on the allocation price of the Food Bureau. (4) The price of goods in May was in a state of decline in the third week, so when calculating the index, the average price of the increase and decrease must be used as the basis. (5) The rent in the index is based on the 7,000 to 9,000 times passed by the Municipal Council, and no one has the right to change it. (6) The reason why the employee index has a higher rate of increase than the worker index is due to the different living standards and consumer goods, and no one can deliberately lower it. Zhang also said, "The statistical index is an extremely scientific work. I sincerely hope that all trade unions can study the original prices of various items, and they will know that it is accurate."</p>
<p>The Garrison Command's Investigation Department received a secret report a month ago, learning that Zhang Nu, "Lieutenant General," the deputy commander of the communist army, was recently ordered to come to Shanghai to plan the destruction of warehouses, promote student movements, and obtain intelligence. With the approval of Commander Xuan, Zhang Nu was arrested on the evening of the 12th of last month. After strict interrogation, Xu Jiemin, the person in charge of the communist Shanghai Liaison Station, Fan Zhengchang, the deputy director of the communist Shanghai Liaison Station, Liu Yiqiu, the major general director of the Communist Military Central China Region Intelligence Service stationed in Nanjing and Shanghai, Fang Shilin, who was in charge of student movement work, as well as Zhu Yintian, Yang Xuedao, Zhu Yinqi, Tang Zhenbing, and other 14 people were arrested. They are still being interrogated by the Garrison Command and will be transferred to the Special Court for strict handling within days.</p>

<h3>Maintaining Over Two Hundred Orphans, Bethany Seeks Donations to Expand Site and Build New House</h3>
<p>Since its establishment six years ago, the Bethany Orphanage has accommodated more than 200 orphans. Recently, due to the issue of property ownership, the other party notified them to relocate within a limited time. Reverend Qian Tuan, the person in charge of Bethany, was quite discouraged by this blow. Upon hearing the news, people from all walks of life generally believed that Reverend Qian had achieved remarkable results in handling the education and upbringing of orphans over the years. If it were to suddenly stop because of this, it would be a pity. Moreover, the problem would be even more serious if more than 200 orphans were displaced. Therefore, they all expressed sympathy for Bethany's situation and were willing to provide all assistance to ensure that this well-established childcare undertaking would not be interrupted. Encouraged by all parties, the Bethany Standing Committee has resolved by the Board of Directors to expand the site and build a new house. It will launch a fundraising campaign from all walks of life starting today, with a tentative target of 150 billion yuan, for a period of one month, and has entrusted the city's major newspapers to collect donations on its behalf, hoping to achieve the planned goal within a similar period.</p>

<h3>Goods Needed for Public Utilities Should Adopt Preferential Exchange Settlement Methods: President Yu Expresses Principal Acceptability to Speaker's Proposal</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] Speaker Pan of the Municipal Council visited the newly appointed Governor of the Central Bank, Yu Hongjun, at the Central Bank on the morning of May 31 to exchange views on the government's improvement of foreign exchange management and the adoption of the foreign exchange settlement certificate method.</p>
<p>According to what Speaker Pan told reporters at the Municipal Council yesterday: the content of the discussion focused on the foreign exchange issues required by various public utilities. Speaker Pan said: People cannot survive without water and fire. Public utilities are not only the source of water and fire needed for people's daily lives, but also the driving force of general industrial production. This phenomenon is particularly prominent in major cities, so the cost of public utilities has a great impact on the cost of general industrial manufactured goods and the people's livelihood. Its importance is no less than that of raw materials for food and clothing such as rice, wheat, fertilizer, and cotton. In order to stabilize the prices of food and clothing, the government has stipulated in the implementation measures for the foreign exchange settlement certificate that for the import of rice, wheat, flour, feed, cotton, and other purposes approved by the government, a settlement certificate must be paid. In other words, the import of the above-mentioned items is still supplied with foreign exchange by the Central Bank at the official exchange rate, which can avoid the loss of independently purchasing foreign exchange at a premium, thereby reducing costs. I believe that in order to achieve the expected effect of the new foreign exchange policy in stabilizing prices, the machines, gasoline, diesel, and chemicals used by water plants, etc., that are required by various public utilities to be ordered from abroad should also adopt the same preferential treatment methods as rice, wheat, and flour. This suggestion does not conflict with the new policy promulgated by the government, because the implementation measures for the foreign exchange settlement certificate stipulate that items approved by the government for use can enjoy foreign exchange supplied by the Central Bank.</p>
<p>Speaker Pan also said: Governor Yu stated that the above suggestion is acceptable in principle, but the implementation method must be discussed in detail with relevant parties and approved by the government before it can be announced and implemented. At the Fifth General Assembly, this council had previously decided to recommend that the government adopt effective measures to fundamentally stabilize prices in order to alleviate people's suffering and stabilize people's hearts, and to set a fairly stable allocation or exchange settlement price for the materials and fuels necessary for various public utilities within three months in order to reduce the factors of price increases in the business. However, the government has not yet adopted and implemented it. The Public Utilities Investigation Committee of this council has decided to petition the central competent ministries on this issue. Now that the government's foreign exchange policy has undergone new changes, I will report the results of yesterday's discussion with Governor Yu to this council. If it is approved by a majority, this new suggestion will be used as the basis for regular talks with the Central Bank, and then formally make specific suggestions to the government, in order to reduce the factors of price increases in public utilities and stabilize prices.</p>
<h3>Wu Kaixian Hosts People from the Industrial Sector to Discuss the Establishment of the Municipal Industrial Association</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] Director of the Social Affairs Bureau, Wu Kaixian, hosted people from the industrial sector of the city at a tea party at the Lido Garden at 3:00 PM yesterday to discuss the establishment of the Municipal Industrial Association. Those attending included Speaker Pan, Chairman Fang, Deputy Minister of the Central Ministry of Agriculture and Industry Lu Jingshi, Section Chief of the Ministry of Social Affairs Li Shiheng, and responsible persons from various industrial trade associations, including Du Yuesheng, Yang Guanbei, Shu Yunjang, Liu Hongsheng, Hu Xiyuan, and Rong Hongyuan, Xu Xueyu, and more than fifty others. Director Wu said in his speech that the Ministry of Social Affairs hoped to establish the Municipal Industrial Association in May of this year, but so far only thirty-eight industrial trade associations in the city have completed the reorganization. In order to comply with the order of the Ministry of Social Affairs to prepare for establishment as soon as possible, the Social Affairs Bureau, in accordance with the provisions of Article 51 of the Industrial Association Law, has designated a number of units as initiators. Based on the qualifications, history, and capabilities of the leaders of various industries, a total of forty-nine people, including Du Yuesheng, Wu Yunju, Liu Hongsheng, Shu Yunzhang, Hu Xiyuan, Hu Boxiang, Tian Heqing, and Guo Yongxi, have been designated to serve as preparatory committee members. Therefore, today's tea party is also a meeting of all the initiators of the Municipal Industrial Association.</p>
<p>Tasks of the Preparatory Committee</p>
<p>The tasks that the Social Affairs Bureau hopes the preparatory committee will undertake are: (1) to investigate the detailed situation of the same industry factories in the district, (2) to raise preparatory funds, (3) to formulate standards for paying membership fees and annual dues, (4) to determine the date of the establishment conference, which must not be later than two months after the establishment, (5) to review the qualifications of representatives attending the establishment conference, and (6) to draft the articles of association.</p>
<p>Afterwards, Li Shiheng, Section Chief of the Ministry of Social Affairs, who came to Shanghai to guide the preparations, said in his speech: Shanghai's industry accounts for 70% of the country's total. He deeply hoped that the organization of the Municipal Industrial Association this time could serve as a model for the whole country, and that when the National Federation of Industries is organized in the future, the Shanghai Industrial Association will also be the center. Speaker Pan said in his speech that he hoped that after the establishment of the Municipal Industrial Association, it would be able to exert the new power of cooperation and unity to overcome this difficult period. Chairman Fang of the Kuomintang said: Heaven helps those who help themselves. The industrial sector should step up its efforts to unite and improve production so that the allied countries can recognize that our country is working hard and thus provide more assistance to China. At the same time, he also hoped that the government after the implementation of the constitution can truly understand the current difficulties of the industrial sector and help it solve them.</p>
<p>Opening of the Preparatory Meeting</p>
<p>The tea party convened by Director Wu came to an end. The first plenary meeting of the Preparatory Committee of the Municipal Industrial Association was held.

<h3>"False Phoenix and Empty Dragon" to Produce English Copy, Dubbing to Be Completed Next Week, To Be Transported to England and America for Public Screening</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] The film "False Phoenix and Empty Dragon", which once caused a sensation due to the "rectification" dispute of barbers, set the highest box office record for domestic films last year. Therefore, it aroused the strong interest of British and American film authorities, who repeatedly wrote to Wenhua Company, requesting that the film be produced in an English copy and transported to England and America for screening. Wenhua believes that this move is a pioneering initiative for domestic films. In order to show its solemnity, the film's director Huang Zuolin first translated the original lyrics into an English dialogue book and brought it to London at the beginning of the year along with the original Mandarin copy of the film to solicit opinions from all parties in the United Kingdom. As a result, it won unanimous praise, believing that the joys and sorrows of men and women produced by the chaotic times in the plot, and the internal sense of humor, will definitely be widely accepted by British and American people. They especially praised the English translation of the dialogue as a vivid work, so they suggested that instead of adding English subtitles, it would be easier to arouse the interest of British and American audiences to produce an English copy. At this point, Wenhua officially decided to give it a try. Huang Zuolin was still in charge of the matter, and the English film title was set as "The Barber Takes a Wife." Four people with profound English and stage experience were hired to start dubbing in April. The shots of the original film were not cut, only the pronunciation part was completely replaced. Up to now, only the music part needs to be completed, and it is expected to be completed entirely within the next week. After a domestic trial screening, it will be transported to the United States first, and then to England for public screening in sequence.</p>
<p>Dubbing Cast</p>
<p>As for the dubbing cast, Miss Li Suiyin played Fan Ruhua in the film, Ma Jiaxun played "No. 3", Kuba played "No. 7", and Huang Zuolin's wife, Danny, played Chen Guofang. Among them, Li is a Cantonese and a sports athlete at Shanghai Sports Academy. Ma is currently a reporter for the English-language Dagong Evening News and once starred in the English drama "Wang Baochuan" in Tianjin. Gu also participated in stage plays in the United States. Danny was Huang's classmate at Cambridge University in England when he was studying drama. The four have excellent English and stage experience. This time, they are assigned to dub the four leading roles in the film. Under Huang's guidance for a month, they have worked hard to study the tone, pronunciation, and emotions, so the final performance is extremely outstanding. Currently, there are also two films, "Six Records of a Floating Life" and "Butterfly Dream", that will also be produced in English-dubbed copies after "False Phoenix and Empty Dragon", so in the future, domestic film art will surely be able to shine brightly abroad due to the continuous export.</p>
<h3>Ward Chief and Ward Secretary Suspected of Embezzlement</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] Ward Chief Zhang Juyang and Ward Secretary Zhang Yilun of the Eighth Ward in Yangshupu District were secretly reported by the ward residents for falsely reporting household registrations, fraudulently claiming ration cards, and suspected of colluding in embezzlement. After Zheng Guanying, the supervisor sent by the Civil Affairs Bureau, went to conduct a secret investigation, he found two points of suspicion: (1) According to the statistics for April, there were a total of 4,029 people in the ward, with 33 people reporting in and 1,270 people reporting out. It is highly suspicious why the household registration changes are so drastic. After investigation, it was found that Zhang Yilun was transferred to the District Office on April 8. Fearing that the matter would be revealed, he reported a large number of previously falsely reported household registrations. (2) For the rice certificates issued by the District Branch Office, because Zhang Yilun was transferred away, there were 1,079 more large-port rice tickets and 24 more small-port tickets, for a total of 1,103 more. The Civil Affairs Bureau, believing that Zhang Juyang and Zhang Yilun were jointly suspected of embezzlement, transferred the case to the District Procuratorate for investigation yesterday.</p>

Song is 44 years old, from Jimo, Shandong, and his Shanghai address is 991 Yingshi Road. Song Pengling is his younger brother.</p>
<p>Black Market Gold and Cash Seized in Two Places</p>
<p>According to a tip, the Shanghai Office of the Special Office of the Ministry of Economic Affairs reported that Liang and others in Shunli Tobacco Company on Hankou Road and Zhongfa Bank Company on Zhongzheng East Road were engaged in gold and cash black market activities. After consulting with the Economic Team of the Garrison Headquarters, personnel were dispatched to investigate and arrest. On the spot, 21 taels, 9 mace, and 9 fen of gold and 26 silver dollars were found in Shunli Tobacco Company, and three suspects, Dai Aiwei, Yao Jiuxue, and Zhu Qiyu, were arrested. In the Xiexin Bank Company No. 105 of the Zhongfa Bank Company, three large bars of gold, 2.8 billion yuan in suspected checks, and 230 million yuan in yarn, and one suspect, Zhang Zhengrong, were found.

<h3>Two Gold Vendors Arrested by Garrison Headquarters</h3>
<p>The Economic Team of the Garrison Headquarters investigated and dealt with a case of gold and cash black market yesterday, arresting Chen Guang'an (resident of 301 Fengyang Road), Yuan Ruigen (person in charge of Zhijiang Candy Company, Ningbo Road), and several others. Chen and Yuan jointly transported gold and cash from Hangzhou and sold them on the black market. Recently, fifty bars of gold were transported from Hangzhou and have been sold to various customers. When the personnel of the team went to investigate yesterday, only 12 taels of gold and more than 400 million yuan in legal tender were seized, as well as many pieces of evidence. It is reported that the personnel of the team are still tracking down customers who purchased black market gold.</p>
<h3>Photo Studio Acquires Gold Bars: Investigators Disguise to Crack the Case</h3>
<p>The Economic Section of the Inspection Department of the Garrison Headquarters received a report that Jinxing Photo Studio, No. 9, Lane 567, Linsen Middle Road, was suspected of operating a black market for gold and cash. The department dispatched personnel disguised as customers to the photo studio with three large gold bars, claiming to sell them. Another group of personnel lurked outside. Yu Hailiang, the accountant of Jinxing Photo Studio, came forward to negotiate, stating that 30 taels of gold would be valued at 1,754 million yuan, and a Xinhua Bank check was issued at that time. At this point, the investigators had human and physical evidence, so they made the arrest. Unexpectedly, the three gold bars could not be found anywhere. After two hours of searching, they were found in the garbage pile on the drying platform on the third floor of the conversation room. It was also found that the check issued by the photo studio had incomplete seals and insufficient funds, so it was not only guilty of privately operating a black market for gold and cash, but also had a serious suspicion of fraud.</p>
<h3>Three Companies Suspected of Foreign Exchange Arbitrage: Police Investigation Confirmed and Submitted for Approval</h3>

<h3>Textile Industry Opposes the Tender Sale of Japanese Goods Wool Fabrics</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] Since the news that the China Trust Bureau decided to tender sale of Japanese goods, wool fabrics was released, the Shanghai Wool Textile Industry Association has expressed strong opposition. The association officially sent a letter to the Barter Department of the China Trust Bureau yesterday, requesting that the tender sale be suspended and that a reasonable disposal be adopted instead. The reason for its position is that Japanese goods, wool fabrics, will be widely sold in the country as a result, which will not only endanger the national industry, but also find a way out for Japanese goods in the country before the treaty is signed and the compensation is fully paid, which is also a violation of the prohibition.</p>
<h3>American Employee of Air Transport Brigade Violently Beats Driver to Death</h3>

Because Sun did not understand English, he mistakenly drove to the Huizhong, Jinmen, and Paramount Hotels, causing Allen to become angry. When getting out of the car, he punched and kicked Sun. When the patrol police arrived, Sun had already been injured and fell to the ground. Sun was then sent to the First Hospital of the Red Cross for treatment, and Allen was taken to the bureau for questioning. That night, the US Consulate learned of the situation and sent personnel to bail Allen out. It is now learned that Sun's injury was in the brain and he died yesterday afternoon, so the case will be transferred to the District Procuratorate for investigation on the charge of intentional injury causing death.</p>

According to the investigation after the incident, male worker Ji Linbao and his wife, Hu Zhenbao, both worked in the factory.

<h3>The People's Livelihood Adjustment Committee Stops Selling, Cancels Price Limits - Rice Sales Return to Free Trade - Market Transactions are Normal, Indica and Japonica Varieties Both Weaken</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] In coordination with the overall financial and economic policy, the government's sale of rice, originally supplied in both the northern and southern markets, has been stopped as of yesterday, and free trade has been restored, with price limits canceled. Market transactions have returned to normal, and over-the-counter transactions have disappeared. Yesterday, the rice market reported a weakening of rice prices from the producing areas, due to the limited adjustment of the comprehensive rice allocation price for June, coupled with the impact of the inability to use checks on that day, resulting in tight money and a weakening of public confidence. Therefore, the asking prices generally fell, with each variety decreasing by about 100,000 compared to the previous day.</p>
<p>Ren Xianqun, the chairman of the Shanghai Municipal People's Livelihood Adjustment Committee, inspected the northern and southern rice markets yesterday morning. According to him, the market response was quite good after the adjustment of the rice allocation price for June to 500,000 yuan per 15 shi jin. Since the market price has stabilized, government supply is unnecessary, and he agreed with Mayor Wu to stop the supply, open up price limits, and restore free purchase and sale. He deeply hopes that this will dredge the source and stabilize grain prices.</p>
<p>Flour prices have fallen sharply due to the decline in rice prices and the tight money situation after checks were disallowed. In addition, the new wheat from various places is entering the market one after another, and those holding goods cannot help but soften their stance, with many having the intention of selling off. Bingchuan flour fell to 1.96 million, within 2 million. Lao Che retreated to 2 million, a decrease of 900,000. Hongfeng and Jiancheng decreased by 100,000 to 130,000 yuan, and the China National Relief and Rehabilitation Administration reduced the selling price of flour by 30,000 yuan, offering it at 2 million, but there were no buyers. Bran was a small amount of 10,000 yuan, and wheat opened at 2.8 million, a decrease of 100,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Due to fellow traders feeling that the silver has been extremely tight after checks were disallowed and that customer demand had waned, the trading of miscellaneous grains was sparse. High-quality soybeans were stable, with high-quality broad beans at 3.3 million yuan at the original price and mid-grade goods at 3.2 million yuan. Corn sales decreased, falling by more than 200,000. Red sorghum has not yet opened, the price of new Yuan wheat has dropped by more than 150,000 yuan, and mung beans have fallen. The price of new Qingbai silkworm cocoons has fallen by 50,000 yuan, and sesame from Tianjin has a way out, so the price is reported to be stable and firm. Because the payment for raw peanuts has not been resolved, they have not opened.</p>
<p>Edible oil prices have seen both increases and decreases. Soybean oil has fallen while vegetable oil has remained firm. Qingdao Jiton vegetable oil is 18 million, and Jiangbei Jiton vegetable oil is up by 300,000 yuan, mainly because the arrival of goods is scarce and the prices at the producing areas are high. The price of soybean oil has fallen because the prices of all grains have fallen and public confidence is weak, with many retail investors spitting out their holdings. The price of Dayou soybean oil is 14.3 million yuan, and Changde soybean oil is 14.1 million yuan, each down by 600,000 to 700,000. Raw rapeseed oil and refined oil have all fallen, but Xiaojun sesame oil has risen by 500,000 yuan due to Tianjin traders. Although Shantou traders did not take much soybean cake, it ultimately fell by 50,000 to 60,000 yuan.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] The "Peace Fists," represented by Jardine Matheson &amp; Co., arrived in Shanghai from the United States yesterday, transporting 1,500 tons of foreign rice, totaling 33,400 bags, from San Francisco.</p>
<h3>Designated Banks Held a General Meeting Yesterday - Discussing New Exchange Settlement Methods - Four Opinions on Circular No. 134</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] The Shanghai Association of Designated Banks held a general meeting of its members at the Bank of China Building yesterday afternoon at 3 pm to discuss and resolve the technical problems caused by the new exchange settlement method. More than 30 representatives from designated banks, both Chinese and foreign, attended the meeting, with Span Shan, a representative from HSBC, serving as chairman. Deputy Governor Liu Gongyun and Deputy Director Shao Zhenhua attended to provide guidance.</p>
<p>After the meeting began, Central Bank Circular No. 134 was read and discussed in detail, article by article. When there were opinions, Liu Gongyun would explain them. As a result of the discussion, the meeting proposed four points: (1) Certificates of foreign exchange settlement for foreign exchange should be allowed to circulate and be traded freely. (2) Article 25 of the Circular stipulates that the daily foreign exchange balance of designated banks shall not exceed US$1,000, which is considered too strict. It is hoped that it will be raised to US$5,000. (3) Article 3 of the Circular stipulates that exporters must declare the quality, quantity, and foreign exchange value of goods to the designated bank. Only after confirming that there are no errors can the procedures be processed. According to this, this is a normal procedure for customs, and designated banks should not be responsible for it. The designated bank is responsible for the accuracy of credit. (4) The Central Bank should authorize designated banks to issue special exchange settlement certificates under certain circumstances. Liu Gongyun expressed acceptance of the first three points on the spot, and they will be revised after the method is completed. The fourth point is still under consideration. The meeting ended at 5:30 pm.</p>
<p>Remittance Issues Unresolved</p>
<p>The overseas remittance issue panel continued to meet, with representatives from nine banks, including Bank of China, Bank of Communications, Citibank, Chung Hing Bank, Postal Savings, Holland Bank, and China South Bank, participating. Chen Changtong chaired the meeting to discuss future overseas remittance prices and the handling of issues by designated banks. Representatives presented many opinions that were quite inconsistent. Due to time constraints, no conclusion was reached, and it was decided to hold another meeting today to continue the discussion.</p>
<p>Further news: Central Bank Deputy Director Shao Zhenhua told reporters yesterday that as of the day before yesterday, no exchange settlement certificates have been issued or traded. With the implementation of the new exchange settlement method, the responsibility of the Foreign Exchange Equilibrium Association will be expanded, and the association will assist the Central Bank in issuing and managing exchange settlement certificates. Regarding the price of exchange settlement certificates, Shao said that it is up to the import and export traders to freely decide through supply and demand relationships. In the future, foreign exchange brokers will only have the responsibility of facilitating transactions.</p>
<p>Central Bank Explains Meaning of Clauses</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] The Central Bank issued Circular No. 236 to designated banks yesterday, the general idea of which is: Article 28 of Circular No. 134 stipulates that importers must have an exchange settlement certificate of the same value when applying to buy foreign exchange. The meaning of "same value" refers to the fact that the difference between the value of an exchange settlement certificate and the value of an import license cannot exceed US$50 or its equivalent exchange value.</p>
<h3>Chengxi Spring Cocoons Hit the Market - 26 Million Per Dan</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Wuxi, 1st Day] This year's spring cocoons have appeared on the market, and various silk cocoon trading houses have decided to open and collect cocoons on the 3rd. However, the Cocoon Guidance Association stipulates that the cocoon price is 26 million per dan and will not be adjusted further. Those who violate this will be ordered to stop collecting cocoons. It is said that silk cocoon trading houses in Yi, Li, and Cheng counties have set the opening date for the 5th. Also, the news that silk money houses would not accept checks on that day has not been implemented.</p>
<p>[Jiangyin Telegraph] Seven silk cocoon trading houses in Chengyi have reported that they will open on approximately the 4th. New cocoons have now hit the market at a price of 30 million. High-quality cocoons in the southeast townships are unwilling to sell due to cost considerations, and it is expected that they will be close to 40 million.</p>
<h3>Prohibition of Check Redemption - Market Response is Good</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] The method of prohibiting same-day check redemption has been implemented since yesterday. Due to the inconvenience in deploying funds, the prices of various goods have seen a slight decline. Responsible personnel from the Gold Control Bureau indicated in the evening that the market response was good, and the number of check exchanges had decreased by nearly 60% compared to normal days, and the number of bounced checks had also decreased proportionally. The prohibition of same-day check redemption has more advantages than disadvantages. Customers with good credit can still enter into contracts with banks. This method will overcome difficulties and be strictly implemented, and bad checks will be severely punished. If there is a check returned from a redemption contract, the responsibility lies with the bank.</p>
<h3>The Shanghai Stock Market Turned Positive at the Close - Government Bonds and Unified Bonds Were All Weak</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Shanghai stock market suffered from various inconveniences due to the prohibition of check redemption, and the morning market was even more depressed, with a very bleak decline. It only gradually stabilized in the afternoon, the panic gradually subsided, and the market rebounded to a positive trend near the close.</p>
<p>In the early morning, public confidence was affected by the accumulation of bounced checks the day before, and the market was timid and weak. Yong Yarn opened at a low of 2,570 yuan, but the gray market was still high, rising to 2,610 yuan. Due to the restrictions on the use of check redemption and the rigid regulations on the settlement of securities transactions, the price fell to a low of 2,510 yuan. Although it once rose to 2,550 yuan, the yarn and flower traders sold off in large quantities, and the price fell again to a low of 2,465 yuan. The morning close was 2,485 yuan. Except for Tongyi, which rose slightly, matches, Huaxin, and Xinhua fell by 10%, Meiya, Jingfu, Xinguang, underwear, China Silk, and Commerce fell by 5%, and the rest fell slightly.</p>
<p>In the afternoon market, Yong Yarn opened at 2,520 yuan and gradually rose. The state-owned banks reported further purchases, and after 3 pm, the price rose to 2,610 yuan. The closing price was 2,610 yuan. Tongyi, Huafeng, matches, Xinguang, and Jingfu recovered sharply, and some treasury bonds also matured. Compared to the morning close, matches rose by 10%, Huafeng, Xinguang, Jingfu, Meiya, China-France, Qinxing, Commerce, and Xinhua each rose by 5%, and the rest rose slightly. In the gray market, the prices of unlisted bank stocks fell by 5%, and the rest were flat.</p>
<p>Treasury Bonds</p>
<p>Yesterday's trading was still sluggish, and the maturity period was shortened, resulting in a small increase. Type A bonds were 73.1 to 73.4 yuan, and Type B bonds were 74.9 to 74 yuan, with minimal fluctuations.</p>
<p>Government Bonds</p>
<p>Yesterday reported a decline. Tongbing opened at 280,000 and fell to 248,000 yuan before stabilizing slightly. The trading volume was about 4 million, which was 27,000 lower than the previous close for Types A and B, 33,000 lower for Type C, 30,000 lower for Type D, and a small amount of 32,000 lower for Type E.</p>
<p>Foreign Stocks</p>
<p>Yesterday's trading was still sluggish, and securities traders sold off slightly. Due to objective restrictions, normal performance was impossible. Yisha opened at 4.2 million in the morning and reached a high price of 4.35 million before leveling off slightly. As a result, Yeguang and shipping stocks were flat compared to the previous close, paper stocks rose slightly, and the rest fell slightly.</p>
<h3>Treasury Bond Principal and Interest Repayment</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] The first batch of one-month short-term treasury bonds matured the day before yesterday, and the National Bank has fully repaid the principal and interest. The principal totaled 556.43 billion yuan, and the interest totaled more than 22 billion yuan. There will be maturities every month thereafter, but the amount will not be large.</p>
<h3>Tight Monetary Conditions - Banks and Bureaus Turned From Net Borrowers to Net Lenders</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the local monetary conditions in Shanghai were tight due to the impact of the prohibition of same-day check redemption, and overnight interest rates were high, exceeding 30%. However, in the check exchange between banks and money houses, the four banks, two bureaus, and one treasury reversed the trend of continuous large net borrowing since January, with a slight net lending, totaling 112.9 billion.

<h3>Market Conditions in Various Regions</h3>
<p>Wuxi</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Wuxi, 1st Day] Amidst the cocoon season, the prices of various goods are sluggish and hovering in a weak state.

<p>Suzhou</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Suzhou, 1st Day] Rice prices in Suzhou continued to fall today. The market arrival is very strong, and the owners are nervous. The market trend has entered the right track. Rough japonica is 5.85 million yuan, white japonica is 6.56 million yuan, and white rice sold at the door is 6.6 million yuan, with each grade being 100,000 yuan short.</p>
<p>Zhenjiang</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Zhenjiang, 1st Day] The Provincial Field and Grain Office believes that the grain source is gradually smooth, and rice prices in Su and Xi have also fallen back, but the rice price in Zhenjiang has risen to 7.2 million yuan, which is obviously price gouging by grain merchants, which is extremely hateful. The office has specially ordered the Zhen County government to send important officials to the rice market every day to closely monitor the opening price, and if they find that the opening price is unreasonable, they will immediately ban it.</p>
<p>Mingguang</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Mingguang, 1st Day] New wheat in this county has hit the market, with top-quality wheat selling for 5 million yuan and Paulownia wheat selling for 4 million yuan.</p>
<h3>The Export Management Committee Will Announce Today - Methods to Improve Trade Control</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] After the implementation of the exchange settlement certificate system, the pig bristle industry has already applied for exchange settlement with a designated bank yesterday. However, the certificate obtained by the household has not been sold because there is no target for absorption. Although the official trading of the certificate has not yet opened, it is rumored that the shout price in the market is between 500,000 and 600,000 yuan in national currency per US dollar. After adding the foreign exchange rate of 474,000 yuan, the total is about 1 million yuan, which is slightly lower than the black market, but the difference is not too far, so the situation of China's export industry today is bound to improve. The Export Management Committee continued to meet yesterday to discuss the new trade policy in the future and may announce it today. It is generally speculated that the import quota in the future will also be relaxed, and foreign exchange with own funds will be opened conditionally in order to import production equipment in large quantities. The government will reduce the number of foreign exchange supplied at market prices and hope to increase imports by increasing exports to meet the needs of the industrial and import sectors.</p>
<h3>The Yarn and Cloth Market is Consistently Weak</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the cotton yarn market was characterized by tight monetary conditions and considerable public hesitation due to the prohibition of same-day check redemption. Transactions were scarce, and the market trend was soft. 42-count blue-printed fine yarn fell by 10 million as soon as it opened. Later, due to sporadic purchases by customers, it recovered by about 3 million. When the industry was close to the close, the funds were tight, and they began to sell off. Customers and retail investors also came to resell, and the situation fell to 288.8 million yuan, a decrease of 12 million yuan from the previous day. The other counts of coarse and fine yarn also fell by 5.6 million to 10 million.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the cotton cloth market saw a lot of selling by the industry, but customers entered the market when prices were low. The dyeing factories supplied the textile construction county brand, and there was little movement in the market. The market trend was tortuous and downstream. The morning opening price of 12-pound Longtou fine cloth was a small increase of 150,000 yuan, at 6.75 million. Later, due to the fact that the cloth stores sold a lot, the market fell again to 6.58 million yuan. Near the close, it was heard that remittances from North China had arrived in Shanghai, and the North traders took advantage of the small gains, and since the yarn price was stable, the price rose to 6.64 million yuan to compensate for the floating air, and the closing price continued to fall by 260,000 yuan compared with the previous day. Other fine cloth, fine twill cloth, gray cloth, bleached cloth, and serge-colored cloth, linsey-woolsey, and other fabrics all fell sharply.</p>
<h3>The Audit Office of the National Bank Approved the Interest Rates of Banks and Money Houses</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] The Audit Office of the Central Bank has recently approved the interest rates of banks and money houses, effective from June 1st. The loan rate is 8.5 yuan per 1,000 yuan; the interbank lending rate is 6.5 yuan per 1,000 yuan. The bank's rediscount and lending rates yesterday were: (1) The rediscount rate was 8 yuan per 1,000 yuan, (2) The overnight lending rate was 6 yuan per 1,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>Export Materials Rise - Guangzhou Market is Active</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Guangzhou, 1st Day] Since the announcement of the exchange settlement certificate method, the response from the local market has been exceptionally good. Those who have foreign exchange holdings are selling them off to obtain export materials. Therefore, the Hong Kong dollar once fell to 1,950, and export materials generally rose. The tung oil market was particularly exciting, rising by 10% in one day.</p>
<h3>The Yarn and Cloth Management Committee Asks the Ministry of Economic Affairs to Record the Investigation of the Dutch East Indies Yarn and Cloth Market</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 1st Day] News from the Ministry of Economic Affairs: Since Japanese cotton textiles are competing for sales in Southeast Asia and smuggling is rampant in South China, the price of yarn and cloth is affected by the exchange rate, and the foreign sales of our textiles have been severely hit. In order to understand the yarn and cloth market situation in the Dutch East Indies, the Textile Foreign Sales Committee decided at its 19th meeting to invite one representative from the Textile Construction Company, two representatives from private factories, and one representative from the cotton textile industry to go to the Dutch East Indies, Bangkok, Singapore, Manila, and Saigon for on-site investigation. The travel expenses will be borne by the respective units. The Flower Yarn and Cloth Management Committee has reviewed and found it feasible and has telegraphed the Ministry of Economic Affairs for recording.</p>

<h3>All Classes at Yingshi University Have Resumed - Professor Xu Deyuan Reports in Hangzhou - The Truth About the Dispute Between the Jin and Liang Schools</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Jinhua, 1st Day] All students at Yingshi University resumed classes today.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Hangzhou, 1st Day] Because of an unfortunate incident between students from National Yingshi University and the Provincial Jinhua Middle School, Professor Xu Desha, Zhuo Ru, Director Nie Shiqi, and others were specially sent to Hangzhou yesterday to host the press and report the truth.</p>
<p>The borrowing of props for a play was the cause of the dispute</p>
<p>The general idea is that the students of Jinhua Middle School held a recreational meeting and came to borrow props, etc. More than a dozen students from the university went to visit, but were rejected at the door. The students of Yingshi University asked the students of Jinhua Middle School to ask the principal to come to the venue to solve the problem. But when Principal Hu arrived, he was aggressive and rude, saying that it was an obstacle to freedom. Later, with the persuasion of the guests, some students entered the venue, but booing broke out. The students of Yingshi University, feeling psychologically oppressed, left their seats and wanted to see Principal Hu. At this time, the dispute could have been resolved if Principal Hu had expressed a slight apology.</p>
<p>Principal Hu of Jinhua Middle School Refused to See the Mediator</p>
<p>More and more students from Yingshi University arrived. Cai, the Dean of Academic Affairs, and Zhang, the Director of Student Affairs, of the university rushed to mediate and represented Yingshi University to request a meeting with Principal Hu, but were still not granted an audience. The students of Jinhua Middle School tightly closed the outer door, and threw bricks, stones, and wooden sticks. Mr. Cai and Mr. Zhang were also insulted. The students suffered 17 serious injuries and more than 50 minor injuries. Later, County Chief Yang and others arrived at the scene and worked with Dean Cai to release the detained students. The next morning, police officers and soldiers from the military management area also arrived at the scene to maintain order. Regiment Commander Chen of the 102nd Regiment was willing to make a final mediation, but Principal Hu still refused to meet and did not get the point.</p>
<p>Soldiers Ignorantly Fired Guns - A Yingshi University Student Fell to the Ground</p>
<p>The soldiers fired blank guns, followed by live ammunition. One student from Yingshi University fell to the ground on the spot. Subsequently, there was a false rumor that a student had died, and the students went to Jinhua Middle School again to demand responsibility. Because the principal refused to meet, the order was disrupted, and the actions escalated, which is deeply regrettable, he said.</p>

<h3>British to Grant Special Treatment to Athletes from Various Countries Attending the World Games</h3>
<p>[London Dispatch from the British Information Office] The British authorities will exempt athletes from various countries attending the Olympic World Games in July from customs duties on various necessities they bring with them. This measure will allow them to save on expenses, as they will not have to pay domestic production tax and purchase tax on sports equipment, clothing, food, and other goods. This preferential treatment will surely be welcomed by athletes from around the world, but it is limited to World Games athletes and other personnel actually attending the World Games. To ensure that this does not lead to abuse, a special uniform certificate will be issued. Its use is similar to a passport, and certificate holders can ride British trains at half price. A special booklet containing detailed instructions has been sent to more than fifty World Games committees. This is the result of lengthy discussions between various sports committees and government departments. Many countries have notified the committee of the special foods and wines required by their athletes. The committee will exercise special caution in the preparation and distribution of these items to ensure that they are not affected by the black market.</p>

<h3>From the Army</h3>
<p>— Guy de Maupassant, translated by Li Qing'ai</p>
<p>This cemetery, filled with officers, was like a garden of blooming flowers. Military caps, rose-purple military trousers, gold epaulets, gold buttons, sabers, staff officers' tassels, light infantry and light cavalry's colored cloaks, all moved back and forth in the cemetery. The crosses on the graves, either white or black, spread their terrifying iron, stone, or wooden arms above the remains of the deceased.</p>
<p>They had just buried the wife of Colonel Limushen. She drowned two days ago while swimming.</p>
<p>The matter was over, and the priest left, but the colonel, supported by officers, stood in front of the grave, where he could still see the coffin containing the body of his young wife, which had already begun to decompose.</p>
<p>He was almost an old man, a tall, thin man with a completely white beard. Three years ago, he married the orphan of his fellow Colonel Soldi.</p>
<p>The two captains and lieutenants who were supporting him tried to lead him away. However, he resisted, holding back the tears that filled his eyes with a heroic posture, and later muttered in a low voice: "No, no, wait a little longer." He supported his weak legs and resolutely stayed there, on the edge of the grave, which seemed to him like a bottomless abyss into which his heart, his life, and everything he had left in the world would fall.</p>
<p>Suddenly, General Wolk came over. He grabbed the colonel's arm and almost dragged him away, saying: "What, what, old friend, you shouldn't be squatting here." So he obeyed and finally went home.</p>
<p>Just as he pushed open the door of his study, he saw a letter on his desk. He picked up the letter and almost fell because of surprise and emotion, because he recognized his wife's handwriting. The postmark on the letter was from that day. So he opened the envelope and began to read:</p>
<p>"Father, please allow me to call you father as before. When you receive this letter, I will surely be dead and buried. In this way, you may be able to forgive me.</p>
<p>"I do not want to think of any way to move you and mitigate my guilt. I will only use the sincere attitude of a woman who will commit suicide within an hour to speak clearly, completely, and without omission.</p>
<p>"When you married me out of kindness, I devoted myself to you out of gratitude, and I loved you with my girlish sincerity. My love for you at that time was almost like my love for my father in the past; later, one day, because I was sitting on your lap, and also because you kissed me, I couldn't help but call you 'Father'. It was a sudden, instinctive response from my conscience. Indeed, you were a father in my mind at that time, only a father. You smiled and said to me: 'Always call me that, my child, it makes me happy.'</p>
<p>"After we arrived in this city... Now please forgive me, father, I fell in love. Oh! I resisted for a long time, almost two years. Please listen carefully, almost two years, later I succumbed and became a sinner. I became a failed woman.</p>
<p>"As for 'him'. You will surely not guess who it is. I am very confident about this, because there were twelve officers in total, always around me, coming and going with me. You have long called them my twelve satellites.</p>
<p>"Father, please do not try to identify him, and please do not hate him. He did what anyone in his position would have done to me, and I really know that he also loved me sincerely.</p>
<p>"However, let me tell you: One day, our rendezvous was on Partridge Island; do you know it? That small island near the water mill. I was supposed to swim there and land, and he was supposed to wait for me in the woods, and then squat down until evening to avoid being seen coming out. As soon as I found him, I suddenly saw Philip, your orderly, from between the separated branches. He launched a surprise attack on us. I felt that we had all failed, and I cried out; then he, my friend, said to me: 'Swim away, slowly, my dear, let me and this guy stay here.'</p>
<p>"I left, so nervous that I almost drowned, and later returned to your house, waiting for terrible things.</p>
<p>"An hour later, Philip met me in the hallway of the living room. He said to me in a low voice: 'I am here to await Madan's instructions. If Madan has any letters to give me.' So I understood that he had betrayed himself, and it was my friend who bought him.</p>
<p>"In fact, I gave him many letters, all my letters. He sent them all, and also brought me replies.</p>
<p>"This went on for about two months. We all trusted him at that time, just as you trusted him at that time.</p>
<p>"Speaking of this, father, this is what happened to me. One day, I met your orderly again on that island where I used to swim, but this time, alone. This guy was waiting for me, and then notified me in advance that he would immediately report us to you and hand over many letters that he had stolen and kept, unless I expressed surrender to his desires.</p>
<p>"Blow, father, my father, I was afraid at that time, a despicable, cowardly fear, especially afraid of you, so kind and deceived by me, and also afraid for him, that you might kill him, and also afraid for myself, perhaps, now do I know? At that time, I was already confused and panicked, I believed in buying this evil again who loved me, what a shame!</p>
<p>"Our hopes are so weak, we women, so that we make more mistakes than you. Besides, when a person has already fallen, they are always falling to lower and lower places. Now do I know what I did before? Only understanding that one of you two and myself were about to die - I finally surrendered to this thug.</p>
<p>"You see now, father, you see now that I refuse to ask for an excuse for myself.</p>
<p>"Then, then, then, what I expected finally arrived - he took hold of me again and again whenever he wanted to use this to threaten me. He became my lover again, like another, every day. Isn't this embarrassing? And what a punishment, father!</p>
<p>"Then, I said to myself: 'I should die'. Living, I cannot confess such a great sin to you. Dead, I dare do anything. I can't do anything except die. There is nothing in the world that can wash me away. My stains are too severe. I cannot love, nor can I be loved; it is as if I contaminate anyone, just when I shake hands with them.</p>
<p>"In a while, I will go swimming and never come back.</p>
<p>"This letter to you must first be sent to my lover. He will surely receive it after I die, and without understanding anything, he will send it to you, thus completing my last freedom. Finally, you will read it after returning home from the cemetery.</p>
<p>"Farewell, father, I have nothing to say to you. Please do as you wish, and please forgive me."</p>
<p>The colonel wiped his forehead, which was covered with beads of sweat. His calmness, the calmness he had in battle, returned to him again.</p>
<p>He rang the bell.</p>
<p>A servant walked in.</p>
<p>"Call Philip to me," he said.</p>
<p>Then, he slightly opened a drawer in his desk.</p>
<p>The man came in almost immediately, a tall soldier with a big red beard, a cunning look, and glittering eyes.</p>
<p>The colonel stared straight at him.</p>
<p>"You tell me who my wife's lover is."</p>
<p>"Colonel, in the end..."</p>
<p>The officer held his pistol in the slightly open drawer.</p>
<p>"Speak, and hurry, you know I'm not joking."</p>
<p>"Then... Colonel... it's Captain Saint Albert."</p>
<p>Just as he said this name, a flash of fire burned his eyes, and he fell down, a bullet embedded in the center of his forehead.</p>
<p>Before she was eighty years old, if she didn't work for a day, she felt like she was confined. She said: "I'd rather be sick than idle."</p>
<p>National soldiers, Japanese rabbits, guerrillas, puppet troops, and real bandits, although she never left her house, she encountered them all. She often got up in the middle of the night and drove away bandits with desperate shouts.</p>
<p>Death should bow to her because she feared nothing. She prayed for death, she firmly believed that the underworld was definitely more peaceful than the world.</p>
<p>"Now I'm useless, eating idle rice." This was her mantra.</p>
<p>The ninety-three-year-old woman, eating a bowl of idle rice because she had lost her ability to work, expressed heartfelt shame to herself, to others, and to all things in the universe.</p>
<p>After paying her taxes, my mother devoted herself to worshipping Buddha. To avoid idle talk between mother-in-law and daughter-in-law, she gave up her twenty-year habit of smoking opium.</p>
<p>In the summer, I tried to persuade her to get a vaccination, but she always refused with the words "Old woman learning fashion, it's a laughingstock." Her eyes were so blurred that she often ate dead flies in the soy sauce bowl along with her brown rice. When others worried about her, she said it didn't matter, the Bodhisattva would bless kind people.</p>
<p>When she heard that my monthly salary was one hundred and twenty yuan, she was happy to the point of suspicion. She thought it was unreasonable to take so much money while never seeing the sun during the day or the sky at night. She worried that something ominous would happen to me.</p>
<p>Her only shortcoming was that she could never distinguish between the Kuomintang, the Communists, traitors, bandits, the Security Corps, and the Self-Defense Forces. She often tormented me with these old questions, with an apologetic expression. She didn't want to ask these things, because these questions had forced her to stop chanting scriptures.</p>
<p>The lives of several uneducated relatives in my family have taught me more than any university professor. My personality and thoughts have been greatly influenced by them. Because of them, I understand thrift, understand compassion, and understand real life. They have caused me to have an undying hatred for some other people, so that I often have a kind of determination that is not understood by outsiders. Although I have not followed my determination, it has more or less stopped the corruption of my body and mind. I still believe that I can be saved at any time.</p>
<p>I originally wanted to write more about this topic, such as how my sister-in-law would pick up a strip of torn cloth as wide as a finger on the grass on her way home from washing clothes, and always take it back to make a button, in case of need. But when I think of how my family all lived in the upper-middle class of the country, I'm embarrassed to ramble on.</p>

<h3>Family Anecdotes</h3>
<p>— Zhang Mingchun</p>
<p>Twenty-five years ago, the Chinese composition topic for the elementary school entrance exam was "Family Anecdotes." I now want to redo it voluntarily.</p>
<p>My father was a self-sufficient farmer who held the plow. When the rice was fragrant, he was a devout worshiper at the village's Land God shrine and a well-known good person who rushed to pay taxes ahead of others. The former village elders and local officials expressed satisfaction with him, saying he "knew his place." Those who lent money at high interest rates called him a model because he possessed the virtue of paying back early and paying all the interest.</p>
<p>He was once elected as the village chief. However, because there was a surplus of sixteen yuan in public funds that he couldn't handle, he was so anxious that he couldn't sleep or eat, which made my sisters afraid to laugh and talk loudly.</p>
<p>He was an admirer of officialdom. Because the county government was urging the verification of land deeds, he was alarmed by the words "severe punishment without leniency for overdue documents" on the announcement. As a result, he became overly anxious, checking and rechecking the deeds. He even verified the same deed twice and was so upset that my mother, feeling sorry for him, didn't dare to lose her temper.</p>
<p>Local bullies played minor pranks on him. He told me about them as stories, never mentioning revenge. He adapted to his environment, balanced his life, and maintained his existence through extraordinary diligence and forbearance.</p>
<p>The pair of shoes he wore when he got married remained half-new until his peaceful death at the age of fifty-nine.</p>
<p>In terms of timidity, he was fortunate because he passed away before August 13th [likely referring to the start of the Battle of Shanghai in 1937].</p>
<p>I have a maternal grandmother who is truly ninety-three years old this year and has never left the countryside. Apart from her only daughter—my mother—she has no other relatives, so she often lives with us. My maternal grandfather died when my mother was four years old. When I see my grandmother, I feel like I'm seeing a living symbol of chastity.</p>
<p>Strangely enough, she often opposed my studying. The only reason was that she was afraid I would grow up to write indictments and file lawsuits. She looked down on scholars and saw through the officialdom.</p>
<p>She almost never used paper money.</p>
<p>"A load of manure being sold for five thousand yuan is outrageous! Outrageous!" Since the war of resistance, she often made such remarks, always shaking her head, which already shook automatically.</p>
<h3>Yellow Bird</h3>
<p>— Lü Feng</p>
<p>You, over nine hundred fighting warriors, have come to this human battlefield with the warm breeze of the wheat ears.</p>
<p>Lucky little birds! Living in houses and traveling, wearing silver hooks and jade cups, inlaid with ivory and jadeite, with the inspiring and impassioned "Memorial to Departing Soldiers" engraved on them—that is to say, you also understand "dedicating yourselves to the utmost"!</p>
<p>The cage doors are opened, and the battle begins! You bite his leg, he pecks your neck. Attacking and killing each other, no longer caring about your beautiful feathers, leaping and tumbling endlessly.</p>
<p>Just as the charge rings out on the battlefield, and the sounds of fighting rise, until the opponent loses feathers and flees, the delicate yellow feathers scatter on the blood. Then people cheer, applaud, and praise!</p>
<p>You seem to understand that in this human marketplace, survival is battle, for yourselves and for the masters who raise you.</p>
<p>But I can't help but think of the fields and forests, when the morning sun first rises on the lake shore—the beautiful legend—your friend dies fighting a love rival.</p>
<h3>Recent World Literary Scene</h3>
<p>— Zhao Shen</p>
<p>Wartime Literature in Germany</p>
<p>During the war, the German propaganda department has always heavily suppressed bookstores and libraries. Therefore, non-Nazi literature is rare not only in libraries of other countries but also in German libraries themselves. Whether burning books or banning books, books still continue to be published. Since books opposing the Nazis are not allowed to be published, Germany can only publish reprints of famous writers' works, what is called classical masterpieces. Most of these writers are from the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. The popularity of these books is not only for escapism but also to take this opportunity to carefully appreciate the greatness of Germany's past literature.</p>
<p>The complete works of Romantic writers published by Insel-Verlag and Leipzig bookstores include female writer Annette von Droste-Hulshoff (1797-1848) printed in one volume on India paper in 1939, and Joseph von Eichendorff (1788-1857) printed in two volumes in 1940, while Novalis's works were published in 1942. Novalis's complete works were originally compiled by R.H. Samuel, who is now a professor at the University of Melbourne. Adalbert Stifter's complete works are in seven volumes, including two volumes of essays, and the novels "Witiko," "Nachsommer," and "Studien" were published in 1939 and 1943. The Propyläen Verlag published a historical-critical edition of Friedrich Hölderlin's (1770-1843) complete works in four volumes, with a preface by Friedrich Seebass. S. Fischer published a seventeen-volume complete edition of Gerhart Hauptmann's works in 1942. Anthologies include works by female writer Clemens Brentano (1778-1842) and Jean Paul (1763-1825). The eight-volume complete works of humorous writer Wilhelm Busch were published in 1944; because they contained several letters to Jewish friends, they were banned. The same thing happened to Roedl's "Adalbert Stifter biography" because he was a descendant of Jews.</p>
<p>Many important letters have also been discovered. Brentano's "Correspondence with Sophie Mereau" (Briefwechsel mit Sophie Mereau) was published in 1939; Ecuard Morike's collection was also published in 1939, with a preface by Seebass.</p>
<p>The biggest successes are two series of books: the "Spiegel" series, which includes over seventy novels; the "Trosteinsamkeit" series, which includes over two hundred short stories; and the "Eternal Treasures of German Lyric Poetry" series, which includes thirty collections of poetry.</p>
<p>Sometimes the purpose of publishing books is simply to attack the Nazis, covered only by a thin veil. They often use photocopying methods, and the Nazis have no way to catch their mistakes. For example, the reprint of Stifter's "Lesebuch zur Forderung Humaner Bildung" (Reader for the Promotion of Humane Education), just the title itself, is contrary to Nazi ideology. S. Fischer Verlag reprinted Matthias Claudius's complete works in three volumes in 1941, still using the etchings and woodcut illustrations from 1775, which contained many attacks on militarism.</p>
<p>Translations of foreign literature cannot fully express the actual demands of the German people. There are quite a few translations of John Steinbeck's works. Others include Racine, Gorki, Pushkin, Swift, etc.</p>
<p>The following biographical and critical studies are worth mentioning: Wilhelm Grenzmann's "G. Chr. Lichtenberg," Otto Dencke's "Lichtenberg biography" In 1943, on the centenary of Hölderlin, a collection of commemorative essays was published. Two good books have also been published about Goethe.</p>
<p>The following are some works by modern German novelists, some of whom are well-known. All of these are worth the attention of those who study modern German literature:</p>
<p>Werner Bergengruen's "Was sich der Feldherr denkt, wenn er nicht siegt" (What the General Thinks When He Does Not Conquer), a historical novel about pain and hysteria. Verika Mitterer's "Der ferne Fürst" (The Distant Prince), a medieval story. Arnold Ulitz's "Die Magd von London" (The Maid of London) is a Defoe-style novel. Konrad Haemmerling and Erna Grauthoff both wrote novels on Shakespearean themes. Arthur Luther's "Der Teufel" (The Devil) is about the Russian poet Lermontov. Ernst Wiechert's "Das einfache Leben" (The Simple Life) is also a good book.</p>

<h3>Tear Down the "Stone God Temple"!</h3>
<p>— Tong Tuo</p>
<p>I have always thought that ignorant men and women are most common in rural areas. For example, when the time is right, they want to have some entertainment, but they also borrow the name of the gods. Like welcoming gods and temple fairs, and outdoor operas, they are all held in the name of thanking the gods. Little do they know that people living in cities, despite the progress of science and the material enjoyment being countless times better than the simple life in the countryside, there are still more superstitious people who take flattering gods and worshiping Buddha as their only duty, and praying for good fortune as their only entertainment. It is truly felt that the old slogans shouted out twenty years ago, "Mr. Democracy" in politics and "Mr. Science" in society and culture, still need to be loudly appealed and reminded.</p>
<p>Sadly, the degree of ignorance of superstitious people in cities is even worse than in the countryside. A patient in the countryside seeks fairy prescriptions, invites Taoist priests to eliminate disasters and draw hexagrams, and prays for blessings. Under natural physiological conditioning, the patient's condition gradually turns for the better, leading to a sudden recovery. Thus, they attribute it to the care of the gods, and there is their consistent superstitious way. Urban patients are not like this. On the one hand, they are using modern injections, electrical treatments, blood tests, and stool tests—all conclusions obtained from physiology, anatomy, and pharmacology—to treat diseases along a purely scientific path. But on the other hand, they still do not abandon ignorant practices: buying lottery tickets and asking the gods, gambling on flower associations and asking the gods, prostitutes praying for the prosperity of their trade and asking the gods, wives wishing for a male birth and asking the gods... Moreover, because there is a great shortage of gods and Buddhas in cities, a pair of stone statues beside the racecourse is regarded as solemnly decorated gods and Buddhas, and day and night, people kneel down and kowtow to them on the roadside.</p>
<p>Recently, ignorant men and women have become even more devout to the two stone statues beside the racecourse. They put up a plaque and call it the Stone God Temple, apply real gold, hang red silk, decorate it with candle stands, and arrange incense burners, creating a magnificent view of a "roadside temple." If this is beneficial to society, there is only one point, which is to prevent the nearby street urchins from wandering around day and night. They have unknowingly acquired a new profession: similar to the temple monks in temples and monasteries. They light incense and candles for those who seek gods, and when the former leaves and the latter comes, they disregard the sincerity of those who seek gods and the incense offerings to the stone statues, and honestly and unceremoniously pull them out and sell them wholesale. Of course, there are also ignorant men and women who give a little money to reward them for their "service" in lighting incense and candles (they also provide cushions for kneeling).</p>
<p>The day before yesterday, the newspaper reported that Director Yu Shuping ordered the prohibition of ignorant men and women from burning incense in front of that "Stone God Temple," and sent two policemen to monitor, the reason being that it obstructed traffic. I was originally wondering: the Shanghai Municipal Government's enlightened administration has built a good reputation, but why has it not seen this and simply abolished the "Stone God Temple" in one fell swoop? Even if today's cities still have some stains, we can at least first scrub away one of the stains. Now, indeed, the police station is coming out to intervene, although their reason is only the weak "obstruction of traffic," but in fact, they can say that it is to eliminate superstition. If the authorities have the next determination, I believe that it is not enough to just send a few policemen to prohibit it and consider that their task has been completed, because this is passive; the fundamental method is to smash the plaque, remove the decorations, and then smear the stone statues with cement, which is the thorough way. If the authorities are willing to transfer their spirit of banning dancing to banning superstition, and use the means of banning opium to ban flattering gods and worshiping Buddha, wouldn't that be a happy thing! This newspaper's reprint of the casual words of idlers at the end of the report on this news on the 30th, the so-called "Let's see if Yu Shuping can be a successful director," such an Ah Q-style insult can be laughed off.</p>
<p>I respect religion as much as science, but I feel that religion and superstition are two completely different things. If we do not fight against superstition, the pure religion will never be able to express itself. Superstition needs to be overthrown and eliminated like opium. Today's increasingly serious "Stone God Temple" is only one aspect of it.</p>
<h3>Substance and Function</h3>
<p>— Sun He</p>
<p>I think that political reforms can be explained by borrowing two words from the Song Confucian scholars on moral philosophy: one is "substance" and the other is "function." The former is policy, doctrine, and principle. The latter belongs to technology, method, and style.</p>
<p>In the "substance" aspect, it must be established and can be practiced; "function" is just a minor issue.</p>
<p>The Three Principles of the People are incompatible with bureaucracy. If the Three Principles of the People are implemented, bureaucracy will fall without being attacked. As long as there is the determination and courage to implement them, even if the method is not brilliant, the technology is not high, and the style is immature, it is only a matter of time, and it will inevitably be quickly corrected, so as not to repeat the mistakes.</p>
<p>Driving skills are a small problem; the main thing is to see if the direction is accurate. If the direction is right, that is, if the steering wheel is held steady, even if the driving is not perfect, as long as you don't drive backward, you will slowly move towards a prosperous road and towards your destination. If the direction is inaccurate, even if the technology is high and you can drive fast, you will still inevitably repeat the mistakes. This is a plain truth.</p>
<p>I think it is unnecessary to quibble about the technical efficiency of administration; it is like nitpicking. Of course, we cannot avoid treatment for fear of illness, but picking small faults is not necessarily beneficial to the patient. We need to find the source of the disease, find the crux of the matter, rather than just looking at the superficial symptoms, and comparing the size of firewood is ultimately more important than examining the tip of a hair. Treating the symptoms is like retreating from a cold fever and stopping a headache; it is better to treat the root cause by killing bacteria and cleansing the internal organs. I offer this to the new cabinet.</p>
<h3>Seemingly Correct, But Actually Wrong</h3>
<p>— You Mojun</p>
<p>Zhuangzi's "achieving with the hand what the heart desires" (得手應心) has now become "achieving with the hand what the heart commands" (得心應手); and the same book's "each time down, the worse it gets" (每下愈况) has long since become "each time, the worse it gets" (每况愈下). The previous edition of this journal has already corrected this mistake. There are many such seemingly correct but actually wrong phrases, and they are not limited to the interchange of two characters. Now, let's talk about the three sentences "not just one instance" (不一而足), "how easy to talk about" (談何容易), and "flying yellow, rising fast" (飛黃騰踏);</p>
<p>"Not just one instance" (不一而足) comes from the Gongyang Commentary's twenty-ninth year of Duke Xiang, meaning not to be satisfied with the beauty of one thing. Now it is commonly used to mean that something is not just once, and it has become accustomed to being used, and people no longer feel that it is wrong. This is because of entanglement errors that have become seemingly correct but actually wrong.</p>
<p>"How easy to talk about" (談何容易) is found in the Book of Han, Biography of Dongfang Shuo. "The King of Wu said, 'Sir, you can talk.' The gentleman said, 'How easy to talk about!'" "How easy" is like saying "how can it be?" Also, the Biography of He Jin in the Later Han Dynasty says: "The affairs of the country, how easy can it be?" According to this, "easy" is not read connected to "how," so "how easy" is like saying "how can it be so easy?" This is because of segmentation into words that has become seemingly correct but actually wrong, and it has become accustomed to being used, and it has become a case of accumulated errors becoming the norm.</p>
<p>The "rise fast" (達) in "flying yellow, rising fast" (飛黃騰達) should be "step" (踏). Flying yellow is the name of a horse, as in Han Changli's poem: "Flying yellow stepping quickly, cannot look after the toad." Yellow represents the color of the horse, and flying describes the speed of the horse, so even though it is "stepping" (踏), it cannot look after the toad. Now, changing "step" to "rise" (達), it is thought that this is because of misunderstanding "yellow" as the "yellow list" (黃榜) issued by the emperor in the past. This is because of misunderstanding that it has become seemingly correct but actually wrong.</p>
<h3>Conversations on the Qin (Zither)</h3>
<p>— Banmeng Laoren (Old Man Half Dream)</p>
<p>In the past, when I was in Beiping, there was a classmate named Zhang, who was skilled in playing the qin (zither). Every night when the wind was clear and the moon was bright, he would bring his qin and come over to play a few tunes for me. Although I didn't know the qin and couldn't be like Bo Ya to Zhong Ziqi, and join the ranks of connoisseurs, listening to it also felt very enjoyable. My restlessness would disappear, and I felt that it was different from other instruments, and it truly had a captivating feeling.</p>
<p>Zhang had five qins in his room, the shortest and oldest of which was purchased after someone dug it up from the soil when he was an official in Baimen. The cracks were mottled, and it was over five hundred years old. When played, the sound was like a bell in an empty mountain or the sound of flowing springs, which was better than the other four qins. Zhang said that whenever a qin came into his hands, he could tell its quality at a glance, without having to play or tune it, in order to distinguish its age. I deeply believed it. Zhang asked me to write an inscription to carve on this qin, but I am uncultured and an amateur, so I barely managed to put together a saying for him at the time, which inevitably failed to live up to the beauty of the qin, like putting dung on a Buddha's head, and made me a laughingstock.</p>
<p>Zhang also said: The best qin wood is tong wood for the face and catalpa wood for the bottom; pure tong wood is second best; tong wood for the face and fir wood for the bottom is the next best. The qin takes tong wood as yang wood and catalpa wood as yin wood. When yin and yang are matched, the sound is harmonious. If pure tong wood is used, the yang side of the tong must be used for the face and the yin side for the bottom, in order to achieve yin and yang harmony. How to choose the wood is to select the tong wood that faces the sun, cut it off, and sink it in water. Its yang side faces up, and its yin side faces down. After soaking in water for a long time, take the upward-facing side to make the qin face and the downward-facing side to make the qin bottom. After the qin is made, the material of the qin face is turbid in the morning and clear in the evening, turbid when sunny and clear when rainy, while the material of the qin bottom is clear in the morning and turbid in the evening, clear when sunny and turbid when rainy. Good players can understand this intuitively, down to the slightest detail, which cannot be understood by crude and impetuous people. Zhang repeatedly wanted to teach me fingering, but I was unwilling to endure the hardship of plucking and picking, so I politely declined. This matter has been more than twenty years ago.</p>
<p>The poem says: "Planting paulownia and catalpa, collecting lacquer, thus felling for qin and se" (椅桐村漆，爰伐琴瑟). Using tong and catalpa wood for qin has been a long tradition. Later generations also used copper and stone, as well as ebony and other woods, to make qins. There are also those that are made of various short materials, glued and lacquered together, called patchwork qins. There are also those that are inlaid with tortoise shell patterns, brocade pieces, mixed with ivory, incense, and bone, covering the entire qin body, and called real qins. These mostly belong to decorations and are not the true purpose of the qin. The Palace Museum has a Song Dynasty kiln qin, called the porcelain qin, supported by rosewood, with the middle process of the image system, the length and shortness are appropriate, the fetal bone is fully exposed, its quality is purple sand, the thirteen emblem, filled with white twist, the foot are made of jade. There is an inscription in the dragon pool that says: "Maintaining the sand and tile, the system from Hongmeng, kites fly and fish leap, sing the south wind." In the Phoenix Marsh are the four characters "cultivate oneself rationally," the characters are made of Qin seal, the color is moonlight white, extremely crystal clear to the utmost. When tapped with a finger, the sound is like a tile jar. It is heard that Zheng Yingsun of Huizhou is good at playing the qin. When he strings it and plays it, he cannot make a sound. Does it also belong to the category of decorations?</p>
<p>There are inscriptions from eight families on the lacquered box of the porcelain qin, the first of which is by Emperor Qianlong. Ji Huang said: "Potters secretly made, coordinated with the sound of silk, not just like its shape, the divine truth exists. The elegant instrument of the Song Dynasty, which can be compared with the Xiaoliang? Thank them for cutting with axes, naturally without traces. Thinking of the beginning of the fight, the harmony is confused, like jade, warm in spring." Qian Chenqun said: "Official or settled is the correct color, the seven strings are already harmonious and flat, a drum is like spring for four seats, and a second drum makes us happy people, quietly seeing Shun on the banks of the He." Dong Bangda said: "Not cinnabar, not lacquer, not stone, not gold, the earth type is made of virtue, quiet and deep, Taohe on the shore of the South Dongqin, Yiyang has branches empty Yin Sen, after the fire tail is not焦, dense 理纹无侵, 慎 will Wanpu care the ancient heart, mountain mountain 欹崟, A stroke of a chord to announce the 元音". The rest are not fully recorded. Tao Yuanliang in the past had a stringless qin, saying: "But to get the fun of the qin, why bother with the sound of the strings." The greatest sound must be the rarest, the greatest taste must be the lightest, such as the porcelain qin, its meaning is probably here?</p>
<h3>The Unlucky Ninth Symphony</h3>
<p>— Guo Ping</p>
<p>The great German musician Beethoven (1770-1827) passed away after completing his ninth symphony. The modern German musician Bruckner (1824-1896) wrote his ninth symphony, but died without completing the final movement. Similarly, another German musician, Mahler (1860-1911), also died after completing his ninth symphony. All three of them were born in Vienna.</p>
<p>Regarding Mahler, there is the following true story. Mahler was extremely superstitious. After seeing the fate of Beethoven and Bruckner, he temporarily paused his work after completing his eighth symphony. He began to write songs, wanting to compete with fate, meaning that he did not want to have the name of "dying with the ninth symphony." Soon, he retired to a village in the Alps. Because he felt that the surrounding scenery was too beautiful, he couldn't help but devote his emotions to the ninth symphony. He began to compose, forgetting the lessons of the past.</p>
<p>One day, when Mahler was writing the last and greatest movement, an eagle suddenly flew in from the window, circling and flapping its wings in the room, causing plaster to fly everywhere and music sheets to scatter. Mahler quickly sat down in an armchair. After the eagle flew out, a crow flew out from under the armchair. Mahler considered it an ominous sign (Germans consider crows to be unlucky birds) and was dazed for a long time. He knew that death was coming, but he felt at peace in his heart. He poured his strong emotions and great melodies into his final chapter. He completed his ninth symphony, but before he could begin writing his tenth symphony, he died of illness in the village. Fortunately, his ninth symphony is famous all over the world, and many orchestras are playing his immortal piece. If anyone has seen the movie "Gone with the Wind" and understands music, then he must have heard some of the movements from this symphony.</p>
<h3>The Death of Liu Jin</h3>
<p>— Xing Jian</p>
<p>In the feudal era, where the emperor reigned supreme, the treatment of those who plotted rebellion was extremely cruel. In addition to exterminating the nine clans, the main culprits themselves were made to suffer as much as possible, dying slowly. Even more cruel was the practice of executing someone by slow slicing, then chopping off the skin, stuffing it with straw, grinding the bones to dust, and scattering the ashes, using it like a specimen to show the public.</p>
<p>Regarding the number of slices in slow slicing, opinions vary, and there is no consensus. Some say eighty-one slices, some say one hundred and eight slices, but according to what is recorded in books, the most tragic was as many as three thousand three hundred and fifty-seven slices, which took two days to die.</p>
<p>Zhang Wenlin's chronicle of Duke Duanyan of the Ming Dynasty records that when he was the principal of the Ministry of Justice, he personally witnessed the execution of Liu Jin:</p>
<p>"...Later, according to the imperial decree, Liu Jin was executed by slow slicing for three days, his body was chopped up and his head hung up to show the world. The number of slices for slow slicing was typically three thousand three hundred and fifty-seven, with a rest and a shout every ten slices. On the first day, it was customary to first slice three hundred and fifty-seven slices, like the nail of the big toe, starting from the left and right of the chest. When the knife first moved, there was blood flowing about an inch. Then, when the knife moved again, there was no blood. People said that the prisoner was frightened, and the blood all entered the lower abdomen and calves. When the abdomen was opened after the slicing, the blood all came out from here. In the evening, Liu Jin was escorted to the Wanping County Prison of Shuntian Prefecture. After being released from his bonds for a few moments, Jin was still able to eat two bowls of porridge. The next day, he was escorted to Dongjiaotou. The previous day, when Jin was executed, he spoke a lot about internal affairs, and his mouth was stuffed with hemp seeds. After dozens of slices, he died. At that time, the sun was rising. He and the supervising official, Shi Ben, jointly reported to the emperor, who gave the holy decree: Liu Jin has been executed by slow slicing, his body should be chopped, and the hanging of his head should be omitted. A large axe was used to chop the body across the chest, and the chest was blown away for several feet."</p>
<p>From this, it can be seen that the cruelty of slow slicing had reached its extreme. Compared with today's chemical castration, it can be said to be a comparison between a great sorcerer and a petty sorcerer.</p>

<p>Mr. Ban Shaoweng mentioned in a letter that he once traveled to West Lake with his brother Yu Jingzhai, intending to find "Yu Lou" as a place to reside. It is an interesting and wonderful story because Jingzhai shares the same surname as Qu Yuan Sou. However, they couldn't find its location, and some said it had already become a tavern, causing them to feel lost and disappointed. But things have no fixed owner, and heaven and earth are merely temporary lodgings. Before his passing, Mr. Qu Yuan had already expressed this sentiment in his poem Bid Farewell to Yu Lou. The poem reads: "Occupying a corner of the lake building, I lean on the railing here every year. The person in the building is gone, but the building remains, let Zhang, Wang, Li, and Zhao look at it as they please." This is one of the "Twelve Farewells." His farewell to Qu Yuan says: "This small garden is also quite nice, with potted ponds and fist-sized rocks arranged naturally. The spring breeze doesn't know that the Lord of the East has departed, and it still arrives on time every year." Bidding farewell to this world: "Since I have entrusted my form to this world, there is endless chaos and trouble. Once I transcend the three thousand realms, I will not care about the water, fire, and wind of the human world." And the most extraordinary of all is "Bidding Farewell to Yu Yue," saying: "I have spent eighty years of my life and energy on this one name and surname. Today, I take my true self away alone, letting it be worn away or passed down." The most likely to arouse empathy in scholars, one is "Bidding Farewell to My Writings:" "In my old age, I have made contributions to the literary world, writing poetry and prose in my spare time from studying the classics. I leave them all to the human world, and I will not hear of praise or criticism." One is "Bidding Farewell to the Four Treasures of the Study:" "My closest friends are the stationery, which helped me achieve fame in the world of writing. Alas, the heroes are gone, and the moss abandons the salary and sinks the spear." The so-called four treasures are paper, ink, brush, and inkstone. Paper and brushes are consumed the fastest, and ink is also easily used up, but only the inkstone can last a long time and be passed down through generations, so scholars often name their studio after an inkstone. As for the stationery of modern scholars, it is different from the old days. For example, our colleagues in the newspaper industry have the saying "Three treasures of newspaper reporters: ink, paste, and small scissors." Although it is somewhat humorous, it is also true. Even an old man like me, who only writes manuscripts and does not hold an editorial position, needs these three things at hand, let alone all the chief editors!</p>
<h3>Gray Hair</h3>
<p>— Shi Shufan</p>
<p>Gray hair changes and life is unpitying, the lonely lamp swells and recedes, each time seeming like the tide. The world's affairs become inkstones and bones become ..., How can the lung fire and heart soldiers not be extinguished?</p>
<p>Closing the door, I foolishly pray for the wild man's heart, outside the door, the red mulberry water is even deeper. Old stories, new ..., iron arguments, the border city collects tears to cast gold.</p>
<p>White ... sparsely ..., the grass grows long, swords and crowns from ten provinces grow of their own accord. Measuring clothes, people gradually say the waistline is large, can it make up for the war and famine?</p>
<p>The death of grass and the demise of trees are all related, a masterless decaying willow bends on the road. I lament that the life force before spring is exhausted, how can I expect a chance for rebirth to be asked by everyone!</p>
<p>The stars are distinctly clear, indicating direction, who is hiding in the cup, comparable to old Peng? The shadow of the sweaty whip before my eyes, drunk at dusk, weeping in the cowshed.</p>
<p>Waving my hand like the tail of a winnowing basket, I cannot form sentences, the rooster crows all night under the azure clouds. Reading history, I often sigh for the departure of Chen Liang, ... to ... to look with compassion at Ling Jun.</p>
<p>Dreams ..., carriage wheels, the moon turns in my lapel, I vainly pity the vast and expansive ... poetic heart. A stream without water, without sound or color, is not worth half an inch of the oil lamp's depth.</p>
<p>Heaven entrusts me to write of the suffering of this place, the slanting sun and returning crows, the ink waves surging. Even if I look from a high place in the desolate city, what can I say about the roaming guests of the southeast!</p>
