<h3>陸總徐州司令部參長　分析蘇魯戰局　指出樸匪軍之良策</h3>
<p>〔本報徐州十二日電〕陸軍總部徐州司令部郭參謀長汝瑰，十二日接見記者，分晰蘇魯邊區最近之戰局，認爲匪軍在蘇北各路之竄擾，目的在國大開會時造成京滬人心之不安，原有之匪軍主力爲陳毅部之第十一·十二兩縱隊，刻其第二縱隊已山魯境扺達增援，第七縱隊　能有小部參興，惟以其現有兵力，決不能有所作爲。膠東方面周村正在激戰，匪軍進攻之眞正目的，可能爲掩護其主力北波黄河，以逃避爲國軍所困。魯西黄泛區有匪軍一·四·六·三個縱隊之主力，惟前經國軍痛擊後，實力損失甚重，迄未補充竣。此外，陳毅部下之第三·八·　隊，已調至許昌，由陳賡指揮，現正會同　廣·孔從周匪部選犯洛陽。總計陳毅部共有十三個　隊，約十四萬人，擁有機槍等　兵器，其火力僅　與國軍第二級　相比擬、共　正作戰立尚不敵國軍十三個精銳之師　，惟其　處在於行　　忽善於設伏。國軍之遭受敗挫者，　全為在　阻地帶行軍，遭匪部襲擊，如在蘇北之卞倉，匪軍化七次在同一地點伏擊·至於匪軍之損失，以攻堅時爲最後，三十六年魯中南麻之役，可以證明，因匪軍　準備及戰術均落伍，匪軍所種　方「力的對比」已接近，全爲自欺欺人至少關內如此，關外有其他因素在內。論及戡亂軍略時稱：匪軍行動迅速，捕　其主力不易，正確之戰略，　將其追出根據地，迫至絕境面聚殲之。在不斷追擊中，可　其官喪志，兵逃亡，三十六年魯中滕縣等地會戰小，即獲此戰果。當匪軍第一·第四。　隊被迫至黄河三角地帶絕境內，聚殲匪近萬，投誠者甚多，有一部匪被追甚急，失去理智，竟乘津浦車南下　　蘇北被國軍生俘。至於肅淸綏區殘匪，必須建立地方武力，惟如何建立，尙有待中央政令之切實推行。</p>
<p>〔中央社徐州十三日電〕「逐出要地，逼至絕地，置之死地，乃當前撲　共匪之良策」　。此爲陸總徐州司令部郭參謀長汝　於接見京滬記者團時所發表·郭氏認爲此種剿匪辦法，將促共匪打不死要跑死，跑不死要餓死。郭氏並判　將來剿匪結局，並非將共匪全部毀滅，而係將共匪全部擊潰，祗要國軍追得緊，共匪就　得快。郭氏前以政府隨員代表資格參加前年國共　談時期之三人會議時，馬歇爾元帥嘗謂：中共有幾十萬爲主要犧牲之幹部，勢不可侮，三年來此項共匪幹部，在國軍節節追擊之下，多於流竄生活中消逝，代之而起者，又爲裏脅無知之華。馬歇元帥當年對由共爲主義　牲幹部之估計，今日祇能二三折計算，惟中共軍事人才缺乏，狡點者易獲發展機會，如當時依據三人簽署之軍事協定，中共應產生兩個集（團軍總司令·中共提出者。一爲彭德懷，一爲陳毅，余（郭氏自稱）當時曾問周恩來·彭德懷任集團軍總司令固合情理，另一集團軍總司令何以祇提陳毅，不提林彪·劉伯承？周答：陳毅勢力發展較厚，應當之無愧，由此可知中共祇知崇　勢力。郭氏繼就南麻戰役以後之陳毅兵力，作一槪括分析，陳毅現有兵力號稱十三個縱隊，約十五萬人，以魯西走廊爲其擾亂中原之根據蘇北·膠東·皖北·則視爲支戰塲，陳毅自慘敗於南麻戰役後，已暴露兩個弱點：第一，陳毅所揭　之反攻，祇是反而不攻，尤無攻堅之力；第二，陳毅所擅長之伏擊，不能對抗力雄厚之國軍，陳毅偶以小勝利，即誇稱已達到與國軍力的對比階段，實屬自欺欺人之談。郭氏末對擊破共匪之羣衆路綫，認爲應先從建立地方武力，撲減共匪之村幹部幹人手，惟地方武力不應山土豪劣紳把持，須由地方保家衛鄉豪傑之士掌握。</p>

<h3>捷克的教訓</h3>
<p>— 程天放</p>
<p>二月廿五日捷克的政變，和三月九日捷克外長揚馬沙里克（Jan　Masaryk）的自殺，應該給中國人和全世界人一個深刻的敎訓！</p>
<p>捷克是第一次世界大戰所產生的獨立國，她的而積只有四萬九千三百餘平方英里，人口一千四百七十二萬，（一九三四年統計，）實在只是一個小國。但是她在並世國家當中却很受人的　視，這不僅因爲她在歐洲地理佔了一個戰略上重要的地位，而且因爲她是東歐最開明最進少的一個國家。東歐各國中，只有捷克可以說得上名　其實地實行了民主政治，她的憲政施行的成績，不在荷闌比利時等之下。捷克敎育交通經濟事業都很發達，因此，捷克人民的智識和生活水準都較東歐任何國家爲高。捷京普拉格有很著名的大學。捷克的農業和工業平均發展，從事工業和農業的人數，均佔總人口百分之三十五。捷克的面積較安徽一省還小，然而戰前她有一萬五千五百公里的鐵路，（其中百分之八十爲國家所有，）六萬九千七百公里的公路，十二萬五千輛的汽車。捷克製造的糖，啤酒燻肉，皮鞋和玻璃器具，馳名於世界。煤鐵都相當　富，一九三七年產鐵一百六十七萬噸，鋼二百三十一萬噸，除自用外，大部份出口。木材，皮革，棉織品，毛織品，麻織品等，也大量銷行於國外。一九二七年捷克入口總値一〇九億八千一百萬克郎（合美金三億三千二百餘萬元），出口總値是一一九億八千二百萬克郎（合美金三億六千三百餘萬元）。政府財政也很平衡而健全，年年都是收支相抵，有點餘存，預算上從沒有赤字。一九三七年的收人是八十四億五千六百萬克郎，支出是八十四億五千四百萬克郎（均合美金二億五千六百萬餘元）。</p>
<p>捷克不但國富而且兵强，立國以來，政府對於國防事業，非常注車。一九一八年捷克共和國成立，第二年就聘請法國軍事顧問，訓練陸軍，並且採用了徵兵制度，二十歲的壯丁都要服兵役。這個軍事顧問團任職十年之久，將捷市眾事效能提得很高，使捷克陸軍在訓練及裝備上，均可爲歐洲最優秀的隊伍之一。捷克的軍火工業，在世界很著名，斯可達廠（Skoda）的出品，不在德國克虜伯廠之下。我國抗戰初期所用的機關檢步槍等就是斯可達廠所製造。</p>
<p>像捷克這樣的一個國家，眞可算得文治修明，武備充實，一切事實都在那裏蒸蒸日上。　者一九三六年及一九三八年，曾兩度訪問捷京，並曾參觀斯可達廠，游歷卡爾斯巴德溫泉。親自看見她的都市和鄕村的整齊淸潔，公共建築的堂皇偉大，人民的動勞聰慧，工藝技術的進步優良，一切都可與西歐相比，而無遜色。捷克社會裏充滿了振作進取的精神，而絕沒有腐化墮落的現象。然而就是這個國家，因爲介在蘇德兩大之間，又因爲有內奸，而引起外侮，在最近十年內，曾兩度遭遇悲慘的命運。第一度是一九三八到一九三九爲德國所吞併，第二度就是這次的政變。</p>
<p>捷克之能够建國，得力於湯麥斯馬沙里克（Thomas　G　Masarik）居多。（他就是跳樓自殺外長的父親）這位開國元勳，是二十世紀中全世界大政治家之一。因爲他學問的淵博，人格的偉大，以及畢生爲自由爲民主爲捷克民族解放的奮鬥精神，取得了美英法各國政府的同情，所以在一九一八年十月德國將次失敗之際，捷克共和國就正式誕生，而且就立刻得到列强的承認。湯麥斯馬沙里克被舉爲第一任總統，直至一九三五年底才因年老辭職（那時他己八十六歲），由貝納許（EduardBenesh即現任總統）繼任。</p>
<p>馬沙里克在職足足十七年，爲捷克奠定了民主和繁榮的基礎，同時在外交上更竭力謀國家的安全。當時捷克最怕的是德國復興，重爲捷克之患，所以和法國訂立同盟，和羅馬尼亞及南斯拉夫成立了小協商Little　Entente，到希特勒上台以後，在一九三五年更和蘇聯訂立了防禦同盟。在捷克人看來，有法蘇兩國强國做了盟邦，應該可以安如磐石了。那裏知道天下事往往出乎意料之外，捷克人民中三百三十萬的日耳曼民族，他們散佈在與德奧鄰境的蘇德登區Sudetenland。德國國力强盛以後，就利用這些蘇德登人在捷克內部製造糾紛，擾亂秩序，提出脫離捷克的要求。希特勒更藉口保護日耳曼人，而要佔領蘇德登。到一九三八年事能緊張。蘇聯袖手旁觀，法國則和英國對德採取妥協政策，慕尼克會議承認了希特勒的要求，將蘇德登區割讓興德國，另外還割讓了一大片土地與匈牙利，一小片土地與波蘭。捷克總共損失了十分之三的土地，和三分之一的人口，兩個盟友旣然置捷克於不　捷克只有忍痛接受這些條件，貝納許也因而辭職。到一九三九年三月希特勒可撕毀了慕尼克協定，進佔捷克全境，捷克遂整個滅亡了！</p>
<p>捷克在德國佔領下六年多，到一九四五年二月，德軍敗退，捷克乃慶再生，貝納許復任總統。捷克政府一向是抱睦鄰政策的，尤其是對斯拉夫民族的老大哥蘇聯，更是力求友好。戰前旣己締結了防禦同盟，這次解放靠蘇聯的軍力，自然格外不惜一切代價，以求蘇聯的歡心。蘇聯要求割讓努生尼亞區域（Ruthenia），捷政府立刻允許，又和蘇聯訂立互助條約和經濟條約，將捷克納入蘇　勢力範圍以內。一九四六年七月內閣改組，貝納許任共產黨的高德華（Klement　Gottwald）做總理，在廿六席閣員中，共然佔了九席，名爲五黨聯合內閣，而實際上共黨權力最大。貝納許以爲如此作風，總可見好於强鄰了。那知道侵略國家的野心，是不會有止境的，捷克儘管如此退讓，而在蘇聯總覺得將捷克和南斯拉夫羅馬尼亞等比較，她的獨立性和民主精神還是太濃厚了，還是不够做忠實的附庸國。尤其去年八月捷克政府在貝納許領導下居然穴稱要參加響應馬歇爾計劃的巴黎會議，更是激怒了克里姆林宮，所以莫斯科一個長途電話，就强迫捷克穴佈取消參加巴黎會議的決定。這種打自己嘴巴的事，是任何獨立國家所不能忍受的，而捷克居然忍受下去。但是克里姆林宮依然不加原宥，所以又發動這次政變，使得政府大權歸共產黨獨　，今後自然可以完全聽　斯科的指揮。所謂獨立，所謂民主，就成爲名存實亡了！現在貝納許行動是否自由，沒有人知道。揚馬沙里克痛心失望，就只有出於自殺之一途。他們父子兩人畢生盡瘁於國家民族，而遭遇到如此結局，眞使得全世界愛好自由愛好民主的人無限同情，無限悲憤。、</p>
<p>我們不僅爲捷克悲，我們更要反省一下中國的處境。捷克的共產然勾結外力來一個政變，中國的共產黨也正在勾結外力稱兵作亂。美國有一部份人（包括馬歇爾將軍在內），至今還認爲中國問題之所以嚴重，中國人民之所以如此痛苦，是由於勦共軍事，而勦共之軍事所以發生，則是由於州政治協商會議決議案之未能執行，包括共產黨在內之聯合政府未能成立。至於決議案何以未能執行，聯介政府何以不能成立，則政府與共產黨「雙方均有錯誤」（見馬歇爾本月十日對新聞記者的談話。）對於此點，我們不能不嘆息馬歇爾將軍和持相同見解的美國人，實在是太天眞了！世界上任何一國的共產黨，都是極　的政黨，有最强度的排他性，決不容許其他政黨的存在，更談不到與其他政然合作來担負政治的責任。東歐，西歐，以及中國的共產黨，所以在戰後强調聯合政府，完全是它　取政權的一種手段或一個步驟。在共產黨力量尙未充實，佈置尙未完成以前，它就利用「民主政治」的偽裝，要求與他黨聯合組織政府，等到它插足政府之後，認爲　機已到，即撕破「民主」的假面具，排斥他然，殺戮異已，走上獨裁的道路。自一九四六年夏天以來，東歐各國如南斯拉夫，匈于利，布加利亞，波闌等所發生的政潮，都充分證明這個道理。現在捷克事件，又增加了一個有力的證據。在接連五次相同的事變之下，居然還有人相信中國共產黨在政治協商會議中是眞心想和中國其他的政黨組織聯合政府，那不是痴人說夢，就是自欺欺人。爲中國計，爲世界計，幸而包括中國共產黨的聯合政府當時沒有實現，中國政府現在才有決心，才有力量，去抵抗國際共產黨的侵略。假如前年眞有了一個如此的聯合政府，恐怕和捷克同樣的政變早已先發生於中國，而中國也早已入於國際共產主義的勢力範園了！</p>
<p>國際共產主義在莫斯科領導之下，繼續不斷地向歐亞兩洲發展。這種發展，是有糾織有計劃的，號令統一，步驟整齊，等於一個大軍事行動的作戰計劃一樣。而在對方，愛好自由民主反對產主義的國家，則是思想紛歧，行動迂緩，力量散漫，甚至只要火未燒到眉毛，還要抱得過且過的心理，如同英美許多人，一面反共產，一而又認爲中國共產黨的搗亂是中國自己的問題，別的國家可以袖手不問。照這種情形下去，共產主義對全世界民主國家，眞可以各個擊破，達到它統治世界的野心了。古人說：「亡羊補牢，猶未爲晚」。捷克已矣，全世界民主國家的人民，如果不願自己國家做捷克第二，那就要趕快覺悟，趕快團　　鬥，扺抗共產主義的進攻，才能挽教世界的厄運；否則總有一天要後悔無及的。</p>

<h3>俞鴻鈞在立院報告　美各項貸款及用途</h3>
<p>〔本據南京十三日電〕財長兪鴻鈞十三日在立院例會中據吿勝利後美國援華之各項貸款及其用途，內容如次</p>
<p>勝利後之美國援華貸款，依其性質及來源之不同，可分爲四類：</p>
<p>甲·戰後借款物資，根據各機關之購料計劃，由戰前駐美物資供應委會與美方洽商。此類貸款均係信用貸款，依約由政府按期還本付息。子·美國進出口銀行貸款：（一）棉花貸款三三〇〇萬美元，至本月底止已動用三二九七萬六千美元；（二）鐵道借款一六六五萬美元，至今年一月止，已遝到一五二〇美元；（三）動力廠機借款八八〇萬美元，至本月底已動用三九〇萬美元；（四）購船貸款二六〇萬美元，購船十六艘，已動用二四五萬美元；（五）採煤器材貸款一五〇萬美元，已動支八二萬五千美元；（六）永利化學公司貸款一六〇〇萬美元，由政府擔付；（七）船隻貸款四二〇〇萬美元，因購船不易，尙未動用。以上七項貸款共八二七五萬美元，除六·七兩項外，政府可利用者六二五五萬美元。丑·美國政府貸款：（一）租借法案之借購物資借款五八五〇萬美元，至去年底已動用五〇一七萬美元；（二）航務局借款一六五〇萬美元，購買船隻，已動用六九四萬美元，總計戰後借款物資一億四九四二萬餘美元。</p>
<p>乙·戰後租借物資多係軍用，由國防部直接處理，我駐美顧大使轉來之美國務院帳單所列達七億四七二八萬餘美元，其中（一）軍火兵工一億一一七四萬二千餘美元，（二）飛機三五六二萬美元，（三）坦克九九九九萬美元，（四）船隻三二八〇萬美元，（五）軍用裝備五五八一萬餘美元，（六）生產設備三萬六千餘美元，（七）農工設備三七〇〇餘萬美元，（八）勞役三億五三八二萬餘美元，共計七億四七二八萬餘美元，惟據國防部報吿，接收時根據原始淸册之計算，此項戰後租借物資應爲八一〇一一萬三千餘美元。此外海軍接收者爲二四三八萬餘美元，共計一億零五百四十餘萬美元，相差達五億餘美元；其原因乃（一）美方交來之淸單過於簡單，無法雙方對核，（二）淸單中無決定性者達五億七千餘美元，（三）勞役費用難以核對，（四）其他專案物資是否亦混合列入，則不得而知。此類差額情形，我已電顧大使查詢。</p>
<p>丙。剩餘物資係抵償債務性質，由物資供應局經辦共有三項（一）華西區，卅四年十一月由宋前院長與美方簽訂，其內多係航空器材，由前航委會接收，美方首次估價爲美金六七三七三萬一千元，法幣五一億六千萬元，接收時爲五七三六萬九千餘美元及法幣九二億七千餘萬元，其中法幣一項，即以我方代美墊付之款項抵除（職時建築後方機塲等工費），（二）海軍承購原約中未定總額，規定由江南浩船廠前往太平洋各島承購，而由江南造船廠爲美方修理船隻作抵，（三）太平洋區卅五年八月由宋前院長與美方簽訂，其中有五億美元之移動物資八四〇〇萬美元之在華固定設備，美方並三千萬美元作爲運費，除簽約前應付之七四〇〇萬美元物資不計外，其餘由美軍駐華時我墊付之法幣一三〇〇億抵償，尙欠五五〇〇萬美于元，以三五〇〇萬美元充美方在華購房屋之用，另以二〇〇〇萬美元充作美方在華敎育基金。上項物資均由物資供應局接收，至二月底止，己接收二七八〇〇餘萬美元，運抵我國者達一七五〇〇萬美元，限六月底前全部運抵。我國此類物資，以百分之七十撥交交通·國防兩部，百分之卅標售，繳解國庫。</p>
<p>丁·善後救濟物資，行總收到救濟物資五三五〇〇餘萬美元，海洋運費一二二二五萬美元，共六四七五〇萬美元，其中美方資助者佔百分之七十二，計四六〇〇〇餘萬美元係由行總處理。</p>

<h3>西歐外交重心移巴黎　十六國會議明揭幕　美與受援國討論輸送物資</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社巴黎十三日電〕五國會議閉會後，外交活動之重心已自魯寒爾移至巴黎，十六國會議將於明“在此間舉行，届時至少有十四國之外長將出席該會議。觀察家稱，該會之主要任務，係討論歐洲各國復興問題，但此亦爲國政治家互相商討議事日程以外各項問題之最佳機會。首先將　取關于歐洲經濟復興之意見，此項報吿可　爲互助及合作各種成績之「總　綫」，然後將審閱美國及歐洲資源及生產團體之報告。據悉，美國方面之報告大體與技術委員會去秋所作者相同，同時將設立一「常務委。會」，包括十六國代表或尚包括西德代表一人在內。此項委員會係去秋歐洲合作委員會之後身，其任務乃爲成立一永久機構，俾便執行馬歇爾計劃。各方面關于此一永久機構之職權問題，意見頗形分歧。芳于方而稱，此一機構如僅賦有諮詢之權，則必不能順利達成任務。尚有其他國家則稱，此機構不必具有分配貨物之權，蓋如此將侵犯有關國家之主權，但如欲獲致滿意之結果，善意與合作實屬「必不可缺」。總之，此一決定對于歐洲將有極重大之影　，此爲不可否認之事實。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社巴黎十二日電〕義大利外長史福　與希臘外長兼副總理蔡爾達　斯，各率本國代表團，均將於明日到達巴黎，準備出席經濟合作之大會。</p>
<p>〔中央社華盛頓十二日電〕據國務院發人本日稱，際茲國會尚未通過歐洲復興計劃時，參加該計劃之十六國代表與美國負責官員，本日在此舉行非正式會談，爲之姓歐洲復興計劃奠定基　。據稱，是項會談係探人測性者，旨在決定輸入物資之種類，籍以供給歐洲復興計劃執行者以必要報吿。</p>
<h3>英土外長晤談　重申兩國友誼　挪否認蘇要求商談締約</h3>
<p>〔路透社倫敦十二日電〕土耳其外長沙達克赴巴黎出席十六國會議前，今日在倫敦與貝文外相舉行會談，討論與英土相互有關之問題，及可能因歐洲復興方案而引起之問題。會談以後發表之公報有云，此次談話得有機會以保進兩國及政府問之密切友誼。英土兩國今後當繼續已往之合作，以一九三九年之英土同盟條約爲基礎，保持良好關係及世界和平。公報並正式重申一九三年英法土互　條約之繼續有效該約係於對應戰爭爆發後簽訂，規定土耳其如受歐洲國家之侵略而參加地中海區之戰爭，英法必須給予土耳其以援助。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社奧斯陸十二日電〕挪威外長蘭琪今日否認外傳蘇聯要求與挪威政府商談簽訂互助公約。</p>
<p>〔路透社倫敦十二日電〕此間咸傳蘇聯政府已向挪威要求締結互助條約，若蘇聯業已向芬闌所建議者。權威方面相信此等傳說僅係謠傳。此間官方人士之意見，乃爲法義共黨之參加共產情報局，堪爲共黨動向之指示。最近莫斯科及貝爾格勒之行動，證實四月十八日開始之義大利普選，乃共黨戰略小之下一決定性事件。倫敦方面雖無一人否認蘇政府在相富時間內有向挪威建議締結防守同盟之可能，然迄至目前爲止，蘇聯在歐洲之政策，似尙僅限於鞏固去年巴黎十六國馬歇爾方案會議所確立界綫以東的蘇聯勢力範圍。英人之意乃爲蘇政府如果企岡將挪威等業已明示其獨立姿態之歐洲國家，拖入蘇聯勢力圈內，將爲一極度嚴重的發展。與蘇聯對　將有要求之謠言同時發生者，乃爲挪國防部長霍傑之訪問倫敦具有特別作用之傳說。霍傑係於上週末自柏林取道倫敦返挪，雖日霍傑之來倫敦係爲與英陸軍部討論德境英軍區挪威佔領軍之未來地位，及訂購英國噴射式戰鬥機，然敏感之人，相信霍傑之來英尙方其他任務。</p>
<h3>蘇威脅希土　美應採行動　貝爾納斯提出警告</h3>
<p>〔路透社南卡羅林那州却爾斯登十三日電〕前國務　貝爾納斯今日在其原籍却爾斯登城發表談話，認爲美國應鄭重警吿蘇聯，吿以義大利，法國，希臘，土耳其之獨立如受恐嚇方法之威脅，美國即當開始行動，決不僅以提出一紙抗議書爲限。貝氏指出杜魯門總統於一年前發動杜魯門主義時，即曾向前述諸國保設，當彼等之獨立如受侵略者直接或間接之威脅，美國即當行動。</p>
<h3>蘇報評論　西歐聯盟</h3>
<p>〔聯合社莫斯科十二日電〕消息報今日載「觀察家」一文，題爲「白魯塞爾的反歐洲和平陰謀」，據稱，「白魯塞爾五國會議將獲致美國對西歐人民國際政治生活之肆無忌憚的干涉。蘇聯曾於本月六日照會美英法，指各該國化西德國爲軍事基地，以備　蘇實施　略，白魯舉爾會議乃此種政策之又進一步。</p>
<h3>荷共黨擬組　行動委員會</h3>
<p>〔路透社阿姆斯特丹十二日電〕荷蘭全境今日發旦傳　二十餘萬份，促荷關共黨組織「行動委員會」，以促進「國民福利」，並令此等委員會派員參加四月四日在阿姆斯特丹舉仃之民衆大會，以「完成興東歐之合作，反抗美國之威脅。」</p>
<h3>四強討論奧和約　會議獲進展</h3>
<p>〔路透社倫敦十二日電〕四强奧國問題代表頃採納法國所提之建議，將逐章比較法國與蘇聯分別所提關於奧境德產定義之建議，此舉已使賡續一週餘之程序上的無局爲之打破。今日之會，曾比較兩國關於奧境德產油業之建議，週一將比較關於多瑙河航業公司之建議。</p>
<h3>陰沉天氣萬衆街頭致敬　捷故外長昨國葬　貝奈斯僅參加初步儀式</h3>
<p>〔聯合社捷京十三日電〕故外長馬蕯里克今日由共黨治喪委會主辦，在陰沉天氣中舉行隆重國葬。禮堂設在國立博物院，自淸晨起即有無數人　集博物院，國會大厦及中央廣塲各街道。花店鮮花銷售一空，砲車曳靈柩車徐徐行過時，咸向之投擲。昨日自晨至暮男女人民魚貫向馬薩里克遺體致最後敬禮者在廿十五萬以上。</p>
<p>〔合衆社普拉格十三日電〕捷克人民百萬人十三日　集普拉哈街頭向馬隴里克致最後敬禮，軍警雁立於葬儀所經二哩道路兩側，阻止羣衆之　湧向前。道旁居民已接警告，在葬儀隊進行時，不得啓窗。按內閣閣員外交使團及數十萬平民均將參加此一行列。自共黨政變後，貝奈斯總統即離京城深居不出，然此次亦將離鄕間別墅主持葬儀。官方公報僅稱，總統參加普拉格博物院中之初步儀式，共黨總理高德華將代表總統領導行列自博物院往邱寗宮。邱寗宮即外交部所在地，亦將有簡短儀式。然後殯車再赴朗尼地方馬氏之祖墳，預計貝氏均不擬參預。高德華發表葬儀演說稱：本人最禾預料之事而竟發生矣，非常悲慘之事旣已發生，本人身爲總理，必須發表葬儀演說，必須伴同吾人愛友赴其長眠之地。馬氏與本人最近尙歡然共談吾人內政外交政策之光明前途，渠仍如常日一般樂觀，吾人除政事外且談及私事，而提及馬氏在議會演說後赴山居休養，噩耗傳來猶如晴空霹靂，對本人及其友好而言，此乃一可怕之打擊」。</p>
<h3>塔虎脫要求消減援歐經費　美參院予以否決　援歐案四月前完成立法手續</h3>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓十三日電〕共和黨參議員塔虎脫提議，將歐洲復興計劃第一年支出經費削减爲四十億元，已於昨晚以五十六對卅一票被否決。預料此五十三億元援歐法案即可迅速通過，於四月一日起開始動用，惟尙有許多其他修正案須待表決。</p>
<p>塔氏修正案之打消，似爲反對歐洲復興計劃中的一個高潮。參院開會至夜半始散，十三日將繼續會議，就此案作最後表決。</p>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓十三日電〕共和黨兩領袖參議員塔虎脫與范登堡，昨夜對於援歐法案時限以一年爲度或四年爲度問題，第一次公開發生齟齬。范氏稱，此項法案擬以四年爲度，惟任何届國會不能約束下一届國會，祇可視受助國是否能履行其義務，一年一度討論繼續援助事宜。塔氏反駁稱，「余完全不同意。並無此種義務。受助國與吾人並無契約關係。」</p>
<h3>英議員七十一人　要求組西歐聯邦</h3>
<p>〔合衆社倫敦十三日電〕除共產黨外，英國議會中各黨派　員七十一人聯名提出議案，建議立即採取行動，以組縱西歐各國間之聯邦，而拯救民主。此舉爲歐洲第一個議會嘗試實現一世紀來之美夢。英外交部對此提案拒絕評論，各黨議　要求確立緊急「革命性」之長期政策，以組織西歐經濟政治聯邦。按此動議適與白魯寒爾條約之締結同時發生，然其重要性較後者尤大，蓋不僅爲西歐統一之基礎也。</p>
<h3>西班牙要求　善美西關係</h3>
<p>〔合衆社馬德里十二日電〕據自權威方面獲悉，西班牙政府曾吿此間之美駐西代辦稱，由於捷克與芬蘭最近事件發生，美西兩國之間保持密切關係，對於西方文明極關重要。</p>
<h3>捷克事件列入臨時議程　安理會週三討論　智利向聯合國對蘇提出控訴</h3>
<p>〔聯合社成功湖十二日電〕智利今日要求聯合國機構　查蘇聯在捷克共黨政變中之地位。此案已列入十七日安理會臨時議程。捷克外長馬薩里克暴卒後，該國駐聯合國常任代表巴柏尼克曾函請調查，但被聯合國秘書長賴依加以擱置，今日始由智利代表奉該國總統費特拉之命，正式提出控訴。智利並指責蘇聯採用希特勒之技倆。自兩年前伊朗事件發生以來，蘇聯直接被控於安理會，此爲第一次。此種試驗案，第一步將討論是否列入正式議程，此乃程序問題，不受五大國否決權限制。西歐各大國對　蘇聯在歐洲及其他地方擴張勢力，又將實行攤牌。有人揣測蘇聯將步一九四六年三月之故智，於安理會討論此案時退出會塲。</p>
<h3>芬蘭代表團　定週六赴莫斯科</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕倫敦十四日廣播：海爾辛基訊，芬總統貝卡拉今日宣佈，芬蘭代表團將於本月二十日啓程赴莫斯科，談判蘇芬友好條約。</p>
<h3>英與外約但　修約談判順利</h3>
<p>〔路透社倫敦十三日電〕關係方面息，英國與外約但之新約，可望於下星期一在外約但首都阿曼簽字。在阿曼進行之修約談判，進展迅速，幾已順利完成。</p>
<h3>蘇拒與猶阿代表　商聖地分治問題</h3>
<p>安理會明聽取四强報吿</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社成功湖十二日電〕安理會定期下星期一開會，繼續討論巴勒斯坦問題。按安理會於本月五日曾委託會中五當任理事國會商巴勒斯坦局勢，而於十日內報吿全會。</p>
<p>〔聯合紐約十二日電〕蘇代表葛羅米柯今日在四大國會議拒絕與猶太代表討論巴勒斯坦問題。猶太代表促請執行聯合國大會所通過之分治案，葛氏默坐兩小時，不發一言。美·中·法三國代表決定邀請阿刺伯高級委員會派遣代表於十四日參加會議時，亦無表示。事援，葛氏向記者稱，渠仍以爲與阿刺伯及猶太代表談判，徒增糾紛。</p>
<h3>美以大批車輛　供希臘使用</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社雅典十二日電〕美國駐希軍事代表主任佛　將軍今日聲稱，曾以英製之新式車輛三萬五千輛交與希臘政府，供希臘國防軍之用。</p>
<h3>片山將就任　日閣外務省顧問</h3>
<p>〔路透社東京十三日電〕據接近社會民主黨之人士透露，前首相片山哲或將出任外務省顧問，現首相蘆田均曾一再請片山哲担任外相之職，片山均予蜿辭。片山承認渠之婉辭頗覺爲難，故渠已願意應蘆田均之請，担任外務省之顧問，但以不負政治責任爲條件，料片山哲之聘任書不久即可發表。</p>
<h3>食米會議議已結束　決設國際食米會</h3>
<p>東南亞即成立支部</p>

<h3>迅速計算器</h3>
<p>百萬位乘法僅需一秒鐘</p>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓十二日電〕美海軍以六十萬美元製一自動計算器，能以驚人速度解答繁複之方程。此器重二十五噸，已由哈佛大學分裝廿卡車，運至佛及尼亞州達爾格萊之海軍試驗塲。此器計算異常迅速，百萬位之乘法僅需一秒鐘，十萬萬以上之加法僅需五分之一秒鐘。</p>
<h3>法煤礦工潮擴大</h3>
<p>〔路透社巴黎十二日電〕加萊省及北省國有煤礦之罷工，已逐漸擴大，至今參加者有三萬人。</p>
<h3>日政府向盟總請求　貸日十萬萬美元　俾能即行實施五年計劃</h3>
<p>〔中央社東京十三日電〕中央社記者本日自權威方而獲悉，日政府已請求盟總與十一盟國談判十億美元之信用貸款，俾實施日本經濟復原之五年計劃。日政府並請求保證，有充分糧食輸入，以供日人食用。依據日政府計劃，如獲得該項信用貸款，而糧食之輸入亦獲保證，則日本之五年計劃完成後，其經濟水準將恢復一九三〇至三四年之程度，一九五二年時，日本將能以自費轍人糧食以供其人民食用。</p>
<p>〔合衆社東京十三日電〕盟國管制日本委員會將於十七日舉行第五十四次會議，其議程已於星期五發表，顯示四會員國均未提出正式討論程序事項。</p>
<h3>英國的憲法</h3>
<p>— （英國愛梅立著匹夫譯）</p>
<p>英國的政制可以說是一個對國會負責的政府，但必須記着，這責任不是僅對國會的大多數或是產生大多數的黨的機關而言的。閣員大臣在就職以後，第一件事就是對英王負責保衛全國及帝國的利益。在國會議員的立場而言，他們是向整個國會負責的，同時對全國人民負責，促成國會作爲全國生命的中心，負責保特每個政策的充分及自由討論，負責支持發言人主持正義的尊嚴。在這些責任以外，他們作爲黨內的領袖人物，對自己的黨更負有發揚黨的特性，及展開黨的利益的責任。</p>
<p>「責任」這名詞却有兩重意義：它不僅外表上對當軸負責，而旦須具有一種權衡輕重當機立斷的獨立意識。人家的贊同與否可以不管，英國的政府不僅是對授命就職的常軸，負起一個普通經理對股東老闆的責任，而是一個獨立的團體。在就職以後，憑自己的判斷及信念，負起領導全國及國會的責任的。在各方面看來，反對黨的責任，不比政府的及政府的支持者爲輕鬆。反對黨一方面負着國會裏的批評任務，同時須闡明它的主張，使公共的興論相信它能有執政的資格。政府方面負責的領導和國會方面負責的批評結合在一起，便是英國憲法的靈魂，每一個時代都有需要改變憲法的外在的機構，或與以局部的調整，這種演變是不可避免的，但一定要設法保有它的主要的　魂。</p>
<p>我們不能否認目前的情形，對我們憲法機構的需求繼續在增加，同時政府和國會都有應接不暇的趨勢。在身心交瘁的工作狀態中，英國憲法制度的血管，開始感到血壓過高的苦痛，如何能使它們經得起最近將來更緊張的局面呢？我們如何能擴大這些血管使它們能够輸送心臟听必須供給的血量，庶幾身體可以勝任新的工作？換言之，我們如何能使國會的討論可以勝任。我們知道這一點，對於自由政體是非常重要的，它不啻是防衛獨裁及專權的堡壘，如何去分配腦子及身心的工作，使不致工作過度，或浪費精力？換言之，如何在現在內閣制度的機構內，以適當的重要性及權力，授給設計及籌畫的一方。</p>
<p>關於後一點，我認爲現在時機已到，必須將內閣最高權力交與一個不超過六個閣員的小團體，每一閣員負責的不是一個互相有關部份的行政，而是它的政策。我必須提醒讀者的，便是類似的制度已在第一次大戰時的戰時內閣內試行成功，現在的政府至少在國防及經濟的政策上，亦似乎朝着這方向。</p>
<p>關於國會如何能勝任它的工作的問題，已有許多人提供意見，我在此僅能指出這些意見的市要性，而並無進一步討論其內容的意思。國會的若干工作，是否可以移到省政府，或類似在北愛爾　設立的立法機關內去，至少是値得我們詳加討論的。照我個人的意思，無論如何國會爲能應付繁重的工作起見，必須加以擴大，有一處我認爲可以充分利用的，便是上議院。我必須聲明，並無藉此以與下議院抗衡的意思，我只指望上議院所代表的更廣泛些，同時建立起終身議員的制度，以保有個人超然性的主要特點。此外希望名額擴大後，在不破壞良好傳統的情形下，作各稱必須的改革</p>
<p>我個人的意思尙不盡於此，經濟及工業上的問題，在今天已變成如此重要，我相信應付之下議院決議以前，必須給以充分及實際的討論，應當使它與純粹的黨的理論與程序完全脫離。數年以前，邱吉爾氏曾提議成立一個工議院，由勞資雙方的代表來組成之，在輔導的範圍內，賦以處理社會及工業問題的權力，由它歸納出結論，送國會作爲參考。</p>
<p>這樣一個團體，我相　將吸收工業界勞資雙方的優秀份子，尤其將與勞資雙方的活動一個新的範　及較大的責任。今天我們已看出國會有逐漸被排斥於政府與圈外團體直接談判之外的危機，這種談判是無可避免的，但照我的想法，對於這種危機的答覆，最好是把這些有關係的東西，帶回到國會機構的範圍及責任以內去。</p>
<p>使國會成爲全國政治生命的中心及焦點，使所有發生的問題，充分地自由地負責地在國會內討論，不使大權旁落到圈外不負責任一的團體手裏去，不論是　的機構，或是工業界的團體也好，這應當是我們每個愛護自由政體的人的最大的目標（匹夫譯一九四七年十二月五日寄自利物浦）按這篇文章原是英國L.S.　Amery在英國BBC的廣播演講，後刊在Listener雜誌上，在全歐動　不安的政治　面中，英國獨能偏安一方，並不是　然的，讀者讀了本文以後，或許可以得到一部份解答。茲介紹此文，亦因爲它能帮助我們明暸英國政治制度和它的各種微妙的關係。（完）</p>

<h3>要求釋放三同事　中行起怠工狀態　經當局勸導即恢復正常</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕四行二局員工，於本月八日曾因要求改善待遇，擬發動「延工」（延長工作時間）未果，當時有中國銀行職員張頌慈，劉善長，周耀瑾三人，被治安當局認爲係推動該事件之「四行二局員工聯誼會」主腦人物而加逮捕，迄昨五日，尙未釋放。昨晨張頌慈等家屬扶老擕幼，到外灘中國銀行，向各同事哭訴呼籲，各部門同事深表同情，紛紛請求中行當局出面向市府請求迅予釋回，並即於九時半起，該總行國外部信託部儲蓄部及滬行營業廳全體行員發生類似怠工之狀態，昨適爲週末，業務特繁，因此使櫃外顧客鵠候辦理各種手續而大爲焦急。中行總經理宋漢章乃親自向行員勸導解釋，並赴市府代爲陳情，請求將張頌慈等三人開釋。據聞市府沈秘書長已口頭允許，俟吳市長杭州回來，對該案儘先辦理。宋氏回行後，即在四樓餐廳召集行員訓話，並報吿交涉經過，全體行員認爲滿意，至下午一時許，一切已恢復正常，票據收解交換等業務，得未受影響。</p>

<h3>關於人民遷徒登記　仍由自治機關受理　民政局長發表談話</h3>
<p>據市府民政局局長張曉崧發表談話稱：關於人民遷徙登記，改由警察機關受理一節，民政局與警察局職權如何劃分，外界猶多未明。査本局前奉市政府轉下內政部函頒警察機關與戶政機關査報戶口要項八點，其中第四項規定，人民遷徙登記之聲請，歸由警察機關受理，此實未明渦去本局辦理戶籍登記與警察機關連繫情形，蓋本市不僅遷徙登記，其他各種戶籍登記，均在聲請書上附有通知聯，由各區保於受理聲請後，通知警察機關登記以備稽査。</p>
<p>本市自治機關刻正辦理直接有關戡亂之征兵業務，及安定民生之全面配給，在在均賴戶籍登記之正確性，而都市人口之遷徙頻繁，幾佔全部戶籍登記中之主要部份，若將遷徙登記歸由警察機關受理，自治機關未能隨時把握全面人口之正確，則辦理民生配給及征兵業務，勢必失敗。如黄浦區某機關，最近忽將壯丁二百多名聲請遷出，企圖逃避兵役，市參議會有鑒於此，乃通過議決案，電請內政部收回成命，關於市民遷徙登記，仍由自治機關辦理。本人爲業務上之需要，亦曾會同民調會主任委員任顯羣，向吳市長請示，經奉面論，為辦理征兵及配給之直接靈活起見，准照市參議會之決定，仍由戶籍機關直接受理遷徙登記，惟本市人口雜沓，變動又大，自治機關有賴於警察機關之協助正多，警察機關本身亦基於保安之需要，而須明瞭本市人口情形，甚望能依戶籍法施行細則第五條「現有警察地方，警察機關應指派員警協助戶政人員辦理査記……」之規定，多予協助，則戶政前途更有裨益云。</p>
<h3>又一警察手槍被奪</h3>

<h3>直系血親檢舉吸毒</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕地院刑庭邵人杰推事，昨審理兩無獨有偶之直系血親檢舉吸毒案，均當庭宣判：（一）徐德福檢舉其母親徐姚美英吸毒，判處徒刑六月。（二）盛杏生檢舉其子盛兆祺吸毒，判處徒刑一年六月。</p>

<h3>連江青芝寺　訪林故主席藏骨塔</h3>
<p>〔本報福州八日航訊〕林故主席辭世已經五年了，對於這位主持中樞近十載，深爲國內外人士欽敬的老人之死，其身後情况，當爲人所欲知。</p>
<p>老人平生澹泊好施，家無積餘，唯一興趣，喜與僧人方士交，在閩期間，半數時光耗於圍坐奕棋，煮茗談經之中，嘗遍遊邑中各寺院，諸如鼓山通泉寺，羅原聖水寺等，而獨對連江靑芝寺備致羡讚。二十餘年前，其時氏方任參議院院長後歸來，即預造藏骨塔一所於該山之陽，聲言死後必欲還葬於此山之中。自後氏每逢寫字賦詩，其簽名必皆署「靑芝老人」，老人對斯寺之愛好乃一至於此。抗戰軍興後，國府西撤，越五年，氏竟長病終其天年，中樞當時爲優禮此</p>
<p>一代元勛　不使靈體遠途搬運，遂下葬於陪都一山洞中。勝利後，閩父老對此事曾迭有建議，政院爲衡審權宜，准在閩靑芝寺改建一衣冠塚，並於月前撥款二億，飭屬具修，亦聊表中樞對革命元勛遺愛珍惜之意。當地父老，林氏鄉族，曁省建廳，已進行數度勘測矣。</p>
<p>記者於日前親詣該地踏勘，山在連江琯朗鎭，此鎭爲閩浙第一綫國道琯汾段起點，位於閩江之源，可以說是省會與閩東十餘縣之間的交通孔道，自福州乘汽艇三四小時可達。自琯朗鎭至山脚，約五里之遙，拾級而登，沿山西側頗饒</p>
<p>林石之勝　其間怪石嶙峋，奇峯突出，石洞纍纍，若蝙蝠洞，七虛洞皆爲洞中之佼佼者。另尙有「栩園」等別墅多間，環境均甚優美。靑之寺位於山之半巔，寺前古木參天，人內則兩楹雕漆常新，詢之万丈，據答：此爲民廿三年林氏返里時所建，寺分前中後三殿，裝璜均極雅緻，寺僧對林故當年軼事，敍述亦歷歷如繪。據稱往年每届林氏返鄕，鄉里必扶老携功前來歡迎。林氏尤喜於日麗風和之際，沿山下溯數十里，（據：林氏原籍尙幹鳳港村）登山賞物，彼在</p>
<p>青芝寺側　另闢有嘯餘別墅，上置一松風閣，每次駐此小住，靜觀浪游。該山前前後後，據吿凡一百零八景，其名有如「石觀音」「石象」，「三蟾蜍」，「石仙桃」，「大門洞」，「蘇武牧羊」，「仙人搖櫓」，等等，不可勝計，記者邀共陪伴，曾一一參觀。</p>
<p>午後，下山路勘藏骨塔，刻處離寺約數百武，係山傍一處台地，面積約數十丈，有短牆爲界，周圍林木葱鬱，古石生苔，極幽靜安謐之致。入口處有鐵欄横堵，鑲有鐵鎖，內則迴廊四繞，中矗石階五級，石塔三層，靑石砌成，工程尙精緻。塔正面有碑，鐫文日：「參議院院長林森存骨塔」，篆宗書成，字亦勁拔。餘則內除石凳數張，花欄數堵外，別無長物。壁間藤樹密，地角靑草叢生，另顯一番凄凉寂寞光景。據悉：未來之</p>
<p>「衣冠塚」　亦即擬就此加以整建完工。</p>
<p>歸來後，記者以此事詢諸參與修建計劃諸公，據吿：關於存骨塔部分，將該塔基四週加砌基石，使雨水魚致湘入損及基層，塔後則原野有三尺石洞一所，擬加整修作爲他年埋藏骨灰或放置衣冠之用。至正面碑石，擬侍名工改爲「國民政府林故主席衣冠塚」，反面碑石則以之改刻塚誌，藉炎永久。</p>
<p>嘯餘別墅　因靠山起藍，潮顯不宜，擬將山後嚴石予以鑿削數尺，並將屋面加高，另闢門窗，流通空氣，防制風雨侵襲。另據前往會同勘測之名石阡蔣源成稱：當年存骨塔，係由其經手建築，今則渠年已老，（六十七歲）無力親自動手，唯爲感前林故主席在世時知遇之恩，似願親返原籍南安一行，徵訪名手來此建造。全部建築費，由渠從省估計，約需十億數千萬元，不足之數，或由政院再行讚助，或即由其鄉人募集。蔣精神尙矍鑠，云當年南京中山陵閩省所獻石獅，亦出其手，爲林故主席生前最老「主顧」。（本報記者黄埀慶）</p>
<h3>鄞西暴發戶　王善康遭匪覬覦　妻被殺　夫被綁</h3>

<h3>許昌收復後　訪孫元良</h3>
<p>〔本報鄭州八日航訊〕記者由鄭州動身，滿想在收復許昌一天到了城，因爲那天收復的消息還沒有傳到我的耳中，不知道當天孫元良軍長同先頭部隊一同入城了。那天，有位專員向我們大家說：「孫軍長由四川出來，一到前綫，立刻打通了平漢綫，是馬到成功」。是的，孫軍長剛剛從重慶出來的，一舉就大獻身手。其實，在抗戰史上，他早寫上了廟行鎭一役，而使國際公認「此爲中國軍第一次與日軍作戰，而擊敗日本軍於戰塲」的光榮戰蹟，而最後在獨山南州等要地擊潰了日軍，又寫成了促成日軍崩潰的最後一頁，這一本抗戰史，好像由他來起筆，也由他來結筆的，非常巧合。</p>
<p>他劈頭吿訴記者：「過去，我們佔計匪的力量過低，因之有時不免吃了一些小虧，但是我們現在要把匪力量估計過高的，也是不對的」。他談話這樣爽快，馬上使人想起他在朮慶的時候，有人勸他治亂世，用重典，而他回答：「我是奉公守法的軍人，要合法，才能用重典」的話來。他不僅富理智，且極有熱誠。他告訴記者，在他進城的時候，受老百姓的歡迎，很是感動。</p>
<p>他還只四十四歲，非常英俊，這英俊一方面在他的談吐中表示出來，一方而在他的挺秀的外表顯露出來，是中國將領當中很不多得的。這兩年來，匪的搗亂，他很替中國難過，他認爲現在剿匪要打匪的主力，使匪沒法東竄西擾。他很樂觀，對任何一方面都是如此的。</p>
<p>孫軍長不吸烟，不飲酒，對人謙恭虛心，這些地方，都具有他的季父孫德操將軍的美德。他說愛北方，喜平原，這點就看出他的胸襟了，雖然他是生長在山地裏的。</p>
<p>許昌收復後，他希望外逃的人民，尤其負責地方的人士，趕快回去，因爲一切的事情，都要大家來幹，才幹得好。（本報記者范世勤）</p>

<h3>市塲流言助買　華股臨收轉俏</h3>
<p>華股昨晨疲午俏，一般迫於銀根之浮多及存賬，均有若干了結。但業中大戶及少壯份子得利補進，現遞息價竟迫近四角，中途有盤，臨收前助買流言之刺激，竟反動轉俏，臨收以高檔結束。</p>
<p>晨初續疲，永紗以一四〇五元及一四九〇登塲，旋即降爲一三八〇元及一四六五元低價。進者紛起，又升至一四一五元及一五〇二元。惟銀根仍緊，現遞越拔越開，不免有回。降爲一三九五元及一四八〇元。再被進出一四二八元及一五一八元，未幾又退至一四〇〇元及一四八三元。後以傳聞中行怠工，紗布大俏，加上减證公文已到等流言，人心再俏，紛紛吸取，臨收漲到一四二八元及一五二三元高價，而後以一四二八元及一五二二元收市。較前收即交股計中法景福中絲統益平平，永紗美亞信和華豐新光火柴中泥中紡閘北微升，華新新華國貨勤興景綸麗安永公榮豐微挫，內衣商務各漲半成，大通中興恒豐跌半成。遞交股華豐景福勤興微降，永紗信和新光美亞微升。塲外各未上市股票中國銀行跌半成爲最疲，華成尙穩，餘均微降。</p>
<h3>統債回跌　外股徵漲</h3>
<p>公債昨回跌若干，統丙自一二萬六起，降至一一萬六低價面後轉盤，較前收計甲乙丁各跌六千元，統丙降九千元，統戊挫七千元，成交約四百萬。</p>
<p>外股昨復向前邁進，怡紗自一七五萬起，回漲到一八六萬高價，而後轉盤。除電話微降外，以鋼業漲起較多，廣帮有所吸收，結果較前收計電話微挫，航業英聯怡紗漲半成，紙版尙平，怡平會德豐業廣微升，鋼業漲一成。</p>
<h3>押滙未予增加　鹽運前途危殆</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕記者頃自本市鹽運商方面獲悉，目下有關民食至鉅之鹽業，己遭逢一嚴重危機，緣本市鹽運商合計約一百五十餘家，戰前均賴銀行押匯週轉，數額約爲鹽本之七成，戰後通貨貶値，物價飛漲，鹽塲價格及蔴袋運費等無不昂騰，而「興貸銀團」現下所貸予豐運商之押匯，仍維以往情形，未予增加，竟低至不及鹽本之一成，致鹽商爲求增加資本，不得不以高利向外間貸款，利息二角餘，且需先付，故每隔一月，鹽本無形即增加二成至三成，以普通情形言，鹽自鹽塲出運至銷售，約需時四月，且有延擱至六·七個月者，按此計算，鹽本即增加百分之百以上。然鹽係指定銷售之貨物，售價及銷地均有限制，故鹽商出運銷售後，所得己無法再行購進同量之鹽，遂使鹽量逐次减少，一面影響鹽塲鹽民之生計，及民食需用，一面對國家稅收損失甚巨，同時鹽務當局爲平日儲備調節所辦理之「常平鹽」，用意極佳，然以數量超過限區銷額過巨，亦使鹽運商感受打擊，故本市鹽運商咸盼政府能密切注意此危機，對鹽運商之押匯能與鹽本，運費單樣提增，俾可增加運鹽數量，供應民食，充裕國家稅收。</p>
<h3>配米普遍供應後　米市銷路已呆滯　昨南北市米價一致回跌</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕米價昨普遍下跌，（一）因銀根抽緊，（二）因產地報小，（三）因全面配米後實銷淸淡，貨主競相求售，價格一再抑低，然因戶口米之加强配出，全市已普遍供應，米店門銷，以戶口米爲主，不需向市上補納，是以去路倍見呆滯，加以到貨有增，呈有售乏銷之概。北市塲白粳退至三百七十萬，薄稻爲三百六十萬元，羊秈三百六十五萬，特高粳以三百八十萬元成交，各降十餘至二十萬。然至收市時，市况更見不支，有下退二十萬以上者。南市場開市即見下墜，後更加厲，幾至乏人問津。薄稻三百六十萬，後有低至三百五十萬者，昨到貨南北二市共計一萬〇五百五十六石。</p>
<p>麵粉　在米價跌，銀根緊，及外埠價亦回低之下，市亦跟踵下落。貨主因需款而求售不絕，實銷則因市勢趨跌而不敢貿然多進，價在供多化呆下，挫跌三四萬元。交易平淡。</p>
<p>雜糧　漲跌不一，黄豆跟米價下降，人心虛軟，客帮胃閉，貨主以銀根緊而已感無九扳特矣。漢口乍豆退至一百七十五萬元，計降十八萬元，後市尙虛。平湖杜豆亦降五萬至七八萬元，苞米靑島帮重生納胃，初市激升，後市稍疲，尙軋升十五萬。紅糧貨少，漲十萬，菉豆亦昂升，芝蔴天津帮來納，升二十萬，漢口白蔴三百七十萬元，生仁上漲殊勁，廣帮力吸，秦皇島生仁突出五百萬關，計漲五六十萬元。</p>
<p>食油　開始回跌，因各糧俱降，人心看低，本街納胃不多，一部份散戶乘高脫手，故開市即吿降落二十五萬。大有餘及大統二廠俱以六百九十五萬之價開出豆油，回籠交易亦多，大有豆油後六百九十五買不進，生油出戶較豆油爲少，靑島吉桶生油先開八百萬，後八百十萬元，略低十五萬元，論脚地則較豆油爲堅也。生菜油回籠貨六百八十五萬元，亦跌二十餘萬。小車蔴油初開七百七十萬，後回至七百八十萬，計降二十萬元。豆餅油帮納懈，價隨汕價而下降，四牌餅各削三四萬元。</p>

<h3>棉紗疲軟　布疋下挫</h3>
<p>昨日棉紗市况，因市上供給籌碼增加，同業中銀根緊縮，客帮辦意懈怠，浮戶續有吐售，市價繼續下挫。惟細紗在近收時複製業趁低稍有補進，故最後四十二支藍壓細紗，曾見下跌後即回上至原盤一億七千七百萬元，與上日軋平。</p>
<p>四十支藍鳳細紗，則軋升一百萬元左右，卅二支雙股豐年亦升二百萬元。此外廿一支雙馬棧單，午收浮多有售，步瀉一百萬元，現貨亦跌百萬元。二十支以下各級紗，行情大都再跌五六十萬至三五百萬不一。</p>
<p>昨日棉布市况，晨開因銀根聚迫，買戶不斷斬結，更逢紡建公司開額充裕，市呈供過於求，大戶乘高出檔，紗花帮相繼出籠，客帮之絀於頭寸者，亦有脫手，同業撳壓甚勁。十二磅龍頭細布行情一路下瀉，慘跌至三百四十九萬元收市，較之上日疾退二十四萬元。</p>
<p>振中彩球五福等細布，亦挫十五萬至卅萬元，惟收後突傳港電續縮，紗價回秀，人心轉變，喊價重見上升，龍頭現貨回高至三百五十五萬元有成交，餘亦比收價爲高。全日趨勢，四君子直貢嗶嘰及組布細斜等，價均下挫二·三十餘萬元，惟元布藍布及士林布，脚地尙覺穩固。</p>
<h3>絲經交易平淡　綢貨一致疲軟</h3>
<p>人造絲昨市始疲終又回堅，結果與上日行情相仿，一二〇號旭字有光，上午開盤喊二億元，中間大至二億〇三百萬元，午收降至即期一億九千八百萬元，週一期爲二億〇八百萬元，下午最大曾做一千四百萬元，最後又降爲二億〇八百萬元賣出價。</p>
<p>廠經　昨市因週六，交易極靜，更因上日行情稍挫，實銷戶均呈觀望，故乏做開，高另拒二億八千萬元有一二担交易，各級廠絲及干經喊價，俱與上日相仿。</p>
<p>綢貨　昨市跌降，華强眞絲被面開市即在一億元關內，旋因原料稍軟，人心不免虛弱，行情直瀉，最小降至九千三百萬元左右，收市稍升，爲九千七百萬元即日期，格子璧縐最小跌進四十萬元關內，收市做四十一萬元，其餘各貨，均略呈疲軟。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕中信局易貨處昨（十三）日發表本月八日至十二日之桐油猪鬃市况如下：</p>
<p>桐油　本週美國一般物價雖有跌落，桐油價格頗爲穩定。紐約現貨每磅美金二角五分半，上海發價裝船散艙油每磅C&amp;F紐約高至美金二角五分，但未做開。倫敦桶裝油每長噸C&amp;F英鎊一九〇鎊。國內價格因近來物價一致上漲不已，桐油隨之而漲，上海每市担六，三〇〇，〇〇〇元，僅囤戶有小量吸進。漢口自開五，〇〇〇，〇〇〇元新價後，亦只有小量成交。重慶三，九五〇，〇〇〇元，萬縣三，七〇〇，〇〇〇元，廣州六，五二〇，〇〇〇元，梧州六，二〇〇，〇〇〇元，照目前紐約市價，按出口匯票率，結得國幣，與上海市價比較，尙不數成本約二四％。</p>
<p>猪鬃　本週國外猪鬃價格微軟，計重慶二七號黑配鬃C&amp;F紐約每磅美金二，二〇元，漢口一七號黑配鬃三，二〇元，上海一七號黑配鬃二，一〇元，天津小五五黑配鬃四，九〇元。國內價格均一致增漲，計重慶二七號黑配鬃渝價每關祖六四〇〇萬元，漢口一七號黑配鬃漢價八，〇〇〇萬元，上海一七號黑配鬃六五〇〇萬元，天津小五五黑配鬃一六，五〇〇萬元。</p>
<h3>捲菸徵挫</h3>
<p>昨日捲菸市况，初開以同業納胃尙健，喊價曾吿挺秀，旋有浮多乘高出籠，同時華成烟公司派銷美麗金鼠兩烟，行盤美麗五萬支派價一億元，金鼠六千萬元，塲內拋貨奇多，市上供源充沛，市勢頓吿疾退。最後十支大英及老刀烟比上日續跌二百五十萬至三百萬元，惟熱銷貨美麗金鼠全祿百萬金紅金紅人等華商烟則見回升五千至一萬五千元，其餘中外各烟均步下挫</p>

<h3>敦煌莫高窟</h3>
<p>在蘭州西一千二百餘公里的敦煌，自秦漢南北朝隨唐以迄宋代，像現在上海一樣的繁盛，是中西文化經濟政治的交流地。在這邊陲荒漠裏的綠州上的「莫高窟」，像蜂窩般的修築在城東南四十里地一道山溝的縣崖上。這祖先　留給我們的寶藏，值得我們欽佩前人的勳功偉業。在歷史的考據上，文化學術，宗敎藝術，社會狀況等，是具着無比的價值。</p>
<p>自一九〇七年英人斯坦因從印度到甘肅西部時，携走了大批的古代寫本經畫古物等到達倫敦後，接着法人漢學家伯希和也特地趕來取去了大批的文物以後，這着法人漢學家伯希和也特地趕來取去了大批的文物以後，這許多文獻，在那時震驚了全世界的文壇，在那些文獻中，也糾正了許多歷史上的錯誤記載，和縮短了研究歷史的路程。</p>
<p>現在留在那裏全長一千六百十二公尺的一千多窟的實職，祇有三百零九窟寧不動運不走的壁畫和塑像，仍是全世界上蘊藏最豐富最完整最有系統的文物。</p>
<p>這全長可以展開至二十五公里的壁畫，二千多個塑像，自北魏，西魏，隋唐，五代，以至宋元，都代表了第一個時代的不同作風，魏代的作品，是豪放，單調，奇物，毫無拘束，係初期作風的形式，經過短短隨代至初唐，已有着顯著的變化，到盛唐期，已到了最成熟的階段，那綫條的美臻，輪廓的準確，設色的富麗，搆圖的完美，達到了藝術的最高峯。到晚唐五代以迄宋元，隨着時代的變遷和政治經濟的衰落，並受宗敎藝術業已形成範疇的影響，也變成了軟弱無力粗製濫造的作品了。</p>

<h3>論批評</h3>
<p>— 許人</p>
<p>嚴格說來，我們實在並沒有資格議論他人。何以故？我不妨在此提出兩個理由。第一，人孰無過？一個人在數十寒暑中要沒有一件錯失，他一定是自出生時起已經是神化了的。我們日常有許多議論他人的話，仔細思之，不啻是五十步笑百步，形式上是講議他人，事實上即是在誹議自己的影子。第二，天下的是非，初不如想像的那麼易於斷定。莊子便早已說過「此亦一是非，彼亦一是非」的話。但讀中外古今的各類學說，對於任何問題，總不免分做「積極說」，「消極說」，及「折衷說」。海格爾的「正，反，合」哲學，也無非說明是非乃是相對的，乃是無時不在變易中的。所以我們要建立絕對的是非之標準，正非易事。</p>
<p>是故非至萬不得已之時，我們應該切戒信口論人論事的積習。即使對人對事欲有所論列，我們也必須以積極性的態度出之。我們要知道：批評乃是一種建設，並不是一種破壞。俗諺所謂「駡人」一事，實在是不作爲訓的。惡意的駡人，被駡者固不甘心悅誠服，在駡的人又能獲得些什麽結果呢？</p>
<p>建設性的批評與破壞性的批評，我們用什麼標準去加以區別呢？筆者認爲建設性的批評須具有兩個條件。第一，批評之動機非出於私利；第二，批評之態度必須一本於善意。如果以自身的利害爲出發點去批評他人，則觀點不免錯誤，好像是戴了有色眼鏡去看人，要得到正確的結論，蓋也難了。比方去年自由談刊過一張豐子愷先生的漫畫，一隻貓偸吃了一條魚，盟先生的說明就是貓之貧吃，還是因爲沒有吃飽的緣故，其過還在於人。故五人於責人論事之際，必得以對方之立場爲立塲，設身處地替對方想一想，這樣庶幾可以獲得批評之正論。若不然者，則其情已惑，其心已不正，說出來的話不免只是漫薷，不能名之曰批評了。</p>
<p>說得嚴格一些，只有建設性的批評才是眞正的批評。須知批評並不旨在發洩，而在於事情之改善。是故說話的人，若是志在破壞，考其動機，必出於私利，其說出來的話自然只是快一己之私意，逞一已之私見罷了，又何濟於事情之改善？看看當前的言論，我們知道旨在發洩的論調調太多，旨在改善的論調太少。結果自然是破壞之處多於建設了。</p>
<p>我們須知破壞的事此較容易，建設的事則便大難；旁觀的人發發議論是很容易的，當其事者的辦起事來其困難往往有非身歷其境的人所能想像者。俗諺「他人挑担不知其吃力，」即是這個意思。是故吾人於議人論事之際，必須以極其謹愼的態度出之。古人「蓋棺論定」一語，蓋是一人在其生時總尙須觀其後效云耳。</p>
<p>今人之議人論事，往往失之過於籠統。比方在目前通貨膨脹的局面之下，人與人相遇，總不免說些消極的話。今日經濟情形之嚴重，自有無可諱言者，只是仔細研究一下，却也沒有如一般人想像的那麽嚴重。你知當前物價固然高漲，對於許多人固是一種莫大的威脅，可是今日社會上有許多的人，其收入已多有超越其戰前同樣事務之收入者。今日有些人但知物價高漲，而忘了自己的收入之豐厚，因而發些「怨天尤人」的論調，共居心又何在呢？再說經濟崩潰的問題，竊以爲國人素重中庸之道，在本質上有不容易崩潰的潛在力，此其一；我國乃是農業社會，在今日的鄕村中經濟往往以實物爲本位，受通貨變易之影響可謂並不太大，是其二。今日的經濟乃是一個生產問題，不是通貨問題。據個人觀察所知，今日有些人對於通貨問題之囂囂然不可終日者，其問恐不無作惡意之預測之徒，蓋手中囤貨極多，惟恐物價之不漲，通貨之不崩潰也。</p>
<p>西人有「批評即同情」之論。推想其旨，亦無非「替對方設身處地想一想」之意。是故惟有善意的批評才是眞正的批評，惟有建設性的批評才能對於社會發生改良的效果。</p>
<h3>俗語有本</h3>
<p>— 蔣端生</p>
<p>里巷長談，本於史書者甚多，人多習用而不察。如能稍予稽考，必能興趣盎然，亦可知無一字無出典來歷矣。如俗語「不中用」，出史記，秦始皇聞盧生竊議亡去，大怒曰：「吾前收天下書，不中用者盡去之。」又「一敗塗地」及「無賴」，俱見高祖本紀中；「不耐煩」見宋庚炳之傳，又五代唐明宗將立后曹氏，謂王淑妃曰：「我素多病，性不耐煩，妹當代我。」駡人曰「雜種」，出前燕載記贊曰：「蠢茲雜種，沒奈何！」俗云隱跡曰：「畔」，陳後主時，有謠曰：「齊雲觀，寇來無處處畔。」事穩當曰「妥帖」，杜甫詩有「千里初妥帖」之句；饋人曰「作人情」，杜甫詩有「粗籹作人情」之句；虛而少實曰「空頭」，出北史斛律金傳，有「空頭漢合殺」之句；習氣曰「毛病」，黃山谷刀筆云：「此荆南人毛病。」熱而不甚曰「溫暾」，白樂天詩有「池水暖溫暾」之句；至於俗以購物云「買東西」，余考諸古書，終不能得其來歷，諒係傳訛所致，惟據兎園册載：「崇禎中思陵設游藝堂，爲涉覽文史地，有所疑，輒使中官問之詞臣，一日忽命中官間詞臣曰：「今市肆交易，止言買東西，而不及南北何也？」詞臣猝無以對。輔臣周延儒曰：「南方火，北方水，晨昏叩人之門戶求水火無不與者，此不待交易，故惟言買東西。」中官以其言入奏，思陵善之。」又余偶閱前人筆記，記得也有論及此云：「東主生發，西主收歛，或取東作西成之意。」以上二說，似頗合理。此外又以物多藏於東西向之室內，於是稱物云「東西」，則有牽强之處，似未可信，特書之以俟博識。</p>

<h3>逍遙花</h3>
<p>— 陳慎言</p>
<p>第十二章　萍水姻緣（九七）</p>
<p>島雲又接着說道：「我要組織一個製片公司，一切管理支配等等，我希望顧小姐能和我通力合作」。綺紈道：「祗怕我沒有能力吧？」島雲道：「祗要顧小姐對這事業有興趣，便帮我不少的忙。」綺紈道：「我對電影很有興趣。」島雲道：「那就不成問題了，顧小姐可以和我到上海去嗎？」綺紈道：「我有這種計劃。」島雲道：「那末，我不必在北平再物色第二個人才，有顧小姐帮忙，我的事便可放大膽幹去。」綺紈道：「我站在側而帮忙可以，單靠我撑塲面可不行。我是沒有資財，沒有能力的。』島雲道：「關於資本方面，我早已計劃好了，現在所討論的就是人才方面。旣有顧小姐撑台柱，我心裏已有把握。在上海方面再有幾位配角，我的片子，便吿成功。」說着，又把籌備經過，已經化了多少錢，出品復可以掙多少錢，滔滔說個不絕。又說電影事業，照他這種辦法幹去，將來擴充起來，可以執電影界牛耳；又說香港某某財東，都和他有聯絡，只要這次出品，能博大多數觀衆歡迎，要運用多少少本，都右後援的。那晚島雲在綺紈屋內，談到九點多鐘，醫院的看護前來吿訴他，已到安歇時間，島雲方才出去。綺紈經他如此一說，心裏很是興奮，覺得島雲這人，幹才和資力，比渚齋都勝了一籌，祗是他一向在南方慣了，說話似不及渚齋那樣誠實可靠，但也不能怪他，凡是在講生意經，就不能都實說話。他說和我合作，當然別有用意，我祗靜以待動，看他還有什麽條件，再相繼進行。綺紈爲了島雲這一篇話，弄得這一夜顚顚倒倒，想了一夜，沒得好睡。第二日才有八點多鐘，綺紈還沒起床，就聽得房門外有人輕輕叩門，綺紈以爲是看護，便應一聲，「我醒了，你進來吧。」及房門推開，却是島雲，穿了一身睡衣，走了進來。一面走一面口裏說道：「對不住，我不知顧小姐還沒起來，昨夜爲了想起一宗事，不能解決，一夜沒睡，今天天一亮，就想過來，又不敢過來，以爲這時候，顧小姐已經起床了。」島雲說時，已走到綺紈床前，見綺紈媚眼含情脈脈，看着他，微笑問道：「你爲什麽事睡不着？」</p>
<h3>校門之外</h3>
<p>— 念鴻</p>
<p>提起讀書，似乎就想到學校；提起求學，便連想到敎師。傳統的觀念支配了我們，形成了一套要讀書求學，非進學校請益敎師不可的邏輯。</p>
<p>這幾天正是各在中學紛紛開學的時節，由於學費的昂貴，獎學金獲得的困難，失學的靑年一定很多，徘徊於校門外，眼看往日同窗負笈報到註册，心中定然很難過，甚至因而怨憤無已，悲觀消極。爲家長的也覺得不能讓子女受到完全的敎育，似乎非常慚愧，負疚深重，總彷彿對不起他們的第二代。這種心理，就是前述那種傳統觀念的結果，實在是不必作如此想的。</p>
<p>我並不是說措大們毋庸讀書，而是說不必一定要擠在學校裏看人學樣，化上許多金錢云混什麽文憑證件。我們要學的只是眞學問眞本領，家長希望子弟們的也只是一技之長明白事理。試看即使是中學畢業了或大學畢業了的，是不是都有眞學問，眞本領，一技之長和明白事理呢？</p>
<p>這倒絕不是吃不着葡萄說葡萄酸，進不了學校說學校壞，自已寬慰自己的想法。事實明顯地放在眼前，連敎育家們都覺得這樣的敎育，實有改革的必要，那末又何必一定戀戀於它，徒然自苦！學校之外的天地大得很，可以學習的時與地也寬得很，何不轉移觀察一下四周一望無際的實生活，在生活中學習，鍜鍊自己，充實自己。</p>
<p>固然今天的學校也不安定，但和社會比起來，究竟覺得太安逸了。靑年人應該有蹈艱危而不懼的勇氣，今日的社會是陰暗的，但決不能因其陰暗而躱在一隅圖片刻的苟安，社會本身便是一所大學校，這是老話，旣然如此，便在這學校裏好好地學些眞學問。</p>
<p>經驗就是本領，而這種本領永遠不能在書本裏唸到，惟有從生活中才能積聚得來。何况脫離了學校，並不等於脫離了書本。相反的，正可以從己所好地多看些好書，繼續學習上進；而敎師也並不僅限於穿着長衫拿了粉筆，在講堂上指手劃脚的敎員，能够在生活中學習的，所有的人都可能是他的老師。孔老夫子說的話，難道沒有聽到過麼？這裏也不想舉什麼某某是自學成功，某某並沒有進過學校之類的例子，反正這些偉人的出身，也是人人都熟悉的了。</p>
<p>失學也罷，大踏步跨進現社會裏去！</p>
<p>黃海戲與太湖花　半夢老人</p>
<p>「一齣爭看黄海戲，萬枝齊放太湖花，平生得見天然美，不覺靈根怒茁芽。」此余舊咽游山歸來之詩。吾人除衣食住行之外，當以「游」爲第一。局處一隅，終日忙忙，不知所忙何事。余之所謂黄海者，即言安徽徽州之黄山，其中奇景天成，皆出人意料之外，牠的深隱處，都名曰海，所以名「海」的緣故，就因海中有珊瑚島等種種奇形怪狀的結晶，非人力所可製造，幾千萬年，變成不可思議之狀態，黄山低處，亦均包孕此等千奇百怪之物象，古人無以形容之，總名之曰海，故又曰黄海；其中有前海後海天海西海等，後海在獅子峯之後，奇形怪狀之山峯尤多。黄海之峯，有名美人對鏡的，有名關公擋曹的，有名達摩渡江的，有名姊妹放羊的，大抵無一不像，隨人所指定而題名，約有一百幾十處。余前時游至此處，輒爲之拍案呌絕，故稱牠爲「黄海戲」。世間人做的戲，無非假託才子佳人，演一齣怨女痴男，或者虎鬭龍爭，來一番殺人放火，幾千萬年，總逃不出歷史所載的事實。即使翻倒轉來，臣弑君，子弑父，背倫滅義，如禽獸一般的凶猛，或者演出流血革命來，也不過在這世界上打了一個怪誕的鞦韆，看慣了，畢竟是嚼蠟無味的。</p>
<p>黄海戲之外，還有「太湖花」，必不可不看。東南巨浸，第一要算太湖，牠的面積，古稱「汪洋三萬六千頃，沈浸七十有二峯」。湖中最大的，即是洞庭西山，牠的最高處名爲縹緲峯，縹緲峯附近有數山，風景最好的，名石公山，在太湖中遙望石公，約似仙山樓閣，一經天然金碧圖畫。登山處，有漱石居，再進歸雲洞，洞中易實甫題詩云：「石公山畔此勾留，水國春寒尙似秋，天外有天，泛艇，客中為客怕登樓。烟彼浩蕩連千里，風物凄淸似十洲，細雨梅花正愁絕，笛聲何處起漁謳。」前有石公禪院，上爲來鶴亨，外有夕光洞，來鶴亨爲全山佳處。洞庭西山對面為洞庭東山，東山最高處，名莫釐峰，但不及西洞庭佳美。兩洞庭之外，又有馬磧山，亦可稱雄湖上。吾鄕儲簡翁有一章，刻「風雨埀簾看馬山」七字。簡翁又屬余書「鼇嘴」「王屛」「雲根」「雪浪」「大雄台」等，計三十餘摩厓，刻於香山大雷灣石壁上。當時曾題名其下云：「簡翁雲石崔髯同游石公林屋，登標緲莫釐兩絕頂，盡攬湖中形勝，歸過此間，艤舟直下，題雲根雪浪兩佳石，繼而遍題諸石，西及玉苔，凡三十餘處，使咸有佳名，以便後之游者。壬申十月之望。」此事距今已十餘年矣，未知尙有存焉否耳。要看「太湖花」，當以大雷灣爲最。何爲太湖花？凡太湖中之漁船，順風張帆，其最大者有七帆之多，縱横排列，遙望之如一花七瓣，有時往來船至數十，幾若羣葩怒放，開遍全湖，可稱洋洋大觀。在三萬六千頃之烟波中，有此巨大畫面，安得不拍案呌絕！大雷灣屬於宜興與浙江長興之交界處，在太湖中可稱極西，漁船大都由西而來，或由東而西，乘風張帆，必經大雷灣之前，故看太湖花，須在大雷灣之公路上。從前儲簡翁曾於其地建築牌坊四座，爲游人停息之處，亂後景象如何，不得而知。</p>
<p>凡吾人感想，每從環境爲變遷，若四顧瀉泬，天地寂寥，箇人默處其中，必有不可思議之波動。在宗敎家，正宜從極玄極默處，探發自心變化之寳藏，蓋以吾人心地，爲境地所逼張，無從爲散漫銷蝕之投泊，團聚精神，振奮直前，遂因而開出怪誕奇異之境界。此等境界，非身心切實經歷者，不能知之，且亦不必需人知之。梁任公自由書，曾載有世界外之世界一篇，中述「狄西將軍征埃及，有騎士逃至浩浩沙漠中，萬籟無聲，乾坤寂寥，極目一望，茫無涯際，寂寥之餘，萬感湧動，每日必有無數之新感想，陡起陡落，不能自禁，於孤身隻影人聲全寂之間，忽開出自然之秘密藏，得不可思議之感悟。太陽出沒，禽鳥迴翅，種種色相，映於眼簾，其心藏必緣之而浮一新想。一輪孤月，光閃沙際，四望燦爛，凉風簸沙，自成波綫，動漾無息。時或暴風怒號，峨峨沙柱，捲立寥空者以百數，俄焉風息，星斗闌干，爽氣頓生，恍如聽空中矞皇微妙之天樂，自謂此中樂趣，爲生平所未遇，愉快有不足爲外人道者。」可知荒寂無人之境，另有特殊趣味。太湖中有一荒灘，約數畝大，名爲北歸，上有禹王廟一所，屋祗十餘間，院中樹木茂盛，中立一竿，約十餘丈高，爲懸旗之用。守廟人李姓，已居此數代，食用絕時，則縣旂，自有漁舟來送資糧，余到北歸時，在灘邊閒步，所見風帆沙鳥，寥闊無際，日光照水，射出金光，遠近數十里間，奪人目睛，風景奇麗，不可名狀。靜坐灘上片時，便發生種種感想，正與埃及騎士所處之境相類，可惜守廟李姓，未曾讀書，負此世界妙境耳。</p>
<h3>如何改進上海之市內電話</h3>
<p>— 萍</p>
<p>—摘録郁局長在交通大學演講詞</p>
<p>上海之有電話，始黨前淸光緒緒七年，英商瑞記洋行在前公共租界內創設華洋德律風公司，先後以磁石式及共電式機件使用，惟時有越界電綫之舉，前清督辦電政大臣於光緒卅二年自行設立上海電話話局於南市，以保全主權，光緒卅三年成立，採用磁石式話機，宣統元年增設閘北分局，民國七年籌備建設滬寗長途電話，分設南市，閘北，浦東三處，八年購買地基，選定中國電氣公司承辦各種機料，南市改設共電式交換機容置二千號，閘北分局磁石式交換機容量七百號，浦東分局磁石式交換機容量二百八十號，九年選定上海久記營造廠承造房屋，十年二月設立女話生養成所，練習接綫事務，六個月畢業，同時開辦內外工程，十一年開始通話，十四年與華洋德律風公司會訂接綫合同，十五年二月開始接綫，十九年間該公司出售與今之美商上海電話公司，改用旋轉式目動話機，同時國民政府爲發展上海電話起見，向美國自動電氣公司訂購步進式自動機四千八百號，於南市局設三千號，改建閘北分局設一千五百號，添設市中心分局設三百號，於廿二年間裝竣通話，並先後與上海電話公司簽定臨時合約，及長途合同，至抗戰期間敵僞除將南市閘北等局機件遷移及損壞外，在虹口添設步進式自動電話局址一所，現均由交通部上海電信局盡力恢復中。</p>
<p>上海市目前之電話機構，一爲國營，一爲外商經營，旣如上述，兩者組織分歧，制度各異，不特於管理上發生困難，且於經濟原則復多未合，致本市電話效率，難臻盡善，市民不能享受滿意之服務，爲補救上項缺憾增進電話效率，曁謀全市電話制度之合理化起見，似須有一統一管理之機構，俾較妥善，此項機構之成立，不外下列四種辦法：（一）上海市外商經營之電話機構，由中國政府出資收回國營，（二）上海全市電話統由外商經營，（三）中美雙方合資，遵照中國法律組織特種有限公司，（四）中美雙方合作，各在其規定之營業區域內分別經營改進。</p>
<p>其間除第一種辦法外，値茲國家電款支絀時期，恐難於短期內實現，第二種辦法，事關我國主權，未便置議外，第三種辦法，中美雙方合資遵照中國法律合組有限公司，雖具有：機構統一，程式劃一，易於擴充以及用戶納費得劃一公允等優點，但依目前情况，實行尙有困難，需時亦復不少，故收效恐不若第四種中美合作辦法之逕捷也。</p>
<p>茲就管見所及，將第四種中美合作辦法，分條縷述如下：（甲）方式，中美雙方分工合作，各在其規定之營業區域內，分別經營，（乙）營業權，中國政府允許美商上海電話公司於依照中國法律改組後，在前公共租界及前法租界區域內，繼續經營市內電話若干年，並應按交通部所頒民營市內電話設置規則，另行發給執照，（丙）臨時合約，民國廿二年四月十九日交通部上海電話局與上海電話公司，上海市公用局三方面訂立之臨時合約，應於本辦法訂定後取銷之，公司應一即將該合約內所指之前越界築路各區域，移交交通部方面，改作該部所屬上海電信局營業區域之一部份，（丁）機件程式，交通部爲謀上海全市電話機器程式之統一並表示合作起見，似可將電信用局現之步進式自動電話機鍵及接收越界築路區域內之共電式人工電話機器，遷往他處應用，本市區內，一律改用旋轉式自動機，（戊）互通電話，上海電信局用戶與美商電話公司用戶互通市內電話時，應完全採用自動直接呌號辦法，雙方並以不另向用戶加收話費爲原則，（己）長途電話接綫費，公司對於其用戶之長途電話費，可由用戶直接向電信局繳納，或由公司照電信局按月所送之去話帳單義務代收，話費全數轉付電信局，（庚）立案，公司應在中國交通部經濟部立案，並在上海市政府登記，關於商事行爲受經濟部監督指導，關於業務行爲受交通部監督指導，關於道路進行工程事項，受上海市政府監督指導，（辛）營業期限，公司營業期限及交通部對於公司之監督及收歸國營辦法，悉依交通部所頒民營市內電話設置規則及今後修正者之規定辦理。</p>
<p>綜觀上列四種辦法，如第一種及第三種辦法暫時不克實現，則爲便利市民增進通話效率起見，第四種中美合作辦法，似有採用之價値，至究應如何擷長捨短以期改善上海之電話事業，仍有賴於有關當局暨海內賢達之宏敎也。</p>

<p>「音書瞬息傳千里，海角天涯若毘鄰」電信交通，正因其有如此之迅速與便利，在戰時配合作戰，負起聯絡指揮之使命，在平時溝通文化，促進社會之繁榮，苟使電信一日而停頓，則消息隔閡，文化阻塞，整個國家必將陷於不堪設想之境地，是故其在國防上與文化經濟上之地位，十分重要，且隨時代之進步日益顯著，勝利以還，百廢俱興，而吾電信事業之振興，豈敢後人，爰臚列兩年來本局電報業務之進展，觀今憶昔，藉勵來滋。</p>
<p>（一）大量充實內部</p>
<p>本局接收敵僞華中電氣通信公司時，戰前原有設備，俱遭破壞，而接收之機件又多陳窳簡陋，經積極整修，大量添置，直至現在，設備方面比接收時已增加三倍至五倍，電路方面已增加三倍至六倍之多。</p>
<p>關於有綫電方面：目前本局有綫直達電路，遠達華北，華南，戰時所有支幹各綫，破壞殆盡，敵僞華中時期有綫電路亦僅限於京滬杭三角地帶，故自接收伊始即規劃調度，次第增添，現計有韋氏快機九路，音響機三路，話傳電路八路合計二十路，惟以戰火未戢，一時尙難恢復舊觀，而且漢口徐州等綫，雖經修復仍時遭破壞，故大部份報務咸有賴於無綫電路之維持。</p>
<p>關於無綫電方面：戰後本局無綫電報務，突飛猛晋，舉凡通都大邑，遠及全國各地，無不聯絡貫通，惟無綫通訊，因受氣候及干擾影響，不若有綫之穩定，且報務繁重，常常超過其本身之容量，勢必增闢二路三路，以資疏導，故無綫電路增闢特多，計快機八路，人工機廿三路，合計卅一路，較敵僞時之寥寥無幾者自有天壞之別。</p>
<p>此外復添置各種最新設備，如傳眞機，電傳打字機，新式波紋收信機等均爲現代最新穎的通訊工具。</p>
<p>（二）增强工作效能</p>
<p>抗戰時不論大後方或淪陷區，一張電報的傳遞，有時需要時間很久，勝利初期電報遲緩和錯誤也是當有的事，現在電報可以暢達全國。在數量方面：戰前本一局每日來去電報僅祗數千餘通，而現在則有時多至三萬份以上。最近正陸續添闢無綫快機電路，使電報之傳達容量增加。在速率方面：復規定各種電報傳遞時限，特快電報只要一小時半就可到達，就是尋常電報在直達電路中，也規定六小時內送達，至於準確方面其準確率要比戰時高得多，平均能誤百分比也僅佔百分之〇·一一五，為了肅清電報錯誤起見，現在已加强校對工作，對來云轉報報底已派有專人逐日抽查，以期切實做到正確無悮。</p>
<p>（三）擴展公眾服務</p>
<p>勝利後上海與各地之通訊交通，日趨重要，本局於機件人手兩感缺乏極度困難環境中，在「服務大衆」「便利顧客」之目標下努力工作，日求進步，因此在業務方面，開放特快電報，以應急需，恢復交際電報，及附贈禮券辦法以利酬應，還有旅行電報，便利行旅，夜信電報經濟實惠，均可供大衆選擇使用，關於便利顯客方面：除積極增設分營業處和代辦所十九處外，復在車站碼頭交通要道設置電亭多處，並有行動電局之設置，以汽車行駛全市俾市民得隨時隨地拍發電報，更爲服務週到計，在營業處設置公衆服務台，幷爲增進電報投送速度，便利掛號用戶，實行六碼掛號，且舉辦電話拍發電報及電話通知收取電報，免費代譯來報等等莫不爲大衆服務着想，而且經常有業務稽査員對外解答各方疑問，隨時訪問用戶徵詢意見，以謀改善。</p>
<p>今日之電報業務，雖略有一些成績，但仍未能盡如人意，尙望國人多予合作，俾臻完善。</p>
<h3>物價的波動與穩定</h3>
<p>— 蘇予</p>
<h3>中英通話典禮來賓簽名處吳市長簽名時情形</h3>
<p>— 蔡南式攝</p>
<h3>中英無綫電話　開放通話前後</h3>
<p>— 斯繩</p>
<p>籌備情形　中英兩國在政治，經濟，文化諸方面均有至爲密切之關係，而兩國友好精神之合作推進，有賴於電信交通，故中英無綫電話之開放，實寓有重大之意義。遠在民國二十六年春季，交通部國際電台與英國郵電總局接洽開放無綫電話業務，積極籌備，不料正擬通話之際，八一三中日事變發生，因機件破壞，電台西遷，通話業務遂致停頓。</p>
<p>勝利後，在上海電信局與國際電台之合作下，中美間首先於七月一日恢復通話，一方面再向國外訂購新式單邊帶無綫電話機運滬，中英間便自本年二月三日起逐日開始試話，雙方機件均採雙路單邊帶即同時可開放兩路電話。因此，話音極為清晰。為防止天空氣壓變化特殊，或有欠暢情形，並擬添加30KW雙路單邊帶强力擴大機，將輸出電力由二瓩增至三十瓩，以利通話。</p>
<p>真茹發訊臺機房之一部</p>
<p>設備之特點　爲使長途無綫電話能接至普通雙綫之有綫電話起見，必須使用特別之接綫設備，方能使此無棧電話聯絡效能，得以充分表現。通達無綫電話之二端，必各有相當距離之收發訊台，此項無綫電路，計分收話與發話二路，每路等於有綫電路之雙綫，故有四綫，經終端機之功能，即可復爲雙綫，而可與普通電話用戶相聯接通話。</p>
<p>因無綫電話，較有綫電話繁複，有綫電路所常用之分綫圈裝置，不敷無綫電路之用，須用無綫電終端機之設備。該終端機內有自動調整話音電流裝置，雖用戶聲浪高低不同，仍能調節均勻音量，傳至無綫電發射機發射之。並有繼電器一組，可爲電話用戶話聲所控制，俾全部話路內，任何回聲或呌聲，得以避免。</p>
<p>又終端機內有自動音量控制器（簡稱“VOGAD”）及自動减免呌聲控制器（簡稱　VODAS），上項自動减免呌聲控制器，係聯接收發話共用秘密設備。此種秘密設備之功能，係將話音電波改變，俾任何其他收聽無綫電話者，不能聽淸。</p>
<p>通話儀式　中英通話儀式於三月四日假續浜橋上海電信局會議室舉行。會塲正中懸兩巨幅中英國旗，四壁懸中英小國旗。五時三十分，儀式開始，首由郁局長致詞，及國際電台盧管理工程師報吿籌備經過，繼由吳市長與倫敦前往市長現任倫敦商會主席施密斯通話。兩市長結束通話後，吳市長復與我國駐英大使鄭天錫通話。之後，電話又接至前曾來滬之英商務團團長鮑埃斯爵士處，吳市長與鮑氏暢談甚歡，詼諧輕鬆語調，博得全塲笑聲。（詳見三月五日本埠各報）繼又由英駐滬總領事吉烈特與我駐倫敦譚總領事通話，末由郁局長與英郵電總局電信司司長通話，全部儀式由是完成。</p>
<p>通話時間地點價目</p>
<p>目前通話地點暫定上海南京與不列顚及北愛爾蘭各地。通話時間暫定上海時間下午五時半至七時半（格林威治標準時間上午九時半至十一時半）星期日停止通話。國際通話計費均以金法郞折合，現一金法郞合國幣四萬九千五百元。中英通話價目訂定最初三分鐘爲三十六金法郞，共合國幣一七四六〇〇〇元，逾時每分鐘爲十二金法郞，合國幣五八二〇〇〇元。銷號費二·四金法郞，合國幣一一大四〇〇元。</p>
<h3>電信常識講話（九）</h3>
<p>— 張家鈺</p>
<p>第三講　怎樣選用特別</p>
<p>業務（續）</p>
<p>（八）親啓　通常我們寄發內容比較重要或富有機密性的信件時，往往在信封上收信人姓名下面加寫「親啓」兩個字；我們所以寫上這兩個字的目的，無非希望交由收信人親自拆閱，但在郵局方面，仍然照常例投送，並不負有必須送交收信人親自收拆的義務，也不另外加收費用。電報裏的「親啓」特別業務和郵信略有不同，凡發報人在電首註明「親啓」或＝MP＝納費標識的電報，收報局在投送時，應在電封上寫明「親啓」或“Personal　Delivery”字樣，並可囑投送這封電報的報差儘可能送達收報人本人手中，最低限度也得在回單上蓋上與收報人姓名相同的圖章（或簽字）纔把電報交付。「親啓」特別業務除在收報人名址前加用一＝MP＝納費標識外，不另收取其他費用。</p>
<p>（九）露封　電局收到各地發來的電報後，爲保持通信機密起見，向例須把電封封好後，纔交報差投送。發報人如欲拍發一極有時間性但內容不必保特機密的電報，可在報首加一「露封」或＝OPEN＝納費標識，收報電局在收到這張電報後，就不加封口投送，這樣，如果電報送到時收報人本人恰巧不在住所，就可以由他的家屬或同居代爲收閱處理，不致因等待收報八回來親自拆閱而躭誤事機。「露封」特別業務除加用一＝OPEN＝納費標識外，不另收取其他費用。</p>
<p>（十）留交　發給沒有固定住址的過路旅客的電報，如經收發報人簡事前約定，可把電報發交當地電局或郵局留待收報人自己前往領取，「留交」特別業務根據三種不同的處理方法，分爲「電留」（標識＝TR＝），「郵留」（標識＝GP＝），和「掛留」（標識＝GPR＝），收報電局對於採用「留交」特別業務的電報的處理方法如下：</p>
<p>「電留」把電報啓回在收報電局營業處，聽候收報人或其代表來局領取，如經四十二天仍未領去，就把原電銷毀。</p>
<p>「郵留」「掛留」收報電局分別把前老用平信後者用掛號信寄至當地郵局收存，聽候收報人或共代表向郵局領取，存留期限照郵局定章辦理。</p>
<p>採用「留交」特別業務的電報，除加用上面規定的納費標識外，「郵留」應按照郵局定章加收平信郵資，「掛留」加收掛號信郵資，「電留」不另計費。</p>
<p>（十）（一）話傳　發給在當地裝有電話的收報人的電報，可以用電話號數代替收報人的住址，例如筆者辦公室裏的電話號數是一一一三〇號，那末，各地發給筆者的電報，也可以寫成「TELEPHONe　11130上海＝張家鈺」，上海電局在收到這張電報之後，先從電話簿裏査出「一一一三〇」號電話用戶的地址，然後按址投送。但如果發報人希望這張電報到達上海後，先由電局把電文的內容用電話傳達給收報人，事後再把電報交報差投送的話，祗要在上開電話號數和收報人姓名前面，加寫一＝TF＝（話傳）標識，電局就可照辦。</p>
<p>除開上面所舉十一種特別業務以外，還有一種「郵遞」特別業務，但並不適用於國內電報，這裏不再冬談。（第三講完）</p>
<h3>懸賞檢舉秘密電台</h3>
<p>— 庸</p>
<p>我們最近又在報端看到軍警機關破獲私營電台的消息，電信局方面確實費過腦筋，三令五申地表示這種私營電台的組織，是破壞國家交通事業，違反交通電信條例的舉動，應受國法嚴厲的制裁，但這些漠視政府法令，不顧商業道德的人，還是偸偸地在幹，這是非常遺憾的。</p>
<p>電信局爲了取締這種專拍商電的私營電合，特地撥出了一筆獎金，來酬答破獲電台的軍警機關或從事吿密的個人或團體，至於告密人的姓名住址，電信局保證嚴守秘密。</p>
<p>應謝過去本市軍警機關的通力合作，使電信當局對這項工作能順利進行，無疑地，今後還要繼續努力，澈底取締這種違法的私營電台，而各界民衆的能合作，就是這項工作成功的主要因素。</p>
<h3>答覆漕涇一市民</h3>
<p>承檢舉漕河涇第六七號公用電話承辦人隆順米號有浮收話費每次一萬五千元等情事，無任公感！當經派員澈査屬實，並發現第六九號公用電話承辦人生源米花廠亦有同樣情事，照章分別嚴予警吿，並輪流罰停通話五天，（六七號自三月十六日至二十日，六九號自三月十一日至十五日）以懲傚尤。如再有浮收，當予拆機處分。至函開該承辦人聲言浮收原因，有涉本局接綫生及外勤機匠索取月規，經詢各該承辦人堅決否認，或係聽聞之誤，並非事實。諸承協助，至綏公誼，嗣後仍希惠賜意見，以便改進爲荷！</p>

<h3>Participatory Government Committee Requests the Government to Stabilize Grain Prices to Maintain People's Food Supply; Urges the Soviet Union to Expedite the Return of Lushun and Dalian</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 13th] The Standing Committee of the Participatory Government held a routine meeting at 9:00 AM on the 13th, chaired by Mo Dehui. After the Secretariat's report, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs submitted a written report, roughly divided into three points: A, Responding to Outer Mongolia's recent protests. B, Recognizing the new government of Siam. C, Establishing a temporary passport issuing agency in Xiamen to facilitate the return of overseas Chinese to their original residences. Subsequently, Xue Dupi, Minister of Water Resources, reported on the recent administrative measures for water conservancy for about an hour. The report was divided into four parts: A, Treatment of the Yellow River. B, Construction of farmland water conservancy and irrigation projects. C, Strengthening basic work. D, Water Law. Then Xue Mingjian, Wu Chunwu, and others raised questions. After Mr. Xue answered, Zhang Binci and Tian Yushi from the Northeast Petition Delegation reported on the situation in the Northeast and the results of their petition. Regarding the current situation in the Northeast, Zhang and others believed that the factors leading to the critical situation lay in the failure of several stages of takeover in the past; such as the initial diplomatic takeover, which resulted in the Northeast's resources being plundered by the Soviet Union. Subsequently, the political takeover also failed. Currently, the military takeover is also failing, because the strategy adopted is to defend strongholds to the death, thus "only knowing how to defend the city, but not clearing the fields," and being defeated by bandits one by one, resulting in the current situation. Therefore, in the future, the greatest determination and the greatest military force must be used to reverse this critical situation. Tian Yushi also proposed that the decision-making regarding the current situation in the Northeast should focus on "seizing time and grasping space." He said that after the petition delegation arrived in Nanjing, the petitions to the Chairman and relevant ministries and commissions regarding the Northeast issue had yielded good results, but it was still hoped that the Participatory Government could continue to supervise and urge the government to implement the promises made to the delegation as soon as possible. After the report, Jiang Yong, Mo Dehui, and others stood up to speak, expressing the Participatory Government's concern for the Northeast issue. Finally, the following proposals were discussed: (1) To stabilize grain prices to maintain the people's food supply and ensure public security, it was resolved to pass it and send it to the government for adoption and implementation. (2) To request the government to urge the Soviet Union to expedite the return of Lushun and Dalian, and if necessary, to appeal to the United Nations, it was resolved to pass it and send it to the government for prompt action. (3) To request exemption from advance payment of income tax to alleviate the industrial and commercial crisis, it was resolved to submit it for review. (4) To step up the absorption of overseas Chinese capital to improve the economic crisis, it was resolved to submit it for review. The meeting adjourned at about 1:00 PM.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 13th] Wang Huayi, a representative of the Northeast Petition Delegation and a current member of the Standing Committee of the Participatory Government, proposed a proposal on strengthening diplomacy with the Soviet Union at the Standing Committee meeting on the 13th. The proposal stated: "Please request the government to urge the Soviet Union to expedite the return of Lushun and Dalian, and if necessary, appeal to the United Nations." After heated discussions, it was resolved to send it to the government for prompt action. The reason for submitting the proposal was still to accuse the Soviet Union of failing to fulfill the Sino-Soviet Friendship Treaty. In order to maintain our country's sovereignty and international peace, we should immediately submit a request to the United Nations General Assembly to demand that the Soviet Union immediately return Lushun and Dalian to our country, compensate our country for the lost materials, and stop supporting the Chinese Communist Party. The cosigners of the proposal also included Pan Chaoying, Wu Chunwu, Wang Junying, and Li Qia. In addition, Wang Huayi's proposal "Please request the government to quickly strengthen the Northeast Defense War," which was submitted to the National Government during the last meeting of the Standing Committee, has been sent to the Executive Yuan and the Ministry of National Defense for prompt review and handling.</p>
<h3>The Participatory Government will Conclude at the End of the Month; A Solemn and Simple Tea Party will be Held on the 28th; Chairman Chiang is Urged to Attend and Give Instructions</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 13th] The National Participatory Government will announce its conclusion before the convocation of the Constitutional National Assembly (i.e., the 28th of this month). The Participatory Government decided to hold a solemn but simple tea party on the day of the conclusion of the meeting, and planned to urge Chairman Chiang to attend and give instructions, and also invite the heads of various ministries and commissions to attend. Members of the Participatory Government, regardless of their term, can participate, in order to conclude this public opinion institution that began at the beginning of the War of Resistance Against Japan and has lasted for ten years. This is indeed an important page in our political history, so this tea party will be a gathering of great significance. It is also learned that the Participatory Government will hold another meeting of the Standing Committee on the 26th before the conclusion. At the Standing Committee meeting on the 13th, several members of the Participatory Government agreed that in view of the current critical situation, in order to understand the actual political, economic, and military situation, Premier Zhang should be invited to attend and report. It was decided that Secretary-General Shao Lizi and Deputy Secretary-General Lei Zhen would urge him to attend. However, Mr. Zhang has recently been unwell, and if he cannot attend, the meeting may be suspended.</p>
<h3>Xue Dupi Answers Questions at the Participatory Government Meeting</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Water Resources Did Not Receive a Report from Feng Yuxiang</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 13th] At the Standing Committee meeting, Participatory Government member Wu Chunwu asked Minister of Water Resources Xue Dupi: "Feng Yuxiang went abroad, reportedly in the name of inspecting water conservancy. I don't know if the Ministry of Water Resources has received a report from Mr. Feng. It is rumored that Mr. Feng used a certain amount of foreign exchange. Does the Ministry of Water Resources know anything about it?" Mr. Xue replied: "Mr. Feng went abroad under the direct appointment of Chairman Chiang of the National Government, not dispatched by the Ministry of Water Resources. I have heard that there is a report, but because it was not dispatched by the Ministry of Water Resources, even if there is a report, it should be directly reported to the Chairman."</p>
<h3>Representatives of Kowloon Walled City Released from Prison Yesterday</h3>
<p>Report to Special Commissioner Guo</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Hong Kong, 13th] A long line of residents of Kowloon Walled City formed in front of the prison at noon today to welcome Zhu Peitang and Liu Yifu, two representatives who had just been released from Stanley Prison after being imprisoned for three months. It is reported that they were punished for resisting the Hong Kong police when the Kowloon Walled City shantytowns were demolished on January 5. Zhu and Liu were pale, and it was obvious that they were malnourished. When they were released from prison, they told those who welcomed them that they had been forced to work eight hours a day during their imprisonment. This afternoon, they also met with Guo Dehua, Special Commissioner of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Guangdong and Guangxi, and reported to him the situation after they were sentenced to imprisonment.</p>
<h3>Northeast Petition Delegation Leaves Nanjing for Shanghai Today</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 13th] The Northeast Petition Delegation attended the Standing Committee meeting of the Participatory Government on the morning of the 13th to report on the situation in the Northeast and the petition process. In the afternoon, a press conference was held to report the details. In the evening, the Korean delegation hosted a banquet and reported to each other.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 13th] The four representatives of the Northeast People's Petition Delegation are scheduled to leave Nanjing for Shanghai on the 14th and wait for a flight back north.</p>
<h3>The Fourth Batch of American Relief Rice will Arrive in Shanghai Successively</h3>
<p>[United States Information Service, Shanghai] The China Relief Mission announced today that another batch of relief rice supplied to China under the American Relief Plan, carried by the "China Victory" ship, is scheduled to depart from San Francisco on the 13th and is expected to arrive in Shanghai on April 2, totaling 1,098 long tons. This is the fourth batch of American relief rice shipped this month. The previous three batches were the "President Jefferson," carrying 415 long tons of rice, scheduled to arrive in Shanghai on March 22, the "Luxembourg Victory," carrying 2,174 tons of rice, scheduled to arrive in Shanghai on March 26, and the "Clovis Victory," carrying 3,000 tons of rice, scheduled to arrive on March 30.</p>
<p>[Another Message] Officials of the China Relief Mission in Shanghai announced that the Chinese translation of "American Aid," "美援" (Měi Yuán), has been used by the China Relief Mission of the U.S. Department of State as a slogan to explain the source and purpose of the US$45 million relief fund for China in the American foreign relief program. Officials of the China Relief Mission explained: "The American foreign relief program is often confused with the institutions that undertake the work after the end of the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA), the Relief Undertaking Custody Committee, various agencies of the United Nations, and many private relief agencies working in China. Although we are assisting in completing some unfinished projects of UNRRA and extracting funds from the proceeds of the sale of American surplus materials as economic assistance to some volunteer relief agencies in China, we hope that all Chinese people can understand that the current US$45 million relief program is purely donated by the United States to help China overcome its current difficulties." The official continued: "A slogan with the words "美援" (Měi Yuán) printed under the American flag will soon be posted in rice stores in Shanghai and other cities where American relief rice is distributed. In the future, each batch of grain, seeds, pesticides, and medical supplies will be marked with these two simple Chinese characters."</p>
<h3>Taft Discusses Aid to China</h3>
<p>Hopes for Passage of the Bill in Early April</p>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 12th] Republican Senator Taft stated during a Senate debate on the aid program on the 12th: "The basis of my foreign policy is to support democratic governments that feel threatened. I believe that such support should be given to China and any other necessary places, regardless of whether the support is of a military nature."</p>
<p>[Another Message] Taft stated on the 12th that he hoped that the aid bills for China, Greece, and Turkey could be passed on April 3. One week later, a joint conference of the two houses could reach a consensus on the bills passed by the two houses and produce the final aid bill.</p>

<h3>Communist Bandits in the Pingbao Section Move Northward</h3>
<p>There is a Trend of Intrusion into the Ping绥 Line</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Baoding, 13th] The Communist bandit army in the Pingbao section is moving northward. The columns of Nie Rongzhen's troops are being transferred north along different routes across Baoyuan. Official intelligence: Most of the Communist bandits have gathered in the triangular mountain area of Taihang Mountain, Yixian, and Laiyuan, and are carrying three months' worth of food coupons. There is a trend of intrusion into the Ping绥 line. They are also clamoring to attack Datong. Some remnants remain in Hebei Province, plotting to disturb the Pingbao line to echo the Communist bandit's actions. Currently, the 7th Column of the Communist bandits is still entrenched outside Baoyuan, confronting the National Army in Baoding.</p>
<h3>Funing County Seat Will be Relocated</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Huaiyin, 13th] Funing County will relocate from its original county seat to Yilin, Donggou in the future, because the city has been ravaged by war and is dilapidated.

<h3>No Development in the Battle of Yimeng</h3>
<p>The Yulin National Army Attacks Shenmu</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Gui绥, 12th] There is no major development in the battle of Yimeng. The two sides are still facing each other near Shenshan. The Sui包 reinforcements have begun to cross the river. The Yulin defending troops are also attacking Shenmu to contain the enemy's rear. In addition, the Communist bandits in Northern Puyu attacked Liangchengchang Hanying without success. They failed to destroy the Ping绥 road in Baoziwan. Among them, 500 cavalry were found in Lingzhen Laoguantian Hongqiziliao, with the appearance of attacking Sui East. The militia groups of Lingzhen, Xinghe, and Huaian counties in Chahar Province, in cooperation with the National Army, completed the encirclement on the 12th.</p>
<h3>Contents of the Sino-Australian Anti-Smuggling Agreement Announced in Guangzhou</h3>
<p>All Goods Entering and Exiting Must Have Certificates</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Guangzhou, 12th] According to Ding Shibin, manager of the Guangzhou Branch of the Central Bank, after the signing of the Sino-Australian (Macau) Agreement, it has been decided that it will be officially announced and take effect by the Central Bank here on the 13th.

<h3>Legislative Yuan Meeting Passes the Sino-Hong Kong Customs Agreement; Decides to Submit Suggestions to the State Council on the Proposal to Authorize the Executive Yuan to Adjust Tax Revenue in a Timely Manner</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 13th] The Legislative Yuan held its 348th meeting on the 13th, chaired by Sun Ke, President of the Yuan. Before the meeting, all members stood up to mourn the late member Ye Qiuyuan. At 9:30 AM, the heads of government began to report on the sources of aid after the victory and its use (contents published on page 2). Premier Zhang was unable to attend due to illness and was replaced by Yu Hongjun, Zheng Jiemin, Ling Hongxun, Zhang Jiaao, Huo Binshu, Wu Zhaohong, Dong Xian and others to report. In the afternoon, a secret meeting was held, and Deputy Minister Zheng Jiemin reported on the use of US aid by the Ministry of National Defense. It is learned that the difference between the US and China in the calculation of leased materials is more than 500 million US dollars. The US calculates based on the price of leased materials, while we estimate based on the price of surplus materials. The leased materials are priced by an agency, while the surplus materials are calculated at 1% to 8% of the original price, so the result is very different. Ambassador Gu is currently inquiring about the difference in the United States. The meeting adjourned at 1:00 PM and continued at 2:30 PM, reviewing and passing (1) the Sino-Hong Kong Customs Agreement, (2) the Regulations on Rewards and Punishments for Local Administrative Leaders in the Riot Suppression Period for Preventing Bandits and Protecting (3) the Territory, and (3) the Exchange Tax Regulations (the text of the regulations is published in column 1 on page 2). In addition, it also amended Article 6 of the Executive Yuan Organization Law, amended Article 30 of the Lawyers Law, and passed the Organization Regulations of the Health Black Fever Prevention and Treatment Office and a total of eight types. The draft of the Public Enterprise Trade Union Law was also submitted for discussion. Because Chen Xiaocen reported that An Futing, chairman of the China Labor Association, had sent a telegram with opinions on the case, it was postponed to the next meeting (scheduled for the 16th) for discussion.</p>
<p>In addition, at today's meeting of the Legislative Yuan, the members believed that the matter was of great importance to the National Government's decision by the State Council to "authorize the Executive Yuan to adjust tax revenue in a timely manner during the period of mobilization and suppression of rebellion to supplement the national treasury revenue, and still directly request the Legislative Yuan to establish a legal procedure within three months" and should first complete the legislative procedure before adjusting tax revenue. It was resolved to hand over the matter to the Finance Committee to formulate suggestions based on this opinion and submit them to the State Council.</p>

<h3>Surplus Materials in China</h3>
<p>U.S. Senate Investigation Report</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 12th] The U.S. Senate High Investigation Committee was ordered on the 12th to investigate the report that the U.S. Senate Investigation Report on the handling of surplus materials in China was guilty of serious violations of the law. Senator Tobey of New Hampshire, Chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, said that he had handed over all of his documents to this newly established committee, which is chaired by Republican Senator Ferguson. The documents were submitted during the Senate Banking Committee's review of McCabe's appointment as Director of the Federal Reserve. The attack on the handling of surplus materials was led by former Brigadier General Thorson (now a Colonel), who was an assistant to McCabe, Chairman of the Foreign Liquidation Committee. Thorson has been ordered by his superiors to return home from Tokyo. Tobey said that all future questions about McCabe will be limited to matters within his banking qualifications. McCabe is a paper manufacturer from Pennsylvania and was recently appointed Director of the Federal Reserve by Truman. His appointment must be approved by the Senate, and the Banking Committee will resume hearing opinions next week.</p>
<h3>Measures for the Circulation and Exchange of Northeast Circulation Coupons; Formulated and Implemented by the Ministry of Finance Today</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 13th] A spokesman for the Ministry of Finance said: "The Northeast was originally a surplus area. At the beginning of the recovery, local prices, interest rates, and wages were lower than those in the customs area. In order to stabilize the local economy and protect the welfare of the people in the Northeast, the government issued Northeast Circulation Coupons to meet local needs. After the circulation of the coupons, most of the prices in the Northeast were lower than those in the customs area, and production industries gradually recovered. The circulation coupons not only maintained the regular official exchange rate, but sometimes the market price actually exceeded the official exchange rate, and the economic situation was gradually developing. However, since the Communist bandits invaded, transportation and production industries in the Northeast have been repeatedly destroyed, and prices have soared, which was not expected. Now, in order to maintain currency confidence and stabilize the economy of the Northeast, and at the same time take into account the economic and financial situation within the customs, the government has made appropriate changes to the original measures and formulated measures for the circulation and exchange of Northeast Circulation Coupons, which will be implemented today to improve the credit of Northeast Circulation Coupons and enhance the strength of suppressing the rebellion. The measures are as follows: (1) The area of circulation of Northeast Circulation Coupons is still limited to the nine provinces of the Northeast; (2) The exchange rate between Northeast Circulation Coupons and Legal Tender is set at one yuan of Circulation Coupons for ten yuan of Legal Tender; (3) From the date of promulgation of these measures, Legal Tender is allowed to be used in the nine provinces of the Northeast and exchanged with Circulation Coupons according to the exchange rate; (4) Passengers entering the customs carrying Northeast Circulation Coupons are allowed to exchange Legal Tender for Circulation Coupons at the Central Bank in Shanhaiguan and Beiping. In Shanhaiguan, they should exchange based on their train tickets, and in Beiping, they should exchange based on a copy of their plane tickets. The amount of exchange per person will be formulated by the Central Bank based on the situation and submitted to the Ministry of Finance for approval; (5) Remittances from the Northeast to the customs area should be appropriately relaxed. The examination and approval measures will be formulated by the Central Bank with reference to current laws and regulations and reported to the Ministry of Finance for approval; (6) These measures will be implemented from the date of promulgation."</p>
<h3>Land Forces Xuzhou Headquarters Chief of Staff Analyzes the Jiangsu-Shandong Battle Situation and Points Out the Bandit Army's Good Strategies</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from our Xuzhou Bureau on the 12th] Guo Rugui, Chief of Staff of the Xuzhou Headquarters of the Land Forces, met with reporters on the 12th to analyze the recent battle situation in the Jiangsu-Shandong border area. He believes that the aim of the bandit army's harassment in various parts of northern Jiangsu is to create unease in the hearts of the people in Nanjing and Shanghai during the National Assembly. The original main force of the bandit army was the 11th and 12th columns of Chen Yi's troops. Currently, their 2nd column has arrived from Shandong to reinforce them. The 7th column may have a small part participating, but with their current strength, they will definitely not be able to achieve anything. In the Jiaodong area, fierce fighting is taking place in Zhoucun. The real purpose of the bandit army's attack may be to cover their main force crossing the Yellow River northward in order to escape being trapped by the National Army. In the Yellow River flooded area of western Shandong, there are the main forces of the 1st, 4th, and 6th columns of the bandit army. However, after being severely attacked by the National Army, their strength has been greatly weakened and has not yet been fully replenished. In addition, the 3rd and 8th detachments under Chen Yi have been transferred to Xuchang and are under the command of Chen Geng. They are currently joining forces with the Guang and Kong Congzhou bandit troops to invade Luoyang. In total, Chen Yi's troops have 13 detachments, approximately 140,000 men, possessing machine guns and other weapons. Their firepower is only comparable to that of the second-tier National Army. When fighting head-on, they are no match for the National Army's 13 elite divisions. However, their advantage lies in their quick movement and their skill in setting ambushes. The National Army's defeats were all due to marching in obstacle zones and being ambushed by the bandit troops, such as in Biancang in northern Jiangsu, where the bandit army ambushed them seven times in the same location. As for the bandit army's losses, they are the greatest when attacking fortified positions. The Battle of Namma in central and southern Shandong in the 36th year of the Republic [1947] can prove this, because the bandit army's preparations and tactics are both outdated. The bandit army's claims of "approaching the balance of power" are all self-deception, at least within the Guannei [area within the passes, i.e. mainland China]. Outside the Guannei, there are other factors involved. When discussing the strategy for suppressing the rebellion, he said: The bandit army moves quickly, making it difficult to capture its main force. The correct strategy is to chase them out of their base areas and force them into a dead end to annihilate them. In the continuous pursuit, their officers can be demoralized and their soldiers will desert. The small battles in Teng County and other places in central Shandong in the 36th year of the Republic [1947] yielded this result. When the bandit army's 1st and 4th detachments were forced into a dead end in the Yellow River delta area, nearly 10,000 bandits were annihilated and many surrendered. One unit of bandits was chased so urgently that they lost their minds and even took the Jinpu Railway south to northern Jiangsu, where they were captured alive by the National Army. As for clearing out the remnant bandits in the Sui District, it is necessary to establish local armed forces. However, how to establish them still depends on the effective implementation of central government policies.</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Central News Agency, Xuzhou, 13th] "Expelling them from important places, forcing them into desperate situations, and putting them in mortal danger are good strategies for suppressing the communist bandits at present." This was stated by Guo Rugui, Chief of Staff of the Xuzhou Headquarters of the Land Forces, when he met with the reporter delegation from Nanjing and Shanghai. Guo believes that this method of suppressing bandits will cause the communist bandits to either be beaten to death or run to death, or starve to death if they cannot run. Guo also predicted that the final outcome of suppressing the bandits will not be the complete annihilation of the communist bandits, but the complete defeat of the communist bandits. As long as the National Army pursues them closely, the communist bandits will have to run quickly. Guo, in his capacity as a government staff member representing the government at the three-man meetings during the Kuomintang-Communist negotiations the year before last, Marshal Marshall once said: The Chinese Communist Party has several hundred thousand cadres who are willing to sacrifice themselves as a main force, and they cannot be insulted. Over the past three years, these communist cadres have disappeared in the life of fleeing under the continuous pursuit of the National Army, and have been replaced by ignorant people who are coerced. Marshal Marshall's estimate of the communist cadres who were willing to sacrifice themselves for communism can only be calculated at 20-30% today. However, the Chinese Communist Party lacks military talent, and cunning people easily obtain opportunities for development. For example, according to the military agreement signed by the three parties at the time, the Chinese Communist Party should produce two general commanders of army groups. The Chinese Communist Party proposed Peng Dehuai and Chen Yi. I (Guo himself) then asked Zhou Enlai: It is reasonable for Peng Dehuai to be the general commander of the army group, but why only mention Chen Yi and not Lin Biao or Liu Bocheng for the other general commander of the army group? Zhou replied: Chen Yi's influence has developed more deeply and he deserves it without any doubt. From this, it can be seen that the Chinese Communist Party only knows how to worship power. Guo then gave a general analysis of Chen Yi's troop strength after the Namma Battle. Chen Yi's current troop strength is claimed to be 13 columns, approximately 150,000 men, with the western Shandong corridor as the base for disrupting the Central Plains. Northern Jiangsu, Jiaodong, and northern Anhui are regarded as supporting battlefields. Chen Yi has exposed two weaknesses since his disastrous defeat in the Namma Battle: First, Chen Yi's so-called counter-offensive is only a reverse without an offensive, and he has no ability to attack fortified positions; second, Chen Yi's specialty of ambushes cannot resist the strong National Army. Chen Yi occasionally boasts that he has reached the stage of comparing strength with the National Army with a small victory, which is self-deception. Guo finally believes that in order to defeat the mass line of the communist bandits, it is necessary to first establish local armed forces and eliminate the communist bandits' village cadres. However, local armed forces should not be controlled by local tyrants and evil gentry, but should be controlled by local heroes who defend their homes and villages.</p>
<h3>Due to Strategic Considerations, the National Army in Northeast China Withdraws from Yongji and Xiaofengman; The Column of Accompanying Civilians Stretches Over Ten Miles</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Central News Agency, Changchun, 13th] When the National Army withdrew from Jilin, the column of accompanying civilians stretched over fifty miles. The wide and snowy Jichang Highway was filled with these "people who do not want to be slaves." According to eyewitness estimates, the total number was no less than 100,000, almost half of the population of Jilin City. They were intercepted by the bandit army several times during the march, and more than 20,000 people were separated from the National Army's covering troops due to their late departure, resulting in them being blocked by bandit cavalry. In the past two days, more than 50,000 Jilin refugees who have been regarded as righteous people have entered the Changchun urban area one after another. The municipal government has set up multiple reception centers to properly comfort and accommodate them. Because Qingdao and Changchun are close to each other, most of the righteous people have relatives and friends to rely on. According to investigations and statistics by the authorities, as of noon today, the number of orphaned and helpless people who rely solely on relief for survival has not exceeded 300.</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Central News Agency, Changchun, 11th] Due to strategic considerations, the National Army has now voluntarily withdrawn from Yongji, the location of the Jilin provincial government, and Xiaofengman, the electric capital. Personnel and family members from various agencies and bureaus of the Qing Province provincial government have also withdrawn with the army. The National Army began its actions at 2:00 AM on the 9th and had completely reached its designated area by the 11th. Although it encountered bandit attacks several times along the way, it quickly overcame them. When the National Army began to withdraw, although it was late at night, thousands of citizens immersed in sleep were quickly awakened by the extraordinary barking of dogs. After realizing the National Army's intentions, they immediately supported the old and carried the young, and automatically joined the National Army's column, requesting to go together. Within a few hours, hundreds of thousands of people gathered, and the National Army provided proper cover to safely evacuate them from the dangerous situation. However, they were repeatedly attacked by the bandit forces along the way, and civilians suffered slight casualties, and some were scattered. Furthermore, when the National Army withdrew from Xiaofengman, in order to take into account the safety of the lives and property of tens of thousands of people along the Songhua River and the difficulty of national production and construction, it only slightly dismantled the machinery of the power plant so that the bandit forces could not utilize it in the short term. However, the Songhua River dam, which was built over several years with the hard work of hundreds of thousands of people, was preserved and not destroyed in the slightest. At the same time, the ammunition piled up in warehouses and civilian houses near Yongqing Railway Station was not destroyed because such destruction would inevitably cause a huge explosion and turn the entire city of Yongji into ashes.</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch from our Beiping Bureau on the 13th] Zheng Dongguo, Deputy Director of the Northeast Headquarters, has recently been appointed as Deputy Commander-in-Chief of Bandit Suppression in the Northeast and Commander of the First Army Corps, stationed in Changchun. The matter of Zheng concurrently serving as the Chairman of Jilin Province is still under discussion. It is said that Zheng will take office after going to Changchun again. Furthermore, a certain unit of the National Army has arrived safely in Changchun from Qinglin. Zheng, along with Army Commander Zeng Zesheng, inspected the garrison locations and extended his condolences.</p>
<p>The Defenders of Siping Complete Their Mission</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch from our Luoyang Bureau on the 13th] The National Army in Siping fought hard for ten days and accomplished the mission of annihilating the bandits. The bandits suffered more than 10,000 casualties, and the National Army also suffered heavy casualties. On the 12th, the bandits broke in from both the northeast and engaged in a melee. The defending troops telegraphed that the bandit artillery fire was fierce and requested air force assistance at night. As of the 13th, the fighting was still ongoing. It has been found that large numbers of Japanese prisoners of war and Korean bandits participated in both defensive battles of Siping. The bandit artillery fire was fierce, and they attacked with small tanks.</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Central News Agency, Shenyang, 13th] Fierce street fighting has broken out in Siping, the granary of Liaobei. At noon on the 13th, under the cover of tanks, the bandits fiercely attacked the city. A large number of Japanese prisoners of war and Korean communists were found among the bandits, and they engaged in fierce fighting with the defending troops, especially in the eastern suburbs of the city. Later, a unit of bandits broke through our defenses and invaded the eastern part of the city. Both sides then engaged in a heroic street fight. Our defending troops firmly defended their core strongholds and fought bravely. At night, the bandits continued to attack the city from the northern suburbs. They were attacked by our ground and air forces, and the fighting is still ongoing.</p>

<h3>The Lesson of Czechoslovakia</h3>
<p>— Cheng Tianfang</p>
<p>The coup in Czechoslovakia on February 25th and the suicide of Czech Foreign Minister Jan Masaryk on March 9th should provide a profound lesson for the Chinese people and people all over the world!</p>
<p>Czechoslovakia was an independent country that emerged from World War I. Its area is only more than 49,300 square miles, and its population is 14,720,000 (statistics from 1934), which is really just a small country. However, it is highly regarded among the countries of the world, not only because it occupies a strategically important position in European geography, but also because it is one of the most enlightened and progressive countries in Eastern Europe. Among the countries of Eastern Europe, only Czechoslovakia can be said to have truly implemented democratic politics, and its constitutional achievements are no less than those of the Netherlands and Belgium. Czechoslovakia's education, transportation, and economy are very developed, and therefore, the knowledge and living standards of the Czech people are higher than those of any other country in Eastern Europe. The capital, Prague, has a very famous university. Czech agriculture and industry are evenly developed, with the number of people engaged in industry and agriculture accounting for 35% of the total population. Czechoslovakia's area is smaller than that of Anhui Province, yet before the war, it had 15,500 kilometers of railway (80% of which was state-owned), 69,700 kilometers of highway, and 125,000 automobiles. Czechoslovakia's sugar, beer, smoked meat, leather shoes, and glassware are famous throughout the world. Coal and iron are quite abundant. In 1937, it produced 1.67 million tons of iron and 2.31 million tons of steel, most of which was exported. Timber, leather, cotton textiles, wool textiles, and hemp textiles are also sold in large quantities abroad. In 1927, Czechoslovakia's total import value was 10.981 billion crowns (equivalent to more than US$332 million), and its total export value was 11.982 billion crowns (equivalent to more than US$363 million). The government's finances were also very balanced and sound, with a surplus every year and no deficit in the budget. In 1937, the revenue was 8.456 billion crowns and the expenditure was 8.454 billion crowns (both equivalent to more than US$256 million).</p>
<p>Czechoslovakia was not only rich but also strong militarily. Since its founding, the government has attached great importance to national defense. In 1918, the Czechoslovak Republic was established, and the following year, it hired French military advisers to train the army and adopted a conscription system, requiring 20-year-old men to serve in the military. The military advisory group served for ten years, greatly improving the efficiency of the Czech military and making the Czech army one of the best-trained and equipped forces in Europe. Czechoslovakia's arms industry is very famous in the world, and the products of the Skoda factory are no less than those of the German Krupp factory. The machine guns and rifles used by our country in the early days of the War of Resistance were manufactured by the Skoda factory.</p>
<p>A country like Czechoslovakia can be considered to have achieved remarkable achievements in both civil administration and military preparedness. Everything was thriving. In 1936 and 1938, I visited the Czech capital twice and visited the Skoda factory and Carlsbad hot springs. I personally saw the neatness and cleanliness of its cities and villages, the grandeur of its public buildings, the industriousness and intelligence of its people, and the progress and excellence of its craftsmanship, all of which were comparable to Western Europe without any inferiority. Czech society was full of a spirit of vigor and progress, and there was absolutely no phenomenon of corruption and degeneration. However, this country, because it is located between the two great powers of the Soviet Union and Germany, and because it had internal traitors, has suffered external aggression and has twice suffered a tragic fate in the last ten years. The first time was in 1938 and 1939 when it was annexed by Germany, and the second time was this coup.</p>
<p>Czechoslovakia's ability to build a nation was largely due to Thomas G. Masarik (the father of the foreign minister who committed suicide). This founding hero was one of the great statesmen of the 20th century. Because of his extensive knowledge, great personality, and lifelong struggle for freedom, democracy, and the liberation of the Czech nation, he gained the sympathy of the governments of the United States, Britain, and France. Therefore, in October 1918, when Germany was about to fail, the Czechoslovak Republic was formally born and immediately recognized by the great powers. Thomas Masarik was elected as the first president, and only resigned at the end of 1935 due to old age (he was 86 years old at the time). Eduard Benesh (the current president) succeeded him.</p>
<p>Masarik served for a full 17 years, laying the foundation for democracy and prosperity in Czechoslovakia, and at the same time, he made every effort to ensure the country's security in diplomacy. At that time, Czechoslovakia was most afraid of Germany's resurgence, which would become a threat to Czechoslovakia again. Therefore, it signed an alliance with France and formed the Little Entente with Romania and Yugoslavia. After Hitler came to power, it signed a defensive alliance with the Soviet Union in 1935. In the eyes of the Czechs, with the two great powers of France and the Soviet Union as allies, they should be as stable as a rock. But no one knew that things in the world often turn out unexpectedly. The 3.3 million Germans in the Czech population were scattered in the Sudetenland bordering Germany and Austria. After Germany became strong, it used these Sudeten Germans to create disputes within Czechoslovakia, disrupt order, and demand separation from Czechoslovakia. Hitler further used the pretext of protecting the Germans to occupy the Sudetenland. The situation became tense in 1938. The Soviet Union stood by, while France and Britain adopted a policy of compromise toward Germany. The Munich Conference recognized Hitler's demands and ceded the Sudetenland to Germany. In addition, it ceded a large piece of land to Hungary and a small piece of land to Poland. Czechoslovakia lost 30% of its land and one-third of its population in total. Since its two allies had abandoned Czechoslovakia, Czechoslovakia had no choice but to painfully accept these conditions, and Benesh resigned as a result. In March 1939, Hitler tore up the Munich Agreement and occupied the entire territory of Czechoslovakia. Czechoslovakia was completely destroyed!</p>
<p>Czechoslovakia was under German occupation for more than six years. In February 1945, the German army retreated, and Czechoslovakia celebrated its rebirth, and Benesh resumed his presidency. The Czech government has always pursued a policy of good neighborliness, especially with the Soviet Union, the elder brother of the Slavic nations, and has strived for friendship. It had already concluded a defensive alliance before the war. This time, the liberation depended on the military strength of the Soviet Union, so it naturally spared no expense to seek the favor of the Soviet Union. The Soviet Union demanded the cession of the Ruthenia region, and the Czech government immediately agreed. It also signed treaties of mutual assistance and economic treaties with the Soviet Union, incorporating Czechoslovakia into the Soviet sphere of influence. In July 1946, the cabinet was reorganized, and Benesh appointed Klement Gottwald, a member of the Communist Party, as prime minister. The Communist Party held nine of the 26 cabinet seats. It was nominally a five-party coalition cabinet, but in reality, the Communist Party had the greatest power. Benesh believed that this approach would please his powerful neighbor. But no one knew that the ambitions of an invading country have no limits. Although Czechoslovakia made such concessions, the Soviet Union still felt that Czechoslovakia's independence and democratic spirit were too strong compared to Yugoslavia, Romania, and other countries, and it was not enough to be a loyal vassal state. In particular, last August, the Czech government, under the leadership of Benesh, surprisingly announced that it would participate in the Paris Conference responding to the Marshall Plan, which angered the Kremlin even more. So, a long-distance telephone call from Moscow forced Czechoslovakia to announce its cancellation of its decision to participate in the Paris Conference. This act of slapping itself in the face is intolerable for any independent country, but Czechoslovakia actually endured it. But the Kremlin still did not forgive it, so it launched this coup, which made the government's power exclusively held by the Communist Party. From now on, it can naturally completely obey Moscow's orders. So-called independence and so-called democracy have become nominal! No one knows whether Benesh's actions are free now. Jan Masaryk was heartbroken and disappointed, and had no choice but to commit suicide. They, father and son, devoted their lives to the country and the nation, and encountered such an ending, which really makes people all over the world who love freedom and democracy feel infinite sympathy and infinite grief.</p>
<p>We not only grieve for Czechoslovakia, but we also need to reflect on China's situation. The Czech communists colluded with external forces to stage a coup, and the Chinese Communist Party is also colluding with external forces to make war. Some people in the United States (including General Marshall) still believe that the reason why the China problem is so serious and the Chinese people are so suffering is due to the suppression of the communists by military force, and the suppression of the communists by military force occurred because the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference were not implemented, including the failure to form a coalition government that included the Communist Party. As for why the resolutions were not implemented and why the coalition government could not be formed, "both sides" (the government and the Communist Party) were at fault (see Marshall's remarks to reporters on the 10th of this month). On this point, we cannot help but sigh that General Marshall and Americans who hold the same views are too naive! The Communist Party of any country in the world is an extremely exclusive party with the strongest degree of exclusion, and it will never allow the existence of other political parties, let alone cooperate with other political parties to shoulder political responsibility. The reason why the Communist Parties of Eastern Europe, Western Europe, and China emphasized coalition governments after the war was entirely a means or a step for them to seize power. Before the Communist Party's strength was sufficient and its preparations were complete, it used the guise of "democratic politics" to demand that it form a government with other parties. Once it had a foothold in the government, it tore off its "democratic" mask when it believed that the opportunity had arrived, and excluded other parties, slaughtered dissidents, and embarked on the road of dictatorship. Since the summer of 1946, the political unrest that has occurred in Eastern European countries such as Yugoslavia, Hungary, Bulgaria, and Poland has fully demonstrated this principle. The Czech incident has added another strong piece of evidence. Under five consecutive similar incidents, some people still believe that the Chinese Communist Party sincerely wanted to form a coalition government with other political parties in China in the Political Consultative Conference. That is either wishful thinking or self-deception. For the sake of China and the sake of the world, fortunately, the coalition government that included the Chinese Communist Party was not realized at that time, and the Chinese government now has the determination and strength to resist the aggression of the international Communist Party. If there had been such a coalition government two years ago, I am afraid that a coup similar to the one in Czechoslovakia would have occurred in China long ago, and China would have already fallen into the sphere of influence of international communism!</p>
<p>Under the leadership of Moscow, international communism continues to develop in Asia and Europe. This development is organized and planned, with unified orders and orderly steps, just like the battle plan of a large military operation. On the other hand, the countries that love freedom and democracy and oppose communism have divergent ideas, slow actions, scattered forces, and even the attitude of getting by as long as the fire has not reached their eyebrows. Like many people in Britain and the United States, they oppose communism on the one hand, and on the other hand, they believe that the trouble caused by the Chinese Communist Party is China's own problem, and other countries can stand by and do nothing. If this continues, communism can defeat the democratic countries of the world one by one and achieve its ambition of dominating the world. The ancients said: "It is not too late to mend the fold after the sheep are lost." Czechoslovakia is gone. If the people of the democratic countries of the world do not want their own countries to become the second Czechoslovakia, then they must quickly wake up, quickly unite and fight to resist the offensive of communism in order to save the world from disaster; otherwise, they will regret it one day.</p>

<h3>Yu Hongjun Reports to the Legislative Yuan on Various US Loans and Their Uses</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency Nanjing, 13th] Finance Minister Yu Hongjun reported to the Legislative Yuan on the 13th on the various US loans to China after the victory and their uses. The contents are as follows:</p>
<p>The US loans to China after the victory can be divided into four categories according to their nature and source:</p>
<p>A. Post-war loans for materials. According to the procurement plans of various agencies, the Pre-War US Materials Supply Committee negotiated with the US side. These loans are all credit loans, and the government repays the principal and interest on a regular basis in accordance with the agreement. Zi. US Export-Import Bank Loans: (1) US$33 million for cotton loans, of which US$32.976 million has been used by the end of this month; (2) US$16.65 million for railway loans, of which US$15.2 million has been received by January this year; (3) US$8.8 million for power plant loans, of which US$3.9 million has been used by the end of this month; (4) US$2.6 million for ship purchase loans, for the purchase of 16 ships, of which US$2.45 million has been used; (5) US$1.5 million for coal mining equipment loans, of which US$825,000 has been used; (6) US$16 million for Yongli Chemical Company loans, guaranteed by the government; (7) US$42 million for ship loans, not yet used due to the difficulty of purchasing ships. The total of the above seven loans is US$82.75 million. Except for items 6 and 7, the government can use US$62.55 million. Chou. US Government Loans: (1) US$58.5 million in loans for materials borrowed under the Lend-Lease Act, of which US$50.17 million has been used by the end of last year; (2) US$16.5 million in loans from the Shipping Administration Bureau for the purchase of ships, of which US$6.94 million has been used. The total amount of post-war loan materials is US$149.442 million.</p>
<p>B. Most of the post-war Lend-Lease materials are for military use and are directly handled by the Ministry of National Defense. The US State Department's bill sent by our Ambassador to the United States, Gu, lists a total of US$747.28 million, including (1) US$111.742 million for military fire; (2) US$35.62 million for aircraft; (3) US$99.99 million for tanks; (4) US$32.8 million for ships; (5) US$55.81 million for military equipment; (6) US$36,000 for production equipment; (7) US$37 million for agricultural and industrial equipment; (8) US$353.82 million for labor services, totaling US$747.28 million. However, according to the report of the Ministry of National Defense, the post-war Lend-Lease materials should be US$810.113 million based on the calculation of the original inventory at the time of receipt. In addition, the Navy received more than US$24.38 million, totaling more than US$105.4 million, with a difference of more than US$500 million. The reasons are (1) the list provided by the US side is too simple and cannot be verified by both parties; (2) items without certainty in the list amount to more than US$570 million; (3) labor service costs are difficult to verify; (4) it is not known whether other special material items are also mixed in. I have telegraphed Ambassador Gu to inquire about this type of difference.</p>
<p>C. Surplus materials are in the nature of debt repayment and are handled by the Materials Supply Bureau. There are three items: (1) The Western China Region, signed by former President Song and the US side in November 1945, mainly consists of aviation materials, which were received by the former Aviation Commission. The initial valuation by the US side was US$673.731 million and 5.16 billion in legal tender. At the time of receipt, it was more than US$57.369 million and more than 9.27 billion in legal tender, of which the legal tender item was offset by our advance payment for the US side (construction of rear airports, etc.); (2) The Navy's purchase of the original agreement did not specify the total amount, stipulating that Jiangnan Shipyard would go to various islands in the Pacific to purchase, and Jiangnan Shipyard would repair ships for the US side as compensation; (3) The Pacific Region was signed by former President Song and the US side in August 1946, including US$500 million in mobile materials and US$84 million in fixed equipment in China. The US side also provided US$30 million for transportation costs. Except for the US$74 million in materials that should be paid before signing the agreement, the remaining was offset by the legal tender of US$130 billion advanced by us during the US military's stationing in China. US$55 million is still owed, with US$35 million used for the US side to purchase houses in China, and another US$20 million used as the US Educational Foundation in China. The above materials are all received by the Materials Supply Bureau. By the end of February, more than US$278 million has been received, and US$175 million has been shipped to our country. All materials must be shipped to our country before the end of June. Of these materials, 70% will be allocated to the Ministry of Transportation and the Ministry of National Defense, and 30% will be auctioned off and handed over to the national treasury.</p>
<p>D. Post-disaster relief materials. The Administrative Relief and Rehabilitation Administration received more than US$535 million in relief materials and US$122.25 million in ocean freight, totaling US$647.5 million, of which the US contribution accounted for 72%, totaling more than US$460 million, which was handled by the Administrative Relief and Rehabilitation Administration.</p>

<h3>The Center of Western European Diplomacy Moves to Paris, Sixteen-Nation Conference Opens Tomorrow, The United States and Recipient Countries Discuss the Transportation of Materials</h3>
<p>[French News Agency Paris, 13th] After the adjournment of the Five-Nation Conference, the center of diplomatic activity has shifted from Ruhr to Paris. The Sixteen-Nation Conference will be held here tomorrow. At least fourteen foreign ministers will attend the conference. Observers say that the main task of the conference is to discuss the reconstruction of European countries, but this is also the best opportunity for national politicians to discuss issues outside the agenda. First, opinions on European economic recovery will be taken. This report can be regarded as a "general outline" of various achievements in mutual assistance and cooperation. Then, the reports of the US and European resources and production groups will be reviewed. It is reported that the report from the US side is generally the same as that made by the technical committee last fall. At the same time, a "Standing Committee" will be established, including representatives from the sixteen countries or perhaps one representative from West Germany. This committee is the successor to the European Cooperation Committee last fall, and its task is to establish a permanent institution to implement the Marshall Plan. Opinions differ widely on the powers of this permanent institution. Some parties say that if this institution is only given advisory powers, it will not be able to complete its tasks smoothly. Other countries say that this institution does not need to have the power to allocate goods, as this will infringe on the sovereignty of the countries concerned. However, goodwill and cooperation are "indispensable" in order to achieve satisfactory results. In short, it is undeniable that this decision will have a very significant impact on Europe.</p>
<p>[French News Agency Paris, 12th] Italian Foreign Minister Sforza and Greek Foreign Minister and Deputy Prime Minister Tsaldaris, each leading their respective delegations, will arrive in Paris tomorrow to prepare to attend the Economic Cooperation Conference.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency Washington, 12th] According to a State Department spokesperson today, while Congress has not yet passed the European Recovery Program, representatives of the sixteen countries participating in the program and responsible US officials held informal talks here today to lay the foundation for the European Recovery Program. It is said that the talks are exploratory and aim to determine the types of materials to be imported in order to provide the necessary reports to those who implement the European Recovery Program.</p>
<h3>Talks Between British and Turkish Foreign Ministers Reaffirm Friendship Between the Two Countries; Norway Denies Soviet Request for Treaty Negotiations</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, December 12] Before attending the Sixteen-Nation Conference in Paris, Turkish Foreign Minister Sadak met with British Foreign Secretary Bevin in London today to discuss issues of mutual concern to Britain and Turkey, as well as potential issues arising from the European Recovery Program. A communique issued after the meeting stated that the talks provided an opportunity to further the close friendship between the two countries and governments. Britain and Turkey will continue their past cooperation, based on the 1939 Anglo-Turkish Alliance, to maintain good relations and world peace. The communique also formally reaffirmed the continued validity of the 1939 Anglo-French-Turkish mutual assistance treaty, which was signed after the outbreak of the war and stipulated that if Turkey were to be attacked by a European country and participate in a war in the Mediterranean region, Britain and France would provide assistance to Turkey.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Oslo, December 12] Norwegian Foreign Minister Lange today denied rumors that the Soviet Union had requested negotiations with the Norwegian government to sign a mutual assistance pact.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, December 12] It is widely rumored here that the Soviet government has requested a mutual assistance treaty with Norway, as it had previously suggested to Finland. Authoritative sources believe these rumors are merely hearsay. The opinion of officials here is that the participation of the French and Italian Communist parties in the Cominform is indicative of the Communist movement's direction. Recent actions by Moscow and Belgrade confirm that the Italian general election, which begins on April 18, is a decisive event within the Communist strategy. While no one in London denies the possibility that the Soviet government may suggest a defensive alliance with Norway at some point, Soviet policy in Europe seems to be limited to consolidating the Soviet sphere of influence east of the boundaries established by last year's Sixteen-Nation Marshall Plan Conference in Paris. The British believe that it would be an extremely serious development if the Soviet government attempted to drag European countries, such as Norway, which have already clearly stated their independent stance, into the Soviet sphere of influence. Coinciding with rumors of Soviet pressure on Norway is the alleged special purpose of Norwegian Defense Minister Hauge's visit to London. Hauge returned to Norway via London from Berlin last weekend. Although it is said that Hauge's visit to London was to discuss the future status of the Norwegian occupation forces in the British zone of Germany with the British War Office and to order British jet fighters, sensitive individuals believe that Hauge's visit to Britain also had other missions.</p>

<p>[Reuters, Charleston, South Carolina, December 13] Former Secretary of State Byrnes stated in his hometown of Charleston today that the United States should solemnly warn the Soviet Union that if the independence of Italy, France, Greece, and Turkey is threatened by methods of intimidation, the United States will take action, not merely issue a protest.

The Soviet Union informed the United States, Britain, and France on the 6th of this month that these countries were turning West Germany into a military base in preparation for aggression against the Soviet Union, and the Brussels Conference is a further step in this policy."</p>

<h3>Funeral Held Under Gloomy Skies, Crowds Line the Streets to Pay Respects; State Funeral for Late Czech Foreign Minister Yesterday; Benes Attends Only Preliminary Ceremony</h3>
<p>[United Press, Prague, December 13] The state funeral for the late Foreign Minister Masaryk, organized by the Communist Funeral Committee, was held today under gloomy skies. The hall was set up in the National Museum, and from early morning, countless people gathered in the streets around the museum, the Parliament Building, and the central square. Flower shops sold out of flowers, which were thrown at the gun carriage carrying the hearse as it slowly passed by. Yesterday, from morning to dusk, over 250,000 men and women filed past Masaryk's body to pay their final respects.</p>
<p>[United Press, Prague, December 13] Millions of Czechs gathered in the streets of Prague on the 13th to pay their final respects to Masaryk, with soldiers and police standing guard along the two-mile route of the funeral procession, preventing the crowds from surging forward. Residents along the route had been warned not to open their windows during the procession. Cabinet members, diplomatic missions, and hundreds of thousands of civilians participated in the procession. President Benes, who has remained secluded since the Communist coup, will also leave his rural villa to preside over the funeral. An official announcement stated that the President will attend the preliminary ceremony in the Prague Museum, and Communist Prime Minister Gottwald will represent the President in leading the procession from the museum to the Czernin Palace, the location of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, where a brief ceremony will also be held. The hearse will then proceed to the Masaryk family tomb in Lany, which Benes is not expected to attend. Gottwald delivered a funeral eulogy, stating: "What I least expected has happened. Now that this tragic event has occurred, I, as Prime Minister, must deliver a funeral eulogy and accompany our beloved friend to his final resting place. Masaryk and I recently had a cheerful discussion about the bright future of our domestic and foreign policies. He was as optimistic as ever. We also talked about personal matters, including Masaryk's planned recuperation in the mountains after his speech in Parliament. The news of his death was like a bolt from the blue, a terrible blow to me and his friends."</p>
<h3>Taft Asks Reduction of Aid-to-Europe Funds; U.S. Senate Rejects; Legislation Completed Before April</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, December 13] Republican Senator Taft's proposal to reduce the first year's expenditure of the European Recovery Program to four billion dollars was defeated last night by a vote of 56 to 31. The $5.3 billion aid-to-Europe bill is expected to pass quickly and be put into effect on April 1, but many other amendments remain to be voted on.</p>
<p>The defeat of Taft's amendment appears to be a high point in the opposition to the European Recovery Program. The Senate adjourned late into the night and will continue the meeting on the 13th to make a final vote on the bill.</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, December 13] Republican leaders Senators Taft and Vandenberg publicly disagreed for the first time last night on whether the aid-to-Europe bill should be limited to one year or four years. Vandenberg stated that the bill is intended to last for four years, but that no Congress can bind the next Congress, and that the continuation of aid should be discussed annually, depending on whether the recipient countries can fulfill their obligations. Taft retorted, "I completely disagree. There is no such obligation. There is no contractual relationship between the recipient countries and us."</p>
<h3>Seventy-One British Parliament Members Request Formation of Western European Federation</h3>
<p>[United Press, London, December 13] Seventy-one members of all parties in the British Parliament, except the Communist Party, have jointly proposed a motion calling for immediate action to form a federation between the countries of Western Europe in order to save democracy. This is the first parliamentary attempt in Europe to realize a century-long dream. The British Foreign Office declined to comment on the proposal. The members of Parliament are calling for the establishment of an urgent "revolutionary" long-term policy to organize a Western European economic and political federation. This motion coincides with the conclusion of the Brussels Treaty, but is even more significant than the latter, as it serves as the foundation for Western European unity.</p>

<h3>Czech Incident Included on Provisional Agenda; Security Council to Discuss on Wednesday; Chile Lodges Complaint Against Soviet Union with United Nations</h3>
<p>[United Press, Lake Success, December 12] Chile today requested a United Nations investigation into the Soviet Union's role in the Communist coup in Czechoslovakia. The case has been placed on the provisional agenda for the Security Council on the 17th. After the sudden death of Czech Foreign Minister Masaryk, the country's Permanent Representative to the United Nations, Papanek, requested an investigation, but it was shelved by UN Secretary-General Lie. Today, the Chilean representative, on the orders of Chilean President Videla, formally lodged a complaint. Chile also accused the Soviet Union of using Hitler's tactics. This is the first time since the Iranian incident two years ago that the Soviet Union has been directly accused before the Security Council. The first step in this test case will be to discuss whether to include it on the formal agenda, which is a procedural matter and not subject to the veto power of the five permanent members. The major Western European powers will again confront the Soviet Union's expansion of power in Europe and elsewhere. Some speculate that the Soviet Union will follow its old tactic of March 1946 and withdraw from the meeting when the Security Council discusses the case.</p>

<h3>The British Constitution</h3>
<p>— (By L.S. Amery, translated by Pi Fu)</p>
<p>The British political system can be described as a government accountable to Parliament, but it must be remembered that this responsibility is not only to the majority in Parliament or the party organization that produces that majority. The first thing cabinet ministers do after taking office is to be responsible to the King for protecting the interests of the country and the empire. As far as members of Parliament are concerned, they are responsible to the entire Parliament, and at the same time responsible to the people of the whole country, to make Parliament the center of the country's life, responsible for ensuring full and free discussion of every policy, and responsible for supporting the dignity of justice presided over by the Speaker. Beyond these responsibilities, as leading figures in their respective parties, they have a responsibility to develop the characteristics of the party and to promote the interests of the party.</p>
<p>The term "responsibility," however, has two meanings: it not only means being accountable to the authorities on the surface, but also having an independent sense of weighing the importance of things and making decisions at the right time. The approval or disapproval of others can be ignored. The British government is not only responsible to the authority that has appointed it, in the same way that an ordinary manager is responsible to shareholders and bosses, but is an independent group. After taking office, it is responsible for leading the country and Parliament based on its own judgment and beliefs. In every respect, the responsibilities of the opposition party are no less than those of the government and the government's supporters. The opposition party is responsible for criticizing in Parliament, and at the same time must explain its claims so that public opinion believes it is qualified to govern. The combination of responsible leadership on the government's side and responsible criticism on the Parliament's side is the soul of the British constitution. Every era needs to change the external institutions of the constitution, or make partial adjustments to it. This evolution is inevitable, but we must try to preserve its main soul.</p>
<p>We cannot deny that the demands on our constitutional institutions are continuing to increase, and both the government and Parliament tend to be overwhelmed. In a state of physical and mental exhaustion, the blood vessels of the British constitutional system are beginning to feel the pain of high blood pressure. How can we make them withstand the more tense situation in the near future? How can we expand these blood vessels so that they can transport the amount of blood that the heart must supply, so that the body can cope with new tasks? In other words, how can we make parliamentary debate competent? We know that this point is very important for a free political system. It is nothing less than a fortress against dictatorship and autocracy. How do we distribute the work of the mind and body so as not to overwork or waste energy? In other words, how can we, within the framework of the current cabinet system, give appropriate importance and power to the side that designs and plans?</p>
<p>Regarding the latter point, I believe that the time has come to hand over the highest power of the cabinet to a small group of no more than six cabinet members, each of whom is responsible not for the administration of mutually related parts, but for its policy. I must remind readers that a similar system was successfully tested during the First World War in the war cabinet, and the current government seems to be moving in this direction, at least in terms of defense and economic policies.</p>
<p>Regarding the question of how Parliament can cope with its work, many people have offered opinions. Here, I can only point out the importance of these opinions, and I do not intend to discuss their content further. Whether some of Parliament's work can be transferred to provincial governments, or legislative bodies similar to those established in Northern Ireland, is at least worth discussing in detail. In my personal opinion, in any case, in order for Parliament to cope with the heavy workload, it must be expanded. One place that I think can be fully utilized is the House of Lords. I must state that I do not intend to use this to counter the House of Commons. I only hope that the House of Lords will be more broadly representative, and at the same time establish a system of life members to maintain the main characteristic of individual transcendence. In addition, I hope that after the number of members is expanded, all necessary reforms can be made without destroying good traditions.</p>
<p>My personal opinion does not end there. Economic and industrial issues have become so important today that I believe that before they are dealt with by the resolutions of the House of Commons, they must be given full and practical discussion, and it should be completely separated from purely party theories and procedures. Years ago, Churchill proposed the establishment of an industrial council, composed of representatives from both labor and management, with the power to deal with social and industrial issues within the scope of guidance, and to draw conclusions from it and send them to Parliament for reference.</p>
<p>I believe that such a group will absorb the best people from both labor and management in the industry, and in particular will give both labor and management activities a new model and greater responsibility. Today, we have seen that Parliament is gradually being excluded from direct negotiations between the government and outside groups. These negotiations are inevitable, but in my opinion, the best answer to this crisis is to bring these relevant things back into the scope and responsibility of parliamentary institutions.</p>
<p>Making Parliament the center and focus of the country's political life, and ensuring that all issues that arise are fully, freely, and responsibly discussed in Parliament, and not allowing power to fall into the hands of irresponsible groups outside the circle, whether they are official institutions or industrial groups, should be the greatest goal of each of us who cherishes a free political system.

Amery of the UK on the BBC, and was later published in the Listener magazine. In the face of turbulent political turmoil in Europe, the UK has been able to remain stable, which is not accidental.

If a timely decision cannot be made because further investigation is necessary, a guarantor should be sought to await the decision. Detention must not be arbitrarily imposed. (3) When punishing violators of police regulations, the violator's identity and the circumstances of the violation should be considered. Fines should be imposed accordingly, and detention or penal labor should not be decided lightly.</p>

<p>Interrogation Attitude Should Be Sincere</p>
<p>(3) The interrogation should be conducted with a sincere attitude, and the interrogated person should be given the opportunity to clarify the suspicion of the crime. All statements, whether favorable or unfavorable, should be noted, and no violence, coercion, fraud, inducement, or other improper methods should be used.</p>
<p>(4) The custody and detention of criminal suspects should be limited to what is necessary to maintain the purpose of the detention and the order of the detention center. Unless there is a risk of violence or suicide, their bodies must not be restrained.</p>
<p>(5) Criminal suspects who have committed crimes with the most severe possible sentence of imprisonment of six months or less, detention, or fines exclusively, must not be subject to application for custody.</p>
<p>A Receipt Should Be Given for Items Seized During a Search</p>
<p>(6) If the establishment of a crime depends on a civil legal relationship, the suspect should be released on bail immediately after the interrogation, and no application for custody should be made.</p>
<p>(7) Homes and other places must not be searched directly unless one of the following circumstances exists: (1) Those who should be arrested or subjected to detention and custody according to law; (2) Those pursuing a current felon or arresting an escapee; (3) Those with facts sufficient to believe that someone inside is committing a crime and the situation is urgent.</p>
<p>(8) When entering a person's home to search, the resident, guardian, neighbor, or staff of the local self-government organization should be ordered to be present and must not be deliberately violated.</p>
<p>(9) Regarding items seized during a search that are deemed admissible as evidence and should be impounded, a receipt should be made, detailing the name and quantity of the impounded items. The people present as witnesses should jointly sign and seal the receipt and hand it over to the owner or manager, and it must not be casually taken away."</p>

<h3>Demanding the Release of Three Colleagues: The Bank of China Enters a Slowdown State, but Resumes Normal Operations After Persuasion from the Authorities</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] Employees of the Four Banks and Two Bureaus had previously attempted to launch a "delaying work" (extending working hours) campaign on the 8th of this month to demand improved treatment, but it was unsuccessful. At that time, three employees of the Bank of China, Zhang Songci, Liu Shanchang, and Zhou Yaojin, were arrested by the security authorities because they were considered to be the leading figures of the "Liaison Association of Employees of the Four Banks and Two Bureaus." As of yesterday, the 5th, they had not yet been released. Yesterday morning, the family members of Zhang Songci and others, bringing the old and young, went to the Bank of China on the Bund, crying and appealing to their colleagues. Colleagues in various departments expressed deep sympathy and requested the Bank of China authorities to appeal to the municipal government for their prompt release. Starting at 9:30 a.m., all employees of the National Foreign Exchange Department, Trust Department, Savings Department, and Shanghai Branch of the head office entered a state similar to a work slowdown. Yesterday happened to be a weekend, and business was particularly busy, so customers waiting outside the counters to complete various procedures were very anxious. Song Hanzhang, the general manager of the Bank of China, personally persuaded and explained to the employees and went to the municipal government to intercede on their behalf, requesting the release of Zhang Songci and others. It is reported that Secretary-General Shen of the municipal government has verbally agreed to handle the case as soon as Mayor Wu returns from Hangzhou. After Mr. Song returned to the bank, he summoned the employees to give a speech in the restaurant on the fourth floor and reported on the progress of the negotiations. All the employees felt satisfied. By about 1 p.m., everything had returned to normal, and the receipt and exchange of bills of exchange and other businesses were not affected.</p>
<h3>Accused of Embezzlement in Manufacturing Coal Balls: Former Manager of Quanneng Factory on Trial; Claims Mud Was Not Mixed Evenly; Embezzlement of Dividends Not Prosecuted Due to Amnesty</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] The case of Yao Linsheng, the former manager of the Quanneng Coal Ball Factory in this city, being accused of malpractice, was publicly tried in court yesterday after being prosecuted by the District Procuratorate. The verdict is scheduled to be announced on the 19th of this month. Yao once served as the manager of the Quanneng Coal Ball Factory and left office in June last year. During his tenure as manager, he was accused of embezzling dividends and profits, and privately selling 15 tons of the 500,000 tons of coal powder allocated to him, and mixing in inferior coal powder. In addition, the coal balls manufactured by the Quanneng Coal Factory, entrusted by government agencies to manufacture coal balls for civil servants and teachers, were substandard and were confirmed by the Fuel Management Committee's inspection. Subsequently, the Material Supply Review Committee for Civil Servants and Teachers in this city and Li Jianrong, a shareholder of the factory, filed a complaint. After investigation by the District Procuratorate, the embezzlement of dividends and profits occurred before 1946 and met the conditions for the amnesty, so it was not prosecuted. As for the private sale of coal powder and the manufacture of substandard coal balls, he was prosecuted for embezzlement. Yao argued in court yesterday that the coal powder part had been reported to the Fuel Management Committee, and the heating value of the manufactured coal balls was standardized at 640 degrees. Sometimes, because the technicians did not mix the auxiliary fuel mud evenly, the firepower was sometimes strong and sometimes weak. He denied embezzlement. After the final court hearing, the date for the verdict was scheduled.</p>
<h3>Transportation Company Employee Steals and Sells a Large Batch of Cloth; Suspect and Stolen Goods Apprehended in Wuxi</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] At about 7 p.m. on the 3rd of this month, Jiang Xiankui, the person in charge of the Ji Transport Company at 126 Hankou Road, reported to the Xinshijie Police Sub-Bureau that Chen Kechang, an employee of the company, had taken two warehouse receipts and withdrawn a total of 320 pieces of flower and bird brand white cloth from the China Textile Construction Third Warehouse on Changyang Road and loaded them onto a flatbed truck, but his whereabouts were unknown. After receiving the report, Wang Jianxin, the chief of the sub-bureau, instructed Section Chief Liu Lianfang to dispatch police officers to investigate. As a result, it was learned that the flatbed truck was No. 1818, and the flatbed truck driver was named Li Gongxing. He was summoned to the bureau for questioning and confessed that a total of four bundles of white cloth were unloaded at the vacant lots on Zhoushan Road and Yuezhou Road, and at the Xinlajiqiao Wharf. Afterwards, he received a freight fee of 550,000 yuan, and he knew nothing else. Subsequently, section member Lu Zhao, police chief Zhao Bingyue, Zhang Xu, and others were dispatched to conduct an investigation. Later, it was learned that the main suspect, Chen Kechang, often went to the Xian Shi Amusement Park to play, so police officers were dispatched to guard the park for several days, but to no avail. It was not until the morning of the 12th that it was learned that Qin Xikun, Ding Haiquan, Zhou Jinmao, Xu Xinzuo, Yang Guan'gen, and other five workers at the Lu Taixing Iron Factory at 288 Lane, Anguo Road, were all from Wuxi and had successively disappeared without a trace four days later. It was investigated and found to be related to this case. At 5 p.m. that afternoon, police officers from the Shanyuan Office tracked and went to Wuxi. After inquiring in many ways, they learned that they were hiding in Room 221 of the Zhongnan Hotel on Wuxi Tongyun Road. When they asked the waiter, it was said that the guests in the room had all gone out. The police officers hid in the room, and two plainclothes officers were left in the lobby. Before long, the main suspect Chen Kechang and Qin Xikun and others returned to the room one after another and were arrested one by one. At about 8 a.m. on the 10th, the local county police bureau was jointly dispatched to assist, and the original stolen goods were hoisted out of the Jiangxi Bridge, six miles away from the city. At the same time, the receivers Ni Pan and Hua Xiliang were also arrested. By yesterday morning, the people and stolen goods were escorted to Shanghai together. After interrogation, they confessed to embezzling, stealing, and selling white cloth. After taking their statements in the afternoon, they were transferred to the District Procuratorate for punishment on charges of embezzlement and receiving stolen goods.</p>
<h3>Shanghai-Hangzhou Freight Train Derails at West Station; Two Sections Overturn; Fortunately, No Casualties</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] The 68th Hangzhou-Jiaxing mixed train on the Shanghai-Hangzhou line arrived at the West Station of this city at 6:40 p.m. yesterday. When changing tracks in the third parallel track, it suddenly derailed, and the last two freight cars overturned. Several sections of the track were damaged, but fortunately, all that was loaded in the cars were radishes and there were no passengers. After receiving the news, the Engineering Section immediately sent workers to rush to repair the tracks.

<h3>Penalties for Automobile Construction Donations Are Appropriately Reduced This Year</h3>
<p>The original penalty measures for automobile municipal construction donations in this city stipulated that those overdue for more than three days and less than one month would be penalized by adding 10% of the donation amount, and those overdue for more than one month would be penalized by adding one time the donation amount. Since the implementation, it has been felt to be too heavy. The municipal government has recently decided to reduce the penalties starting from this year. The three revised new measures are as follows: (1) Those overdue within 10 days will be charged a fine of one-tenth of the donation amount due; (2) Those overdue within 20 days will be charged a fine of two-tenths of the donation amount due; (3) Those overdue for 30 days will have their driver's license withheld.</p>

<h3>Regarding the Registration of Population Migration: Still Handled by Autonomous Organizations; Director of the Civil Affairs Bureau Releases Statement</h3>
<p>According to a statement released by Zhang Xiaosong, Director of the Civil Affairs Bureau of the municipal government, regarding the change of population migration registration to be handled by the police, how the powers of the Civil Affairs Bureau and the Police Bureau are divided is still unclear to the outside world. It has been investigated that the Civil Affairs Bureau previously received and issued to subordinate agencies the eight key points for police agencies and household registration agencies to investigate and report household registration, as promulgated by the Ministry of Interior, among which the fourth item stipulates that applications for population migration registration should be handled by the police agencies. This does not clarify the previous connection between the household registration registration handled by the Bureau and the police agencies. In this city, not only migration registration, but also other types of household registration registration, have a notification slip attached to the application form. Each district security officer notifies the police agency to register after accepting the application for registration for investigation.</p>
<p>The autonomous organizations in this city are currently handling conscription business directly related to suppressing the rebellion, and the overall distribution of resources for stabilizing people's livelihoods, all of which rely on the accuracy of household registration registration. The frequent migration of the urban population accounts for almost the main part of all household registration registration. If migration registration is handled by the police agency, and the autonomous organization cannot grasp the accuracy of the overall population at any time, then the handling of people's livelihood distribution and conscription business will inevitably fail. For example, a certain agency in Huangpu District recently suddenly applied to move out more than 200 young men in an attempt to evade military service. In view of this, the Municipal Council passed a resolution and telegraphed the Ministry of Interior to withdraw the order, and the registration of citizen migration is still handled by the autonomous organizations. For the needs of the business, I have also met with Ren Xianqun, Director of the Civil Affairs Investigation Committee, to request instructions from Mayor Wu, and after receiving a personal discussion, in order to facilitate the direct and flexible handling of conscription and distribution, it was approved to follow the decision of the Municipal Council that the household registration agency directly handle migration registration. However, the population of this city is mixed and changes are large. The autonomous organizations rely on the assistance of the police agency more than ever, and the police agency itself also needs to understand the population situation in this city based on the needs of security. It is hoped that they can provide more assistance in accordance with Article 5 of the Detailed Rules for the Implementation of the Household Registration Law, "In existing police districts, police agencies should assign police officers to assist household registration personnel in handling investigations...," which will be more beneficial to the future of household registration.</p>

<h3>Qingzhi Temple in Lianjiang; Visiting the Bone Storage Pagoda of the Late Chairman Lin</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper in Fuzhou, dated 8th] It has been five years since the passing of the late Chairman Lin. As for the death of this elder, who presided over the central government for nearly a decade and was deeply respected by people at home and abroad, his post-mortem situation should be something that people want to know.</p>
<p>The elder was frugal and generous throughout his life, with no savings in his family. His only interest was in associating with monks and Taoists. During his time in Fujian, he spent half of his time sitting around playing chess, brewing tea, and discussing scriptures. He traveled extensively to various temples in the county, such as Tongquan Temple in Gushan and Shengsui Temple in Luoyuan, but he was particularly admiring of Qingzhi Temple in Lianjiang. More than 20 years ago, when he returned after serving as Speaker of the Senate, he built a bone storage pagoda on the sunny side of the mountain, stating that he would be buried in this mountain after his death. Since then, whenever he wrote or composed poetry, he always signed "Qingzhi Elder." The elder's love for this temple was to this extent. After the outbreak of the Anti-Japanese War, the National Government retreated westward. Five years later, he passed away from a long illness. At that time, the central government, in order to give preferential treatment to this</p>
<p>Founder of the Nation, did not allow the remains to be transported a long distance, and buried him in a mountain cave in the temporary capital. After the victory, the elders of Fujian repeatedly made suggestions on this matter. After weighing the pros and cons, the Executive Yuan approved the reconstruction of a cenotaph at Qingzhi Temple in Fujian, and allocated 200 million yuan a month ago to order its repair, which can also express the central government's love and cherishing of the revolutionary founder's legacy. Local elders, the Lin clan, and the Provincial Construction Department have conducted several surveys.</p>
<p>A reporter visited the area in person a few days ago. The mountain is in Guanlang Town, Lianjiang. This town is the starting point of the Guanfen section of the first national highway between Fujian and Zhejiang. It is located at the source of the Min River and can be said to be the transportation hub between the provincial capital and more than a dozen counties in eastern Fujian. It can be reached by speedboat from Fuzhou in three to four hours. From Guanlang Town to the foot of the mountain is about five li. Climbing up the steps along the west side of the mountain, there are many</p>
<p>Splendid Lin Stones, with jagged rocks, towering peaks, and caves, such as Bat Cave and Seven Void Cave, which are among the best. There are also many villas such as "Xuyuan," and the environment is very beautiful. Qingzhi Temple is located halfway up the mountain. In front of the temple, ancient trees tower into the sky. Inside, the painted pillars are always new. When asked, Wan Zhang replied: This was built by Lin when he returned home in 1934. The temple is divided into three halls, front, middle, and back, and the decoration is very elegant. The monks in the temple also vividly describe the anecdotes of the late Lin in those years. It is said that whenever Lin returned home, the villagers would support the old and carry the young to welcome him. Lin especially liked to go along the mountain for dozens of miles on sunny and breezy days (according to: Lin's ancestral home is Shanggan Fenghang Village) to climb mountains and appreciate the scenery. He was in</p>
<p>Side of Qingzhi Temple, another villa, Xiaoyu Villa, was built, with a Songfeng Pavilion on top. Each time he stayed there for a short time, quietly watching the waves. It is said that there are a total of 108 scenes before and after the mountain, with names such as "Stone Guanyin," "Stone Elephant," "Three Toads," "Stone Immortal Peach," "Damen Cave," "Su Wu Herding Sheep," "Immortal Rowing," etc., which are countless. The reporter invited them to accompany him and visited them one by one.</p>
<p>In the afternoon, I went down the mountain to survey the bone storage pagoda. The carved place is about a few hundred paces away from the temple. It is a platform beside the mountain, with an area of about dozens of feet, bounded by a short wall. The surrounding trees are lush, and the ancient stones are mossy, which is extremely quiet and peaceful. There is an iron railing across the entrance, inlaid with an iron lock. Inside, there are cloisters around, and in the middle, there are five stone steps and a three-story stone pagoda, built of bluestone. The project is quite sophisticated. There is a monument on the front of the pagoda, with the inscription: "Bone Storage Pagoda of Lin Sen, Speaker of the Senate," in seal script, and the words are vigorous. In addition to a few stone benches and flower railings, there is nothing else inside. The walls are covered with vines and trees, and the corners of the ground are covered with weeds, showing a desolate scene. It is reported that the future</p>
<p>"Cenotaph" is also intended to be renovated and completed here.</p>
<p>After returning, the reporter asked the officials involved in the construction plan about this matter. According to reports: Regarding the bone storage pagoda, the base stone will be added around the base of the pagoda to prevent rainwater from entering and damaging the base. Behind the pagoda, there is a three-foot stone cave in the wilderness, which is planned to be renovated for burying ashes or placing clothes in the future. As for the stone monument on the front, it is planned to be changed to "Cenotaph of the Late Chairman Lin of the National Government" by famous craftsmen. The stone monument on the reverse side will be used to engrave the tomb record for permanent commemoration.</p>
<p>Xiaoyu Villa is built on the mountain, and the tide is not suitable, so it is planned to cut off a few feet of the strict stone behind the mountain, raise the roof, and open doors and windows to circulate air and prevent wind and rain. According to Jiang Yuancheng, a famous stonemason who went to the survey together: The bone storage pagoda was built by him in those years. Now he is old (67 years old) and unable to do it himself, but he is grateful for the late Chairman Lin's kindness during his lifetime, and he is willing to return to his ancestral home in Nan'an to solicit famous craftsmen to build it here. The total construction cost is estimated by him to be more than 1 billion yuan, which may be subsidized by the Executive Yuan or raised by his fellow villagers. Jiang's spirit is still vigorous, saying that the stone lions donated by Fujian Province to the Sun Yat-sen Mausoleum in Nanjing in those years were also made by him, and he was the late Chairman Lin's oldest "patron."

<h3>Nouveau Riche in Yinzhou, Wang Shankang, Coveted by Bandits; Wife Killed, Husband Kidnapped</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper in Ningbo, dated 11th] The Zhougongzhai area in western Yinzhou has steep mountains and remote locations, which is where bandits haunt. There is a nouveau riche named Wang Shankang, who recently started construction on a vacant lot in his ancestral home, building a two-story Western-style house. It was completed a month ago, and Wang took his family back from Shanghai to live in the new house and enjoy the tranquility of the forest, which aroused the covetousness of bandits. Late last night, when Wang's family was fast asleep, they suddenly heard urgent knocking on the door. Wang heard the sound and ordered his servant, Abao, to go to the door to see. The bandits said that they had come from Shanghai to Ningbo to visit Mr. Wang for important business. Abao did not suspect anything else and opened the door to invite them in. After the door was opened, he saw that the visitors were all dressed in blue short coats, holding flashlights, and three or four of them were holding wooden shells (guns). The bandits pointed the guns at Abao's chest and told him not to make a sound, then swaggered in. Wang saw that Abao had been out for a long time and had not come in, so he took a lantern downstairs to investigate. He met the bandits, who tied Wang up. They then jumped upstairs. Wang's wife, Zhou, shouted loudly, which angered the bandits. With a bang, she fell on the bed. The bandits then rummaged through boxes and cabinets, searching wildly for more than an hour, and took Wang with them before leaving with a roar. Before leaving, they left a letter stating that they needed 500 million yuan for ransom, otherwise they would tear up the ticket. The next morning, Wang's relatives and friends heard the news and hurried to the Suijing Office to report and request strict investigation and legal action.</p>

<h3>Interlude in Conscription; The Japanese are Here</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper in Wujin, dated 12th] The Jiufengxi Township Office in this county recently urgently needed to meet the conscription deadline.

He was injured in 1945 and was now discharged from the Henglin Rear Hospital after being cured. The Township Office thought it was correct and sent him directly to the new soldier conscription office. However, when the office inquired about the household registration of the baojia, Li was unable to answer. At first, he claimed to be Taiwanese, then he spoke in incomprehensible words. It was then realized that he was Japanese. However, his origin was unknown, and he may have escaped from a prisoner-of-war camp in Nanjing. The office detained him and summoned the introducers for questioning, and handed them all over to the county government for interrogation.</p>

<h3>Gambler's Dead End; Lying on Rails Seeking Death</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper in Chongming, dated 12th] Yu Qigou, a resident of Chenjia Town, was addicted to gambling and had a huge loss since the Spring Festival, which he was unable to pay back. He had once attempted suicide by hanging but was saved.

Fortunately, the driver braked immediately, and he was not run over and killed, but only suffered injuries to his hands and feet.</p>
<h3>Visiting Sun Yuanliang After the Recovery of Xuchang</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper in Zhengzhou, dated 8th] The reporter started from Zhengzhou, hoping to arrive in the city on the day of the recovery of Xuchang, because the news of the recovery had not yet reached my ears. I did not know that General Sun Yuanliang and the vanguard troops had entered the city together that day. That day, a commissioner said to us, "General Sun, coming out of Sichuan, immediately opened up the Pinghan Line as soon as he arrived at the front line, and he was successful." Yes, General Sun had just come out of Chongqing and immediately showed his skills. In fact, in the history of the Anti-Japanese War, he had already written the glorious record of the Battle of Miaohangzhen, which made the international community recognize "This is the first time that the Chinese army fought the Japanese army and defeated the Japanese army on the battlefield." In the end, he defeated the Japanese army in important places such as Dushan Nanzhou, and wrote the final page that contributed to the collapse of the Japanese army. This history of the Anti-Japanese War seems to have been started by him and ended by him, which is very coincidental.</p>
<p>He told the reporter frankly: "In the past, we underestimated the strength of the bandits, so sometimes we inevitably suffered some small losses, but it is also wrong for us to overestimate the strength of the bandits now." He spoke so frankly that it immediately reminded people of when he was in Chongqing, someone advised him to govern the chaotic world with heavy penalties, and he replied: "I am a soldier who serves the public and abides by the law. Heavy penalties can only be used legally." He is not only rational but also extremely enthusiastic. He told the reporter that he was very moved by the welcome he received from the people when he entered the city.</p>
<p>He is only forty-four years old and very handsome. This handsomeness is expressed on the one hand in his conversation and on the other hand in his handsome appearance. He is very rare among Chinese generals. In the past two years, he has been very sad for China because of the bandits' disturbances. He believes that now the bandits must be suppressed by attacking the main force, so that they cannot flee east and west. He is very optimistic about everything.</p>
<p>General Sun does not smoke, does not drink, and is humble and modest to people. These qualities are all in line with the virtues of his uncle, General Sun Decao. He said that he loves the north and likes the plains, which shows his broad-mindedness, even though he grew up in the mountains.</p>
<p>After the recovery of Xuchang, he hopes that the people who have fled, especially those responsible for local affairs, will return as soon as possible, because everything must be done by everyone in order to do it well. (Reported by our reporter Fan Shiqin)</p>

<h3>Tomorrow's Start to Purchase Export Goods; Appraisal Committee Formally Established Yesterday; Locations Tentatively Set at Shanghai, Guangzhou, and Wuzhou; Purchase Prices to be Announced Daily by the China Trust Bureau</h3>
<p>[Our Report] The Export Goods Appraisal Committee convened its inaugural meeting at 2:30 PM yesterday. Representatives from various units attended, including Chen Shangren from the Export Control Commission, Shao Zenghua from the Central Bank, He Tanlin from the China Trust Bureau, Zhang Shenghua from the Ministry of Economic Affairs, and Diao Minren from the Four Banks Joint Treasury, totaling six individuals. The representative from the Ministry of Finance, Shang Zhu, was appointed. The meeting adjourned around 5 PM.</p>
<p>Several important resolutions were reached at yesterday's meeting: (1) The organizational regulations of the Appraisal Committee were approved, pending submission to the Export Control Commission for review. (2) The Export Control Commission, the Central Bank, and the China Trust Bureau were mutually elected as standing committee members. (3) It was decided to initially purchase tung oil, with purchasing locations tentatively set at Shanghai, Guangzhou, and Wuzhou. Furthermore, it was decided that the maximum purchase price would be communicated by the China Trust Bureau to its branches in various locations. Starting next week, these branches would determine prices within this maximum limit and announce them daily. (4) The Appraisal Committee is scheduled to hold a regular meeting every Saturday.</p>
<p>Chen Junren, Director of the Export Promotion Department of the Export Control Commission, met with reporters after the meeting, stating: Since the National Economic Council decided to purchase seven major export goods, including tung oil, hog bristles, raw silk, tea, soybeans, eggs, and wool, the principles and methods of purchase have yet to be finalized, but to save time, preparations must begin immediately. Because the international market price of tung oil has fallen sharply, to protect the legitimate profits of merchants, purchases will be made first. However, this time, purchases are limited to Shanghai, Guangzhou, and Wuzhou to avoid competing with the people for profit. Moreover, purchases are purely voluntary and not compulsory. Purchase prices will be based on market prices.</p>

<h3>Market Rumors Boost Buying; Chinese Stocks Turn Buoyant at Closing</h3>
<p>Chinese stocks were sluggish yesterday morning but buoyant in the afternoon. Generally, due to abundant cash flow and deposit accounts, there was some liquidation. However, major players and younger investors took profits and re-entered, and the current deferred interest rate even approached forty cents. Midday saw some trading, and the stimulation of buying rumors before the close unexpectedly reversed the trend, ending bullishly at high levels.</p>
<p>Starting weak in the morning, Wing On Spinning opened at 1405 yuan and 1490 yuan, quickly falling to low prices of 1380 yuan and 1465 yuan. Buyers emerged, pushing the price back up to 1415 yuan and 1502 yuan. However, with tight cash flow, the current deferred rate widened, leading to some pullback, falling to 1395 yuan and 1480 yuan. Another round of buying pushed the price to 1428 yuan and 1518 yuan, but it soon retreated again to 1400 yuan and 1483 yuan. Later, rumors of a strike at the Bank of China, brisk sales of yarn and cloth, and the arrival of documents regarding reduced certification, boosted confidence again. People eagerly bought, and the price rose to highs of 1428 yuan and 1523 yuan at the close, ending at 1428 yuan and 1522 yuan. Compared to the previous close, Sino-French, Jingfu, China Silk, and Tongyi were flat; Wing On Spinning, Mayer &amp; Feisal, Sincere, Wah Feng, Sun Kwong, Match, China Cement, China Textile, and Zhabei rose slightly; Wah Hsin, New China, National Products, Kin Hing, Jing Lun, Li An, Wing Kung, and Rong Feng declined slightly; Underwear and Commercial each rose by half a cent; and Da Tung, Chung Hsing, and Heng Feng fell by half a cent. In deferred delivery shares, Wah Feng, Jingfu, and Kin Hing declined slightly, while Wing On Spinning, Sincere, Sun Kwong, and Mayer &amp; Feisal rose slightly. Among unlisted stocks traded off the exchange, the Bank of China fell by half a cent, the weakest performer. Hua Cheng remained stable, while the rest declined slightly.</p>
<h3>Unified Bonds Rebound; Foreign Stocks Slightly Higher</h3>
<p>Government bonds fell back somewhat yesterday. Unified C bonds started at 126,000, falling to a low of 116,000 before rebounding and trading sideways. Compared to the previous close, A, B, and D bonds each fell by 6,000 yuan, C bonds fell by 9,000 yuan, and E bonds fell by 7,000 yuan. Turnover was approximately 4 million.</p>
<p>Foreign stocks continued to advance yesterday. Ewo Yarns started at 1.75 million, rebounding to a high of 1.86 million before trading sideways. Except for a slight decline in Telephone, Steel rose the most. Guangdong buyers absorbed some, and as a result, compared to the previous close, Telephone fell slightly, while Hongkong Land, Jardine Matheson, and Ewo Yarns rose by half a cent. Paper was flat, while Ewo Flat, Wheelock Marden, Jardine Engineering, and Guangdong rose slightly. Steel rose by ten percent.</p>
<h3>No Increase in Export Financing; Salt Transport Facing a Precarious Situation</h3>
<p>[Our Report] This reporter has learned from salt merchants in this city that the salt industry, which is crucial to the people's livelihood, is facing a serious crisis. There are approximately 150 salt merchants in this city, who before the war relied on bank export financing for working capital, amounting to about 70% of the salt cost. After the war, currency depreciation and soaring prices have made salt field prices, sack costs, and transportation fees all very expensive. However, the export financing provided to salt merchants by the "Xingdai Banking Syndicate" remains the same as before, with no increase, and has fallen to less than 10% of the salt cost. As a result, salt merchants have had to borrow at high interest rates from external sources to increase capital, with interest rates of over 20%, which must be paid in advance. Thus, the salt cost increases by 20% to 30% every month. In normal circumstances, it takes about four months for salt to be transported from the salt fields to the point of sale, and sometimes it is delayed for six or seven months. According to this calculation, the salt cost increases by more than 100%. However, salt is a designated commodity for sale, and the selling price and sales location are restricted. Therefore, after salt merchants transport and sell the salt, the proceeds are no longer sufficient to purchase the same quantity of salt, causing the quantity of salt to decrease gradually. On one hand, this affects the livelihood of salt farmers in the salt fields and the needs of the people. On the other hand, it causes significant losses in national tax revenue. At the same time, the "Ever-Normal Granary Salt" managed by the salt authorities for daily reserves and regulation is an excellent idea, but the excessive quantity exceeding the limited sales area also strikes a blow to salt merchants. Therefore, salt merchants in this city hope that the government can pay close attention to this crisis and increase export financing for salt merchants in line with salt costs and freight rates, so as to increase the quantity of salt transported, supply the people, and increase national tax revenue.</p>
<h3>After Widespread Rice Rationing, the Rice Market is Stagnant; Rice Prices Fell Uniformly Yesterday in Both Northern and Southern Markets</h3>
<p>[Our Report] Rice prices fell universally yesterday due to (1) tightening credit, (2) reports of small harvests in producing areas, and (3) sluggish sales after widespread rice rationing. Sellers are competing to sell, and prices have been repeatedly lowered. However, due to the increased distribution of household ration rice, the whole city is now widely supplied, and rice stores mainly sell ration rice, without needing to replenish supplies from the market. Therefore, sales are particularly stagnant, and with increased arrivals, there is a situation of supply exceeding demand. In the northern market, white keng rice fell to 3.7 million, thin rice was 3.6 million, and yang hsien rice was 3.65 million. Special high keng rice traded at 3.8 million, each falling by over ten to twenty thousand. However, the market became even weaker towards the close, with declines of over two hundred thousand. The southern market saw a decline from the opening, and it became even more severe later, with almost no one inquiring. Thin rice was 3.6 million, and later, there were prices as low as 3.5 million. The total arrivals in the northern and southern markets yesterday were 10,556 shih.</p>
<p>Flour: With falling rice prices, tight credit, and falling prices in other ports, the market also followed suit. Sellers, needing funds, continued to offer, but buyers, due to the declining market, were afraid to take on too much, and prices fell by thirty to forty thousand yuan in the face of oversupply. Trading was slow.</p>
<p>Miscellaneous Grains: Prices fluctuated. Yellow beans followed the decline in rice prices, and confidence was weak. Buyers from other provinces were not interested, and sellers, facing tight credit, felt they had no way to reverse the situation. Hankou peas fell to 1.75 million yuan, a decrease of 180,000 yuan. The future market remains weak. Pinghu broad beans also fell by 50,000 to 780,000 yuan. Corn, with renewed interest from Qingdao buyers, rose sharply at the beginning of the market, but the market was slightly weaker later, still gaining 150,000 yuan. Red sorghum was in short supply and rose by 100,000 yuan. Green beans also rose sharply. Tianjin buyers purchased sesame, rising by 200,000 yuan. Hankou white sesame was 3.7 million yuan. Shelled peanuts rose sharply, with strong buying from Guangdong. Qinhuangdao shelled peanuts broke through the 5 million mark, rising by 5-600,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Cooking Oil: Began to fall back. Because all grains were falling, confidence was low, and there was not much interest from local buyers. Some small sellers took advantage of the high prices to sell, so the market fell by 250,000 yuan from the opening. Dayouyu and Datong's No. 2 factory both opened soybean oil at 6.95 million, and there were many round-trip trades. Dayou's soybean oil later could not be bought for 6.95 million. The amount of raw oil sold was less than soybean oil. Qingdao Ji brand raw oil opened at 8 million, later 8.1 million yuan, slightly lower by 150,000 yuan. In terms of underlying strength, it was firmer than soybean oil. Round-trip raw vegetable oil was 6.85 million yuan, also falling by over 200,000 yuan. Small cart sesame oil initially opened at 7.7 million, later returning to 7.8 million, falling by 200,000 yuan. Soybean cake, with hesitant buying from the oil gang, fell with Shantou prices. Sipaibing cakes were cut by 3-40,000 yuan each.</p>

<h3>Cotton Yarn Weak; Cloth Declines</h3>
<p>Yesterday's cotton yarn market saw a continued decline in prices due to increased supply, tighter credit among peers, and hesitant interest from buyers from other provinces. Floating holders continued to sell off. However, fine yarn saw some replenishment by weaving businesses taking advantage of low prices near the close. Therefore, the final 42-count Blue Press fine yarn, after falling, rebounded to the original level of 177 million yuan, leveling with the previous day.</p>
<p>40-count Blue Phoenix fine yarn rose by about 1 million yuan. 32-count Double Strand Flourishing Harvest also rose by 2 million yuan. In addition, 21-count Double Horse Yard singles saw increased selling at the midday close due to excess float, falling by 1 million yuan. Spot prices also fell by 1 million yuan. All grades of yarn below 20-count mostly fell again by 5-600,000 to 3-500,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Yesterday's cotton cloth market saw continuous liquidation from buyers due to tightening credit from the morning opening. Combined with the Textile Construction Company opening up ample quotas, the market showed supply exceeding demand. Major players released stocks at high prices, and yarn and flower gangs followed suit. Those buyers from other provinces short on funds also sold off, and pressure from peers was very strong. 12-pound Dragon Head fine cloth fell all the way down, closing at a disastrous 3.49 million yuan, a sharp decline of 240,000 yuan from the previous day.</p>
<p>Zhenzhong, Colorful Ball, Five Blessings, and other fine cloths also fell by 150,000 to 300,000 yuan. However, suddenly, rumors of continued contraction of the Hong Kong electricity supply boosted yarn prices and changed sentiment. Asking prices rose again, and Dragon Head spot prices rebounded to 3.55 million yuan with transactions, and the rest were also higher than the closing prices. Throughout the day, prices of Four Gentlemen, Twilled Serge, and fabric twills all fell by 2-300,000 yuan, but the underlying strength of raw cloth, blue cloth, and Shilin cloth was still stable.</p>
<h3>Silk Trading Quiet; Silk Goods Uniformly Weak</h3>
<p>Artificial silk started weak yesterday but then rebounded firmly, with results similar to the previous day's market. 120-count Asahi brand glossy silk opened at 200 million yuan in the morning, reaching a maximum of 200.3 million yuan in the middle. The midday close fell to 198 million yuan for immediate delivery and 200.8 million yuan for the week of Monday. In the afternoon, it reached a maximum of 14 million, and finally fell back to a selling price of 200.8 million yuan.</p>
<p>Factory Raw Silk: The market was extremely quiet yesterday due to it being Saturday, and the actual selling parties were watching due to the slight decline in the market on the previous day, so there was a lack of transactions. Gao Another refused 280 million yuan, with 12 dan traded. Asking prices for all grades of factory silk and dry silk were the same as the previous day.</p>
<p>Silk Goods: The market fell yesterday. Huaqiang True Silk bedcovers opened within the 100 million yuan mark, and the market fell straight down as the raw materials softened slightly and confidence was inevitably weak. The minimum fell to around 93 million yuan, and the close rose slightly to 97 million yuan for immediate delivery. Grid crepe also fell to within the 400,000 yuan mark, and the close was 410,000 yuan. All other goods were slightly weak.</p>

<h3>Mogao Caves of Dunhuang</h3>
<p>Dunhuang, located more than 1,200 kilometers west of Lanzhou, was as prosperous as Shanghai today from the Qin, Han, Southern and Northern Dynasties to the Sui, Tang, and Song Dynasties, serving as a center for cultural, economic, and political exchange between East and West. The "Mogao Caves" in this oasis in the remote desert, built like beehives on the cliffs of a mountain valley forty miles southeast of the city, are a treasure left to us by our ancestors, worthy of our admiration for the meritorious achievements of those who came before us. In terms of historical research, cultural scholarship, religion, art, and social conditions, it holds unparalleled value.</p>
<p>Since 1907, when the Englishman Stein traveled from India to western Gansu and carried away a large number of ancient manuscripts, paintings, and antiques to London, followed by the French sinologist Paul Pelliot, who specially came to take away a large number of cultural relics, these many documents shocked the literary world worldwide at that time. Those documents also corrected many historical inaccuracies and shortened the road to studying history.</p>
<p>Now, only 309 of the more than 1,000 caves, stretching 1,612 meters in length, remain with immovable and untransportable murals and sculptures, still the richest, most complete, and most systematic cultural relics in the world.</p>
<p>These murals, which can be expanded to a total length of 25 kilometers, and more than 2,000 sculptures, from the Northern Wei, Western Wei, Sui, Tang, Five Dynasties, to the Song and Yuan Dynasties, all represent the different styles of the first era. The works of the Wei Dynasty are bold, monotonous, strange, and unrestrained, representing the form of the initial style. After the short Sui Dynasty to the early Tang Dynasty, there were already significant changes. By the Flourishing Tang period, it had reached the most mature stage, with the beauty of the lines, the accuracy of the outlines, the richness of the colors, and the perfection of the composition reaching the highest peak of art. By the Late Tang, Five Dynasties, and even the Song and Yuan Dynasties, with the changes of the times and the decline of politics and economy, and influenced by the fact that religious art had already formed a category, it also became weak, powerless, and crudely made works.</p>

<h3>On Criticism</h3>
<p>— Xu Ren</p>
<p>Strictly speaking, we really aren't qualified to comment on others. Why is this? I might as well offer two reasons here. First, who is without fault? If a person has no mistakes in dozens of years, he must have been deified from the moment he was born. Many of the things we say about others in our daily lives, upon careful consideration, are no different from the pot calling the kettle black. Superficially, we are discussing others, but in reality, we are slandering our own shadow. Second, the rights and wrongs of the world are not as easy to determine as one might imagine. Zhuangzi said long ago, "This is one right and wrong, that is another right and wrong." But reading various Chinese and foreign ancient and modern theories, for any issue, there is inevitably a "positive argument," a "negative argument," and a "compromise argument." Hegel's "thesis, antithesis, synthesis" philosophy merely illustrates that right and wrong are relative and constantly changing. Therefore, it is not easy to establish absolute standards of right and wrong.</p>
<p>Therefore, unless it is absolutely necessary, we should strictly avoid the habit of casually commenting on people and things. Even if we want to comment on people and things, we must do so with a proactive attitude. We must know that criticism is a kind of construction, not a kind of destruction. The common saying "scolding people" is really not a good example. The person being scolded is unwilling to accept it sincerely, and what result can the person scolding achieve?</p>
<p>What standards do we use to distinguish between constructive criticism and destructive criticism? I believe that constructive criticism must have two conditions. First, the motive for criticism must not be out of self-interest; second, the attitude of criticism must be based on good intentions. If you criticize others from the starting point of your own interests, your point of view will inevitably be wrong, as if you are looking at people with colored glasses. It will be difficult to reach a correct conclusion. For example, last year, "Free Talk" published a cartoon by Mr. Feng Zikai. A cat stole a fish. Mr. Meng's explanation was that the cat stole because it was not full, and the fault was still with the person. Therefore, when criticizing people and things, one must take the other party's position as one's own, put oneself in the other's shoes and think for the other party. This way, one can obtain a correct criticism. Otherwise, one's feelings are confused, one's heart is not right, and the words spoken are inevitably just aimless talk and cannot be called criticism.</p>
<p>Strictly speaking, only constructive criticism is true criticism. It must be understood that criticism is not aimed at venting, but at improving things. Therefore, if the speaker is determined to destroy, his motive must be out of self-interest, and his words will naturally only satisfy his own selfish desires and show off his own prejudices. What good is it for improving things? Looking at the current opinions, we know that there are too many arguments aimed at venting and too few arguments aimed at improving. The result is naturally more destruction than construction.</p>
<p>We must know that destructive things are easier to do, while constructive things are much more difficult. It is easy for bystanders to make comments, but the difficulties faced by those involved in the matter are often unimaginable to those who have not experienced it personally. The common saying "others carrying burdens do not know how hard it is" is the meaning of this. Therefore, when discussing people and things, we must do so with an extremely cautious attitude. The ancient saying "final judgment after the coffin is closed" means that a person's life must still be observed for its subsequent effects.</p>
<p>Today's people's discussion of people and things often goes astray because it is too general. For example, in the current situation of inflation, when people meet, they inevitably say some negative things. The severity of today's economic situation is undeniable, but upon careful study, it is not as serious as most people imagine. You know that current prices are indeed rising, which is a great threat to many people, but today there are many people in society whose income has often exceeded their pre-war income for the same affairs. Today, some people only know that prices are rising, but forget how abundant their income is, and thus express some "blaming the heavens and blaming others" arguments. What is their intention? Furthermore, regarding the issue of economic collapse, I believe that the Chinese people have always valued the doctrine of the mean and inherently have a latent power that is not easy to collapse; this is the first point. My country is an agricultural society, and in today's villages, the economy is often based on physical objects, so the impact of currency changes is not very large; this is the second point. Today's economy is a production problem, not a currency problem. According to personal observation, some people today are constantly making a fuss about the currency problem. I am afraid that there are some who are making malicious predictions, because they have hoarded a lot of goods and are afraid that prices will not rise and the currency will not collapse.</p>
<p>Westerners have a theory that "criticism is sympathy." Presumably, its purpose is nothing more than "putting yourself in the other's shoes and thinking for them." Therefore, only well-intentioned criticism is true criticism, and only constructive criticism can have a reforming effect on society.</p>
<h3>Origins of Common Sayings</h3>
<p>— Jiang Duansheng</p>
<p>Many conversations in the streets and alleys originate from historical books. People often use them habitually without noticing. If one can investigate them slightly, one will surely find it interesting, and one will also know that not a single word is without a source and origin. For example, the common saying "useless" comes from the "Records of the Grand Historian." When Emperor Qin Shi Huang heard that Lu Sheng was secretly criticizing him and had fled, he was furious and said, "I previously collected books from all over the world, and all those that were useless were discarded." Also, "utter defeat" and "rascal" are both found in the "Basic Annals of Gaozu"; "impatient" is found in the biography of Song Gengbing, and also in the "History of the Five Dynasties," when Tang Mingzong was about to establish Empress Cao, he said to Consort Wang, "I am often ill and impatient. Sister should replace me." Cursing people as "mongrels" comes from the eulogy in the "Records of the Former Yan," which says: "Stupid mongrels, what can be done!" The common saying for hiding is "pan," during the time of Chen Houzhu, there was a rumor that said: "Qiyun Temple, when the invaders come, there is nowhere to pan." Saying something is secure is "tuo tie," Du Fu's poem has the line "Thousands of miles are initially secure." Giving gifts is "zuo ren qing," Du Fu's poem has the line "Coarse rice makes human kindness." Something that is empty and lacks substance is "kong tou," which comes from the "History of the Northern Dynasties," Biography of Huliu Jin, which has the line "The empty-headed Han should be killed." A habit is "mao bing," Huang Shangu's "Notes on Documents" says: "This is a Jiangnan person's habit." Hot but not very hot is "wen tun," Bai Letian's poem has the line "The pool water is warm and tepid." As for the common saying for buying things, "buy things," after examining ancient books, I have not been able to find its origin. It is probably due to a misinterpretation. However, according to the "Rabbit Garden Booklet," "During the Chongzhen era, Emperor Sizong established a Recreational Arts Hall to browse through literature, history, and geography. If he had any doubts, he would ask the court officials through the eunuchs. One day, he suddenly ordered a eunuch to ask the court officials, 'Now, in market transactions, people only say buy things, but not north and south. Why is that?' The court officials were caught off guard and could not answer. The assistant minister Zhou Yanru said, 'South is fire, north is water. People who knock on doors in the morning and evening to ask for water and fire will always be given it. This does not require trading, so they only say buy things.' The eunuch reported his words to the emperor, and Emperor Sizong approved of it." Also, I accidentally read a former person's notes, which I remember also discussed this, saying: "East governs birth and development, west governs harvest and storage, or it takes the meaning of east working and west completing." The above two explanations seem quite reasonable. In addition, saying that things are often stored in east-west facing rooms, so things are called "things," is far-fetched and seems unreliable. I specifically write it down to wait for those with broad knowledge.</p>

<h3>Carefree Flowers</h3>
<p>— Chen Shenyan</p>
<p>Chapter 12: A Chance Encounter (97)</p>
<p>Dao Yun continued, "I want to organize a film production company, and for all management and control, I hope that Miss Gu can cooperate with me fully." Qi Wan said, "I'm afraid I don't have the ability." Dao Yun said, "As long as Miss Gu is interested in this career, she will be of great help to me." Qi Wan said, "I am very interested in movies." Dao Yun said, "Then there is no problem. Can Miss Gu come to Shanghai with me?" Qi Wan said, "I have such a plan." Dao Yun said, "Then I don't need to look for a second talent in Beiping. With Miss Gu's help, I can do my job boldly." Qi Wan said, "I can help from the sidelines, but I can't support the whole thing on my own. I don't have the assets or the ability." Dao Yun said, "As for capital, I have already planned it out. What we are discussing now is the talent aspect. Now that Miss Gu is supporting the pillar, I am confident. With a few supporting actors in Shanghai, my film will be a success." As he spoke, he talked endlessly about the preparation process, how much money he had already spent, and how much money the product could earn. He also said that if the film business was run according to his method, it could dominate the film industry in the future. He also said that a certain tycoon in Hong Kong was in contact with him, and as long as this product could win the favor of most audiences, there would be rear support for how much capital to use. That night, Dao Yun talked in Qi Wan's house until after 9 o'clock, when the hospital nurse came to tell him that it was time to rest, and Dao Yun left. Qi Wan was very excited after hearing what he said, and felt that Dao Yun's talent and assets were better than Zhu Zhai's. It was just that he was used to being in the South, and his words did not seem as honest and reliable as Zhu Zhai's, but she couldn't blame him. Anyone who talks about business can't tell the truth. He said that he would cooperate with me, and of course he had other intentions. I will just wait and see what other conditions he has, and then proceed accordingly. Qi Wan was so disturbed by Dao Yun's words that she tossed and turned all night, thinking all night, and couldn't sleep well. The next day, it was only a little after 8 o'clock, and Qi Wan hadn't gotten out of bed yet, when she heard someone gently knocking on the door outside the room. Qi Wan thought it was the nurse, so she responded, "I'm awake, come in." When the door was pushed open, it was Dao Yun, wearing a bathrobe, who walked in. As he walked, he said, "I'm sorry, I didn't know that Miss Gu hadn't gotten up yet. Last night, I couldn't solve a problem that I thought of, so I didn't sleep all night. Today, as soon as it was dawn, I wanted to come over, but I didn't dare to come over, thinking that Miss Gu was already up by this time." As Dao Yun spoke, he had already walked to Qi Wan's bedside. He saw Qi Wan's amorous eyes looking at him affectionately, and he smiled and asked, "What made you unable to sleep?"</p>
<h3>Outside the School Gate</h3>
<p>— Nian Hong</p>
<p>Mentioning reading seems to make one think of school; mentioning seeking knowledge makes one think of teachers. Traditional concepts have dominated us, forming a set of logic that to read and seek knowledge, one must enter school and seek advice from teachers.</p>
<p>These days are the time when various middle schools are starting school one after another. Due to the high tuition fees and the difficulty of obtaining scholarships, there must be many young people who are out of school. Pacing outside the school gate, watching former classmates go to register, they must feel very sad, even resentful and pessimistic. Parents also feel very ashamed and deeply guilty for not being able to let their children receive a complete education, as if they are sorry for their second generation. This kind of mentality is the result of the aforementioned traditional concepts, and there is really no need to think like this.</p>
<p>I am not saying that the scholars do not need to read, but that they do not necessarily have to squeeze into schools to learn from others, and spend a lot of money to obtain some diploma certificates. What we want to learn is true knowledge and true skills, and what parents hope for their children is just a skill, understanding of principles. Try to see if even middle school graduates or university graduates have true knowledge, true skills, a skill, and understanding of principles?</p>
<p>This is definitely not a sour grapes mentality, saying that school is bad because one cannot enter it, a way to comfort oneself. The facts are clearly placed before us, and even educators feel that such education needs to be reformed, so why must we be so attached to it and suffer in vain! The world outside the school is very big, and the time and place to learn are very wide. Why not shift your perspective and observe the endless real life around you, learn in life, temper yourself, and enrich yourself.</p>
<p>Of course, today's schools are also unstable, but compared with society, they still feel too comfortable. Young people should have the courage to face difficulties without fear. Today's society is dark, but we must not hide in a corner for temporary peace because of its darkness. Society itself is a university, this is an old saying. Since this is the case, then study hard in this school to learn some true knowledge.</p>
<p>Experience is skill, and this kind of skill can never be learned in books, but can only be accumulated from life. Moreover, leaving school does not mean leaving books. On the contrary, you can read more good books that you like and continue to learn and improve. Teachers are also not limited to teachers wearing long gowns and holding chalk, gesticulating in the classroom. Anyone who can learn in life can be his teacher. Haven't you heard what Confucius said? Here, I don't want to give examples of someone who succeeded in self-study or someone who didn't go to school. Anyway, the origins of these great men are also familiar to everyone.</p>
<p>Out of school or not, take a big step into the current society!</p>
<p>The Yellow Sea Play and the Taihu Flowers by Half-Dream Old Man</p>
<p>"One play to watch the Yellow Sea, ten thousand branches bloom with Taihu flowers, in my life I have seen natural beauty, and I can't help but feel the spiritual roots sprout." This is my old poem from when I returned from a mountain trip. Besides food, clothing, shelter, and transportation, we should consider "travel" as the most important. Being confined to one corner, busy all day long, not knowing what one is busy with. What I call the Yellow Sea refers to Huangshan in Huizhou, Anhui. Its wonderful scenery is natural and beyond all expectations. Its deep hidden places are all called the sea. The reason why it is called the "sea" is because there are coral islands and other strange crystal formations in the sea, which cannot be manufactured by human power. Over tens of millions of years, they have become an unimaginable state. The low-lying areas of Huangshan also contain these strange objects. The ancients had no way to describe them, so they simply called them the sea, hence the name "Yellow Sea." Among them are the Front Sea, Rear Sea, Heavenly Sea, West Sea, etc. The Rear Sea is behind the Lion Peak, and there are even more strangely shaped mountain peaks. The peaks of the Yellow Sea include the Beauty Looking in the Mirror, Guan Gong Blocking Cao, Dharma Crossing the River, and Sisters Herding Sheep. Generally, they all resemble something. They are named according to what people designate, about one hundred and several tens of places. I once traveled to this place and was amazed, so I called it the "Yellow Sea Play." The plays made by people in the world are nothing more than taking the guise of talented scholars and beautiful women, performing a play of resentful women and infatuated men, or a fight between tigers and dragons, a series of killings and arson. For tens of millions of years, they can't escape the facts recorded in history. Even if they are turned upside down, ministers assassinate kings, and sons assassinate fathers, betraying ethics and destroying righteousness, as fierce as beasts, or staging a bloody revolution, it is nothing more than swinging a grotesque swing in this world. After watching it for a long time, it is ultimately tasteless.</p>
<p>Besides the Yellow Sea Play, there are also the "Taihu Flowers," which must be seen. The largest lake in the southeast is Taihu Lake. Its area is said to be "36,000 qing of vast ocean, submerging 72 peaks." The largest in the lake is West Dongting Mountain, and its highest point is called Misty Peak. There are several mountains near Misty Peak, and the one with the best scenery is called Stone Elder Mountain. From Taihu Lake, Stone Elder Mountain looks like a celestial palace, a natural golden painting. At the foot of the mountain, there is the Washing Stone Residence, and further in is the Returning Cloud Cave. Yi Shifu's poem in the cave says: "Lingering by Stone Elder Mountain, the spring cold in the water country is still like autumn. Heaven outside heaven, boating, a guest within a guest is afraid to climb the tower. The vast smoke stretches for thousands of miles, the scenery is bleak and clear like ten continents. The fine rain and plum blossoms are extremely sad, where does the sound of flutes rise from fishermen?" In front is the Stone Elder Zen Temple, above is the Crane Coming Pavilion, outside is the Evening Light Cave. The Crane Coming Pavilion is the best place in the whole mountain. Opposite West Dongting Mountain is East Dongting Mountain. The highest point of East Mountain is called Mo Li Peak, but it is not as beautiful as West Dongting. Besides the two Dongting mountains, there is also Maqi Mountain, which can also be called majestic on the lake. My fellow villager Chu Jianweng has a chapter inscribed with the seven characters "Watching Ma Mountain from the Wind and Rain." Jianweng also asked me to write "Aotou," "Wangping," "Yungen," "Xuelang," and "Daxiongtai," totaling more than thirty inscriptions, carved on the stone walls of Dalewan, Xiangshan. At that time, I titled below them, saying: "Jianweng, Yunshi, and Cui Ran traveled together to Stone Elder and Linwu, climbed to the two peaks of Misty and Mo Li, and took in all the scenic spots in the lake. Returning here, they moored the boat straight down, and titled the two beautiful stones, Yungen and Xuelang, and then titled the various stones, west to Yutai, a total of more than thirty places, so that they all have good names for the benefit of future travelers. The fifteenth day of the tenth month of Renshen." This matter is now more than ten years ago, and I don't know if it still exists. To see the "Taihu Flowers," Dalewan is the best place. What are the Taihu Flowers? The fishing boats in Taihu Lake, with their sails full of wind, the largest of which have as many as seven sails, arranged vertically and horizontally, look like a flower with seven petals from a distance. Sometimes there are dozens of boats coming and going, almost like a group of flowers in full bloom, blooming all over the lake, which can be called a grand sight. In the vast expanse of 36,000 qing, there is this huge picture, how can one not be amazed! Dalewan belongs to the junction of Yixing and Changxing, Zhejiang, and can be called the extreme west in Taihu Lake. Most of the fishing boats come from the west or from east to west. With their sails full of wind, they must pass in front of Dalewan, so to see the Taihu Flowers, one must be on the road in Dalewan. In the past, Chu Jianweng had built four arches there as a place for tourists to rest. What the scene is like after the turmoil is unknown.</p>
<p>Our feelings change with the environment. If one looks around, the heaven and earth are lonely, and the individual is silently in it, there will be an incredible wave. For religious people, it is appropriate to explore the treasure of self-changing from the extremely profound and silent place, because our mind is forced by the environment, there is no place for scattered dissipation, gather the spirit, invigorate and move forward, and thus open up a strange and unusual realm. These realms cannot be known by those who have not personally experienced them, and they do not need to be known by others. Liang Rengong's "Free Book" once contained an article called "The World Outside the World," which stated: "When General Dixie conquered Egypt, a knight fled to the vast desert. There was no sound, the heaven and earth were lonely, and as far as the eye could see, there was no end. After the loneliness, ten thousand feelings surged. Every day, there must be countless new thoughts, rising and falling suddenly, unable to restrain himself. In the lonely shadow of a person where there are no human voices, he suddenly opened up the secret store of nature and obtained incredible insights. The sun rises and sets, the birds return, all kinds of colors appear in his eyes, and his heart must float a new thought because of it. A lonely moon shines on the sand, and the four directions are brilliant. The cool wind winnows the sand, forming wave lines, moving and surging without rest. Sometimes a storm rages, and towering sand pillars stand up in the empty sky in the hundreds. Suddenly the wind stops, the stars are brilliant, and a refreshing atmosphere suddenly arises, as if listening to the subtle music of the sky in the air, thinking that this joy is something he has never encountered in his life, and the joy is not enough for outsiders to know." It can be seen that there is a special interest in the deserted and uninhabited realm. There is a barren beach in Taihu Lake, about several acres in size, called Beigui, on which there is a Yu Wang Temple, with only ten or so rooms, the courtyard is full of lush trees, and in the middle stands a pole, about ten or so feet high, for hanging flags. The temple keeper, surnamed Li, has lived here for several generations. When the food is exhausted, he will hang a flag, and fishing boats will come to send supplies. When I arrived at Beigui, I strolled on the beach, and saw the sails and sand birds, vast and boundless. The sunlight shone on the water, shooting out golden light, dazzling to the eyes for dozens of miles around. The scenery was strange and beautiful, indescribable. Sitting quietly on the beach for a while, I had all sorts of thoughts, which were similar to the situation of the Egyptian knight. It is a pity that the temple keeper, surnamed Li, has not studied and missed this wonderful realm of the world.</p>
<h3>How to Improve Shanghai's City Telephone Service</h3>
<p>— Ping</p>
<p>— Excerpts from Director Yu's speech at Jiaotong University</p>
<p>The history of telephones in Shanghai began in the seventh year of Emperor Guangxu's reign during the late Qing Dynasty. A British firm, Ruiji Foreign Company, established the China and Foreign Telephone Company in the former International Settlement, using magneto and common battery switchboards successively. However, there were instances of cross-border telephone lines. In the thirty-second year of Guangxu's reign, the Qing Dynasty's Minister in charge of Telecommunications Affairs established the Shanghai Telephone Bureau in the Nanshi area to safeguard sovereignty. It was established in the thirty-third year of Guangxu's reign, using magneto telephones. In the first year of Emperor Xuantong's reign, the Zhabei branch bureau was added. In the seventh year of the Republic of China, preparations were made to construct the Shanghai-Nanjing long-distance telephone service, with branches in Nanshi, Zhabei, and Pudong. In the eighth year, land was purchased, and the China Electric Company was selected to handle various equipment and materials. The Nanshi branch was upgraded to a common battery exchange with a capacity of 2,000 lines. The Zhabei branch bureau used a magneto exchange with a capacity of 700 lines, and the Pudong branch bureau used a magneto exchange with a capacity of 280 lines. In the ninth year, the Shanghai Jiu Ji Construction Factory was selected to build the buildings. In the tenth year, a female telephone operator training school was established to train telephone operators, graduating in six months. At the same time, internal and external engineering work began. In the eleventh year, telephone service commenced. In the fourteenth year, a connection contract was signed with the China and Foreign Telephone Company. In the fifteenth year, connection began in February. In the nineteenth year, the company was sold to the current American-owned Shanghai Telephone Company, which switched to rotary automatic telephones. At the same time, in order to develop Shanghai's telephone service, the National Government ordered 4,800 lines of step-by-step automatic switching equipment from the American Automatic Electric Company, installing 3,000 lines in the Nanshi bureau, rebuilding the Zhabei branch bureau with 1,500 lines, and adding a city center branch bureau with 300 lines. The installation was completed and telephone service was available in the twenty-second year. Temporary contracts and long-distance contracts were signed with the Shanghai Telephone Company successively. During the Anti-Japanese War, in addition to the enemy and puppet regimes relocating and damaging the equipment in Nanshi and Zhabei, a step-by-step automatic telephone bureau was added in Hongkou. Currently, the Shanghai Telecommunications Bureau of the Ministry of Communications is making every effort to restore them.</p>
<p>The current telephone institutions in Shanghai are one state-owned and one operated by foreign merchants, as mentioned above. The organizations of the two are different, and the systems vary. This not only causes difficulties in management, but also is not in accordance with economic principles, which makes it difficult for the telephone efficiency in this city to be perfect. Citizens cannot enjoy satisfactory service. In order to remedy the above shortcomings, improve telephone efficiency, and rationalize the city's telephone system, it seems necessary to have a unified management organization to be more appropriate. The establishment of this organization can be achieved through the following four methods: (1) The telephone institution operated by foreign merchants in Shanghai should be recovered by the Chinese government with its own funds and operated by the state. (2) All telephone services in Shanghai should be operated by foreign merchants. (3) China and the United States should jointly invest and organize a special limited company in accordance with Chinese law. (4) China and the United States should cooperate and operate and improve separately within their prescribed business areas.</p>
<p>Among them, the first method may be difficult to achieve in the short term given the current period of national financial constraints. The second method concerns China's sovereignty and is not suitable for discussion. Although the third method, where China and the United States jointly invest and organize a limited liability company in accordance with Chinese law, has the advantages of unified organization, uniform procedures, ease of expansion, and uniform and fair user fees, it is still difficult to implement under the current situation and will take a long time. Therefore, the results may not be as quick as the fourth method of Sino-US cooperation.</p>
<p>Now, based on my limited knowledge, I will list the fourth method of Sino-US cooperation in detail as follows: (A) Method: China and the United States should cooperate separately within their prescribed business areas. (B) Business rights: The Chinese government should allow the American-owned Shanghai Telephone Company to continue operating the city telephone service in the former International Settlement and the former French Concession for a certain number of years after reorganization in accordance with Chinese law, and should issue another license in accordance with the Regulations for the Establishment of Private City Telephone Services promulgated by the Ministry of Communications. (C) Temporary contract: The temporary contract signed on April 19 of the twenty-second year of the Republic of China by the Shanghai Telephone Bureau of the Ministry of Communications, the Shanghai Telephone Company, and the Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Public Utilities should be cancelled after this method is formulated. The company should immediately transfer all areas mentioned in the contract where roads were built across the border to the Ministry of Communications, which will be used as part of the business area of the Shanghai Telecommunications Bureau under its jurisdiction. (D) Equipment program: In order to unify the telephone machine program in Shanghai and show cooperation, the Ministry of Communications may relocate the existing step-by-step automatic telephone keys of the Telecommunications Bureau and the common battery manual telephone machines in the area where roads were built across the border to other places for application. All rotary automatic machines should be used uniformly in this city area. (E) Intercommunication of telephones: When users of the Shanghai Telecommunications Bureau and users of the American-owned telephone company communicate with each other by city telephone, the automatic direct dial method should be used completely, and both parties should adhere to the principle of not charging users additional fees. (F) Long-distance telephone connection fee: The company can allow users to directly pay the long-distance telephone fee to the Telecommunications Bureau, or the company can collect the outgoing call bill sent by the Telecommunications Bureau on a monthly basis as an obligation and transfer the full amount of the fee to the Telecommunications Bureau. (G) Filing: The company should be filed with the Ministry of Communications and the Ministry of Economic Affairs of China, and registered with the Shanghai Municipal Government. Commercial activities are subject to the supervision and guidance of the Ministry of Economic Affairs, business activities are subject to the supervision and guidance of the Ministry of Communications, and road construction projects are subject to the supervision and guidance of the Shanghai Municipal Government. (H) Business period: The company's business period and the Ministry of Communications' supervision of the company and the methods for its nationalization shall be handled in accordance with the Regulations for the Establishment of Private City Telephone Services promulgated by the Ministry of Communications and future amendments.</p>
<p>Looking at the above four methods, if the first and third methods cannot be realized temporarily, then for the convenience of citizens and to improve the efficiency of telephone communication, the fourth method of Sino-US cooperation seems to be of value for adoption. As for how to learn from each other's strengths and overcome weaknesses in order to improve Shanghai's telephone business, it still depends on the great teachings of the relevant authorities and domestic talents.</p>
<h3>Development of Domestic Telegraph Business in Shanghai After the War</h3>
<p>— Gao Changshun</p>
<p>"Messages travel thousands of miles in an instant, making the ends of the earth feel like neighbors." Telecommunications is valued for its speed and convenience. During wartime, it coordinates operations and assumes the mission of liaison and command. In peacetime, it communicates culture and promotes social prosperity. If telecommunications were to stop for even one day, news would be isolated, culture would be blocked, and the entire country would be in an unimaginable situation. Therefore, its position in national defense and cultural economy is very important and is becoming increasingly significant with the progress of the times. Since the victory, everything has been revived, and how can we dare to lag behind in the revitalization of our telecommunications industry? Therefore, I have listed the progress of the bureau's telegraph business in the past two years. By observing the present and recalling the past, we can encourage future development.</p>
<p>(1) Substantial replenishment of the interior</p>
<p>When the bureau took over the enemy's and puppet's China Central Electric Communication Company, the original equipment before the war was destroyed. The equipment taken over was mostly dilapidated and simple. After active repairs and a large number of additions, the equipment has increased three to five times compared to the time of takeover, and the number of circuits has increased three to six times.</p>
<p>Regarding wire telegraphy: Currently, the bureau's wire direct circuits reach as far as North China and South China. All branch lines during the war were almost completely destroyed. During the enemy's and puppet's China Central period, wire telegraphy circuits were limited to the Beijing-Shanghai-Hangzhou triangle area. Therefore, since the beginning of the takeover, planning and dispatching have been carried out, and additions have been made gradually. There are currently nine Wheatstone automatic telegraph lines, three sound telegraph lines, and eight voice transmission circuits, totaling twenty circuits. However, due to the fact that the war is not yet over, it is difficult to restore the old appearance for a while. Moreover, although the Hankou and Xuzhou lines have been repaired, they are still damaged from time to time. Therefore, most telegraph business relies on the maintenance of wireless circuits.</p>
<p>Regarding wireless telegraphy: After the war, the bureau's wireless telegraph business developed rapidly. All major cities and towns, as far as all parts of the country, are connected. However, wireless communication is not as stable as wired communication due to the influence of climate and interference. Moreover, the telegraph business is heavy, often exceeding its own capacity. It is necessary to open up two or three more circuits to divert the traffic. Therefore, many wireless circuits have been added. There are eight automatic telegraph lines and twenty-three manual telegraph lines, totaling thirty-one circuits, which is a world of difference compared to the few during the enemy's and puppet's time.</p>
<p>In addition, various latest equipment have been added, such as facsimile machines, teletypewriters, and new wave receivers, which are the most modern communication tools.</p>
<p>(2) Enhance work efficiency</p>
<p>During the Anti-Japanese War, whether in the rear or in the occupied areas, it sometimes took a long time to transmit a telegram. In the early days of the victory, telegram delays and errors were also common. Now telegrams can be delivered smoothly throughout the country. In terms of quantity: Before the war, the daily incoming and outgoing telegrams of this bureau were only a few thousand, but now there are sometimes as many as 30,000 or more. Recently, wireless automatic telegraph circuits are being added one after another to increase the transmission capacity of telegrams. In terms of speed: The time limit for the transmission of various telegrams is also stipulated. Express telegrams can arrive in just one and a half hours. Even ordinary telegrams are required to be delivered within six hours in direct circuits. As for accuracy, the accuracy rate is much higher than during the war. The average error percentage is only 0.115%. In order to eliminate telegram errors, the proofreading work has now been strengthened. Special personnel have been assigned to check the original telegraphs for incoming and transferred telegrams every day, in order to ensure accuracy.</p>
<p>(3) Expanding public services</p>
<p>After the victory, the communication and transportation between Shanghai and other places became increasingly important. The bureau worked hard to achieve progress in an extremely difficult environment with a lack of equipment and manpower, under the goal of "serving the public" and "facilitating customers." Therefore, in terms of business, express telegrams were opened to meet urgent needs, communication telegrams and gift vouchers were restored to facilitate social interaction, travel telegrams were available to facilitate travel, and night letter telegrams were economical and practical for the public to choose from. Regarding convenience for customers: In addition to actively adding 19 branch offices and agency offices, telegraph kiosks were set up at train stations, wharves, and major transportation routes. There is also a mobile telegraph office that drives around the city so that citizens can send telegrams anytime and anywhere. In order to provide more thorough service, a public service counter is set up in the business office, and in order to improve the speed of telegram delivery and facilitate registered users, six-digit registration is implemented. In addition, telephone telegrams and telephone notification of telegram collection are held, and free translation of incoming telegrams are all considered for the public. Moreover, business inspectors often answer questions from all parties and visit users to solicit opinions in order to seek improvement.</p>
<p>Today's telegraph business, although there are some achievements, it is still not satisfactory. I hope that the people of the country will cooperate more to achieve perfection.</p>

<h3>Before and After the Opening of China-UK Wireless Telephone Service</h3>
<p>— Si Sheng</p>
<p>Preparation situation: China and the United Kingdom have very close relations in politics, economy, culture, and other aspects, and the cooperative promotion of the friendly spirit between the two countries depends on telecommunications. Therefore, the opening of China-UK wireless telephone service has great significance. As early as the spring of the 26th year of the Republic of China, the International Radio Station of the Ministry of Communications contacted the British Post Office General Administration to open wireless telephone services and actively made preparations. Unexpectedly, just as it was preparing to make the call, the August 13th Incident occurred. Due to damage to equipment and the relocation of the radio station to the west, the telephone service was suspended.</p>
<p>After the victory, with the cooperation of the Shanghai Telecommunications Bureau and the International Radio Station, telephone service between China and the United States was first restored on July 1. On the one hand, new single-sideband wireless telephone sets were ordered from abroad to be transported to Shanghai. On the other hand, trial calls between China and the United Kingdom began daily from February 3 of this year. Both sides used dual-channel single-sideband, which can open two telephone channels simultaneously. Therefore, the sound quality is extremely clear. In order to prevent special changes in the atmospheric pressure in the sky or lack of smoothness, it is planned to add a 30KW dual-channel single-sideband high-power amplifier to increase the output power from two kilowatts to thirty kilowatts to facilitate telephone calls.</p>
<p>One part of the Zhenru transmitting station equipment room</p>
<p>Equipment characteristics: In order to connect long-distance wireless telephones to ordinary two-wire wired telephones, special wiring equipment must be used to fully express the communication efficiency of this barrier-free telephone. There must be receiving and transmitting stations at considerable distances at both ends of the wireless telephone. This wireless circuit is divided into receiving and transmitting circuits, each of which is equivalent to the two wires of a wired circuit, so there are four wires. The function of the terminal machine can restore it to two wires, which can be connected to ordinary telephone users.</p>
<p>Because wireless telephones are more complex than wired telephones, the branch coil device commonly used in wired circuits is not sufficient for wireless circuits, and wireless terminal equipment must be used. The terminal machine has an automatic voice current adjustment device. Although the user's voice is different, it can still adjust the uniform volume and transmit it to the wireless transmitter for transmission. There is also a set of relays that can be controlled by the voice of telephone users, so that any echo or call in the entire voice channel can be avoided.</p>
<p>The terminal machine also has an automatic volume controller (referred to as "VOGAD") and an automatic call reduction controller (referred to as "VODAS"). The above-mentioned automatic call reduction controller is a secret equipment shared by receiving and transmitting. The function of this secret equipment is to change the voice radio waves so that anyone else listening to wireless telephones cannot hear clearly.</p>
<p>Telephone ceremony: The China-UK telephone ceremony was held on March 4 in the conference room of the Shanghai Telecommunications Bureau at Xujiahui. Two huge Chinese and British flags were hung in the center of the venue, and small Chinese and British national flags were hung on the four walls. At 5:30, the ceremony began. First, Director Yu gave a speech, and then Mr. Lu, the Management Engineer of the International Radio Station, reported on the preparation process. Then, Mayor Wu talked with Smith, the Mayor of London and the current Chairman of the London Chamber of Commerce. After the two mayors ended their call, Mayor Wu talked with Mr. Zheng Tianxi, the Chinese Ambassador to the United Kingdom. After that, the call was connected to Sir Bowes, the leader of the British business delegation who had previously visited Shanghai. Mayor Wu had a pleasant conversation with Mr. Bowes. The humorous and relaxed tone won laughter from the whole audience. (See various local newspapers on March 5 for details.) Then, Mr. Gillett, the British Consul General in Shanghai, talked with Mr. Tan, the Chinese Consul General in London. Finally, Director Yu talked with the Director of the Telecommunications Division of the British Post Office General Administration. The entire ceremony was thus completed.</p>
<p>Telephone time, location, and price</p>
<p>Currently, the telephone locations are temporarily set to Shanghai, Nanjing, and various places in Britain and Northern Ireland. The telephone time is tentatively set to 5:30 PM to 7:30 PM Shanghai time (9:30 AM to 11:30 AM Greenwich Mean Time). Telephone service is closed on Sundays. International telephone calls are charged in gold francs. Currently, one gold franc is equivalent to 49,500 yuan in national currency. The price of China-UK telephone calls is set at 36 gold francs for the first three minutes, which is equivalent to 1,746,000 yuan in national currency, and 12 gold francs per minute for overtime, which is equivalent to 582,000 yuan in national currency. The cancellation fee is 2.4 gold francs, which is equivalent to 118,800 yuan in national currency.</p>
<h3>Telecommunications Knowledge Talk (9)</h3>
<p>— Zhang Jiayu</p>
<p>Lecture 3 How to choose special services (continued)</p>
<p>(8) Personal Delivery: Usually, when we send letters with more important or confidential content, we often add the words "Personal Delivery" under the name of the recipient on the envelope; the purpose of writing these two words is nothing more than to hope that the recipient will open and read it himself. However, the post office still delivers it as usual and does not have the obligation to deliver it to the recipient in person, nor does it charge additional fees. The "Personal Delivery" special service in telegrams is slightly different from postal letters. For telegrams with "Personal Delivery" or =MP= fee identification noted at the beginning of the telegram by the sender, the receiving telegraph office should write "Personal Delivery" or "Personal Delivery" on the telegram envelope when delivering it, and may instruct the messenger delivering the telegram to deliver it to the recipient in person as much as possible. At the very least, the telegram must be delivered only after a stamp (or signature) with the same name as the recipient is affixed to the return receipt. In addition to adding an =MP= fee identification before the recipient's name and address, the "Personal Delivery" special service does not charge any other fees.</p>
<p>(9) Open Delivery: After receiving telegrams from various places, the telegraph office is required to seal the telegram envelope before delivering it to the messenger in order to maintain the confidentiality of communication. If the sender wants to send a telegram that is extremely time-sensitive but does not need to be kept confidential, he can add an "Open Delivery" or =OPEN= fee identification at the beginning of the telegram. After receiving this telegram, the receiving telegraph office will deliver it without sealing it. In this way, if the recipient happens to be away from home when the telegram is delivered, his family or co-residents can receive and handle it on his behalf, so that the opportunity will not be delayed by waiting for the recipient to come back to open and read it himself. In addition to adding an =OPEN= fee identification, the "Open Delivery" special service does not charge any other fees.</p>
<p>(10) Poste Restante: Telegrams sent to passers-by who do not have a fixed address can be sent to the local telegraph office or post office to be kept for the recipient to pick up himself, if the sender and receiver agree on this in advance. The "Poste Restante" special service is divided into "Telegraph Poste Restante" (identification =TR=), "Postal Poste Restante" (identification =GP=), and "Registered Poste Restante" (identification =GPR=) according to three different processing methods. The receiving telegraph office handles telegrams using the "Poste Restante" special service as follows:</p>
<p>"Telegraph Poste Restante" keeps the telegram in the business office of the receiving telegraph office, waiting for the recipient or his representative to come to the office to pick it up. If it is not picked up after forty-two days, the original telegram will be destroyed.</p>
<p>"Postal Poste Restante" "Registered Poste Restante" The receiving telegraph office sends the former by ordinary mail and the latter by registered mail to the local post office for storage, waiting for the recipient or his representative to pick it up at the post office. The storage period is handled in accordance with the regulations of the post office.</p>
<p>For telegrams using the "Poste Restante" special service, in addition to adding the fee identification specified above, "Postal Poste Restante" should be charged ordinary mail postage according to the regulations of the post office, "Registered Poste Restante" should be charged registered mail postage, and "Telegraph Poste Restante" is not charged separately.</p>
<p>(11) Telephone Delivery: Telegrams sent to recipients who have telephones installed in the local area can use the telephone number instead of the recipient's address. For example, the telephone number in my office is 11130, so telegrams sent to me from various places can also be written as "TELEPHONE 11130 Shanghai = Zhang Jiayu." After receiving this telegram, the Shanghai Telegraph Office will first find out the address of the telephone subscriber "11130" from the telephone directory, and then deliver it to the address. However, if the sender hopes that after this telegram arrives in Shanghai, the telegraph office will first transmit the content of the telegram to the recipient by telephone, and then have the messenger deliver the telegram, just add a =TF= (telephone delivery) identification before the telephone number and the recipient's name, and the telegraph office can do so.</p>
<p>In addition to the eleven special services mentioned above, there is also a "Postal Delivery" special service, but it does not apply to domestic telegrams, so I will not discuss it here. (End of Lecture 3)</p>
<h3>Reward for Reporting Secret Radio Stations</h3>
<p>— Yong</p>
<p>We recently saw news in the newspapers that the military and police authorities had cracked down on privately operated radio stations. The telecommunications bureau has indeed put a lot of thought into it. It has repeatedly stated that the organization of these privately operated radio stations is an act that undermines the country's transportation business and violates the transportation and telecommunications regulations, and should be severely punished by the national law. However, these people who disregard government laws and ignore commercial ethics are still doing it secretly, which is very regrettable.</p>
<p>In order to eliminate these privately operated radio stations that specialize in commercial telegrams, the telecommunications bureau has specially allocated a bonus to reward military and police authorities or individuals or organizations that report the radio stations. The telecommunications bureau guarantees to keep the name and address of the informant strictly confidential.</p>
<p>Thanks to the past cooperation of the military and police authorities in this city, the telecommunications authorities have been able to carry out this work smoothly. Undoubtedly, we must continue to work hard in the future to thoroughly eliminate these illegal privately operated radio stations, and the cooperation of people from all walks of life is the main factor in the success of this work.</p>
<h3>Reply to a Citizen of Caojing</h3>
<p>Thank you for reporting that Mr. Longshun Rice Shop, the operator of public telephone No. 67 in Caohejing, overcharged 15,000 yuan for each call! We have sent personnel to thoroughly investigate and found that Shengyuan Rice and Flower Factory, the operator of public telephone No. 69, also has the same situation. In accordance with the regulations, we have severely warned them separately and suspended telephone service for five days in rotation (No. 67 from March 16 to 20, No. 69 from March 11 to 15) to punish them. If there is any further overcharging, the machine will be dismantled. As for the reason for the overcharging stated in the letter, it involves the bureau's operators and field mechanics asking for monthly rules. After inquiring, the operators firmly denied it, or it was a misunderstanding and not a fact. Thank you for your assistance and friendship. We hope that you will continue to give us your opinions so that we can improve!</p>
