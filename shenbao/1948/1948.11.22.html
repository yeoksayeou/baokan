<p>〔本報訊〕昨日報載駐日盟軍統帥麥克阿瑟訪華之消息，記者曾向此間美國新聞處負責人探詢詳情，據告迄目前爲止，未聞有此消息，亦未聞麥帥有準備來華之意。又據此間某關係方面觀察，麥帥訪華之可能性極小，此訊可能係屬誤傳。</p>
<p>〔合衆社東京廿一日電〕東京廿一日晨盛傳麥克阿瑟元帥業已赴華或即將赴華之說，但顯無事實根據，此間盟總官員忙於答覆欲圖證實此項消息之人仕，華府方面國務院及陸軍部亦均稱毫無所聞。但亦無任何人能證實麥帥絕無赴華與蔣總統會商之可能。然渠決不致於以後數小時內赴華，蓋第一，渠必須於廿二日與此間盟國代表團首長檢定關於遠東國際軍事法庭對東條等廿五主要戰犯之判決，第二，駐華美國聯合軍事顧問團團長巴大維初抵日本，即使麥帥有意赴華，渠亦將先與巴大維會商。此間盛傳巴大維將軍離華來此，係與麥帥會商，並準備麥帥訪華之計劃。</p>
<p>〔又電〕此間美國高級官員認爲：中國之局勢已日漸明朗化，麥帥及其高級助理雖對中國局勢保持緘默，因中國不在麥帥之行政範圍以內，但麥帥無疑無時不在蒐集有關中國局勢發展之詳細情報。此間美國專家認爲指派麥帥或魏德邁將軍等著名美國軍事人物爲中國政府之最高軍事顧問，並批准充份之軍事援助—主要以軍火及設備輸運中國，以保證戰燒上之勝利。</p>

<h3 id="c25">同情中小學敎師 <a href="#c25" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e25" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">25</a></h3>
<p>幣制改革後的物價狂瀾，衝進社會階層的每一角落，而尤以教育界所受的威脅爲最嚴重。京滬各地中小學校教職員，因生活的煎迫，紛紛請求救濟而罷教了，情勢自然十分嚴重。上海市立中學以上的教職員，於十六日起全體總請假，市立小學教職員亦於十九日起全體韶請假，幸而上海經吳市長脣焦舌敝的勸導，巳允於今日復教，但願不再有什麼變化。私立中小學教師對當局的救濟和學校追加學費問題，未敢樂觀。聞也有總請假的趨勢。這是一樁很嚴重的社會問題，並且反映整個教育的危機，值得十分注意。政府當局和學校主管，如不急起挽救，無疑是萬分可憂的事。</p>
<p>中小學教師的生活，從來是淸苦的，尤其公立學校的教師，一向體諒國家的艱困，服從政府的法令規章，而安貧樂道，枵腹執教，堅守「教育第一」的神埾崗位，爲國家爲社會，教育第二代。雖然他們師生活不如工人，更遠不如商人；但是他們爲了神聖的責任，始終是忍耐着。此種忍耐的精神，巳發揮到極致了。最近由於幣制改革所發生的缺陷，物價如股繮之馬，瘋狂的不斷的奔騰，而尤以食米的上揚爲最巨。於是本來巳陷貧窮的教師們，更被迫走上飢餓的邊緣。京滬各地中小學教師，這决不約而同的總請假，在客觀上，當是爲了吃不飽而罷教，乃迫不獲已的一種措施。在我們的主觀上，因教師總請假而荒廢了學生餉學業，影響了教育的進度，不能不說是對學生對社會的一種損失。可是廣大的學生，目覩教師們一張飢餓的臉，他們不僅原諒教師們的行動，而且同情教師們的遭遇，支持教師們的立塲。何况總請假是一種暫時的，問題必需解决，並且需要很快的圓滿的解決。這一點，吳市長，潘議長，和各校校長以及教師，都有淸楚的認識；我們希望教師與政府在互諒之下而毅然復教。</p>
<p>解決中小學教師總請假問題，政府當局有責，社會輿論也有責。治本的辦法，是合理的建立教育人員的待遇制度，使之安心爲教育事業服務。治標的辦法，是救濟教育人員當前生活的困窘·上海市立小學教職員聯誼會廿日招待新聞記者說：戰前市小教職員薪金可買食米五石至十石，目前收入平均爲百四五十元，祗可購米二三斗，外加配米三斗合共五六斗，欲依之維持家人生活，甚感困難萬分。這一種窘狀，獅該是眞實的寫眞。他們要求政府有治本辦法，使戰前水準能與戰後情形一趨。當前治標的救濟辦法，中小學教師的要求是一致，他們希求能得食米一石麵粉二袋及金圓五百，以作緊急救濟。按照實際情形說來，他們自非過分的奢求。他們縱如理想而獲得上述的救濟，也並不能，高其生活水準。儘管政府當局也感於經費枯竭，應付爲難，但仍然希望能體諒他們的痛苦，酌情予以實際的可能的救濟，同時也盼望教師先行復教，恢復教育正常的秩序，然後再商治本的辦法。</p>
<p>社會輿論對於市立中小教師總請假，是萬分同情的；可是與此同時的若干私立中小學乘機伸手向學生補收學費，甚且以停課等待繳費之舉，是應該有所斟酌的。公立學校同私立學校的制度不同，收費標準不同，公立學校的困難不全爲私立學校所有，儘管公私立學校教師的生活同樣淸苦，而私立學校主管的財政管理和既得權益，在任何情形下也很遭受損失的。學校開學之時，物價在低潮階段，學生依學校規定所繳「本學期」的學費、其價值幷無變動。私立學校校長在開學時不按收支預算，預付教師薪金：而今無情的欲將貨幣的損失轉嫁於學生家長，在理論上絕無此理。教育局准許私立學校向家長追收「尊師金」或「教師福利金」，爲私立學校打開追加學費之門，在家境較優之家，本來也應有這種責任感，對於學校的困難應予援助；但在淸寒之家與公務人員家庭，對於這種出乎意外的負担，的確難于勝任。基於道義，基於良知，淸寒學生之家長，不接受私立學校追加的學費，宜無絲亳的愧作。這一點，希望教育當局和私立學校特別要認識淸楚，不可作硬性的規定，以免引起　會的紛擾</p>
<p>總之，今日整個的教育現狀，巳臨最沉重的危險階身，有責者不要放棄職司，應該堅定的負起責任來，迅速改善各級教師生活現狀，搶救教育危機，以渡過當前的難關。</p>

<p>〔本報北平廿日電〕胡適廿日下午三時在華北剿總講演國際現勢，其結論爲「和比戰難。苦撑待變」。胡氏論及和平問題時一段演辭爲：「要求和平不要性急，和比戰難，要難上千倍萬倍，而和中共談和平，根本是妄想」。渠並以馬歇爾爲例稱：罵歇爾是上决大戰民主國家的總參謀長，他戰勝了軸心的德。日，但來華經年，却不能使國共的和談成功。胡氏結論目前只有苦撑待變，所謂待變，不一定要爆發第三决世界大戰，我們只要對我們的生活方式（民生自由和平的生活方式）有信心，能撑住，那麼，半年一年後，大局不會沒有轉變，這個轉變，一定有利我們，在設到杜魯門當選對於大局的影嚮時，胡氏讀了一段杜魯門去年三月咨請國會援助希·土的咨文，相信杜氏一定可以援援希士的前例援華。他相信北平永遠不會丟，所以他回答外國記者說，北大一月兩月半年一年也不搬家。</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕此間靑年黨負責人士非正式發表對時局之看法，認爲恢復和談目前決無可能，因實現國內和平之先決條件，爲中共退出共產國際及放棄武力鬥爭，而欲望中共如此讓步，無異緣木求魚。反之，如以中共爲中心，而組成「聯合政府」，我國之命運，勢將與捷克·匈牙利無殊。目前唯一之希望，爲由國際間之協調，造成國內和平之基礎，並盼當局積繩實施民主，以掃除國內之困難。</p>

<p>〔中央社南京廿一日電〕社會部長谷正綱，昨晚在軍廣播電台，向前方將士作慰勞廣播，題爲「向前綫民族英雄致敬」，講詞如下：</p>
<p>徐州前綫和太原，察東，陝東各綫英勇戡亂的陸軍空軍將士們：</p>
<p>最近徐州的勝利，太原的堅守，察東和陝東的大捷，我們各綫的英勇將士，本着愛國家，愛民族的革命精神，和匪軍作堅苦的戰爭，殲滅了匪軍的主力，贏得了輝煌的戰果，尤其是這决徐州的會戰，安定了徐蚱京滬，鞏固了國本邦基，他的意義，更是非常的重大，這些偉大的勝利，使全國和世界都一致的認識我們國民革命軍，是始終以熱血來捍衛祖國，維護正義，而決不會爲暴力所屈服，更不會爲國際第五縱隊所威脅的。各位將士，這種偉大功勞，實爲全國國民所感戴，當然也是全世界維護正義的人士所讚佩，本人願藉這個播講的機會，向各位民族英雄將士們，表示最誠摯最祟高的敬意。</p>
<p>我們如要認識戡亂的意義，和各位將士犠牲奮鬥的價值，首先我們應當要了解這决戡亂戰爭的本質。共匪因受第三國際的指使，實行侵略中國的陰謀，遂於抗戰勝利以後，首先就搶佔東北，繼在各地竄擾，終而全面叛亂，一面又散佈喪心病狂的宣傳，說我們戡亂戰爭爲內亂，其實共匪的叛亂，乃是第三國際對中國的一種侵略戰爭，我們何所根據來設共匪的叛亂是侵略戰爭呢？就是因爲他危害了我們國家的領土生權，和危害了我們民族的獨立自由，就拿東北爲例來說罷，是共匪巷第三國際作掩護，來搶奪了我們的資源；是共匪巷赤色帝國主義作先鋒，來佔據我們的土地，現在東北巳成爲了赤色的僞滿洲國了，假如中國不幸，國家的政權一旦落在共匪的手裏，那未我們的國家，就要受着赤色帝國主義的統治，我們的國家，也就要變成了第二個外蒙古，所以我們戡亂的目的，是在保護國家領土主權的完整，和保護民族的獨立自由，換言之，我們的戡亂戰爭，就是一個反赤色侵略的民族戰爭，所以我們的戡亂，對外是抵抗侵略，對內是打倒漢奸，凡是爲戡亂戰爭而奮鬥的將士，都是我們最崇敬的民族英雄，我們希望前棧的各位將士們，應以過去爭取抗日戰爭勝利的精神，來爭取戡亂戰爭的勝利。</p>
<p>第三國際的陰謀，不僅在赤化中國，而且要赤化亞洲，更進而赤化世界，所以我們對戡平匪亂的努力，一方面應團結全國國民，爲保障國家民族獨立自由而戰爭，一方面應聯合世界上被第三國際陰謀危害的國家民族，爲反赤色帝國主義的侵略而奮鬥。第二次世界大戰，是世界上反侵略的國家，在聯合戰綫之下，而打倒了德·日。意法西斯的侵略，現在世界反侵略的戰綫已在形成，反侵略餉第三次世界大戰的序幕，也已在亞洲和東歐開始了，我們相信，最後餉勝利，必然是燒於爲保障國家民族生存獨立而審鬥的人們的。</p>
<p>根據我們以上所說的這些話，我們敢肯定的告訴各位，中國的奸匪集團，就是所謂的中國共產黨，在中國是決不會成功的，他們在中國的叛亂，終久必然要被戡平的，請各位看看世界的歷史，請各位看看近代的潮流，任何一個民族國家，爲了保衛祖國，抵抗直接間接的侵略而戰，沒有不獲得最後勝利與成功的，我們今天剿除奸匪，既然是一種反侵略的民族戰爭，所以最後必定成功我們抗日戰爭，曾經獲得光榮的勝利，因此戡亂剿匪的戰爭，也一定會獲得光榮的勝利，祗要各位認淸歷史，認淸潮流，堅定信心，加强奮鬥，全國最大多數的愛國同胞，全世界最大多數維護正義的人士，都是和諸位站在同一條綫上，決心作諸位後盾的，我們敢於保證，這一次的戡亂戰爭，必定可以成功。</p>

<p>— 石譯</p>
<p>蘇聯的政治內幕，到如今還沒有使全世界的人民很明瞭。因之對於史達林的權限問題·也就成了一個謎。有人設，史達林是蘇聯的眞正的統治者，而杜魯門總統却疑惑這個猜測，他認爲史達林是蘇聯行政局的俘虜。有人認爲蘇聯的行政策略，是取決於十三位蘇聯政治首腦所組織的行政局，但是也有人以爲蘇聯的行政策略是取決於軍事當局的。</p>
<p>因爲蘇聯的駐德軍事長官索柯洛夫斯基將軍曾經不遵行三國外交官和史達林在莫斯科簽定的條約，致有人誤認爲蘇聯的將領有遠抗史達林命令的權力。其實這是不可能的事。軍事當局不但不能管制史達林和行政局，並且軍事當局是要受行政局和史達林節制的。</p>
<p>史達絲在蘇聯國內的地位，是獨一無二的統治者；他現在是擁有二億人民和六百萬的蘇聯共產黨。蘇聯的獨裁者，乃是黨機構的產物。行政局是由十三位蘇聯政治首腦所組成，它並不是內閣，只不過是蘇聯共產黨中央委員會的一支脈而巳。但是蘇聯的國策，却是多半由於這個組織所決定的。</p>
<p>在去年舉行公共會議的時候，史達林元首的旁席，我們常常可以發現外長莫洛托夫，和共產黨秘書長日丹諾夫和伏羅希洛夫將軍和他並肩而坐。自從今歲日丹諾夫逝世之後，在每决集會上，史達林元首的旁邊就多了二位新人物，那就是馬尼柯夫與貝利亞。這是很明顯的，史達林元首最親信的人物是誰？我們便可以從集會照片上一目瞭然。</p>
<p>在行政局裏，除了史達林元首之外，有三位人物是比較最有權威，那就是莫洛托夫。馬尼柯夫和貝利亞。這三位人物，有人是稱之爲「三人小組」的。</p>
<p>莫洛托夫是蘇聯的外長，是在西方外交官心目中最熟知的人物。他是史達林的老友，並且也是與史達林共事有三十五年之久的老同僚。</p>
<p>罵尼柯夫是行政勝委負之一，以前是史達林的私人秘書，今年四十五歲。他的記憶力特別强，雖然他至今還沒有出過國，但是因爲他曾經任過戰時蘇聯重工業委員會主席，所以他對於歐。亞。美三大洲的工業概况非常明瞭。</p>
<p>貝利亞，是蘇聯二十師秘密警察的統領和蘇聯監獄營主任。他靠了他的組織，他的勢力不但普及全國，並且擴充到蘇聯的各衛星國及其他各地。</p>
<p>所謂行政局的「三人小組」—史達林的親信人物，並不是固定不　的。換一句話設，史達林爲了要試騐行政局各委員的才幹，行政局的十三位委員都有被目爲親信人物的可能。上面所述的三位人物，乃是目前史達林心目中的親信人物。</p>
<p>行政局的會議和活動，是十分神秘的。那十生位行政局的委員也常常住在克林姆宮而不常外出的。蘇聯共產黨的高級黨員和專門人才，有些時候也被宣召入宮參加行政局會議發表意見的，但是這不渦是偶然的事而已。</p>
<p>行政局登員都是　了自己的才幹而被擢升起來的，在未進行政局之前，他們曾一再受過試騐，同時也都是被秘密警察切實地監視和審查過的。他們都是史達林的信徒，在行政局會議的時候，這十三位委員並非都是史達林的「應聲虫」，他們都有自由發言權。不但可以批評國策，共產黨的政策和其他，並且有時也可以鉀論史達林的建議。凡是討論一件事，十三位委員都可以暢所欲言，如果爭論相持不下，往往由史達林元首作最後決定。到那時候，對於這件事的討論就可告一段落，雖然你對於這件事的決定不十分滿意，但是你也得犧牲了自我的主見，去推行　政治　策</p>
<p>行政局的決策是不會沒有錯誤的，但是一發現有錯誤，即行開會變更策略·行政局餉委員們並不像低級黨員一樣，需熟讀利寗的遺訓，他們都是現實主義者。史達林已近七十歲了，他的繼承人是誰呢？這是可能由上述的「三小組」來代行職權的，但是直接由罵尼柯夫來繼承也很可能。蘇聯行政局的十三位首長名單如次：史達林，莫洛托夫，馬尼柯夫，貝利亞，伏羅希洛夫，米高揚，安特萊葉夫，卡岡諾維基，克羅契夫，伏尼森斯基，希維尼基，布加寗，柯西金。（譯自「美國新聞與世界報告」十月號）</p>
<h3 id="c61">對解決巴勒斯坦問題　我代表闡明立塲　全力支持貝那多特計劃 <a href="#c61" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e61" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">61</a></h3>
<p>〔中央社巴黎二十日電〕我國出席聯大代表劉錯今日在聯大政委會中發表演說，表明我國對於巴勒斯坦問題之立塲如次：（一）中國支持已故聯合國巴勒斯坦調人貝那多特之十一點結論，此項結論最近又經代理調人彭契重行提出。（二）中國支持英國之新建議，即主張設立巴勒斯坦「和解委會」。（三）中國反對以武力造成之「既成事實」。（四）中國支持幾近五十萬阿拉伯難民早日返回巴勒斯坦之原來住所。劉氏指出中國在去年十一月間表決分（二）計劃時，雖放棄投票，目前之巴勒斯坦則已呈現一種新情勢，需要在和解方面重作努力。劉氏並讚揚貝那多特之結論稱，此種結論乃「完全客觀者，且大致公平無私」。如貝氏之報告能作爲解決之基礎，則整個領土之劃定問題，均可交託和解委會解決，傳該委會能致力於求取猶阿雙方之協議。劉錯之結論稱，「吾人希望和解委會與阿猶當局，能於來年將現行之休戰及停戰狀態，轉變爲永久和平，在聖地中心建立友愛之新聖殿」。</p>
<p>〔聯合社巴黎二十日電〕當政委會辯論之初，英國要求聯大通過貝那多特建議，包括猶太放棄南部尼基夫一項在內，依此建議，以色列領土將縮小百分之六十左右。美國贊同貝那多特之其他建議，但支持以色列要求維特原來方案。美代表傑傑普稱，美國雖反對將尼基夫割讓阿拉伯，認爲以色列鎮土非經猶太人完全同意不能削减，但亦認爲應當繼續尋求雙方成立協議之法，勿在此時劃分特殊界綫。</p>

<p>零星援助，不足改善中國目前局勢；惟有予中國更大接濟，始能阻止共黨進展。</p>
<p>〔美國新聞處華盛頓廿日電〕據參院委員代表團今公佈之報告稱：美國如欲遏阻中共之進展，須予中國以更多之經濟與軍事援助。此一報告由參院撥款委員會顧問前任參議員克拉克所擬具，內容概述一般認爲挽救中國所必需之五點計劃如下：（一）立即以大砲·飛機與子彈實行廣泛之軍事援助。（二）戰鬥上顧問性質之援助。（三）經濟援助之數量足以抵消中國國內預算中大部份之戰費。（四）穩定中國幣制之經濟援助。（五）美國嚴格監督在任何中美貸款協定下之一切支出。該報告並力言：「零碎之援助」不能挽救中國免於淪入共黨之手，並稱：「目前非全盤計劃不可。」克拉克代表團曾於本年十月由第八十屆國會參院撥款委員會主席參議員勃里奇派往中國。勃里奇始終主張美國增加援華。渠最近鑒於中國危急之局勢，曾建議召開國會特別會議，以便討論此種援助。但杜魯門總統最近在記者招待會中稱：國會特別會議將不予召開，任何增加援華之舉，必須在明年一月所召開之八十一屆國會中，加以考慮。勃里奇爲共和黨黨員，在民主黨佔多數之新參院中，將不復担任撥款委員會之主席。克拉克之報告包括中國社會·經濟·金融之軍事需要，而稱此等需要係屬「完全不可分開者」。該報告稱，此項報告係根據多量之報告與統計材料，並根據與美國駐華官員以及與政府·商界·銀行界與民間領袖商討所獲之結果，彙編而成者。該報告在建議廣泛之軍事援助時，曾指出中國方面，「岌岌可危之供應情形」，並指出中國方面摩托車運輸工具之迅速惡化，以及在戰爭結束時加以接收之日本與美國供應品之即將涸竭，「僅有之臨時援助」即爲經中國行政院物資供應局所獲得之美國剩餘物資。該報告復指出中國「岌岌可危之金融局勢」，係由於美國國會於本年核准之一二五·〇〇〇·〇〇〇美元援助，交付遲緩，而此項援助係由中國政府規定作爲採購軍用供應品之用者。該報舍概括論明目前之局勢爲「一切供應品迅速涸竭之局勢」，除極有限之補充外，並無其他補充之希望已現於目前。該報告又謂，「惟有增加美國之顧問權力，始能補救此等軍事上之缺陷」，而美國軍事參謀人員之意見，可能「消除不智之戰略，或可使勝利代巷失敗」。關於穩定中國經濟問題，該報告提出一項包含三點之計劃：該報告謂，大量之有效軍事援助，在任何金融計劃中務必首先予以考慮，良以「除非使戰爭所引起之收支不平衡不再存在，賞無使中國通貨或其經濟情形趨於穩定之可能」。報告稱：如能平衡預算。美國即可藉對華美金貸款，恢復中國幣制信用，該項貸款係作穩定準備之用，爲期五年，可予廷期。貸款不得少於二億美元。此項金準備應由美國保管，其用途僅限於作通貨之準備金。穩定計劃之第三點，爲十年至二十年之建設貸款計劃，業已設立之工業尚須全部或一部重建者，可優先享受此項貸款。報告列舉此種種財政措施之利益，認爲「戰爭支出一旦中止，中國即可居於有利地位，平衡預算，穩定通貨之阻碍即可消除。通貨既獲廣泛信任，自能刺激各種努力，再配合以對工業重建之財政援助，則中國復興所必須之生產及輸入之增加不難達到。」報告中繼指出自由與復興之中國，對世界經濟所能作之貢獻。中國之輸入需要對世界其他部份頗爲重要。其輸出現雖因政府之「凍結」及幣制更改而大量减少，但其中大部份皆爲他國所需要之物品，此種物資且無法自他處取得，」報告最後略述其五項基本建議，承認此項援助計劃「澈底而範圍廣泛。」結論稱：自擬定計劃者看來，「任何遜於此計劃之行動，皆不能完成此一工作。」（完）</p>

<p>謎樣的太原城  本報記者　郭忠恕　　〔本報太原十二日航訊〕在華北局勢急劇惡化的今日，太原會戰已引起了全國人的重視，甚至於成了一個不解之謎，太原的兵力環境，不但比不上瀋陽。錦州·或濟南，就是被困七八個月的長春的環境，也遠非太原所能比得上。長春有兩個新式武器的勁軍，完全孤立，也尚未及一年，太原對外陸路交通之被匪截斷，却巳是兩年以前的事了，在剿匪戰〔序列上，雁關以北之大同區，歸傳作義將軍管轄，韓候嶺以南之臨汾運城區，內胡宗南將軍指揮，太原綏靖公署管區的區域，僅爲北起忻縣，南達介休的狹長地帶，形成了一個「赤海孤島」，　　晋中會戰　　今夏六·七·八三個月間晋中會戰，太原市區以外所有的縣區，散失至盡，而且太原市區，已成了一個不完整的孤島。九月八日克復了城西汾河西岸山岳邊緣之神堂溝冶峪以後，太原城的威脅才告解除，城週北面保有達黃寨鎮之六十里，東面與匪相持於陽曲壽陽交界距城三四十里地區，西及南市區冶峪董茹舊南機塲以南距城二十里地帶以南以西，已爲匪所盤據之區域，人力物力之缺乏程度如何，不難想像得知的，尤其在軍民的食糧，祗靠空運來補充。說到兵力，三年前光復以來，除當時第二戰區的部隊以外，從未得到政府一兵一卒的增添，而尚把一個師犧牲在臨汾，一個師截至現在，仍戍守於大同，但以番號和負額說起來，還不能設是太少，應知其係以抗日敝疲之師，二十四年冬晋東南長治大會戰，幾係與當時共匪之全力爲戰，與彭德懷。劉伯承角鬥，約損失全部實力三分之二。爾後即在補充中戰鬥，亦即係於漫長年月中在戰鬥中謀補充。今春汾陽孝義區匪我兩敗俱傷之主力決鬥後，國軍以此間晋中會戰之損失最爲慘重，於是官兵不得不一致向朝野大聲求援，所到空運援軍亦不過不足一個師之微。近日太原攻防戰緊急情况中，所到空運援軍，更極有限。　　援匪不絕　　我們知道匪衆早達廿餘萬，爲國軍斃傷的也已達到九萬多的驚人數目，但匪是可以不斷裏脅民衆塡砲眼，換子彈，更可以隨時由四方入面調到援匪的。我們可以肯定的說，在人力物力雙方，國軍是處於絕對劣勢的，本來去秋大同之戰，在四十五日之後，兇匪終告潰敗，忻縣也是在四五十日之後，匪告敗北。一個小小應縣，卒能堅拒，未爲匪拔，臨汾是苦撑了七十五日之後，才告失陷的，以太原之重要，而且在太原綏靖區最高統帥直接指揮之下，戰果如何，原不以爲奇異，但因在此一面倒之華北驚潮中，以孤危最久，力量異常薄弱之太原，竟能不爲此潮波所影響，卽截至今日而論，已算獨能表現卓越戰績，揚國威，壯士氣，振民心，有功於國，已足稱道，也無怪能獲得舉國之重親與驚奇了。太原的剿匪工作，因意志堅定，認識深刻，局勢無論怎樣岌岌，人民總是堅定如恒。　　肅僞工作　　太原的肅偽工作，是部隊做到兵柵，人民做到閭鄰的，共黨僞裝，雖不能說一個也沒有，但有了是很不容易始終藏匿的，自淸自衛自治的「三日工作」，做得非常澈底，這一次吳化文弟二的黃樵松之事先即被發覺，國然是由於他的部屬的明大義，知廉恥，予以舉發，可是閻錫山氏之對三十師，也是竭盡了預防之常道的，閻氏對該部一本優渥，有求必予，不求亦予，所以黃樵松一個人是叛變不成的，第三是軍政經教的一元化，外人謂山西爲特殊，有之則係軍政經教的一元化，惟其一元化，才紹於總體戰的實施。　　工廠機塲　晋　當局在經濟方面，幾十個輕重工業大規模工廠，不惟無一烟囪不在照常冒着烟，而數萬員工也不但不鬆怠，反而是在砲火下加緊製造，除供給軍用與人民日常生活必需品外，還有餘力作對外輸出，大宗的鋼鐵等品，仍照常凌空向外輸送的。空運早巳成了太原唯一的呼吸器，原先築有南北兩機塲，在晋中會戰期間，又趕築成城南五里之新南機塲，太原曾戰爆發後，又在東門外趕築靠城新機塲，戰局的演變，使此四個機塲全失了效，却又在城西築成新機塲，這個機塲，正在爲太原軍民供吐納效用，這又是一太原軍民信心堅定，總體戰效力表現於事實的明證。　　碉堡繁多　　第四是碉堡繁多，工事堅固，有人認爲調堡工事是靜的，作戰是動的，此種見解，當不無部份理由，但在守點上，尤其是軍略政略上必守的城市，碉堡工事，仍有其不可忽視的價值。太原城甫城北陣綫之能以穩定，城東及其南北兩　山岳地區之進出有所依據，主力鏖戰已達月餘之久，匪軍死傷八九萬衆，可以說不少的功績，是應歸之於這密如繁星的鋼骨水泥的大小碉堡羣的。有了上述這些優點，加上閣錫山氏「葬在太原」的決心，所以才能有了太原今日之異於其他各大都市的優異抗匪戰績，但共匪對於太原是有必拔的決心的。早有傳聞，共匪們準備以太原做「首都」，並擬在太原召開所謂「新政協」，將以可能利用的軍力，民力，財力，攻略太原，而太原國軍的軍力，民力，財力，即使用盡，也是有限的，如何增援兵力，接濟物資，已爲刻不容緩的急務了，否則雖存心加援，也曾有過遲之感的。塞外綠洲張家口  本報記者越展　　〔本報北平十七日航訊〕在北平西山正看紅葉，到張家口巳見河水流冰了。　　第一個印象總是陌生的，但很容易看出，這是個富有朝氣的都市。在他們的生活態度上，可以看出對工作的認眞，人生對他們是一個很嚴肅的問題，他們不容易激動，也不愛浮華。女人似乎不知口紅爲何物，公務員都是一身棉布衣服，穿一襲油膩老羊皮的商人便算是闊綽了，沒有人好意思坐汽車到影戲院門口。如此樸素的都市確是少見，穿西服大衣的人，到這裏來，總不十分自在。　　馳名遐邇的蔴菇　　這種樸素的作風可設是「土產」，如馳名遐邇的蔴菇一樣。蔴菇這東西出了南口，便算是一種難得的美味，在本地並不怎樣了不起。張家口的蔴菇銷行全國，盡人皆知，此物產於察北及內蒙，目前察北及內蒙騷亂不已，一切毛皮及牲畜和食糧的來源都斷絕了，唯有此味繼續能來，原因是携帶方便，又非生活必需品。張家口蔴菇店，多至卅餘家，最好的蔴菇賣四十八圓一斤，最决十元一斤，今年的銷路不佳。　　大境門不勝滄桑　　張家口的發展是以與外蒙貿易爲背景，它有過黃金時代，目前是蕭條了。將來怎樣，不敢預測。歷史上有名的蒙漢貿易地點在大境門，是在張垣上埠地方，現在已成了古跡。往昔蒙古人牽來牛羊駱駝，換去棉布烟茶。現在，蒙古難胞一批批地由此門進來，偶爾有一隻駱駝走進大境門，用憂愁的小眼睛望望「大好河山」四個大字，以及兩旁伸展着的古長城，上有烽火台廢墟，一定不勝滄桑之感。　　現在逃來張垣的蒙古難胞，數達八百餘人，多數是赤貧，全部都需要救濟。另外，還有二千餘人分散在張北各縣，烏珠穆沁右旂十四歲的小王爺米卓德章農布寗布，最近也逃到張垣，已於本月十日轉往北平，這位小米王很嗜京戲。　　文化上的解放脚　　張家口的文化有點像「解放脚」，在形式內容方面總擺脫不了本來面目，評劇在張家口最受歡迎，傳作義先生回張垣來時，也喜歡和他的老同志們去聽戲文。張家口的奮鬥新村，奮鬥中學，是傳先生部下的眷慶住宅和子女學校，有社會主義的色彩，家族主義的精神。張家口的報紙，有奮鬥日報，民生報，商業日報，察哈爾日報四種，共銷五千六百份。張垣有十七萬人口，平均卅個人有一份報紙。張家口的文化雖然患着貧血症，但在塞外邊荒地方，還不失爲沙漢中的綠洲。　　數字觀念的都市　　張垣是一個有數字觀念的都市，警察局長陰燕英先生，如數家珍一般地告訴我許多事情，有多少人口，多少行業，人民有多少動產，多少不動產，在警察局的兩間小房中，有關於一切人的事的統計數字，精細無遺，有一張圖表上表明出：兩百名妓女，百分之九十是健康的。　　一件小事，可以設明張垣的組織精神的完密·我一下車，最關心我的是警察，他們問我打算住在什麼地方，登記之後，晚間便有憲兵來拜訪我了。蘇省派員督微田賦稻榖獲准由蕪啓運　　〔本報鎮江十九日訊〕蘇省各縣田賦徵實，均已先後啓徵，省田糧處爲加强督導，三個月內如限完成，特派該處督導員吳益三·汪志道等六人，分赴松·蘇·錫·常等縣督徵。吳等均於十九日由鎭分別出發。　　〔又訊〕鎭·錫·常·通等縣在蕪湖採購之稻　五萬石，糧部電復蘇省田糧處，已電皖省府及第八綵靖區准予啓運，該批稻　日內即可運到。　　〔又訊〕據民政廳消息；蘇省江南各縣禁烟工作，今年度係以查緝爲中心，務於本年年底烟毒全部肅淸。張坦大境門邊之古長城一角·上有烽火台遺址（東北新聞攝影社張文僯攝）白蓮敎餘傳播一貫道　　川南破獲巨案　　〔本報成都廿日航訊〕川南五通橋近破獲一大規模組織之一貫敎，　月前有河北人常振中·高賀光·由北平入川，在全川各地廣設教壇，招致靑年男女及無業流民入敎。輾轉至五通橋，藉經營明德商號，高一貫敎，宗旨僞託電振三綱五常，誘騙青年入敎，儀式　秘，男女均須裸體宣誓，並繳納鉅額會費。一時無知男女及無業流氓，受其　惑，趨之若驚。上月警局中·高賀光·田智「教首」常振中·高賀光。田智等三人，搜出「一貫道脈圖解」及有關文件多種，經解專署嚴密偵訊，發現該教純襲白蓮教餘緒，並有煽動反戡亂嫌疑之標語，及種種怪異符號。該教在各地成立分會，且有北平專人乘機前來指導，足見其組織之龐大。現該專署以案情重大，除再詳密偵訊外，並呈報川省府核辦。袖珍新聞　　嘉興　　〔本報訊〕本縣田糧處以十一月份酊額軍糧八千大包，部省迭令緊催，須在月底繳淸，爲謀及時完成起見，連日動員公教人員及縣級軍警協助全面催徵，並定二十日成立田賦督擻團，各鄉鎮亦限期成立督徵隊，以赴事功。　　吳興　　〔本報訊〕本縣康靜等七鄉鎭，於入秋後雷雨成災，低田淹沒，經縣府派員查勘計康靜，東林，含山，升南，溪西，千金，金城等七鄉鎮災田面積一五五二六畝一分四厘七，應免賦額四三一五元，已呈報省府備查。　　海寗　　〔本報訊〕本縣蠶絲業務，已漸趨復興，縣蠶聯合社已決定自廿日起。出定三十八年度春蠶種，每張白米一斗二升，優待社員，得按市價折金圓計算，價格如下：雲南種每張二十八元，三胡蘆每張二十五元，中蠶牌每張廿五元，此後按市價隨時調整。又訊：縣府冬防會議決定，全縣組四冬防大隊部，加强自衛。　　松江　　〔本報訊〕本縣應征卅七年賦穀，巳於本月一日開征，但民間征收冬租，須俟農歷冬至前滿限，故爲加緊征解計，巳由縣田糧處改變計劃，先向農佃每畝借征糙米二斗，憑此收據抵繳冬租，其餘不足零數，仍由業戶憑通知單完繳，刻已責成各岡催征員展開催收工作。　　嘉定　　〔本報訊〕本縣各鄉鎭中心校及保校教職員，邇因物價飛騰，無法維持生活，爰於十八日中午，聯名向縣府呼籲，要求當局緊急救濟，當由周縣長令飭各鄉鎮長向富戶商借食糧，按月發給公糧，各代表深表滿意。　　六合　　〔本報訊〕新　鎭鎮代表顧實榮，有通匪嫌疑，已被憲兵隊捕獲究辦。又：童德炳·童如方·父子二人，亦因通匪嫌疑被捕。又訊：城區罷教教師，十六日繩參議會再三援助，始獲當局圓滿答覆，男女教師已於十七日晨正式復教。　　句容　　〔本報訊〕縣府爲安定公教人員生計，增加工作效率，特呈准層峯，每一公教人員在補發九，十，兩月份生補費項下，各以「八一九」限價（二十金圓）酊售中熟米一石。其十一月份縣中央規定加成外，並以優待市價（七十金圓），每人酊售公糧稻一石，折合糙米五斗，已於十七日開始發放。　　成都　　〔本報訊〕川省府爲發展川主要外銷特產桐油生產，頃特約川實業人士，組四川桐油協進會，推廣種植榨煉運銷出口業務。計劃第一步以長江流域宜賓·合江·巴縣·長壽·奉節等縣爲推廣示範區·第二步推廣嘉陵江流域，並在遂寗·瀘縣·涪陵·重慶·萬縣五地設立大規模苗圃。同時，請政府舉辦桐油貸款，利用科學新式方法改良運輸壓榨，組織研究會，研究桐油成品製造改良。關麟徵談　徐幷戰局　　〔本報成都十八日航訊〕徐州大捷，舉世騰歡，在軍校，陸軍副總司令關麟徵以極愉快語調，與記者暢談當前戰局。關氏首稱：關於徐州會戰，匪軍於攻陷濟南後，未經整補，遽爾糾集殘部，妄岡進犯，在戰略上，已犯急性病過失，必召敗亡，毫無疑義。國軍在徐州力食强大，戰鬥力堅　，決非陳毅劉伯承烏合之衆所能抗衡。且徐州古戰塲，廣大平坦，極宜機械化部隊活動，國軍選擇此有利地帶，以强大陸空軍配合裝甲部隊，以秋風掃落葉之勢，掃蕩匪部摧毀其主力，故能使此古戰塲變成敵軍墳墓，完成最光榮最偉大的戰果，其意義表現在戡亂史上特別重大。　　其决，關氏評太原保衛戰及華北運動戰，對閻百川傳宜生兩將軍習鬥精神，深致敬佩。據稱：太原保衛戰已歷六週，以閻將軍堅苦奮戰的精神，配合兵盛合一政策，完備工業基礎，兵員補充，武器供應，亳無問題，所以能發揮高度戰鬥力量。至於傅將軍在華北的運　　，軍民一致在愛國衛民的信念下，打硬仗，拼死命，戰法高明，世界軍學家早有榮譽評論，渠對兩氏實懷有萬分欽佩。　　最後關氏指出：戡亂戰爭在今日已進入最緊要階段，徐蚌大戰國軍擁有强大兵力，憑籍優越地形，運用靈活指揮，再加以將士用命，全部殲滅匪軍主力，決非難事。但欲克盡戡亂全功，必需全國人民上下一心，萬衆一力，實行總體戰。尤其要切記要拼命才能保命，拼產才能保產，因此擁有鉅資的毫門權貫，應該趕快覺司，貢獻一切，協助政府，完成戡亂，確保太平。中國的銅  秦浩　　從那裏來·往何處去　　調查統計的工作是近年始爲中國工商界所注意的，但即使注意，眞正的工作也並沒有普遍地努力展開。現在如果有人問：中國共有多少電廠？總共發電若干瓩？恐怕也沒有人能答覆，甚至極少資料可以參考。這對於工商業本身的發展，確也有着極大的阻礙。筆者因爲職務關係，對輕金屬和一般特殊金屬在業務範圍內接觸的機會較多，兩年來很感覺到沒有統計資料可供參考的不便，因此鼓勵了幾位同事一起合作，稍微做了一些調查工作。本年四月初，寫成「上海區銅製品產銷實况」一文，曾利於本報。　在本文開始以前，還得聲明一點：即我國國防工業所需要的銅，如何取得及每月需要量約有若干等，均未包括在本文以內。　　銅從那裏來？（甲）國外輸入　　銅在我國雖有相當的產量，但是離開實際需要量尚遠，故仍有一部份須仰給國外。目前要向國外訂購銅品，其過程甚爲複雜，須先向輸出入管理委員會申請，經核准後須再取得外匯，然後纔能够正式辦理訂購手續。華北，華中，華南，以及台灣方面都是如此。以上海而論，稱得上大規模經營銅業的主體祗有兩個，一是「上海市銅鍚商業同業公會」，另一是「上海市銅料工業同業公會」。前者所屬會員的業務是販賣，後者所屬會員的業務是加工及生產製造；而其中祗有銅料工業同業公會可以獲得官價外匯，可以直接向国外訂購銅料。　　至於銅錫商業同業公會各會員所需原料，則大都仰賴於市上存貨及廢銅之複煉，尤其是各體關如物資供應局，及以前的行總等等所大量出售的機器零件，及其他各種廢銅製品，均先由該業集資承購，然後再分門別類，按照各會員的需要，予以分配。在必需國外原料時，則委託獲有官價外匯的進出口商代爲訂購。　　關於銅的第五季外匯配額如下：（一）紫銅銅料業獲一九二，四九四，四四元。（二）黃銅銅料業獲五二，七三八，〇七元，進出口商獲二四，八一七，九二元，共合美金七七，五五五，九九元。此外還可以加上一部份由聯總救濟物資及日本賠償物資內所撥讓的，數量也不太少。　　茲再將三十七年一月至六月間輸入銅品數量及價値分列如下：　　（一）黃銅片及黃銅板三十七年上半年共進口五〇六公擔，時值法幣五，八一一，三二九，〇〇〇元，惟較之三十六年同期之輸入數量，已减少四分之三。這批黃銅大都來自香港，美國，和加拿大，銷納於上海，廣州，九龍和天津各處。　　（二）未列名黃銅共進口二三，七一二公擔，時值法幣一八九，四三九，二七四，〇〇〇元，泰半來自香港，决爲美國，英國，比利時和新加坡，去路以華中方面最廣，决爲華北及華南。本年上牛年進口量較去年同期大約增加百分之五十，所以增加的原因可能是一般廠商鑒於國內鋅價過昂，如仍照過去方法運入紫銅，再加鋅煉製黃銅，不如直接訂購黃銅反較合算。　　（三）紫銅片紫銅板進口數量爲一，八八五公擔，時值國幣三二，二二三，一三九，〇〇〇元，多數來自美國，約佔總量百分之六十五，去路差不多都在上海。　　（四）紫銅絲進口量爲三二，六六六公擔，時值二七四，九〇五，五九二，〇〇〇元，較去年同期進口量激增達八倍之鉅，原因是需要的增加。　　（五）未列名紫銅進口量爲九，四六六公擔，時值法幣一八四，一七五，一九四，〇〇〇元，來源爲美國，英國及香港，大部份也是銷在上海的。　　（六）紫銅錠紫銅塊（包括鎔化之舊紫銅在內）此項原料在紫銅類進口額中僅略决於紫銅絲，本年上半年共進口一四·三五七公擔，時值法幣一四七，五二七，四〇八，〇〇〇元，來源方面美國佔第一位，達一三，二三一，公擔，决爲英國及香港。　　綜計三十七年一月至六月，黃銅類進口總量爲二四，上一八公擔，紫銅類進口總量爲五八，三七四公擔，時值合共法幣八三四，〇八一，九三六，〇〇〇元，爲數眞是相當可觀了。這裏還有一點是值得我們猛省的：就是所輸入的紫銅絲之中，竟有日本貨在內，日本係一戰敗國，戰時國內工業損害茶烈，但曾幾何時，居然已有銅品可供出口，爭取所謂國外市堪了，對於我們，委實是一個强烈的諷刺。　　（乙）國內生產　　國內的銅礦在資源委員會未成立以前，開發量是微不足道的，（以前政府鑄造銅幣，其原料多半係向日本輸入），現在尚可考聲的祗有雲南方面的若干始終用土法開產的銅礦，其產品即我們上一代的老人所贊不絕口的雲南白銅（又稱「自然銅」）。　　現在要談國內的銅產，確不能不歸功於資源委員會，惟有在它成立以後，中國的銅鑛才大規模地用新式的方法被開採起來。資委會所屬各單位中產銅的有三個：　　（一）東北金屬鑛業公司　　東北金屬鑛業公司是接收敵人在東北所經營的一切金屬鑛而成立的，金銀銅鉛鋅鉬鎂無所不有，可是受了時局影嚮，眞正接收而經利用的祗有一所瀋陽冶煉廠·廠內設備已破壞不少，經努力修復，乃於三十六年二月復工，開始製煉電解銅，成績相當好，生產量最高時每月可產組銅一百二十噸，電銅九十噸以上；可惜一年半來因環境艱苦，電力供應不足，因此工作常常中斷。現在當然是更不能談了！　　該公司所產的電解銅，紫銅皮，黃銅皮，黃銅棒等，成份都很高，在市塲上備受歡迎；少其是電銅一項，其成份堪與著名的加拿大T字紫銅相匹敵，而售價則遠較便宜。但自太年十月中起，已受交通影嚮，無法運至關內，生產量也就跟着减少，每月約產電解銅四十噸，全部售與當地兵工廠。　　（二）台灣金銅鑛務局　　台灣金銅鑛務局在台北其隆區金瓜石，前身是日太鑛業株式會社，三十五年五月，由資源委員曾接收，成立台灣銅鑛籌備處，從事整頓修繕，到三十七年一月，才改組爲資源委員會台灣金銅鑛務局。以規模而論，該鑛已不能算小，特別是選鑛設備，在遠束可居第一或第二位；所採鑛石全用架空索道和吊車運輸，當初規劃得是相當週密的。可惜鑛砂的成分太差，金砂每噸僅含純申金三公分，銅鑛砂每噸僅合純金千分之七，未免太貧薄一些。　　生產量方面，由於全體工作入負的努力，已能漸復舊觀。例如沉澱銅一項，在日人經營時代，年產乾量約二千四百噸（其中含銅約一千二百噸左右），資源委員會接收後，自三十五年七月開工，截至三十七年九月底止，在這兩年中間，共產沉澱銅乾量二，八六一，四九七公斤，其中含銅量約爲一，六七二，三九一公斤。粗銅係於三十六年四月份起開始起煉，至三十七年九月底止，共生產一，一六五，三五三，五公斤。精銅於三十七年一月開始煉製，至同年九月底止，共生產七四七，七一四·五公斤（其中包括陽極銅六一七，三一九公斤）·電解銅於三十七年四月間開始煉製，至同年九月底止，共產電積銅二三七，九四七·五公斤。目前每月生產量約計粗銅一三〇噸，陽極銅一〇五噸，電積銅七十到八十噸，成份亦都合乎標準。　　（三）滇北鑛務局　　滇北鑛務局是國內歷史最久的銅鑛，遠在明淸時代，已有出品問世，所製銅器，品質優良，冠於全國，當時曾作爲貢品，該鑛鑛砂含銅量特高，竟達百分之四十，比台灣銅鑛要高出五六百倍之多。　　在滿淸時代，有一位欽差大臣管着這個礦，民國成立後，一直是由雲南省政府主持經營的；到民國廿公年，才由資源委員會和滇省府合辦。但因設備過於陳舊簡陋，且值戰時，大量新式機械無法輸入，無從改進，不得已仍用土法開採，所以產量很少。而且礦區位置太偏僻，離昆明市約有一百五六十公哩，既無鐵路，又沒有良好的公路可以利用，器材運入和產品運出都十分困艱；煤也不够，全靠砍伐樹木以充燃料，因此始終未能大量開發。勝利以後，局內人員大部外調，本身改爲保管處，雖仍繼續採煉，但產量已比當時更减少了十分之二左右，現在每月僅產粗銅約十噸，成份爲百分之八十五至八十八，全部供給中央電工廠應用。此外尚有少量的鉛和鋅出產，但也不能運到東南一帶來銷售。最近資委會聞已擬有加强開發該礦的計劃，明年可能實現。　　（丙）廢銅　　銅在複煉時的損耗是最輕微的，比任何一種輕金屬爲少，因此廢銅的價值相當高，可以利用的量也相當多，除掉前文所述各機關標售的舊機器零件，舊船舶零件和其他各種舊的銅製品外，民間所藏廢銅量也大有可觀。中國的老百姓，特別是內地的老百姓，至今業停留在銅器時代中，一般中產階級，搜索家中所有，大概二三擔銅是不繩問題的；里巷中的舊貨擔所收到的銅器，往往也佔一大部份。上海方面，有一個「五金舊貨商業同業公會」，所屬會員達三百二十以上，其中至少有十分之四是專營買賣廢銅師，每年經他們之手而流入工業方面的銅料，約略佔計，也可以相當於粗銅一百五十噸左右。內地各省市尚不在內。　　銅往何處去？　　銅的去路在中國除國防工業外，比較上數量最大的甚硬幣的鑄造和交通器材的製造。自從民國十八年政府改革幣制，把大部份的硬幣一概廢棄以後，硬幣的鑄造差不多已經完全中止。最近八月十九日政府實施新經濟政策，才又規定恢復製造一分銅幣和五角銀幣，到目前爲止，雖僅短短三個多月，但中央造幣廠方面已因此而在市上大量購入紫銅，由資源委員會供給的先後已有六十冬噸，各商號供售的也有二三十噸，此外楊子建業公司聽說也拋售了一大批T字紫銅塊（加拿大貨）給他們，爲數達二百五十噸之鉅。現在一分銅幣雖已停止鑄造，但五角銀幣之中，在鑄造時也得加進百分之十五到二十的紫銅進去才行。且政府近又公佈將加鑄一元銀幣，五元金幣及十元金幣，道些金幣在鑄造時少不得也需要加一些銅，才能得到必需的硬度。所以今後銅的各種主要出路中，鑄造硬幣必佔其一。　　其次是交通器材的製造，特別是鐵路機車和客車，它們所需要的配件和零件等至少有十分之三是用銅製造的。在過去一年中，單是資源委員會方面，售與交通部材料司和各鐵路餉銅料已有一百四十噸强，其中組銅三十噸，精銅九噸，電解銅八十九噸，銅皮十一噸，銅棒二噸。至於他們自己在國外或國內收購的數字，至少還要大上一二倍。　　再其决那就得輪到國營民營各銅品製造廠了，可再分別列舉如下：　　（一）電工器材廠國營民營都有，他們的產品是銅皮，銅綫，電風扇，馬達等等。所需原料，除一部份係通過各地「銅料業同業公會」向政府取得外匯，分別從英美兩國購入外，同時亦不斷在國內搜購，其需要量較其他各種銅品製造廠均高，佔第一位。　　（二）翻砂廠這類工廠的業務是用模型澆製各種機械的雛型，再由機器廠加工琢磨，然後纔可應用。出品有軸承，考克，凡爾及水管，油管等附件。他們所用的主要原料也是紫銅，但近來因來源不暢，大部份便利用雜銅複製了，　　（三）軋銅廠他們的業務比較繁複，所用主要原料仍爲銅塊，先軋成銅板，銅皮，銅管，銅棒等，然後再加工製成各種用品，例如染織廠用的滾筒，車輛上的裝飾品，零星建築材料，電燈泡，銅帽，電力開關，香烟盒，打火機，手電筒，熟水瓶酊件，證章，文具，照相製版材料等皆是。　　（四）拉絲廠這是以熔製粗細銅絲爲專業的工廠，電綫就是他們的主要出品，不過有些同業也兼營機器零件。在銅的消耗量方面，除一般電工器材廠外，拉絲廠可佔第二位，而且他們所需用的銅的成份也最高。　　（五）銅錫字號這些商號是國內殘餘的舊手工業之一，他們大都設有小規模的作塲，出品全是日常家用器皿，如祭器，鐘鼎，香爐，蠟扞，面盆，銅壼，餐具，樂器等，每年的銷售量倒也相當龐大。惟因所製物品均屬普攝用具，所以對於原料—銅—的成份的高低並不注意，實際上他們是十九以廢銅作爲原料的。（完）社會服務申報讀者助學金核准名單　　下列諸生，原係向上海市獎學金統一審核委員會申請，茲經該會核准，商請本報讀者助學金撥付。除領款收據寄各校轉達外，特將名單公佈，希諸生注意爲荷！　　（生生助產）周琦，唐勝璐，黃秋英，馬毓芬，沈一冰，徐桂珍。（樹民中學）王秦生，虞哲貞。（市商會職校）林淑芝，汪秀鳳，高維民，王中孚，胡居祥，嚴迺明，王關珍，周黎君，黃秀琴，陳筱鶴，陳秀引，瞿永生，張榮耀。（浦江紡織）楊正屛，顧乃儒，王有晋，陳必和，朱道利，顧軼羣，王宗亞，王宗渝，倪庭寬，姜爲齊，王必善，范陽春，范爲生，王有爲，陳必安，陳球，王中立，倪安和。（華東職業）孫慶雲，陳澄，馬芬棣，吳俊，陳龍，

<p>自由談從「賣」想起  雷霆　　是一件人類的慘事，但在報紙上却成爲花邊新聞。無意中又給我發現了。　　所謂慘事，依然還是吃飯問題。所略不同的，這一回的主演者，是在中國並不太多的大學生。記住：是大學生！　　事實是這樣的：「武大，體專及華中大學三校學生自治會，定十八日在武昌漢陽門舉行「擴大交賣會」，拍賣書籍衣服等物，以維伙食。武大一學生並投函某報，願賣自身，以圖糊口。」（見本月十七日新聞報）　　只寥寥數十字的報道，巳經看出我們今日的靑年所遭遇的是一種什麼境遇。他們不但在精神上感覺痛苦，即物質上面也面臨到最困窘的環境了。稍爲肯把眼光離開現實一點的人，便能想象到我們將有一個怎樣的下一代。　　「交資會」而又加上「擴大」，足見他們過去早在零星的賣，個別的責，所賣的大概也不外書籍和衣服；「擴大」只不過是化零爲整，換了一種方法，其藉「以維伙食」的目標還是一樣的。大學生而竟窮，在目前的教育制度中，也是意中的事。因爲窮而賣出點什麼東西，也不算怎樣丟險或了不得。所堪注意的，是賣的東西，賣的時候。正在求學的大學生，爲着維持伙食，便不得不出賣書籍；正在寒風凜冽的隆冬中，爲着維持伙食，又不得不出賣衣服。這不但身處其境者不免有人間何世的感想，即稍有點人心的旁觀者也看有點凄其吧！　　因爲學生們在這種時期這種季節中，連書籍和衣服都「擴大」的拍賣了，這更說明了他們爲着要活，不但顧不到將來，甚至連現在也顧不到。否則他們爲着解決「飢」的問題，便忽略了同樣嚴重的「寒」的問題和「學」的問題嗎？如果既飢且寒而又無學，他們將來所獲致的該是一個怎樣的後果？想一想！　　基於他們連現在也顧不到的事實，便又使人同情於那位自願賣身，以圖糊口的某大學生了。對於這一點，有人認爲這只不過是出於幽默的一種行動，更不免有點自我宣傳的嫌疑。這當然不是全無深由。然而在歧途彷徨呼籲無門的現實之下，誰又敢担保這必然是一種矯情的造作？　　當然，在災黎遍地的現實環境之下，大學生們幸而還有書籍可賣，衣服可賣，即使更不幸，還有身體可賣。只要有承購者在，也算不了什麼大事。然而如果他們將來爲着實逼處此，更進一步地從出賣身體進而出賣靈魂（當然，只是設想），試想，我們的下一代，能容納這許多沒有靈魂的主人翁嗎！　　問題一觸到下一代，便令人不寒而慄。栽培下一代的工具，是教育。而今且一看我們教育界的現象。　　不久以前，我們看見過烟合流亡學生飢餓遊行的大隊伍。最近幾天，我們又耳聞或目覩市立中小學教職員的總請假，私立中小學第二决學雜費的增收。總請假是變相的怠教或罷教，二决增收學雄費是增加家長們的負担。打句官話：理應取締。然而公私學校的教職員們，他們不是超人，也不是蚯蚓。他們總不能讓自已空着肚子，甚至妻兒們也空着肚子，在教室裏喊。唱高調者，可以休矣。　　從學生到教師，從小學到大學，到處是一片啼飢號寒聲。現在已顧不到了，還說將來——還有什麼將來！　　想到這裏，大學生的賣書籍，賣衣服，賣身體，只不過是這悲劇中的一個挿曲而巳；等閑視之或加上花邊，均無不可。（十一·十七）鷓鴣天  夏瞿禪　　斷角初收月已低，殘螢欲墮水先知，百年能幾眠眞熟？一日成歸夢又非。宜噴笛，莫沾衣，回頭江柳又成圍；驚秋意緒無人會，數　橋南夜鵲飛。寄懷叔範餘姚  姚鵷雛　　廢壘寒潮怒未平，蕭蕭蘆竹縱秋聲，經行應自悲今日，莫但傾河弔晚明。順手牽羊  烟波　　前幾天一位朋友來訪，談起一樁怪事。他因事到西摩路去，從愛文義路電車站下來，一直往南走，走過小菜塲時，忽見許多人圍住了一位衣履考究的中年女人，一個菜販正指了她的臉大駡，她竟滿面羞慚，不敢還嘴。後來一問，才知道她原是住在菜塲附近的一個老主顧，她的家道不壞，也常常買鷄買鴨，然而却喜歡順手牽羊，有偷東西之癖，這一天就因爲偷了兩個鷄蛋，正放進菜籃時，却被發覺了。我的朋友說，論她的家境，買幾個鷄蛋當然不成問題，然而她竟冒險一偷，其動機恐怕還是爲了「冒險」可以產生一種刺激，換句話設，倒完全是「爲偷東西而偷東西」了。　　其實，這就是所謂「竊盜狂」（Kleptomania）的一個例子。可怪的是：在第二决大戰以後，竊盜狂的患者竟然大見增加。而專籍偷竊爲生的人們自然仍和戰前一樣的活躍，以致近來美國各大城市的商店裏，大都已經雇用了專門「看淸」的便衣女偵探，來負責監視那些意圖順手牽羊的客人。即使如此，鬧市的商店中貨物失竊的案子，仍舊至今每天平均要發生七起之多。　　據一個女偵探說，常常有些極有錢的女顧客，買一件價值數千美元的皮大衣毫無吝色，却偏喜歡在走出門時愉一只牙刷之類不值錢的小東西，這種事情節直已繩司空見慣，甚至有些商店的老板們吩咐偵探們不必干涉那些貪小便宜的客人。但是，如果那位客人竟然大胆偷起貴重的東西來，偵探却就要不客氣了。　　有一家百貨店裏的自來水筆常常會神秘地失踪，經理就叫一位女偵探暗中留意。她發現有一個靑年，常常來買筆，形跡可疑，却不看見他動手偷，所以不敢捉他。不想旁邊的一個小孩子却叫起來說：「大家看那個人呀！鋼筆飛進他的袖子裏去了！」那位偵探大步上前，果然人贓並獲，原來他的袖子裏有一根橡皮筋，橡皮筋的下端縛一只夾子，只要拉出來把筆夾牢，一放手，那支筆就一飛」到袖子裏去了。　　這些女偵探決不打扮得妖妖嬈嬈，而外表都極像普通的家庭主婦，所以在店裏行動方便，不受注目，而那些順手牽羊的顧客中，竟然有百分之七十都是女性，女偵探自然更見適宜了。　　而且有許多事情也祗有細心的女子才會發覺。聲如說，女偵探蓓蒂，某一天忽然發覺某一個而熟的女顧客的胸部突然比平日發達了許多，蓓蒂就不客氣的上前出示身份，請那位女客到密室裏走一遭，繪果却在「胸」部發現了一只茶杯，一只碟子，刀，叉，匙，好幾塊糖，鹽瓶，胡椒瓶—外加一大疊紙巾。那個女客說這是她自已的餐具，恫嚇着蓓蒂，說蓓蒂非法逮捕，應當賠償損失。蓓蒂却一聲不響，繼續搜查，結果在那個女子的裙子邊綠里，發現它縫着八十張當票！把當票一看，就明白那個女矛的確是積竊了。　　最近，另一位女偵探捉到了一個少女，那個少女偷了一件價值五十元的外套。那位女偵探把東西奪還之後，念她初犯，訓誡了她一頓就把她放走了。不想到了明天，那個少女居然又到店裏，大發雷霆，自己設並非竊賊，而是一位作家，偷東西原不過爲了搜集資料而已。那位女偵探覺得又氣又好笑，說，「早知如此，我倒不該放你走了，送你進警察局，讓你在牢監裏坐幾天，你的資料一定會增加不少罷？」電車郵筒  强　　在荷蘭阿姆斯特丹，心不在焉的丈夫再也不必因爲忘記寄掉他的妻子交給他的信件而惶恐自責了。阿姆斯特丹的電車都裝有郵筒，無論何時電車停下來，你都可以將信投進去。到了電車的最後一站，郵差自會將信收去。不祥的歌劇  曹國平　　一八四三年，歌劇「查利第六」的作者傑克斯·海立梵，在仙的作品於巴黎首决演奏後七年暴死了，人家以爲這是神鬼在作崇。此後，這歌劇曾在巴黎戲院中連續演上三晚，每晚當唱到「喔上帝，殺了他！」一句時，總有幾位觀衆在戲院中暴卒。因此，這本歌劇便絕對禁演了。直到一八五八年，法國拿破崙第三爲王詩，下令開禁准演。某日，拿破崙第三與王后同車往觀此歌劇，不料走到半路，他們的轎式馬車竟然被炸。雖然法王與后未曾罹難，但不少隨員却有的死亡，有的受重傷。拿破崙第三便重又下令禁演。直到今日，歌劇「查理第六」已無形泯滅了。覆轍  邱隅　　聽說政府已經準備二十二日起，就可實行兌給金銀了。本來金圓券如果能以自由兌換硬幣，那就是無上上好的貨幣，信用自然昭著，物價自然穩定，又那來的如許風波與痛苦？現在痛定思痛，如果讓中下層人民得以稍爲補償他們過去的損失，亡羊補牢，政府不難重新取得他們的擁護，這是無可疑的。　　然而歷觀過去措施失當的現象，不外幾種。一是章程法令，既不能涵蓋一切，又不能斬釘截鐵。其實一種政策定了之後，就應下決心作去，有害且不得不犧牲，何况於幾經研究，自然是有利無害呢？退一步設，縱使將來發現弊害，儘可隨時補充修正，不宜在立法之初，給人以游移閃爍的印象。二是舉止步驟之缺乏聯繫，例如上决物價已經發生波動，銅輔幣就早應中止發行，而執行的人還不能體察情形，變通辦理，以致大量銅幣落入囤積者之手。三是事前缺乏周密的準備，不能預防流弊。　　現在金圓券兌換金銀已將開始，千萬不要再蹈覆轍了。怎樣才可以便利令星小戶之兌換，怎樣才可以防止一部分人之操縱，這是要慎之於始的。實施以後，發現任何流弊，應該由執行機關迅速提出補充補救辦法。若像過去珠寶義責券以及銅輔幣等，竟使大家連影子都沒有望見，那就太對不起已經受過莫大損害的民衆了。雷學　　北美合衆國這回大選，兩位「杜先生」競選最有聲色，雖然他二位的尊姓原文的字母不同，譯作中文，却都像是「杜工部」的華宗世胄。兩杜相爭，現任者獲勝，反乎事前宜傳之預期，引起多人之驚詫與推測。在選舉以前，各國論壇說杜威可入白宮的有種種「先見之明」，至揭曉以後，說杜魯門轉敗爲勝的又有些「後見之明」。美國是新大陸上最優越亦殺別致的國家，出乎意外的事情很多，而預期與事實，亦往往不盡一致。即如羅斯福之三决連任，超乎建國之來之前例，又豈事前所能斷定？羅斯福之最後兩連任，恰在二决大戰期中，固由人望，亦因非常時期，不宜於「中途易馬」。則杜魯門之得連，未必與時代無關。現在的世界大局，劍拔弩張，儼然三决交鋒之前夕，以視一九四〇及一九四四之緊張程度，有過之無不及。　　杜魯門競選演說中，自喻其三年白宮生活於牢囚，此是俊語，亦是實話，大凡職責與責任心重者，當然有特別的不自由。位愈高。權愈重鈴愈　拘束負擔之不易，故中國官塲雖以津要貴顯爲得意，有時亦以「得卸仔肩」及「無官一身輕」爲可樂。而古代帝王權位尊榮，更在百官之上，每以「朽索馭六馬」喻「爲君難」，亦是此意。　　美總統所居曰「白宮」，因之中國歷屆元首亦稱「白宮生人」，成了漂亮的飼典，其實袁世凱等任，所住「新華宮」，即前淸之「西苑」，圍牆是紅色的，而門樓朱漆鮮明，更是顯然的「朱門」，非「白宮」也。又按「白宮」原文曰White　house，而非White　palace，正譯「白房子」，似乎不甚雅馴，二則當年中國初改國體，積習未除，提及元首，總帶些「王帽」觀念，以宮禁，宮殿之「宮」，譯美國之house，還算是尊崇之意。（宮字最初本義亦自平凡，但譯者決非本於古義。）美國爲純然民主國，「白宮」既無森嚴之警蹕，（編者按；白宮警蹕，實極森嚴，美國雜誌言之者衆矣。）「主人」亦無深居簡出之習氣。中國昔年居住新華宮之老袁等人，則端居高拱，護衛如雲，惟黎黃陂在任時，曾宣言「平民總統」，力除封建色彩，常常單人獨馬，街市游覽，事前絕無通知，警察却有些擔心無措。　　華盛頓之「白富」，與北平之「紫禁」，倒是很好的儷詞。</p>

<p>[Central News Agency, Taiyuan, 21st] An honorable contingent of a certain Nationalist troop unit, which repeatedly defeated stubborn bandits in the Taiyuan defense and established the first merit in the defense war, earning the title of Ever-Victorious Army, has had a batch of 262 soldiers, after recuperation, voluntarily request to return to the battlefield to kill bandits.

<p>[Another Dispatch] There was no major contact on any of the suburban lines in the 24 hours from the evening of the 20th to the morning of the 21st.

The weather here today is cloudy and hazy, with occasional light rain after 4:00 PM. However, our iron-winged teams continue to fly over and bomb the suburban bandits, and most of the bandit fortifications in Nuomazhuang, Guadigou, and Gangdao have been destroyed by our bombing.</p>
<p>[Another Dispatch] Our artillery has fully exerted its power in the Taiyuan defense war, which has lasted for more than 50 days, coordinating with infantry and air force to annihilate the invading bandits. In particular, howitzers have made the bandit army extremely fearful. Zhang Zhicheng, the battalion commander of a certain artillery unit, led multiple howitzers into a certain position on the night of the 18th and discovered a bandit artillery position near Guadigou in the northeast of the city, with six cannons concealed within solid fortifications. Our artillery immediately implemented firing, and several consecutive shells all hit the target, completely destroying the bandit artillery position. Subsequently, it was discovered that a regiment of bandit troops was gathered in Guadigou and was holding a meeting. Therefore, the target was immediately shifted, and a hail-like bombardment was carried out, killing most of the bandits. The remaining bandits fled in disarray, and our air force arrived. The artillery then indicated the target, enabling the air force to make a precise strafing attack, while the artillery continued to bombard. With the coordination of artillery and air force, all the bandits were annihilated. After receiving the report, Director Yan, because the unit had repeatedly exerted its power and achieved brilliant results, specifically awarded the officers and soldiers 800 cans of beef and 10 billion legal tender to encourage them.</p>

<p>[Central News Agency, Xuzhou, 21st] The Air Force based in Xuzhou continued to fly strong formations of aircraft over the area north and south of the Longhai Railway, 30 kilometers east of Xuzhou, on the 21st, covering the operations of the eastward-advancing corps. From morning until noon, the East Sea bomber formations and the Yellow Sea fighter formations launched continuous attacks, giving the bandits no chance to breathe. Maguzi and Sunzhuang north of the road, and Yuehai, Ruanjiatang, and Bujialou south of the road, were all subjected to fierce and accurate bombing. The stubborn bandits retreated in a panic, and the eastward-advancing corps took advantage of the victory to occupy all the above-mentioned areas and are continuing to expand the battle results eastward.</p>
<p>[Another Dispatch] The Battle of Xuzhou is still in the continuous pursuit phase. The bandits who were caught in a pincer movement from the east and west and were unable to escape on the eastern flank are still in various villages within 40 li between Daxujia and Nianzhuang on the 21st, deployed in depth, engaging in a desperate struggle. The eastward-advancing Nationalist corps, combined with the powerful air force, tanks, and artillery, continued to attack eastward fiercely. The Huang Corps, which is firmly holding Nianzhuang, is also using its increasingly courageous spirit to counterattack the surrounding bandits and coordinate with the operations of the eastward-advancing corps. A portion of the bandits who were unable to escape on the southern route are still being encircled and annihilated by Nationalist troops in the area south of Pantang Town on the east side of the Jinpu Railway. The suburbs of Xuzhou have been peaceful in recent days without any battles, with only localized contact occurring in Qinmin Village, more than 30 kilometers to the northwest.</p>

<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 21st] More than 1,000 wounded soldiers from our Xuzhou-Bengbu battle were airlifted to Nanjing from Xuzhou on the 21st.

<h3 id="e13">Bandit Officers and Soldiers are Tired of War and Defect <a href="#e13" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c13" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">13</a></h3>
<p>Company Commander Wu Huang Leads 37 to Return</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Xuzhou, 21st] After our victory in the Three Forts battle, the morale of Chen Yi's 3rd Column and the Guangdong-Guangxi Columns was greatly dampened. According to Wu Huang, a company commander of the bandit army who defected during the Three Forts battle: The column was exhausted from marching all night, and the officers and soldiers had no will to fight. During the fierce fighting, they hid and fled to the Nationalist army's positions. The main reasons for the column's defeat were that they were intimidated by the superior firepower of the Nationalist army, and that the officers and soldiers of the bandit army had a strong sense of war weariness. Therefore, once contact was made, except for those who were deeply indoctrinated by the bandits and stubbornly acted as cannon fodder, the others all took the opportunity to defect to the Nationalist army. Wu Huang, 27 years old, has been forced into the army for nearly five years. He joined the party in November of the year and, in view of the various darknesses of the bandits, was unwilling to be deceived and indoctrinated. During the Three Forts battle, he led the propaganda member Wu Zhongmei, the group leaders Tan Jinsheng, He Fulu, Li Zhen, Luo Yiming, Huang Zhiming (all of whom were cadre party members in the bandit army), and soldiers Liu Lianhua and 37 others, carrying one light machine gun and 32 rifles, to defect. This proves that the bandit army's war-weariness has become an indisputable ironclad proof. Also, during the Three Forts battle, when a certain corps of our army was pursuing the bandits, five soldiers, including Yang Yuxiang, from the 5th company of the 2nd Battalion of the 1st Regiment of the Guangdong-Guangxi Columns, after hearing the Nationalist army's shouts of "Welcome to defect, preferential treatment for defection," immediately shot and killed their deputy company commander, carrying three Zhongzheng rifles, one Czech rifle, one box of machine gun bullets, and 20 hand grenades to defect. The soldiers have now received a bonus of 500 yuan and are eager to go to the front line to help the Nationalist army shout and kill the enemy.</p>

<h3 id="e23">MacArthur's Visit to China Unconfirmed; U.S. Experts Advocate Sending MacArthur as Military Advisor to China <a href="#e23" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c23" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">23</a></h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] Yesterday's report about Supreme Commander of the Allied Forces in Japan, MacArthur's visit to China, was inquired about by reporters to the head of the US Information Service here. They were told that they had not heard of this news so far, and they had not heard that MacArthur was preparing to come to China. According to observations from relevant parties here, the possibility of MacArthur's visit to China is extremely small, and this news may be a misreport.</p>
<p>[United Press, Tokyo, 21st] It was widely rumored in Tokyo on the morning of the 21st that General MacArthur had already gone to China or was about to go to China, but there is apparently no factual basis for this. Allied headquarters officials here were busy answering inquiries from people trying to confirm this news. The State Department and the Department of the Army in Washington also said they had heard nothing. But no one can confirm that MacArthur would not consult with President Chiang in China. However, he would definitely not go to China in the next few hours, because first, he must meet with the heads of the Allied delegations here on the 22nd to review the verdicts of the Far East International Military Tribunal against Tojo and other 25 major war criminals; second, General Barr, the head of the U.S. Joint Military Advisory Group to China, has just arrived in Japan. Even if MacArthur intends to go to China, he will first consult with Barr. It is widely rumored here that General Barr's departure from China to come here is to consult with MacArthur and prepare a plan for MacArthur's visit to China.</p>
<p>[Another Dispatch] Senior U.S. officials here believe that the situation in China is becoming increasingly clear. Although MacArthur and his senior assistants remain silent about the situation in China, because China is not within MacArthur's administrative scope, MacArthur is undoubtedly constantly collecting detailed information about the development of the situation in China. U.S. experts here believe that appointing famous U.S. military figures such as MacArthur or General Wedemeyer as the top military advisors to the Chinese government and approving full military assistance—mainly in the form of weapons and equipment transported to China—will guarantee victory on the battlefield.</p>
<h3 id="e24">Government Allocates 100 Million US Dollars in Gold, Silver, and Foreign Exchange to Purchase Supplies and Contract Currency; US Aid Supplies to Arrive in the Country by April Next Year; Outline of Implementation of Import and Export Linking System Announced <a href="#e24" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c24" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">24</a></h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent, Nanjing, 21st] Finance Minister Xu Kan made the following remarks regarding the two cases passed by the Executive Yuan: the Outline of Implementation of the Import and Export Trade Linking System and the Key Points of the Organization of the Executive Yuan Economic Coordination Committee. On November 20th, the Executive Yuan's temporary meeting passed the Outline of Implementation of the Import and Export Trade Linking System and the Key Points of the Organization of the Executive Yuan Economic Coordination Committee, proposed by the Ministry of Finance. The main purpose is to encourage exports and facilitate overseas remittances to increase foreign exchange sources and the import of important materials. However, at present, due to the decline in domestic production, obstructed transportation, and the severe shortage of materials, increasing exports and overseas remittances alone cannot compensate. It is noted that of the total US aid materials valued at US$200 million, only US$60 million has been used so far, and materials worth another US$40 million are being sold. The remaining US$100 million has not yet been designated for use. In order to coordinate with our country's new economic measures, it has been agreed with the US Economic Cooperation Administration to expedite planning for phased purchases, aiming to transport all of them to the country before April next year, and to ensure that the funds are used through existing commercial channels as much as possible. On our country's side, the government has decided to allocate gold, silver, and foreign exchange equivalent to US$100 million to purchase domestic and foreign materials and contract currency within the above four-month period. It is expected that after the implementation of this cooperation method, the domestic material shortage problem can be solved, and it will greatly help absorb idle funds and stabilize the financial economy. Furthermore, the establishment of the Economic Coordination Committee aims to strengthen US aid coordination and improve work efficiency. In terms of Sino-US economic cooperation, it may create a new milestone.</p>
<p>[Our Correspondent, Nanjing, 21st] News Bureau News: The Outline of Implementation of the Import and Export Trade Linking System passed by the Executive Yuan's temporary meeting on the 20th is as follows: (1) All foreign exchange earned from export goods shall be handed over to the Central Bank or its designated banks in exchange for foreign exchange transfer certificates of equal value. (2) All overseas remittances and other foreign exchange remittances from overseas Chinese shall be handed over to the Central Bank or its designated banks in exchange for foreign exchange transfer certificates of equal value, and they may be directly transferred to the Central Bank or its designated bank at their discretion. (3) Foreign exchange transfer certificates may be used to offset loans required for holding import permits or for non-import foreign exchange needs approved. (4) Holders of foreign exchange transfer certificates may use or transfer them themselves in accordance with the provisions of the preceding article, and the time limit shall not exceed two months. (5) Imported goods are divided into quota and non-quota categories according to their nature. Quota goods are distributed to importers and producers, and non-quota goods are approved with priority according to domestic needs. (6) The measures for import and export trade and their appendices, as well as the Central Bank's regulations for managing foreign exchange, shall be amended separately in accordance with the provisions of this outline.</p>
<p>[Our Correspondent, Nanjing, 21st] The Executive Yuan passed the establishment of the Economic Coordination Committee on the 20th, and its key points of organization are as follows: (1) In order to coordinate US aid, regulate materials, and stabilize the financial economy, the Executive Yuan has specially established the Economic Coordination Committee. (2) The committee shall have one chairman, who shall be concurrently held by the President of the Executive Yuan or appointed by the President as a representative. The committee shall also have six members, who shall be concurrently held by the Minister of Finance, Minister of Communications, Minister of Industry and Commerce, Minister of Food, Chairman of the National Resources Commission, and the President of the Central Bank. The committee shall also have one secretary-general. (3) When the committee meets, it may invite representatives from the Economic Cooperation Administration to attend. (4) The committee shall establish an executive group, which shall be organized by representatives of the Ministry of Finance, representatives of the Central Bank, and the Secretary-General of the US Aid Committee, to implement the policies and resolutions of the committee. (5) When the executive group meets, representatives from the Economic Cooperation Administration shall be invited to attend.</p>

<h3 id="e25">Sympathy for Primary and Secondary School Teachers <a href="#e25" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c25" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">25</a></h3>
<p>The price surge following the currency reform has impacted every corner of society, with the education sector being the most severely threatened. In various places like Beijing and Shanghai, primary and secondary school teachers have been requesting relief and going on strike due to the pressure of life, which is naturally a very serious situation. From the 16th, all teachers and staff above the municipal middle school level in Shanghai took collective leave, and the municipal primary school teachers and staff also took collective leave from the 19th. Fortunately, after Mayor Wu's persuasive advocacy, they have agreed to resume teaching today, and it is hoped that there will be no further changes. Private primary and secondary school teachers are not optimistic about the authorities' relief and the schools' additional tuition fees. It is said that there is also a trend of collective leave. This is a very serious social problem and reflects the crisis of the entire education system, which deserves great attention. If the government authorities and school supervisors do not take immediate action to save the situation, it would undoubtedly be a cause for great concern.</p>
<p>The lives of primary and secondary school teachers have always been difficult, especially for teachers in public schools. They have always been understanding of the country's difficulties, obeyed the government's laws and regulations, and lived a life of poverty and joy, teaching with empty stomachs, and adhering to the sacred position of "education first," educating the second generation for the country and society. Although their lives are not as good as workers, let alone merchants, they have always endured it for the sake of their sacred responsibility. This spirit of endurance has been brought to the extreme. Recently, due to the flaws arising from the currency reform, prices have been rising crazily like a runaway horse, with the rise in the price of rice being the most significant. As a result, teachers who were already impoverished were forced to the brink of starvation. The collective leave of primary and secondary school teachers in Beijing and Shanghai, which was decided not by prior agreement, should objectively be considered a measure of going on strike because they are not able to eat enough. Subjectively, the abandonment of students' studies due to the teachers' collective leave, which affects the progress of education, cannot but be said to be a loss to the students and society. However, the vast majority of students, witnessing the hungry faces of the teachers, not only forgive the teachers' actions but also sympathize with the teachers' plight and support the teachers' position. Moreover, collective leave is a temporary measure, and the problem must be resolved and needs to be resolved quickly and satisfactorily. Mayor Wu, Chairman Pan, the principals of the schools, and the teachers all have a clear understanding of this. We hope that the teachers and the government will resume teaching resolutely based on mutual understanding.</p>
<p>The government authorities have a responsibility to solve the problem of collective leave for primary and secondary school teachers, and public opinion also has a responsibility. The fundamental solution is to rationally establish a salary system for educators so that they can serve the education cause with peace of mind. The immediate solution is to relieve the current financial difficulties of educators. The liaison association of municipal primary and secondary school teachers in Shanghai said on the 20th that before the war, the salary of municipal primary and secondary school teachers could buy five to ten piculs of rice, but the current average income is 140 to 150 yuan, which can only buy two to three dou of rice, plus three dou of allocated rice, totaling five to six dou. It is very difficult to maintain the family's life with this. This kind of predicament should be a true portrayal. They demand that the government have a fundamental solution so that the pre-war standard can be brought closer to the post-war situation. The current relief solution that addresses the immediate symptoms, is the unanimous demand of primary and secondary school teachers. They hope to get one picul of rice, two bags of flour, and 500 gold yuan as emergency relief. According to the actual situation, their demands are by no means excessive. Even if they achieve the above-mentioned relief as they ideally wish, it will not improve their living standards. Although the government authorities also feel that the funds are exhausted and it is difficult to cope with the situation, it is still hoped that they can understand their suffering and provide practical and possible relief at their discretion. At the same time, it is also hoped that the teachers will resume teaching first, restore the normal order of education, and then discuss the fundamental solution.</p>
<p>Public opinion is very sympathetic to the collective leave of municipal primary and secondary school teachers; however, some private primary and secondary schools are taking the opportunity to extend their hands to students to collect additional tuition fees, and even suspending classes to wait for payment, which should be considered. The systems of public schools and private schools are different, and the fee standards are different. The difficulties of public schools are not entirely the same as those of private schools. Although the lives of teachers in both public and private schools are equally difficult, the financial management and vested interests of private school supervisors are unlikely to suffer losses under any circumstances. At the beginning of the school year, prices were in a low ebb, and the value of the tuition fees paid by students according to the school's regulations for "this semester" has not changed. It is unreasonable for private school principals to not pay teachers' salaries in advance according to the income and expenditure budget at the beginning of the school year and now want to shift the monetary losses to the students' parents. The Bureau of Education's permission for private schools to collect "respect for teachers' money" or "teachers' welfare money" from parents opens the door for private schools to increase tuition fees. Families with better financial conditions should have a sense of responsibility and should provide assistance to the schools' difficulties; but for families in poverty and civil servants' families, this unexpected burden is indeed difficult to bear. Based on morality and conscience, the parents of poor students should not feel guilty for not accepting the additional tuition fees from private schools. It is hoped that the education authorities and private schools will recognize this clearly and not make mandatory regulations to avoid causing social disturbances.</p>
<p>In short, the current situation of the entire education system is facing the most serious and dangerous stage. Those who are responsible should not abandon their duties and should firmly take responsibility to quickly improve the living conditions of teachers at all levels, rescue the education crisis, and overcome the current difficulties.</p>

The original telegram said: "The bandits Chen Yi and Liu Bocheng, etc., gathered 500,000 troops to invade Xuzhou. The great battle began on the 6th. Relying on the confidential deployment of our Commander-in-Chief Liu and the orders of the soldiers, the stubborn enemies were repeatedly defeated. It is estimated that more than 100,000 bandits have been wiped out in the past few days. The glorious record is unprecedented since the suppression of bandits. The good news has spread, and the people are excited and happy. The spirit of sacrifice and the heroic deeds of our national army soldiers on the battlefield are especially commendable. In order to encourage morale, eliminate the stubborn bandits again, permanently stabilize the Jianghuai area, and restore our Lu and Yu, in addition to the extensive mobilization of funds by our association in various counties and cities to comfort the troops, we deeply feel that the financial resources of one place are meager and insufficient to reward the battle achievements of the soldiers who have fought hard and established meritorious services on the border. Therefore, we dare to telegraph your association, mobilize various groups in Kyoto and Shanghai, understand the hardship of the bloody battles and the hardship of the soldiers, respond to the mobilization of funds to comfort the troops, so as to encourage morale, so as to complete the mission of suppressing the rebellion. I respectfully report the telegram, hoping for your consideration."</p>

Note: Compatriots here have been extremely depressed since hearing of the fall of Shenyang seven weeks ago. Today, hearing the good news from Xuzhou, they are all cheered up.

<h3 id="e32">Nanyang Overseas Chinese Taiwan Visiting Group Encourages Overseas Compatriots to Return to the Country to Invest; Dai Kui Sheng and Qiu Hanping Broadcast to Overseas Chinese <a href="#e32" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c32" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">32</a></h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Taipei, 20th] Dai Kui Sheng, leader of the Nanyang Overseas Chinese organization's Taiwan visiting group, recently broadcast to overseas compatriots here, saying: "Today's new world situation has forced overseas Chinese to find a new way out. Under the current situation of war clouds and disturbances everywhere in Southeast Asia, we believe that Taiwan is a relatively stable place where overseas Chinese wealth and manpower can be placed." Another overseas Chinese leader, Qiu Hanping, followed Dai and broadcast to overseas Chinese compatriots, saying: "Since the two world wars, the politics and economy of every corner of the world have undergone major changes. The impact on overseas Chinese is beyond words. In the past, overseas Chinese were welcomed everywhere, but now they are suffering everywhere. The current situation of overseas Chinese is very different from before. We should find a new way out. In the past, the virtues of overseas Chinese were enduring hardship, diligence, thrift, keeping to themselves, and a spirit of sacrifice, which created the status of overseas Chinese, but they all focused on personal struggle and lacked an organization suitable for modern large-scale enterprise groups. If we don't turn back now, it will be too late. I believe that the economic undertakings of overseas Chinese in the future should pay attention to the following four points: First, we should communicate international trade. Overseas Chinese have abundant capital and outstanding commercial talents. In the current environment of imbalance in the supply and demand of materials between China and foreign countries, overseas Chinese must engage in international trade to cooperate with the motherland's economic policies. In this way, not only will overseas Chinese find a way out, but the motherland and the place of residence will also be able to obtain material regulation. Second, we should popularize the company organization. In the past, most of the economic undertakings of overseas Chinese were sole proprietorships. Once they encountered setbacks, they would collapse and all their previous efforts would be in vain. In the past 20 years, although there have been occasional companies, most of them are still nominal. This old concept, which is not suitable for modern trends, should be abandoned. We must use the power of the people and work together to organize various joint-stock companies, entrust special parties to be responsible for management, and let those with capital decide the direction and guide the path, so that the business is stable and avoids conflicts of interest with individuals in the past. Third, we should return to the country to invest in production undertakings. In the past, the amount of overseas remittances has always been huge, but unfortunately, it has only been used for personal wealth, such as building houses and buying fields, and even building temples to worship Buddha. At most, it has only been used to run hometown education undertakings. The investment in production undertakings is really rare. In the future, we must pay attention to investing in production undertakings to prevent this increasingly serious world situation. As for the general public who believe that the current turbulent situation in the motherland is not conducive to investment, this is a mistake. There are many production undertakings with favorable development in the rear, and safety is not a problem. If investing in the country is considered unsafe, then where is the safety in the troubled Southeast Asia? Fourth, we should embark on the path of industrial and mining enterprises. In the past, most overseas Chinese engaged in the retail industry. In the future, in order to avoid being controlled by the local environment, we should embark on the path of industrial and mining enterprises. This is not only beneficial to personal economy, but also beneficial to local prosperity and government revenue. We will definitely be welcomed and assisted by local people and the government.</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper Beiping 20th Dispatch] Hu Shi gave a speech on the international situation at the North China Suppression Headquarters at 3:00 PM on the 20th, concluding that "Negotiation is more difficult than war. Endure hardship and await change." Hu Shi's speech on the issue of peace included: "Don't be impatient in demanding peace. Negotiation is more difficult than war, a thousand times more difficult. To talk about peace with the Chinese Communists is simply a fantasy." He cited Marshall as an example, saying: Marshall was the chief of staff of the Allied democratic countries in the Second World War. He defeated the Axis powers of Germany and Japan, but after spending years in China, he could not make the peace talks between the Nationalists and Communists succeed. Hu Shi concluded that the only thing to do now is to endure hardship and await change. The so-called awaiting change does not necessarily mean the outbreak of a third world war. As long as we have confidence in our way of life (a way of life with democracy, freedom, and peace) and can endure, then in six months or a year, the situation will not be without change. This change will definitely benefit us. When asked about the impact of Truman's election on the overall situation, Hu Shi read a section of Truman's March last year's message to Congress requesting assistance to Greece and Turkey, believing that Truman would definitely follow the precedent of assisting Greece and Turkey to assist China. He believes that Beiping will never be lost, so he told foreign reporters that Peking University will not move in a month, two months, half a year, or a year.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper Dispatch] A responsible person from the Youth Party here unofficially expressed his views on the current situation, believing that there is absolutely no possibility of restoring peace talks at present, because the prerequisite for achieving domestic peace is that the Chinese Communists withdraw from the Communist International and abandon armed struggle, and to expect the Chinese Communists to make such concessions is like trying to find fish in trees. Conversely, if a "coalition government" is formed with the Chinese Communists as the center, the fate of our country will be no different from that of Czechoslovakia and Hungary. The only hope at present is to create a foundation for domestic peace through international coordination and to hope that the authorities will conscientiously implement democracy to eliminate domestic difficulties.</p>

<p>Believing it Relates to the Happiness of the Nation and Mankind</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing 21st Dispatch] Bishop Yu Bin delivered a speech at the joint annual meeting of the Sixth and Seventh Sessions of the Chinese Catholic Cultural Association on the 21st, criticizing the general public's lack of clear understanding of the current issues, which has led to the current serious situation. He pointed out that today's war is a comprehensive cultural war, a war without national borders or family boundaries. It must start with ideological warfare, arm the people's will, build a spiritual Great Wall, and have everyone fight, so that the country's future and human happiness can be guaranteed. Yu Bin analyzed the nature of the anti-communist war, saying: Today's duel between the two major camps in the world is regarded by some people in our country as an internal strife or a suppression of rebellion, which cannot encompass the nature of the war. The communist aggression is a very serious situation that threatens the current world and cannot be compared with the rebellions that have been commonplace in history.</p>

<p>To the brave army and air force soldiers on the front lines of Xuzhou, Taiyuan, eastern Chahar, and eastern Shaanxi who are suppressing the rebellion:</p>
<p>Recently, with the victory in Xuzhou, the steadfast defense of Taiyuan, and the great victories in eastern Chahar and eastern Shaanxi, our brave soldiers on all fronts, with the revolutionary spirit of loving the country and loving the nation, have fought hard against the bandit army, annihilated the main force of the bandit army, and won brilliant victories. In particular, this decisive battle in Xuzhou has stabilized Xuzhou, Nanjing, and Shanghai, and consolidated the foundation of the country. Its significance is even more significant. These great victories have made the whole country and the world unanimously recognize that our National Revolutionary Army has always defended the motherland with its blood and maintained justice, and will never be succumbed to violence, nor will it be threatened by the international fifth column. Soldiers, this great achievement is deeply appreciated by the people of the whole country and admired by all those who uphold justice in the world. I would like to take this opportunity to express my most sincere and highest respect to all of you, national heroes and soldiers.</p>
<p>If we want to understand the meaning of suppressing the rebellion and the value of the sacrifices and struggles of all the soldiers, we must first understand the essence of this suppression war. The Communist bandits, under the instructions of the Third International, carried out a conspiracy to invade China, and after the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, they first seized the Northeast, and then roamed and disturbed various places, and finally launched a full-scale rebellion. On the one hand, they spread insane propaganda, saying that our suppression war was an internal strife. In fact, the rebellion of the Communist bandits is a kind of aggressive war of the Third International against China. What is the basis for us to say that the rebellion of the Communist bandits is an aggressive war? It is because they endanger the territorial integrity and sovereignty of our country and endanger the independence and freedom of our nation. Take the Northeast as an example. The Communist bandits took the Third International as a cover to seize our resources. The Communist bandits took the red imperialists as a vanguard to occupy our land. Now the Northeast has become a red puppet state of Manchuria. If China is unfortunate, and the political power of the country falls into the hands of the Communist bandits, then our country will be ruled by the red imperialists, and our country will become a second Outer Mongolia. Therefore, the purpose of our suppressing the rebellion is to protect the integrity of the country's territory and sovereignty and to protect the nation's independence and freedom. In other words, our suppressing war is a national war against red aggression. Therefore, our suppressing is to resist aggression externally and to overthrow the traitors internally. All the soldiers who fight for the suppressing war are our most respected national heroes. We hope that all the soldiers on the front lines will use the spirit of winning the Anti-Japanese War in the past to win the victory in the suppressing war.</p>
<p>The conspiracy of the Third International is not only to communize China, but also to communize Asia, and even to communize the world. Therefore, our efforts to suppress the bandits should, on the one hand, unite the people of the whole country to fight for the protection of the country's national independence and freedom, and on the other hand, unite the countries and nations in the world that are harmed by the conspiracy of the Third International to fight against the aggression of red imperialism. The Second World War was when the anti-aggression countries in the world, under the United Front, defeated the aggression of the German, Japanese, and Italian fascists. Now the world's anti-aggression front has taken shape, and the prelude to the Third World War against aggression has also begun in Asia and Eastern Europe. We believe that the final victory will surely belong to those who are fighting to protect the survival and independence of the country and nation.</p>
<p>Based on the words we have said above, we can definitely tell you that the group of Chinese traitors and bandits, the so-called Chinese Communist Party, will never succeed in China. Their rebellion in China will eventually be suppressed. Please look at the history of the world, please look at the trends of modern times, any nation-state that fights to defend the motherland and resist direct or indirect aggression has not gained final victory and success. Our suppression of bandits today is a national war against aggression, so it must succeed in the end. We once won a glorious victory in the Anti-Japanese War, so the war to suppress bandits will surely win a glorious victory. As long as you recognize history, recognize the trends, strengthen your faith, and strengthen your struggle, the largest number of patriotic compatriots in the country and the largest number of people in the world who uphold justice are standing on the same line with you, determined to back you up. We dare to guarantee that this suppression war will surely succeed.</p>

<p>[United Press Berlin 21st Dispatch] The Soviet military-sponsored "Daily Review" stated today that as soon as the Western Allies accept the Soviet mark as the sole currency of Berlin, the Soviet Union can lift the "traffic restrictions" on Berlin. The newspaper said that the blockade would end simultaneously with the withdrawal of the marks illegally issued by the West. The newspaper put forward three suggestions for solving the German problem: (1) Conclude a German peace treaty; (2) Establish a German central government; (3) Withdraw all occupying forces. The British issued an official statement stating that the four powers originally agreed to use the Soviet head office mark as the sole currency of Berlin, but Soviet Military Governor Sokolovsky demanded that the Soviet Union completely control Berlin's trade and also demanded that the West accept Soviet traffic control, including air routes, so the four powers were prevented from forming an agreement.</p>

<p>— Translated by Shi</p>
<p>The internal politics of the Soviet Union have not yet been fully understood by the people of the world. Therefore, the extent of Stalin's authority has become a mystery. Some speculate that Stalin is the true ruler of the Soviet Union, but President Truman doubts this conjecture, believing that Stalin is a captive of the Soviet administrative bureau. Some believe that Soviet administrative strategy is determined by the administrative bureau organized by thirteen Soviet political leaders, while others believe that Soviet administrative strategy is determined by the military authorities.</p>
<p>Because General Sokolovsky, the Soviet military commander in Germany, once disobeyed the treaties signed in Moscow by the three-nation diplomats and Stalin, some mistakenly believed that Soviet generals had the power to defy Stalin's orders. In reality, this is impossible. Not only can the military authorities not control Stalin and the administrative bureau, but the military authorities are also subject to the control of the administrative bureau and Stalin.</p>
<p>Stalin's position in the Soviet Union is that of a unique ruler; he now possesses two hundred million people and six million Soviet communists. The Soviet dictator is a product of the party apparatus. The administrative bureau is composed of thirteen Soviet political leaders, but it is not a cabinet; it is merely a branch of the Central Committee of the Soviet Communist Party. However, the national policy of the Soviet Union is mostly determined by this organization.</p>
<p>During public meetings held last year, we could often find Foreign Minister Molotov, Communist Party Secretary Zhdanov, and General Voroshilov sitting next to Head of State Stalin. Since Zhdanov's death this year, two new figures have been added next to Head of State Stalin at every meeting: Malenkov and Beria. It is very obvious who Head of State Stalin's most trusted figures are; we can see it at a glance from the meeting photos.</p>
<p>Within the administrative bureau, in addition to Head of State Stalin, there are three figures who are relatively the most authoritative: Molotov, Malenkov, and Beria. These three figures are sometimes referred to as the "Troika."</p>
<p>Molotov is the Soviet Foreign Minister and is the most well-known figure in the eyes of Western diplomats. He is an old friend of Stalin and has been working with Stalin for thirty-five years.</p>
<p>Malenkov is one of the administrative committee members and was formerly Stalin's personal secretary. He is forty-five years old this year. He has a particularly strong memory. Although he has never been abroad, he is very familiar with the industrial conditions of Europe, Asia, and America because he once served as the chairman of the wartime Soviet Heavy Industry Committee.</p>
<p>Beria is the commander of the Soviet Twenty Division Secret Police and the director of the Soviet prison camps. Relying on his organization, his power not only extends throughout the country but also expands to the Soviet satellite states and other regions.</p>
<p>The so-called "Troika" of the administrative bureau—Stalin's trusted figures—is not fixed. In other words, in order to test the abilities of the administrative bureau's committee members, all thirteen committee members of the administrative bureau have the potential to be regarded as trusted figures. The three figures mentioned above are currently the trusted figures in Stalin's mind.</p>
<p>The meetings and activities of the administrative bureau are very mysterious. The thirteen committee members of the administrative bureau often live in the Kremlin and do not often go out. High-ranking members of the Soviet Communist Party and specialized talents are sometimes summoned to the palace to participate in administrative bureau meetings and express their opinions, but this is merely an occasional occurrence.</p>
<p>The administrative bureau members are all promoted based on their own abilities. Before entering the administrative bureau, they have been repeatedly tested and have also been thoroughly monitored and examined by the secret police. They are all believers in Stalin. During administrative bureau meetings, these thirteen committee members are not all Stalin's "yes-men"; they all have the right to speak freely. Not only can they criticize national policy, the policies of the Communist Party, and others, but they can also sometimes argue with Stalin's suggestions. Whenever a matter is discussed, all thirteen committee members can express their opinions freely. If the debate becomes deadlocked, Head of State Stalin often makes the final decision. At that point, the discussion of the matter comes to an end. Even if you are not entirely satisfied with the decision on the matter, you must sacrifice your own opinions and implement the political strategy.</p>
<p>The decisions of the administrative bureau are not without errors, but when an error is discovered, a meeting is immediately held to change the strategy. The administrative bureau committee members are not like low-level party members who need to be familiar with Lenin's teachings; they are all realists. Stalin is nearly seventy years old. Who is his successor? It is possible that the "Troika" mentioned above will act on his behalf, but it is also very possible that Malenkov will directly inherit. The list of the thirteen leaders of the Soviet administrative bureau is as follows: Stalin, Molotov, Malenkov, Beria, Voroshilov, Mikoyan, Andreyev, Kaganovich, Khrushchev, Voznesensky, Shvernik, Bulganin, Kosygin.

<h3 id="e61">Our Representative Explains Stance on Resolving the Palestine Problem, Fully Supports Bernadotte Plan <a href="#e61" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c61" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">61</a></h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Paris, 20th] Liu Chieh, our country's representative attending the UN General Assembly, delivered a speech in the UN Political Committee today, stating our country's position on the Palestine problem as follows: (1) China supports the eleven-point conclusions of the late United Nations Palestine mediator Bernadotte, which were recently re-submitted by acting mediator Bunche. (2) China supports the United Kingdom's new proposal to establish a Palestine "Reconciliation Committee." (3) China opposes "faits accomplis" created by force. (4) China supports the early return of nearly 500,000 Arab refugees to their original homes in Palestine. Mr. Liu pointed out that although China abstained from voting on the partitioning plan in November of last year, the current situation in Palestine has presented a new situation that requires renewed efforts in reconciliation. Mr. Liu also praised Bernadotte's conclusions, calling them "completely objective and generally fair and impartial." If Mr. Bernadotte's report can serve as the basis for a solution, the entire issue of territorial demarcation can be entrusted to the Reconciliation Committee, and it is hoped that the committee can strive to achieve an agreement between the Jewish and Arab sides. Liu Chieh concluded, "We hope that the Reconciliation Committee and the Arab and Jewish authorities can transform the current state of truce and armistice into a permanent peace next year and establish a new temple of friendship in the heart of the Holy Land."</p>
<p>[United Press, Paris, 20th] At the beginning of the committee debate, Britain requested the UN General Assembly to pass Bernadotte's recommendations, including the Jewish abandonment of the southern Negev, according to which Israel's territory would be reduced by about 60%. The United States agreed with Bernadotte's other recommendations but supported Israel's request to maintain the original plan. US Representative Jessup said that although the United States opposes ceding the Negev to the Arabs, believing that Israel's territory cannot be reduced without the full consent of the Jewish people, it also believes that it is necessary to continue to seek a way for both parties to reach an agreement and not to draw special boundaries at this time.</p>

<p>[United Press, Paris, 21st] The French political situation and labor unrest tended to subside on the 21st, with only the seven-week-long coal miners' strike still causing trouble.

<p>[Agence France-Presse, Athens, 21st] When the Greek Parliament held a vote of confidence this morning, the new coalition government of the Liberal Party and the People's Party passed by only two votes, 169 to 167. The leader of the opposition United Party, Canellopoulos, declared that the new government's lifespan would last no more than two months.</p>
<p>[United Press, Athens, 21st] The Greek Parliament passed a vote of confidence in the new Sophoulis cabinet by a vote of 168 to 167, a margin of only one vote. Sophoulis immediately stated that this one-vote majority was sufficient. However, former Prime Minister and current opposition leader Papandreou said that this one-vote majority was actually illegal and should be considered a vote of no confidence. He pointed out that according to the constitution, the government should receive more than half of the total number of votes of the members of parliament to be established. The parliament currently cast 335 votes, so at least 168 and a half votes were needed to obtain a vote of confidence. Moreover, during the vote, a pro-government member of parliament arrived late. Although the opposition protested vehemently, he was still allowed to vote, which further complicated the situation. Sophoulis was also unsure whether the member's vote gave the government a total of 168 or 169 votes, but claimed that the government had obtained a majority of votes and that there was no need to pursue the matter further. Political observers unanimously believe that if the government wants to secure its position, it must immediately expand its base and invite opposition parties to join the cabinet.</p>
<h3 id="e68">US Senate Advisor Clark Advocates Full Military and Economic Aid to China <a href="#e68" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c68" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">68</a></h3>
<p>Piecing Together Aid is Insufficient to Improve China's Current Situation; Only by Giving China Greater Assistance Can the Communist Advance be Stopped.</p>
<p>[US News Service, Washington, 20th] According to a report released today by a Senate committee delegation, the United States must provide China with more economic and military aid if it wants to curb the advance of the Chinese Communists. This report, prepared by former Senator Clark, advisor to the Senate Appropriations Committee, outlines a five-point plan generally believed to be necessary to save China: (1) Immediate and extensive military assistance with artillery, aircraft, and bullets. (2) Assistance in the form of combat advisors. (3) Economic assistance in an amount sufficient to offset the majority of China's domestic budget for war expenditures. (4) Economic assistance to stabilize China's currency. (5) Strict American oversight of all expenditures under any Sino-American loan agreement. The report also strongly argues that "piecemeal aid" cannot save China from falling into the hands of the Communists, and states, "A comprehensive plan is required at this time." The Clark delegation was sent to China in October of this year by Senator Bridges, chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee of the 80th Congress. Bridges has consistently advocated that the United States increase aid to China. Recently, in view of the critical situation in China, he suggested convening a special session of Congress to discuss this aid. However, President Truman recently stated at a press conference that a special session of Congress will not be convened and that any increase in aid to China must be considered in the 81st Congress, which will convene in January of next year. Bridges, a Republican, will no longer serve as chairman of the Appropriations Committee in the new Senate, where Democrats hold a majority. Clark's report includes China's social, economic, financial, and military needs, and states that these needs are "completely inseparable." The report states that this report is based on a large amount of reports and statistical material, as well as the results of discussions with American officials in China and with government, business, banking, and civilian leaders, and has been compiled accordingly. The report, in recommending extensive military assistance, pointed out China's "precarious supply situation," and pointed out the rapid deterioration of China's motorized transportation vehicles and the impending exhaustion of Japanese and American supplies received at the end of the war, "only the temporary assistance" being American surplus materials obtained through the China Executive Yuan's Materials Supply Bureau. The report further pointed out China's "precarious financial situation" due to the slow delivery of $125,000,000 in aid approved by the US Congress this year, which the Chinese government stipulated to be used for the purchase of military supplies. The report generally states that the current situation is "a situation of rapidly dwindling supplies," and that "the hope of no other replenishment except for extremely limited replenishment is now apparent." The report also states, "Only by increasing the authority of American advisors can these military deficiencies be remedied," and that the opinions of American military advisors may "eliminate unwise strategies, or may make victory replace failure." Regarding the issue of stabilizing China's economy, the report puts forward a three-point plan: The report states that a large amount of effective military assistance must first be considered in any financial plan, because "unless the imbalance of payments caused by the war no longer exists, there is no possibility of stabilizing China's currency or its economic situation." The report states: If the budget can be balanced, the United States can restore China's monetary credit through US dollar loans to China. The loan is to be used for stabilization preparation for a period of five years and can be extended. The loan shall not be less than 200 million US dollars. This gold reserve should be kept by the United States and its use should be limited to monetary reserves. The third point of the stabilization plan is a ten-year to twenty-year construction loan plan. Industries that have already been established but need to be completely or partially rebuilt can enjoy priority for this loan. The report listed the benefits of these various financial measures, believing that "once war expenditures cease, China will be in a favorable position to balance the budget, and the obstacles to stabilizing the currency can be eliminated. Once the currency gains widespread trust, it can stimulate various efforts. Coupled with financial assistance for industrial reconstruction, the increase in production and imports necessary for China's recovery can be easily achieved." The report then pointed out the contribution that a free and revived China could make to the world economy. China's import needs are very important to other parts of the world. Its exports, although greatly reduced due to government "freezing" and currency changes, are mostly goods needed by other countries, "and these materials cannot be obtained from other places." The report finally briefly outlined its five basic recommendations, acknowledging that this aid plan is "thorough and wide-ranging." The conclusion states: From the perspective of those who drafted the plan, "any action less than this plan cannot complete this task." (End)</p>

<p>Worked as a Servant All Her Life and Had No Boyfriend</p>
<p>[United Press, St. Asaph, Wales, 20th] Ms. Hepworth, Britain's longest-lived star, passed away today at the age of 115. However, no one knows Ms. Hepworth's actual age for sure, and it may be even higher. Ms. Hepworth was born in London, when birth registration was not yet compulsory. It is known that Ms. Hepworth was born during the reign of William IV (1830-47). According to her own account, she can still remember the coronation of Queen Victoria on June 28, 1838. The British government's annuity committee ordered proof of Ms. Hepworth's age in the records in 1908, stating that she was over 75 years old. She worked as a maid for most of her life and said that the reason for her longevity was diligent work and having no boyfriend.</p>

<h3 id="e70">Deposits Exchanged for Gold and Silver Begin Today; Mint Rushes to Cast Gold Bars Day and Night <a href="#e70" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c70" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">70</a></h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] Starting today, deposits exchanged for gold and silver will begin simultaneously in the seven major cities of Nanjing, Shanghai, Wuhan, Chongqing, Beiping, Tianjin, and Guangzhou. In Shanghai, the Bank of China, Bank of Communications, Farmers Bank, and the Central Bank's Business Bureau will handle the exchanges during business hours. Exchanges will be limited to gold bars and silver coins. The exchange of silver dollars will be limited to a minimum of one yuan and a maximum of forty-nine yuan, because fifty yuan in silver dollars can be exchanged for five mace of gold. The deposit and exchange of gold will start at half a tael, with unlimited supply. All deposit procedures will be completed at the same time as the exchange. Transactions will be limited to cash, and no negotiable instruments will be accepted, in accordance with the authorities' original intention to contract the currency. According to observations by relevant people, it is feared that there will still be more small households making exchanges in the future. In addition, the police bureau's original plan to investigate and detect gold banknotes has been abandoned due to changes in the authorities' policies.</p>
<p>[Another Report] The National Banks in nineteen locations, including Hangzhou and Wuhu, will begin exchanging on the first of next month. With few days remaining, the Central Mint has been ordered to rush to cast gold ingots and is working day and night so that they can be airlifted to various locations by the end of this month for preparation. As for the fineness of the gold bars, they are all 995.5. The serial number, fineness, and amount of gold are engraved on the front, and the words "Made by the Central Mint" are engraved on the back. The ten-tael gold bars are also engraved with ancient coins. According to the authorities, the Central Mint is currently stepping up arrangements, and after the machinery and equipment are organized, the production volume will greatly increase.</p>

<p>Group A Football League: A Thrilling Situation; Jingwu Loses to Zhichao; China Aviation Forces a Draw with the Leader</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] In the Group A football league, there was one match in the morning and one in the afternoon yesterday, held at Yiyuan. In the morning, Jingwu declined after initial success, losing to Zhichao by a score of 2-3. Jingwu had scored two goals first, taking a 2-0 lead, but could not maintain this winning situation. In the first half, Zhichao tied the score to 2-2. In the last two minutes, Wu Qixiang scored a free kick, and Qian Yunqing scored the third goal, with Zhichao reversing the defeat to win 3-2. In the afternoon, the match between the Leading Team and the China Aviation Team ended in a draw. The Leading Team took the lead in the first half by scoring one goal, but in the second half, due to the goalkeeper being changed to a forward, Yan Chengkuan moved to the front line. Zou Ming panicked in the face of the attack, and Gao Xiuqing of China Aviation scored, tying the score. Before the end of the match, Yin Qingbing of China Aviation scored a goal, but Xu Zuguo dribbled the ball out of bounds, and Gao Xiuqing counter-claimed offside. The referee disallowed the goal, and the supporters of China Aviation protested vehemently, criticizing the referee, almost leading to an unpleasant situation. There were an estimated four to five thousand spectators at Yiyuan in the afternoon, which was quite lively. The details of the two matches are as follows:</p>
<p>Zhichao Scores One Goal, Narrowly Defeating Jingwu</p>
<p>In the match between Zhichao and Jingwu, both sides had offensive plays in the first half. After more than ten minutes of stalemate, Ma Qunxian of Jingwu received support from the rear, dribbled past the defense line, and scored a powerful shot near the goal, scoring the first goal. Jingwu's morale was greatly boosted, and the Zhichao goal was heavily defended. Ma Qunxian scored twice. Two minutes after the first goal, Zhichao conceded another goal. Afterwards, fortune turned for the better. Qian Yunqing received a pass from Huang Jingui and scored a goal, and Yunqing scored again, tying the score at 2-2 in the first half. In the second half, both sides had excellent opportunities, but failed to capitalize. In the last two minutes, Wu Qixiang took a penalty kick, sending the ball straight to the center, and Yunqing took the opportunity to deflect it in. Chen Huimin stood there as if turned to wood. Zhichao then powerfully defeated Jingwu 3-2.</p>

<p>China Aviation and Leading Team Play to a Draw</p>
<p>In the match between China Aviation and the Leading Team, the Leading Team kicked off first, and there were back-and-forth plays. After ten minutes, Jin Chuan committed a foul outside the penalty area, and Jiang Kun took a free kick. The ball was fast and fierce, and China Aviation's goalkeeper Xu Fusheng barely managed to deflect it into a corner kick. Four minutes later, Jiang Kun took another corner kick, and Shi Dafa passed it to the left. Jiang Kun took a shot and it went into the net. China Aviation launched a counterattack, but it was unsuccessful. The Leading Team led 1-0 in the first half.</p>
<p>In the second half, the two teams played again, and the Leading Team's lineup changed, resulting in a big mistake. Goalkeeper Cheng Kuan took the position of forward, with Shao Ming taking his place. China Aviation launched a counterattack, and the attack was fierce. After more than twenty minutes, Gao Xiuqing made a solo raid. Wang Baoshan and Wu Kaimin rushed to defend, and goalkeeper Shao Ming rushed out anxiously, leaving an empty goal. Xiao Gao flicked the ball, and it flew into the net. After tying the score, both sides attacked each other, but there was no winner. Before the end of the match, Xu Zuguo of China Aviation advanced quickly along the side, dribbling the ball out of bounds. The referee did not notice, and the ball was passed in front of the goal. Yin Qingbing hooked the ball and it went into the net. However, Gao Xiuqing was too eager to win and had already sneaked into the net in an offside position. The referee ruled that the goal did not count. Afterwards, the two sides engaged in a back-and-forth battle, and the match ended in a 1-1 draw.</p>

<p>The Mysterious City of Taiyuan</p>
<p>By Our Newspaper Reporter Guo Zhongshu</p>
<p>[Airmail from Taiyuan, 12th of the Month] In today's rapidly deteriorating situation in North China, the Battle of Taiyuan has attracted the attention of the entire nation and has even become an enigma. Taiyuan's troop strength and environment cannot compare to Shenyang, Jinzhou, or Jinan. Even the environment of Changchun, which has been besieged for seven or eight months, is far superior to that of Taiyuan. Changchun has two well-equipped and powerful armies, completely isolated, and has not even reached a year. However, the communist bandits cut off Taiyuan's external land transportation two years ago. In the bandit suppression war sequence, Datong District north of Yanguan is under the jurisdiction of General Fu Zuoyi, Linfen and Yuncheng Districts south of Hanhouling are under the command of General Hu Zongnan, and the area under the jurisdiction of the Taiyuan Pacification Headquarters is only a narrow strip of land stretching from Xinxian in the north to Jiexiu in the south, forming a "lone island in a red sea."</p>
<p>The Jinzhong Campaign</p>
<p>During the Jinzhong Campaign in the summer months of June, July, and August, all the counties and districts outside the Taiyuan urban area were lost, and the Taiyuan urban area became an incomplete isolated island. Only after the recapture of Shentangou and Yeyu on the mountainous edge of the west bank of the Fen River west of the city on September 8, was the threat to Taiyuan city lifted. The city periphery maintains 60 li to the north to Dahuangzhai Town, holds a stalemate with the bandits in the area 30 to 40 li from the city at the junction of Yangqu and Shouyang in the east, and the west and south of the urban area and the area 20 li south and west of the city south of Yeyu Dongru Old South Airport have been occupied by the bandits. The extent of the lack of manpower and material resources can easily be imagined, especially the food for the military and civilians, which relies solely on air transport for replenishment. Speaking of troop strength, since the restoration three years ago, except for the troops of the Second War Zone at that time, not a single soldier or pawn has been added by the government. Moreover, one division was sacrificed in Linfen, and one division is still garrisoned in Datong to this day. However, in terms of numbers and quotas, it cannot be said that there are too few. It should be known that these are troops exhausted from the Anti-Japanese War. During the Changzhi Campaign in southeastern Jin in the winter of the 24th year, they fought almost the entire strength of the communist bandits at that time, fighting with Peng Dehuai and Liu Bocheng, and lost about two-thirds of their entire strength. Since then, they have been fighting while replenishing, that is, replenishing in battle over the long years. After the main force of the communist bandits and our forces in the Fenyang Xiaoyi District were both severely damaged in a decisive battle this spring, the losses of the National Army in the Jinzhong Campaign here were the most severe. Therefore, officers and soldiers had to loudly ask the central government and the public for help. The air transport reinforcements that arrived were no more than a little less than one division. In the recent emergency situation of the Taiyuan offensive and defensive battle, the air transport reinforcements that arrived were even more limited.</p>
<p>The Banditry Assistance Never Ends</p>
<p>We know that the number of bandits has long reached more than 200,000, and the number of those killed and wounded by the National Army has reached a staggering number of more than 90,000. However, the bandits can constantly coerce the people to fill the cannon fodder and change bullets, and they can also transfer reinforcements from all directions at any time. We can say with certainty that the National Army is at an absolute disadvantage in terms of both manpower and material resources. Originally, in the battle of Datong last autumn, the fierce bandits finally collapsed after 45 days, and Xinxian also failed after 40 or 50 days. A small Yingxian was able to resolutely resist and was not captured by the bandits, and Linfen was lost after struggling for 75 days. Given the importance of Taiyuan and under the direct command of the supreme commander of the Taiyuan Pacification Zone, the battle results were not considered strange. However, in this one-sided North China shock, Taiyuan, which has been isolated and dangerous for the longest time and has extremely weak strength, has been able to avoid being affected by this shock wave. Even as of today, it can be regarded as uniquely capable of demonstrating outstanding battle achievements, promoting national prestige, boosting morale, inspiring the people, and contributing to the country. It is worthy of praise, and it is no wonder that it has won the attention and surprise of the entire country. The bandit suppression work in Taiyuan is due to its firm will and profound understanding. No matter how precarious the situation is, the people are always firm and consistent.</p>
<p>Purging the Puppet Regime</p>
<p>In Taiyuan, the work of purging the puppet regime has been carried out by the troops to the military posts and by the people to the neighborhood. Although it cannot be said that there is not a single communist disguised as a puppet, it is very difficult for them to hide for long. The "three-day work" of self-cleansing, self-defense, and self-government has been done very thoroughly. This time, the incident of Huang Qiaosong, the second Wu Huawen, was discovered in advance. Of course, it was due to the fact that his subordinates knew righteousness and knew integrity and reported him. However, Mr. Yan Xishan also made every effort to prevent the 30th Division. Mr. Yan treated the division with great generosity, granting them everything they asked for and even giving them what they did not ask for. Therefore, Huang Qiaosong alone could not have rebelled. Third, the integration of military, political, economic, and educational affairs. Outsiders say that Shanxi is special, and it is special because of the integration of military, political, economic, and educational affairs. Only with its integration can the implementation of the overall war be ensured.</p>
<p>Factories and Airports</p>
<p>In terms of economy, dozens of large-scale light and heavy industrial factories in Jin not only have every chimney smoking as usual, but also tens of thousands of employees are not only not slacking off, but are stepping up manufacturing under the artillery fire. In addition to supplying military use and people's daily necessities, there is also surplus capacity for external export. Large quantities of steel and other products are still being transported to the outside world by air as usual. Air transport has long become Taiyuan's only respirator. Originally, there were two airports built, one in the north and one in the south. During the Jinzhong Campaign, a new South Airport was built five li south of the city. After the Taiyuan War broke out, a new airport was rushed to build outside the East Gate, near the city. The evolution of the war has made all four airports ineffective, but a new airport has been built in the west of the city. This airport is currently providing breathing functions for the military and civilians of Taiyuan. This is another clear evidence of the firm confidence of the military and civilians of Taiyuan and the effectiveness of the overall war.</p>
<p>Numerous Bunkers</p>
<p>Fourth, there are numerous bunkers and solid fortifications. Some people think that bunker fortifications are static and combat is dynamic. This view is not without some justification, but in terms of guarding points, especially cities that must be guarded strategically and politically, bunker fortifications still have their undeniable value. The fact that the northern front of Taiyuan City can be stabilized, the east of the city and the advance and retreat of the mountainous areas in the north and south have a basis, and the main force has been fighting fiercely for more than a month, and the communist army has suffered 80,000 to 90,000 casualties. It can be said that a lot of the credit should be attributed to these densely packed steel-concrete bunkers, large and small. With the above-mentioned advantages, coupled with Mr. Ge Xishan's determination to "be buried in Taiyuan," it is possible to have Taiyuan's superior anti-bandit war record today, which is different from other major cities. However, the communist bandits are determined to capture Taiyuan. There have long been rumors that the communist bandits are preparing to make Taiyuan their "capital" and plan to convene a so-called "New Political Consultative Conference" in Taiyuan, using all possible military, civilian, and financial resources to capture Taiyuan. However, the military, civilian, and financial resources of the National Army in Taiyuan are limited, even if they are exhausted. How to reinforce troops and supply materials has become an urgent task that cannot be delayed, otherwise, even if you intend to provide assistance, you may feel that it is too late.</p>
<p>Zhangjiakou, the Oasis Beyond the Great Wall</p>
<p>By Our Newspaper Reporter Yue Zhan</p>
<p>[Airmail from Beiping, 17th of the Month] While viewing the red leaves in the Western Hills of Beiping, one can already see ice floating in the river in Zhangjiakou.</p>
<p>The first impression is always unfamiliar, but it is easy to see that this is a vibrant city. Their attitude towards life shows a seriousness towards work. Life is a very serious matter to them. They are not easily agitated, nor do they love extravagance. Women seem unaware of what lipstick is, and civil servants are all dressed in cotton clothes. A businessman wearing a greasy old sheepskin coat is considered wealthy. No one would dare to take a car to the cinema entrance. Such a simple city is indeed rare. People wearing suits and overcoats always feel uncomfortable here.</p>
<p>The World-Renowned Mushrooms</p>
<p>This simple style can be said to be a "local product," like the world-renowned mushrooms. Mushrooms are considered a rare delicacy once they leave Nankou, but they are nothing special locally. Zhangjiakou's mushrooms are sold all over the country, and everyone knows it. This product is produced in Chahar North and Inner Mongolia. Currently, Chahar North and Inner Mongolia are in turmoil, and the sources of all furs, livestock, and food have been cut off. Only this delicacy can continue to come because it is easy to carry and is not a necessity of life. There are more than 30 mushroom shops in Zhangjiakou. The best mushrooms sell for 48 yuan per catty, and the worst sell for 10 yuan per catty. Sales have been poor this year.</p>
<p>Dajingmen Cannot Bear the Vicissitudes of Time</p>
<p>The development of Zhangjiakou is based on trade with Outer Mongolia. It has had a golden age, but it is currently in recession. It is impossible to predict what will happen in the future. The historically famous location for Mongol-Han trade is Dajingmen, located in Zhangyuan Upper Town. It has now become a historical site. In the past, Mongolians brought cattle, sheep, and camels to exchange for cotton cloth, cigarettes, and tea. Now, batches of Mongolian refugees enter through this gate. Occasionally, a camel walks into Dajingmen, looking at the four characters "Great Rivers and Mountains" with sad little eyes, as well as the ancient Great Wall stretching on both sides, with the ruins of beacon towers on top. It must be filled with a sense of沧桑.</p>
<p>Currently, the number of Mongolian refugees who have fled to Zhangyuan has reached more than 800, most of whom are destitute and all need relief. In addition, there are more than 2,000 people scattered in various counties in Zhangbei. Mi Zhuodezhang Nongbu Ningbu, the 14-year-old little prince of Ujumqin Right Banner, also recently fled to Zhangyuan and transferred to Beiping on the 10th of this month. This little prince is very fond of Peking Opera.</p>
<p>Cultural Liberation</p>
<p>Zhangjiakou's culture is a bit like "liberated feet," and it can never get rid of its original appearance in terms of form and content. Ping Opera is the most popular in Zhangjiakou. When Mr. Fu Zuoyi returns to Zhangyuan, he also likes to go to listen to opera with his old comrades. Zhangjiakou's Fendou New Village and Fendou Middle School are the residences for the families of Mr. Fu's subordinates and schools for their children. They have a socialist color and a family-centric spirit. There are four newspapers in Zhangjiakou: Fendou Daily, Minsheng Daily, Commercial Daily, and Chahar Daily, with a total circulation of 5,600 copies. Zhangyuan has a population of 170,000, averaging one newspaper for every 30 people. Although Zhangjiakou's culture suffers from anemia, it is still an oasis in the desert wilderness.</p>
<p>A City with a Sense of Numbers</p>
<p>Zhangyuan is a city with a sense of numbers. Police Chief Yin Yanying told me many things as if counting family treasures: how many people, how many industries, how much movable property the people have, and how much immovable property. In the police station's two small rooms, there are statistics on everything about people and things, detailed and without omission. A chart shows that 90% of the 200 prostitutes are healthy.</p>
<p>A small matter can illustrate the completeness of Zhangyuan's organizational spirit. As soon as I got off the bus, the police were most concerned about me. They asked me where I planned to stay. After registering, military police visited me in the evening.</p>
<p>Jiangsu Province is Approved to Transport Rice and Grain Collected as Tax in Kind from Wuhu</p>
<p>[Reported from Zhenjiang, the 19th] The collection of tax in kind in various counties of Jiangsu Province has been initiated one after another. In order to strengthen supervision and guidance and complete the task within three months, the Provincial Department of Grain and Food has specially dispatched inspectors Wu Yisan, Wang Zhidao, and others to Song, Su, Xi, Chang, and other counties to supervise the collection. Wu and others departed from Zhenjiang on the 19th.</p>
<p>[Additional Report] The Ministry of Grain has telegraphed the Jiangsu Provincial Department of Grain and Food, stating that it has telegraphed the Anhui Provincial Government and the Eighth Pacification Zone to approve the shipment of 50,000 shi of rice purchased by Zhen, Xi, Chang, Tong, and other counties in Wuhu. This batch of rice will arrive within days.</p>
<p>[Additional Report] According to news from the Department of Civil Affairs, the work of banning opium in various counties in southern Jiangsu Province this year is centered on investigation and suppression, and all opium will be completely eliminated by the end of this year.</p>

<p>The White Lotus Sect's Legacy Spreads to Yiguandao</p>
<p>A Major Case Cracked in Southern Sichuan</p>
<p>[Airmail from Chengdu, the 20th] A large-scale organization called Yiguandao was recently cracked in Wutongqiao, southern Sichuan. A month ago, Chang Zhenzhong and Gao Heguang from Hebei entered Sichuan from Beiping and established altars in various parts of the province, recruiting young men and women and unemployed vagrants to join the sect. They went to Wutongqiao and used the operation of the Mingde Trading Company to promote Yiguandao. The sect's tenets falsely claim to promote the three cardinal guides and five constant virtues and entice young people to join the sect. The rituals are secret, and both men and women must swear naked oaths and pay huge membership fees. For a time, ignorant men and women and unemployed vagrants were deceived and flocked to it. Last month, the police station arrested the "sect leaders" Chang Zhenzhong, Gao Heguang, and Tian Zhi, and seized "Yiguandao Pulse Diagrams" and other related documents. After strict interrogation by the special commissioner, it was discovered that the sect purely inherited the legacy of the White Lotus Sect and had slogans suspected of inciting anti-rebellion and various bizarre symbols. The sect established branches in various places, and special personnel from Beiping came to guide them by plane, which shows the size of its organization. The special commissioner is currently investigating the case in detail and has reported it to the Sichuan Provincial Government for review.</p>

<h3 id="e79">Yesterday's Commemoration by All Sectors: Ninth Air Defense Day <a href="#e79" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c79" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">79</a></h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Report] Yesterday was the Ninth Air Defense Day. At 10:00 AM, all sectors of this city held a commemoration meeting at the Queen's Grand Theater. The presidium included Wu Guozhen, Pan Gongzhan, Fang Zhi, Zhao Zukang, Li Ximou, and other representatives from various sectors, totaling over a thousand people. Wang Weimin, Commander of the Air Force Supply Command, was also invited to attend. At the beginning of the meeting, Mayor Wu gave a speech stating: Thanks to the dedication of the soldiers on the front lines and the efforts of the Air Force in the Xuzhou battle, the National Army has a grasp on victory. At this time of global unrest, aviation and air defense are extremely important. As this city is located on a plain, in terms of air defense, I believe that passively, we should popularize air defense knowledge and expand firefighting; actively, we should build a strong air force. Speaker Pan then gave a speech, believing that air defense should start from the active aspect, and the people should actively contribute to assisting the government in building the Air Force. In peacetime, there should be training and preparation. Chairman Fang gave a speech stating that the commemoration of Air Defense Day should be to thank the Air Force soldiers for their loyalty and bravery. Fang also denounced the wealthy merchants who fled abroad. Commander Wang Weimin then expressed his gratitude to all sectors for their respect to the Air Force, and said: To build the Air Force, (1) those with money should contribute money, (2) scientists should devote themselves to the research of aviation science, and (3) young people with aspirations should dedicate themselves to the Air Force. As for air defense in this city, in addition to increasing equipment, the public should be organized and trained. Finally, Mayor Wu temporarily moved to send a telegram in the name of the meeting to the Air Force in various places to express respect. Then, slogans were shouted, a film was shown, and the meeting adjourned.</p>
<h3 id="e80">Second Phase of Jewelry Bond Charity Sale to Continue as Ordered by the Ministry of Finance; First Phase Lottery to Be Held Next Month on the 10th <a href="#e80" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c80" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">80</a></h3>
<p>It is reported that the China Trust Bureau submitted a request to the Ministry of Finance to temporarily suspend the second phase of seized property jewelry bonds due to excessive price fluctuations. Recently, the bureau received a response from the Ministry of Finance, stating that the number of seized jewelry was very large, making public sale inconvenient, and bidding also had technical difficulties. It was still appropriate to continue issuing charity bonds to strengthen the settlement and assist the government in absorbing idle funds. Therefore, the Central Trust Bureau, the Enemy and Puppet Property Clearance Office, and the Central Savings Society have begun preparing for the issuance of the second phase. The bond design for the second phase is also being designed, and will be slightly different from the first phase. The face value of the second phase of charity bonds was originally set at one yuan per bond, but now, due to rising prices, a one-yuan face value is inevitably too low. According to reports, the face value may be increased to ten yuan per bond. However, this matter is being submitted to the Executive Yuan for approval by the issuing authorities and is expected to be finalized within the month. The number of bonds issued will also be increased, and the issuance date may be in mid-next month.</p>
<p>In addition, the Central Trust Bureau will hold the lottery for the first phase of jewelry charity bonds on the original scheduled date, the 10th of next month.</p>

<p>According to Zhou Zhaoxiang, director of the Fire Department of the Police Bureau, based on past records, fire alarms will gradually increase from this month onwards. Because the north wind has risen, the weather is cold, and citizens are sleepy and negligent, disasters often occur due to unextinguished coal stoves or cigarette butts thrown everywhere. In addition to strengthening the firefighting force, the department recently recruited dozens of fire policemen, established a perfect control room, and plans to purchase wireless command fire trucks. It will also loudly appeal to raise public awareness of fire disasters.</p>

<p>The preferential purchase certificates for public educators sponsored by the Executive Yuan's Materials Supply Bureau have now entered November. Most public educators have not yet purchased the October point purchase certificates. The bureau has decided to focus on selling them. As of now, the bureau has completed the investigation of the total number of October point purchase certificates of all institutions, and is adding a large number of materials to the designated contracted sales stores. Starting this week, the bureau may separately notify various public education institutions to take their October allotment certificates to the designated locations for purchase. However, the bureau is still considering adjusting the allotment price. Because the Executive Yuan has recently decided to increase the salaries of public educators by five times according to the "819" plan, the corresponding point value may be increased from 25 cents to 50 cents per point.</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper Report] Municipal middle school teachers and staff can cancel their leave and resume teaching from today. Municipal primary schools are still awaiting a decision at a meeting this afternoon.</p>
<p>The Municipal Primary and Secondary School Teachers' Federation jointly telegraphed the Executive Yuan and the Legislative Yuan yesterday, calling out that their lives were on the verge of hunger and cold, with no firewood or rice left, and they were in a state of anxiety all day long. In addition to asking the Legislative Yuan to insist on the original proposal passed on the 16th of this month to adjust the salaries of public educators and urging the Executive Yuan to implement it as soon as possible, they also asked the Executive Yuan to quickly implement it in accordance with the original proposal passed by the Legislative Yuan in order to relieve their distress and maintain education. The original telegram to the Executive Yuan is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>To Premier Weng and Deputy Premier Zhang of the Executive Yuan, and to all the Executive Commissioners: Since the financial and economic reforms and the cancellation of price limits, prices have risen like wild horses out of control, rising day and night. Compared with the time of "8.19", they have risen by more than twenty times, while the salaries of us public educators have only been increased by half, and a month's income is only worth two or three bushels of white rice. This small amount is difficult for individuals to even have enough to eat, let alone support their families. We have been in the education sector for many years and have always had a spirit of dedication, sticking to our posts and striving to serve. Now, there is no firewood or rice left, and we are about to run out of food, and we are in a state of anxiety all day long. Fortunately, the members of the Legislative Yuan have seen this situation and decided on the 16th of this month to adjust the salaries of public educators, consulting the Executive Yuan for implementation, which shows their deep concern and gratitude. Although the adjustment plan cannot completely solve the problem of life, it can alleviate the difficulties. It is rumored that the Executive Yuan can only partially accept the plan and will formulate another plan for handling it. After reading it, the masses are extremely panicked. According to the current situation, we are already on the verge of hunger and cold. It is already incomprehensible that the Executive Yuan did not formulate a plan and adjust it before the resolution of the Legislative Yuan. It is even more incomprehensible that it did not fully accept it after the resolution of the Legislative Yuan was delivered, which violates the principle that the constitutional cabinet must be responsible to the Legislative Yuan. If this is delayed in such a manner, where will it place our lives? We hope that what is being reported is not accurate. We urgently hope that the Executive Yuan will implement it in accordance with the case as soon as possible in order to relieve our distress and maintain education. We are extremely anxious and awaiting orders.</p>

<p>The board of directors of the Municipal Primary School Principals' Association held a meeting at the Municipal Bide Primary School yesterday to discuss the issue of the teachers and staff of the Capital Teachers Union requesting leave. They all believed that the conference of the association had already resolved to ask teachers and staff to postpone their leave. Now that the Municipal Government has been able to allocate wool and other materials with great difficulty, and the remaining oil, coal, and other materials will be distributed after settling the price, the Mayor has also promised to issue three dou of allocated rice for December in advance. On the salary side, the Municipal Government is awaiting an order from the Executive Yuan to raise funds. Municipal middle school teachers and staff have also decided to start classes on Monday. This association should still follow the resolution of the conference and have each principal encourage teachers and staff to cancel their leave starting on Monday. This is also in line with the resolution of the teachers and staff association to follow the example of the municipal middle schools. Therefore, it was decided that each principal should encourage teachers and staff in their member schools to attend classes on Monday. As for the adjustment of salaries and the issue of the allocation of wool, this association will continue to contact the authorities. The meeting adjourned at about 12:00 PM.</p>

<p>Recently, more than 10,000 tons of Soviet coal have been transported to this city, and more than 30,000 tons will continue to be shipped to Shanghai one after another. The above-mentioned large amount of coal was purchased by the Shangban Coal Transport Association. In addition to Soviet coal, coal from Taiwan, Kailuan, and Huainan has also been ordered and is currently being transported. It is reported that in order to alleviate the coal shortage for public utilities, the municipal authorities have ordered the transport association to allocate a portion of the coal to public utilities. In addition, the Public Utilities Bureau previously submitted a proposal to the Energy Conservation Movement Committee on energy conservation measures, implementing the "three go to one" movement. After the Energy Conservation Committee invited various relevant parties to exchange opinions, the Public Utilities Bureau revised it and resubmitted it to the committee. It is now known that because the source of coal has become smoother than before and the severity of the coal shortage has improved, the Public Utilities Bureau does not intend to implement the "three go to one" energy conservation measure. However, it hopes that citizens can still voluntarily conserve electricity to reduce the power generation load of the power company.</p>
