<p>決建議國府請重加考慮</p>
<p>〔本報南京廿六日電〕監察院廿六日晟舉行談話會，苗培成主席，對公敎人員改善待遇事，右所討論，于樹德等當提議，新訂之公教人員待遇調整辦法，乃係三月調整一次，日將實物配售制取消，事實上，第一月所得或較以前依薪水倍數，生活費及實物配售差額金三項總和稍多，第二月即毫無增加可能，較以前差額金增加後猶少，第三月更勿論矣，故新訂之公敎人員待遇調整辦法，如取消實物配售，公敎人員反而吃虧，此決非監院等機關力爭改善公教人員待遇之初衷，故主張建議指數應每月調整，俾符生活指數之名，否則實物配售制度應予保留，以維公敎人員生活，當經各委員一致贊同，決定將此項意見作成正式建議書，呈請國府重加考慮。</p>

<p>〔本報南京廿六日電〕國民黨第七屆全國代表大會延期召開，已由廿六日中常會討論決定。去年四中全會曾決議七全代會於卅七年五月五日舉行，按照規定應在會期前三個月發出通知，中常會今提出討論時，認爲時間迫促，籌備不及，決定改期，惟延至何日尙未決定。關於國代選舉對友黨之退讓及本黨同志之互讓問題。中常會廿六日再度提出討論，並決定交選舉小組再加硏究。</p>
<p>〔本報南京廿六日電〕國代名單之公布問題及簽署提名國代當選人之常選資格問題，廿六日在中常會提出討論甚久，尙未獲得結論，根據統計，中央提名而獲得當選者達總額百分之七十五，尙餘百分之廿五落選。簽署提名者以票數計，自當膺選，但格於國務會議選舉補充條例之規定，故其當選資格終無法確定。同時對讓與友黨辦法再作討論，亦未獲得結論，決定於廿七日午後召開綜合小組，將名單提出硏討後，再送中常會作最後之決定。又聞民·靑兩黨人士，均堅持原提候選人之名額，靑年黨即提出「黨讓黨包總額」即非某個人讓與之問題，而是國民黨讓與友黨之問題，故在任何情形之下，必須讓與兩黨，同時如在甲地確係萬不得已，而不能當選，則須於乙地由國民黨人士退出讓與友黨，則其總數常仍不變。民·靑兩黨並對公布當選人名單一事，表示必須由兩黨人士同意後，始可發表，否則不予承認，此項問題均待廿七日會中再行討論。</p>

<h3 id="c22">趕快召開對日和會！ <a href="#c22" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e22" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">22</a></h3>
<p>自美陸軍方面提出要求以五億元援助日本後，繼之又有美國向華府遠東十一國委員會提出之長薦說牒，陳述扶助日本自給自足之必要，請各盟國予以贊同。此項消息傳出後，我們雖尙未曾接獲充分情報，藉以得知一般盟國的態度，然在我們中國，遭受日本的侵略，歷時旣久，為害尤烈，我們對於麥帥管制日本的寬容政策，旣曾表示陰慮，而今又有此項消息，自然更表不安。華府的遠東十一國委員會對此作何計議，我們不必追究；站在中國的立塲，對日和約旣未簽訂，而今又有進一步的援日表示，於情於理，似覺終有未合。美國對日之慷慨，顯已超出一戰勝國對一尙具有敵對地位的國家所應施予的範圍。因此，我們認為無論對戰後日本採取什麼政策，它的一個先決問題，便在對日和會得召開與對日和約的簽訂。趕快召開對日和會，應是我們目前努力的鵠的。</p>
<p>本來，關於對日和約預備會議召開問題，在中美英蘇四國文書往遠之間，波澜軍重，險象橫生，近來別顯已到了僵持的局面。如果這個僵局不能打開，勢必造成盟國的分裂。看目前種種的跡象，僵局是難於打開的。美蘇各有打算，祗有我們中國在兩極夾攻中，是孤立徘徊着。政府苦悶，外交上顯得沒有聲光；人民煩躁，儘管宣言座談，也缺少奧援。但無論如何，我們總得謀求僵局的打開，以便趕快召開對日和會。</p>
<p>現在，我們先檢討中美英蘇四國的態度。四國對日本和會程序問題的態度，從來就是不一致的，彼此問的分歧，至少已有三種不同的意見。</p>
<p>英美是一種意見。美國意見於一九四七年八月提出，迄今尙無改變或修正。美國對日本和會程序，主張由參加遠東委員會得十一國共同　會起草和約，以三分之二多數決來表决。這個主張的關鍵是廢除否決權，並反對以外長會議作商討對日和約的程序。英國於坎伯拉會議後，取決國態度是一致　，尤其澳大利亞的態度表現積極。蘇聯兩次主張由四國外長會議起草對日和約的提議，英國先後拒絕了，而且拒絕的態度，一次嚴峻一次。現在遠東委員會又將加入巴基斯坦和緬甸兩國，這很顯然地說明了：英美想在程序上以多數取得優勢，在實質上廢除四國一致的原則。</p>
<p>蘇聯是一種意見。蘇聯拒絕美國原先的提議，牠主張中美英蘇四國外長會議擔負起草對日和約的責任，在程序上保留否決權。蘇聯的目的，想以外長會議的存在，成為全世界製造和約的機構，並以否決權的武器，抵抗英美陣綫外交的優勢。一九四七年十一月廿八日，蘇聯答覆中國通牒，同意中國建議表示一切對日和約之決定必須以中美蘇英四國代表之同意，但牠强調預備會議之前，四强應在中國舉行一次外長會議，討論對日和會的籌備事項。十二月五日，我國外交部長又照會蘇聯，聲明應由遠東委員會担任對日和約之起草，希望蘇聯同意中國的折衷案。十二月三十日，蘇外長莫洛托夫答覆我照會，幷未改變以前的主張，惟對遠東委員會四國除外的其他會員國，主張參加對日和會可能設立的各委員會及小組委員會工作，這很顯然地說明了：蘇聯主張的對日和會程序，是四國外長會議，對日和約的起草祇有外長會議有種準備。</p>
<p>在兩派意見之外，中國是折衷的，中間性的。中國意見，外交部曾有改變，最後當以一九四七年十一月十七日向美應蘇通牒內容為準，其中建議分兩項：　由遠東委員會會員國組成對日和約預備會議，該會議應由中美英蘇商定日期，予以召開，藉以起草和平條約，並商決與召開最後和平會議有關事項；　該會議之表决，以該會議會員國之多數為之，但在該項多數內須包括中美英蘇四國之同意票。這個主張的關鍵，是維持遠東委員會的組織精神，並保留否決權而以維護「一致同意」原則為前提。所以說，中國意見是美英蘇歧見的調和，也可說是上述兩派意見的修正。英國對中國建議，兩次表示拒絕的態度，蘇聯與中國建議相同點，是否決權的保留，但四國與十一國的問題，中蘇的意見仍有相當距離。</p>
<p>在這三種分歧意見中，英美是一致，中蘇則各自孤立而又不完全一致。這是對日和約預備會議陷於僵局的關鍵。中國在這中間，蘇聯旣不肯慨然奧援，另方面，又枉自討荚美的厭棄，儘管自己以為道主張有堂堂之旗　正正之鼓，但終仍不免於孤立。政府和人民同感苦悶，外交上更顯不出聲光。</p>
<p>中國的與論，呼　美英蘇運用智懸，放大眼光，覓求妥協，聲音是洪亮的，但得不到分毫的回響。事實上，英美蘇三國的政治家，胸有成竹，各有打算。聯合國大會套亂遠東各項問題（尤其是朝鲜問題），以及遼東經濟會議的討論，蘇聯對遠東的態度，很明白表現牠不願在英美陣綫外交優勢下低首下來，對於任何問題的態度，都是不合作的。對日和約在蘇聯看來，其關係也很重大，在今天的形勢下，對日和會愈延宕，則愈對蘇聯有利；一個無蘇聯參加的對日和會，蘇聯的態度將愈自由愈便利。至於美英兩國呢，如果得不到蘇聯合作，對日和會也是要召開的；以目前美國管制日本的趨勢看，單獨對日回復和平狀態，不訂任何和約，也是可能的事。雖然這不是常規的終結戰爭的方式，但在歷史上不乏先例。一八六七年法蘭西與墨西哥的戰爭即如此終局；而第一次世界大戰美德戰爭之告終，便是美總統於一九二一年七月裁可兩院之決議，宣言恢復對德和平的。美國單獨對日　和的可能是有的，現在所以未如此作，一方面因為蘇聯的和會攻勢尙未至頂點，另方面是　期待在對華有利的情勢下，完全爭取得中國，如果中國堅持「不參加無蘇聯之和會」，則美國被迫而對日單獨講和是萬分可能的。看斯揣克反賠慣論的抬頭，明白表　美國祗要日本鳥　，不需要日本的賠償。看日本對和約反要求的秘密計謀，祗要不賭償或少賠償，從　讓　　也無妨，所以更令人相信美日單獨講和的可能性。假如美國這樣作，英國不會反對。澳大利亞菲律賓所爭的，是少數德賠償，問題並不嚴重。</p>
<p>在這個惡劣的情勢下，中國的處境最慘了。無論我們如何巧於　　，也不能「免乎累」的。事宜上，中國是不能單獨對日講和的；其一，單獨講和很難享有戰勝國的權利，一九一九年八月中國單獨對德媾和，但是顯明的實例。其二，中國有一九四五年八月「中蘇友好同盟條約」的拘束，雙方不得單獨對日媾和，並訂軍事同盟。所以在中國的立塲，應該是希望對日和約預備會議僵局的打開，是不願見盟國分裂，或美國單獨對日媾和的。因此，我們希望美國睿智的政治家，為重建遠東和平負起責任，打開目前的僵局，循取下述兩條路徑之一：</p>
<p>一，接受中國的折衷建議，維持和會的四國一致同意的原則；</p>
<p>二，召開四國外長會議，作商談對日和約內容的嘗試，如四國實質上能協調，最後再解決遠東十一國的正式對日和會議問題。</p>
<p>除此之外，僵局是不能打開的；延續下去對盟國的合作是不利的。我們不願見歐洲險惡的風雲重演於遠東，尤不願日本在這美蘇矛盾中，坐收和約反要求之利。今天的形勢，對日本最有利英美跳，蘇聯抝，中國惱，日本笑！如果「日本失敗於戰爭，勝利於和平」，那纔是同盟國戰略上政略上全盤的輸局啊！</p>

<p>梁子青談晋京洽商經過</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕天津市府秘書長梁子青氏，為解決天津糧食問題，本年元且自津過滬晋京，迭與中樞各關係當局接洽商談，刻已公畢，日前自京來滬，定日內返津，昨特接見本市新聞界，對平津地方情形及經濟現狀叙述頗詳，茲摘誌粱氏談話大要如次：</p>
<h3 id="c27">提供四大原則 <a href="#c27" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e27" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">27</a></h3>
<p>此次晋京主要任務，為向中樞貢獻解決天津糧食之四大原則，附帶任務，為協助華北請願團，向中樞提供救濟華北經濟之五項建議。解決天津糧食之四大原則，一為設法自力更生，請求中樞貸款，俾至西北各地購買雜糧，現估計西北雜糧餘額約為一萬噸，而平津兩地每月各需一萬七千噸，故即使五萬噸全部購足，亦僅足敷十津糧食二月之需。二為請求擴大長江區麵粉轉口限額，最好取銷限額制。三衛爭取由美救濟協定中十一萬五千噸糧食，對平津分配之比率，關於此點，接洽已有結果，分配委會繆主委，已允撥出麵粉五萬噸，救濟平津。四為天津擬以出口物資易取國外糧食。</p>
<h3 id="c28">中樞兩項措施 <a href="#c28" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e28" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">28</a></h3>
<p>接洽經過：糧食方面，中樞應急措置，決在舊歷年前，先運麵粉卅萬袋至津，經常措置，決自本年二月份起，每月分配天津麵粉五十萬袋（公敎人員配額除外），又對長江區之雜糧，允予無限制北運，國行張總裁且已允許津滬購糧槪予平匯，至南粉北運，每袋收許可費十五萬元之事，糧部決予澈查。</p>

<p>天津為解決糧食問題，擬請在津局部試行進出口聯銷制，以天津輸出之猪鬃，胡桃，大豆，花生，腸衣，駝毛等，易取必需之糧食。估計上項出口物資，在正常情狀下，每季可得美匯一千萬元，此款至少可輸入五萬三千噸麵粉，已可解決天津四五兩月之糧荒問題。目前因輸入物資須自黑市購取，而出口又以官價結匯，故每季輸出僅約美金二百萬元，如能局部實現進出口聯鎖制，旣可解決天津糧食問題，每季又可為國家多獲美匯八百萬元。同時為顧及中央管制外匯及統籌支配之原則，建議特別結匯辦法，惟國行張總裁終以全國各區，均有外匯收入，未能因天津局部試行，而形成分割局面，且進出口聯鎖後，必致進口增加，出口物資增價，造成美鈔黑市猖獗，故認為無從考慮</p>

<p>— 虜談話</p>
<p>〔本報東京通信〕二次世界大戰早已過去了，但是當年日本投降過程中的重要一頁，驕悍蠻橫的「關東軍」怎樣會很快地解體，却一眞似謎般的為世人所揣測着，最近有一批從西伯利亞遺送返日的關東軍俘虜到了東京，記者會和他　　　　，從他們的口中道出了當時情景，雖已成明日黃花，却仍有一記、價值，下面就是他們的談話：</p>
<p>當德國向聯合軍宣佈投降後（一九四五廿四月），蘇聯極秘密的開始運輸他　軍隊到遠東來，到了七月中旬，形勢境出特殊　緊張，西伯利亞鐵路公然的進入戰時輸送狀態，滿洲邊境一帶情勢一日日的吃緊，雖然從前諾曼哈登日蘇衝突事件之發生，蘇聯從未集結這樣强大的兵力，其中兵器，彈藥，糧秣，機材等約五年的作戰費材，蘇聯在這種數月內，已經完成他國境要衝集結的計劃。</p>
<p>蘇班島日軍全員覆沒，冲繩島經上陸，太平洋美軍更熾烈的進攻，為了日本本土守備備　准備在東北的關東軍情銳　隊，不斷　向朝鮮日本轉移，他我們　兵力大兩减少，但是對蘇聯攻擊的準備，我們全員抱着玉碎的精神，各兵團在興安嶺——穆稄——老松嶺——敦化一綫，積極構築新的防禦工程，同時利用山獄地帶，日夜不斷逐步建設低下工塲，作長期防禦之準備。</p>
<p>八月八日，第×軍正面（半戴河）附近，蘇聯乓約二百不法越境，我軍因未得上峯命令，敌暫　撤退。八月九日早晨，第五軍正面虛頭福建，雙方進入交戰狀態，同時軍司令都不斷按報，海拉爾，琿春，東寗等各地蘇軍開始進攻，繼續的哈爾濱，奉天，公主嶺等的主要都市空襲轟炸開始，從這天起，一向被認為安全地帶的中國東北，竟不幸的進入交戰區域。</p>
<p>然而從兵力的比較，蘇聯這時遠東軍有百五十萬，而我方僅祗半數約七十萬（三十四個師團和九個旅團），蘇聯擁有五千以上的飛機，而我方僅五百架，其中三百架尙柱進行修理，故實用者僅二百架，並且蘇聯戰車約五百台，而我們僅一聯隊的戰車部隊</p>
<p>我們的精銳部隊大半已轉移本國，所留的都是四十歲左右老弱的補充兵，故各兵團唯有留守自己的陣地，很惶恐狼狽的等待蘇軍之攻擊。蘇聯攻擊重點是想把整個「滿洲」包圍，在機械化部隊及優秀的空軍協力下，全境作扇形的急攻，故戰後僅數日，已有到遠東春的形勢。同時北部朝鮮方面，蘇聯海軍更活躍的進行上陸戰。</p>
<p>當時凡軍事，政治，交通中心的都市，幾全被空襲，「滿洲」各軍政要人紛紛後退疏散，偽滿洲傀儡皇帝溥儀在軍部護送下，八月十三日由長春出發之宮廷專車南下，十四日到達通化；駐在某煤礦社長之私宅，這時東邊道已在日夜建築地下皇宮。</p>
<p>這種轟炸，惶恐，疏散，混亂等慘狀，實為歷史上所罕見，同時長春各地散佈着奇怪的謠言是　日本已經向聯合軍司令部停戰請求　偽滿之外交方面，已經暗中與蘇聯進行講和條約</p>
<p>八月十五日，　綫電投降消息廣播，但我們還未接獲司令部之命命，仍舊進行着戰鬥行動，而司令部召集緊急會議，慎重協議今後軍部之行動，當時主要和戰者都有，但是主戰者多數，結果主腦部完全消滅停戰意志，在外三軍司令部（中國派遣軍，南洋派遣軍及關東軍）同時向各處發出强硬的通電：認為将兵士氣盛旺，中樞部意志固强，抱着王碎精神，克服困難關鍵，徹底殲滅英美。並且軍部少壯參謀連方面持下三點理由激勵屬下：　軍人國民應該依楠公盡忠報國的精神敎育，絕對不允许三千年來日本光榮的歷史沾上了投降的污點，東亞各地必戰至最後一兵一卒。　和平詔書非天皇本意，實乃君側奸臣之偽作，急速派機回京除奸。　日本本土二百五十萬精神防禦軍，於優秀時備下待機中，必與英美作一痛快之殲滅戰</p>
<p>在這主戰强調極度喧擾不安的會議中，關東軍林參謀總長與司令官山田乙三大將泣訴屬下：「服從皇令是軍人天職，希部下將兵遵守御勅諭，停止戰鬥行動，急速解除武裝。」</p>
<p>八月十七日，各兵團戰鬥意識仍極盛吒，芳有傳達投降命令之將　，被認為『蘇聯之大』而一刀斬殺，至十八日戰鬥行動才漸中止。</p>
<p>駐留車邊道之偽滿帝溥儀　軍部「稟知」停戰協定及請示今後行動之「聖意」，溥儀認為居住日本為佳，故當急護衛至　天機塲，準備搭機飛日，但只差一時，蘇聯戰鬥機數十架已在同飛機塲着陸，其後湧儀則由蘇軍護衛，而我等亦徑解除武裝，嘗試暗無天日的敗戰生活，過着西伯利亞俘虜勞働日子了。（陳洛）</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕倫敦廿六日廣播：巴黎訊，法總理許曼今日告國民議會稱，爲使全國工廠開工及防止失業，法郞貶值實屬必要。按國民議會今日開始辯論法郞貶值問題，決定如何，影響遠大</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社巴黎廿五日電〕法國政府廿五日發表聲明，宣布法郞之官定新匯率與外匯之自出買賣，並解釋其不得不採取此稱步驟。聲明中稱，「法國政府前爲達成其穩定經濟之目標起兄，曾實施反通貨膨賬措施，今日所採取之步驟，已使此等措旅完成外匯率之調整顯屬必要。」按法國政府初時頗爲躊躇，不能決定其應否　將法郞貶值，抑或採取較　彈性之方案，但最後仍放棄前一辦法，因法政府認爲在此時即訂定一能滿足一切需要之固定匯率，尚嫌渦早。匯率過低，將不能達到穩定經濟之目標，匯率過高則將使法國經濟遭受妨碍。法政府之聲明又稱，「欲使外匯取得其自然之平衡，自由買賣之過渡時期實爲必要，法政府深信其所採取之行動，不致妨碍其他國家，爲達成同一自標而作之努力。國際貨幣基金會議雖批准法國計畫中的重要部分，但拒絕批准整個計畫，法政府對此極感遺憾。法國政府準備採取技術上措施，並實行互相配合之管制辦法，以免其他貨幣不能兌換之國家感覺不安。」</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社巴黎廿五日電〕法政府廿五日晚發表聲明稱，法外匯平準基金處，已規定法郞之新匯率，計一美元合二一四·三九二法郞，一英鎊合八六四法郞。法政府所宣布採取之步驟有二：即　法外匯平準基金處自一月廿六日起將法郞外匯率放長百分之八十，法國法郞對法郞區內其他幣制之匯價照舊不變，法國盧比對美元及英鎊之匯率亦仍保持原價。　除官定匯價之外，外匯並可自由買賣，其條例如下：（甲）法貨外銷所得之外匯，半數以官價售與外匯平準基金處，半數可在自由市塲中出售，其他如貿易差額所結存之外匯，流入法國之外國資金，以及外國旅法人士持有之外匯，亦均可在自由市塲中出售。（乙）自由買賣所得之外匯，可用以償付進口貨物，但其他爲法國經濟所必要之進口貨物，則以官價結匯。（丙）自由市塲中外匯之貿賣價格，應視供求之多寡任其漲落。</p>
<p>〔路透社倫敦廿五日電〕據巴黎倫敦宣布，英法將立即開始技術合作，以减少對英鎊區與法郞區間關係所引起的反響。法國並聲明此次官布之措施，非永久性者，僅爲趨向規定法郞統一匯率的一種步驟而已。</p>

<p>〔聯合社倫敦廿六日電〕證券市塲政府公債今日突然下跌，人心惶惶，對於英鎊前途殊難估價，此間大多數報紙認爲英鎊將瀕危境。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社倫敦廿五日電〕倫敦金融界一般人士認爲法政府所決定之幣制改革，直接違反勃萊頓森林國際貨幣協定。據稱，「法國政府採取此種行動，將爲其他國家創一危險的前例，足以促成國際貨幣之混亂狀態。法國政府對於其國內之金融市塲，恐亦將無力控制。法政府放長法郞之匯率，是否將使存儲國外之資金流返本國，仍極可疑，此稱方法足以引起更多之非法買賣。金　雖仍不能在法國自由市塲中買賣，但英鎊對美元之價值，由於非法買賣之增加，勢必仍將降低。法國物價本較世界一般物價高出百分之四十，今外匯放長，法國即能以低價將貨物傾銷美元區，當此英法兩國日益需要簽訂經濟及政治協定之時，法國政府採取此種措施實屬遺憾。」</p>
<p>〔路透社倫敦廿五日電〕據路透社財政記者甘培爾稱：英國表示反對的主要理由，不在恐懼出口將因法郞之貶值而减少，而在恐懼英鎊將受法國自由市塲之妨碍。英國及他國並不恐懼其出口之將减少。</p>

<p>〔法國新聞社華盛頓廿五日電〕國際貨幣基金會議總幹事葛特發表聲明稱，「國際貨幣基金會對於法國所提金融措施，不能完全贊同，但今後將繼緻與法國合作，以使該國最後能改變其決議。本會認爲法國確有調整法郎郞外匯率之必要，且準備與法國合作，俾法郞貶值後之匯率能切合實際。法國政府上月爲穩定國內幣制計，決定在財政及預算方面採取新步驟，本會對此甚爲滿意。至於外匯自由買賣一議，本會曾研究一切可能之代替方法，但對法國政府擬准許法貨外銷所得之外匯，在自由市塲出售一點，終感覺難以贊同。</p>
<p>此舉不但將使本會會員國家蒙受不利影響，並且亦非爲法國經濟之穩定所必要。本會深恐其他國家亦將因此競相抑低其本身之幣值，致使貿易脫離正軌。本會固知法國局勢甚爲嚴重，但認爲解決法在乎共同努力維持幣值之穩定而安全之水準。今法國政府決定不顧本會之反對，而實施其計劃，本會甚感遺憾。本會仍將與法國合作，覓致此種外匯制度之代替辦法，以在國際貨幣協定之範圍內，滿足法國之需要」。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社華盛頓廿五日電〕國際貨幣基金會議總幹事葛特今日招待新聞記者時宣稱，吾人對於法郞貶值，不應太爲激動，基金會議將不對法國取報復計劃，貶值之後果殊難預料。惟法政府此次曾以所擬取之一切步驟，坦直見告，殊堪令人滿意，葛特承認其他各國若不明瞭在法國自由貿易市塲上之同等地位，而因此取消與法國訂立之貿易協定，則將造成一複雜之局勢。且承認基金會議對此事之反對，大致與英國所作之反對相同，但拒絕表示是否由於英國之堅持而出此。葛氏宣稱，法國声明不在明年內基金團申請援助，且謂法國會保證此舉僅爲渦渡性質。</p>

<p>〔聯合社華成頓廿六日電〕法國不顧國際貨幣基金會之反對，實行法郞貶值，對於馬歇爾之援歐計劃，及法國在此項計劃下獲得援助一層，今日顯未發生影饗。惟此間一般人均認爲法國此舉，對於尚在襁褓中之基金會不免爲一重大打擊，且恐他國從而效尤。蓋基金會之設，即爲防止經濟戰爭，以免引起武力戰爭。美政府官員今日宣稱，美政府仍將進行目前之援法計劃，希望法與基金會能解決對此事之異見。</p>
<p>〔路透社華盛頓廿五日電〕權威方面透露：美國對於英國之反對法國建立外匯自由市塲，表示支持，美方且恐法國之制度，在國內不能獲致期望的效果，且將使今後數月內之政治關係愈趨惡化，卒至影響貝文「西歐聯盟」計劃之滿意發展，以及美國會就馬歇爾援歐方案之審查。英國如認法國之制度歧視對英貿易，可能對法採取報復性的貿易管制措施，一般人均盼英法間之網緻會談，能使西歐關係趨於改進。</p>

<p>我時常有機會在淸晨去見總統，那時候他還在床上。通常他已經起身過，用過早餐，再回到床上去處理一天中最初的工作。我發覺他的床上攤滿了報紙·文件·信札和電報。我就近拖一只椅子坐下，我們就開始討論手頭的問題。這種辦法，在我任職國務院的許多年中，是習以爲常的。</p>
<p>一般地說，我在社交方面並不是總統的密友。我並不被邀參加白宮的宴會（除了官方正式的宴會），或者乘坐羅斯福先生的游艇作週末旅行，或者赴海德公園。羅斯福尊重我的決心，就是我不願意分散我的精力於社交方面，而欲保存它們來處理公務。此外，我老實不歡喜被邀參加白宮中的團體，那裘時常玩着「自由主義」的把戲到極端的程度。</p>
<p>大家知道我並不是極端的自由主義者，也不是半激進主義者，好像若干接近總統的人那樣。我和他們聚在一起，對於我猶如對於他們一樣，是很難堪的。</p>
<p>在我覺得更富有意義的，就是有好許多次我單獨和總統舒適而寗靜地一起進餐，在這種情形之下，我們至少可以促膝而談一小時，不必咬文嚼字。</p>
<p>我和總統的母親薩拉·丹拉諾·羅斯福夫人的關係，是最誠懇的。依我看來，她是一個卓越的女子，已經把她的一切獻給了她的兒子和她的國家。我第一次知道她，乃是因爲聽說她時常支持我和我對於公務上的見解。她變成了我熱烈的熟悉的朋友，並且在我們的談話中，她對於國際問題和現狀，一直表現着廣泛的知識和精確的理解。</p>
<p>羅斯福夫人比我更左一點，我同她的接觸是極有限的，雖然已經能够使我欣賞她的能力。她是爭取和平的勇敢戰士，對於和平興其他人道工作，她在美國和其他國家中發揮了廣大的影響。</p>
<p>我相信總梳對我是完全坦白的；雖然我並不出席他純粹軍事性質的會議－除非討論的問題也牽涉外交的－或者內政會議，我從來不問他一個有關軍事或內政局勢最機密的問題，祗要他不立刻毫無保留地把全部詳情告訴我聽，我就此打住。我們有幾個大使，尤其是駐莫斯科其後駐巴黎的蒲立特，駐倫敦的坎納狄，駐莫斯科其後駐白魯塞爾的戴維斯，因爲他們都是總統的老友，時常越過了我直接寫信給總統，討論有關政策的重要問題。由大使和公使直接和總統通信，一向是不宜的，我曾就此點和羅斯福力爭過。但是雖然如此，我却想不起任何重大的實例，可以證明國務院的觀點和方針，曾因這稱行爲而受到重大的妨礙。</p>
<p>總統喜歡使用一種辦法，對於國務院往往是很爲難的，那就是以他的私人代表的資格，遺派特使到國外去和外國政府首長談話，或者履行某種任務。在這些特使中有霍普金，華萊士，哈里曼，赫爾利，社諾文，戴維斯諸人，他們都被派出去一次或二次。在許多情形之下，派這輩特使出去，往往在我國駐派在各該國的大使和公使中引起紛亂。然而，他們的任務極少干涉到政府嚴格屬於外交範圍之內的工作。</p>
<p>總統和我，時常商量任命國務院中我的重要助手以及駐派在國外的大使和公使。隨着時間的進展，總統對於這一類任命往往提出許多建議。但在極大多數情形之下，總是國務院向他建議，經過適當步驟之後，他就表示贊同，偶然有幾個例外而已。</p>
<p>他自已向我提出的建議，往往是簡明的，用鉛筆或者鋼筆寫在白宮小小的便條上，並沒有日期，往往像這個樣子：</p>
<p>「史密斯派重慶</p>
<p>「瓊斯派巴黎</p>
<p>「勃朗召回</p>
<p>「？」</p>
<p>在土耳其的首都從伊斯丹埠遷到安加拉之後，我收到他一張用鉛筆寫的便條：</p>
<p>「C．H．（Cordell　Hull的縮寫－譯者）</p>
<p>「爲什麼我們不可以把我們的大使館從伊斯丹埠遷移到安加拉呢？</p>
<p>「FDR」</p>
<p>（Franklin　Delano　Roosevelt之縮寫－者）</p>
<p>我就在底下用紅鉛筆寫道。「深表贊同。</p>
<p>「C．H．」</p>
<p>在羅斯福成爲總統之前，我一直稱呼他「富蘭克林」，其後，我就稱呼他「總統先生」，因爲有一個理由，就是我看見他的時候，他時常和別人在一起。但是甚至單是我們兩個人在一起的時候，我也稱呼他「總統先生」，雖然我們用呼銜頭的機會是極少的。他一直稱我「柯吉爾」，在出任總統之前和之後，始終如此。</p>
<p>總統祗到渦國務院一次。他到國務院來之前，先在上面一層樓上替他幾個「人家不知道他們名字的助手」找辦公室，找了好幾個鐘頭。</p>
<p>我向總統建議不止一次，主張他召請前總統胡佛來會商若干問題，諸如國外的糧食情形等。我自己從不猶豫和我的前任史汀生先生商量，我從他那裹獲得有價值的帮助，在貿易協定的立法方面尤然。但是總統和胡佛的關係已經變成很惡劣，結果前者從沒有邀請後者前往白宮。</p>
<p>我自己曾和胡佛非正式地商談過幾次，雖然不是正式在國務院商談的。遵照胡佛的建議我們的談話是在前副國務卿卡斯爾（Wlliiam　Castle）的家中舉行的，我就把商談內容報告總統。胡佛對於公家　務表示最熱烈的興趣。至於他對羅斯福極端的仇視是否使他政黨的氣味更激烈，我不能說。無論如何，這是一種相互的仇視。</p>
<p>若干具有極端左翼色彩的人時常挑撥總統對國務院的關係；並不是羅斯福先生本人對國務院有所爲難，而是少數具有左翼色彩的人時常到他面前去抗議，因爲我不接受他們命令的原故。他，除了偶然爲國務院「走漏消息」而訴苦外，從來沒有向我說起過「憎恨」國務院，猶如一二個人後來所傳說的。他知道他大多數有關外交政策的演說，聲明和信札，是由我和國務院的官員建議或者徇其要求而草擬初稿的。他對於我們這樣做，引爲滿意。</p>
<p>一九四三年十二月三十一日，大約在我進國務院十一年之後，他送一張條子給我，值得加以一引：「這裘，我送給你一份我送給邱吉爾的備忘錄。（這個備忘錄是附同於我先前送給總梳有關自由法國委員會和義大利的關係的一個備忘錄的。）謝謝上帝，我和國務院並沒有他和他的外交部所發生的同樣困難－F．D．R．」</p>
<p>一般地講，總統的內閣在擬訂外交政策方面發生極小的作用，在內閣會議中，我發覺有關外交關係的討論，並不像想像的那麼多。</p>
<p>關於重要秘密，我對內閣往往保持緘默，因爲曾有把這種消息走漏給受寵的新聞記者和廣播家的事情發生。據我所獲最可靠的消息，這種走漏僅限于極少數的閣員。</p>
<p>若干閣員時常侵犯另一個或其他閣員的職權。這種情形，以後曾有幾次使我感覺極不舒服；例如在討論對日禁運時，以及在華萊士的經濟戰爭局設法分配國務院和其他機關有關經濟戰爭的主要任務時，就曾有這種情形發生。</p>
<p>使外交工作和內政劃分開來旣爲我的一貫政策，總統又專門辦理內政和純軍事的工作，在這種情形之下，我和總統個人相處並沒有若干閣員那麼密切，這是很自然的，因爲辦理內政工作的閣員需要經常和他舉行會議，商討隨時發生而又幾乎數不淸的問題。在這種情形之下，產生一個由幾個人組成的所謂內部廚房內閣，也是很自然的。這些人往往用總統或者其他名義想干涉其他院部的工作，似乎不必獲得總統的吩咐。令人費解的是有二三個閣員以及若干白宮的隨員一直用總統名義，有時候來攻擊國務院的政策，而就在這時候總統和我却正和諧地在一起工作。這是我們這　閣員由若干人必須忍受的若干不愉快經騐之一。</p>
<p>在這些內閣會議巾，總統是輕快的，有趣的。他可親的人格令人充份地感覺到。他喜歡軼事並且喜歡講它們。他幾乎一直是很高與的，談起話來旣輕鬆而又有情趣。</p>
<p>有一天，他一面露齒而笑，一面走進來參加內閣會議，稍爲遲了一點。他說他剛才遭受到一個親屬的一點小小的無禮舉動。這個親屬對他說：「先生，你講得這樣多，以致我們永沒有說話的機會了」。總統一面講這樁趣事，一面大笑，繼而回轉頭來對我說：「柯吉爾，你同意這種說法嗎？」</p>
<p>我回答說：「哦，總統先生，今天方才我來參加會議之前，有幾個新聞記者遇見我，並且對我說：</p>
<p>「部長先生，近來盛傳白宮的食物極爲不佳。我們想知道你的意見」。</p>
<p>『「我從來不吃白宮的東西的。」我回答說。</p>
<p>『「什麼！」他們大聲呌喊起來。「我們知道你時常到白宮去吃中飯或夜飯的。」</p>
<p>『「這的確不錯，」我說。但是在我到白宮去之前，總是先吃中飯或夜飯的。如此，當總梳在吃東西的時候，我可　有　爲講幾句話的機會。」』</p>
<p>總統跟大家一起大笑。</p>

<p>〔本報杭州廿五日訊〕在杭州底民主敎程上，選舉立法委員已是第三踝了。元月廿一，廿二，廿三，這三天，杭州這都會，巳是實施民主敎學的大敎室，在敎室裹，總該有一點環境的　　，於是我們看到各條大街小巷，貼滿了各式各樣的競選標語，競選傳　與競選人的照片。有許冬標語是印製成的，如「一致選舉當國柱石陳立夫先生爲立法委員」，巨幅的標　是請選舉陸京士的，而且陸京士的精印傳單，亦分　在各條馬路的兩旁。在英士街省敎育會巨廈的兩端，　着　塊巨大的　標，是要求選舉　溯　爲敎育界立法委員的。農會立法委員競選人吳望傲，亦貼了很多標語與廣告。市　者公會內外，遍貼着　一致選舉陳訓　，陳博生，程滄波，胡健中等爲新聞界立法委員的各式不同的標語。這民主敎學的敎室佈置，眞可謂琳瑯滿目了。</p>
<p>競選人的汽車</p>
<p>上課了，廿一日的早晨，很多競選人的汽車在馬路上奔馳，把選舉人一車一車的載往投票所，去投掉珍貴的一票。有很多候選人的幫忙者，　量在設法搜羅散票，以增加候選人的票數。</p>
<p>農會的投票所，確有很多農民來投票，他們都來自田間，預備選舉爲他們說話的人，農會的票子，幾乎都集中在吳望伋，吳在選舉以前，做過很多功夫，他在正報上也發表了很多的文章。</p>
<p>商會票子差不多都投光了，一位職員特地拿一本簿子到各個同業公會去簽字，證明已經領去了多少票子。</p>
<p>自由職業太自由</p>
<p>自由職業眞够自由，會計師的三十餘票，全部棄權，三天裏面，一個人也沒有來投，聽說會計師放棄投票的原因，即是表示「抗議」。「抗議」的原因，一說因爲候選人，沒有來打招呼，一說因爲另外一種關係。中醫師的五百五十四張，三天內僅投入四張，比較會計師的全體棄權好些，但爲什麼不如此踴躍，原因還值得研究。</p>
<p>電影　勞選民</p>
<p>教育會還是照國大選舉的老方法，用放映常影來號召會員選舉，也是用放映電影來慰勞選舉的人。因爲敎育會的大禮堂是租給人家做電影院的，正好是近水樓台。</p>
<p>區域立委競選的也是別出心裁，有的包圍各區區長，有的酬懸保甲長，有的拉攏親戚朋友，在各街坊游說活動。有的利用學生挨家挨戶勸說，各種方法不一而足，眞是「各有巧妙不同」！</p>
<p>工會的工人們，集體往投票所投票，郵務工會最神氣，一車車油綠色的大郵車，載得滿滿的綠衣人，到工會去投票。</p>
<p>新聞記者有勁</p>
<p>最緊張熱烈的，莫過於新聞託者的立委競選了。這次新聞記者立委競選，大家看得很重，所以進行也比較最緊張，可說是民主第三課中最精采的節目。第一天早上，就有許多人去投票，管理投票的人非常嚴格，說非本人來投票不可。後來，這件事又恐怕做不通，於是改爲有證即可投票，於是紛紛投入，第一天結果，陳訓　佔了第一位，到第二天，更白熱化了，四出拉票的人更多，許多散落在各個角落裏的票子，都被搜羅了來，在投票所裏，你監視着我，我監視着你，一有消息，馬上傳達到競選活動的「指揮所。」</p>
<p>第三天更緊張，各個候選人的代表開始了談判，由談判又進行競選。熙熙攘攘，吵吵鬧鬧，爭一個不休。</p>
<p>新聞記者的投票櫃是設在自由職業團體的一個票櫃內的，其他幾個自由職業團體的競選與新聞記者團體的競選，比較起來，其　鬧程度相去眞有天壤之別，他們都袖着手眼看新聞記者的熱烈緊張，不禁　然嘆曰：「新聞記者眞有勁！」</p>
<p>最後刹那一幕</p>
<p>到選舉的最後一刹那，陳訓　和胡健中的票子還是領先，後來胡健中的票子又投進了十多張，陳訓　也投進了十多張，陳博生也投進很多，程滄波也有投入，這才把競選緊張的一幕算是結束了。</p>

<p>— 澎湖</p>
<p>一個風平浪靜的夜晚，記者乘了台航公司的恒春輪，從高雄渡過七十八浬的台灣溝，旭日初　，霞光萬道，迎着我們踏上了在開羅會議中爲人遺忘了英文名字的「台灣的門鎖」－澎湖。</p>
<p>捕魚人兒和他們子孫，　滿在碼頭，一個個枯黑的，瘦瘠的面龐尚我們發　。海風吹得孤島沒有高渦屋頂的樹，也把他們的眼睛吹得紅腫羞明。</p>
<p>缺糧八月粒米如珠</p>
<p>澎湖列島是合台灣海峽六十三個小島嶼的總稱，其中有人島二十個，無人島四十三個，面積總計不過一二六方公里餘，但却住上了七萬多人，密度很大，可是有含着鹽份的强烈的海風，沒有雨，沒有河川，沒有喬木。雖然是一個平均只有十七米，最高不過六十米的低平台地，但看不到一塊水田，農作物只有高梁，落花生，甘商，在第四紀洪積　玄武岩的地質上還比較適合。大都份人吃甘　，有的甚至撈海藻充飢，然而即使是豐年，甘商等的產量也僅够全島四個月的消費。缺糧八個月，以一個人每月最少消費十五斤米計，就要九百萬斤。這裹沒有儲藏，又缺少交通工具，仰給台灣本島，往往遠水救不了近火。米在這裹是珍珠，雖然這裏盛產珊瑚，但珊瑚不如米，珊瑚產在深海，過去的技術設備，日本人沒有留下來，現在三個小舖子在賣存貨，幾年後的珊瑚之島會看不到珊瑚。</p>
<p>李節風起　與世隔絕</p>
<p>在五百噸在恒春輪上一個澎湖縣政府的科長向記者說：你們不該坐了大船來，起初我還不懂他這種說法，繼而他解釋說，一年中難得有一·二次大船到澎湖去，澎湖人來去多是乘三·四十噸的小汽船，風猛浪高，這間不容髮的滋味，不是過來人是沒法領略的。現在維持海路交通的，只有艘公營的「台交一一七號」以及民營的千歲，振興，高香，海廢等數艘，每年十月到明年三月間，這些船是無法和季節風搏鬥的，冒險的話，十九出岔子，船隻傾覆，人反而被魚吃了去。於是交通斷絕，與仳隔離，誰聽得見他們在呼號，呼號的只是海嘯，還會夾着鹽雨向這些孤立無援的人們襲擊。老百姓是挺淳厚的，以最熱鬧擁有二萬六千人的馬公鎭言，一個月中難得有一件刑事案件。二·二八在這裏沒有絲毫動靜，固然新聞紙經月看不到一張，收音機也置不起，但他們多有與世無爭的性格，他們只想怎樣在海浪裹找希望，找生命！</p>
<p>澎湖交通公司經營三十三公里的公路業務，客貨少，汽油缺乏，壞了零件就沒法補充，陸路交通也停頓了，負責人一再懇求省府將批准補助的十五萬元發下來。</p>

<p>澎湖四面環海，寒暖流交匯，漁業最發達，澎湖過去半數以上的人均以海爲田，從事潐撈，日管時代發達到漁船有二千餘艘，前年計是如此，實際數字要超出三倍，如再謀改進，可以達到十倍。戰後船毀了大半，潐港，貯油糖，造船塲全選破壞，最重要的製冰廠，一直停了工。沒有冰就沒有漁業，所多台灣本島的人預備了冰船，以賤價　取了這旣少，也談不上有振興漁業的力量，因爲整個的問題得不到解決，交通，糧食，和漁業互爲因果，也就是今日澎湖苦雖的　結。魏主席曾向澎湖人們宣布：風季過去後，一定撥輪定期航行臺澎。他並負責保證給澎民以足够的水－金魚盈海，但願「捕魚人兒世世窮」眞是一首歌，不是一個　。</p>
<p>邊疆大吏　兩度蒞臨</p>
<p>以「家裏失火最先要搶出總理遺像」敎育澎民的縣長徐升平，用海軍官職綜理縣政，年輕肯幹，夏令營辦得有聲有色，只是有許多塲合　神充沛得有些過火，但也難怪邊疆大吏二百年來到過澎湖的，鄭成功以後就是魏主席了！</p>
<p>全島分佈了廿一個國民學校，三個縣立中學，一個省立中學，一個省立水產職校，學生總計有八千一百多人，先生苦，學生也苦，他們期待漁業振興能過些好日子。</p>
<p>澎湖是東南鎖鑰，馬公是鎖裏的機械，海軍要港的色彩很濃厚。要塞上雜草叢生，幾尊舊砲靜靜蹲着，在現階段戰爭工具的日新月異下，這些砲多少已失去它的効用了，記者爬上了臺頂，遠眺着白浪滔天，這裹還指得出法國，荷蘭，日本　武者過去攻略澎湖的登陸處，馬公鎭上還留着法國古巴中將的紀念碑，與甲午戰爭中日本混成支隊的千人塚，這告訴出澎湖人在兩世紀來，就沒有過着一天好日子。當記者離去這塊形如荒土的小島時，成千的人在岸上呼呌，兩隻小艇還送出港口，揮帽舞巾，依依惜別，差一點使我淌下眼淚！</p>

<h3 id="c113">在僑滙泛濫中　閩南僑胞百熊 <a href="#c113" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e113" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">113</a></h3>
<p>〔本報福州廿四日航訊〕閩省晋江，南安，同安，海　各縣算是閩僑鄉。這個角落，在政治，經濟，文化乃至軍事的觀點上着眼，似乎是無足輕重的地方，但是，它恐怕是國內最豪綽，最奢侈，最糜爛的地帶。</p>
<p>記者常與自閩南僑鄉來　人　接　，在他們的談吐中對於僑鄉的社會現狀無不感慨萬端。</p>
<p>勝利以後，一度斷絕　僑匯，又　源地流入了僑鄉，給整個僑鄉重披上繁榮旖旎的錦裳。僑匯之於祖國，於地方固然是一筆龐大的收入，而且也是僑眷之甘澤；可是，因爲僑匯沒有適當的宣洩，起了若干　有　　性的　　，在橋鄉普遍地蔓延，發酵，造成僑鄉各種社會選票。</p>
<p>僑資刺激物價</p>
<p>閩南各縣物價的高昂，不能說不食僑資之賜。歸僑帶來了大批黃金外幣，用以置業，用以購物，甚至用以賭博，用以標妓，黃金完全成了通貨，物價在黃金外幣大量流通下步步上漲，晋江的魚肉市塲比廈門貴（廈門比福州貴，福州比南京貴），僑眷在市塲上出入，皆用外匯的黑市價作標準。儘管法幣數目龐大，折成外幣，不渦爾爾，高物價與僑眷無關，不過，可憐了當地的公務員與農民。</p>
<p>少女願嫁番客</p>
<p>因爲物價的高漲，貧富懸殊的現象前其顯著。歸僑有的是錢，便成了少女擇偶的理想對象。歸僑迎娶夫人，聘禮一二千萬元不在說下，其備辦的時髦裝飾動輒耗費數億元，地方貧窮的女性，對於如此豪綽的番客，其仰慕與　往，比中古時代西班牙　女之景仰奏凱歸來的武士，恐怕還要狂熱。女人大多拜金，此亦不足爲怿。</p>
<p>僑婦爭妍鬥艷</p>
<p>女人是消費生活最強這一環。僑婦們憑其雄厚的經濟力量，生活盡情享受，姿童揮霍。服飾爭奇鬥艷，上下「美式」配備，往往扮成極不調和的神態，見之令人發噱。她們甚至週身裝飾着半斤以上的黃金飾物，炫耀人前。僑婦無所事事，乃以酬神演戲爲娛樂，　費數有萬金無稍吝色。晋江鄉下（晋江爲最大之僑鄉）應時而生之西服店，美容院，照相館，花新品店，綢緞鋪如雨後春筍，簡直大有中國的「好萊塢」的情調。</p>
<p>金錢製造罪惡</p>
<p>在僑鄉中，美鈔成爲各色人等所獵取的目的地，美鈔容納了人生的全部價值與意義。賭博，械鬥，搶刦，娼妓部是金錢濫氾下的產物。富而多金的歸僑，時常作爲人肉市塲的主顧，閩南鄉下的「鹹肉莊」，一夜風流，美鈔十元，在風流僑客需求之下，私娼正一天一天的增加。僑鄉因爲沒有充份的娛樂以娛僑客，所以，賭博也成了代用品，財風旣熾，奸宄易於浥跡其間，所以，洽安也連帶成了問題，僑鄉搶掠之風則最爲僑客所担心。</p>
<p>高利剝削貧農</p>
<p>大的僑資，因爲沒有引導到正當途徑，乃加深了農村的危機。農民在靑黃不接時機，往往利用剜肉補疳的救急辦法向僑胞借高利貸維持，僑鄉盛行着「浮水貨」制度，在收成以前二三個月，一祖津水粟只賣六七萬元，花生一担八萬元，農民先支浮水貨的貨款來購買肥料，等到收成時結果十之八九都是債主的東西。僑客就在此時收買，囤積觀望，因而土產的價格爲之操縱，物產昂揚，農民困苦不堪言狀。</p>
<p>僑匯怎樣運用</p>
<p>僑眷携着巨額的僑匯，並非不欲投資企業，實因無此適當的機會與條件。據聞閩南各地的僑鄉，常有土豪劣紳揚言組織企業公司，用欺詐的手法騙取僑胞資金，因而失去了僑胞對於國內人士的信心。假使政府能够在閩南設立若干小型工廠，賦以種種權利的保證，當可誘導一部分僑匯走向生產之途。在國內產業資本缺乏的今日，僑匯是極可利用的一股力量。（特派記者陳正予）</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕本市美術茶會，頃編纂「上海市美術年鑑」，由敎育局長李熙謀作序原序如下：</p>
<p>「美術乃民族文化之麗景，生命活躍之結晶，就其作用而論，大之可以窺人民生活情調之趨勢與整個文化之興替。觀乎歐洲文藝復興之肇始，實以美術家爲之先驅，我國漢唐文物之盛，亦以美術與宗敎爲之先導：小之可以陶冶性靈，化暴戾爲祥和，其影響於社會習俗，豈可忽視哉？</p>
<p>上海交通便利，近代人文皆薈萃於此。舉凡文化敎育科學政治經濟，莫不居風氣之先，處領導地位，即就美術一端言之，其派別之演進，理論之發展，影響且及於整個世界藝壇，爲我國新興藝術之發祥地，各地美術家，挾其藝來遊者，皆得收名定價，其情形實有類於義大利之羅馬，法蘭西之巴黎。</p>
<p>惟上海一隅，市區廣袤，人姻稠密，爲謀藝術界人士便於藝術學理之探討，意見之交換，情感之聯繫，有各項美術國體之組織，其最著者如中國畫會，上海美術協會，上海畫人協會，美術茶會等，對於美術品之展覽，美術學術之研究，協助政府推動美術敎育，以及襄助社會救濟事業者，貢獻殊多。</p>
<p>雖然，上海之位旣如此重要，美術界人士對於政府社會之貢獻又多，美術事業之發展又速，其間演變　遞之迹，與社會文化之關係，自甚密切，苟無整個有系統之紀錄，則非特時代稍久堙歿無徴，即國內外欲明瞭上海市美術界當前之動態，亦不可得。本市美術茶會諸君有鑒於此，爰有編篡美術年鑑之舉，其意義之深遠，固不待言，而有助於美術敎育與國家文獻殆可預卜。</p>
<p>抑有進者，美術在敎育上之價值，與社會風俗關係之重要旣如上述，敎育局有鑒及此，乃有美術館之籌設，祇以市府經費支絀，正式成立，尚待時日。美術館籌備處曾有百年畫展之舉，最近將舉行淸代畫展，深荷本市美術界人士之熟忱贊助，至爲感佩，所望美術界人士繼續協助，加意督促，庶美術館得早觀厥成，匪特我國文敎之幸，抑亦我上海全體市民所馨香祝禱者也，是爲序。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕社會局吳長，於昨晨九時，召集南北米市塲管理委員會胡文安，徐頌仁，印福祥，胡咸鋼，蔡聲明，顧益生，查　山等七人談話。討論有關米市塲交易，與食米價格管制等問題。民食調配會常務委員葉實夫，及社會局糧食科長吉明齋，亦列席參加。決定各點如下：</p>
<p>（甲）重行審定入塲交易糧商辦法：　由南北二米市塲管理委員會，檢齊已發入塲證之編號名加，在一月廿九日前，呈送社會局審核。　審核事宜，由社會局　一小組專責辦理。並得由兩管　委員會，推代表一人列席，以備諮詢。　經小組審定准許人塲之糧商，由社會局另發入塲證，以憑查驗。所有舊證無論已否滿期，一律取銷。　無人塲交易資格之粗商業務善後問題，另行商討，（以專銷救濟米糧，或政府配售米爲原則。）</p>
<p>（乙）整飭向外埠採購米糧辦法：　由社會局另設小組研究，由吉科長召集。　由南北二市塲管埋委員會，會同提供意見，以資參考。</p>
<p>（丙）爲防止農曆年關以內米價波動，以前社會局所定食米侮石售價，不得超過一百四十五萬元一項命令，繼續有效，由市塲管理委員會切實辦理。</p>
<h3 id="c138">食米上落不大　油市買氣濃厚 <a href="#c138" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e138" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">138</a></h3>
<p>昨南北市共到米糧一萬三千一白餘石，天寒轉晴，市况早漲午回，結局粳秈無甚榮辱，白元亦少波動。麵粉廠方拋售，各牌麵粉共計一萬餘包，價格仍舊，惟兵船老車粉求者頗殷，步砌萬餘元。麩皮交淡平疲。</p>
<p>豆餅客胃不振，回挫三五千元。黃豆去化冷懈，客豆回疲一二萬元，杜黃堅定之格。荼豆北銷兌活，市勢挺秀，微升一二萬元。蠶豆另化亦暢，供不應求，緻漲三四萬元。虹豆堅挺，赤豆再加二三萬元，紅糧貨稀步升，緻　二三萬元。</p>
<p>包米北洋動而不　，略升萬元。芝蔴天津續辦，市勢俏利，油廠進胃亦貪，盤旋上升，再漲七八萬元。生仁廣帮暢吸，本街競　，猛漲二十餘萬元。</p>
<p>油市消化活靈，買氣濃厚，豆汕加三四萬元，生油上漲七八萬元，菜油淸油均高三五萬元，蘑油猛升十萬元。</p>
<p>茶價猛漲</p>
<p>茶市洋莊交易，雖仍冷落，但本街與客帮走銷蟬聯，買氣興奮，且有見貨即拖之勢，是以價格方面，賣戶感於貨稀而居奇，遂掀起猛烈之漲風，收市結果，每担各軋升數十萬元至近百萬元不等。</p>
<p>青糖回振</p>
<p>昨糖市趨勢平定，赤白糖上落較微，惟靑糖因連日步跌過甚，實銷漸動，價乃回升四五萬元。如汕提靑爲一百四十三四萬元，前盤爲三十九萬元至三十七萬元，刁靑最小到過一百二十九萬元，昨開一百三十二四五萬元，公會劃盤，現貨二四粗白一百六十八萬元至八萬五千元，四半白一百六十七萬五千元，期貨棧單市勢較軟。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕本市證券交易所，昨奉財經兩部本年一月廿三日通知，略以證交經紀人所具財產或資本，依證交營業細則第六條規定，爲五千萬元以上。前以市塲動蕩，股價增高，爲保障市塲安全，及客戶利益計，經指飭證交，參酌經紀人現有之資本額，及市塲情况，提高資本最低限額。凡經紀人資本不足新限額者，責令增加在案。茲爲便利經紀人一律辦理起見，各經紀人資本額至少應爲國幣五億元。復查證交經紀人保證金原爲五千萬元。除已以現金及美金債券繳納外，並應增加國幣一億五千萬元，合共爲二億元。關於增加保證金部份，應於文到之日公告，並限於一個月內辦竣。增加資本部份，則限於文到之日起，三個戶內辦竣。逾限不辦，即予吊銷執照。證交常局昨接文後，當於下午四時，召開臨時常務理事會議，理事長杜　主席。除即席報告財經兩部之通知外，並即於昨日會後，在市場公告。</p>
<p>〔又訊〕經紀人保證金，原爲五千萬元，其中現金二千萬元，美金價券三千萬元。增加保證金後，現金與債券之分配比率如何，財經兩部之通知中，並未規定，聞尚待請示決定云。</p>

<p>公債昨平庸而稍疲，成交約四百萬。統丙晨開七萬二，自七萬三退至六萬七，最後仍站晨開價徘徊，較上週六甲乙跌一千元，統丙降三千元，丁戊尚平。</p>
<p>外股昨初高繼回，證券帮及散戶俱售，怡紗即自六四萬五起，步降至五八萬左右掙扎。港常雖亦高後回平，形勢在飄忽中趨疲。</p>
<p>晨開時除遞信利未見振作外，餘均見穩。永紗以七七〇元及七八七元登塲，開後仍有回風，退至七六三元及七八四元。此時塲外喊價又超過遞交十餘元，乃升至七九〇元及八一二元。後以塲外查電話加緊，降至七八〇元及七九九九元，廣帮進高十餘元，塲外息價誤傳開三角六及四角〇五人心頹唐。中途場外息揭曉，雖爲三角三及三角七分半，仍覺過高，買方渙散，逐步下游，塲外漸漸與遞交軋平。近午回小至七四五元及七七〇元低價，午收升爲七五八元及七七八元，結果較上週六即交股計新華麗安中法各報縮至三元一，洋商維持亦乏效果，結果較上週六計紙版跌一成，怡紗英聯會德豐怡啤航業均跌半成，鋼業　挫，業廣則平。</p>

<p>近除長毛絨麥而登兵船大衣呢外，寒季冬令需　之各檔平厚呢大衣呢　，成應銷不銷之現象，本街客帮齊乏點綴。標準行市，因此莫不齊由高峯而步降，蓋其銷令已過十之七八，以是當令應銷之厚貨呢羢，反不若尚未實銷之春夏薄貨呢羢之銷路旺也。昨白帆布每碼喊價九萬五千元，蘇膠布七萬五千元，防雨布十一萬元，絲光羽紗普通均售七萬二千五百地。</p>

<p>紗價互有升沉</p>
<p>昨日棉紗市况紡建公司售開議價，略予提高，多空搏鬥甚烈。北帮去化轉盛，同業以銀根鬆弛，　面帮哄抬甚勁。四十二支　鳳細紗自六千萬關開盤，霎時衝出六千萬關。高喊六千零七十萬。嗣開美貸有望，股市全面報小，人心頓轉虛軟，本街實銷不動，織廠商吸胃平淡，市勢下游，兼有獲利吐售，結果四十二支藍鳳細紗，比週末步升十萬，爲五千九百八十萬元。其餘各支粗細紗互有二三十萬至四五十萬元之升沉。</p>
<p>布疋進出稀少</p>
<p>昨日棉市市况，以週六紡建大量供應，市上籌碼增加，廠家因頭寸局部軋齊，甚少進出，客帮以運輸及頭寸關係，夭津幫等斬售頻起，漢口幫電報受阻，吸納平庸，布商　　及散戶因經濟緊迫，不斷脫手，故結果十二磅各細布，比週末軋跌自五千至二萬三五千元，惟嗶嘰及直貢細斜較秀，其他各布升沉甚微。</p>
<p>現棉市勢續堅</p>
<p>昨日規棉市活絡，同業因棉紗趨漲，人心俏昂，紗廠納胃展開，同業抵補甚烈，市價高翔，脚地堅挺。成交七五〇包，送廠價做開脫力司五七八萬七千，漢細五三〇萬七千，棧交價做開漢細五二〇萬八千，脫力司五八七萬，周浦籽花下水貨一一萬五千。</p>

<p>六區棉紡公會　向經委會呼籲</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕六區棉紡公會，鑒於報載花紗布管理實施細則，政府正在審訂之中，因未有同業參加，表示意見，故其內容如何，無從知悉。此事關於紡織業整個生存，及前途甚大。爰經各會員要求，提請常務理事會，向全國經委會，經濟部，及紗管會呼籲，俾得在公布前，有貢獻意見機會，以昭鄭重。</p>
<p>再代紡代織，採取契約委託方式，有生產日報表，及統稅紀錄可稽，實無派駐廠專員之必要。又聞該會理事長王啟宇氏，正赴華南考察，刻已由會急電王氏，即日返申，主持會務云。</p>

<p>— 劉佐人</p>
<p>我國是一個钜額入超的國家，戰前每年三萬萬元以上的貿易逆差，主要就靠僑匯收入去抵補。所以僑匯不但是平衡我國國際收支的重要項目，補充我國外匯基金的主要泉源，且對我國財政金融關係，裨益甚大。</p>
<p>抗戰勝利後，我國依然是處於人超國的地位，而且由於外　玫策的未著成效國內生產的日趨萎縮，貿易逆差益形嚴車。僑匯不獨未見增加，反爭相逃港，國際收支差額日大，所以如何吸收僑匯，挽回這種逆勢，實爲當前一個重要問題。　者對於僑匯問題，素極注意，去秋乘主持　　廣東省銀行開幕之機會　，曾與　各方人士接觸，實地視察所得，深感爭取暹羅僑匯之重要，爰作此文</p>
<p>爭取　　僑匯的意義，可從下列三點分述之：</p>
<p>第一：從華僑人口的分布上言，暹羅華僑實佔全球華僑之，首位。根據僑委會一九四〇年統計，全球華僑人口共爲八·五四六·三七四人，其分布如下表：</p>
<p>居留地　人口數</p>
<p>南北美洲各地　一·六〇一·二一八</p>
<p>越南　四二六·三五三</p>
<p>馬來亞　二·三〇〇·三五三</p>
<p>荷印　一·三四四·八〇九</p>
<p>北婆羅洲　六八·〇三四</p>
<p>甸　一九三·五九四</p>
<p>菲律賓　二〇·五〇〇</p>
<p>合計　八·五四六·三七四</p>
<p>從上項統計看來，暹羅華僑實佔全球華僑總數百分之三十四以上，僑胞人數最多，從人口比例說，當知暹羅僑匯之重要。尤其因戰時南洋遭受破壞最甚，南僑事業與人口當有重大損失，戰後南洋僑匯數目，比不上戰前，自在意料之中。而暹羅因戰時受損害較少，僑胞雖受暹縱排華之影響，略受損失，然實爲爭取僑匯最便捷又最有希望之地區。因此，從僑胞人數看，已可窺見暹羅僑匯之應予重視。</p>

<h3 id="c147">生產與消費之失衡 <a href="#c147" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e147" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">147</a></h3>
<p>— 孫恆</p>
<p>欲明生產者與消費者之相互　賴關係，首須明瞭消費者之所得，即由生產渚付出。不獨從事農工事業之人，其所得係由企業家直接支出，即政府捐稅亦取自生產者；或直接由生產者繳納，或由消費者從生產者取得之進款內挖出一部分，納與政府。然後政府以捐稅所得，給與軍政人員而成爲非直接生產人員之所得。故吾人可作下之定義：即一國之國民所得，等於一國之總生產價值。</p>
<p>生產者旣以其資金給與國民，而國民即以其所得購買消費物或資本物，還給予生產者。如是生產者始能從事再生產，再付與國民，作爲第二期之國民所得。如是生產與消費始能平衡。設國民不以其全部收入從事消費或投資，而有剩餘之產品，留在生產者手中。則此剩餘之產品，雖依廣義言，仍爲社會之投資。然生產者因已有剩餘產物，下期之投資，即爲之减少。從而下期之國民所得，亦因之减少。更影響於消費。故理想之生產與消費平衡，仍難達到。（因生產雖减消費更减之故）此爲歐美先進國之經濟病態。挽救之法，或覓取國外市場，增加出口。或在國內增加新投資，如舉辦公共工程，因而增加國民所得，增加有效需要。且因投資擴張倍數之關係，一事業之新投資，常激刺其他事業之投資。因而國民所得，常數倍於原米新投資之數。至增加投資及增加生產之目的，究竟係爲增加出口，或增加國內消費。則因國際收支情形而定。如屬於前者，則應緩辦公共工程，以全力投資於出口品之生產。最近英國之經濟計劃，顯然係屬於前者。</p>
<p>在政治未淸明之國家，生產與消費之失調，尚遠甚於上所言者，令分述如下：</p>
<p>一·在工業落後或以農業爲基礎之國家，如農村之生產價值，不還諸農村，則其禍害不堪勝言。昔美國名史學家喬治亞丹著歐洲中古文明史，論羅馬滅亡之原因，謂其經濟因素，至爲重要。羅馬城市之貴族及富有階級，驕奢淫法，而其財富，實取自農村。又對於城市游民，廣施救濟，於農民則苛捐重稅，又强力抑低其產品價格。在昔農民以其生產交換城市物品，其價值仍得回至農村者，今則辛勤所穫，一至城市，半被吞蝕。農村之資本日削，其人口相繼逃亡。留居者多屬赤貧，精神頹喪，體力日衰，　日良田，因無力施肥，變爲　田。故日耳曼蠻軍一至，望風奔潰。昔日羅馬人民剽悍善戰之風，姻消雲散。故與其謂　族之戰勝羅馬，不如謂羅馬之不抵抗，較爲眞實。讀史至此，眞不勝有無窮之慨也－</p>
<p>二·在政治未安定之國，富有階級以其正當或不正當之收人，不投資於本國生產事業，而將其資金逃避國外。如是本國之生產减少，同時國民之總收入减少。無異將本國之一部份儲蓄，移向國外，而增加外國之生產，又增加外國之國民所得。設使因會汚血所得之財富，投資於本國生產事業，則結果僅爲財富分配之不公平。但因其在國內投資，其資本仍暫時付給國民。雖長期言，因財富分配之不均，國民之購買力减退，因而生產亦不得不萎縮。然其害尚係慢性的，非如資金逃避海外之貽禍爲烈也。</p>
<p>國際資金之移轉，本屬流動性的，在工業發達資金過剩之國，爲防止生產過剩，將其資金在國外覓取較有利之市塲，本不足爲病。如美國於第一次歐戰後，即投資於德國在一百億美元之多；又如英美諸國至中國投資，爲數亦屬不少。然此非可語於生產不足資金短細之國家如中國者，中國自抗戰以後，資金大量逃避，設無外國借款及救濟物資抵消其作用，則國民經濟早已不堪問矣。</p>
<p>三·在戰亂頻仍之國，多數壯丁，加入軍隊，可雇月之勞工人數减少，易成充分就業之狀態。若於此際增加發行以從事新投資，則以紙幣計算之有效需要雖加，然因原料與工資之價格，同時增加，生產數額，仍不能增。除非生產技術迅速改良，後者或可增加，然此非短時期可能達到者。又因國內秩序不安，逃避之資金不返，外人投資，杳無把握，必需之生產器材，即不易輸入。欲從藉發行以增加生產，直綠木而求魚也。</p>
<p>理想的消費與生產之平衡係消費者以其所得全部購買消費物或投資物。生產者亦以其全部收入，從事再生產。即使此理想能達到。亦屬靜態經濟。但社會之演進是動態的。設使人口增加，而生產技術不改進，或無新投資，以致產額予增。則國民之生活即爲之降低。故在動態社會中，除改良生產技術外，尚須增加投資。不獨全部儲蓄，須用於再生產，在資金短細之國，尚須輸入外資，及將逃避之資金返回。故吾國在戰事平定之後，如經濟步驟不亂，猶須經數十年之努力始能有成，謀國者盍注意於此乎！</p>
<h3 id="c148">說「誠」（下）「誠」之用 <a href="#c148" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e148" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">148</a></h3>
<p>— 不黨</p>
<p>「誠」之體旣如上篇所述，其用有可說焉。天道之「誠」，賦於人而爲性，賦鈐物而爲理。顧人，萬物之靈，有知覺運動，思慮云爲，物或無之，或有之而幾於無；則「誠」之用，見於人之相與曁夫人之接物者爲多。見於人之相與，則「立己」「立人」；見於人之接物，則「成己」「成物」。「立己」「成己」盡其爲人之道，是謂「盡己之性」；「立人」「成物」，使人成人，使物得所，是謂「盡人之性」，「盡物之性」。</p>
<p>「誠」之賦於人而爲性者，有全有偏；全者「生知」「安行」，謂之「誠者」（亦曰「至誠」）；偏者「學知」「利行」，「困知」「勉行」，調之「誠之者」．「誠者」聖人（亦稱「至聖」），「誠之者」賢者常人。－誠者不勉而中，不思而得，從容中道」；「誠之者擇善而同執之。」「不勉而中」言行；「不思而得」，言知；「從容中道」，謂其於知於行皆得「中庸」之道，自然而然，無所勉强。「誠者」之心身內外，思慮云爲，莫非至道定理。至道定理，自其眞實無妄而言，謂之「誠」，自其無渦不及而言，謂之「中庸」其實一也。「誠之者」其心身之思慮云爲，常加警惕奮勉，以「擇善而固執之」。「善」即無渦之不及之「中」，亦即眞實無妄之「誠」，至道定理是矣。旣致其心之知以求明乎至道定現，復「」其身之能而體之行之，以弗失弗隊。是乃一至曲」之事，故曰：「其次致曲，曲能有誠」。「曲」之爲言，偏也；「致」者，至也，盡也。偏者，殊事殊物；全者，共理公例，共理公例即天地之至道定理，所謂「誠者」是矣。「致曲」云者，猶言盡其一曲之知，即考察乎殊事殊物，求知其所以然之故，然後會而通之，而達其一貫之理例。「誠之」之事，其在斯矣</p>
<p>由「致曲」而至於「誠」，即所謂「自明誠」者。「明」者，明夫殊事殊物所以然之故；；「誠」者，就其所以然之故所會通而得之理例。中庸有曰；「自誠明，謂之性；自誠明，謂之敎。誠，則明矣；明，則誠矣」若「誠」者，理也。理共而事殊，理全而物曲；理，形而上者也，事物，形而下者也。以共而全之形上之理，施於殊而曲之形下之事若物，則事之晦者彰，物之昧者明，故曰「自誠明」。而據理爲推，以類相引，若甲乙並同於丙，因之甲乙同者，固本能之事，性分所當然，故曰，「自誠明，謂之性」。「自誠明」，名學外籀（亦稱演释）之事也。所謂「自明誠」者察乎殊事殊物，得其一曲之情，形下之性，而會其通知其全，而達於形上之理；此名學內　（亦稱歸納）之功，敎之能事，端在此矣，故曰，「自明誠，謂之敎」。夫敎育貴經驗，經驗云者，就耳目之所經，驗其所以然之故，然後運其思慮，會而通之，以成共理公例；理例旣成，轉而操之，以御蕃變，逆朱然，所施無窮，而人事利矣。「明則誠」者，察於殊事殊物，而通乎共理公例，所謂「下學而上達」。「誠則明」者，旣通乎共理公例，所未察者亦不待察而能明；「至誠之道，可以前知」此之謂也。</p>
<p>稟性之全，「生知」「安行」之資，所謂「誠者」之聖人，其「立己」「立人」「成己」「成物」，自然而然，無待修爲之功。若夫稟性之偏，「學」「利」「困」「勉」之質，所謂「誠之者」之賢者與常人，則爲而後然，修而後至，所謂「致曲」所訊「自明誠」，是其功矣。雖然，「曲能有誠」，積其「致曲」之功，亦將有以至於「誠」；盡明夫殊事殊物所以然之故，亦可得其會通，而達於天地之至道定理，以至於「誠」；故曰：「及其知之一也」，「及其成功一也」。蓋尋常之人，心身內外之物態事情，必心經身踐，而後知之能之，甘辛自嘗，利害自當，故其用心也苦，其致力也勤，此之謂「困」「勉」者也。稍進而取資於他人之經驗，假見聞以爲知，憑倣傚以爲能，所謂學知者，學而斯知，知而遂能，不困不勉，所謂「利」也。上焉者，旣無待於經歷踐　，復不假乎聞見倣傚，潛思默察，會而通之，而觸類旁及，施於實事實物，有如不學而知，不習而能，此之謂「生知」「安行」者矣。是三等者，其爲知有難易，及其知之，同此夭地之理，固皆性分之所能知，其爲能有遲速，逮其能之，同此人物之事，固皆性分之所可能，故其所知所成乃一而已。是夭縱之聖與人爲之聖同功，聖人與賢者常人殊途而同歸，此聖賢之所以可而至也。　（未完）</p>
<h3 id="c149">今年國際學校會議 <a href="#c149" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e149" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">149</a></h3>
<p>— 立人</p>
<p>本年度的世界性學術會議，都在活躍起來。戰爭會阻碍這種會議的進行，可是戰後的建設問題，以及維特和平的問題，當我們尚有時間可以思維時，我們即不能不加以思維。「馬上得天下者，不能馬上治之」，武力終止時，自是學術抬頭之日。學術界人士深受戰爭的痛苦，痛定思痛，如何不思？雖學術界人士不一定有力量可以防阻戰爭，但他們是有一部分責任去防阻之的。這也許就是今年世界學術會議特別熱鬧的一種理由。</p>
<p>要在本年內舉行的國際學術會議，似，乎不少，現在讓作者先來報告其中的兩種。一是第十屆的國際哲學會議，另一是第十二屈的國際心理學會議。</p>
<p>我們知道第九屆的國際哲學會議是一九三七年在巴黎舉行的。舉行之後，即接受荷蘭政府的邀請，定一九四一年九月在荷蘭舉行第十屆的會議。可是無情的戰爭把這一次的會議阻礙了。一九四〇年二月的時候，主持這一屆會議的人即決定將這一屆會議無限期的延期。不久荷蘭全境爲納粹所佔，而　屆大會的主席波拉克敎授（Prof．Leonand　Polak）也被捕，且被送入集中營裘慘死了。戰爭的摧殘學術，這便是一種顯例。現在主持該屆大會的人又復決定於本年八九月間（日期尚未十分確定）在荷蘭的庵斯打淡（Amsterdam）重行召集這一屆的大會。同時，國際文敎處（Unesco）也決定加以贊助，所以這一屆大會的舉行大約不會有什麼問題。這一屆的大會鑒於目前哲學思潮的複雜，他們雖接受這種複雜性而沒有統一的幻想，不過他們也不願意這一屆的大會徒爲思想鬥爭的塲所。因此，他們決定在這一屆的大會提出會議的主題。這主題是:「人，人性，及人類的觀念」（Idesa　of　ManHumanity　and　Mankind）。蓋他們認爲這些觀念乃是各種不同思想的公共起源，也是牠們的共同問題。欲對道些觀念作一種哲學的說明，則彼此間的互相諮詢是需要的。而且討論這些觀念時，復須得其他科學，如社會學，心理學，心靈學，人類學及文化史等等的帮助。主題之外，哲學上的專門問題，若知識論，價值論及玄學，自然也在討論之列。唯可能時這些問題的討論最好也能和主題有關。從這一屆大會的主題看來，我們知道世界哲人確已有了一種轉變，即轉變到美哲杜威所謂「人的問題」上去。而這種轉變恰好和我國一貫相承的傳統哲學思想相同。因我國的傳統哲學，不諭任何問題，總是和人生有關而不離開人生的。以故，作者誠心希望這一屆的大會能有我國哲人參加。至這屆大會的主席是荷蘭的H．J．Pos，書記是E．W．Beth，而通訊處則爲：Bern．Zweerskade　23I．Amsterdam－z</p>
<p>關於第十二屆的國際心理學會議原來也是定一九四〇年舉行，亦因戰事影響而延期的。現該會已決定本年七月二十三日起至二十九日止，在蘇格蘭的愛丁堡舉行這一屆的大會。因心理學的本身即和人性問題有關，所以這一屆的大會自然也不會忽視人性問題。我國的心理學界能有人參加，這也是一件很重要的事。該會組織委員會的會長是JamesDrever，總書託是Godfrey　Thomson，而通訊處則爲：Moray　House　Ecinburgh　8。</p>
<h3 id="c150">都市環境與心理病症 <a href="#c150" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e150" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">150</a></h3>
<p>— 方正</p>
<p>都市環境或現代文明曾被許多人視爲神經病的溫床。許多人覺得都市的繁劇刺激是產生心理病症的重要原因。神經病是一個很嚴重　問題，原因也十分複雜。近來社會　對於這一方面的研究，頗有一些值得稱道的結果，從都市環境來看這一個問題，得着一些新鮮的意味。</p>
<p>法銳思與鄧漢（R．E．L．Fari　and　H．W．Dunham）在一九三七年出版的「城市區域之心理病症」便是從這一觀點出發的。他們根據芝加　城與其附近諸公私立的病院中初診的统計來研究心理病症與都市環境的關係，結果是和過去　與麥凱（Shaw　and　Mckay）關於罪犯調查　結果相同。法銳思與鄧漢也將芝加哥城分成六種區域：　熱鬧區，爲　院娼察所在的城中心區，　寄宿區，爲旅館公寓即浪民Hobo的中心，　貧民窟；　里分區；　住宅區；　華貴住宅區。他們發現神經病率與這種分區有極顯然的關係。例如自中心而西北，各該區的頻率是：三六二一七七，九五，七一，六五，五五。如果分區較細密，結果更明顯，高的達四九九，低的僅四八，上面的數字是根據一九二二年至一九三四年初診的總數。但因各區人口懸殊，上而的數字祗是一個比率，即偕以一九三〇年十五歲以上的人口每十萬人爲基準。</p>
<p>如此的結果，可能有多種不同的解釋，而都不必假設心理病症與制市環境有關係的。第一，窮人或者單身漢患病後便不得不進醫院，而富人可以在家中療養，所以貧人病者要多些。第二，或者不是環境產生心理病症，而是有這些病症的可能流到這些區域去。因病而貧，因貧而不得不移居到貧民窟去。所以因果或竟是如此顚倒的。第三，或者也可以用種族而不用環境來說明。例如黑人多集中於貧民區，或者黑人這個種族神經病症本來就多些。現象的因果是不能專從表面上着想的。</p>
<p>但法銳思與鄧漢的詳細結果不容易都作如此的解釋，而他們的結果至少有六個相似的研究——－在美國其它的城市——是可引爲印證的。我們現在就略舉幾個他們研究中的特殊例子。例如精神分裂症（Schizopluenia）的地域分配與文武狂（Manic－cepressire）的地域分配便不同。精神分裂　的分配情形大致與上文所舉的一般結果相彷彿，但文武狂就似乎並沒有這種地區的差異。又專從精神分製症講，因爲病症的複雜，其分配情形也因病型而異。誇大狂（Paranoid）則我集中公寓與旅館區，　　狂（Calatonic）在外國人集中的貧民區多，諸如此類的歧異使我們相信環境對於心理症候不能毫無關係。</p>
<p>爲甚麼精神分裂症是窮人病？我們先得知道精神分裂症的起因。它是一種分裂，即個體與現實失去了接觸的一種極端內傾症候。我們如果追究一個人如何會與現實疏遠起來，這一大半不得不歸罪於環境了。人生來都是好羣的。但窮苦小孩因受社會歧視，因而不得不與社會疏遠，離　索居。與現實越隔絕，便越多誤解，他便將他個人的一切失意，歸罪於社會的阻撓與牽制，他幻想人人對於他自己的迫害。這樣，他便自以爲有了不起的出身與超人的本能，誇大狂便日漸加深。都市環境更加增這種力量，人來人往，誰亦不關心誰的休戚，結果使一個人不得不加增內傾趨向而流於精神分裂的病症中去。</p>
<p>文武狂似乎沒有地區的分別，這不一定即說文武狂是與環境無開的。例如克羅特（Krout）即以爲這是由於病根有先後的關係。精神分裂症的病源是早年的失意，而文武狂的病源則失意較遲。早年的失意大半源於家庭經濟的，後來的失意原因可能多端而不盡在乎家庭的經濟。因此文武狂不像精神分裂症之專　窮人。根據德國心理學者克勒幾姆Kretchmer的研究，文武狂患者多爲肥壯型Pyknic　type，而肥壯型似乎在富人中爲多。因此文武狂可能說是富人病。這種看法容未盡妥，但心裏病症之與環境有關，似乎不是毫無根據的。</p>

<p>— 張其昀</p>
<p>美蘇關係</p>
<p>去年九月二十日爲美國史汀生先生（Henry　L．Stinson）八十壽辰，創刊於一九二二年秋季的「外務」雜誌（Foreign　Affairs）又譯（外交季刊）亦適　二十五週年紀念，特請史汀生撰文，　於紀念號（本年十月）第一篇，題目是「對於美國人民的要求」。（The　Challenge　to　Americane）史汀生爲塔虎塔總統任內的陸軍部長，胡佛總統命史氏爲國務卿，羅斯福總統時代竽任爲陸軍部長。一九三一年九一八事變發生，史氏竹建議以武力對付日本之侵略政策，仗議執言，素爲中國之老友。第二次大戰發生，史氏　贊中　，動員全國，擊敗德國與日本，建立不朽之功勳　。此次在「外交」雜誌的論文，於從論美蘇關係之後，特表示其信念，以爲今日之美國應以世界之自由與繁榮爲目標，貢獻其無限之國力。「外交」雜　是美國的　成刊物，學術地位甚高。我們對於這位老政治家的言論，應該刮目相看。此文雖爲美國人民說法，對於中國人民未始不是寶貴的箴言。</p>
<p>勝利與和平並非爲同義語。目前世界大部分地方不渦是武奘休戰，若千地方已經公然開火，長治久安之道，甚爲渺茫。世界危機隨勝利而俱來，其中最大危機自是美蘇之失和。史氏回憶羅斯福總統屢次欲與蘇聯敦睦邦交，以善意對待蘇聯，並希望蘇聯亦能以善意對待美國。可惜在一九四五年春，羅斯福總統去世以前，蘇聯對美國已經表示不友好的態度。史氏對蘇聯人民忠勇作戰至爲贊佩，但謂目前掌握蘇聯政權的人物，認爲美國式的民治與自由，已臻日暮窮途之境，蘇聯作風正與之背道而馳。美國希望蘇聯成爲良友，這樣的擇交對於蘇聯是有益的。但至少在目前蘇聯認美國爲落伍，一意孤行。世界各地的共產黨惟蘇聯馬首是瞻，且有變本加厲之勢。史氏以爲如果美國人不認識此種事實，以爲吾人對蘇聯友好，蘇聯便能對吾人友好，非自欺欺人即愚不可及。這番話自是對華萊士一般人說的。</p>
<p>史氏自稱他的態度並非消極，更非反俄。只是要使蘇聯確實知道，自由與繁榮並非不可得而兼，在西方民治世界中兩者可兼而有之。美國人民懸該反求諸己，致力生產。外交與內政形影相隨有不可須臾離者。美國的繁榮繫於世界的繁榮，這句話誠然不錯。世界的經濟前途視乎美國的經濟前途，這句話一樣有理由。美國必須努力造成平時生產的新水準，懶惰彷徨和不負責任才是不可救藥的毛病。除非生產增加，否則增加工資和利潤都無從談起。美國還應當用這種精神把西歐等地從失望饑餓和恐怖中趕快救出來。爲之愈速，所費愈少，成幼愈大。自由需要容忍，在人性尊嚴原則之下，自由社會可有不同之方式，不必都與美國一模一樣。美國果能使自由與繁榮成於今世的現實，則共產主義不會成爲威脅，如果不能，不問有無共產主義，我們的文物制度最後必將歸於失敗。蘇聯領袖們注重現實，我們應該拿具體事實來答覆他們，使他們深知非改變宗旨，即將喪失地位，這樣才有效果。否則若徒知盲目的反共將使我們的努力付諸東流。</p>
<p>史氏以爲美國不能長此容忍蘇聯擴張政策的潮流，任意推進到因戰爭而造成的空虛地帶。美國必須表明自已決非擴張字義者。美國的責任在於援助被威脅的人民使其能援助自己。此事良非易易，需要勇敢而機動的政策，能幹而靈敏的實行，和平的建設非一國所能着手，戰爭的準備則一國可以決定。美國必須維特强大武力，使侵略者存有戒心。我們亦知俄人並不樂於作戰，不尚侵略的蘇聯對於美國可以不必有所恐懼。美國爲首先利用原子能的國家，美國人員有神聖的任務，原子能應使人類欣欣向榮，不懸使人類自趨滅亡。在美國國境之內尚有維護自由的自由，此點決不可等閒視之，如果畏首畏尾，敷衍塞責，或竟遺世獨立，隔岸觀火，戰爭恐將不可倖免。</p>
<p>世界政府的建立和原子能的控制，倘無蘇聯參加，因爲不可能之事。然目前聯合國因否決權之頻頻使用而陷於無能爲力。史氏以爲美國應傾其全力，以謀重振聯合國的權威。蘇聯如果不能開誠相與，倒不如揭顯明的反對旗幟。聯合國開宗明義第一章，對於世界問題應有調查報告的權力，不能爲任何大國的否決權所否認。史氏深信美國有力量可解決世界重大問題，但不能採半推半就的態度，亦不能半途而廢。解決困難之道端在於理知與志願，國家的基本政策必須以國民的理解力爲後盾。美國對於世界應負無限責任，凡公私方案與政策，均應以全世界爲背景。亞洲與歐洲的問題，即爲美國的問題。政治上與經濟上的孤立主義，務須歸於澌滅。今日美國之職務在於運用其無限國力爲世界之自由與繁榮而奮鬥。</p>

<p>— 雷紅</p>
<p>有這樣一處地方，人們不用憂盧原子彈之來臨，所得稅只抽百分之一。內閣總理不用奘出政治家的做作態度，倒是消耗大部份時間於領導一隊童子軍。這地方不知離婚爲何事，沒有窮人，十分之九的人民得享六十歲以上的高齡。</p>

<p>國的人民，永遠愉快，他們越過邊界，瞭望到籠罩着饑俄，困感，戰爭的歐洲，一面爲自己慶幸，一面懷疑着叱咤風雲的「開明的」巨頭們所爲何來。他們託得盟國飛機　炸康斯坦湖畔的齊伯林工廠，這晚上北方天邊有慘烈的烽姻。何以會記得的呢？就在這晚上，藍國首都萬陀寺（Vaduz）　上處處放着燄火，慶祝元首約瑟甫二世及其夫人喬琴娜公主喜獲麟兒。</p>
<p>國人民能吃到又好又豐富可是很簡單的食物，而且容易買到，不必仰給黑市。道德高尚，犯罪事件絕無而僅有。因此監獄空虛，衹能出租給鄰國瑞士，以備每月問或提到一個反抗者的拘留之用。</p>
<p>但不要以爲藍國人民是不好交游的遁世者，他們好算世界上最懂　憫的人。三人行，必有一人是活躍的紅十字會會員，爲被蹂躪的鄰國服務，救護衣食不周，貧病交迫的人民。</p>
<p>當希特勒長騙直入奧地利，進而想席捲藍國時候，藍國用一隊童子軍開赴邊界，中途加入了一部份離開了田地農民，隨便拿起一件東西當武器，和德軍對壘。德軍看到了這種奇異隊伍，倒躊躇不前了。納粹終於撤退，尊重了藍喜泰斯坦王國的中立性。</p>
<p>約瑟甫登位的一天，正是希特勒大軍進佔奧地利之時。國王好讀近代文藝，欣賞古典樂曲，　時逗着孩子玩耍。政府尊軍憲法，實行民主。四百人署名的一篇呈文可以左右國會。藍國人不向皇族納稅——所得稅是每元扣一分錢。</p>
<p>關於低稅率的原因，內閣總埋弗烈克說得好：「當然我們沒有軍費支出，因爲我們無需海陸空軍。我們不必舉辦社會事業，每一個人都有足够的田地去瞻養家族。而我們的郵票爲世界集郵家所逐鹿，我們自然樂於供應。設立海關及稅局是太費錢了，我們就把這種「權益」出租給瑞士代徴稅收。便她外交政策也是瑞士代辦，省掉一筆派遣使節時費用。」</p>
<p>外國各大廠利用藍國沒有工會，紛紛前去開設分廠，藉此發展廠務——因爲藍國只有「家庭團結」。例如，一家旅館經理與凡陀寺的一個肉店主人發生了小爭執。結果，經理不願再去作成他的生意。但是旅館房屋漏水，泥水匠一致推說另有工作，拒絕修理。鉛皮匠，電燈匠都是在需要時如法推諉。後來還是撤換了經理，方能重振旅業。似乎一切技工都是肉店主人的親戚故舊。</p>
<p>國有一所電影院，僅在星期日開映。因爲平常日子須工作，而晚上應該休息。十八歲以下兒童不准到戲院裏去；放映的影片以不是代表好萊塢的奢華生活者爲限。他們指出附麗着淫佚的影片，不能使人民感到愉快和滿足。</p>
<p>藍喜泰斯坦所以能和平生存於世者，據弗列克的意見；「我們有富足的自求愉快之道，但却貧乏地缺少征服者之夢耳。」</p>
<h3 id="c153">北平寒流 <a href="#c153" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e153" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">153</a></h3>
<p>— 劉雁聲</p>
<p>據氣象台報告，北平今年之冷，爲十年來所僅有，寒暑表零下十七度，爲歷年所未見。</p>
<p>北平之寒冷，古人紀詩吟詠，注錄册籍，已屢見不鮮，際此奇寒　取北平，侈談前人紀寒之作，亦可爲北平風土之介，配合李　，亦多資談助也。</p>
<p>恕室甲乙遊草託宮友應持云；一　野號天風，射我玉肌粟，朝出狐謀裘，夜臥鷺拳足；脛縮被生　，半床未嫌促。」此詩形容寒冷意味，可謂刻畫已盡，設非身歷其境，不能如此深刻也。</p>
<p>圭齋集歐陽原功漁家傲詞中謂：「貂袖豹袪銀鼠　，美人來往氈車續。」亦爲形容北平寒冷中生活之情態，富豪　閣寒冷之味雖稍减，但珍貴皮衣，取以禦寒，非獨表現闊綽，亦以非珍貴皮衣不足以抗奇寒。</p>
<p>風月餘談錄載「京師地氣苦寒，向於每歲十月朔生火，至二月朔。然遇極冷之日，雖火不溫。」燕京歲時記，春明釆風志，均有此項記載。北平冬寒，羣以火爐爲恩物，火爐形式甚多，數法亦夥，且多北平本地土製，精巧耐用。燕京歲時記載：「火爐係不灰木爲之，白於　石，輕暖堅固。」春明采風志亦載：「爐多用不灰木者，以其四圍皆煖也。爐中之小者，矮而肥，謂之小胖小子。寒家以花盆乘之，小者　之，省而耐久，近歲有　　做成者，輕而便。」此不啻北平火爐一段小史。不灰木爲北平特產，產於西山，屬鑛質，經久耐用，發熱力特强。北平市肆中，昔年多有經營不灰木火爐者，近十餘年來，人多用洋爐，不灰木所製，乃落伍，此種市肆亦相率改業，不灰木火爐乃成歷史名詞，若求之於北平世家中，尚有存用未，壞者，每逢寒冬，陳而使用，當視爲　寶也。不灰木以外，尚有用銅爐者，富麗堂皇，顧銅爐爲爐套之性質，中有爐心，升火後舉置銅製　套中，爐心有鐵製，不灰木所製亦多。自新式洋爐盛行，此種古董式火爐，相繼爲人　置不用矣。</p>
<p>由火爐而而談及煤，北平爲產煤區，西北郊門頭溝即爲煤之總匯，在昔年爲專供北平之用者，水曹淸暇錄中所謂：「西山之煤價不甚昂，頗獲利濟。」可知煤爲北平之特產。四朝詩史載吳養原詠煤球詩，語多古奧，所謂：「北地苦凜冽，西山富孕育，程材火發石，爭功燧鑽木。」又謂：「丸泥秦關雄，炭團宋臣獨。利用超　蘇，錫名假蹴鞠。」煤球入詩，此或爲首選也。</p>
<p>古人形容北地寒冷，輒謂墮指裂膚，更讀及金臺游學草所記方翔詩所謂：「燕山之寒南所無，十月重　已擁狐，白日乘風面似割，夜氣一　猶徽膚。」際今寒流尚欲逗留，寒且加甚，泚筆述此，心猶瑟瑟也。</p>
<h3 id="c154">清季外使入覲之爭 <a href="#c154" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e154" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">154</a></h3>
<p>— 一峯</p>
<p>在鴉片戰爭之前，滿淸皇朝閉關自守，沒有什麼外交可言。其後，英法美俄各在北京設立公使館，纔暢開門戶。但是，當時的朝廷重臣，不屬於夜郎自大之徒，即屬蒙昧無知者流，因此，淸季外交的顢頇，由「輕外」以至「媚外」而「懼外」，其間笑話百出，今人讀之，猶有啼笑皆非的感慨。</p>
<p>臂如英法之役以後，歐美國家的公使館在北京相繼成立了。依照歐美的通例，公使們必須覲見駐在國元首，呈遞國書，這也是一種必不可少的禮節。但淸廷却一再拒絕這樣做。咸豐爲了患其覲見，寗願不肯返京。同治嗣位，各國公使請求覲見，總理衙門則推托太后聽政，以男女授受不親的「大義」予以拒絕。而他們拒絕各國公　覲見的唯一原因，爲中國奴才式的跪拜禮和西洋式的鞠躬禮之爭。當時那些老朽的總理衙門大臣，及封疆大吏，一致都認爲不行跪拜禮是有辱國體桀驚不馴的大事體。舉山東巡撫丁實楨之言可爲一般朝臣之議論代表。他說：彼旣不行中國之禮，其桀驚之氣，自難據馴……若准入覲，恐將來錐刀之事，動煩睿鑒……似不如先爲婉拒，以社其漸也。」吳大澂更謂：「我國定制從無不跪之法，朝廷之禮，乃列祖列宗所遺之制。」不獨抬出「列祖列宗」的大帽子，而且並認爲外使入覲不跪，則「普天臣民」，都將因此引起「憤懣不平」，眞不知何所據而云然，其香庸無知也可知</p>
<p>尤其可笑的是一八七二（同治十一）年，同治皇帝大婚。各國駐京大使以爲中國逢到這樣的大典，一定會邀請他們參禮，他們也可以藉此滿足一審見見中國皇帝的好奇心理。誰知事有大謬不然者，在這一大之前，他們不但未被邀請，而且　　方面却相反的派了一位名呌　　者到各使館去分別通知他們，在良　　一天，所有外國人都不可在街上行走，簡直將當時的外國人常作不吉利的洪水猛獸了。如此，自然很引起各外使的不滿意。第二年，同治親政，各外使又於事先堅決要求觀見。一時廟堂之上，議論紛紜，有的力言不可，以爲此例一開，外使可以隨時乘機要挾皇帝；有的甚至請求陳兵以懼之，如邊實泉所　云：「皇上獨伸乾斷，以不見拒之，並諭中外大臣嚴設兵備，以崇朝廷尊嚴之體，以杜外夷驕橫之萌。」簡直要向外宣戰了。結果　是李鴻章等幾個稍明大體的大臣，採取「祇准一見，不准再見，只准各使同見一次，不准一國單獨求見」的折巾辦法，解決了這個入覲之爭。並將西洋的三鞠躬禮改成五鞠躬禮，改三爲五，以示尊重的意思，各國外使莫可奈何，也只得照辦了。</p>
<p>事後，京報並誇張地記下這麼一節滑稽的經過，云：</p>
<p>「英公使先誦國書約二三語，即五體戰慄。帝曰：「爾大皇帝健康。」英使不能答。皇帝又曰：「汝等果欲謁朕，其意安在？其速直陳。」仍不能答。各使皆次第捧呈國書，有國書失手落地者，有卑帝問而不能答者，遂與恭親王同被命出。然恐懼之餘，雙足不能動，及至休息所，汗流浹背，以致總署賜宴，皆不能赴。其後恭親王語各公使曰：「吾曾語爾等謁見皇帝，非可以兒童戲視；爾等不信，今果如何？吾中國人，豈如爾外國人之輕若鷄羽者耶！」」</p>
<p>事實竟是如此？恐怕也只有當時的人知道了！</p>
<h3 id="c155">談扒手 <a href="#c155" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e155" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">155</a></h3>
<p>— 黎里</p>
<p>最近在報上，看到一位讀者要求淸除扒手的投函，據說在寗彼路之河南路與山東路間的一段錢莊區，扒手至爲猖獗，被害者極衆；又見報載，六歲的女孩扒竊巨鑽，雖經警局往來京滬偵緝，而主犯已逃往香港云云，可見這個都市中的扒手們是如何的活躍，而其手段又是如何的高妙！筆者前幾天因爲去郵局購買郵票，竟亦蒙若輩又光顧一次，袋中五十萬元法幣橫遭攫去，眞是與該讀者不勝同感。</p>
<p>說「又蒙光顧一次」者，是因爲我從前曾屢受扒手們之覬覦，這一會是第三次了。第一次遠在十二年前，在法商二路電車上，是個暑天，當時穿的綢長衫，裘面的綢短衫被劃一縫，丟了一隻皮夾。失落的時候非常淸楚，但豈能人贓並獲呢？只能算了。幸喜錢物都拿在手裏，皮夾內除了照片鑰匙外是一無所有的。因此我便非常注意，自以爲吃過一次虧，學了一次乖了。</p>
<p>果然，第二次便有了經驗。勝利那一年的冬天，初返上海，在福州路搭十七路無軌電車，擁擠中覺到有些異樣，因此就用手週身一撫，儘力使勿與人接觸，一面將內衣袋住撳，下車後一看，絲棉短衫的袋上已照前一式一樣的劃有一縫，然而袋裏僅有的幾張關金券却幸未漏出。</p>
<p>在前些時報上揭載警局大舉淸除扒手，並令當衆表演其妙技時，我常將些二事向人說，認爲被扒終是自不小心之故。豈知言多必失，這一次可糟了。十四日晨九時，因便路，自往吳淞路郵局購些郵票，排在櫃擾前，略有些擠，陡覺袋中輕鬆，放手一摸，鈕扣已解，鈔票沒有了。自以爲有經驗，當時不動聲色，照樣買好郵票，到郵局門前的崗亭（現在馬路轉角處，此種崗亭頗多）去報失，那知崗警不大感興趣，後來聽說我是機關公務員，才勉强同進郵局，看了一看，對我說：「你倘早些宣佈，把門一關，然後我來，才可抓得到。現在，那裘去抓呢？」自然也祇得罷了。</p>
<p>說被扒的人都是自不小心是不錯的，誰敎我那天心神恍惚，漫不經心呢？倘使我能够注意集中，扒手們大槪仍舊是無所旅其技的；不過這都市生活的亂與　，大大地增加了他們的機會，却他是事實。</p>
<p>可怪的是，據我看來，這些扒手，至少是行莊郵局附近的扒手，是頗易捉除的。其所以迄今仍活躍而且變本加厲者，似乎是有些「非不能也」的因素在。假使我有空的話，我一定學學前些時也是報上所載的某學生的傻氣，在自來水筆上結了綫般，安排下釣餌，捉這麼一二個扒手來試試。</p>
<h3 id="c156">長面孔與圓面孔 <a href="#c156" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e156" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">156</a></h3>
<p>— 王定一</p>
<p>託得在國立幼師服務時，曾聽到陳鶴琴先生的一篇演講。他說：「人生有三賽，即：鏡子，手册和筆，與十字架。」意思是把鏡子來照照自己的臉，看看是否是圓的呢，或是長的？大凡圓的面孔便是愉快，長的面孔就是氣惱。這也就是說：你心中的喜，怒，哀，樂，表現到面孔上來給人家看了。</p>
<p>記者覺得在今天這個社會，氣惱的事，委實是罄竹難書，難怪社會各階層，時起騷擾，內心中大家都有肝火，只要一言不合，便將動起手來，於是乎大打出手，鬧得風雨滿城。</p>
<p>其實，這是不必要的。肝火旺了，固然一着即燒，但我們自已得時常服照鏡子，內心氣惱，面孔長掛，照樣拿去對付別人，對方原來是高高興興，想與你談談說說，一遇到你道副尊容，他也就不得不收起笑容，變得方正起來，於是乎本來是很融洽輕鬆的空氣，這一來便尶尬起來，甚至對方碰巧正在不高興，他也想發洩一下，看到你一副鐵板的而孔，正中下懷，一言不合，肝火直上，雙方就較量較量，結果是拚得二敗俱傷！</p>
<p>因此，我覺得長面孔是比較容易招人是非，而圓面孔則所謂春風滿面，一團和氣，人人見了喜愛，我們爲什麼一定要掛長了面孔，呌人家討厭，呌人家畏懼呢？</p>
<p>如果說是有問題，有氣惱，有困難，我們就不妨和和氣氣，誠誠懇懇，來與人家商量，想個辦法，來解決困難，消滅氣惱，何苦一定要掛長了面孔，認眞鬥氣呢？</p>

<p>第九章　洩漏機密（五四）</p>
<p>渚齋起先推辭有事，後來　卿告訴他，她母親由夭津回來，必須前去，並且等他來吃晚飯，渚齋只好答應下，那晚到顧宅之後，邀綺　出來，購妥地毯，　紈　同他到東亞樓吃晚飯，渚齋　說有應酬，送綺紈回家後，便匆匆趕到雲卿家裏。雲　的母親，一見渚齋，顯　格外親密，問長問短，對渚齋住在銀行宿舍，很不贊成，認爲在外而寄宿，一切沒人照應，是十分不便的，不如回家裹去，或是就搬來他家裏住。渚齋見老人家一股熱情看待，心　甚是感動，覺得章太太這次由夭津回來，對他態度，如此熾烈，當然是知道地和扈笙離婚，在他身上期望很切的，但是這問題未必能得良好答案，將來只怕要發生很大反響，所以見　太太熱列款待他，心中轉侷促不安，這晚上章太太特備了許多渚齋平日所愛吃的菜，　卿又殷勤勸飲，渚齋爲她母女熱情所激動，不由喝得酩酊大醉，酒後竟躺在沙發上，呼呼　去。章太太怕他閃了凉，命雲卿　住他到屋內安歇，　卿把他送到外書房內，一張小楊上，見他頸上領帶繫得緊緊的，隨手把牠解下，又把他上衣脫去，扶他師下，隨手把他的上衣，掛在　架上，　見由他衣袋內，落下一個紙包來，雲卿拾起一看，原來是一疊王興照相館冲洗的相片，一時生了好奇心，把紙包打開，抽出相片一看，原來是綺紈　奘的像片，有兩張是便衣，其中一張最爲刺目，是綺紈和渚齋合照的，綺紈坐在椅上，渚齋就坐在左邊椅上靠手，一手扶在綺紈肩上，狀至親　。雲卿看了這張像片，不由心中非常刺激，把她富有堅決性的嘴唇一咬，向渚齋看了一眼，恨不得把他拉起來，質問明白，站在屋中心，遲疑好一會，終覺得這人是醉了，此時就問他，他也未必能說出道理來，平日對渚齋的行動，本就覺得可疑，今天可以證明，他心裹確另有愛人，而所留戀的又是最可恨的綺紈，這事必須和他交涉一番。但是只拿這　張相片，和他交涉，理由還不充分，必須拿到他眞憑實據，捉住他的短處，質問一番，才能呌他心服。不過，經此一波折，彼此感情，也就中斷。雲卿想到這裹，由忿恨而轉心酸，不由流下淚來，再也不能支持，跑到自己屋裏，伏在床上，嗚嗚咽咽哭了起來。</p>
<h3 id="c158">忙中偷閒 <a href="#c158" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e158" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">158</a></h3>

<p>人生是匆忙而又緊張的，各有各的事業，各有各的前程，連都市中的享樂，如預先定購戲票，餐館中定座，在擁擠的舞池中找空座位等，也要你抽出一部份時間，把它當做一件正經事看，否則臨時遭遇閉門羹，更使你加倍掃興。</p>
<p>然而人生的可愛處，也許就在於百忙中的一點優閑。在火車疾駛中，從窗畔望見的一棵生意盎然的嫩枝，雖然匆匆一瞥，我們的心靈就可以得到一點潤濕。我們的工作，看來似乎每天忙得不可開交，但隨時隨地都能找到瞬息的優閑，以解脫身心束縛。</p>
<p>我會經在馬路上，發現一位有一面之交的哈佛大學畢業生，他是在一家美商公司內當跟街的，穿了挺括的西服，那時還在去年秋季，他一面嚼栗子，一面細讀街頭張貼的報紙。你可以說他缺乏紳士風度，然而他未嘗不是懂得人生樂趣的哲學家。</p>
<p>在另一次搭乘十路汽車時，鄰座有一個三十來歲的西洋婦人，挾了一個塞滿報紙，什物的手提包。服飾素樸，衣履却尚整潔，一眼看來，彷　是猶太籍的主婦模樣。她好像上鬧市去買東西，又像買了東西回去。她坐了一二分鐘，從手提包中摸出一本我國初小國語課本第一册來，一面看，一面在一本方格練習簿上，歪歪斜斜的寫起：「來讀書，大家來讀書……」看她悠然自得的態度，一似她在研究一門有趣的功課。</p>
<p>有時，即使在一個辦事認真的寫字間內，　管氣氛沉重，忙中偷閑的一絲生趣，終是不可抹煞的。一次，我往訪某主管經濟研究工作的洋人，他生著碧藍的眼珠，淡黃的頭髮，雪白的襯衫袖口，在淺藍色狹長條紋的西服袖子外，露出一大截。</p>
<p>我跟他將正事接洽就緒時，一個僕歐，捧了一個牛皮紙包進來，放在該洋人的桌上。他翻看了一下，對我說：「這是在去年十二月十二日從美國寄出的聖誕禮物，來通了」。這句話與我的正事全不相涉，可是多麼舍有濃厚的人情味，想來是他在百忙中願意跟我閑談幾分鐘的一種暗示吧。但令人抱憾的是：我限於時間，　着就跟他告別了。</p>

<p>古來高僧多矣，而大顚之各，獨掛人齒頰，至今不朽。潮人崇奉之尤甚，語及輒稱爲祖師，不敢或褻，其所以致此者，則韓昌黎三書之力也。使大顚而不遇昌黎，無此一段公案，亦早與草木同腐耳。然昌黎致天顚之三書，其眞僞聚訟紛紜，乃迄無定論。歐陽永叔取「非所戀著，則山林闐寂，與城廓無異」之句，以爲非韓公不能道。蘇東坡則謂三書爲或者妄撰，其詞凡鄙，雖退之家奴，亦無此語。歐陽與蘇，皆一代文章宗師，其所見不同如此。至朱晦庵則又謂「三書惟最後一篇，實有不成文理處，意或舊本亡逸，僧徒所記不眞，致有脫誤，歐公特觀其大概，故但取其所可取，而未暇及其所可疑，蘇公乃覺其所可疑，然亦不能察其爲誤，而直斥以爲凡鄙」。是斷最後一書爲僞，而前者二書果昌黎所作也。歐陽蘇朱三人之中，其斥以爲非者，實僅東坡一人，永叔晦庵乃皆謂出於昌黎無疑，所當辯者，惟最後一聲耳。然二書旣出昌黎之筆，一書之眞僞，又何足深云？屬元公（敦頤）題大顚堂壁詩，亦云：「退之自謂如夫子，原道深排佛老非，不識大顚何似者？數書珍重更留衣」。調侃昌黎尤至。要之昌黎與大顚遊，既已傾心之矣，斤斤於三書之辯，亦屬多事。昔曾云：「昌黎闢佛，宋需亦闢佛，然僧徒畏昌黎不畏宋儒，蓋昌黎未習佛敎，　之惟涉其組迹，爲世俗所易知，宋儒多涉獵佛經，　之必致其精　，非人人皆能愉，以昌黎所闢，特緇流之奉佛者耳，故僧徒畏昌黎不畏宋儒也」。此言最得其情，讀昌黎原道，可知不誣。昌黎惟素不窺佛旨，一且於寂寞海濱，有大顚者與之暢論幽微，昌黎不得不起崇信之念。不然，豈有「迭廬」「留衣」之舉？「造廬」「留衣」，固昌黎所不自諱，三書之有無，抑其末矣。</p>

<h3 id="e1">Chairman's Instruction to the North China Petition Delegation: Determined to Secure North China and the Northeast, Encouraging Northern Compatriots to Overcome Hardships Together <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 26th] Chairman Chiang summoned Liu Yaozhang, Xu Huidong, Shi Zizhou, Li Zhuchen, Ji Dianchuan, and other five members of the North China Petition Delegation at 11:30 AM on the 26th, inquiring about the situation in North China. They first outlined the current situation in North China, stating that the military and political situation was improving. After Fu Zuoyi took charge of military affairs in North China, the army entered Hebei from Chahar and Suiyuan, with strict discipline and high morale, possessing strong and mobile combat capabilities. The people have high hopes for Fu Zuoyi, hoping he can plan long-term and complete the entire task of suppressing the rebellion in North China. The Chairman nodded repeatedly when asked about this. Liu and others stated that there was a considerable foundation in the political sphere. They hoped that after Chu Xichun took office, he could devote himself to organizing the masses, cultivating self-defense forces, and supplementing and training cadres. In terms of the economy, increasing production remains an important fundamental solution. However, to resolve the current crisis, some appropriate measures are also necessary. They also used actual figures to point out that loans are not a source of speculative capital, especially in North China, and the government should have flexible solutions for this. In addition, both remittance and advance exchange should be opened to benefit the people and stabilize prices. They expressed gratitude for all parties' assistance in solving the food problem in the North, but purchasing grain in large quantities requires 450 billion, which is truly unbearable for the North. The Chairman immediately approved the Central Bank to advance the funds. In terms of transportation, they emphasized that the railway east of Tianjin must be unobstructed, and the strongholds of Tanggu, Tangshan, Luanxian, and Qinhuangdao must be firmly defended. The Chairman stated that he had paid attention to this matter and had dispatched strong troops to the North to ensure the security of the line, in order to facilitate the southward transport and export of Kailuan coal and other materials. Finally, the Chairman greatly appreciated their hard work on this trip, which greatly helped the central government and local governments understand each other, and the government's military and political measures, offering deep encouragement. The Chairman reiterated the government's determination to secure the Northeast and North China. He instructed them to tell the northern compatriots to strive hard and overcome difficulties together.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 26th] The Northern Petition Delegation, including Shi Zizhou, Xu Huidong, Li Zhuchen, and Ji Dianchuan, will take the night train to Shanghai on the 26th to return north. Liu Yaozhang is scheduled to go to Shanghai on the evening of the 27th.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 26th] It is learned that the government has decided on the principle of opening industrial loans after the fifteenth day of the first lunar month. Large factories will not be granted loans, while small factories will be handled with discretion. According to last year's experience, after industrial loans were opened before the Lunar New Year, they were used for speculative business, creating speculative capital and greatly affecting the market, causing prices to soar by 14.2 times last year. Therefore, this decision was made this year.</p>

Liu Yaozhang first represented the delegation to thank the media for their sympathy and support, and then stated: Thanks to the assistance of all parties, this trip has achieved considerable success. In addition to greatly benefiting the people's livelihood in the North, the most important thing is to boost the morale of the people in the North, promote mutual understanding between the central government and local governments, and emphasize the overall situation for all parties.

<p>Only Know Hardship</p>
<p>After Liu finished his report, Shi Zizhou and Li Zhuchen spoke successively. Shi, with his gray hair, said in a grateful tone that he would convey the sympathy and support of public opinion and other parties to hundreds of thousands of people in the North. They would be moved to tears upon hearing it. Li, with his qualifications as a southerner, said: Northerners are honest and only know how to work hard and are not good at complaining. Last year, they received less than 50 billion in government work relief and advance loans, including those in arrears. He emphasized that the source of speculative capital is not industrial loans, especially not the pitifully small industrial loans in the North. The biggest source is war. As for how military expenditures become speculative capital, he said, "No need to say more." In addition, those with a little wealth deposit money in commercial firms, accumulating small amounts into large sums, which is also considerable. Therefore, stopping industrial loans and tightening credit only hurts the industrial sector, and the northern manufacturers who have always been law-abiding suffer the most. However, the government still insists on this decided policy and will not change it until after the Lantern Festival. After Li finished speaking, Liu Yaozhang briefly described their visit to the Chairman and the reasons for the withdrawal from Shijiazhuang. They dispersed around 4:00 PM.</p>

<p>19,000 Metric Tons to be Shipped to China Before End of Next Month</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Bangkok, 26th] According to the US Embassy here: The US has purchased rice worth US$5 million from Siam, following the results of negotiations between the British Ambassador and the Siamese government, to be used as food relief for China. This amount is allocated to China by the International Emergency Food Council this year. This rice purchase plan began a few days before the Siamese coup in November last year. The US$5 million required for the rice purchase will be deducted from the US$27.7 million of the US aid to China program after the end of UNRRA. This approximately 19,000 metric tons of rice is expected to arrive in China before the end of next month.</p>

<p>[Central News Agency, Qingdao, 26th] US Navy General Keck was originally scheduled to retire and return to the country at the beginning of next month. Now, because his successor, General Badger, has not yet arrived in China, Keck will postpone his return to the United States until March.</p>
<h3 id="e6">Control Yuan Discusses Civil Servant Treatment: Advocating Monthly Adjustment of Index <a href="#e6" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c6" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">6</a></h3>
<p>Decided to Suggest the National Government Reconsider</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 26th] The Control Yuan held a discussion meeting on the 26th. Chairman Miao Peicheng discussed the matter of improving the treatment of public school personnel, and Yu Shude and others proposed that the newly revised method for adjusting the treatment of public school personnel is to adjust it once every three months. The in-kind allocation system will be cancelled, but in fact, the income in the first month may be slightly more than the sum of the salary multiple, living expenses, and in-kind allocation difference in the past. There will be no possibility of an increase in the second month, which is less than the increase in the difference in the past, not to mention the third month. Therefore, if the newly revised method for adjusting the treatment of public school personnel cancels in-kind allocations, public school personnel will suffer a loss. This is by no means the original intention of the Control Yuan and other agencies to strive to improve the treatment of public school personnel. Therefore, it is advocated that the index should be adjusted monthly to match the name of the cost of living index. Otherwise, the in-kind allocation system should be retained to maintain the livelihood of public school personnel. All the members unanimously agreed, and it was decided to make this opinion into a formal recommendation and submit it to the National Government for reconsideration.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 26th] Regarding the treatment of police officers, according to the Ministry of Internal Affairs: The treatment of police officers throughout the country is based on the provisions of the Provisional Measures for the Implementation of the Police Officer System, paying the treatment from the 16th to the 8th grade of appointment. The living allowance is the same as that of ordinary civil servants.</p>
<h3 id="e7">Sanhe Control Committee Members Visit Economic Council to Investigate Foreign Exchange Allocation <a href="#e7" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c7" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">7</a></h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 26th] Control Committee members Yu Shude, Miao Peicheng, and Li Xiaoting visited Gu Yu, Deputy Secretary-General of the National Economic Council, on the afternoon of the 26th to inquire about the allocation of foreign exchange for imported materials in the fourth quarter. Gu replied: The allocation and approval of foreign exchange are handled directly by the Executive Yuan, but the National Economic Council first examines it before approval, and the Transportation Control Commission is now responsible. Therefore, the allocation and approval of foreign exchange is not decided by the National Economic Council. Yu and others often put forward opinions, hoping that the government can take into account the general survival of factories in various places when allocating foreign exchange. For example, Tianjin only received 3.4% of the foreign exchange in the past, which is really too little, and hopes that the National Economic Council can provide relevant information on the allocation of foreign exchange in the fourth quarter. Gu often agreed to transfer it to the Transportation Control Commission for handling. Yu and others also went to the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry in the morning to report on the investigation progress of various departments. They will urge the departments to submit written materials quickly on the 28th to make the investigation immediate and practical.</p>
<h3 id="e8">KMT Central Standing Committee Passes Resolution to Postpone the Seventh National Congress; List of National Representatives to be Announced, etc., to be Discussed Today <a href="#e8" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c8" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">8</a></h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 26th] The postponement of the Seventh National Congress of the Kuomintang has been discussed and decided by the Central Standing Committee on the 26th. The Fourth Plenary Session of last year resolved that the Seventh National Congress would be held on May 5, 1937. According to regulations, a notice should be issued three months before the meeting. The Central Standing Committee proposed it for discussion today, believing that the time was pressing and there was insufficient preparation, and decided to postpone it. However, the date of the postponement has not yet been decided. Regarding the issue of concessions to friendly parties and mutual concessions between comrades of our party in the election of National Representatives, the Central Standing Committee proposed it for discussion again on the 26th and decided to hand it over to the election team for further study.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 26th] The issue of the announcement of the list of National Representatives and the signing of the eligibility of nominated National Representatives was discussed for a long time at the Central Standing Committee on the 26th, but no conclusion was reached. According to statistics, those nominated by the Central Committee and elected accounted for 75% of the total, and the remaining 25% failed to be elected. Those who sign the nomination should be elected based on the number of votes, but they are bound by the provisions of the supplementary regulations for the election of the State Council, so their eligibility for election cannot be determined. At the same time, further discussions were held on the methods of concession to friendly parties, but no conclusion was reached. It was decided to convene a comprehensive team in the afternoon of the 27th to submit the list for discussion before sending it to the Central Standing Committee for a final decision. It is also heard that people from both the Democratic and Youth parties insisted on the number of candidates originally nominated. The Youth Party proposed the issue of "the party concedes the total amount to the party," that is, it is not a matter of a certain individual conceding to another individual, but a matter of the Kuomintang conceding to friendly parties. Therefore, under any circumstances, it must concede to the two parties. At the same time, if it is indeed impossible to be elected in a certain place, then the Kuomintang members must withdraw and concede to friendly parties in another place, so the total number often remains unchanged. People from both the Democratic and Youth parties also stated that the list of elected candidates must be agreed by both parties before it can be published, otherwise it will not be recognized. These issues will be discussed again at the meeting on the 27th.</p>

<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 26th] The Federation of Signers and Nominees of National Representatives and the central nominees who failed to be elected petitioned the Central Standing Committee in two different formations on the 26th. Representatives of the signers, such as Ma Wencao, were notified by the Central Party Headquarters in advance to go for talks. They were often received by Ma Chaojun, He Zhonghan, etc. They still proposed that the standard for election should be based on the majority of votes. Ma and others promised to convey it to the Central Standing Committee. Wang Qijiang received the central nominees who failed to be elected. They stated that if the Central Committee does not give them effective support, they will personally visit the President to ask for instructions, and then telegraphically invite the nationally nominated candidates by the Central Committee to come to Nanjing before March 10.</p>

<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 26th] China and Britain continued to have contact in negotiations on the 26th. British Embassy Counselor Rabaji visited Yin Baoyu, Director of the European Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, in the afternoon for about half an hour. The content is unknown. Our side is still waiting for the British reply on the Kowloon City issue and is still verifying the facts and considering the British note on the Shameen incident in Guangzhou. It is learned that before the British side responds to our protest on the Kowloon City issue, our side may not express any decision on the Shameen incident in Guangzhou. However, the British Embassy has not yet stated that they have received specific instructions from the British government regarding the Kowloon City issue. The development of negotiations on these two incidents seems to be pending. The consultations between the two sides may eventually be resolved at the same time.</p>

They continued to pursue them for days and finally recovered the bandit stronghold of Dazhongji, killing and capturing many bandits and seizing a large number of supplies. On the 25th, the National Army swept around Dazhongji. After the bandits wantonly destroyed it, they fled in embarrassment. It is estimated that they burned down all the power generation and textile machinery and a large number of cotton, oil, cloth, and grain in the cooperative societies and Huainan Industrial Society in Yuhua Town and Xinpu Town. Note: The communist bandits' old strongholds in northern Jiangsu were Hede Town and Dazhongji, which have both been destroyed successively.</p>

<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 26th] Yi Min, Director of the New Frontier Construction Department, and his wife visited Chairman Chiang and his wife at 4:30 PM on the 26th. The Chairman expressed his appreciation for the Xinjiang construction plan previously proposed by Yi. He promised to allocate 50 billion yuan to enable Yi to promote the plan to construct Xinjiang. At the same time, because the Xinjiang Governor's Office had confiscated the property of the people of Xinjiang in the past, the Chairman's approval of this large amount of money is equivalent to compensating the people of Xinjiang for their losses. Yi believes that this is of great importance to the morale of the people of Xinjiang. As for Yi's plan, he suggested organizing a Xinjiang Construction Guidance Group, with Lin Jirong as the leader. Lin is currently in Shanghai and cannot go to Xinjiang due to an incident. He is currently looking for a deputy leader to represent him.</p>

<p>[United Press, Washington, 25th] The private research organization, the US Foreign Policy Association, published a report by member Ray on the 25th, estimating that the total value of major US aid to China after the war was US$2,278 million. Ray was the former director of the UNRRA China Branch and is currently a key member of the Marshall Plan Review Committee. According to his estimate, US military aid to China since the Japanese surrender was $844,729,000, most of which was military lend-lease materials and services, totaling $702,564,000 by the end of June 1947. A total of $970,107,000 was used for relief, reconstruction, and trade promotion. The largest item was the US contribution of $492,950,000 to the UNRRA relief plan, followed by the sale of surplus army materials, totaling $270,000,000. Under the heading of financial assistance, there was $150,000,000, which was the balance of the $500,000,000 war loan in 1942. The amount of educational and charitable funds was $30,450,000. The total of all items was US$2,278 million. Secretary of State Marshall's plan for continued aid to China, which was proposed last November, stipulates that it is US$300 million. Some parties claim that the plan may be announced in a few days, and the number may be expanded.</p>

<p>Most Residents Lack Coal for Heating; Bunkers Are Densely Distributed and Security Is Tight</p>
<p>[United Press, Beiping, 26th] The lives of most of the 1.5 million residents of Shenyang are extremely miserable. Except for necessary places such as military facilities, police stations, large hotels, and the residences and offices of foreign consular personnel, there are no electric lights. A curfew is in effect from 6:00 PM, making life even more unpleasant. Most restaurants close at 5:00 PM, and people have nowhere to go except home. At home, they can only use candles and kerosene lamps for lighting. Few can afford to use coal for heating, resulting in cold and unhappiness. Business is slow, and most shops close their doors at 3:00 PM. Some have closed permanently due to business failures or the owners leaving. Shenyang is preparing for street battles, with bunkers densely distributed and troops stationed everywhere. Military installations, police stations, wireless telegraph offices, and warehouses are all protected by barbed wire. Many factories show signs of having their machinery dismantled by the Soviets and being looted. Most of the doors, windows, and roof tiles are gone. The poverty of the residents is evident everywhere, with some selling all their indoor furniture. Occasionally, one sees共prisoners, some wearing military uniforms and others in plain clothes, being escorted to concentration camps by guards. Japanese houses have all been requisitioned for official use. The South Manchuria Railway Company is now the headquarters of the Northeast National Army, with excellent buildings and heating facilities. The former Yamamoto Hotel has been renamed the Railway Hotel, also with heating and electricity, and plenty of hot water. Bathing is available every Saturday.</p>

<h3 id="e22">Hasten the Convening of a Peace Conference with Japan! <a href="#e22" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c22" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">22</a></h3>
<p>Following the U.S. Army's request for $500 million in aid to Japan, the U.S. submitted a detailed memorandum to the Far Eastern Commission in Washington, D.C., stating the necessity of helping Japan become self-sufficient and requesting the approval of all Allied nations. Although we have not yet received sufficient information to ascertain the attitudes of the Allied nations in general, we in China, having suffered from Japanese aggression for a long time and with particularly severe harm, have already expressed concerns about MacArthur's lenient policy toward Japan. The current news naturally makes us even more uneasy. We need not delve into how the Far Eastern Commission in Washington, D.C. will deliberate on this matter; from China's standpoint, since a peace treaty with Japan has not yet been signed, the further expression of aid to Japan seems inappropriate in terms of both sentiment and reason. The generosity of the United States towards Japan has clearly exceeded the scope that a victorious nation should extend to a nation that still holds an enemy status. Therefore, we believe that whatever policy is adopted towards post-war Japan, a prerequisite is the convening of a peace conference with Japan and the signing of a peace treaty with Japan. Hastening the convening of a peace conference with Japan should be our current goal.</p>
<p>Originally, the issue of convening a preparatory meeting for a peace treaty with Japan had been fraught with waves and dangers in the correspondence between China, the United States, the United Kingdom, and the Soviet Union, and it had recently reached a stalemate. If this stalemate cannot be broken, it will inevitably lead to a split among the Allied nations. Judging from the current signs, it is difficult to break the stalemate. The United States and the Soviet Union each have their own plans, and only China is isolated and hesitating amidst the two extremes. The government is distressed, and its diplomacy appears to lack vigor; the people are restless, and despite declarations and discussions, they lack support. However, in any case, we must seek to break the stalemate in order to hasten the convening of a peace conference with Japan.</p>
<p>Now, let us first examine the attitudes of China, the United States, the United Kingdom, and the Soviet Union. The four countries have never been in agreement on the procedural issues of the Japanese peace conference, and there are at least three different opinions among them.</p>
<p>The United States and the United Kingdom hold one opinion. The United States proposed its opinion in August 1947, and it has not changed or been revised since then. Regarding the procedure for the Japanese peace conference, the United States advocates that the eleven nations participating in the Far Eastern Commission jointly draft the peace treaty and vote on it by a two-thirds majority. The key to this proposal is to abolish the veto power and oppose using the foreign ministers' conference as a procedure for discussing the Japanese peace treaty. After the Canberra Conference, the United Kingdom adopted a consistent attitude, especially with Australia's active stance. The addition of Pakistan and Burma to the Far Eastern Commission makes it clear that the United States and the United Kingdom want to gain an advantage in procedure by a majority and to abolish the principle of unanimity among the four powers in substance.</p>
<p>The Soviet Union holds another opinion. The Soviet Union rejected the original proposal of the United States. It advocated that the foreign ministers of China, the United States, the United Kingdom, and the Soviet Union be responsible for drafting the Japanese peace treaty and that the veto power be reserved in procedure. The Soviet Union's purpose is to use the existence of the foreign ministers' conference as an institution for creating peace treaties around the world and to use the weapon of veto power to resist the diplomatic advantage of the Anglo-American front. On November 28, 1947, the Soviet Union replied to the Chinese note, agreeing with the Chinese suggestion that all decisions on the Japanese peace treaty must be agreed upon by the representatives of China, the United States, the Soviet Union, and the United Kingdom. However, it emphasized that before the preparatory meeting, the four powers should hold a foreign ministers' conference in China to discuss the preparations for the Japanese peace conference. On December 5, the Chinese Minister of Foreign Affairs again informed the Soviet Union, stating that the Far Eastern Commission should be responsible for drafting the Japanese peace treaty, and hoped that the Soviet Union would agree to China's compromise proposal. On December 30, Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov replied to our note, without changing his previous position. However, he advocated that member states of the Far Eastern Commission other than the four powers should participate in the work of the various committees and subcommittees that may be established for the Japanese peace conference. This clearly shows that the procedure for the Japanese peace conference advocated by the Soviet Union is the foreign ministers' conference, and only the foreign ministers' conference is responsible for preparing the drafting of the Japanese peace treaty.</p>
<p>Outside of these two factions, China is conciliatory and intermediate. The Chinese opinion has been changed by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and the final version should be based on the content of the note sent to the United States and the Soviet Union on November 17, 1947, which suggests two points: 1. A preparatory meeting for the Japanese peace treaty should be composed of member states of the Far Eastern Commission, and the meeting should be convened on a date agreed upon by China, the United States, the United Kingdom, and the Soviet Union, in order to draft a peace treaty and discuss matters related to the convening of the final peace conference; 2. Voting at the meeting should be by a majority of the member states of the meeting, but the majority must include the unanimous votes of China, the United States, the United Kingdom, and the Soviet Union. The key to this proposal is to maintain the organizational spirit of the Far Eastern Commission and to retain the veto power while upholding the principle of "unanimous consent." Therefore, the Chinese opinion is a reconciliation of the differences between the United States, the United Kingdom, and the Soviet Union, and it can also be said to be a revision of the above two factions. The United Kingdom has twice expressed its refusal to the Chinese proposal, and the Soviet Union and the Chinese proposal have in common the reservation of the veto power, but the opinions of China and the Soviet Union still have considerable differences on the issue of the four countries versus the eleven countries.</p>
<p>Among these three divergent opinions, the United States and the United Kingdom are in agreement, while China and the Soviet Union are each isolated and not entirely consistent. This is the key to the stalemate in the preparatory meeting for the Japanese peace treaty. In the middle of this, China is neither generously supported by the Soviet Union, nor does it incur the aversion of the United States and the United Kingdom. Despite thinking that its advocacy has a grand banner and a proper drum, it still cannot avoid being isolated. The government and the people feel the same distress, and diplomacy does not show any vigor.</p>
<p>Chinese public opinion calls on the United States, the United Kingdom, and the Soviet Union to use wisdom and broaden their horizons to seek compromise. The voice is loud, but it does not receive the slightest response. In fact, the politicians of the United States, the United Kingdom, and the Soviet Union have well-thought-out plans. The United Nations General Assembly is interfering with various issues in the Far East (especially the Korean issue), and the discussion of the Liaodong Economic Conference shows clearly the Soviet Union's attitude that it is unwilling to bow its head under the diplomatic advantage of the Anglo-American front. Its attitude towards any issue is uncooperative. In the Soviet Union's view, the Japanese peace treaty is also of great importance. In the current situation, the longer the Japanese peace conference is delayed, the more beneficial it will be to the Soviet Union; the more free and convenient the Soviet Union's attitude will be towards a Japanese peace conference without Soviet participation. As for the United States and the United Kingdom, if they do not get Soviet cooperation, the Japanese peace conference will still be convened. Judging from the current trend of the United States controlling Japan, it is also possible to restore a state of peace with Japan unilaterally, without concluding any treaty. Although this is not a conventional way to end a war, there are precedents in history. The war between France and Mexico in 1867 ended in this way; and the end of the war between the United States and Germany in World War I was that the U.S. President approved the resolutions of both houses in July 1921, declaring the restoration of peace with Germany. It is possible for the United States to unilaterally make peace with Japan, but the reason why it has not done so now is that, on the one hand, the Soviet Union's offensive on the peace conference has not yet reached its peak, and on the other hand, it is expecting to fully win over China in a situation that is favorable to China. If China insists on "not participating in a peace conference without the Soviet Union," then the United States is very likely to be forced to unilaterally make peace with Japan. Judging from the rise of Stricker's anti-compensation theory, it clearly shows that the United States only wants Japan to become a bird and does not need Japan's compensation. Judging from Japan's secret plan for counter-demands in the peace treaty, as long as it does not have to pay compensation or pays less compensation, it may as well let it go. Therefore, it is even more convincing that the United States and Japan may make peace unilaterally. If the United States does this, the United Kingdom will not object. What Australia and the Philippines are fighting for is a small amount of compensation, and the issue is not serious.</p>
<p>In this bad situation, China's situation is the worst. No matter how skillful we are in dealing with it, we cannot "avoid being affected." In fact, China cannot make peace with Japan alone. First, it is difficult to enjoy the rights of a victorious nation by making peace alone. China's separate peace with Germany in August 1919 is a clear example. Second, China is bound by the "Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship and Alliance" of August 1945, which prohibits both sides from making peace with Japan separately and establishes a military alliance. Therefore, from China's standpoint, it should hope for the stalemate in the preparatory meeting for the Japanese peace treaty to be broken, and it does not want to see the Allied nations split or the United States make peace with Japan alone. Therefore, we hope that wise American politicians will take responsibility for rebuilding peace in the Far East, break the current stalemate, and follow one of the following two paths:</p>
<p>1. Accept China's compromise proposal and maintain the principle of unanimous consent of the four powers at the peace conference;</p>
<p>2. Convene a foreign ministers' conference of the four powers to attempt to discuss the content of the Japanese peace treaty. If the four powers can substantially coordinate, then the formal Japanese peace conference of the eleven Far Eastern nations can be resolved at the end.</p>
<p>Other than that, the stalemate cannot be broken; continuing it is detrimental to the cooperation of the Allied nations. We do not want to see the dangerous situation in Europe repeated in the Far East, and we especially do not want Japan to reap the benefits of counter-demands in the peace treaty in this contradiction between the United States and the Soviet Union. In today's situation, it is most beneficial to Japan: the United States and the United Kingdom are jumping, the Soviet Union is resisting, China is annoyed, and Japan is laughing! If "Japan fails in the war and wins in peace," that would be a complete defeat in strategy and political strategy for the Allied nations!</p>

<h3 id="e24">Control of Cotton Yarn and Cloth Decided to Be Implemented Regionally <a href="#e24" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c24" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">24</a></h3>
<p>Detailed Rules to Be Announced After Finalization</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 26th] In order to thoroughly implement control, the Cotton Yarn and Cloth Control Committee has decided to implement the unified purchase and sale, agency spinning and weaving methods regionally across the country. The regional methods will be announced in Shanghai after the six articles of the detailed rules for the implementation of the control methods are announced. It is reported that it will first be implemented in the Jiangsu-Zhejiang-Anhui region, the Wuhan region, and the Tianjin region. The Shanghai area will be managed by the Cotton Yarn and Cloth Control Committee, while offices will be set up in major locations in each region to handle unified purchase and sale matters. The offices for the Jiangsu-Zhejiang-Anhui region have been decided to be set up in Nanjing, Wuxi, Jiangyin, and other places.</p>

The current transportation volume on this road is about 1,000 tons per month.</p>
<h3 id="e26">Tianjin Food Problem: Relief Measures Decided <a href="#e26" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c26" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">26</a></h3>
<p>Liang Ziqing Discusses the Process of Negotiating in Beijing</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper News] Liang Ziqing, Secretary-General of the Tianjin Municipal Government, went to Shanghai via Beijing to solve the Tianjin food problem, and has repeatedly negotiated with the central authorities on the relation. It has now been completed, and he came to Shanghai from Beijing a few days ago. He is scheduled to return to Tianjin within days. Yesterday, he especially met with the press in this city and described in detail the local situation and economic situation in Pingjin, and the main points of Liang's speech are excerpted as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e27">Provide Four Major Principles <a href="#e27" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c27" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">27</a></h3>
<p>The main task of this trip to Beijing is to contribute four major principles for solving the Tianjin food problem to the central government. The task is to assist the North China Petition Group in providing the central government with five suggestions for relieving the economy of North China. The four major principles for solving the Tianjin food problem are: First, try to be self-reliant and request loans from the central government to purchase miscellaneous grains in the Northwest. It is estimated that the surplus of miscellaneous grains in the Northwest is about 10,000 tons, while Pingjin needs 17,000 tons each per month. Therefore, even if all 50,000 tons are purchased, it will only be enough for the food of ten thousand Jin for two months. The second is to request the expansion of the transshipment quota of flour in the Yangtze River area, and it is best to abolish the quota system. The third is to strive for the proportion of the 115,000 tons of food in the US relief agreement allocated to Pingjin. Regarding this point, the negotiation has already yielded results, and Director Miao of the Distribution Committee has promised to allocate 50,000 tons of flour to relieve Pingjin. The fourth is that Tianjin plans to exchange export materials for foreign food.</p>
<h3 id="e28">Central Government's Two Measures <a href="#e28" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c28" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">28</a></h3>
<p>Negotiation Process: In terms of food, the central government's emergency measures are to transport 300,000 bags of flour to Jin before the Lunar New Year. The usual measures are to allocate 500,000 bags of flour to Tianjin every month starting from February of this year (excluding the quota for public officials and teachers). In addition, there is no limit to the transportation of miscellaneous grains from the Yangtze River area to the north. President Zhang of the National Bank has also agreed to give the Tianjin and Shanghai grain purchase general preferential exchange rates. The Ministry of Food has decided to thoroughly investigate the matter of charging a license fee of 150,000 yuan per bag for the transport of flour from the south to the north.</p>
<h3 id="e29">The Difficulty of Implementing a Linked System <a href="#e29" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c29" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">29</a></h3>
<p>In order to solve the grain problem in Tianjin, a proposal has been made to implement a local import-export linkage system on a trial basis in Tianjin. This would involve exchanging Tianjin's exports, such as bristles, walnuts, soybeans, peanuts, sausage casings, and camel hair, for essential grains. It is estimated that under normal circumstances, these exports could generate US$10 million in foreign exchange each quarter. This amount could import at least 53,000 tons of flour, which would solve Tianjin's grain shortage for April and May. Currently, because imported goods must be purchased from the black market and exports are settled at the official exchange rate, the quarterly export value is only about US$2 million. If a partial import-export linkage system can be implemented, it can not only solve Tianjin's grain problem but also generate an additional US$8 million in foreign exchange for the country each quarter. At the same time, in order to take into account the central government's principles of controlling foreign exchange and overall allocation, a special exchange settlement method is proposed. However, Mr. Zhang, the President of the National Bank, believes that since all regions of the country have foreign exchange income, it is not possible to create a fragmented situation by allowing Tianjin to implement a partial trial. Moreover, import-export linkage would inevitably lead to an increase in imports and an increase in the price of export goods, causing a rampant black market for US dollars. Therefore, he believes that it is not feasible to consider.</p>
<h3 id="e30">Ordering and Purchasing Finished Products <a href="#e30" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c30" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">30</a></h3>
<p>Regarding the issue of opening up industrial loans, Li Zhuchen, Chairman of the North China Industrial Association, has proposed four points: 1. Increase industrial loan interest rates; 2. Change the method of documentary bills; 3. Relax the loan amount to be sufficient for one month's turnover; 4. Extend the deadline to February or March. As a result of negotiations, the central government agreed to purchase finished products through orders. Mr. Liang particularly pointed out that last year, Tianjin alone received only 5.12 billion yuan in industrial loans for the entire year, which is vastly different from Shanghai, creating a state of economic bias. He sincerely hopes that this can be improved this year.</p>

For the benefit of the subscribers, the Ministry of Finance has not only instructed the finance bureaus of various provinces and cities to announce separately that all subscribers must bring their original temporary receipts to the original handling bank to exchange for bond certificates before the end of March of the 37th year, and those who fail to do so after the deadline will be considered as donations to the country and returned to the national treasury for cancellation, but also issued a notice to inform the public.</p>

<h3 id="e38">An Important Page in Ending the Great War: The Surrender of the "Kwantung Army" From Siberian Captivity Back to Japan <a href="#e38" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c38" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">38</a></h3>
<p>— Interviews with Captives</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Tokyo Correspondence] The Second World War has long passed, but how the arrogant and barbaric "Kwantung Army" quickly disintegrated during the surrender process of Japan remains a mystery to the world. Recently, a group of Kwantung Army prisoners of war who were sent back to Japan from Siberia arrived in Tokyo. Reporters interviewed them, and they revealed the situation at the time. Although it has become a thing of the past, it still has a certain value. The following is their conversation:</p>
<p>After Germany announced its surrender to the Allied Forces (April 1945), the Soviet Union began secretly transporting its troops to the Far East. By mid-July, the situation became particularly tense. The Siberian Railway openly entered a state of wartime transportation, and the situation along the Manchurian border became increasingly tense day by day. Although the Nomonhan Incident had occurred before, the Soviet Union had never assembled such a strong force. Among them, weapons, ammunition, food, materials, etc., were about five years of combat expenses. The Soviet Union had completed its plan to concentrate its forces in key areas of the country within a few months.</p>
<p>The entire Japanese army on Suban Island was annihilated, and the American forces landed on Okinawa Island and launched a more fierce offensive. In order to prepare for the defense of the Japanese mainland, the elite Kwantung Army troops in Northeast China were constantly transferred to Korea and Japan. Their strength was greatly reduced, but in preparation for the Soviet Union's attack, all of us held the spirit of "gyokusai" (honorable death) and actively constructed new defensive works along the line of the Xing'an Mountains - Muling - Laoyeling - Dunhua. At the same time, we used the mountainous areas to continuously build underground factories day and night to prepare for a long-term defense.</p>
<p>On August 8, near the front of the ×th Army (Bandaihe), about 200 Soviet soldiers illegally crossed the border. Because our army did not receive orders from above, we temporarily withdrew. On the morning of August 9, the Soviet army began attacking various places such as Hailar, Hunchun, and Dongning on the front of the 5th Army, and both sides entered a state of combat. At the same time, the military headquarters continued to report that the Soviet army had begun attacking various places such as Hailar, Hunchun, and Dongning. Subsequently, the major cities of Harbin, Fengtian, and Gongzhuling began to be bombarded and bombed. From that day on, Northeast China, which had always been considered a safe zone, unfortunately entered a combat zone.</p>
<p>However, in terms of troop strength, the Soviet Union's Far East Army at this time had 1.5 million, while we only had half that number, about 700,000 (34 divisions and 9 brigades). The Soviet Union had more than 5,000 aircraft, while we only had 500, of which 300 were still being repaired, so only 200 were actually usable. Furthermore, the Soviet Union had about 5,000 tanks, while we only had one regiment of tank units.</p>
<p>Most of our elite troops had been transferred to the mainland, and those who remained were mostly older, weaker supplementary soldiers around the age of 40. Therefore, each army could only hold its own position and wait for the Soviet army's attack in great panic. The Soviet Union's main attack was aimed at encircling the entire "Manchuria." With the cooperation of mechanized units and excellent air force, they launched a fan-shaped rapid attack across the entire territory. Therefore, only a few days after the war, the situation had reached Far Eastern Spring. At the same time, the Soviet Navy was actively conducting landing operations on the northern Korean front.</p>
<p>At that time, almost all cities that were military, political, and transportation centers were bombed. The major military and political figures of "Manchuria" retreated and evacuated one after another. Puyi, the puppet emperor of Manchukuo, was escorted by the military and left Changchun on a special court train on August 13, arriving in Tonghua on the 14th. He resided in the private residence of the president of a certain coal mine. At this time, an underground palace was being built day and night on the eastern side of the road.</p>
<p>Such scenes of bombing, panic, evacuation, and chaos were rare in history. At the same time, strange rumors spread throughout Changchun: Japan has requested a ceasefire from the Allied Forces Command. The diplomatic aspect of the puppet Manchukuo has secretly negotiated a peace treaty with the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>On August 15, the news of the surrender was broadcast by radio, but we had not yet received orders from the headquarters and were still carrying out combat operations. The headquarters convened an emergency meeting to carefully discuss the future actions of the military. At that time, there were both proponents of peace and war, but the majority were proponents of war. As a result, the leading group completely eliminated the will to cease fire. The three army headquarters (China Expeditionary Army, South Seas Expeditionary Army, and Kwantung Army) simultaneously issued strong telegrams to various places: believing that the morale of the soldiers was strong and the will of the central leadership was firm, holding the spirit of "gyokusai," overcoming difficult key points, and thoroughly annihilating the British and Americans. Furthermore, the young staff officers of the military headquarters used the following three reasons to encourage their subordinates: 1. Soldiers and citizens should be educated in the spirit of Nanko's loyalty and patriotism. Absolutely no contamination of the glorious history of Japan for three thousand years with the stain of surrender is allowed. Eastern Asia must fight to the last soldier. 2. The Peace Edict is not the true intention of the Emperor but a forgery by treacherous officials beside the Emperor. Rapidly dispatch a plane back to Nanjing to eliminate the traitors. 3. The 2.5 million spiritual defense forces on the Japanese mainland are on standby in excellent condition and will surely fight a decisive battle with the British and Americans.</p>
<p>In this extremely noisy and uneasy meeting, with the emphasis on war, the Kwantung Army Chief of Staff Hayashi and Commander-in-Chief Yamada Otsuzo tearfully pleaded with their subordinates: "Obeying the Imperial Order is the duty of a soldier. I hope that the officers and soldiers will abide by the Imperial Rescript, cease combat operations, and quickly disarm."</p>
<p>On August 17, the combat consciousness of each army was still extremely strong. Generals who transmitted surrender orders were considered "Soviet spies" and were killed with a single stroke of a knife. It was not until the 18th that combat operations gradually ceased.</p>
<p>Puyi, the puppet emperor of Manchukuo residing in Chebian Road, "informed" the military headquarters of the ceasefire agreement and requested "His Majesty's intention" regarding future actions. Puyi believed that it would be better to reside in Japan, so he urgently escorted the palace to Tian Airport, preparing to take a plane to Japan. However, just a moment later, dozens of Soviet fighter planes had landed at the same airport. Later, Puyi was guarded by the Soviet army, and we also immediately disarmed, experiencing a dark and hopeless life of defeat, living as forced laborers in Siberia. (Chen Luo)</p>

<h3 id="e39">France Announces Currency Devaluation, Establishes Free Foreign Exchange Market, Declares that this Move is Transitional, Close Technical Cooperation between Britain and France to Avoid Adverse Consequences <a href="#e39" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c39" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">39</a></h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] London, 26th Broadcast: Paris News, French Prime Minister Schuman told the National Assembly today that in order to keep the country's factories open and prevent unemployment, the devaluation of the franc is necessary. The National Assembly began debating the franc devaluation issue today, and its decision will have far-reaching implications.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 25th] The French government issued a statement on the 25th announcing the official new exchange rate of the franc and the free buying and selling of foreign exchange, and explained its reasons for taking this step. The statement stated, "In order to achieve its goal of stabilizing the economy, the French government has previously implemented anti-inflation measures. The steps taken today have made the adjustment of the exchange rate necessary to complete these measures." The French government was initially hesitant and unable to decide whether it should devalue the franc or adopt a more flexible plan, but it finally abandoned the former method because the French government believed that it was too early to set a fixed exchange rate that could meet all needs at this time. An exchange rate that is too low will not achieve the goal of stabilizing the economy, and an exchange rate that is too high will hinder the French economy. The French government's statement also stated, "A transitional period of free buying and selling is necessary to allow foreign exchange to achieve its natural balance. The French government firmly believes that its actions will not hinder the efforts of other countries to achieve the same goals. The International Monetary Fund Conference approved important parts of the French plan, but it refused to approve the entire plan, which the French government deeply regrets. The French government is prepared to take technical measures and implement coordinated controls to avoid uneasiness among countries whose currencies are not convertible."</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 25th] The French government issued a statement on the evening of the 25th stating that the French Foreign Exchange Equalization Fund has stipulated a new exchange rate for the franc, with one US dollar equal to 214.392 francs and one British pound equal to 864 francs. The steps announced by the French government are two: 1. The French Foreign Exchange Equalization Fund will allow the franc exchange rate to float by 80% from January 26. The exchange rate of the French franc against other currencies in the franc zone will remain unchanged, and the exchange rate of the French rupee against the US dollar and the British pound will also remain at the original price. 2. In addition to the official exchange rate, foreign exchange can be freely bought and sold under the following conditions: (A) Half of the foreign exchange earned from French exports is sold to the Foreign Exchange Equalization Fund at the official price, and the other half can be sold on the free market. Other foreign exchange, such as that from trade surpluses, foreign funds flowing into France, and foreign exchange held by foreign tourists in France, can also be sold on the free market. (B) The foreign exchange obtained from free trading can be used to pay for imported goods, but other imported goods necessary for the French economy are settled at the official exchange rate. (C) The trading price of foreign exchange in the free market should be allowed to rise and fall according to the amount of supply and demand.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 25th] According to announcements from Paris and London, Britain and France will immediately begin technical cooperation to reduce the repercussions caused by the relationship between the sterling area and the franc area. France also stated that the measures officially announced this time are not permanent, but only a step towards setting a unified exchange rate for the franc.</p>
<h3 id="e40">British Government Determined to Take Necessary Measures: Finance Minister Reports to the House of Commons on the Paris Negotiations <a href="#e40" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c40" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">40</a></h3>
<p>[Report from Our Own Newspaper] London, 26th (Broadcast): Following his participation in a cabinet meeting today, British Chancellor of the Exchequer Cripps informed the House of Commons that Britain will take all necessary measures to maintain the stability of the pound sterling's value, so as not to be affected by the devaluation of the French franc.</p>
<p>[United Press London, 26th] The cabinet convened an emergency meeting today to discuss the threat to the value of the pound sterling following France's announcement of the devaluation of the franc. Chancellor of the Exchequer Cripps will present a report detailing the failure of his trip to France to dissuade the French government from abandoning its plan to devalue the franc.</p>
<p>[United Press London, 26th] Government bonds on the stock market suddenly plummeted today, causing widespread panic. The future of the pound sterling is difficult to assess, and most newspapers here believe the pound is on the verge of crisis.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse London, 25th] It is generally believed in London financial circles that the French government's decision on currency reform directly violates the Bretton Woods international monetary agreement. It is claimed that "the French government's action will set a dangerous precedent for other countries, sufficient to promote international monetary chaos. The French government may also be unable to control its domestic financial market. It remains highly doubtful whether allowing the French franc's exchange rate to float will cause funds stored abroad to flow back to the country. This method is likely to cause more illegal trading. Although gold still cannot be freely traded in the French free market, the value of the pound sterling against the US dollar will inevitably decrease due to the increase in illegal trading. French prices are already 40% higher than the world's average, but with the floating exchange rate, France can dump goods into the dollar area at low prices. At a time when Britain and France increasingly need to sign economic and political agreements, the French government's adoption of such measures is truly regrettable."</p>
<p>[Reuters London, 25th] According to Reuters' financial correspondent Campbell, the main reason for Britain's opposition is not the fear that exports will decrease due to the devaluation of the French franc, but the fear that the pound sterling will be hindered by the French free market. Britain and other countries are not afraid of their exports decreasing.</p>
<h3 id="e41">Anglo-French Joint Communiqué Issued <a href="#e41" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c41" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">41</a></h3>
<p>[Reuters London, 25th] The full text of the Anglo-French joint communiqué regarding the French franc issue is as follows: French Finance Minister Mayer exchanged views with the British Chancellor of the Exchequer in London on the 16th and 17th of this month regarding the French government's currency plan. Chancellor Cripps then traveled to Paris on the 23rd and 24th to continue these negotiations. Although the two governments' opinions on the methods to be adopted in this matter did not coincide, the talks in London and Paris have demonstrated the candor and close nature of the existing relations between the two countries. The French government has submitted its proposal to the International Monetary Fund in Washington, explaining that the measure it has chosen is the only way to cope with the current situation, and does not intend it to be a permanent monetary system, but rather a step towards establishing a stable currency system based on a single exchange rate, which is the goal of French fiscal and economic policy. The British side has also reported Chancellor Cripps' objections to the International Monetary Fund. The Fund issued a statement on this matter today, which the British and French governments have noted. The United Kingdom government has expressed a consistent stance on the Fund's statement. Although the British and French governments have different views on this matter, they are willing to continue to cooperate so that any measures required under the current circumstances will have only a minimum impact on business relations between the pound sterling and franc zones. The two governments agree on this point, and under this spirit of understanding, the two countries have decided that technical experts from both sides will immediately begin close cooperation.</p>
<h3 id="e42">Reactions Within France <a href="#e42" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c42" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">42</a></h3>
<p>[Reuters Paris, 25th] The general French public has mixed feelings about the devaluation of the French franc. Sensitive individuals deeply fear that domestic prices will be stimulated and rise as a result. Leaders of the Socialist Party, some Radical Party members, and prominent economists have great doubts about the effects of the new system. Some point out that the political consequences it will cause, such as the opposition of the British government, will outweigh its economic benefits. Official sources sincerely hope that the differences between Britain and France will not lead to a deterioration in relations between the two countries. It is expected that when Prime Minister Schuman addresses the National Assembly on Monday afternoon, he will make a strong statement on these matters.</p>

<p>[Associated Press Paris, 25th] With the impending devaluation of the French franc, French exporters are prepared to greatly reduce the prices of French-made wines, perfumes, and other goods, so their patrons will soon feel the impact of the devaluation.</p>

<p>[Associated Press Jerusalem, 25th] The civil war between the Jewish and Arab communities, which has been ongoing for eight weeks, has resulted in a death toll of 3,200 as of the evening of the 25th. In the meantime, Jews and Arabs have engaged in a major air battle over the opening of the Jerusalem-Tel Aviv highway, currently taking place on the Seven Sisters Hills.</p>
<h3 id="e45">International Monetary Fund Disapproves, But Will Still Cooperate with France to Revise This System <a href="#e45" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c45" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">45</a></h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse Washington, 25th] Managing Director Gutt of the International Monetary Fund issued a statement saying, "The International Monetary Fund cannot fully endorse the financial measures proposed by France, but will continue to cooperate with France in the future so that the country can ultimately change its decision. The Fund believes that France does indeed need to adjust the exchange rate of the French franc, and is prepared to cooperate with France to ensure that the exchange rate after the devaluation of the French franc is realistic. The Fund is very satisfied with the new steps taken by the French government last month in fiscal and budgetary matters to stabilize the domestic currency system. As for the issue of free exchange trading, the Fund has studied all possible alternative methods, but ultimately feels it difficult to endorse the French government's intention to allow foreign exchange earned from French goods exports to be sold in the free market.</p>
<p>This move will not only adversely affect the member countries of the Fund, but is also not necessary for the stability of the French economy. The Fund deeply fears that other countries will also compete to lower their own currency values as a result, causing trade to deviate from its normal course. The Fund is aware that the French situation is very serious, but believes that the solution lies in joint efforts to maintain the stability of currency values at a safe level. The Fund regrets that the French government has decided to implement its plan despite the Fund's opposition. The Fund will continue to cooperate with France to find an alternative to this foreign exchange system that meets France's needs within the scope of the International Monetary Agreement."</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse Washington, 25th] Managing Director Gutt of the International Monetary Fund declared today while hosting a group of news reporters that people should not be too agitated about the devaluation of the French franc. The Fund will not be taking retalitory action against France, and the results of the devaluation are difficult to predict. However, he added that it was gratifying that the French government had frankly informed them of all the steps they intended to take. Gutt acknowledged that a complex situation will be created if other countries do not understand their equal status in the French free trade market and therefore cancel trade agreements made with France. He admitted that the Fund's opposition to this matter was roughly the same as the opposition made by the United Kingdom, but refused to indicate whether this was due to the insistence of the United Kingdom. Gutt declared that France stated it will not apply to the Fund for assistance within the next year, and said that France will guarantee that this measure is only temporary.</p>

<p>[Associated Press Washington, 26th] France's implementation of the devaluation of the French franc, despite the opposition of the International Monetary Fund, does not appear to have affected the Marshall Plan or the assistance France receives under this plan today. However, it is generally believed here that France's move is an heavy blow to the Fund, which is still in its infancy, and it is feared that other countries will follow suit. The Fund was established to prevent economic warfare, so as to avoid armed warfare. US government officials declared today that the US government will continue its current aid to France plan, hoping that France and the Fund can resolve their differences on this matter.</p>
<p>[Reuters Washington, 25th] Authoritative sources revealed: The United States has expressed support for Britain's opposition to France's establishment of a free foreign exchange market. The United States also fears that France's system will not achieve the desired results domestically, and will worsen political relations in the coming months, eventually affecting the satisfactory development of Bevin's "Western European Union" plan, as well as the US Congress's review of the Marshall Plan for European aid. If Britain believes that France's system discriminates against trade with Britain, it may take retaliatory trade control measures against France. It is generally hoped that close talks between Britain and France can improve relations in Western Europe.</p>

<p>[Associated Press London, 25th] British sources have recently stated that Britain may convene a seven-nation conference in London to turn Foreign Secretary Bevin's Western European Union plan from words into reality. Bevin held lengthy talks with Italian Ambassador to Britain Gallarati on the 25th. It is understood that the two discussed the possibility of cooperation between Italy and Britain, France, Portugal, and the Benelux countries (Belgium, the Netherlands, and Luxembourg). It is expected that the next major step will be negotiations between Britain, the United States, and France on Germany.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse Rome, 25th] Italy will participate with the Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg in the conference to be held in Brussels on February 2 to establish a customs union. The Italian delegation will be led by Grazzi, Director of Economic Affairs at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse Paris, 25th] Regarding the economic alliance between Britain, France, and the Benelux countries, Agence France-Presse has learned from reliable sources that the British and French governments will begin talks soon to discuss the future relationship between the British and French overseas territories. Since Britain and France will each be a member of the Western European bloc, and in order to enhance their economic cooperation with each other, they must stipulate the relationship between the territories of the two countries. The discussion program includes the following key points: 1. Transportation and mutual use of ports; 2. Common price policy; 3. Joint production plans, so that the various members of the British and French overseas groups can complement each other's production; 4. Trade between the members. Preparatory talks will begin in February.</p>

<p>This Move is Tantamount to Challenging Taft</p>
<p>[Reuters Washington, 26th] Former Minnesota Governor Stassen told reporters yesterday that he will participate in the Republican primary in Ohio on May 4. As Ohio is the home state of Senator Taft, Stassen's move is tantamount to challenging Taft. Stassen said that his participation in the primary in Ohio is the only opportunity for the Republican Party to determine the relative strengths of Stassen and Taft based on election votes before the party convenes its convention in June to elect a presidential candidate. It is said that Stassen's decision was influenced by General Eisenhower's refusal to participate in the election campaign last Friday. This move also proves the inaccuracy of the claim that Stassen and Taft have a tacit understanding.</p>

<p>[Associated Press Madison, Wisconsin, 25th] Former Governor La Follette, who was the leader of the Progressive Party before its dissolution, and who served on the staff of General MacArthur during the war, broadcast on the 25th, launching the movement to elect MacArthur as President in Wisconsin. La Follette said that MacArthur is far superior to other candidates in promoting world peace and preventing American militarism. He said that MacArthur's excellent performance in governing Japan, breaking the Japanese monopoly, establishing personal freedom, encouraging cooperative purchasing, and reforming the land, all achieved great results. MacArthur is the only senior military officer who has not announced his support for peacetime conscription; if MacArthur is elected, no one can make the United States fight against the Soviet Union. La Follette directly responded to Eisenhower's argument, saying that it is inappropriate to oppose someone's presidency simply because they are a military officer.</p>

Rhee expressed his views at a meeting of the Second Subcommittee of the investigative team, saying that this government would represent two-thirds of the Korean people, and said that the provisional election method within three months would definitely complete the organization so that the investigative team and the people's representatives would have the opportunity to discuss.</p>

<p>[Reuters London, 26th] Negotiations on the possibility of revising the 1946 Anglo-Transjordanian Treaty, as well as on the future status of Transjordanian troops currently stationed in Palestine by Britain, are scheduled to begin at 2:30 PM on the 26th when the Prime Minister of Transjordan visits Foreign Secretary Bevin. Britain is eager to revise the 1946 Anglo-Transjordanian Treaty to align with Britain's recent Middle East policy, and the relinquishment of certain privileges seems inevitable. It is believed here that the future status of Transjordanian troops is a most delicate issue. Some of these troops have recently participated in Arab attacks on Jewish areas, and the Palestinian government has asked Britain to raise this matter during negotiations. However, if these troops are disbanded, it will create serious defense problems for Transjordan and will inevitably provoke opposition from the Transjordanian delegation. Although a compromise is ultimately expected, the manner in which it will be achieved is not generally predictable.</p>

<p>[Associated Press Tokyo, 26th] The Allied Forces' occupation report for December of last year states that the easing of the severity of the Japanese coal shortage and the passage of the six major reform bills by the Japanese Diet have greatly increased the hope of the Japanese people for economic recovery and continued progress. The six bills passed by the Diet are: 1. Abolition of the Ministry of Home Affairs; 2. Temporary state control of some coal mines; 3. Dissolution of "excessive power" in the economy; 4. Expansion of local political autonomy; 5. Establishment of a Prosecutor General to replace the Ministry of Justice.</p>
<p>[Associated Press Tokyo, 26th] MacArthur's headquarters announced today: The Allied Forces will be used as a backing to require Japanese people to pay taxes, as the inability to collect taxes has forced the government to print paper money, further worsening the already deteriorating inflation.

<p>[Central News Agency Manila, 26th, Combined Dispatch] The old Spanish-style city of Iloilo and its scenic vicinity suddenly experienced violent earthquakes beginning at 2:00 AM today, lasting for over an hour, destroying many buildings and shocking the residents in their sleep. This earthquake was the most violent in 50 years, but Manila only had slight tremors.</p>
<p>[San Yang News Agency Manila, 25th, Combined Dispatch] After 17 violent earthquakes occurred in the central Philippines today, Iloilo, its third largest city, suffered heavy damage, with at least 15 deaths and serious injuries each, and about 50 minor injuries. Due to incomplete equipment, the Philippine Meteorological Bureau was unable to determine the epicenter of the earthquake. It is said that the epicenter was obviously near Iloilo, and the city suffered the most damage.</p>
<p>[Associated Press Manila, 25th] Five islands in the central Philippines were struck by continuous earthquakes today. Panay Island suffered the most damage, estimated to be worth at least US$5.1 million. The other four islands are Negros, Cebu, Leyte, and Marinduque. The most casualties occurred in Iloilo, the capital of Panay Island, where one person was killed by falling bricks while praying in the Arellano Temple.</p>
<p>[Another dispatch] The Philippine Meteorological Bureau reported today: The earthquake in Iloilo City this afternoon affected five major islands within four hours. Many huge cracks formed in the ground, some hundreds of yards long, and seawater surged into the sky, reaching the height of coconut trees. Many historically significant churches, schools, and buildings in six cities collapsed. A Manila news reporter witnessed the situation and reported: "At 1:46 PM, as the reporter was holding a pen, Iloilo City was experiencing a two-minute earthquake. Residents were frantically running in the streets again. Men and women, struck by terror, rushed out of their homes with children in their arms, seeking safety in the fields. A woman leading her child cried out: "There's still more coming! Oh heavens, what's happening?!"</p>
<h3 id="e62">Hull's Memoirs Copyright by North American Newspaper Alliance Translated by This Newspaper's Editorial Department The White House Group Plays "Liberalism" Tricks <a href="#e62" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c62" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">62</a></h3>
<p>I often had the opportunity to see the President in the morning, when he was still in bed. Usually, he was already up, had breakfast, and then returned to bed to handle the first work of the day. I found his bed covered with newspapers, documents, letters, and telegrams. I would drag a chair nearby to sit down, and we would begin to discuss the issues at hand. This method was customary for me during my many years in the State Department.</p>
<p>Generally speaking, I was not a close friend of the President in social aspects. I was not invited to White House banquets (except for official formal banquets), or to take weekend trips on Mr. Roosevelt's yacht, or to go to Hyde Park. Roosevelt respected my decision that I was unwilling to distract my energy in social aspects, but wanted to preserve them to handle official business. In addition, I honestly did not like being invited to the groups in the White House, who often played "liberalism" tricks to the extreme.</p>
<p>Everyone knows that I am not an extreme liberal, nor a semi-radical, like some people close to the President. It was as awkward for me to be with them as it was for them.</p>
<p>What I found more meaningful was that I had many times when I dined alone with the President in a comfortable and quiet setting. In this situation, we could at least talk face to face for an hour without being verbose.</p>
<p>My relationship with the President's mother, Sara Delano Roosevelt, was the most sincere. In my opinion, she was an outstanding woman who had dedicated everything to her son and her country. I first knew her because I heard that she often supported me and my views on official business. She became a warm and familiar friend, and in our conversations, she always showed a broad knowledge and accurate understanding of international issues and the current situation.</p>
<p>Mrs. Roosevelt was a bit more to the left than I was, and my contact with her was extremely limited, although it has allowed me to appreciate her abilities. She was a brave fighter for peace, and she exerted a broad influence in the United States and other countries for peace and other humanitarian work.</p>
<p>I believe the President was completely honest with me; although I did not attend his purely military meetings - unless the issues discussed also involved diplomacy - or domestic affairs meetings, I never asked him a most confidential question about the military or domestic situation, unless he immediately and unreservedly told me all the details, I would stop there. We had several ambassadors, especially Bullitt, who was stationed in Moscow and then in Paris, Kennedy, who was stationed in London, and Davies, who was stationed in Moscow and then in Brussels, because they were all old friends of the President, and often wrote directly to the President, discussing important policy issues, bypassing me. It has always been inappropriate for ambassadors and ministers to communicate directly with the President, and I have argued with Roosevelt on this point. But despite this, I cannot recall any significant instances that prove that the State Department's views and policies have been significantly hampered by this behavior.</p>
<p>The President liked to use a method that was often very embarrassing for the State Department, which was to send special envoys abroad in the capacity of his personal representatives to talk to foreign government leaders or perform certain tasks. Among these special envoys were Hopkins, Wallace, Harriman, Hurley, Sheenovan, and Davies, who were all sent out once or twice. In many cases, sending these special envoys often caused confusion among our ambassadors and ministers stationed in those countries. However, their missions rarely interfered with the government's work strictly within the scope of diplomacy.</p>
<p>The President and I often discussed the appointment of my key assistants in the State Department and the ambassadors and ministers stationed abroad. As time went on, the President often made many suggestions for this type of appointment. But in most cases, it was always the State Department that made suggestions to him, and after proper procedures, he expressed his approval, with only a few exceptions.</p>
<p>His own suggestions to me were often concise, written in pencil or pen on small White House notepads, without a date, often like this:</p>
<p>"Smith to Chongqing</p>
<p>"Jones to Paris</p>
<p>"Brown recalled</p>
<p>"?"</p>
<p>After the capital of Turkey was moved from Istanbul to Ankara, I received a note from him written in pencil:</p>
<p>"C.H. (Cordell Hull abbreviation - translator)</p>
<p>"Why can't we move our embassy from Istanbul to Ankara?</p>
<p>"FDR"</p>
<p>(Franklin Delano Roosevelt abbreviation - translator)</p>
<p>I wrote underneath in red pencil. "Deeply agree.</p>
<p>"C.H."</p>
<p>Before Roosevelt became President, I always called him "Franklin." After that, I called him "Mr. President," because one reason was that he was often with others when I saw him. But even when it was just the two of us together, I called him "Mr. President," although we rarely used titles. He always called me "Cordell," before and after he became President.</p>
<p>The President only went to the State Department once. Before he came to the State Department, he spent several hours on the floor above finding offices for his "assistants whose names no one knew."</p>
<p>I suggested to the President more than once that he invite former President Hoover to discuss certain issues, such as the food situation abroad. I myself never hesitated to consult with my predecessor, Mr. Stimson, and I received valuable help from him, especially in the legislation of trade agreements. But the relationship between the President and Hoover had become very bad, and as a result, the former never invited the latter to the White House.</p>
<p>I myself had several informal discussions with Hoover, although not officially at the State Department. Following Hoover's suggestion, our talks were held at the home of former Undersecretary of State Castle (Wlliiam Castle), and I reported the content of the talks to the President. Hoover expressed the most enthusiastic interest in public affairs. As for whether his extreme animosity toward Roosevelt made his party's flavor more intense, I cannot say. In any case, it was a mutual animosity.</p>
<p>Some people with extreme left-wing colors often provoked the President's relationship with the State Department; it was not Mr. Roosevelt himself who made things difficult for the State Department, but a small number of people with left-wing colors who often protested to him because I did not accept their orders. He, except for occasionally complaining about the State Department "leaking news," never said to me that he "hated" the State Department, as one or two people later said. He knew that most of his speeches, statements, and letters on foreign policy were drafted by me and the officials of the State Department on their suggestion or at their request. He was satisfied with us doing so.</p>
<p>On December 31, 1943, about eleven years after I entered the State Department, he sent me a note that is worth quoting: "Here, I am sending you a memorandum that I sent to Churchill. (This memorandum was attached to a memorandum that I previously sent to the President regarding the relationship between the Free French Committee and Italy.) Thank God, I don't have the same difficulties with the State Department that he has with his Foreign Office - F.D.R."</p>
<p>Generally speaking, the President's cabinet played a very small role in the formulation of foreign policy. In cabinet meetings, I found that there was not as much discussion of foreign relations as I imagined.</p>
<p>Regarding important secrets, I often kept silent in the cabinet, because there had been cases of leaking such news to favored journalists and broadcasters. According to the most reliable information I have obtained, this leak was limited to a very small number of cabinet members.</p>
<p>Some cabinet members often encroached on the authority of another or other cabinet members. This situation made me feel very uncomfortable several times later; for example, this happened when discussing the embargo on Japan, and when Wallace's Economic Warfare Bureau tried to allocate the main tasks related to economic warfare to the State Department and other agencies.</p>
<p>Since it has been my consistent policy to separate diplomatic work from domestic affairs, and the President has specialized in domestic affairs and purely military work, it is natural that my personal relationship with the President is not as close as that of some cabinet members, because cabinet members who handle domestic affairs need to hold meetings with him frequently to discuss the problems that arise at any time and are almost countless. In this situation, it is also natural to create a so-called internal kitchen cabinet composed of several people. These people often wanted to interfere with the work of other ministries in the name of the President or others, seemingly without obtaining the President's instructions. It is puzzling that two or three cabinet members and some White House staff members have been attacking the policies of the State Department in the name of the President, while at this time the President and I were working harmoniously together. This is one of the several unpleasant experiences that our cabinet members must endure.</p>
<p>In these cabinet meetings, the President was lighthearted and interesting. His amiable personality was fully felt. He liked anecdotes and liked to tell them. He was almost always very happy, and he spoke in a relaxed and interesting way.</p>
<p>One day, he walked into a cabinet meeting with a smile on his face, a little late. He said that he had just suffered a slight impoliteness from a relative. This relative said to him: "Sir, you talk so much that we never have a chance to speak." The President laughed while telling this anecdote, and then turned to me and said, "Cordell, do you agree with this statement?"</p>
<p>I replied, "Oh, Mr. President, just before I came to the meeting today, some reporters met me and said to me:</p>
<p>"Mr. Secretary, it is rumored that the food at the White House is very bad lately. We want to know your opinion."</p>
<p>"I never eat anything at the White House," I replied.</p>
<p>"What!" they shouted. "We know you often go to the White House for lunch or dinner."</p>
<p>"That's indeed true," I said. "But before I go to the White House, I always eat lunch or dinner first. In this way, when the President is eating, I can have a chance to say a few words."</p>
<p>The President laughed with everyone.</p>

<p>[Reported by this newspaper] Under the direct impact of the Siberian cold current, the climate in this city was extremely cold yesterday, breaking this year's record and creating the lowest peak in the past five years. According to the record in 1943, the temperature was minus 10 degrees Celsius, and the coldest temperature recorded since 1944 was minus 7 degrees Celsius, while yesterday's lowest temperature dropped to minus 8.3 degrees Celsius. In the morning, water vapor on the glass windows condensed into ice, which did not melt for a long time. The harsh wind outdoors struck the face like a knife. Although the sun was shining, the power of the severe cold did not diminish at all. According to the weather station report, the Yellow Sea: cloudy and frozen, haze, northerly wind to uncertain wind, medium waves. Central China: dangerous to cloudy, frozen, local snow, light fog in the morning and evening, brisk northwest wind to northeast wind. Shanghai: overcast, haze, frost in the morning, brisk northwest wind to northeast wind, light fog in the morning and evening. East China Sea: cloudy to overcast, rain in the south, strong north wind to northeast wind, huge waves, turbulent sea waves around Taiwan. The center of the cold current has stagnated in Central China, so the severe cold will continue for several days, and there is hope for a warming trend starting on the weekend. The Pushan Villa collected as many as 78 children's corpses yesterday, most of whom died from freezing.</p>

<p>[Reported by this newspaper] In recent days, the climate in this city has been extremely cold, and citizens who have electric heating equipment have been using it for heating, resulting in a sharp increase in power consumption, which has greatly affected the power consumption of factories. It is reported that half of the yarn factories in this city were shut down yesterday due to insufficient power supply. According to statistics from the Shanghai Electric Power Company, at 9:00 a.m. on the 22nd of this month, the temperature in this city was 55 degrees Fahrenheit, and the company generated 148,000 kilowatts, without reducing the power consumption of yarn factories. At 9:00 a.m. yesterday, the temperature was 22 degrees Fahrenheit, and the power consumption was 150,000 kilowatts, an increase of 2,000 kilowatts compared to the 22nd. The reason for the sudden increase is probably due to the opening of electric heaters, so the power consumption of yarn factories had to be reduced by 11,000 kilowatts. It is found that the power consumption of yarn factories usually requires 180,000 kilowatts, so it can be seen that half of their power has been used by other parties.</p>
<p>In order to meet the needs of both households and factories, the power company must generate 169,000 kilowatts, but under the current circumstances, this is simply impossible.

<p>[Reported by this newspaper] The equipment of the Shanghai South Wharf in this city was completely destroyed by the enemy during the Anti-Japanese War. The Public Works Bureau organized the South City Wharf Restoration Committee to plan a full restoration and improve the equipment. The first phase of wharves 1 to 9 has been completed. It took 11 months and cost over 7 billion, and can berth eight 3,000-ton giant ships at the same time. The bureau invited city councilors and the press to visit at 2:00 p.m. yesterday. The visiting parts included three parts: 1. Wharf restoration project, 2. Truck river crossing ferry project, 3. Pudong Avenue construction project.</p>
<p>Those who attended yesterday included Zhao Zengjue, director of the Public Works Bureau, Zhang Rentao, deputy director, and Zhu Jiapeng, secretary, as well as Tang Shichang, Jiang Hao, Wang Zhuyi, Gao Xu'an, , Ma Shaoquan, Wang Shijie and Ye Dezeng of the Wharf Management Office, Zhang Huikang and Zhou Qixin of the Ferry Company, and Zhu Guoxi and Tang Mingshi of the Public Works Bureau. After gathering at the Municipal Ferry Terminal on the Bund of Beijing Road, they took special ferry No. 5 directly to Wharf No. 1 of Yangshupu to visit in order. According to Director Zhao's report on the wharf restoration project, before the war, the South City Wharf started from Dongmen Road in the north and went to Jia Du in the south. There were 21 floating wharves and 6 fixed wharves, all of which were destroyed during the war. After the restoration, the South City Wharf Restoration Committee decided on the principle that the location of each wharf should still be based on the pre-war one, and all floating wharves should be equipped. The original 18 floating wharves are planned to be completed in two phases. The first phase is to build wharves 1 to 9 first, and the second phase is to restore wharves 10 to 18. The first phase of the project is expected to allow 18 3,000-ton giant ships to berth at the same time, with an annual throughput of about 2 million tons, accounting for 15% of the total tonnage of ships in Shanghai Port every year. Construction started on November 20, 1946, and has now been fully completed. The second phase of the project needs to be continued urgently, but it suffers from insufficient financial resources and lack of materials, and the warehouses below Wharf No. 12 used by military agencies have not been fully returned and opened. There are many difficulties, and I hope that people from all walks of life will assist.</p>

<p>Regarding the sabotage by treacherous elements in the Zhenfeng and other woolen mills in this city, Social Affairs Bureau Director Kuai Xian specially made a statement on this matter yesterday: "Regarding the case of woolen mill workers in this city requesting year-end bonuses, due to the general conditions of the industry in this city in 1947 being worse than in previous years, after repeated mediation, an agreement was first established by the wool industry labor union and the trade association in the Third District, and then Chief Commissioner Lu of the Year-End Bonus Handling Committee personally mediated. The conditions were already very favorable, but a small number of treacherous elements in factories such as Zhenfeng, Yuanfeng, and Yin instigated trouble, making unreasonable demands that amounted to as much as five months, and instigating a starvation strike movement as a means of coercion, and occupying the factory day and night, surrounding factory directors and staff, and damaging raw materials and finished products. This kind of behavior is not only similar to hooliganism but is extremely illegal.

<h3 id="e88">Postal Bureau Underpayment Case: Plaintiff's Lawsuit Dismissed; Not an Unjust Enrichment Without a Legal Reason <a href="#e88" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c88" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">88</a></h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] Lawyer Cheng Mengming previously sued Li Jinlu, the director of the Shanghai Postal Administration Bureau, in the civil court of the district court, requesting the return of the underpayment for mail after the postal and telecommunications price increase. Judge Ling Yuanqing of the civil court ruled: "The plaintiff's lawsuit is dismissed, and the litigation costs shall be borne by the plaintiff."</p>
<p>The reasoning for the judgment is roughly as follows: "The postal and telecommunications price increase was passed by the 16th meeting of the State Council, and the Executive Yuan implemented it accordingly. Although the Legislative Yuan later suggested to the State Council to order the Executive Yuan to submit the postal and telecommunications price increase case to the Legislative Yuan for review, the National Government handed it over to the Legal System Review Committee for review. According to the committee's report, the State Council is the highest state organ of the National Government according to law and has the power to formulate legislative principles. Based on previous cases, the State Council has revised legal provisions by resolution and ordered their implementation first, and there are precedents. The committee believes that the National Government Committee should be considered to have the power to make expedient arrangements in accordance with Article 16 of the Organic Law of the National Government, since it is the highest state organ of the National Government, and the precedents are as described above. Therefore, the State Council should be considered to have the power to make expedient arrangements, and the resolution of its 16th meeting regarding the postal and telecommunications price increase case should be considered legal and valid. It also ordered the Executive Yuan to submit the postal and telecommunications price increase case to the Legislative Yuan to complete the legislative procedure, and informed the Executive and Legislative Yuan. The above facts are all published in newspapers and are obvious facts. Therefore, the defendant's order to the plaintiff to make up the postage of 1,500 yuan is not without legal reason, and does not constitute unjust enrichment. The plaintiff's request for return is not reasonable and should be dismissed in accordance with the provisions of Article 249, Paragraph 2 of the Civil Procedure Law without oral argument." Cheng disagreed with the judgment after it was handed down and sent a letter to all members of the Legislative Yuan yesterday, reporting the process.</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] Dalian Mayor Gong Xuesui is running around in Tianjin, Beijing and Shanghai to raise money for the refugees in Datong City who have been forced to flee their homes. In Beiping, he met female painter Guo Yun. Ms. Guo, who is eager to help others, selected more than forty oil paintings from her late husband Professor Yang Zigu's posthumous works and donated them to Mayor Gong. Mr. Gong brought them to Shanghai and scheduled to exhibit and sell them in the China National Products Company on Nanjing Road starting today. The proceeds will be donated to Dalian refugees. According to Gong's words, Dalian citizens have been subjected to various oppressions by the Soviet army and the illegal municipal government. The refugees have accounted for two-fifths of the city's population. More than 48,000 refugees have registered with the Dalian Municipal Government's office in Shenyang. Most of the refugees are from Shandong and are mostly living in Shenyang, Yingkou, Jinzhou, Tianjin, Beiping, Qingdao and other places, waiting to be fed and in urgent need of relief. At the same time, Shen Fuwen, a professor at the Sichuan Provincial College of Arts, is also exhibiting his Dunhuang pattern lacquerware. Mr. Shen has been engaged in lacquerware research for more than 20 years. The patterns of the Northern Wei, Sui, and Tang dynasties discovered in the Dunhuang stone chambers are applied to lacquerware. They are exquisite and antique and are truly rare works of art. Mr. Shen, considering that the patterns and colors of Fujian lacquerware are gradually lagging behind, buried himself in research and invented the natural lacquer toning method. Therefore, the color of Mr. Shen's lacquerware is bright, and the pattern can also be as desired, without being limited by the lacquer color. According to Professor Shen: Domestic lacquer has the characteristics of heat resistance and acid resistance, so lacquerware is not damaged by boiling water and strong acid. European and American people love it very much. If factories are built on a large scale in the future and exported to Europe and the United States, a large amount of foreign exchange will definitely be earned. Mr. Shen's works are exhibited in Shanghai for the first time. This exhibition has a total of more than 130 pieces, which are his products in the last five years, which are more advanced than his earlier products. The exhibition period is only six days and will end on February 1st.</p>

When the inspection was about to be completed at No. 31, Jiaobaigarden, "Jialin" used its keen sense of smell to take out eight taels of opium from an old bookcase. At the same time, "Minli" also crawled out of a pile of garbage in the corner of the house and handed over a hand grenade. The homeowner Wang Zhaoji was detained and taken to the bureau for investigation. Then, in Xu Liutao's house in Chenjiatou, the two dogs also found a rifle and 40 bullets.

<h3 id="e101">Democracy Tutorial, Lesson Three: Hangzhou Legislative Yuan Election – The Most Tense Three Days <a href="#e101" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c101" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">101</a></h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Hangzhou 25th Dispatch] In Hangzhou's Democracy Tutorial, the election of Legislative Yuan members is already in its third lesson. January 21st, 22nd, and 23rd, these three days, Hangzhou this metropolis, has already implemented a large classroom for democracy education. In the classroom, there should always be a bit of the environment. Thus, we see all kinds of campaign slogans pasted all over the streets and alleys, campaign leaflets and photos of candidates. Many slogans are printed, such as "Unanimously elect Mr. Chen Lifu, a pillar of the country, as a member of the Legislative Yuan." Huge banners request the election of Lu Jingshi, and Lu Jingshi's exquisitely printed leaflets are also distributed on both sides of the roads. At both ends of the Provincial Education Association building on Yingshi Street, there are two huge banners requesting the election of Dai Chuanxian as a Legislative Yuan member for the education sector. Wu Wangao, a candidate for the agricultural association's Legislative Yuan member, also posted many slogans and advertisements. Inside and outside the Municipal Business Association, various slogans are posted everywhere advocating the unanimous election of Chen Xunyou, Chen Bosheng, Cheng Cangbo, and Hu Jianzhong as Legislative Yuan members for the press. This classroom arrangement for democracy education can truly be described as a dazzling array.</p>
<p>Campaign Vehicles</p>
<p>Class has begun. On the morning of the 21st, many candidates' cars were racing on the roads, carrying voters, carload after carload, to the polling stations to cast their precious votes. Many of the candidates' helpers are doing their best to collect scattered votes in an attempt to increase the number of votes for their candidates.</p>
<p>At the Agricultural Association's polling station, many farmers did come to vote. They all came from the fields, preparing to elect people who would speak for them. The Agricultural Association's votes were almost all concentrated on Wu Wangji. Wu had put in a lot of effort before the election, and he had also published many articles in the Zheng Bao newspaper.</p>
<p>The votes of the Chamber of Commerce were almost all cast. An employee specifically took a notebook to various trade associations to sign, proving how many votes had been collected.</p>
<p>Freedom of Occupation is Too Free</p>
<p>The freedom of occupation is really free enough. More than thirty votes of accountants were all abstained. In three days, not a single person came to vote. It is said that the reason why accountants abstained from voting was to express "protest." As for the reason for the "protest," one said it was because the candidates did not come to greet them, and another said it was because of another kind of relationship. Of the 554 votes of traditional Chinese medicine practitioners, only four were cast in three days, which is better than the accountants' total abstention, but the reason why they were not so enthusiastic is worth studying.</p>
<p>Films Comfort Voters</p>
<p>The Education Association still uses the old method of the National Assembly election, using film screenings to call on members to vote, and also using film screenings to comfort the voters. Because the Education Association's auditorium is rented out to people as a movie theater, it is conveniently located.</p>
<p>The candidates for the regional Legislative Yuan are also very innovative. Some surround the district chiefs of each district, some offer rewards to the heads of Baojia, some win over relatives and friends, and lobby in various neighborhoods. Some use students to persuade door-to-door, and various methods abound. It's truly "each has their own different skills"!</p>
<p>The workers of the union collectively went to the polling stations to vote. The postal workers' union was the most impressive. Carload after carload of green postal trucks, packed full of people in green uniforms, went to the union to vote.</p>
<p>Newspaper Reporters are Energetic</p>
<p>The most intense and enthusiastic was the Legislative Yuan election for newspaper reporters. Everyone attached great importance to this election for Legislative Yuan members of newspaper reporters, so the process was relatively more intense. It can be said to be the most exciting program in the third lesson of democracy. On the first morning, many people went to vote. The people managing the voting were very strict, saying that only the person themselves could vote. Later, they were afraid that this would not work, so they changed it to allowing voting with proof. So, people voted one after another. The result on the first day was that Chen Xunyou took the first place. By the second day, it became even more intense. More people were canvassing for votes everywhere. Many votes scattered in various corners were collected. In the polling station, you monitored me, and I monitored you. As soon as there was news, it was immediately transmitted to the "command post" of the campaign activities.</p>
<p>The third day was even more tense. The representatives of each candidate began negotiations. From negotiations, they proceeded to campaigning. Bustling, noisy, arguing endlessly.</p>
<p>The ballot box for newspaper reporters was set up inside a ballot box for free professional groups. Compared with the election of other free professional groups and the election of the newspaper reporter group, the degree of excitement was really worlds apart. They all watched the enthusiasm and tension of the newspaper reporters with their hands in their sleeves, and couldn't help but sigh: "Newspaper reporters are really energetic!"</p>
<p>The Last Moment</p>
<p>In the last moment of the election, Chen Xunyou and Hu Jianzhong's votes were still leading. Later, Hu Jianzhong's votes increased by more than ten votes, and Chen Xunyou's votes also increased by more than ten votes. Chen Bosheng also had many votes, and Cheng Cangbo also had votes. This finally brought the tense scene of the election to an end.</p>
<p>The bell for the end of the third lesson has already rung. Those who scored the most this time don't need to be proud, and those who scored the least don't need to be discouraged. When the next class starts, let's have another competition! (Special Correspondent Chu Yusheng)</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper Jiangyin 25th Dispatch] The Fourth 30309 bus of the Zhongyun Company, operating on the Chengwu Road, departed from Cheng to Wujin at around 8:00 AM on the 24th. Because Huo Qigui, a court police officer from the local court, was delivering a summons to Shen Gang for the case of Shi Shaogong embezzling workers' wages, he was in plain clothes on the bus and did not purchase a ticket. When station master Yang Xuefeng checked tickets, he requested a supplementary ticket, stating that even government employees must purchase half-price tickets. Officer Huo refused, leading to a conflict. Station Master Yang's face was injured. Later, after the persuasion of the military police inspection office, Station Master Yang and the court police went to the police station together, and together with Director Zhang met with Chief Prosecutor Li Shudong of the court, detailing the facts. It was very satisfactory. When Station Master Yang was about to leave the court gate, he was suddenly stopped by court police chief Qin Xuezeng and others, who sounded the police siren and did not allow Station Master Yang to leave, saying that the court must open immediately, and was interrogated by prosecutor Zhang Sen. Officer Huo claimed: The official summons was torn up by the station master, denying the assault. However, during the examination, the station master's facial injuries were confirmed. Both sides held their own positions, and were ordered to be detained. At around 10:00 AM, the court police escorted the station master to the prison, wanting to add shackles. For the sake of his face, the station master jumped into the river along the Hongqiao River in an attempt to commit suicide, but was restrained by the court police. In the afternoon, the Wujin General Company received the news and sent Shen Yuenian, the director of external inspectors, to Cheng to investigate. Station Master Yang was bailed out by lawyer Pan Bingying for medical treatment. The company, considering that transportation personnel were assaulted, specially submitted a report to the Provincial Highway Bureau to set up an Jiang defense headquarters, and filed a lawsuit with the District Prosecutor's Office according to law, and requested a transfer of jurisdiction for the investigation to ensure justice.</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper Haining 23rd Dispatch] In Xinsiqiao area of Dongshi Town, Dingqiao County, the wife of Shen Baoyuan is inherently unreasonable and often quarrels with neighbors.

<h3 id="e108">The Lock of Taiwan <a href="#e108" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c108" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">108</a></h3>
<p>— Penghu</p>
<p>One calm evening, a reporter took the Hengchun Wheel of the Taiwan Airlines Company and crossed the 78 nautical miles of the Taiwan Strait from Kaohsiung. As the sun rose and the rays of the sun shone, we stepped on the "lock of Taiwan," Penghu, whose English name was forgotten at the Cairo Conference.</p>
<p>Fishermen and their descendants filled the pier, each with a withered, black, and emaciated face. The sea breeze blew, and the isolated island had no trees with tall vortex roofs, and their eyes were blown red, swollen, and shy.</p>
<p>Grain Shortage Eight Months, Every Grain of Rice is Precious</p>
<p>The Penghu Islands are a collective name for 63 small islands in the Taiwan Strait, including 20 inhabited islands and 43 uninhabited islands. The total area is only over 126 square kilometers, but it is inhabited by more than 70,000 people, which is very dense. However, there is a strong sea breeze containing salt, no rain, no rivers, and no tall trees. Although it is an average of only 17 meters, the highest is only 60 meters of low platform land, but you can't see a paddy field. Crops are only sorghum, peanuts, and sugarcane, which are more suitable on the fourth-century alluvial basalt geology. Most people eat sugarcane, and some even scavenge seaweed to fill their hunger. However, even in a good year, the yield of sugarcane and other crops is only enough for the consumption of the entire island for four months. There is a grain shortage for eight months. Assuming that a person consumes at least 15 catties of rice per month, it would require 9 million catties. There is no storage here, and there is a lack of transportation. Relying on Taiwan Island, distant water often cannot put out a nearby fire. Rice is like pearls here. Although coral is abundant here, coral is not as good as rice. Coral is produced in the deep sea. The technology and equipment of the past, the Japanese did not leave behind. Now, three small shops are selling inventory. After a few years, the coral island will not be able to see coral.</p>
<p>When the Northeast Monsoon Rises, Cut Off from the World</p>
<p>On the 500-ton Hengchun Wheel, a section chief of the Penghu County Government told reporters: You shouldn't have come on a big ship. At first, I didn't understand what he meant. Then he explained that it is rare to have a big ship to Penghu once or twice a year. Penghu people mostly travel by small steamboats of 30 to 40 tons. The wind is strong and the waves are high. This precarious feeling cannot be appreciated by those who have not experienced it. At present, there are only a few public-operated ships, such as "Taijiao 117," and private ships, such as Qiansui, Zhenxing, Gaoxiang, and Haifei, that maintain sea transportation. From October to March each year, these ships cannot fight against the seasonal winds. If they take risks, they will go wrong in nineteen cases. The ships capsize, and people are eaten by fish instead. As a result, traffic is cut off and isolated. Who can hear them calling? All that is heard are tsunamis, which also carry salt rain to attack these isolated and helpless people. The common people are very simple. Taking Magong Town, the most lively town with 26,000 people, as an example, it is rare to have a criminal case in a month. There was no disturbance in 2.28 here. Of course, newspapers cannot be seen for months, and radios cannot be afforded. But they mostly have a character that is indifferent to the world. They just want to find hope and find life in the waves!</p>
<p>The Penghu Transportation Company operates 33 kilometers of highway business. There are few passengers and goods, and there is a shortage of gasoline. If the parts are broken, there is no way to replenish them. Land transportation has also stopped. The person in charge repeatedly pleaded with the provincial government to release the approved subsidy of 150,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Fishermen Struggling on the Hunger Line</p>
<p>Penghu is surrounded by the sea on all sides, and cold and warm currents converge. The fishing industry is the most developed. In the past, more than half of Penghu's people used the sea as their fields and engaged in fishing. During the Japanese rule, the fishing industry was so developed that there were more than 2,000 fishing boats. Last year's statistics were like this, and the actual number would exceed three times. If further improvements are made, it can reach ten times. After the war, most of the ships were destroyed, and the fishing ports, oil storage, sugar, and shipbuilding yards were all selected for destruction. The most important ice-making plant has been out of operation. Without ice, there is no fishing industry. People in Taiwan Island prepared ice ships and seized them at low prices. There is no strength to revitalize the fishing industry, because the whole problem cannot be solved. Transportation, food, and fishing are mutually causal, which is the crux of Penghu's suffering today. Chairman Wei once announced to the people of Penghu: After the windy season passes, he will definitely allocate regular flights to Taiwan and Penghu. He also guaranteed to provide the people of Penghu with enough water—the golden fish filled the sea, and I hope that "fishermen are poor from generation to generation" is really a song, not a prophecy.</p>
<p>Frontier Officials Arrive Twice</p>
<p>Xu Shengping, the county magistrate who educates the people of Penghu with "when the house catches fire, the first thing to grab is the portrait of the Prime Minister," uses naval officer positions to comprehensively manage county affairs. He is young and capable, and the summer camp is well-organized, but there are many occasions where his energy is so full that he goes a bit too far, but it is no wonder that the frontier officials who have come to Penghu for two hundred years, Zheng Chenggong, are Wei Chairman!</p>
<p>There are 21 national schools, 3 county-run middle schools, 1 provincial middle school, and 1 provincial vocational school of aquatic products, with a total of more than 8,100 students. Teachers suffer, and students suffer as well. They expect the revitalization of the fishing industry to live a better life.</p>
<p>Penghu is the key to the southeast, and Magong is the machine in the lock. The color of the naval port is very strong. Weeds grow on the fortress, and several old cannons squat quietly. Under the rapid development of war tools at the present stage, these cannons have lost their effectiveness to some extent. The reporter climbed to the top of the platform and looked out at the white waves. Here, one can still point out the landing places where French, Dutch, and Japanese conquerors attacked Penghu in the past. Magong Town still has the monument to the French Cuban Lieutenant General and the Thousand-Person Tomb of the Japanese Mixed Brigade in the Sino-Japanese War, which tells us that the people of Penghu have not lived a good day in the past two centuries. When the reporter left this small island that looked like barren land, thousands of people shouted on the shore, and two small boats sent them out of the port, waving hats and scarves, reluctantly saying goodbye, almost making me shed tears!</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper Wujin 25th Dispatch] The Laoshiye Silver Shop on Beida Street in the county was opened by Wang Bojin and others from Suzhou.

<h3 id="e113">Amidst the Flood of Overseas Remittances, the Minnan Overseas Compatriots Bear the Brunt <a href="#e113" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c113" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">113</a></h3>
<p>[Report from our Fuzhou correspondent, dated the 24th] Jinjiang, Nan'an, Tong'an, and Hai cheng Counties in Fujian Province are considered hometowns of overseas Chinese. This corner, from a political, economic, cultural, and even military perspective, seems like an insignificant place. However, it is probably the most extravagant, luxurious, and decadent area in the country.</p>
<p>This reporter often meets with people from the overseas Chinese hometowns of southern Fujian. In their conversations, they are all filled with endless emotion regarding the current social situation in their hometowns.</p>
<p>After the victory, the once-severed overseas remittances flowed back into the hometowns of overseas Chinese, re-draping the entire area in a vibrant and beautiful brocade. Overseas remittances are undoubtedly a huge source of income for the motherland and the local areas, and they are also a sweet rain for the families of overseas Chinese. However, because overseas remittances have not been properly channeled, some negative effects have spread and fermented widely in the overseas Chinese hometowns, creating various social ills.</p>
<p>Overseas Capital Stimulates Prices</p>
<p>The high prices in the counties of southern Fujian cannot be said to be unrelated to the gifts of overseas capital. Returning overseas Chinese bring large quantities of gold and foreign currency to purchase property, shop, and even gamble and patronize prostitutes. Gold has become a complete currency, and prices are rising step by step with the large circulation of gold and foreign currency. The fish and meat markets in Jinjiang are more expensive than those in Xiamen (Xiamen is more expensive than Fuzhou, and Fuzhou is more expensive than Nanjing). The families of overseas Chinese use the black market rate of foreign exchange as their standard when entering and exiting the markets. Although the amount of legal tender is enormous, it is not much when converted into foreign currency. High prices are irrelevant to the families of overseas Chinese, but pity the local civil servants and farmers.</p>
<p>Young Girls Eager to Marry "Foreign Guests"</p>
<p>Because of the soaring prices, the phenomenon of wealth disparity is particularly evident. Returning overseas Chinese have money, so they have become the ideal marriage partner for young girls. The betrothal gifts for returning overseas Chinese to marry a wife are no less than ten or twenty million yuan, and the fashionable decorations prepared for them often cost hundreds of millions of yuan. Poor women in the area admire and yearn for these wealthy "foreign guests" even more fervently than medieval Spanish women admired the triumphant knights. Most women worship money, which is not surprising.</p>
<p>Overseas Chinese Wives Compete in Beauty</p>
<p>Women are the strongest link in the consumer lifestyle. Overseas Chinese wives rely on their strong economic power to enjoy life to the fullest and spend lavishly. They compete in fashion, with "American-style" outfits from head to toe, often creating extremely disharmonious appearances that make people laugh. They even decorate themselves with more than half a pound of gold jewelry to show off to others. Overseas Chinese wives have nothing to do, so they use offering sacrifices to the gods and performing operas as entertainment, spending tens of thousands of gold without the slightest stinginess. In the countryside of Jinjiang (Jinjiang is the largest hometown of overseas Chinese), Western clothing stores, beauty salons, photo studios, flower novelty shops, and silk shops are springing up like mushrooms after rain, creating an atmosphere akin to a Chinese "Hollywood."</p>
<p>Money Creates Evil</p>
<p>In the overseas Chinese hometowns, US dollars have become the destination sought by all kinds of people. US dollars encompass the entire value and meaning of life. Gambling, feuding, robbery, and prostitution are all products of the overflow of money. Wealthy and rich returning overseas Chinese often act as patrons of the human flesh market. In the "salty meat shops" in the countryside of southern Fujian, a night of romance costs ten US dollars. Under the demand of romantic overseas guests, private prostitutes are increasing day by day. Because there is not enough entertainment to amuse overseas guests, gambling has become a substitute. With the prevalence of wealth, villains easily infiltrate, so public security has also become a problem. The overseas Chinese are most worried about the atmosphere of robbery in their hometowns.</p>
<p>High Interest Exploitation of Poor Farmers</p>
<p>Large overseas capital, because it has not been guided to proper channels, has deepened the crisis in rural areas. When farmers are running out of food, they often use the emergency measure of borrowing high-interest loans from overseas Chinese to survive. The "floating goods" system prevails in the overseas Chinese hometowns. Two or three months before the harvest, one dan of unhusked rice is sold for only 60,000 to 70,000 yuan, and one dan of peanuts is sold for 80,000 yuan. Farmers first receive the payment for the "floating goods" to buy fertilizer, but when the harvest comes, eight or nine out of ten times, it all belongs to the creditors. Overseas Chinese merchants buy and hoard at this time, manipulating the prices of local products, so the prices of products are high, and the farmers are in unspeakable distress.</p>
<p>How to Use Overseas Remittances</p>
<p>Overseas Chinese families carrying huge sums of overseas remittances do not want to invest in enterprises, but there are no suitable opportunities and conditions. It is said that in the overseas Chinese hometowns of southern Fujian, local tyrants and gentry often clamor to organize enterprise companies, using fraudulent methods to swindle overseas Chinese capital, thereby losing the overseas Chinese's confidence in people in the country. If the government can set up a number of small factories in southern Fujian and grant various guarantees of rights, it can guide a portion of overseas remittances to the path of production. In today's domestic lack of industrial capital, overseas remittances are a very usable force. (Special correspondent Chen Zhengyu)</p>

<p>[Report from our Yao correspondent, dated the 24th] The former Wang Bamei's subordinates, reorganized from the Pinghu Self-Defense Force, recently suddenly mutinied and became bandits, harassing merchant ships at sea. A few days ago, they landed in the Shiliuhu area on the border between Shangyu and Yuyao and hid along the coast during the day. In the evening, they contacted bandits in Nanshan. It is rumored that the bandits have a steel cannon and have fled into the Siming Mountain area. The First Brigade of the Zhejiang Security Force was ordered to enter Siming Mountain to suppress the bandits and has been sending teams to search Yinzhou West, Ci South Island, Danshan, and other places for days. The bandits' attempt to "collect ten catties of grain per mu" from the villages in Yuxi has been completely thwarted. It is also reported that more than 200 bandits led by Chen Buyi, carrying four light machine guns and complete rifles, are causing trouble in the Dalanshan area of southern Yao. The First and Second Battalions of the Zhejiang Security Force have been dispatched to search Mupingshan, Mahuang, Shiba Jiganxia, Guanting, Shanglianggang, Dongxiang, Lantian, Zhiling, and other areas and are advancing into Dalanshan.</p>

<p>[Report from our correspondent] The student strike at Tongji University has lasted for more than ten days. Judging from the current situation of the school and students yesterday, it is difficult to break this stalemate in the short term. Minister Zhu Jiaju, who flew to Shanghai from Taiwan the day before yesterday, convened a meeting with President Ding Wen-yuan of the school and the heads of various departments at the Academia Sinica yesterday afternoon and gave some instructions. On the student side, a meeting of department representatives was convened at the College of Engineering yesterday afternoon to review the preparations for the petition to Nanjing. They were in high spirits and decided to strengthen the organization and appoint responsible persons for various departments. They dispersed late at night. After dinner, the responsible persons held another meeting late into the night to discuss the technical issues of the petition to Nanjing. The representatives sent by the students to Nanjing to contact accommodation have returned to Shanghai yesterday and said that they have reached an agreement with various schools in Nanjing to arrange accommodation. Also, students of the school sent representatives to visit Minister Zhu yesterday, but did not meet him. They are scheduled to visit him again today to ask Mr. Zhu to come forward to mediate the student unrest in the capacity of an alumnus.</p>

<h3 id="e124">Ethnic Cultural Beauty, Turning Violence into Auspiciousness, Li Ximou Wrote the Preface to the Fine Arts Annual, Praising Shanghai as the Cradle of Emerging Art <a href="#e124" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c124" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">124</a></h3>
<p>[Report from our correspondent] The Municipal Art Tea Party has recently compiled the "Shanghai Municipal Fine Arts Yearbook." The preface was written by Li Ximou, Director of the Education Bureau. The original preface is as follows:</p>
<p>"Fine arts are the beautiful scenery of ethnic culture and the crystallization of the vitality of life. In terms of their function, they can reveal the trends of the people's living mood and the rise and fall of the entire culture. Looking at the beginning of the European Renaissance, it was the artists who pioneered it. The prosperity of Chinese artifacts in the Han and Tang Dynasties was also led by fine arts and religion. On a smaller scale, they can cultivate character and turn violence into auspiciousness. Can their impact on social customs be ignored?</p>
<p>Shanghai has convenient transportation, and modern humanities are gathered here. All cultural education, science, politics, and economics are at the forefront of the trend and hold a leading position. Even in terms of fine arts, its evolution of genres, development of theories, and influence extend to the entire world art scene, making it the cradle of emerging art in our country. Artists from all over the world who come to Shanghai with their art can receive fame and fixed prices. The situation is similar to Rome in Italy and Paris in France.</p>
<p>However, Shanghai is a vast city with a dense population. In order to facilitate the discussion of artistic theory, exchange of opinions, and connection of emotions among people in the art world, there are organizations of various fine arts groups. The most prominent ones are the Chinese Painting Society, the Shanghai Fine Arts Association, the Shanghai Painters Association, and the Fine Arts Tea Party. They have made many contributions to the exhibition of fine arts, the research of fine arts academics, assisting the government in promoting fine arts education, and assisting social relief undertakings.</p>
<p>Although Shanghai's position is so important, the contribution of people in the art world to the government and society is also great, and the development of the fine arts industry is also rapid, the relationship between the evolution of history and the relationship between social culture is very close. If there is no systematic record of the whole, it will not only disappear without a trace after a long time, but it will also be impossible for people at home and abroad to understand the current trends in the Shanghai art world. The gentlemen of the Municipal Art Tea Party have realized this, and therefore have taken the initiative to compile the Fine Arts Yearbook. The far-reaching significance is self-evident, and it can be predicted that it will contribute to fine arts education and national literature.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the value of fine arts in education and the importance of their relationship with social customs are as described above. The Education Bureau is aware of this and has planned to establish an art museum. However, due to the financial constraints of the municipal government, its formal establishment is still pending. The Art Museum Preparatory Office has held a centenary painting exhibition and will soon hold a Qing Dynasty painting exhibition. I am very grateful for the enthusiastic support of people in the art world in the city. I hope that people in the art world will continue to assist and urge them to complete the art museum as soon as possible. It is not only the fortune of our country's culture and education, but also the heartfelt prayer of all citizens of Shanghai. This is the preface."</p>

<p>The Export Control Commission, under the leadership of Director Huo Shishu, attaches great importance to promoting the export of commodities. The relevant departments of the commission have begun drafting this year's plan. It is reported that the plan includes two parts: (1) Increasing production; (2) Promoting sales. The production department has specific measures for production, transportation, loans, and other aspects. In terms of production, the emphasis is on improving quality, increasing output, and standardizing export commodities. In terms of transportation, the focus is on how to increase transportation efficiency, secure export time, and reduce transportation costs. For inland rivers and hinterland areas, the Ministry of Transportation will be responsible for establishing joint ventures, designating vehicles and ships to be specifically responsible for this task. In terms of loans, low-interest funding will be provided to exporters to enable them to make full use of the funds and reduce export costs. The sales promotion department also has specific decisions on issues related to promotion technology and exchange rates. For example, how to improve promotion technology and how to contact our commercial counselors stationed in various countries are all necessary. The policy of maintaining existing exchange rates will remain the main focus. In addition, a purchasing method is also established to purchase commodities that merchants cannot export. After the plan is formulated, it will be sent to the National Economic Commission for review and then reported to the Executive Yuan for approval. The person in charge of the commission stated that, under any difficult circumstances, they are determined to make the utmost effort to export commodities to increase foreign exchange reserves and balance international payments.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the North and South markets received a total of over 13,100 shi of rice. With the cold weather turning clear, the market showed gains in the morning but retreated in the afternoon. In the end, glutinous and indica rice showed little gain or loss, and white yuan saw little fluctuation. Flour mills were selling off, with a total of over 10,000 bags of various brands of flour. Prices remained the same, but old flour from military ships was in high demand, stepping over 10,000 yuan. Wheat bran trading was sluggish and flat.</p>
<p>Soybean cake demand was weak, falling by 3,000 to 5,000 yuan. Yellow soybean turnover was sluggish, with customer beans falling by 10,000 to 20,000 yuan, while Duhuanggou remained firm. Tea beans were actively traded in the north, with the market showing strength, rising slightly by 10,000 to 20,000 yuan. Broad beans were also selling well, with demand exceeding supply, causing prices to rise by 30,000 to 40,000 yuan. Rainbow beans were firm, and red beans rose again by 20,000 to 30,000 yuan.

<p>Tea Prices Soar</p>
<p>Although trading in the tea market among foreign firms remained sluggish, local traders and merchants from other provinces continued to purchase, with strong buying interest. They were taking goods as soon as they saw them. As a result, sellers felt that goods were scarce and held out for higher prices, triggering a sharp rise in prices. At the close of the market, each dan rose by tens of thousands to nearly one million yuan.</p>
<p>Green Sugar Rebounds</p>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market was stable, with red and white sugar showing minor fluctuations. However, green sugar rebounded by 40,000 to 50,000 yuan due to excessive declines in recent days and gradual sales. Shantou Green was 1.43 million to 1.44 million yuan, compared to 1.39 million to 1.37 million yuan in the previous session.

Previously, due to market volatility and rising stock prices, the Securities Exchange was instructed to raise the minimum capital amount, taking into account the existing capital of the brokers and the market situation, in order to protect market security and client interests. Brokers whose capital was insufficient to meet the new limit were ordered to increase it. Now, to facilitate the uniform handling of matters by brokers, the capital of each broker should be at least 500 million national currency. Furthermore, the Securities Exchange Brokerage Guarantee Fund was originally 50 million yuan. In addition to the cash and US dollar bonds already paid, brokers should increase it by 150 million national currency, for a total of 200 million yuan. Regarding the increase in the guarantee fund, it should be announced upon receipt of the document and completed within one month.

National Bond C opened at 72,000, retreated from 73,000 to 67,000, and finally remained near the opening price. Compared to last Saturday, Bonds A and B fell by 1,000 yuan, Bond C fell by 3,000 yuan, and Bonds D and E remained flat.</p>
<p>Foreign stocks rose initially and then declined yesterday. Securities firms and retail investors were selling. Ewo Silk fell from 645,000 and struggled around 580,000. Hong Kong Stocks also rose initially and then retreated to flat. The situation was volatile and trending downward.</p>
<p>At the morning opening, all stocks were stable except for the Telegraph Company, which did not show any improvement. Wing On opened at 770 yuan and 787 yuan, and there was still a rebound after the opening, retreating to 763 yuan and 784 yuan. At this time, the price shouted outside the market exceeded the delivered price by more than 10 yuan, and it rose to 790 yuan and 812 yuan. Later, as the telephone investigation outside the market intensified, it fell to 780 yuan and 7999 yuan. Guangdong merchants advanced by more than 10 yuan. The erroneous rumor that the off-market interest rate was 3.6 and 4.05 cents caused morale to plummet. Halfway through the session, the off-market interest rate was announced, although it was 3.3 cents and 3.75 cents, it was still considered too high, and buyers dispersed, gradually moving downstream. The off-market gradually leveled with the delivered price. Around noon, it rebounded slightly to a low price of 745 yuan and 770 yuan. The afternoon close rose to 758 yuan and 778 yuan. As a result, compared to the delivered stocks from last Saturday, Xinhua, Lihua, Lianzhong, and French each fell by 3 yuan, and there was little effect in maintaining the Western merchants' shares. Compared to last Saturday, paper shares fell by 10%, Ewo Silk, British Union, Jardine Matheson, Ewo Brewery, and Shipping all fell by 5%, Steel declined sharply, and the real estate market was flat.</p>
<h3 id="e141">China Trust Allocates Artificial Silk, Allocation Price Lower Than Last Week <a href="#e141" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c141" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">141</a></h3>
<p>The Central Trust Bureau allocated artificial silk to the ribbon and silk weaving industries for the fourth time yesterday (the 26th), allocating a total of 250 boxes of artificial silk. Allocation was similar to 73.6 million yuan for A-grade Dongyang and 73 million yuan for A-grade Tianqiao, which was about 2.5 million yuan lower than the allocation price last week.</p>
<h3 id="e142">Winter Goods, Woolens Stagnant <a href="#e142" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c142" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">142</a></h3>
<p>Recently, in addition to long-haired velvet, Mair Deng, and military ship overcoat woolens, various grades of plain, thick overcoat woolens that are in demand for the cold season show a phenomenon of being produced but not selling. Local merchants lack embellishments. The standard market price has therefore fallen from its peak. It is because the selling season has passed seven or eight tenths. Therefore, the thick woolens that should be sold in the current season are not as strong in sales as the thin spring and summer woolens that have not yet been sold. Yesterday, white canvas was quoted at 95,000 yuan per yard, Soviet rubberized cloth at 75,000 yuan, rainproof cloth at 110,000 yuan, and mercerized feathers were generally sold at 72,500 yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e143">Fangjian's Cotton Yarn Price Increases, 20-Count Yarn Listed at 34.75 Million Yuan <a href="#e143" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c143" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">143</a></h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's News] China Fangjian Company sold yarn as usual yesterday, selling a total of 895 pieces, equivalent to 1352.5 pieces of 20-count yarn. There were 328 purchase orders. The selling price of 20-count yarn has reached the negotiated price limit of January 16th of this year, listing at 34.75 million yuan per piece.</p>
<p>Yarn Prices Fluctuate</p>
<p>Yesterday, the cotton yarn market saw Fangjian Company's sales opening with a slight increase in the negotiated price, and the battle between buyers and sellers was fierce. Demand from northern merchants increased, and traders with loose money were strongly bidding up prices. The 42-count Phoenix fine yarn opened at the 60 million mark and quickly broke through it, shouting as high as 60.7 million. Later, with the hope of US loans, the stock market reported small losses across the board, and morale suddenly turned soft. Local sales were stagnant, and weaving mills' appetite was flat, causing the market to move downstream. There were also profit-taking sales. As a result, the 42-count Blue Phoenix fine yarn rose by 100,000 yuan compared to the weekend, to 59.8 million yuan. The prices of other coarse and fine yarns fluctuated by 200,000 to 300,000 yuan to 400,000 to 500,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Cloth Imports and Exports Scarce</p>
<p>Yesterday's cotton market saw increased inventory due to Fangjian's large supply on Saturday. Factories rarely imported or exported due to partial cash settlements. Due to transportation and cash constraints, Tianjin merchants often cut prices for sales. Hankou merchants were slow to absorb due to telegram delays. Cloth merchants and retail investors were constantly selling off due to economic pressures. As a result, 12-pound fine cloths fell by 5,000 to 23,500 yuan compared to the weekend, while twill and straight fine twill were more attractive. Other cloths showed little fluctuation.</p>
<p>Spot Cotton Market Continues to Be Firm</p>
<p>Yesterday, the spot cotton market was active. Traders felt optimistic because cotton yarn prices were trending higher. Yarn mills opened their appetites, and traders were strongly hedging. Market prices soared, and base prices were firm. 750 bales were traded. The factory price for Tuolisi was 5.787 million yuan, Han fine was 5.307 million yuan, the warehouse price for Han fine was 5.208 million yuan, and Tuolisi was 5.87 million yuan. Zhoupu seed cotton inferior goods were 1.15 million yuan.</p>
<p>Yarn Control Committee Implements Detailed Rules, To Be Announced Once Approved</p>
<p>The detailed implementation rules for yarn spinning and weaving, and the regulations for resident factory supervisors, have been sorted out by the committee's three-person team and were taken to Beijing by Fei Mingyang, Director of the Control Department of the Ministry of Economic Affairs, on the 25th. It is reported that once approved by the central government, the Shanghai Yarn Control Committee will be notified by telegram to announce it in advance.</p>
<p>Six District Cotton Spinning Association Appeals to the Economic Commission</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper's News] The Six District Cotton Spinning Association, in light of reports that the government is reviewing the detailed rules for the management of cotton yarn and cloth and that there has been no participation from the industry to express opinions, is unaware of the contents. This matter concerns the entire survival and future of the textile industry. Therefore, at the request of its members, the Standing Council appealed to the National Economic Commission, the Ministry of Economic Affairs, and the Yarn Control Committee, so that it can have the opportunity to contribute opinions before the announcement to show seriousness.</p>
<p>For yarn spinning and weaving, taking the form of contractual entrustment, there are daily production reports and unified tax records available, so there is no need to send resident factory supervisors. It is also reported that Council Chairman Wang Qiyu is currently in South China for inspection. The association has urgently telegraphed Wang to return to Shanghai immediately to preside over the association's affairs.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the cigarette market was stable at the opening. Later, due to active purchases by local merchants and looser cash flow in various areas, trading by non-industry players was brisk. Ten and twenty packs of British cigarettes were particularly strong. However, non-industry commodities retreated in the afternoon. As a result, ten packs of British cigarettes rose by 200,000 yuan compared to the weekend, to 34.5 million yuan, while Old Knife fell by 50,000 yuan. In addition, American packaged cigarettes rose, while Wuhu merchant cigarettes mostly declined.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the Chinese stock market saw slightly tighter cash conditions, and off-market interest rates rose, causing many to waver, so prices rose and then fell, with little trading. Off-market prices fell by 10%, and Qinxing, Zhabei, Commerce, Zhongsi, Meiya, Tongyi, Jingfang, and Rongchang were all down by 5%. The gains and losses of the remaining stocks were minor.

<p>Later, the evening report contained news that industrial loans would not be released, and Shangba fell to 757 yuan and 760 yuan. Number 54 entered the market immediately after the release, and numbers 23, 172, 65, 105, and 218 entered the delivered market, and numbers 206, 193, 8, and 157 entered the immediate market, rising to 775 yuan and 785 yuan. The national banks sold more than 100 billion, and sellers rose up, gradually retreating to 742 yuan and 752 yuan. The closing price was 748 yuan and 755 yuan. As a result, compared to the delivered stocks at the morning close, Xinguang, Xinyi, and Rongfeng each fell by 5%, and the remaining stocks all fell slightly. The delivered stocks Xinguang and Huafeng fell by 5%, and the remaining stocks all fell slightly. Among the off-market unlisted stocks, public utility stocks fell slightly, while the remaining stocks were flat.</p>
<h3 id="e146">On the Issue of Siamese Remittances (1) The Significance of Securing Siamese Remittances <a href="#e146" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c146" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">146</a></h3>
<p>By Liu Zuoren</p>
<p>Our country is a country with a huge import surplus. The trade deficit of more than 300 million yuan per year before the war was mainly offset by remittance income. Therefore, remittances are not only an important item in balancing our country's international balance of payments, a major source of replenishing our foreign exchange funds, but also greatly beneficial to our country's financial and financial relations.</p>
<p>After the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, our country was still in the position of a human surplus country, and due to the ineffectiveness of foreign policy and the shrinking of domestic production, the trade deficit became more and more severe. Not only have remittances not increased, but they have also competed to escape to Hong Kong, and the international balance of payments deficit has become larger and larger. Therefore, how to absorb remittances and reverse this trend is an important issue at present. The author has always paid great attention to the issue of remittances. Last autumn, taking the opportunity to preside over the opening of the Guangdong Provincial Bank, I contacted people from all parties and conducted on-the-spot inspections. I deeply felt the importance of securing Siamese remittances, so I wrote this article.</p>
<p>The significance of securing Siamese remittances can be described from the following three points:</p>
<p>First: From the perspective of the distribution of the Chinese population, the Siamese Chinese account for the first place in the world. According to the statistics of the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission in 1940, the total Chinese population in the world was 8,546,374, and its distribution is shown in the following table:</p>
<p>Place of Residence Population</p>
<p>Various places in North and South America 1,601,218</p>
<p>Vietnam 426,353</p>
<p>Malaya 2,300,353</p>
<p>Dutch East Indies 1,344,809</p>
<p>North Borneo 68,034</p>
<p>Burma 193,594</p>
<p>Philippines 20,500</p>
<p>Total 8,546,374</p>
<p>From the above statistics, the Siamese Chinese account for more than 34% of the total number of overseas Chinese in the world. The number of overseas Chinese compatriots is the largest. From the perspective of population proportion, we should know the importance of Siamese remittances. Especially because the Nanyang suffered the most damage during the war, and the Nanyang overseas Chinese cause and population suffered significant losses. After the war, the number of Nanyang remittances was not as good as before the war, which is expected. Siam suffered less damage during the war, and although overseas Chinese compatriots were slightly affected by the influence of Siamese anti-Chinese, it is the most convenient and promising area for securing remittances. Therefore, from the perspective of the number of overseas Chinese, we can already see the importance of Siamese remittances.</p>

<h3 id="e147">Imbalance Between Production and Consumption <a href="#e147" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c147" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">147</a></h3>
<p>— Sun Heng</p>
<p>To understand the interdependent relationship between producers and consumers, one must first understand that consumers' income is paid by producers. Not only do those engaged in agriculture and industry receive their income directly from entrepreneurs, but government taxes also come from producers, either directly paid by them or extracted from the income consumers receive from producers to be paid to the government. The government then uses the tax revenue to pay military and government personnel, making them non-direct producers. Therefore, we can define it as follows: a nation's national income is equal to the total production value of that nation.</p>
<p>Producers use their funds to pay the people, and the people use their income to buy consumer goods or capital goods, returning it to the producers. Only in this way can producers engage in reproduction and pay the people again, serving as the national income for the second period. Only then can production and consumption be balanced. If the people do not use all their income for consumption or investment, and there is a surplus of products left in the hands of producers, then this surplus, in a broad sense, is still a social investment. However, because producers already have a surplus, investment in the next period will be reduced accordingly. Consequently, the national income of the next period will also decrease, further affecting consumption. Therefore, an ideal balance between production and consumption is still difficult to achieve (because although production decreases, consumption decreases even more). This is the economic pathology of advanced European and American countries. To remedy this, one can either seek overseas markets to increase exports or increase new domestic investments, such as undertaking public works, thereby increasing national income and increasing effective demand. Moreover, due to the multiplier effect of investment expansion, new investment in one industry often stimulates investment in other industries. Consequently, national income is often several times the amount of the original new investment. Whether the purpose of increasing investment and production is to increase exports or increase domestic consumption depends on the international balance of payments situation. If it belongs to the former, then public works should be postponed to fully invest in the production of export goods. The recent British economic plan clearly belongs to the former.</p>
<p>In countries where politics are not clear, the imbalance between production and consumption is far greater than what is mentioned above, and I will describe it separately below:</p>
<p>1.  In industrially backward or agriculture-based countries, the harm is indescribable if the production value of the rural areas is not returned to the rural areas. The famous American historian George Adams, in his "Civilization During the Middle Ages," argued that the economic factor was extremely important to the fall of Rome. The aristocracy and wealthy class in Roman cities lived in extravagance and indulgence, and their wealth was actually taken from the rural areas. Moreover, they provided extensive relief to urban vagrants while imposing heavy taxes on farmers and forcibly suppressing the prices of their products. In the past, when farmers exchanged their production for urban goods, the value would still return to the rural areas, but now, the fruits of their hard work were half-consumed once they reached the cities. The capital of the rural areas was diminishing day by day, and their population continued to flee. Those who remained were mostly destitute, their spirits were dejected, and their physical strength declined daily. Good fields became barren because they were unable to fertilize them. Therefore, when the Germanic barbarian armies arrived, they collapsed at the sight of them. The once fierce and warlike spirit of the Roman people vanished like smoke. Therefore, it is more accurate to say that Rome did not resist than to say that the barbarian tribes conquered Rome. Reading history to this point, one cannot help but feel infinite regret!</p>
<p>2.  In countries where politics are unstable, the wealthy class does not invest their legitimate or illegitimate income in domestic production, but instead smuggles their funds abroad. As such, domestic production decreases, and at the same time, the total income of the people decreases. It is no different from transferring a portion of the country's savings abroad, increasing foreign production, and increasing foreign national income. If the wealth obtained from tainted blood were invested in domestic production, the result would only be an unfair distribution of wealth. However, because it is invested domestically, the capital is still temporarily paid to the people. Although in the long run, due to the unequal distribution of wealth, the purchasing power of the people declines, and thus production has to shrink as well. However, the harm is still chronic and not as severe as the disaster caused by the flight of capital overseas.</p>
<p>The transfer of international capital is inherently fluid. In countries with developed industries and surplus capital, it is not a problem to seek more favorable markets abroad to prevent overproduction. For example, after World War I, the United States invested as much as 10 billion US dollars in Germany; similarly, countries like the United Kingdom and the United States invested a considerable amount in China. However, this cannot be said of countries like China, which lack production and have short capital. Since the War of Resistance against Japan, a large amount of capital has fled China. If it were not for foreign loans and relief supplies offsetting its effect, the national economy would have been unbearable long ago.</p>
<p>3.  In countries frequently plagued by war, most able-bodied men join the army, reducing the number of workers who can be hired, easily leading to a state of full employment. If, at this juncture, more currency is issued to engage in new investments, then although the effective demand calculated in paper money increases, because the prices of raw materials and wages increase simultaneously, the amount of production still cannot increase. Unless production technology is rapidly improved, the latter may be possible, but this cannot be achieved in the short term. Moreover, because domestic order is unstable, the fleeing capital does not return, and there is no certainty of foreign investment, it is not easy to import the necessary production equipment. Trying to increase production by issuing currency is like climbing a tree to catch fish.</p>
<p>The ideal balance of consumption and production is that consumers use all their income to purchase consumer goods or investment goods. Producers also use all their income to engage in reproduction. Even if this ideal can be achieved, it is still static economics. But the evolution of society is dynamic. If the population increases and production technology does not improve, or there are no new investments, resulting in an increase in production, then the people's standard of living will be lowered. Therefore, in a dynamic society, in addition to improving production technology, it is also necessary to increase investment. Not only must all savings be used for reproduction, but in countries with short capital, it is also necessary to import foreign capital and return fleeing capital. Therefore, after the war is settled in our country, if the economic steps are not chaotic, it will still take decades of effort to achieve success. Shouldn't those who plan for the country pay attention to this!</p>
<h3 id="e148">On "Sincerity" (Part 2): The Function of "Sincerity" <a href="#e148" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c148" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">148</a></h3>
<p>— Bu Dang</p>
<p>Since the essence of "Sincerity" has been described in the previous article, its function can be discussed. The "Sincerity" of the Way of Heaven is bestowed upon humans to become their nature and bestowed upon things to become their principle. Humans are the most intelligent of all things, possessing perception, movement, thought, and action, which things may lack or possess only in a negligible degree. Therefore, the function of "Sincerity" is mostly manifested in human interactions and human treatment of things. Manifested in human interactions, it involves "establishing oneself" and "establishing others"; manifested in human treatment of things, it involves "perfecting oneself" and "perfecting things." "Establishing oneself" and "perfecting oneself" exhaust the Way of Being Human, which is called "exhausting one's nature"; "establishing others" and "perfecting things" enable people to become complete and things to find their proper place, which is called "exhausting the nature of others" and "exhausting the nature of things."</p>
<p>The "Sincerity" bestowed upon humans as their nature is either complete or partial. The complete one is "born knowing" and "acting with ease," which is called a "sincere person" (also called "utmost sincerity"); the partial one is "learning to know" and "benefiting by acting," "struggling to know" and "striving to act," which is called "one who strives for sincerity." The "sincere person" is a sage (also called a "supreme sage"), and the "one who strives for sincerity" is a virtuous person or an ordinary person. "The sincere person hits the mark without effort and attains it without thought, acting calmly in accordance with the Way"; "the one who strives for sincerity chooses the good and firmly holds onto it." "Hitting the mark without effort" refers to action; "attaining it without thought" refers to knowledge; "acting calmly in accordance with the Way" means that both knowledge and action are in accordance with the "Doctrine of the Mean," natural and effortless, without any compulsion. The heart and body, inner and outer, thoughts and actions of the "sincere person" are all in accordance with the supreme Way and principle. The supreme Way and principle, in terms of their truthfulness and absence of falsehood, are called "Sincerity"; in terms of their absence of excess or deficiency, are called "Doctrine of the Mean," but in essence, they are one and the same. The "one who strives for sincerity" constantly adds vigilance and exertion to their thoughts and actions, "choosing the good and firmly holding onto it." "Good" is the "Mean" without excess or deficiency, and is also the "Sincerity" of truthfulness and absence of falsehood, the supreme Way and principle. Having devoted their mind's knowledge to seeking clarity of the supreme Way and principle, they further use the ability of their body to embody and practice it, so as not to lose or fall behind. This is a matter of "utmost devotion to the particular," hence it is said: "Next is to devote oneself to the particular, and devotion to the particular can lead to sincerity." "Particular" means partial; "devote" means to reach, to exhaust. Partial means different things and different matters; complete means shared principles and common examples. Shared principles and common examples are the supreme Way and principle of heaven and earth, the so-called "Sincere person." "Devoting oneself to the particular" is like saying that one exhausts their knowledge of the particular, that is, examines different things and different matters, seeking to know the reason why they are so, and then unites and connects them to achieve a consistent principle. The task of "striving for sincerity" lies in this.</p>
<p>From "devoting oneself to the particular" to reaching "Sincerity" is what is called "enlightening oneself through sincerity." "Enlightening" means to understand the reason why different things and different matters are so; "Sincerity" means the principle obtained by uniting the reasons why they are so. The Doctrine of the Mean says: "Enlightening through sincerity is called nature; sincerity through enlightenment is called education. Being sincere, one becomes enlightened; being enlightened, one becomes sincere." If "Sincerity" is a principle. Principles are common, but matters are different; principles are complete, but things are partial; principles are metaphysical, and things and matters are physical. Applying the common and complete metaphysical principle to the different and partial physical matters and things, then the obscure matters will be revealed, and the ignorant things will be clarified. Hence it is said "enlightening through sincerity." Drawing inferences based on principles, leading through analogy, such as A and B being the same as C, therefore A and B are the same, is inherently a matter of ability, the nature's inherent ability, hence it is said: "Enlightening through sincerity is called nature." "Enlightening through sincerity" is a matter of academic extroversion (also called deduction). So-called "sincerity through enlightenment" means observing different things and different matters, obtaining the particular facts of their nature, the physical nature, and uniting their commonalities, understanding their completeness, and reaching the metaphysical principle. This is the work of academic introversion (also called induction), the competence of education, and the key lies here. Hence it is said, "Sincerity through enlightenment is called education." Education values experience, experience means that through what the ears and eyes have experienced, one examines the reasons why they are so, and then uses their thoughts to unite and connect them to form common principles and examples. Once the principles and examples are formed, one turns around and controls them, to manage changes, going against the current, and the application is endless, and human affairs are beneficial. "Enlightenment becomes sincerity" means to observe different things and different matters and to understand common principles and examples, the so-called "learning below and reaching above." "Sincerity becomes enlightenment" means that having understood common principles and examples, those that have not been observed can also be enlightened without observation. "The way of utmost sincerity can foresee." This is what it means.</p>
<p>With the completeness of their nature, the innate endowment of "born knowing" and "acting with ease," the so-called sage of "Sincerity," their "establishing oneself," "establishing others," "perfecting oneself," and "perfecting things" are natural and effortless, without waiting for the effort of cultivation. As for the partiality of their nature, the quality of "learning," "benefiting," "struggling," and "striving," the so-called virtuous person and ordinary person who "strive for sincerity," they become so only after doing, reach it only after cultivating, and the so-called "devoting oneself to the particular" and "sincerity through enlightenment" is their work. However, "devotion to the particular can lead to sincerity." Accumulating the work of "devoting oneself to the particular" will eventually lead to "Sincerity"; fully understanding the reasons why different things and different matters are so will also lead to their unification and connection, and reaching the supreme Way and principle of heaven and earth, and thus reaching "Sincerity." Hence it is said: "And when their knowledge is one," "and when their success is one." Generally, people must experience things and matters inside and outside their hearts and bodies before they can know and be able to do them, tasting the bitterness and sweetness themselves, and bearing the benefits and harms themselves. Therefore, their use of their hearts is painful, and their efforts are diligent. This is what is meant by "struggling" and "striving." Taking a step further to draw on the experiences of others, using what they see and hear for knowledge, and relying on imitation for ability, is what is called learning to know. Learning and then knowing, knowing and then being able to do, without struggling or striving, is what is called "benefiting." The highest are those who do not need to experience or practice, nor rely on what they see and hear for imitation, but quietly think and silently observe, unite and connect, and touch the similar by analogy, applying it to real things and matters, as if knowing without learning and being able to do without practice. This is what is called "born knowing" and "acting with ease." For these three levels, their knowledge has difficulty and ease, but when they know it, they all share this principle of heaven and earth, which is inherently what their nature is able to know. Their ability has slowness and speed, but when they are able to do it, they all share this matter of things and people, which is inherently what their nature is capable of doing. Therefore, what they know and what they achieve are one and the same. Thus, the innate sage and the man-made sage achieve the same merit. Sages, virtuous people, and ordinary people take different paths but reach the same destination. This is why sages and virtuous people are attainable. (To be continued)</p>
<h3 id="e149">This Year's International Academic Conference <a href="#e149" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c149" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">149</a></h3>
<p>— Li Ren</p>
<p>This year, world academic conferences are becoming active. War hinders the progress of such conferences, but when we still have time to think about post-war reconstruction issues and the maintenance of peace, we cannot but think about them. "One can conquer the world on horseback, but one cannot govern it on horseback." When armed forces cease, it is naturally the day when academics rise. Academics have deeply suffered from the pain of war, and how can they not think after the pain has subsided? Although academics may not necessarily have the power to prevent war, they have a responsibility to prevent it. Perhaps this is one reason why this year's world academic conferences are particularly lively.</p>
<p>There seem to be quite a few international academic conferences to be held this year. Let the author first report on two of them. One is the Tenth International Philosophical Conference, and the other is the Twelfth International Psychological Conference.</p>
<p>We know that the Ninth International Philosophical Conference was held in Paris in 1937. After the conference, the Dutch government was invited to hold the Tenth Conference in the Netherlands in September 1941. However, the ruthless war hindered this conference. In February 1940, the person in charge of this conference decided to postpone it indefinitely. Soon, the entire Netherlands was occupied by the Nazis, and Professor Leonard Polak, chairman of the conference, was also arrested and sent to the concentration camp where he died tragically. The war's destruction of academics is a clear example of this. Now, the person in charge of the conference has decided to reconvene it in Amsterdam, the Netherlands, in August or September of this year (the date is not yet certain). At the same time, the International Cultural and Educational Organization (UNESCO) has also decided to support it, so there should be no problem with the holding of this conference. In view of the complexity of current philosophical trends, this conference accepts this complexity without the illusion of unity. However, they are also unwilling for this conference to be just a place for ideological struggle. Therefore, they decided to propose a theme for this conference. The theme is: "Ideas of Man, Humanity, and Mankind." They believe that these ideas are the common origin of various different thoughts and their common problem. To provide a philosophical explanation of these ideas, mutual consultation is necessary. Moreover, when discussing these ideas, it is also necessary to seek the help of other sciences, such as sociology, psychology, mind science, anthropology, and cultural history. In addition to the theme, specialized philosophical issues, such as epistemology, axiology, and metaphysics, are naturally also on the agenda. However, when possible, the discussion of these issues should also be related to the theme. Judging from the theme of this conference, we know that world philosophers have indeed undergone a transformation, that is, a transformation to what the American philosopher Dewey called "the problem of man." And this transformation is exactly the same as the traditional philosophical thought that has been consistently inherited in our country. Because our country's traditional philosophy, no matter what the problem, is always related to life and does not leave life. Therefore, the author sincerely hopes that philosophers from our country can participate in this conference. The chairman of this conference is H. J. Pos of the Netherlands, the secretary is E. W. Beth, and the correspondence address is: Bern. Zweerskade 23I. Amsterdam-z.</p>
<p>The Twelfth International Psychological Conference was originally scheduled to be held in 1940 and was also postponed due to the impact of the war. The conference has now decided to hold it in Edinburgh, Scotland, from July 23 to 29 this year. Because psychology itself is related to the issue of human nature, this conference will naturally not ignore the issue of human nature. It is also very important for people from the psychological community in our country to participate. The chairman of the organizing committee of the conference is James Drever, the general secretary is Godfrey Thomson, and the correspondence address is: Moray House Ecinburgh 8.</p>
<h3 id="e150">Urban Environment and Mental Illness <a href="#e150" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c150" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">150</a></h3>
<p>— Fang Zheng</p>
<p>The urban environment or modern civilization has been regarded by many as a breeding ground for neurosis. Many people feel that the bustling stimulation of cities is an important cause of mental illness. Neurosis is a very serious problem, and the causes are very complex. Recently, social research in this area has yielded some commendable results, and looking at this problem from the perspective of the urban environment yields some fresh meanings.</p>
<p>"Mental Disorders in Urban Areas" by R. E. L. Fari and H. W. Dunham, published in 1937, starts from this point of view. Based on the initial diagnostic statistics of public and private hospitals in Chicago and its vicinity, they studied the relationship between mental illness and the urban environment. The results were the same as those of Shaw and Mckay's previous investigation into criminals. Farris and Dunham also divided Chicago into six types of areas: a bustling area, the city center where brothels are located; a boarding area, the center of hotels, apartments, and vagrants (Hobo); slums; tenement districts; residential areas; and luxurious residential areas. They found that the rate of neurosis had a very obvious relationship with this type of zoning. For example, from the center to the northwest, the frequency of each area is: 362, 177, 95, 71, 65, 55. If the zoning is more detailed, the results are more obvious, with the highest reaching 499 and the lowest only 48. The above numbers are based on the total number of initial diagnoses from 1922 to 1934. However, because the population of each district varies greatly, the above numbers are just a ratio, that is, taking the population of people over fifteen years old in 1930 per 100,000 as a benchmark.</p>
<p>Such results may have multiple different explanations, and it is not necessary to assume that mental illness is related to the urban environment. First, poor people or single men have to go to the hospital after they get sick, while rich people can recuperate at home, so there are more sick poor people. Second, perhaps it is not the environment that produces mental illness, but the possibility of having these diseases flows to these areas. Because of illness, one becomes poor, and because of poverty, one has to move to the slums. Therefore, the cause and effect may actually be reversed. Third, perhaps it can be explained by race instead of environment. For example, black people are mostly concentrated in poor areas, or perhaps the black race is inherently more prone to neurosis. The cause and effect of phenomena cannot be thought of solely from the surface.</p>
<p>However, Farris and Dunham's detailed results cannot all be explained in this way, and their results have at least six similar studies—in other cities in the United States—that can be cited as corroboration. We will now briefly cite a few special examples from their research. For example, the geographical distribution of schizophrenia is different from the geographical distribution of manic-depressive illness. The distribution of schizophrenia is roughly similar to the general results mentioned above, but manic-depressive illness does not seem to have this kind of regional difference. Moreover, speaking solely from schizophrenia, because of the complexity of the disease, its distribution also varies depending on the type of disease. Paranoid schizophrenia is concentrated in apartment and hotel areas, catatonic schizophrenia is more common in poor areas concentrated by foreigners, and such differences make us believe that the environment cannot be completely unrelated to mental symptoms.</p>
<p>Why is schizophrenia a disease of the poor? We must first know the cause of schizophrenia. It is a split, that is, an extreme introversion symptom in which the individual loses contact with reality. If we investigate how a person becomes alienated from reality, a large part of this has to be blamed on the environment. People are born to be gregarious. However, poor children have to alienate themselves from society because of social discrimination and live in isolation. The more isolated from reality, the more misunderstandings, and they blame all their personal disappointments on social obstruction and constraints, and they imagine everyone persecuting them. In this way, they think they have a remarkable origin and superhuman instincts, and the paranoid delusions gradually deepen. The urban environment further increases this force. People come and go, and no one cares about anyone's well-being, which results in a person having to increase their introverted tendencies and flow into the disease of schizophrenia.</p>
<p>The fact that manic-depressive illness does not seem to have a regional distinction does not necessarily mean that manic-depressive illness is unrelated to the environment. For example, Krout believes that this is due to the sequential relationship of the roots of the disease. The source of schizophrenia is early frustration, while the source of manic-depressive illness is later frustration. Early frustration is mostly due to family finances, while later frustration may have multiple causes and not entirely depend on family finances. Therefore, manic-depressive illness is not as specific to poor people as schizophrenia. According to the research of the German psychologist Kretchmer, manic-depressive patients are mostly pyknic types, and the pyknic type seems to be more common among the rich. Therefore, manic-depressive illness may be said to be a disease of the rich. This view may not be entirely appropriate, but the relationship between mental illness and the environment does not seem to be without basis.</p>

<p>— Zhang Qiyun</p>
<p>U.S.-Soviet Relations</p>
<p>Last September 20th was the eightieth birthday of Mr. Henry L. Stimson of the United States. The "Foreign Affairs" magazine, founded in the autumn of 1922 (also translated as "Quarterly Journal of Diplomacy"), also coincided with its 25th anniversary. Mr. Stimson was specially invited to write an article for the anniversary issue (October of this year), the first essay, entitled "The Challenge to Americans." Stimson served as Secretary of War during President Taft's administration, and President Hoover appointed him as Secretary of State. During President Roosevelt's era, he was appointed as Secretary of War. In 1931, when the September 18th Incident occurred, Stimson advocated using force to confront Japan's aggressive policies. He spoke out justly and has always been a friend of China. During World War II, Stimson aided China in mobilizing the nation to defeat Germany and Japan, establishing immortal achievements. In his essay in "Foreign Affairs," after discussing U.S.-Soviet relations, he specifically expressed his belief that the United States today should aim for the world's freedom and prosperity, contributing its boundless national strength. "Foreign Affairs" magazine is a well-established publication in the United States with a high academic standing. We should pay close attention to the words of this old statesman. Although this article speaks for the American people, it is also a valuable warning for the Chinese people.</p>
<p>Victory and peace are not synonymous. Currently, most parts of the world are merely in a state of armed truce, and some places have already openly opened fire. The path to lasting peace and stability is extremely distant. The world crisis came with victory, and the biggest crisis is the discord between the United States and the Soviet Union. Stimson recalled that President Roosevelt repeatedly wanted to build friendly relations with the Soviet Union, treating the Soviet Union with goodwill, and hoping that the Soviet Union could also treat the United States with goodwill. Unfortunately, before President Roosevelt passed away in the spring of 1945, the Soviet Union had already expressed an unfriendly attitude towards the United States. Stimson greatly admired the Soviet people's loyal and courageous fighting but said that the people currently in power in the Soviet Union believe that the American style of democracy and freedom has reached its end, which runs counter to the Soviet style. The United States hopes that the Soviet Union will become a good friend, and such friendship is beneficial to the Soviet Union. But at least for the time being, the Soviet Union considers the United States to be outdated and goes its own way. Communist parties around the world follow the Soviet Union's lead, and there is a tendency to intensify this trend. Stimson believes that if Americans do not recognize this fact, and think that if we are friendly to the Soviet Union, the Soviet Union will be friendly to us, it is either self-deception or utter foolishness. These words were of course directed at people like Wallace.</p>
<p>Stimson claimed that his attitude is not passive, let alone anti-Russian. It is only to make the Soviet Union truly know that freedom and prosperity are not mutually exclusive and that both can coexist in the Western democratic world. The American people should examine themselves and devote themselves to production. Diplomacy and domestic affairs are inseparable. It is indeed true that America's prosperity depends on the world's prosperity. It is equally reasonable to say that the world's economic future depends on America's economic future. The United States must strive to create a new standard of peacetime production. Laziness, hesitation, and irresponsibility are incurable problems. Unless production increases, there is no point in talking about increasing wages and profits. The United States should also use this spirit to quickly rescue Western Europe and other places from disappointment, hunger, and terror. The faster it is done, the less it costs, and the greater the success. Freedom requires tolerance. Under the principle of human dignity, there can be different forms of free society, and they do not all have to be exactly the same as the United States. If the United States can make freedom and prosperity a reality in this world, then communism will not become a threat. If it cannot, regardless of whether there is communism or not, our civilization will eventually fail. Soviet leaders pay attention to reality. We should respond to them with concrete facts so that they know that if they do not change their goals, they will lose their position. Only in this way will it be effective. Otherwise, merely engaging in blind anti-communism will cause our efforts to be in vain.</p>
<p>Stimson believes that the United States cannot continue to tolerate the Soviet Union's expansionist policies and arbitrarily advance into areas emptied by the war. The United States must make it clear that it is by no means an expansionist. America's responsibility is to help threatened people help themselves. This is by no means easy and requires a brave and mobile policy, and capable and sensitive implementation. The construction of peace cannot be undertaken by one country alone, but the preparation for war can be decided by one country. The United States must maintain a strong military force to make aggressors wary. We also know that Russians are not happy to fight and that a non-aggressive Soviet Union has nothing to fear from the United States. The United States is the first country to use atomic energy. American personnel have a sacred mission. Atomic energy should make mankind prosperous and not cause mankind to self-destruct. Within the borders of the United States, there is still the freedom to protect freedom. This point must not be taken lightly. If we are timid and evade responsibility, or even isolate ourselves from the world and stand idly by, war may be unavoidable.</p>
<p>The establishment of a world government and the control of atomic energy are impossible without Soviet participation. However, the United Nations is currently paralyzed due to the frequent use of the veto. Stimson believes that the United States should devote all its efforts to revitalize the authority of the United Nations. If the Soviet Union cannot be honest with each other, it is better to raise a clear banner of opposition. The first chapter of the United Nations clearly states that it should have the power to investigate and report on world issues and cannot be denied by the veto of any major power. Stimson firmly believes that the United States has the power to solve major world problems but cannot take a half-hearted attitude, nor can it give up halfway. The way to solve difficulties lies in reason and will, and the country's basic policies must be backed by the understanding of the people. The United States has unlimited responsibility for the world, and all public and private plans and policies should be set against the background of the whole world. The problems of Asia and Europe are the problems of the United States. Political and economic isolationism must be eliminated. Today, the duty of the United States is to use its unlimited national power to strive for the world's freedom and prosperity.</p>

<h3 id="e152">### Record of Today's Peach Blossom Spring <a href="#e152" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c152" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">152</a></h3>
<p>— Lei Hong</p>
<p>There is such a place where people do not have to worry about the coming of atomic bombs, and income tax is only one percent. The Prime Minister does not need to put on the airs of a politician, but spends most of his time leading a troop of Boy Scouts. This place does not know what divorce is, has no poor people, and nine-tenths of the people enjoy an old age of over sixty.</p>
<p>Is it Shangri-La? Or Utopia? It is not. It is a small country located between Austria and Switzerland, nestled in the mountains of the Alps: Liechtenstein.</p>
<p>The people of the country are always happy. When they cross the border and look at Europe, which is shrouded in famine, distress, and war, they congratulate themselves and doubt what the "enlightened" giants who are causing a stir are doing. They entrusted the Allied planes to bomb the Zeppelin factory on the shore of Lake Constance. That night, there were tragic beacon fires on the northern horizon. How can we remember it? On this evening, the capital of the country, Vaduz, was full of fireworks celebrating the birth of a son to Head of State Joseph II and his wife, Princess Georgina.</p>
<p>The people of the country can eat good and abundant but simple food, and it is easy to buy, without relying on the black market. Morality is high, and criminal incidents are rare. Therefore, prisons are empty and can only be rented to neighboring Switzerland for the detention of an occasional resister.</p>
<p>But do not think that the people of the country are unsociable hermits. They are probably the most compassionate people in the world. For every three people, one is an active member of the Red Cross, serving the ravaged neighboring countries and rescuing people who lack food and clothing and are afflicted with poverty and disease.</p>
<p>When Hitler went straight into Austria and then wanted to sweep the country, the country sent a troop of Boy Scouts to the border, and along the way, some farmers left their fields, casually picking up something as a weapon, and confronted the German army. The German army hesitated when it saw this strange team. The Nazis finally withdrew and respected the neutrality of the Kingdom of Liechtenstein.</p>
<p>The day Joseph ascended the throne was the day Hitler's army occupied Austria. The king likes to read modern literature, appreciates classical music, and often plays with his children. The government respects the constitution and practices democracy. A petition signed by four hundred people can influence Congress. The people of the country do not pay taxes to the royal family—the income tax is one cent per dollar.</p>
<p>Regarding the reason for the low tax rate, Prime Minister Frick said it well: "Of course, we have no military expenditures, because we do not need an army, navy, or air force. We do not have to run social enterprises, because everyone has enough land to support their family. And our stamps are sought after by stamp collectors around the world, and we are naturally happy to supply them. Setting up customs and tax bureaus is too expensive, so we lease this 'right' to Switzerland to collect taxes on our behalf. Even her foreign policy is handled by Switzerland, saving the cost of sending envoys."</p>
<p>Foreign factories take advantage of the fact that the country has no labor unions and have gone to open branches, thereby developing their operations—because the country only has "family unity." For example, a hotel manager had a small dispute with a butcher in Vaduz. As a result, the manager was unwilling to do business with him anymore. But when the hotel roof leaked, all the plasterers claimed that they had other work and refused to repair it. The plumbers and electricians also made excuses when needed. Later, the manager was replaced before the hotel business could be revitalized. It seemed that all the technicians were relatives and friends of the butcher.</p>
<p>The country has one movie theater, which is only open on Sundays. Because people have to work on weekdays, and they should rest in the evenings. Children under the age of eighteen are not allowed in the theater; the films shown are limited to those that do not represent the extravagant life of Hollywood. They point out that films with debauchery cannot make people feel happy and satisfied.</p>
<p>According to Frick, the reason why the Liechtenstein can live peacefully in the world is, "We have a rich way of seeking happiness, but we lack the dream of conquerors."</p>
<h3 id="e153">### Cold Wave in Beiping <a href="#e153" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c153" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">153</a></h3>
<p>— Liu Yansheng</p>
<p>According to the meteorological station, the cold in Beiping this year is the most severe in ten years, with the thermometer reading seventeen degrees below zero, which is unprecedented in previous years.</p>
<p>The cold in Beiping has been recorded in poems and books by the ancients many times. On this occasion of extreme cold, discussing the writings of predecessors about the cold in Beiping can also serve as an introduction to the local customs of Beiping and can also provide more assistance in conversation, matching Li Du's.</p>
<p>Shushi Jiayi Youcao entrusted Gong Youying with saying: "A gust of wind howls in the wilderness, shooting my jade skin with goosebumps. I go out in the morning wearing a fox fur coat, and sleep at night with heron-like curled feet; my shins shrink under the quilt, and half the bed is not too crowded." This poem describes the meaning of coldness, and it can be said that it has been depicted to the fullest. If one has not experienced it personally, one cannot be so profound.</p>
<p>Guizhai Ji's Ouyang Yuangong's Fisherman's Pride words say: "Sable sleeves, leopard robes, and silver rat felt, beauties come and go in felt carts." It also describes the state of life in the cold of Beiping. Although the taste of coldness in the mansions of the rich is slightly reduced, they use precious fur coats to keep out the cold, not only to show off their wealth but also because precious fur coats are not enough to resist the extreme cold.</p>
<p>The Fengyue Yutan Lu records: "The climate of the capital is bitterly cold, and fires are lit every year on the first day of October until the first day of February. However, on extremely cold days, even fire is not warm." The Yanjing Suishi Ji and Chunming Caifeng Zhi both have this record. In the winter cold of Beiping, people all regard the brazier as a gift of grace. There are many forms of braziers, many methods, and most of them are locally made in Beiping, exquisite and durable. The Yanjing Suishi Ji records: "The brazier is made of non-ash wood, which is whiter than jade stone, light, warm, strong, and durable." The Chunming Caifeng Zhi also records: "Most of the braziers use non-ash wood, because it is warm all around. The smaller ones in the brazier are short and fat, called 'little fat boys'. Poor families use flower pots to hold them, the smaller ones cherish them, saving money and making them last. In recent years, there are people who make them with , which are light and convenient." This is nothing less than a short history of the braziers of Beiping. Non-ash wood is a special product of Beiping, produced in the Western Hills, belonging to minerals, durable, and has a particularly strong heating power. In the past, there were many shops in Beiping that sold non-ash wood braziers. In the past ten years, people have mostly used foreign stoves, and those made of non-ash wood have fallen behind. These shops have also changed their business one after another, and non-ash wood braziers have become historical terms. If you look for them in the families of Beiping, there are still some that are still in use and not broken. Every winter, they are taken out and used, and they should be regarded as treasures. In addition to non-ash wood, there are also those who use copper stoves, which are magnificent. However, copper stoves are the nature of the stove cover, with a stove core in the middle. After the fire is lit, it is placed in a copper cover. The stove core is made of iron, and many are also made of non-ash wood. Since the popularity of new-style foreign stoves, this kind of antique-style brazier has been abandoned by people.</p>
<p>From the brazier, let's talk about coal. Beiping is a coal-producing area. Mentougou in the northwest suburb is the general meeting place of coal. In the past, it was specially for the use of Beiping. The Shuicao Qingxia Lu said: "The price of coal in the Western Hills is not very high, and it is quite profitable." It can be seen that coal is a special product of Beiping. The Sichaoshi Shi contains Wu Yangyuan's poem on coal balls, which is mostly ancient and obscure. The so-called: "The north is bitterly cold, and the Western Hills are rich in nurturing. Cheng Caihuo sends stones, competing with Sui zuanmu." It also said: "The mud pill is majestic in Qin Guan, and the charcoal group is unique to Song Chen. Utilizing super-Su, bestowing the name Jia Cuju." Coal balls are used in poetry, or this is the first choice.</p>
<p>The ancients often described the cold in the north as dropping fingers and cracking skin, and even reading Fang Xiang's poem recorded in the Jintai Youxue Cao, the so-called: "The cold of Yanshan is not found in the south, and in October, the mountains are already surrounded by foxes. In the daytime, the wind is like cutting the face, and the night air is like a micro-skin." Now that the cold wave still wants to stay, the cold is even worse. As I write this, my heart is still shivering.</p>
<h3 id="e154">### The Struggle of Foreign Envoys to Meet the Emperor in the Late Qing Dynasty <a href="#e154" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c154" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">154</a></h3>
<p>— Yifeng</p>
<p>Before the Opium War, the Manchu Qing dynasty closed itself off to the outside world, and there was no diplomacy to speak of. Later, Britain, France, the United States, and Russia established embassies in Beijing, which opened the door. However, the important ministers of the court at that time were either ignorant and arrogant or ignorant. Therefore, the slowness of Qing diplomacy, from "despising foreigners" to "fawning on foreigners" to "fearing foreigners," was full of jokes. When people read it today, they still have mixed feelings of laughter and tears.</p>
<p>For example, after the British and French War, embassies of European and American countries were successively established in Beijing. According to European and American practice, the envoys must meet the head of the host country and present their credentials, which is also an indispensable etiquette. However, the Qing court repeatedly refused to do so. Xianfeng was afraid of meeting them and would rather not return to Beijing. When Tongzhi succeeded to the throne, the foreign envoys requested an audience, but the Prime Minister's Office refused on the grounds that the Empress Dowager was in power and that men and women should not be in close contact. The only reason they refused the foreign envoys' audience was the dispute between the Chinese slave-style kneeling ceremony and the Western-style bow. At that time, those old and decaying ministers of the Prime Minister's Office and the frontier officials all believed that not kneeling was a major matter that insulted the national dignity and was unruly. The words of Ding Shizhen, the governor of Shandong, can be taken as a representative of the general court officials' discussion. He said: "Since they do not practice Chinese etiquette, their unruly spirit will be difficult to subdue... If they are allowed to enter the audience, I am afraid that in the future, even the smallest matters will trouble the Emperor... It seems better to refuse politely in advance to prevent it." Wu Dacheng even said: "Our country's system has never had a method of not kneeling. The etiquette of the court is the system left by our ancestors." Not only did he raise the big hat of "ancestors," but he also believed that if foreign envoys did not kneel, "all the people in the world" would be aroused by "resentment and dissatisfaction." I really don't know what he based this on, and his ignorance is also known.</p>
<p>What is especially ridiculous is that in 1872 (the eleventh year of Tongzhi), Emperor Tongzhi got married. The foreign ambassadors in Beijing thought that when China had such a grand ceremony, they would definitely be invited to participate, and they could also take this opportunity to satisfy their curiosity about seeing the Chinese emperor. Who knew that things were very different? Before this big day, they were not only not invited, but the side sent someone named to each embassy to inform them that on that auspicious day, all foreigners should not walk on the streets, simply treating the foreigners at that time as ominous floods and beasts. Naturally, this aroused the dissatisfaction of the foreign envoys. The following year, Tongzhi took power, and the foreign envoys firmly demanded an audience in advance. For a time, there was a lot of discussion in the court. Some strongly opposed it, thinking that if this precedent was set, foreign envoys could take the opportunity to blackmail the emperor at any time; some even requested to deploy troops to frighten them, as Bian Shiquan said: "The Emperor should make a sole decision and refuse to see them, and instruct the Chinese and foreign ministers to strictly deploy troops to uphold the dignity of the court and to prevent the arrogance of foreign barbarians." It was simply going to declare war on the outside world. In the end, it was Li Hongzhang and a few other ministers who were slightly more understanding who adopted the compromise method of "only allowing one audience, not allowing another, only allowing all envoys to see together once, not allowing one country to ask for a separate audience" to solve this struggle for audience. They also changed the Western three bows to five bows to show respect. The foreign envoys of various countries had no choice but to comply.</p>
<p>Afterwards, the Beijing newspaper exaggeratedly recorded such a ridiculous process, saying:</p>
<p>"The British envoy first recited about two or three words of the credential, and then trembled all over. The Emperor said, "Is your Emperor healthy?" The British envoy could not answer. The Emperor also said, "If you want to visit Us, what is your intention? Tell it to Us quickly." He still could not answer. The envoys all presented their credentials in order. Some dropped their credentials to the ground, and some could not answer when the Emperor asked. Then he and Prince Gong were ordered to leave. However, after the fear, their feet could not move, and when they reached the resting place, they were sweating profusely, so that they could not attend the banquet given by the Zongli Yamen. Afterwards, Prince Gong said to the envoys, "I once told you that visiting the Emperor is not something to be taken lightly as a children's play; you did not believe it, but what is the result now? Are the Chinese like you foreigners, who are as light as chicken feathers!""</p>
<p>Was this really the case? I'm afraid only the people at that time knew!</p>
<h3 id="e155">### Talking About Pickpockets <a href="#e155" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c155" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">155</a></h3>
<p>— Leli</p>
<p>Recently, I saw in the newspaper that a reader requested the elimination of pickpockets in a letter. It is said that pickpockets are extremely rampant in the money shop area between Henan Road and Shandong Road on Ningbi Road, and there are many victims. I also saw in the newspaper that a six-year-old girl stole a huge diamond. Although the police station has been investigating in Beijing and Shanghai, the principal has fled to Hong Kong, etc. It can be seen how active the pickpockets in this city are, and how superb their methods are! A few days ago, because I went to the post office to buy stamps, I was also "patronized" by these people. 500,000 yuan of legal tender in my pocket was snatched away, and I really shared the reader's feelings.</p>
<p>The reason I say "patronized again" is because I have been coveted by pickpockets many times before. This is the third time. The first time was as early as twelve years ago, on a tram on French Concession Road. It was a summer day. I was wearing a silk long gown, and the silk short gown on the fur surface was cut with a seam, and a wallet was lost. I was very clear when I lost it, but how could I catch the thief red-handed? I could only let it go. Fortunately, the money and things were all in my hand, and there was nothing in the wallet except photos and keys. Therefore, I paid great attention and thought that I had learned a lesson once I had suffered a loss.</p>
<p>Sure enough, I had experience the second time. In the winter of the year of victory, I returned to Shanghai and took trolleybus No. 17 on Fuzhou Road. I felt something different in the crowd, so I stroked my whole body with my hand, trying not to come into contact with people, and at the same time pressed down on my inner pocket. When I got off the bus, I saw that the pocket of the silk cotton short gown had been cut with a seam in the same style as before, but the few Customs Gold Units in the pocket were fortunately not leaked out.</p>
<p>When the newspaper reported some time ago that the police station was clearing out pickpockets on a large scale and ordered them to demonstrate their skills in public, I often told people about these two things, thinking that being pickpocketed was always due to my own carelessness. Who knew that I would lose if I talked too much? This time was terrible. At nine o'clock in the morning on the 14th, because it was convenient, I went to the Wusong Road Post Office to buy some stamps. I was standing in line in front of the counter, and it was a little crowded. Suddenly, I felt light in my pocket. I let go of my hand and touched it, and the buttons were undone. The money was gone. I thought I had experience, so I didn't make a sound at the time. I bought the stamps as usual and went to the police booth in front of the post office (now at the street corner). There are many such booths to report the loss, but the police officer was not very interested. Later, I heard that I was a government employee, so he reluctantly went into the post office with me and took a look, and said to me: "If you had announced it earlier, closed the door, and then I came, you could have caught him. Now, how can you catch him?" Naturally, I had to give up.</p>
<p>It is true that people who are pickpocketed are careless. Who told me to be distracted that day? If I could have concentrated my attention, the pickpockets would probably still be unable to use their skills; however, the chaos and complexity of this city life greatly increases their opportunities, which is a fact.</p>
<p>What is strange is that, as I see it, these pickpockets, at least the pickpockets near the bank and post office, are quite easy to catch. The reason why they are still active and getting worse seems to be some factors of "not being able to do it." If I have time, I will definitely learn the foolishness of a certain student who was also reported in the newspaper some time ago, tie a thread on a fountain pen, arrange the bait, and catch one or two pickpockets to try.</p>
<h3 id="e156">### Long Faces and Round Faces <a href="#e156" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c156" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">156</a></h3>
<p>— Wang Dingyi</p>
<p>When I was working at the National Kindergarten Normal School, I heard a lecture by Mr. Chen Heqin. He said: "There are three treasures in life: a mirror, a notebook, and a pen, and a cross." He meant to use a mirror to look at your own face to see if it is round or long? Generally, a round face is pleasant, and a long face is annoyed. That is to say: the joy, anger, sorrow, and happiness in your heart are shown on your face for others to see.</p>
<p>The reporter feels that in today's society, there are really too many annoying things to count. No wonder there are disturbances in all classes of society. Everyone has anger in their hearts. As long as there is a disagreement, they will start to fight, so they fight each other and cause a storm.</p>
<p>In fact, this is unnecessary. If the liver fire is strong, it will burn immediately, but we have to look in the mirror often ourselves. If we are annoyed in our hearts and always have a long face, and then use it to deal with others, the other party was originally happy and wanted to talk and say something with you. When they meet your noble face, they have to put away their smile and become serious. Then, the originally harmonious and relaxed atmosphere becomes awkward. Even if the other party happens to be unhappy, and they want to vent, when they see your iron plate face, they are right in the middle of their heart. If there is a disagreement, the liver fire will rise, and both sides will compete, resulting in both sides being hurt!</p>
<p>Therefore, I think that a long face is more likely to attract trouble, while a round face is called a spring breeze, a harmonious atmosphere, and everyone likes to see it. Why must we hang a long face and make people hate and fear us?</p>
<p>If we have problems, annoyances, and difficulties, we might as well be gentle and sincere to discuss with others and think of a way to solve the difficulties and eliminate the annoyances. Why must we hang a long face and seriously argue?</p>

<p>Chapter Nine: Leaking Secrets (54)</p>
<p>Zhu Zhai initially declined, saying he had matters to attend to. Later, Yun Qing told him that her mother had returned from Tianjin and he must go, and she also asked him to come for dinner. Zhu Zhai had no choice but to agree. That evening, after arriving at the Gu residence, he invited Qi Wan out, bought a carpet, and Qi Wan accompanied him to the East Asia Building for dinner. Zhu Zhai said he had other engagements, and after sending Qi Wan home, he hurried to Yun Qing's house. Yun Qing's mother, upon seeing Zhu Zhai, showed extraordinary warmth, asking about everything. She strongly disapproved of Zhu Zhai living in the bank's dormitory, believing that living away from home without anyone to care for him was very inconvenient. She suggested he either return home or move into her house. Zhu Zhai was deeply moved by the old woman's enthusiasm. He felt that Mrs. Zhang's attitude toward him since returning from Tianjin was so fervent because she knew about his divorce from Hu Sheng and had high expectations for him. However, he doubted that this situation would have a good outcome and feared a major backlash in the future. Therefore, seeing Mrs. Zhang's warm hospitality, he felt increasingly uneasy. That evening, Mrs. Zhang specially prepared many dishes that Zhu Zhai usually liked, and Yun Qing eagerly urged him to drink. Zhu Zhai, moved by the enthusiasm of the mother and daughter, couldn't help but drink heavily, becoming completely drunk. He ended up lying on the sofa, snoring away. Mrs. Zhang, fearing he would catch a chill, instructed Yun Qing to help him to a room to rest. Yun Qing led him to the outer study, to a small cot. Seeing that his tie was tied tightly around his neck, she casually loosened it and took off his jacket, helping him lie down. As she hung his jacket on the coat rack, she saw a paper packet fall from his pocket. Yun Qing picked it up and saw that it was a stack of photographs developed by the Wang Xing Photography Studio. Overcome by curiosity, she opened the packet and pulled out the photographs. She found that they were pictures of Qi Wan. Two of them were casual shots, and one in particular was most jarring: a photo of Qi Wan and Zhu Zhai together. Qi Wan was sitting in a chair, and Zhu Zhai was sitting on the armrest to her left, with one hand on Qi Wan's shoulder, appearing very intimate. Yun Qing, upon seeing this photograph, felt a surge of intense emotion. She bit her firm lips and looked at Zhu Zhai, wanting nothing more than to wake him up and demand an explanation. Standing in the center of the room, she hesitated for a long time, finally concluding that he was drunk, and even if she asked him now, he might not be able to give a coherent answer. She had always suspected Zhu Zhai's actions, and today she could prove that he indeed had another lover in his heart, and that the object of his affection was none other than the most detestable Qi Wan. This matter needed to be addressed. However, confronting him with just this one photograph would not be sufficient; she needed concrete evidence, to catch him at a weak point, to question him thoroughly and make him submit. But after this incident, their relationship would inevitably be severed. Thinking of this, Yun Qing's anger turned to heartache, and tears streamed down her face. Unable to bear it any longer, she ran to her own room, collapsed on the bed, and began to sob uncontrollably.</p>
<h3 id="e158">Stealing Leisure in Busyness <a href="#e158" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c158" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">158</a></h3>
<p>— Ji Mo</p>
<p>Life is busy and tense, everyone has their own career, everyone has their own future. Even the pleasures of the city, such as pre-ordering theater tickets, reserving seats in restaurants, and finding empty seats in crowded dance halls, require you to set aside some time and treat it as a serious matter. Otherwise, being turned away at the last minute will only double your disappointment.</p>
<p>However, the loveliness of life perhaps lies in a bit of leisure amidst all the busyness. In a speeding train, a glimpse of a vibrant young branch from the window can moisten our souls. Our work may seem to keep us impossibly busy every day, but we can always find moments of leisure to free ourselves from mental and physical constraints.</p>
<p>I once encountered a Harvard University graduate, with whom I had a passing acquaintance, on the street. He was working as a street-level employee in an American company, wearing a crisp suit. It was last autumn, and he was chewing chestnuts while carefully reading the newspapers posted on the street. You might say he lacked gentlemanly manners, but he was undoubtedly a philosopher who understood the joys of life.</p>
<p>On another occasion, while riding the number 10 bus, the passenger next to me was a Western woman in her thirties, carrying a handbag full of newspapers and various items. Her clothes were simple, but her attire was clean and tidy, giving the impression of a Jewish housewife. She seemed to be going to the downtown area to shop, or perhaps returning from shopping. After sitting for a minute or two, she pulled out a first-grade Chinese textbook from her bag and, with a relaxed and contented manner, began to write clumsily in a square grid notebook: "Come read, everyone come read..." as if she were studying an interesting lesson.</p>
<p>Sometimes, even in a serious office where the atmosphere is heavy, a touch of levity stolen from busyness is undeniable. Once, I visited a foreigner who was in charge of economic research. He had bright blue eyes, light yellow hair, and the snow-white cuffs of his shirt protruded from the sleeves of his light blue, narrow-striped suit.</p>
<p>After I finished discussing business with him, a boy brought in a kraft paper package and placed it on the foreigner's desk. He looked it over and said to me, "This is a Christmas gift sent from America on December 12th of last year, it's finally arrived." This had nothing to do with my business, but it was full of human warmth, suggesting that he was willing to chat with me for a few minutes amidst his busy schedule. Unfortunately, I was short on time and had to say goodbye.</p>
<h3 id="e159">A Study of Han Yu's Letters to Great Master Dian <a href="#e159" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c159" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">159</a></h3>
<p>— Zheng Guoyi</p>
<p>There have been many eminent monks throughout history, but Great Master Dian is uniquely remembered and discussed, remaining immortal to this day. The people of Chaozhou especially revere him, referring to him as the Patriarch with utmost respect. The reason for this is the influence of Han Yu's three letters. If Great Master Dian had not encountered Han Yu, this famous case would not exist, and he would have long since decayed like grass and trees. However, the authenticity of Han Yu's three letters to Great Master Dian has been a subject of much debate, with no definitive conclusion. Ouyang Yongshu took the phrase "If one is not attached, then the mountains and forests are as noisy and bustling as the city" to mean that only Han Yu could have expressed such a sentiment. Su Dongpo, on the other hand, believed that the three letters were falsely written by someone, with vulgar language that even Han Yu's servants would not use. Ouyang and Su were both great literary masters of their time, yet their views differed so greatly. Zhu Xi, however, stated that "Only the last of the three letters has passages that are truly ungrammatical, perhaps because the original text was lost, and the monks' recollections were inaccurate, resulting in omissions and errors. Ouyang Gong only considered the general idea, so he only took what was acceptable and did not dwell on what was questionable. Su Gong noticed what was questionable but could not discern the errors and directly condemned it as vulgar." Thus, he judged the last letter to be false, while the first two were indeed written by Han Yu. Among Ouyang, Su, and Zhu, only Dongpo explicitly rejected them, while Yongshu and Zhu Xi both believed that they undoubtedly came from Han Yu. The only point of contention was the last letter. If the first two letters were indeed written by Han Yu, why dwell on the authenticity of the third letter? When Yuan Gong (Dunyi) wrote a poem on the wall of the Great Master Dian Hall, he also wrote: "Retreating Zhi considers himself like Confucius, vehemently denouncing Buddhism and Taoism. Not knowing what Great Master Dian is like? Several letters cherished, even leaving behind clothing." He ridiculed Han Yu to the extreme. In essence, Han Yu and Great Master Dian were friends, and Han Yu had already given him his heart. To quibble about the three letters is unnecessary. It was once said: "Han Yu criticized Buddhism, and Song Xu also criticized Buddhism, but monks feared Han Yu more than Song scholars, because Han Yu had not studied Buddhism deeply, his criticisms only scratched the surface, making them easily understood by the world. Song scholars, on the other hand, delved deeply into Buddhist scriptures, their criticisms reaching the essence, which not everyone could understand. Han Yu's criticisms were only directed at the Buddhist practices of the monks, so monks feared Han Yu more than Song scholars." This statement gets to the heart of the matter. Reading Han Yu's "Yuan Dao" (On the Origin of the Way) makes this clear. Han Yu, who had never studied Buddhism, suddenly encountered Great Master Dian on a desolate seashore, who eloquently discussed profound and subtle matters with him, Han Yu could not help but develop a sense of admiration and trust. Otherwise, how could there have been the acts of "building a hut" and "leaving behind clothing"? The acts of "building a hut" and "leaving behind clothing" are not something Han Yu himself denies. The existence of the three letters is of minor importance.</p>
<h3 id="e160">One Step Further <a href="#e160" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c160" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">160</a></h3>
<p>— Wang Baili</p>
<p>Suiyuan Shihua states: "Immortals are a beautiful title, but an ancient poem says: 'A husband's life is short, unfortunately becoming an immortal.'" Willow catkins are a drifting object, but an ancient poem says: "I am more adrift than willow catkins, willow catkins are only busy for one spring." This is what is meant by taking it one step further. Lao Xue'an's Notes record that Yan Jingchu, a minister, invited a monk to reside in a temple. The monk complained that the temple was too poor and humble. Jingchu said, "Talent makes things easy." The monk said, "How can a skilled woman make soup noodles without flour?" Jingchu said, "With flour, even a clumsy woman can handle it." The monk was ashamed and withdrew. I believe Jingchu's words also take it one step further.</p>

<p>— Tong</p>
<p>The silver scales of the menhaden, a type of herring found in the Finte Bay, are a surprising byproduct of the fishing industry. Surprisingly, these trivial scales are worth ten times the price of the menhaden and herring themselves.</p>
<p>Fishermen, exposed to wind and sun, are able to profit handsomely as manufacturers drive up the price and aggressively purchase the fish scales. It turns out that fish scales can be used to make pearl essence, the sole raw material for artificial jewelry.</p>
