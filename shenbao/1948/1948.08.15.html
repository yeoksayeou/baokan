<p>今日何日？今日爲日本無條件投降三週年紀念日，亦為日本正式接受波茨坦宣言之日。以一九四五年八月十五日這一天爲境界綫，人類有史以來最悲慘的第二次世界大戰，開始宣告終結。世界每一角落的人們，在歡欣鼓舞中重燃起新的希望，期待着殘酷的戰爭悲劇從此不再重演，永久和平的希望從此可以獲致。這個希望，在飽嘗侵略迫害的中國人民，自然特別殷切，即使在日本，除了少數軍閥財閥餘孽外，佔百分之九十以上的日本人民，也一定追求着光明的希望，祈禱着日本國家能從此獲致眞正的和平民主與幸福。</p>
<p>日本連續十四年的侵略戰爭，從九一八東北事變起，便注定了她失敗的命運，所以說日本的戰敗，不是偶然而是必然的。一九四三年七月，總國在東西兩綫軍事受挫後，日本即要求德國與蘇聯媾和，她並向蘇聯表示顧退出遠東戰爭，請求代向中美各國斡旋。德國戰敗無條件投降後，日本不斷向蘇聯作和平試探，一直到一九四五年八月四日美國第一顆原子彈投到了廣島，八月八日蘇聯向日本正式宣戰，日本纔中止了和平試探，準備作困獸之鬥。八月十日，美國原子彈又襲擊了長崎，東京發生空前混亂，日本政府和最高統帥部認戰爭末日已至，乃於當日下午八時三十分向全此界宣佈：一日本已決定接受波茨坦宣言」；接着日本分別將降書託瑞士政府轉交中美，託瑞典政府轉交英蘇。十一日下午，美國務卿貝爾納斯代表四國政府，以覆文一件送交瑞士駐美公使館託轉日本，覆文中規定投降方案。十四日中午，日皇在宮中召開最後的御前會議，昭和聲淚俱下作了最後決議，完全接受波茨坦宣言和貝爾納斯的投降方案，僅要求保留日皇問題一項。十五日中午，昭和向日本軍民廣播投降敕書，從這刻起，軍人放下軍刀，工廠停工，準備投降條款的簽定，盟軍佔領軍的降臨。</p>
<p>盟軍進佔日本，時爲八月廿八日；日本的降書簽字，時在九月二日。盟軍進佔日本以後，以麥克阿瑟爲統帥，並代表遠東委員會十一國，監督執行管制日本事項。盟國對日管制的根本原則，以波茨坦宣言作基礎，槪括起來，約分六點：（一）祛除軍國主義思想，以建設日本國內新秩序；（二）武裝兵力之解散及復員；（三）懲罰戰犯；（四）確立基本人權，恢復言論思想及宗敎自由；（五）維持最低限度之經濟水準；（六）政治澈底民主化。至盟軍之佔領管制，至上述各目的完成時爲止。按波茨坦宣言，爲中美英三國同意所發的對日文告，波茨坦宣言的精神，是神聖偉本的；波茨坦宣言的規定，是正確無比的。波茨坦宣言約東日本各規定事項，從一九四五年八月十五日起，發生事實上法律上的效力。至少在對日和約締結前，波茨坦宣言規定事項應該是不可變遷的。</p>
<p>可是三年以來，波茨坦宣言的神聖規定，是否能澈底的實現？日本軍國主義的思想，是否已完全祛除？日本人民是否眞正獲得了民主自由？日本的戰爭體制，又是否完全消滅？一句話說完，投降三年的日本，在政治經濟文化社會諸方面，並沒有眞正實現彼茨坦宣言的神聖規定，而且若干事實表現，同波茨坦宣言規定事項或竟有了顯著的距離。且看新憲法下的吉田·片山·蘆田內閣，他們執政以來，並沒有給日本人民創造民主，這不是對新憲法的一種諷刺嗎？財閥解散固然實行了，可是股權從未加以整理，而旦事實上對「工商金融界百分之八十，遙搖控制」着的，不仍是日本的財閥嗎？農田制度有了幾度的改革，可是除了地主和自耕農的擴張土地所有外，佃農能購買土地的，連一個也沒有。即以「經濟復興五年計劃」來說，其規定的工鑛業生產量遠過於一九三〇—三四年水準，但其規定的國民生活水準則在此基準年度之下，其並非爲解除日本人民的生活苦痛，乃是很顯著的事。總之，三年來管制日本的措施，以及日本政府對於投降條款的履行，結果與效率是相反的，事實說明日本正在重新走上復興的大路。這條復興道路，並非日本人民要求的生活與文化的復興，而是日本軍國主義的逐漸復興。這對於中國和世界的威脅，是何等的重大啊！</p>
<p>八月十五日，是人類歷史値得紀念之一日。我們在今天，蒿目時艱，感慨萬千。三年以來，除了前被日本併吞的韓國，總算能在今天正式成立獨立國家的政府，被日本割佔的臺灣復歸中華祖國而外，我們實在看不見日本內部究有多大實質的變遷。但是我們依然相信美國故總統羅斯福的名言：「我們的戰爭是探求永久和平，持久的和平，在結東戰爭以外，我們更要結束一切戰爭的萌芽。」我們更相信中日兩國人民的要求和目的是一致的，日本軍國主義的抬頭，爲中日兩國人民所同聲反對的。我們紀念日本投降三週年，願喚起盟國的警覺，正視波茨坦宣言的神聖精神，從速召開對日和會；澈底淸算日本間題，依和約規定，共同扶植日本走向眞正和平民主的大道。這便是我們今天最大的希望。</p>

<h3>印度獨立一週年</h3>
<p>— （本報資料室編）</p>
<p>去年今（八月十五）日印度正式獲得了獨立自由，英國一百餘年的統治，至此宣告終結</p>
<p>回憶這獨立一年來的史實，我們可以看出，新政府所遭逢到的困難是非常的多，苜先是獨立後不久，在印度和巴基斯坦邊境所發生的大規模洗血衝突，這不但破壞了那一帶的社會經濟，而且造成了成百萬洗離失所的難民，使新政府遇到極大的困難。此外，飢荒又普遍威脅着印度全國，這一方面是由於分治辦法將主要的糧食生產地區劃出了印度，另一方面是由於過去執政者的短視政策，所造成週期性的饑饉。這兩件事情，如果處理不當，都可能爲影響到新國家的前途的</p>
<p>今天，印度已可以驕傲地說，它已克服了上面的兩大難題，它的獨立自由的前途，絲毫未受威脅，難民已妥爲安置並復業，旁遮普省的社會經濟亦已重建，印度與巴基斯坦間的極種問題，經過幾個月來耐心的會議商討，已大體宣告解決，兩國關係的前途，比獨立初時的情形已光明了不知多少倍，饑荒的危機亦已克服了，而且近六年來第一次地，印度已可計劃糧食的剩餘？</p>
<p>此外，還有一個威脅着印度生存的更危險的因素，就是內部過激份子的陰謀。他們反對印度新社會那種不分階級，不分信仰，宗敎平等與自由的崇高思想，蓄意破壞，一月三十日甘地的被刺，就是這種陰謀的高潮。結果，由於政府嚴正的處理，寬大的胸懷，並發動羣衆輿論的制裁，陰謀叛亂的份子終被壓平。</p>
<p>歸附的王國</p>
<p>獨立以後，有六百多個王國，佔有五十萬方哩土地，七千五百萬人民，已自動歸附入印度版圖。這許多王國過去並不是英領印度的一部份，他們各自為獨立的政治單元，僅以條約關係，在政治上受英國的牽制。其中如梅沙爾王國，擁有八百萬人口，答拉文高王國，也有六百萬人口，都有現代化的工業和高度的行政效率，在王國中是很重要的。其他則比較小些，這許多王國，分散在各地，在經濟·國防和交通上，與印度唇齒相依，印度獨立以後，他們都先後來歸，現除海德里巴王國外，其餘皆已將政權移交給隣近的省份。從此，印度新政府的權力，已擴充到北起喜馬拉雅山，南至開慕林海角，使新生的印度，增加了很大的信心。</p>
<p>社會的改革</p>
<p>新生的印度，在社會改革方面，也努力地進行着，各種族，各階級不相往來的傳統觀念消除了，婦女在社會上地位的提高，也由法律加以確定。古老的印度法律，在英國統治時代所未曾作任何修正的，現已重加審愼研究，另一部份新印度的法典，業已起草，且已付諸立法程序之中了。</p>
<p>產業的開發</p>
<p>在過去一年中，產業的開發，工業化計劃的進行，雖在主要工具缺乏的情况下，仍有很好的成績表現。四處水力發電灌溉工程，先後開工了，使廣大的土地，獲得灌溉之利，同時有大量的電力，供工業上應用。其中以達莫大河谷的工程爲最大，完全仿照美國TVA設計的，將使貝哈省面目完全改觀。今年三月中，印度建造的第一艘船下水了，鐵路機車，也開始自己建造。許多基本工業，都在計劃進行中，大規模的鋼鐵工業，也由政府擬訂了計劃。工業技術人員的培養和工業化計劃相輔地進行着，過去曾辦了四所高級技術人員訓練所，並設立了科學研究部，直接有內閣總理的監督和指揮，展開大規模的研究工作，並負責科學和技術上的指導和合作事宜。</p>
<p>今後的前途</p>
<p>以上是光明一面的景象，但在另一面，印度也還有若千困難在前面，如海德里巴王國的迄未同意歸附，以及喀什米爾問題未獲解決，喀什米爾的爭端，已提交了安全理事會，但尙無解決之望，所以軍事行動也仍在繼續中。</p>
<p>雖有這種種困難，但印度在過去一年間的成就，確極輝煌，它已鞏固了自己的國際地位，它的貨幣甚爲穩定，尤其是，新的印度已向全世界顯示了，它不但珍重自已所辛苦得來的獨立自由，並有決心，也有力量來維護這份獨立與自由。</p>

<h3>為蘇抗議蘇教師被綁案　美蘇間愈形不歡　國務院對蘇指責已予以駁斥</h3>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓十三日電〕美蘇兩國十三日對蘇聯兩敎員案在外交上互相指斥對方。該二敎員深恐回國之後將有生命之憂，二人現似均能獲得在美避難之許可。國務部頃公開駁斥蘇外長莫洛托夫所稱美政府「默許綁架」高遜基娜夫人及桑馬林。國務部並間接而堅決拒絕莫氏所提「釋放」二人返蘇之要求。</p>
<p>該部發言人麥克竇莫德重申國務卿馬歇爾數日前之談話，即保護不敢返國之政治犯，乃美國之旣定政策。蘇聯大使潘友新本週內已向國務部提出二次口頭抗議，頃要求並被准於十三日會見副國務卿羅維特，但蘇聯大使館最後又取消此約，諒因高夫人一案發展迅速所致。據麥氏談稱，渠不能特別說明高桑二人是否將被准留居美國，因國務部對該案尙未接獲官方報告。在私人方面，美外交官員相信該案已使莫洛托夫處於極爲困惱之地位。彼等談稱，莫氏於十二日晚發表憤怒抨擊時，顯未獲悉高夫人已自紐約蘇領事館墜樓，而破壞蘇聯方面送渠返國之企圖，高夫人深恐一且返國，落入彼等掌握，必有性命之憂。國務部之「美國之音」電台於十三日正向全世界廣播此事。</p>
<h3>國務部顧問　飛紐約調查</h3>
<p>〔合衆社紐約十三日電〕國務部法律顧問葛羅斯，已自華府飛抵此間，與當地一切司法機構會議，並立即重申國務部之規定謂領事館官員之外交特權，並非意即刑事罪亦不受懲處之謂。葛氏復稱：「但在警方報告內，是否可查以罪行，尙爲假設之問題。鑒於蘇聯之抗議，余目前亦不欲討論此點」。渠與紐約市警察局之高級官員，聯邦調查局之人良，以及聯邦與紐約州之區檢察官會議幾達一小時之久。葛氏强調稱，國務部並不參加高夫人自蘇聯領事館特別逃脫一事之調查，「此非國務部之任務，但在答覆蘇聯抗議及再與蘇聯政府討論中，當地司法機構所收集之資料將加以考慮」。</p>
<p>〔中央社紐約十三日合衆電〕國務院法律顧問葛羅斯稱領事官雖享有外交豁免權，但如有犯罪行爲，仍應予罰辦。高夫人係自蘇領館三樓跳窗逃出者，鏡頭至爲驚險。歐維葉已命警察將調查高夫人自領館逃出經過之結果，作成報告，送呈司法當局。高夫人被拘事，如證明確實，則蘇領館之犯罪即告成立。國務院方面稱：領事官之豁免權，與大使公使等所享受者不同。</p>
<h3>美蘇為間諜案造成摩擦　英外交界表憂慮　可能因此破壞四强談判</h3>
<p>〔合眾社倫敦十四日電〕西方外交家鑑於莫斯科方面辱罵之聲日烈，而懼紐約教師案，可能破壞克林姆宮四强談判之成功機會。觀察家指出，莫斯科討論已入危急階段，任何一重大國際事件，均可使柏林德國兩問題初步協議之一綫生機亦成泡影。此間西歐外交家特別關心所謂美國「最歇斯的利亞之間諜恐懼病」。某人士將高遜基娜事件與加拿大案比較，而指出處置上之異點：美國由國會作驚人性之聽取，而加拿大則由皇家委員會調查後，起訴·審訊並定獻某西方外交家稱：「現在是用冷靜理智的時候，如果有不需要神經質，不負責及無謂挑撥性行動的時候，那就是目前」。</p>
<h3>蘇聯總領事　曾拘押高夫人</h3>
<p>美方可能提出公訴</p>
<p>〔中央社紐約十三日合衆電〕自高遜基娜夫人控訴伊曾爲蘇總領事拘押六日後，紐約市長歐維葉今表示，美方即將爲此提起公訴，國務院亦將直接予以干涉。</p>
<p>〔中央社紐約十四日電〕捨命跳樓使美蘇關係更引緊張之蘇籍敎員高遜基娜夫人，聞已向警局聲明，伊不特被禁於蘇領館內，蘇駐美大使且親來面晤，據紐約時報稱，高遜基娜夫人對紐約警察當局提出聲明稱，蘇駐美大使潘友新，曾來領事館，並欲自伊處獲得承認其並未被拘禁之證據，聞聲明內，並說明潘友新雖私人提出諾言，使伊將來不受蘇方懲罰，伊仍拒絕在上述證據上簽字。</p>
<h3>美調查委會　票傳高夫人</h3>
<p>〔合眾社華盛頓十三日電〕非美活動委員會調查主任史屈布林，將於今晚赴紐約，傳訊自蘇聯總領事館內跳窗跌傷之蘇聯女敎師高遜基娜。史屈布林稱，非美活動委員會欲聽取高遜基娜所必須說出之任何共黨控制世界的計劇。</p>
<p>〔合衆社紐約十三電〕衆院非美活動委員會，十三日向高遜基娜夫人發出傳票，該會主任調查員史屈里潑林，於十三日子夜携帶傳票離華盛頓，指令高夫人「在可能後立即」向國會間諜偵查機構作證，渠計劃在十四日晨將傳票交付高夫人。據十三日晨的報告，高遜基娜夫人仍在「危險狀態」下，靜臥於羅斯福醫院一間禁衛森嚴的病室中。</p>
<h3>蘇聯副領事　會晤高夫人</h3>
<p>惟拒絕會見蘇總領事</p>
<p>〔合衆社紐約十三日電〕十二日蘇聯領事館四樓窗口隊樓之蘇聯女敎師高遜基娜夫人，十三指斥蘇聯人員將其監禁達六日之久。當蘇聯副領事吉波危克於十三日晨進人高夫人之病房時，高夫人告以「汝將余監禁，並將不放余他去。」渠拒絕會見蘇聯總領事洛茂金。當吉氏在病房內之際大部份時間中，高夫人緊閉雙目。在開雙目時，高夫人亦未向吉氏注視。警員刻在羅斯福醫院四週戒備森嚴，以預防可能加害高夫人生命之企圖。</p>
<h3>聯合國檔案　馬卿拒絕調查</h3>
<p>〔美國新聞處華盛頓十三日電〕馬歇爾國務卿已拒絕准許參院小組會調查聯合國以及其它在美國際機構代表之機密護照檔案。馬歇爾之立塲，係在致參院小組會生席李佛康（西佛琴尼亞州共和黨參議員）之函件中加以說明。按該小組之任務，係在確定是否有外國秘密活動份子在聯合國服務之名義下進入美國。此項函件之發出日期爲八月七日，而由國務院於本日加以公佈。國務卿指出「檔案中有許多材料係由吾國駐國外外交機關自機密方面獲得者，故必須保持其機密性。」</p>
<h3>印度獨立一週年　尼赫魯呼籲和平　希望國際合作實現大同理想</h3>
<p>〔合衆社新德里十四日電〕尼赫魯總理十四日在印度獨立一屬年內，第一次單獨接見記者。渠對合衆社記者稱，除非世界能發展成全球聯邦，而英·美·蘇及其他國家同意在此一聯邦內共同生存，則世界將面臨自殺的危機。尼赫魯要求大國爲解決爭端而竭誠努力，不應互作譴責對方的企圖。雖然他相信第三次世界大戰的危機，最近已多少减輕了些，但是火藥桶則依然存在，因爲英·美·蘇三國仍未作解決歧點的眞正努力。</p>
<p>他說：「在美蘇之間，不但有不協調的情形出現，而且他們還希望製造不協調。雙方都處心積慮地使對方感到不快，所以第一步必須做到的，還無寗是雙方對協議的願望，這一種願望雖不一定能達成協議，但至少是向前跨了一大步。相當形式的世界政府，必須在我們這一代或下一代中出現，否則世界即將趨於自殺之途。它的形式和如何建立的問題，現在還很難說，但它必須在人民的信譽間生長」。尼赫魯對世界政府的形式，發表他的意見，他認爲世界政府必須是鬆弛的聯邦制，不僅建築在立法的基礎上，而必須以人民思想的心理改變爲基礎。</p>
<p>印前途漸露光明</p>
<p>在檢討印度獨立的一周年中，尼赫魯稱，雖然印度會爲移民問題而發生爭特，但其前途殊屬光明。他承認：印度正因通貨膨脹，而處於不穩的經濟狀况下，但他說，政府已採取若干措施，以挽救經濟危機。</p>
<p>贊同美對日政策</p>
<p>尼赫魯對美國重建日本經濟的政策，表示贊同，他說：「究全壓制係日本這樣的一洇民族是不智的，在民主基礎上復興日本，是准一可取的正確政策，但必須採取防止日本重整軍國主義的適當保障。他認爲目前亞洲共產黨活動的烽起，是由於經濟的條件，這種經濟條件必須加以救治。他說：「對付共產主義最重要的方法，就是改進經濟環境。</p>
<p>關於海地拉巴和克什威爾問題，他說：「倘若海地拉巴堅持已見，則印度的獨立將成爲一種笑柄，整偶南部印度將進入危險之中。」尼赫魯表示他對聯合國調解印度與巴基斯坦方法的不滿，他說：「要瞭解克什米爾的情形，必須瞭解一個基本事實，這是來自巴基斯坦的外來侵略。」</p>
<h3>三國專使接獲新訓令　再約晤莫洛托夫　羅勃森奉召返英備咨詢</h3>
<p>〔中央社柏材十三日電」英駐德軍事總督羅勃森將軍·美總督海思·與法副總督諾人勒，今日突應召先後前往倫敦</p>
<p>以備關於柏林危機與目前蘇京會談之諮詢。</p>
<p>〔合衆社倫教十四日電〕此問報紙今日暗示，莫斯科僵局可能打開，此消息與英駐德軍事總督羅柏森之返抵倫敦事同時刊載。羅氏十四日與外相貝文·外次史屈朗會議，供給德國局勢之資料以佐莫斯科談話之舉行。</p>
<p>莫斯科來電，據可靠消息西方使節業獲新訓令，包括下次會見莫洛托夫時提出之條款等。又悉，三使節在美使館會商循例起草備忘錄，一俟竣事即將要求蘇外部決定與莫氏會見之時間，可能爲十四日晚或十五日。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社倫敦十三日電〕英外交部德國事務司長史屈朗·美駐英大使陶格拉斯·法駐英大使馬西格里所組成之三國委員會，今日下午曾開會討論英專使羅伯茲發來關於最近一次與蘇外長莫洛托夫會談之報告書。英外交部對於莫斯科之談話消息仍嚴守秘密，有資格之各方面皆否認美國報紙所暗示英國現將無條件接受蘇聯參加西德行政之驚人消息，彼等指出此項消息實際僅將倫敦協議本身所言改爲驚人方式而已。要知西德政治機構之門戶大啓，隨時可容蘇聯加入，惟東區之行政亦須符合西方所公認之民主原則。至於蘇聯參與魯爾區之管制，英國於蘇聯長此拒絕西方列强參與蘇佔區之各項工業，並拒絕西方列强續享一九二一年多瑙河公約所規定共管該河航行之權利時，必將審愼考盧。觀於蘇代表維辛斯基在多瑙河會議中所取之態度，蘇聯之參加魯爾區管制已成甚大之疑問矣。</p>
<h3>德要求拒絕蘇幣　在西德流通</h3>
<p>〔合衆社柏林十三日電〕德國非共產三大政黨，即社會民主然·基督民主黨·與自由民主黨，今日會同反蘇之工會執委會向西區三國軍政府提出備忘錄，要求西方國家拒絕承認蘇聯所發行之馬克爲柏林唯一合法通貨，並要求立刻宣佈西方馬克爲西方部份之唯一貨幣。彼等又力促將西柏林及西方佔區之經濟打成一片。</p>
<h3>羅版圖併入蘇聯　羅駐英使館否認</h3>
<p>〔中央社倫敦十三日電〕此問羅馬尼亞公使館正式否認英國前所盛傳置國不久將併人蘇聯一說。羅公使館對於首先廣播此消息之安加拉電台，深表不滿，認爲此事有意侮辱羅國人民尊嚴之舉動。</p>
<h3>蘇陸軍重提要求　美英法退出柏林　蘇聯人員撤離四國司令部</h3>
<p>〔合衆社柏林十四日電〕蘇聯陸軍十四日又重提要求，公開令西方國家自柏林撤退，其理由爲蘇聯旣保證供應全柏林之食糧，西方國家實無繼續留駐之必要。蘇軍政府又稱，蘇聯並將以脂肪供應柏林全市。向蘇聯登記之報紙一致頌揚蘇聯舉措，並譽之爲將西方國家在柏林樹立之根基全部推翻。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社柏林十三日電〕蘇聯軍政府當局今晨已完全撤退駐美佔區四國司令部之人員，司令部屋頂每日同時懸掛之四國國旗，今日已爲三國矣。蘇聯衛軍亦已於數日前携帶全部文件撤離，然辦公室內之列寗與史達林肖像則忘訊帶走。目前在柏林尙由四國共同參加之機構，僅有四國管制會之秘書處，航空安全局，斯巴道監獄，及中央電話局。</p>
<h3>多瑙委員會組織　濱河國為限　美修正案遭否决</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社貝爾格勒十三日電〕多瑙河大會今晨開會時，以七票對三票（英美法）通過蘇聯方案中所規定將來多瑙河委員會之組織，以多瑙河諸國爲限之條文，大會並以七票對二票通過關於技術之若干條文。各款涉及建立羅蘇與羅南特別管理處，管理經過羅馬利亞或南斯拉夫之多瑙河支流。大會又以七票對一票（美國）通過修正案，規定建立多瑙河經過捷匈部分之支洗特別管理處。大會最後以七票對三票否決美國所提之修正案。即主張减小此種特別管理處之權力者。</p>
<h3>共情局預言　狄托遲早必垮台</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕倫敦十四日廣播：共產國際情報局發表公報，預言南斯拉夫總理狄托及其幕僚遲早將被取消南國共產黨領袖之資格猶抗議那特倫水站被毀</p>
<h3>聖地全面戰爭　隨時可爆發</h3>
<p>猶抗議那特倫水站被毀</p>
<p>〔合衆社台拉維夫十四日電〕以色列官方十四日靜候安理會對阿拉伯人破壞那特倫水站之反響，然此間官員以爲聯合國不致斥此舉爲破壞停戰令。阿人之炸毀抽水站，使聯合國調人貝那多特伯爵之聲望降至最低潮。以色列報章直率勸渠「收拾行裝好歸去也。」外交部則相信聯合國將稍作「挽救面子之行動」，而不致斥阿人爲侵略者。同時，以政府業已籌備猶阿之爭之第五階段——消耗戰。故兩方對陣軍隊，隨時均可恢復全面戰爭。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社台拉維夫十三日電〕以色列外長薛托克，已向安理會提出抗議，指責貝那多特溺責，最要之一點，爲貝氏不能保障耶路撒冷食水之供給及使那特倫之自來水站爲阿拉伯人炸毀。</p>

<h3>參會臨時大會決定　核減公用新價辦法　照七月份指數所增之五成一律取銷　此後價格組公開性調查審議會核定</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕本市第一屆參議會，目卅五年八一三滬戰紀念日成立以來，昨爲討論核减公用事業價格問題，特召開第一次臨時大會。會議於三時四十五分始舉行，共到參議員一百六十餘人，吳市長，公用局趙局長，及市府其他各關係同處負責人列席者頗衆。首由主席潘議長報告，此次召開臨時大會之任務，同時提供討論之意見兩點：（一）如何在兼顧市民負擔及維持公用事業繼續工作之前提下，臨定一會舉之價格。（二）本次臨時大會，時間偏促，故請先研究八月份之新價如何核减，對九月份以後之價格如何調整，提出合理計算辦法。又今日市長交議案一件，爲請組織公用事業公開調查審議委員會，審查本市各項公用事業實際必需支出，俾能確定調整價格方式，以資遵循案，亦一併提出討論。</p>
<p>繼由參會公用委員會召集人之一隻豪，代表報告公用委員會及小組會迭次召開會議經過及由李文杰作棧響上之補充報告後，繼由奧市長對渠之交議案，作一報告。渠指出特別維護公用事業之理由三點：（一）公用事業之利潤受限制。（二）不能囤積居奇或拒售。（三）不能一面售貨，一面收錢。已調整之價格，如歡樓减，祇需具下列三條件之一，亦可辦到：（一）如查出各公用事業之脹表中，有盧報而可核减之賬目者。（二）有補貼之辦法者。（三）有貸款之可能者。渠稱：二年來與參會諸君患難與共，尙宋遭遏如此離題，故提議請組織公用事業公開調查審議委會，公開審議有關公用事業之各項問題。</p>
<p>五時廿五分，討論正式開始。參議員馬君碩，張中原，費樹聲，邵永生，金潤庠，范錫品，姜懷素，王劍錫，虞舜，王維骃，嚴諤聲，何成甫，周辱汀，江浩然，朱文德，瞿鉞，楊撫生等，紛紛提出口頭或書面意見。迄八時許，乃由主席歸納各參議員之意見如次：</p>
<p>歸納意見　對於本市各種公用事業八月份調整新價如何核减及九月份以後應採何種標準，核實計算其價格一案，業經本會公用委員會提出審查報告，同時市長亦另有交議案一件，一併提經大會討論。查對於八月份公用事業調整新價核减辦法，如照公用委員會審查意見實施一律照最低價收費，大戶所用電燈電話煤氣等固可獲得核减之效果，小用戶及工業用電，仍未受到實惠。自來水及交通工具，性質迥異，硬性規定照七月份價漲740％，亦尙待斟酌。且聆取市長報告後，新價如經核减，各公司目前或有頭寸短缺之現象，各公司固應自負責任，但本會爲使各項公用事業能繼續供應市民享用，無處匱乏起見，似亦應作一緊急之協助措施。至九月份以後每月公用事業價格計算暫行標準，依照公用委員會審查意見內容，自頗詳盡。但若須付諸實施，仍應另有專任研究審議之機構，繼續其未竟之工作。</p>
<p>決議三項　綜上所述，爲求八月份之新價公允核减，九月份以後能獲得更合理之核價辦法起見，特決議如次：</p>
<p>（一）八月份公用箏業調整新價核减辦法：</p>
<p>一·水電煤氣部份：將此次核算八月份新價時，公式中凡採用生活費指數，外匯指數，及五金指數照七月份實際指數所增之50％部份，一律取消，重行核算减低。凡各用戶應行核减之帳款，未收者不收，已收者退還。</p>
<p>二·交通工具（電話除外）部份：八月份自十八日起，一律照新價减少20％—30％，每種票價，依此調整，至「萬」之整數爲準。</p>
<p>三·電話部份：將此次核算八月份新價時公式中凡採用生活費指數，外匯指數，及五金指歡，照七月份變際指數所增之50％，及所謂補價差額額之指數，一律取消，重行核算减低。各用戶核减之帳款，未收者不收，已收者退還。</p>
<p>四·各公用事業公司因八月份價格核减，而或致頭寸短缺，所需借款，除各公司董事會應負實調度外，由市府會同本會派員組織請願團，向中央請求貸借，</p>
<p>（二）九月份起，以後每月公用事業價格計算實行標準：</p>
<p>一·公用委員會最後修正印發之審查意見第一至第五項，全部通過。惟第六項將審查意見及李參議員文杰之意見，併送市府公用事業公開調查審議委員會研討決定之。</p>
<p>二·電燈電話分等收費之棵準，應依照本市實際情况修正，以符社會化定價之眞諦。</p>
<p>三·電氣煤氣及自來水等供應時期與付款所屬時期之適應問題，應予合理規定。</p>
<p>以上三項，交此後組織之調查審頗委負會辦理。</p>
<p>（三）九月份起，以後對於本市各種公用事業價格之核定，由市政府邀同本會及本市有關之各法定公團代表及專家等，組織公開性質之調查審議委員會辦理之。驜委員會得向市政府調閱廳各公開有關之一切帳目及文件，各公開不得有任何藉口拒絕調閱。該委員會之組織辦法，由市府另定之。至本會參加委員人選，授權購長副議長會同公用委員會推選，但不限於公用委員會之委負。該委員會核算九月份起之公用事業價格時，應參照本會公用委員會審查報告中所列舉之各項原則爲標準。</p>
<h3>海津輪上　累累黃金　走私破獲　價值估計達五千億</h3>
<p>江海關緝私課，於十一日接獲香港方面情報稱：招商局海津輪，由港來滬，輪上水手有私運鉅額黃金嫌疑，乃於十二日晚八時，調遣大批幹員，化裝逕赴招商局第一碼頭守候，即晚十一時十分，該輪進口靠埠，但候至十三日上午八時許，仍無所發現，乃決定採取行動，登論抄查達一小時，果於水手二頭目臥室內之一鐵櫃內，發見紙包一包，啓視則赫然係金條七十五根，估計價值當在五千億左右，惟因事機不密，該二頭目張某，已聞風潛逃，故未能拘捕。</p>
<h3>上半期指數　漲不到一倍</h3>
<p>今晨審議後發表</p>
<p>本月份上期生活指數，市府生活指數審議委員會，定今日上午十時在市府會議後發表。據有關方面推測，本月上期之工人生活指數，因配米及公用事業之價格，雖上漲率頗高，而一般雜糧，衣着，住屋，及肥皂，捲燜等日用品等上漲率，均較遲緩，故如根據以上各項之物價統計，則決不到上期指數之一倍云。</p>
<h3>市財政日益艱難　田永謙提兩辦法</h3>
<p>本市財政日益艱困，財政局長田永謙特於昨日市參議會臨時大會中提出書面報告，建議兩項辦法，（一）遵循正當途徑，請求中央作短時間之補助，並請參議會予以支持，轉呈中央迅予核准。（二）財局爲謀收入之調整，正由谷主管部門悉心研詩擬具方案，送會審議，如認爲可行，請隨時通過施行，另報大會追認，以便爭取時效。</p>

<p>旋至十一日直稅局又公布補充辦法，其中有一項稱，如按照上述八項標準裁汰後，仍有必需時，得按卅七年度一至六月之考績，再予裁遺，然該局此次裁員時，並未悉與前八項標準符合，被裁人員於十二日曾要求該局局長黃祖培對裁員事宜，予以公開處理，嚴格執行部頒辦法，黃局畏旋即晉京向財部請示，由部派國稅署人事處長趙佩豐，專委竇夢非於昨日來滬調查。被裁人員聯誼會曾於昨日上午推派代表晉見部方代表，當經兩代表答覆稱：公開審查不可能，至特考及格人員之復職，可予考慮。關於善後問題則稱不在此行職權範圍之內。最後即囑被裁人員代表搜集直稅局此次裁員不合理之資料，於今日提供參考，至明日再行公布處理辦法。</p>

<h3>頭號日戰犯岡村　調查庭訊問六點　定廿三日假市參議會公審</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕第一號日本戰犯前駐華派遣軍總司令岡村寗次大將正式公審之前，軍事法庭昨晨先開調查庭作初步訊問。岡村對於其部下所犯殺害我人民破壞我財產等罪行供稱不知，並不能負責，審畢還押江灣戰犯監獄，定二十三日假塘沽路市參議會公審，屆時將由江一平·錢隆生兩律師爲其辯護。</p>
<p>昨日上午八時許，軍事法庭派副官郭薪夫率同憲兵等至醫院中將岡村提出，九時正開庭。庭長石美瑜，軍法官張體坤，葉在增，書記官胡民鐸，翻譯官羅滌，首由張體坤軍法官調查岡村履歷。岡村穿灰色西裝，自襯衫，藍花領帶，黃皮鞋，因患肺疾朱瘉，精神頗現委頓，惟面色尙佳。據供：年六十五歲，東京人，陸軍大學畢業，順任關關東軍參謀副長，參謀本部簽二署長，陸軍中將第二師團員，第十一軍司令官，陸軍大將第六方面軍司令官等職。民國三十三年十二月升任爲中國派遣軍總司令，直至日本投降時爲止。</p>
<p>訊問六點一一答復　岡村供述履歷完畢後，休息數分鐘，石庭長即開始訊問，問詞前後共分下列各點：（一）担任駐華指揮官係奉令抑自意？（二）以大將地位曾參與大東亞戰爭最高軍事會議幾次？（三）担任總司令以前，岡村已在華作戰，對於日軍屠殺放火等行爲是否知悉？（四）作戰期間日軍二十七師團長落合甚九郎，一一六師團長菱田原四郎，六十四師團五十五旅少將旅團長梨岡壽男，長沙警備司令船引正之等所部殺人放火之罪行，岡村應否負責任？（五）日本投降時散佈中國之日軍共有多少？（六）日本海空軍是否亦由其負責？以上各點岡村供稱：（一）擔任駐華派遣軍最高指揮官係奉政府命令。（二）並未參與大東亞戰爭最高軍事會議。（三）關於日軍屠殺等種種事件均不知道，擔任總司令官後曾約東部下。（四）落合甚九郎師團等之罪行渠不能負責，因總司令官以下有方面管轄軍，方面軍之下又有軍司令部，師團由司令部管轄，與總司令部相隔兩級，故其罪行應由師團長負責。（五）日本投降時在華日軍確悉不知，大概在一百萬人以下。（六）一部份空軍受其指揮，海軍及海軍陸戰隊則自有系統。岡村除口頭答覆庭上訊問外，並當庭提呈答辯書一份，其內容大致分兩點：（一）起訴書內所列日軍屠殺中國百姓之罪行，其責任應由直屬長官師團長負責。（二）提出渠曾設法防止其部下加害我人民之種種證明。</p>
<p>答記者問面露苦笑　調查庭歷時約三刻鐘後宣告結束，岡村爲記者羣所包圍，紛紛提出問題，渠對於中國政府之寬大仁慈精神表示感激，並稱願以最火力量帮助中國政府。有人詢以今日受審有無怨意？岡村面露苦笑，思索有頃種答不出來，以前做師團長時曾研究佛學以安定心情，現在希望能平靜渡過二十三日公審之一天。渠認爲日本軍事復興絕對不可能，因日本在管制之下，其他國家之武器則日新月異。岡村並述其感想稱：渠願以過去在軍隊之經驗貢獻於中國，使中國軍事復興，此爲安定東亞之捷徑云。</p>
<p>據石芙瑜庭長告記者稱：對於岡村密次之審判決抱不報復不寬縱之態度。公審完畢後，將與承審各軍法官交換判決意見，以多數之意見爲最後決定，然後再呈請總統核准。</p>

<h3>牯嶺八月迎總統</h3>
<p>— 本報牯嶺九日航訊　特派員　劉問渠</p>
<p>八月牯嶺，還是那樣恬靜。氣溫徘徊在七八十度間，不冷也不熱，偶然的陣雨或濃霧過去後，更凉爽宜人山明水秀，泉林問徜徉着遊客輕鬆的步伐，看行雲流水，頗有飄然世外之感，市廛閒也沒有緊張的紛擾，似乎一切都在平和中渡過。</p>
<p>總統大婦沒有幸負牯嶺人士和廬山景物的期待，終於蒞臨了，在數千民衆自動列隊鼓掌歡迎聲中蒞臨了，這是總統第一次到牯一嶺啊！總統夫婦向歡迎民衆答禮時的笑容，給牯嶺人士無限安慰一，也留下了極深刻的印象，</p>
<p>侍從人員的飛機，於九日晨九點多鐘便降落在十里舖機塲了。由新街沿着大路走，不遠的地方，從山的缺口中便可看見機塲，但上午顯然沒有人注意。柳元麟副侍衛長帶着一些人悄悄上山來。中午，他們在卅九號（勵志社的房子）吃中飯，有人看見，便傳出來：「是總統來了。</p>
<p>最有力的證明，還是總統夫婦的乘輿。二時十五分，從官邸抬出的轎子，誰都會認識的，轎夫們穿着安安藍布的制服，一頂草帽，抬着經過最熱鬧的正街。第一乘是空的，過去之後，第二乘跟着過來，轎中還坐了一個人。仔細一看，原來是管理局長王作民，他是下蓮花洞去迎接的。轎子下山，有人在計算鐘點，看情形，五六點鐘可能到了。</p>
<p>由下午三時起，到八時止，街上的人愈來愈多。牯嶺人至少出動了一半，正街，新街，這兩條必經之路，被人們塞滿了。憲兵和警察用盡方法開出一條路，把人們攔在兩旁。人多容納不下，便沿着蓮牯大道延伸，一直延伸有將近一里長。延伸出去的人，有着意外的方便，從缺口可以望機塲，看「美齡號」起落，也可以看到對山的半山亭，和蜿蜓的山路上轎子行進的情形。</p>
<p>夕陽的反光，隱晦了「美齡號」的機身。六點半，「美齡號」降落在十里舖，遠看僅有二寸長一寸寬的機塲，不過上面着了一個黑點。估計時間，七時半應該可以到半山亭了。大衆的眼睛直望着對山，充份長現了期待的熱情。</p>
<p>遠山近林，在暮霞中益發顯得秀麗。驕陽失去威嚴，淸風徐來。等待着總統夫婦的蒞臨，似乎比遊山玩景，更有興趣。在期待中，太陽落到山背後去了，暮色漸深，拿着開麥拉的朋友不免嘆一口氣，而對山山腰中，依稀閃出幾頂山轎的踪影。看着他們行進，轉彎了，消失在山背後，不久，又出現了，過了半山亭，過了紀念碑，這不是到了天池口了嗎？總統夫婦現在正一步一步接近熟情期待中的的民衆了。每個人都可以自由地瞻仰元首夫婦的豐采。掌聲掩沒了一切。</p>
<p>從人的行列中穿過，一共是四乘。第一乘是夫人，她以以以微笑和揮手向民衆們答禮。第二乘是總統，他取下頭上的軟木帽，向民衆們打招呼，還不斷的頷首微笑。第三乘是俞濟時，第四乘是石祖德——據說登牯嶺時永遠是這樣的行列。一些侍衛人員是徒步跟隨的。總統的長班轎夫，每轎八名，稱得起健步如飛，當人們正欲仔細瞻仰一審時，肩輿却飛速地過去了，祇留下元首夫婦給與的微笑。</p>
<p>秩序相當好，掌聲一直不斷，而總統夫婦肩興還去後，歡迎的民衆依然列隊等候。八時廿分，總統夫婦通過正街，轉向河東路</p>
<p>黨總統夫婦踏入官邸後不久，繁皇從晴空中不斷眨眼，似乎也希望趕上看這塲熱鬧，夜幕展開，牯嶺回復了恬靜。</p>
<p>據說，總統夫婦這次到牯嶺來，主要的目的是避暑和休息，請想想吧，總統的肩上是多麼况重的一副想子，從準備到行憲，政治上的無數紛擾，從和談到戡亂，軍事上的若干順逆，宵旴辛勞，在這酷熱的盛夏，是應該有一個短時期的休息。聽說，總統準備在牯嶺休息兩星期，儘可能地减少政務的煩勞，傳說中的集會已經舉行過了，在牯嶺，將不致有過份繁重的事重累我們的元首。今天，當然是疲勞的，從明天起，廬山將靜靜地接受總統夫婦的欣賞。</p>

<h3>二十五萬票面關金劵明日起正式發行　央行負責人談現鈔恐慌可解除</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕廿五萬票面之關金券，決於明日發行。該項關金由中央印製廠承印，票面爲鮮紅色，與五元票面之關金類似。</p>
<p>據央行發行局某負責人表示：廿五萬票面之關金發行後，各地現鈔荒可告解除。近日來因物價上漲過述，國行雖有一萬。二萬五·及五萬元票面關金之發行，但市面之籌碼仍感缺乏，故國行應行莊之請求，將原定收兌之五千元票面之法幣拋出，以供市面之需要，實爲不得已之舉。廿五萬元之關金問世後，現鈔恐慌可告解除，五千元之小鈔即可大批收兌，以後不再洗通市面。</p>
<p>又訊：昨日銀根，由鬆轉穩，四行兩局一庫於銀錢兩業票據交換中，有大額差進，總計二〇七三億，就中中央銀行差進二八，九一四億，中國銀行差進二，七七二億，交通銀行差出五〇億，農民銀行差出一二七三二億，中信局差進四，二一四優，郵匯局差出二，七五二億，中央合作金庫差進八一八億　商業行莊大交換差出一一〇，三四六億，小交換差出三八，七〇〇億，外商銀行差進二八，三一五億。</p>
<p>又訊，昨日因値週末，又値月中，業內亟需，故現鈔緊勢重復惡化，市間貼水昂至十分之一。航帮求殷，較前爲甚。中央銀行對於同業款額，亦告减少，交換號次在五十號以前者，僅爲一百億至二百億，以後一律爲五十億。國家行局亦僅有三百至五百億。因之行莊不得不對客戶提現，重加嚴限。大致均准二千萬元，小行莊且有僅准五百萬元者。</p>
<h3>米價繼續激漲　門售叩七千萬大關　傳配米即將停止說不確</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕昨日本市米價繼續激漲，因外傳食糧將緊急收購，人心看好，市塲行情暴跳，門售市價已達七千萬大關。其他商品之批發價格，因和謠復傳，銀根略緊，及其他利空消息之影響，反全面下挫。棉布人造絲廠綢等，均下跌一成左右，紗及捲烟等物品行情尙穩定。惟昨日商品之批發價格與零售價格之間，似呈脫節現象，因月半生活指數行將發表，商店已先期紛紛提高門售價格，日用品之漲風，殊爲驚人</p>
<p>又訊：食米價格狂漲後，市塲又盛傳計口授糧亦將被迫停止，民調會主委吳國楨氏，特鄭重否認是說。並稱：本市民調會之配米，不論如何，均不致遭受米價之任何影響，因九十兩月之配米，早已籌備就緒，十一月份亦已籌備半數，故停止配米之說，絕對不確。</p>
<p>米市捷登高峯，因無錫報價之猛漲，人心激昂，引起貨主之竭力扳高，北市塲曾見上漲六七百萬元，收市轉低，特高粳達六千七百萬，其他粳米，已一致出六千萬大關，各漲一成。惟收市因業外各物下降，人心亦虛，收市喊低二百萬。南市塲早開挺五六百萬，收市化呆，喊低一二百萬元。昨日到貨，南北二市共六八四〇石。</p>
<p>麵粉</p>
<p>因小麥貨稀，上日廠盤高達二千四百萬，人心一致看高，早市老車以二千五百萬開出，後因開價過高而退後，收市更因業外各物報低而更虛，結果老車步退至二千三百四十萬收市，上落殊大。兵船收市二千二百七十萬，仍較上日漲一百一二十萬元，紅蜂·建成，各開二千三百萬。麩皮漲一百萬，小麥廠盤再升四百萬，以三千三百萬開出。</p>
<p>雜糧</p>
<p>繼續上漲，初市漲勢銳利，收市轉疲，黃豆油帮續有納取，早市挺升四五百萬，收市因油餅反挫，故回落二百萬。苞米靑島帮納取甚多，挺升五百萬，收市亦疲，元麥南北帮均取，升四百萬，芝蔴略昂一百萬，生仁廣帮不納，獨削二百萬。</p>
<p>食油</p>
<p>轉趨下游，因上日所漲過多，又因業外物價下降，消息靈敏者乘機出籠，散戶吐出，豆油初爲一六三〇〇萬，收市一五九〇〇萬，略降二百萬。生菜油亦稍挫一二百萬元，生油跌三百萬，吉桶生油一九五〇〇萬，小車蔴油初市平定，收市降五百萬。豆餅客帮不取，乏人問津，挫落三五十萬不等</p>
<h3>結匯證市價續升　飾金再漲二千萬</h3>
<p>昨日結匯證市價繼續猛升，晨開七二〇萬元，旋因進口商扒購頗烈，升達七八〇萬元，最後稍回至七六〇萬元。又銀樓飾金議價，因結匯證上升，又漲二千萬元，計兌進五億四千萬元，兌出五億八千萬元。</p>

<p>四行兩局一庫內匯率，將於十六日起修正如次：廈門三〇〇元，福州二五〇元，泉州汕頭各三〇〇元，展州三五〇元，長沙衡陽各二〇〇元，重慶三〇〇元，成都三五〇元，武漢各二〇〇元，平津一〇元，南昌·九江·各二五〇元，屯溪·歙縣，各二〇〇元，瀋陽一〇元，錦州二〇元，長春一〇元，承德二〇元，張家口三〇元，其他各地不變。</p>
<h3>呢絨向榮</h3>
<p>昨日週六，呢絨行市全部向榮，章　花呢售六千五百萬元，鴻祥花呢六千萬元，中紡一八三〇嗶嘰四千二百五十萬元，五〇〇九爲三千五百萬元，二九〇一大衣呢五千萬元，安樂莊大衣呢二千二百五十萬元，茶會上及諸大批發戶棋盤街帮，直接間接咸有成交。良以銀根鬆濫，拆患降低，本街及南京帮俱有開進，更受週三與週五，中紡各漲一成，人心轉堅，續看再好。</p>
<h3>多頭紛吐人心虛軟　棉·紗·漲·勢·稍·戢　布疋賣氣甚盛價亦疲挫</h3>
<p>昨日棉紗市况，因速朝狂漲人心踟躇，嗣以銀根轉緊，客帮納意趨淡，中紡續有拋售，籌碼寬裕，又値週六關係，多頭紛吐，塲內又有和談流言，人心頓虛。</p>
<p>四十二支藍鳳細紗，初盤即猛挫二億元，交易不甚熟鬧，後有複製業乘低略有吸納，價稍提上，終以卅二億三千萬現出，卅三億三千萬週一出結束，比上日疾退一億二千萬至七千萬元。其他各支粗細紗，亦都回降二三千萬至一成左右不等，成交七十五件。</p>
<p>昨日棉布市况，以隔日午後騰漲過度，引起賣風，又値紡建公司配售之期，現籌充沛，銀根轉緊，客帮以匯款未到，且拆款到期甚多，頭寸軋緊，北帮轉售不寂，本街廠家觀望鮮動，市量供過於求。</p>
<p>十二磅龍頭細，布晨開即告下降一百萬元，旋因客路津帮趁高吐售，浮多遭受壓迫，頻有了結，致場內費風四起。</p>
<p>十點半後市，盤再度下瀉二百八十萬元，迨近收時，散空抵補，回上至八千四百八十萬元收盤，較上日疾瀉三百二十萬元。</p>
<p>中檔貨之五福喇叭童陽鶴等，各跌三四百萬不一，此外惟色布及士林布步挺，其餘谷布脚地趨軟，成交一千七百六十疋。</p>
<p>又訊：午後市勢，因傅行局有差進，銀根甚緊，賣風未戢，龍頭細布喊價一升即降，結果與午收軋平，四君子元嗶嘰較午收微秀五十萬元，其餘相彷。</p>
<p>中紡爲配合國策，連日採取大量拋售政策，只要有人申購，便盡量供應，市塲漲勢，始告稍遏。昨日代紗管會拋紗二三八件，收回金額五〇，九九七，〇〇〇萬。又代行總配出一四四件，金額爲二八，八〇〇，〇〇〇萬。</p>
<p>又中紡昨日牌價售布一三，〇九〇疋，被單三五〇條，共收回法幣九五，七三三，〇〇〇萬。</p>
<h3>多方紛紛脫手　華股節節挫降</h3>
<p>華股昨日初疲後挫，緣以本月上期指數，行將發表，預卜甚高，傳新經濟方案有不利股市之說，銀根更緊，多方爲求安全起見，咸都脫手，遂致一蹶不振。</p>
<p>晨開永紗一六七七〇元，較昨開低二八〇元，人心散漫，散戶無意棧戀，一致放棄。二二八號六九號七六號八九號六五號來售降至一六五五〇元，嗣以二二〇號一二一號一三四號八三號等略有納胃，回升至一六九五〇元，多方見機脫手，證券帮售出不少，廣帮亦來襯託吐售，行市又退至一六五五〇元，雖有二九號四三號一〇一號二二八號援手維持，而回升至一六七〇〇元，無如環境不利，大戶空頭觀望不動，浮空亦有增無减，而華北游資减少，銀根更緊，一五五號一一六號四號六五號二二〇號一〇六號一〇二號五一號再來力售，乃急挫至一六〇〇〇元關內，中途雖有浮空逢低稍補，一度回升至一六六三〇元，惟曇花一現而已。近午港匯放長，圈外物價一致下降，本已虛軟之勢，何堪再受打擊，在四面楚歌之下，市形益疲，永紗終以一五九〇〇元結束，美亞開盤七〇〇元，雖高至七一五元，低見六四五元，新光景福等亦趨疲軟。結果較前收計永紗美亞信和新光景福火柴中絲華東商務閘北跌半成强及一成左右，除信誼藥廠獨升半成强外，餘均下挫。塲外各未上市股票，因搜求有人，普遍挺秀。</p>
<p>公債</p>
<p>因爲有和平傳說，更趨俏利，統丙晨開二一七萬元，雖一度曾回低二一〇萬，祗以求過於供，而五五〇室五〇三室五〇〇室三六〇室俱來哄納，再創二一二萬元高價，承德五五二室略有吐出，再以二二六萬結束，結果較前收計統丙猛升二〇萬元，戊種漲二五萬元，甲乙亦好起六萬元。</p>
<h3>存放款拆息提高</h3>

<p>〔合衆社倫敦十四日電〕第十四屆世界運動會今天閉幕，溫布萊運動塲上舉行傳統閉幕儀式，另有一種國際親善風味。五環世運會旗緩緩自竿顚降下，同時，世遝火焰熄滅。世運節目，一九五二年將再在芬蘭京城赫爾辛基出現。各國代表和擎旗人，以半圓形立於榮譽台後面，軍樂大作，會中三旗杆上，分別升旗，右邊先升希臘國旗，樂隊吹奏希臘國歌，紀念世運發源國家，中間升起英國國旗，全塲高唱「天佑吾王」。最後在左桿上升下屆世運地主芬蘭國旗，樂曲亦吹奏芬關國歌。國際世運委員會主席厄斯隆致詞，稱：「本人以國際世運委員會名義向英王和人民，及倫敦市當局，和籌備競賽者表示崇敬，余宣佈第十四屆世界運動會業已結束，並號召全世界靑年，四年後在赫爾辛基重聚。」世運會旗降下後，交與倫敦市長，四年後再轉交芬蘭，英王皇家馬隊喇叭手高奏驪曲，禮砲高鳴五下，歌咏隊細唱世運曲時，世運火炬熄了。擎旗者亦紛紛在樂聲中散去，暮色初上時，世運會已人去塲空。</p>

<h3>教局昨召開學費問題座談會　彙集意見擬訂方案　一致要求依照憲法提高教育經費</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕市教局昨日下午四時假育才中學舉行學費問題座談會，被邀出席之公私立中小學校長，教職員，家長及教育界人士共百餘人。會中發言熱烈，將由教局歸納各方意見擬訂下學期公私立中學收費之具體方案，提交下次會議討論後，彙報吳市長決定。</p>
<p>座談會意義　首由教局長李熙謀說明召開座談會之意養，認爲下學期學費問題相當嚴重，希望出席者商討時必須摒棄成見，在兼顧學校敎職員與家長各方之困難下，貢獻意見。李局長並報告根據敎局之統計，上學期收費標準私小爲二百萬元，初中爲三百六十萬至三百八十四萬，高中爲四百萬至四百八十萬，當時生活指數爲八萬另七百倍。現七月份下半月職員指數爲一百五十萬倍，如依此生活爲指數比例計算，則下學期私小應爲三千七百萬，初中七千一百四十萬，高中八千九百二十萬。但此一標準係依據七月份下半月指數計算，而非依各校開學時期之指數。李局長並報告私校收取雜費亦應限制，政府將仿效英國辦法，對經濟情形困難之私校，設法予以補助。</p>
<p>以實物作準　江問漁對收　費標準認爲可以實物作標準，或照戰前私校收費數字乘生活指數斟酌辦理。邰爽秋稱對收費標準有擬訂公式之必要，先計算一敎師五口之家之生活費應多少，以每班五十人計算，去百分之二十免費額及百分之二十行政費，敎師薪水以每月三祖米計算，則每一學生約收八斗米左右。邰氏並主張救濟特捐取之於上海豪富，至少應提取其中三分之一作補助上海學校尤其私校之用。</p>
<p>進修費問題　市小教職員代表要求下學期仍繼續征收敎師進修費。私立中學敎職員代表希望依民國二十五年之收費標準，按物價上從比例徵收學費，市中敎職員認爲不論公私立學校收費標準，應依據學校開支，敎師生活爲準則，由政府當局及學生家長分別負担。敎師待遇依廿六年上半年標準照物價指數計算。</p>
<p>向政府要錢　立委傳統先報告本年國家總預算中之敎育經費經力爭已增加四萬五千餘億，其中百分之三十爲國敎經費，百分之三十補助私校，百分之三十救濟綏靖區學生，百分之十補助功勛子弟遺屬。故地方政府可合法合理向中央爭取經費。傅氏認爲今日祗有向政要錢，敎育才有辦法。</p>
<p>家長顧樹森認爲敎師生活應使安定，不能因學費問題而减少彼等之待遇。收費標準亦應减至使一般家長均能負担。此外並一致要求將敎靑經費提高至憲法所規定之數。</p>
<h3>私專下期學雜費　白米三石半</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕本市各私立專科學校校長，昨日下午三時在香港路銀行俱樂部舉行座談會，出席無錫國專唐文冶·立信會專潘序倫·光夏商專王裕凱·上海美專劉海粟·中國新專陳高傭等十餘人，決議下學期本市各專科學校學雜費標準，一律白米三石半，按開學日報載之米價折合法幣繳納。至註册載止日爲止不變動。過期註册繳費，即按繳費日報載之米價拆算。</p>
<p>又本市各私立大學校長定本月二十四日集會商討下學期收費問題，據悉一般標準將爲白米四石</p>
<h3>東北學生代表　昨向教部情願</h3>
<p>唐司長允設法解決困難</p>
<p>〔本報南京十四日電〕東北學生請願團代表九人，爲生活及讀書問題，十四日上午十二時半到敎部請願，由高等敎育司唐司長培經答復，在原則方面：（一）對於東北內歸之家境淸寒確無經濟接濟之中等以上學校學生，當竭力解決其食住上之困難。（二）對東北內歸之純正而有學籍並在校讀書滿一學期以上之中等以上學校學生，當竭力依其程度，解決其讀書問題。</p>
<h3>教部挽留章益</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕復旦大學章益提出辭呈，該校各院系主任聞訊均簽請慰留。敎部亦已有覆電挽留，經費問題待以後商討解決。</p>
<h3>臺大解聘教授　代表過滬赴京</h3>

<h3>可以防止的天災</h3>
<p>— 孫嘉麟</p>
<p>此次寳山路永備內衣製造廠遭受「天打」，觸及馬達電綫，致肇走火鉅禍。關廠職工一百〇三人中，死者六十三，輕重傷者二十餘，老闆與老闆娘亦殉難。大家莫不同聲惋惜，嘆爲「飛來橫禍」。其實這橫禍之來，一半是咎由自取。「天」之所以要「打」永備內衣廠者，　是要　　他們的疏忽與無知！</p>
<p>高大的建築物和巨大的烟突必須裝置完備的避雷針；馬達等動力綫通過大量電洗必須裝有地綫；一切火綫概須絕緣完密，年久過限的應該拆換；都是並不高深的常識。該廠的建築師和工程師早應該注意實行。老闆出身學徒，未受高深敎育，普通常識或許缺乏。他們的疏忽和無知毀滅了自己，殺害了無辜的工友！</p>
<p>「天災」有時候竟就是「人禍」，是可以防止的，是可以設法减輕的。不要迷信「刧數」，更不要歸咎「命運」。永備廠如果裝有優良的避電針和絕緣極好的電綫，就不會發生一天打」和走電了。這近百條人命和數百億的資產損失，都是自白的犧牲！</p>
<p>寄語各工廠的管理人員，預防意外宜在平時刻刻注意；老闆們也別太愛惜錢而使陳舊的電綫繼續勉强應用，懲前毖後，亡羊補牢，以免意外。</p>
<h3>接猶太之芳鄰</h3>
<p>— 俞劍華</p>
<p>幼讀莎士比亞威尼斯商人，對於猶太人之狡黠險狠，已有極深之印象，其後又習聞猶太人種種惡德，於是理想中構成一幻象，以爲猶太人均係陰險卑劣，惟利是圖之輩。</p>
<p>勝利後自閩返滬，以友人之介，稅居於虹口提籃橋之長陽路，附近係猶太人聚居之所，近雖陸續遣送回美，然同寓同弄，猶太人尙屬不少。尤以弄內有咖啡館，及一私人小花國，尤爲猶太人消閑納凉之所，相習旣久，接觸頗多，漸覺猶太人絕不如傳聞之可憎。對於猶太人之內層生活，雖無法詳知，然從表面觀之，並無可非議之處，而其整潔健康，較　國人實屬遠過，多數人均態度大方，彬彬有禮，用錢亦頗慷爽，至於錙銖必較惟利是圖者，尙屬少見。</p>
<p>附近所居猶太人多爲自德國被希特拉驅逐而來，男多體格修偉，大有德人之風（間有短小者，想係別種），女則少年多爲苗條，中年以後，則肥碩不堪，甚至臃腫不靈，腰如五石之甕，男女衣履均極整潔精緻，質料高貴，女喜花衣，雖花田老人，鷄皮鶴髮，猶敷粉衣綵，艷麗如少年。其未結婚或結婚而未育子女者，多養一狗，出入相隨，十分珍視。及生子女，則狗不知何往。幼兒必置於極精美之兒車中，由父或母推之至花園中，絕未見有用手抱者。猶太幼兒圓潤白晳，宛如「洋囝囝」，極爲可愛，漸大漸差，及至十歲以後，則其頑皮，較中國見童有過之無不及。猶太人喜過戶外生活，家居不出者甚少，雖嚴冬酷夏，亦必出外，雖散步亦必快步急行，若有要事。附近猶太人雖亦有從事小規模之工商業者，然大多數均終日逍遙無事，雖物價高昂，而彼輩怡然自樂，毫未感經濟壓迫。據聞無職業者，由猶太聯合會津貼，每人每月美金十元，衣料一襲，食物一箱，此款係美國猶太人所捐助，故生活極爲優裕。至於回美國亦有專船運送，船上一切均係免費，現相繼回美者漸多，余所居之弄內，本全係猶太人，今已僅存半數。彼此之間，多用德語，對中國人多用英語，能中語者極少，因此附近商店，小菜塲，以及地攤收舊貨，修皮鞋之中國商人，無不諳簡單之英德語言。凡猶太人購物，價必較國人爲昂，視爲當然，是中國人之牟利手段殊不弱於猶太人。而余自幼養成輕視猶太人之觀念，已於無形中漸次改變矣。</p>
<h3>豪華監獄</h3>
<p>— 晉霖</p>
<p>司法界認爲紐約格林尼治村的監獄是全世界最舒服的監獄，其中的女監尤有「豪華監獄」之稱，因爲監裏的女犯比附近的窮村民過得更舒服。每一間監房裏都有冷熱水龍頭設備，並有巡廻圖書館，由看守推着滿載小說的車子分送到監房裏。該監並設有神台可轉動的禮拜堂一座，每逢做禮拜時，先做耶穌敎禮拜，然後一捺機鈕，神台轉動，即接做天主敎禮拜，再一轉，做猶太敎禮拜。監裏的犯人有絕對的信仰自由。</p>
<h3>栩綠老人遺聞</h3>
<p>— 陳左高</p>
<p>時序荏苒，榮悴相襲，栩緣老人西歸道山，奄忽已七易裘葛矣。每展畫幅，輒思其行誼靡置。老人諱同愈字勝之，又字文若，栩緣其別署也，隸籍江蘇元和，晚淸已丑翰林，書工四體，尤精大草小楷。所作山水，規撫宋元，悉心布局，識者罔不折服。初客吳愙齋第，盡覽古器法物書畫之屬，往復觀摩者久。嗣官京師，與吳郁生葉昌熾江標訂交，月旦翰藻，幾乏虛日。在蘇時，復興愙齋顧　鄭文焯等，結書盡社於怡園，栩老實主其事。識聞旣日廣如斯，藝事能不超軼前塵耶？或云：吳湖帆氏嘗見年羹堯像，謂老人面部上端酷肖之，下部則似左宗棠，故其貌威武，絕不類文弱之士。</p>
<p>老人復擅數理，甲戌任事輿地局，局附製造局內，因及窺岡繪機械學之空　。光緒間，中日之役，愙齋屬將魏光　，不能撥啓新砲，稔老人素諳此道，邀司其職，卒百發必中，屢奏膚功云。已而先後兩掌江西湖北學政，倡導實學，成村頗衆，如今居覺生劉禺生但　張知本何成濬輩，一時俱出門下。其在湖北維政任內，名士梁豐分，以劾李合肥，黜充兩湖書院山長有年，至友張之洞等，屢疏引援，無能爲力，老人遂援年終考　例，列鼎芬優等，得呈准開復叙用，其求賢若渴之精神，於茲表襮元遺。逮癸　後，偕尢先甲創蘇州商會，與陸元鼎設學校，在在革新政敎，功亦不可沒。說者譽其思想新穎，蓋非偶然。</p>
<p>洎乎民初，卜築於南翔仙槎橋畔，顏所居日槎南草堂，杜門却掃，日以揮灑自遣；惟掖植後進，仍一如主湖北學政時然，而於吳湖帆顧起　袁安圃陳巨來四人，寄望最股，至今果各有成就，足徵目光深達，不伴常人也。</p>
<p>當其八十攬揆之辰，門人居覺生何成濬等分別聯名奉獻壽屏一堂，儀金四千，並登堂侑觴，祝壽無疆。公壁謝現金，　瓢自若，可徵其風骨嶙峋，耿介拔俗也已。著栩緣隨筆日記詩文集稿各若干卷。又急齊集占錄中，間或字之未備者，老人賡續成之。年前，顧起潛先生爲刊　集，並撰行狀，老人獲此之傳，將益行之　遠</p>
<h3>賈似道廢宅</h3>
<p>— 施叔範</p>
<p>買秋　宅，在天台城中妙山之北麗，今遺廢址甚廣，半貨箕戶，半藝黍稷，當地父老，猶能娓娓道其故事。似道旣敗，舉族羞之，咸改姓爲葉，故赤城華頂之間，後遂無復　氏者。生前有手著蟋蟀經，迄猶藏西鄉葉祠內，顧其子孫頗諱秘之，陳丈甲林曾一寓目，謂字甚娟秀，絕如其詩，譜中列「黑頭將軍」等名號，蓋最勇猛之秋虫封錫也。嘗論秋壑爲人，小有才，而好歛財嫉才，又當危局，故爾不免。使在今日，則腰纏遠行，雲海無阻，亦何至便死木綿菴中哉？余昔匏繫彼邦，每過洗連，　眼如見，輒誌所感。</p>
<p>苔埋廢礎土花斑，　馬池荒祿一灣，秋　半　好名字，奈何撥草送江山？</p>
<p>當門禾黍秀成行，不說　　宰相坊？月上瓜棚圍野老，是非還在趙家莊。</p>
<p>忍與深山鹿豕親，傷心先世有權臣！議封蟋蟀經三卷，百里內無賈姓人。</p>
<p>手揚金粉鑠東南，敗自風流死未甘，浮海乘雲今代事，嗟渠宛轉木綿菴。</p>
<h3>太平公醮</h3>
<p>— 史鳳</p>
<p>又是打太平公醮的時節了，雖然數十年來由於時代的進展和新科學的影饗，大部份的人都已感到打醮的無聊和浪費，竭力提倡廢止，但一班沒有新思想和迷信的商民却還對打醮含有浦限的信仰，深信打醮確能超度亡魂，保護人口的太平，寗願化費無數錢財，執迷不悟！</p>
<p>筆者家裏日前就有數人拿了黃簿子來募捐，並且申言至少捐一百萬元。我不禁吃了一驚。做別的善舉，如捐助學金，捐洗動診療車的經費，及捐普善山莊等等極有意義而能實際嘉惠於受難的人們的，尙且隨願樂助，多少不計，想不到這純爲鬼魂的「善舉」倒要設下限度，非捐多少不可，眞是荒謬極了！</p>
<p>昨大弄外，就搭起了高高的凉棚，臨風飄起了用草繩繫住的紙衣紙褲和紙錠，四周還立了無數紙紮的鬼怪，十　個道士，吹吹打打地鬧起來了。到了晚上，還是大鑼大鼓地吵個不休，害得四周的居民不得入睡。今天還繼續一犬，晚上還要燒化大批紙東西，我眞躭心會發生火災！據說這一次費用要五億多（當然經手人有相當的好處），我想，假如能把這筆化費在吹打與火光中的五億多捐給慈善機關或助學機構，而直接有助於社會，　非有意義得多？</p>
<p>今日相信鬼怪作祟者，早該爲時代所洶汰了。要內心安慰，還是發些眞的慈悲，去救救那些患病而沒錢醫治的貧民，及有志而沒法求學的學生好！而我們的警察當局旣有拆掉石人的勇氣，那麼對這稱假打醮之名歛財的行爲，似乎也應該多多加以注意罷？</p>
<p>###</p>
<p>舊京商民人等有種特別幽默的勁兒，世事無論如何不安，境况無論如何不裕，若未至最後關頭，常能表示悠閒態度。北地風土人情，與華中南有靜躁之殊，即如「鈔」之迭「大」，生活之煩悶，由驚訝面轉爲麻　，由麻痺面又轉入胡調苦笑。神經之變態，亦可反映現象之一般。</p>
<p>市間買賣，皆省略「萬」字，例如三十萬一件的東西，則說「三十」，餘可類推。但在十數以下的「九萬」「八萬一以至一兩萬等，仍用著「萬」字，因單位數一個音，不便於口。故「萬」字僅爲凑足口氣之用。但有時呼做幾個「子兒」或幾個「大」！例如賣西瓜切片出售者，高喊「五個子兒一大塊」，「三個子兒一小塊」，所謂「子兒」，即萬元鈔或五百關金鈔，而借用舊時「銅元」之「子兒」（銅子兒，如南方所謂銅板銅角子）。又如賣豆汁，窩頭，及零食小物者，喊「幾個大一碗」，「幾個大一塊」，亦指「萬」而言。舊制錢時代，一個錢謂之一個大，更見古色古香。</p>
<p>現時還算是萬爲計算單位的階段（「千」已成過去，「億」則汨汨其來之候），法幣票面發至萬元而止，此在法幣方面即是最大之鈔，但已日見稀少，僅爲小買賣或小零數之用。此外所謂幾十萬幾百萬幾千萬，雖指法幣計數，實際出入皆「關老爺」矣。（舊都市問常呼關金爲「關老爺」，以北方商店習慣供關公爲財神，畫像座前有金元寳銀元寳兩大盆，因俗傳曹操優待關公，上馬贈金，下馬贈銀，戲劇及小說又有「關雲長掛印封金」節目，故謂「關金」爲「關公之金」，亦附會成趣。至於Custom　gold　units之義，則非若輩所能了解。）</p>

<h3>US Aid Construction Fund Allocation: Responsible Parties Confer in Shanghai; Yu Hung-chun, Lockwood, Stillman, and Others Arrive in Shanghai; Part of Proceeds from Sale of Goods Frozen</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 14th] Yu Hung-chun, Lockwood, Shen Hsi-jui, and other responsible figures for the implementation of US aid, flew to Shanghai by China National Aviation Corporation plane at 2:30 PM on the 14th. Yen Chia-kan, US Aid Liaison Commissioner, also left for Shanghai by night train on the 14th. Meetings of various US aid groups will be held in Shanghai within days. The amount of the US aid construction fund will be determined after Stillman returns to Shanghai. It is rumored that it may increase from 60 million US dollars to 70 million US dollars, and including the 10 million US dollars for industrial allocation, it may reach 80 million US dollars.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 14th] Regarding the issue of how to use the funds after the sale of US aid materials, the Chinese and American sides are still in discussion. Part of the funds will be frozen. Article 5, Paragraph 5, Item A of the Sino-US Bilateral Agreement already has provisions for this. What remains to be discussed is the amount to be frozen and the amount to be used for other purposes. Currently, neither the Chinese nor American sides have proposed any plans for their use.</p>
<p>[Our Dispatch] Stillman, head of the US Technical Cooperation Mission, arrived in Shanghai by Pan American flight at 1:00 PM yesterday. Those who went to the airport to welcome him included Hsu Pang-yu, director of the Technical Department of the US Aid Utilization Council, and many staff members of the Economic Cooperation Administration. Mr. Stillman wore a dark blue suit, looked energetic, and refused to disclose the exact amount and allocation of the US aid construction fund. However, he stated that he would hold several meetings soon to discuss the matter with the Chinese side.</p>
<p>[Our Dispatch] The handling of the proceeds from the sale of US aid materials is clearly stipulated in the Sino-US Bilateral Agreement, which states that they should be deposited in a "special account of the Chinese government" in the Central Bank. The future use of these funds is also specified as being for the stability of finance and currency value. Rumors that the US Aid Council would entrust other national banks to assist in collecting the funds and then transfer them to the Central Bank on the fourth day are actually a continuation of the transitional measures agreed upon by the former China Relief and Rehabilitation Administration. Now, the Council has officially decided, in accordance with the Bilateral Agreement, that the proceeds from the allocation and sale will also be directly collected and deposited by the Central Bank. As for whether to entrust other national banks and bureaus to collect the proceeds from the future sale of other large-scale US aid materials, the Central Bank is also carefully considering this.</p>

<h3>Rural Reconstruction Plan to be Submitted to a Five-Person Joint Committee for Discussion and Decision; Chiang Meng-lin Discusses Working Principles</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, This City Dispatch] Chiang Meng-lin, the newly appointed chairman of the China Rural Reconstruction Joint Committee of the US Aid Utilization Council, told reporters on the 14th that concrete plans for using US aid to reconstruct China's rural areas will be discussed and decided in a meeting after the two American committee members arrive in China. Yen Yang-chu has already drafted a proposal, which will soon be submitted to the five-person committee for final decision. It is hoped that various tasks will be launched quickly after the plan is finalized. Mr. Chiang stated that, in his personal opinion, "starting from a small area" is the only principle that can allow limited funds to exert their full effect. In other words, general tasks such as sanitation, education, cooperation, and increased production can be started in fixed areas and then expanded. As for specialized tasks such as water conservancy and pest control, they can be carried out nationwide without being limited to specific areas. Mr. Chiang stated, after recounting his long-term experience in contacting rural areas, that ignorance, poverty, and disease are the three major problems of Chinese farmers. Education can eliminate ignorance, sanitation can eliminate disease, and eliminating poverty is not easy. However, we will start with revitalizing rural handicrafts and restoring the rural economy to eliminate poverty. Reforming the land system is important, but this can only be done with the full and comprehensive implementation of the government. Mr. Chiang indicated that the working staff of the committee must have the spirit of hard work and service, so local talent will be the main focus.

<h3>Our Ships Returning from Japan: Allied Headquarters Refuses to Supply Fuel</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Tokyo Dispatch, 13th] Allied Headquarters has refused the request of the Overseas Transport Bureau, submitted through our country's delegation in Japan, for the supply of oil and provisions to our ships currently sailing between China and Japan when they return to China. Recently, the Bureau requested a monthly supply of 10,000 tons of oil, a large quantity of coal, and other provisions for our ships. The payment for these supplies would be settled by the Central Trust Bureau. The Foreign Trade Section of Allied Headquarters replied that the insufficient production of coal to meet Japan's needs has prevented the relaxation of restrictions on coal reserves, which can only be used for emergencies. Moreover, each allocation of coal must be paid for in cash.

<h3>The President Visited Hanpo Kou Yesterday; Received Ambassador Badger and Others at Noon</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Kuling Dispatch, 14th] The President did not go out in the morning of the 14th. Chen Pu-lei went to visit him around 10:00 AM and they walked together in the garden of the official residence for a long time. Ambassador and Mrs. Badger, Consultant Fu Ching-po, and others, accompanied by Secretary Yu Chien-wen, walked around the main street around 10:00 AM.

<p>[Our Newspaper, Kuling Dispatch, 14th] The President visited Hanpo in the evening of the 14th and looked out for about half an hour before returning. The President and his wife originally planned to invite Ambassador Stuart, Mr. and Mrs. Badger, and others for a picnic at Hanpo in the evening of the 14th to enjoy the spectacular moonrise. Around 7:00 PM, the President and his wife left the official residence together. The President went ahead, while the Madam invited Ambassador and Mrs. Badger and others. However, a sudden rain shower occurred, and the Madam and Ambassador and others stopped going because of the rain. The President went ahead despite the rain and looked out at Hanpo alone for half an hour before returning. The President arrived at Hanpo at 7:00 PM, got out of the sedan chair outside the archway, and walked forward on foot. The President was in excellent spirits and looked cheerful. He was wearing a yellow military uniform, yellow leather shoes, and a gray soft hat, and was wearing glasses. As he climbed the steps, there were more than a dozen male and female tourists picnicking in the pavilion. Reporters also rushed there despite the rain. When the President saw the large number of tourists, he smiled and asked, "Where are you from?" They replied that they were students from the Nanchang Chung Cheng Medical College and reporters. The President asked, "Where are you now?" The students replied, "We are at the Lushan Hospital." The President also asked how many patients there were in the Lushan Hospital and what diseases they had. The students answered one by one. At that time, the President was in high spirits and said, "Come, come, let's take a picture together." So he took a photo with everyone. The President continued to walk to the farthest small pavilion and looked out at the scenery of Poyang Lake. Hanpo is the main road to Xingzi County, facing Poyang Lake, and its steepness seems to swallow Poyang Lake. The terrain is magnificent and the view is wide open. The President likes this place the most and always comes to visit whenever he climbs Kuling. At that time, the rain had cleared and the sun was setting, casting a rosy glow on the lake, creating a beautiful and magical scene. Unfortunately, it was still early and the new moon had not yet risen. The President lingered for a long time and still walked back. The tourists had not left yet. The President said, "Aren't you going back yet?" The students replied, "We are waiting to see the moonrise." The President nodded and smiled and said, "You can go back now." Then he slowly got into the sedan chair and returned directly to the official residence, where he still had dinner with Ambassador Badger and others.</p>

<h3>The Ministry of Finance Rectifies Financial Institutions; Two Banks' and Firms' Licenses Revoked; A Comprehensive Inspection is Being Carefully Planned</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing Dispatch, 14th] The Ministry of Finance has resolved to earnestly implement the rectification of financial institutions. This rectification work has already begun to be implemented gradually. The regular inspection of banks and firms has been strengthened compared to before.

Following the closure of the Hankou branch of the China Industrial and Mining Bank due to illegal engagement in commerce, the licenses of the Xi'an branch of the Overseas Chinese Industrial Bank and the Beiping Changxing Silver Firm have recently been revoked by the Ministry of Finance. The former was due to a "shortage in clearinghouse settlement" of more than 2 billion yuan, while the latter was due to the establishment of secret accounts and illegal business operations, both of which violated the Banking Law and the Regulations on Strengthening the Control of Financial Business. It is also learned that the inspection of banks and firms in various places is carried out by the Financial Supervisory Bureau in areas where Financial Supervisory Bureaus have been established, while the Central Bank is entrusted by the Ministry of Finance to carry out the inspection in areas where Financial Supervisory Bureaus have not been established. As for a comprehensive general inspection of banks and firms, due to the many technical problems in its implementation, it is currently being carefully planned.</p>

<h3>Third Anniversary of Japan's Surrender</h3>
<p>What day is today? Today is the third anniversary of Japan's unconditional surrender and the day Japan formally accepted the Potsdam Declaration. Taking August 15, 1945 as the boundary line, the most tragic World War II in human history began to declare its end. People in every corner of the world rekindled new hope in joy and encouragement, expecting that the cruel war tragedy would never be repeated and that the hope for lasting peace could be achieved. This hope is naturally particularly fervent among the Chinese people who have suffered aggression and persecution. Even in Japan, apart from a few remnants of military cliques and zaibatsu, more than 90 percent of the Japanese people are certainly pursuing bright hopes and praying that Japan can achieve true peace, democracy and happiness from now on.</p>
<p>Japan's fourteen consecutive years of war of aggression, starting with the September 18th Incident in the Northeast, predetermined her fate of failure. Therefore, it is said that Japan's defeat was not accidental but inevitable. In July 1943, after setbacks in military operations on both the Eastern and Western fronts, Japan requested Germany to make peace with the Soviet Union, and she indicated to the Soviet Union that she would consider withdrawing from the Far East war and requested mediation with the United States and China. After Germany's defeat and unconditional surrender, Japan constantly made peace overtures to the Soviet Union. It was not until August 4, 1945, when the United States dropped the first atomic bomb on Hiroshima, and August 8, when the Soviet Union formally declared war on Japan, that Japan ceased its peace overtures and prepared for a last-ditch struggle. On August 10, the U.S. atomic bomb attacked Nagasaki again, and unprecedented chaos occurred in Tokyo. The Japanese government and the Supreme Command recognized that the end of the war had arrived, and announced to the whole world at 8:30 p.m. that day: "Japan has decided to accept the Potsdam Declaration." Subsequently, Japan entrusted the Swiss government to forward the instrument of surrender to China and the United States respectively, and the Swedish government to forward it to the United Kingdom and the Soviet Union. On the afternoon of the 11th, U.S. Secretary of State Byrnes, on behalf of the four governments, sent a reply to the Swiss Embassy in the United States to be forwarded to Japan, stipulating the surrender plan in the reply. At noon on the 14th, the Emperor of Japan convened the last Imperial Conference in the palace. Emperor Showa made the final decision in tears, fully accepting the Potsdam Declaration and Byrnes' surrender plan, only requesting to retain the issue of the Emperor of Japan. At noon on the 15th, Showa broadcast the imperial rescript of surrender to the Japanese military and civilians. From that moment on, soldiers laid down their swords, factories stopped work, and preparations were made for the signing of the surrender terms and the arrival of the Allied occupation forces.</p>
<p>The Allied forces entered and occupied Japan on August 28; the signing of Japan's instrument of surrender took place on September 2. After the Allied forces entered and occupied Japan, General MacArthur served as the commander and represented the eleven countries of the Far Eastern Commission, supervising the implementation of the control of Japan. The fundamental principles of the Allied control of Japan are based on the Potsdam Declaration, which can be summarized into six points: (1) to eradicate militaristic ideology and build a new order in Japan; (2) to dissolve and demobilize the armed forces; (3) to punish war criminals; (4) to establish basic human rights and restore freedom of speech, thought and religion; (5) to maintain the minimum standard of living; (6) to thoroughly democratize politics. The Allied occupation control shall last until the above-mentioned objectives are achieved. According to the Potsdam Declaration, it was a message to Japan issued with the consent of the United States, China and the United Kingdom. The spirit of the Potsdam Declaration is sacred and great; the provisions of the Potsdam Declaration are absolutely correct. The provisions of the Potsdam Declaration regarding Japan took effect de facto and de jure from August 15, 1945. At least before the conclusion of a peace treaty with Japan, the provisions of the Potsdam Declaration should be unchangeable.</p>
<p>However, in the past three years, have the sacred provisions of the Potsdam Declaration been thoroughly implemented? Has the militaristic ideology of Japan been completely eradicated? Have the Japanese people truly gained democracy and freedom? Has Japan's war system been completely eliminated? In a word, Japan in the three years since its surrender has not truly realized the sacred provisions of the Potsdam Declaration in terms of politics, economy, culture, and society, and some facts show that there is even a significant distance from the provisions of the Potsdam Declaration. Looking at the Yoshida, Katayama, and Ashida cabinets under the new constitution, they have not created democracy for the Japanese people since they came to power. Is this not an irony of the new constitution? The dissolution of the zaibatsu has indeed been implemented, but equity has never been reorganized, and are the Japanese zaibatsu not still "remotely controlling 80 percent of the industrial, commercial and financial circles" in fact? The agricultural land system has undergone several reforms, but apart from the expansion of land ownership by landlords and owner-farmers, not even one tenant farmer has been able to purchase land. Taking the "Five-Year Economic Reconstruction Plan" as an example, its stipulated industrial and mining output far exceeds the level of 1930-34, but its stipulated national living standard is below this base year, which is obviously not for alleviating the suffering of the Japanese people's lives. In short, the measures to control Japan in the past three years, as well as the Japanese government's implementation of the surrender terms, have resulted in the opposite of efficiency. Facts show that Japan is re-embarking on the road to recovery. This road to recovery is not the recovery of the life and culture demanded by the Japanese people, but the gradual recovery of Japanese militarism. What a great threat this is to China and the world!</p>
<p>August 15 is one of the days in human history worth commemorating. On this day, we look at the difficulties of the times and feel a lot of emotion. In the past three years, apart from the fact that Korea, which was previously annexed by Japan, has finally been able to formally establish an independent national government today, and Taiwan, which was ceded by Japan, has returned to its Chinese motherland, we really cannot see how much substantial change has taken place within Japan. But we still believe in the famous saying of the late U.S. President Roosevelt: "Our war is to seek lasting peace, lasting peace. In addition to ending the war, we must also end the buds of all wars." We also believe that the demands and goals of the Chinese and Japanese people are consistent, and the rise of Japanese militarism is opposed by the Chinese and Japanese people. We commemorate the third anniversary of Japan's surrender, hoping to awaken the vigilance of the Allied countries, face the sacred spirit of the Potsdam Declaration squarely, convene a peace conference with Japan as soon as possible, thoroughly settle the Japan issue, and jointly support Japan to move towards a truly peaceful and democratic path in accordance with the provisions of the peace treaty. This is our greatest hope today.</p>

<h3>One Year of Indian Independence</h3>
<p>— (Compiled by the Newspaper's Archives)</p>
<p>Last year on this day (August 15th), India formally gained independence and freedom, bringing an end to over a hundred years of British rule.</p>
<p>Looking back on the historical events of this year of independence, we can see that the new government has encountered many difficulties. First and foremost, the large-scale bloody conflicts that occurred on the border between India and Pakistan shortly after independence not only devastated the social economy of the area, but also created millions of displaced refugees, posing enormous challenges to the new government. In addition, famine widely threatened India, partly due to the partition plan that carved out major grain-producing areas from India, and partly due to the short-sighted policies of previous rulers, which caused periodic famines. Both of these issues, if not handled properly, could have impacted the future of the new country.</p>
<p>Today, India can proudly say that it has overcome the two major problems mentioned above, and its independent and free future is not threatened in the slightest. Refugees have been properly resettled and re-employed, the social economy of the Punjab province has also been rebuilt, and the extreme problems between India and Pakistan, after months of patient meetings and discussions, have been largely resolved. The future of the relationship between the two countries is much brighter than it was at the beginning of independence. The famine crisis has also been overcome, and for the first time in nearly six years, India can plan for a surplus of food?</p>
<p>In addition, there is another, more dangerous factor threatening India's survival, which is the conspiracy of internal extremists. They oppose the lofty ideals of the new Indian society of non-discrimination based on class or belief, and of religious equality and freedom, and deliberately sabotage it. The assassination of Gandhi on January 30th was the climax of this conspiracy. As a result, thanks to the government's just handling, broad-mindedness, and the mobilization of public opinion for sanctions, the elements of conspiracy and rebellion were finally suppressed.</p>
<p>Kingdoms' Accession</p>
<p>Since independence, more than six hundred kingdoms, occupying five hundred thousand square miles of land and seventy-five million people, have automatically acceded to the Indian territory. These many kingdoms were not part of British India in the past. They were independent political entities, only subject to British political control through treaty relations. Among them, the kingdom of Mysore, with eight million people, and the kingdom of Travancore, with six million people, both have modern industries and high administrative efficiency, and are very important among the kingdoms. The others are smaller. These many kingdoms are scattered throughout the region, and are interdependent with India in terms of economy, defense, and transportation. After India's independence, they have successively returned. Now, with the exception of the Kingdom of Hyderabad, the rest have transferred their political power to neighboring provinces. From then on, the power of the new Indian government has expanded from the Himalayas in the north to Cape Comorin in the south, greatly increasing the confidence of the newborn India.</p>
<p>Social Reform</p>
<p>The newborn India is also working hard on social reforms, eliminating the traditional concepts of non-interaction between various ethnic groups and classes, and legally affirming the improvement of women's status in society. The ancient Indian laws, which had not been amended in any way during the British rule, are now being carefully studied and revised. Another part of the new Indian code has been drafted and has been submitted to the legislative process.</p>
<p>Industrial Development</p>
<p>In the past year, despite the lack of essential tools, industrial development and the implementation of industrialization plans have achieved good results. Four hydroelectric power and irrigation projects have started one after another, benefiting vast lands with irrigation, and at the same time providing a large amount of electricity for industrial use. Among them, the Damodar Valley project is the largest, completely modeled after the American TVA design, which will completely change the face of Bihar Province. In March of this year, the first ship built in India was launched, and railway locomotives also began to be built by themselves. Many basic industries are being planned and implemented, and large-scale steel industries have also been planned by the government. The training of industrial technicians and the industrialization plan are being carried out in parallel. In the past, four higher technical personnel training centers were established, and a Scientific Research Department was established, directly supervised and directed by the Prime Minister of the Cabinet, to carry out large-scale research work, and to be responsible for scientific and technological guidance and cooperation.</p>
<p>Future Prospects</p>
<p>The above is a bright picture, but on the other hand, India still has some difficulties ahead, such as the Kingdom of Hyderabad's failure to agree to accede, and the Kashmir issue remaining unresolved. The Kashmir dispute has been submitted to the Security Council, but there is no hope of resolution, so military action is still continuing.</p>
<p>Despite these difficulties, India's achievements in the past year have been extremely brilliant. It has consolidated its international position and its currency is very stable. In particular, the new India has shown the world that it not only cherishes the independence and freedom it has worked so hard to obtain, but also has the determination and strength to maintain this independence and freedom.</p>

<h3>Formal Establishment of the Republic of Korea - Grand Ceremony Held in Seoul Today - Britain and Canada Prepare to Recognize the Korean Government</h3>
<p>[United States Information Service, Seoul, 14th] The founding ceremony of the Republic of Korea will be held grandly tomorrow. MacArthur has decided to personally attend the ceremony in Seoul. The main speaker at the ceremony will be Syngman Rhee, the first president of the new republic.</p>
<p>[Chung Tien News Agency, Nanjing, 14th] The President issued the following order on the 14th: Liu Yu-wan is specially appointed as the diplomatic representative with the title of Ambassador of the Republic of China to Korea. This order.</p>
<p>[This newspaper, Panyang, 14th] Korean residents in Panyang will hold a celebration meeting on the 15th to celebrate the establishment of the Korean government. Korean residents in Panyang will hang flags for a day to celebrate.</p>
<p>[United Press, London, 13th] A Foreign Office spokesperson stated today that Britain intends to recognize the South Korean government. They said that the issue of Britain's formal recognition of the South Korean government will be raised when the UN General Assembly studies the report of the Korean Commission. They said that the US government's establishment of a special relationship with the South Korean government is very legitimate, as the South Korean government was produced by a national election under the supervision of the United Nations.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Ottawa, 13th] According to Canadian radio broadcasts, the Canadian government is now considering de facto recognition of the South Korean government.</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 13th] The training of senior Korean military officers in the United States is now considered clear evidence of the United States' intention to cooperate with Koreans in South Korea to counter the overwhelming influence of the Soviet Union in North Korea. Following the US recognition of the Syngman Rhee government, it was announced that six senior Korean military officers are coming to the US to study infantry tactics.</p>
<h3>Protesting Soviet Kidnapping of Soviet Teachers - Discord Between US and Soviet Union Intensifies - State Department Refutes Soviet Accusations</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 13th] The US and the Soviet Union exchanged diplomatic accusations against each other on the 13th regarding the case of two Soviet teachers. The two teachers feared for their lives if they returned to their home country, and both seem likely to be granted asylum in the United States. The State Department publicly refuted Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov's claim that the US government "acquiesced in the kidnapping" of Mrs. Kasenkina and Mr. Samarin. The State Department also indirectly but firmly rejected Molotov's demand to "release" the two and return them to the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>Department spokesman McDermott reiterated Secretary of State Marshall's remarks of several days ago, namely that protecting political prisoners who dare not return to their home country is the established policy of the United States. Soviet Ambassador Panyushkin had made two verbal protests to the State Department this week and requested and was granted a meeting with Under Secretary of State Lovett on the 13th, but the Soviet Embassy ultimately canceled the appointment, presumably due to the rapid development of the Kasenkina case. According to McDermott, he could not specifically state whether the Kasenkins would be allowed to stay in the United States, as the State Department had not yet received an official report on the case. Privately, US diplomats believe that the case has put Molotov in a very difficult position. They said that Molotov apparently did not know that Mrs. Kasenkina had fallen from the Soviet Consulate in New York the evening of the 12th, thus thwarting Soviet efforts to send her back to her home country, when he issued an angry denunciation on the evening of the 12th. Mrs. Kasenkina feared that once she returned to her home country and fell into their hands, her life would be in danger. The State Department's "Voice of America" radio station broadcast this matter to the world on the 13th.</p>
<h3>State Department Advisor Flies to New York to Investigate</h3>
<p>[United Press, New York, 13th] State Department legal advisor Gross has flown here from Washington to meet with all local judicial authorities and immediately reiterate the State Department's provision that the diplomatic privileges of consular officials do not mean that they are exempt from punishment for criminal offenses. Gross added: "However, whether a crime can be found in the police report is still a hypothetical question. In view of the Soviet protest, I do not want to discuss this point at this time." He met with senior officials of the New York City Police Department, personnel of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and district attorneys of the federal and New York State for nearly an hour. Gross emphasized that the State Department is not participating in the investigation of Mrs. Kasenkina's special escape from the Soviet Consulate, "This is not the task of the State Department, but in responding to the Soviet protest and further discussions with the Soviet government, the information collected by local judicial authorities will be considered."</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, New York, 13th, United Press] State Department legal advisor Gross said that although consular officials enjoy diplomatic immunity, they should still be punished for criminal acts. Mrs. Kasenkina jumped out of a window on the third floor of the Soviet Consulate to escape, and the scene was extremely dangerous. O'Dwyer has ordered the police to prepare a report on the investigation of Mrs. Kasenkina's escape from the consulate and submit it to the judicial authorities. If it is proved that Mrs. Kasenkina was detained, then the crime of the Soviet Consulate will be established. The State Department stated that the immunity enjoyed by consular officials is different from that enjoyed by ambassadors and ministers.</p>
<h3>US-Soviet Friction Over Espionage Case Causes Concern in British Diplomatic Circles - May Thus Ruin Four-Power Negotiations</h3>
<p>[United Press, London, 14th] Western diplomats, seeing the increasingly harsh rhetoric from Moscow, fear that the New York teacher case may undermine the success of the Kremlin's four-power negotiations. Observers point out that the Moscow discussions have entered a critical stage, and any major international event could shatter the glimmer of hope for a preliminary agreement on the Berlin and German issues. Western European diplomats here are particularly concerned about the so-called American "hysteria of espionage fear." One person compared the Kasenkina incident to the Canadian case and pointed out the differences in handling: the United States held sensational hearings by Congress, while Canada conducted an investigation by a Royal Commission, followed by prosecution, trial, and sentencing. One Western diplomat said: "Now is the time for calm reason. If there is ever a time when there is no need for nervous, irresponsible, and unnecessarily provocative actions, it is now."</p>
<h3>Soviet Consul General Detained Mrs. Kasenkina</h3>
<p>US May File Indictment</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, New York, 13th, United Press] After Mrs. Kasenkina accused him of detaining her for six days, New York Mayor O'Dwyer stated today that the US will soon file an indictment for this, and the State Department will directly intervene.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, New York, 14th] Mrs. Kasenkina, the Soviet teacher whose life-threatening jump from a window has further strained US-Soviet relations, is said to have stated to the police that she was not only confined in the Soviet Consulate, but that the Soviet ambassador to the US had personally met with her. According to the New York Times, Mrs. Kasenkina stated to the New York police authorities that Soviet Ambassador to the US Panyushkin had come to the consulate and tried to obtain evidence from her that she had not been detained. The statement reportedly stated that although Panyushkin had personally promised that she would not be punished by the Soviet side in the future, she still refused to sign the above evidence.</p>
<h3>US Investigating Committee Subpoenas Mrs. Kasenkina</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 13th] The investigation director of the House Un-American Activities Committee, Stripling, will go to New York tonight to subpoena Mrs. Kasenkina, the Soviet female teacher who was injured after jumping from a window inside the Soviet Consulate General. Stripling said that the House Un-American Activities Committee wants to hear any plans Mrs. Kasenkina has to say about communist control of the world.</p>
<p>[United Press, New York, 13th] The House Un-American Activities Committee issued a subpoena to Mrs. Kasenkina on the 13th. The committee's chief investigator, Stripling, left Washington at midnight on the 13th with the subpoena, instructing Mrs. Kasenkina to testify to the congressional espionage investigation agency "as soon as possible." He plans to deliver the subpoena to Mrs. Kasenkina on the morning of the 14th. According to the report on the morning of the 13th, Mrs. Kasenkina is still in "dangerous condition," lying quietly in a heavily guarded ward at Roosevelt Hospital.</p>
<h3>Soviet Vice Consul Meets Mrs. Kasenkina</h3>
<p>But Refuses to Meet Soviet Consul General</p>
<p>[United Press, New York, 13th] Mrs. Kasenkina, the Soviet female teacher who fell from the fourth-floor window of the Soviet Consulate on the 12th, accused Soviet personnel on the 13th of imprisoning her for six days. When Soviet Vice Consul Kibrik entered Mrs. Kasenkina's ward on the morning of the 13th, Mrs. Kasenkina told him, "You imprisoned me and won't let me go." She refused to meet Soviet Consul General Lomakin. Mrs. Kasenkina kept her eyes closed for most of the time while Kibrik was in the ward. When she opened her eyes, Mrs. Kasenkina did not look at Kibrik. Police are on high alert around Roosevelt Hospital to prevent any attempts to harm Mrs. Kasenkina's life.</p>
<h3>Marshall Refuses to Investigate UN Files</h3>
<p>[United States Information Service, Washington, 13th] Secretary of State Marshall has refused to allow a Senate subcommittee to investigate the confidential passport files of representatives of the United Nations and other international organizations in the United States. Marshall's position is explained in a letter to Senator Revercomb (Republican Senator from West Virginia), chairman of the Senate subcommittee. The task of the subcommittee is to determine whether foreign secret agents are entering the United States under the guise of serving the United Nations. The letter was dated August 7 and released by the State Department today. The Secretary of State pointed out, "Much of the material in the files was obtained confidentially by our country's diplomatic missions abroad, so its confidentiality must be maintained."</p>
<h3>Nehru Calls for Peace on First Anniversary of Indian Independence - Hopes for International Cooperation to Realize the Ideal of Great Harmony</h3>
<p>[United Press, New Delhi, 14th] Prime Minister Nehru met with reporters alone for the first time on the 14th, the first anniversary of India's independence. He told a United Press reporter that unless the world can develop into a global federation and Britain, the United States, the Soviet Union, and other countries agree to coexist within this federation, the world will face a crisis of suicide. Nehru called on major powers to make sincere efforts to resolve disputes and not to attempt to condemn each other. Although he believes that the crisis of a third world war has been somewhat reduced recently, the powder keg still exists because Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union have not made genuine efforts to resolve their differences.</p>
<p>He said: "Between the United States and the Soviet Union, not only are there inconsistencies, but they also hope to create inconsistencies. Both sides are deliberately trying to make the other feel uncomfortable, so the first step that must be taken is the willingness of both sides to reach an agreement. This willingness may not necessarily lead to an agreement, but it is at least a big step forward. A considerable form of world government must emerge in our generation or the next, otherwise the world will be on the path to suicide. Its form and how to build it are still difficult to say now, but it must grow in the credibility of the people." Nehru expressed his views on the form of world government, believing that the world government must be a loose federal system, not only built on a legislative basis, but also on the psychological change in the people's thinking.</p>
<p>India's Future Gradually Brightens</p>
<p>In reviewing India's first year of independence, Nehru said that although India will have disputes over immigration issues, its future is bright. He admitted that India is in an unstable economic situation due to inflation, but he said that the government has taken several measures to save the economic crisis.</p>
<p>Agrees with US Policy Toward Japan</p>
<p>Nehru expressed his approval of the US policy of rebuilding the Japanese economy, saying: "It is unwise to completely suppress a nation like Japan. Reviving Japan on a democratic basis is the only correct policy that can be taken, but appropriate safeguards must be taken to prevent Japan from reorganizing militarism." He believes that the current outbreak of communist activities in Asia is due to economic conditions, which must be remedied. He said: "The most important way to deal with communism is to improve the economic environment."</p>
<p>Regarding the Hyderabad and Kashmir issues, he said: "If Hyderabad insists on its own way, India's independence will become a joke, and the entire southern India will be in danger." Nehru expressed his dissatisfaction with the United Nations' mediation of the methods of India and Pakistan, saying: "To understand the situation in Kashmir, you must understand a basic fact, which is the foreign aggression from Pakistan."</p>
<h3>Three Nations' Envoys Receive New Instructions - To Meet with Molotov Again - Robertson Summoned Back to England for Consultation</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Berlin, 13th] British Military Governor of Germany General Robertson, US Governor Hays, and French Deputy Governor Noirot, were suddenly summoned to London one after another today for consultation on the Berlin crisis and the current Moscow talks.</p>
<p>[United Press, London, 14th] This question newspaper hinted today that the Moscow deadlock may be broken. This news was published at the same time as the return of British Military Governor of Germany Robertson to London. Robertson met with Foreign Secretary Bevin and Foreign Undersecretary Strang on the 14th to provide information on the German situation to assist in the Moscow talks.</p>
<p>A dispatch from Moscow said that, according to reliable sources, Western envoys have received new instructions, including the terms to be proposed at the next meeting with Molotov. It is also known that the three envoys are discussing the drafting of a memorandum at the US Embassy as usual. As soon as it is completed, they will ask the Soviet Foreign Ministry to decide the time for a meeting with Molotov, possibly on the evening of the 14th or the 15th.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, London, 13th] The three-nation committee composed of Strang, Director of the German Affairs Department of the British Foreign Office, Douglas, the US Ambassador to the United Kingdom, and Massigli, the French Ambassador to the United Kingdom, met this afternoon to discuss the report from British envoy Roberts on his recent meeting with Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov. The British Foreign Office is still keeping the news of the Moscow talks strictly secret. Qualified parties all denied the shocking news hinted at by the American newspapers that Britain will now unconditionally accept Soviet participation in West German administration. They pointed out that this news actually only changed what the London Agreement itself said into a shocking way. It should be known that the door to West German political institutions is wide open, and the Soviet Union can join at any time, but the administration of the East Zone must also comply with the democratic principles recognized by the West. As for the Soviet Union's participation in the control of the Ruhr area, Britain will carefully consider this when the Soviet Union continues to refuse to allow the Western powers to participate in the various industries in the Soviet-occupied zone, and refuses to allow the Western powers to continue to enjoy the right to jointly manage the navigation of the Danube River as stipulated in the 1921 Danube River Convention. Judging from the attitude taken by Soviet representative Vyshinsky at the Danube River Conference, the Soviet Union's participation in the control of the Ruhr area has become a very big question.</p>
<h3>Germany Asks to Reject Soviet Currency - Circulation in West Germany</h3>
<p>[United Press, Berlin, 13th] The three major non-communist political parties in Germany, namely the Social Democratic Party, the Christian Democratic Union, and the Free Democratic Party, together with the anti-Soviet trade union executive committee, submitted a memorandum to the military governments of the three Western powers today, requesting that the Western countries refuse to recognize the Mark issued by the Soviet Union as the only legal currency in Berlin, and requesting that the Western Mark be immediately declared the only currency in the Western part. They also urged that the economies of West Berlin and the Western occupied zones be integrated.</p>
<h3>Romania Incorporated into the Soviet Union - Romanian Embassy in the UK Denies</h3>

<h3>Imminent Outbreak of Full-Scale War in the Holy Land</h3>
<p>Jewish Protest Against Destruction of Natrun Water Station</p>
<p>[United Press International, Tel Aviv, 14th] Israeli officials are quietly awaiting the Security Council's response to the Arab destruction of the Natrun water station. However, officials here believe that the United Nations will not condemn the act as a violation of the ceasefire. The Arabs' bombing of the pumping station has brought the prestige of UN mediator Count Bernadotte to a low ebb. Israeli newspapers bluntly advise him to "pack his bags and go home." The Foreign Ministry believes that the United Nations will take some "face-saving action" but will not condemn the Arabs as aggressors. Meanwhile, the Israeli government has already prepared for the fifth stage of the Jewish-Arab conflict - a war of attrition. Therefore, the opposing armies are ready to resume full-scale war at any time.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Tel Aviv, 13th] Israeli Foreign Minister Shertok has protested to the Security Council, accusing Bernadotte of neglect. The most important point is that Bernadotte failed to ensure the supply of water to Jerusalem and allowed the Arab destruction of the Natrun water station.</p>

<h3>Provisional Municipal Assembly Resolves to Reduce Public Utility Prices: Across-the-Board Cancellation of the 50% Increase Based on July's Index; Future Prices to Be Approved by a Public Investigation and Review Committee</h3>
<p>[Our Report] The first Provisional Municipal Assembly of this city, established on the 35th anniversary of the August 13th Shanghai Battle, convened its first extraordinary meeting yesterday to discuss the issue of reducing public utility prices. The meeting began at 3:45 PM, attended by over 160 councilors, Mayor Wu, Director Zhao of the Public Utilities Bureau, and numerous responsible officials from other relevant municipal departments. The meeting began with Chairman Pan reporting on the purpose of the extraordinary meeting, offering two points for discussion: (1) How to provisionally determine prices while considering both the burden on citizens and the continued operation of public utilities. (2) Given the limited time available for this extraordinary meeting, please first consider how to reduce August's new prices, and propose a reasonable calculation method for adjusting prices from September onwards. Furthermore, a proposal from the Mayor was submitted today to organize a Public Investigation and Review Committee for Public Utilities to examine the actual necessary expenditures of various public utilities in the city, in order to determine a price adjustment method to be followed, and it was also submitted for discussion.</p>
<p>Following this, Zhi Hao, one of the conveners of the Municipal Assembly's Public Utilities Committee, reported on the process of repeated meetings of the Public Utilities Committee and subcommittees. After Li Wenjie made a supplementary report on the progress, Mayor Wu reported on his submitted proposal. He pointed out three reasons for especially maintaining public utilities: (1) The profits of public utilities are restricted. (2) They cannot hoard or refuse to sell. (3) They cannot sell goods and collect money at the same time. Reduced adjusted prices can be achieved only if one of the following three conditions is met: (1) If it is found that there are false or reducible items in the account books of various public utilities. (2) If there is a subsidy method. (3) If there is a possibility of obtaining a loan. He stated: "For two years, I have shared weal and woe with the councilors, and I have never encountered such a problem. Therefore, I propose organizing a Public Investigation and Review Committee for Public Utilities to publicly review various issues related to public utilities."</p>
<p>At 5:25 PM, the formal discussion began. Councilors Ma Junshuo, Zhang Zhongyuan, Fei Shusheng, Shao Yongsheng, Jin Runxiang, Fan Xipin, Jiang Huaishu, Wang Jianshi, Yu Shun, Wang Weiyin, Yan Esheng, He Chengfu, Zhou Ruting, Jiang Haoran, Zhu Wende, Qu Yue, Yang Fusheng, and others successively put forward oral or written opinions. At around 8:00 PM, the chairman summarized the councilors' opinions as follows:</p>
<p>Summary of Opinions: Regarding the issue of how to reduce the new prices adjusted in August for various public utilities in the city and what standards should be adopted after September to verify and calculate their prices, the Public Utilities Committee of the Assembly has submitted a review report, and the Mayor has also submitted a separate proposal, both of which have been submitted to the general meeting for discussion. It has been found that if the new price reduction method for public utilities in August is implemented according to the review opinions of the Public Utilities Committee, and fees are charged at the lowest price uniformly, large users of electricity, telephone, gas, etc. can obtain the effect of price reduction, but small users and industrial electricity users have not yet benefited. The nature of tap water and transportation tools is very different, and the rigid requirement to increase the price by 740% compared to July is also still to be considered. Furthermore, after listening to the Mayor's report, if the new price is reduced, the various companies may currently experience a shortage of funds. The various companies should bear their own responsibilities, but in order for the Assembly to enable the continued supply of various public utilities for citizens to enjoy, and to prevent a lack of funds, it seems that an emergency assistance measure should also be taken. As for the temporary standard for calculating the price of public utilities each month after September, the content of the review opinions of the Public Utilities Committee is quite detailed. However, if it needs to be implemented, there should still be a dedicated research and review organization to continue its unfinished work.</p>
<p>Three Resolutions: To achieve a fair reduction of the new prices in August and a more reasonable pricing method after September, it is specifically resolved as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Method for reducing the new prices adjusted for public utilities in August:</p>
<p>1.  Part of Water, Electricity, and Gas: In the formulas used to calculate the new prices in August, any part that uses the cost of living index, exchange rate index, and metal index, the 50% increase based on the actual index in July will be cancelled across the board, and recalculated to reduce. For accounts that should be reduced for each user, those that have not been collected will not be collected, and those that have been collected will be refunded.</p>
<p>2.  Part of Transportation Tools (excluding telephones): Starting from August 18th, the new prices will be reduced by 20%-30% across the board. Each fare will be adjusted accordingly, rounded to the nearest ten thousand.</p>
<p>3.  Part of Telephones: In the formulas used to calculate the new prices in August, any part that uses the cost of living index, exchange rate index, and metal index, the 50% increase based on the actual index in July, and the so-called price difference compensation index will be cancelled across the board, and recalculated to reduce. For accounts that should be reduced for each user, those that have not been collected will not be collected, and those that have been collected will be refunded.</p>
<p>4.  If various public utility companies experience a shortage of funds due to the price reduction in August, in addition to the fact that the board of directors of each company should be responsible for making adjustments, the municipal government will join with the Assembly to organize a petition group to request loans from the central government.</p>
<p>(2) Implementation standards for calculating the price of public utilities each month from September onwards:</p>
<p>1.  The final revised and issued review opinions from the Public Utilities Committee, items 1 to 5, are all approved. However, item 6, the review opinions and the opinions of Councilor Li Wenjie, are sent to the Public Investigation and Review Committee for Public Utilities for study and decision.</p>
<p>2.  The standards for tiered pricing for electricity and telephones should be revised according to the actual situation in the city to be consistent with the true meaning of socialized pricing.</p>
<p>3.  The problem of adapting the supply period of electricity, gas, tap water, etc. to the corresponding payment period should be reasonably regulated.</p>
<p>The above three items are handed over to the investigation and review committee to be organized later for handling.</p>
<p>(3) From September onwards, the pricing of various public utilities in the city will be handled by a publicly-oriented investigation and review committee organized by the municipal government inviting representatives and experts from the Assembly and relevant statutory groups in the city. The committee may request the municipal government to access all relevant accounts and documents, and no public entity may refuse to access them under any pretext. The organizational methods of the committee will be determined separately by the municipal government. As for the selection of Assembly members, the president and vice president are authorized to consult with the Public Utilities Committee to select them, but they are not limited to the members of the Public Utilities Committee. When the committee calculates the price of public utilities from September onwards, it should refer to the various principles listed in the review report of the Assembly's Public Utilities Committee as the standard.</p>
<h3>Smuggling Uncovered on the Haijin Steamer: Piles of Gold Worth an Estimated 500 Billion</h3>
<p>The Jianghai Customs Anti-Smuggling Division received intelligence from Hong Kong on the 11th, stating that the China Merchants Bureau's Haijin steamer, coming from Hong Kong to Shanghai, was suspected of having a huge amount of gold smuggled by the sailors on board. Therefore, on the evening of the 12th, at 8:00 PM, a large number of officers were dispatched in disguise to wait at the China Merchants Bureau's First Wharf. At 11:10 PM that night, the steamer entered the port and berthed, but after waiting until 8:00 AM on the 13th, nothing was found. It was decided to take action and board the ship for a search that lasted an hour. As a result, a package wrapped in paper was found in an iron cabinet in the second head sailor's bedroom. When opened, it turned out to be 75 gold bars, with an estimated value of around 500 billion. However, due to the lack of confidentiality, the second head sailor, Zhang, had already fled upon hearing the news, so he could not be arrested.</p>
<h3>First-Half Index: Increase Less Than Double</h3>
<p>Published This Morning After Review</p>
<p>The cost of living index for the first half of this month will be published by the Municipal Government Cost of Living Index Review Committee after a meeting at the Municipal Government at 10:00 AM today. According to speculation from relevant parties, although the price increase rates for rationed rice and public utilities are quite high, the price increase rates for general grains, clothing, housing, and daily necessities such as soap and cigarettes are slower. Therefore, if based on the price statistics of the above items, the worker's cost of living index for the first half of this month will definitely be less than double the previous period.</p>
<h3>Municipal Finances Increasingly Difficult: Tian Yongqian Proposes Two Methods</h3>
<p>The city's finances are becoming increasingly difficult. Director of Finance Tian Yongqian submitted a written report at yesterday's Provisional Municipal Assembly, suggesting two methods: (1) Following proper channels, request a short-term subsidy from the central government, and ask the Assembly to support this and forward it to the central government for prompt approval. (2) The Finance Bureau is carefully researching and drafting a plan to adjust revenue by the relevant departments, and submitting it to the Assembly for review. If it is considered feasible, please approve and implement it at any time, and report it to the general meeting for retroactive approval in order to seize the time.</p>
<h3>District Prosecutor's Office Prosecutes Two Merchants for Forging Export Permits to Ship Flour</h3>
<p>[Our Report] Ding Xingfu, director of the customs declaration department of Yongfengli Customs Brokerage in this city, previously transported 5,000 bags of flour to Yantai for merchant Ma Jianzhai. On August 2nd of this year, he used a forged food department export permit No. 19893, provided by Ma, to go to the customs to complete customs declaration procedures. Sun Zhongyi, manager of Shuncheng Customs Brokerage, transported 15,000 bags of flour to Qingdao for merchant Ge Chengzhai. On August 2nd, Sun used an export permit No. 19902, forged in Nanjing by Song Guanjiu entrusted by him, to go to the customs to complete customs declaration procedures. The customs officers determined that both of the above permits were forged and handed them over to the District Prosecutor's Office. After the investigation was completed, Ding and Sun were prosecuted for the crime of forging documents.</p>
<h3>Direct Tax Bureau Reduces Staff: Ministry of Finance Dispatches Investigators: Handling Methods to Be Announced Tomorrow</h3>
<p>[Our Report] After the Direct Tax Bureau of this city issued an order from the Ministry to dismiss 112 staff members on the 11th, two of them were veterans transferred to civilian jobs. After negotiations, they were reinstated. As for the other 110 dismissed staff members, they were greatly panicked and believed that the layoffs were unfair, so they organized a "Federation of Laid-Off Personnel" and actively appealed to all parties for justice in recent days. It is said that the Ministry of Finance has set eight standards for the Direct Tax Bureau to reduce staff.</p>
<p>Subsequently, on the 11th, the Direct Tax Bureau announced supplementary measures, including one that stated that if necessary after layoffs according to the above eight standards, further layoffs could be carried out based on the performance appraisal from January to June of the 37th year. However, the bureau did not fully comply with the previous eight standards when implementing the layoffs this time. On the 12th, the laid-off personnel requested Huang Zupei, the director of the bureau, to publicly handle the layoffs and strictly implement the Ministry's regulations. Director Huang immediately went to Beijing to request instructions from the Ministry of Finance. Zhao Peifeng, director of the personnel department of the National Taxation Administration of the Ministry of Finance, and Dou Mengfei, specially commissioned, came to Shanghai yesterday to investigate. The Federation of Laid-Off Personnel sent representatives to meet with the Ministry's representatives yesterday morning. The two representatives replied that public review was impossible, but the reinstatement of those who passed the special examination could be considered. Regarding aftercare issues, they stated that it was not within the scope of their responsibilities. Finally, they instructed the representatives of the laid-off personnel to collect information on the unreasonable aspects of the Direct Tax Bureau's layoffs this time and provide it for reference today, and the handling methods will be announced tomorrow.</p>

<h3>Number One Japanese War Criminal Okamura: Six Points Interrogated in Preliminary Hearing: Public Trial Scheduled for the 23rd at the Municipal Assembly</h3>
<p>[Our Report] Before the official public trial of Okamura Neiji, the number one Japanese war criminal and former commander-in-chief of the Japanese Expeditionary Forces in China, the military court held a preliminary hearing yesterday morning for initial questioning. Okamura claimed to be unaware of and unable to take responsibility for the crimes committed by his subordinates, such as killing our people and destroying our property. After the hearing, he was returned to the Jiangwan War Criminal Prison. The public trial is scheduled for the 23rd at the Municipal Assembly on Tanggu Road, where lawyers Jiang Yiping and Qian Longsheng will defend him.</p>
<p>At around 8:00 AM yesterday morning, the military court dispatched Adjutant Guo Xinfu and gendarmes to the hospital to bring forward Okamura, and the hearing began at 9:00 AM. Judge Shi Meiyu, military judge Zhang Tikun, Ye Zaizeng, clerk Hu Minduo, and translator Luo Di first investigated Okamura's resume. Okamura wore a gray suit, self-lined shirt, blue floral tie, and yellow leather shoes. Due to the sequelae of lung disease, he appeared quite weak, but his complexion was still good. According to his statement: He is 65 years old, from Tokyo, and graduated from the Army University, successively serving as Deputy Chief of Staff of the Kwantung Army, Director of the Second Department of the General Staff Headquarters, Lieutenant General of the 2nd Division, Commander of the 11th Army, and General of the 6th Area Army. In December of the 33rd year of the Republic, he was promoted to Commander-in-Chief of the China Expeditionary Forces, until the Japanese surrender.</p>
<p>Six Points of Questioning - Answers One by One: After Okamura finished stating his resume, he rested for a few minutes, and Judge Shi began questioning, with the questions divided into the following points: (1) Was it an order or his own intention to serve as the commander in China? (2) As a general, how many times did he participate in the Supreme Military Conference of the Greater East Asia War? (3) Before serving as commander-in-chief, Okamura had already fought in China. Was he aware of the killing and arson by the Japanese army? (4) Should Okamura be held responsible for the crimes of murder and arson committed by the 27th Division Commander Ochiai Shinkuro, the 116th Division Commander Hishida Harushiro, the 55th Brigade Major General Brigade Commander Nashioka Hisao, and the Changsha Garrison Commander Funahiki Masayuki, etc., during the war? (5) How many Japanese troops were scattered in China at the time of the Japanese surrender? (6) Was he also responsible for the Japanese Navy and Air Force? Okamura stated regarding the above points: (1) Serving as the supreme commander of the Japanese Expeditionary Forces in China was an order from the government. (2) He did not participate in the Supreme Military Conference of the Greater East Asia War. (3) He did not know about various incidents such as the killing by the Japanese army. He had made an appointment with his subordinates after serving as commander-in-chief. (4) He cannot be held responsible for the crimes of the Ochiai Shinkuro Division, etc., because there are area armies under the commander-in-chief, and army headquarters under the area armies. The division is under the jurisdiction of the headquarters, which is two levels away from the general headquarters, so the division commander should be responsible for their crimes. (5) He did not know exactly how many Japanese troops were in China at the time of the Japanese surrender, probably less than one million. (6) Part of the air force was under his command, but the navy and naval landing forces had their own system. In addition to answering the court's questions verbally, Okamura also presented a written defense in court, the content of which was roughly divided into two points: (1) The responsibility for the crimes of the Japanese army killing Chinese civilians listed in the indictment should be borne by the directly subordinate commanding officer, the division commander. (2) He presented various proofs that he had tried to prevent his subordinates from harming our people.</p>
<p>Smiling Bitterly When Answering Reporters' Questions: The preliminary hearing lasted about three-quarters of an hour before it was adjourned. Okamura was surrounded by reporters, who asked questions one after another. He expressed his gratitude for the lenient and benevolent spirit of the Chinese government and said that he was willing to use his greatest strength to help the Chinese government. When asked if he had any complaints about today's trial, Okamura smiled bitterly, thought for a while, and could not answer. He used to study Buddhism when he was a division commander to calm his mind, and now he hopes to spend the day of the public trial on the 23rd peacefully. He believes that the military revival of Japan is absolutely impossible because Japan is under control, while the weapons of other countries are constantly improving. Okamura also stated his feelings: He is willing to contribute his past experience in the military to China to enable China's military revival, which is the shortcut to stabilizing East Asia.</p>
<p>Judge Shi Fuyu told reporters that the verdict on Okamura Mitsuji would be based on an attitude of no revenge and no leniency. After the public trial is completed, he will exchange views on the verdict with the military judges hearing the case, and the majority opinion will be the final decision, and then he will submit it to the President for approval.</p>

<h3>Kuling Welcomes the President in August</h3>
<p>— Special Dispatch from Kuling by this Newspaper on the 9th, Correspondent Liu Wenqu</p>
<p>Kuling in August is still so tranquil. The temperature hovers between 70 and 80 degrees, neither cold nor hot. After occasional showers or heavy fogs, it is even cooler and more pleasant. With clear mountains and beautiful waters, tourists stroll leisurely through the springs and forests, watching the flowing clouds and water, and feeling as if they are drifting outside the world. There is no tense disturbance in the market, and everything seems to be passing by peacefully.</p>
<p>The President and his wife did not fail the expectations of the people of Kuling and the scenery of Mount Lu, and finally arrived! They arrived amidst the applause of thousands of people who voluntarily lined up to welcome them. This is the President's first visit to Kuling! The smiles of the President and his wife when they greeted the welcoming crowd gave the people of Kuling infinite comfort and left a very deep impression.</p>
<p>The aircraft of the attendants landed at the Shili Pu Airport at more than 9:00 in the morning on the 9th. Walking along the main road from Xin Street, you can see the airport from the mountain gap not far away, but no one seemed to notice it in the morning. Deputy Adjutant General Liu Yuanlin came up the mountain quietly with some people. At noon, they had lunch at No. 39 (the Lixingshe house). Someone saw them and spread the word: "The President is here!"</p>
<p>The most powerful proof is still the President and his wife's vehicle. At 2:15, the sedan chairs carried out from the official residence are recognizable to everyone. The porters wear dark blue uniforms and straw hats, and they are carrying the sedan chairs through the busiest main street. The first sedan chair is empty. After it passes, the second one follows, with someone sitting in it. On closer inspection, it turns out to be Wang Zuomin, the Director of the Administration Bureau. He is going down to Lotus Cave to greet them. Someone is calculating the time the sedan chairs are descending. Judging from the situation, they may arrive at 5 or 6 o'clock.</p>
<p>From 3:00 PM to 8:00 PM, there are more and more people on the street. At least half of the people of Kuling have come out, and the two main streets, Zheng Street and Xin Street, are filled with people. Military police and police are doing everything they can to open a path and block people on both sides. When there is not enough space to accommodate everyone, they extend along the Lian-Gu Avenue, extending for nearly a mile. People who extend out have an unexpected convenience. They can see the airport from the gap, watch the "Meiling" plane take off and land, and also see the Baneshan Pavilion on the opposite mountain and the progress of the sedan chairs on the winding mountain road.</p>
<p>The reflection of the setting sun obscured the fuselage of the "Meiling" plane. At 6:30, the "Meiling" plane landed at Shili Pu. From a distance, the airport, which is only two inches long and one inch wide, only has a black spot on it. Estimating the time, it should be possible to reach Baneshan Pavilion by 7:30. The eyes of the public are staring straight at the opposite mountain, fully expressing their enthusiastic expectations.</p>
<p>The distant mountains and nearby forests are even more beautiful in the evening glow. The scorching sun loses its power, and a gentle breeze blows. Waiting for the arrival of the President and his wife seems more interesting than sightseeing. While waiting, the sun sets behind the mountains, and the twilight deepens. Friends with cameras cannot help but sigh, while on the mountainside of the opposite mountain, the shadows of several mountain sedan chairs faintly appear. Watching them progress, turn, and disappear behind the mountain, they reappear soon after. After passing the Baneshan Pavilion and the Monument, isn't this reaching Tianchikou? The President and his wife are now approaching the enthusiastic crowd step by step. Everyone can freely admire the demeanor of the head of state and his wife. Applause drowns out everything.</p>
<p>Passing through the ranks of people, there are a total of four sedan chairs. The first is the Madam, who greets the people with smiles and waves. The second is the President, who takes off his cork hat and greets the people, constantly nodding and smiling. The third is Yu Jishi, and the fourth is Shi Zude - it is said that this is always the order when climbing Kuling. Some of the attendants are following on foot. The President's long-term porters, eight per sedan chair, can be described as walking like flying. Just as people want to carefully admire them, the sedan chair quickly passes by, leaving only the smiles given by the head of state and his wife.</p>
<p>The order is quite good, and the applause is constant. Even after the President and his wife have passed, the welcoming crowd remains in line to wait. At 8:20, the President and his wife passed through Zheng Street and turned towards Hedong Road.</p>
<p>Soon after the President and his wife entered the official residence, the stars in the clear sky kept blinking, as if they also hoped to catch up with this lively scene. As night fell, Kuling returned to tranquility.</p>
<p>It is said that the main purpose of the President and his wife's visit to Kuling this time is to escape the summer heat and rest. Think about it, the President has such a heavy burden on his shoulders. From preparation to constitutional government, there are countless political disturbances; from peace talks to suppressing the rebellion, there are some military successes and failures. Working hard day and night, he should have a short period of rest in this hot summer. It is said that the President plans to rest in Kuling for two weeks, reducing the burden of government affairs as much as possible. The rumored meeting has already been held. In Kuling, there will not be an excessive burden on our head of state. Today is certainly tiring. From tomorrow onwards, Mount Lu will quietly accept the President and his wife's appreciation.</p>

<h3>250,000 Yuan Denomination Gold Bond Notes to be Officially Issued Starting Tomorrow: Central Bank Official Says the Cash Panic Can Be Resolved</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] Gold Bond Notes with a denomination of 250,000 yuan will be issued tomorrow. These gold bond notes are printed by the Central Printing Plant and have a bright red color similar to the 5 yuan denomination gold bond notes.</p>
<p>According to a responsible person from the Issuing Bureau of the Central Bank, the cash shortage in various places can be resolved after the issuance of the 250,000 yuan denomination gold bond notes. Recently, due to the excessive rise in prices, although the National Bank has issued gold bond notes with denominations of 10,000, 25,000, and 50,000 yuan, there is still a lack of chips in the market. Therefore, at the request of the National Bank, it threw out the original 5,000 yuan denomination of legal currency that was scheduled to be redeemed to meet the needs of the market, which was a last resort. After the 250,000 yuan gold bond notes are issued, the cash panic can be resolved, and the 5,000 yuan small notes can be redeemed in large quantities and will no longer be circulated in the market.</p>
<p>Also, the money market turned from loose to stable yesterday. In the exchange of bills between the four banks, two bureaus, and one treasury and the silver and money industry, there was a large difference in advances, totaling 207.3 billion yuan. Among them, the Central Bank's difference in advances was 28.914 billion yuan, the Bank of China's difference in advances was 2.772 billion yuan, the Bank of Communications' difference in advances was 5 billion yuan, the Farmers Bank's difference in advances was 12.732 billion yuan, the China Investment Trust Bureau's difference in advances was 4.214 billion yuan, the Postal Remittance Bureau's difference in advances was 2.752 billion yuan, the Central Cooperative Treasury's difference in advances was 818 billion yuan, the commercial banks' large exchange difference in advances was 110.346 billion yuan, the small exchange difference in advances was 38.7 billion yuan, and the foreign banks' difference in advances was 28.315 billion yuan.</p>
<p>Also, yesterday, because it was the weekend and the middle of the month, the industry urgently needed it, so the tight cash situation worsened again, and the discount rate in the market rose to one-tenth. The demand for shipping help was even greater than before. The Central Bank also reduced the amount of funds for the same industry, and the exchange numbers before 50 were only 10 billion to 20 billion, and all the others were 5 billion. The national banks and bureaus also only had 30 billion to 50 billion. Therefore, the banks had to severely limit cash withdrawals for customers. Generally, they were allowed 20 million yuan, and some small banks only allowed 5 million yuan.</p>
<h3>Rice Prices Continue to Soar: Retail Prices Break the 70 Million Mark; Rumor That Rice Rationing Will Be Stopped is Untrue</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] Yesterday, rice prices in the city continued to soar. Because of rumors that food will be urgently purchased, people are optimistic, and market conditions have skyrocketed. Retail prices have reached the 70 million mark. The wholesale prices of other commodities, due to the impact of the revival of rumors, slightly tighter money, and other bearish news, have fallen across the board. Cotton cloth, rayon, and silk have all fallen by about 10%, while the prices of yarn and cigarettes and other items are still stable. However, the wholesale prices and retail prices of commodities yesterday seemed to be disconnected, because the monthly cost of living index is about to be released, and stores have raised retail prices in advance, and the price increase of daily necessities is very alarming.</p>
<p>Also, after the rice price skyrocketed, it was rumored in the market that the rationing of grain per capita will also be forced to stop. Wu Guozhen, the chairman of the People's Livelihood Committee, solemnly denied this. He also stated that the rice distributed by the Municipal People's Livelihood Committee will not be affected by the rice price in any way, because the rice for the ninety-day month has already been prepared, and half of the rice for November has also been prepared. Therefore, the rumor that rice rationing will be stopped is absolutely untrue.</p>
<p>The rice market is rising rapidly. Because of the sharp increase in the price of Wuxi, people are excited, causing the cargo owners to try their best to raise the price. The Beishi market once saw an increase of 6 or 7 million yuan, and the closing price turned low. The special high-quality Japonica rice reached 67 million, and other Japonica rice has reached the 60 million mark, each rising by 10%. However, the closing price was 2 million lower due to the decline in various items outside the industry, and people were also empty. The Nanshi market opened 5 or 6 million higher in the early morning, and the closing price became sluggish, with the price falling by 1 or 2 million yuan. Yesterday, a total of 6,840 Shi of goods arrived in the North and South markets.</p>
<p>Flour</p>
<p>Due to the scarcity of wheat, the factory price on the previous day was as high as 24 million. People were unanimously optimistic. The early market price for old cars opened at 25 million, but retreated due to the high opening price. The closing price was even more sluggish due to the low prices of various items outside the industry. As a result, the old car retreated to a closing price of 23.4 million, with a large price fluctuation. The closing price for military ships was 22.7 million, which was still 1.12 million yuan higher than the previous day. Hongfeng and Jiancheng each opened at 23 million. Bran rose by 1 million, and the factory price of wheat rose by another 4 million, opening at 33 million.</p>
<p>Miscellaneous Grains</p>
<p>Continued to rise. The initial market was sharply rising, and the closing price turned weak. The soybean oil gangs continued to take deliveries. The early market rose by 4 or 5 million, and the closing price fell by 2 million due to the decline in oil cake. The Qingdao gang took a lot of corn, rising by 5 million. The closing price was also weak. Yuanmai was taken by both the North and South gangs, rising by 4 million. Sesame rose slightly by 1 million, and the Guang gang did not take raw peanuts, falling by 2 million alone.</p>
<p>Cooking Oil</p>
<p>Turned to the downstream trend. Because the previous day's rise was too much, and because the prices of items outside the industry fell, those who were sensitive to the news took the opportunity to exit the market, and retail investors vomited out the goods. Soybean oil was initially 163 million, and the closing price was 159 million, slightly decreasing by 2 million. Rapeseed oil also slightly fell by 1 or 2 million yuan, raw oil fell by 3 million, Jittong raw oil was 195 million, and the initial market for small car sesame oil was stable, with the closing price falling by 5 million. The bean cake was not taken by the customer gang, and no one cared about it, falling by 30 to 500,000.</p>
<h3>Foreign Exchange Certificates Continue to Rise: Gold Ornaments Rise by Another 20 Million</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the market price of foreign exchange certificates continued to rise sharply, opening at 7.2 million yuan in the morning. Then, due to the fierce purchase by importers, it rose to 7.8 million yuan, and finally slightly returned to 7.6 million yuan. In addition, the negotiated price of gold ornaments in jewelry stores rose by another 20 million yuan due to the rise in foreign exchange certificates, totaling 540 million yuan for purchases and 580 million yuan for sales.</p>
<h3>Inter-Bank Exchange Rate: To Be Revised Starting Tomorrow</h3>
<p>The internal exchange rates of the four banks, two bureaus, and one treasury will be revised as follows starting on the 16th: Xiamen 300 yuan, Fuzhou 250 yuan, Quanzhou and Shantou 300 yuan each, Zhangzhou 350 yuan, Changsha and Hengyang 200 yuan each, Chongqing 300 yuan, Chengdu 350 yuan, Wuhan 200 yuan each, Pingjin 10 yuan, Nanchang and Jiujiang 250 yuan each, Tunxi and Shexian 200 yuan each, Shenyang 10 yuan, Jinzhou 20 yuan, Changchun 10 yuan, Chengde 20 yuan, Zhangjiakou 30 yuan, and other places unchanged.</p>
<h3>The Prosperity of Woolen Fabrics</h3>
<p>Yesterday, Saturday, the woolen fabric market was entirely prosperous. Zhang's floral woolen fabrics sold for 65 million yuan, Hongxiang's floral woolen fabrics for 60 million yuan, China Textile's 1830 serge for 42.5 million yuan, 5009 serge for 35 million yuan, 2901 overcoating fabric for 50 million yuan, and Anle Village overcoating fabric for 22.5 million yuan. Transactions occurred both directly and indirectly at gatherings and among major wholesalers in the Qipan Street area. This was largely due to the loose and ample money supply and the reduced overnight loan rates. Both local and Nanjing merchants increased their purchases, further boosted by the one-tenth increase in prices for China Textile's products on Wednesday and Friday, which strengthened confidence. Further improvements are expected.</p>
<h3>Bulls Unloading, Confidence Weakens: Cotton Yarn Price Increases Slightly Suppressed; Cloth Sales Strong But Prices Weaken</h3>
<p>Yesterday's cotton yarn market conditions saw hesitation due to the rapid and uncontrolled price increases. Subsequently, as credit tightened and customer interest waned, China Textile continued to sell off, increasing supply. Furthermore, due to the Saturday effect, bulls unloaded their positions. Rumors of negotiations within the market further weakened confidence.</p>
<p>Forty-two count Blue Phoenix fine yarn initially plummeted by 200 million yuan. Trading was not very active. Later, some weaving businesses took advantage of the lower prices to absorb some, slightly raising the price. However, it ultimately closed at 3.23 billion yuan for current delivery and 3.33 billion yuan for Monday delivery, a sharp decrease of 120 million to 70 million yuan compared to the previous day. Other counts of coarse and fine yarns also fell by 20 to 30 million yuan, or about 10%, with 75 lots traded.</p>
<p>Yesterday's cotton cloth market saw a selling trend due to excessive price increases the day before. Moreover, with the period for the Construction Textile Company's allocation approaching, current supply was abundant. As credit tightened, customers, awaiting remittances and facing numerous maturing overnight loans, had tight cash positions. Merchants from the north resold actively, while local manufacturers remained cautious and inactive. Market supply exceeded demand.</p>
<p>Twelve-pound Dragon Head fine cloth opened with a decrease of 1 million yuan. Subsequently, as customers from Tianjin sold off at high prices, excess inventory was pressured, leading to frequent liquidations and widespread selling in the market.</p>
<p>After 10:30 AM, the market fell again by 2.8 million yuan. Near the close, short covering pushed the price back up to 84.8 million yuan, a sharp drop of 3.2 million yuan compared to the previous day.</p>
<p>Mid-range goods such as Five Blessings Trumpet, Tong Yang Crane, etc., fell by 3 to 4 million yuan each. Apart from dyed cloth and Shilin cloth, which held steady, other varieties of cotton cloth tended to weaken. 1,760 bolts were traded.</p>
<p>Further News: In the afternoon session, the market selling pressure remained unabated due to tight credit caused by increased activity at the Exchange Bureau. The price of Dragon Head fine cloth would drop immediately after a slight increase. As a result, it closed flat compared to the morning close. Four Gentlemen Yuan Serge was slightly better by 50,000 yuan compared to the afternoon close, with other prices similar.</p>
<p>To cooperate with national policy, China Textile has adopted a policy of large-scale selling in recent days. As long as there are buyers, it will supply as much as possible, and the rising market trend has begun to be curbed. Yesterday, the Yarn Control Committee sold 238 bales of yarn on its behalf, recovering 50,997,000,000 yuan. It also allocated 144 bales on behalf of the Head Office, amounting to 28,800,000,000 yuan.</p>
<p>In addition, China Textile sold 13,090 pieces of cloth and 350 blankets yesterday at list prices, recovering a total of 95,733,000,000 yuan in legal tender.</p>
<h3>Bulls Selling Off, Chinese Stocks Plummet</h3>
<p>Chinese stocks initially weakened and then plummeted yesterday. This was due to the imminent release of the upper period index for this month, which was predicted to be very high. There were rumors that the new economic plan would be unfavorable to the stock market, and credit tightened further. For safety's sake, the bulls all unloaded their positions, leading to a total collapse.</p>
<p>Yong'an Textile opened at 16,770 yuan in the morning, down 280 yuan from yesterday's opening. Confidence was scattered, and small investors had no intention of holding on, giving up en masse. Numbers 228, 69, 76, 89, and 65 were sold down to 16,550 yuan. Subsequently, numbers 220, 121, 134, and 83 showed some interest in buying, pushing the price back up to 16,950 yuan. The bulls seized the opportunity to sell off, and securities firms sold a lot. Merchants from Guangdong also came to support the selling, and the market fell again to 16,550 yuan. Although numbers 29, 43, 101, and 228 helped to maintain the price, pushing it back up to 16,700 yuan, the environment was unfavorable. Large short-sellers watched and did not move, and speculative shorts increased rather than decreased. Funds from North China decreased, and credit tightened further. Numbers 155, 116, 4, 65, 220, 106, 102, and 51 came to sell aggressively again, causing a sharp drop below the 16,000 yuan mark. Although some speculative shorts covered at lower prices, briefly pushing the price back up to 16,630 yuan, it was only a fleeting moment. Near noon, the Hong Kong exchange rate lengthened, and prices outside the market fell across the board. The already weak market could not withstand another blow. Under siege on all sides, the market became even weaker. Yong'an Textile finally closed at 15,900 yuan. Mei Ya opened at 700 yuan, reaching a high of 715 yuan and a low of 645 yuan. Xin Guang and Jingfu also tended to weaken. As a result, compared to the previous close, Yong'an Textile, Mei Ya, Xinhe, Xin Guang, Jingfu, Match, China Silk, Huadong, and Zhabei fell by more than half and about 10%. Except for Xinyi Pharmaceutical Factory, which rose by more than half, the rest all fell. Unlisted stocks outside the market generally held up well due to demand.</p>
<p>Government Bonds</p>
<p>Became more popular due to rumors of peace negotiations. Unified Class C opened at 2.17 million yuan. Although it once fell back to a low of 2.1 million yuan, demand exceeded supply, and Rooms 550, 503, 500, and 360 all rushed to buy, creating a new high price of 2.12 million yuan. Chengde Room 552 sold off slightly, then closed at 2.26 million yuan. As a result, Unified Class C rose sharply by 200,000 yuan, Class E rose by 250,000 yuan, and Classes A and B also rose by 60,000 yuan.</p>

<h3>Olympic Flame Extinguished, 14th World Games Close, USA Wins Basketball Championship</h3>
<p>[United Press London Fourteenth Dispatch] The 14th World Games closed today. The traditional closing ceremony was held at Wembley Stadium, with an added touch of international goodwill. The five-ring World Games flag slowly descended from the flagpole, and at the same time, the World Games flame was extinguished. The World Games program will reappear in 1952 in Helsinki, the capital of Finland. Representatives and flag bearers from various countries stood in a semicircle behind the platform of honor. Military music played loudly, and flags were raised on the three flagpoles in the center of the stadium. First, the Greek flag was raised on the right, and the band played the Greek national anthem to commemorate the country of origin of the World Games. Next, the British flag was raised in the center, and the entire stadium sang "God Save the King." Finally, the Finnish flag, the host country of the next World Games, was raised on the left pole, and the Finnish national anthem was also played. The President of the International World Games Committee, Mr. Euslong, gave a speech, saying: "On behalf of the International World Games Committee, I express my respect to the King and people of England, as well as to the authorities of the City of London and the organizers of the competition. I declare that the 14th World Games has ended, and I call on the youth of the world to reunite in Helsinki in four years." After the World Games flag was lowered, it was handed over to the Mayor of London, who will hand it over to Finland in four years. The trumpeters of the King's Royal Cavalry played a farewell song, and a 5-gun salute was fired. As the choir sang the World Games song, the World Games torch was extinguished. The flag bearers also dispersed in the music. As dusk approached, the World Games stadium was empty.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper Report] London 14th Broadcast: The closing ceremony of the World Games was held today. Wembley Stadium was packed with 82,000 spectators, a scene as grand as the opening ceremony.

<p>[French News Agency London Fourteenth Dispatch] The formal closing ceremony of the World Games was held in the evening of the fourteenth, and the Olympic torch, which was taken from Greece and lit on July 29th, was extinguished. The athletes' achievements could not reach the expected record, mainly because of the poor weather. After several days of sudden heat, it was followed by overcast rain, and the temperature in the last few days was no different from severe winter. The most successful this time was the American World Games delegation, which did not fall behind in any sport. The scores of other countries were limited to a small number of sports, unlike the average development of the United States.</p>

The Southern team counterattacked, and center Babair rushed into the net, tying the score. The first half ended in a tie. After regrouping, Noda scored another goal in the 15th minute, giving Sweden the lead for the second time. Fifteen minutes later, Noda returned with a vengeance. Just as he was about to charge straight into the dragon's lair in front of the goal, a Yugoslav defender suddenly broke out and knocked Noda down. The British referee, Mr. Lin, enforced the law impartially and awarded a penalty kick. Noda was injured, and Gran took the penalty kick, scoring in one fell swoop and securing the victory with a score of 3-1.</p>

<h3>The Education Bureau Convened a Symposium on Tuition Fee Issues Yesterday, Collected Opinions and Drafted a Plan, and Unanimously Demanded that Educational Funding be Increased in Accordance with the Constitution</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Report] The Municipal Education Bureau held a symposium on tuition fee issues at Yucai Middle School yesterday afternoon at 4:00 PM. More than 100 people were invited to attend, including principals, teachers, staff, parents, and people from the education sector from public and private primary and secondary schools. The meeting was enthusiastically discussed, and the Education Bureau will summarize the opinions of all parties and formulate a specific plan for the collection of fees for public and private secondary schools in the next semester, which will be submitted to the next meeting for discussion and then reported to Mayor Wu for decision.</p>
<p>The Meaning of the Symposium: First, Education Bureau Director Li Ximou explained the meaning of convening the symposium, believing that the tuition fee issue for the next semester is quite serious, and hoping that attendees will abandon their prejudices when discussing and contribute their opinions while taking into account the difficulties of schools, teachers, staff, and parents. Director Li also reported that according to the Education Bureau's statistics, the fee standards for private primary schools in the previous semester were 2 million yuan, junior high schools were 3.6 million to 3.84 million yuan, and senior high schools were 4 million to 4.8 million yuan, when the cost of living index was 87,000 times. The staff index for the second half of July is now 1.5 million times. If calculated based on this cost of living index ratio, then the private elementary school should be 37 million next semester, the junior high school should be 71.4 million and the senior high school should be 89.2 million. However, this standard is calculated based on the index for the second half of July, not the index for the start of school in each school. Director Li also reported that the collection of miscellaneous fees by private schools should also be restricted, and the government will follow the British method and try to subsidize private schools with difficult economic situations.</p>
<p>Using Physical Objects as Standards: Jiang Wenyu believes that the fee standards can be based on physical objects, or handled with reference to the pre-war private school fee figures multiplied by the cost of living index. Tai Shuangqiu said that it is necessary to formulate a formula for fee standards, first calculate how much it should cost for a teacher's family of five to live, calculate based on 50 people per class, remove 20% for free places and 20% for administrative expenses, and calculate the teacher's salary at 3 shi of rice per month, then each student should pay about 8 dou of rice. Tai also advocated that at least one-third of the special contributions raised for relief should be used to subsidize schools in Shanghai, especially private schools.</p>
<p>Continuing Education Fee Issue: Representatives of municipal primary school teachers and staff requested that the teacher continuing education fee continue to be collected next semester. Representatives of private secondary school teachers and staff hoped that fees would be collected according to the price increase ratio based on the fee standards of 1936. Municipal teachers and staff believe that the fee standards for both public and private schools should be based on school expenses and the living standards of teachers, and should be borne separately by the government and students' parents. Teachers' salaries should be calculated according to the cost of living index based on the standards of the first half of 1937.</p>
<p>Asking the Government for Money: Legislator Chuan Tongxian first reported that the education funding in this year's national budget has been increased by more than 450 billion yuan after much effort, of which 30% is for national education funding, 30% subsidizes private schools, 30% provides relief to students in the pacification zone, and 10% subsidizes the descendants of meritorious soldiers. Therefore, local governments can legally and reasonably strive for funding from the central government. Fu believes that today there is only a way to ask the government for money to handle education affairs.</p>
<p>Parent Gu Shusen believes that the lives of teachers should be stable and their treatment should not be reduced due to tuition fee issues. The fee standard should also be reduced so that general parents can afford it. In addition, there was a unanimous request to increase educational funding to the amount stipulated in the Constitution.</p>
<h3>Private Vocational Schools' Tuition and Miscellaneous Fees for the Next Semester: 3.5 Shi of White Rice</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Report] The principals of various private vocational schools in the city held a symposium at the Hong Kong Road Bank Club at 3:00 PM yesterday afternoon. More than 10 people attended, including Tang Wenzhi of Wuxi National College, Pan Xulun of Lixin Accounting College, Wang Yukai of Guangxia Commercial College, Liu Haisu of Shanghai Art College, and Chen Gaoyong of China New College. It was resolved that the tuition and miscellaneous fee standards for various vocational schools in the city for the next semester will be uniformly 3.5 shi of white rice, and paid in legal tender converted according to the rice price reported on the day of the start of school. The registration deadline will be fixed and will not change. For late registration and payment, the rice price reported on the day of payment will be used for conversion.</p>
<p>In addition, the presidents of various private universities in the city are scheduled to meet on the 24th of this month to discuss the tuition fee issue for the next semester. It is reported that the general standard will be 4 shi of white rice.</p>
<h3>Representatives of Northeastern Students Petitioned the Ministry of Education Yesterday</h3>

<h3>Preventable Natural Disasters</h3>
<p>— Sun Jialin</p>
<p>This time, the Yongbei Underwear Factory on Baoshan Road suffered a "lightning strike," which touched the motor wires, causing a major fire disaster. Of the 103 workers in the closed factory, 63 died, and more than 20 were lightly and seriously injured. The boss and the boss's wife also died. Everyone mourns in unison and sighs that it was a "bolt from the blue." In fact, half of this disaster was self-inflicted. The reason why "Heaven" wanted to "strike" the Yongbei Underwear Factory was to punish their negligence and ignorance!</p>
<p>Tall buildings and huge chimneys must be equipped with complete lightning rods; power lines such as motors must be equipped with ground wires; all live wires must be completely insulated, and those that are old and have exceeded their limit should be replaced; these are not very profound common sense. The architects and engineers of the factory should have paid attention to implementing them long ago. The boss came from an apprenticeship and did not receive higher education, so he may lack common sense. Their negligence and ignorance destroyed themselves and killed innocent workers!</p>
<p>"Natural disasters" are sometimes actually "man-made disasters" that can be prevented and mitigated. Don't be superstitious about "inevitable disasters," let alone blame "fate." If the Yongbei factory had been equipped with good lightning rods and well-insulated wires, the "lightning strike" and power outage would not have occurred. These nearly 100 lives and hundreds of billions of assets were sacrificed in vain!</p>
<p>A word to the managers of all factories: Prevention of accidents requires constant attention at all times; bosses should also not be too stingy with money and continue to force old wires to continue to be used. Learn from the past and be careful in the future, mend the fold after the sheep is lost, so as to avoid accidents.</p>
<h3>Neighborly Encounters with Jews</h3>
<p>— Yu Jianhua</p>
<p>As a child, reading Shakespeare's "The Merchant of Venice" left me with a profound impression of the cunning and ruthlessness of Jews. Later, I heard of various vices attributed to them. Thus, an illusion formed in my mind, believing that all Jews were insidious, despicable, and solely motivated by profit.</p>
<p>After victory, returning to Shanghai from Fujian, I was introduced by a friend to rent a place on Changyang Road in Tilanqiao, Hongkou, an area where Jews congregated. Although many have been successively repatriated to America, there were still quite a few Jews living in the same apartment building and lane. Especially in the lane, there was a cafe and a small private garden, which were places for Jews to relax and cool off. As we got to know each other over time, I had more contact with them, and gradually felt that Jews were not as detestable as rumored. Although I had no way to know the inner layers of Jewish life, from the surface, there was nothing to criticize. Their cleanliness and health were far superior to those of the Chinese. Most people were generous and polite, and spent money quite freely. As for those who were meticulous and solely motivated by profit, they were rare.</p>
<p>Most of the Jews living nearby were driven out of Germany by Hitler. The men were mostly tall and well-built, with a German air (some were short, probably of a different kind). The women were mostly slender when young, but after middle age, they became extremely obese, even bloated and clumsy, with waists like five-stone urns. Both men and women dressed neatly and exquisitely, in high-quality materials. The women liked colorful clothes, and even old women with wrinkled skin and white hair still applied powder and wore colorful clothes, looking as glamorous as young women. Those who were unmarried or married without children often kept a dog, which accompanied them in and out, and was highly cherished. When they had children, the dog disappeared. Infants were always placed in exquisitely beautiful baby carriages, pushed to the garden by their father or mother, and never seen being held in arms. Jewish infants were round, fair-skinned, and like "foreign dolls," extremely cute. They gradually deteriorated as they grew older, and by the time they reached ten, their mischief exceeded that of Chinese children. Jews liked outdoor life, and very few stayed at home. Even in severe winter or hot summer, they had to go out, and even when strolling, they walked briskly, as if they had important matters. Although some of the Jews living nearby were engaged in small-scale commerce and industry, most of them were idle all day long. Although prices were high, they were content and did not feel any economic pressure. It was said that the unemployed were subsidized by the Jewish Federation, with ten US dollars per person per month, a set of clothing, and a box of food. This money was donated by American Jews, so their lives were very comfortable. There were also special ships to transport them back to America, and everything on board was free. Now more and more people are returning to America. The lane where I live was originally all Jews, but now only half remain. They mostly use German with each other, and English with the Chinese. Very few can speak Chinese. Therefore, Chinese merchants in nearby stores, small vegetable markets, and street stalls who collected old goods and repaired shoes all knew simple English and German. Whenever Jews bought things, the price was necessarily higher than for Chinese, which was taken for granted. It seems that the Chinese means of profiting are no weaker than those of the Jews. And the contempt for Jews that I had cultivated since childhood has gradually changed imperceptibly.</p>
<h3>Luxurious Prison</h3>
<p>— Jin Lin</p>
<p>The judicial community considers the prison in Greenwich Village, New York, to be the most comfortable prison in the world, with the women's prison in particular being called a "luxurious prison" because the female prisoners there live more comfortably than the poor villagers nearby. Each cell has hot and cold water faucets, and there is a circulating library, with guards pushing carts full of novels to the cells. The prison also has a rotating altar in the chapel. During services, first the Protestant service is held, then at the push of a button, the altar rotates to the Catholic service, and with another rotation, the Jewish service. Prisoners in the prison have absolute freedom of religion.</p>
<h3>Anecdotes of Old Man Xu Lü</h3>
<p>— Chen Zuogao</p>
<p>Time flies, prosperity and decline alternate, and it has been seven years since the Old Man Xu Yuan passed away. Every time I unfold his paintings, I think of his deeds. The old man's given name was Tongyu, his courtesy name was Shengzhi, also known as Wenruo, and Xu Yuan was his pseudonym. He was from Yuanhe, Jiangsu, and was a Hanlin scholar in the late Qing Dynasty. He was skilled in all four styles of calligraphy, especially cursive script and small regular script. His landscapes followed the styles of the Song and Yuan dynasties, with meticulous layouts, which were admired by those in the know. He first stayed at Wu Kezhai's residence, where he had a full view of ancient artifacts, calligraphy, and paintings, which he studied repeatedly for a long time. Later, he served as an official in the capital and became friends with Wu Yusheng, Ye Changchi, and Jiang Biao, discussing literature every month. In Suzhou, he, along with Kezhai, Gu Linzhi, Zheng Wenzhuo, and others, formed the Shujin Society in Yi Garden, with Old Man Xu effectively in charge. With such extensive knowledge, how could his artistic achievements not surpass those of his predecessors? It is said that Wu Hufan once saw a portrait of Nian Gengyao and said that the upper part of the old man's face closely resembled it, while the lower part resembled Zuo Zongtang. Therefore, his appearance was imposing and not at all like that of a weak scholar.</p>
<p>The old man also excelled in mathematics and physics. In the Jiaxu year, he served in the Surveying and Mapping Bureau, which was attached to the Manufacturing Bureau, and thus had access to insights into surveying and mechanical science. During the Sino-Japanese War in the Guangxu period, Kezhai's subordinate, General Wei Guangtao, was unable to operate the new cannons. Knowing that the old man was well-versed in this field, he invited him to take charge, and he hit the target every time, repeatedly contributing to the effort. Later, he successively held the positions of Director of Education in Jiangxi and Hubei, advocating practical learning, and many talents emerged. People like Ju Juesheng, Liu Yusheng, Dan Ming, Zhang Zhiben, and He Chengjun all came from his tutelage. During his tenure in Hubei, the famous scholar Liang Fengfen, who had impeached Li Hongzhang, was dismissed and served as the head of the Lianghu Academy for many years. His friends Zhang Zhidong and others repeatedly petitioned for his reinstatement, but to no avail. The old man then used the year-end evaluation precedent to rank Ding Fen as excellent, and was able to obtain approval for his reinstatement. His thirst for talent is evident here. After the Guihai year, he and You Xianjia founded the Suzhou Chamber of Commerce, and with Lu Yuanding, established a school, innovating politics and education everywhere, and his contributions cannot be denied. Commentators praised his innovative thinking, which was not accidental.</p>
<p>In the early years of the Republic of China, he chose a site near Xiancha Bridge in Nanxiang, naming his residence Cha Nan Cottage, closing his doors and sweeping the floor, and indulging in painting and calligraphy. However, he continued to cultivate younger generations, as he had done when he was Director of Education in Hubei, with particular expectations for Wu Hufan, Gu Qizhi, Yuan Anpu, and Chen Julai. To this day, they have all achieved success, demonstrating his profound vision, not like ordinary people.</p>
<p>When he turned eighty, his students Ju Juesheng and He Chengjun and others separately offered a birthday screen with their names jointly inscribed, along with four thousand yuan in ceremonial money, and personally toasted him, wishing him boundless longevity. He publicly declined the cash gift, remaining composed and unconcerned, demonstrating his integrity and unconventional spirit. He wrote several volumes of "Xu Yuan's Notes," "Diary," and "Collection of Poems and Essays." He also urgently gathered and recorded his works, completing any unfinished characters. Years ago, Mr. Gu Qiqian published his collection and wrote his biography, and the old man's reputation will be further spread far and wide.</p>
<h3>Jia Sidao's Abandoned Residence</h3>
<p>— Shi Shufan</p>
<p>Jia Sidao's mansion is located north of Miaoshan in Tiantai City. The remains of the abandoned site are very extensive, with half occupied by poor households and half cultivated with millet. Local elders can still tell its story in detail. After Sidao's defeat, his entire family was ashamed and changed their surname to Ye. Therefore, there are no more Jias between Chicheng and Huading. During his lifetime, he wrote a book on crickets, which is still kept in the Ye Ancestral Hall in the western countryside, but his descendants are very secretive about it. Chen Jialin once glanced at it and said that the writing was very delicate, just like his poems. The book lists names such as "Black Head General," which are the titles bestowed on the bravest crickets. I once commented that Qiu He had some talent, but he was fond of accumulating wealth and jealous of talent, and he was in a precarious situation, so he could not avoid his fate. If he were alive today, he could travel far and wide with his wealth, and there would be no obstacles. Why would he have to die in the Kapok Nunnery? When I was stationed in that country, every time I passed Xilian, I seemed to see it and recorded my feelings.</p>
<p>Moss covers the abandoned foundation, and the Jiao Ma Pond is a desolate bay. "Autumn Cricket" is a good name, but how can it send the country away?</p>
<p>Millet grows in rows in front of the door, who says it's not the Prime Minister's residence? The moon rises over the melon shed surrounding the old man, and right and wrong still lie with the Zhao family.</p>
<p>How could he bear to be intimate with the deer and pigs in the deep mountains? My heart aches for my ancestors who were powerful ministers! It is proposed to seal the three volumes of the Cricket Classic, so that there are no Jias within a hundred miles.</p>
<p>He waved gold powder and corrupted the southeast, and died unhappily because of his dissoluteness. Floating on the sea and riding the clouds is common today, alas, he turned and turned in the Kapok Nunnery.</p>
<h3>The Public Sacrifice for Peace</h3>
<p>— Shi Feng</p>
<p>It's the time for the public sacrifice for peace again. Although in recent decades, due to the progress of the times and the influence of new science, most people have felt that the sacrifice is boring and wasteful, and have vigorously advocated its abolition, a group of merchants and residents without new ideas and full of superstition still have boundless faith in the sacrifice, firmly believing that it can save the dead and protect the peace of the population, willing to spend countless money, stubbornly refusing to be enlightened!</p>
<p>A few days ago, several people came to my house with yellow booklets to raise donations, declaring that at least one million yuan should be donated. I couldn't help but be shocked. Doing other good deeds, such as donating scholarships, donating funds for mobile medical vehicles, and donating to the Pushan Villa, which are very meaningful and can actually benefit those in distress, are still done willingly, and the amount doesn't matter. I didn't expect that this "good deed" purely for ghosts and spirits would set a limit, and one must donate a certain amount, which is really absurd!</p>
<p>Yesterday outside the alley, a high canopy was erected, and paper clothes, paper pants, and paper ingots tied with straw ropes fluttered in the wind. Countless paper-made ghosts and monsters were erected around, and dozens of Taoist priests were noisily playing music. In the evening, there was still a constant noise of gongs and drums, making it impossible for the surrounding residents to sleep. Today it continues, and tonight a large batch of paper items will be burned. I am really worried about a fire! It is said that this time the cost will be more than 500 million (of course, the people involved will have considerable benefits). I think, if this 500 million spent on music and fire could be donated to charitable organizations or educational institutions, directly helping society, wouldn't it be much more meaningful?</p>
<p>Those who still believe in ghosts and monsters should have been eliminated by the times long ago. For inner peace, it is better to have some real compassion and help those poor people who are sick and have no money for treatment, and those students who are ambitious but have no way to study! And since our police authorities have the courage to remove stone statues, they should pay more attention to this behavior of collecting money under the guise of false sacrifices?</p>

<p>The merchants and residents of old Beijing have a special kind of humor. No matter how unstable the world is, no matter how poor the circumstances, they can often show a leisurely attitude if they have not reached the final stage. The local customs and human feelings of the north are different from those of central and southern China in terms of stillness and restlessness. Even the repeated increases in the value of "paper money" and the troubles of life have turned from surprise to numbness, and from numbness to bitter laughter. The metamorphosis of the nerves can also reflect the general phenomenon.</p>
<p>In the market, the word "wan" (ten thousand) is omitted in transactions. For example, an item worth 300,000 is referred to as "thirty". This can be applied to other numbers. However, for numbers less than ten, such as "jiu wan" (nine ten thousand), "ba wan" (eight ten thousand), and all the way down to "yi liang wan" (one or two ten thousand), the word "wan" is still used, because a single-digit number only has one sound, which is not convenient to say. Therefore, the word "wan" is only used to complete the pronunciation. But sometimes they are called "ji ge zi er" (several zi er) or "ji ge da" (several da)! For example, those who sell sliced watermelon shout "wu ge zi er yi da kuai" (five zi er for a big slice), "san ge zi er yi xiao kuai" (three zi er for a small slice). The so-called "zi er" refers to 10,000 yuan bills or 500 Customs Gold Unit bills, borrowing from the old term "tong yuan" (copper coin)'s "zi er" (copper zi er, like what is called copper plates or copper jiaozi in the south). Similarly, those who sell bean juice, wo tou (steamed corn bread), and small snacks shout "ji ge da yi wan" (several da for a bowl), "ji ge da yi kuai" (several da for a piece), also referring to "wan". In the old cash era, one cash was called one da, which is even more quaint.</p>
<p>Currently, "wan" is still the unit of calculation ("qian" (thousand) has become a thing of the past, and "yi" (hundred million) is on the horizon). The face value of legal tender notes stops at 10,000 yuan, which is the largest bill in terms of legal tender, but it is becoming increasingly rare, only used for small transactions or small change. In addition to this, although so-called tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands, and tens of millions refer to legal tender, the actual transactions all involve "Guan Laoye" (Old Master Guan - Customs Gold Unit). (In old cities, people often called Customs Gold Units "Guan Laoye" because shops in the north were accustomed to worshiping Guan Yu as the god of wealth, with two large basins of gold ingots and silver ingots in front of his portrait, because it was popularly said that Cao Cao treated Guan Yu favorably, giving him gold when he mounted his horse and silver when he dismounted, and dramas and novels also had the "Guan Yunchang Hanging Up His Seal and Sealing Gold" episode, so "Guan Jin" (Customs Gold) was said to be "Guan Gong's Gold", which was also a fun association. As for the meaning of "Custom gold units", it is beyond the understanding of those people.)</p>
