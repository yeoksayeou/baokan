<h3 id="c1">英使與王外長懇切磋商　九龍城案可望解決　監委建議政府收回港九 <a href="#c1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>〔本報南京十五日電〕關於九龍城問題，英大使諦文十五日晚與王外長再度懇切磋商，聞雙方意見已趨接近，在維持中國立塲之條件下，此事可望覓得合理解決辦法。</p>
<p>〔本報南京十五日電〕九龍城事件十五日無重要發展，英大使館迄仍未接奉倫敦方面之任何訓示。外部歐洲司長尹葆宇，曾於晨十一時接見英大使館參事雷博濟，再度商談關於九龍城事件各項問題。尹氏當向雷氏提出九龍城被捕居民代表朱沛唐，劉毅夫二人被香港法庭越權判處苦役事，鄭重要求英令香港政府翻譯該二居民，並促英方迅即接受王外長前向施諦文大使提出之各項要求，以保持中英友好關係。關於九龍城管轄權問題，雷氏仍持原意，但爲中英友誼計，允將我方要求轉請英大使即電達倫敦政府。</p>
<p>〔中央社南京十五日電〕監察院十五日晨十時舉行監委談話會，討論九龍城事件。會後監委何漢文，俞奮，黃鳳池，于樹德，梅公任等廿八人聯名提出「尅期收回香港·九龍」之建議案。其原文如下：「滿清末葉，政治腐敗，列強乘危，紛紛侵佔我國領土主權，英國于雅片戰後，迫我割讓香港。一八九八年六月九日復迫我租借九龍，以圖伸張香港之統治範圍及其對於華南侵略勢力。抗戰勝利以後，以我國八年之英勇苦鬥，國際地位增高各國對於中國無寄以深切之同情，乃均將百年來先後與中國所訂各種不平等條約紛紛自動取消，所有租界及租借地亦均先後收回，而英國以囿於殖民地之利益，對前以侵略手段割取之香港及租借之九龍，雖經我國再三據理交涉，迄未允予歸還。近復變本國厲，香港政府當局竟勒令九龍舊城中國居民拆遷房屋。本月五日港九警察竟武裝進入租界外之九龍城內強拆房屋，並逮捕居民代表，擅判苦役。至十二日晨，復悍然射擊中國居民，以至民憤沸騰。我國政府外交當局亦向英國政府提出嚴重抗議。查一八九八年中英兩國政府所締之九龍半島租借條約，規定租借地以九十九年爲期，歸英國管轄，但九龍城區仍爲中國之完整領土，並不在租借之列。中國官員仍可在城執行職務，居民仍可繼續住居營業，大鵬·深洲二洋面，中國兵艦仍可使用。英國此次在九龍之暴行，不惟違背租借條約，且顯爲侵略中國主權之新行動，益以香港與九龍租借地存在之關係，各種違法反抗政府之份子與團體均以此爲依附，一切走私均以香港九龍爲活動根據地，香港政府亦陰爲庇護。揆之事實，英國政府旣以侵略手段攫取香港九龍於先，今復以強暴行爲對待我居民於後，我國政府自應重新決定對策。戰後我國所受一切不平等條約旣經先後取消，香港割奪與九龍強租之侵略餘毒，自不能容其繼續存在。委員等謹依法建議，請政府即日以有效手段，收回香港，廢止中英九龍半島租借條約，收回九龍半島，並林求英國政府賠償我居民因此次非法行動所受之一切損失，如英國仍繼續有如前之事態發生，我政府即應一面以武力保護居民，一面進行強硬之交涉。」（其他有關九龍事件消息刊版一欄）</p>
<p>〔合眾社南京十五日電〕民主社會黨領袖徐傳霖十五日評論香港政府勒令中國居民退出九龍城行動，係英人之恥。渠建議政府與香港斷絕交通三月，作爲抗議。青年黨發言人指香港爲帝國主義之殘餘，要求政府收回該島主權。</p>

<h3 id="c24">軍事重心在北方 <a href="#c24" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e24" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">24</a></h3>
<p>新春以來，東北及華北的戰亂，並未能因天寒地凍而稍趨緩和，共匪反而在冰天雪地之中，加緊進攻；在東北方面，共匪對於瀋陽，曾發動第七次的攻勢，來勢凶猛，幸賴我忠勇的將士，在遼西彰武，新立屯一綫，擊虧共匪的右翼，使其七次攻勢復成泡影。這幾天來戰事雖較沉寂，但是仍呈外馳內張的局勢。共匪的主力，現正自西安，梅河口，清原三角地區，移向法庫。新民。等地，企圖威脅北寗路，從而圍攻瀋陽。此在華北，戰火也曾一度延及天津的外圍，在其東南的重要據點小站，也曾一度被共匪突入，共匪並企圖乘勢進擾塘沽，但經國軍三晝夜的苦戰，卒將小站收復，解除了天津外圍的威脅。惟共匪進擾的野心未死，仍在那裏蠢蠢欲動，所以華北的危機尚未眞正消除，我們雖不願否認局勢的嚴重性，但沒有喪失我們對於剿匪戡亂的信心。</p>
<p>蔣主席曾於本月十日飛平轉瀋，已將東北及華北的戰局，可望於最短期內走錯於穩定。而且剿匪戡亂的軍事行動，勢必有進無退；從全國性的觀點而論，最近有陸軍訓練會議的召開，由蔣主席親自主持，决定將全國分為八個新兵訓練的中心，北平·瀋陽，也是八個中心之一：若就東北華北而言，統帥部移往北平之說，日來其囂麈上；而且國軍為確保北寗路的交通及肅清冀熱遼邊區共匪起見，决在遼西設一指揮機構，由范漢傑將軍負責指揮。所以新任河北省政府主席楚溪春最近曾表示：「國軍决不能放棄長吉，北寗路卽將打通」。這兩句話，决非虛語，在最近的將來，卽可有事實來證明。</p>
<p>我們環觀全國的戰局，目前軍事的重心，仍在北方（包括東北及華北）。記得去春共匪原有「確保東北，鞏固華北，發展華中」的狂妄野心，一年以來，共匪劉伯承，陳賡，陳毅的部隊，在華中東竄西竄，企圖實行其所謂「發展華中的陰謀；誰都知道，華中是政府的心贓，若成了共匪的流竄區，關係整個局勢自極嚴重；但自國防部九江指揮所成立後，將華中的軍事歸白崇禧將軍一人負責指揮，因此所有的困難，也就克服了。最近共匪因為流竄的計劃失敗，遷怒於美國，竟屠殺美國女敎士；僅從這一點，也就可以看出劉伯承，陳賡，陳毅之流的部隊，東西澈竄屠殺老百姓，固然有餘，但欲發展華中。决不會成事的。所以我們認為今日軍事的重心，仍在北方，我們要請讀者密切注視北方戰局的發展。並須知北方剿匪軍事的得失，和整個戡亂建國的前途，關係太重大了。若干失敗主義者製造棄東北的謠言，實不值讀者之一笑。</p>
<p>最近中樞曾通飭部隊注意，重視經濟據點。這實在是戡亂事中最有價值的指示。共匪自抗戰勝利以來所採取的策略，一言以蔽之，乃在「稱兵作亂」四字，除了以武力擴大其地盤而外，並欲破壞國內的交通，使全國的生產均陷於停頓，從而促成政府在金融經濟方面的潰崩，美國國務卿馬歇爾來華調處，未及一月，就看破共匪欲以戰亂的方式拖垮政府的陰謀。所以在政府方面，對於剿匪戡亂唯一的正本清源的辦法，端在軍事與經濟方面，雙管齊下，相輔而行，始能事半功倍；甚至還可以說，經濟上的戡亂，比較軍事尤為重要，我們看了政府最近的指示，更可信而有徵了。</p>
<p>凖此而論北方的經濟價值，例如的大豆，平津的煤礦，石家莊之棉花，許昌的烟葉，以及山東的小麥等等，對於國計民生，都是機關重要的物資，國軍必須重視爭取：共匪所以要「確保東北，鞏固華北」，其看眼之點，也就在此。所以國軍此後，必須貫澈這個指示的目的。唯其如此，我們預料今後一二月北方的戰爭，必為爭取棉花之戰。據專家估計，去秋北方棉花收成，可有一千二百萬担，業經政府收購者，僅及三分之一，其餘三分之二，尚待搶購，此則有望於軍事力量的配合，自不待言。</p>
<p>要之，我們觀察全國大局的演進，不得不呼籲全國上下加緊進行剿匪戡亂的工作，國軍在目前的階段中，一方面要重視北方，東北華北都是我們的生命綫，决不可輕言放棄，老實說，沒有東北就沒有華北，沒有華北就沒有華中，我們千萬不能做失敗主義者，而想苟安於一時；此在另一方面，也要正視華中的危機，江·淮·河·漢，固然是一個廣大的平原；但是大別·大洪·桐柏·武當，也有不少的山嶺，可為共匪的逋逃藪，目前應該乘共匪在華中立足未穩之際，予以迎頭痛擊，積極方面，應將共匪加以圍殲；在消極方面，至少要鞏固江防，嚴戒川邊，務使共匪不能逞其渡江或入川擴大流軍的妄想。</p>

<p>至於老河口方面，因匪軍劉伯承部第十二師已渡過漢水，軍情日緊，該地外籍敎士均已集中，等待飛機撤往漢口，「聖保羅」號原定昨日飛抵老河口，現悉因技術問題，未成事實，因在一週之前，老河口軍用機塲之地面設備，業經拆移，聖保羅號之駕駛員認為在地面聯絡恢復之前，不宜冒險降落。數週以前，南京美駐華大使館曾向我國政府要求准許敎會專機降落老河口機塲，以便撤退敎士，當時以軍事關係，未獲同意，目前該區敎士之情況，已引起此間敎會之焦慮。</p>

<p>〔本報十五日南京電〕經濟改革方案財政部份實施辦法草案，業經擬定，茲錄誌如下：</p>
<p>一，整理財政</p>
<p>原方案（一）財政收支系統，應重予修訂，增加省級財源，期能自給，對於縣市法定稅課，並應切實整理，嚴禁非法攤派，藉使地方財政健全發展，適應地方建設之需要。</p>
<p>實施辦法：</p>
<p>甲，收支系統之修訂：</p>
<p>現行財政收支系統，係三級制，撥於本草案决定後，將全國財政收支劃分為中央財政與地方財政兩大系統。地方財政再分兩級，以（一）省及院轄市曁特別行政區域為一級，（二）縣及省轄或相當於縣市之設治避為一級，至中央及地方（省市）及縣（市局）稅源之劃分，在動員戡亂時間，仍暫依現行財政收支系統辦理，惟中央稅收擬將宜於提成撥補地方，或由地方代征者，提前劃歸地方（詳細辦法詳後），並擬就土地稅於行憲後全部劃歸地方，以增裕地方財源。</p>
<p>乙，省（市）級財政之充實：</p>
<p>（一）土地稅。土地稅宜於行憲後擬改為地方稅省縣各佔該項收入百分之五十，院轄市仍以百分之四十協濟中央，在行憲以前，仍為中央省縣共有稅，其劃分成數，仍按現行辦法辦理。（二）帶征公糧。帶證地方公糧，省縣擬各分配百分之五十，惟省應以所得之半數，作為統籌該省內各縣市盈虛之用。（三）營業稅。營業稅擬全部劃作省級財政，除省轄市仍應由分給五成外，免以五成分縣，在院轄市應協濟中央之成數，則擬在行憲以前仍照現行辦法辦理，在行憲以後，全部劃作院轄市之收入，並將其稅率分別提高，凡按營業收入額課證者，擬由百分之一，五提高為百分之三，凡按營業收益額課征者，擬由百分之四提高至百分之六。（四）契稅。擬將此項收入全部歸作縣市收入，其附加原屬縣市者改為省收入。（五）特別稅課。擬准院轄市就當地實際需要情形，依法開征特別稅課。</p>
<p>丙，縣級財政之整理：</p>
<p>縣級財政之整理，擬分三項着手分述如下：（子）稅收之增撥：（一）遺產稅。提高遺產稅撥補縣市之成數，其比率擬由百分之三十增至百分之七十，並規定縣市政府協助稽征之辦法。（二）土菸土酒稅。擬由中央委託縣市代征，並以其收入百分之五十撥補縣市，至其協助稽征之辦法亦擬即加釐訂。（丑）稅率之調整：（一）各項捐稅稅率。房捐營業牌照稅，使用牌照稅，屠宰稅，筵席捐，娛樂捐，契稅等各稅率，擬均分別提高，並改進其征收之方法。（此項詳細辦法，最近已由本部專案呈院奉准，現正完成立法程序中）（二）田賦賦率賦籍。調整田賦之賦率賦籍，藉以均負平賦，擠查異地，增加收入，此項方案，擬由本部會同糧食地政兩部會擬辦法，呈准施行。（寅）稅源之增　：</p>
<p>（一）特別稅課。凡人性解放習繳納或不損地方人民生機而可靠之捐稅，（如西北之牲畜稅，東南之海產，山區之藥材及特種農作物等）。擬准地方依照合法手續，准其沿辦或舉辦，並承認其為該地方之合法稅課</p>
<p>丁，鄉鎭財政之充實：</p>
<p>（一）設置保田。每保至少三十畝保田之收入，指定為鄉鎭保甲經費，以無主土地及依法征收之田地撥充之。（二）充實鄉鎭敎育經費，經民意機關通過舉辦學榖捐，並指定鄉鎭公有款產及造產收入百分之五十為鄉鎭敎育經費。（三）嚴格執行鄉鎭經費佔縣預算百分之五十以上之規定。</p>
<p>戍，非法攤派之禁止：</p>
<p>（一）各縣市應切實執行地方總預算，不得另有收支，如須舉辦地方新興事業，應先依法辦理收支追加預算，經呈准後方得施行。（二）凡不屬地方自治之事業，如經中央或省委託辦理者，其經費應由委託機關撥給。（三）凡非法定期征收機關不得逕向人民征收任何款物，違者依刑法第一二九條論處。（四）製訂縣市開闢特別稅課辦法，以限制地方攤派。</p>
<p>原方案（二）直·貨·關·鑒各稅稅率，應察酌人民納稅能力，切實調整，以增裕國庫收入，平均人民負担。</p>
<p>甲，直接稅稅率之調整</p>
<p>（子）所得稅之草，除第一類營利事業所得稅仍採全額累進稅率外，其餘二·三·四·五各類所得稅，一律改行比例稅率，以利征繳。（丑）所得稅起稅點及稅率，依照英國制度，於每年年度開始前，斟酌國民經濟情形，及國家財政需要擬定稅率，送請立法機關審議公布實施，藉以適應物價波動之情形，以及人民負担之能力。（寅）提高遺產稅起征點，并將稅率减輕，現行原稅法自百分之二累進至百分之六十之規定，擬改為自百分之一至百分之二十五。至關稅級距，擬予减少，自十七級减至八級，以利推行。（卯）提高印花稅定額率，擬高當時情形，酌予提高。（辰）改以收入額或以收益頗為課征特種營業稅之標準，俾收益豐厚之營業，使其負担較高之稅額，以平負担。</p>
<p>乙，貨物稅</p>
<p>（子）提高奢侈品稅率，貨物稅中，如捲烟，洋酒，土菸，土酒，錫箔迷信用紙，化妝品等，均屬奢侈品，現已從價征收百分之四十五至百分之百，此後尚擬觀物，價及商人負担能力，屆時調整；至麥粉·棉紗·煤鐵等·或係礦產品有關工業，原稅率雖均尚低微，擬暫不再中，以免刺激物價。</p>
<p>丙，關稅</p>
<p>（子）恢復征收汽油柴油進口稅，並將原訂柴油汽油及煤油進口稅率，一律增為從價百分之五十（此案業經呈准政院自三十六年十月一日起實施）。（丑）根據政府核定之關稅原則及世界貿易就業會議我國所接受之義務，修訂進口稅則，以謀關稅收入之中。</p>
<p>丁，鹽稅</p>
<p>（子）劃一稅率：鹽稅率勝利後為適應收復區各別環境，酌用等差率，曾達十餘種之多，迭經調整簡化，本年八月已再度調整，分類劃一，為普通食鹽每担十萬元，土膏鹽八萬元，全國一律，民負平均，稽征稱便，嗣後擬仍本此原則辦理。（丑）調整稅率：八月調整之新稅率，較戰前平均率約為一萬六千餘倍，仍不及物價之半，就人民納稅能力言，負担尚輕，嗣後擬察酌物價變動情形，人民納稅能力及庫支需要，配合統籌，於必要時續議調整辦法。</p>
<p>原方案（三）依照有錢出錢之原則，增闢新稅捐，以應建國之需要。</p>
<p>實施辦法：舉辦建國特捐，規定以中華民國國民個人為課征對象，個人所有財政總額在五十億以上者，起征稅率採金額累進制，自百分之十累進至百分之五十，辦理程度分申報提名，告密，調查，核課等項，由民意機關負責提名，地方有關機組織調查委員會負責調查估價，主管征收機關根據調查之財產實值，核課捐款原方案（四）調整徵收機構，嚴密控制稅源，改進稽手續，以加强稅政效率，减低徵收費用。</p>
<p>調整征收機構嚴密控制稅捐改進稽征手續，以加强稅政效率，减低征收費用。</p>
<p>實施辦法：</p>
<p>甲，機構之調整</p>
<p>Ａ，直接稅：（子）加强據點分局，充實人力稅源，不鹽征收費用，在稅收百分之卅以上之分局，一律併，以節開支。（丑）參酌稅收情形，裁併省區機構，最近貴州山東兩省稅源短絀，已將貴州區直接稅局與雲南合併為雲貴區直接稅局，山東區直接稅局與河南區合併為魯豫區直接稅局。</p>
<p>（Ｂ）貨物稅：（子）凡分局及縣辦公處收支比率超過百分之卅，駐廠塲礦人員收支比率超過百分之廿者，均隨時裁併設置，或核减員額，以省開支。（丑）參酌稅收情形，裁併省區機構，最近已將貴州區貨物稅局與雲南合併為雲貴區貨物稅局。</p>
<p>Ｃ關稅：為切合稽征需要及防止華南私運起見，擬將分支機構分別調整如下：（一）秦皇島所屬之葫蘆島分關，改隸營口關管轄。（二）台北關移設基隆。（三）改梧州關為支關歸粵海關管轄。（四）南寗關予以裁撤。（五）龍州支關升為總關。（六）北海支關升為總關。（七）於長江下游增設一支關，隸江海關管轄。（八）於九龍關因區內百色洲·鹽田·沙魚浦·南澳等地方增設支關四處，支所十一處，并於各支關間貨物衝要地區，設立守望所，專司瞭望，並查緝私鹽。（九）於香港外圍關灣地方，增設支關一處。（十）於澳門外圍青龍山地方，增設支關一處。</p>
<p>Ｄ鹽：（子）裁併查驗卡所。勝利後，鹽務政策即着重於棄實產區，緊縮銷區，查騐卡所盡量裁併，實施以來，已陸續裁併機構六百餘處。（丑）裁减銷區部隊。銷區緊縮後，原駐銷區之鹽警部隊，亦减少至最低限度。（未完待續）</p>

<h3 id="c48">西歐受援各國償還能力　美國務院提報告　分贈與貸款現金償還四類 <a href="#c48" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e48" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">48</a></h3>
<p>〔路透社華盛頓十四日電〕國務部今日　發表關於馬歇爾方案之新數字，涉及參加　方案每一國之進出口，生產，及政治狀態，但未透露美援資金之分配數額及方式。國務院官員並曰，彼等已　時決定對希臘，奧國之援助應爲購與方式；對英，法，義，荷，慮，丹，冰島之援助，部份爲體與部份爲貨與；對愛爾關，瑞典，挪威之援助爲借款方式；而對瑞士，葡萄牙，土耳其援助之物資須以規金償還。茲分述國務部報吿書所述及關於各國之部份如下：</p>
<p>英國：在援歐方案實施期及完成以後，英國之糧食衣着及汽油之定量配給，將繼續存在。英黃金美元資金現共約二十億元，至一九四八年底，將僅及其半，數年之內將織續有美元入超，英國之對外支付至一九五二年大約可望平衡。就食糧之　　言，至少至一九五二年始可恢復戰前水準，英國現行之管制制度，在一九五二年以前將繼續存在，而英鎊且可能貶値。關於政治方面，國務部認工黨與保守黨之外交政策，並無基本不同，工黨內部復有左傾與中間兩派之別，共產黨在英勢力至爲微弱，英海外屬領對於協助英國之恢復支付平衡極有　助。</p>
<p>法國：許曼政府與其政敵之奮門及其强力經濟政策之完成，苟無外援，在數年內難期成功。法議及西歐之關鍵，問題乃為將允法國經濟趨於崩潰，在紊亂中建立共產獨裁制度，抑將使民主勢力得以增强在西歐之基地？目前法政府處於喘息機會，此蓋由於戴高樂將軍不願在冬令期內重掌政權，以及許多議員在共黨實力未遭擊破前，尙未敢推翻中間政府之故。</p>
<p>希臘：國務部認為希臘現政府之合法代表性，實毫無可疑之處，遊聲隊中僅三分之一係真正的共產黨人，餘均亡命之徒，故若能削减遊擊隊之實力，建立內部安定，則希政府之經濟復典計劃及美國現所供給之援助，可為最低度復興之基礎，若能制止進聲隊活動，人民之生存水準，即可維持，共產主義係於戰後的紊亂狀熊中，始在希臘擴張，希臘苟獲穩固經濟及必要建設的基礎，即可保持獨立，維護自由血獨立的制度，但若人民黨或自由黨退出　前之聯合政府，穩定的政府殊　組織。</p>
<p>實施馬歇爾方案後　德人生活仍低落　英美合併區幣制改革勢在必行</p>
<p>德國：德國於馬歇爾方案實施完畢後，其生活標準將繼續在緊縮狀態中，消費數　仍將連低於戰前，僅菸草及食糖之舞人消費最，可望達到戰前水準百分之七十，肉類消費量，將僅及戰前之百分之六十，油脂消費量僅及戰前之百分之四十。報吿書復曰，德境英美區內，必須採用新貨幣，以大量减少紙幣之流通量，如四强不獲改革全德幣制之協議，英美區之幣制改革勢在必行。</p>
<p>義大利：國務部認爲他國吸收義大利利利過剩的人力，為其經濟安定之必要條件，義經濟困難之主因，在於人口之激增，糧食供應之缺乏，通貨膨脹及失業普遍，關於政治方面，國務部認爲最近義國中間政治勢力之增強，實緣人民對共黨策動之動亂及蘇聯所採之若干不友好行動發生反感之故，然溫和派義政府之權　存在，仍有賴於改良其嚴軍的經濟局勢。</p>
<p>土耳其：土國未受戰火波及，而其政府內部對於外交政策之意見復能保持一致，故其所面臨之經濟復興問題，與大部份歐州國家不同。自一九四五年以來土國迭受外界壓力，使政府不得不保持六十萬長備軍，因此引起嚴重的財政及人力問題，預料馬歇爾方案實施完成以後，土國對外貿易可望大　超出，其在援助方案下獲得之輸入品亦不難以現金償還。</p>

<p>我們只要回憶第一次世界大戰發源於歐洲大陸，第二次世界大戰也是以歐洲作爲最主要戰塲之一，就可以想像到雖在世界金融中心國際聯合組機都已經搬到紐約的今日，歐洲大陸仍不失其國際政治重要舞台的地位。鑒諸往而知來者，我們檢討一九四七年的歐局，多少可以增進我們對於一九四八年乃至今後的歐陸以及世界政局的認識。</p>
<p>照常理來講，一九四七年應該是歐陸很重要的一年，因爲在這一年中，它應當爲歐洲大陸奠定一個長期和平的基礙。而在事實上，不論是否做到道一點，歐陸在這一年中，確也有若干不平凡的事實，我們先替它做一個簡單的「大事記」。</p>
<p>一九四七年三月十日至四月廿四日，英美蘇法四國外長集會於莫斯科，討論對德對奧問題，無結果而散。</p>
<p>六月五日，美國務卿馬歇爾在哈佛演說，說明美國經濟援歐計劃。（此事與下列第八項雖均不發生於歐陸，但與歐陸有密切的關聯。）</p>
<p>七月十二日歐洲十六個國家舉行歐洲經濟合作會議於巴黎。</p>
<p>九月廿二日，歐洲各國經濟合作委員會報吿書簽訂於巴黎。</p>
<p>十月五日，國際共黨情報局式正宣布成立於貝爾格勒。</p>
<p>十一月廿五日，英美蘇法四國外長集會於倫敦，討論對德對奧問題，至十二月十五日，無給果而散。</p>
<p>十二月十七日，英美簽訂關於分配德國佔領區經費之協定。</p>
<p>十二月十九日，美國會通過馬歇爾經濟援歐計劃之緊急救濟部份。</p>
<p>十二月廿四日，希臘共黨宣布成立臨時政府，以反抗現在之希臘政府</p>
<p>十二月三十日，羅馬尼亞國王米契爾宣布退位，羅馬尼亞成立「人民共和國。」</p>
<p>當然的，上面所列舉的，只是一九四七年中有關歐陸大事之一部份。他如法國內閣的閣潮與工潮，東歐各國的政治獄等等，我都無法一一記錄。但是，話說回來，僅僅這些，已經很够表示一九四七年歐洲大陸的局面。如果個別的觀察上舉的茶一事實，也許不甚重要，或者它的重要性不够明顯，如果把它聯擊起來，它的確反映了歐陸一年來局勢的主流所在。</p>
<p>純粹由事實的外表來看，歐陸的問題是以德國間題爲中忠。一再舉行的四國外長會議，也是以對德問題爲主題，而在對德問題之中，雖則包括了德國東部邊境問題，賠款問題，德國未來政府問題等等，實際上，最主要的是蘇聯希望有一個親蘇的或者說與目前若干東歐國家相類似的德國，英美則希望有一個接受所謂「西方文化」的德國。再進一步來看，在東歐巳經事實上成爲蘇聯勢力圈的今日，德國的前途，勢將決定歐陸的命運。這樣，對德問題不能解決，使美國與蘇聯相互猜疑之心日甚，一九四七年從春間四國外長會議無結果而散之後，雙方都在下棋。馬歇爾計劃的動機，也許是爲了防止歐洲赤化，也許是爲了美國渦剩生產力的出路，但是無論如何，他是要求一個安定的歐洲，而開啓一個國際合作之門。由於蘇聯及東歐各國之拒絕參加，確定了東西歐對立的壁壘，沿着這個馬歇爾計劃而發展的是西歐十六國的經濟會議。共黨情報局之成立，雖云是交換情報，實際上多少是第三國際之化身，同時亦所以對抗馬歇爾計劃。這些前奏，已經決定了十一月間四國外長倫敦會議失敗的命運，而倫敦會議的失敗，又促成英美在德國西部的合作與美國會之通過馬歇爾援歐計劃之緊急救濟部份。在這種情形之下，希臘共黨不論是受命的抑或自動的，也就乘着雙方集團日以形成之際，宣布成立政府，而羅馬尼亞國王也就在提早鞏固東歐局勢之下退位。這種的發展，很明白的是以美蘇為首的兩個集團對立明朗化。</p>
<p>這種局勢給與一九四八年以極劣的影響。一九四六年所沒有解決的問題，不但不能在一九四七年解決，為歐陸的和平奠定一個基礎，幷且它似乎把問題更加「僵化」。一九四七年春間之莫斯科會議，是事前早就決定的，而一九四七年冬間之倫敦會議，就未能替今年預定一個會議，道實在是一個極大的不幸。</p>
<p>回憶第一次世界大戰以後，雖則對於每一個國際問題的處理，不能書滿人意，幷且也沒有奠定和平的基礎，但是却沒有像今天這樣的僵局，主要的問題，不是因爲蘇聯代替了第一次大戰以後法國的地位。而是因為蘇聯由於特殊的信仰與經濟制度，使它希望有一個無限大的安全圈。如果由這一點出發來看一九四八年的歐陸，自然是一個很悲觀的前途。我們看到雙方已經公開的互相指責，實在使我們不能想像在一九四七年所不能解決的問題，可以在一九四八年解決。甚或有人害怕一九四八年會成為一九一四年或一九三九年。不過如果我們冷靜的一想，一九四八年可能是很僵局的一年，但是如果說是會發生全球性的戰爭，那也未免太悲觀。第一，蘇聯的政策，不論是為了它自身的安全，或者是爲了自身的　張，它都是利於「蠶食」政策；換言之，它是利於逐漸的擴張，而未必利於「戰爭」。在這個政策之下，歐陸可能很不安定，共黨可能在各國製造政潮工潮乃至各種各式的恐慌，但是未必立即製造戰爭。第二，蘇聯在對德作戰之後，元氣大傷，據傳說一九四六年還是一個荒年，戰後的五年計劃也沒有完成。很明顯的如果有戰爭的話，一定是一個長期的戰爭，蘇聯有沒有能力來支持另一個長期戰爭，我想蘇聯政府在今天不會有這個自信。第三，作爲蘇聯外圍之東歐各國，在經濟上旣未復蘇，在政治上亦未穩固，似乎還未能作爲戰爭的資本。而在英美這一方面，英國目前的情况，單就經濟來說，它就絕對不會希望同時也不能支持一個國際戰爭。美國方面雖則在物質上佔有優勢，而在地理上距離遼遠，在歐洲方面所有可以作爲美國與國的國家，其力量均甚有限，在這種情形之下，如果說美國會發動戰爭亦不可信。當然的，這是就雙方的利害來估量。戰爭的發生，常常是帶有「偶然」的意味，第一次大戰於　皇儲之被刺，第二次大戰，希特勒東　之流，也決未想到會引起這樣的一個曠日　久的戰事。所以在敵對的雙方都沒有自信的時候，戰事發生的可能性，仍然是很小的。吾人衛情度勢，一九四八年的歐陸可能是劍拔弩張之局，一方面是極力安定西歐，另一方面則為鞏固東歐。可能的有很多不能解決的問題，也可能在若干國家內部發生動盪不寗的局面。（一九四八年一月五日寄自倫敎）</p>

<p>（上文見左角）舞女是否願意嫁人？以何種人爲理想的丈夫？金美虹以為禁舞後當然嫁人最好，但是選擇對象可不客易啊，跑舞塲的現在是中年人多，靑年人少，中年哀樂，玩舞女僅是一種排遺和發洩，能和他們論婚娶嗎？同居，作妾，朝不保暮，暫時的物質享受會帶來斬不斷的千種哀愁！舞女聯誼會十五個幹事中，因爲顧慮舞禁，有五個人匆促嫁了人，都是屆居　室，沒有人敢推想　慘的遭際何時會降臨到她們的身上！</p>
<h3 id="c72">多數不願作妾 <a href="#c72" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e72" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">72</a></h3>
<p>孫致敏說，多數舞女是不願做小星的，做了人家姨太太，給夫家親戚朋友指指觸觸，冷嘲熱　，這種氣就受不了。孫小姐非常坦白的拿她自己來講，她也　過好幾年　，同學很多，其中也有未結婚的，頗願娶她，但一個公務員，担負二個人的生活已不容易，何能再供養她的一家老小。而她老母患有肺病，弱妹要撫養，對方那來餘錢？像這種情形，呌她如何解決婚姻問題？</p>
<p>在座的各位舞女，一致認爲社會上一般人對於舞女是歧視的，如杲不娶作小星，誰願意來娶舞女呢！但她們都不希望住洋房，坐汽車，祇要能吃飽飯，也能使她家　的老小得到一點溫飽則滿足了。</p>
<p>孟燕的理想丈夫是：年紀大些倒無所謂，但要沒有太太，同時能使弟妹也得到一個謀生的機會。</p>
<p>正　認爲如果有了太太的人想納她做小里，祇要家裹的人都承認她，把她和大太太同等看待，那亦無不可嫁，刻苦操作，到亦並不在乎，如果做了小星而飽受虐待譏諷，則寗願自殺了！</p>
<h3 id="c73">可怕的幾個例子 <a href="#c73" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e73" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">73</a></h3>
<p>她們又說：自從藥舞令下後，「丈夫」便無所謂「理想」了，祇要略合要求，就不惜降格相許，但是她們對嫁人始終懐着恐懼。接着舉出了幾個事實例證：</p>
<p>某舞女結識了一個家貧有志的靑年，一見傾心，委身相事，並盡出積蓄，幫助他讀書，再托舞客替他找職業，心力交瘁，將近六七年的漫長時間，她完全生活在期待裏，但是結果期待終於幻烕了，這靑年忘去了培育大德，學成後遺素了她。這靑年和他的家庭表示與一個做　舞女的女人結合終究攸關名譽，但他忘記了　名譽就是卑微的舞女所賦予的。期待幻烕使這舞女一憤幾絕，從此她決心愛金錢不認人，生張藝魏，用　　和人世賭博，用眼淚受　嘲。最近又和一位軍人遊戲式的同居了，她唯一的要求是要繼續伴舞生涯，她說：「我還想把握一些熟客在手裏，因爲怕他玩膩了再丟掉我啊！」</p>
<p>又有某舞女嫁給一個中產階級商人，柴米夫妻可以相安無事了，那知未出十天，即吿脫幅，據男方吿人稱：「玩了一個多星期，够了！」</p>
<p>人海蒼茫，在舞池內外積累起來的閱歷，使她們知道嫁人是一條想走而又無怯走通的路。上海有百分之廿以上從十四歲起就開始伴舞的孩子，現在她們已執業渝　十年，但從不言嫁。席問她們迫述去年禁舞令下時的心情說：「我們眞說不出是慌張？還是渺茫？……」</p>

<p>上海現有大小各舞廳的四千多舞女，因爲政府的禁舞令已經正式到了上海，發生了「今後將怎樣活下去」的一個嚴車問題。她們雖然在全體大會中喊出了「自助助人」的口號，更積極的作起了轉業的準備；但是轉業又豈是輕而易舉的一件事？緊跟着來的問題，怎樣轉？往那裏轉？轉業以後，是否生活可以獲得解決？這都是値得考慮的事。至於開學校，舉辦技術訓練班，在表面上看來雖然不失爲一種解決的途徑，但是　募經費，如何開班，這都需要假以相當時日的，何况舞女的敎育程度參差不齊，課程的選擇等等都有相當困難。即使說這些難關都順利過去了，舞女可以受訓就學了，但受訓期間少說些亦該有一年半　吧！那末這長長的時期中她們的生活如何維持呢？這一連串的困難，都是舞女們日夜所思慮的切　問題，也就是整個的社會問題。至於一般人以爲舞女最好的轉業就是嫁人，然而目前能够負担舞女一家人的生活能有幾個？舞女是不是甘願做小星？這些似乎容易解決而實際上極難解決的問題，都是爲舞女們最感覺惶恐的事。一本報爲了這一個相當嚴重的社會問題，特地邀集了代表大小八家舞塲的十二位舞女，舉行了一次集體訪問，從她們的口中，我們獲得了一個更深刻的認識，就是擺在她們眼前的，是焦急，是徬徨。</p>
<p>在短短的三個小時談話中，這十位來自各舞塲的舞女，給我們的印象決不是一般人所想像的，她們富有正義感，分析事實的有倏有理，和發言時的强而有力，在在表現出她們都有一個優良品行的底子。這裏我們可以看到金美虹表現出富有領導能力的天才；和思慮深刻，談話能抓住人心的孟燕；以及口齒伶俐善於演說的孫致敏</p>
<p>綜合她們的意見：她們認爲轉業旣難，嫁人亦不易，最後還是希望政府能夠寬限一個時期。</p>
<h3 id="c79">轉業問題困難重重　大學生且多失業更使她們起恐慌 <a href="#c79" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e79" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">79</a></h3>
<p>孟燕是昨天出席的舞女中打扮得最樸素的，藍布罩袍，老棉鞋，不施脂粉，發誓時最歉遜，而且小心翼翼，描述首身淒凉身世時，聲浪微顫，敎人憐愛。她表示只要能够活下去，速幫佣都願意。她說：「我是沒有飯吃才做舞女的。我母親老了，不能賺錢，弟弟還小，不能做工，現在靠我賺錢來供給他讀書。要是一且禁舞，我拿什麼去　活這一家？」歸納她對於舞女轉業的意見，她認爲一部份受過敎育，初中程度的舞女，或許還有改行的可能，可是大部份不識字的舞女將怎麼樣呢？孟小姐表示她沒唸過書，她也曾考慮過自己在禁舞以後的出路——做廠吧，耳邊聽到的，僅是裁員和倒閉，想進去也不見得容易，就說謀得了，又是不是足以維持全家的生活？……除了做廠之外，就是幫佣。她說她並不是不願意去幫人，可是困難在於幫人以後，本人的生活雖然解決了，母親和幼弟的生活怎麼過？何況目前市面如此不景氣，百物飛漲，大公館裏面也講節儉了。孟小姐談神後來，情緒已趨激昂，臉色蒼白，到情緊張，她以沉痛的語調說「我希望用自己的雙手來養活自己。假如飯吃不飽，連吃粥都甘願，但是總得給我們一條路走！敵僞時期，尙有一口戶口米吃，現在政府禁令如鐵，呌我們往何處去？」</p>
<p>多數未受良好敎育</p>
<p>金美虹以爲舞女中百分之七十以上未受過良好敎育，轉業訓練自應從實用技術着手，但是訓練經費的籌措，並非咄嗟可辦的！何况訓練完成後不一定就能獲得職業，大學生失業的正多整呢！</p>
<p>她補充說：假使一種職業同時有大學生與舞女應徵，我敢斷定社會的抉擇一定是屬於大學生。她指出社會上對舞女生活估定爲　華荒誔是一個絕大的錯誤。交際花型的舞女，雖然和達官富賈無分　　，但那僅佔極少數，目前月入七百萬元的舞女已是中上階級，一二百萬元的極爲普通，試想每個舞女都有家庭負擔。都有自己的門面開銷，寥寥收入，並不比一個商店職員爲高。假使現在有商店以三四）百萬的月薪繳　職員，她們願意立刻拾跳舞而轉業。</p>
<p>年齡在　以上居多</p>
<p>她們一致承認：舞女中卅歲以上的「徐娘」很多，嫁過人，生過兒女。但是抗戰中犧牲的犧牲，離散的離散，更有的老母垂危，老父殘疾，所以生活的擔子綫殘酷地壓上她們的肩頭。社會上以爲舞女妖形怪狀，冶容誨淫，其實這不過是騙飯吃的一種痛苦的手段。也有人說舞女卑鄙下賤，但上海不是還有比舞女下賤的職業正繼續左在着嗎？爲什麼舞女的命運咬她們還要悲慘？</p>
<p>後排右起：金美虹。李菁。王敏。王瑛。王美英。孟燕。前排右起：錢素珍。洪小萍。孫致敏。陳雪莉</p>
<p>實際困難有三點　最後她門分析舞女轉業的實際困難有三點：第一，百分之十以上的徐娘型舞女，大都均有兒女，遲睡遲起，處理家務，轉業異常困難。第二，一部份自甘墮落，惡習已深的舞女，置業根本不可能。第三，願意置業而缺乏技能及機會的，等於不能置業。在這許多困難下設立學校進行訓練，常然最爲理想，但是學校　費初步預算即需一百億，這還有待於各方面的帮助和指導。最後更希望政府撥給職業訓練學校校舍，並在可能範圍內將抽籤時間再予展延。</p>
<p>孫致敏說：她找了三個月的職業，至今猶無着落，對於轉業一點，表示相當的悲觀。她不願意做一個「有條件的女職員」，或者做一個「沒有會由的花瓶」，何况在目前市面不景氣的情形下，就是運有技能的找事還不容易，那裏再輸得到我們這一大　呢？她個人所希望的，是由政府或社會人土舉辦一個　級公司，或其他手工業工廠，因爲辦其他工廠，經費旣大，且舞女技術亦不够（下文轉右角）</p>

<h3 id="c81">閩北公路綱 <a href="#c81" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e81" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">81</a></h3>
<p>〔本報福州八日航訊〕由浙江到福建，通常有三條路可循：一由抗州經上海乘輪赴榕，一由溫州至平陽　江。乘小輸赴榕，另外一條便是搭浙贛路火車至江山，乘汽車越仙　嶺入閩。記者這次來閩，則採擇了第三條路。</p>
<p>自江山至浦城，自浦城至建陽，又自建陽至南平，這三天時問，三百五十六公里的路程，是够人難挨的，車自江山出發，第一關便是閩浙分界地帶的　由重重，迎面來的是山，兩面地逝而過的也是山，初從江浙平原一帶生活慣的人，初入此間是會渾疑置身異境的。山路旣崎嶇，公路也就不得不折曲盤旋，公路車更得依綫越進，記者在閩浙贛三省公路交又點——楓嶺附近時，就親見車子越過一個大宮廟時就繞過三匝，第一次自殿基經過，第二次折殿門口灣上，第三次方達殿頂等高的一條路上，車路的曲折，由此可以概見。</p>
<p>楓嶺南下</p>
<p>經浦　至建陽，這一帶是閩北主峯武夾山脈絡所經，又是閩江上浙建溪水路所注，山峯摺　之外，復　之以河流迥覆，　在沿溪行，則見羣山如堵，在山頂行，則見溪流如帶，假如不是軍身顛簸得使人難受的話，一　山水風光，倒是够味的。自建陽經建甌至南平，這一段路是全國著名的建本出產地帶，福建木材的原料採集地，兩旁杉本松木如山如海，時値初秋，綠葉依舊，餘蔭遮天，蔚爲奇觀。至南平後，閩北三溪合流，問江水路放寬，到福州的乘客至此便得棄汽車而乘小汽輸了。</p>
<p>據說，在十五年以前，這兒仍還是荒漠小徑，民廿二年，「閩變」發生後，中央爲軍略上需要，才下令趕　運條公路網與浙贛路前身杭江織路銜接，除江西至消城道段外，假如以建陽爲中心的話，還有四幹綫六支綫，這便造成所謂「閩北公路綱」，這</p>
<p>四條幹綫</p>
<p>分佈如下：　由建陽東經水吉北上上消城凡一一八公里，可延伸至江山與浙贛鐵路　接。　自建陽經武夷宮·崇安過閩贛分界嶺－汾水關至江西鉛山終點上　，凡一百九十公里。目前亦可與浙贛路　接。　自建陽經麻沙·邵武入光澤，凡一百十二公里，此路可與　東諸公路綫聯絡。　自建陽至建甌，一經古田入福州凡二百餘公星，一經南平，沿江西上，逗順昌·將樂分展至邵武·建寗各地，全長亦有二百公里左右，實際上，這一公路綱觸　所及，已達三省，北有鐵路，甫有海洋，已眞正可配稱爲「網」了。</p>
<p>然而，這條路是多難的，自開　以後，首先便遭到兵匪交擾，交通時續時輟，戰前實際通車狀况，並不可觀，延至抗戰軍興，福州與外洋交通被封鎖，省會後撤，這條路才加强了它的重耍性，特別到了卅一年後，戰事東南移，浙贛沿綫一切中心移入閩贛時，這條路更益臻繁榮，當時汽軍往返　數之頻仍，爲全國各地冠，造成僅次於後來「雷多公路」的汽車運輸量最高紀錄。抗戰勝利後，隨着一陣亂搬亂動，接着這條路又漸次失却作用了，有一時候據說還至中斷一短時期，也僅僅是到了最近，新贛通軍，金　嚴一帶運輸車轉移陣地到這兒謀生了，這條路方吿重新活躍</p>
<p>目前浙省公路局，交通部公路總管理處，曁福建省公路局均在此綫</p>
<p>輪流服務</p>
<p>每日徑常往返四錢的卡軍客軍數約五六十部，營業狀况雖不甚佳，但也並不淸淡，運出去的　是問北土產，例如浦城的筍，邵武的紙，建甌的香菇，建陽的運子，武夷的茶，以及閩江上的各地的米，雜糧等等，運回來的便是布疋。日常用具，工業製成品等，這是中國農村間特有的貿易形態，當然，這一帶也不能例外。今天，單憑記者的觀測，對這條公路網的未來前途，是十分樂觀的，並且可以說這一樂觀階段，此刻已經開始，因爲憑着閩北豐富的物產，鐵路海洋河流各可互達的交通錢，配着這些年來，閩僑高聲呌喊的「開發閩西北」呼聲，畢竟會令人相信閩北是大有辦法的。（特約記者黃岑）</p>

<p>— 王爵榮</p>
<p>記得在抗戰期間，一天晚上，有一位小姐介紹他的哥哥來看病，檢查之下，發覺這位靑年，患有很重的性病，於是我代他注射了一針，另外開了一些藥片和藥水，吿訴他服法和用法，幷對他稍作道義上的勸吿；在這時他忽然問我：</p>
<p>「醫師，你有辦法使我明天就好嗎！』</p>
<p>那有這麼快？』我這樣答復他：「你至少還要來診好多次，到完全治愈爲止！』</p>
<p>「可是」，他急忙的徇我說：「我明天就要回松江，因爲後天是我結婚的日子！」</p>
<p>「什麼？」我詫異的問他：「你後天就要結婚嗎？在你的性病沒有好以前，你是絕對不能結婚的！你將傳染這可怕的病給你的妻子，也許給你的子女，這不是兒戲的事！」</p>
<p>「那有什麼辦法呢？」他狠爲難的說：「什麼都預備好了，帖子也發了，改期是辦不到的！」</p>
<p>經過一小時的解釋和忠吿，最後他總算答應設法展期結婚；在他走了以後，我雖然損失了一個鐘點的時間，可是內心的滿意，使我非常高興！</p>
<p>第二天，他沒有來，我以爲他一定回去改期了，第三天一直到很久，他沒有再來過，我也漸漸對這事忘懷了。</p>
<p>三四個月以後，這位小姐介紹了一位少婦來診病，並且在介紹片上這樣寫着：「這是我的新嫂嫂，結婚還不滿四個月，她從松江來，請我介紹一位醫師，所以我介招她來看你……」我於是想起了四個月前那位靑年，詢問之後，那知靑年的婚期並未延遲；我開始爲這少婦担心，是否已經不幸的被傳染。</p>
<p>經過各種檢查，華氏反應康氏，反應俱呈陽性，而小便的Zonbeck孕姙早期診斷反應也是陽性！顯然的，她已經傳染了他丈夫的惡疾，而且有了身孕，我又開始爲這無辜的嬰兒担憂！</p>
<p>診室裏的助手，因爲參加工作時，對這事的始末，知道得很詳盡，在少婦走了以後，開始咀咒這靑年的行爲不端，以致使少婦和嬰兒蒙上了不易洗淨的惡疾</p>
<p>當然，我對這位靑年不聽勸吿招此惡果，深表遺憾，可是我並不完全同意我的助手將全部責任加在這靑年的身上，我認爲衛生行政當局，該負相當責任。</p>
<p>爲什麼呢？因為在中國「婚前健康强迫檢查制度「到今天還沒有確立，因此之故，不知多少無辜少婦在新婚不久，就被傳染性病！當然更多的嬰兒因化而流產，幸而誕生的，也因爸爸而這傳了可怕的惡疾！</p>
<p>在歡洲各前進國家，婚前健康強迫檢查制度，早已實行有年，非但因此對優生學方面貢獻極大，且對整個民族健康和性病預防前途，收更大的效果！</p>
<p>被譏爲「東亞病夫」的我國，爲什麼不及早建立這優良的制度呢？</p>
<p>在今年三月作者和黃嘉音吳源泰諸兄應中華基督敎靑年會之邀，在該會大禮堂舉辦「婚姻問題系統演講」時，作者曾一再提及婚前健康檢查之重要，籲請最高衛生行政當局注意！同年九月，作者應申報館之邀。在各電台作星期特別廣播時，兩度公開　請社會人士對此問題加以注意，有一次作者在「快樂家庭社」公開演講時，也曾　請各位快做「丈母娘」的太太們，不要祇　「丈母娘看女婿越看越有趣」，祇知注意女婿外表，不知看重健康檢查。後來應某女中之邀演講，也曾請求各位小姐與其提出「鑽戒或灰背大衣」的要求，不如要求一張更有價値的健康檢查證明書，來得合算。健康是無價之實，孩子是家庭樂趣的象徽！假使你有了鑽戒大衣，而失去了健康和可愛的小天使，你會悔不會後呢？</p>
<p>最近聰說本市衛生局在對這問題注意了，而社會人士對此非但不感興趣，而且少數報章刋載有對此新運動冷嘲熱諷的稿件，我因濡筆寫成此稿，對此運動加以說明，希望能引起社會人士的注意。民族健康的前述，實有賴於此運動之推展！並請衛生當局一面注意廣事宣傳，一面將化計劃，提交衛生部，再由行政院轉咨立法院，完成立法程序，而後全國各地，可以同時强制執行。</p>
<h3 id="c126">肺結核病的防禦（二） <a href="#c126" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e126" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">126</a></h3>
<p>— 余正行</p>
<p>一素質關係：在結核捍菌未發現以前，結核病的傳染性，尙未充分有據，故頗重視個人因素。到今日已完全闡明其純爲傳染病，素因關係已不重要。惟結核病易成家庭病，除傳染免疫外，尙有其他原因。故今日之素因，乃指體質（包括無力性體質與腺病體質）國胎盤傳染，以及其他種誘因合體面言。</p>
<p>二環境關係：罹肺結核病者，由於環境之影響甚大。如過勞，或營養不良，或精神心理不快，而常憂鬱者，均易感染肺結核病。</p>
<p>肺結核罹病率與經濟關係歐洲稱肺結核病爲「貧民病」。貧窮的人，終日勞碌，生活愁苦，並限於經濟能力，致營養不良，因此增高對肺結核感染的因素。據漢堡統計：每年收入九〇〇—一二〇〇馬克者，一萬人中死九〇人。每年收入一〇〇〇〇—〇〇〇〇馬克者，每萬人中死亡七·四人。可知罹病率與經濟之高下成反比例。因感染以後，無力就醫治療，死亡率自隨之增加。</p>
<p>肺結核罹病率與職業關係因職業不同，感染亦有差異。各種職業中，以能產生灰塵之職業（如石工百分之九十，治金工百分之七三·七及礦工等）及與患者接能機會頻繁之職業工作者（如旅館侍者，理髮師，浴室工人）最易感患肺結核病。其次爲室內伏案工作者（如書記，打字員，電務員，縫工，鞋匠等）。因運動少，且無充分之日光照射，以致身體抗力不强者，亦容易罹病。至於體力勞動者（如勞工，負販者，農夫等）在重力運動不持久，又不甚急速情形之下，且有充分的陽光照射，如營養良好，其罹病率較少。</p>

<p>— 橋下客</p>
<p>科學的醫藥知識，科學的衛生知識，不是把一些新名詞——或該說半老名詞或已老名詞——如維他命，荷爾蒙等等，說得到口純熟就算數的。要是以「能說」就算數，那末，那些作八股文章的冬烘先生，何嘗不自命是替聖人說話，「立言」，然而終究是八股。會說維他命茶爾蒙的，要是「止於會說」而已，那就很可能一變而為難他命八股與荷爾蒙八股，也就是所謂洋八股。誰願意腐化到八股地位呢？怎樣才可以避免腐化呢？我們不得不在信仰上建設一個能够防腐的基礎，這個基礎可稱之爲信仰自由的範圍。</p>
<p>我不談維他命，不談荷爾蒙，而談談——直到規在還有那麼許多人那麼高興談，那麼許多人那麼高興聽的——鬼與殭屍。當然，此地的賓貴篇幅不是聊齋，決不能用聊齋的腔調來談。而且也不是胡適文存或獨秀文存，不必把他們說過的話，關於鬼之有無的話，再來加以引用；雖然他們的話，關於鬼之有無的話，到現在很値得一看的。</p>
<p>你以爲有鬼嗎？不管你怎樣回答，或肯定，或否定，或肯而不定，或否而不定，或定不置肯否，好好，總是你的自由，信仰自由。這個自由是可以允許的，不妨稱牠爲範圍以內的自由。爲什麼可以允許呢？因爲信鬼的不能證明其有，不信鬼的不能證明其無，那就只好各聽尊便，無從勉强。至於小說中的鬼記載，父老們的鬼傳說，無論如何活靈活現，如果不能當塲約期表演，在科學立塲上是站不住的。鬼照片，鬼把戲，中外名人的「科學化鬼演出」，終究還是笑話）或客氣一點說，還是疑問。</p>
<p>你以為有殭屍？列位？這裏不允許有信仰的自由，回答只有一個：殭屍不會有！當然，殭屍的定養得聲明一下，：人死之後，裝進棺材，經過若干年月，屍體會跳出來，（衆口一辭的說殭屍只會跳不會走），逐人抓人傷人吃人。——列位見過一個死蚊子或死蒼蠅變成　屍蚊子，或殭屍蒼蠅跳跳蹦　的出現嗎？要是昆蟲專家能够製造蚊蠅殭屍，這就等於起死回生。列位，這裹的死是說眞死，因爲假死的回生是不足爲奇的。列位，我設變成殭屍是回生，完全沒錯。因爲殭屍會跳，跳是運動生理，起碼證明肌肉細胞是活了。然而把一個已死的眞死的細胞變活，目前還不能——要是能，多麼高興呀！起死回生，起已死眞死久死而回生，目前是不可能的事，雖經努力硏究而仍無成績的事。因此，不能相信有殭屍，不能相信辰州符能趕屍體回鄉那些事。如果你偏要相信，雖然這是你的自由，但是應稱爲範圍以外的自由，在科學立塲上是不允許的。爲什麼不允許呢？因爲相信的不能證明其有，不信的已經證明其無。</p>
<p>在同樣的迷信名稱之下，郤有信鬼的自由而沒有信殭屍的自由。在同樣的科學名稱之下，你能隨隨便便的信或不信嗎？你能有不守範圍的信仰自由嗎？</p>
<h3 id="c128">缺乏維他命B2之症象 <a href="#c128" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e128" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">128</a></h3>
<p>— 梁俊靑</p>
<p>我們做內科或兒科醫師的人們常常會遇着病孩的父母領着他們的兒女前來求診臉黃肌瘦，口角潰爛發育不全的病症。這當然是一種症象，並不是一種病症，因爲有許多病症都有類此的症象，我們不能隨便說他患的就是某一種病症。可是，經驗吿訴我們，假使我們當作牠是慢性結核症，那是錯了。假使說牠是惡性貧血症呢，這也是錯了。假使我們說牠不過是一種普通的慢性口腔炎，附帶有慢性貧血症，或則患有腹內的寄生蟲症（如蛔蟲之類），只要把局部的口腔炎醫好，或則把慢性貧血醫好，把賜內的寄生蟲治好，這些症象就會退消了的。這當然也是錯了。因爲按照這種醫法，這種症象是永遠也不會退消的。爲什麼呢？因爲這是患的維他命B2缺乏症，假使沒有給予充分的維他命B2，那末他們這種症象是永遠不會退消的。有許多的病孩的父母正在對着鈔票嘆氣，想想有了鈔票也沒有用，買了許多補藥給小孩吃，總不見效，反而看見小孩一天到晚總是臉黃肌瘦。「這眞是氣惱人啊！」其實藥物假使不對症，那末隨便你有多少錢也沒有用，隨便給他吃多少補藥也是白費心思的。我現在所說的維他命B2缺乏症就是其中的一種，只要我們能够認識這種病症，而隨時給予治療和預防，那末小孩兒就不會生這種病症。由此類推，對於其他的病症，還不是隨時需要我們的認識和防範麼？</p>
<p>說到維他命B2，牠的東西是比較的新穎些。在抗戰以前雖則已經有人發表過論文，說從維他命B內可以分離出另外一種黃色的物質，說牠是促使幼孩生長不可缺少的東西，可是曉得的人還不很多。自從第二次世界大戰發生之後，一般的醫藥學專家都在埋頭苦幹地研究，他們對於人類有福利的工作。除了其他無數的醫藥發明之外，在維他命方面的研究上更有許多偉大的發明。別的且不必談，就拿維他命B2來說，也已經有更成功的硏究了，因為篇幅的關係，和求其通俗起見，我們只能在下面約略地介紹如下：</p>
<p>維他命B2（即Laktofavin）是水溶性的東西。牠是促成幼孩生長的必要基質。假使缺乏了他，那末小孩的發育便會受阻。牠是黃色的發閃光的東西。在牛乳內可以提鍊出來。在桔子，鷄蛋，及酵母內也有牠。假使幼孩在營養方面缺乏了牠而不甚厲害時，那末牠就可以使人患腸胃炎，貧血症，口腔炎，舌頭炎，口角炎，以及種種皮膚病。</p>
<p>據荷蘭醫師Van　Creveld氏報吿「當着日寇侵襲荷屬東印度的時候，有許多荷籍婦女及兒童被日寇拘捕圈禁在集中營內，共有三四年。起初的糧食尙可勉强應付，其後則逐漸減少。若以熟力量來計算，則自二千熱力量左右（Ca　2000kalorien）减至一千熱力量左右。而最覺令人難受的就是肉食的减少。後來到了戰爭末期中那末只能以豆類或其他穀食充飢。倘欲尋求肉食那麼只有捕食蛙蛇之類了。嗣後日寇敗降，這批無辜受累的的擠擁，又因途次發生劇烈之麻疹，結果這批難童及幼孩均屬臉無人色，貧血異常，不特營養精形非常惡劣，抑亦口唇生瘡，舌頭發炎，全身患有顆粒性皮膚病，（見岡三）。雖用其他藥物將其一般營養情形改良，但只有服用大量之維他命B2方始回復健康云。」</p>
<p>根據上述的情形，我們就可以知道缺乏維他命B2的嚴重。而一般事吃一二種食物的小孩呢，那末更容易患這種病症了。</p>

<p>— 惕齋</p>
<p>大家閒談，忽然說到許多事物的起源，如我們「秉筆之士」所常用的文房四寶之類，偶而也說到印刷術。漢居延筆在寗夏發現，其狀殆如今日之鋼笨，乃是四塊長木縛成筆桿，筆頭夾在中間，大致是兎毫鹿毫之類，一用破，就棄去重裝，於是我們了解了右軍的令孫退筆成塚的故事。紙呢，自是更後才有，太監蔡倫用破布魚網造的，可是那時究竟罕用，漢代的西睡木簡那麼多，窄窄的，長長的，足見紙還不大通行。因之又想到漢隸字體何以趨於扁，而且末尾有了那麼一挑，所謂「蠶頭雁尾」也者，殆因竹簡地位有限，不能不用肩體以求多容字數，而尾挑之成，又與筆墨大有關係，筆碩而墨黏，則不得不如是矣。理由很簡單，不必說些雲山霧沼的話，把後人騙得摸不淸頭腦。</p>
<p>可是中國就沒有人寫這種旣通俗而又不低級的書。講書法就是「筆陣圖」，什麼「永字八法」之類，弄得你莫明其妙，推而至於其他，無一不是如此。瑞典的高本漢（Kalgren一譯珂爾倔倫）的中文分析字典，一下子就用國際當標注出中國字的古音，乾乾脆脆，不像中國的專講「口耳之學」的學者，自陳第顧炎武孔廣森段玉裁直至章黃諸君，只是在那裏玩陰陽對轉淸聲濁聲的把戲，致使許多大學畢了業的人還要目之爲「天書」，歸根結蒂，也還是得依高氏的法子，注出聲來，給後人一個具體概念。如果還有人在課堂上講什麼「一等洪大，二等次之，三四皆細，而四尤細，」的四等聲音分別，那簡直是糊塗。不過，可恥的是，這淸晰而具體的方法，非外國人給我們領了路子不可，而文字却是我們三千年來的寳貝！思之豈不寒心！</p>
<p>我們時常感覺到中國的所謂學者是專門把學術關在大門以內的，絕對不要他「下於庶人」，即便他費了一番心，弄明白一件小間題，也必得神而明之，櫝而藏之，把他說得多神奇莫測，令人不知其底蘊，這樣，隔個一年半年，發表一篇學院式旣高深且糊塗的論文，多製造迷魂洞，多製造知識上的迷津（Puzzles），學者的地位就高了，我們對於他也就更加莫測，莫測殆即「高深」之代名詞，因爲你不明白他的以「艱深文淺陋」的寳藏，你才非去請敎他不可，—假如你決要打破砂鍋問到底的話—那麼，學者之架子即於此時擺起來矣！</p>
<p>我們的硏究機關不能說不多，花的錢也動以若干億計，而其所表現者何在？小百姓們不知道這些東西跟他們有何關係，儘管那些億也是直接間接抽了他們的血。然而我們的學者却絕對不引此爲內愧，文必高，冊必典，距離現世界越遠，越得涅槃。</p>
<p>看着外國許多科學專家寫了那麼些通俗科學的小冊子，眞是羨慕，學歷史可以給你寫出有趣而正確的故事，學物理的就可以給你寫出人人易知的原子彈大道理，他們願意把自己消化了的東西，變成維他命ABCD，再來哺喂世上的　者，而不是吃了大魚大肉，專門去佈迷魂陣。</p>
<p>俄國的伊林Ilin所寫的「十萬個爲什麼」，「黑白」，「火故事」，「室內旅行」等，那一國沒有譯本？美國的PopularScience更是銷路奇隹，我們雖不能至，但應該心向往之，這好比作糖，必須的條件是有甜味，沒有甜味的糖，便是土苴。西洋藥都有糖衣，以减輕我們對於苦的負担，除去糖本身是重要滋養品之外，此種作用，殆亦不可輕視。我們中國的專家學者，也許會是作糖的，可是他們忘了一件東西——甜味！</p>
<p>誰肯吃這種味如嚼蠟的東西呢？</p>

<p>這種臘乳劑可使質料的外表，顯得商貴，有經久耐用之感。帷幔或衣裙經過臘乳劑的整理之後，能够保住原來的式樣，並使帷幔之類懸掛的東西生命久長。每次法濯之後，必須重上一次臘乳劑，以重新發生防水力量。</p>

<p>— 靜紋</p>
<p>這幾天翻開報紙，除了滿幅令人一見心　的　漲　漲外，使人感覺到人間還有一絲溫暖的是極為踴躍的冬賑捐款。眾擎易舉，集腋成裘，由千而萬而億而十億百億，可見得肯體恤在死亡綫上掙扎的難胞的人，還是很多。</p>
<p>但是救濟原是最艱鉅的工作，募集鉅款固然麻煩，怎橡把錢用得最恰當，使每一元法幣都不浪費，更不容易。我們不但要把賑款交給眞正的難民，並且還得力求迅速，爭取時間。冬賑者，搶救嚴寒中的難民，以免於死亡也。如果募集迂緩，發放遲延，「急驚風碰着慢郞中」，則「遠水不救近火」，坐視銀行中捐款纍纍文風不動，而無情寒流，却是毫不等待的！等到大地回春，天氣轉暖，西江大水，難救涸轍之鉗，這時節鉅款固已集齊，但是人死不能復生，又伺補於事？</p>
<p>「痛苦」原是最抽象的名詞，無論怎樣用文字來解釋，用言語來形容，始終不能傳眞，就說飢寒兩個字吧，天天酒宴盛會，貂冠重裘的人們自不必說，即是三餐粗飽，有件破棉被舊大衣的，也很難體會飢寒的痛苦。非要親自經歷過二天沒東西下肚，一件夾襖在風雪顫顫抖的滋味，才能知道餓和冷決不是少吃一碗早飯，少穿一衣背心所能比擬干萬一，北風一緊，一個晚上就可以死上幾百個人呢！</p>
<p>「死」，如果「死得其所」，那倒精神上可以自吿無愧，一般信敎的所謂升入天堂極樂世界，即是這個意思。不幸而如果可以活下去而活不下去，當然是「死不瞑目」了。</p>
<p>我們必須打破牛步化的習氣，而拿他人的痛苦作爲自己的痛苦。救濟如救火，最忌拖延！否則，我雖不殺伯仁，伯仁由我而死，這些從鬼門口上給拉回來的難胞，依然逃不了凍餒的魔掌，難民們固然死不瞑目，我們又蚩能心安？</p>
<p>按今日之中正東路，在日本發動太平洋戰爭前，爲愛多亞路，再二十年前，爲一河浜，滬人稱爲洋涇浜，河北爲英租界，河南爲法租界，河之兩岸旅館林立，如長發棧，泰安棧，佛照樓，各利棧等旅館，皆在二洋涇橋，三洋涇橋一帶。從蘇杭等地坐船來上海之客人，亦在橋邊下船登岸，此事恐三十歲以內的靑年，便不能知之。</p>

<p>— 陳詒先</p>
<p>近在周今覺兄處，看到王蓬心臨北苑瀟湘圖長卷，內有翁同龢題七古一首，係由常熟省墓返京，路過上海，在三洋涇橋旅館候船時作，其詩集內不載，彌可珍責。</p>
<p>題詩時爲己丑重陽節，正同龢得君最專之時，觀詩內有「我今赴闕意飛騰」之句，及小注「龢入謝，面諭浮海當愼重」之語，可以知之。越十年，己亥，再在詩後加一跋，則爲同龢戊戍革職家居後一年，「回懷舊事，恍如夢寐」，其老懷之感傷又可知。（同龢臨終，有五絕一首，「六十年間事，凄涼到蓋棺，不將兩行淚，輕爲汝曹彈」，亡友袁伯藝曾擊節　賞之。）今將其題王卷七古一首及跋語錄後：</p>
<p>「洋涇頭作重九，自煮白魚沽市酒，小樓一角倚明窗，彭　桐　森左右（麓台兩畫）。叩門者誰銅井客，獨以　愁憐下走，蓬心一卷送將　，瀟湘爲舟落吾手。北風釀寒金菊瘦，苦雨連床木棉朽，微波落落渺難即，鈞天廣樂知何有。徑思一訪洞庭君，豈意重逢永州守，永州辭，官居鄂渚，黃鶴樓前看星斗，古懷浩蕩祇自怡，老筆矜嚴頗不苟。董原斯圖本奇作，千仿百　雜妍醜，能從平淡化雄深，前有米傾後董叟。永州臨古不泥古，落筆渾忘誰與某，靈巖館敞　籤筒，快雨堂深驚戶牖。當時諸老共嗟賞，何况留傳百年後。我今赴關意飛騰，尙戀衡雲屢回首，千言炳炳主恩重（覦入謝，面諭浮海當愼重），一雨遲遲天意厚。美君翩然隨玉節，直溯沅湖上岣嶼，江山文字感前因，意筑平生徇良友。夜來題詩愧荒率，滿紙蛟蛇互蟠　，燈花作燄屐聲稀，明日新晴有　否？」跋云：「己丑九月，候風滬上，索居無憀，時　民先生將有　湘之遊，持卷索題，率賦一詩請敎」。又跋云：「己丑九秋與　民方伯遇於滬濱，時　民以邵中丞薦辟偕赴湘中，而余欲省嫂湘中，假程已迫，輒復中止，故詩意及之，今十年矣，　民旣吿歸，余亦伏處家園，一日忽扁舟過訪，出此卷重觀，回懷舊事，恍如夢寐。己亥四月晦，松禪居士同龢記。」</p>

<p>— 克明</p>
<p>偶然翻開報章來看，「小野心家鎯鐺人獄」的標題，首先躍入我的眼簾。內容是：「十六歲少年金實山，會在格致中學讀書，忽於去年自稱行動總隊大隊長，私刻關防，私發派令……」等等。</p>
<p>金寳山雖然祇是一個十六歲的少年，但他的行爲觸犯法紀，當然應該受法律制裁。鎯鐺入獄，正好給他自省，使他覺悟。但是，他所以犯罪的原因，有分析與研究的必要。他自己說：「因爲素有領袖慾，再加平日受電影和連環岡畫的影響」，所以就做出了這些事情。從這寥寥數語中，我們可以充分地看出社會敎育的病態。爲後一代的國民著想，這是不容忽視的。</p>
<p>目前兒童們最歡迎的，除了遊戲之外，就要算連環圖畫了。十多歲的兒童，理解力薄弱，幻想力正當旺盛的時期，傳奇式的故事，希奇古怪的東西，最合他們的要求。而連環圖畫中正多着騰雲駕霧法術無邊的神仙，飛　走壁來去無踪的英雄，身長丈二眼若銅鈴的妖魔，撒豆成兵呼風喚雨的鬼怪！因此，孩子們把牠們當作了課餘消遺的唯一寳具。儘管學校裏嚴厲禁止，他們偷偷摸摸地祇有更加愛看。連環圖畫小書目前銷售之廣，種類之多，絕非任何別的書籍所可比擬。它們的足迹徧佈於每個角落，無論怎樣冷僻的街巷，只要有舊書攤的塲合，馬上可以看到紅紅綠緣的連環圖畫，陳列得滿目琳瑯，美不勝收，吸引着大羣的少年顧客。孩子們看到了便樂得廢寢忘餐，手不釋卷，而不識字的父母竟還有誇獎子女用功的呢！</p>
<p>結果，兒童們脆弱的心靈裏，滲入了毒素，逐漸被麻醉了，久而久之，便演出了到四川峨嵋山去訪師和金寳山一類的「新聞」。在校裏，常可者到小學生們手舞足蹈地大談神怪故事，有時高興起來便裝模作樣的喊着「哇啦啦啦！」或者組織軍隊，自稱大將軍。究其原因，都不外乎想模倣連環圖畫中的怪傑而已，</p>
<p>連環國畫的影響如此，我們不能再眼睜睜的袖手旁觀了罷？</p>

<p>— 許桐華</p>
<p>祖任杜魯門總統的顧問醫師，其身份與地位不亞於專制時代的「御醫」或「甚麼寺大夫」。如果在名刺上加印「杜魯門總統醫藥顧問」這一項頭銜，多少能使收到名刺的對方肅然起敬。</p>
<p>且說現任杜魯門總統的顧間醫師，係華萊斯。格蘭罕陸軍准將，其官階次於少將，而在上校以上。他的責任在照料杜魯門總統及其家族的健康。平常的時候，這是一份比較空閑的差使，儘有業餘從事研究工作的餘暇。但是在杜魯門總統的老太太去世前，他一會須留在華盛頓，一會須趕到格蘭特維去，兩地相去千哩之遙，却使他忙不過來。</p>
<p>自從杜魯門總統的老太太去世後，格蘭罕醫生須留意的只有兩個病人，便是大總統和他的女兒瑪格萊小姐。他們兩人十分康健。他僅須照料他們飲食適中，睡眠充足，運動有恒就行了。</p>
<p>逢到大總統出國遠行時，格蘭罕醫生得檢查總統喝的水，蔬菜，及種種食物，不讓細菌混八烹調的美食內。他發現杜魯門總統是一位聽話的病人，他懂得養生之道，他每天進餐後，必小憩片刻。他一離開公事房，就能將一切大小事務，丟在腦後。他晚上能酣睡八小時，胃口亦好，雖然他吃得不多。他沒有什麼小毛病。</p>
<p>按格蘭罕醫生，身高六呎，生着　色的頭髮，頭頂徽禿，眼珠作藍色，今年卅五歲。他在學生時代是一位遝動健將，也是一位　　家。他生於甘薩斯州哈　市，先後就學於密蘇里大學，密蘇里州中區師範學院，古協登大學醫學院及哈佛大學醫學院。</p>
<p>格蘭罕醫師　開學校後，復在甘　斯州市立醫院，柯克郊外醫院和維也納，布逢佩斯及愛丁堡等地大學內，實習內外科。他在二次大戰中參加醫療工作，歷在英國戰地服務，於某次戰役中，在前綫受傷。他的父親老格蘭罕醫生，却是哈利。社魯門的老友呢。</p>

<p>— 凌霄漢閣</p>
<p>緬甸獨立慶賀聲中，恰巧有位「緬甸小姐」馬聖丁（女靑年會幹事）在北平發表談話，極爽快，極周繫，可供我國人參考處甚多，以美人喀本德Carpenter所寫亞洲游記「緬甸」一段互證尤妙。（喀氏之作出版於一八一九七，雖隔多年，仍有參考價値</p>
<p>她說「緬甸婦女在社會上地位極高，全國受敎育的男人占百分之八十，女人占百分之四十，女人多做校長，醫生，警察，甚至泥瓦匠亦有女人，男女地位是很平等的。」</p>
<p>這是實在情形，却不自今始，喀氏書上亦認爲緬甸風俗之特點，他說：「緬甸女權在全亞洲爲最優」。又說：日本婦人是夫之奴隸，中國婦人是婆婆的奴僕，高麗閨女非乘車轎不能上街，暹羅女子之勞役，比兄弟們繁重，而且是國王的一種財產，馬來婦女，印度婦女，土耳其婦女在市街上很少露面。但緬甸婦女與男子一樣，隨意游行，並不避嫌。婦人與夫有同等的產業權，女性與男性在社交上有同等的立塲，商店有的是女老板，櫃上有的是女招待，婚姻雖非自主而戀愛之喜尙自由則與新大陸同。法律上雖不禁男子納妾，家庭裏却多是一夫一妻，更見愛情之眞擊。</p>
<p>以上各點，若以現代的全亞的情形相衡，自然不足爲奇，但在彼時，尙未經過歐風美雨的洗禮，亞洲各處，莫非封建式的家庭。惟緬甸一隅，無須新潮流之鼓蕩，自有女權，便不能不認爲奇蹟特徵。</p>
<p>關於婚姻一節，據「緬甸小姐」說：「倒不甚自由，男子看上一個女子，須先吿父母，再由父母求女家。若女方自動則爲恥辱。」這一點却有些像中國的奮制。只看舊家之「龍鳳喜帖」，男的家長先送一份，上寫「敬求金諾」，女的家長答覆一帖「敬遵台命」，是訂婚之必要詞句。喀氏游記亦說緬甸父母主持婚事，不必徵求見女的同意，因之私奔不少。男女相悅，自爲配偶，自立家庭，亦所常有。故馬聖丁小姐雖云緬甸婚姻不自由，但又說自已是「戀愛過了」，則可知半「封建」半「民主」，由來久矣。</p>
<p>結婚之日，吃「同盂的飯」，以爲「由此即爲夫婦」之證，則與中國之「　　」（即交杯酒）相同。這些「遺風餘韻」，在近代文明薰掏中，想已逐漸淘汰或變化了。</p>

<p>胡式釭寳存中有云：「吾鄉嘗有一人，入市沽酒，每病其淡，調店中人曰：「爾家酒權斤兩有餘，然何淡？攙水乎？』店中人曰：「無之」旁一鄉人曰：「爾家酒中不攙水，亦水中攙酒耳。「衆人大笑。」此種語句，粗視之似頗相類，然細加思案，即有天淵之別。齊己早梅詩云：「前邨深雪裏，昨夜幾枝開。」鄭谷日：「改「幾』字爲「一」字，方是早梅。」徐乃下拜。可見行文用字之難。韓文公祭十二郞文中，有「敎吾子與汝子幸其成，長吾女與汝女待其嫁。」二句，按「長」字作「養」字解，此「長」字正與上句「敎」字相對，而句末之「幸其成」與「待其嫁」亦相針對，而今人往往誤讀「敎吾子與汝子幸其成長，吾女與汝女待其嫁，」在解釋方面雖亦勉強可通，但下句之句法全無矣。可見不獨行文用字之雜，即讀書亦非易事也。</p>

<p>— 陳慎言</p>
<p>第六章　禍不單行（四三）</p>
<p>渚　見這一句話已打中她的心苗，便又嘆了一口氣道：「我到現在無所埋怨，祗埋怨我命運不好，我要剷除這惡運，拚了我這條命奮鬥，將來或有幸福來臨。我從前是畏淸議，是怕大家議論是非，現在我無所畏怯了！與其苦痛埋在心頭，不如任我意志幹一幹。人生不過數十寒暑，不必自苦，我現在意志已完全改變，我祗能爲我個人前途打算，別的全不管，笑駡由他們笑駡，我毫不在乎，我這幾個月來，所受說不出的苦痛，達到了極！我不能再忍受了。「渚　說到這裏，心中似有感觸，眼眶一紅，流下眼淚來。雲卿面冷心熱，心腸最軟，知道渚齋所以傷心的緣故，也不由一掬同情之淚，心裏一陣酸楚，念拿手絹向眼角印一印，說道：「你別傷心，我認爲一切事情，祗要有志，沒有不成功的。你對你太太不滿，也在情理之中，你太太並不壞，祗是嫁給你，嫁錯了。她若嫁一個商人，或是能克動克儉的人，或是算及毫厘的刻薄人，一定是一個極好內助，能幫助丈夫成家立業。嫁給你，是絕對不合的。」渚齋道：「她那人我就沒法形容。無論她如何服侍我，我總覺得她可厭，沒有一句話和她說得來。在如此情狀之下，不但我痛苦，就是她又何嘗不苦痛！所恨她腦筋太舊，沒有這種離婚觀念，我恨不得請一個明白人和她解說此中的利害，她就能知道離婚倒是於她有利的。」雲卿聽了，默然不語。渚齋道：「我不是沒勇氣，不敢公然提出離婚，祗爲我父親的脾氣，你是知道的，弄得不好，把老人家氣壞，那我是罪通於天了，我一向容忍不敢發作，就爲這一點。但老是這樣容忍下去，我一生幸福，也就完了！」設着又不住嘆氣。雲卿道：「你太太和我還說得來，我若去勸吿，也許能打動她。祗是這事關係太大了，一破壞人家婚姻，一怕人說我閑話，於我是很不利的。」渚齋見雲卿自動表示這意思出來，忙轉出笑容道：「你肯進言，便是救她，也就是救了我，你是很愛我的，難道這一點都不能爲我犧牲？」雲卿臉上一紅道：「我所顧慮，就爲怕人說我閑話，我們過去的事，誰都知道。」</p>

<h3 id="e1">British Envoy and Foreign Minister Wang Confer Earnestly, Kowloon City Case Expected to Be Resolved; Supervisory Committee Suggests Government Retake Hong Kong and Kowloon <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 15th] Regarding the Kowloon City issue, British Ambassador Stevenson and Foreign Minister Wang conferred earnestly again on the evening of the 15th. It is heard that both sides' opinions are nearing agreement, and under the condition of maintaining China's position, this matter is expected to find a reasonable solution.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 15th] There were no major developments in the Kowloon City incident on the 15th. The British Embassy has still not received any instructions from London. Yin Baoyu, Director of the European Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, received Lei Boji, Counselor of the British Embassy, at 11 am to discuss various issues related to the Kowloon City incident again. Yin made a serious request to Lei regarding the Hong Kong court overstepping its authority in sentencing Zhu Peitang and Liu Yifu, representatives of the arrested residents of Kowloon City, to hard labor, earnestly requesting the British to release the two residents and urging the British side to quickly accept the various demands previously made by Foreign Minister Wang to Ambassador Stevenson in order to maintain friendly Sino-British relations. Regarding the issue of jurisdiction over Kowloon City, Lei still maintained his original intention, but for the sake of Sino-British friendship, he agreed to forward our demands to the British Ambassador for immediate communication to the London government.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 15th] The Supervisory Yuan held a discussion meeting of supervisory committee members at 10 am on the 15th to discuss the Kowloon City incident. After the meeting, supervisory committee members He Hanwen, Yu Fen, Huang Fengchi, Yu Shude, Mei Gongren, and 23 others jointly proposed a motion for "Retaking Hong Kong and Kowloon by a Set Date." The original text is as follows: "In the late Qing Dynasty, politics were corrupt, and the great powers took advantage of the danger, successively invading and occupying our country's territory and sovereignty. After the Opium War, Britain forced us to cede Hong Kong. On June 9, 1898, it further forced us to lease Kowloon in order to extend the ruling scope of Hong Kong and its aggressive forces towards South China. After the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, with our country's eight years of heroic struggle, the international status increased, and countries showed deep sympathy to China. They all successively and automatically abolished various unequal treaties signed with China over the past century, and all concessions and leased territories were successively taken back. However, Britain, limited by the interests of its colonies, has not agreed to return Hong Kong, which was seized by aggressive means, and Kowloon, which was forcibly leased, despite repeated reasonable negotiations by our country. Recently, it has become even more intensified. The Hong Kong government authorities have even ordered the Chinese residents of the old city of Kowloon to demolish their houses. On the 5th of this month, the Hong Kong and Kowloon police armed themselves and entered Kowloon City outside the leased territory to forcibly demolish houses and arrest resident representatives, arbitrarily sentencing them to hard labor. On the morning of the 12th, they brazenly shot at Chinese residents, causing public outrage. Our country's government diplomatic authorities have also lodged a serious protest with the British government. The 1898 Sino-British lease treaty regarding the Kowloon Peninsula stipulates that the leased territory is for a period of ninety-nine years, under British jurisdiction, but the Kowloon City area is still the complete territory of China and is not included in the lease. Chinese officials can still perform their duties in the city, residents can still continue to reside and do business, and Chinese warships can still use the waters of Dapeng and Shenzhen. This time, Britain's brutality in Kowloon not only violates the lease treaty but is also a new action of aggression against Chinese sovereignty. Moreover, due to the existence of Hong Kong and the Kowloon leased territory, various illegal elements and groups resisting the government rely on it, and all smuggling uses Hong Kong and Kowloon as a base of operations, and the Hong Kong government also secretly protects them. Considering the facts, since the British government seized Hong Kong and Kowloon by aggressive means in the first place, and now treats our residents with violence, our country's government should re-determine its countermeasures. Since all unequal treaties suffered by our country after the war have been abolished one after another, the remaining poison of the seizure of Hong Kong and the forced lease of Kowloon cannot be allowed to continue to exist. The committee members respectfully suggest in accordance with the law that the government should immediately take effective measures to retake Hong Kong, abolish the Sino-British Kowloon Peninsula lease treaty, retake the Kowloon Peninsula, and demand that the British government compensate our residents for all losses suffered due to this illegal action. If Britain continues to have the same situation as before, our government should protect the residents with force on the one hand and conduct tough negotiations on the other." (Other news about the Kowloon incident is published in another column.)</p>
<p>[United Press, Nanjing, 15th] Xu Chuanlin, leader of the Democratic Socialist Party, commented on the Hong Kong government's action of ordering Chinese residents to withdraw from Kowloon City on the 15th, calling it a disgrace to the British. He suggested that the government sever traffic with Hong Kong for three months as a protest. A spokesman for the Youth Party pointed out that Hong Kong is a remnant of imperialism and demanded that the government retake sovereignty over the island.</p>

The distribution is as follows: 622 for provinces and municipalities (554 male, 68 female), 22 for Mongolia (20 male, 2 female), 15 for Tibet (14 male, 1 female), 6 for various ethnic groups in border areas (5 male, 1 female), 19 for overseas Chinese (all male), and 89 for occupational groups (79 male, 10 female).</p>
<h3 id="e3">Signing of Elected National Assembly Delegates; Central Authorities Consider Remedial Measures Based on the Principle of Mutual Concessions within the Party <a href="#e3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 15th] At yesterday's meeting of the Central Political Committee, over ten representatives from the Association of Nominated and Elected National Assembly Delegates, including Ma Wenche and Li Hongru, went to the Central Party Headquarters to petition.

<p>[Another Telegram] The authorities have recently been studying the dispute between nominated and elected delegates and party-nominated delegates through a property rights subcommittee. They also attach great importance to the opinions of various petitioning groups and have held meetings to discuss them. It is heard that the Central Government, under the principle of adhering to the method of conceding to friendly parties and mutual concessions among comrades within the party, will give consideration to certain elected candidates who are truly factual.</p>

<p>[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 14th] It is reported that Japan can obtain 50,000 tons of soybeans from Northeast China at the beginning of this year. Our delegation and the Japanese government have officially signed a contract for the export of 20,000 tons of soybeans to Japan. The contract for the remaining 30,000 tons will be signed soon.

The price of the soybeans purchased by Japan is 1.72 million yuan per ton, and the payment is directly handed over to the Chinese government, not in the form of barter. This transaction is the first time that Northeast soybeans have been imported since Japan's surrender. In the past, Japan purchased approximately 800,000 tons of Northeast soybeans annually.</p>

<p>[Central News Agency, Manila, 15th, United Press] It is reported that Chen Zhiping, the Chinese envoy stationed in the Philippines, recently telegraphed from Nanjing to Philippine President Roxas requesting a postponement of the implementation of the law granting Filipinos priority over foreigners in obtaining public market stalls. It is reported that Roxas's reply was that this request could not be granted, the reason being that the Filipinization market movement, which began before the war, was implemented last year, and the Philippine government had previously granted a postponement of the licenses of Chinese vendors at the request of the Chinese government. It is reported that the drawing of lots by Filipinos to determine who gets the stalls vacated by overseas Chinese has been held, and those who won have moved into the vacated stalls.</p>

The discussions and contacts regarding the Xinjiang issue and their development were described in the letters. When a reporter asked when Zhang would return to Dihua, Zhang said that he would be leaving Beijing to fly to Lanzhou in the short term to rest. He said that he had not yet received a reply to his letter from A. The letter was taken out of Beijing on December 10 and delivered to A on the 27th in Dihua. He is currently awaiting A's reply. However, Zhang said with a very confident tone: "We believe that A has no reason to reject the central government's opinion and not accept the invitation to come to Beijing for negotiations." That is, he trusts that A can come to Beijing. Zhang will still wait quietly for A's reply after arriving in Lanzhou. If A agrees to start negotiations in Dihua, Zhang will fly to Dihua from Lanzhou. If A agrees to come to Beijing, he will travel to Beijing with him when he passes through Lanzhou. Regarding the election of the provincial governor of Xinjiang, Zhang said: "Because the Xinjiang region is vast, notification takes time, and transportation is inconvenient, but it can be started before the opening of the National Assembly." Furthermore, regarding the rumor that Zhang will preside over military command affairs in the Northwest, Zhang specifically denied it, saying that his trip is purely for recuperation.</p>

Furthermore, in order to command more flexibly, the Pacification Headquarters has established a command post in Daxian, and the ninth, tenth, and fifteenth administrative districts are all under its jurisdiction.</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3 id="e24">The Military Focus is in the North <a href="#e24" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c24" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">24</a></h3>
<p>Since the Lunar New Year, the wars in the Northeast and North China have not eased due to the cold weather. Instead, the communist bandits have intensified their attacks in the icy and snowy conditions. In the Northeast, the communist bandits launched their seventh offensive against Shenyang, coming on fiercely. Fortunately, our loyal and brave soldiers, in the line of Zhangwu and Xinlitun in western Liaoning, defeated the right wing of the communist bandits, turning their seventh offensive into a bubble. Although the war has been quieter in the past few days, it still presents a situation of outward expansion and inner tension. The main force of the communist bandits is currently shifting from the triangular area of ​​Xi'an, Meihekou, and Qingyuan to Faku, Xinmin, and other places, attempting to threaten the Beining Railway, thereby besieging Shenyang. In North China, the flames of war once spread to the outskirts of Tianjin, and Xiaozhan, an important stronghold in its southeast, was once infiltrated by the communist bandits. The communist bandits also attempted to take advantage of the situation to harass Tanggu, but after three days and nights of hard fighting by the National Army, Xiaozhan was finally recovered, removing the threat to the outskirts of Tianjin. However, the communist bandits' ambition to harass has not died, and they are still making trouble there, so the crisis in North China has not really been eliminated. Although we are unwilling to deny the seriousness of the situation, we have not lost our confidence in suppressing the bandits and quelling the chaos.</p>
<p>Chairman Chiang flew to Beiping and then to Shenyang on the 10th of this month, and it is hoped that the war situation in the Northeast and North China will stabilize in the shortest possible time. Moreover, military actions to suppress bandits and quell chaos must advance without retreat. From a national perspective, the recent convening of the Army Training Conference, presided over by Chairman Chiang himself, has decided to divide the country into eight new recruit training centers, with Beiping and Shenyang being two of the eight centers. If we look at the Northeast and North China, the saying that the Generalissimo Headquarters will move to Beiping has been clamoring in recent days. Moreover, in order to ensure the transportation on the Beining Railway and eliminate the communist bandits in the border area of ​​Hebei, Rehe, and Liaoning, the National Army has decided to set up a command structure in western Liaoning, with General Fan Hanjie in charge. Therefore, Chu Xichun, the newly appointed Chairman of the Hebei Provincial Government, recently stated: "The National Army will never give up Changji, and the Beining Railway will soon be opened." These two sentences are definitely not empty words, and facts can prove this in the near future.</p>
<p>Looking around the national war situation, the current military focus is still in the North (including the Northeast and North China). I remember that in the spring of last year, the communist bandits had the arrogant ambition to "ensure the Northeast, consolidate North China, and develop Central China." For a year, the troops of the communist bandits Liu Bocheng, Chen Geng, and Chen Yi have been scurrying east and west in Central China, attempting to implement their so-called "conspiracy to develop Central China." Everyone knows that Central China is the heart of the government. If it becomes a bandit's roaming area, the entire situation will be extremely serious. However, since the establishment of the Jiujiang Command Post of the Ministry of National Defense, the military affairs of Central China have been assigned to General Bai Chongxi to be responsible for commanding them, and therefore all difficulties have been overcome. Recently, because the communist bandits' plan to roam failed, they vented their anger on the United States and even massacred American female missionaries. From this point alone, it can be seen that the troops of Liu Bocheng, Chen Geng, and Chen Yi are certainly more than capable of killing ordinary people while running east and west, but they will never succeed in developing Central China. Therefore, we believe that the military focus today is still in the North, and we want to ask readers to pay close attention to the development of the war situation in the North. We must also know that the gains and losses of the military to suppress the bandits in the North are too important to the future of the entire effort to quell the chaos and build the country. Some defeatists create rumors of abandoning the Northeast, which are not worth readers laughing at.</p>
<p>Recently, the Central Government has issued a general order to the troops to pay attention to and value economic strongholds. This is indeed the most valuable instruction in the work of quelling the chaos. The strategy adopted by the communist bandits since the victory of the Anti-Japanese War can be summed up in one sentence, which is the four words "calling troops to rebel." In addition to expanding their territory by force, they also want to destroy domestic transportation, causing the country's production to stagnate, thereby promoting the collapse of the government in financial and economic aspects. U.S. Secretary of State Marshall came to China to mediate, and in less than a month, he saw through the communist bandits' conspiracy to drag down the government by means of war. Therefore, for the government, the only fundamental way to suppress bandits and quell chaos lies in military and economic aspects, working together and complementing each other, so that it can achieve twice the result with half the effort. It can even be said that economic quelling of chaos is more important than military affairs. We have read the government's recent instructions and can be more confident and justified.</p>
<p>Based on this, the economic value of the North, such as the soybeans of the Northeast, the coal mines of Beiping and Tianjin, the cotton of Shijiazhuang, the tobacco leaves of Xuchang, and the wheat of Shandong, are all important materials for the national economy and people's livelihood. The National Army must pay attention to striving for them. The reason why the communist bandits want to "ensure the Northeast and consolidate North China" is also based on this. Therefore, the National Army must implement the purpose of this instruction in the future. Only in this way do we expect that the war in the North in the next month or two will be a war to compete for cotton. According to experts' estimates, the cotton harvest in the North last autumn may be 12 million dan, of which only one-third has been purchased by the government, and the remaining two-thirds are still waiting to be snapped up. This depends on the coordination of military power, which goes without saying.</p>
<p>In short, we observe the evolution of the national situation and have to call on the whole country to step up the work of suppressing bandits and quelling chaos. In the current stage, on the one hand, the National Army must pay attention to the North. The Northeast and North China are our lifeline, and we must never give them up lightly. To be honest, without the Northeast, there is no North China; without North China, there is no Central China. We must never be defeatists and want to be content with temporary peace. On the other hand, we must also face the crisis in Central China. The Jiang, Huai, He, and Han are indeed a vast plain, but there are also many mountains in Dabie, Dahong, Tongbai, and Wudang, which can be used as bandit hideouts. At present, we should take advantage of the communist bandits' unstable foothold in Central China to give them a head-on blow. On the active side, we should encircle and annihilate the communist bandits; on the passive side, we should at least consolidate the river defense and strictly guard the Sichuan border, so as to prevent the communist bandits from realizing their delusion of crossing the river or entering Sichuan to expand the scope of the roaming army.</p>

The complete removal of unequal shackles is a basic national policy. The Kowloon leased territory will eventually be recovered, which is only a matter of time. If we file a negotiation at the appropriate time, our friendly country Britain will surely be happy to agree.

However, the Far East Committee repeatedly stated that the ships of the Water Transport Team, as well as all equipment and materials transferred by the UNRRA to the post-relief mechanism, must not be used for military purposes, but should be used for post-relief and reconstruction. Otherwise, the Post-War Affairs Committee of the Executive Yuan can recover the original items at cost.</p>
<p>[Another Dispatch] The 15 branch offices of the UNRRA Administration in various places are rushing to complete the closing work. It is reported that the Zhejiang, Fujian, and Taiwan branch offices have been officially closed, and the remaining branch offices will also be closed in succession in the short term. As for the closing work of the UNRRA Administration headquarters, the government has limited it to be completed within five months, and it is expected to be completed on schedule.</p>
<h3 id="e28">43,000 Tons of Rice to be Shipped from the U.S. to China <a href="#e28" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c28" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">28</a></h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Washington, 14th] Chinese diplomatic circles here told the Associated Press that they deeply hope that 43,000 tons of rice will be able to leave the U.S. port and be shipped to China within the next two or three weeks. They said that this rice is US$30 million, which is planned to be supplied to China after the end of the UNRRA. This is because of procurement difficulties, and the relief supplies that have not been delivered to China before. It is reported that these difficulties have also stopped the delivery of medical relief supplies to China after the end of the UNRRA. In addition, the rice worth US$30,000 agreed upon by China and the UNRRA after the end of the UNRRA to purchase from Siam has not yet been shipped to China, but it is deeply hoped that the rice can leave Siam and be shipped to China within a month or six weeks. Well-informed sources said that the coup in Siam was one of the reasons for the delay in shipping the rice. Chinese diplomats said that in the UNRRA post-completion plan, the actual food delivered to China so far is only 16,219 tons of flour and wheat. The plan also stipulates the supply of medicines, some of which must be obtained from countries other than the United States. At the same time, it was also heard that the U.S. Department of State is making preliminary decisions on the various types of goods supplied to China under the 18 million yuan temporary relief plan. Well-informed sources said that these funds will be used to purchase food, fertilizer, medical relief supplies, cotton, oil, and plant seeds (mainly cotton seeds), but when this plan will take effect after the procurement of the products is completed is unclear.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 14th, Associated Press] It has been learned that the International Emergency Food Conference has increased the amount of rice allocated to China in the first half of this year by 4,500 tons, so the total number has reached 204,600 tons.</p>
<h3 id="e29">Henan Educational Personnel Are Successively Withdrawing; Air Transport to Laohekou Is Problematic <a href="#e29" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c29" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">29</a></h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch] According to news from church sources in this city: the Zhengzhou Southern Church Hospital, a large-scale facility with 100 beds, began withdrawing from the 14th to avoid the threat of bandit troops. The church plane "St. Paul" has already transported the first batch of hospital equipment and the hospital director, Ennis. Director Ennis said that the hospital will be moved to Guilin. The main equipment in the hospital will be airlifted to Hankou by St. Paul first, and then transported to the destination. In addition to equipment, the church plane also transported several Swedish female missionaries from Zhengzhou. Most of them came from Luoyang. The church personnel in Zhengzhou are now gathering at the airport, waiting for air transport. An old American missionary, who experienced the great disaster of 1927, sighed, "In today's situation, I am afraid that all of us will withdraw from China."</p>
<p>Before the withdrawal of the Zhengzhou Southern Hospital, the Xinyihui Church Hospital in Queshan was moved in advance because the county was under fierce attack by bandit troops, and the hospital site and its staff dormitory were severely damaged. Dr. Fant, the person in charge of the hospital, later told people: Three divisions of bandit troops once attacked the hospital site. With the help of the elite artillery of the group wall, they bravely repelled the bandits with a small number of people. There is truly much to be praised for their bravery. Those who broke through with Fant included his wife and three American nurses. They all boarded a military plane carrying parachutes and left the city. After reaching a safe location, they took the Pinghan Railway to Hankou.</p>
<p>As for the Laohekou area, because the 12th Division of Liu Bocheng's bandit troops has crossed the Han River, the military situation is becoming increasingly urgent. Foreign missionaries in the area have been concentrated, waiting for planes to withdraw to Hankou. The "St. Paul" was originally scheduled to fly to Laohekou yesterday, but it is now known that it did not happen due to technical problems. Because the ground equipment of the Laohekou military airport was dismantled and moved a week ago, the pilot of the St. Paul believes that it is not advisable to risk landing before ground contact is restored. Several weeks ago, the American Embassy in Nanjing requested our government to allow the church plane to land at Laohekou Airport in order to evacuate the missionaries. At that time, it was not approved due to military relations. The current situation of the missionaries in that area has caused anxiety among the churches here.</p>

<h3 id="e47">Draft of Implementation Measures for the Financial Portion of the Economic Program: Full Text <a href="#e47" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c47" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">47</a></h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch, Nanjing, 15th] The draft of implementation measures for the financial portion of the economic reform program has been formulated, and is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>I. Consolidating Public Finance</p>
<p>Original Plan (1): The public revenue and expenditure system should be revised, and provincial financial resources should be increased to achieve self-sufficiency. The statutory taxes of counties and cities should be reorganized to strictly prohibit illegal apportionment, so that local finances can be developed soundly to meet the needs of local construction.</p>
<p>Implementation measures:</p>
<p>A. Revision of the revenue and expenditure system:</p>
<p>The current public revenue and expenditure system is a three-level system. After the decision on this draft, the national public revenue and expenditure will be divided into two major systems: the central public finance and the local public finance. The local public finance will be further divided into two levels: (1) provinces and municipalities directly under the central government, and special administrative regions; (2) counties, municipalities under the jurisdiction of provinces, or establishments equivalent to counties and cities. As for the division of tax sources between the central government, local (provinces and cities), and counties (municipal bureaus), during the period of national mobilization to suppress the rebellion, the current public revenue and expenditure system will still be temporarily followed. However, it is proposed to allocate to the localities in advance the central tax revenues that are suitable for profit-sharing to subsidize the localities, or for the localities to collect on behalf of the central government (detailed measures will be given later). It is also proposed to transfer all land tax revenues to the localities after the implementation of the constitution in order to increase local financial resources.</p>
<p>B. Enriching provincial (municipal) finances:</p>
<p>(1) Land tax. After the implementation of the constitution, the land tax is proposed to be changed to a local tax, with provinces and counties each accounting for 50% of the income. Municipalities directly under the central government will still contribute 40% to the central government. Before the implementation of the constitution, it will still be a tax shared by the central government, provinces, and counties. The proportion will still be handled according to the current method. (2) Public grain collected with taxes. It is proposed to allocate 50% of the local public grain collected with taxes to each province and county. However, the province should use half of the income to coordinate the surpluses and deficits of the counties and cities within the province. (3) Business tax. It is proposed to allocate all of the business tax to the provincial finances. Except that municipalities under provincial jurisdiction should still be given 50%, 50% will be exempted from being distributed to counties. The proportion of contributions to the central government by municipalities directly under the central government will still be handled according to the current method before the implementation of the constitution. After the implementation of the constitution, all of it will be classified as the income of municipalities directly under the central government, and its tax rate will be increased separately. For those who pay taxes according to the amount of business income, it is proposed to increase it from 1.5% to 3%. For those who pay taxes according to the amount of business profit, it is proposed to increase it from 4% to 6%. (4) Deed tax. It is proposed to classify all of this income as county and city income, and the additional income originally belonging to counties and cities will be changed to provincial income. (5) Special taxes. It is proposed to allow municipalities directly under the central government to levy special taxes in accordance with the law based on the actual needs of the local area.</p>
<p>C. Reorganization of county finances:</p>
<p>It is proposed to start with three items in the reorganization of county finances, which will be described separately as follows: (A) Increase in tax allocation: (1) Inheritance tax. Increase the proportion of inheritance tax allocated to counties and cities. It is proposed to increase the ratio from 30% to 70%, and stipulate methods for county and municipal governments to assist in tax collection. (2) Local tobacco and local wine tax. It is proposed that the central government entrust counties and cities to collect taxes on its behalf, and allocate 50% of the income to counties and cities. The methods for assisting in tax collection are also proposed to be revised immediately. (B) Adjustment of tax rates: (1) Tax rates for various donations and taxes. The tax rates for housing donations, business license tax, user license tax, slaughter tax, banquet donations, entertainment donations, deed tax, etc. are proposed to be increased separately, and the methods of collection are improved. (Detailed measures for this item have recently been approved by the Executive Yuan by a special project of this department, and are now in the process of completing the legislative procedures.) (2) Farmland tax rate. Adjust the farmland tax rate and registers to equally bear the tax, investigate different places, and increase income. The measures for this plan will be drafted by this department jointly with the Ministry of Food and the Ministry of Land Administration, and will be submitted for approval and implementation. (C) Increase in tax sources:</p>
<p>(1) Special taxes. Any reliable donations and taxes that people are willing to pay or that do not harm the livelihood of the local people (such as livestock tax in the Northwest, marine products in the Southeast, medicinal materials and special crops in the mountainous areas, etc.). Localities will be allowed to handle or organize them in accordance with legal procedures, and they will be recognized as legal taxes in the locality.</p>
<p>D. Enriching township finances:</p>
<p>(1) Setting up guaranteed fields. The income from at least 30 mu of guaranteed fields per bao (unit) is designated as the township baojia (security system) fund, and land without owners and land collected in accordance with the law will be allocated to it. (2) Enriching township education funds, holding a study valley donation with the approval of the public opinion organ, and designating 50% of the township's publicly owned funds and production income as township education funds. (3) Strictly implement the regulation that township expenses account for more than 50% of the county budget.</p>
<p>E. Prohibition of illegal apportionment:</p>
<p>(1) All counties and cities should effectively implement local general budgets, and there should be no other income and expenditure. If new local undertakings need to be carried out, the supplementary income and expenditure budget should be handled in accordance with the law first, and it can be implemented only after it is approved. (2) For undertakings that do not belong to local autonomy, such as those entrusted by the central government or the province, the expenses should be allocated by the entrusting agency. (3) Any organization that illegally collects taxes on a regular basis shall not directly collect any money or goods from the people. Those who violate this shall be dealt with in accordance with Article 129 of the Criminal Law. (4) Formulate measures for counties and cities to develop special taxes to restrict local apportionment.</p>
<p>Original Plan (2): The tax rates of direct, commodity, customs, and salt taxes should be carefully adjusted in light of the people's ability to pay taxes in order to increase the national treasury income and equalize the people's burden.</p>
<p>A. Adjustment of direct tax rates</p>
<p>(A) For income tax, except for the income tax of the first type of profit-making enterprises, which still adopts the full progressive tax rate, the income taxes of the remaining second, third, fourth, and fifth types will all be changed to proportional tax rates to facilitate collection. (B) The income tax threshold and tax rate shall, in accordance with the British system, be determined in light of the national economic situation and the needs of national finance before the start of each year, and shall be submitted to the legislative body for review and promulgation and implementation in order to adapt to fluctuations in prices and the ability of the people to bear the burden. (C) Raise the threshold for inheritance tax and reduce the tax rate. The current tax law stipulates that the current tax law progresses from 2% to 60%. It is proposed to change it from 1% to 25%. As for the tariff level, it is proposed to reduce it from 17 levels to 8 levels to facilitate promotion. (D) Increase the fixed rate of stamp tax. It is proposed to increase it appropriately according to the situation at that time. (E) Change the standard of levying special business tax based on income amount or income amount, so that businesses with high income can bear a higher tax amount to equalize the burden.</p>
<p>B. Commodity Tax</p>
<p>(A) Increase the tax rate on luxury goods. Among commodity taxes, such as cigarettes, foreign wine, local tobacco, local wine, tinfoil, superstitious paper, cosmetics, etc., are all luxury goods, and a tax of 45% to 100% is currently levied on the price. After that, it is still planned to adjust the tax rate in the future based on the price of goods and the ability of merchants to bear the burden. The original tax rates for wheat flour, cotton yarn, coal, iron, and mineral products are all still low, and it is proposed to temporarily not increase them to avoid stimulating prices.</p>
<p>C. Customs Duties</p>
<p>(A) Restore the collection of import taxes on gasoline and diesel, and increase the original import tax rates for diesel, gasoline, and kerosene to 50% of the price (this plan has been submitted to the Executive Yuan for approval and implemented since October 1, 1947). (B) Revise the import tariff in accordance with the tariff principles approved by the government and the obligations accepted by our country at the World Trade and Employment Conference in order to seek the customs revenue medium.</p>
<p>D. Salt Tax</p>
<p>(A) Uniform tax rate: After the victory, the salt tax rate adopted different rates to adapt to the different environments of the recovered areas. There were as many as ten types of rates. After repeated adjustments and simplifications, this year's August has been adjusted again, classified and unified as 100,000 yuan per dan for ordinary edible salt and 80,000 yuan for Tu Gao salt. The national unity, the people bear an average, and the audit and collection are convenient. In the future, it is planned to follow this principle. (B) Adjust the tax rate: The new tax rate adjusted in August is about 16,000 times higher than the average rate before the war, but it is still less than half of the price. In terms of the people's ability to pay taxes, the burden is still light. In the future, it is planned to consider the price changes, the people's ability to pay taxes, and the needs of the treasury expenditures, and continue to discuss the adjustment plan when necessary.</p>
<p>Original Plan (3): Develop new taxes and donations in accordance with the principle of those who have money pay money to meet the needs of nation-building.</p>
<p>Implementation Measures: Hold a special donation for nation-building, stipulating that individual citizens of the Republic of China are the levy target. For individuals with a total amount of wealth of more than 5 billion, the starting tax rate adopts a progressive amount system, from 10% to 50%. The handling procedures are divided into declaration, nomination, accusation, investigation, and assessment. The public opinion organ is responsible for nomination, the local relevant organization is responsible for investigating and estimating the value, and the competent collection authority assesses the donation based on the actual value of the investigated property. Original Plan (4): Adjust the collection agency, strictly control the tax source, and improve the audit procedures to strengthen the efficiency of tax administration and reduce collection costs.</p>
<p>Adjust the collection agency, strictly control the tax source, and improve the audit and collection procedures to strengthen the efficiency of tax administration and reduce collection costs.</p>
<p>Implementation measures:</p>
<p>A. Adjustment of the organization</p>
<p>A. Direct tax: (A) Strengthen the base branch, enrich the manpower tax source, and do not salt the collection fee. All branches with more than 30% of the tax revenue will be merged to save expenses. (B) Considering the tax revenue situation, the provincial and regional agencies will be merged. Recently, Guizhou and Shandong provinces have a shortage of tax sources. The Guizhou Direct Tax Bureau has been merged with Yunnan into the Yun-Gui Direct Tax Bureau, and the Shandong Direct Tax Bureau has been merged with the Henan District into the Lu-Yu Direct Tax Bureau.</p>
<p>(B) Commodity Tax: (A) All branches and county offices with a ratio of income and expenditure exceeding 30%, and factory and mine personnel with a ratio of income and expenditure exceeding 20%, will be closed or reduced in number at any time to save expenses. (B) Considering the tax revenue situation, the provincial and regional agencies will be merged. Recently, the Guizhou Commodity Tax Bureau has been merged with Yunnan into the Yun-Gui Commodity Tax Bureau.</p>
<p>C. Customs duties: In order to meet the needs of audit and collection and prevent private transportation in South China, it is planned to adjust the branch institutions as follows: (1) Huludao Branch Customs, which belongs to Qinhuangdao, will be changed to the jurisdiction of Yingkou Customs. (2) Taipei Customs will be moved to Keelung. (3) Change Wuzhou Customs to a branch Customs under the jurisdiction of Guangdong Customs. (4) Nanning Customs will be abolished. (5) Longzhou Branch Customs will be upgraded to a General Customs. (6) Beihai Branch Customs will be upgraded to a General Customs. (7) A branch Customs will be added to the lower reaches of the Yangtze River, under the jurisdiction of Jianghai Customs. (8) In Jiulong Customs, four branch Customs and eleven branch offices will be added in the areas of Baisezhou, Yantian, Shayupu, and Nanao in the district, and guard posts will be set up in the cargo-important areas between the branch Customs to specialize in observation and investigate private salt. (9) A branch Customs will be added to the Guanwan area outside Hong Kong. (10) A branch Customs will be added to the Qinglong Mountain area outside Macau.</p>
<p>D. Salt: (A) Cut and merge inspection cards. After the victory, the salt affairs policy focused on abandoning the actual production area, shrinking the sales area, and cutting and merging inspection cards as much as possible. Since its implementation, more than 600 agencies have been cut and merged one after another. (B) Reduce troops in the sales area. After the sales area is reduced, the salt police forces originally stationed in the sales area have also been reduced to the minimum. (To be continued)</p>
<h3 id="e48">The Repayment Ability of Western European Aid Recipients: US State Department Submits Report, Categorizing Repayments into Grants, Loans, and Cash <a href="#e48" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c48" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">48</a></h3>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 14th] The State Department today released new figures regarding the Marshall Plan, covering the imports and exports, production, and political situations of each participating country, but without disclosing the amount and method of US aid allocation. State Department officials also stated that they have decided that aid to Greece and Austria should be in the form of purchases; aid to Britain, France, Italy, the Netherlands, Luxembourg, Denmark, and Iceland should be partly in the form of grants and partly in goods; aid to Ireland, Sweden, and Norway should be in the form of loans; and goods provided to Switzerland, Portugal, and Turkey must be repaid in cash. The following is a breakdown of the parts concerning each country mentioned in the State Department report:</p>
<p>Britain: During and after the implementation of the European Recovery Program, rationing of food, clothing, and gasoline in Britain will continue. Britain's gold and dollar reserves currently total approximately $2 billion, but by the end of 1948, they will be only half that amount. A dollar trade deficit will continue for several years, and Britain's external payments are expected to be balanced around 1952. Regarding food, it will take until at least 1952 to restore pre-war levels. Britain's current control system will continue to exist before 1952, and the pound may depreciate. Politically, the State Department believes that there is no fundamental difference between the foreign policies of the Labour and Conservative parties. Within the Labour Party, there are left-leaning and centrist factions. The Communist Party's influence in Britain is extremely weak. Britain's overseas territories are of great help in assisting Britain's recovery and balance of payments.</p>
<p>France: The success of the Schumann government and its political rivals' struggles and the completion of its strong economic policies will be difficult to achieve within a few years without foreign aid. The key to France's parliament and Western Europe is whether to allow the French economy to collapse, establishing a communist dictatorship in the chaos, or to strengthen the forces of democracy in Western Europe. Currently, the French government has a breathing space, which is due to General de Gaulle's unwillingness to retake power during the winter and the fact that many parliamentarians do not dare to overthrow the interim government before the Communist Party's power is broken.</p>
<p>Greece: The State Department believes that there is no doubt about the legitimacy of the current Greek government. Only one-third of the guerrillas are true communists, and the rest are fugitives. Therefore, if the strength of the guerrillas can be reduced and internal stability established, then the Greek government's economic recovery plan and the aid currently provided by the United States can form the basis for a minimal recovery. If guerrilla activities can be stopped, the people's living standards can be maintained. Communism began to expand in Greece during the chaotic conditions after the war. If Greece obtains a stable economic and necessary construction base, it can maintain independence and safeguard a free and independent system. However, if the People's Party or the Liberal Party withdraw from the current coalition government, it will be difficult to form a stable government.</p>
<p>After the Implementation of the Marshall Plan, the Living Standards of Germans Remain Low: Currency Reform in the British-American Zone Is Inevitable</p>
<p>Germany: After the completion of the Marshall Plan, the standard of living in Germany will continue to be tight. Consumption will remain lower than before the war. Only the per capita consumption of tobacco and sugar is expected to reach 70% of pre-war levels. Meat consumption will be only 60% of pre-war levels, and oil consumption will be only 40% of pre-war levels. The report also stated that a new currency must be adopted in the British-American zone of Germany to greatly reduce the circulation of banknotes. If the four powers do not reach an agreement on reforming the currency system for all of Germany, currency reform in the British-American zone is inevitable.</p>
<p>Italy: The State Department believes that the absorption of Italy's surplus labor by other countries is a necessary condition for its economic stability. The main causes of Italy's economic difficulties are rapid population growth, food shortages, inflation, and widespread unemployment. Politically, the State Department believes that the recent strengthening of centrist political forces in Italy is due to the people's aversion to the unrest stirred up by the Communist Party and some unfriendly actions taken by the Soviet Union. However, the existence of a moderate Italian government still depends on improving its severe economic situation.</p>
<p>Turkey: Turkey was not affected by the war, and its government can maintain a consensus on foreign policy. Therefore, the economic recovery problems it faces are different from those of most European countries. Since 1945, Turkey has been under constant external pressure, forcing the government to maintain a standing army of 600,000, which has caused serious financial and human resource problems. It is expected that after the completion of the Marshall Plan, Turkey's foreign trade will greatly increase, and the imports it receives under the aid program will not be difficult to repay in cash.</p>
<p>Switzerland: The State Department suggests that Switzerland contribute to the Marshall Plan by lending its gold and foreign exchange to other countries under the Marshall Plan. The report believes that Switzerland has the highest standard of living in Europe, and its government's stability is not threatened by any political or economic problems. The State Department also believes that Switzerland, Portugal, and Turkey do not need financial assistance, and even if there is a trade deficit, it is extremely small.</p>

<p>[Reuters, London, 15th] A British Foreign Office spokesman said that the meeting of the sixteen European nations is unlikely to reopen, which would cause inconvenience to the US government. The spokesman's remarks were intended to respond to US Under Secretary of State Robert Lovett's statement in Washington yesterday that it is not appropriate to reopen the meeting of the sixteen nations before the US Congress concludes its debate on the Marshall Plan. It is expected that the invitation that Britain will issue to the other fourteen nations after the talks in London will not specify a date for the reopening of the meeting.</p>

<p>[US New Agency, Washington, 14th] A State Department spokesman said today that how much US aid the countries of Western Europe will receive in the European Recovery Program has not yet been decided. The spokesman's statement was in response to a question regarding news contained in the New York Times and other reports. The statement read: "No decisions have been made to date regarding the amount or method of financial assistance to European countries. This matter must be decided after Congress takes action, and the administrator of the European Recovery Program, under the advice of the government, will consult with the National Advisory Council and make decisions based on the facts at any time. Any estimates regarding the amount or method of assistance at present can only be regarded as speculation."</p>

<p>[Our Report] New York, 15th broadcast, Washington report. US government military authorities Royal and Forrestal today told the Senate Foreign Relations Committee that the purpose of the Marshall Plan is to prevent war. If Congress does not approve the Marshall Plan, it is necessary to immediately strengthen national defense. The government is requesting $6.8 billion for the first fifteen months of implementing the Marshall Plan. If our country has to greatly strengthen national defense due to the deterioration of the European situation, the cost will be far higher than this figure.</p>

<p>[Reuters, Berlin, 14th] The "Berlin Post," registered with the French authorities, stated that the Ruhr area recently discovered a Communist plot to cause Ruhr industry to stagnate in order to undermine the Marshall Plan. According to reports, the German Communist Party has a so-called "M Plan," which states that the key point of the winter battle is to defeat the offensive of the monopolistic capitalism and imperialistic Marshall Plan. The newspaper also stated that the nine-nation Communist Information Bureau in Belgrade has been responsible for coordinating socialist movements in Europe to jointly resist the Marshall Plan. The plan includes launching simultaneous strikes in the transportation and production industries, scheduled to complete preparations by the end of February 1948, and launch in early March.</p>
<p>[United Press, Berlin, 15th] After newspapers under Soviet control threatened to ask Britain and the United States to withdraw from Berlin, and the US military government replied that it would not consider changing the four-power joint administration of Berlin, German trade union leaders in the Ruhr area today threatened a general strike of four million workers. According to reports from Frankfurt, railway workers in the western zone also have the intention to strike.</p>

<p>[Reuters, London, 14th] Twenty-four hours before the Security Council began the debate on the Kashmir case, political figures here revealed a certain conspiracy to undermine the resolution of the Kashmir issue. The Soviet trade union newspaper "Trud" published an article on January 11, pointing out that Britain and the United States, with imperialistic intentions, are attempting to break the relationship between the two dominions of India and Pakistan. The newspaper stated that Britain and Pakistan have a secret agreement that allows Britain to maintain bases in Pakistan, and also accused Indian Governor-General Mountbatten of instigating Kashmir's annexation to India. It also said that the invasion of Kashmir by tribesmen from the Northwest Frontier Province was instigated by British spies. The newspaper further accused the British government of implementing a "divide and rule" policy in the Indian peninsula in order to establish a new form of rule in the two dominions of India and Pakistan. While denying the aforementioned accusations, government officials here stated that the British government will do its best in the Security Council to ensure that the issue is resolved peacefully and quickly.</p>

<p>[New Asia News Agency, Tokyo, 15th] Japanese Socialist Party cabinet ministers Katayama, Nishio, Mizutani, Suzuki, etc., met at the Prime Minister's official residence yesterday afternoon to discuss the Socialist Party's countermeasures after Hirano's purge. It is rumored that they believe that the purge of Hirano can temporarily stabilize the political situation, and the forces of the three ruling parties can be used to overcome the difficulties of the political situation.</p>
<p>[New Asia News Agency, Tokyo, 15th] As the Socialist Party is scheduled to convene a congress tomorrow, various factions have been actively engaged. For example, the centrist Thursday Society held a meeting yesterday, deciding to appoint the current ministers as central committee members, Katayama as chairman, and Asanuma as secretary-general. As for policy, they will not be constrained by the three-party coalition and will strongly implement socialist policies that are suitable for the current situation. On the other hand, the left-wing commissioners also held a meeting yesterday, deciding to abandon the four-party policy agreement and oppose appointing the current ministers as central committee members, only considering them as advisors, and nominating Kato Kanju as secretary-general. If the congress fails to pass the left-wing's nomination for secretary-general, the faction will declare that it will take free action when electing the chairman. In addition, a proposal was made to the Thursday Society that if it agrees with its claim to abolish the four-party agreement, it will agree to nominate Katayama as chairman. However, the Thursday Society has not yet responded.</p>

<p>We only need to recall that the First World War originated in continental Europe, and that the Second World War also used Europe as one of its main battlefields, to imagine that even today, when the world's financial center and international organizations have moved to New York, continental Europe still retains its important position on the international political stage. Learning from the past to understand the future, our review of the European situation in 1947 can greatly enhance our understanding of the European continent, as well as the world political situation in 1948 and beyond.</p>
<p>Logically speaking, 1947 should have been a very important year for continental Europe, because during this year, it should have laid the foundation for long-term peace on the European continent. In fact, whether it achieved this or not, continental Europe did indeed have some extraordinary events during this year. Let's start with a simple "chronicle of events."</p>
<p>March 10 to April 24, 1947: The foreign ministers of the United Kingdom, the United States, the Soviet Union, and France met in Moscow to discuss the issues of Germany and Austria, but dispersed without any results.</p>
<p>June 5: US Secretary of State Marshall gave a speech at Harvard, explaining the US economic aid plan for Europe. (Although this matter and the following item 8 did not occur in continental Europe, they were closely related to continental Europe.)</p>
<p>July 12: Sixteen European countries held the European Economic Cooperation Conference in Paris.</p>
<p>September 22: The report of the European Economic Cooperation Committee was signed in Paris.</p>
<p>October 5: The establishment of the Cominform (Communist Information Bureau) was officially announced in Belgrade.</p>
<p>November 25: The foreign ministers of the United Kingdom, the United States, the Soviet Union, and France met in London to discuss the issues of Germany and Austria, but dispersed on December 15 without any results.</p>
<p>December 17: The United Kingdom and the United States signed an agreement on the allocation of expenses in the German occupation zones.</p>
<p>December 19: The US Congress passed the emergency relief portion of the Marshall Plan for economic aid to Europe.</p>
<p>December 24: The Greek Communist Party announced the establishment of a provisional government to resist the current Greek government.</p>
<p>December 30: Romanian King Michael announced his abdication, and Romania established the "People's Republic."</p>
<p>Of course, the above list is only a part of the major events in continental Europe in 1947. Other events, such as the cabinet crises and labor strikes in France, and the political prisons in Eastern European countries, I cannot record one by one. However, even these events are enough to represent the situation in continental Europe in 1947. If we observe the above facts individually, they may not seem very important, or their importance may not be obvious. But if we connect them together, they indeed reflect the mainstream of the situation in continental Europe over the past year.</p>
<p>Purely from the surface of the facts, the problem in continental Europe centers around the German question. The repeatedly held meetings of the four foreign ministers also focused on the German question. Among the German issues, although there were issues such as the eastern border of Germany, reparations, and the future German government, the most important issue was that the Soviet Union hoped for a pro-Soviet, or similar to the current Eastern European countries, Germany, while the United Kingdom and the United States hoped for a Germany that accepted so-called "Western culture." Furthermore, with Eastern Europe already de facto a Soviet sphere of influence, the future of Germany will determine the fate of continental Europe. Thus, the failure to resolve the German issue has intensified mutual suspicion between the United States and the Soviet Union. After the four foreign ministers' conference in the spring of 1947 ended without results, both sides were playing chess. The motive behind the Marshall Plan may have been to prevent the spread of communism in Europe, or it may have been to find an outlet for America's surplus productivity, but in any case, it required a stable Europe and opened a door for international cooperation. The refusal of the Soviet Union and Eastern European countries to participate confirmed the dividing line between Western and Eastern Europe. Developing along the lines of the Marshall Plan was the economic conference of sixteen Western European countries. Although the establishment of the Cominform was said to be for the exchange of information, it was actually more or less a reincarnation of the Third International, and at the same time, it was also meant to counter the Marshall Plan. These preludes had already determined the fate of the failed four foreign ministers' conference in London in November. The failure of the London conference further promoted the cooperation between the United Kingdom and the United States in western Germany and the US Congress's passage of the emergency relief portion of the Marshall Plan. Under these circumstances, the Greek Communist Party, whether by order or spontaneously, took advantage of the increasing formation of the two blocs to announce the establishment of a government, and the King of Romania abdicated in order to consolidate the situation in Eastern Europe early. This development clearly showed the clear opposition between the two blocs, led by the United States and the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>This situation has a very negative impact on 1948. The problems that were not resolved in 1946 not only could not be resolved in 1947 to lay a foundation for peace in continental Europe, but it seemed to make the problem even more "rigid." The Moscow conference in the spring of 1947 was decided in advance, while the London conference in the winter of 1947 failed to schedule a meeting for this year, which is indeed a great misfortune.</p>
<p>Recalling the period after the First World War, although the handling of every international issue was not satisfactory and did not lay the foundation for peace, there was no such stalemate as today. The main problem is not because the Soviet Union has replaced the position of France after the First World War, but because the Soviet Union, due to its special beliefs and economic system, hopes to have an infinitely large security circle. If we look at the European continent in 1948 from this point of view, the future is naturally very pessimistic. We see that both sides have openly accused each other, which makes it impossible for us to imagine that the problems that could not be solved in 1947 can be solved in 1948. Some people even fear that 1948 will become like 1914 or 1939. However, if we think about it calmly, 1948 may be a very rigid year, but if we say that a global war will break out, that would be too pessimistic. First, the Soviet Union's policy, whether for its own security or for its own expansion, is conducive to a policy of "nibbling"; in other words, it is conducive to gradual expansion, but not necessarily conducive to "war." Under this policy, continental Europe may be very unstable, and the Communist Party may create political turmoil, labor strikes, and even all kinds of panic in various countries, but it may not immediately create war. Second, after the Soviet Union fought against Germany, it was severely weakened. It is said that 1946 was still a year of famine, and the five-year plan after the war has not been completed. Obviously, if there is a war, it must be a long-term war. I don't think the Soviet government has the confidence to support another long-term war today. Third, the Eastern European countries on the periphery of the Soviet Union have not yet recovered economically, and are not yet stable politically. It seems that they cannot yet be used as war capital. On the British and American side, Britain's current situation, economically speaking, it absolutely does not want to and cannot support an international war at the same time. Although the United States has an advantage in terms of materials, and is geographically distant, the countries in Europe that can be allies of the United States have very limited strength. Under these circumstances, it is also incredible to say that the United States will launch a war. Of course, this is an estimate based on the interests of both sides. The outbreak of war often carries a sense of "accident." In the First World War, the assassination of the crown prince, and in the Second World War, Hitler's attack on the East, etc., no one ever thought that it would cause such a protracted war. Therefore, when neither side has confidence, the possibility of war is still very small. I am in a position to assess the situation. The European continent in 1948 may be a situation of tension. On the one hand, it is trying to stabilize Western Europe, and on the other hand, it is consolidating Eastern Europe. It is possible that there will be many unresolved problems, and it is also possible that there will be turmoil and unrest within some countries. (Sent from London on January 5, 1948)</p>

<h3 id="e66">Police Officer of the Sichuan Road Police Station Detained, Disputes at Tongji University Expand, Principal Ding Subsequently Denies Summoning Police to the School to Suppress Students, City Police Bureau States That It Will File a Lawsuit <a href="#e66" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c66" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">66</a></h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Report] Disputes over the re-election of the Student Union at National Tongji University suddenly escalated yesterday. The reason for this is that after the school was ordered the day before yesterday to publicly announce the Student Union charter promulgated by the Ministry of Education, some students, Du Shoubai and He Changcheng, dissatisfied with the content of the announcement, tore up the announcement. The authorities believed that the students had destroyed public property and disrespected teachers, and thus expelled Du and He from the school. After this incident occurred, more than 1,600 students from all colleges of the school gathered at the law school square on North Sichuan Road from morning to evening yesterday to petition Principal Ding Wenyuan, demanding two points: 1. Recognition of the Student Representatives Congress elected by universal suffrage in the current session. 2. Rescinding the order to expel Du Shoubai and He Changcheng, directors of the previous Student Union. Mr. Ding initially refused to consider it. Until 5 p.m. yesterday, he negotiated with student representatives, but no agreement was reached. However, Mr. Ding had agreed to convene a guidance meeting at 2 p.m. today to reconsider. Regarding the legality of the Student Union elected by universal suffrage, Mr. Ding said that it must be handled in accordance with the regulations of the ministry's charter. If students have any opinions, they can provide them in writing so that they can be forwarded to the Ministry of Education for review. At this point, the students returned to their colleges separately, waiting for the decision of today's guidance meeting.</p>
<p>At around 11 a.m. yesterday, while the students of the school were collectively petitioning Principal Ding, a middle-aged man with suspicious behavior was suddenly discovered in the school's general affairs office, holding a telephone receiver and talking to the outside. They immediately went forward to detain him and searched the following items from him: a No. 3599 handgun, containing seven bullets; a Shanghai Police Bureau No. 1318 badge; a North Sichuan Road Police Station No. 1196 section member symbol; an order from Director Zeng of the bureau appointing Cai Yanzuo to temporarily act as the chief of the judicial section; a national identity card, stating Cai Yanzuo, 35 years old, from Guangdong, with a photo of himself attached; a Tongji University No. 1199 school badge; and two tickets for the North District School Famine Relief and Winter Relief Celebration Evening. The students of the school then convened an emergency meeting of representatives from each department at 2 p.m. yesterday, resolving to protest to the school authorities. At the same time, Cai Yanzuo was transferred to the District Prosecutor's Office to request an investigation.</p>
<p>According to news from the District Prosecutor's Office, after an investigation by the prosecutor, Cai Yanzuo was indeed an employee of the North Sichuan Road Police Sub-bureau. Because the bureau had received a report that the school's students had gathered, fearing that there would be an accident, they sent Cai to pay attention. For the convenience of action, he was ordered to wear plain clothes for easy access. Cai has requested an injury examination, and as a result, he was ordered to return.</p>
<p>Principal Ding told reporters last night: He denied that he had summoned the police to the school to suppress students yesterday morning, or issued a school badge to allow him to enter the school. However, he said: The police officers of the bureau may have entered the school on their own to prevent the order within the school from becoming chaotic. As for where Cai obtained the school badge, he had no way of knowing. Mr. Ding further said: I will never recognize the student's election this time.</p>
<p>[Another report] It is heard that the police bureau has filed a lawsuit with the District Prosecutor's Office because the students of the school detained a police officer.</p>
<h3 id="e67">City Council Expresses Indignation Over the Unfortunate Incident in Kowloon Walled City, Cables Chairman to Urge Active Negotiations <a href="#e67" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c67" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">67</a></h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Report] The Shanghai City Council sent a special cable to the chairman regarding the Kowloon Walled City incident, stating: "To Chairman Jiang of the National Government in Nanjing: We believe that the integrity of territorial sovereignty and the protection of people's freedom are the basic conditions for establishing a country. After returning from victory, all lands that were lost or leased in the past should be negotiated for recovery separately in order to strengthen the borders. At the first meeting of this council in September 1946, in view of the Hong Kong government spokesperson's denial that Kowloon Walled City was Chinese territory and China's current exercise of jurisdiction in the area, it was immediately resolved to petition the central government to actively negotiate the recovery of Hong Kong, Kowloon, Macau, and other lands ceded, transferred, or leased due to unequal treaties, and was previously submitted to you for review and implementation via telegram (35). Recently, the Hong Kong government has used the imperialistic style of colonial officials, relying on strength to bully the weak, forcibly demolishing all civilian houses in our Kowloon Walled City, arresting representatives, shooting and injuring people, and disregarding our government's protests. While negotiations are underway between China and the United Kingdom, they are expanding the situation, willingly acting as the chief culprit, and wantonly destroying the traditional friendly relations between China and the United Kingdom. Furthermore, in the battle to defend Hong Kong during this World War, our overseas Chinese bravely resisted and showed a spirit of righteousness, which is clear for all to see. And relying on your wise leadership, China and the United Kingdom and other allied nations fought side by side for several years, and finally achieved complete victory. China's contribution cannot be said to be small. Therefore, the Cairo Conference also reached a direct solution in principle regarding the return of Hong Kong to our country. Upon hearing this shocking news, this council, in the midst of immense pain, believes that the land of Hong Kong and Kowloon should immediately implement our country's established policy and actively negotiate in order to achieve the purpose of getting to the root of the problem, so that the blood shed by the compatriots in Kowloon Walled City will not be sacrificed in vain. As for the Hong Kong government officials' atrocities, the responsibility should be investigated and the British government should be required to severely punish the culprits and compensate for the losses suffered by the compatriots in Kowloon Walled City in order to calm public anger and protect national rights. We await your orders to the utmost. Pan Gongzhan, Speaker of the Shanghai City Council, and Xu Ji, Deputy Speaker, kowtow (37) (Zi) (Deleted)"</p>

<p>Yan Huiqing</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper Report] Mr. Yan Huiqing, a member of the National Government (pictured), has decided to participate in the election of the Legislative Yuan in this city as a socially respected person, and has legally signed and submitted his application. Mr. Yan is a senior figure in China's diplomatic circles. He is 72 years old, was born in Shanghai, and graduated from St. John's University. He later went to the University of Virginia in the United States for further studies. After returning to China, he served as a professor at St. John's University and the editor-in-chief of the English Department of the Commercial Press. Later, he entered politics, serving as the Prime Minister of the Cabinet, Minister of Foreign Affairs, Minister of Internal Affairs, and other important positions. He also served as an envoy to Britain, the United States, Germany, and other European countries, attended important international conferences, and became famous at home and abroad. In 1932, when China and the Soviet Union resumed diplomatic relations, Mr. Yan served as the first ambassador to the Soviet Union, making many contributions. Until the eve of the War of Resistance Against Japan, he retired due to health reasons and engaged in various charitable undertakings in his private capacity. In the early days of the Pacific War, when Hong Kong fell to the enemy, although the Japanese tried every means to force him, he remained unyielding. After the victory, he lived in Shanghai, did not ask about politics, and devoted himself to industry and education, serving as the chairman of the Shanghai Cement Industry Association and a director of St. John's University. Until last winter, the authorities, in order to gather opinions and overcome national difficulties together, appointed him as a member of the National Government.</p>

<h3 id="e71">It Is Not Easy to Marry and Find the Right Partner, Afraid of Abandonment and Abuse, It Is Easy to Solve One's Own Problems, But Difficult to Feed the Whole Family <a href="#e71" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c71" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">71</a></h3>
<p>(The above text is on the left corner) Are dancers willing to marry? What kind of person is the ideal husband? Jin Meihong believes that it is best to marry after the dance ban, but choosing a partner is not easy. Most of the people who frequent dance halls are middle-aged now, and there are few young people. For middle-aged people, dancing is just a way to relieve stress and vent emotions. Can they discuss marriage with them? Cohabitation, being a concubine, is uncertain. Temporary material enjoyment will bring endless sorrows! Among the 15 directors of the Dancers' Association, five people hastily married due to concerns about the dance ban. They are all living in rented rooms, and no one dares to imagine when a miserable experience will befall them!</p>
<h3 id="e72">Most Are Unwilling to Be Concubines <a href="#e72" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c72" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">72</a></h3>
<p>Sun Zhimin said that most dancers are unwilling to be mistresses. Being someone's concubine, being pointed at and touched by the husband's relatives and friends, and being subjected to cold ridicule, they cannot stand this kind of anger. Miss Sun very frankly took herself as an example. She had also dated for several years, and many of her classmates, some of whom were unmarried, were quite willing to marry her, but a civil servant, bearing the burden of two people's lives, was already difficult, how could he support her entire family? And her old mother was suffering from lung disease, and her younger sister had to be raised. Where would the other party get the extra money? In this situation, how could she solve the marriage problem?</p>
<p>All the dancers present agreed that the general public in society discriminated against dancers. If they are not taken as mistresses, who would be willing to marry dancers! But they do not hope to live in a foreign-style house or ride in a car. They are satisfied as long as they can eat enough and their families can get a little warmth.</p>
<p>Meng Yan's ideal husband is: it doesn't matter if he is older, but he must not have a wife, and at the same time, he can give his younger siblings a chance to make a living.</p>
<p>Zheng believes that if someone with a wife wants to take her as a mistress, as long as the family recognizes her and treats her the same as the first wife, then it is not impossible to marry. She doesn't care about hard work, but if she is abused and ridiculed as a mistress, she would rather commit suicide!</p>
<h3 id="e73">Terrible Examples <a href="#e73" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c73" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">73</a></h3>
<p>They also said: since the anti-prostitution decree was issued, "husband" no longer has any "ideal" requirements; as long as he meets the basic needs, they are willing to lower their standards. However, they are still afraid of getting married. Then, they gave several real-life examples:</p>
<p>A certain dance hostess met a poor but ambitious young man. They fell in love at first sight, she devoted herself to him, and used all her savings to help him study. She also asked her dance patrons to help him find a job. Exhausted physically and mentally after nearly six or seven years, she lived entirely in anticipation. However, her expectations were eventually shattered. The young man forgot the great virtue of her nurturing and abandoned her after graduating. The young man and his family stated that marrying a woman who works as a dance hostess would ultimately be detrimental to their reputation, but he forgot that reputation was bestowed upon him by the lowly dance hostess. The shattered expectations caused the dance hostess to become extremely resentful. From then on, she decided to only love money and not people, engaging in superficial relationships and gambling with the world, enduring ridicule with tears. Recently, she has been living with a soldier in a playful cohabitation. Her only request is to continue her dance career. She said, "I still want to keep some regular customers in my hands, because I'm afraid he'll get tired of me and throw me away!"</p>
<p>Another dance hostess married a middle-class businessman. They could have lived a peaceful life as a normal couple, but unexpectedly, within ten days, they broke up. According to the man, he told people, "I had fun for more than a week, that's enough!"</p>
<p>In the vast sea of humanity, the experiences accumulated inside and outside the dance floor make them realize that marriage is a road they want to take but are afraid to go through. In Shanghai, more than 20% of girls start dancing at the age of fourteen. They have now been in the business for ten years, but they never talk about marriage. When asked about their feelings when the anti-dancing decree was issued last year, they said, "We really can't tell if it's panic or uncertainty..."</p>
<h3 id="e74">Many Hands Make Light Work - Hoping That All Sectors of Industry and Commerce Will Launch Group Scholarship Assistance <a href="#e74" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c74" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">74</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, we received a scholarship fund of 12.4 million yuan from Mrs. Liu Minhuai's birthday celebration, which made us think that in a big city like ours, countless people spend countless sums of money on weddings, funerals, and celebrations every day. If they could only save one-tenth or one-hundredth of what they spend, it would accumulate into a huge sum of money. Countless poor students are placing infinite hope on this excess money.</p>
<p>The "Reader Scholarship Fund" has been running for many days, and we have already received donations and encouraging letters and telegrams from several enthusiastic readers. However, we know that the power of individuals is ultimately limited. As the ancient saying goes, "One hand cannot clap, many hands make light work." If the major industrial and commercial organizations in this city could launch "collective scholarship assistance," I believe that the future of the "Reader Scholarship Fund" will definitely have unlimited hope.</p>
<h3 id="e75">Request to Unload Rice from Ships Causes Conflict on the Banks of the Suzhou Creek <a href="#e75" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c75" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">75</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday morning, two men, Chen Zhixiang and Chen Genxiang, who claimed to be members of the Seamen's Union, led over a hundred unemployed workers to the Northern Rice Market. They said they were representatives of the Xinzhapu Quan Cang Cooperative and requested to unload rice from ships on the Suzhou Creek. However, this type of work has always been the responsibility of the ship workers, assigned by the customers. If other work gangs were to be involved, it would effectively raise the price of rice, which is against the law. Therefore, the request was not approved. A conflict broke out on the banks of the Suzhou Creek. The police department dispatched police vehicles to suppress the situation. After Ji Mingzhai, the section chief of the Food Department of the Social Affairs Bureau, arrived at the scene to persuade them, the workers gradually dispersed in the afternoon.</p>
<h3 id="e76">Tea Dances and Dance Schools Prohibited First - The Social Affairs Bureau Sent a Document to the Police Bureau Yesterday, Likely to Be Implemented Today <a href="#e76" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c76" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">76</a></h3>
<p>[Reported by This Newspaper] After the anti-dancing decree reached this city, the following measures were stipulated to take effect immediately: No more dance hall licenses or dance hostess licenses will be issued. No more bar licenses similar to dance halls will be issued. Tea dances from 3:00 PM to 5:00 PM every day, except for Sundays, will not be allowed. All dance schools will be ordered to close immediately. The Social Affairs Bureau sent a document to the Police Bureau yesterday. If time permits, the Police Bureau will implement the measures starting today.</p>
<p>There are a total of twenty-nine officially registered dance halls in this city. At the end of this month, half of them will be selected by drawing lots to close by the end of March, and the remaining half will close by the end of September. Chen Su, the tenth section chief of the Social Affairs Bureau, told reporters yesterday that the bureau has decided that the Dance Hall Association will set the date for drawing lots. At that time, all members will be gathered for a public drawing of lots, and the Social Affairs Bureau will send personnel to supervise.</p>
<p>In addition, the implementation measures for the anti-dancing decree stipulate that "dancing is prohibited in all bars that currently have music, dance hostesses, or bar girls providing dance companionship for guests, and those who violate this rule will be closed down immediately." Regarding those with music and dance floor facilities, Director Wu stated that they will not be shut down for the time being, and customers are still allowed to dance with their own companions. However, due to concerns about potential abuses, they are currently studying whether it is illegal to bring dance hostesses to dance. In general, they will not interfere with compensated dancing; however, if it is for commercial purposes, it will be considered a violation. The detailed rules have not yet been finalized. Director Wu expressed strong support for the dance hostesses' preparation for a re-employment fund. He also stated that if there are any difficulties that require assistance, the government will not shirk its responsibility.</p>
<p>House Charity Raffle Ticket Prices Have Not Been Increased</p>
<p>According to the person in charge of the Winter Relief Association's house charity raffle department: Recently, there have been rumors that the prices of the A and B type house charity raffle tickets issued by the association will be increased due to rising prices. This is a complete misunderstanding. The association has no plans to increase the face value of the house charity raffle tickets. Currently, each A type ticket is still sold for 200,000 yuan, and each B type ticket is still sold for 100,000 yuan. Recently, sales have increased sharply since we entrusted major banks, newspapers, and companies to sell them on our behalf. The 1.2 million lottery tickets originally planned for this time will definitely be sold out by the end of February.</p>

<h3 id="e78">How Will 4,000 Dance Hostesses Survive? - A Serious Social Problem - This Newspaper Invited Eight Dance Halls and Twelve Dance Hostesses for a Collective Interview <a href="#e78" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c78" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">78</a></h3>
<p>Shanghai currently has more than 4,000 dance hostesses in dance halls of all sizes. Because the government's anti-dancing decree has officially arrived in Shanghai, a serious problem has arisen: "How will they survive in the future?" Although they shouted the slogan of "Self-help and Helping Others" at the general meeting, they are also actively preparing for re-employment. However, is re-employment an easy task? What follows is the question of how to re-employ? Where to re-employ? After re-employment, can their livelihood be solved? These are all things worth considering. As for opening schools and holding technical training classes, although they seem to be a way to solve the problem on the surface, raising funds and how to start classes will take a considerable amount of time. Moreover, the educational level of dance hostesses varies, and the selection of courses is quite difficult. Even if these difficulties are overcome and the dance hostesses can be trained and study, the training period should be at least a year and a half! Then, how will their lives be maintained during this long period? This series of difficulties are the pressing problems that dance hostesses think about day and night, and it is also the entire social problem. As for the general public's belief that the best re-employment for dance hostesses is to get married, how many people can afford the lives of a dance hostess's family? Are dance hostesses willing to be mistresses? These seemingly easy to solve but actually extremely difficult problems are what dance hostesses feel most fearful about. This newspaper, in order to address this rather serious social problem, specially invited twelve dance hostesses representing eight dance halls of all sizes to conduct a collective interview. From their mouths, we gained a deeper understanding that what lies before them is anxiety and hesitation.</p>
<p>In a short three-hour conversation, these ten dance hostesses from various dance halls did not give us the impression that people generally imagine. They are full of a sense of justice, analyze facts reasonably and forcefully, and their strong and powerful speeches all show that they have a good character at their core. Here we can see Jin Meihong showing the talent of a strong leader; Meng Yan with deep thoughts and a speech that can capture people's hearts; and Sun Zhimin, who is eloquent and good at speaking.</p>
<p>Summarizing their opinions: They believe that re-employment is difficult and marriage is not easy. In the end, they hope that the government can grant a grace period.</p>
<h3 id="e79">The Problem of Re-employment is Full of Difficulties - The Fact That Many College Students Are Unemployed Makes Them Even More Panic-stricken <a href="#e79" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c79" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">79</a></h3>
<p>Meng Yan was the most plainly dressed dance hostess among those who attended yesterday. She wore a blue cloth gown, old cotton shoes, no makeup, and was the most modest and careful when speaking. When describing her sad life, her voice trembled slightly, making people feel pity. She said that as long as she could survive, she would be willing to be a maid. She said, "I became a dance hostess because I had nothing to eat. My mother is old and cannot earn money, and my younger brother is still young and cannot work. Now I rely on earning money to support his studies. If dancing is banned, what will I use to support this family?" Summarizing her opinion on the re-employment of dance hostesses, she believes that some dance hostesses who have received education and have a junior high school education may still have the possibility of changing careers, but what about the majority of illiterate dance hostesses? Miss Meng said that she had not studied, and she had also considered her way out after dancing was banned - working in a factory. What she heard was only layoffs and closures, and it was not easy to get in. Even if she got a job, would it be enough to support the whole family? ... Besides working in a factory, there is also being a maid. She said that she is not unwilling to help people, but the difficulty lies in the fact that although her own life will be solved after helping people, how will her mother and young brother live? What's more, the market is so sluggish now, and everything is soaring in price. Even the big mansions are talking about thrift. After Miss Meng's conversation, her emotions became more intense, her face pale, and her feelings were tense. She said in a painful tone, "I hope to support myself with my own hands. Even if I can't get enough to eat, I'm willing to eat porridge, but you have to give us a way to go! During the enemy-puppet period, we still had a mouthful of household rice to eat. Now the government's ban is as firm as iron, where are we supposed to go?"</p>
<p>Most Have Not Received a Good Education</p>
<p>Jin Meihong believes that more than 70% of dance hostesses have not received a good education, and re-employment training should start with practical skills. However, raising training funds is not something that can be done overnight! What's more, you may not be able to get a job after the training is completed. There are so many unemployed college students!</p>
<p>She added: If a job has both college students and dance hostesses applying at the same time, I dare say that society's choice will definitely belong to college students. She pointed out that the social assessment of dance hostesses' lives as extravagant and absurd is a huge mistake. Although the social butterfly type dance hostesses are on equal footing with dignitaries and wealthy businessmen, they only account for a very small number. Currently, dance hostesses with a monthly income of 7 million yuan are already in the upper middle class, and those with 1 to 2 million yuan are very common. Just think that every dance hostess has family burdens and her own overhead expenses. The meager income is not higher than that of a store clerk. If there is now a store that pays its employees a monthly salary of 3 or 4 million, they would be willing to give up dancing and switch to another job immediately.</p>
<p>Most Are Over the Age of Thirty</p>
<p>They all agreed that there are many "old women" over the age of 30 among dance hostesses, who have been married and had children. However, some sacrificed and some were scattered during the Anti-Japanese War, and some have dying mothers and disabled fathers, so the burden of life cruelly weighed on their shoulders. Society thinks that dance hostesses are seductive and sexually suggestive, but this is just a painful means of earning a living. Some people also say that dance hostesses are despicable and lowly, but aren't there still jobs in Shanghai that are more lowly than dance hostesses? Why is the fate of dance hostesses more tragic than theirs?</p>

<p>There Are Three Practical Difficulties - Finally, They Analyzed That There Are Three Practical Difficulties in the Re-employment of Dance Hostesses: First, more than 10% of the older dance hostesses all have children, sleep late and wake up late, and have difficulty dealing with housework, making re-employment extremely difficult. Second, it is impossible for some dance hostesses who are self-indulgent and have deep-rooted bad habits to re-employ. Third, those who are willing to re-employ but lack skills and opportunities are equivalent to not being able to re-employ. Setting up schools to conduct training under these many difficulties is of course the most ideal, but the initial budget for school expenses requires 10 billion, which still depends on the help and guidance of all parties. Finally, they hope that the government will allocate school buildings for vocational training schools and extend the lottery time as much as possible.</p>
<p>Sun Zhimin said: She has been looking for a job for three months, but has not yet found one, and is quite pessimistic about re-employment. She is unwilling to be a "female employee with conditions" or a "vase with no potential." What's more, in the current sluggish market, it is not easy for those who have skills to find a job, so how can we lose to this big group of us? What she personally hopes for is that the government or social elites will set up a high-level company or other handicraft factories, because running other factories requires a lot of funds, and the dance hostesses also do not have enough skills (continued from the lower right corner)</p>

<h3 id="e81">Northern Fujian Highway Network <a href="#e81" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c81" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">81</a></h3>
<p>[Reported from Fuzhou by Airmail on the 8th] There are usually three routes from Zhejiang to Fujian: one is to take a boat from Hangzhou via Shanghai to Fuzhou, one is to go from Wenzhou to Pingyang. Take a small boat to Fuzhou, and the other is to take the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway train to Jiangshan and take a car across the Xianxia Ridge into Fujian. The reporter chose the third route this time.</p>
<p>From Jiangshan to Pucheng, from Pucheng to Jianyang, and from Jianyang to Nanping, these three days of 356 kilometers are enough to make people suffer. The car starts from Jiangshan, and the first hurdle is the Xianxia Mountain, the border area between Zhejiang and Fujian. Facing it is a mountain, and passing on both sides are also mountains. People who are used to living in the plains of Jiangsu and Zhejiang will be suspicious of being in a foreign land when they first enter here. The mountain roads are rugged, and the highways have to twist and turn. The highway cars have to advance along the line. The reporter personally saw the car bypass a large temple three times near Fengling, the intersection of the highways of the three provinces of Zhejiang, Jiangxi, and Fujian. The first time it passed the base of the temple, the second time it turned around the temple gate, and the third time it reached a road as high as the top of the temple. The twists and turns of the road can be seen from this.</p>
<p>South from Fengling</p>
<p>Passing through Pucheng to Jianyang, this area is traversed by the main peak of northern Fujian, the Wuyi Mountain Range, and is also the source of the Jianxi waterway on the Minjiang River. In addition to the folded mountain peaks, there are also rivers winding back and forth. When walking along the creek, you can see the mountains like walls. When walking on the top of the mountain, you can see the streams like belts. If it weren't for the bumps that made people uncomfortable, the mountain and water scenery would be quite enjoyable. From Jianyang to Jian'ou to Nanping, this section of the road is the famous production area of Jianben in the country and the raw material collection area for Fujian wood. The fir and pine trees on both sides are like mountains and seas. It's the beginning of autumn, the green leaves are still there, and the remaining shade covers the sky, which is a spectacle. After reaching Nanping, the three streams in northern Fujian converge, and the Minjiang River waterway is widened. Passengers to Fuzhou have to abandon their cars and take small motorboats here.</p>
<p>It is said that 15 years ago, this was still a barren path. After the "Fujian Incident" in the 22nd year of the Republic of China, the central government ordered the construction of a highway network to connect with the predecessor of the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway, the Hangzhou-Jiangshan Railway, for military needs. Except for the Jiangxi to Xiaocheng section, if Jianyang is the center, there are four main lines and six branch lines, which creates the so-called "Northern Fujian Highway Network." This</p>
<p>Four Main Lines</p>
<p>Are Distributed as Follows: From Jianyang, it goes east through Shuiji and north to Xiaocheng, a total of 118 kilometers, which can be extended to Jiangshan and connected to the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway. From Jianyang, it goes through Wuyi Palace, Chongan, and over the Fen Shuiguan, the border between Fujian and Jiangxi, to Shangrao, the terminal in Jiangxi, a total of 190 kilometers. It can also be connected to the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway currently. From Jianyang, it enters Guangze via Masha and Shaowu, a total of 112 kilometers. This road can be connected with the various highways in eastern Fujian. From Jianyang to Jian'ou, it enters Fuzhou via Gutian, a total of more than 200 kilometers. It enters Nanping and goes up the Minjiang River, extending to Shaowu and Jianning via Shunchang and Jiangle, with a total length of about 200 kilometers. In fact, the reach of this highway network has reached three provinces. There are railways in the north and the ocean in the south. It can truly be called a "network."</p>
<p>However, this road is full of difficulties. Since its construction, it has first been troubled by soldiers and bandits, and traffic has been interrupted from time to time. The actual traffic situation before the war was not impressive. It was not until the outbreak of the Anti-Japanese War, when the transportation between Fuzhou and foreign countries was blocked, and the provincial capital was withdrawn, that this road strengthened its importance. Especially after the 31st year, when the war shifted to the southeast and all the centers along the Zhejiang-Jiangxi line moved into Fujian and Jiangxi, this road became even more prosperous. At that time, the frequency of military vehicles traveling back and forth was the highest in the country, creating the highest record of automobile transportation volume, second only to the "Ledo Road" later. After the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, along with a period of chaos, this road gradually lost its function. There was a time when it was said that it was even interrupted for a short period of time. It was only recently, with the New Jiangxi Transportation Army and the transportation vehicles in the Jinrao area shifting their positions to make a living here, that this road was reactivated.</p>
<p>Currently, the Zhejiang Provincial Highway Bureau, the Highway Administration of the Ministry of Communications, and the Fujian Provincial Highway Bureau are all</p>
<p>Serving in Rotation on This Line</p>
<p>There are about 50 or 60 trucks and passenger cars traveling back and forth every day. Although the business situation is not very good, it is not bleak either. What is transported out are the local products of northern Fujian, such as bamboo shoots from Pucheng, paper from Shaowu, shiitake mushrooms from Jian'ou, lotus seeds from Jianyang, tea from Wuyi, and rice and miscellaneous grains from various places on the Minjiang River. What is transported back are textiles, daily necessities, and industrial products. This is a unique form of trade in rural China, and of course, this area is no exception. Today, based solely on the reporter's observations, I am very optimistic about the future prospects of this highway network. It can also be said that this optimistic stage has already begun, because with the rich products of northern Fujian, the railway, ocean, and river transportation lines that can reach each other, and the call of "developing the northwest of Fujian" that the Fujianese overseas Chinese have been loudly shouting in recent years, people will ultimately believe that northern Fujian has great potential.

<p>Economic Reform Plan: Draft Implementation Measures for the Transportation Sector</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 15th] The draft implementation measures for transportation in the economic reform plan have been formulated by the relevant authorities. The full text is recorded below: (Key points regarding water conservancy have been published in the second edition on the 12th of this month)</p>
<p>Original Plan: In addition to the planned lines stipulated and announced by the central government, railways may be permitted and encouraged to be operated by local and private sectors under the system set by the central government.</p>
<p>Implementation Measures:</p>
<p>A. Formulation and announcement of planned lines and regulations for state-owned, publicly-owned, and privately-owned systems</p>
<p>Railway planned lines are divided into trunk lines and branch lines. Trunk lines should be state-owned. The planned lines of more than 14,000 kilometers stipulated in the post-war railway five-year construction plan are all major trunk lines. The competent department will implement them step by step depending on the country's financial resources. Meanwhile, a revised and supplementary plan including other trunk lines and branch lines will be formulated, and local and private operations will be encouraged depending on the circumstances. Based on this principle, the competent department will review the existing relevant laws and regulations, such as the Public Railway Ordinance, the Private Railway Ordinance, and technical standards, and revise and submit them for approval and promulgation.</p>
<p>B. Strengthening railway engineering and transportation</p>
<p>Strengthening new construction and restoration projects: The new construction and restoration of various railways that are underway should be completed on schedule according to the established plan. In addition to the necessary equipment for military communication, the rest can be simplified to save financial resources.</p>
<p>Strengthening transportation: Continue to reorganize and enrich transportation equipment and vehicles to increase transportation capacity. Strengthen intermodal transportation to improve transportation efficiency. Pay attention to maintenance to ensure safe military operations and enrich road administration.</p>
<p>Original Plan: In addition to national highways stipulated, announced, and constructed by the central government, the rest are permitted and encouraged to be operated by local and private sectors under the standards set by the central government.</p>
<p>Implementation Measures:</p>
<p>A. Construction and transportation of highways</p>
<p>The national highway network of more than 57,000 kilometers nationwide has been formally announced and stipulated by the Executive Yuan, and the central government will take over in stages. Provincial, municipal, and county roads should first be planned by local governments and submitted to the central government for approval, constructed by local governments, and assisted by the central government. All highway transportation, except for those related to national defense and special needs, may be operated by local or private individuals as stipulated by the central government.</p>
<p>B. Improvement, maintenance, and engineering standards of highways</p>
<p>Strengthening engineering progress: National and provincial highways should be strengthened for reorganization and restoration, and road lines with too low standards should be raised.</p>
<p>Enriching maintenance: Popularize public road maintenance, and pilot mechanical road maintenance in border areas to increase road maintenance effectiveness.</p>
<p>Revising laws and regulations: The Highway Law has not yet been promulgated, and many existing highway laws and regulations need to be supplemented and revised. Technical standards also urgently need to be unified and should be revised, promulgated, and implemented separately.</p>
<p>Original Plan: Airports are operated by the government, and after preparations are complete for airway construction, station equipment, and flight control, efforts should be made to encourage private operation of air transport businesses.</p>
<p>Implementation Measures:</p>
<p>Strengthening equipment, preparing for opening up to private operation</p>
<p>Before the foundation of the aviation industry is stable, the first priority should be to enrich equipment, improve facilities, and ensure aviation safety. The construction of airways, station equipment, and personnel training need to be strengthened urgently. The following matters to be handled are listed as follows</p>
<p>A. Enriching airway construction</p>
<p>Quickly build two major air routes, north-south (Beiping, Tianjin, Jinan, Qingdao, Haizhou, Shanghai, Fujian, Xiamen, Guangzhou) and east-west (Shanghai, Nanjing, Hankou, Yixing, Chengdu, Kunming), and set up various necessary navigation aids along the line, such as radio navigation stations, radio beacons, obstacle lights, and meteorological stations, to ensure safety.</p>
<p>B. Strengthening flight control: Divide the country into eight flight control areas: Tianjin, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Hankou, Chongqing, Kunming, Xi'an, and Shenyang. Set up air traffic control stations, draw various aeronautical charts, and revise various relevant control regulations to strengthen control.</p>
<p>C. Enriching station equipment</p>
<p>In international airports and domestic air transport center stations, in addition to repairing runways and airports, night navigation equipment will be gradually added.</p>
<p>D. Strengthening equipment for repairing aviation equipment</p>
<p>In order to make the most of existing aircraft and equipment and maintain flight safety, the repair equipment of the two major airlines should be strengthened so that repairs can be carried out at any time at all important stations.</p>
<p>E. Training talents</p>
<p>There is a severe shortage of air and ground aviation technical personnel. In order to expand state-owned operations and prepare for opening up to private operations, the Civil Aviation Administration, aviation technical personnel training institute, and various universities should add or expand aviation technical classes to strengthen specialized training.</p>
<p>Original Plan: Trunk waterways are dredged by the central government, branch waterways are dredged by the province, and the smallest branch waterways are dredged by the county. Important ports are operated by the central government, and secondary ports are operated by the province and city. The central government subsidizes all waterways and ports operated by the province and city with financial and human resources. Efforts should be made to encourage private operation of the shipping industry.</p>
<p>Implementation Measures:</p>
<p>A. Operation of Ports</p>
<p>First, the important and secondary ports along the coast and inland rivers should be divided and designated, and a clear order should be announced. Important ports such as Yingkou, Huludao, Qinhuangdao, Tanggu New Port, Qingdao, Lianyungang, Shanghai, Xiamen, Guangzhou, Guangzhou Huangpu, and Nanjing, Yingkou, etc., are operated by the central government. The competent authorities should first carry out construction projects, as well as organize navigation signs, and build breakwaters, etc., complete the port construction plan, and enrich the port management institutions for systematic development. Secondary ports are operated by the province and city, and the central government provides economic and technical assistance. (To be continued tomorrow)</p>

<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 15th] The final revision of the primary school curriculum standards by the Ministry of Education has been completed by the competent department and is being sent to the Minister for review and will be announced soon. The characteristics of this revision include: In terms of new standard courses, the school's course selection should be based on the grade and season to compile detailed teaching material outlines and teaching material sources, teaching time, etc., and be flexible. Schools in the north, south, and central parts of the country, as well as in the border areas and overseas, can compile and adapt their own courses according to this standard. Also, in terms of time, it is permanent and can be implemented for ten to fifteen years without modification to avoid changes in typesetting and printing. Reduce the weekly teaching time for each school year to ease the burden on students. Merge the moral education standards separated in the 31st year with the hygiene training standards and restore civic training. Stipulate that the national language and common sense should still be compiled separately into textbooks and taught separately. In the first and second grades, only recognize characters without using textbooks. The teachers will compile teaching methods separately and teach in order. Stipulate that calculation structure will formally begin teaching from the third grade, and the first and second grades will be changed to incidental teaching. Restore arts and crafts, and merge the library science department established in the third curriculum standard into the fine arts department to expand the scope and focus on aesthetic cultivation. The music and physical education of the first and second grades will still be combined into singing and games, and manual labor and art will still be combined into work. Strive for uniformity in the standard format of each subject, and strive for the national language in all texts, and change the past style of mixing literary and vernacular Chinese. In short, this revision of the standard is much more progressive than before.</p>

<p>Since the Kowloon incident occurred, various universities in this city have successively issued declarations and lodged protests.

He said: The Japanese education of 51 years was to make Taiwanese compatriots forget Chinese words and characters and forget to be Chinese. However, after Taiwan's restoration, they began to be people of the Republic of China again. He thanked the students for lining up to welcome him, but he hoped that this would be the last time, because he had repeatedly ordered that such actions that wasted studies be prohibited and not to be copied. Then, the banner presentation ceremony was held. National Taiwan University and various specialized schools, national schools, and education groups all presented brocade banners, and the national schools praised him with the words "National Teacher and Protector."</p>
<p>[Our Taipei Dispatch, 15th] Zhu Jiahua told reporters: He is very concerned about Taiwan Province. When he was the Minister of Organization in the 29th year of the Republic of China, he was preparing the Taiwan Team and had a good understanding of the strong patriotic thoughts of Taiwanese compatriots. He personally inspected and understood Taiwan's education in detail, listened to local opinions, and discussed improvements. He hoped that students would study and research with peace of mind, not ask about external affairs, and not act rashly upon hearing news. More than 100 provincial or private universities and colleges have requested to be changed to national ones. It is already extremely difficult to maintain existing national institutions.

<h3 id="e100">Needy Students Should Not Solicit Donations to Help Themselves Avoid Losing Eligibility for Scholarship Applications: Mr. Pan Gongzhan's Written Statement Yesterday <a href="#e100" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c100" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">100</a></h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] Mr. Pan Gongzhan, Director of the Unified Scholarship Review Committee in this city, issued a written statement yesterday, saying: Education enthusiasts and national institutions from all walks of life in this city, in view of the past method of students soliciting donations to help themselves, not only wastes studies, but also is difficult to obtain practical benefits, have specially raised funds since this semester to jointly organize scholarships, so that needy students can be rescued without labor, and their intention is sincere. It has recently been heard that a small number of students in each school still plan to solicit donations to help themselves. The action is inconsistent with the purpose of the committee. Therefore, the committee has sent letters to the authorities of each school to persuade the students not to participate, and to strictly handle the preliminary review work, so as not to lose the opportunity to win awards. If the authorities of the uncooperative school fail to persuade them, the committee will immediately cancel their eligibility to apply for scholarships. In the autumn of the economic panic, all walks of life in the city are still actively raising scholarships to rescue needy students, which is a rare and commendable act of righteousness. All scholarship recipients should not regard this as a duty to them by all walks of life, and especially should not regard scholarships as a right that they deserve.</p>
<h3 id="e101">Dutch Overseas Chinese Leader Hopes That Nanjing International Radio Will Increase Reporting of Motherland News to Enhance the Effectiveness of Radio Education <a href="#e101" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c101" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">101</a></h3>
<p>[Our Special Correspondent, The Hague Dispatch, 7th] More than a dozen overseas Chinese in the Netherlands told our reporter today that they hope that Nanjing International Radio will increase the reporting of domestic news from the motherland and improve its power equipment so that overseas Chinese in Europe can listen to news from the motherland at any time. At present, there are about seven or eight hundred overseas Chinese residing in the Netherlands, except for a portion of sailors living on ships, most of the rest have household radios, but it is very difficult to receive shortwave broadcasts from the motherland. A certain overseas Chinese leader said that a few weeks ago, he occasionally received the international radio station's broadcast to Southeast Asia, and the current affairs report only had a few lines, and it was international news. The rest were all "Western music" records. They believe that since the international radio station is broadcasting to overseas Chinese, it should increase the current affairs report, especially the report of domestic news from the motherland, so as to increase the effectiveness of radio education. If it is necessary to broadcast music programs for relaxation, it is appropriate to broadcast Chinese music, or even Peking opera records, so that overseas Chinese will know that it is the radio station of the motherland as soon as they hear it. As for "Western music" and European and American international news, overseas Chinese can read the newspapers of the country of residence, so they can be exempted.</p>

<p>[Our Dispatch] The Municipal Bureau of Finance previously formulated measures for reducing or exempting municipal construction donations for various agencies, schools, and charitable organizations and submitted them to the municipal government for approval. It has recently been learned that the principals of private schools such as Datong High School, Daozhong Girls' High School, and Minguo High School have successively gone to the Finance Bureau and stated: According to the stipulated method, the municipal construction donations of each private school can be calculated at a low multiple of forty times, and the benefits obtained by each school are not many. They proposed a full exemption. The Finance Bureau submitted a report to the municipal government for review. It has now been resolved by the 108th Municipal Affairs Meeting that it should still be levied as prescribed. If an application for exemption is made, the exemption should be given in part or in whole depending on its operating performance and burden, as a subsidy from the municipal government to the school. The Bureau of Finance and the Bureau of Education will handle it jointly and it will be implemented starting in the winter of the 36th year.</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper Report] Since the leaders of the Shanghai Cotton Commercial Association discussed the future prospects of cotton merchants with Chairman Yuan of the Yarn Control Committee and achieved satisfactory results, they have followed Chairman Yuan's instructions and drafted a plan for merchants to operate on behalf of the committee in the future. The main points of the plan are: The name will be Shanghai Cotton Commercial Joint Operation Office. This office will be the point of contact for the Yarn Control Committee. The quantity of cotton to be purchased on behalf of the committee: It is estimated that more than one million market dan of cotton will be collected before the end of July this year. All members of the association can provide credit or physical guarantees to the office, based on their own purchasing capacity, and freely purchase raw cotton from various production areas. Once the plan is approved by Chairman Yuan, the joint operation office will be formally established, and a board of directors will be elected, and managers and staff will be hired. It is reported that after the establishment of the office, it is planned to ask the Yarn Control Committee to coordinate the operating funds for cotton merchants to purchase cotton.</p>
<h3 id="e114">Yarn Control Committee to Allocate Raw Cotton and Cotton Yarn to Small Yarn and Cloth Factories <a href="#e114" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c114" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">114</a></h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Report] Yarn factories with less than 3,000 spindles and cloth factories with less than 30 looms will not be subject to the system of spinning and weaving on behalf of the committee. Instead, the Yarn Control Committee will allocate raw cotton and cotton yarn based on the number of spindles and looms, and then purchase the finished products. It is also reported that the deadline for the Yarn Control Committee to handle matters related to yarn, cloth, and replication industry factories and businesses was originally yesterday. However, as the relevant associations were unable to compile the registration forms in time, a special request has been made for a three-day extension.</p>
<p>Cotton Yarn Continues to Fall</p>
<p>Yesterday, the cotton yarn market continued to decline due to tight credit among businesses and continued selling by traders. Demand from buyers was weak, and although replication manufacturers absorbed some of the supply, their appetite was limited. Supply exceeded demand, and the market continued to decline. However, arbitrage trading on the futures market was active, while other parties were less active.</p>
<p>In the end, 42-count Blue Phoenix fine yarn fell another one million compared to the previous day, to 60.3 million. 20-count converted yarn saw a sharp decline. In the afternoon, arbitrageurs entered the market to cover their positions, which was somewhat encouraging, but the final price was still about one million lower. Other counts of coarse and fine yarn also decreased by 300,000 to 1 million or more.</p>
<p>Cloth Prices Decline</p>
<p>The cotton cloth market opened with reports of profit-taking sales, and market sentiment was extremely weak. Tight credit conditions led to selling pressure from long positions, and strong players also competed to sell, strengthening the selling pressure in the market. Prices fell in a straight line. Near the close of the market, buyers from Ningbo and Shaoxing absorbed some of the yuan drill, partially offsetting the losses and slightly improving market sentiment. As a result, 12-pound Longtou fine cloth and other fine cloths continued to fall by 65,000 to 30,000, while colored cloth, domestic cloth, and bleached cloth remained stable. The rest all declined by 30,000 to 50,000.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper Report] The China Textile Construction Company sold cloth as usual yesterday, selling a total of 4,780 bolts of cloth and 30 bedsheets. There were 102 applicants, of which two were manufacturers who purchased 200 bolts of cloth. The rest were all purchased by cloth shops.</p>

<p>Government bonds initially fell yesterday but then rose, ultimately recovering. Unified C bonds opened at 67,000, falling from 62,000 before recovering to close around 70,000. Trading volume was approximately 4 million, with C bonds rising by 1,500 compared to the previous close. A, B, and D bonds were reported to be up 3,000 yuan, and E bonds were also up 2,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Among foreign stocks, only British American Tobacco (BAT) was strong mid-session, reaching a high price of 950,000, reportedly due to news of changes to the par value. Foreign companies bought in, and film companies sold off. Ewo Cotton opened at 620,000, retreating from 625,000 to close at 570,000. Compared to the previous close, Ewo Cotton, Yihua, Guangzhi Paper, Navigation, and Steel fell by 0.5%, while British American Tobacco, Jardine Matheson, and Ewo Drill slightly declined.</p>

<p>Yesterday, Chinese stocks were under pressure from tight credit and a poor environment. Many parties were unable to sustain their positions and sold off their positions, resulting in losses. Mr. Zheng forcefully raised the price within the market at No. 137, while secretly selling 200 million shares outside the market, leading to a rise followed by a fall.</p>
<p>At the beginning of the morning session, the rumors of dismantling over-the-counter trading lines were still prevalent, and the opening of industrial and commercial loans was also silent, leading to a low opening. Wing On Yarn opened at 800 yuan and climbed to 843 yuan, rising to 816 yuan and 860 yuan after opening. Backwardation increased, and over-the-counter interest rates also rose to 0.33 and 0.375, falling to 792 yuan and 839 yuan. Over-the-counter prices continued to be more than 30 yuan ahead of the market. There was a rebound to 810 yuan, and backwardation reached a new high of 862 yuan. However, due to a change in the surrounding environment, there were many downstream sellers, and credit was also unusually tight, retreating to a low of 775 yuan and 829 yuan. No. 157 significantly covered short positions, rebounding to close at 786 yuan and 840 yuan. Xinyi even fell to the limit, while Tongyi recovered after falling to the limit, along with Xinguang, Li'an, and Xinhua, all falling by 10%. Xinhuo, Rongfeng, Meiya, Commercial Press, Match, Jingfu, Qin Xing, and Banque Franco-Chinoise fell by 0.5%. China Industrial rose slightly, while the rest declined slightly. Backwardation stocks rose and fell differently due to backwardation relationships.</p>
<p>The after-hours night report contained news of Hong Kong electricity retracement and industrial loans, opening up to 810 yuan and 854 yuan. It then rose to 820 yuan and 859 yuan. Unexpectedly, while No. 137 was strongly advancing in the market, a large shareholder, Mr. Zheng, secretly sold 200 million shares outside the market. After Hengshu discovered this, the quote immediately lowered, leveling with the market, and the market price plummeted. Xinyi fell to the limit at No. 4, retreating to a low of 767 yuan and 805 yuan. The closing price was 769 yuan and 808 yuan. As a result, compared to the morning close, the forward contract stock Xinyi fell to the limit, Banque Franco-Chinoise and Meiya rose slightly, Xinguang, Neiyi, Huaxin, Li'an, and Xinhua were all flat, while the rest declined slightly. Backwardation stocks Xinguang and Jingfu fell by 0.5%, while the rest of the stocks rebounded slightly. Over-the-counter unlisted stocks saw banking stocks rise by 0.5%, Huashang fell by 0.5%, inland stocks rose by 0.5%, and the rest of the stocks saw slight gains and losses.</p>
<p>Due to the widespread tight credit conditions yesterday, it was difficult for dealers to cope. Backwardation gradually increased, and those who advanced at a premium could obtain a net profit of 0.19 to 0.3. This was not limited to those who advanced at a premium on the board. Yongsha opened at 40 yuan, rising from 39 yuan to 54 yuan. Xinhuo rose from 20 yuan to 28 yuan, Xinguang rose from 5.3 yuan to 7 yuan at the close, and Meiya was 70 yuan.</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper Report] The order announcing the implementation of the regulations on the settlement of pre-war deposits and loans in the banking industry was officially received by the Shanghai Copper Coin Trust Industry Association from the Ministry of Finance on the 13th. After the announcement of the regulations, the Shanghai Banking Association immediately entrusted the Banking Society to draft a Uniform Handling Method for the Settlement of Pre-War Deposits and Loans in the Banking Industry based on the regulations. After being reviewed by the three associations, it was submitted to the Ministry of Finance for record and notified to all member banks and companies to follow the method. At the same time, a letter was sent to the National Federation of Banking Associations to ask local counterparts to imitate the method to avoid discrepancies in operations. The method is divided into principles, methods, and examples. The three associations will comply with the regulations and begin settlement within one month. Therefore, it is expected that settlement can be handled from January 27th. Before January 27th, the associations will publish a separate public notice in the newspaper. It is also found that the uniform handling method has a total of ten articles. In addition to most of the content already published in the newspaper on the 14th, the remaining provisions are supplemented as follows:</p>
<p>Article 6: The calculation method for the settlement of loans is as follows:</p>
<p>1. If a portion of the principal of the loan has been repaid, but the interest has not been paid, the remaining amount due will be calculated based on the original loan date. The unpaid interest on the repaid portion will be calculated by combining the payment dates.</p>
<p>2. If additional loans or advances are made during the loan period, and the interest has not been paid, they will be calculated separately based on the respective loan dates or advance dates.</p>
<p>3. If the loan interest has been paid up to a certain period, the outstanding amount will be based on the interest accrual from the continued period.</p>
<p>4. If the lender has received funds on behalf of the borrower after the loan is made, it will be regarded as a repayment of the principal, and the remaining amount due will be calculated according to the provisions of paragraphs 1 and 3 of this article.</p>
<p>Article 7: For loans secured by the bank's deposit certificates or passbooks, after the bank offsets the loan according to the contract, the remaining amount will be calculated based on the interest stop date of the loan.</p>
<p>Article 8: The interest transferred into various deposits and loans due to bank interest accrual from August 14, 1937 to December 9, 1941 will not be considered as payment or receipt. Article 9: According to the provisions of Article 7 of the regulations, the way banks notify customers will be through public announcements in newspapers by local banking industry associations, and individual notices will no longer be issued.</p>
<p>Article 10: The sum of the principal and interest of the deposit calculated, all parts above 5 million yuan, shall be repaid in monthly installments according to the provisions of Article 7 of the settlement regulations. The interest shall be calculated from the date when the depositor comes to exchange for a new passbook and shall be calculated at half of the loan interest rate approved by the Central Bank at the end of the previous month. Before the exchange procedures are completed, or after the exchange, the date for taking money is overdue, and no interest will be calculated for those who do not take the money.</p>
<p>Explanation 1: According to Article 2 of the handling method, deposits and loans before August 13, 1937 shall be calculated by doubling according to the regulations in the attached table of the settlement regulations, that is, the sum of the principal and interest of each yuan is 3,405.924 yuan, which is derived from the formula 1+ (1703.462-7) x 2. According to Article 2 of the settlement regulations: "The principal part of pre-war deposits and loans shall be paid according to the currency amount stipulated in the original contract without any increase or decrease", in the sum of principal and interest of 1703.462 yuan, the principal of 1 yuan should be subtracted and then doubled.</p>
<p>Explanation 2: The trust funds mentioned in Article 3, paragraph 10 of the handling method refer to the funds entrusted by the entruster to be invested or used on their behalf. Ordinary trust deposits shall be settled by multiples according to Article 1 of the settlement regulations.</p>

<p>— Wang Juerong</p>
<p>I remember during the War of Resistance, one evening, a young woman introduced her brother to me for a medical consultation. Upon examination, I discovered that this young man had a severe sexually transmitted disease. I gave him an injection, prescribed some pills and a medicinal solution, explained how to use them, and offered him some moral advice. At that moment, he suddenly asked me:</p>
<p>"Doctor, is there any way you can make me better by tomorrow!"</p>
<p>"How could it be that fast?" I replied. "You'll need to come for several more consultations until you're completely cured!"</p>
<p>"But," he hurriedly said, "I have to return to Songjiang tomorrow because the day after tomorrow is my wedding day!"</p>
<p>"What?" I asked in surprise. "You're getting married the day after tomorrow? You absolutely cannot get married before your sexually transmitted disease is cured! You will transmit this terrible disease to your wife, and perhaps to your children. This is not child's play!"</p>
<p>"What can I do?" he said, very distressed. "Everything is prepared, the invitations have been sent, postponing is impossible!"</p>
<p>After an hour of explanation and earnest advice, he finally agreed to find a way to postpone the wedding. After he left, though I had lost an hour of my time, the inner satisfaction made me very happy!</p>
<p>The next day, he didn't come. I assumed he had gone back to postpone the wedding. The third day, and for a long time after, he never came again, and I gradually forgot about the matter.</p>
<p>Three or four months later, the young woman introduced a young wife to me for a consultation, and on the introduction card, she wrote: "This is my new sister-in-law. She's been married for less than four months. She came from Songjiang and asked me to recommend a doctor, so I'm introducing her to you..." I then remembered the young man from four months ago. After inquiring, I learned that the young man's wedding had not been postponed. I began to worry about whether this young wife had unfortunately been infected.</p>
<p>After various examinations, the Wassermann test and Kahn test were both positive, and the Zonbeck early pregnancy diagnosis reaction in her urine was also positive! Clearly, she had been infected with her husband's terrible disease and was pregnant. I began to worry about this innocent child!</p>
<p>My assistant in the clinic, having been involved in the work, knew the whole story in detail. After the young wife left, she began to curse the young man's misconduct, which had caused the young wife and child to be burdened with an indelible disease.</p>
<p>Of course, I deeply regretted that the young man had not heeded my advice and had reaped such a bitter fruit. However, I didn't entirely agree with my assistant's placing all the blame on the young man. I believed that the health administrative authorities should bear considerable responsibility.</p>
<p>Why? Because in China, a "compulsory pre-marital health examination system" has not been established to this day. Because of this, countless innocent young wives are infected with sexually transmitted diseases soon after their marriage! Of course, more babies are aborted due to infection, and those who are fortunate enough to be born are also infected with terrible diseases because of their fathers!</p>
<p>In advanced countries around the world, a compulsory pre-marital health examination system has been in place for years. Not only has it made a great contribution to eugenics, but it has also had a greater effect on the health of the entire nation and the prevention of sexually transmitted diseases!</p>
<p>Why hasn't our country, which is ridiculed as the "Sick Man of East Asia," established this excellent system as soon as possible?</p>
<p>In March of this year, at the invitation of the Chinese YMCA, the author and brothers Huang Jiayin and Wu Yuantai held a "Systematic Lecture on Marriage Problems" in the hall of the association. The author repeatedly mentioned the importance of pre-marital health examinations and urged the highest health administrative authorities to pay attention! In September of the same year, at the invitation of the Shen Bao newspaper, the author publicly appealed to the public to pay attention to this issue in two special weekly broadcasts on various radio stations. On one occasion, when the author gave a public lecture at the "Happy Family Society," he also asked the ladies who are about to become "mothers-in-law" not to just find the "son-in-law more and more interesting the more the mother-in-law looks at him," only paying attention to the son-in-law's appearance, but not valuing health examinations. Later, at the invitation of a certain girls' school, I also asked the young ladies that instead of demanding "diamond rings or gray overcoats," it would be more worthwhile to request a health examination certificate of even greater value. Health is priceless, and children are symbols of family happiness! If you have diamond rings and overcoats but lose your health and adorable little angels, will you not regret it?</p>
<p>Recently, I heard that the municipal health bureau is paying attention to this issue, but the public is not only not interested in it, but a few newspapers have published manuscripts ridiculing this new movement. I am therefore using my pen to write this manuscript to explain this movement, hoping to attract the attention of the public. The future of national health depends on the promotion of this movement! I also ask the health authorities to pay attention to broad publicity, and to submit the plan to the Ministry of Health, and then to the Executive Yuan for referral to the Legislative Yuan, to complete the legislative process, so that it can be enforced simultaneously throughout the country.</p>
<h3 id="e126">Defense Against Pulmonary Tuberculosis (II) <a href="#e126" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c126" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">126</a></h3>
<p>— Yu Zhengxing</p>
<p>1.  Relationship with Constitution: Before the discovery of the tuberculosis bacillus, the infectiousness of tuberculosis was not fully substantiated, so personal factors were given considerable importance. Today, it has been completely clarified that it is purely an infectious disease, and the relationship with constitution is no longer important. However, tuberculosis easily becomes a family disease, and there are other reasons besides infection and immunity. Therefore, today, constitution refers to the combination of physical condition (including asthenic constitution and scrofulous constitution), congenital placental infection, and other inducing factors.</p>
<p>2.  Relationship with Environment: The influence of the environment on those who suffer from pulmonary tuberculosis is very great. Overwork, malnutrition, or mental and psychological unhappiness, and constant depression, all make it easy to contract pulmonary tuberculosis.</p>
<p>The Incidence of Pulmonary Tuberculosis and the Economy: In Europe, pulmonary tuberculosis is called "the disease of the poor." Poor people work hard all day long, live in hardship, and are limited by their economic ability, resulting in malnutrition, thus increasing the factors of infection with pulmonary tuberculosis. According to Hamburg statistics: among those with an annual income of 900-1200 marks, 90 people die out of 10,000. Among those with an annual income of 10,000-0000 marks, 7.4 people die per 10,000. It can be seen that the incidence rate is inversely proportional to economic status. Because after infection, they cannot afford medical treatment, the mortality rate naturally increases accordingly.</p>
<p>The Incidence of Pulmonary Tuberculosis and Occupation: Infection varies depending on the occupation. Among all occupations, those that produce dust (such as stonemasons, 90%; metalworkers, 73.7%; and miners, etc.) and those who have frequent opportunities to come into contact with patients (such as hotel waiters, barbers, and bathhouse workers) are most likely to contract pulmonary tuberculosis. The second most susceptible are those who work indoors at desks (such as clerks, typists, telegraphers, seamstresses, shoemakers, etc.). Because they exercise less and do not get enough sunlight, resulting in weak physical resistance, they are also prone to the disease. As for manual laborers (such as workers, porters, and farmers, etc.), if the heavy exercise is not prolonged or very rapid, and there is sufficient sunlight, and if the nutrition is good, their incidence rate is lower.</p>
<h3 id="e127">Do You Believe in Zombies? Do You Believe in Ghosts? <a href="#e127" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c127" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">127</a></h3>
<p>— Qiao Xia Ke</p>
<p>Scientific medical knowledge and scientific hygiene knowledge don't mean just rattling off some new terms—or perhaps semi-old or already old terms—like vitamins, hormones, etc., until you can say them fluently. If "being able to say them" counted, then wouldn't those Donghong gentlemen who wrote stereotyped essays also claim to be speaking for the sages, "establishing words"? But in the end, it's still just a stereotyped essay. Those who can say "vitamins" and "hormones," if they "stop at just being able to say them," could very well turn into vitamin clichés and hormone clichés, which are what we call "foreign clichés." Who would want to degenerate to the status of a cliché? How can we avoid such degeneration? We must build a foundation on belief that can prevent corruption, and this foundation can be called the realm of freedom of belief.</p>
<p>I'm not talking about vitamins, I'm not talking about hormones, but I'm talking about—even now, there are so many people who are so happy to talk about, and so many people who are so happy to listen to—ghosts and zombies. Of course, this column is not a *Strange Tales from a Chinese Studio*; we certainly can't talk about them in the style of *Strange Tales*. And it's not Hu Shi's or Chen Duxiu's collected works either; there's no need to quote what they said, what they said about the existence or non-existence of ghosts; although what they said about the existence or non-existence of ghosts is still very worthwhile to read now.</p>
<p>Do you believe in ghosts? No matter how you answer, whether affirmative, negative, affirmative but uncertain, negative but uncertain, or uncertain whether to affirm or deny, good, it's always your freedom, freedom of belief. This freedom is permissible; we might as well call it freedom within the scope. Why is it permissible? Because those who believe in ghosts cannot prove their existence, and those who don't believe in ghosts cannot prove their non-existence, so we can only let everyone do as they please, and there's no way to force them. As for the records of ghosts in novels and the ghost legends of the elders, no matter how vivid and lifelike they are, if they cannot be performed on the spot at an appointed time, they cannot stand on scientific grounds. Ghost photos and ghost tricks, the "scientific ghost performances" of famous people at home and abroad, are still just jokes (or, to be polite, still just questions).</p>
<p>Do you believe in zombies, ladies and gentlemen? Here, freedom of belief is not allowed; there is only one answer: zombies cannot exist! Of course, the definition of a zombie must be stated: after a person dies, is put in a coffin, and after a certain number of years, the corpse will jump out (everyone says in unison that zombies can only jump, not walk), chasing people, grabbing people, hurting people, and eating people. —Have you ever seen a dead mosquito or dead fly turn into a zombie mosquito or zombie fly, jumping and hopping? If an insect expert could create mosquito zombies or fly zombies, that would be equivalent to bringing the dead back to life. Ladies and gentlemen, here, "dead" means truly dead, because the revival of a false death is not surprising. Ladies and gentlemen, I suppose turning into a zombie is revival, which is completely correct. Because a zombie can jump, and jumping is exercise physiology, which at least proves that the muscle cells are alive. However, turning a dead, truly dead cell back to life is currently impossible—if it were possible, how happy we would be! Bringing the dead back to life, bringing back to life those who have been dead, truly dead, and dead for a long time, is currently an impossible thing, a thing that remains unsuccessful despite strenuous research. Therefore, one cannot believe in zombies, one cannot believe in the stories of Chenzhou talismans driving corpses back to their hometowns. If you insist on believing, although it is your freedom, it should be called freedom outside the scope, which is not allowed on scientific grounds. Why is it not allowed? Because those who believe cannot prove their existence, and those who do not believe have already proven their non-existence.</p>
<p>Under the same name of superstition, there is freedom to believe in ghosts but no freedom to believe in zombies. Under the same name of science, can you casually believe or not believe? Can you have freedom of belief that does not abide by the scope?</p>
<h3 id="e128">Symptoms of Vitamin B2 Deficiency <a href="#e128" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c128" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">128</a></h3>
<p>— Liang Junqing</p>
<p>We internists or pediatricians often encounter parents bringing their children to seek medical treatment for symptoms such as a sallow and emaciated complexion, sores at the corners of the mouth, and stunted growth. Of course, this is a symptom, not a disease, because many diseases have similar symptoms, and we cannot casually say that they are suffering from a certain disease. However, experience tells us that if we treat it as chronic tuberculosis, that is wrong. If we say that it is pernicious anemia, that is also wrong. If we say that it is just an ordinary chronic stomatitis, accompanied by chronic anemia, or that they are suffering from intestinal parasitic diseases (such as roundworms), and that as long as we cure the local stomatitis, or cure the chronic anemia, or cure the intestinal parasites, these symptoms will disappear, that is also wrong. Because according to this method of treatment, these symptoms will never disappear. Why? Because they are suffering from vitamin B2 deficiency. If they are not given sufficient vitamin B2, then these symptoms will never disappear. Many parents are sighing over their money, thinking that having money is useless. They buy many tonics for their children to eat, but they never see any effect. Instead, they see their children always having a sallow and emaciated complexion all day long. "This is really frustrating!" In fact, if the medicine is not right for the disease, then no matter how much money you have, it is useless. No matter how many tonics you give them to eat, it is a waste of effort. The vitamin B2 deficiency that I am talking about now is one of them. As long as we can recognize these symptoms and give them treatment and prevention at any time, then children will not get these symptoms. By analogy, do we not need our recognition and prevention at any time for other diseases?</p>
<p>Speaking of vitamin B2, it is a relatively new thing. Although some people had published papers before the War of Resistance, saying that another yellow substance could be separated from vitamin B and that it was an indispensable substance for promoting the growth of young children, not many people knew about it. Since the outbreak of World War II, general medical experts have been working hard on research. They are working for the welfare of mankind. In addition to countless other medical inventions, there have been many great inventions in vitamin research. We don't need to talk about anything else; just take vitamin B2 as an example, there have been more successful studies. Due to space constraints and for the sake of being accessible, we can only briefly introduce it below:</p>
<p>Vitamin B2 (i.e., Lactoflavin) is a water-soluble substance. It is a necessary matrix for promoting the growth of young children. If they lack it, then the development of children will be hindered. It is a yellow, shiny substance. It can be extracted from milk. It is also found in oranges, eggs, and yeast. If young children lack it in nutrition but it is not very severe, then it can cause gastroenteritis, anemia, stomatitis, glossitis, cheilitis, and various skin diseases.</p>
<p>According to a report by Dutch physician Van Creveld, "When the Japanese invaders invaded the Dutch East Indies, many Dutch women and children were arrested and imprisoned in concentration camps for three or four years. Initially, the food was barely enough to cope with, but it gradually decreased. If calculated by heat energy, it decreased from about 2,000 calories (Ca 2000 kalorien) to about 1,000 calories. And the most uncomfortable thing was the reduction in meat. Later, in the late stages of the war, they could only fill their stomachs with beans or other grains. If they wanted to find meat, they could only catch frogs and snakes. Subsequently, the Japanese invaders were defeated and surrendered. This group of innocent victims, crowded together, and then suffered from a severe outbreak of measles, resulted in these children and young children all being pale, abnormally anemic, not only having extremely poor nutrition, but also having sores on their lips, inflammation of their tongues, and granular skin diseases all over their bodies (see Figure 3). Although other medicines were used to improve their general nutritional condition, they only recovered their health after taking large amounts of vitamin B2."</p>
<p>Based on the above situation, we can know the severity of vitamin B2 deficiency. And children who generally eat only one or two kinds of food are even more likely to suffer from this disease.</p>

<h3 id="e129">Sugar Without Sweetness <a href="#e129" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c129" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">129</a></h3>
<p>— Tizhai</p>
<p>Everyone was chatting and suddenly talked about the origin of many things, such as the scholar's four treasures commonly used by us "pen-wielding gentlemen," and occasionally they also talked about printing. The Han Juyan brush was discovered in Ningxia. Its shape is almost like today's steel pen. It consists of four long pieces of wood tied together to form a pen shaft, with the brush head clamped in the middle, generally made of rabbit hair or deer hair. Once it is worn out, it is discarded and reassembled. Thus, we understand the story of Wang Xizhi's great-grandson who wore out his brushes and formed a mound. Paper, of course, came later. The eunuch Cai Lun made it from rags and fishing nets, but it was still rarely used at that time. There are so many Western Han wooden slips, narrow and long, which shows that paper was not yet widely used. This led me to think about why the Han Li script tends to be flat and has such a hook at the end, the so-called "silkworm head and wild goose tail." It is probably because the space on the bamboo slips was limited, so it was necessary to use a shoulder-like body to accommodate more characters, and the formation of the tail hook was also closely related to the brush and ink. The reason is very simple; there is no need to say anything cloudy and foggy to deceive later generations and leave them in confusion.</p>
<p>But no one in China writes this kind of book that is both popular and not low-level. When talking about calligraphy, it is always the "Diagram of Brush Techniques," or something like the "Eight Principles of the Character Yong," which leaves you confused. The same is true for everything else. Bernhard Karlgren's Chinese phonetic dictionary immediately uses international phonetics to mark the ancient sounds of Chinese characters, simply and neatly, unlike Chinese scholars who specialize in "oral and auditory learning," from Chen Di, Gu Yanwu, Kong Guangsen, Duan Yucai to Zhang Taiyan and Huang Kan, who only play with the tricks of yin-yang opposition, clear and turbid sounds, causing many university graduates to still regard them as "heavenly books." In the final analysis, they still have to rely on Karlgren's method of marking out the sounds to give later generations a concrete concept. If there are still people in the classroom talking about the four-class sounds of "first-class Hongda, second-class next, third and fourth are all thin, and fourth is especially thin," that is simply confusing. However, what is shameful is that this clear and concrete method was led by foreigners, while writing is our treasure of three thousand years! Does it not make one feel chilled to think about it!</p>
<p>We often feel that Chinese so-called scholars are dedicated to keeping learning inside the door, absolutely not allowing it to "descend to the common people." Even if they put in a lot of effort to understand a small problem, they must make it mysterious and hide it away, saying it in such a magical and unpredictable way that people do not know its underlying meaning. In this way, after half a year or a year, they publish a highly sophisticated and confusing academic paper, creating more labyrinths and more intellectual puzzles. The scholar's status becomes higher, and we become even more unfathomable to them. Unfathomable is almost synonymous with "highly sophisticated" because you do not understand their "treasure of difficult words and shallow knowledge," so you must ask them for advice—if you are determined to get to the bottom of it—then the scholar's airs are put on at this time!</p>
<p>It cannot be said that we have few research institutions, and the money spent amounts to several billions, but what do they show? The common people do not know what these things have to do with them, even though those billions are directly and indirectly drawn from their blood. However, our scholars absolutely do not feel ashamed of this. The writing must be high, the books must be classical, the further away from the real world, the more Nirvana is achieved.</p>
<p>Looking at so many popular science booklets written by foreign scientific experts, I really admire them. Those who study history can write interesting and accurate stories for you, and those who study physics can write down the great principles of the atomic bomb that everyone can easily understand. They are willing to turn what they have digested into vitamins ABCD and then feed them to the ignorant people of the world, instead of eating big fish and big meat and specializing in setting up mazes.</p>
<p>Ilin's "One Hundred Thousand Whys," "Black and White," "Fire Stories," "Indoor Travel," etc., which country does not have a translation of them? The American Popular Science magazine has even better sales. Although we cannot reach that level, we should aspire to it. This is like making sugar, the essential condition is that it has a sweet taste. Sugar without sweetness is just waste. Western medicines all have sugar coatings to reduce our burden of bitterness. Apart from the fact that sugar itself is an important nutrient, this effect should not be underestimated. Our Chinese experts and scholars may be making sugar, but they have forgotten one thing—sweetness!</p>
<p>Who is willing to eat this stuff that tastes like chewing wax?</p>

<p>The American Fuyu Oil Company has researched a waterproof compound called Wax Emulsion, which is a boon for both clothing manufacturing and household use.</p>
<p>Putting a small amount of the compound into the wash water, and ironing the clothes after washing, has a waterproof effect and can prevent dust contamination, thereby reducing the number of washes.</p>
<p>This wax emulsion can make the appearance of the material appear more expensive and have a durable feel. Curtains or dresses, after being treated with wax emulsion, can maintain their original style and prolong the life of things like curtains. After each wash, the wax emulsion must be reapplied to regenerate the waterproof power.</p>
<p>The greatest use of this compound is that it can prevent the wrinkling of men's hard collars in the summer.</p>

<p>— Jing Wen</p>
<p>These past few days, when I open the newspaper, besides the floods that fill the pages and cause distress upon first glance, what makes one feel that there is still a trace of warmth in the world is the extremely enthusiastic winter relief donations. Many hands make light work, and many a little makes a mickle. From thousands to tens of thousands to hundreds of millions to billions and hundreds of billions, it can be seen that there are still many people who are willing to sympathize with the refugees struggling on the line of death.</p>
<p>However, relief is the most arduous task. Raising large sums of money is indeed troublesome, but how to use the money most appropriately, so that every yuan of legal tender is not wasted, is even more difficult. We must not only give the relief money to genuine refugees, but also strive for speed and seize the time. Winter relief means rescuing refugees from the severe cold to prevent them from dying. If fundraising is slow and distribution is delayed, like "a quick wind meeting a slow doctor," then "distant water cannot quench a fire nearby." It would be sitting idly by as the donations in the bank pile up without being touched, while the merciless cold current waits for no one! By the time spring returns to the earth and the weather turns warm, and the great waters of the West River can no longer save a carp in a dry rut, the large sum of money will have been collected, but the dead cannot be brought back to life, so what good will it do?</p>
<p>"Suffering" is the most abstract noun. No matter how it is explained with words or described with language, it can never be truly conveyed. Just take the two words "hunger and cold." Those who feast and wear sable caps and heavy furs need not be mentioned. Even those who have three coarse meals a day and a tattered cotton quilt or old coat will find it difficult to understand the pain of hunger and cold. Only by personally experiencing two days without food and shivering in the wind and snow in a single-layered jacket can one know that hunger and cold are by no means comparable to missing a bowl of breakfast or wearing one less vest. When the north wind tightens, hundreds of people can die in a single night!</p>
<p>If "death" is "dying in the right place," then one can be spiritually free of guilt. This is what believers generally mean by ascending to heaven and the world of ultimate bliss. Unfortunately, if one could live but cannot, then of course one will "die with eyes that will not close."</p>
<p>We must break the habit of moving at a snail's pace and take the suffering of others as our own. Relief is like fighting a fire, and delay is the most taboo! Otherwise, although I did not kill Bo Ren, Bo Ren died because of me. These refugees who have been pulled back from the gates of hell will still not escape the clutches of freezing and starvation. The refugees will die with eyes that will not close, and how can we be at peace?</p>
<p>Today's Zhongzheng East Road, before Japan launched the Pacific War, was known as Avenue Edward VII. Twenty years before that, it was a creek called the Yangjingbang by the people of Shanghai. The north side of the creek was the British Concession, and the south side was the French Concession. Inns lined both sides of the creek, such as Changfa Inn, Taian Inn, and Fozhao Building. These inns were all located around the Second Yangjing Bridge and the Third Yangjing Bridge. Guests arriving in Shanghai by boat from Suzhou, Hangzhou, and other places also disembarked at the bridges. I fear that young people under the age of thirty would not know about this.</p>
<h3 id="e132">Extraneous Poems of Weng Songchan <a href="#e132" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c132" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">132</a></h3>
<p>— Chen Yixian</p>
<p>Recently, at Brother Zhou Jinjue's place, I saw Wang Pengxin's copy of Zhao Mengfu's "Xiao Xiang Tu" long scroll, which contained a seven-character ancient poem by Weng Tonghe. It was written when he was returning to Beijing from visiting his ancestral graves in Changshu, passing through Shanghai, and waiting for a boat at an inn on the Third Yangjing Bridge. It is not included in his poetry collection, which makes it all the more precious.</p>
<p>The poem was written on the Double Ninth Festival of the Ji Chou year (1889), which was when Tonghe was most favored by the emperor. This can be seen from the line "I am now going to the palace, my mind soaring," and the small note "He entered to give thanks, and was instructed to be cautious about maritime matters." Ten years later, in the Ji Hai year (1899), he added a postscript to the poem, which was one year after Tonghe was dismissed from his official position and returned home after the Wuxu Reform. "Recalling the old events, it is like a dream," which shows his old-age sadness. (When Tonghe was dying, he had a five-character quatrain, "Sixty years of events, desolate until the coffin is closed. I will not shed tears lightly for you." His deceased friend Yuan Boyi praised it enthusiastically.) Now I will record his seven-character ancient poem and postscript on Wang's scroll:</p>
<p>"Writing on the Double Ninth at Yangjingtou,</p>
<p>I cook white fish myself and buy wine from the market.</p>
<p>Leaning against the bright window in a corner of the small building,</p>
<p>Peng Zhitong and Sheng Dalin are on my left and right (referring to two paintings by Wang Hui).</p>
<p>Who is knocking at the door, the guest from Tongjing?</p>
<p>He is alone in his sorrow, pitying my plight.</p>
<p>Pengxin sends me a scroll,</p>
<p>Xiao Xiang becomes a boat in my hand.</p>
<p>The north wind brews cold, the golden chrysanthemums are thin,</p>
<p>Bitter rain connects the beds, the kapok is rotten.</p>
<p>The faint waves are faint, difficult to grasp,</p>
<p>Where can the music of Jun Tian be found?</p>
<p>I thought of visiting Lord Dongting,</p>
<p>But unexpectedly, I meet the Governor of Yongzhou again.</p>
<p>Yongzhou resigned, and now lives in Ezhou,</p>
<p>Watching the stars in front of the Yellow Crane Tower.</p>
<p>Old feelings are vast, I only please myself,</p>
<p>The old brush is strict and not at all careless.</p>
<p>Dong Yuan's painting is originally a wonderful work,</p>
<p>Thousands of imitations, all kinds of ugliness.</p>
<p>Able to transform the plain into the majestic and profound,</p>
<p>Before there was Mi Fu, after there was Dong Yuan.</p>
<p>Yongzhou imitates the ancients without being rigid,</p>
<p>The brush forgets who is who.</p>
<p>The Lingyan Pavilion is open and the lots are drawn,</p>
<p>The Kuaiyu Hall is deep and the windows are startled.</p>
<p>At that time, all the old men praised and admired it,</p>
<p>Let alone leaving it for a hundred years.</p>
<p>I am now going to the palace, my mind soaring,</p>
<p>Still longing for Mount Heng, I turn my head back again and again.</p>
<p>Thousands of words shine, the emperor's grace is heavy (When Tonghe entered to give thanks, he was instructed to be cautious about maritime matters),</p>
<p>A rain is late, the will of heaven is generous.</p>
<p>Meijun flutters along with the jade scepter,</p>
<p>Tracing back to Yuan Lake and Mount Guiju.</p>
<p>The landscape and writing evoke past causes,</p>
<p>Intending to build a lifetime to serve good friends.</p>
<p>Tonight, writing poetry, I am ashamed of its roughness,</p>
<p>The paper is full of dragons and snakes intertwined.</p>
<p>The lamp flowers make flames, the sound of clogs is rare,</p>
<p>Will it be clear tomorrow?"</p>
<p>Postscript: "In the ninth month of the Ji Chou year, waiting for the wind in Shanghai, living alone and bored. At that time, Fang Bomin was about to travel to Hunan, and he held the scroll and asked for an inscription. I casually wrote a poem to ask for his guidance." Another postscript: "In the ninth autumn of the Ji Chou year, I met Fang Bomin in Shanghai. At that time, Bomin was recommended by Shao Zhongcheng to go to Hunan together, but I wanted to visit my sister-in-law in Hunan, and the fake trip was imminent, so I stopped again. Therefore, the meaning of the poem refers to this. Now it has been ten years. Bomin has already retired, and I am also living in seclusion at home. One day, he suddenly visited by boat and brought out this scroll to look at again. Recalling the old events, it is like a dream. End of the fourth month of the Ji Hai year, written by Weng Tonghe, the Layman of Songchan."</p>
<h3 id="e133">"Little Wild Ambitionist" Imprisoned <a href="#e133" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c133" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">133</a></h3>
<p>— Ke Ming</p>
<p>Casually opening the newspaper, the headline "Little Wild Ambitionist Imprisoned" immediately caught my eye. The content was: "Sixteen-year-old boy Jin Shishan, who used to study at Gezhi Middle School, suddenly last year claimed to be the commander of the Mobile Task Force, privately carved official seals, and privately issued orders..." etc.</p>
<p>Although Jin Baoshan is only a sixteen-year-old boy, his behavior violates the law and should, of course, be punished by law. Imprisonment is a good opportunity for him to reflect and make him realize his mistakes. However, the reasons for his crime need to be analyzed and studied. He himself said: "Because I have always had a desire to be a leader, and I have also been influenced by movies and comic strips," so he did these things. From these few words, we can fully see the morbid state of social education. For the sake of the next generation of citizens, this cannot be ignored.</p>
<p>Currently, what children welcome most, besides games, is comic strips. Teenagers have weak comprehension and are in a period of strong imagination. Legendary stories and strange and bizarre things best meet their needs. And comic strips are full of immortals who ride clouds and drive fog with boundless magic, heroes who fly over walls and move without a trace, demons who are twelve feet tall with eyes like copper bells, and ghosts who scatter beans to form soldiers and summon wind and rain! Therefore, children regard them as the only treasure for after-school entertainment. Despite strict prohibitions in schools, they secretly become even more fond of reading them. The current sales of comic books are so wide and the types are so numerous that they cannot be compared to any other books. Their footprints are all over every corner. No matter how remote the streets and alleys are, as long as there is a place with used book stalls, you can immediately see the red, green, and yellow comic strips, displayed in a dazzling array, attracting large groups of young customers. When children see them, they are so happy that they forget to eat and sleep, and they can't put them down. And illiterate parents even praise their children for studying hard!</p>
<p>As a result, toxins seep into the fragile minds of children and are gradually anesthetized. Over time, "news" such as going to Mount Emei in Sichuan to visit a teacher and Jin Baoshan-like events are staged. In schools, it is common to see elementary school students gesticulating and talking about monster stories, and sometimes when they are happy, they pretend to shout "Wala lala!" or organize armies and call themselves great generals. The reason for this is nothing more than wanting to imitate the freaks in comic strips.</p>
<p>The influence of comic strips is so great, can we no longer stand by and watch?</p>
<h3 id="e134">Truman's Consulting Physician <a href="#e134" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c134" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">134</a></h3>
<p>— Xu Tonghua</p>
<p>Serving as President Truman's consulting physician, his status and position are no less than those of the "imperial physician" or "Doctor of the Imperial Academy" in the era of autocracy. If the title "Medical Consultant to President Truman" is added to his name card, it will make the recipient of the name card feel awe.</p>
<p>Now, let's talk about the current consulting physician to President Truman, Brigadier General Wallace Graham of the Army. His rank is lower than that of Major General, but above that of Colonel. His responsibility is to take care of the health of President Truman and his family. Usually, this is a relatively leisurely job, with plenty of time to engage in research work in his spare time. However, before President Truman's mother passed away, he had to stay in Washington for a while and rush to Grandview for a while. The two places were thousands of miles apart, which kept him very busy.</p>
<p>Since the death of President Truman's mother, Dr. Graham only needs to pay attention to two patients, namely the President and his daughter, Miss Margaret. Both of them are very healthy. He only needs to take care of their moderate diet, sufficient sleep, and regular exercise.</p>
<p>Whenever the President travels abroad, Dr. Graham has to check the President's drinking water, vegetables, and various foods, so as not to let bacteria mix into the delicious food prepared. He found that President Truman is an obedient patient. He understands the way to maintain health. He must take a short break after each meal. As soon as he leaves the office, he can leave all matters, big and small, behind him. He can sleep soundly for eight hours at night, and he has a good appetite, although he doesn't eat much. He has no minor ailments.</p>
<p>Dr. Graham is six feet tall, with light brown hair and a slightly bald head. His eyes are blue, and he is thirty-five years old this year. He was a good athlete in his student days and also a scholar. He was born in Harrisonville, Kansas, and studied at the University of Missouri, Central Missouri State Teachers College, Cosgrove University Medical School, and Harvard University Medical School.</p>
<p>After Dr. Graham graduated, he interned in internal medicine and surgery at Kansas City Municipal Hospital, the Cooke Outpatient Hospital, and universities in Vienna, Budapest, and Edinburgh. He participated in medical work during World War II and served in the British theater. He was wounded in the front lines in a certain battle. His father, old Dr. Graham, is an old friend of Harry Truman.</p>
<h3 id="e135">Burma (Part Two) <a href="#e135" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c135" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">135</a></h3>
<p>— Ling Xiaohan Pavilion</p>
<p>In the midst of the celebrations for Burma's independence, it just so happened that a "Miss Burma," Ma Shengding (a female youth association worker), gave a speech in Beiping. It was very frank and very detailed, and there are many points that can be used as a reference for our people. It is especially wonderful to cross-reference it with a section from Carpenter's "Burma" in her travelogue of Asia. (Although Carpenter's work was published in 18197, many years ago, it still has reference value.)</p>
<p>She said, "Burmese women have a very high position in society. Eighty percent of men nationwide are educated, and forty percent of women are educated. Many women are principals, doctors, police officers, and even bricklayers. The status of men and women is very equal."</p>
<p>This is the actual situation, and it is not something that started today. Carpenter's book also believes that the characteristic of Burmese customs is that "Burmese women's rights are the best in all of Asia." It also says: Japanese women are slaves to their husbands, Chinese women are servants to their mothers-in-law, Korean women cannot go out without carriages, and Siamese women's labor is more burdensome than that of their brothers and they are also a property of the king. Malay women and Indian women and Turkish women are rarely seen on the streets. However, Burmese women, like men, travel freely and do not avoid suspicion. Women have equal property rights with their husbands, and women and men have equal standing in social interactions. There are many female bosses in stores, and female attendants at the counter. Although marriage is not autonomous, the joy of love is free, which is the same as in the New World. Although the law does not prohibit men from taking concubines, families are mostly monogamous, which shows the truth of love.</p>
<p>The above points may not be surprising if compared with the current situation in all of Asia, but at that time, it had not yet undergone the baptism of European and American winds and rains. All parts of Asia were feudal families. Only Burma, without the agitation of new trends, had women's rights on its own, which cannot but be considered a miracle and a characteristic.</p>
<p>Regarding the marriage section, according to "Miss Burma": "It is not very free. When a man takes a fancy to a woman, he must first tell his parents, and then the parents ask the woman's family. If the woman takes the initiative, it is a shame." This is somewhat like the old system in China. Just look at the "Dragon and Phoenix Wedding Invitation" of the old family. The man's parents first send a copy, writing "Respectfully request your golden consent," and the woman's parents reply with an invitation, "Respectfully obey your order," which are necessary words for engagement. Carpenter's travelogue also says that Burmese parents preside over marriages without soliciting the consent of the girls, so there are many elopements. Men and women like each other, become spouses, and establish families on their own, which is also common. Therefore, although Miss Ma Shengding said that Burmese marriage is not free, she also said that she had "been in love," which shows that it has been half "feudal" and half "democratic" for a long time.</p>
<p>On the day of the wedding, eating "rice from the same bowl" is regarded as proof that "they are now husband and wife," which is the same as China's "jiaobei" (intertwined cups). These "remaining styles and remnants" have probably been gradually eliminated or changed in the cultural import from modern civilization.</p>

<p>— Wang Baili</p>
<p>Hu Shigang Baocun wrote: "A person in my hometown once went to the market to buy wine, and always complained that it was weak. He asked the person in the store, 'Your wine has enough weight, but why is it weak? Do you mix water in it?' The person in the store said, 'No.' A countryman next to him said, 'You don't mix water in the wine, but you mix wine in the water.' Everyone laughed." These sentences seem quite similar at first glance, but upon careful thought, there is a world of difference between them. Qi Ji's early plum blossom poem says: "In the deep snow of the village ahead, several branches bloomed last night." Zheng Gu said: "Change the word 'several' to 'one,' and it is truly an early plum blossom." Xu then bowed down. This shows the difficulty of using words and sentences. In Han Yu's "Memorial to My Nephew Twelve," there are the sentences "Teach my son and your son, may they succeed; raise my daughter and your daughter, waiting for her to marry." The word "raise" is interpreted as "nourish." This "raise" character is exactly opposite the "teach" character in the previous sentence, and the sentence endings "may they succeed" and "waiting for her to marry" are also opposites. But today's people often misread it as "Teach my son and your son, may they grow up; my daughter and your daughter, waiting for her to marry." Although it can be barely understood in terms of explanation, the syntax of the second sentence is completely gone. This shows that not only is writing difficult, but reading is not easy either.</p>

<p>Chapter Six: Misfortunes Never Come Singly (43)</p>
<p>Zhu Zhai saw that this sentence had already struck his heart, so he sighed again and said, "I have no complaints now, I only complain that my fate is not good. I want to eradicate this bad luck, and I will fight with my life. Maybe happiness will come in the future. In the past, I was afraid of public opinion, afraid of everyone's gossip, but now I am not afraid of anything! Rather than bury the pain in my heart, I would rather let my will do something. Life is only a few decades long, no need to make myself suffer. My will has completely changed now. I can only plan for my own future, and I don't care about anything else. Let them laugh and scold, I don't care at all. In the past few months, I have suffered unspeakable pain, reaching the extreme! I can't bear it anymore." As Zhu Zhai said this, he seemed to feel something, his eyes reddened, and tears flowed down. Yun Qing had a cold face but a warm heart, and her heart was the softest. Knowing why Zhu Zhai was sad, she couldn't help but shed tears of sympathy, feeling a burst of sadness in her heart. She took out her handkerchief and wiped her eyes, saying, "Don't be sad. I think everything will succeed as long as you have the ambition. It is also reasonable for you to be dissatisfied with your wife. Your wife is not bad, but marrying you was a mistake. If she married a businessman, or someone who could be diligent and thrifty, or someone who was mean and calculative, she would definitely be a very good helper, able to help her husband start a business. Marrying you is absolutely incompatible." Zhu Zhai said, "I just can't describe her. No matter how she serves me, I always find her annoying, and I can't talk to her. In such a situation, not only am I in pain, but she is also in pain! I hate that her brain is too old and she doesn't have this concept of divorce. I wish I could ask someone who understands to explain the pros and cons to her, so she would know that divorce is actually beneficial to her." Yun Qing listened and remained silent. Zhu Zhai said, "It's not that I don't have the courage to openly propose a divorce, but because of my father's temper, you know. If things are not handled well and the old man is angered, then my sin will be unforgivable. I have always been tolerant and dared not act out because of this. But if I continue to tolerate it like this, my lifelong happiness will be over!" He kept sighing. Yun Qing said, "Your wife and I can still talk. If I go to persuade her, maybe I can move her. It's just that this matter is too important. On the one hand, it will ruin someone else's marriage, and on the other hand, I'm afraid people will gossip about me, which is very unfavorable to me." Seeing Yun Qing automatically express this intention, Zhu Zhai quickly turned into a smile and said, "If you are willing to speak, it is to save her, and it is also to save me. You love me very much, can't you sacrifice this little bit for me?" Yun Qing's face turned red and said, "What I'm worried about is that I'm afraid people will gossip about me. Everyone knows about our past."</p>
