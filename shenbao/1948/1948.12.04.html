<h3 id="c1">蚌宿間匪軍進退維谷　國軍越北淝河追擊　戰局已進入決定性階段 <a href="#c1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>〔本報蚌埠三日電〕據悉：此間徐州剿總二日有軍要會報，對當前戰局已作具體決議。另據軍方人士相吿，今後戰局之發展，以及能否收甚大戰果，端視南下兵團之淮展如何而決定。</p>
<p>〔本報蚌埠三日電〕軍事觀測家對日來蚌宿間戰局頗表迷惘，而發出下列疑問，卽：國軍刻除布有堅强之袋形陣地外，復正調集大軍，以增强此間戰塲之力量，匪於此時如自信有相當力量，自應從速以主動方式展開其目的攻擊，斷不致於主力南竄已近一週之時間中，迄仍徘徊瞻顧，如自揣無必勝因素，亦應及早引退，以脫離此河流交叉決不利於彼方之戰塲，而避免其整個被殘之惡運。軍方人士則認爲當前匪之躊躇躇不決，正足表示其已陷於進退維谷之兩難境地。</p>
<p>〔本報蚌埠三日電〕此間當面殘匪北移，於徘徊於宿縣附近匪之大部主力合流後，其第六縱隊尚在曹老集以北地區頑抗，企岡阻止國軍右翼兵團之進擊，今日在曹老集北十五華里之處有激烈戰事。又，左側之黃維兵團，今日自大營集東進續有進展。</p>
<p>〔本報蚌埠三日電〕今晚九時軍方公布：（一）在蚌埠正面一棧岡阻國軍進擊並掩護其主力退却之匪第六縱隊，已遭擊潰，（我沿津浦路北擊之李兵團，今日午前在曹老集。高老家以北地區擊潰該縱隊之一個團，復繼繼續前進）。（二）右翼劉兵團在空軍協助下，排除匪之頑抗，已攻克王莊，斃匪亦衆，並進抵九灣集仁和集一帶。（三）左翼某部在周家口殲滅匪一個營後面，刻已越過北　河追擊中。</p>
<p>「中央社南京三日電〕軍息；宿縣固鎭間大殲滬戰，現正　利發展。北起徐州，南迄　河，東至洪澤湖運河之綫，國軍强大兵團，自四面八方對龜縮於宿縣固鎭間之匪壓迫。至二日晚間</p>
<p>〔中央社蚌埠三日電〕宿蚌戰局國軍已臨勝利階段。北渡淝河之匪，昨晚續渡澮河北逃。北上國軍，今晨在强大機羣掩護下，已越新橋，進逼澮河南岸。南下國軍，則已迫近夾溝，預置宿縣靈璧間津浦兩側國軍，亦正奮其鐵拳，東西協力側擊。陷於此湖沼區域袋形陣地之陳劉匪部，刻見形勢不佳，正續向西北敗退，企圖避免全部被殲。</p>
<p>〔聯合社南京三日電〕華東戰區今日進入決定性階段，徐州國軍刻正向南淮攻騎跨津浦路之共軍三個縱隊，國軍向西南推進三十哩，卽可與第十二兵團會師。向東南推進六十哩，卽可到達澮河北岸國軍所守凸出陣地。進攻澮河綫共軍計有七個縱隊約十萬人，聞已轉移攻勢，僅留小部軍隊在原處進攻，其餘部隊全體移動，其中一縱隊開向西北。另六縱隊則向南推進，與徐州南下之國軍對壘，兩軍之會戰，將發生決定性之戰果。</p>
<p>〔本報鎭江三日電〕淮陰國軍已於一日主動撤守，官方稱係配合蚌埠會戰。</p>
<h3 id="c2">蚌埠形勢益穩定　淮河北四十里內無匪踪 <a href="#c2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>〔中央社蚌埠三日電〕以蚌埠爲中心，淮河北岸四十華里以內現無匪踪，蚌埠情勢益臻穩定，蚌埠浦口間之津浦客貨運，三日內可復常態。</p>
<p>〔中央社蚌埠三日電〕國軍攻克蚌埠以北曹老集及曹老集車站之役，共殲滅陳匪第六縱隊兩個團，及十三縱隊之一部。又，澮河南岸陳匪現尙遺有一個殘破不全之第六縱隊，担任後衛，作頑强阻抗，掩護其主力北退，北上國軍正逐村攻擊，一一予以摧毀。</p>
<p>〔中央社蚌埠三日電〕國軍於淝水以北地區已予匪以嚴重打擊，我劉·李兩兵團昨日全面出擊，陳匪殘部二·六·十三等縱隊約五萬人受創後，由何集·胡溝集一帶向西北潰退，是役斃匪共四千餘，鹵獲戰利品正淸算中。又，蚌埠正面津浦綫曹老集附近匪六縱隊一部主力，經我某兵團奮勇圍剿，斃匪三千餘，鹵獲機槍步槍等二百餘支，匪不支向固鎭以北地區潰逃，我先頭部隊已迫近固鎭。又據某軍事發言人今日以快慰語調吿記者，我南下兵團正兼程併進，形成南北夾擊形勢，日內當有捷音奉吿。</p>
<p>〔本報蚌埠二日電〕（遲到）軍方發表綜合情况如次：國軍左前翼黃維兵團，曾在北淝河東岸雙堆附近擊潰劉匪一·二·兩縱隊之一部，共三個國；竄至北淝河與　河地區間之陳毅部二·六·十一·十三等縱隊約五萬餘人，連日經李劉兩兵團配合京徐蚌各基地空軍予以痛擊，匪已呈不支，在蚌埠正北新橋周圍之匪，亦由陸空協力予匪重創，匪並開始後退，另有股匪一日曾渡過北淝河，圖擾左翼，牽制國軍兵力·經國軍出擊，業已粉碎其企圖。按自國軍在北淝河布成鐵網後，南下之邱·孫等兵團，復以鴕烏戰術在匪之背後加以監視，刻喘息澮淝兩水之間二十餘萬殘破之匪，已屆徬徨之境，可能不敢以主動方式對國軍作一主力決戰</p>

<p>〔中央社華盛頓二日電〕二日晚自官方探悉：蔣夫人下週初將訪晤杜魯門總統，杜魯門已對蔣夫人深致歡迎之意。蔣夫人並將在白宮對面立布勒爾里迎賓館（總統臨時宮邸）與杜魯門夫人會晤，國務院宣布，蔣夫人將於下週正式訪晤國務鄉馬歇爾。</p>
<p>〔美國新聞處華盛頓二日電〕杜魯門總統二日舉行自十一月大選後第一次之正式記者會，杜氏稱：蔣夫人已約定與渠會晤。總統在回答其他問題時并透露，不擬派遣麥克阿瑟赴華。某記者問：總統是否擬發表關於中國局勢之政策聲明。杜魯門稱：渠發表此種聲明已有三次，而今不再有所欲言。</p>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓三日電〕杜魯門總統過去之三次聲明爲：</p>
<p>（一）一九四五年十二月十五日，總統宣稱：「在中國走向和平與統一之時，美國當凖備以一切合理方式援助中國政府，如中國政府擴大基礎，則中國之和平統一與民主改革，卽可達成」。</p>
<p>（二）一九四六年十二月十八日，總統宣稱：「在中國走向和平及容智之民主政府時，吾人準備援華，但爲避免捲入中國內爭，吾人將堅持協助中國人民之政策，以建樹和平及經濟復與」。</p>
<p>（三）一九四八年二月十八日，總統宣稱：「中國局勢之發展，朱如吾人之希望，美國政府給予之援助，卽使係極小之數量，亦不能替代僅有中國政府本身能採取之必須行動」。</p>
<p>「合衆社華盛盛頓三日電〕蔣夫人二日庄馬歇爾夫人陪同，自浮吉尼亞至華盛頓，晚六時至華德之李特醫院探視正在檢査體格之馬卿，談約一小時。此次訪晤之時間長度，顯然指出非普通性之拜會。三日可能再度往訪。</p>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓二日電〕蔣未人已開始在此活動，日內將與杜魯門總統會晤，又聞蔣夫人將訪杜魯門夫人。美國國會監督援外計劃委員會主席史密斯稱：本會定於三日開會，理當恭聽蔣夫人報告，余深信本委員會將贊成聴取夫人之報吿，但亦同樣確信，本委員會無權呼籲對華緊急軍事援助。繼續以軍費或軍用品供給中國，應由總統，國務卿及軍事常局決定之。吾人所亟望者，爲援助中國復興。</p>

<p>〔合衆社東京三日電〕接近麥克阿瑟元帥人士三日稱：杜魯門總統旣已宣布不派麥帥赴華，麥帥開悉，以爲懸疑旣解，而頗感欣悅。某高級方面稱：麥帥戎馬一生，對中國之行，當然感到與趣，然渠以爲，職賣所在，仍應留居日本加以重建。麥帥雖未懷疑其本人有扭轉中國局勢之能力，惟若干下屬則認爲恐將勞而無功，故彼等恐曾勸阻麥帥之赴中國。日本方面對總統宣言之初步反響極佳，大多數日本人不願麥帥他去，然亦有多人認爲，麥卽如以治日本之成績赴華，解決困難，重建和平統一，亦是善策。又據悉：麥帥曾吿左右以改善中國局面之戰術方略。更悉：多時來，渠對中國局勢備寄關懷，三日華府另有一電訊引起其注意，厥爲蘇聯駐遠東委員會代表潘友新攻繫麥帥之佔領行政，接近麥帥人士稱：渠認潘氏之言乃「宣傳」，而不屑一顧，按盟總雖屢接新聞記者之申請，要求發表文吿，答覆潘氏，然迄未有一字宣布，某美官員稱：蘇聯此類聲明，對麥帥毫不起作用。</p>

<h3 id="c20">速定亞洲復興計劃 <a href="#c20" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e20" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">20</a></h3>
<p>聯合國亞洲及遠東區經濟委員會，日來正在漢洲的拉布斯東城開會，檢討亞洲經濟復輿的大計，引起選東有關各國人士的重視；尤其在亞洲危機日益深刻的今日，該會討論此一問題，格外覺得其意義異乎經常。</p>
<p>印度代表台賽氏於二日發表意見，他認爲亞洲如若沒有類似歐洲復興計劃的打算，則共產主義的勢力必將控制整個亞洲，所以他主張一百三十億美元的亞洲復興計劃，應由該會予以通過。同時他對於美國政府重歐輕亞的熊度，尤表不滿，他說：「最近美國聲明，亞洲應由私人資本去開發，這種主張實在是一種錯誤的看法，唯有目前在西歐實行的馬歇爾計劃，始能應付亞洲目前的急需，西方强國實不應一面叫東方各國整頓內部，而另一方面又不予以援助，使吾人力能爲此。若以爲西歐復興計劃已足以確保整個世界不受國際共產主義的威脅，則非誤卽謬。須知歐洲復興計劃，或能保全歐洲於一時，但若亞洲沒有類似的復興計劃，則共產主義終必獲得整個勝利」。我們看了台賽氏的演辭，句句是眞理，需語是良言，可謂實獲我心，但不知主張重歐輕亞的美國人士聴了作何感想。</p>
<p>放眼看今日的亞洲，我們固不欲危害　聴，說亞洲的危機是如何的嚴重；但放在我們眼前的事實却是鐵一般的，不問你願意不願意，終不能不承認，東南亞的一片動亂現象，顯示出各國感受共產勢力威脅的嚴重，朝鮮問題的陷於僵局及韓南發生叛變，更足以說明了東北亞也岌岌可危。再加以中國局勢的急轉直下，中共的流竄部隊幾已侵入政府的心臟，展望前途，亦大有待於吾人的努力。在這種危急的情勢之下，西方强國不欲維護世界和平則已，否則非先搶救亞洲不可。利害得失，一目了然。美國外交當局對於中國危局，迄今尙未作最後的決定，對於整個亞洲，猶言應由私人資本去開發，不欲採行亞洲復興計劃。這不論從那一個角度去觀察，終是美國外交的不智。長此坐誤牽延下去，勢必在亞洲造成歷史性的錯誤，而將追悔莫及。</p>
<p>誰者不能能中認，中國是亞洲唯一的安定力，她的一舉一動，均足以牽動全局。「欲征服亞洲，必先征服中國」，在昔日本軍閥如此想在今日的新侵略國家—蘇聯也作如是想。中共稱兵叛變，織六地　，　亟　取載權，就是懷驚這　爲共產國際作前驅的狠毒陰謀。中國朝野不惜「開誠求援」，並不是完全爲自己打算，實在也是爲了整個亞洲不受共產勢力的威骨。有人說獎國對於援助中國，不懂負有道義上的責任，而且也是利人利己的行爲，可謂最公平的正論。若美國自觀爲富翁，而視人爲「乞丐」，祗存着一種「布施』心理，甚至在中途洩氣，宋免害人害已！</p>
<p>總統日前在京向美國合衆社副社長房恩發表談話，對於亞洲爲歇爾計劃，也有嚴正的表示。中國一般人士並不希望美國援中國及亞洲各國而自吿破產，但均認爲美國在亞洲應實施馬歇爾訂劃。所以在遠東經濟委負會中，除了蘇聯而外，沒有一國的代表不是表示贊成。但硏究蘇聯反對亞洲馬歇爾計劃的動機，聰了蘇聯代表諾維柯夫的演說，也就可以「洞燭其奸」了。諾維柯夫說。「蘇聯反對以亞洲馬歇爾計劃來解決亞洲問題，爲的是亞洲馬歇爾計劃將使亞洲廣大地區也變爲英美帝國主義侵略野心的對象」。絃外之音，不言可知。亞洲各國均在開誠求援，而美國猶在徘徊瞻顱，使人對於美國外交政策眞要「莫名其妙」了。但願美國外交當局對於印度代表合張氏的演辭，再三思之。何去何從，速作明智的決定！</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕本市十一月份配米價格，經當局公佈爲每石三百十元後，各界以配價超越市價，均表驚訝。據探悉：本期配價議高，實係市府當局所建議。因吳市長前曾向記者談，市府對決定戶口米價時，必考慮二點：（一）鑒於限價時期各地發生搶米風潮之經驗，得知充儲存米，實爲治安之本。（二）米價與生活指數之關係，因米價高可能影響生活指數上漲，市府亦當注意。鑒於以上之第一點，市府決試行將配價提高，，則食米不致一搶而空，而米商見有利可圖，必至各地採購，則太市存米卽可充沛。如若配價過低，市民必往搶購，且如與產區形成倒掛現象，則食米必不來滬。故本期配價公佈後，吳市長曾稱：本市本月份食米來源必暢，決無米荒現象。</p>

<p>惟配價定高後，是否將影響生活指數上漲一點，市府亦曾者慮及此，爲此，當局決定　辦公敎人員及新聞記者重點配給制度。因生活指數計算方式中，米量單位爲八斗，重點配給制度實行後，其中四斗決以每石二百三十元計算，則生活指數可望不受影響。又據吳市長昨吿記者稱：渠預測本月份生活指數可吿平穩。因米價無波動，且各物均吿下跌，公用事業雖將調整，惟上漲成數不多。渠又稱：生活指數決不假造，十一月上半月指數八·一倍於十五日公佈後，十六日卽曾上漲至十八·二倍，後以物價下降，故至月底發表時，爲十五·四倍。並表示本月份指數恐將下跌。渠稱：工商界極端困難，生活指數實在不能再漲了。</p>

<h3 id="c75">潘議長由京近滬　對時局發表觀感　深願市民奮發　共起自衛救國　陸海配合作戰江南絕無問題 <a href="#c75" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e75" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">75</a></h3>
<p>潘議長公展，昨晨十時，由京回滬時，於車站晤見記者，當詢以此次進京任務及觀感。潘氏謂：余昨晨與方主委希孔爲空軍慰勞團事赴京，先事洽辦布置，乘便往訪司徒雷登大使，站在人民立塲，重申希望美國加速援華，阻退共產勢力在華之膨脹，並說明上海爲一大國際都市，英美商務利益，關係亦至深切，中外居民均有協助政府，維持地方秩序，安定社會之必要，大公使頗爲首肯，並透露外商決不隨便撤退之意。午後四時半，曾進謁總統，方主委及張主委道藩報吿赴徐州前綫慰勞經過，余並將上海各社團領袖最近發動自救救國工作，準備以人民力量擁護元首戡亂之籌備情形。有所報吿，深盼中樞當局格外鎭定堅決，號召全國人民，共起自衛救國，達到反共產反極權反侵略之目的。總統認爲上海各界人士深明大義，能以行動表示其愛國精神，殊可欣慰示並謂當再電約各社團領袖杜月笙，徐寄廎，錢新之，案潤卿，李馥蓀諸氏到京，聽取意見，以備採擇。</p>
<p>晚間八時，余與方主委赴空軍新生社舉行盛大之慰勞晚會，其時空軍將士到者已有千餘人，濟濟一堂，精神飽滿。方主委與余將全市五百萬同胞對飛將軍崇敬慰勞之誠意，先爲說明，候至十時，空軍慰勞團團員方乘火車到京，乃卽獻錦旗，開始舞會。余因上海有要事待理，故先乘夜車回滬，由種種跡象觀察，政府今後確有尊電民意，與民更始之決心。且蚌埠前綫固宿間之會戰，昨日傳來捷報，匪軍因遭受夾擊，已開始向北潰退，加以我有海空軍配合作戰，匪軍更難渡江，故江南治安絕無問題。首都一部份民眷，紛紛乘車來滬，車站稍形擁擠，客車亦因軍運頻繁而誤點，自屬戰時不免之現象。惟據余觀測，前綫將士以生命與共匪相拚，吾後方同胞若果眞願免於共匪之殘暴統治，祗有萬衆一心，出錢出力，擊潰匪軍，方爲澈底辦法，決非逃避所能濟事，上海爲「一二八」「八一三」兩次抗日戰爭之光榮都市，水道有海口可與國際往來，陸路有大軍在兩路沿綫及沿江各縣駐防，加以中央新置京滬警備總司令部統一指揮，祗須吾市民共同奮發，一面策動自衛訓練，維持地方秩序，一面慷慨輸將，加緊慰勞將士，救助傷患官兵及流離失所之難一胞，同時消除各階層之隔閡，協一調勞資關係，均以顧全大局爲前提，則自助人助，敢信不僅大江以南可以固若金湯，卽前綫士氣，亦必因後方安定而更形奮發，匪軍受異族之指使，奴役全國人民之陰謀，終將無以得逞也。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕時局動盪，本市各校一部份學生，紛紛請假離校。記者昨特分訪各大學負資人，茲將各校情形，分誌如下：</p>
<p>同濟</p>
<p>大學行政會議開會決定接受學生之請求，凡家在內地之自費生而經濟困難者，准予請假返至其本鄉附近之大學借讀，借讀學分合格者，將來可予承認，校方昨已正式佈吿週知。急須返鄕之同學昨日乃紛紛輟學外出，張羅路費。又該校糧食恐慌，存糧僅可維持至後日（六日）止。校方已請民調會協助，該會允予考慮。據敎務長夏堅白對記者談：同濟共有學生約三千人，其中半數爲自費生，自費生中一部係來自四川·湖南者，最近因本市物價上漲，家中匯款不濟，生活困難，乃於二週前請求校方准其歸返本鄉附近之大學借讀，如此家中接濟方便，學業仍可不輟。其餘在校學生遵敎部規定，仍照常上課。又同濟校長丁文淵因患狹心症，二度請辭，敎部尙未核准。</p>
<p>交通</p>
<p>大學學生社團及各系級，日前紛紛簽名，要求校方儲糧三個月以應急需。學生自治會於昨晚六時召開緊急系科代表大會，商討決定數點：（一）在任何情形下，決不遷校。號召同學不離校。（二）由校方敎授學生及工警分別推派代表，會同晋京，向敎部要求借支敎授，工警薪金三個月，及預發學生公費三個月。（三）請校方撙節開支，並設法向中央銀行借款儲糧。（四）同學集款購存糧食，並實行節電運動。（五）請校方在校內開瑚水井。（六）由校方敎授學生工警會同成立應變組織。據校畏主之卓與記者談：存糧三月事原則上可行，但敎部恐無如許款項撥下，現正在硏究中。校內有少數同學請假派鄕，校方決照常上課。</p>
<p>曁南</p>
<p>大學校長李壽雍表示：該校是否提早放假尚未決定，校中存糧短期內尙可勉强維持，但燃料困難，校方經費不能負担，學生已有一部份請假回鄕。</p>
<p>約翰</p>
<p>大學向學生家長籌募學校經費事，不如理佳之註。據悉校方可。能將本學期提前至本月底放假</p>
<p>滬江</p>
<p>大學校長凌憲塲聲稱：該校近日正在舉行小考，第二次學費泱定不增收，是否提早放假尙未正式考慮，當視時局而定。</p>
<p>東吳</p>
<p>大學校長楊永淸表示：該校學生固有請假返鄕者，但爲數不多，是否提前放假，尙未談到，糧食問題，正在逐步計劃中。</p>
<p>復旦</p>
<p>大學校長章益表示：校內現尙安定。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕財政部上海金融管理局稽核夏培德，前於七月中旬，奉派檢査本市其昌銀行上海分行放款大戶及同月十三日該行交換逾時之眞相，竟串通該行副理韋仲懷，僞造檢査報吿書，藉端勒索黃金四條朱遂，經金管局發覺並報財部將本案移送地檢處偵査，偵在期間，夏培德逃逸，末對韋仲懷以貪汚罪嫌，提起公訴。本案昨日下午三時在地院審理，傳到被吿韋仲懷及證人其昌經理李子靜。韋仲懷供稱：夏奉派於七月十五日到行査賬，十七日午由渠與該行專員劉明揚邀夏在新雅午餐，十九日晚夏邀渠至家晤談，夏謂：其禺賬務，頗有毛病，已經渠査出，惟尙未製成報吿，繼明白表示稱：公務員待遇低微，生活淸苦，希望以貴行一日所得黃金四條，作爲渠之生活補貼，渠未敢應，當於次晨將夏之要求，轉吿經理李子靜，率卽予回絕，渠遂於是晚覆夏婉拒，至二十三日晨，渠於上班時，接獲一信，內有匿名之勒索便條一紙及不利於其昌之檢査報吿書一份，渠遂持該報吿書，商諸李經理，李稱跡近勒索，擬向駐行董監報吿，是日下午渠因事回蘇州家中，至二十五日返滬，始悉李已向金管局報請澈査。庭上以渠旣已回拒夏之要求，爲何其後另致渠兩稱「小兒兩人尙在大學肄業，下學期各需米四石繳費，屆時仍請幫忙」？韋語塞不　答。證人李子靜稱：渠於韋將匿名人所寄之檢査報吿書送渠後，卽與駐行董監研究，認爲夏某有勒索婊疑，經向金管局報請澈査，並稱據渠觀察，被吿僅負轉達任務，不致與夏串通。庭上以尙有向金管局繼續調査之必要，號令改期再審，被吿交五萬金圓書面保。</p>

<p>最近半月來，本報接得讀者投書，對本市私立中小學校增收第二次學費一事，或對私校當局之「學店」作風表示憤慨，要求主管當局予以取締；或對中小學敎師生活之艱苦，深表同情，認爲應衡情酌理，迅謀解決。均經本報轉送敎育當局，俾供合理解決之參考。而日來讀者投書中，對一部分私校當局及敎師，以不願加重學生家長之負祖，而願意茹苦如飴，不增收第二次學費，頗爲感動；提議發起捐募尊師金運動，以實際行動，表示其同情與崇敬之意。本報素以「助學」爲重要服務工作之一種，如尊師金之勸募，可使敎師安心敎學，可使學生課業不受影響，故對讀者之要求，自是傑願效勞；茲自卽日起，由本報社會服務科代收尊師金。並祈求各界熱心敎育人七，慷慨解囊，踴躍贊助！</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕存款兌現業務，迄目前爲止，仍僅限於中中交農四總行辦理。是以擁擠情形，日甚一日。惟據中央銀行業務局負責人昨語記者，國行早已通知中國·交通·中國農民三行，速飭本市所屬分支機構同時辦理兌現業務，惟以各行準傳手續，頗爲繁瑣，致不無延冗。茲經積極準備後，至下週一起，中交農所屬本市分支機構，大致同時開始辦理兌現業務，則目前擁擠情形，當可改善。又外傳徐財長此次來滬，曾召集國行業務局負責人商談改進兌現辦法，渠亦切實否認，並稱徐財長來滬後迄未獲晤，兌現業務亦無變更，一仍原有無限制兌現之辦法，深望各界勿輕信流言。</p>
<p>又查日來四行門口擠兌之情形，日見嚴重。擠兌之人羣中，更多制服階級。而擠兌銀圓之行列，較黃金行列尤爲熟烈。以中央銀行爲例，日來平均每日可接受兌現之市民，約有一千五百人，而其中兌銀元者，佔千人左右。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕據輸管會方面透露：上月份全國出口結匯，共達二千零二萬九千美元。數宇較之過去，增加甚多，蓋因出口額因外匯轉移證實施後，大有提高之故。</p>
<p>十一月第一週之出口結匯，僅有四百六十二萬美元，第二週竟减至二百八十六萬美元，第三週增至六百萬美元，第四週升至六百五十萬美元。惟其中民營出口，仍少增加，最初兩週平均爲一百七十萬美元，外匯移轉證實行後，增至一百九十萬美元，爲數至微。政府出口額第一週爲一百九十萬美元，第二週爲一百二十萬美元，第三週已增爲四百十三萬美元，第四週增至四百五十萬美元。就增加之速率而言，遠較民間出口貸額爲高。全月而論，政府出口結匯爲一千二百七十七萬美元，佔全部出口之百分之六十四。民營出口七百二十三萬美元，佔全部出口右分之三十六。所謂政府出口，僅包括紗布冰蛋礦砂食糖而言，中信局及其他國營公司之出口，均不計在內。</p>

<p>昨日外匯移轉證市勢趨俏，晨開二十九元半，進口商吸胃甚濃，一路直升，迄收仍堅站於三十二元高價。一般觀察，此與報載戰局好轉，利多消息刺激所致，刻下已領進口許可證　望之進口商，爲數尙夥，如前綫再傳捷報，今日市價可能再度上揚。又中央銀行僑匯掛牌，昨日亦已提高至三十六元。</p>

<p>銀根緊勢稍戢，市塲暗息退至日拆每千元卅元合月息九角，現鈔籌碼因中央銀行有新金圓券五種發行，亦稍轉寬裕。聞銀錢業方面，因外商銀行已通知各往來行莊，暫時結淸賬戶，拆款較難，故對於往來戶之拆放額，亦相繼收縮。</p>

<p>— 本報特派員　韓清濤</p>
<p>〔本報天津一日訊〕潘陽變色，那是一塲　夢，那是一個突起的風暴，委眼問，變成了另外的一個世界。藩陽之失，當然不是偶然的，如追根尋底，那就是瀋陽黑山間的五六個精銳大軍快速的在先解體。所餘守瀋部隊認大勢巳去，隨後順風轉舵，致造成了「一面倒」的局勢。</p>
<p>最初，是困守瀋陽的大軍，分路出擊，劉玉章率領五十二軍南進，指向營口，於十月三日完成了任務。據說作用有二：一爲支援西進兵團，形成呼應之勢，一爲打通撤退路子。</p>
<p>西進兵團是由赫赫大名的廖躍湘指揮，素稱精銳的新一·新三·新六等三個軍，另外還有四十九，七十一等有名部隊包括在內，任務是援錦州，並向遼西集中，那是十月下旬的開始。行動遲緩，情報不靈，進入彰武，進入新立屯，是那樣的吃力，結果滯留在黑山，新民，新立屯地區，鑄成大錯。</p>
<p>西進兵團，不能前進，東來兵團又打不通到錦州去的塔山那一關，結果，錦州在一塲鏖戰後失守了，東北剿總錦州指揮所主任兼冀熱遼邊區總司令范漢傑，第六兵團司令官　濬泉等被俘，物資損失無算。</p>
<p>西進兵團援救錦州任務未達，旣不能西去，又不退守瀋陽，正在遲疑考慮間，匪用輕裝部隊，首先截襲了各路國軍的輜重，並盡量利用輕騎竄擾，阻擊，使各路國軍捉摸不定，形成紊亂。</p>
<p>廖　湘的指揮所被襲擊了，廖率部突圍後，各軍師已呈動搖，士無鬥志，官無約束能力，敗兵紛逃瀋陽，又衝擊了整個藩陽的士氣和民心。</p>
<p>匪方大部隊，陸續到達新民以西地區，截去了龐大數字的官兵，國軍前方部隊大部瓦解，師，團，營長，被俘和死難的爲數極多。潘裕昆，龍天武等回到瀋陽，萬分悲憤，龍大武竟至昏倒，有「收容一營，我當營長，收容一師，我當師長，再從頭幹起」語，可是事實上竟不容如此了。</p>
<p>瀋陽還有多少兵力呢？五十三軍的兩個師，二零七師一個師，瀋市府新編組的第二守備總隊，拿這樣的民力，守衛瀋陽龐大的市區，以及北陵，東塔，運河三個飛機塲，實在顯得</p>
<p>空虛單薄軍事當局乃調遼南營口的五十二軍，回兵瀋陽，料不到匪從遼西調來一股兵力，在海城截住了去路。</p>
<p>瀋陽外無援軍，內少鬥士，因爲守軍看到新民到黑山間五六個大軍垮台之慘，影響太大，遂發生了動搖，共黨得乘機而入，游說，離間，結果五十三軍的兩個師（軍長周福成爲此大哭，因爲他陷於包園中）等都有了問題。</p>
<p>廿八日夜，進攻瀋東的匪股，被放進十多公里的團山子要隘，東陵等地都有了八路踪跡，二零七師曾奉命馳往作恢復團子山陣地的努力，結果因爲受到牽掣，沒能如願以償，同時瀋北不到十公里的大窪一帶，「八路」也攻上來了，北陵飛機塲，首先受到了匪砲的威脅。</p>
<p>東北剿匪總司令衛立煌，在遼西會戰中，對於指揮部署，旣遲疑不決，在瀋陽緊張中，又慌了手脚，沒作有計劃的佈置，唯一寄託希望的五十二軍，又從營口回不來了，一切遂歸於夢幻。</p>

<h3 id="c110">共產主義在中國　（四）　一九四八年九月　院外交委員會編撰 <a href="#c110" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e110" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">110</a></h3>
<p>— 本報編譯室特譯</p>
<p>第二，他認爲合併的二階段的革命，可由除了國民黨中的帝國主義的，封建的和官僚主義的分子以外的一切進步的階層聯合起來，共同促進。這將是「一種新式的革命，完全或部份地由無產階級領導。革命的第一期目的在建立一個新民主社會，一個由各革命階級聯合專政的新政體」</p>
<p>第三，毛氏主張暫時採行溫和的社會主義。「新民主主義」的經濟制度包括銀行，實業和商業機關的收歸國有，因爲這些機關「規模較大，不適於個人經營」。沒有土地的貧苦農民照常可自沒收的大地主的地產分得適當的土地。其他私有財產和企業，如果不是過份鉅大的，大都仍可任其繼續持有。所以不立刻試行完全的社會主義化，因爲「在目前的革命任務，反帝國主義和反封建制度的任務未曾完成以前，社會主義是不可能實施的。」</p>
<p>第四，照毛氏的見解，這聯合專政和中和的社會主義階段，將和孫中山的三民主義取得完全的一致。聯合政體將採用戰鬥的方式以實施三民主義。到了新革命的第二階段，社會主義才可以越過三民主義的界限以外，至於這一個階段何時到來却並沒有指出。</p>
<p>第五，在新革命體系下的中國人民將堅持一種政策，「接受社會主義國家蘇聯和國際無產階級的友誼的手。</p>
<p>中共對於毛澤東所主張的各階級統一戰綫已經有了實際的行動。中共於一九四五年初在延安召開第七次全國大會時，曾要求國民政府放棄一黨統治，實現一　民主一政府，亦卽組織包含各　個旅（包括共產黨在內）的聯　內閣。經與國民政府多次談判　、由於共產黨不肯接受足以妨　具零取全部政權的希望的條件，組織有共產黨參加的聯合內開的努力終於全部失敗。但是一新民主主義一的政治目標雖不能達到，中共依舊保存了中國共產主　的政治方針和宣傳根據。</p>
<p>一般人對於「新民主主義」的　　和的的」或有的的解釋大槪如下：</p>
<p>中共由經騐得到許多敎口，他們已經改變初衷，不復像以前那樣革命的了。他們正努力於像我們所見到的改革工作。他們太現實生義化，不願向離開目標太遠的革命　續努力。他們侈談革命，可是他們現在所追求的革命却是牛步化的聯合其他進步份子以改良的方式來促進它的。</p>
<p>他們是任何「新政」　反對保守，倡導民主者的忠實的盟友。他們準備而且願意循規蹈矩行事，延宕他們的革命工作而從事改良工作。我們「自由份子」如果能得到他們的帮助，使我們的改良工作眞正合宜適當，那麼我們可能把他們的革命永遠拖延下來，使我們更樂觀的和平改革的希望成爲事實。其次，當他們應用「民主」這個名詞時，他們所指的意義和我們所指的是相同的</p>
<p>復次，共產主義隨各國國情而有不同。中共是溫和的農村改革者，因此上述種種卽使不適用於一般共產黨，仍可適用於中國共產黨。以上是一部份人對於毛澤東的「新民主主義」的溫和的看法，現在再說一個訓練有素的共產黨員對於毛氏的「新民主主義」抱怎樣的見解：</p>
<p>毛氏發見一個使反對派分裂的絕妙方法。他儘量吸收非共產黨員的支持，帮助共產黨完成使命，而使少數極端反共產份子趨於孤立。他儘量利用介乎共產主義。與各種進步的改良運動之間的騎牆派。</p>
<p>他將馬克思和昂格爾所主張的革命必須有二次，一次反對封建主義一次反對資本主義的舊學說，和把二次革命合併爲一次的「永久革命」的學說加以調和。他把列寗合併二期革命的功績加以普遍化，使它不但適用於蘇聯，而且可適用於中國或其他任何國家。爲了合併兩個革命階段，必須把聯合各階級的概念灌輸到一黨專政的以往的共黨理論中去，作爲過渡到完全共產黨統治的最有效的一種工具。</p>
<p>同時毛氏仍保留「無產階級專政」的原則於革命的統一戰綫。在這陣綫無　階級仍居主要地位，一直到可以實行無產階級專政的時期爲止。</p>
<p>毛氏在討論到經濟政　時，摭取了列寗在一九二一年所採取的新經濟政策的要點。他承認要發展國家必須容許若干私人企業繼續存在，芷如列寗在一九二一年所承認的。但是他把次序重新布置，而將新經濟政策與資本主義發展的合併置於社會主義革命與無產階級專政之前。同時他把集體制的初步提前與資本主義的發展同時並進，使過渡時期順利而加速地進行。</p>
<p>毛氏把列寗所主張共產黨參加非共產黨的學說更推進一層。列寗僅說共產黨在可能獲得議會中的席次時，不應避免此舉。毛氏則更指出共產黨的參加聯合內閣，並不依靠投票的實力，而基於雙方的誠意合作。這可使共產黨在政府內的權力儘量擴大，而共產黨對國家的責任則儘量减少。</p>
<p>共產黨對「新民主主義」的看法巳如上述，再說我們對於它的觀感究竟怎樣呢？下面的見解似乎是値得提出的：</p>
<p>一，它是蘇俄革命以來在蘇聯國境以外出版的最重要的共產黨著作。</p>
<p>二，自從一八四八年以來，共產黨文獻對於共產主義思想的供獻沒有比它更大的。</p>
<p>三，它的欺人的效果和它的共產主義的正統思想一樣地值得注意。</p>
<p>四，它更明顯地說明共產主義對於民主立憲並沒有眞正的同情。</p>
<p>五，它澈底表明共產黨的經濟和政治的分析有助於政權的爭取，並加强逐漸脫離爲克思學說的趨勢。</p>
<p>六，它並不重視暴力革命，因爲它有方發能把暴力革命延緩到奪得專政權以後</p>
<p>七，它至少造成了美國政策的一個代價重大的錯誤</p>
<p>八，這學說最有利於共產黨的時代已經過去，可是共產黨的世界革命的希望存在一天，它對於共產主義理論和戰略的貢獻將繼續保特其重要性。</p>
<p>四　第二次內戰　甲　蘇聯的干涉</p>
<p>蘇聯於一九四五年八月九日加入遠東戰爭，正在美國投擲原子炸彈於廣島以後第二天，戰事結束以前一星期。蘇聯軍隊長騙直入中國東北，毫不費力地佔領了除西伯里亞和日本以外亞洲最大的產煤和工業區域。他們更接受了東北日軍的投降。</p>
<p>當時曾議定蘇聯應將東北的管理權移交於國民政府軍隊，同時又議定蘇聯得恢復其一九〇五年日俄戰爭或以後所委棄的遠東方面的一部份權利和財產。換言之，蘇聯得收回庫頁島南部和東北的鐵路權。但沒有議定日軍交出的軍器不得移轉到中共手裏，也沒有議定蘇聯不得以戰利品的藉口要求拆除東北的工業設備。於是上述兩件事蘇聯都照辦了，而且還佔據着大通旅順一直到現在。</p>
<p>一九四五年八月十四日蘇聯與中國簽訂三十年期限的友好條約，並於八月二十六日卽毛澤東到達重慶和蔣委員長商談統一問題的那天，把條文公佈出來。由此透露了「和平」的曙光。</p>
<p>國軍和共軍開始爭奪華北日軍所交出的軍器，土地和工業。這競爭在共產黨方面是遠背了盟軍最高統帥麥克阿塞所頒佈的命令，卽日軍全部投降應由中央政府當局接受。</p>
<p>數十年來，大連港和南滿鐵路一向是中國本部和東北間的主要通路。中國政府目被拒絕「共同使用」大連港以後，所有軍隊的移動不得不經由山海關取道迂迴難行的陸路，或利用不適當的補助海港。在日軍投降時，國民政府的軍隊幾乎全部在西南方面。國軍向東北移動，首先受到長江以南鐵路被日軍毀壤的阻碍。加之在日本投降以後，共軍復拆毀了長江以北的許多鐵路綫。因了這初期情形和中共及蘇聯的舉動，遂使國軍到達東北的時間延宕下來。</p>
<p>十一月二日蘇聯宣佈開始撤退東北軍隊，中國政府還沒有凖備跟踵移入。由海路移入東北的國軍發覺中共軍隊已經佔領了重要的據點。其他由陸路進發的軍隊不得不爭取自中國本部通至關外的鐵路綫上的重要據點山海關。於是國共之間的第二次內戰便很快地再度掀起了。在一九四五年十一月間，凡是兩軍接觸的地方普遍地發生了戰事。</p>
<p>戰事的進行複雜而慘烈。中共不再是弱者，國軍黯然克復了延安，並據有若干要衝城市和鐵路綫，可是共軍一面失掉一個地區，一面又很快的奪得另一他區</p>
<p>戰事的進行方式很是有趣，但這裏我們所關心的不在此點。問題是：蘇聯千涉遠東對於中國軍隊的均勢發生怎樣的影響？答案雖不能正確，但可能是非常簡單的。在第二次大戰結束以前，中國紅軍的實力約計五十萬人，軍器並不十分充足。現在他們的實力已三倍於前，武器亦富足有餘、</p>
<p>中共取得日軍的軍火和其他物炎不是以公開或正式的移交方式，而是秘密的私相授受。因此他們雖非完全控制東北，却己使東北陷於癱瘓狀態。他們佔有了東北的工業資產，這些資產雖然不過是些殘餘之物，但是遠勝於他們以前所獲得的任何資產。他們沒有充分利用那裏的工業，但是急切需要道些工業的國足政府管轄下的區域，却一些他不能染指。</p>
<p>中國的內戰現在已再度發生了，但和內戰結束時的情形已完全不同。國共雙方實力的均勢已有劇烈的變動。在一九三七年爭取生存是中共的勝利，現在也許會是國民黨的勝利了。蘇聯的干涉遠東戰爭是這一個變動的最大因素。（未完）</p>

<p>[Report from our Bengbu Office, 3rd] It is learned that the Xuzhou Pacification Headquarters held a military conference on the 2nd and made specific decisions on the current war situation. Military sources also stated that the future development of the war and whether significant victories can be achieved depend on the progress of the southward army corps in the Huai River area.</p>
<p>[Report from our Bengbu Office, 3rd] Military observers expressed confusion about the recent battles in the Bengbu-Suxian area and raised the following questions: Besides establishing a strong pocket-shaped defense, the National Army is also mobilizing a large force to strengthen its position. If the communists believe they have considerable strength, they should launch their intended offensive promptly. However, their main force has been moving south for nearly a week, yet they still hesitate and look around. If they don't believe they have a decisive advantage, they should retreat early to escape this river-crossed battlefield, which is unfavorable to them, and avoid being completely annihilated. Military personnel believe that the communists' current hesitation indicates they are trapped in a dilemma.</p>
<p>[Report from our Bengbu Office, 3rd] The remaining communist bandits on our front are moving north. After joining the main force near Suxian, their 6th Column is still resisting in the area north of Cao Lao Ji, attempting to block the advance of the National Army's right-wing corps. Fierce battles occurred 15 li north of Cao Lao Ji today. Also, the Huang Wei corps on the left side made further progress eastward from Da Ying Ji today.</p>
<p>[Report from our Bengbu Office, 3rd] The military announced at 9 PM tonight: (1) The communist 6th Column, which was blocking the National Army's advance at Yi Zhan Gang in front of Bengbu to cover the retreat of its main force, has been defeated. (Our Li Corps, attacking north along the Jinpu Railway, defeated a regiment of the column north of Cao Lao Ji and Gao Lao Jia this morning and continued to advance.) (2) The Liu Corps on the right wing, with the assistance of the air force, overcame communist resistance, captured Wang Zhuang, killed many communists, and advanced to the Jiu Wan Ji and Ren He Ji area. (3) After annihilating a communist battalion at Zhou Jia Kou, a unit on the left wing has crossed the Bei Fei River and is in pursuit.</p>
<p>[Report from Central News Agency, Nanjing, 3rd] Military news: The large-scale annihilation battle between Suxian and Guzhen is developing favorably. Powerful National Army corps are pressing the communists, who are shrinking between Suxian and Guzhen, from all directions, from Xuzhou in the north to the Huai River in the south and from Hongze Lake to the Grand Canal in the east. By the evening of the 2nd...</p>
<p>[Report from Central News Agency, Bengbu, 3rd] The National Army is approaching the victory stage in the Suxian-Bengbu battle. The communists who crossed the Bei Fei River continued to flee north across the Hui River last night. The National Army advancing north, under the cover of a powerful air force, crossed Xin Qiao this morning and is pressing toward the south bank of the Hui River. The National Army advancing south is approaching Jia Gou. The National Army deployed on both sides of the Jinpu Railway between Suxian and Lingbi is also exerting its iron fists, launching a coordinated pincer attack from east and west. The Chen Liu communist forces trapped in this marshy pocket-shaped area are seeing the situation worsening and retreating northwest, attempting to avoid complete annihilation.</p>
<p>[Report from United Press, Nanjing, 3rd] The East China theater has entered a decisive stage today. The Xuzhou National Army is attacking the three communist columns astride the Jinpu Railway south towards the Huai River. The National Army can meet up with the 12th Army Corps by advancing 30 miles southwest. It can reach the salient position held by the National Army on the north bank of the Hui River by advancing 60 miles southeast. The communist force attacking the Hui River line consists of seven columns, approximately 100,000 men. It is reported that they have shifted to the defensive, leaving only a small number of troops to attack in place, while the rest of the force has moved entirely. One column is heading northwest, and the other six columns are advancing south to confront the National Army advancing south from Xuzhou. The battle between the two armies will produce a decisive result.</p>
<p>[Report from our Zhenjiang Office, 3rd] The National Army in Huaiyin took the initiative to withdraw on the 1st. Officials say it was in coordination with the Bengbu battle.</p>

<p>Bengbu Situation More Stable, No Communist Traces Within 40 Li North of the Huai River</p>
<p>[Report from Central News Agency, Bengbu, 3rd] There are no communist traces within 40 li north of the Huai River, with Bengbu as the center. The situation in Bengbu is becoming more stable. Passenger and freight transportation on the Jinpu Railway between Bengbu and Pukou will return to normal within three days.</p>
<p>[Report from Central News Agency, Bengbu, 3rd] In the battle where the National Army captured Cao Lao Ji and Cao Lao Ji Station north of Bengbu, a total of two regiments of the Chen communist 6th Column and part of the 13th Column were annihilated. Also, the remaining Chen communist forces on the south bank of the Hui River still have an incomplete 6th Column, acting as the rearguard, putting up stubborn resistance to cover the retreat of their main force to the north. The National Army advancing north is attacking village by village, destroying them one by one.</p>
<p>[Report from Central News Agency, Bengbu, 3rd] The National Army has inflicted severe blows on the communists in the area north of the Fei River. Our Liu and Li corps launched a full-scale attack yesterday. After suffering losses, approximately 50,000 men from the remaining Chen communist 2nd, 6th, and 13th Columns retreated northwest from the He Ji and Hu Gou Ji area. In this battle, over 4,000 communists were killed, and the captured spoils of war are being inventoried. Furthermore, the main force of a unit of the communist 6th Column near Cao Lao Ji on the Jinpu Railway front in Bengbu was bravely encircled and suppressed by our corps, killing over 3,000 communists and capturing over 200 machine guns and rifles. The communists collapsed and fled to the area north of Guzhen. Our vanguard has approached Guzhen. Moreover, a military spokesperson told reporters today in a delighted tone that our southward corps are advancing rapidly, forming a pincer attack. Good news should be reported in the coming days.</p>
<p>[Report from our Bengbu Office, 2nd] (Late) The military released a comprehensive report as follows: The Huang Wei corps on the left flank of the National Army defeated a unit of the Liu communist 1st and 2nd Columns, totaling three regiments, near Shuang Dui on the east bank of the Bei Fei River. Approximately 50,000 men from the Chen Yi communist 2nd, 6th, 11th, and 13th Columns, who had fled to the area between the Bei Fei River and the Huai River, have been severely attacked by the Li and Liu corps in coordination with the air force from the Nanjing-Xuzhou-Bengbu bases. The communists are showing signs of collapse. The communists surrounding Xin Qiao directly north of Bengbu were also severely damaged through the cooperation of land and air forces, and the communists began to retreat. Another group of communists crossed the Bei Fei River on the 1st, attempting to harass the left wing and contain the National Army's forces. However, their attempt was crushed by the National Army's counterattack. It is said that since the National Army established an iron net on the Bei Fei River, the Qiu and Sun corps moving south have used ostrich tactics to monitor the communists from behind. The more than 200,000 remaining communist bandits who are struggling between the Hui and Fei rivers are in a state of panic and probably dare not launch a major decisive battle against the National Army in an active manner.</p>

<p>Residents of the Capital Busy Evacuating, Ignoring Danger and Crowding to Climb Aboard Trains and Ships, Transportation Authorities Are Trying to Improve the Situation</p>
<p>[Report from our Nanjing Office, 3rd] Amidst the tense war situation, the residents of Nanjing are busy evacuating. Trains and ships are extremely crowded. Xiaguan Wharf and the railway station are filled with passengers and a large number of boxes and luggage waiting for trains and ships. Among them, many have been waiting for several days and still cannot leave. Ships going west from Nanjing are almost stopping in the middle of the Yangtze River. Passengers approach in small boats and climb aboard by hoisting themselves up with ropes, which is extremely dangerous. The weak and women and children can only sigh in despair at the ships. Although there are many trains departing from Xiaguan Station to Shanghai and Hangzhou every day, each one is overloaded. Whether or not one has a ticket is no longer a matter of consideration for passengers, but whether or not one has the strength to board depends. Many passengers hold tickets or assigned military tickets but cannot board the train. Every time a train enters the station, those waiting for the train swarm up without waiting for the passengers to disembark. Doors and windows are their entrances. The train that departs early in the morning enters the station after midnight. Some passengers wait at the station before the curfew the previous night in order to board the train at midnight and occupy a seat. Before dawn, those who arrive later have no place to stand. All assigned car numbers and seat numbers are invalid. Only the order in the sleeper car is slightly better, but sleeper car tickets cannot be purchased without the help of high-ranking officials. Chen Qitian, Minister of Industry and Commerce, planned to go to Shanghai on the 3rd to handle important official business, but he was unable to purchase a sleeper car ticket and could not make the trip. In the past, there were very few passengers on the Nanjing-Shanghai flights. Now, they are also fully booked every day. This crowded evacuation phenomenon in the capital has been going on for several days. It is reported that the transportation authorities are trying to improve the situation.</p>
<p>[Report from our Nanjing Office, 3rd] After the Executive Yuan decided on the measures for officials of various agencies to evacuate their families back to their hometowns, the order was delivered to the affiliated agencies on the 3rd. The Ministry of Transportation is now asking the agencies to compile the number of evacuees in order to arrange special evacuation trains, so as to solve the problem of traffic order in a short period of time. Minister of Transportation Yu Dawei told reporters that the travel expenses for families returning to their hometowns will not be affected by ticket adjustments. That is, even if fares are adjusted during the specified period, families returning to their hometowns will still be charged at the current price. Two evacuation trains are designated as special trains every day. It is expected that the overcrowding situation will be reduced after the implementation.</p>
<p>[Report from Central News Agency, Nanjing, 3rd] Zhang Yaoming, Commander of the Capital Garrison Headquarters, issued a notice on the 3rd stipulating measures for the evacuation of passengers and materials at the Nanjing-Shanghai Railway Station. In addition, in order to address the congestion of passengers at the Xiaguan Station and wharf and the time-consuming evacuation, the Headquarters announced that starting from the evening of the 3rd, all passengers carrying luggage should temporarily postpone leaving the city. Normal passage will resume from 6 AM on the 5th.</p>

Long-distance telephone calls should be particularly flexible, and if there are difficulties, the security agencies should provide assistance. Employees with excellent service performance may be reported to the Garrison Headquarters for commendation.</p>

<p>Madame Chiang Kai-shek to Meet with the U.S. President, Previously Visited Marshall and Had a Long Conversation, Truman Says He Does Not Intend to Send MacArthur to China</p>
<p>[Report from Central News Agency, Washington, 2nd] It was learned from official sources on the evening of the 2nd that Madame Chiang Kai-shek will visit President Truman in early next week. Truman has expressed a deep welcome to Madame Chiang Kai-shek. Madame Chiang Kai-shek will also meet with Mrs. Truman at the Blair House (the President's temporary residence) across from the White House. The State Department announced that Madame Chiang Kai-shek will formally visit Secretary of State Marshall next week.</p>
<p>[Report from the United States Information Service, Washington, 2nd] President Truman held his first formal press conference since the November election on the 2nd. Mr. Truman said that Madame Chiang Kai-shek has made an appointment to meet with him. The President also revealed while answering other questions that he does not intend to send MacArthur to China. A reporter asked: Does the President intend to issue a policy statement on the situation in China? Truman said that he has issued such a statement three times and has nothing more to say now.</p>
<p>[Report from Associated Press, Washington, 3rd] President Truman's three past statements were:</p>
<p>(1) December 15, 1945, the President declared: "As China moves toward peace and unity, the United States stands prepared to assist the Chinese Government in every reasonable way, as the Chinese Government expands its basis, China's peaceful unity and democratic reform can be achieved."</p>
<p>(2) December 18, 1946, the President declared: "As China moves toward peace and a wise democratic government, we are prepared to aid China, but to avoid becoming involved in China's internal strife, we will adhere to a policy of assisting the Chinese people in building peace and economic recovery."</p>
<p>(3) February 18, 1948, the President declared: "The development of the situation in China is not as we had hoped, and the assistance given by the United States, even in very small amounts, cannot substitute for the necessary actions that only the Chinese Government itself can take."</p>
<p>[Report from United Press, Washington, 3rd] Madame Chiang, accompanied by Mrs. Marshall, traveled from Virginia to Washington on the 2nd, visiting Secretary of State Marshall, who is undergoing a physical examination at Walter Reed Hospital, from 6 PM to the evening, and talked for about an hour. The length of this visit clearly indicates that it was not an ordinary visit. It is possible to visit again on the 3rd.</p>
<p>[Report from Associated Press, Washington, 2nd] Madame Chiang Kai-shek has begun activities here and will meet with President Truman within days. It is also heard that Madame Chiang Kai-shek will visit Mrs. Truman. Smith, Chairman of the Committee on Oversight of Foreign Aid Programs of the U.S. Congress, said: This committee is scheduled to meet on the 3rd and should listen to Madame Chiang Kai-shek's report. I firmly believe that this committee will agree to listen to the report, but it is also equally certain that this committee has no right to call for emergency military aid to China. The continuation of military or military supplies to China should be decided by the President, the Secretary of State, and the Joint Chiefs of Staff. What we urgently hope for is to help China recover.</p>

<p>MacArthur Cares About Our Situation, But Should Still Stay in Japan Due to His Responsibilities</p>
<p>[Report from Associated Press, Tokyo, 3rd] People close to General MacArthur said on the 3rd that since President Truman has announced that he will not send MacArthur to China, MacArthur felt relieved that the suspense had been resolved and was quite pleased. A senior source said: MacArthur has been in the military his whole life and is of course interested in the trip to China, but he believes that his responsibilities lie in staying in Japan to rebuild it. Although MacArthur did not doubt his own ability to reverse the situation in China, some subordinates believed that it would be a futile effort, so they may have dissuaded MacArthur from going to China. The initial reaction in Japan to the President's declaration was excellent. Most Japanese do not want MacArthur to leave, but many also believe that it would be a good strategy if MacArthur used his achievements in governing Japan to solve difficulties and rebuild peace and unity in China. It is also learned that MacArthur has told his subordinates about strategic plans to improve the situation in China. It is further learned that he has been very concerned about the situation in China for a long time. Another telegram from Washington on the 3rd attracted his attention, which was that the Soviet representative to the Far East Commission, Pan Youxin, attacked MacArthur's occupation administration. People close to MacArthur said that he regarded Pan's words as "propaganda" and did not bother to pay attention to them. Although the Allied Headquarters has repeatedly received requests from news reporters to issue a statement in response to Pan, not a word has been announced so far. A U.S. official said that this type of statement from the Soviet Union has no effect on MacArthur.</p>

<h3 id="e20">Rapidly Determine an Asian Revival Plan <a href="#e20" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c20" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">20</a></h3>
<p>The United Nations Economic Commission for Asia and the Far East has recently been meeting in Labusdong City, Hanzhou, to review major plans for Asian economic recovery, attracting the attention of people from various countries concerned in the East. Especially today, when the Asian crisis is deepening, the commission's discussion of this issue is felt to be of extraordinary significance.</p>
<p>Indian representative Mr. Taisai expressed his views on the 2nd, believing that if Asia does not have a plan similar to the European Recovery Program, the forces of communism will inevitably control the entire continent. Therefore, he advocated that the commission should pass the $13 billion Asian Recovery Program. At the same time, he expressed dissatisfaction with the American government's emphasis on Europe and neglect of Asia, saying, "The recent American statement that Asia should be developed by private capital is a mistaken view. Only the Marshall Plan currently implemented in Western Europe can meet Asia's urgent needs. Western powers should not on the one hand call on Eastern countries to rectify their internal affairs, while on the other hand not provide assistance to enable us to do so. To think that the Western European recovery plan is sufficient to ensure the entire world is not threatened by international communism is both a mistake and an absurdity. It must be understood that the European Recovery Program may be able to preserve Europe for a time, but if Asia does not have a similar recovery program, communism will ultimately achieve total victory." After reading Mr. Taisai's speech, every sentence is the truth, and every word is good advice, which can be said to be truly heartwarming. But I wonder what the American people who advocate emphasizing Europe and neglecting Asia think of it.</p>
<p>Looking at Asia today, we certainly do not want to frighten the public by saying how severe the Asian crisis is. However, the facts placed before our eyes are ironclad. Whether you are willing or not, you cannot help but admit that the chaotic phenomenon in Southeast Asia shows the severity of the threat of communist forces felt by various countries, and the stalemate in the Korean issue and the rebellion in South Korea are enough to illustrate that Northeast Asia is also in imminent danger. Coupled with the rapid decline of the situation in China, the communist troops have almost invaded the heart of the government. Looking to the future, there is much to be done with our efforts. Under such a critical situation, if the Western powers do not want to safeguard world peace, they must first rescue Asia. The gains and losses are clear at a glance. The American diplomatic authorities have not yet made a final decision on the Chinese crisis, and still say that the entire Asia should be developed by private capital and do not want to adopt the Asian Recovery Program. No matter from which perspective you observe it, it is still unwise of American diplomacy. If this delay continues, it will inevitably create a historic mistake in Asia and will be regretted too late.</p>
<p>Who can not recognize that China is the only stabilizing force in Asia, and its every move is enough to affect the overall situation. "To conquer Asia, you must first conquer China." The Japanese militarists thought so in the past, and the new aggressive country today—the Soviet Union—also thinks so. The Chinese Communists' armed rebellion and desire to seize power are harboring the insidious conspiracy to act as a vanguard for the Communist International. The Chinese government and people are sparing no effort to "sincerely seek assistance," not entirely for their own sake, but also for the sake of the entire Asia not being threatened by communist forces. Some say that the United States not only has a moral responsibility to aid China, but it is also an act that benefits both itself and others, which can be called the fairest and most correct argument. If the United States sees itself as a rich man and others as "beggars," only has a kind of "almsgiving" mentality, and even loses heart halfway, it will inevitably harm others and itself!</p>
<p>The President recently made a solemn statement to Mr. Fang En, Vice President of the Associated Press in Beijing, regarding the Marshall Plan for Asia. The general public in China does not hope that the United States will declare bankruptcy by aiding China and other Asian countries, but all believe that the United States should implement the Marshall Plan in Asia. Therefore, in the Far East Economic Committee, except for the Soviet Union, no country's representative did not express support. However, by studying the Soviet Union's motives for opposing the Asian Marshall Plan and listening to the speech of the Soviet representative, Mr. Novikov, one can "see through his tricks." Novikov said, "The Soviet Union opposes solving Asian problems with the Asian Marshall Plan because the Asian Marshall Plan will turn the vast areas of Asia into objects of aggression by Anglo-American imperialism." The implied meaning is self-evident. All Asian countries are sincerely seeking assistance, but the United States is still hesitant and looking around, making people feel that the American foreign policy is truly "unfathomable." I hope that the American diplomatic authorities will reconsider the speech of the Indian representative Mr. He Zhang. What to do and where to go, make a wise decision quickly!</p>
<h3 id="e21">Legislative Yuan Urges Hainan Island to Become a Province; Executive Yuan Principally Accepts; Orders Ministry of Interior and Relevant Agencies to Prepare Appropriately; Tax Revenue and Governance of Territory Still Need Planning <a href="#e21" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c21" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">21</a></h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 3rd] Regarding the matter of Hainan Island becoming a province, the Legislative Yuan consulted the Executive Yuan, requesting immediate implementation. The Executive Yuan has principally indicated acceptance and has recently replied to the Legislative Yuan, saying: "Your esteemed Yuan's consultation No. 294 on the 17th of September, 37th year, is fully understood. The Executive Yuan principally accepts the proposal for the establishment of Hainan Island as a province. However, the total annual tax revenue of the island's sixteen counties in the 36th year, combined from provincial and county levels, is only about 1,300 gold yuan. Among them, Baisha, Baoting, and Ledong counties are entirely dependent on the provincial treasury for funding. The local area is barren, and finances are exhausted. This is something that should be planned for before the province is established. Furthermore, the island is surrounded by sea on all sides, and the entire territory is mountainous. Bandit troops have been entrenched for many years, appearing and disappearing unpredictably in remote mountains and coastal areas. Currently, the only accessible places on the island are Haikou in the north and Yulin in the south. It is necessary to first organize and train security forces to suppress them before security can be ensured and administrative orders can be implemented. This is something that should be planned for before the province is established. Moreover, in addition to the main island, the surrounding islands are numerous, such as the Dongsha, Xisha, Zhongsha, and Nansha islands, scattered like stars in the southernmost territorial waters of our country. How they should be administered to form a constellation guarding the area and secure the territory is something that should be planned for before the province is established. The above points are all factual issues that must be considered. It seems appropriate to prepare for them in advance and gradually resolve them so that after the province is established, various facilities can be smoothly promoted, not only forming a province but also serving as a frontier defense. This differs slightly from the steps in your esteemed Yuan's decision to establish a province, but the intention is the same. The Ministry of Interior has already been ordered to consult with relevant agencies to prepare appropriately and implement it at the appropriate time. Furthermore, funds for pacifying the province will be generously allocated under the provincial and municipal subsidy budget item for the next year. With your prior approval, we respectfully request your review."</p>

The Ministry of Finance has not only cleared military agencies from deducting transportation tools for salt but has also telegraphed the provincial government to order the Bank of Taiwan to open Shanghai-Taiwan exchange. The Taiwan government is currently considering it. In addition, 250,000 tons of Taiwan salt will be smuggled to Japan in the coming year.</p>

The work of suppressing the rebellion must be completed, and the forces of suppressing the rebellion must be strengthened. All colleagues in the education and culture circles who love truth, uphold right and wrong, and recognize the crisis must not hesitate to actively contribute to suppressing the rebellion.

<h3 id="e30">Next Year's Raw Cotton Supply: A Unified Planning Method is Proposed, Expected to Obtain About 3 Million Market Dan of Foreign Cotton <a href="#e30" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c30" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">30</a></h3>
<p>[This newspaper, Nanjing, 3rd] In order to solve the problem of raw cotton supply, the Ministry of Industry and Commerce has recently drafted three measures for unified planning of raw cotton supply in the 38th year and submitted them to the Executive Yuan for approval. Once approved, they can be implemented immediately. The three measures are as follows: (1) It is proposed that the US Aid Application Committee exchange 50% of the export portion of all US cotton 399,065 bales for yarn and cloth for quick export, which can purchase about 200,000 bales of foreign cotton, totaling 800,000 market dan. (2) It is proposed to allocate 40 million US dollars from the foreign exchange deposited in this gold yuan and 50% of the domestic sales funds exchanged for yarn and cloth for all US cotton, to the Central Bank, limited to purchasing 200,000 bales of foreign cotton, totaling 800,000 market dan, within this year. (3) Supervise state-run and private yarn mills to export as much as possible 20% of the total national yarn and cloth production, in accordance with regulations, to exchange for foreign cotton, totaling about 1.6 million market dan. The above three items total about 3 million market dan of foreign cotton, which is an emergency measure to maintain the national textile industry in the 38th year.</p>
<p>[This newspaper, Nanjing, 3rd] According to statistics from the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, the actual number of spindles operating in China is currently 3.6 million, requiring about 704,000 market dan of raw cotton per month, totaling 8.448 million market dan per year. Domestic cotton production is far from sufficient, so it is necessary to plan ahead.</p>

<p>[Associated Press, Berlin, 2nd] Britain, the United States, and France have announced their refusal to recognize the new Berlin city government and have withdrawn the liaison officers formerly stationed at the city hall. US military commander Howley said that the Germans who established a divided government were committing a crime and that the Soviet Union was systematically destroying the four-power agreement.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Berlin, 2nd, Associated Press] Britain, the United States, and France today ordered their liaison officers to withdraw from the Soviet-controlled city government, thus eliminating the last symbol of cooperation between the Western three countries and the Soviet Union in Berlin. At that time, the Soviet side refused to allow the liaison officers of the three countries to withdraw unless their luggage was first searched. After a five-hour standoff, the Soviet side allowed it. Informed sources said that the next step may be to make the German mark issued by the West the only legal currency in West Berlin, although the mark issued by the Soviet side will still circulate informally. Both Berlin city governments met today. The legitimate government met in the American sector, and the German communist government met in the Soviet sector city hall. Berlin university students held an anti-Western demonstration in the Soviet sector.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Berlin, 2nd] The German communist city government, meeting in the Soviet sector, adopted a 16-point plan of action on the 2nd, including the nationalization of city industries and the confiscation of property of "Nazis and war criminals." At the same time, Soviet military commander-in-chief Sokolovsky declared on the 2nd that the Soviet Union had recognized the communist city government as the legitimate government of Berlin.</p>

<h3 id="e43">Opposition to Returning Ruhr Mining Sovereignty to Germany; French Parliament Passes Resolution; West Germany's Three Occupation Zones to Merge <a href="#e43" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c43" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">43</a></h3>
<p>[Agencie France-Presse, Paris, 2nd] The French Parliament today, by a vote of 377 to 181, passed a motion proposed by the majority party. The motion requested the French government to declare to the British and American governments the French people's support for the government's protest against the British and American governments' proposal to place the sovereignty of the Ruhr mining industry under the control of a future German government, as announced in Ordinance No. 75, and unanimously opposed it. A motion proposed by Communist Party members, requesting Parliament to send a committee to investigate the current situation in Germany, especially in the Ruhr region, was defeated by a vote of 411 to 181.</p>
<p>Foreign Minister Schuman stated beforehand, "The German and French occupation zones will soon merge with the British and American zones. For the benefit of France, we wish this to happen smoothly. Currently, the three countries' commanders-in-chief in Germany are reviewing the terms of the merger, which do not include France's participation in the Ruhr control mechanism as a condition for the merger of the three zones. After the merger of the three zones, France should be able to participate in the Ruhr control mechanism on an equal footing." Regarding the decision of Britain and the United States to return the sovereignty of the Ruhr mining industry to a future German government, Schuman said, "France fundamentally opposes this decision. However, discussing this issue is not currently the most pressing matter. This should be stipulated in the peace treaty. Our goal is to prevent the re-establishment of any centralized state that endangers peace, whether it be a capitalist or nationalist centralized state."</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, London, 2nd] The six-nation conference on the Ruhr issue did not discuss the issue today as it awaited the US response to France's proposals on the management of the Ruhr mining industry. However, it continued to study the draft of the future international administrative status of the Ruhr.</p>

<p>[[United States Information Service, Washington, 2nd] Martin, chairman of the American Newspaper Guild, told reporters here today that he hoped to discuss the organization of a new international journalist organization with British journalists in January. He is currently in discussions with the British side. This "International Free Journalist Organization" will unite journalist groups from the United States, the United Kingdom, Belgium, the Netherlands, Luxembourg, and the Scandinavian countries, as well as all other free nations in the world. Two weeks ago, Martin withdrew from the meeting of the International Organization of Journalists held in Budapest. He said that the reason he withdrew the American Newspaper Guild from the above organization was because the Soviet Union and its satellite countries were using the organization's meetings for Soviet propaganda. He said that the number of journalists from free countries at the Budapest meeting was in a ratio of one to two with the number of journalists from the Soviet bloc, failing to achieve any constructive results.</p>

<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 2nd] As high-ranking officers from the French Air Force and the Italian Army arrive here one after another today, some believe that the two countries are requesting arms loans from the United States. Italian Chief of Staff Marazzani arrived here today to return the visit of US Army Chief of Staff J. Lawton Collins and will tour US Army facilities. French Air Force Minister Morlot and his entourage arrived here to meet with US Air Force officers and to tour Air Force facilities and aircraft factories.

According to the defense plans of the European Union, strong assistance from the United States is expected.</p>
<h3 id="e49">Five, Including Kido, Sato, and Togo, Appeal Again to US Supreme Court; Mei Ru'ao Believes This is Just a Delaying Tactic <a href="#e49" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c49" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">49</a></h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Washington, 2nd] Japanese war criminals Shigenori Shigemitsu, Hoshio Okazaki, Kenryo Sato, Koichi Kido, and Shigenori Togo today applied to the US Supreme Court through their American lawyer, Logan, for an appeal, requesting that the Far East International Military Tribunal's verdict be declared invalid, claiming that the tribunal was illegally established by MacArthur. The charges against the five defendants could not be established under international law or in US civil and military courts, and the conviction was a violation of the US Constitution. The US Supreme Court had previously received appeals from Doihara and Hirota, but Tojo and the other five war criminals who were also sentenced to death had not filed appeals.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 2nd] Mei Ru'ao, the Chinese judge who attended the Far East International Military Tribunal, told the Central News Agency reporter this afternoon that the US Supreme Court has no right to review or amend the Far East International Military Tribunal's verdicts on the 25 top Japanese war criminals. The fact that the defense lawyers of Doihara and the other seven defendants have appealed to the US Supreme Court is tantamount to questioning General MacArthur's personal authority as an American citizen. In their appeal, they are questioning the US Supreme Court not about the verdict of the Far East International Military Tribunal, but about whether MacArthur's execution of the tribunal's verdict in his capacity as an American citizen violates the US Constitution. Dr. Mei continued, although General MacArthur's authority is based on international agreements, it is still subject to the laws of his own country. Therefore, the US Supreme Court must decide whether MacArthur can execute the verdict of the Far East International Military Tribunal. However, the US Supreme Court will certainly not say that MacArthur has no right to execute it, and will support it. The actions taken by the war criminals' defense lawyers are a "delaying tactic" and have no effect on the verdict of the Far East International Military Tribunal itself.</p>

<p>[Associated Press, Washington, 2nd] Soviet Ambassador Pan Yuqing criticized MacArthur at today's regular meeting of the Far Eastern Commission for failing to take "appropriate measures" to disarm Japan. He said, "We have reason to doubt" whether MacArthur is implementing the Far Eastern Commission's resolution on disarming Japan. "Some Americans" are unwilling to endlessly develop Japan's non-war industries, mainly "because Japan will be a strong competitor of American goods." Pan also proposed the original Soviet proposal, advocating the development of Japan's non-war industries and the establishment of an international organization to prevent the revival of Japan's war industries. This proposal was opposed by the United States. The US representative to the Far Eastern Commission, McCoy, said that an international joint management organization should not be established before the final peace treaty is signed.</p>

<h3 id="e53">Korean Commission Appeals to UN General Assembly for North-South Korean Peace Talks to be Held Before US-Soviet Troop Withdrawal <a href="#e53" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c53" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">53</a></h3>
<p>[United Press, Paris, 3rd] The United Nations Korean Commission is strenuously promoting the swift unification of the entire peninsula under the rule of the South Korean government supported by the United States. The Commission criticized the hostile communist state established in the Soviet-occupied area of North Korea. In its final report to the UN General Assembly, the Commission reiterated its endorsement of the May 10 election formula used in both Koreas under the aegis of the United States. The Commission observed the election in South Korea and concurred with the formation of the South Korean government.</p>
<p>It pointed out that the Soviet Union refused the Commission entry into North Korea to observe the elections, and the Communists automatically established their government. The Commission declared that the Korean people all desire unification and that unification must begin before the withdrawal of US and Soviet occupation forces, otherwise, hostile actions may lead to civil war. After the Political Committee stops debating the Palestine issue, the Commission's report will be immediately submitted to the Political Committee. The United States and Australia are promoting a proposal to obtain direct recognition of the Seoul government. The Commission's conclusion states: "Even if the effective administrative authority of the Seoul government has not extended to North Korea, the view must be maintained that this government has the basis for achieving unification through peaceful negotiations. At least, from an economic standpoint, this unification is very important." The Commission declared that some steps to establish peaceful negotiations are imperative and that these negotiations must begin before the withdrawal of the occupying forces, otherwise, civil war may break out. The Commission's report stated: "The Korean issue is only one aspect of the current international relations competition." The Commission believes: "The tensions between North and South Korea have been reduced over time, and all Korean people, regardless of their political tendencies or social standing, are unanimous in their dissatisfaction with the current state of disunity." The Commission believes: "In view of the social, political, and economic well-being of South Korea, rapid unification is absolutely essential." The Commission stated that in the May 10 South Korean elections, 75 percent of the electorate voted, and the results fully demonstrate the free will of the voters.</p>

<p>Rhee Syngman Expresses Dissatisfaction with the UN General Assembly</p>
<p>[United Press, Seoul, 3rd] Korean President Rhee Syngman issued a statement at a press conference today, stating that the UN General Assembly's proposal to postpone the discussion of the Korean issue has been telegraphed by observers attending the General Assembly. This move will only aid communist terrorists and the new government in fighting. The communists always want to buy time to implement communization, so why give them this convenience? It is difficult to understand why the General Assembly cannot decide on the Korean issue now. The US and South Korea have already implemented the plan agreed upon by the General Assembly, so taking final action does not require much time.</p>

<p>[Central News Agency, Seoul, 3rd] The agreement concluded between the two countries stationed in South Korea, originally scheduled to be signed this afternoon, has been postponed to a later date due to errors in the Korean translation. The agreement has 12 articles, stipulating that the United States will provide South Korea with material and technical assistance, but subject to US supervision. The agreement was originally scheduled to be signed today by US Representative to South Korea John J. Muccio and South Korean Prime Minister Lee Beom-seok and Finance Minister Kim Pyo-heon representing the US and South Korea, respectively.</p>
<h3 id="e56">Security Council Decides to Postpone Action on Israel's Membership Application; Political Committee Passes New US Proposal <a href="#e56" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c56" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">56</a></h3>
<p>[United Press, Paris, 3rd] The United Nations Security Council discussed Israel's application for membership today and immediately decided to refer the issue to a special committee, which will include all eleven members of the Security Council. Previously, the US and the UK each held different views. US Representative Jessup urged the Security Council to immediately admit Israel, while UK Representative Cadogan opposed this action, believing that the time was too early and pointing out that the UN General Assembly's Political Committee was still discussing the Palestine partition issue. The Soviet Union supported Israel's request.</p>
<p>[United Press, Paris, 3rd] The US and UK's proposal to merge the Arab part of Palestine with Transjordan was rejected by the UN General Assembly's Political Committee on the 3rd. The merger plan was originally proposed by the late mediator Bernadotte. The Political Committee rejected it by a vote of 26 to 18, with 12 abstentions. US Representative Rusk argued that the Political Committee should pass new articles of the plan separately, without mentioning Bernadotte's recommendations, but instructing the tripartite mediation team to "assist the authorities concerned in finally resolving all important issues." Rusk admitted that the goal was to give the mediation team the power to consider thorny border issues. It is believed that if the US-proposed articles are passed, the Bernadotte recommendations will be mentioned again during negotiations. The Political Committee passed the US-proposed articles by a vote of 42 to 2, with the Soviet bloc and the six Arab countries abstaining unanimously. Therefore, the British and American plan to adopt the Bernadotte plan as the basis for the final settlement of the Holy Land has been completely overturned by the committee. Those who opposed the British and American proposal were the Soviet bloc, the Arab countries, and pro-Israel countries. When the UK and the US tried to insert Bernadotte's border plan into the UN mediation strategy on the 2nd, they were also rejected by the above three opposing groups. The Political Committee's unwillingness to transfer the Arab part of Palestine to the jurisdiction of Transjordan, which is supported by the UK, is tantamount to tacitly approving the Palestine partition plan passed by the UN General Assembly last year. From the debate to the voting, the cloud of the Arab League split finally surfaced. Transjordan is not a member of the United Nations, so it could not vote. The six Arab countries and the Muslim or quasi-Muslim countries unanimously opposed the merger of Palestine into Transjordan, a member of the Arab League.</p>

<p>[United States Information Service, Washington, 2nd] President Truman received reporters for the first time today after the US election. Someone asked whether the rumors that he was planning to reorganize his cabinet were true. The President replied that he had asked every cabinet member to continue to serve at this time, and all cabinet members had agreed. He specifically mentioned Secretary of State Marshall and Secretary of Defense Forrestal. He was asked whether the US defense spending for next year would be limited to $15 billion, as he had previously specified. The President replied that this would be announced when he delivered his budget message to the new Congress in the future. Regarding the issue of cartels in Germany, Truman reminded reporters that when he was the chairman of the Senate Investigating Committee before becoming Vice President, he himself had investigated the cartels in Germany.

<p>[Our Reporter] The Jiangya ship, a regular ship on the Shanghai-Ningbo route of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, encountered danger and sank at Yangmian, Litongsha, outside the Wusongkou at around 8 p.m. last night. The Shanghai Coastal Telegraph of the Ministry of Communications received a distress telegram from the Huazheng ship at 10 p.m. last night, stating that the Jiangya ship had encountered danger and was sinking, and requesting that the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company be notified for rescue. Upon receiving the telegram, the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company immediately dispatched the Feixiang fast ship to the scene for rescue. It is reported that the Jiangya ship was renamed after being taken over from the former Japanese Dongya Shipping Co., Ltd. (formerly Khingan Maru). It has a deadweight of 2,099 tons and can carry 1,186 passengers. It departed at 4:30 p.m. yesterday, leaving port for Ningbo. The number of passengers carried is unknown.</p>
<h3 id="e61">Mayor Wu's Prediction: Index Will Decrease This Month; High Price for Ration Rice is to Prevent Rice Shortage <a href="#e61" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c61" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">61</a></h3>
<p>[Our Reporter] After the authorities announced the price of ration rice for November in the city at 310 yuan per dan (unit of dry measure), all sectors expressed surprise because the ration price exceeded the market price. It has been learned that the high ration price was actually recommended by the city government. Mayor Wu had previously told reporters that the city government must consider two points when determining the price of ration rice: (1) Based on the experience of the rice rush that occurred in various places during the price control period, it is known that sufficient rice reserves are the basis of security. (2) The relationship between rice prices and the cost of living index, as high rice prices may affect the increase in the cost of living index, which the city government should also pay attention to. In view of the first point above, the city government decided to try to raise the ration price so that rice would not be snapped up all at once, and rice merchants would be motivated to purchase rice from various places, thus making the city's rice reserves sufficient. If the ration price is too low, citizens will rush to buy it, and if it forms an inverted relationship with the producing areas, rice will not come to Shanghai. Therefore, after the announcement of the ration price for this period, Mayor Wu said that the source of rice for the city this month will definitely be smooth, and there will definitely be no rice shortage.</p>
<p>Preventing Increase in Index; Organizing Key Rationing</p>
<p>However, the city government also considered whether setting a high ration price will affect the increase in the cost of living index. For this reason, the authorities decided to implement a key rationing system for public school teachers and journalists. Because the unit of rice quantity in the cost of living index calculation is eight dou, after the implementation of the key rationing system, four dou will definitely be calculated at 230 yuan per dan, so the cost of living index is expected to be unaffected. Mayor Wu also told reporters yesterday that he predicted that the cost of living index this month will be stable. Because there is no fluctuation in rice prices and the prices of various commodities have fallen, although public utilities will be adjusted, the increase is not significant. He also said that the cost of living index will definitely not be falsified. After the index of 8.1 times on the first half of November was announced on the 15th, it once rose to 18.2 times on the 16th. Later, due to the decline in prices, it was 15.4 times when it was released at the end of the month. He also said that the index for this month is likely to fall. He said that the industrial and commercial sectors are extremely difficult, and the cost of living index really cannot rise anymore.</p>

<p>[Our Reporter] The matter of adjusting passenger ticket prices on the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou railways under the jurisdiction of the Beijing-Shanghai Railway Administration was still under study in the Ministry of Communications yesterday.

<p>[Our Reporter] The shipping industry association, due to the request of various companies to readjust passenger and freight rates, had resolved to increase all current freight rates and ticket prices by 45% and submitted it to the Ministry of Communications for approval. It was scheduled to adjust the prices today. According to news from the shipping association yesterday, the Ministry of Communications approved the 45% increase but changed the implementation date to the 6th.

<p>Public utilities will increase prices again. The Shanghai Power Company was the first to submit a request to the Public Utilities Bureau. It is reported that the Public Utilities Bureau is currently calculating the costs of the eight major public utility companies.

It is expected to be announced and implemented around the 10th of this month.</p>

He said that the United Nations Far East Information Office's area of operation includes China, the Philippines, and Siam, and it also has activities in several so-called affiliated territories. Setting up the office in Shanghai is for better coordination of work. In order to strengthen close ties within the area of operation, such work has been planned for a long time and is now being implemented. He himself had planned to go to Bangkok and Manila for inspection three weeks ago, but canceled the trip. Zhu Baoxian, the director of the Shanghai office, has gone instead.</p>

We took the opportunity to visit Ambassador Stuart, and, standing on the people's position, reiterated our hope that the United States would accelerate its aid to China to repel the expansion of communist forces in China. I also explained that Shanghai is a major international city, and the business interests of Britain and the United States are deeply involved. Chinese and foreign residents alike have a need to assist the government in maintaining local order and stabilizing society." The Ambassador seemed to agree and revealed that foreign businesses had no intention of withdrawing easily. "At 4:30 PM, I visited the President, and Chairman Fang and Chairman Zhang Daofan reported on their experiences comforting the front lines in Xuzhou. I also reported on the recent efforts of Shanghai community leaders to launch self-help and national salvation work, preparing to use the power of the people to support the head of state in suppressing the rebellion. I earnestly hope that the central authorities will remain calm and resolute, calling on the people of the whole country to rise up together to defend and save the nation, and achieve the goals of anti-communism, anti-totalitarianism, and anti-aggression." The President believed that people from all walks of life in Shanghai deeply understood the greater good and could express their patriotic spirit through action. He was pleased and said that he would again telegraph community leaders Du Yuesheng, Xu Jiyin, Qian Xinzhi, An Runqing, and Li Fusun to come to Nanjing to listen to their opinions for consideration.</p>
<p>"At 8:00 PM, Chairman Fang and I went to the Air Force Xinsheng Society to hold a grand comfort evening. At that time, there were over a thousand Air Force officers and soldiers present, a gathering of talents, full of spirit. Chairman Fang and I first explained the sincerity of the five million people of the city in expressing their respect and comfort to the flying generals. When the members of the Air Force Comfort Mission arrived in Nanjing by train at 10:00 PM, we presented brocade banners and began the dance party. Because I had important matters to deal with in Shanghai, I took the night train back to Shanghai. From various signs, the government is determined to respect public opinion and make a fresh start with the people. Moreover, the Battle of Bengbu on the front line is solidifying, and yesterday came the good news that the bandit army had begun to retreat north due to being caught in a pincer attack. In addition, with the cooperation of our naval and air forces, it will be even more difficult for the bandit army to cross the Yangtze River, so there is absolutely no problem with security in the Jiangnan region. Some civilians from the capital are flocking to Shanghai by train, and the train station is a bit crowded. Passenger trains are also delayed due to frequent military transport, which is an unavoidable phenomenon in wartime. However, according to my observation, if our compatriots in the rear truly wish to avoid the brutal rule of the communists, they must unite as one, contribute money and effort, and defeat the bandit army. This is the only thorough solution, and escape will not solve the problem. Shanghai is a glorious city of the "January 28th" and "August 13th" anti-Japanese wars. The waterway has a sea outlet that allows international exchanges, and the land route has a large army stationed along the two roads and in the counties along the Yangtze River. In addition, the central government has newly established the Nanjing-Shanghai Garrison Headquarters for unified command. As long as our citizens work together and vigorously promote self-defense training to maintain local order, generously contribute to comfort the soldiers, help wounded officers and soldiers and displaced refugees, and eliminate the barriers between various levels, coordinating labor-management relations with the overall situation as the prerequisite, then we can help ourselves and others. I dare to believe that not only can the area south of the Yangtze River be as solid as a rock, but also the morale of the front-line soldiers will be even more vigorous due to the stability in the rear. The conspiracy of the bandit army, under the direction of foreign races, to enslave the people of the whole country will ultimately fail."</p>

<h3 id="e79">General Situation of Various Universities: Students from Distant Provinces Face Financial Difficulties; Many Request to Leave School and Return Home to Study as Guests; Most Schools Have Not Considered Early Holidays <a href="#e79" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c79" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">79</a></h3>
<p>[Our Report] Due to the turbulent situation, some students from various schools in this city have been requesting leave from school. This reporter made a special visit to the person in charge of each university yesterday. The situations of each school are listed below:</p>
<p>Tongji</p>
<p>The university's administrative meeting decided to accept students' requests. Self-funded students whose families are located inland and who are facing financial difficulties will be allowed to request leave to return to their hometown and study as guests at nearby universities. Credit earned while studying as a guest will be recognized in the future. The school officially announced this information yesterday, and students who urgently need to return home have suspended their studies and left to arrange travel expenses. In addition, the school is facing a food shortage, with only enough supplies to last until the day after tomorrow (the 6th). The school has requested assistance from the People's Mediation Committee, which has agreed to consider the request. According to Dean of Academic Affairs Xia Jianbai, Tongji has approximately 3,000 students, half of whom are self-funded. A portion of the self-funded students are from Sichuan and Hunan. Recently, due to rising prices in this city, remittances from home have been insufficient, leading to financial difficulties. Two weeks ago, they requested that the school allow them to return to their hometown to study as guests at nearby universities, so that family support would be easier and their studies would not be interrupted. The remaining students in the school will continue to attend classes as usual according to the regulations of the Ministry of Education. In addition, Tongji President Ding Wenyuan has requested to resign for the second time due to angina pectoris, but the Ministry of Education has not yet approved his request.</p>
<p>Jiaotong</p>
<p>Student organizations and departments at the university recently signed petitions requesting that the school store three months' worth of food to cope with emergencies. The Student Union held an emergency meeting of department representatives at 6:00 PM yesterday to discuss and decide on several points: (1) Under no circumstances will the school be relocated. Students are called upon not to leave the school. (2) Representatives will be selected by the school's professors, students, and police, and will go to Nanjing together to request that the Ministry of Education advance three months' salary for professors and police, and three months' worth of public funds for students. (3) The school should economize on expenses and find ways to borrow money from the Central Bank to store food. (4) Students will pool their money to purchase and store food, and will implement a power-saving campaign. (5) The school should dig wells on campus. (6) The school's professors, students, and police will jointly establish a contingency organization. According to Zhuo, the person in charge of the school, storing three months' worth of food is feasible in principle, but the Ministry of Education may not have enough funds to allocate. The school is currently studying the matter. A small number of students have requested leave to return home, but the school has decided to continue classes as usual.</p>
<p>Jinan</p>
<p>University President Li Shouyong stated that whether the school will have an early holiday has not yet been decided. The school's food supply can barely be maintained in the short term, but fuel is difficult to obtain and the school's finances cannot bear the burden. Some students have already requested leave to return home.</p>
<p>St. John's</p>
<p>The school is raising funds from students' parents, which is not as good as Lijiang. It is reported that the school is able. May have this semester end early this month</p>
<p>Soochow</p>
<p>University President Yang Yongqing stated that some students have requested leave to return home, but the number is small. Whether to have an early holiday has not yet been discussed. The food issue is being planned step by step.</p>
<p>Fudan</p>
<p>University President Zhang Yi stated: "The school is currently stable."</p>
<h3 id="e80">Deputy Manager of Qichang Bank Accused of Embezzlement: Wei Zhonghuai Denies Collusion in Extortion <a href="#e80" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c80" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">80</a></h3>
<p>[Our Report] Xia Peide, an auditor from the Shanghai Financial Administration of the Ministry of Finance, was dispatched in mid-July to inspect the large borrowers of the Shanghai branch of Qichang Bank and the truth about the bank's overdue exchanges on the 13th of the same month. He allegedly colluded with Wei Zhonghuai, the bank's deputy manager, to forge an inspection report and extorted four gold bars from Zhu Sui under false pretenses. After the Financial Administration discovered this, it reported the case to the Ministry of Finance, which transferred the case to the local prosecutor's office for investigation. During the investigation, Xia Peide fled. Wei Zhonghuai was prosecuted on suspicion of embezzlement. The case was heard in the local court at 3:00 PM yesterday. The defendant, Wei Zhonghuai, and the witness, Qichang Manager Li Zijing, were summoned. Wei Zhonghuai testified: "Xia was dispatched to inspect the accounts on July 15. At noon on the 17th, I and the bank's commissioner, Liu Mingyang, invited Xia to lunch at Xinya. On the evening of the 19th, Xia invited me to his home to talk. Xia said that there were problems with the accounts, which he had already discovered, but had not yet made a report. He then clearly stated that civil servants' salaries were low and their lives were difficult, and he hoped that the bank would provide him with four gold bars, equivalent to one day's income, as a living allowance. I dared not agree and reported Xia's request to Manager Li Zijing the next morning, who immediately rejected it. That evening, I replied to Xia, politely refusing his request. On the morning of the 23rd, I received a letter containing an anonymous extortion note and an inspection report unfavorable to Qichang Bank. I took the report to Manager Li for discussion. Li said that it looked like extortion and intended to report it to the directors and supervisors stationed at the bank. That afternoon, I returned to my home in Suzhou for personal matters. When I returned to Shanghai on the 25th, I learned that Li had reported the matter to the Financial Administration for thorough investigation." The court asked why, if he had already refused Xia's request, he had later sent two letters saying, "My two young children are still studying at university, and each needs four stones of rice to pay tuition next semester. Please help me at that time"? Wei was speechless and did not answer. Witness Li Zijing testified: "After Wei sent me the inspection report sent by the anonymous person, I discussed it with the directors and supervisors stationed at the bank and believed that Xia was suspected of extortion. We reported the matter to the Financial Administration for thorough investigation." He also said that according to his observation, the defendant was only responsible for conveying the message and did not collude with Xia. The court ordered a further investigation by the Financial Administration and adjourned the hearing. The defendant was released on bail with a written guarantee of 50,000 gold yuan.</p>

<p>In the past half month, this newspaper has received letters from readers expressing indignation at the second tuition increase by private primary and secondary schools in this city, or at the "school shop" style of private school authorities, and requesting that the competent authorities ban them; others have expressed sympathy for the difficult lives of primary and secondary school teachers, believing that the situation should be weighed reasonably and a solution should be found quickly. All of these letters have been forwarded by this newspaper to the education authorities for consideration in a rational solution. In recent days, readers' letters have expressed great admiration for the willingness of some private school authorities and teachers to endure hardships rather than increase tuition for students and their families, and have proposed launching a movement to donate money to honor teachers, expressing their sympathy and respect through practical action. This newspaper has always regarded "helping education" as one of its important services. Fundraising for honoring teachers can enable teachers to teach with peace of mind and prevent students' studies from being affected. Therefore, this newspaper is willing to serve readers' requests. From today, this newspaper's social service department will collect donations to honor teachers. We also ask people from all walks of life who are enthusiastic about education to generously donate and enthusiastically support this cause!</p>
<h3 id="e82">Rush to Exchange Gold and Silver Becomes More Severe Day by Day: Branches of the Bank of China, Bank of Communications, and Agricultural Bank to Handle Exchanges Starting Next Week <a href="#e82" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c82" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">82</a></h3>
<p>[Our Report] The deposit exchange business is still limited to the head offices of the four banks of China. The crowding situation is becoming more and more severe day by day. However, according to the person in charge of the Operations Bureau of the Central Bank yesterday, the state-owned banks had already notified the Bank of China, Bank of Communications, and Agricultural Bank of China to quickly order their branches in this city to handle exchange business at the same time. However, due to the cumbersome procedures, there have been delays. After active preparation, starting next week, the branches of the Bank of China, Bank of Communications, and Agricultural Bank of China in this city will start handling exchange business at roughly the same time, which should improve the current crowding situation. Furthermore, it has been rumored that Minister of Finance Xu Cai had gathered the persons in charge of the Operations Bureau of the state-owned banks to discuss improving the exchange method during his recent visit to Shanghai. He also firmly denied this, saying that he had not yet met with Minister Xu after his arrival in Shanghai, and that the exchange business had not changed, and that the original unlimited exchange method was still in place. He hoped that people from all walks of life would not easily believe rumors.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the crowding situation at the entrances of the four banks has become increasingly serious in recent days. Among the crowds of people rushing to exchange money, there are more people in uniform. The lines for exchanging silver dollars are even more intense than the lines for gold. Taking the Central Bank as an example, an average of about 1,500 citizens can be accepted for exchange each day, and those exchanging silver dollars account for about 1,000 of them.</p>

<p>Wang Zaoshi, who was famous in Shanghai before the Anti-Japanese War as one of the "Seven Gentlemen," previously used the name "Jiangxi Ji'an Front Daily" to publish a Shanghai edition. He hired Xu Yiliping as the director of the Shanghai office's preparatory office. Xu worked hard to apply for and obtain four houses, one of which, located at 21 Yuxin Lane, Disixian Road, was designated for Xu and other colleagues from the Front Daily to live in. This summer, Liu Jiufeng, one of the founders of the newspaper, came to Shanghai from Jiangxi. Wang invited him to live on the third floor of the house. Half a month ago, Wang suddenly sold the third floor to a person named Wu Baiqi and wanted to occupy the second floor where Xu lived. Liu and Xu did not agree and Wang forcibly moved in, causing a dispute. Liu and Xu argued that Wang had no right to lend the house to someone who was not related to the Front Daily without authorization and firmly refused to yield. Friends of both sides heard the news and repeatedly mediated the dispute, but it has not been resolved and remains at a standstill.</p>

<p>[Our Report] A tire repair shop at No. 97 near the Central Market on Xizang North Road caught fire at around 4:15 PM yesterday due to carelessness. Because a large number of gasoline barrels were piled next to it, it was immediately affected, and the fire burned intensely and spread to nearby wooden houses and small shops, including Nos. 93, 95, 99, 101, 103, and 105, and also six wooden houses from No. 139 to No. 144 on Market Road, for a total of thirteen wooden houses destroyed.

<p>Results of Yesterday's Chenyou Cup</p>
<p>In the Chenyou Cup basketball tournament, two games were played in Group A. Last night, Chunmao fought hard but was eventually defeated by Jianle. The absence of Chunmao's main players, Liu Fushan and Li Xianzheng, greatly affected the team's strength. The first half was closely contested, ending in a 27-27 tie. In the second half, Chunmao lacked stamina and fell behind, resulting in a final score of 65-48.</p>
<p>The match between Huili and Taikang was a one-sided affair due to the disparity in strength. Huili won by a landslide, defeating Taikang 68-29. In the first half, Huili scored 26 points, while Taikang only scored 8 points. Huili's Tian Fuhai scored 27 points, while Wang Yongfang scored 17 points.

<p>[Our Report] Hu Shandao, 38 years old, from Dinghai, came to Shanghai from his hometown last month to look for business, temporarily staying at the home of his nephew, Hu Qingtang, at No. 37 Guangxing Wharf in Yangshupu. He borrowed a total of 80 yuan and 8 sheng of rice from Qingtang. On the 29th of last month, he was introduced by a friend to work as a sailor on the foreign ship "Glen Hall" at the Hongyinyi Wharf in Pudong. After only four days, his salary had not yet been paid. His nephew, Qingtang, thought that since his uncle had a job, he should quickly return the borrowed money, so he was quite unhappy. He then had a malicious thought: to harm his uncle and seize the sailor's job on the ship. One day in the evening, Qingtang went to the ship in Pudong to meet Shandao, falsely claiming that the cotton quilt had been left at home and could be brought on board to ward off the cold. Shandao did not suspect anything and, after finishing work at 8:00 PM, returned to Shanghai together. When they arrived at a desolate and dark place in Zhoujiawan, Yangshupu, Qingtang took advantage of his uncle's unpreparedness, took out a sharp blade from his sleeve, and slashed at his head six times. Fortunately, he had a felt hat covering his head, and he only suffered three minor cuts. After being injured, Shandao ran away and jumped into the river, calling for help. Zhou Gensheng and Dong Fugen, two guards from the nearby fields, heard the cries and rushed over. They found Hu Shandao hiding in the river and managed to rescue him. Shortly after, the murderer, Hu Qingtang, also arrived in a panic and was apprehended and sent to the Xinshijie Police Station for questioning. The injured Hu Shandao was escorted to the Hudong Hospital for treatment by the investigating officer.</p>

<h3 id="e100">Increased Export Settlement Last Month: Totaling Over US$20 Million <a href="#e100" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c100" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">100</a></h3>
<p>[Our Report] According to sources from the Export Control Commission, the total national export settlement for last month reached US$20,029,000. This figure represents a significant increase compared to the past, largely due to the improved export volume following the implementation of the Foreign Exchange Transfer Certificate.</p>
<p>Export settlement for the first week of November was only US$4,620,000, decreasing to US$2,860,000 in the second week, increasing to US$6,000,000 in the third week, and rising to US$6,500,000 in the fourth week. However, private sector exports saw limited growth, averaging US$1,700,000 in the first two weeks and increasing to US$1,900,000 after the implementation of the Foreign Exchange Transfer Certificate, a marginal increase. Government exports amounted to US$1,900,000 in the first week, US$1,200,000 in the second week, increasing to US$4,130,000 in the third week, and rising to US$4,500,000 in the fourth week. In terms of growth rate, government exports significantly outpaced private sector exports. For the entire month, government export settlements totaled US$12,770,000, accounting for 64% of total exports. Private sector exports amounted to US$7,230,000, accounting for 36% of total exports. Government exports only include cotton yarn, cloth, frozen eggs, mineral sands, and sugar. Exports from the China Trust Bureau and other state-owned companies are not included.</p>
<h3 id="e101">Foreign Exchange Certificates Rise <a href="#e101" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c101" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">101</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the market for Foreign Exchange Transfer Certificates was buoyant. Opening at 29.5 yuan, strong buying interest from importers drove the price straight up, closing firm at a high of 32 yuan. General observation suggests that this was due to positive news stimulating the market, as reported improvements in the war situation. Many importers currently hold import permits, and if positive news continues to emerge from the front lines, market prices may rise again today. Additionally, the Central Bank raised its listed exchange rate for remittances from overseas Chinese to 36 yuan yesterday.</p>
<h3 id="e102">Tight Credit Eases Slightly, Cash Also Becomes More Plentiful <a href="#e102" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c102" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">102</a></h3>
<p>The tight credit situation has eased slightly, with the overnight interest rate in the market dropping to 30 yuan per thousand, equivalent to a monthly interest rate of 0.9 yuan. The issuance of five denominations of new gold yuan notes by the Central Bank has also slightly eased the cash shortage. It is reported that foreign banks have notified their correspondent banks and firms to temporarily settle accounts, making borrowing more difficult and leading to a reduction in credit lines for their customers.</p>
<h3 id="e103">Rice Market Stabilizes After Announcement of Household Rice Prices <a href="#e103" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c103" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">103</a></h3>
<p>Nanshi Market Rice Prices Continue to Fall</p>
<p>Rice prices continue to fall in the Nanshi market, while prices in the Beishi market have stabilized. The announcement of household rice prices, which are lower than market prices, has calmed the public. Prices in the producing areas have firmed up, and with credit loosening, sellers are less willing to sell. Premium japonica and thin indica rice were priced at the same level as the previous day, at 350 yuan. Early rice and indica rice, selling well due to their lower prices, rose by 5 to 10 yuan. In the Nanshi market, the bankruptcy of a major rice merchant led sellers to prefer selling to reliable firms, limiting the number of buyers and causing market nervousness. Prices fell by 30 to 40 yuan in the morning session, recovering slightly at the close but still down by 20 to 30 yuan, with premium japonica trading at 340 yuan. Total arrivals in the North and South markets yesterday amounted to 10,567 shi.</p>
<p>Flour: Market trends have turned upward, opening steadily and then rising as actual sales picked up, with the Zhongshi market seeing gains. Old military flour opened at 107 yuan and closed at 115 yuan, a rise of 7 yuan.</p>
<p>Grains: The situation remains weak, but the decline was not as significant as the previous day. Output of yellow soybeans decreased, and broad beans fell by 5 yuan.</p>
<p>Edible Oil: Prices are stable. Oil mills are opening in large numbers, and trading is brisk. Refined soybean oil is generally priced at 620 yuan, and rapeseed oil at 510 yuan, with a stable trend.</p>
<h3 id="e104">Sugar Market Rises Slightly <a href="#e104" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c104" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">104</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's sugar market softened initially but then stabilized, with prices rising slightly across the board. However, due to market apathy, sellers were reluctant to trade, and scattered retail transactions were limited. Grade 45 refined white sugar opened at 320 yuan, with sporadic small purchases. Market sentiment improved slightly, and prices rose by 20 yuan. With continuous declines in recent days and reduced supply from Taiwan Sugar, buyers showed slightly more interest in medium and coarse sugar, and prices also rose slightly. Local sugar, Zhang Diaoqing, and others had ample supply from merchant groups, and prices were heavily discounted, causing market prices to fall.</p>
<h3 id="e105">Yarn Prices Firm, Cotton Cloth Slightly Improved <a href="#e105" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c105" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">105</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's yarn market saw slightly firmer prices as market sentiment gradually stabilized. 42-count Blue Phoenix fine yarn opened at a high of 1,300 yuan, but as factory supply was ample, the price fell back to close at 10,600 yuan, up 400 yuan from the previous day. Gold City closed at 10,400 yuan, a gain of 400 yuan. 32-count Silver Moon yarn traded at 9,100 yuan, a rise of 300 yuan. 21-count Double Horse yarn rose sharply to 8,700 yuan at one point, before closing at 8,000 yuan, a gain of 1,000 yuan. Other coarse and fine yarns also saw gains ranging from 400 to 1,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Yesterday's cotton cloth market showed slight improvement, with a healthier trend and quieter market conditions. 12-pound Dragon Head fine cloth initially fell, with transactions at 348 yuan, but as buyers showed strong demand, prices rose to 380 yuan before weakening at the afternoon close to 370 yuan, only 5 yuan higher than the previous day. Four Gentlemen Yuan Serge saw brisk trading, rising by 10 yuan to close at 375 yuan. Other Shilin cloth, colored cloth, printed cloth, and white plain cloth remained stable.</p>
<p>Woolens Weaken</p>
<p>The woolens and textile market remained sluggish yesterday. Tailors' sales were slow, clothing business was weak, and the number of buyers was limited. Sellers were eager to clear inventory. Zhanghua floral flannel was quoted by the factory at 240 yuan, payable by five-day check, but instant cash sales were seen at 220 yuan at the tea party, indicating a continued softening trend.</p>
<p>Spot Cotton Continues to Weaken</p>
<p>The spot cotton market has been quiet in recent days. Spinning mills showed no buying interest, and sellers, pressured by tight credit, automatically lowered prices. Hubei fine fleece and Shashi cotton reportedly saw some buying interest from purchasing associations. Zhoupu seed cotton has fallen as low as 190 yuan.</p>

<p>— Our Special Correspondent, Han Qingtao</p>
<p>[Report from Tianjin, 1st] The change of color in Pan Yang was a nightmare, a sudden storm that transformed the world into something different. The loss of Pan Yang was, of course, not accidental. Tracing the roots, we find that the rapid disintegration of five or six elite armies between Shenyang and Heishan was the precursor. The remaining troops defending Shenyang, recognizing the overwhelming odds, subsequently changed course, resulting in a "one-sided" situation.</p>
<p>Initially, the large army trapped in Shenyang launched a multi-pronged attack. Liu Yuzhang led the 52nd Army south, targeting Yingkou, and completed the mission on October 3rd. It is said that there were two purposes: one was to support the westward advance, forming a coordinated front, and the other was to open a retreat route.</p>
<p>The westward advance was commanded by the renowned Liao Yaoxiang, and included three armies known for their elite status: the New 1st, New 3rd, and New 6th, as well as other famous units such as the 49th and 71st. Their mission was to relieve Jinzhou and concentrate in western Liaoning, starting in late October. The advance was slow, and intelligence was poor. Entering Zhangwu and Xinlitun proved to be difficult, ultimately leading to a disastrous standstill in the Heishan, Xinmin, and Xinlitun areas.</p>
<p>The westward advance failed to progress, while the eastward advance could not break through the Tasha Mountain pass leading to Jinzhou. As a result, Jinzhou fell after a fierce battle, and Fan Hanjie, Director of the Northeast Suppression Headquarters Jinzhou Command and Commander-in-Chief of the Ji Re Liao Border Area, along with Zhao Junquan, Commander of the 6th Army Corps, were captured, with incalculable material losses.</p>
<p>The westward advance failed to achieve its mission of relieving Jinzhou. Unable to move westward or retreat to Shenyang, it hesitated and pondered. The enemy, using lightly equipped units, first intercepted the logistics of the various Nationalist armies and made the best use of light cavalry to harass and ambush, confusing and disrupting the Nationalist forces.</p>
<p>Liao Yaoxiang's command post was attacked, and after Liao led his troops to break through, the morale of each army division wavered. Soldiers lacked fighting spirit, officers lacked the ability to maintain discipline, and defeated soldiers fled to Shenyang, further undermining the morale of the entire Pan Yang and its people.</p>
<p>The enemy's main forces gradually arrived in the area west of Xinmin, cutting off a large number of officers and soldiers. A large number of division, regimental, and battalion commanders were captured or killed. Pan Yuqun, Long Tianwu, and others returned to Shenyang in great distress. Long Tianwu even fainted, declaring, "If I can gather a battalion, I will be the battalion commander. If I can gather a division, I will be the division commander, and we will start all over again!" But in reality, this was not possible.</p>
<p>How many troops remained in Shenyang? Two divisions of the 53rd Army, one division of the 207th Division, and the newly formed 2nd Garrison Command of the Shenyang Municipal Government. Using such meager forces to defend the vast urban area of Shenyang, as well as the Beiling, Dongta, and Yunhe airfields, seemed incredibly thin. The military authorities then ordered the 52nd Army from Yingkou in southern Liaoning to return to Shenyang, but unexpectedly, the enemy transferred a force from western Liaoning, intercepting them at Haicheng.</p>
<p>Shenyang lacked reinforcements from the outside and fighting spirit from within. Because the defending forces witnessed the tragedy of the collapse of five or six large armies between Xinmin and Heishan, the impact was too great, leading to wavering morale. The communists seized the opportunity to infiltrate, agitate, and sow discord. As a result, the two divisions of the 53rd Army (the army commander Zhou Fucheng wept bitterly over this, as he was trapped in the encirclement) and others had problems.</p>
<p>On the night of the 28th, enemy forces attacking eastern Shenyang were allowed to enter the more than ten-kilometer-long Tuanshanzi pass. Traces of the Eighth Route Army were found in Dongling and other places. The 207th Division was ordered to rush to restore the position at Tuanshanzi, but due to being held back, it was unable to succeed. At the same time, around Dawa, less than ten kilometers north of Shenyang, the "Eighth Route Army" also attacked, and the Beiling Airfield was the first to be threatened by enemy artillery fire.</p>
<p>Wei Lihuang, Commander-in-Chief of the Northeast Suppression, was hesitant and indecisive in his command and deployment during the Liaoxi Campaign. In the midst of the tension in Shenyang, he panicked and failed to make a planned arrangement. The only hope he pinned on, the 52nd Army, could not return from Yingkou. In the end, everything was reduced to a dream.</p>
<h3 id="e107">Zhenhai Woman Wu Xiangzhu Hangs Herself <a href="#e107" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c107" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">107</a></h3>
<p>[Report from Zhenhai, 2nd] Wu Mengxing, a gentry merchant in Qingshi, Jiasui Township, Zhenhai County, owns over one hundred acres of farmland. However, due to the large number of orphans and close relatives in his clan who rely on his support, he has fallen into even greater financial difficulties this year. Wu himself sent his eldest daughter, Wu Xiangzhu (28 years old, a university graduate), back to his hometown the other day to handle rental matters in order to support his relatives in the countryside. However, for more than a month, no rent was collected, and household expenses were exhausted. Xiangzhu, deeply affected by this, hanged herself in the morning at 3 a.m. on November 30th. The fact that she had land but no rent to collect, leading to this tragedy, is truly lamentable. Furthermore: Since the tragic suicide of Wu Xiangzhu due to the inability to collect rent, over one hundred landlords, large and small (mostly women), dispatched ten representatives to the county government at 9 a.m. on the 2nd to petition for rent collection. The county government's relevant department received them and instructed them to wait for the government to resolve the issue legally.</p>

<p>Hefei</p>
<p>[Our Report] Communist bandits lurking in the Shuanghe, Sanhe area bordering Hefei, Lu'an, and Shucheng, the Huangshan area between Hefei, Chao, and Han counties, and on the surface of Chaohu Lake are now stirring, attempting to disrupt the rear area of central Anhui. The Hefei Garrison Headquarters has dispatched strong teams to suppress them along various routes. Heavy troops are stationed along the Huainan Road, Hepu, Huyu, and Helu highways. Five hundred officials from various provincial government departments and offices assigned to work in 64 counties and cities have set out on their respective routes.</p>

<p>Jingjiang</p>
<p>[Our Report] Recently, the port of Huangtiangang in Jiangyin has prohibited the northward transport of daily necessities, prompting various shops to request reopening. Dai Rongguang, commander of the Jiangyin Fortress, convened a meeting of local government heads on the afternoon of November 30th to discuss appropriate solutions. A joint venture was formed to centrally allocate materials needed by the city.</p>
<p>Yixing</p>
<p>[Our Report] The grain market, which had been suspended for 50 days, officially reopened on November 30th, with positive results. Opening prices were set at 200 yuan for premium japonica rice and 190 yuan for secondary indica rice, with retail sales at 194 yuan, and 180 yuan for japonica paddy and 176 yuan for indica paddy. Despite the low prices, grain merchants lacked cash to cope with the situation.</p>

<p>— Special Translation by the Newspaper Translation Department</p>
<p>Second, he believes that the merged two-stage revolution can be jointly promoted by all progressive classes, except for the imperialist, feudal, and bureaucratic elements within the Kuomintang. This will be "a new type of revolution, completely or partially led by the proletariat. The first stage of the revolution aims to establish a new democratic society, a new political system of joint dictatorship by all revolutionary classes."</p>
<p>Third, Mao advocates temporarily adopting moderate socialism. The economic system of "New Democracy" includes the nationalization of banks, industries, and commercial institutions because these institutions are "large in scale and not suitable for individual operation." Poor peasants without land can still obtain appropriate land from the confiscated estates of large landowners. Other private property and enterprises, if not excessively large, can mostly continue to be held. Therefore, complete socialization is not immediately attempted because "socialism is impossible to implement before the current revolutionary tasks of anti-imperialism and anti-feudalism have been completed."</p>
<p>Fourth, according to Mao's view, this stage of joint dictatorship and moderate socialism will be in complete agreement with Sun Yat-sen's Three Principles of the People. The united political system will adopt a combative approach to implement the Three Principles of the People. Socialism can only go beyond the boundaries of the Three Principles of the People in the second stage of the new revolution, but when this stage will arrive is not indicated.</p>
<p>Fifth, the Chinese people under the new revolutionary system will adhere to a policy of "accepting the hand of friendship from the socialist country of the Soviet Union and the international proletariat."</p>
<p>The Chinese Communist Party (CCP) has already taken practical action regarding the united front of all classes advocated by Mao Zedong. When the CCP convened its Seventh National Congress in Yan'an in early 1945, it demanded that the National Government abandon one-party rule and realize a democratic government, that is, organize a coalition cabinet including representatives from all parties (including the Communist Party). After multiple negotiations with the National Government, efforts to organize a coalition cabinet with the participation of the Communist Party ultimately failed because the Communist Party was unwilling to accept conditions that would hinder its hope of seizing all political power. However, although the political goal of New Democracy could not be achieved, the CCP still preserved the Chinese Communist Party's political方針和宣傳基礎。</p>
<p>Generally, people's explanations of "New Democracy" are roughly as follows:</p>
<p>The CCP has learned many lessons from experience. They have changed their original intentions and are no longer as revolutionary as before. They are striving for reform work as we see it. They are too realistic and unwilling to continue their revolutionary efforts too far from their goals. They talk glibly about revolution, but the revolution they are now pursuing is a slow-paced effort to unite with other progressive elements to promote it through reform.</p>
<p>They are loyal allies of anyone who opposes conservatism and advocates democracy in any "new policy." They are prepared and willing to act in a regulated manner, delaying their revolutionary work to engage in reform work. If we "free people" can get their help to make our reform work truly appropriate, then we may be able to postpone their revolution forever and make our more optimistic hopes for peaceful reform a reality. Secondly, when they use the term "democracy," the meaning they refer to is the same as what we refer to.</p>
<p>Furthermore, communism varies according to the national conditions of each country. The CCP are moderate rural reformers, so even if the above does not apply to the general Communist Party, it can still apply to the Chinese Communist Party. The above is a moderate view of Mao Zedong's "New Democracy" held by some people. Now let's talk about how a well-trained communist party member views Mao's "New Democracy":</p>
<p>Mao discovered a brilliant way to split the opposition. He tries his best to absorb the support of non-communists to help the Communist Party complete its mission, while isolating a small number of extreme anti-communist elements. He makes the most of the opportunists between communism and various progressive reform movements.</p>
<p>He reconciles the old theories advocated by Marx and Engels that the revolution must have two stages, one against feudalism and one against capitalism, with the theory of "permanent revolution" that combines the two revolutions into one. He generalizes Lenin's achievements in merging the two stages of revolution, making it applicable not only to the Soviet Union, but also to China or any other country. In order to merge the two stages of revolution, the concept of uniting all classes must be instilled into the past party theory of one-party dictatorship as the most effective tool for transitioning to complete Communist Party rule.</p>
<p>At the same time, Mao still retains the principle of "proletarian dictatorship" in the revolutionary united front. In this front, the proletariat still occupies the main position until the time when the proletarian dictatorship can be implemented.</p>
<p>When discussing economic policies, Mao drew on the main points of the New Economic Policy adopted by Lenin in 1921. He admitted that in order to develop the country, some private enterprises must be allowed to continue to exist, just as Lenin admitted in 1921. However, he rearranged the order and placed the merger of the New Economic Policy with capitalist development before the socialist revolution and the proletarian dictatorship. At the same time, he advanced the initial stage of collectivization simultaneously with the development of capitalism, making the transition smooth and accelerated.</p>
<p>Mao further advanced Lenin's theory that the Communist Party should participate in non-communist parties. Lenin only said that the Communist Party should not avoid this if it is possible to obtain seats in parliament. Mao further pointed out that the Communist Party's participation in the coalition cabinet does not rely on the strength of votes, but on the sincere cooperation of both parties. This can maximize the Communist Party's power in the government, while minimizing the Communist Party's responsibility to the country.</p>
<p>The Communist Party's view of "New Democracy" has been described above. What is our impression of it? The following views seem worth mentioning:</p>
<p>First, it is the most important communist party work published outside the Soviet Union since the Russian Revolution.</p>
<p>Second, since 1848, no contribution to communist ideology in Communist Party literature has been greater than this.</p>
<p>Third, its deceptive effect is as noteworthy as its orthodox communist ideology.</p>
<p>Fourth, it more clearly shows that communism has no real sympathy for democratic constitutionalism.</p>
<p>Fifth, it thoroughly shows that the Communist Party's economic and political analysis is helpful for the seizure of power, and strengthens the trend of gradually deviating from Marxist theory.</p>
<p>Sixth, it does not emphasize violent revolution, because it has a way to delay the violent revolution until after seizing dictatorial power.</p>
<p>Seventh, it has at least caused a costly mistake in American policy.</p>
<p>Eighth, the era when this theory was most beneficial to the Communist Party has passed, but as long as the Communist Party's hope for world revolution exists, its contribution to communist theory and strategy will continue to maintain its importance.</p>
<h3 id="e110">Second Civil War 甲 Soviet Intervention <a href="#e110" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c110" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">110</a></h3>
<p>The Soviet Union joined the Far Eastern War on August 9, 1945, the day after the United States dropped the atomic bomb on Hiroshima, one week before the end of the war. Soviet troops marched straight into Northeast China and effortlessly occupied the largest coal-producing and industrial region in Asia outside of Siberia and Japan. They also accepted the surrender of the Japanese army in the Northeast.</p>
<p>At that time, it was agreed that the Soviet Union should transfer the administrative power of the Northeast to the National Government army, and it was also agreed that the Soviet Union could restore some of its rights and property in the Far East that had been abandoned in the Russo-Japanese War of 1905 or later. In other words, the Soviet Union could recover the southern part of Sakhalin Island and the railway rights in the Northeast. However, it was not agreed that the weapons surrendered by the Japanese army should not be transferred to the hands of the CCP, nor was it agreed that the Soviet Union should not demand the dismantling of the industrial equipment in the Northeast under the pretext of war booty. As a result, the Soviet Union did both of the above, and it has been occupying Dalian and Lushun until now.</p>
<p>On August 14, 1945, the Soviet Union and China signed a 30-year Treaty of Friendship, and the articles were announced on August 26, the day Mao Zedong arrived in Chongqing to discuss unification issues with Chairman Chiang. This revealed a glimmer of "peace."</p>
<p>The National Army and the Communist Army began to compete for the weapons, land, and industries surrendered by the Japanese army in North China. This competition on the Communist Party's side went far against the order issued by the Supreme Commander of the Allied Forces, MacArthur, that all Japanese surrenders should be accepted by the central government authorities.</p>
<p>For decades, Dalian Port and the South Manchuria Railway have always been the main passages between mainland China and the Northeast. After the Chinese government was rejected from "jointly using" Dalian Port, all troop movements had to take a roundabout and difficult land route through Shanhaiguan or use unsuitable auxiliary seaports. When the Japanese army surrendered, almost all of the National Government's troops were in the southwest. The National Army's movement to the Northeast was first hindered by the destruction of the railway south of the Yangtze River by the Japanese army. In addition, after the Japanese surrender, the Communist Army destroyed many railway lines north of the Yangtze River. Because of this initial situation and the actions of the CCP and the Soviet Union, the time for the National Army to reach the Northeast was delayed.</p>
<p>On November 2, the Soviet Union announced that it would begin to withdraw its troops from the Northeast, and the Chinese government was not yet prepared to follow up and move in. The National Army, which moved into the Northeast by sea, discovered that the Communist Army had occupied important strongholds. Other troops marching by land had to compete for Shanhaiguan, an important stronghold on the railway line from mainland China to outside the customs. As a result, the second civil war between the Nationalists and the Communists quickly broke out again. In November 1945, battles occurred widely wherever the two armies came into contact.</p>
<p>The war progressed in a complex and tragic manner. The CCP was no longer weak. The National Army dimly recovered Yan'an and occupied several key cities and railway lines, but as the Communist Army lost one area, it quickly captured another.</p>
<p>The way the war was conducted was very interesting, but this is not our concern here. The question is: How did Soviet intervention in the Far East affect the balance of power of the Chinese army? Although the answer cannot be accurate, it may be very simple. Before the end of World War II, the strength of the Chinese Red Army was about 500,000 people, and their weapons were not very sufficient. Now their strength is three times what it was before, and their weapons are more than abundant.</p>
<p>The CCP obtained the Japanese army's weapons and other materials not through open or formal transfers, but through secret private transactions. Therefore, although they did not completely control the Northeast, they had already paralyzed it. They occupied the industrial assets of the Northeast, which, although only remnants, were far better than any assets they had previously acquired. They did not make full use of the industries there, but the areas under the jurisdiction of the National Government, which urgently needed these industries, could not get their hands on them at all.</p>
<p>The Chinese civil war has now broken out again, but the situation is completely different from when the civil war ended. The balance of power between the Nationalists and the Communists has changed drastically. In 1937, the CCP's victory was to fight for survival. Now, it may be the Kuomintang's victory. Soviet intervention in the Far East was the biggest factor in this change. (To be continued)</p>
