<h3>翁文灝列席立法院會議　坦白說明財經局勢　控制游資整理市場以解決物價問題　將開放自備外匯輪入物資</h3>
<p>〔本報南京十八日電〕立院子八日晨九時半起舉行檢討物價秘密會議，出席委員四百餘人，院長孫科因事請假由陳副院長立夫主席，行政院長翁文灝，財長王雲五，社會部長谷正綱，糧長關吉玉，工商部長陳啓天，財次徐柏園等均列席，盲由翁院長對金圓券發行迄今財經情勢作殮討性之報告，渠說明自八一九至九月底，金銀外幣之收兌，出口收入，僑匯兌款及央行收進外幣存款餘萬元，目前仍繼續增加中。至共匪及不肖投機份子在華北·華南各地違法交易，造成金鈔墨市一節，政府已嚴密注意，並卽將採取有力措施，予以打擊。關於金融市塲利息及匯水，已切實抑低，此一成功，使國家行局收八存款增加三倍，商業行莊收八存款增加七倍，總數較八一九以前增加金圓券一億八千餘萬元。關於物價問題，翁氏坦白承認，政府擬定金圓及美金兌換率時，未曾顧及，西南各地黑市遠低於京。滬，以至兌換率之忽然提高，影響物價，而蓉。昆等地之鎳幣風潮，亦為使各該地區人心不定，物價暴漲之惡因。再者，八一九以後，金銀外幣之收兌，佔金圓發行額三分之二，此大量游資充斥，市堪造成槍購風氣，物價遂卽高漲。翁氏並稱：物價凍結，未能澈底，亦為一大失誤。至於生產事業之情况，今日事實竟不幸與原先估計相反，其原因尤為複雜。八一九凍結物價時，原料價格適已上漲，而成品價格未及調整，廠商製造成品後，售價不及成本，生產乃由是停頓。此外，運費凍結，燃料已漲，致貨運不暢，國家行局及私人行莊放款不多，生產事業流動資金不足，以及軍事局勢之彬響，均使生產事業萎縮。翁氏報告時，詞情懇切，於坦白說明目前財經局勢之實况後，復提出政府對富前物價間題將自控制游資及整理市塲兩事八手解決，關於控制游資，政府所採之措施，已漸見成效，如發行短期庫券，已達一億金圓，出售國營事業股票，已售出六百萬金圓，督促商業行莊增資，可達一億金團，今後擬更加速出售敵偽產業，並次第籌備發行正當生產事業之公司價券，開放外匯存款之支用，至國營事業股票將採保息辦法，並以改組董事會，招待新股東參觀等方式，增强信用。此外，對生產事業資金之流動及原料成品之運輸，亦將盡量予以便利。關於整理布塲，政府決以全力取締囤積居奇，疏導物資來源，並依公平原則，合理限價，促使商業歸於正常穩定。</p>
<h3>幷郊戰事重心　移至山岳地帶　城東南東北之綫澈夜砲聲</h3>
<p>〔本報西安十八日電〕太原外圍戰鬥頗烈，匪軍不斷增援，數度猛犯，　　甫郊之坪頭，石咀，前後李村，昨晚戰事尤烈，由石莊西竄之匪一個縱隊及砲兵團，刻已越榆次北上。</p>
<p>〔中央社太原千八日電〕并頃城郊戰事重心移至城東南迄東北之山岳地帶，城東南約二十餘華里之黑駝棗園，麻地溝，高崖底，界花　，城東北十五華里瓜地溝離城廿餘華里之榆林坪等據點，十七晚激戰澈夜，砲聲隆隆，城內淸晰可聞。進犯黑駝棗圖之匪四十四，三十八兩旅，經國軍痛擊，傷亡慘重，迄十　晨，攻勢頓挫，犯偷林坪之匪第四，野三兩旅，在砲火掩護下冒死向國軍陣地更番衝擊，均被擊退，瓜地溝，麻地溝導處國軍刻仍輿匪激戰中。又，國軍於反午在步砲密切聯合下，向城實南二十餘華里之南坪頭附近之匪展開掃蕩，匪　驗頑抗，經團軍熾盛火力猛擊，空軍亦臨空助戰，匪工事大部被燬，死傷六百餘名。</p>
<h3>宋子文由港返穗</h3>
<p>〔本報廣州十八日電〕宋子文主席於十八日下午二時由港專機返抵此間，同行有　央行經理丁世祺，交行經理黃光等。</p>
<h3>王雲五報告</h3>
<p>翁院長報告畢，王財長復作補充說明，渠據統計資料分析分一九前後物價之變動，並舉米·煤·紗布之價格實例，指出幣制改革後各地物價漲跌不一，而最近之波動，實由於共匪之擾亂，軍事局勢之變化，物價運供之阻滯及社會心理不安定等人為因素。渠稱：政府正積極進行之平抑物價辦法，計分五項，（一）增加生產，二千萬元美金之工業原料，卽將輸八，並將設法消除廠商疑慮，積極增產。（二）節約消費決採取措施，澈底實行節約。（三）疏導物資，將開放自備外匯輸入物資，並嚴令各地方政府駐軍，不得妨害物資流通，（四）控制游資，（五）合理限價，絕對取締囤積。至十一時開始由各委員質詢，午前發言及提出書面質詢者六人，多盼政府貫澈法令，以取信人民，並嚴格認眞取締各種黑市，以防共匪乘機搗亂，至午散會。下午三時許繼續開會，發言及提出書面質詢者，續有十餘人，均力主政府應穩定幣制，取締金鈔黑市，加緊大量生產，實行全面配給，至五時四十分尚有未及發言者，未及宣讀其書面意見者廿餘人，然以時間迫促，經主席徵得各委員同意，停止發言，請翁院長及王財長答覆，翁氏扼要答覆數項質詢後，並重申政府維護金圓券之決心，請各委員轉告社會各界，勿輕信謠言，動搖信心，並望各委員對各部門負責執行人員隨時督促，政府對各委負寶貴意見，願虛心接受。王財長首稱：「金債券之凖備金日有增加，且按月公開其發行，目前發行額距最高發行額極遠，決不能謂已達膨脹程度」。王氏並解釋七·八·九三個月稅收不多之原因謂，七·八兩月份所收稅款，係以法幣計算，且照舊稅率徵收，故七·八·九三個月為數甚少，但今後三個月收八數字必然可以增加，收支決可漸趨平衡。國外外匯資產登記，各地均在發動推進，且有有力僑商決心率先領導，前途樂觀。關於行莊增資，決不展期，至物價調整問題，王氏稱：「何時為物價調整之最適當時期，政府尚須縝密考慮，現尚未至決定時期」。至六時一刻宣告散會。</p>

<p>〔美國新聞處本市訊〕美援運用委員會與經濟合作縱署十八日所發表關於工業配件與復興計劃之佈告，引起贈予及貸予之不同問題。</p>
<p>一切配件計劃，均由贈予項下資助。實際上所謂贈予，乃中國政府無須償選之一種美元貸款。</p>
<p>復興計劃則由貸予項下資助，貸予亦為一種對中國政府之外匯貸款，但中國政府須負責償還與美國。</p>
<p>經濟援華名下所撥之二億七千五百萬美元，其中僅三千五百萬美元列入貸予項下。</p>
<p>無論贈予或貸予之援助，美國對華所提供之外匯，將使中國能輸八國內復興所必需而非美援不能獲得之物資與配備。</p>

<p>白宮新聞秘書羅斯談稱，杜魯門對該計劃迄今之結果甚表「欣慰」，並樂於聞悉此款亦運用於華北之經合署計劃。按援華之舉已成為競選中一項大問題，共和黨主張應對此一戰時盟國予以更多經濟援助，作為世界性阻遏共產主義運動之一部份。杜威曾於上週內談稱，共和黨政府將終止「吾人對舊盟國及老友之漠視」</p>

<p>社論</p>
<h3>看吉田內閣的本質</h3>
<p>日本的政治，經過一陣暴風雨後，又恢復平靜了。繼蘆田而來的吉田內閣，閣僚的任命式將於今天完成，吉田茂率領一羣「新人」粉墨登塲，他們在盟國重視之下開步走了。看內閣陣容，好似一黨內閣；看吉田在內閣的比重，好似政黨獨裁者；看他態度的矜持，說話的頑固，乃至看民主自由黨的政綱政策，我們毫無保留的認為：吉田內閣是一個極端保守的內閣，並且是戰後六屆內閣中最具有濃原保守性格的內閣。</p>
<p>日本輿論界預料吉田內閣將為短命內閣，外界批評吉田是一極端保守而右傾的八物，政治生命是短暫的。照這樣看來，日本政治的暴風雨，似乎並沒有吹過，它將間歇而來，於不久之後仍要吹倒吉田的。其實這個觀察並不盡然；吉田內閣可能平穩的站件，苟延到一個相當長的時間。</p>
<p>判　政黨政治的生命和一個政府的生命，不能以保守或進步的性格來評價，尤不能以時間的久暫來銓衡，應該從國際政治和背景關係去估量，方是比較正確的。今天的日本政治，左的道路走不通，左傾政黨也缺乏力量，於是右傾的保守的力量應運而生。左與右不能相等，中間道路的寬度太大，所以「中這政治」在左右之間又站立不住，乃是必然的情勢。蘆田內閣之倒，說明日本中道政治之倒，同時也說明日本政黨的背景，沒有這個「中間」階級的存在。吉田的民主自由黨及其本屆內閣，它的政治性格和階級背景，是比較顯著的：</p>
<p>第一，民自黨主張絕對自由的資本主義，反對社會主義和所謂修正資本主義，深為日本資本家財閥所支持。本月十四日眾院投票選任吉田為首相的消息傳出後，東京股票市塲一致上揚，足徵金融市塲是歡迎吉田內閣的。</p>
<p>第二，吉田代表一個舊日本體系，他以宮廷地主為支柱，民自黨的核心人物，多出身財閥地主，或依附資本主義而生存的人。吉田本身雖為官僚，但不喜歡官僚或職業政治家，民自黨的選舉費，不需要敲詐或貪汚，它有財閥地主的開支，財閥地主的財源，靠剝削和利潤　政權祇是保護它的剝削和利潤，所以不靠政權貪汚。吉田內閣選了一批新人，卽是物色一批資本家地主代表的登台，所以他能大膽挺胸的說：內閣人事的銓衡，是以優秀幹練及廉潔為條件的。這是吉田內閣與蘆田內閣政治性格的不問，階紙背景的不同。至於吉田內閣是否卽為短命內閣，日後要看內閣的措施了。</p>
<p>吉田以代表舊日本典型而出塲，他以財閥地主利益的保護者而施政。其政策偏於舊日本之復活，對財閥地主利益予以保護，殆無疑義。現在特別議會正在進行中，吉田內閣的最大措施，是設法通過「國家公務員法」的修正案，並可能假借盟總的壓力，鎭壓社會黨的「勞動攻勢」。議會任務完成後，是否需要解散進行總選，在吉田看來是不重要的。今天的日本，保守的右傾的力量普遍抬頭，總選的勝利可能囑於民自黨，在吉田是有相當把握的。他如政治上傾向保守，神化天皇，經濟上對內重壓工潮，對外進行東亞經濟共榮，並以和會勝利為中心任務，都可能獲得相當支持的。吉田雖較片山蘆田頑固，可是他比片山蘆田善於施政，藉以博得舊日本人民的歡心。吉田此次受命組閣時，曾兩度晋謁麥帥，要求門總人員勿要干涉日本政治與人事；這說明吉田對於舊日本的復活，是充分具有信心的。吉田內閣沒有民主，缺乏進步，這是必然的。它的出塲，是把日本政治帶向保守的道路上去，一切均將逐漸恢復舊觀！</p>
<h3>聯合國關稅貿易　總協定業經修改　新加入國正與會員國進行談判</h3>
<p>朱返談偰京話</p>
<p>〔本報南京十八日電〕我國出席日內瓦聯合國關稅貿易會議代表朱楔，已於日前返國。據朱氏十八日談：本屆會議共分兩次開會，一為關稅貿易總協定締約國會議，一為國際貿易組織過渡委員會第二屆會議。關於前者，計通過二要案：（一）新參加協定之挪威·丹麥·巴基斯坦等十三國，皆應按照總協定規定辦法，與各會員國互相舉行關稅談判，並互相减讓，成立　邊協定，並預定明年四月一日在日內瓦舉行關稅談判；（二）修改關稅貿易總協定，以國際貿易憲章中有關條文代替關稅貿易總協定條文第三，第六，第十三，十五，及廿六條；（三）允許西德英美佔領區適用總協定。美國原意本擬將西德與日本同時提出，並要求無條件享受各國關稅减讓待遇，嗣經中。英與印度荷蘭等國反對，乃未將日本提出，但西總協定為一單獨協定，與關稅總協定無關，惟我國代表未簽字，以避免將來日本援例。至於國際貿易組織過渡執行委會第二屆會議，所通過者多係內部各種規程及國際貿易之組織事項。該二會議共歷時六週，日前各新加八總協定之國家已開始與各會員進行關稅談判。</p>

<h3>國際有效管制未建立前　美決不毀棄原子彈　奧斯灑對蘇建議提出答覆</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕巴黎十八日廣播：美代表奧斯汀十八日在聯大政委會中論及原子能時，警告蘇聯謂共產國家一日閉關自守於鐵幕後之秘密世界中，美國卽一日不願放棄原子彈，問時整個西方世界亦將不斷重整軍備。奧氏指責蘇聯建議同降毀滅美國儲備的原子彈，並設置國際管制原子能機構，乃係一種「策略」而已。</p>
<p>其用意無非欲在世人確知蘇聯是否擁有此種武器以前，毀滅美國原子彈。奧氏謂美國無意放棄其原子武器，除非建立一種充分有效之管制機構，足以保證他國並無且不能取得此種武器。蘇代表馬里克答　奧斯汀，仍以蘇聯已作重大讓步之老生常談反覆陳一述，渠譴實英美兩國對蘇聯之原子能建議相約保守緘默。馬氏末稱：「奧斯汀侈談關閉門戶及鐵幕，不能說明蘇聯之計劃為不可接受」。渠謂美國原子計剷並無國際管制之意，「僅為不受管制之所有及管理，以及美國龍斷原子能之生產與開發而已」。奧斯汀復繼績攻擊蘇聯之嚴守秘密，並警告稱：如蘇聯拒絕參加世界組織共同合作，卽無安全可言。此種情形存在一日，世人卽一日懷疑蘇聯之動機而有武裝防備之必要。共產國家欲生存於秘密世界中，難免有備戰之行為，吾人則不欲生存於此種世界中，此卽聯合國原子能委會所遭遇之困難局面也云。</p>

<h3>美大選前奏曲之六　雜談美大選規章　杜威必勝無疑</h3>
<p>— 本報特派員毛樹淸</p>
<p>〔紐約航訊〕美國大選在十多天後就要舉行，紐約的「馬票」，賣到十六對一。所謂馬票，指若千俱樂部倡辦的總統預測獎券，如果你放一塊錢，預測杜魯門當選，萬一杜魯門果眞勝利了，你可以贏進十大塊錢。反過來，如果你放一塊錢，預測杜威勝利，假如杜威勝利了，你祇能贏一塊錢的十六份之一。聽說，這幾天，費城還祇到八對一，芝加哥大概五對一光景，最妙的是杜魯門的家鄉—米蘇里，也已經到了四對一。</p>
<p>勝負的大局，大槪已輕分明了，關鍵是選舉結果，將會到怎樣一個比例？有人說，今年全國「個人選票」的結果，杜威必然是壓倒優勢，甚至會超過其他所有候選人加起來的「總和」。也有人說，社威這次當選，將和一九三二年羅斯福壓倒胡佛那樣的優勢。用中國成語來表達，呌做「水到渠成」，也可以說是「眾望所歸」。大概，杜威勝利，是不曾再有問題的了。</p>
<p>前幾天，為採訪世界貨幣基金，與世界銀行第三屆年會，去了一趙華盛頓，間接聽白宮傳來的秘聞，說杜魯門已經患了神經病，飲食起居的日常生活，己經跟經常有了異樣。這位澤身帶有米蘇里農家氣味的杜魯門總統，大概有七分知道他「非失敗不可」的命運了，他是那樣手忙脚亂的着急。在中西部競選，破口大罵共和黨，比「村婦」的口氣還潑，回到華盛頓，又忽然提出派「文生」出使莫斯科，氣得馬歇爾毛髮倒豎。華盛頓的報紙，挖苦杜魯門，眞是無微不至。有一張報紙說：「柏林危機快要弄翻了，時局嚴重到這步田地，而我們的大總統，忽然這麼長時間跑去旅行競選去了，他還在悠哉遊哉地抱著鄉下孩子接吻呢」！</p>
<p>但是，據杜魯門週圍的人說，他老人家「硬是」想當選連任，大槪，做官有癮，做一國之尊的總統，更有一種說不出的「妙處」，然而，在另一種心境下，他知道能力不如杜威，農望不如杜威，行政經驗不如社威。最近，杜魯門到了一次費城，在費城「獨立堂」的來賓簽名簿上，他寫了白宮通訊處，然後又加了括號，註明「臨時的」。他的自知之明，和他的「　棧」慾念，是永遠水火的，這也許便是「神經失常」的眞正原因。</p>
<p>民主黨在白宮，盤據了十六年，杜魯門總算唱了一齣壓軸戲。聽美國的政治學家說，一個政黨連續執政過久，必然會引起黨的本身的分裂，結果是人才自相抵銷，最後必然在競選塲中失敗。如果這一種假說，是民主常軌的必然現象，那末，華萊土和南方死硬派的分道游離，是今年十一月民主黨失敗的先聲。今天，許多有見識的美國人，都認為民主黨拿不出一副像樣的「班底」，杜魯門的副總統候選人是一個七十多歲的老頭子，其他，便沒有一個敲得饗的人物。而共和黨道邊，人才有的是，陣容够是整齊，而杜威自己更是口口聲聲講「統一團結」。一九四八年的美國共和黨，硬是有那麼一副統一團結的陣容，遭是杜魯門無法克服的難關。</p>
<p>選舉的日期是十一月二日，根據美國的憲章成例，每四年一次的大選，在十一月的第一個「星期一」以後的『星期二』。今年十一月的第一個星期一，是十一月一日，因此，大選在二日，和總統副總統同時選舉的，還有三分之一的參議員（卽上議員），還有全部的眾議員。上議院議員九十六名，今年改選卅二名，眾議院全部議員四百卅五名，此外，今年還要改選卅二個州長，州參議員·法官·陪審官等等，都是在同一天一個選舉票上選舉的。因此，各黨各派為競爭選舉忙，不但忙的是總統，還有更寶際的參議員和眾議員。</p>
<p>一九四六年的參眾兩院選舉，共和黨獲了全勝，今年的情形，精有兩樣。大槪，眾議院方面，共和黨的把握較大，參議院方面，民主黨可能轉變為優勢。抗戰時期在重慶住得很久的赫爾利大使，今年在積極競　聲新墨西哥州的聯幫參議員，（上議員每州僅兩人），據說並沒有多大把握，因為赫爾利的對方，是前任農業部長安特遜，安特遜也是新墨西哥州人，有地位的民主黨黨員，赫爾利則屬共和黨。</p>
<p>各州參眾兩院議員的名額，和總統選舉也是有關聯的，這是因為美國「成文憲法」硬性規定的緣故。美國是一個聯邦制的合眾國，因此，按理論講，各州的公民祇能選舉各州「總統選舉人」，然後由各州的「選舉」，再來選舉聯邦的總統。這個制度確立於美國建國之始——一七八七年，一直到現在還沒有廢止。</p>
<p>政黨政治勃興以後，人民直接選舉總統，似乎比間接選舉還方便。因此，到一八〇八年，美國各黨一致同意：各州的「總統選舉人」依黨藉分成組集，共同當選或落選。響如，紐約州按憲法，有四十七名「總統選舉人」，民主黨提四十七個名，共和黨也提四十七個名，如果紐約州的人民，大多數投票給杜威，意思卽是說，共和黨的四十七個「總統選舉人」，已經被人民選出。然後各州選出的「總統選舉人」在十二月中間的某一天，（規定十二月間的第二個「星期三」以後的「星期一」），投票給聯幫政府，正式選出聯邦的總統副總統。這步手續原是笨絀而多餘的，但因為是憲法傳統，也一直沒有修政。</p>
<p>各州的「總統選舉人」的名額，相一當於各州參眾兩院名額的總和，例如，紐約州有兩名參議員，四十五名眾議員，「總統選舉人」便有四十七個。密歇根州有兩名參議員，十七名眾議員，所以，他可以產生十九名「總統選舉人」，納伐達州有兩名參議員，一名眾議員，所以，納伐達可以產生三名「總統選舉人」。全美國一共九十六名參議員，四百卅五名眾議員，所以，全美國總共有五百卅一名「總統選舉人」，</p>
<p>總統副總統當選，要有過半數的「總統選舉人」的選票，（二百六十六票），因此，在競選塲合中，控制大州，忽略小州，是一個必需的運用。一九四四年，杜威和羅斯福競選，在全民投票的總和當中，　斯福繼得了百分之五十五，杜威百分之四十五。但是，在「總統選舉人」的選票當中，羅斯福却獨得了百分之八十四，前一種比數，不過表示羣家的擁戴程度，後一種比數，却代表法定的紀錄。羅斯福是一個對於競選門檻最精通的人，如今羅斯福早已長眠九泉了，羅斯羅當年的競選勁敵，今天却雄立在民主黨的對面。（十月十二日於紐約上城）</p>

<h3>飯菜供應　份量減少　食客大都不能果腹　菜館業請疏導來源</h3>

<p>〔本報訊〕十五日甫告應市之珠寶獎券，中信局局及各代銷機構竟已銷售一空。市區雖仍有若干家獎券號，有少額應市，惟門前亦出現擠購行列。搶購者情緒之熱烈，與擠購米油等日用品初無二致。該項獎券，總額不過六十萬張，且須應付全國各地銷售，上海一地僅攤到二三十萬張。而每券僅售五角，聞不乏有人大批吸進，更傳業已產生黑市，索價至少超過票面一借。中信局中儲會當局，對獎券如此暢銷，咸表出乎意料。原定每兩個月發行一期，茲者第一期發行不二日卽告全部銷售一空，故原定十二月十日開獎之期，已考慮呈請財部予以提早。第一期獎品共值十二萬元，該批珠寶獎品，中信局在本年二月間，早已聘請專家估定底價，此次為發行獎券，曾於改革幣制後，又聘本市珠寶專家重加複估，照當時時值估定，至今又隔一月有餘，一般估計，該項獎品時值當與日俱增，故搶購者興趣倍增。記者昨復向中儲會探詢發行該項獎券情形，據悉：根據財部規定，代售獎券機構，共分特約及當然兩種，當然者係指國家行局，其分銷情形如次：中儲會五萬九千張，中信局三萬五千張，中國二萬五千張，郵匯局一萬張，交通五千張，特約者由係有經騐行家承包全國各區銷路共計五家，計京滬杭區由實樂行承包，共二十四萬張，川黔湘鄂區由大道實業公司承包，共六萬五千張，平津區由晋華公司承包，共二萬張，陝甘靑區由陳柏年承包，計四萬張，安徽區由信業公司承包，計一萬張。此外本市珠寶業公會，亦承包五萬張。</p>

<h3>汽油餘額有限　僅敷六百輛用　汽車節約會今開會　重加審核配油標準</h3>
<p>本市汽車汽油節約審議會，定今日下午三時，在市府舉行審核小組會議。據悉：此次會議，對不合私人汽車限制辦法規定之身份，而祇能獲得十介侖之基本配油者，其申請加配汽油一節，卽重加審核，並決定應予加配汽油車輛之標準。惟據該會負責人透露：本市本月份所獲配油，除工業用油及特種配油外，（如警備車·救火車·救護車等），所餘汽油，只敷供應六百輛汽車，（照規定油量每輛五十介侖計），而業經核定合乎中央規定施用汽車身份之醫師，已有二百七十輛，再加各機關首長用車配油，餘額已極有限，現申請加配汽油者，已在千餘人以上，故市府對於配油標準，將絕對嚴格規定，卽參議員，國大代表，立法委員車輛配油，恐亦不可能予以加配云。</p>

<h3>資金外流銀根轉緊　市場利率繼續上升　資金南逃又趨嚴重　當局攷慮遏阻辦法</h3>
<p>昨日銀根仍見帶緊，市塲利率，翔至月息九分，以迄一角五分，長期拆款，竟有高建三角以上者。乃為改帶以來所僅見。現鈔恐慌，與日俱增。聞月前市面拆款，現鈔利率，較票據頭寸為高。而日來本市票據交換轉冗，可見一斑。又息：五十元及一百元之大鈔，又有貼水發生，航帮求之甚亟。　銀錢行莊，日來由於銀根感緊，再無隔夜頭寸存放中央銀行，按照規定，次日不得領現，故連日業內銀根極緊。對於客戶提支，限額極嚴。大行莊每戶僅派領一千元或二千元，小行莊僅派領五百元，甚至二百元云。</p>
<p>〔聯合徵信所訊〕資金南流與資金逃港，近又險象環生，財部及廣州經管當局雖迭次設法加以遏止，其勢尚未稍殺。政府將有緊急措施，予以嚴區之打擊。目前匯款南流之資金，不外匯款與運現兩種方式。目前匯款已能控制，每日所到匯款，付款行莊，支付匯款，總數以二十萬元為限。運現方面，飛機與輪船，亦加緊檢查。但目前所感困難者，若干匯款，紛紛由廣州附近各縣轉匯。至運現粵漢路方而，亦不易澈底檢查。故政府現針對此點採取有効措施，決予限制。據悉：資金南流以後，多在廣州搶購物資，買進外幣黃金，外匯黑市大受影響。</p>
<p>〔又訊〕據金融當局人士昨晨表示，邇來資命南逃香港問題，復見嚴重，經濟管制督導員辦公處雖已嚴令偵查阻遇。惟是項現象並未根絕，聞政府當局為澈底根絕是項情形起見，正考慮與港政府再度磋商。希望港方本中港協定精神，對國內資金逃港之阻退予以協助。</p>

<h3>絲綢冷落</h3>
<p>人絲市況依然呆頓，塲內已無交易。公會配售數量仍微，申購者仍感不敷應用，絲號門銷去化仍吒，走勢續堅，惟因數量限制，大多無貨出售。生絲交易仍未做開，執戶觀望，市上有求無供。</p>

<h3>華茶外銷寂寞</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕茲據華茶出口權威方而透露消息：目前菲洲對於屯綠等雖頗青睞，但終因彼地茶商，自彼主管處最近分配之外匯，業已用罄，而須俟下次重行配售後，始能展開胃納。故邇來華茶外銷，漸形遜色，過程轉趨寂寞。惟持者則在產存兩稀中，熊度咸抱穩健，潛墊遂仍倘秀。至於祁門紅茶，英倫尚有進意，惜　抑價，致出口亦屬式微。餘如內銷茶，津帮猶受運輸關係續乏動靜。然太街與蘇錫常一帶各有去化，市氣均稱穩固。</p>

<h3>北平師大恢復原制係依據大學法規定</h3>
<p>敎部發言人談核准經過</p>
<p>〔本報南京十八日電〕敎部發言人談：國立北平師大，於抗戰初遷西安，與其他院校合併成立西安臨大，繼再改組。勝利後因廿八年確定之師範學院制度，改稱為北平師院。改院後該校校友迭次請求恢復大學，本部一向甚重視其歷史與傳統，故年來亦曾歷次考慮，如何恢復方符法制。欲以師範改稱大學，則除與師範敎育有關之文理兩學院外，其他學院因性質不同無法加八，則不能依法有三院。（敎育學院早因師範制度而廢止）若改為普通大學，則與該院傳統不符，失其意義。近因大學法頒布，依據新法之第四條，有本法施行前已設立敎育學院得繼續辦理之規定，而北平師院之敎育學部事實上為舊北師大敎育學院之後身，依法自可恢復原名，繼續辦理。而師範學院之課程，本為大學文理兩院所有者，卽以分設文理兩院，自無不合，再加舊有之敎育學院，則其有三院之規模，合乎大學法大學具有三院之規定，非其他師院所可比，自可恢復其大學名稱。兩年來本部對此問題一再縝密考慮，而於最近始能得此法制依據，呈准恢復，亦非易易。</p>

<h3>奉公守法的人</h3>
<p>— 雷霆</p>
<p>偶然在報上看到兩條絕對不同而又有點相同的消息，出事的地點均在日本，因此也可作為戰後日本的社會相看。</p>
<p>第一則是守法的，結果是活生生地餓死：</p>
<p>「東京地方法院推事出口良忠，因嚴萬遵守糧食統制法，竟餓死。遺書有云：雖說是壞的法律，但終是法律；故敢與黑市搏門而餓死！」</p>
<p>另一則是犯法的，結果是被法院判處死刑：</p>
<p>「福岡縣人伊藤孝助，十七歲，向過流浪生活，近以殺死兩老婦人並刦其金飾罪，被名古屋法院判處死刑。」</p>
<p>「殺人者死」，古今中外的法律都差不多一樣，所以伊藤孝助判處死刑，原為情理之常。不過成為問題的是：被判死刑的只是一個未成年的十七歲的孩子，而且一向又過的是流浪生活，因而便引了兩派不同的意見。這，因為我並非法律家，只好不談。但最令人尋味的，却是「守法者死」這前一個絕對不合邏輯的事實。然而這又是確擊的事實！</p>
<p>如果貿然提出「守法者死」的口號，自不免被人目為白痴甚至是喪心病狂，因為古今中外當然不會有這一條法律的規定。但現在部確有一位因「守法」而致死的推事，雖說發生的地點是戰敗的日本。而日本這一事件的所以傳播開來，大約又是死的不是一個平民而是推事，所以比較的引人注意。其實宇宙茫茫，被人忽略了的因「守法」而「致死」者，眞不知有多少！</p>
<p>不久以前，我們曾聽過「有條有理」的新註釋。這不是幽默而是慘捕的呼號。「有金條的才有理由」。反過來說，沒金條便沒理由。理由的是否充足旣和金條成正比例，試問眞正奉公守法的有幾個人有金條？因而我的第一個結論是：守法的沒有金條。</p>
<p>也是不久以前的不久，發勝利財者眞不知有多少。這裏面包括了「刦收」的大員，投機的巨商和與民爭利的豪門，眞個是形形式式，十色五光。這都是不守法的。守法的任人宰割，宰割到喘不過氣，甚至連水準以下的生活也無法維持，公敎人員與薪水階級，都屬於這一類。因而我的第二個結論是：守法的無法生活。</p>
<p>又是不久以前的不久，奮國難財的又大有其人。其角色也是這一類，自由區和淪陷區都一樣。守法的也只有任人擺佈的一法。因而我的第三個結論利第二個大同小異，是：守法的只好苟延殘喘。</p>
<p>沒有金條似乎與生命無關，但無法生活與苟延殘喘，却嚴重得多了。因為無法生活和苟延殘喘的第二步，便際藏着死。</p>
<p>目前我們有多少無法生活的人，苟延殘喘的人？尚無統計。但確實不少，却不能諱言。</p>
<p>奉公守法是何等高尚的操行，但它的出路只有貧窮，飢寒和死亡，這是多可怕的諷刺。山口良忠這種寗死都要守法的精神，在實於耽巧者的心目中，是白痴，是笨伯，而對奉公守法者也是一個很大的打擊，因為事實已明白地說出它的後果了，雖說這只不過是日本的一件小事件。</p>
<p>拉斯基（Laski）說得好：在人們活得舒服以前，他們必須先活着．希望袞袞諸公，不要忘記了這淺薄但却確實的眞理！何况我們到底是戰勝國。</p>
<h3>眼睛一霎</h3>
<p>— 林</p>
<p>美國的科學家用一種極小極輕的鏡子裝在一個人的上眼皮上，然後用一種間歇發光的光綫，每百分之一秒照射這鏡子一次，這光綫正好反射到一張照相底片上。於是，那個人的上眼皮一開一闔，都在這照相底片上留下了紀錄。</p>
<p>那些科學家得到了道些一結論；</p>
<p>人們「眼睛一霎」時先後所費的時間平均為十分之四秒——上眼皮向下合時，費時百分之五秒；上眼皮留在下面（卽眼購合上）的時間，計百分之十五秒；上眼皮抬起到恢復原來的位置，共需時十分之二秒。</p>
<h3>出身</h3>
<p>— 南無</p>
<p>幾個朋友談天，偶然提起了某一個略有名氣或地位的人物，往往就會有一個人掛起了一絲神秘的笑容，說：「某人嗎？你們可知道他是什麼出身」他好像以能得到這種「獨得之秘」為光榮。而大家對於愈是隱私的東西，偏是發生的興趣特別濃厚，於是不斷的追問，而那位先生便得意洋洋地說：「啊，他本來是一個小木匠啊！」</p>
<p>這時，大家深感滿意了。不但因為又探得了一件別人家的私事，也更因為自己覺得有一種優越感—啊，我現在的地位雖不及你高，名氣雖不及你饗，財產雖不及你多，可是，我的出身却比你好得多了。哈，一個小木匠出身的人居然發了這樣大的財，交了這樣好的紅運！這不是暴發戶嗎，有什麼希奇！</p>
<p>而有許多名人之流也惟恐人家提起他們的舊賬。譬如說，我的故鄉有一位老晝家，年輕時曾在一家典當裏做過職員，因為事情頗為空閑，偶然便隨意塗抹起來，後來居然出了名，可是第一椿要務就是改換名字，口口聲聲說自已是世代書香人家出身，絕口不提「典當」兩字，彷彿是他一生之玷似的。有一次，有一個年輕的學生竟冒失地問他和某典當有無關係，而這某典當却正是那位老畫師當年工作的地方。那位老畫師認為這學生是故意和他搗蛋，竟然氣得　鬚倒堅，七竅生烟，大碰桌子，把所有桌上的文具古玩之類摔了一地，最後還是顫巍巍的把那個學生帶打帶踢的趕了出去，弄得那個學生莫名其妙。</p>
<p>其實，做木匠有什麼不好？做過典當職員又有什麼不如人的地方呢？木匠們用自己的勞力換取正當的報酬，正是仰不愧於天，俯不作於人的好男兒。而典當職員也是正正當當的職業，何嘗有什慶令人慚愧的地方。比起那種一天到晚伺候東翁顏色的淸客師爺之類，工人和商人正不知高出了多少。從興當職員到畫家，其意義就等於一個賣糖炒栗子的人改行賣炒白果，都是以自己的服務換錢，有什麼貴賤之別呢？</p>
<p>在外國人方面，情形正好和此相反。我們常常聽人謂愛迪生是賣報童子出身，富蘭克林剛到費城的時候是窮無立雄之地的一個小小學徒，林肯幼年之貧苦勤學更是平已膾炙人口。那些人選擇了一條最適合自己興趣和志商的這路，百折不回，都得到了輝煌的成功。他們從來不諱言自己的過去，而林肯的苦學誠樸，竟成為他競選大總統時的一大助力。</p>
<p>別人的眼睛是望前面看的，他們所重親的是「現在」；而我們却還有那麼些人念念不忘於過去，用盡方法，以在自己的祖先中找出一個做過官的人為快事。至今還有人特別關心別人的「出身」，也至今還有人動輒要捧出「先××世祖××（諡號）公」來，實在令人感到有些悲哀。</p>
<h3>歸途</h3>
<p>— 丁道衡</p>
<p>漫矜　計及秋邊，情瘦嫌峯更甚前，一事未乾行　　，數聲又喚渡頭船，哀歸苦柳長隨客，小鳥　滬不　天，此去漁鄉好風日，桑陰安羅席　篇。</p>
<h3>抵揚州作</h3>
<p>風　　　認揚州，　　車際漢漢　，人物略嫌脂粉氣，山川何負帝王游？千家管吹中青沸，十里茶烟曉市與，惟有南唐殘廟佛，興亡閱盡只低　。</p>
<h3>「無法投遞」</h3>
<p>— 方白</p>
<p>波斯的郵政規章是禁止剃刀片郵寄八境的。英國的郵政局則不准人民郵寄香水到南非的巴蘇托侖（英殖民地）去。</p>
<p>黎巴嫩拒絕郵寄發　的乳酪或果醬八境。土耳其不許郵寄糖漿和攙維灰泥的麵粉。如果你想將孩子們遊戲用的粉筆寄到埃及去，那你必須在盒上用阿刺伯文或他種文字寫上「有毒」的字樣。</p>
<p>墨西哥的豆無法郵寄到印度去。緬甸禁止烏獸的皮毛郵寄八境，但可製標本用的駝鳥皮毛不在禁例。加拿大禁止郵寄實蜂，保加利亞也是一樣。而每年除了八月一日至九月一日，二月一日至三月十五日這二段時期外，郵寄蠶卵在保加利亞也是嚴禁的。</p>
<p>中美洲的危地馬拉拒絕郵寄鬥鷄用的鷄距鐵八境。哥侖比亞禁止郵寄噴射催淚性氣體用的器械八境。海地島上的多明尼加共和國則絕對禁止郵寄小匕首。</p>
<h3>書林雜憶</h3>
<p>— 錢大成</p>
<p>十年以來，所至訪書，知見善本遂頗不鮮，於書林掌故，亦稍稍留意。今年講述之餘，恒多暇日。因述數則，以實「自由談」；後當賡續述之。</p>
<p>嘗於友人龐雲齊（士龍）所，得見錢運王手鈔校本「烈皇本紀」兩厚冊，以「初有學集箋注」墨格稿紙抄寫，「學集」二字上皆空一字，全書塗改殊多，與今通行刊本絕不類。愧未得向雲齋借來一校。此書雲齊以包愼伯楹聯等數物與人相易。遵王手鈔本絕罕見，其「初有學集箋注」稿本，舊藏曾孟樸先生所，今聞已易主矣。</p>
<p>同邑書估嚴瑞峯，舊書業中之霸才也。瑞峯曾在邑中季仙九制軍後裔處，購得曾文正箋注仙九「丹魁堂詩集」。文正親筆注於刊本眉端，密行細字，標注殆遍。蓋仙九乃文正座師，「求闕齋集」中曾有「季仙九師五十壽序」及「題季仙九師采蘭藝菊圓」，一詩一文，具見其師弟因綠焉。然文正為仙九為注詩，則世未有知之者。卽仙九後人，亦維亂書中售出，朱必知有是書。今瑞峯歿已數年，此書殊難踪跡矣。</p>
<p>民國初年，趙氏「舊山樓」藏書有易主意。丁初我張雙南王紀玉三先生擬合力往講，以貶其值，趙氏不允出售。紀玉雙南二先生謂稍增價若干，初我先生有難色，遂作罷。後終乃為初我先生獨資購去，頗有宋元善本，也是園舊職元人雜劇亦在其中。初我先生歿後，卽丁倭亂，其藏醫散出，此事遂大白於世。初我先生治板本之學負當世大名，當另為文以張之。（編者按：余曾於蘇州冷機得初我先生藏書韋，亦意外勝緣也。）</p>
<h3>鹽政專家張岱杉</h3>
<p>— 陳左高</p>
<p>民初宦海人物寥落殆盡。其一若張丈岱杉，以精鹽務，兩主財政，在項城竊柄，奉張肆威日，固一度風雲際會，屑行瑣事，有足述者。</p>
<p>丈原諱夢鰲，字戴三，別號超觀閣主，清末壬寅舉人，應試詩改諱日弧，字岱杉，榜發，捷報抵寓，家人不知夢驚更名，相顧愕然。丈原籍浙江山陰，乃翁杜　久，因挺於官舍，旣長，留閩食祿，舉動習慣言語，無一不類福建人，遇者恒曰：「吾疑張某非浙產矣。「當廣子辛丑間，左高先叔祖心泉公，任南台銅圓提調，丈與家父同寅僚，几案相共，飲食與俱。旋均奉調學務公所，時饒漢祥僅一實業課課員，觀丈面，彼此言淺，頗相輕也。</p>
<p>渠家素貧，內乏儘僕，每朝趨廨署前夫人，梁氏窺鏡梳洗，丈則逗兒笑噱，操勞如賢婦，嘗苦妻病，遲考三年，伉儘篤情，譽滿　里。旣中式，治理間浙轅門文案，　為將軍崇某（滿人）所參，卒免官去。綠程聽彝（福建觀棄）紹介，進吉林官運局，是為八鹽政之始。未幾，熊希齡任東三省　運便，聞其能，　以科長職。光復後，熊膺財政總長攝總揆，鑒丈功在保存吉林庫藏巨款及印信，遂簡放長蘆鹽運使，再遷兩淮鹽運使，其間擘劃鹽務章程，規定增產細則，調整稽核所，條分樓析，聲譽著車。洎徐寶山案起丈，斡旋調解，事以謐息，累功長財次，兼鹽務署署長。時項城專政，駕京部次長稱才幹者，輒推紫　虎（恭綽，交通次長）徐又錚（樹錚陸軍次長）張岱杉三氏，所謂三大名次長者是。項城於丈，日必諮詢，禮遇幾駕總長而上之。厥後，項城歿，張作霖特加羅政，始隸奉系，一任幣制局總裁，兩　財長。</p>
<p>席知旣編高位，數數易　移　，先納某婦，婦為梁夫人梳頭婆，娓之，蒙眷與常。逾二歲，又　婦為瘋子，更娶婦之梳頭女，殊賢淑，得偕老。</p>
<p>說者稱丈皮蔽書畫板本，馳農南北，平居恂恂儒雅，極器重學人，嘗服膺方地山（爾謙）精於檢帖，俯拾卽是，遂以揚州十二圩棧長任之。惜乎晚歲好　滿，卒以傾家，蟄居鬱鬱。逮盧溝橋事變前，國府財政當局某公，　促整理鹽政，藉收駕輕就熟之效，時已　病垂危，卒莫能興，逝於故都蘇州胡同，一室湫隘，客窗孤證，回首當年，何異夢境。初丈居間垣時，迷信屋相術，時語人曰：「衛者謂吾人字，為乙亥乙酉乙亥乙酉　潛爵位者在此，靡克善終者亦在此。」　棺論定，究不失為　政專家云。</p>

<h3>Weng Wenhao Attends Legislative Yuan Meeting, Frankly Explains the Financial and Economic Situation, Controls Floating Capital and Regulates the Market to Solve the Price Problem, Will Open Self-Funded Foreign Exchange for Import of Materials</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 18th] The Legislative Yuan held a closed-door meeting to review prices, starting at 9:30 AM on the 18th. Over 400 members attended. President Sun Ke was absent due to other business and was replaced by Vice President Chen Lifu as chairman. Premier Weng Wenhao, Minister of Finance Wang Yunwu, Minister of Social Affairs Gu Zhenggang, Minister of Food Guan Jiyu, Minister of Industry and Commerce Chen Qitian, and Deputy Minister of Finance Xu Baiyuan attended. Premier Weng gave a review of the financial and economic situation since the issuance of the Gold Yuan. He explained that from August 19th to the end of September, the amount of gold, silver, and foreign currency collected, export revenue, remittances from overseas Chinese, and foreign currency deposits received by the Central Bank exceeded tens of millions of yuan and are still increasing. Regarding the illegal trading by Communist bandits and unscrupulous speculators in various places in North and South China, which has created a black market for gold banknotes, the government is closely monitoring the situation and will take strong measures to combat it. Interest rates and exchange rates in the financial market have been effectively suppressed. This success has increased the deposits received by state-owned banks by three times and the deposits received by commercial banks by seven times, totaling over 180 million Gold Yuan more than before August 19th. Regarding the price problem, Weng frankly admitted that the government did not take into account the fact that the black market rates in the Southwest were far lower than in Nanjing and Shanghai when formulating the exchange rate between the Gold Yuan and the US dollar. The sudden increase in the exchange rate affected prices, and the nickel coin craze in Chengdu and Kunming also destabilized the people and caused prices to soar. Furthermore, since August 19th, the collection of gold, silver, and foreign currency accounted for two-thirds of the amount of Gold Yuan issued. This large amount of floating capital has flooded the market, creating a buying spree and causing prices to rise sharply. Weng also stated that the failure to thoroughly freeze prices was a major mistake. As for the situation of productive enterprises, the reality today is unfortunately the opposite of the original estimates, and the reasons for this are even more complex. When prices were frozen on August 19th, raw material prices had already risen, but the prices of finished products had not been adjusted. After manufacturers produced finished products, the selling price was less than the cost, and production was suspended. In addition, frozen freight rates and rising fuel costs hindered the transportation of goods. State-owned banks and private banks did not provide many loans, resulting in insufficient working capital for productive enterprises. The influence of the military situation also caused productive enterprises to shrink. During his report, Weng spoke sincerely. After frankly explaining the current financial and economic situation, he proposed that the government would solve the current price problem by controlling floating capital and regulating the market. The measures taken by the government to control floating capital have gradually shown results. For example, the issuance of short-term treasury bills has reached 100 million Gold Yuan, the sale of shares in state-owned enterprises has reached 6 million Gold Yuan, and the encouragement of commercial banks to increase capital can reach 100 million Gold Yuan. In the future, it is planned to accelerate the sale of enemy and puppet property and gradually prepare to issue company bonds for legitimate productive enterprises, and open up the use of foreign exchange deposits. The shares of state-owned enterprises will be guaranteed interest, and credit will be enhanced by reorganizing the board of directors and inviting new shareholders to visit. In addition, the flow of funds and the transportation of raw materials and finished products for productive enterprises will be facilitated as much as possible. Regarding the regulation of the cloth market, the government is determined to do everything possible to crack down on hoarding, channel the sources of materials, and promote commercial stability by setting reasonable price limits based on fair principles.</p>
<h3>The Center of Fighting in the Suburbs of Taiyuan Shifts to the Mountainous Area, Cannon Fire All Night Along the Line from the Southeast to the Northeast of the City</h3>
<p>[Our Xi'an Dispatch, 18th] The fighting on the outskirts of Taiyuan is quite fierce, with the bandits constantly sending reinforcements and launching several fierce attacks. The fighting was particularly intense last night in Pingtou, Shizui, and Qianhou Licun in the suburbs of Taiyuan. A bandit column and artillery regiment that fled west from Shizhuang have now crossed Yuchi and headed north.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Taiyuan, 18th] The focus of the fighting in the suburbs of Taiyuan has recently shifted to the mountainous area from the southeast to the northeast of the city. The strongholds of Heituo Zaoyuan, Madigou, Gaoyadi, and Jiehua, about 20 li southeast of the city, and Guadigou, 15 li northeast of the city, and Yulinping, over 20 li from the city, were the scenes of fierce fighting all night on the 17th, with loud cannon fire clearly audible in the city. The 44th and 38th Brigades of bandits attacking Heituo Zaoyuan suffered heavy casualties after being severely beaten by the National Army. By 10:00 AM, the offensive had stalled. The 4th and Ye 3 Brigades of bandits attacking Yulinping repeatedly charged the National Army positions under the cover of artillery fire but were all repelled. The National Army is still engaged in fierce fighting with the bandits in Guadigou and Madigou. Furthermore, in the afternoon, the National Army, in close cooperation with the infantry and artillery, launched a sweep against the bandits near Nanpingtou, about 20 li south of the city. The bandits stubbornly resisted, but were fiercely attacked by the strong firepower of the regiment, and the air force also provided air support. Most of the bandits' fortifications were destroyed, and over 600 were killed or wounded.</p>
<h3>Song Ziwen Returns to Guangzhou From Hong Kong</h3>
<p>[Our Guangzhou Dispatch, 18th] Chairman Song Ziwen returned to Guangzhou by special plane from Hong Kong at 2:00 PM on the 18th. He was accompanied by Ding Shiqi, Manager of the Central Bank, Huang Guang, Manager of the Bank of Communications, and others.</p>
<h3>Wang Yunwu's Report</h3>
<p>After Premier Weng's report, Minister of Finance Wang made supplementary explanations. Based on statistical data, he analyzed the price changes before and after 1949, and cited the price examples of rice, coal, and cotton cloth to point out that price increases and decreases varied from place to place after the currency reform. The recent fluctuations were actually due to the disturbances by the Communist bandits, the changes in the military situation, the obstruction of material transportation, and the instability of social psychology. He stated that the government is actively carrying out measures to stabilize prices, which are divided into five items: (1) Increasing production: 20 million US dollars of industrial raw materials will be imported, and efforts will be made to eliminate manufacturers' concerns and actively increase production. (2) Saving consumption: resolute measures will be taken to thoroughly implement savings. (3) Clearing materials: self-funded foreign exchange will be opened for the import of materials, and local governments and troops will be strictly ordered not to hinder the flow of materials. (4) Controlling floating capital. (5) Reasonable price limits: hoarding will be absolutely prohibited. From 11:00 AM, members began to question. Six people spoke and submitted written questions in the morning, mostly hoping that the government would implement laws and regulations to gain the trust of the people, and strictly and earnestly crack down on various black markets to prevent the Communist bandits from taking the opportunity to cause trouble. The meeting adjourned at noon. The meeting continued at around 3:00 PM in the afternoon. More than ten people continued to speak and submit written questions, all advocating that the government should stabilize the currency system, crack down on the gold banknote black market, step up mass production, and implement comprehensive distribution. At 5:40 PM, more than 20 people had not had time to speak or read their written opinions, but due to the urgency of time, with the approval of the chairman and the members, the speech was stopped, and Premier Weng and Minister Wang were asked to answer. Mr. Weng gave a brief reply to several questions and reiterated the government's determination to maintain the Gold Yuan, asking the members to inform all sectors of society not to lightly believe rumors and shake confidence, and hoping that the members would supervise the responsible executors of various departments at any time. The government is willing to humbly accept the valuable opinions of the members. Minister of Finance Wang first stated: "The reserve of gold bonds is increasing day by day, and its issuance is made public on a monthly basis. The current amount of issuance is far from the maximum amount of issuance and cannot be said to have reached the point of expansion." Mr. Wang explained the reason why tax revenues were low in July, August, and September, saying that the taxes collected in July and August were calculated in legal tender and levied at the old tax rate, so the amount in July, August, and September was very small, but the number of collections in the next three months will inevitably increase, and revenue and expenditure will gradually tend to balance. The registration of foreign assets abroad is being promoted in various places, and powerful overseas Chinese businessmen are determined to take the lead, so the future is optimistic. Regarding the capital increase of banks, it will never be extended. Regarding the issue of price adjustment, Mr. Wang said: "When is the most appropriate time for price adjustment, the government still needs to consider carefully, and the time for decision has not yet arrived." The meeting was adjourned at 6:15 PM.</p>
<h3>ECA and the US Aid Utilization Committee Announce Continued Allocation of Construction Parts Fund, A Total of 37.75 Million US Dollars Allocated, Shanghai Electric Power Company Receives Construction Loan of 5 Million US Dollars</h3>
<p>[ECA, This City] The fund for the ECA's Construction and Parts Replenishment Program for China, with an approved fund of 70 million US dollars, was jointly announced by the ECA and the US Aid Utilization Committee on the 18th that it would allocate another 37.75 million US dollars from this fund.</p>
<p>The newly approved amount for parts is 12.75 million US dollars, which, together with the previously announced 22.25 million US dollars, brings the total approved amount for the parts program to 35 million US dollars. This fund is a form of grant to assist the Chinese government.</p>
<p>Regarding the construction plan portion, the approved amount is stipulated to be 35 million US dollars, and the total amount announced today is 25 million US dollars, which is the first announced allocation under the construction plan. This aid will be in the form of loans to China. Among the ECA's 275 million US dollar economic aid plan to China, the above-mentioned aid is the only one intended to be in the form of loans.</p>
<p>This announcement was made by Yan Jiagan, a member of the US Aid Utilization Committee, and Stuart Lipton, head of the ECA China Technical Investigation Team.</p>
<p>The allocation of new parts plan funds is as follows: New approved amount of 6 million US dollars for the transportation and traffic parts replenishment plan. Parts plan for coal mines across the country, 1 million US dollars. Parts plan for tin, antimony, and tungsten mines in Central China, South China, and Southwest China, 500,000 US dollars. Other parts plans, 5.25 million US dollars (public utilities power plants that failed to obtain the foreign exchange needed for the required parts plan from the Export Council in the past can obtain some assistance under this item).</p>
<p>The factories and mines that have received recovery loans are as follows:</p>
<p>Coal mines: Huainan Coal Mine in the Yangtze River Basin, 3.5 million US dollars, Nanshu Coal Mine in South China, 750,000 US dollars, coal mines in Central China, South China, and Taiwan, 750,000 US dollars, Gaokuang Coal Mine in Central China and South China, 400 US dollars.</p>
<p>Electricity, Shanghai Electric Power Company 5 million US dollars, Taiwan Electric Power Company 3.5 million US dollars (including 1.5 million US dollars for the proposed Taiwan General Fertilizer Company).</p>

<p>Tin and antimony mines: Southwestern Central China and South China 2 million US dollars.</p>
<p>It is generally expected that various coal mines that are eligible for assistance will now submit their plan proposals to the Joint Committee on Parts Recovery of the US Aid Utilization Committee and the Economic Cooperation Administration.</p>
<p>The above-mentioned beneficiaries can now select design engineers to submit suggestions to the Joint Committee.</p>
<p>These engineering firms will be responsible for implementing these plans at the lowest cost and in the shortest time.</p>
<p>The engineering firm must submit a pledge representing its plan, which is countersigned by the technician executing the plan. This pledge will prove that based on appropriate technical surveys, the plan can be expected to produce the highest degree of efficiency at the lowest possible cost.</p>
<p>The pledge will be submitted to a review agency, namely the special engineering firm hired by the Chinese government, which serves as the consultant and supervising engineer for the Joint Committee.</p>
<p>[US News Agency, This City] The bulletin issued by the US Aid Utilization Committee and the Economic Cooperation Longitudinal Office on the 18th regarding industrial parts and recovery plans raised the different issues of donations and loans.</p>
<p>All parts plans are funded under the grant item. In fact, what is called a grant is a kind of US dollar loan that the Chinese government does not need to repay.</p>
<p>The recovery plan is funded under the loan item. A loan is also a kind of foreign exchange loan to the Chinese government, but the Chinese government is responsible for repayment to the United States.</p>
<p>Of the 275 million US dollars allocated under the name of economic aid to China, only 35 million US dollars are included under the loan item.</p>
<p>Regardless of whether the aid is granted or loaned, the foreign exchange provided by the United States to China will enable China to import materials and equipment that are necessary for domestic recovery and cannot be obtained without US aid.</p>
<h3>Hope for Increased US Aid, Aid to China to Double</h3>
<p>Truman, Hoffman, Lapham Meeting</p>
<p>[United Press International, Washington, 17th] President Truman held an unusual Sunday meeting on the 17th with Economic Cooperation Administration (ECA) Director Hoffman and ECA China Mission Chief Lapham. It is said that Truman was very pleased with the outcome. White House Press Secretary Ross stated that the two presented the President with a "progress report" on the $275 million economic aid plan for China. They stated that $70 million has been allocated for special reconstruction projects so far. Lapham told the President that the plan is "helping" to stop the spread of communism in the East.</p>
<p>White House Press Secretary Ross stated that Truman was "pleased" with the results of the plan to date and was happy to learn that the funds were also being used for the ECA program in North China. Assistance to China has become a major issue in the election campaign. Republicans argue that more economic aid should be given to this wartime ally as part of a global effort to contain communism. Dewey said last week that a Republican government would end "our neglect of old allies and friends."</p>
<p>Hoffman and Lapham declined to discuss the China aid plan with reporters beyond general principles. It is rumored that the ECA hopes to double the $275 million economic aid plan for China and allocate an additional $125 million to the current $125 million in military aid. Lapham spent four months in the Far East and recently returned to the United States. He plans to return to China in two weeks.</p>
<p>[United States Information Service, Washington, 17th] The ECA reported on the 17th that the total approved amount of ECA grants to China has reached $97,023,722 as of October 15.</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Examining the Essence of the Yoshida Cabinet</h3>
<p>Japanese politics have returned to calm after a storm. The Yoshida Cabinet, succeeding Ashida, will complete the appointment of its cabinet members today. Shigeru Yoshida leads a group of "newcomers" onto the stage, starting their journey under the attention of the Allied forces. Judging by the cabinet lineup, it seems like a single-party cabinet; looking at Yoshida's weight in the cabinet, he resembles a party dictator; considering his reserved attitude, stubborn words, and even the policies of the Democratic Liberal Party, we unreservedly believe that the Yoshida Cabinet is an extremely conservative cabinet, and the one with the most pronounced conservative character among the six post-war cabinets.</p>
<p>The Japanese media predict that the Yoshida Cabinet will be short-lived, and critics call Yoshida an extremely conservative and right-leaning figure whose political life will be brief. According to this view, the storm in Japanese politics has not truly passed; it will return intermittently and eventually topple Yoshida. In fact, this observation is not entirely accurate; the Yoshida Cabinet may stand firm and linger for a considerable time.</p>
<p>Judging the life of a political party and the life of a government cannot be evaluated solely by their conservative or progressive nature, nor can it be measured solely by the duration of time. One should assess them from the perspective of international politics and background relations to be more accurate. In today's Japanese politics, the left-wing path is impassable, and left-leaning parties lack strength. Therefore, the strength of right-leaning conservatives arises accordingly. The left and right cannot be equal, and the width of the middle road is too large, so the "middle politics" cannot stand between the left and right, which is an inevitable situation. The fall of the Ashida Cabinet illustrates the fall of Japan's centrist politics, and also shows that the background of Japanese political parties lacks the existence of this "middle" class. The Yoshida's Democratic Liberal Party and its current cabinet have relatively prominent political character and class background:</p>
<p>First, the Democratic Liberal Party advocates absolute free capitalism, opposes socialism and so-called revisionist capitalism, and is deeply supported by Japanese capitalists and zaibatsu. After the news of the House of Representatives' vote on the 14th to elect Yoshida as Prime Minister spread, the Tokyo stock market rose uniformly, indicating that the financial market welcomes the Yoshida Cabinet.</p>
<p>Second, Yoshida represents an old Japanese system. He relies on the court nobility and landlords as his pillars. The core figures of the Democratic Liberal Party mostly come from zaibatsu and landlords, or people who depend on capitalism for survival. Although Yoshida himself is a bureaucrat, he does not like bureaucrats or professional politicians. The Democratic Liberal Party's election expenses do not require extortion or corruption. It has the expenses of zaibatsu and landlords. The source of wealth for zaibatsu and landlords relies on exploitation and profits. The government only protects its exploitation and profits, so it does not rely on the government for corruption. Yoshida's cabinet has selected a group of newcomers, that is, seeking a group of capitalists and landlord representatives to take the stage, so he can boldly and confidently say: The evaluation of cabinet personnel is based on competence and integrity as conditions. This is the difference in political character and class background between the Yoshida Cabinet and the Ashida Cabinet. As for whether the Yoshida Cabinet is a short-lived cabinet, it depends on the cabinet's measures in the future.</p>
<p>Yoshida emerged representing the old Japanese model. He governs as the protector of the interests of zaibatsu and landlords. Its policies are biased towards the revival of old Japan, and there is no doubt that it will protect the interests of zaibatsu and landlords. The special parliament is currently underway. The biggest measure of the Yoshida Cabinet is to find a way to pass the amendment to the "National Public Service Law," and may use the pressure of the Allied Headquarters to suppress the Socialist Party's "labor offensive." Whether it is necessary to dissolve and conduct a general election after the parliamentary mission is completed is not important in Yoshida's view. In today's Japan, the power of conservative right-wing forces is generally rising. The victory of the general election may belong to the Democratic Liberal Party, which Yoshida is quite confident in. If he politically leans towards conservatism, deifies the emperor, economically suppresses labor unrest internally, and carries out East Asian economic co-prosperity externally, and focuses on the victory of the peace conference, he may gain considerable support. Although Yoshida is more stubborn than Katayama and Ashida, he is better at governing than Katayama and Ashida, thereby winning the hearts of the old Japanese people. When Yoshida was ordered to form a cabinet this time, he visited MacArthur twice, requesting that the Allied Headquarters personnel not interfere in Japanese politics and personnel; this shows that Yoshida has full confidence in the revival of old Japan. The Yoshida Cabinet lacks democracy and progress, which is inevitable. Its emergence is to lead Japanese politics towards a conservative path, and everything will gradually return to its former state!</p>
<h3>UN Tariff and Trade General Agreement Has Been Amended, New Member States Are Negotiating with Member States</h3>
<p>Zhu Returns to Talk About Geneva</p>
<p>[This Newspaper, Nanjing, 18th] Zhu Xie, the representative of our country attending the United Nations Tariff and Trade Conference in Geneva, returned to China a few days ago. According to Zhu's remarks on the 18th, this conference was divided into two sessions, one for the contracting parties to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, and one for the second session of the Interim Committee of the International Trade Organization. Regarding the former, two important cases were passed: (1) Thirteen countries, including Norway, Denmark, and Pakistan, which newly joined the agreement, should conduct tariff negotiations with each member state in accordance with the provisions of the General Agreement, mutually reduce tariffs, and establish a bilateral agreement, and it is scheduled to hold tariff negotiations in Geneva on April 1 next year; (2) Amend the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, and replace Articles 3, 6, 13, 15, and 26 of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade with the relevant provisions in the International Trade Charter; (3) Allow the West German and American occupation zones to apply the General Agreement. The original intention of the United States was to propose West Germany and Japan at the same time, and request unconditional enjoyment of tariff reduction treatment by various countries. However, after China, the United Kingdom, India, the Netherlands and other countries objected, Japan was not proposed, but the West General Agreement is a separate agreement and has nothing to do with the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. However, our country's representative did not sign to avoid Japan citing precedents in the future. As for the second session of the Provisional Executive Committee of the International Trade Organization, most of the resolutions passed were internal regulations and organizational matters of international trade. The two conferences lasted for six weeks. A few days ago, the countries that newly joined the General Agreement have begun to conduct tariff negotiations with various members.</p>

<h3>Truman Elaborates on U.S. Foreign Policy: Persevering in the Pursuit of Peace, Hoping for Soviet Understanding and Cooperation</h3>
<p>[News Agency Report] Washington, 18th Broadcast: President Truman delivered a speech today elaborating on the United States' foreign policy, stating, "I have consistently used every opportunity to strive for peace, and this determination has never wavered. Whenever an appropriate opportunity arises, I will unite with allies within the framework of the United Nations to promote the cause of peace." Truman stated that the United States will dedicate its full strength to the cause of peace, upon which the fate of humanity rests. U.S. policy is not aimed at the Soviet Union; "On the contrary, we recognize that world peace depends on mutual understanding and friendly relations between the Soviet Union and democratic nations." Truman continued, "The firm stance taken by the United States should not be misunderstood as militarism. A firm stance based on reasonable grounds can give us hope for peace." Truman reviewed the U.S. foreign policy of the past two years, the main measures of which were three: (1) Providing military assistance to Greece and Turkey; (2) The European Economic Recovery Program; (3) Establishing a Western German economic organization in conjunction with the United Kingdom and France. He stated, "World peace and economic recovery cannot be achieved in a state of political instability, so we believe it is necessary to help stabilize countries with democratic traditions and aspirations." He stated that there is no hope for an early resolution of international disputes, but the United States absolutely does not want to use war as a method to resolve world disputes. "In international politics, new and serious difficulties are constantly arising, and the time when the great powers can form a world family is still far off." Truman called on the world to be patient, urging that international hatreds become a thing of the past. History shows us that "enemy countries can coexist peacefully in the world. When the entire fate of humanity faces a critical juncture, we must exercise the greatest patience. We should use every opportunity to strengthen the United Nations organization in order to undertake the arduous tasks at hand." President Truman's above speech was delivered at the annual meeting of the American Legion in Florida.</p>

Austin accused the Soviet Union of proposing the simultaneous destruction of U.S. atomic bomb stockpiles and the establishment of an international atomic energy control agency as merely a "tactic."</p>
<p>The intention is nothing more than to destroy U.S. atomic bombs before the world knows for sure whether the Soviet Union possesses such weapons. Austin stated that the United States has no intention of giving up its atomic weapons unless a fully effective control mechanism is established to guarantee that other countries do not and cannot acquire such weapons. Soviet representative Malik responded to Austin by repeatedly reiterating the old claim that the Soviet Union had made significant concessions, and condemned the fact that the United Kingdom and the United States had agreed to remain silent on the Soviet Union's atomic energy proposals. Malik concluded by saying: "Austin's talk of closed doors and iron curtains cannot explain why the Soviet Union's plan is unacceptable." He stated that the U.S. atomic plan has no intention of international control, "only for uncontrolled ownership and management, as well as U.S. monopolization of the production and development of atomic energy." Austin continued to attack the Soviet Union's secrecy, and warned that if the Soviet Union refuses to participate in world organizations and cooperate together, there can be no security. As long as this situation exists, the world will doubt the Soviet Union's motives and need to arm themselves for defense. Communist countries that want to live in a secret world are bound to prepare for war, and we do not want to live in such a world. This is the difficult situation faced by the United Nations Atomic Energy Commission, he said.</p>

<p>[Our Report] Paris, 18th Broadcast: U.S. representative Dulles, who attended the UN General Assembly, stated at a press conference on the 18th after returning from his visit to Germany and Austria that the Soviet blockade of Berlin has caused a significant reaction favorable to the Western powers.

<h3>Six Preludes to the US Election: Miscellaneous Notes on US Election Regulations - Dewey's Victory is Undoubted</h3>
<p>— Special Correspondent Mao Shuqing</p>
<p>[New York Airmail] The US election is just over ten days away, and the "horse racing tickets" in New York are selling at sixteen to one. These "horse racing tickets" refer to the presidential prediction lottery organized by various clubs. If you bet one dollar on Truman being elected, and Truman actually wins, you can win ten dollars. Conversely, if you bet one dollar on Dewey winning, and Dewey wins, you only win one-sixteenth of a dollar. It is said that these days, Philadelphia is only at eight to one, Chicago is probably around five to one, and the most amazing thing is that Truman's hometown—Missouri—has also reached four to one.</p>
<p>The overall situation of victory or defeat is probably already clear. The key question is, what will the election result look like in terms of proportions? Some say that this year, the result of the national "individual votes" will inevitably be an overwhelming advantage for Dewey, even exceeding the "sum" of all other candidates combined. Others say that Dewey's election this time will be an advantage like Roosevelt's overwhelming of Hoover in 1932. To express it with a Chinese idiom, it can be called "when water flows, a channel is formed," or it can be said to be "what the people want." Probably, Dewey's victory is no longer a question.</p>
<p>A few days ago, while covering the third annual meeting of the World Monetary Fund and the World Bank, I took a trip to Washington and indirectly heard secret stories from the White House, saying that Truman had already developed a nervous disorder, and his daily life, including eating and sleeping, was already different. This President Truman, who has the flavor of a Missouri farmer, probably knows seventy percent that his fate is "inevitable failure," and he is so anxiously flustered. During the campaign in the Midwest, he cursed the Republican Party, and his tone was even more outrageous than that of a "village woman." Back in Washington, he suddenly proposed sending "Vincent" as an envoy to Moscow, which made Marshall's hair stand on end with anger. The Washington newspapers are relentlessly mocking Truman. One newspaper said: "The Berlin crisis is about to fall apart, and the situation is so serious, and our President suddenly runs off to travel and campaign for such a long time. He is still leisurely kissing country children"!</p>
<p>However, according to people around Truman, the old man "insists" on being re-elected. Presumably, there is an addiction to being an official, and there is an unspeakable "wonderful thing" about being the president of a country. However, in another state of mind, he knows that his ability is not as good as Dewey's, his reputation is not as good as Dewey's, and his administrative experience is not as good as Dewey's. Recently, Truman went to Philadelphia, and on the guest signature book of "Independence Hall" in Philadelphia, he wrote "White House Communication Office," and then added parentheses, noting "temporary." His self-awareness and his "occupying" desire are forever at odds, which may be the real reason for his "nervous disorder."</p>
<p>The Democratic Party has occupied the White House for sixteen years, and Truman can be considered to have sung a closing performance. According to American political scientists, if a political party stays in power for too long, it will inevitably cause a split within the party itself. As a result, talents will cancel each other out, and eventually they will fail in the election arena. If this hypothesis is an inevitable phenomenon of democratic normalcy, then Wallace and the die-hard Southerners' departure is a prelude to the Democratic Party's defeat this November. Today, many insightful Americans believe that the Democratic Party cannot produce a decent "team." Truman's vice-presidential candidate is an old man in his seventies, and there is no other impressive figure. On the Republican side, there are plenty of talents, the lineup is neat enough, and Dewey himself is constantly talking about "unity and solidarity." The Republican Party of 1948 in the United States really has such a unified and united lineup, which is a difficult hurdle that Truman cannot overcome.</p>
<p>The election date is November 2nd. According to the US constitution and precedents, the quadrennial election is held on the "Tuesday" after the first "Monday" in November. The first Monday in November this year is November 1st, so the election is on the 2nd. Simultaneously elected with the President and Vice President are one-third of the Senators (i.e., Upper House members) and all members of the House of Representatives. There are ninety-six members of the Senate, and thirty-two will be re-elected this year. All four hundred and thirty-five members of the House of Representatives will be re-elected. In addition, thirty-two governors, state senators, judges, jurors, etc., will also be re-elected on the same day on one ballot. Therefore, all parties and factions are busy competing in the election, not only for the President, but also for the more important Senators and Representatives.</p>
<p>In the 1946 election for the Senate and House of Representatives, the Republican Party won a complete victory. The situation this year is slightly different. Generally speaking, the Republican Party has a greater chance in the House of Representatives, and the Democratic Party may turn into an advantage in the Senate. Ambassador Hurley, who lived in Chongqing for a long time during the Anti-Japanese War, is actively running for the position of federal senator (each state has only two senators) in New Mexico this year. It is said that he does not have much chance, because Hurley's opponent is former Secretary of Agriculture Anderson. Anderson is also from New Mexico and a Democratic Party member with status, while Hurley belongs to the Republican Party.</p>
<p>The number of members in the state Senate and House of Representatives is also related to the presidential election. This is because of the rigid provisions of the US "written constitution." The United States is a federal republic, so in theory, the citizens of each state can only elect the "presidential electors" of each state, and then the "electors" of each state elect the federal President. This system was established at the beginning of the founding of the United States—in 1787—and has not been abolished to this day.</p>
<p>After the rise of party politics, it seems more convenient for the people to directly elect the President than through indirect elections. Therefore, in 1808, all parties in the United States unanimously agreed that the "presidential electors" of each state should be divided into groups according to their party affiliation, and collectively elected or defeated. For example, according to the constitution, New York State has forty-seven "presidential electors." The Democratic Party nominates forty-seven names, and the Republican Party also nominates forty-seven names. If the people of New York State mostly vote for Dewey, it means that the Republican Party's forty-seven "presidential electors" have been elected by the people. Then, the "presidential electors" elected by each state vote for the federal government on a certain day in the middle of December (stipulated as the "Monday" after the second "Wednesday" in December) to formally elect the federal President and Vice President. This procedure was originally clumsy and redundant, but because it is a constitutional tradition, it has never been amended.</p>
<p>The number of "presidential electors" in each state is equivalent to the sum of the number of members in the state Senate and House of Representatives. For example, New York State has two senators and forty-five representatives, so it has forty-seven "presidential electors." Michigan has two senators and seventeen representatives, so it can produce nineteen "presidential electors." Nevada has two senators and one representative, so Nevada can produce three "presidential electors." There are a total of ninety-six senators and four hundred and thirty-five representatives in the United States, so there are a total of five hundred and thirty-one "presidential electors" in the United States.</p>
<p>To be elected President and Vice President, you must have more than half of the votes of the "presidential electors" (two hundred and sixty-six votes). Therefore, in the election arena, controlling large states and neglecting small states is a necessary strategy. In 1944, Dewey and Roosevelt competed in the election. In the sum of the popular vote, Roosevelt won fifty-five percent and Dewey forty-five percent. However, in the votes of the "presidential electors," Roosevelt alone won eighty-four percent. The former ratio only represents the degree of popular support, while the latter ratio represents the legal record. Roosevelt was the person most proficient in election thresholds. Now, Roosevelt has long been sleeping in the ground, and Roosevelt's former election rival is now standing opposite the Democratic Party. (Written on October 12 in Uptown New York)</p>

However, in some places, if the prices between the production and sales areas are not balanced, reasonable adjustments may be made, all based on Shanghai's "August 19" price limit, and the pricing will be increased or decreased according to commercial practices in order to ensure smooth freight transportation. A plan for increasing or decreasing prices will be discussed and submitted for approval within one week. (2) In order to ensure smooth material circulation between rural and urban areas, each county should establish a material adjustment office to quickly collect statistics on the quantity of industrial products such as yarn, cloth, sugar, soap, and matches required by the county, and the types and quantities of materials that the county can supply, and report them to the supervisor's office for guidance on transactions. Farmers who sell their products at the limited price should be allowed to purchase industrial products at the limited price. (3) Each county should pay close attention to cracking down on hoarding of agricultural products in rural areas. If it is found that the quantity exceeds the quantity for self-use, it should be forced to supply the market. (4) Each province, county, city, and township is not allowed to act independently and block the flow of goods. Existing bans should be canceled immediately. (5) Counties near bandit areas should pay attention to strict blockades and not allow materials to flow into bandit areas. (6) Each county should pay attention to cracking down on black market transactions at any time, and black markets for gold and banknotes must be strictly prohibited.</p>

<h3>Cotton Yarn Shop Fraud Discovered; Attempting to Report More with Less; Manager Detained in Police Station</h3>
<p>Yesterday morning at 7:00 a.m., Chen Zhenlin of Hongxing Cotton Cloth Factory at No. 92 Yaojiazhai, Hongqiao Road, went to Jinling Middle Road to line up at Yepin Cotton Yarn Shop to purchase cotton yarn, and was numbered 71. He purchased five small bundles of ten-count yarn, and the invoice was filled in as ten small bundles (that is, half a package). He instructed the factory stamp of Hongxing Cotton Cloth Factory to be stamped on the back of the invoice stub as a basis, hoping to report less with more and strive for yarn allocation from the China Textile Company in order to seek huge profits. Chen Zhenlin discovered this and seized the account book, and immediately reported to traffic policeman Zhao Haixu No. 3501. He checked the invoice stubs from No. 1 to No. 70 on the spot. Each person purchased five small bundles, and the invoice stubs were filled in as half a small package. At that time, there were also queue purchasers Zhang Ming (resident of No. 3 Xinhongqiao Road), Ji Guoying No. 28 (resident of No. 14 Zhao Jiazhai, Xietu Road North), Zhou Keji No. 100 (resident of Taichang Knitting Factory No. 23, Zhizaoju Road), and Sun Jinyuan No. 90 (resident of Civic Village No. 395, Hongqiao Road) and others testifying on the spot.

<h3>Trial Begins in the Case of the Secretary-General of the Women and Children's Association Accused of False Accusation</h3>
<p>Rescheduled to Review Counterclaim and Interrogate Again</p>
<p>[Report from this Newspaper] Ding Hao, the accounting director of the China Women and Children Relief Association, previously accused Zhou Naihao, the secretary-general of the association, of "forging documents" and "embezzlement" at the District Procuratorate. During the investigation at the District Procuratorate, the bureau filed a counterclaim against Ding, stating that Ding's behavior was improper and that he was suspected of drug use.

Regarding the false accusation part, Judge Zhu Huaping of the District Court opened the trial yesterday morning. Zhou appeared in court and stated: He did not accuse Ding of drug use at the District Procuratorate. In the plea, he only stated that Ding's behavior was improper, and the mention of opium use was only for the prosecutor's reference. He also gave a statement regarding the claim of Ding's opium use. The court stated that it was necessary to review the counterclaim that Zhou filed with the District Procuratorate and adjourned the hearing.</p>
<h3>Reduced Portions of Meals and Dishes; Diners Mostly Unable to Eat Their Fill; Restaurant Industry Asks for Guidance on Food Supply</h3>
<p>[Report from this Newspaper] The panic faced by restaurants in the city due to the difficulty of purchasing rice, oil, and vegetables is becoming increasingly serious. Up to now, more than 40 restaurants that are members of the Wine and Dish Industry Association have officially announced their closure. It is reported that dozens of other restaurants have requested the association for a temporary suspension of business. Because most of the small restaurants that previously specialized in lunch and dinner sets have stopped supplying them, the larger restaurants are extremely crowded during lunch and dinner hours every day, and more than 70% of their business is set meals. However, because the quantity of rice and vegetables purchased every day is limited, they have gradually shortened business hours or reduced the portions of meals. Now, ordinary lunches are all sold out at around 1:00 p.m., and dinners are all sold out at around 8:00 p.m. The portion of set meals is reduced by about one-third compared to before. Even the pork and beef steaks in Western restaurants are only the size of a handful, and there is often meat without vegetables or vegetables without soup, which diners find difficult to endure. According to the Chinese and Western Restaurant Industry Association, unless the difficulty in obtaining food ingredients can be resolved, this situation will be difficult to improve for a while. If they apply for a purchase certificate from the Social Bureau and go to the producing areas in other places to purchase large quantities, their business can barely be maintained. However, at present, various counties in other places have strict control over food materials, and it is difficult to transport large quantities out of the territory. Therefore, it is hoped that the authorities will find a solution as soon as possible or directly contact the producing areas to ensure an adequate supply and restore normal supply conditions.</p>
<h3>Authorities Discuss Price Control Issues; Unanimously Agree That Production Must Be Maintained</h3>
<p>[Report from this Newspaper] Yesterday afternoon at 3:00 p.m., Mayor Wu, Commander Xuan, Speaker Pan, Chairman Fang, Director Wu Kaixian, Supervisor Jiang, Xu Jiqing, and other seven people held a discussion at the Central Bank Supervisor's Office to solemnly discuss the increasingly difficult price control problem. As a result of the exchange of opinions, it was unanimously agreed that production must be maintained and that manufacturers should be able to have legal profits. The sources of grain and coal have been resolved. The rationing system for November has been decided to be implemented in order to stabilize people's livelihood, but the household registration still needs to be re-investigated. There is still a large stock of daily necessities in Shanghai, and it is believed that there will be no panic. It is hoped that the citizens will be at ease and will not disturb each other. After the meeting, according to the spokesman of the Supervisor's Office: the detailed method of rationing is still to be formulated, probably first rationing rice and coal, using household registration as the unit. There is no problem with the source of rice and coal.</p>
<h3>Prices of Newly Released Cigarettes and Soaps Should be Submitted to the Social Bureau for Approval</h3>
<p>[Report from this Newspaper] The Social Bureau has strictly ordered all manufacturers that if there are newly released cigarettes, soaps, and fragrant soaps that have been released on the market after August 19, they must first send the product name, the proposed selling price, and samples to the bureau. The Social Bureau will then coordinate with the heads of the relevant trade associations to approve the price according to the competitive ratio and the same level of goods before they are allowed to be sold. Otherwise, they will be banned.</p>
<h3>No Cigarettes on the Market; Merchants and Factories Push Responsibility; Decision to First Implement Temporary Measures</h3>
<p>Cheng Yikuan, the captain of the Anti-Smuggling Brigade, held a meeting of cigarette manufacturers at the General Bureau of Superintendence yesterday morning at 10:30 a.m., attended by Yao Shukun and Zhang Yuwen, the executive directors of the Cigarette Industry Association, Weng Ziyou, the chairman of the Cigarette Industry Association, Ye Jiru, the executive director, Chen Taiqiu (Yongkang Company), Lu Jialiang (Tianxing Heji), representatives of Chinese tobacco shops and retailers, and representatives of Yizhong Tobacco Company. First, Weng Ye and others from the Cigarette Industry Association reported that there were no cigarettes on the market recently, and it was not that wholesalers intentionally raised market prices, hoping to break through the limited price, but that there was no distribution of goods, and the actual responsibility should be borne by the manufacturers. Then, the manufacturers put forward various reasons to explain the lack of distribution of goods. After listening to the opinions of all parties, Captain Cheng decided that the two temporary measures stipulated last Saturday should be implemented first, and the detailed measures should be drafted and improved by the units present. According to wholesalers, Yizhong Company has decided to postpone the new distribution of goods until now.</p>
<h3>Trial Court Interrogates Huang Yuanjue in the Sanwei Company Foreign Exchange Speculation Case</h3>
<p>In the Sanwei Company's private foreign exchange speculation case, which was busted at the same time as the Linwang Company, Judge Wang Zhennan personally opened the court yesterday afternoon and interrogated the defendant Huang Yuanjue (manager of the foreign trade department of Sanwei Company) because Yu Shunwei, the person in charge of the company and the main character of the case, was still at large and the case had not been concluded. He ordered Yu Shunwei to come to court as soon as possible, and the case was rescheduled for trial.</p>
<h3>Three Shops of Laundry and Dyeing Workers Once Went on Strike</h3>
<p>Social Bureau Decides to Mediate on Trial Today</p>
<p>Workers in the laundry and dyeing department of the branch shops of Zhengzhang, Verdun, and other three laundry and dyeing shops in this city had a dispute with the employers over the issue of the payday. The workers of each shop once went on strike the day before yesterday. After persuasion by the Society and personnel sent by the industry trade union, the normal state was restored immediately. It is learned that the Society will convene representatives of both labor and management today to try to mediate.</p>

A total of 1,768 bottles were received by Zhongshan, Sino-American, Hongren, Gongji, Shengxin, Siming Women and Children, Hudong, and Shanghai Plague Hospitals, worth more than 15,000 gold yuan.</p>
<h3>Distribution of Coal Briquettes for Public and Religious Personnel in September Decided to Start Tomorrow</h3>
<p>The distribution of coal briquettes for public and religious personnel in September was delayed because the former Fuel Management Committee was abolished and the Tobacco and Coal Regulation and Supply Office was not yet established. It is now learned that the office has decided to first issue the difference money on the 19th of this month and distribute coal briquettes from the 20th. The procedures and locations for collecting the difference money and coal briquettes are the same as last month, and the deadline has been extended to the 30th of this month.</p>
<h3>Jewelry Lottery: Rumors of a Black Market, Sold Out Immediately After Issuance, Senior Official Requests Early Drawing</h3>
<p>[Our Report] The jewelry lottery, just announced for sale on the 15th, has already been completely sold out by the Central Trust of China (CTC) Bureau and its various sales agencies. Although some lottery ticket shops in the city still have a small amount available, lines of eager buyers have also appeared in front of their doors. The fervor of the buyers is no different from the initial rush to buy daily necessities like rice and oil. The total number of these lottery tickets is only 600,000, and they must be distributed throughout the country, with Shanghai only receiving 200,000 to 300,000 tickets. Each ticket sells for only 50 cents, but it is said that many people are buying them in bulk, and there are even rumors of a black market where the price is at least double the face value. Officials at the CTC's Central Savings Society (CSS) have expressed surprise at the lottery's popularity. Originally scheduled to be issued every two months, the first issue was sold out in just two days, so the original drawing date of December 10th is being considered for advancement with a request to the Ministry of Finance. The prizes for the first issue are worth a total of 120,000 yuan. The CTC hired experts to estimate the reserve price of these jewelry prizes as early as February of this year. This time, for the issuance of the lottery, they hired jewelry experts in the city to re-estimate the value after the currency reform, according to the market value at the time. More than a month has passed since then, and it is generally estimated that the market value of these prizes is increasing daily, which has doubled the interest of the buyers. Yesterday, reporters inquired with the CSS about the issuance of the lottery. According to them, based on the regulations of the Ministry of Finance, the lottery sales agencies are divided into two types: special and default. Default agencies refer to national banks and bureaus. Their distribution is as follows: CSS 59,000 tickets, CTC 35,000 tickets, Bank of China 25,000 tickets, Postal Remittances Bureau 10,000 tickets, Communications Bank 5,000 tickets. Special agencies are contracted by five experienced firms to handle sales in various regions across the country. The Beijing-Shanghai-Hangzhou region is contracted by Shile Trading Company, with a total of 240,000 tickets. The Sichuan-Guizhou-Hunan-Hubei region is contracted by Dadao Industrial Company, with a total of 65,000 tickets. The Pingjin region is contracted by Jinhua Company, with a total of 20,000 tickets. The Shaanxi-Gansu-Qinghai region is contracted by Chen Bainian, with a total of 40,000 tickets. The Anhui region is contracted by Xinye Company, with a total of 10,000 tickets. In addition, the Shanghai Jewelry Industry Association has also contracted 50,000 tickets.</p>
<h3>Current Residents of Enemy and Puppet Houses: Executive Yuan Approves Status</h3>
<p>The Suzhou-Zhejiang-Anhui Area Enemy and Puppet Property Clearance Office had doubts about the term "current residents" when selling enemy and puppet seized properties. The Executive Yuan has now approved the status of "current residents," and the Secretariat of the Yuan has notified the Municipal Government for public announcement: (1) The term "current resident" refers to the following situations: 1. Residents whose use has been approved by the Yuan and who have resided for eight years are considered current residents. 2. If the same house has been approved by the Yuan for use by two or more residents, and they have already moved in, they are considered current residents. 3. Current users who have moved in on their own are considered current residents. 4. Those originally approved by the Yuan for custody and use by various agencies, organizations, and schools, even if their staff members reside in them, are still considered current residents as the agencies, organizations, and schools. (2) If the same house is currently occupied by multiple residents, they should be notified to negotiate within ten days, with one of them purchasing it, or applying for purchase jointly. If they fail to purchase it within the time limit, it will be considered abandonment, and it will be publicly auctioned. (3) For those who reside in the houses of traitors, and who have paid repair costs approved on record before the promulgation of the Yuan's Measures for the Custody and Use of Houses of Traitors, they should be fairly compensated at the time of disposal, to the extent of the existing benefits due to the repairs.</p>
<h3>Citizens Prepare Photos Early: New Identification Cards to be Distributed Soon, Citywide Census to be Held on the 28th</h3>
<p>[Our Report] Regarding the implementation of a comprehensive rationing system and the issuance of new national identification cards in this city, the concrete principles have been determined recently under the active preparation of the authorities. This time, the new national identification cards will be printed in conjunction with the rationing certificates. The format has been drafted by the Civil Affairs Bureau and will be submitted for approval before being delivered to the Central Printing Factory to be completed before the 28th of this month. A citywide census is scheduled to be held from the 28th to the 31st. The new national identification cards will be distributed to each household in advance by the district and bao leaders before the census. Citizens should fill them out according to the format, paste photos, and keep them themselves. At that time, census personnel will visit each household for review and collection. After compiling, verifying, and stamping them, they will be redistributed to each household by the baojia leaders for collection. The stamping and redistribution work is scheduled to be completed before November 5th. Yesterday, the Civil Affairs Bureau ordered each district and bao to inform citizens to prepare photos as soon as possible. The Social Bureau has also strictly ordered the Photographic Industry Association to inform all photo studios to abide by the "August 19th" price limit and not to raise prices opportunistically. In order to urge the swift progress of this matter, the authorities have specially formed a Preparatory Committee for Census and Issuance of Identification Cards and Rationing Certificates, comprising the Supervisory Office, the Municipal Government's Social, Civil, Police, and Education Bureaus, the Garrison Command, the Military Police Corps, and the Civil Survey Committee, to actively promote it. It has now been decided to set up temporary supervisors by district, with jia as the census unit. Each jia will have two census takers, and the city's more than 28,000 jia will require 56,000 census takers. Therefore, this census and verification work will mobilize 70,000 people, including existing baojia personnel and the Youth Service Team of the Construction Corps. At the time of the census, it is planned to implement a "static census" in the early morning. Traffic will be controlled throughout the city at the same time, with an estimated 10,000 military police mobilized for traffic control. The total budget is 500,000 Gold Yuan, which will be temporarily allocated by the Municipal Government, including about 300,000 yuan for printing the national identification cards with rationing certificates. Therefore, a processing fee will be charged for the new cards.</p>

<p>[Our Report] The Social Bureau began processing applications for flour rationing for the bun and steamed bread industry yesterday, and over 3,000 application forms were issued in one day.

Qualified applicants will be issued a flour collection certificate, which can be used to pay and collect flour at designated locations.

(3) After each shop and stall obtains the flour collection certificate, it should pay and collect flour at the payment location designated by the Flour Association. The aforementioned payment and collection matters can be handled by district. (4) The quantity and quality of flour will be determined by the Social Bureau from time to time according to the production situation, and will be supplied by the Flour Association by district. (5) Personnel will be dispatched to conduct spot checks on each shop and stall receiving flour.

<h3>Limited Gasoline Surplus: Only Enough for 600 Vehicles, Automobile Conservation Meeting to be Held Today, Re-examine Fuel Allocation Standards</h3>
<p>The Municipal Automobile Gasoline Conservation Review Committee is scheduled to hold a review panel meeting at the Municipal Government at 3:00 PM today. It is reported that the meeting will re-examine the applications for additional gasoline allocations from those who only qualify for the basic allocation of ten gallons due to their status not meeting the regulations for private automobiles, and will determine the standards for vehicles that should be granted additional gasoline. However, according to the person in charge of the Committee, the remaining gasoline allocated to the city this month, excluding industrial and special allocations (such as for garrison vehicles, fire trucks, and ambulances), is only enough to supply 600 automobiles (calculated at the regulated amount of 50 gallons per vehicle). There are already 270 physicians who have been approved as eligible for automobile use according to central regulations, and after adding the gasoline allocated for the vehicles of heads of various agencies, the remaining amount is extremely limited. There are currently over 1,000 applicants for additional gasoline allocations, so the Municipal Government will implement absolutely strict regulations on gasoline allocation standards, and it may not be possible to grant additional gasoline allocations even for the vehicles of senators, National Assembly representatives, and Legislative Yuan members.</p>
<h3>Li Ruiying Prosecuted for Murder in Traitor Case</h3>
<p>[Our Report] Li Ruiying, a native of Wujin, previously worked as a special agent in the Wujin Loyal National Salvation Army. In June of the 31st year of the Republic (1942), he was captured and imprisoned by enemy forces in Sanhekou, outside the North Gate of Wujin. He was later released on bail by his teacher, Ju Huanzhang, and defected to the enemy, serving as a detective in the Wujin County Government.

<h3>Over 2,000 Tons of Copper-Nickel Coins: Hai Liao Ship Arrives from Japan, Hold Converted to Transport Returning Coins, Over 2,000 Tons of Copper-Nickel Coins</h3>
<p>[Our Report] The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Hai Liao ship arrived from Osaka with over 2,000 tons of returned copper-nickel coins, including 2,144 boxes of nickel coins and 234 boxes of copper coins. There were also 15 boxes of bartered goods electrical equipment and 230 boxes of rayon, as well as 70 returning overseas Chinese. The ship arrived in Shanghai at noon yesterday and berthed at the Huangpu Wharf for unloading. The ship is scheduled to continue to Kobe next Tuesday to unload bartered goods. Because the bartered goods need to be loaded with bulk tung oil, the ship plans to convert the cargo hold, and it is expected to convert three holds. Before this export, one hold was first loaded, so it can only load 120 tons of oil. When it is exported next time, all of it can be loaded, and it can hold 250 tons. The Hai Liao ship is a pioneer in transporting bulk tung oil to foreign countries. It is also learned that the copper-nickel coins to be transported back by the ship next time will be loaded in Nagoya.</p>

<h3>Perpetrators in Customs Bribery Case Escorted to Second Detention Center in Nanjing</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 18th] Since the judgments of death sentences for Yin Lansun, Yue Xinmin, and Zhang Yuan in the Jianghai Customs bribery case were delivered, all three have separately applied for retrial according to law.

<h3>Workers from Clothing Factory Cause Trouble on Trolley: Engage in Vicious Fight with Driver and Conductor on Changshou Road, Qiu Changjiang Injured While Mediating, Multiple Injuries, Four Suspects Arrested on the Spot</h3>
<p>[Our Report] At around 9:15 PM last night, three workers from the Shanghai Clothing General Factory of the Joint Logistics Headquarters, numbered "10.2289" and others, took an British No. 16 trolley from Carter Road back to the factory. They got into an argument with the conductor, No. 536, for not buying tickets. When the trolley arrived at the Changshou Road Great Bell at the entrance of the Juyuan Restaurant, a fight broke out between the two sides. More and more workers from the clothing factory gathered, and the order became chaotic, causing traffic congestion. British and French trolleys No. 24 and No. 16 arrived one after another, and the drivers and conductors gradually joined the battle, making the situation serious. At that time, the authorities of the Clothing General Factory reported the incident and urgently dispatched the guard team to suppress it, but it was ineffective. Then they ordered Section Chief He and Director Zhang and others to rush to persuade the workers, but it was also ineffective. At the same time, Qiu Changjiang, the chairman of the British Trolley Workers' Union, personally rushed to the scene after hearing the report. While he was negotiating with the responsible party of the factory, he was stabbed with scissors by the opposing workers. In addition, the injured in the melee included the ticket inspector of French No. 824, the conductor of British No. 536, the driver of British No. 131, and another driver, Yan Fenghua. Two people from the clothing factory, numbered 16106 and 16474, were injured and sent to the Labor Hospital by the police. At the same time, Police Officer No. 2915 of the Putuo Road Police Station was also beaten indiscriminately while passing by, and has been sent to the Police Hospital for treatment. Afterwards, Shen Deheng, the chief of the Putuo Road Police Station in charge, rushed to the scene with Section Chief Zhu and a large number of police officers to suppress the situation after hearing the news. He arrested four workers involved in the incident on the spot, including Xie Jianqiu, Wang Yonghe, Sang Xingye, and Li Xizhong. The flying fortresses of the First Guard Team Headquarters also rushed to the scene one after another and found weapons used in the assault, such as knives, scissors, and stones, which were taken back to the police station along with the suspects. The arrested suspects are being interrogated overnight. Those with military status are planned to be transferred to the Garrison Command for investigation, while those who are confirmed to be workers will be sent to the judicial organs. After the incident, Zhou, the director of the Clothing Factory, personally went to the Putuo Police Station to express his condolences for the injury of Qiu Changjiang. Both sides expressed their willingness to settle the matter peacefully. As for the main offenders, Director Zhou will be responsible for handing them over for punishment according to law, and the medical expenses of the injured drivers and conductors will also be compensated by the factory. The two sides, together with the military and police authorities, began negotiations, which were still continuing at 1:30 AM this morning.</p>
<h3>National Grain Federation Calls for Exemption of Grain Business Tax</h3>
<p>Wan Molin, Chairman of the National Grain Federation, recently sent telegrams to all national public opinion organs, asking them for support for the Federation's continued request for exemption of grain business tax, urging the Legislative Yuan to quickly review and approve it, so as to emphasize the importance of people's food. According to the telegram, the Grain Policy Committee of the Legislative Yuan has carefully studied the case of exemption of grain business tax and has already drafted a written report. It was also submitted for discussion at the tenth general meeting of the Yuan. The report listed a total of six reasons for exempting grain tax, believing that the rice tax must be paid at every level from rural areas to all cities, which has a great impact on rural areas, and may cause the phenomenon of grain being cheap and harming farmers or grain being expensive and harming the people. Moreover, the tax is a local tax with each administration acting on its own, which easily fosters the abuse of local exactions and continued collection. Finally, it proposed to change the method of grain collection to a one-time unified tax, the method being: (1) Restore the flour unified tax. (2) Levy a rice unified tax in accordance with the flour unified tax. (3) The unified tax should be limited to rice and flour. Other salt, flour, and miscellaneous grains will be exempt from tax and allowed to circulate freely when unprocessed. (4) The unified tax should be collected at rice mills, flour factories, and flour mills. (5) The unified tax can be sold back to the local government and belong to the local tax, but the tax rate and collection method should be in accordance with the central regulations.</p>
<h3>Chairman of Sugar Industry Association and Others Transferred to Special Criminal Court for Trial</h3>
<p>[Our Report] Zheng Yiju, Chairman of the Shanghai Sugar Industry Association, and Secretary Zhu Guoming were summoned and detained by the Supervisory Office's Inspection Team for allegedly manipulating sugar prices and hoarding for profit. They were subsequently transferred to the District Procuratorate for investigation. Because the case falls under the jurisdiction of the Special Criminal Court, the District Procuratorate transferred it to the Special Criminal Court for trial yesterday.

<h3>Old Woman and Son-in-Law Prosecuted for Blood Transfusion Fraud</h3>

She also introduced Cai Zhimao to the Zhongshan Hospital to transfuse 400 cc of blood, with a price of 57 million yuan, but only paid Cai 33 million yuan. Such fraudulent and deducted incidents are numerous. Zhu, her son-in-law, assisted Guan in her affairs. Once, Zhang Xinmin discovered Guan's fraud, but Zhu still forced him to go for a blood transfusion and beat him, and the case was reported to the police and investigated, and then sent to the District Procuratorate.</p>
<h3>Lawyer's Trolley "Adventure": Ticket Snatched, Lawsuit Filed</h3>
<p>[Our Report] Lawyer Wen Ren'an recently filed a private prosecution with the District Court, accusing Zhu Huiming, a conductor of the British Trolley Company, of robbery. The District Court held a hearing yesterday and ordered a retrial on the afternoon of the 25th. According to Wen's complaint, at 11:25 AM on September 3rd, he got off the bus from the Shanhai Pass Road Station to the Xinzha Road Station. He was already ten steps away from the station when the defendant followed him, snatched his document bag, blocked his way, and said, "I know you never buy tickets when you take the bus. Even if you are the president of the court today, you must buy a ticket. The day before yesterday at 6 PM on Seymour Road, I also checked a person from the court. He had a court badge, I told him to buy a ticket, but he didn't, so I sent him to the Jing'an Temple Medical Inspection Bureau. If you don't buy a ticket today, I won't be polite to you either." He explained to the defendant that he had purchased a monthly ticket, and whether the court personnel purchased tickets or not had nothing to do with him. The defendant ignored him and still snatched his monthly ticket. Wen believes that the defendant has seriously violated the company's rules and regulations, making him do things that are not his duty, so he filed a private prosecution.</p>

<h3>Capital Outflow Tightens Credit, Market Interest Rates Continue to Rise, Capital Flight to the South Becomes Severe Again, Authorities Consider Curbing Measures</h3>
<p>Yesterday, credit remained tight, and market interest rates soared to 0.9% to 1.5% per month. Long-term call loans even reached as high as 3% or more, which is unprecedented since the change of government. The cash panic is increasing daily. It is reported that before last month, the interest rate on cash call loans in the market was higher than that on promissory notes. The increased redundancy in the exchange of promissory notes in the city these days is a clear indication of this. It is also reported that large banknotes of 50 and 100 yuan are being discounted, and shipping companies are urgently seeking them. Due to the tight credit situation, banks and money houses have no overnight balances to deposit in the Central Bank. According to regulations, they cannot withdraw cash the next day, so credit within the industry has been extremely tight in recent days. Withdrawal limits for customers are extremely strict. Large banks are only allocating 1,000 or 2,000 yuan per account, and small banks are only allocating 500 yuan, or even 200 yuan.</p>
<p>[United Credit Reporting Agency] The outflow of capital to the south and to Hong Kong has recently become dangerously rampant again. Although the Ministry of Finance and the Guangzhou management authorities have repeatedly tried to curb it, the trend has not abated. The government will take emergency measures to severely crack down on it. Currently, funds flowing south are transferred in two ways: remittances and physical transport. Remittances are currently under control, with the total amount of remittances paid by paying banks limited to 200,000 yuan per day. Aircraft and ships are also being closely inspected for physical transport. However, the current difficulty is that some remittances are being transferred through counties near Guangzhou. Furthermore, it is not easy to thoroughly inspect the Guangdong-Hankou Railway for physical transport. Therefore, the government is now taking effective measures to address this and is determined to restrict it. It is reported that after the capital flows south, most of it is used to purchase goods, buy foreign currency and gold in Guangzhou, which greatly affects the black market for foreign exchange.</p>
<p>[Another Report] According to financial authorities yesterday morning, the problem of capital flight to Hong Kong has become severe again. Although the Economic Control Supervisory Office has strictly ordered investigations and interceptions, this phenomenon has not been eradicated. It is reported that the government is considering further discussions with the Hong Kong government in order to completely eradicate this situation. It is hoped that Hong Kong will assist in preventing the outflow of domestic capital to Hong Kong in the spirit of the Sino-British agreement.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Finance Announces Exchange Procedures for 29th and 30th Year Military Bonds</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] Regarding whether the 29th and 30th year military bonds are still allowed to be exchanged and how to handle early debt repayment, the National Treasury Bureau of the National Bank has received a telegram from the Ministry of Finance stating: "Regarding the 29th year military bonds, if someone still wishes to exchange them, they may be allowed to do so. If it is a receipt for the military bond, it should first be verified whether there are suitable bonds in the Ministry's custodial account that can be allocated. If there are no such bonds in the custodial account, the holder of the receipt should be instructed to send the receipt directly to the Ministry for verification. As for those who previously purchased the 29th year military bonds and were issued the 30th year military bonds due to insufficient small denominations, when the bondholder applies for repayment in accordance with the procedures promulgated by the Executive Yuan, there is no need to investigate the reason for holding the bond. Repayment will be handled in accordance with the regulations and the double standard for the bond held."</p>

<h3>Intensified Crackdown on Black Market, Cotton Cloth Sold as Usual</h3>

The price of six-count auxiliary Sunlight coarse yarn in a straw bale was 255 gold yuan, the price of 20-count Cai Kuixing in a large bale was 700 yuan, the price of 15-count Fengnian in a straw bale was 573 yuan, and the price of 23-count Sunlight in a cone was 778 yuan.

The various coarse and fine yarns offered were limited to dyeing and weaving industries groups C and F and towel, quilt, and electric weaving industries for purchasing 20-count yarn; dyeing and weaving industries groups A, B, C, and D for purchasing 23-count yarn; towel, quilt, blanket, and dyeing and weaving industries groups A, B, C, and D, as well as electric weaving socks and vegetables, for purchasing 15-count yarn; electric weaving industries for purchasing 40-count yarn; and electric weaving socks and mercerized groups for purchasing 42-count yarn.</p>
<p>The cotton cloth market is currently suspended by order, and the authorities are intensifying their crackdown on the off-market black market. Yesterday morning around 8 o'clock, brokers at the Paradise Tea House were investigated and dealt with, and the off-market shouts were immediately silenced.</p>
<p>It is also reported that the Cotton Cloth Business Association yesterday afternoon temporarily distributed the third phase, first batch of more than 80 types of cotton cloth from private yarn factories to dyeing and weaving industries. Due to the limited amount of cloth, supplies to wholesalers were temporarily suspended and only distributed to retailers, totaling 11,980 pieces distributed. It is reported that the second batch of cloth for the third phase has been decided and will consist of line tweed, velvet cloth, and quilt cloth, totaling more than 15,000 pieces.</p>
<h3>Sluggish Silk Market</h3>
<p>The raw silk market remains stagnant, with no transactions in the market. The quantity distributed by the guild is still small, and applicants still feel it is insufficient. Sales at silk shops are still slow, and the trend remains firm, but due to quantity restrictions, most have no goods to sell. Raw silk transactions have not yet started, and holders are watching, with demand exceeding supply in the market.</p>
<p>Due to the depletion of raw materials, the supply of existing silk fabrics is also scarce. More and more customers from other regions are coming to Shanghai to add to their businesses, but factories are not opening up many goods, and most have no goods to buy, so transactions remain extremely sluggish.</p>
<h3>Quiet Overseas Sales of Chinese Tea</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] According to authoritative sources in the Chinese tea export industry: Currently, Africa is quite fond of Tunlv and other teas, but because tea merchants there have already used up the foreign exchange recently allocated by their regulatory authorities, they must wait for the next round of allocations before they can start importing again. Therefore, overseas sales of Chinese tea have gradually declined and become quiet. However, holders are generally maintaining a steady attitude amidst the scarcity of both production and inventory, and the underlying market remains strong. As for Qimen black tea, the United Kingdom still intends to import it, but unfortunately, the prices are suppressed, so exports are also minimal. As for domestic sales tea, the Tianjin market is still lacking movement due to transportation issues. However, Taicang and the Suzhou-Wuxi-Changzhou area each have sales, and market sentiment is generally stable.</p>
<h3>Rice Arrivals Become Active, More Than 3,800 Stone Arrive in the North and South Markets Yesterday</h3>
<p>Rice purchased by traders from various regions is arriving in the city one after another. Yesterday, the South Market registered 831 stone arriving for dealers and factories, and 624 stone for rice shops. The North Market registered 1,297 stone arriving for dealers, 492 stone for rice shops, 150 stone for rice factories, and 448 stone self-managed by non-industry members (totaling 2,387 stone). The total arrival of goods in the two markets was 3,842 stone. Most of the above arrivals are directly supplied to retail outlets, so transactions in the market remain sparse. The South Market has prices for white japonica rice, thin japonica rice, Yangxian rice, Duxian rice, and Baiyuan rice.</p>
<p>No transactions in flour.</p>
<p>The grain market is dead. Soybeans, corn, Yuan wheat, etc. were not open. Only a small amount of sesame was sold. 20 bags of Poyang Snow Sesame were traded at 30 yuan, two bags per household. 300 bags of Kaifeng raw peanuts were opened by Ti Zhuang and sold to Xiaoyingfang at 32.7 yuan.</p>
<h3>Continued Studies and Return to Country for Self-Funded Overseas Students, Application and Repayment Methods for Loans, Ministry of Education Sends Letters to Relevant Embassies Hoping Students' Parents Prepare to Apply for Loans</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 18th] The Ministry of Education has decided to extend the loan assistance program for self-funded students studying abroad and the deadline for subsidies for return travel expenses to the end of February next year. The Ministry of Education has forwarded this program to relevant embassies in the United States, Britain, France, Switzerland, Canada, and other countries for handling, and the application and repayment methods for loans are agreed as follows: (1) Loan: A one-time loan of half the half-year living expenses, 450 US dollars, and the remaining half will be purchased at the statutory exchange rate, limited to one time. (2) A. Self-funded students who have been admitted and meet the following conditions may apply for a loan. Zi: Self-funded students who have been admitted by the Ministry of Education and have been studying at a foreign university and can complete one year of study before the end of February 38, and are willing to return to China at that time. Chou: Those who have not yet received the second installment of living expenses in foreign exchange. Yin: Those who are from poor families and are unable to purchase all foreign exchange for tuition and living expenses at the new exchange rate, and whose local embassy or consulate has verified that they are eligible to repay the entire loan within three years after returning to China. B. If any of the following two situations occur, in addition to repaying the loan and paying the interest due on the loan, the right to apply for travel expense subsidies will be cancelled. Zi: Those who are from relatively wealthy families and falsely report that they are unable to continue studying or unable to return to China, and are found to be true after investigation. Chou: Those who fail the course. (3) The repayment date is from April 38 to March 41, within a three-year period, repaid in full or in installments, converted into gold yuan at the statutory exchange rate at that time, and handed over to the Central Bank. (4) Guarantee methods: A. Store guarantee: Chinese merchants at home and abroad shall guarantee in their names. If the borrower is unable to repay, the merchant shall bear unlimited liability. B. Personal guarantee: Citizens of China at home and abroad are acceptable. They must have a proper occupation and have a fixed salary income sufficient to repay the loan, and must be formally certified by the employing agency or company. If the borrower is unable to repay, the guarantor shall bear full responsibility. According to the spokesperson of the Ministry of Education: Because the personal store guarantee must be for Chinese citizens at home and abroad, and students are now abroad to save time, it is hoped that parents and relatives of students who are eligible to apply for loans will make the necessary preparations immediately, and hope to get in touch with the students so that the loan application can proceed quickly.</p>
<h3>Restoration of Original System at Beiping Normal University is Based on University Law Regulations</h3>
<p>Spokesperson of the Ministry of Education Discusses Approval Process</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 18th] The spokesperson of the Ministry of Education said: National Beiping Normal University moved to Xi'an at the beginning of the Anti-Japanese War and merged with other colleges to form Xi'an Provisional University, which was later reorganized. After the victory, due to the normal college system determined in the 28th year, it was renamed Beiping Normal College. After the change to the college, the alumni of the school repeatedly requested the restoration of the university. The Ministry has always attached great importance to its history and tradition, so in recent years, it has also repeatedly considered how to restore it in accordance with the law. If the normal school is to be renamed a university, in addition to the colleges of liberal arts and sciences related to normal education, other colleges cannot be added due to their different nature, so there cannot be three colleges in accordance with the law. (The College of Education was abolished early due to the normal school system) If it is changed to a regular university, it will not conform to the tradition of the college and lose its meaning. Recently, with the promulgation of the University Law, according to Article 4 of the new law, there are regulations that educational colleges established before the implementation of this law may continue to operate, and the Department of Education of Beiping Normal College is in fact the successor to the College of Education of the old Beiping Normal University, and may restore its original name and continue to operate in accordance with the law. The courses of the normal college are originally owned by the colleges of liberal arts and sciences of the university. If the colleges of liberal arts and sciences are set up separately, there is no inappropriateness. If the original College of Education is added, it has the scale of three colleges, which meets the provisions of the University Law that a university has three colleges, which cannot be compared with other normal colleges, and it can restore its university name. Over the past two years, the Ministry has repeatedly and carefully considered this issue, and has only recently been able to obtain this legal basis and approve the restoration, which was not easy.</p>

<h3>Law-Abiding People</h3>
<p>— Thunder</p>
<p>I happened to see two absolutely different but somewhat similar news items in the newspaper. The incidents both took place in Japan, so they can also be regarded as a snapshot of Japanese society after the war.</p>
<p>The first is about a law-abiding person who starved to death:</p>
<p>"Tokyo District Court Judge Deguchi Yoshitada starved to death because he strictly adhered to the food control law. His will stated: Although it is a bad law, it is still a law; therefore, I dare to fight the black market and starve to death!"</p>
<p>The other is about a lawbreaker who was sentenced to death by the court:</p>
<p>"Ito Kosuke, a 17-year-old from Fukuoka Prefecture, lived a vagrant life and was recently sentenced to death by the Nagoya Court for killing two elderly women and robbing them of their gold jewelry."</p>
<p>"A murderer dies," the laws of ancient and modern China and foreign countries are almost the same, so Ito Kosuke's death sentence is reasonable and normal. However, the problem is that the person sentenced to death is only an underage 17-year-old child, and has always lived a vagrant life, which has led to two different opinions. Because I am not a lawyer, I can't talk about this. But what is most thought-provoking is the absolutely illogical fact that "law-abiding people die." However, this is a definite fact!</p>
<p>If we rashly put forward the slogan "law-abiding people die," we will inevitably be regarded as idiots or even insane, because of course there will be no such provision in the laws of ancient and modern China and foreign countries. But now there is indeed a judge who died because of "law-abiding," although the location of the incident was defeated Japan. The reason why this incident in Japan spread is probably because the dead person was not a civilian but a judge, so it attracted more attention. In fact, in the vast universe, I don't know how many people have been overlooked who "died" because of "law-abiding"!</p>
<p>Not long ago, we heard a new interpretation of "orderly and reasonable." This is not humor but a miserable cry. "Those with gold bars have reason." Conversely, without gold bars, there is no reason. Since the adequacy of the reason is directly proportional to the gold bars, may I ask how many truly law-abiding people have gold bars? Therefore, my first conclusion is: Law-abiding people do not have gold bars.</p>
<p>Also not long ago, I don't know how many people made a fortune from the victory. This includes the "confiscating" officials, the speculative merchants, and the powerful families who competed with the people for profit. They were truly in all shapes and forms, with a myriad of colors. These are all law-breakers. Law-abiding people are at the mercy of others, cut to the point where they can't breathe, and even can't maintain a living standard below the line. Public officials and salaried people all belong to this category. Therefore, my second conclusion is: Law-abiding people cannot live.</p>
<p>Again, not long ago, there were many people who made a fortune from the national crisis. Their roles were also of this type, both in the free zone and in the occupied zone. Law-abiding people can only be manipulated by others. Therefore, my third conclusion is similar to the second: Law-abiding people can only eke out a living.</p>
<p>Not having gold bars seems to be unrelated to life, but being unable to live and eking out a living are much more serious. Because the second step of being unable to live and eking out a living hides death.</p>
<p>How many people are currently unable to live and eke out a living? There are no statistics yet. But it is true that there are many, which cannot be denied.</p>
<p>Being law-abiding is such a noble behavior, but its only outcome is poverty, hunger, cold, and death. This is a terrible irony. To those who are good at exploiting loopholes, Deguchi Yoshitada's spirit of abiding by the law even if it means dying is idiotic and stupid, and it is also a major blow to law-abiding people, because the facts have clearly stated its consequences, although this is only a small incident in Japan.</p>
<p>Laski put it well: Before people can live comfortably, they must first live. I hope that all officials will not forget this superficial but true truth! Moreover, we are after all a victorious nation.</p>
<h3>A Blink of an Eye</h3>
<p>— Lin</p>
<p>American scientists have attached a very small and light mirror to a person's upper eyelid. Then, using intermittent light, they illuminate the mirror once every hundredth of a second. This light reflects directly onto a photographic plate. Thus, the opening and closing of the person's upper eyelid is recorded on this photographic plate.</p>
<p>These scientists reached the following conclusions:</p>
<p>The average time taken for people to "blink" their eyes is four-tenths of a second - the upper eyelid takes five-hundredths of a second to close downwards; the upper eyelid remains down (i.e. the eye is closed) for fifteen-hundredths of a second; it takes two-tenths of a second for the upper eyelid to lift and return to its original position.</p>
<h3>Background</h3>
<p>— Nanwu</p>
<p>When a few friends are chatting, and they happen to mention a person of some fame or status, there's often someone who puts on a mysterious smile and says, "So-and-so? Do you know what their background is?" They seem to take pride in possessing this "exclusive secret." And everyone is especially interested in things that are more private, so they keep asking. Then, that person says triumphantly, "Ah, he was originally a small carpenter!"</p>
<p>At this point, everyone feels deeply satisfied. Not only because they have uncovered another person's private matter, but also because they feel a sense of superiority - "Ah, my position now may not be as high as yours, my fame may not be as great, my wealth may not be as much, but my background is much better than yours." Ha, a person from a small carpenter background actually made such a fortune and had such good luck! Isn't this just a nouveau riche? What's so special about it!</p>
<p>And many celebrities are afraid that people will bring up their old stories. For example, in my hometown, there is an old painter who used to work as a clerk in a pawnshop when he was young. Because he had a lot of free time, he casually started to paint. Later, he actually became famous, but the first thing he did was to change his name and claim that he came from a family of scholars, never mentioning the word "pawnshop," as if it was a stain on his life. Once, a young student impudently asked him if he had any connection with a certain pawnshop, which was exactly where the old painter used to work. The old painter thought that the student was deliberately making trouble for him, and he got so angry that his beard stood on end, smoke came out of his seven orifices, and he slammed the table, knocking all the stationery and antiques on the table to the ground. In the end, he tremblingly kicked the student out, leaving the student completely baffled.</p>
<p>In fact, what's wrong with being a carpenter? What's so inferior about being a pawnshop clerk? Carpenters earn legitimate rewards with their own labor, and they are good men who are not ashamed before Heaven or man. And pawnshop clerks are also legitimate professions, and there is nothing shameful about them. Compared to the kind of freeloaders and secretaries who serve their masters' every whim all day long, workers and businessmen are far superior. Going from pawnshop clerk to painter is like a person who sells roasted chestnuts changing to sell roasted ginkgo nuts. They are both exchanging their services for money. What difference is there in status?</p>
<p>Among foreigners, the situation is exactly the opposite. We often hear that Edison came from a newspaper boy, Franklin was a poor apprentice with no place to stand when he first arrived in Philadelphia, and Lincoln's childhood poverty and diligent study are even more well-known. Those people chose a path that best suited their interests and ambitions, and they persisted through setbacks and achieved brilliant success. They never shy away from their past, and Lincoln's hard work and honesty became a major asset in his presidential campaign.</p>
<p>Other people's eyes look forward, and they value the "present." But we still have some people who are obsessed with the past, using every means to find an official among their ancestors as a joy. Even now, there are still people who are particularly concerned about other people's "backgrounds," and even now, there are still people who readily bring out "first ×× ancestral ×× (posthumous title) Lord," which is really sad.</p>
<h3>Returning Home</h3>
<p>— Ding Daoheng</p>
<p>I idly calculate as I reach the autumn border, my feelings wane, disliking the peaks that are even more prominent than before. A task is still undone as I travel anxiously, several sounds call for the ferry boat at the crossing. The sorrowful weeping willows always accompany the traveler, the small birds struggle towards the sky. From here, the fishing village has pleasant breezes and sunshine, where the shade of mulberry trees provide a peaceful dwelling.</p>
<h3>Written Upon Arriving in Yangzhou</h3>
<p>The wind... recognizing Yangzhou, ...car crossing Han... Han..., the people seem to have too much makeup, the mountains and rivers are worthy of imperial tours? Thousands of families blow pipes, the youth is boiling, ten miles of tea smoke at the early market. Only the remaining temple of the Southern Tang Dynasty Buddha, has seen the rise and fall, only lowering its head.</p>
<h3>"Undeliverable"</h3>
<p>— Fang Bai</p>
<p>Persian postal regulations prohibit the mailing of razor blades to foreign countries. The British Post Office does not allow people to mail perfume to Basutoland (a British colony) in South Africa.</p>
<p>Lebanon refuses to mail fermented cheese or jam to foreign countries. Turkey does not allow the mailing of syrup and chalk-mixed flour. If you want to mail chalk for children to play with to Egypt, you must write the word "poisonous" on the box in Arabic or some other language.</p>
<p>Mexican beans cannot be mailed to India. Burma prohibits the mailing of bird skins to foreign countries, but ostrich skins for specimen making are not prohibited. Canada prohibits the mailing of live bees, and so does Bulgaria. And every year, except for the two periods from August 1 to September 1 and February 1 to March 15, mailing silkworm eggs in Bulgaria is strictly prohibited.</p>
<p>Guatemala in Central America refuses to mail fighting cock spurs to foreign countries. Colombia prohibits the mailing of tear gas spraying devices to foreign countries. The Dominican Republic on the island of Haiti absolutely prohibits the mailing of small daggers.</p>
<h3>Random Memories of the Book World</h3>
<p>— Qian Dacheng</p>
<p>For the past ten years, I have visited and sought books wherever I have gone, and I have seen many fine editions. I have also paid some attention to the stories of the book world. This year, after lecturing, I have a lot of free time. Therefore, I will describe a few things to fill the "Free Talk" section. I will continue to describe them later.</p>
<p>I once saw two thick volumes of Qian Zunwang's handwritten and collated version of "Biography of Emperor Lie" in the home of my friend Pang Yunqi (Shilong). They were copied on ink-grid manuscript paper of "Preliminary Collection of Learning Assembled Annotations." The words "Learning Assembled" were left blank by one character. There were many corrections throughout the book, which was completely different from the current published version. I was ashamed that I could not borrow it from Yunqi to collate it. Yunqi exchanged this book with others for Bao Shenbo's couplets and other items. Zunwang's handwritten version is extremely rare. His manuscript of "Preliminary Collection of Learning Assembled Annotations" was formerly collected by Mr. Zeng Mengpu, but I heard that it has changed hands now.</p>
<p>My fellow townsman Yan Ruifeng, a book dealer, was a giant in the old book business. Ruifeng once purchased Zeng Wenzheng's annotated "Dan Kui Tang Poetry Collection" of Ji Xianjiu's descendants in the town. Wenzheng's handwritten notes were on the margins of the printed edition, with dense and fine characters, annotating almost everywhere. Xianjiu was Wenzheng's teacher. There was a "Preface to Master Ji Xianjiu's Fiftieth Birthday" and "Inscription on Master Ji Xianjiu's Gathering Orchids and Chrysanthemums Garden" in "Seeking Deficiency Studio Collection," one poem and one essay, showing their teacher-student relationship. However, the world did not know that Wenzheng annotated poems for Xianjiu. Even Xianjiu's descendants sold it among the chaotic books. Zhu Biezhi knew about this book. Ruifeng has been dead for several years now, and this book is very difficult to trace.</p>
<p>In the early years of the Republic of China, Zhao's "Old Mountain Villa" collection of books was intended to change hands. Ding Chuwo, Zhang Shuangnan, and Wang Jiyu planned to work together to negotiate and depreciate its value, but Zhao refused to sell. Mr. Jiyu and Shuangnan said that they would increase the price slightly, but Mr. Chuwo was reluctant, so they gave up. Later, it was finally purchased by Mr. Chuwo alone with his own funds. There were quite a few fine Song and Yuan editions, and the Yuan Dynasty Miscellaneous Dramas of the Yeyuan Old Profession were also among them. After Mr. Chuwo passed away, there was the Ding War of Resistance, and his collection of books was scattered. This matter was revealed to the world. Mr. Chuwo was a famous expert in the study of editions. I should write another article to praise him. (Editor's note: I once obtained Mr. Chuwo's collection of books from Suzhou Lengji, which was also an unexpected good fortune.)</p>
<h3>Salt Administration Expert Zhang Daishan</h3>
<p>— Chen Zuogao</p>
<p>Most of the officials and celebrities of the early Republic of China have disappeared. One of them was Zhang Zhang Daishan, who was proficient in salt affairs and presided over finance twice. During the days when Xiangcheng (Yuan Shikai) seized power and the Feng Faction (Zhang Zuolin) rampaged, he once had a moment of prominence. There are some trivial things that are worth mentioning.</p>
<p>Zhang's original name was Mengao, his courtesy name was Daisu, and his other name was Master of Chaoguan Pavilion. He was a successful candidate in the late Qing Dynasty Renyin Imperial Examination. When taking the exam, he changed his name in his poem to Rihao, his courtesy name Daishan. When the list of successful candidates was announced, the news of his success reached his residence, but his family did not know that Mengao had changed his name, so they looked at each other in surprise. Zhang was originally from Shanyin, Zhejiang. His father, Du..., died in the official residence. When Zhang grew up, he stayed in Fujian to earn a living. His movements, habits, and language were all like those of a Fujianese. Those who met him always said, "I suspect that Zhang is not from Zhejiang." During the Xinchou year of Guangxu, my late paternal uncle Zu Xinquan served as the chief of the Nantai Copper Coin Bureau. Zhang and my father were colleagues, and they shared desks and meals. Soon, they were both transferred to the School Affairs Office. At that time, Rao Hanxiang was just a staff member of the Industrial Affairs Section. He looked at Zhang's face, and they spoke shallowly to each other and looked down on each other.</p>
<p>His family was always poor, and they lacked servants at home. Every morning, before going to the official residence, his wife, Madam Liang, would look in the mirror and comb her hair, while Zhang would tease his children and make them laugh, working hard like a virtuous wife. He once suffered from his wife's illness and delayed his exam for three years. Their affection was well-known in the neighborhood. After he passed the exam, he handled the documents in the Zhejiang Governor's office. He was impeached by General Chong (a Manchu), and eventually lost his official position. Through the introduction of Lv Chengting (a Fujian official), he entered the Jilin Official Transport Bureau, which was the beginning of his salt administration career. Not long after, Xiong Xiling was appointed as the commissioner of Salt Transportation for the three northeastern provinces. Hearing of his ability, he appointed him as a section chief. After the Restoration, Xiong was appointed as the Minister of Finance and Acting Premier. Recognizing Zhang's contribution to preserving the huge amount of money and seals in the Jilin treasury, he appointed him as the Salt Transport Commissioner of Changlu, and then promoted him to the Salt Transport Commissioner of Lianghuai. During this period, he planned the salt administration regulations, stipulated the detailed rules for increasing production, and adjusted the audit offices. His reputation was well-known. When the Xu Baoshan case arose, Zhang mediated and resolved it, and the matter was settled peacefully. He accumulated merit and was promoted to Vice Minister of Finance and concurrently served as the Director of the Salt Administration. At that time, Xiangcheng (Yuan Shikai) ruled autocratically. Those who were called talented among the vice ministers of the Beijing ministries were always Zi Hutong (Gong Chuo, Vice Minister of Transportation), Xu Youzheng (Xu Shuzheng, Vice Minister of the Army), and Zhang Daishan. They were called the three famous vice ministers. Xiangcheng consulted Zhang every day, and his courtesy almost exceeded that of the ministers. Later, after Xiangcheng died, Zhang Zuolin specially added Luo Zheng (a high-ranking official title) and began to belong to the Feng Faction, serving as the president of the Currency Bureau and twice as the Minister of Finance.</p>
<p>After becoming well-known and holding high positions, he frequently changed wives. First, he took a certain woman, who was Madam Liang's hairdressing woman. He was charmed by her, and she was favored and always accompanied him. More than two years later, he divorced the woman because she was crazy, and then married the hairdressing girl, who was very virtuous and lived with him until old age.</p>
<p>Some say that Zhang hid paintings, calligraphy, and editions, traveling north and south. He was usually humble and elegant, and he respected scholars very much. He admired Fang Dishan (Erqian), who was proficient in inspecting posts, and could pick up anything easily, so he appointed him as the manager of the Twelve Weir Warehouse in Yangzhou. Unfortunately, he loved gambling in his later years and eventually lost his family wealth, living in seclusion and depression. Before the Lugouqiao Incident, a certain official of the National Government's Finance Bureau wanted to promote the reorganization of the salt administration, hoping to achieve quick results. At that time, he was already critically ill and dying, and he could not be revived. He died in a narrow room in the Hutong of Suzhou, the old capital. Looking back at the past, it was like a dream. When Zhang lived in Jianyuan, he was superstitious about house physiognomy and often said to people, "A fortune teller said that my character, which is Yi Hai, Yi You, Yi Hai, Yi You, contains hidden titles. Those who are good at ending their lives are also in this character." In conclusion, he was still a salt administration expert.</p>
