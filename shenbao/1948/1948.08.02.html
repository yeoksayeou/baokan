<h3>預算案政院不提複議　普通部門即公布　特別預算仍將保守秘密</h3>
<p>〔本報南京一日電〕卅七年下半年度國家歲入·歲出總預算案，經立院審查完畢送政院後，政院已於卅一日臨時會中討論，一致認爲大體良好，即咨覆立院，不擬提請複議。茲悉：立院於收到該覆文後，即於短期內公布其普通部份之全部，特別預算則仍保守秘密</p>
<p>〔本報南京一日電〕卅七年下半年度總預算內曾列有關房屋建築費三萬億元，該款之分配辦法，經政院擬定，並經其他四院秘書長之同意，業已確定，即將由政務會議討論，茲探誌其要點如次：（一）建築費之分配，以五院及其直屬各部會職員宿舍爲限，其他機關所需宿舍之建築，將來另案籌劃辦理。（二）分配數額，以各機關查報尚無宿舍之職員人數爲標準比例計算。（三）依照上列範圍，五院及各部會尚無宿舍人數共八千餘人，每人平均分配數爲三億七千餘萬元。（四）建築方式及標準力求一致。按該項辦法尚未經政院通過，故各機關職員宿舍之建築顯尚有待，惟立委宿舍之建築費計一萬八千億元，早經政院通過，其數額幾相近於五院職員宿舍建築費總額三分之二，而立院職員之宿舍建築費，則仍在三萬億元內開支。</p>

<h3>社論　如何招徠外匯資金</h3>
<p>『僑資及國人在外資金投資國內生產事業申請輸入辦法』，雖業經行政院公佈，但實施細則尚在當局審核之中，故在事實上，這個招徠外匯資金的新措施，至今尚未實施。本報對於改善僑滙，早已有所建議，故對於這個新措施，如何招徠外匯資金，願再進一步提出幾點意見，以供主管當局的參玫。</p>
<p>第一，我們不能不指出，擁有外匯的是一批人，而志願興辦事業的又是一批人，資本家與企業家，在事實上，往往不能混爲一談，只消看看交易所裏那些主顧，翻多翻空，瞬息萬變，就可知有錢人心理之一斑。何况僑資裏頭，多半是胼手胝足所得，零星匯到本國來贍家的，他們何嘗都有回國興辦事業的志願及能力？今辦法第八·九·十等條，規定僑資　回，旣須以創辦或擴充事業爲前提，而其辦貨回國，除一部份得轉售外，其售得款項，並須存入指定銀行按照核定之生產計劃支用，那麼，是項僑資，又何從順利地誘導回國？最難索解的是，僑資所有人的身份，必須由當地使領館書面證明，並須經僑務委員會覆核認可，方許照上開各條辦理，難道政府還怕有人冒充僑民匯款回國嗎？</p>
<p>第二，我們認爲新措施對於國人在外資金，申請輸入的限制太嚴，恐不足以招徠外匯資金·例如：</p>
<p>（一）須經所在地存款銀行證明，確在三十七年六月卅日以前存入者。　所在地存款銀行，如果不予證明，何故不許其回國投資？是不是怕另有糾葛，要連累到政府身上去？現在舉國上下，不是高喊着，要借用或徵用這些資金嗎？這些資金，現還沒有流回，而政府巳先附以條件，明示限制，未審究竟具何用意？還是怕它們多多流回嗎？又卅七年六月卅日以後的存款，又何以定要禁止其回國？是否怕有人套匯，或把資金先私自逃避出去，而再循這個途徑投資回來？我們以爲資金逃避，自應設法禁止，若事前禁止不成，而事後能自動地依法流回本國，似乎應當歡迎，何以有再加禁止之必要？</p>
<p>（二）必須進口之生產器材，確爲申請人自用者，又所辦事業必需進口之原料，確爲申請人自用，不超過生產所需六個月之用量者。這類規定，意在嚴格限制國人的在外資金，在申請辦貨回國時，只准自己應用，不許轉讓他人，而且限定數量，不許任意多辦。後一段的限制，其意當在取締囤積，是否有此必要，茲姑不論。所要討論的是上文說過，有錢的人，不一定會辦生產，尤其是辦工廠，而會辦生產與會辦工廠的，又不一定在外國存有資金，何以限定必須自有自用，而不許他們自行劃借？假如准其自行劃借，於國家究有何害？於雙方當事人又有何害？現在國內辦廠，除絕少數屬獨資性質者外，大多數是合股開辦，或另行隨時融通的，此項普通的慣習，不知以何理由竟不能適用於這一類資金及其所辦的工廠？現在不是標榜着歡迎外資來華興辦實業嗎？對於這一類外資究竟是獨資，是合資，是自有，是他有，好像還沒有嚴格的限制，輸管會已明白表示，將另行考慮，何以對於國人在外的資金，反必須規定自己運用，絕對不許轉讓？</p>
<p>（三）創辦或擴充事業其工程進度；及輸入器材物料與原料之使用儲存，應由申請人按月以書面報吿，必要時得派員考核之。這一條是鄭重考核，防止其私自轉售的意思，似乎無可厚非。不過其他甩外滙辦進來的器材，物料，與原料，似乎並沒有這一類條件，何以對於國人在外資金所辦進來的，偏要特別加以嚴防？是否這批進口貨含有意外的危險？還是名爲歡迎招徠而實則仍忌其多多輸入呢？</p>
<p>（四）如有轉售圖利情事，其申請人及代辦之進口商，受永久停配原料限額，與永久不得申請輸入任何物品之處分。　這也是管制貿易中應有的文章。不過這項罰則，應同樣適用於其他一切外洋定貨，方謂公允。若其他外滙所定的進口貨，乃至從限額分配得來的進口貨，可以公然轉售圖利，其申請人與進口商一無責任，而對於自有的在外資金所辦進來的物品獨如此嚴格，這也未免顯分厚薄，於義殊無可取。</p>
<p>總之，在這外滙基金十分竭蹶之秋，對於一切僑資與國人在外資金，原則上似歡迎其來，不當絕之使去·辦貨回國也好，自行設廠也好，自用也好，轉讓也好，只須依法申請，獲得許可，似可一律容納，不須多設禁例。現行辦法，就因爲障礙太多，等同深閉固拒，使其無法流入，以致是項資金，紛紛流入黑市，或逃向香港。此次窮極思變，另訂新章，原是要吸引自備外滙資金，又何必膠柱鼓瑟，過分拘泥在投資設廠這一點上，仍把它檔在門外，成爲可望而不可卽的現象？有人以爲：中國的法令不必看得通於呆板，只須有一綫之路可通，商人們自不患無移花接木之術，可資配合。我們看到年來走私的旺盛，與外滙黑市的猖獗，這種揣測，或許確是將來自然調整的一途。然而誰爲爲之，孰令至此？明知執法難行，而立法力求其嚴，又不得不令人扼腕嘆惜了。</p>

<p>〔中央社南京一日電〕共匪董必武近以其所謂一中國解放區救濟總會主委」之名義，對世界公誼會中國服務會會長郝思金斯及美國紅會駐華代表李諾德，以荒謬之言詞發出廣播，誣指中央政府阻撓黃河搶險工程，致黃河南岸大堤已臨決口危險，揑造事實，顚倒是非，淆亂聽聞，水利部發言人特為駁斥如下：查黃河下游堤防，關係豫·冀·魯·蘇·皖諸省安危，中央向極重視，抗戰勝利之初，即列黃河堵口復堤工程，爲戰後復員首要工作，積極推進，雖在共匪多方阻撓破壞之下，堵口工程終於卅六年三月間完成，復堤部份，則因共匪之阻撓，未能與堵口工程配合進行，當時河歸故道，大汛瞬臨，時迫工艱，危機隱伏，中央當就國軍控制之堤段，計豫冀兩省及魯西南岸及魯中濟南附近，齊河濟陽間兩岸堤段加緊施工，幷於上年六月間，經聯絡居間由中央及中共聯總三方面派員組織混合委員會，商討如何使復堤修防工程不受軍事影響，會議正在進行之際，劉匪伯承所部，突於六月卅日由董口大批渡河，到處竄擾，捕殺我修防員工，迫使冀南魯西修防工作陷於停頓，混合委員會亦因共匪無誠意商談，而吿結束。其後劉匪主力南竄大別山區，沿河秩序粗吿恢復，我員工始得返工，繼續從事修守，大汎期間幸獲安瀾，十二月共匪侵佔東明，蘭封，至魯西南岸間堤段悉吿撤守，共匪自盤踞該段河堤後，對於堤防，非特不加修護，復從事有計劃之破壞，自銅瓦廂至臨濮集　之堤頂，均被普遍挖掘闊數丈，深數尺之南溝壕，沿堤　壩護岸存料糧物及段汎房屋，亦多被燬，本年五月間，冀南魯西國軍前進，我修防員工甫經隨軍返防，展開工作，乃共匪陳毅所部，又於六月二日由董口南渡，我工段人員迫不得已，除留一部份汎隊技工，化裝看守外，其餘又均隨軍撤退。六月下旬開封復一度被陷共匪竟將我黃河水利工程總局付之一炬，各種儀器材料，傢俱汽車，被焚燬或被搶刧，無一倖存。河南河北兩修防處，亦損失甚重，豫境開封以下各工段及磚料廠之器材，均被燬掠一空，今春所作未完新工，亦被破壞，其仇視堤防，仇視沿河民衆，並爲顯而易見之事實。最近，冀境東明之高村出險，情勢危急，該處爲匪佔領以來，僅有少數員工化裝看守，經利用存磚搶修，惟大溜頂衝甚烈，勢仍極危，已由黃河水利工程總局督飭河北修防處派員隨軍前往搶修，此事爲政府職責所在，且爲地方人民安危所關，始終極力以赴，雖迭受匪擾，我員工仍出生入死，不避艱險，拼命工作，計卅　　五年間被共匪俘去者卅三人，被殺害者五人，失踪者廿三人，卅六年間被共匪俘去者十三人，被殺害者四十一人，失踪者四十四人，受傷者四人，本年內被俘者一人，被害者六人，失踪者一百六十三人，受傷者二人。乃董匪反誣指黃河南岸冀魯兩省交界處之東明至鄄城段及濟南附近一段搶修工程，逍中央阻擾，瀕臨決口危險，顚倒黑白，不値一辯，但於此應請中外人士注意者，共匪初則多方阻擾堵口，今復蓄意破壞復堤，上年六月卅日劉匪之渡河，與今年六月二日陳匪之渡河，受擾害者，首即河工，誰爲禍首，人所共見，今乃乘大汎來臨之際，忽又無的放矢，反噬中央，窺其用意，顯有造成人爲決堤之陰謀，預爲嫁禍於中央留地步，其鬼蜮伎倆，欲蓋彌彰，吾人切望中外人士母爲共匪此等亂言所惑，並盼共匪激發天良，以人民生命財產爲重，放棄此項毒計，退出盤踞黃河南岸區域，俾我地方政府及水利機關對於修防工作得以放手進行，自信必能防護水患，否則大水一至，不幸發生決口慘劇，其一切責任，應完全由共匪負之。</p>

<h3>莫洛托夫縮短假期　分別接見三特使　解決東西爭執開始接觸</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕倫敦一日廣播：美英法三國使節於三十一日晚，意外晤見蘇外長莫洛托夫後，今在史密斯寓邸聚晤，精神煥發，對各人會見莫洛托夫之印象，互相交換意見。三使簡業將美英法三國解決東西爭執之建議向莫氏提出，預料在下週初以前，西方國家與蘇聯間有關德國及柏林問題之折衝不致于有新的發展。蓋蘇聯對於美英法三國使簡之答覆，必將愼重考慮也。</p>
<p>〔中央社莫斯科三十一日合衆電〕莫洛托夫今日縮短休假期間，自莫斯科郊外避暑別墅返外部，與美英法三國代表舉行德境東西雙方危機之會商。莫氏先後接見美大使史密斯·英外相貝文之私人秘書羅伯茲，及法大使夏台諾，與每人會談約三十分鐘。各人將其政府對蘇聯封鎖柏林之態度，面吿蘇外長，並就整個德國情勢，有所檢討。先是三國代表，昨晚與代表莫洛托夫之外次佐林晤談時，表示欲與蘇方最高官員充分討論柏林問題，佐氏遂將此意轉達莫洛托夫，後者乃決定親自接見三國代表。</p>
<p>〔合衆社倫敦一日電〕消息靈通之政界人士一日稱，東西兩集團爲柏林封鎖而攤牌，並不一定促成新的世界大戰，然盟國必須準備戰爭，以爲對蘇外交攻勢之後盾，而阻止蘇聯獨覇德國。傳美國有勢力之官員多人絕對悲觀，認爲與蘇聯商討解決德國問題，無異與虎謀皮，彼等認爲西方國家如不攤牌，則無法打開德國僵局。又傳專家多人稱，攤牌事雖不致立即發生，然最後必有實現之一日。彼等對整個德局悲觀，特別是與克林姆宮交涉之「新策略」。彼等認爲蘇聯條件太苛，與蘇談話決無獲致「協議」之可能。</p>
<p>同時莫斯科來訊，美法兩大使·英國特使及三國外交幹部，正討論柏林問題之次一步驟。官員稱，凡有關談判進展之消息，應自三國京城發出。在倫敦之美人相信，東西對德協議已屬無望，並指出德國之管制已有孤注一擲之勢。歐洲其他各國均已擇善而從。蘇聯完全控制東德，如蘇聯與西方協議，即應稍弛其在本國佔領區內之獨覇。西方盟國則完全控制西德，現正計劃在佛蘭克福成立西德政府，使之與馬歇爾計劃及西歐聯盟發生聯繫。與蘇協議無異放棄西德使之受蘇聯覇佔之威脅。</p>

<h3>前白宮顧問與前財次　牽涉美國間諜綱　間諜小姐指二人供給蘇聯情報</h3>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓卅一日電〕供稱曾爲共黨間諜之班特萊小姐，卅一日證明前白宮顧問及前財次爲洩露秘密情報至蘇聯之許多政府官員中之二人。班氏於一九四五年自動放棄間諜工作，並向聯邦調查局自首，且於卅一日向衆院非美人活動委員會作公開陳述。</p>
<p>班氏供認故總統羅斯福及本屆總統杜魯門之前顧問柯利，經中間人之轉手，曾向班氏洩露美國已「將譯出」一九四四年之蘇聯密電碼。此事使蘇聯「十分興奮」。柯氏並曾一度爲羅斯福訪問中國之私人代表，班小姐並供認前財次惠德，爲供給情報之另一官員，此等情報經由班氏之手而遞交蘇聯。班特萊小姐並不立即說明惠氏供給何項情報。惠德於一九三四年九月任職於財政部，於一九四五年陞任財次，渠曾任國際貨幣基金組織之官員班小姐除供認柯氏洩露將譯出蘇聯密碼外，柯氏並曾報吿當時中國局勢之「內部糾紛」。班氏强調柯利並非共黨，但曾供給情報。柯利之情報通常交給鐵路局雇員薛佛曼，薛氏轉交經濟戰爭局官員薛佛馬斯德，薛氏再轉交班小姐。關於惠德方面，班氏供認不知渠是否亦係共黨。班氏並供認政府內供給情報之大小官員之姓名。聞以此等官員是否知悉供給情報之意義，班小姐答稱，渠可確保「柯利必知情報之遞往何方」。</p>
<p>柯利否認　供給密碼</p>
<p>〔合衆社紐約三十一日電〕故總統羅斯福及本屆總統杜魯門之前行政顧問柯利三十一日稱：渠從未知道班特萊小姐之名，柯利發表文吿稱：「盡余所知，余絕未與共黨員或共黨之代理人有過任何直接或間接之交往，余從未晤及班特萊小姐，亦不知其名，余個人之工作從未涉及軍事密碼，故余決不可能供給任何有關密碼之情報給任何人。」</p>
<p>〔合衆社紐約卅一日電〕曾任故總統羅斯福及本屆總統杜魯門之行政顧問之柯利，曾以羅斯福總統私人代表資格訪問中國，並於一九四五年正月重返白宮出任總統之行政顧問。柯氏並曾率領經濟代表團赴瑞士，旨在勸諫瑞士停止與德進行大部份戰時貿易</p>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓三十一日電〕非美人活動委員會委員拉斯金衆議員三十一日稱：渠對該會化費許多時間討論「汚辱柯利」之事，表示不滿，拉斯金稱：渠不知該會何以能相信如班特萊之前共產黨員之第三流情報。渠認班特萊所稱者可能係撒謊，但班特箂則稱：渠所稱各節之是否眞實，可由委員會決定。</p>
<p>惠特不識　間諜小姐</p>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓三十一日電〕前財政部次長惠特三十一日否認渠曾以機密之政府情報，供給任何可能供給莫斯科之人。惠特自紐約來電話稱：渠從未聽到班特萊小姐之名，渠要求衆院非美人活動委員會允許其作證，以「反駁此種漲衊。」</p>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓三十一日電〕衆院非美人活動委員會主席弗哥遜三十一日稱：該會將允許商務部經濟專家雷明頓之要求，親自與班時莢小姐對質，雷明頓亦爲班小姐所控供給渠情報之官員之一。雷明頓則稱：渠供給班特萊消息，係認渠爲新聞記者，該項消息「對於知道善用報紙之研究工作者，均可供給。」</p>

<h3>多瑙河公約準備工作　奧被擯不得參加　法要求保持航行自由權　與蘇代表展開激烈爭辯</h3>
<p>〔中央社貝爾格勒德卅一日合衆電〕蘇聯集團國家今一致拒絕奧國參加多瑙河新公約準備工作。多瑙河會議今以七票通過（英美法三國　權）維辛斯基之動議，即奧國於會議中，僅有供請詢權力。按事先美大使凱戲建議總國可充分參與會議工作，並有表決權，此建議經七票對三票（法國棄權）否決。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社貝爾格勒三十一電〕今日多瑙河會議之特點，爲法代表要求維持法國於前多瑙河公約中所獲享之權利。法蘇代表因以曾作激烈之爭論。今晨據法代表團主席法大使蒂文利在會中聲稱，不顧以前各項權利之任何新公約，法國不能受其拘束，非預先商得有關各方之同意，無多數能取銷現有之條例。繼奧代表羅森堡起立聲明奧國有參加會議之充分權利，不得僅以備諮詢之資格列席。法奧代表之要求，均由英美代表團予以贊助，但其餘諸國均表示反對。捷克之克萊門蒂斯·羅馬尼亞之鮑克·匈牙利之摩爾納·保加利亞之卡門諾夫均稱法國之要求，等於藉口己獲之權利，僭欲予以保持，此項特殊權益均爲帝國主義之强國犧牲多瑙河濱諸小國合法之利益與天然之權利及主權而攫得者。惟羅馬尼亞外長承認法國人民在多瑙河上有特別利益，希望對此能獲得諒解。蘇聯外次維辛斯基以嚴厲之措詞，與法代表爭辯歷一小時之久，維氏會曰，一吾人永不接受哀的美敦，門戶今仍開啓，供爾走入，且仍開啓供爾走出。此地無荷比盧國，唯有主權與平等國」。維氏繼又滔滔發言，表示一九二一年之多瑙河條例今已不復存在，因已由簽字國屢加更改並破壤之故。末謂新多瑙河公約必須由多數國通過，依多數國之意志而實行之，估少數之各國祗能遵守多數國之決議。</p>

<p>〔合衆社布達佩斯一日電〕匃牙利各黨領袖一日集會，並一致擁護聯合工黨主席薩卡西資繼蒂爾才爲總統。公報稱，蒂氏子婿索諾基之逮捕令尚未發出，政府官員對此仍嚴守秘密。按薩氏之能被推爲總統，係共黨酬謝其在社會民主黨併入共黨或爲聯合工黨之功。</p>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓一日電〕前匃牙利總理那基自去年五月政變後，即流亡出國，一日宣稱，東歐共黨之肅淸非共產領袖，表示蘇聯正令其衛星國準備對西方作戰。又稱，蒂爾才總統「無疑」係被共黨所逐出，與捷克之貝奈斯如同一轍。「顯然蘇聯正擬推行新外交政策，依此則東歐政治之重要職位，均應由忠實之共產黨徒棠管。此新外交政策即係準備對民主國家及美國作戰。」</p>
<h3>紐約國際新機塲落成　美空軍盛大表演　參加各式飛機八百五十架　杜魯門杜威親臨檢閱</h3>

<h3>暹衆議院定期討論　排除華僑入境案　全案如通過等於禁絕外人入境</h3>
<p>〔中央社曼谷一日電〕暹羅鑾角頌報中將頃採納一現在美國之暹羅下級軍官之見解，分函全體議員，主張入境華僑人數每年應减至廿人。鑾氏函稱：日前外國人民大量移入暹羅，不久之後，暹羅人民將喪失謀生之一切機會，僅餘皮骨。</p>
<p>鑾氏並舉美國爲例稱：「余考慮此一問題之際，接駐美下級軍官函稱，美國面積爲暹羅之十二倍，然規定每年華僑入境數目則僅一百零五人，同時美國亦尚希望中國支持其民主思想，按照此一比例，暹羅之應將限額定爲廿人，西方人民限額亦應如是」。暹羅前任總理民主黨領袖乃白亞拜橫稱：鑾氏以暹羅與美國相比，不知是何用意。按乃索里衆議員曾於衆院建議，將外人入境額限爲每年二千名，衆院可能於五日討論此案，故鑾氏乃乘機提出此項主張。乃索里提出修正案之理由，爲暹羅人民不及外人勤勞，故以此爲示範作用，然鑾氏所主張者，則幾爲禁絕外人入境。</p>
<h3>看英國政治</h3>
<p>— 本報倫敦特約通訊　薩本耿</p>
<p>（一）</p>
<p>英國現在是工黨執政，工黨的主要政策，在政治方面，承認英國式的民主政治，認爲現行的國會制度，可以導英國入於社會主義國家的途徑。在經濟方面，它主張在「有償」的原則之下，由國家經營各種大企業。由於前一點，使它和蘇聯共產黨有極大的出入，因爲蘇聯的共產黨或蘇聯式的共產主義，在理論上是崇奉馬克斯列寗的階級鬥爭說，雖則有人認爲依據馬克斯主義，社會主義社會的實現，未必非採暴力革命不可（例如考茨基就是這樣的說法），但是這並不爲今日之共產黨所承認</p>
<p>在實際上，近若干年來，各國共產主義者，雖然也標榜民主，或者說也以民主政治者自居，但是這裏發生一個名詞的解釋問題，看過列寗所著的「國家與革命」，蘇聯新舊憲法的內容及其修改的經過，注意近年各國共產黨的實際行動，可以知道共產黨的民主政治，並不同於英國式的民主政治。由於經濟方面的政策，使它也與美國不同。資本主義的經濟制度，首先是跟着工業革命而發源於英國，但是今天，代表資本主義的經濟制度者，應該是美國而不復是英國。不論今天的資本主義已經發展到了怎樣的階段，它仍然是無條件的崇奉「私有財產制度」與「企業自由」。凡是無條件的崇奉「私有財產制度」者，則不論「有償」「無償」，都不可能由國家接收私人企業，凡是無條件的祟奉「企業自由」者，它就不能談政府對於企業的管制。這些，使英國與美國不同，雖則英國的工黨，仍然是承認私有財產制度的存在。自然的，在經濟方面，工黨的政策雖與美國不同，但它也與共產黨有別。共產主義者對於社會經濟的改造，是採着遠較工黨爲激烈的辦法。共產主義者決無此心情坐在國會裏面，慢慢的討論那種企業應該國有，那種企業不必國有，如果國有，其接收的辦法又若何。這樣，我們可以說工黨是一種「中間性」很濃厚的政黨，它主張改造社會而又無取於暴力。</p>
<p>（二）</p>
<p>英國工黨成立以來，已經有五十年左右的歷史，現在的工黨政府，是基於一九四五年的大選勝利，在表面上，這是英國第三次工黨政府，第一次是一九二三至一九二四年，第二次是一九二九至一九三一年，但是這兩次的工黨政府，都沒有能够在國會中佔有過半數的議席，而是以自由然的協助而成立。因此，它不但「短命」，幷且在事實上幷不能完全採用自己的政策。自一九三一年以後，工黨雖則也參加過政府，但談不上執政。一九四五年的選舉，工黨取得國會半數以上的議席，它執政了，淸一色的工黨政府擁有國會的多數議席，它是英國有史以來的第一次。根據一九一一年的國會法，英國的國會任期五年，因此，除非有特殊的情形，使工黨政府覺得有解散國會訴之選民的必要，或者工黨內部發生嚴重的分化，則工黨將有五年施政的機會。由現在算起，也還有一年多。</p>
<p>工黨執政以來，幹了什麼事呢？也許是工黨的不幸，也許是工黨的大幸，使它有表演一下的機會。工黨政府雖則成立於對德戰爭勝利之後，但是它却是遭遇到英國嚴重的經濟恐慌。這個恐慌的原因，早己潛伏。戰爭消耗了英國的國富特別是海外財產，使它無法彌補，因食糧原料進口而形成之入超。英國是工業革命的發源地，這使英國在若干方面比別的國家先走了一步，而使它在近代史上佔有若干便宜。也是爲了它是工業革命發源地，工業化太早，而又使它今天在某些方面吃了許多虧。人民生活的永準提得太高，到今天國家雖窮而不易收縮。若干交通工具以及生產機械，時代太久，失之陳舊，加以戰時消耗較大。現在要想「改」需有大資本，不改則又影響效率，直接間接影響生產。工黨政府在這兩年來，除了國際問題不算，簡直是在與經濟恐慌作生死存亡的鬥爭。去年夏間以後，英鎊的停兌，衣食配給的减少，實在表示問題到了最高峯。</p>
<p>但是工黨還是有作爲的。除了號召上下節衣縮食努力生產以外，工黨不斷的進行國有政策。英格蘭銀行，煤礦，電業，重要交通工具，煤氣業等項，都已歸國營。在政治方面，上議院改造的進行，取消下議院複數選權制的提出，都在着手進行中。但是老百姓是最現實的，也許是由於去年地方選舉的失敗，使工黨有所戒備，而使它必須做一些現實的奪取下屆選舉票的事情。也許是工黨本身的政策使然，今年四月財政大臣在國會中提出的本年度預算案，實是工黨政策的精彩表演。它修改了所得稅制度，使中等階級沾光不少，它實行「特別捐」，以减少財富之集中。工黨是溫和的社會主義者，任何一個溫和的社會主義政黨，它必須維持中產階級的存在，而不能把社會弄成「不歸楊則歸墨」的極端狀態。「極端」是與「溫和」相矛盾的，工黨大約看淸了這一點，是以工黨的政治，固然尊重「工會」的利益與意見，它也維護着中產者，我想這不該只解釋爲爭取下次選票，而應該視爲一個基本的態度。目前的形勢，在經濟方面也開始好轉，馬歇爾計劃固然使工黨可以喘一口氣，英國的生產也有了進步，去春還鬧煤荒，今春，煤不但不荒，幷且己開始輸出了。</p>
<p>（三）</p>
<p>但是工黨在英國之施政，是否就此一帆風順呢？但亦不然。</p>
<p>第一，如上所述，工黨是中間性很濃厚的政黨，而中間的路綫，是最不易走的。左派可以批評你保守，右派可以駡你過激。幷且，你自己如何的保持着中間的路綫，也沒有「天秤」可以替你衡量。因此，中間性濃厚的政黨，是最容易內鬨或分化的。據我們所知，關於英國的外交政策，究竟是應該與美國合作，抑與蘇聯合作，或者是自立於兩大之間，工黨內部未見有完全統一的見解。又如鋼鐵工業是否應該立即國有問題，也使工黨內部有所爭議。去年十月內閣之局部改組，據說即與黨內問題有關。最近義大利舉行大選，很明白的工黨的基本態度是希望現政府勝利，然而在選舉前夕，有籍隸工黨的國會議員若干人，致電反政府而與共產黨合作之社會黨，祝其最後勝利。這個問題就涉及黨紀問題，而鬧了好幾天。這類事情可能還會有的，這不是工黨本身之是否健全，而是工黨的本質使然。如何來克服這個可能產生的黨內意見紛歧，是一個問題。</p>
<p>第二，工黨爲了實現它的主張，爲了爭取下次選舉的選民，自然要從事若干改革。每一改革都可能遭遇阻力，幷且這些阻力，可能是越來越大。據傳說，鋼鐵工業國有問題，本來就該開始，但因爲它是直接侵及有力者的利益，因此，不能不使工黨有所躊躇。又如擬實行之公醫制度，由我們看來是很好的，但却遇到了　師們的阻力。最近之新預算案，也使保守分子大事非議。無疑義的，工黨政策所可能遇到的阻力還很多。英國的社會機構，雖與美國不同，但是它仍然是老牌的資本主義國家，這些反抗改革的力量，是必須加以老慮的。</p>
<p>第三，如上所述，英國現在正鬧着經濟恐慌，這個恐慌使政府不容易向人民表現成績以爭取選票。並且由於恐慌，不能不借重於美國的經濟援助，這樣，在外交或內政上，可能直接或間接的受到美國的影響，這個影響之可能阻碍或延緩英國的改革，不論英國工黨之是否承認，由局外人看來，是不易避免的。</p>
<p>由於上述，我們不能不認爲工黨的前途，是有着若干困難存在。當然的，在另一方面也有若干可以樂觀的。英國工業革命與民主政治之建立，都是經過逐漸演化的途徑而沒有流血。英國的一切事物，看來都是發展的，生長的，而不是製造的。它旣可和平的完成民主制度之成立，自然也可能和平的建立社會主義社會。這個試驗的成敗，它直接與英國人民之福利有關，間接也影響到全世界。由現在看來，成敗雖不可知，但是即使保守黨再度上台，也未見得能够把英國變成以前的英國。已國營的工業，難道又可能再改爲民營嗎？英國的政治前途，仍然是樂觀的，假定工黨能够堅持執行它的政策。（七月二日）</p>

<h3>八月份上期指數　工商界表示憂慮</h3>
<p>大鈔發行後，由於中央銀行及有關當局配合處置得宜，物價較爲穩定，七月份得以平安渡過，惟一般工商業對於八月份之種種，均認爲未能樂觀，僉以配給米價增加及公用事業交通事業之漲價，頗有促使物價上漲之虞。蓋配米及公用事業均影響本月上半月之生活費指數，此對工廠商店負担將益形加重，屆時發放工資，即成最大問題。加以物價高漲，購買力已普遍减低，而由於各地交通不便，貨品銷路均形呆滯，故當局對物價上漲，應速採取有效方策，予以阻止，否則其後果將不堪設想，而對上海各重要工業亦應速加維護，以免遭遇嚴東危機也。</p>
<h3>提倡國貨演說決賽　兩組兒童六名獲獎</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕中華國產廠商聯合會，上海市市校敎師福利促進會聯合主辦之「提倡國貨兒　演說競賽會」，昨日上午九時，於國貨展覽人會會塲舉行。曹志功主席，致開會詞，略謂，「本會與市敎福利促進會，合辦提倡國貨兒童演說競賽會，旨在宣揚國貨，優勝兒童，由本會會員工廠贈送獎品，以資激勵，俾各小朋友，由認識國貨宣傳國貨，進而愛用國貨」。繼由李玻報吿，參加演說競賽之兒童，計分甫北西郊四區，預賽係田各區舉行，今日係將各區之冠軍亞軍舉行決賽。旋即開始演講，結果計高級組第一名何敏娟，第二名黃志均，第三名馮炳燕。中級組第一名黃乃人，第二名戴瑛，第三名喻咪咪。獎品計有各廠商捐贈之文具，皮球，衣衫及日用品多種。至十二時始賽畢，由主席團分別給獎散會。</p>
<h3>配米價格公布　門市見新高價　決採緊急措施　並謀疏通來源</h3>
<p>本月份配米價格公佈後，昨日之食米市價，竟又突破新高價，門售市價竟有高達五千萬元者，市政當局對此頗爲注意，爲遏止米價漲風，今日南北市塲開市時，決採緊急措施，蓋際此新穀登塲，米源旺暢，及戶口米繼續配售之時，米價之上漲，顯屬人爲，故對一般只顧私利之投機份子及囤積居奇者，決予嚴重打擊。</p>
<p>另一方面，八月份普通配米及平糶配米，均已積極推進，據悉：糧食部對本市食米問題，現已擬定澈底安定米價之有効方案，將會同市府及民調會，決定於短期內，動用大批資金，向國外產米區暹羅·西貢·巴西等地及國內產米區蘇州·無錫·等地於新榖登塲之際，採購大批食米，俾十月·十一月·十二月三個月配售工作，能繼續維持。</p>
<h3>平糶證未接到前　貧民應暫緩購米</h3>
<p>據民調會悉：此次舉辦貧民平糶米，爲避免發生流弊起見，特規定貧民平糶證，應有計口配售證附同使用，始能生效。茲因貧民調查登記尚在審核中，爲免各貧戶先行購買戶口米，致平糶證失却效用，除通知各保田長轉知各戶外，　盼市民注意。凡已列入貧戶名册之各戶，應暫緩購買計口配售米，其計口配售證，須俟貧民平糶證發給後附同使用，俾免平糶證失却效用。</p>
<h3>海寗破獲　偽造關金機關　人犯將解滬</h3>
<p>浙江省保安司令部據報，該省海寗縣馬牧鄕破獲一龐大僞鈔機關，僞造大批五千元關金。一干人犯巳經悉數拘獲。聞該案牽連頗廣，故將於日內解本市有關機關訊辦。該項僞鈔印刷糢糊，尤以總理像爲甚，「關金五千元」字樣，亦較粗劣，「中央印製廠」之「製」字，更爲糊塗。聞該項僞鈔已有若千流用來滬，希各市民密切注意。</p>
<h3>二期房屋義賣劵　一時尚不能發行</h3>
<p>物價穩定後始可實現</p>
<p>第二期義賣房屋券發行事，據記者獲悉，刻仍由上海市救濟委員會房屋義賣部籌備中，其建築房屋之基地問題，前經該部負責勘妥爲南市閘北二處，然因購地組（地政局）至今未將該項地皮之價格洽妥，以致無法建造。同時以近來物價波動過於激烈，地主往往視爲俏貨而不願　易出售。惟吳市長仍在力謀推動此項工作，因非此不足以解決本市房荒。吳氏並盼籌辦義屋各部份，切實從速合作。聞第二期房屋義賣券之發行日期，需俟物價稍爲穩定後始可實現云。</p>

<h3>牛乳品質遠遜往昔　衛生當局管理嚴格　每晨攔路採驗樣品</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕戰前本市牛奶棚，在工部局管理時，曾以其設備，品質，分爲ATT及A，B三級，共有二十八家，乳牛一九四六頭，每日產乳三六〇四二磅。其中ATT級四家，乳牛最爲淸潔，出品亦極可靠。當局對各棚之管理檢查至爲嚴密。戰後市郊各區併入市府，此項牛乳之檢查管理工作，均由衛生局專司其職，除等級仍分爲與戰前之三級外，另因南市浦東一帶之牛奶棚毫無消毒設備，乃一律列入C級。根據去年統計，全市牛奶棚共有六十五家，其中單C級者即有四十七家之多。乳牛雖較戰前增約一倍計三七五六頭，但產乳則日僅三九二六二磅。衛生局以經費拮据，人手不足，故管理檢查，迄無法發揮最大功能，致自下除若干洋商牧塲及少數之中國牧塲，因有優良之消毒設備，故尚能爲用戶所放心訂飲外，餘則不免稍存戒心。衛生局最近所訂檢查各牛奶棚之規則，至爲嚴密，如乳牛，乳汁，飼畜，乳塲，環境，擠乳，裝瓶等均加注意，同時每晨並派員專在途中攔截送牛奶者，將牛奶加以採驗。自本年一月至五月，共計採驗樣品四五九件，分作細菌及化學兩項檢驗，其中不合格者計有七十件，比例尚小。但六月份一月中，檢查八十五件，而不合格者竟佔三十二件之多，時屆夏令，飲用牛乳者，實應加以留意。關於牛乳中細菌，如經煮沸，則尚無大碍，惟最懼係牛乳食有結核菌，嬰兒飲用，危險至大。至本市有結核病之乳牛，究有若干，迄尚無正式統計，此則有望衛生當局作一全盤檢查，嚴格取締病牛，俾予飲用牛乳之市民能獲得安全之保障。</p>
<h3>擴大檢查不潔飮食　決組織清潔督導團</h3>
<p>市衛生局以時屆夏令盛暑，市民健康至關重要，爲確保市民夏令健康，並加善防範不潔飲料起見，除已組織街頭冷飲巡查隊，經常巡視，嚴格取締不潔冷飲外，現決再組織一淸潔督導團，擴大檢查一切不潔飲食範圍，除攤販外，各酒菜店及冷飲店亦將施以嚴格檢查。聞該隊隊長已決定由該局楊銘鼎處長兼任云。</p>
<h3>合作事業視察團　今舉行檢討會議</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕本市合作事業視察團，曾於上月五日起至二十八日止，分組前往各業合作社視察，茲已全部　事。社會局合作科定於今日午後，邀集參加視察之各單位，舉行檢討會議，出席單位爲市參議會，中國農民銀行，中央合作金庫，社會部合作事業供銷處，市黨部，市商會，總工會等。昨據社局合作科長鄒今揆語記者稱：「視察團此次曾往視察之各類合作社，共三百餘單位，一般成績尚合標準。視察團并擬選擇成績最優良之少數單位，作爲示範合作社，將來由本市金融及物資機關予以扶植。至少數不合標準之單位，將於今日會議檢討後，予以解散」。</p>

<h3>無國籍人金鈔案　牽涉十五國人民　證物有美鈔鑽石美軍身份證等</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕無國籍人奧白蘭斯（Hans＇Obrenz），前以查有經營黑市金鈔罪嫌，經警局經警大　於上月廿一日逮捕偵訊後，業於日前移送特刑庭法辦。據警局消息：奧白蘭斯經營黑市金鈔罪嫌之人國籍多至十五國。先是，警局於本年四月間，卽接獲關於奧之密報，當即對奧加以監視為迨該項密報偵訊屬實後，經警大隊即於上月廿日上午十時，開始行動，搜查奧之寓所，並將奧逮捕。警局旋即根據搜獲之瞪件翻以訊問。奧對經營黑市金鈔各種非法行爲，直認不諱。旋警局復根據奧之口供，傳訊若千關係人，對其非法行爲，復獲得不少綫索。然該案牽涉之若干人，以暫時或永久居住國外，行蹤一時不明。惟經警大隊表示，決不放棄調查，一有可能，且即將採取行動。茲探誌奧所犯各案情形大要如次：</p>
<p>三案牽涉　債務糾紛</p>
<p>第一案牽涉吉爾勃（Felix　Gilbert）及高資曼（Kctzmann）兩人。前者現在澳洲，後者行蹤不明。士在滬時，奧曾向渠借得美金一千元，惟不久即吿償還。後又向吉借得美金一千元，結果會付還吉本金二二〇美元，利息七二一美元。旋吉赴澳，即將對奧之債權，轉移於高資受。奧承認渠曾以美鈔淸償舊欠之差額，惟因與高另有洽定，故賞僅付一百美元</p>
<p>第二案牽涉蘭道（Landan）及法蘭克（Frenkl）兩人，現兩人均在澳。　承認為還債　係，會付　道（法蘭克之代表）五十美元　第三案牽涉一名紐門夫人（Mrs．Trude　Neumann）者，係一法幣債務之糾紛案。</p>
<p>美金支票　兌現遭退</p>
<p>第四案係屬非法買賣外幣支票。奧自一瑞典籍船主名勃立南（Bryer）者，購得美金支票二百元一紙，轉售予一美國飛機師。經該飛機師將支票寄往美國兌現，結果竟以存款不足而遭退票。　第五案亦牽涉兩外人。證件有瑞士銀行本年五月廿一日所發債務淸單一紙。</p>
<p>第六案又牽涉兩外人，一名愛夫者，擬向奧借款美金三千元，允付月息共五二五美元。奧向另一外人名皮氏者，取得借款，惟言明五二五美元月息中，奧應得佣一二五美元。</p>
<p>第七案牽涉之三外人，其中一人現在北平，亦爲一飛機師。該案內情複雜，牽涉金額美金一千元。</p>
<p>第八案警局刻尚未獲得物證。惟奧承認曾於上月十九日，按黑市行情，兌予外籍琪夫人美鈔五十元。</p>
<p>金鎊一個　來自街頭</p>
<p>第九案中，警局搜獲金鎊一個，美鈔六八八元，承認係向街頭各式人士搜購而來，人名不詳。</p>
<p>第十案中發現奧持有兩美國軍人之身份證。該案以關係人係屬於美國軍事法規所管轄，警局已將案由移送美軍情報部調查，迄未獲得覆文。</p>
<p>第十一案牽涉鑽石三顆，外人兩名。該案現雖乏物證，惟奧已承認第一顆鑽石係向某商業銀行一華籍職員購得。該鑽係以美金作價，成交時按美金時値，折合佚幣付款。第二顆鑽石係以美金三百元，向寓居虹口之一德籍猶太難民購得。第三顆鑽石，則係以法幣購得。奧後以鑽石一顆，售予克爾缺勒士（Culltsust），得美金九二〇元，另一顆則作價美金三五〇元，與另一猶太難民成交。</p>
<p>據警局表示，上述十一案中，除第三第十兩案，並不構成犯罪行爲外，奧已承認在短短之八個月間，自蹈法　之案件竟達九起，自當依法治以應得之罪</p>

<h3>聯合電廠　實現無期　傳美援代表調查後　對此計劃興趣減低</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕中美聯合電力公司之計劃，原在美援建設專款中佔一重要之地位，美方預定投資二千萬美金，以五年之時間元成此計劃，使本市今後今永無缺電之虞，並爲將來之工業擴張作準備。惟近傳自美援代表團來滬調查後，認爲依目前我國計算電費之標準，現有之電廠將不能維持，遑論擴大及建立新廠，故對原定聯合電力公司之計劃，已不感興趣云云。記者爲明悉眞相起見，昨日時訪問有關高級人員，據謂：聯合電力公司之計劃是否執行，尚在擬議之中，史梯爾曼調查團內，對此事之意見並不一致，惟史氏本人則主張實現此計劃。此事之決定權，事實上操於美政府之手，待史氏赴美述職完畢再度來華時，方有定奪。聞美援運用會方面，對解決電荒有另一種方案，即主張增加現有電廠之發電能力，因聯合電廠須五年方可成功，在此期內電力不能增加，實有緩不濟急之感，惟此間規模最大之電力公司，對實現聯合電廠之理想，仍具信心，並認爲電費問題，遲早將由中國政府予以合理之解決。又據悉，美援運用會秘書長沈熙瑞表示：美方不滿電費過低則有之，對聯合電廠計劃消極，則並無所聞云。</p>

<h3>星期論壇　本年下半年預算論（下）（續昨）</h3>
<p>— 張白衣</p>
<p>筆者認爲：政府今日已擁有二大財源，即一爲美國援助四億美元，二爲國有財產（包括美國剩餘物資，租借物資，敵僞產業，日本賠償物資，國營事業機構），實已具備改革貨幣之先決條件。政府今日不妨依據最近物價四百萬倍（亦即現在銀元之市價約數）爲定新貨幣與法幣之交換率，即法幣四百萬元調換新幣一元。政府在此時可以發行新貨幣二億五千萬元即可較回全部法幣。如此人民對於貨幣恢復信心，有餘貨幣所得仍將存入銀行，銀行即可恢復原有銀行之職能，從而控制國民購置力，且有充分融通農工生產之資金。一俟法幣完全收回後，政府不妨宣布中央銀行完全與財政部脫離關係而獨立，代理國庫業務仍可委託中央銀行，但中央銀行以後不再負國庫墊教之義務。此後中央銀行國庫局如發覺國庫存款不足時，可請財政部發行新公債或抵押物資以彌補之。中央銀行獨立後，中央銀行發行之兌換券信用可增加千倍至萬倍，幣信確立後，亦可使財政部債信恢復，財政部發行公債或短期國庫券自能順利銷訖。惟依據筆者訂算，本年度下半年度可以不必發行公債庫劵。</p>
<p>新貨幣發行二億五千萬固元可心回全部法幣，但新貨幣發行，二億五千萬元，對於全部市場當然尚感不敷需要。倘欲增加至戰前水準十四億元，豈非變爲變相通貨膨脹乎？但事實不然，屆時新貨幣恢復貨幣信用後，今日黑市流通之黃金，美鈔，外幣，銀元，米及其他代替法幣地位之「實物貨幣」之價値，必全部失去，此等「實物貨幣」原有之流通空間範圍，將爲新貨幣所佔據。例如都市房屋租賃決不再以黃金美鈔爲收付工具，鄉村亦將停止以白米及銀元爲收付工具。新貨幣因佔據一實物貨幣一之流通空間而引起之發行需要，決不會影響物價，故對於新貨幣本身價値決不因之而貶低。</p>
<p>改革幣制後預算計算單位將改新幣，筆者所擬預算試案當如下列：</p>
<p>三十七年下半年度國家預算試案（單位新幣元）歲入之部</p>
<p>一·租稅收入　二五〇、〇〇〇、〇〇〇</p>
<p>二·借款收入　五〇〇、〇〇〇、〇〇〇</p>
<p>三·國有財產收入　一、一六二、五〇〇、〇〇〇</p>
<p>（一）美國剩餘物資及租借物資變價收入　七五、〇〇〇、〇〇〇</p>
<p>（二）敵僞財產物資變價收入　二五、〇〇〇、〇〇〇</p>
<p>（三）日本賠償物資變價收入　三、五〇〇、〇〇〇</p>
<p>（四）國營事業變價收入　八〇〇、〇〇〇、〇〇〇</p>
<p>（五）國營事業利潤收入　二五〇、〇〇〇，〇〇〇</p>
<p>歲入總計　一、九三、五〇〇、〇〇〇</p>
<p>歲出之部</p>
<p>一·軍警支出　八七五、〇〇〇、〇〇〇</p>
<p>二·經濟建設支出　六二五、〇〇〇、〇〇〇</p>
<p>三·其他政務費支出　四三、〇〇〇、〇〇〇</p>
<p>歲出總計　一九三、五〇〇、〇〇〇</p>
<p>租稅收入二億五千萬元，較戰前遙爲低下。依據財政部報吿，民國二十五年度租稅收入（國庫實收）達十億五千七百萬元，行政事業收入達三千六百萬元。租稅收入中關稅收入計有六億三千六百萬元，鹽稅收入二億四千七百萬元，統稅收入一億三千一百萬元。故筆者所定二億五千萬元，對於工商負担能力當不爲過。借款收入爲依據業已簽訂借款協定之美國援助借款，以美金二億五千萬元折合新幣五億元係依據現行自由匯率及國內物價。即新幣二元等於美金一元。因美金戰爭時亦已發生通貨膨脹，由戰前六十億元增至今日二百八十億元左右，事實上已增加三倍有半，但因美國物資生產量亦有增加，故以新幣二元對美一元亦不爲過。</p>
<p>但此處特別値得注意者，爲中國內債償遷問題。此項內債包括在國內發行之一切法幣公債關金公債美金公債英鎊公債及美金庫劵。倘此等公債均以新幣償付其本息，則國庫決無此項負担能力，倘欲勉爲維持債信，則祗有促成財政破產。但如因償債困難而不實行幣制改革，則其弊害已如前述。凡事必有利弊兩面，其政策之抉擇當在其利弊之比較如何而定。筆者認爲，政府對於此項公債惟有另案辦理。改革幣制始可健全財政，故改革幣制有利無弊，縱因償債問題而感有弊害，但其弊害之程度遠較不改革幣制之弊害爲輕。且幣制不改，公債持有人之損失亦已成爲旣成事實，故幣制改革爲應有而迫切之舉措。筆者建議，幣制改革後對於公債之處理原則有二，可選擇其一，一爲所有內國公債全部凍結，實行無限期之停止償付本息，一俟財政國庫有力償付本息時再恢復償付。二爲實行公債調換制，將所有內國公債一律調換爲新的統一公債，包括金公債在內。按各種公債原始實際價格再打劃一之折扣而調換新幣本位公債，其賠淸時期亦延長至今後四五十年乃至一百年。此問題頗爲重要，政府必須愼重爲之</p>
<p>政府對於租稅微課技術亦有改革之必要。稅務行政系統之一切徵稅員未必個個貪汚，但觀乎最近來各稅務機關食汚案之層疊出現，我人必須加以特別注意。政府雖爲此事有審計系統之成立，公庫系統之確立，財政部國庫署亦有巡迴稽核之設置，但貪汚案件依然盛行。吾人須知，假如徵稅人員與納稅者狼狽爲奸，可能使國庫稅收减少一半以上。筆者前曾提出政府設立一種工商統一稅，類乎包稅制度，由各地工商同業團體自行直接繳納各地代庫銀行。此種方法旣可增加國庫稅收，又可便利工商，更可省却政府一筆相當可觀之徵稅支出。筆者認爲可以改爲工商統一稅之種類有工商界所得稅，營利事業所得稅，工商薪給報酬所得稅，證券存款所得稅，財產出賣所得稅，財產租賃所得稅，非常時期過分利得稅，營業稅，貨物出口稅，礦產稅，貨物稅中之棉紗稅，麥粉稅，水泥稅，火酒稅，飲料品稅，糖類稅，茶葉我，竹木稅，皮毛稅，磁器稅，紙箔稅，火柴稅，捲菸稅等，貨物取締稅，均可一律撤銷，而完全歸併於工商統一稅，由各地工商團體與財政部約定一數額而分四季微收。例如在上海假定工商統一稅爲現在法幣年納二百萬億元，然後由工商團體兩者自認定若干而由工商團體分別向各工廠各商店通知認繳。如果實行此法，深信工商界亦當歡迎。</p>
<p>在出售國有財產前，必須考慮財政政策之有無自相矛盾。例如今日政府一面計劃出售敵僞產業，剩餘物資，租借物資及日本賠償物資，但一而又在計劃徵收財產稅。政府計劃徵收財產稅以求增加租稅收入，减少通貨膨脹，在原則上似頗合理；但要知在此資金不斷外流及工廠與出口商等之大量遷至特殊區域香港之現時，如再欲徵收財產稅，勢必促其勇向海外逃避。同時旣欲徵收財產稅又欲變賣國有財產，試問有資者誰更願購買國有財產？增加稅收彌補赤字固爲健全財政之基礎，但亦須由經濟觀點而考盧其有無弊害，倘其弊害程度影鄉於稅源及整個國計民生，則必須避免。矧目前財源已無問題，故財產稅徵收案似可作罷。且財產稅爲對稅率徵收之稅，除非於萬不得已時始可姑且嘗試。</p>
<p>但改革幣制亦須相當時日，決非一歸可行。惟財政刊算欲期健全，又非立即改爲新幣單位不可。在此遞嬻過程，筆者認爲可由下述之方法解決此問題。即本年下半年度預算立即以新幣爲單位計算，但不立即公布。同時在改革幣制之前，政府最好發行一種改革幣制準備備蓄金證劵，以黃金一兩爲單位，每兩以一億五千萬元至三億元作價，無息，期問爲一年，發行量爲一百萬至五百萬兩，到期遷本黃金一兩或等於黃金一兩之新幣。此種改革幣制準備儲蓄金證券之發行，一方可以證明政府決心於一定期間改革幣制，他方又可以保證以法幣購買儲蓄金證劵者價値絕對保持。政府若藉此而吸收數百萬億元法幣，即可控制數百萬億元法幣之國民購買力，使國民之購買力不再流於美鈔，法幣，外匯，黃金，銀元，貨物之市塲空間，從而促成物價之平衡與貨幣之穩定，改革幣制時得以順利進行。或謂政府屆時如無此項黃金還本，勢必發生問題，但因有新幣還本，此問題必能圓滿解決。蓋購買此項金證券者之目的，原爲求保持其貨幣價値，屆時黃金與新幣價値穩定時，不問對於黃金或新幣，將均所歡迎。例如戰時實行黃金存款時，曾有不少人民願於到期時領遷法幣，蓋當時黃金價格未有如何變動也。</p>
<p>總之，我國財政，雖經抗戰八年及戡亂三年，但因抗戰結束後有大量敵僞物資之收歸國有，大量敵性工廠之變爲國營事業，更有大量賠償物資之獲得，故財政之基礎相當健全。此外更有外國借款之獲得，美國剩餘物資及租借物資及救濟物資之獲得，財政照例並無困難。加之戰後租稅徵收區域之增大，由各主要工廠區域之收復及生產恢復，租稅之收入亦應增加。更因國際貿易之恢復，關稅收入自不能與戰時相比。一個戰勝國家旣有賠償收入及外國借款收入，而竟使財政無法解決，致使仍恃通貨膨脹爲主要政策，豈非天下之奇事？（下篇完）</p>
<h3>兩艘新軍艦　重慶號·靈甫號</h3>
<p>— 本報約記者　子健</p>
<p>〔本報香港七月廿九日航訊〕喧傳兩月的英贈艦兩艘「重慶號」與「靈甫號」，廿八日上午十時許，在暴風雨過後而仍帶黯淡的天色中，駛進南中國門戶的香港來。剛剛下碇後幾小時，「靈甫號」驅逐艦便奉命出海搜尋一艘第四海軍區所屬的一艘小型巡邏艇，可見國家需用這兩新艦是如何的迫切，而毋怪僑胞對他歡迎的熱烈和期待的迫切了。</p>
<p>僑胞聞訊後，紛紛趕到海傍出觀，但他們看看報上刋出新艦的維姿猶可，跑出海岸觀看則不可了，因爲新艦却奉一他人之命」停泊在市區外的九龍灣頭，在啓德飛機塲之外，乘電船前往，也須一小時以上的航程。過去一般外國軍艦駛進香港，大都下碇於海軍船塢附近或西環的海面，這回却引至一個冷淸淸的灣頭。當某報記者登「重慶號」巡洋艦訪問艦長鄧兆祥上校的時候，便帶請求的口吻，問他可否把兩艦駛近市區海面，讓僑胞先覩爲快，他答道：「這可有心無力，還請僑胞原諒」！原來他在途中，亦即在僑團開會籌備歡迎的當兒，便接到本港海軍通知抵港時下綻的地點了。</p>
<p>艦上健兒的服裝和設備，全部英國式，有一個年靑的小伙子，居然也留了鬍子，活像一個英國老水兵。他們聽過了第四海軍區的楊司令蒞艦訓話後，便有一部份獲得登岸遊覽的休假，於是僑胞才有一個眞正　到祖國新海軍英姿的機會。</p>
<p>新艦在港已接受僑團編好了五天日招待程表，歡迎與期待兼而有之。若不是當駛抵國門的前刻與暴風雨搏鬥而致「靈甫號」的機件有些發生障碍，須待入塢小修，則在七天之內將可駛進黃浦江和親愛的同胞作見面禮了。</p>
<h3>常熟沙洲區血案　保長兩名遭慘殺</h3>

<h3>關外行（二）　赤金堡夢尋</h3>
<p>— 本報記者　宋麟</p>
<p>〔本報酒泉七月廿八日航訊〕在玉門老君廟油礦一住便是六天，連日參觀了生產管理各部門，使大家如入山陰道上，目不暇接。七月十五日晨九時，與老君廟那四根擎天的巨柱揮別之後，記者團專車又向西北馳上戈壁。</p>
<p>車行廿五公里，遇礦警隊盤查哨，和入礦區時在靑雲路所遇的盤查哨一樣。僅僅問明白是記者團專車以後，便放行了。再行五公里許，在戈壁的邊緣，忽然出現一塊綠洲，這便是赤金堡油礦，有一個農場設在這裏。</p>
<p>赤金堡是玉門縣轄地，因爲不在公路上，大家很少注意到它。迨我們親臨其境，才驚訝它的美點，是凌駕關外各地的。路北靑紅兩色的砂岩構成的小山，是祁述山的餘脈，與路南一大片油綠的農田，色彩成强烈的對比，鮮艷瑰麗。山麓有紅山寺，依山構築，玉門油礦農塲的辦公室便設在山下寺內。一泓淸溪，繞寺而過，山脚有高塔一座，已見傾圯，一行行白楊蕭蕭，綠柳隨風招展，三五牛馬，漫步田間，寺邊園圃裏，更栽植許多名貴的花卉，以備運往老君廟礦區陳設　這個農塲係卅一年開闢，原有田一百畝，去年又在赤金堡東湖領田五千八百畝，已開墾了一百畝，其餘的四千八百畝，也準備在三年內墾完。據該場的主任朱建功說，該塲現有職員二人，率工人二百五十人耕作，所種植的除了小麥以外，以冬菜爲大宗出產，每年冬天運到汕礦的白菜有兩三萬株，蘿葡尤多，該塲現有牛·羊·騾·馬等百餘頭，飼豬二百六十頭，僅够礦區同仁過一個年或節。</p>
<p>我們步入農塲辦公室大門，迎頭便見正廳一塊立匾：「屯墾員堂」，正廳內又懸一副對聯，均爲于學業所書，聯上隸書寫着：「遵總裁誥訓，樹建國一等事業；繼班馬遺徽，揚先哲不死精神。「對聯雖然並不好，但在此時此地看到，聯想起這幾天對油礦建設艱苦締造的印象，使我們大爲感動。　正廳作會客室之用，壁上懸有原素欣，趙鳳起等題字，並有赤金八景的名稱：「駝鈴驚夢」，「收笛晚唱」，「祁連殘雪」，「戈壁輕烟」，「白塔寒雁」，「古佛幽巖」，「紅山石鍋」，「金牛淸水」，除金牛和石鍋已湮不可考外，因爲這兒是唐代的綫路，爲一大驛站，關於「古佛幽嚴」在下面將說到外，其餘的情景的吻合，是不難想到的。　關於「古佛幽巖」，在我參觀過敦煌的塑像後，才知道紅山寺塑的唐此較完整。前而說過，紅山寺依山建築，全部有紅山寺，碧雲洞，紫霞洞，觀音巖，魁星樓數殿，棟宇峨巍　，浮屠高聳，據寺內光緒五年碑載，原寺因懸有唐貞觀問尉遲敬德「光照大千」的鐵匾，大概這寺的興建也在唐代。不過後來淸代同治二年罹回亂兵燹，驛亭館舍，居民房屋，盡成灰　，寺院也遭回祿，鐵匾自然也找不到了。現在的寺院是光緒五年重建，各寺院壁盡，塑像，都很拙劣，其中唯有觀音巖一洞的佛像，尙屬完整。因爲是鑿洞而塑，可能是整個的紅山寺被毀滅時洞口合龍而獨存的。那裏面的光綫不足，空氣乾燥，五尊或坐或立的菩薩和兩座面貌獰猙的護法神，其結構和曲綫均屬上乘，尤其是面部表情，有的慈祥愷悌，有的垂眉默坐，而這稱神情，甚至在手指上都表達得出來　我們在咀嚼着「駝鈴駕夢」這一種幽古的情調中吃過中飯，天已下起雨來，農場同仁勸我們住宿這兒，聽一聽深夜的駝鈴，但我們急念想趕到玉門或安西去，所以謝過他們的美意，在下午一時四十五分冒雨登程。　整個的赤金堡籠罩在濛濛的細雨裏，色調明快而生動，現在只有兩千多戶居民，在砂漠裏的綠洲上，辛勤的耕作，做着悠長而古老的夢。……</p>

<p>一週經濟　中國工商協會主編</p>
<h3>一般物價　各手緩步上升　大體走勢尚穩</h3>
<p>上週物價，承前期末疲勢之後，週初開盤，因利空消息紛傳，各物多在穩檔徘徊，嗣因利空消息未能證實，且市上銀根鬆弛，各物又呈緩步上升之勢，大體言之，走勢尙穩　分類物品中，食物，建築材料等類回落，紡織品，化學品，燃料，金屬等類上升，本刋所編之批發物價總指數爲四·七四〇·三四八倍，較前週漲百分之二·〇一。銀根普呈鬆濫現象，國行交換迭有差出，暗息約站五六角光景。</p>
<p>上週政府經濟措施，其與今後物價較有密切關係者，約有下列數端：</p>
<p>第一，自去年二月，政府頒布經濟緊急措施，禁止飾金買賣以來，條已一年有餘。此間國家經濟狀况，固未見好轉，而黃金黑　市交易，亦從未絕跡。　最近滬市當局批准該業之請求，在政院正式批准以前，可先試　行恢復飾金買賣，其價格係按照　結匯證明書市價加美匯基準價，　按美匯與黃金之法定比例，每兩　黃金合四十美元折成，再加合法利潤百分之二十，營業費用百分之四十，工資百分之五十。依此折算，週一飾金每兩兌進價爲三億二千萬元，兌出爲三億六千萬元。</p>
<p>據該業公會理事長稱，爲避免社會人士引起刺激物價之錯覺起見，對於兌換飾金，抱量入爲出態度。關於開放飾金買賣的利弊，爭論不一，本刋不擬在這兒預測它的前途，一切讓讀者自已去判斷吧。</p>
<p>第二，關於開放自備外匯一案，漸近實施階段，輸管會主委霍寳樹，於週四招待進出口商及新聞界，報吿要點如次：</p>
<p>行政院在本月廿一日第八次會議中，通過僑資及國人在外資金投資國內生產事業辦法，業經在報紙公佈，其精神所在，吾人可略加說明：</p>
<p>（一）補充生產工具：十年以來，國內生產事業迭遭破讓，亟　補充恢復。戰爭期內，國內廠　多有在國外訂購機器者，此時亟需進口，而國外僑胞其希望投資國內生產事業者，自應予以便利。</p>
<p>（二）補充生產原料，此辦法中，第八條中規定准許　資帶回國內所需之主要原料，原料項目請見附表，此類原料，皆爲國內所缺乏，且爲美援所未曾包括，而華僑居留地則爲主要生產地者。</p>
<p>（三）配合國內工業需要：目前公佈之附表中，所列原料，皆爲國內異常缺乏者，將來公佈時，仍將與工業需要相配合。凡國內已敷應用者，不予進口，缺乏即予補充。</p>
<p>（四）限額制仍然保持：本辦法目的，在於補充工業原料之不足，因國內原料異常缺乏，故限額制仍然保持。　我們覺得當前物價問題的嚴重，生產不足確是一個很重要的原因，但是生產不足，又是來自原料缺乏，故此次當局的措施，尙屬針對事實的改進。不過不必要的管制，存在的還多，希望當局努力去一一解除。</p>
<p>第三，關於經濟管制局之設立問題，本刋前已報導，聞此次總統在莫干山召開之會，曾討論及此，是否設立，似尙在考慮之中。此案殊爲滬上工商界人士所關注。</p>
<p>第四，上海金融管理局，查獲本市中國工礦銀行，有設立暗帳，另立字號，套用行款兼營商業行爲，特呈准財政部，令該行自廿九日起響停營　。同時該行漢口分行，因犯有以上同樣行爲，亦由金管局呈清財部令飭於即日起暫停營業。此案詳細情形，尙朱見常局明白公佈，但這無疑的是金管局成立以來所做的一件大事。</p>
<p>上週商品市塲走勢，因多空兩方，互相控制，除紗布於週五曾創新高價外，大多漲落互見，幅度不大。糧食方面，因到多銷淡，價微下落，如上白粳由週初之四千萬步落至週五之三千六七百萬。但週末因受配給米售價提高之刺激，立見　升，白粳昂達四千三百萬。油粉因去路尙佳，價緩步上升，如　末靑島吉桶生油站一一，八〇〇萬，兵船一號粉站一，一一五〇萬。</p>
<p>紗布市塲，因紗管會曾一度停配，兼之銀根鬆强，價頗有上升，週五曾創新紀錄，四十二支藍鳳站二一六，〇〇〇萬，廿一支雙馬站一七七，〇〇〇萬，龍頭細布站五，七〇〇〇萬。日用品如皂火等過程，多在疲落後回升。他類物品中，金屬上升約一成餘，餘尙平穩。</p>

<h3>貨幣金融</h3>
<p>（一）銀根暗息</p>
<p>本市銀根走勢，在前週週末，即已轉現鬆和，上週銀根，固未出所料，益見全面鬆弛了。市塲頭寸的多寡，亦無非受供求原則的支配，決定上週銀根轉弛的原因，歸納起來，不出下曰幾個：</p>
<p>（一）這半個月來，對於政局的某種謠傳頗盛，商塲是最敏感的，由是造成了賣者求售買者觀望的局面。一般物價旣未因大鈔的發行而立見陡漲，頭寸的搜求自不若過去之殷切。這可說是決定銀根鬆弛的需求方面的因素。</p>
<p>（二）至於供源方面，不但有外埠匯款的連續湧來，而國家行局，値此物價低潮期間，收購民間物資更不進餘力。其間如中農銀行，支付麵粉款項，六日內即達三萬億之鉅。　國庫支出浩繁，行局一週來，竟大部均吿差出。頭寸不但自各方源源供出，而且再加上供多而求少，銀根自然就一天比一天鬆弛了。</p>
<p>商業行莊方面，調用頭寸甚爲靈便。業內多單普遍，甚至有以單子存於央行，以備隔日取用現鈔者。因此一週來同業拆放寥落異常。六十號以後行莊交換結果，假如以台灣銀行於週四及週五兩天的二萬五千四百十二億差出不計，自週一至週五之實際差出，不過一萬四千八百卅三億，較前週同期內减出達四萬八千七百餘億之鉅。</p>
<p>上週市間暗息大致在五角上下，顯然比前週合七角以上的日拆跌落多了。而週四濫單一度供出，合息不過三角六分，週五暗息亦續跌至四角以下，實爲近所罕見。至於現鈔籌碼，供源雖以大鈔的發行而轉旺，但因各地鈔荒嚴重，外流者頗多，致大鈔仍有貼水現象。</p>
<p>國家行局，以收購物資結匯證及解付歐款等支出，自週一至週五計共差出二萬四千五百〇五億，較前週同期內猶增出三萬一千九百餘億。</p>
<p>上週外商銀行差進額，雖因吸進結匯證等支出而不若前週者爲鉅，但自週一至週五，仍見差進三萬二千六百三十八億。較前週减進達四萬三千四百〇九億，這對上週銀根的全面轉弛，亦起相當作用。</p>
<p>（二）內外匯率</p>
<p>上週商業行莊內匯匯率，在銀根趨鬆聲中，亦普見回升，考其原委，不外因銀根轉鬆後，客戶匯款冗繁，而行莊亦無需以低匯水吸取匯款之故。</p>
<p>至於華甫區匯率所以高於華中華北各區，無非象徵資金的繼續南逃而已。上週穗匯匯水週一週二爲二百五十元，週三雖一度跌落二十元，個週四又上升至三百元。週五則與週四同。</p>
<p>厦門匯水自週一至週五，始終穩站四百元之高盤。渝匯週二以前爲平匯，週三改爲匯水七十元，週四猛升至一百五十元。週五再升至二百元。</p>
<p>漢匯匯水週一爲八十元，週二升至一百元，週五又見一百二十元的新水準。</p>
<p>津匯在週三以前爲貼水二十元，週四週五均升爲平匯，可知北方游資來滬者較前减少。　上週外匯行市，結匯證仍見盤旋疲局，成交價格大致在三百八十萬至三百八十五萬之間。　銀樓業飾金雖已公開買賣，但以央行不負責供給金條或金塊，致開業後飾金之兌出多於收進，而交易情况頗見情淡。</p>
<p>香港申匯，上半週稍見放長，十萬法幣合港幣九分，但週四又縮短爲八分。香港美鈔市價，自週一至週四，起落於港幣五元四角至四角二分之間，又黃金每華兩以週三爲高，達三百三十五元五角，週一不過三百二十七元半，週四又見跌至三百三十一元。</p>
<p>（三）華洋股市</p>
<p>華股週初開擊，承前週末創痛之餘，略見回蘇，但挺勢不久又挫，午後因外象物價平痰，港匯放長，人心虛軟，價陡下，爲近旬來罕見局面，永紗曾一度跌停，結果以九八五〇元低價收盤·餘股除信誼·中法·等五種上升外，均一致下降·　次日因銀根鬆，外象穩，物極必反，人心帶倘，各股脫疲轉堅，多種漲停，永紗以一〇八三五元，在漲限收市。</p>
<p>週三因圈外物價報漲，開放自備外匯之說日近事實，工商繁榮有望，雖多空搏鬥，迭有起伏，結果一致軋漲，永紗漲六百五十元，景輪·中法·兩種漲停，他股軋升半成至近二成不等·　週四聞中國工礦銀行停止交換，意興蘭珊，逢高有售，過程倐忽不定，結果永紗漲一百二十元，以一一五七〇元收盤·永業·聯華·兩種漲停，信和等七種軋漲，餘均轉疲。</p>
<p>週五因銀根　，買氣濃厚，市氣激騰，多種進入漲限，終以買方不無顧慮，獲利吐售，如永紗於數度進入漲限後又見破限，結果除中法獨跌外，均見上漲。計永紗以一二六〇〇元收盤，榮豐·聯華·兩種漲停，他股上漲成數不等。</p>
<p>週末因總統蒞滬，人心恍惚，各帮吐售，除統益·恒豐·五和·永公·梅林等五種軋漲外，他股多微趨下降。</p>
<h3>工商動態</h3>
<p>從部份開放自備外匯辦法看工商</p>
<p>根據合衆社南京七月廿七日電訊，權威方面透露，行政院在原則上已批准中國外匯管制政策的所謂兩大變革；其一爲允許進口商以其自備外匯輸入生產器材及原料，其二爲允許海外僑胞以運貨進口之方式匯款返國。</p>
<p>果然，上月廿八日，行政院即公佈了僑資及國人在外存款投資生產事業申請輸入辦法的全文，接着本市輸管會，亦於廿九日正式宣佈了辦法的實施細則。</p>
<p>根據政院所公佈的辦法，得知自備外匯及僑資，在符合當局的規定下，可利用以輸入生產事業所需用的生產器材及原料，此處所謂生產事業，規定係指工礦農林漁收水利事業，公用事業，交通事業，農產加工出口事業及手工業而言。</p>
<p>不但如此，辦法更明文規定，此類生產事業之擴充與舉辦須適合兩個前提，第一爲其事業確爲國內所需要或能增加輸出者，第二爲所辦事業需用之主要原料，半數以上能取給於國內者。至於生產原料之輸入，辦法中規定限於國內缺乏且爲美援所未曾包括者。値得注意的是，辦法的第七條嚴禁輸入物資的轉讓他人，但第八條却另爲此種輸入物資的轉售開闢途徑，途徑之一爲經輸管會核准，直接售與需用該項物資的生產事業機構，途徑之二爲委託政府指定之機關代售。</p>
<p>由此不難看出，政府想利用這一辦法，引誘在美援中所缺如的這一部份物資的輸入，最後並加以掌握之。</p>
<p>至於辦法，是否能達到扶植生產事業發展的目的呢？則必須從最近以來的工商界動態中予以理解。</p>
<p>先就新辦法所正名的所謂生產事業之一的公用事業而論，上週週二，市府爲挽救公用事業危機，曾舉行討論會。會中各公用事業公司，均有書面報吿，歷述各公司財政上之困難。</p>
<p>據悉其間如上海電力公司，六月份虧蝕三萬餘億，七月份虧蝕估計爲二萬億。英商上海自來水公司，自廿六年十二月卅一日至本年七月份，虧蝕總數達一萬四千多億；上海煤氣公司，七月份預計虧損二千餘億；其他如電話公司，法商電車電燈公司，公共交通公司等，莫不於近月來虧損達數千億元以上。在這樣一個局面下，公用事業能否擴充其設備　營業，實在很難使人樂觀。</p>
<p>次就紡織業而論，不但原料困難，外銷亦感離於開展。據現經社消息，中紡現在存於內地的棉花不過十一萬餘担，而且運輸極爲困難。從去年到今年花紗布管委會原期收花二百萬担，結果只收到五十萬担，今年情形，據說更不能樂觀。說到原棉供源之一的印棉，日來價格亦上漲，十六分之十三吋長度棉花，每磅漲至一千一百餘盧比。</p>
<p>國內收購工作，據紡建公司總經理表示，自各地發生銀元交易後，收風大受阻碍。此外如煤電之缺乏，戰火的漫燒，及軍需的浩大，雖紡建公司，亦感難於支持。</p>
<p>至於外銷方面，日貨競爭的威脅性，可謂與日俱增，據上週週一中央社訊，自日本投降迄至本年六月底，共已輸出價値數十億日圓之紡織品，其中包括棉布五億一千四百萬碼，紡織品之輪出，已居日本出口之首位。</p>
<p>駐日盟軍總部紐約國外貿易辦事處，最近更宣佈十三種日本棉織品削碼出售，另據日本貿易局長永井宣稱，今年度日本民間貿易較去年已增二倍。棉紡織業在重重打擊之下，南遷香港者已經不少，則所謂獎勵僑資歸國，從事建設，前途自更難預測。　再如以輪船業而論，不但航行成本激增，與運價脫節，而美援物資，中國輪船只能承運百分之廿五，長江京漢兩口岸是否開放，亦已成啞謎。最近日本輪船更赴台灣運糖及秦皇島運煤，民間航權損失不少，航業已感無法維持。在政府控制之下的僑資物資進口以後，是否能增加航業所需的煤柴油等的供應，甚至擴充其器材設備，也只能事證明了。</p>
<p>工商界的危機，本刋歷有綜述。此次部份開放自備外匯辦法，能否挽救工商危機於萬一，固難預測。但最近香港「遠東經濟評論」，曾發表討論中國游資避港一文，殊値得借鏡。據該文作者估計，香港各銀行存款之總額約爲十五億港幣，合美金三億五千萬元，該文認爲游資逃港，於一九三七年即開始，戰後亦因經濟情形惡化，全國不安定，資金外逃如故，結論爲若法幣仍繼續貶値，則游資之逃避，非任何限制及宣傳所可阻止，故謂此一惡事剷除之根本辦法爲停止國內外之紙幣印刷。　據此不難看出，中國目前問題的根本癥結所在，至於獎勵僑資輸入這一辦法的成效如何，本市進出口業方面的評價頗堪注意。該業業中人有認爲部份開放自備外匯，自爲吸收僑資之一良法，但渠等希望國內局勢，能日益好轉，政府對工商之維護，能更謀實際，則國外游資，方能吸收進來，否則若前數月，若干國內紗廠，尙反將已定購之關器存香港設廠，則此種趨勢仍堪憂慮云。</p>
<p>誠然，新辦法的能否成功，自須經過工商界一番嚴竣的考騐以後，才能決定的。</p>

<h3>我國世運足球隊　今日出戰土耳其　籃球隊次賽對比利時</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕中國在本屆世　大會中，能否有較佳演出，今日即可決定。中國足球隊第一次　臉，今日將在第一週賽中與强敵土耳其會師。土耳其在友誼賽中，屢次擊敗英國第一流業餘勁旅，充沛之氣力與快速之戰術，倫敦體育界譽爲有晋入決賽希望之一匹黑馬。我國足球隊抵英後，二度與美國隊非正式交鋒，俱吿得利。敎練李惠堂謂各健兒正在顚峯狀態中，並有可參與決賽之豪語，今日我足球隊之勝負，實爲舉國人士所關心者。</p>
<p>籃球隊第二戰今日下午對比利時。我國所在之第二組中，原定係以上屆世運第四名波蘭爲種子隊，因波蘭未報名加入，改以第五名之菲律賓遞補。其他五隊爲中國·韓國·伊拉克·智利·與比利時。一般預測，以我國與韓國爲最有希望奪得第二名之兩隊，不料我國第一戰，竟不幸受挫於智利，使我國晋入最後八名之前途，頓呈暗影。比利時日前與韓國會師，僅以二分小敗，而韓國之敗於種子菲律賓，亦僅差一球。由此推測，比利時實力，當亦不弱。今日之戰，我國健兒，尙須努力。我籃球主將李世僑，預計昨日可自新加坡趕抵倫敦，參加今日比賽。</p>

<h3>人類學在暨大</h3>
<p>— 許迪</p>
<p>一，人類學</p>
<p>顧名思義，人類學是研究人類本身的一門科學，我們要知道人類的來源，明瞭本身的特性，認識文化的動向，以及增進人類的和平和幸福，都需要研究人類學。　人類學的範疇至廣，包括時間上和空間上人類的一切活動，從自然科學到社會科學，因此它的內容異當博大，而對於我們的關係特別密切，所以在歐美先進國家，人類學早經成爲一門極重要的科學，提倡研究不遺餘力。</p>
<p>二，人類學系的誕生</p>
<p>當「北京人」發現的奇跡震動全世界時，人類學也曾一度引起了人們的注意，但是好景不常，稍縱即逝，研究人類學的呼聲，依舊沈寂下去了，抗戰軍興，學術工作備受阻厄，人類學自然更無發展的希望。直至勝利來臨，由於人類學本身的重要性以及當時在各方面所表現的實際需要，社會人士和政府當局才體驗到這門科學確需從速建樹起來。敎育部乃於復員伊始，調整各大學院系時，決定首先在上海國立曁南大學添設人類學系，而中國的第一個人類學系，就在三十五年秋誕生於曁大了。　敎育部爲什麼首先注意到要在曁大設立人類學系呢？這是另有一種意義的，曁大原負有華僑敎育的使命，而南洋華僑稅居之處適爲研究人類學，民族學（人類學中重要的一門）的聖地，曁大設置此系，自然更具有實際的意義。僑胞散處南洋各地，對於當地原住民族接觸頻繁，如能具備人類學，民族學各方面廣泛的知識，則在整個文化的交流上，以及個人的事業上，均將有莫大的裨益。而由研究學術的立塲言，尤有就地取材，就地發揮效能的便利和成就。故不但僑胞有研習人類學的需要，凡是有志南洋工作者，均不可忽視。</p>
<p>三，敎研的新園地</p>
<p>三，教研的新園地</p>
<p>暨大人類學系自開辦到現在，不過是二年罷了，自然距理想的境地還很遠。不過就在這短短二年中，所表現的成績，也就難能可貴了。它的一切都在整個生活不安定和經濟困難的情况下，經人爲的努力奮鬥出來的，當你看到那師生們孜孜不倦的治學精神，你就可以看出它的前途已有了充分的保證。</p>
<p>系主任劉咸敎授，是一位實幹的學者，早年在英國牛津大學專攻人類學，對人類學各部門都有廣泛的知識，並且受過嚴格的訓練，發表過許多專題研究的論著，得有碩士學位，兩次代表我國參加立斯本和巴黎的國際人類學先史學會議。被任爲倫敦國際人類學及民族學會議中國委員會永久理事。歸國後從事講學及各種學術工作多年，甚著成績，曾於二十三年領隊到海南島作黎族的調查，深入黎峒，攀登五指山絕頂，採獲標本頗多，有研究黎族的論文多篇發表，乃中國人類學界權威之一。當曁大復員開辦人類學系時，劉敎授即被聘爲系主任（並兼任理學院院長），平日敎學認眞，循循善誘，獎掖後學，不遺餘力。曁大人類學系在他主持下，進步確有可觀。</p>
<p>至於敎授陣容，堪稱整齊堅强：體質人類學敎授吳士華博士，爲國內斯學權威，卓著聲譽。人類遺傳學敎授薛仲董博士，爲斯學專家，敎學多年。担任心理學的盧于道敎授，担任社會學的應成一敎授等，都是國內各該學科的權威學者，知名之士，無須介紹。該系現正洽聘世界著名人類學家，德國艾思德敎授來華講學，將於吾國斯學之發展，有深遠的影響。　在設備方面，由於經費關係，圖書儀器分期購置，但該系業已成立的民俗標本陳列室，已具規模，極有價値，內藏八百多件民俗標本，主要的是合灣高山族的日常用具和藝術品四百餘件，及海南島黎族的三百餘件，却是很珍貴的文化資料，在國內尙不多覯。每當國內外學者們參觀到這個中國人類的新園地時，也都表示着驚奇和讚常。——的確，在這樣短期內有這樣表現，是很不容易的。</p>
<p>四，熱切的期望　這裏將曁大人類學系的輪廓，略加介紹，忠實報道，無意宣染，希望能引起國人對於人類學的注意，尤盼有志深造的靑年學子，於投考大學，選擇學科，有所認識，知所取捨。人類學是一門新興的科學，關係人類的前途至鉅，在吾國更係處女地，未來發展，詎可限量。高瞻遠矚，何去何從，是在學人。</p>

<h3>上海的假美鈔</h3>
<p>— 雨窗</p>
<p>上海的警務當局對非法經營黑市金鈔的奸商，可以說制裁得相當嚴厲，但是，利之所趨，就自有一輩人竟甘願冒着險仍舊在做這違法的買賣，祗要看金鈔案至今還當有所聞，就可知這種交易之尚未絕跡了。</p>
<p>不過，經營金鈔旣已成爲非法的秘密交易，因而就有無數喪盡天良的奸徒，乘機渾水摸魚，使被害人就是明知上了當也不能聲張，祗好「啞子吃黃通，有苦說不出」。這種奸徒的手段，却比一般所謂金鈔掮客之流的小市儈又狠毒得多了。</p>
<p>譬如說，前一陣就傳說有人把金條溶解了另鈔成色不足的金條在黑市出賣，而且當局已經捉到了與此有關的人物，想來經法院審訊之後，眞相一定就可大白。但是，上海黑市上流通着的美鈔之中，却也有爲數極鉅的大宗假鈔，這些假鈔製作極精，簡直可以亂眞—却恐怕還有許多人不知道罷？</p>
<p>美國前月出版的「世界報吿」雜誌曾刋出一封上海通訊，就報道着這批假鈔的消息。據那位記者J.F.（大概就是該雜誌社駐日本與遠東的特派員弗洛姆JosephFromm）說，上海的假美鈔，最初發現是在兩年以前，票面都是五十元和二十元的，但是從今年五月起却又大批出現了。</p>
<p>最初，上海一家美國銀行的一位職員在點鈔票的時候，忽然看見一張票面五十元的鈔票，很像是假的，他就把這張鈔票剔了出來。後來，這家銀行的當局就把這張鈔票寄到美國該銀行的總行，請求鑒定。過了幾天，總行來了答覆，原件奉還，說這張鈔票是眞的。但是那位點鈔票的職員却是一位「硬繃繃」的人物，他仔細把鈔票再看了一看，說是必假無疑；那家銀行當局倒很尊重自己職員的意見，就把這張鈔票再送到美國聯邦準備銀行（相當與我國的中央銀行）請求鑒定；回信來了，也說是眞的，而且負責鑒定的人還親自簽字負責，證明這張鈔票靠得住</p>
<p>但是，那位點鈔票朋友却仍不「服貼」，銀行當局見他耿直不阿，印象極好，就再來一試，這次是正式呈美國財政部了。財政部對此事倒極表重視，就送到特設的試驗室裏去仔細研究。經過了相當繁複的分析之後，證明那張鈔票果然是假的！</p>
<p>財政部試驗室的負責人稱，這種假鈔實在是僞造按技術最高明的一種，豈但外行人要上當，就是一部份專門負責鑒定假鈔的人也以爲是美國政府的印鈔機上出來的。這兩種假鈔（一種五十元，一種二十元）用的紙張不同，所以大家疑心這兩種鈔票來自兩種不同的來源。有一部份人猜測說，這種鏤版機器可能是從德國來的。歐洲戰事結束後，美軍曾在納粹的集中營裏發現過大批鏤版的專家，他們雖被拘禁，却頗受納粹的優待，他們主要的任務就是專門偽造英美兩國的鈔票。他們做出來的假金鎊票，居然送到英吉利銀行（英國的國家銀行）時毫未發生問題，竟沒有一個人疑心到這是假鈔票！</p>
<p>因此，有人就想，也許就是這一批版子或者假鈔票，由匪帮從德國私運出來，到了上海。另外還有一個消息，說是日本曾僞造大宗美鈔，總額達一億美元之鉅，但日本人却否認有過這樣一件事情。</p>
<p>據那位記者說：上海的美軍當局正在全力追究道一批匪帮的蹤跡，可是吿密的人雖多，却誰也不能提供具體的證據。而上海的美商銀行中，這些假鈔票却仍舊在源源不絕的出現。</p>
<p>但是，我想，這些假鈔票到美商銀行去的一定祗是少數中的少數。金鈔黑市不是假鈔票最理想的「用武之地」。</p>
<h3>逐客新術</h3>
<p>— 元義</p>
<p>美國有許多生意興隆的餐館，因爲客人在進餐後往往喜歡逗留不去，以致影響營業，現在已開始採用一種新的設備；等到客人在櫃台前面的椅子上坐好，那只櫃台便和坐椅一同慢慢地向左方旋轉起來，轉了幾尺，就有一個站在活動櫃臺後面的女侍應生送上一只菜，這樣轉之不已，菜也一道道依照一定的時間送上來，你來不及吃就祗好犧牲。吃完最後一道菜時，那只櫃台和吃客的坐椅已轉到盡頭，這時候那吃客必須馬上就走，如果他再想留下談天，就必然大吃一驚——原來他坐的那只椅子轉到了這地方，牠竟自然而然的掉到地板下面去了！</p>
<h3>克服怕水心理</h3>
<p>— 毛毅</p>
<p>又是人魚的大顯身手的季節了。但是儘管海濱和游泳池中擁滿了人，他們的數目和人口總數之比依然顯得渺小。何以會有這種現象呢？美國的名游泳敎練福蘭克·達爾頓說得最有見地：「美國人之中有五分之三不會游泳…他們之中大多數不知道如何游泳，並且也不想知道—祗因爲他們怕水。</p>
<p>人們怕水而不肯學習游泳的結果，每年產生了不少溺死鬼。這些冤鬼之中大多數都不是無法自力逃生的。游泳專家們一致同意：不管一個人對水的恐懼如何的敏銳與深刻，都是有藥可治的。</p>
<p>在治療這種病態的程序中，有兩個簡單的步驟：第一，了解恐懼的原因；第二，克服它。成人的困難也許由他的個人的恐懼或者童年時代的恐懼構成的。不論是那一種情形，他必須先找出使他把水當作仇敵的某一件意外事情或者別的根田。</p>
<p>怕水的理由也許簡單得很，例如，幼時在洗澡時不愼由母親的手中滑跌到浴缸中，撞痛了，從此便不肯洗澡，更不肯游泳。</p>
<p>知道了一個人怕水的理由之後，便可以對症下藥。所以，一個游泳敎練應該懂得心理學，因爲怕水是心理的病態而不是生理的病態。「怕水病」通常並不難醫。有許多成年的「病人」雖然早已忘了引起他們對水發生恐懼的原因，但是，由於濟意識的作祟，始終不敢與水接近。對於這種「病人」，敎練或醫生要「追根」的盤詰，盡力勾起他的記憶。一且追溯到原始的原因，他常會恍然一笑，笑自己過去胆怯得幼稚，就此不怕水了。</p>
<p>當然，「怕水病」和其他的心理病態一樣是需要視個別的症狀加以個別的治療，而不能像治白喉一樣一槪注射血淸。</p>
<p>解釋和誘導是醫治「怕水病」的兩大靈藥。常伴一個不願或不肯游泳的人到游泳的地方去參觀，同時在語言和行動方面加以挑動與慫恿—但是不可强迫—不久他便會躍躍欲試而自動下水了。</p>
<h3>樂陵小棗</h3>
<p>— 竹影</p>
<p>樂陵棗爲山東特產之一，久負盛名，色絳紅，其大如櫻桃，故呼之爲樂陵小棗，味甘醇，核小而軟，旅行該地者，莫不以先嘗爲快。</p>
<p>出樹於夏歷四月始花，花黃而微小，馨香如玫瑰，花時蜜蜂羣集樹上，終夜不去。葉作卵形，互生，似槐，但稍小耳。</p>
<p>花生葉下，每隔一葉，即生一花，結實甚旺，樹高丈許，枝幹槎　，木質堅重，多用以刻書版，或造車軸，爲用甚廣。</p>
<p>樂陵之東北鄕一帶，棗林甚茂，農人視爲奇貨，蓋一年之生活，胥賴此棗林之收穫耳。</p>
<p>樹在十年前後，結實最多而最旺，味亦最甘甜，過時則漸次退减，樹亦漸次乾枯，木質亦不如前之堅美，其後亦不再結實矣。</p>
<p>五六月間，　的成實，俗謂五月端午，小棗塞鼻子，此言其棗之大小，惟色靑綠，食之無味，白露節後，一變而爲紅色，俗所謂白露無靑棗也，滿樹點點如櫻珠。下棗時，先以蘆蓆舖地，以防泥汚，然後再以竹竿往樹上打去，萬竿交下，如落驟雨，未幾，地上可厚尺餘。惟棗落地受傷，最易腐敗，故僅當地之人，或附近之人得嘗此鮮炎，行銷外埠者，多係乾炎也。</p>
<p>蝟善倫棗，猱升樹端，以爪摘棗落地，然後下樹，將　聚一處，翻身一滾，炎扎刺上，馱之歸窠，以備冬日之需云。農人多在樹下束草爲人，披簑戴笠，手持弓箭，作守護狀。蝟疑爲人，則不敢再進。</p>
<h3>小雨點</h3>
<p>— 施濟美</p>
<p>人心是一件奇異的東西，在那一方寸的地方，藏有許多的珍寳和垃級，盛開的花，和無根的草，神仙的宮殿，以及魔鬼的領地……</p>
<p>被人關心和關心別人都是美事，但是前者是快樂的享受，後者是痛苦的享受。</p>
<p>有理由的恨，比無名的愛更有價値。</p>
<p>成功的人不一定偉大，偉大的人也不一定成功。——這是極簡單的一回事，可憐一班庸俗之徒竟永遠弄不懂，</p>
<p>打了折扣的眼睛老將鍍金當作眞金。</p>
<p>山野的松樹是常靑的，但是人們折下牠的枝梢，栽在紫沙小盆裏，像盆景一樣的欣賞，像暖房裏花朶一樣培養的時候，反而憔悴了、</p>
<p>有善心而無善行，如同燈盞裏有油，但不將它點亮。</p>
<h3>保民</h3>
<p>— 公孫午</p>
<p>朱嘉編所孟子要略，已亡佚，淸末劉傳榮始於金仁山孟子集汪老證內搜出，謂得復此書之舊。曾國藩爲之叙，謂劉君僅能排比次第，抑猶未完之書云。余素不喜要略，精華等書，以爲是特個人研究之具，若爲便檢閱計，不如編一索引為愈。孟軻論仁政，主在制民之產，所稱百畝之田，五畝之宅，其書五見，蓋民事莫先於此，蠶桑鷄豚之業，即王道之始也。恒心恒產之義，曾兩言之，是即孟子政論基礎。其行事則均井田，正經界，薄稅歛，平穀祿，省刑罰，敎孝弟，是其目也。然孟子未能言民治·民主，雖有民貴君輕之論，知尊軍民意矣，實不出民爲邦本舊說，其言制民之產，亦不過爲得民者言耳。二千年後有黃宗義，作原君，亦未料後世有民治之制。民有·民享之義，孟子言之特詳，若摘取七篇中論得民諸條，排比成籍，雖割裂故書，亦甚便初學，保民而王之說，一覽可盡矣。</p>

<h3>National Army Launches General Offensive on Nanzhang in Northern Hubei</h3>
<p>[Our Hankou Dispatch, 1st] Military news: A main force of Liu's bandits, numbering approximately ten thousand, who had been entrenched in the outskirts of Xiangyang, are currently causing disturbances in the Nanzhang area. After sweeping away the remaining bandits, the National Army is launching a general offensive on Nanzhang with fierce firepower. Regarding the rumors of fierce fighting in the suburbs of Xiangyang, military authorities here have not yet confirmed them, stating that the National Army's strategy is to annihilate the main force of the bandit army, and they do not place excessive importance on the gain or loss of a particular city or town. Therefore, under the current circumstances, even if there are few bandit troops in the Xiangyang urban area, there is no need for an active offensive.</p>
<p>[Our Chongqing Dispatch, 1st] A portion of Yang Gancai's army group recently advanced from Beiziling and Shiqiaoyi north of Jingmen towards Nanzhang, and has reached Wuan Yan. The 14th and 15th Brigades of Kong's bandits are fleeing north from Nanzhang, while the 16th Brigade, stationed in Laokou and Gucheng, has retreated to the bandit nest in Youxian. The 45th Brigade is causing disturbances along the highway west of Baihe, south of the Shaanxi-Hubei border, in Kashi Street, Maoping, and Damao, attempting to bypass into Sichuan. Fang Qing's National Army is currently deploying from Pingli in southern Shaanxi and Zhenping on the Shaanxi-Sichuan border towards western Hubei. It is confirmed that the vanguard troops have reached Zhuxi.</p>
<p>[Our Chongqing Dispatch, 1st] Zheng Huaiyuan's bandit group of over a thousand, entrenched in Hougang, has recently fled to Haozikou.</p>
<h3>Decisive Victory Achieved in Central Shanxi; Yuci and Jinyuan Both Recaptured; Stillness in Eastern Hebei as National Army Deployment Completed</h3>
<p>[Our Xi'an Dispatch, 1st] The Communist bandits' dream of invading Taiyuan has been shattered by the National Army. The Communist troops suffered heavy casualties, and the National Army has achieved a decisive victory on the west bank of the Fen River.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Xi'an, 1st] The National Army in Taiyuan has now begun to counterattack the invading bandits. On July 31st, Yuci and Jinyuan counties were recaptured. After clearing out the scattered bandits along the Tongpu and Zhengtai lines, our elite troops advancing south immediately pointed towards Yuci. The bandits were unable to reinforce, and our army immediately entered the county seat. On the same day, the bandits in Jinyuan also retreated south towards Qingyuan in a panic, as our army crossed Xiaodian Town and the Jinyuan salient, exposing their positions.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Taiyuan, 1st] The National Army's sweep of the outer perimeter of Bingzhou has made significant progress. After driving back the bandits on the west bank of the Fen River on the morning of the 31st, a certain unit of the National Army recaptured Yijing at 1:00 p.m. The remaining bandits fled south in a panic. The National Army advancing south also cleared out the bandit troops in Lijiazhuang and other villages east of Jinyuan City and recovered Gongjiabao south of Xiaodian Town at 11:00 a.m. on the 31st.</p>

<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 1st] President Chiang and his wife officially dedicated the newly renovated Presidential Residence on Xiaohongshan in the suburbs of Nanjing as a worship hall to God at 11:00 a.m. on the 1st.

<h3>Foreign Ships Arriving in Xiamen from the Philippines Carry 3 Trillion in Overseas Remittances</h3>
<p>Over 2 Trillion Still Enters the Black Market</p>
<p>[Our Xiamen Dispatch, 1st] The Zhibade ship arrived in Xiamen from the Philippines yesterday.

About 500 billion was remitted through the Bank of China, 100 billion through the National Bank, and the remaining 2 trillion flowed into the black market. Although the Central Bank has preferential measures for overseas remittances, the official rate combined with the exchange rate is still lower than the black market rate. Judging from this, the effect is minimal.

<p>[Our Shenyang Dispatch, 1st] The Northeast People's "July 5th" Support Association originally scheduled a mass meeting of citizens for the 1st. However, as the central government has attached great importance to the "July 5th" incident, and has sent high-ranking officials to investigate, and the Commander-in-Chief of the Garrison has firmly expressed his responsibility, it was decided last night to temporarily postpone the demonstration and wait for the government to resolve the matter.

<h3>The Executive Yuan Will Not Propose Reconsideration of the Budget; Ordinary Departments Will Publish It Immediately; The Special Budget Will Remain a Closely Guarded Secret</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 1st] The National Revenue and Expenditure General Budget Bill for the second half of the 37th year of the Republic [1948], after being reviewed by the Legislative Yuan and sent to the Executive Yuan, was discussed at the Executive Yuan's extraordinary meeting on the 31st. It was unanimously deemed to be generally sound, and the Executive Yuan has replied to the Legislative Yuan that it does not intend to propose reconsideration. It is learned that the Legislative Yuan, upon receiving the reply, will promptly publish the entirety of the ordinary portion of the budget. However, the special budget will remain a closely guarded secret.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 1st] Within the general budget for the second half of the 37th year, there was an item for housing construction costs amounting to three trillion yuan. The allocation method for this sum has been drafted by the Executive Yuan and agreed upon by the secretaries-general of the other four Yuan. It has now been finalized and will soon be discussed at an Executive Yuan meeting. Key points are as follows: (1) The allocation of construction funds is limited to the dormitories of personnel of the five Yuan and their directly subordinate ministries and commissions. The construction of dormitories needed by other agencies will be planned and handled separately in the future. (2) The allocated amount will be calculated based on the proportional standard of the number of personnel in each agency who have reported that they do not yet have dormitories. (3) According to the above scope, there are more than 8,000 personnel in the five Yuan and various ministries and commissions who do not yet have dormitories, with an average allocation of more than 370 million yuan per person. (4) Strive for consistency in construction methods and standards. As this method has not yet been approved by the Executive Yuan, the construction of dormitories for personnel of various agencies still remains to be seen. However, the construction costs for Legislative Yuan dormitories, totaling 1.8 trillion yuan, have already been approved by the Executive Yuan. This amount is nearly two-thirds of the total construction costs for dormitories for personnel of the five Yuan, while the dormitory construction costs for Legislative Yuan personnel are still covered within the 3 trillion yuan.</p>
<h3>Estimated Budget of State-Owned Enterprises; Review Procedure Discussed by the Legislative Yuan Budget Committee</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 1st] The Budget Committee of the Legislative Yuan is scheduled to hold a full committee meeting at 9:00 AM on the 2nd to discuss the review of the estimated operating budgets of various state-owned enterprises. This part of the estimates was discussed during the Legislative Yuan's review of the national general budget. It was considered to lack detail. Committee members generally advocated that state-owned enterprises should reduce staff and expenditures, and that the profit figures should be increased. Therefore, it was retained and the Executive Yuan was requested to supplement the relevant data on the operating revenue and expenditure of each institution for reference. Now that the Executive Yuan's documents have arrived, the Budget Committee will begin to re-examine them. The meeting on the 2nd will first decide the review procedure and the candidates for the initial review committee. The meeting place will be the Chairman's Reception Room of the National Assembly Hall. A reporter visited various locations on the upper floor of the National Assembly Hall on the 1st. Except for the six meeting rooms downstairs, which are closed when not needed, the large lounge upstairs and the small conference rooms on both corridors remain as usual. The tables and chairs have not been moved. It seems that holding three or five small meetings at the same time will not be a problem.</p>

<h3>Editorial: How to Attract Foreign Exchange Funds</h3>
<p>Although the "Measures for Overseas Chinese Capital and Funds of Nationals Abroad to Apply for Investment in Domestic Production Enterprises" have been promulgated by the Executive Yuan, the implementing rules are still under review by the authorities. Therefore, in fact, this new measure to attract foreign exchange funds has not yet been implemented. This newspaper has previously made suggestions on improving overseas remittances. Therefore, regarding this new measure, how to attract foreign exchange funds, we would like to further offer some opinions for the reference of the relevant authorities.</p>
<p>First, we must point out that those who possess foreign exchange are one group of people, while those who are willing to start businesses are another group. Capitalists and entrepreneurs, in fact, often cannot be lumped together. Just look at those customers in the stock exchange, flipping long and short, changing in an instant, and you can see a glimpse of the psychology of the wealthy. Moreover, much of the overseas Chinese capital is earned through hard work, and is remitted in small amounts to support families in their home country. How many of them have the desire and ability to return to China to start businesses? Now, Articles 8, 9, and 10 of the Measures stipulate that the return of overseas Chinese capital must be premised on establishing or expanding businesses, and that the goods brought back to China, except for a portion that may be resold, and the proceeds from the sale must be deposited in designated banks and used in accordance with the approved production plan. So, how can that overseas Chinese capital be smoothly guided back to China? The most difficult thing to understand is that the identity of the owner of the overseas Chinese capital must be certified in writing by the local embassy or consulate and must be reviewed and approved by the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission before being allowed to proceed according to the above articles. Is the government afraid that someone will impersonate overseas Chinese to remit money back to China?</p>
<p>Second, we believe that the new measures impose too strict restrictions on applications for the import of funds from nationals abroad, which may not be enough to attract foreign exchange funds. For example:</p>
<p>(1) It must be certified by the local bank where the deposit is made that it was deposited before June 30, 1948. If the local bank refuses to certify, why not allow it to be invested back in China? Is it afraid that there are other entanglements that will involve the government? Isn't the whole country now shouting about borrowing or requisitioning these funds? These funds have not yet flowed back, and the government has already attached conditions, clearly indicating restrictions. What exactly is the intention? Or is it afraid that too much will flow back? Also, why must deposits after June 30, 1948 be prohibited from returning? Is it afraid that someone will engage in currency arbitrage, or secretly evade funds abroad first, and then invest them back through this channel? We believe that the evasion of funds should be prevented. If pre-emptive prevention fails, and the funds can automatically flow back into the country legally afterward, it seems that they should be welcomed. Why is it necessary to prohibit them again?</p>
<p>(2) The production equipment that must be imported must be for the applicant's own use, and the raw materials that the business must import must be for the applicant's own use, not exceeding six months of production needs. These regulations are intended to strictly limit the overseas funds of nationals, allowing them to only be used for their own purposes when applying to bring goods back to China, not allowing them to be transferred to others, and limiting the quantity, not allowing them to be arbitrarily increased. The intent of the latter restriction is to crack down on hoarding, whether this is necessary is not discussed for the time being. What needs to be discussed is, as mentioned above, that wealthy people may not necessarily be involved in production, especially in running factories, and those who can run production and factories may not necessarily have funds deposited abroad. Why limit them to self-ownership and self-use, and not allow them to borrow freely? If they are allowed to borrow freely, what harm will it cause to the country? What harm will it cause to both parties? Currently, most factories in China, except for a very few that are solely owned, are started as joint ventures or are funded on an ad hoc basis. For what reason is this common practice not applicable to this type of fund and the factories they run? Isn't it being touted that foreign investment is welcome to come to China to start industries? For this type of foreign investment, whether it is sole proprietorship, joint venture, self-owned, or other-owned, it seems that there are no strict restrictions. The Import Management Committee has clearly stated that it will consider it separately. Why must it be stipulated that funds from nationals abroad must be used by themselves and absolutely not allowed to be transferred?</p>
<p>(3) The applicant shall report the progress of the project and the use and storage of imported equipment, materials, and raw materials in writing on a monthly basis, and may send personnel to inspect it when necessary. This clause is a solemn inspection to prevent private resale, which seems to be beyond reproach. However, other equipment, materials, and raw materials imported with foreign exchange do not seem to have this type of condition. Why is it necessary to take special precautions against those imported with funds from nationals abroad? Does this batch of imported goods contain unexpected dangers? Or is it ostensibly welcoming and attracting, but in reality still wary of too much import?</p>
<p>(4) If there is any resale for profit, the applicant and the import merchant acting as agent shall be subject to the penalty of permanent suspension of raw material quota allocation and permanent prohibition from applying to import any goods. This is also a common article in trade control. However, this penalty should apply equally to all other foreign orders to be fair. If imported goods ordered with other foreign exchange, or even imported goods obtained from quota allocation, can be openly resold for profit, and the applicant and the import merchant are not responsible in any way, but the items imported with self-owned overseas funds are subject to such strict restrictions, this is inevitably partial, and there is nothing to commend.</p>
<p>In short, in this autumn of extremely depleted foreign exchange funds, for all overseas Chinese capital and funds of nationals abroad, in principle, it seems that they are welcome to come, and should not be completely rejected. Bringing goods back to the country, starting factories on their own, using them for their own purposes, or transferring them, as long as they apply according to the law and obtain permission, it seems that they can all be accommodated, without setting up too many restrictions. The current measures have too many obstacles, equivalent to deeply closing the door, making it impossible for them to flow in, so that these funds flow into the black market or escape to Hong Kong. This time, in desperation, a new chapter has been established, originally to attract foreign exchange funds that are self-supplied. Why be so rigidly bound to the point of investing in factories, still blocking them outside the door, making it a phenomenon that can be hoped for but not obtained? Some people think that Chinese laws do not need to be seen as rigid, as long as there is a line of road that can be connected, merchants will not worry about having the skill of grafting one thing onto another for coordination. We have seen the prosperity of smuggling and the rampant black market for foreign exchange in recent years. This speculation may indeed be a way of natural adjustment in the future. However, who is doing it, and who is making it happen? Knowing that law enforcement is difficult, but striving for strict legislation, one cannot help but sigh in regret.</p>

<h3>Taiwan to Issue Water Conservancy Bonds; Total Amount 13.9 Billion Yuan</h3>
<p>[Our Taipei Dispatch, 1st] Taiwan Province is preparing to issue water conservancy bonds totaling 13.9 billion NT dollars. This amount is needed for the water conservancy budget for this year, but the provincial government's total budget is only 14.2 billion yuan, resulting in an approved water conservancy budget of only 180 million yuan, which cannot be sustained. Therefore, the decision to issue bonds has been made, and the Water Conservancy Bureau has carefully drafted a plan. According to Director Zhang Xishou, these bonds will not be offered for public sale, but will be allocated at a price to individuals who directly benefit from water conservancy.</p>

<h3>Central Government Values Yellow River Dikes; Dong Biwu's Absurd Remarks Intend to Shift Blame; Spokesperson of the Ministry of Water Resources Refutes Specifically</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 1st] The communist bandit Dong Biwu recently, under the guise of his so-called "Chairman of the China Liberated Areas Relief General Association," broadcast absurd remarks to Mr. Hoskins, President of the World Friends Service Committee China Service, and Mr. Leonard, the American Red Cross Representative in China, falsely accusing the central government of obstructing the Yellow River flood control project, resulting in the imminent breach of the south bank of the Yellow River. This is a fabrication of facts, a reversal of right and wrong, and a confusion of public opinion. The spokesperson of the Ministry of Water Resources specifically refutes this as follows: The dikes of the lower Yellow River are related to the safety of Henan, Hebei, Shandong, Jiangsu, and Anhui provinces. The central government has always attached great importance to them. At the beginning of the victory of the War of Resistance, the Yellow River closure and dike restoration project was listed as the primary task of post-war reconstruction and actively promoted. Despite the communist bandits' repeated obstruction and sabotage, the closure project was finally completed in March 1947. However, the dike restoration part could not be carried out in coordination with the closure project due to the communist bandits' obstruction. At that time, the river returned to its old course, and the flood season was imminent. The situation was urgent, the work was difficult, and the crisis was hidden. The central government immediately intensified construction on the sections of the dike controlled by the national army, including the areas in Henan and Hebei provinces, the southwest bank of Shandong, and the sections on both banks between Qihe and Jiyang near Jinan in central Shandong. In June of last year, through liaison and mediation, a mixed committee was organized by the central government, the communist bandits, and the United Relief Agency to discuss how to prevent military operations from affecting the dike restoration and repair project. While the meeting was in progress, Liu Bocheng's troops suddenly crossed the river in large numbers from Dongkou on June 30th, roaming around, capturing, and killing our dike repair workers, forcing the dike repair work in southern Hebei and western Shandong to come to a standstill. The mixed committee also came to an end because the communist bandits had no sincerity in negotiating. Later, when Liu's main force fled south to the Dabie Mountain area, the order along the river was roughly restored, and our workers were able to return to work and continue to engage in repair and defense. Fortunately, it was safe during the flood season. In December, the communist bandits occupied Dongming and Lanfeng, and all the dike sections on the southwest bank of Shandong were abandoned. Since the communist bandits occupied this section of the river dike, they not only did not repair or protect the dikes but also engaged in planned destruction. From Tongwaxiang to Linpuji, the top of the dike was generally excavated into southern trenches several feet wide and several feet deep. The materials, grain, and housing along the dike were also mostly destroyed. In May of this year, the national army in southern Hebei and western Shandong advanced, and our dike repair workers had just returned to the defense with the army to start work, but Chen Yi's troops of the communist bandits crossed the river south from Dongkou again on June 2nd. Our workers had no choice but to leave a part of the flood team technicians disguised as guards, and the rest retreated with the army again. In late June, Kaifeng was once again captured. The communist bandits burned the entire Yellow River Conservancy Engineering Bureau to the ground. All kinds of instruments, materials, furniture, and automobiles were burned or looted, and none were spared. The Henan and Hebei repair offices also suffered heavy losses. The equipment of the various work sections and brick factories below Kaifeng in Henan Province was looted. The new work that was not completed this spring was also destroyed. Their hostility to the dikes and the people along the river is obvious. Recently, the Gao Village in Dongming, Hebei Province, encountered danger, and the situation was critical. Since the area has been occupied by bandits, only a few workers have been disguised as guards. They used the existing bricks to repair the breach, but the top of the breach was heavily impacted by the rapid current, and the situation is still extremely dangerous. The Yellow River Conservancy Engineering Bureau has instructed the Hebei Repair Office to send personnel to repair the breach with the army. This matter is the duty of the government and is related to the safety of the local people. We have always tried our best to do it. Although we have been repeatedly disturbed by bandits, our workers still risk their lives, do not fear difficulties, and work desperately. A total of 33 people were captured by communist bandits in 1946, 5 were killed, and 23 were missing. In 1947, 13 people were captured by communist bandits, 41 were killed, 44 were missing, and 4 were injured. This year, 1 person was captured, 6 were killed, 163 were missing, and 2 were injured. However, the bandit Dong falsely accused the central government of obstructing the flood control project from Dongming to Juancheng in the border area between Hebei and Shandong provinces on the south bank of the Yellow River and near Jinan, saying that it was on the verge of breaching. This is a reversal of black and white and not worth refuting. However, what should be brought to the attention of Chinese and foreign people is that the communist bandits first obstructed the closure of the breach in various ways, and now they deliberately destroy the dike restoration. On June 30th last year, Liu's crossing of the river, and Chen's crossing of the river on June 2nd this year, the first to be disturbed were the river workers. Who is the culprit is obvious to all. Now, taking advantage of the arrival of the flood season, they suddenly shoot arrows without a target and counterattack the central government. Looking at their intentions, it is clear that they have a conspiracy to create an artificial breach, prevaricate and shift the blame to the central government. Their sinister tricks are to cover up the truth. We sincerely hope that Chinese and foreign people will not be misled by these chaotic remarks of the communist bandits, and we hope that the communist bandits will arouse their conscience and prioritize the lives and property of the people, abandon this poisonous plan, and withdraw from the area occupied on the south bank of the Yellow River, so that our local government and water conservancy agencies can carry out the repair and defense work with a free hand. We are confident that we can prevent floods. Otherwise, once the flood arrives, if a breach occurs, all responsibility should be borne entirely by the communist bandits.</p>

<h3>Molotov Shortens Vacation; Meets Separately with Three Special Envoys; Contact Begins to Resolve East-West Disputes</h3>
<p>[This newspaper dispatch] London, 1st Broadcast: After the envoys of the United States, Britain, and France unexpectedly met with Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov on the evening of the 31st, they met at Smith's residence today in high spirits and exchanged views on everyone's impressions of meeting Molotov. The three envoys briefly presented the proposals of the United States, Britain, and France to resolve East-West disputes to Mr. Molotov. It is expected that there will be no new developments in the consultations between the Western countries and the Soviet Union on the issues of Germany and Berlin before the beginning of next week. The Soviet Union will carefully consider the replies of the envoys of the United States, Britain, and France.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Moscow, 31st United Press] Molotov shortened his vacation today, returned to the Foreign Ministry from his summer villa outside Moscow, and held consultations with the representatives of the United States, Britain, and France on the crisis between the East and West in Germany. Mr. Molotov successively met with the American Ambassador Smith, the British Foreign Secretary Bevin's private secretary Roberts, and the French Ambassador Chatenet, and talked with each person for about 30 minutes. Each person informed the Soviet Foreign Minister of their government's attitude towards the Soviet Union's blockade of Berlin and reviewed the entire German situation. Prior to this, the representatives of the three countries met with Foreign Deputy Zorin, who represented Molotov, last night and expressed their desire to fully discuss the Berlin issue with the highest Soviet officials. Zorin conveyed this intention to Molotov, who decided to personally meet with the representatives of the three countries.</p>
<p>[United Press, London, 1st] Well-informed political figures said on the 1st that the showdown between the East and West blocs over the Berlin blockade does not necessarily lead to a new world war, but the Allies must prepare for war to back up their diplomatic offensive against the Soviet Union and prevent the Soviet Union from dominating Germany alone. It is reported that many influential officials in the United States are absolutely pessimistic, believing that discussing the resolution of the German issue with the Soviet Union is like seeking skin from a tiger. They believe that if the Western countries do not have a showdown, they will not be able to break the German deadlock. It is also reported that many experts say that although the showdown will not happen immediately, it will eventually be realized one day. They are pessimistic about the entire German situation, especially the "new strategy" of negotiating with the Kremlin. They believe that the Soviet Union's conditions are too harsh, and it is impossible to reach an "agreement" by talking with the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>At the same time, news from Moscow said that the American and French ambassadors, the British special envoy, and the diplomatic cadres of the three countries are discussing the next step on the Berlin issue. Officials said that all news about the progress of the negotiations should be issued from the capitals of the three countries. Americans in London believe that the East-West agreement on Germany is hopeless and point out that the control of Germany is in a desperate situation. Other countries in Europe have all chosen the good and followed. The Soviet Union completely controls East Germany. If the Soviet Union agrees with the West, it should slightly relax its dominance in its occupied area. The Western Allies completely control West Germany and are currently planning to establish a West German government in Frankfurt to link it with the Marshall Plan and the Western European Union. Agreeing with the Soviet Union is tantamount to abandoning West Germany, making it threatened by Soviet occupation.</p>
<h3>Berlin Situation Shows No Improvement; US Reaffirms Decision to Remain; People Mourn American Airlift Personnel Who Died</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Berlin, 31st] General Clay, Commander of the US Forces in Germany, declared at a press conference today: Since the Warsaw Conference, the Soviet Union's attitude towards the German issue has not changed. The situation in Berlin has neither improved nor deteriorated, and the opportunity for a peaceful resolution remains the same as before. "We have decided to remain in Berlin, but we hope that the problem can be resolved peacefully." Clay stressed that the Berlin airlift must continue to be maintained and even strengthened if necessary. Referring to the crisis of the Berlin municipal government, Clay said: He is not dissatisfied with the current Berlin municipal government. The municipal government may tend to split only under Soviet pressure.

<h3>Guarantee World Peace; US Has Determination; Truman Broadcast Address</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, New York, 31st] President Truman, speaking to the nation today on the completion of the new international airport in New York, said that the performance of the US Air Force today is sufficient to prove the determination of the United States to maintain a strong military force in order to protect the peace of the land. He reviewed the Air Force, and a battery fired 21 guns in salute. Mr. Truman said that the new airport is a sign that the American people have confidence in lasting peace, and therefore the construction of this airport assumes that air travel and commerce can develop in large quantities and gradually increase in importance. However, world peace cannot be easily obtained. The American people must work hard to complete the necessary conditions for peace, namely confidence, mutual trust, and understanding. Among them, confidence is the most important. Before the emergence of a world of freedom for all, there must be confidence. As for mutual trust and understanding, the United States is willing to fully exchange information with its friendly countries and hopes that there can be the highest degree of freedom in international travel and transportation. The United States will firmly support the United Nations and try to restore the world's confidence.</p>

<h3>Former White House Advisor and Former Finance Minister; Involved in US Spy Network; Spy Miss 指指 Provides Information to Soviet Union</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 31st] Miss Bentley, who claimed to have been a communist spy, testified on the 31st that the former White House advisor and the former finance minister were two of the many government officials who leaked secret information to the Soviet Union. Miss Ban voluntarily abandoned her spy work in 1945 and surrendered herself to the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and made a public statement to the House of Representatives Non-American Activities Committee on the 31st.</p>
<p>Miss Ban admitted that Corey, a former advisor to the late President Roosevelt and the current President Truman, leaked information to Miss Ban through an intermediary that the United States had "translated" the Soviet code in 1944. This made the Soviet Union "very excited." Corey was also once the late President Roosevelt's personal representative to China. Miss Ban also admitted that former Finance Minister Whit, another official who provided information, delivered the information to the Soviet Union through Miss Ban. Miss Bentley did not immediately explain what information Mr. Whit provided. Mr. Whit joined the Treasury Department in September 1934 and was promoted to Finance Minister in 1945. He had served as an official in the International Monetary Fund. In addition to admitting that Mr. Corey leaked the translation of the Soviet code, Mr. Corey also reported the "internal disputes" of the Chinese situation at that time. Miss Ban emphasized that Kerry was not a Communist, but he did provide information. Mr. Corey's information was usually given to railway worker Schaufman, who passed it on to War Economics Bureau official Schauf Master, who then passed it on to Miss Ban. Regarding Mr. Whit, Miss Ban admitted that she did not know whether he was also a Communist. Miss Ban also admitted the names of the large and small officials in the government who provided information. When asked whether these officials knew the meaning of providing information, Miss Ban replied that she could guarantee "Corey must know where the information was going."</p>
<p>Corey Denies Giving Passwords</p>
<p>[United Press, New York, 31st] Corey, the former administrative advisor to the late President Roosevelt and the current President Truman, said on the 31st that he had never known the name of Miss Bentley. Corey issued a statement saying: "To the best of my knowledge, I have never had any direct or indirect contact with a communist or a communist agent. I have never met Miss Bentley, nor do I know her name. My personal work has never involved military codes, so I could never have provided any information about the code to anyone."</p>
<p>[United Press, New York, 31st] Kerry, who served as the administrative advisor to the late President Roosevelt and the current President Truman, visited China as President Roosevelt's personal representative and returned to the White House in January 1945 to serve as the President's administrative advisor. Mr. Corey also led an economic delegation to Switzerland to persuade Switzerland to stop most of its wartime trade with Germany.</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 31st] Congressman Ruskin, a member of the Non-American Activities Committee of the House of Representatives, said on the 31st that he was dissatisfied that the committee spent so much time discussing the "humiliation of Corey." Mr. Ruskin said: He did not know why the committee could believe the third-rate information of a former Communist like Bentley. He thought what Ban Tela said might be a lie, but Ban Tela said: Whether what she said is true or not can be decided by the committee.</p>
<p>Whit Doesn't Know Spy Miss</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 31st] Former Treasury Undersecretary Whit denied on the 31st that he had provided confidential government information to anyone who might provide it to Moscow. Mr. Whit called from New York and said: He had never heard of the name Miss Bentley, and he asked the House of Representatives Non-American Activities Committee to allow him to testify in order to "refute this涨涨."</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 31st] House of Representatives Non-American Activities Committee Chairman Ferguson said on the 31st that the committee would allow Remington, an economic expert from the Department of Commerce, to meet with Ms. Bentley to confront her in person. Remington was also one of the officials accused by Miss Ban of providing her with information. Remington said: He provided news to Bentley because he recognized her as a journalist, and the news "can be provided to researchers who know how to use newspapers well."</p>
<h3>Rumor North Korea Arrests Anti-Communists</h3>
<p>[New Asia News Agency, Seoul, 1st] It was recently learned that the US military authorities stationed in South Korea declared: "The North Korean authorities recently arrested a large number of anti-communists and believers in democracy, numbering as many as 50,000 people, most of whom were sent to Sakhalin Island, and the Soviet military authorities advertised that the treatment of these "people who should be influenced" would definitely not be bad".</p>
<h3>Preparations for the Danube River Convention; Austria is Excluded from Participating; France Demands to Maintain Freedom of Navigation; Intense Debate with Soviet Representative</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Belgrade, 31st United Press] The Soviet bloc countries today unanimously rejected Austria's participation in the preparation of the new Danube River Convention. The Danube River Conference today passed (with the United Kingdom, the United States, and France abstaining) Vishinsky's motion, that Austria only has the power to request inquiries at the conference. According to prior arrangements, US Ambassador Casey suggested that the country can fully participate in the work of the conference and have the right to vote. This suggestion was rejected by seven votes to three (France abstaining).</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Belgrade, 31st] Today's Danube River Conference is characterized by the fact that the French representative demanded to maintain the rights enjoyed by France in the former Danube River Convention. The French and Soviet representatives had a fierce debate over this. This morning, the chairman of the French delegation, French Ambassador Teevenly, declared at the meeting that France cannot be bound by any new convention that disregards previous rights. Without prior agreement from all parties concerned, no majority can cancel the existing regulations. Then, Austrian representative Rosenberg stood up and stated that Austria has the full right to participate in the meeting and must not only attend as a qualified consultant. The demands of the French and Austrian representatives were supported by the delegations of the United Kingdom and the United States, but the other countries opposed them. Czech Clementis, Romanian Booker, Hungarian Molnar, and Bulgarian Kamenov all stated that France's request was tantamount to taking advantage of the rights it has obtained, intending to maintain them, and that these special rights were all obtained by imperialist powers at the expense of the legitimate interests and natural rights and sovereignty of the small countries on the Danube River. However, the Romanian Foreign Minister admitted that the French people have special interests on the Danube River and hoped that this could be understood. Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Vishinsky debated with the French representative for an hour with stern words. Mr. Vishinsky once said, "We will never accept Aimee Dayton. The door is still open for you to enter and leave. There are no Benelux countries here, only sovereign and equal countries." Mr. Vishinsky then spoke eloquently, stating that the 1921 Danube River Treaty no longer exists because it has been repeatedly changed and violated by the signatory countries. Finally, he said that the new Danube River Convention must be passed by a majority of countries and implemented according to the will of the majority of countries. The minority countries can only abide by the decisions of the majority of countries.</p>
<h3>Su Suggests Limiting Japan's War Potential</h3>
<p>Talks with Soviet Representative at the Economic and Social Council</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chenggong Lake, 31st, United Press] The Soviet representative told the United Nations Economic and Social Council today that the Soviet Union agrees to the development of Japan's peacetime industry, but Japan's war potential should be limited. It is reported that the Council is currently meeting in Geneva to discuss the work of its Asian and Far Eastern Committee. The United Nations Headquarters received a telegram from Geneva today reporting on the meeting situation.</p>
<h3>Britain closely watches the political situation in Hungary and Poland, the Hungarian President is succeeded by Szakasits, the Soviet Union intensifies its control over Eastern European satellite states</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, London, 31st] The British Foreign Office expects to receive reports from British Minister to Hungary, Helm, regarding the reasons for the resignation of Hungarian President Tildy, and from Ambassador to Poland, Gainar, regarding the current situation in Poland. The Foreign Office is particularly eager to learn about the rumors of the arrest of Polish Deputy Prime Minister Gomułka. According to sources here, this development is a sign that the Soviet Union is currently trying to eliminate politically suspicious elements in countries within its sphere of influence.</p>
<p>[United Press, Budapest, 1st] Hungarian party leaders met on the 1st and unanimously supported the chairman of the United Workers' Party, Szakasits, to succeed Tildy as president. The communique stated that the arrest warrant for Tildy's son-in-law, Sonoki, has not yet been issued, and government officials are still keeping this a secret. It is reported that Szakasits was promoted to president as a reward for his contribution to the merger of the Social Democratic Party into the Communist Party or the United Workers' Party.</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 1st] Former Hungarian Prime Minister Nagy, who has been in exile since the coup last May, declared on the 1st that the purge of non-communist leaders by Eastern European communist parties indicates that the Soviet Union is ordering its satellite states to prepare for war against the West. He also stated that President Tildy was "undoubtedly" ousted by the Communist Party, just like Beneš of Czechoslovakia. "Obviously, the Soviet Union intends to implement a new diplomatic policy, according to which important political positions in Eastern Europe should be managed by loyal communists. This new diplomatic policy is to prepare for war against democratic countries and the United States."</p>
<h3>New York International Airport Completed, US Air Force Holds Grand Performance, 850 Aircraft of Various Types Participate, Truman and Dewey Inspect in Person</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, New York, 31st] An unprecedented strategic formation of American vehicular aircraft was inspected today at the newly completed international airport in New York City by President Truman, New York Governor Dewey, and New Jersey Governor Driscoll. Today's air show was truly a spectacle of the era. 850 aircraft, from jet fighters to super bombers and troop transport aircraft, roared overhead in the most spectacular formation, revealing to the world the restored air power of the United States.</p>
<p>Today's air power, a grand performance in peacetime, was held for the official opening of New York International Airport. The new airport covers an area of ​​5,000 acres, cost $240 million, and took six years to build. From now on, it can accommodate 1,000 aircraft takeoffs and landings per day, and transport 10 million passengers per year. Today is New York City's anniversary, and the opening ceremony of this huge airport was specially held today, and the International Aviation Exhibition, which details the situation of this aviation century, also started today. The exhibition will last for nine days. The US Navy also participated in the military performance today, with hundreds of naval aircraft performing attack and defense battles, the situation is very realistic and vivid. The British Air Force and Navy also participated in the performance as separate units. In addition to Truman, Dewey, and Driscoll, there were also senior Chinese officials on the review stand. Representatives from the Soviet Union, Poland, Czechoslovakia, and Yugoslavia were neither invited nor participated, which has attracted much attention. The US official explanation for this matter is that at the recent air show held in Moscow, the Soviet government did not invite the United States to participate, so the United States did not invite the Soviet Union and its vassal states this time. Today's grand performance of American air power, on the one hand, was strengthened by Truman's participation, and on the other hand, it was held during the Berlin crisis, and countries around the world will not ignore its significance.</p>
<h3>Krupp Armaments Factory Owner Sentenced to Twelve Years in Prison</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Nuremberg, 31st] German steel magnate Krupp von Bohlen was found guilty today by the Third US Military Tribunal of harming humanity, sentenced to twelve years in prison, and all his property was confiscated. Other accomplices convicted included Losse, manager of the Essen factory, sentenced to seven years in prison, Johnson, who succeeded Losse as manager of the metal factory in 1943, sentenced to ten years in prison, steel expert Muller sentenced to twelve years in prison, Inn, assistant to Johnson and Minister of War Production Eberhardt, sentenced to nine years in prison, and secret police liaison von Blow sentenced to twenty months and nineteen days. The only person acquitted was Schech, Eberhardt's predecessor.

He also mentioned that 520 Hungarian Jews were abused, and only two survived. Qualified circles here said that the confiscation of Krupp's property included many huge armaments factories. According to reliable sources, the verdict was decided by a two-to-one vote, and Krupp's lawyers opposed the confiscation of Krupp's property.</p>
<h3>Siamese House of Representatives Schedules Discussion on Excluding Overseas Chinese Immigration Case, If the Entire Case is Passed, it Will Be Equivalent to Banning Foreigners from Entering the Country</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Bangkok, 1st] Siamese Lieutenant General Luan Jiao Song recently adopted the view of a Siamese junior officer currently in the United States, and sent letters to all members of parliament, advocating that the number of overseas Chinese entering the country each year should be reduced to 20. Luan said in the letter: A large number of foreigners have recently immigrated to Siam, and soon the Siamese people will lose all opportunities to make a living, leaving only skin and bones.</p>
<p>Luan also cited the United States as an example, saying: "When I considered this issue, I received a letter from a junior officer stationed in the United States, saying that the area of the United States is twelve times that of Siam, but the number of overseas Chinese allowed to enter the country each year is only 105. At the same time, the United States also hopes that China will support its democratic ideas. According to this ratio, Siam should set the limit to 20, and the limit for Western people should also be the same." Former Siamese Prime Minister and leader of the Democratic Party, Nai Baiyabaiheng, said: Luan compared Siam with the United States, I don't know what the intention is. It is reported that Congressman Nai Soli once suggested in the House of Representatives to limit the number of foreigners entering the country to 2,000 per year. The House of Representatives may discuss this case on the 5th, so Luan took the opportunity to put forward this proposal. Nai Soli's reason for proposing the amendment is that the Siamese people are not as diligent as foreigners, so this is used as a demonstration, but what Luan advocates is almost a ban on foreigners entering the country.</p>
<h3>Looking at British Politics</h3>
<p>— Special Correspondent of this Newspaper in London, Sabengeng</p>
<p>(1)</p>
<p>The Labour Party is now in power in Britain. The Labour Party's main policy, in terms of politics, is to recognize British-style democracy, and believes that the current parliamentary system can lead Britain into a socialist country. In terms of economy, it advocates that the state should operate various large enterprises under the principle of "compensation". Because of the former point, it has a great difference from the Soviet Communist Party, because the Soviet Communist Party or Soviet-style communism, in theory, worships the Marxist-Leninist class struggle theory, although some people believe that according to Marxism, the realization of a socialist society does not necessarily have to adopt violent revolution (such as Kautsky's statement), but this is not recognized by today's Communist Party.</p>
<p>In practice, in recent years, communists in various countries, although also advocating democracy, or claiming to be democrats, but here arises a problem of interpretation of terms. Having read Lenin's "State and Revolution", the content of the old and new constitutions of the Soviet Union and the process of their amendments, and paying attention to the actual actions of the communist parties in various countries in recent years, it can be known that the Communist Party's democracy is different from British-style democracy. Because of its economic policy, it is also different from the United States. The capitalist economic system first originated in Britain with the industrial revolution, but today, the representative of the capitalist economic system should be the United States rather than Britain. No matter what stage capitalism has developed to today, it still unconditionally worships the "private property system" and "freedom of enterprise". Anyone who unconditionally worships the "private property system" cannot, whether "compensated" or "uncompensated", be able to receive private enterprises by the state. Anyone who unconditionally worships "freedom of enterprise" cannot talk about government control over enterprises. These make Britain different from the United States, although the British Labour Party still recognizes the existence of the private property system. Naturally, in terms of economy, although the Labour Party's policy is different from that of the United States, it is also different from the Communist Party. The Communist Party's transformation of the social economy is carried out in a much more radical way than the Labour Party. The Communist Party will never be in the mood to sit in Parliament and slowly discuss which enterprises should be nationalized and which enterprises do not need to be nationalized. If they are nationalized, what is the method of reception? In this way, we can say that the Labour Party is a political party with a very strong "intermediate" nature. It advocates transforming society without resorting to violence.</p>
<p>(2)</p>
<p>The British Labour Party has been established for about fifty years. The current Labour government is based on the victory of the 1945 general election. On the surface, this is the third Labour government in Britain. The first was from 1923 to 1924, and the second was from 1929 to 1931. However, neither of these two Labour governments were able to occupy more than half of the seats in Parliament, but were established with the assistance of the Liberal Party. Therefore, it was not only "short-lived", but also could not fully adopt its own policies in fact. Since 1931, although the Labour Party has also participated in the government, it cannot be said to be in power. In the 1945 election, the Labour Party won more than half of the seats in Parliament. It is in power. A pure Labour government has a majority of seats in Parliament. It is the first time in British history. According to the Parliament Act of 1911, the British Parliament has a term of five years. Therefore, unless there are special circumstances that make the Labour government feel that it is necessary to dissolve Parliament and appeal to the voters, or there is a serious division within the Labour Party, the Labour Party will have five years to implement its policies. Counting from now, there is still more than a year.</p>
<p>What has the Labour Party done since it came to power? Perhaps it is the Labour Party's misfortune, perhaps it is the Labour Party's great fortune, that it has a chance to perform. Although the Labour government was established after the victory of the war against Germany, it encountered a serious economic panic in Britain. The reason for this panic has been latent for a long time. The war consumed Britain's national wealth, especially overseas assets, making it impossible to make up for the trade deficit caused by the import of food and raw materials. Britain is the birthplace of the industrial revolution, which has enabled Britain to take a step ahead of other countries in some respects, and has made it occupy some advantages in modern history. It is also because it is the birthplace of the industrial revolution, and the industrialization was too early, which has made it suffer a lot in some aspects today. The people's living standards have been raised too high, and it is not easy to shrink even if the country is poor today. Some transportation and production machinery are too old and outdated, and the war has caused greater consumption. Now, "reforming" requires a lot of capital, but not reforming will affect efficiency, which directly and indirectly affects production. In the past two years, the Labour government has been fighting a life-and-death battle with economic panic, apart from international issues. Since last summer, the suspension of convertibility of the pound and the reduction of food rations have really indicated that the problem has reached its peak.</p>
<p>But the Labour Party still has achievements. In addition to calling on people to tighten their belts and work hard to produce, the Labour Party has been continuously carrying out nationalization policies. The Bank of England, coal mines, electricity, important transportation, gas industry, etc. have all been nationalized. In terms of politics, the reform of the House of Lords and the proposal to abolish the plural voting system in the House of Commons are all underway. But the common people are the most realistic. Perhaps it is due to the failure of the local elections last year that the Labour Party has become wary, and it must do something realistic to win the votes in the next election. Perhaps it is due to the Labour Party's own policies. The budget bill for this year proposed by the Chancellor of the Exchequer in Parliament in April is a wonderful performance of the Labour Party's policies. It has revised the income tax system, which has benefited the middle class a lot, and it has implemented a "special donation" to reduce the concentration of wealth. The Labour Party is a moderate socialist. Any moderate socialist political party must maintain the existence of the middle class and cannot turn society into an extreme state of "either Yang or Mo". "Extremism" is contradictory to "moderation". The Labour Party probably sees this clearly. Therefore, the Labour Party's politics, while respecting the interests and opinions of the "trade unions", also protects the middle class. I don't think this should only be interpreted as striving for the next election votes, but should be regarded as a basic attitude. The current situation is also beginning to improve in terms of economy. The Marshall Plan has allowed the Labour Party to breathe a sigh of relief, and Britain's production has also made progress. There was still a coal shortage last spring. This spring, not only is there no coal shortage, but it has also begun to be exported.</p>
<p>(3)</p>
<p>But will the Labour Party's administration in Britain be smooth sailing? But it is not.</p>
<p>First, as mentioned above, the Labour Party is a political party with a very strong intermediate nature, and the middle road is the most difficult to walk. The left can criticize you for being conservative, and the right can scold you for being radical. And, no matter how you maintain the middle road, there is no "scale" to measure for you. Therefore, political parties with a strong intermediate nature are most prone to internal strife or division. As far as we know, regarding British foreign policy, whether it should cooperate with the United States, cooperate with the Soviet Union, or stand between the two major powers, the Labour Party has not seen a completely unified view internally. Also, whether the steel industry should be immediately nationalized has also caused controversy within the Labour Party. The partial reshuffle of the cabinet last October is said to be related to party issues. Recently, Italy held a general election. It is clear that the Labour Party's basic attitude is to hope that the current government will win. However, on the eve of the election, some members of Parliament belonging to the Labour Party sent a telegram to the Socialist Party, which opposed the government and cooperated with the Communist Party, wishing it final victory. This issue involved the issue of party discipline and caused a stir for several days. These kinds of things may still happen. This is not a question of whether the Labour Party itself is healthy, but it is due to the nature of the Labour Party. How to overcome this possible internal divergence of opinion is a problem.</p>
<p>Second, in order to realize its主張, and to win the voters in the next election, the Labour Party will naturally engage in some reforms. Every reform may encounter resistance, and this resistance may be getting bigger and bigger. According to rumors, the nationalization of the steel industry should have started long ago, but because it directly infringes on the interests of powerful people, the Labour Party cannot help but hesitate. Also, the proposed public medical system, which seems to us to be very good, has encountered resistance from doctors. The recent new budget has also been greatly criticized by conservatives. Undoubtedly, there is still a lot of resistance that the Labour Party's policies may encounter. Although Britain's social structure is different from that of the United States, it is still an old-fashioned capitalist country. These forces resisting reform must be carefully considered.</p>
<p>Third, as mentioned above, Britain is currently experiencing an economic panic. This panic makes it difficult for the government to show results to the people in order to win votes. And because of the panic, it cannot help but rely on US economic assistance. In this way, in foreign or domestic affairs, it may be directly or indirectly affected by the United States. Whether the British Labour Party admits it or not, this influence is likely to hinder or delay British reform, and it is not easy to avoid from the perspective of outsiders.</p>
<p>Due to the above, we cannot but think that there are some difficulties in the future of the Labour Party. Of course, on the other hand, there are also some things to be optimistic about. The British industrial revolution and the establishment of democratic politics have both gone through a process of gradual evolution without bloodshed. Everything in Britain seems to be developing, growing, rather than being manufactured. It can peacefully complete the establishment of a democratic system, and it can naturally peacefully establish a socialist society. The success or failure of this experiment is directly related to the welfare of the British people, and indirectly affects the whole world. Judging from the current situation, although success or failure is unknown, even if the Conservative Party comes to power again, it may not be able to turn Britain into what it was before. Is it possible to change the nationalized industry back to private ownership? The political future of Britain is still optimistic, assuming that the Labour Party can insist on implementing its policies. (July 2)</p>

<h3>Public Utilities Make Astonishing Demands, Requesting Price Increases of Four to Six Times, Public Utilities Bureau is Negotiating Loans to Reduce Costs, Eight New Prices Expected to be Announced Tomorrow</h3>
<p>The various public utility companies in this city submitted the percentage of price increases they requested for this month to the Public Utilities Bureau the night before last (May 31). According to Zhao Zengjue, Director of the Public Utilities Bureau, who told reporters: This time, the various companies requested extremely high prices because they suffered too much losses last month, and the exchange settlement certificate rose again to 4.55 million yuan last week. The telephone increase is six times, the electricity increase is four times, the water increase is five times, the gas increase is four and a half times, and the transportation increase is four times. They also stated that the price adjustment should be calculated according to the formula and should not be forcibly suppressed. The old and new dividends of the company can be ignored, but the cash income and expenditure must be balanced. The Bureau believes that the company's request is too high and the general public cannot afford it. It will do its best to negotiate loans with the Central Bank to ensure that fuel can be settled in foreign exchange as soon as possible at the beginning of the month, so that oil prices can be stabilized, which can reduce costs. According to Zhao, the new prices of the eight major public utilities, including water, electricity, gas, telephone, buses, trams, ferries, and small trains, for this month, will be announced tomorrow (3rd) as much as possible, and they will be allowed to collect retroactively from the 1st.</p>
<p>Also, regarding the number of public utility loans, the Public Utilities Bureau will negotiate with the Central Bank again today, and it is expected to be resolved.</p>
<h3>National Electrical Industry Association Sends Representatives to Petition in Beijing</h3>

In the past, barter trade with Japan by government agencies was handled by the Central Trust Bureau. However, the Executive Yuan has recently passed that government agencies can handle barter trade with Japan separately and directly in accordance with statutory procedures in the future. In addition, it is stipulated that if the Central Trust Bureau accepts entrustment from government agencies, it should fully comply with the plans set by the entrusting agency and will not charge fees. As for the number of private merchants going to Japan, it has recently increased to 60 to 100 every three months. The types of goods exported in the trade plan with Japan have also added a category of "unlimited quantity", allowing large-scale exports. These categories are all local products, in order to promote exports and enrich foreign exchange income.</p>

<h3>Business and Industry Express Concern About the August First-Period Index</h3>
<p>After the issuance of large denomination banknotes, prices were relatively stable due to the proper handling by the Central Bank and relevant authorities, allowing July to pass peacefully. However, the general business and industrial community believes that there is little reason for optimism regarding the various factors in August. They generally believe that the increase in the price of rationed rice and the price increases in public utilities and transportation are likely to drive up prices. The cost of rationed rice and public utilities both affect the cost-of-living index for the first half of the month, which will increase the burden on factories and shops. When the time comes to pay wages, it will become the biggest problem. In addition, purchasing power has generally decreased due to high prices, and sales of goods are sluggish due to inconvenient transportation in various places. Therefore, the authorities should quickly adopt effective measures to prevent price increases. Otherwise, the consequences will be unimaginable, and the important industries of Shanghai should also be quickly protected to avoid facing a severe crisis.</p>
<h3>National Goods Promotion Speech Competition Finals: Six Children in Two Groups Win Awards</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] The "National Goods Promotion Children's Speech Competition," jointly organized by the China National Products Manufacturers Association and the Shanghai Municipal School Teachers' Welfare Promotion Association, was held at the National Goods Exhibition Hall yesterday morning at 9:00 AM. Chairman Cao Zhigong delivered an opening speech, stating, "This Association and the Municipal Education Welfare Promotion Association jointly organize the National Goods Promotion Children's Speech Competition to promote national goods. Outstanding children will be given prizes by the factories of the members of this Association to encourage them, so that all children can understand national goods, promote national goods, and then love and use national goods." Li Bo then reported that the children participating in the speech competition were divided into four districts: Pudong, North, West, and Suburban. The preliminaries were held in each district, and today's event is the final competition for the champions and runners-up of each district. The speeches then began. The results were as follows: Senior Group: 1st place, He Minjuan; 2nd place, Huang Zhijun; 3rd place, Feng Bingyan. Intermediate Group: 1st place, Huang Nairen; 2nd place, Dai Ying; 3rd place, Yu Mimi. The prizes included various stationery, balls, clothing, and daily necessities donated by various manufacturers. The competition ended at 12:00 noon, and the prizes were awarded by the presidium before the meeting adjourned.</p>
<h3>Announcement of Rationed Rice Prices: Retail Market Sees New High Prices; Emergency Measures to Be Taken; Efforts to Open Supply Lines</h3>
<p>Following the announcement of this month's rationed rice prices, the market price of rice yesterday broke through new highs again. The retail market price reached as high as 50 million yuan. The municipal authorities are paying close attention to this situation. In order to curb the rising rice prices, emergency measures will be taken when the North and South markets open today. With the new grain entering the market, the rice supply being plentiful, and the continued distribution of household rice, the rise in rice prices is clearly artificial. Therefore, severe blows will be dealt to speculators and hoarders who only care about their own private interests.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the promotion of both ordinary rationed rice and subsidized rationed rice in August is being actively pursued. It is reported that the Ministry of Food has now formulated an effective plan to completely stabilize rice prices for the Shanghai food rice problem. Together with the municipal government and the Civil Regulation Committee, they will decide to use a large amount of funds in the short term to purchase large quantities of food rice from rice-producing areas abroad, such as Siam, Saigon, Brazil, etc., and from domestic rice-producing areas, such as Suzhou, Wuxi, etc., when the new grain enters the market, so that the distribution work for October, November, and December can continue to be maintained.</p>
<h3>Impoverished People Should Postpone Buying Rice Until Subsidized Certificates Are Received</h3>
<p>According to the Civil Regulation Committee, in order to avoid abuses in this distribution of subsidized rice for impoverished people, it is specifically stipulated that the subsidized rice certificate for impoverished people must be used in conjunction with the per capita ration certificate in order to be valid. As the investigation and registration of impoverished people are still under review, in order to prevent impoverished households from buying household rice beforehand, which would render the subsidized rice certificate ineffective, in addition to notifying each Baotianzhang (local official) to inform each household, it is hoped that citizens will pay attention. All households listed in the register of impoverished households should postpone purchasing per capita rationed rice. Their per capita ration certificate must be used in conjunction with the subsidized rice certificate for impoverished people after it is issued, so as not to render the subsidized rice certificate ineffective.</p>
<h3>Counterfeit Currency Operation Cracked Down in Haining; Suspects to Be Sent to Shanghai</h3>
<p>According to reports received by the Zhejiang Provincial Security Command, a large-scale counterfeit currency operation has been cracked down in Mamuxiang, Haining County, Zhejiang Province, which forged a large number of 5,000 yuan customs gold notes. All the suspects have been arrested. It is rumored that the case involves a wide range of people, so they will be sent to the relevant authorities in this city for interrogation within days. The printing of the counterfeit currency is blurry, especially the image of Sun Yat-sen. The words "5,000 Yuan Customs Gold" are also relatively crude, and the "制" (manufactured) character in "Central Mint" is even more muddled. It is rumored that some of the counterfeit currency has been used in Shanghai, so citizens are urged to pay close attention.</p>
<h3>The Second Phase of Charity Housing Lottery Tickets: Cannot Be Issued for the Time Being</h3>
<p>Can Only Be Realized After Prices Stabilize</p>
<p>Regarding the issuance of the second phase of charity housing lottery tickets, according to reports obtained by reporters, it is still being prepared by the Housing Charity Lottery Department of the Shanghai Relief Committee. The issue of the land base for building the houses was previously resolved by the department after responsible surveys of two locations in Nanshi and Zhabei. However, because the land purchase group (Land Administration Bureau) has not yet negotiated the price of the land, it is impossible to build. At the same time, land owners often regard the land as a hot commodity and are unwilling to sell it due to recent price fluctuations that are too intense. However, Mayor Wu is still striving to promote this work, because this is the only way to solve the housing shortage in this city. Mr. Wu also hopes that all parties involved in preparing the charity houses will sincerely and quickly cooperate. It is rumored that the issuance date of the second phase of charity housing lottery tickets will only be realized after prices stabilize somewhat.</p>

<h3>Organizing People's Self-Defense Force: Municipal Government Is Reviewing the Draft Proposed by the Civil Police Bureau; It Has Been Decided That an Armed Regular Force Will Not Be Established for the Time Being</h3>
<p>The Municipal Government previously received instructions from higher authorities to quickly organize a people's self-defense force in accordance with the provisions of the Local Autonomy Act. The Civil Police Bureau is now drafting the organizational plan for the people's self-defense force and submitting it to the municipal meeting last week. As a result of the discussion, because the draft still had some shortcomings, it was sent to the Councilors' Office for review. It is understood that the organization of the team includes a general team, a brigade, a company, and a squad. The mayor, Wu, will serve concurrently as the general team leader, the district chiefs of each district will serve concurrently as the brigade leaders, and the city government will appoint the brigade deputy. The company leaders and squad leaders will be held by the Baojia (local administrative units) chiefs. All men between the ages of 20 and 45 can participate as members. The source of funding for the people's self-defense force is still under discussion. A training committee will be established to be responsible for training matters.

Without a doubt, Longhua Airport will have a leading position as a long-distance air station. The design of this terminal building was created by many of the most prestigious mechanical and architectural experts in the country, including the technical personnel who built the Chengdu Airport during the war.</p>
<h3>The Quality of Milk Is Far Inferior to the Past: Health Authorities Are Strictly Managing; Samples Are Taken Every Morning</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] Before the war, when the milk parlors in this city were managed by the Public Works Department, they were divided into ATT, A, and B levels based on their equipment and quality. There were a total of 28 parlors with 1,946 dairy cows, producing 36,042 pounds of milk per day. Among them, the four ATT-level parlors had the cleanest dairy cows and the most reliable products. The authorities' management and inspection of each parlor were extremely strict. After the war, the districts in the suburbs were merged into the municipal government, and the inspection and management of milk were all handled by the Health Bureau. In addition to the levels still being divided into the three levels before the war, the milk parlors in Nanshi and Pudong had no disinfection equipment, so they were all classified as C-level. According to last year's statistics, there were a total of 65 milk parlors in the city, of which 47 were C-level alone. Although the number of dairy cows has increased by about one time compared to pre-war, with 3,756 cows, the daily milk production is only 39,262 pounds. The Health Bureau's funding is tight, and its manpower is insufficient, so the management and inspection have not been able to exert their maximum function. Therefore, apart from a few foreign merchant ranches and a small number of Chinese ranches, which have excellent disinfection equipment, so users can rest assured to order and drink, the rest are inevitably somewhat wary. The rules for inspecting milk parlors recently formulated by the Health Bureau are extremely strict, such as dairy cows, milk, livestock, milk parlors, environment, milking, and bottling. At the same time, personnel are dispatched every morning to intercept milk deliverers along the way and take milk for sampling. From January to May of this year, a total of 459 samples were taken for bacterial and chemical tests. Among them, 70 were unqualified, and the proportion was still small. However, in one and a half months in June, 85 items were inspected, and as many as 32 were unqualified. Now that summer is approaching, drinkers of milk should pay attention. Bacteria in milk can still be safe if boiled, but the most feared is that the milk contains tuberculosis bacteria, which is extremely dangerous for infants to drink. As for the number of dairy cows with tuberculosis in this city, there are still no formal statistics. It is hoped that the health authorities will conduct a comprehensive inspection, strictly crack down on sick cows, and provide a safety guarantee for citizens who drink milk.</p>
<h3>Expanding Inspection of Unclean Food and Drink: A Cleanliness Supervision Team Will Be Organized</h3>
<p>The Municipal Health Bureau believes that with the arrival of summer and hot weather, the health of citizens is extremely important. In order to ensure the health of citizens in summer and to better prevent unclean drinks, in addition to organizing a street cold drink patrol team to regularly inspect and strictly crack down on unclean cold drinks, it has now been decided to organize a cleanliness supervision team to expand the scope of inspection of all unclean foods and drinks. In addition to stalls, all restaurants and cold drink shops will also be strictly inspected. It is rumored that the captain of the team has decided to be held concurrently by Yang Mingding, director of the bureau.</p>
<h3>Cooperative Enterprise Inspection Team: A Review Meeting Will Be Held Today</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] The Cooperative Enterprise Inspection Team in this city went to various cooperative societies in groups from the 5th to the 28th of last month for inspection, and all tasks have been completed. The Cooperative Section of the Bureau of Social Affairs has scheduled a review meeting this afternoon, inviting various units participating in the inspection. The attending units are the Municipal Council, the China Farmers Bank, the Central Cooperative Treasury, the Cooperative Enterprise Supply and Sales Office of the Ministry of Social Affairs, the Municipal Party Headquarters, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, and the General Labor Union. According to Zou Jinxi, the head of the Cooperative Section of the Social Affairs Bureau, to reporters yesterday: "The inspection team inspected more than 300 cooperative units of various types this time, and the overall results are in line with the standards. The inspection team also plans to select a small number of units with the best results as model cooperative societies, which will be supported by the financial and material institutions of this city in the future. At least a small number of non-standard units will be dissolved after review at today's meeting."</p>

<h3>The Gold Banknote Case of a Stateless Person: Involving People from Fifteen Countries; Evidence Includes U.S. Dollars, Diamonds, U.S. Military Identification Cards, Etc.</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] The stateless person Hans' Obrenz was arrested and interrogated by the Jingjing Brigade of the Police Bureau on the 21st of last month on suspicion of running a black market in gold banknotes, and was transferred to the Special Criminal Court for handling a few days ago. According to police sources, the black market in gold banknotes run by Obrenz involves people from as many as fifteen countries. Earlier, the police bureau received a confidential report about Obrenz in April of this year and immediately began to monitor Obrenz. After the confidential report was found to be true after interrogation, the Jingjing Brigade began to act at 10:00 AM on the 20th of last month, searched Obrenz's residence, and arrested Obrenz. The police bureau immediately questioned Obrenz based on the seized items. Obrenz directly admitted to running a black market in gold banknotes and various illegal acts. The police bureau then summoned several people involved based on Obrenz's confession, and obtained many clues about their illegal acts. However, some of the people involved in the case are temporarily or permanently residing abroad, and their whereabouts are temporarily unknown. However, the Jingjing Brigade stated that it would never give up the investigation, and would take action as soon as possible. The main points of the situation of the various cases committed by Obrenz are explored and recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Three Cases Involving Debt Disputes</p>
<p>The first case involves Felix Gilbert and Kctzmann. The former is now in Australia, and the latter's whereabouts are unknown. When the scholar was in Shanghai, Obrenz borrowed $1,000 USD from him, but he soon repaid it. Later, he borrowed another $1,000 USD from Jill, and as a result, he returned Jill's principal of $220 USD and interest of $721 USD. Later, Jill went to Australia and transferred the debt to Gao Zi. Obrenz admitted that he had repaid the difference in the old debt with U.S. dollars, but because there was a separate agreement with Gao, he only paid $100 USD.</p>
<p>The second case involves Landan and Frenkl, both of whom are currently in Australia. He admitted that he had paid 50 U.S. dollars to the Way (Frank's representative) in order to repay his debts. The third case involves a Mrs. Trude Neumann, which is a dispute over a legal currency debt.</p>
<p>U.S. Dollar Check Returned for Insufficient Funds</p>
<p>The fourth case involves the illegal sale of foreign currency checks. Obrenz purchased a U.S. dollar check for 200 yuan from a Swedish shipowner named Bryer and resold it to an American pilot. After the pilot sent the check to the United States for cashing, it was returned due to insufficient funds. The fifth case also involves two foreigners. The document is a debt list issued by a Swiss bank on May 21 of this year.</p>
<p>The sixth case also involves two foreigners. A man named Ave intends to borrow $3,000 USD from Obrenz and agrees to pay a monthly interest of $525 USD. Obrenz obtained a loan from another foreigner named Pi, but stated that Obrenz should receive a commission of $125 USD out of the $525 USD monthly interest.</p>
<p>The seventh case involves three foreigners, one of whom is now in Beiping and is also a pilot. The case is complicated and involves $1,000 USD.</p>
<p>The eighth case has not yet obtained physical evidence from the police bureau. However, Obrenz admitted that on the 19th of last month, he exchanged 50 U.S. dollars for a foreign Mrs. Qi at the black market price.</p>
<p>One Gold Pound from the Street</p>
<p>In the ninth case, the police bureau seized a gold pound and 688 U.S. dollars. He admitted that they were purchased from various people on the street, but the names were unknown.</p>
<p>In the tenth case, Obrenz was found to be in possession of the identity cards of two U.S. soldiers. Since the people involved in the case are under the jurisdiction of U.S. military regulations, the police bureau has transferred the case to the U.S. military intelligence department for investigation, but has not yet received a reply.</p>
<p>The eleventh case involves three diamonds and two foreigners. Although there is a lack of physical evidence in the case, Obrenz has admitted that the first diamond was purchased from a Chinese employee of a commercial bank. The diamond was priced in U.S. dollars, and the payment was made in yuan at the current U.S. dollar value. The second diamond was purchased from a German Jewish refugee living in Hongkou for 300 U.S. dollars. The third diamond was purchased with legal currency. Obrenz later sold one diamond to Culltsust for 920 U.S. dollars, and another diamond was priced at 350 U.S. dollars and sold to another Jewish refugee.</p>
<p>According to the police bureau, in the above eleven cases, except for the third and tenth cases, which do not constitute criminal acts, Obrenz has admitted that he has committed as many as nine crimes in a short period of eight months, and he should be punished according to the law.</p>
<h3>The Fourth Father's Day: Extensive Publicity and Preparatory Commemoration</h3>
<p>August 8th marks the fourth Father's Day commemoration. The Promotion Committee, starting in early July, held a series of subcommittee meetings to discuss the proceedings. It was decided that, in addition to the publicity plan and commemorative ceremony being handled as usual, 88 prominent figures from all walks of life would be newly appointed as promotion committee members. The remaining work plan is as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Promoting the student aid campaign: This fundamental task should continue to be actively carried out. On the one hand, members of the association will donate funds to support students.

<p>(6) Opening of charitable organizations for visits: Charitable organizations will be contacted in advance to open their doors for visits during the festival, to promote the spirit of fatherly love and the psychology of caring for children.</p>
<p>(7) Expanding publicity: The association will send letters to major newspapers in advance to promote the significance of Father's Day as much as possible.</p>
<p>(8) Charity sale of commemorative badges: Organized by the Youth Association, newspaper boys and school students will be dispatched to sell commemorative badges or fresh flowers, with all proceeds going to student aid.</p>
<p>(9) Showing lantern slides: Around Father's Day, the association plans to ask movie theaters to show lantern slides to arouse the audience's filial piety.</p>
<p>(10) Individual commemorations at home: The association advocates that Father's Day should not be held as a public ceremony, but rather commemorated individually at home. According to regulations, children should wear red flowers (white flowers for deceased fathers) to pay their respects to their fathers and offer gifts. For fathers traveling far away, send a family letter to wish them good health. The goal is to deeply instill this filial piety festival in people's hearts, to encourage good customs, promote public welfare, and strive to serve the society and the country, in accordance with the broad sense of filial piety.</p>
<h3>Impersonating an Inspector to Extort Money: Dockyard Manager on Trial</h3>
<p>Zhao Tiejun from Nantong, 34 years old, manages water transport affairs at the No. 4 dock on the Bund in this city. Last month, Cheng Yuren, a quartermaster from the Haimen County Self-Defense Corps, came to Shanghai to purchase 50 bags of military rice, but without a permit, it was piled up on the dock, making it impossible to ship. Zhao Tiejun, seeing this situation and thinking he could take advantage of it, impersonated an officer from the Garrison Headquarters Inspectorate and extorted 50 million yuan from him. Of this, 20 million yuan was for transportation costs, and the rest was pocketed by Zhao. Unexpectedly, after Cheng returned to Haimen, he reported this to the county government, which in turn requested the Shanghai-Songhu Garrison Headquarters to investigate. Zhao was arrested and transferred to the court for trial. The case was publicly tried in the Eighth Criminal Court by Judge Mei Erhe of the District Court the day before yesterday. According to the defendant's confession, he only took 20 million yuan from Cheng at the time. Of this, 10 million yuan was for transportation costs, 5 million yuan for water transport fees, 3 million yuan for tips for the coolies and cigarette money, and another 2 million yuan for the sailors' drinking money, and he himself did not receive a single penny. As a result, the court decided to reschedule the case for further verification.</p>
<h3>Hardship of Life Leads to More Crimes: Chief Prosecutor Says the Consequences are Worrisome; Wang Zhibin's Case Will Be Handled According to Law</h3>
<p>Cha Liangjian, the Chief Prosecutor of the District Court, met with reporters yesterday and pointed out that with the current soaring prices and economic difficulties, the number of criminal cases in the city is gradually increasing, and the consequences are worrying. He said: Judicial officers observe with a fair eye during trials. Among theft offenders, there are fewer evil people, and most are good people who are forced by the hardships of life to take risks, resulting in legal sanctions. Their criminal behavior is unforgivable under the law, but their situation is indeed pitiful, as exemplified by the case of Wu Chao. Cha firmly believes that after the government stabilizes the economy and people's lives become stable, criminal cases will definitely decrease. He continued that judges are like doctors. When treating patients, they must hope that their condition improves. When judges are trying criminals, they also use their sense of justice to advise criminals to repent and start anew. Cha pays close attention to the discipline of the three detention centers under the court's jurisdiction, often visiting them around 9:00 PM to inspect whether there are any negligence of duty or illegal activities, and sometimes interrogating prisoners to inquire about their life in prison and whether they have been wronged. Cha also told reporters that among the criminal cases recently handled by the court, there are more theft and opium addiction cases, while civil debt lawsuits have been greatly reduced. He hopes that the media will strengthen publicity about the consequences of opium addiction, emphasize the importance of eradicating opium, in order to eliminate it. Cha stated that the case of Wang Zhibin, a legislator of the Democratic Socialist Party, who was recently accepted by the court for drug trafficking, will be handled according to law, and the police and the court are currently investigating the case.</p>
<h3>Learning to Swim: Two Children Tragically Drowned</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] Yesterday afternoon at around 3:30 PM, two children drowned in the pond of the Guanghua Coal Depot at No. 585 Guangfu Road, Zhabei. The children were Zhu, 12 years old, residing at Xisiwenli (No. 222) of Binnan Da Avenue, and Ruan Jinde, 16 years old, residing at No. 286 in the same neighborhood. The two children went to the pond yesterday to learn to swim, but because they did not know how to swim, they tragically drowned after entering the water and died instantly. They were then discovered by someone who tried to retrieve their bodies. The Zhabei Branch Bureau, which is only a wall away, dispatched Officer Wang Shusheng and police officers to investigate upon hearing the news and transported the bodies to the autopsy station on Changde Road. According to an employee of the coal depot, the factory was originally occupied by the Japanese during the enemy-puppet period and operated as a steel factory. The air-raid shelter built by them covers an area of about two or three acres. Over time, it filled with stagnant water to a depth of more than ten feet, transforming into a pond. Today, coincidentally, was the day for distributing rationed coal briquettes, and the gate was open, which led to this unfortunate event.</p>
<h3>Murderer in Guangxi Road Case Arrested in Yuyao and Escorted to Shanghai</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] At around 6:35 AM on the 8th of last month, in the back厢房 on the second floor of No. 16, Lane 297, Guangxi Road, the three tenants Lai Guoqing and his wife, Lai Zhang Yinji, were fast asleep when Li Renjin (also known as Li Wu, from Jiangbei), who lived with them, broke into the room, holding a sharp knife, and stabbed Lai Guoqing in the vital parts of his abdomen, killing him instantly. Lai's wife, Zhang Yinji, was also cut twice on her arm, and the blood flowed non-stop. The murderer then fled. Afterwards, officers Song Shaomei, Police Chief Liu Zutong, and Li Junkun rushed to investigate and took Li Saiwang, his third younger sister, and his friend Yang Yinshan to the bureau for interrogation and launched a search in all directions, but to no avail. On the 26th of last month, the branch bureau received a tip that Li Renjin was hiding in the home of his sister-in-law, Xu Xiaomei, in the棚户 in East Yuhang Road, Baoding Road. They then sent officers to bring Xu in for questioning. According to her statement, Li Renjin, looking disheveled, did go to her home on the 11th and asked to borrow some travel expenses, saying that someone had introduced him as a conscript for one hundred million yuan to be sent to the Changshu County Government. Upon learning of this, the branch bureau sent officials to Changshu, submitted a letter to the county government, requesting their assistance. After investigating for three days, they found nothing. The officer in charge returned to Shanghai. On the 29th, they received a telegram from the Changshu County Government, stating that Li Renjin, the murderer in the Guangxi Road blood case, had fled to Changshu after the incident and enlisted as a volunteer soldier in Lucun Town, was recommended to join the camp of the Ninth Regiment of the 保送, and had been captured in Zhitang. They could immediately send officers to escort him back for handling. After receiving the telegram, the bureau chief Zhao selected officials to go to Changshu and escorted him back to Shanghai on the 30th to be investigated. It is understood that the reason for stabbing Lai Guoqing to death was to rob him of his gold ring, gold watch and other ornaments.</p>

<h3>Joint Power Plant: Unrealized Date; Reportedly After Investigation by the U.S. Aid Representative, Interest in This Plan is Reduced</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] The Sino-American Joint Power Company's plan originally occupied an important position in the U.S. aid construction special fund. The U.S. side planned to invest 20 million U.S. dollars to complete this plan in five years, so that the city would never be short of electricity in the future and to prepare for future industrial expansion. However, it has recently been reported that after the U.S. aid delegation came to Shanghai for investigation, they believed that according to the current electricity price calculation standard in China, existing power plants will not be able to maintain, let alone expand and build new plants, so they are no longer interested in the original joint power company plan. In order to clarify the truth, the reporter interviewed relevant senior personnel yesterday. According to them, whether the joint power company's plan will be implemented is still under discussion. The opinions within the Stillman investigation team on this matter are not consistent, but Stillman himself advocates the implementation of this plan. The decision-making power in this matter is actually in the hands of the U.S. government. The decision will be made when Stillman completes his debriefing in the U.S. and comes to China again. It is heard that the U.S. Aid Operations Association has another plan to solve the power shortage, which is to increase the power generation capacity of existing power plants, because the joint power plant will take five years to succeed, and the power cannot be increased during this period, so there is a feeling that it is too late to help. However, the largest power company here still has confidence in realizing the ideal of a joint power plant and believes that the electricity price issue will be reasonably resolved by the Chinese government sooner or later. It is also learned that Shen Xirui, Secretary-General of the U.S. Aid Operations Association, said: The U.S. is dissatisfied with the excessively low electricity prices, but has not heard of any negativity towards the joint power plant plan.</p>
<h3>Family Suffers Tragedy at the Hands of Bandits: Mother, Son, and Wife Slaughtered; Anhui Civil Servant Deeply Affected, Swallows Vaccine to Seek Death, Rescued</h3>
<p>Yesterday afternoon at 4:30 PM, a middle-aged man suddenly snatched a vaccine at the Anti-Epidemic Injection Station stationed at the North Railway Station, poured it into his stomach, and attempted to commit suicide. The nurse discovered it and quickly snatched it away. Half a bottle of vaccine had already been swallowed. The road police urgently sent him to the Railway Hospital for an enema. By 6:00 PM, he was out of danger. The man's name is Zhu Mingjian, an employee of the Anhui Provincial Water Conservancy Bureau, originally from Taixing, Jiangsu. Recently, his 86-year-old mother, wife, and one son and one daughter were too deeply stimulated by the Communist bandits in Taixing. In his resentment, he suddenly developed the thought of death.</p>
<h3>Vehicles Without Replaced Uniform License Plates are Prohibited from Traveling in the City Starting Today</h3>
<p>The Public Utilities Bureau's handling of the replacement of uniform license plates was originally scheduled to end at the end of June. However, due to various reasons, such as some vehicle owners leaving Shanghai, repairs being underway, inconsistent seals, and address changes, they failed to apply as scheduled. Therefore, after discussion by the bureau, it was approved to be extended to the end of July. It is now learned that the overdue application for license plate replacement for the vehicles has been officially closed. The bureau specifically announced that from today, all large and small vehicles (trucks, passenger cars, motorcycles) with Guo and Hu license plates that have not replaced their uniform license plates, except for test vehicle license plates, as well as vehicles from other cities with Guo and Hu license plates, are prohibited from traveling in the city.</p>

<h3>Weekly Forum: On This Year's Budget for the Second Half (Continued from Yesterday)</h3>
<p>— Zhang Baiyi</p>
<p>I believe that the government today already possesses two major sources of revenue: one is the four billion US dollars in American aid, and the other is state-owned property (including American surplus materials, lend-lease materials, enemy and puppet industries, and Japanese reparations). These already provide the prerequisites for currency reform. The government today may as well base the exchange rate between the new currency and the legal tender (fapi) on the recent price of four million times (that is, approximately the current market price of silver dollars), i.e., four million fapi exchanged for one new currency unit. At this time, the government can issue 250 million yuan of the new currency, which can recover all the fapi. In this way, the people will regain confidence in the currency, and the remaining currency income will still be deposited in banks. The banks can then restore their original banking functions, thereby controlling the people's purchasing power and having sufficient funds to finance agricultural and industrial production. Once the fapi is completely withdrawn, the government may as well announce that the Central Bank is completely independent from the Ministry of Finance. The agency business of the national treasury can still be entrusted to the Central Bank, but the Central Bank will no longer be obligated to provide advances for the national treasury. After the Central Bank is independent, if the National Treasury Bureau of the Central Bank discovers that the national treasury deposits are insufficient, it can request the Ministry of Finance to issue new public bonds or mortgage materials to make up for the shortage. After the Central Bank is independent, the credit of the exchange coupons issued by the Central Bank can increase a thousandfold to ten thousandfold. After the currency credit is established, it can also restore the credit of the Ministry of Finance. The Ministry of Finance can smoothly sell public bonds or short-term treasury bills. However, according to my calculations, it is not necessary to issue public bonds in the second half of this year.</p>
<p>The issuance of 250 million yuan of the new currency can certainly recover all the fapi, but the issuance of 250 million yuan of the new currency will of course still be insufficient for the entire market. If you want to increase it to the pre-war level of 1.4 billion yuan, wouldn't it become disguised inflation? But the fact is not so. When the new currency restores currency credit, the value of gold, US dollars, foreign currencies, silver dollars, rice, and other "physical currencies" circulating on the black market today, which replace the status of fapi, will all be lost. The original circulation space of these "physical currencies" will be occupied by the new currency. For example, urban housing leases will no longer use gold and US dollars as payment tools, and rural areas will also stop using rice and silver dollars as payment tools. The issuance needs caused by the new currency occupying the circulation space of a physical currency will definitely not affect prices, so the value of the new currency itself will not be depreciated as a result.</p>
<p>After the currency system reform, the budget calculation unit will be changed to the new currency. The draft budget that I have proposed is as follows:</p>
<p>Draft National Budget for the Second Half of the 37th Year (Unit: New Currency Yuan) Revenue Section</p>
<p>1. Tax Revenue 250,000,000</p>
<p>2. Loan Revenue 500,000,000</p>
<p>3. State-Owned Property Revenue 1,162,500,000</p>
<p>(1) Income from the Sale of US Surplus Materials and Lend-Lease Materials 75,000,000</p>
<p>(2) Income from the Sale of Enemy and Puppet Property Materials 25,000,000</p>
<p>(3) Income from the Sale of Japanese Reparations Materials 3,500,000</p>
<p>(4) Income from the Sale of State-Owned Enterprises 800,000,000</p>
<p>(5) Profit Income from State-Owned Enterprises 250,000,000</p>
<p>Total Revenue 1,93,500,000</p>
<p>Expenditure Section</p>
<p>1. Military and Police Expenditure 875,000,000</p>
<p>2. Economic Construction Expenditure 625,000,000</p>
<p>3. Other Government Affairs Expenditure 43,000,000</p>
<p>Total Expenditure 1,93,500,000</p>
<p>The tax revenue of 250 million yuan is far lower than before the war. According to the report of the Ministry of Finance, the tax revenue in the 25th year of the Republic of China (actual receipt by the national treasury) reached 1.057 billion yuan, and the administrative and business revenue reached 36 million yuan. Among the tax revenue, customs duties accounted for 636 million yuan, salt tax accounted for 247 million yuan, and consolidated tax accounted for 131 million yuan. Therefore, the 250 million yuan that I have set is not excessive for the burden capacity of industry and commerce. The loan income is based on the American aid loan that has already been signed, with 250 million US dollars converted into 500 million new currency yuan based on the current free exchange rate and domestic prices, i.e., two new currency yuan are equal to one US dollar. Because the US dollar has also experienced inflation during the war, increasing from 6 billion yuan before the war to about 28 billion yuan today, it has actually increased by three and a half times, but because the production volume of American materials has also increased, it is not excessive to have two new currency yuan to one US dollar.</p>
<p>However, what deserves special attention here is the issue of China's internal debt repayment. This internal debt includes all fapi public bonds, customs gold bonds, US dollar public bonds, pound public bonds, and US dollar treasury bills issued domestically. If these public bonds are all repaid with their principal and interest in the new currency, the national treasury will definitely not have this burden capacity. If you want to reluctantly maintain creditworthiness, you can only promote financial bankruptcy. However, if currency system reform is not implemented due to difficulties in repaying debts, the disadvantages are as mentioned above. All things must have both advantages and disadvantages, and the choice of policy should be determined by comparing the advantages and disadvantages. I believe that the government can only handle this public debt in a separate case. Reforming the currency system is the only way to improve finances, so reforming the currency system is all beneficial and without harm. Even if there are disadvantages due to debt repayment problems, the degree of harm is much lighter than the harm of not reforming the currency system. Moreover, if the currency system is not changed, the losses of public bond holders have already become a fait accompli, so currency system reform is a necessary and urgent measure. I suggest that there are two principles for the treatment of public bonds after the currency system reform, and one can be chosen: one is to freeze all domestic public bonds and implement an indefinite suspension of principal and interest payments, and resume payments when the finances and national treasury have the capacity to pay principal and interest; the other is to implement a public bond exchange system, in which all domestic public bonds are uniformly exchanged for new unified public bonds, including gold public bonds. Exchange new currency-denominated public bonds according to the original actual price of various public bonds and then give a uniform discount. The repayment period is also extended to the next four or fifty years or even a hundred years. This issue is very important and the government must be careful about it.</p>
<p>The government also needs to reform the tax collection technology. Not all tax collectors in the tax administration system are necessarily corrupt, but observing the recent emergence of corruption cases in various tax agencies, we must pay special attention to it. Although the government has established an audit system for this matter, established a public treasury system, and the National Treasury Department of the Ministry of Finance also has a roving audit facility, corruption cases are still prevalent. We must know that if tax collectors collude with taxpayers, they may reduce the national treasury's tax revenue by more than half. I have previously proposed that the government establish a unified industrial and commercial tax, similar to a tax-farming system, in which local industrial and commercial groups directly pay to local treasury banks. This method can not only increase the national treasury's tax revenue, but also facilitate industry and commerce, and save the government a considerable amount of tax collection expenditure. I believe that the types of taxes that can be changed to a unified industrial and commercial tax include industrial and commercial income tax, business income tax, industrial and commercial salary and remuneration income tax, securities deposit income tax, property sale income tax, property lease income tax, excessive profits tax during extraordinary periods, business tax, goods export tax, mining tax, and goods tax on cotton yarn tax, wheat flour tax, cement tax, liquor tax, beverage tax, sugar tax, tea leaf tax, bamboo and wood tax, fur tax, porcelain tax, paper foil tax, match tax, cigarette tax, etc. Goods suppression taxes can all be abolished and completely merged into the unified industrial and commercial tax, and local industrial and commercial groups agree with the Ministry of Finance on an amount and collect it in four seasons. For example, in Shanghai, it is assumed that the unified industrial and commercial tax is currently 200 trillion yuan per year in legal tender, and then the industrial and commercial groups will determine a certain amount and the industrial and commercial groups will separately notify each factory and store to recognize and pay. If this method is implemented, it is believed that the industrial and commercial sector will also welcome it.</p>
<p>Before selling state-owned property, it is necessary to consider whether the financial policy is self-contradictory. For example, today the government is planning to sell enemy and puppet industries, surplus materials, lend-lease materials, and Japanese reparations materials, but at the same time, it is planning to levy property taxes. The government plans to levy property taxes in order to increase tax revenue and reduce inflation, which seems quite reasonable in principle; but you must know that at a time when capital is constantly flowing out and factories and exporters are moving in large numbers to special areas such as Hong Kong, if you want to levy property taxes again, it will inevitably promote their courage to escape overseas. At the same time, if you want to levy property taxes and sell state-owned property, I would like to ask who is more willing to buy state-owned property if they have funds? Increasing tax revenue to make up for deficits is the foundation of sound finance, but it must also be considered from an economic point of view whether it has disadvantages. If the degree of its disadvantages affects the tax source and the entire national economy and people's livelihood, it must be avoided. Moreover, at present, there is no problem with the source of wealth, so the property tax levy case seems to be abandoned. Moreover, the property tax is a tax levied on the tax rate, unless it is absolutely necessary, can it be tried tentatively.</p>
<p>However, currency system reform also takes a considerable amount of time, and it is by no means possible to do it all at once. However, if the financial budget is to be sound, it must be changed to the new currency unit immediately. In this gradual process, I believe that this problem can be solved by the following methods. That is, the budget for the second half of this year should be calculated immediately in new currency units, but it will not be announced immediately. At the same time, before the currency system is reformed, the government should issue a currency system reform reserve savings certificate, denominated in one tael of gold, priced at 150 million to 300 million yuan per tael, interest-free, with a period of one year, and an issuance volume of one million to five million taels, and the principal will be transferred to one tael of gold or a new currency equivalent to one tael of gold upon maturity. The issuance of this currency system reform reserve savings certificate can prove the government's determination to reform the currency system within a certain period of time, and it can also guarantee that the value of those who purchase savings certificates with legal tender will be absolutely maintained. If the government takes this opportunity to absorb trillions of yuan of legal tender, it can control the people's purchasing power of trillions of yuan of legal tender, so that the people's purchasing power no longer flows to the market space of US dollars, legal tender, foreign exchange, gold, silver dollars, and goods, thereby promoting the balance of prices and the stability of the currency, and the currency system reform can be carried out smoothly. Some say that if the government does not have this gold to repay the principal at that time, problems will inevitably occur, but because there is a new currency to repay the principal, this problem can be solved satisfactorily. The purpose of purchasing this gold certificate is to maintain its monetary value. When the value of gold and the new currency is stable at that time, both gold and the new currency will be welcome. For example, when gold deposits were implemented during the war, many people were willing to receive legal tender when they matured, because the price of gold had not changed much at that time.</p>
<p>In short, although my country's finances have gone through eight years of the War of Resistance and three years of suppression of the rebellion, the foundation of finance is quite sound due to the nationalization of a large number of enemy and puppet materials after the end of the War of Resistance, the transformation of a large number of enemy factories into state-owned enterprises, and the acquisition of a large number of reparations materials. In addition, there is also the acquisition of foreign loans, the acquisition of American surplus materials, lend-lease materials, and relief materials, and finance is usually not difficult. In addition, due to the increase in the area of tax collection after the war, the recovery and restoration of production in major factory areas, the income from taxes should also increase. Moreover, due to the restoration of international trade, customs duties cannot be compared with those during the war. It is a strange thing in the world that a victorious country has compensation income and foreign loan income, but it cannot solve its finances, so it still relies on inflation as its main policy?

<h3>Two New Warships: Chongqing and Lingfu</h3>
<p>— Our Reporter: Zijian</p>
<p>[Our Hong Kong Dispatch, July 29] The two British-donated ships "Chongqing" and "Lingfu," which had been rumored for two months, sailed into Hong Kong, the gateway to southern China, at about 10:00 a.m. on the 28th, after a storm and still in dim weather. Just a few hours after anchoring, the destroyer "Lingfu" was ordered to go to sea to search for a small patrol boat belonging to the Fourth Naval District, which shows how urgent the country needs these two new ships, and it is no wonder that overseas Chinese warmly welcome them and eagerly expect them.</p>
<p>After hearing the news, overseas Chinese rushed to the seaside to watch, but they can only look at the graceful appearance of the new ships published in the newspaper, and they cannot go to the coast to watch, because the new ships are ordered by someone else to be anchored in the Kowloon Bay, outside the urban area, outside the Kai Tak Airport, and it takes more than an hour by electric boat to get there. In the past, foreign warships that sailed into Hong Kong were mostly anchored near the naval dockyard or the sea off Sai Wan, but this time they were led to a cold and quiet bay. When a reporter from a certain newspaper boarded the cruiser "Chongqing" to interview Captain Deng Zhaoxiang, he asked him in a pleading tone whether he could sail the two ships closer to the urban sea so that the overseas Chinese could see them first. He replied, "I have the heart but not the power, please forgive the overseas Chinese"! It turned out that on the way, that is, when the overseas Chinese groups were holding a meeting to prepare for the welcome, he received a notice from the Hong Kong Navy about the location of the anchor when arriving in Hong Kong.</p>
<p>The clothing and equipment of the soldiers on the ship are all British-style, and there is a young man who even grew a beard, looking like an old British sailor. After they heard the speech of Commander Yang of the Fourth Naval District on the ship, some of them were granted leave to go ashore for sightseeing, so the overseas Chinese had a real opportunity to see the heroic appearance of the new navy of the motherland.</p>
<p>The new ships have accepted a five-day reception schedule organized by overseas Chinese groups in Hong Kong, with welcome and expectation combined. If it were not for the fact that the "Lingfu" suffered some mechanical problems due to fighting the storm just before it arrived at the gate of the country and had to be docked for minor repairs, it would have been able to sail into the Huangpu River and meet with the dear compatriots within seven days.</p>
<h3>Bloodshed in Changshu Shazhou District: Two Village Chiefs Brutally Murdered</h3>
<p>[Our Changshu Dispatch, July 31] Tao Guifang, the village chief of the 17th village of Fuping Township, has been quite successful in handling conscription and grain collection on weekdays. The weather was very hot the night before, and Tao did not sleep until 10 o'clock. Before long, someone knocked on the door, claiming to be checking the household registration. Tao did not suspect anything and opened the door in his clothes. Four people were guarding outside, and three people rushed in, all holding short guns and shining a strong electric light on Tao's face, making Tao unable to open his eyes. They spoke with a common accent and asked Tao for cash and gold bars. Tao replied that he did not have any at the moment. Unexpectedly, the bandits fired their guns and committed murder, firing a total of four shots. Tao shouted madly and fell to the ground, dying instantly. The bandits fled immediately. The next morning, after receiving the report, the District Procuratorate sent Prosecutor Shen and Inspector Song to the countryside to examine the body. It was confirmed that he died from gunshot wounds, so the family was instructed to collect the body.</p>
<h3>Two Men and One Woman: Wuxi Female Ballad Singer Zhang Lijun Files a Lawsuit, Seemingly Indicating a Love Triangle</h3>
<p>[Our Wuxi Dispatch, July 31] Female ballad singer Zhang Lijun was performing "Yang Naiwu" at the Tong Yuchun Book Market in Dahechi, this county. Unexpectedly, late the day before yesterday, she suddenly shouted for help in her room; the next day, she accompanied her father, Shaoquan, to the police station to accuse Zhang Xilin, the young boss of the book market, of attempting rape. Because the mediation failed, she was transferred to the District Procuratorate in the afternoon. According to the testimony: "At about 1:00 a.m., someone broke into Lijun's room, grabbed her eyebrows with one hand, and intended to commit indecent assault. Lijun shouted in a hurry, and only Zhang Xilin was seen in the room when the lights were turned on." Xilin testified that he heard the shouting and rushed to catch the adulterer. At that time, Zhang Yanheng, an employee of the flour shop to the left, was also inside, so the situation was quite tortuous, possibly a love triangle, and the blame was shifted to Jiangdong. As a result of the court hearing, the defendant was released on bail.</p>
<h3>Guiyang City Cracks Down on Underground Banks</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Guiyang, 1st] Guiyang City is currently cracking down on underground banks.

<h3>Sun Pusheng Case: Witnesses Subpoenaed, Corpse Coffin to be Transported to Cheng for Examination</h3>
<p>[Our Jiangyin Dispatch, July 31] In the case of Sun Pusheng, a resident of Baizhangli, Xiyangqiao, Mazhen, being killed, his father, Sun Guanyi, accused the township chief Niu Yusheng of dereliction of duty and murder to the District Court. The District Procuratorate opened a court session for interrogation at 10:00 a.m. on the 31st and ordered the bailiff Lu Dapeng to subpoena the plaintiff Sun Guanyi, the witness Huang Enrong (a member of the Xiyangqiao Council), the former township chief Huang Qichang, and Sun Fusheng and others. The defendant, Mazhen Township Chief Niu Yusheng, the person involved, Chen Xingbao, a member of the Self-Defense Force, and the witness Sun Yaochen (i.e., Jin Da's father) did not arrive. The interrogation was conducted by Prosecutor Zhang Sen. The case involved investigation and was prohibited from being heard by the public. It was only learned that the plaintiff determined that the deceased had no evidence of colluding with bandits and asked what the reason for the killing was, and that torture was used to extract a confession, so he requested to be redressed. The witnesses did not definitively confirm the deceased's suspicion of being a bandit, and they did not witness the killing. The borrowing of rice was a commercial loan from the town office's economic committee to wealthy households and had nothing to do with Sun Pusheng. The interrogation lasted two hours. The court instructed the plaintiff that if the deceased was indeed a bandit and had been killed, the township chief would certainly be in violation of the law, and you would also be difficult to blame. It would be best to settle the matter peacefully. If he is a good citizen who died innocently, he shall be dealt with according to the law, and your son's corpse coffin may be transported to the city within one week for autopsy. The plaintiff insisted that his son was not a bandit and was allowed to return to the countryside to transport the corpse coffin to the city for autopsy to clarify the truth.</p>
<h3>Jiangsu Provincial Supervision Team Arrives in Yangzhou: Punishes Suspected Corrupt Officials: Gu Zuzhen Removed from Office and Arrested</h3>
<p>[Our Jiangdu Dispatch, 1st] On the 11th day of the arrival of the first Jiangsu Provincial Supervision Team in Yangzhou, the team leader, Mai Yun, personally led Commissioner Lin, County Magistrate Wang, and all the staff to inspect the four districts. It was found that the tax revenue accounts of the Fairy Temple Tax Collection and Collection Office were unclear and there was a major suspicion of corruption, so he personally ordered the director Gu Zuzhen to be dismissed from office and investigated, and detained in the county government. This is the first voice of punishing corruption after the Supervision Team left the province. The team left Yangzhou this morning and went to Yiwei.</p>
<h3>Miniature News</h3>
<p>Zhenjiang [Our Dispatch] Lin Xingnan, a resident of No. 4 Yuelang Lane in this county, was suddenly robbed by a lone bandit on the night of July 30. Fortunately, the police were caught on the spot. The bandit Wang Xingkui (nickname Yigenmao), from Haizhou, 45 years old, was found with stolen goods and a White Langlin pistol, one bullet, which has been sent to the Provincial Criminal Police Team for interrogation.</p>
<p>Wujin [Our Dispatch] Former County Magistrate Weng Cheng, who also served as the director of the Food and Grain Office during his tenure, the important person in charge of the office Chu Pinjin is on the run after his removal from office, and Ding Jun has left, so the Food and Grain Office cannot be handed over. The newly appointed Xu Xianzhang was originally scheduled to take office on August 1, but he is also very worried about the unclear accounts of his predecessor. In terms of accumulated grain alone, the Food and Grain Office should have transferred more than 20,000 shi to the Management Committee, but there is no trace of it. At the small group meeting of the Council on the 29th, it was agreed that Weng had embezzled a huge amount of grain and did not hand it over, and had put it all into his private pocket. If it is not recovered, this year's grain levy cannot be promoted. A formal representation is now being launched to the provincial government.</p>
<p>Suzhou [Our Dispatch] The Yangcheng District, which is subordinate to the county, borders Yangcheng Lake and has a low-lying terrain. During the yellow plum flood season, about 1,000 mu of low-lying fields near Taiping Bridge in the district were submerged and could not be sown. The district has reported to the County Food and Grain Office to send personnel to investigate in order to reduce the tax.</p>
<p>Dongtai [Our Dispatch] Dongyi's continuous heavy rain, coupled with the seawater backflow, has evolved into a disaster. And many places have collapsed.</p>
<p>Fengxian [Our Dispatch] The Wang family in Xishi, Qiaozhen, raised an infant who is just one year old. He was no different from ordinary children at first, but recently he fell ill for more than a month. After recovering, it was suddenly discovered that the child's upper lip and lower jaw were covered with a beard, looking like a small man, which was temporarily spread as a strange story, and there were many viewers.</p>
<p>[Another Dispatch] The 37th year's quota for land tax in this county has now been approved by the County Council and decided to be 1.2 dou for the levy quota, 6 sheng for the loan levy, 4.8 he for the public grain, 1.2 sheng for the accumulated grain, and 6 sheng for the school grain, and 5 sheng for the county additional, totaling 3.5 dou.</p>
<h3>Guanwai Travels (2) - A Dream Search in Chijin Fort</h3>
<p>— Our Reporter Song Lin</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper Jiuquan July 28th Airmail] Staying at the Laojunmiao Oil Mine in Yumen for six days, we visited various production and management departments every day, making everyone feel as if they were on a winding mountain road, with too much to take in. On the morning of July 15th, at 9 o'clock, after waving goodbye to the four towering pillars of Laojunmiao, the reporter group's special vehicle once again sped northwest onto the Gobi Desert.</p>
<p>After traveling 25 kilometers, we encountered a checkpoint of the mine police team, just like the checkpoint we encountered on Qingyun Road when entering the mining area. After simply confirming that it was the reporter group's special vehicle, we were allowed to pass. After traveling another five kilometers or so, an oasis suddenly appeared on the edge of the Gobi Desert. This was the Chijin Fort Oil Mine, where a farm was located.</p>
<p>Chijin Fort is under the jurisdiction of Yumen County. Because it is not on the main road, few people pay attention to it. Only when we arrived there in person were we surprised by its beauty, which surpasses all other places outside the customs. The small mountains composed of red and blue sandstone on the north side of the road are the remnants of the Qishu Mountains, forming a strong and beautiful contrast with the large expanse of lush green farmland on the south side of the road. At the foot of the mountain is the Hongshan Temple, built against the mountain. The office of the Yumen Oil Mine Farm is located in the temple at the foot of the mountain. A clear stream flows around the temple. At the foot of the mountain is a tall pagoda, already showing signs of collapse. Rows of white poplars rustle, and green willows sway in the wind. Three or five cattle and horses stroll in the fields. In the garden next to the temple, many precious flowers are planted, ready to be transported to the Laojunmiao mining area for decoration. This farm was established in the 31st year of the Republic (1942). It originally had 100 mu of land. Last year, it acquired another 5,800 mu of land in the East Lake of Chijin Fort, of which 100 mu have been reclaimed. The remaining 4,800 mu are also planned to be reclaimed within three years. According to the director of the farm, Zhu Jiangong, the farm currently has two staff members leading 250 workers to cultivate the land. In addition to wheat, winter vegetables are the main product. Every winter, 20,000 to 30,000 cabbages are transported to the Shantou mining area. There are even more radishes. The farm currently has more than 100 head of cattle, sheep, mules, and horses, and 260 pigs, just enough for the colleagues in the mining area to celebrate a New Year or festival.</p>
<p>As we stepped into the gate of the farm office, we immediately saw a vertical plaque in the main hall: "Tunken Yuantang" (Land Reclamation Office). Inside the main hall, there was also a couplet written by Yu Xueye in the official script: "Follow the President's teachings and establish a first-class nation-building undertaking; inherit the legacy of Ban Gu and Ma Rong and promote the immortal spirit of the ancient sages." Although the couplet was not particularly well-written, seeing it at this time and in this place, and recalling the impressions of the arduous construction of the oil mine these past few days, greatly moved us. The main hall is used as a reception room. On the walls are inscriptions by Yuan Suxin, Zhao Fengqi, and others, as well as the names of the Eight Views of Chijin: "Camel Bells Startle Dreams," "Flute Playing in the Evening," "Qilian Mountain's Remaining Snow," "Gobi Light Smoke," "White Pagoda Wild Geese," "Ancient Buddha Secluded Rock," "Red Mountain Stone Pot," and "Golden Bull Clear Water." Except for the Golden Bull and Stone Pot, which have been lost and cannot be verified, since this place was a major postal station on the Tang Dynasty route, the remaining scenes are not difficult to imagine, as will be discussed below regarding "Ancient Buddha Secluded Rock." After I had visited the statues in Dunhuang, I realized that the Tang Dynasty statues sculpted in Hongshan Temple were relatively complete. As mentioned earlier, Hongshan Temple is built against the mountain, and includes Hongshan Temple, Biyun Cave, Zixia Cave, Guanyin Rock, and Kui Xing Tower. The buildings are towering, and the pagodas are soaring. According to the inscription on a stele in the temple from the fifth year of the Guangxu reign (1879), the original temple had an iron plaque inscribed with "Guangzhao Daqian" (Illuminating the Universe) by Yuchi Jingde from the Zhenguan era of the Tang Dynasty, indicating that the temple was likely built in the Tang Dynasty. However, later, in the second year of the Tongzhi reign of the Qing Dynasty (1863), it suffered from the Hui rebellion, and the postal pavilions, residences, and houses were all reduced to ashes. The temple was also destroyed by fire, and the iron plaque was naturally lost. The current temple was rebuilt in the fifth year of the Guangxu reign. The walls and statues in each temple are very crude. Among them, only the Buddha statues in Guanyin Rock Cave are relatively complete. Because they were carved into the cave, it is possible that the entrance of the cave was sealed off when the entire Hongshan Temple was destroyed, leaving it preserved. There is insufficient light and dry air inside. The five bodhisattvas, sitting or standing, and the two fierce-looking Dharma protectors, have superior structures and curves. In particular, the facial expressions, some kind and gentle, some with lowered eyebrows and silent sitting, are expressed even in their fingers. While savoring the melancholic and ancient mood of "Camel Bells Startle Dreams," we had lunch. It had started to rain. The colleagues at the farm advised us to stay here and listen to the camel bells late at night, but we were eager to get to Yumen or Anxi, so we thanked them for their kindness and set off in the rain at 1:45 in the afternoon. The entire Chijin Fort was shrouded in a misty drizzle, with bright and lively colors. Currently, there are only over two thousand households, diligently cultivating the land in the oasis in the desert, dreaming long and ancient dreams...</p>

<h3>General Commodity Prices - Rise Slowly Across the Board - Overall Trend Remains Stable</h3>
<p>Following the weak trend at the end of the previous period, commodity prices last week opened at the beginning of the week, due to a flurry of negative news, with most commodities hovering at stable levels. Subsequently, because the negative news could not be confirmed and market credit was loose, commodity prices showed a slow upward trend. Generally speaking, the trend remained stable. Among the classified items, food and building materials fell back, while textiles, chemicals, fuels, and metals rose. The general wholesale price index compiled by this publication was 4,740.348 times, an increase of 2.01% compared to the previous week. Credit generally showed signs of looseness and excess. The National Bank's exchanges repeatedly showed deficits, and underground interest rates were around 50-60 cents.</p>
<p>The government's economic measures last week, which have a relatively close relationship with future commodity prices, include the following:</p>
<p>First, since the government issued emergency economic measures in February of last year, prohibiting the trading of gold ornaments, more than a year has passed. During this time, the country's economic situation has not improved, and black market trading of gold has never disappeared. Recently, the Shanghai authorities approved the industry's request to resume trading in gold ornaments on a trial basis before formal approval from the Executive Yuan. The price is calculated according to the market price of the foreign exchange settlement certificate plus the base price of the US dollar, converting each tael of gold to US$40 according to the legal ratio between the US dollar and gold, plus a legal profit of 20%, operating expenses of 40%, and wages of 50%. According to this calculation, on Monday, the purchase price of each tael of gold ornaments was 320 million yuan, and the selling price was 360 million yuan.</p>
<p>According to the chairman of the industry association, in order to avoid social misperceptions that might stimulate commodity prices, they are adopting a cautious approach to exchanging gold ornaments. There are conflicting opinions regarding the advantages and disadvantages of opening up gold ornament trading. This publication does not intend to predict its future here. We will let the readers judge for themselves.</p>
<p>Second, the case of opening up self-provided foreign exchange is approaching the implementation stage. Huo Baoshu, the chairman of the Import and Export Control Committee, hosted importers, exporters, and the press on Thursday, reporting the main points as follows:</p>
<p>The Executive Yuan, at its eighth meeting on the 21st of this month, passed the "Measures for Overseas Chinese Capital and Domestic Capital Investing in Domestic Production Enterprises," which has been published in newspapers. We can briefly explain its spirit:</p>
<p>(1) Supplementing Production Equipment: Over the past ten years, domestic production enterprises have suffered repeated damage and urgently need to be supplemented and restored. During the war, many domestic factories ordered machines from abroad, which now urgently need to be imported. Overseas Chinese who hope to invest in domestic production enterprises should be given convenience.</p>
<p>(2) Supplementing Production Raw Materials: Article 8 of these measures stipulates that investment is allowed to bring back the main raw materials needed domestically. The list of raw materials is shown in the attached table. These raw materials are lacking domestically and are not included in US aid, while the places where overseas Chinese reside are the main production areas.</p>
<p>(3) Coordinating with Domestic Industrial Needs: The raw materials listed in the currently announced appendix are all extremely lacking domestically. In the future, the announcement will still be coordinated with industrial needs. If domestic supply is sufficient, imports will not be allowed; if there is a shortage, supplementation will be provided.</p>
<p>(4) The Quota System Remains in Place: The purpose of these measures is to supplement the shortage of industrial raw materials. Because domestic raw materials are extremely lacking, the quota system remains in place.</p>
<p>We feel that the severity of the current commodity price problem is indeed due to insufficient production, which is a very important reason. However, insufficient production stems from a lack of raw materials. Therefore, the authorities' measures are an improvement targeted at the facts. However, there are still many unnecessary controls in place. We hope that the authorities will work hard to eliminate them one by one.</p>
<p>Third, regarding the establishment of the Economic Control Bureau, this publication has previously reported that this was discussed at the meeting convened by the President on Mogan Mountain. Whether or not it will be established seems to still be under consideration. This case is of particular concern to the industrial and commercial circles in Shanghai.</p>
<p>Fourth, the Shanghai Financial Management Bureau found that the China Industrial and Mining Bank in this city had set up secret accounts, established separate business names, and engaged in commercial activities by misappropriating bank funds. It specially requested and obtained approval from the Ministry of Finance to order the bank to suspend operations from the 29th. At the same time, the Hankou branch of the bank was also ordered by the Financial Management Bureau to suspend operations immediately because it committed the same offenses. The detailed situation of this case has not yet been publicly announced by the Financial Management Bureau, but this is undoubtedly a major event since the establishment of the Financial Management Bureau.</p>
<p>The trend in the commodity market last week was due to the mutual control of both the bulls and the bears. Except for yarn and cloth, which hit a new high on Friday, most commodities saw ups and downs, but the fluctuations were not large. In terms of food, prices fell slightly due to ample arrivals and sluggish sales. For example, top-quality white japonica rice fell from 40 million at the beginning of the week to 36-37 million on Friday. However, at the weekend, stimulated by the increased price of rationed rice, prices immediately rose, with white japonica rice reaching 43 million. Oil and flour prices rose slowly because the channels were still good. For example, at the end of the week, Qingdao Ji Tong raw oil stood at 11.8 million, and Bingshan No. 1 flour stood at 11.15 million.</p>
<p>In the yarn and cloth market, prices rose considerably due to the temporary suspension of allocation by the Yarn Management Committee and the loose credit situation. On Friday, a new record was set, with 42-count Blue Phoenix standing at 21.6 million, 21-count Double Horse standing at 17.7 million, and Dragon Head fine cloth standing at 5.7 million. Daily necessities such as soap and firecrackers mostly recovered after a period of weakness. Among other items, metals rose by more than 10%, while the rest remained stable.</p>

<h3>Currency and Finance</h3>
<p>(1) Credit and Underground Interest Rates</p>
<p>The trend of credit in this city had already turned loose at the end of the previous week. As expected, credit last week became even more relaxed across the board. The amount of funds in the market is also governed by the principle of supply and demand. To summarize the reasons for the relaxation of credit last week, they are as follows:</p>
<p>(1) In the past half month, there have been many rumors about the political situation. The business community is the most sensitive. This has created a situation where sellers are eager to sell and buyers are waiting and watching. Since general commodity prices have not seen a sharp rise due to the issuance of large banknotes, the demand for funds is not as urgent as in the past. This can be said to be a demand-side factor determining the relaxation of credit.</p>
<p>(2) As for the supply side, not only has there been a continuous influx of remittances from other places, but state-owned banks and bureaus have been making every effort to purchase goods from the public during this period of low prices. For example, the Central Farmers Bank paid out 3 trillion yuan for flour in six days. With huge government expenditures, state-owned banks and bureaus have largely reported deficits this week. Funds are not only being supplied from all sides, but also the supply is greater than the demand, so credit is naturally becoming more relaxed day by day.</p>
<p>Commercial banks and firms have been very flexible in deploying funds. Many in the industry are generally long on orders, and some even deposit orders with the Central Bank for cash to be withdrawn the next day. Therefore, interbank lending has been unusually sparse this week. According to the clearing results of banks and firms after the 60th, if the deficit of 2.5412 trillion yuan of the Bank of Taiwan on Thursday and Friday is not counted, the actual deficit from Monday to Friday is only 1.4833 trillion yuan, a decrease of more than 4.87 billion yuan compared to the same period last week.</p>
<p>The underground interest rate in the market last week was generally around 50 cents, which is obviously lower than the daily interest rate of more than 70 cents last week. On Thursday, there was an excess of funds, with interest rates as low as 36 cents. On Friday, the underground interest rate continued to fall below 40 cents, which is rare in recent times. As for cash chips, although the supply has become stronger due to the issuance of large banknotes, because of the severe cash shortage in various places, many have flowed out, resulting in a discount on large banknotes.</p>
<p>State-owned banks and bureaus, with expenditures such as purchasing goods, foreign exchange settlement certificates, and disbursing European funds, had a total deficit of 2.4505 trillion yuan from Monday to Friday, an increase of more than 3.19 billion yuan compared to the same period last week.</p>
<p>Although the foreign exchange intake of foreign banks last week was not as large as the previous week due to the intake of foreign exchange settlement certificates, there was still a surplus of 3.2638 trillion yuan from Monday to Friday, a decrease of 4.3409 trillion yuan compared to the previous week. This also played a considerable role in the overall relaxation of credit last week.</p>
<p>(2) Domestic and Foreign Exchange Rates</p>
<p>The domestic remittance rates of commercial banks and firms also generally rebounded amid the loosening of credit. The reason for this is that after credit loosened, there were many customer remittances, and banks and firms did not need to attract remittances with low remittance rates.</p>
<p>The reason why the remittance rate in the Huapu district is higher than in the Central and Northern China districts is simply a symbol of the continued flight of capital to the south. The remittance rate to Guangzhou was 250 yuan on Monday and Tuesday. Although it fell by 20 yuan on Wednesday, it rose to 300 yuan on Thursday. Friday was the same as Thursday.</p>
<p>The remittance rate to Xiamen remained high at 400 yuan from Monday to Friday. The remittance rate to Chongqing was at par before Tuesday, changed to 70 yuan on Wednesday, and rose sharply to 150 yuan on Thursday. On Friday, it rose again to 200 yuan.</p>
<p>The remittance rate to Tianjin was at a discount of 20 yuan before Wednesday, and rose to par on Thursday and Friday, indicating that there were fewer floating funds coming to Shanghai from the north than before. The foreign exchange market last week still saw a sluggish trend in foreign exchange settlement certificates, with transaction prices generally between 3.8 million and 3.85 million. Although gold ornaments are now openly traded in jewelry stores, because the Central Bank is not responsible for supplying gold bars or ingots, the outflow of gold ornaments is greater than the inflow after the opening of business, and the trading situation is quite sluggish.</p>
<p>The Shanghai-Hong Kong remittance rate was slightly longer in the first half of the week, with 100,000 legal tender equal to 9 Hong Kong cents, but it shortened to 8 cents on Thursday. The market price of US dollars in Hong Kong fluctuated between HK$5.40 and HK$5.42 from Monday to Thursday. The price of gold per Chinese tael was high on Wednesday, reaching HK$335.50, but was only HK$327.50 on Monday, and fell again to HK$331 on Thursday.</p>
<p>(3) Chinese and Foreign Stock Markets</p>
<p>The Chinese stock market opened weakly at the beginning of the week. After the previous weekend's sharp decline, it saw a slight recovery, but soon weakened again. In the afternoon, due to the stable prices of external commodities and the longer Hong Kong exchange rate, people's confidence was weak, and prices fell sharply, a rare situation in recent weeks. Yong Yarn once fell to the limit, eventually closing at a low price of 9,850 yuan. Except for five stocks such as Xinyi and Zhongfa, all others fell across the board. The next day, due to loose credit, stable external conditions, and the inevitability of reversal after extreme conditions, people's confidence recovered, and various stocks turned from weak to strong, with many hitting the limit. Yong Yarn closed at the upper limit of 10,835 yuan.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, due to reports of rising prices of commodities outside the stock market and the imminent reality of opening up self-provided foreign exchange, there were hopes for industrial and commercial prosperity. Although there were ups and downs due to fierce battles between bulls and bears, the results were consistent gains. Yong Yarn rose by 650 yuan, and Jinglun and Zhongfa both hit the limit. Other stocks rose by half a percent to nearly 20%. On Thursday, news of the suspension of exchange at the China Industrial and Mining Bank dampened enthusiasm. There was selling at high prices, and the process was erratic. As a result, Yong Yarn rose by 120 yuan, closing at 11,570 yuan. Yongye and Lianhua both hit the limit, Xinhe and seven others gained, and the rest turned weak.</p>
<p>On Friday, due to the loose credit situation, buying interest was strong, and market sentiment was soaring. Many entered the upper limit. However, due to concerns among buyers, there was profit-taking and selling. For example, Yong Yarn broke the limit after entering the upper limit several times. As a result, except for Zhongfa, which fell alone, all others rose. Yong Yarn closed at 12,600 yuan, and Rongfeng and Lianhua both hit the limit. Other stocks rose by varying percentages.</p>
<p>At the weekend, due to the President's visit to Shanghai, people's confidence was shaken, and various parties sold off. Except for five stocks such as Tongyi, Hengfeng, Wuhe, Yonggong, and Merlin, which gained slightly, most other stocks showed a slight downward trend.</p>

<p>According to a dispatch from the United Press in Nanjing on July 27th, authoritative sources revealed that the Executive Yuan has, in principle, approved two major changes to China's foreign exchange control policy: First, allowing importers to use their own foreign exchange to import production equipment and raw materials; Second, allowing overseas Chinese to remit money back to the country by importing goods.</p>
<p>Indeed, on the 28th of last month, the Executive Yuan officially announced the full text of the measures for overseas Chinese capital and domestic residents with overseas deposits to apply for importing investment in production enterprises. Subsequently, the Shanghai Import Management Committee also formally announced the detailed implementation rules of the measures on the 29th.</p>
<p>According to the measures announced by the Executive Yuan, it is understood that self-provided foreign exchange and overseas Chinese capital, under the relevant regulations of the authorities, can be used to import production equipment and raw materials needed by production enterprises. The so-called production enterprises here are defined as those engaged in industry, mining, agriculture, forestry, fisheries, water conservancy, public utilities, transportation, agricultural product processing and export, and handicrafts.</p>
<p>Not only that, but the measures also explicitly stipulate that the expansion and establishment of such production enterprises must meet two prerequisites: First, the enterprise must be truly needed by the country or able to increase exports; Second, more than half of the main raw materials needed for the enterprise must be available domestically. As for the import of production raw materials, the measures stipulate that they are limited to those that are lacking domestically and not covered by U.S. aid. It is worth noting that Article 7 of the measures strictly prohibits the transfer of imported materials to others, but Article 8 opens up avenues for the resale of such imported materials. One avenue is to sell them directly to production enterprises that need the materials with the approval of the Import Management Committee, and the other is to entrust designated government agencies to sell them on their behalf.</p>
<p>From this, it is not difficult to see that the government wants to use this method to attract the import of materials that are not included in U.S. aid, and ultimately to control them.</p>
<p>As for whether the measures can achieve the goal of supporting the development of production enterprises, it must be understood from the recent trends in the business and industrial sectors.</p>
<p>First, regarding the so-called public utilities, one of the production enterprises recognized by the new measures, last Tuesday, the Municipal Government held a discussion meeting to save the public utility crisis. At the meeting, each public utility company submitted written reports detailing the financial difficulties of each company.</p>
<p>It is reported that the Shanghai Electric Power Company lost more than 30 billion in June and an estimated 20 billion in July. The British-owned Shanghai Water Company lost a total of more than 1.4 trillion from December 31, 1937, to July of this year; the Shanghai Gas Company is expected to lose more than 200 billion in July; other companies such as the Telephone Company, the French-owned Tram and Electric Light Company, and the Public Transportation Company have all suffered losses of hundreds of billions of yuan or more in recent months. In such a situation, it is difficult to be optimistic about whether public utilities can expand their equipment and operations.</p>
<p>Secondly, regarding the textile industry, not only are raw materials difficult to obtain, but also exports are difficult to develop. According to news from the Economic Information Agency, China Textile Corporation currently has only more than 110,000 piculs of cotton stored in the mainland, and transportation is extremely difficult. From last year to this year, the Flower, Yarn, and Cloth Management Committee originally planned to collect 2 million piculs of cotton, but only received 500,000 piculs. The situation this year is said to be even less optimistic. Speaking of Indian cotton, one of the sources of raw cotton, prices have also risen recently, with cotton of 13/16 inch length rising to more than 1,100 rupees per pound.</p>
<p>Regarding domestic purchasing work, the General Manager of the Textile Construction Company stated that since the occurrence of silver dollar transactions in various places, the purchasing situation has been greatly hindered. In addition, the lack of coal and electricity, the spread of war, and the huge military demand have made it difficult for even the Textile Construction Company to maintain its operations.</p>
<p>As for exports, the threat of competition from Japanese goods can be said to be increasing day by day. According to a report from the Central News Agency last Monday, from the surrender of Japan to the end of June this year, textiles worth several billion Japanese yen have been exported, including 514 million yards of cotton cloth. The export of textiles has become the leading export of Japan.</p>
<p>The New York Foreign Trade Office of the Supreme Commander for the Allied Powers in Japan recently announced the sale of 13 types of Japanese cotton fabrics at reduced prices. According to Nagai, the Director of the Japanese Trade Bureau, this year's private trade in Japan has doubled compared to last year. Under the multiple blows, many cotton textile factories have moved south to Hong Kong, so the so-called encouragement of overseas Chinese capital to return to the country for construction is even more difficult to predict. Furthermore, regarding the shipping industry, not only have operating costs increased sharply and become disconnected from freight rates, but Chinese ships can only carry 25% of U.S. aid materials. Whether the ports of the Yangtze River and Beijing-Hankou will be opened has also become a mystery. Recently, Japanese ships have even gone to Taiwan to transport sugar and to Qinhuangdao to transport coal, resulting in significant losses of private shipping rights, and the shipping industry feels unable to maintain its operations. After the import of overseas Chinese capital materials under government control, whether it can increase the supply of coal, diesel, and oil needed by the shipping industry, and even expand its equipment, can only be proven by events.</p>
<p>This publication has previously summarized the crisis in the business and industrial sectors. It is difficult to predict whether this partial relaxation of the self-provided foreign exchange measures can save the business and industrial crisis to any extent. However, the recent Hong Kong "Far Eastern Economic Review" published an article discussing the flight of Chinese hot money to Hong Kong, which is worth learning from. According to the author of the article, the total amount of deposits in Hong Kong banks is approximately 1.5 billion Hong Kong dollars, equivalent to 350 million U.S. dollars. The article believes that the flight of hot money to Hong Kong began in 1937, and after the war, due to the deterioration of the economic situation and national instability, capital flight continued. The conclusion is that if the legal tender continues to depreciate, the flight of hot money cannot be stopped by any restrictions or propaganda. Therefore, the fundamental solution to this evil is to stop the printing of paper money at home and abroad. From this, it is not difficult to see the fundamental crux of China's current problems. As for the effectiveness of the measure to encourage the import of overseas Chinese capital, the evaluation of the import and export industry in Shanghai is quite noteworthy. People in the industry believe that the partial relaxation of self-provided foreign exchange is indeed a good way to attract overseas Chinese capital, but they hope that the domestic situation can improve day by day, and that the government can seek more practical ways to maintain business and industry. Only then can overseas hot money be attracted, otherwise, if, as in previous months, some domestic yarn factories still plan to set up factories in Hong Kong with purchased equipment, this trend is still worrying.</p>
<p>Indeed, whether the new measures can succeed will naturally have to undergo a severe test by the business and industrial sectors before it can be determined.</p>

<h3>Our National Olympic Football Team to Face Turkey Today, Basketball Team's Second Match Against Belgium</h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] Whether China can perform better in this Olympic Games can be decided today. The Chinese football team will make its first appearance today, meeting the strong opponent Turkey in the first week of competition. Turkey has repeatedly defeated first-class British amateur teams in friendly matches, and its abundant energy and fast tactics are praised by the London sports community as a dark horse with hopes of reaching the finals. After arriving in England, our football team had two unofficial matches with the American team and both were victorious. Coach Li Huitang said that all the athletes are in peak condition and even made a bold statement that they could participate in the finals. The victory or defeat of our football team today is of great concern to the people of the whole country.</p>
<p>The basketball team's second match will be against Belgium this afternoon. In the second group where our country is located, Poland, which ranked fourth in the last Olympic Games, was originally designated as the seed team, but because Poland did not register, the Philippines, which ranked fifth, was substituted. The other five teams are China, South Korea, Iraq, Chile, and Belgium. It is generally predicted that our country and South Korea are the two teams most likely to win second place. Unexpectedly, our country suffered an unfortunate defeat to Chile in the first match, which cast a shadow on our country's prospects for entering the final eight. Belgium recently met South Korea and lost by only two points, while South Korea's defeat to the seed Philippines was only by one point. From this, it can be inferred that Belgium's strength is also not weak. In today's match, our athletes still need to work hard. Li Shiqiao, the main player of our basketball team, is expected to arrive in London from Singapore yesterday to participate in today's competition.</p>

<h3>Anthropology at Jinan University</h3>
<p>— Xu Di</p>
<p>I. Anthropology</p>
<p>As the name suggests, anthropology is the science of studying human beings themselves. To understand the origin of mankind, to understand its characteristics, to recognize the trend of culture, and to promote human peace and happiness, we need to study anthropology. The scope of anthropology is extremely broad, including all human activities in time and space, from natural sciences to social sciences, so its content is extraordinarily broad, and its relationship with us is particularly close. Therefore, in advanced countries in Europe and the United States, anthropology has long become a very important science, and efforts are made to promote research.</p>
<p>II. The Birth of the Department of Anthropology</p>
<p>When the miracle of the discovery of "Peking Man" shocked the world, anthropology also once attracted people's attention, but good times did not last, and the voice of researching anthropology remained silent. During the Anti-Japanese War, academic work was greatly hindered, and anthropology naturally had no hope of development. It was not until the arrival of victory that people in the society and government authorities realized that this science really needed to be established as soon as possible due to the importance of anthropology itself and the actual needs expressed in various aspects at that time. Therefore, the Ministry of Education decided to add a Department of Anthropology at the National Jinan University in Shanghai first when adjusting the departments of various universities and colleges at the beginning of the restoration, and China's first Department of Anthropology was born at Jinan University in the autumn of the 35th year. Why did the Ministry of Education first pay attention to establishing a Department of Anthropology at Jinan University? This has another meaning. Jinan University originally had the mission of overseas Chinese education, and the place where overseas Chinese in Southeast Asia live is a holy place for studying anthropology and ethnology (an important branch of anthropology). The establishment of this department at Jinan University naturally has more practical significance. Overseas Chinese are scattered in various parts of Southeast Asia and have frequent contact with the local indigenous peoples. If they can have extensive knowledge in various aspects of anthropology and ethnology, they will be of great benefit to the entire cultural exchange and personal career. From the perspective of academic research, there is also the convenience and achievement of taking materials locally and giving full play to effectiveness. Therefore, not only overseas Chinese have the need to study anthropology, but all those who aspire to work in Southeast Asia cannot ignore it.</p>
<p>III. A New Garden for Teaching and Research</p>
<p>The Department of Anthropology at Jinan University has only been in operation for two years, so it is naturally far from the ideal state. However, the achievements shown in these short two years are commendable. Everything is the result of human effort and struggle in an unstable life and economic difficulties. When you see the teachers and students' tireless spirit of studying, you can see that its future has been fully guaranteed. Professor Liu Xian, the head of the department, is a practical scholar who specialized in anthropology at Oxford University in England in his early years. He has extensive knowledge in various departments of anthropology, has received strict training, and has published many special research papers, earning a master's degree. He has represented China twice in the International Congress of Anthropological and Ethnological Sciences in Lisbon and Paris and was appointed as a permanent director of the Chinese Committee of the London International Congress of Anthropological and Ethnological Sciences. After returning to China, he has been engaged in lecturing and various academic work for many years and has achieved remarkable results. In the 23rd year, he led a team to Hainan Island to investigate the Li ethnic group, delving into the Li villages, climbing to the top of Wuzhi Mountain, and collecting many specimens. He has published many papers on the study of the Li ethnic group and is one of the authorities in the Chinese anthropological community. When Jinan University was restored and the Department of Anthropology was established, Professor Liu was hired as the head of the department (and also served as the dean of the College of Science). He is dedicated to teaching, patient and encouraging, and spares no effort in supporting younger scholars. The progress of the Department of Anthropology at Jinan University under his leadership is truly remarkable. As for the faculty, it can be described as complete and strong: Professor Wu Shihua, Professor of Physical Anthropology, is a domestic authority in this field and enjoys a high reputation. Professor Xue Zhongdong, Professor of Human Genetics, is an expert in this field and has been teaching for many years. Professor Lu Yudao, who teaches psychology, and Professor Ying Chengyi, who teaches sociology, are all authoritative scholars and well-known figures in their respective disciplines in China and need no introduction. The department is currently in negotiations to hire Professor Esther, a world-renowned anthropologist from Germany, to come to China to lecture, which will have a profound impact on the development of this discipline in our country. In terms of equipment, due to funding constraints, books and instruments are purchased in stages, but the folklore specimen exhibition room that the department has already established is already of considerable scale and extremely valuable. It contains more than 800 folklore specimens, mainly more than 400 daily necessities and artworks of the Gaoshan ethnic group in Taiwan and more than 300 of the Li ethnic group in Hainan Island, which are very valuable cultural materials and are rare in China. Whenever scholars from home and abroad visit this new garden of Chinese anthropology, they express surprise and praise. - Indeed, it is not easy to have such performance in such a short period of time.</p>
<p>IV. Keen Expectations Here is a brief introduction to the outline of the Department of Anthropology at Jinan University, which is a faithful report without intention to exaggerate. It is hoped that it can arouse the attention of Chinese people to anthropology, especially young students who aspire to further study and who are taking college entrance exams, to have some understanding of the discipline and know what to choose. Anthropology is an emerging science that is of great importance to the future of mankind. In our country, it is still virgin land, and its future development is unlimited. Foresight and long-term vision, where to go and what to do, is up to the scholars.</p>

<h3>Fake US Dollars in Shanghai</h3>
<p>— Yu Chuang</p>
<p>It can be said that the Shanghai police authorities have severely punished the unscrupulous merchants who illegally trade in black market gold and foreign currency, but driven by profit, there is always a group of people who are willing to take risks and continue to engage in this illegal business. Just looking at the fact that gold and foreign currency cases are still being heard from time to time, it can be seen that this type of transaction has not yet disappeared. However, since trading in gold and foreign currency has become an illegal secret transaction, countless unscrupulous villains have taken the opportunity to muddy the waters, so that even if the victims know they have been deceived, they cannot speak out and can only "eat huanglian (a bitter Chinese herb) like a mute, unable to express their suffering." These villains' methods are much more vicious than the petty hucksters of the so-called gold and foreign currency brokers. For example, some time ago, it was rumored that someone melted gold bars and re-minted gold bars with insufficient purity and sold them on the black market, and the authorities had already arrested people related to this matter. It is expected that after the court hearing, the truth will be revealed. However, among the US dollars circulating on the Shanghai black market, there are also a large number of fake banknotes, which are extremely well-made and can almost be mistaken for real - but I am afraid that many people do not know this?</p>
<p>The American magazine "World Report," published last month, published a Shanghai dispatch reporting the news of these fake banknotes. According to that reporter, J.F. (probably Joseph Fromm, the magazine's special correspondent to Japan and the Far East), the fake US dollars in Shanghai were first discovered two years ago, with denominations of $50 and $20, but they have reappeared in large quantities since May of this year.</p>
<p>Initially, an employee of an American bank in Shanghai suddenly saw a $50 banknote that looked fake when counting banknotes, so he set it aside. Later, the bank's authorities sent the banknote to the bank's head office in the United States for identification. After a few days, the head office replied, returning the original, saying that the banknote was real. However, the employee who counted the banknotes was a very "stubborn" person, and he looked at the banknote carefully again and said that it must be fake. The bank's authorities respected the opinion of their employee very much and sent the banknote to the Federal Reserve Bank (equivalent to the central bank in our country) for identification. The reply came back, also saying that it was real, and the person responsible for the identification even signed his name personally to prove that the banknote was reliable.</p>
<p>However, the employee was still not "convinced," and the bank's authorities, seeing his integrity and incorruptibility, were very impressed and tried again. This time, it was formally submitted to the US Treasury Department. The Treasury Department attached great importance to this matter and sent it to a specially established laboratory for careful research. After a rather complex analysis, it was proven that the banknote was indeed fake!</p>
<p>The person in charge of the Treasury Department's laboratory said that this type of fake banknote is indeed the most technically advanced type of forgery. Not only would laymen be deceived, but even some people who are specifically responsible for identifying fake banknotes would think that it came from the US government's printing press. These two types of fake banknotes (one $50 and one $20) use different paper, so everyone suspects that these two types of banknotes come from two different sources. Some people speculate that the engraving machine may have come from Germany. After the end of the European war, the US military discovered a large number of engraving experts in Nazi concentration camps. Although they were detained, they were treated quite well by the Nazis. Their main task was to specialize in counterfeiting banknotes from Britain and the United States. The fake gold pound notes they made were actually sent to the Bank of England (the British national bank) without any problems, and no one suspected that they were fake banknotes!</p>
<p>Therefore, some people think that perhaps this batch of plates or fake banknotes was smuggled out of Germany by bandits and arrived in Shanghai. There is also another report that Japan once counterfeited a large amount of US dollars, totaling as much as 100 million US dollars, but the Japanese denied that such a thing had ever happened.</p>
<p>According to that reporter, the US military authorities in Shanghai are making every effort to track down the bandits, but although there are many informants, no one can provide concrete evidence. And in the American commercial banks in Shanghai, these fake banknotes are still appearing in an endless stream.</p>
<p>However, I think that these fake banknotes that go to American commercial banks must only be a small minority of the total. Isn't the black market for gold and foreign currency the most ideal "battleground" for fake banknotes?</p>
<h3>New Art of Ejection</h3>
<p>— Yuan Yi</p>
<p>Many prosperous restaurants in the United States, because customers often like to linger after meals, which affects business, have now begun to use a new device; when customers sit down on the chair in front of the counter, the counter and the chair slowly rotate to the left together. After turning a few feet, a waitress standing behind the moving counter will serve a dish. The turning continues endlessly, and the dishes are served one by one according to a certain time. If you don't have time to eat, you have to sacrifice. When the last dish is finished, the counter and the customer's chair have turned to the end. At this time, the customer must leave immediately. If he wants to stay and chat, he will inevitably be surprised - it turns out that the chair he is sitting on has turned to this place, and it will naturally fall to the floor below!</p>
<h3>Overcoming the Fear of Water</h3>
<p>— Mao Yi</p>
<p>It's the season for mermaids to show off their skills again. But despite the beaches and swimming pools being crowded with people, their numbers are still small compared to the total population. Why is this happening? Frank Dalton, a famous American swimming coach, said it best: "Three-fifths of Americans don't know how to swim... Most of them don't know how to swim and don't want to know—just because they are afraid of water."</p>
<p>As a result of people being afraid of water and refusing to learn to swim, many drowning deaths occur every year. Most of these unfortunate victims are not unable to escape on their own. Swimming experts agree that no matter how acute and profound a person's fear of water is, there is a cure.</p>
<p>There are two simple steps in the process of treating this condition: first, understand the cause of the fear; second, overcome it. An adult's difficulty may be due to his or her personal fear or a childhood fear. In either case, he or she must first find a particular accident or other root cause that makes him or her treat water as an enemy.</p>
<p>The reason for being afraid of water may be very simple, for example, accidentally slipping from the mother's hands into the bathtub while taking a bath as a child, causing pain, and from then on refusing to take a bath, let alone swim.</p>
<p>After knowing the reason why a person is afraid of water, one can prescribe the right medicine. Therefore, a swimming coach should understand psychology, because fear of water is a psychological condition rather than a physiological one. "Fear of water" is usually not difficult to cure. Many adult "patients" have long forgotten the cause of their fear of water, but due to the machinations of the subconscious, they have always been afraid to approach water. For this kind of "patient," the coach or doctor should "get to the root" of the questioning and try to evoke his memory. Once the original cause is traced, he will often smile knowingly, laughing at his past timidity and childishness, and will no longer be afraid of water.</p>
<p>Of course, "fear of water," like other psychological conditions, requires individual treatment depending on the individual symptoms and cannot be treated like diphtheria with a general injection of serum.</p>
<p>Explanation and guidance are the two major elixirs for treating "fear of water." Often accompany a person who is unwilling or unwilling to swim to the swimming place to visit, and at the same time provoke and encourage him or her in words and actions - but do not force him or her - soon he or she will be eager to try and automatically go into the water.</p>
<h3>Leling Jujubes</h3>
<p>— Zhu Ying</p>
<p>Leling jujubes are one of the specialties of Shandong Province and have long enjoyed a high reputation. They are crimson in color and as large as cherries, hence the name Leling Small Jujubes. They have a sweet and mellow taste and small, soft pits. Travelers to the area are eager to taste them first.</p>
<p>The trees bloom in the fourth month of the lunar calendar, with yellow and tiny flowers that smell like roses. During the flowering season, bees gather on the trees all night long. The leaves are oval, alternate, and resemble locust leaves, but slightly smaller.</p>
<p>The flowers grow under the leaves, and a flower grows every other leaf. Fruiting is very vigorous. The trees are about ten feet tall, with gnarled branches and trunks. The wood is strong and heavy and is often used for carving book blocks or making axles. It has a wide range of uses.</p>
<p>The northeastern countryside of Leling has abundant jujube forests, which farmers regard as a treasure. Their livelihood for the year depends on the harvest of these jujube forests.</p>
<p>Trees bear the most and best fruit for about ten years, and the taste is also the sweetest. Over time, the yield gradually decreases, the trees gradually wither, and the wood is not as strong and beautiful as before. After that, they no longer bear fruit.</p>
<p>In May and June, the fruits gradually become solid. It is said that on the Dragon Boat Festival in May, small jujubes are used to plug noses, which refers to the size of the jujubes. However, the color is green, and they have no taste when eaten. After the White Dew Festival, they turn red, as the saying goes, "There are no green jujubes after the White Dew." The trees are dotted with red spots like cherries. When picking jujubes, bamboo mats are first laid on the ground to prevent mud from soiling them, and then bamboo poles are used to strike the trees. Thousands of poles fall together, like a sudden rain. Before long, the ground can be covered with a layer of more than a foot thick. However, jujubes are easily spoiled when injured by falling to the ground, so only locals or nearby people can taste the fresh jujubes. Those sold to other places are mostly dried jujubes.</p>
<p>Hedgehogs are good at stealing jujubes, and monkeys climb to the tops of trees to pick jujubes and drop them to the ground. Then they climb down the tree, gather the jujubes together, roll over, stick the thorns onto their bodies, and carry them back to their nests for use in winter. Farmers often tie grass under the trees to make figures, dressed in straw hats and holding bows and arrows, as if guarding. The hedgehogs, mistaking them for humans, dare not approach.</p>
<h3>Little Raindrops</h3>
<p>— Shi Jimei</p>
<p>The human heart is a wondrous thing; in that square inch of space, it holds countless treasures and rubbish, blossoming flowers and rootless weeds, palaces of gods and territories of devils…</p>
<p>Being cared for and caring for others are both beautiful things, but the former is a joyful enjoyment, while the latter is a painful enjoyment.</p>
<p>A justified hatred is more valuable than a nameless love.</p>
<p>Successful people are not necessarily great, and great people are not necessarily successful. This is an extremely simple matter, but it's a pity that a class of mediocre people can never understand it.</p>
<p>Discounted eyes always mistake gilded metal for real gold.</p>
<p>The pine trees in the mountains are evergreen, but when people break off their branches and plant them in small purple clay pots, appreciating them like bonsai, nurturing them like flowers in a greenhouse, they wither instead.</p>
<p>Having a good heart without good deeds is like having oil in a lamp but not lighting it.</p>
<h3>Protecting the People</h3>
<p>— Gongsun Wu</p>
<p>Zhu Jia's abridged version of Mencius, "Essentials of Mencius," has been lost. At the end of the Qing Dynasty, Liu Chuanrong began to search for it within Jin Renshan's "Collected Annotations on Mencius by Wang." It was said that he had recovered the original form of this book. Zeng Guofan wrote a preface for it, saying that Liu could only arrange the order, and it was still an incomplete book. I have never liked "Essentials" and "Gist" books, believing they are tools for personal research. If it's for easy reference, it's better to compile an index. Mencius's discussion of benevolent governance focuses on regulating the people's livelihoods. The saying of "hundred acres of land, five acres of homestead" appears five times in his book, suggesting that people's affairs are the most important. The work of sericulture, mulberry planting, chicken and pig farming is the beginning of the kingly way. The meaning of a constant heart and constant livelihood is mentioned twice, which is the foundation of Mencius's political theory. His actions include equally distributing well-field system, rectifying land boundaries, lightening taxes, equalizing grain stipends, reducing punishments, and teaching filial piety and brotherly love. These are his goals. However, Mencius did not speak of democracy or governance by the people. Although there was the saying that "the people are valued, the ruler is light," he knew to respect the people's will. In reality, it didn't exceed the old saying that "the people are the foundation of the state." His discussion of regulating the people's livelihoods was also only for those who win the people's hearts. Two thousand years later, there was Huang Zongxi, who wrote "On the Prince," also not expecting that later generations would have a system of governance by the people. Mencius discussed the concept of "ownership by the people, enjoyment by the people" in great detail. If the passages on winning the people's hearts from the seven books are extracted and arranged into a book, although it would be a fragmentation of the original book, it would be very convenient for beginners. The saying of "protecting the people and reigning as king" can be fully understood at a glance.</p>
<h3>Reporting to Censor Yao Yuanchu in Bai Xia</h3>
<p>— Shi Shufan</p>
<p>A wild and uninhibited spirit of the lake and sea, in the blink of an eye, concerns multiply like threads. How can one forgive the world? It is not easy to speak in office! The fiery dust is chaotic and rampant, a cicada chirps loudly in a quiet alley. One should cherish the bitterness of a loyal heart, irrigate the gardens with dark clouds.</p>
<p>I recall my two or three friends, the royal city is separated by the marketplace building. The unfinished chess game marks more than a brief separation, the ground is firm for a pure and chilling excursion. Unceasing insect chirping sobs, the moon turns and flows with no return, within this sparse and rustic constitution, mountain spirits are entwined with wisteria.</p>
<h3>Reply to Yao Yuanchu, Following the Original Rhyme</h3>
<p>— Sanmu</p>
<p>How can scattered encounters gather and continue past excursions? I am happy enough to be in the lowest ranks with my cup and bowl. As the day ends, old friends still beg for green, a lonely building illuminated by lamplight in the cool night. Fish and dragons in the capital, Luoyang, are originally mostly illusions, the jackals and tigers of the South cannot be allowed to stay. I want to ask you about news, when will the springs and rocks allow us to search together?</p>
<h3>Creation and Inspiration</h3>
<p>— Lianhu</p>
<p>Guo Ruoxu's "Experiences in Painting" records the story of Wu Daozi gaining inspiration from watching General Pei Min's sword dance: "During the Kaiyuan era of the Tang Dynasty, General Pei Min, while in mourning, visited Wu Daozi and requested that he paint several walls with gods and ghosts in the Great Palace Temple of the Eastern Capital to assist his deceased. Daozi replied, 'My painting brush has been neglected for a long time. If the General intends to, dance a sword dance for me, so that I may communicate with the hidden through fierce inspiration.' Min then took off his mourning clothes, dressed as usual, rode his horse like the wind, spun left and turned right, and swung his sword into the clouds, rising several tens of feet, like lightning shooting down, he then used his hand to hold the scabbard to catch the sword, the sword pierced the floor and entered. Thousands of viewers were startled and terrified. Daozi then wielded his drawing brush, a sudden gust of wind arose, creating a magnificent sight for the world. Daozi's painting skills throughout his life were never more inspired than this."</p>
<p>Zhang Xu, a great calligrapher of the Tang Dynasty, often talked about his own experience: "At first, I saw porters arguing over the road and gained insight into the art of calligraphy; later, I saw Lady Gongsun's sword dance and grasped its spirit."</p>
<p>Wang Xizhi observed the posture of geese paddling in the water and derived its meaning for calligraphy.</p>
<p>After Sima Qian traveled extensively through famous mountains and rivers, the momentum of his writing grew increasingly vast and magnificent.</p>
<p>Zhou Meicheng's "Immortal Crane of Auspice" poem and Liu Houcun's "Qinyuan Spring" poem, it is said, were both completed in dreams.</p>
<p>###</p>
<p>The newly appointed President of the Republic of Korea, Dr. Syngman Rhee, I have heard his name, but am not familiar with his deeds. Reading the editorial of this newspaper, I learned that he worked hard for restoration, with perseverance and determination, and achieved success. It can be said that Heaven rewards the diligent.</p>
<p>The history of the Three Hans is very long and closely related to China. The domestic situation, the invasion and insult by Japan, and the oppression of other foreign forces serve as a warning to our country. The Korean people are not lacking in talented and outstanding young heroes. In addition to the organizations and figures listed in the editorial, I also remember two figures who are worth remembering: one is An Jung-geun, and the other is Yun Bong-gil.</p>
<p>In 1909, An Jung-geun assassinated Ito Hirobumi in Harbin, and was arrested on the spot, taken to Tokyo, and martyred for his country. Ito was the Japanese Prime Minister during the Sino-Japanese War, and also the representative for peace talks, forcing Li Hongzhang to sign a humiliating treaty of cession and indemnity. Ten years later, after the Russo-Japanese War, he became the Resident-General in Korea, using Korea as a protectorate, as a prelude to annexation. The Koreans had gritted their teeth for a long time. On the station of Harbin, (Under Russian Police Jurisdiction), he was struck by a bullet and killed. The fate of that illustrious generation of a ruthless hero came to an end. Contemporary commentary compared An to Zhang Liang avenging Korea. However, Zhang Liang's assassination attempt only hit the viceroy's carriage. It was not as good as An's act of killing a strong enemy. The Western press praised him endlessly. The Chinese literary world published a special book, "An Jung-geun," for him. Zheng Yuan of Changsha (the third-place winner in the imperial examination in 1894) inscribed the title, and Liang Rengong wrote "Autumn Wind Cutting Vine Song," published in the "National Customs Report," expressing grief and indignation. Furthermore, the "Bian Qun" magazine had a poem with the signature "Hui Xing" (it is said to be Qian Jun of Yanghu) made a satirical New Yuefu police sentence: "If this revenge is not avenged, I will not live. May Heaven and Earth witness this sincerity. The executioner's dagger gradually plays the zhu, if one strike does not succeed, there will be thousands of years of weeping. It is not as good as this gentleman's good hand, slaughtering the enemy as if slaughtering a dog. A bullet flies out, hitting the heart directly, a clap of thunder shocks the world. Alas, your country has hundreds of millions of people, will there be people rising up later?" Indeed, twenty years later, there was Mr. Yun Bong-gil.</p>
<p>The event took place in 1932, closely following "1918." The "January 28th Incident" ensued, and the Japanese bandits once again staged their "signature trick" in Shanghai, turning the great prosperity of China into ruins. On April 29th, from early morning to noon, Japanese generals, officers, and officials held a celebration meeting in Hongkou Park. Just as their national anthem was being played, Yun Bong-gil suddenly threw a bomb onto the stage from behind the platform. As a result, generals and important figures, such as Shirakawa, Nomura, Ueda, Shigemitsu, Murai, and Kawabata, were either killed or injured, almost wiping out all the demons in one fell swoop. It was truly avenging and righting the wrongs for the people of Shanghai who had suffered destruction, without implicating the Chinese side. This is his great heroic and chivalrous spirit, even surpassing that of Mr. An in the past.</p>
