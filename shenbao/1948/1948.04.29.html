<h3>国大举行第四次投票副總統今日可選出李孫兩氏全力爭取選票</h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿八日電〕副總統選舉廿九日午殆可獲得最後結果，候選人六人經三次票選後，現僅有李宗仁，孫科二人參加廿九日之第四次選舉。此次選舉將以得票較多者爲當選人，不必計其是否超過半數，除非二人票數相同，當再舉行第五次選舉，否則即可決定勝利誰屬。國大主席團廿八日晚舉行第四十一次會議，張振鷺主席，決定廿九日上午舉行第四次選舉副總統大會，推于代表斌任大會主席，副總統選票已於廿八日下午印就，票式與過去相同，此次係白紙紅字，上列副總統候選人李宗仁，孫科姓名，廿八日晚已由主席團推定錢大鈞，馬文車，李仲陽三人監察蓋印封存，廿九日上午當衆啓封，廿九日大會監察人已抽籤決定陳裕光，曾寶蓀等一百一十人。</p>
<p>〔本報南京廿八日電〕副總統選舉廿九日已至重要關頭，李宗仁·孫科兩候選人，將在第四次選舉副總統大會中作最後之決賽，會中各代表之投票結果，將決定李·孫兩氏之命運，故廿八日雙方均以全力爭取選票，尤以原爲支持程潛之兩湖·四川·河南各地代表，已成雙方宣傳爭取之主要對象。廿八日第三次選舉時，除程潛以票數仍居第三退出決賽外，李·孫兩氏選票各有短長，李氏在廿四日之第二次投票時，獲一一六三票，在廿八日之第三次投票時，則獲一一五六票，較第二次减少七標，然第三次發票二七四四張，投票二七三五張，少於廿四日第二次之發票。二七六五張，投票二七六〇張，故李氏票數减少原因殆爲出席者較少之故，孫氏在廿八日則獲一〇四〇票，較廿四日之九四五票增加九十五票，李·孫兩氏票數表現於廿八日之結果，至爲接近，而廿九日之第四次投票，只須較多數即可當選，不必一定超過代表總額之半數，故一票之微，亦須爭取。李·孫兩助選團廿八日竟日活動，分向各代表拉票，至爲積極。李夫人郭德潔，孫夫人陳淑英亦均終日奔走，不遑暇息。孫科下午六時半在立院邀宴兩湖代表，即席發表政見演說，希望兩湖代表能予支持，俾獲當選，而實現其政見，兩湖代表應孫科晚宴後，即于晚八時半應李宗仁之茶會，席間李氏亦發表演說，以其所主張之政治改革與程潛之改革意見相同爲號召，希望兩湖代表以支特程氏之熱誠轉而支持渠之當選·孫科並定廿九日晨八時招待河南代表早茶，籲請帮忙投票，迄廿八日深夜，雙方助選者仍奔走於代表寓邸，彼等活動之結果，將在廿九日之投票紀錄上作具體表現。</p>
<p>〔本報南京廿八日電〕總統·副總統當選證書，大會主席團廿八日晚開會討論，已決定於五月一日上午致送，致送典禮於大會堂中舉行，除已預定由于右任致送外，廿八日並推定胡適，于斌二氏於是日分別往迎總統·副總統。致送典禮儀式，廿八日主席團會中亦曾討論，惟尚待提出大會通過，主席團預定卅日上午再舉行大會一次，討論未完之提案及常設機構問題，加進行順利，一日下午即可閉幕，惟最後之確定，尚須視廿九日副總統選舉結果如何而定。</p>
<h3>第三次投票順利三候選人得票仍未達法定半數今日第四次選舉李孫爲候選人</h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿八日電〕國大廿八日晨舉行第三次選舉舉副總統大會，順利進行投票，惟結果三位副總統候選人所獲之票數仍均未達過半數，計李宗仁一一五六票，孫科一〇四〇票，程潛五一五票。按照選舉罷免法之規定，應就前兩名進行第四次投票，各就其中圈選一名。廿八日大會係於晨九時卅五分舉行，胡適主席，出席代表二七四四人，首由秘書長洪蘭友宣讀主席團報吿兩件：（一）廿四日第二次選舉副總統重行投票結果，副總統候選人李宗仁·孫科·程潛三人仍無人足法定過半數之票數，依照總統。副總統選舉罷免法第四條第三項第二款之規定，應舉行第三次投票圈選一名。（二）先後接准副總統候選人程潛·李宗仁·孫科三先生聲請放棄副總統候選人資格，經主席團第卅六次會議決議，推胡適。于斌。曾寶蓀。陳啓天。孫亞夫五代表勸請三位副總統候選人繼續競選，茲推于代表斌報吿訪談結果。繼由于斌報吿經過，略稱：本月廿五日主席團接獲·李·孫三先生之聲請放棄副總統候選人資格，主席團當於第卅六次會議中提出討論，認爲各候選人均係經數百人所簽署者，現正在選舉進行中，且已進至第三次投票，爲求大會順利進行起見，特推五代表分訪三候選人加以敦勸，所獲結果，甚爲良好，三位候選人均不再堅持放棄，故主席團決定今日舉行第三次選舉副總統大會。主席胡適稱：于斌先生已代表主席團報吿其經過，並說明主席團之意見，是否大會可不再加以考慮，而進行選舉之程序　時全體鼓掌，即獲通過，主席宣布，本日大會即改爲副總統第三次選舉大會。並請主席團代表白崇禧報吿有關選舉秩序之臨時提案，白氏即宣布八二三人之臨時提案一件，內容係盼以有效辦法制止會塲操從把持威脅選舉，及請蔣主席蒞會向大會報吿此次副總統選舉決自由競選之辦法，放白氏再說明會塲投票絕對自由，選票必須摺疊，不得傳觀等，並稱：蔣主席曾面諭本人說明完全由代表自由意志投票，特此轉達各代表。値茲戡亂緊急之際，盼大會順利完成，各自返回原崗位，從事戡亂。白氏報吿畢，由秘書長報吿選舉程序及投票開票之監察負姓名等。至十時半各項手續業已準備完畢，開始投票，十一時一刻投票完成，十一時四十分開票，至一時一刻十二票匭開票竣事。計發票二七四四張，投票二七三五張，其中廢票廿四張，計投票有效票二七一一張，末由主席報吿結果，略稱：本日投票結果，以李宗仁獲票最多，計一一五六票，孫科一〇四〇票，程潛五一五票，根據選舉罷免法，仍未有過半數者，副總統不能產生，應進行第四次投票，由本日投票結果獲票較多之前二名爲候選人，就其中圈選一名。第四次投票，決定於邪惡九日晨九時舉行，胡氏報告畢，即宣布散會。</p>
<h3>競選失敗道義獲勝程潛答謝投票人在孔雀廳中表明其心跡</h3>
<p>〔中央社南京廿八日電〕廿八日晚六時，贊助程潛競選之國大代表曁程氏助選團同人六百餘人齊集中央飯店孔雀廳，程氏於全塲熟烈掌聲中含笑入塲即席致詞，略謂：「此次選舉承各代表力予贊助，可謂完全出於正義感，亦爲眞正之良心票。廿八日第三次選舉之結果，原在本人意料之中，但本人惟一願望，輒爲大會之磒利進行，故仍勉爲應選。今日本人得票雖少，然仍認爲最大之光榮與愉快，本人對今日各代表熱誠之贊助，表示衷心感激。今日選舉後，若干友好紛紛以明日將如何投票相詢，余皆吿以宜遵照自由投票之原則，於兩候選人中擇其接近理想者投予神聖之一票，余個人亦復如此，余對政治有主張，有意見，今日在塲諸先生，皆余道義之交，患難之交，余願於大會閉幕後，再行邀約，交換對時局之意見。程氏詞畢，唐式遵，趙恒惕先後致詞，均强調程氏此次以道義人格相號召，雖已在選舉戰中失敗，而已在道義戰中獲勝，今後始爲道義奮鬥之開端。</p>

<h3>國大紀程　雨過天青選潮平—副總統誰屬且待下囘分解—</h3>
<p>〔本報特寫〕副總統選舉是本屆國大全部議程裏的高潮，而三個副總統候選人的相率聲明放棄競選，又是高潮裏的極峯，但是對這極峯的處理則是運用相當長時間的冷塲，這三日來令人捉摸不定的轉折變化，竟賴這最高技巧的冷塲一一交代淸楚，二十八日的大會，終於能順利進行，給人有柳暗花明的微妙感覺。</p>
<p>三日問的事在今天看看，眞如一塲夢，那種密雲不雨的鬱悶，那種拉緊心弦的緊張，那種驚東幻西的疑　，飛來傳去的謠傳，在二十八日會堂裏簡直尋不到踪影。天氣是和風煦陽，晴空襄了無半點雲醫，富應堂皇的大會堂照舊掩映在國旗裏，門首依然車水馬。李宗仁將軍和夫人郭德潔代表比肩立在大門前　階上，孫院長夫人則站在二門前右側，他們都歡笑着和到會的人拉拉手，問好道謝，祗差情緒不太緊張，一切和大前天一樣。會塲裏的代表們也安閑的和熟人寒喧或者獨坐讀報，宣傳品一張也不見，甚至連這兩天冷塲的事也沒人提起，普通的話題是；</p>
<p>「這兩日作何消遣？」</p>
<p>但這在開會之初，差不多使人不能相信，事實上，在這　鬆外表中仍包藏着一顆顆緊張的心，「會不曾出事？」「選得成選不成？」大家都惴惴然，大會像一隻船行在曲折的峽谷裏，周進有的是看得見的樹椿石塊，看不見的雜草暗礁，但幸虧了幾位好梢公，居然穩練的打發掉這一程，副總統的競選平安進入決賽階段。</p>
<p>大會主席是胡適校長，他和洪秘書長兩人謹愼而沉着的維持着會塲的秩序與會議的進程。第一個代表主席團報吿的是于斌主敎，他淸晰的報吿兩日來由於三位副總統候選人先後聲明放棄競選的問題而休會，但經主席團推派代表勸慰後，問題已吿解決，主席團於是決定繼續進行第三次選舉，不再由大會討論。這一次決定經胡主席鄭重徵詢大會同意，在陣陳掌聲裏過了第一個險灘。接着是白崇禧將軍代表主席團報吿八百多人的一個臨時動議，案由是請主席團以有效辦法制止會塲操縱把持威脅選舉。這動議原使許多人揑一把汗，担心會掀起風波。但白將軍的報告，對這一動議所提的辦法，一樣樣提出了主席團的考慮結果。他說：</p>
<p>「主席團以爲會塲內的投票絕對沒有毛病，選舉是絕對自由的，大家應該自動的保守秘密的權利，別把票給人家看。至於會外，蔣主席曾經一再宣稱他絕對支持各位代表先生憑自由意志投票」。他並且相信大家都希望大會任務能早日順利完成，」好回去執行戡亂」。</p>
<p>九點五十五分，胡主席宣稱改開第三次副總統選舉大會．洪秘書長和大會職員，表演着更爲迅速，嚴密而謹愼的工作精神。寫票間裏加備了吸墨水紙，「代表們要走在大馬路上」（某代表語）『一個會塲幹事也不許站」，「會塲裏請不要交頭接耳」（某代表語），「監察員和女代表們的什物「附件」都可以在主席台上暫存』。在洪秘書長一再不厭其詳的報吿解說後，又換一個與前兩次不同的分區次序。十點半正，投票開始，在井然有條空前奇佳的秩序下，全部投票時間才不過用去五十分鐘。待到十一點半，開票佈置停當，五分鐘後，胡主席宣佈開始開票。這時，被指定查騐選票的監察員女代表劉宦，推託着不肯登台，但終也在掌聲裏勉爲其難。</p>
<p>十二個票匭打開來，第一張票是程潛的，接着孫科和李宗仁比肩而上。第一二兩個票匭都是孫科佔先，第三個票匭則被李宗仁一馬當先，第六個票匭孫科又有起色，第七個票匭李宗仁票數陡跌，但依然佔先，這個局面一直到最後，李宗仁三賽又佔先，孫科緊跟不捨，程潛大見落後。局勢很明白，李宗仁的狀態仍舊，孫科則日有起色，程潛的選民已有一部跟了孫科。大體說，李宗仁和孫科已是短兵相接。在一點二十分胡主席宣佈過明日進行第四次副總統選舉大會後，大家心裏在說：</p>
<p>「看明日勝利誰屬？」（四月廿八日於南京）</p>
<h3>落選國代施昌壁絕食送院休養後失蹤內政部發言人聲明真相</h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿八日電〕內政部發言人稱：「施昌璧君係政黨提名湖南省黔陽縣國大代表候選人，選舉結果，得票比較少數，在國大召開前後，數度前來內政部面晤張部長本月七日施自行走入本部部長辦公室，經招待請俟部長到部再行延見，詎施君聞言即絕食而留辦公室不去，本部派員敦懇無效，乃勸其進食，爲之備有牛奶，餅乾，茶水不時食用，至次日即照常進食，並親筆開列菜單，令工友辦理，日以爲常。嗣本部復爲之安設床舖，供給棉被，俾得安矜。但迄本月十九日，施昌壁君忽又宣稱絕食（但仍食戀情菜肴並飲水），並向張部長提書面條件：（甲）立即停止潘壯飛出席國大，並登報聲明事實飭即重選，以重選結果核發當選證書；（乙）派遣出國留學及實施中央所提之國大分任辦法云云。繼於廿三日又親筆提出：（甲）保證派爲戡亂建國委會副主席或秘書長，在日內予以發表，否則由施同志以任何方式要求履行；（乙）補助施同志四億元，如中央有補助親定，則依中央規定加三倍，另補助五千萬元，以作住醫院調治之用；（丙）施同志任後四年國大代表之辦法仍予施行；（丁）對潘壯飛予以處分，至少使其不得担任戡建委員或其他職位云云。上述條件並要求張部長簽字，且有「勿將此短期間題，演成彼此私人間終生糾葛，以致以後隨時前來煩擾淸神」等語。本部因施君初到部時聲言絕食，雖未實行？爲確定責任起見，即由同人商請該管南區警察局派員侍候，用防意外，其每日起居及所發信件，所會見來客，諒警員均有記載。嗣於本月廿四日施君有入院休養之願，當由南區舒局長會同本都同人勸其移入中央醫院休養，即於當日用汽車送至中央醫院，開四一四號房間。茲接中央醫院廿六日公函，內開「昨日下午三時卅分及三時卅五分，二次由醫師前往注射針藥及檢查，均道拒絕，經報吿內科主任後，再於下午三時四十五分往視，發覺施君已不在室內，而同時陪伴之人員亦正在找覓中」等因。查施君個人之行動，在本部時往來各辦公室找人並打電話，極爲自由，在醫院中其個人行動之自由仍無拘束，誠恐外界不明眞相，特聲明經過情形如上」。</p>

<h3>挽救東北敎育的危機</h3>
<p>東北戰雲，近來已趨沉寂；但仍在密雲不雨烽火頻驚之中，我東北同胞之痛苦十分可念；而東北敎育的維持，以及自撤退都市流亡靑年的收客，尤其値得我們的關切。最近國民大會中之敎育提案，亦有關於救濟流亡失學育年的建議。我們際此來膽望當前東北的敎育，實不僅是一個救濟失學的問題。</p>
<p>上月間，敎育部主任督學黃曾　奉命赴瀋長各地視察東北敎育，返京已將　月；而當時所傳敎部擬在北平設立學校以收容東北撤退之大中學靑年之計，至今尚未見具體化。我們未見黃氏的全部報吿，惟就報上所透露的消息，並綜合本報駐瀋陽記者兩月來的報道，則目前東北國軍駐區之敎育情形，幾有岌岌不可終日之勢。</p>
<p>國家大局艱困至今，整個敎育都受到直接間接的打擊，而須統籌全般之捕救與解決。然如東北敎育危機之挽救，實爲關係我敎育命脈與國運前途根本之事，正應作時殊的觀察與分別的籌國。敎育部負金國敎育文化的重實，決不應只從事於枝節的局部的應付，而忽視整個遠大的方策。八年抗戰，所爲何事？日收回主權，曰恢復領土。而此恢復失地之對象，則九一八以後淪陷十四年而勝利後還歸祖國懷抱之東北，實爲其最大之主體。今日共匪割據中國，此乃暫時的現象。如果敎育當局漠視東北敎育，即將爲吾政府忽視此廣大領土之一徵，亦不啻貶損了中國抗戰的神聖意義。所以政府當局與社會人士必須共同注其全力，以挽救東北敎育的危機。</p>
<p>先就高等敎育言：我們主張將「烽火邊緣」的東北大學於暑假前完成遷校北平之計。這並不是說國軍有撤出瀋陽的準備，而是相反地為了配合駐東北國軍之有計劃的堅守猛攻，瀋陽暫無使高等敎育可以進行的安定環境。據說目下情形，遷與不遷同樣困難，當然以經濟的因素爲顧慮。然就抗戰時的已往經驗與國際與評看，惟有遷校較安定的地區乃可維持其發展。至於專科以上學校，一部分院系可與剿共軍事相配合者，其學生可從其自由志願酌留或調赴前方，協助戡亂工作，（如政工，或防守工事，或工礦恢復）。遷校後的東大或東北臨時聯大，第一必須嚴格甄別學生的成績以重定其年級，寗嚴毋寬；其次當充實其設備，尤其對於工學院的設施，應以配合恢復東北的工業建設需要爲原則，因爲高等敎育造就專材，必須着眼遠大的將來。此外則戰時東北靑年受敵僞愚民政策之籠絡，對於本國語文史地智識或低落或舛謬，故其共通的先修課程，必常加强文史敎育的師資與敎材。至於東北籍各院校學生之轉學寄讀問題，爲程度的限制，應不惜退級，而平津各公私立大學，對此似應有同情的雅量與適度收容的考慮。</p>
<p>其次談到中小學敎育，據本報三月十日瀋陽電，有說：「中學不脫救濟性質，學校少而學生多」，以及「小學窮困，國民敎育幾全部荒廢」等語，我們幾不能想像東北各地的中小學當育的實際情形，共匪　據地區的敎育那更不忍言了。縱或上面報道，言過其實；然東北物價暴漲中，學校師資與經費的嚴重一定什百倍於京滬。國民敎育在東北正是爲國家重新作育「新國民」，以代替而糾正己往日僞的荒謬敎育，爲國家政復地奠其新基。以任務重大如彼，而現狀如此，這決不僅是敎育的問題了。我們籲請負責東北軍政當局，必須正視現實，遠籌將來，向中央請求及就地籌補龐大經費，以收留大批有爲有學問的人來留住辦理國民敎育，特別灌輸以民族意識，抗戰　果，與戡亂的嚴肅意義；使欣欣向榮的小學生洞明順逆，蔚爲他日重建東北的幹部與眞正愛國的國民，中等敎育亦當守住「寗闕毌濫」的原則，甄別歸併，改良師資，而爲適應將來建設的需要，預防升學就業的矛盾，更應從因地制宜的各種不同的中等職業敎育的發展·至於如何供應國定審定敎本，便利有益書刋之運輸出版，取締低級與反動讀物，以輔進健全的民衆敎育的發展，也同樣有待於中央敎育當局之善導扶助，不僅是地方當局責無旁貸的任務。</p>
<p>最後，還有一義，願簡單的為我東北人士一陳者：此即從歷史與地理各種條件來看，尤其由於廿餘年日僞侵佔慘痛經騐之後，已確然證明東北爲我整個中國不可分離之一部，獨立的中國亦決不能失去東北而存在。因此，東北的建設與復興必賴全中國人的心力物力來經營，東北的敎育尤非僅僅東北九省人所能負擔，故必須打破以東北人自辦東北敎育的舊觀念。爲矯正宿弊以充實國家本位的意識，爲提高科學以配合工業復興的需要，必須打破畛域，歡迎各地人才到東北，共負作育人才復興東北的大業。</p>

<h3>蘇報評論莫德惠　對中蘇條約言論</h3>
<p>〔塔斯社莫斯科廿五日電〕中國國民大會外交提案審查（第三）委員會召集人莫德惠，曾發表言論，大意說，中蘇條約「已喪失其意義」，「眞理報」觀察家加以論列據稱：「一九四五年八月十四日締結的，爲期三十年的中蘇友好同盟條約，曾經以而且繼續以防止日本侵略死灰復燃，並於一旦遭遇此類侵略時實行互助爲其宗旨。由此可見，這個條約實爲中國的獨立與安全的基礎。」</p>
<p>「毫無疑問，中國人民大衆和進步人士，都異常重視這個條約，尤其是正當現在有人不惜作一切努力，以恢復日本的軍國主義與日本工業上的戰爭潛力的時候，中蘇兩國人民間的友好與同盟，實爲遠東和平與安全的基礎」。</p>

<h3>揭破積石山之謎　留下的問題是叩開自然寳庫門戶</h3>
<p>— 本報記者　洪絮才</p>
<p>〔本報特寫〕「積石山上無高峯，額非爾士峯仍居世界高山之皇座」。自央航公司探測專機完成任務後，積石山之謎業已揭曉，但人們不該以此爲滿足，因爲探測工作，原應包括各種科學上的考據和探索。繪測地形，測定經緯度，研究古冰川遺跡，調查地質·礦產·動植物·和人種·言語·風俗等，才能使這塊未開墾的處女地，充分發揮她的光輝！</p>
<p>記者此番參加了央航公司的探測隊，赴積石山上空翱翔十一小時，事後並曾分訪幾位專家，請敎此有關積石山的題材，願把自己親見的積石山現况，作個忠實的報道。</p>
<p>積石山位於靑海·甘肅·西康三省的邊區，靑海人稱之爲馬沁雪山，阿尼馬卿是藏語的譯音，作「崇高的老人」解。土人崇迷信，大小山脈均似「神」受拜謨，而阿尼馬卿山即被認爲「佛」，是「開天闢地的祖先」了。</p>
<p>積石山之所以受人注視，是由於它的高度之高，同時是中國具有歷史性的名山，可能比喜馬拉雅山年份更老。查「積石山」的名字，在「禹貢」內就已有發現，那該是漢代以前的事情。記者從機中看到的積石山，峭壁矗立者較少，多數都像個倒覆的碗，四周並無奇峯突起的情形。根據地理常識的判斷，大凡年代經久的山脈，因受風雨侵蝕，表面逐漸磨平壓低，所以積石山之有它的悠久的歷史，恐怕是不容懷疑的了。</p>
<p>從高空下瞰，積石山頭一片冰雪，我簡直不相信山上可能有一草一木生長，但是據專家估計，在雪綫以下是可能有生物的，只是機中肉眼看不出，推測那些動植物，必與北極圈內類似，有白熊·羚羊之屬。至於山中是否蘊藏着寶貴的礦產，那自然更不是憑空臆測得出的，西藏人盛傳阿尼馬卿是宗克巴發祥地，塔兒寺屋瓦黃金，就是從阿尼馬卿採來的。</p>
<p>積石山位於黃河第一河曲，它的走向是自西北蜿蜓而下至東南，愈向東，山愈低，黃河至貢馬桑拉之間北折，山亦就不見了。要找高峯，便須在西北方着手。根據地形學家，黃汲靑的觀察，積石山似不可能有高峯，理由是：（一）積石山三面是黃河，一面是高原。黃河高度不過三千公尺，在這狹窄地帶裏，要出現比河身高五千多公尺的高山是反常的。（二）大凡高山區域，如喜馬拉雅，喀喇崑崙等，往往是重巒疊嶂，層出不窮。而積石山則是孤另另地，兩邊直降黃河。（三）就地質構造說：世界各大洲的最高脈都是阿爾卑斯造山運動的產物，是新的摺皺山，積石山是古生代的摺皺山，是老山不是新山，其高度應遜遜於新摺皺山。但也有另一種論調，認爲積石山係一地壘塊狀山，黃河循其南北斷層綫而流，或其中受了大體內侵岩之衝入，皆可造成超越的高度。</p>
<p>不論上述兩種說法的孰是孰非，根據央航探測機實地勘量的結果，證實積石山上確無超過二萬呎以上的高峯。現在謎底揭穿了，留下的將是如何去叩開這自然寶庫的門戶，給世界歷史學，地質學，生物學和人種學寫出新的一頁。</p>
<p>中央研究院薩本棟等一行人，正忙於收集資料，埋頭苦幹，這劃時代的探險工作，可望於天高氣爽的秋節展開。届時將以高空探測和地面勘察同時配合進行，記者此番有機會赴積石山上空飛翔，特將飛行的路綫，經過測量各山的高度，溫度，氣壓，和飛行高度等，詳爲記錄，現特加以整理，倘能够供作第二次探測的參考，那就沒有白費心血了</p>

<p>「查理·梅葉」號自波斯灣東來，載油五千噸至香港，九千噸來上海。目前發現之大量　禁品究係何物，數量若干，因船長拍來之電報語焉不詳，故尚無所知。惟悉兩具屍體係在船側爲便於修理而裝置之箱形圖小發現。此箱形閘緊密不通風，為隱藏私貨之佳地。惟因空氣不流通，其中產生之一　化碳氣可能使走私者中毒致死，以前本市曾有海關關員在某輪船之箱形閘中檢查時開到其中污氣而昏倒，故船上發現之屍體，可能即爲窒斃之走私者。海關當局現已派巡邏艇等候，預備在吳淞口外將該輪攔截停駛後即上船搜查，以免共餘走私者在船靠岸後偷逃。</p>

<h3>戶口米銷售不暢　係因美米成色差</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕據民調會息，本市四月份售出救濟米較三月份少百分之五十左右，其原因有二：（一）四月份供應市上之救濟米，三分之二係美國米，國米僅七八萬包，而美米成色較差，不合市民口味，故戶口米銷售不暢。（二）市場價格與配售價相差不多。當局　於拋售食米不多，而能收穩定市價之效，現決繼續辦理三個月，下月份起配米將仍以美米爲主，國米爲輔，至來源則絕無問題云</p>

<h3>北平曾德崇　失戀自殺案　女主角在滬準備成婚　暢談相識來曲折隱情</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕北平警局機要室主任曾德崇因失戀而自殺一案，個中情形殊爲複雜，案中女主角方宜賢，現正寓居上海餘慶路愛某新村八號，記者昨日前往訪問時，其未婚夫駱存斌律師適亦在座。據方稱：渠與死者曾德崇相識，遠在民國廿八年，是時爲抗戰初期，方年僅十七，激於國家蒙難，乃投身第五戰區一七六師政治部任宣傳抗戰工作，死者當時爲政治部主任，爲其直屬上司。方以容貌娟秀，同事間向渠追逐者頗不乏人，而主任曾德崇爲其中追求最烈之一人，方處身其間，殊有應付爲難之感。</p>
<p>中計失身　悲憤欲絕</p>
<p>後曾利川職權，藉思想不純正爲由，陷方於獄，至廿九年春，戰事正在大別山進行，曾德崇在汪家冲一友人家中，設計將方自獄中提出，用　將其麻醉後，遂加以姦汚·翌晨，方發覺貞操已失，悲憤欲絕，乘曾不備之際，取得渠之自衛手槍，對之連放二槍，其中一槍中曾手臂，僅受輕傷，旋爲所奪，未肇慘禍。事後曾仍表示愛慕之忱，但方恨之切骨，固未嘗因此而稍减也。</p>
<p>此事不久傳播於軍中，一時人言嘖嘖，曾之行爲，旋爲上司所悉，遂將其撤職。方女不意經此恐怖之一夜後，竟而懷孕，至廿九年冬產一男，但僅四月，即吿夭折。</p>
<p>冤家路狹　芳心冷淡</p>
<p>旋戰事演變，方女隨軍輾轉至桂林，任職於工程委員會，不意寃家路狹，與曾又復相逢，是時，曾已爲桂林綏靖公署諮議及省政府參議，惟對方女猶未忘情，時往糾纏，但方女依然處處冷淡。同時方女於此際與駱存斌開始相識，傾談之下，駱對之甚表同情，久之申憐生愛，終而宣吿正式訂婚。不久勝利來臨，曾德崇經介紹，赴平任警局機要室主任之職，而駱存斌旋亦來滬，方女隨後繼之南下，兩人一度返女之故里安慶一行。其間方女曾與死者家屬時有信函來往，蓋死者爲廣西桂林人，渠之胞兄曾志沂與曾予春，現均任職北平軍政敎育界，固皆有地位之人士也。過去方女之事，因曾德崇屢向家人聲述，咸對之甚爲關切，昆仲間雖屢加規勸，但曾德崇始終執迷不悟。</p>
<p>執迷不悟　演出悲劇</p>

<h3>工業同業公會改組　決按原定步驟進行　會員資格標準已放寬</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕關於本市各工業同業公會改組情形，據社會局第二處處長王家樹語記者稱：自工業會法頒行後，社會局奉社會部令，指導各重要工業區同衆公會及市屬工業同業公會依新法改組，曾分別召集會議，指示進行事宜，當時各公會所諷爲最感困難者，即爲會員資格須依照工廠法草案規定，具有發動機器，平時雇用工人三十人以上，或未具有發動機器平時雇用工人六十人以上者，若依此標準嚴格執行，凡不合上述條件之小型工廠，均必須退出現有公會，將使各公會發生普遍困難，社會局業將本市工業實際情形呈報社會部，請求放寬標準，凡不合標準之工廠，原已加入公會者，仍准登記入會，此點已奉社會，經濟二部允准，故改組工作已可順利進行。現各公會約有三分之一已定期召開改組大會，至遲在五月中旬可望全部改組完竣，外傳在商會法未修改前將展緩改組工業公會，及本市一部份工業公會請求展緩改組期限至十月份一節，社會局尚未奉社會部有何新指示，各工業公會改組工作，決仍照原定步驟進行，至於一切改組手續及注意事項，均應依照社會部及社會局規定爲依據，其他任何團體所定辦法，無決定効力。</p>

<h3>瘋之謎案開庭　嚴培興有無神經病　兩醫師診斷不相同　尙待另請專家斷定後再審</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕「瘋之謎」案，關於袁寶英控吿嚴培興有神經病，訴請判令禁治產部份，昨晨由何憲章推事開民七庭訊問，由公濟醫院神經精神兩科主任醫師韓芬及普慈醫院主任醫師黃英邦作證，首傳澳大利籍韓芬醫師證稱：一四月五·六·七三日，先後爲嚴診斷，幷聽取其親友之陳述，自始至終，未發現彼有任何精神病狀態。四月十八日，會同滬江大學心理學敎授威司勃勞克再加診斷，結果據該敎授發表結論，亦不能發現嚴之腦內組織有任何病熊徵象。惟根據嚴之過去行爲，可斷定爲一</p>
<p>自卑感者，因有「自卑感」，故常思獲得權位，爲他人尊重，此乃對不快現實之一種逃避，自卑感者常有誇大之動作，其若干荒誕字條，或可由此得到解釋」。</p>
<p>繼由黃英邦醫師作證，黃因患病，經庭上允准坐答證稱：「嚴培興於本年二月九日下午五時左右，由袁寶英　同來院求治，病者進院後病態，</p>
<p>可分三期</p>
<p>第一期興奮不安，失眠，及誇大思想；第二期漸趨安靜，時而興奮，時而痴呆，沉默寡言，睡眠有進步；第三期安靜，未有誇大語言。據檢查所得結論：（一）非大腦梅毒，（二）可能爲週期性猜疑性之精神病，惟此項病症在短期間殊靴斷定，（三）住院時期之病狀，先興奮誇大，後略呈憂鬱，（四）以上各種現象，對於情緒極敏感，精神不平衡，及不能自制之人，亦可能因受到一時刺激，而爲一種偶發性的精神失常反應」。</p>
<p>被吿嚴培興除當庭呈遞</p>
<p>答辯狀，說明渠無精神病外，並提出該廠四月二十二日之會議錄一本，以證明彼有能力處理事務，並當庭指出黃醫師曾向其需索十億元，謂有錢即放　出院，惟庭上對此未予追究。繼由嚴之代理律師起立辯稱：按民法第十四條之規定，係指無間斷性精神病狀態而言，與被吿現象並不適合，且原吿所提出證據，均爲陳跡，請求庭上駁回原吿之訴。</p>
<p>末何推事宣稱：本案如證據齊全，則逕行裁定，但尚有疑問　須由本國著名精神病專家再　　　　，　韓芬係外籍醫師，經過輾轉翻譯，恐有辭不達意之處，故須俟再診斷後，再行定期開庭審訊。</p>

<h3>戴德參觀我紗廠後　認為經營效率甚高</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕盟總紡織組組長戴德，廿四日抵滬後，連日參觀本市各大紗廠，並與紗管會有所洽商。戴氏昨接見記者稱：自中國紡織廠之產品觀察，足見經營效率甚高，管理亦佳。美援中爲數達一億五千萬美元之棉花供給，對中國紡織業爲一極大助力，因由於馬歇爾計劃之實施，歐洲將取得超過五億美元價値之美棉，故在美國市塲上，將因此巨大需要而感購買之不易，希望中國得此供應後，能按照各廠之生產情形，作最公平合理之分配。盟總對日本紡織業，希望能開工至四百萬錠，但在未來之若干年內，中國之紡織產品將用以滿足自身之需要，故不致與日本發生尖銳之競爭云。</p>

<p>又據靈　寺致函本報稱：陳子展在山宴客，所用廚司，係陳氏自滬雇去，當時以該寺豆油菜油不適口，乃臨時專向蘇城萬年橋一家油行購買白生油二十斤，到山時已過午，廚司始匆忙烹調，飯後確有一部份來賓嘔吐，惟該寺佾侶二百餘人，皆平安無事云。</p>

<h3>本年度所需茶貸款項　中農已分別調撥　茶商要求增加恐不易辦到</h3>
<p>本年度茶貸，中國農民銀行即開始發放。該行業務處處長周夢馨，已於日前來滬，向中央銀行商洽調撥款項事宜。農行已就四聯總處核定之總額八四九〇億內，配定各產區加工，運銷，及押款之貸款數額，昨日已得中央銀行劉總裁之許可，今日即可分別調撥淸楚。據周氏談稱：歷年政府舉辦茶貸，供給低利資金之運川，全在較勵出口，爭取外匯。本年四聯總處核定之八四九〇億元，政府本身已盡最大之努力。此項貸款，分三期貸放。第一階段爲加工貸款，第二階段爲箱茶運銷貸款，第三階段爲出口箱茶押款。箱茶運　貸款時，即扣回加工貸款，出口箱茶押款時，扣回運銷押款。是項貸款，茶商可循環應用，對茶商確有極大之帮助。又據另悉：茶商對四聯總處核定之茶貸數字，認爲過少，貸款時間亦覺過短，希望政府增加，並將正式提出要求；但據有關方面悉，政府對此不擬有所攷慮。</p>
<h3>華股繼續趨疲　市塲交易清淡</h3>
<p>華股昨以副總統之競選繼續，物資平淡，業中人興趣亦吿鬆弛，各股繼續趨疲，交易淸淡，僅永紗尚有臨收時之最後掙扎。</p>
<p>晨初人心即現不定，永紗開低至二〇二五元，開後升至二〇三五元，外匯牌價未更，一〇二號等紛售，跌落至二千元大關。但銀根甚鬆，代辦費亦開低至一六元及一九元，略有小回風，曾升至二〇二五元，但以新買奄無，十一時半後，浮多先行潰散，跌至一九七九元，午收意被迫低至一九八三元。副座之競選恢復，各項物資見回，股市人心更爲不支矣。較前收計中法閘北新華景綸信和華新均跌半成，餘股咸告小挫。</p>
<p>後市上塲一九九五元，國行差出，回升至二〇三〇元·臨收時由一九七號一四五號抬高至二〇三五元，收市二〇三〇元。較晨收計麗安國貨尚平，餘股一致微漲。塲外各未上市股票平庸而稍挫。</p>
<p>外股　昨各股榮辱俱見，存底有限，易升難落。怡紗晨開三一九萬，自三二三萬降至三一六萬，臨收仍易回升至三二三萬結束，成交不多，求供有限，結果與前收相較計英聯會德豐鋼業紙版小挫，怡紗業廣微升，怡啤航業平平。</p>
<p>公債　昨繼續向榮，成交約五百萬。統丙晨開一二萬元，自一二萬二盤高到二三萬九結束。較前收計甲乙丁各升一萬二，丙種好起一萬六，戊種漲一萬五。</p>

<h3>自備外匯進口物資　公會發表登記數目</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕據進出口業公會代表華洪濤稱，關於自備外匯物資進口登記數目，報載略有不符。據稱以前向輸管會登記總數共四六〇〇萬美金，其中除去半途卸下不運來上海者外，共計三五〇〇萬元美金。至現在止，已向中信局申請收購者約計一千六百七十件，共二八〇〇萬元美金。其中已由中信局配售，即已結定外匯者約一千四百八十件，合計二一〇〇萬元美金。</p>
<p>又前日下午十六進出口業同業公會開會報吿事項如下：外幣存單劃分辦法，根據過去已決定之辦法劃分二期，每月到期一張。此種外幣存單，聞政府正在趕辦中，不日即可發下。政府收購自備外匯貨物所給予十分之一合法利潤，可於發給外幣存單時，同時發給·關於外幣存單抵用問題，進出口業希望能於第四五兩季進口限額中同時抵用。</p>

<h3>紗花布交易清淡</h3>
<p>昨日棉紗市况，因値紡建配售之期，額子甚夥，本街缺商納胃呆滯，外埠採辦亦淸，市氣趨軟。四十二支藍鳳細紗開收盤價格同爲二億三千三百萬元，比上日回落二百萬。水月及金城亦跌去二三百萬元，二十一支雙馬紗雖有浮多拉抬，卒以供過於求，較跌四百萬元，以一億五千六百萬結束。其餘各支粗細紗亦軋落一二百萬至三四百萬元不等。</p>
<p>昨日棉布市况，以紡建上日大量供售，市上籌碼充沛，號家供多求少，客帮去化轉淸，本市門銷亦淡。十二磅龍頭細布由五百零三四萬，一路下游至四百九十八萬元收市，比上日回小七萬元。五福彩球藍鷄等細布亦軋落四五萬至八萬元，其他各布均疲，惟士林布穩定。</p>
<p>又紡建公司供售之藍鷄細布，准購單初做平掉，中途倒貼一二萬，最後則倒貼三萬元，爲四百五十三萬元有做開。喇叭童細布做四百六十四萬，三A彩球四百四十七萬，四君子元嗶嘰府綢均倒貼五六萬元，府綢爲五百六十萬元。</p>
<p>昨日現棉市况平淡，交易淸稀。惟近日產區價格則漲勢甚勁，棉商手中執貨不多，一經脫手，抵補反見虧蝕，故供售稀少，交易僅少數客販，軋於銀根，略有成交。涇陽做開二五〇〇萬，鄭州二五三〇萬，漢口夾細二〇〇〇萬，火機一九五〇萬，二〇〇〇萬，周浦籽花五〇六萬至五〇八萬。</p>

<h3>「科學與政治」</h3>
<p>— 楊實</p>
<p>（“Science　and　Polictics”，ByProf．A．D．Ritchie，Oxford　Univesity　Press，London，1947）</p>
<p>科學的神速進展和政治的危機，兩者不協調的結果，便是今日的世界遭遇到了非常困難而迫切的問題。仇恨·隔膜一天天在加大；危機紛亂一天天在加深使我們覺得人類已把自己投在一個幾乎無法解決的問題的苦淵中了。比之一九一四年還要危險，人們又開始有着「以戰爭消除戰爭」這種可怕的想法。已經結束了十年大屠殺的兩三年，今天我們實在再禁不起這些神經上的刺激。但這是問題；明智的人無法閉着眼睛聽任那些政治角逐人物去瞎闖，一且闖出禍來，誰也無法去遇止；反之，他們得正視它，企圖去運用自己的智慧來找出一條人類最安全的路。</p>
<p>英國達那姆大學（Draham　Univer—sity）的李契敎授（Prof．A．D．Rit—chie）在其近著「科學與政治」一書便是廣泛的討論這些迫切的問題的，原文是由在該大學的「里德紀念講座」（RiddleMemorial　Lectures）的演講詞　編出來，故仍顯得淸爽和通俗。他的論題絕不僅限於「原子彈的管制問題」而廣泛的論及科學（自然也包括科學家）在這世界上倒底扮演着何等重要到角色，以及他們在一個國家中所生的一些重大影響；並且提出科學在政治上的新意義。</p>
<p>人類的文化發展到今天已使科學和政治緊密的迎在一起，單獨談論科學幾乎是不可能的；所以李契敎授把它們連在一起討論。試看一個國家利用了科學的偉大力量，好可以增進人類幸福，壞便可以整個毁滅了人類；於是一此站在局外的明智之士（也包括那些光追求眞理不考慮後果整天埋頭在試驗室裏的局外科學家）已感到迷亂和　憤了。一個冷靜的科學家由於道義上的責任感，他一定驚慌並且得去想像一下；這些未受到良好的科學敎育的政治家們握着這使用科學的威力的權柄後，將會國出多少可怕的亂子來。</p>
<p>作者自己承認他正作這　一個美夢，他盼　政治權柄和會選用科學的能力都握在一隻手裏，意思要把國家的最高統治權讓給科學家。他說：「科學家有力量去毀滅這個世界，就會有力量去拯救這世界。」</p>
<p>然而科學和政治又是一對不相讓的死寃家，一們第一流的科學家要完全過政治生活就不能再保持他在科學上崇高地位，由於科學的飛躍進展一，更由於政治是一件需要整個時間的工作。一個科學家同時又從事成功的政治活動幾乎是不可能。李契敎授說：「我們的所謂政治活動絕不是出席幾次議會辯論。佔幾個部長位置，或者是什麼皇家顧問委員就行了。」由於近代國家權利的擴展，一個活躍的政治家是要付出全身精力去接觸他要遭遇的一切問題的；因之他無法再去從事另一種事變。英國這種例十很多，常常大學選舉區推選的代表多是一事不關，僅掛個名而已。讀者也許認爲這僅只是西方民主國家（指英，法）的現象，但作者却說：「無論東方民主國家（指蘇聯）西方民主國家是一樣的，問題是科學家是否願意拋棄他的科學上優越地位而去追求他不感興趣的政治權柄。」</p>
<p>作者說來說去好像是夢，不易實現成事實，所以他提出另外一種使科學家的政見有效的有機會的表達出來的辦法，多增加他們在議會的議席，把卓越的科學家都推舉成上院議員，對像皇家學會這種機構的發表政見給一特殊重視。但就這困難還是有的，政治領袖是否很順從的和他們合作就是困難中之一。因之他又轉向政治領袖勸導了一番。（譯自倫敦「Natural」週刋）</p>
<h3>薩本棟著　交流電路</h3>
<p>— 士諤</p>
<p>（部定大學用書·正中書局出版·定價十四元）</p>
<p>各種工程中以電機工程較難研習，蓋其所探討者恒包含有時間與空間兩者關係，瞬息演變，同時於電路網絡交聯時，更有相互感應之發生而使問題益形複雜，因此我們一面要賴物理的現象來辨別其質的究竟，一面更要應用高深的數學原理以推論其黃的多寡，初學者對此要想一蹴而幾，自屬相當困難，而其中交流電路一科，尤爲研習電機工程者所必經之階梯，亦爲電機系最重要之必修科，蓋非藉此先作充分之準備，則進而研究電力或電訊工程之本身，必感困難重重，而有無法應付之苦，所惜者國內此類書籍尚未之見，而非賴歐美著作不可，殊爲憾事。</p>
<p>最近正中書局已有交流電路一書出版，實爲今日國內工程界一大可慶事，該書爲我國物理學權威薩本棟先生精心傑著，全書由淺入深，釋理詳明，可無須藉高深之數學，即能順利閱讀，且文筆生動流暢，讀來毫無如一般科學書之令人有枯澀之感，尤以運用複數以表顯交流電勢，電流及電功率之方法，更有獨到之處。</p>
<p>該書內容第一章即以複數開端，詳論其演算與運用之方法。第二章述正弦電勢與電流，演繹各主要公式，予讀者以淸晰之基本觀念。第三章至第五章分述電路中各主要常數，如阻抗導納等之複値意義，對電功率之運用複値計算，則更專章論述，至爲詳明。第六章開始，乃討論較複雜之問題，首述等値繼絡之互換解算及其應用。第七章述互感與變壓器，使讀者對交流電機之基本原理，得先有充分之瞭解。第八章述電路之暫時狀態，由初步徵分方程　發引論，先直流，次交流，最後論繁複之織合電路，由簡而鐵，使讀者前後比較，便於憶悟。第九章述多相制之平衡，輸送及功率之測量諸問題，最後一章述諧波，詳論如何將一週期的波形分解爲多個正弦的彼形，複論非正弦波之各影響，曁諧波之各種分析法。</p>
<p>著作固難，校刋亦非易事，此爲有經騐之出版界所公認，該書所用各種符號，形形色色，各有特殊意義，毫釐之差，每每盡失原意，該書雖不能絕無誤權，然以今日國內之出版水準言之，實已難能可貴，非對斯學研究有素而出版經騐宏富者，不能任其事也。</p>
<p>總而言之，該書不失爲交流電路之佳作；較之美國名著之Lawrence　Principe　of　Alternating　Currents，更適宜於作爲大學之敎本，蓋材料較多，合乎需要；所附習題便於敎學，尤其特色。</p>
<h3>辛稼軒年譜評介</h3>
<p>— 常模</p>
<p>鄧廣銘編撰　商務印書館發行</p>
<p>我最喜歡辛稼軒的詞。抗戰期內，流浪於大後方各地區，在跋山涉水的途程當中，在逃避敵人的空襲而蜷伏於谿谷之中或林泉之濱的時候，我總不忘記把稼軒詞携以相隨。讀其詞，想見其爲人：上馬殺賊，下馬賦詩，激昂慷慨，痛快淋漓。因此，也更願意知其平生事跡之詳。</p>
<p>近年以來有關稼軒的一些論著，不管是評論稼軒的作品的，或是傳述稼軒的生活的，我都盡量搜集購買。經我搜求到的短文和專著已在十種以上，其中却很少能使我感覺滿意的。去冬，北平友人替我買來一本鄭騫作的稼軒年譜，我在上海又買到徐嘉瑞作的稼軒評傳，稍加翻閱，更使我發生了「每况愈下」之感。今春我買來商務印書館新出的鄧廣銘先生所作的稼軒年譜，和他所輯校的「稼軒詩文鈔存」二書，心願才大得滿足。對於辛稼軒生平事跡的搜討，鄧先生這兩種書幾乎可以說「歎觀止矣」了。</p>
<p>前於復旦學報第一期內曾讀到鄧先生的「辛稼軒交遊老」一文，經他所考川的辛稼軒生前的朋友竟達二百人之多，對於作者這種廣搜博採的功力，我已不勝其敬佩，而在這本稼軒年譜當中，其對稼軒生平事跡鈎稽之廣，創獲之多，縝密周詳的程度，又遠在「稼軒交遊考」之上了。</p>
<p>稼軒詩文，失傳已久；宋史本傳，叙事不詳。所以，關於辛稼軒的生平，不但日用行常的一些瑣細事項難於者求，即如他前半生的「兩分帥　，三駕使軺」（稼軒的新居上梁文中自述語），以及後半生的任福建安撫使，浙東安撫使，和鎭江知府諸經歷，均是獨當一面，身膺重寄，不論對稼軒本人或對當時的軍政局勢說，都不能不算是大有關係的事，而前此一般傳述稼軒生平的人，包括前淸中葉的辛啓泰和情末民初的學術大師梁啓超在內，對這些事全都未能考證明白，則其必是因爲書缺有間之故而致難於從事，也可想見。而鄧先生在這本年譜當中，大量地引用了徐松所輯的「宋會要稿」，和宋人纂修的一些地方志，如淳熙三山志，嘉定鎭江志，景定建康志，開慶臨汀志等，不僅對於稼軒仕宦各地的年月有了極確定的記載，對其每一次的遷轉和廢罷的因由也全都有了極詳細的解說。作者游刃有餘，而一切具有關鍵性的問題，也是一向論辨紛紜莫衷一是的一些問題，却全已迎刃而解了。</p>
<p>另外與稼軒本身具有重要關係的一些事項，如稼軒少年時候和黨懷英共同受學於毫州的劉瞻，而不是受學於蔡伯堅，這本年譜中引用元遺山「中州集」中黨劉二人的小傳，已確定證明了；稼軒南歸之後，娶了另一個南歸的忠義人范邦彥的女兒爲妻，這年譜中根據牟　的陵陽集和劉宰的漫塘文集得到了明白的答案了；稼軒會以詩詞參請蔡光的事，從陳模的懷古錄中找到這傳說的娘家了（過去全是從徐釚的詞話叢編展轉引用的）；稼軒和朱熹的深厚的交誼，從朱子語類當中找到了更多的注脚了；稼軒少年　曾深入金國腹地，晚年守嘆江時曾多方這諜偵察金國的軍情，也都從程秘的洺水　中找到了稼軒的長驚自述了。諸如此類，舉不勝舉，無一不是這本年譜中的創獲。</p>
<p>說也奇怪，上述的一些問題，如果是每一個傳述稼軒生平的人所必應考究的，則上述的一些書籍也便應當是每個人必須去加以翻檢的吧，而事實却是只有鄧先生才眞去翻檢過，考究過。即如宋會要稿一書，在辛啓泰的時代方始輯出，在梁啓超的時代尚未影印，二氏之不及參考固是理之當然，而鄭鶱和徐嘉瑞二氏之書却是新近作成的，兩人也竟　然不知道世間已有此一書，豈不可怪？</p>
<p>話再說回，鄧先生雖已盡了廣搜博採之能事，我却還可以貢獻一條補充材料。在元人干欽所著「齊乘」的人物志中，有稼軒的一段小傳，其中有「宋人以傖荒目之而不柄用」的話，又說「宋實錄敝幼安贊韓　　用兵，　　敗，幼安獲罪于士論」。這些似乎全値得引錄干稼軒年譜當中。近見鄧先生對於辛譜又有補遺的文章，不知此條已經補入否？</p>
<h3>介紹「生物趣味」</h3>
<p>— 狄山</p>
<p>（姚毓璆著·開明書店新刊）</p>
<p>用文學體裁寫出科學趣味一類的文字，呌做「科學小品」，首倡於民國二十四年創刋的「太白」半月刋；其後這類文字，漸漸爲讀者所愛讀，也漸漸多了從事研寫的作者。</p>
<p>早十年，開明書店就出了賈祖璋的「生物素描」，克士的「花鳥　魚」，以及陶秉珍的「昆虫漫話」等，這些「科學小品」結集始終是讀者愛讀書。本年三月，開明又新出了姚毓璆著的「生物趣味」。</p>
<p>這本書收在「開明少年叢書里」，是一本用淺顯文字表達生物形。性及其他方面的趣味書。</p>
<p>全書共收廿一篇，十四篇是有關動物的記載，七篇是描述植物的文字·在動物方面由極小的蚤虱到龐大體軀的象，每一篇都有較新的研究，作者的目的，不但是要讀者認識每一種動物，而且還希望由此引起研究生物的興趣，所以作者文字是經過一番洗鍊的功夫的</p>
<p>例如「社鵑」一篇的開頭，作者的文字是很美的：</p>
<p>——春天去了，天氣從溫和漸漸轉到悶熱，大地上也已重新換上了一套深綠的衣衫，在濃柳間，我們除了不時的看見燕子像穿梭似的在飛掠外，森林中還可看到一種灰黑色的杜鵑，牠是夏的使者，牠現在已開始將那種悽婉的鳴聲，播送給人間了。</p>
<p>又如記蟬的鳴聲</p>
<p>——牠有時宏亮高亢，有時激越淸幽，處處都替人帶來了翩翩然的感覺，使我們心中消去了不少的愁意。</p>
<p>植物里的一篇「梅」，可以說是純「散文」，當我們　到名句「暗香浮動欲黃昏」時，也不禁由作者的筆下想出一幅蒼老高雅的姿態。</p>
<p>平常讀慣動植物學或是生物學一類敎材而感到枯燥無味的人，我介紹你去看這本「生物趣味」，你一定會欣然認爲原來生物界是這樣美麗可愛呵！</p>
<h3>讀「生死戀」</h3>
<p>— 劉釗</p>
<p>林淑華著　新紀元出版社發行</p>
<p>「生死戀」在优伉儷月刋按期發表的時候，曾冠以「長篇創作」的名稱；但當我讀完單行本時，只覺得全書與其說是創作小說，毋寗謂是作者的自傳，似乎更爲恰當。</p>
<p>我不知別位讀者在讀完此書之後，是不是也贊同我這個看法。而且我又有一個偏見，認爲如果以自傳的眼光去讀這本書，讀者更易爲書中的情節所感動。照一般的說法，以情節感動讀者，原不一定是作者的最大成功；可是我却認爲每一本文學作品的成功，旣以引起讀者共鳴爲主要的條件之一；那末，作者通過情節的叙述，獲取讀者的共鳴，實在未始不是一種寫作技巧·在這一點上，作者林淑華女士是已經成功了。</p>
<p>生死戀全書計二十二軍，以「身世」始，以「長恨」終，整個的故事是一個女主角與男主角戀愛，結婚，成家，立業而終至干男主角病殁，女主角悼亡，構成了「生死戀」悲慘的結局的經過。這　面寫到男女主角在封建勢力下因戀愛不自由而發生的苦鬥，寫到抗戰期間女主角捨身爲國的事實，寫到男主角的勇毅正直，百折不撓的努力，寫到雙方排除萬難而結合的歡樂，寫到男主獻身於社會病家完全忘却「小我」的服務精神，寫到女主角在悼亡以後，承繼丈夫遺志，獨立支撑一家生活，甚至以縫紉爲職業的經過，最後又寫到女主角終至不幸患了肺病而生活陷入絕境的悲劇。凡此，作者都寫得非常眞切，非常細膩，非常動人，我想每一個讀者在讀完此書之後，對書中的女主角不引起共鳴的，恐怕是絕無僅有的罷！</p>
<p>就整個故事的叙述來說，也許有人會覺得作者的筆法很像舊式的小說，但其實作者極能跳出庸俗的戀愛小說的格調。作者的筆法是淸新的，嫵媚的在我所讀過的女作家的作品中，作者頗有別創一格的特點。例如：</p>
<p>「我想到我們婚前：爲了要爭取我們自由的生活，你曾不斷地鼓勵我，安慰我。我們仍含着淚，忍受外界的許多壓迫；我們也曾咬着牙，跟　勢力作了最大的搏鬥；威脅利誘，軟騙强迫；任何阻撓，都分不開我們相愛着的心；任何打擊，都離不散我們相繫着的情。一年，一年，又一年！送走了中秋的團圓月，又迎着了明年的早春花；看着花開，又看着花落……。到第十年，我們才從舊的被束縛的圈子裏掙扎出來，開始飛入我們理想，自由的天地中」。（長恨）</p>
<p>當然，作者的文簫也並非毫無可議之處。就我看來，似乎有些地方，稱嫌拖沓，有些地方，又太多激動字句，頗有濫用　情之嫌。但據我的猜測，大概作者本是一個富於熱情的女子，則在無意間隨處流露感情，自屬無怪其然。不過就作品的本身而言，我們實不得不認爲是一種小疵。</p>
<p>據作者在自序中說，作者只受到中學還未畢業的敎育；這是令人頗感驚喜的。今日靑年寫作能力之低，已成爲一種公認的事實；然則作者以一個中學尚未畢業的學養，能寫成一册這樣動人的自傳，實在是難能可貴，不得不認爲是寫作的天才了。</p>
<p>雖然，我以爲「天才」這東西，在今日的文壇上，也應該作適當的培育；如果是一味的瞎捧，作者的天才是很容易立刻凋萎的天才究竟是天才，不加上刻苦的鍛鍊和努力，無論如何，是不能達到成功之域的·「生死戀」雖然是一册不易多得的佳構，但離完全成功的境域尚遠，這是批評者應該特別注意的。尤其是作者自己，也應該有同樣的自覺，不能認已有的進步爲滿足，應該繼續努力，繼續進　；對干外界的批評，不能毫無主張地全部接受，忘了自己的實際能力。這是我對作者一個至誠的忠吿。</p>
<p>（編者按：關於本書，我還接到嚴演方先生的一篇評介，因爲篇幅有限，不能同時刋出。爲歉。嚴先生鼓勵作者說：「我要向作者吿慰：你的身世雖苦，但社會上同情你的人很多。今後希望你把十二年的往事，置之腦後，再接再厲的生活下去，奮鬥下去！」</p>

<h3>命題作文</h3>
<p>— 念鴻</p>
<p>很多敎育家們這樣說：一般中小學裏的作文大都是先由敎師預定題目，然後再敎學生照題發揮的，這樣的做法，往往限制了學生的思想，所以寫不出好文章來。</p>
<p>我想這話特指中小學生，也許是對的，因爲中小學生的思想還沒有健全，不能運用如意，所以只得跟着敎員出的題目的字義上打轉，逃不川他的範圍，但是如果指一般的說，那就朱必盡然了，文字是思想的發抒，是以代表人的所想所作，思想絕不能用什麽東西來限制它，那末文字中的　義，又豈是題目所能堵截得了的？同一標的物，各人太其立塲之不同，就有不同的見解，植物學家見了樹林便想到它的種別；匠人見了却想那些是棟樑之材，那些是不成大器的；然而在詩人眼光中看來，它便是誦讚自然的大好資料了。</p>
<p>固然，題目可以限制一部分思想。但這中間迴旋餘地依然很大，還是有許多文章可作的，假使你肯化些精神去研究的話。聽說過有一次某期刋徵文，題目古怪得很，只是一個「一」字，結果發表的二篇佳作中，一篇說到天下一家世界大同解除一切人類間猜疑的必要；另一篇恰恰相反，它强調個人主義，以爲唯有經個人一己一體作爲出發點，才是成功大事的捷徑。我們姑不論誰寫得是誰說得錯，至少可以看出則使是極奇特的題目，依然可以發揚開來，暢言自己的思想和見解。</p>
<p>目前社會上的一種見解，便是過份强調了題目的限制能力，認爲題目旣定，一切努力都逃不出它的範圍，因之消極地覺得勞而無功，還不如讓它去休。我們自然不能忽視了大題目，事實上有許多事是和它休戚攸關的，不能單獨解決，但是並不是說，因之什麼都沒有辦法或希望了。只要盡個人听能，依然是可以設法得到一些成功的。例如一般的機關中負責人總是說本機關不能發揮功效者，實是受了經濟窘迫的影響，目前各機關中經濟情形確是事業發展的致命傷，但是把一切失敗都推到經濟問題上面去，那也未必就對，除了經濟之外，我們知道仍有不少缺點是可以改進的，而事實上並沒有改進。</p>
<p>總之，我們不能專責題目的限制，把自己的責任忘記掉，須知惟有各人都盡自己的責任，才是打破題目限制的方法。</p>
<h3>王湘綺手札</h3>
<p>— 錢大成</p>
<p>余藏有湘綺老人王　運手札一通，坊本王氏尺牘所不載，乃致先外曾祖曾公竺如（諱慶溥）者。時在民國元年夏曆六月十八日，（郵戮則爲國曆八月一日，尚沿川大淸郵票。）　運居湘潭之山塘，曾公則流寓衡州。公歷任長沙衡州知府，與　運時相過從，湘綺樓日記中層屢提及。吾母吿余：　運每至府衙，所眷周媽輒隨往，　運　辮細小若春蚓，扶周媽肩而入，　運坐，周媽亦坐，朋輩與笑謔，不以爲忤。每至必索食點心，可嚀欲會公侍姬手製。此札作於變革之際，湖南已光復。書中有云：「譚仳兄久斷音問。周生係第倡言欲殺之人，若知與弟往來，必將瓜蔓。……燕堂非久，尊事自有了言。……各處失業者多，必無盡受凍餓之理；委天任命，弟實確有所見，當此時勢，更不容遠計明年也。」譚世兄係指譚延　先生，周生指第一任湖南都督周某，周某後被殺，後任某又被殺；衆乃擁戴延　先生出任領袖。時湖南情勢混亂，人心惶惶，已入恐怖局面，堅辭不獲，始出山，家人聚哭送之。札中所云瓜蔓言者，亦非過甚其詞；委天任命，亦不得已也。又云：「今皆以外國爲冰山，外國自以爲泰山，以此安人心也。」怪語不經，不知作何解釋。復云：「山居無物可寄，剖瓜百餘枚，未逢佳者。」楊旡恙先生請；「剖瓜云云，提刀人想是周媽無疑。」斯言殊堪解頤。　運素稱滑稽之雄，生丁變亂，以詼諧掩飾其無窮悲憤哀怨，喜笑怒駡，皆成文章。迹其本心，則尚論古人者當爲之深致惋惜也。其平生逸事至夥，時賢多能言之，此不著。</p>
<h3>金山的中冷泉</h3>
<p>— 水青</p>
<p>金山有中泠泉，這種泉水用來泡茶喝，在從前是天下聞名的。這泉大槪在金山山下南面的地方，現在已經不大容易找得到了；至於金山寺裏有一口井，呌做「天下第一泉」，却決不是天下聞名第一的中泠泉，只是和尚爲了敷衍普通游客，才由這個來冒充的。據說要是眞有特殊的貴客來到，知尚才肯用眞正的中泠泉水來烹茶待客。所謂「茶，泡茶，泡好茶，泡我的好茶，」（註）和尚待客本來是看人應付的。</p>
<p>據新煎茶水記有這樣一段故事：「代宗（唐）朝，李秀卿刺湖州，至維揚，逢陸處士鴻漸。李素熟陸名，因赴郡，抵揚子驛；將食，李日：「陸君善於茶，蓋天下聞名矣，况揚子南零水（即中泠泉水）又殊絕二妙，千載一遇，可嚝之乎？」命軍士挈瓶操舟，深詣南零；陸執器俟之。俄水至，以杓揚其水，日：「江則江矣，非南零者。」旣而傾諸盆，至半，陸遽止之曰，「此南零者矣。」軍士大駭，跽日：「齎至南零，舟蕩水覆，懼其尠，浥岸水增之；處士神鑒也，英敢隱焉。」這眞是神乎其神的事，無怪這位陸處主要被後世奉爲茶聖了。他連兩種水混合在一起以後，還能辨得出那是什麽水，而對金山中泠水研究得如此之精。</p>
<p>中泠泉水究竟是何味道？據說是「輕淸香滑，旣甘且冽」的；如果甘而不冽，則絕非中泠泉水。淸代乾隆皇帝遊金山時，他就曾做了一首「試中泠泉」的詩來稱道一番。</p>
<p>此外在太平廣記上還有一段神奇的故事：唐朝當李德裕做宰相的時候，有位要好的朋友出差到鎭江，李請他在回去時帶一瓶金山下的中泠泉水回去。此人等到在鎭江公事完畢之日，開船回去，吃醉了酒把這回事忘記了。一直等到船開至南京，大槪酒已經醒了，才想起當朝宰相李德裕託他的事。但是船已到南京，又不便再向回開，就在南京江中取了一瓶水，帶到長安，送給李德裕，以爲可以卸責了。不料李德裕暍了這水煮的茶，歎口氣說：「頗似建業石城下水！」此人無法開　，只好謝過·——李　　似乎也很精明，他　鎭江與南京底水味都能辨得出，但由此也可見他們對於吃茶一道如何精研的了。</p>
<p>中泠泉水不要說現在　客知道的很少，即在金山寺裏恐怕也只有少數的和尚才知道，因爲他們久而久之也只曉得「天下第一泉」的那口井了。</p>
<p>（註）這是鄭板織臘者年義堯的故事：據說他初遊山時，方丈還不知道他底大名，只當做普通客人看待，後來逐漸知道不是尋常人物，一直到知道他底大名時，才特別恭維。因此他臨走時送這方丈一副對聯，叫做「坐，請坐，請上坐，請先生上坐；茶，泡茶，泡好茶，泡我的好茶。」表示方丈和尚待客有四等階級。</p>
<h3>隱身術</h3>
<p>— 方萍</p>
<p>幼時讀神怪小說，最覺　往和羨慕的便是隱身術。用一張神符，或是念幾句咒語，便能在他人的肉眼前任所欲爲：殺了仇人，拿了珠賽，偷吻了　中美女，而旁人却一無所睹，莫明其妙，眞是「妙哉」「快哉」之至。因此幼時時常在夜裏做起碰着神仙傳授隱身術的怪夢。後來年事日長，漸漸明白所謂「隱身術」者，只不過是小說家的一種荒唐的假想，世界上是決沒有一個能將肉體隱掉的人的。結果，「隱身術」在幼時印在我腦中的金印便很快的褪色了。</p>
<p>可是，最近我翻閱英文科學雜誌，無意中發現一則科學珍聞，說是「隱身術」已變成千眞萬確的事實了。當時我眞有點說不出的驚奇，但也許是由於知識程度較前爲高的緣故，「懷疑」立刻就在我心中向驚奇挑戰起來，因此我就隨手將它意譯了出來，以便讓科學界人士來指明它是眞是假，是可能，還是不可能。下面就是那個「珍聞」：</p>
<p>意大利科學家曼斯尼敎授新近發明了一種能隱掉人體一切的光，它不但能像愛克斯光一樣的透射過人體的肌肉，而且更　進一步的透射過人體內的骨骼。這種光，曼斯尼敎授暫名之爲「曼斯尼光一。</p>
<p>某日，受斯尼敎授請了幾位名科學家來他家共膳。正在賓客們一一入座完畢時，大家都不由一齊的驚喊了出來，因爲每個人都忽然不見了身旁同桌的其他客人，而覺得只有自己一個人孤單的坐着。但不到三分鐘，這怪象就消失了，賓客們弄得莫明其妙，直等到主人笑嘻嘻的說出他在實驗他的新發明時，大家才恍然大悟。第二天，好多家報紙便刊出了這「奇聞」。</p>
<p>據曼斯尼敎授稱，這種隱身光是一種與鑐錠同類的放射性元素所放射出來的。他曾作了好多次實驗。其中最驚人的是有一次當桌旁的坐椅都歷歷在目時，椅上的衣服却忽然不見了。</p>
<p>假如這一個「珍聞」果眞是確確　鑿的事實，等到人人一旦都用起「曼斯尼光」來倫盜，行兇，甚至戰爭時，那麼這世界眞是不堪想像了。</p>
<h3>換羊書</h3>
<p>書家爲人揮寫，例有潤筆，潤筆的物品，在現代都是酬以錢幣。淸代鄭板橋自訂的潤例，即是每件白銀若干兩。但也有不以書法換取金錢的，如王右軍爲山陰道士寫道德經，換來潔白可愛的羣鵝，自亦有其價値。宋時有韓宗儒者，他是一位性嗜肉食的老　，他每得到東坡一帖，便換得羊肉數斤食之。黃魯直戯謂東坡道名：昔王右軍字爲摸　　，今宗儒以公書換取羊肉，可名公書爲換羊書矣。有一天，東坡在翰苑裏，正在撰製紛忙，宗僑作了一簡，以圖報答，似想得到東坡一帖的回答，來人督索得甚急，東坡笑着道。「傳語本官，今日斷屠。」東坡之幽默，可以傳矣。（筱彭）</p>

<h3>青雷學圖</h3>
<p>廿一日的下午，苜都國代大會輪到女代表沈女士主席，據此間報紙所載「花絮」云：沈執法甚嚴而客氣異常，連稱「謝謝」，「對不起」，眞是禮多人不怪，能把握代表心理等語。以愚所知，如此態度，如此謙抑的詞句，學界朋友，往往有之，亦不止只女性爲然。</p>
<p>凡受過西式敎育或與歐美知識份子相習者，皆知友朋款接之問，有當然的禮貌，即有常用之語詞。人有所益則曰Thankyou，己有所歉則曰Excuseme。不須計及事之大小輕重，即略有些微關係的言語行動，均應常備此種口頭用語。雖師長對於學生亦然。昔在學校，英文敎師Whittick先生對同學，即常用此二語，並敎導同學們關於禮節之應知事項。吾等雖不一一遵行（原因是除對先生外，舊習的環境中，並不需要，若驟然仿行於素不相習之人，反致詫異），但已稔知而　憶之矣。又中國長官與西人敎員應酬時，吾等每爲轉譯，又常常感覺「達意」之困難。有時在一方面爲敬詞，在對方或爲漫語。有時在此爲極熟之語，在彼則生硬費解。正因担任此種轉譯之故，留心兩邊詞句之異同而考校參訂，故於華語之兼有西式口氣者，有所聞見，不難辨明其來歷。</p>

<p>此電中之沈代表曾受過何等敎育，及其平素舉止，固非遠道所得而知，但設想知是留學生或久習於西式禮貌之人，則其所謂「謝謝」所謂「對不起」之口頭語詞，乃款接或聚會塲中之常例，未足爲異。試從別方面注意，當可發現許多。世所共知之胡適之博士，即永抱　謙雅度，雖極小之節目，亦常聞「謝謝」「對不起」之聲。梅畹華博士素行　抑，自游美歸國，並常接待外賓，其動止周旋，已究全西式的Gentleman風度，口語詞氣類此者亦處處可騐，所謂習慣成自然也。</p>

<h3>The National Assembly Holds its Fourth Vote; Vice President to be Elected Today; Li and Sun Exert All Efforts to Win Votes</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 28th] The election of the Vice President is likely to reach its final result by noon on the 29th. After three rounds of voting among the six candidates, only Li Zongren and Sun Ke remain to participate in the fourth election on the 29th. This election will elect the candidate with the most votes, regardless of whether they exceed half the total. Unless the two candidates receive the same number of votes, in which case a fifth election will be held, the victor will be decided. The Presidium of the National Assembly held its forty-first meeting on the evening of the 28th. Chairman Zhang Zhenlu decided that the fourth Vice Presidential election would be held on the morning of the 29th, with Representative Yu Bin serving as chairman of the Assembly. The Vice Presidential ballots were printed on the afternoon of the 28th, using the same format as before. This time they are white paper with red characters, listing the names of Vice Presidential candidates Li Zongren and Sun Ke. On the evening of the 28th, Qian Dajun, Ma Wenche, and Li Zhongyang were appointed by the Presidium to supervise the sealing and safekeeping of the ballots. They will be unsealed in public on the morning of the 29th. One hundred and ten inspectors for the Assembly on the 29th have been drawn by lot, including Chen Yuguang and Zeng Baosun.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 28th] The Vice Presidential election has reached a critical juncture on the 29th. Candidates Li Zongren and Sun Ke will compete in the final round of the fourth Vice Presidential election. The voting results of the representatives will determine the fate of Li and Sun. Therefore, both sides exerted all efforts to win votes on the 28th. In particular, the representatives from Hunan, Hubei, Sichuan, and Henan, who originally supported Cheng Qian, have become the main target of both sides' propaganda efforts. In the third election on the 28th, apart from Cheng Qian withdrawing from the final round because his vote count still ranked third, the votes for Li and Sun each had their own strengths and weaknesses. Li received 1163 votes in the second round of voting on the 24th, and 1156 votes in the third round of voting on the 28th, a decrease of seven votes. However, 2744 ballots were issued in the third round, and 2735 votes were cast, fewer than the 2765 ballots issued and 2760 votes cast in the second round on the 24th. Therefore, the reason for the decrease in Li's votes is likely due to the lower attendance. Sun received 1040 votes on the 28th, an increase of 95 votes compared to the 945 votes on the 24th. The vote counts for Li and Sun on the 28th were very close. Since only a plurality is required to win in the fourth vote on the 29th, and it is not necessary to exceed half the total number of representatives, even a single vote is worth fighting for. The Li and Sun campaign teams were active throughout the 28th, soliciting votes from the representatives. Li's wife, Guo Dejie, and Sun's wife, Chen Shuying, also spent the entire day campaigning. At 6:30 PM, Sun Ke hosted a banquet for representatives from Hunan and Hubei at the Legislative Yuan, delivering a speech on his political views, hoping that the representatives from Hunan and Hubei would support him so that he could be elected and realize his political views. After Sun Ke's banquet, the representatives from Hunan and Hubei attended Li Zongren's tea party at 8:30 PM. During the gathering, Li also delivered a speech, emphasizing that his proposed political reforms were the same as Cheng Qian's reform ideas, hoping that the representatives from Hunan and Hubei would transfer their enthusiasm for supporting Cheng to supporting his election. Sun Ke also scheduled a morning tea for representatives from Henan at 8:00 AM on the 29th, urging them to help him vote. Until late at night on the 28th, campaign workers from both sides were still visiting the residences of the representatives. The results of their activities will be concretely reflected in the voting records on the 29th.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 28th] The Presidium of the Assembly discussed the certificates of election for the President and Vice President at a meeting on the evening of the 28th and decided to present them on the morning of May 1st. The presentation ceremony will be held in the Assembly Hall. In addition to Yu Youren, who was previously scheduled to present the certificate, Hu Shi and Yu Bin were appointed on the 28th to welcome the President and Vice President on that day. The Presidium also discussed the ceremony for the presentation of the certificates at the meeting on the 28th, but it still needs to be submitted to the Assembly for approval. The Presidium is scheduled to hold another Assembly meeting on the morning of the 30th to discuss the unfinished proposals and the issues of permanent institutions. If progress is smooth, it can be adjourned in the afternoon of the 1st. However, the final confirmation will depend on the outcome of the Vice Presidential election on the 29th.</p>
<h3>Third Vote Proceeds Smoothly; None of the Three Candidates Receives the Required Legal Majority; Fourth Election to be Held Today with Li and Sun as Candidates</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 28th] The National Assembly held its third Vice Presidential election on the morning of the 28th, proceeding smoothly with the vote. However, the number of votes received by all three Vice Presidential candidates did not reach the required majority. Li Zongren received 1156 votes, Sun Ke received 1040 votes, and Cheng Qian received 515 votes. According to the provisions of the Election and Recall Law, a fourth vote should be held between the top two candidates, with each representative selecting one of them. The Assembly on the 28th was held at 9:35 AM, with Hu Shi presiding. 2744 representatives were present. Secretary-General Hong Lanyou first read two reports from the Presidium: (1) The results of the second re-election of the Vice President on the 24th showed that none of the Vice Presidential candidates, Li Zongren, Sun Ke, and Cheng Qian, received the legally required majority of votes. According to the provisions of Article 4, Paragraph 3, Item 2 of the Presidential and Vice Presidential Election and Recall Law, a third vote should be held to select one candidate. (2) The Presidium successively received requests from Vice Presidential candidates Cheng Qian, Li Zongren, and Sun Ke to renounce their qualifications as Vice Presidential candidates. The Presidium decided at its 36th meeting to recommend to the five representatives Hu Shi, Yu Bin, Zeng Baosun, Chen Qitian, and Sun Yaofu that the three Vice Presidential candidates continue their campaigns. Representative Yu Bin was appointed to report the results of the interviews. Yu Bin then reported on the process, stating that on the 25th of this month, the Presidium received requests from Mr. Li, Mr. Sun, and Mr. Cheng to renounce their qualifications as Vice Presidential candidates. The Presidium discussed this at its 36th meeting, believing that each candidate had been nominated by hundreds of people. The election was already underway and had reached the third vote. In order to ensure the smooth progress of the Assembly, five representatives were appointed to visit the three candidates and persuade them to continue. The results were very good, and all three candidates no longer insisted on renouncing their candidacy. Therefore, the Presidium decided to hold the third Vice Presidential election today. Chairman Hu Shi stated: "Mr. Yu Bin has reported on the process on behalf of the Presidium and explained the Presidium's views. Can the Assembly no longer consider this and proceed with the election process?" The motion was passed with applause. The Chairman announced that today's Assembly would be changed to the third Vice Presidential election. He then asked Bai Chongxi, a representative of the Presidium, to report on the temporary proposals regarding the order of the election. Mr. Bai then announced a temporary proposal from 823 people, which stated that effective measures should be taken to prevent manipulation, control, and threats to the election, and that Chairman Chiang should be invited to report to the Assembly on the methods for a free election for the Vice President. Mr. Bai further explained that voting in the Assembly was absolutely free, ballots must be folded, and not shown to others. He also said: "Chairman Chiang has personally instructed me to explain that he completely supports the representatives voting according to their free will. I hereby convey this to all representatives. At this critical moment of suppressing the rebellion, I hope that the Assembly can be successfully completed, and that everyone can return to their original posts and engage in suppressing the rebellion." After Mr. Bai's report, the Secretary-General reported on the election procedures and the names of those responsible for monitoring the voting and counting. By 10:30 AM, all procedures had been prepared, and voting began. At 11:01 AM, voting was completed. At 11:40 AM, the ballots were opened. At 1:11 PM, the opening of the twelve ballot boxes was completed. A total of 2744 ballots were issued, and 2735 votes were cast, including 24 invalid votes. The total number of valid votes was 2711. The Chairman reported the results, stating: "According to the voting results today, Li Zongren received the most votes, with 1156 votes, followed by Sun Ke with 1040 votes, and Cheng Qian with 515 votes. According to the Election and Recall Law, none of the candidates received a majority, and a Vice President cannot be produced. A fourth vote should be held, with the two candidates receiving the most votes in today's vote as candidates, and one of them selected." The fourth vote was scheduled for 9:00 AM on the following day. After Mr. Hu's report, he announced the adjournment of the meeting.</p>
<h3>Failure in the Election, Victory in Morality; Cheng Qian Thanks Voters in the Peacock Hall, Expressing His Feelings</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 28th] At 6:00 PM on the 28th, more than 600 National Assembly representatives and members of Cheng Qian's campaign team who supported Cheng Qian's election gathered in the Peacock Hall of the Central Hotel. Cheng entered the hall amidst enthusiastic applause and delivered an impromptu speech, saying: "This election has been fully supported by the representatives, which can be said to be entirely out of a sense of justice and a true vote of conscience. The results of the third election on the 28th were within my expectations, but my only wish was for the smooth progress of the Assembly, so I reluctantly agreed to run. Although I received few votes today, I still consider it the greatest honor and pleasure. I express my heartfelt gratitude to the representatives for their enthusiastic support today. After today's election, some friends have asked me how they should vote tomorrow. I have told them all to follow the principle of free voting and cast their sacred vote for the candidate who is closest to their ideals. I personally will do the same. I have views and opinions on politics. All of you present today are my friends of morality and adversity. I would like to invite you again after the Assembly adjourns to exchange views on the current situation." After Cheng's speech, Tang Shizun and Zhao Hengti delivered speeches, both emphasizing that Cheng Qian's appeal this time was based on moral character. Although he had failed in the election battle, he had won in the moral battle, and the future would be the beginning of the struggle for morality.</p>

<h3>National Assembly Chronicles: After the Rain, the Sky Clears, the Election Tide Calms Down - Who Will Be the Vice President? To Be Continued...</h3>
<p>[Special Correspondent] The Vice Presidential election is the climax of the entire agenda of this National Assembly. The joint statement by the three Vice Presidential candidates renouncing their campaigns is the peak of this climax. However, the handling of this peak was done with a rather long period of cooling down. The unpredictable twists and turns of the past three days have been clearly explained through this highly skilled cooling down process. The Assembly on the 28th was finally able to proceed smoothly, giving people a subtle feeling of hope after despair.</p>
<p>Looking back at what happened in the past three days, it is like a dream. The depression of dark clouds without rain, the tension of tightened heartstrings, the suspicion of shifting east and west, and the rumors flying around could hardly be found in the Assembly hall on the 28th. The weather was gentle and sunny, the clear sky was without a trace of clouds. The magnificent Assembly hall was still reflected in the national flag, and the cars and horses at the door were as busy as ever. General Li Zongren and his wife, Guo Dejie, stood shoulder to shoulder on the steps in front of the main entrance, while the wife of President Sun stood on the right side of the second entrance. They all smiled and shook hands with the attendees, greeting them and thanking them. Except for the lack of intense emotions, everything was the same as the day before yesterday. The representatives in the Assembly hall were also leisurely chatting with acquaintances or sitting alone reading newspapers. Not a single piece of propaganda was seen, and no one even mentioned the cooling down of the past two days. The common topic was:</p>
<p>"How have you been spending the past two days?"</p>
<p>But at the beginning of the meeting, it was almost unbelievable. In fact, this relaxed exterior still concealed a tense heart. "Has something happened?" "Can the election be successfully completed?" Everyone was apprehensive. The Assembly was like a ship sailing through a winding canyon. There were visible tree stumps and rocks, and invisible weeds and reefs. But thanks to the good pilots, they managed to navigate this course smoothly. The Vice Presidential election safely entered the final stage.</p>
<p>The Chairman of the Assembly was President Hu Shi. He and Secretary-General Hong Lanyou carefully and calmly maintained the order of the meeting and the progress of the conference. The first to report on behalf of the Presidium was Bishop Yu Bin. He clearly reported that the meeting had been adjourned for the past two days due to the fact that the three Vice Presidential candidates had successively declared their renunciation of the campaign. However, after the Presidium sent representatives to persuade them, the problem had been resolved. The Presidium then decided to continue with the third election, without further discussion by the Assembly. This decision was solemnly requested by Chairman Hu to be agreed upon by the Assembly, and it passed the first dangerous shoal amidst thunderous applause. Next, General Bai Chongxi reported on behalf of the Presidium on a temporary motion from more than 800 people. The motion was to request the Presidium to take effective measures to prevent manipulation, control, and threats to the election in the Assembly hall. This motion originally made many people sweat, worrying that it would cause a storm. But General Bai's report presented the results of the Presidium's consideration of the measures proposed in this motion, one by one. He said:</p>
<p>"The Presidium believes that there are absolutely no problems with voting in the Assembly hall. The election is absolutely free. Everyone should automatically protect their right to secrecy and not show their votes to others. As for outside the Assembly hall, Chairman Chiang has repeatedly stated that he absolutely supports all representatives voting according to their free will." He also believes that everyone hopes that the tasks of the Assembly can be completed smoothly as soon as possible so that they can go back to execute the suppression of rebellion.</p>
<p>At 9:55 AM, Chairman Hu announced that the third Vice Presidential election would be held. Secretary-General Hong and the staff of the Assembly demonstrated an even faster, more rigorous, and careful work ethic. Blotting paper was added to the writing rooms. "Representatives should walk on the main road" (according to a certain representative). "No Assembly hall staff member is allowed to stand," "Please do not whisper in the Assembly hall" (according to a certain representative), "The 'attachments' of the inspectors and female representatives can be temporarily stored on the podium." After Secretary-General Hong's repeated and detailed reports and explanations, a different order of districts was used than in the previous two elections. At 10:30 AM, voting began, and under the unprecedentedly excellent order, the entire voting time took only 50 minutes. By 11:30 AM, the ballot opening arrangements were completed. Five minutes later, Chairman Hu announced the start of the ballot opening. At this time, Liu Huan, the female representative who had been appointed to verify the ballots, refused to step onto the stage, but she finally relented amidst applause.</p>
<p>The twelve ballot boxes were opened. The first ballot was for Cheng Qian, followed by Sun Ke and Li Zongren side by side. Sun Ke took the lead in the first and second ballot boxes. Li Zongren took the lead in the third ballot box. Sun Ke rebounded in the sixth ballot box. Li Zongren's vote count dropped sharply in the seventh ballot box, but he still took the lead. This situation continued until the end. Li Zongren still took the lead in the third round, Sun Ke followed closely, and Cheng Qian was far behind. The situation was very clear: Li Zongren's situation remained the same, Sun Ke was improving day by day, and some of Cheng Qian's voters had followed Sun Ke. In general, Li Zongren and Sun Ke were in close combat. After Chairman Hu announced at 1:20 PM that the fourth Vice Presidential election would be held tomorrow, everyone was thinking:</p>
<p>"Who will be the victor tomorrow?" (April 28th, Nanjing)</p>
<h3>National Assembly Delegate Shi Changbi, Who Lost the Election, Went on a Hunger Strike and Was Sent to the Hospital for Recuperation, but Disappeared; Spokesperson of the Ministry of the Interior Clarifies the Truth</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 28th] The spokesperson of the Ministry of the Interior stated: "Mr. Shi Changbi was a National Assembly delegate candidate nominated by a political party for Qianyang County, Hunan Province. As a result of the election, he received a relatively small number of votes. Before and after the National Assembly convened, he repeatedly came to the Ministry of the Interior to meet with Minister Zhang. On the 7th of this month, Shi walked into the Minister's office on his own. After being greeted and asked to wait until the Minister arrived, Shi announced that he would go on a hunger strike and refused to leave the office. The Ministry sent personnel to persuade him earnestly, but to no avail. We then persuaded him to eat and prepared milk, biscuits, tea, and water for him to eat from time to time. By the next day, he was eating normally and even personally wrote out a menu, ordering the workers to prepare it, which became his daily routine. Later, the Ministry set up a bed and provided him with a quilt so that he could rest comfortably. However, on the 19th of this month, Shi Changbi suddenly announced another hunger strike (but still ate delicious dishes and drank water) and presented Minister Zhang with written conditions: (A) Immediately stop Pan Zhuangfei from attending the National Assembly and publish a statement of facts, ordering a re-election and issuing a certificate of election based on the results of the re-election; (B) Send him abroad to study and implement the National Assembly distribution method proposed by the Central Government, etc. On the 23rd, he personally proposed: (A) Guarantee his appointment as Vice Chairman or Secretary-General of the War Suppression and Nation Building Committee and announce it within days, otherwise Comrade Shi will request fulfillment in any way; (B) Subsidize Comrade Shi with 400 million yuan. If the Central Government has a subsidy, it will be tripled according to the Central Government's regulations, and an additional 50 million yuan will be provided for hospital treatment; (C) The method for Comrade Shi to serve as a National Assembly delegate for four years after his appointment will still be implemented; (D) Punish Pan Zhuangfei, at least preventing him from serving as a member of the War Suppression and Nation Building Committee or other positions, etc. The above conditions also require Minister Zhang to sign, and there is also a statement that 'Do not turn this short-term issue into a lifelong entanglement between us, so that I will come to disturb your peace of mind at any time in the future,' etc. Because Shi claimed to be on a hunger strike when he first arrived at the Ministry, although he did not actually do so, in order to determine responsibility, our colleagues discussed asking the Nan District Police Department to send personnel to serve him to prevent accidents. His daily life, the letters he sent, and the guests he met are all recorded by the police. Later, on the 24th of this month, Shi expressed his wish to be hospitalized for recuperation. The director of the Nan District Police Department, Mr. Shu, and our colleagues persuaded him to move to the Central Hospital for recuperation and sent him to the Central Hospital by car on the same day, opening room 414. Today, we received an official letter from the Central Hospital on the 26th, which stated that 'Yesterday at 3:30 PM and 3:35 PM, the doctor went to administer injections and examinations twice, but both times he refused. After reporting to the Director of Internal Medicine, we went to see him again at 3:45 PM and found that Mr. Shi was no longer in the room, and the accompanying staff were also looking for him.' According to our investigation, Shi's personal actions were very free when he was in the Ministry, going to various offices to find people and make phone calls. In the hospital, his personal freedom of action was still unrestricted. We are afraid that the outside world does not understand the truth, so we declare the details as above."</p>
<h3>Fierce Street Fighting in Weixian</h3>
<p>Reinforcements Cross Yidu and Continue Eastward</p>
<p>[Our Jinan Correspondent, 28th] In Weixian East City, from the 27th to the 28th, for 24 hours, the defending troops were still engaged in fierce street fighting with the invading Communist bandits. The troops attacking from Changle, in conjunction with the Air Force, made considerable gains. The reinforcements advancing eastward crossed Yidu on the 28th and continued eastward. They may join forces with the troops attacking from Changle near Yangjiazhuang on the evening of the 28th. The two wings of the eastward advancing troops are rapidly sweeping south of Yidu and northeast of Linzi.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 28th] Weixian is in danger. Shandong has urgently telegraphed National Assembly representatives from Shandong in Beijing for help, requesting that the reinforcements that have crossed Yidu advance quickly. It is reported that the National Army defending Weixian has broken through the siege. The local troops led by Zhang Tianzuo and others, after many days of hard fighting, have only about 1,000 people left and have suffered heavy losses.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Qingdao, 28th] The main force of the bandit's 13th Column, 37th and 38th Divisions, which was besieged by the National Army in Nanbei Shaling (Pingdu County), broke through the siege on the afternoon of the 27th and fled north. A certain Brigade Commander led his troops in a fierce pursuit. The entire 117th Regiment of the bandit's 38th Division was annihilated near Nan Shaling. As of the time of the dispatch, more than 300 bandits below the battalion commander level had been captured, and more than 10 heavy machine guns, 10 mortars, and more than 300 rifles had been seized.</p>
<h3>Communist Army in Northern Chahar Retreats Completely</h3>
<p>[Our Beiping Correspondent, 28th] The North China Suppression Headquarters reports: The Communist bandits disturbing Baochang and Duolun in northern Chahar have retreated completely. The National Army has arrived successively and is cooperating with local teams to encircle and suppress them along the Duolun County border. More than 500 bandits retreating southeast from Baochang began to retreat in separate groups to the southeast this morning. More than 200 were killed or wounded by the Air Force's strafing on the 27th.</p>
<h3>37 Villages and Towns Captured Along the Pingjin Highway</h3>
<p>[Our Beiping Correspondent, 28th] The remaining bandits along the Pingjin Highway have been cleared. The National Army launched a pincer attack yesterday and the day before, recovering 37 villages and towns along the line. The road surface has been severely damaged and is being repaired.</p>
<h3>The "Arctic" Vessel Escapes Danger and Safely Arrives at Huludao</h3>
<p>[Our Shenyang Correspondent, 28th] The "Arctic" warship, which was captured by bandits in the Yingkou battle, safely escaped danger on the 26th and arrived at Huludao. After leaving Yingkou, the ship ran aground at the mouth of the Liao River. It was later rescued by the "Chang Sheng" and "Yong Zhi" ships. The rumor that the "Arctic" was destroyed is inaccurate.</p>
<h3>Liu Bocheng Rumored to be Injured</h3>
<p>[Our Xinyang Correspondent, 28th] It is rumored that Liu Bocheng was seriously injured on the Huaihai front line and is currently being treated in Guchengzhai.</p>
<h3>Yu Youren's Birthday is Filled with Guests; Chairman Chiang and His Wife Personally Offer Congratulations; The Birthday Celebrant Visited Tangshan Yesterday in High Spirits</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 28th] The President of the Control Yuan, Yu Youren, celebrated his 70th birthday on the 28th. From 7:00 AM, well-wishers arrived one after another. Chairman Chiang and his wife went to his residence in person at 11:00 AM to offer their congratulations. At that time, the courtyard was crowded with guests. Chairman Chiang and his wife walked slowly across the lawn, congratulated Yu amidst the crowd, and took a photo to commemorate the occasion. They then entered the birthday hall for a short rest, staying for about 20 minutes before leaving. Yu's residence was filled with joy today. Wu Dingchang, Sun Ke, and others sent valuable flower baskets, which were displayed in the room. The birthday hall was simply decorated, with Chairman Chiang's congratulatory message in the center, and congratulatory items from Ju Zheng, Dai Chuanxian, Zhang Qun, Sun Ke, and Chen Bulei hung all around. Today's guests included party, government, and military leaders in the capital, as well as National Assembly representatives, totaling no less than 3,000 people. Yu personally greeted the guests and took photos with them frequently. At about 2:00 PM, feeling tired from the greetings, he drove to Tangshan for a short visit, strolling among the beautiful scenery, in high spirits, and returned at 6:00 PM. While Yu was on his outing, many guests continued to arrive, and they were greeted by the Secretary-General of the Control Yuan, Li Chongxian, and others, who provided tea and refreshments. The number of guests today was unprecedented. This is not only because Yu is a founding member of the party and the country, but also because of the demeanor of a democratic statesman that he has displayed since participating in the Vice Presidential election, which is especially admirable. As the birthday couplet presented by Mr. and Mrs. Bu Lizi said: "His demeanor is truly democratic, his spirit is of an old man but as young as youth."</p>
<h3>The Communist Bandits Within Baoji Are Eliminated; Qishan and Fengxiang Are Both Recovered; In the Battle of Bin County, an Entire Regiment of Bandits Surrenders</h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent, Xi'an, 28th] The National Army, advancing westward along the highway from Fufeng, crossed Yidian Town and recovered Qishan County seat on the evening of the 27th. It is continuing to push westward smoothly, with advanced units already entering the territories of Fengxiang and Baoji counties.</p>
<p>[Our Correspondent, Lanzhou, 28th] The National Army is progressing rapidly on the Xi'an-Lanzhou Highway, and the highway between Xi'an and Yongshou is clear and unblocked.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Xi'an, 8th] The National Army advancing westward along both sides of the Longhai Railway is progressing rapidly. On the evening of the 27th, they captured Qishan County seat and Caijiapo in the industrial district. They then took advantage of their momentum and advanced rapidly, capturing Tongzhen and Fengxiang in succession on the morning of the 28th. Baoji, an important town in western Shaanxi that had been temporarily harassed by bandits, has also been completely secured by the National Army, turning danger into safety. The bandits in these areas, under the sweep of our large army, are like fallen leaves in the autumn wind, with heavy casualties. It is estimated that over 20,000 bandits have been annihilated by the National Army in recent days. Having suffered such a heavy blow, the bandits are terrified and are now fleeing blindly towards the northwest. The National Army is pursuing and intercepting them along multiple routes, and is continuing to expand its gains.</p>
<p>[Further Telegram] After the communist bandits in Baoji were completely eliminated by the National Army, there are no longer any traces of bandits along the entire line from Longxi to Baoji. The Railway Bureau has issued an order to rush the repair of the road and to restore traffic as soon as possible. Traffic was restored to Wugong on the 28th, and is expected to extend to Jiangzhang on the 29th.</p>
<p>[Our Correspondent, Lanzhou, 28th] In the battle of Bin County, a cavalry unit of a certain reorganized division in eastern Gansu defeated the main force of the Sixth Column of communist bandits and parts of the First and Fourth Columns. An entire regiment of the Sixth Column of communist bandits surrendered to our forces, and over one hundred pieces of heavy weaponry, new weapons, communications equipment, and countless light and heavy weapons were seized. The two National Army forces that joined forces in Bin County are currently clearing the battlefield and pursuing the remaining bandits. The retreat route of the remaining bandits on the south bank of the Jing River has been clearly cut off, and it will not be difficult to wipe them out in one fell swoop. The bandits have been eliminated and order has been restored in Fufeng, Yongshou, Wugong, Qian County, and Liquan counties, and righteous people are returning to their hometowns one after another. A certain military observer praised the battle of Bin County as the beginning of stabilizing the Northwest.</p>
<p>[Our Correspondent, Xi'an, 28th] The Air Force Third Military District Headquarters announced at 6:00 PM that our Air Force launched sorties from dawn to dusk on the 28th to assist in the fighting at the front. Powerful formations of aircraft fiercely attacked the bandits east of the Luo River and covered our army's advance westward from Hengshui (west of Qishan). Our aircraft discovered our army engaged in fierce fighting with the bandits on a mountain range seven kilometers west of Huanglong Mountain. They immediately bombed and strafed the bandit concentrations, killing over 500 bandits. Our aircraft also strafed over one hundred bandit cavalrymen on a road ten kilometers northwest of Chengcheng, and over a thousand bandits and over one hundred vehicles, fully loaded with supplies and heading west, on the highway west of Yangcheng. Upon discovery by our aircraft, they were bombed and strafed, and the bandits suffered heavy losses.</p>

<h3>Rescuing the Crisis in Northeast Education</h3>
<p>The war clouds over the Northeast have recently tended to subside, but they are still amidst ominous calm and frequent alarms of war. The suffering of our compatriots in the Northeast is very distressing. The maintenance of education in the Northeast, as well as the reception of young people fleeing from evacuated cities, deserves our concern. The education proposals in the recent National Assembly also included suggestions for rescuing displaced students. As we look at the current education in the Northeast, it is not just a matter of rescuing those who have lost their schooling.</p>
<p>Last month, Huang Zengming, chief inspector of the Ministry of Education, was ordered to inspect education in the Northeast, including Shenyang and Changchun. He has been back in Nanjing for a month, but the rumored plan of the Ministry of Education to establish schools in Beiping to accommodate young people from evacuated middle schools and universities in the Northeast has not yet materialized. We have not seen Huang's full report, but based on the news revealed in the newspapers and the reports from our correspondent in Shenyang over the past two months, the current state of education in the National Army-controlled areas of the Northeast is precarious.</p>
<p>The overall situation of the country is difficult, and the entire education system has been directly and indirectly affected, requiring comprehensive rescue and solutions. However, rescuing the crisis in Northeast education is a fundamental matter related to the lifeline of our education and the future of the nation. It should be observed with special consideration and planned separately. The Ministry of Education bears the responsibility for the education and culture of the country and should not only engage in dealing with minor or local issues but should also consider the entire long-term strategy. What was the point of the eight-year War of Resistance? To recover sovereignty and restore territory. The object of this recovery of lost territory is the Northeast, which was occupied for fourteen years after the September 18th Incident and returned to the embrace of the motherland after victory. Today, the communist bandits are occupying parts of China, but this is a temporary phenomenon. If the education authorities disregard Northeast education, it will be a sign that our government is neglecting this vast territory and would also diminish the sacred significance of China's War of Resistance. Therefore, the government authorities and people from all walks of life must jointly devote all their efforts to rescuing the crisis in Northeast education.</p>
<p>First, regarding higher education: we advocate that Northeast University, which is on the "edge of the battlefield," should complete its relocation to Beiping before the summer vacation. This does not mean that the National Army is preparing to withdraw from Shenyang, but on the contrary, to cooperate with the National Army's planned defense and offensive, Shenyang temporarily lacks a stable environment in which higher education can be conducted. It is said that the current situation is that relocation and non-relocation are equally difficult, with economic factors being the main concern. However, based on past experience during the War of Resistance and international opinion, only relocation to a more stable area can maintain its development. As for colleges and universities, some departments that can cooperate with the suppression of communist military affairs can allow students to voluntarily remain or be transferred to the front lines to assist in the suppression of the rebellion (such as political work, or defense works, or industrial and mining recovery). For Northeast University or the Northeast Temporary United University after relocation, the first thing to do is to strictly screen students' grades to re-determine their year level, being strict rather than lenient. Secondly, their equipment should be enriched, especially the facilities of the engineering school, which should be based on the principle of meeting the needs of restoring Northeast's industrial construction because higher education creates specialists and must focus on the long-term future. In addition, young people in the Northeast were controlled by the enemy's and puppet's policy of misleading the people during the war. Their knowledge of the country's language, history, and geography is either low or wrong. Therefore, common prerequisite courses must always strengthen the teachers and teaching materials of literature and history education. As for the issue of transferring and boarding for students from Northeast colleges and universities, due to the limitation of their level, they should not hesitate to demote them, and public and private universities in Beiping and Tianjin should have a sympathetic attitude and consider accepting them appropriately.</p>
<p>Secondly, regarding primary and secondary education, according to a Shenyang telegram from our newspaper on March 10, it said: "Secondary schools cannot escape the nature of relief, with few schools and many students," and "Primary schools are poor, and national education is almost entirely abandoned." We can hardly imagine the actual situation of primary and secondary education in various places in the Northeast. The education in the areas occupied by the communist bandits is even more unbearable to mention. Even if the above report is an exaggeration, the severity of the schools' teachers and funding in the Northeast amidst soaring prices must be ten times greater than that of Nanjing and Shanghai. National education in the Northeast is precisely to re-educate "new citizens" for the country to replace and correct the past absurd education of the Japanese puppets and to lay a new foundation for the country's political recovery. With such an important mission and the current situation like this, this is not just an educational problem. We urge the Northeast military and political authorities to face the reality, plan for the future, and request the central government and raise huge funds locally to retain a large number of capable and knowledgeable people to stay and manage national education, especially instilling national consciousness, the results of the War of Resistance, and the solemn significance of the suppression of the rebellion, so that thriving primary school students can understand right and wrong, and become cadres who will rebuild the Northeast in the future and truly patriotic citizens. Secondary education should also adhere to the principle of "rather have less than have inferior," screen, merge, and improve teachers, and for the need to adapt to future construction, prevent the contradiction between further education and employment, and should develop various different secondary vocational education from the perspective of adapting to local conditions. As for how to supply nationally approved teaching materials, facilitate the transportation and publication of beneficial books and periodicals, and ban low-level and reactionary publications to assist in the development of sound popular education, it is also equally dependent on the central education authorities' guidance and assistance, and is not only the local authorities' unshirkable task.</p>
<p>Finally, there is one more point that I would like to simply express for the people of the Northeast: from the historical and geographical conditions, especially after the painful experience of more than 20 years of Japanese puppet occupation, it has been clearly proven that the Northeast is an inseparable part of our entire China, and an independent China cannot exist without the Northeast. Therefore, the construction and revitalization of the Northeast must rely on the efforts of all Chinese people. Northeast education cannot be borne by the people of the nine provinces of the Northeast alone. Therefore, we must break the old concept of Northeast people running Northeast education themselves. To correct the old abuses and enrich the national consciousness, and to improve science to meet the needs of industrial recovery, we must break down barriers and welcome talents from all over the country to the Northeast to jointly undertake the great cause of cultivating talents and revitalizing the Northeast.</p>
<h3>Weng Wenhao and Others Host a Banquet for the U.S. Delegation; Propose Restrictions on Japanese Industry; North States That the Purpose of This Trip Is to Gather Information</h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent, Nanjing, 28th] Weng Wenhao and Chen Qitian jointly hosted a banquet on the evening of the 28th for the U.S. delegation dispatched by the Allied Headquarters to China to discuss Sino-Japanese trade, including North and his party. A meeting was held before the banquet. In addition to Weng Wenhao and Chen Qitian, the Chinese participants included Tong Jiling, Vice Minister of Economic Affairs, Zhang Tianze, Director of the International Trade Department, and Gu Baochang, Director of the Industry Department. Both Chen and Weng gave speeches during the banquet. When discussing the principles of Sino-Japanese trade, they proposed that the level of Japanese industry should be determined, especially that Japan's textile industry should be restricted. Tong Jiling also suggested that a few experts from China and a few experts from the United States should study the issue of restricting the level of Japanese industry in Tokyo to determine a level that Japanese industry should maintain. During his speech, Weng Wenhao proposed that Taiwan sugar and pig iron from our country could be exported to Japan. However, North and others stated that they were not experts in the area of trade and that their purpose in coming to China was only to exchange views and gather information, so they could not make any decisions.</p>

<h3>Soviet Newspaper Comments on Mo Teh-hui's Remarks on the Sino-Soviet Treaty</h3>
<p>[TASS, Moscow, 25th] Mo Teh-hui, convener of the Foreign Affairs Proposal Review (Third) Committee of the Chinese National Assembly, made remarks to the effect that the Sino-Soviet Treaty "has lost its meaning." An observer of "Pravda" commented, stating: "The Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship and Alliance, concluded on August 14, 1945, for a term of thirty years, was and continues to be aimed at preventing the resurgence of Japanese aggression and at mutual assistance in the event of such aggression. It is clear that this treaty is the foundation of China's independence and security."</p>
<p>"There is no doubt that the Chinese people and progressives attach great importance to this treaty, especially now that some people are sparing no effort to restore Japanese militarism and Japan's industrial war potential. The friendship and alliance between the Chinese and Soviet peoples is the foundation of peace and security in the Far East."</p>
<p>"The Chinese people cherish the friendship with the Soviet Union. The Chinese people believe that the Soviet Union is a powerful fighter for the maintenance of international peace and security."</p>

<h3>Liu Ronglin, a Police Officer at the Suzhou Station Road, Touches a Button on a Machine Gun, Killing Two Police Officers</h3>

<h3>Salaries and Income Taxes of Public Education, Military, and Police Personnel Will Be Resumed Starting in April</h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent, Nanjing, 28th] A spokesman for the Ministry of Finance recently talked about the taxation of salaries of public education personnel and said: The income tax on salaries of public education, military, and police personnel was originally levied based on base salary, and living allowances were not included. At that time, the income amount did not reach the taxation standard, so in fact it was equivalent to tax exemption. However, due to the exemption of income tax for public education personnel and employees of state-owned enterprises, the impact extended to general employees who all used this as an excuse not to pay taxes, resulting in huge losses in national tax revenue. Now the Income Tax Law has been revised and promulgated. The regulations on the starting point and tax rate for fixed salary income tax stipulate that the starting point is adjusted three times a year in April, July, and October according to the cost of living index of the Directorate-General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics. The starting point for this year's tax collection from April has been raised to 7.91 million yuan per month, and the tax rate has been reduced to 1%. Only those with a monthly income of over 52.74 million yuan will be subject to progressive tax on the excess part. The chief accountants of various agencies and enterprises or the persons in charge of various profit-making enterprises and other employers are responsible for withholding and paying the tax. At present, the monthly income of the highest-level specially appointed officials is less than 30 million yuan, so in addition to the 1% tax, there is no excess tax. The tax burden is small, but it is of great benefit to the treasury. This Ministry has submitted it to the Executive Yuan for approval and will resume the collection of income tax on the salaries of public education, military, and police personnel starting in April. At the same time, it has strictly ordered various bureaus to universally collect income tax on the salaries of employees in various industries, so as to evenly distribute the burden.</p>

<h3>Unveiling the Mystery of Mount積石: The Remaining Question Is How to Open the Door to the Natural Treasure House</h3>
<p>— Our Reporter Hong Xucai</p>
<p>[Our Special Report] "Mount積石 does not have high peaks; Mount Everest still holds the throne as the world's highest mountain." Since the Central Air Transport Corporation's exploration plane completed its mission, the mystery of Mount積石 has been unveiled, but people should not be satisfied with this, because exploration work should include various scientific studies and explorations. Mapping the terrain, measuring longitude and latitude, studying ancient glacier remains, and investigating geology, minerals, flora, fauna, races, languages, customs, etc., can fully realize the glory of this virgin land that has not been reclaimed!</p>
<p>This reporter participated in the Central Air Transport Corporation's exploration team and soared over Mount積石 for eleven hours. Afterwards, I visited several experts to ask about the theme of Mount積石. I would like to give a faithful report on the current situation of Mount積石 that I have seen with my own eyes.</p>
<p>Mount積石 is located in the border area of Qinghai, Gansu, and Xikang provinces. The Qinghai people call it Maqin Snow Mountain. 阿尼瑪卿 is a transliteration of the Tibetan language, meaning "lofty old man." The locals are superstitious and worship all mountains as "gods," and Mount 阿尼瑪卿 is considered "Buddha," the "ancestor who created the world."</p>
<p>Mount積石 has attracted attention because of its high altitude. It is also a historically famous mountain in China, possibly older than the Himalayas. The name "Mount積石" was found in the "Tribute of Yu," which would have been before the Han Dynasty. From the plane, the Mount積石 I saw had few steep cliffs and mostly resembled an upside-down bowl, with no strange peaks rising around it. According to geographical knowledge, mountains that have been around for a long time are gradually smoothed and lowered by wind and rain erosion, so there is probably no doubt that Mount積石 has a long history.</p>
<p>Looking down from the high altitude, the top of Mount積石 is covered with ice and snow. I simply cannot believe that there could be any plants or trees growing on the mountain, but according to experts, there may be life below the snow line. It's just that it cannot be seen with the naked eye from the plane. It is speculated that those plants and animals must be similar to those in the Arctic Circle, such as polar bears and antelopes. As for whether the mountains contain valuable minerals, that is naturally not something that can be conjectured out of thin air. Tibetans widely believe that 阿尼瑪卿 is the birthplace of Tsongkhapa, and the gold of the tiles of Kumbum Monastery was mined from 阿尼瑪卿.</p>
<p>Mount積石 is located at the first bend of the Yellow River. Its direction is from northwest, winding down to southeast. The further east it goes, the lower the mountain becomes. The Yellow River bends north between Gongma Sangla, and the mountain disappears. To find high peaks, you must start in the northwest. According to the observation of the geographer Huang Jiqing, Mount積石 seems unlikely to have high peaks because: (1) Mount積石 is surrounded by the Yellow River on three sides and a plateau on one side. The height of the Yellow River is only 3,000 meters. It is abnormal for a mountain more than 5,000 meters higher than the river to appear in this narrow area. (2) High mountain areas, such as the Himalayas and Karakoram, are often layers upon layers of mountains. However, Mount積石 is isolated, descending directly to the Yellow River on both sides. (3) In terms of geological structure, the highest peaks of the world's major continents are the product of the Alpine orogeny and are new fold mountains. Mount積石 is an ancient Paleozoic fold mountain, an old mountain, not a new mountain, and its height should be inferior to new fold mountains. However, there is another argument that Mount積石 is a fault-block mountain. The Yellow River flows along its north-south fault lines, or the intrusion of a large intrusive rock mass can create a height that exceeds it.</p>
<p>Regardless of which of the above two theories is correct, according to the actual measurements of the Central Air Transport Corporation's exploration plane, it is confirmed that there are indeed no peaks on Mount積石 exceeding 20,000 feet. Now that the mystery has been solved, what remains is how to open the door to this natural treasure house and write a new page for world history, geology, biology, and ethnology.</p>
<p>Sa Bendong and others from the Academia Sinica are busy collecting data and burying themselves in hard work. This epoch-making exploration is expected to begin in the clear and refreshing autumn season. At that time, high-altitude detection and ground surveys will be carried out simultaneously. This reporter had the opportunity to fly over Mount積石 on a special plane. I have recorded in detail the flight route, the height, temperature, air pressure, and flight altitude of each mountain that was passed. Now, I have specially organized them. If they can be used as a reference for the second exploration, then my hard work will not have been in vain.</p>

<p>[Reuters Jerusalem, 28th] Jewish forces continue to attack in Palestine, and thousands of refugees are flocking to Transjordan, Syria, and Lebanon to escape. Official reports have confirmed that the claim that Transjordanian troops have invaded Palestine is inaccurate.</p>

He said: Foreign newspapers have a natural tendency to overemphasize formal contradictions, which basically do not exist. He suggested that the United States must not allow any doubts about its ability to carry out various policies. The United States should have a consistent expression in dealing with foreign countries and should not express different party policies.</p>

<h3>Mobil Oil Tanker Radioed from Shanghai: Corpse and Smuggled Goods Found Onboard, Customs Sends Patrol Boat to Intercept and Search</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Report] The Mobil Oil Company's oil tanker "Charles Meyer," en route from Persia to Shanghai, discovered a large quantity of contraband and the corpses of two Chinese sailors in a secret compartment on board. The captain has urgently telegraphed the Shanghai Mobil Oil Company. The ship is expected to arrive in Shanghai today. The company has reported the matter to Customs to make necessary arrangements. Upon the ship's arrival, it will be subjected to a thorough search.</p>
<p>The "Charles Meyer" comes from the Persian Gulf, carrying 5,000 tons of oil to Hong Kong and 9,000 tons to Shanghai. The nature and quantity of the contraband currently discovered is unknown, as the captain's telegram was vague. However, it is known that the two bodies were discovered in a box-shaped small compartment installed on the side of the ship for ease of repair. This box-shaped gate is airtight and not ventilated, making it an ideal place to hide smuggled goods. However, due to lack of air circulation, carbon monoxide produced therein may cause smugglers to die from poisoning. Previously, customs officers in this city had fainted while inspecting a ship's box-shaped gate due to foul air inside. Thus, the bodies found on board may be smugglers who suffocated. Customs authorities have now dispatched patrol boats to wait outside the Wusongkou to intercept the ship and board it for a search, to prevent any remaining smugglers from escaping after the ship docks.</p>
<h3>Special Criminal Court Trials Thirty Communist Bandits Who Damaged Power Plant, After Interrogation, Returned to Police Department in Original Vehicle</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Report] The Garrison Headquarters yesterday transferred eleven suspects in the case of the "Six Party" underground paper weaving group, a North Communist group, attempting to sabotage the power company's generators, to the Special Criminal Court for trial. The names of those transferred yesterday were Wang Xiaohe, Wu Guozhen, Wu Shishen, Tan Asi, Song Changgeng, Tang Lansheng, Feng Renzhong, Huang Hongxun, Shi Jingen, Dai Shougen, and Gu Rongsheng, etc., a total of eleven people. Their crime was to put iron filings into the generators of the Yangshupu Power Plant, attempting to cause an explosion, create terror, and put hundreds of thousands of workers out of work, thereby creating chaos. Fortunately, it was discovered early, and no major disaster occurred. After investigation and handling by the Garrison Headquarters, it was discovered that Wang et al. were responsible, and they were arrested. The situation was very tense when the case was transferred to the Special Criminal Court at 3:30 pm yesterday. Wang et al. were all tightly bound with handcuffs and ropes, sitting in a red garrison vehicle, protected by two other red motorcycle carts in front and behind, with soldiers carrying guns and ammunition. Later, because the Special Criminal Court's detention center was already "full," Wang et al. were briefly interrogated and then returned to the Police Department in the original vehicle.</p>
<p>In addition, two other suspects in the case, Zhang Shibao and Chen Longgen, were transferred to the Special Criminal Court by the Garrison Department last night, briefly interrogated, and then returned to the Garrison Department.</p>
<h3>Jiaoren Wheel Leaves for Tianjin, Fugitive Hidden on Board, Military Authorities Dispatch Boat in Pursuit</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Report] When the China Merchants Bureau's "Jiaoren" wheel left Shanghai from the No. 12 and 13 pontoons in Nanshi at 1:00 pm yesterday to sail to Tianjin, a certain military agency in this city suddenly received information that an important Communist Party member was hidden on board, intending to go to Tianjin for activities. After requesting instructions from superiors, they immediately dispatched officers to go. At that time, the wheel had already sailed for about half an hour, so they coordinated with the China Merchants Bureau's police department and dispatched a speedboat to pursue it. At 2:30 pm, it was intercepted on the Yangshupu River. The wheel was ordered to stop, and a comprehensive search was carried out on board, which lasted until around 4:00 pm. The results were not disclosed by personnel from a certain military agency. However, it is known that the fugitive's surname is Lin, and he was newly sent from Hong Kong to North China to engage in activities. Because the Lin fugitive still had a certain confidential task to carry out in Shanghai, he secretly came to Shanghai in advance and then waited for the wheel to go north.</p>
<h3>National Bank Does Not Provide Loans for Foreign Exchange Settlement of Public Utilities</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Report] In order to seek indirect subsidies for the implementation of public utilities in this city, the municipal government consulted with the Central Bank to provide low-interest loans, so that various public utility companies could settle foreign exchange in advance and purchase coal for the next month's allocation. It is now known that the National Bank did not provide loans because the loan violated the regulations. In addition, the municipal government has submitted a request to the Ministry of Finance to maintain the April tax rate in order to reduce the cost of public utilities. As for whether the new prices for the eight major public utilities in this city in May should still apply the automatic adjustment method for public utility prices, the central government has not given any instructions. The municipal government has decided to reduce the cost of public utilities as a principle, reducing the amount of price increase.</p>
<h3>Municipal Government Asks China Merchants Bureau to Send Ships to Qinhuangdao to Load Coal</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Report] Regarding the supply of coal in this city, the municipal government has reached an agreement with the Fuel Management Committee, that the municipal government will dispatch ships to Qinhuangdao to load and transport it to Shanghai. In terms of price, if the coal is loaded and arrives before the end of this month, it will be settled at the April price; otherwise, it must be calculated after the new price for May is determined. Now the municipal government has asked the China Merchants Bureau to send two ships to rush to the area to load the coal. It is expected that at least a portion of it can be transported within this month. However, the total transport capacity of the two ships from the China Merchants Bureau is only 20,000 tons, while the city's coal consumption is 40,000 tons per month. The city can try to raise 10,000 tons, but it is still short of 10,000 tons of coal, and the source of that is uncertain.</p>
<h3>Poor Sales of Registered Household Rice Due to Inferior Quality of US Rice</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Report] According to the Public Opinion Survey Association, the amount of relief rice sold in this city in April was about 50% less than in March. There are two reasons for this: (1) Two-thirds of the relief rice supplied to the market in April was American rice, and only 70,000 to 80,000 bags were domestic rice. The American rice was of inferior quality and did not suit the taste of the citizens, so sales of registered household rice were sluggish. (2) The market price and the ration price were not very different. The authorities have not dumped much rice, but have been able to stabilize market prices. They have now decided to continue to do so for three months. From next month, American rice will still be the main component of the rationed rice, supplemented by domestic rice, and there will be no problem with the source.</p>

The general assembly of representatives from the six provinces is expected to be held in Shanghai at the end of next month. According to Wang, the chief of the Materials Section of the Fisheries Administration, the materials received by the agency are of many types, so sorting requires a considerable amount of time. The agency has now organized a joint inspection team with foreign representatives from the Custody Committee to inspect various materials and classify them.</p>
<h3>Fisheries Symposium Decides to Postpone Convening</h3>
<p>[Another News] The Executive Yuan's Relief and Rehabilitation Administration originally planned to convene a symposium in Beijing yesterday, bringing together representatives from the Custody Committee, the Fisheries Administration, private fisheries industry representatives, and fisheries representatives from the National Assembly, to discuss issues related to the fishing industry and reports from the competent authorities on the handling of materials and business.

<h3>The Case of Zeng Dechong's Suicide in Beiping Due to Love Lost, The Female Protagonist in Shanghai Prepares to Marry, Talking Freely About the Twists and Turns of Their Acquaintance</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Report] The circumstances surrounding the suicide of Zeng Dechong, the director of the Beiping Police Bureau's confidential office, due to love lost, are quite complex. The female protagonist in the case, Fang Yixian, is currently residing at No. 8, Ai New Village, Yuqing Road, Shanghai. When reporters visited yesterday, her fiancé, lawyer Luo Cunbin, was also present. According to Fang, she met the deceased Zeng Dechong as early as 1939, during the early days of the Anti-Japanese War. Fang was only seventeen years old at the time, and motivated by the national crisis, she joined the Political Department of the 176th Division of the Fifth War Zone to engage in propaganda work for the Anti-Japanese War. The deceased was the director of the Political Department at the time, and her direct superior. Fang, with her beautiful appearance, had no shortage of colleagues pursuing her, and Director Zeng Dechong was one of the most ardent pursuers. Fang, in this situation, found it difficult to cope with.</p>
<p>Schemed and Lost Her Virginity, Desperate and Furious</p>
<p>Later, Zeng used his power to falsely accuse Fang of impure thoughts and imprisoned her. In the spring of 1940, when the war was raging in the Dabie Mountains, Zeng Dechong designed to have Fang released from prison at a friend's house in Wangjiachong, and after anesthetizing her with narcotics, he raped her. The next morning, Fang discovered that she had lost her virginity, and was desperate and furious. Taking advantage of Zeng's unpreparedness, she obtained his self-defense pistol and fired two shots at him, one of which hit Zeng's arm, causing only minor injuries. She was then disarmed, and no tragedy occurred. Afterwards, Zeng still expressed his love, but Fang hated him deeply and never lessened her hatred.</p>
<p>Soon, this matter spread throughout the army, and there was a lot of talk. Zeng's behavior was soon learned by his superiors, and he was dismissed from his post. Fang, unexpectedly, became pregnant after this terrifying night. In the winter of 1940, she gave birth to a boy, but he died after only four months.</p>
<p>Enemies Meet on a Narrow Road, Heart Cold</p>
<p>As the war situation changed, Fang followed the army to Guilin and worked for the Engineering Committee. Unexpectedly, enemies meet on a narrow road, and she met Zeng again. At this time, Zeng was a consultant to the Guilin Pacification Commissioner's Office and a counselor to the provincial government, but he had not forgotten Fang and often pestered her, but Fang remained cold and distant. At the same time, Fang began to know Luo Cunbin. After talking, Luo expressed great sympathy for her. Over time, pity turned into love, and they finally announced their official engagement. Soon, victory came, and Zeng Dechong, through introductions, went to Ping to serve as the director of the Police Bureau's confidential office, while Luo Cunbin soon came to Shanghai. Fang then followed him south, and the two once returned to Fang's hometown of Anqing. During this time, Fang often corresponded with the deceased's family. The deceased was from Guilin, Guangxi, and his brothers Zeng Zhiyi and Zeng Yuchun both hold positions in the military, political, educational, and cultural circles of Beiping, and are all people of status. Because Zeng Dechong had repeatedly told his family about Fang's past, they were very concerned about her. Although his brothers and sisters repeatedly advised him, Zeng Dechong remained obstinate.</p>
<p>Remained Obstinate and Staged a Tragedy</p>
<p>Later, Fang, in preparation for her marriage to Luo, once went to Beiping at the request of the deceased's family to sign a document with Zeng Dechong, stating that they would break off all relations from then on, so as to avoid any further troubles. However, the deceased stubbornly refused. Fang could not wait any longer and left Ping to go south on the 2nd of the month. When the news that she was preparing to formally marry Luo recently spread, Zeng Dechong knew that the matter was hopeless, and out of resentment, he ultimately staged this tragic suicide.</p>

Because it was too late to avoid it, it collided with the military truck. The matter has been reasonably resolved after mutual rescue and repair, it was said.</p>
<h3>Cotton Weavers Summoned for Questioning on Suspicion of Counterfeiting Trademarks</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Report] From 10:00 am to 12:00 pm on the 19th, the Jin'gang Drama Troupe broadcast a special program at the Qingdao Road Tiansheng Radio Station to promote the sale of cheap 414 Lao Pai Towels. As a result, the Cuizhong Manufacturing Company discovered that what was being sold was the 414 Zhong Zi Pai Towel, which was a counterfeit of the company's registered trademark 414 Zhong Zi Pai Towel. They reported this to the Xincheng Police Sub-Bureau, which dispatched personnel to investigate. After transferring the case, the person in charge of the Tianhua Cotton Weaving Factory, Gu Lingen, was summoned for questioning on suspicion of counterfeiting trademarks. A document has been prepared to be submitted to the District Prosecutor's Office for review because he is suspected of the crime of counterfeiting trademarks.</p>
<h3>Reorganization of Industrial Trade Associations Decided to Proceed According to Original Steps, Standards for Membership Eligibility Have Been Relaxed</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Report] Regarding the reorganization of various industrial trade associations in this city, Wang Jiashu, director of the Second Bureau of the Social Affairs Bureau, told reporters: Since the Industrial Association Law was promulgated, the Social Affairs Bureau, under the orders of the Ministry of Social Affairs, has been guiding important industrial trade associations and municipal industrial trade associations to reorganize in accordance with the new law. Meetings were convened separately to instruct on the matters to be carried out. At that time, the most difficult problem for each association was that the membership qualifications had to be in accordance with the draft Factory Law, requiring that they have machines and normally employ more than 30 workers, or not have machines and normally employ more than 60 workers. If this standard were strictly enforced, all small factories that did not meet the above conditions would have to withdraw from the existing associations, which would cause widespread difficulties for each association. The Social Affairs Bureau has reported the actual situation of industry in this city to the Ministry of Social Affairs, requesting that the standards be relaxed and that factories that do not meet the standards but have already joined the associations be allowed to register as members. This point has been approved by the Ministry of Social Affairs and the Ministry of Economics, so the reorganization work can proceed smoothly. Currently, about one-third of the associations have scheduled reorganization meetings, and it is expected that all will be reorganized by mid-May at the latest. Rumors that the reorganization of industrial associations will be postponed before the Commercial Association Law is amended, and that some industrial associations in this city have requested that the reorganization deadline be extended to October, the Social Affairs Bureau has not received any new instructions from the Ministry of Social Affairs. The reorganization work of each industrial association will still proceed according to the original steps. All reorganization procedures and precautions should be based on the regulations of the Ministry of Social Affairs and the Social Affairs Bureau, and the methods set by any other organization have no decisive effect.</p>
<h3>Yongxitang Funeral Home, Refugees Once Occupied, Social Affairs Bureau Investigated and Moved Out That Night</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Report] The Yongxitang Funeral Home at No. 694, Liyuan Road, Nanshi, had new recruits stationed there by the Division Management District, and they moved out on the 26th. Unexpectedly, at around 9:00 am yesterday, a group of male and female refugees, about a thousand people, some wearing uniforms and robes and some wearing short outfits, broke the lock and forced their way in. The home saw that there were many people and could not stop them, so they reported to the Liyuan Road Police Station and urgently telegraphed the Songshan Police Sub-Bureau to report to the Municipal Police Bureau, which immediately ordered the Security Police Corps Brigade of Security Police and flying fortresses to rush to suppress them. However, there were already more than 500 refugees stationed in various rooms, and the security police were stationed in the hall. After receiving the report, the Social Affairs Bureau urgently sent personnel to investigate the number of refugees and strive to provide relief and resettlement. It is understood that the refugees had automatically moved out by around 9:00 pm.</p>
<h3>Trial Opens in Lunacy Mystery Case: Is Yan Peixing Mentally Ill? Two Doctors Offer Conflicting Diagnoses; Further Expert Determination Pending Before Resumption of Hearing</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Dispatch] In the "Lunacy Mystery" case, concerning Yuan Baoying's accusation that Yan Peixing is mentally ill and requesting a judgment of interdiction, presiding Judge He Xianzhang of the Seventh Civil Court conducted an inquiry yesterday morning. Dr. Han Fen, the head of the Neuropsychiatry Department at the Public Concession Hospital, and Dr. Huang Yingbang, the head of the Puji Hospital, testified. First, Australian Dr. Han Fen testified: "I diagnosed Yan on April 5th, 6th, and 7th, and listened to the statements of his relatives and friends. From beginning to end, I did not find any signs of mental illness. On April 18th, I jointly diagnosed him with Professor Weissbrodt, a psychology professor at Shanghai University. According to the professor's conclusion, no signs of any pathological symptoms in Yan's brain tissue could be found. However, based on Yan's past behavior, it can be determined that he is a person with an inferiority complex. Because of this 'inferiority complex,' he often seeks to gain power and be respected by others. This is a form of escape from an unpleasant reality. People with inferiority complexes often exaggerate their actions, and some of his absurd notes can be explained by this."</p>
<p>Subsequently, Dr. Huang Yingbang testified. Due to illness, he was permitted by the court to answer questions while seated: "Yan Peixing was brought to the hospital for treatment by Yuan Baoying around 5:00 PM on February 9th of this year. The patient's condition upon entering the hospital can be divided into three phases:</p>
<p>Phase 1: Excitement, restlessness, insomnia, and grandiose thoughts; Phase 2: Gradually becoming quiet, sometimes excited, sometimes dull, taciturn, and improved sleep; Phase 3: Quiet, without grandiose language. The conclusions based on the examination are: (1) Not cerebral syphilis; (2) Possibly periodic paranoid psychosis, but this condition is difficult to determine in a short period; (3) The symptoms during hospitalization were initially excitement and grandiosity, followed by slight depression; (4) All of the above phenomena may be an occasional mental disorder reaction in people who are extremely sensitive to emotions, mentally unbalanced, and unable to control themselves when subjected to temporary stimulation."</p>
<p>Defendant Yan Peixing, in addition to submitting a written defense in court stating that he had no mental illness, also presented a copy of the factory's meeting minutes from April 22nd to prove that he was capable of handling affairs. He also pointed out in court that Dr. Huang had demanded 1 billion yuan from him, saying that he would be released from the hospital if he had the money. However, the court did not investigate this matter. Subsequently, Yan's lawyer stood up and argued: "According to Article 14 of the Civil Code, it refers to a continuous mental illness state, which is not consistent with the defendant's situation. Moreover, the evidence presented by the plaintiff is all old evidence. We request the court to reject the plaintiff's claim."</p>
<p>Finally, Judge He declared: "If the evidence in this case is complete, a ruling will be made directly. However, there are still questions that need to be resolved by a well-known domestic psychiatrist. Dr. Han Fen is a foreign doctor, and there may be inaccuracies due to repeated translations. Therefore, we must wait for a re-diagnosis before scheduling another hearing."</p>

<h3>Distant Recipient of Charity Housing: Resident of Guiyang Writes to Register</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Dispatch] Yesterday, a recipient of Type A charity housing in our city, currently residing far away in Guiyang, wrote to the Winter Relief Association to register. The person's name is Yu Yiyan, and the number is Han Zi 04699. It is stated that because he is far away in Guiyang, he cannot rush to Shanghai to register. He is currently preparing to resign from his current position in June, raise travel expenses, and bring his family to Shanghai to complete the housing acquisition procedures. After completing the procedures, he plans to move to Shanghai and seek another job. However, according to the person in charge of the Winter Relief Association, registration by letter from lottery winners cannot be considered official registration because it is based on mere words without proof. It can only be tentatively filed for record. It is still hoped that the winner will bring the lottery ticket to register in person.</p>
<h3>Ballad Singer Zhou Xiaochun Arrested for Seduction</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Dispatch] Zhou Xiaochun, a famous ballad singer, 46 years old, from Suzhou, residing at No. 1, Lane 23, Chongqing Middle Road, in October of the 35th year of the Republic, had his niece, Pan Quanying (currently 16 years old, from Suzhou), introduced by a colleague, Pan Boying, to study with Zhou as her teacher. In July of last year, the teacher took her to Wuzhen, Zhejiang, to perform ballads, and they slept in the same room at night, resulting in a relationship. She became secretly pregnant. A few days ago, the teacher and student returned to Shanghai together. Quanying's mother (residing upstairs at Huiquan Lou Bookstore on Fujian Road), seeing the situation, questioned her strictly. The daughter finally revealed everything. Last night around 10 PM, she reported to the Lao Zha Police Station, which transferred the case to the Songshan Branch. Officers were dispatched to Zhou's residence on Chongqing Road and arrested him, taking him to the station and accusing him of seducing a girl under the age of 16. He is scheduled to be transferred to the District Prosecutor's Office today for investigation.</p>
<h3>Dade, After Visiting Our Textile Mill, Believes Management Efficiency is Very High</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Dispatch] Dade, the leader of the Allied Textile Group, arrived in Shanghai on the 24th and has been visiting major textile mills in the city for several days, and has also been consulting with the Yarn Control Committee. Dade told reporters yesterday: "From observing the products of Chinese textile factories, it is clear that the management efficiency is very high and the management is excellent. The supply of cotton from US aid, amounting to 150 million US dollars, is a great help to the Chinese textile industry. Because of the implementation of the Marshall Plan, Europe will obtain American cotton worth over 500 million US dollars. Therefore, it will be difficult to purchase on the American market due to this huge need. I hope that after China obtains this supply, it can be distributed in the fairest and most reasonable way according to the production situation of each factory. The Allied Forces hope that the Japanese textile industry can start operating at 4 million spindles. However, in the next few years, Chinese textile products will be used to meet their own needs, so there will be no sharp competition with Japan."</p>
<h3>Abdominal Pain and Vomiting After Eating Vegetarian Food; Testing of Raw Oil Shows No Toxic Substances</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Dispatch] Chen Zizhan, the manager of Jinxiang Yarn Company in this city, and his relatives and friends all experienced abdominal pain and vomiting after eating vegetarian food at Lingyan Temple on Lingyan Mountain in Suzhou on the 25th. They recovered after one or two days. Mr. Chen has now returned to Shanghai. He said that on the day they ate vegetarian food at Lingyan Temple, the monks, fearing that people from Shanghai were not used to eating soybean oil and rapeseed oil, specially went to a nearby oil shop to buy raw oil for cooking. Unexpectedly, after eating, everyone experienced abdominal pain and vomiting one after another. Fortunately, everyone was unharmed and gradually recovered. A small amount of the remaining raw oil has now been brought to Shanghai and sent to a doctor at the Third Municipal Hospital for testing. It was found that there were no toxic substances in it, but it had impurities with the smell of tung oil. Therefore, the reason is that the raw oil contained tung oil. It is also heard that Mr. Chen invited relatives and friends to Lingyan Mountain this time to hold a cremation ceremony for his deceased mother. After this incident, local superstitious people have spread various rumors.</p>
<p>According to a letter from Lingyan Temple to this newspaper: Chen Zizhan held a banquet in the mountains. The cook used was hired by Mr. Chen from Shanghai. At that time, because the temple's soybean oil and rapeseed oil were not to his taste, he temporarily purchased 20 jin of white raw oil from a Wanjianqiao oil shop in Suzhou. It was past noon when it arrived at the mountain, so the cook began cooking in a hurry. After the meal, some of the guests did vomit, but all 200 of the temple's monks were safe and sound.</p>

<h3>This Year's Required Tea Loan Funds: China Farmers Bank Has Separately Allocated; Tea Merchants' Request for Increase May Be Difficult to Fulfill</h3>
<p>This year's tea loan will be issued by the China Farmers Bank. Zhou Mengxin, the director of the bank's business department, came to Shanghai a few days ago to discuss the allocation of funds with the Central Bank. The Farmers Bank has allocated the loan amounts for processing, transportation, and collateral in each production area within the total of 849 billion yuan approved by the Joint Treasury. Yesterday, it was approved by President Liu of the Central Bank, and it can be allocated separately today. According to Zhou, the government's tea loan program over the years has been aimed at encouraging exports and earning foreign exchange by providing low-interest funds. The 849 billion yuan approved by the Joint Treasury this year represents the government's greatest effort. This loan is issued in three phases. The first phase is for processing loans, the second phase is for boxed tea transportation loans, and the third phase is for export boxed tea collateral loans. During the boxed tea transportation loan phase, the processing loan is deducted. During the export boxed tea collateral loan phase, the transportation loan is deducted. Tea merchants can use this loan in a cyclical manner, which is of great help to them. It is also learned that tea merchants believe that the tea loan figures approved by the Joint Treasury are too small and the loan period is too short. They hope that the government will increase it and will formally make a request. However, according to relevant sources, the government does not intend to consider this.</p>
<h3>Chinese Stocks Continue to Weaken; Market Transactions are Sluggish</h3>
<p>Chinese stocks weakened further yesterday due to the continuing Vice Presidential election and flat materials market. Interest among industry insiders also waned, and stocks continued to decline with sluggish transactions. Only Yong Yarn had a final struggle near closing.</p>
<p>The morning began with uncertainty. Yong Yarn opened lower at 2,025 yuan, rose to 2,035 yuan after opening. With no changes in foreign exchange rates, No. 102 and others sold off, falling below the 2,000 yuan mark. However, credit was very loose, and agency fees also opened lower at 16 yuan and 19 yuan. There was a slight rebound, rising to 2,025 yuan, but with no new buyers, the floating long positions collapsed first after 11:30, falling to 1,979 yuan. At noon, the market was forced down to 1,983 yuan. With the Vice Presidential election resuming and various materials rebounding, sentiment in the stock market became even more unsustainable. Compared to the previous close, Zhongfa, Zhabei, Xinhua, Jinglun, Xinyi, and Huaxin all fell by half a percent, and the remaining stocks all fell slightly.</p>
<p>In the afternoon, the market opened at 1,995 yuan. With the National Bank entering the market, it rebounded to 2,030 yuan. Near closing, Nos. 197 and 145 raised the price to 2,035 yuan, closing at 2,030 yuan. Compared to the morning close, Lian'an National Goods remained flat, while the remaining stocks all rose slightly. Various unlisted stocks outside the market were mediocre and slightly declined.</p>
<p>Foreign stocks saw both gains and losses yesterday. Inventory was limited, making it easier to rise than fall. Yisha opened at 3.19 million, falling from 3.23 million to 3.16 million. Near closing, it easily rebounded to 3.23 million to end the day. Trading volume was not high, and supply was limited. As a result, compared to the previous close, British Union, Jardine Matheson, Wheelock, Steel, and Paperboard all fell slightly, while Yisha, Yeguang, and Aviation rose slightly. Yipi and Shipping remained flat.</p>
<p>Government bonds continued to flourish yesterday, with a trading volume of approximately 5 million. Tong Bing opened at 120,000 yuan, rising from 122,000 to 239,000 to end the day. Compared to the previous close, Types Jia, Yi, Ding each rose by 12,000, Type Bing rose by 16,000, and Type Wu rose by 15,000.</p>
<p>Revision of Internal Exchange Rates: The internal exchange rates of the Four Banks, Two Bureaus, and One Treasury will be revised from the 29th as follows: Fuzhou 50 yuan, Quanzhou 60 yuan, Guangzhou 50 yuan, Shantou and Haikou 60 yuan each, Liuzhou, Wuzhou, and Nanning 40 yuan each, Changsha and Hengyang 20 yuan each, Tunxi and Shexian 80 yuan each, Wuhan 15 yuan, Shashi and Yichang 80 yuan each, Nanchang 20 yuan, Jingdezhen 40 yuan, Jiujiang 30 yuan, Ji'an and Ganzhou 40 yuan each, Guizhou 40 yuan.</p>
<h3>Trade Association Announces Registered Amounts for Imported Materials with Self-Provided Foreign Exchange</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Dispatch] According to Hua Hongtao, a representative of the Import and Export Association, there are slight discrepancies in the reported registered amounts for imported materials with self-provided foreign exchange. He stated that the total number registered with the Import Control Committee previously was 46 million US dollars, of which 35 million US dollars were shipped to Shanghai after removing those that were unloaded halfway. To date, approximately 1,670 applications, totaling 28 million US dollars, have been submitted to the China Trust Bureau for purchase. Among them, approximately 1,480 applications, totaling 21 million US dollars, have been allocated by the China Trust Bureau, meaning the foreign exchange has been settled.</p>
<p>Also, at the Import and Export Trade Association meeting held the afternoon before yesterday, the following matters were reported: The method of dividing foreign currency deposit slips will be based on the previously decided method, dividing into two phases, with one slip expiring each month. It is heard that the government is rushing to process these foreign currency deposit slips and they will be issued soon. The 1/10th legal profit given by the government for purchasing goods with self-provided foreign exchange can be issued at the same time as the foreign currency deposit slips. Regarding the issue of using foreign currency deposit slips for deductions, the import and export industry hopes to be able to deduct them simultaneously in the import quotas for the fourth and fifth quarters.</p>
<h3>Bank of Communications Shareholders' Meeting: Commercial Shareholder Directors Have Been Elected</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Dispatch] The Bank of Communications held its 30th Annual General Meeting of Shareholders at 3:00 PM yesterday (the 28th) on the fourth floor of the Bank of China at No. 23 The Bund. The number of shares present was 554,362, meeting the legal quorum, and the meeting was immediately convened. Chairman Qian Yongming gave the opening remarks, General Manager Zhao Dihua reported on the business conditions for the 36th year of the Republic, and then Permanent Supervisor Lu Xian reported on the final account settlement proposal, profit distribution proposal, and the final account settlement proposal for the Savings Department and Trust Department for the 36th year of the Republic. All accounts have been audited by the supervisors without error. Furthermore, the terms of office of the bank's directors have expired.

The meeting adjourned at 5:00 PM.</p>
<h3>Cotton Yarn and Cloth Transactions are Sluggish</h3>
<p>The cotton yarn market yesterday was sluggish because it was the period for the textile construction allocation, with a large number of quotas. Merchants in this street were slow to accept, and out-of-town purchases were also light, leading to a softening market atmosphere. The opening and closing prices of 42-count Blue Phoenix fine yarn were both 233 million yuan, down 2 million from the previous day. Shuiyue and Jincheng also fell by 2-3 million yuan. Although 21-count Double Horse yarn was supported by floating long positions, it ultimately ended 4 million lower at 156 million due to oversupply. The remaining counts of coarse and fine yarns also fell by 1-2 million to 3-4 million yuan.</p>
<p>The cotton cloth market yesterday was characterized by a large supply of the textile construction supply the day before, with ample chips in the market. The number of suppliers was more than the demand, and customer support was declining. Local retail sales were also weak. 12-pound Longtou fine cloth went from 5,034,000 yuan all the way down to 4,980,000 yuan at closing, a small drop of 70,000 yuan from the previous day. Wufu Caiqiu, Blue Chicken, and other fine cloths also fell by 40,000-50,000 to 80,000 yuan. Other cloths were weak, but Shirting remained stable.</p>
<p>Also, the initial purchase price for Blue Chicken fine cloth supplied by the textile construction company was broken even, and in the middle of the process it was sold at a loss of 10,000-20,000, and finally at a loss of 30,000 yuan, opening at 4,530,000 yuan. Laba Tong fine cloth was sold at 4,640,000, 3A Caiqiu at 4,470,000, and Si Junzi, Yuan Biji, and Poplin were all sold at a loss of 50,000-60,000 yuan. Poplin was priced at 5,600,000 yuan.</p>
<p>The spot cotton market was flat yesterday, with sparse transactions. However, the prices in the producing areas have been rising sharply recently. Cotton merchants do not have much inventory on hand, and once they sell it, they will suffer a loss when hedging, so the supply is scarce, and transactions are only with a few customer peddlers, squeezing on credit. Jingyang was sold for 25 million, Zhengzhou for 25.3 million, Hankou mixed fine for 20 million, Huo Ji for 19.5 million, 20 million, and Zhoupu seed cotton for 5.06 million to 5.08 million.</p>
<h3>Effectiveness of This Year's Agricultural Loans</h3>
<p>Cotton and Grain Production Can Reach Target</p>
<p>Li Shuming, General Manager of the China Farmers Bank, stated: The total amount of agricultural loans this year is 15 trillion, of which 2 trillion is used for sugarcane loans by the Cooperative Bank of Taiwan. The majority of the remaining funds are used for grain, cotton, and farmland water conservancy. It is estimated that a total of 7.5 million shi of rice and 1.5 million shi of wheat and miscellaneous grains can be increased. The average increase in yield per mu is estimated at 5 shi for rice and 3 shi for wheat and miscellaneous grains. The loan amount is 5 trillion in total. The area is 20 million mu, including 15 million mu of rice and 5 million mu of wheat and miscellaneous grains.

However, student groups of the university should apply to the Department of Student Affairs for meetings held on campus in accordance with the regulations. The three music groups, such as the Muse Society, held meetings automatically in Hanyuan, which was not in accordance with the regulations. The address of Hanyuan is next to Guoquan Road, which is not within the scope of the university, and the nearby shops, residents, and air force barracks are not owned by the university and cannot be regarded as within the campus. This time, the Muse Society and other groups held meetings outside the campus without authorization, which attracted the attention of outsiders. They should be more vigilant in the future. (2) As for student dormitories, they should not be illegally invaded by others. It is heard that after the search in Hanyuan on that day, unidentified persons broke into Yang Sheng Guichang's dormitory to search. If this is true, the university will definitely raise a more serious protest. However, up to now, it is only based on hearsay, and no one has come forward to prove it. If solid evidence can be provided, it will be easier for the university to conduct negotiations and obtain results. (3) The organization of the so-called Departmental Joint Association is not legally based, and the so-called "Human Rights Protection Association" is also not within the scope of campus activities. The procedures for its establishment are even more problematic. These two groups should be banned immediately. In the future, anyone who uses the name of these two groups to conduct any activities on campus will be punished. (4) The university cannot change the student union charter issued by the Ministry of Education. Since the Ministry's order does not allow for any changes, if * the Ministry's military establishes a student union, the university can allow it to proceed with the organization at any time.</p>

<h3>"Science and Politics"</h3>
<p>— Yang Shi</p>
<p>("Science and Politics," By Prof. A.D. Ritchie, Oxford University Press, London, 1947)</p>
<p>The rapid progress of science and the crisis in politics, the result of their incompatibility, is the very difficult and urgent problem that the world faces today. Hatred and alienation are increasing day by day; the crisis and chaos are deepening, making us feel that mankind has thrown itself into an abyss of problems that are almost impossible to solve. More dangerous than in 1914, people are again beginning to have the terrible idea of "eliminating war with war." Two or three years after the end of a decade of massacres, we really cannot stand these nervous stimulations anymore. But this is the problem; wise people cannot close their eyes and let those political contenders blunder blindly. Once a disaster occurs, no one can stop it. On the contrary, they must face it squarely and try to use their wisdom to find the safest path for mankind.</p>
<p>Professor A.D. Ritchie of Durham University in England discusses these urgent problems extensively in his recent book "Science and Politics." The original text is compiled from the lectures given at the university's "Riddle Memorial Lectures," so it still appears clear and accessible. His topic is not limited to the "control of the atomic bomb," but broadly discusses what important role science (including scientists) plays in this world, and what significant impacts they have in a country; and proposes the new significance of science in politics.</p>
<p>The cultural development of mankind to this day has made science and politics closely intertwined. It is almost impossible to talk about science alone; therefore, Professor Ritchie discusses them together. Consider that a country can use the great power of science to increase human happiness, or it can destroy humanity entirely. Therefore, some wise people standing outside the situation (including those outside scientists who only pursue truth and do not consider the consequences, burying themselves in the laboratory all day long) feel confused and indignant. A calm scientist, out of a sense of moral responsibility, must be alarmed and must imagine how many terrible messes these politicians who have not received a good scientific education will make after holding the power to use science.</p>
<p>The author himself admits that he is dreaming a beautiful dream. He hopes that political power and the ability to choose science are in the same hand, meaning that the highest ruling power of the country should be given to scientists. He said, "Scientists have the power to destroy the world, and they will have the power to save the world."</p>
<p>However, science and politics are an uncompromising pair of enemies. A first-class scientist cannot maintain his noble position in science if he wants to live a completely political life, due to the rapid progress of science, and even more because politics is a job that requires the entire time. It is almost impossible for a scientist to engage in successful political activities at the same time. Professor Ritchie said, "Our so-called political activities are by no means just attending a few parliamentary debates, occupying a few ministerial positions, or being a member of a royal advisory committee." Due to the expansion of national power in modern times, an active politician must devote all his energy to dealing with all the problems he encounters; therefore, he cannot engage in another kind of affair. There are many such examples in the United Kingdom. Often, the representatives elected by university constituencies are mostly uninvolved and only hold a nominal title. Readers may think that this is only a phenomenon in Western democratic countries (referring to England and France), but the author said, "Whether it is an Eastern democratic country (referring to the Soviet Union) or a Western democratic country, it is the same. The question is whether scientists are willing to abandon their superior position in science and pursue political power that they are not interested in."</p>
<p>The author seems to be talking about a dream that is not easy to realize, so he proposes another way to effectively express the political views of scientists, which is to increase their seats in parliament, recommend outstanding scientists as senators, and give special attention to the expression of political views by institutions such as the Royal Society. But even so, there are still difficulties. One of the difficulties is whether political leaders will cooperate with them obediently. Therefore, he turned to political leaders to persuade them.

<h3>Alternating Current Circuits by Sa Bendong</h3>
<p>— Shi E</p>
<p>(Ministry-approved university textbook, published by Zhengzhong Book Company, priced at fourteen [currency unit])</p>
<p>Among various engineering fields, electrical engineering is more difficult to study, because what it explores always includes the relationship between time and space. It changes in an instant, and when circuit networks are interconnected, mutual induction occurs, making the problem more complicated. Therefore, we must rely on physical phenomena to distinguish the essence of its nature on the one hand, and apply advanced mathematical principles to deduce its quantity on the other. It is quite difficult for beginners to achieve this in one step. Among them, the course of alternating current circuits is a necessary step for those who study electrical engineering, and it is also the most important required course for the electrical engineering department. Without sufficient preparation in advance, it will be difficult to study power or telecommunications engineering itself, and there will be difficulties that cannot be dealt with. It is a pity that such books are not yet available in China, and we have to rely on European and American works, which is regrettable.</p>
<p>Recently, Zhengzhong Book Company has published a book on alternating current circuits, which is a great celebration for the engineering community in China today. The book is an elaborately crafted masterpiece by Mr. Sa Bendong, a Chinese authority on physics. The entire book progresses from the shallow to the deep, and the explanations are detailed and clear. It can be read smoothly without the need for advanced mathematics. Moreover, the writing style is lively and fluent, and reading it does not give people the dry feeling of ordinary science books. In particular, the method of using complex numbers to express alternating current potential, current, and power has unique advantages.</p>
<p>The content of the book begins with complex numbers in the first chapter, discussing in detail the methods of their calculation and application. The second chapter describes sinusoidal potential and current, deducing the main formulas, giving readers a clear basic concept. Chapters three to five describe the complex value significance of the main constants in the circuit, such as impedance admittance, etc. The application of complex value calculation for electric power is discussed in a special chapter, which is very detailed. Starting from chapter six, more complex problems are discussed. First, the mutual transformation and calculation of equivalent circuits and their applications are described. Chapter seven describes mutual inductance and transformers, so that readers can first have a full understanding of the basic principles of AC motors. Chapter eight describes the transient state of the circuit, starting from the initial differential equations, first DC, then AC, and finally discussing complex composite circuits, from simple to iron, so that readers can compare before and after, which is convenient for recollection. Chapter nine describes the balance, transmission, and power measurement of multi-phase systems. The last chapter describes harmonics, detailing how to decompose a periodic waveform into multiple sinusoidal forms, and then discusses the various effects of non-sinusoidal waves and various analysis methods of harmonics.</p>
<p>Writing a book is difficult, and proofreading is not easy. This is generally recognized by the experienced publishing industry. The various symbols used in the book are various, and each has a special meaning. A slight difference can often lose the original meaning. Although the book cannot be completely free of errors, it is truly commendable in terms of today's domestic publishing standards. Only those who have a thorough research on this subject and rich publishing experience can take on this task.</p>
<p>In summary, this book is a good work on alternating current circuits. Compared with Lawrence Principe of Alternating Currents, a famous American work, it is more suitable as a textbook for universities, because there are more materials and it meets the needs. The attached exercises are convenient for teaching and are especially characteristic.</p>
<h3>Introduction and Review of Xin Jiaxuan's Chronicle</h3>
<p>— Chang Mo</p>
<p>Compiled by Deng Guangming, published by Commercial Press</p>
<p>I like Xin Jiaxuan's poems the most. During the Anti-Japanese War, wandering in various regions of the rear area, while traveling through mountains and rivers, while fleeing from enemy air raids and crouching in valleys or by streams and springs, I never forgot to carry Jiaxuan's poems with me. Reading his poems, I can imagine his character: mounting a horse to kill thieves, writing poems after dismounting, passionate and unrestrained. Therefore, I am more willing to know the details of his life's deeds.</p>
<p>In recent years, I have tried to collect and buy some treatises on Jiaxuan, whether they are comments on Jiaxuan's works or narrations of Jiaxuan's life. I have collected more than ten kinds of short articles and monographs, but very few can make me feel satisfied. Last winter, a friend in Peiping bought me a chronicle of Jiaxuan written by Zheng Qian, and I bought a critical biography of Jiaxuan written by Xu Jiarui in Shanghai. After a little reading, I felt even more "worse and worse." This spring, I bought two books newly published by Commercial Press, the chronicle of Jiaxuan written by Mr. Deng Guangming and the "Collection of Xin Jiaxuan's Poems and Essays" compiled and proofread by him. My wish was greatly satisfied. Mr. Deng's two books can almost be said to be "the ultimate" in the search for Xin Jiaxuan's life deeds.</p>
<p>I once read Mr. Deng's "Xin Jiaxuan's Friends" in the first issue of Fudan Journal. He examined that Xin Jiaxuan had as many as 200 friends during his lifetime. I have been admiring the author's ability to collect widely, but in this chronicle of Jiaxuan, the breadth of his investigation of Jiaxuan's life deeds, the number of creations, and the degree of meticulousness and comprehensiveness are far beyond "Examination of Jiaxuan's Friends."</p>
<p>Jiaxuan's poems and essays have been lost for a long time; the Song History biography is not detailed in narration. Therefore, regarding Xin Jiaxuan's life, it is not only difficult to seek some trivial daily routines, but also his "two-point commander, three-drive envoy" (Jiaxuan's self-statement in the girder text of his new residence) in the first half of his life, and his experiences as Fujian Appeasement Envoy, Zhejiang East Appeasement Envoy, and Zhenjiang Prefect in the second half of his life are all important responsibilities on their own. Whether it is for Jiaxuan himself or for the military and political situation at the time, it cannot be regarded as irrelevant, but people who have previously narrated Jiaxuan's life, including Xin Qitai in the middle of the Qing Dynasty and the academic master Liang Qichao in the late Qing Dynasty and early Republic of China, have not been able to verify these things clearly. It must be because the books were missing and difficult to engage in, which can be imagined. And in this chronicle of Jiaxuan, Mr. Deng quoted a large number of "Drafts of the Song Hui Yao" compiled by Xu Song and some local chronicles compiled by the Song people, such as Chunxi Sanshan Zhi, Jiading Zhenjiang Zhi, Jingding Jiankang Zhi, Kaiqing Linting Zhi, etc., not only have extremely definite records of Jiaxuan's years of officialdom in various places, but also have extremely detailed explanations of the reasons for each of his transfers and dismissals. The author is at ease, and all the key issues, which have always been controversial and inconsistent, have all been easily resolved.</p>
<p>In addition, some matters that are closely related to Jiaxuan himself, such as Jiaxuan and Dang Huaiying jointly studying with Liu Zhan in Haozhou when they were young, rather than studying with Cai Bojian, this chronicle quotes the small biographies of Dang and Liu in Yuan Yishan's "Zhongzhou Collection," which has definitely proved it; After Jiaxuan returned to the south, he married the daughter of Fan Bangyan, another loyal man who returned to the south, as his wife. This chronicle got a clear answer based on Mu's Lingyang Collection and Liu Zai's Mantang Wenji; Jiaxuan would participate in Cai Guang's affairs with poetry, and found the mother's family of this legend from Chen Mo's Huaigu Lu (in the past, it was all quoted from Xu Qiu's Cihua Congbian); The deep friendship between Jiaxuan and Zhu Xi has found more annotations from the Zhu Zi Yu Lei; Jiaxuan was once deeply involved in the hinterland of the Jin Kingdom when he was young, and he also tried to reconnaissance the military situation of the Jin Kingdom when he guarded the sighing river in his later years. I have also found Jiaxuan's long surprise self-statement in Cheng Bi's Mingshui. There are countless examples like this, all of which are creations in this chronicle.</p>
<p>Strangely, if the above-mentioned issues are what everyone who narrates Jiaxuan's life must examine, then the above-mentioned books should also be what everyone must check, but the fact is that only Mr. Deng has really checked and examined them. For example, the book "Drafts of the Song Hui Yao" was only compiled in the era of Xin Qitai, and has not been printed in the era of Liang Qichao. It is natural that the two authors did not refer to it, but the books of Zheng Qian and Xu Jiarui were recently written, and both of them did not know that there is such a book in the world. Is it strange?</p>
<p>Let me say it again, although Mr. Deng has done his best to collect widely, I can still contribute a supplementary material. In the biographical records of the characters in Yuan Ren Gan Qin's "Qi Cheng", there is a small biography of Jiaxuan, in which there is a sentence "Song people use the words coarse and barren to see it and do not use it", and it is also said that "Song Shi Lu Bi Youan praised Han Du's use of troops, defeated Du, and Youan was guilty of public opinion." These all seem to be worth quoting in Jiaxuan's chronicle. Recently, I saw that Mr. Deng also has articles supplementing Xin's spectrum, I don't know if this article has been added?</p>
<h3>Introducing "Biological Interest"</h3>
<p>— Di Shan</p>
<p>(Written by Yao Yuqiu, newly published by Kaiming Bookstore)</p>
<p>Writing texts of scientific interest in a literary style is called "scientific essays," which was first advocated in the "Taibai" semi-monthly magazine founded in 1935. Later, this type of text was gradually loved by readers, and more and more authors were engaged in writing.</p>
<p>Ten years ago, Kaiming Bookstore published Jia Zuzhang's "Biological Sketches," Ke Shi's "Flowers, Birds, Fish," and Tao Bingzhen's "Insect Anecdotes," etc. These collections of "scientific essays" have always been books that readers love to read. In March of this year, Kaiming newly published Yao Yuqiu's "Biological Interest."</p>
<p>This book is included in the "Kaiming Youth Series," and it is a book that uses simple words to express the interest in biological forms, properties, and other aspects.</p>
<p>The book contains a total of 21 articles, 14 of which are related to animal records, and 7 are texts describing plants. In terms of animals, from the extremely small fleas and lice to the huge body of the elephant, each article has newer research. The author's purpose is not only to make readers recognize each animal, but also hopes to arouse interest in studying biology. Therefore, the author's text has been refined.</p>
<p>For example, the beginning of the article "Cuckoo", the author's text is very beautiful:</p>
<p>——Spring is gone, the weather gradually changes from mild to hot, and the earth has also been re-clothed in a set of dark green clothes. In the thick willow, in addition to seeing swallows flying like shuttles from time to time, we can also see a gray-black cuckoo in the forest. It is the messenger of summer, and it has now begun to broadcast its mournful cry to the world.</p>
<p>As in recording the sound of cicadas</p>
<p>——It is sometimes loud and high-pitched, sometimes passionate and clear and secluded, bringing people a feeling of elegance everywhere, and dispelling a lot of sorrow in our hearts.</p>
<p>One of the articles on plants, "Plum", can be said to be pure "prose". When we heard the famous sentence "Dark fragrance floats in the dusk," we could not help but imagine an old and elegant posture from the author's pen.</p>
<p>People who are accustomed to reading textbooks on botany or biology and feel boring, I recommend you to read this "Biological Interest". You will definitely be happy to think that the biological world is so beautiful and lovely!</p>
<h3>Reading "Love of Life and Death"</h3>
<p>— Liu Zhao</p>
<p>Written by Lin Shuhua, published by New Century Publishing House</p>
<p>When "Love of Life and Death" was published in the Excellent Couples Monthly on a regular basis, it was titled "Full-length Creation"; but when I finished reading the single book, I only felt that the whole book was more like the author's autobiography than a creative novel.</p>
<p>I don't know if other readers agree with my view after reading this book. And I also have a prejudice, thinking that if you read this book with an autobiographical perspective, readers are more likely to be moved by the plot of the book. Generally speaking, moving readers with the plot is not necessarily the author's greatest success; but I think that the success of every literary work is based on arousing readers' resonance as one of the main conditions; then, the author obtains readers' resonance through the narration of the plot. It is not necessarily a kind of writing skill. On this point, the author, Ms. Lin Shuhua, has been successful.</p>
<p>The entire book of "Love of Life and Death" has a total of twenty-two armies, starting with "Life Experience" and ending with "Eternal Regret". The entire story is about a heroine and a hero falling in love, getting married, starting a family, starting a career, and finally the male protagonist dying of illness and the female protagonist mourning the death. This side writes about the heroine and hero's hard struggle due to the lack of freedom of love under the feudal forces, writes about the heroine's self-sacrifice for the country during the Anti-Japanese War, writes about the hero's courage, integrity, and unremitting efforts, writes about the joy of both parties overcoming difficulties and combining, writes about the hero's dedication to the society and the family, completely forgetting the service spirit of "small self", writes about the heroine inheriting her husband's will after mourning the death, independently supporting the life of the family, and even working as a seamstress, and finally writes about the tragedy of the heroine unfortunately suffering from lung disease and falling into desperation. In all this, the author writes very sincerely, very delicately, and very movingly. I think that after reading this book, every reader will not resonate with the heroine, I am afraid it is extremely rare!</p>
<p>In terms of the narration of the entire story, some people may feel that the author's writing style is very similar to the old-fashioned novels, but in fact the author can jump out of the pattern of vulgar love novels. The author's writing style is fresh and charming. Among the works of female writers I have read, the author has quite a unique style. For example:</p>
<p>"I think of our premarital life: In order to fight for our free life, you have constantly encouraged me and comforted me. We still endured many oppressions from the outside world with tears; we also gritted our teeth and made the greatest struggle with the world; threats and lures, soft deception and coercion; any obstruction could not separate our loving hearts; any blow could not separate our connected feelings. Year after year! Sent away the Mid-Autumn Festival reunion moon, and ushered in the early spring flowers of next year; watched the flowers bloom, and watched the flowers fall…. In the tenth year, we struggled out of the old bound circle and began to fly into our ideal, free world." (Eternal Regret)</p>
<p>Of course, the author's writing style is not without its debatable points. In my opinion, it seems that some places are too procrastinating, and some places have too many exciting words, which is quite suspected of abusing emotions. But according to my guess, the author is probably a passionate woman, then it is no wonder that she unintentionally reveals her emotions everywhere. However, in terms of the work itself, we really have to think that it is a small flaw.</p>
<p>According to the author's preface, the author has only received education that has not yet graduated from middle school; this is quite surprising. Today, the low writing ability of young people has become a recognized fact; but then, with an education that has not yet graduated from middle school, the author can write such a moving autobiography, which is really rare and must be considered a writing genius.</p>
<p>Although, I think that the thing of "genius" should also be appropriately cultivated in today's literary world; if it is blindly praised, the author's genius is very easy to wither immediately. After all, genius is genius, without the addition of hard work and effort, no matter what, it cannot reach the realm of success. Although "Love of Life and Death" is a rare masterpiece, it is still far from the realm of complete success, which is what critics should pay special attention to. Especially the author himself, should also have the same self-awareness, can not think that the existing progress is satisfied, should continue to work hard, continue to improve; do not accept all external criticisms without any opinion, forgetting their own actual ability. This is my most sincere advice to the author.</p>
<p>(Editor's note: Regarding this book, I also received a review from Mr. Yan Yanfang, but because of the limited space, it cannot be published at the same time. I apologize. Mr. Yan encouraged the author and said: "I want to comfort the author: Your life experience is bitter, but there are many people in society who sympathize with you. In the future, I hope you will put the past twelve years behind you and continue to live and strive!"</p>

<h3>Assigned Essay</h3>
<p>— Nianhong</p>
<p>Many educators say this: In general, the compositions in elementary and secondary schools are mostly based on teachers predetermining the topics, and then teaching students to expand on the topic. This approach often limits students' thinking, so they cannot write good articles.</p>
<p>I think this statement specifically refers to elementary and secondary school students, and perhaps it is correct, because the thinking of elementary and secondary school students is not yet sound, and they cannot use it freely. Therefore, they have to revolve around the meaning of the topics given by the teachers, and cannot escape their scope. However, if it refers to general writing, then it is not necessarily so. Writing is the expression of thought, and it represents what people think and do. Thought can never be limited by anything, so how can the meaning in writing be blocked by topics? The same target object, with different standpoints, each person has different views. Botanists think of the species when they see a forest; craftsmen think of which are the materials for beams and pillars, and which are not suitable for great purposes; however, in the eyes of poets, it is a great source of material for praising nature.</p>
<p>Of course, topics can limit a part of thought. But the room for maneuvering is still very large, and there are still many articles that can be written, if you are willing to spend some effort to study it. I have heard that once a certain magazine solicited articles with a very strange topic, just the word "one." As a result, among the two excellent works published, one talked about the necessity of the world being one family, and the world being united to eliminate all suspicions among human beings; the other was exactly the opposite. It emphasized individualism, believing that only by taking the individual as the starting point is the shortcut to success. We will not discuss who is writing correctly and who is saying the wrong thing. At least we can see that even extremely strange topics can still be developed to express one's own thoughts and opinions.</p>
<p>A view in society today is that it excessively emphasizes the limiting ability of topics, believing that once the topic is set, all efforts cannot escape its scope, and therefore passively feel that it is a waste of effort, and it is better to let it go. We naturally cannot ignore the big topics. In fact, there are many things that are closely related to it and cannot be solved alone, but it does not mean that there is no way or hope because of it. As long as you do your best, you can still find a way to achieve some success. For example, the person in charge of general organizations always says that the organization cannot exert its effectiveness, which is actually affected by economic difficulties. The economic situation of various organizations is indeed a fatal blow to the development of the cause, but it is not necessarily correct to push all failures to economic problems. In addition to economics, we know that there are still many shortcomings that can be improved, but in fact they have not been improved.</p>
<p>In short, we cannot blame the limitation of the topic and forget our own responsibility. We must know that only when everyone fulfills their responsibilities can we break the limitation of the topic.</p>
<h3>Wang Xiangqi's Handwritten Letter</h3>
<p>— Qian Dacheng</p>
<p>I have a letter from the old man Wang Xiangqi, Wang 　Yun, which is not included in the published collections of Wang's letters. It was addressed to my maternal great-grandfather, Zeng Gong Zhuruo (whose given name was Qingpu). The time was the eighteenth day of the sixth lunar month in the first year of the Republic of China (the postal cancellation was August 1st in the Gregorian calendar, still using the Qing Dynasty postal stamps). 　Yun lived in Shantang, Xiangtan, and Zeng Gong lived in Hengzhou. Zeng Gong had served as the prefect of Changsha and Hengzhou, and had often associated with 　Yun. It was repeatedly mentioned in the Xiangqilou Diary. My mother told me: Whenever 　Yun went to the prefect's yamen, the favored Zhou Ma would always follow. 　Yun's braid was thin and small like a spring earthworm. He supported Zhou Ma's shoulder and entered. 　When Yun sat down, Zhou Ma also sat down. His friends laughed and joked with him, but he was not offended. Every time he came, he must ask for snacks, and he would specifically ask for the hand-made snacks of Gong's concubine. This letter was written during the time of change, and Hunan had been restored. There is a saying in the book: "Brother Tan Pi has been out of contact for a long time. Zhou Sheng is the first person to advocate killing him. If he knows that he is in contact with his younger brother, he will definitely pull him into it. ... Yantang will not last long, and your matter will naturally be settled. ... There are many unemployed people everywhere, and there is no reason to let them all freeze and starve to death; leave it to fate, and I really have some insights. At this time, it is not allowed to plan for next year." Tan Shixiong refers to Mr. Tan Yankai, and Zhou Sheng refers to the first Hunan governor, Zhou. Zhou was later killed, and another person was killed after him. The people then supported Mr. Yan Kai to take the lead. At that time, the situation in Hunan was chaotic, and people were panic-stricken. It had entered a state of terror. He firmly declined, but he could not get away, and then he went out of the mountain. His family gathered and cried to send him off. The saying of the melon vines in the letter is not an exaggeration; it is also a last resort to leave it to fate. It also said: "Now everyone regards foreign countries as icebergs, and foreign countries regard themselves as Mount Tai, to reassure the people." Strange words are absurd, and I don't know how to explain them. It also said: "There is nothing to send in the mountains. I have cut more than a hundred melons, but I have not found a good one." Mr. Yang Wuyang please;"Cutting melons, etc., the person holding the knife must be Zhou Ma." This statement is especially comforting. 　Yun has always been known as a master of humor. He was born in times of turmoil and used humor to cover up his endless grief and resentment. His laughter, anger, and scolding all became articles. Tracing its original intention, those who still discuss the ancients should deeply regret it. There are many anecdotes in his life, and many contemporary sages can tell them, so I will not write them here.</p>
<h3>The Zhong Leng Spring of Jinshan</h3>
<p>— Shuiqing</p>
<p>Jinshan has the Zhong Leng Spring. The spring water is used to brew tea, which was famous all over the world in the past. This spring is probably located on the south side of Jinshan Mountain, and it is now difficult to find it; as for a well in Jinshan Temple, called "The First Spring in the World," it is definitely not the world-famous Zhong Leng Spring. It is just that the monks use it to pretend to ordinary tourists. It is said that only when truly special guests come, will the abbot be willing to use the real Zhong Leng Spring water to make tea for the guests. The so-called "Tea, brewing tea, brewing good tea, brewing my good tea," (Note) Monks treat guests according to their status.</p>
<p>According to the New Tea Water Record, there is such a story: "During the Daizong Dynasty (Tang Dynasty), Li Xiuqing was sent to Huzhou, and met the recluse Lu Hongjian in Yangzhou. Li had long been familiar with Lu's name, so he went to the prefecture and arrived at the Yangzhou Post Station. He was about to eat, and Li said: 'Mr. Lu is good at tea, and is famous all over the world. Moreover, the Nanling Water (that is, Zhong Leng Spring Water) of Yangzhou is especially wonderful. It is a rare encounter in a thousand years. Can we wait for it?' He ordered the soldiers to carry bottles and boats, and went deep into Nanling. Lu held the utensils and waited for it. Soon the water arrived, and he raised the water with a ladle and said: 'It is the river, but not the Nanling water.' Then he poured it into the basin. When it was half full, Lu suddenly stopped it and said, 'This is the Nanling water.' The soldiers were shocked and knelt down and said: 'I brought it to Nanling, and the boat was swaying and the water was overturned. Fearing that it would be less, I added the water from the bank to it. The recluse is so insightful, how dare I hide it?' This is really a magical thing. No wonder this recluse Lu was honored as the Sage of Tea by later generations. He could even distinguish what kind of water it was after mixing two kinds of water together, and he studied the Zhong Leng Water of Jinshan so thoroughly.</p>
<p>What is the taste of Zhong Leng Spring Water? It is said to be "light, clear, fragrant, and smooth, both sweet and cool"; if it is sweet but not cool, it is definitely not Zhong Leng Spring Water. When Emperor Qianlong of the Qing Dynasty toured Jinshan, he once wrote a poem "Trying Zhong Leng Spring" to praise it.</p>
<p>In addition, there is also a magical story in the Taiping Guangji: When Li Deyu was the prime minister in the Tang Dynasty, a good friend was sent on a business trip to Zhenjiang. Li asked him to bring back a bottle of Zhong Leng Spring Water from Jinshan when he returned. The man waited until the day his official business in Zhenjiang was completed, set sail to return, and forgot about it after getting drunk. It was not until the ship arrived in Nanjing that he probably woke up and remembered what the prime minister Li Deyu had asked him to do. However, the ship had arrived in Nanjing, and it was inconvenient to go back, so he took a bottle of water from the Yangtze River in Nanjing, brought it to Chang'an, and gave it to Li Deyu, thinking that he could shirk his responsibility. Unexpectedly, Li Deyu drank the tea made with this water and sighed, "It's quite like the water under the Shicheng in Jianye!" The man couldn't explain it, so he had to thank him. —— Li 　　seems to be very shrewd, he 　can distinguish the taste of the water at the bottom of Zhenjiang and Nanjing, but this also shows how thoroughly they studied the way of drinking tea.</p>
<p>Not to mention that few 　guests know about Zhong Leng Spring Water now, I am afraid that only a few monks in Jinshan Temple know about it, because after a long time, they only know the well of "The First Spring in the World."</p>
<p>(Note) This is the story of Zheng Banqiao's waxing annual righteousness: It is said that when he first traveled in the mountains, the abbot did not know his great name, and only treated him as an ordinary guest. Later, he gradually realized that he was not an ordinary person, and until he knew his great name, he was especially respectful. Therefore, when he was leaving, he gave the abbot a couplet, called "Sit, please sit, please sit up, please Mr. sit up; Tea, brew tea, brew good tea, brew my good tea." It shows that the abbot monk treats guests in four levels.</p>
<h3>The Art of Invisibility</h3>
<p>— Fang Ping</p>
<p>When I was young, reading novels of gods and monsters, the most admired and envied thing was the art of invisibility. Using a magic talisman, or chanting a few spells, one can do whatever one wants in front of other people's eyes: kill enemies, take treasures, steal kisses from beautiful women, but others see nothing, and are at a loss. It is truly "wonderful" and "happy." Therefore, when I was young, I often had strange dreams of meeting gods who would teach me the art of invisibility at night. Later, as I grew older, I gradually understood that the so-called "art of invisibility" is just a ridiculous fantasy of novelists, and there is absolutely no one in the world who can hide their physical body. As a result, the golden seal of "art of invisibility" imprinted in my mind when I was young quickly faded.</p>
<p>However, recently I was browsing an English science magazine and accidentally discovered a scientific oddity, saying that the "art of invisibility" has become a true fact. At that time, I was a little surprised, but perhaps because my level of knowledge was higher than before, "doubt" immediately challenged surprise in my heart, so I translated it at will so that people in the scientific community could point out whether it was true or false, possible or impossible. The following is that "oddity":</p>
<p>Italian scientist Professor Mansini has recently invented a light that can hide everything in the human body. It can not only penetrate the muscles of the human body like X-rays, but also further penetrate the bones in the human body. This kind of light, Professor Mansini tentatively named "Mansini Light One."</p>
<p>One day, Professor Sney invited several famous scientists to his home for dinner. Just as the guests were seated one by one, everyone couldn't help but shout out in surprise, because everyone suddenly disappeared the other guests at the table next to them, and felt that they were sitting alone. But in less than three minutes, this strange phenomenon disappeared. The guests were at a loss. It was not until the host said with a smile that he was experimenting with his new invention that everyone suddenly realized. The next day, many newspapers published this "marvel."</p>
<p>According to Professor Mansini, this kind of invisible light is emitted by a radioactive element similar to a spindle. He has done many experiments. The most amazing one was that when the chairs next to the table were clearly visible, the clothes on the chairs suddenly disappeared.</p>
<p>If this "marvel" is indeed a true fact, then when everyone uses "Mansini Light" to steal, commit murder, and even in war, then this world is truly unimaginable.</p>
<h3>Exchanging Calligraphy for Mutton</h3>
<p>Calligraphers are paid for their writing, and the remuneration is usually money in modern times. Zheng Banqiao of the Qing Dynasty stipulated that each piece of calligraphy would be paid a certain amount of silver. However, there are also those who do not exchange calligraphy for money, such as Wang Youjun, who wrote the Tao Te Ching for a Taoist priest in Shanyin in exchange for white and lovely geese, which also had its value. During the Song Dynasty, there was a man named Han Zongru, who was an old glutton who loved meat. Every time he obtained a letter from Su Dongpo, he would exchange it for several pounds of mutton to eat. Huang Luzhi jokingly said to Su Dongpo: In the past, Wang Youjun's calligraphy was called "model for rubbing," but now Zongru exchanges your calligraphy for mutton, so your calligraphy can be called "Exchanging Calligraphy for Mutton." One day, Su Dongpo was in the Hanlin Academy, busy writing, when Zong Jiao sent a brief letter, intending to repay him, hoping to get a reply from Su Dongpo. The messenger urged him very urgently. Su Dongpo smiled and said, "Tell the official that today is a day of no slaughter." Su Dongpo's humor can be passed down. (Xiaopeng)</p>

<h3>Anecdotes of Sa Zhenbing</h3>
<p>— Ziruo</p>
<p>My father, a veteran of the navy, has been taught by Sa Zhenbing for many years, and has a lot of sincere feelings about past events. Therefore, I record them to fill the free talk. My father said, "When Sa was the captain of a merchant ship, I was only in my early twenties. It has been more than forty years since then. During this long period, I have met countless teachers, elders, and officials, but most of them were just teachers, elders, and officials. But when I occasionally think of Teacher Sa, I immediately see a kind and friendly old man in front of me. I don't know why this is the case, but I reflect on myself and feel that I dare not lightly overstep the norms in terms of my behavior, speech, and actions. I feel that I am influenced by Teacher Sa. In peacetime, I once privately tried to evaluate him, and the most fashionable word now is democracy. Someone like Teacher Sa may firmly believe that he has never deviated from democratic behavior in his life. Confucius discussed human nature, saying that only the wise and the foolish do not change. Master Sa is truly wise. Mencius explained the definition of an adult, saying that he does not lose the heart of a child. Master Sa is truly an adult. It is believable that from his childhood to his ninetieth birthday, he has never lost the heart of a child. This is my own opinion, and I am determined to believe it. I was quite expected by Teacher Sa in my youth, but I chose the wrong career and ended up being mediocre. I remember when I transferred from a merchant ship to the navy, a group of twelve people went to Beijing to take the exam. On the clear morning of our departure, Teacher Sa specially prepared Western pastries and asked us to have a meal to see us off. During the meal, a classmate suddenly innocently asked, 'Mr. Sa, we have never been to Nanjing. What should we do when we get there?' The teacher raised his head and thought for a while, looked around, and pointed to me, saying, 'Don't worry, just ask him.' How did the teacher know that I could be competent for this matter? I was really flattered and didn't know what to do. From this, it can be seen that the students' personalities and structures are always being observed in silence. Therefore, from then on, I always kept a mind of awe and caution. I also recall that when Yuan Shikai was negotiating the Twenty-One Demands with Japan, Teacher Sa was sent to the Hukou naval fleet to comfort the troops (at that time, the warships were concentrated there for a joint exercise). He was prepared to fight Japan to the death. The people were in turmoil, and the situation was tense. When the warships were swearing oaths and comforting the troops in Chu, he knew that I was an intern on the warship. That night, after returning to the flagship (Jiangli), he came to the flagship to order, and the English meaning was roughly: I want to see my student ×××. The captain informed me to send me over to the warship by speedboat. When I arrived, he asked me about my situation, treated me with Western pastries, knew that the allowance was too little (eighteen yuan for food), encouraged me to study hard, gave me special comfort, and before leaving, he gave me a translated copy of Washington's oath, and asked me to read it through myself. After I heard it, he took it back, folded it neatly, and the corners were not even a centimeter off, and then handed it back to me. This kind of solemn and careful expression is still vivid in my mind when I occasionally think of it."</p>
<h3>Reunited with Yan Dajiechou in Yuyao, Both Temples Covered in Frost, Feeling Like Worlds Apart</h3>
<p>— Sanmu</p>
<p>My ambition has faded away in old age, who would believe that I was once so magnanimous? Don't blame the heroic spirit of the southeast for being exhausted, look at this person with a stooped back and a mottled head.</p>
<p>I once took my guests with short robes, brocade oars and embroidered rudder blurred in my dreams. To this day, I have exhausted the hands of slaying dragons. Who remembers A Shu in the twilight? (You once traveled with Taibao A Shu)</p>
<p>I send my feelings to Zhaitou, the spring tide rises like a jade pot in the evening. In my spare time, I look at the shadow of my hair by the stove, and I expect no more dreams of traveling the rivers and lakes.</p>
<p>For ten years, I generously bought rouge, and it was not too late to return home after hardship. I specially came to Zhaitou when the spring wine was ripe, and I want you to cherish your beautiful eyebrows.</p>
<p>Ren Ansui wrote this casually during a drinking session, showing it to Uncle Sanmu Fan, Jiechou.</p>
<p>We have opened our hearts for another time in a hundred years. The lamp is set in the small building, but the ashes fly away. I am glad that there are no friends or clubs to hook and connect us. We can come to the seat calmly with white hair.</p>
<p>Who made the wine battle force people to be proud? Come and deal with it, remember this spine. The old hall can bet drunk with a troop, how can it be said that the heroic spirit has not completely disappeared?</p>
<h3>Qing Lei Studies Painting</h3>
<p>In the afternoon of the twenty-first, Ms. Shen, a female representative, chaired the National Assembly. According to the "gossip" published in the local newspapers, "Shen's enforcement is very strict and exceptionally polite, and she repeatedly said 'thank you' and 'sorry', which is truly polite and not strange. She can grasp the psychology of the representatives." As far as I know, this attitude and these humble words are often found among friends in the academic community, and not only among women.</p>
<p>Anyone who has received Western-style education or is accustomed to associating with European and American intellectuals knows that there is a natural courtesy in the questions of friends and acquaintances, that is, there are commonly used words. If a person benefits, he says Thank you, and if he is sorry, he says Excuse me. Regardless of the size or importance of the matter, even slightly related words and actions should always be prepared with this kind of verbal usage. This is true even for teachers towards students. When I was in school, my English teacher, Mr. Whittick, often used these two words to his classmates, and taught the students about the etiquette they should know. Although we do not follow them one by one (the reason is that except for the teacher, there is no need for them in the old-fashioned environment, and if we suddenly imitate them to people who are not accustomed to it, it will cause surprise), we have already known and kept them in mind. Also, when Chinese officials and Western teachers socialized, we often translated for them, and often felt the difficulty of "getting the meaning across". Sometimes it is a respectful word on one side, but it is a casual word on the other. Sometimes it is a very familiar word here, but it is stiff and incomprehensible there. It is precisely because I am responsible for this kind of translation that I pay attention to the differences and similarities between the words and sentences on both sides and examine and revise them. Therefore, I can easily distinguish the origin of Chinese words that have a Western tone.</p>
<p>From student life, I entered the life of teaching. Among my colleagues, there were Westerners, students who had studied in the West, and those who had not studied abroad but had grown accustomed to Western manners. Once, at a tea party, colleagues gathered together. One person was late. After entering the door, he socialized with the Westerners, repeatedly saying Excuse me, and repeatedly said "I'm sorry" to the Chinese people. Both are apologies and respect, with the same meaning, but the words are not consistent. Excuse me should be translated as "forgive me", which is a polite way to ask for forgiveness from the other party. As for "I'm sorry", it only states the fault of one's own side, and implicitly contains the meaning of asking for forgiveness. However, in Chinese habits (verbally), people always say "I'm sorry" or "I'm not worthy" more often, and rarely say "forgive me" (this does not apply to written form and those with context). Therefore, when Excuse me should be said in Western language, "I'm sorry" in Chinese is understood by everyone. As for Thank you meaning "thank you", both the transliteration and translation are the same, and no detailed explanation is needed. (Westerners often use you to the other party, which is not disrespectful, even to elders. This is because the word you was originally a respectful term, equivalent to "you" in Beijing, while "you" in Chinese is not very polite, so it is better to omit it. Fortunately, the second person can be omitted and understood.)</p>
<p>I don't know what kind of education the representative Shen in this telegram received, and her usual behavior, since I am far away. But I assume that she is a student who has studied abroad or is accustomed to Western etiquette, then her so-called "thank you" and "sorry" are common examples of verbal words in receptions or gatherings, and are not surprising. If you pay attention to other aspects, you can find many. It is well known that Dr. Hu Shih always has a humble and elegant demeanor, and even in the smallest programs, he often hears the words "thank you" and "sorry". Dr. Mei Wan Hua is always humble, and since returning to China from studying in the United States and often receiving foreign guests, his movements and interactions have completely followed the Western-style gentleman's demeanor, and similar oral words can be verified everywhere. It is the so-called habit becomes nature.</p>
