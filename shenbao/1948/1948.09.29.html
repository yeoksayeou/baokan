<p>〔本報南京廿八日電〕前行政院長張羣，廿八日晚八時在中央廣播電台播講「日本觀感」，原詞如次：</p>
<p>各位同胞：本人這次赴日本去視察，國內同胞都很關心，國外人士也非常注意。在日本的行動與言論，一方面得到同情和鼓勵，一方面也引起揣測和批許。回國以來承各界友人的訪問，不能一一答復，今日特地將赴日視察所得的材料，略為整理，並從整個亞洲的前途和中國應有的努力着眼，提出意見，對全國同胞作一個總括的報吿。希望這一篇報吿，可以供國人對日本問題的認識，以及政府對日本問題決策的一點參考。</p>
<p>日本自明治維新以後，八十多年，一方面本於歷史相傳的神道和武士道糅合而成的軍國釉神，他方面吸收了近代的科學知識，作為工業和軍備的基礎，這兩種工具，被日本的軍閥財閥政客的集團所利用，以「地陜人多生產不足」為理由，對內刺激國民，對外作為擴大侵略的口實，中國與日本地理接近，便首當其衝。自從甲午戰後五十多年間，中國始終在日本侵略鐵蹄之下，十七年國民革命北伐成功，中國國民革命的力量，與日本帝國主義的力量，便從側面轉入正面的衝突。從九一八到七七，這個衝突達到了無可轉園的地步。我全國同胞毅然決然，奮起抗戰，八年之中，中國生命財產的損失慘重，不可數計。但在此次戰爭之中，軍國主義的日本崩潰了，中國百年累積的國際枷鎖解除了，而亞洲多數的民族，也獲得了獨立自由，這便是此次戰爭所得到的成果，也便是中國八年苦戰犧牲對於亞洲和世界的貢獻。</p>
<p>日本投降之後，盟軍進佔日本，負責商討對日管制政策的機關，是設在華盛頓的遠東委員會。而在日本實際執行管制政策的，是以麥克阿瑟將軍為統帥的盟軍總部。過去日本在軍閥財閥政客統治之下，肆行侵略，中國受禍最深，現在日本在盟軍管制之下將成為怎樣一個國家？中國自然特別關切。不幸戰爭結束已滿三年，因為世界局勢的複雜，和盟國意見的分歧，對日和會，如同對德和會一樣，還沒有能够召開。中日之間消息隔膜，從中國方面來翻察日本的情形，很難得到淸楚確實的印象，中國人士，不免從極度關切之中，發生了顧慮和懷疑，因而感覺不安。究竟日本的軍國主義是否可能乘着國際局勢的變動而復活？日本的民主政治是否能够眞正建立？將來會不會再回復到極權政治的舊路？日本經濟如果復興，是否能使日本重整武裝，或者妨害中國的經濟建設？盟軍總部對日管制政策是否失於寬大？有沒有錯誤？疑問重重，而反美扶日運動就乘着這種懷疑顧慮和不安的心理，在各地發生了。本人在抗戰以前，已多年沒有到日本，前年從美國就醫回國路過日本，止住了三天，沒有來得及觀察。上述幾個問題，我個人不能提出一個可以自信的答案，也沒有得到一個可以滿意的答案，為了想要明瞭戰後日本的眞實情形，同時又承亞東協會同人的鼓勵，所以才有此次赴日視察之行。</p>
<p>我從八月廿一日到達日本，九月十三日回國，在日本視察三個星期，與麥克阿瑟將軍會晤四次，並聽取日本朝野各政黨領袖及各界重要人士的報吿。總合這些會談報吿，與盟軍總部中國駐日代表團各方面所供給的資料及實地見聞所得，我想把戰後日本情形，在下面簡括報吿一下：</p>
<p>解除武裝辦得澈底</p>
<p>在軍備上，盟軍佔領日本的時候，日本領土內還有軍人二百七十萬人，在短期內卽已解除武裝。　國的僑俘七百多萬人，在相當時期內，也已經陸續遺歸鄉里，分別安　復員。陸海空軍事機構全部裁撤，軍艦飛機要塞和其他武裝設備，也都沒收或者銷毀了。至於一般所注意的軍港，機場，警察，以及海上保安廳等問題，就我所知道的實際情形來說：日本的軍港，德山港在戰後就已經慶棄了，吳軍港現被英國海軍使用，橫須賀佐世保兩軍港，是美國駐日海軍的主要基地，舞鶴和大凑兩軍港是美國海軍次要基地，以上各港的要塞設備，都已經拆</p>
<p>日本本土的機塲原有兩百多處，盟軍佔領日本後，保留了卅三處作為英美空軍使用，其中有少數為適應需要曾經擴建，其餘都已經改作耕地鹽田，或其他非軍事的用途。</p>
<p>說到警察問題：原來日本警察全部屬於國家，由中央機關統一指揮。現在日本全國有治安警察十二萬五千人，每五人分配手槍一支，其中系屬於中央的只有三萬，分屬於地方的自治警察計九萬五千人，都是自願的職業警察，並無服役年限。事務員書記等三萬人，曾充軍官的不得轉業為警員。此外還有由運輸省管轄的鐵道警察約九千名，由經濟檢査廳管轄的經濟警察約五千名，由勞働省管轄的勞動監督官二千名。總計約十七萬人。</p>
<p>至於海上保安應，現有生要的保安艇二十九艘，速力十海哩，噸位約一百噸，沒有武裝。此外還有五十噸到兩百噸的拖船十五隻，以及廿噸的小艇六十隻，盟軍總部借用的二千噸供應船兩艘。這些船的職務是救護難船，防止走私，和有關恢復燈塔，打撈沉船等等事項。</p>
<p>從上面所述的各種情形來看，盟總三年來對於日本武裝的解除工作，可以說辦得澈底。日本現有的警察，保安船艇，以及所用的槍械數量，都是盟軍總部認為日本維持當前本國海陸秩序最小限度的需要決不够作為日本海陸軍重建的基礎。再就國防軍備的根本條件來看，日本戰敗後業已喪失其原有領土百分之四十三强，煤鐵資源喪失很多，近代戰爭所必需的物資，如石油橡皮等等也一無所有。日本用了數十年的努力，擴張領土，奪取資源所累積而成的一套國防力量，尙且不足以制勝於第二次的世界戰爭，結局是一敗涂地；今日武器更加進步了，戰爭形態又有變更了，日本憑現有的資源與技術來重建一套足以應付下次戰爭的國防力量，眞是一件非常渺茫的事情。（下轉第二版）。</p>

<h3 id="c19">專論　急需解決的東北游資 <a href="#c19" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e19" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">19</a></h3>
<p>— 石士</p>
<p>新幣制推行了已經一月。雖然政府以　　萬鈞之勢，限制物價於八月十九日之水準，但是各地物價仍不免暗中有蠢動之象。有時卽使外表價格不動，但是品質成份却在降低，有時商品在公開市面上（卽按政府限價）幾乎無法購得，形成有行無市的狀態，而要買到貨物必需走黑市的門路。揆其原因不外發行的猛烈增加，造成人民對商品的有效需要的急速膨脹，自從改幣以來，發行增加之速，竟超過以往任何時期。這是足使任何人不能不對金圓前途抱極大隱憂的。</p>
<p>發行的來源一部份固然是由於政府收兌黃金外鈔所放出的，但是主要的恐怕還是政府的軍政支出。在內亂方殷的時候，軍事費用的浩大自然是意中事，但是各項費用是否覆實及是否已盡量節約還待考究，而各地軍費支出尤以東北　　最為駭人聽聞。</p>
<p>東北自　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　所控制的地區僅僅剩長春·藩陽·錦州三個孤立的據點而已。但是我們側聞以長春一彈丸之地，每月的軍政支出卽將達七億金圓之鉅，東北全區的支出已篷全國總支出之百分之六十之多。以區區之刧餘殘地何以需要如此驚人的支出呢？為什麼東北一戰區的費用竟超過全國其他戰區的總和呢？東北駐軍之多自然是一個理由。東北號稱有八十萬大軍。以區區三個據點如何容納得了這八十萬大軍已經是一個疑問。而旣擁有八十萬大軍何以不僅不能作面的開展甚至連據點之間及和關內的陸路聯絡都無法打通是一個更大的疑問。放下這兩個疑問不提。卽使我們承認東北確有八十萬大軍也不能作為這樣龐大的開支的充分解釋。</p>
<p>另一個理由卽東北物價之高，瀋陽區的物價經常高出平津一帶十倍。長春是久困敵中的危城，物價自然更不堪言。但是東北最初流行的是流通券，東北物價與關內物價比較還得看流通券與法幣之兌換率而定。流通券購買力之下降旣然更快於法幣，政府卽應將流通率對法幣之兌換率隨之降低。猶之台幣對法幣之兌換率可以因台幣價值比較穩定而逐漸提高同一理由。政府何必一定要堅持一對十甚至一對十一點五的兌換率實在不可解。以流通券及法幣之購買力平價計算，流通券與法幣之兌換率只為一比一。冤仇次幣制改革居然因襲舊法將流通劵與法幣的折合率仍規定為一比十，卽三十萬流通券兌換一金圓，實為這次幣制改革的最大錯誤，同時亦構成新幣制的致命打擊。這種不合理的兌換率造成目前關內外物價的懸殊，同時也是使東北軍政費支出弄成如此龐大的主要原因。</p>
<p>此外，東北財政的地方自主亦是支出過濫的一大原因。蓋東北自接收以來政府卽以特殊區域待之。一切軍政支出只需行贛批准，卽可向中央銀行支借。因此造成軍事當局可以隨時開條子向中天銀行索款之作風。及至疆土日蹙物價猛漲之時，軍事當局對款項之需求竟超過中央銀行送鈔票之能力。但軍需孔急自然是不可須臾稍緩的，於是又產生軍事當局勒令當地中央銀行日夜加班簽發本票以代鈔票的辦法。東北市面上流通的流通券及這批本票空間有多少我們局外人自然無法獲知，但是如果按三十萬流通券等於一金賀的兌換率計算，則必然要佔金圓發行限額的一大部份是沒有疑義的。</p>
<p>在以往流通券不能在關內通用的時候，東北的通貨膨脹的狂　還可以用限制兌換限制匯款的辦法來阻擋，今後關內外一律便用金圓劵加以金圓携帶之便利與關內物價差別之誘引，東北游資的內湧是無法　攔的了。這問題如不迅速解決，則東北游資的洪流不出兩三個月卽可使新幣制崩壞，全國物價　新恢復其　漲的舊態。</p>
<p>要挽救這危機，政府必須毅然決然的採取果斷措施。根據前面的討論，解決這問題的原則是很明顯的：</p>
<p>（一）東北之流通劵與金圓劵之折合率應迅速改為流通劵三百萬折合金圓一圓，卽與法幣等値，俾消滅關內外物價之懸殊·在此新兌換率公佈之前東北流通劵及國家行局在東北發行之本票應卽刻暫停以金圓劵收兌。</p>
<p>（二）以後在東北發行之金圓劵應加蓋限東北通用字樣只準在東北流通。東北至關內之匯款應嚴格限制並酌加高額匯永·</p>
<p>（三）東北軍事當局所需之物資，應儘可能由一全國性之供應機構（如軍事方面之聯勤總部之類）在關內物價較低廉之處採購輸運前往供用，俾使以東北不正常之物價作根據而編製之預算可以减削至最少限度。其必需在當地支付之軍政費用亦應盡量避免以發行新鈔及太票等方法為挹注。政府宜急速運送東北缺乏而價格特昂之物資至東北當地市價拋售而以拋售所得撥付當地軍政當局充其經費。</p>
<p>（四）東北之軍政費用以後宜稍加審核，檢査是否　實及有無空額之現象，一切支出應按照預算撥發，嚴格執行公庫制度。</p>
<p>以上諸項，如第一項能做到則問題已解決一半，則第二項可以不採用，以免為政客及奸匪所利用以分化東北民心。但倘第一項竟不被採用，則第二項將成為絕對需要。</p>
<p>總之目前的東北通貨問題如不迅速解決則關內種種維持物價的措施必然總歸失敗。是否能得解決還待政府的果斷與魄力了。（北京大學）</p>

<p>神道政治已被打倒</p>
<p>談到政治，日本本來自命為神國，天皇賦有神性。目從明治維新後，日本接受了西方的科學，也接受了議會政治，但這一點神道思想沒有變更，因此日本的憲政，就止能說是日本型的憲政，在其他國家都找不出同樣的模型。天皇旣然賦有神性，神道又與政治合為一體，在這種狂妄的信仰和精神之下，日本人民受軍國主義的麻醉，好戰而不怕死；日本的軍閥更與財閥政客相互勾結，使日本國家的經濟力量，儘量集中於國防軍備，而日本軍人在憲法中特殊的地位，又足以使日本內閣的壽命與國策的方向，完全操在軍部的手中；加以日本警察制度的嚴密，使日本人民的自由，完全剝奪，安於最少的工資，和最刻苦的工作，對於軍閥的驅策，財閥的剝削，和政客的愚弄，想也不敢想，說也不敢說。日本五十年來的强盛凶橫，就是建築在這種心理和物質的基礎之上的。到了盟軍佔領了日本之後，日本的立國精神業已有了改革：在日本新憲法上，日皇只有處理國家十項事務的職權，這十項事務，都是禮節和法律程序上的事務，一切政務都不在他的職權之內，日皇業已變成國家的象徵，不再賦有神性，現在日本人民對於天皇制度和裕仁遜位問題，可以隨使討論，這是戰前從來沒有的事情。盟軍總部對於日本的神迫，雖然還准人民供奉，但已經不准政府利用，政治與宗敎是完全分離了，政府對於神社的補助費也完全停止，神職氏子和信徒，也漸漸减少了。在政治路綫方面，麥克阿瑟將軍的辦法，是防制兩極端勢力的抬頭，讓一中道政治」得以順利發展；在政治組織方面，盟軍總部更扶植地方分權制度，一反向來中央集權的規模，並給予日本人民以高度的自由，使他獲得民主的享受，認識民主的精神。這些措施，可以說是很正確的。盟軍總部對於日本侵略主義的人員，曾經嚴格整　，自佔領之日起到最近為止，軍國生義團體的幹部被整肅者在一萬人以上，戰時警察首長及特務警察人員被整肅者六千二百餘名，敎育行政人員及敎職員被整肅者五千六百餘名，公職人負被整肅者在二十萬人以上，職業軍官，全部放逐，但在日本國內仍然不可諱言，還是有些歷史餘毒存在。這些餘毒是蘊藏在日太人民的思想信仰，社會風俗習慣，以及文藝　劇之中，這些殘留的歷史餘毒，有妨礙於日太和平民主的建立，自不待言。由此也可見建立民主的制度比較容易，而養成民主心理與民主生活，還是困難。我曾經為此喚起盟軍總部的注意，警吿日本的領　　袖，並一再公開提醒日本的人民，必須實行思想革命與心理建設，意思就在為日本的和平民主建立一個精神的基礎；但無論如何，日本的神道政治旣已被打倒，天皇旣已否認了神性，自不易再行恢復。日本人民旣已嘗到了自由的滋味，也不易使其輕於放棄，日本式的神權法西斯的政治，是不容易再抬頭的了。</p>
<p>三四年內不能自給</p>
<p>其次談到日本的經濟問題。這可分為兩方面來說明：第一是日本的經濟現狀：在投降的初期頗為混亂，生產停頓，民生必需品缺乏，物價暴漲，黑市猖獗，人民的存款被凍結，配給物品數量很少，一般日本人的生活確是困苦。三年以來，由於盟軍總部的管制，美國的援助，以及日人自身的努力，已經逐漸好轉，日本經濟安定本部並且將從本年十月起，對於一般人民增加主食及日用品的配給。可是日本的經濟　狀，離開自給自足還是很遠，更說不上經濟復興。遠東委員會雖規定日本人民可以恢復他一九三〇到一九三四年的生活水準，但是盟軍總部年來對於日本工業，用盡力量，目前也止能達到那個時期的基數百分之五十五。日本的生產與消費之間，差額很大，現在美國對日本的援助，就在塡補這個差額，每年拿出三億到四億美元，每日大約是一百萬美元，幾乎全是糧食和日用品的補給，日本經濟復興的建設工作還談不到。美國為了想减輕美國納稅人的負担，盡力鼓勵日本增產，但據一般的判斷，日本由於工資太高，商船損失太大，運費過昂，儲藏的原料業已用完，國外的原料不易補給，至少三四年內絕對不能達到自給的程度。</p>
<p>第二要談到日本的經濟改革：在這一點上，盟軍總部對於解散財閥和農地改革，都在着着進行。關於解散財閥，盟總在進駐日本之初，卽下令日本政府廢除束縛自由競爭的法令，制定防止獨佔的法規，並下令解散渦去助長日本對外侵略的財閥會社，整肅經濟界特權人物。關於農地改革，日本現行的農地調整法，預計由國家收買地主的土地五分之四，分給佃農，去年一年中，已收買的土地，佔預計總數百分之七十。我們知道，一個國家只有對內民主，對外纔能和平，也只有經濟民主，政治民主纔有確實的基礎。要改造侵略的日本為和平的日本，必使他的政治民主化，而要使日本政治民主化，又必使他的經濟民主化。我捫中國對於盟軍總部在這一方面的措施，應該特別重視，並期待其積極進行，達成日本經濟民主和平化的目的。</p>
<p>復興關鍵操在中國</p>
<p>說到這裏，我想提出一點，請大家特別注意。日本人民在戰爭慘敗之後，經濟貧困之中，無不渴望經濟復興，日本為求經濟復興，曾擬定了一個五年計劃，規定實施時期原定是一九四八年到一九五二年，現因計劃還有修改，進行也有延誤，須改從明年起實施，一九五三年完成。原計劃以一九五三年的人口估計八千九百萬為根據，擬定各種供應和需要的數字，據日方的估計，這個計劃的實施，因為日本外匯短絀，必須倚靠外援，日方計算所需要的外援款額，共達十六億多美元，每年還需要週轉金兩億到三億美元，用來輸入糧食和棉花，羊毛，煤，鐵，木材等等原料。很據我國經濟專家的估計，日本五年計劃中所輸入的物資，百分之四十來自亞洲，百分之五十來自美元區域。査戰前我國包括東北與台灣在內，對日貿易，佔日本全部對外貿易百分之二十五以上，此次日本所擬經濟復興計劃，就輸入方面看，我國的煤，鏡，鹽，糖，大豆，棉花，飼料等等，都是日本所必需，就輸出方面看，日本的原料，取自美元區域的很多，但日本所製成的商品，如棉紗，機器，化學工業品和毛織品的出口，不能希望在美元區域中有多大的銷售量，不得不靠亞洲為主要市塲，尤其是中國市塲。就上面所說的情形來分析我們對於日本軍國主義能否復活的問題，實在不必一味的恐懼猜疑，日本軍國主義能不能復活，主要是看他國防力量能不能重建，日本國防力量是不是能够重建，主要還要看他經濟條件是不是能够具備。我們試看一看日本的經濟復興計劃，主要原料大部要取自中國，他的工業成品又要中國購買，日本經濟復興的關鍵，操在中國的手中，中國如不與日本合作，日本的經濟復興計劃便沒有順利實現的可能。姑無論日本神道業己衰微，日本天皇的神性業已消滅，日本大多數人民業已在戰爭經驗中覺悟到好戰精神的無效，日本人民業已在佔領時期嘗到了自由的滋味，中央權力業已分散削弱，全能政治無從再度抬頭，卽使搬開這些心理和制度的因素不講，日本在經濟條件上也不能重行建立一個足以威脅和平的軍國，而關鍵正是操在我們中國的手裏，我們應該拋棄消極的無益的猜疑恐懼，枇評指摘，我們應該對日本採取積極的態度，建立積極的對日政策。（下轉第三版）</p>

<p>〔法國新聞社巴黎廿八日電〕英美法三國已共同擬就一文，請求安理會審査柏林問題，該文將於今日下午提呈聯合國秘書長賴依，該文之根據為聯合國憲章第七條「緊急問題之處理」法。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社廿七日電〕安理會大約將於星期四或星期五開會討論柏林事件。觀察家預料屆時對於討論之原則將有一番至激烈之辯論。蘇聯將根據憲章第一〇七條，力主聯合國無權過問關於德國之各問題。西方三强則以為所提交安理會之問題，非德國整個事件，乃一柏林封鎖特殊問題。若干觀察家預料蘇聯將對安理會行一種抵制，如兩年前討論伊朗事件然。同時外交方面指出，今可預決蘇聯對安理會討論柏林事件，仍將使用其否決權，果爾，則次一合法步驟為將該問題提交聯大會，此為無需由五大國一致贊同者。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社巴黎廿七日電〕聞蘇聯外畏莫洛托夫將於數日內到達巴黎出席安理會會議，參加柏林事件之辯論，但此訊尙未經官方證實。衆信美國務卿馬歇爾·英外相貝文·法外長許曼·均將代表本國親自出席。又聞安理會開始研究柏林事件時，英國或將以該會主席職（現為賈德幹）躟予與該問題不直接有關之國。按十月份則輪及美代表任主席。</p>
<p>〔合衆社巴黎廿八日電〕蘇聯及彼蘭代表均表示，蘇聯不致退出聯合國，而擬留下與西方作戰到底。在今日聯大會中，貝文及維辛斯基雙雙缺席。蘇代表馬立克暫代維氏，有人詢以蘇聯是否擬退出聯合國，馬氏答稱，「多承下吿，本人尙係初次聞此事。」</p>

<p>許曼繼之指責蘇聯之封鎖柏林，為一種「武力之行為」，渠痛斥蘇柳無「最小限度之善意」，以解決四强共管柏林及德國等問題。許曼倣金氏口吻稱，聯合國已吿失敗，目前正站於十字街頭。渠指失敗之因素，在於世界分裂成兩個思想集團，及蘇聯「過於濫用否決權」。許曼響應美國務鄉之保證，卽決「不容吾人喪失權利，及離棄吾人有責照護之人民。」許曼稱：「吾人現居於廣泛經濟單位及政治協定之時代中，故歐洲應聯合起來，以圖生存。」許曼並提出法國衷心所欲之計劃—歐洲聯邦。渠稱：歐洲應「聯合求生存」，並籲請各政府迅速行動。故重心又再度寄於發展地區組織，以輔弼遭蘇聯破壞而失敗在望之聯合國。</p>

<p>我們要認識，今後世界的建設，將以亞洲為中心，我們可以說隨第二次世界大戰之結束，亞洲世紀是開始了。世界最豐富而未開發的資源在亞洲，亞洲有十億人口，生活程度最低的也是亞洲，今後亞洲主要的問題，就是如何自己開發資源，自己製造商品，自己提高亞洲人民的生活程度，這種工作必須要亞洲各個國家民族，集合起來，依據聯合國憲章關於經濟合作的規定的精神，與遠東經濟委員會的工作相配合，構成一個相輔相成，互助互利的亞洲區域經濟集團。在這個亞洲經濟集團中，中國責無旁貸要採取主動，我們如不妄自菲薄，這個區域經濟計劃，應該由中國商量有關各國，擬定方案，這個共同建設的工作，應該由中國一馬當先，以前驅自任。而和平民主的日本，當然不能摒除在這個圈子之外，也只有從整個亞洲的前途着想，才能够賦予和平民主的日本以其所應有的地位。在日本戰敗之前，日本軍國主義者曾經提出「大東亞共榮圈」的口號，他那個共榮圈，乃是以日本為主人，以其他亞洲民族為奴隸的經濟圈，是具有極端的侵略性，與排他性的經濟圈。正因為日本軍國主義的存在，亞洲的經濟便無從平衡發展。現在日本的軍國主義是已經摧毀了，眞正互利互助的亞洲區域經濟集團，才開始有建立的可能。因此我們應該一方面防制日本軍國主義的復活，使他不再為和平的威脅，一方面應該指導日本經濟民主化的進路，使日本的特長，就是日本在五十年來所接受的科學智識和日本勤儉耐勞的國民性，能够在亞洲經濟建設中有充分的貢獻。因此，我們應該在防止日本重整軍備，和配合整個亞洲經濟建設的大原則下，有條件的贊助日本復興。</p>
<p>全盤利益遠大措施</p>
<p>回想在對日戰爭初告結束的時候，我們的總絲率先聲明中國對日本不採民族報復主義，日本人民聽到這個聲明，無不衷心感佩。所謂「不報復」，消極的方面，是表示我民族的度量，積極的方面，更須表現於國家的政策，這就是說，當我們處理日本問題的時候，不僅是消極的不予報復，並且要積極的有所作為，我們必須從亞洲各國家民族全盤利益與中日永久的關係上，採取遠大的措施，我們應該促成對日和會的召開，我們應該在亞洲全盤計劃之下，確定中日兩國乃至中國與其他各國之間的經濟關係。亞洲的經濟是要發展和繁榮的，但經濟的發展必須是平衡的，繁榮必須是全面的，而亞洲民族的生存與安全是要有保障的，但民族的生存必須是自主的，安全必須是集體的，而經濟的發展和繁榮，與民族的生存和安全這兩個問題，是不可分的，我們必須先行確實獲得亞洲民族共同不處匱乏的自由，然後才能確實獲得亞洲民族共同免於恐懼的自由。日本問題終竟是一個亞洲問題，在整個亞洲問題之中，來考慮和處理日本問題，一切歷史上的恩怨和戰後的疑慮，便自然得到正確的解　了。</p>
<p>這是本人對於當前日本問題的一點見解，特此提出來就正於全國同胞，敬祈關心日本問題的人士予以指敎，幷共同研討，實深欣幸。</p>

<h3 id="c54">敵偽房地產首批今出售　通告於三日後分發住戶　邵逆武軍住宅最貴　估價逾六十萬金圓　現住戶多機關及各界首長 <a href="#c54" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e54" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">54</a></h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕本市敵偽房地產首批八十單位，今日巳由中信局正式公吿出售。該批房地產，多屬花園洋房或獨立住宅，係本市敵偽房地產精華所在。全部價値，佔本市敵偽房地產總値百分之二十。據中信局公吿稱：該批房地產各單位現住戶，應於該局房地產處通知到達十日內，照通知所列價格，優先承購，先繳半數，作為保證金，其餘價款，自上項通知之日起，一個月內繳淸。逾期不繳，沒收其保證金。如現住戶十日內不為承購，應作放棄論，卽行公開標售，不再通知。但現住戶仍可參加投標。屆時現住戶如未得標，應於上項通知優先承購期滿之日起，一個月內遷讓，遝者由主管機關强制執行。</p>
<p>査上項房地產，每單位現住戶有超過一戶以上者，如各戶均擬承購，可先由各戶自行協議，推定或蹄一戶承購，如爭持不解決，各戶可於接通知後十日內，會齊赴中信局房地產處抽簽決定一戶承購。原住戶承購之房地產，中信局不負代為出清同一單位中其他各戶之義務。標購之房地產，該局負責於限期內，着各原住戶遷讓。該批房地產，據記者調査現作戶大多為個人名義出面，惟亦有以機關出面者，衆信後者佔住之房地產，處理時困難較多。中信局刻正忙於佔價，係照政院規定，按時價估價，通告可於三日後分發各住戶。</p>
<p>最低價數萬金圓一幢</p>
<p>據悉：該批房地產，以餘慶路八十號及湖南路二六二號兩幢估價最高，價均在六十萬金圓以上。餘慶路八十號原屬邵道式軍之住宅，刻為市黨部佔用。最低估價，亦有數萬金圓一幢者。環顧各現住戶中，不芝國府顯要，如李副副總統，白崇禧，陳儀，吳鐵城，鄒魯等。其中李副總統之住宅，原屬馮王祥所居，最近始撥充李氏滬寓，近日正酒掃修茸中，而李氏此次來滬，始終未曾一臨參觀。據此次偕同李氏來滬之總統府秘書黃雪邨語記者，該宅撥作李氏滬寓之事，李氏始終未曾治晤，故刻亦無從作承購之準備。又該批房地產原住戶，亦有挽眷屬出面者，如前本市民調會主委現任浙實物配給委會主委任顯羣所居本市東體育會路一一五號住宅，戶名卽係其妻章筠倩。此外知名之士尙有趙志垚，賀耀祖，方東，唐縱，査良鑑，陳質平，李孤帆，鄧葆光，龔天武，朱慶曾，韓德勤等。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕股票商林樂（二）及杜維屏，陶李國蘭，徐楊淑瑤等拋股違反交易所法一案，昨經地院宣判，其主文為：　『陶李國蘭在交易所以外照交易所之市價，專計贏虧，空盤買賣，處有期徒刑十月。</p>
<p>杜維屏共同連續非在其所屬交易所內買進賣出，而向委託者為同樣之計算方法，處有期徒刑八月。</p>
<p>林樂耕共同非在其所屬交易所內買進賣出，而向委託者為同樣之計算方法，處有期徒刑八月。</p>
<p>徐楊淑瑤在交易所以外照交易所之市價，專計贏虧，空盤買資，處有期徒刑七月。』</p>
<p>昨晨八時許，各被吿卽由馬斯南路第一看守所提到，家屬等百餘人，咸帶沉重心情，到庭旁聽。十時正，沈天保庭長及梅爾和，方祥海兩推事，及蒞庭檢察官丁同峻，陞座刑八庭宣判，首向各被吿宣佈理由，繼朗誦判決主文，並稱判決書於兩日內送達，如不服判決，可於十日內提狀上訴。各被吿聆判，均廢然無所表示，陶李國蘭旋現苦笑，徐楊淑瑤，則立卽熱淚橫流，泣不成聲，當卽退庭還押。玆誌本案判快書所列判決理由如下：</p>
<p>査經紀人對於受託者之買賣，非在其所屬交易內買進賣出或交割者，不得向委託者為同樣或類似之計算方法，經紀人違背此規定時，依第五十三條處罰。又在交易所以外，照交易所之市價，專計贏虧，空盤買賣者，處一年以下之徒刑或三千元以下之罰金，為交易所法第三十八條第五十三條所明定。本件各被吿，</p>
<p>對於事實，在警局中杜維屏承認八月十六日拋售永紗一千六百萬股與林樂耕，八月十九日拋售永紗一千二百萬股與董阿二等，均為塲外交易無賬査稽。林樂耕承認向杜維屏購得永紗一千六百萬股，係塲外交易。陶李國蘭·徐楊淑瑤承認於八月十九日各拋售永紗二百萬股。在本院審判中，除陶李國蘭·徐楊淑瑤供辭，與警局相同外，杜繼屏述稱鴻興證券號事務，由在逃邱雲峯負責，華美工業貿易公司事務，由孫樹人負資。八月十一日後，正値患病，號中事務，無法前往照管，所有塲外交易，均係邱雲峯所為，渠本人並無責任可言。華美工業貿易公司，當日僅代陶李國蘭等打電話至鴻與證券號，通知買賣股票，並非代做股票等語。林樂耕改稱永紗一千六百萬股，係私人向鴻興證劵號購入後，因價目不合，取消前議，未行成交等語。茲本院査杜維屛在證劵大樓，普益大樓分設鴻興證劵號，華美工業貿易公司，均在經營證券，華美工業貿易公司內，</p>
<p>裝有黑板　（上封本年八月二十一日報紙），擴普器，對講電話，壁上記有股票交割字樣，經警員王思祖到案述明，陶李國蘭等當日除開立戶名，買賣股票收取法幣外，復見有七八人，亦同時在買賣股票，茍非平日經營股票業務，則客戶多人，何由上門至鴻興號出售股票，僅永紗一種達二千八百萬股之鉅，規模匪小，茍未得號主許可，店友安有如許財力，從事大量塲外交易。同時店主平日又何致絕未覺察，撲諸情理，彌覺不經。與邱雲峯共同在警局受訊時，該被吿又承認事先曾關照邱雲峯拋空，額子不可大，一千二百萬股，係塲外交易無賬（杜邱二人警局筆錄中，凡未註明林答邱答者，係一人回答，經他人同意，此點，經警員棋成輸說明），一千六百萬股，亦經林樂耕述明，並未取得成交單，是該永紗二千八百萬股，純為塲外交易。鴻興蹬券號與華美工業貿易公司，均馬該被吿所授意經營，</p>
<p>無可諱言　事後翻異，希圖脫卸，不足採信。至林樂耕之購入永紗一千六百萬股，警局中承認雙方舉行交割，彼此淸訖。按林樂耕係一九零號經紀人之重要職員彼此間之買賣，卽為經紀人間之買賣，旣未經過交易所，卽為塲外交易，審判中飾稱為自己買賣，及未行成交，卽行取消，固不可信，而無經紀人身份之人與有經紀人身份之人，共問實施犯罪，當仍以共犯論，均各構成交易所法中非在其所慶交易所內買進賣出，而向委託者為同樣之計算方法罪責。杜維屏基於概括犯意，反覆而為同一之行為，當認為連續犯，以一罪論。至陶李國蘭·徐楊淑瑤八月十九日上午九時，出售永紗股票，每人二百萬股，十一時每人再購入二百萬股，除相抵外，各嬴利法幣二十四億元，審判中分別</p>
<p>自承不諱　査該被吿等事先並未享有該項股票，乃在交易所以外，先行拋售，事後補行購入，純以市價之升降，為一種賭博式之空盤買賣，當構成交易所法中之在交易所以外，照交易所之市價，專計贏虧，空盤買賣罪責亦無可疑。</p>
<p>査國家設置證券交易所目的，原在控制證券市塲，平衡證劵價格，不致兎起鵲落，紊亂金融，使握有游資者，獲有正當出路，貪圖暴利者，無所施其技，工商業籍以振興，市塲籍以穩定，原屬</p>
<p>意良法美　乃被吿杜維屏，林樂耕仍在塲外，舉行證券交易，陶李國蘭，徐楊淑瑤實施空盤買賣，與國家設置證劵交易所及提倡證券交易之目的，適相背馳，惟利是圖，罔顧國策，自非依法科刑，不足以資散惕，爰斟酌情形，於法定本刑範圍內，分屬陶李國蘭有期徒刑十月，杜維屏·林樂耕有期徒刑八月，徐楊淑瑤有期徒刑七月，藉示懲處，而收廓淸投機之效。</p>
<p>上論結，合依刑事訴訟法第二百九十一條前段，交易所法第三十八條第一項第三項善五十三條，刑法第十一條第三十一條第一項第二十八條第五十六條前段，判決如主文。</p>

<p>— 本報記者　劉孟痴</p>
<p>〔本報貴陽廿四日航訊〕貴陽　是一個僅有三十萬人口的城市，但它究竟是西南省份的省會之一，抗戰八年，戡亂三年，它在這比較安定的後方，逐日趨向繁榮，巳漸增至可觀的程度。此次經濟改革方案是全國性，全面性的，我們若果只看滬津穗漢，不看這些邊陬小邑，殊不足以得窺經改方案實施成效的全約，記者謹就「經改彌月」在賣陽的種種表現，詳為報導如次：</p>
<p>中央銀行貴陽分行較全國各大城市還緩一天發行金圓，據該行消息，八月二十三日那天，裝運金圓劵的汽車未能如預定計劃由都勻趕到貴陽，中途在馬塲坪拋錨、深夜始行抵筑，因之第二天（廿四）才開始發行，辦理收兌金銀外幣及法幣掉換事宜。最初上面僅指定，由中央，中國，交通，三家國行負責收換，該行鑒於一切銀行已經停業四日，等候收換的勢必擁擠，乃臨時增加農民，郵匯，合作金庫，及貴陽省銀行等行局庫共同辦理，頭二三天的收換擁擠，勢屬當然，尤以銀元為最，黃金次之，外幣再次之，因為「八·一九」那天，貴陽的銀元價格，頭銀不過法幣三百萬，雜板不過二百六七十萬，黃金每兩法幣三億二三千萬，持有人除非是傻瓜，誰也願送到國家行局去掉換。</p>
<p>貴陽的十七八家商業銀行，這時最感頭痛，因為「八一九」那天所開出的本票或存戶支票，依法一律要付現金圓，到中央銀行去辦交換，純粹以各家行莊所存頭寸為準，無絲毫通融餘地。而此時存戶又</p>
<p>紛紛提現，內外交逼，因之，一般商業行莊在頭二三天無不把營業時間遲開早關門，經理出納四出磕頭作揖，企圖支撑維持。其中有「聚康銀行」，竟在忙亂中又把「只憑轉賬不能付現」的本票，拿來開出金圓，落在一個很懂法令的人手中，後來費了很大力氣才得以彌縫妥當。</p>
<p>央行統計八月廿四，廿五，廿六，廿八日四天（卽收兌第一週）收兌結果，計黃金二，二六八·七三二兩，銀幣四六，一六一元，美鈔二，四二九元，港幣六〇〇元。這數目大部份都是銀元小阪，公敎人員，或尙知守法的高級官吏的宅眷之類送去凑成的。自然經營金銀買賣的大銀樓老闆們也曾以其極小部份去抹過國家行局的面子，惟其數實在微乎其微，而央行方而對於收兌條金，飾金，在成色辨別的人員與技術方面，兩都不够理想，也是足為持有大量金銀者裏足不前的藉口，尤其是最初兩週，央行方面並未開始收兌銀塊銀錠，在他們誠有不得已的苦衷，（因為缺少識別銀塊銀錠的專門技術人員與工具）可是對於持有人前往兌換及限期收兌歸為國有的法令執行就大有妨碍了，而貴州省又自來是行使銀類講求藏銀的省份之一，這問題直到九月十三日起，央行開始收兌白銀，才算獲得解決。</p>
<p>黃金商人在貴陽，在江西幫，陝西幫，川幫，三十多家銀樓業，資金都相當大，他們不只僅做金銀買賣，也做港紙，美鈔，百貨，布疋，凡可以賺錢的生意，都不惜多立牌號，無所不做，「八，一九」的貴陽金價每兩三億二三千萬，改幣令下之後，每兩變為六億，他們還認為謙得不多，於是憑空暗中散布流言，時而說上海黑市已到八億，時而說重慶黑市已到九億，他們的門市，只是收進，決不賣出，謠言不脛而走，不但有少許金飾的人決不去央行兌換，甚至沒有金飾的人也寗願出七億八億走暗門路，出高價錢去買幾錢金飾來保藏着。黃金如此，銀元亦然，外幣在貴陽，除港紙有行市消息外，美鈔實鮮人談及。因此之故，央行第二週的收兌統計，黃金方面不及第一週（實際只有四天）收兌數目的四分之一，僅只五〇四·三七〇兩而已，第三週也不過免强超過第二週的三分之一，為數僅一五二·六九六兩而已，而較第一週的四天收兌數目，則更屬懸殊。幸經省會警察局，筑市政府請示省當局，決以行動促進銀樓業迅將所有金銀持往國家行局兌換金圓，籍以貫澈法令，乃於九月十二日晨六時分為八個工作小組，同時以閃電式檢査各個較大銀樓，結果在李文興，老寳慶，老寳成，三家金號及其老閣住宅內査獲金飾二一七兩，金條六根，銀條九二二斤，銀元一五二枚，外有各項寳石三十只，老寳慶並藏有白布十一捆，陰丹士林四包，據稱為寄存之布疋九十三件，並獲有高價出售金飾可疑字據。當將此一向操縱貴陽金市之</p>
<p>金老虎袁德泉，李滿堂，李海生，甘煥霖，呂學海等捕獲，並轉解省保安司令部訊辦。果如所料，經改方案得此政治力量支持之後，央行方面第四週之黃金收兌數目卽行直綫上昇，由第三週之一五二·六九六兩，直昇為四四四·四〇六兩，他如銀元，白銀，美鈔，港紙，均較第三週增加十倍，六倍不等。貴陽金虎被擒之後，金融市塲乃得漸趨平靜。</p>
<p>惟小春秋晚報以不愼於剪，於九月十四日轉載重慶九月八日大公晚報「五角銀元暫不通用」消息後，市民誤以為「五角鎳幣暫不通用」，不半日間，人心慌亂，市面拒絕行使，幾引起大風波，幸當局措施妥洽，立卽傳詢該報負責人，予該報停刊一月處分，一面由央行發佈正式消息，切實更正，市面乃復正常。近則又以銅幣半分，二分，未經央行總行正式公吿通用，而流傳民間者為數不少，尙時起糾紛，此問題雖無關宏旨，但仍究屬未獲解決之問題。</p>
<p>筑市現所流通之金圓劵，仍以十元，五元者為最多，一元者已不多見，輔幣劵一角二角，運到者本不多，幸鎳幣在抗戰期中留存此間央行者為數極夥，市面找補尙無若何問題，惟黔省各縣則甚感苦痛，民問交易尤為不便，近由央行決定，今後所到一元金圓券與一二角輔幣劵盡量</p>
<p>運往各縣流通，或可稍獲解決。惜普設各縣之郵匯局無論對省內省外之內匯率，迄今仍高過其他國家銀行所定之匯率，此對於縣鄉金融流通方面尙未能盡其應有之配合，殊為美中不足。</p>
<p>幣制改革之後，首先成為問題的是物價。貴陽的物價，除舶來品外，一向比上海為低，原因一是這裏幾乎是純農業經濟社會，人民生活異當儉樸，一是當時筑滬間的匯水反常，在貴陽交兌法幣七百五十萬元，卽可在上海取得一千萬，卽是說商人只憑做匯兌，每千萬元就凈賺了二百五十萬，故貴陽的物價較低，何况筑滬間金銀價格又相差很大，而市面的物價又向係以金銀食米為標準。幣制改革之後，法令規定，全國各地的物價均須凍結在當地的「八·一九」那天的數字上，可是貴陽市的金銀價格「八·一九」那天與上海的幾乎相差一倍有餘，現在要用法令來使之向上海看齊，母怪從事商業的，工業生產的，或是純消費的人，都對物價一致看漲。因之在改幣令下以後，市府限價未核定以前，那十天之內，整個貴陽市幾成為有市無交，亂喊價錢，盡力燴購狀態，反映出人民的心理巳達於不安己極。</p>
<p>省市當局這時獲得極可靠的情報，有「隱名人士」從廣州匯來一百多萬金圓到貴陽</p>
<p>搶購物資僅只農民銀行一家便是六七十萬金圓之多，商家觀望全國各地物價，堅不放出已逾兩週，當局對於凍結「八·一九」物價的法令，看看已覺不能貫澈，恐怕物資南逃廣州之後，貴陽市塲無法維持，遂加多方研討，結果定為「凡省外輸入物品，一律以批來地點之價，加上運筑運費，加上合法利潤為楔準」，反之，「凡本省所出物品，一律以產地批發之價，加上遝筑運費，加上合法利潤為標準」，來作為限價依規。本此原則，於是日用百貨，平均均照「八·一九」物價提高百分之四十至五十，本省所出物品，平均提高百分之七十至八十，甚有超過一倍以上者，如食米一項，「八·一九」那天，每斗法幣一千三百萬元，遂提高為二千七百萬元，折合金圖九角，這實是谷正倫主席為保護本省農產品，提高農民生活不得已的苦衷。雖然如此，商家仍然不把物資放出，直到今日，不是物資逃匿，便是次貨敷衍，甚至肉荒，米荒，一天嚴重一天，日前竟發生貧民因無法買到食米而跳河自殺的現象。</p>
<p>滇成此種現象，實由商家不認識經改方案之本質所致，比如連日正在開會的市參議會，竟公然只知商人利益，以連日米荒嚴重為題目，用其「悲天憫人」的口吻，似有企圖首先取銷食米限價，來作為推翻一切限價的張本。他們於九月二十日第一次會議決，「食米暫不限價」，並且立卽要市長張致詳陪同他們去省政府，一定要達到</p>
<p>暫不限價的目的，雖經省府（谷正倫出巡黔西大定）秘書長潘錫元，　　　　始得出一　　　持限價，上白米聽任自然」的玄妙結論。該會並於昨（廿二）日第三次會決議：「盼市府對糧價一改過去刻板之管制，對價格略具伸縮餘地』，並「勿令警察再事干預」。在此「民主」高唱入雲之時代，市府只好接受執行，故自廿二日起，米商均已笑逐顏開，食米亦紛紛問世，所做之價，上白米　　一元五角，中米相差一元，所謂下米或糙米則根本無有，而政府所限定之九角一斗云云者，巳成吿朔　羊，惟米荒問題獲得解決，亦屬幸事。</p>
<p>食米問題解決後，市民目光，現又移於肉荒菜荒現象，希望能隨之解除，並有若干市參議員認為米與豬肉供應，有若千連帶關係，且均出自鄉間，勢應同吿解除，　消限價。市府方面表示仍當嚴于限制，決不再向彼等「抵頤」。淮一般有識人士所深為焦慮者，貴州係屬農業經濟社會，各物價格及勞務價格，歷來習慣多以米價為準，現在食米限價取消，聽任自由交易，則一切物價工價均有取消可能，此對經改方案之實施成效，將增不小困難，希望有關方面迅謀補救。</p>

<p>〔本報開封廿六日航訊〕國立河南大學雖不是國內的名大學而在文化落後的河南，却是最高學府，抗戰前以校舍與圖書儀器見稱，光復後以伙食打架見稱，一年上不了幾天課，今年六月又趕上了逃難，開封淪落之後，部令該校在蘇州復課，於是員生陸續由烽火中的開封跑到山明水秀的蘇州，從此虎邱山上，獅子林中，滄浪亭畔，西園寺裏，到處都可以看到河大男女學生的踪影，因為沒有地方住宿上課，學生們心裏納悶，南京，上海，杭州，無錫也滿處是白廂的河大學生。敎部一再嚴令該校早日復課，雖然校力負責人表示九月十五日開學，繼又表示十月十五日開學，最後又表示十一月間開學，可是敎部田次長却洩氣的說：「這樣子，十二月怕也不能上課」！河南人眼看着自己的子弟在失學，河南老百姓的血汗錢買來的圖書儀器搬到江南，心裏實在覺得可惜，一月以前就以開封已漸平定，呼籲河大遷回開封，省參會主張最力，他們大聲疾呼的說：「中央如覺得蘇州有增設大學的必要，敎部可撥款另辦一國立蘇州大學，河南的圖書儀器不能搬到江南去」！最使一般人覺得可惜的，是空留在開封的那所富麗堂皇的河大校舍。最近河大當局派員來汴押運岡書儀器南去，（按此批物品係前擬南運，後被河南人扣留車站者）開封車站以係奉部令撥車，不得不撥，乃一面掛車，一面函省參會知照，省參會接函後，卽函省府阻止，省府乃派省警局前往扣留，省警局一督察長帶警察廿名馳赴車站交涉，至則火車已陞火待發，廿個警察卽排隊立於車頭前面阻止開車，一面並請車站立卽將河大物品卸下，河大押運人員出而爭執，為時甚久，車上旅客急欲開車，問明原因後乃有五六百人自動下車將河大列車六節卸下，並高呌：「河南東西為什麼要運到江南去？誰不讓卸車卽打陂誰的腦袋！」車卸之後，經檢査內除圖書儀器藥品外，尙有大包棉花一部，聞前次被和，卸車時尙發見運有瓜子花生米者，一般人對此益表不滿，現此問題，仍在僵持，將來如何解決，頗難預測。</p>

<p>— 本報特約記者　司馬炳</p>
<p>〔本報西寗廿四日航訊〕育海自入夏以來，全省相繼發生亢旱·冰雹·黑霜·風沙等災害，農村經濟，已瀕絕境，不料上月下旬間，各地繼之以狂風暴雨？山洪暴發，被災的地區，遍及各地，造成近有年來所僅見的大天災。</p>
<p>水災發生前夕</p>
<p>低氣壓自上月廿一日左右猛襲靑境，最先受害的是湟源，貴德，接着是湟中等縣，迨廿五，廿六日，災書已普及全省。西寗市水災發生之前夕，在夜間九時許，黑雲密佈天空，繼以驟雨，傾盆潑下，同時狂風肆虐，雷電交加，農作物登時摧殘迨盡，直徑一二尺的大樹，被在風連根拔起，作蜻蜓倒立，稍小的樹木悉被腰嘶，吹至一二里以外。移時屋圯牆坍，慘呼震天，令人耳不忍聞！次日大雨稍住，各地山洪併發，有關國防建設及民生福利的公路橋涵及水渠電廠等，無不蒙受巨災，尤其是國道。省道及大車道，十分之九皆被冲毀。今年剛剛動工的大型水利「常勝」，「慶凱」，「平安」，「閣公」等重要工程，悉被摧毀。</p>
<p>農民泣於田野</p>
<p>譽滿全國的靑海人造林，在這次大雨中被豆浪漂沒的大小樹木，連二百餘萬株之鉅，農田的被水冲，砂壓，泥淤，民問荳梱，麥堆以及人畜的冲失，淹斃，均慘不忍睹。先此，各地迭降黑霜，使所有正待收穫的農作物，全數凍枯，殺秕，據報省的有湟源，同仁等七縣卅餘鄉鎭，受災面積僅澧源一縣，便有四·四六〇·二畝，以致秋收無望。其他各地久旱不雨，農作物間被病，虫害侵製，據呈報到省的便有湟中，大通，貴德等十四鄉，而只湟中一縣，受災的面積卽連四一·七三六·六八畝，受災成分均在八成以上。農民老幼，號泣田間。</p>
<p>一篇損失總賬</p>
<p>直接為此次大雨所造成的災害，據省府初步調査統計的結果，關於山洪冲毀的道路橋樑涵洞等，計橋樑一一四座，涵洞十三座，路面路基九十五處，渡船筏六隻，渡口皮袋十隻。山洪冲淹的農田地畝有西寗，樂都等五縣二十餘鄉鎭，被淹農田達五千二百餘畝，幾乎是全部被泥沙淤沒。公私建築物傾圯的約二百餘處。電信設備為當時雷電震擊損失的，計三十門，二十門總機各一部，座機五部，掛機二部，電桿六七〇根，電綫約三百二十餘斤。西寗水力發電廠在這次大雨裏，造成三千九百五十金圓的損失，若非搶修得宜，將陷全市於恐怖的黑暗裏。關於「芳惠」等二十餘大小渠道的損失，實在難以估計，僅今年正在興建的「長勝」，「慶凱」等四個渠道，已耗資金圓劵八十萬圓以上。</p>
<p>補修工程發軔</p>
<p>省府為急謀災害的恢復，災民的救濟及全省經濟的復蘇，曾召集本市各機關法團首長，各縣市長，民意代表，在省立委監委及地方紳耆，各中小學校長等，舉行緊急會議三天，咸認搶修這路恢復交通為首要之岡，決定了「新路不開，舊路不斷」的原則，訂定縝密的計劃與步驟，徵用全省的民工，物料，工具，運輸力等，（卽民工之食糧，燃料，炊具，帳幕等，也要自備）積極搶修。此項補修工程，已於本月二十一日開始，政府並派定各縣市長為督導人員。據馬主席步芳表示：「只要全省人民本着我們窮幹，實幹，快幹，硬幹的精神，積極從事各項工程的進行，一定能獲得完滿結果的！」在我們的想像中，靑海人民過去在當局卓越的領導下，能在短期內完成國防要道之靑藏，靑新等公路，造成中國公路修建的奇蹟，現在這些修補工程，應該是易如反黨的事。</p>
<p>恢復重要措施</p>
<p>不過，週身的血脈雖然暢通了，但局部的病症還不宜使其蔓延及惡化。至於本省其他各項工程的重建，水渠的修復，人造林的補植，災民的賑濟，田賦的鐲免，牲畜的補充，都是有關國防及農村經濟的重要措施，必須亟謀恢復。只是靑海人口稀少，財政困難，省府雖曾電請中央撥發急賑款五百萬金圓，以之解救燃眉則可，以之圖謀恢復，實有未逮。西北的秋天是短暫的，酷寒而漫長的冬天就要來了，我們面對着數十萬瑟縮在秋風裏的災民，體會着新，藏夾峙下的靑海局勢，為民生，為國防，需要當局和全國人民，伸出同情與援助的手來！</p>

<p>米市堅定，各檔價格少有變動，但到貨益見减少，良以產地價高，以致阪戶裏足，昨日南北二市共計到貨祗九百六十七石，市上供應亦因之更少。粳米高貨有行無市，中次貨略有做開，秈米供應亦已减少，僅碾秈略有成交，其他概祇　皇交易耳。</p>
<p>麵粉</p>

<p>據輸管會息：本週（九日廿日至廿五日）我外銷品國外行市，尙稱堅穩，其主要項目，且呈秀色。惜國內產地價格較高，益以產地至口岸交通困難，在在助長收購之困難。茲將各項主要出口品之個別情况，分誌如後：</p>
<p>桐油　產地報價平穩，但到貨仍少，國外行市已因實施出口限價政策，價格略揚。據中國銀行九月廿三日紐約電訊，該地桐汕每磅已達美金二角一分。</p>
<p>猪鬃　市况盛衰迭見，國內價格頗受業外人士收購之影響，國外行市吐秀，據中國銀行廿三日紐約電訊，各項猪鬃，每磅美金價格，計天津長鬃發價十一元，還價十元，短（二）發價六·五五元，還價六·四五元，廿六箱發價五·三〇元，還價五·〇〇元，電慶鬃發價二·七七元，還價二·七〇元，有斑點貨發價二·三〇元，還價二·二五元，出口商之有存貨者，均可成交易。</p>
<p>茶葉　市塲穩銷，產區價昂，到貨轉稀，輸出商買氣雖盛，但以喊價巍站高峯，洋莊僵持，做開陜隘，國外行市則平靜。上等祁紅上海FOB每磅美金二角五分，屯綠仍站三角，照目前國外市價折算，出口有虧損，國外需要尙股。</p>
<p>生絲　國內外市價略相平衡，D級上海FOB每磅仍站美金二元八角，鮮腸衣產量轉旺，出口數量尙不惡，照目前行市計算，出口尙可成交。水泥出口最大困難，端在包裝材料之缺乏，現該會經已呈准政院，准自國外輸入紙袋一百五十萬隻，用供國內諸大水泥廠需要，今後水泥輸出，可望展開云。</p>

<p>— 靖文</p>
<p>根據地大物博，文化悠久一類的說法，在科學技術方而，我們確實也有許多可以誇口的地方，如發明了羅和　針，造紙，火藥等等。而且我們的上代，對於工藝技術確亦十分注車。像「工欲善其事，必先利其器」的說法，已槪括地說明了我們的遠風卽已深切知道了工藝技術的哲學。他如專門記載工藝技術的書籍，如「考工記」，「天工開物」等，更證明了古代人民對於工藝技術的重視</p>
<p>然而環顧我們這一代，在工藝按術這一門上，顯然落後得太可怕了。住在上海這樣大工業都市中的人，也許還不能十分覺察出這種現象，因爲凡是世界工業的進步產物，如飛機，輪船，汽車，火車，各種機器及其製品，在都市裏面都是應有盡有。對於出門坐飛機，上寫字間坐汽車的人們，更極少能領悟到我們在世界工藝技術上所處的可怕的落後地位。而這輩人却偏就是我們的「國家棟楔，社會柱　，你說可怕不可怕？</p>
<p>這倒並不是設近年來我國絕無科學與技術的人才，人才有的是。如最近在國內各地舉行學術演講的錢三强博士，其對原子理論的學術貢獻，已獲得世界聲譽。其他專門高級技術，也是人才輩出。不過問題是在工藝技術的普遍與平衡發展方面。一國國民經濟的强盛與否，爲一國强弱的關鍵所在，早爲不移之論，而國民經濟的强盛與否，其必須取決於一國的經濟生產能力，亦早成定論。然而決定一國生產能力的，則斷不能依賴少數的天才或少數的專家。天才固然是異數，專家也是國寶，然而多數人的技術智識與生產能力，才是一國眞正經濟强盛的決定點。</p>
<p>然而我們的缺點現在却正就在這方面。卽就擁有五百萬人口的工業都市上海而言，眞正的產業工人恐怕也爲數不多，而能自動悉心致力於工藝改進的，更是少數中的少數。若說我們至今還是一側農業國，但現在却反要局部靠工業國的「救濟米」爲生，豈非大可悲哉。雖然說來話長，而農業技術千百年來始終沒有改進，則終是不能否認的事實。</p>
<p>這個問題談起來是太大了，牽涉太廣了。惟個人有一個感觸，卽認爲民族氣質的沉淪，對於工藝技術的不能上進大有關係。舉例說：我們在科學的發明發見上近數百年來雖無甚進步，惟獨對於偸巧取乖一類手段，如冒牌，偸工减料的模製，影射等，却頗玩得高明。例如有人僞製瑞士某藥廠的某種針藥，雖然是偽製品，在上海還化驗不出，直待送至瑞士本廠，始能斷定是贋品，則足見雖然是僞造，也相當精明，如果肯將僞製所耗的精力用於發明發見的研究上，想必能有眞正的收穫。現在捨此正途而不由，實不能不說是民族氣質沉淪的結果。</p>
<p>此外，我們近數百年來的文化路綫太偏重於精神的抽象方而，也是對工藝技術發展的一大阻碍。科舉時代的空頭文化雖已成過去，然而淸末民初提倡的聲光化電堅甲利器，至今也還不過是紙上談兵。過去有人譏我們爲「文字之國」，現在豈非仍舊如此？拿「德先生」與「賽先生」的問題來說，報章雜誌最熱鬧的，至今還是「德先生」的問題。也許有人相信唯有在「德先生」的問題解決之後，我們才可以談到「賽先生」，然鄙人對此見解，總覺得有疑問。要是沒有「賽先生」的實力帮助，恐「德先生」者，永遠祇好紙上熱鬧吧。</p>
<p>自抗戰迄今，增加生產的呼聲聞之久矣。然而不先增加人民的生產技能，不喚醒人民對於工芤技術的進取心，這類呼聲必將愈來愈空洞了。可是在少數人翻手覆雲之間卽可立成暴富的今日，鼓勵人心的上進是否還有可能，這誠是一大疑問。如此看來，「德先生」的問題確比「賽先生」要重要了。不過相信祗有這兩位先生携手共進之日，才是問題的眞正解決之日。現在關於「德先生」的事至少大家都有了一個槪念，這誠是可喜現象；所希望者，大衆對於「賽先生」不要太冷落了，因爲將來的最後主人，非此君莫　也。</p>

<p>— 毛毅</p>
<p>每一個夏夜約有八十二萬五千個美國人坐在他們的汽車中看電影。這種觀衆坐在自己的汽車中看戲的露天電影院，美國人名之曰Drivin姑譯作「汽車戲院」）。這種戲院在起初不過是些塞足百把輛汽車的陋地，播音機喧譁擾人，而如今却整頓得足以容納七百輛到一千輛汽車，有特築的汽車斜道，正直　銀幕，兩個別控制的車內談話機械。</p>
<p>新式的「汽車戲院」有遊藝塲，彈球塲，和野餐的桌子。在肯特基州柯文頓附近的一個「汽車戲院」，除了放映電影之外，還免費供給觀衆下列享受：看燄火，騎馬，划船。</p>
<p>十二歲以下的兒童可以免票，所以，在許多「汽車戲院」中可以看到；除了駕車的是一個大人外，整車都擠滿了小孩子。但是，戲院老闆倒也不在乎。他們要使人們知道光顧「汽車戲院」的好處。觀衆在這裏可以吸烟交談，或者吃炒米花，而不會打攪四週的人。這裏沒有停車問題，也不需要在大熱天打扮得整整齊齊。不便到室內戲院去的胖子和殘廢的人，羣趨「汽車戲院」。</p>
<p>「汽車戲院」已有十五年的歷史，不過發展以去年最爲蓬勃。首創人是紐傑西州坎登地方的一個名呌李卻。郝林斯海達的年靑的化學品製造商。他在一九三三年五月組織了一個公司，在他的表兄弟財力的支持之下，在他的故鄉附近建立了世界第一所「汽車戲院」，面積倒也能容納五百輛汽車。設備在今日看來雖然簡陋，但在當時却是　舒服的看電影的方法。</p>
<p>其他的工程師紛起效　，在美國參戰時已有五十二家「汽車戲院」，另有六十二家在興建或籌劃。當時影片商雖然祗供給它們一些　片子，但是，經營者每年總共還可賺到三百萬元。</p>
<p>戰時的汽油配給差不多扼死了「汽車戲院」，但到了一九四六年中，它們又活躍起來了。現在全美有五百四十六家「汽車戲院」，差不多可容納二十七萬五千輛汽車。它們每年所獲的凈利據估計約有二千八百萬元。依現在的興建率看來，到一九五〇年，美國將有一千家以上的「汽車戲院」。</p>
<p>「汽車戲院」對觀衆的服務愈來愈週到。有一家免費代熱嬰兒的奶瓶。有幾家殷有狗房，免費爲帶狗的觀衆服務。還有一家最爲週到，主婦到粥裏去看電影可以將家裏要洗的東西留在一個特別的棚子裏。等她看完電影出來時，戲院已將那些東西洗好烘乾，原件奉上——不過，這項服務却是要另外收費的。</p>

<p>— 翼雲</p>
<p>余旣記某校學生捕賊事於廿六日本談矣，茲記該生等又一趣事。某日，一同學結婚，俗有「窺房」之舉，（卽於夜深時，潛往新房窺聽，得知新夫婦一切言動，次晨宣之大衆，以爲笑樂，並藉索糖果。）諸生固少年好事，自極樂爲，是夕暗中摸索，脫履潛往，以免為新人所聞。顧行近新房窗前，覺步步皆有細砂，觸於襪底，作喞喞聲，以手拂去，着地又有。窺聽久之，但見新郎盤旋室中，嗣復轉入床後，良久始出，然爲床幔所掩，不知何作。俄而新郎卽脫衣登床，新婦則早斜倚沙發，各自酣臥矣。候至將明，毫無所得，更復飢蚊嘬膚，無法再待，乃相率以歸。詎下樓至梯將盎處，一足忽踐水中，深且沒脛，方知爲人所算。蓋早有人置盆永於此，先行者旣入冰，亦不作聲，恐後者覺悟，轉爲所笑也。次行者亦踐水，仍不言，最後者竟雙足躍下，全入水中矣。奔歸臥室，不料門早內鍵，無法得入，乃共坐庭中，夜凉砭膚，加以襪褲均濕，冷極欲顫，蚊又嘬人，不勝其憊。黎明互視，忽覺而均烏黑，斑駁如鬼，狀極可笑，始知窗前細砂，乃新郎暗布煤層，又曾以手拂拭襪底，並擊蚊於面，復又搔之，以致如是。而梯底水盆亦新郎所置，蓋其床後有門，潛出爲之，諸生爲幔所掩，不得窺其妙用也。此新郎亦狡極矣。</p>

<p>— 錢大成</p>
<p>自從諸葛武侯「誡子書」中提出了「非澹泊無以明志」，「非寗靜無以致遠」兩句話，就有好多人認「澹泊」是人類修養的最高境界。嚴幾道更說，武侯這兩句話的意思，是得諸老子。越發顯得澹泊是不可多得。陶淵明所說的「素心人」，其實也就是澹泊無爲的人。</p>
<p>「澹泊」誠然是難得，能視富貴如浮雲，一生得從其所好，眞是所謂淸福。但同時卻有人在大聲疾呼的說：「人生可不富貴乎？」明知「富貴猶如草頭露」，不過人生旣如同草木，如沒有少許甘露的滋潤，勢且枯萎憔悴以死。在兵荒馬亂的年頭，要求得最低限度的享受，其難甚於太平盛世的高官厚祿。所以龔定實要說：「中年才子躭絲竹，儉歲高人厭薛蘿，兩種情懷俱可諒，陽秋貶筆未宜多」了，</p>
<p>在亂世高談「澹泊」，其實是忍不住生活的壓迫，喊出的一陣　以解嘲嘲的高調。「澹泊」而不能「寗靜」，那也何嘗能够「明志」「致遠」？眞正能澹泊的人，嘴裏決不喊出「澹泊一兩個字來。——我感覺到還是范伯子來得痛快，他說：「早知澹泊生煩惱，何苦當時不忍狂」。你儘管能荼苦自甘，但怎受得住「室人交徧謫我」的苦痛？所以有人在說：「濟官可爲而不可爲，貪官不可爲而可爲」了。</p>
<p>我並非瞧不起「澹泊」，只盛到　其空喊「澹泊」，還不如咬緊了牙齒忍受來得痛快。</p>
<h3 id="c120">黃金與國運 <a href="#c120" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e120" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">120</a></h3>
<p>— 祝枕江</p>
<p>據報載今日中國金圓券發行準備金中黃金爲二十七億六千七百一十萬三千五百八十七盎司，（編者按：此數係根據金圓劵發行後中央社報道，各報紀載皆同，然事實上殆必有錯誤，卽以金圓劵發行額祇二十億而論，事實上亦無需如許金準備也。）白銀爲四千一百三十七萬盎司。此爲國庫所有之金銀數，而民間蘊藏量之多寡，正如鼎之輕重，未可問焉。惟見史册所載中國黃金數兩古多今少，古賤今貴。此可於斤兩上覘之。昔蘇秦說趙，趙王賜黃金萬鎰。漢書注云：秦以一鎰爲一斤，漢以一斤爲一金。陳平說漢，淡王予以黃金四萬斤，且恣平所爲，不問出入。或謂十萬斤，見竹軒摭錄。梁孝王死，藏府餘黃金四十餘萬斤。王莽死，發見省中黃金萬斤一櫃者六十櫃。董卓死，在　塢中有黃金三萬斤。此外賞賜用黃金者例亦不少。武帝賜東方朔金百斤。又賞從衛靑出塞有功之戰士至二十餘萬斤。宣帝前後賜霍光至七千斤。魏孝文帝賜抱睹生葬中黃金八千斤。</p>
<p>至於六朝，銀仍用斤，而金乃用兩。隋文帝賜周法尙黃金一百五十兩，銀百五十斤。是爲斤兩並稱之僅見者。　除　考謂計兩之例，始於梁。漢景圍城，羊侃率兵禦之，詔送金五千兩，銀一萬兩，以賜將士。此後槪稱爲兩。陳周羅　以彭城拔圍功，得賞金銀各三千兩。隋梁　以平劍南功，得賞則金三千兩。來護兒以破楊元惑，得賞則黃金千兩。由此可知南北朝時巳稱金銀爲兩矣。</p>
<p>宋代國弱民貧，黃金數字大見减少。宋史杜鎬傳，太宗問西漢賜予悉用黃金，何以近代爲難得之物？鎬曰：當時佛事未興，故黃金賤。其實徽欽二宗乞和於金，尙饙黃金二十萬兩，白銀二百萬兩。但以兩與斤較，已不知短少幾何倍矣。現以之爲乞和之用，自不能與賜予可比。蓋一者出於自然授與，手有餘資，他者不得已而爲之，不能不强事取求也。</p>
<p>明代中央昏　，宦寺專權，私括金銀，容藏極富。識小錄載正德中籍沒劉瑛金一千二百五十萬七千八百兩，銀二萬五千九百五十八萬三千六百兩。七脩類　亦云明正德間前有中官劉瑾，後有指揮周寗，皆擅主權。及籍家資，劉瑾計有金二十四萬錠又五萬七千八百兩，元寶五百萬錠等。而當年國庫藏金，自亦不在少數。</p>
<p>淸代和珅抄家，籍沒之數較之劉瑛者渺乎小矣。蓋不過壁藏黃金二萬六千八百餘兩耳。此正與宋代巨奸嚴嵩私藏之數相埒。天水冰山錄戲嚴嵩之敗，籍其家，僅黃金三萬兩，白銀三百餘萬兩。或調彼寄存於內府外府之數，較之劉瑾朱琮（識小錄朱琮籍銀五千萬兩）者更甚。畢竟權奸智謀，高出宦寺多多矣。</p>
<p>總上所見，由黃金之動態與數字，卽可以明國力之强弱。而於授受藏放之間，亦大可以窺國運之消長也。</p>

<p>[Qiazhong News Agency, Washington, 27th] A US official said on the 27th: China is launching a movement to explore how other Eastern countries react to the concept of an Eastern alliance similar to the Western European alliance and the Pan-American alliance. They said: The clue to this matter was found in the conversation between Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Shijie and Indian Prime Minister Nehru on his way to Paris, and in the position taken by Wang at the United Nations General Assembly. Foreign Minister Wang pointed out at the UN General Assembly that he believed that Eastern countries were under-represented in the Economic and Social Council. They further said: Although there are obstacles to the organization of the Eastern Alliance, China will continue to work in this direction. They also said that the concept of the Eastern Alliance can be said to have inherited Sun Yat-sen's plan, as well as Japan's "Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere" and "Asia for Asians". This plan was difficult to implement before the war, but the climax of nationalism in various parts of the East has formed a belief that the plan may be close to realization.</p>

<h3 id="e13">Legislative Yuan Secretly Passes a Resolution Urging Prompt Demarcation of the Sino-Burmese Border; Schedules a Talk on the Current Situation <a href="#e13" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c13" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">13</a></h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch on the 28th] The 6th meeting of the 2nd session of the Legislative Yuan was held at 9:30 AM on the 28th. Because it involved two cases concerning foreign affairs and the budget, it was first conducted in secret. 371 members attended. President Sun presided over the meeting. Minister of Interior Peng Zhaoxian, Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Acting Minister Liu Shishun, and Director of Internal Territorial Affairs Fu Jiaojin attended. First, the report items were processed, and then the discussion items began. The first secret case was the proposal by Tao Rong and other members of the Foreign Affairs Committee to examine and approve the proposal to promptly demarcate the undetermined border between China and Myanmar in order to enhance Sino-Burmese friendship. Minister Peng and Vice Minister Liu explained the matter. Peng described in detail the history, evolution, and geographical situation of the border issue between China and Myanmar. Only one section of the southern section of the border, from Jian Gao Mountain to the Sino-Vietnamese border, remains to be surveyed and established. The area that still needs negotiation and demarcation is the area from Jian Gao Mountain to the Kangying border. The area of the disputed land is equivalent to Zhejiang Province. Britain has been working hard in this area in recent years, so the demarcation work is very urgent. Liu gave a brief report on the history of the demarcation negotiations between China and Britain and China and Myanmar, and the government's attitude towards the matter, and stated that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs had made full preparations for this demarcation negotiation work, and would implement it as soon as there was a suitable opportunity. The two explained for an hour. Members Ma Chongliu, Xiao Cen, Guo Dequan, Lu Zongqian, Xie Jianhua and others successively raised questions, and unanimously believed that the existence of the undetermined border between China and Myanmar affected the normal development of friendly relations between the two countries. Finally, it was voted on and passed without objection to send this case to the government for execution as soon as possible. The second secret case was the report of the Budget Committee and the Finance and Finance Committee and the Economic and Resources Committee on the preliminary estimate of the operating budget of the state-owned enterprises for the second half of the 37th year. Yin Shuxian, convener of the Budget Committee, explained the examination process and pointed out the three main points of the examination report: (1) This preliminary estimate case was not compiled in detail in accordance with the operating budget compilation and examination method. The necessary data for each item was incomplete and could not be examined. Because the monetary unit of the issue of gold yuan coupons has changed, it should be returned to the Executive Yuan for re-compilation and then sent for review. (2) Matters that should be noted when re-compiling this preliminary estimate and key points for reform in the business of each institution, such as the rationalization of employee compensation and the need for profits to be turned over to the national treasury, etc. (3) Many state-owned enterprises should be reduced and reorganized. The examination meeting made specific suggestions on this, such as the need to abolish the Four Joint Offices. After Yin's explanation, Wu Ji, Zou Shuwen, Lei Yin and others spoke successively. Finally, the examination report was passed without objection, and it was replied to the Executive Yuan to act accordingly. Then, the temporary motion of Qiu Hanping and other members was discussed. The deadline for the government to redeem gold, silver and foreign currencies is September 30. According to reports from the people in Xiamen, Quanzhou and other areas of Fujian overseas remittance area, various redemption banks refused to redeem due to limited manpower, so that the overseas Chinese dependents in the above-mentioned areas will not be able to redeem before the deadline. Therefore, it is recommended that: anyone who fails to redeem gold, silver, and foreign currencies before the deadline can report the quantity and type of gold, silver, and foreign currencies in writing to the Central Bank or its designated bank before the deadline. The bank should continue to redeem them after the deadline and shall not refuse. After Committee Member Qiu explained the proposal, Secretary-General Zhang Jiyuan stood up to report that he had received a call from Secretary-General Li Weiguo of the Executive Yuan that the deadline for the exchange of foreign currency by overseas Chinese was set for the end of the year. Since the government already has other regulations, the committee asked the original proposer and agreed to change this case to an inquiry case and send it to the Executive Yuan for a reply before the 30th. The meeting adjourned at 12:00.</p>
<p>The regular meeting continued at 3:30 PM, still presided over by President Sun, to discuss the unfinished agenda of the fourth meeting. Xiao Zheng and others proposed to draft a bill on agricultural land reform. In addition, Pan Lianfang and others proposed to implement the case of agricultural land to farmers, urban land to urban residents, and rich resources to the state. Since it was of the same nature as the Xiao Zheng case, it was also discussed together. The committee members vigorously debated for more than two hours. After resting at 5:30 PM, Vice President Chen chaired the meeting, and the debate was still fierce. Finally, it was decided to continue the discussion at the next regular meeting. Then, after amending and passing the temporary motion of Hu Qiuyuan to schedule a talk on the current situation, the meeting adjourned at 6:30 PM.</p>
<h3 id="e14">I am working hard to balance the budget; Wang Yunwu tells US economic leaders <a href="#e14" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c14" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">14</a></h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 27th] Minister of Finance Wang Yunwu said on the 27th: He has confirmed to the leaders of the US economic community that China has embarked on the road of self-help and is trying to balance the budget. All the leaders are deeply convinced of this. According to Wang, he has met with many American and international financial leaders in Washington in recent days. Wang said: These leaders are very concerned about China's currency reform and other economic measures, and most of them agree with China's bold measures this time. The government has recovered such a large amount of gold, silver, and foreign exchange just over a month after China changed its currency. They are deeply impressed and surprised. Wang also said: By the end of September, the amount of financial foreign exchange exchanged by the Chinese people to the government is expected to reach 150 million US dollars, and another 50 million US dollars may be reached. In addition to the above two items, the foreign exchange turned over to the Central Bank by various national banks is another 110 million US dollars. Minister of Finance Wang also said: His visit here is very short, so he has no plans to request loans from the World Bank or the US government. After the meeting, he plans to return to China from the west coast of the United States and is scheduled to return to Nanjing around October 10. However, he said: If there is an opportunity, he will not hesitate to contact all parties and prepare for future loans. He also said that because he has a very short time in the US, he does not intend to discuss the use of aid funds from the Economic Cooperation Administration with Director Hoffman of the Administration in the US.</p>

<p>[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 28th] Former Premier Zhang Qun, at 8 PM on the 28th, broadcast "Impressions of Japan" on the Central Broadcasting Station. The original text is as follows:</p>
<p>Fellow countrymen, this trip to Japan to inspect has been of concern to compatriots at home and has also drawn significant attention from people abroad. My actions and statements in Japan received sympathy and encouragement on the one hand, and on the other hand, they also aroused speculation and criticism. Since returning to the country, I have been receiving visits from friends from all walks of life and have been unable to respond to them individually. Today, I have specially organized the materials obtained from the visit to Japan, and from the perspective of the future of Asia and the efforts that China should make, I would like to offer my opinions and give a comprehensive report to the people of the whole country. I hope this report can provide the people of the country with some understanding of the Japanese issue, as well as a reference for the government's decision-making on the Japanese issue.</p>
<p>Since the Meiji Restoration in Japan, for more than eighty years, on the one hand, the militarist ideology was formed by mixing the Shintoism and Bushido inherited from history, and on the other hand, modern scientific knowledge was absorbed as the basis for industry and military preparedness. These two tools were used by the group of Japanese warlords, plutocrats, and politicians. They used the excuse of "limited land, large population, and insufficient production" to stimulate the people internally and to justify expanding aggression externally. China and Japan are geographically close, so China bore the brunt. In the more than fifty years since the Sino-Japanese War of 1894-1895, China has always been under the iron heel of Japanese aggression. After the success of the Northern Expedition of the National Revolution in the seventeenth year, the power of the Chinese National Revolution and the power of Japanese imperialism changed from side conflicts to direct confrontation. From September 18th to July 7th, this conflict reached an irreversible point. Our compatriots throughout the country resolutely rose up to resist the war. During the eight years, China's loss of life and property was devastating and incalculable. However, in this war, militaristic Japan collapsed, China's century-old accumulation of international shackles was lifted, and the majority of Asian nations also gained independence and freedom. This is the result of this war, and it is also the contribution of China's eight years of hard fighting and sacrifice to Asia and the world.</p>
<p>After Japan surrendered, the Allied forces occupied Japan. The agency responsible for discussing policies for the control of Japan was the Far Eastern Commission in Washington. The Allied Headquarters, commanded by General MacArthur, was responsible for the actual implementation of the control policies in Japan. In the past, Japan was ruled by warlords, plutocrats, and politicians, who wantonly carried out aggression, and China suffered the most. Now, what kind of country will Japan become under the control of the Allied forces? China is naturally particularly concerned. Unfortunately, three years have passed since the end of the war. Due to the complexity of the world situation and the differences in the opinions of the Allied nations, the peace conference with Japan, like the peace conference with Germany, has not yet been able to be convened. News between China and Japan is isolated. It is difficult to obtain a clear and accurate impression from China's side about the situation in Japan. Chinese people inevitably have concerns and doubts from extreme concern, and therefore feel uneasy. Is it possible for Japanese militarism to revive by taking advantage of changes in the international situation? Can Japanese democracy be truly established? Will it revert to the old path of totalitarian politics in the future? If the Japanese economy recovers, will it enable Japan to rearm or hinder China's economic construction? Is the Allied Headquarters' policy of controlling Japan too lenient? Are there any mistakes? There are many questions, and the anti-American and pro-Japanese movement has arisen in various places, taking advantage of this suspicious concern and uneasy psychology. Before the War of Resistance Against Japanese Aggression, I had not been to Japan for many years. The year before last, I passed through Japan on my way back to China from the United States for medical treatment. I only stayed for three days and did not have time to observe. I personally cannot provide a confident answer to the above questions, nor have I received a satisfactory answer. In order to understand the true situation in Japan after the war, and also with the encouragement of colleagues from the East Asia Association, I made this trip to Japan for inspection.</p>
<p>I arrived in Japan on August 21st and returned to China on September 13th. I spent three weeks inspecting in Japan, met with General MacArthur four times, and listened to reports from leaders of various political parties and important figures from all walks of life in Japan. Combining these meetings and reports with the information provided by various aspects of the Chinese delegation stationed in Japan at the Allied Headquarters and what I saw and heard in person, I would like to briefly report on the situation in post-war Japan below:</p>
<p>Disarmament Carried Out Thoroughly</p>
<p>In terms of military equipment, when the Allied forces occupied Japan, there were still 2.7 million soldiers within Japanese territory, who were disarmed within a short period of time. More than 7 million overseas Chinese and prisoners of war were also gradually returned to their hometowns within a considerable period of time and resettled. All military institutions of the army, navy, and air force were abolished, and warships, aircraft, fortresses, and other armed equipment were confiscated or destroyed. As for the military ports, airports, police, and maritime security agency, etc., which are generally concerned, from the actual situation I know: Japan's military port, Tokuyama Port, has already been abandoned after the war. The British Navy is currently using the Kure Naval Port. The Yokosuka and Sasebo naval ports are the main bases for the U.S. Navy in Japan. The Maizuru and Ominato naval ports are secondary bases for the U.S. Navy. The fortress facilities of the above ports have all been dismantled.</p>
<p>There were originally more than 200 airfields on the Japanese mainland. After the Allied forces occupied Japan, 33 were retained for use by the British and American air forces. A small number of them have been expanded to meet the needs, and the rest have been converted into farmland, salt fields, or other non-military uses.</p>
<p>Speaking of the police issue: Originally, all Japanese police belonged to the state and were uniformly commanded by the central authority. Now, there are 125,000 security police in Japan, with one handgun allocated for every five people. Only 30,000 of them belong to the central government. The autonomous police belonging to the local governments are 95,000, all of whom are voluntary professional police with no term of service. There are 30,000 clerks and secretaries, etc. Those who have served as military officers are not allowed to transfer to become police officers. In addition, there are about 9,000 railway police under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Transportation, about 5,000 economic police under the jurisdiction of the Economic Inspection Agency, and 2,000 labor supervisors under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Labor. In total, there are about 170,000 people.</p>
<p>As for maritime security, there are currently 29 main security boats with a speed of ten nautical miles and a tonnage of about 100 tons, without armaments. In addition, there are 15 tugboats ranging from 50 tons to 200 tons, and 60 small boats of 20 tons. There are also two 2,000-ton supply ships borrowed by the Allied Headquarters. The duties of these ships are to rescue ships in distress, prevent smuggling, and matters related to the restoration of lighthouses, salvage of sunken ships, and so on.</p>
<p>From the above-mentioned situations, the Allied Headquarters' work to disarm Japan in the past three years can be said to have been carried out thoroughly. The number of police, security boats, and firearms used by Japan now is considered by the Allied Headquarters to be the minimum requirement for Japan to maintain the current domestic maritime and land order and is by no means sufficient as a basis for the reconstruction of the Japanese sea and land forces. Furthermore, in terms of the fundamental conditions for national defense and military equipment, Japan has lost more than 43% of its original territory after its defeat, and has lost a lot of coal and iron resources. Materials necessary for modern warfare, such as oil and rubber, are also non-existent. Japan used decades of effort to expand its territory, seize resources, and accumulate a set of national defense forces, which were still not enough to win the Second World War, and the result was a complete defeat. Today, weapons are more advanced, and the form of warfare has changed. It is truly a very slim thing for Japan to rebuild a set of national defense forces with its existing resources and technology to cope with the next war. (Continued on page 2).</p>

<p>Investigating Responsibility for the Fall of Jinan</p>

<h3 id="e19">Special Article: Northeastern Idle Capital Urgently Needs to Be Resolved <a href="#e19" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c19" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">19</a></h3>
<p>— Shi Shi</p>
<p>It has been a month since the implementation of the new currency system. Although the government used overwhelming force to limit prices to the level of August 19th, prices in various places still inevitably show signs of underground activity. Sometimes, even if the superficial prices do not change, the quality and ingredients are being reduced. Sometimes, commodities are almost impossible to buy on the open market (i.e., at the government-limited price), forming a state of having a price but no goods. If you want to buy goods, you must go through the black market. The reason is nothing more than the sharp increase in issuance, resulting in a rapid expansion of the people's effective demand for goods. Since the currency reform, the speed of issuance has exceeded that of any previous period. This is enough to make anyone hold great hidden worries about the future of the gold yuan.</p>
<p>Part of the source of the issuance is indeed released by the government's redemption of gold and foreign currency, but the main source is probably the government's military and political expenditures. At a time of raging internal strife, the vastness of military expenditures is naturally expected, but whether the various expenditures are actually reported and whether they have been economized as much as possible remains to be investigated, and the military expenditures in various places, especially in the Northeast, are particularly appalling.</p>
<p>The area controlled by the Northeast has been reduced to only three isolated strongholds: Changchun, Shenyang, and Jinzhou. However, we have heard that the monthly military and political expenditure in Changchun, a small place, is about to reach 700 million gold yuan. The expenditure in the entire Northeast region accounts for more than 60% of the total expenditure of the country. Why does a mere remnant of the war require such an astonishing expenditure? Why does the expenditure of the Northeast war zone exceed the total expenditure of all other war zones in the country? The large number of troops stationed in the Northeast is naturally one reason. The Northeast is said to have 800,000 troops. How can these 800,000 troops be accommodated in just three strongholds? This is already a question. And since there are 800,000 troops, why is it not only impossible to expand the surface but even impossible to open up land communication between the strongholds and with the mainland? This is an even bigger question. Leaving these two questions aside, even if we admit that there are indeed 800,000 troops in the Northeast, it cannot be a sufficient explanation for such a huge expenditure.</p>
<p>Another reason is the high prices in the Northeast. Prices in the Shenyang area are often ten times higher than those in the Pingjin area. Changchun is a dangerous city that has been trapped by the enemy for a long time, and prices are naturally even more unbearable. However, what was initially circulating in the Northeast was the circulation voucher. The comparison between the prices in the Northeast and the prices in the mainland had to be based on the exchange rate between the circulation voucher and the legal tender. Since the purchasing power of the circulation voucher decreased even faster than the legal tender, the government should have reduced the exchange rate of the circulation voucher to the legal tender accordingly. The same reason applies to the fact that the exchange rate between the Taiwan dollar and the legal tender can be gradually increased due to the relatively stable value of the Taiwan dollar. It is incomprehensible why the government must insist on an exchange rate of one to ten or even one to eleven and a half. Calculated according to the purchasing power parity of the circulation voucher and the legal tender, the exchange rate between the circulation voucher and the legal tender is only one to one. The currency reform has actually followed the old method and still stipulated that the conversion rate of the circulation voucher to the legal tender is one to ten, that is, 300,000 circulation vouchers can be exchanged for one gold yuan, which is the biggest mistake of this currency reform, and also constitutes a fatal blow to the new currency system. This unreasonable exchange rate has created a disparity between the prices inside and outside the customs, and it is also the main reason why the military and political expenses in the Northeast have become so huge.</p>
<p>In addition, the local autonomy of the Northeast's finances is also a major reason for the excessive expenditure. Since the Northeast was taken over, the government has treated it as a special area. All military and political expenditures only need to be approved by the local commander before they can be borrowed from the Central Bank. This has created a style in which the military authorities can issue IOUs to the Central Bank at any time. When the territory shrank and prices soared, the military authorities' demand for funds exceeded the Central Bank's ability to send banknotes. However, military needs are naturally urgent and cannot be delayed for a moment. Therefore, the military authorities ordered the local Central Bank to work overtime day and night to issue promissory notes to replace banknotes. Outsiders naturally cannot know how much circulation vouchers and promissory notes are circulating in the Northeast market, but if calculated according to the exchange rate of 300,000 circulation vouchers for one gold yuan, it must account for a large part of the gold yuan issuance limit, which is beyond doubt.</p>
<p>In the past, when circulation vouchers could not be used in the mainland, the frenzy of inflation in the Northeast could be blocked by restricting exchange and restricting remittances. In the future, the use of gold yuan coupons uniformly inside and outside the customs, coupled with the convenience of carrying gold yuan and the inducement of price differences inside the customs, will make it impossible to stop the inward flow of Northeastern idle capital. If this problem is not resolved quickly, the torrent of Northeastern idle capital may collapse the new currency system in two or three months, and the national prices will return to their original state of rising.</p>
<p>To save this crisis, the government must resolutely take decisive measures. Based on the previous discussion, the principles for solving this problem are very clear:</p>
<p>(1) The conversion rate between the circulation voucher and the gold yuan coupon in the Northeast should be quickly changed to 3 million circulation vouchers to one gold yuan, that is, equivalent to the legal tender, so as to eliminate the price difference inside and outside the customs. Before the announcement of this new exchange rate, the circulation voucher in the Northeast and the promissory notes issued by the national banks in the Northeast should be immediately suspended from redemption in gold yuan coupons.</p>
<p>(2) The gold yuan coupons issued in the Northeast in the future should be stamped with the words "Limited to use in the Northeast" and only allowed to circulate in the Northeast. Remittances from the Northeast to the mainland should be strictly restricted and a high remittance fee should be added.</p>
<p>(3) The materials required by the military authorities in the Northeast should be purchased and transported from places where prices are lower in the mainland by a nationwide supply agency (such as the Joint Logistics Headquarters of the military) as much as possible for use, so that the budget based on the abnormal prices in the Northeast can be reduced to the minimum limit. Military and political expenses that must be paid locally should also be avoided as much as possible by issuing new banknotes and promissory notes, etc. The government should quickly transport materials that are lacking and particularly expensive in the Northeast to the local market in the Northeast for sale and allocate the proceeds from the sale to the local military and political authorities to cover their expenses.</p>
<p>(4) The military and political expenses in the Northeast should be slightly reviewed in the future to check whether they are actually reported and whether there are any vacancies. All expenditures should be allocated according to the budget, and the treasury system should be strictly implemented.</p>
<p>If the first item can be achieved, half of the problem will be solved, and the second item may not be adopted, so as not to be used by politicians and bandits to divide the hearts of the people in the Northeast. However, if the first item is not adopted, the second item will become absolutely necessary.</p>
<p>In short, if the current currency problem in the Northeast is not resolved quickly, all measures to maintain prices in the mainland will inevitably fail. Whether it can be resolved depends on the government's decisiveness and courage. (Peking University)</p>
<h3 id="e20">First Batch of U.S. Aid Cotton: Allocation Work Completed. Decision Not to Cancel Food Rationing <a href="#e20" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c20" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">20</a></h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 28th] The Executive Yuan's U.S. Aid Utilization Committee and the U.S. Economic Cooperation Administration's China Branch held their seventh joint symposium at 4 PM on the 28th, with Premier Weng presiding. The following matters were decided: (1) Cotton: (A) The allocation work of the first batch of U.S. aid cotton, 69,528 bales, has been completed. The allocation work was carried out by the Joint Operating Office of Cotton Yarn and Fabrics. Based on the actual needs of various regions across the country, a reasonable allocation was made after multiple careful discussions. The quantity and proportion are as follows: A. China Textile Corporation: 28,318 bales, accounting for 40.732% of the total. B. Zone 6 (Shanghai, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui): 29,894 bales for factories with more than 3,000 spindles, accounting for 42.994% of the total; 1,350 bales for factories with less than 3,000 spindles, accounting for 1.939% of the total. C. Zone 7 (North China, Tianjin and Beijing): 1,557 bales, accounting for 2.259% of the total. D. British Merchants: 659 bales, accounting for 0.955% of the total. E. Zone 9 (Qingdao): 552 bales, accounting for 0.789% of the total. F. Other zones: 7,198 bales, accounting for 10.351% of the total. (B) The yarn exchange ratio for the second batch of aid cotton has been discussed and finalized at the fourth meeting of the Cotton Group. It is 583.5 pounds of 7/8-inch medium-grade U.S. cotton to exchange for a 400-pound bale of 20-count yarn. Compared with 599 pounds in the first phase, it is reduced by 15.5 pounds, of which the processing fee is still 146 pounds, plus a loss of 2.5 pounds. What has been changed is the original cotton part. The original cotton figure for yarn exchange in the first phase was based on the average amount of 453 pounds of raw cotton required for a bale of yarn spun by Chinese yarn mills determined by the Cotton Yarn and Fabric Management Committee. The raw cotton figure for yarn exchange in the second phase is based on the figure of 435 pounds of raw cotton required for spinning a bale of yarn by the U.S. Department of Agriculture. This figure was decided by the Cotton Group meeting, which included representatives from all parties, and then implemented after being approved by the Sino-U.S. Joint Symposium. (2) Industrial construction and supplementary equipment: Regarding the White Engineering Company's technical team hired under the special project for industrial construction and supplementary equipment, an office will be established at 1320 West Beijing Road, Shanghai in early October of this year.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 28th] Regarding the issue of food rationing, the Management Committee has previously advocated that it should be reconsidered to avoid wealthy households enjoying the preferential treatment of rationing. It is learned that the authorities, after careful consideration, have decided that food rationing will not be canceled. At the joint meeting of the U.S. Aid Committee and the U.S. Economic Cooperation Administration's office in China on the 28th, the issue of preparing for the food source for rationing in October was raised for discussion.</p>

<p>[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 28th] The Cotton Textile Industry Association of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, Nanjing, and Shanghai appealed to limit the number of Japanese spindles to no more than 3 million as necessary, and that the excess should be dismantled and transferred to our country as compensation in order to oppose the restoration of the Japanese textile industry. The Ministry of Industry and Commerce's opinion is as follows: Regarding the production level of the Japanese textile industry, the Far Eastern Commission originally listed it as a restricted industry. However, our country has formulated restrictions on production levels for three items that are indeed related to our country, such as cotton textiles and mulberry fields, as follows: (1) 4 million cotton spindles, (2) 150,000 cotton looms, (3) 200,000 cho of mulberry fields. These figures have been separately listed in the "Revised Table of Restricted Industrial Production Levels in Japan" and were approved at the 43rd meeting of the Executive Yuan on February 17 this year as the basis for negotiation. Because the limited figures were determined by our country it does not seem appropriate to modify them.</p>

<p>[United Press Nanjing, 28th] According to Chinese intelligence, the Chinese Communist Party has established a highly efficient worldwide intelligence and propaganda organization. They are using this organization to propagate Soviet ideology and expansion among the various ethnic groups of Asia. The person in charge of this organization is Zhou Enlai, the CCP's second-in-command. In his position as the Overseas Activities Minister of the CCP Intelligence Bureau, he formulates and directs all plans.</p>
<p>The tasks of this organization are threefold: (1) to collect foreign intelligence; (2) to spread communism among the indigenous peoples of southern Asia and incite local rebellions; (3) to alienate overseas Chinese from the National Government.</p>
<p>Zhou Enlai has appointed eight representatives to guide ideological expansion work abroad. These eight people are Hu Ji stationed in New York, Zhao Mi stationed in Hong Kong, Li Lian stationed in Europe, Chen Chengnan stationed in Southeast Asia, Zhou Bing stationed in Japan, Chen Min stationed in Burma, Wu Jingliang stationed in Indochina, and Yang Qi stationed in Siam. The main branches are likely to be in New York and Hong Kong. It is claimed that the New York branch was established in May of this year through the cooperation of CCP leader Hu Ji and another Chinese leftist, Ji Fang. Ji Fang is the liaison representative in the United States for the Chinese Workers' and Peasants' Democratic Party (i.e., the Third Party), and has now also been hired as an advisor to the Hong Kong branch of the CCP's Xinhua News Agency and a special correspondent for the agency in the United States. The main tasks of the New York branch are sixfold: (1) to agitate against American aid to China; (2) to support Wallace's Third Party activities; (3) to collect national production statistics; (4) to investigate the attitude of the people of the United States towards the Chinese civil war; (5) to collect intelligence on Canadian aid to China; (6) to collect all other intelligence in the political, economic, military, and diplomatic fields.</p>
<p>The center for guiding the CCP's overseas organizations in Southeast Asia is in Hong Kong, and Zhao Mi, the person in charge of the Hong Kong branch, maintains direct contact with Zhou Enlai.</p>
<p>However, the most threatening aspect of the CCP's overseas activities to the Chinese government is the Indochina branch headed by Wu Jingliang. Intelligence indicates that Wu Jingliang is organizing armed forces with his Indochinese counterparts, attempting to invade Yunnan and Guangxi.</p>
<p>[New Asia News Agency, Tokyo, 28th] Matsudaira, Director of the Research Bureau of the Japanese Foreign Ministry, reported on the 27th to the Security and Local Government Committee of the House of Councillors on the situation of the Japanese army in the Northeast, stating that the total number of former Japanese soldiers in the CCP army in Manchuria is approximately 60,000, mainly serving as auxiliary forces for the CCP army's operations, with a small number operating mechanized weapons or heavy weapons.</p>

<h3 id="e32">Zhang Qun Broadcasts His Impressions of Japan (Continued from Page 1) <a href="#e32" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c32" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">32</a></h3>
<p>Shinto Politics Have Been Overthrown</p>
<p>Speaking of politics, Japan originally proclaimed itself a divine nation, with the Emperor endowed with divinity. Since the Meiji Restoration, Japan has accepted Western science and parliamentary politics, but this Shinto ideology has not changed. Therefore, Japan's constitutionalism can only be described as Japanese-style constitutionalism, and a similar model cannot be found in other countries. Since the Emperor is endowed with divinity, and Shintoism is integrated with politics, under this arrogant belief and spirit, the Japanese people were intoxicated by militarism, warlike and unafraid of death. Japanese warlords colluded with financial cliques and politicians, concentrating the economic power of the Japanese state as much as possible on national defense and armaments. The special status of Japanese military personnel in the constitution allowed the military to completely control the life of the Japanese cabinet and the direction of national policy. In addition, the strictness of the Japanese police system completely deprived the Japanese people of their freedom, allowing them to be content with the lowest wages and the most arduous work, and they dared not even think or say anything about the driving of the warlords, the exploitation of the financial cliques, and the fooling of the politicians. Japan's strength, ferocity, and tyranny over the past fifty years has been built on this psychological and material foundation. After the Allied forces occupied Japan, the spirit of the Japanese nation has been reformed. In the new Japanese constitution, the Japanese Emperor only has the power to handle ten state affairs, all of which are ceremonial and legal procedures, and all political affairs are outside his jurisdiction. The Japanese Emperor has become a symbol of the state, no longer endowed with divinity. Now, the Japanese people can freely discuss the emperor system and the abdication of Hirohito, which was never the case before the war. Although the Allied Headquarters still allows people to worship Japanese gods, it no longer allows the government to use them, and politics and religion are completely separated. Government subsidies to shrines have also been completely stopped, and the number of Shinto priests, parishioners, and believers is gradually decreasing. In terms of political line, General MacArthur's approach is to prevent the rise of extreme forces and allow a "middle-of-the-road politics" to develop smoothly. In terms of political organization, the Allied Headquarters has supported a decentralized system, reversing the past centralized model, and giving the Japanese people a high degree of freedom, allowing them to enjoy democracy and understand the spirit of democracy. These measures can be said to be very correct. The Allied Headquarters has strictly purged the personnel of Japanese aggression. From the beginning of the occupation to the present, more than 10,000 cadres of militarist groups have been purged, more than 6,200 wartime police chiefs and special police officers have been purged, more than 5,600 educational administrators and teachers have been purged, and more than 200,000 public officials have been purged. All professional military officers have been exiled. However, it is undeniable that some historical poisons still exist in Japan. These poisons are hidden in the thoughts and beliefs, social customs and habits, and arts and dramas of the Japanese people. These residual historical poisons hinder the establishment of peace and democracy in Japan, needless to say. From this, it can also be seen that establishing a democratic system is relatively easy, while developing a democratic psychology and a democratic life is still difficult. I have called this to the attention of the Allied Headquarters, warned the Japanese leaders, and repeatedly reminded the Japanese people to carry out ideological revolution and psychological construction, in order to establish a spiritual foundation for Japan's peace and democracy. But in any case, Japan's Shinto politics have been overthrown, and the Emperor has denied his divinity, so it will not be easy to restore them. The Japanese people have tasted the taste of freedom, and it will not be easy to make them give it up lightly. Japanese-style theocratic fascism is not easy to raise its head again.</p>
<p>Cannot Be Self-Sufficient in Three or Four Years</p>
<p>Secondly, let's talk about Japan's economic problems. This can be divided into two aspects to explain: First, the current economic situation in Japan: It was quite chaotic in the early days of surrender, with production stalled, a lack of necessities, soaring prices, rampant black markets, people's deposits frozen, and the quantity of rationed goods very small. The lives of ordinary Japanese people were indeed difficult. In the past three years, thanks to the control of the Allied Headquarters, American aid, and the efforts of the Japanese themselves, it has gradually improved. The Japanese Economic Stabilization Board will also increase the ration of staple foods and daily necessities for the general public from October of this year. However, Japan's economic situation is still far from self-sufficiency, let alone economic recovery. Although the Far Eastern Commission stipulates that the Japanese people can restore their living standards from 1930 to 1934, the Allied Headquarters has used all its strength for Japanese industry in recent years, and currently can only reach 55 percent of the base number of that period. There is a large gap between Japan's production and consumption. Now, American aid to Japan is filling this gap, taking out 300 to 400 million US dollars each year, about one million US dollars a day, almost all in the form of food and daily necessities. The construction work of Japan's economic recovery cannot be talked about yet. In order to reduce the burden on American taxpayers, the United States is trying its best to encourage Japan to increase production, but according to general judgment, Japan will absolutely not be able to achieve self-sufficiency for at least three or four years due to high wages, large losses of merchant ships, high freight rates, and the fact that stored raw materials have been used up and it is difficult to replenish raw materials from abroad.</p>
<p>Second, let's talk about Japan's economic reforms: On this point, the Allied Headquarters is steadily proceeding with the dissolution of financial cliques and land reform. Regarding the dissolution of financial cliques, the Allied Headquarters ordered the Japanese government to abolish laws restricting free competition, formulate regulations to prevent monopolies, and order the dissolution of financial clique companies that had helped Japan's external aggression in the past, and to purge privileged figures in the economic community. Regarding land reform, the current Japanese Land Adjustment Law plans to have the state purchase four-fifths of the landowners' land and distribute it to tenant farmers. In the past year, the land that has been purchased accounted for 70 percent of the total planned amount. We know that a country can only be peaceful externally if it is democratic internally, and only with economic democracy can political democracy have a solid foundation. To transform an aggressive Japan into a peaceful Japan, its politics must be democratized, and to democratize Japanese politics, its economy must be democratized. We Chinese should pay special attention to the measures taken by the Allied Headquarters in this regard, and expect them to actively proceed and achieve the goal of economic democracy and peace in Japan.</p>
<p>The Key to Recovery Lies in China</p>
<p>Speaking of this, I would like to raise a point that I would like everyone to pay special attention to. After the Japanese people suffered a disastrous defeat in the war and were in economic poverty, they all longed for economic recovery. In order to achieve economic recovery, Japan formulated a five-year plan, which was originally scheduled to be implemented from 1948 to 1952. Now, because the plan is still being revised and the progress has been delayed, it must be implemented from next year and completed in 1953. The original plan was based on an estimated population of 89 million in 1953, and the numbers for various supplies and needs were formulated. According to Japanese estimates, the implementation of this plan requires foreign aid due to Japan's foreign exchange shortage. The Japanese side calculates that the amount of foreign aid needed totals more than 1.6 billion US dollars, and also requires 200 to 300 million US dollars in working capital each year to import food, cotton, wool, coal, iron, wood, and other raw materials. According to the estimates of our country's economic experts, 40 percent of the materials imported in Japan's five-year plan come from Asia, and 50 percent come from the dollar area. According to investigations, before the war, our country, including the Northeast and Taiwan, accounted for more than 25 percent of Japan's total foreign trade. In terms of imports, Japan's planned economic recovery plan requires coal, mirrors, salt, sugar, soybeans, cotton, feed, etc. from our country. In terms of exports, Japan's raw materials are mostly taken from the dollar area, but the export of Japanese-made goods, such as cotton yarn, machinery, chemical industrial products, and woolen products, cannot hope to have much sales in the dollar area, and must rely on Asia as its main market, especially the Chinese market. Analyzing the situation mentioned above, we do not need to be blindly fearful and suspicious about whether Japanese militarism can be revived. Whether Japanese militarism can be revived mainly depends on whether its national defense power can be rebuilt. Whether Japan's national defense power can be rebuilt mainly depends on whether its economic conditions can be met. Let's take a look at Japan's economic recovery plan. The main raw materials must be taken from China, and his industrial products must be purchased by China. The key to Japan's economic recovery lies in China's hands. If China does not cooperate with Japan, Japan's economic recovery plan will not be successfully implemented. Regardless of whether Japanese Shintoism has declined, the divinity of the Japanese Emperor has disappeared, the majority of the Japanese people have realized the ineffectiveness of the warlike spirit in the war experience, the Japanese people have tasted the taste of freedom during the occupation period, the central power has been decentralized and weakened, and omnipotent politics cannot rise again, even if we move away from these psychological and institutional factors, Japan cannot re-establish a militaristic state sufficient to threaten peace in terms of economic conditions, and the key lies in our China's hands. We should abandon negative, useless suspicion, fear, criticism, and accusations. We should adopt a positive attitude towards Japan and establish a positive policy towards Japan.

<h3 id="e33">Three Powers File Lawsuit on Berlin Incident; Security Council Meets Yesterday; Soviet Union Expresses No Intention to Withdraw from the United Nations; Rumor that Molotov May Go to Paris in Person to Participate in Debate <a href="#e33" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c33" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">33</a></h3>
<p>[United Press, Paris, 28th] The United Nations Security Council will convene at 3 p.m. on the 28th (midnight Shanghai time) to hear the Western three powers' accusation against the Soviet Union's blockade of Berlin.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 28th] The United Kingdom, the United States, and France have jointly drafted a document requesting the Security Council to review the Berlin issue. The document will be submitted to UN Secretary-General Lie today afternoon. The document is based on Article 7 of the UN Charter, "Handling of Emergency Issues."</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, 27th] The Security Council is expected to meet on Thursday or Friday to discuss the Berlin incident. Observers expect a fierce debate over the principles of the discussion. The Soviet Union will rely on Article 107 of the Charter, arguing that the United Nations has no right to interfere in issues concerning Germany. The Western powers believe that the issue submitted to the Security Council is not the entire German issue, but a specific issue of the Berlin blockade. Some observers expect the Soviet Union to engage in a kind of boycott of the Security Council, as it did two years ago when discussing the Iranian issue. At the same time, diplomatic sources point out that it can now be predicted that the Soviet Union will still use its veto power in the Security Council's discussion of the Berlin incident. If so, the next legal step is to submit the issue to the General Assembly, which does not require the unanimous consent of the five major powers.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 27th] It is rumored that Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov will arrive in Paris in a few days to attend the Security Council meeting and participate in the debate on the Berlin incident, but this news has not been officially confirmed. It is widely believed that US Secretary of State Marshall, British Foreign Secretary Bevin, and French Foreign Minister Schuman will represent their countries in person. It is also rumored that when the Security Council begins to study the Berlin incident, the United Kingdom may transfer the chairmanship of the council (currently held by Jebb) to a country not directly related to the issue. According to the rotation, the US representative will take over the chairmanship in October.</p>
<p>[United Press, Paris, 28th] Representatives from the Soviet Union and Belarus have stated that the Soviet Union will not withdraw from the United Nations, but intends to stay and fight the West to the end. At today's General Assembly meeting, Bevin and Vyshinsky were both absent. Soviet representative Malik temporarily replaced Vyshinsky. When asked if the Soviet Union intended to withdraw from the United Nations, Malik replied, "Thank you for the information. This is the first time I have heard of this matter."</p>
<p>[United Press, London, 28th] Soviet Ambassador to the United Kingdom Zarubin flew to Paris on the 28th and then returned to Moscow. Before leaving, he told reporters, "This return to the country is only for vacation purposes."</p>

<p>[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 28th] It is expected that the General Assembly plenary meeting will conclude its business tonight, and all subsequent meetings will focus on the work of the committees. The Security Council is scheduled to meet this afternoon to record the Hyderabad withdrawal of the lawsuit against India, review Bulgaria's application for membership, and review Switzerland's application for membership in the International Court of Justice.</p>
<p>[United Press, Paris, 28th] French Foreign Minister Schuman and retired Canadian Prime Minister Mackenzie King continued Bevin's attacks on the Soviet Union in the General Assembly today.</p>
<p>King spoke first, condemning the Soviet Union for deliberately obstructing the "political and economic construction of the post-war world" and undermining the United Nations. He also praised countries that seek security "without being bogged down in the world." Finally, he suggested that the United States' atomic energy control plan, since only the Soviet Union opposes it, could be implemented and developed by the world without Soviet participation.</p>
<p>Schuman followed, accusing the Soviet Union's blockade of Berlin as an "act of force." He denounced the Soviet Union for lacking the "minimum of goodwill" to solve issues such as the four-power co-management of Berlin and Germany. Schuman echoed King, saying that the United Nations has failed and is now standing at a crossroads. He pointed out that the factors of failure lie in the world being divided into two ideological groups and the Soviet Union "overusing its veto power." Schuman responded to the US Secretary of State's assurance that he was determined "not to allow us to lose our rights and abandon the people we are responsible for protecting." Schuman said: "We are now living in an era of broad economic units and political agreements, so Europe should unite to survive." Schuman also proposed France's heartfelt plan - a European Federation. He said: Europe should "unite to survive" and called on governments to act quickly. Therefore, the focus is once again placed on the development of regional organizations to assist the United Nations, which has been undermined by the Soviet Union and is on the verge of failure.</p>

<p>[Report from this newspaper] Paris, 28th Radio Broadcast: Belgian Foreign Minister Spaak spoke at the General Assembly on the 28th, warning the Soviet Union that the Western countries will never succumb to communism, just as they resisted Hitler's totalitarianism. Spaak accused the Soviet Union of deploying fifth columns in Western countries. Hitler's fifth columns seemed like boy scout troops in comparison. Spaak also addressed Vyshinsky's claim that the Western powers have aggressive intentions towards the Soviet Union, saying, "Our policy is based on fear of the Soviet Union."</p>

<p>[United Press, Chillicothe, Texas, 27th] US Ambassador to the Soviet Union Smith met with President Truman for about three hours on the campaign travel train today. Afterwards, he told reporters that US-Soviet relations have now entered a more critical stage than at any time since the war. When asked by reporters if "this will lead to war," he replied, "It is difficult for me to answer this question." When asked by reporters whether the actions of the three powers would increase the chances of war, he replied "no." He also said, "If we act with patience and prudence, war can be avoided."</p>

<p>[United Press, Paris, 28th] The United Nations General Assembly decided on the 28th, despite the strong protests of South African representative Louw, to debate again the racial discrimination case in South Africa proposed by India. Louw first argued and protested, claiming that the case was entirely within the jurisdiction of South Africa, and that if the United Nations intervened because India had demands on South Africa, it would exceed the jurisdiction stipulated in the Charter, and the United Nations had no power to make a judgment on such matters of member states. General Assembly President Evatt of Australia mildly rebuked Louw, saying that the issue of the limits of the General Assembly's jurisdiction belonged to the Assembly's subsidiary committee, and that the committee would vote on it. Evatt finally ruled that the General Assembly's jurisdiction should be transferred to the General Committee, and India's racial discrimination complaint should remain on the agenda for debate.</p>

<h3 id="e40">Soviet Union Proposes New Flight Control Regulations, Attempting to Disrupt the Berlin Airlift; Western Authorities Reject Outright <a href="#e40" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c40" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">40</a></h3>
<p>[United Press Berlin, 27th] US senior officials stated on the 27th: The Soviet Union has recently proposed a set of "regulations" to the Berlin Four-Power Air Safety Control Authority, which would disrupt the Western countries' airlift to Berlin. The rules proposed by the Soviet Union would prohibit instrument flying and would give the Soviet Union the right to drive away any aircraft attempting to land at Tempelhof Airport in the American sector of Berlin. The Soviet authorities intend to force Western countries to accept these regulations, insisting that these new regulations will now control flights. However, the American, British, and French military governments have rejected them outright.</p>
<p>An American official stated, "These regulations can be summed up in one sentence: to make the airlift impossible." The Soviet regulations are: (1) "Prohibition of night flights along the air corridors," which would eliminate 50 to 60 percent of current airlift operations. (2) "Prohibition of flights in dense cloud cover," which would eliminate 30 to 50 percent of daytime airlift operations. (3) "Flights over the occupation zones of Greater Berlin must be approved by the respective occupying power." (4) "Flights are prohibited along the air corridors or near landing and takeoff airports when there is wind, rain, fog, icing, or other similar conditions."</p>

<p>[Agence France-Presse Wiesbaden, 27th] US Air Force General Curtis LeMay, currently stationed in Europe, told reporters that the United States will soon send an additional 100 C-54 aircraft to participate in the Berlin airlift. Each of these aircraft can carry ten tons. During the winter months, Berlin needs at least 4,000 tons of supplies per day, but 4,700 tons is considered a safer margin. When asked what the US attitude would be if the Soviet Union continued its obstruction tactics, LeMay replied that the US Air Force would continue its requisitioning plan. LeMay has now been appointed as the head of the US Strategic Air Command. His position in Berlin will soon be replaced by General Kunkel.</p>

<p>[Agence France-Presse Paris, 28th] The Hyderabad delegation stated in its note to the President of the United Nations Security Council that the presentation of the Hyderabad issue to the Security Council is an indisputable matter. They expressed satisfaction with the Security Council's attitude regarding the Hyderabad incident. The note stated that the Hyderabad delegation considers this attitude of the Security Council to mean that it views India's invasion of Hyderabad as an act of force and does not grant India any legal rights. The note also stated that a regime of terror and persecution has been implemented in the state. The conclusion of the note states that the Security Council has an unshirkable duty to study the situation in Hyderabad and bring an end to this fait accompli. The Hyderabad delegation further suggested that, because the Indian occupying forces are implementing strict press censorship in Hyderabad, the Security Council should send an observer to Hyderabad for a personal inspection.</p>

<p>[United Press Washington, 28th] In its third annual report released on the 28th, the International Monetary Fund stated that if we hope for economic recovery to be completed before the end of US aid in 1952, countries receiving aid from the Economic Cooperation Administration must expand exports to the Western Hemisphere. The report expressed general pessimism about the world's economic and financial situation.</p>
<p>The report stated that the IMF still does not see an easy solution to the balance of payments problem between European countries and the United States. It also pointed out that in the past year, despite grant and loan assistance, the trend of depletion of reserves and deterioration of national financial conditions has worsened in almost all countries. The report also stated that unless governments can balance budgets and take other steps to prevent inflation, the recovery plan may "fail." The report also called on countries threatened by inflation in Europe, the Western Hemisphere, and the Far East to reduce consumption and increase taxes in order to achieve a cash budget surplus.</p>

<p>[United Press New Delhi, 27th] Reliable sources stated on the 27th that India may secede from Britain and declare itself a republic before the end of this year. It is reported that Prime Minister Nehru has been authorized to suggest at the British Commonwealth conference in London that India be formally declared a republic, while maintaining some relationship with Britain. This agreement must be approved by the Constituent Assembly, which will be convened after Nehru returns to India from the London conference. Most members of the ruling Congress Party advocate maintaining a genuine connection with Britain, while the Socialist Party and the Communist Party advocate complete separation from Britain. Therefore, the Cabinet and the Congress Party authorized Nehru to study a compromise. It is rumored that the Congress Party believes that complete separation would provide the British Conservative Party with campaign material, which would be tantamount to undermining the Labor Party, which granted India dominion status. It is rumored that Nehru will propose that India, as a republic "associated" with the United Kingdom, remain a member of the Sterling Area and will ask Britain to assist in training its British-equipped army. The final decision on the plan rests with the Constituent Assembly, which will soon vote on the draft constitution drafted last year.</p>

<p>The Asian Century Has Already Begun</p>
<p>We must recognize that the construction of the world from now on will be centered on Asia. We can say that with the end of World War II, the Asian century has begun. The world's richest and undeveloped resources are in Asia. Asia has one billion people, and the lowest living standards are also in Asia. The main problem for Asia in the future is how to develop its own resources, manufacture its own goods, and improve the living standards of the Asian people. This work must be carried out by all Asian countries and nations, uniting and cooperating according to the spirit of the United Nations Charter regarding economic cooperation and in coordination with the work of the Economic Commission for Asia and the Far East, forming a mutually complementary, mutually beneficial Asian regional economic group. In this Asian economic group, China has an unshirkable responsibility to take the initiative. If we do not underestimate ourselves, this regional economic plan should be formulated by China in consultation with the relevant countries, and this joint construction work should be led by China. And a peaceful and democratic Japan certainly cannot be excluded from this circle. Only by thinking about the future of the entire Asia can a peaceful and democratic Japan be given its due status. Before Japan's defeat, Japanese militarists once put forward the slogan of the "Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere." That co-prosperity sphere was an economic zone with Japan as the master and other Asian nations as slaves. It was an economic zone with extreme aggression and exclusiveness. Precisely because of the existence of Japanese militarism, Asia's economy could not develop in a balanced way. Now that Japanese militarism has been destroyed, the possibility of establishing a truly mutually beneficial and mutually supportive Asian regional economic group has only just begun. Therefore, we should, on the one hand, prevent the revival of Japanese militarism so that it no longer poses a threat to peace, and on the other hand, guide the progress of Japanese economic democratization so that Japan's strengths, that is, the scientific knowledge that Japan has accumulated in the past fifty years and the industrious and hardworking nature of the Japanese people, can make a full contribution to Asian economic construction. Therefore, we should, under the grand principle of preventing Japan from rearming and coordinating with the overall economic construction of Asia, conditionally support Japan's recovery.</p>
<p>Overall Interests, Far-Reaching Measures</p>
<p>Recalling that at the beginning of the end of the war against Japan, our President was the first to declare that China would not adopt a policy of national retribution against Japan. The Japanese people were deeply moved by this statement. The so-called "no retribution," in a negative sense, expresses the magnanimity of our nation. In a positive sense, it must be expressed in the country's policies. That is to say, when we deal with the Japanese issue, we must not only passively refrain from retribution, but also actively do something. We must adopt far-reaching measures based on the overall interests of the various Asian countries and nations and the permanent relationship between China and Japan. We should promote the convening of a peace conference with Japan. We should, under an overall Asian plan, determine the economic relations between China and Japan and between China and other countries. Asia's economy must be developed and prospered, but economic development must be balanced, prosperity must be comprehensive, and the survival and security of Asian nations must be guaranteed, but national survival must be autonomous, and security must be collective. The two issues of economic development and prosperity and national survival and security are inseparable. We must first and foremost secure the freedom of Asian nations from common want, and then we can truly secure the freedom of Asian nations from common fear. The Japanese issue is ultimately an Asian issue. By considering and handling the Japanese issue within the context of the entire Asian issue, all historical grievances and post-war doubts will naturally be correctly resolved.</p>
<p>These are my personal views on the current Japanese issue. I would like to present them here for correction to my compatriots throughout the country. I respectfully ask those who are concerned about the Japanese issue to provide guidance and discuss them together. I am deeply gratified.</p>

<h3 id="e54">First Batch of Enemy and Puppet Real Estate to be Sold Today; Notices to be Distributed to Residents in Three Days; Shao Daoshi's Military Residence Most Expensive, Estimated Value Exceeds 600,000 Gold Yuan; Current Residents are Mostly Government Agencies and Leaders from All Walks of Life <a href="#e54" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c54" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">54</a></h3>
<p>[This Newspaper] The first batch of 80 units of enemy and puppet real estate in this city has been officially announced for sale by the China Trust Bureau today. This batch of real estate consists mostly of garden villas or detached houses, which are the finest enemy and puppet real estate in this city. The total value accounts for 20% of the total value of enemy and puppet real estate in this city. According to the China Trust Bureau's announcement, the current residents of each unit of real estate should, within ten days of receiving the notice from the Bureau's Real Estate Department, exercise their right of first refusal to purchase the property at the price listed in the notice, and pay half of the price as a deposit. The remaining balance must be paid in full within one month from the date of the notice. Failure to pay within the deadline will result in forfeiture of the deposit. If the current residents do not purchase the property within ten days, it will be considered a waiver and will be publicly auctioned without further notice. However, current residents may still participate in the bidding. If the current residents do not win the bid, they must vacate the property within one month from the date of expiration of the notice for the right of first refusal. Failure to do so will be enforced by the competent authority.</p>
<p>If there are more than one current residents in each unit of the above-mentioned real estate, if each resident intends to purchase the property, they may first negotiate among themselves to elect or recommend one resident to purchase the property. If the dispute cannot be resolved, each resident may go to the China Trust Bureau Real Estate Department to draw lots to determine one resident to purchase the property within ten days after receiving the notice. The China Trust Bureau is not responsible for clearing out the other residents in the same unit of real estate purchased by the original resident. The Bureau is responsible for requiring all original residents to vacate the properties purchased at auction within the prescribed period. According to the reporter's investigation, the current occupants of this batch of real estate are mostly acting in their individual names, but some are acting in the name of government agencies. The latter will be more difficult to handle. The China Trust Bureau is currently busy assessing the value of the properties, which is based on the prevailing market price in accordance with the regulations of the Executive Yuan. Notices will be distributed to the residents in three days.</p>
<p>The Lowest Price is Tens of Thousands of Gold Yuan per House</p>
<p>It is understood that the two houses at 80 Yuqing Road and 262 Hunan Road have the highest estimated value, both exceeding 600,000 Gold Yuan. The house at 80 Yuqing Road was originally the residence of Shao Daoshi's army and is currently occupied by the Municipal Party Committee. The lowest estimated value is also tens of thousands of Gold Yuan per house. Among the current residents are prominent figures of the Nationalist Government, such as Vice President Li, Bai Chongxi, Chen Yi, Wu Tiecheng, and Zou Lu. Among them, Vice President Li's residence was originally occupied by Feng Yuxiang and was only recently allocated for Li's residence in Shanghai. It is currently being cleaned and renovated. However, Li has never visited the residence during his recent trip to Shanghai. According to Huang Xuecun, secretary of the Presidential Palace who accompanied Li to Shanghai, Li has never discussed the matter of allocating the residence for his use, so there is no preparation for purchasing it. In addition, some of the current residents of this batch of real estate are acting in the names of their family members, such as Ren Xianqun, the former chairman of the Shanghai Municipal People's Survey Committee and the current chairman of the Zhejiang Commodity Distribution Committee, whose residence at 115 East Sports Association Road is registered in the name of his wife, Zhang Yunqian. Other well-known figures include Zhao Zhiyao, He Yaozu, Fang Dong, Tang Zong, Cha Liangjian, Chen Zhiping, Li Gufan, Deng Baoguang, Gong Tianwu, Zhu Qingzeng, and Han Deqin.</p>

<p>[This Newspaper] The Central Government, in accordance with Article 12, Paragraph 2 of the August 19th Financial and Economic Emergency Ordinance and the Regulations for Strengthening Economic Control, has formulated measures to ban the sale of imported luxury goods. The Municipal Social Affairs Bureau is responsible for implementing the ban in this city, which is scheduled to take effect on October 1st. Violators will have their goods confiscated. It is reported that the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau has not yet received the implementation order. The jewelry and diamond industry in this city recently submitted a petition to the Municipal Council regarding the ban on the sale of imported luxury goods, stating the importance of the industry. It is claimed that 400,000 people nationwide rely on the industry for their livelihood. They believe that banning foreign imports is acceptable, but banning domestic sales is inappropriate. The Municipal Council intends to forward this request to the Executive Yuan for review.</p>
<h3 id="e56">Automobile and Gasoline Conservation Meeting: Regulations Stipulating Implementation Methods for Reduction, Following the Principle of Four-Out-of-One or Two-Out-of-One, Reducing 600 Vehicles, Licenses Temporarily Not Revoked <a href="#e56" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c56" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">56</a></h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The municipal government convened an automobile and gasoline conservation meeting yesterday morning at 10:00 AM, chaired by Mayor Wu. After discussion, it was resolved to submit three plans for reducing automobile gasoline consumption, based on the "Private Use Automobile Restriction Regulations" promulgated by the Executive Yuan, to the Executive Yuan for approval. Starting next month, the city will temporarily implement the third plan. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Plan One: (A) Official vehicles of government agencies, and private legal entities that meet the identity requirements stipulated in the Executive Yuan's automobile restriction regulations (i.e., banks, factories, mines, and large-scale private enterprises related to people's daily necessities): shall be reduced according to the principle of "four-out-of-one" (combining large and small vehicles). (B) Doctors shall be reduced according to the principle of "two-out-of-one." (C) Automobiles of private individuals or private legal entities that do not meet the identity requirements stipulated by the Executive Yuan shall be completely reduced.</p>
<p>Plan Two: (A) Official vehicles of government agencies and vehicles of qualified private legal entities shall be handled in accordance with item (A) of Plan One. (B) Vehicles of private legal entities that do not meet the identity requirements (such as shops, small factories, various church organizations, etc.) and vehicles owned by qualified private individuals shall be reduced according to the principle of "two-out-of-one" (combining large and small vehicles). (C) For automobiles of private individuals who do not meet the identity requirements, each household may retain one vehicle, and all others shall be completely reduced.</p>
<p>Plan Three: (A) Official vehicles of government agencies (regardless of central or local government agencies) and vehicles of qualified private legal entities (i.e., banks, factories, mines, and large-scale private enterprises related to people's daily necessities, details in the attached document) that meet the identity requirements stipulated in the Executive Yuan's "Private Use Automobile Restriction Regulations" shall be reduced according to the principle of "four-out-of-one" based on their original registered household (combining large and small vehicles). (B) In addition to official vehicles of government agencies, this plan refers to the principle of reducing vehicles by "four-out-of-one" or "two-out-of-one" to conserve gasoline. The gasoline allocation is divided into the following two types: (1) Vehicles that should be retained, accounting for three-quarters or one-half, will be allocated gasoline according to the future stipulated amount. (2) Vehicles that should be reduced, accounting for one-quarter or one-half, will be temporarily allocated gasoline. Large vehicles (i.e., trucks) will be temporarily given a basic gasoline amount of 20 gallons per month, and small vehicles will be temporarily given a basic gasoline amount of 10 gallons per month. The licenses will not be revoked temporarily. The number of vehicles exceeding four or two, but not fully reaching four or two, will also be handled in this manner. (C) The methods for conserving gasoline in this plan are as follows: (1) Private legal entities that meet the identity requirements will be handled according to the principle of "four-out-of-one." (2) Private individuals who meet the identity requirements and private legal entities that do not meet the identity requirements will be handled according to the principle of "two-out-of-one." (3) For private individuals who do not meet the identity requirements, regardless of the number of vehicles they own, the licenses will not be revoked temporarily, and the gasoline allocation will be the same as item (B)(2) of this plan. (D) The effects and impact of implementing the third plan: (1) According to the above methods, the actual number of vehicles reduced will be approximately 600, and the number of unemployed drivers will also be approximately 600. (2) Excluding large vehicles (i.e., trucks) that do not meet the identity requirements stipulated in the Executive Yuan's regulations, which will be temporarily allocated 20 gallons of gasoline per month, and small vehicles that will be temporarily allocated 10 gallons of gasoline per month, the gasoline allocation for all other vehicles must be issued at 70% of the current allocation amount.</p>

<p>Furthermore, according to a statement by the China National Aviation Corporation yesterday, Hu Hao applied to the Garrison Headquarters for permission to go to Hong Kong in accordance with the procedures and was approved. His name was listed on the passenger list of the company that day.</p>

<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The National Electrical Industry Association held a standing board of directors meeting at the Bank of Communications yesterday, chaired by Chairman Qian Xinzhi, to discuss the electricity fee issue for September. Various power plants stated that the coal allocated by the Fuel Management Committee for public utilities did not include the "August 19th" price limit, and if the electricity fee is still collected according to the August 19th price, the power plants will not be able to bear the losses and will be unable to maintain operations. Therefore, it was resolved to send representatives to Nanjing to petition the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, requesting that the Fuel Management Committee comply with the orders of the Executive Yuan and the Ministry, calculate the coal price according to August 1st, and return the overcharged coal price. It was also passed that this year's annual meeting will be held in Taiwan.</p>

<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The District Prosecutor's Office recently filed charges against Bao Guochang, manager of Shinyi Pharmaceutical Factory, and several pharmacies for arbitrarily raising prices after August 19th.

<h3 id="e67">Chinese and Western Restaurant Industries Declare War on Vegetable Vendors: Refuse to Buy Black Market Vegetables, Willing to Accept Business Losses <a href="#e67" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c67" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">67</a></h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The city's Restaurant and Vegetable Association will jointly launch a "No Buying Black Market Vegetables Movement" with the Western Restaurant Industry Association starting on October 1st. According to the two associations, this move is entirely to inspire the conscience of those engaged in the vegetable business, to make them realize the difficult times, abide by government laws and regulations, and consider the welfare of the public, and not to greedily seek excessive profits. The two industries stated that since the authorities announced the price limits on vegetables, they have been most affected. Each restaurant sells mostly chicken, duck, fish, and meat, but the large amount of chicken, duck, fish, and meat is almost entirely obtained from the black market because the supply in each vegetable market is limited. However, on the other hand, the dishes they sell cannot but be based on the price limit, so the losses in the past month have been huge. In order to seek compensation, they resolutely launched this movement. Starting next month, the sales in the restaurant will still be normal, but will be limited to vegetables that can be purchased within the price limit. Therefore, large-scale banquets will not only temporarily disappear, but even ordinary diners will feel that the dishes are not abundant. According to the two industries, this movement will continue until the vegetable industry can understand and cooperate. During this period, they are willing to accept business losses.</p>
<p>[Another Report] Vegetable vendors are difficult to manage. Before going to Beijing, Chiang Ching-kuo had instructions to establish a special team to be responsible for solving the problem, but in fact it has not been established yet, and everything still needs to be dealt with after Chiang Ching-kuo returns to Shanghai.</p>

<p>North Station Decides on Handling Principles</p>
<p>Since the authorities implemented price controls, two-way single-load carriers have become particularly active. Because of this, the Economic Supervisor's Office prohibited the outward transport of rice, cloth, etc. from Shanghai starting on the 26th, and strengthened inspection work. The North Station took the following three measures for passengers who privately carry cloth: (1) Those who were indeed unaware of this prohibition and did not conceal the cloth they were carrying were ordered to return their tickets and return the cloth to its original location, and no penalty was imposed on them. (2) If a legitimate passenger knew that they could not carry cloth but attempted to pass through by chance, the inspectors would also advise them to return their tickets. If they refused to return their tickets and intended to bribe or use other improper methods, they would be punished according to the severity of the circumstances. (3) Single-load carriers who are engaged in the business of transporting cloth know that they cannot export it, but hide the cloth on their bodies or in suitcases and clothing. If they are caught after inspection, in addition to not being allowed to return their tickets, they will be punished according to law.</p>

<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] At 8:10 PM yesterday, a tram number 610 from the American Company Second Road had just departed from Jing'an Temple Station and was slowly traveling east. When it passed the door of the Santai Hardware Store at 642 Jing'an Temple Road (where it is a single track), several sedans were also traveling east. Suddenly, a No. 10 public bus (registration number 03-0499) sped up and attempted to pass between the sedans and the tram. With a slight carelessness, it hit the left side of the first section of the tram. With a loud noise, the tram was pushed off the track, and all four wheels came off (see photo taken by our newspaper Okamoto). Fortunately, it did not overturn, so there were no deaths or injuries. However, because all four wheels of the tram were derailed at the same time and the brakes lost control, the front of the car moved sideways to the left and stopped when it hit a large tree on the sidewalk. For a time, traffic was blocked, and pedestrians gathered to watch, all feeling that it was a rare event to see a tram running onto the sidewalk. The tram driver No. 128 also said: "I have never encountered this situation in more than ten years of driving trams." Afterwards, the tram company immediately sent a machine to put the tram that was blocking the road back on track, and everything returned to normal at 9:05 PM.</p>

<h3 id="e71">Violation of the Exchange Law Case: District Court Pronounces Sentence Yesterday, Lin Legeng and Others Sentenced to Seven to Ten Months <a href="#e71" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c71" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">71</a></h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The case of stockbroker Lin Le(geng) and Du Weiping, Tao Liguolan, Xu Yangshuyao, etc., selling stocks in violation of the Exchange Law was pronounced by the District Court yesterday. The main text is: "Tao Liguolan engaged in empty trading outside the exchange based on the market price of the exchange, exclusively calculating profits and losses, sentenced to ten months of imprisonment.</p>
<p>Du Weiping jointly and continuously bought and sold outside the exchange to the entrustor using the same calculation method, sentenced to eight months of imprisonment.</p>
<p>Lin Legeng jointly bought and sold outside the exchange to the entrustor using the same calculation method, sentenced to eight months of imprisonment.</p>
<p>Xu Yangshuyao engaged in empty trading outside the exchange based on the market price of the exchange, exclusively calculating profits and losses, sentenced to seven months of imprisonment."</p>
<p>Yesterday morning around 8:00 AM, the defendants were brought from the First Detention Center on Massenet Road. More than a hundred family members, with heavy hearts, came to court to listen. At 10:00 AM, Presiding Judge Shen Tianbao and Judges Mei Erhe and Fang Xianghai, and Prosecutor Ding Tongjun, took their seats and announced the sentence in the Eighth Criminal Court. They first announced the reasons to the defendants, and then recited the main text of the judgment, and stated that the judgment would be delivered within two days. If they did not agree with the judgment, they could file an appeal within ten days. The defendants listened to the sentence and showed no expression. Tao Liguolan then showed a bitter smile, while Xu Yangshuyao immediately burst into tears, weeping uncontrollably, and was immediately taken out of court and returned to custody. The reasons for the judgment listed in the judgment are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>"The law stipulates that brokers may not use the same or similar calculation methods for entrustors for the buying and selling entrusted to them if they are not buying, selling, or delivering within the exchange to which they belong. Brokers who violate this regulation shall be punished according to Article 53. Furthermore, those who engage in empty trading outside the exchange based on the market price of the exchange, exclusively calculating profits and losses, shall be sentenced to imprisonment of not more than one year or a fine of not more than 3,000 yuan, as stipulated in Articles 38 and 53 of the Exchange Law. In this case, the defendants,</p>
<p>Regarding the facts, Du Weiping admitted in the police station that he sold 16 million shares of Yongs yarn to Lin Legeng on August 16 and 12 million shares of Yongs yarn to Dong A'er and others on August 19, all of which were off-exchange transactions without accounting for checking. Lin Legeng admitted that he purchased 16 million shares of Yongs yarn from Du Weiping, which was an off-exchange transaction. Tao Liguolan and Xu Yangshuyao admitted that they each sold 2 million shares of Yongs yarn on August 19. During the trial in this court, in addition to the testimonies of Tao Liguolan and Xu Yangshuyao being the same as in the police station, Du Jiping stated that the affairs of Hongxing Securities Company were the responsibility of Qiu Yunfeng, who is on the run, and the affairs of Huamei Industrial and Trading Company were the responsibility of Sun Shuren. After August 11, he was ill and could not go to take care of the affairs of the company. All off-exchange transactions were done by Qiu Yunfeng, and he himself had no responsibility. Huamei Industrial and Trading Company only called Hongyu Securities Company on behalf of Tao Liguolan and others to notify the purchase and sale of stocks, and did not do stocks on their behalf. Lin Legeng changed his statement, saying that the 16 million shares of Yongs yarn were purchased privately from Hongxing Securities Company, but the previous agreement was canceled due to price discrepancies, and the transaction was not completed. This court investigated that Du Weiping had Hongxing Securities Company and Huamei Industrial and Trading Company set up in the Securities Building and Puyi Building, both of which were engaged in securities. Huamei Industrial and Trading Company,</p>
<p>Equipped with a blackboard (with newspapers sealed on August 21 of this year), amplifiers, intercom telephones, and stock delivery words recorded on the wall, as stated by police officer Wang Sizu. Tao Liguolan and others not only opened accounts, bought and sold stocks, and collected legal tender on the same day, but also saw seven or eight people buying and selling stocks at the same time. If they were not engaged in the stock business on a regular basis, how could so many customers come to Hongxing Company to sell stocks, with the amount of Yongs yarn alone reaching a huge 28 million shares. The scale was not small. If it was not with the permission of the company owner, how could the store friends have so much financial resources to engage in a large number of off-exchange transactions. At the same time, how could the shop owner have never noticed it on a regular basis? Based on reason and emotion, it is even more unbelievable. When he was interrogated jointly with Qiu Yunfeng in the police station, the defendant also admitted that he had instructed Qiu Yunfeng to sell short in advance, and the amount could not be large. 12 million shares were off-exchange transactions without accounting (in the police records of Du and Qiu, those that do not indicate Lin's answer to Qiu's answer are answered by one person with the consent of others, which was explained by police officer Qi Chengshu). Lin Legeng also stated that 16 million shares were not obtained with a transaction order. The 28 million shares of Yongs yarn were purely off-exchange transactions. Hongxing Dengquan Company and Huamei Industrial and Trading Company were both operated under the instructions of the defendant,</p>
<p>Undeniable facts are reversed afterwards in the hope of avoiding responsibility, which is not credible. As for Lin Legeng's purchase of 16 million shares of Yongs yarn, he admitted in the police station that both parties conducted delivery and cleared each other. According to Lin Legeng, who is an important staff member of broker No. 190, the purchase and sale between them is the purchase and sale between brokers. Since it did not go through the exchange, it was an off-exchange transaction. It is not credible that he described it as his own purchase and sale during the trial, and that the transaction was canceled without being completed. Those without broker status who jointly implement the crime with those with broker status should still be regarded as accomplices. They each constitute the crime of buying and selling outside the exchange to which they belong and using the same calculation method for the entrustor in the Exchange Law. Du Weiping, based on a general intention to commit a crime, repeatedly committed the same act, which should be regarded as a continuous offense and treated as one crime. As for Tao Liguolan and Xu Yangshuyao selling Yongs yarn stocks at 9:00 AM on August 19, 2 million shares each, and then buying 2 million shares each at 11:00 AM, in addition to offsetting, each earned 2.4 billion Legal Tender.</p>
<p>Indisputably admitted to their error. It was found that the defendants did not have the stocks beforehand, but sold them short outside the exchange and then purchased them later, purely using the rise and fall of the market price as a kind of gambling-style empty trading, which constitutes the crime of empty trading outside the exchange based on the market price of the exchange, exclusively calculating profits and losses, and is also beyond doubt.</p>
<p>The original purpose of the state's establishment of a stock exchange was to control the stock market, balance stock prices, so as not to rise and fall rapidly, disrupt finance, enable those with floating capital to have a legitimate outlet, and make those who seek exorbitant profits have no way to use their skills. Industry and commerce would be revived, and the market would be stabilized.</p>
<p>With good intentions. However, the defendants, Du Weiping and Lin Legeng, still conducted securities transactions outside the exchange. Tao Liguolan and Xu Yangshuyao implemented empty trading, which is contrary to the purpose of the state's establishment of a stock exchange and promotion of securities trading. They only cared about profits and ignored national policies. If they were not punished by law, it would not be enough to deter them. Therefore, considering the circumstances, within the scope of the statutory principal punishment, Tao Liguolan was sentenced to ten months of imprisonment, Du Weiping and Lin Legeng were sentenced to eight months of imprisonment, and Xu Yangshuyao was sentenced to seven months of imprisonment, to show punishment and achieve the effect of clearing up speculation.</p>
<p>In conclusion, in accordance with the preceding paragraph of Article 291 of the Criminal Procedure Law, Article 38, paragraph 1, paragraph 3, Article 53 of the Exchange Law, Article 11, Article 31, paragraph 1, Article 28, and the preceding paragraph of Article 56 of the Criminal Law, the judgment is as stated in the main text.</p>

<h3 id="e76">Economic Reform's First Month in Guiyang <a href="#e76" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c76" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">76</a></h3>
<p>— Our Correspondent, Liu Mengchi</p>
<p>[Our Correspondent, Guiyang, 24th by Airmail] Guiyang is a city with a population of only 300,000, but it is, after all, one of the provincial capitals in the Southwest. During the eight years of the War of Resistance and the three years of suppression of the rebellion, it has gradually become prosperous in this relatively stable rear area, and has gradually grown to a considerable scale. The current economic reform plan is national and comprehensive. If we only look at Shanghai, Tianjin, Guangzhou, and Wuhan, and not at these remote towns, we will not be able to get a full picture of the effectiveness of the economic reform plan. The reporter hereby reports in detail on the various manifestations of "Economic Reform's First Month" in Guiyang, as follows:</p>
<p>The Guiyang branch of the Central Bank issued gold yuan bills one day later than major cities across the country. According to the bank, on August 23rd, the car transporting the gold yuan bills failed to arrive in Guiyang from Duyun as scheduled, breaking down halfway in Machangping, and only arriving in Guiyang late at night. Therefore, the issuance only began the next day (24th), handling the exchange of gold, silver, foreign currency, and legal tender. Initially, it was only designated that the Central Bank, the Bank of China, and the Bank of Communications would be responsible for the exchange. However, the bank, considering that all banks had been closed for four days and that those waiting to exchange would inevitably be crowded, temporarily added the Farmers Bank, Postal Savings, Cooperative Treasury, and Guiyang Provincial Bank to jointly handle the exchange. The crowding of the first two or three days of the exchange was, of course, inevitable, especially for silver dollars, followed by gold, and then foreign currency, because on August 19th, the price of silver dollars in Guiyang was only 3 million legal tender for head silver and no more than 2.6 or 2.7 million for mixed silver, and gold was 320 or 330 million legal tender per tael. Unless they were fools, no one would be willing to go to the national banks to exchange.</p>
<p>The seventeen or eighteen commercial banks in Guiyang felt the most headache at this time, because the checks or deposit slips issued on August 19th had to be paid in gold yuan cash in accordance with the law, and exchanged at the Central Bank, purely based on the head positions stored in each bank, without any flexibility. And at this time, depositors were</p>
<p>withdrawing cash one after another, facing both internal and external pressure. Therefore, general commercial banks invariably opened their doors late and closed them early in the first two or three days, and managers and cashiers kowtowed and bowed in all directions, trying to maintain stability. Among them, "Ju Kang Bank" even took out a check "only for transfer, not for cash payment" in the confusion, and issued it in gold yuan, falling into the hands of someone who knew the law very well, and later spent a lot of effort to make it right.</p>
<p>The Central Bank's statistics for the four days of August 24, 25, 26, and 28 (i.e., the first week of exchange) showed that 2,268.732 taels of gold, 46,161 silver dollars, 2,429 US dollars, and 600 Hong Kong dollars were exchanged. Most of this amount was made up of silver dollar small plates, public school teachers, or the families of high-ranking officials who still knew how to obey the law. Naturally, the bosses of large silver shops engaged in gold and silver trading also used a very small part of it to smooth things over with the national banks, but the amount was really negligible, and the Central Bank, on the other hand, was not ideal in terms of personnel and technology for identifying the fineness of receipts and ornaments, which was enough of an excuse for those holding large amounts of gold and silver to hesitate. Especially in the first two weeks, the Central Bank did not begin to receive silver ingots, which they had a legitimate reason for (because they lacked specialized technical personnel and tools to identify silver ingots), but it greatly hindered the execution of the law on the exchange of gold for national ownership and the deadline for exchange, and Guizhou Province has always been one of the provinces that practiced the use of silver. This problem was not resolved until September 13, when the Central Bank began to receive silver.</p>
<p>Gold merchants in Guiyang, in the Jiangxi gang, Shaanxi gang, and Sichuan gang, more than 30 silver shops, have considerable funds. They not only trade gold and silver, but also trade Hong Kong dollars, US dollars, department stores, and cloth. They don't hesitate to set up more brands and do everything that can make money. On August 19, the price of gold in Guiyang was 320 to 330 million per tael. After the currency change order, it became 600 million per tael. They still thought it was not enough, so they spread rumors out of thin air in secret, sometimes saying that the black market in Shanghai had reached 800 million, and sometimes saying that the black market in Chongqing had reached 900 million. Their stores only took in, but never sold. Rumors spread quickly, and not only did people with a little gold jewelry not go to the Central Bank to exchange it, but even people without gold jewelry were willing to go through the black market for 700 to 800 million and buy a few coins of gold jewelry to preserve it. Gold was like this, and so were silver dollars. In Guiyang, except for Hong Kong dollars, which had market news, US dollars were rarely mentioned. Therefore, the Central Bank's second week of exchange statistics showed that the gold exchange was less than a quarter of the amount exchanged in the first week (actually only four days), only 504.370 taels. The third week barely exceeded a third of the second week, only 152.696 taels, which was even more disparate than the first week's four-day exchange amount. Fortunately, the Provincial Capital Police Bureau and the Guiyang Municipal Government requested instructions from the Provincial Government, and decided to take action to promote the silver industry to quickly bring all the gold and silver to the national banks to exchange for gold yuan, in order to implement the law. On the morning of September 12, they divided into eight working groups and simultaneously inspected the larger silver shops in a lightning-style manner. As a result, 217 taels of gold jewelry, six gold bars, 922 catties of silver bars, and 152 silver dollars were found in the Li Wenxing, Lao Baoqing, and Lao Baocheng gold shops and their old cabinets. In addition, there were 30 various gems, and Lao Baoqing also hid 11 bundles of white cloth and 4 packages of Indigo, said to be 93 pieces of cloth for storage, and obtained suspicious documents for selling gold jewelry at high prices. This has always been the manipulation of Guiyang's gold market</p>
<p>The gold tigers Yuan Dequan, Li Mantang, Li Haisheng, Gan Huanlin, and Lü Xuehai were captured and transferred to the Provincial Security Command for interrogation. As expected, after the economic reform plan was supported by this political force, the Central Bank's fourth week of gold exchange immediately rose in a straight line, from 152.696 taels in the third week to 444.406 taels. Silver dollars, silver, US dollars, and Hong Kong dollars were all ten times and six times more than the third week. After the Guiyang gold tigers were captured, the financial market gradually became calm.</p>
<p>However, Xiao Chunqiu Evening News was careless in cutting and pasting, and on September 14, it reprinted the Chongqing September 8 Dagong Evening News "Five-Cent Silver Dollars Temporarily Not in Circulation" news. Citizens mistakenly thought that "Five-Cent Nickel Coins Temporarily Not in Circulation." In less than half a day, people were panicked, and the market refused to use them, almost causing a major storm. Fortunately, the authorities took appropriate measures, immediately summoned the person in charge of the newspaper, and punished the newspaper by suspending publication for one month. On one side, the Central Bank issued an official message, earnestly correcting it, and the market returned to normal. Recently, because the copper coins of half a cent and two cents have not been formally announced by the Central Bank headquarters to be in general circulation, but a large number of them are circulating among the people, disputes still arise from time to time. Although this problem is not of great importance, it is still a problem that has not been resolved.</p>
<p>The gold yuan notes currently in circulation in Guiyang are mostly ten yuan and five yuan notes. One yuan notes are rare. Fortunately, a large number of nickel coins were left here during the War of Resistance, and there is no problem with market change. However, various counties in Guizhou Province feel very painful, and civil transactions are particularly inconvenient. Recently, the Central Bank decided that the one yuan gold yuan notes and one or two cent subsidiary notes should be as much as possible</p>
<p>Transported to various counties for circulation, which may be a slight solution. Unfortunately, the postal remittance bureaus set up in various counties, regardless of the domestic remittance rate within the province or outside the province, are still higher than the exchange rate set by other national banks, which has not been able to fully cooperate with the county and township financial circulation, which is a fly in the ointment.</p>
<p>After the currency reform, the first problem that arose was prices. Prices in Guiyang, except for imported goods, have always been lower than in Shanghai. The reasons are that this is almost a purely agricultural economy, and people's lives are unusually frugal. Secondly, the exchange rate between Guiyang and Shanghai was abnormal at that time. If you exchanged 7.5 million legal tender in Guiyang, you could get 10 million in Shanghai, which means that merchants could earn 2.5 million for every 10 million just by doing exchange, so prices in Guiyang were lower. What's more, the price of gold and silver between Guiyang and Shanghai was very different, and the market price was always based on gold and silver and rice. After the currency reform, the law stipulated that prices throughout the country must be frozen at the local figures on "August 19." However, the price of gold and silver in Guiyang on "August 19" was almost more than double that of Shanghai. Now, using the law to make it consistent with Shanghai, no wonder those engaged in commerce, industrial production, or purely consumption, all unanimously expect prices to rise. Therefore, after the currency change order was issued, before the municipal government's price limit was determined, the entire city of Guiyang almost became a market without transactions, shouting prices randomly, and trying to purchase as much as possible, reflecting that the people's psychology had reached extreme anxiety.</p>
<p>At this time, the provincial and municipal authorities obtained very reliable information that "anonymous people" had remitted more than one million gold yuan from Guangzhou to Guiyang</p>
<p>To purchase materials. The Farmers Bank alone had 600,000 to 700,000 gold yuan. Merchants watched prices across the country and stubbornly refused to release them for more than two weeks. The authorities felt that the law on freezing "August 19" prices could not be implemented, and feared that after the materials were smuggled to Guangzhou, the Guiyang market would not be able to be maintained, so they conducted extensive discussions. As a result, it was decided that "all goods imported from outside the province would be priced according to the price at the place of origin, plus transportation costs to Guiyang, plus legal profits," and "all goods produced in the province would be priced according to the wholesale price at the place of origin, plus transportation costs to Guiyang, plus legal profits," as the basis for price limits. Based on this principle, the average daily necessities were increased by 40% to 50% compared with the "August 19" price, and the goods produced in the province were increased by an average of 70% to 80%, and some even exceeded more than double. For example, the price of rice on "August 19" was 13 million legal tender per dou, which was increased to 27 million yuan, equivalent to 90 cents in gold yuan. This is really the chairman of Gu Zhenglun's helpless effort to protect the province's agricultural products and improve the lives of farmers. Even so, merchants still do not release materials. Until today, either materials are smuggled, or substandard goods are used to get by, and even meat shortages and rice shortages are becoming more and more serious. A phenomenon occurred the other day in which poor people jumped into the river and committed suicide because they could not buy rice.</p>
<p>The reason for this phenomenon in Guiyang is that merchants do not understand the essence of the economic reform plan. For example, the Municipal Council, which is meeting these days, openly only knows the interests of merchants. With the serious rice shortage these days as the topic, it uses its "compassionate" tone, seemingly attempting to first abolish the rice price limit as a foundation for overturning all price limits. They decided at the first meeting on September 20 that "rice will not be subject to price limits for the time being," and immediately wanted Mayor Zhang Zhixiang to accompany them to the Provincial Government to</p>
<p>achieve the purpose of temporarily not limiting prices. Although it was through the Secretary-General of the Provincial Government (Gu Zhenglun traveled to Qianxi Dading) Pan Xiyuan, to come up with a one keep the price limit, let the high-grade rice be natural" mysterious conclusion. The meeting also resolved at the third meeting yesterday (22nd): "I hope the municipal government will change the past rigid control of food prices and give prices a little flexibility," and "do not let the police interfere again." In this era of "democracy" singing loudly, the municipal government had no choice but to accept and implement it. Therefore, since the 22nd, rice merchants have been smiling and rice has been appearing one after another. The price is one yuan and five jiao for high-grade rice, and the difference is one yuan for medium-grade rice. The so-called low-grade rice or brown rice is simply not available, and the government's limited nine jiao and one dou has become a thing of the past. It is fortunate that the rice shortage problem has been solved.</p>
<p>After the rice problem is solved, the citizens' attention is now shifting to the meat and vegetable shortage phenomenon, hoping to be relieved accordingly, and some municipal councilors believe that the supply of rice and pork has some connection, and both come from the countryside, so they should be removed eliminate the price limit. The municipal government said that it should still be strictly limited and will no longer "lean on them". What is deeply worried by people of insight is that Guizhou is an agricultural economy, and the prices of all goods and services have always been based on the price of rice. Now that the rice price limit is cancelled and free transactions are allowed, all prices and labor prices may be cancelled, which will increase the difficulty of implementing the economic reform plan. I hope that the relevant parties will quickly find a remedy.</p>

<p>[Our Correspondent, Ningbo, 28th] At about 4:00 AM on the 26th, the Guan Haiwei Police Station in Cibei dispatched several police officers to patrol the Jiang area in front of the garrison. Coincidentally, the search brigade of the Suppression of Rebellion Task Force was also patrolling the area. The two sides had not agreed on a signal beforehand. It was late at night, and it was impossible to distinguish between soldiers and bandits. Suddenly, gunfire was heard, causing a misunderstanding between the two sides, and they fired at each other. After both sides realized what was happening, they stopped firing. Three police officers had been shot and killed, and one resident was injured.</p>

<p>[Our Correspondent, Ningbo, 28th] At 9:00 PM on the 24th of this month, the Sixth Company of the National Army's Xiong Battalion stationed on Jintang Island in the Western District of Dinghai suddenly suffered a mutiny. One platoon leader and one deputy squad leader were killed on the spot. After investigating the process of the rebellion, it was found to be caused by new recruits deserting. The first platoon of the company stationed at Puji Temple in Liuhang had several new recruits, all of whom were from Gaoyou, Jiangsu. They attempted to escape the night before last, and at about 9:00 PM, they shot and killed the platoon leader Xiong Shan and the deputy squad leader, and then collectively fled towards Dafeng Township. The deserters arrived at Dapukou at 11:00 PM that night. A squad of soldiers was also stationed there, but they were unaware of the rebellion and did not take precautions. The squad leader Guan Zhiyi was also shot and killed, and two ships were pulled from the pier, forcing the soldiers there to escape with them. It was high tide at the time, and they took advantage of the favorable current to escape. After hearing the news, the company immediately sent troops to pursue them, but the rebels had already fallen into the sea and could not be caught. It was also heard that the rebels took away two machine guns, fifteen rifles, one submachine gun, and more than 5,000 rounds of ammunition.</p>

<h3 id="e83">Will Henan University Return to Kaifeng? Henan People Prevent Southward Move, A Disturbance Occurs at the Station <a href="#e83" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c83" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">83</a></h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent, Kaifeng, 26th by Airmail] Although National Henan University is not a famous university in the country, it is the highest institution of learning in the culturally backward Henan. Before the War of Resistance, it was known for its school buildings, books, and instruments. After the restoration, it was known for its food and fighting. It cannot attend classes for a few days a year. In June of this year, it caught up with the fleeing. After Kaifeng fell, the Ministry ordered the school to resume classes in Suzhou. Therefore, faculty and students successively ran from the flames of war in Kaifeng to the scenic Suzhou. From then on, students of Henan University can be seen everywhere on Tiger Hill, in the Lion Grove, by the Canglang Pavilion, and in the West Garden Temple. Because there is no place to live and attend classes, the students are puzzled. Nanjing, Shanghai, Hangzhou, and Wuxi are also full of students from Henan University. The Ministry of Education repeatedly ordered the school to resume classes as soon as possible. Although the person in charge of the school said that school would start on September 15, then said that school would start on October 15, and finally said that school would start in November, but Vice Minister Tian of the Ministry of Education said discouragedly: "At this rate, I'm afraid classes won't start in December"! The people of Henan, watching their children lose their schooling, and the books and instruments bought with the hard-earned money of the people of Henan being moved to the south of the Yangtze River, really feel sorry. A month ago, they called for Henan University to move back to Kaifeng, saying that Kaifeng was gradually stabilizing. The Provincial Council advocated the most strongly. They shouted loudly: "If the Central Government feels that it is necessary to add a university in Suzhou, the Ministry of Education can allocate funds to set up a National Suzhou University. The books and instruments of Henan cannot be moved to the south of the Yangtze River"! What makes people feel most sorry is the magnificent school building of Henan University that remains empty in Kaifeng. Recently, the Henan University authorities sent personnel to Kaifeng to escort books and instruments south. (Note: This batch of items was originally intended to be transported south, but was detained at the station by the people of Henan.) The Kaifeng Station had to allocate the train because it was ordered by the Ministry of Education. So, while hanging the car, it also informed the Provincial Council. After receiving the letter, the Provincial Council immediately sent a letter to the Provincial Government to prevent it. The Provincial Government then sent the Provincial Police Bureau to detain it. A superintendent of the Provincial Police Bureau led 20 police officers to the station to negotiate. When they arrived, the train had already been fired up and was about to depart. The 20 police officers immediately lined up in front of the train to prevent it from leaving, and at the same time asked the station to immediately unload the items of Henan University. The Henan University escorts came out to argue. After a long time, the passengers on the train were eager to leave. After finding out the reason, 500 or 600 people voluntarily got off the train and unloaded the six carriages of the Henan University train, and shouted: "Why should the things of Henan be transported to the south of the Yangtze River? Whoever doesn't let us unload the car, we'll hit their heads"! After the car was unloaded, it was inspected and found that in addition to books, instruments, and medicines, there was also a large package of cotton. It was heard that the last time it was and, when the car was unloaded, it was also found to be transporting sunflower seeds and peanuts. People are even more dissatisfied with this. At present, this issue is still deadlocked, and it is difficult to predict how it will be resolved in the future.</p>

<h3 id="e85">Unprecedented Natural Disaster in Qinghai <a href="#e85" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c85" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">85</a></h3>
<p>— Special Correspondent for this Newspaper, Sima Bing</p>
<p>[Dispatch from Xining, Qinghai, dated 24th of this month] Since the beginning of summer, Qinghai province has been successively afflicted by severe drought, hail, black frost, and sandstorms. The rural economy is already on the brink of collapse. Unexpectedly, in the last ten days of last month, various regions were subsequently hit by fierce winds and torrential rains, resulting in mountain floods. The affected areas were widespread, causing the most severe natural disaster seen in recent years.</p>
<p>Eve of the Flood</p>
<p>A low-pressure system fiercely struck Qinghai around the 21st of last month. The first to suffer were Huangyuan and Guide counties, followed by Huangzhong and other counties. By the 25th and 26th, the disaster had spread throughout the province. On the eve of the flood in Xining city, around 9 p.m., dark clouds densely covered the sky, followed by a sudden downpour. At the same time, violent winds raged, accompanied by thunder and lightning. Crops were instantly destroyed. Large trees with diameters of one to two feet were uprooted by the wind, standing upside down like dragonflies. Smaller trees were snapped at the waist and blown over a distance of one or two li. In an instant, houses collapsed and walls crumbled, and heart-wrenching cries filled the air! The next day, the heavy rain subsided slightly, and mountain floods erupted in various places. Infrastructure related to national defense construction and people's welfare, such as highway bridges, culverts, canals, and power plants, suffered enormous damage, especially national highways, provincial highways, and major roads, ninety percent of which were destroyed. The large-scale water conservancy projects "Chang Sheng," "Qing Kai," "Ping An," and "Ge Gong," which had just begun construction this year, were all destroyed.</p>
<p>Farmers Weeping in the Fields</p>
<p>The Qinghai artificial forests, renowned throughout the country, lost over two million trees of all sizes washed away in this torrential rain. Farmland was flooded, covered in sand, and silted up. Homes, stacks of soybeans and wheat, and livestock were washed away or drowned, a truly heartbreaking sight. Prior to this, black frost fell repeatedly in various places, causing all crops awaiting harvest to freeze and wither completely. According to reports, more than 30 townships in seven counties, including Huangyuan and Tongren, were affected. In Huangyuan County alone, the affected area was 4,460.2 mu, resulting in no hope for the autumn harvest. Elsewhere, prolonged drought occurred without rain, and crops were affected by diseases and pests. Reports to the provincial government included Huangzhong, Datong, and Guide, covering fourteen townships. In Huangzhong County alone, the affected area reached 41,736.68 mu, with damage exceeding 80 percent. Farmers, young and old, wept in the fields.</p>
<p>A Summary of Losses</p>
<p>According to preliminary statistics from the provincial government, the direct damage caused by this heavy rain includes the following with regards to roads, bridges, and culverts washed away by mountain floods: 114 bridges, 13 culverts, 95 sections of road surface and foundation, 6 ferry boats, and 10 ferry skins. Farmland flooded by mountain floods covers more than 20 townships in five counties, including Xining and Ledu, with over 5,200 mu of farmland flooded, almost entirely silted up with mud and sand. Approximately 200 public and private buildings collapsed. Telecommunications equipment damaged by lightning strikes includes two switchboards of 30 and 20 lines respectively, 5 desk phones, 2 wall phones, 670 utility poles, and approximately 320 jin of electrical wire. The Xining Hydroelectric Power Plant suffered losses of 3,950 gold yuan in this heavy rain. Had it not been for timely repairs, the entire city would have been plunged into terrifying darkness. The losses of over 20 large and small canals, including "Fang Hui," are difficult to estimate. The four canals currently under construction, including "Chang Sheng" and "Qing Kai," alone have already consumed more than 800,000 yuan in currency.</p>
<p>The Start of Repair Work</p>
<p>In order to urgently seek the recovery from the disaster, the relief of the victims, and the revitalization of the province's economy, the provincial government convened an emergency meeting for three days, attended by the heads of various agencies and organizations in the city, the mayors of various counties, representatives of public opinion, members of the provincial legislature, local gentry, and principals of primary and secondary schools. All agreed that the top priority was to repair the roads and restore transportation, and decided on the principle of "no new roads, keep the old roads open." A detailed plan and steps were formulated, requisitioning labor, materials, tools, and transportation from the entire province (i.e., laborers had to provide their own food, fuel, cooking utensils, tents, etc.) to actively carry out repairs. This repair work began on the 21st of this month, and the government appointed the mayors of each county as supervisors. Chairman Ma Bufang stated: "As long as the people of the province, with our spirit of doing things poorly, practically, quickly, and firmly, actively engage in the progress of various projects, we will surely achieve satisfactory results!" In our imagination, the people of Qinghai, under the outstanding leadership of the authorities in the past, were able to complete the Qinghai-Tibet, Qinghai-Xinjiang, and other highways, which are important national defense routes, in a short period of time, creating a miracle in Chinese highway construction. Now, these repair projects should be as easy as turning one's hand.</p>
<p>Important Recovery Measures</p>
<p>However, although the blood vessels of the body are open, the local symptoms should not be allowed to spread and worsen. The reconstruction of other projects in the province, the repair of canals, the replanting of artificial forests, the relief of disaster victims, the reduction and exemption of land taxes, and the replenishment of livestock are all important measures related to national defense and the rural economy, and must be urgently restored. However, Qinghai has a sparse population and financial difficulties. Although the provincial government has telegraphed the central government to allocate 5 million gold yuan in emergency relief funds, it may be enough to relieve the immediate crisis, but it is not enough to plan for recovery. Autumn in the Northwest is short, and a cold and long winter is coming. We face hundreds of thousands of victims shivering in the autumn wind, and we understand the situation in Qinghai, sandwiched between Xinjiang and Tibet. For the sake of people's livelihood and national defense, we need the authorities and the people of the whole country to extend a hand of sympathy and assistance!</p>

<p>Regarding the matter of banks reporting bounced checks due to insufficient funds or overdrafts during check clearing, it is reported that the Ministry of Finance stipulates that relevant banks may record such incidents and submit a list to the local Financial Management Bureau for review the following day. In areas without a Financial Management Bureau, the list should be submitted to the local Central Bank for verification and notification to the relevant banks, who will then report the matter to the court.

<h3 id="e87">Prices Are High, Goods Are Scarce: Premium Japonica Rice Has Buyers but No Sellers, Flour Market Remains Stagnant, Edible Oil Remains Firm <a href="#e87" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c87" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">87</a></h3>
<p>The rice market is firm, with little change in prices across the board, but the arrival of goods is increasingly reduced, mainly due to high prices in the production areas, resulting in insufficient stocks in Shanghai. Yesterday, the total arrival of goods in the North and South markets was only 967 shi, and the market supply has also become even scarcer. Premium japonica rice has buyers but no sellers, with slight activity in medium and lower-grade rice. The supply of indica rice has also decreased, with only milled indica rice having some transactions, while other varieties are only subject to inquiry.</p>
<p>Flour</p>
<p>Remains inactive, with factories only able to ration sales to retailers due to the scarcity of raw wheat, and no longer able to supply the market. Retailers only receive 20 packages per day, which is not enough to meet retail demand.</p>
<p>Grains</p>
<p>Transactions are scarce, and supply is declining daily. Soybeans are in short supply, and the market is bullish. Corn is sold by few, with limited transactions according to restrictions. Buckwheat is selling well, red sorghum is still offered at 10 yuan, peas are actively sold to the north, broad beans have limited transactions, sesame is stable, and raw peanuts are slightly higher in price.</p>
<p>Edible Oil</p>
<p>Remains firm, with soybean oil supply still good, so price restrictions have not been imposed. Factories are also offering it at a slight increase of 0.20 yuan, to 49.20 yuan. Rapeseed oil is 46.20 yuan. Cooked rapeseed oil has risen 1.5 yuan due to lower arrivals. Pure raw oil remains at the original price, and small cart sesame oil is offered at a restricted price. Soybean cake remains at the restricted price of 4.60 yuan across the board.</p>
<h3 id="e88">Sugar Market Soft <a href="#e88" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c88" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">88</a></h3>
<p>The sugar market was firm yesterday, then weakened again. Because the Taiwan Sugar Corporation has already distributed its allocation, the industry has reached a saturation point. Retail sales on the street have also been slow, and selling pressure has increased in the market. The market sentiment is very weak, and the market lacks the strength to rise.</p>
<p>The 20th-period Taiwan Raw Sugar warehouse receipt opened at 24.80 yuan. As sales became sluggish and inventory registration was processed, holders rushed to sell, and the price gradually declined, reaching a low of 24.20 yuan at the close. Coarse sand and medium sand were down 0.50 or 0.60 yuan each. Numbers 4 and 5 refined white sugar lingered in a weak range for a long time and closed with a soft tone. Xinghua white sugar and Xinghua red sugar had no activity. Cotton white sugar from this factory and other brands also showed weakness.</p>
<h3 id="e89">Promising Outlook for the Tea Market <a href="#e89" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c89" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">89</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, domestic sales of red and green tea were more active than before. In addition to the continued steady demand from Suzhou and Wuxi, Yutai Tea Company and others on this street also added to their holdings in small quantities, so transactions gradually improved. As for the tea market for foreign companies, Qimen black tea, which is highly valued by England, has been officially traded in part after Concord and Jardine Matheson have been actively negotiating with the owners. However, most of them are mid-range goods, priced from 175 gold yuan to 205 gold yuan per dan. It is reported that Wing On Company is also interested in this variety. As for Tunlv Dabang and other varieties, sellers are reluctant to sell easily due to the scarcity of goods, and although exporters intend to purchase smoothly, it is difficult to fulfill their wishes.</p>

<p>[Report from this newspaper] As the deadline for exchanging gold, silver, and foreign currency approaches, citizens have been crowding to exchange them in recent days. The total value exchanged on the 27th reached over 24.9 million gold yuan, setting a new record for gold and silver exchange.</p>
<p>(1) Gold: 71,536.407 taels</p>

<h3 id="e91">Export Goods Market Overseas Remains Generally Firm <a href="#e91" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c91" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">91</a></h3>
<p>According to the Export Control Commission, the market for our export goods overseas this week (September 20th to 25th) remains generally firm, and major items are showing good performance. Unfortunately, domestic production area prices are higher, and transportation from production areas to ports is difficult, which contributes to the difficulty of procurement. The individual situations of the main export items are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Tung Oil: Production area quotations are stable, but arrivals are still low. The overseas market has slightly increased in price due to the implementation of export price limits. According to a telegram from the Bank of China in New York on September 23, tung oil in that area has reached US$0.21 per pound.</p>
<p>Bristles: Market conditions fluctuate. Domestic prices are greatly affected by purchases from non-industry people. The overseas market is performing well. According to a telegram from the Bank of China in New York on September 23, the US dollar prices per pound for various bristles are: Tianjin long bristles, asking price US$11, bid US$10; short bristles (2 inches), asking price US$6.55, bid US$6.45; 26-count bristles, asking price US$5.30, bid US$5.00; Dianqing bristles, asking price US$2.77, bid US$2.70; spotted bristles, asking price US$2.30, bid US$2.25. Exporters with inventory can complete transactions.</p>
<p>Tea: The market is selling steadily, prices in the production area are high, and arrivals are decreasing. Although exporters are eager to buy, their asking prices are too high, and foreign companies are holding back, making trading difficult. The overseas market is calm. Premium Qihong tea is US$0.25 per pound FOB Shanghai, and Tunlv tea is still US$0.30. Based on the current overseas market prices, exports will incur losses, but there is still overseas demand.</p>
<p>Raw Silk: Domestic and overseas market prices are roughly balanced. Grade D is still US$2.80 per pound FOB Shanghai. The production of fresh casings is increasing, and export volumes are still good. Based on current market prices, exports can still be transacted. The biggest difficulty for cement exports is the lack of packaging materials. The Council has already obtained approval from the Executive Yuan to import 1.5 million paper bags from overseas to meet the needs of major cement plants in the country. Cement exports are expected to expand in the future.</p>
<h3 id="e92">Export Control Commission Expresses Opinions on Promoting the Export of Goods <a href="#e92" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c92" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">92</a></h3>
<p>The Importers and Exporters Association recently submitted a request to the government to promote the export of goods, including: (1) Maintaining a reasonable price relationship between the production area and the distribution center for export prices; (2) Prohibiting non-industry people from manipulating export goods; (3) Improving the current state of export transportation; (4) Waiving confiscation of inventory that has not been purchased for over three months under contracts already signed with foreign companies. This reporter asked Chen Junren, director of the Export Promotion Office, about this matter. According to him, the Export Control Commission has already signed its opinions and submitted them to the Executive Yuan for improvement. (1) Maintaining a reasonable price relationship between the production area and the distribution center for export goods is related to national price control laws. However, for export goods that are not needed domestically, such as bristles, tung oil, and casings, the allowable limit for price increases will still be permitted if exports can still be profitable. In this way, merchants in the production area can sell, and exporters have export goods to purchase. Regarding this point, consultations are being made with the Economic Supervisory Office. (2) The Export Control Commission does not intend to suggest any rigid regulations to the authorities to prohibit non-industry people from manipulating export goods, but hopes that export associations will unite and organize closely, and the Export Control Commission will assist from the side. (3) The authorities have long been paying attention to improving export transportation. (4) Secretary Gao of the Supervisory Office stated that if exporters can present contracts signed with foreign companies that can prove the case, the goods can be exempted from confiscation.</p>

The price-limited locations include Shanghai, Hankou, Shashi, Xi'an, Ningbo, and the suburbs of Shanghai such as Zhoupu, Minhang, and Taicang. (2) The cotton prices discussed this time take into account the cost of the production area and the interests of farmers, so as not to affect the purchase volume. (3) There are two prerequisites for the success or failure of the Joint Purchase Office: (A) In addition to those participating in the joint purchase, those who want to go to various places to purchase their own goods must also abide by the price limit, and there must be no behavior such as raising prices or tampering with scales. Violators should be punished. (B) Local governments must strictly implement the price limit work.</p>

<p>Yesterday's cotton cloth market: in the morning, retail investors rushed to sell, and because the authorities have once again prohibited individual merchants from carrying cloth out of the country, the Fangjian Company's sales had an abundant supply. The initial price of 12-pound Longtou fine cloth fell by 0.50 yuan, and then gradually fell to 25.70 yuan. By the time it was about to close, transactions turned brisk, and the market rebounded suddenly, rising to 26.60 yuan, which was 0.20 yuan higher than the day before.

<p>Since the price limit was imposed on rayon, transactions have become lackluster. The silk weaving industry's needs are rationed by the China Trust Bureau, and the industry's sales are rationed by the association. There are no official transactions in the market. Familiar brands are still rare. Miscellaneous brands such as Snea and Xuetalong No. 120 have a small supply and are transacted according to the limit. The quantity is extremely small. Various brands have prices but no goods, and the market is very sluggish.</p>

<p>[Report from this newspaper in Nanjing, dated 28th] The Ministry of Education convened a symposium of university presidents from 3:00 PM to 7:00 PM on the 27th. Information on the issues discussed and studied at the meeting has been obtained from relevant parties: (1) Hu Shi's proposed plan to improve the allocation of school funds. The content explains that currently, 80% of all school funds are used for the salaries and meals of faculty and students, and only 20% are used for academic research and construction. It is hoped that the allocation ratio can be improved, with 60% used for salaries and meals and 40% used for research and construction. Before the war, faculty and student expenses accounted for 50%, and research and other expenses accounted for 50%. Mr. Yu, the writer, believes that this plan is reasonable and feasible, but in reality, the proportion of funds occupied by faculty and students is indispensable and necessary, so new sources of income must be opened up in order to achieve the goal of 40% for research and other expenses. (2) Regarding the review of professor qualifications, it is planned to formulate measures in the future to strive for simplification. (3) The review of students' school registration upon admission and the qualifications of graduates will also strive to simplify procedures. (4) Teaching and management planning issues were discussed, and opinions were exchanged to strengthen implementation.</p>

<h3 id="e102">National Secondary and Higher Education Institutions Part-Time Teaching Fee Payment Method: Professor Maximum of Eight Yuan Per Hour <a href="#e102" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c102" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">102</a></h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] The Ministry of Education's subordinate secondary and higher education institutions' teachers and staff part-time hourly fees are paid according to the local cost of living index standards. The method was previously revised and implemented on February 9, 1948, with Order No. 8094. Now, due to currency reform, starting from August 1948, all public education personnel salaries have been changed to be paid in Gold Yuan notes. All previous hourly fee payment standards are no longer applicable. The Ministry of Education has revised them according to the current public education personnel salary method, and it will be implemented starting from August 1948. The payment method for part-time hourly fees for teachers and staff of national secondary and higher education institutions is as follows: (1) If a school does not have enough teachers and must have its own teachers and staff take on part-time teaching duties, their part-time hourly fees will be paid according to the standards stipulated in this method. If the school has already hired enough teachers according to the approved quota, no one else may take on part-time teaching duties or receive part-time hourly fees. (2) Part-time hourly fee standards are as follows: (1) For colleges and universities, the maximum Gold Yuan notes per hour for a professor is eight yuan, for an associate professor is seven yuan, and for a lecturer is six yuan. (2) For secondary schools: the maximum Gold Yuan notes per hour for a senior high school teacher is five yuan, and for a junior high school teacher is four yuan. (3) For normal schools, vocational schools, and other training classes, the payment standard will be based on their nature and will be compared to the payment standards of schools at various levels. (3) Calculation method for hourly fee payment based on hours: Each semester is calculated as five months, each month is calculated as four weeks, and every four hours is calculated as one hour. (For example, in the "Fourth District" of the Beijing-Shanghai area, if a professor teaches part-time for four hours per week, the monthly part-time hourly fee will be 32 Gold Yuan. For professors teaching part-time in schools outside the "Fourth District" of the Beijing-Shanghai area, the part-time hourly fees will still be paid according to the approved zoning salary standards for August 1948, with the addition or reduction percentage for each zone. For example, if it is in the third zone, 45% should be added, which is 46 yuan and 40 cents. If it is in the fifth zone, 10% should be subtracted, which is 28 yuan and 80 cents.) (4) Part-time teaching is limited to four hours per week according to regulations. If a teacher or staff member of this school teaches part-time within four hours per week in addition to their required hours or duties, the part-time hourly fee will be paid according to the standard. Those who teach part-time at other schools for four hours or more may not teach part-time at this school again or receive this hourly fee. (5) These part-time teachers will be referred to as part-time professor, part-time associate professor, part-time lecturer, and part-time teacher, respectively. (6) Teachers' and staff's part-time fees should be paid and reimbursed within the school's salary budget and no special funds will be allocated. (7) This method will be implemented starting from August 1948.</p>

<h3 id="e114">Mr. Science and Mr. Democracy <a href="#e114" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c114" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">114</a></h3>
<p>— Jingwen</p>
<p>Based on sayings like "vast in territory and abundant in resources" and "long-standing culture," we do indeed have many things to boast about in terms of science and technology, such as the invention of the compass, papermaking, and gunpowder. Moreover, our ancestors were indeed very attentive to craftsmanship and technology. Sayings like "If a craftsman wishes to do his job well, he must first sharpen his tools" have already comprehensively explained that our ancestors deeply understood the philosophy of craftsmanship and technology. Furthermore, specialized books that recorded craftsmanship and technology, such as "The Artificers' Record" and "Exploitation of the Works of Nature," further prove the ancient people's emphasis on craftsmanship and technology.</p>
<p>However, looking around at our generation, in the field of craftsmanship and technology, we have clearly fallen behind terribly. People living in a large industrial city like Shanghai may not fully realize this phenomenon, because all the advanced products of world industry, such as airplanes, ships, automobiles, trains, various machines and their products, are all available in the city. For people who go out to take airplanes and sit in cars to go to the office, they rarely can comprehend the terrible backward position we are in in world craftsmanship and technology. And this generation happens to be our "national pillars and social cornerstones," wouldn't you say that's terrifying?</p>
<p>This is not to say that our country has absolutely no scientific and technological talents in recent years, we have plenty of talents. For example, Dr. Qian Sanqiang, who has recently given academic lectures in various parts of the country, has gained world renown for his academic contributions to atomic theory. There are also many talents in other specialized advanced technologies. However, the problem lies in the general and balanced development of craftsmanship and technology. Whether or not a country's national economy is strong is the key to a country's strength or weakness, which has long been an indisputable argument. Whether or not a national economy is strong must depend on a country's economic production capacity, which has also long been a settled argument. However, what determines a country's production capacity cannot rely on a few geniuses or a few experts. Geniuses are indeed exceptions, and experts are also national treasures, but the technical knowledge and production capacity of the majority of people is the determining point of a country's truly strong economy.</p>
<p>However, our shortcoming now lies precisely in this aspect. Even in the industrial city of Shanghai, which has a population of five million, the number of true industrial workers is probably not large, and the number of those who can automatically and carefully devote themselves to improving craftsmanship is even smaller. If we say that we are still an agricultural country, but now we have to rely partially on "relief rice" from industrial countries for survival, isn't that terribly sad? Although it's a long story, the fact that agricultural technology has not improved for thousands of years cannot be denied.</p>
<p>This problem is too big and involves too much. However, I personally have a feeling that the decline of national character has a great relationship with the inability to advance in craftsmanship and technology. For example, although we have not made much progress in scientific inventions and discoveries in recent centuries, we are quite good at using means such as stealing, trickery, and deception, such as counterfeiting, stealing labor and reducing materials, modeling, and alluding. For example, someone counterfeited a certain injectable medicine from a certain Swiss pharmaceutical factory. Although it was a counterfeit, it could not be detected in Shanghai, and it had to be sent to the Swiss factory to determine that it was a counterfeit. This shows that even though it is a counterfeit, it is quite clever. If they were willing to devote the energy spent on counterfeiting to research on inventions and discoveries, they would surely be able to achieve real gains. Now, abandoning this right path and not following it, it cannot be said that it is the result of the decline of national character.</p>
<p>In addition, the fact that our cultural route in recent centuries has been too focused on the abstract aspect of the spirit is also a major obstacle to the development of craftsmanship and technology. Although the empty-headed culture of the imperial examination era has become a thing of the past, the promotion of sound, light, electricity, and strong armor and sharp weapons at the end of the Qing Dynasty and the beginning of the Republic of China is still just empty talk. In the past, people ridiculed us as a "country of words," are we not still like this? Taking the issue of "Mr. Democracy" and "Mr. Science," the most lively thing in newspapers and magazines is still the issue of "Mr. Democracy." Perhaps some people believe that only after the issue of "Mr. Democracy" is resolved can we talk about "Mr. Science," but I always feel that this view is questionable. If there is no help from the strength of "Mr. Science," I am afraid that "Mr. Democracy" can only be lively on paper forever.</p>
<p>Since the War of Resistance against Japan, the call for increased production has been heard for a long time. However, without first increasing the production skills of the people, without awakening the people's ambition for craftsmanship and technology, these calls will become more and more empty. However, in today's society where a few people can become rich overnight by turning their hands over, is it still possible to encourage people's progress? This is indeed a big question. In this way, the issue of "Mr. Democracy" is indeed more important than "Mr. Science." However, I believe that only when these two gentlemen join hands and advance together can the issue be truly resolved. Now, at least everyone has a concept about the issue of "Mr. Democracy," which is indeed a gratifying phenomenon; what is hoped is that the public will not be too indifferent to "Mr. Science," because the final master in the future must be this gentleman.</p>

<h3 id="e117">Drive-In Theaters <a href="#e117" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c117" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">117</a></h3>
<p>— Mao Yi</p>
<p>Every summer night, about 825,000 Americans sit in their cars watching movies. These open-air cinemas where audiences sit in their own cars, Americans call them Drivin (tentatively translated as "drive-in theaters"). These theaters were initially just crude lots that could squeeze in a hundred or so cars, with loudspeakers blaring noise. Now, they have been improved to accommodate 700 to 1,000 cars, with specially built inclined ramps for cars, directly facing the silver screen, and two separately controlled in-car talking machines.</p>
<p>New-style "drive-in theaters" have amusement parks, pinball arcades, and picnic tables. One "drive-in theater" near Covington, Kentucky, in addition to showing movies, also provides the following free entertainment for the audience: watching fireworks, horseback riding, and boating.</p>
<p>Children under twelve are admitted free, so in many "drive-in theaters" you can see that except for one adult driving, the entire car is filled with children. However, the theater owners don't care. They want people to know the benefits of patronizing "drive-in theaters." Here, the audience can smoke, chat, or eat popcorn without disturbing those around them. There is no parking problem, and no need to dress up neatly in the hot weather. Obese and disabled people who find it inconvenient to go to indoor theaters flock to "drive-in theaters."</p>
<p>"Drive-in theaters" have been around for fifteen years, but their development has been most vigorous in the past year. The founder was a young chemical manufacturer named Richard M. Hollingshead Jr. from Camden, New Jersey. In May 1933, he organized a company, with the financial support of his cousin, and built the world's first "drive-in theater" near his hometown, which could accommodate 500 cars. Although the equipment seems simple today, at the time it was a very comfortable way to watch movies.</p>
<p>Other engineers followed suit, and by the time the United States entered the war, there were 52 "drive-in theaters," with another 62 under construction or planned. Although film companies only supplied them with some old movies at the time, the operators still earned a total of three million yuan each year.</p>
<p>Wartime gasoline rationing almost strangled "drive-in theaters," but by mid-1946, they were active again. Now there are 546 "drive-in theaters" across the United States, accommodating approximately 275,000 cars. Their annual net profit is estimated to be about 28 million yuan. At the current rate of construction, by 1950, the United States will have more than 1,000 "drive-in theaters."</p>
<p>"Drive-in theaters" are becoming more and more considerate of their audience's needs. One offers free warming of baby bottles. Several have dog kennels, providing free services for audiences who bring dogs. And one is the most thoughtful: housewives who go to the theater to watch a movie can leave their laundry in a special shed. When they come out after watching the movie, the theater has already washed and dried the items and returns them – but this service requires an additional charge.</p>
<h3 id="e118">Peeking into the Bridal Chamber <a href="#e118" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c118" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">118</a></h3>
<p>— Yi Yun</p>
<p>I have already recorded the story of students from a certain school catching thieves in the Ben Tan section of the newspaper on the 26th. Now I will record another interesting incident involving those same students. One day, a student got married, and there was the custom of "peeking into the bridal chamber" (that is, at night, secretly going to the bridal chamber to eavesdrop, learning all the words and deeds of the newly married couple, and then announcing it to the public the next morning for laughter and to demand candy). The students, being young and fond of mischief, naturally enjoyed it. That evening, they groped in the dark, took off their shoes, and sneaked over, so as not to be heard by the newlyweds. However, as they approached the window of the bridal chamber, they felt that every step had fine sand, touching the soles of their socks and making a squeaking sound. They brushed it away with their hands, but it was there again when they stepped down. After eavesdropping for a long time, they only saw the groom circling the room. Later he went behind the bed, and only came out after a long while. However, he was hidden by the bed curtains, so they didn't know what he was doing. Soon after, the groom took off his clothes and got into bed, while the bride had already leaned lazily on the sofa, and each fell into a sound sleep. They waited until almost dawn, gaining nothing. Moreover, hungry mosquitoes were biting their skin, and they could no longer wait, so they went back together. Unexpectedly, when descending the stairs to the landing, one foot suddenly stepped into water, deep enough to submerge the shin. Only then did they realize that they had been tricked. Someone had placed a basin of water there early on. The first to step into the icy water did not make a sound, fearing that those behind would become aware and turn around to laugh at them. The next person also stepped into the water and still did not speak. The last person jumped down with both feet, fully entering the water. They rushed back to the dormitory, but unexpectedly the door was already locked from the inside, and they could not get in. So they sat together in the courtyard. The night was cool and piercing to the skin, and their socks and pants were wet, making them extremely cold and shivering. The mosquitoes were also biting them, and they could not bear the fatigue. At dawn, they looked at each other and suddenly realized that they were all black, mottled like ghosts, and looked extremely ridiculous. Only then did they realize that the fine sand in front of the window was coal dust secretly spread by the groom, and that they had brushed their socks with their hands and slapped mosquitoes on their faces, and then scratched them, resulting in this. And the water basin at the bottom of the stairs was also placed by the groom, who had secretly slipped out through the door behind the bed to do it. The students were hidden by the curtains and could not see his trick. This groom was extremely cunning.</p>
<h3 id="e119">Simplicity <a href="#e119" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c119" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">119</a></h3>
<p>— Qian Dacheng</p>
<p>Ever since Zhuge Wuhou (also known as Zhuge Liang), Marquis Wu, proposed the two sentences in his "Admonition to His Son" - "Without simplicity, there is no way to clarify one's ambitions," and "Without tranquility, there is no way to achieve far-reaching goals," many people have regarded "simplicity" as the highest realm of human cultivation. Yan Jidao (Yan Fu) even said that the meaning of these two sentences of Marquis Wu was derived from Laozi. This further showed that simplicity is invaluable. The "pure-hearted person" mentioned by Tao Yuanming is actually a person who is simple and does nothing.</p>
<p>"Simplicity" is indeed rare. Being able to view wealth and status as floating clouds and pursue what one loves in life is truly the so-called pure happiness. But at the same time, some people are loudly calling out: "Can one not be wealthy and noble in life?" Knowing that "wealth and status are like dew on the grass," but life is like grass and trees. Without a little moisture from sweet dew, it will wither and languish to death. In years of war and chaos, it is more difficult to obtain the minimum enjoyment than it is to obtain high office and generous salary in times of peace and prosperity. Therefore, Gong Ding'an (Gong Zizhen) had to say: "Talented men in middle age indulge in silk and bamboo, and hermits in lean years despise fine silk gauze. Both feelings are understandable, and autumn pens should not overly criticize them."</p>
<p>To talk about "simplicity" in times of chaos is actually a high-sounding tune shouted out in desperation to relieve ridicule from the pressure of life. If "simplicity" cannot lead to "tranquility," how can it "clarify one's ambitions" or "achieve far-reaching goals"? People who are truly capable of simplicity will never shout out the words "simplicity" from their mouths. - I feel that Fan Bozi (Fan Zhongyan) was more straightforward when he said: "Knowing early on that simplicity breeds烦恼 (fánnǎo, worries), why did I not simply indulge in madness at the time." Even if you can endure hardship willingly, how can you bear the pain of "family members all reproaching me"? Therefore, some people are saying: "Being a clean official is doable but not doable, while being a corrupt official is undoable but doable."</p>
<p>I am not looking down on "simplicity," but instead of just shouting "simplicity" in vain, it is better to grit your teeth and endure it with relish.</p>
<h3 id="e120">Gold and National Fortune <a href="#e120" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c120" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">120</a></h3>
<p>— Zhu Zhenjiang</p>
<p>According to reports, the gold reserve for the issuance of the gold yuan currency in China today is 2,767,103,587 ounces (Editor's note: This number is based on the Central News Agency report after the issuance of the gold yuan currency, and all newspapers recorded the same number. However, in fact, there must be an error. Even considering that the issuance amount of the gold yuan currency is only 2 billion, in fact, such a gold reserve is not needed). The silver reserve is 41.37 million ounces. This is the amount of gold and silver owned by the national treasury, while the amount of gold and silver hidden among the people is like the weight of a tripod, which cannot be asked about. However, we see that the amount of gold recorded in history books in China is more in ancient times and less now, cheaper in ancient times and more expensive now. This can be observed from the jin and liang (traditional Chinese units of weight). In the past, when Su Qin persuaded the King of Zhao, the King of Zhao bestowed 10,000 yi of gold. The annotation in the Book of Han says: In the Qin dynasty, one yi was one jin, and in the Han dynasty, one jin was one jin of gold. When Chen Ping persuaded the King of Han, the King of Han gave him 40,000 jin of gold and allowed Ping to do whatever he wanted, without asking about income and expenditure. Some say 100,000 jin, as seen in Zhu Xuan's Collected Records. When the King of Liang Xiao died, the treasury had a surplus of more than 400,000 jin of gold. When Wang Mang died, 60 cabinets, each containing 10,000 jin of gold, were found in the province. When Dong Zhuo died, there were 30,000 jin of gold in the Wubao. In addition, the cases of rewarding with gold were also numerous. Emperor Wu bestowed 100 jin of gold to Dongfang Shuo. He also rewarded the soldiers who followed Wei Qing in expeditions to the frontier with as much as 200,000 jin. Emperor Xuan bestowed a total of 7,000 jin of gold to Huo Guang. Emperor Xiaowen of Wei bestowed 8,000 jin of gold to Bao Dudu for his funeral.</p>
<p>As for the Six Dynasties, silver was still measured in jin, while gold was measured in liang. Emperor Wen of Sui bestowed 150 liang of gold and 150 jin of silver to Zhou Fashang. This is the only known case where jin and liang were mentioned together. Zhao Yi Kao said that the practice of measuring in liang started in the Liang dynasty. When Emperor Jing of Han surrounded the city, Yang Kan led troops to defend it, and the emperor ordered the delivery of 5,000 liang of gold and 10,000 liang of silver to reward the generals and soldiers. After that, it was generally referred to as liang. Chen Zhouluo was rewarded with 3,000 liang of gold and silver each for his merit in breaking the siege of Pengcheng. Sui Liangyan was rewarded with 3,000 liang of gold for his merit in pacifying Jiannan. Lai Huer was rewarded with 1,000 liang of gold for defeating Yang Yuanyuan. From this, it can be seen that the practice of measuring gold and silver in liang had already started in the Northern and Southern Dynasties.</p>
<p>During the Song dynasty, the country was weak and the people were poor, and the amount of gold decreased significantly. In the Biography of Du Hao in the History of the Song Dynasty, Emperor Taizong asked why the bestowals in the Western Han dynasty were all in gold, but gold had become a rare commodity in modern times. Hao replied: At that time, Buddhism was not yet flourishing, so gold was cheap. In fact, Emperors Huizong and Qinzong still offered 200,000 liang of gold and 2,000,000 liang of silver to the Jin dynasty to beg for peace. But comparing liang with jin, it is not known how many times less it was. Now it is used to beg for peace, so it cannot be compared with bestowals. Because one comes from natural bestowal, with surplus resources at hand, while the other is done out of necessity, and one cannot but seek it forcefully.</p>
<p>During the Ming dynasty, the central government was昏庸 (hūnyōng, muddled and incompetent), and eunuchs seized power, privately seizing gold and silver, and their collections were extremely rich. The Small Record of Knowledge records that in the Zhengde reign, when Liu Ying's family was confiscated, there were 12,507,800 liang of gold and 25,958,360 liang of silver. The Seven Cultivation Categories also says that during the Zhengde reign of the Ming dynasty, there was the eunuch Liu Jin before and the commander Zhou Ning after, both of whom had sole control of power. When their family properties were confiscated, Liu Jin had 240,000 ingots and 57,800 liang of gold, and 5 million ingots of silver, etc. And the amount of gold stored in the national treasury at that time was also not small.</p>
<p>During the Qing dynasty, the amount of gold and silver confiscated from He Shen's family was negligible compared to that of Liu Ying. It was only over 26,800 liang of gold hidden in the walls. This is about the same as the amount secretly hidden by the great traitor Yan Song in the Song dynasty. The Record of Ice Mountain in the Sky satirized Yan Song's downfall, when his family was confiscated, there were only 30,000 liang of gold and over 3 million liang of silver. Perhaps he deposited a larger amount in the inner and outer treasuries, which was even more than Liu Jin and Zhu Chong (the Small Record of Knowledge records that Zhu Chong's family had 50 million liang of silver). After all, the power and cunning of traitors far surpassed that of eunuchs.</p>
<p>In summary, from the dynamics and numbers of gold, we can see the strength or weakness of the national power. And from the bestowal, acceptance, and storage, we can also get a glimpse of the rise and fall of the national fortune.</p>
