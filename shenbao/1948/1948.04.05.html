<h3>王外長發表聲明　政府接受美援心情沉重　不避困難推行民主憲政</h3>
<p>〔本報南京四日電〕美國援華案，業由杜魯門總統於四月三日簽署，我外交部長王世杰特於四日發表下列聲明：</p>
<p>美國援華案，業田美國國會通過，幷經美國總統簽署，中國政府與人民聞之欣感，此爲美國對華友誼之又一表現，並且是美國對中國嚴重局勢之一種認識。</p>
<p>此案各項條款，尙待兩國政府以合作精神付諸實施，本人此時所欲鄭重申述者，爲此案之通過，可能給予中國人民以重大的精神鼓勵，此案的影響，非單就款額之數字所能估計。</p>
<p>但中國政府接受此案，其心情實十分沉重，因為此案之成功或失敗，吾人勢將負最後之責任。中國今日實面臨多種困難，當此共黨公然作亂，通貨惡性膨脹之際，其他國家如遭遇相似情形，或將採取別種政治途徑，但吾人則決心於此時推行民主憲政，此項政治計劃與夫張院長所曾宣布的十項經濟自助方案，中國政府將必以極大之決心與毅力，使之實現。蓋此爲到達中國統一及建設之道路，亦即保全整個遠東和平與安全之途徑，只要吾人循此目標邁進，吾人的努力，決不會是孤單的，此爲予所深信不疑者也。</p>

<h3>社論　美國援外法案簽署之後</h3>
<p>美國援外法案經參衆兩院聯席會議通過後，不到廿四小時，即由杜魯門總統簽署成爲法律，並將由國務院於卅六小時以內開始執行。民主國家的行動能如此迅速，誠爲美國承平時代所僅見；而且翻閱其內容，美國援外的總額爲六十億九千八百萬美元，用以援助歐亞兩洲的國家抵抗共產勢力的侵入與擴張；其中並包括美國在經濟上軍事上援助中國的四億六千三百萬美元。所以這個援外法案是美國戰時租借法案以來最偉大的對外援助，適在美蘇從事冷戰至白熱化的時候簽署成立，格外覺得其意義重大，誠如杜魯門總統在簽署時所說：『此項援外法案，實爲美國對於今日自由世界所面臨的挑　的一種答覆。」惟杜魯門總統仍一再說明：「美國採取此項措置，在求世界的復興，安定，與和平，故此法案之目的，乃在協助他國保持一種條件，使自由制度得以存在。美國人民爲締造世界和平而努力，具有絕大決心，亦可於此獲一明證。』同時在哥倫比亞京城出席泛美會議的馬歇爾國務卿，接獲杜魯門總統簽署援外法案的消息，亦欣然曰：『此項法案的簽署，在美國外交政策上，實爲具有歷史性的一個步驟。』</p>
<p>美國大規模援外的計劃，是馬歇爾國務卿於去年六月十五日在哈佛大學演說首先提出的。這一個問題不論在美國的輿論界或在參衆兩院，均曾引起激烈的爭辯，所謂智者見智仁者見仁，各方面的意見殊不一致；至去年十一月間杜魯門總統鑒於國際危機日深，乃召集國會舉行特別會議，始通過一項五億九千七百萬美元的緊急援外法案；至於杜魯門總統所提出的長期援歐法案，一直討論至今天，才算獲得一個具體的結論，長期援外的計劃才能開始執行；這一個發展的　程，使世人對於民主國家行動的遲緩，無不表示焦慮；但是這一次看到杜魯門總統行動的迅速，却又不能不表示樂觀了。誠如杜魯門總統所謂：『援外法的通過，含有一重大的意義，就是兩黨一致的政策，能使吾人採取有效的行動；同時亦可證明，爲和平而採取迅速有效的行動，與吾人進行民主的討論，並不牴觸』。所以杜魯門總統這次迅遠簽署援外法案，使我們發生下列幾項感想：</p>
<p>第一，美國政府對於當前的國際危機，現已特別提高警覺了。最近捷克民主悲劇的接連演出，不僅使美國的人民深感共產勢力的威脅，而且使杜魯門總統對於世界和平的信心也發生動搖，因此美國不得不急起直追，以挽回世界的狂瀾於未倒。放眼看歐洲，西歐五國聯盟雖已成立，可是勢單力薄，實不足以與東歐集團相對抗，美國若不立即予以經濟的援助，西歐聯盟更無意義可言，尤其是義大利，蘇聯對於義國的野心，昭然若揭，路人皆知，而四月十八日的普選，轉　將屆，只見義共的活躍，美國若仍袖手旁觀，則義共的獲勝，可操左券；果爾，則蘇聯的鐵幕將由東歐移至大西洋地中海，到那時始予以援助，還有什麼意義可言！同時在亞洲，也有同樣危急的情形。中國是反共的急先鋒，刻正與其有國際背景的共匪作戰。從大體看來，亞洲的形勢雖勝歐洲一籌，但美國若不立即在經濟上軍事上援助中國，則亞洲亦將步歐洲的後塵，使蘇聯在亞洲也處於堅不可拔的地位。所以不論在歐洲或在亞洲，均迫切需要　　的援助，美國政府的行動所以能如此迅速，其原因也就　此。因此我們展望將來，美國爲對付蘇聯的冷戰起見，必能隨時採取迅連有效的行動，以制止蘇聯繼續擴張其勢力，不再像從前着着落後；但是在蘇聯方面，勢必也要加緊努力，從中破壇美國的援外計劃。這也是可以斷言的。所以我們預料，今後美蘇鬥爭，必將益演益烈。</p>
<p>第二，美國對於維持世界和平負有特別責任，現已開始負起道　　荷來了。她覺得歐亞兩洲都非常危險，便予以輕濟上的援助，但是從這個法案的立法精神看來，美國援外的重點，却仍偏在歐洲，他們至今仍認爲歐洲的危機最深刻，默洲與美國的口係最密切，援助歐洲國家容易奏效，所以美國畀予歐洲各國的援助，在數量上比較鉅大；在時間上，享受優先　權利。我們觀　世界大局，固然不能太主觀，但是我們終認為美國採取「歐洲第一」的政策，是一種可怕的偏見，足以鑄成歷史的錯誤，使美國在遠東的地位也陷於不可挽救的困境。所以我們仍希望美國的外交當局對於遠東形勢，能放大眼光，加以觀察，以洞悉其利害關係，作為進行經濟軍事援華的準繩。</p>
<p>第三，美國的援華，不論在數量上時間上，仍嫌不足，能吾達國「促成中國和平及經濟穩定」的目的，實在是一個極嚴重的問題；但是國家生存於現行國際社會中，貴在自立，千萬不能稍存依賴他國的幻想。今日之中國，因爲物質的困難，若欲復興建國，不得不需要外國的援助，但是我們不能把一切希望都寄托在外國的援助上，而最重要的還是自力更生。現在美國旣已開始在經濟上軍事上援助中國，我國當前唯一的課題，自爲如何使美援有效！所謂「天助自助」，唯有如此，始能使美國大量援助源源而來！這是要全國朝野深切反省的。</p>

<h3>啓事</h3>
<p>今日因廣吿　擠，科學週刋與自由談暫停一日。</p>
<p>編輯部啓</p>
<h3>新聞自由會議　一個精彩的序幕　張彭春博士舌戰格穆洛夫</h3>
<p>〔本報日內瓦三月甘五日航訊〕冬天悄悄地離開了阿爾卑斯山，聯合國新聞自由會議，給日內瓦湖上，帶來了無限春意。藍色的湖水，倒映着聳立在湖岸的『國聯大厦』，一抹乳白色建築，在陽光中閃爍着萬道光芒。這座曾經化十年心血與雨百萬美金締造的『和平之宮』，在第二次世界大戰以前，一度像曇花一樣出現過各國的『和平使者』。如今，時過境遷，變成了咱們新聞記者的折衝之所。</p>
<p>廿七票對六票擊敗蘇方動議</p>
<p>鮑格穆洛夫是蘇俄的駐法大使，一個半禿，魁梧而有丰韻儀表的外交官。他和前任的蘇俄駐華大使同姓，但沒有絲毫親屬關係。去年初冬，聯合國的人權委員會在日內瓦開會，蘇俄方面也是這位鮑格穆洛夫首席，和羅斯　總統夫人開　論戰。這次聯合國新聞自由會義，又是飽格程洛夫放的第一砲，他要聯合國的　會員國，而被　請來參加新聞白由會議的，如羅馬尼亞，保加利亞等國，都有表決　及　　　，鮑格穆洛夫的提案，是在選舉人會的主席以前，中國首席代表張彭春博士，主張按照程序選舉主席，無須插入意外枝節問題，所謂『按照旣定程序』，便是根據社會經濟理事會的原來意思，被邀請出席之非UNC會員國，有發言權，但無表決權，一塲舌戰以後，中國以二十七票對六票，擊敗了蘇俄的臨時動議。</p>
<p>三次精彩辯論　屬純外交問題</p>
<p>單祗開會第一天、張彭春和鮑格穆洛夫對碰了三次，三次都是極精彩的　論，但都屬於純外交問題。與新聞自由本身，很少直接關係。第一次是選舉大會主席，以前非會員國代表團的選舉　問題。第二次是大會主席　出以後，鮑格穆洛夫再度提出的非會員國表決權問題，那次蘇俄方面的陣容，來勢甚猛，首先是鮑格穆洛夫演講，接著是保加利亞的代表演講，一位捲髮溫文的年靑人，他穿一身靑色西裝，講話時不時搖動他的長髮，興奮的時候，而自拿鉛筆桿擊拍著桌子，他說：「聯合國邀我們來參加，當然要我們參加討論，旣要我們參加討論，那就彼此視同兄弟之邦，何以又要分成會員國與非會員國？劃出一道鴻溝？如果大家認爲我們不配有表決權，那我們乾脆就捲舖蓋回家去好了！」</p>
<p>繞了個大圈子　英代表說真意</p>
<p>這位典型的斯拉夫靑年，似乎有一股可佩的熱忱，當他剛舉手要講話的時候，主席台上的羅麥魯主席，因爲從來沒有在任何國際塲中見過他，羅麥魯大聲地問坐在左右兩旁的秘書：「他是誰？」後來查對各國席次表，才知道他是保加利亞的代表。</p>
<p>英國的麥克男臣，講話最婉轉，也最認眞，麥克男是這回英國代表團的首席，他反對蘇俄的提議，但開頭十分鐘，幾乎盡是講　轉恭　的話，繞了十八個大圈子，最後才說出英國代表團的眞意：一應該　照社會經濟理事會的意思，非會員國祇有發言權，決有表決權！」</p>
<p>法比首席代表　主開放表決權</p>
<p>法國和比利時是贊成開放表決權的，他們認爲聯合國組織應該開放，使聯合國的基礎日漸擴大，不知有任何門戶之見的約束。比利時的代表講話，口齒非常淸楚，像大學敎授講定律或公式一樣，博得許多東歐國家的掌聲。</p>
<p>最妙的是阿爾巴尼亞和希臘的代表，阿爾巴尼亞的首席代表，一口啞嗓子，像剛纔傷了風一樣，最初是用右手撐住腦袋，繼而乾脆把上半身都挨在講壇上他背誦了許多阿爾巴尼亞「抗戰」的功動，然後說到阿爾巴尼亞有多少人口，多少土地，爲什麼沒有表決權？他還說：阿爾巴尼亞愛好和平，雖非『會員國』，但很久以前，即有加入聯合國的傾向。這次阿爾巴尼亞旣被應邀來參加「新聞自由」的討論，當然應該享有表決權。</p>
<p>希臘代表站起來痛斥阿爾巴尼亞和保加利亞，指責他們對希臘的侵略行爲，『替人相見，分外眼紅』。這位好　關羽一樣的紅頭紅面的希臘首席代表，講了一大　離開『新聞自由』十萬八千里的宏論，最後說：「我　議美國英國和中國的意見，非會員國沒有表決權！」</p>
<p>抓住別人漏洞　贏得許多掌聲</p>
<p>張彭春在第一天的上下午大會裏，無疑是表現最精彩的一個，他的流利的英語和機敏的思維，使他辯論得井井有理，他抓住保加利亞代表的一個漏洞，然後翻來覆去强調對方理論上的缺點，贏得許多堂聲。有位英國同業翹起大姆指對我說：「他是一位大辯論家！」另外一位美國同業說：「張彭春的口才眞是好極，就是太嫌戲劇化一點！」</p>
<p>張彭春在第一天不僅講得好，而且也講得多，他和俄國代表團的第三次辯論，是爲了「外蒙古問題』。蘇俄代表於議程中途，忽然來了一長篇的「外蒙古一覽」，報吿外蒙古自一九二一年「人民革命」以後，開了多少學校，辦了多少工廠，造了多少戲院，出版了多少書報。並稱：「不准外蒙古派代表出席新聞自由會議是不應該的」，因此，俄國提議補請外蒙古列席大會。</p>
<p>外蒙列席問題　又被打擊下去</p>
<p>這個意外的難題，還是給張彭春『頂』了回去。美國首席代表威廉倍頓焦急地說：「我們還是要多用時間討論新聞自由呢？還是這樣節外生枝的辯論下去？」他大聲疾呼：「不要多化時間去竄改議事程序及議事規則。」這意思和中國代表團的大致一樣。威廉倍頓過去做過美國助理國務卿，憑他的豐富經驗，自然講得非常得體。</p>
<p>國際會議不外乎辯論，任何有關外交的爭執，總是兩條陣綫分得非常明顯，新聞自由會議的開始，也沒有半點例外。（於斯屈拉斯　飯店）</p>

<p>〔聯合社柏林四日電〕蘇聯今日正式照會美軍當局，願就蘇軍佔領區交通管制問題進行談判，藉以澄清目前局勢。是爲蘇聯自三月二十。退出盟國對德管制委員會以來願與美方重新談判之初次舉動，蘇聯是否已向英法兩國提出同樣照會，現尙未悉。據美軍政府宣稱，蘇聯照會內雖重申原來立塲，但對若干管制細節表示願意談判，日期則未提及。</p>
<p>〔路透社海爾福三日電〕英參謀總長蒙哥馬利元帥乘專機於今日抵德境英軍區之梅萊城，將先與英軍總司令羅勃森中將一談，並召集萊茵區英陸軍高級參謀舉行秘密會議，然後於星期二赴柏林。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社倫敦四日電〕英國雷諾新聞四日載稱：蘇駐德陸軍總司令索柯洛夫基業已接受英軍總司令羅勃森之請柬，參加下週二羅勃森將軍為東道之宴會。又稱，預料蒙帥亦將參加此宴會。</p>
<p>〔聯合社柏林四日電〕蘇聯今晨一時十分接受美方要求，並飭令其武裝衛兵八名退出柏林美軍佔區域鐵路總局大廈後五小時，包圍大廈之美憲兵約五十人亦開始撤退。美方昨夜要求蘇聯撤退衛兵之照會會謂，蘇兵出現於美軍佔區係屬違反轄權規定，如有武裝保護必要，應由美軍自行辦理。眾信包圍鐵路總局事件，不過柏林美軍當局之一種姿態，旨在答復蘇聯之交通管制命令。</p>
<h3>柏林鐵路交通漸入常軌　美空運工作停止　蘇戰鬥機群黑夜舉行演習</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕紐約四日廣播：弗朗克福訊，歐洲美空軍司令部宣佈，一俟弗朗克福機塲上準備運赴柏林之貨物運竣後，即將停止空運。此點顯示通往柏林之鐵路交通已漸入常軌，柏林美佔區之糧食供應，不致匱乏矣。</p>
<p>又訊，空運工作已於今夜停止。</p>
<p>〔路透社柏林三日電〕武裝美軍今日已在柏林通至波茨坦之要道口，設置障碍物以爲「報復」，蘇軍駐德總司令索柯洛夫斯基固即居住波茨坦。柏林蘇聯已通至美國區之其他道路口亦均有美軍駐守，檢查往來行人。英運煤火車二列美供應車一列，已安全抵柏林。蘇方之干涉似僅以盟國方面之載客列車爲限，空運及公路交通均正常往來如恒。</p>
<p>惟蘇當局業已通知美軍政府，謂將有異常大批蘇聯戰鬥機於昨夜從事演習，三日夜當繼續演習，此項通知已轉知使用至柏林空中走廊之英美法機認駛員。英美方面人士預料蘇方不久或將進一步干涉空中交通，然英軍政府發言人則曰蘇戰鬥機之夜間大批出動，不足爲異，蓋此固蘇軍春季大操之一部份而已。</p>
<h3>大戰文獻　蘇外部發表　揭發英姑息政策</h3>
<p>〔中央社莫斯科三日電〕蘇外交部發表之大戰文獻筆一卷「世界第二次大戰前夕之文件」，本日開始發售。其中包括前德外部一九三七年十一月至一九三八年十二月止檔卷。此乃歐洲外交史上最爲黑暗之時期。其中四十四件，明白顯示英國不惜一切犧牲，以姑息希時勒之外交政策，其始爲哈里法克斯勛爵（英前外相）及漢德森（英前駐德大使與希特勒之會談紀録）表明張伯倫（英前首相）與希特勒合作之初衷。關於捷克危機之全部，文件表明英國欺騙捷政府之行動。文件之結局波蘭駐英大使之函件，體明張伯倫因其永無休止之姑息政策，以致聲望日减。另一文件則為英駐捷大使與捷外畏之會談紀錄，顯示英國於慕尼黑協定之後，不願再保證捷克之獨立。</p>
<h3>實施援歐方案　法義表歡迎</h3>
<p>法共正擬具對抗計劃</p>
<p>〔路透社巴黎三日電〕許曼總理歡迎杜魯門總統之簽准援外法案，表示「罵歇爾方案，將以大量物資供給歐洲，乃歐洲經濟復興之主要因素，亦爲社會及政治安定之基本助力，受惠諸國尤其是法國，將決不如妄稱該方案爲戰爭工具者所欺」。財政部長梅逸表示：「當杜魯門總統簽字於該法案時，余及自由世界全體公民，莫不認識此一分鐘的重要性。吾人當以吾人之努力復興，重建殘破社會，答覆美國之雅意」</p>
<p>〔路透社巴黎三日電〕法全國共產黨人七千餘人，已於本週末雲集巴黎，以擬具對抗罵歇爾方案之計劃。彼等乃三年前依法所設聯合經理委員會之工會代表。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社羅馬三日電〕義總理加斯貝利致電美國務卿馬歇爾，盛譽罵歇爾爲歐洲復興計劃之「推動人」｛電稱：對根據和平與人類同胞愛之原則，創議歐洲復與計劃，貴國政府復對此計劃給予偉大之貢獻，使自由義大利獲有國際合作之機會，余特向君表示無上之敬意。</p>
<h3>蘇聯大使抵土履新</h3>
<p>〔中央社安加拉三日電〕蘇駐土新大使拉伐里契夫今日抵此，一九四六年蘇士關係惡化以來，蘇聯僅有代辦駐土。政界人士正注意新大使之活動。</p>
<h3>蘇芬談判陷停頓　軍事條欵荷蘭堅不讓步　芬兩代表將攜新訓令返莫斯科</h3>
<p>〔聯合社分蘭京城三日電〕芬蘭內閣今日決定對蘇聯要求統結安全條約之最後答覆，即將由芬蘭兩代表携往莫斯科。負賣人士稱，芬總統巴錫基維原擬同意萬一蘇聯遭遇直接攻擊時，芬蘭當保衛其自身邊境，但芬蘭應有權決定此種攻擊威脅之時間及對蘇軍事合作應何時開始。新訓令是否本向樣方針，尙不可知。</p>
<p>〔路透社海爾辛基四日電〕芝加哥每日論壇報記者稱：極端可靠方面透露，蘇芬互助條約談判在莫斯科舉行之情形如下：開會之初，莫洛托夫外長即詢問芬代表團可否以蘇匈·蘇捷·蘇羅條約爲藍本。芬總理貝卡拉致答辭，强調芬蘭保守中立之志願。莫洛托夫促芬蘭提出建議。貝卡拉表示建議之可能性甚多，表示希望蘇聯能尊重芬蘭之特別環境。渠聲明芬代表團僅獲有僅在戰時並在芬蘭領土內適用之條約。次日芬代表團乃提出條約草案，其中包括下列諸點：（一）若德國或其盟邦攻擊芬蘭，芬蘭將以全力抵抗侵略，如本身方量不够，將於成立相互協定後由蘇聯供給援助。（二）蘇聯非經特別請朮，不得進入芬蘭行使互助權。據悉，巴錫基維總統於芬代表團啓程前，即明示須經芬蘭請求，蘇聯始能援助。渠並囑芬代表團堅持雙方之必須支持促進和平之措施及聯合國機構，任何一方且不得締結針對對方之明約，雙方應在文化及經濟方而合作，雙方不得千涉彼此之內政。蘇聯原要求條約有效期爲二十年，巴錫基維則堅持至多十年。談判時此點不能解決，已暫時擱置。三月廿七日貝卡拉總理向蘇方提出廣泛聲明，聲言芬蘭決以本國陸海空軍抵抗侵略，軍事條款祗適用於戰爭時期，如果採取軍事合作，雙方應互尊主權。莫洛托夫召隻蘇代表團會議一小時後，聲明蘇聯可以接受芬建議，作爲討論基礎。然後莫洛托夫建議修改軍事部份建議，俾擴大其適用範圍。巴錫基維自莫斯科接獲此等情報後，今正在草　對芬代表團之新指令。芬軍事顧問已向總統指出莫洛托夫建議之修改，將引起廣泛的措辭，而易有武斷的解釋，例如些微事件，看炸彈一枚落於芬蘭領水外圍之小島等，即足爲紅軍開入芬蘭以費「互防」之藉口，在現階段之談判中，至少有社會民主黨閣員四人，農民黨閣員一人，反對對蘇軍事讓步，國會多數議員亦持風一意見。</p>
<h3>防共黨攫奪政權　美軍警耀武遊行</h3>

<h3>馬卿與智利代表會商　西半球防共方案　準備即向泛美會議提出</h3>
<p>〔合眾社波哥大西日電〕美國務卿馬歇爾四日秘密會晤智利之首席代表漢那柴達，計劃加強美國對蘇聯作冷戰之戰略。馬氏及漢氏兩人乃第九屆泛美會議中反共行動之領導代表。馬歇爾後透露稱：渠曾與漢氏討論應以何種式樣之反共決議向泛美會議提出，馬歇爾三日與其他主要代表秘密會議中稱：區產主義對西半球「極為危險」及要求美洲各國壓制共產活動。反共決議與泛美國家在戲時所採用之反納粹方案相同。漢氏於事後表示稱：罵歇爾對國際局勢並不完全悲觀。</p>
<h3>南韓普選　延遲一天</h3>
<p>五九日蝕韓人以爲不祥</p>
<p>〔中央社漢城三日合衆電〕聯合國赴韓代表團，爲順從朝鮮傳統之迷信觀念，已同意延遲南韓選舉一天，以免選舉與日蝕適逢一日。聯合國赴韓代表團於霍奇將軍述及日蝕日進行選舉，將爲數千韓人認係不祥之兆一點後，乃同意改於五月十日進行選舉。</p>

<p>〔聯合社飛盛頓四日電〕比利時攝政王查理與內閣總理史巴克，今日飛抵此間訪問，現定六日晚正式拜會杜魯門總統。</p>
<h3>新聞會議籲請聯合國　公允分配白報紙　聯合國代表主中法荷有優先權</h3>
<p>〔路透社日內瓦三日電〕國際新聞大會議決世界大部份區域白報紙之缺乏，爲對於新聞及意思自由流通之基本阻碍，當議決議請聯合國經濟與俗社會理事會，立即注意白報紙世界供應量之增加及分配之力求公允。</p>
<p>聯合國敎育科學文化組織之代表，蒞會說明一九四七年度各國白報紙之分配情形，並透露該組織已向美國建議請其自動放棄向加拿大訂購之五千萬噸白報紙，俾由中。法。荷等最需白報紙之三戰災國分配。美代表美報業公會會長馬丁表示，美政府贊助此項建議，自當盡力協助。</p>
<p>〔中央社日內瓦三日合衆電〕聯合國新聞自由會議主席羅慕洛，頃發表聲明，說明新聞自由會議開幕以來之經過。渠稱：會議處理議程之速度，出乎一般意料，預期會議將可提供新聞自由草約一二件。渠謂：「東西兩方關於新聞自由觀念之異見，可能調協，西方堅持新開自由之範圍，應爲廣大，東歐國家則强調隨自由而俱在之責任。西方維護批評之權利，東歐國家則認爲批評常轉變而爲祗毀。此方面之歧見，似非爲　法彌補之鴻溝。寳際言之，歧見主要爲着重點之不同而已」。</p>
<h3>美調查團抵檀島　正起草對日報告　定下週送呈杜魯門總統</h3>
<p>〔合衆社檀香山四日電〕攜有日本新秘密資料之屈拉普使團，定四日飛往舊金山，該團於三日晚秘密抵達此間後，即赴福脫蕭脫以完成彼等之報吿。該團本定於三日晚赴舊金山，因飛機機械發生障礙不克起飛。此項秘密報吿，定下週交與杜魯門總統。觀察家稱，此報吿可能改變日本佔領政策。</p>
<p>〔合衆社東京四日電〕在盟軍統帥部壓力之下，政府員工工會雖於上週停止工潮，但對於政府所提議月薪增至二，九二〇日元之折衷方案，尙未予以最後解決。按目前底薪為一千八百日元。</p>
<h3>陳納德將軍論美國對華政策</h3>
<p>克里浦斯霍華特系報業聯合會版權所有</p>
<p>本報編譯室譯</p>
<p>（九）決心要打回緬甸去</p>
<p>嚴格地講，作爲我們戰時對華聯盟主要機構的中緬印司令部，在史迪威將軍指導之下，從沒有爲中國做過任何軍事上的設計。</p>
<p>我確信戰區司令部在史迪威任職期間的檔案，將沒有任何軍事計劃可以透露，除了橫斷緬甸的攻勢，或者是戰區司令部從我十四航空隊司令那裏接到的空中作戰計劃之外。假如還有其他的計劃的話，至少我的司令部沒有得到。</p>
<p>假如眞的想要計劃過的話，那也一定是屬於極抽象性質的，因為戰區司令部缺乏對於適當的設計所必要的軍事情報。假如沒有可靠的情報，够得上稱為設計的東西，是不能想像的。</p>
<p>戰區司令部從來不依靠中國方而的情報，後者是旣不準確，又在作戰的價値上講往往太慢。但是在另一方而，戰區司令部又並不設法組織肖已的情報工作，並且在茶一個時期，的確會經禁止過我為第十四航空隊去做這種工作。</p>
<p>戰區司令部人員曾經堅持當德方面的攻勢「祗是一個搶米的襲擊，」雖然戰區司令部花當地並無觀察員，而和我自己的空中地上聯絡官的證言相反，其中有兩個聯絡官曾經和中國軍隊一同經歷當德的圍困。他們稱呼這一戰役爲有限度的攻勢。</p>
<p>為了維持空中的作戰，我不得不迫使戰區司令部給予我權力，以成立我自己的情報系統。這個系統，在史迪威被召回的時候，乃是美國在華唯一有效的情報機構。</p>
<p>常德之戰幾月之後，當重慶司令部成立一個新的情報機關的時候，他已經認識一個情報網的必要，而曾經在常德工作過的我的空軍觀察員，成功了它的核心。後來，杜諾文將軍的軍略作戰局願意提供人員和配備來加强我們的新機構，但是爲了某某幾種理由，始終沒有實現，其中我知道包括史迪威將軍的反對在內。</p>
<p>戰區司令部不但沒有替中國設計，而且也沒有設計的準備。緬甸作戰似乎被認爲本身就是目的所在。史迪威頗有意於完全置中國於不顧。</p>
<p>他的確反對在中國境內在空戰方面作切實的努力，其理由是這種努力將刺激日本人。我完全不懂他爲什麼對日本人在中國方面的反應是如此關切，而對日本人在緬甸方而的反應却毫不想到。</p>
<p>我一直明白贊成儘最擴充飛越駝峯的工作，一則是爲了想建立一個規模雖小而有效的空軍，二則是爲了要增强中國的地上部隊。我相信攻勢作戰是使日軍失却平衡的唯一方法，以待中國的軍隊成爲相當堅强。在好許多月份中，空軍乃是中國方面唯一可以支持攻勢的武器。</p>
<p>在中美合作期間，主要的軍事問題是很明顯的，那就是怎樣肥我們聯合的潛在力量，在對我們最有利的地區，打擊敵人。對於解決這個基本問題，史迪威將軍極少貢獻或者毫無貢獻。</p>
<p>對於他所以也就是對於在這個戰區美方的整個努力，完全爲一個目標所控制，那就是從一九四二年起，史迪威決心要打回緬甸去，因爲在一九四二年中日本侵攻緬甸之時，他曾指揮中國遠征軍而遭敗北。</p>
<p>有時候，史迪威可能誠懇地感覺到在緬甸方而進行攻勢以謀爲中國在陸上打開一條通路，乃是中國困難處境的一個合理解決辦法，但是我當時相信現在還是相信他的判斷是爲他想打回緬甸去的計劃所左右。</p>
<p>稍爲把問題分析一下，就可以看出一點，就是由於地形與距離的關係，陸上的一條通路至多祗能使少數用卡車載運的供應品運抵中國西南部的終點，而幾乎同樣重大的在中國內部運送分配的問題，依然沒有解決。對於後一問題的有效解決，在史迪威指揮之下的戰區司令部，並未作任何貢獻。</p>
<p>的確，經由緬甸公路實際上用卡車載到中國來的幾千噸貨物，以與三年史迪威將軍在該方面所費去的時間，生命和物力相較，不能算是所得已償所失。</p>
<p>再者，假如把卡車本身的重量减去，緬甸公路所實際載運的貨物噸數，爲數並不可觀，而且單使卡車一面開到中國來而不開回去，也是不切實際的。的確，中國需要車輛，但是她本身的資源至多不過能够維持一萬二千輛至一萬五千輛車輛，非要等開放一個港口之後，才可以增加其維持車輛行駛的能力。但是在港口開放之後，車輛當然可以從海上輸入了。</p>
<p>但是史迪威並未爲中國擬具一個卡車計劃，也沒有考慮到在中國所需的卡車已經足够之後，設法擬定一個在緬甸公路上卡車對開的計劃。有一點是頗有諷刺意味的，乃是第一批也就是最大一批配給緬甸公路的車輛，是五千輛道奇卡車，由美國國外經濟管理所派定，而史迪威和陸軍部對此均表反對。在一九四五年戰爭結束之時，中國所能容納的車輛已達飽和點。戰區司令部在史迪威的繼任人魏德邁主持之下，已經認爲緬甸公路上卡車一面開的辦法，是不切實際的，而史迪威及其屬員却一開始就主張如此做的。</p>
<p>所以對於緬甸作戰的唯一辯護，就是沿緬甸公路建設了一條輸油管，後者曾在幾個月的時間中把燃料輸往中國西南部。</p>

<h3>雷諾大弄玄虛　倉皇飛遁瀛島　護照被扣留今後恐難再得　中美官方俱表驚異憤慨</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕雷諾之探險專機，在雷諾「各事處置結束前決不離華」之公開保證下，竟於昨日下午一時四十五分以試機爲名，再度偸飛離華赴東京。雷諾本人在飛機引擎發動之後及時　登，演出戲劇性之脫逃一幕。其護照則遭扣留，使其個人在華之信譽，留下不可磨滅之汚點。</p>
<p>探險機二日淸晨偸飛離滬赴印，傍晚折回，雷諾於三日晨乘中航公司客機晋京向我當局解釋，承認「失禮及思慮欠週」，保證在探險隊中國隊員返抵南京及各事結束前，探險機決不離華。同時　稱其飛機須時時加油與發動引擎，否則即會損壞。當時我方准其所請，立即通知上海民航局將原有之警衛兩人撤剩一人，並准其加油。不料昨日該機即以加油及試臉引擎爲名，驟然飛去。</p>
<p>雷諾本人昨晨自京乘夜車抵滬，行蹤詭秘。上午八時一刻在百老匯大樓喚大新巴着車行汽車一輛，號碼爲二一一八〇，由司機卞錫林駕駛，先至華懋飯店，囑汽車在外等候，約二小時後乘原車赴百老匯大樓，將近白渡橋時，又折回華戀飯店，即與其機師等將行　取下，直駛龍華機場，時約十二時許。至機塲後仍囑該汽車等候。司機卞錫林候至下午二時，發覺雷諾等業已乘機飛去，因車資未付，乃頓足大跳。後來在車內坐墊上發現國幣二百萬元，始驅車而返。由此可見雷諾早已蓄意飛走，其囑司機等候者，乃故佈疑陣而已。</p>
<p>欺騙駐機場警官</p>
<p>雷諾抵機塲後，宣稱係爲其飛機加油及試驗引擎，故民航局辦事處不疑有他，乃任其機師登機。在一時十五分該機引擊發勸一次，旋即停止，至一時三十分再度發動。此時雷諾本人爲駐機塲之外事警察巡官謝鼎豐發現，因彼於二日擅飛印度，其護照未辦出境簽證手續，於法不合，故謝巡官即向其索取護照，擬予扣留。雷諾起先稱，其護照在旅館內未帶來，謝巡官即吿以可打電話到旅館派人送來。雷諾遂進電話間打一電話，（此電話後悉係打至美國領事館者，因雷諾飛走後半小時，美領事館曾派人至機塲詢問警察是否擬扣留雷諾本人，領事館之人對於雷諸遽行飛走亦表示驚異。）在打畢電話後隔相當時間，雷諾忽然揚言記得護照是在身邊，隨即取出呈繳，謝巡官乃給予收條一紙，而將該護照扣留。此時雷諾見飛機引擎已兩度發動，對謝巡官稱因機場中有人向其索原子筆，擬至飛機上拿取。謝巡官因職責僅爲扣留其護照，乃任其奔向飛機。</p>
<p>言諾旣上飛機，機身立即開動而駛向跑道，靈時間已騰空而去突。民航局本派有警衛一人看守，但因事出倉促，此時惟有目注其離去而已。</p>
<p>不顧管制站電阻</p>
<p>此突然之行動，非但出於民航局之意料，即空中管制班事先亦未知悉，故絕對爲不合法之飛行。機塲控制塔當時曾以無綫電囑其降落，並以紅燈照射，江灣美軍管理之管制站亦以無綫電通知，但該機不加理睬，旋即不知去向。直至下午四時十二分始發一電向美空軍管制站報吿方位，已在赴東京途中，至下午七時三十分，又接報吿，未經許可，降落東京羽田機塲矣。</p>
<p>據空中管制班人員談稱，按照航空規則，飛機起飛時須至跑道盡端起步，但探險機在一轉入跑道後立即騰空。又起飛必須以逆風方向，而探險機則循順風方向向南起飛，故雷諾飛機之破壞國際航空規則已不一而足。現民航局上海辦事處已將經過情形電吿南京當局，或將引起中美一番交涉矣。</p>
<p>美使館表示驚異</p>
<p>又據南京電稱：美大使館方面亦已獲悉雷諾潛遁護照被扣等情，對雷諾此種行動，殊表驚異，並表示。美政府嗣後恐不至再給以新護照云。</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕據聯合社南京消息，美國官員與中國科學家對於雷諾之行徑，深表憤慨。中央研究院秘書長薩本棟指責雷諾未能恪守其諾言，即在探險問題所引起之爭執未解決前，渠決不離開中國。美國大使館官員會親見奮諾向薩氏提出此項諾言，現將就此事向華盛頓及東京提出詳細報吿。惟謂，對雷諾在未獲准許前遽離上海一點，如欲採取正式行勸，必須由中國政府方面發動云。</p>
<h3>雷諾談離華原因　在避免經濟困難</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕舊金山四日廣播：東京訊，雷諾已飛抵此問。渠謂，渠之所以在未獲准許前飛離中國，乃在避免經濟上可能引起之困織，載至目前爲止，爲此項採險工作而耗去之資金，已達廿五萬美元云。</p>
<h3>蘭學術團體主張　自力探測積石山</h3>
<p>〔中央社蘭州四日電〕積石山探測工作應由中國團員艦續完成，蘭市十二個學術團號頃集會決議，請中央研究院照辦。四北行轅張主任治中表示，倘中央研究院無異議，行轅及甘靑兩省府，決定全力支助。</p>

<h3>遊春遭機槍掃射　電臺員工傷五人</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕交通部上海國際電台報務科人員三十二人，昨乘電合大卡草一輛，於上午七時開往常熟春遊。八時廿分，駛至太倉站，時有靑年軍二〇二師派駐該地之士兵兩人及太倉縣警二人在塲負責檢查往來車輛，卡車以未悉前情，稍事停留後即繼續開行，引起哨兵誤會，致發生槍傷五人之慘劇。其中傷勢最重者，爲報務組姚本　，左腿中兩彈，腿骨已折斷，事務員蔣宗　右腿中彈，報差薛永貴則彈傷腿骨，此外尙有電台律師陸偉林及報差郭永敏二人，均受輕傷，事後傷者送太倉公立醫院救治，前者三人因傷勢較重，尙在太倉留醫中，陸郭二人傷輕，經包紥後，昨已隨車返滬療治。</p>
<p>此事之起因，據稱：係由於電合卡車經過檢查站時，未經檢查即行開駛，爲哨兵所不滿，最初曾鳴槍示威，但卡車一時不及停止，致更引起哨兵陸振裕之誤會，隨即以手提機槍加以掃射。聞姚杏　之傷勢，因腿骨業已擊碎，如能順利完成接骨手續，至少尙須休養三四月。姚原定下週訂婚，今不幸遭此意外、勢將貽誤佳期矣。</p>
<h3>寒食清明節　傷心此地來　虹橋公墓巡禮</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕在虹構公墓巡視一週，我們發覺「淸明」是人性澈底流露的一個節日。</p>
<p>名舞是方珍的荒塚前，松柏已經高及數尺了，不知誰替她在塚頭上放了一束鮮花，是她生前的相知？抑是她昔日的恩客？沒有留下姓名，但是我們彷彿從花朶上嗅到了友情的溫暖和芬芳。烈士程振章的墓地，兩天前曾有人來為它芟除　草，據管墓的點，那是他生前的一個朋友，孤零零地，辛勞了幾個鐘頭，這人間，這社會，竟還有這樣的朋友存在着嗎？</p>
<p>有一方石碑上刻着寥寥的幾行英文：「將我受創的心，寫在這石塊上，我永不會忘懷，訣別你的那個微雨的費昏」。據說石碑下面躺着的是一個逝去已經十八年的奧籍少女，丈夫是旅滬多年的外僑，現在已過中年了，少女死後，他矢志不娶，每年淸明前後，必定到墓前來默誦遭碑文一週，今年還沒有來過，有人猜測他許是懷了憂鬰的心返歸故國了。</p>
<p>有一對老夫婦在他們的殤兒墓旁，督飭工匠　　花草，並且親自俯身拂去敗葉；在他們背後，有一個外僑對着十字架，喃喃地默誦聖經；另外一個老人拄着手杖，在一方墓地週圍徘徊，嘴裏不停地咕嚕着：「慢慢地吃吧！你是常常打噎的！」原來墓頭正安放着一盆自製的糕餅。</p>
<p>幾處燒着錫箔，幾處供着祭菜，每一個人在墓前都顯得那麼親切而鄭重。很多墓碑上刻着死者的遺言：「我的心在這裏我到眞正的家。」生死雖然永別，這一點眞正的蘊藏在彼此間的人性，在清明節日不免都充分地表現出來。</p>

<h3>雷諾發跡史</h3>
<p>〔本報特寫〕身胚結實，面色紅潤，原子筆大王雷諾，在外形上帶着濃厚的商人氣息，這一位大言不慚要征服新世界的美國百萬富翁，他五十五年的生命整個是一部起起落落的冒險史，以二十五元美金起家，雷諾發過兩次財，又兩次蕩然無存，到現在以製造原子筆聞名於世，在他已經是第三次的財富了。</p>
<p>二十歲那年，雷諾經手一輛舊汽車的買賣，賺到二十五元美金。他用這廿五元買進一家修補汽車胎的小舖子，替人家補補輪胎，裝裝車管，小舖子生意很平常，談不上有什麼出息。</p>
<p>靈機一動滿協而歸</p>
<p>然而他　得抓住機會，那時候有一家汽車公司關門，將大批的車胎存貨都出盤，雷諾靈機一動，馬上用很低的價錢，把所有這些車胎買下，然後他立刻去找芝加哥論　　　廣吿推銷員，委託在報上登一幅全版廣告，廣吿內容說他有大批的車胎，願以極低的價格出售。等到廣吿拼版拼好，他拿了「大樣」去見製造這種車胎廠商的駐芝加哥代表，那位代表看了廣吿上以這樣低廉的價錢大量傾銷，深恐整個的車胎市價會受到影響而狂瀉，立刻打電話到紐約總公司去請示，總公司命令他向雷諾收購，於是雷諾就得其所哉了。他開出高價，滿戰而歸，再通知芝加哥論壇報取消廣吿。這樣一來，他就平白地獲得了一筆財富，從此陸續地經營，到二十六歲那年，已經躋身於富翁之林了。</p>
<p>流落紐約賸一元錢</p>
<p>錢一多，慾望亦隨之增大，雷諾以他的資金從事各種冒險事業，自不免有失着的時候。在三十歲的時候，他破產了。但是俗語說跌得倒也爬得起，在五年以內他又弄到了更多的金錢。一眞到一九三零年，全國不景氣的浪潮再把他衝到了普羅街頭，那時候他已經三十八歲。</p>
<p>聖誕快要到了，他流落在紐約，身邊即將用完最後的一元錢，情形非常的狼狽。到聖誕的前一天，他設法借到了一百五十元，與他的妻子共同回到芝加哥，想在老家勸動腦筋。</p>
<p>二次走上鴻運大道</p>
<p>聖誕後　天，他一淸早六點鐘就起身，在市內東蕩西逛希望能啓發點謙錢的靈感。從早晨六點錡到下午六點鐘，從星期一到星期三，他像發瘋一般的走來走去，到結果居然給他我到了。他在馬路上看到一家店舖裏陳列着一架印刷招牌的機器，覺得大有「苗頭」，就跑進店裏去要店主把機器的作用表演給他看。第二夭他約這位店主叙談，用他的口才與機智，買下這種機器的專利權，一方面請朋友帮忙借一筆錢，到第二個星期一就開始設廠製造了。這稱機器專供店舖子印刷招牌與招貼，銷路極佳，雷諾從此一帆風順，又走上了鴻運大道。</p>
<p>開始造筆冒險成功</p>
<p>雷諾的原的原子筆事業也是冒險成功的。一九四五年他到南美洲去旅行，在那坡看到初期的原子筆，他員了幾枝回到美國，細細的研究改善，後來就自己開始製造。在這時候另外有一位鋼筆商已經在南美洲化錢買了原子筆的專利權，聽說雷諾已在製造，就警告那些向雷諾定貨的商人取消定貨，否則將以法律起訴。雷諾大爲恐慌，他立刻請了許多法律專家，替他想辦法，根據美國法律，只許向法庭起訴，不能出之以警吿方式，雷諾便先向法庭控對方以恐嚇罪。結果竟達到法律上不敗的地位。這樣一來，零售商都繼續向他定貨。當他的原子筆第一天問世時，買的人勢如潮湧，臨時請了許多警察來，才把秩序維持。在第一天中賣出了一萬枝。第一個月內他賺了五十萬元，第二個月賺了一百五十萬，此後不到一年，他的財產就達到　人的數字了。</p>
<p>原子筆盛況　僅曇花一現</p>
<p>可是，原子筆銷售的盛冲僅如曇花一現。不久美國廠商製造的一天夭多，他的營業就日見淸淡了。這時候雷諾又開始動腦筋，他自己買了飛機，到世界各地旅行，又叫他的機師奧登打破環球飛行的紀錄，替他雷諾揚名於世，更把他的原子筆帶到世界各地</p>
<p>這一次書諾想起到中國探險，轟轟烈烈而來，虎頭蛇尾而去。他的動機是否爲原子筆作宣傳，我們不敢確說，但至少他在中國大送原子筆是事實。最可笑的是他送出的原子筆中，有一種在筆套上貼一張「美金二十五元」的紙條，事實上這一　筆　不上美金一元。雷諾的爲人由此也可見一般了。</p>

<h3>一般物價　仍承前週平穩趨勢</h3>
<p>通貨膨脹後期物價之週期性波動，是與通貨膨脹而俱來的不可避免現象。抗戰勝利以後，五次較大的波動，本會以前已經列表說明（見自由論壇報一月十二日及新聞報一月一日元旦增刊）。本年度二月初，即陰曆新年過去以後，開始了本年度第一次物價大波動。本來照本報本刊第一期所述通貨膨脹後期各項特徴看來，物價週期波動頻率之增加實爲不可避免之事實，此次大波動不過爲本年度第一次大波動。</p>
<p>如上期本刊所說，此一度彼動始於陰曆年後第一週，到三月份第二週，即陰曆年後第五週而達最高峯。那一週中批發物價總指數上升百分之二十八·六，各類貨物如分別言之，建築材料類上升達百分之五十四，食糧與紡織品上升均在百分之三十二以上。從那一週較猛烈的波動之後，物價波動幅度逐漸减小，銀根也逐漸趨緊，似乎這一度大波動已進入一段間歇時期。自那一週到上週已歷三週，這三週中使物價稍趨平穩的因素很多，本刊前二期中亦已一一列舉說明，此若干原因中較普遍而對物價影響較持久者有如下列數端，此數項原因對上週物價仍發生很大的影響：</p>
<p>第一，上海物價急劇上升後，致超出內地甚巨。因而上海游資大量內流，此點可於內匯匯率之增高中見之。內地物價最近三四週內，遭此大量游資之侵襲，因而不斷激漲，尤以重慶，長沙，昆明等地爲甚。</p>
<p>第二，華北東北各地最近數週戰局之不甚順利使滬地游資及工業設備大量南逃，游資之南逃對本市物價之影響較易迅速表現，此項資金南逃之劇烈，由香港申匯最近一月之暴縮可見一般。</p>
<p>第三，物價猛漲後因交易籌碼需要之增加，而致銀根感覺緊促，亦爲一項必然現象。以上三項爲較持久之影響。</p>
<p>上週物價繼續以前二週平穩趨勢之原因除上列三項比較持久之因素仍繼續發生影響外，上週尙有較特殊之因素，此數項因素亦可分別列舉如下：</p>
<p>第一，美貸可能短期內成功，因此週二開盤（週一爲靑年節，停市一天）時華股全面直綫下瀉，景福中衣等現遞十四種跌停，永紗跌入一千六百元關內。週六本市各報載華盛頓二日廣播，美衆議院今夜通過兩院聯合委員會修正之援外法案，其中包括援華四億六千三百萬元。至此援華始成定案。但在未成定案之前對本市物價已發生不小之影響。</p>
<p>第二，短期國庫券之發行，本爲中央銀行總裁張嘉璈氏提議，而經政府同意者，現已在趕印中，不日即可印竣，俟立法院通過發行條例，即可在市上發售。大致本月下旬可以實現。此點又爲影響人心對銀根看緊，物價看低之另一因素。</p>
<p>第三，美金公債第一期第二次，第二期第一次，美金庫券第一期第二次，第二期第一次均定於上週三開始還本付息，市上流言政府將掛低外匯牌價藉以减少政府支出。此點在明眼人看來，似爲不可置信之流言，但在華股市塲及紗布市塲曾發生相當影響。由此亦可見通貨膨脹後期人心之脆弱，易受謠言侵襲已至如何程度！</p>
<p>第四，出售國營事業，政府早已決定，但因估價手續之費時及出售方式屢議未定，致久縣未決，但最近已日趨積極，致上週市塲又受其影響，而使人心對銀根看緊，對貨價看輭。</p>
<p>由於以上各種原因之影響，上週物價一般均仍繼續二週來之平穩趨勢。自週二起，銀根承前週緊勢，已因通貨之擴張而漸趨鬆弛，至週末而漸顯，暗息頻趨下落。上週二·週三食糧價格因產地報跌而趨降，食油·雜糧·麥粉一致趨跌，蓋因長江春水陡漲，皖糧旣能順流東下，蘇北匪患不靖，食糧大批南運，因此無錫——食糧產地——食糧擁到過多，價格大跌，上白粳每石最低達三百四十萬元，本市遂大受影響·紗布初開平疲，如週二四十二支藍鳳　跌進二億元關內·但週三又因平津客帮逢低搜求而出二億大關。週四本市政府公佈食米四月份配價，結果因配價較三月份提高，米市重起漲風。週五週六紗布雖見好轉，但四十二支紗終未破二億大關，米市更不見振作。燃煤價格上週仍穩，如焦作塊煤每噸仍穩定於一千四百萬之水準，但上週燃管會提高配煤價格政府將有最後決定，雖提高四成或六成尙無定案，但對煤價看高之影響自不容忽視。其他香烟，肥皂大抵較前週末之價為低，但上週與前週平均數相比仍未見下落。</p>

<h3>貨幣金融　貨幣增發銀根轉鬆　籌碼寬裕暗息趨降</h3>
<p>前後賡續凡達半月之久的本市銀根緊勢，至上週已成强弩之末了。此稱由緊轉弛的銀根走勢，至上週的下半週益見明顯。週四以前市塲暗息，大抵盤桓於三角一分半至三角四分半之間，證券帮多空貼息亦穩坐三角六分之高盤。但週五暗息已跌入三角以內，證券帮塲外貼息亦一致跌落，計多方做三角二分，空方更縮做二角四分。證券套利亦降至二角二分，與前週在四角以上之套利率相比，跌落竟達一半，市塲頭寸之鬆和，不難概見。</p>
<p>一週來商業行莊方面，大致講來，多單普遍，同業拆放至下半週寥落異常，而告緊已久之客戶透放，亦漸漸做開。週四以後，行莊方面解繳央行之現款，日不過一二百億，可知同業存底股實。六十號以後行莊交換結果，週二週三兩天，出數較大，共達八千億有零，但週四出數减至三百七十五億，較前週週末的出五百餘億猶見减少，週五交換結果，更一反行莊間接交換組經常差出之慣例，而差進七百餘億，這在二個月內還是初次，嗣後銀根將鬆濫一時，恐勢所難免。</p>
<p>分析銀根由緊轉弛的原因有幾點：第一國庫支出浩繁，通貨膨脹無法抑阻，如上週週五中央銀行又發出新關金券四種，以補籌碼之不足。第二，美金短期庫券二期到期，據悉，國家行局頭寸如此而外流者達數千億。第三，商品及一般金融性物品，一週來未離疲局，浮多了售，致籌碼寬裕，市塲銀根亦以此轉鬆。</p>
<p>上週國家行局之交換情形，除週一例假無市週二實進二千三百零五億而外，其他幾天幾一致有鉅額之差出，如週三至週五三天共出六千多億，再扣除商業銀行於國行之定存，三天國家行局之實出鉅達一萬一千多億，市塲頭寸，由是潤澤不少。至於洋商銀行之差進數字，一週來依然龐大，除例假日不計外，自週二至週五共差進六千二百十八億，從這裏隱然可見本國的資金仍在源源逃避。</p>
<p>內外匯率</p>
<p>上週外匯行市，基準率仍維持原盤。香港申電匯走勢平穩，週二十萬法幣合港幣一元一角〇一分，週五縮至一元〇八分，出入在港幣二三分之間。香港美鈔市價週一美金一元合港幣五元六角六分，至週五升至五元七角一分，按港幣美鈔間比率之波動，素不劇烈。香港黃金行市，自週二至週四，每華兩黃金合三百十八元五角（港幣）不動，週五則升至三百廿四元。</p>
<p>上週內匯匯率穗匯匯水自週二之每千元一百六十元升爲週三之一百八十元後，週四以後朱雙動。厦匯匯水，一週來趨降，但週五一度上升，週末又回降。渝匯匯水除週三百十元增爲七十元後，即見迭降，週末爲三士元。漢匯匯水亦走跌勢，匯水之普跌或穩定，表示上週本市資金並朱加速地籍該匯兌機構流出。本市津匯，上週自週一至週五，始終穩定於五十元之貼水。但週末突提至平匯，乃匯率普跌聲中之例外。</p>

<p>上週股市行情，先就華股來說，銀根的轉緊爲弛固爲一利多因素，但這一因素尙不足與美貸的遂漸走向具體化，以至爲美參衆兩院迅速通過等利空消息相匹敵。因上週銀根雖已轉弛，但彌延旬日的緊勢餘威尙未完全消散，加上外象均疲，港匯等其他金融性物品亦一時莫能振作，故一週來華股行市雖起伏屢見，但以週末市情與前週週末相較，大致仍見軋低。如永紗前週週末以一七九〇元收盤，上週收盤價爲一六五五元，新光上週週末收盤價更較前週者軋低幾近二成，其間中國絲業上週週末獨漲停，較前週週末軋漲約一成，可謂得天獨厚。一般說來，上週華股雖普見平疲，但其趨勢還是一致看好，這在週末的行市中可以概見。</p>
<p>外股一週來走勢雖亦起伏互見，但如以上週週末與前週週末比，已經有過之而無不及，是則市况比華股略勝一籌。各股中以會德豐之挺勢獨秀，上週末較前週末軋漲約百分之八，一般說來，嗣後亦可望隨銀根之鬆而見好面</p>
<h3>工商動態</h3>
<p>原棉未至　統稅先加</p>
<p>關於原棉恐慌問題之解決辦法，上月二十七日紡建公司曾舉行董監事會，加以商討，結論認爲要解決原棉供應這一問題，除加緊收購國棉外，對美援部份之原棉，亦應作訂購之準備。此外該會認爲在目前國內現狀下，國棉收購異常困難，故以外銷紗布掉換外棉，亦不失爲一良法，但據說政府原訂外銷紗布，以全國總產量百分之二十爲限。紡建當局特建議，如必要時，外銷紗布可超過規定限額，請政府放寬尺度，酌情照准。以上乃國營紗廠的意見，一半代表官方的看法，至於民間的棉紡織業同業公會方面，則認爲棉紡織工業爲我國工業之翹楚，政府亟應輔導發展，而使之增產並直接外銷，但因勝利後局勢之日非，以及管理政策之不當，致陷於目前危急之境况。</p>
<p>據該業負責人稱花紗布管理政策，自勝利後已更易三次，而效果則至微，渠更表示現全國棉紡織業對於統購統銷代紡代織之辦法並不反對，但希望其能澈底實施，俾解決各廠家之原料恐慌，爲此棉織業人士乃擬就花紗布管理改善辦法，並推派代表與政府磋商。但政府方面歷來一貫的策略，顯然除了所謂「扶助棉紡織業的發展」外，似尙企圖對於民間的物資加以控制，甚或掌握。上月廿七日，經濟部與國行當局曾交換花紗布產銷及管理政策之意見達一小時，據悉擬議籌組一「花紗布聯合配銷委員會」，隸屬經濟部，並由該部聘定中央銀行，全國紡聯會，紡建公司及六區棉紡公會等各單位代表組成之。該會設業務處，下設原料，外銷，內銷三組，原料組負責統購國棉及外棉，按比例分配各廠；外　組專事紗布外銷業務，以出口所得外匯之一部訂購外棉及機件物料，其餘提供中央銀行；內銷組專司全國各地紗布配銷業務，各廠產紗，須全部繳該會配核。假使該會能如期成立，無疑的民間紡織廠商，將全部隸屬於該組織之下，亦即是說當局完全掌握了這一工業部門所有產運銷的物資與機能。</p>
<p>最近期間原棉的供應，據央行負責人表示決無匱乏之虞，因據說在十天左右，即可有美棉八萬餘包陸續到滬，這當然是一個好消息，但一波未平，一波又起，原棉的陸續運來，雖給了本市紡織界一綫希望，但所利得稅非六倍預繳不可的法令，及棉紗統稅稅率的自百分之七增至百分之十的新規定，又給了紡織界一個不易終卷的難題。關於六倍預征所利得稅一案，市商會曾籲請當局設法補救，但得到的答覆是碍難照辦等語，六區棉紡公會乃於上週三決定復函稅局　其轉呈困難並要求變更辦法，本市一百一十同業公會，亦聯名蓋章電呈財部，請求變更，這個問題如何解決，恐怕要看雙方他持力量的大小而定。</p>
<p>至於增加棉紗統稅一節，棉紡業方面極力反對，並發表書面談話，認爲棉紗統稅原係從價征收，故紗價上漲所繳稅款亦隨之加重，規如再以稅率提高，殊非埀危之紡織業所能負担。全國紡聯會更以目前紡織工業情勢艱危特電呈行政院，立法院，暨財經兩部，轉呈國民政府將棉紗加稅案，重加考慮收回成命。故稅率是否能如期增加一節，日後恐尙有一翻熱烈的爭執。</p>

<h3>President Chiang Kai-shek Presides Over the Sixth Plenary Session of the Central Executive Committee, Announces Unwillingness to Run for President, Discussion Results Submitted to the Central Standing Committee for Study</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Office, 4th] The Kuomintang Sixth Central Executive Committee's Provisional Plenary Session opened at 10 a.m. on the 4th. President Chiang Kai-shek presided in person. 322 executive committee members attended. The discussion topic was the nomination of presidential and vice-presidential candidates and personnel selection. After a full day of deliberation, no final conclusion was reached. It was decided to hold a second meeting on the 6th to continue the discussion and make a decision. The preliminary agreed-upon principles reached at today's meeting were: (1) Whether the presidential candidate should be nominated by the party and who the candidate should be will be submitted to the provisional Central Standing Committee for study at 3 p.m. on the afternoon of the 5th and then submitted to the plenary session for discussion. (2) The vice-presidential candidate will not be nominated by the party, and a free election will be held. (3) In view of the fact that the nomination and election of presidential and vice-presidential candidates this time was too rushed, and no proper preparations could be made in advance, the next election will adopt the method of party nomination. Three months before the opening of the National Assembly, a national congress of the party will be convened to listen to the decisions of all comrades in the party regarding the candidates. Before the discussion, President Chiang gave instructions, first explaining why he had previously expressed whether or not to participate in the presidential election, because he was a party member and should respect the party's decisions and accept the party's orders. Before a decision was made, he personally could not express any opinion. Secondly, he declared that he had personally decided not to participate in the presidential election, and at the same time expressed that even if he does not serve as president in the future, he can still implement the party's policies and continue to fight against the Communist Party. He personally believes that the future president must possess the following conditions: (1) possess democratic manners, (2) have a deep understanding of Chinese history and culture, (3) be able to fully support the constitution and faithfully implement it, (4) have a deep understanding and research on international issues and the international situation, (5) be loyal to the country and have nationalistic ideals, and the president also expressed that he must not be a member of the Kuomintang. After President Chiang's instructions, Zou Lu first stood up and said that according to the current situation, the position of president must still be held by President Chiang. Committee members Pan Gongzhan, Gan Naiguang, Yu Youren, and others spoke successively, unanimously supporting President Chiang to serve as the first president. During the afternoon meeting, President Chiang once again put forward his opinions, hoping that the meeting could study them in detail. All the committee members present believed that President Chiang's attitude was sincere, and that this matter was of great importance and should not be decided rashly. It was decided to submit it to the provisional Central Standing Committee on the 5th for detailed study based on President Chiang's instructions, and then submit it to the general assembly for discussion.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 4th] At the Kuomintang Provisional Plenary Session, during the discussion of the issue of presidential and vice-presidential candidates for this term, President Chiang Kai-shek delivered a speech on the spot stating that he would not serve as a presidential candidate, and expressed his determination to shoulder the responsibility of suppressing bandits, quelling disturbances, and guaranteeing the implementation of constitutional government, and to continue to provide practical and effective service to the nation and the people.</p>
<p>[Another dispatch] The Nanjing Municipal National Assembly Representative Association convened a meeting of more than 40 representatives from all circles in the capital today to support Chairman Chiang's election as the first president and resolved to establish the "Preparatory Committee for the Capital All Circles Supporting Chairman Chiang's Election as the First President."</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Saigon, 4th] Various overseas Chinese organizations in Saigon's bank have sent telegrams congratulating the National Assembly and supporting Chairman Chiang as the first president.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Hankou, 4th] After the President of the Judicial Yuan, Ju Zheng, decided to run for president, the campaign movement has already begun here. The Wuchang Uprising Comrades Association telegraphed the whole country on the 4th, expressing its support.</p>
<h3>Signing of National Assembly Representative Election Issues Expected to be Resolved Satisfactorily, Zhang Fu Reported, National Assembly to Continue Preparatory Meeting Today</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Office, 4th] The issue of signing the election of National Assembly representatives can be completely resolved in two or three days. At 6 p.m. on the 4th, Yu Bin invited three signed National Assembly representatives, Ma Wenche and Sheng Zizhuang, to a meeting, stating that there is a solution, and that he intends to visit Chairman Chiang with Hu Shi, Mo Dehui, and others in the evening to ask for instructions, believing that a satisfactory result can be achieved. At around 8 p.m., Mo, Hu, Yu, and others visited Yu Jiaju of the Youth Party, and then went to the Chairman's official residence. Furthermore, signed representatives Ma Wenche, Sheng Zizhuang, and others went to the Provisional Central Plenary Session in the morning to petition.

<h3>Securities and Futures Trading Suspended From Today, Executive Yuan Stipulates That Securities Exchange Business is Limited to Spot Transactions</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Office, 4th] The Executive Yuan believes that in addition to the spot trading of securities, the Shanghai Stock Exchange has also opened a deferred delivery business for securities, which is a futures transaction. Buying and selling are often done by the same person, which is purely for speculative manipulation by those who buy and sell short. This is contrary to the original intention of advocating investment and assisting the establishment of exchanges for production enterprises. During the period of mobilization for suppressing disturbances, this speculative transaction is particularly harmful to the national economy and social finance. Therefore, regulations have been formulated to ban it: (1) The deferred delivery business of the Shanghai Stock Exchange will be suspended from April 5, 37. The outstanding accounts that have been made will be settled according to the original agreed date and shall not be extended again. (2) In the future, the business of the stock exchange shall be limited to spot transactions, and futures transactions shall not be conducted in any form. (3) Over-the-counter transactions shall be strictly prohibited. If brokers illegally engage in over-the-counter transactions, their licenses shall be revoked immediately and they shall be investigated according to law. (4) The supervisors stationed in the stock exchange by the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Economic Affairs shall be responsible for earnestly implementing the foregoing regulations without any leniency.</p>

<h3>The Situation in Southern Suiyuan Gradually Becomes Tense, National Army Voluntarily Withdraws from Liangcheng and Fengzhen, Bandit Army in the Southern Section of Pingbao County Is Defeated</h3>
<p>[Our Guihua Office, 4th] The National Army in southern Suiyuan voluntarily abandoned small points such as Tianjiazhen (old Liangcheng) last night in order to attract the bandit army to the near suburbs of Guihua, and then annihilate them by the outer troops. The main force of the bandits in southern Suiyuan is now 100 li away from Guihua. Fighting broke out 10 li south of Helin City on the morning of the 4th. Trains from Guihua to Baotou continue to run. Guihua City is already full of scenes of defending the city.</p>
<p>[Our Guihua Office, 4th] A spokesperson for the Guihua Command Post of the North China Suppression Headquarters stated: After being blocked in southern Chahar, the Nie Rongzhen bandit troops who committed crimes in the middle section of the Ping-Sui Railway attempted to escape the pursuit and annihilation of the national army and moved the Sixth Column westward on the 28th of last month to mix and gather with the Yao Zhe bandit troops on the border of Jin and Sui, and on the 3rd, they divided their forces from Youyu and committed crimes northward. They have engaged in fierce battles with the defending troops in Liangcheng, Tianjiazhen, and other places. In order to defend the strongholds and attract the enemy's forces, our highest military authorities have decided to withdraw from small strongholds such as Liangcheng, Tianjiazhen, and Fengzhen in advance, and thoroughly implement the policy of emptying the houses, gather the national army and militia, and defend Guihua. The defending troops and militia in Liangcheng, Tianjiazhen, Fengzhen, and other places have been ordered to begin to withdraw voluntarily, and the operation to annihilate the enemy in the near suburbs of Guihua has been deployed. The bandit army attacking Tianjiazhen is the Sixth Column. After one day and one night of fighting, the defending troops not only managed to defend the strongholds, but also sent a company of men to attack, accompanying more than 50 bandits, killing more than 400 bandits, and seizing more than 50 rifles and two light machine guns, which shows that the bandit army's morale is low and its fighting power is weak.</p>
<p>[Our Taiyuan Office, 3rd] A large bandit army that crossed the Ping-Sui Line and sneaked into the Fengzhen area fled westward. A brigade of bandits from Wutai also entered southern Suiyuan through Shanyin, attempting to establish a base in Sui.</p>
<p>[Our Beiping Office, 4th] The North China Suppression Headquarters announced: Guihua is in a tight situation, and the main force of the Communist bandits is moving towards Guihua in several groups from eastern Sui and northern Jin. Tianjiazhen has been under attack since the morning of the 3rd. The national army is sweeping northward from Yangcun on the Ping-Jin Line to Hexiwu, and the national army in Miyun on the Ping-Gu Line is also sweeping southward, forming a siege of Sanhe. The Communist bandits in western Liaoning have a tendency to flee back to western Rehe.</p>
<p>[Our Baoding Office, 4th] Military Information: Fierce fighting in the southern section of the Ping-Bao Line. The 5th and 7th regiments of the Nie bandits' 7th Column, which committed crimes between Gucheng and Xushui on the 3rd, were ambushed by the national army in the north and south sections of the Ping-Bao Line on the 4th. In the morning, the bandits were surrounded in villages such as Baitapu and Linlindian and resisted stubbornly all day long, suffering heavy casualties. The bandits have now collapsed and withdrawn to the west side of the railway, and traffic on the Ping-Bao Line can be restored on the 5th. Furthermore, Song Kentang, deputy commander-in-chief of the North China Suppression Headquarters, flew back to Peiping by special plane on the 3rd.</p>
<p>[Our Beiping Office, 4th] The Ping-Bao Line is still tense. There was fighting south of Zhuoxian this morning. The Songlindian station was harassed briefly last night. The Communist bandits attacking Xiongxian suffered casualties and retreated. There were minor intrusions in Xincheng.</p>
<h3>Linfen's Military and Civilians Bloodily Defend the City Walls, All Personnel of the Air Transport Brigade Withdraw to Taiyuan</h3>
<p>[Our Taiyuan Office, 3rd] The defense of Linfen is even more difficult. Most of the strongholds outside the East Gate have been destroyed by bandit artillery fire, and most of the power plants have also fallen to the bandits. The national army is working hard to recover them. The airport in the city is nearing completion with the unanimous efforts of women and children. More than 300 civil servants, students, and civilians who helped build the fortifications under artillery fire were killed or injured.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Taiyuan, 4th] The defense of Linfen has reached 28 days. The focus of the war has now shifted from the East Suburb Power Plant to the North Suburb Power Plant. On the night of the 3rd, the bandit army launched a fierce attack on our strongholds in the East Gate and the four northern corners of the city. The national army bravely charged and fought fiercely all night, repelling all the bandits and killing many of them. At dawn on the 4th, the national army attacked the power plant and, after dispersing the resisting bandit army, recovered some of the positions.</p>
<p>[Another dispatch] Xie Hanwen, engineer of the Civil Air Transport Brigade stranded in Linfen, radio operators Shen Shubo and Cheng Yu, were transported to Taiyuan on the 4th by pilot Bao Bu, who volunteered to fly a "flying jeep". In addition to the above-mentioned three people, the team's stranded personnel after the siege of Linfen also included Chief of Flight History Stewart, and Yunshu Peng Keli Sun Yuan. Wei Luoer, deputy manager of the team, brought a flying jeep from Shanghai to Taiyuan. After first evacuating Shi and Peng, the evacuation was shelved due to the poor airport in Linfen. This second time, Tian Lin returned to Taiyuan. The engine suddenly malfunctioned on the way, but fortunately the pilot was skilled and arrived safely in Ping.</p>
<h3>Large-Scale Encirclement and Suppression Around Changchun, National Army Continuously Captures Multiple Strongholds, Bandit Army on the North Bank of the Liao River Has Been Defeated</h3>

According to reports, the Fuyang offensive and defensive battle lasted for five days and nights. Because the national army's land and air forces closely cooperated in combat day and night, exerting great power, the bandits suffered about 10,000 casualties in consecutive days, and more than half of their elite troops were damaged.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Kaifeng, 3rd] The Henan local troops recovered the county towns of Weichuan and Yanling separately on the 2nd.</p>
<h3>Fierce Battle in the Middle Section of the Jiaoji Railway</h3>
<p>Bandits Outside Changle Near the City Pass</p>
<p>[Our Jinan Office, 4th] After the battles in Changle and Weixian in the middle section of the Jiaoji Railway broke out, the bandits launched a fierce attack on Changle and Hanting on the 3rd, and the battle situation was very fierce. The bandits outside Changle approached the east, west, and north gates on the night of the 3rd, and a fierce battle was brewing. The struggle for Jiulong Mountain, Fenghuang Mountain, Bailang Mountain, and other areas outside Hanting was particularly fierce. There was a small contact outside the Fangzi Airport, and the airport is still firmly defended by the national army.</p>
<p>[Our Qingdao Office, 4th] Weixian Telegram: The bandit army outside Changle and Weixian is composed of the Second, Seventh, Ninth, Thirteenth, New Fifth, and New Eighth columns, as well as local armed forces, totaling about 80,000 people. They are currently continuing to press on towards various strongholds.</p>
<p>[Our Jinan Office, 4th] Our reporter recently visited a senior general who flew to Weixian with Wang Yaowu yesterday and asked what the bandits' attempt to attack Weixian this time was? According to reports: After the bandits attacked Jinan last month and were defeated by the national army, they are still gathering their remnants and intend to occupy Changle and Weixian in order to fulfill their dream of opening up the Jiaodong Corridor. Moreover, the defending troops in the Chang and Wei areas are the Zhang Tianzuo troops, who have a reputation for suppressing bandits. Zhang's troops have always been feared by the bandits, and they are currently concentrating all their forces in central Shandong, attempting to strike Zhang's main force. However, Zhang's troops are in high spirits, and all of their troops are local soldiers, who are determined to fight the bandits to the death. Wang Yaowu went to Wei this time and gave many instructions. The fortifications of Weixian City are as solid as gold. It is believed that under Wang's command, the Communist bandits will never succeed.</p>

The water volume is increasing day by day, providing enough water power to turn six sets of water mills. The village was originally a desert area, and residents had to fetch water from mountain water ice blocks 40 li away. Now that this unexpected water has broken out of the ground, the residents are overjoyed.</p>
<h3>Foreign Minister Wang Issues Statement, Government Accepts US Aid with Heavy Heart, Promotes Democracy and Constitutional Government Without Avoiding Difficulties</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Office, 4th] The US aid to China bill was signed by President Truman on April 3. Foreign Minister Wang Shijie issued the following statement on the 4th:</p>
<p>The US aid to China bill has been passed by the US Congress and signed by the US President. The Chinese government and people are delighted to hear this. This is another expression of US friendship to China and a recognition of China's serious situation by the United States.</p>
<p>The various clauses of this bill remain to be implemented by the two governments in a spirit of cooperation. What I want to solemnly state at this time is that the passage of this bill may give the Chinese people a major spiritual encouragement. The impact of this bill cannot be estimated solely by the amount of money.</p>
<p>However, the Chinese government accepts this bill with a very heavy heart, because we will inevitably bear the ultimate responsibility for the success or failure of this bill. China is facing many difficulties today. At a time when the Communist Party is openly causing chaos and inflation is rampant, other countries may take other political paths if they encounter similar situations. However, we are determined to promote democracy and constitutional government at this time. The Chinese government will implement this political plan and the ten economic self-help plans announced by President Zhang with great determination and perseverance. This is the road to reaching China's unification and construction, and it is also the way to preserve the peace and security of the entire Far East. As long as we move towards this goal, our efforts will not be lonely. This is what I firmly believe.</p>
<h3>Scope of Use of US Aid Medical Subsidy Funds Has Been Drafted</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 4th] The Ministry of Health convened a meeting of health bureau chiefs from various provinces and cities on the 20th of last month to discuss the principles for the use of US aid to China medical subsidy funds and application procedures.

The aim is to gain time and apply them rationally. As for the subsidy figures for each province and city, they will be decided separately based on the actual needs and local conditions of each place. No discussion was held at the meeting. The application for this subsidy will be closed in June of this year. The scope of use is roughly as follows: (1) medical relief, (2) epidemic prevention (plague and cholera), (3) tuberculosis prevention, (4) maternal and child health and child nutrition, (5) construction of medical and health institutions.</p>
<h3>Editorial: After the Signing of the U.S. Foreign Aid Bill</h3>
<p>After the U.S. foreign aid bill was passed by a joint conference of both houses of Congress, President Truman signed it into law in less than twenty-four hours, and the State Department will begin implementing it within thirty-six hours. Such swift action by a democratic country is rare in peacetime America. Moreover, upon reviewing its contents, the total amount of U.S. foreign aid is $6.098 billion, which will be used to help countries in Europe and Asia resist the invasion and expansion of communist forces. This includes $463 million in economic and military aid to China. Therefore, this foreign aid bill is the most significant foreign aid since the U.S. wartime Lend-Lease Act. Its signing and enactment during the height of the U.S.-Soviet Cold War makes its significance even greater. As President Truman said at the signing: "This foreign aid bill is truly an answer from the United States to the challenges facing the free world today." However, President Truman repeatedly stated: "The United States is taking this measure to seek the recovery, stability, and peace of the world. Therefore, the purpose of this bill is to help other countries maintain conditions that allow free institutions to exist. The American people are determined to work towards world peace, and this provides clear evidence of that." At the same time, Secretary of State Marshall, who was attending the Pan-American Conference in the capital of Colombia, was delighted to receive the news of President Truman's signing of the foreign aid bill, saying: "The signing of this bill is a historic step in American foreign policy."</p>
<p>The large-scale U.S. foreign aid plan was first proposed by Secretary of State Marshall in a speech at Harvard University on June 15th last year. This issue has sparked intense debate in both American public opinion and in both houses of Congress. As the saying goes, "the wise see wisdom, and the benevolent see benevolence," and opinions varied greatly. In November of last year, President Truman, seeing the deepening international crisis, convened a special session of Congress, which passed an emergency foreign aid bill of $597 million. The long-term aid to Europe bill proposed by President Truman was debated until today, when it finally reached a concrete conclusion, and the long-term aid plan can now be implemented. The slowness of this development process has caused people around the world to express concern about the slow action of democratic countries. However, this time, seeing President Truman's swift action, one cannot help but feel optimistic. As President Truman said: "The passage of the foreign aid bill contains a significant meaning, which is that a bipartisan policy can enable us to take effective action; it also proves that taking swift and effective action for peace does not conflict with our democratic discussions." Therefore, President Truman's swift signing of the foreign aid bill has given us the following thoughts:</p>
<p>First, the U.S. government has now become particularly alert to the current international crisis. The recent series of tragic events in Czech democracy has not only made the American people deeply aware of the threat of communist forces, but has also shaken President Truman's confidence in world peace. Therefore, the United States has no choice but to catch up quickly in order to save the world from collapse. Looking at Europe, although the Western European Union of five countries has been established, it is weak and cannot confront the Eastern European bloc. If the United States does not immediately provide economic assistance, the Western European Union will be meaningless. In particular, the Soviet Union's ambition towards Italy is obvious to all. With the general election on April 18th approaching, and seeing the activity of the Italian communists, if the United States continues to stand idly by, the victory of the Italian communists is assured. If that happens, the Soviet iron curtain will move from Eastern Europe to the Atlantic Mediterranean. What would be the point of providing aid at that time! At the same time, there is a similar crisis in Asia. China is at the forefront of anti-communism and is currently fighting against communist bandits with international backgrounds. In general, the situation in Asia is better than in Europe, but if the United States does not immediately provide economic and military assistance to China, Asia will follow in the footsteps of Europe, allowing the Soviet Union to establish an unshakeable position in Asia. Therefore, whether in Europe or in Asia, immediate assistance is urgently needed. This is why the U.S. government has been able to act so quickly. Therefore, looking to the future, in order to deal with the Soviet Union's Cold War, the United States will be able to take swift and effective action at any time to stop the Soviet Union from continuing to expand its influence, and will no longer lag behind as before. However, on the Soviet side, it will inevitably step up its efforts to sabotage the U.S. foreign aid plan. This can also be asserted. Therefore, we predict that the struggle between the United States and the Soviet Union will become increasingly fierce in the future.</p>
<p>Second, the United States has a special responsibility for maintaining world peace and has now begun to shoulder this responsibility. It feels that both Europe and Asia are very dangerous, so it provides economic assistance. However, judging from the spirit of this bill, the focus of U.S. foreign aid is still biased towards Europe. They still believe that the crisis in Europe is the most profound, that the relationship between Europe and the United States is the closest, and that aid to European countries is more likely to be effective. Therefore, the assistance given to European countries by the United States is greater in quantity and has priority in time. Although we cannot be too subjective when observing the world situation, we ultimately believe that the United States' "Europe First" policy is a terrible prejudice that could lead to historical mistakes, placing the United States in an irreparable predicament in the Far East. Therefore, we still hope that the U.S. diplomatic authorities will broaden their horizons and observe the situation in the Far East in order to understand its interests and use them as a guideline for carrying out economic and military aid to China.</p>
<p>Third, the U.S. aid to China is still insufficient, both in quantity and time. Achieving the goal of "promoting peace and economic stability in China" is a very serious issue. However, a country surviving in the current international society should value independence. It must not harbor illusions of relying on other countries. Today's China needs foreign aid to revive and build the nation due to material difficulties, but we cannot place all our hopes on foreign aid. The most important thing is to rely on our own efforts. Now that the United States has begun to provide economic and military assistance to China, our country's only task is how to make U.S. aid effective! As the saying goes, "Heaven helps those who help themselves." Only in this way can we ensure that a large amount of U.S. aid comes continuously! This is something that the entire nation, both the government and the people, must deeply reflect on.</p>

The Enemy Property Administration Office then applied to the Suzhou High Procuratorate to have the case investigated by the local County Procuratorate.

<h3>News Freedom Conference - A Wonderful Overture - Dr. Zhang Pengchun Engages in a Verbal Duel with Bogomolov</h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Geneva, March 25] Winter quietly departs the Alps, and the United Nations Conference on Freedom of the Press brings boundless spring to Lake Geneva. The blue lake reflects the "League of Nations Building" standing on its shore, a milky white structure shimmering with rays of light in the sun. This "Palace of Peace," built with ten years of effort and millions of US dollars, once, before World War II, saw "peace envoys" from various countries appear like ephemerals. Now, times have changed, and it has become a place for our journalists to negotiate.</p>
<p>Defeated the Soviet Motion with Twenty-Seven Votes to Six</p>
<p>Bogomolov is the Soviet Ambassador to France, a balding, burly, and dignified diplomat. He shares the same surname as the former Soviet Ambassador to China but has no family relationship. Last early winter, the United Nations Human Rights Commission met in Geneva, and the Soviet side was also led by this Bogomolov, engaging in debates with Mrs. Roosevelt. This time, at the United Nations Conference on Freedom of the Press, Bogomolov fired the first shot, wanting the member states of the United Nations, and those invited to participate in the news freedom conference, such as Romania and Bulgaria, to have the right to vote. Bogomolov's proposal was that before the election of the chairman of the electoral college, Dr. Zhang Pengchun, the chief representative of China, advocated that the chairman should be elected according to procedure, without inserting unexpected side issues. The so-called "according to established procedure" meant that, according to the original intention of the Social and Economic Council, non-UNC member states invited to attend had the right to speak but no right to vote. After a verbal battle, China defeated the Soviet Union's temporary motion with twenty-seven votes to six.</p>
<p>Three Wonderful Debates – Purely Diplomatic Issues</p>
<p>On the first day of the meeting alone, Zhang Pengchun and Bogomolov clashed three times, and all three times were extremely wonderful debates, but they all belonged to purely diplomatic issues. There was very little direct relationship with the freedom of the press itself. The first time was the election of the chairman of the conference, before the election issue of the non-member state delegation. The second time was when Bogomolov raised the issue of the right to vote for non-member states again after the chairman of the conference was elected. On that occasion, the Soviet side's lineup was very aggressive. First, Bogomolov spoke, followed by the representative of Bulgaria, a young man with curly hair and a gentle demeanor. He wore a blue suit and shook his long hair from time to time when he spoke. When excited, he would tap the table with his pencil, saying: "The United Nations invited us to participate, of course, they want us to participate in the discussion. If they want us to participate in the discussion, then we should be treated as brothers. Why should we be divided into member states and non-member states? Drawing a dividing line? If everyone thinks we are not worthy of the right to vote, then we might as well pack up and go home!"</p>
<p>Going in Circles – British Representative Speaks the Truth</p>
<p>This typical Slavic youth seemed to have an admirable enthusiasm. When he just raised his hand to speak, Chairman Romulo on the rostrum, because he had never seen him in any international setting, Romulo loudly asked the secretaries sitting on both sides: "Who is he?" Later, after checking the seat charts of various countries, he realized that he was the representative of Bulgaria.</p>
<p>The British representative, Mr. MacNeil, spoke most tactfully and earnestly. MacNeil was the chief of the British delegation this time. He opposed the Soviet proposal, but for the first ten minutes, he almost only spoke complimentary words, going in eighteen big circles, and finally said the true intention of the British delegation: "According to the intention of the Social and Economic Council, non-member states only have the right to speak, and definitely do not have the right to vote!"</p>
<p>French and Belgian Chief Representatives – Advocate Opening Voting Rights</p>
<p>France and Belgium are in favor of opening up voting rights. They believe that the United Nations organization should be open so that the foundation of the United Nations can be gradually expanded, without any restrictions of parochialism. The Belgian representative spoke very clearly, like a university professor lecturing on laws or formulas, winning applause from many Eastern European countries.</p>
<p>The most wonderful thing was the representatives of Albania and Greece. The chief representative of Albania had a hoarse voice, as if he had just caught a cold. At first, he supported his head with his right hand, and then simply leaned his upper body on the podium. He recited many of Albania's "War of Resistance" achievements, and then talked about how many people Albania had, how much land, and why it did not have the right to vote. He also said: Albania loves peace, and although it is not a "member state," it has long had a tendency to join the United Nations. This time, Albania was invited to participate in the discussion of "Freedom of the Press," and of course, it should enjoy the right to vote.</p>
<p>The Greek representative stood up and denounced Albania and Bulgaria, accusing them of aggressive behavior against Greece, "People see each other as rivals are especially hostile." This Greek chief representative, with a red head and face like Guan Yu, delivered a long speech that was tens of thousands of miles away from "Freedom of the Press," and finally said: "I agree with the opinions of the United States, Britain, and China that non-member states do not have the right to vote!"</p>
<p>Seizing on Other People's Loopholes – Winning Much Applause</p>
<p>Zhang Pengchun was undoubtedly the most brilliant performer in the morning and afternoon sessions of the first day. His fluent English and quick thinking enabled him to debate logically. He seized on a loophole in the Bulgarian representative's argument and then repeatedly emphasized the shortcomings of the other party's theory, winning much applause. A British colleague gave me a thumbs up and said: "He is a great debater!" Another American colleague said: "Zhang Pengchun's eloquence is really excellent, but he is a bit too theatrical!"</p>
<p>Zhang Pengchun not only spoke well on the first day but also spoke a lot. His third debate with the Russian delegation was for the "Outer Mongolia issue." The Soviet representative suddenly gave a long "Overview of Outer Mongolia" in the middle of the agenda, reporting how many schools Outer Mongolia had opened, how many factories had been built, how many theaters had been built, and how many newspapers and books had been published since the "People's Revolution" in 1921. He also claimed that "It is inappropriate to prevent Outer Mongolia from sending representatives to the Freedom of the Press Conference." Therefore, Russia proposed to supplement the list of delegates to the conference with Outer Mongolia.</p>
<p>The Issue of Outer Mongolia's Attendance – Was Also Defeated</p>
<p>This unexpected difficulty was still "parried" back by Zhang Pengchun. The chief representative of the United States, William Benton, said anxiously: "Should we spend more time discussing freedom of the press? Or should we continue to debate in this roundabout way?" He cried out loudly: "Don't spend more time tampering with the agenda and rules of procedure." This meaning was roughly the same as that of the Chinese delegation. William Benton used to be the Assistant Secretary of State of the United States, and with his rich experience, he naturally spoke very appropriately.</p>
<p>International conferences are nothing more than debates. Any diplomatic disputes always have two lines that are very clearly divided. The start of the Freedom of the Press Conference was no exception. (At the Hotel des Etrangers)</p>

<h3>Berlin Traffic Control Issues - Soviet Union Willing to Negotiate with the United States - Soviet Commander in Germany Accepts British Invitation to Banquet - US Military Police Ordered to Withdraw from Around the Railway Bureau Building</h3>
<p>[United Press, Berlin, 4th] The Soviet Union today formally notified the US military authorities that it is willing to negotiate on the issue of traffic control in the Soviet-occupied zone in order to clarify the current situation. This is the first move by the Soviet Union to be willing to renegotiate with the United States since March 20, when it withdrew from the Allied Control Council for Germany. It is not yet known whether the Soviet Union has made the same notification to Britain and France. According to the US military government, although the Soviet notification reiterated its original position, it expressed its willingness to negotiate on some control details, but did not mention a date.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Herford, 3rd] British Chief of Staff Marshal Montgomery arrived in Mele City in the British zone of Germany today by special plane. He will first talk with British Commander-in-Chief Lieutenant General Robertson, and convene a secret meeting of senior staff of the British Army in the Rhine, before going to Berlin on Tuesday.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, London, 4th] The British Reynolds News reported on the 4th that the Soviet Commander-in-Chief of the Army in Germany, Sokolovsky, has accepted the invitation of British Commander-in-Chief Robertson to attend the banquet hosted by General Robertson next Tuesday. It also said that Marshal Montgomery is expected to attend the banquet.</p>
<p>[United Press, Berlin, 4th] At 1:10 a.m. this morning, the Soviet Union accepted the US request and ordered its eight armed guards to withdraw from the Railway Bureau Building in the US-occupied zone of Berlin. About 50 US military police who surrounded the building began to withdraw five hours later. The US notification last night requesting the Soviet Union to withdraw its guards stated that the appearance of Soviet soldiers in the US-occupied zone violated jurisdictional regulations, and if armed protection was necessary, the US military should handle it itself. It is believed that the encirclement of the Railway Bureau Building is just a gesture by the US military authorities in Berlin, aimed at responding to the Soviet Union's traffic control orders.</p>
<h3>Berlin Railway Traffic Gradually Returning to Normal - US Air Transport Work Stops - Soviet Fighter Groups Hold Night Exercises</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] New York, 4th Broadcasting: Frankfurt News, the US Air Force Command in Europe announced that it will stop air transport as soon as the goods prepared at the Frankfurt airport for transport to Berlin are shipped. This shows that railway traffic to Berlin has gradually returned to normal, and the food supply in the US-occupied zone of Berlin will not be in short supply.</p>
<p>Also News, air transport work has stopped tonight.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Berlin, 3rd] Armed US troops today set up obstacles at the intersection of the main road from Berlin to Potsdam as "retaliation," because the Soviet Commander-in-Chief in Germany, Sokolovsky, lives in Potsdam. US troops are also stationed at other road junctions from Soviet Berlin to the US zone, checking passersby. Two British coal trains and one US supply train have safely arrived in Berlin. The Soviet interference seems to be limited to passenger trains of the Allied side, and air transport and road traffic are operating normally as usual.</p>
<p>However, the Soviet authorities have notified the US military government that an unusually large number of Soviet fighter planes will be engaged in exercises last night, and the exercises will continue on the night of the 3rd. This notice has been forwarded to the pilots of the British, American and French aircraft using the Berlin air corridor. People from the British and American sides expect that the Soviet Union may soon further interfere with air traffic, but a spokesman for the British military government said that the night-time dispatch of large numbers of Soviet fighter planes is not unusual, as it is part of the Soviet army's spring maneuvers.</p>
<h3>Wartime Documents - Published by the Soviet Foreign Ministry - Exposing Britain's Appeasement Policy</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Moscow, 3rd] The first volume of wartime documents published by the Soviet Foreign Ministry, "Documents on the Eve of World War II," went on sale today. It includes the files of the former German Foreign Ministry from November 1937 to December 1938. This is the darkest period in European diplomatic history. Forty-four of them clearly show that Britain spared no sacrifice to appease Hitler's diplomatic policy. At the beginning, Lord Halifax (former British Foreign Secretary) and Henderson (former British Ambassador to Germany's meeting records with Hitler) stated Chamberlain's (former British Prime Minister) original intention to cooperate with Hitler. Regarding the entire Czech crisis, the documents show Britain's deceptive actions against the Czech government. The ending of the documents, the letter from the Polish Ambassador to Britain, shows that Chamberlain's prestige has been declining due to his endless policy of appeasement. Another document is the record of the meeting between the British Ambassador to the Czech Republic and the Czech Foreign Minister, showing that Britain was unwilling to guarantee the independence of the Czech Republic after the Munich Agreement.</p>
<h3>Implementation of the European Aid Program - Welcomed by France and Italy</h3>
<p>French Communists Are Preparing a Counter-Plan</p>
<p>[Reuters, Paris, 3rd] Prime Minister Schuman welcomed President Truman's signing of the foreign aid bill, saying that "the Marshall Plan will supply Europe with a large amount of materials, which is the main factor for Europe's economic recovery and the basic help for social and political stability. The recipient countries, especially France, will definitely not be deceived by those who falsely claim that the plan is a tool of war." Finance Minister Mayer said: "When President Truman signed the bill, I and all citizens of the free world recognized the importance of this minute. We should answer the kindness of the United States with our efforts to restore and rebuild the shattered society."</p>
<p>[Reuters, Paris, 3rd] More than 7,000 French Communists have gathered in Paris this weekend to prepare a plan to counter the Marshall Plan. They are union representatives of the Joint Management Committee established by law three years ago.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Rome, 3rd] Italian Prime Minister Gasperi sent a telegram to US Secretary of State Marshall, praising Marshall as the "promoter" of the European recovery plan. The telegram stated: "Your government has created the European recovery plan based on the principles of peace and human love, and has given great contributions to this plan, allowing free Italy to have the opportunity for international cooperation. I would like to express my highest respect to you."</p>
<h3>Soviet Ambassador Arrives in Turkey to Take Office</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Ankara, 3rd] The new Soviet Ambassador to Turkey, Lavrentiev, arrived here today. Since Soviet-Turkish relations deteriorated in 1946, the Soviet Union has only had a charge d'affaires stationed in Turkey. Political figures are paying attention to the new ambassador's activities.</p>
<h3>Soviet-Finnish Negotiations Stalled - Military Terms - Netherlands Firmly Does Not Concede - Two Finnish Representatives Will Return to Moscow with New Instructions</h3>
<p>[United Press, Capital of Finland, 3rd] The Finnish Cabinet today decided on the final reply to the Soviet Union's request to conclude a security treaty, which will be taken to Moscow by the two Finnish representatives. Informed sources said that Finnish President Paasikivi originally intended to agree that if the Soviet Union encountered a direct attack, Finland would defend its own borders, but Finland should have the right to decide the time of such an attack threat and when military cooperation with the Soviet Union should begin. It is not yet known whether the new instructions follow the same approach.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Helsinki, 4th] A reporter for the Chicago Daily Tribune said: Highly reliable sources revealed the following situation of the Soviet-Finnish mutual assistance treaty negotiations held in Moscow: At the beginning of the meeting, Foreign Minister Molotov asked the Finnish delegation whether it could use the Soviet-Hungarian, Soviet-Czech and Soviet-Romanian treaties as a blueprint. Finnish Prime Minister Pekkala replied, emphasizing Finland's desire to maintain neutrality. Molotov urged Finland to make suggestions. Pekkala said that there were many possibilities for suggestions, expressing the hope that the Soviet Union would respect Finland's special environment. He stated that the Finnish delegation had only obtained a treaty that would only apply during wartime and within Finnish territory. The Finnish delegation then submitted a draft treaty, which included the following points: (1) If Germany or its allies attack Finland, Finland will resist the aggression with all its strength. If its own strength is not enough, the Soviet Union will provide assistance after the establishment of a mutual agreement. (2) The Soviet Union shall not enter Finland to exercise mutual assistance rights without special permission. It is reported that President Paasikivi clearly stated before the Finnish delegation set off that the Soviet Union could only provide assistance after Finland's request. He also instructed the Finnish delegation to insist that both parties must support measures to promote peace and the United Nations organization, and neither party shall conclude an explicit agreement against the other party. The two parties shall cooperate in cultural and economic aspects, and neither party shall interfere in the other's internal affairs. The Soviet Union originally requested that the treaty be valid for twenty years, but Paasikivi insisted on at most ten years. This point could not be resolved during the negotiations and has been temporarily shelved. On March 27, Prime Minister Pekkala made a broad statement to the Soviet side, stating that Finland would definitely resist aggression with its own army, navy and air force, and the military terms would only apply during wartime. If military cooperation is adopted, both parties should respect each other's sovereignty. Molotov convened a meeting of the Soviet delegation for one hour and then stated that the Soviet Union could accept the Finnish proposal as a basis for discussion. Then Molotov suggested modifying the military part of the proposal to expand its scope of application. After Paasikivi received this information from Moscow, he is now drafting new instructions for the Finnish delegation. Finnish military advisors have pointed out to the President that the proposed modification by Molotov will cause broad wording and easy to have arbitrary explanations, such as a slight incident, seeing a bomb fall on a small island outside Finland's territorial waters, etc., which is enough for the Red Army to enter Finland at a cost of "mutual defense". At least four Social Democratic Party cabinet members and one Farmers Party cabinet member oppose military concessions to the Soviet Union in the current stage of negotiations, and a majority of members of Congress also hold the same view.</p>

<h3>Japan Discovers Shangri-La - No Change in Life for 300 Years</h3>
<p>[New Asia News Agency, Tokyo, 4th] Three miles from the sea surface of Atami, a famous Japanese hot spring, there is a small island named "Hatsushima", which has an area of ​​48 towns east and west, and 5 towns north and south (each town is equal to 2.45 acres), with a circumference of only 25 towns. It is a "Shangri-La" that is not affected by the chaos after the defeat in the war. There are only 40 households on the island, which is the same as 300 years ago. This proves that their lives have not been affected by the defeat, and because it is an island of the sea, the fishing industry is flourishing.</p>

<h3>News Conference Calls on the United Nations - To Fairly Distribute White Newsprint - United Nations Representative Believes that China, France and the Netherlands Have Priority</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Geneva, 3rd] The International News Conference decided that the lack of white newsprint in most parts of the world is a fundamental obstacle to the free flow of news and ideas, and decided to request the United Nations Economic and Social Council to immediately pay attention to the increase in the world supply of white newsprint and strive for fairness in its distribution.</p>
<p>The representative of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization attended the meeting to explain the distribution of white newsprint in various countries in 1947 and revealed that the organization had suggested to the United States to voluntarily give up ordering 50 million tons of white newsprint from Canada so that it could be distributed by China, France, The Netherlands and other three war-torn countries that need white newsprint the most. Martin, the US representative and president of the American Newspaper Publishers Association, said that the US government supports this suggestion and will do its best to assist.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Geneva, 3rd United Press] Romulo, Chairman of the United Nations Conference on Freedom of the Press, recently issued a statement explaining the progress since the opening of the Conference on Freedom of the Press. He said: The speed at which the conference is handling the agenda is beyond general expectations, and it is expected that the conference will provide one or two drafts of the Freedom of the Press. He said: "The differences between the East and the West regarding the concept of freedom of the press may be reconciled. The West insists that the scope of freedom of the press should be broad, while the Eastern European countries emphasize the responsibilities that come with freedom. The West upholds the right to criticize, while the Eastern European countries believe that criticism often turns into slander. This aspect The differences do not seem to be insurmountable gaps. In essence, the differences are mainly about different emphases."</p>

<h3>General Chennault on American Policy Towards China</h3>
<p>Copyright by Scripps Howard Newspaper Alliance</p>
<p>Translated by our Newsroom</p>
<p>(9) Determined to Fight Back to Burma</p>
<p>Strictly speaking, the China-Burma-India Theater Command, as the main wartime alliance institution, under the direction of General Stilwell, never made any military plans for China.</p>
<p>I am certain that the theater command's files during Stilwell's tenure will not reveal any military plans, except for the offensive across Burma, or the air operations plans the theater command received from me, the commander of the Fourteenth Air Force. If there were any other plans, at least my command did not receive them.</p>
<p>If there were really plans, they must have been of a very abstract nature, because the theater command lacked the military intelligence necessary for proper planning. Without reliable intelligence, it is unimaginable to have anything that could be called a plan.</p>
<p>The theater command never relied on intelligence from the Chinese side, which was both inaccurate and, in terms of operational value, often too slow. On the other hand, the theater command did not attempt to organize its own intelligence work, and for a period of time, actually forbade me from doing this kind of work for the Fourteenth Air Force.</p>
<p>Theater command personnel insisted that the Changde offensive "was just a rice-grabbing raid," although the theater command had no observers on the ground, contrary to the testimony of my own air-ground liaison officers, two of whom had experienced the siege of Changde alongside the Chinese army. They called this campaign a limited offensive.</p>
<p>In order to maintain air operations, I had to force the theater command to grant me the authority to establish my own intelligence system. This system, at the time Stilwell was recalled, was the only effective American intelligence agency in China.</p>
<p>Several months after the Battle of Changde, when the Chongqing Command established a new intelligence agency, it had recognized the necessity of an intelligence network, and my air force observers who had worked in Changde succeeded in forming its core. Later, General Donovan's Office of Strategic Services was willing to provide personnel and equipment to strengthen our new agency, but for various reasons, it never materialized, including, I know, General Stilwell's opposition.</p>
<p>The theater command not only did not plan for China, but was also not prepared to plan. The Burma campaign seemed to be regarded as an end in itself. Stilwell seemed intent on completely disregarding China.</p>
<p>He did indeed oppose making real efforts in air warfare within China, on the grounds that such efforts would provoke the Japanese. I completely fail to understand why he was so concerned about the Japanese reaction in China, while not giving any thought to the Japanese reaction in Burma.</p>
<p>I have always been in favor of expanding the "Hump" airlift as much as possible, partly to establish a small but effective air force, and partly to strengthen the Chinese ground forces. I believe that offensive operations are the only way to unbalance the Japanese army, until the Chinese army becomes strong enough. For many months, the air force was the only weapon on the Chinese side that could support an offensive.</p>
<p>During Sino-American cooperation, the main military problem was obvious, namely how to use our joint potential strength to strike the enemy in the areas most advantageous to us. General Stilwell made little or no contribution to solving this fundamental problem.</p>
<p>For him, and therefore for the entire American effort in this theater, was completely controlled by one goal: since 1942, Stilwell was determined to fight back to Burma, because he had commanded the Chinese Expeditionary Force during the Japanese invasion of Burma in 1942 and suffered defeat.</p>
<p>At times, Stilwell may have sincerely felt that launching an offensive in Burma to open a land route for China was a reasonable solution to China's difficult situation, but I believed then and still believe now that his judgment was influenced by his plan to fight back to Burma.</p>
<p>A little analysis of the problem shows that, due to terrain and distance, a land route could at most allow a small number of truck-borne supplies to reach the southwestern terminus of China, while the almost equally important problem of transporting and distributing them within China remained unsolved. The theater command under Stilwell's command made no contribution to the effective solution of the latter problem.</p>
<p>Indeed, the thousands of tons of goods actually trucked to China via the Burma Road cannot be considered worth the time, lives, and resources that General Stilwell spent on it over three years.</p>
<p>Furthermore, if the weight of the trucks themselves is subtracted, the actual tonnage of goods carried by the Burma Road is not considerable, and it is also impractical to have trucks only drive to China without driving back. Indeed, China needs vehicles, but her own resources can at most maintain 12,000 to 15,000 vehicles, and only after a port is opened can she increase her ability to maintain vehicles. But after the port is opened, vehicles can of course be imported from the sea.</p>
<p>However, Stilwell did not prepare a truck plan for China, nor did he consider devising a truck two-way plan on the Burma Road after there were enough trucks for China. It is ironic that the first and largest batch of vehicles allocated to the Burma Road, 5,000 Dodge trucks, were assigned by the U.S. Foreign Economic Administration, against which Stilwell and the War Department opposed. By the end of the war in 1945, the number of vehicles that China could accommodate had reached saturation point. The theater command, under Stilwell's successor General Wedemeyer, had recognized that the one-way truck plan on the Burma Road was impractical, but Stilwell and his staff had advocated doing so from the beginning.</p>
<p>So the only defense for the Burma campaign is that a pipeline was built along the Burma Road, which transported fuel to southwestern China for several months.</p>

<h3>Renault's Mysterious Escape to Ying Island in Haste; Passport Confiscated, Difficult to Obtain Again; Both Chinese and American Officials Express Surprise and Indignation</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] Renault's expeditionary plane, despite Renault's public guarantee that he would "not leave China before all matters were settled," once again secretly flew to Tokyo yesterday afternoon at 1:45 pm under the pretext of a test flight. Renault himself dramatically boarded the plane after the engine started, staging a scene of escape. His passport was confiscated, leaving an indelible stain on his personal credibility in China.</p>
<p>The expeditionary plane secretly flew from Shanghai to India on the morning of the 2nd, and returned in the evening. On the morning of the 3rd, Renault took a China National Aviation Corporation (CNAC) plane to Nanjing to explain to our authorities, admitting "impoliteness and lack of consideration," and guaranteed that the expeditionary plane would not leave China before the Chinese members of the expedition returned to Nanjing and all matters were settled. At the same time, he claimed that his plane needed to be refueled and the engine started from time to time, otherwise it would be damaged. At that time, our side approved his request and immediately notified the Shanghai Civil Aviation Bureau to reduce the original two guards to one, and allowed him to refuel. Unexpectedly, the plane suddenly flew away yesterday under the pretext of refueling and testing the engine.</p>
<p>Renault himself arrived in Shanghai yesterday morning from Beijing by night train, with secretive movements. At 8:15 am, he called a taxi from Daxin Bus Company, number 21180, driven by the driver Bian Xilin, at the Broadway Mansions, first went to the Cathay Hotel, instructed the car to wait outside. About two hours later, he took the original car back to the Broadway Mansions. Near the Waibaidu Bridge, he turned back to the Cathay Hotel, and took down his luggage with his pilot and others, and drove straight to Longhua Airport, around 12:00 noon. After arriving at the airport, he still instructed the car to wait. The driver Bian Xilin waited until 2:00 pm and found that Renault and others had already flown away. Because the fare was not paid, he stomped his feet and jumped around. Later, he found 2 million national currency on the seat cushion, and then drove back. From this, it can be seen that Renault had already planned to fly away, and his instruction to the driver to wait was just to create a false impression.</p>
<p>Deceiving the Airport Police Officer</p>
<p>After Renault arrived at the airport, he claimed that he was refueling and testing the engine, so the Civil Aviation Bureau office did not suspect anything and allowed his pilot to board the plane. At 1:15 pm, the plane's engine was started once and then stopped. At 1:30 pm, Renault himself was discovered by Xie Dingfeng, the foreign affairs police inspector stationed at the airport. Because he had flown to India without permission on the 2nd, and his passport had not gone through the exit visa procedures, which was illegal, Xie Inspector immediately asked for his passport for confiscation. Renault initially claimed that his passport was in the hotel and had not been brought. Xie Inspector told him that he could call the hotel and send someone to deliver it. Renault then made a phone call in the telephone booth. (This call was later learned to be made to the US Consulate because half an hour after Renault flew away, the US Consulate sent someone to the airport to ask the police if they intended to detain Renault himself. The people at the consulate also expressed surprise at Renault's sudden flight.) After making the call for a considerable amount of time, Renault suddenly claimed that he remembered that the passport was with him, and immediately took it out and handed it over. Xie Inspector then gave him a receipt and confiscated the passport. At this time, Renault saw that the plane's engine had been started twice, and told Xie Inspector that someone in the airport was asking him for a pen, and he was going to get it on the plane. Xie Inspector's duty was only to confiscate his passport, so he let him run to the plane.</p>
<p>As soon as Renault boarded the plane, the fuselage immediately started and drove to the runway, and took off in a blink of an eye. The Civil Aviation Bureau had sent one guard to watch, but because the incident happened suddenly, they could only watch him leave.</p>
<p>Ignoring the Air Traffic Control's Impedance</p>
<p>This sudden action was not only unexpected by the Civil Aviation Bureau, but also unknown to the Air Traffic Control beforehand, so it was absolutely illegal to fly. The airport control tower then instructed it to land by radio and shone red lights on it. The air traffic control station managed by the US military in Jiangwan also notified it by radio, but the plane ignored it and quickly disappeared. It wasn't until 4:12 pm that it sent a telegram to the US Air Force control station reporting its position, stating that it was en route to Tokyo. At 7:30 pm, it was reported again that it had landed at Haneda Airport in Tokyo without permission.</p>
<p>According to the personnel of the Air Traffic Control, according to aviation rules, the plane must start at the end of the runway when taking off, but the expeditionary plane took off immediately after turning into the runway. Also, the take-off must be in the upwind direction, but the expeditionary plane took off to the south in the downwind direction, so Renault's plane violated international aviation rules in more than one way. The Shanghai office of the Civil Aviation Bureau has telegraphed the situation to the Nanjing authorities, which may cause a negotiation between China and the United States.</p>
<p>The U.S. Embassy Expresses Surprise</p>
<p>In addition, according to a Nanjing telegraphic dispatch: the US Embassy has also learned about Renault's escape and the confiscation of his passport, and is very surprised by Renault's actions, and expressed that the US government may not give him a new passport in the future.</p>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] According to a United Press dispatch from Nanjing, American officials and Chinese scientists are deeply indignant at Renault's behavior. Sabin Dong, Secretary-General of the Academia Sinica, accused Renault of failing to keep his promise that he would not leave China until the disputes caused by the expedition were resolved. Officials from the US Embassy personally witnessed Renault make this promise to Mr. Sa, and will now submit a detailed report to Washington and Tokyo. However, it is said that if formal action is to be taken against Renault's sudden departure from Shanghai without permission, it must be initiated by the Chinese government.</p>
<h3>Renault Talks About the Reasons for Leaving China: To Avoid Economic Difficulties</h3>

<h3>The Social Affairs Bureau Plans to Stabilize the Index; Cooperative Federation Will Be Established at the End of the Month; Meeting Will Be Held This Week to Discuss the Draft</h3>
<p>In order to stabilize the cost of living index, the Social Affairs Bureau plans to promote the joint establishment of a cooperative distribution organization by various factories. The bureau will convene the responsible persons of the major industrial trade associations and the responsible persons of the consumer cooperatives that have been established in various factories this week to hold a meeting to discuss the establishment of the "Shanghai Cooperative Federation" according to the draft plan. The following will be established: (1) Factory Consumer Cooperative Federation, (2) Bank Consumer Cooperative Federation, (3) Government Consumer Cooperative Federation. The above three institutions are limited to be fully established before the end of this month. Below each federation, factories, banks, and government agencies with more than 200 employees will establish cooperatives separately. The distribution of goods will be controlled by the federation and the cooperative, and distributed to the employees. According to the chief of the cooperative section of the bureau, the establishment of factory cooperatives is to reduce the rate of increase in the cost of living index for employees. Bank cooperatives are to gather funds to purchase goods from other places for unified distribution. The establishment of government agencies cooperatives is to reduce the burden of living for public school teachers and staff.

<h3>The Director of the Bureau of Public Utilities, Gan Zengjue, Inspected the Shangchuan Railway Yesterday</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] Gan Zengjue, director of the Bureau of Public Utilities, crossed the Huangpu River to Qingning Temple yesterday afternoon to inspect the Shangchuan Railway Company. He inquired in detail about the restoration of the company after the war, and encouraged the employees to work diligently and carefully in order to achieve the purpose of serving the citizens. He then took the company's passenger car to Chuansha to inspect the replacement of sleepers and other projects along the line, as well as station roadbed and other equipment. Mr. Gan hopes that the company will repair the tracks destroyed by the enemy to Datuan (in Fengxian) within the year, so that the entire line can be unblocked.</p>
<h3>Spring Tour Attacked by Machine Gun; Five Employees of the Radio Station Injured</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] Thirty-two staff members of the Traffic Department Shanghai International Radio Station went to Changshu for a spring tour yesterday morning on a United Electric Company bus. At 8:20 am, when they drove to Taicang Station, two soldiers from the 202nd Youth Army and two policemen from Taicang County were responsible for checking the passing vehicles. The bus, unaware of the situation, stopped briefly and then continued to drive, causing the sentries to misunderstand, resulting in the tragedy of five people being shot. Among them, the most seriously injured was Yao Benyu of the Reporting Group, who was shot twice in the left leg, and the leg bone was broken. Jiang Zongyuan, a clerk, was shot in the right leg, and Bao Cha Xue Yonggui was shot in the leg bone. In addition, there were two other people, the radio station lawyer Lu Weilin and the Bao Cha Guo Yongmin, who were slightly injured. The injured were sent to Taicang Public Hospital for treatment. The former three were still hospitalized in Taicang due to their serious injuries. Lu and Guo, who were slightly injured, were treated and returned to Shanghai with the car yesterday for treatment.</p>
<p>The cause of this incident is said to be that when the bus of United Electric Company passed the checkpoint, it drove off without being checked, which dissatisfied the sentries. At first, they fired warning shots, but the bus could not stop in time, which further aroused the misunderstanding of the sentry Lu Zhenyu, who then fired with a portable machine gun. It is heard that Yao Benyu's injury is because the leg bone has been shattered, and if the bone-setting procedure can be completed smoothly, he will have to recuperate for at least three or four months. Yao was originally scheduled to get engaged next week, but unfortunately suffered this accident, which will inevitably delay the good day.</p>
<h3>Cold Food and Tomb-Sweeping Day; Sad to Come to This Place; Pilgrimage to Hongqiao Cemetery</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] After inspecting Hongqiao Cemetery for a week, we found that "Tomb-Sweeping Day" is a festival where human nature is thoroughly revealed.</p>
<p>In front of the desolate grave of the famous dancer Fang Zhen, the pine and cypress trees have grown to several feet high. Someone put a bunch of flowers on her grave, was it someone who knew her in life? Or was it her former patron? No name was left, but we seemed to smell the warmth and fragrance of friendship from the flowers. Two days ago, someone came to clear the weeds from the tomb of the martyr Cheng Zhenzhang. According to the person in charge of the tomb, it was a friend of his in life, lonely and working hard for several hours. Are there really such friends in this world, in this society?</p>
<p>On a stone tablet, a few lines of English are engraved: "Write my wounded heart on this stone, I will never forget the misty evening when I said goodbye to you." It is said that lying under the stone tablet is an Austrian girl who died eighteen years ago. Her husband is a foreigner who has lived in Shanghai for many years and is now middle-aged. After the girl died, he vowed never to marry. Every year around Tomb-Sweeping Day, he must come to the tomb to silently recite the inscriptions on the tablet for a week. He has not come this year. Some people speculate that he may have returned to his country with a melancholy heart.</p>
<p>An old couple was supervising the craftsmen to prune the flowers and plants next to their deceased son's tomb, and personally bent down to sweep away the fallen leaves. Behind them, a foreigner was silently reciting the Bible in front of a cross. Another old man was walking around a tomb with a cane, muttering, "Eat slowly! You always hiccup!" It turned out that a pot of homemade pastries was placed on the tomb.</p>
<p>Some places are burning tin foil, and some places are offering sacrifices. Everyone in front of the tomb seems so kind and solemn. Many tombstones are engraved with the deceased's last words: "My heart is here, I am going to my real home." Although life and death are forever separated, this true essence of human nature hidden in each other is fully expressed on Tomb-Sweeping Day.</p>

<h3>The Origin Story of Reynolds</h3>
<p>[Special Report from Our Newspaper] Stocky build, ruddy complexion, ballpoint pen tycoon Reynolds exudes a strong air of a businessman. This American millionaire who brazenly declared his intention to conquer the new world has lived a life of adventure filled with ups and downs. Starting with twenty-five US dollars, Reynolds made his fortune twice, only to lose it all twice. Now, renowned worldwide for manufacturing ballpoint pens, this is his third fortune.</p>
<p>At the age of twenty, Reynolds earned twenty-five US dollars by handling the sale of a used car. He used this twenty-five dollars to buy a small tire repair shop, patching tires and fixing tubes for people. The business of the small shop was ordinary, and there was no prospect of great success.</p>
<p>Returning in Triumph with a Flash of Inspiration</p>
<p>However, he knew how to seize opportunities. At that time, a car company closed down and put a large stock of tires up for sale. Reynolds had a flash of inspiration and immediately bought all these tires at a very low price. Then, he immediately went to a Chicago Tribune advertising salesman and commissioned a full-page advertisement in the newspaper, stating that he had a large number of tires and was willing to sell them at extremely low prices. After the advertisement was typeset, he took the "proof" to the Chicago representative of the manufacturer of these tires. The representative, seeing the advertisement offering a large quantity at such a low price, feared that the entire tire market price would be affected and plummet, and immediately called the New York headquarters for instructions. The headquarters ordered him to purchase the tires from Reynolds, which was exactly what Reynolds wanted. He asked for a high price and returned in triumph, then notified the Chicago Tribune to cancel the advertisement. In this way, he gained a fortune out of thin air. From then on, he continued to operate his business, and by the age of twenty-six, he had already joined the ranks of the wealthy.</p>
<p>Broke in New York with Only One Dollar Left</p>
<p>As his wealth increased, so did his desires. Reynolds used his capital to engage in various ventures, inevitably making mistakes. At the age of thirty, he went bankrupt. But as the saying goes, "if you fall, you can get back up." Within five years, he had made even more money. However, in 1930, the nationwide depression wave swept him back onto the streets. At that time, he was thirty-eight years old.</p>
<p>Christmas was approaching, and he was stranded in New York, about to spend his last dollar. The situation was very embarrassing. The day before Christmas, he managed to borrow one hundred and fifty dollars and returned to Chicago with his wife, hoping to come up with ideas in his hometown.</p>
<p>Second Time on the Road to Fortune</p>
<p>The day after Christmas, he got up at six o'clock in the morning and wandered around the city, hoping to find some inspiration for making money. From six in the morning to six in the evening, from Monday to Wednesday, he walked around like a madman, and as a result, he actually found it. He saw a machine for printing signs displayed in a shop and felt that there was "something there," so he ran into the shop and asked the owner to demonstrate how the machine worked. The second day, he arranged to talk with the shop owner. Using his eloquence and wit, he bought the patent rights to this machine. On the one hand, he asked friends to help borrow some money, and on the second Monday, he started a factory to manufacture it. This machine was specially designed for shops to print signs and posters. Sales were excellent, and Reynolds from then on sailed smoothly and embarked on the road to fortune again.</p>
<p>Successful Adventure in Starting a Pen Manufacturing Business</p>
<p>Reynolds' ballpoint pen business was also a successful adventure. In 1945, he traveled to South America, where he saw the early ballpoint pens. He bought several pens and returned to the United States, carefully studied and improved them, and then started manufacturing them himself. At this time, another pen merchant had already spent money to buy the patent rights for ballpoint pens in South America. Hearing that Reynolds was already manufacturing them, he warned the merchants who had placed orders with Reynolds to cancel their orders, otherwise he would file a lawsuit. Reynolds was very panicked. He immediately hired many legal experts to help him find a solution. According to American law, he was only allowed to sue in court and could not issue warnings. Reynolds first sued the other party in court for intimidation. As a result, he achieved a legally unbeatable position. In this way, retailers continued to place orders with him. When his ballpoint pen was first launched, the buyers rushed in like a tide. Many police officers were temporarily hired to maintain order. Ten thousand pens were sold on the first day. In the first month, he earned five hundred thousand dollars, and in the second month, he earned one million five hundred thousand dollars. In less than a year, his assets reached an astronomical figure.</p>
<p>The Ballpoint Pen Boom Was Just a Flash in the Pan</p>
<p>However, the sales boom of ballpoint pens was just a flash in the pan. Soon, American manufacturers were producing more and more every day, and his business became increasingly sluggish. At this time, Reynolds began to use his brain again. He bought his own plane, traveled around the world, and asked his pilot Auden to break the record for round-the-world flight, making Reynolds famous in the world and bringing his ballpoint pens to all parts of the world.</p>
<p>This time, Reynolds thought of exploring China, arriving with great fanfare and leaving with a whimper. We dare not say for sure whether his motive was to promote ballpoint pens, but at least the fact that he gave away ballpoint pens in China is true. The most ridiculous thing is that among the ballpoint pens he gave away, some had a "US$25" sticker on the pen case. In fact, this pen is not worth even one US dollar. Reynolds' character can be seen from this.</p>

<h3>General Prices Still Maintain Stable Trend of Previous Week</h3>
<p>The cyclical fluctuations of prices in the later stages of inflation are an inevitable phenomenon that comes with inflation. Since the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, there have been five major fluctuations. The Association has already listed and explained them before (see the January 12th issue of the Liberty Forum and the New Year's Day special issue of the News on January 1st). At the beginning of February this year, after the Lunar New Year, the first major price fluctuation of this year began. According to the characteristics of the later stages of inflation described in the first issue of this journal, the increase in the frequency of price cyclical fluctuations is an inevitable fact. This major fluctuation is only the first major fluctuation of this year.</p>
<p>As mentioned in the previous issue of this journal, this fluctuation started in the first week after the Lunar New Year and reached its peak in the second week of March, which is the fifth week after the Lunar New Year. In that week, the general wholesale price index rose by 28.6%. In terms of individual commodities, building materials rose by 54%, while food and textiles rose by more than 32%. After that week's more intense fluctuations, the amplitude of price fluctuations gradually decreased, and credit gradually tightened, as if this major fluctuation had entered a period of intermission. Three weeks have passed since that week to last week. Many factors have made prices slightly stable during these three weeks, and this journal has listed them one by one in the previous two issues. Among these reasons, the more common and longer-lasting effects on prices are as follows. These reasons still had a great impact on prices last week:</p>
<p>First, the sharp rise in prices in Shanghai has resulted in a significant excess compared to the interior. As a result, a large amount of floating capital in Shanghai flowed into the interior, which can be seen in the increase in the domestic exchange rate. In the past three or four weeks, prices in the interior have been constantly rising due to the invasion of a large amount of floating capital, especially in Chongqing, Changsha, Kunming, and other places.</p>
<p>Second, the recent unfavorable war situation in North China and Northeast China has caused a large amount of floating capital and industrial equipment in Shanghai to flee south. The impact of the southward flight of floating capital on prices in this city is easier to express quickly. The intensity of this southward flight of capital can be seen in the recent sharp decline in the Hong Kong exchange rate over the past month.</p>
<p>Third, the increased need for trading chips due to the sharp rise in prices, which leads to a feeling of tight credit, is also an inevitable phenomenon. The above three are more lasting influences.</p>
<p>In addition to the above-mentioned longer-lasting factors that continued to have an impact, there were also more special factors last week that contributed to the continued stability of prices from the previous two weeks. These factors can also be listed separately as follows:</p>
<p>First, the possible success of the US loan in the short term. Therefore, when the market opened on Tuesday (Monday was Youth Day, and the market was closed for one day), Hua stocks fell sharply across the board, and 14 types of spot deliveries, such as Jingfu Zhongyi, hit the limit, and Yongsha fell below the 1.6 million yuan mark. On Saturday, newspapers in this city reported that Washington broadcast on the 2nd that the US House of Representatives passed the foreign aid bill amended by the Joint Committee tonight, which included 463 million yuan in aid to China. At this point, aid to China was finalized. However, it had already had a significant impact on prices in this city before it was finalized.</p>
<p>Second, the issuance of short-term treasury bills was proposed by Zhang Jia'ao, the president of the Central Bank, and was approved by the government. They are currently being printed and will be completed soon. Once the Legislative Yuan passes the issuance regulations, they can be sold on the market. It is expected to be realized around the end of this month. This is another factor that affects people's minds and makes them look at credit tightly and prices low.</p>
<p>Third, the second installment of the first series of US dollar bonds, the first installment of the second series, the second installment of the first series of US dollar treasury bills, and the first installment of the second series were all scheduled to begin repayment of principal and interest last Wednesday. There were rumors on the market that the government would lower the exchange rate to reduce government spending. To discerning people, this seemed like an unbelievable rumor, but it had a significant impact on the Hua stock market and the cloth market. This also shows how fragile people's minds are in the later stages of inflation and how susceptible they are to rumors!</p>
<p>Fourth, the sale of state-owned enterprises has long been decided by the government, but it has been delayed for a long time due to the time-consuming valuation procedures and the repeated discussions about the method of sale. However, it has recently become increasingly active, which has affected the market last week, making people look at credit tightly and at prices as soft.</p>
<p>Due to the influence of the above various reasons, prices in general continued the stable trend of the past two weeks last week. Since Tuesday, credit, which had been tight the previous week, has gradually become more relaxed due to the expansion of currency. By the weekend, it became more obvious, and shadow interest rates frequently tended to fall. On Tuesday and Wednesday of last week, food prices tended to fall due to reports of price drops in production areas. Edible oil, grains, and wheat flour all tended to fall, because the spring waters of the Yangtze River rose sharply, so Anhui grain could flow eastward smoothly, and banditry was not calmed in northern Jiangsu, so large quantities of food were transported south. Therefore, Wuxi—a food production area—had too much food, and prices fell sharply. The lowest price of Shangbai rice was 3.4 million yuan per shi (unit of dry measure), which had a great impact on this city. The initial opening price of cloth was mediocre. For example, on Tuesday, 42-count Blue Phoenix cloth fell into the 200 million yuan mark. However, on Wednesday, it went out of the 200 million yuan mark again because merchants from Tianjin and Hebei bought it at low prices. On Thursday, the municipal government announced the rationed price of rice for April. As a result, the rice market rebounded because the rationed price was higher than in March. Although cloth improved on Friday and Saturday, 42-count yarn still did not break the 200 million yuan mark, and the rice market did not see a rebound. The price of coal remained stable last week. For example, Jiao Zuo lump coal remained stable at 14 million yuan per ton. However, the Fuel Management Committee raised the price of rationed coal last week, and the government will make a final decision. Although there is no final decision on whether to increase it by 40% or 60%, the impact on the outlook for higher coal prices cannot be ignored. Other cigarettes and soaps were mostly lower than the price at the end of the previous week, but the average number for last week was still not lower compared to the previous week.</p>

<h3>Currency and Finance: Increased Currency Issuance Eases Credit, Ample Capital Drives Down Implicit Interest Rates</h3>
<p>The tight money situation in the city, which had persisted for nearly half a month, reached its end last week. This trend of money supply easing from tight conditions became increasingly apparent in the latter half of last week. Before Thursday, the market's implicit interest rates generally hovered between 3.15% and 3.45%, with the interest rates for securities firms' long and short positions also firmly holding at a high of 3.6%. However, by Friday, the implicit interest rates had fallen below 3%, and the interest rates outside the stock exchange had also dropped across the board, with long positions at 3.2% and short positions even lower at 2.4%. Securities arbitrage also decreased to 2.2%, a staggering 50% drop compared to the arbitrage rate of over 4% the previous week, demonstrating the relaxed cash position in the market.</p>
<p>Over the past week, commercial firms and banks generally saw a prevalence of long positions. Interbank lending was exceptionally scarce in the latter half of the week, and customer overdrafts, which had been tight for a long time, gradually started to open up. After Thursday, the cash that banks paid to the central bank each day was no more than 10 to 20 billion, indicating the substantial deposit reserves held by the banks. Exchange results after the 60th day showed that the outflows were larger on Tuesday and Wednesday, totaling over 800 billion, but the outflow decreased to 37.5 billion on Thursday, even less than the 50 billion outflow at the end of the previous week. Friday's exchange results even reversed the usual pattern of indirect exchange groups among banks, resulting in an inflow of over 70 billion, the first time in two months. It is feared that the money supply will become excessively loose for a while afterward, which seems unavoidable.</p>
<p>Several reasons account for the shift from tight to loose credit: First, the national treasury's expenditures were vast, making it impossible to curb inflation. For example, last Friday, the Central Bank issued four new types of customs gold certificates to supplement the inadequate amount of currency in circulation. Second, two issues of U.S. dollar short-term treasury bills matured. It is said that several hundred billion dollars flowed out of the country through national banks. Third, the market for commodities and general financial goods remained weak over the past week, with more sales than purchases, leading to ample capital and easing of credit in the market.</p>
<p>The exchange situation of national banks last week, excluding Monday's holiday without trading, showed a substantial inflow of 230.5 billion on Tuesday. However, on the other days, there were consistently large outflows. The outflows totaled over 600 billion from Wednesday to Friday. After deducting the commercial banks' fixed deposits in national banks, the net outflow from national banks in those three days amounted to over 1.1 trillion, greatly increasing the liquidity in the market. As for the inflow figures of foreign banks, they remained enormous over the past week. Excluding the holidays, the total inflow from Tuesday to Friday was 621.8 billion, subtly indicating that domestic capital is still fleeing the country in a steady stream.</p>
<p>Internal and External Exchange Rates</p>
<p>The benchmark exchange rate remained unchanged in the past week. The trend of Hong Kong telegraphic transfer rates was stable. On Tuesday, 100,000 French francs equaled HK$1.101, and on Friday, it decreased to HK$1.08, a fluctuation of HK$0.02-0.03. The market price of U.S. dollars in Hong Kong was HK$5.66 per U.S. dollar on Monday, increasing to HK$5.71 on Friday. The fluctuation between Hong Kong dollars and U.S. dollars is usually not drastic. The market price of gold in Hong Kong remained stable at HK$318.50 per tael of gold from Tuesday to Thursday, and then increased to HK$324 on Friday.</p>
<p>The Shanghai-Guangzhou exchange rate increased from 160 yuan per thousand yuan on Tuesday to 180 yuan on Wednesday, and then remained stable after Thursday. The Shanghai-Xiamen exchange rate tended to decrease over the past week, but it increased temporarily on Friday and then decreased again at the weekend. The Shanghai-Chongqing exchange rate increased to 70 yuan on Wednesday and then decreased successively, reaching 30 yuan at the weekend. The general decrease or stability of the Shanghai-Hankou exchange rate indicates that the funds in the city did not flow out to those exchange institutions at an accelerated pace last week. The Shanghai-Tianjin exchange rate remained stable at a discount of 50 yuan from Monday to Friday. However, it suddenly increased to par at the weekend, an exception amidst the general decline in exchange rates.</p>
<p>Chinese and Foreign Stock Markets</p>
<p>Regarding the stock market last week, focusing on Chinese stocks, the shift from tight to loose credit was indeed a positive factor, but it was not enough to offset the negative news, such as the gradual concretion of the U.S. loan and its rapid passage through both the U.S. Senate and House of Representatives. Although credit eased last week, the lingering effects of the tight situation that lasted for ten days had not completely dissipated. Additionally, external factors were weak, and other financial goods such as the Hong Kong exchange rate could not rally, so the market generally decreased compared to the end of the previous week, despite the repeated fluctuations during the week. For example, Wing On Company closed at 1790 yuan at the end of the previous week, while the closing price last week was 1655 yuan. The closing price of New Kwong Chong Spinning Mill at the end of last week was almost 20% lower than that of the previous week. Among them, China Silk Corporation closed at the daily limit increase last week, rising about 10% compared to the end of the previous week, which can be considered particularly fortunate. Generally speaking, although Chinese stocks were generally flat or weak last week, the overall trend is still optimistic, as could be seen in the market situation at the weekend.</p>
<p>Although the trend of foreign stocks also fluctuated over the past week, they had exceeded the previous week if comparing the end of the week to the end of the previous week, making the market situation slightly better than that of Chinese stocks. Among the stocks, Jardine Matheson’s strength stood out, rising about 8% at the end of last week compared to the end of the previous week. Generally speaking, it can also be expected to improve with the easing of credit in the future.</p>
<h3>Industrial and Commercial Developments: Raw Cotton Has Not Arrived, Unified Tax is Increased First</h3>
<p>Regarding the solution to the raw cotton shortage, the China Textile Industries Corporation held a board meeting on the 27th of last month to discuss the issue. The conclusion was that to solve the raw cotton supply problem, in addition to intensifying the purchase of domestic cotton, preparations should also be made to order raw cotton from the U.S. aid program. In addition, the association believed that under the current domestic situation, the purchase of domestic cotton is extremely difficult, so exchanging foreign cotton for export yarn and cloth is also a good method. However, it is said that the government originally limited the export of yarn and cloth to 20% of the total national output. The China Textile Industries Corporation specially suggested that if necessary, the export of yarn and cloth could exceed the prescribed limit, requesting the government to relax the scale and approve it at its discretion. The above is the opinion of state-owned yarn factories, representing half of the official view. As for the private cotton textile industry association, it believes that the cotton textile industry is the leader of China's industries, and the government should urgently guide its development and enable it to increase production and directly export. However, due to the worsening situation after the victory and the inappropriate management policies, it has fallen into the current critical situation.</p>
<p>According to the person in charge of the industry, the management policy of yarn and cloth has been changed three times since the victory, but the effect is minimal. He further stated that the current national cotton textile industry does not oppose the method of unified purchase and sales, and commissioned spinning and weaving, but hopes that it can be thoroughly implemented to solve the raw material shortage of various factories. For this reason, cotton textile industry personnel are planning to improve the management of yarn and cloth, and sending representatives to consult with the government. However, the government's consistent strategy has always seemed to not only "support the development of the cotton textile industry," but also attempt to control, or even grasp, civilian materials. On the 27th of last month, the Ministry of Economic Affairs and the National Bank authorities exchanged views on the production and sales of yarn and cloth and management policies for an hour. It is understood that they plan to set up a "Joint Yarn and Cloth Distribution Committee," affiliated with the Ministry of Economic Affairs, and composed of representatives from the Central Bank, the National Textile Federation, the China Textile Industries Corporation, and the six regional cotton textile associations. The committee will set up a business department with three groups: raw materials, export, and domestic sales. The raw materials group will be responsible for the unified purchase of domestic and foreign cotton, and distribute it to various factories according to proportions; the export group will specialize in the export of yarn and cloth, using part of the foreign exchange earned from exports to order foreign cotton and machinery materials, and providing the rest to the Central Bank; the domestic sales group will specialize in the distribution of yarn and cloth throughout the country, and all yarn produced by the factories must be submitted to the committee for allocation. If the committee can be established as scheduled, undoubtedly private textile manufacturers will be completely subordinate to this organization, that is to say, the authorities will completely grasp all the production, transportation, and sales materials and functions of this industrial sector.</p>
<p>Recently, regarding the supply of raw cotton, the person in charge of the Central Bank said that there is no shortage, because it is said that more than 80,000 bales of American cotton will arrive in Shanghai successively in about ten days, which is certainly good news. However, one wave has not subsided, another wave rises. Although the successive arrival of raw cotton has given the textile industry in the city a glimmer of hope, the law that profit tax must be prepaid six times, and the new regulation that the unified cotton yarn tax rate will be increased from 7% to 10% has given the textile industry an intractable problem. Regarding the case of pre-collecting six times the profit tax, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce has appealed to the authorities to find a way to remedy it, but the response was that it was difficult to do so. The six regional cotton textile associations decided on Wednesday of last week to reply to the tax bureau, submitting the difficulties and requesting a change of method. The city's 110 trade associations also jointly signed a telegram to the Ministry of Finance, requesting a change. How this problem will be solved probably depends on the relative strength of both sides.</p>
<p>As for the increase in the unified cotton yarn tax, the cotton textile industry strongly opposes it and issued a written statement, believing that the unified cotton yarn tax was originally levied ad valorem, so the tax paid on yarn prices also increased accordingly. If the tax rate is further increased, the already precarious textile industry will not be able to bear it. The National Textile Federation even telegraphed the Executive Yuan, the Legislative Yuan, and the two ministries of finance and economics, submitting it to the National Government to reconsider the cotton yarn tax increase and withdraw the order. Therefore, whether the tax rate can be increased as scheduled, it is feared that there will be a heated dispute in the future.</p>
