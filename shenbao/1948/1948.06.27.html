<h3>臨時財產稅條例草案　立院小組會討論竣事　遺產稅起征點待院會決定</h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿六日電〕立院財政金融委曾臨時財產稅及淸查豪門資本小組，廿六日午後開會，繼續討論臨時財產稅條例草案，簡貫三主席首由江一平代表外委會推定之三人小組報告研究外人財產課征臨時財產稅之結果，認有事實困難，不易推行。旋開始討論，修正通過七·八兩章「罰則」，「附則」，其要點爲：（一）不依征課程序規定期限申報其財產者，科以應納稅額百分之五十之罰鍰。（二）對其財產虛僞隱匿，意圖逃漏者，除科以應納稅額一倍以上，三倍以下之前罰鍰外，並處一年以上，五年以下有期徒刑。（三）不依課征程序規定期限納稅者，就其所欠稅額，自逾期日起，按旬處以百分之卅罰鍰，逾期滿三月者，强制執行之。全部草案八章討論完畢，復對前次會議保留之營利事業財產凈値之稅率問題加以討論。盧郁文氏於此重提法人不應爲征課對象之議，仍未得出席委員支持，及通過另一修正案，訂明營利事業爲獨資經營或雖非獨資而各股份所有人併該事業股份凈値及其他財產總數達個人納稅標準者，仍應就個人財產征稅。至規定營利事業財產凈値之稅率之條文，是否將因此項新規定而取消或加以訂正，則尙待廿八日該小組再開會時決定。如此財金委會對此案之審查勢難依限於本月底向院會提出報吿，廿九日院會中，該委會將以院會過額審查謹愼之理由，請准寬限數日。</p>
<p>〔本報南京廿六日電〕立法院財政金融委會，經濟資源委會及民法委會廿六日晨舉行聯席會議，王孟鄰主席，審查政院咨送修正遺產稅法草案，對遣產稅之起征點，熱烈討論，原草案規定者爲民國廿六年幣値五萬元，各委員咸認此數額過高，應予抑低，最後以三萬元·兩萬元及一萬元三數額付表決，除贊成一萬元者寥寥外，贊成兩萬者卅人，贊成三萬元者廿九人，均未過在塲委員六十二人之半數，乃決議以此兩數額並提院會決定其一，以爲遺產稅之起征點。</p>

<h3>從教育中體騐民主</h3>
<p>— 高時良</p>
<p>中國現在已跨入民主憲政的途程。檢討此一年來，從選舉國代到立院集會，不知鬧了多少笑話，使我們深深地感覺到，須多向民主國家學習。因此，站在敎育立塲上，培養靑年的民主精神與風度，應列爲中等以上學校的中心訓練，藉以奠定民主政治的基礎。因爲今日的靑年學生，就是將來的政府官吏，議會議員，國民代表和選民，唯其他們都負荷着建立民主國家的使命，所以如何指導他們成爲民主時代忠實的官吏和優秀的公民，確爲今日學校敎師的無可推諉的責任。</p>
<p>我們不能否認，行憲後的大中敎育依然沒有改變以前的錯誤觀念。敎師除了敎書改課卷以外，對於學生的課外活動可以完全不管，要怎樣培養學生的民主生活，始終不爲學校所注意。就是敎育當局對今後學生自治活動應採取何種新的方式與訓練，似乎也未曾加以考慮。這便是今日的中國敎育與生活脫節，不能配合時代需要的癥結所在。</p>
<p>民主生活的訓練，主要的是健全學生自治組織與活動，目前中等學校的學生自治活動，有幾種畸形現象必須立加糾正，第一種是有些終日埋首讀書，對課外活動毫無興趣，每學期開頭雖然也繳會員費，投選舉票，却不曾過問自治會的一切施設，他們際約地還有專制時代那種「日出而作，日入而息，帝力何有於我哉」的幼稚思想。另一稱學生是熱中於領袖慾，具優越感，好像每學期非他們出來，自治會就組織不成，整個自治會全爲他們所控制，小焉者不過出些個人風頭，大焉者則用以威脅學校，鼓動學潮。還有一種學生是各成派別，造成堡壘，黨同伐異，互相攻訐，必使自治會內沒有異己的分子存在，這三種現象都具有激厚的封建色彩，對靑年的心理行爲都有極不良的影響，不容在民主制度下的學校中出現。所以本人以爲指導學生自治組織和活動，應盡量模仿進步的民主國家的政治體制。有政府，有議會，也有法院，各掌行政立法司法監察彈劾之權，并能嚴格執行其職務。各級代表及自治會領袖的產生，亦應以競選方式出之。參加競選人應提出其確能爲學校（國家）爲同學（人民）謀利益的施政綱領，以取得全體同學的擁護；而作爲「選民」的同學，也必須撇開個人感情，對所要選舉的人。具有堅定的自信心和判斷力，眞正做到「選賢與能」的地步。</p>
<p>民主不能離開自由，但自由須有其限度，必須伴以紀律，眞理，和合作精神，必須以國家利益爲前提。歐美各國，有的爲兩黨制，有的爲三然制，有的爲多黨制，然派旣不止一個，但其民主制度能逐漸趨於穩固，是因爲政黨的政策容有不同，而對於立國精神則是一致的。民主國家的一切利益應屬於人民，不能因個人的自由而忽略大衆的利益。英國下議院相沿一句格言：「和大衆有關的事情，必須得大衆的許可。」因格主敎：（W.　R.　Inge）論英國人對於自由平等博愛的態度，說「在這三個口號之中，我們較關心自由，但我們準備在危急的時候犧牲自由的。」英國人此種民主素養，可以說也是由學校中得來。我國的憲法雖已公布，但靑年學生對於民主自由的眞諦，却是一知半解。民主在邏輯上雖不即等於自由，但學校因噎廢食，沒有合理地指導學生去運用自由，認識民主，也是錯誤。本人以爲在不違反國家利益，社會秩序和妨碍學校行政措施的原則下，學校儘可容許學生以思想和行動上的自由，使他們於實際生活中，充分了解民主自由的意義的範疇，而且當他們的思想行爲越出常軌，受到社會和與諭的制裁時，會自然而然地加以警惕，重新檢討自已，這種中實際體騐中得來的敎訓，般富有敎育的意義。</p>
<p>英美各國都非常注意學　運動道德的培養，藉以訓練優良的民主精神，美國普　斯敦大學和耶魯大學的足球賽，事前有個類似誓師的儀式，誓詞稱：「我們祈求勝利，但是我們更祈求保持淸白的動作。」英國人對道戲精神（Sport　Spitit）的定義，是解作「對於對方的勝利，如同自己勝利一樣的欣歡。」英美人在球塲上的精神，常表現於　議塲上，羅斯爾競選勝利，第一張賀電來自競選失敗的成爾基，便是著例。我國各地每一次運動會，都有運動員在吵鬧打架，此次全運會仍不能避免，這種劣根性，也需要學校導師和體育敎員予以矯正。</p>
<p>在我國的現實環境中，許多人懷疑中國是否可以實行民主，然而時代只有向前，沒有倒退，亦在我們能痛下決心，努力以赴。十九世紀末年，曾任英首相之保守黨領袖狄斯奧爾（Disrael）逝世時，自由黨首相格拉斯吞（Gladstone）不特沒有讚揚狄氏的政績，反而諷刺他是忠於猶太種族和太太的人，再溯十九世紀初年。美國傑克遜總統爲了拉攏黨員，應付他們的貪婪要求，竟留下了「分贓制度」的遺毒，那作爲競選口號的「勝者得贓」一語，成爲美國初期的民主制度的汚點。這百餘年來，要不是英美的政治家和敎育家們，努力地來整肅，，來改造，時別是學校中授予嚴格的民主訓練，是不會有此成就的。</p>
<p>優良的學風可以造成優良的政風，優良的民主風範必須從學校中孕育出來。羅素有言：「容讓與常識是心理的習慣，不能寫在憲法中去的」對于培養下一代國民的民主神精和風度，我們不能不對敎育者們寄以厚望了。</p>
<h3>監院第十一次會議通過　劃四十二監察區　情形特殊省分暫緩設監委行署</h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿六日電〕監察院廿六日上午第十一次會議中，原列議程爲討論監委行署組織條例草案，因有孫玉琳，郭昌鶴等卅人之臨時動議一件：「關於行署組織條例第二條之討論，同人等以爲應先行解決實際設署問題，再研討條文，較爲合宜，茲謹擬訂分區設署表一種，擬請先行提付討論，俟有決定，再就決定之情况，研議條文」。經一致同意後，就該動議首予討論，原列行署單位爲卅一個，另辦公室一個，辦事處一個，暫行緩設者兩個，實際待設置之行署爲廿九個，討論時甚爲認眞，以至有相互爭執之情事，根據該案原定之區域爲：河北·天津·北平分設三個行署，但平。津近在咫尺，即已設立兩署，而河北省復另設一署，在地域上說，似有嫌多之感，惟趙光宸乃天津區選出之監委，渠即主張，必須設立三署，以使利工作之進行，郭仲隗當起立大聲疾呼，稱本草案幾經討論審查，三四日來尙無結果，可謂每個人均係就本身利益着想，而不以國家民族利益爲重，以本人言，應少設行署，是時趙光宸立即至發言台稱，現在係民主憲政之時，每人均有發言權，爲何有人來作敎訓，本人不接受敎訓，幸此乃意氣用事，旋即仍進行討論，午前散會時討論未畢。</p>
<p>下午三時半續舉行會議，討論監委行署組織條例，並首就孫玉琳之臨時提案即主張首先解決實際設署問題予以討論，費時甚久，惟終獲全部通過，計決定劃全國爲四十二個監察區，設監委行署，另設辦公室一個，惟其中尙有若干係因礙於匪患暫緩股立者，如東北九省除瀋陽市設立外，餘均暫緩。該提案通過後主席即以組織條例草案第二條關於設立行署地區之規定條文提出討論。徵詢大會意見是否附列於第二條條文之內，當爲若干人所反對，認爲應由監院自己規定，否則送立院後，恐遭修改，當經一致決議，第二條條文修正爲：「監院劃全國爲若干區，每區設監委行署，行署之設立，由全體委員過半數之出席、出席過半數之通過決定之」。旋復有僑胞監委認爲，海外不能設行署，亦應在明文內規定可派員調查，當在第二條內增列第二項「監院對駐外使領館及國營事業機關，得隨時派員調查之」。討論至此，已逾下午六時，當宣布散會，其餘條文，於下次會中再行討論。茲誌分區設署之各單位如次：（一）蘇，（二）皖，（三）贛，（四）湘，（五）鄂漢口市〔設漢口或武昌），（六）浙，（七）閩，（八）台，（九）滇，（十）黔，（十一）川西（設蓉），（十二）川東渝（設渝），（十）（三）西康，（十四）粵穗（設穗），（十）（五）桂，（十六）豫，（十七）魯靑島市（設濟南或靑島），（十八）冀北平市（設北平），（十九）天津，（二十）晋，（二十一）陝省西京市（設西安）（二）（十二）甘，（二十三）靑，（二十四）寗（上三省暫行合設甘靑寗行署），（二十五）新疆，（二十六）熱河，（二十）（七）察哈爾，（二十八）綏遠（上三省暫行合設熱察綏行署），（二十九）遼寗省瀋陽市（設瀋陽），（三十）安東，（三十三）遼北（以上兩省緩設），（三十二）吉林，（三十三）松江有哈爾濱市（緩設），（三十四）合江，（三十五）黑龍江，（三十六）嫩江，（三十七）興安，（三十八）大連市（以上四省一市緩設），（三十九）西藏（緩設），（四十）東蒙（設錦州），（四十一）西蒙（設包頭），（四）（十二）滬市。南京一市在院內設辦公室。</p>

<h3>顆緩性爆炸的原子彈（上）</h3>
<p>— 吳嘉棠</p>
<p>如果你今日游歷東京，訪問民情，你所得之印象，一定是認爲改變日本面目的，不是兩個原子炸彈，而是三枚原子炸彈！第一枚炸彈當然是燬滅廣島的那一個原子彈，落在長崎的是第二枚，第三枚可說是緩性爆炸的原子彈，牠推翻了過去日本全部的社會和政治基礎。這一枚炸彈雖是無聲無　，可是對於日人的影響，却比前兩枚歷史性原子彈更爲深遠而其結果更無可挽回。假使日本的歷史眞能依着盟總所規劃的路綫走，則在廣島和長崎久經重建之後，日本人民仍將深切的感受到第三枚無形原子彈的威力。</p>
<p>作者戰前游歷日本兩次，深知日本人民的性格，但是我最近再度赴日所看到的和過去可說是完全不同的一個國家，而日本人民的一言一動，亦大異於過去。據我看來，今天的日本人深知他們是一個被征服的民族，他們很知道：他們生活的方式及命運完全操於盟總之手。盟總管制日人雖不用過去日本憲兵隊毒辣的手段，然而日本人很能透澈的瞭解他們一舉一動皆在盟軍嚴厲的管制中。</p>
<p>和各色各類的日本人談話後，所得到的最顯著的印象，是日本由盟軍佔領後，一切閃電似的改革，已使一般人民手足無措，呆然若失。他們並不是全體明白這個變化的意義，大多數人只是過一天算一天，茫然不曉得走向何處去。歸國以後，有人問我：日本人是不是眞的變了？我的坦白的答覆是：要根本改變一個民族，必須假以時日，三年實在太短促但是改革日本的基本政策及實施的已經建方式立，並且正在努力的推行。至於在盟總自日本撤退之後，這此改革是否繼續推行，那是中·美·蘇·及其他有關國家的責任。亦有人問我：日本是否可能再成爲中國的軍事威脅？我的看法是：在目前，我國並無恐懼的理由，而在未來的數十年中，軍國主義日本重起的可能性亦甚小，不過我認爲除非國人以最大的努力奮發自强，則即使像暹羅這樣的小國，亦有一天會來凌辱我們的。我們現在沒有理由去畏懼一個解除武裝的日本，却有理由恐懼我們自己不能自奮。</p>
<p>在日本人自己看來，他們的宇宙中的一切的一切都變了。在政府組織之中，天皇制度在新憲法之下，無疑已受到最厲害的演變。裕仁在過去是神的化身，現在則僅是一個普通的公民。在明治憲法下，天皇是帝國神聖不可侵犯的領袖，掌握國家主權和立法大權，是海陸軍的最高統帥，對外有　戰媾和和締取條約之權。可是在今日，裕仁的權力已被剝奪無遺，他甚至於還比不上，英皇在英國名義元首的地位。新憲法已經把主權賦與日本人民，裕仁之權利義務與其他公民無異。立法大權是操在國會手裏，裕仁不能再像過去那樣，經過國會利御前會議的同意而成立法案。新憲法頒佈後通過的法案是法律，而不再是過去的御諭了。</p>
<p>熟知日本和有歷史知識的人，一定會明瞭這種變化對日本人民的深遠意義，我認爲日皇地位的演變已經使他在日本政治舞台上成了不足輕重的問題了。我在東京的時候，謠言流傳，說裕仁要讓位。有人吿訴我：裕仁確是這樣想法，而且幾乎決定要退位。事實上，以他今日的地位而論，這個問題在政治上不是一個主要問題，因為每例日本人都知道：只要盟總稍稍暗示裕仁應該退位的話，天皇制度就即刻會變成日本的歷史名字。</p>
<p>我至今還記得民國卅三年到東京的時候，日本人民如何在皇宮前俯首鞠躬的情景。但是在這次再到東京，我看到許多小孩子在皇宮正門前的大道上打壘球。這個有意義的鏡頭，亦足以證明日本人民在生活上，心理上的演變。</p>

<p>〔路透社華沙廿五日電〕參加東歐八國外長會議之各國代表，已於今日自華沙啓程各返本國，莫洛托夫已於廿五日晚安抵莫斯科，據外長克里曼蒂斯已返普拉格，即夜在普拉格電台發表廣播演說，八國外長會之公報雖要求設立全德臨時政府，但此間非正式方面仍盛傳蘇聯將設立東德國，總部設在萊比錫。</p>
<p>此間觀察家相信，東歐外長可以確信其業已擬具採取政治及宣傳行動之計劃，以對付西方强國之担絕重開四强德國問題之談判。想此次大規模會議之召集，決非僅在起草昨夜發表之公報，就公報之含義觀，可能獲得兩種解釋。公報之堅持要求獲致整個德國之協議，不失爲一種企圖以重開四强基礎的談判，此其一；不然此不過爲一種初步行動，使輿論得有準備，以接受日後關於東德之新措施，此其二。如西方强國允諾重開四强談判，則其關於西德的計劃，勢必暫時擱置，使蘇聯得有充分時間以進行其東德之計劃。如西方强國拒絕恢復四强討論，則東歐之宣傳機構即將展開攻勢，譴責西方國家分裂德國。觀察家確信八國會議公報宣布之五點，在掩飾此次會談眞正的性質，設立東德政府必爲會中主要議題之一。</p>

<p>〔聯合社柏林廿六日電〕柏林市府，昨通過決議，請蘇聯及西方盟國當局准許東西馬克在柏林四區自由流通，目前東德馬克已可在柏林西區自由流通，故該項請求其賣祗爲請蘇當局准許西德馬克在柏林蘇聯區自由流通。又蘇聯當局發行之東德馬克，發現偽券甚多，因此已刺激黑市物價之上漲。</p>

<h3>美共和黨總統候選人　杜威演辭全文　—以各種和平方法建立世界秩序</h3>
<p>〔美國新聞處費城廿五日電〕紐約州長杜威星期四晚上於接受共和黨提名爲總統候選人之時，要求「以各稱和平方法努力在公理與正義之基礎上，建立一世界之秩序。」當杜威步入大會堂之時，各代表及旁總人歡呼似雷。</p>
<p>杜威接受總統候選人之演辭全文如下：</p>
<p>「我承諸位共和黨打賭青睞，再度推舉我做美國總統的候選人，這樣的友誼和信任，使我心中非常感謝。同時我灤切感到這個責任的重大。我接受諸位的提名。我以卑謙的心理，祈求上帝，使我應得到這個爲國服務的機會。</p>
<p>我來到諸位面前，不受任何一個義務或諾言的束縛，自由與諸位共同選擇國內最優秀的男女，爲國家服務，自由聯合我黨與我國，以應付我們這一時代的嚴重挑戰。</p>
<p>我們聯合一致，以深切的諒解和廣大的精神，便能應付這個挑戰，這種聯合是超出互控的，超出黨派的，超出自私的。這些美國之偉大所以形成之信條。我們的民族極欲再看到這種信念的力量。他們把這種信念放在我們民族生活的心中，這是我們所要做的，也是我們將要做的。</p>
<p>在這個歷史性的大會中，放在諸位面前的還有其他六位參加總統候選人的競選者，他們都是思想崇高，品性優良，富有才幹和忠誠爲國的人：參議員鮑爾溫，麥克阿（瑟元帥，州長史泰遜，參議員塔虎脫，參議員范登堡和州長華倫。這是一種光榮的競爭中困難的選擇。這是我們共和黨生命，活力和理想的動人表現。</p>
<p>我們的競選是誠賞的，有熱烈的異議和激烈的辯論。但勿讓任何一人誤會。諸位已顯出動人的證據，證明美國人雖然意見彼此或有不同，但都是爲了國家的福利而駢肩向前邁進。</p>
<p>吾當前的責任和機會，乃是自由政府歷史上最大的。因爲在今夜，我們的將來—我們的和平，我們的繁榮以及自由本身的命運懸於危急的未定之天。</p>
<p>僅僅在競選中獲勝，並不是我們的工作或者我們的目的。我們的工作，乃在使我們的勝利充滿這種意味，藉使世界各地渴望自由的人類將獲得勇氣，向前邁進，走出這個失望的黑暗而進入自由的光明境界。</p>
<p>我們的政綱宣佈了種種路標，將指導我們在一個恐怖世界中的堅定的努力。這個輝煌的有關原則的聲明，簡明而切要。</p>
<p>諸位一致加以採納，本人予以一致支持，深感自矜。這是我將帶給全國的消息之中心，一月二十日之後，這將是我們共和黨政府的柱石。</p>
<p>我們是一個團結的政黨，我們的國家亟需同樣的團結。</p>
<p>我國人民正在背棄分離我們的這些較卑鄙的東西。他們渴望走向更高尙的立塲，在使我們團結一致的這些較好的事物中，我尋一個共同目的。我們必須是賞現這種理想的工具。我們必須使美國的力量充份發揮，而使動盪不定的將來重新充滿機會。這是我們的保證。這將是我們勝利的果賞。</p>
<p>假如這種團結要予以獲得並加保持，這需要很大的幅度。它的界限必須超越政治。假如各地自由人能使這種團結成爲他們的共同目標，自由始能得救—也是得救的唯一辦法。</p>
<p>這樣的團結必和和平的主要柱石。犧牲自由而獲得的和平代價太大，這樣的和平是不能持久的，在其他一切目的之上，我們必須以一切和平方法，努力樹立一個以正義爲基礎的世界秩序。這種世界將獲致和平。這種和卒是値得獲得的。這是我國人民加予我們身上的最大責任。這是我們準備獻身的最大任務。</p>
<p>我們所尋求的團結是超過物質的，這超過事物和辦法。這大部份是精神的。我們的問題並不在我們本身之外，我們的問題是在我們本身之內。</p>
<p>在物質方面，我們已經　得使仳界爆裂開來的方法。在精神方面，我們尙須去尋求方法，以謀把世界分裂的散片接合起來，包紥文明的創傷，創造一個由富有善意的人所組成的良好社會，而使我們的美夢終獲實現。我們已經替新的世界設計了高貴的計劃，假如沒有一種新的精神，我們最高貴的計劃亦將毫無意義。我們祈求在未來的時日中，我們將充份具有這種精神。</p>
<p>下屆總統任中將看到二十世紀上半世紀的結束。截至目前爲止，這個世紀是一個充滿驚人進步亦可怕悲劇的世紀。我們看到世界已經改變，我們看到人類爲反抗自然而作的久長鬥爭已獲有異常的成功。。然而，因爲在人類企求在和平，安全與諒解中遭遇到慘敗，所以我們勝利已罩上了黑暗的影子。在這二十世紀進步的時代，已遭遇到二次可怖的戰爭，而在這兩次戰爭之間，又有人類歷史中最嚴重的經濟不景氣。</p>
<p>我們必須學習做好一些。現在將近過世的時代是一種科學成就的時代。以後在我們面前展開的，必須是一個人類精神成就的時代。</p>
<p>我們建議繼續延續我們這一時代在工藝方面所有的偉大成就。我們應當利用原子能各種不可思議的可能性，使男子和婦女都能有一個更偉大與更充實的生活。我們必須集中人類所有的一切精力，智力和決心，專心一志於我們的任務，我們必須解決建立世界永久和平的問題，並爲我們自己的人民及其他同樣思想的人民，獲取自由和機會的幸福。</p>
<p>在我看來，一個人在這個時代要想做一個共和黨黨員，必須致力於人類的自由。在這世界一半自由和一半奴隸的時期內，我們必須和平地工作，協助各處人民獲得自由。</p>
<p>我們已決定我們的目標在於一個强大和自由的美國，一個自由人類的自由世界—自由發表意見，自由發表新的思想，自由出版，自由移動，自由畢業，自由運用勞力的結果，自由崇拜上帝，每個人照他自己對於上帝的恩賜和慈悲所抱的觀念。</p>
<p>當這些權利在世界上確定的時候，共和黨的永久理想也就實現了。</p>
<p>美國人民的理想就是共和黨的理想。我們在這裏費勁德爾斐亞我們自己獨立的搖籃中，已燃起了一個烽火。我們燃起這個烽火，予人類以永遠的希望，使人類在自由中生活，有人類的尊嚴，並在上帝面前以敬愛上帝的姿態，自由直立。」</p>

<h3>普查倉庫　三家囤積嫌疑</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕警局昨起普遍檢查倉庫，自上午十時至午後五時，聞已查獲有囤積物資嫌疑者三家，詳情明日可望發表。</p>
<h3>管制物資嚴防囤積　當局決定緊急措置　令必需品業倉庫業申報交易堆貨情形　今起憑準購證糴米每升價不超過十萬</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕日來物價空前狂漲，吳市長特於昨日下午二時，召集各關係方面，舉行臨時緊急會議，商討應急措置。散會後，吳市長當於三時四十五分，至市參議會向各參議員報告，略稱：日來物價飛漲，個人職責所在，深感慚愧。昨日物價彼動，驚心動魄，即晚與民調會及社會局商討加配食米辦法，決定自今日起，除原有之配米證外，市民得　另聯准購證，每證購米一市升，每升價不得超過十萬元，儘六月底前，向各米店糴買。又今日（廿六日）邀集各關係方面首長潘議長，宣鑯吾，方治，吳開先，俞鴻鈞，劉攻芸等會談結果，決定緊急措施四項：（一）分令日用必需品各業公會（包括糧食，雜糧，花，紗，布，食油，燃料，紙張，食糖等），在三日內，將本月五日至報日止，所有交易詳細情形，從實申報。目的：（甲）買賣雙方，是否業中人。（乙）有無囤積嫌疑。（二）分今各倉庫業公會，申報各戶堆貨情形，堆貨開始日期。目的：（甲）有無業外人堆存貨物。（乙）堆存日期，是否超過當局規定時間。（三）請金管局會同社會局，央行稽核處等，嚴密監視票交換所票據流情形，將調查有無利用票據，作非法之交易者。（四）紗布市況，因各廠咸有存棉不足之恐懼心理，致有波動。惟查目前滬存棉有十五萬包，除紡織品外銷會存有五萬七千包外，美援中亦有外棉九萬所撥到，一俟手續辦妥，即可配出，故存棉無處匱乏。又會議決定，對日來物價狂漲，如查有投機，操縱，囤積之罪嫌者，必呈請中央從嚴懲處。現擬請各位參議員，提供要妥善之辦法。</p>

<h3>參議六次大會　展開財產稅論戰　激辯三小時　褒貶無結論</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕市參議會第六决大會，昨舉行第四决會議。會中對立法院討論徵收財產稅一案，展開熱烈論戰，前後逾三小時，發言參議員達二十人，對此案褒貶參半，至法定散會時間，仍無法獲具結論，而出席之參議員，又陸續退席，已不足法定人數，無法表決，乃決定延至五次會議時續行商討解決。</p>
<p>昨日會議開始，潘議長介紹吳市長報告應付波動之緊急措置後，即開始討論各組審查提案意見。議程預定討論民政組提案共三號，財政組提案共十三號，公用組提案共二十號。</p>
<p>民政部份</p>
<p>通過二案：（一）擬請市府切實保障地方自治人員，不得任意拘捕，並加强各區自治單位，與各區市府附屬單位之聯繫，以收　作效能。（二）提請再電中央將諸翟半鎭誤劃省轄，重行勘定，以符行憲政府尊重民意，推行新政。又保甲長同爲公務人員，應有實物配給權利一案，議決送請民政局研究。</p>
<p>財政部份</p>
<p>通過二案，保留二案後，至第五案財產稅時，即引起冗長之論戰。通過二案爲（一）由本會迅函市府轉咨金管局，即予廢止客戶票據不得當日抵用辦法。（二）急電中央迅將國人逃避在國外之資金及存款，暫時移作準備金，立即改革幣制，以鞏金融而安民心。</p>
<p>財產稅案兩種主張</p>
<p>關於開徵財產稅之提案，原有性質相同主（一）何成甫提陳張相反之兩案，公達等二十人連署者，主張電請本市立委嚴正支持征收臨時財產稅，以平均社會財富而救危亡。（二）王子揚等五十四人合提：電請立院罷議徵收財產稅，並即速制定淸查豪富資本法案，以安定人心，平衡財富案。經召開審查會議結果，併成第二案一併提出，擬請大會電呈立法院：（）罷議徵收財產稅，（二）從速另行制定淸查豪當炎本法案，責令登記財產，加以車徵。</p>
<p>該案提出討論時，支持財產稅之提案人何成甫首先提出請審查會議召集人王延松解釋併案理由後，論戰開始。參加辯論者先後有何成甫，嚴諤聲，范錫品，張志韓，姜豪，費樹聲，陳公達，徐　　，瞿鉞，范守淵，徐永祚，張中原，處舜，趙仰雄，江浩然，部永生，楊撫生等。茲將褒貶雙方意見要點，歸納如决：</p>
<p>主張罷議</p>
<p>徵收財產稅者，認爲（一）財產稅起微數額爲三百億元，以目前通貨膨脹之速，再過數月，每人所有之財產，均將成爲徵收之對象。（二）眞正豪富，資產早已逃至國外。即在國內者，亦以所藏者爲黃金外幣，隱匿甚易。結果，惟有工商業無可掩飾之貨物，設備，機器，廠屋，輪船，車輛等，不得不從實申報，依例納稅，勢必變賣平日賴以用轉運川之貨物原料，　致　產。（三）開徵財產稅，勢將造成資本之大逃避，大者高飛遠走，小者投機金鈔。（四）財產稅條例草案，雖規定中華民國人民在國外，非中華民國人民在國內，所有不動產及動產，一律徵收條文，事實難辦。（五）政府並未提出開征財產稅，僅由若干立委提出。（六）騷擾大多數人之稅爲惡稅，當無成立之必要。（七）政府原有七八種稅法，應先研究如何加强徵收，於平衡收支當更助益。故開徵財產稅，豐非當前之急。</p>
<p>支持開徵</p>
<p>財產稅者，認爲（一）八年抗戰，繼以內亂，國民生活，早失均衡，惟有使大家有衣有食，有錢出錢，有力出力，方足挽時局狂瀾於旣倒。（二）該案爲第一任民選之立委提出，似不應以地方參議會之立塲，任意提請罷議。（三）臨時財產稅爲配合戡亂政策而來，如請罷議，無異認爲戡亂政策，已無此必要。（四）工商界不必杞憂，蓋財產稅係屬普遍開徵，豪富並不例外。且開徵前，必須經過調查申報等手續，決不致故意摧殘工商業。</p>
<p>折衷意見</p>
<p>有（一）望谷參議員返回所代表之各區，對開徵財產稅一事普遍徵求各選民意見，然後彙報到會，以視民意如何爲斷。（二）將今日主張支持及罷議財產稅之各項意見，盡行組錄在卷，同時由參會舉行普遍民意測騐，彙總後提供立院參考。（三）立院對此案迄未作原則之通過，仍在小組審查中，不妨暫不表示意見，以視發展。（四）不妨修改原提案措詞，以在不妨碍正當工商業生存之條件下，開徵財產稅。</p>

<h3>指數物價　脫離過遠　有關各方明日開會　商計指數編製問題</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕本市總工會前要求社會局對於生活指數，應半個月發表一决，記者昨訪吳局長叩詢其意見，據吳局長稱：當此物價瘋在上漲之際，職工生活當深感困苦，總工會要求每半月公布生活指數一决，俾半月發給薪工時有所依據，此項要求尙屬合理。惟有一點困難，即半月發表一决，肚局統計室人手不敷，約需增加二分之一人員，因限於經濟，屆時擬請總工會方面編製指數人員協助。至半月公佈一决在技術上有無困難，則定於二十八日在社會局開會，由市府統計長張宗孟，社會局，暨總工會統計室，會商決定，如原則通過，則定於下月起開始實行。</p>
<p>共體時艱　同渡難關</p>
<p>記者又以此問題，就詢於參議員王先靑，據談設下月倍數過少，則一般工人，職員將無法維持其最低生活，設所增過多，則工廠又有難以生存之危險，故編製指數之機關，賞有加以縝密研究，妥善擬訂之必要。惟渠認爲際此嚴重階段，實已無勞方與資方之分，最要者厥唯雙方合作，共體時艱，同渡難關。總工會常務理事葉翔皋則表示當局對生活必需品之配給，應從速切實辦理。</p>
<p>應速設法抑平物價</p>
<p>旋總工會理事長水祥雲亦語記者稱：工資採取生活指數計算純係求得工資與物價不致脫節，使一般工人獲得一公平合理生活之方法，實行以來，收效甚著，勞資糾紛已不斷减少，惟最近一·二月來物價已至瘋狂境界，日來甚至一日數變，在此狀况下，欲以生活指數計算工資，實已無法可施，即使指數倍數增多，對工廠固屬不利，而就工人本身言，實亦未始爲福，蓋根本問題即物價之壓抑無適當辦法，則前途實有不堪設想之處，工資與物價脫離過遠，不僅工人生計發生問題，引起不斷之勞資糾紛，而社會秩序治安亦必將招致廠車影響也。渠個人認爲治太辦法，即爲政府從速作一緊急措施，壓平物價，同時在編製指數方面，亦應重作家計調查，並提高品質與權數。渠稱明日上午九時各有關方面將假社會局對此一問題，詳加研討，俾獲一適當之解決辦法。</p>
<h3>飛機調整運價　交部尚未批覆　輪船漲價延至廿九起實行</h3>
<p>民航公司要求調整運價事，交通部尙未批覆。據中國中央二公司負責人稱，民航運價之調整，以用油及職工生活指數爲主要因素，政府如能穩定油價及生活指數，則民航運價始能維持不增。據悉：交部對民航公司要求調整百分之一百八十九之運價，將稍予减低。又船聯會前議決所有各綫客貨運一律調整百分之八十，並議定本月二十八日起實行，茲因交部尙未答復，漲價手續亦因時間短促而不及辦理，故決定延至二十九日起賞行。</p>
<h3>自動交通燈　南京西路先裝試用</h3>
<p>傳聞已久之自動交通管制燈，即將在本市裝置應用，交通當局鑒於市中區車馬輻輳，擁擠不堪，尤其手推車，三輪車，人力車，頗多不守交通規則，一旦採用自動交通燈後，是項車輛之自由行駛，可能引起不良秩序，爲期增加市民認識，及車輛瞭解管制辦法起見，擬將預定裝設各燈，移裝南京西路試用，第一期擬在迪化北路至陝西北路，計劃裝置於迪化北路，華山路，常德路，銅仁路，陝西北路等五處，該自動交通燈分紅黃綠三種信號，黃燈對正在前進車輛，其未超過路口停車綫，應一律禁止前進，已超過者可繼續進行。</p>

<h3>全滬電影觀衆　每月有四百萬　悲苦刺激五彩片最受歡迎</h3>
<p>〔本報特寫」在都市裏，看電影是一種最普遍化的娛樂，電影院在各種娛樂事業中，擁有最多的顧客。</p>
<p>上海市區內原來共有四十七家電影院，其中九星一家現在改演滬劇，所以祇剩了四十六家，計頭輪二十二家，二輪五家，三輪十五家，四輪四家，座位最多的是大光明，有一千九百五十一只，最少的是平安，僅五百只。</p>
<p>頭輪影院在戰後增加了不少，這是一種畸形的現象。戰前的頭輪戲院是以地點與設備爲標準，現在則凡是能取得影片首映權的都升格爲頭輪，所以除了幾家「老牌」頭輪外，現在一般所謂頭輪影院的設備，都已够不上水準了。</p>
<p>全市電影觀衆的人數，約略有多少呢？四十六家電影院的座位總數共四萬餘只，一天開映四塲，如果塲塲客滿，每天的觀衆有十八萬多人，一個月就有五百多萬人，實際上這數字大約要打一個七折至八折，如五月份的統計，全市各電影院的觀衆八數約近四百萬人，其中幾家第一流電影院的觀衆統計如下：大光明十九萬九千人，皇后十四萬七千九百人，美琪十四萬六千人，黃金十二萬人，大上海十一萬六千人，大華十一萬一千五百人，滬光十萬零八千五百人，國泰十萬零三千二百人。</p>
<p>不同的影片擁有不同的觀衆。以一般來說，國片的顧客大都喜歡情節悲苦動人，所以「八年離亂」與「天亮前後」列爲賣座最好的片子，其他凡是「苦」的片子大抵都能投人所好。西片則以五彩及刺激性的動作片最受歡迎，如埃洛茀林的「反攻緬甸」，伊漱惠廉絲的「出水芙蓉」及瑰麗神怪的「一千零一夜」等，都曾一映再映，歷久不衰。</p>
<p>影院片商合夥性質</p>
<p>電影院放映的影片全靠影片商供給。影院與片商可謂是合夥性質，前者有的是戲院，後者有的是片子。電影院以設備及地點來吸引片商的乘靑，片商則以其出品來號召影院，並力選迎合上海觀衆需求的影片，所以有的在美國紅極一時的明星未必在中國也能走紅，反之在中國營業特盛的影片在本國未必便是四星或五星影片。</p>
<p>歷來各影院一年中所映的影片，都在上一年的年終就與片商預先訂定。每張合同約爲二三十部影片，內中往往還夾雜幾部特別足以號召或攝製成本特別鉅大的佳片，規定須「特價放映」，如過去大光明國泰同時放映的「海底肉彈」便是一例。</p>
<p>映期長短全看賣座</p>
<p>每一張影片映期的長短是以觀衆數量爲定的，院方與片商歷來規定在每片觀衆跌進百分之五十以內時才另行換片。例如影院有一千只座位，日映四塲，座位總數即爲四千只。每日觀衆如果在二千人以上則此片就得一直放映下去。不過有時在欲罷不休或新片渦積的狀况下也可以情商停映。爲要避免這種情形，常常就有幾家影院同映一片的情形，這也是造成今日頭輪影院濫竿充數的一大原因。</p>
<p>片商與影院訂定合同後，就將片子陸續交給影院放映，影院取得片子時不必付款與片商，而是在放映的收入中除去娛樂稅印花稅外，餘雙雙方平均分派。例如三十萬元的票價，娛樂稅百分之二十是六萬元，印花稅百分之五是一萬二千元，餘數片商與影院各得十一萬四千元，六萬元的票價，娛樂稅一萬二千元，印花稅二千四百元，餘　片商與影院各得二萬二千八百元，其中影院方面還得支付營業稅·牌照稅·所得稅·利得稅·建設捐等等稅捐。</p>
<p>因爲放映的收入平均分攤，所以雙方對於收入數字非常關切，片商方面時常派人監查影院的營業狀况，對於票價的調整尤其積極主張·不論是中西片商，由於國幣貶値，成本鉅大，都是希望票價最好能節節提高。</p>
<p>開支激增叫苦連天</p>
<p>影院方面也有許許多多苦處：百物飛漲，開支激增，電影票價跟不上其他物價，看白戲的多，更常常有「元妄之災。」有一决一家電影院的經理被警局傳去拘押了一天，原因是在影院內查獲有人吸烟，有人吃帶殼皮的東西，影院經理應負其責。但事實上院方除了懸掛「不准吸烟」的標記外，根本無執行禁令的權限。像這一類的代人受罪，無怪他們要呌屈了。</p>
<p>最近社會局規定頭輪電影院的座位中以百分之三十為限價座，這對於大多數市民固然是德政，但二三四輪影院却呌苦連天了，因爲全市影院四萬餘座位中，頭輪有二萬七千餘只，百分之三十限價座爲八千餘只，幾佔全部二三四輪影院座位的百分之四十二，化同樣的代價大家都趨向到頭輪影院去，二三四輪的營業因此大受影響了。</p>

<h3>物價漲勢有增無已　食糧市塲暫時停業　白粳門售每担二千二百萬元</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕昨日本市之物價漲勢，仍未見緩和。白米門售事實上已達每担二千二百萬，日用品之零售價格，亦節節上升。黑市金鈔價格與前日相彷彿，股票十一種則於上午十時左心又吿漲停板。</p>
<p>市政當局爲阻止物價漲風起見，昨日商請米·油·雜糧·麵粉·四業之經紀人退出市塲，因當局發覺經紀人代業外人士之賣買，對物價有推波助瀾之作用；四業之經紀人表示接受，故昨日四業市塲均告停市，明日是否照常交易，悉聽市府經濟會報決定。一面公吿市民，得　六月份民調會所發之食米准購證，向各該區計口售米米店每證購食米一市升，價格不得超過十萬元。並由米店在准購證上註明購米人保甲及姓名住址，以便稽考。</p>
<p>按兩日來漲風之起，原因不一，但以戰局逆轉及游資南來爲主因，故如何緩和漲風，亦應自治本方面入手；因市塲人心兩日來浮動已極，枝節之治標辦法，難期收效。</p>
<h3>塲外亦無交易</h3>
<p>又訊：昨日米市，因大批經濟警察，至南北二市塲監視交易，是以貨主皆不敢出樣喊價，同時社會局暗中通知市塲暫停交易，故昨無交易。未至十時半，同業已相繼離去。民調會昨照常供應拋出，數量及價格均無變動。雜糧，食油，麵粉市場，均由社局通知停止交易一天，故未至十一時，人已散去，交易毫無做開。即塲外交易，亦以無人肯售出而未開。手持現款之買戶，不得其貨而買，門售白粳高貨絕跡。中貨每石二千萬，低貸一千八百萬，且每人祗能購一升二升。麵粉門售五八〇萬（兵船粉），豆油每斤五十二萬，生油六十萬，多購尙屬不易。</p>
<h3>上塲多開高盤　華股繼續暴騰</h3>

<p>外股　昨集會地址有警務當局干涉，行動不便，交易較難正常展開，怡紗自新高價一四五〇萬起，退至一三〇〇萬結束。較前收計怡紗英聯紙版怡　航業鋼業各漲一成光景，會德豐升半成，業廣所升不多。</p>
<p>又訊：六月三十日上午，短期國庫券照常開做，但二十九日及三十日兩後市如何，未見明確公吿。</p>
<h3>各地商情</h3>

<p>鎮江　〔本報鎭江二十六日電〕鎭物價今又緊隨滬市狂漲，食糧豆油紗布五洋百貨漲風之厲，駭人聽聞。糙米售一七五〇萬，熟米已隱匿一空，購者雖出二子萬高價，亦不易求得。成餘地球等牌麵粉絕跡，每袋漲至六百萬，綠金山粉廠盤開五四五萬，小麥一二〇〇萬，香烟肥皂全日計報漲七次，入晚棉紗號及香烟號多提早打烊，市塲混亂情况堪稱空前。</p>
<p>常熟　〔本報常熟廿六日電〕此間物價，今日賡續狂跳，縣當局除電令嚴防搶米風潮外，並舉行平糶，以維民食。計開白粳一七八〇萬，小麥一一八〇萬，菜子一七一萬，廠餅八二〇萬，特號粉五五〇萬，棉紗無市，五洋西藥一致上升。</p>

<p>杭州</p>
<p>〔本報杭州廿六日電〕物價連日劇挺，民心浮動，杭市區米店昨日有兩起發生紛擾，經軍　鎭壓平息，省市當局爲防止搶米風潮，於昨夜起臨時戒備，各食糧倉庫及重要馬路均加駐軍警，以防意外，並由市民調會拋售食米一千石，糧行拋售二千石，門售限價每担一四〇〇萬，市塲較趨穩定。周市長召集各糧商作緊急談話，勸令勿高抬糧價，以免意外。部份米店已拆卸玻璃窗，預作準備。</p>
<p>北平</p>

<h3>昨晚籃球賽　世運小勝警星　緊張出於意外　六十三比五十三分</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕世運籃球隊昨夕以六十三比五十三擊敗警星，完成征滬之第五次勝利。上半時廿四比廿三，世運多一分。警星雖竭雜全力，負隅頑抗，且曾三度以一分領前，終以技藝略遜，屈盟城下。相差分數，除最後數分鐘外，始終在二三球之間，警星已盡最大努力，世運表演，則未見若何出色。</p>
<p>七時半，兪菊盧誤卯，由王基思與劉荷生執法。世運以大李，阿包充衛，文華中鋒，余進世僑輔弼左右。警星則以吳新運，徐仲已，傳其俠，王蓉生，及姚文彝迎戰。阿包兩罰，文華遠射，四比〇世運佔先。警星急起直追，八比七相差一分。小吳再接再厲，單刀直入，十三比十二警星首次領前。阿弟替出余進，雙方演成拉鋸，廿一比二十，警星二次佔光。分數兎起　落，緊張出人意表，上半時廿四比廿三，世運半球佔先。</p>

<h3>世界拳王爭霸戰　喬路易依舊稱雄　第十一回合擊倒華爾谷</h3>
<p>〔聯合社紐約廿五日電〕重量級拳擊冠軍喬路易與挑戰者華爾谷，今夜在洋基拳塲舉行錦標賽，觀衆五萬人，大戰預定十五回合，喬氏在第十一回合中擊倒敵手，保持皇座。拳王喬路易今夜擊敗華爾谷後，宣布退休，據稱：「爲母命起見，今夜爲我最後一次比賽。」</p>
<p>〔合衆社紐約廿五日電〕世界重量級拳擊冠軍喬路易，廿五日晚在第十一回合中，擊倒其挑戰者華爾谷於楊基運動塲中，保持其王座，路易於勝利後，立即宣佈退休。</p>
<p>第十一回合開始二分五十二秒後，路易擊倒其黑人對手，按拳王自擊敗勃拉道克贏得世界錦標後，迄今作衛冕戰廿五次，戰無不利，此次大戰，開始十個回合，戰局平淡沈悶，僅在第三回合中，路易被猛擊倒地，纔計三下，又一躍而起，恢復作戰，較爲可觀。時至第十一回合，衆以爲華爾谷表演出色，分數遠較路易爲多，當可取勝，不意拳王右拳重敲，華爾谷不支踣地，遂吿失敗。今日之戰過程沈悶，與兩年前路易迎戰皮萊康一役，若同一轍，而兩戰結果之迅速，亦出人意外。</p>
<p>路易擊倒對手前，華爾谷右重拳擊中路易頭部，拳王似有不支之態，然後兩人短兵互擊，路易左鈎拳擊傷華爾谷，後者且跌仆繩上，於是兩個卅四歲黑人拳手，你來我往，褐色轟炸機左手鈎中，「傑賽」老華搖搖欲墮，路易右手再敲一記，華爾谷斜步跌倒帆布台上，背部向天，偃伏三秒鐘後，華爾谷手膝幷撑，企圖起立，沿台前爬，意欲立直兩脚，裁判員計數至十，老華雖已一膝離地，惟仍無法立起，遂吿失敗。</p>
<p>路華兩人去年十二月五日初逢於此間馬迪森方塲國中，華爾谷一鳴驚人，接連擊翻喬路易兩次。路易雖因積分優勝而裁判拳證三人，意見並不一致。</p>
<p>第三回合中，老華右拳旋中路易下顎，轟炸機竟然倒地，隨即一躍而起，似未受創，立刻開始緊迫對手。</p>
<p>擊倒前，兩人勢均力敵，不分勝負，合衆社記分表上註明兩人各勝四回合，平手兩回合。門票收入約七十萬元，路易分得四成，約三十七萬元，華爾谷拆得二成，約爲路易所入之半數。</p>

<p>編輯先生：年來本市公用事業在市公用局孹劃經營之下，成績斐然，市民稱便。惜市渡輪一項，獨不見改善。如渡客最擁擠之東東綫（東門路—東昌路），每天七時以後，只有單輪行駛，而是時適值工廠下工，辦公下班，小職員還家之際。乘客擁擠不堪，而脫班者須等候半小時之久，此輩精疲力竭之職員工人，亟需返家休息，鵠立碼頭，豈不心焦。又因輪小客多，擁擠不堪，宵小之徒，乘機橫行，抑尤甚者，即載重過度，安全至為可慮，至於船燈昏暗，秩序紛亂等，更屬餘事矣。茲懇借貴報一角籲請公司當局加以改善，為市民謀福利。特陳鄙見如后：（一）輪渡時間應延長至下午十二時為止。（二）經常應以兩艘對渡，以免載重過量。（三）應改善船上照明設備，以免宵小橫行。（四）在碼頭設意見箱，俾市民隨時貢獻意見。（五）班次應改為十分鐘一次，俾可多渡旅客，避免擁擠。（六）改善碼頭管理，注意渡客安全</p>
<p>浦東居民顧可權等同上</p>

<h3>買書隨感錄</h3>
<p>— 白永</p>
<p>無論別的東西怎樣貴，對於我好像全是次要，因爲生活程度可以儘量壓低，—何况根本慾望就不高。只有書價一漲，　於我的壓迫特別大。一個有特別嗜好的人，可以把所好的東西看得比衣食還重要，典衣貰酒，何嘗不是這個意思。自然有人會罵，到底是肚皮吃飽了，才說出這種話，然而對於生活趣味，但有一分能够滿足，恐怕誰也不願犧牲。專門做消化糧食的機器，總是不大好受的。古人所說博奕猶賢乎已，蓋亦深有所慨而言也。</p>
<p>讀畫就代表我吃香烟，夜讀更可以看做吃老酒。有人喜歡吃雪茄或白乾，好比讀書喜愛賈誼渦秦論與辛稼籽的詞，非痛哭流涕不行。但我則速纏綿俳惻的也讀不進，我簡直怕透了空論與不能了解的喜怒悲歡，沒有別人那麼多推想的能力，可以揣知關西大漢與十七八女郞拍紅牙板的味兒，老實人只求了解一點眞實，無如歷史又是專門扯謊騙人的東西，於是從零碎事物上一點一滴的來看，假使能够把還許多珍珠穿起來，也未嘗不可價逾連城，可惜我們隊伍中，能够創通義例給人以整體印象者又殊不多。不妨彷　人的口氣嘆一聲：「甚矣哉讀書之難也！」</p>
<p>午倦書拋，意境固然很好，但一有職業，即碍難北窗高臥，所以不等書拋，早已加急入夢。還有一層，一間房子頂一根金條，要想明窗凈几一人獨享佳趣，亦復等之幻想，大家興趣不齊，你要看書他偏聽無綫電，要不然客人來了，過得你非流亡不可，都比催和敗興還要命，只有十點鐘以後，大家上了床，世界完全成爲自我管領，寗可不滅電燈，犧牲一點別人睡覺的時間，大致可得兩個鐘頭的暢讀，所謂情味醇醇，眞好似吃醉了老酒，直到邯鄲道上，還在繼續映演書中故事人物。</p>
<p>前些時，商務印書館大廉價，平常看了書價倒吸一口冷氣的我們，好似奉了赦律，然而，像買配給物資一樣，我們照樣軋不到頭一份，大淸早九點鐘以前就有若干人排在鋮門之外，等候「別苗頭」了。幸而我不大買小說之類，受的影響還小，可是，我在河南路附近的許多舊書店裏，已竟發現了許多敲着梅花圖章的廉價書了，原價標簽扯去或揩去，依樣寫上驚人的價錢！譬如馮承鈞譯的多桑蒙古史，頭幾天據說很多，後來就一本不見，全被他們掏去了，這也可以呌做流入黑市罷？我在第一天買了近二十種的年譜，因爲傳記文學是我的愛好，但價錢也就到了一百多萬！有許多史學界的名著沒人問津，即如馮氏所譯的全部中亞南洋史地叢考，我就不曾看到有人買，這個證明在今日生活狀况之下，太專門的學問已經伐人敢動手，冷門就永遠成了冷門。</p>
<p>三千七百萬買全部四部叢刊縮印本，合不到三石米，按戰前物價，才三十元，眞乃便宜透頂，但你若一加巡視，便可以看出問者寥寥，是購買力低呢？還是有錢的人本質差了呢？從前大腹賈一旦發了橫財，還肯買部廿四史裝點一下客廳，如今的暴發戶大約也不再動這種腦筋，因爲書價雖漲，究竟趕不上金鈔，他們無論買什麼，都先得計算漲價的速度呀！還有，大的暴發戶看不起這些「窮人美」的東西，他們倒寗可花金條買「支那古銅精華」，一朝鮮考古圖譜」，或是金鑲玉的爛麻沙板，字大紙白的經廠板，可以充充內行，可以待價而沽，生意經之中寓風雅，也是今日新興的風氣。</p>
<p>白報紙每令破千萬大關，本來印書即是賠錢，印了字的紙頭沒有白紙價貴，可以車來車去在倉庫裏作籌碼，所以大書店都不大肯出版東西，把舊書弄出一點來應應景兒也就算了，對於我們非要精神食糧不可的人們，威脅太大了。這幾天中央研究院的出版物减價，竭我之所有，補齊史語所集刊，而第二十本的蔡元培先生逝世紀念號，累得我跑了三次，還是沒有出版，光是車錢，賠了十幾萬，心裏雖不免浮起書店官僚化的怨怒，可是但求能肯印行這種純學術立塲的東西，已是萬幸，也就不敢再苛求其他了。</p>
<h3>富蘭克林與牀</h3>
<p>— 畫樓</p>
<p>美國的開國元動富蘭克林不但是一位大政治家，大外交家，而且也還是文學家，枓學家，眞可說是一位全才。但他對於睡覺一事，却有特殊見解。他主張每一個人應當有兩張牀。他說，我們往往午夜驚醒，不能一覺睡到天亮，其原因就在於被褥太熱了。所以他自己便每夜預備好兩張牀，各設被褥，等到這一床被褥睡得「太熱」的時候，他就趕快睡眼惺忪的跳到另一只床上去，據說這樣睡法最舒服，而且有益衛生云。</p>
<h3>弔陳散原文</h3>
<p>— 葉恭綽</p>
<p>氣作山河黯不伸，天敎　甫作詩人。身支一代風　局，淚盡中原戰伐　。生死　知　運會，去來原自泯寃親。傷心　郢城南客，入地猶應痛我　。</p>
<p>忍憶盟心四十年，高軒吟賞及殘篇。辨　共切千夫指，角藝欣爭一着先。斷夢可堪成異世，孤懷　計叩重泉。沈鱗屈蠖成何事，　望燕雲百　然。</p>
<h3>寓言</h3>
<p>— 毛毅</p>
<p>自從私有財產形成以來，自私自利的惡念，就在人類的心中種下了根，演變迄今，可說已是根深蒂固了。但是，世界史演進到今天，却比任何時期更需要每一個人的覺醒。否則，人類恐怕唯有同歸於盡這條絕路了。</p>
<p>這裏有一則不甚流傳的波斯寓言，它的啓示該能有醒世的作用：</p>
<p>在紀元六百年，有一個博學多識的聖人。有一天，他在夢中被帶進了天堂。他在天堂中看見了兩個門。一個們上寫着：「眞神所非難之廳」；另一個門上寫着：「眞神所然崇之廳」。</p>
<p>走進第一個門，聖人發現許多人正入座大享盛筵。但是，這裏的氣氛却不是痛快歡樂，反是慘澹沮喪，因爲每一個人的左臂都被綁在身側，每一個人的有臂則都被皮帶繫着一隻長柄的湯匙，皮帶綁得他們的肘部不能自由彎曲。所以，他們的湯匙雖能够臽到　設在他們的面前的珍能佳肴，可是，却無法送入自己的嘴巴。大家祗能將頭嘆氣，愁眉不展的呆着。</p>
<p>走進第二個大廳，氣氛却是淋漓歡樂的。大家都在歡宴，雖然這裏的人和另一大廳中的人同樣的手臂綁住，不能把食物送進自己的嘴巴，但是，眞神賜給了他們智慧，所以，每個人都盛起自己面前的佳肴，慷慨的餵給隣座的人吃。輸流餵食的結果，大家的口腹都有享受。</p>
<p>從這個夢境，聖人提出一個敎訓：在地球上，受餓的人是那些祗想到他們自己的人；至於那些歡宴的人則是互相帮助的人。</p>
<p>「誰能給予，誰便能存在」——自私會毀滅人類的。</p>
<h3>捐稅述異</h3>
<p>— 浣人</p>
<p>此次筆者由滬來西施故里小居，偶於鄰人閒談獲悉此地人民所負之捐稅之　與名目之衆，令人咋舌。不禁憶及歷來中外占今歷史上所記載着的各種苛捐雜稅，光怪陸離的名目，一時興至，爰自高鼻子藍眼睛的洋歷史中錄出一二，藉供高高在上執掌稅收的老爺們參考：</p>
<p>（一）鬍子稅——這是俄國彼得大帝之「政績」，直到凱塞玲女皇執政之後才取消，它特別規定不交稅的須剪去鬍子。</p>
<p>（二）葬禮稅——行於羅馬尼亞，最高額爲三千元。</p>
<p>（三）鋼琴稅——行於義大利，每座琴抽取五十里拉。</p>
<p>（四）檯球稅——也行於義大利，最高額是二百五十里拉。</p>
<p>（五）頭銜稅——此乃西班牙之「良稅」，專向有勳位的人徵收，一個公爵每年須繳數千元——筆者竭誠盼望稅收老爺們特別注意及仿行。</p>
<p>（六）窗戶稅——英國在一六九七年至一八五一年曾徵收過，稅收老爺只要在每一家的門外數一數窗子的數目就得，確是一種「輕而易舉」的稅收。</p>
<p>（七）灶稅——每　收稅兩先令，也是行於英國的，是一六六二年到一六八九年的事。</p>
<p>（八）褲稅——這是英國十七世紀的苛稅，實際就是僕人稅。</p>
<p>（九）聖經稅——這在好久前倫敦泰晤士報曾有人說過聖經將要收稅的話，不過迄今尙未付之實施，這或者是諷刺，或是預言，筆者未敢擅作決定，只得靜待事實演變了。</p>
<h3>文章滋味</h3>
<p>— 理初</p>
<p>食物營養身體，文章滋補精神，若以文章與吃相比，當非擬於不倫。下面是我品嚐近人文章所辨別出來的味道：</p>
<p>（一）魯迅　魯迅有我國高爾基之譽，執文壇牛耳者有年，其文善駁詰，辛辣苦澀兼而有之，尤以雜文爲然。他的文章好比一盃利病苦口的國藥。</p>
<p>（二）林語堂　幽默大師的文章份量甚豐而洋味極重，其文章好比西菜，營養形式都不差，就是味道差些。</p>
<p>（三）徐志摩　徐志摩天才橫溢，實天生的詩人。其文章歐化氣息亦重，又另有一種濃甜的味兒，他的散文與新詩蓋是朱古力糖無疑。</p>
<p>（四）郁達夫　達夫文如其人，疏散曠逸，毫無矯飾，讀他在「閑書」中所發表的日記，尤可見其率眞的個性。他的文章是家常便飯。</p>
<p>（五）豐子愷　子愷先生是藝術家和宗敎家，其文懇攀親切，如家人父子閑話家常，無門面語，無頭巾氣，又好比香積廚中的蔬齋，微妙香潔，食之有益身心。</p>
<h3>朝露</h3>
<p>— Y</p>
<p>生命是一串痛苦，生活便是敎　怎樣含着笑去忍受。</p>
<p>人們常常爭吵，因爲不善於辯論。</p>
<p>憂慮宛如搖椅，使你顚顚簸簸，儘忙着，却到不了那裏。</p>
<p>有誰敢說不是在夢中，却笑他人對夢的憧憬。</p>
<p>癡情人食戀着夢境，哲人等着夢醒，庸人不知是夢。</p>
<h3>中國分省新圖第五版序</h3>
<p>— 翁文灝</p>
<p>中國分省新圖係爲紀念申報六十週年而作，初版刊於民國二十二年。其岡地位準確，高度分明，參考周詳，色澤顯著，風行一時，屢經重版，以供讀者。至二十八年印至四版，時因抗戰方殷，需用雖多，未及續印。自四版至今已將十年，主持申報諸君念版岡至應珍重，前功不宜中停，不惜巨資，商得曾世英方俊二君搜集資料，編慕製繪，成此第五版新圖。當此勝利之後，台灣東北還我河山，以此岡籍之刷新，紀念金甌之完固，任重道遠，良足念矣。</p>
<p>地岡之編製，有賴於測量之資料，以往十年間，吾國經緯度之測定，頗有增益；地形水利地質工程各圖亦多貢獻；益以美國航空測繪，以及日本對於東北及台灣各圖。凡此資料，中央地質調查所收藏　多，曾方二君復廣爲收集，藉以參證。故此第五版所依據之基礎，實遠在以前各版之上。至如東北省區之劃分，各市縣地名之更正，鐵道海港之增置，凡有關近時地理之增益，自皆悉爲考訂編入。</p>
<p>地圖之編製，亦有賴於地圖學之應用。良以編製新圖，非僅按圖照抄而已。高度須有統一之標準，投影須用一定之方法，對於地形河流復宜有實際之瞭解。編製之良否，殆以編圖者學識之上下爲衡。曾方二君於製圖工作，專心從事，歷有年所；曾君復曾於戰時參加美國政府編圖任務，對於近代方法更增實驗，以二君任此新版之纂製，自可望有成績。回憶湖南鄒代鈞因襄洽邊務，而致力於歐洲製圖方法，厥後代有傳人，亞新之圖於斯　觴。申報館紀念地圖則由丁文江以地質製圖之情緒，創其始基，今復以曾方二君之努力，成此新册，後光相灝，自爲吾國圖學史上足可紀念之事跡。</p>
<p>地圖之編製，亦宜重事實之認識，而避免成說之誤傳。吾國古代繪圖，長於記水而艱於繪山，誤信二水之間必有山脈，而不知儘有山脈爲水道所橫截；誤信地形種類不外山脈與平原，而不知高原邱陵盆地瀚海冲積洲等，成因不同，關係均特重要。昔據理想成說，往往得筌忘魚；今以近代方法，依實成圖，則昭然事實，眞相甚明。此於本國實際知識之增進，自亦有所裨益。</p>
<p>曾方二君製圖工作，方將繼進不怠；申報館始終輔助，俾可問世。第一步成果爲此第五版新圖；出版有期，敢以介紹。</p>

<h3>The National Army's Two-Pronged Assault Conjoins in Kaifeng; Scattered Bandits Within the City Are Eliminated and Order Gradually Returns; Northwest Military Conference Concludes Yesterday</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Our Newspaper's Front-Line Correspondent in Eastern Henan, 26th] Powerful army corps of the National Army, advancing eastward and westward along the Longhai Railway, converged in Kaifeng at 4:00 PM on the 26th. The westward-advancing troops of Qiu Qingquan engaged in a fierce battle with the entire bandit 4th Column, totaling over 20,000 men, at Mengjiaoji (20 li southwest of Lanfeng) on the evening of the 24th. By the morning of the 25th, over 5,000 bandits had been annihilated. Furthermore, this reporter met General Liu Mao'en at the front lines yesterday. General Liu stated: he broke through the southwestern part of Kaifeng City on the morning of the 22nd. At that time, the city had already become a sea of fire. After this great calamity, it will be difficult for Biancheng [Kaifeng] to return to its former state within thirty years. General Liu expressed his intention to enter Bian alongside the army, and affirmed that the Henan Provincial Government would not relocate elsewhere.</p>
<p>[Dispatch from Our Newspaper in Xuzhou, 26th] Air Force pilots sighted the National Army's Qiu Qingquan Regiment entering Kaifeng City at 4:10 PM this afternoon. Several tanks entered first through the east gate, followed by the rapid advance of subsequent troops.</p>

A Shaanxi-Henan-Shanxi Anti-Bandit Headquarters will be established in Xi'an, with Hu Zongnan as Commander-in-Chief, governing Guanzhong, western Henan, and southern Shanxi. These changes will likely alter the situation in the Northwest and the Central Plains.</p>

For operational convenience, the Supreme Command has placed the area east of Tangshan under the command of Fan Hanjie.</p>
<h3>Encirclement of Xushui Tightens Suddenly</h3>
<p>[Dispatch from Our Newspaper in Baoding, 26th] The encirclement of Xushui has tightened suddenly, as the remaining bandits regroup. On the 25th, the National Army in Baoding conducted a multi-pronged encirclement and suppression operation along both sides of the Baoding-Beiping Railway.</p>

<h3>Explanation of the Reasons and Process for Publishing Minister He's Report</h3>
<p>Spokesperson of the Legislative Yuan Provides Explanation</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 26th] When a reporter asked the spokesperson of the Legislative Yuan today about "Minister He Yingqin's report on the recent Central Plains War at the temporary closed-door meeting of the Yuan on the 24th, since it was of a confidential nature and not allowed to be disclosed, why did the Secretariat of the Yuan publish it?", the spokesperson replied: "Minister He's report was delivered to the Secretariat of this Yuan by the Ministry of National Defense on the afternoon of the 25th, along with a letter stating that 'the content published in the Xinmin Bao is significantly different from the original report. To avoid the spread of misinformation, we have specially organized the entire report and request that you publish it on our behalf.'" The Secretariat of this Yuan, except for slightly omitting the confidential parts of the entire report, acceded to Minister He's request and published the original manuscript, intending to correct the erroneous records and prevent the spread of misinformation. The spokesperson also stated: "News reporters have the right to report any news, as long as they do not disclose military secrets."</p>
<h3>Bai Chongxi Inspects Xinyang; Telegram Sent to the President Reporting Arrival and Assumption of Duties; The Selection of Deputy Commander-in-Chief for the Central China Bandit Suppression Headquarters Has Been Internally Decided</h3>
<p>[Dispatch from Our Newspaper in Hankou, 26th] Commander-in-Chief Bai Chongxi flew to Xinyang this morning with his entourage, including Yang Shouqiong and others, to inspect the defenses. Before departing, he telegraphed the President to report his arrival and assumption of duties, and also issued a general order to the heads of all Pacification Headquarters and army corps under his jurisdiction to take note.</p>
<p>Yesterday, Bai visited He Chengjun, Xu Yuanquan, and others separately. In the evening, he convened a meeting of senior staff members of his department, providing detailed instructions on the current Central China war situation.</p>
<p>It is rumored that four Deputy Commanders-in-Chief will be appointed to the Central China Bandit Suppression Headquarters. The rumored candidates are Du Yuming, Zhang Zhen, Xia Wei, and Xu Zuyi. It is said that Xu will concurrently serve as Chief of Staff, while another account suggests that Liu Shiyi will be transferred to serve as Chief of Staff. However, official sources have solemnly stated that such speculation is premature.</p>
<h3>The Draft Provisional Property Tax Regulations Have Been Completed by the Legislative Yuan's Subcommittee; The Threshold for Inheritance Tax Awaits a Decision by the Full Yuan</h3>
<p>[Dispatch from Our Newspaper in Nanjing, 26th] The Legislative Yuan's Committee on Finance and Banking and the Subcommittee on Provisional Property Tax and Investigation of the Capital of Powerful Families held a meeting on the afternoon of the 26th to continue discussing the draft Provisional Property Tax Regulations. Jian Guansan, the chairman, first had Jiang Yiping represent the three-member subcommittee, designated by the external committee, report the results of their research on the levy of the provisional property tax on foreigners' property. They concluded that there were practical difficulties and it would be difficult to implement. The meeting then began to discuss and amend Chapters 7 and 8, "Penalties" and "Supplementary Provisions," with the following key points: (1) Those who fail to declare their property within the prescribed period according to the tax levy procedures shall be fined 50% of the tax payable. (2) Those who falsely conceal their property with the intention of evading taxes shall be fined from one to three times the tax payable, and shall also be sentenced to imprisonment for a term of not less than one year and not more than five years. (3) Those who fail to pay taxes within the prescribed period according to the tax levy procedures shall be fined 30% per ten-day period on the amount of tax owed, starting from the date of expiry. If the overdue period exceeds three months, it shall be enforced compulsorily. After the discussion of all eight chapters of the draft bill was completed, the meeting discussed again the tax rate issue of net asset value of profit-seeking enterprise, which had been retained in the previous meeting. Lu Yuwen reiterated at this point that legal persons should not be the subject of taxation, but this was still not supported by the attending members. Another amendment was passed, stipulating that if a profit-seeking enterprise is operated solely by an individual, or if it is not operated solely by an individual but the total number of shares of all shareholders of the enterprise and the net asset value of the enterprise and other property reaches the individual tax standard, then the individual's property shall still be taxed. As to whether the article governing the tax rate of the net asset value of profit-seeking enterprises will be canceled or revised due to this new regulation, it remains to be decided when the subcommittee reconvenes on the 28th. As such, it will be difficult for the Committee on Finance and Banking to submit a report to the full Yuan by the end of this month as scheduled. At the Yuan's meeting on the 29th, the committee will ask for an extension of several days on the grounds that the Yuan is carefully reviewing the bill.</p>
<p>[Dispatch from Our Newspaper in Nanjing, 26th] The Legislative Yuan's Committee on Finance and Banking, Committee on Economic Resources, and Committee on Civil Law held a joint meeting on the morning of the 26th, chaired by Wang Menglin, to review the draft amendment to the Inheritance Tax Law submitted by the Executive Yuan. There was a heated discussion on the threshold for inheritance tax. The original draft stipulated 50,000 yuan in the currency value of 1937. The committee members generally believed that this amount was too high and should be reduced. Finally, the amounts of 30,000 yuan, 20,000 yuan, and 10,000 yuan were put to a vote. Except for a few who supported 10,000 yuan, 30 members supported 20,000 yuan and 29 members supported 30,000 yuan. Neither number reached the majority of the 62 members present, so it was decided to submit these two amounts to the full Yuan to decide which one should be used as the threshold for inheritance tax.</p>

<h3>Control Yuan Urges Suppression of Price Hikes; No Measures Heard of for Daily Triple Increases; Request to the Executive Yuan for Reply to Corrective Actions</h3>
<p>[Dispatch from Our Newspaper in Nanjing, 26th] The eleventh meeting of the first Control Yuan of the Constitution was held at 9:30 AM on the 26th, with Chairman Yu Youren presiding. After the Secretariat read out the minutes of the tenth meeting, the discussion began. The first item was a temporary motion submitted by Wang Guanwu and eleven other members: "Prices have been soaring recently, increasing three times a day. We have not heard of any effective measures being announced by the responsible Yuan departments. The Yuan should urgently send personnel to Beijing and Shanghai to conduct a thorough investigation to remedy the situation, and also to pursue accountability." After this motion was put forward, several members agreed that it was necessary, starting with the investigation. It was then decided to designate the investigation committee during the meeting recess. However, when the meeting reconvened after the recess, the Secretary-General announced that the designated members were Jing Qingshen'an, Sun Yulin, Tao Baichuan of Shanghai, Yang Hu, Su Nibi, and Wang Guanwu. At that time, Sun Yulin stood up first to express his opposition, believing that we would not be able to propose solutions after sending personnel for investigation, and that the Yuan had previously submitted corrective actions to the Executive Yuan on the price issue, but there had been no follow-up. Now we can just have the Yuan send personnel to the Executive Yuan to inquire about the reply. Tian Jiongjin further believed that it was not necessary to send anyone, and that it would be enough to simply send a written inquiry. Su Nibi also spoke, believing that personnel should be sent to the Executive Yuan for investigation to inquire about the authorities' measures after the Yuan submitted the corrective actions, and that he did not approve of going to the Shanghai market for investigation. Zhang Dinghua said: "The duties of the Control Committee are to conduct its own investigations, and I do not approve of the assembly sending people to investigate the situation." Although Wang Guanwu stated that the motion had already been passed, it was finally decided to adopt Sun Wanglin's method and urge the Executive Yuan to reply to the corrective actions on suppressing price hikes. (The news that the eleventh meeting of the Control Yuan on the 26th passed a resolution dividing the country into 42 supervisory districts is published on page 2.)</p>

<h3>Experiencing Democracy Through Education</h3>
<p>— Gao Shiliang</p>
<p>China has now entered the path of democratic constitutionalism. Reflecting on this past year, from the election of national representatives to the convening of the Legislative Yuan, countless farcical situations have arisen, making us deeply aware of the need to learn more from democratic countries. Therefore, from an educational standpoint, cultivating the democratic spirit and demeanor of young people should be listed as the central training of secondary and higher schools to lay the foundation for democratic politics. Because today's young students are the government officials, parliamentary members, national representatives, and voters of the future, they all bear the mission of establishing a democratic country. Therefore, how to guide them to become loyal officials and excellent citizens in the democratic era is indeed the inescapable responsibility of today's school teachers.</p>
<p>We cannot deny that the education in colleges and high schools after the implementation of the Constitution has not changed the previous erroneous concepts. In addition to teaching and grading papers, teachers can completely ignore students' extracurricular activities. How to cultivate students' democratic life has never been noticed by schools. Even the education authorities seem to have not considered what new methods and training should be adopted for students' autonomous activities in the future. This is the crux of the problem that today's Chinese education is out of touch with life and cannot meet the needs of the times.</p>
<p>The training of democratic life mainly lies in the sound student self-government organizations and activities. Currently, there are several abnormal phenomena in student self-government activities in secondary schools that must be corrected immediately. The first is that some students bury themselves in books all day long and have no interest in extracurricular activities. Although they pay membership fees and cast ballots at the beginning of each semester, they have never inquired about any facilities of the student union. They still have the naive thought of the autocratic era that "I work at sunrise and rest at sunset; what does the emperor's power have to do with me?" Another type of student is keen on leadership desire and has a sense of superiority, as if the student union cannot be organized without them coming out every semester. The entire student union is controlled by them. The small ones just show off their personal limelight, and the big ones use it to threaten the school and instigate student unrest. There is also a kind of student who forms factions, builds fortresses, gangs up with their own kind and attacks dissidents, and ensures that there are no opposing elements in the student union. These three phenomena all have a strong feudal color and have a very bad influence on the psychological behavior of young people, and should not appear in schools under the democratic system. Therefore, I believe that guiding student self-government organizations and activities should imitate the political system of progressive democratic countries as much as possible. There are governments, parliaments, and courts, each in charge of the power of administrative, legislative, judicial, and supervisory impeachment, and can strictly enforce their duties. The election of representatives at all levels and leaders of student unions should also be done through elections. Candidates participating in the election should put forward their policy platforms that can indeed seek benefits for the school (country) and classmates (people) to win the support of all classmates. As "voters," students must also put aside personal feelings and have firm confidence and judgment in the people they want to elect, truly achieving the point of "electing the virtuous and the capable."</p>
<p>Democracy cannot be separated from freedom, but freedom must have its limits, and must be accompanied by discipline, truth, and a spirit of cooperation, and must take the national interest as a prerequisite. In European and American countries, some have a two-party system, some have a three-party system, and some have a multi-party system. However, even though there is more than one party, their democratic system can gradually become stable because political parties may have different policies, but they are consistent in their national spirit. All interests of a democratic country should belong to the people, and the interests of the public cannot be ignored due to individual freedom. The British House of Commons has a long-standing motto: "Things that concern the public must have the permission of the public." Dean Inge (W. R. Inge) commented on the British attitude towards freedom, equality, and fraternity, saying, "Among these three slogans, we are more concerned with freedom, but we are prepared to sacrifice freedom in times of crisis." This kind of democratic accomplishment of the British can be said to be derived from school. Although our constitution has been promulgated, young students only have a superficial understanding of the true meaning of democratic freedom. Although democracy is not logically equivalent to freedom, it is also wrong for schools to give up eating because of choking, and not to reasonably guide students to use freedom and understand democracy. I believe that under the principle of not violating national interests, social order, and hindering school administrative measures, schools can allow students freedom in thought and action as much as possible, so that they can fully understand the meaning and scope of democratic freedom in actual life. When their thoughts and behaviors go beyond the norm and are subject to social and public criticism, they will naturally be vigilant and re-examine themselves. This kind of lesson learned from practical experience is very educational.</p>
<p>European and American countries pay great attention to the cultivation of sportsmanship and morality in schools to train excellent democratic spirits. Before the football game between Princeton University and Yale University in the United States, there is a ceremony similar to an oath-taking ceremony. The oath says: "We pray for victory, but we pray more to maintain clean actions." The British definition of sportsmanship is interpreted as "rejoicing in the victory of the opponent as if it were our own." The spirit of the British and Americans on the playing field is often manifested in the parliament. When Roosevelt won the election, the first congratulatory telegram came from Churchill, who failed in the election. In every sports meet in our country, athletes quarrel and fight. This is still unavoidable in this National Games. This kind of inferiority also needs to be corrected by school counselors and physical education teachers.</p>
<p>In our country's real environment, many people doubt whether China can implement democracy. However, the times can only move forward, not backward, and it also depends on whether we can make up our minds and work hard to achieve it. At the end of the nineteenth century, when Disraeli, the leader of the Conservative Party who had served as British Prime Minister, passed away, Gladstone, the Prime Minister of the Liberal Party, not only did not praise Disraeli's political achievements, but instead satirized him as someone who was loyal to the Jewish race and his wife. Tracing back to the beginning of the nineteenth century, President Andrew Jackson of the United States, in order to win over party members and meet their greedy demands, left behind the poison of the "spoils system." The phrase "to the victor belongs the spoils" used as a campaign slogan became a stain on the early democratic system of the United States. Over the past hundred years, if it were not for the politicians and educators in Britain and the United States who worked hard to rectify and transform it, especially the strict democratic training given in schools, there would not have been such achievements.</p>
<p>An excellent academic atmosphere can create an excellent political atmosphere. An excellent democratic style must be nurtured from schools. Russell said: "Tolerance and common sense are psychological habits that cannot be written into the constitution." We cannot but place high hopes on educators for cultivating the democratic spirit and demeanor of the next generation of citizens.</p>
<h3>The Control Yuan's Eleventh Meeting Passed the Division of Forty-Two Supervisory Districts; Establishment of Supervisory Committee Offices in Provinces with Special Circumstances to be Postponed</h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper in Nanjing on the 26th] In the eleventh meeting of the Control Yuan on the morning of the 26th, the original agenda was to discuss the draft of the Organic Regulations of the Supervisory Committee Offices. However, a temporary motion was made by Sun Yulin, Guo Changhe, and 30 others: "Regarding the discussion of Article 2 of the Organic Regulations of the Offices, we believe that the actual issue of establishing the offices should be resolved first, and then the articles should be discussed, which would be more appropriate. We have hereby drafted a form for the establishment of offices by districts and would like to submit it for discussion first. After a decision is made, we will discuss the articles based on the decision." After unanimous agreement, the motion was discussed first. The original number of office units listed was 31, with one office and one office branch, and two temporarily suspended. The actual number of offices to be established was 29. The discussion was very serious, to the point that there were mutual disputes. According to the original plan of the proposal, the areas were: Hebei, Tianjin, and Beiping would each have three offices. However, since Ping and Tianjin are close at hand, two offices have already been established, and Hebei Province would have another office. In terms of geography, it seems a bit excessive. However, Zhao Guangchen, a supervisory committee member elected from the Tianjin district, insisted that three offices must be established to facilitate the progress of the work. Guo Zhongwei stood up and loudly proclaimed that the draft had been discussed and reviewed several times, and there had been no results for three or four days. It could be said that everyone was thinking about their own interests and not prioritizing the interests of the country and the nation. As far as I am concerned, fewer offices should be established. At that time, Zhao Guangchen immediately went to the podium and said that now is the time of democratic constitutionalism, and everyone has the right to speak. Why is someone lecturing me? I do not accept lectures. Fortunately, this was just a momentary impulse, and the discussion continued. The meeting was adjourned before noon without completion.</p>
<p>The meeting continued at 3:30 pm to discuss the Organic Regulations of the Supervisory Committee Offices, and first discussed Sun Yulin's temporary proposal, which advocated first resolving the actual issue of establishing the offices. It took a long time, but was finally fully passed. It was decided to divide the country into 42 supervisory districts and establish supervisory committee offices, with one office. However, some of them are temporarily suspended due to banditry. For example, in the nine northeastern provinces, except for the establishment in Shenyang City, the rest are temporarily suspended. After the proposal was passed, the chairman immediately submitted the provisions of Article 2 of the draft Organic Regulations regarding the establishment of office areas for discussion. He asked the assembly for their opinion on whether it should be attached to the provisions of Article 2. Some people opposed it, believing that it should be stipulated by the Control Yuan itself, otherwise it might be revised after being sent to the Legislative Yuan. It was unanimously resolved that Article 2 be amended to: "The Control Yuan divides the country into several districts, and a supervisory committee office is established in each district. The establishment of the office shall be decided by a majority of all members present and a majority of those present." Subsequently, overseas Chinese supervisory committee members believed that offices should not be established overseas, and it should also be stipulated in the express text that personnel could be dispatched for investigation. A second item was added to Article 2: "The Control Yuan may dispatch personnel to investigate overseas embassies, consulates, and state-owned enterprises at any time." The discussion had gone beyond 6 pm, so it was announced that the meeting was adjourned, and the remaining articles would be discussed at the next meeting. The units for establishing offices by district are as follows: (1) Jiangsu, (2) Anhui, (3) Jiangxi, (4) Hunan, (5) Hubei Hankou City [established in Hankou or Wuchang], (6) Zhejiang, (7) Fujian, (8) Taiwan, (9) Yunnan, (10) Guizhou, (11) Western Sichuan (established in Chengdu), (12) Eastern Sichuan Chongqing (established in Chongqing), (13) Xikang, (14) Guangdong Guangzhou (established in Guangzhou), (15) Guangxi, (16) Henan, (17) Shandong Qingdao City (established in Jinan or Qingdao), (18) Hebei Beiping City (established in Beiping), (19) Tianjin, (20) Shanxi, (21) Shaanxi Xi'an City (established in Xi'an), (22) Gansu, (23) Qinghai, (24) Ningxia (the above three provinces will temporarily jointly establish the Gansu-Qinghai-Ningxia Office), (25) Xinjiang, (26) Rehe, (27) Chahar, (28) Suiyuan (the above three provinces will temporarily jointly establish the Rehe-Chahar-Suiyuan Office), (29) Liaoning Province Shenyang City (established in Shenyang), (30) Andong, (31) Liaobei (establishment of the above two provinces to be postponed), (32) Jilin, (33) Songjiang Harbin City (establishment to be postponed), (34) Hejiang, (35) Heilongjiang, (36) Nenjiang, (37) Xing'an, (38) Dalian City (establishment of the above four provinces and one city to be postponed), (39) Tibet (establishment to be postponed), (40) Eastern Mongolia (established in Jinzhou), (41) Western Mongolia (established in Baotou), (42) Shanghai City.

<p>[Report from our newspaper in Zhenjiang on the 26th] At 9:20 this morning, the Yumin Rice Mill on Daxilu, Zhenjiang, was the scene of a near-riot. Due to the suffering of ordinary people from the rice shortage in recent days, resentment was high. This morning, they rushed to buy rice again and were disappointed. They vented their anger on the factory, scolding it in unison, almost causing a rice riot.

It is reported that the authorities have formulated ten measures to save the rice shortage and ordered the county to comply with them. It is expected that the food supply situation will improve tomorrow.</p>
<h3>The Slowly Exploding Atomic Bomb (Part 1)</h3>
<p>— Wu Jiatang</p>
<p>If you travel to Tokyo today and survey public sentiment, you will surely believe that what has changed Japan's face are not two atomic bombs, but three! The first bomb, of course, is the atomic bomb that destroyed Hiroshima, and the second fell on Nagasaki. The third can be said to be a slowly exploding atomic bomb that overturned the entire social and political foundation of Japan. This bomb, though silent, has had a more profound impact on the Japanese people than the previous two historic atomic bombs, and its consequences are irreversible. If Japan's history can truly follow the path planned by the Allied Headquarters, the Japanese people will deeply feel the power of this third, invisible atomic bomb long after Hiroshima and Nagasaki have been rebuilt.</p>
<p>The author traveled to Japan twice before the war and knows the character of the Japanese people well. However, what I saw on my recent trip to Japan was a completely different country from the past, and the words and actions of the Japanese people were also very different from the past. In my opinion, the Japanese today are well aware that they are a conquered nation, and they know very well that their way of life and destiny are entirely in the hands of the Allied Headquarters. Although the Allied Headquarters does not use the cruel methods of the former Japanese military police to control the Japanese, the Japanese are able to thoroughly understand that their every move is under the strict control of the Allied forces.</p>
<p>After talking to all sorts of Japanese people, the most striking impression is that the lightning-fast reforms in Japan after the Allied occupation have left the general public at a loss and stunned. Not all of them understand the meaning of this change; most people are just living one day at a time, vaguely not knowing where to go. After returning home, someone asked me: Have the Japanese really changed? My frank answer is: To fundamentally change a nation, time is needed; three years is really too short. However, the basic policies for reforming Japan and the methods of implementation have been established and are being actively promoted. As for whether these reforms will continue after the Allied Headquarters withdraws from Japan, that is the responsibility of China, the United States, the Soviet Union, and other relevant countries. Someone also asked me: Is it possible for Japan to become a military threat to China again? My view is that, at present, our country has no reason to fear, and the possibility of militarist Japan rising again in the coming decades is also very small. However, I believe that unless our countrymen make the greatest effort to strive for self-improvement, even a small country like Siam will one day come to humiliate us. We have no reason to fear a disarmed Japan now, but we have reason to fear that we cannot strive for self-improvement.</p>
<p>From the Japanese perspective, everything in their universe has changed. In the government organization, the Emperor system has undoubtedly undergone the most severe evolution under the new constitution. Hirohito, who was the embodiment of God in the past, is now just an ordinary citizen. Under the Meiji Constitution, the Emperor was the sacred and inviolable leader of the Empire, holding the sovereignty of the nation and legislative power, being the supreme commander of the army and navy, and having the power to declare war, negotiate peace, and conclude treaties. But today, Hirohito's power has been stripped away completely. He is not even comparable to the English monarch in the position of nominal head of state. The new constitution has vested sovereignty in the Japanese people, and Hirohito's rights and obligations are no different from those of other citizens. Legislative power is in the hands of the Diet, and Hirohito can no longer enact laws as he did in the past, with the consent of the Diet and the Imperial Conference. The laws passed after the promulgation of the new constitution are laws and no longer the imperial edicts of the past.</p>
<p>Those who are familiar with Japan and have historical knowledge will surely understand the far-reaching significance of this change to the Japanese people. I believe that the evolution of the Emperor's position has made him an insignificant figure on the Japanese political stage. When I was in Tokyo, rumors circulated that Hirohito wanted to abdicate. Someone told me that Hirohito did have this idea and had almost decided to abdicate. In fact, given his current position, this issue is not a major one politically, because every Japanese person knows that as long as the Allied Headquarters slightly hints that Hirohito should abdicate, the Emperor system will immediately become a historical name in Japan.</p>
<p>I still remember the scene when I arrived in Tokyo in 1944, how the Japanese people bowed in front of the Imperial Palace. But on this trip to Tokyo, I saw many children playing baseball on the avenue in front of the main gate of the Imperial Palace. This meaningful scene is also sufficient to prove the changes in the lives and psychology of the Japanese people.</p>

<h3>British Military Commander in Germany Demands Soviet Union Lift Land Blockade of Berlin or Soviets Should Be Fully Responsible for Starvation in Germany; Berlin Municipal Government Plans to Ask United Nations to Intervene to Relieve People's Suffering</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Dispatch] London, 26th (Broadcast): Berlin dispatch, British Military Commander in Germany, Robertson, demanded today that the Soviet Union lift the land blockade of Berlin, otherwise the Soviet side should be fully responsible for the suffering of the Germans.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper Dispatch] London, 26th (Broadcast): The British Foreign Office officially issued a statement today, strongly asserting that Britain will not withdraw from Berlin despite various ruthless obstructions by the Soviet side. Britain, the United States, and France are now conducting consultations separately in order to take joint action.</p>
<p>[Reuters London, 25th] The British Cabinet held three meetings within 24 hours. The Chief of Staff of the British Military Government in Germany, Brownjohn, was summoned from Berlin to London to present a report on the Berlin situation to the Cabinet. The Under-Secretary of the British Foreign Office and Director of the German Department, Strang, also met with US Ambassador Douglas and French Ambassador Massigli today to discuss the Berlin situation.</p>
<p>[United Press Berlin, 25th] The Soviet Union announced on the 25th that the Soviet ban on train and automobile traffic to the Western zones of Germany will be lifted on the 28th. This ban has threatened 2.5 million Berlin residents with starvation. At the same time, the Soviet Union continues to enforce [the blockade], aiming to force the Western Allies to withdraw from Berlin, and has stopped importing bituminous coal into Berlin. The Soviet side claimed that the Soviet action was in retaliation for Britain's cessation of importing Ruhr anthracite coal into the Soviet zone. According to the Four-Power Agreement, the Soviet Union supplies Berlin with bituminous coal, and the Western countries supply the Soviet zone with anthracite coal.</p>
<p>[United Press Berlin, 26th] American planes began transporting milk and medicine to Berlin on the 26th to aid the 2.5 million Berlin residents.</p>
<p>[Reuters Berlin, 26th] Berlin Deputy Mayor Friedensburg declared that the Berlin Municipal Government will submit a document to the United Nations authorities, detailing the Berlin situation, including currency reform, electricity restrictions, unemployment caused by factory closures, and the threat of starvation faced by the Berlin people, in order to request the United Nations authorities to intervene to relieve the suffering of the Berlin people.</p>
<h3>US Considering How to Deal with Warsaw Conference; Plans to Make Further Probes with Soviet Union; Wants to Know If There Is Sincerity to Resume Negotiations with Germany</h3>
<p>[Reuters Washington, 25th] US officials believe that the Warsaw Conference communique's request for the Four Powers to establish an agreement on Germany is intended to win over the German people. The communique did not state that the Soviet Union was the one preventing the resolution of the German problem, which clearly shows its propagandistic effect, so that the German people can attribute the current state of Germany to the Western Allies. US officials also believe that the recent Berlin events show that the Soviet Union wants to occupy the entire Berlin as the capital of the new East Germany. Observers believe that Marshall will soon confront Molotov and Stalin's peace offensive with an attitude of dealing with the Warsaw Conference, demanding that the Soviet Union put forward concrete and specific proposals to show its sincerity in resuming negotiations.</p>
<p>[Reuters Warsaw, 25th] The delegates from the eight Eastern European countries who participated in the Foreign Ministers Conference have departed from Warsaw today to return to their respective countries. Molotov arrived safely in Moscow on the evening of the 25th. According to Foreign Minister Clementis, he returned to Prague and gave a radio address from the Prague radio station that night. Although the communique of the Eight-Nation Foreign Ministers Conference requested the establishment of an all-German interim government, it is still widely rumored unofficially that the Soviet Union will establish an East German state, with its headquarters in Leipzig.</p>
<p>Observers here believe that the Eastern European Foreign Ministers can be certain that they have prepared a plan to take political and propaganda actions to deal with the Western powers' refusal to reopen the Four-Power German question negotiations. It is thought that the convening of this large-scale conference was definitely not just to draft the communique that was issued last night. Judging from the meaning of the communique, two interpretations are possible. The communique's insistence on reaching an agreement on the whole of Germany is still an attempt to reopen negotiations on a Four-Power basis; this is one. Otherwise, this is just a preliminary action to prepare public opinion to accept new measures regarding East Germany in the future; this is the second. If the Western powers agree to reopen Four-Power talks, their plans regarding West Germany will inevitably be temporarily shelved, giving the Soviet Union ample time to carry out its East German plans. If the Western powers refuse to resume Four-Power discussions, the Eastern European propaganda apparatus will launch an offensive, condemning the Western countries for splitting Germany. Observers are convinced that the five points announced in the communique of the Eight-Nation Conference are concealing the true nature of this meeting, and the establishment of an East German government must have been one of the main topics on the agenda.</p>
<h3>West Berlin Conserves Electricity and Food</h3>
<p>[Reuters Berlin, 25th] The West Zone authorities have, starting today, implemented a reduction of 50 to 75 percent in the food and fuel rations to various industrial and military organizations. Also, since the British, American, and French zones of Berlin have been reduced in electricity supply, factories are only allowed to use 25 percent of their usual electricity consumption from today, and household current will also be stopped for twelve hours each day.</p>
<h3>West German Occupation Zone Permits East German Mark to Circulate</h3>
<p>[United Press Berlin, 26th] US Military Commander in Germany, Howley, announced tonight that the new mark of the Western occupation zones and the currency issued by the Soviet Union are both legal tender in the US, British, and French occupation zones of Berlin. The Soviet Union had previously prohibited the use of the new currency of the Western occupation zones in the Soviet zone of Berlin, and those who violated it would be arrested.</p>
<p>[United Press Berlin, 26th] The Berlin Municipal Government passed a resolution yesterday, requesting that the Soviet Union and the Western Allied authorities allow the free circulation of both East and West Marks in the four zones of Berlin. Currently, the East German Mark can already circulate freely in the West Berlin zone, so the purpose of the request is only to ask the Soviet authorities to allow the West German Mark to circulate freely in the Soviet zone of Berlin. Also, many counterfeit notes have been discovered in the East German Mark issued by the Soviet authorities, which has stimulated the rise in black market prices.</p>
<h3>US Aid for Raw Material Allocation; China Gets Rice, Cotton, Flour</h3>

<h3>Britain, France, etc., Express Dissent to Most-Favored-Nation Treatment for Japan; US Aid Bilateral Agreement Obstructed</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse Washington, 25th] According to well-informed sources, when Harriman led the US economic delegation to Japan to investigate its reconstruction and economic organization, he promised MacArthur that Japan would receive most-favored-nation treatment in the future. Therefore, the United States, Britain, France, Switzerland, and Denmark negotiated a bilateral agreement on the implementation of the Marshall Plan, and firmly insisted on including this point in the terms, which became a major obstruction.</p>
<p>Now, on other controversial issues, such as the control of European exchange rates and the granting of most-favored-nation treatment to Germany, most compromise solutions have been negotiated. It is now known that the former European countries will retain full sovereignty, and the latter requires the United States to grant Germany this treatment for a long period, while Britain and France firmly insist on a short period, and a compromise solution has been reached on this point.</p>
<h3>Other Relevant Terms Have Been Compromised</h3>
<p>[Reuters Washington, 25th] US State Department and British spokesmen expect that a compromise solution to the bilateral agreement under the Marshall Plan can be reached within 24 hours. The State Department said it believes that the bilateral agreement between the United States and 16 European countries can be signed before the July 3 deadline. It is reported that compromise solutions have been reached on the following three points: (1) The clause that the United States has the right to request recipient countries to provide opinions on currency devaluation at any time has been deleted, but recipient countries must maintain an "effective" exchange rate; (2) The United States and each signatory country have the right to withdraw from the agreement with nine months' notice; (3) If the United States suffers losses due to the implementation of state-owned projects by the recipient country, the United States may appeal to the International Court of Justice for compensation, but it must do so after the country's courts have accepted and concluded the United States' appeal. It is reported that a clause on granting most-favored-nation treatment to Germany and Japan is still under negotiation.</p>

I think we should help the Chinese government maintain a free China."

<h3>Churchill Advocates a Tough Stance Against the Soviet Union to Prevent World War III; Condemns Government for Disintegrating the Empire</h3>

Although the figures for each budget are kept strictly secret by all parties, judging from the long-term plan for the revitalization of Japan and South Korea and the plan to build military bases in Guam, the Philippines, and other places, MacArthur's new request may reach a huge sum of 2.5 billion.</p>

<h3>U.S. Republican Presidential Candidate Dewey's Full Speech — Establishing World Order Through Various Peaceful Means</h3>
<p>[Special dispatch from the United States News Agency, Philadelphia, 25th] New York Governor Dewey, upon accepting the Republican nomination for president on Thursday evening, called for "efforts to establish a world order based on principles of fairness and justice through all peaceful means." As Dewey entered the convention hall, the delegates and attendees cheered like thunder.</p>
<p>The full text of Dewey's acceptance speech as a presidential candidate is as follows:</p>
<p>"I am deeply grateful for the favor and trust you Republicans have shown me by again nominating me as a candidate for President of the United States. At the same time, I keenly feel the weight of this responsibility. I accept your nomination. With a humble heart, I pray to God that I deserve this opportunity to serve the nation.</p>
<p>I come before you unbound by any obligations or promises, free to join you in selecting the nation's most outstanding men and women to serve the country, free to unite my party and my nation to meet the grave challenges of our time.</p>
<p>United, with deep understanding and a broad spirit, we can meet this challenge. This unity transcends mutual accusations, transcends party affiliation, and transcends selfishness. These are the principles that have shaped the greatness of America. Our nation is eager to see the power of this belief again. They place this belief at the heart of our national life, and this is what we must do, and what we will do.</p>
<p>At this historic convention, there are six other candidates who have participated in the presidential campaign. They are all people of noble thought, excellent character, talent, and loyalty to the country: Senator Baldwin, General MacArthur, Governor Stassen, Senator Taft, Senator Vandenberg, and Governor Warren. This is a challenging choice in a glorious competition. It is a moving expression of the life, vitality, and ideals of our Republican Party.</p>
<p>Our campaign is sincere, with fervent disagreements and intense debates. But let no one be mistaken. You have shown moving evidence that, although Americans may have different opinions, they are all moving forward shoulder to shoulder for the welfare of the nation.</p>
<p>Our current responsibility and opportunity are the greatest in the history of free government. For tonight, our future—our peace, our prosperity, and the fate of freedom itself—hangs in the balance.</p>
<p>Merely winning the election is not our job or our purpose. Our job is to imbue our victory with meaning so that freedom-loving people everywhere will gain courage, move forward, and emerge from this dark despair into the light of freedom.</p>
<p>Our platform declares the signposts that will guide our steadfast efforts in a world of terror. This glorious statement of principles is concise and essential.</p>
<p>You have unanimously adopted it, and I support it unanimously, feeling deeply honored. This is the central message I will bring to the country, and after January 20th, it will be the cornerstone of our Republican government.</p>
<p>We are a united party, and our nation desperately needs the same unity.</p>
<p>Our people are turning away from the baser things that divide us. They yearn to rise to a nobler position and seek a common purpose in the better things that unite us. We must be the instrument to realize this ideal. We must fully unleash the strength of America and refill the turbulent future with opportunity. This is our promise. This will be the fruit of our victory.</p>
<p>If this unity is to be obtained and maintained, it requires great breadth. Its boundaries must transcend politics. Only if free people everywhere can make this unity their common goal can freedom be saved—and it is the only way to save it.</p>
<p>Such unity must be the main pillar of peace. Peace obtained at the cost of freedom is too high a price, and such peace cannot last. Above all else, we must strive, through all peaceful means, to establish a world order based on justice. Such a world will achieve peace. Such peace is worth obtaining. This is the greatest responsibility that our nation places upon us. It is the greatest task to which we are prepared to dedicate ourselves.</p>
<p>The unity we seek transcends the material; it transcends things and methods. It is largely spiritual. Our problem is not outside ourselves; our problem is within ourselves.</p>
<p>In the material realm, we have found ways to make the world explode. In the spiritual realm, we must still seek ways to join together the shattered fragments of the world, to heal the wounds of civilization, and to create a good society composed of people of goodwill, so that our dreams may finally be realized. We have designed noble plans for the new world, but without a new spirit, our noblest plans will be meaningless. We pray that in the days to come, we will be fully endowed with this spirit.</p>
<p>The next presidential term will see the end of the first half of the twentieth century. Thus far, this century has been one of astonishing progress and terrible tragedy. We have seen the world change, and we have seen humanity achieve extraordinary success in its long struggle against nature. However, because we have encountered a disastrous defeat in humanity's quest for peace, security, and understanding, our victories have been overshadowed by darkness. In this age of twentieth-century progress, we have encountered two terrible wars, and between these two wars, there has been the most severe economic depression in human history.</p>
<p>We must learn to do better. The era that is nearly passing away is an era of scientific achievement. The era that lies ahead of us must be an era of human spiritual achievement.</p>
<p>We propose to continue all the great achievements of our era in craftsmanship. We should utilize the various incredible possibilities of atomic energy so that men and women can have a greater and more fulfilling life. We must concentrate all of humanity's energy, intelligence, and determination, focusing wholeheartedly on our task. We must solve the problem of establishing lasting world peace and secure the happiness of freedom and opportunity for our own people and other like-minded peoples.</p>
<p>In my view, to be a Republican in this era, one must be dedicated to human freedom. In this world, half free and half slave, we must work peacefully to help people everywhere gain freedom.</p>
<p>We have determined that our goal is a strong and free America, a free world of free people—freedom of speech, freedom to express new ideas, freedom of publication, freedom of movement, freedom of education, freedom to use the fruits of labor, freedom to worship God, each according to his own conception of God's grace and mercy.</p>
<p>When these rights are secured in the world, the eternal ideals of the Republican Party will be realized.</p>
<p>The ideals of the American people are the ideals of the Republican Party. Here in Philadelphia, the cradle of our own independence, we have ignited a beacon. We light this beacon, giving humanity eternal hope, enabling humanity to live in freedom, with human dignity, and to stand freely before God in a posture of reverence."</p>

<h3>Census of Warehouses: Three Suspected of Hoarding</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] The police bureau started a general inspection of warehouses yesterday, and from 10:00 AM to 5:00 PM, it is said that three companies suspected of hoarding materials were found. Details are expected to be released tomorrow.</p>
<h3>Strict Control of Materials to Prevent Hoarding: Authorities Decide on Emergency Measures; Order Essential Goods and Warehouse Industries to Report Transaction and Stockpiling Situations; Rice Purchased with Permits from Today at a Price Not Exceeding 100,000 per Liter</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] With prices soaring to unprecedented levels recently, Mayor Wu convened an ad hoc emergency meeting of all relevant parties at 2:00 PM yesterday to discuss emergency measures. After the meeting adjourned, Mayor Wu reported to the City Council at 3:45 PM, stating: "I feel ashamed as it is my responsibility that prices have soared recently. The price fluctuations yesterday were alarming. Last night, I discussed with the Civil Affairs Commission and the Social Affairs Bureau the method of increasing the allocation of rice. It was decided that starting today, in addition to the existing rice allocation certificates, citizens can also obtain joint purchase certificates, each certificate allowing the purchase of one 'shi sheng' of rice at a price not exceeding 100,000 yuan per 'sheng,' and can purchase rice from rice shops until the end of June. Also, today (the 26th), after inviting the leaders of all relevant parties, Speaker Pan, Xuan Qinwu, Fang Zhi, Wu Kaixian, Yu Hongjun, Liu Gongyun, etc., to discuss the matter, four emergency measures were decided: (1) Orders are issued to various industry associations for daily necessities (including grain, miscellaneous grains, cotton, yarn, cloth, cooking oil, fuel, paper, sugar, etc.) to truthfully report all transaction details from the 5th of this month to the date of the report within three days. The purpose is: (a) to determine whether both buyers and sellers are in the trade; (b) to investigate any suspected hoarding. (2) Orders are issued to various warehouse industry associations to report the stockpiling situation of each household and the start date of stockpiling. The purpose is: (a) to determine whether non-industry people are stockpiling goods; (b) to determine whether the stockpiling date exceeds the time limit stipulated by the authorities. (3) The Gold Control Bureau, together with the Social Affairs Bureau and the Audit Department of the Central Bank, are requested to closely monitor the flow of bills in the bill exchange, and investigate whether bills are being used for illegal transactions. (4) The cotton yarn market is fluctuating because factories are worried about insufficient cotton reserves. However, it has been found that there are currently 150,000 bales of cotton stored in Shanghai. In addition to the 57,000 bales stored by the Textile Export Association, 90,000 bales of foreign cotton from U.S. aid have also been allocated. Once the procedures are completed, they can be distributed, so there is no shortage of cotton reserves. The meeting also decided that those found to have committed speculation, manipulation, or hoarding in the recent surge in prices will be reported to the central government for strict punishment. It is now proposed that the senators provide sound solutions.</p>
<p>[Another report] Governor of the Central Bank Yu Hongjun returned to Shanghai from Beijing yesterday. In the morning, he met with Lin Chongyong, director of the Hankou Gold Control Bureau, Gao Fang, director of the Guangzhou Gold Control Bureau, etc., and inquired about the financial situation in various places. In the afternoon, he went to the municipal government to attend the emergency economic meeting. It is said that the central government is extremely concerned about the high prices in Shanghai. His decision to come to Shanghai is to discuss concrete solutions with the relevant leaders of the city. As for the methods of selling off materials and tightening credit, they will be strengthened in the future, and sales will be expanded starting next week.</p>
<h3>The Sixth Session of the City Council: A Debate on Property Tax Unfolds; Fierce Debate for Three Hours; No Conclusion</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] The sixth session of the City Council held its fourth meeting yesterday. During the meeting, a heated debate was launched on the case of the Legislative Yuan discussing the collection of property tax. It lasted for more than three hours, with 20 senators speaking. Opinions on the case were mixed. At the statutory adjournment time, no conclusion could be reached. Moreover, the senators present continued to leave, and there were not enough to meet the legal quorum, so a vote could not be held. It was decided to postpone the discussion and resolution to the fifth meeting.</p>
<p>At the beginning of yesterday's meeting, Speaker Pan introduced Mayor Wu's report on emergency measures to deal with price fluctuations, and then began discussing the opinions of the various group review proposals. The agenda was scheduled to discuss a total of three proposals from the Civil Affairs Group, a total of thirteen proposals from the Finance Group, and a total of twenty proposals from the Public Works Group.</p>
<p>Civil Affairs Section</p>
<p>Two cases were passed: (1) It is proposed to request the municipal government to effectively protect local autonomous personnel, not to arbitrarily detain them, and to strengthen the connection between the autonomous units of each district and the affiliated units of the municipal government, so as to achieve operational efficiency. (2) A request is made to telegraph the central government again to re-determine the erroneous division of Zhu Zhai semi-town into provincial jurisdiction, so as to comply with the constitutional government's respect for public opinion and promote the new administration. Another case, that the Baojia chiefs are also civil servants and should have the right to in-kind rations, was resolved and sent to the Civil Affairs Bureau for research.</p>
<p>Financial Section</p>
<p>Two cases were passed and two cases were reserved. When it came to the fifth case of property tax, a lengthy debate was triggered. The two cases passed were (1) the council should promptly send a letter to the municipal government to forward to the Gold Control Bureau, and immediately abolish the method of not allowing customers' bills to be used for offsetting on the same day. (2) An urgent telegram should be sent to the central government to promptly transfer the funds and deposits that the Chinese people have evaded abroad for the time being as reserves, and immediately reform the currency system to consolidate finance and stabilize people's hearts.</p>
<p>Two Views on the Property Tax Case</p>
<p>Regarding the proposal to levy property tax, the original proposals had the same nature: (1) He Chengfu proposed two opposing proposals by Chen Zhang, and Gong Da and other 20 people jointly signed, advocating telegraphing the local legislators to strictly support the levy of temporary property tax, so as to equalize social wealth and save the crisis. (2) Wang Ziyang and other 54 people jointly proposed: a telegram should be sent to the Legislative Yuan to suspend the levy of property tax, and immediately formulate a law to investigate the capital of the wealthy, so as to stabilize people's hearts and balance wealth. After convening a review meeting, it was merged into the second case and submitted together, proposing that the general assembly telegraph the Legislative Yuan: (1) suspend the levy of property tax; (2) promptly formulate another law to investigate the capital of the wealthy, ordering the registration of property and adding tax.</p>
<p>When the case was brought up for discussion, He Chengfu, the proposer who supported property tax, first requested Wang Yansong, the convener of the review meeting, to explain the reasons for the merger, and then the debate began. Those who participated in the debate included He Chengfu, Yan Esheng, Fan Xipin, Zhang Zhihan, Jiang Hao, Fei Shusheng, Chen Gongda, Xu _, Qu Yue, Fan Shouyuan, Xu Yongzuo, Zhang Zhongyuan, Chu Shun, Zhao Yangxiong, Jiang Haoran, Bu Yongsheng, Yang Fusheng, etc. The main points of the opinions of both sides are summarized as follows:</p>
<p>Advocating Suspension</p>
<p>Those who believe in levying property tax think (1) The minimum amount for property tax is 30 billion yuan. At the current rate of inflation, in a few months, everyone's property will become the object of collection. (2) The real wealthy have already fled their assets abroad. Even those in the country, those who hide are gold and foreign currencies, which are easy to hide. As a result, only the goods, equipment, machinery, factories, ships, vehicles, etc. of industry and commerce that cannot be concealed have to be truthfully declared and pay taxes according to regulations, and they will inevitably have to sell the goods and raw materials on which they rely for daily use and transportation, leading to bankruptcy. (3) The levy of property tax will inevitably cause a large escape of capital. The large ones will fly away, and the small ones will speculate in gold and banknotes. (4) Although the draft property tax regulations stipulate that all real estate and movable property of Chinese people abroad and non-Chinese people in China will be taxed, it is difficult to implement. (5) The government has not proposed the levy of property tax, only some legislators have proposed it. (6) Taxes that harass the majority of people are bad taxes, and there is no need for them to be established. (7) The government already has seven or eight types of tax laws, and it should first study how to strengthen collection, which will be more helpful to balance revenue and expenditure. Therefore, the levy of property tax is not an urgent matter at present.</p>
<p>Supporting the Levy</p>
<p>Those who believe in property tax think (1) Eight years of war of resistance, followed by civil strife, the people's lives have long been unbalanced. Only by making everyone have clothes to wear and food to eat, and money to contribute money, and strength to contribute strength, can the tide of the situation be reversed. (2) The case was proposed by the first democratically elected legislators, and it does not seem appropriate for the local council to arbitrarily request a suspension. (3) The temporary property tax is for the purpose of cooperating with the suppression of the rebellion policy. If a suspension is requested, it is tantamount to believing that the suppression of the rebellion policy is no longer necessary. (4) The industrial and commercial circles do not need to worry, because the property tax is generally levied, and the wealthy are no exception. Moreover, before the levy, it must go through procedures such as investigation and declaration, and will never deliberately destroy industry and commerce.</p>
<p>Compromise suggestions</p>
<p>(1) It is hoped that Senator Wang Gu will return to the various districts he represents, and generally solicit the opinions of all voters on the levy of property tax, and then report to the meeting to see what the public opinion is. (2) All the opinions supporting and opposing the property tax today will be recorded in the file. At the same time, the council will conduct a general public opinion survey, summarize and provide it to the Legislative Yuan for reference. (3) The Legislative Yuan has not yet made a principled passage on this case, and is still under review by the group. It may be better not to express an opinion for the time being to see the development. (4) It may be better to modify the wording of the original proposal to levy property tax under the condition of not hindering the survival of legitimate industry and commerce.</p>
<h3>Teachers of Private Schools Push Representatives to Petition the Council Education Bureau</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] Teachers of private primary schools in the city, in order to request rice allocation loans and subsidies, sent 30 to 40 representatives to the City Council yesterday to petition, and also went to the Education Bureau to meet Director Li to state their reasons. Director Li promised to reply on Monday afternoon.</p>
<h3>Rice Certificates for July Will Be Distributed Starting Today</h3>
<p>According to reliable information from the Civil Affairs Commission: The rice allocation certificates for July have been sent to the Bao Offices and distributed to the Jia chiefs. The Jia chiefs will distribute them to each household on the 27th and 28th. During the certificate issuance period, residents who registered their household in May but failed to receive the July rice allocation certificate should go to the Jia chiefs to receive it on the 29th and 30th of this month. No supplementary issuance will be made after the deadline. In order to strengthen the rice allocation work in July, the association will hold a meeting of district representatives and group leaders of rice shops in the city at the Lawyers Association on Huangpi South Road at 9:00 AM this morning. It is said that rice for teachers and staff of private primary and secondary schools has begun to be distributed today and will be completed before the 30th of this month.</p>
<h3>Business Community Held a Symposium Yesterday to Discuss the Issue of Levying Property Tax; Representatives Set to Go to Beijing Tonight to Petition</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Industrial Association Preparatory Committee and the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, in order to oppose the issue of levying property tax, specially invited legal scholars and people from the press in the city to hold a symposium at the sixth floor of the China Merchants Bureau at noon yesterday. Speaker Pan first expressed his opinions: (1) Oppose the method of reporting secrets to prevent abuses. (2) The starting point of taxation must be considered, paying attention to the current price level. (3) Legal persons should not be included. Mr. Pan also pointed out that although the motive of property tax is good, the result will be contrary to the intention of equalizing wealth. Subsequently, Zhang Shizhao, Cheng Cangbo, Shan Yuhua, Xu Yongzuo and others successively expressed their opinions, and all agreed that the purpose of property tax is indisputable, but it should be clear that the target is the wealthy. Cheng Cangbi also pointed out that the industrial and commercial circles must pay attention to public opinion offensives, and should openly or use radio stations to debate with the legislators who proposed the proposal, so as to win the support of public opinion. The meeting ended at three o'clock. In addition, the representatives of the industrial and commercial circles of the city are scheduled to go to Beijing tonight to attend the meeting of the Finance and Finance Examination Committee convened by the Legislative Yuan tomorrow to state the opinions of the industrial and commercial circles.</p>
<h3>Deputy Assessor of the Fuel Management Committee Arrested in Beijing for Absconding; Zhu Xukun, Who Embezzled Public Funds While Serving as Commander, Escorted to Shanghai and Detained in Wuhan Today</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] Zhu Shunkun, Deputy Director of the Fuel Management Committee of the Shanghai District of the Ministry of Economic Affairs, was arrested at No. 45, Meiguo New Village, Nanjing, on the evening of the 24th, for absconding after embezzling public funds while serving as the former commander. He was escorted to Shanghai that night and is scheduled to be escorted to the Military Law Office of the Wuhan Pacification Office by plane from Shanghai this afternoon for trial.</p>
<p>It is reported that Zhu Shunkun is from Sichuan. During the war, he served as the Major General Commander of the 34th Division and was stationed in Jiangxi. After the victory, the National Army was reorganized, and Zhu was transferred to serve as the Major General Deputy Commander of the 72nd Division. During his term of office, he colluded with his guard Yang Guilin to use his position to sell 20 military trucks, 1,000 rifles, 25 carbines, more than 20 light machine guns, and tens of thousands of various bullets. When the 72nd Division was transferred to the Tianjin-Pukou Line in October last year, Zhu was dismissed for cause. In January of this year, due to his relationship with the Youth Party, he was appointed Deputy Director of the Fuel Management Committee of the Shanghai District of the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Director of the Transportation Department. Recently, someone reported to the Wuhan Pacification Office, and the Military Law Office of the Office sent a judge to Shanghai with an official letter, requesting the garrison brigade of the Garrison Command to assist. Captain Lu of the brigade sent Xu Xiaohua, the first captain of the brigade, to lead the officers to the Fuel Management Committee of the China Bank Building on the Bund and the Fuel Management Office of the Zilin West News Building on the Bund on the 18th of this month to arrest him. However, Zhu had already escaped after hearing the news in advance. Captain Xu then led his officers to Zhu's residence at No. 542, Baochang Road, Zhabei, and learned that Zhu had gone to Beijing for activities before the 14th of this month. He then found out that Zhu was hiding in the office of the Fuel Management Committee at No. 45, Meiguo New Village, Nanjing. He then sent officers to Beijing to join the local Gendarmerie Regiment and arrested Bi on the morning of the 24th.</p>
<h3>Luo Meizhong and He Qishen Appointed as Deputy Directors of the China Trust Bureau</h3>
<p>The Board of Directors of the Central Trust Bureau held its fourth meeting on the afternoon of the 26th and passed the following: (1) The resignation of Deputy Directors Shen Xirui and Shen Zutong was approved; (2) Luo Meizhong and He Qishen were appointed as Deputy Directors. Luo is currently the Deputy General Manager of the Central Cooperative Treasury and Manager of the Shanghai Branch, and He is currently a Counselor of the Ministry of Finance and Secretary of the National Bank.</p>
<h3>Chen Cheng's Health Gradually Recovering</h3>
<p>Since Chen Cheng was admitted to the National Defense Medical College to treat his stomach disease and underwent surgery, his health has been improving day by day. The stitches in the surgery area have been removed, and his spirit is very good. However, he is slightly thinner than before. He is now eating liquid food and can sit up and stand up slightly. According to the doctor's orders, he cannot walk around outside the ward. Because he is afraid of being tired after talking too much, he still does not receive visiting guests.</p>
<h3>Director of the Health Bureau Firmly Requests Resignation</h3>
<p>Zhang Wei, Director of the Municipal Health Bureau, took a month's leave to return to his hometown. The leave will expire at the end of this month. It is now known that Director Zhang recently sent a telegram to Mayor Wu requesting resignation, and also sent a letter from his hometown to the City Council, expressing his determination to resign.</p>
<h3>Huang, Chief Prosecutor, Transferred to Work in the Ministry; Zhang Yuquan Succeeds the Vacancy</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] Huang Liang, Chief Prosecutor of the Shanghai District Procuratorate, was transferred to the Ministry of Justice. The vacancy will be succeeded by Zhang Yuquan, Chief Prosecutor of Jiangxi Province. It is reported that Huang's decision to transfer to the Ministry is to go to the United States to study law for a year, and to study Anglo-American law at Indiana University in the United States. This statement was confirmed when Huang met with reporters yesterday. Huang believes that Chinese law will tend to adopt Anglo-American law. He proposed to Minister Xie Guansheng the idea of going to the United States to study Anglo-American law as early as when the enemy surrendered in 34 years. He was only allowed to do so when Minister Xie came to Shanghai at the end of last month. Huang expressed his satisfaction that the District Procuratorate handles cases quickly, and can complete an average of one case in ten days. He finally explained that after the amnesty and commutation of sentences, a total of more than 3,000 people were released in the city. As of the end of last month, 804 people who had committed serious crimes were confirmed. There are currently more than 10,000 prisoners in Shanghai, accounting for one-twentieth of the total number of prisoners in the country, and there are more than 1,000 guards, accounting for one-thirtieth of the total number in the country.</p>
<h3>The General Manager of the China Women and Children Relief Association Accused of Malpractice</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] Ding Hao, former Chief Secretary of the China Women and Children Relief Association, submitted a complaint to the District Procuratorate yesterday, accusing Zhou Naihao, the general manager of the association, of engaging in corruption and malpractice, and requesting investigation according to law. The complaint lists six points: (1) Selling public property. When the association was ending, the defendant colluded with Jiang to sell more than 100 bolts of cloth. (2) Privately printing receipts. The receipts for donations to the association were written on recycled paper, while those handled by the defendant himself were self-issued receipts. (3) Selling old allocated rice at black market prices to make profits. (4) Sharing donations, privately printing many donation books, and Dai Miao mobilized donations from all walks of life for sharing. Some of them were recognized by donors, who returned the money. (5) Protecting litigation. Last year, he instigated Zhang Jinzhai's wife to pretend to commit suicide, causing her to accuse her father. (6) Obstructing freedom, using difficult children in the association to launch a storm.</p>
<h3>Buying and Selling Silver Coins is Not Illegal; The Ministry of Justice's Statement is Incorrect</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 26th] According to a spokesman for the Ministry of Justice, those who exchange silver coins at rates other than the legal rate should be punished according to law. The report that the Ministry instructed the Shanghai District Court that buying and selling silver coins is not illegal is absolutely incorrect.</p>
<h3>Price Indices Far Out of Touch: Relevant Parties to Meet Tomorrow to Discuss Index Compilation Issues</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] The Municipal Federation of Labor previously requested the Social Affairs Bureau to publish a decision on the cost of living index every half month. Yesterday, this reporter visited Director Wu to inquire about his opinion. Director Wu stated that during this time of rampant price increases, workers are deeply affected by the hardships in their lives. The request from the Federation of Labor to publish the cost of living index every half month, so that there is a basis for issuing wages every half month, is reasonable. However, there is one difficulty: publishing a decision every half month is beyond the capacity of the Bureau's statistics office, and approximately half the personnel would need to be added. Due to economic limitations, it is proposed that the Federation of Labor assist with index compilation. Regarding whether there are technical difficulties in publishing a decision every half month, a meeting will be held at the Social Affairs Bureau on the 28th, with Municipal Government Statistics Chief Zhang Zongmeng, the Social Affairs Bureau, and the Statistics Office of the Federation of Labor to discuss and decide. If the principle is approved, it will be implemented starting next month.</p>
<p>Endure Hardships Together, Overcome Difficulties Together</p>
<p>This reporter also inquired about this issue to Senator Wang Xianqing. According to him, if the multiplier is too small next month, the average worker and staff will be unable to maintain their minimum standard of living. If the increase is too large, factories will face the danger of being unable to survive. Therefore, the agency compiling the index must conduct thorough research and develop a proper plan. However, he believes that at this critical stage, there is no longer a distinction between labor and management. The most important thing is that both parties cooperate, endure hardships together, and overcome difficulties together. Ye Xianggao, Standing Director of the Federation of Labor, stated that the authorities should expedite and effectively manage the rationing of essential goods.</p>
<p>Ways Should Be Found to Suppress and Stabilize Prices</p>
<p>Subsequently, Shui Xiangyun, Chairman of the Federation of Labor, also told reporters that calculating wages based on the cost of living index is purely a method to ensure that wages and prices do not become disconnected, allowing the average worker to obtain a fair and reasonable standard of living. Since its implementation, it has been very effective, and labor-management disputes have been continuously reduced. However, in the past one or two months, prices have reached a rampant state, even changing several times a day. Under these circumstances, it is no longer possible to calculate wages using the cost of living index. Even if the index multiplier is increased, it would not be beneficial for factories, and it would not necessarily be a blessing for the workers themselves. The fundamental problem is that without appropriate measures to suppress prices, the future is unimaginable. If wages and prices are too far apart, not only will workers' livelihoods be affected, leading to continuous labor-management disputes, but social order and security will also be negatively impacted. He personally believes that the best solution is for the government to take urgent measures to stabilize prices as soon as possible. At the same time, the compilation of the index should also include a renewed household survey and an increase in quality and weight. He said that tomorrow at 9 a.m., relevant parties will meet at the Social Affairs Bureau to thoroughly discuss this issue in order to find an appropriate solution.</p>
<h3>Airline Fare Adjustments Not Yet Approved by Ministry of Communications; Ship Price Increase Postponed to the 29th</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Communications has not yet approved the Civil Aviation Company's request to adjust fares. According to the person in charge of the China Central No. 2 Company, the main factors for adjusting civil aviation fares are fuel consumption and the cost of living index for employees. If the government can stabilize fuel prices and the cost of living index, then civil aviation fares can be maintained without increases. It is reported that the Ministry of Communications will slightly reduce the 189% fare adjustment requested by the Civil Aviation Company. Furthermore, the Shipowners' Association previously decided to adjust all passenger and freight rates on all routes by 80% and agreed to implement it on the 28th of this month. As the Ministry of Communications has not yet responded, and the price increase procedures could not be completed due to the short timeframe, it has been decided to postpone the implementation to the 29th.</p>
<h3>Automatic Traffic Lights First Installed for Trial Use on Nanjing West Road</h3>
<p>The long-rumored automatic traffic control lights will soon be installed and used in this city. The traffic authorities, considering the heavy traffic and congestion in the city center, especially the many handcarts, tricycles, and rickshaws that do not follow traffic rules, believe that the free movement of these vehicles may cause poor order once automatic traffic lights are implemented. In order to increase public awareness and understanding of traffic control methods, it is proposed to move the originally planned installation of lights to Nanjing West Road for trial use. The first phase is planned to be installed from Dihua North Road to Shaanxi North Road, at five locations: Dihua North Road, Huashan Road, Changde Road, Tongren Road, and Shaanxi North Road. The automatic traffic lights have three signals: red, yellow, and green. The yellow light prohibits vehicles still before the stop line from proceeding. Vehicles past the line can continue.</p>
<h3>French Ship Returns to Marseille Regularly; Smoleny Returns to Soviet Union Today</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] The French ship Andrée Lebon, which was found to be carrying smuggled goods by the Jianghai Customs, was delayed for half a month due to the crew's trial. It is now known that it left port at 3 p.m. last Friday and returned to Marseille.</p>
<p>The Soviet ship Atun, which previously delivered 1,000 tons of newspapers, was scheduled to load ore and other goods and return to Vladivostok after unloading. Due to delays in loading, it could not return to the Soviet Union as scheduled. Furthermore, the Smoleny arrived in Shanghai on the 23rd of this month and is currently docked at the Taikoo Wharf. Approximately 300 tons of outgoing goods, including ore and miscellaneous items, have been loaded, and it is scheduled to leave Shanghai at 2 p.m. today to return to Vladivostok.</p>
<h3>Trafficking Arms to Support Bandits: Large Organization Uncovered; Three Main Culprits Arrested</h3>
<p>The Songhu Garrison Headquarters recently received a report that there was a large organization in a certain district of this city that was trafficking arms to support bandits. The headquarters sent personnel to conduct a secret investigation and confirmed the report. They then took action a few days ago, immediately going to the address and arresting the three main culprits, Xue Yongqi and others. They also seized more than 4,000 rounds of various types of bullets. They were immediately taken to headquarters for interrogation. After confirming the facts, they have been sent to the military court for trial. It is reported that this organization had close ties with bandit areas and regularly searched for and purchased arms in various places, smuggling them to bandit areas for profit. Although the Garrison Headquarters has arrested the main culprits, the information provided is quite complex and involves many people. The Garrison Headquarters is currently conducting a thorough investigation, and there should be significant developments in the coming days.</p>

<h3>Residents of Disaster Area on Yanping Road Prohibited from Erecting Buildings</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] After the fire on Yanping Road, residents living in the area, such as Zhang Anqing, continued to erect buildings there. Despite repeated requests from creditors such as Xu Juxiang, they refused to move out. Xu and others filed a lawsuit in the civil court of the district court. Yesterday, Judge Zhao opened the trial and ruled that after providing a security deposit of 200 million yuan, the plaintiffs were granted permission to prohibit the debtors from building houses or other similar structures on the plot of land owned by the plaintiffs in the Fahua District, Xinzha Road, Yanping Road (formerly known as Jinjia Lane).</p>
<h3>Truth Comes Out in Case of Male Corpse Strangled on Zhongshan Road; Murderer Arrested</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] On June 2nd of last year, a man who had been strangled with a rope was found on the railway side of Wangjiazai Lane, Zhongshan Road, Zhabei. Two seals and a national identity card were found on his person, revealing that the deceased was named Wu Shanzhong, a rickshaw puller who resided at No. 26, Lane 451, Yuyao Road. At the time, the murderer was at large, and the case had not been solved. A few days ago, the Yulin Road Police Station received a tip that the main culprit in the case, Chen Hongxiang, was hiding in a shed on Yulin Road. Chief Zhou of the precinct ordered the troop leader Cheng Wengui and police officers Tian Changyuan and Li Canyin to rush to the scene and arrest Chen. According to Chen's confession, his father, Zhu Zhaoqing, and Wu Shanzhong were friends and both engaged in thievery. One day, Wu told Chen that he had found a job in a certain government agency and would soon start working there. Zhu, upon learning this, was deeply afraid that Wu would harm him once he became successful. Therefore, he gathered Ding Laizi, Hu Zhaowu, Huang Baozhang, and others to discuss a plan to murder Wu. On the evening of June 1st, they invited Wu to dinner at Zhu Zhaoqing's shed in Zhabei, got him drunk with alcohol, and then took a walk along Zhongshan Road. Unexpectedly, Chen used a rope to strangle Wu's neck, and the other accomplices helped to strangle him to death. They abandoned the body by the roadside and dispersed in a panic. However, Zhu Zhaoqing, who had committed numerous crimes, was arrested by the police station this spring and sentenced to three and a half years in prison by the court. The other accomplices, Ding Laizi and others, are at large and are currently being pursued.</p>

After receiving the report, Deputy Chiefs Zhou Jingbo and Ji Zhonglun of the station ordered the criminal investigation team leader, Guo Jitian, to start the investigation. They learned that the stolen gold powder was being sold in the printing market. As a result, officer Xu Zhenheng led police chief Ye Jintao and officers Chen Ronggui and others to search in all directions. They arrested seven criminals, Luo Wenxiang, Zhang Zhiyao, Tao Wanqun, Fang Shuncai, and others, in Room 228 of the New Hotel on Daxin Street, Hubei Road. All the stolen goods were recovered and have been returned to the company. The case has been fully investigated, and the criminals were transferred to the district prosecutor's office yesterday for further investigation.</p>
<h3>U.S. Military Assaults Rickshaw Puller</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] At around 11 p.m. last night, two U.S. Marine Corps soldiers, accompanied by their girlfriends, left a bar and hired two rickshaws at Maoming Road and Linsen Road to go to the International Hotel on Nanjing West Road. Upon arrival, one U.S. soldier paid 50 U.S. cents, while the other only paid 100,000 yuan in legal tender. When the rickshaw puller, Ma Yishan, refused to accept it, the U.S. soldier kicked Ma in the lower body, causing him to faint and fall to the ground. He was sent to the Sino-American Hospital by a police car and then transferred to the U.S. military hospital for treatment. The U.S. soldier who committed the assault was taken away by the shore patrol for investigation.</p>

<h3>Shanghai Has 4 Million Moviegoers Every Month; Tragic, Thrilling, and Technicolor Films Are Most Popular</h3>
<p>[Special Report from This Newspaper] In the city, watching movies is the most common form of entertainment, and movie theaters have the most customers among various entertainment businesses.</p>
<p>There are originally 47 movie theaters in Shanghai, but one of them, Jiuxing, is now showing Shanghai opera, so there are only 46 left. There are 22 first-run theaters, 5 second-run theaters, 15 third-run theaters, and 4 fourth-run theaters. The Guangming Theater has the most seats, with 1,951, and the Ping An Theater has the fewest, with only 500.</p>
<p>The number of first-run theaters has increased significantly after the war, which is an abnormal phenomenon. Before the war, the standard for first-run theaters was location and facilities. Now, any theater that can obtain the first-run rights to a film is upgraded to first-run. Therefore, except for a few "old" first-run theaters, the facilities of the so-called first-run theaters today are not up to standard.</p>
<p>What is the approximate number of moviegoers in the city? The total number of seats in the 46 movie theaters is over 40,000. With four showings a day, if every show is sold out, there are more than 180,000 moviegoers every day, and more than 5 million every month. In reality, this number should be reduced by 70% to 80%. According to the statistics for May, the total number of moviegoers in all movie theaters in the city was nearly 4 million. The audience statistics for several first-class movie theaters are as follows: Guangming 199,000, Queen 147,900, Majestic 146,000, Golden 120,000, Great Shanghai 116,000, Dahua 111,500, Huguang 100,850, and Cathay 100,320.</p>
<p>Different films have different audiences. Generally speaking, audiences for domestic films prefer tragic and moving plots. Therefore, "Eight Years of Separation" and "Before Dawn" are the best-selling films. Other films that are "bitter" generally appeal to people's tastes. For Western films, Technicolor and thrilling action films are the most popular, such as Errol Flynn's "Objective, Burma!", Esther Williams' "Bathhouse Beauty," and the magnificent and fantastical "Arabian Nights," all of which have been screened repeatedly and have remained popular for a long time.</p>
<p>Movie Theaters and Film Distributors Are Partners</p>
<p>The films shown in movie theaters are all supplied by film distributors. Movie theaters and film distributors can be said to be partners. The former has theaters, and the latter has films. Movie theaters attract film distributors with their facilities and location, while film distributors use their products to attract movie theaters and strive to select films that meet the needs of Shanghai audiences. Therefore, a star who is extremely popular in the United States may not be popular in China, and vice versa, a film that is very successful in China may not be a four-star or five-star film in its home country.</p>
<p>Historically, the films shown in each movie theater throughout the year were pre-determined with film distributors at the end of the previous year. Each contract is for about 20 to 30 films, often mixed with a few special films that are particularly appealing or have a particularly large production cost, which are required to be shown at a "special price," such as "Torpedo Alley," which was shown simultaneously at the Guangming and Cathay theaters in the past.</p>
<p>The Length of Screening Depends Entirely on Box Office</p>
<p>The length of the screening period for each film is determined by the number of viewers. The theater and the film distributor have historically stipulated that the film will only be replaced when the number of viewers drops by 50%. For example, if a movie theater has 1,000 seats and shows the film four times a day, the total number of seats is 4,000. If the number of viewers per day is more than 2,000, then the film must continue to be shown. However, sometimes the screening can be stopped by mutual agreement under the circumstances of reluctance to stop or an accumulation of new films. To avoid this situation, several movie theaters often show the same film simultaneously, which is also a major reason for the proliferation of first-run theaters today.</p>
<p>After the film distributor and the movie theater sign the contract, they deliver the films to the movie theater for screening one after another. The movie theater does not have to pay the film distributor when it receives the films, but the remaining amount after deducting the entertainment tax and stamp tax from the screening income is divided equally between the two parties. For example, if the ticket price is 300,000 yuan, the entertainment tax of 20% is 60,000 yuan, and the stamp tax of 5% is 12,000 yuan. The remaining amount is 114,000 yuan for each film distributor and movie theater. If the ticket price is 60,000 yuan, the entertainment tax is 12,000 yuan, and the stamp tax is 2,400 yuan. The remaining amount is 22,800 yuan for each film distributor and movie theater. The movie theater must also pay business tax, license tax, income tax, profit tax, construction donations, and other taxes.</p>
<p>Because the screening income is divided equally, both parties are very concerned about the income figures. Film distributors often send people to monitor the movie theater's business situation and are particularly active in advocating for adjustments to ticket prices. Whether it is Chinese or Western film distributors, due to the depreciation of the national currency and the huge costs, they all hope that ticket prices can be increased step by step.</p>
<p>Soaring Expenses and Endless Complaints</p>
<p>Movie theaters also have many difficulties: prices are soaring, expenses are increasing, and movie ticket prices cannot keep up with other prices. There are many people who watch movies without paying, and there are often "unfounded disasters." For example, the manager of a movie theater was summoned to the police station and detained for a day because someone was found smoking in the movie theater, and someone else was eating something with shells, so the movie theater manager was held responsible. But in fact, the theater party, in addition to posting "No Smoking" signs, has no authority to enforce the ban at all. It is no wonder that they want to complain about this kind of suffering in place of others.</p>
<p>Recently, the Social Affairs Bureau stipulated that 30% of the seats in first-run movie theaters should be priced-controlled seats, which is certainly a good thing for most citizens, but second-, third-, and fourth-run movie theaters are complaining endlessly because first-run theaters have more than 27,000 of the city's 40,000 seats, and the 30% price-controlled seats are more than 8,000, accounting for 42% of the seats in all second-, third-, and fourth-run movie theaters. Everyone tends to go to first-run movie theaters for the same price, so the business of second-, third-, and fourth-run movie theaters is greatly affected.</p>

<h3>Price Increases Continue Unabated; Food Market Temporarily Closed; Top Quality White Rice Sold at 22 Million Yuan Per Dan</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] Yesterday, the price increases in this city did not show any signs of easing. The retail price of top quality white rice has actually reached 22 million yuan per dan, and the retail prices of daily necessities are also rising steadily. The black market price of gold and banknotes is similar to the previous day, and the prices of 11 types of stocks hit their upper limits again at around 10 a.m.</p>
<p>In order to curb the rising prices, the municipal authorities consulted with brokers in the rice, oil, grains, and flour industries yesterday and asked them to withdraw from the market, because the authorities found that brokers' transactions on behalf of people outside the industry were fueling price increases. The brokers in the four industries accepted this request, so the markets for all four industries were closed yesterday. Whether trading will resume tomorrow will be decided by the Municipal Government's Economic Council. At the same time, a public notice was issued to citizens stating that those with food purchase permits issued by the Civil Survey Association in June can purchase one liter of rice per permit at rice shops in their respective districts, and the price should not exceed 100,000 yuan. The rice shops will also indicate the purchaser's baojia, name, and address on the purchase permit for verification purposes.</p>
<p>The reasons for the recent rise in prices are varied, but the main causes are the reversal of the war situation and the influx of speculative capital from the south. Therefore, how to curb the rising prices should also be approached from the root cause. Because the public's sentiments have been extremely volatile in the past two days, piecemeal measures to address the symptoms will be difficult to achieve the desired results.</p>
<h3>No Transactions Outside the Market Either</h3>
<p>Another report: Yesterday, many economic police officers were monitoring transactions at the north and south rice markets, so goods owners did not dare to display samples and quote prices. At the same time, the Social Affairs Bureau secretly notified the market to suspend trading, so there were no transactions yesterday. Before 10:30 a.m., traders had left one after another. The Civil Survey Association continued to supply rice as usual, with no changes in quantity or price. The markets for grains, cooking oil, and flour were all notified by the Social Affairs Bureau to suspend trading for one day, so people had dispersed before 11 a.m., and no transactions took place. Even outside the market, there were no transactions because no one was willing to sell. Buyers holding cash could not buy goods, and top quality white rice was nowhere to be found. Medium quality rice was 20 million yuan per shi, and low quality rice was 18 million yuan, and each person could only buy one or two liters. Flour sold for 5.8 million yuan (soldier ship flour), soybean oil for 520,000 yuan per jin, and vegetable oil for 600,000 yuan, and it was still difficult to buy more.</p>
<h3>High Opening Prices in the Market, Chinese Stocks Continue to Soar</h3>
<p>Chinese stocks continued to soar yesterday, presenting a fiery scene at the market opening, with nineteen stocks hitting their upper limit. Yong Yarn even briefly traded at a price below the limit several times. After police arrived at the market and off-market trading also subsided, things gradually calmed down.</p>
<p>The morning opened with high prices. Yong Yarn opened at 5150 yuan, initially rising to 5500 yuan before falling back to 5430 yuan. At 10:03 AM, Yong Yarn also announced its upper limit. Zhabei Yong Gong, Rong Feng, Lianhua, Huafeng, Hengfeng, Tongyi, Yongye, Sino-French, Xinhe, Zhongxing, etc., all hit their upper limits. The Meiya Match also approached its limit. Yong Yarn's grey market price was rumored to be as high as 5600 yuan. After police arrived and agency fees opened as high as 104 yuan and 110 yuan, off-market trading also subsided, causing the price to fall to 5300 yuan. The noon closing was 5360 yuan. Compared to the previous closing, Xinguang rose slightly, Xinyi and Wuhe rose by half a percent, and underwear rose by 10%. Yong Yarn, Sino-French, Xinhe, Jingfu, Qinxing, Huafeng, Yong Gong, Tongyi, Rongfeng, Jinglun, Guohuo, Shangwu, Xinhua, and Zhabei stocks hit their upper limits before receding slightly. Huaxin, Heng , Meiya Match, Zhongni, Yongye, Lian Di, and Yongye hit their upper limits. Unlisted stocks outside the market generally rose again, with cultural and banking stocks performing particularly well.</p>
<p>The capital increase of Lian'an Department Store has been approved and is scheduled to be listed for trading on the 28th, with a transaction unit of one million shares.</p>
<p>Government bonds rose slowly again yesterday. Unified C opened in the morning at 670,000, with a high price of 730,000. The noon closing retreated to 680,000, with approximately four million in transactions. Compared to the previous closing, A, B, and C bonds rose by 60,000 yuan, while D and E bonds rose by 70,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Foreign stocks: Yesterday's meeting location was interfered with by the police authorities, making it difficult to conduct business normally. Yisha retreated from a new high of 14.5 million to close at 13 million. Compared to the previous closing, Yisha, British United Paper, Yi , Shipping, and Steel stocks each rose by about 10%, while Jardine Matheson rose by half a percent, and the stock exchange did not rise much.</p>
<p>Another report: Short-term treasury bills will be traded as usual on the morning of June 30th, but there has been no clear public announcement regarding the market outlook for the 29th and 30th.</p>

<h3>Police Inspection at the Market, Cloth Trading Dormant, Fine Yarn Price Slightly Higher Than Yesterday</h3>
<p>Due to the continuous surge in cotton yarn prices, the authorities have taken notice. Members of the Economic Supervisory Group were dispatched to patrol the market, leading to a reduction in gatherings, scattered public sentiment, and dormant trading. It is also heard that the authorities will thoroughly inspect warehouses, and cotton yarn warehouse receipts must also be registered. Therefore, there were quoted prices in the market but a lack of buyers. 42-count Blue Phoenix fine yarn was priced at 900 million yuan, a slight increase of 30 million yuan compared to the previous day. Other counts of coarse and fine yarns also rose by varying amounts, ranging from 10 million to 30-40 million.</p>

The quantity and price are determined by the buyer and decided by the China Textile Corporation.</p>
<p>Woolens Firmly Rise</p>
<p>The market prices of woolens,毛織品 silk yarns, linings, and other piece goods rose again yesterday. Overcoat woolens were particularly popular, because the price of American-made Melton was estimated to be 10 million, while the China Textile Corporation's price for overcoat woolens and thin woolens was raised by an additional 10%, further reinforcing public sentiment and encouraging hoarding.</p>
<h3>Issuing Exchange Settlement Certificates, National Bank Clarifies Points of Attention</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] Yesterday, the Business Bureau of the Central Bank issued Circular No. 144 to all designated banks, stipulating the points of attention for issuing ordinary and special exchange settlement certificates. The contents are as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Designated banks may issue ordinary exchange settlement certificates when purchasing foreign exchange such as telegraphic transfers, drafts, and documentary bills, but not when purchasing from their domestic or foreign branches.</p>
<p>(2) Designated banks may not issue exchange settlement certificates for foreign exchange purchased from their branches or other designated banks, because the bank that originally purchased the foreign exchange has already issued an exchange settlement certificate.</p>
<p>(3) When foreign exchange purchased by foreign branches and agencies of designated banks (with a note indicating that it must be paid with national currency remittances) is directly entrusted to the designated bank for sale, it should be resold to the Central Bank immediately, and the Central Bank will issue a special exchange settlement certificate.</p>
<p>(4) The Central Bank may issue special exchange settlement certificates when purchasing the above-mentioned foreign exchange in item (3), but only if it meets one of the following conditions: A. The purchaser is the designated bank's spot foreign exchange, B. The designated bank's foreign exchange daily report has been accurately reported.</p>
<p>(5) Designated banks shall not issue exchange settlement certificates before actually purchasing foreign exchange, nor shall they delay issuing them after purchase for the sake of their own benefit. (However, if the designated bank has a debt relationship with the seller and withholds the exchange settlement certificate, the Central Bank has no intention of interfering.</p>
<p>(6) If there is any conflict between the Central Bank's previous circulars and this circular, the latter shall prevail.</p>
<h3>Abundant Supply of Raw Cotton, No Need for Work Reduction</h3>

After a thorough review, it was generally believed that the supply was absolutely not a problem, and the concern about "work reduction" was unnecessary. It was also learned that another meeting will be held next Monday to discuss countermeasures in detail, so that work reduction can be avoided.</p>
<p>Another report: The Yarn Control Committee held its tenth committee meeting at 3:00 PM yesterday afternoon, chaired by Acting Chairman Wang. First, the heads of various departments reported on their respective affairs, followed by a discussion of cases. The meeting adjourned at around 5:00 PM.</p>

<h3>Datia University Notice: Final Exam to Be Held Tomorrow, Students Who Fail to Take the Exam Then Will Have Summer Vacation</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] The Datia University semester examination was not held on the 24th due to the students' national movement, but the students requested a postponement to the 28th, which has been approved by the school. Yesterday, the two presidents of the university, Ou and Wang, issued a notice, stating that as the semester is coming to an end, if the exam is not taken on the 28th, the summer vacation will begin on the 29th to allow students to pack and return home. The school's notice is recorded below:</p>
<p>"In accordance with the school calendar, the final examination for this semester was originally scheduled to be held from the 21st of this month. Later, at the request of the students, it was approved to be postponed to the 24th. Unexpectedly, the students again delayed for various reasons and requested another postponement to the 28th (Monday). The school treats students like children, and as long as their studies are not wasted, it will not hesitate to accommodate them. Now, the final exam will be postponed again to the 28th. The subjects and times will be handled in accordance with the original schedule. I hope that you will cherish your studies, take the exam on time, and do not delay any further. If you fail to take the exam then, the summer vacation will begin on the 29th, and all students can pack and return home. As for the request to change to a national university, Chairman Sun stated that he will convene a meeting of the school board to discuss it and submit it to the Ministry of Education for approval. Nationalization and examinations can be carried out simultaneously and should not be contrary to the original purpose through unconventional actions. I hope you will understand the advantages and disadvantages and maintain order together. This is of utmost importance, this notice!"</p>
<h3>Guanghua's Change to Jinda University, Ministry of Education Statement Is Inaccurate</h3>

<h3>Tennis League Begins, Three Matches in Group A, Lianmei and Qunying Gather, Strong Strength</h3>
<p>The second Shanghai Tennis League, Group A, began this afternoon. Jinlan is on bye, and the remaining six teams are listed as follows:</p>
<p>Enpai vs. Lianmei at Enpai</p>
<p>Youlian vs. Tiyun at Youlian</p>
<p>Zhonghua vs. Deng at Zhonghua</p>
<p>Lianmei has gathered good players from the sea, with strong strength. Ye Guanxiong, Lin Baohua, and Li Wencheng, a good player from Indonesia, are all playing for the team. Mr. Li is an Indonesian national team player, but was unable to play due to illness. He will stay in Shanghai after the meeting and is currently serving in Northwest Airlines with Lin Baohua. He is expected to be one of the players with championship hopes in this season's Shanghai Open. Enpai won fifth place last year. Lianmei is now a different team, and Enpai seems unlikely to win. (The address of Enpai is in Lane 163, Changshu (Shanzhong) Road)</p>
<p>Youlian has the Ma brothers, Jingyao and Jingrong, as well as a group of young and new entrants such as Zhu Xianyu, and their strength is stronger than last year. Tiyun was the champion of the previous session. This season, personnel changes have slightly affected their strength. Facing Youlian today, the situation is bound to be tense. (The address of Youlian is No. 150 Difeng Road)</p>
<p>Zhonghua vs. Lvdeng is one of the most average groups of today's three groups. Both sides have foreign players to help. Liang Baokui, the old partner of Cai Guohong in the first group of Zhonghua, has not yet returned to Shanghai, which is inevitably slightly affected. Xu Shaomei and Shi Guiya of Lvdeng may have hopes of winning. The remaining four pairs are also evenly matched, and the scores must be very close. (The address of Zhonghua is No. 379 Jiaozhou Road (intersection of Wuding Road) in the Biochemical Factory)</p>

<h3>Last Night's Basketball Game: World Games Team Wins Narrowly Against Police Star Team, Unexpected Tension, 63-53</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] The World Games basketball team defeated the Police Star team last night with a score of 63-53, completing their fifth victory in Shanghai. The score was 24-23 in the first half, with the World Games team leading by one point. Although the Police Star team tried their best to resist, they were ultimately defeated due to slightly inferior skills. Except for the last few minutes, the score difference remained between two and three goals. The Police Star team gave their best effort, but the World Games team's performance was not particularly outstanding.</p>
<p>At 7:30 PM, Yu Ju-lu mistakenly reported the time, and Wang Jisi and Liu Hesheng officiated. The World Games team used Da Li and A Bao as guards, Wenhua as center, and Yu Jin, Shi Qiao, and Fu Bi on the left and right. The Police Star team countered with Wu Xinyun, Xu Zhongyi, Chuan Qixia, Wang Rongsheng, and Yao Wenyi. A Bao made two free throws, and Wenhua shot from a distance, giving the World Games team a 4-0 lead. The Police Star team quickly caught up, with the score at 8-7, a difference of one point. Xiao Wu continued to work hard, breaking through with a single shot, and the Police Star team took the lead for the first time at 13-12. A Di replaced Yu Jin, and the two sides engaged in a back-and-forth battle. At 21-20, the Police Star team took the lead for the second time. The score fluctuated rapidly, and the tension was unexpected. The score at halftime was 24-23, with the World Games team leading by half a point.</p>
<p>After switching sides, the World Games team replaced Li Zhenzhong with Huang Tianxi and launched an attack while the Police Star team's formation was unstable. Wenhua and Shi Qiao attacked from both sides. When the score was 42-35, Qi Xia was fouled out five times and replaced by Le Jiazhou. Both sides scored with long shots. In the last few minutes, the World Games team led by ten points. When Xiao Wu shot from a distance and Shi Qiao scored, the World Games team won with a score of 63-53 as the buzzer sounded.</p>
<h3>World Heavyweight Championship Fight: Joe Louis Remains Champion, Knocking Out Walcott in the Eleventh Round</h3>
<p>[United Press, New York, 25th] Heavyweight boxing champion Joe Louis and challenger Walcott held a championship match tonight at Yankee Stadium, with 50,000 spectators. The fight was scheduled for 15 rounds. Louis knocked out his opponent in the eleventh round, retaining the crown. After defeating Walcott tonight, boxing champion Joe Louis announced his retirement, saying, "For my mother's sake, tonight was my last fight."</p>
<p>[United Press, New York, 25th] World heavyweight boxing champion Joe Louis knocked out his challenger Walcott in the eleventh round at Yankee Stadium on the evening of the 25th, retaining his crown. Louis immediately announced his retirement after the victory.</p>
<p>Two minutes and fifty-two seconds into the eleventh round, Louis knocked out his black opponent. Since winning the world championship after defeating Braddock, the boxing king has defended his title 25 times, with no defeats. The first ten rounds of this battle were uneventful and dull. Only in the third round, Louis was knocked down by a fierce blow, counted to three, and then jumped up and resumed fighting, which was more spectacular. By the eleventh round, many believed that Walcott had performed well and had more points than Louis, and should win. Unexpectedly, the boxing king landed a heavy right punch, and Walcott fell and failed. The process of today's battle was dull, similar to the battle between Louis and Pellekaan two years ago, and the speed of the two battles was also unexpected.</p>
<p>Before knocking out his opponent, Walcott hit Louis in the head with a heavy right punch, and the boxing king seemed to be unsteady. Then the two exchanged blows at close range. Louis's left hook injured Walcott, and the latter fell on the ropes. Then the two 34-year-old black boxers exchanged blows. The Brown Bomber hooked with his left hand, and "Jesse" Walcott staggered and nearly fell. Louis hit again with his right hand, and Walcott stumbled and fell on the canvas, his back to the sky. After lying down for three seconds, Walcott supported himself with his hands and knees, trying to stand up, crawling along the stage, trying to straighten his feet. The referee counted to ten, and although Walcott had one knee off the ground, he still could not stand up and failed.</p>
<p>Louis and Walcott first met on December 5 last year at Madison Square Garden in New York, where Walcott made a splash and knocked Joe Louis down twice in a row. Although Louis won due to superior points, the opinions of the three judges and referees were not consistent.</p>
<p>In the third round, Old Hua swung his right fist into Louis's jaw, and the bomber actually fell to the ground, but immediately jumped up, seemingly unharmed, and immediately began to press his opponent.</p>
<p>Before the knockout, the two were evenly matched and tied. The United Press score sheet indicated that the two had each won four rounds and tied two rounds. Ticket revenue was approximately $700,000, with Louis receiving 40%, approximately $370,000, and Walcott receiving 20%, approximately half of Louis's earnings.</p>

<h3>Scenic Spots of Mount Hua</h3>
<p>— Photographed by Gu Dawei</p>
<p>Mount Hua in West Yue, is one of the most beautiful scenic spots in the Qinling Mountains. The five peaks stand tall, verdant and lush, with steep cliffs and majestic grandeur. The main peak overlooks the mountains, and to the north, the Yellow River is faintly visible, like a belt. The Wei River Plain outside Tongguan Pass is clearly visible. To the south, the Qinling Mountains are layered upon layers, hidden in the clouds, making them particularly magnificent.</p>

<h3>Reader Opinions: City Ferry - Dongdong Line, Pudong Residents Appeal for Improvement</h3>
<p>To the Editor: In recent years, the city's public utilities have achieved remarkable results under the management of the Municipal Public Utility Bureau, which is convenient for citizens. It is a pity that the city ferry is the only item that has not been improved. For example, the Dongdong Line (Dongmen Road - Dongchang Road), which is the most crowded with passengers, only has a single ferry operating after 7:00 PM every day, which is the time when factories are off work and offices are closed, and junior staff are returning home. Passengers are extremely crowded, and those who miss the ferry have to wait for half an hour. These exhausted staff and workers urgently need to return home to rest, standing on the pier, how can they not be anxious. Moreover, because the ferries are small and there are many passengers, they are extremely crowded, and petty thieves take the opportunity to run rampant. Even more serious is that the load is excessive, and safety is a major concern. As for the dim lights on the boat and the chaotic order, they are even more minor matters. I would like to take a corner of your newspaper to appeal to the company authorities to improve the situation and seek benefits for the citizens. I respectfully submit my humble opinions as follows: (1) The ferry service should be extended to 12:00 PM. (2) Two ferries should be used for crossing regularly to avoid overloading. (3) The lighting equipment on the boat should be improved to prevent petty thieves from running rampant. (4) An opinion box should be set up at the pier so that citizens can contribute their opinions at any time. (5) The frequency should be changed to once every ten minutes to allow more passengers to be transported and avoid crowding. (6) Improve pier management and pay attention to the safety of passengers.</p>

<h3>Thoughts on Buying Books</h3>
<p>— Bai Yong</p>
<p>No matter how expensive other things are, they all seem secondary to me, because the standard of living can be lowered as much as possible—besides, basic desires are not high. Only when book prices rise do I feel particularly pressured. A person with a special hobby can value the thing they love more than food and clothing. Is that not the meaning of pawning clothes for wine? Naturally, some people will scold, "You can only say such things after you've filled your belly." However, for a taste of life, if only one point can be satisfied, I'm afraid no one is willing to sacrifice it. It's always uncomfortable to be just a machine that digests food. The ancients said that gambling is better than doing nothing, which is also said with deep emotion.</p>
<p>Reading pictures represents my smoking, and night reading can even be seen as drinking old wine. Some people like to smoke cigars or drink baijiu, just like those who love to read Jia Yi's "Guo Qin Lun" and Xin Qiji's poems, they must cry bitterly. But I can't read lingering, sentimental things either. I'm simply terrified of empty talk and incomprehensible joys, sorrows, and loves. I don't have as much ability to imagine as others, and I can't fathom the taste of the Guanxi man and the seventeen- or eighteen-year-old girl playing the clapper. An honest person only seeks to understand a little truth. However, history is a specialized tool for lying and deceiving people. So, I look at it little by little from trivial things. If I can string together many pearls, it may be worth more than a city. It's a pity that there are very few people in our team who can create a general principle to give people an overall impression. I might as well sigh in imitation of someone else's tone: "How difficult it is to read books!"</p>
<p>It is certainly a good feeling to throw away a book when tired at noon, but having a job makes it difficult to lie leisurely in the north window. Therefore, before I can throw away the book, I have already hurried into a dream. There is also the fact that a house is worth a gold bar. To have a bright window and a clean desk to enjoy the beauty alone is also a fantasy. Everyone has different interests. You want to read a book, but he insists on listening to the radio. Otherwise, when guests come, you have no choice but to flee, which is more deadly than urging harmony and ruining the fun. Only after 10 o'clock, when everyone is in bed, does the world completely become self-managed. It's better not to turn off the lights and sacrifice a little of other people's sleeping time. You can get about two hours of enjoyable reading, which is so mellow and full of flavor, just like being drunk on old wine. Even on the road to Handan, the stories and characters in the book continue to play out.</p>
<p>Some time ago, the Commercial Press had a big sale. We, who usually gasp when we see the price of books, felt as if we had been granted amnesty. However, just like buying rationed goods, we still couldn't get the first share. Before 9 o'clock in the morning, several people were lined up outside the gate, waiting to "show off their skills." Fortunately, I don't buy much in the way of novels, so I wasn't affected as much. However, I have already found many cheap books with plum blossom stamps in many used bookstores near Henan Road. The original price tag was torn off or wiped off, and the amazing price was written on it! For example, Feng Chengjun's translation of "Dorson's History of the Mongols" was said to be abundant in the first few days, but later there was not a single copy to be found. They were all taken away. Can this also be called flowing into the black market? On the first day, I bought nearly twenty kinds of annual biographies, because biographical literature is my favorite, but the price was over a million! Many famous works in the field of history are not asked about. For example, I have not seen anyone buy all of Feng's translated "Collected Studies on the History and Geography of Central Asia and Southeast Asia." This proves that under today's living conditions, too specialized knowledge has prevented people from daring to take action, and unpopular fields will always remain unpopular.</p>
<p>37 million to buy the entire "Sibu Congkan" reduced-size edition, which is less than three dan of rice. According to pre-war prices, it was only 30 yuan, which is really extremely cheap. But if you take a look around, you can see that there are very few people asking about it. Is it because of low purchasing power? Or are the rich people of poor quality? In the past, when a rich merchant made a fortune, he would buy a copy of the "Twenty-Four Histories" to decorate his living room. Nowadays, nouveau riche probably no longer have this idea, because although book prices have risen, they can't keep up with gold notes. No matter what they buy, they must first calculate the rate of price increase! Also, big nouveau riche look down on these "poor people's beauty" things. They would rather spend gold bars to buy "Essence of Ancient Chinese Bronze," "A Korean Archaeological Atlas," or jade-inlaid rotten hemp paper, large-character, white-paper classics printed by the official publishing houses, which can be used to act like an expert and can be sold for a higher price. Incorporating elegance into business is also a new trend today.</p>
<p>The price of newsprint is breaking the 10 million mark, so printing books is inherently losing money. Paper with printed words is not as expensive as blank paper, which can be transported back and forth in the warehouse as a bargaining chip. Therefore, large bookstores are not willing to publish things. They just take out some old books to respond to the situation. This is too much of a threat to those of us who must have spiritual food. In the past few days, the publications of the Academia Sinica have been reduced in price. I have exhausted all my resources to replenish the "Collected Papers of the Institute of History and Philology," but I ran three times for the twentieth volume, "In Memory of Mr. Cai Yuanpei's Death," but it still hasn't been published. The transportation costs alone have cost me over 100,000. Although I can't help but feel resentment towards the bureaucratic bookstore, it is a great fortune that they are willing to print such purely academic works, so I dare not demand anything else.</p>
<h3>Franklin and Beds</h3>
<p>— Painting Studio</p>
<p>Benjamin Franklin, one of the founding fathers of the United States, was not only a great politician and diplomat, but also a writer and scientist. He can truly be called a man of all talents. But he had a special view on the matter of sleeping. He advocated that everyone should have two beds. He said that we often wake up in the middle of the night and cannot sleep until dawn because the bedding is too hot. Therefore, he prepared two beds every night, each with bedding. When one bed was "too hot" to sleep in, he quickly jumped to the other bed while still sleepy. It is said that this way of sleeping is the most comfortable and beneficial to health.</p>
<h3>In Memory of Chen Sanli</h3>
<p>— Ye Gongchuo</p>
<p>His spirit made mountains and rivers dim, unable to stretch,</p>
<p>Heaven ordained him to be a poet.</p>
<p>His body sustained the situation of an era,</p>
<p>Tears exhausted in the Central Plains from war and devastation.</p>
<p>Life and death, who knows the changing fortunes?</p>
<p>Coming and going originally eliminate grudges and affections.</p>
<p>Heartbroken, a traveler south of Yingcheng,</p>
<p>Even in the earth, he should still mourn for me.</p>
<p>I cannot bear to recall the covenant of forty years,</p>
<p>The high pavilion, singing and appreciating the remaining pieces.</p>
<p>Distinguishing between right and wrong with all our hearts, condemning what all men point to,</p>
<p>Competing for a move first, happily arguing about skills.</p>
<p>Broken dreams can hardly form another world,</p>
<p>Alone, I plan to knock on the heavy spring.</p>
<p>What can be accomplished by bending and stretching like a dragon in the deep?</p>
<p>I gaze at Yan and Yun, a hundred thoughts surge.</p>
<h3>Allegory</h3>
<p>— Mao Yi</p>
<p>Since the formation of private property, the evil thought of selfishness has taken root in the hearts of human beings, and it can be said that it has become deeply ingrained to this day. However, as the history of the world has evolved to this day, it is more necessary than ever for everyone to awaken. Otherwise, humanity may only have the dead end of mutual destruction.</p>
<p>Here is a lesser-known Persian allegory, and its revelation should have a sobering effect:</p>
<p>In the year 600 AD, there was a learned and knowledgeable sage. One day, he was taken to heaven in a dream. In heaven, he saw two doors. One door was written with: "The Hall Not Difficult by the True God"; the other door was written with: "The Hall Admired by the True God."</p>
<p>Entering the first door, the sage found many people seated at a great feast. However, the atmosphere here was not pleasant and joyful, but rather bleak and depressed, because everyone's left arm was tied to their side, and everyone's right arm was tied with a long-handled spoon with a belt, and the belt was tied so that their elbows could not bend freely. Therefore, although their spoons could scoop up the delicacies and delicacies set before them, they could not put them into their mouths. Everyone could only sigh and remain there with frowning brows.</p>
<p>Entering the second hall, the atmosphere was full of joy. Everyone was feasting. Although the people here had their arms tied in the same way as the people in the other hall, unable to put food into their mouths, the True God had given them wisdom. Therefore, everyone scooped up the delicacies in front of them and generously fed them to the people next to them. As a result of the alternate feeding, everyone's appetites were satisfied.</p>
<p>From this dream, the sage offered a lesson: On earth, the hungry are those who only think of themselves; as for those who feast, they are those who help each other.</p>
<p>"Those who can give can exist" - selfishness will destroy humanity.</p>
<h3>Strange Tales of Taxes</h3>
<p>— Huanren</p>
<p>This time, I came from Shanghai to live in the hometown of Xishi. I happened to hear from my neighbors that the amount of taxes and the variety of items borne by the people here were astounding. I couldn't help but recall the various strange and bizarre taxes recorded in the history of China and foreign countries, ancient and modern. For a moment, I was so excited that I recorded one or two from the history of foreigners with high noses and blue eyes, for the reference of the lords who are in charge of tax collection:</p>
<p>(1) Beard Tax - This is the "achievement" of Peter the Great of Russia, which was not abolished until Empress Catherine came to power. It specifically stipulates that those who do not pay the tax must cut off their beards.</p>
<p>(2) Funeral Tax - Practiced in Romania, the maximum amount is 3,000 yuan.</p>
<p>(3) Piano Tax - Practiced in Italy, 50 lira is charged for each piano.</p>
<p>(4) Billiards Tax - Also practiced in Italy, the maximum amount is 250 lira.</p>
<p>(5) Title Tax - This is a "good tax" in Spain, levied specifically on people with titles. A duke must pay several thousand yuan each year - I sincerely hope that the tax collection lords will pay special attention and follow suit.</p>
<p>(6) Window Tax - Collected in England from 1697 to 1851. The tax collection lords only need to count the number of windows outside each house, which is indeed a "piece of cake" tax collection.</p>
<p>(7) Hearth Tax - A tax of two shillings was levied for each stove, which was also practiced in England from 1662 to 1689.</p>
<p>(8) Pants Tax - This was a harsh tax in 17th century England, which was actually a servants' tax.</p>
<p>(9) Bible Tax - Someone once said in the London Times a long time ago that the Bible would be taxed, but this has not yet been implemented. This may be sarcasm or a prediction. I dare not make a decision on my own and can only wait for the facts to unfold.</p>
<h3>The Taste of Essays</h3>
<p>— Li Chu</p>
<p>Food nourishes the body, essays nourish the spirit. Comparing essays to eating is not entirely inappropriate. Here are the flavors I have discerned from tasting recent essays:</p>
<p>(1) Lu Xun: Lu Xun enjoys the reputation of being China's Gorky. He has long held the reins of the literary world. His writing excels at refutation, with a mix of pungency, bitterness, and astringency, especially in his miscellaneous essays. His essays are like a cup of effective but bitter traditional Chinese medicine.</p>
<p>(2) Lin Yutang: The humorous master's writings are abundant and heavily influenced by Western style. His essays are like Western cuisine, not bad in terms of nutrition and presentation, but somewhat lacking in flavor.</p>
<p>(3) Xu Zhimo: Xu Zhimo is overflowing with talent, a born poet. His writings also have a strong Western influence, but with a uniquely rich and sweet taste. His prose and new poetry are undoubtedly like chocolate candy.</p>
<p>(4) Yu Dafu: Dafu's writing is like the man himself: unconstrained, free-spirited, and without affectation. Reading his diaries published in "Leisurely Books" particularly reveals his genuine personality. His essays are like everyday home-cooked meals.</p>
<p>(5) Feng Zikai: Mr. Zikai is an artist and a religious figure. His writing is sincere and intimate, like family members casually chatting at home, without pretension or pomposity. It's like vegetarian dishes from a temple kitchen, subtle, fragrant, and clean, beneficial to both body and mind.</p>
<h3>Morning Dew</h3>
<p>— Y</p>
<p>Life is a string of suffering; living is being taught how to endure it with a smile.</p>
<p>People often argue because they are not good at debating.</p>
<p>Worry is like a rocking chair; it keeps you busy going back and forth, but you never get anywhere.</p>
<p>Who dares to say they are not in a dream but laughs at others' yearning for dreams?</p>
<p>A passionate lover clings to the dream world; a philosopher waits for the dream to end; a common person doesn't realize it's a dream.</p>
<h3>Preface to the Fifth Edition of the New Provincial Map of China</h3>
<p>— Weng Wenhao</p>
<p>The New Provincial Map of China was created to commemorate the 60th anniversary of Shen Bao. The first edition was published in the 22nd year of the Republic [1933]. With its accurate position, clear elevation, thorough references, and distinct colors, it became popular for a time and was repeatedly reprinted to serve its readers. By the 28th year [1939], it had been printed to the fourth edition, but due to the ongoing war of resistance, although there was a great need, it was not reprinted. It has been ten years since the fourth edition. The gentlemen in charge of Shen Bao believe that the map is of great importance and that the previous efforts should not be interrupted. They have spared no expense, engaging Mr. Zeng Shiying and Mr. Fang Jun to collect data, compile, and create this fifth edition of the new map. Now, after victory, with Taiwan and the Northeast returned to our territory, this new edition of the map commemorates the solidity of our nation. The task is weighty and the road is long, worthy of remembrance.</p>
<p>The compilation of a map depends on survey data. In the past ten years, China's longitude and latitude measurements have increased significantly; topographic, hydrological, geological, and engineering maps have also contributed much; in addition, there is aerial surveying by the United States, and maps of the Northeast and Taiwan by Japan. The Central Geological Survey has collected much of this data, and Mr. Zeng and Mr. Fang have also widely collected it for reference. Therefore, the foundation upon which this fifth edition is based is far superior to previous editions. As for the division of provinces in the Northeast, the correction of place names of cities and counties, and the addition of railways and seaports, all recent geographic additions have been carefully verified and incorporated.</p>
<p>The compilation of a map also depends on the application of cartography. Compiling a new map is not merely copying existing maps. Elevation must have a unified standard, projection must use a specific method, and there should be a practical understanding of terrain and rivers. The quality of the compilation depends on the knowledge of the mapmakers. Mr. Zeng and Mr. Fang have devoted themselves to mapmaking for many years. Mr. Zeng also participated in mapmaking tasks for the US government during the war, gaining more experience with modern methods. With these two gentlemen in charge of the compilation of this new edition, great results can be expected. Recalling how Zou Daijun of Hunan devoted himself to European cartographic methods because of his involvement in border negotiations, which later had successors, the maps of Yaxin began there. The Shen Bao commemorative map was initiated by Ding Wenjiang with his geological mapping passion. Now, with the efforts of Mr. Zeng and Mr. Fang, this new edition has been completed, surpassing previous ones. This is a noteworthy event in the history of Chinese cartography.</p>
<p>The compilation of a map should also emphasize the recognition of facts and avoid the misrepresentation of established theories. Ancient Chinese mapmaking excelled at recording water but struggled with depicting mountains, mistakenly believing that there must be mountains between two rivers, not knowing that mountains are often cut across by waterways; mistakenly believing that the types of terrain are limited to mountains and plains, not knowing that plateaus, hills, basins, deserts, and alluvial islands have different origins and unique importance. In the past, relying on ideal theories often led to neglecting the underlying facts. Now, using modern methods to create maps based on reality, the facts are clear and the truth is very obvious. This will also help to improve our knowledge of the country's actual conditions.</p>
<p>Mr. Zeng and Mr. Fang will continue to work tirelessly on mapmaking; the Shen Bao will continue to provide assistance so that it can be published. The first step in this achievement is this fifth edition of the new map; publication is imminent, and I dare to introduce it.</p>
