<p>〔本報北平廿五日電〕新民戰事廿四日達最高潮，入夜尤烈，守軍集中全力應戰，死守重要據點，迄廿五日雙方砲火聲與空軍投彈聲齊鳴，一片混戰。外電傳新民守軍轉進說尙嫌過早，惟形勢確屬危急。巨流河方面戰事慘烈萬分，傳守軍主力已轉進，殿後部隊仍苦鬥中。空軍猛炸巨流河新民間，阻共匪前進。又興隆店北自廿四日起，連續二有戰事，該處共匪企圖牽制守軍及阻撓國軍增援新民。</p>

<h3>局面一新軍心已穩　東北形勢可扭轉　在平某要員談東北現局</h3>
<p>〔本報北平廿五日電〕參與最高政治圈之某要員，今在平以輕鬆之心情接見記者·渠以一過來人」目光，旁觀東北現局，並以打麻將爲喩稱：半年來東北軍事，迭遭失利，並非共匪勢强·國軍力弱，而是我們連打幾張錯牌，才讓下家「和」了。現在東北局面一新，軍心已穩，如再鼓起士氣，不貪得大牌，只要連續弄幾個小「和」，也就可把局面慢慢扭轉了。他認爲軍心士氣比軍隊數量更重要，目前東北軍隊不算太少，新一·新六兩軍尤其强勁可用。對起用東北耆老宿將，在目前所能發生的作用，他不願輕予估價。他强調北寗路打通的重要，至於營口，在補給上則沒甚麽價値，因爲只能停泊二三千噸的船。</p>
<h3>智識份子與政府　隔閡之說不正確　董顯光對司徒雷登談話之辯正</h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿五日電〕政院新聞局廿五日下午三時半舉行之記者招待會中有人詢董局長：「司徒大使曾稱，中國智識份子茍能成立進步團體，以激勵政府決策，則和平當可增進，閣下對此有何論評？有謂中國政府與智識份子之間，隔閡頗深，是否正確？」董氏答稱：「司徒大使深悉我國敎育界之情勢，本人固表欽佩；惟大使所稱我國智識份子與政府不能合作一說，似屬言之過甚。我國正如其他國家，容有若干智識份子，在情感上未能同情政府之措施，其中多數恐對任何政府皆將取批評之態度，是或即　伯納氏所謂「專家抗辯者」（PROFESSIONAL　AGAINST）性情之流露歟？我國智識界有此直言之士，政府至感欣慰，蓋此實爲思想健全發揮之表現，隨時能以衡量政績之準繩，提供政府，然吾人因此推斷謂中國智識份子多數反對政府，則未免言過其實矣，迄今尙無此種跡象可尋，若因中國大學學生與世界各國大學生取同樣能態度，遇事指摘，不滿現狀，即謂中國已向左傾，其立論之牽强缺乏依據，有類因美國哈佛大學內有哈佛社會主義協會之組織，遽指美國業巳全國傾向馬古斯主義，揆諸事實，中國智識份子正多數與政府眞誠合作，其言行之所以鮮見報章披露者，實因彼等鮮願虛耗時間，以從事自我宣傳耳，然其爲我政府砥柱之價値無損也。茲願向諸位確切保證，智識份子將與政府繼續合作，蓋彼等深知唯有在國民政府治下，始能獲得生存與自由，進而謀求政治與經濟之改一革，如國民政府不幸失敗，中國即將喪失獨立，而鞏固民主政體之希望，更無法實現矣。</p>
<h3>李鐵錚抵京</h3>
<p>即晋謁王外長等　報吿暹政局僑情</p>
<p>〔本報南京廿五日電〕我駐暹羅大使李鐵錚，離曼谷返國述職，廿五日下午一時半經港飛返首都，並即至外部與王外長，劉，葉兩次長，及亞東司長黄正銘等，談政變後暹政局民情及華僑近况極詳。據李氏語本報記者：渠此行任務，爲將暹政變原因，經過，及後果，報吿政府當局，以供參考。渠稱：暹政變時，華僑生命財產無甚損失，三月來新政府對外關係之處理相當愼重，關於華僑敎育，我堅持雙方條約繼利，華僑有敎育子弟之自由，僑校懸旗之爭執，我僑方曾表示可將我國旗與暹旗同時升降，然暹報紙頗多歪曲報導，故迄尙在爭持中，此行動顯不友好。然運華暹米數量，則較任何時期爲多。李氏論暹政局謂：大選時投票人少爲一事實，但主事者頗爲公正，現乃寬亞拜横正受命組閣，惟鑾披汶派仍具實力，與乃間並非究全諧合，新閣是否可於廿六日順利出現，尙朱可逆料。我國對暹態度，須俟其新政府出現後，方可考慮決定。渠是否返任，及何時返任，亦將候命，再定行止。至曼谷外交情形，尙無任何一國採單獨行動，英國爲在暹投資及利益最多者，政變初期影響頗劇，後經調整，情况巳大致轉好，現英國對遜政策，已可與中美採同一步驟。</p>

<p>〔聯合社靑島廿五日電〕新任美國西太平洋艦隊司令白吉爾，今日在旗艦「埃斯特」號後甲板正式就職，儀式簡單，美國海軍官兵與中國高級軍官均到塲觀禮，並由前任司令柯克面交印信。柯克之四星旗旋自旗桿卸下，易以白吉爾之三星旗，交卸儀式於是吿終。柯克即與白氏等一一握手離艦而去，定於明日乘運輸艦「巴斐爾」號返國。西太平洋艦隊轄境包括馬利亞納羣島以西之太平洋區域。白吉爾在此司令部，距蘇聯佔領下之旅順大速不足三百空哩，中美要人認爲蘇軍一旦集中該兩港，則美國在靑島留駐海軍實關重要。在中國本土及朝鮮間三百哩海面巡邏之艦隊，可以有效的攔截黄海北面任何海軍船隻。白吉爾戰時任職於聯合參謀部，智勇雙全，曾率領部隊進攻冲繩島及日本本土。</p>

<p>專論</p>
<h3>美援與自助</h3>
<p>— 程天放</p>
<p>期待巳久的美國援華法案，終於在本月十八日由杜魯門總統用特別咨文向美國國會提出了。咨文中說明：自國民政府成立後二十年來，美國對她不斷予以支持，在對日戰爭中和日本投降後，美國更給予中國多量的援助。其理由就在「中美兩國人民有多年眞誠友誼，復有悠久的商業和文化聯繫以及密切無間的合作。美國人民對中國人民素極敬仰，對於他們所遭遇的種種考騐和困難深表同情。美國久已承認，中國的安定對太平洋及全世界持久和平，極關重要。中國因地大人衆已成爲國際關係上一項重要因素。中國有優良傳統和文化，並有爲數衆多和精力充沛的民衆。我們切盼中國强大進步，俾對國際力量的增强，能作充分貢獻。」所　出的具體辦法，則是請求國會核准以五億七千萬美元作爲一九四九年六月三十日以前的援華款項。此項款項，可爲借款，也可爲贈予。其中五億一千萬美元，用來購買中國最需要的貨物，如小麥，食米，棉花，石油及石油產品，肥料，烟草，藥物，非鐵金屬，和鋼鐵產品，以及機器零件等。六千萬美元用來資助大規模的工業，如同－海電力公司，粤漢鐵路，贛西和湖南湘潭媒礦，及可能包括台灣的糖廠，肥料廠，水泥廠，和碼頭設備等。綜合的講，這次美援是物資而不是現金，是分期交付而不是一次付淸。牠的目的是在「予中　政府在經濟衰落中以喘息的時間，俾能設法建立較爲穩定的經濟情形。」因此美援的條件就是由中政府向美國保證「將採取切於實際的經濟財政和其他措置，以期達到經濟穩定和復興的目標。」如果美國認爲中國政府沒有實行此項保蹬，就可以隨　停止此項援助。</p>
<p>杜魯門總統咨文提出後兩天，馬歇爾國務卿在衆議院外交委員會討論援華計劃時作證。他首先朗讀一個預備好了的演辭，隨後又答覆各議員的質問，並提出了經濟援華計劃的文件。由這些演辭問答和文件中，我們更可以看出美國政府現階段的對華政策。馬歇爾將軍雖承認中國現正在嚴重困難當中，需援助，美國亦予以援助，但強調「中國問題須由中國人民本身解決……。援華計劃不應包括實際担保中國經濟之前途，美國亦不應因採取行動，致造成中國政府之行爲和其政治經濟軍事各方面直接負責任之地位。」在他的演辭和答問中，馬歇爾將軍對於中國的政治和軍事情形都加以嚴格的批評，認爲中國政府沒有接受他在華一年中不斷的建議，對政治軍雄予以改善，致造成今日嚴重的局勢。他又認爲援華與援歐不同，因爲「歐洲各國有健全之基礎，可資建議，但中國的情形則混亂不堪無人能預定將來的局面。」所以如果國會不能同時解決此兩件事，則應該用全部精力先通過援歐法粱，然後再來討論援華。他更暗示美國目前不預備援助中國改革幣制，因爲這需要甚多的基金，而此種基金在目前中國內戰正在進行之時，大半將爲浪費。他指出共產黨軍隊已造成可怖之破壞，以達到該黨公開宣布之目的，卽促成中國經濟的崩潰。他一方面承認長江以北的省區或有淪入共產黨掌握之可能，但奇怪的，他同時又說中國共產黨軍隊，獲得外援一節，並無瞪據。</p>
<p>援華法案提出後，這一週來，美國朝野人士都熟烈地討論這個問題。各方面的意見，歸納起來，大槪可分爲四派：一派是美國共產黨和他的同路人，例如遠東民主政策委員會，以及雖非此種人物，而不知不覺做了共產黨工具的，如同華萊士先生和他所領導的美國進步公民組織（Progressive　Citizens　of　America）。他們認爲中國共產黨是民主的，進步的政黨，而國民政府則是頑固的，反動的。獨裁的政府。他們願意看見國民政府的崩潰與中國共產黨的成功。他們的心理是最好美國來一個一百八十度的轉變，援助中共，推翻政府。這一點做不到，至少美國也應採取袖手政策（Hands-off　Policy），讓中國自己攪去。所以他們對於任何援華計劃，都是採堅決反對的態度。不過這一部分人數，在美國的總人口中，眞是微乎其微，他們的主張不會發生多大的影響。另一派包括國會裏面的共和黨議員，如同參議員范登堡·塔虎脫·衆議院議長馬丁·衆議員伊登·周以德·史密斯等許多先生，以及全美斯克立甫霍華德系的報紙。他們贊成援華法案，但表示不滿意：因為援助的數目太少了，而且限於經濟，沒有包括軍事和財政援助在內，再加上拖延到明年六月付淸，恐怕有緩不　急的危險。第三派可以紐約時報·前鋒論壇報等有力報紙做代表。他們贊成這個法案，但是採穩健的論調覺得援華能否發生效果，要看中國本身的努力而定。第四派是另一羣有力的報紙，如同華盛頓郵報，巴鐵摩爾太陽報，基督敎科學箴言報等。他們是反共產主義的，但是他們不贊成在這個時候援助中國；因爲他們對中國太失望了，認爲在中國政治經濟沒有大改革以前，援助中國，等於以金錢擲諸虛牝。</p>
<p>我們以中國人的眼光來看此次的美援，有些甚麼感想呢？就援華法案的精神講，我們對於盟邦幫助中國渡過經濟難關的好意是衷心感謝的，尤其杜魯門總統咨文中洋溢看對中國人民的同情和友誼，這種同情，這種友誼，是値得我們千萬珍視的，抗戰勝利以後，中共，美共，和他們的同路人在中美兩國不斷的做挑撥難間的工作，只要中美兩國人民的關係，一天比一天疏遠，友誼一天比一天淡薄，國際共產主　　　東亞的野心，就更易於實現。我們讀了杜　門總統的咨文，知道在這一點上，共產黨的奸計並未得售，這是使我們深感欣慰的。但是就援華法案的內容講，我們就感覺不能完全滿意，我認爲美國援助中國肅清共禍，使得中國成為遠東和平的安定力，一方面需要精神上的鼓勵，一方面需要實質上的支特，而實質又可分爲軍事，財政，經濟三類，這三類的援助，相輔相成，缺一不可。現在援華法案中祗有經濟援助一項，對於軍事和財政都付之闕如，這實在是重大的缺陷。正如周以德氏所講，一隻鼎需要三隻足去支持，現在只安了一隻足，如何能站穩呢？當然五億七千萬美元的物資流入中國對於中國的國民經濟，自然有相當的補益，但是這只是一種救急（Relief）。而不是一種治療（Cure），決不能根治中國嚴重的病症。因爲軍事形勢如果不能好轉，脫繮之馬的通貨澎漲不能採用改革幣制的辦法去遏止，那末嚴重的經濟危機，叩使暫時和緩，不久還是要發生的。有些人希望好好　用這筆美援，做到停止通貨澎漲和穩定物價，我們只要看援華法案根出後這一週來物價反而猛漲，就可知道這種看法似乎太樂觀了。</p>
<p>尤其使我們驚訝的，是以馬歇爾將軍這樣一個軍事家兼政治家，現在又負了世界政治上一個重大責任，而對於中國局勢，似乎到現在還有不澈底明瞭的地方。他既說中國問題須由中國人民本身解決，又說中共獲得外援並無證據。由這些話來推測，很易使人相信，馬歇爾將軍的看法是中共只是中國內部的問題，而不是世界問題的一部分。假如馬將軍與是如此看法，那實在是一件憾事！誠然，中共之所以如此猖獗，中國政治的不良，做了許多爲叢驅雀的工作；但是中共本身却無疑地是世界共產主義的一環他所引起的問題，就是世界問題的一部分，而決不是單純的中國國內問題。中共問題如何解決，很迅速地會影響整個世界的和平，這不但與希臘問題性質相同，而且較希臘問題影饗要大得多。至於說中共未得外援，那更是自欺欺人的笑話！我們只要問：李立三何以能由莫斯科跑回東北去做東北共產黨的指導者？東北在蘇軍佔領的時期，何以能允許共軍源源地進去？日本關東軍的軍械何以會落到共軍手裏？今天　北共軍中何以有武裝齊備的韓共參戰？把這些問題一加思索，那縣任何人都會自尋答案了。</p>
<p>美國還有一部分人，認爲共產主義是一個思想和生活的問題，我們要在思想和生活方面去對付他，不能以武力去消滅共產主義。因此，他們反對中國政府以武力對付共產黨，也就反對以軍事力量援助中國。這些，人眞有點書獃子氣息，知共一而不知其二。我們承認一切主義，一切思想，不是武力可以消滅的。武力之不能消滅共產主義，也正如武力之不能消滅法西斯主義納粹主義一樣，我們要消滅這類表面不同而實質相同的集權的思想，只有用敎育方法來養成人類健全的思想，同時用經濟改造的方法使得人類能够得到衣食住行的幸福，一切歪僻的主義自然無人去盲從她了。但是對付擁有數十萬軍隊稱兵作亂的中國共產黨，那　和對付單純的共產主義不同。我們不能以武力去消滅主義，但同時也決不能單以思想和生活去消滅巳經形成的叛變武力。中國今日不能不用武力來消滅共產黨，遠之正如美國南北戰爭時林肯大總統之不能不用兵，近之也正如第二次大戰時同盟國家不能不用武力來戰勝德國和日本一樣。林肯大總統不用兵，美國也就不能成爲一個統一的民主共和國，同盟國家如果不能戰勝德日，整個世界就要爲德日所征服：中國不消滅共產黨，整個中國就要爲共產黨所控制！</p>
<p>美國人儘管對中國有許多錯誤的看法，因而影響到他們對華政策的不够積極，然而我們却應該儘量反躬自省，不可專責備他人。自從抗戰勝利以來，我們寳在做了許多爲親者所痛，爲仇者所快的事體！我們的政治，軍事，財政，經濟各方面弱點，實在太多了，所以共產黨才有可乘的機會，來儘量發展。往者巳矣，我們要從今天起做亡羊補牢的工作，以謀挽救這嚴重的局面。我們盼望人家的援助，就必須充分地自助，所以凡是馬歇爾將軍等所指出的缺點，不論牠是否完全正確，都可以做我們的他山之石。在千鈞一髮的時候，尤其要排除萬難，在政治，軍事，財政，經濟各方面實施澈底的改革。這不僅能加强國際的好感，而且也能收拾國內的民心。政府如果能不顧一切障碍，朝此方向走去，我想美援數目雖則不够多，然而未嘗不可充分利用，收相當的效果。而且這次物資援助之後，其他方面的援助也許可源源而來，中國的局勢才有逐漸明朗化的希望。如果政治，軍事，財政，經濟不能配合美援去改善，到明年六月以後，局勢與現在同樣嚴重，甚至更加嚴重，那麽這五億七千萬美元等於未發生作用，適中了共產黨和同路人之口。中國的前途是福是禍，對於世界是維護和平，還是製造混亂，一一部分固然要看我們的友邦對中國的認識是否充分，行動是否積極，而大部分還是要靠我們自己選擇！</p>

<h3>國防部新聞局發表　最近戰局剖視　東北國軍不難轉處有利態勢</h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿五日電〕國防部新聞局廿五日發表二月十八日至二十四日之最近戰局剖視全文如次：</p>
<p>東北方面</p>
<p>共匪在東北的蠢動是利用嚴寒的氣候，乘營口葫蘆島封凍，作截斷交通，孤立瀋陽的竄犯，他仗恃着國際的支援，和後方交通綫的靈活，屢敗屢戰，以大吃小，從不作堂堂正正的主力決戰，由吉長會載起，直到現在爲止，沒有離開這個戰略原則。　最近自遼陽戰事之後，緊接即向鞍山進攻，目前週十二日開始，迄二十日午，守軍僅以兩個團的兵力，與匪二·四·六·七·八·五個　隊約十萬人，反覆衝殺，獲得三倍以上的代價，匪雖然調動在遼南所有的砲兵，以三十門以上的重砲，和五十餘門山砲，集中聶擊，但仍未動搖守軍的士氣，直戰到煉鋼廠內的最後一個據點被　，始偕同着工人們突團東　。</p>
<p>週邊的情勢，匪因南向營口延伸，北向法庫迂迴，西又增防大凌河溝帮子和打虎山，兵力已是左支右細，因此已感到國軍在北寗路上的壓力，日漸增加，如果冰凍全解，海運暢通，匪當然更感　脅，所以急於在短期中亟想把　陽先孤立起來，但自從匪發動進犯以來，已逾三個多月，瀋陽至今仍是堅强如昔，四週據點，除遼南一方以外，仍然是屹立不動，法庫乃是國軍戰略撤退，匪在軍事上不能達到由遼西會　進攻瀋陽的企圖，當然只有用阻斷交通和物資　入的方法，以爲久困之計，在這種持久戰演變的結果，國軍仍不難取得機會，轉爲有利的態勢。</p>
<p>華中方面</p>
<p>華中戰局，大別山戰事已由追甽進入淸剿階段，陳毅匪部主力，正被國軍追奔逐北，逃向魯西，他在城武·曹縣·單縣，並未站穩脚，即被國軍兩面夾擊，原來計劃是想破壞津浦北段，但由於國軍緊追不放，計不得逞，匪除將四·六兩縱隊和兩廣縱隊爲掩　，三縱隊同一·六縱隊之一部，在民權。蘭封之南北，以牽制追兵外，另以八縱隊和十·十一共三個縱隊，越路南竄，企圖重建接濟劉匪之補給綫，一部已到柘城附近，一部還在夏邑附近，正避戰　　南竄中。</p>
<p>綜上所述，關內外戰局動態，東北正在相持，關內國軍正着手軍事政治經濟配合進剿，在戰塲上一城一鎭的得失，或每一地的數得數失，巳不是決定戰爭的因素，這是我們分晰各方面戰局不可不知道的。</p>

<h3>總統接受右翼閣員辭職捷共黨組成新閣社民黨分裂派參加合作</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕倫敦廿五日廣播：捷克京城訊：貝奈斯總統已正式接受戈德華總理所提之內閣名單。又訊據目擊者稱，警察今日向遊行之學生開槍。</p>
<p>〔聯合社捷京廿五日電〕政府電台今午（上海時間約下午七時三十分）宣佈，貝奈斯總統巳俯從共產黨要求，而對反共產閣員十二人辭職一節予以照准。新政府將於今日下午成立，大致當由共產黨控制。</p>
<p>〔合衆社普拉格廿五日電〕共黨總理戈德華今日下午六時偕同若干共然部長進謁貝奈斯總統，提出新閣員名單。各反對黨領袖已承認失敗，然天主敎由主敎貝朗爲首向捷克人民呼籲「恢復理智，不可忘却責任，維持法律」。替代前六黨聯合內閣之戈德華內閣將由共黨若干願與共黨合作之社會民主黨以及少數反對黨之叛黨者組成。貝奈斯於下午八時向全國廣播時，對新閣即可作最後決定。按前此總統所發表之文吿，均謂總統僅能接受基於憲法議會規則之新閣。共黨之公吿稱，新閣乃基於制憲議會之多數者。然共然之政變，似已使社會民主黨分裂，僅一派將參加新閣，此派由左翼費林格所領導，渠曾任捷　駐蘇大使以及戰後第一任總理。該黨領導當局，包括主席勞斯曼與秘書長維里姆致函貝奈斯，聲言決予支持，並謂政治危機中，總統之態度須予尊重。函內稱，黨之執行委員會一致深信，引起危機之分裂，非爲不能克服者，然必須根據國家陣綫（意即各黨內閣）之原則依憲章解決。貝奈斯今晚之演說，將爲政變四日來第一次向全國之公開演說。</p>
<p>〔衆社普拉格廿五日電〕共黨警察今日開始逮捕所謂英美間牒陰謀中之人士。共黨控制下之普拉格電台稱，被捕者乃爲與兩西方國家之領事維持經常關係之人。同時共黨警察與工會之各行動委員會，迅速在全國增强其閃電式取得之權力，工人示威隊正走向總統府。</p>
<p>〔合衆社普拉格廿五日電〕共黨事實上已控制捷克。多難之捷克全境非共產勢力之最後堡壘，祗剩下貝奈斯總統一人。憲法上貝氏爲國家首長，渠須避免與任何黨徒沆　一氣，直接干涉政府之權力亦受有限制。在共黨「不流血政變」之整個過程中，貝氏猶如最高法院，要求公平解決政潮。自上星期五後，年高六十有三之貝氏每日工作十八小時，覓取民主之解決方式。其任期爲七年，於一九五三年始滿期，雖年事已高，渠仍決定完畢任期。</p>
<h3>美重視捷局演變蘇聯今後行動極堪注目</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕紐約廿五日廣播：華盛頓訊，外交界方面預測共產黨控制捷克之後，法國和義大利不久亦將發生由蘇方在幕後鼓動之新困難，衆信莫斯科不久即將對希臘·土耳其·芬蘭與伊朗加强壓力。</p>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓廿五日電〕美國官方對捷克之政變，並不表示驚訝。自去夏蘇聯向捷克致　的美敦書令其改變參加馬歇爾計劃之決定後，國務院即預料蘇聯終將攫取捷克之一切，猶如其對付其他東歐各國然。</p>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓廿四日電〕美國廿四日勉强承認捷克全境之淪人共黨手中爲一旣成事實。在東歐國家中僅捷克尙能開啓向西之一扇小窗，及阻止克材姆營控制其內政。美國今日無從援手，甚至不能致抗議。然預計國務院不久能覓取方法，坦白聲明美國充份明瞭捷共置全國於蘇聯鐵蹄下之非法手段。</p>
<p>〔路透社華盛頓廿四日電〕此間消息靈通之國際經濟專家表示，共黨若在捷克取得政權，該國或將喪失世界銀行對該國貨放之三億五千萬元。捷對外貿易將失正常，國內人活標準亦將下降。</p>
<h3>捷克總統崇仰民主致共黨函發表</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社普拉格廿五日電」捷總統貝奈斯頃致函共黨領袖稱，「君等知予對民主政治有誠實信仰，予目前不能將之放棄，因予認爲民主政治係達到崇高誠實人類生活唯一之健全永久基礎。予認爲民主政治如無議會自由及一議會政府，即不能存在。予完全了解在民主政治範圍以內，有社會經濟改革之必要。予過去之一生政治生活，係受此種原則指導，予如違背此種原則，予即將對自身之信仰以及對信託予之不忠實。吾人今日之民族危機，祗能以民主及議會手段加以克服，此並非予欲不顧共黨要求之意，予認爲一切政黨應共同負政治責任」。</p>
<h3>捷封鎖鄰德邊境武裝保安警雲集</h3>
<p>〔聯合社弗朗克福廿五日電〕美佔領軍司令部今日宣稱：捷克保安警察携帶槍械與手槍，已完全控制其西部邊境，並加以嚴密封鎖。依照通常情形，亞希一地僅駐警察三十名，現有至少三百名，邊境火車職工亦均武裝。</p>
<h3>蘇秘密工作人員滲入夏威夷</h3>
<p>陰謀發動第二珠港事變</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕紐約廿五日廣播：曼薩居賽次州昆西城訊，曼州副州長柯立芝稱，蘇聯秘密工作人員不斷滲入夏威夷，以謀對珍珠港發動新襲擊，其兇猛程度，與日本人在一九四一年所作之偸襲，將不相上下。夏威夾州長史丹勃克已獲得種種之證據，其中包括共黨發給秘密工作人員之訓令在內。</p>
<h3>紀念珍珠港戰役美興建公墓</h3>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓廿五日電〕美衆院撥款委會今日通過以一百餘萬元興建紀念公墓，俾美國有史以來　大之軍事慘敗珍珠港附近，能有一紀念建築。公墓將由陸軍興工建造，地在夏威夷「犧牲嶺」上，該山俯瞰珍珠港。</p>
<h3>安理會繼續辯論聖地分治案</h3>
<p>聯大計劃有修改可能</p>
<p>〔路透社成功湖廿五日電〕安理會定於今日標準時間下午八時恢復巴勒斯坦問題之辯論，甚至巴勒斯坦問題專家亦均不能預料辯論將有如何之結果，美國昨在安理會中避免就巴勒斯坦問題採取堅決之立塲不啻向安理會其他理事國暗示，美國在現階段中尙不願供給軍隊，以供執行分治計劃。此項解釋如果屬實，則將於今日發言之中國及阿根廷代表將再度抨擊分治計劃。哥倫比亞於昨日之辯論中臨時提出之決議案，實際上已計及聯大分治計劃之修改。</p>
<h3>荷比盧參加倫敦會議協商對西德政策法堅決反對德中央集權</h3>
<p>〔路透社倫敦廿四日電〕法大使館發言人稱：英美法三國就德國問題之討論，繼續在倫敦舉行，未曾成立任何決議。渠不願透露其他情報，會後亦未發表公報。荷比盧三國代表團可望於廿五日出席會議，參與議程第一項之討論。</p>
<p>〔路透社巴黎廿五日電〕此間人士相信參加倫敦三强會議之法代表團，將就戰爭結束以來每一法國政府所堅持的管制德國之方式，提出新的辯解。惟能否因此使三强意見趨於一致，則尙待事實證明。法國所堅特者爲以本身安全爲根據，因此法國要求盟國對魯爾區實施有效管制，同時亦因此而堅決反對德國或西德有一集櫂的中央政府。皮杜爾外長之顧問透露，法國對德政策之正式立塲將如下述：法國認爲除非西歐國家眞正能有政治及經濟的團結，歐洲殊不能復興，而此項團結必須要有西德之參加。但若西德爲一高度中央集權的政府，則歐洲集團不免受德國之操縱。</p>
<h3>北歐四國設立經濟委員會研討合作辦法</h3>
<p>〔路透社奧斯陸廿四日電〕挪威瑞典丹麥冰島四國外長，於結束彼等在此間之會議後發表公報，聲明四國業已決定參加馬歇爾方案，及促進歐洲十六國經濟合作之工作委員會。四國政府並認馬歇爾方案之成功，對於　歐洲復興具有決定性的重要。四國政府對於馬歇爾方案所擬解決的問題，意見完全一致。公報復宣布，北歐四國已決定即時成立經濟合作委員會，以考慮：（一）統一北歐四國關稅，以謀建立關稅同盟；（二）减低北歐四國相互間之關稅，及對貿易數量之限制；（三）擴大四國間工商業勞工之分配及技術之促進，並謀促進新工業之產生，以究成四國間之相互經濟；（四）延長現行的四國商業合作制度。</p>
<h3>蔣廷在小型大會宣佈我深盼韓蘇合作　南北韓分裂行動應避免</h3>
<p>〔路透社成功湖廿四日電〕中國代表蔣廷戰今日在聯合國小型大會中籲請聯合國朝鮮委員會，切不可有足以加强南北韓分裂的行動。並日：中國政府極盼朝鮮能對蘇聯發展　友好的關係。美代表傑索普表示美國贊成即時在南韓舉行選舉，以建立國民政府。蔣廷　之言有云：聯合國朝鮮委員會應避免足以使南北韓分裂更形具體化之行動，吾人審査任何行動之際，務必格外審愼，余認聯大決議案所規定之途徑，最有助於促成朝鮮之獨立及統一。中國政府決不　朝鮮之國民政府採取反蘇政策，反之，中國深盼朝鮮能發展對蘇最友好的關係。</p>
<p>〔合衆社成功湖廿四日電〕朝鮮問題辯論至下午繼續進行，未有何決議，小型大會即行休會，至廿五日晨重開。</p>
<h3>蘇緬樹立外交關係</h3>
<p>〔聯合社仰光廿五日電〕緬甸政府今日宣佈與蘇聯樹立外交關係，兩國即將在仰光及莫斯科互設大使館。</p>
<h3>華萊士抨撃馬歇爾計劃</h3>
<p>認爲最後將引起戰爭</p>
<p>〔路透社華盛頓廿四日電〕華萊士在衆院外委會前發表其對馬歇爾歐洲復興方案之抨擊後，出答記者之詢問時復稱；馬歇爾方案將完成歐洲的分裂，最後卒至引起戰爭。</p>
<h3>法總理許曼再獲國會信任</h3>
<p>惟可能引起全國罷工</p>
<p>〔路透社巴黎廿四日電〕國民議會以二九一對二六八票，通過支持政府拒　　　所收四五千法郞大鈔之案，因而給予許曼總理以第六次信任　後，共黨操縱之全國總工會即宣布即將提出普遍增加工資，較十二月日前水準提高百分之五十之要求，總工會主張工資標準應以最低度每月一萬二千法郞爲基礎，不應爲現行之一萬法郞。宣言並曰政府旣不願　諾言，工人今後當　本身之組織及團結以達到其合法要求之滿足。一般僉認總工會此一宣言，不啻對政府財政改革計劃（包括工資之凍結）宣戰，預料在三四星期內，將再發生全國性的罷工運動。</p>
<h3>羅議會解散下月舉行普選</h3>
<p>〔聯合社羅京廿四日電〕羅馬尼亞國會今日表決自動解散，定三月廿六日選舉制　議會，草擬新憲法。</p>
<h3>南京大屠殺松井應負罪責</h3>

<h3>赫爾回憶錄</h3>
<p>— 北美報業聯合會版權所有　本報編譯室</p>
<p>在克列姆林閒談種麥結筏</p>
<p>十月十八日晚上，三國外長在克列姆林宮會晤，具有每一種誠懇合作的徴象，而能切實行事。我們迅即同意幾點，例如：不發表演說，參與我們開會的顧問人選，會議地點以及應該發表的第一次公報。</p>
<p>當我回到大使館的時候，我看到一個從國務院發來的電報，講到邱吉爾先生於十月十二日發給總統的一個電訊，其中建議三國首長就處罰曾犯暴行的德國人，發表一個聯合公報。電報中說總統希望我考慮這個聲明的措詞，以便在莫斯科會議結束時發表。</p>
<p>其中還建議一點，就是除了不影響我們對已往的犯罪者可能採取的行動外，對於現在和將來的暴行應該特別提出警吿。這一點，是在防止迫使德國的犯罪者趨於極端，而在無路可走的時候，處殺無辜的犧牲者。</p>
<p>在預定於十九日下午舉行的第一次正式會議之前，艾登和莫洛托夫都個別地到史柏沙大厦（美國大使館）來訪間我。</p>
<p>和艾登偕來的英大使寇爾爵士（後來他成爲英國駐華盛頓大使）提出了蘇聯方面的願望，就是希望討論軍事問題，特別是有關第二戰綫的問題。我表示我將說明美國的決心，此即執行戰爭直至結束並予它的盟國以充份援助。我們同意我們應該就我們的計劃，我們所以作此項決定的理由以及所獲得的結果，給予蘇聯充份的消息，並且接受它希望提出的任何建議，但是有一點應該表明，就是軍事談判不能在會議中進行。</p>
<p>我向莫洛托夫提出的第一個間題，就是蘇聯的檢査制度。美國的時派員不准發表有關美國代表團抵達莫斯科這種富有人情意味的消息。我問他有關會議一般情形而並不涉及官方工作的消息，是否不准發表。莫洛托夫高聲說檢査員「愚蠢』，並且說他將注意及此。</p>
<p>剛在我們去開會之前（十二月二十三日，莫洛托夫說他已與史達林討論過總統送來的有關德方暴行的建議中的宣言。史達林在稍作修改之後，已表示同意了。</p>
<p>在會議中討論到暴行的時候，蘇方採取堅强的立塲。他們在德國人手中受苦極深，他們希望對應負集體屠殺蘇聯公民責任的德國官吏，作嚴厲迅速的法律制裁。</p>
<p>艾登辯護說一切法律形式都應該注意到。</p>
<p>當輪到我發表意見時，我就說：</p>
<p>假如照我的辦法做，我將把希特勒和墨索里尼和東條和他們的主要共謀者拿來，並且帶他們到戰地臨時軍法會議。在翌日旭日初升的時候，一椿歷史性的事情就將發生。」</p>
<p>當這幾句話被譯出的時候，莫洛托夫和他的全體代表團高聲歡呼，表示贊成，會議的平寗暫時被破壞。</p>
<p>我在莫斯科時，關於此一問題心中所想到的主要之點，就是對於因强有力的獨裁者以其征服與奴役全世界的計劃以及野蠻的方法造成的情形，全世界應以激烈方式對付。我覺得世界上這一類亡命之徒應該直截痛快地加以對付，猶如他們直截痛快地對付世界上的無辜人民一樣。</p>
<p>我假定當我們捉到了三個軸心國的首畏和它們的魁首的時候，我們也可以獲得他們的秘密文件，假如我們依照國際法審判的形式，我們多少要處理一番。但是我不願這種步驟會妨礙我們迅速處置　　匪魁。</p>
<p>我曾向羅斯福總統提出這個見解，並且在邱吉爾首相和艾登訪問莫斯科的時候，也曾向他們提出。我並且在內閣會議中提出了好幾次。我直率地說我認爲德日義這輩煽動戰爭者應該全部予以絞決。</p>
<p>在我任職國務院期間，我的觀念並未肯定地被拒絕。但在我辭去國務卿之職以後，變成贊成正式審判了。</p>
<p>但是我不願意被認爲是反對紐侖堡審判的。當後來決定這樣辦時，我衷心予以支持。我的意見，祗不過是關於不同的審判方式而已。</p>
<p>在我到莫斯科將近一星期之後，我對莫洛托夫說我不知道怎樣議定覲見史達林元帥的步驟；我不知道必須等待多久或者我是否已經等待得太久了；但是假如我能够看見他的「上司」，無論如何我認爲是一種光榮。我把這樁事情讓莫洛托夫去辦理。</p>
<p>艾登到莫斯科不久之後就見過史達林，但是他爲了覲見事前就接洽好的。我並沒有接洽過。我的理論是我應該和莫洛托夫辦理事務，不要讓他以爲我想越過了他，和史達林去接觸。</p>
<p>莫洛托夫極快地通知我說，史達林將在十月二十五日下午三時在克列姆林宮接見我。</p>
<p>我知道我們談話的主要題目之一，乃是關於羅斯福，史達林和邱士　爾建議中的會議。在我抵達莫斯科之前和之後，總統一直就會議的問題在和史達林互通電報。在原則上，已經是同意舉行會議了，但是關於會議的地點，却出現了不可克服的障礙。</p>
<p>在十月十四日的電報中，總統建議伊拉克首都彼格達，或東非刻田英軍佔領的義屬伊里德里亞首都阿斯瑪拉，或者土耳其首都安卡拉。史達林已經建議過德黑蘭。總統建議十一月二十日或二十五日爲會議日期。</p>
<p>十月十七日，史達林回答說，他不能接受總統所建議的任何地方以代替德黑蘭。他說這不是保護的問題，關於這一點他無所顧慮，而是在蘇軍當前的攻勢作戰中和它保持密切接觸的問題。他說他的同僚認爲這些作戰行動需要他和最高指揮部保持個人的接觸。在德黑蘭，這種接觸是可以保證的，因爲那裏有電報電話直通莫斯科。</p>
<p>總統於十月二十一日發給我一個畏的電報，聲稱他在審愼估計時間因素以及他自己在憲法上的責任之後，認爲德黑蘭對他是不可能的。他的意思是說他不能到一個如此孤立的地方，致使他不能從國會接獲法案，並在十天之內送回。由於高山之故，德黑蘭是飛機離以接近的地方，在飛入城飛出之前，可能要等待好幾天。</p>
<p>總統說史達林在答覆總統的幾個電報中，對於羅斯福先生所受的約束並不表示理解。所以他要我把一個電文交給史達林，並且向他口頭說明他不想到德黑蘭去的肯定和明白的理由，這不是爲了個人的好惡而是爲憲法所規定的。</p>
<p>所以他建議伊拉古的巴斯拉以爲代　。史達林可以從　黑蘭通一根特別電話綫到巴斯拉，由蘇聯人管理，如此，他還是可以和英斯科保持直接接觸的。</p>
<p>總統力言他願意從美國到離開蘇聯領土六百英里以內的任何地方。他必須保持一個業已成立一百五十年以上的憲政政府而恪守其規定。假如不是爲此，他願意跑十倍的路來會晤史達林。他結語說，假如爲了幾百英里路而使史達林，邱吉爾和他自己不能會晤，未來的子子孫孫將認爲是一幕悲劇。</p>
<p>十月二十五日下午，當我在克列姆林宮坐在一只土色的合子旁邊面對着史達林的時候，我就向他把所有各點加以說明。哈里曼大使與鮑侖（Charles　E．Bohlen）和我在一起，而莫洛托夫和一位譯員則坐在史達林的兩側。</p>
<p>當我走進大元帥的大辦公室時，他從另一個門裏進來，在一半路的地方和我碰頭並且握手。他極誠摯而可親。他招引我到台子旁邊的我的座位去，於是坐在我的對面，背向着墻</p>
<p>我們的談話以私人的閒談開始。我們就如何種麥的問題交換意見。我吿訴史達林在田納西麥要種得六英寸深，這對他似乎是新奇的。我們討論造木筏的方法。我描述在田納西地方我們怎樣用胡桃籐把木頭連結起來。史達林則描述他的人民怎樣用葡萄籐結筏。</p>
<p>我吿訴史達林我到莫斯科來的欣喜情緒，多年來希望訪問他的國家這個願望，終得如願以償。</p>
<p>我說在我的一生中曾出席過許多國際會議，但是在所有的國際會議中，我沒有受到過更周到的招待，傑我們從我們的主人蘇聯政府，尤其是莫洛托夫那裏受到的。史達林回答說他想不到會有這樣的批評。</p>
<p>我指出現行會議的最重要任務之一，就是要爲他自己，羅斯福總統和邱吉爾的會晤，奠定一個基礎，對於這次會晤，所有我國人民，事實上世界上所有人民，凡從事反抗納粹主義和法西斯主義的戰鬥中，都表示最大的　　，於是我把　統有關會晤地點的這個電報，面呈給史達林。</p>
<p>史達林在讀過俄文的譯文之後，就把它交給莫洛托夫，聲言必須加以考慮，並且和他的同僚商量。莫洛托夫外長在閱覽之後說，重要的軍事行動當時正在進行之中，蘇聯政府的所有高級軍政常局都一致認爲史達林絕對不能離開，但是在不得不如此時，至多也祗能到每天可以維持直接通訊的地方</p>
<p>於是史達林就建議最好把會晤延期到下一年的春季，那時候，阿拉斯的凡朋克斯將是一個適當的所在。</p>
<p>我說總統和我都深深地感到國際的局勢需要這一次會議，如不能及時舉行，將在所有的盟國人民中引起深刻的失望，因爲它的影響，將能團結我們三個國家，加緊合作，以謀執行戰爭，並在戰後時間實行合作。</p>
<p>史達林揷進來說，他在原則上並不反對這次會晤。</p>
<p>我回答說，我理解他正在想的，僅僅是關於我們正在討論的切實辦法。</p>
<p>他力言在他這方面並無同執已見或者威信的問題，但是他不能理解爲什麽國家的文書躭擱一兩夭應該如此被重視，而軍事行動上的偶一失着却不是一個文法的錯誤過後可以校正的，而須付出千禽人生命的代價。在他這方面講，在巴斯拉會晤的困難，完全是關於物質的佈置方面的，特別是通訊方面。</p>
<p>史達林說，他對於保護的問題，一些也沒有什麽顧慮。他提出這一點，是在哈里曼大使三國首長可以居住在巴斯拉山後自己的營帳中，由自己的軍隊保衛，因此可以保證完全的隔離和保護之後。</p>
<p>在我們的談話繼續一小時——實際上是半小時，因爲需要翻譯的時間——由於會議的時刻已近，我就對史達林說，因爲我是莫洛托夫的學生，現在該是上課堂去的時間了。大元帥對我微笑，希望我們有好的運氣。</p>
<p>當討論結束之後，他立起身，繞過台子，和我握手，並且說了些用俄文說的話。他的譯員還坐在台子上結束他的摘記，史達林的說話於是消失在稀薄的空氣之中。大元帥回轉頭來對着譯員，並且很銳利地對他說，一個譯員的責任就是一直要在他的旁邊（鮑侖後來這樣吿訴我的）。繼而我得知史達林對於能够看到我，曾表示極大的欣喜。</p>

<h3>參議大會緊急動議　促請政府穩定物價　成立特別委會今晨審查</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕昨日為參議會五次大會之第三日，下午舉行第三次會議，除由衛生，工務，公用三局長報告施政，參議員質詢教育，衛生，工務局長，以及敎育，衛生二局長答覆外，並通過緊要提案兩件，臨時動踐一件，及討論臨時緊急動議一件，該臨時緊急動議案係王先青等十八人提出，「爲減除民生疾苦，採取有效辦法，根本穩定物價，以安民心案。」其原列辦法如下：「（一）關於外匯分配及屬於中央之公用及交通事業之貼補，急速電請中央辦理。（二）屬於地方性之公用及交通事業，請市府迅速執行。（三）目前物價逐日昇騰，此項辦法應請中央及本市政府於最短期內予以急速處置。」後因該案事關重大，須從長討論，經大會決議：（一）本案組織特別審査委員會審査，審査會定二月廿六日上午十時在本會二樓會議室舉行會議。（二）審査會由議長副議長爲召集集人。（三）審査會委員名單授權議長擬定，原提案人及連署人均應出席審査會。經擬定名單：為潘公展，王先青，徐寄　，處舜，董幹文，葛傑臣，李文杰，嚴諤聲，周祥生，勞敬　，趙棣華，水祥雲，許寳驊，郭琳爽，王宗灝，周學湘，黄炳權，江浩然，奚玉書，周斐成，陶百川，馮有眞，陳保泰，高君汀，王延松，陸炳堃，詹文滸，楊公庶，曹俊，鄭壽芝，崔冲漢，劉靖基，何品衡，焬撫生，邵永生，王乃徐。（四）未經推定爲審査會委員之各參議員亦請自由列席。（五）審査會開會時請上海市市長，社會局長，公用局長，警察局長，財政局長，上海市政府會計長，花紗布管制委員會主任委員，民食調配委員會副主任委員，及上海金融管理局局長均列席。（六）提五字第二十五號提案併入本案審査。</p>
<h3>籲請國府增強東北實力</h3>
<p>其餘緊要提案爲（一）周濂澤等提「籲請國民政府增强東北實力，收復失地，安定局勢。」決議，照案通過。（二）「擬請市府令民政局轉飭各區保甲調査本市各區房租實况’藉以審定房租標準，以安民居。」辦法，調査三十六年十二及三十七年一月份房租並與民二十六年比較。決議：請區保甲長即於日內辦竣，並登報吿衆。臨時動議一起，爲挽留張維局長案。</p>
<h3>經費短絀改進困難　張維表示求去心切　臨時動議一致挽留</h3>
<p>衛生局張局長報吿工作，對於防疫設施，環境衛生，保健業務，藥醫管理等均分類說明，但因經費缺少，雖竭力改進，終未能達到理想，以糞車一項而論，需要新車五百輛，現已有二百輛，仍少三百輛，故雖破漏之車，仍不得不繼續利用。以言人事，去年本局各單位人負，全部二千餘人，因待遇太低，迄今有五百餘人離職，挽留無效，蓋醫務人員等，如在其他機關服務，其待遇當高出公務人員五倍之多。現局方已發動操守修養訓練，勉勵同人勉强支持，已見相當進步。上屆參議會決議案件十二件，有四件未辦，如普陀區尙未設置平民醫院，引翔醫院猶未接收等是，然此非不辦實係尙未辦妥，此後仍將繼續辦理。</p>
<p>衛生局的罪過　都由個人負責</p>
<p>最後，張局長表示求去之意，言詞懇切，謂，本人說話簡單，人也簡單，一家吃飯可以應付，但屬下數千家吃飯問題無法解決，本人實在無能，想做好而不得。二年來，承各位指敎甚多，慰勉有加，感激不盡。此次恐係最後一次出席大會，對於局內各單位九千餘職工，若說一個壞人也沒有，實在做不到，但最近風氣已改進不少，也是各位功勞。二十一個月來，關於衛生局所有罪過，都我個人責任，要請大家原諒。</p>
<p>參議員吳正矱等七十人，聞張局長言，均甚感動，特在散會前提出臨時動議：「衛生局張局長，爲全國有名之公共衛生專家，其工作努力，建議市長予以挽留，勿任高蹈」經大會一致通過。</p>
<p>倒糞時間收費　何以不加規定</p>
<p>對於衛生局質詢，陳培德提出，糞夫倒糞，何以時間不加規定，收費任意漲價，紛擾市民。又有糞夫將糞便倒入陰溝內，有碍衛生，均應取締。張中原問，電台上公開出售成藥，有否經當局檢騐，何不取締？瞿鉞請注意郊區衛生，並請與警察局會商，准許娛樂塲所附近之小飲食店，延長營業時間。</p>
<p>醫院人員疏忽　應該特別注意</p>
<p>賈德超提出報吿，謂公濟醫院辦事人員非常傲慢，而且疏忽。前有友人足部被輾受傷，向該院求治，當時傷勢並不嚴重，看護即草率從事，說祗要住幾天就好了，但數天後骨內忽然發炎，醫生即將其割斷，詎又因手術草率，不久又病，割之再割，共割了三次之多，此種將好好一個人變成殘廢，實在殘酷，衛生當局應特別注意。又衛生局對於無主棺材不予焚燒，反將有主棺材燒去，實有刑事罪嫌，且聞有主棺材家屬交出一些錢後，即不予燒去，未知局長知情否？</p>
<p>馬路堆積垃圾　竟達二丈之遙</p>
<p>姜豪謂本人住所門前，馬路上堆積垃圾，達二丈之遙，每日見之厭惡異常，歷數月未除，正擬在本屆大會時提出，詎在開會前一日，垃圾忽然不見，豈有如此巧合？垃圾經費究係一月發一次，抑三月號一次？包商責任，原在淸除垃圾，今若將其傾入河中，豈非與疏濬河道矛盾？陸惠民詢問防疫種痘準備情形。並請注意里弄垃圾。靑年黨參議員王宗灝稱：（一）本市公共淸潔衛生與過去租界時代所辦，相差甚遠。（二）强迫防疫工作不够澈底。周濂澤謂：小菜塲內空位，尙有一半，但門口擁擠異常，衛生局旣派有監督人員，爲何不與警察聯繫，加以取締？</p>
<p>查出違章糞夫　立即予以開除</p>
<p>張局長對各項質詢一一答覆謂：（一）淸除糞便時間向有規定，冬天在九時以後，夏天在八時以後，馬路上如見到糞車，警察即可抓去。後因冬防時期，有人冒充糞夫，進入市民住所搶刦，故不便過早，且因車輛不够，有拉數次者，致時間延長，但現仍督促警察隨時注意。收費均有規定，如査出違章，即予開除，同時要求市民切勿多給費用。糞便倒入陰溝，除有八個指定地點，直通糞便廠外，此外如有偸懶糞夫，任意倒入陰溝者，惟一辦法，即將其開除。</p>
<p>郊區清潔衛生　決不有所歧視</p>
<p>（二）電台呌賣及報章登載藥品有管理法規辦理，但管理電台較管理報館困難得多，以後一定嚴格辦理。（三）對於郊區淸潔，決不歧視，衛生局對戶外戶內淸潔，向來重視，並積極促進市民注意。（四）醫院人員醫德。希望大家重視，不論公私立醫院，衛生局，均應加以注意。（五）有主浮厝給錢小工，曾在洋涇區發現，已予開除。</p>
<p>垃圾久積不清　自當予以嚴辦</p>
<p>（六）垃圾出淸遲延，因船隻出口困難，如發現久積不淸者，請報吿本局，即當將該淸道夫嚴辦。（七）公共衛生不及戰前完善，確是事實，但如有戰前條件，不一定會比戰前辦得壞。按照戰前人數，現在辦事人員應有七千多，但目前局內局外，總共祗有五千人。（八）辦理防疫，第一年不願操之過急，本年即將加强，三月一日開始種痘，去年種痘人數乃打破以往任何一年紀錄。（九）其他如小菜塲等情形，決縱續努力改進但現已較前進步。</p>
<h3>怪胎　多生兩手兩足</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕本月二十三日京滬綫南翔鎭財神廟南陳家宅有鄕民甘歧淸之妻甘吉氏懷孕足月，產下一怪胎，除頭部與常人無異外，全身共有四手四足及兩生殖器，均爲男性（見圖）。甘氏此嬰已爲第二胎，產下後因見其怪異，認爲大不吉利，遂任其凍斃。現該死嬰已由南翔西市惠民夫婦醫院收存，以供醫藥上之研究。</p>
<h3>教局答覆質詢　失學兒童正調查中　擬給晚上讀書機會</h3>
<p>各參議員繼前日向敎育局提出質詢，張一渠首先問，老閘區至今猶未設一國民學校，何故？李局長以找不到地點爲推托，究竟有未找過？，如永遠無地，是否永遠不設？老閘區市民納稅最多，而一校不設，是否以後該區區民納稅可打八折？路式導問楊樹浦何以無國民學校？王維駟問，已檢定合格敎員是否有職業保障？前次大會決議劃撥專款充郊區國民學校修建之用，辦理到何種程度實瞿鉞請將新陸師範趕快成立。賈德超謂，（一）成人識字班應滿五十人設，往往人數不足時即設立，實浪費金錢。（一）失學兒童如此之多，如何補救？張中原報吿新年中咖啡館有小學生來募捐，此項募捐，敎局有未核准。錢頌平說學校設備簡陋，希望在質的方面多加改善。李樹滋稱：（一）新涇江鎭小學無籬笆，學生遊戲走路即在馬路上，車輛來往很危險，而學樣當局非但不能收進修費，連書籍亦要奉送。（二）眞如西庫學校課室連蘆蓆亦沒有。如此情形，證明郊區學校無補助，政府應劃專款。（三）女敎師生產代課金何以發出如此遲緩，每有接到時已將生第二個小孩了。</p>
<p>老閘區建校找不到空地</p>
<p>李局長當即分別答覆，（一）老閘區本年度預算至少有一校可設，公地實在找不到，私地如可將市府其他公地調換，亦願辦理。此次大會後，決請老閘區區長保長參議員等共同籌劃尋覓地點，至經費則可設法請撥。張一渠對李局長答覆仍表不滿，再請吳市長答覆。市長稱，老閘區僅有厦門路公地可建校，但該地有建築物，如强制執行拆遷，市民又將請願。私地無力購買，此問題祗能在與參議員區保長共同會商後再答覆。李局長復答覆質詢稱：（二）楊樹浦中心小學俟體育專校搬至江灣後即準備設立。</p>
<p>將撥二百億助郊區學校</p>
<p>（三）私校整頓隨時在注意中，取締之中小學已有十餘所。檢定敎員乃給與資格，並非一定給與職位。專款撥助郊區學校，業經市政會議通過，將撥二百億。（四）新陸師範校舍，前被不良份子拆除建室，將來要他們賠償，即可修建。（五）失學兒童正在調査中，擬給與晚上讀書機會。公敎人員子弟免費因有若干機關原有學費貸金故不應再給。（六）小學生募捐確有發現，但査出後學校否認。須知現在冒充學生者極多，冒充家長敎師亦有，局方當儘量取締。（七）生產代課金確有遲發，原因爲手續麻煩，此屆一週內即可發出。</p>
<h3>工務局八字苦　業務繁重　經費困難</h3>
<p>工務局長趙祖康報告該局情形，以八字包括，即「業務繁重，經費困難」。至過去工作，在市政建設捐項下第一期九十億修建道路共十四路綫，計五萬餘平方公尺。第二期款未收到，係由市府所撥，二十餘路綫共五萬餘平方公尺，現已完成一半，計二萬七千平方公尺。此一款項希望下半年能加三倍，即收五四〇億，傳以三分之二修建道路，三分之一修橋樑。溝渠方面已在改進，本年膠州路積水決可减少。蘇州河橋樑共有十七座，戰時損壞十一座，現已修竣者七座，其他四座尙未完成。南市碼頭一至九號已完成，十至十二號在準備中，十月後可吿成。蘇州河汚泥須疏濬者有二六〇萬立方碼，擬每月疏五萬立方碼，則三年後可完工，經費二千四百億元已有把握。浚河工作有八十萬立方公尺，去年完成二十四萬，工賑可作二四萬。海塘工程三月底可將高橋海濱浴塲以南十六哩完成，可通行汽車。今後計劃，對都市計劃要特別推進，蘇州河橋樑加緊修建。但感到困難者爲經費，材料及人事各方面。以經常預算而言，即不足甚多，（一）養護費，民卅五年爲六九億，去年三二〇億，今年僅九百億，較之去年與前年比，少二倍。（二）新建費，民卅五年爲九五億，去年五四二億，今年僅三六〇億，反較去年打了六折。而材料費本年較去年漲十五至二十倍。</p>
<h3>質詢多起今日答覆</h3>
<p>參議員質詢者有（一）鍾玉良問，浦東大道何以不築，如經費不够，可先建一部份。（二）張學濂謂龍華馬路破洞以爛泥塡覆，可否改善。（三）邵永生稱，歸化路像泥路，晴天亦須穿套鞋。（四）善明問龍華南北幹路何時開始興築？蒲匯塘工賑開工至今一個半月尙未完成十分之二，如此遲緩，將影響春耕。（五）張志韓詢浦東私地被徵築路，何以不還地價，居民擬破壞該路，當局應注意。（六）姜懷素稱，福州路平望街附近路面極窄，房屋突出，何以不拆？　趙局長以昨日時間不及，將於今日答覆。</p>
<h3>今日議程</h3>
<p>今日下午第四次會議，議程如次：工務局長答覆質詢。公用局質詢及答覆。民政·警政·社會等局工作報吿。各區區長代表及區民代表會代表報吿。如時間充裕，並將對民政·警政·社會等局提質詢與答覆。</p>
<h3>飛機抬高運費案　偵訊兩公司人員　據供空運價目本無一定</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕中國。中央兩航空公司北平辦事處，被控擅自抬高運費一案，昨日地檢處開庭訊問，上午檢察官傳訊中國航空公司貨郵科長蔣能祥，代理營業主任劉安平，北平辦事處長徐鑫，結果諭知各交書面保五億元。下午檢察官傳訊中央航空公司副總經理査鎭湖，營運組主任鄧誥章，査鄧均係應訊人，結果飭回。據聞昨日偵訊內容，爲（一）是否擅自抬高運價，（二）和記，華懋兩家運輸公司字號是否虛設，被告曁應訊人稱：空運價目本無一定，依照習慣係根據成本而定遝價，至於北平至太原間運費較高原因，因商人常包用平幷間往返飛機，其運費即以往返計算，雖係空機飛回，亦須認運費，外界不明眞相，致引起誤會。檢察官當即諭知中央航空公司將交通部關於規定運費之命令呈送地檢處參考，該案被吿中以中國航空公司北平辦事處長徐鑫嫌疑較重，今日上午繼續開庭偵訊，中央航空公司北平辦事處長則因病未到。</p>
<p>吳市長，吳局長（右起第二第三人）訪問難童（本報攝）</p>
<h3>第三庇寒所難民至今還是吃不飽　吳市長昨偕參議員視察　一齊跪下哀求</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕本市軍工路第三庇寒所，開辦迄今，已有二個月，但以辦理未盡善，潘議長夫婦上次親往視察時，難民多呼「吃不飽」，且跪地哀求，狀甚悽慘。各報對之亦頗多指摘。吳市長甚爲關懷，特於昨晨會同社會局長吳開先，參議員邵永生，姚抱眞，童廉，黄振生等前往視察。</p>
<p>昨日天氣晴朗，吳市長等一行前往時，難民正環聚室外曬太陽，難民總數七百餘人，分成兒童組，男子組，及婦女組等，市長到達時，均起立致敬，兒童組几齋聲一拍手歡呼「中華民國萬歲』，顯係事前曾受訓練。吳市長除參觀第三庇寒所外，並赴江灣參觀工賑庇寒所，對浚河工賑難民表示滿意。</p>
<p>記者昨爲第二次參觀第三庇寒所，覺得設備方面，確有顯著改進，譬如從前難民喝生水，昨天已有熱水供應，從前難民衣衫褫　，臥房臭氣四溢，昨天一律穿着灰棉襪褲，臥房亦經消毒，且各人頸項間各　雪白毛巾，一個難童特地吿訴記者：這毛巾是潘議長夫人送贈的。</p>
<p>記者昨天比吳市長早到了一個鐘頭，據某難婦偸偸吿訴記者：「我們仍舊吃不飽，每天二頓飯，每頓只准吃一碗多一點，但是我們都不敢說，誰說了誰就會挨打……」。這時正見所中辦事員走來，難婦談話立即停止。記者希望能明瞭眞相，想找幾個難民談談，但因辦事員隨時同在，難民都不敢說話。一等辦事員離去，難民便爭相吿訴。據說二頓飯都是半濕半乾，每頓吃不到二碗，實在肚子餓，誰向外人吿訴「吃不飽」，就要吃「生活」，所以吳市長來了，我們也不敢說實話。</p>
<p>吳市長昨參觀婦女組及兒童組時，婦女及兒童都沒有表示，但當行經男子組時，難民中竟有人高呼「跪下來，向吳市長吿狀」，旋即紛紛跪下，搥胸拭淚，痛哭流涕，齊喊「吃不飽」。而吳市長周圍之辦事員則表示：「每天二頓乾飯，每人二碗，應該可以吃飽，只要在難民的臉色上就可以看得出來」。致吳市長一時無法應付。</p>
<p>據該所主任表示，難民伙食規定每人每月食米二斗，蔬菜費每日每人二千元，事實上的確不够。據說今日起，可望略爲增加，則今後難民管理方面，或可望更多改携矣。</p>
<h3>下月十日前可實行配米</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕本市民食調配會擴大組識事，待中央正式公事於日內到達後，即實行改組，由任顯羣出任主委。任氏昨日午後在私邸邀集有關方面商討本市全面配米技術問題，研究配米手續。據稱：配米日期擬予提早，配購證正趕印中，三月十日彰市民即可憑證配購一斗。配米價格，據社會局吳局長稱：係依照上月份最後五天市塲平均價格九五折計算。</p>
<h3>十期計口授糖　三月廿日可望配出</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕上海市物價評議會食糖小組，昨日上午在社會局舉行第二十二次評議會，主席顧炳元，決議事項如下：本年舉辦計口授糖六期，每二個月舉辦一期，第十期計口授糖依一月份人口配售，第十一期依三月份人口配售，依此類推。每期每人仍配一斤，第十期計口授糖配價依照一月份一萬三千五百元配價六折計算，每斤八千元，加區保甲川旅及糖證印刷等費用後，零售每斤一萬二千元，於三月二十日左右配出。</p>
<h3>怡和啤酒廠長　德人被盜毆斃　廚司涉嫌已被扣留</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕滬東定海路三五〇號怡和啤泗廠長兼工程師雷納，德國人，六十一歲，在該廠服務已十三年。其要安娜雷納，五十七歲，同居廠內四樓。前晚十時餘，安娜已入睡，雷納正在房內打字，致函其女。不料有悍匪五入，三人用布蒙面，由後面荒塲　登上樓，打開四樓房門，出槍恫嚇，並用手銬將雷納反銬，綁於扶梯欄杆上，其妻安娜亦彼拖起，逼令交出金條飾物，雷納不允，當被匪痛毆，其妻乃忍痛開啓保險箱，當被刧去黄金六十兩，大小鑽戒七隻，美鈔一千七百五十元，估計損失在十億元以上，携贓而逸。惟雷納卒因傷風倒地，未幾殞命，安娜素患神經衰弱症，亦昏厥不起，直至午夜十二時餘，始蘇醒投報楊樹浦警分局，該局立派幹警査勘。聞一廚司涉嫌被扣，至在逃之匪犯，正在追緝中。</p>
<h3>國際性黑市金鈔案　審問中外十四被告　筆録未簽字　廖銓祺翻供　葉晉元等兩人亦準交保</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕叙利亞人麥克多等經營黑市金鈔一案，昨晨地院開庭審訊，到被告麥克多，廖銓祺，薛聯煌，葉晋元，葉德發，馬維衡，黄馥涵，鄭嘉裕，林尙楨，鍾金定，陳棟樑，楊季潛，唐金水，馬太利亞（女）等十四名。該案嫌疑較重者麥克多，廖銓祺，昨日朱育璜庭長訊問時間較長，據麥克多供稱：與廖銓祺相識一年，過去係做股票，未做過金鈔買賣，麥克多洋行係我獨資經營，金條從我身上抄出，是做押款之甩，未做投機。廖銓祺供稱：抄出十七根金條是我本人的，當時在警局供稱條子是馬相林所有，係經十四人同意均如此說法。渠在警局供詞均予否認，謂筆錄上未簽字，企圖根本翻供。馬太利亞身上搜出美鈔二百六十三元二角五分，渠亦否認買賣，在押被吿葉晋元，葉德發承認曾送兩次金條與廖銓祺，第一次一條，第二次四條半，其餘各被吿均否認有經營黑市金鈔情形，末庭諭在押之葉晋元，葉德發各交五億元書面保，其餘均交原保，改期再訊。</p>
<h3>日戰犯一批判罪　明日審中野久勇</h3>
<p>日戰犯前崇明憲兵隊特高科科長中野久勇，越獄拘獲後，國防部軍事法庭定廿七日開庭，重新審訊，當庭即予宣判。又該法庭昨宣判：（一）日戰犯前第廿軍第六十八師團步兵第五十七旅小將旅團長黑瀨平一無期徒刑。（二）前華中憲兵少將司令四方諒二無罪。（三）憲兵少校前金華憲兵分隊長南健滕吉，有期徒刑十五年。（四）憲兵軍曹野口五郞，徒刑十五年。（五）憲兵軍曹大西正重，深井盾雄，持田梅太郞，無罪。（六）日兵森田豐造無罪。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕丁錫山殘部「江南人民解放軍副司令」湯景延等七人，連日由警備司令部軍法處派員審訊，日內即可審結。今日上午十時中央電影攝影廠將赴警備部拍攝影片，以完成關於該匪等竄擾·圍剿·捕獲，以至審詢之全套記錄。</p>
<h3>七寶元宵紛擾　工人鄉民互毆</h3>
<p>七寳鎭疏浚蒲匯塘工人三百餘，前晚九時許，在七號橋塘灣村因强提雞鴨與鄕民大起衝突，爲首滋事之工頭工人卅名，後經拘解龍華警局。受傷鄕民馬補祥，馬琴餘，車送市立第八醫院。</p>
<h3>趙曾珏表示消極　自謂係末次見面</h3>
<p>公用局長趙曾珏工作報吿，略謂對自來水廠，正進行工程，目前有自流井及大蓄水庫供水。卡車輪渡每日過江車計六十輛。郊區電話已在南翔。大塲等八處設置，尙有北橋等三鎭未裝，已與電訊局商量趕辦。關於電力方面，成立聯合電力公司乃治本計劃，治標則責成電力公司增加發電量，同時紗廠有機器者應自行發電。上海電力公司原應有一六萬旺之發電機到來，但因美國鑒於歐洲需要更急，故先給歐洲。華商電廠有行總擬二千瓩機三架亦因運輸不便，尚未運到，至於節約用電實屬需要，舉事實而言，前次天寒最甚時，住戶因用電爐，一天之中，多用去電力一萬九千瓩，致紗廠皆停。平時節約後，每日可省七千瓩，若不節約則每日將减少工業用電二萬六千瓩，佔全部百分之二十二，可影響十三萬工人失業。調整公用事業價格，本人亦爲市民担憂，但又須顧到公司方面維持不下之情形。</p>
<p>趙局長最後表示做不下去，謂曾向市長請辭，經市長一再挽留。但最近物價高漲，對市民又交代不過，故再請辭職，這次亦是最後一次與諸位見面了。</p>

<h3>山東春荒嚴重</h3>
<p>〔本報濟南廿二日航訊〕該沒有一省的春荒問題會比山東再遼關，就魯言魯，似乎也再沒有今年山東的春荒來得更嚴重。雖然就表面言，在山東一〇七縣三普通市中，政府已控制了四十一縣市，但事實上，無論淪陷區或收復區，在去年，普遍在全省的是旱災和兵災，而在魯南和魯西，更有所謂水災和風災。</p>
<p>據魯建聽長丁基實和本報記者談：在戰前，山東可供耕種的土地爲</p>
<p>一萬萬市畝</p>
<p>但就　西南　湖入縣去年被洪水淹沒的面積言，即達三百萬市畝，佔全省可耕地卅分之一，這個數目字該不能再算小。而在八年抗戰兩年內亂普遍深入於全省的兵災，尤其共匪的破壞，消耗淸算和鬥爭，使整個農村實際上巳瀕於崩潰的慘境。</p>
<p>據魯建廳去年五月調査濟南，歷城，齊河，濮縣，荏平，高唐，淸平，恩縣，滕縣，博興，鄒平，長淸，萊蕪，淄川，臨朐，諸城，安邱，壽光等十八縣市農業物資損失統計的總平均，計人力損失達百分之五十五弱，耕地荒廢達百分之四十一强，役畜損失達百分之七十強，生產家畜損失達百分之六十九强，大農具損失百分之五十一强，小農具損失百分之四十五强。這雖然只是部份的統計資料，但從這裏已不難臆斷山東農村所遭遇的破壞程度</p>
<p>在新收復區或「解放區」旅行過的人，尤其在沂蒙區，沒有一個不感到食住爲其</p>
<p>最大的威脅</p>
<p>原因是在這裏旅行的人，往往數十里不見一人烟，一完屋，田園荒蕪，野草蔓生，即偶或發現一兩個比較完整的屋子，但它的大門都已用磚土封砌，屋內亦　無一人。據說：這種屋子的主人，多因生活無法維持，乃檢起僅有的細軟，將門窗封砌後，把小孩裝上小車，闔家大小，度他的浚無目的的逃荒生活去了！實在的，他們現在旣早已窮得迎紅薯梗子或野草楡樹皮也沒得吃，懦弱些的除了個別自殺，甚至闔家自殺外，比較富有生命力的，亦只有「易子而食，析骸而驟」，或竟步上「逃亡」，「逃荒」的一途了！</p>
<p>魯省府有感於今年</p>
<p>春荒胡嚴重</p>
<p>除已由社會處　　社會部救濟輔導　擬　在魯境各地　立粥廠及招待所的具體方案，以示救念計，同時，並由建廳向水利部呈准續　　邱繡　的工款十八億，（並擬　續請撥六十億，以完成全部工　。）由南陽湖東之師莊經顏村繞濟寗城至馬場湖東之五里營之南運河堤復堤經費五十億，以上皆以工代賑，此外，並由救濟輔導團中撥食糧十五噸在章邱以工代賑，協修繡惠渠，另撥食糧九十噸在濟寗以工代賑協修南運河。估計至今春五月，由章邱船王莊至李家亭段之</p>
<p>繡惠渠完成</p>
<p>後可灌地一萬五千餘畝，如幹渠廿餘公里全部完成後可灌地八九萬畝。南運河復堤工程，如完成後，則原來被水災的運·泗·府三河間及濟寗東西北三方，馬塲湖週圍及洸河兩岸地區至少約八十萬畝原爲水災地區，皆可一變而爲最肥美的良田沃壤。</p>
<p>目下老百姓最大的困難爲二：即一不安定，二窮困，窮到連種籽，肥料，農具，勞力皆付缺如。前者有賴於國軍正規軍的增加及地方武力的重建，後者則魯省府本年內所能配發的農具種籽最多僅敷十五萬畝之用，而目下</p>
<p>最大的希望</p>
<p>只有：（一）請求中央，如河北一樣，將山東亦列入增產省份，增撥農貸。（二）請求中央將美國十二萬五千噸救濟物資配售後撥其款項一部作魯省農　復員之用。（三）請求中央多撥救濟物資，以工代賑。</p>
<p>連日來，陳毅殘餘士力第一·四］六］八］兩廣蹤隊及第三縱隊幹部人員，共約六萬人工，自豫·鄂·皖陸續竄回魯西南鄆城，鉅野，城武一帶，如加上原來殘留在曹縣單縣中間及其以東的第十·十一兩縱隊，共達七縱隊之多，一般對陳匪此次</p>
<p>，囘竄的看法</p>
<p>多認　補充兵員，休息整補，但若干人們由此對暢通了僅僅十個星期的津浦　路徐濟段是否將遭遇膠濟路去年此時同樣的命運都爲之惴惴不安，但根據「足食足兵」的原則，陳毅的最大限度亦僅止於破壞徐濟段，但絕不致在徐濟沿綫或沂蒙山區或魯境其他地區有更大的野心或作較久的逗留，原因是旣沒有兵站補給制度的共匪，對業已貧入骨髓的山東農村，在目下此時是無法担負這樣一個龐大野戰軍的給養的。同樣理由：也許在春夏之交，麥苗成熟的季節，倒是共匪主力正式回竄入魯，實行大規模搶食的時候，到那時候，津浦路徐濟段恐將步入通車以來最緊張沉重的階段。（本報特派員麗天）</p>

<h3>香港新動向國內實業轉赴香港找出路英國資金流向澳洲求發展</h3>
<p>〔本　香港廿二日航訊〕今日可說是貧乏英人從事豐滿的收穫的季節吧。在本　廿日香港報上，同時刊出了下列兩條消息：</p>
<p>（一）前任香港股份交易所副主席夏利曼，今日在雪梨發表談話，預言英國資本將由香港轉移至澳洲……本人已將私人之事業轉移至澳洲。</p>
<p>（二）滬實業界紛紛來港籌設大規模工廠，最近約有十四五個單位，其中有紗廠七家，已購　進行興築廠址，由滬來港　廠已開始生產者，有大南紗廠和美琪化工廠，更大規模的「香港紗廠」，大約在兩月後即可開工。</p>
<p>最安全的國家</p>
<p>這兩條消息，透露香港當前的一個重要動向：國內的實業移來香港，香港　資金移向澳洲。本文試就這兩點略加說明。</p>
<p>關於英國資金由香港移往澳洲，據夏利曼說：澳洲是一個最安全的國家，這不僅在太平洋方面如是，就是世界上，在未來的第三次大戰中，或許也找不着另一塊可比澳洲安全的地方。從經濟的眼光看，澳鎊的價値也是相當响亮的。澳洲地廣人稀，資源豐富資金不愁「英雄無用武之地」。當太平洋大戰爆發的前夕，港中英籍婦孺老弱，大批疏散到澳洲去，戰後他們雖重返香港，但那塊肥美的大地在他們的心目中留下深刻的印象。今天他們旣在中國大陸站不住脚，眼望英倫鬧節約，中東劍拔弩張，印度版岡變色，馬來亞杌隉不安，除了遠渡太平洋落殖陌生的加拿大外，澳洲便自然而然的成了一塊理想的去處。</p>
<p>英人拋售物業</p>
<p>早在一九四七年之初，英國資金已暗暗的流出香港。英人開始拋售他們在港中的物業和他們所有各大公共事業或大商行的股票（他們把原來的股份增加四五倍，如電車公司由二百萬元資本額增至一千萬元然後拋出）。吸取大批現金。剛巧國內淤資在那時滾滾流入香港，正中他們飢渴的胃口。據港中經濟界人士佔計：去年一年間，英人拋售他們在港中的物業和股份的所得，約爲五千萬元至一億五千萬元之間，流入澳洲的至少佔半數以上。</p>
<p>在英國資金流出香港　　勢下，中環市　若干大建築物已易了主人，戰時給炸彈轟去頂樓的亞細亞行，在鳩工重築中，也遽然罷手。但在亞細亞行的不遠，却崛赴了一座「勝利大厦」，而斜對面的公主行，又加添了兩層樓，那是一個何等强烈的對比！國內實業移來香港，也可說國內實業擴充至香港找出路，在「八二三」後已有顯著的表現，美亞織綢廠，天廚味精廠，新亞璃廠，捷和鋼鐵廠等，相率來港開　分廠，已使港中原有的實業界另眼相看。</p>
<p>新興實業一瞥</p>
<p>戰後港中新興的實業則　紗廠爲主。已開工　大南紗廠，紡錠五千，每日出紗十二包，即將開工的香港紗廠，紡錠八千，每日出紗十八包，另有兩家經已築成及進行註册的紡廠，規模更大，每廠有一萬五千錠，每日出紗三十包。本港共有大小紡織廠三百餘家，每　需紗約四五千包，那四個紗廠如相繼開工，則可供給港由紡織廠的需要，無待外求。在香港開　紗廠，可得原料和電力之便，但熟練工人缺乏，而工資亦相當高。無怪國內某實業鉅子說：「滬廠遷港，實爲不得已之舉」。</p>
<p>紗廠以外工廠</p>
<p>除紗廠外，港　幷將有大煉油廠，毛絨綫廠，化學工廠，玻璃廠，機　廠，造船廠的出現或新　。據去年十月統計，獲准港府發給工廠牌照的大小工廠，共有八百十一所，到了今年一月，那些獲准註册的大小工廠，已增至一千二百零七所，計九龍半島方面佔九百二十三所，香港方面二百八十四所，而尙未獲准託册的，約有三四百所。可見戰後港中輕工業的長足進步，而其主要的推動力，便是國內實業的轉移，其中也有一部份是上海英人實業的轉移。</p>
<p>算盤一舉兩得</p>
<p>我國實業轉來香港找　路，而英國資金流往澳洲求發展，從表面上很容易誤解那是英人放棄香港的初步徵象，然而事實幷不如理想的快意，據熟悉香港內情的人說，英人此舉是一個以退爲進的策略，他們看見中國的人力財力，這兩三年來，以排山倒海　勢衝進香港，他們正好把握這個「是後　機會」，利用那豐足的人力財力，開發這個南中國貿易最大的吐納口，甚至裝點牠的美麗。他們把這個任務交中國人自辦，而抽調他們自已的實力去開發新目標，這是一舉兩得的如意算盤。</p>
<p>一個中心政策</p>
<p>港府目前的工作，主要的還是維持港幣的穩定和社會秩序的安謐。從港府最近決定擴大市區建設計劃以至舉行公務人員考試，規定學校收費等揹施，追溯日本投降後之初，港府如何打開市塲的僵局，如何配售糧食，如何限制物價……都是發端於一個中心政策，即把香港置　有效率的行政管理下，吸引在動亂中的中國人力財力，來經營發展這個英人在中國經過百年滄桑而碩果僅存的據點。</p>
<p>有一個外國觀察家說，英人在　後是以「管家」的身份再來香港，現在中國實業界向香港轉移，而香港的英人資金流入澳洲，可說是「管家」辛動的成續，也算得陷於戰後貧乏的英人在遠東方面的一個豐滿　收穫！（本報特約記者子健）</p>

<p>參差不一，苞米最俏，黄豆連日上漲過鉅，客帮雖辦，心猶虛軟，而貨主趁高脫手者不乏。漢口乍豆，晨開爲一百五十萬，計降十萬元。入後趨勢更軟，跌至一百四十五萬元，最後因油價豆餅回升，仍升至一百五十萬元。芝蔴因津帮雖不動辦，而貨主亦不願賤價脫手，九江奶蔴開二百九十萬元，微跌五萬元。漢口次白蔴開三百二十五萬元。生仁廣帮吸納，略昂五萬元。苞米靑島帮不斷奮進，而本市存貨並不充裕，啓東包米創二百萬元新紀錄，計漲十五萬元。紅糧稍貴三五萬，菉豆平平。</p>

<h3>棉紗配售辦法紗管會變更施行價格由申購各戶自行填報</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕中國紡建公司，昨奉紗管會通知，自本日（廿五日）起，配紗價格，暫由申購各戶，自行塡報，並由紡建公司參酌市情核定。各購戶配額，仍照原定數額辦理。</p>
<p>昨日售出棉紗總數，連紗管會及紡建公司在內，共達四四四八件，合廿支紗五四六二件，收回銀根達三千億元有零。售出各紗中，紡建公司掛牌售出者二八五〇件，合廿支紗二八五〇件，申購單六五五張。紗管會委託紡建拋售者共一五九八件，合廿支紗二〇八一件，申購單二八八張。</p>
<p>各支紗開出價格，計　、支　日光二六〇〇萬元，八支光三三五〇萬元，十支立馬副藍鳳三六〇〇萬元，廿支紅蜂五八〇〇萬元至大發六二一〇萬元。卅一支仙桃八二五〇萬元，卅一支變股仙桃八六五〇萬元，四〇支　監鳳八五〇〇萬元，四〇支，K彩球儿五〇〇萬元，四二支雙股水月九二〇〇萬元，六〇支日光一六五〇〇萬元。</p>
<p>市場紊亂</p>
<p>又訊：紡建公司昨日開售配紗，因議價問題致造成僵局，昨日棉紗市傷極形紊亂，警局經濟科加派經濟警員嚴密監視市塲，紗管會並在市塲拋售棉紗十六種，但喊價仍極紊亂。四二支竟喊至一萬二千萬高價，廿一支减至七千萬餘元云。</p>
<p>紗價狂漲</p>
<p>昨日棉紗市况，以原料棉花飛騰，廠方供應頗稀，雖有紡建公司屢次懸牌，奈因人心堅秀，各帮見售即吸，塲內祗聞一片呌買之聲，賣戶甚少，粥少僧多，行情再度瘋狂上竄。</p>
<p>四十二支藍鳳細紗，初開即跳高一千九百萬元，突破一億元大關，爲一億零八百萬元。嗣後軋空紛起，檯面帮乘機活動，再創一億一千二百萬元空前之新高峰。迨至近收浮多獲利吐售，稍見回落，至一億零五百萬元收盤，較之上日飛揚一千六百萬元之鉅。此外各支粗細紗，亦均狂升，再創新紀錄。</p>
<p>棉布奔騰</p>
<p>棉布市况，最開時在當局　管之下，買賣雙方，均無顯著活動，塲內絕鮮做開。旋聞北帮在塲外吸收，長江帮亦有進取，並因隔日紡建公司供售之細布及嗶嘰，均挨號配售，原棉存枯價高，外埠游資集滬，染廠進多出少，本廠土布四鄕去路奇暢，更有業外進提，致造成飛馬奔騰之局面。結果十二磅各　細布，比上日狂跳三十餘萬元，此外嗶嘰直貫及士林布等，亦均再創新高峰。</p>
<h3>配售複製業棉紗改採報價核售方式</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕昨日紗布市價，仍高漲不已，紗管會負責人頃發表談話稱二近日各項物價均吿上漲，紗布價格因過去數日壓抑過甚，故此次上漲稍劇。該會爲平抑漲風起見，除已公吿暫停棉紗南運外，並督飭紡建公司，逐日不斷在棉紗市塲拋售棉紗。惟過去紡建公司每逢星期一三五日，對棉紗複製業開售棉紗，均係依照議價，此項議價，尙係過去紡調會所定之辦法。目前二十支紗議價每件四千五百七十萬元，而市價每件則達六千七八百萬元，兩者相差達二千萬元以上，生產成本亦已超出議價甚鉅，但複製業依議價配得棉紗所織成之布，仍依市價出售，故產紗廠家遭受不敷成本之損失，而事實上仍未能收平抑紗布價格之效果。該會經愼重考慮，並請示經濟部陳部長核准，特自本月二十五日起，對複製業配售棉紗，改採報價核售方式，仍由紡建公司依照原定數額，儘量配售云。</p>
<h3>棉織品出口可申請換取原料</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕輸管會本年度之中心工作，已定爲推廣出口與爭取外匯；該會爲此召集有關各業代表，商討實施辦法。前昨兩日巳與棉織業之代表會商，因該業出口希望最大，尤以南洋各地爲然。棉織界人士因輸管會已訂有出口品易取原料辦法，面中信局亦有出口品易紗之辦法，特提出如出口品易取原料有餘，是否尙可易紗之問題，當經商討結果，認爲可分別申請。</p>
<h3>絲綢又見躍升</h3>
<p>人造絲昨市又　飛揚，一二〇號旭字有光，上午開盤價竟抬至五千五百萬元，因價過高而成交甚寥。中午收盤退爲四千八百萬元，下午曾降至四千五百萬元，終又高至九百萬元賣出價。</p>
<p>廠經雖有配售，究因數量甚微，故市價未見抑平。昨市上午成交C字等級價做六千萬元，高另担五千五百萬元，干經普通另担二千二百萬元亦有做開，下午市况仍穩，喊價與上午無異。</p>
<p>綢貨昨市銳升，因原料狂躍，成本激昂，廠盤紛紛提升，華強眞絲被面最大躍至六千三百萬元，收市降爲即期二百萬元。大誠格子璧縐最大到二十八萬元，收市做七萬五千元，其他各貨，亦均增加百分之五至八不等。</p>
<h3>茶市廖落</h3>
<p>茶市仍因執貨者心思堅秀，喊價向上，潛勢迭露鋒鋩，行情益覺蓬勃。惟交易則猶寥落。揆其原因，外銷茶出口商嫌價奇昂，不覺袖手，他若內銷花色，本街與客帮雖續有悅胃，但受貨稀供缺之影響，卒難隨心所欲，僅係零碎做開而己。</p>
<h3>華股買氣大盛小型多種漲停</h3>
<p>華股昨買風熾烈，業外游資來歸，圈外刺激加重，新價層出不第。紗市旣吿停市，小股更爲俏利，景綸國貨新光景福等十餘種咸吿漲停。</p>
<p>晨初人心雖好，但以査禁塲外之訊，使人心稍受阻遏。景綸新股上市，倍受業內外爭購，立吿漲達限度。永紗現遞均以一〇〇〇元之價登塲，九號等均售即交，一七八號等咸賣遞交，退至九八五元及九八三元低價，現遞倒掛。一九七號等爭購即交，七八號並買遞交，塲外息價朋低至二角一分及二角五分半，漲到一〇四五元及一〇四〇元。龔某力事斬多，塲外先事降落，一七八號等趁高脫手即交，八號出還交，退至一〇二五元及一〇一五元。無奈港電慘降，黑市漲風横起，人心復被激動，小股亦普　上漲，十分出色。二三一號等進即交，一二號進遞交，乃漲到一〇六五元及一〇七〇元新高價。銀行帮二二〇號等逢高脫售遞交，並售若干小型股，永紗午收爲一〇六〇元及一〇六五元，景綸閘北中紡恒豐永業均站漲限，新光停後稍回，較前收除永紗美亞信和永公升半成，新光漲停後有回，軋升一成。閘北景綸中紡統益永業恒豐漲停外，餘均好起一成迄二成弱不等。遞交股永紗信和美亞各升半成，餘均漲一成强。</p>
<p>後市遞交循例停做，永紗開出即升爲一〇七〇元，二一八號一〇三號進至一〇八五元，八九號等脫售，塲外有大戶鄭某傾售，立即回小至一〇三〇元。一八八號等趁低進納，但以國行差進，升而多盤，回漲到一〇六〇元，七六號等均售，跌至一〇一五元，二〇二號等力購，收市升爲一〇四〇元。景輪國貨麗安仍站漲限，大通新光中法閘北景福永業華　　停後有回。較晨收計國貨麗安景綸永業漲停，閘北新光景福中法華聨新　榮　大通漲停後有回，軋過榮辱不一，餘股略吿微降。塲外各未上市股票，普遍向榮，各漲一成强。</p>
<p>統益紗廠開始於三月一日發息，該日前市起開做除息交易。</p>
<h3>統債盤漲外股再升</h3>
<p>公債昨盤漲較多，統丙晨開八萬元，先自八萬九退至八萬二，臨收前再見漲到九萬二，而後有回。較前收計甲乙丁戊各升五千元統丙漲九千元，成交約三百萬</p>
<p>外股昨以黑市刺激再劇，港電慘縮，買氣大增，有求少供，洋行帮廣帮證券帮爭購，怡紗自一一三萬開後，創一二五萬新高峯，午後微回，但仍在一二〇萬關外站住，雜股鮮有做開。較前收計怡紗英聯紙版電話各濃　一成半，餘股亦升一成。</p>
<h3>工貸審查結果提請四聨核準</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕四聯總處工貸小組審査會廿三日在此間開會，當時決定分三小組作專門之審查；貸款利率存款等三小組，於昨日分別開會，　加硏討，現已獲有結論。昨日午後三時半，再提出工貸小組審査會重付審查，所獲結論已由四聯總處放款委員會副主任刁培然於　當晚携京，再綜合農貸小組之結果，於下星期四提請四聯理事會通過，並呈請主席批准實施。據悉：出口物資，民生必需品交通事業，公用事業，工礦事業食鹽產運等，均可取得貸款，而以收購定貨委托製造押款等方式借出。押匯聞仍以少做爲原則，利率除小部份仍維持低利，大部以市塲利率訐算；借款期限，亦將在可能範圍內縮短。</p>
<h3>紗廠缺棉堪虞商定補救辦法</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕六區棉紡公會，昨日中午召開第一〇三次常務理事會，討論經過，成以目前棉價　漲，而一部份紗廠存棉缺乏，無法接濟，甚爲憂慮。當推定王啓宇，劉靖基，汪竹一等，赴紗管會謁袁主委，請示辦法。會談結果，商定辦法四點如次：（一）由公會自動査報各廠　際存棉數量，迅予彙報。（二）如遇眞正缺棉紗廠，急須接濟者，經紗管會調査屬實，可採取代紡方式，預先供給原棉，決不使各廠停工。（三）公會即日通知各會員廠，示得在滬自行購棉，以重政府統購棉花法令。（四）紗管會上海倉庫，已有原棉三四十萬担，尙有絡續大量運到，可無缺乏之虞。</p>
<h3>食糖小組開會決定九期臺糖配價嗣後不再隨匯率升降調整</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕本　物價評議會食糖小組，昨開會決議：台糖公司配糖附征之冬令救濟捐，原定征收至本年二月底截止，現決定展至四月十五日止。又爲擴充本市保安經費，自台糖公司第九期配糖起，每擔帶收六萬元。</p>
<p>自台糖公司第九期配糖起，重行調整配價，但以後不再隨台幣匯率升降而調整。批發商利潤自第九期配糖起，亦自百分之十六增至百分之二十。調整後之第九期配糖價格如下：</p>
<h3>調整配價增高六成</h3>
<p>又訊：昨糖市因連日台幣不絕放長，已達一二五元，故台糖公司今日配價，亦大加調整，約增四五六成不一，再加其他敎育基金及保安捐等十三萬元，如赤白靑糖均出二百大關，冰糖所增最多，連附加基金等，已達四百十三萬元。最上特號綿白爲二百七十八萬元，最次台靑爲二百廿三萬元。公會劃盤因此更爲堅挺，現貨二四粗白爲四百萬元至零五萬元，四半車白四百十萬元至十五萬元。二〇中砂白三百二十四五萬元至三十萬元。</p>
<p>土糖亦不甘落後，汕提靑開至二百五十三萬元，興化白三百六十三萬元至六十八萬元。興赤二百五十三萬元，刁靑二百四十八萬元，海南赤普通二百三十五萬元，高貨二百四十五萬元。比魯砂劃三百七十萬元。棧單交易，八期又升十餘萬元，惟九期因配價已增，劃盤初緊後軟，反小四萬元。</p>
<h3>金管局派員調查保險業資金狀況</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕保險公司資金之運用，金管局已派員調查。綠財部爲明瞭該業資金之運用，便於稽考起見，特依照戰時保險業管理辦法之規定，製定表格由上海金管局飭令該業公會遵辦；該局已轉令限於三日內塡報，並派員分赴各公司實地調査。又日來金鈔黑市，又形猖獗，對物價彼動頗有影響，金管局決派員會同市警察局秘密偵査，査獲後將　徵。</p>
<h3>紙張漲勢猛烈</h3>
<p>紙張市面以到存兩稀，更因銀根鬆弛，各方進取甚殷，業外亦有搜吸，致連日市盤頻頻上升。昨漲勢更烈，美貨白報紙每令三百萬出關，高至三百廿五萬元，對開三百零五萬元，較上日均狂漲卅五萬元之鉅。色白打字紙四百萬關外亦高至白四百五十萬元，色四百二十萬元，飛升六十萬至四十萬元。此外道令牛皮玻璃等紙，亦均上升一二成之譜。</p>

<h3>人與醫學</h3>
<p>— 狄山</p>
<p>·西格里斯著·　謙吉譯·商務版「這是一部用歷史敘述寫的醫學通論每一章敘述是一個有趣的歷史故事。」　胡適序</p>
<p>作者西格里斯（H．S．Sigeriut）是瑞士人，他曾在各國居住過，又曾精硏過各國的歷史，他　一位且備國際人生觀和眼光廣博的人。他的早年敎育多半　法國得的；他的學醫硏究是在他的本地沮利克大學做的；他在生津大學紫學過一個時期，因此和英國的學術生活是有接觸的。他後來在來比錫大學担任那全德國最重要的醫學史講座，他的這部「人與醫學」就是在來比錫寫的。這部書原是作者在來比錫大學時，每年給醫科新生的演講，但這部書的價値和功用卻不限於學醫的人們，世界各國都有了譯本，而且廣泛的爲讀者所歡迎。</p>
<p>中文譯本的翻譯和出版卻經過一番週折。一九三三年，北平協和醫學校代理校長顧臨同胡適先生商量，要找一個人譯西格里斯博士的「人與醫學」，胡適先生原希望　基會　編譯委員會可以負担翻譯　費　。不想那時編委會沒有餘力，就由　臨校長個人担負這部譯本　　費　恰好那時學農學的顧謙吉先　　意　評，於是這部世所週知的名著的中譯才得以問世。</p>
<p>全書共分成七篇，包括人與醫學各方面的一知識以及醫學史，作者原是演講稿，所以文字深入淺出，引人入勝，而譯文又情潔明暢，使人讀着毫不生澀。</p>
<p>第一篇說到人，他說：「醫生的思想與行動，總把人做中心點，他們一切的努力，是爲人類治病，和設法保障人類不生病病。「關於醫生，他說：「僅從自然科學方面去觀察人類，決不够醫生所需要的，醫生更應　硏究人在世界上獨有的地位，認識他是一個有智慧的生命，他必須硏究整個的人，必須硏究人的生活經驗的總和。」讀者從西格里斯這種偉大的愛的出發點去讀他的全書，可以說是已經深深地爲他的文字所吸引住了。</p>
<p>在第一篇「人里，他不但吿訴了我們關於人體的結構與機能，他還吿訴了我們「心理與心靈」的重要，他說：「醫生應當與人類並肩走着，望知道空架子幷不能給你醫治和引導病人的能力，這種能力是明瞭人和生活的深切知識得來的。」</p>
<p>第二篇說到「病人」，西格里斯從遠古追溯病人在文化發展上的地位，他指出病人地位最澈底而最斷然的變動，是受基督敎的影響，這種解放人類痛苦的影響，眞是大極，基督敎替病人卸除了罪惡的烙印，使他們　　自由。我們從這一篇文　里，可以瞭然病人地位的歷史演變，然而可以知道病人在現代社會所處的地位。</p>
<p>三四五一十篇包　　的象徽」，「疾病」和「病因」，也可以說是全書最精要的敍述。作者最重要的地方在提示文化發展和歷史演變，時時尊重人與醫學進　的關係，人怎樣克服了一切疾病的侵害，人怎樣爲保障人類安全而奮鬥，人怎樣用智慧發明所有醫治疾病的嶄新治療劑。</p>
<p>在第六篇「醫治」里，西格一里斯反覆指出治療上一切應行注意的狀况，程序和方法。末篇講到醫生」，他吿訴我們醫生的動作不是自由的，醫生有他的責任，這個責任把醫生放在普通道德規律之下。西格里斯並引「派拉賽塞的話：「醫學的起原是愛」所以他說：「熱心扶助人，博愛人類，自然而生的犧牲性，這種性格都是包含在一切醫學理想之內的。』</p>
<p>這部書的最大特色就是他處處使我們明白每一種新學理或新技術的歷史文化背景。是用一般文化作畫布，在那上面畫出醫學的全景來。胡適先生在他的序里說得好：「所以我們可以說這是一部用歷史叙述法寫的醫學通論，每一章叙述是一段歷史，是一個故事，是一個很有趣味的歷史故事。」</p>
<p>譯本田胡適先生校並序，初版於民國廿四年，直到去年商務才再版收在「新中學文庫」裏，於此可以想見此書在我國還不曾引起衆多讀者的注意。筆者敢爲介紹，使這部偉著成爲每個知識份子的讀物，進而對我國廣大的不具備新醫常識的文盲有所帮助。</p>
<h3>讀書興趣漫談</h3>
<p>— 芒</p>
<p>（杜佐周等著，中國文化服務社印行）</p>
<p>讀書這件事使許多讀書的人感覺到苦痛，雖然有了良好的讀書方法，也有適宜讀書的環境，但是還是使人感到苦痛，旣然認爲讀書是一件苦痛的事，當然不會呌人好好的讀，即使强迫了去讀，還是沒有效果，這是什麼原因呢？最大的關鍵還是在有沒有讀書的興趣。</p>
<p>讀書本來是一件人生　　的事情，讀書的人能够從書本裏得到眞理和正義，獲得關於人生的一切秘密，因此，許多對讀書這件事發生興趣的人，他們無時無刻不想到讀書，不讀書就不快樂。我們爲什麽反而不喜歡讀魯？就是我們對讀書沒有發生興趣，怎樣使我們對讀書發生興趣呢？看起來這似乎是一個困難的問題，但實行起來並不困難，這裏介紹你一本書，書名是「讀書興趣漫談」，這裏面指示你如何培養你的讀書興趣。</p>
<p>「讀書興趣漫談」是一本僅有八十餘面的小册子，內含二十餘簾文章，內容完全是關於讀書興趣的培養，讀書的方法，態度等，每一篇都由一人或兩人執筆，他們說出了自己的讀書心得，讀書的方法，對於讀書的人顯然有很大的帮助，似乎有介紹的價値。</p>
<p>開首的一篇是「論爲學之道」，短短的數千言却把治學的方法，態度分析得淸淸楚楚，對於一般讀死書，死讀書和學不　致用的人尤有正確的指示。關於治學的方法更有獨到的見解，而對於所謂「天才」不知努力，自暴自棄的這種精神認爲是不足取的，就是要我們加倍努力才好！</p>
<p>如在「如何培養讀書興趣」一文中，作者討論甚詳，並列舉各點，如：讀書要出於自願；認淸讀書的目的；讀書應有刻苦自勵的精神；讀要精而博；以及其他各點，都是我們讀書者的通病，關於如何改正，另有祥細的指示。</p>
<p>又如在「關於讀　」中，把我們讀書的目的，讀些什麽書，如何去讀書，各點都加以說明和指示。並且指出了我們的只憑紀憶，不加思量，讀書沒有融會貫通的毛病。現在學校裏的考試制度更使大多數學生變成如此的習慣，上課只看書聽講，全憑記憶應付考試，强記的學間，考過後便丢得乾乾凈凈，這是多麽嚴重的問題！</p>
<p>其他各篇也有獨特之處，爲了避免麻煩起見，茲不一一舉出，最後更由好幾人寫出自己所喜歡閱讀的書籍，並且說出所以喜歡閱讀的理由，譬如周予同喜讀「新學僞經考」，由這本書爲機扭，而把握住了數千年的中國文化的動態。又如胡山源喜讀「義勇少年」，是因爲牠裏面有一句格言：「只要作事正直，莫問成敗，利鈍，損益」。當然還不止這兩篇，其他的也從略了。</p>
<p>總之，本書無論如何是一本很好的指導書，對於讀書沒有興趣的人，即使是讀書有興趣而還沒有成功的人，都是有非常大的利益的，不但是指示，讀書的方法和興趣的培養，並且還涉及到應該讀什麽書，讀書的境地等，確是給讀書者的一盞指示明燈！因此，讀過本書的人應該盡一種責任。就是把這本書再介紹給那些對讀書沒有興趣的人，使他們從讀書中得到快樂。</p>
<p>你要使你對讀書發生興趣嗎？那麼，我勸你讀這本書。</p>
<h3>〔給下一代〕</h3>
<p>— 亦秀</p>
<p>沐紹良著　商　印書館印行　定價二元五角　一〇四頁</p>
<p>重振國民道德，實在是今天極感迫切的當務之急。戰前我們有過五四新文化運動，有過舊道德復古運動，有過新生活運動，今天，我們仍舊需要有一個重振國民道德，運動。在這一運動　對象中，尤其重要的是血氣未定的靑年。所謂「靑年是國家的主人翁」，「靑年是民族國家的棟樑」，這一代的靑年如果有道德有修養，有公理是非，有正義感，那末這一代的國家才有希望。特別是靑年們大多是純潔的，坦白的，易感染的，所以貫輸新的道德觀念，道德意識，也就較易接受，較易爲爲力，而且也特別重要。所以對於靑年們，我覺得這件事節直不是什麽「重振」了，因爲壞的靑年一直就祗有極少數。</p>
<p>本　以書信體裁寫就，目錄「第一信：從舊的蛻變出來」（論公民這德），「第二信：天道何曾分善惡」（論善惡與因果）「第三信：離　索居的至人」（論個人與社會）；「第四信：做一個無名英雄」（論積極與消極）；「第五信：從最後勝利說起」（論忠與孝）；「第六信：一個幸福的家庭」（諭父與母）；「第七信：違背人性的美德」（論勤與儉）；「第八信：就算是諸葛亮吧」（論名與利），「第九信；馬克吐溫與曹操」（論做人的態度），「第十信：應該怎樣應付人「（論處世與交友）；「第十一信：蠟炬成　　淚始乾」（論工作的意義）；「第十二信：自强不息的人生」（論工作的態度）</p>
<p>一看上面的目錄，就覺得作者對於古今中外，都當作了話題，不知他將如何把這些駁雜紛亂的事物，在一貫的道德見解下處理牠們。像這樣的寫法，顯然是吃力不討好的；如果一不小心，就很可能寫成一册新式的「太上感應篇」。可是本書的著者沐紹良先生，他不但有精闢獨到的見解和思想，而且更有一枝活潑風趣的文筆；思想旣足以駕馭文筆，文筆又能充分渲染思想，讀完這一本薄薄約七八萬字的全書之後，只覺得輕鬆愉快，却又充實有力，絕不如一般的勸善規過之書，令人一打開就頭痛，即使勉强讀完了也索然寡味。作者在十二封信中，把各種這德問題，娓娓道來，　重心長，深入淺出，而回味又極雋永。更値得可喜的是：內容重趣味而不油滑，談道理而通俗化，無刻板的敎條，無驚遠的高論，一言一字，全從實際事物說起，旣平易，又踏實，絕無不着邊際的空談，確是一本値得推薦的佳作！</p>
<p>作者把若干中國舊道德（如四維八德等等）加以一番新的詮釋，揚棄了其中不合理不合時保守陳腐的部分，同時又注入了一些新的進步的社會道德觀　，處理得非常恰當。在全書中，除發揮其一貫的理論之外，又可以發現不少作者精警的創見。</p>
<p>本書最大的特色，就是切合目前的現實，對靑年作親切有味的指導。就現實立論，就現實加以針砭，加以批判，不奢談未來怎樣怎樣美麗的遠景以及在那個遠景需要建立怎樣相稱的完善無缺的道德修養，他不唱高調（却並不落伍），始終抓着現實，誠是切要之至。至於寫信的形式，也値得靑年們學習；作者娓娓動聽地，有層次地，委婉曲折地，用淸麗如瀉的文筆叙述下來，殊令讀者喜悅。</p>
<p>寫這一類的書容易，要寫得好却難。同時各人見仁見智，看法不同，批評也極不易，而本書對此，却全無缺憾，如果說本書有什麽缺點的話，那末似乎是範圍還不够大，方面還不够廣（例如本書中未曾論及戀愛問題，這問題對靑年是如何重要啊！）照筆者的推測，著者還可以第十三封信，第十四封信的繼續寫成一一册，將戀愛等問題也逐一提出而加以論列指導，則對靑年們的益處就更大了。</p>
<p>在道德修養方面缺乏好書的今日，我願向全國靑年們推薦這册書。</p>

<p>Freda　Utley原著　華君剛譯</p>
<p>民治出版社發行　上海福州路獨立出版社代售</p>
<p>作者在開宗明義第一章中便說：「我要寫一本關於中國的書，而且要寫來不雜一些偏見。偏見是難免的，我對於共產和民主主義，便方點偏見。」從這句話中，我們已知道這位作者是想替中國的民生主義者說幾句公道話。</p>
<p>在結論中，她又引希特勒一句話：「謊說得愈大，人民愈相信。謊話，人們是很喜　　的。但如果弄得自己騙自己，這就就危險得很了。多少年來雜誌中充滿　　　家的文章。他們所寫的，雖然完全是虛假的，說謊的，但究竟爲人們所愛聰。雜誌所注意的就是銷路，至於眞理如何，那是不管的。」這可以見她對於那些　曲事實的　傳家是如何的痛恨。</p>

<p>她以爲「要批評中國的政治，必須先了解她的歷史背景和實際情形。中國目前的問題，就是如何求取統一與强盛，而同時又不致放棄民主的道路，如何能够把需要一二百年完成的改革，在一二十年之內完成，而並不用恐怖暴力的方法。在中國還留着一種溫和的，古老世紀的道德觀念。中國人有一稱對於　個人尊嚴與自由的强烈的意識。任何外國人到中國來，都要以中國那種人與人間的社會性的民卞爲異。完全不同階級的人民，富的，窮的，官吏，商人，學者，工人，或是農民，他們都可以自由自在地談話，再低微一點的職業者也不會感到自己是奴隸。他們雖然窮，但我行我素，絕不失去自尊心。中國人，至少在精神上，是十分自由的，中國人需要眞正的援助與實際的，有建設性的忠吿，但並不需要扳起面孔的敎訓。我們必須認識：今日中國之弱，是由於八年抗戰所受的穩種損傷和共黨的肆意破壞。美國如果明白聲明支持中國，這對於中國將有很大的　助。如果中國得到我們的幫助而成爲一個民主的强國，這對於自由世界將大有好處。」</p>
<p>單獨爲民主作戰</p>
<p>她的結論是：</p>
<p>（一）中國必須得到支援，勿再使其獨立撑住這一條世界戰略的前綫。美國如果不願中國爲共產黨所吞食，就必須全力支　它，使它不再單獨地爲民主國家作戰</p>
<p>（二）在經濟方面，我們必須了解，今日美國的對華援助，雖然比戰前的援助數量已大得多，但鑒於其國土之廣大，人口之衆多，以及戰後建設與革新工作的繁重，這個數量還是不够的。美國的援助必須眞正能發生效果，情况才能改善。要恢復中國的生產力量所需要的錢，在比例上說，比在歐洲所需要的要小得多。總共，大約二十至三十億美元的援助就可以足够了。</p>
<p>「美國決不可爲人蒙蔽，必須放棄它那種舉棋不定的矛盾政策，而採取一種堅定的，遠見的，有政治家風度的政策，來運用美國的力量和影響。</p>
<p>「美國人在中國現在巳是最後關頭了。這個最後關頭，也許可能延續相當時期，但無論如何，愈到後來，情形將愈糟，現在，我們必須立即重新裝備中國政府軍隊，支持愛國的中國人，以遏制那批想把中國拖進蘇維埃範圍的媚外份子。這種種，現在正是最好的時機。歷史當然可能有不少的轉折和變換。我不是預言家，難以指出這一天或那一天是眞正的最後關頭。但我覺得毫無疑問地，中國的命運和我們的命運，都要在最近　將來決定了。」</p>
<p>作者是個遠東　專家，有名的記者。「日本的泥足」便是她從前著作，在日本侵略時，她要美國援助中國。現在又在那裏呼籲援助中國，防止她再受人侵略了。</p>
<h3>讀〔蕭伯納傳〕</h3>
<p>— 卜束</p>
<p>赫里斯著　黃嘉德譯</p>
<p>他是地球上的標準居民。……曾經被稱爲二十世紀的伏爾泰，但無疑的也將成爲二十一和二十二世紀的伏爾泰。」</p>
<p>去年八月廿六日，是蕭伯納的九十歲誕辰，世界各地的報章雜誌，都有紀念文字發表，我認爲蘇聯E。亞爾莫佐夫的「文學上的米施　拉」一文的評論，最爲中　　，也最有　見。（此文後由何家槐先生譯出，刊登於今年十一月廿三日大公報的「星期文藝」版。）最近讀了赫理斯的「蕭伯納傳」，對於蕭翁的愛說「笑話」，自然有了較深的理解，不過我仍同意E·亞爾莫佐夫的話：「蕭翁是地球上的標準居民。」</p>
<p>赫理斯　蕭伯納的畏友，和蕭一起幹過新聞工作，不過更多的時候，他倒是以「性心理學家」的姿態出現的。在赫理斯寫作「蕭伯納傳」之先，蕭一再表示反對，但最後還是提供了材料和意見。赫理斯死後，全書原稿且由蕭伯納自己　閱。他說他並不同意赫理斯的意見，不過又認爲赫理斯也自有他的看法，如果把此書作爲蕭伯納傳中的一章「蕭對於兩性問題的意見」或「蕭的性史」看，他倒是贊同赫理斯的寫法的。</p>
<p>整部「蕭伯納傳」所烘托出的未必是眞實的蕭，而是赫理斯眼中的蕭，但如果我們承認赫理斯有敏銳的眼光與絕不妥協的卓見的話，則從赫理斯式的透視鏡望出去，多少也可以看到蕭伯納的某一面目。這些　尷尬面目是邱斯脫頓（G．K．Chetercon）的「蕭伯納評傳」和孫格塔（S．C．San　Gupte）的「蕭伯納的藝術」中所看不到的。赫理斯寫過不少傳記，甚至也寫過莎士比亞傳，他的看法不免有所偏，但不能說他絕無所見。他寫作「蕭伯納傳」的情形亦然。在這部傳記中，他忽略了一般人所重視的，而重視了一般人所忽略的，諸如「蕭伯納的女人們」「蕭伯納的兩性觀」諸章，可以說在赫理斯之前，沒有人在這範疇中探討過，因此這幾章，也可以說是全書中最奇警的幾章。</p>
<p>但不是說除了兩性問題以外，這部傳記就不足觀了。事實是，在蕭伯納傳的撰著人中，也許還是赫理斯最具有批評眼光。在第十章「蕭伯納的社會主義」里，赫理斯對蕭伯納的思想精神，有極深刻的批評，他否認蕭伯納是哲學家，因爲他沒有自己的思想體系；他又抨擊蕭在第一次歐戰中的搖擺姿態，說他一回兒想與羅曼羅蘭等聯盟，站在「世界人」的立塲上反戰，一回兒却又變成一個道地的國家主義者。在第十八章「技巧」和第十九章「比莎士比亞更偉大？」中，他對蕭伯納的寫劇技巧有微言，也否定了他的缺乏勢力的作風。這些批評都不失爲一種卓見，無論如何，不是　一般和事老的口吻。赫理斯之所以始終能成爲蕭的諍友，原因在此。</p>
<p>正因爲蕭伯納在年輕時，有一段相當長的時期跟赫理斯在一起工作，而且蕭　字生涯和赫理斯的辦雜誌生涯也常常糾經在一起，所以赫理斯比較熟悉蕭　靑年時代的奮鬥生活。從第二章「一八六〇年代的愛爾蘭」到第八章「在倫敦的落魄時代」，所寫　的全是蕭的奮鬥生涯，不過處處有赫理斯的評論與注釋，他的看法也決不像一般的傳記作家那樣庸俗。</p>
<p>尤可貴的是，「蕭伯納傳」的前言中，有幾封蕭給赫理斯的信，談及他自己過去的生活，是極重要的文壇史料。最後的「跋」，是蕭伯納校閱全文後對這本傳記所寫的意見，而主要的倒是在論赫理斯的爲人與作品，所以亦可作爲「蕭伯納論赫理斯的論文讀。蕭的「跋」寫得相當機智，其幽默味不下於附錄在第十七章中的「蕭的兩性觀」里的一封坦率的自白書。</p>
<p>蕭機智而坦率，唯一長處是肯對任何人講眞話，然而偏偏他的眞話會被人當作笑話聽。所以最後，他就以「世界上最偉大的笑話商人」自視。他說他寫「笑話」對象，都是人們所忽視的平凡事物，不渦經他用較坦率的話說出，因此反被認爲可笑了。在回答托爾斯　責備他媧於愛笑的書信中，他曾經說過如下的話：</p>
<p>「爲什麼幽默和笑要受禁止的處分呢？假定這個世界事實上只是上帝的一個笑話，那末你是不是就要放棄把它從壞的笑話變成好的笑話的努力呢？」</p>
<p>因此，即使當他承認自己是笑話商人的時候，他也不是一個「笑話而笑話」的人，他是一個想把壞的笑話變成好的笑話的偉人，「幽默」只是他的工具或手段而已，他並不像我們的笑話匠那麽閑適。</p>
<p>蕭是一個社會主義者，費邊社員，和平主義者，素食主義者，絕　戒酒者……然而其實，他一方面也是個大矛盾體：他贊成戰爭，也反對戰爭；贊成民主政治，而反對國會；贊成進化　，而反對達爾文；贊成國家主義，而反對愛國主義；贊成男女的貞靜與拘謹，而反對檢査制度。就在他的戲劇和小說中，也顯出了兩個蕭：</p>
<p>「這　蕭，在如何才能贏得「美好的適意的生活」的方法上，並不能意見一致，其中之一，曾在他的著作中很明顯地指出：爲了要使人們合理地生活，必須先改造社會環境。這個蕭寫了一些「不愉快」的戲。但另一個蕭，却想　如果要使生活變成有意義，有價値，那末首先必須改造自己；這個蕭愛寫變態生理的劇本。這個「不愉快」的蕭，是個現實主義者和社會主義　。那一位愛寫變態生理劇本的蕭，卻是個理想主義者。這個—不愉快」的蕭是個偶像的破壞者；但那另一位變態生理學者呢，却是「生命之力的信徒」。』（E·亞爾莫佐夫語）</p>
<p>把蕭這樣解剖一下，—一面是現實主義者，一面是理想主義者；一面是戰鬥者，一面是妥協者。——我們也許可能與籲的心靈更貼近了些。每個人都有他內心的鬥爭，這種鬥爭仍無損於他的偉大，因爲他是人，不是神。作爲一個人，蕭是無愧的；而赫理斯的「蕭伯納傳」中，儘多這個『人」在現　社　　　鬥爭的紀錄。</p>

<h3>室中探梅</h3>
<p>— 何苦</p>
<p>春天剛剛透露一點消息的時候，據杭州來人說，假期中的游客已經　湧而至，目的是到孤山去看梅花。梅花之巳經放蕊，當我在陰曆大除夕走過望平街一帶時就可看到，那裏有大批賣花人出售天竹，臘梅，此外還　盆景的紅綠梅，與盆景的松竹梅歲寒三友圖等。於是猜想到素以梅花名之區，如孤山，超山，鄧尉，梅園等地，此時定是競勝鬥艷，以冷寂孤芳，報吿春夭之來臨。</p>
<p>可是住在上海實在太苦，近郊竟沒有可以探梅的名勝之區，這或許是俗不容雅的道理，若是到鄙人故鄉鄧尉去，梅樹是觸處皆是，田莊屋角，都可以看到一株二株，一入山野，到處有梅香從微風中送來，初不必跑到香雪海才可以欣賞梅花的。其實探梅不必劃到雅人韻事這筆賬上去，人們有搬往自然的天性，尤其在都市裏混慣了的人們，誰不想出去透透空氣，轉換一下沉濁的環境？祗是生活的拘束太甚，沒有機會出游，因此探梅一事，只能讓閑人去當雅事了。</p>
<p>然而你不出游，自有人從郊野折了斷枝梅花到小菜塲裏去賣，我就買了一束回來，供在花瓶裏，儼然是一個梅林了。旣然不能超山鄧尉去探梅，何妨就在室中探一回梅花。而且古人已經說過，「花香不在多」，有一瓶梅花，就足够我的夢游於香雪海了，我就有這份一望梅止渴」的樂觀精神。</p>
<p>昔人在大除夕過窮年，聽見人家爆竹喧鬧，燭影搖紅，自己屋裏冷冷淸淸，於是寫詩一首自慰，結句是：「揷了梅花便過年」。我不能到江南名勝之區去探梅，只能迴旋於裝斗室中，欣賞梅花，套用昔人舊句取譬，無非是「揷了梅花便探春」也。</p>
<h3>訪豐子愷先生</h3>
<p>— 風人</p>
<p>一個風雨的下午，我和裕生兄去訪問豐子愷先生，到裏西湖招賢寺，向左轉個灣，就看見一幢小巧的中式房子，兩扇搖門向馬路開着。走進客堂，裕生兄就呌：「豐先生，有客人來看你了。」</p>
<p>「啊，我在洗脚。」裏面一個爽朗愉快的聲音。不久，豐先生沒有穿好　子就出來了，損毀呼我坐下之後，大家就很隨便地談起來。</p>
<p>自然談到豐先生的畫，他說：「我的畫，都是杜撰的，我看着一株活的樹，就把它當做畫帖。」這其實是創造，可是豐先生却客氣地說是「杜撰」。豐先生的畫，早已活在千百萬讀者的心裏了，用不着我來贊一詞。我說：「豐先生的散文和畫一樣使我喜歡！」他又客氣地說：「慚愧，慚愧，我懶得很，好久不寫文章了，因爲寫文章比較吃力，文章要深入，　是平面的。」我又問：「豐先生還到浙大去敎課嗎？」他笑笑說：「賣畫還勉强可以過日子，也懶得去敎課了。」</p>
<p>豐先生問起我的故鄕，我說是紹興鄉下。他又問鄕下什麼地方，我說是皋埠，他說：「開明老闆章錫琛你認識嗎？他也是紹興鄕下—馬山人。」我說：「有點曉得，馬山離我家不遠。」他就很親熱地吿訴我，「章先生回家去了，他去看他老母的病，他老母已八十多歲了。」</p>
<p>最後我們辭了出來，他一定要送，我說：「地下濕」把他攔住了。當我們走出大門的時候，還有見他站在客堂門口，和藹地笑着說：「天晴再來。」</p>
<p>在許多「名人」的訪問中，這是最愉快的一次，好像去見了一位久別重逢的長輩，一種溫暖的　覺，永遠留在我的心裏。</p>
<h3>米能治病</h3>
<p>— 國平</p>
<p>在今日之下，米不但能療飢；而且也能治病。或許大多數人祗能同意上半句話，而對於下半句話一定可能不信，至少要懷疑的。然而事實上，米在今日也成了一種藥，因爲米能醫治高血壓症，　　　　　　　　。</p>
<p>加拿大的　利博士因爲見到戰時英國在空襲期內，人民特別多着患胃潰瘍的病，所以他便從事於研究這原因。結果於胃潰瘍的病症中，發現這病是能致使人民患高血壓症。薩利博士便試騐用何種藥物可以醫治高血壓症，最後發現凡少含蛋白質和鹽而多糖的飲食品是有效的，恰與狄克大學的開普納博士所發現「米」可以醫治高血壓的原理相符合，因爲米是少蛋白質和鹽的食物。開普納博士曾發表於報章上面說過，數千年來中國人的食物——米——的確能治高血壓。或許有人會問，難道中國人沒有一個因患高血壓而死於中風或血管硬化症嗎？那麽薩利博士曾發表過一個簡單而準確的定理說：「假如你身體中是有一碗飯或一塊巧克力糖，而不是一杯牛奶或一塊牛排，那你能免於患高血壓而增長生命。」可見假如多吃了肉類和脂肪的食物後會有患病高血壓的可能。</p>
<p>一個開普納醫生的病人，是卅二歲的婦人，當她生下第十個孩子後，便患了嚴重性的高血壓。她有達二百五十次的心臟收縮數和一百七十四次的心臟擴張數。當她到達醫生處，差不多是昏厥得要死去，連上幾小時的人事不省。但畢竟是醫好了。此後開普納醫生在「紐約醫學公報」上發表一篇說，他以爲這婦人唯一的救星是絕對的吃「米食品」，如飯，粥等，其次再附食些糖，水菓和水菓汁。在兩期的如此服法後，她的血壓自二百五十次的心臟收縮降爲一百五十六次。在第五十二天，她在每一方面都和正常人的標準一樣。</p>
<p>開普納證明在二百十三位病人中有一百三十位是因食米食品而痊愈，祗有七十五位的病人是沒右進步。至今醫學界對於高血壓無特效藥前，米的功效可以說是「首屈一指」的了。</p>
<p>今日美國人已認爲米是患高血壓者的唯一希望，不久的將來，米也許會成爲美國主要的食品之一。</p>
<h3>不祥之人</h3>
<p>— 無咎</p>
<p>一八六五年四月十四日夜間，美的林肯大總統正坐在福特戲院的包廂裏看看戲。突然，黑影中出現了一個鬱鬱不得志的伶人約翰·蒲斯，他關進了總統的包廂，對總統的的頭部開了一槍。總統的隨從和戲院職員們立即把總統舁送到對街一家人家的一間小室中安臥，至明晨七點二十二分，總統傷重逝世。</p>
<p>總統臨終時，房間中約有二十五人侍奉在側，而立在總統身邊的，則是總統的長公子羅勃脫·林肯（Robert　Todd　Lincoln）。</p>
<p>這時，大家已經知道，凶手是當代名伶愛德溫·蒲斯的胞弟。</p>
<p>十六年後，在一八八一年七月二日，茄斐爾總統走進了華府火車站的候車室，準備到新英格蘭去旅行。　衆中突然走出了一個不速之客，名呌却爾斯·紀都，他一看見總統便拔出了手槍，對準總統連開了致命的兩槍。</p>
<p>林肯公子是當時目擊兇徒行刺的證人之一。</p>
<p>二十年後，在十九〇一年九月六日，麥金萊總統是白發洛地方泛美博覽會上的貴賓。大家正在興高采烈之際，無政府主義者沙而果斯突然向總統開了兩槍，總統因傷重逝世。</p>
<p>而林肯公子却又是在塲目擊凶徒行刺的證人之一！</p>
<p>在全部美國史中，祗有三位總統是被暗殺殞命的，而竟有這樣一個人目覩了一位總統之死，也目覩了其他兩位總統之遇刺。</p>
<p>麥金萊總統逝世後，林肯公子漸漸有一種異樣的感覺‘他自視爲一個不祥之人，不利於白宮主人。以後雖然他經常收到許多中總統府發出的請柬，他却總是加以拒絕，一直到一九二六年他自己去世爲止，他從來沒有見過任何總統一面。</p>
<p>林肯公子的自願迴避，當然是誰也不能厚非的，實在造化弄人，這些事情發生得太巧了。而他之深信宿命，却還有一個第四個原因。</p>
<p>這件事發生在他父親遇刺之前。據林肯公子自己說「在南北戰爭期中，我在哈佛大學攻讀。一日正値假期，我靠在一節火事的外壁上，等候他們代我找一個舖位。不想火車突然開動，我身體一晃，差一點跌到車輪下面去，那時幸虧火車中有一個不相識的乘客一手把我抓住，拖進了車廂。</p>
<p>你說這種事情沒有什麼希奇，是不是？可是，你要知道，如果當時沒有這個人見義勇爲，把他拖住，林肯公子早作輪下寃死之鬼了。</p>
<p>你也許又說：「乘客失足墜車也是常有的事情，你所認爲奇怪者，無非因爲遇險的是一位總統的公子而已！」</p>
<p>不。林肯公子的自述中還有一句話：「後來我知道了那位救我性命的人的姓名，他名呌愛德溫，蒲斯。」</p>
<p>誰知道，在數年之後，他恩人的胞弟竟就是刺死他父親的兇手呢！</p>
<h3>化外之民</h3>
<p>— 楊實</p>
<p>在一般人的意料之外，德國到現在還有一小部份土地沒有被盟國佔領。這塊領域呌保辛金（Buesingen），上面住着安居樂業的德國居民有九百多人。原來這塊土地是在瑞士國土內，四邊完全被瑞士包圍着，牠算是德意志聯邦的一小城邦，從一八〇九年起就是德國　國土了。德國投降後，他們便和他們的祖國斷了連繫，而精明的英，美，蘇，法當局也沒有想起這塊小土地。於是他們就處於自由地位了。現在這九百居民中有一個聯盟，和瑞土地方當局也互派使節，經當時行着「國」的一切商務運　。</p>
<h3>逍遙花</h3>
<p>— 陳慎言</p>
<p>第十一章　滿腹疑雲　八〇</p>
<p>渚齋停了一會，又問道：「剛才來的那一位姓什麽？」綺紈北時臉上淚痕已擦乾，臉朝到外面，向渚齋看了一眼，應道：「你問那位繆慮長嗎？他是新中南方飛來的，辦理接收事情，你問他幹什麽？」渚齋道：「沒什麼。我認爲最近新來許多新貴新人物，都不是好對付的，尤其是軍人，他們中很有幾個對於北方女人，不大尊重，這一點我是最不贊成的，這位繆處長是誰給你介紹？我看以後你別和他接近，這種人都是不懷好意的。」綺紈見渚齋說時，臉色很是緊張，心裏明知他這話，的確是好意，不過此時若是以好意答謝他，則昨晚一番工作，究全失效了，當下祗冷冷應道；「那見得都不是好人！我不贊成你的話。」渚齋見她向來沒有這樣頂過他，當下心裏很不痛快，仍耐着性兒，婉言勸道：「我的話是有根據的，最近　蘭芬認識一位軍界白處長，由他玩了一氣，染了一身惡疾，結果不要了，現在蘭芬還在醫院養病，這不是一個榜樣嗎？」綺紈聽了，明知渚齋所說的，都是事實，但他說的話，過於質直一點，當下便把臉一沉道：「你說什麽？難道我和蘭芬是一樣嗎？」渚齋給綺紈又頂了一句，便低下頭去。綺紈見渚齋的臉色窘得很是難看，心中突又不忍，道：「你所說的理由，我很明瞭，你的好意，我很感謝，不過我和這位繆處長結識，是有作用的，這其中原因，一時不能吿訴你。昨晚承你出去找我，累了你一夜，我很不渦意，現在你也該回去歇歇，我也要歇歇了。」說着，山被窩裏，伸出一隻乎，向渚齋握一握，說道：「你走吧！」渚齋想要再說幾句，給她這樣半熱半冷的話一說，倒怔住了，再看綺紈說完這幾句話，把臉往裏一轉，將紅緞被一扯，蒙頭蓋上，渚齋連呌兩聲，見她不答應，祗好訕訕退出臥室。剛走到樓梯旁，小王媽迎頭攔住道：「徐先生上那裏去！不在這裏吃飯嗎？」</p>
<h3>電化教育在美國</h3>
<p>— 毛毅</p>
<p>「電化敎育」是一種新型且有效的敎育。我國敎育當局近年來亦曾提倡電化敎育，不過，也許限於經費與材料，並未見如何普遍。美國在本世紀初就提倡電影進入敎室，但是，一般的美國敎師當時對影片並不重視。在一九三六年，據美國敎育部的統計，全美的公立學校一共不過祗有四百八十五架有聲電影放映機。但是，到了今天，使用中的十六糎放映機却膨脹到三萬五千架光景了。人口超過十萬的城市的學校有四分之三都有電化敎育的設備，居民在三萬與十萬之間的城市的學校亦有一半多有此種設備。</p>
<p>第二次世界大戰給予敎育電影劇烈的推進。戰爭工業的工人學會了新的技巧。從未開過槍的人迅速的知道了高射飽的秘密；新兵變成了坦克專家。據美國軍方的估計，在一九四五年的一個月之中，訓練電影的士兵觀衆的累積數在美國是一千八百五十萬名，在歐洲是五千三百萬名，在其他區域也有大量的士兵在觀摩。這些影片從衛生到砲擊無所不有——大大的縮短了軍訓的時間。</p>
<p>今天，這種戰時的經驗在美國被廣泛的應用——使敎育更快速，更豐富，更有用和更持久。</p>
<p>活潑的卡通片使米老鼠成了一個家喩戶曉的名字，如今影片使學生能够迅速的領會人體神經糸的奇妙的工作，或者血流，或者太陽系的莊嚴的韻律。從電影中，生物學生能够眼看着一顆靑蛙卵成長成一隻成熟的靑蛙；將十五個星期的自然科課程縮短爲十分鐘。正如伊凡斯頓的一個督學大衛華克所說的：「我雖然不能够到南極去，但是裴爾德探險隊的攝影機却能把它帶給我」。</p>
<p>利用電影，大演員們將文學之美帶進了敎室。在規模宏大的火學裏的科學家所作的實驗可以「化身」無數次讓在最疏遠的學校裏的學生們也能够目睹到。各種不同的專門性的敎育電影，如今美國都在攝製。</p>
<p>敎育並非僅祗是認識種類繁多的漠不相關的事實而已。除非這些事實被交織入實生活之中，它們是徒勞無益的。這也就是一切的大教育家對真正的教育所持的理想。教育電影使他們的理想更容易實現？敎育電影並不减低優秀的敎師的重要性，正如望遠鏡並沒有淘汰天文家一樣。它祗是供給了更好的敎育工具，使優秀的敎師變成更優秀的敎師。</p>
<h3>元日</h3>
<p>— 陳蒙庵</p>
<p>敝裘已忍隔年寒，好語經心强自寬，聒耳春聲驚殺伐，訂盤世味雜辛酸；莫因短鬢空嗟老，要醫長瓶獨盡歡，坐覺初陽回暖律，漫言口燥與唇乾。</p>
<h3>除夕</h3>
<p>— 陳蒙庵</p>
<p>新年明日是，長夜短更催，爆竹千家競，鐙花一翦開；不眠寒透幕，倚醉酒傾杯，往事空追憶，悠悠首獨回。</p>
<h3>對聯的新運用</h3>
<p>—</p>
<p>在平津報紙上，見到上海吳市長及潘議長的春聯，此間各當局及名流，亦撰聯頒發商家住戶，詞意警切，具有時代性。對聯之實際應用，日益顯著。對偶的文學，為中華文字特搜之國粹，爲世界各國所不能有。因爲漢字是「方體單昔」，字字所占空格相同，故能成立偶文之紐織，一童與一音相準，一形與一形相並，這絕對不是聯體拚音，長短不齊的西文所能辦到。偶文在各式文體裏隨處需用，但最顯然的則是對聯。對聯是純然以偶文紐成，且比較詩詞歌賦那些來得特別整潔易明。故硏究各類偶文，必以對聯爲基礎，而對聯又獨立自成一稱文學，慶祝，衰輓，留題，諧謔，園亭，第宅，攸往咸宜。最普遍大衆的莫過於春聯，因爲新年頭上家家戶都作興貼副簇新的門對，便覺氣象一新。</p>
<p>春聯的開始，相傳是蜀孟昶的機符五字對，義取吉祥。但後來擴大了，有善頌善　的如「國恩家慶」「人壽年豐」，「帝德乾坤大」「皇恩雨露深」，「皇恩春浩蕩」「文治日光華」。有名士牢騷的，如「捫心只有天堪恃」「知足當爲世所容」，如「十年心比梅花冷」「一夕春隨爆竹來」。有貼切本業的，如煤舖之「巨古山林餘刦燒」「萬家烟火賴薪傳」，如理髮館之「到來俱是彈冠客」「此去應無搔首人」，應時應景，且有寓意，語妙雙關，都是佳作。至如浴所之「金鷄未唱湯先然」「紅日初升客滿堂」那就過於寫實，沒有言外的寄托，不够文學的價値了。至於民國以來，最流傳衆口的一聯「男女平權，公說公有理，婆說婆有理。」「陰陽合曆，你過你的年，我過我的年。」倒很有意思，於一切矛盾複雜的現象，有相當的諷刺力。但若經考據，則「公說公有理，婆說婆有理」是兩句老話。表明家庭雜處，與兩姑之間難爲婦的意思相仿，與「男女平權」並無聯屬關係，只可認爲借用。</p>
<p>在一切各項之外，有極普遍代表舊時代國民性之聯語，以「忠厚和平」爲公同依奉之標準，如「忠厚留有餘地步」「和平養無限天機，」「忠厚傳家遠」，「詩書繼世長」，「傳家有道惟存厚」「處世無奇但率真」。許多人家用雅麗的書法，刻在大門，硃地黑字精漆，每到新年，只洗刷加漆一遍，因爲沒有時間性，却有永久的表徵性。善於采風問俗的人，即此可知中華民族，是眞正愛好和平的民族，處於物競天擇的世界，固然常吃眼前虧，但愛好和平的眞誠表現，比標榜和平而實在濫用强權如大戰時之德國日本，究屬此善於彼，這一層，我們須要確切自信。但處於現代日新月異的世界潮流，僅豐傳統的道德觀念，不足應付，亦是事實。因之那些舊聯，自有更新之必要</p>
<p>近幾年的春聯，壁壘一新，所構成的要素，可以兩語該括，即「對聯標語化」「標語對聯化」。</p>
<p>對聯何以需要標語化？因爲舊式聯詞雖亦右寓意，有作風，但沿用已久，暮氣沉沉，不能應合新時代的需要，則爲切合時事，提醒國民起見，不能不採取標語式。那就是明爽的詞義，簡當而有力的句法，使大衆觸目驚心，發生振奮强幹的實效。自五四運動以來，一切新的推動，文化，政治，外交，國際地位之進步，大半得力於標語宣傳。春聯旣是自古迄今千門萬戶，異地同風，萬目具瞻的東西，利用宣傳，可謂便利無比，則使之標語化，確是因勢乘便之一法。</p>
<p>標語何以需要對聯化？標語是散句，縱極有力，能動目，能刺戰神經，而過時即逝，不易流傳衆口。故如要發生深刻而普遍的印象，則偶文韻語，最富於優越之功能，尤其是漢文，體方音單，組織最便。文心雕能說：「造化賦形，取體必雙，神理爲用，事不孤立。心生文辭，遝裁百慮，高下相須，自然成對。」人身之耳目四肢，左右分張，禽鳥之兩翼與足，獸之四蹄，亦各成對，乃至建築製造各物，歷歷可徵。中國文學雖有古文，駢文之別，然所謂散文中句子，亦往往成雙。雕龍舉　陶贊之「罪疑惟輕，功疑惟重，」益陳謨之「滿招損謙受益。」說一「豈營　詞，率然對爾」，並非專心對偶，而自然成爲對偶。古文如是，現代文更不乏其例。如今公私各機關禮堂，皆懸總理遺像，左右有「革命尙未成功」，「同志仍須努力」，即是一副對聯。在總理當年發此兩句訓言，原不爲作對聯，即懸像禮拜者，最初亦未必爲找副對聯懸掛。然而此兩言恰各六字，而且虛實相對，音調相協，正所謂不期而爲。且又不約而同。則古賢所謂豈營　調，自然成對，眞是一點不錯</p>
<p>現在每到新年，全國各處無不有應時合用的春聯。即喜慶或追悼，或紀念的禮堂上，亦有許多對聯。此外，大會場上儘管標語百出，横七豎八，可是人人心目中感覺正中高台上總要有副整齊的對聯纔好。標語寫成對聯式，記誦者一定比散誤多，可以測驗而知。</p>
<p>於是「對聯標語化」，「標語對聯化」，便成爲劃時代的文學紀錄。中國文字之特　由新的運用而益顯，同時，現代俊傑驚醒大衆之熱情，亦由此文字組織而特效。此之謂「相得益彰」。</p>

<h3>The New Min Battle Reaches its Climax; National Army Recaptures Laobian and Santaizi in Western Shenyang; Zheng Dongguo and Luo Zekai Arrive in Beiping from Guling</h3>
<p>[Our Beiping Dispatch on the 25th] The battle in Xinmin reached its climax on the 24th, becoming particularly fierce at night. The defending forces concentrated all their efforts to fight back, holding on to key strongholds. As of the 25th, the sound of artillery fire and aerial bombardment from both sides filled the air, resulting in a chaotic battle. Foreign news reports stating that the defending forces in Xinmin had retreated are premature, but the situation is indeed critical. The battle in the Juliu River area is extremely fierce. It is reported that the main force of the defending army has retreated, with the rearguard troops still fighting hard. The air force is heavily bombing the area between Juliu River and Xinmin to prevent the advance of the communist bandits. Furthermore, there have been continuous battles north of Xinglongdian since the 24th, where the communist bandits are attempting to contain the defending forces and hinder the National Army from reinforcing Xinmin.</p>
<p>[Our Shenyang Dispatch on the 25th] The National Army in Western Liaoning recovered Laobian and Santaizi, located 30 kilometers from Shenyang, on the night of the 24th, severely打击ing scattered bandits fleeing west. The bandits retreated by midnight, and the sound of artillery fire subsided. Moreover, in the north at Kaiyuan and in the south at Yingkou, the bandits only attempted probing attacks, without any major actions.</p>
<p>[Our Shenyang Dispatch on the 25th] The fighting in Xinmin has subsided slightly, with both sides currently redeploying. The 9th Column of the communist bandits from Goubangzi has also arrived near Xinmin, and the bandit forces are continuing to increase, preparing to attack again. The National Army will launch a strong counterattack against this offensive.</p>
<p>[Our Guling Dispatch on the 25th] After reporting on the military situation in the Northeast to Chairman Chiang in Guling, Zheng Dongguo left Guling for Beiping on the 25th.</p>
<p>[Our Beiping Dispatch on the 25th] Zheng Dongguo, accompanied by Luo Zekai, Director of the Third Department of the Ministry of National Defense, arrived in Beiping by plane at 4:00 PM on the 25th. It is rumored that Luo has been dispatched to the Northeast as a supervisor of the war effort. After disembarking, Zheng and Luo went to the Ministry of National Defense guesthouse in Taiping Hutong for a short rest, and then visited Li Zongren. Li Zongren, Fu Zuoyi, Zheng Dongguo, Fan Hanjie and others held an important meeting that evening. In addition to Zheng relaying instructions from the highest authorities, the participating leaders also discussed in detail issues such as North China's support for the Northeast and opening up the Beining Railway. After completing this mission, Zheng and Luo will fly to Shenyang. After a brief stop in Shenyang, Zheng will go to the Qinhuangdao, Yuguan, and Jinzhou areas to deploy military forces. Zheng has already discussed handover matters for the First Army Corps with Fan Hanjie in Beiping today. It is understood that the responsibilities of Zheng and Fan have been divided: Zheng is responsible for field operations along the Beining Line, while Fan is responsible for suppressing small groups of scattered bandits in the border areas of Hebei, Jehol and Liaoning.</p>
<p>[Our Beiping Dispatch on the 25th] Since arriving in Beiping, Xiong Shihui has been in frequent contact with military and political leaders in North China. Li Zongren, Fu Zuoyi, and Fan Hanjie have visited Xiong frequently. It is generally speculated that Xiong's trip north from Guling may be to convey the Chairman's views and inspect the overall situation in the North. Li Zongren visited Xiong again this morning at 10:00 AM, talking for half an hour.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch on the 25th] Deng Wenyi, Director of the News Bureau of the Ministry of National Defense, reported on military affairs at the Central Political Committee meeting on the 25th. He stated regarding the situation in the Northeast that the government is determined to hold Shenyang with all its strength. Reinforcements will be airlifted to Shenyang immediately, and the situation can thus be stabilized. (The "Analysis of the Recent War Situation" released by the News Bureau of the Ministry of National Defense is published on the left corner of the second page.)</p>
<h3>The Chairman Postpones His Return to Nanjing; No Important Military Conference Held in Guling</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch on the 25th] At today's press conference of the Executive Yuan's News Bureau, someone asked Director Dong: (1) What activities is Chairman Chiang engaged in while in Guling? Who has he met with? (2) It is rumored that Chairman Chiang has convened multiple military conferences with senior officials in Guling. Is this news accurate? If so, who attended the meetings? What was the nature of the meetings? Director Dong replied: Although Guling is a summer capital, the winter scenery after the snow is also particularly beautiful. The various activities of the Chairman since arriving in Guling have been regularly reported by various newspapers. Due to the completeness of modern transportation, the Chairman can handle national affairs in Guling as conveniently as in Nanjing. Several government officials, such as Wang Lingji, Chairman of the Jiangxi Provincial Government, and Guo Jian, Commander-in-Chief of the Combined Services, have visited Guling to pay their respects to the Chairman and make reports. To the best of my knowledge, the Chairman has not convened any important military conferences in Guling.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Guling, 25th] According to reports: The Chairman and his wife will not return to Nanjing for the time being in the short term.</p>
<p>[Our Guling Dispatch on the 25th] The weather in the mountains on the 25th was clear and sunny. Chairman Chiang received guests both in the morning and afternoon.</p>
<h3>All Yellow River Ferries in Western Shandong Under National Army Control; Weishi and Yanling in Eastern Henan Recaptured</h3>
<p>[Our Xuzhou Dispatch on the 25th] The National Army in Western Shandong is bravely pursuing and剿剿ing the bandits. Yesterday, they successively entered and occupied strongholds such as Linpuji and Dongkou on the south bank of the Yellow River. As of now, all the ferries on the south bank of the Yellow River in Western Shandong are under the control of the National Army, cutting off the bandits north and south of the Yellow River and severing the supply lines of the Chen and Liu bandit gangs in the Central Plains. It is estimated that more than 400 bandits were killed, and more than five heavy and light machine guns, and more than 200 rifles were seized, and more than 60 bandit ships were sunk. The Chen bandit gang remaining in the area north of Yuncheng is extremely panicked, and a part of the bandits from Kaocheng fled to Dongming yesterday.</p>
<p>[Another Dispatch] Chen Yi's 10th Column and part of the 8th Column of the bandit gang, as well as Liu's 11th Column, which had fled south on the border between Henan and Anhui, fled to Jieshou and Huaiyang yesterday, and the National Army is still pursuing them closely.</p>
<p>[Our Bengbu Dispatch on the 25th] More than 10,000 remnants of Chen Yi's bandit gang, who suddenly窜 to Sanpu, west of Suxian from the area between Yongtai, have a look of attacking eastwards. The defending army stationed in Su is deploying a blockade rate.

<h3>Bandit Army Burns, Kills, and Robs Within the Boundaries of Baoying in Northern Jiangsu</h3>
<p>Huaiyin National Army Advances Day and Night to Suppress the Bandits</p>
<p>[Our Zhenjiang Dispatch on the 15th] According to an official announcement here: Bandit gangs of the 11th and 12th Columns, numbering approximately several thousand,窜 to Tianpingzhuang, Taolin, Miaolin and other places east of Baoying on the 21st, searching and robbing civilian doors, wooden ladders, pork, chickens, and ducks. On the evening of the 22nd, they divided into groups and launched sneak attacks on Pingqiao, Jinghe, Huangpu and other places north of Baoying, as well as Fanshui Town, south of Baoying. Fanshui Town was once節陷 on the evening of the 23rd, after which they wantonly burned, killed, robbed property, and fled east. Currently, more than 300 bandits, local bandits, and militiamen are still continuing to loot in Huai. On the 24th, the bandits attempted to disturb Baoying County again. The elite troops of the National Army in Huaiyin have advanced day and night to the south to provide assistance. They have now established contact with the defending army in Baoying.

Taojiachang in Hanshan and Zha in Tongcheng have been骚扰, and bandits have also骚扰 near Tangjiagou in Tongcheng. The situation in the counties south of the Yangtze River has recently improved due to the suppression by a certain division. In Jing County, where the bandit troubles were most severe, the original twenty townships controlled by the bandits have now all been recovered. Public order in Langxi is also good, with only Guangde still awaiting suppression.</p>
<h3>Liu Duoquan Sends Personnel to Beiping to Urge Fan Hanjie to Assume His New Post Early</h3>

<h3>The Central Political Committee Held a Routine Meeting Yesterday</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch on the 25th] The Central Political Committee of the Kuomintang held a routine meeting at 9:00 AM on the 25th.

<h3>Mobile Steel Bunkers</h3>

<p>[Our Jinan Dispatch on the 25th] To strengthen the defenses along the railway line and save the people's resources, the Ministry of National Defense has recently manufactured a mobile steel bunker, which is installed on both sides of the railway.

It can also be moved at any time, and the height can be increased or decreased depending on the needs and terrain. Many of these steel bunkers have now arrived in the central section of the Jinpu Railway.</p>
<h3>The Situation is Renewed, and the Morale of the Military is Stabilized; The Situation in the Northeast Can Be Reversed; A Certain Dignitary in Beiping Discusses the Current Situation in the Northeast</h3>
<p>[Our Beiping Dispatch on the 25th] A certain dignitary involved in the highest political circles received reporters in Beiping today with a relaxed mood. He observed the current situation in the Northeast from the perspective of an "experienced person" and used playing mahjong as an analogy, saying: "The military setbacks in the Northeast over the past six months are not due to the strength of the communist bandits or the weakness of the National Army, but because we played several wrong cards in a row, which allowed the next player to 'win'." He said, "Now the situation in the Northeast is renewed, and the morale of the military is stabilized. If we can boost morale again and not be greedy for big hands, but continuously make some small 'wins,' we can slowly turn the situation around." He believes that military morale is more important than the number of troops. Currently, the number of troops in the Northeast is not too small, and the New First Army and the New Sixth Army are particularly strong and available. He is unwilling to lightly estimate the role that the re-employment of veteran generals in the Northeast can play at present. He emphasized the importance of opening up the Beining Railway, while Yingkou has little value in terms of supplies because it can only dock ships of two or three thousand tons.</p>
<h3>The Saying that Intellectuals and the Government Are Estranged is Incorrect; Dong XianGuang's Clarification of Ambassador Stuart's Remarks</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch on the 25th] At the press conference held by the Executive Yuan News Bureau at 3:30 PM on the 25th, someone asked Director Dong: "Ambassador Stuart once said that if Chinese intellectuals could establish progressive groups to stimulate government decision-making, peace could be enhanced. What are your comments on this? Is it true that there is a deep gap between the Chinese government and intellectuals?" Director Dong replied: "Ambassador Stuart is deeply aware of the situation in our country's education circles, and I am impressed. However, Ambassador Stuart's statement that Chinese intellectuals cannot cooperate with the government seems to be an overstatement. Our country, like other countries, may have some intellectuals who, emotionally, cannot sympathize with the government's measures. Most of them may take a critical attitude towards any government. Is this not a manifestation of what 　Bernard Shaw called the 'Professional Against' temperament? The government is very pleased that there are such outspoken people in our intellectual circles, because this is a manifestation of the sound development of thought, which can provide the government with a yardstick for measuring political achievements at any time. However, it would be an exaggeration to infer from this that the majority of Chinese intellectuals oppose the government. There is still no such sign to be found. If it is said that China has turned to the left because Chinese university students take the same attitude as university students in other countries, pointing out problems and being dissatisfied with the status quo, the argument is far-fetched and lacks evidence. It is similar to saying that the United States has completely turned to Marxism because there is a Harvard Socialist Association at Harvard University. In fact, the majority of Chinese intellectuals are sincerely cooperating with the government. The reason why their words and deeds are rarely reported in newspapers is that they are unwilling to waste time engaging in self-promotion. However, this does not diminish their value as pillars of our government. I would like to assure you that intellectuals will continue to cooperate with the government, because they know that only under the rule of the National Government can they obtain survival and freedom, and then seek political and economic reform. If the National Government unfortunately fails, China will lose its independence, and the hope of consolidating a democratic polity will be impossible to realize."</p>
<h3>Li TieZheng Arrives in Nanjing</h3>
<p>Immediately Pays Respects to Foreign Minister Wang and Others to Report on the Political Situation in Siam and the Situation of Overseas Chinese</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch on the 25th] Li TieZheng, our ambassador to Siam, left Bangkok to return to the country to report on his duties. He flew back to the capital via Hong Kong at 1:30 PM on the 25th, and immediately went to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to discuss the political situation in Siam, the situation of the people, and the recent situation of overseas Chinese in great detail with Foreign Minister Wang, Vice Ministers Liu and Ye, and Director of the East Asian Department Huang Zhengming, and others. According to what Li told our reporter: The purpose of his trip is to report the reasons, process, and consequences of the political changes in Siam to the government for reference. He said: The lives and property of overseas Chinese suffered little loss during the political changes in Siam. In the past three months, the new government has been quite慎重 in handling foreign relations. Regarding the education of overseas Chinese, we insist that the bilateral treaty benefit, and overseas Chinese have the freedom to educate their children. Regarding the dispute over the flag hanging in overseas Chinese schools, our overseas Chinese side has stated that our national flag and the Siamese flag can be raised and lowered at the same time, but Siamese newspapers have distorted the report a lot, so the dispute is still ongoing. This action is obviously unfriendly. However, the amount of Siamese rice transported to China is more than in any previous period. Li discussed the political situation in Siam and said: The small number of voters in the election is a fact, but the principals are quite fair. Currently, Khuang Aphaiwong is ordered to form a cabinet, but the Phibun faction still has the strength, and there is no harmony between the two factions. It is still 朱可 역料 whether the new cabinet can successfully emerge on the 26th. Our country's attitude towards Siam must be decided after its new government appears. Whether he will return to his post and when he will return to his post will also depend on the order and then decide his actions. As for the diplomatic situation in Bangkok, no country has taken unilateral action. The United Kingdom has the most investment and interests in Siam. The initial impact of the political changes was quite severe, but after adjustments, the situation has generally improved. Now the UK's policy towards Xun can be the same step as the Sino-US.</p>
<h3>Xu Baiyuan Speaks:</h3>
<p>The Policy on Industrial and Agricultural Loans Has Not Yet Been Decided</p>
<p>[United Hui Xin News Agency Dispatch] Xu Baiyuan, Secretary-General of the Four Joint Offices, said that although the Board of Directors of the Four Joint Offices has held meetings to carefully review how to handle industrial and mining production and agricultural loans in the future, they have not yet reached a decision stage. As for the basic principles, industrial and mining loans will be changed to purchase-on-order and entrust-production methods to increase production and help the government grasp materials, and interest will be calculated with reference to the market to avoid the ills of speculation and hoarding. The specific methods and various technical issues are being discussed by the responsible personnel. Agricultural loans are an important task this year. The loan methods, amounts, and types reported by various newspapers are premature, because the opinions put forward by the Farmers Bank of China and the Central Cooperative Treasury are only part of the preliminary plan. This office has also solicited the opinions of the responsible ministries of finance, economy, food, agriculture and forestry, and water conservancy, and is continuing to study and discuss them. No specific decision has been made yet. The formulation of the agricultural loan plan, and whether it can be approved after formulation, are all unknown.</p>
<h3>We Will Sign an Agreement with the Macao Authorities to Prevent Smuggling</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Hong Kong, 25th] A Central News Agency reporter learned from authoritative sources that preliminary negotiations for an agreement between China and Macao to curb smuggling and the flight of capital through Macao are expected to be held within a few days. These negotiations will be conducted by Roger, the British consultant of the Central Bank, and Yu Yingdong, the representative of the Central Bank's branch here, and Reiliff, a Portuguese official of the Macao government. Roger, who recently represented China in negotiating an agreement with Hong Kong to prevent smuggling, arrived here from Shanghai on the 23rd and will go to Macao with Yu. It is also learned that the Sino-Hong Kong Anti-Smuggling Agreement, which is currently partially effective, will not be effective without a Sino-Macao agreement of the same nature, because Macao and Hong Kong are both smuggling centers.</p>
<p>[Our Guangzhou Dispatch on the 25th] According to Hong Kong, Roger, the consultant of the Central Bank, recently arrived in Hong Kong from Shanghai, and will go to Macao on the 26th with Yu Yingjie, the representative stationed in Hong Kong, to discuss the Sino-Macao anti-smuggling agreement with the Governor of Macao to completely eliminate smuggling in South China.</p>
<h3>Absorbing Overseas Chinese Capital to Develop Industry: The Guangdong Provincial Assembly Recommends Measures</h3>
<p>[Our Guangzhou Dispatch on the 25th] The Guangdong Provincial Assembly recently recommended five measures to the government to attract overseas Chinese capital to develop industry: (A) Quickly eliminate bandits and traitors so that the lives and property of overseas Chinese are not threatened; (B) Local officials who fail to protect returning overseas Chinese in various places should be punished and held responsible for compensation; (C) Local overseas Chinese leaders should be mobilized by the provincial councillors of each province to form overseas Chinese industrial construction companies within a short period of time, using the manufacture of light industrial products and people's livelihood products as the standard, and special attention should be paid to the use of local raw materials; (D) Develop industrial investment, with overseas Chinese as the main body, and the government provides assistance and various preferential treatments and guarantees; (E) The provincial government formulates various measures to encourage overseas Chinese investment.</p>
<h3>Guangdong Resource Development Plan: Sun Yueqi Decides in Guangzhou</h3>
<p>[Our Guangzhou Dispatch on the 25th] The Guangdong economic construction project is being actively promoted. Sun Yueqi recently arrived here to inspect it, and has made decisions on several resource development plans. It is reported that the Nanling Company, which is jointly formed by the Asset Committee and the two provinces of Guangdong and Hunan, is currently mining the two major coal mines in Baziling Gouyadong on the border between Guangdong and Hunan. Zhang Boyan, the manager of the company, is planning to speed up the Gouyadong branch line of the Yuehan Railway, with a budget of 150 billion yuan. Steel rails, etc. have also been purchased and prepared, and construction can begin in the short term. Regarding the relocation of several domestic factories to Guangdong, according to Jianlu's aspects, they once made this request to Song Ziwen, but what kind of factory it belongs to is unknown</p>
<h3>More Than a Hundred American Businesses Have Been Approved to Set Up in Guangzhou</h3>
<p>[Our Guangzhou Dispatch on the 25th] More than 200 American businesses in Huicheng have applied for registration with the China South Import and Export Branch. According to news from the association, more than 100 have been approved. These American businesses are currently located in various parts of South China, and have now been approved to set up in Guangzhou.</p>
<h3>The Democratic League Elements in Hong Kong Publicly Declare Rebellion</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Hong Kong, 25th] According to reports, since the "Democratic League" announced its automatic dissolution on November 5 last year, branches in various parts of the country have ceased activities. Most of the members of the League have seen through the conspiracy of the communist bandits and have broken away from the relationship. The chairman of the League, Zhang Lan, and the responsible personnel of its headquarters, such as Shi Longji, Huang Yanpei, and Liang Shuming, are still living in Nanjing, Shanghai, and Chongqing, while Zhang Bojun, Shen Junru, and others have secretly gone to Hong Kong and merged with the original Southern General Branch, denying the dissolution order of the headquarters and secretly plotting to reorganize the organization, maintaining regular contact with the communist bandits in Hong Kong. It was finally decided to restore the headquarters, intensify illegal activities, and convene the Third Plenary Session last month. Due to internal disagreements and prolonged disputes, the meeting lasted for two weeks and did not end until the 19th of last month. In particular, the liquidation of Huang Yanpei, Liang Shuming, and others aroused fierce debate, but in the end it was completely controlled by the communist bandits. The content of its political report and original declaration was very激烈, and its recent activities in all aspects have further confirmed that its rebellious actions are completely in line with what it has declared.</p>
<h3>Badger Takes Office</h3>
<p>General Kirk Returns to the United States Today, Gui Yongqing Arrives in Nanjing from Qingdao</p>
<p>[United News Agency, Qingdao, 25th] The newly appointed Commander of the U.S. Western Pacific Fleet, Badger, officially took office on the stern deck of the flagship USS Estes today. The ceremony was simple. U.S. Navy officers and soldiers and senior Chinese military officers were all present to observe the ceremony, and the seal was handed over by the former commander, Kirk. Kirk's four-star flag was immediately removed from the flagpole and replaced with Badger's three-star flag, and the handover ceremony ended. Kirk shook hands with Badger and others one by one and left the ship, and is scheduled to return to the country tomorrow on the transport ship Baffiel. The territory of the Western Pacific Fleet includes the Pacific region west of the Mariana Islands. With this command located less than 300 air miles from Lushun, occupied by the Soviet Union, important figures in China and the United States believe that it is essential for the United States to maintain a naval presence in Qingdao if the Soviet army concentrates in these two ports. A fleet patrolling the 300-mile sea between the Chinese mainland and Korea can effectively intercept any naval vessels north of the Yellow Sea. Badger served on the Joint Chiefs of Staff during the war, and was intelligent and brave. He led troops in attacking Okinawa and the Japanese mainland.</p>

<h3>The Legislative Yuan's Five Committees Continue Reviewing: Budget Figures Unchanged; Reconsider Public Offering and Subsidy Policies</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 25th] The Legislative Yuan's Finance, Economics, Legal System, Foreign Affairs, and Military Affairs Committees held a joint session on the morning of the 25th to continue reviewing the general budget proposal. They amended and approved the "Report Outline on the Review of the Draft General Budget of Central Government Revenue and Expenditure for the First Half of the 37th Year," making no changes to the various figures listed in the budget proposal. They only offered opinions, which will be discussed and passed at the Legislative Yuan meeting on the 28th before being sent to the Executive Yuan. The outline first points out that the budget expenditure is enormous, and with rising prices, the deficit will inevitably increase further, which cannot be fully covered by issuance and foreign debt alone. Secondly, it frankly points out that the budget is a matter of "perfunctory compliance" for national use and "lacks a fundamental reform plan." Its recommendations are divided into three parts, with the following key points:</p>
<p>(1) Revenue section: 1. The surplus or sale revenue of various state-run banks and other banks with official shares managed by the Ministry of Finance, as well as agricultural, forestry, and animal husbandry agencies managed by the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry, and the remaining U.S. military and Lend-Lease materials, enemy and puppet-received materials, and Japanese reparations materials, should all be realistically increased. 2. The tax collection agencies managed by the Ministry of Finance and the agencies handling the remaining U.S. military and Lend-Lease materials, enemy and puppet-received materials, and Japanese reparations materials should all be thoroughly reorganized to eliminate malpractices and enrich the treasury. 3. The government should earnestly find ways to make those with money contribute, in accordance with the principle of taxation based on ability to pay.</p>
<p>(2) Expenditure section: 1. Agencies established through legislative procedures and redundant agencies should be reviewed and abolished to save costs. 2. The commercial and tax agencies under the Ministry of Finance and the organization of the Ministry of National Defense should be simplified to reduce waste. 3. Education funds should be listed in full according to the Constitution, accounting for 15% of the total budget.</p>
<p>(3) Other sections: 1. State-owned enterprises should hire experts to thoroughly verify their assets and profits and losses to facilitate reorganization and enrich the treasury, and they should each prepare operating budgets for review by the Legislative Yuan. 2. Public offering [of currency or bonds] should dispel public doubts and anxieties to stabilize currency value and curb prices. 3. After the cancellation of subsidy policies, state-owned enterprises are leading the rise in prices. The multiple of price increases in the past year has been even more severe than in the past. The subsidy policy needs to be reconsidered.</p>
<h3>Soviet Government Formally Announces: Roshchin Appointed as Ambassador to China; Petrov Relieved of Duty Due to Illness</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Moscow, 25th] The Soviet government announced today that Ambassador to China Petrov has been relieved of his duties due to illness and will be succeeded by Major General Roshchin. The Soviet government expressed its intention to transfer the ambassador to our government on the 13th of this month and sought our consent. Our government expressed its acceptance five days later. The new ambassador was originally the military attaché at the Soviet Embassy in Nanjing and has been in China for a long time.</p>
<p>[United Press, Nanjing, 25th] An official spokesperson today indirectly confirmed the news that the Soviet Union has sought China's consent to appoint military expert Semyon Roshchin as Ambassador to China. When asked if the report that Moscow recommended Roshchin to the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs was true, the spokesperson replied that it was difficult to comment. Observers here believe that the official spokesperson's failure to deny this is tantamount to indirect confirmation. Roshchin has been in China for over eight years, and during the war, he served as the military attaché at the Soviet Embassy, stationed in Chongqing. According to those around him, Roshchin "took leave to return home" several weeks ago, while current Ambassador Petrov is in the Soviet Union for "consultations."</p>

<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 25th] According to reliable sources, an important meeting was held at Premier Zhang Qun's residence on the morning of the 25th. Besides Zhang himself, only Zhang Jia'ao and Wang Shijie participated. This meeting was convened by Zhang Qun while he was slightly indisposed.

He left before the meeting ended and arrived at Zhang's residence around 10:00 AM. The three met for over two hours, dispersing at 12:00 PM. In the afternoon, Zhang Jia'ao revisited Ambassador Stuart, remaining in conversation for fifty minutes. The content of the two conversations held this morning and afternoon was not revealed, but it is widely believed to be related to the U.S. aid issue. The fact that Zhang Qun, while slightly indisposed, still convened Zhang and Wang for a two-hour meeting further highlights its importance.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 25th] Foreign Minister Wang reported on foreign affairs at the KMT Central Political Committee meeting on the 25th, covering (1) the progress and results of U.S. aid, (2) the determination of Japan's industrial level, and (3) our attitude towards the North Korean issue.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 25th] According to the Ministry of Food, from January to June of this year, China can obtain an international aid rice quota of 200,045 tons. From July of last year to June of this year, an estimated wheat quota of 300,000 tons can be obtained. This quota will be allocated monthly by the supplying countries, and the grain-purchasing countries will gradually purchase it. In the above-mentioned rice and wheat quotas for our country, a portion will be allocated to the U.S. government, which will use relief funds to purchase and transport it to China, matching an equivalent amount of grain from our government for distribution in five cities. The government's own purchases are mostly allocated as soon as they arrive, so there is no risk of spoilage.</p>
<p>[Our Guangzhou Dispatch, 25th] Regarding the use of $50 million from the U.S. aid funds to assist the Yuehan Railway, it is learned that the authorities have decided to use most of the funds to build a large-scale machinery factory in Xicun, Guangzhou, to supply the Yuehan Railway's required materials and improve the driving equipment.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 24th] The U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee held a regular meeting today and did not discuss the aid to China plan. A spokesperson for the committee told the Central News Agency that although the Senate has formally sent President Truman's aid to China plan to the Foreign Relations Committee for discussion, the committee has not yet heard opinions from all parties on the matter.</p>

<h3>U.S. Aid and Self-Help</h3>
<p>— Cheng Tianfang</p>
<p>The long-awaited U.S. aid to China bill was finally submitted to the U.S. Congress by President Truman in a special message on the 18th of this month. The message stated that the United States has continuously supported the National Government for twenty years since its establishment. The United States has provided China with a large amount of assistance during the war against Japan and after Japan's surrender. The reason is that "the people of China and the United States have many years of sincere friendship, long-standing commercial and cultural ties, and close cooperation. The people of the United States have always admired the people of China and sympathize with the various tests and difficulties they have encountered. The United States has long recognized that China's stability is extremely important to lasting peace in the Pacific and the world. China has become an important factor in international relations due to its large land and population. China has excellent traditions and culture, and a large and energetic population. We sincerely hope that China will be strong and advanced so that it can make full contributions to the strengthening of international forces." The specific measures proposed are to request Congress to approve US$570 million as aid to China before June 30, 1949. This amount can be a loan or a gift. Of this amount, US$510 million will be used to purchase the goods most needed by China, such as wheat, rice, cotton, petroleum and petroleum products, fertilizers, tobacco, drugs, non-ferrous metals, and steel products, as well as machine parts. US$60 million will be used to fund large-scale industries, such as the Shanghai Power Company, the Yuehan Railway, the Ganxi and Hunan Xiangtan coal mines, and may include sugar mills, fertilizer plants, cement plants, and wharf equipment in Taiwan. In summary, this U.S. aid is in the form of materials rather than cash, and it will be delivered in installments rather than in a lump sum. Its purpose is to "give the Chinese government time to breathe in the economic recession so that it can find ways to establish a more stable economic situation." Therefore, the condition of U.S. aid is that the Chinese government must guarantee to the United States that "it will take practical economic, financial, and other measures to achieve the goal of economic stability and recovery." If the United States believes that the Chinese government has not fulfilled this guarantee, it can stop this assistance at any time.</p>
<p>Two days after President Truman's message was submitted, Secretary of State Marshall testified when the House Foreign Affairs Committee discussed the aid to China plan. He first read a prepared speech, and then answered questions from the members of the committee, and presented documents on the economic aid to China plan. From these speeches, questions and answers, and documents, we can better understand the U.S. government's current China policy. Although General Marshall admitted that China is currently in serious difficulties and needs assistance, and the United States will provide assistance, he emphasized that "the Chinese problem must be solved by the Chinese people themselves... The aid to China plan should not include actual guarantees of China's economic future, and the United States should not take actions that would directly make it responsible for the actions of the Chinese government and its political, economic, and military aspects." In his speech and answers, General Marshall strictly criticized China's political and military situation, believing that the Chinese government had not accepted his constant suggestions during his year in China to improve political and military matters, resulting in the current serious situation. He also believes that aid to China is different from aid to Europe, because "European countries have a sound foundation for advice, but the situation in China is chaotic and no one can predict the future." Therefore, if Congress cannot solve these two matters at the same time, it should devote all its energy to first pass the aid to Europe bill, and then discuss aid to China. He further hinted that the United States is not prepared to assist China in reforming its currency system, because this requires a lot of funds, and most of these funds will be wasted at a time when China's civil war is underway. He pointed out that the communist army has caused terrible destruction to achieve the party's publicly announced goal of promoting the collapse of China's economy. On the one hand, he admitted that the provinces north of the Yangtze River may fall into the hands of the communists, but strangely, he also said that there is no evidence that the Chinese communist army has received foreign aid.</p>
<p>After the aid to China bill was submitted, people from all walks of life in the United States have been discussing this issue fiercely for the past week. The opinions from all parties can be roughly divided into four factions: One faction is the American Communist Party and its fellow travelers, such as the Far Eastern Democratic Policy Committee, and those who, although not such figures, unknowingly serve as tools of the Communist Party, such as Mr. Wallace and the Progressive Citizens of America he leads. They believe that the Chinese Communist Party is a democratic and progressive party, while the National Government is stubborn and reactionary, and a dictatorial government. They are willing to see the collapse of the National Government and the success of the Chinese Communist Party. Their mentality is that it is best for the United States to make a 180-degree turn, aid the CCP, and overthrow the government. If this cannot be done, at least the United States should adopt a Hands-off Policy and let China sort itself out. Therefore, they adopt a resolutely opposed attitude towards any aid to China plan. However, this part of the population is really insignificant in the total population of the United States, and their views will not have much impact. Another faction includes Republican members of Congress, such as Senators Vandenberg, Taft, Speaker of the House Martin, Representatives Eaton, Judd, Smith, and many other gentlemen, as well as the newspapers of the Scripps Howard system. They support the aid to China bill, but express dissatisfaction: because the amount of aid is too small, and it is limited to economic aid, without including military and financial assistance, and it is delayed until next June to pay it off, I am afraid there is a danger of it being too late. The third faction can be represented by powerful newspapers such as the New York Times and the Herald Tribune. They support this bill, but adopt a prudent tone, believing that whether aid to China will be effective depends on China's own efforts. The fourth faction is another group of powerful newspapers, such as the Washington Post, the Baltimore Sun, and the Christian Science Monitor. They are anti-communist, but they do not support aiding China at this time; because they are too disappointed in China, believing that before China's political and economic systems are greatly reformed, aiding China is like throwing money into a bottomless pit.</p>
<p>What are our feelings when we look at this U.S. aid from the perspective of Chinese people? In terms of the spirit of the aid to China bill, we are sincerely grateful for the goodwill of our allies in helping China overcome economic difficulties, especially President Truman's message, which is filled with sympathy and friendship for the Chinese people. This kind of sympathy and friendship is worthy of our cherishing. After the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, the CCP, the American Communist Party, and their fellow travelers have continuously engaged in instigating discord between China and the United States. As long as the relationship between the people of China and the United States becomes more and more estranged, and the friendship becomes weaker and weaker, the international communist ambitions in East Asia will be easier to realize. After reading President Truman's message, we know that the Communist Party's conspiracy has not succeeded in this regard, which makes us feel deeply gratified. However, in terms of the content of the aid to China bill, we feel that we cannot be completely satisfied. I believe that U.S. aid to China to eliminate the communist disaster and make China a stabilizing force for peace in the Far East requires both spiritual encouragement and substantial support. Substantial support can be divided into military, financial, and economic categories. These three types of assistance complement each other and are indispensable. Now, only economic aid is included in the aid to China bill, and military and financial assistance are both absent, which is a major flaw. As Mr. Judd said, a tripod needs three legs to support it. Now, only one leg has been installed, how can it stand firmly? Of course, the influx of US$570 million in materials into China will naturally have a considerable benefit to China's national economy, but this is only a kind of Relief, not a Cure, and it cannot cure China's serious disease. Because if the military situation cannot improve and the runaway inflation cannot be curbed by reforming the currency system, then the serious economic crisis, even if it is temporarily alleviated, will still occur soon. Some people hope to use this U.S. aid properly to stop inflation and stabilize prices. We only need to look at the fact that prices have soared in the week since the aid to China bill came out to know that this view seems too optimistic.</p>
<p>What is especially surprising is that General Marshall, a military strategist and politician, who now bears a major responsibility in world politics, still seems to have an incomplete understanding of the situation in China. He said that the Chinese problem must be solved by the Chinese people themselves, and also said that there is no evidence that the CCP has received foreign aid. Judging from these words, it is easy to believe that General Marshall's view is that the CCP is only an internal problem of China, not part of a world problem. If General Marshall holds this view, it is really a pity! Indeed, the CCP is so rampant because of the poor Chinese politics, which has done a lot of work to drive the birds to the forest. However, the CCP itself is undoubtedly a link in world communism, and the problems it causes are part of the world problem, and are by no means a simple domestic problem of China. How to solve the CCP problem will quickly affect the peace of the entire world. This is not only the same in nature as the Greek problem, but also has a much greater impact than the Greek problem. As for saying that the CCP has not received foreign aid, that is even more of a self-deceiving joke! We only need to ask: Why can Li Lisan run back to the Northeast from Moscow to be the leader of the Northeast Communist Party? Why was the communist army allowed to enter the Northeast in a steady stream during the period of Soviet military occupation? Why did the Japanese Kwantung Army's armaments fall into the hands of the communist army? Why are there Korean communists with well-equipped weapons participating in the war in the Northeast communist army today? After thinking about these questions, anyone will find the answer themselves.</p>
<p>There are still some people in the United States who believe that communism is a problem of thought and life. We must deal with it in terms of thought and life, and we cannot eliminate communism by force. Therefore, they oppose the Chinese government's use of force against the Communist Party, and they also oppose the use of military force to aid China. These people are really a bit bookish, knowing one but not the other. We admit that all ideologies and all thoughts cannot be eliminated by force. The inability of force to eliminate communism is just like the inability of force to eliminate fascism and Nazism. We want to eliminate these totalitarian ideas that are different on the surface but the same in substance. We can only use educational methods to cultivate sound human thoughts, and at the same time use economic transformation methods to enable humans to obtain happiness in clothing, food, housing, and transportation. All deviant ideas will naturally not be blindly followed. However, dealing with the Chinese Communist Party, which has hundreds of thousands of troops and is rebelling, is different from dealing with simple communism. We cannot eliminate ideology by force, but at the same time, we must never eliminate the rebellious force that has already formed by thought and life alone. China today cannot but use force to eliminate the Communist Party, just as President Lincoln could not but use force during the American Civil War, and as the Allied countries could not but use force to defeat Germany and Japan during World War II. If President Lincoln did not use force, the United States would not have become a unified democratic republic. If the Allied countries could not defeat Germany and Japan, the entire world would be conquered by Germany and Japan: If China does not eliminate the Communist Party, the entire China will be controlled by the Communist Party!</p>
<p>Although Americans have many wrong views about China, which has affected their less active China policy, we should still try our best to reflect on ourselves and not just blame others. Since the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, we have really done many things that grieve our loved ones and please our enemies! Our political, military, financial, and economic weaknesses are really too many, so the Communist Party has an opportunity to take advantage of and develop as much as possible. What is past is past. We must start today to do the work of mending the fold after the sheep are lost in order to salvage this serious situation. We hope for assistance from others, so we must fully help ourselves. Therefore, all the shortcomings pointed out by General Marshall and others, whether they are completely correct or not, can be used as our stepping stones. In times of crisis, we must overcome all difficulties and implement thorough reforms in political, military, financial, and economic aspects. This will not only strengthen international goodwill, but also win back the hearts of the people at home. If the government can go in this direction regardless of all obstacles, I think that although the amount of U.S. aid is not enough, it can still be fully utilized and achieve considerable results. Moreover, after this material assistance, other forms of assistance may come in a steady stream, and the situation in China will gradually have hope of becoming clear. If politics, military, finance, and economy cannot be coordinated with U.S. aid to improve, and the situation is as serious as it is now, or even more serious, after June next year, then this US$570 million will be equivalent to not having any effect, and will suit the Communist Party and its fellow travelers. Whether China's future is a blessing or a disaster, whether it is maintaining peace or creating chaos for the world, a part of it depends on whether our allies have a sufficient understanding of China and whether their actions are active, but most of it still depends on our own choices!</p>

The company's giant ship "Tongping," with a deadweight of over 11,000 tons, set sail from Shanghai at around 10:00 AM on the 25th, heading directly for San Francisco. This voyage is entirely for trial purposes, so it is not carrying passengers or cargo. It is estimated to arrive in the United States in 24 days. On its return journey, it plans to stop at Manila before returning to Shanghai, carrying a large shipment of cement from San Francisco to Manila.</p>

<h3>Ancient Tree from the Dinosaur Era Transplanted from China to the United States</h3>
<p>[United States Information Service, Cambridge, Massachusetts, 24th] The New York Times recently reported that trees from the early days of Earth will soon grow in botanical gardens in the United States. It is generally believed that these trees became extinct at the same time as the last dinosaurs. The remaining seeds of this tree were discovered in a hidden valley in Central China and have now been brought to Harvard University's Arnold Arboretum. They will be planted there and in three other tree collections in the United States, as well as in two locations in the United Kingdom. This family of trees is similar to the redwood or California redwood species. Its fossils have long been known, so botanists have named it redwood based on the nature of its fossils, as this type of tree existed all over the world millions of years ago. It is said that this type of tree can grow to a height of over one hundred feet, with a trunk diameter of up to seven and a half feet. Unlike American redwood trees, it sheds its leaves every winter.</p>

<h3>Ministry of National Defense News Bureau Releases Analysis of Recent War Situation: It is Not Difficult for National Army in Northeast to Turn to a Favorable Situation</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 25th] The Ministry of National Defense News Bureau released the following full analysis of the recent war situation from February 18th to 24th on the 25th:</p>
<p>Northeast Region</p>
<p>The communist bandit activity in the Northeast is exploiting the severe cold weather to isolate Shenyang by cutting off transportation lines while Yingkou and Huludao are frozen. They rely on international support and the flexibility of rear transportation lines, fighting and retreating repeatedly, using the strategy of "the strong preying on the weak," and never engaging in head-on decisive battles. From the Jichang Campaign to the present, they have not deviated from this strategic principle. Following the Liaoyang battle, they immediately launched an attack on Anshan. Currently, from the 12th to the afternoon of the 20th, the defending forces, with only two regiments, fought repeatedly against about 100,000 communist bandits from the 2nd, 4th, 6th, 7th, 8th, and 5th columns, exacting a price three times greater than their own losses. Although the communist bandits mobilized all the artillery in southern Liaoning, concentrating over thirty heavy artillery pieces and over fifty mountain guns for concentrated bombardment, they still did not shake the morale of the defending forces. The fighting continued until the last stronghold in the steel plant was occupied before the defending forces broke out and retreated eastward with the workers.</p>
<p>Regarding the surrounding situation, because the communist bandits are extending southward to Yingkou, detouring northward to Faku, and increasing defenses westward along the Daling River at Goubangzi and Dahushan, their forces are already stretched thin. Therefore, they are increasingly feeling the pressure from the National Army on the Beining Railway. If the ice thaws completely and maritime transport is unobstructed, the communist bandits will naturally feel even more threatened. Therefore, they are eager to isolate Shenyang in the short term. However, more than three months have passed since the communist bandits launched their offensive, and Shenyang remains as strong as ever. Except for the Liaonan area, the surrounding strongholds are still standing firmly. Faku was a strategic retreat by the National Army. The communist bandits have failed to achieve their military objective of attacking Shenyang from a junction in western Liaoning and can only use methods of cutting off transportation and preventing the entry of supplies to achieve a prolonged siege. As a result of this prolonged war, it is not difficult for the National Army to seize opportunities to turn the situation to their advantage.</p>
<p>Central China Region</p>
<p>The Dabie Mountain battle in Central China has entered the mopping-up stage. The main force of Chen Yi's communist bandit troops is being pursued northward by the National Army, fleeing toward western Shandong. They did not gain a foothold in Chengwu, Caoxian, or Shanxian and were immediately ambushed by the National Army from both sides. Their original plan was to destroy the northern section of the Tianjin-Pukou Railway, but they were unable to achieve their goal due to the National Army's relentless pursuit. In addition to using the 4th and 6th columns and the Liangguang column as covering forces, the 3rd column and part of the 1st and 6th columns are stationed north and south of Minquan and Lanfeng to contain the pursuing troops. The 8th column and the 10th and 11th columns, a total of three columns, are fleeing southward, attempting to rebuild the supply line to support Liu's communist bandits. Part of them have reached the vicinity of Zhecheng, and part of them are still near Xiayi, avoiding battle and fleeing southward.</p>
<p>In summary, regarding the dynamics of the war situation inside and outside the passes, the Northeast is at a stalemate, and the National Army inside the passes is undertaking a combined military, political, and economic mopping-up campaign. The gain or loss of a city or town, or the repeated gains and losses of each location on the battlefield, is no longer the deciding factor in the war. This is what we must know when analyzing the war situation in all aspects.</p>

<h3>President Accepts Resignations of Right-Wing Cabinet Members, Czech Communist Party Forms New Cabinet, Social Democratic Party Splinter Group Participates in Cooperation</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] London, 25th broadcast: Prague dispatch, Czech Republic: President Benes has formally accepted the cabinet list submitted by Premier Gottwald. Another dispatch, according to witnesses, police opened fire on marching students today.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Prague, 25th] The government radio station announced this afternoon (approximately 7:30 PM Shanghai time) that President Benes has yielded to the demands of the Communist Party and approved the resignations of twelve anti-communist cabinet members. The new government will be formed this afternoon, largely under the control of the Communist Party.</p>
<p>[United Press, Prague, 25th] Communist Premier Gottwald, accompanied by several communist ministers, met with President Benes at 6:00 PM this afternoon to present the list of new cabinet members. Leaders of the opposition parties have acknowledged defeat, but the Catholic Church, led by Bishop Beran, has appealed to the Czech people to "restore reason, not forget responsibility, and maintain the law." The Gottwald cabinet, which replaces the former Six-Party Coalition Cabinet, will be composed of some Communist Party members willing to cooperate with the Communist Party, as well as a small number of defectors from the opposition parties. Benes is scheduled to address the nation at 8:00 PM, at which time the final decision on the new cabinet may be made. Previously, the president's statements indicated that he could only accept a new cabinet based on constitutional parliamentary rules. The Communist Party's announcement stated that the new cabinet is based on a majority of the Constituent Assembly. However, the Communist coup seems to have split the Social Democratic Party. Only one faction, led by the left-wing Fierlinger, who served as the Czech ambassador to the Soviet Union and the first premier after the war, will participate in the new cabinet. The party leadership, including Chairman Lausman and Secretary-General Vilim, sent a letter to Benes, declaring their support and stating that the president's attitude in the political crisis should be respected. The letter stated that the party's executive committee unanimously believes that the divisions that caused the crisis are not insurmountable but must be resolved based on the principles of the National Front (meaning the multi-party cabinet) in accordance with the charter. Benes' speech tonight will be his first public address to the nation in the four days since the coup.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Prague, 25th] Communist police today began arresting people involved in the so-called British and American spy conspiracy. The Prague radio station, under Communist Party control, said that those arrested were people who maintained regular contact with consuls of the two Western countries. At the same time, the Communist police and the action committees of the trade unions are rapidly strengthening their lightning-acquired powers throughout the country. Worker demonstrations are heading towards the Presidential Palace.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Prague, 25th] The Communist Party has de facto control of Czechoslovakia. The last bastion of non-Communist forces throughout troubled Czechoslovakia is President Benes alone. Constitutionally, Benes is the head of state and must avoid aligning himself with any party and is limited in his power to directly interfere with the government. Throughout the Communist "bloodless coup," Benes acted like the Supreme Court, demanding a fair resolution of the political upheaval. Since last Friday, the 63-year-old Benes has worked 18 hours a day seeking a democratic solution. His term is seven years, expiring in 1953. Although he is old, he is determined to complete his term.</p>
<h3>United States Pays Close Attention to Developments in the Czech Republic, Future Actions of the Soviet Union Are Extremely Noteworthy</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] New York, 25th broadcast: Washington dispatch, diplomatic circles predict that after the Communist Party controls Czechoslovakia, France and Italy will soon experience new difficulties incited by the Soviet Union behind the scenes. It is widely believed that Moscow will soon increase pressure on Greece, Turkey, Finland, and Iran.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Washington, 25th] US officials do not express surprise at the coup in Czechoslovakia. Since the Soviet Union sent a strongly worded letter to Czechoslovakia last summer, ordering it to change its decision to participate in the Marshall Plan, the State Department has expected that the Soviet Union would eventually seize everything in Czechoslovakia, as it has done with other Eastern European countries.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Washington, 24th] The United States reluctantly acknowledged on the 24th that the complete fall of Czechoslovakia into the hands of the Communist Party was a fait accompli. Of the Eastern European countries, only Czechoslovakia was still able to open a small window to the West and prevent the Kremlin from controlling its internal affairs. The United States is unable to provide assistance today and cannot even issue a protest. However, it is expected that the State Department will soon find a way to openly declare that the United States fully understands the illegal means by which the Czech Communists have placed the entire country under the Soviet yoke.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 24th] Well-informed international economic experts here say that if the Communist Party seizes power in Czechoslovakia, the country may lose the $350 million in loans from the World Bank. Czech foreign trade will become abnormal, and the domestic living standards will decline.</p>
<h3>Czech President,崇仰Democracy, Letter to Communist Party Released</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Prague, 25th] Czech President Benes recently sent a letter to the Communist Party leader, stating, "You know that I have a sincere belief in democracy, and I cannot abandon it at this time, because I believe that democracy is the only sound and permanent foundation for achieving a noble and honest human life. I believe that democracy cannot exist without parliamentary freedom and a parliamentary government. I fully understand the necessity of social and economic reforms within the scope of democracy. My past political life has been guided by this principle, and if I violate this principle, I will be unfaithful to my own beliefs and to the trust placed in me. Our current national crisis can only be overcome by democratic and parliamentary means. This is not to say that I intend to disregard the demands of the Communist Party. I believe that all political parties should share political responsibility."</p>
<h3>The Czechs Seal the Border with Germany with Armed Security Police Gathering</h3>
<p>[United Press International, Frankfurt, 25th] The U.S. occupation forces headquarters announced today that Czech security police, carrying firearms and pistols, have completely controlled their western border and sealed it off tightly. Under normal circumstances, only 30 police officers are stationed in Asch, but there are now at least 300, and border railway workers are also armed.</p>
<h3>Soviet Secret Agents Infiltrate Hawaii</h3>
<p>Plot to Launch a Second Pearl Harbor Incident</p>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] New York, 25th Broadcast: Quincy, Massachusetts—Massachusetts Lieutenant Governor Coolidge stated that Soviet secret agents are continuously infiltrating Hawaii to plot a new attack on Pearl Harbor, the ferocity of which will be comparable to the sneak attack made by the Japanese in 1941. Hawaii Governor Stainback has obtained various pieces of evidence, including instructions issued by the Communist Party to secret agents.</p>
<h3>US to Construct Cemetery in Memory of Pearl Harbor Attack</h3>
<p>[United Press International, Washington, 25th] The U.S. House Appropriations Committee today approved over one million dollars for the construction of a memorial cemetery near Pearl Harbor, the site of the greatest military defeat in U.S. history, to commemorate the event. The cemetery will be constructed by the Army Corps of Engineers on "Sacrifice Ridge" in Hawaii, which overlooks Pearl Harbor.</p>
<h3>Security Council Continues Debate on Holy Land Partition Plan</h3>
<p>Possible Amendments to the UN Plan</p>
<p>[Reuters, Lake Success, 25th] The Security Council is scheduled to resume its debate on the Palestine issue at 8 p.m. standard time today. Even experts on the Palestine issue cannot predict the outcome of the debate. The U.S. yesterday avoided taking a firm stance on the Palestine issue in the Security Council, implicitly suggesting to other member states that the U.S. is not willing to provide troops at this stage to implement the partition plan. If this interpretation is accurate, the representatives of China and Argentina, who will speak today, will again criticize the partition plan. The resolution temporarily proposed by Colombia during yesterday's debate effectively takes into account amendments to the UN partition plan.</p>
<h3>Benelux Nations Join London Conference to Consult on Policy Toward West Germany France Firmly Opposes German Centralization</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 24th] A spokesperson for the French Embassy stated: Discussions between the U.K., U.S., and France on the German issue are continuing in London, and no resolutions have been established. He declined to disclose further information, and no communiqué was issued after the meeting. Delegations from the Benelux countries are expected to attend the meeting on the 25th to participate in the discussion of the first item on the agenda.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Paris, 25th] It is believed here that the French delegation participating in the London Tripartite Conference will present a new defense of the method of controlling Germany that every French government since the end of the war has insisted on. However, whether this will lead to a convergence of opinions among the three powers remains to be seen. France's insistence is based on its own security, so France demands effective control of the Ruhr area by the Allied countries, and therefore firmly opposes a centralized central government in Germany or West Germany. An advisor to Foreign Minister Bidault revealed that France's official position on German policy will be as follows: France believes that Europe cannot truly recover unless Western European countries can have genuine political and economic unity, and this unity must include the participation of West Germany. However, if West Germany is a highly centralized government, the European group will inevitably be manipulated by Germany.</p>
<h3>Nordic Nations Establish Economic Committee to Study Cooperation Methods</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Oslo, 24th] The foreign ministers of Norway, Sweden, Denmark, and Iceland issued a communiqué after concluding their meeting here, declaring that the four countries have decided to participate in the Marshall Plan and the working committee to promote economic cooperation among the sixteen European countries. The four governments also recognize that the success of the Marshall Plan is of decisive importance for the recovery of Europe. The four governments share the same views on the problems that the Marshall Plan intends to solve. The communiqué further announced that the four Nordic countries have decided to establish an economic cooperation committee immediately to consider: (1) unifying the tariffs of the four Nordic countries to establish a customs union; (2) reducing tariffs and trade quantity restrictions among the four Nordic countries; (3) expanding the distribution of industrial and commercial labor and the promotion of technology among the four countries, and promoting the emergence of new industries to achieve mutual economy among the four countries; (4) extending the existing four-country commercial cooperation system.</p>
<h3>Jiang Tingfu Declares at Small Assembly: We Sincerely Hope for Korean-Soviet Cooperation, Actions That Divide North and South Korea Should Be Avoided</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Lake Success, 24th] Chinese representative Jiang Tingfu today appealed to the United Nations Korean Commission in the United Nations Small Assembly to avoid actions that would strengthen the division of North and South Korea. He also stated: The Chinese government sincerely hopes that Korea can develop friendly relations with the Soviet Union. U.S. representative Jessup expressed the U.S.'s support for holding elections in South Korea immediately to establish a national government. Jiang Tingfu said: The United Nations Korean Commission should avoid actions that would make the division between North and South Korea more concrete. We must be extra cautious when reviewing any actions. I believe that the path stipulated in the UN resolution is most conducive to promoting the independence and unification of Korea. The Chinese government will never allow the Korean national government to adopt an anti-Soviet policy. On the contrary, China sincerely hopes that Korea can develop the friendliest relations with the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>[United Press International, Lake Success, 24th] The debate on the Korean issue continued into the afternoon without any resolution, and the Small Assembly adjourned to reconvene on the morning of the 25th.</p>
<h3>Soviet Union and Burma Establish Diplomatic Relations</h3>
<p>[United Press International, Rangoon, 25th] The Burmese government today announced the establishment of diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union, and the two countries will soon establish embassies in Rangoon and Moscow.</p>
<h3>Wallace Criticizes Marshall Plan</h3>
<p>Believes It Will Eventually Lead to War</p>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 24th] After Wallace delivered his criticism of the Marshall European Recovery Program before the House Foreign Affairs Committee, he stated in response to reporters' inquiries: The Marshall Plan will complete the division of Europe and eventually lead to war.</p>
<h3>French Prime Minister Schuman Regains Parliamentary Confidence</h3>
<p>But May Trigger National Strike</p>
<p>[Reuters, Paris, 24th] The National Assembly, with a vote of 291 to 268, passed a vote supporting the government's rejection of the four to five thousand franc banknotes it received, thus giving Prime Minister Schuman his sixth vote of confidence. Subsequently, the General Confederation of Labor, controlled by the Communist Party, announced that it would soon propose a general wage increase of 50% above the level before December. The General Confederation of Labor argued that the wage standard should be based on a minimum of 12,000 francs per month, not the current 10,000 francs. The declaration also stated that since the government is unwilling to fulfill its promises, workers will henceforth rely on their own organization and unity to achieve the satisfaction of their legitimate demands. It is generally believed that this declaration by the General Confederation of Labor is tantamount to declaring war on the government's financial reform plan (including the freezing of wages), and it is expected that another nationwide strike movement will occur in three or four weeks.</p>
<h3>Romanian Parliament Dissolved, General Election to be Held Next Month</h3>
<p>[United Press International, Bucharest, 24th] The Romanian Parliament today voted to dissolve itself automatically, and it was decided that an election would be held on March 26 to form a new parliament to draft a new constitution.</p>

<h3>The Memoirs of Hull</h3>
<p>—Copyright by the North American Newspaper Alliance—Compiled by the Editorial Department of this Newspaper</p>
<p>Chit-Chatting on Wheat Planting and Raft Making in the Kremlin</p>
<p>On the evening of October 18, the foreign ministers of the three countries met in the Kremlin, showing every sign of sincere cooperation and being able to act effectively. We quickly agreed on several points, such as: not giving speeches, the selection of advisors participating in our meeting, the meeting location, and the first communiqué to be issued.</p>
<p>When I returned to the embassy, I saw a telegram from the State Department regarding a cable that Mr. Churchill sent to the President on October 12, in which he suggested that the heads of the three countries issue a joint communiqué on the punishment of Germans who committed atrocities. The telegram stated that the President hoped I would consider the wording of this statement so that it could be issued at the end of the Moscow Conference.</p>
<p>It was also suggested that, in addition to not affecting the actions we might take against past offenders, special warnings should be issued regarding present and future atrocities. This was to prevent forcing German criminals to extremes and killing innocent victims when there was no way out.</p>
<p>Before the first formal meeting scheduled for the afternoon of the 19th, Eden and Molotov both visited me individually at Spaso House (the American Embassy).</p>
<p>Sir Kerr, the British Ambassador who accompanied Eden (who later became the British Ambassador to Washington), raised the Soviet side's desire to discuss military issues, especially the issue of a second front. I stated that I would explain the United States' determination, which was to carry out the war to the end and provide full assistance to its allies. We agreed that we should give the Soviet Union full information about our plans, the reasons for our decisions, and the results obtained, and accept any suggestions it wished to make, but it should be made clear that military negotiations could not be conducted at the meeting.</p>
<p>The first question I raised to Molotov was about the Soviet censorship system. American reporters were not allowed to publish human interest stories about the arrival of the American delegation in Moscow. I asked him whether it was not allowed to publish news about the general situation of the meeting that did not involve official work. Molotov loudly said that the censor was "stupid" and said that he would pay attention to this.</p>
<p>Just before we went to the meeting (December 23), Molotov said that he had discussed with Stalin the declaration in the President's proposal regarding German atrocities. Stalin had indicated his agreement after making slight modifications.</p>
<p>When atrocities were discussed at the meeting, the Soviet side took a firm stance. They had suffered greatly at the hands of the Germans, and they hoped for severe and swift legal sanctions against the German officials responsible for the mass murder of Soviet citizens.</p>
<p>Eden argued that all legal formalities should be observed.</p>
<p>When it was my turn to speak, I said:</p>
<p>"If it were up to me, I would bring Hitler, Mussolini, Tojo, and their main accomplices and take them to a temporary military court on the battlefield. At sunrise the next day, a historic event would take place."</p>
<p>When these words were translated, Molotov and his entire delegation cheered loudly, expressing their approval, and the peace of the meeting was temporarily broken.</p>
<p>The main point I had in mind regarding this issue when I was in Moscow was that the world should deal in a drastic way with the situation caused by powerful dictators and their plans to conquer and enslave the world, as well as their barbaric methods. I felt that this type of fugitive from justice should be dealt with directly and quickly, just as they dealt directly and quickly with the innocent people of the world.</p>
<p>I assumed that when we caught the three Axis leaders and their chiefs, we could also obtain their secret documents, and if we tried them according to international law, we would have to deal with them to some extent. But I did not want this step to prevent us from quickly disposing of these bandit chiefs.</p>
<p>I had raised this view to President Roosevelt and also to Prime Minister Churchill and Eden when they visited Moscow. I had also raised it several times in cabinet meetings. I said frankly that I thought all the war instigators from Germany, Japan, and Italy should be hanged.</p>
<p>During my tenure at the State Department, my views were not definitely rejected. But after I resigned from the post of Secretary of State, formal trials became favored.</p>
<p>But I don't want to be seen as opposing the Nuremberg trials. When it was later decided to do so, I heartily supported it. My opinion was only about different trial methods.</p>
<p>Almost a week after I arrived in Moscow, I said to Molotov that I did not know how to arrange a meeting with Marshal Stalin; I did not know how long I had to wait or whether I had waited too long; but if I could see his "boss", I would consider it an honor in any case. I left this matter to Molotov.</p>
<p>Eden had seen Stalin shortly after arriving in Moscow, but he had arranged the meeting beforehand. I had not arranged anything. My theory was that I should handle matters with Molotov and not let him think that I wanted to bypass him and contact Stalin.</p>
<p>Molotov very quickly informed me that Stalin would receive me at the Kremlin at 3 p.m. on October 25.</p>
<p>I knew that one of the main topics of our conversation would be about the proposed meeting of Roosevelt, Stalin, and Churchill. Before and after my arrival in Moscow, the President had been exchanging telegrams with Stalin on the issue of the meeting. In principle, it had already been agreed to hold the meeting, but an insurmountable obstacle had arisen regarding the location of the meeting.</p>
<p>In a telegram on October 14, the President suggested Baghdad, the capital of Iraq, or Asmara, the capital of Italian Eritrea occupied by British forces in East Africa, or Ankara, the capital of Turkey. Stalin had already suggested Tehran. The President suggested November 20 or 25 as the meeting date.</p>
<p>On October 17, Stalin replied that he could not accept any of the locations suggested by the President in place of Tehran. He said that it was not a question of security, which he did not worry about, but of maintaining close contact with the current offensive operations of the Soviet army. He said that his colleagues believed that these operations required him to maintain personal contact with the Supreme Command. In Tehran, this contact could be guaranteed because there were telegraph and telephone lines directly to Moscow.</p>
<p>The President sent me a cable on October 21, claiming that after carefully assessing the time factor and his own constitutional responsibilities, he considered Tehran impossible for him. What he meant was that he could not go to such an isolated place that he could not receive bills from Congress and send them back within ten days. Due to the mountains, Tehran was difficult to reach by plane, and it might be necessary to wait several days before flying into and out of the city.</p>
<p>The President said that Stalin did not show understanding of the constraints Roosevelt was under in several telegrams in response to the President. Therefore, he wanted me to deliver a telegram to Stalin and explain to him orally the definite and clear reasons why he did not want to go to Tehran, which were not due to personal preferences but were stipulated by the Constitution.</p>
<p>So he suggested Basra in Iraq as a substitute. Stalin could run a special telephone line from Tehran to Basra, managed by the Soviets, so he could still maintain direct contact with Inskoe.</p>
<p>The President argued strongly that he was willing to travel from the United States to any place within 600 miles of Soviet territory. He had to maintain a constitutional government that had been established for more than 150 years and abide by its regulations. If it were not for this, he would be willing to travel ten times the distance to meet Stalin. He concluded that if Stalin, Churchill, and himself could not meet because of a few hundred miles, future generations would consider it a tragedy.</p>
<p>On the afternoon of October 25, when I was sitting in front of Stalin next to an earthen-colored cabinet in the Kremlin, I explained all the points to him. Ambassador Harriman and Charles E. Bohlen were with me, while Molotov and a translator sat on either side of Stalin.</p>
<p>When I walked into the Marshal's office, he came in from another door, met me halfway, and shook hands. He was very sincere and approachable. He led me to my seat next to the table and sat opposite me, with his back to the wall.</p>
<p>Our conversation began with personal chit-chat. We exchanged views on the issue of how to plant wheat. I told Stalin that in Tennessee, wheat had to be planted six inches deep, which seemed novel to him. We discussed how to make rafts. I described how we used walnut vines to connect the wood in Tennessee. Stalin described how his people used grape vines to make rafts.</p>
<p>I told Stalin about my joy in coming to Moscow, and that my wish to visit his country for many years had finally come true.</p>
<p>I said that I had attended many international conferences in my life, but in all international conferences, I had not received more thoughtful hospitality than we had received from our hosts, the Soviet government, especially Molotov. Stalin replied that he could not have imagined such criticism.</p>
<p>I pointed out that one of the most important tasks of the current meeting was to lay a foundation for the meeting of himself, President Roosevelt, and Churchill, and for this meeting, all the people of our country, and in fact all the people of the world, who are engaged in the fight against Nazism and Fascism, expressed the greatest hope, so I presented to Stalin the President's telegram regarding the location of the meeting.</p>
<p>After reading the Russian translation, Stalin handed it to Molotov, stating that it had to be considered and discussed with his colleagues. After reading it, Foreign Minister Molotov said that important military operations were currently underway, and all the senior military and political bureaus of the Soviet government unanimously believed that Stalin absolutely could not leave, but when it was unavoidable, he could only go to a place where direct communication could be maintained every day.</p>
<p>So Stalin suggested that it would be best to postpone the meeting until the spring of the following year, when Fairbanks in Alaska would be a suitable location.</p>
<p>I said that the President and I both deeply felt that the international situation required this meeting, and if it could not be held in a timely manner, it would cause deep disappointment among the people of all Allied countries, because its influence would unite our three countries and strengthen cooperation to carry out the war and implement cooperation in the post-war period.</p>
<p>Stalin interjected that he was not opposed to the meeting in principle.</p>
<p>I replied that I understood that he was only thinking about the practical ways we were discussing.</p>
<p>He argued strongly that there was no question of stubbornness or prestige on his part, but he could not understand why the delay of national documents for a day or two should be so important, while an occasional mistake in military operations could not be corrected after a grammatical error, but had to be paid for with the lives of thousands of people. As far as he was concerned, the difficulty of meeting in Basra was entirely about material arrangements, especially communication.</p>
<p>Stalin said that he did not have any worries about the issue of security. He made this point after Ambassador Harriman said that the heads of the three countries could live in their own tents in the mountains behind Basra, defended by their own troops, thus guaranteeing complete isolation and security.</p>
<p>As our conversation continued for an hour—actually half an hour, because of the time required for translation—because the time for the meeting was near, I said to Stalin that because I was a student of Molotov, it was time to go to class. The Marshal smiled at me and wished us good luck.</p>
<p>When the discussion ended, he stood up, walked around the table, shook hands with me, and said something in Russian. His translator was still sitting at the table finishing his notes, and Stalin's words thus disappeared into thin air. The Marshal turned back to the translator and said very sharply to him that a translator's responsibility was to always be by his side (Bohlen later told me this). I then learned that Stalin had expressed great pleasure in being able to see me.</p>

<h3>Emergency Motion in the Senate Urges Government to Stabilize Prices, Special Committee Formed for Review This Morning</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Yesterday was the third day of the fifth session of the Senate. The third meeting was held in the afternoon. In addition to reports on policy implementation by the Directors of the Bureau of Health, the Bureau of Public Works, and the Bureau of Public Utilities, Senators questioned the Directors of the Bureau of Education, the Bureau of Health, and the Bureau of Public Works. The Directors of the Bureau of Education and the Bureau of Health responded. Two urgent proposals, one impromptu motion, and one discussion on an impromptu emergency motion were passed. The impromptu emergency motion was proposed by Wang Xianqing and eighteen others, "In order to alleviate the suffering of the people and adopt effective measures to fundamentally stabilize prices to reassure the people." The original listed measures are as follows: "(1) Regarding the allocation of foreign exchange and subsidies for public utilities and transportation enterprises belonging to the Central Government, urgently request the Central Government to handle them. (2) Regarding local public utilities and transportation enterprises, request the municipal government to implement them promptly. (3) Prices are rising daily, and the Central Government and the Municipal Government should rapidly address these measures in the shortest possible time." Later, because the case was of great importance and required lengthy discussion, the general meeting decided: "(1) A special review committee should be organized to review this case. The review meeting is scheduled to be held at 10:00 AM on February 26th in the conference room on the second floor of this council. (2) The Speaker and Deputy Speaker of the council will serve as conveners of the review committee. (3) The list of review committee members will be authorized to be drafted by the Speaker. The original proposer and cosigners should attend the review committee. "The proposed list is: Pan Gongzhan, Wang Xianqing, Xu Ji, Chu Shun, Dong Ganwen, Ge Jiesen, Li Wenjie, Yan Esheng, Zhou Xiangsheng, Lao Jing, Zhao Dihua, Shui Xiangyun, Xu Baohua, Guo Linshuang, Wang Zonghao, Zhou Xuexiang, Huang Bingquan, Jiang Haoran, Xi Yushu, Zhou Feicheng, Tao Baichuan, Feng Youzhen, Chen Baotai, Gao Junting, Wang Yansong, Lu Bingkun, Zhan Wenyu, Yang Gongshu, Cao Jun, Zheng Shouzhi, Cui Chonghan, Liu Jingji, He Pinheng, Wei Fusheng, Shao Yongsheng, Wang Naixu. (4) All Senators who have not been appointed as members of the review committee are also welcome to attend freely. (5) The Mayor of Shanghai, the Director of the Bureau of Social Affairs, the Director of the Bureau of Public Utilities, the Director of the Bureau of Police, the Director of the Bureau of Finance, the Chief Accountant of the Shanghai Municipal Government, the Director of the Cotton Yarn and Cloth Control Committee, the Deputy Director of the Civil Food Allocation Committee, and the Director of the Shanghai Financial Management Bureau are all requested to attend the review committee meeting. (6) Proposal No. 25 of the fifth session will be incorporated into the review of this case.</p>
<h3>Call on the National Government to Strengthen the Northeast</h3>
<p>The remaining urgent proposals were: (1) Zhou Lianze et al. proposed "Call on the National Government to strengthen the Northeast, recover lost territory, and stabilize the situation." The resolution was passed as proposed. (2) "It is proposed that the Municipal Government order the Bureau of Civil Affairs to instruct the heads of each district and baojia to investigate the actual rent situation in each district of the city' in order to determine rent standards to stabilize residents." The method is to investigate the rent for December 1947 and January 1948 and compare it with the rent in 1937. Resolution: Request the heads of each district and baojia to complete the work within the day and publish a notice to the public. There was one impromptu motion, which was to retain Director Zhang Wei.</p>
<h3>Difficulties in Improvement Due to Budget Shortages, Zhang Wei Expresses Eagerness to Leave, Unanimous Impromptu Motion to Retain Him</h3>
<p>Director Zhang of the Bureau of Health reported on his work, explaining the epidemic prevention facilities, environmental sanitation, health care services, and pharmaceutical management in detail, but due to lack of funds, although he tried his best to improve, he still failed to achieve the ideal. Taking the manure trucks as an example, 500 new trucks are needed, but there are only 200, leaving a shortage of 300. Therefore, even broken trucks must continue to be used. In terms of personnel, last year there were more than 2,000 people in all units of the bureau, but due to the low salaries, more than 500 people have left so far, and it is impossible to retain them. This is because the salaries of medical personnel, etc., are five times higher than those of civil servants if they work in other institutions. The bureau has now launched moral and cultivation training to encourage colleagues to support each other, which has seen considerable progress. Of the twelve cases resolved by the previous Senate, four have not been handled, such as the fact that a civilian hospital has not been established in the Putuo district, and the Yinxiang Hospital has not been taken over, etc. However, this is not because they have not been handled, but because they have not been completed, and they will continue to be handled in the future.</p>
<p>The Sins of the Bureau of Health Are All My Personal Responsibility</p>
<p>Finally, Director Zhang expressed his intention to leave, saying sincerely, "I speak simply, and I am also simple. I can manage to feed my family, but I cannot solve the problem of feeding thousands of families under me. I am really incompetent and want to do a good job but cannot. In the past two years, I have received a lot of guidance from you, and I am very grateful for your comfort. This may be the last time I attend the conference. Regarding the more than 9,000 employees in each unit of the bureau, it is impossible to say that there is not a single bad person, but the atmosphere has improved a lot recently, which is also thanks to everyone. For the past twenty-one months, all the sins of the Bureau of Health are my personal responsibility. I ask for everyone's forgiveness."</p>
<p>Senator Wu Zhengjue and seventy others were very moved by Director Zhang's words and made an impromptu motion before the adjournment: "Director Zhang of the Bureau of Health is a nationally renowned public health expert. He works hard, and it is recommended that the Mayor retain him and not let him resign." The motion was unanimously passed by the general meeting.</p>
<p>Why Are There No Regulations on Manure Collection Time and Fees?</p>
<p>Regarding the questions to the Bureau of Health, Chen Peide raised the question of why there are no regulations on the time for manure collectors to dump manure, and the fees are arbitrarily increased, disturbing the citizens. In addition, manure collectors dump manure into the sewers, which is detrimental to hygiene and should be banned. Zhang Zhongyuan asked whether the over-the-counter drugs sold publicly on the radio have been inspected by the authorities, and why they have not been banned. Qu Yue asked to pay attention to hygiene in the suburbs and to consult with the police department to allow small restaurants near entertainment venues to extend their business hours.</p>
<p>Negligence of Hospital Staff Should Be Given Special Attention</p>
<p>Jia Dechao reported that the staff of the Gongji Hospital are very arrogant and negligent. Previously, a friend was injured in the foot by a car and sought treatment at the hospital. At that time, the injury was not serious, and the nurse simply treated it, saying that he only needed to stay for a few days. However, after a few days, the bone suddenly became inflamed, and the doctor cut it off. However, due to the careless surgery, he soon became ill again, and it was cut again and again, for a total of three cuts. This kind of turning a healthy person into a cripple is really cruel, and the health authorities should pay special attention to it. In addition, the Bureau of Health did not cremate ownerless coffins but burned coffins with owners. This is a criminal offense, and it is said that families of coffins with owners pay some money and then they are not burned. I don't know if the Director is aware of this?</p>
<p>Garbage Accumulates on the Road, Reaching a Distance of Twenty Feet</p>
<p>Jiang Hao said that the garbage accumulated on the road in front of my house reached a distance of twenty feet. I saw it every day and was extremely disgusted. It had not been removed for several months. I was planning to raise it at this session of the conference, but the garbage suddenly disappeared the day before the meeting. Is there such a coincidence? Is the garbage disposal fee issued once a month or once every three months? The contractor's responsibility is to clear the garbage. If it is dumped into the river, is it not contradictory to dredging the river? Lu Huimin asked about the preparations for epidemic prevention and vaccination. He also asked to pay attention to the garbage in the alleys. Youth Party Senator Wang Zonghao said: (1) The city's public cleanliness and hygiene are very different from what was done in the concession era in the past. (2) Forced epidemic prevention work is not thorough enough. Zhou Lianze said: There is still half of the space in the small vegetable market, but the entrance is extremely crowded. The Bureau of Health has supervisors. Why don't they contact the police to ban it?</p>
<p>Immediately Dismiss Manure Collectors Found to Be in Violation of Regulations</p>
<p>Director Zhang replied to each question one by one: (1) There have always been regulations on the time for clearing manure. It is after 9:00 in the winter and after 8:00 in the summer. If you see a manure truck on the road, the police can arrest it. Later, during the winter defense period, some people impersonated manure collectors and entered the homes of citizens to rob them, so it was not convenient to do it too early. Also, because there were not enough vehicles, some people had to pull them several times, which extended the time, but we are still urging the police to pay attention at all times. There are regulations on fees. If violations are found, they will be dismissed. At the same time, citizens are asked not to give too much money. As for dumping manure into the sewers, in addition to the eight designated locations that lead directly to the manure plant, the only way to deal with lazy manure collectors who arbitrarily dump manure into the sewers is to dismiss them.</p>
<p>Hygiene in Suburban Areas Will Not Be Discriminated Against</p>
<p>(2) There are management regulations for the sale of drugs on the radio and the publication of drugs in newspapers, but it is much more difficult to manage radio stations than newspapers. We will definitely strictly enforce them in the future. (3) There will be no discrimination against cleanliness in the suburbs. The Bureau of Health has always attached importance to outdoor and indoor cleanliness and actively promoted citizen awareness. (4) Medical ethics of hospital staff. I hope everyone will pay attention to it. The Bureau of Health should pay attention to both public and private hospitals. (5) Small workers giving money for owner-occupied coffins have been found in the Yangjing district and have been dismissed.</p>
<p>Garbage That Has Been Accumulated for a Long Time Will Be Severely Dealt With</p>
<p>(6) The delay in garbage removal is due to the difficulty in exporting ships. If it is found that garbage has been accumulated for a long time, please report it to the bureau, and we will severely punish the garbage collectors. (7) Public health is indeed not as good as it was before the war, but if there were the same conditions as before the war, it would not necessarily be done worse than before the war. According to the number of people before the war, there should be more than 7,000 people working now, but there are currently only 5,000 people inside and outside the bureau. (8) We did not want to rush the epidemic prevention in the first year, but we will strengthen it this year. Vaccination will begin on March 1. The number of people vaccinated last year broke the record for any previous year. (9) We will continue to work hard to improve other situations, such as small vegetable markets, but they have already made progress compared to before.</p>
<h3>Freak: Born with Two Extra Arms and Two Extra Legs</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] On the 23rd of this month, Gan Jishi, the wife of Gan Qiqing, a villager in Chenjiazhai south of the God of Wealth Temple in Nanxiang Town on the Jinghu Line, gave birth to a freak after a full-term pregnancy. In addition to the head being no different from ordinary people, the whole body has four arms, four legs, and two reproductive organs, all of which are male (see picture). This is Gan's second child. After giving birth, she saw that it was strange and considered it very unlucky, so she let it freeze to death. The dead infant is now stored in the Huimin Couple Hospital in Nanxiang West Market for medical research.</p>
<h3>Education Bureau Answers Questions: Out-of-School Children Are Being Investigated, Opportunity to Study at Night Will Be Provided</h3>
<p>The Senators continued to ask questions of the Bureau of Education the day before yesterday. Zhang Yiqu asked first, why has a national school not been established in the Old Gate district to this day? Director Li used the excuse of not being able to find a location to shirk responsibility. Has he actually looked for it? If there is never any land, will it never be established? The citizens of the Old Gate district pay the most taxes, but not a single school is established. Can the residents of the district pay 20% less taxes in the future? Lu Shidao asked why there is no national school in Yangshupu? Wang Weisi asked whether qualified teachers who have been certified have job security? What progress has been made in allocating special funds for the construction of national schools in suburban areas, as resolved at the previous conference? Qu Yue asked to quickly establish the Xinlu Normal School. Jia Dechao said, (1) Adult literacy classes should be established with 50 people. Often, they are established when the number of people is insufficient, which is a waste of money. (2) There are so many out-of-school children. How can we remedy it? Zhang Zhongyuan reported that primary school students came to solicit donations in coffee shops during the New Year. Has the Bureau of Education approved this donation? Qian Songping said that school equipment is simple and hoped that the quality would be improved. Li Shuzi said: (1) The primary school in Xinjingjiang Town has no fence. Students play and walk on the road, and vehicles are very dangerous. Not only can the school authorities not collect tuition fees, but they also have to give away books. (2) There are no mats in the classrooms of the Zhenru Xiku School. This situation proves that suburban schools have no subsidies, and the government should allocate special funds. (3) Why is the substitute teaching fee for female teachers so slow to be issued? By the time it is received, they have already had their second child.</p>
<p>No Vacant Land Can Be Found to Build Schools in the Old Gate District</p>
<p>Director Li immediately replied separately: (1) At least one school can be established in the Old Gate district this year. There is really no public land to be found. If private land can be exchanged for other public land from the Municipal Government, we are also willing to do so. After this conference, we will ask the district chief, bao chiefs, and senators of the Old Gate district to jointly plan and find a location, and funds can be requested. Zhang Yiqu was still dissatisfied with Director Li's reply and asked Mayor Wu to reply again. The Mayor said that there is only public land on Xiamen Road in the Old Gate district that can be used to build a school, but there are buildings on the land. If we forcibly demolish them, the citizens will petition. We cannot afford to buy private land. This issue can only be answered after consulting with the senators and district chiefs. Director Li replied to the questions again: (2) The Yangshupu Central Primary School will be prepared to be established after the Sports College moves to Jiangwan.</p>
<p>20 Billion Will Be Allocated to Help Suburban Schools</p>
<p>(3) We are paying attention to the rectification of private schools at any time. More than a dozen middle and primary schools have been banned. The certification of teachers gives them qualifications, but it does not necessarily give them a position. Special funds have been allocated to help suburban schools and have been approved by the Municipal Government. 20 billion will be allocated. (4) The Xinlu Normal School's school buildings were previously demolished by unscrupulous elements to build rooms. In the future, they will be required to compensate, so that they can be repaired. (5) Out-of-school children are being investigated and will be given the opportunity to study at night. Children of public school teachers are given free tuition because some institutions already have tuition loan funds, so they should not be given it again. (6) We have found out that primary school students are soliciting donations, but the school has denied it after investigation. It must be known that there are many people who impersonate students, and there are also people who impersonate parents and teachers. The bureau will try its best to ban them. (7) The substitute teaching fee is indeed delayed because the procedures are troublesome. It can be issued within a week this time.</p>
<h3>The Bureau of Public Works Has a Hard Time: Heavy Workload, Difficult Finances</h3>
<p>Director Zhao Zukang of the Bureau of Public Works reported on the situation of the bureau, including eight characters, namely "Heavy Workload, Difficult Finances." As for the work in the past, under the municipal construction donation item, the first phase of 9 billion was used to build roads on a total of 14 lines, totaling more than 50,000 square meters. The second phase of funds has not been received, and it was allocated by the Municipal Government. More than 20 road lines total more than 50,000 square meters. Half of it has been completed, totaling 27,000 square meters. It is hoped that this item can be tripled in the second half of the year, that is, 54 billion will be collected, and two-thirds will be used to build roads and one-third to repair bridges. The ditches and canals are being improved, and water accumulation on Jiaozhou Road can be reduced this year. There are a total of 17 bridges over the Suzhou River, 11 of which were damaged during the war. Seven have been repaired, and the other four have not yet been completed. Wharves 1 to 9 in Nanshi have been completed, and 10 to 12 are in preparation. They can be completed after October. 2.6 million cubic meters of sludge need to be dredged from the Suzhou River. It is planned to dredge 50,000 cubic meters per month, which can be completed in three years, with a budget of 240 billion yuan. There are 800,000 cubic meters of dredging work. 240,000 were completed last year, and 240,000 can be used for work relief. By the end of March, 16 miles south of the Gaoqiao Seaside Bathing Beach can be completed for the sea wall project, and cars can pass through. The future plan is to promote urban planning in particular and speed up the construction of bridges over the Suzhou River. However, the difficulties are finances, materials, and personnel. In terms of the regular budget, it is far from enough. (1) The maintenance fee was 6.9 billion in 1946, 32 billion last year, and only 90 billion this year, which is two times less than last year and the year before. (2) The new construction fee was 9.5 billion in 1946, 54.2 billion last year, and only 36 billion this year, which is 40% less than last year. The material cost this year is 15 to 20 times higher than last year.</p>
<h3>Many Questions Will Be Answered Today</h3>
<p>The senators asked questions including (1) Zhong Yuliang asked why Pudong Avenue is not built. If there are not enough funds, a part can be built first. (2) Zhang Xuelian said that the potholes on Longhua Road are filled with mud. Can this be improved? (3) Shao Yongsheng said that Guihua Road is like a muddy road, and you have to wear galoshes even on sunny days. (4) Shan Ming asked when the north-south trunk road of Longhua will begin construction? The work relief project in Puhui Pond has not completed 20% of the work after one and a half months of construction. This will affect the spring plowing. (5) Zhang Zhihan asked why the private land in Pudong that was requisitioned for road construction has not been compensated. Residents plan to destroy the road, and the authorities should pay attention. (6) Jiang Huaishu said that the road surface near Pingwang Street on Fuzhou Road is very narrow, and the houses protrude. Why are they not demolished? Director Zhao will answer today because there was not enough time yesterday.</p>
<h3>Today's Agenda</h3>
<p>The agenda for the fourth meeting this afternoon is as follows: The Director of the Bureau of Public Works will answer questions. Question and answer session with the Bureau of Public Utilities. Work reports from the Bureau of Civil Affairs, the Bureau of Police, and the Bureau of Social Affairs. Reports from representatives of each district chief and representatives of the district people's congress. If time permits, questions and answers will be asked to the Bureau of Civil Affairs, the Bureau of Police, and the Bureau of Social Affairs.</p>
<h3>Aircraft Raise Freight Rates Case, Interrogation of Personnel of Two Companies, It Is Said That There Is No Fixed Air Freight Rate</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The case of the Beijing office of China and Central Airlines being accused of raising freight rates without authorization was heard in court yesterday by the District Prosecutor's Office. In the morning, the prosecutor summoned Jiang Nengxiang, chief of the cargo and mail section of China Airlines, Liu Anping, acting business director, and Xu Xin, director of the Beijing office. As a result, they were each ordered to submit a written guarantee of 500 million yuan. In the afternoon, the prosecutor summoned Zha Zhenhu, deputy general manager of Central Airlines, and Deng Gaozhang, director of the operations group. Zha and Deng were both respondents and were ordered to return. It is reported that the content of yesterday's interrogation was (1) whether freight rates were raised without authorization, and (2) whether the names of Heji and Huamao Transportation Companies were fictitious. The defendants and respondents said that air freight rates are not fixed. According to custom, the rates are determined based on cost. As for the higher freight rates between Beijing and Taiyuan, it is because merchants often charter planes back and forth between Beijing, and the freight is calculated on the basis of round trip. Even if the plane flies back empty, the freight must be paid. Outsiders do not understand the truth, which has caused misunderstandings. The prosecutor immediately ordered Central Airlines to submit the Ministry of Transportation's order regarding the regulation of freight rates to the District Prosecutor's Office for reference. Among the defendants in the case, Xu Xin, director of the Beijing office of China Airlines, is suspected of being more serious. The court will continue to hear the case this morning. The director of the Beijing office of Central Airlines did not attend due to illness.</p>

<h3>Refugees in the Third Refugee Shelter Still Can't Get Enough to Eat, Mayor Wu Visited with Senators Yesterday, All Knelt Down and Begged</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The Third Refugee Shelter on Jungong Road in this city has been open for two months, but because the management is not perfect, when Speaker Pan and his wife visited last time, many refugees shouted "We can't get enough to eat" and knelt down and begged, which was very pitiful. Various newspapers have also criticized it a lot. Mayor Wu is very concerned and went to visit yesterday morning with Director Wu Kaixian of the Bureau of Social Affairs, Senators Shao Yongsheng, Yao Baozhen, Tong Lian, and Huang Zhensheng.</p>
<p>The weather was clear yesterday. When Mayor Wu and his party went there, the refugees were gathering outside in the sun. There were more than 700 refugees in total, divided into children's groups, men's groups, and women's groups. When the Mayor arrived, they all stood up and paid their respects. The children's group shouted "Long live the Republic of China" while clapping their hands, which was obviously trained in advance. In addition to visiting the Third Refugee Shelter, Mayor Wu also went to Jiangwan to visit the work relief refugee shelter and expressed his satisfaction with the refugees who were dredging the river for work relief.</p>
<p>This reporter was the second time to visit the Third Refugee Shelter yesterday. I felt that the facilities had been significantly improved. For example, refugees used to drink raw water, but yesterday there was hot water available. Refugees used to be scantily clad, and the bedrooms were full of stench, but yesterday they were all wearing gray cotton socks and trousers, and the bedrooms were also disinfected, and everyone had a snow-white towel around their neck. One refugee child specially told the reporter: This towel was given by Speaker Pan's wife.</p>
<p>This reporter arrived an hour earlier than Mayor Wu yesterday. According to a refugee woman who secretly told the reporter: "We still can't get enough to eat. We only have two meals a day, and we are only allowed to eat a little more than one bowl for each meal, but we don't dare to say it. Whoever says it will be beaten..." At this time, an office worker from the shelter was seen coming, and the refugee woman stopped talking immediately. The reporter hoped to understand the truth and wanted to talk to a few refugees, but because the office worker was always with them, the refugees did not dare to speak. As soon as the office worker left, the refugees rushed to tell the reporter. It is said that the two meals are both half-wet and half-dry, and they can't eat two bowls each, so they are really hungry. Whoever tells outsiders that "we can't get enough to eat" will be "punished", so when Mayor Wu came, we didn't dare to tell the truth.</p>
<p>When Mayor Wu visited the women's group and the children's group yesterday, the women and children did not say anything, but when he passed the men's group, someone in the refugees shouted "Kneel down and sue Mayor Wu", and then they all knelt down, thumped their chests, wiped their tears, cried bitterly, and shouted "We can't get enough to eat". The office workers around Mayor Wu said: "We have two meals of dry rice every day, two bowls per person. We should be able to get enough to eat. You can tell from the faces of the refugees." Mayor Wu was unable to cope for a while.</p>
<p>According to the director of the shelter, the food standard for refugees is two dou of rice per person per month, and the vegetable fee is 2,000 yuan per person per day, which is indeed not enough. It is said that it is expected to increase slightly from today, so the management of refugees in the future may be improved.</p>
<h3>Rice Distribution Can Be Implemented Before the 10th of Next Month</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The matter of expanding the organization of the Civil Food Allocation Committee in this city will be implemented after the official central government document arrives within the day. Ren Xianqun will serve as the chairman. Ren gathered relevant parties at his private residence yesterday afternoon to discuss the technical issues of comprehensive rice distribution in this city and study the rice distribution procedures. It is said that the rice distribution date is planned to be advanced. The purchase certificates are being printed in a hurry. The citizens of Shanghai will be able to purchase one dou of rice with their certificates on March 10. According to Director Wu of the Bureau of Social Affairs, the rice price is calculated at 95% of the average market price for the last five days of last month.</p>
<h3>Sugar Distribution for the Tenth Period Can Be Distributed Around March 20</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The Sugar Group of the Shanghai Municipal Price Review Committee held its 22nd review meeting at the Bureau of Social Affairs yesterday morning. The chairman was Gu Bingyuan, and the resolutions are as follows: Sugar distribution will be held for six periods this year, one period every two months. The tenth period of sugar distribution will be based on the population in January, the eleventh period will be based on the population in March, and so on. Each person will still be allocated one catty per period. The distribution price for the tenth period of sugar distribution will be calculated at 60% of the distribution price of 13,500 yuan in January, which is 8,000 yuan per catty. After adding the fees for district baojia, transportation, and sugar certificate printing, the retail price will be 12,000 yuan per catty, and it will be distributed around March 20.</p>
<h3>Jardine Brewery Director, German, Robbed and Beaten to Death, Cook Suspected and Detained</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Leiner, a German, 61 years old, the director and engineer of Jardine Brewery at 350 Dinghai Road, Pudong, has been working in the factory for 13 years. His wife, Anna Leiner, 57 years old, lives in the factory on the fourth floor. Last night at around 10 pm, Anna had already gone to sleep, and Leiner was typing a letter to his daughter in the room. Unexpectedly, five gangsters broke in. Three of them covered their faces with cloth and climbed up the stairs from the wasteland behind, opened the door of the fourth floor, threatened with guns, and handcuffed Leiner backwards, tying him to the handrail of the stairs. His wife, Anna, was also dragged up and forced to hand over gold bars and jewelry. Leiner refused and was brutally beaten by the gangsters. His wife reluctantly opened the safe and was robbed of 60 taels of gold, seven large and small diamond rings, and 1,750 US dollars, with an estimated loss of more than 100 million yuan, and fled with the stolen goods. However, Leiner eventually fell to the ground due to his injuries and died shortly after. Anna suffered from neurasthenia and also fainted. It was not until after 12 o'clock in the middle of the night that she woke up and reported it to the Yangshupu Police Station. The police station immediately sent officers to investigate. It is reported that a cook is suspected and has been detained. The escaped criminals are being pursued.</p>
<h3>International Black Market Gold Bullion Case: Fourteen Chinese and Foreign Defendants Interrogated; Records Unsigned; Liao Quanqi Retracts Testimony; Ye Jinyuan and Two Others Granted Bail</h3>
<p>[Report from this Newspaper] The case of Syrian national Mike Doe and others operating a black market for gold bullion was heard in court yesterday morning. The defendants present were Mike Doe, Liao Quanqi, Xue Lianhuang, Ye Jinyuan, Ye Defa, Ma Weiheng, Huang Fuhan, Zheng Jiayu, Lin Shangzhen, Zhong Jinding, Chen Dongliang, Yang Jiqian, Tang Jinshui, and Ma Tailia (female), totaling fourteen individuals. Mike Doe and Liao Quanqi, considered the most heavily implicated, were questioned for an extended period by Judge Zhu Yuhuang yesterday. According to Mike Doe's testimony, he had known Liao Quanqi for a year, during which time they traded in stocks, not gold bullion. He claimed that Mike Doe Trading Company was solely his own venture and that the gold bars found on him were collateral for loans, not for speculation. Liao Quanqi testified that the seventeen gold bars seized were his own. He denied his previous statement to the police that the bars belonged to Ma Xianglin, claiming that the statement was made with the consent of all fourteen individuals. He denied all his statements made at the police station, stating that he had not signed the records, attempting to retract his testimony entirely. Ma Tailia, found with US$263.25 on her person, also denied engaging in trading. Defendants Ye Jinyuan and Ye Defa, who were in custody, admitted to delivering gold bars to Liao Quanqi on two occasions: one bar the first time and four and a half bars the second time. All other defendants denied participating in the black market gold bullion operation. The court ordered that Ye Jinyuan and Ye Defa, who were in custody, be released on bail with written guarantees of 500 million yuan each. The remaining defendants were released on their original bail, and the hearing was adjourned to a later date.</p>
<h3>War Criminals Sentenced in Batches; Zhongye Jiuyong to be Tried Tomorrow</h3>

<h3>Captured Bandit Tang Jingyan and Others Interrogated by Garrison Headquarters Personnel</h3>
<p>[Report from this Newspaper] Tang Jingyan and six others, remnants of Ding Xishan's forces and self-proclaimed "Deputy Commander of the Jiangnan People's Liberation Army," have been interrogated by personnel dispatched from the Military Law Office of the Garrison Headquarters for several days. The interrogation is expected to conclude within a few days.

<h3>Disturbance at Qibao Lantern Festival; Workers and Villagers Clash</h3>
<p>Approximately 300 workers dredging the Puhuitang River in Qibao Township clashed violently with villagers at Tangwan Village, Bridge No. 7, over the forced seizure of chickens and ducks at around 9:00 PM the night before last. Thirty ringleaders among the foremen and workers were detained and handed over to the Longhua Police Station. Injured villagers Ma Buxiang and Ma Qin were transported to the Eighth Municipal Hospital.</p>
<h3>Zhao Zengjue Expresses Pessimism, Claims This is the Last Meeting</h3>
<p>Bureau of Public Utilities Director Zhao Zengjue's work report briefly stated that construction work is underway on the waterworks, with water currently supplied by artesian wells and large reservoirs. The truck ferry transports approximately 60 vehicles across the river daily. Suburban telephone services have been installed in eight locations, including Nanxiang and Dachang. Three towns, including Beiqiao, remain unequipped, and discussions are underway with the Telecommunications Bureau to expedite the process. Regarding electricity, the establishment of a Joint Power Company is the fundamental solution. The immediate solution is to task the power companies with increasing power generation, while also encouraging textile mills with machinery to generate their own electricity. The Shanghai Electric Power Company was originally slated to receive a 160,000-kilowatt generator, but due to the urgent needs in Europe, the United States has prioritized supplying Europe first. The Hwashang Electric Plant also planned to install three 2,000-kilowatt generators, but they have not yet been delivered due to transportation difficulties. Conserving electricity is truly necessary. For example, during the recent severe cold, residents used electric heaters, consuming an additional 19,000 kilowatts of electricity in a single day, causing textile mills to shut down. With current conservation efforts, 7,000 kilowatts can be saved daily. Without conservation, industrial power consumption would decrease by 26,000 kilowatts daily, accounting for 22% of the total, potentially affecting the jobs of 130,000 workers. Adjusting public utility prices is also a concern for me as a citizen, but the companies' inability to sustain themselves must also be considered.</p>
<p>Director Zhao concluded by expressing his inability to continue, stating that he had previously resigned to the mayor, who repeatedly urged him to stay. However, due to the recent surge in prices and his inability to properly account for them to the citizens, he is resigning again. This is his last meeting with everyone.</p>
<p>Due to time constraints, the Q&amp;A session regarding the Bureau of Public Utilities will be postponed to this afternoon.</p>
<h3>Fashion Company Owner Dies Over Woman; Gambling Den Boss During Enemy Occupation; Main Culprit Xia Shikui Fled to Hong Kong; Two Courts Investigating the Same Murder Case</h3>
<p>[Report from this Newspaper] Zhao Hewu, owner of the Meihua Fashion Company at 520 Linsen Middle Road, was murdered on November 18 last year in Caowang Township, Panjia Bridge, Jiading County. The murderer escaped in a black-market car with license plate 17734. The car belonged to Xia Shikui of 150 Guangyuan Road in this city. After investigation by relevant authorities, the inside story of the case came to light. Zhao's wife, Xia Manli, is related to Xia Shikui, a major rogue during the enemy occupation. Xia operated the Tongqing gambling den in the Nanshi district, the leading gambling den at the time. Xia cohabited with a beautiful croupier. Later, this croupier became involved with Zhao Hewu, which was discovered by Xia, who then plotted to kill him. After the incident, Xia fled, reportedly to Hong Kong. The murderer, Xu Liangtu, was apprehended by the Sixth Investigation Brigade of the Garrison Headquarters and transferred to the Jiading Court. Another murderer, Ma Qiang, is still at large. Recently, the deceased's mother, Zhao Shi, filed a petition with the District Procuratorate, requesting that the murderer Xu Liangtu be transferred to Shanghai for prosecution and that the fugitive murderers be apprehended. The District Procuratorate dispatched bailiffs to Xia Shikui's residence and Xia Yunkui's residence at 61 Xiafei Fang, but both had already fled. The case is currently under investigation by the District Procuratorate. However, the Jiading Court is also investigating the case, and it remains to be decided where the case will ultimately be handled.</p>

<h3>Draft-Age Men from Various Counties Coming to Shanghai Must Have Certification from County Magistrate</h3>
<p>[Report from this Newspaper] To ensure the smooth progress of conscription work, the Shanghai Garrison District and the Wu County Conscription District convened the first conscription meeting of the year the day before yesterday, bringing together county magistrates and military section chiefs from the counties under their jurisdiction. It was decided that this year's conscription in the district would be based on lottery. To prevent draft evasion, the Garrison District and Police Bureau of Shanghai were requested to issue notices during the conscription period stating that draft-age men from various counties coming to Shanghai must have certification from the county magistrate. Otherwise, they would be considered draft evaders and would be arrested and sent back to their hometown for immediate conscription. Their resettlement allowance would be deducted as punishment for draft evasion. The Songjiang Conscription District was also notified to instruct the counties to handle this matter in accordance with the law to prevent Shanghai from becoming a haven for draft-age men and hindering conscription.</p>

<h3>Knife-Wounded Female Corpse Found West of Huangxing Road</h3>
<p>[Report from this Newspaper] At around 8:00 AM yesterday, Lu Bao Cai, a farmer from Nantong residing at 23 Zhulongbang, west of Huangxing Road in Hudong, discovered a female corpse in a wasteland. The deceased was approximately 30 years old. Lu reported the discovery to the Maqiao Police Station of the Xinshi Street Police Bureau, which in turn reported it to the Xinshi Street Sub-Bureau. Wang Zhaoxin, Chief of the Sub-Bureau, instructed Liu Lianfang, Chief of the Criminal Investigation Section, along with officers Du Shuen, Du Shufan, and others, to investigate. The corpse was found to have delicate features. Her clothes were untied. There were 23 knife wounds on the back of her head, lower abdomen, neck, forehead, and wrists.

She was wearing a black gabardine cheongsam, a single Shilin cloth shirt, a coffee-colored wool sweater, a white undershirt, black gabardine pants, white shorts, sand-colored socks, and black cloth shoes, resembling a female worker.

<h3>Severe Spring Famine in Shandong</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Correspondent in Jinan on the 22nd] No province's spring famine problem is more concerning than Shandong's. Seemingly, there has never been a more severe spring famine in Shandong than this year. Although, on the surface, the government controls 41 counties and 3 municipalities in Shandong's 107 counties and 3 municipalities, in reality, both the occupied areas and the recovered areas suffered widespread drought and war disasters last year. Furthermore, Southern and Western Shandong experienced so-called floods and wind disasters.</p>
<p>According to Director of the Shandong Reconstruction Office Ding Jishi and our reporter, before the war, Shandong had</p>
<p>100 million mu of arable land.</p>
<p>However, in the southwestern areas of Shandong alone, the area flooded last year reached 3 million mu, accounting for one-thirtieth of the province's arable land. This is not a small number. Furthermore, the war disasters that have permeated the entire province during the eight years of resistance against Japan and the two years of internal conflict, especially the destruction, liquidation, and struggles by the communists, have pushed the entire rural area to the brink of collapse.</p>
<p>According to a survey conducted by the Shandong Reconstruction Office last May in 18 counties and cities, including Jinan, Licheng, Qihe, Puxian, Renping, Gaotang, Qingping, Enxian, Tengxian, Boxing, Zouping, Changqing, Laiwu, Zichuan, Linqu, Zhucheng, Anqiu, and Shouguang, the total average loss of agricultural resources was as follows: manpower loss reached slightly less than 55%, arable land abandonment reached slightly more than 41%, draft animal loss reached slightly more than 70%, livestock loss reached slightly more than 69%, large agricultural implement loss reached slightly more than 51%, and small agricultural implement loss reached slightly more than 45%. Although this is only partial statistical data, it is not difficult to infer the extent of destruction that the rural areas of Shandong have suffered.</p>
<p>Those who have traveled in the newly recovered areas or "liberated areas," especially in the Yimeng Mountains region, all feel that food and lodging are their</p>
<p>greatest threats.</p>
<p>The reason is that travelers in these areas often do not see a single person or complete house for dozens of miles. The fields are barren, and wild grasses are rampant. Even if one or two relatively complete houses are found, their doors are sealed with bricks and earth, and there is no one inside. It is said that the owners of these houses, unable to maintain their livelihoods, gather their meager belongings, seal the doors and windows, put their children on small carts, and lead their families on a hopeless flight to escape the famine! In reality, they are already too poor to even eat sweet potato stems or wild grass elm bark. The weaker ones either commit suicide individually or even commit suicide as a family. The more resilient ones either "exchange children for food and break up bones for fuel" or embark on the path of "escape" and "famine relief!"</p>
<p>The Shandong Provincial Government is aware of the severity of this year's</p>
<p>spring famine.</p>
<p>In addition to the concrete plans already drafted by the Department of Social Affairs and the Ministry of Social Relief and Rehabilitation to establish soup kitchens and reception centers throughout Shandong to show their commitment to relief, the Reconstruction Office has also submitted a request to the Ministry of Water Resources and received approval for an additional 1.8 billion yuan in funds for the</p>
<p>Chouxihui</p>
<p>project (and plans to request an additional 6 billion yuan to complete the entire project). 5 billion yuan will be used for the embankment restoration of the Southern Grand Canal from Shizhuang east of Nanyang Lake, passing Yan Village and circling Jining City to the Wuliying east of Machang Lake. All of the above will be used for work-for-food programs. In addition, the Relief and Rehabilitation Corps will allocate 15 tons of food in Zhangqiu for work-for-food to assist in repairing the Xiuhui Canal, and another 90 tons of food will be allocated in Jining for work-for-food to assist in repairing the Southern Grand Canal. It is estimated that by May this spring, the section of the</p>
<p>Xiuhui Canal from Chuanwangzhuang to Lijiatang in Zhangqiu will be completed,</p>
<p>which can irrigate more than 15,000 mu of land. If the entire 20-kilometer canal is completed, it can irrigate 80,000-90,000 mu of land. After the Southern Grand Canal embankment restoration project is completed, at least 800,000 mu of land between the Yun, Si, and Fu rivers and around the city of Jining, the Machang Lake area, and the banks of the Guang River, which were originally flooded, can be transformed into fertile farmland.</p>
<p>Currently, the biggest difficulties for the people are two: instability and poverty. They are so poor that they lack seeds, fertilizer, agricultural implements, and labor. The former depends on the increase in the number of regular national troops and the reconstruction of local armed forces. The latter is limited by the fact that the Shandong Provincial Government can only allocate agricultural implements and seeds for a maximum of 150,000 mu of land this year.</p>
<p>The biggest hope</p>
<p>is: (1) Request the Central Government to include Shandong in the list of production-increasing provinces, as with Hebei, and increase agricultural loans. (2) Request the Central Government to allocate a portion of the funds from the sale of 125,000 tons of US relief supplies to Shandong for agricultural rehabilitation. (3) Request the Central Government to allocate more relief supplies for work-for-food programs.</p>
<p>In recent days, approximately 60,000 personnel, the remnants of Chen Yi's First, Fourth, Sixth, and Eighth Column and the Two Guangzong Team cadre members, have successively fled from Henan, Hubei, and Anhui back to the Yuncheng, Juye, and Chengwu areas in southwestern Shandong. Adding the Tenth and Eleventh Columns, which originally remained in the area between Cao County and Shan County and to its east, there are a total of seven columns. The general view on Chen Bandit's</p>
<p>return flight</p>
<p>is that they are returning to replenish troops and rest and reorganize. However, some people are uneasy about whether the Jinpu Railway's Xuji section, which has been open for only ten weeks, will meet the same fate as the Jiaoji Railway did at this time last year. However, based on the principle of "sufficient food and troops," Chen Yi's maximum extent will only be to damage the Xuji section, but he will definitely not have greater ambitions or stay longer in the areas along the Xuji line, in the Yimeng Mountains area, or in other areas of Shandong. The reason is that the communist bandits, without a base supply system, cannot afford to supply such a large field army in the currently impoverished rural areas of Shandong. For the same reason, perhaps in the spring and summer, when the wheat seedlings mature, it will be the time for the main communist forces to formally flee back to Shandong and carry out large-scale looting. At that time, the Xuji section of the Jinpu Railway will probably enter the most tense and difficult stage since it opened. (Our Special Correspondent Li Tian)</p>
<h3>Lanzhou Broadcasting Station Completed</h3>
<p>[Report from Lanzhou on the 25th] After the completion of the new building for the Lanzhou Broadcasting Station, the 10,000-watt medium-wave transmitter has officially begun broadcasting. To test the broadcasting effectiveness, an agreement has been reached with the Ohio radio station to broadcast a special program of Mandarin news, Peking opera, dance music, and other items on February 29 from 5:00 PM to 6:30 PM in the Longshu area at a frequency of 820 kHz.</p>
<h3>Lantern Festival in Lanzhou</h3>
<p>[Report from Lanzhou on the 25th] This year's Farmers' Day, which was combined with the Lantern Festival, was solemnly held in the Guanshi area on the 24th. At this time when half of the country is suffering and countless lives are lost, the people of Gansu can still live and work in peace, all thanks to the efforts of the National Army soldiers. Therefore, there were many donations during the Spring Festival to support the troops, which have been remitted separately. Outer counties have also telegraphed the results of their efforts to support the troops and comfort the families of soldiers on expeditions, which are generally good. Most precious is the donation of a set of self-made automobile parts "Pei Siding" by a person named "Guanshi Laborer," whose original letter stated: "I have no money, but I have labor. I made some finished products and will donate them to the Social Affairs Office for labor to support the troops," which is deeply moving!</p>
<p>The fellow provincial associations mobilized folk performances a few days ago to celebrate the first Farmer's Day of the constitutional year. The performances included "Gaotai Tiexinzi" by the Shanxi Fellow Association, "Henan Lion" by the Henan Fellow Association, folk performances by the Linxia Fellow Association, and folk performances by local townships and associations. Each was unique. The streets of Lanzhou had become a sea of people. Wherever the performances passed, there was a surge of people. The drumming was deafening. Under the clear breeze and bright moon at night, singers sang Taiping songs, beating drums and howling to the sky. The government also adapted folk songs such as "Fight the Bandits," "Send Off the Elder Brother," "Sigh Five Watches," "Taiping Drum," and "New Kite Flying" to express the people's hatred for the troublemakers and to call on everyone to consolidate the northwest frontier, maintain local peace, and build a unified new China.</p>
<p>The Farmer's Day event was held on the 24th in front of the Martyrs' Shrine in Zhongshan Forest, with over 20,000 people participating. Afterwards, a great parade to suppress the rebellion was held, with all agencies, groups, national soldiers, self-defense forces, and all folk performances participating. This mighty flow went east from the Martyrs' Shrine, entered Zhongzheng Gate, and passed through Linsen Road, Yunting Road, and Zhonghua Road before disbanding in Central Square. At the same time, the Civil Education Hall also held a agricultural products exhibition. The poetry riddle society organized by local celebrities prepared over 5,000 riddle strips and thousands of prizes, which were hung at the south entrance of Drum Tower every night, attracting many people to guess.

<h3>Sui Province Combines Farmers' Day and Lantern Festival, Showing a Scene of Peace and Prosperity</h3>
<p>[Report from Gui Sui on the 25th] The Farmers' Day and Lantern Festival in Sui Province were combined, and yesterday the city of Gui Sui was filled with singing and dancing. The performances of the Four Townships and the various districts and departments totaled fifty units, and the procession on the streets stretched for ten miles. From 9:00 AM to 10:00 PM, vehicles could not pass. The movie theaters and theaters on the bustling streets performed three shows to entertain the farmers from the Four Townships, with each ticket costing 2,000 yuan. Lantern Festival customers still complained that it was not sweet enough. The 100,000 citizens almost forgot the situation in Chahar and Sui after the Asianization of the Northeast situation. According to the elders, this year's Lantern Festival is as enthusiastic as it was eleven years ago after the recovery of Bailing Temple and before the arrival of the Japanese invaders.</p>

<h3>After Deng Meikui Was Murdered, Xiao Xun and Others Petitioned for a Thorough Investigation</h3>
<p>[Report from Changsha on the 25th] The murder of Deng Meikui, a tenant farmer leader in Yiyang, has been of concern to Liu Xuru, Director of the Provincial Department of Social Affairs, and Xiao Xun, Director of the Land Administration Bureau. On the 23rd, they jointly telegraphed the Yiyang County Government and petitioned Chairman Wang to instruct on the direction of the investigation. Xiao told reporters: "Rent reduction is a struggle, and sacrifice in struggle is normal. However, Deng's sacrifice this time is too tragic. The rent reduction movement in Hunan may require several more bloodsheds to succeed, so Deng's death may not be without value."</p>
<h3>Arrest of Three Military Officers Stationed in Wuxi for Illegally Obtaining Military Rice</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Our Wuxi Correspondent, 24th] Cai Xiong, a warrant officer and special service chief of a certain unit stationed in Wuxi, a native of Fuling, Sichuan, 28 years old, lived an extravagant life and spent money recklessly. At the beginning of last month, he conspired with Zhu Qin, a sergeant clerk in the same company, and Zeng Jishen, a sergeant squad leader, to illegally obtain military rations. They immediately forged a notification form from the Joint Logistics Headquarters' Wuxi 367th sub-station and the station chief's seal. They prepared three forged forms, totaling 8,950 catties of medium-grade rice. Zeng and Zhu then went to the Minfeng Rice Mill, a rice distribution point entrusted by the Ximen sub-station, to collect the aforementioned military rice. At the beginning of this month, Zeng again independently collected 1,250 catties. It was not until the recent accounting that the matter was discovered. It was reported to the military police for investigation. The team arrested Cai and the other two culprits on separate days before yesterday. All confessed to the aforementioned facts. The military police team, believing that Cai and the others conspired to forge documents and seals and illegally obtain military rations, with conclusive evidence, prepared a document yesterday, along with relevant personnel, and submitted it to the regiment headquarters for transfer to the Nanjing Military Police Headquarters for legal action.</p>
<h3>Chu Tong Warship Bombards Remnant Bandits</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Our Jiangyin Correspondent, 24th] Recently, bandit activity in northern Jiangsu has been rampant. They intercept merchant ships on the Si Dunzi river surface in Jingjiang, disrupting water transportation. The Huaqian freighter, which was towing wooden boats from Hankou, and the Feitai freighter of the Deutai Company at the port were both robbed, further emboldening the bandits. At about 11:00 PM on the 23rd, the Chu Tong warship stationed in the port, in coordination with the land fortress troops, sent two naval squads, led by Deputy Commander Lin, aboard two merchant ships for patrol. As they approached the Si Dunzi river surface, they saw two civilian boats sailing out of the port, following them, attempting to rob them. The navy opened fire, killing six bandits in the boats. As the navy towed the captured bandit boats back, they were strafed by machine guns from the shore by bandit troops only a few miles away, who then pursued them by boat, creating a tense situation. The Chu Tong warship dispatched the No. 3 and No. 5 gunboats to join the battle. At the same time, the land fortress artillery also assisted in firing, and the two sides exchanged artillery fire in a fierce battle lasting two hours. The navy won a great victory. In this battle, one bandit soldier, Wang Xiaowenzi, was captured alive, six were killed, and one rifle and one automatic weapon were seized, as well as a large number of bandit tax receipts and resistance currency. At the time of the battle, the Jiangnan area was holding a grand lantern festival. Suddenly hearing the sound of gunfire nearby, the atmosphere became tense. The market continued as usual, but a curfew was imposed early to prevent accidents.</p>
<h3>New Trends in Hong Kong: Domestic Industries Relocate to Hong Kong to Find a Way Out; British Capital Flows to Australia for Development</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Our Hong Kong Correspondent, 22nd] Today can be said to be the season for impoverished Britons to engage in bountiful harvests. The following two news items were published simultaneously in the Hong Kong newspapers on the 20th of this month:</p>
<p>(1) Mr. Haliman, the former vice-chairman of the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, gave a speech in Sydney today, predicting that British capital will shift from Hong Kong to Australia... I have already transferred my private business to Australia.</p>
<p>(2) Industrialists from Shanghai are flocking to Hong Kong to establish large-scale factories. Recently, there are about fourteen or fifteen units, including seven yarn factories, which have already purchased land and are starting to build factories. Among those that have already started production after relocating from Shanghai, there are the Danan Yarn Factory and the Meiqi Chemical Factory. The larger-scale "Hong Kong Yarn Factory" is expected to start operations in about two months.</p>
<p>The Safest Country</p>
<p>These two news items reveal an important current trend in Hong Kong: domestic industries are moving to Hong Kong, and Hong Kong funds are moving to Australia. This article will briefly explain these two points.</p>
<p>Regarding the movement of British capital from Hong Kong to Australia, according to Haliman: Australia is the safest country. This is true not only in the Pacific region but also in the world. In a future Third World War, it may be impossible to find another place as safe as Australia. From an economic point of view, the value of the Australian pound is also quite strong. Australia has a vast land with a sparse population and abundant resources, so there is no need to worry about capital having "no place to use its heroism." Before the outbreak of the Pacific War, a large number of British women, children, and elderly people were evacuated from Hong Kong and China to Australia. After the war, although they returned to Hong Kong, that fertile land left a deep impression on them. Today, since they cannot stand their ground in mainland China, and with Britain facing austerity measures, the Middle East fraught with tension, India changing color, and Malaya in a precarious situation, Australia naturally becomes an ideal destination, apart from going to the unfamiliar Canada across the Pacific.</p>
<p>British People Sell Properties</p>
<p>As early as the beginning of 1947, British capital had already been quietly flowing out of Hong Kong. British people began selling their properties in Hong Kong and their shares in major public utilities or large commercial firms (they increased their original shares by four or five times, such as the tram company, which increased its capital from 2 million yuan to 10 million yuan, and then sold them). They absorbed a large amount of cash. Coincidentally, domestic capital was flowing into Hong Kong at that time, meeting their hungry appetites. According to estimates by people in Hong Kong's economic circles: in the past year, the proceeds from the sale of properties and shares in Hong Kong by British people amounted to approximately 50 million to 150 million yuan, of which at least half flowed into Australia.</p>
<p>Under the trend of British capital flowing out of Hong Kong, several large buildings in Central have changed hands. The Asia Building, which had its top floor bombed during the war, suddenly stopped construction while being rebuilt. However, not far from the Asia Building, a "Victory Building" has sprung up, and the Prince's Building diagonally opposite has added two floors. What a strong contrast! The relocation of domestic industries to Hong Kong can also be said to be domestic industries expanding to Hong Kong to find a way out, which has been evident since "August 23rd" (likely referring to the Second Taiwan Strait Crisis). The Meiya Silk Weaving Factory, Tianchu MSG Factory, Xinya Glass Factory, Jiehe Steel Factory, etc., have successively come to Hong Kong to open branch factories, which has caused the original industrialists in Hong Kong to look at them with new eyes.</p>
<p>A Glimpse of Emerging Industries</p>
<p>The emerging industries in Hong Kong after the war are mainly yarn factories. The Danan Yarn Factory, which has already started production, has 5,000 spindles and produces 12 bales of yarn per day. The Hong Kong Yarn Factory, which is about to start production, has 8,000 spindles and produces 18 bales of yarn per day. There are also two spinning factories that have been built and are undergoing registration, with even larger scales, each with 15,000 spindles and producing 30 bales of yarn per day. There are more than 300 large and small textile factories in Hong Kong, each needing about 4,000 to 5,000 bales of yarn per month. If those four yarn factories start production successively, they can supply the needs of Hong Kong's textile factories without relying on external sources. Opening yarn factories in Hong Kong has the convenience of raw materials and electricity, but there is a lack of skilled workers, and wages are also quite high. No wonder a domestic industrial magnate said: "Relocating Shanghai factories to Hong Kong is a last resort."</p>
<p>Factories Besides Yarn Factories</p>
<p>In addition to yarn factories, Hong Kong will also have large oil refineries, woolen yarn factories, chemical factories, glass factories, machinery factories, and shipyards appearing or being newly established. According to statistics in October last year, there were a total of 811 large and small factories that were granted factory licenses by the Hong Kong government. By January of this year, the number of registered large and small factories had increased to 1,207, with 923 located on the Kowloon Peninsula and 284 in Hong Kong. There are approximately 300 to 400 factories that have not yet been registered. This shows the considerable progress of light industry in Hong Kong after the war, and the main driving force behind it is the relocation of domestic industries, some of which are also the relocation of British industries in Shanghai.</p>
<p>A Win-Win Calculation</p>
<p>Our country's industries are moving to Hong Kong to find a way out, while British capital is flowing to Australia for development. On the surface, it is easy to misunderstand this as a preliminary sign of British people abandoning Hong Kong. However, the reality is not as pleasant as imagined. According to people familiar with the situation in Hong Kong, this move by the British is a strategy of retreating to advance. They have seen that China's human and financial resources have been pouring into Hong Kong with overwhelming force in the past two or three years. They are taking advantage of this "opportunistic moment" to use those abundant human and financial resources to develop this largest trading outlet in southern China, and even to decorate its beauty. They are handing over this task to the Chinese to manage themselves, while extracting their own strength to develop new targets. This is a win-win calculation.</p>
<p>A Central Policy</p>
<p>The current work of the Hong Kong government is mainly to maintain the stability of the Hong Kong dollar and the tranquility of social order. From the Hong Kong government's recent decision to expand urban construction plans to holding civil servant examinations and regulating school fees, tracing back to the initial period after Japan's surrender, how the Hong Kong government broke the market deadlock, how it distributed food, and how it restricted prices... all originated from a central policy, that is, to place Hong Kong under efficient administrative management, attract China's human and financial resources in turmoil, and operate and develop this last remaining stronghold of the British in China after a century of vicissitudes.</p>
<p>A foreign observer said that after the war, the British came to Hong Kong again as "housekeepers." Now that China's industrial circles are transferring to Hong Kong, and Hong Kong's British capital is flowing into Australia, it can be said to be the achievements of the "housekeepers'" hard work, and it can also be considered a bountiful harvest for the impoverished British in the Far East after the war!

<h3>Social Affairs Bureau Sold 13,000 Piculs of Rice Yesterday, but the Market Surge Has Not Abated.  Rice Sales Will Continue Until Full Rationing is Implemented.</h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent] Rice prices fluctuated again yesterday, and the Social Affairs Bureau resumed selling rice in the market. Director Wu said: The rice sales will continue until full rice rationing is implemented in March to reduce public panic. The food situation should improve after full rice rationing is implemented on March 1st. Rationing certificates are currently being printed around the clock by the Central Daily News using a drum printer and will be issued soon. Regarding the expansion of the Civil Food Distribution Committee, he discussed it with Mayor Wu yesterday morning. After the official document from the Executive Yuan arrives in the next few days, Ren Xianqun will formally take office as the chairman.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the amount of rice registered as arriving in the South Market was 2,581 piculs, and in the North Market, it was 1,261 piculs. Because the authorities enforced a price limit of 2.25 million yuan for market transactions and 2.4 million yuan for door-to-door sales, prices at the production areas were higher than in this city, so very little trading was done. Prices outside the market reached over 2.6 million yuan. The Social Affairs Bureau sold 12,989 piculs of rice in the market at a price of 2.25 million yuan, distributed to 2,075 rice stores. Therefore, off-market trading has not been eliminated, and prices continue to rise. The morning market yesterday was the strongest. White japonica rice once reached 2.6 million yuan, but later fell slightly to 2.55 million yuan. Thin indica rice was 2.5 million yuan, and early indica rice was 2.48 million yuan, each higher than the previous day by 50,000 to 60,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Flour</p>
<p>The opening was quite stable. Hongfeng Jiancheng flour initially saw a decline because the factory had made an offering the previous day, but it rebounded again due to the rise in rice prices. Bingchuan flour initially opened at 1.29 million yuan and then rose to 1.3 million yuan. Lao Che flour rose from 1.3 million yuan to 1.31 million yuan. Hongfeng Jiancheng also opened at 1.25 million yuan and closed at 1.28 million yuan, each rising by 10,000 to 20,000 yuan compared to the previous day. The market trend can be described as stable and strong. Wheat bran hovered at high prices. Fuxin large-package bran closed at 800,000 yuan, and the wheat factory priced it at 1.75 million yuan.</p>
<p>Cooking Oil</p>
<p>Trading only opened at the close due to the persistence of both buyers and sellers. Soybean oil was firm and had few sellers. Vegetable oil was relatively stable, with scattered sellers, and prices fell slightly. The three factories of Dayou, Dachang, and Changde jointly offered 300 units of soybean oil, and there were still many unsatisfied buyers. The price remained at 5.9 million yuan. Jitong vegetable oil was approximately 100,000 yuan lower, opening at 6.5 million yuan, but the later market was very strong. Other cooking oils were rarely offered. Recycled vegetable oil was 5.8 million yuan, and small-batch sesame oil was stable. Soybean cakes initially fell and then rose.</p>
<p>Grains</p>
<p>Varied greatly. Corn was the most popular. The price of soybeans had risen excessively for days. Although merchant groups were bidding, they were still hesitant, and there were not a few sellers taking advantage of the high prices to sell. Hankou Zha soybeans opened in the morning at 1.5 million yuan, down 100,000 yuan. The downward trend became even weaker after entering the market, falling to 1.45 million yuan. Finally, due to the rebound in oil prices and soybean cakes, it rose again to 1.5 million yuan. Although the Tianjin merchant group did not bid for sesame, the sellers were also unwilling to sell at low prices. Jiujiang milk sesame opened at 2.9 million yuan, a slight decrease of 50,000 yuan. Hankou secondary white sesame opened at 3.25 million yuan. Shelled peanuts were absorbed by the Guangdong merchant group and rose slightly by 50,000 yuan. The Qingdao merchant group continuously made progress in corn, and the inventory in this city was not abundant. Qidong corn set a new record of 2 million yuan, an increase of 150,000 yuan. Red sorghum was slightly more expensive by 30,000 to 50,000 yuan, and green beans were average.</p>

<h3>Cotton Yarn Distribution Method: Yarn Control Committee Changes Implementation; Prices to Be Self-Reported by Applicants</h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent] China Textile Construction Company received a notice from the Yarn Control Committee yesterday stating that, starting today (the 25th), the prices of distributed yarn will be temporarily self-reported by the applicant users, and the Textile Construction Company will approve them with reference to market conditions. The quota for each buyer will still be handled according to the original amount.</p>
<p>The total number of cotton yarn sold yesterday, including the Yarn Control Committee and the Textile Construction Company, reached 4,448 bales, equivalent to 5,462 bales of 20-count yarn, recovering a total of 300 billion yuan in cash. Of the yarns sold, 2,850 bales were sold by the Textile Construction Company at posted prices, equivalent to 2,850 bales of 20-count yarn, with 655 application forms. A total of 1,598 bales were sold by the Textile Construction Company on behalf of the Yarn Control Committee, equivalent to 2,081 bales of 20-count yarn, with 288 application forms.</p>
<p>The opening prices for each count of yarn were: 12-count Nikko 26 million yuan, 8-count Guang 33.5 million yuan, 10-count Lima Deputy Blue Phoenix 36 million yuan, 20-count Hongfeng 58 million yuan to Dafang 62.1 million yuan. 31-count Xiantao 82.5 million yuan, 31-count Twisted Xiantao 86.5 million yuan, 40-count Lam Fung 85 million yuan, 40-count K Caiqiu 90 million yuan, 42-count Double-Strand Shuiyue 92 million yuan, 60-count Nikko 165 million yuan.</p>
<p>Market Chaos</p>
<p>Also reported: The Textile Construction Company's sale of distributed yarn yesterday caused a stalemate due to pricing issues. The cotton yarn market yesterday was extremely chaotic. The Economic Section of the Police Bureau increased the number of economic police officers to closely monitor the market. The Yarn Control Committee also sold 16 types of cotton yarn in the market, but the shouting prices were still extremely chaotic. The price of 42-count yarn was shouted up to a high of 120 million yuan, while the price of 21-count yarn was reduced to more than 70 million yuan.</p>
<p>Yarn Prices Soar</p>
<p>The cotton yarn market situation yesterday was due to soaring raw cotton prices and scarce factory supply. Although the Textile Construction Company repeatedly posted prices, the public was strongly bullish, and various groups absorbed the yarn as soon as it was sold. Only the sound of buying was heard in the market, and there were very few sellers. With too little congee and too many monks, the market once again frantically soared upwards.</p>
<p>The initial opening price of 42-count Blue Phoenix fine yarn jumped by 19 million yuan, breaking through the 100 million yuan mark to 108 million yuan. Subsequently, short squeezes occurred, and floor traders took the opportunity to trade, creating a new record high of 112 million yuan. Near the close, many floating profits were sold, and the price fell slightly, closing at 105 million yuan, a huge increase of 16 million yuan compared to the previous day. In addition, the prices of various counts of coarse and fine yarn also rose sharply, setting new records again.</p>
<p>Cotton Cloth Gallops</p>
<p>The cotton cloth market situation was initially stable under the supervision of the authorities, and there was no significant activity between buyers and sellers. Very little trading was done in the market. It was then heard that northern groups were absorbing outside the market, and Changjiang groups were also making inroads. Furthermore, the fine cloth and serge supplied by the Textile Construction Company on alternating days were distributed by number. With raw cotton stocks depleted and prices high, floating funds from outside ports gathered in Shanghai, dyeing factories imported more and exported less, and the local cloth produced by the local factories in the four rural districts had excellent outlets. There were also entrants from outside the industry, creating a situation of galloping prices. As a result, the prices of 12-pound fine cloth of various brands jumped by more than 300,000 yuan compared to the previous day. In addition, serge, Zhiguan cloth, and Shilin cloth also set new highs.</p>
<h3>Distribution of Cotton Yarn to Replicating Industries to Adopt Quotation and Approval Method</h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent] Yesterday, the market price of yarn and cloth continued to rise sharply. A responsible person from the Yarn Control Committee recently stated that the prices of various commodities have been rising recently, and the price of yarn and cloth has risen more sharply this time because it has been suppressed too much in the past few days. In order to stabilize the rising trend, the committee has, in addition to publicly announcing the temporary suspension of cotton yarn transportation to the south, also urged the Textile Construction Company to continuously sell cotton yarn in the cotton yarn market every day. However, in the past, the Textile Construction Company opened sales of cotton yarn to the cotton yarn replicating industry every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday, all based on negotiated prices. This negotiated price is still the method set by the former Textile Control Committee. Currently, the negotiated price for each bale of 20-count yarn is 45.7 million yuan, while the market price for each bale is 67.8 million yuan, a difference of more than 20 million yuan. The cost of production has also exceeded the negotiated price significantly. However, the cloth woven by the replicating industry using cotton yarn distributed at the negotiated price is still sold at the market price. Therefore, yarn production factories suffer losses that do not cover costs, and in fact, it has not been possible to achieve the effect of stabilizing yarn and cloth prices. After careful consideration by the committee and approval by Minister Chen of the Ministry of Economic Affairs, it has been decided that, starting from the 25th of this month, the distribution of cotton yarn to the replicating industry will adopt the quotation and approval method. The Textile Construction Company will still distribute as much as possible according to the original amount.</p>
<h3>Cotton Textile Exports Can Apply for Exchange of Raw Materials</h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent] The central task of the Export Control Committee this year has been determined to be the promotion of exports and the acquisition of foreign exchange. To this end, the committee has convened representatives from relevant industries to discuss implementation methods. Discussions have been held with representatives of the cotton textile industry on the previous two days, as the industry has the greatest hope for exports, especially to various parts of Southeast Asia. Cotton textile industry insiders, because the Export Control Committee has established a method for exchanging raw materials for exported products, and the China Trust Bureau also has a method for exchanging yarn for exported products, have raised the question of whether they can still exchange yarn if there is a surplus of raw materials exchanged for exported products. After discussion, it was considered that they can apply separately.</p>
<h3>Silk Rises Again</h3>
<p>The artificial silk market rose sharply again yesterday. The opening price of 120-count Asahi Brand glossy silk in the morning was raised to 55 million yuan, but there were very few transactions due to the high price. The closing price at noon retreated to 48 million yuan. In the afternoon, it once fell to 45 million yuan, but finally rose to a selling price of 49 million yuan.</p>
<p>Although factories have distributed some, the quantity is very small, so the market price has not been suppressed. Yesterday's market price for Grade C silk was 60 million yuan, high grade others 55 million yuan, and ordinary dry grade others 22 million yuan, with some trading done. The market situation remained stable in the afternoon, with asking prices similar to the morning.</p>
<p>The silk goods market rose sharply yesterday. Due to the soaring raw materials and the sharp increase in costs, factory prices were raised one after another. Huaqiang silk bed sheets rose the most to 63 million yuan, and the closing price fell to 62 million yuan for immediate delivery. Dachang checkered crepe rose the most to 280,000 yuan, and the closing price was 275,000 yuan. The prices of other goods also increased by 5% to 8%.</p>
<h3>Tea Market Deserted</h3>
<p>The tea market still remained deserted as holders clung to their goods, pushing asking prices higher, and showing a latent bullish trend. Transactions, however, were still sparse. The reason seems to be that exporters found the asking prices too high and stopped buying. As for domestic varieties, local and outside buyers were interested, but the scarcity of supply prevented them from buying at will. Only small quantities were traded.</p>
<h3>Large Purchase of Chinese Stocks, Many Small Stocks Hitting Limit Up</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the buying of Chinese stocks was strong. Non-industry floating capital returned, and off-market stimulus increased, with new prices emerging one after another. As the yarn market was closed, small stocks became even more profitable. More than ten stocks, including Jinglun National Goods, Xinguang, and Jingfu, all hit their limit up.</p>
<p>Although market sentiment was good in the early morning, it was slightly dampened by the news of crackdowns on off-market trading. Jinglun's new shares were listed and eagerly bought by both industry insiders and outsiders, immediately rising to the limit. Yongsha spot and forward were both listed at a price of 1,000 yuan. Stocks such as No. 9 were sold for immediate delivery, and stocks such as No. 178 were sold for forward delivery, retreating to low prices of 985 yuan and 983 yuan. Spot and forward were inverted. Stocks such as No. 197 were eagerly bought for immediate delivery, and No. 78 was bought for forward delivery. The off-market interest rate fell to 0.21 yuan and 0.255 yuan, rising to 1,045 yuan and 1,040 yuan. Mr. Gong decisively took short positions, and off-market trading fell first. No. 178 and others sold for immediate delivery while prices were high, and No. 8 returned for delivery, retreating to 1,025 yuan and 1,015 yuan. However, Hong Kong Electric plummeted, and the black market surge arose, stirring up market sentiment again. Small stocks also rose across the board, performing exceptionally well. No. 231 and others went long for immediate delivery, and No. 12 went long for forward delivery, rising to new high prices of 1,065 yuan and 1,070 yuan. Banks such as No. 220 sold forward deliveries while prices were high, and also sold some small stocks. Yongsha closed in the morning at 1,060 yuan and 1,065 yuan. Jinglun, Zhabei, Zhongfang, Hengfeng, and Yongye all reached their limit up. After Xinguang was suspended, it rebounded slightly. Compared with the previous close, Yongsha, Meiya, Xinhe, and Yonggong rose by half, and Xinguang rose by the limit, rebounding. In addition to Zhabei, Jinglun, Zhongfang, Tongyi, Yongye, and Hengfeng rising to the limit, the remaining stocks rose by 10% to just under 20%. Forward delivery stocks rose by half for Yongsha, Xinhe, and Meiya, and the remaining stocks rose by slightly more than 10%.</p>
<p>In the after-market, forward deliveries were suspended as usual. Yongsha opened and rose to 1,070 yuan immediately. No. 218 and No. 103 advanced to 1,085 yuan. Nos. 8 and 9 sold, and a large trader named Zheng sold off-market, immediately falling slightly to 1,030 yuan. Nos. 188 and others took advantage of the low prices to buy in. However, due to the poor performance of the national banks, prices rose and mostly plateaued, rebounding to 1,060 yuan. Nos. 76 and others sold, falling to 1,015 yuan. Nos. 202 and others bought forcefully, and the closing price rose to 1,040 yuan. Jinglun National Goods and Lian'an still reached their limit up. Datong, Xinguang, Zhongfa, Zhabei, Jingfu, Yongye, and Huaqi were suspended and rebounded. Compared with the morning close, National Goods, Lian'an, Jinglun, and Yongye reached their limit up. Zhabei, Xinguang, Jingfu, Zhongfa, Huaqi, Xinrong, Rongchang, and Datong were suspended and rebounded. There were varying degrees of gains and losses, and the remaining stocks fell slightly. Various unlisted stocks in the off-market market were generally prosperous, rising by slightly more than 10%.</p>
<p>Tongyi Yarn Factory will begin issuing dividends on March 1st. The market opened for ex-dividend trading before that date.</p>
<h3>Public Debt Rises, Foreign Stocks Surge Again</h3>
<p>Government bonds experienced significant gains yesterday. Type C Consolidated Bonds opened at 80,000 yuan in the morning, initially dropping from 89,000 to 82,000 yuan before rebounding to 92,000 yuan near closing, followed by a slight retreat. Compared to the previous closing, Types A, B, D, and E each rose by 5,000 yuan, while Type C surged by 9,000 yuan. Trading volume reached approximately 3 million yuan.</p>
<p>Foreign stocks continued their dramatic rise yesterday, fueled by the black market. Hong Kong Electric shares saw a sharp contraction in supply, leading to a surge in buying interest. Foreign firms, Cantonese merchants, and securities houses competed fiercely for purchases. Ewo Cotton Mills shares opened at 1.13 million yuan and soared to a new high of 1.25 million yuan before slightly retreating in the afternoon, still holding above the 1.2 million yuan mark. Trading in miscellaneous stocks was limited. Compared to the previous closing, Ewo Cotton Mills, British American Tobacco, Paper, and Telephone shares each rose by fifteen percent, with other stocks also experiencing gains of ten percent.</p>
<h3>Industrial Loan Review Results Submitted for Approval by the Four Banks Joint Office</h3>
<p>[Reported by Our Newspaper] The industrial loan review committee of the Four Banks Joint Office held a meeting here on the 23rd. It was decided to form three sub-committees to conduct specialized reviews, focusing on loan interest rates, deposits, and other aspects. These sub-committees held separate meetings yesterday to further discuss and study the issues, and conclusions have now been reached. Yesterday afternoon at 3:30 PM, the results were resubmitted to the industrial loan review committee for further review. The conclusions reached have been taken to Nanjing by Mr. Diao Peiran, Deputy Director of the Loan Committee of the Four Banks Joint Office. They will be combined with the results of the agricultural loan sub-committee and submitted to the Four Banks Board of Directors for approval next Thursday, and then presented to the Chairman for final approval. It is understood that loans will be available for export goods, essential goods for people's livelihood, transportation, public utilities, industrial and mining enterprises, and the production and transportation of salt. These loans will be provided through methods such as purchasing, placing orders, contract manufacturing, and collateralization. Discounting is expected to remain limited as a principle. Interest rates, except for a small portion that will maintain low rates, will largely be calculated based on market rates. The loan terms will also be shortened as much as possible.</p>
<h3>Cotton Mills Face Cotton Shortage, Remedial Measures Agreed Upon</h3>
<p>[Reported by Our Newspaper] The Cotton Spinning Association of Six Districts held its 103rd executive board meeting yesterday at noon. After discussion, it was agreed that the current rising cotton prices, coupled with a lack of cotton reserves in some mills making it difficult to provide assistance, was a cause for great concern. It was decided to send Wang Qiyu, Liu Jingji, Wang Zhuyi, and others to visit Chairman Yuan of the Cotton Control Commission to request guidance. The meeting resulted in the agreement of the following four measures: (1) The association will automatically report the actual cotton inventory of each mill and promptly compile the data. (2) If a cotton mill genuinely lacks cotton and urgently needs assistance, the Cotton Control Commission, after verifying the situation, may adopt a contract spinning approach to provide raw cotton in advance, ensuring that mills do not have to suspend production. (3) The association will immediately notify its member mills to refrain from independently purchasing cotton in Shanghai, to uphold the government's cotton purchasing regulations. (4) The Cotton Control Commission's Shanghai warehouse already has 300,000 to 400,000 dan of raw cotton, with a large quantity continuing to arrive, so there is no need to worry about shortages.</p>
<h3>Sugar Group Meeting Decides that the Ninth Period Taiwan Sugar Allocation Price Will No Longer Be Adjusted with Exchange Rate Fluctuations</h3>
<p>[Reported by Our Newspaper] The Sugar Group of the Municipal Price Evaluation Committee held a meeting yesterday and resolved that the winter relief donation attached to the Taiwan Sugar Company's sugar allocation, originally scheduled to end at the end of February of this year, will now be extended to April 15th. Furthermore, to expand the city's security funding, 60,000 yuan per dan will be collected from the Taiwan Sugar Company's ninth allocation onward.</p>
<p>Starting with the Taiwan Sugar Company's ninth sugar allocation, the allocation price will be readjusted, but future adjustments will not be based on fluctuations in the Taiwan dollar exchange rate. The profit margin for wholesalers will also be increased from 16 percent to 20 percent starting with the ninth sugar allocation. The readjusted prices for the ninth sugar allocation are as follows:</p>
<h3>Allocation Price Increased by 60%</h3>
<p>Another report: Yesterday, the sugar market was affected by the continuous depreciation of the Taiwan dollar, reaching 125 yuan. Therefore, the Taiwan Sugar Company also significantly adjusted the allocation price today, increasing it by approximately 40 to 60 percent. Adding other educational funds and security donations of 130,000 yuan, the price of red, white, and refined sugar all exceeded 2 million yuan. Rock sugar saw the largest increase, reaching 4.13 million yuan including additional funds. The highest grade of superfine white sugar was 2.78 million yuan, and the lowest grade of Taiwan refined sugar was 2.23 million yuan. The association's trading floor thus became even more bullish. Spot 24 coarse white sugar was priced at 4 million to 4.05 million yuan, and four-and-a-half cart white sugar was priced at 4.1 million to 4.15 million yuan. 20 medium sand white sugar was priced at 3.245 million to 3.3 million yuan.</p>
<p>Local sugar also followed suit. Shantou refined sugar opened at 2.53 million yuan, Xinghua white sugar at 3.63 million to 3.68 million yuan, Xinghua red sugar at 2.53 million yuan, Diao refined sugar at 2.48 million yuan, ordinary Hainan red sugar at 2.35 million yuan, and high-quality Hainan red sugar at 2.45 million yuan. Peruvian granulated sugar was priced at 3.7 million yuan. Warehouse receipt trading saw August futures rise by more than 100,000 yuan. However, September futures, due to the increased allocation price, saw initial tightness followed by softening, declining by 40,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>Financial Control Bureau Dispatches Personnel to Investigate the Financial Status of Insurance Companies</h3>
<p>[Reported by Our Newspaper] The Financial Control Bureau has dispatched personnel to investigate the use of funds by insurance companies. To understand the use of funds in the insurance industry and facilitate audits, the Ministry of Finance has formulated forms in accordance with the wartime insurance industry management regulations. The Shanghai Financial Control Bureau has ordered the industry association to comply and submit the completed forms within three days, and has dispatched personnel to conduct on-site investigations at various companies. In addition, the black market for gold banknotes has recently become rampant again, significantly impacting commodity prices. The Financial Control Bureau has decided to dispatch personnel to conduct secret investigations in conjunction with the Municipal Police Bureau, and those found to be involved will be severely punished.</p>
<h3>Paper Prices Surge Sharply</h3>
<p>The paper market is experiencing extreme scarcity of both available stock and incoming supplies. Further exacerbated by the easing of credit, various parties are actively seeking to procure paper, including those outside the industry, leading to continuous price increases. Yesterday, the surge was particularly pronounced. American white newsprint was selling for 3 million yuan upon leaving customs, soaring as high as 3.25 million yuan. Folio white newsprint was priced at 3.05 million yuan, representing a significant increase of 350,000 yuan each compared to the previous day. Colored white typing paper was priced at 4 million yuan outside customs, also reaching 4.5 million yuan for white and 4.2 million yuan for colored, soaring by 600,000 to 400,000 yuan. In addition, tracing paper, kraft paper, glassine paper, and other paper types also saw increases of 10 to 20 percent.</p>

<h3>Man and Medicine</h3>
<p>—Di Shan</p>
<p>Written by H.E. Sigerist, Translated by Qian Ji, Published by Commercial Press "This is a general treatise on medicine written using historical narrative. Each chapter is an interesting historical story." - Hu Shi's Preface</p>
<p>The author, H.E. Sigerist, is Swiss. He has lived in various countries and studied their history in detail. He is a person with an international perspective and broad vision. His early education was mostly obtained in France. His medical studies were conducted at the University of Zurich in his home country. He also studied at Johns Hopkins University for a period, thus establishing contact with British academic life. He later held the most important chair of medical history in all of Germany at the University of Leipzig. His book "Man and Medicine" was written in Leipzig. This book was originally a lecture given by the author to new medical students at the University of Leipzig each year, but the value and function of this book are not limited to medical students. Translations have been published in various countries around the world and are widely welcomed by readers.</p>
<p>The translation and publication of the Chinese version went through some twists and turns. In 1933, Gu Lin, acting president of Peking Union Medical College, discussed with Mr. Hu Shi the idea of finding someone to translate Dr. Sigerist's "Man and Medicine." Mr. Hu Shi originally hoped that the Foundation Compilation and Translation Committee could bear the translation costs. However, the committee did not have the resources at that time, so President Gu Lin personally bore the translation costs. Coincidentally, Gu Qianji, who studied agronomy, was willing to translate it, so the Chinese translation of this world-renowned masterpiece was able to be published.</p>
<p>The book is divided into seven parts, including knowledge of various aspects of man and medicine and medical history. The author's original manuscript was a lecture, so the language is easy to understand and fascinating. The translation is also clean and clear, making it easy to read.</p>
<p>The first chapter talks about man. He said, "The thoughts and actions of doctors always focus on man. All their efforts are to treat human diseases and find ways to prevent humans from getting sick." Regarding doctors, he said, "It is not enough for doctors to observe humans only from the perspective of natural science. Doctors should also study the unique position of man in the world and recognize him as an intelligent being. He must study the whole man and study the sum of man's life experience." Readers can be said to be deeply attracted by his writing when they read his entire book from the starting point of Sigerist's great love.</p>
<p>In the first chapter, "Man," he not only told us about the structure and function of the human body, but also told us the importance of "psychology and mind." He said, "Doctors should walk side by side with humans, hoping to know that an empty shell cannot give you the ability to treat and guide patients. This ability comes from a deep knowledge of man and life."</p>
<p>The second chapter talks about "The Patient." Sigerist traces the position of patients in cultural development from ancient times. He pointed out that the most thorough and decisive change in the status of patients was influenced by Christianity. This influence of liberating human suffering is really great. Christianity removed the stigma of sin from patients and made them free. From this article, we can clearly understand the historical evolution of the status of patients and know the position of patients in modern society.</p>
<p>Chapters three, four, five, and ten, including "The Symbol of Medicine," "Disease," and "Causes of Disease," can be said to be the most essential narratives in the book. The most important thing about the author is to point out the relationship between cultural development and historical evolution, and always respect the progress of man and medicine. How humans overcame all kinds of disease invasions, how humans struggled to protect human safety, and how humans used wisdom to invent all new treatments for diseases.</p>
<p>In the sixth chapter, "Treatment," Sigerist repeatedly pointed out all the situations, procedures, and methods that should be paid attention to in treatment. The last chapter talks about "Doctors." He tells us that the actions of doctors are not free. Doctors have their responsibilities, and this responsibility puts doctors under ordinary moral laws. Sigerist also quoted Paracelsus's words: "The origin of medicine is love," so he said: "Enthusiasm for helping people, love for mankind, and natural sacrifice are all contained in all medical ideals."</p>
<p>The biggest feature of this book is that it makes us understand the historical and cultural background of every new theory or new technology everywhere. It uses general culture as a canvas on which to draw a panoramic view of medicine. Mr. Hu Shi said well in his preface: "So we can say that this is a general treatise on medicine written using historical narrative. Each chapter is a narrative of history, a story, a very interesting historical story."</p>
<p>The translation was proofread and prefaced by Mr. Hu Shi. It was first published in 1935. It was not until last year that Commercial Press republished it in the "New Middle School Library," from which we can imagine that this book has not yet attracted the attention of many readers in our country. The author dares to introduce it, so that this great work becomes the reading of every intellectual, and further helps the vast illiterate population in our country who do not have new medical knowledge.</p>
<h3>Random Talks on Reading Interests</h3>
<p>— Mang</p>
<p>(Written by Du Zuozhou, etc., printed by China Cultural Service Society)</p>
<p>Reading is something that makes many readers feel pain. Although there are good reading methods and a suitable reading environment, it still makes people feel pain. Since reading is considered a painful thing, of course it will not tell people to read well. Even if they are forced to read, it will still have no effect. What is the reason for this? The biggest key is whether there is an interest in reading.</p>
<p>Reading is originally a happy thing in life. Readers can obtain truth and justice from books and learn about all the secrets of life. Therefore, many people who are interested in reading think about reading all the time. They are not happy without reading. Why do we not like reading instead? It is because we are not interested in reading. How can we make ourselves interested in reading? It seems to be a difficult problem, but it is not difficult to implement. Here is a book that will introduce you to this topic. The title of the book is "Random Talks on Reading Interests." It will show you how to cultivate your interest in reading.</p>
<p>"Random Talks on Reading Interests" is a small booklet of only eighty pages, containing more than twenty articles. The content is entirely about cultivating reading interests, reading methods, attitudes, etc. Each article is written by one or two people. They expressed their reading experience and reading methods, which are obviously of great help to readers. It seems to have value in introducing.</p>
<p>The first article is "On the Way of Learning." In just a few thousand words, it analyzes the methods and attitudes of learning clearly. It provides particularly correct guidance for people who generally read books by rote, read books by rote, and learn nothing for practical use. It has unique insights on the methods of learning, and it believes that the spirit of so-called "geniuses" who do not know how to work hard and give up on themselves is undesirable. It wants us to work harder!</p>
<p>For example, in the article "How to Cultivate Reading Interest," the author discusses it in detail and lists various points, such as: reading should be voluntary; understand the purpose of reading; reading should have a spirit of hard work and self-encouragement; reading should be both precise and broad; and other points are common problems for us readers. There are other detailed instructions on how to correct it.</p>
<p>For example, in "About Reading," the purpose of our reading, what books to read, and how to read are all explained and instructed. It also points out our problem of only relying on memory, not thinking, and not integrating reading. The current examination system in schools makes most students develop such habits. They only read books and listen to lectures in class, relying entirely on memory to cope with exams. The knowledge gained by rote memorization is thrown away after the exam. This is such a serious problem!</p>
<p>Other articles also have unique features. To avoid trouble, I will not list them one by one. Finally, several people wrote about the books they like to read and stated the reasons why they like to read them. For example, Zhou Yutong likes to read "New Learning and Pseudo-Classics Examination." Taking this book as a pivot, he grasped the dynamics of thousands of years of Chinese culture. For example, Hu Shanyuan likes to read "Brave Young Men" because there is a motto in it: "As long as you do things upright, don't ask about success or failure, profit or loss." Of course, there are more than just these two articles, and the others are omitted.</p>
<p>In short, this book is a very good guide in any case. It is of great benefit to people who are not interested in reading, even people who are interested in reading but have not yet succeeded. It not only gives instructions on reading methods and interest cultivation, but also involves what books should be read, the realm of reading, etc. It is indeed a beacon of guidance for readers! Therefore, people who have read this book should fulfill a responsibility, which is to introduce this book to those who are not interested in reading, so that they can get happiness from reading.</p>
<p>Do you want to make you interested in reading? Then, I advise you to read this book.</p>
<h3>[For the Next Generation]</h3>
<p>— Yi Xiu</p>
<p>Written by Mu Shaoliang, Published by Commercial Press, Price 2.50 yuan, 104 pages</p>
<p>Revitalizing national morality is indeed an extremely urgent task today. Before the war, we had the May Fourth New Culture Movement, the Old Morality Restoration Movement, and the New Life Movement. Today, we still need a movement to revitalize national morality. Among the targets of this movement, the most important are the young people whose blood is still uncertain. The so-called "youth are the masters of the country" and "youth are the pillars of the nation," if this generation of young people has morality, cultivation, public morality, a sense of right and wrong, and a sense of justice, then this generation of country has hope. In particular, most young people are pure, frank, and easily infected, so it is easier to accept and implement new moral concepts and moral awareness, and it is also particularly important. Therefore, for young people, I feel that this matter is not a "revitalization" at all, because bad young people have always been a very small minority.</p>
<p>This book is written in the style of letters. The table of contents includes "First Letter: Emerging from the Old" (on civic virtue), "Second Letter: Has Heaven Ever Distinguished Good and Evil?" (on good and evil and karma), "Third Letter: The Supreme Man Living in Isolation" (on the individual and society); "Fourth Letter: Be an Anonymous Hero" (on active and passive); "Fifth Letter: Starting from the Final Victory" (on loyalty and filial piety); "Sixth Letter: A Happy Family" (admonishing father and mother); "Seventh Letter: Virtues That Violate Human Nature" (on diligence and thrift); "Eighth Letter: Even if it's Zhuge Liang" (on fame and fortune), "Ninth Letter: Mark Twain and Cao Cao" (on the attitude of being a person), "Tenth Letter: How Should We Deal with People" (on dealing with the world and making friends); "Eleventh Letter: The Candle Burns to Ashes and Tears Dry" (on the meaning of work); "Twelfth Letter: Self-Improvement Without Ceasing" (on the attitude of work)</p>
<p>Looking at the table of contents above, I feel that the author has taken ancient and modern, Chinese and foreign, as topics. I don't know how he will deal with these mixed and chaotic things under a consistent moral view. This kind of writing is obviously laborious and unrewarding; if you are not careful, you may write a new-style "Taishang Ganying Pian." However, the author of this book, Mr. Mu Shaoliang, not only has profound and unique insights and thoughts, but also has a lively and humorous writing style; thoughts are enough to control the writing style, and the writing style can fully render thoughts. After reading this thin book of about seventy or eighty thousand words, I only feel relaxed and happy, but also full of strength. It is definitely not as headache-inducing as the general books of persuasion and correction, and even if you reluctantly finish reading it, it is tasteless. In the twelve letters, the author tells various moral issues in a gentle and earnest manner, in a simple and profound way, and the aftertaste is extremely meaningful. What is even more gratifying is that the content focuses on fun and is not glib, talking about principles and popularizing them, without rigid dogmas and without shocking high-level arguments. Every word and every word starts from practical things, which is both easy to understand and practical. There is absolutely no unrealistic empty talk. It is indeed a good work worth recommending!</p>
<p>The author has given a new interpretation to some of the old Chinese morality (such as the four dimensions and eight virtues, etc.), discarding the unreasonable, outdated, conservative and decadent parts, and at the same time injecting some new and progressive social morality. The processing is very appropriate. In the whole book, in addition to expounding his consistent theory, you can also find many of the author's insightful original ideas.</p>
<p>The biggest feature of this book is that it fits the current reality and provides kind and interesting guidance to young people. It is based on reality, and critiques and criticizes reality. It does not extravagantly talk about how beautiful the future will be and what kind of perfect moral cultivation needs to be established in that future. He does not sing high-profile (but not out of date), and always grasps reality, which is extremely important. As for the form of writing letters, it is also worth learning for young people; the author narrates in a fascinating, organized, tactful and circuitous way, using a beautiful and fluent writing style, which makes the readers very happy.</p>
<p>It is easy to write this kind of book, but it is difficult to write it well. At the same time, everyone has different opinions, and criticism is extremely difficult, but this book has no shortcomings in this regard. If there are any shortcomings in this book, then it seems that the scope is not large enough and the aspects are not broad enough (for example, this book does not mention the issue of love, how important this issue is to young people!). According to the author's speculation, the author can continue to write the thirteenth and fourteenth letters in a series, and gradually put forward and discuss guidance on issues such as love, which will be of greater benefit to young people.</p>
<p>In today's lack of good books on moral cultivation, I would like to recommend this book to young people across the country.</p>
<h3>George Bernard Shaw Travels to Soviet Russia</h3>
<p>It is reported that Xiao Min is now ninety-two years old and no longer makes long trips. This is a photo taken at the Berlin train station on his way to the Soviet Union at the age of seventy-five. Shaw smiled and told reporters, "Every time I take a photo, I have to pay me two shillings."</p>
<h3>The Last Critical Moment for Americans in China</h3>
<p>— Lin Jing</p>
<p>Original by Freda Utley, Translated by Hua Jun Gang</p>
<p>Published by Minzhi Publishing House, Distributed by Shanghai Fuzhou Road Independent Publishing House</p>
<p>In the very first chapter, the author states, "I want to write a book about China, and I want to write it without any bias. Bias is inevitable, but I do have some bias towards communism and democracy." From this statement, we already know that this author wants to say a few fair words for China's advocates of the People's Livelihood Principle.</p>
<p>In the conclusion, she quotes Hitler: "The bigger the lie, the more people believe it. People love lies. But if one ends up deceiving oneself, that is very dangerous. For many years, magazines have been filled with articles by propagandists. Although what they wrote was completely false and lying, it was still loved by the people. Magazines only care about sales, and they don't care about the truth." This shows how much she hates those who distort the truth.</p>
<p>China and the Chinese People</p>
<p>She believes that "to criticize Chinese politics, one must first understand its historical background and actual situation. China's current problem is how to seek unification and strength without abandoning the path of democracy, how to complete reforms that require one or two hundred years within one or two decades, and without using terror and violence. In China, there remains a kind of gentle, old-century morality. The Chinese have a strong sense of individual dignity and freedom. Any foreigner who comes to China will find the social democracy between people there to be different. People of completely different classes, rich, poor, officials, merchants, scholars, workers, or farmers, they can all talk freely, and even the lowest profession will not feel like slaves. Although they are poor, they do their own thing and never lose their self-esteem. The Chinese, at least in spirit, are very free. The Chinese need genuine assistance and practical, constructive advice, but they do not need condescending lessons. We must recognize that today's China is weak due to the deep damage suffered during the eight-year war of resistance and the wanton destruction by the communists. If the United States clearly states its support for China, this will be of great help to China. If China, with our help, becomes a democratic power, it will be of great benefit to the free world."</p>
<p>Fighting Alone for Democracy</p>
<p>Her conclusions are:</p>
<p>(1) China must be supported and no longer be allowed to independently hold this frontline of world strategy. If the United States does not want China to be swallowed by the Communist Party, it must fully support it so that it no longer fights alone for democratic countries.</p>
<p>(2) Economically, we must understand that today's US aid to China, although much larger than the aid before the war, is still not enough given the vastness of its territory, the size of its population, and the heavy tasks of post-war reconstruction and reform. US aid must truly be effective for the situation to improve. The money needed to restore China's productive forces is proportionally much smaller than that needed in Europe. In total, about twenty to thirty billion US dollars of aid would be sufficient.</p>
<p>"The United States must not be deceived and must abandon its ambivalent and contradictory policies and adopt a firm, far-sighted, and statesmanlike policy to use American power and influence.</p>
<p>"The Americans in China are now at a critical moment. This critical moment may last for a considerable period, but in any case, the later it gets, the worse the situation will be. Now, we must immediately re-equip the Chinese government's army and support patriotic Chinese people to contain those foreign-flattering elements who want to drag China into the Soviet sphere. Now is the best time for all of this. History, of course, may have many twists and turns. I am not a prophet and cannot point out which day or which is truly the critical moment. But I feel without a doubt that the fate of China and our fate will be determined in the near future."</p>
<p>The author is a Far East expert, a famous reporter. "Japan's Impasse" was her previous book, and during the Japanese invasion, she called on the United States to aid China. Now she is calling for aid to China again to prevent it from being invaded again.</p>
<h3>Reading [Biography of Shaw]</h3>
<p>— Bu Shu</p>
<p>Written by Hesketh Pearson, Translated by Huang Jia De</p>
<p>"He is a standard resident of the earth... once called the Voltaire of the twentieth century, but will undoubtedly become the Voltaire of the twenty-first and twenty-second centuries as well."</p>
<p>Last August 26th was Shaw's 90th birthday, and newspapers and magazines around the world published commemorative articles. I believe that the commentary in Soviet E. Yarmolov's "Mischief in Literature" is the most pertinent and insightful. (This article was later translated by Mr. He Jia Huai and published in the "Sunday Literary" section of the Ta Kung Pao on November 23rd of this year.) Recently, after reading Hesketh Pearson's "Biography of Shaw," I naturally have a deeper understanding of Shaw's love of "jokes," but I still agree with E. Yarmolov's words: "Shaw is a standard resident of the earth."</p>
<p>Hesketh Pearson was a close friend of Shaw and worked with Shaw in journalism, but more often, he appeared as a "sexual psychologist." Before Hesketh Pearson wrote "Biography of Shaw," Shaw repeatedly expressed his opposition, but eventually provided materials and opinions. After Hesketh Pearson's death, Shaw himself proofread the entire manuscript. He said that he did not agree with Hesketh Pearson's opinions, but also believed that Hesketh Pearson had his own views. If this book is regarded as a chapter in the biography of Shaw, "Shaw's Opinions on Gender Issues" or "Shaw's Sexual History," he agrees with Hesketh Pearson's writing.</p>
<p>What the entire "Biography of Shaw" highlights may not be the real Shaw, but the Shaw in Hesketh Pearson's eyes, but if we admit that Hesketh Pearson has keen insight and uncompromising vision, then looking out from Hesketh Pearson's perspective, we can see some aspects of Shaw. These embarrassing aspects cannot be seen in G.K. Chesterton's "A Critical Study of Shaw" and S.C. San Gupta's "The Art of Bernard Shaw." Hesketh Pearson has written many biographies, and even a biography of Shakespeare. His views are inevitably biased, but it cannot be said that he has no insight. The same is true of his writing of "Biography of Shaw." In this biography, he ignored what most people value and valued what most people ignore, such as the chapters "Shaw's Women" and "Shaw's Views on Gender," which can be said to have not been explored by anyone before Hesketh Pearson, so these chapters can also be said to be the most surprising in the entire book.</p>
<p>But this is not to say that apart from gender issues, this biography is not worth reading. The fact is that among the authors of Shaw's biographies, Hesketh Pearson is perhaps the most critical. In Chapter 10, "Shaw's Socialism," Hesketh Pearson has extremely profound criticism of Shaw's thought and spirit. He denies that Shaw is a philosopher because he does not have his own system of thought; he also criticizes Shaw's wavering stance during the First European War, saying that he sometimes wanted to form an alliance with Romain Rolland and others, standing on the position of a "world citizen" to oppose the war, and at other times he became a thorough nationalist. In Chapter 18, "Technique," and Chapter 19, "Greater Than Shakespeare?" he has subtle criticisms of Shaw's playwriting techniques and also denies his style of lacking momentum. These criticisms are all insightful and are not in the tone of a general peacemaker. This is why Hesketh Pearson was always able to be Shaw's critical friend.</p>
<p>Because Shaw worked with Hesketh Pearson for a considerable period of time when he was young, and Shaw's writing career and Hesketh Pearson's magazine career were often intertwined, Hesketh Pearson is more familiar with Shaw's struggles in his youth. From Chapter 2, "Ireland in the 1860s," to Chapter 8, "The Destitute Years in London," all that is written is Shaw's struggle, but everywhere there is Hesketh Pearson's commentary and annotation, and his views are by no means as vulgar as those of general biographers.</p>
<p>What is particularly valuable is that in the preface to "Biography of Shaw," there are several letters from Shaw to Hesketh Pearson, talking about his own past life, which are extremely important historical materials in the literary world. The final "Postscript" is Shaw's opinion on this biography after proofreading the entire text, and the main point is to discuss Hesketh Pearson's personality and works, so it can also be read as "Shaw's Essay on Hesketh Pearson." Shaw's "Postscript" is written quite wittily, and its humor is no less than that of the frank confession attached to Chapter 17, "Shaw's Views on Gender."</p>
<p>Shaw is witty and frank, and his only strength is that he is willing to tell the truth to anyone, but his truth is often taken as a joke. So in the end, he regarded himself as "the world's greatest joke merchant." He said that the objects of his "jokes" are all the ordinary things that people ignore, and that because he said them in a more frank way, they are considered ridiculous. In replying to Tolstoy's letter责备 him for loving to laugh, he once said the following:</p>
<p>"Why should humor and laughter be subject to prohibited punishment? Supposing that this world is in fact just a joke by God, then are you going to give up the effort to turn it from a bad joke into a good joke?"</p>
<p>Therefore, even when he admits that he is a joke merchant, he is not a person who "jokes for the sake of joking." He is a great man who wants to turn bad jokes into good jokes, and "humor" is just his tool or means. He is not as leisurely as our joke artisans.</p>
<p>Shaw is a socialist, a Fabian, a pacifist, a vegetarian, an abstainer... but in fact, he is also a great contradiction: he supports war and opposes war; supports democracy and opposes parliament; supports evolution and opposes Darwin; supports nationalism and opposes patriotism; supports the chastity and restraint of men and women and opposes censorship. In his plays and novels, too, two Shaws are revealed:</p>
<p>"These Shaws cannot agree on how to win a 'good, comfortable life.' One of them has very clearly pointed out in his works: in order for people to live rationally, it is necessary to transform the social environment first. This Shaw wrote some 'unpleasant' plays. But the other Shaw wants us to first transform ourselves if we want to make life meaningful and valuable; this Shaw loves to write plays about abnormal physiology. This 'unpleasant' Shaw is a realist and a socialist. The Shaw who loves to write plays about abnormal physiology is an idealist. This 'unpleasant' Shaw is a destroyer of idols; but the other abnormal physiologist is a 'believer in the Life Force.'" (E. Yarmolov)</p>
<p>By dissecting Shaw in this way—one side being a realist and the other being an idealist; one side being a fighter and the other being a compromiser—we may be able to get closer to his soul. Everyone has their inner struggles, and these struggles do not detract from his greatness, because he is a man, not a god. As a man, Shaw is blameless; and Hesketh Pearson's "Biography of Shaw" contains many records of this "man" in his struggles in modern society.</p>

<h3>Exploring Plum Blossoms Indoors</h3>
<p>— He Ku</p>
<p>When spring just revealed a bit of news, according to people from Hangzhou, tourists on vacation had already poured in, with the goal of going to Gushan to see plum blossoms. When the plum blossoms had already begun to bloom, I could see that when I walked through the Wangping Street area on Lunar New Year's Eve. There, a large number of flower vendors were selling Nandina, wintersweet, as well as potted red and green plum blossoms, and potted pine, bamboo, and plum—the Three Friends of Winter—etc. Thus, I guessed that areas known for their plum blossoms, such as Gushan, Chaoshan, Dengwei, and Meiyuan, must at this time be competing in beauty, using cold loneliness to report the arrival of spring.</p>
<p>But living in Shanghai is really too difficult. There is no scenic area in the suburbs where one can explore plum blossoms. Perhaps this is the reason why the vulgar cannot tolerate the elegant. If one goes to my hometown of Dengwei, plum trees are everywhere. In the corners of fields and houses, one can see one or two trees. Once one enters the mountains and fields, the fragrance of plum blossoms is sent from the breeze everywhere. One does not have to run to Xiangxuehai to admire the plum blossoms. In fact, exploring plum blossoms does not have to be counted as an elegant affair. People have a natural tendency to move to nature, especially those who are used to mixing in the city. Who doesn't want to go out to breathe the air and change the turbid environment? It's just that the constraints of life are too great, and there is no chance to travel, so the matter of exploring plum blossoms can only be left to idlers as an elegant affair.</p>
<p>However, even if you don't travel, someone will break off branches of plum blossoms from the suburbs and sell them in the small vegetable market. I bought a bunch back and placed them in a vase, as if it were a plum forest. Since I can't go to Chaoshan Dengwei to explore plum blossoms, why not explore plum blossoms in the room? Moreover, the ancients have said, "Fragrance of flowers is not in quantity." Having a bottle of plum blossoms is enough for my dream to wander in Xiangxuehai. I have this optimistic spirit of "quenching thirst by looking at plum blossoms."</p>
<p>In the past, people spent the poor year on New Year's Eve, hearing the firecrackers and seeing the red candlelight in other people's homes, while their own houses were cold and clear. So they wrote a poem to console themselves, ending with the line: "I inserted plum blossoms and spent the new year." I cannot go to the famous scenic areas of Jiangnan to explore plum blossoms, and can only wander in my small room, admiring the plum blossoms, applying the old sentence of the ancients for comparison, and it is nothing more than "I inserted plum blossoms and explored spring."</p>
<h3>Visiting Mr. Feng Zikai</h3>
<p>— Feng Ren</p>
<p>One rainy afternoon, Mr. Yu Sheng and I went to visit Mr. Feng Zikai. We went to Zhaoxian Temple in West Lake, turned a bay to the left, and saw a small Chinese-style house with two swinging doors opening to the road. We walked into the parlor, and Mr. Yu Sheng called out, "Mr. Feng, there are guests to see you."</p>
<p>"Ah, I'm washing my feet," came a cheerful and pleasant voice from inside. Soon, Mr. Feng came out without properly dressed, and after urging me to sit down, everyone started talking casually.</p>
<p>Naturally, we talked about Mr. Feng's paintings. He said, "My paintings are all fabricated. I look at a living tree and treat it as a painting post." This is actually creation, but Mr. Feng politely said it was "fabricated." Mr. Feng's paintings have long lived in the hearts of millions of readers, and there is no need for me to praise them. I said, "I like Mr. Feng's essays as much as his paintings!" He said politely again, "I'm ashamed, I'm ashamed. I'm very lazy, and I haven't written articles for a long time, because writing articles is more laborious. Articles need to be deep, while paintings are flat." I asked, "Does Mr. Feng still go to Zhejiang University to teach?" He smiled and said, "Selling paintings can barely make a living, and I'm too lazy to teach."</p>
<p>Mr. Feng asked about my hometown. I said it was in the countryside of Shaoxing. He asked which part of the countryside, and I said Gaobu. He said, "Do you know Zhang Xichen, the boss of Kaiming? He is also from the countryside of Shaoxing—Mashan." I said, "I know a little bit. Mashan is not far from my home." He told me very kindly, "Mr. Zhang has gone home. He is visiting his mother's illness. His mother is over eighty years old."</p>
<p>Finally, we said goodbye and came out. He insisted on seeing us off, and I stopped him, saying, "The ground is wet." When we walked out of the gate, we still saw him standing at the door of the parlor, smiling kindly and saying, "Come again when it's sunny."</p>
<p>Among the many visits to "celebrities," this was the most pleasant. It was like meeting a long-lost elder, a kind of warm feeling that will always remain in my heart.</p>
<h3>Rice Can Cure Diseases</h3>
<p>— Guo Ping</p>
<p>In today's world, rice can not only satisfy hunger; it can also cure diseases. Perhaps most people can only agree with the first half of the sentence, and they will definitely not believe the second half, or at least they will be skeptical. However, in fact, rice has also become a kind of medicine today, because rice can cure hypertension.</p>
<p>Canadian Dr. Ashley De Valois, seeing that the British people suffered from peptic ulcers particularly during air raids in wartime, began to study the cause. As a result, he found that peptic ulcers could cause people to suffer from hypertension. Dr. De Valois then tested what kind of drugs could cure hypertension and finally found that foods with low protein and salt and high in sugar were effective, which coincided with the principle discovered by Dr. Kempner of Duke University that "rice" can cure hypertension, because rice is a food with low protein and salt. Dr. Kempner once published in newspapers that the Chinese food—rice—has indeed been able to cure hypertension for thousands of years. Perhaps someone will ask, don't the Chinese have anyone who dies of stroke or arteriosclerosis due to hypertension? Dr. De Valois then published a simple and accurate theorem: "If you have a bowl of rice or a piece of chocolate candy in your body, rather than a glass of milk or a steak, then you can avoid hypertension and increase your life." It can be seen that if you eat more meat and fatty foods, you may have the possibility of suffering from hypertension.</p>
<p>One of Dr. Kempner's patients was a 32-year-old woman who suffered from severe hypertension after giving birth to her tenth child. She had 250 heart contractions and 174 heart dilations. When she arrived at the doctor's office, she was almost fainting to death, and was unconscious for several hours. But she was eventually cured. After that, Dr. Kempner published an article in the "New York Medical Bulletin" saying that he believed that the only savior for this woman was to absolutely eat "rice food," such as rice, porridge, etc., followed by some sugar, fruit, and fruit juice. After two periods of this method of treatment, her blood pressure dropped from 250 heart contractions to 156. On the 52nd day, she was the same as the standard of normal people in every aspect.</p>
<p>Kempner proved that 130 out of 213 patients were cured by eating rice foods, and only 75 patients did not improve. Before there is a specific medicine for hypertension in the medical community, the efficacy of rice can be said to be "second to none."</p>
<p>Today, Americans have recognized that rice is the only hope for people with hypertension. In the near future, rice may become one of the main foods in the United States.</p>
<h3>Ill-Omened Person</h3>
<p>— Wu Jiu</p>
<p>On the night of April 14, 1865, US President Lincoln was sitting in the box of Ford's Theater watching a play. Suddenly, John Wilkes Booth, a disgruntled actor, appeared in the shadows. He entered the president's box and shot the president in the head. The president's attendants and theater staff immediately carried the president to a small room in a house across the street to rest. At 7:22 the next morning, the president died of his injuries.</p>
<p>At the time of the president's death, about twenty-five people were serving by his side, and standing next to the president was the president's eldest son, Robert Todd Lincoln.</p>
<p>At this time, everyone already knew that the murderer was the younger brother of Edwin Booth, a famous contemporary actor.</p>
<p>Sixteen years later, on July 2, 1881, President Garfield walked into the waiting room of the Washington, D.C., train station, preparing to travel to New England. An uninvited guest suddenly emerged from the crowd, named Charles Guiteau. As soon as he saw the president, he pulled out a pistol and fired two fatal shots at the president.</p>
<p>Lincoln's son was one of the witnesses who witnessed the assassin's attack at the time.</p>
<p>Twenty years later, on September 6, 1901, President McKinley was a guest of honor at the Pan-American Exposition in Buffalo, New York. Just as everyone was cheering, anarchist Leon Czolgosz suddenly fired two shots at the president, and the president died of his injuries.</p>
<p>And Lincoln's son was again one of the witnesses who witnessed the assassin's attack on the scene!</p>
<p>In all of American history, only three presidents have been assassinated and died, and there was actually such a person who witnessed the death of one president and also witnessed the assassination of the other two presidents.</p>
<p>After President McKinley's death, Lincoln's son gradually had a strange feeling. He regarded himself as an ill-omened person, which was not conducive to the owner of the White House. Later, although he often received invitations from the presidential palace, he always refused them. Until his own death in 1926, he never met any president.</p>
<p>Lincoln's son's voluntary avoidance, of course, cannot be blamed by anyone. It was really fate that made these things happen so coincidentally. And his deep belief in fate has a fourth reason.</p>
<p>This happened before his father was assassinated. According to Lincoln's son himself, "During the Civil War, I was studying at Harvard University. One day, it was a holiday, and I leaned against the outer wall of a train car, waiting for them to find me a berth. Unexpectedly, the train suddenly started, and my body swayed, and I almost fell under the wheels. At that time, fortunately, there was an unfamiliar passenger on the train who grabbed me with one hand and dragged me into the carriage."</p>
<p>You say there is nothing strange about this, is there? But, you have to know that if this person had not acted bravely and pulled him at that time, Lincoln's son would have died under the wheels long ago.</p>
<p>You may also say: "Passengers accidentally falling off the train is also a common thing. What you think is strange is nothing more than because the person who was in danger was the son of a president!"</p>
<p>No. Lincoln's son's account also has a sentence: "Later, I learned the name of the person who saved my life. His name was Edwin Booth."</p>
<p>Who knew that years later, the younger brother of his benefactor would be the murderer who assassinated his father!</p>
<h3>Uncivilized People</h3>
<p>— Yang Shi</p>
<p>Contrary to most people's expectations, there is still a small part of Germany that has not been occupied by the Allied forces. This area is called Büsingen, and more than 900 German residents live there in peace and contentment. Originally, this land was located within Switzerland and was completely surrounded by Switzerland. It was considered a small city-state of the German Confederation and has been German territory since 1809. After Germany surrendered, they lost contact with their motherland, and the shrewd British, American, Soviet, and French authorities did not think of this small piece of land. So they were in a free position. Now there is a union of these nine hundred residents, and they also exchange envoys with the Swiss local authorities, conducting all commercial operations of a "country" at that time.</p>
<h3>Wandering Flowers</h3>
<p>— Chen Shenyan</p>
<p>Chapter Eleven Full of Doubts 80</p>
<p>Zhu Zhai stopped for a moment and then asked, "What was the name of the person who came just now?" Qi Wan had already dried the tear stains on her face, faced outwards, glanced at Zhu Zhai, and replied, "Are you asking about that Section Chief Miao Lu Chang? He flew in from the south of the new government to handle the takeover affairs. Why are you asking about him?" Zhu Zhai said, "It's nothing. I think many of the newly arrived dignitaries and figures are not easy to deal with, especially the military. Several of them don't respect northern women very much, which is something I don't approve of at all. Who introduced you to this Section Chief Miao? I think you should avoid getting close to him in the future. Such people are not well-intentioned." When Qi Wan saw that Zhu Zhai was very nervous when he spoke, she knew in her heart that his words were indeed well-intentioned, but if she thanked him for his good intentions at this time, then all her work last night would be in vain. She immediately responded coldly, "That doesn't mean everyone is a bad person! I don't agree with what you said." Zhu Zhai had never been contradicted like this before, and he felt very unhappy. He still patiently and gently advised, "My words are based on facts. Recently, Lan Fen met a Section Chief Bai from the military, who played with her and gave her a terrible disease, and then abandoned her. Lan Fen is still in the hospital recovering. Isn't this an example?" After hearing this, Qi Wan knew that what Zhu Zhai said was true, but she thought his words were too blunt, so she immediately frowned and said, "What are you saying? Do you think I'm the same as Lan Fen?" Zhu Zhai was contradicted by Qi Wan again and lowered his head. When Qi Wan saw that Zhu Zhai's face was very embarrassed, she suddenly felt unbearable and said, "I understand the reason you're saying, and I appreciate your good intentions, but my acquaintance with this Section Chief Miao is for a purpose. I can't tell you the reason for now. Thank you for going out to find me last night, and tiring yourself out all night. I feel very uneasy. Now you should go back and rest, and I need to rest too." As she spoke, she stretched out a hand from under the quilt, shook Zhu Zhai's hand, and said, "You can go now!" Zhu Zhai wanted to say a few more words, but he was stunned by her half-warm, half-cold words. Seeing that Qi Wan turned her face inwards after saying these words and pulled the red silk quilt over her head, Zhu Zhai called out twice, but when she didn't answer, he had to reluctantly leave the bedroom. Just as he reached the stairs, Little Wang Ma blocked his way and said, "Mr. Xu, where are you going! Aren't you eating here?"</p>
<h3>Electrical Education in the United States</h3>
<p>— Mao Yi</p>
<p>"Electrical Education" is a new and effective form of education. In recent years, education authorities in our country have also advocated electrical education, but perhaps due to limited funds and materials, it has not been widespread. In the United States, the idea of bringing movies into the classroom was proposed at the beginning of this century, but most American teachers did not pay much attention to films at that time. According to statistics from the U.S. Department of Education in 1936, there were only 485 sound film projectors in public schools across the United States. However, today, the number of 16mm projectors in use has ballooned to around 35,000. Three-quarters of schools in cities with populations over 100,000 have electrical education equipment, and more than half of schools in cities with populations between 30,000 and 100,000 also have this equipment.</p>
<p>World War II gave a tremendous boost to educational films. Workers in war industries learned new skills. People who had never fired a gun quickly learned the secrets of anti-aircraft guns; new recruits became tank experts. According to estimates by the U.S. military, in one month in 1945, the cumulative number of soldiers watching training films was 18.5 million in the United States, 53 million in Europe, and a large number of soldiers watched them in other regions as well. These films covered everything from hygiene to artillery fire, greatly shortening military training time.</p>
<p>Today, this wartime experience is being widely applied in the United States to make education faster, richer, more useful, and more lasting.</p>
<p>Lively cartoons have made Mickey Mouse a household name, and now films enable students to quickly understand the amazing workings of the human nervous system, or the flow of blood, or the solemn rhythm of the solar system. From films, biology students can watch a frog egg grow into a mature frog, shortening a fifteen-week natural science course into ten minutes. As David Walker, a superintendent in Evanston, said, "Although I can't go to Antarctica, Byrd's expedition camera can bring it to me."</p>
<p>Using films, great actors bring the beauty of literature into the classroom. Experiments conducted by scientists in large universities can be "reincarnated" countless times so that students in the most remote schools can witness them as well. Various specialized educational films are now being produced in the United States.</p>
<p>Education is not just about knowing a variety of unrelated facts. Unless these facts are woven into real life, they are futile. This is the ideal that all great educators hold for true education. Do educational films make their ideals easier to achieve? Educational films do not diminish the importance of excellent teachers, just as telescopes have not eliminated astronomers. They simply provide better educational tools, making excellent teachers even better.</p>
<h3>New Year's Day</h3>
<p>— Chen Meng'an</p>
<p>I endure the chill in my worn-out fur coat from the past year, choosing kind words to ease my heart,</p>
<p>The clamorous sounds of spring startle and kill, the taste of the world is a mix of bitterness and spice;</p>
<p>Don't lament old age just because of my short temples, I want to empty the long bottle and enjoy myself,</p>
<p>Sitting here, I feel the first rays of sunshine returning with the warmth, let no one say my mouth is dry and lips parched.</p>
<h3>New Year's Eve</h3>
<p>— Chen Meng'an</p>
<p>Tomorrow is the New Year, the long night hurries the short watch,</p>
<p>Firecrackers compete from a thousand homes, lamp flowers cut open;</p>
<p>Sleepless, the cold penetrates the screen, leaning drunkenly, I pour a cup,</p>
<p>Past events are recalled in vain, my head turns alone in the long night.</p>
<h3>New Applications of Couplets</h3>
<p>—</p>
<p>In the newspapers of Pingjin, I saw the Spring Festival couplets of Shanghai Mayor Wu and Speaker Pan. Local authorities and celebrities here also wrote and distributed couplets to businesses and households. The wording is sharp and relevant, with a sense of the times. The practical application of couplets is becoming increasingly significant. Paired literature is a unique treasure of Chinese characters, something that other countries in the world cannot have. Because Chinese characters are "square and monosyllabic," each character occupies the same space, so it can establish the fabric of paired writing. One tone aligns with one tone, and one form aligns with one form. This is absolutely not something that Western writing, with its connected phonemes and uneven lengths, can do. Paired writing is used everywhere in various literary styles, but it is most evident in couplets. Couplets are purely woven with paired writing, and they are more neat and clear than poems, songs, and rhapsodies. Therefore, the study of various types of paired writing must be based on couplets, and couplets independently become a form of literature, suitable for celebrations, mourning, inscriptions, humor, gardens, residences, and journeys. The most popular among the public are Spring Festival couplets, because at the beginning of the New Year, every household likes to paste up a brand-new pair of door couplets, which brings a sense of renewal.</p>
<p>The beginning of Spring Festival couplets is said to be the five-character couplet of Shu Mengchang, which was intended to be auspicious. But later it expanded, with well-wishing ones such as "National Grace and Family Celebration," "Longevity and Abundant Years," "The Emperor's Virtue is as Great as Heaven and Earth," "The Imperial Grace is as Deep as Rain and Dew," "The Imperial Grace is as Vast as Spring," and "Civil Governance Radiates with Sunlight." There are also scholarly complaints, such as "Touching my heart, only Heaven is reliable," and "Contentment should be tolerated by the world," such as "For ten years, my heart has been colder than plum blossoms," and "One night of spring follows the sound of firecrackers." There are also those that are closely related to the industry, such as the coal shop's "Giant ancient forests burn for the rest of time," and "Ten thousand families rely on firewood to transmit the fire," such as the barbershop's "Coming are all hat-adjusting guests," and "Going, there should be no head-scratching people," which are appropriate for the time and scene, and have implications, with clever puns, all of which are excellent works. As for the bathhouse's "Before the golden rooster crows, the soup is already heated," and "The red sun rises, and the hall is full of guests," that is too realistic, with no implied meaning, not enough literary value. As for the most popular couplet since the Republic of China, "Men and women have equal rights, the public says the public is right, the mother-in-law says the mother-in-law is right," and "Lunar and solar calendars are combined, you celebrate your New Year, I celebrate my New Year," it is very interesting, with considerable irony towards all contradictory and complex phenomena. But if researched, then "the public says the public is right, the mother-in-law says the mother-in-law is right" are two old sayings. It expresses the meaning of living together in a family, and the difficulty for a wife between two mothers-in-law, similar to the meaning, and has no connection with "equal rights for men and women," and can only be regarded as borrowing.</p>
<p>In all categories, there is a very common couplet representing the national character of the old era, using "loyalty, honesty, and peace" as the common standard, such as "Loyalty and honesty leave room for maneuver," "Peace cultivates infinite natural opportunities," "Loyalty and honesty are passed down through generations," "Poetry and books are passed down from generation to generation," "There is a way to pass down the family, only to be honest and generous," and "There is nothing strange in life, but to be sincere." Many families use elegant calligraphy, carved on the gate, vermilion background with black characters, finely lacquered. Every New Year, they only wash and lacquer it once, because it has no timeliness, but has a permanent symbolic nature. People who are good at collecting customs can know that the Chinese nation is a truly peace-loving nation. In a world of natural selection and competition, they often suffer immediate losses, but the sincere expression of love for peace is better than advocating peace while actually abusing power, such as Germany and Japan during the war. This is something we must have confidence in. But in the ever-changing world trends of modern times, it is also a fact that traditional moral concepts alone are not enough to cope with. Therefore, those old couplets have a need for renewal.</p>
<p>In recent years, Spring Festival couplets have a brand-new look. The elements that constitute them can be summed up in two phrases: "Couplets become sloganized" and "Slogans become coupletized."</p>
<p>Why do couplets need to be sloganized? Because although the old-style couplets also had meaning and style, they had been in use for a long time and were full of stagnation, unable to meet the needs of the new era. In order to keep up with current affairs and remind the people, they had to adopt a slogan style. That is, clear and concise meaning, simple and powerful syntax, so that the public is shocked and inspired to be strong and capable. Since the May Fourth Movement, all new impetus, culture, politics, diplomacy, and the progress of international status have mostly benefited from slogan propaganda. Spring Festival couplets are something that has been seen by thousands of households in different places but with the same customs since ancient times, and it is incredibly convenient to use them for propaganda. Therefore, making them sloganized is indeed a convenient method that takes advantage of the situation.</p>
<p>Why do slogans need to be coupletized? Slogans are free verses, and even if they are very powerful, they can move the eyes and stimulate nerves, but they pass away quickly and are not easily spread among the public. Therefore, if you want to create a profound and universal impression, paired writing and rhyme are the most superior functions, especially in Chinese, where the structure is most convenient due to the square shape and single sound of the characters. Wenxin Diaolong said: "Creation gives form, taking the body must be double, the divine principle is used, things are not isolated. The heart generates words, cutting hundreds of thoughts, high and low need each other, naturally forming pairs." The ears, eyes, limbs of the human body, are divided into left and right, the two wings and feet of birds, the four hooves of beasts, are also paired, and even the construction and manufacturing of various objects can be verified. Although there is a distinction between ancient prose and parallel prose in Chinese literature, the sentences in so-called prose are often in pairs. Diaolong cited Tao's praise of "Doubts about guilt are light, doubts about merit are heavy," and Yichen's "Fullness invites loss, humility invites benefit." Saying "How to seek rhetoric, just to be in pairs," is not deliberately pairing, but naturally becoming paired. Ancient prose is like this, and modern prose is even more common. Now, in the auditoriums of public and private institutions, there are portraits of the Premier, with "The revolution has not yet succeeded" and "Comrades still need to work hard" on the left and right, which is a couplet. When the Premier issued these two instructions, they were not originally intended to be a couplet, and those who hang the portrait for worship did not necessarily look for a pair of couplets to hang at first. However, these two sentences happen to be six characters each, and they are relatively virtual and real, and the tones are harmonious. This is what the ancient sages called "How to seek rhetoric, just to be in pairs," which is absolutely true, and unexpectedly the same.</p>
<p>Now, every New Year, there are Spring Festival couplets that are appropriate for the time and use all over the country. That is, there are also many couplets in the halls for celebrations or mourning or commemorations. In addition, although there are hundreds of slogans in the conference hall, horizontally and vertically, everyone feels that there should be a pair of neat couplets on the high platform in the center. Slogans written in the style of couplets will definitely be remembered more than scattered mistakes, which can be tested and known.</p>
<p>Thus, "Couplets become sloganized" and "Slogans become coupletized" have become landmark literary records. The characteristics of Chinese characters are further revealed through new applications, and at the same time, modern talents awaken the enthusiasm of the public with special effects through this writing organization. This is called "mutual enhancement."</p>

<h3>Dim and Dark Streetlights on Jiangwan Road</h3>
<p>Theft of electricity was found, but there is no power to crack down</p>
<p>The Zhabei Water and Electricity Company replied in a letter: "We received your letter, based on the letter from reader Mr. Wu Bohua, who stated: 'I have been living on Jiangwan Road for nearly half a month, and the lights in my room and nearby areas were initially red and dim, and then became flickering and flickering. , as if dancing all night. Not only is this kind of light unusable, but it also affects the nerves and is harmful to health. In recent years, electricity bills have been adjusted repeatedly, and the length has increased. Users pay a heavy price and cannot get the effect of electric lights. What is the reason for this phenomenon? Does the factory have any remedies? Please Zhabei Water and Electricity Plant publicly respond.' We were instructed to handle it, so we sent personnel to investigate. The area of Jiangwan Road where Mr. Wu lives has been privately connected to the transmission lines set up by our company. Abuse of current has led to excessive loads and unstable voltage, resulting in the various phenomena described in Mr. Wu's letter. Those who steal electricity in this area are beyond the ability of our company to crack down on. We are now appealing to the competent authorities to control it. Once the theft is reduced, the lights can be improved. We hereby reply accordingly. Please check for your reference. This is to the Social Services Department of Shen Bao."</p>
