<h3 id="c27">越南走向分裂之路 <a href="#c27" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e27" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">27</a></h3>
<p>紛擾已久的越南問題，現巳進入新的分裂階段了。據中央社消息。越南新中央臨時政府，於本月二十日在西貢宣吿成立，由親法派阮文春將軍任總理，並佈吿宣稱安南遜王保大爲「陛下」。據阮文春說：內閣將於六月間組成，其閣員名單經保大核准後，即可發表。據西貢消息：新關共廿二人，阮文春兼國防部長，屬交趾支那者九人，東京者七人，安南者六人。新政府初擬設立於安南首都順化之宮中，現已改爲河內，其統治區爲東京·安南與交趾支那三邦。從上述的報道看來，越南新政府是由法國扶植成立的，並未經普選的程序，當不能視爲應民意而產生；而且安南遜王保大復位後，即爲政府權力以上的君主，是否爲人民所擁戴，更成問題。今後越南同法國的關係，是自治領的關係；越南新政府同胡志明領導下的越盟的關係，是南北朝的對立關係。僅此一點，即足以說明越南在領土上·政治上。已走向了分裂之途了。在遠東的歷史上，災是繼朝鮮分裂之後的又一幕悲劇！</p>
<p>越南是東南亞一塊沃土，地理的政治的歷史的因素，造成五個世紀以來地勢變遷的悲劇。一四七一年安南人滅占城，十五世紀末抵歸仁，一六一一年抵當英，一六六三年抵藩龍，一六九七年抵平順，一六九八年抵西貢，最後在十九世紀上半葉爲法國統治，二十世紀初葉又遭日本和暹羅的侵襲，四百餘年的越南，並不是越南人所希望的統一國家。竺可楨敎授比喻越南僚一個啞鈴，實含有地理的歷史的意義。第二次大戰後，越南革命運動的澎湃，由外而內，裏應外合，掘起了胡志明。按胡志明領導下的「越南獨立同盟」，簡稱越盟，堅持越南獨立，統一三圻，與怯國的政策根本不合，致多次法越談判，未獲結果。一九四六年三月六日的法越初步協定，以及同年九月十五日的法越臨時協定，成立後仍被撕破，以致　成戰事。無庸諱言的，法越戰爭一年有半，法國武力征服越盟的計劃是失敗了，怯軍對於窮山荒野的胡志明游擊軍，大有無可奈何之嘆。更由於法國本身的脆弱，國內經濟惡劣與政治糾紛的發展，深惑越南軍事上的重負，不能再將越局延續下去，而另求「和平」解決之路。</p>
<p>法國「和平」解決越南問題的對策，先於越南南部扶植右黨勢力，以對杭胡志明，幷分裂越盟的聯合陣綫。繼則爭取安南遜王保大，擁立復位，以統治三圻。保大是安南阮氏王朝（一八〇二—一九四五年）第十三代，也就是最末一代的皇帝，今年還只三十七歲。他於一九四五年八月，因受國內外局勢的前道，無法繼續他的王位，終於宣告退位，當時曾引起全越人民的稱許。保大息影香港，法國不斷與之保持接觸，去年與怯初步談判，一方而自然是想朮登王位，另方面也想與怯國和平解決越局，結果未能如願以償。他和法國專員波拉特在夏隆灣法艦上，雖曾簽定非正式協定，然祇有原則上的規定，後來保大飛　倫敦，再轉日內瓦，與波氏作具體的談判時，雙方交涉忽又陷入僵局。據傳波氏向保大提出條件是：（一）怯支持保大復辟，成立越南君主立憲政府，以越南爲怯蘭西聯邦下的一個自治邦；（二）越南派遣外交使節，須經法方核准，（三）越南軍隊須由法國軍官訓練，由法方指揮；（四）保大應保護法國在越南的文化與經濟利益。在這重重限制下，保大的地位完全是傀儡的地位，越南的地位究全是殖民地的地位。保大雖是對建貴族的人物，可是他的思想幷不保守，與溥儀的性格和生活，逈然不同，所以他拒絕了怯國的條件，悄然離開日內瓦而回香港。</p>
<p>保大回港後，越南地方政府決議支持保大，阮字輩越南統一同盟是反對胡志明一系的中堅派人物，紛紛到港舉行會議，法保雙方互有讓步。本月廿日西貢新政府的宣吿成立，可說是法保談判相當成熟的明證。越南新政府以保大復辟爲號召，但保大是否立即回到越南，不是毫無問題的。保大想利用怯國反胡與胡志明反怯的矛盾而存在，想利用越南三圻人民的畏法與懼共的心理而存在，但他能否肅淸胡志明的力量，平街三圻複雜民族的糾紛，也是不無疑問的。現在，胡志明對保大復辟，尙持沉默的態度，如果保大回越以後，不能在政治上爭取得胡志明，「和平」解決越局，則法越戰爭勢將轉變爲越南的內戰，越南獨立前途可能愈趨黯淡了。這樣，越南走向分裂之途，將與朝鮮的悲劇一樣，陷入不可挽救的浩刧中，將使越南在地理上歷史上，永遠成爲一個「啞鈴」。</p>

<h3 id="c50">隴東大捷的高潮 <a href="#c50" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e50" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">50</a></h3>
<p>— 本報記者　張僊洲</p>
<p>〔本報西安廿六日航訊〕共匪四月六日從宜君以南，竄到馬欄等地，十七日晚上自高望鎭越過涇河，很快的拿下了邠縣，長武，永壽席捲關中西部，當時國軍剛好集中在銅川附近。從巡河到渭河中間，地勢起伏，大谷甚多，大兵團不易渡過，共匪看中了道一點，對他們有利，就馬上利用了。</p>
<p>三個地帶</p>
<p>這次戰役，可以分作三個地帶來記述：（一）邠長乾永地區（二）關中西部，（三）隴東與陜北。</p>
<p>邠長地區的勝利是馬繼援部與南綫乾縣國軍配合的第一個結果。當南綫國軍以雷霆之勢追擊時，馬繼援部於四月廿三日由西峯出發在長武城郊與匪遭遇。駐在西蘭綫上的匪軍是第六縱隊，至廿五日克長武後，住在邠南亭口鎭附近的匪軍發慌了，因爲整八十二師的大刀馬隊是以殺人出名的。他馬上把匪軍主力撤到亭口以南十華里處，那裘地勢甚複雜，共匪就把北邊的路全數破壞企圖阻止八二師南下。當時此種揹施被一個老百姓吿訴了該部，八二師就改從兩翼迂迴。騎兵的行動迅遞，共匪東南西三面遭受包圍，北通路已毀，而且空軍描射方畢，又遭這一仗打擊，全部被殲。據事後調查，匪軍新四旅旅司令員程悅長陣亡，連他們縱隊司今司員羅源發的伙伕，也被俘了。據他供稱羅在軍潰之時，四顧沒路走。就命令一個副官用手搶打死他自己，那個副官然後也自殺了。南綫的國軍於廿五日晚克復監軍鎭，廿八晨永壽與馬師會合。這地區的戰事，吿了一個段落。</p>
<p>戰局扭轉</p>
<p>沿隴海路西進的國軍，由廿五日起，向匪的第四縱隊及第二縱隊攻擊。道一綫的匪軍，不戰而退，國軍順利的克復武功扶風，至廿七日克復了岐山鳳翔蔡家坡而至寶鷄，匪軍主力北竄入需山中，在鳳翔以北，集結三個縱隊的主力，幷稱他們要在這裏以優勢的兵力，在優勢的地區，打跨國軍然後東犯，與陳在部在西安外國會師。</p>
<p>四月廿九日拂曉，慘烈的戰鬥開始了，這是匪軍第一次在西北與國軍打「痛快仗」！經過了九小時的激戰，國軍陸空配合，以强大的火力把匪軍的陣地摧毀，這一仗打破了共匪建立湃山軍區的幻夢，扭轉了西北整個戰局。種下了隴東大捷的前因。據綏署部公佈戰果，俘匪一千四百人獲得步槍五百枝，輕重機槍三十多挺。匪在蔡家坡一帶掠奪之物資，（以布疋日用品爲主）二千八百輛大車。斃匪在八百人以上。國軍以日步百廿華里之行程，續向東北方面尾追剿擊。在同一期內，北綫國軍在崔木及常寗把胡景鐸率的騎六師全數殲滅。</p>
<p>彭德懷和趙壽山在馬欄出竄之前演說，匪軍的目的在「擴大解放區」，「建立　隴根據地」。如萬不得已退踞六盤山，可是當他們一敗於靈山之戰，再敗於永壽之戰，士氣大落，在涇川城外，又中了一次空城計。當彭德懷跑到涇川以南時，不知道城內住了多少國軍，未敢輕犯，向西繞數十里越西閘路則北竄，其實那時涇川是一座空城，僅有幾百個保安隊，彭匪多疑，自討苦吃，遲走了一步，國軍的追擊部隊和堵擊部隊全部趕上了。</p>
<p>電話插曲</p>
<p>隴東大捷是國軍把共匪趕到口袋中，馬繼援趕上紮了口。當馬繼援部以兩個團把趙壽山所率的匪軍二個旅團在屯子鎭的時候，彭德懷很迅速的從玉都廟率領第二縱隊主力反把該部圍在二層，於是腹背受敵，苦戰肉搏，歷經三畫夜。當時國軍北上援兵在玉都荔鎭等地與匪激戰，六日晚曾有幾件插曲：一件是馬繼援與國軍六五師李振師長打電話，前者說的一口甘肅腔，後者又是粵調，後來這個在這邊喊〔打！打打！」郝個也只回答「打！打打！」「在玉都，」「嘆，在玉都！」結果，就打起來了。那一天有風，我們由兩地出發，中途遇見，發生了小誤會，打起槍來。雙方相互驚異，匪軍從來沒有道麼兇，後來才知道打錯了。一件是屯子鎭的匪軍冒國軍某團名打電話給馬師長，問尙有多少援軍可以調出援彼，由那條路上打來。結果被識破了，雙方在電話機上大駡起來了。</p>
<p>五月六日晚，偶師攻克屯子鎭之前，月黑風高，共匪由屯子鎭南溝中脫出，等第二天馬師入城時，匪多他逸，惟重武器全留下了。這一役共匪死傷之重，實在重得很，這是隴東大捷的高潮。</p>
<p>共匪突圍之後，倉惶東竄，國軍以日行百二十里之行程追擊，共匪在渡馬運河時，已潰不成軍，從切下的文件中看，只說是到延安集合。至本月十六日止，這一個大轉灣算是轉完了。據西安綏署所發表的戰績是共匪傷亡二萬七八千人，被我俘虜者六千五百二十五人，失散四五千人，步槍五六七二枝，各種砲類一二五門，機槍四四三枝，電台四座。擊散匪第一第四第六三個縱隊司令部及七個旅部。</p>
<p>聞勝不驕</p>
<p>西北行轅政工處長上官業佑在涇川招待記者幽時，曾總結此次戰役大勝之原因，係由於關中兵團與隴東兵團酊合得嚴密保安團隊與國軍配合得適當。軍民及地方政府合作，通訊聯絡迅確，補給機構健全及空軍的力量用得恰當。至於西北未來的軍事勢態，馬少香（繼援）師長說得好，共軍補給比我們快一點，這次雖然我們打了他一下，有半年時間，他們又會整補起來，也許比現在還兇，他們一定要作更慘烈的報復性的大戰。這一次我們大家合作的戰勝了匪軍，下次該如何呢？現在，我們惟有聞勝不驕，等待着暴風雨的襲來吧！</p>

<h3 id="c52">美共和黨全代大會前　麥帥無意返國述職　正式電覆參院撥款會主席　麥帥將被提名為總統候選人呼聲甚高 <a href="#c52" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e52" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">52</a></h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕紐約廿八日廣播：華盛頓訊，麥帥早已爲共和黨方面提名爲總統候選人，自昨日參院委會投票表決請其返國陳述意見後，推選麥帥爲總統之呼聲較前益高。</p>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓廿八日電〕麥帥今日電覆參院撥款委會主席勃里奇，表示在下月舉行共和黨候選總統全國提名代表大會以前，不願回國。據稱，「目前余若回國，無論目的如何眞摯，將被多數人士誤解並指斥爲具有政治作用。反之，一俟下月解決政治問題之後，如果諸君仍欲本人說明對於公衆關切各事之見解，定可悉憑尊意辦理」。勃氏得電棧宣稱，麥帥之意，余已了解，將以該項覆文從速提交參院撥款委會。</p>
<p>〔路透社華盛頓廿七日電〕參院撥款委員會頃以十七對一票，通過要求麥克阿瑟將軍返美，向國會提出遠東局勢之意見。先是太平洋戰爭爆發時，任駐菲美軍司令之魏恩來將軍曾請國會召麥帥返國，提供關於美國在遠東軍事需要之意見，魏將軍率領若干參戰軍人擁護麥帥競選共和黨候選總統。據參院撥款委會委員惠利代表該會多數委員發表意見稱，該會之決定請麥帥返國，並無政治動機。惠氏認爲美國之佔領日本，乃美國戰後政策中一光明之點，相信麥帥必能向國會提供有償値的情報。另據此間政界人士稱，參院撥款委會之召回麥帥，乃恢復麥帥競選機會的一種聰明嘗試，蓋渠於兩個月前在成斯康辛之預選中已遭挫敗故也。麥帥於太平洋戰爭前即出國，至今未返故國，今若返國自能引起一般人之騷動也。</p>
<p>〔美國新聞處華盛頓廿七日電〕陸長羅雅爾今日致電麥帥稱，參院撥款委會已通過一項動議，令其主席參議員勃里奇請求麥帥返美，以便出席該委會，發表關於遠東問題之意見。羅雅爾在英電訊內稱，勃里奇提議六月二日或三日爲「閣下出席」之便利日期，並謂，「有人曾向余提議，請閣下携眷同來。</p>
<p>〔怯國新聞社華盛頓廿七日電〕杜魯門總統吿記者稱，渠曾要求麥帥來華盛頓晤商，唯須視麥帥能否離日而定，渠願麥帥能應參院委會之邀請，出席報吿遠東局勢。總統又稱，渠完全贊同麥帥之政策，並願在各方面對之加以支持。</p>
<p>〔聯合社東京廿八日電〕美國今日電促麥帥返國，象徵完成整個美國對遠東政策之嘗試，參院撥款委員會此種決定，極富挑撥性，殆爲對麥帥行施權術。該委會請麥帥當面陳述「東方局勢」之意見，無疑包括三大問題，其中兩項與麥帥直接有關。（一）麥帥常詳細對日本之觀感，作爲美國支援亞洲經濟入門。（二）繼續援華之範圍與種類；（三）美國未來對刺鮮政策，尤其是南韓最近舉行選舉後，應否繼續加以佔領。美國對於三國政策之相互呼應，益形需要。同時政治方面，麥帥此次回國乃爭取共和黨總統候選人提名之最後機會。共和黨初選結果，麥帥是否已放棄提名之希望，尙無暗示。美國對日佔領事宜已進入比較平靜時期，目前注重擴大美國資助之經濟建設，此乃麥帥一貫佔領政策之頂點，故參院之邀請，至少適得其時。</p>

<p>〔合衆社倫敦廿八日電〕蘇聯今日指斥英國二次大戰爆發前三個月，允許德國在東歐及東南歐自、由行動，且將舊非洲太平洋屬地交歸德國。莫斯科電臺廣播稱，蘇外交部將蘇軍所俘獲之信件，彙編成「世界二次大戰前新文件」第二卷而加以出版。其中包括德駐英大使竇克遜於一九三八至一九三九年間致德外部之函電及報吿書。一九三九年八月三日，時値德侵波蘭前一個月，實氏尙與英外次威爾遜商談締結英德互不侵犯及不干涉條約。寶氏向德外部報告，伍爾德威爾遜談話之基礎繼續有效。英德協約之諦約，當可使英國對波蘭土耳其及他國之保證無效。竇威談話中，且涉及原料殖民地，財政援助德國及其他問題。其後寶氏返德，其在英德談判中之任務亦吿終了。莫斯科電台又稱，英內閣於一九三九年二月決定將德前地歸還德國，英國於三月間因德併捷克而提抗議後，六七月間仍舉行一連串秘密談判。</p>

<p>建設計劃</p>
<p>國務院擬議中的計劃，乃在一九四九年六月三十日之前，以六千萬美元供給中國，作爲舉辦若干主要建設計劃之用。此等計劃，目前中國殆無力興資舉辦。至於應選擇何種計劃以便推行，或決定何種建設在先，何者在後，或何者先撥付經費，何者後撥等項問題，自應由該計劃之執行人員決定之。但下開數項計劃，均已屢經研究，且委員會方面亦認爲今日中國所迫切需要者。此即上海電力供應之計劃，粵漢路及廣九路之復興，贛西與湘溉煤礦之重新開採等是。</p>
<p>執行人員或可發現在三億六千三百萬元中，絕大部份可用於舉辦各種復興計劃方面，此等計劃應爲中國人所能繼續自辦而不必需要外來援助者。如此則美國似更可精確觀察美國金錢到底如何使用，一面又可鼓勵私人企業。舉例而言，在合理之經費支付下，採取即可付諸實施之農業改進步驟，以期對農產品，農村情况，以及土地改革方面加以改善，乃中美農業專家所久已翹望者。中國之農業經濟情狀與西歐大不相同，故必須如此處置，此外吾人尙須竭力設怯增進食物自農村至城市區域之自由運輸。</p>
<p>穏定通貨問題</p>
<p>一般人曾討論提供自銀之變通辦怯，以代替相當數額之商品，因此苟能輔以若干措施，中國可能恢復硬幣基礎，作爲穩定通貨之一種步驟。某一報告中謂，此項辦怯毋需一鉅額之借款，因於一九四七年內中國境內流通之通貨總額，估計價値約在二億五千萬至三億五千萬美元之間。另一被提出之數字，則爲白銀六億盎司，由美國貸與，藉以奠定調節適當之通貨基礎。</p>
<p>惟馬歇爾國務卿謂，根據我國貨幣專家之意見，提供通貨穩定基金，需要鉅大數額，而在目下必須應付戰爭與民間支離破碎之情形下，其中大部份將被耗損。據悉，有關此一題目之另一報吿，刻正準備向委員會提出中。</p>
<p>中國之還償借款</p>
<p>委員會方面明瞭中國政府對自美國政府獲得之任何借款，在還償方面從未失信。關於一九四二年之美國對華信用貸款五億美元，以及中國其他戰時負債，其還償辦法，將田中美戰債淸理談判作最後決定。進出口銀行前在馬歇爾國務卿要求之下，曾預定核准五億美元作為對華借款，惟於一九四七年六月三十日因預定期滿而未付諸實施。在此項預定過期之後，中國方面曾提出數額相當大之信用貸款申請數次，但該銀行並未貸與，其理由爲無怯獲得還償之保證。</p>
<p>委員會對於中國政府還償美國借款之信譽，印象頗深。惟有一點應予指出，即鑒於國民政府之經濟處境，在草法案項下所擬給予之援助，大部份勢須以贈與之方式出之。</p>
<p>美國援助能否惠及平民？</p>
<p>一九四八年二月十九日，司徒雷登大使稱，對華援助計劃「旨在惠及平民」。委員會重複說明，即負責執行此項計劃，務必注意此點確在農村地區以及較少數之都市中心獲得實現。美元在華之應用目的，乃爲計劃執行人及中國政府應首先予以注意之責任。</p>
<p>美國在華商業利益</p>
<p>美國在華商業在停頓中。美國之商業利益曾爲種種歧視之措置訴苦，後者使其不得享有平等之商業機會。中國政府如能去除對轍出活動之障碍，並保證對美國商業利益不採取歧視待遇，則大有助於鼓勵中國之傅統自由企業，並吸引外國之貿易與投資。委員會以爲中國政府將發現循此等路綫採取積極行動，在多方面係屬有益。</p>
<p>對華協定</p>
<p>委員會擬以廣泛之權限授予國務卿，以便與經濟合作執行人協商後，與中國締訂協定，其中規定中國須在可能範圍內向美國納稅人保證其所付之金錢將予以有效之運用，以達到本法案及中國人民之目標。委員會雖認爲若干細節或需修正或添加，以配合建議中之計劃，但承認根據第八十屆國會公共法律八十四條於一九四七年十月廿七日在南京所簽訂之協定。該協定之內容重印在附錄乙中。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕舞業職工舞女搗毀社會局案，昨日由提藍橋特種刑庭首次公審。晨九時許王震南庭長，孫體鈴，徐乃堃審判官，徐樂詩書記官升座後，提在押被吿唐宗傑等三十七名，傳交保被吿兪志琴等三十二名審訊。各報記者及被吿家屬入內旁聽，均先簽名領取旁聽證入內。法警荷槍實彈，戒備森嚴。法庭內因屋小人多，座無隙地。在押被吿均面黃肌瘦，頭髮蓬鬆，行路搖搖欲倒。舞女洪小萍王敏等入庭即掩面啜泣，迄退庭哭泣未止。交保被吿則精神活潑，雙方相形之下，有天壤之別。辯護律師陳霆銳，周一志等十餘人上午均到，下午僅有律師一人出庭。上午審至十二時，下午自二時審至四時許。庭諭今日下午二時繼續審訊，幷開始辯論。</p>
<p>九時十五分，先由王庭長點名，六十九名均到。迄十時卅五分點完，王庭長即宣稱：「本庭於本年三月十七日接到上海市警察局移送書，內容爲朱罪，兪志琴等搗毀社會局一案，違反戡亂時期危害國家緊急治罪條例第七條，送請本庭審判。本庭因其係用移送書送來，作爲起訴論，今日開始審判。</p>

<p>首訊無業城工會理事長唐宗傑。唐着灰布長衫，滿面愁容。庭上訊問唐：「是否率領舞業職工搗毀社會局？是否接受共黨命令？今天給你一個機會，如係受共黨唆使，可以坦白講出來，否則調查出來於你們不利。」唐答稱：「此次舞業發生風潮，係因社會局提早抽籤，時職工舞女均在新仙林開會，約有二千餘人，聞此消息，均以舞與偉業以後，有　業恐慌，爲了要吃飯，故集體向社會局請願，不料到社會局以後，又無人出來接見，以致群情激憤，造成不幸事件。故此次搗毀社會局，全係出於一時感情衝動，絕無共黨滲　其間。自己係三民主美靑年團團員，決不致受共黨利用。</p>
<h3 id="c75">向社局請願　係聯合主持 <a href="#c75" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e75" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">75</a></h3>
<p>此次向社會局請願，係由舞廳業聯合辦事處主持，其間包括資方（孫洪元等），職工（唐宗傑等），舞女（金美虹等），管理員（吳福根等），音樂師（何海等）五部份，請願幷非單獨職工會之責任。至傳說舞女不去請願罰款三百萬元，職工不去停職，職工會更無此權力。職工會常務理事胡運源則供稱：「服從命令固然要緊，吃飯也要緊。」王敏着黑色旗袍，供時抽泣不已，供稱：「在塲由黨旗，未進社局辦公室，毆打照片中不是我自己，我頭髮短，而此人頭髮長，請願時我着長皮旗袍，而此人着短外套，且係背影，不足爲憑。」舞女洪小萍·譚佩娥·馮愛娜·孫惠玲·李君·羅英·楊莉莉等供時均泣不成聲。金祖坤水認曾喊口號，惟其口號爲「擁護憲法」。</p>

<p>在此六十九名被吿中，唯一非舞業人員允中女中學生金英，衣藍竹布旗袍，年十七歲，供稱：「過去同學現做舞女之陳菊萍，約我到美琪看電影，因買不到票，陳呌我到新仙林去看看。時舞業人員正擬出發請願，他們拉我上卡車。到社會局後，陳呌我喊「拿出勇氣來！」口號，我跟着喊，被警察局逮捕。」王庭長對此大發雷霆，加以申斥：「此案如全係舞業人員，人家不致曾疑有政治作用，現在因你一人夾雜其中，使人家疑惑學生煽動舞潮，疑有政治背景，你現在十七歲已經害了這許多人，要到三十七歲你要害多少人！」說得金英號啕大哭，而旁聽席上爲之閧堂。</p>
<h3 id="c77">衆口一詞　並未動手 <a href="#c77" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e77" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">77</a></h3>
<p>下午開庭，傳訊交保被吿，照例問：「你參加請願沒有？是否動手搗毀社會局？」被吿均答：「去的，但未動手，立在後面，何人動手沒有看見。」惟至最後，遠東大班張榮壽。馬鴻奎呈上證明書一件，證明渠等係中統局通訊員，渠等供稱，到社會局不是請願，是去做工作，渠等以堅決之語氣稱：「內中決無共黨活動。」</p>
<p>末王庭長傳宗傑，以會議紀錄交唐閱看，其中有一條決議案「集體向社會局請麒」係唐提出者。王庭長以嚴岐之語氣稱：「此次社會局搗毀事件，係由提議請願者而起，因請願共黨始得乘機活動，故爾係罪魁禍首，不得辭其咎。」唐聞此睛天霹靂，泣供稱：「我在會議中從朱提議，此項紀錄係出僞造，企圖陷害，請庭上愼重調查。」至此，庭論明日下午（指廿九日）開始辯論，覊押者仍還押，交保者仍交原保。</p>

<p>退庭時，各報記者請求王庭長准許與被吿唐宗傑作十分鐘之談話。王庭長准許。據唐與記者談：「我在社會局時力勸職工不要輕舉妄動，當時舌敝唇焦，在塲記者當有見到者，不料事後資方將責任均推於職工會身上，而警局調查結果，竟無一資方被吿，殊欠公允。且僞造紀錄，使我蒙不白之冤，深望與論界主持公道。」當時有社會局出事時在塲記者多人目擊唐曾制止羣衆騷動，表示必要時願爲作證云。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕吳市長於昨晚七時，應本市雜誌業之邀，赴北京路中一大樓復旦同學會會址發表演說，吳市長首先表示謙虛，稱渠向來怕對文化界演講，因恐貽笑大方。繼稱，目前中國雜誌銷路慘澹，竟尙不及美國雜誌在華暢銷，研究外國雜誌之所以成功，固有其外在之環境因素，諸如羣衆之知識程度高，空運發達等。</p>
<p>三點內在因素</p>
<p>此外本人認爲尙有三點內在因素：（一）準確性：記得美國有一種「幸福」雜誌，特標明本刋所載全屬事實，讀者中如能抓住錯誤者，賞洋五元等字樣，結果甚爲成功。（二）迎合社會心理：西洋雜誌對象劃分淸楚，內容針對某一階層，故各雜誌均有其固定之讀者。（三）富有在安定中求進步的精神：西洋雜誌創刋之時，往往有堅定之把握，遠大之目光，在最初數期，不求有功，但求無過，及至讀者獲有信心，然後逐漸發展。此種精神似爲中國雜誌界所缺少，現時雜誌界之普遍現象，爲創刊號最好，以後即一期不如一期，且脫期更爲司空見慣，這種現象，足以影響雜誌銷路，若能改善，則深信中國雜誌界前途必然無可限量，俗語有云：只有吃得舌中苦，天下就沒有不成功的事情。恭祝雜誌界同仁爲文化前進努力。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕本市有徐益勤君，（見圖）近特函國立上海醫學院稱，願將其本人死後屍體，供給敎學實驗之用。並在其隨身帶皮夾內一足球賽券後面預立遺囑，謂「本人不論在何時何地逝世，均請將經過通知上海醫學院領屍供解剖之用」其破除迷信之精神，足爲社會開風氣之先。記者於昨晚特往訪徐君，據吿渠現任市工務局園塲管理處視察，現年卅五歲，上海人，對此舉並無特殊理由或怪僻異想，乃因日前閱報悉，上海醫學院缺乏解剖敎材，渠認爲人體根本由細胞組成，故死後屍體如何處置，都無所謂，且現時科學發達，過去陳舊觀念，亟應打破，因此即投函該醫學院。</p>
<p>徐君本年畢業金陵大學農學系，抗戰時曾參加軍隊服務，曾研究各項農產品，改良製造，如製造麥片，在貴陽設廠多所，精製乾菓，並利用咖啡瓶，將瓶蓋改裝氣壓調節塞製造四川泡菜。當其畢業時，曾著論文，題爲「軍用乾菜」。渠並表示其雖受大學敎育，研究科學，自愧了無成就，今願於死後以本人屍體供給敎學，總算對社會國家有一些貢獻。又調此事實不値重視，謙稱勿以其名氏發表，免爲外界誤會。</p>
<p>又記者昨日往訪時，適徐君外出，其夫人現任職海關，聞悉此事後，突然焦急萬狀，雙手與聲音均發抖，蓋其事前並未知徐君曾有此類書信致醫學院，而昨日自中午後即未見徐歸來，故疑發生意外，慌忙携其四齡獨子，出外借打電話向各處探問，約歷一小時，未明蹤跡，廢然而返，但此時徐已歸家，經說明後，徐君亦頗以事先未曾吿知太太表示歉然。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕聖約翰大學學生會以反對「美國扶植日本問題」爲中心而發起之「民族展覽會」昨日仍在校內繼續展覽，惟已自交誼室中移至草坪上，展品多　木刻漫畫照片等，昨日曾有不少中外記者前往參觀，其中最令人矚目者，莫過於所謂「中國抗戰英雄」之朱德照片。</p>
<p>此次展覽會之開端，實爲五二〇紀念會上所發動，嗣後並經「美國扶植日本問題座談會」上所決定，當時約大校長涂羽卿，經濟系敎授林穆光，曁代理訓導長潘世茲曾親自出席參加，並邀得校長之允准。但最近因校長有制止展覽會繼續舉行之措施，學生方面遂提出責問，並發表長約千字之文吿一紙，對校方表示不滿。同時並要求校方公布美國大使館領事館人員於日前往訪校長談話經過及要求涂校長表示能度。</p>
<p>此外，激起此次事件之另一原因，則爲該校三民主義敎授陳仁炳之激烈演講，具有極大作用。陳氏於演講會上曾在呼反對國內外法西斯復興，及向美國左傾領袖華萊士看齊。同時並激動學生在被政府當局禁止學聯活動之旗幟下，一致團結起來！</p>
<p>造自最近數日中外報章揭發此一事件之內幕後，學生方面情緒極爲緊張，現定今日下午在校內舉行記者招待會，將對此事經過有所報吿。至原定今日下午舉行每年一度之校友園遊會，屆時能否不受影響照常舉行，尙成問題。</p>

<p>米市續見翱翔，仍以無錫報漲之故，南港產區價亦見高，益以到貨日减，貨主不願低脫，塲內因限價之故，交易仍擯持未開。供應米繼續拋出，二市塲仍爲六千石，價亦不動。塲外價白粳喊高達七百萬大關，後市略爲虛疲，薄稻羊秈各爲六百九十萬元，一致較上日挺三四十萬元。白元以端節化活，上白元達八百萬高似，惟至收市，均稍露疲象。昨客貨登記共有二千四百八十三石</p>
<p>麵粉挺升，惟至收市略轉疲落。早市因米價之續漲，執貨者仍竭力扳特，早開最屬堅俏，老車及兵船粉各以二百二十二萬元開市，旋即以逢高有吐，散戶不敢多納，兵船回降爲二百十五萬，老車二百十六萬，終仍升六七萬元。紅蜂·建成·各以二百十萬收市，軋漲五萬元。中信局拋粉價格不變，昨共拋九千二百包。麩皮升六七萬，小麥以二百九十萬元成交。</p>

<p>食油略見疲落，生油上日挺升較多，昨下跌亦鉅，出戶雖然不多，進戶意亦淡薄，致交易淸閒。靑島吉桶生油以一千七百四十萬開出，計挫六十萬元。豆油雖降甚微，僅稱平疲。本街銷路以豆油較活，大有豆油初以一千五百萬開出，繼開一千五百十萬元，最低長德豆油一千四百六十萬。生菜油廠方以新菜籽登塲較多，故開售不吝，價挫三四十萬元。小車蔴油降三十萬元。豆餅初汕帮有納意，成交三四萬，終以納而不多，仍退回上日原價。</p>

<h3 id="c114">廠商請求輸入原料　必須具有實銷把握 <a href="#c114" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e114" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">114</a></h3>
<p>日前中國棉織業委產銷聯營公司爲外銷棉織品運往香港後，遭受賠累，曾呈轍管會請求救濟。頃據輸管會輸出推廣處發言人表示，輸管會輸出推廣處之輸出品製造原料轍入辦法，其重要目的凡三：（一）推廣國貨外銷，（二）增加國庫外匯收入，（三）協助廠商獲得原料，緘輕成本。自經辦以來，各製造廠及出口商前往申請輸入原料者頗形踴躍，截至目前爲止，大體尙稱滿意。廠商應用該項辦法後，能輸入一部份原料，藉以减低其外銷成本，故對推廣製造品輸出方面，頗多裨益。但最近該處進悉有若干出口商，因希望獲得進口原料，貿然申請。而外銷貨品，並無成交之買主，又無確有把握之實銷具體計劃，事實上僅係將上海貨物轉運香港，待機再謀實銷。因此一旦香港市塲如發生不利之變化，勢必賠累。且對於政府推廣輸出原旨，亦未盡相符。例如中國棉織業產銷聯營公司雖經輸出推廣處核准，以其棉織品輸出，所得外匯百分之四十輸入原料。但因該公司將棉織品運抵香港後，適逢香港市面有急驟變化，棉織品市價跌落，以致蒙受損失。輸出推廣處方面對此深表惋惜，但該公司所以賠累之原因，實因該公司不明商業慣例，負祖風險太大所致。輸廣處發言人表示，希望各製造廠及出口商應用上項辦法請求輸入原料時，其輸出之製造品，必需確已成交，有實銷把握，以免遭受意外賠累云。</p>

<h3 id="c139">「韻英」考 <a href="#c139" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e139" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">139</a></h3>
<p>— 唐蘭</p>
<p>從來學者都認爲天寶時有兩種韵英，一是「天寶韻英」，一是「陳廷堅韻英」，這個錯誤是由戴雲開始的。韓氏聲的考卷四願氏音論跋說：</p>
<p>大賽末集賢注記稱上以自古用韻，不甚區分，陸法言切韻又未能　革，乃改換撰韵英，仍舊爲五卷。舊韻四百三十九，新加百五十一，合五百八十韻，萬九千一百七十七字，分析至細。而南部新書天賽時有陳庭堅撰韵英十卷，然則注記所謂舊韻四百三十九，殆庭堅之謂與？所謂仍舊爲五卷者，殆依法言卷帙與？</p>
<p>王國維觀堂集林卷八有「天賽韵英陳廷堅韵英張戠考聲切韻武玄之韻詮分部考」說：</p>
<p>玉海四十五引韋述集賢注記云：「天寶末，……合五百八十，分析至細」云云，案舊韻四百三十九，不知何指，南部新書謂天寶末有陳友元廷堅撰韻英十卷，載東原疑舊韻指廷堅韻，蓋兩書皆名韻英，天寶御撰之書，當因廷堅書而廣之，理或然也。</p>
<p>但是韻英的作者，據懲琳一切經音義前景審所做的序文裏說是「元廷堅」所以王先生在那篇文章裏又說：</p>
<p>撰韻英者，一切經音義序作元廷堅，南部新書作陳友元庭堅，未知孰是，其人均無可考。</p>
<p>我讀那篇文章時正看太平廣記，在第四百六十卷裏發現了作韻英的是陳王友元庭堅，曾寫信吿訴王先生，王先生在觀堂集林的書眉上寫下了：</p>
<p>嘉興唐友蘭謂當作陳王友元廷堅，見太平廣記鳥類。（見國學月報王靜安先生專號姚名達所作觀堂集林眉批表）</p>
<p>但是後來編王忠　公遺書的人，却在王先生原文「其人均無可考」一句上，刪去「未知孰是」四字，硬栽了「太平廣記烏類作陳王友元廷堅」十三字，其用意似乎想替王先生把他的文章修改妥善，但在不知不覺間却犯了一個很大的錯誤。</p>
<p>因爲王先生對於韻英的知識是從戴東原得來的，他由敎說而去檢出了玉海所引集賢記注和南部新書。戴東原引南部新書說「陳庭堅撰韻英十卷」，而王先生所引却是「陳友元廷堅撰韻英十卷」，可見他是檢過原書的。但我們不知道他所檢的是什麼版本，因爲就我手頭的學津討源和粵雅堂叢書裏兩種南部新書的戊集，都明明說是：</p>
<p>天寶時，翰（學津本誤作朝）林學士陳王友元庭堅撰韻英十卷，未施行而西京陷胡（粵雅本誤作明，於下增年字），庭堅卒。</p>
<p>和太平廣記完全一樣。王先生所據却少了一個「王」字，又如截東原說是「陳廷堅」他火概因先入爲主的關係，把「友元」兩字連讀了，成爲「陳友元」又呌做「陳廷堅」，所以在這篇文章的題目上還呌做「陳廷堅韻英」，而在文章裏就說「元庭堅」或「陳友元處堅」，未知孰是，其人均無可考。似如王先生早就知道是「陳王友元庭堅」，他決不能通「陳王友」這個官名都不懂的。（實際上，他把我的說法寫在　眉時，已經知道「元廷堅」是對的了。）這種輕易改竄別人文　，英罪行是不可恕的。</p>
<p>其實南部新書這一部書，本都是書人雜記的節錄，這一條應當是卽錄牛肅紀聞。牛氏這書陸心源藏過，今未見，太平御覽四百六十元庭堅條說：</p>
<p>唐翰林學士陳王友元庭堅者，昔罷遠州參軍，於州界居山讀書，……，庭堅由是曉音律，善文字，當時莫及。陰陽術數無不通達。在翰林，撰韻英十卷，未施行而</p>
<p>西京陷胡，庭堅亦卒焉。這一段就引紀聞，首尾和南部新書，只有幾個字不同，可以爲證。</p>
<p>牛肅把元庭堅懂得音律文字，稅做烏王敎的，雖然是神話，但是他把元庭堅的生平說得比較詳細，我們可以知道他先做過遂州參軍，後來是翰林學士陳王友，（陳王是玄宗的兒子陳王珪），在翰林做韻英，還沒有施行而西京陷胡，這是至德元年（西元七五六），庭堅也在那時死了。</p>
<p>我們回過來看韋述集賢注記所說「天寶末，上以自古用韻，不甚區分，陸法言切韻又未能　革，乃改撰韵英，仍舊爲五卷」，和唐會要：「天寶十四年四月，出御撰韵英五卷，付集賢院繕寫行用。」又新唐書藝文志玄宗韻英五卷下所注「天賓十四載撰，詔集賢院寫付諸道採訪使」等話，和元庭堅韻英的時代完全相同。元庭喂是那時的翰林學士，又是精通聲韻的，唐玄宗改撰韻英，捉刀的人，除了他還有誰？據新唐書，玄宗韻英是天寶十四載撰，詔集賢院寫付諸道採訪使，天寶十四載安祿山已經陷東京，明年陷西京，所以牛氏紀聞說「未施行」，這是元延堅韻英就是玄宗韻英或天寶韻英的明證。如果元廷堅的韻英，只是要和皇帝爭夫的私人的著作，那就決說不到「施行」了。至於集賢注記和唐會要唐書都說五卷，而牛氏紀開說十卷，這只是牛氏所見的把一眷分作兩卷，不足爲異。</p>
<p>玄宗韻英私元庭堅韵英旣只是一本書，戴東原王靜安兩氏把舊韻四百三十九歸於廷堅本的說法當然是錯誤的，我在王仁煦切韻的跋裏曾經指出這所謂舊韻，還是指陸法言切韻，不過是韻類而不是韻目。（陸書只有一百九十三韻）這「韵」字，等於「爲奇益石，分作四章」的「章」字。</p>
<p>黃淬伯先生知道陳廷堅的陳宜作元（不過他沒有檢南部新書），也知道「廷堅成書，亦在天寶之季，何得謂之爲舊」，但是他還相信，天寶韵英和元廷堅韻英是兩部書。因爲他所做的是「　琳一切經音義反切攷，」他把反切系聯起來的結果，韵目比切韻還少，所以他說：</p>
<p>然則天實的英五百餘部分析之法，與廷堅韻英迴異，兩書固亦不相涉也。</p>
<p>在這裏，我們就得問他這種系聯的方法是不是可以信任？我們只一翻開他的反切四聲表，第一個「霸」字，一共有九疑，九宜，幾宜，記宜，紀宜，居宜，寄宜，京奇等八個反語，這就表示慧琳做書義的時候，並沒有根據一種韻書注音，而是隨手抄集的，景審序說：</p>
<p>古來音反，多以旁紐爲雙聲，始自服虔，元無定旨，吳音與秦音莫辨，淸韻與濁韻難明，至武與縣爲雙聲，企以智爲疊韵，若斯之類，蓋所不取。近有元廷堅韵英及張戠考聲切韻，今之所音，取則於此。</p>
<p>他明明說取則於這兩種書，但黃先生却偏要說專依廷堅韻英，這是很難使人相信的。</p>
<p>不過就是在這些亂雜的材料裏，我們也能看出嶺英何以比陸法言添出一百五十多類來。景審說：「企以智爲疊韵」，是指陸法言的「去智反」說的，企是四等，智是三等。這是元庭堅張戠等分韻類比陸法言精密的一點。唇音字在切韻裏本有獨立的韻類，不過不很致，到　琳書裏都獨立了。喉牙音，舌音，齒音，在切韻裏間或也有獨立的，在　琳書裏的反切，這種傾向更顯著了。那末，韻英增爲五百八十類，是所用反語上下字比陸法言還要精密的結果。慧琳所用反語的糸統旣不純粹，所音的字又不能把每個小紐都包括在內，要從這一堆材料裏找完全而精密的韻英系統，本是不可能的。而且從戴東原起一直到黃先生都把五百八十韻認爲是東冬之別，而不知道是紅中之別，所以永遠想不出這麽多的韻，是怎麼來的了。</p>
<p>現在，我們可以斷定「玄宗部英」就是「元廷堅韻英」，因安史之亂沒有流行，只有慧琳因秦音系統而採用過，後來就亡佚了。</p>

<p>— 冉昭德</p>
<p>適之先生：</p>
<p>日昨在二月七日申報「文史」第九期上，讀到大著「群書治要裏的晋書」，先生認爲治要所收的晋書是臧榮緒的晋書，其證據是：</p>
<p>我看黃　輯的各家晋書「漢學堂逸書考（？）」，參考房玄齡傳說的「以臧榮緒晋書爲主」一句話，再用今本唐修晋盡對勘，我可以猜想羣書治要收的晋書是臧榮緒的晋書。……試用治要的晋書的劉毅傳（西晋的劉毅），與黃爽所輯臧書劉毅傳，與今本晋書劉毅傳，三本相比較；再用這三本的陶侃傳相比較；就可以知道治要所收的晋書是喊榮緒的晋書……」</p>
<p>先生由猜想而比較所得的結論，是一點也不錯的，但這個問題，前人已有定論；我們似乎不應再作一番考證工作了。</p>
<p>聚學軒叢書第三集裏收有　城張聰咸的「經史賞疑錄」，內有一篇「與阮侍郎論晋逸史例」，是討論羣書冶要所收的晋書的問題，張氏共舉出六條證據，因而判斷　微所引是臧榮絡的晋書，　節錄於后，備作參考。</p>

<p>— 張總咸</p>
<p>承視以唐魏徵群書治要所引晋書以下諸傳，皆貞觀以前之本，可備補逸。今考晋自中興及劉宋，東西（晋）各爲一書，自南齊贓氏始合撰爲一家之史，群陳以下唐初凡引史者準稱晋書，皆臧氏書也。……新唐書太宗紀貞觀十年，詔司空房元（玄）齡等修晋書，（按兩會書太宗紀都不載重撰晋書事），以臧榮緒晋書爲本，採摭諸家紀傳而益附之，故魏徵所引晋書紀志傳與元齡本所載略同，蓋臧氏書也。淺人見其所引紀志與今本次第相類，竟視爲房等之書，錢曉徵宮詹要以魏徵書爲僞撰，殆未之審矣。梁陳及唐初引臧氏晋書者，多不署臧氏之書猶唐人引范氏後漢書者，多不署范氏之書也。……魏徵書引帝紀起文帝終簡文帝，文帝西晋之第三世，蘭文帝東晋之第八世，此臧氏合撰之書可證者一也。魏微書引后妃傳，房等書亦作傳，此臧氏書爲元齡所本，可證者二也。西晋如王隱書作后妃紀，用華嶠後漢書例，房等書獨作傳，是仍贓氏之舊，可證者三也。榮緒書分紀錄志傳，今房等書之志，亦本舊例，故魏微引背書有刑法志，百官志，若西晋王隠書志作記，如地道記，見水經注，東晋之何法盛書百官志作百官表，用前漢班書例，（原注）見北堂書鈔）房等仍臧氏諸志，而魏氏即採引臧書，非王隠何法盛之書，可證者四也。朱鳳書紀高帝訖元帝，此中興之始，而魏微所引已及於中興以後八世之簡文帝，處預書紀高帝訖明帝，此中興之二世，而魏氏所引及節文帝，距晋祚之終，僅三主耳，此決爲臧氏之書，而非朱鳳處預之書，可證者五也。干寶，陸機，曹嘉之，徐廣，鄧粲，王韶之，劉謙之諸紀，習聲齒，檀道　二陽秋，皆各總其時代遠近之事，無紀錄志傳序例，隋志編入雜史（按隋志編入古史，非雜史），而不與朱，虞，王，何正史同列，魏氏所引益信爲臧氏書，而非干，鄧，曹，徐，陸，王，劉七家之紀，習檀二家之陽秋，可證者六也。有此六證，知魏微所引爲臧氏書，而凡梁陳及隋唐間單引晋書不署何氏者，皆可決爲臧氏之書不疑矣。</p>
<p>張聰成的六條證據，只就各家晋史的體例與起訖立論，雖沒用各書本的比較工作，但已足證明羣書治要裏的晋書決爲臧榮緒的晋書了。未悉先生對於這種說法有無修正或補充的意見？專此敬頌撰安冉昭德拜啓（三月十二日於西安西北大學）</p>
<h3 id="c143">後記 <a href="#c143" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e143" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">143</a></h3>
<p>— 胡適</p>
<p>冉昭德先生介紹桐城張聰成「與阮侍郎論晋漁史例」一篇，我很感謝。張聰咸推測群書治要的晋書是臧榮緒的晋書，這是在當時很難得的見解。但老輩學者做考證，往往不很明瞭他們自已用的方法，故方法上往往不很細密。即如張氏所舉六證，其第二，三，四證，都不够作證據。例如第二證說：「魏微書引后妃傳，房等書亦作傳，此贓氏書爲玄齡所本，可證者二也。」這一顯的證據是不能呌人心服的。</p>
<p>張氏的第一，五，六設是可以成立的。但這些都偏重反證、證明治要所收的不是朱，虞，干，鄧，諸人的書。正面的證據似乎還不够。</p>
<p>所以我不能贊同冉先生說的「這個問題，前人已有定論，我們似乎不應再作一番考證工作了」。因爲這個問題前人未有定諭，所以輯佚的人至今還不認治要所採是臧榮緒的晋書。所以我提議用比勘內容的方法，嚴格的證明治要的晋書確是臧書。經過了這一番「者證工作」，這個問題才可以有定論了。</p>

<h3 id="c144">也談節約 <a href="#c144" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e144" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">144</a></h3>
<p>— 靖文</p>
<p>據說當局又要禁止奢侈品了，尼　絲襪以及舶來化裝品等即將定斯禁售，違者將受沒收處分。數月前報紙上似乎也曾有過類似的消息，但結果除了促成居奇，使這類商品的價格提高之外，就別未見到任何效果。此番的功效如何，大概也可以「拭目以待」的。</p>
<p>値此大衆生活艱難時期，對於少數人的窮奢極侈的生活，自應予以制約，但鋻於歷次節約運動的失敗，制約的方式顯有變更的必要。過去的制約方式，每側重於形式的硬性規定，例如海關對於若千類的奢侈品定有禁止輸入的明文，對查獲的私貨則予以沒收處分。然而此類被沒收的私貨，最後仍以海關拍賣方式流入市塲。據傳狡黠者流，更有自行販運遠禁私貨，自行密報海關，然後在海關舉行拍賣時再予收買，於是既獲密吿獎金，又得「合法」以高價出　其貨物，一轉手間獲得巨利，而儼然以合法商人將本求利之身份自居。今日市上舶來奢侈品所以來源不絕，一部份實由於此。</p>
<p>惟尼隆與密絲佛陀之類，究　　片嗎啡。就當前一般國民經　情形言，此類東西雖跡近奢侈　　，但若人人而有此消費能力，則已去國富民强之境不遠矣。事實上一國經濟的繁榮，亦即取決於其國民消費的能力。而求生活美化與舒適，更應說是人類文明的目的。喫些罐頭食品，水果與奶粉之類，以嚴格的經濟律則　，根本不能謂是奢侈，而僅是正常的消費而已。</p>
<p>不過這裏却有一個先決條件，即是國民經濟的消費能力必須使之平均化。尼隆絲襪與密絲佛陀化妝品之類的本身，並不能說是者侈品，祇有在因少數人穿了尼隆絲襪而呌千萬人赤脚，因少數人臉上的光彩而令千萬人面有菜色時，這種東西才成爲是奢侈品。現在當局要嚴行節約生活，禁止此類商品出售，當然也是根據於此。</p>
<p>今日國內的都市生活，到處可以發見「朱門酒肉臭，路有凍死骨」的矛盾現象。這不僅暴露了國民經濟的嚴重弱點，且使社會的鴻溝日益深刻。民氣消沉與人心不安，都可以在這種不平衡的國民經濟生活中找到其原因。</p>
<p>然而僅僅是禁止出售奢侈品，是不曾有甚麼效果的。在一個尊車私有財產制度的國家中，你就不能干涉一個人支配其財產的自由。有錢人就個個抱有「大爺有的是錢，你能管得了我！」的態度，而生意人祗要有利可圖，更顧不得官貨私貨。何况即使抄到了一打尼隆絲襪，究竟也不會犯甚麽殺頭罪。君不見所謂節約菜者，至今又是甚麼結果乎：我預料到某些所謂奢侈品在一朝禁售令下後，一定交易更甚，至多使賣買方式比較「地下化」耳。</p>
<p>鄙意認爲與其官樣文章的下禁令，不若模仿戰前蘇聯所行的專賣制，即在各大都市由國家經營若于專賣高貴舶來奢侈品的特殊商店，特別提高其售價。一面禁止普通商店出售此類商品，違者不僅沒收其商品，且處以極重之罪。而以此種國營商店的營利听得，撥充有益國民福利的事業。至於被列爲專賣奢侈品的種類，可視一股人民的生活水準而予增减。</p>
<p>這樣做有幾種好處。第一是可使需要者滿足其所需，而一樣是消耗外匯，其利益則爲社會所得。其二，如果定價高到令有錢人亦爲之望而却步，那便可說是寓禁於徵了。</p>
<p>也許有人會說：這樣一來，社會的鴻溝將更深了，國家而專賣奢修品，豈非等於公開承認特權人物的存在？但鄙意認爲此事無關重要。現在買得起奢侈品的本來是少數人，如果中國而人人都有享受目前所稱舶來奢侈品的能力，則早就不成其爲奢侈品。而對於這輩少數人，勸導式的節約與硬性的禁售，是不會起甚麽作川的。所以反不若公開承認他們的特殊地位，以高價專賣的方法，或能略收制裁的效果。</p>
<p>不過，就經濟原理言，節流原是不得已的事，最好是能够注重開源。一國的經濟政策，如果專門在减少人民的消費與事受上動腦筋，已够說一聲可憐。尤其是提倡節約而依舊讓少數人過那窮奢極侈的生活，則更應說是不合理。如果我們認眞想談節約，那就應該學學戰後英國的榜樣。他們所行的節約政策，才是同時着眼於開源節流的政策。要是我們的當局沒有這份勇氣，則不妨採納鄙意，公開承認有錢人的時殊地位，這較之掩耳盜鈴式的節約，或許更實在一些。</p>

<p>— 毛毅</p>
<p>美國的婦女時裝業中心雖然在紐約，但是，時裝業的巨擘却不在紐約，而是德克薩斯州的首府達拉斯城的「尼曼馬克司商店」。它每星期於午飯時間在培克旅館舉行一次時裝展覽，許多闊太太不辭跋涉，趕來觀光；它每一年對　剪最出色的縫工頒獎，紐約的　　對這些新聞都以大幅刋載。</p>
<p>尼曼馬克司商店不但以時裝聞名，也以奢華聞名。這裏出售一萬六千五百元一件的皮裘，六百九十五元一製的衣服，七十五元一隻的手袋，一百六十元一頂的帽子，一百五十元一方的手帕，還有四萬八千元一條的籃寶石項圈—標　當然都是以美金爲單位。</p>
<p>使這家商店成功的是揮霍的德薩斯人。他們經營石油，麥子，牛羊，或者棉花發了財，花幾千元甚至幾萬元是無所謂的。</p>
<p>商店有一次登報出售一隻重二十四點三五克拉的大鑽戒，標價十二萬七千美金。不久就有了主顧，他在一張普通的明信片上寫道：　請將廣吿所載之鑽戒送下，價款記入敝人帳戶」—一筆大交易就這樣輕易的成交了，</p>
<p>每年聖誔節，尼曼馬克斯商店都裝飾得勾心鬥角，去年是以「白色聖誕節」爲主題。一櫥窗的佈置全是白的：一棵白羽毛的聖誕樹，掛着一隻閃耀的白鑽手鐲，四週佈置着奇幻的白色禮物，從銀狐長袍到乳白玻璃的桌上用具，樣樣皆全。一個年靑的油業鉅富看見了，他毫不猶豫的命商店在聖誕節的前夕把整個櫥窗內的貨物完全搬到他家裏去，代價是三萬五千美金。</p>
<p>達　期的居民不過四十五萬人，但是，石汕餵肥了他們，每年時裝的消耗就達一千二百萬金元，窮奢極侈可見一斑。</p>

<p>— 錢大成</p>
<p>孟東野有一首詩，題目呌「偸詩」，讀了數十遍，竟不知道怎樣解釋；他的用意所在，更不曉得；我想他一定有所指的。但是偸詩的事實，古已有之，今亦不免，文章的抄襲更是司空見慣。相傳嶺南三大家之一的屈翁山，偸過一個和尙的詩，樊樊山拿了李越縵日記數册，所以始終藏匿不出，其最大原因，是拿那數册日記中的李詩完全抄襲去了。前十年有妄人某，竟大偸而特偸，非但偸今人的詩，更偸古人的詩，竟偸到家喩戶曉的　定會身上，未免太胆大了。近時詩人陳伯英也被他偸去數十首。他憤怒已極，在那「雅賊」的煌煌詩集上，戯題了五首四言詩，喜笑怒罵，大可解頤，抄在下面：「一編跳出，龍翔鳳舞，悉有來歷，似杜工部。（其一）取五侯鯖，成一家言，生天成佛，是曰慧根。（其二）以我腕下，來君筆要，熟極而流，亦云知己。（其三）蛾眉善妬，好漢相得，卿本佳人，奈何作賊？（其四）析骨還父，析肉還母，哪吒太子，紅運白藕。（其五）」此人拿人家的悼亡詩也抄去，但他本人當時年纔弱冠，尙未娶妻呢。可發一笑。當時詩壇領袖如陳石遺老人金松岑先生都爲矇蔽，甚至拿他和易實甫相比，稱爲神童；其實此人也太好名了。同時我更想到隋煬帝爲了愛好他臣子（記得是薛道衡？）的「空梁落燕泥」一句詩，而想奪取牠；奪取不能，妬忌之極，竟把那臣子害死，同時更說：「你現在還能做「空梁落燕泥」嗎？」以帝王之尊，爲了愛好一句詩，竟大動妬勁，揆其用心，實在難以解釋。大約他深切感到如曹不所說：「年壽有時而盡，榮樂止乎其身，二者必至之常期，未若文章之無窮」吧？這也是文字獄方面的奇特鏡頭，古今少有。愛了人家的詩，而起偸竊的念頭和行動，還算是懦弱者的所作所爲。相傳龍陽才子易實甫愛好八指頭陀寄禪咏鬼詩中的一句「窺窗生綠影」，想向寄禪收買，寄禪竟加以拒絕。易實甫自己的詩其實比寄禪好得多，眞是莫明其妙，但竟傳爲佳話。魯迅說：「文章自己的好。」也未必完全確實，有人感到同老婆一樣，也是人家底好的。世界上旣然有竊玉喩香，當然也會有偸詩的事情發生了。因爲好名而偸詩，較之想稿費而抄襲人家文章，我終還偏袒偸詩的雅賊。</p>

<p>按「咨」之名詞與川法，本於前代，而一令」則創行自民國。舊時上行下用札飭，下行上用申詳禀，平行則用「咨」「移」。民國上行下川「令」，號令也，命令也，義固甚妥。而在舊時惟軍營有令，政界則空見。而舊時之「申·詳·禀」皆廢。（老袁時會改定上官行下僚用「飭」，下屬對上官用「詳」，只總統對羣下可用「令」。故舊名相沿歷民國三十餘年至今仍用者，惟「咨」而已。</p>
<p>民國之初，對大總統川「咨」者厥惟國會，其理由一則兩院議員議長皆由選舉，二則立法與行政相並而不相屬，彼時之國會，職權膨脹，氣燄包天。所有「制憲」「選舉總統」各大典，皆由兩院的議員聯合組織行之，無殊包辦。而　察糾彈，又可逕咨元首，是不但立法機關，直像太上政府，固屬火不合理。現在制度已全盤改正，「制憲」與「大選」屬於國代大會，立法與監察亦分爲兩院，固已羅羅淸楚。立法院於行政院長有同意權，監察院於司法院考試院之長亦有同意權，是蓋尊重選舉，爲民主意義之一徵。則「立」「監」二院之體制，雖與三院平行，而公文程式不能不略有區別，良有以也。</p>

They discovered at least 1,500 bandits crossing north at Xinyang Port, east of Yancheng, and strafed and bombed them, destroying a pontoon bridge. Many bandit ships near the pontoon bridge were also sunk. Because the area is a coastal sandy beach, the bandits had difficulty moving and had no cover, so they remained under the control of the Yellow Sea air groups.</p>

<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 28th] At the fifth meeting of the Legislative Yuan on the 28th, Vice President of the Legislative Yuan Chen Lifu bid farewell to all the legislators, preparing to go to the United States to participate in the tenth anniversary meeting of the World Moral Re-Armament Movement held in Hollywood on June 2nd and 3rd. In his letter of request for leave to President Sun (Ke), Chen stated that he had discussed the issue of world peace with Mr. Sun Yat-sen. At that time, Mr. Sun told him that world peace could be obtained from the ancient Chinese way, but at that time Mr. (Chen Lifu) still believed that economic and military power could achieve the purpose of peace. After a long period of research and factual lessons, Mr. (Chen Lifu) finally accepted Mr. Sun Yat-sen's opinion. The purpose of the Moral Re-Armament Movement is to establish a peaceful world order by renewing individuals, strengthening families, and promoting harmonious labor-management cooperation, eliminating totalitarian politics, which coincides with the consistent path of self-cultivation, family regulation, state governance, and world peace in our country. This anniversary meeting has invited people from all walks of life around the world to participate. Mr. Chen did not originally intend to leave the country at the beginning of the implementation of the Constitution, but he was invited by celebrities from both houses of the United States Congress and there were special people who came to the east to invite him, so it was not convenient to refuse. He asked President Sun and colleagues to share the burden of affairs within the Legislative Yuan. Mr. Chen concluded: On this trip, he will also investigate the operation of American party politics and report his experiences to the people of the country after returning home, so that they can learn from it. After the speech, the audience applauded warmly to express their farewell. President Sun also hoped that Mr. Chen could return in triumph before the end of the first session of the meeting and share the legislative tasks.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 28th] Chen Lifu is scheduled to leave Nanjing for Shanghai by night train on the 29th and transfer to the United States. The accompanying staff members have been determined to be Hu Jianzhong and Chen Shifu.</p>

<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 28th] Weng Wenhao flew back to Nanjing from Shanghai by China Airlines plane at 9:50 AM on the 28th to continue consulting on the selection of personnel for the various ministries and commissions of his new Executive Yuan. He also went to the official residence at 4:30 PM to meet with the President for instructions, and did not leave until an hour later. According to reliable sources, the list of the new Executive Yuan will be announced within one or two days, but the position of Vice President has not yet been resolved. Weng went to Shanghai on the 27th to invite Gu Mengyu to serve as Vice President, but Gu declined. After Weng returned to Nanjing, Lei Zhen, Yu Hongjun, Dao Xian Guang, and others visited him one after another to discuss matters. Regarding the participation of the Democratic Socialist Party and the Youth Party, after Lei Zhen visited Weng, he went to Shanghai in the afternoon to discuss matters and may have made a decision. It is also learned that the position of Deputy Secretary-General of the Executive Yuan was originally intended for Wu Zhaohong. Considering that Wu has served as Director of the National Resources Commission (NRC) for many years, he will still be heavily relied upon and may assist Sun Yueqi in serving as Vice Chairman of the NRC. Therefore, the position of Deputy Secretary-General of the Executive Yuan will be selected separately. Furthermore, Jia Jia Gan, former Director of Finance of Taiwan, left Shanghai for Nanjing by night train on the 28th after receiving a telegram from Weng Wenhao.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 28th] There is no problem with He Yingqin's appointment as the Minister of National Defense of the new Executive Yuan. After Weng Wenhao personally invited him to Shanghai on the 27th, He Yingqin returned to Nanjing with Weng on the morning of the 28th at 9:50 AM. At noon, Bai Chongxi went to He's residence to discuss matters for a long time. Gu Zhutong also visited at about 3:00 PM for about half an hour. At about 8:00 PM, He was summoned to the official residence to meet with the President.</p>
<p>[Our Report] Executive Yuan President Weng Wenhao finished his public affairs in Shanghai and flew back to Nanjing by regular flight at 8:20 AM yesterday with General He Yingqin and Nanjing Mayor Shen Yi. Mr. Gu Mengyu is still staying in Shanghai. Although there are many speculations that he has agreed to join the cabinet, Gu's family does not think that Gu will go to Nanjing in the short term. Zhang Jia'ao, the outgoing Governor of the Central Bank, visited President Weng at about 6:00 PM the night before last.</p>

<p>[Our Chengde Dispatch, 28th] The situation in western Rehe is becoming more tense. A major battle is brewing around Chengde. 50,000 bandits continue to approach the periphery. The National Army is shortening its defensive line, concentrating its forces, controlling the mountains, and waiting for an opportunity to strike. Part of the garrison in Longhua broke through, while another part is reportedly fighting the bandits in bloody combat. It is also reported that subsequent bandit troops fled west from Chifeng. Officials are currently investigating.</p>
<p>[Our Beiping Dispatch, 28th] A spokesman for the North China Suppression Headquarters said: The focus of the North China battle is Chengde, which has been completely militarized. In the battle of Xiabancheng on the 27th, more than 3,000 bandits from the Eighth Column were killed or wounded. The current operational goal of the National Army is not the gain or loss of strongholds, but to concentrate its main force for field battles. It is also learned that the National Army on the Pinggu Line continues to clear out the area. On the 27th, more than 100 bandits were killed or wounded northeast of Changping. The railway has been repaired and reopened today. Furthermore, the National Army south of Tianjin annihilated a bandit battalion northeast of Shengfang on the 27th.</p>

<p>[Our Report] Regarding the issue of the Democratic Socialist Party and the Youth Party participating in the Executive Yuan, the two parties made more concrete decisions on the 28th. There is basically no problem with the Youth Party's participation. Zuo Shunsheng is scheduled to leave Shanghai for Nanjing today. According to reliable sources: Lei Zhen telephoned the Chairman of the Democratic Socialist Party, Zhang Junmai, yesterday morning, informing him that the Youth Party had agreed to the compromise plan of 41 legislators, which is half plus one more than the number guaranteed by the Kuomintang. The original plan was to announce the list within three months, but now it has been decided to announce the entire list within two months. After the Youth Party joins the new cabinet, it will still retain the Ministries of Agriculture and Forestry and Economic Affairs. As for the attitude of the Democratic Socialist Party, it still insists on the original proposal, that is, it will not talk about joining the new cabinet until the issue of the number of legislators is satisfactorily resolved. It is heard that Zhang Junmai told Lei Zhen: "President Weng believes that forming a cabinet is an urgent matter and needs to be completed within three or four days. The issue of legislators can be discussed at length. Therefore, he hopes to discuss the issue of forming a cabinet first. Please tell President Weng that our party does not intend to participate in the Executive Yuan for now, so as not to cause him any concerns during the process of forming the cabinet." Xu Fulin and Yang Junming took the train to Nanjing last night to formally convey the decision of the party's consultation in Shanghai.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 28th] Due to the demands of the Democratic Socialist Party and the Youth Party that the problem of adding their members to the Legislative Yuan be resolved simultaneously, there were no results on the 28th. Lei Zhen suggested negotiating for 30 to 40 legislative members from each party, which the Youth Party has indicated it may consider. The Youth Party believes that if the number of Youth Party legislators can reach about 20, similar to that of the Democratic Socialist Party, and the Democratic Socialist Party expresses its willingness to attend the Legislative Yuan, the Youth Party can also attend and participate in the Executive Yuan at the same time.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 28th] After the implementation of the Constitution, the various Yuan, Ministries, and Commissions of the government, except for the Legislative Yuan and the Control Yuan, will be established one after another after the new Executive Yuan is established. It is learned that members of the Examination Committee of the Examination Yuan and Grand Justices of the Judicial Yuan will be recruited from the Democratic Socialist Party and the Youth Party. The selection of personnel for the Presidential Advisors, National Policy Advisors Commission, and Strategic Advisors Commission will be discussed after the Executive Yuan is established.</p>

<p>Disputes Arose During the Meeting</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 28th] Based on the rules of organization of the Constitutional Supervision Committee decided by the Preparatory Committee on the 26th, a meeting was held at 3:00 PM on the 28th to review the rules of organization, chaired by Jiao Yitang. However, the rules of organization being reviewed were drafted by the committee itself, not the ones announced by the Presidential Palace on the 26th. Therefore, a fierce debate broke out among the more than 30 representatives present, lasting for nearly two hours. Some representatives said: The Presidential Palace has announced the rules of organization, and the members are determined by the representatives themselves and then appointed by the government. Therefore, there is no need to review the rules of organization drafted by this committee. Other representatives insisted that this committee is an organization of the National Assembly, and the government's appointment and provision of treatment is another matter. The rules of organization should still be reviewed. After a long dispute, the review began. Some representatives withdrew on their own, and the remaining representatives passed the articles one by one. The second article still stipulates that the members of this committee are determined by the representatives themselves and sent to the government for appointment, because only by being appointed by the government can they receive treatment. However, the committee was originally scheduled to be established on June 1st, but it may have to be postponed. Hong Lanyou, Secretary-General of the National Assembly, sent a letter to the committee, elaborating on this matter.</p>

<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 28th] Legislators Lu Fu and more than 60 others submitted the "Draft of the Provisional General Rules for Provincial and County Autonomy" to the Legislative Yuan on the 28th, totaling 33 articles.

Furthermore, Chapter 11, "Local System," requires that both provincial autonomy laws and county autonomy laws be based on the provisional general rules for provincial and county autonomy. If these general rules can be enacted into law as soon as possible, constitutional governance can be expected to be universally implemented throughout the country, and not just the central government being constitutionally generated.</p>

The news agency said that the newly appointed Soviet Ambassador to China, Luo Shen, had a triple mission: to restore peace talks between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party, to ask the Chinese government to allow Inner Mongolian autonomy, and to assist China in restoring Northeast railway transportation.

Chairman Sun Ke said: The report of the Special Review Committee includes four parts. In order to save time, it is proposed to discuss each part one by one. The legislators then spoke one after another, expressing positive and negative opinions on the issue of convening committee members in Part A of the first part of the Special Review Committee report. After a heated discussion, at 11:40 AM, Zhang Daofan proposed a compromise plan, advocating five points: (1) Convening committee members should be determined by lottery; (2) The term of office for convening committee members should be one session; (3) The scope of the lottery should be the first committee members who volunteer to participate; (4) Each legislator can only register for one committee and be willing to serve as a convening committee member; (5) This method should be tested during this session. Chairman Sun Ke said: In order to save time on the issue of the convening committee members of each committee, can the compromise plan proposed by Committee Member Zhang Daofan be put to a vote?

<h3 id="e27">Vietnam on the Road to Division <a href="#e27" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c27" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">27</a></h3>
<p>The long-standing Vietnam issue has now entered a new stage of division. According to the Central News Agency, the new Central Provisional Government of Vietnam was declared established in Saigon on the 20th of this month, with pro-French General Nguyen Van Xuan as Prime Minister, and announced that Annam's abdicated King Bao Dai was "His Majesty." According to Nguyen Van Xuan: The cabinet will be formed in June, and the list of cabinet members can be announced after being approved by Bao Dai. According to Saigon news: The new government has a total of 22 members, with Nguyen Van Xuan concurrently serving as Minister of National Defense, nine from Cochinchina, seven from Tonkin, and six from Annam. The new government initially planned to be located in the palace in Hue, the capital of Annam, but it has now been changed to Hanoi, and its ruling area includes the three regions of Tonkin, Annam, and Cochinchina. Judging from the above reports, the new government of Vietnam was established with the support of France and was not produced through a general election; therefore, it cannot be regarded as being produced in response to public opinion. Moreover, after the abdicated King Bao Dai of Annam is restored to his position, he will be a monarch above the power of the government, and whether he is supported by the people is even more questionable. In the future, the relationship between Vietnam and France will be that of an autonomous territory; the relationship between the new government of Vietnam and the Viet Minh led by Ho Chi Minh will be that of a confrontation between the North and South Dynasties. This point alone is enough to illustrate that Vietnam is on the road to division in terms of territory and politics. In the history of the Far East, this is another tragedy after the division of Korea!</p>
<p>Vietnam is a fertile land in Southeast Asia. Geographical, political, and historical factors have created a tragedy of shifting fortunes for five centuries. In 1471, the Annamese destroyed Champa, at the end of the 15th century they reached Quy Nhon, in 1611 they reached Dang Trong, in 1663 they reached Phan Rang, in 1697 they reached Binh Thuan, and in 1698 they reached Saigon. Finally, in the first half of the 19th century, they were ruled by France, and in the early 20th century, they were invaded by Japan and Siam. For more than 400 years, Vietnam has not been the unified country that the Vietnamese hoped for. Professor Zhu Kezhen compared Vietnam to a dumbbell, which actually contains geographical and historical significance. After World War II, the surging revolutionary movement in Vietnam, from the outside to the inside, and with internal and external cooperation, unearthed Ho Chi Minh. According to the "Vietnam Independence League" led by Ho Chi Minh, abbreviated as Viet Minh, their insistence on Vietnam's independence and unification of the three regions is fundamentally inconsistent with France's policies, resulting in multiple French-Vietnamese negotiations failing to reach an agreement. The French-Vietnamese preliminary agreement of March 6, 1946, and the French-Vietnamese temporary agreement of September 15 of the same year, were torn up after they were established, leading to war. It is undeniable that the French-Vietnamese war has been going on for a year and a half, and France's plan to conquer the Viet Minh by force has failed. The French army has nothing to do with Ho Chi Minh's guerrillas in the remote mountains and wilderness. Furthermore, due to France's own fragility, poor domestic economy, and the development of political disputes, France is deeply burdened by the military burden in Vietnam and cannot continue to extend the situation in Vietnam, and is seeking another way to "peacefully" resolve the situation.</p>
<p>France's countermeasure for "peacefully" resolving the Vietnam issue is to first support the right-wing forces in southern Vietnam in order to counter Ho Chi Minh and split the united front of the Viet Minh. Then, it will try to win over the abdicated King Bao Dai of Annam and support his restoration to rule the three regions. Bao Dai is the 13th, and also the last, emperor of the Nguyen Dynasty of Annam (1802-1945), and is only 37 years old this year. In August 1945, due to the trends of the domestic and international situation, he could not continue his throne and finally announced his abdication, which was praised by the people of Vietnam at the time. Bao Dai lived in Hong Kong, and France continued to maintain contact with him. Last year, he held preliminary negotiations with France. On the one hand, he naturally wanted to ascend the throne, and on the other hand, he also wanted to peacefully resolve the situation in Vietnam with France, but the result was not satisfactory. Although he and French Commissioner Bollaert signed an informal agreement on a French warship in Hạ Long Bay, there were only principles in it. Later, Bao Dai flew to London and then to Geneva to conduct concrete negotiations with Bollaert, but the negotiations between the two sides suddenly fell into a stalemate again. It is said that Bollaert presented Bao Dai with the following conditions: (1) France supports Bao Dai's restoration and the establishment of a Vietnamese constitutional monarchy government, with Vietnam as an autonomous state under the French Union; (2) Vietnam's diplomatic envoys must be approved by France; (3) The Vietnamese army must be trained by French officers and commanded by France; (4) Bao Dai should protect France's cultural and economic interests in Vietnam. Under these multiple restrictions, Bao Dai's position is completely that of a puppet, and Vietnam's position is completely that of a colony. Although Bao Dai is a noble figure, his thinking is not conservative, and his character and life are very different from that of Pu Yi. Therefore, he rejected France's conditions and quietly left Geneva and returned to Hong Kong.</p>
<p>After Bao Dai returned to Hong Kong, the local government of Vietnam decided to support Bao Dai. The Nguyen-character Vietnamese Unification League is the backbone of the anti-Ho Chi Minh faction. They gathered in Hong Kong to hold meetings, and France and Bao Dai made concessions to each other. The declaration of the establishment of the new government in Saigon on the 20th of this month can be said to be clear evidence that the negotiations between France and Bao Dai are quite mature. The new government of Vietnam is calling for Bao Dai's restoration, but whether Bao Dai will immediately return to Vietnam is not without question. Bao Dai wants to exist by taking advantage of the contradiction between France's opposition to Ho and Ho Chi Minh's opposition to France, and wants to exist by taking advantage of the Vietnamese people's fear of France and communism, but whether he can eliminate Ho Chi Minh's power and balance the complex ethnic disputes in the three regions is also questionable. At present, Ho Chi Minh is still silent about Bao Dai's restoration. If Bao Dai cannot politically win over Ho Chi Minh and "peacefully" resolve the situation in Vietnam after he returns to Vietnam, then the French-Vietnamese war will inevitably turn into a civil war in Vietnam, and the future of Vietnam's independence may become increasingly bleak. In this way, Vietnam's path to division will be the same as the tragedy of Korea, plunging into an irreparable catastrophe, and will make Vietnam a "dumbbell" forever in terms of geography and history.</p>
<h3 id="e28">Principles Determined for Tax Exemption and Taxation of Future International Imports; Ministry of Finance's Proposal Approved by the Executive Yuan <a href="#e28" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c28" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">28</a></h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 28th] The Ministry of Finance believes that the measures for tax exemption and taxation of various international imports fall into the following four categories: (1) Those that should be exempt from taxes according to Sino-foreign agreements, such as post-war relief materials and US relief materials; (2) Those that are ordered to be exempt from taxation, such as Japanese reparations materials and returned materials; (3) Those that are separately exempt from taxation according to regulations, such as enemy and puppet industry materials; (4) Those that are exempt from taxation according to existing cases depending on the nature of the organization and materials used, such as US military surplus materials, which are currently handled by the material supply and handling departments, and should be taxed in principle, but if the organization using the materials has a precedent for tax exemption or bookkeeping, it will still be exempted or booked according to the existing case. The above four categories should be handled separately according to the agreement or special project until the transportation and import of the materials are completed, and it is not convenient to change them midway. However, in the future, new international materials will continue to be received, and the taxation (including commodity tax) can be determined by our government without the restrictions of agreements. It seems appropriate to set a principle to have a standard. The following three points are specifically suggested to the Executive Yuan: (1) Relief materials should be exempt from taxation in principle, but each item should still be submitted to the Ministry of Finance for approval based on the nature and use of the materials and the target; (2) Other international materials should be taxed in principle, but if the nature and use of the materials and the organization using them meet the regulations for tax exemption or bookkeeping, such as military materials, educational supplies, and road-specific materials, they may still be submitted to the Ministry of Finance for approval on a case-by-case basis; (3) In the future, if newly tax-exempted imported materials are processed and sold domestically, the selling price should include taxes, and the proceeds and taxes should be listed separately and reported. It is now learned that the Ministry of Finance's proposal has been approved by the Executive Yuan for implementation and has been notified to relevant agencies. The first meeting was held in Beijing yesterday.</p>

As for rust, the labor costs for rust removal should be deducted from the original price depending on the situation of rust removal; (2) The costs of loading, unloading, storage, insurance, and safekeeping should be added to 6% of the selling price of the materials to cover the actual expenses. If there is any surplus, it will be returned to the purchaser, and if there is a shortfall, the purchaser will make up the difference.</p>

Respectfully to Vice Minister Chu Gong: Yang Mei lost her parents at a young age and lives on distant relatives. According to her, abdominal pain started to occur nine years ago. Since then, she has not thought about eating or drinking, only drinking a little raw water, and it has been like this every day until today. She herself has been an orphan since childhood and does not know her age. According to her guardian's speculation, she is about 21 years old. This matter has caused quite a stir in her hometown. People from far and near come to visit. Yang Mei's guardian, unable to bear the trouble, brought her to Chongqing and lived at Zhuo Songdai's Women's Normal School in Jiulongpo. The matter was heard by the teachers and students of the school, and it was rumored to be a strange thing, alarming Chongqing City. In view of this, our bureau is afraid of spreading rumors and misinformation in society. We sent a special person to consult with the guardian and others and conducted an investigation for a considerable period of time. They agreed and signed a contract, scheduling three weeks to investigate only whether she eats or not. A special person from our bureau accompanies her in life. According to reports, Yang Mei has not been found to eat or show any appetite. Her spirit is as usual, and her weight and spleen pulse have not changed. Her operation is the same as ordinary people, and she talks and laughs freely. There is no stool, only urine. Although her body has not been examined in detail, according to her guardian and herself, she is the same as ordinary people and also has menstruation. Her weight is 84 pounds, but her walking and wrist strength are of the village type. We pray for your instructions on future measures.</p>

<p>[US News Agency Washington Electric Dispatch on the 27th] The Senate Foreign Affairs Committee recently recommended the approval of the Sino-US Treaty of Friendship, Commerce, and Navigation, but reserved the copyright part. The committee said that in this reservation, the United States is prepared to conduct immediate negotiations with China to further improve the copyright issue, paying special attention to the US desire to protect translation rights. The Senate believes that protecting the author of literary and artistic works to retain the exclusive right to translate or authorize the translation of his works is a fair treatment that the author should enjoy. This point is very important, and it is equally important to ensure faithful translation and its faithful presentation to people who must accept it in a language other than the original. Under the current circumstances, this protection is necessary to promote the effective dissemination of literary and artistic works and to encourage responsible industries to produce such works within a country. The report stated that earlier treaties did not stipulate such protection for translated works, and current Chinese laws and regulations do not prohibit the translation of works in order to protect domestic publishing companies and associations. The report also called attention to the fact that the new treaty does not force either party to implement most-favored-nation treatment for copyright matters.</p>

<h3 id="e50">The Climax of the Victory in Eastern Gansu <a href="#e50" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c50" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">50</a></h3>
<p>— Our Reporter Zhang Xianzhou</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper Xi'an Air Dispatch on the 26th] On April 6, the Communist bandits sneaked from south of Yijun to Malan and other places. On the evening of the 17th, they crossed the Jinghe River from Gao Wangzhen and quickly captured Bin County, Changwu, and Yongshou, sweeping across western Guanzhong. At that time, the National Army happened to be concentrated near Tongchuan. Between the Xun River and the Wei River, the terrain is undulating and there are many large valleys, making it difficult for large corps to cross. The Communist bandits saw this point, which was beneficial to them, and immediately took advantage of it.</p>
<p>Three Areas</p>
<p>This battle can be divided into three areas to describe: (1) Bin-Chang-Qian-Yong Area (2) Western Guanzhong (3) Eastern Gansu and Northern Shaanxi.</p>
<p>The victory in the Bin-Chang area was the first result of the cooperation between Ma Jiyuan's troops and the Guojun in Qian County on the southern line. When the Guojun on the southern line pursued with thunderous momentum, Ma Jiyuan's troops set out from Xifeng on April 23 and encountered the bandits on the outskirts of Changwu. The bandit army stationed on the Xi-Lan line was the Sixth Column. After Changwu was captured on the 25th, the bandit army living near Tingkouzhen in southern Bin County panicked because the broadsword cavalry of the entire 82nd Division was famous for killing people. He immediately withdrew the main force of the bandit army to ten miles south of Tingkou. The terrain in Naqiu was very complicated, and the Communist bandits destroyed all the roads in the north in an attempt to prevent the 82nd Division from going south. At that time, this approach was told to the troops by an old man, and the 82nd Division changed its route and detoured from both wings. The cavalry's actions were swift. The Communist bandits were surrounded on the east, south, and west sides. The north road was destroyed, and the air force had just finished its shooting. After being hit by this battle, they were all wiped out. According to a post-war investigation, Cheng Yuechang, the commander of the New Fourth Brigade of the bandit army, was killed in battle. Even the cook of Luo Yuanfa, the commander of their column, was captured. According to his confession, Luo had no way to go when the army collapsed. He ordered an adjutant to shoot him with a handgun, and then the adjutant committed suicide. The Guojun on the southern line recovered Jianjunzhen on the evening of the 25th, and Yongshou joined forces with Ma's division on the morning of the 28th. The war in this area came to an end.</p>
<p>Turning the Tide</p>
<p>The Guojun advancing westward along the Longhai Road attacked the Fourth Column and the Second Column of the bandits from the 25th. The bandit army on the Dao line retreated without a fight. The Guojun smoothly recovered Wugong, Fufeng, and captured Qishan, Fengxiang, and Caijiapo until reaching Baoji on the 27th. The main force of the bandit army fled north into the Xu Mountain and gathered the main force of three columns north of Fengxiang, claiming that they would defeat the Guojun here with superior forces in a superior area and then commit crimes in the east, joining forces with Chen Zaibu outside Xi'an.</p>
<p>At dawn on April 29, the fierce battle began. This was the first time that the bandit army fought a "happy battle" with the Guojun in the Northwest! After nine hours of fierce fighting, the Guojun destroyed the bandit army's position with strong firepower in coordination with the air force. This battle shattered the Communist bandits' dream of establishing the Pangshan Military Region and turned the tide of the entire Northwest war, laying the groundwork for the victory in eastern Gansu. According to the war results announced by the Generalissimo's Office, 1,400 bandits were captured, 500 rifles and more than 30 light and heavy machine guns were seized. The materials looted by the bandits in the Caijiapo area (mainly cloth and daily necessities) were 2,800 carts. More than 800 bandits were killed. The Guojun continued to pursue and suppress in the northeast direction at a pace of 120 li per day. During the same period, the Guojun on the northern line completely wiped out the Sixth Cavalry Division led by Hu Jingduo in Cuimu and Changning.</p>
<p>Peng Dehuai and Zhao Shoushan gave speeches in Malan before fleeing. The purpose of the bandit army was to "expand the liberated areas" and "establish the eastern Gansu base area." If it was absolutely necessary, they would retreat to Liupan Mountain, but when they were defeated in the Battle of Lingshan and then defeated in the Battle of Yongshou, their morale dropped greatly. Outside Jingchuan City, they fell into an empty city trap again. When Peng Dehuai ran south of Jingchuan, he did not know how many Guojun were stationed in the city. He did not dare to commit crimes easily and detoured westward for dozens of miles across the Xizha Road and fled north. In fact, Jingchuan was an empty city at that time, with only a few hundred security teams. Peng was suspicious and suffered on his own. He took a step late, and the Guojun's pursuit and blocking troops all caught up.</p>
<p>Telephone Interlude</p>
<p>The Victory in Eastern Gansu was when the Guojun drove the Communist bandits into a pocket, and Ma Jiyuan rushed up and tied the mouth. When Ma Jiyuan's troops used two regiments to surround the two brigades of the bandit army led by Zhao Shoushan in Tunzizhen, Peng Dehuai quickly led the main force of the Second Column from Yudu Temple and surrounded the troops in the second layer, thus being attacked from both the front and the rear, fighting hard in hand-to-hand combat for three days and nights. At that time, the Guojun's reinforcements going north were engaged in fierce fighting with the bandits in Yudu Lizhen and other places. On the evening of the 6th, there were several interludes: One was that Ma Jiyuan called Li Zhen, the commander of the 65th Division of the Guojun. The former spoke with a Gansu accent, and the latter was in Cantonese. Later, this one shouted "Fight! Fight, fight!" and Hao Ge only replied "Fight! Fight, fight!" "In Yudu," "Sigh, in Yudu!" As a result, they fought. That day was windy. We set out from two places and met in the middle, and there was a small misunderstanding and we started shooting. Both sides were surprised. The bandit army had never been so fierce. Later, they realized that they had made a mistake. One was that the bandit army in Tunzizhen called Master Ma in the name of a certain regiment of the Guojun, asking how many more reinforcements could be transferred to help them and which road they could attack from. As a result, they were seen through, and both sides cursed loudly on the telephone.</p>
<p>Before the occasional division captured Tunzizhen on the evening of May 6, the moon was dark and the wind was high. The Communist bandits escaped from the south ditch of Tunzizhen. When Master Ma entered the city the next day, many bandits had escaped, but all the heavy weapons were left behind. In this battle, the Communist bandits suffered heavy casualties, which was really very heavy. This was the climax of the victory in eastern Gansu.</p>
<p>After the Communist bandits broke through the encirclement, they fled eastward in a panic. The Guojun pursued at a pace of 120 li per day. When the Communist bandits crossed the Ma Canal, they had already collapsed into a disorganized army. From the cut-off documents, it only said to gather in Yan'an. As of the 16th of this month, this big turn was considered complete. According to the war results released by the Xi'an Generalissimo's Office, the Communist bandits suffered 27,000 to 28,000 casualties, 6,525 were captured by us, 4,000 to 5,000 were dispersed, 5,672 rifles, 125 cannons of various types, 443 machine guns, and 4 radio stations were seized. The command posts of the First, Fourth, and Sixth Columns of the bandit army and seven brigade headquarters were dispersed.</p>
<p>Not Proud of the Victory</p>
<p>Shangguan Yeyou, Director of the Political Work Department of the Northwest Generalissimo's Office, summarized the reasons for the great victory in this battle when he received reporters in Jingchuan: The Guanzhong Corps and the Eastern Gansu Corps were closely integrated, the security team and the Guojun cooperated appropriately, the military and civilians and the local government cooperated, the communication was fast and accurate, the supply mechanism was sound, and the power of the air force was used appropriately. As for the future military situation in the Northwest, Commander Ma Shaoxiang (Jiyuan) said it well: The Communist army's supply is a little faster than ours. Although we hit him this time, he will reorganize and replenish himself in half a year, and maybe he will be even fiercer than now. They will definitely carry out a more tragic retaliatory war. This time, we all cooperated to defeat the bandit army. What should we do next time? Now, we can only not be proud of the victory and wait for the storm to come!</p>

<h3 id="e52">Before the Republican National Convention; MacArthur Has No Intention of Returning Home to Report for Duty; Officially Replies to the Chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee; The Call for MacArthur to Be Nominated as a Presidential Candidate Is Very High <a href="#e52" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c52" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">52</a></h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper News] New York Broadcasting on the 28th: Washington News, MacArthur has long been nominated by the Republicans as a presidential candidate. Since the Senate Committee voted yesterday to ask him to return home to present his views, the call to elect MacArthur as president has become even higher than before.</p>
<p>[Associated Press Washington Electric Dispatch on the 28th] MacArthur telegraphed the Chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee, Bridges, today, saying that he was unwilling to return home before the Republican National Convention to nominate a presidential candidate next month. It is said, "If I return home at this time, no matter how sincere the purpose, it will be misunderstood and accused by most people of having a political effect. On the contrary, after the political issue is resolved next month, if you still want me to explain my views on matters of public concern, you can do whatever you want." Bridges declared after receiving the telegram, I understand MacArthur's intention and will submit the reply to the Senate Appropriations Committee as soon as possible.</p>
<p>[Reuters Washington Electric Dispatch on the 27th] The Senate Appropriations Committee recently passed a motion with a vote of seventeen to one, requesting General MacArthur to return to the United States to present his views on the Far East situation to Congress. Earlier, when the Pacific War broke out, General Wainwright, the commander of the US Army stationed in the Philippines, had asked Congress to summon MacArthur to return home to provide opinions on the military needs of the United States in the Far East. General Wainwright led a number of veterans to support MacArthur in running for the Republican presidential nomination. According to Senator Wiley, a member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, who expressed the views of the majority of the committee members, the committee's decision to ask MacArthur to return home had no political motivation. Wiley believes that the US occupation of Japan is a bright spot in US post-war policy and believes that MacArthur will be able to provide Congress with valuable information. According to political figures here, the Senate Appropriations Committee's recall of MacArthur is a clever attempt to restore MacArthur's chances of running, because he was defeated in the primary election in Wisconsin two months ago. MacArthur went abroad before the Pacific War and has not returned to his home country so far. If he returns home now, it will naturally cause a commotion among the general public.</p>
<p>[US News Agency Washington Electric Dispatch on the 27th] Secretary of the Army Royal telegraphed MacArthur today, saying that the Senate Appropriations Committee had passed a motion instructing its chairman, Senator Bridges, to request MacArthur to return to the United States to attend the committee and express his views on the Far East issue. Royal said in the telegram that Bridges proposed June 2 or 3 as the convenient date for "Your Excellency to attend" and said, "Someone has suggested to me that you bring your family with you.</p>
<p>[Chicago News Agency Washington Electric Dispatch on the 27th] President Truman told reporters that he had asked MacArthur to come to Washington to meet, but it depended on whether MacArthur could leave Japan. He hoped that MacArthur could respond to the Senate Committee's invitation to attend and report on the Far East situation. The President also said that he fully agreed with MacArthur's policy and was willing to support him in all aspects.</p>
<p>[Associated Press Tokyo Electric Dispatch on the 28th] The US urging MacArthur to return home today symbolizes the completion of the entire US attempt on the Far East policy. This decision by the Senate Appropriations Committee is very provocative and is almost a tactic against MacArthur. The committee's request for MacArthur to personally state his views on the "Eastern situation" undoubtedly includes three major issues, two of which are directly related to MacArthur. (1) MacArthur's often detailed views on Japan, as an entry point for US support for the Asian economy. (2) The scope and type of continued aid to China; (3) The future US policy towards Korea, especially whether it should continue to occupy South Korea after the recent elections. The mutual response of the United States to the policies of the three countries is becoming increasingly necessary. At the same time, politically, MacArthur's return home this time is the last chance to win the Republican presidential nomination. It has not been hinted whether MacArthur has given up hope for the nomination as a result of the Republican primary election. The US occupation of Japan has entered a relatively peaceful period. Currently, the focus is on expanding economic construction funded by the US, which is the culmination of MacArthur's consistent occupation policy. Therefore, the Senate's invitation is at least timely.</p>

<p>[Reuters Paris Electric Dispatch on the 28th] According to reliable information, the French government has once again protested to the United States regarding the recent US diplomatic means towards the Soviet Union, urging the United States not to carry out the Cold War too hastily.

<p>[French News Agency Washington Electric Dispatch on the 27th] Soviet Ambassador to the United States Pan Youxin said that he had met with US Deputy Secretary of State Lovett today to discuss the issue of resolving the $1.1 billion that the Soviet Union owes under the Lend-Lease Act. The ambassador then said that he would return home soon to receive new instructions from the government on this matter. He also emphasized that the Soviet government will do its best to resolve this matter. According to diplomatic circles, the main reason for the ambassador's recall to Moscow is to consult on Soviet-US relations, because the resolution of the Lend-Lease Act issue can be done through diplomatic channels, without the need for this trip.</p>

<h3 id="e58">Before the Outbreak of War: British Diplomatic Secrets; Soviet Union Publishes Nazi Archives <a href="#e58" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c58" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">58</a></h3>
<p>[United Press, London, 28th] The Soviet Union today accused Britain of allowing Germany freedom of action in Eastern and Southeastern Europe and of returning former African and Pacific territories to Germany in the three months before the outbreak of World War II. Radio Moscow broadcast that the Soviet Ministry of Foreign Affairs had compiled captured Soviet documents into the second volume of "New Documents Before World War II." This includes correspondence and reports from the German Ambassador to Britain, Dirkson, to the German Foreign Office between 1938 and 1939. On August 3, 1939, a month before Germany invaded Poland, Schidt was still discussing the conclusion of a non-aggression and non-interference treaty between Britain and Germany with the British Under-Secretary of State, Wilson. Poach reported to the German Foreign Office that the basis of the Wilson talks remained valid. The conclusion of an Anglo-German agreement could invalidate Britain's guarantees to Poland, Turkey, and other countries. The Dirkson talks also involved raw materials, colonial territories, financial assistance to Germany, and other issues. Later, Poach returned to Germany, and his mission in the Anglo-German negotiations came to an end. Radio Moscow also claimed that the British Cabinet decided in February 1939 to return former German territories to Germany. After Britain protested in March due to Germany's annexation of Czechoslovakia, a series of secret negotiations were held in June and July.</p>
<h3 id="e59">British Representative Suggests Four-Week Truce in Holy Land to Security Council; Israeli Representative Immediately Objects <a href="#e59" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c59" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">59</a></h3>
<p>[Our report] New York, 28th broadcast: Success Lake report, at today's Security Council meeting, China opposed the Soviet Union's proposal for the United Nations to intervene decisively in Palestine, while the United States supported the Soviet proposal. Under the current circumstances, those generally supporting the British proposal for a four-week truce also include Syria and Argentina, while those supporting the Soviet proposal include France, Ukraine, and Colombia, which may also support it. However, it appears that neither proposal can obtain the necessary seven votes to pass.</p>
<p>[Quoque News Agency, Success Lake, 27th] Britain today proposed that all countries ban arms shipments to the Middle East and asked the United Nations Security Council to once again seek a truce in Palestine.</p>
<p>Britain proposed that if the United Nations intends to issue an effective and universal ban on arms shipments to both the Arab and Jewish sides, Britain will cease supplying arms to Iraq, Transjordan, Egypt, and other Arab countries. British representative Cadogan formally proposed a four-week truce in the Holy Land, during which United Nations mediator Bernadotte will attempt to reach a permanent solution acceptable to both the Arab and Jewish sides. The U.S. and the Soviet Union have repeatedly stated that it is now time for the United Nations to intervene more forcefully in Palestine. U.S. officials declined to comment on the British proposal. The Security Council adjourned without discussing the proposal and is scheduled to reconvene on the 28th. The Israeli representative strongly opposed this, and Israel issued a formal statement stating: "The British government's objective is to tie Israel's hands, so that the Arabs are free to defeat Israel."</p>
<p>[U.S. Information Service, Success Lake, 27th] Soviet representative Gromyko requested the Security Council to make a decision that the situation in Palestine constitutes a threat to peace, according to Chapter VII of the United Nations Charter. The Soviet proposal would order both sides to cease fire thirty-six hours after the proposal is passed.</p>
<p>[United Press, Success Lake, 27th] The proposal by British representative Cadogan at the Security Council appears to have been decided after four meetings in London between British Foreign Secretary Bevin and U.S. Ambassador to Britain Douglas, aimed at partially accommodating the Arab side's truce conditions. Cadogan stated that if this reconciliation attempt fails again, Britain will implement coercive measures jointly with other countries.</p>

<p>[Reuters, Washington, 27th] A spokesman for the U.S. Army Air Forces solemnly denied that the nineteen U.S. transport planes that landed on the island of Cyprus yesterday carried American troops. There were only one or two soldiers serving as guards. Regarding the rumor that Britain and the United States are jointly planning to use Cyprus as a naval and air base, the State Department and the U.S. Air Force authorities declined to comment. According to a report by Sulzberger, the chief diplomatic correspondent in Europe for the New York Times, Britain and the United States are secretly drafting a joint plan to enhance Cyprus as a major naval and air base. Cyprus now has facilities capable of accommodating 30,000 troops, and today it has truly begun to suit its terrain as an arrow pointing towards Asia. However, Sulzberger also stated that due to the differences between Britain and the United States over Palestine, this joint plan has also been shaken.</p>

<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 27th] Truman declared today that the matter of lifting the arms embargo to the State of Israel is still under consideration by the government. However, the U.S. will not make any decision on lifting the embargo until the Security Council takes action on the Palestine issue. He said that the embargo on arms to the Middle East was in response to a request from the Security Council, and the United States is waiting for action from the international organization before taking further action. The State of Israel has not applied for a loan. If it does apply, it must go through formal procedures.</p>

<p>[Reuters, London, 28th] Twenty-one British officers serving with the Transjordanian Arab Legion, after withdrawing from Palestine, will continue to perform training duties in Transjordan. According to a British Foreign Office spokesman today, the British government has informed the Transjordanian government, in accordance with the 1948 British-Transjordanian Treaty, that it will withdraw the twenty-one British officers from Palestine. The treaty stipulates that the military assistance obligations between Britain and Transjordan shall not conflict with obligations to United Nations bodies. When asked whether these British officers were only withdrawn from Palestine or whether their service with the Transjordanian Arab Legion had ended, the spokesman replied that they were only withdrawn from Palestine.</p>

<p>[Reuters, Johannesburg, 28th] The United Party led by South African Prime Minister Smuts has lost its majority in the South African Parliament, replaced by the Nationalist Party led by Malan. Smuts himself, in the Standerton constituency where he has held sway for 24 years, also lost to the Nationalist Party's Placy by a margin of 224 votes. Smuts has submitted his resignation to South African Governor-General Van Zyl. Van Zyl has summoned Nationalist Party leader Malan to Pretoria and authorized him to form a new cabinet. The final results of the general election show that the Nationalist Party won 70 seats, the United Party won 65 seats, the Afrikaner Party won 9 seats, and the Labour Party won 6 seats. Observers believe that Smuts' failure was due to farmers' dissatisfaction with the government's control policies, who cast their votes against the ruling party. "The Natal Times" stated that Smuts' recognition of the State of Israel was the reason for his defeat.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Pretoria, 28th] The headquarters of the South African Nationalist Party issued a statement stating that the party does not intend to make substantial changes to the foreign policy recently pursued by General Smuts after taking office. Nationalist Party leader Malan solemnly declared that the party will continue to pledge allegiance to the British King and the British Commonwealth.</p>

<p>[Reuters, Washington, 27th] The State Department instructed the U.S. Ambassador to the Soviet Union two days ago to present to the Soviet government a reply to the Soviet protest against U.S. planes interfering with merchant shipping in the Sea of Japan, rejecting the Soviet protest as baseless. The reply pointed out that none of the fifty-plus incidents listed in the Soviet protest letter could prove that the altitude or position of the U.S. planes constituted interference with merchant shipping. It also stated that according to the Moscow Agreement, General MacArthur has the right to issue all orders for the occupation and control of Japan and to use military force to prevent smuggling and illegal entry. To accomplish this task, it should include monitoring ships at sea with low-flying aircraft.</p>

<p>[Our report] London, 28th broadcast: Jewish forces in the Old City of Jerusalem surrendered on Friday.</p>
<p>[United Press, Tel Aviv, 28th] The Jewish Haganah army announced on the 28th that the main battle in Jerusalem is underway in the Latrun area, with both sides concentrating large forces and fighting fiercely.</p>
<p>[United Press, Tel Aviv, 27th] The Jewish government's new ceasefire order came into effect at 6:00 p.m. standard time on the 27th.</p>
<p>[United Press, Cairo, 27th] In the Old City of Jerusalem, the infantry of the Arab Legion finally entered the Hepha Jewish Synagogue, which had been defended for eleven days, and hoisted the Arab flag. Jews fled in disarray to a rubble-strewn 200-square-foot area. According to the "Voice of Jerusalem," a Haganah radio station in the besieged city, thousands of troops from both sides engaged in fierce fighting in Latrun, a former British detention camp for Jews, and in the Bel Air Huashi gorge, 15 miles west of Jerusalem. Arab political sources in Cairo stated that Egyptian forces have assumed responsibility for the main battle in Jerusalem, assisted by the Arab Legion and irregular forces, and attacked Jerusalem from the south on Thursday morning. However, according to a communique issued in Tel Aviv on Thursday night, Jewish forces launched a fierce counterattack to contain the Egyptian offensive. Arab forces have been driven out of the Malliyah Temple on the Bethlehem Road, and Ramallah has also been retaken by Jewish forces. Furthermore, a dispatch from the Old City of Jerusalem stated that the Arab Legion suffered heavy casualties due to their unfamiliarity with street fighting. However, the occupation of the Jewish Synagogue is likely a prelude to the end of the Old City battle. When the Jewish Synagogue fell, it was reported that 300 women, children, and non-combatants were sheltering in ancient tunnels.</p>

<p>Construction Projects</p>
<p>The State Department's proposed plan is to provide China with 60 million U.S. dollars before June 30, 1949, for the purpose of undertaking several major construction projects. China is currently unable to fund these projects. As for which projects should be selected for implementation, which construction should take priority, or which should be funded first and which later, these issues should be decided by the personnel implementing the plan. However, the following projects have been repeatedly studied, and the committee believes they are urgently needed by China today. These include the Shanghai power supply project, the restoration of the Yuehan Railway and the Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway, and the reopening of coal mines in western Jiangxi and Xiangtan.</p>
<p>Implementing personnel may find that the vast majority of the 363.3 million yuan can be used to carry out various restoration projects that can be continued independently by the Chinese without the need for foreign assistance. In this way, the United States can more accurately observe how American money is being used, while also encouraging private enterprise. For example, with reasonable financial support, taking immediate steps to improve agriculture, with a view to improving agricultural products, rural conditions, and land reform, is something that Chinese and American agricultural experts have long hoped for. China's agricultural economic situation is very different from that of Western Europe, so it must be handled in this way. In addition, we must strive to increase the free transportation of food from rural to urban areas.</p>
<p>Currency Stabilization Issues</p>
<p>Some have discussed providing flexible silver to replace a considerable amount of goods, so if it could be supplemented with some measures, China might restore the coin standard as a step towards stabilizing the currency. One report stated that this approach does not require a large loan, as the total currency in circulation in China in 1947 was estimated to be worth approximately 250 million to 350 million U.S. dollars. Another figure that has been proposed is 600 million ounces of silver, loaned by the United States, to lay the foundation for regulating the appropriate currency.</p>
<p>However, Secretary of State Marshall said that, according to the opinion of our country's monetary experts, providing a currency stabilization fund would require a huge amount, and under the current circumstances of having to deal with war and the fragmentation of the people, most of it would be depleted. It is understood that another report on this topic is currently being prepared for submission to the committee.</p>
<p>China's Repayment of Loans</p>
<p>The committee understands that the Chinese government has never defaulted on any loans it has obtained from the U.S. government. Regarding the 500 million U.S. dollar credit loan to China in 1942, as well as China's other wartime debts, the repayment method will be finalized through negotiations to clear the U.S.-China war debts. At the request of Secretary of State Marshall, the Export-Import Bank had previously scheduled to approve 500 million U.S. dollars as a loan to China, but it was not implemented due to the expiration of the scheduled period on June 30, 1947. After the expiration of this schedule, China submitted several applications for credit loans of a considerable amount, but the bank did not grant them, because it was unable to obtain guarantees of repayment.</p>
<p>The committee is deeply impressed by the Chinese government's creditworthiness in repaying U.S. loans. However, one point should be pointed out: given the National Government's economic situation, most of the assistance proposed under the draft bill must be provided in the form of grants.</p>
<p>Can U.S. Aid Benefit Civilians?</p>
<p>On February 19, 1948, Ambassador Stuart stated that the aid plan for China "aims to benefit civilians." The committee reiterates that those responsible for implementing this plan must pay attention to ensuring that this is indeed achieved in rural areas and in a smaller number of urban centers. The purpose of the application of U.S. dollars in China is the responsibility that the plan implementers and the Chinese government should first pay attention to.</p>
<p>U.S. Commercial Interests in China</p>
<p>U.S. commerce in China is at a standstill. American commercial interests have complained of various discriminatory measures, which prevent them from enjoying equal commercial opportunities. If the Chinese government can remove the obstacles to outbound activities and guarantee that it will not adopt discriminatory treatment towards American commercial interests, it will greatly help encourage China's traditional free enterprise and attract foreign trade and investment. The committee believes that the Chinese government will find that taking positive action along these lines is beneficial in many ways.</p>
<p>Agreements with China</p>
<p>The committee intends to grant the Secretary of State broad authority to negotiate agreements with China, in consultation with the administrator of economic cooperation, stipulating that China must, to the extent possible, assure U.S. taxpayers that the money it pays will be used effectively to achieve the goals of this bill and the Chinese people. The committee, while believing that some details may need to be revised or added to accommodate the proposed plan, recognizes the agreement signed in Nanjing on October 27, 1947, pursuant to Public Law 84 of the 80th Congress. The contents of the agreement are reprinted in Appendix B.</p>

<h3 id="e73">Public Trial of the Social Affairs Bureau Smashing Case; Dancers Weep Incessantly in Special Court; Sixty-Nine Men and Women Interrogated; Tang Zongjie Accused of Being the Culprit; Court Hearing to Continue This Afternoon and Begin Debate <a href="#e73" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c73" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">73</a></h3>
<p>[Our report] The case of dance industry workers and dancers smashing the Social Affairs Bureau was publicly tried for the first time yesterday in the Special Criminal Court of Tilanqiao. At around 9:00 a.m., Judge Wang Zhennan, Judges Sun Tiling and Xu Naikun, and Court Clerk Xu Leshi took their seats. Thirty-seven defendants, including Tang Zongjie, who were in custody, were brought in, and thirty-two defendants, including Yu Zhiqin, who were released on bail, were summoned for interrogation. Reporters from various newspapers and the defendants' family members were allowed to enter and listen, after first signing their names and receiving audience passes. Armed police were heavily guarded. Because the courtroom was small and crowded, there was no space to sit. The defendants in custody were pale and emaciated, with disheveled hair, and staggered as they walked. Dancers Hong Xiaoping, Wang Min, and others covered their faces and sobbed upon entering the court, and did not stop crying until they left the court. The defendants released on bail, on the other hand, were energetic and lively, a world of difference compared to those in custody. More than ten defense lawyers, including Chen Tingrui and Zhou Yizhi, arrived in the morning, but only one lawyer appeared in court in the afternoon. The morning session lasted until 12:00 p.m., and the afternoon session lasted from 2:00 p.m. to around 4:00 p.m. The court ordered the hearing to continue at 2:00 p.m. this afternoon and to begin the debate.</p>
<p>At 9:15 a.m., Judge Wang first called the roll, and all sixty-nine defendants were present. After completing the roll call at 10:35 a.m., Judge Wang announced: "This court received a transfer order from the Shanghai Municipal Police Department on March 17 this year, stating that the case of Zhu Zui, Yu Zhiqin, and others smashing the Social Affairs Bureau violated Article 7 of the Regulations on Punishing Acts Endangering National Security during the Period of Suppressing Rebellion, and is being sent to this court for trial. Because it was sent by transfer order, it will be treated as a prosecution argument, and the trial will begin today."</p>
<h3 id="e74">Collective Petition Unanswered; Public Outrage Leads to Incident <a href="#e74" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c74" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">74</a></h3>
<p>The first to be interrogated was Tang Zongjie, the unemployed chairman of the city labor union. Tang was wearing a gray cloth long gown, with a face full of worry. The court interrogated Tang: "Did you lead the dance industry workers in smashing the Social Affairs Bureau? Did you accept orders from the Communist Party? Today I am giving you a chance. If you were instigated by the Communist Party, you can confess frankly, otherwise it will be unfavorable to you when the investigation comes out." Tang replied: "This time the dance industry suffered a crisis because the Social Affairs Bureau advanced the lottery date. At that time, the workers and dancers were all meeting at New Xianlin, about two thousand people. When they heard this news, they all had job anxiety after the dance industry, and in order to eat, they collectively petitioned the Social Affairs Bureau. Unexpectedly, after arriving at the Social Affairs Bureau, no one came out to meet them, which led to public outrage and an unfortunate incident. Therefore, this time smashing the Social Affairs Bureau was entirely due to a momentary emotional impulse, and there was absolutely no Communist infiltration involved. I am a member of the Three Principles of the People Youth League and will definitely not be utilized by the Communist Party."</p>
<h3 id="e75">Petitioning the Social Affairs Bureau Was a Joint Effort <a href="#e75" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c75" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">75</a></h3>
<p>This petition to the Social Affairs Bureau was orchestrated by the Joint Office of the Ballroom Industry, encompassing five groups: investors (Sun Hongyuan, etc.), employees (Tang Zongjie, etc.), dancers (Jin Meihong, etc.), managers (Wu Fugen, etc.), and musicians (He Hai, etc.). The petition was not solely the responsibility of the labor union. The rumors that dancers would be fined 3 million yuan for not petitioning and employees would be suspended for not participating are untrue, as the labor union has no such power. Hu Yunyuan, the standing director of the labor union, stated, "Obeying orders is important, but so is earning a living." Wang Min, dressed in a black cheongsam, sobbed during her testimony, saying, "There was a party flag at the scene, but I did not enter the Social Affairs Bureau office. The person in the beating photograph is not me. My hair is short, while this person's hair is long. I wore a long leather cheongsam during the petition, while this person wore a short jacket, and it's a back view, so it's insufficient evidence." Dancers Hong Xiaoping, Tan Pei'e, Feng Aina, Sun Huiling, Li Jun, Luo Ying, Yang Lili, and others also wept uncontrollably during their testimonies. Jin Zukun admitted to shouting slogans, but stated that his slogan was "Support the Constitution."</p>
<h3 id="e76">A Female Student's Rash Actions Provoke the Judge's Wrath <a href="#e76" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c76" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">76</a></h3>
<p>Among the 69 defendants, the only non-ballroom worker was Jin Ying, a student from Yunzhong Girls' High School, wearing a blue cotton cheongsam, aged 17. She testified, "A former classmate, Chen Juping, who is now a dancer, invited me to see a movie at the Majestic Theatre. Because we couldn't buy tickets, Chen asked me to go to the New Celestial Forest to take a look. At that time, the ballroom workers were about to leave for the petition, and they pulled me onto a truck. After arriving at the Social Affairs Bureau, Chen told me to shout 'Show courage!' I followed along and was arrested by the police." Judge Wang was enraged and reprimanded her, "If this case involved only ballroom workers, people wouldn't suspect political motives. Now, because you alone are mixed in, people suspect that students are inciting the dance craze and that there is a political background. You are only 17 and have already harmed so many people. How many people will you harm when you are 37!" Jin Ying burst into tears, and the audience was in an uproar.</p>
<h3 id="e77">Everyone Agrees: No One Took Action <a href="#e77" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c77" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">77</a></h3>
<p>The court convened in the afternoon to question the defendants who had been released on bail, asking the usual questions: "Did you participate in the petition? Did you take action to vandalize the Social Affairs Bureau?" The defendants all answered, "I went, but I didn't take action. I stood in the back. I didn't see anyone taking action." However, at the very end, Zhang Rongshou and Ma Hongkui, big shots from the Far East, presented a certificate proving that they were informants for the Central Statistics Bureau. They testified that they went to the Social Affairs Bureau not to petition, but to do work. They stated with conviction, "There is absolutely no communist activity within."</p>
<p>Finally, Judge Wang showed Tang Zongjie a meeting record, in which a resolution "Collectively petition the Social Affairs Bureau" was proposed by Tang. Judge Wang said sternly, "This vandalism incident at the Social Affairs Bureau started with the person who proposed the petition. Because of the petition, the communists were able to take the opportunity to act. Therefore, you are the main culprit and cannot escape responsibility." Upon hearing this, Tang was thunderstruck and tearfully said, "Zhu proposed this in the meeting. This record is a forgery, an attempt to frame me. Please investigate carefully, Your Honor." At this point, the court announced that arguments would begin tomorrow afternoon (referring to the 29th), those in custody would remain in custody, and those released on bail would remain on their original bail.</p>
<h3 id="e78">Tang Zongjie Tried Hard to Stop the Disturbance; Reporters at the Scene Willing to Testify <a href="#e78" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c78" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">78</a></h3>
<p>When the court adjourned, reporters from various newspapers requested Judge Wang to allow them to speak with the defendant Tang Zongjie for ten minutes. Judge Wang permitted it. According to Tang's conversation with reporters: "At the Social Affairs Bureau, I strongly urged the employees not to act rashly. I spoke until my voice was hoarse. Reporters at the scene must have seen this. Unexpectedly, the investors later pushed all the responsibility onto the labor union, and the police investigation resulted in no investor defendants, which is very unfair. Furthermore, the forged records have caused me to suffer an unwarranted injustice. I deeply hope that the media will uphold justice." At that time, many reporters who were at the scene when the Social Affairs Bureau incident occurred witnessed Tang preventing the crowd from rioting and indicated that they were willing to testify if necessary.</p>

<p>[Reported by this newspaper] Mayor Wu, at the invitation of the city's magazine industry, delivered a speech at the Fudan Alumni Association on Beijing Road last night at 7 p.m. Mayor Wu began by expressing humility, saying that he had always been afraid of speaking to the cultural community, fearing that he would be ridiculed. He then said that the sales of Chinese magazines are currently dismal, not even as good as the sales of American magazines in China. He mentioned that to study the success of foreign magazines, there are inherent external environmental factors, such as the high level of knowledge of the masses and the development of air transport.</p>
<p>Three Internal Factors</p>
<p>In addition, I believe that there are three internal factors: (1) Accuracy: I remember that there is an American magazine called "Fortune" that specifically stated that everything published in the magazine is factual and that readers who can catch errors will be rewarded with five dollars, etc., and the result was very successful. (2) Catering to Social Psychology: Western magazines have clear target audiences and content aimed at a specific class, so each magazine has its fixed readers. (3) A Spirit of Seeking Progress in Stability: When Western magazines are launched, they often have a firm grasp and a long-term vision. In the first few issues, they do not seek merit, but seek no fault. When readers gain confidence, they gradually develop. This kind of spirit seems to be lacking in the Chinese magazine industry. The current universal phenomenon in the magazine industry is that the first issue is the best, and each issue afterwards is not as good as the previous one, and being overdue is even more commonplace. This phenomenon is enough to affect magazine sales. If it can be improved, I deeply believe that the future of the Chinese magazine industry will be unlimited. As the saying goes: only if you endure hardship can you achieve success. I congratulate my colleagues in the magazine industry for working hard for the advancement of culture.</p>
<p>Mayor Wu finally reported that his parents came to Shanghai from Hankou yesterday, and he was eager to go home to reunite with them, hoping that the attendees could understand his early departure with the heart of a son.</p>

<p>[Reported by this newspaper] Mao Shengdong, Chairman of the Jiangsu and Zhejiang Fishermen's Association, was previously secretly reported to the court by Zhong Ruiqi and three others for: (1) Mao used the name of the Shengsi Islands Fisheries Cooperative to obtain a re-export certificate from the Ministry of Food, but in fact, the cooperative was not registered with the competent authority and was not established.

Most of the grain purchased by the association was purchased and transported locally in Shanghai, which is illegal. (3) The association illegally collected donations for rice exports, 12,000 yuan per family, under the guise of sponsorship and entertainment expenses. The above accusations were investigated and confirmed by Peng Yongcheng, leader of the public grain supervision team of the Ministry of Food.

<p>[Reported by this newspaper] The Shanghai Soldiers' Service Association held its ninth standing committee meeting yesterday afternoon. Chairman Pan Gongzhan delivered a speech, reporting the following points: (1) The first batch of soldier settlement fees started to be issued on the 20th of this month. As of the 27th, a total of 481 soldiers have been paid, each receiving 10 shi of medium-cooked rice, which is converted and paid according to the household rice allocation price in May, 3.5 million yuan per shi, for a total expenditure of 16.835 billion yuan. (2) Regarding the solution to the problem of issuing soldier settlement fees before they are collected, the Civil Affairs Bureau previously signed off on the Mayor's approval to first allocate 100 billion yuan from the garrison brigade's expenses to cover the costs, which will be reimbursed when the settlement fees are collected. After successive negotiations, a contract to overdraft 100 billion yuan from the City Bank was signed on the 17th of this month, and it has already started to be used. (3) The City Bank previously sent a letter to the Soldiers' Service Association regarding the case of interest and acceptance fees of 1.719 billion yuan for the previous loan of 105 billion yuan from seven banks and bureaus, and the association has sent a letter to the City Bank, which agreed to waive the fees as a preferential treatment. (4) The previous letter to the municipal government to transfer the negotiations with the City Bank to borrow 15 billion yuan to cover the costs of collecting soldier settlement fees was previously approved by the municipal government, stating that the City Bank was unable to raise the funds. Now, 100 billion yuan from the garrison brigade's expenses has been allocated to cover the costs. (5) The Physical Examination Committee has been dispatched by 15 major hospitals in the city since the 17th of this month to conduct physical examinations at the new recruit conscription center on a rotating basis, and the Supervision Committee has also sent personnel to be stationed at the center to carry out supervision tasks. (6) The task of supervising the collection of soldier settlement fees in various districts has been dispatched since the 17th of this month by two cadres from each of the association and the Civil Affairs Bureau to carry out supervision. Later, discussions began, and the following key cases were decided: (1) After the new soldiers are sent from the new recruit conscription center to the regimental management district new soldier brigade, regardless of how long it takes to transfer them (referring to the transfer of new soldier training institutions), the second batch of soldier settlement fees will still be converted and paid according to the June allocation price of rice. (2) The new soldiers' comfort items such as toothbrushes, towels, toothpaste, soap, shoes, socks, and rice bowls are the responsibility of the Soldiers' Service Association to prepare.</p>

<p>The names of the sixty-nine defendants were called, and they were all asked "What's your name, how old are you, where are you from, what do you do, where do you live?" It took a full hour and thirty-five minutes.</p>
<p>A reporter once counted that there were a total of 167 people in the special criminal court, including judges, male and female lawyers, newspaper reporters, security police, bailiffs, audience members, and defendants. There was no room to stand.</p>
<p>Hong Xiaoping started the crying trend. Tears streamed down her face as soon as she entered the door. After the court hearing, she saw her sister sitting in the audience. After the two looked at each other for a moment, they cried even more uncontrollably.</p>
<p>Yang Lili from "Far East" burst into tears at the window as soon as she left the defendant's column. Wang Min from "Dahu" also grieved for her life and wiped away her tears frequently. A man in a long gown in the audience had red eyes at this time, but did not shed tears. It is said that he is Wang Min's long-suffering husband.</p>
<p>The judge said to Tang Zongjie, "If you didn't petition, you wouldn't be taken advantage of by the communists, and you wouldn't vandalize the Social Affairs Bureau, so the person who proposed the petition is the chief culprit." After saying this, he showed Tang the association's record book and pointed at Tang, saying, "You are the chief culprit!" The whole room was startled.</p>
<p>The words "Proposed by Tang Zongjie" written in the record book were obviously added later. Tang's tears flowed non-stop, and he shouted urgently, "Please investigate, Your Honor. I have eight family members, and my old mother is about to die of illness. I really can't bear this charge."</p>
<p>Tang Zongjie said that he is a member of the Kuomintang and has a party card. He is also a member of the Youth Corps and holds the position of squadron leader, requesting an investigation.</p>
<p>Zhu Fei, the boss of "Saint Taile," testified that he originally intended to go on a hunger strike if the petition was unsuccessful, but who knew that a conflict would break out temporarily. There was no political purpose. After the court session in the afternoon, Zhu Fei raised his right hand for five minutes, requesting to speak, but his wish was not fulfilled.</p>
<p>Li Meiping, a singer from "Dahu," previously stated that she was 26 years old, but today she said she was 25 years old. After being questioned by the judge, she said, "It's just 25 or 26, there's no real reason."</p>
<p>Shi Meifang from "Huadu" was praised by the judge for being "very honest" because she said that she wanted to hit people when she went to the Social Affairs Bureau, but couldn't squeeze in.</p>
<p>All the defendants said in unison that they went to the Social Affairs Bureau, but did not take action. After the judge asked, he jokingly answered the testimony on their behalf: "You went, but you didn't hit anyone, right?" The defendants nodded, causing laughter in the court. The judge also said, "You all say that you didn't hit anyone, either because you arrived late or you were in the back. Then who hit them? The back was full of people, where did the people in the front go?" This also caused a burst of laughter.</p>
<p>When the court session ended, the audience and the defendants released on bail exited the courtroom. The defendants in custody, who were in a miserable state, were touched by the scene, and cries suddenly arose. Some waved to the group of reporters and appealed for help, while others cried out piteously for the old man to help them, which was heartbreaking.</p>

<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Mr. Xu Yiqin of this city (see picture) recently wrote to the National Shanghai Medical College, stating that he is willing to provide his body for teaching and experimental purposes after his death. He also pre-drafted a will on the back of a football match ticket in his wallet, stating, "No matter when or where I die, please notify Shanghai Medical College to collect my body for dissection." His spirit of breaking superstitions is worthy of being a pioneer in the social atmosphere. The reporter paid a special visit to Mr. Xu last night. According to him, he is currently an inspector at the Garden Management Office of the Municipal Bureau of Public Works. He is 35 years old, a native of Shanghai, and there is no special reason or strange idea for this move. It is because he recently read in the newspaper that Shanghai Medical College lacks dissection teaching materials. He believes that the human body is fundamentally composed of cells, so it does not matter how the body is disposed of after death. Moreover, science is now developed, and the old concepts of the past should be broken. Therefore, he immediately wrote to the medical college.</p>
<p>Mr. Xu graduated from the Department of Agronomy of Jinling University this year. During the War of Resistance, he participated in the army and studied various agricultural products to improve their manufacturing, such as manufacturing oatmeal and setting up many factories in Guiyang, refining dried fruits, and using coffee bottles to modify the bottle caps into pressure regulating plugs to make Sichuan pickles. When he graduated, he wrote a thesis entitled "Military Dehydrated Vegetables." He also said that although he received a university education and studied science, he is ashamed of having no achievements. Now he is willing to provide his body for teaching after his death, which is considered to be some contribution to the society and the country. He also said that this matter is not worthy of attention and humbly asked not to publish his name to avoid misunderstandings from the outside world.</p>
<p>When the reporter visited yesterday, Mr. Xu was out. His wife, who currently works at the Customs, suddenly became extremely anxious and her hands and voice trembled when she heard about this. She did not know that Mr. Xu had sent such a letter to the medical college beforehand, and she had not seen Xu return since noon yesterday, so she suspected an accident and hurriedly took her four-year-old son out to borrow a phone to inquire everywhere. After about an hour, she returned home disappointed without finding any trace, but at this time Xu had returned home. After explaining, Mr. Xu also expressed his apologies for not telling his wife beforehand.</p>
<h3 id="e105">Storm over the "National Exhibition" at St. John's University: Students to Host Press Conference Today; Whether Alumni Reunion will be Held Becomes a Question <a href="#e105" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c105" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">105</a></h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The "National Exhibition" initiated by the Student Union of St. John's University, with opposition to the "U.S. Support for Japan Issue" as its focus, continued to be exhibited on campus yesterday, but it has been moved from the recreation room to the lawn. The exhibits are mostly woodcut cartoons, photos, etc. Many Chinese and foreign reporters went to visit yesterday. The most eye-catching among them was the photo of Zhu De, the so-called "Chinese Anti-Japanese Hero."</p>
<p>The beginning of this exhibition was actually launched at the May 20th Memorial Meeting, and was later decided at the "Symposium on the U.S. Support for Japan Issue." At that time, Tu Yuqing, President of St. John's University, Lin Muguang, Professor of the Department of Economics, and Pan Shizi, Acting Dean of Student Affairs, personally attended and participated, and obtained the permission of the President. However, recently, due to the President's measures to stop the exhibition from continuing, the students raised questions and published a long announcement of about a thousand words, expressing dissatisfaction with the school. At the same time, they also demanded that the school disclose the details of the visit of personnel from the U.S. Embassy and Consulate to the President and asked President Tu to express his position.</p>
<p>In addition, another reason for this incident was the passionate speech of Chen Renbing, the school's professor of the Three People's Principles, which had a great impact. At the lecture, Chen called for opposition to the revival of fascism at home and abroad, and to follow the example of American leftist leader Henry Wallace. At the same time, he incited the students to unite under the banner of the Student Union, which was banned by the government authorities!</p>
<p>After the inside story of this incident was revealed by Chinese and foreign newspapers in recent days, the students' emotions have been very tense. A press conference is scheduled to be held on campus this afternoon to report on the process of this matter. Whether the annual alumni reunion, which was originally scheduled to be held this afternoon, can be held as usual without being affected is still a question.</p>
<p>In addition, the "May 30th Memorial Meeting" (initiated by four student associations in the school) originally scheduled to be held yesterday was postponed to the day after tomorrow due to insufficient preparation.</p>

<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] A group of students from the Shanghai Academy of Fine Arts went to Jiaotong University on the 22nd of this month to participate in the so-called "May 20th Anniversary Evening Party." With the theme of "Opposing U.S. Support for Japan," they attempted to expand the propaganda to overthrow the government. After being denounced by most of the students in the school, a mutual fight broke out yesterday. The Songshan Police Branch sent personnel to suppress the incident, and the situation did not escalate. According to reports, the National Salvation and Nation-Building Association, formed by student Xie of the school, posted a notice the day before yesterday, pointing out that the few students who participated in the Jiaotong University evening party were being used by traitors, and claiming that the school's student union and student federation were illegal organizations that should be dissolved. This caused dissatisfaction among the student union cadres. Yesterday afternoon, when Xie and five other students returned to school for dinner, they gathered many people, stepped forward to question and insult them, which led to a mutual fight. Later, after the persuasion of Song, the Dean of Academic Affairs of the school, and the dispatch of personnel from the Songshan Police Branch to the school to suppress the incident, the dispute subsided.</p>

<p>The rice market continued to soar, mainly due to the price increase in Wuxi. The price in the Nangang production area also rose. Coupled with the daily decrease in arrivals, the owners were unwilling to sell at low prices. Due to the price limit in the market, transactions were still suspended. Supply rice continued to be released, and the amount in the two markets was still 6,000 shi, and the price remained unchanged. The off-market price of white round-grain rice reached 7 million, but the market was slightly weak afterwards. Thin rice and indica rice were 6.9 million each, an increase of 300,000 to 400,000 compared to the previous day.

Yesterday, a total of 2,483 shi of passenger and cargo rice were registered.</p>

The early opening was the firmest. Lao Che and Bingchuan flour opened at 2.22 million each, and then some sold at high prices. Retail investors did not dare to buy more.

At the opening, the owners still wanted to take advantage of the rise in rice prices to continue to quote higher prices, but due to the lack of confidence in high prices, the price increase was weak. Broad beans closed at 3.4 million, slightly lower than the previous day by 50,000. Northern corn was not popular, and the market was stable. Selected green mung beans were stable. Shaoxing new green rice debuted yesterday at a price of 2.95 million. Red sorghum fell by 50,000 to 100,000, sesame weakened by 100,000, and raw peanuts fell sharply by 1 million due to the heavy selling the previous day.</p>
<p>Edible oil showed a slight decline. Raw oil rose sharply the previous day, and fell sharply yesterday. Although there were not many sales, the willingness to buy was also weak, resulting in quiet transactions. Qingdao Jiton raw oil opened at 17.4 million, a decrease of 600,000. Although soybean oil fell slightly, it was only called flat. The sales of soybean oil were more active in this street. Dayou soybean oil initially opened at 15 million, and then opened at 15.1 million. The lowest Changde soybean oil was 14.6 million. Vegetable oil factories offered more new rapeseed, so the sales were not stingy, and the price fell by 300,000 to 400,000. Small car sesame oil fell by 300,000. Initially, there was a willingness to buy soybean cake, and 30,000 to 40,000 were traded. In the end, because there were not many buyers, it returned to the original price of the previous day.</p>

<h3 id="e114">Manufacturers Request Input of Raw Materials Must Have Solid Sales Assurance <a href="#e114" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c114" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">114</a></h3>
<p>The China Cotton Textile Industry Production and Sales Joint Venture Company was recently subjected to compensation after transporting cotton textiles to Hong Kong for export, and had presented a request for relief from the Export Control Committee. It is reported that the spokesperson of the Export Promotion Department of the Export Control Committee said that the important purposes of the Export Promotion Department's measures for the rotation of raw materials for export products are three: (1) To promote the export of domestic products, (2) To increase the state treasury's foreign exchange income, (3) To assist manufacturers in obtaining raw materials and reducing costs. Since the handling of this matter, many manufacturers and exporters have been eager to apply for the import of raw materials. So far, they are generally satisfied. After applying this method, manufacturers can import a part of the raw materials to reduce their export costs, which is very beneficial to promoting the export of manufactured products. However, the department recently learned that some exporters applied rashly in the hope of obtaining imported raw materials. The export goods have no buyers who have concluded a deal, and there is no concrete plan for actual sales that is guaranteed. In fact, they are only transferring goods from Shanghai to Hong Kong, waiting for an opportunity to seek actual sales. Therefore, once unfavorable changes occur in the Hong Kong market, they will inevitably be compensated. Moreover, it does not fully comply with the government's original purpose of promoting exports. For example, although the Export Promotion Department approved the China Cotton Textile Industry Production and Sales Joint Venture Company to import raw materials with 40% of the foreign exchange earned from the export of its cotton textiles, the company suffered losses because the market price of cotton textiles fell sharply when the company transported the cotton textiles to Hong Kong, which happened to be at a time when there were rapid changes in the Hong Kong market. The Export Promotion Department expressed deep regret for this, but the reason why the company was compensated was because the company did not understand commercial practices and took on too much risk. The spokesperson of the Export Promotion Department said that he hopes that when manufacturers and exporters apply for the input of raw materials using the above-mentioned method, the exported manufactured products must have been concluded and there is a solid assurance of sales, so as to avoid unexpected compensation.</p>

<p>[Our Report] The Sixth District Cotton Textile Industry Association will hold a meeting within days to exchange views on the allocation of American aid cotton. A total of 300,000 bales of American cotton are currently being shipped from the United States to China in batches. How to allocate them in the future has already attracted the attention of yarn factories. The majority believe that allocation should be proportional to the number of spindles, so that the production of each yarn factory can develop to the highest level, or exchange cotton for yarn, with each calculated according to market prices. It is also reported that the first batch of 50,000 bales of American aid cotton is expected to arrive within the next week, and the supply of raw cotton is expected to improve. However, the high production cost of cotton yarn is a hidden worry for the future of the textile industry.</p>

<p>The third Mayoral Cup Football Tournament has entered its final stage. Donghua has already defeated Tede, thus securing the right to compete in the final. Qingbaiqing and Railway will face off in a rematch at Yiyuan this afternoon at 4:00 PM. The winner will compete with Donghua for the throne. Qingbaiqing fully demonstrated its power in the game against Qunli last week, and on Monday, a surprise attack against the British Navy resulted in a 3-2 come-from-behind victory, proving its strong momentum and smooth ball possession. Railway has many outstanding newcomers, who are not only young and strong but also well-coordinated, and their individual skills are also excellent. In terms of skill, they are comparable to Qingbai. When the two heroes meet, a fierce battle is inevitable. However, Liao Xiong and Cao Liming are both suffering from minor illnesses, and whether they will be able to play at the time may become a problem. If so, Railway will inevitably be slightly affected. Tickets today are still sold at 100,000 yuan and 60,000 yuan.</p>

<p>[Our Report from Shenyang, 28th] Middle and high school students from the Northeast are flocking to the Pass. In the past two months, over 730 people have arrived in Peiping (Beiping) on foot or by air. Those in charge have found that some of them are wealthy, well-dressed, and living comfortably, while others are poor and living in small dwellings, eating cornbread. It is a repeat of the old tune of refugees after the September 18th Incident! Northeast Provisional University and Provisional Middle School are being actively prepared by Fang Yongzheng and Chen Kefu. They have found a suitable school site in Northern Middle School. The Ministry of Education has allocated 5 billion legal tender, and classes are scheduled to begin on June 1st.

A special temporary relief fund of 300 million has been allocated, and the Ministry of Education has remitted 200 million in relief funds, for a total of 500 million national currency. However, after the registration deadline, it was discovered that about 1,000 people were students from the Northeast who were already studying in Peiping and had also mixed into the registration. Those in charge are strictly reviewing documents, and those who impersonate are being disqualified from receiving relief funds. Some students from Northeast University have voluntarily left for the Pass. The first batch of over 300 people is currently negotiating charter flight procedures. Student representatives from Panyang Medical College went to Beijing to petition, hoping to relocate the school to Taiwan, but there has been no response. Students from Private Chung Cheng University are quickly leaving. Students from National Changbai Normal College are also leaving Panyang one after another. Most students from various schools are leaving for the south after graduating recently.</p>

<h3 id="e139">On "Yun Ying" <a href="#e139" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c139" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">139</a></h3>
<p>— Tang Lan</p>
<p>Scholars have always believed that there were two types of "Yun Ying" (Rhyme Treasury) during the Tianbao era: one was the "Tianbao Yun Ying" and the other was the "Chen Tingjian Yun Ying." This error originated with Dai Zhen. The postscript to Han Shi's phonetic examination paper on the yuan rhyme states:</p>
<p>The notes from the Jixian Academy at the end of the Tianbao era state that the emperor, considering that ancient rhyme usage was not very distinct and Lu Fayan's "Qie Yun" failed to rectify this, ordered a revision and compilation of the "Yun Ying," maintaining its five-volume structure. The old rhyme had 439 categories, while 151 new categories were added, resulting in 580 rhyme categories with 19,177 characters, analyzed with great detail. However, the "Southern New Records" states that Chen Tingjian compiled a ten-volume "Yun Ying" during the Tianbao era. Thus, could the 439 categories mentioned in the notes refer to Tingjian's work? And could the maintained five-volume structure be based on Lu Fayan's format?</p>
<p>Wang Guowei's "Guan Tang Collected Works," Volume 8, contains the "Examination of Tianbao Yun Ying, Chen Tingjian Yun Ying, Zhang Zhi's Examination of Sound, and Wu Xuanzhi's Rhyme Classification":</p>
<p>The "Jade Sea" Volume 45 quotes Wei Shu's Jixian Academy notes, stating, "At the end of the Tianbao era,...resulting in 580 categories, analyzed with great detail," and so on. The old rhyme of 439 categories is of unclear reference. The "Southern New Records" states that Chen Youyuan Tingjian compiled a ten-volume "Yun Ying" at the end of the Tianbao era. Dong Yuan suspects that the old rhyme refers to Tingjian's work, as both books are named "Yun Ying." The imperial compilation of the Tianbao era was likely an expansion of Tingjian's work, which is plausible.</p>
<p>However, according to the preface written by Jing Shen in the "Comprehensive Meaning of All Sutra Sounds" by Seng Lin, the author of "Yun Ying" is "Yuan Tingjian." Therefore, Mr. Wang states in that article:</p>
<p>The author of "Yun Ying" is Yuan Tingjian in the preface of "Comprehensive Meaning of All Sutra Sounds," and Chen Youyuan Tingjian in the "Southern New Records." It is unknown which is correct, and neither person can be verified.</p>
<p>When I was reading that article, I was also reading "Taiping Guangji," and in Volume 460, I discovered that the author of "Yun Ying" was Chen Wang Youyuan Tingjian. I wrote a letter to inform Mr. Wang, and Mr. Wang wrote the following note on the margin of his "Guan Tang Collected Works":</p>
<p>Jiaxing's Tang Youlan believes it should be Chen Wang Youyuan Tingjian, as seen in the bird category of "Taiping Guangji." (See the table of marginal notes on "Guan Tang Collected Works" by Yao Mingda in the special issue dedicated to Mr. Wang Jing'an in the "Journal of Sinology.")</p>
<p>However, the person who compiled Wang Zhongque's posthumous works deleted the phrase "it is unknown which is correct" from Mr. Wang's original sentence, "Neither person can be verified," and forcefully inserted the phrase "The bird category of 'Taiping Guangji' lists Chen Wang Youyuan Tingjian," seemingly intending to revise Mr. Wang's article to perfection, but unknowingly committed a major error.</p>
<p>Because Mr. Wang's knowledge of "Yun Ying" came from Dai Dongyuan, he consulted the Jixian Academy notes and "Southern New Records" quoted in "Jade Sea." Dai Dongyuan quoted "Southern New Records" stating "Chen Tingjian compiled a ten-volume 'Yun Ying'," while Mr. Wang quoted "Chen Youyuan Tingjian compiled a ten-volume 'Yun Ying'," indicating that he had consulted the original text. However, we do not know which version he consulted, because both versions of the "Southern New Records" in my possession, from the "Xuejin Taoyuan" and "Yueyatang Congshu" series, clearly state:</p>
<p>During the Tianbao era, Hanlin Academician Chen Wang Youyuan Tingjian compiled a ten-volume "Yun Ying," which was not implemented before the Western Capital fell to the barbarians. Tingjian died.</p>
<p>This is exactly the same as "Taiping Guangji." Mr. Wang's source lacks the word "Wang." Additionally, since Dai Dongyuan said "Chen Tingjian," he likely, due to a preconceived notion, read the two characters "Youyuan" together, becoming "Chen Youyuan," who was also called "Chen Tingjian." Thus, in the title of this article, he still calls it "Chen Tingjian Yun Ying," while in the article he says "Yuan Tingjian" or "Chen Youyuan Tingjian," not knowing which is correct, and that neither person can be verified. It seems as if Mr. Wang already knew it was "Chen Wang Youyuan Tingjian," he definitely wouldn't be ignorant of the official title "Chen Wang." (Actually, when he wrote my statement in the margin, he already knew that "Yuan Tingjian" was correct.) This kind of casually altering other people's articles is an unforgivable crime.</p>
<p>In fact, the "Southern New Records" is simply a collection of anecdotes. This entry should be a record excerpted from Niu Su's "Chronicle of Events." Lu Xinyuan once collected Niu's book, but it is no longer seen. "Taiping Yulan" Volume 460, in the entry for Yuan Tingjian, states:</p>
<p>Chen Wang Youyuan Tingjian, a Hanlin Academician of the Tang Dynasty, formerly dismissed from the post of Military Advisor of a remote prefecture, lived in the mountains on the border of the prefecture and studied.... Consequently, Tingjian understood phonology and excelled in writing, unmatched at the time. He was versed in yin-yang arts and numerology. While at the Hanlin Academy, he compiled a ten-volume "Yun Ying," which was not implemented before the Western Capital fell to the barbarians, and Tingjian also died. This passage quotes the "Chronicle of Events," and apart from a few different words, it is entirely the same as the "Southern New Records," which can serve as proof.</p>
<p>Although Niu Su's portrayal of Yuan Tingjian's understanding of phonology and writing, granted by the Crow King, is mythical, he provides a more detailed account of Yuan Tingjian's life. We can learn that he first served as the Military Advisor of Suizhou, and later became a Hanlin Academician named Chen Wang You. (Chen Wang was Chen Wang Gui, the son of Emperor Xuanzong). While at the Hanlin Academy, he compiled "Yun Ying," which was not implemented before the Western Capital fell to the barbarians. This was in the first year of the Zhide era (756 AD), and Tingjian also died at that time.</p>
<p>Let's return to Wei Shu's Jixian Academy notes, which state, "At the end of the Tianbao era, the emperor, considering that ancient rhyme usage was not very distinct and Lu Fayan's 'Qie Yun' failed to rectify this, ordered a revision and compilation of the 'Yun Ying,' maintaining its five-volume structure," as well as the "Tang Huiyao": "In the fourth month of the fourteenth year of Tianbao, the imperial 'Yun Ying' in five volumes was issued, and the Jixian Academy was ordered to transcribe it for use." Also, the "New Tang History, Treatise on Literature and Arts" notes on Emperor Xuanzong's "Yun Ying" in five volumes: "Compiled in the fourteenth year of Tianbao, the Jixian Academy was ordered to transcribe it and send it to the inspection commissioners in various regions." These accounts are entirely consistent with the era of Yuan Tingjian's "Yun Ying." Yuan Tingjian was a Hanlin Academician at that time, and also well-versed in phonology. Who else but him would be responsible for Emperor Xuanzong's revision and compilation of "Yun Ying"? According to the "New Tang History," Emperor Xuanzong's "Yun Ying" was compiled in the fourteenth year of Tianbao, and the Jixian Academy was ordered to transcribe it and send it to the inspection commissioners in various regions. In the fourteenth year of Tianbao, An Lushan had already captured the Eastern Capital, and the following year, the Western Capital was captured. Therefore, Niu's "Chronicle of Events" states "not implemented." This is clear evidence that Yuan Tingjian's "Yun Ying" is the same as Emperor Xuanzong's "Yun Ying" or the "Tianbao Yun Ying." If Yuan Tingjian's "Yun Ying" was merely a private work intended to compete with the emperor, it would definitely not be referred to as "implemented." As for the Jixian Academy notes, "Tang Huiyao," and "Tang History" all mentioning five volumes, while Niu's "Chronicle of Events" says ten volumes, this is simply because Niu divided each volume into two, which is not unusual.</p>
<p>Since Emperor Xuanzong's "Yun Ying" and Yuan Tingjian's "Yun Ying" are the same book, the claims by Dai Dongyuan and Wang Jing'an that the old rhyme of 439 categories refers to Tingjian's version are obviously incorrect. In my postscript to Wang Renxu's "Qie Yun," I pointed out that the so-called old rhyme still refers to Lu Fayan's "Qie Yun," but in terms of rhyme categories, not rhyme headings. (Lu's book only has 193 rhyme categories.) The word "rhyme" is equivalent to the word "section" in "For Qi Yi Shi, divided into four sections."</p>
<p>Mr. Huang Cuibo knew that the "Chen" in Chen Tingjian should be "Yuan" (although he did not check the "Southern New Records"), and also knew that "Tingjian's book was also completed in the Tianbao era, so how could it be considered old?" However, he still believed that the "Tianbao Yun Ying" and Yuan Tingjian's "Yun Ying" were two separate books. Because he was compiling the "Examination of Reverses in Seng Lin's Comprehensive Meaning of All Sutra Sounds," the result of his connecting the reverses was that the number of rhyme headings was even fewer than in "Qie Yun." Therefore, he said:</p>
<p>Thus, the method of analyzing the more than five hundred sections of the Tianbao "Yun Ying" is vastly different from Tingjian's "Yun Ying," and the two books are not related.</p>
<p>Here, we must ask whether this method of connecting reverses is trustworthy. We only need to open his table of reverses and tones to see that the first character, "ba," has a total of eight reverse spellings: jiu yi, jiu yi, ji yi, ji yi, ji yi, ju yi, ji yi, and jing qi. This indicates that when Huilin wrote the book, he did not rely on a single rhyme book for pronunciation, but rather copied them down randomly. Jing Shen's preface states:</p>
<p>In ancient times, reverses often used labials for double sounds, starting with Fu Qian, with no fixed standard. Wu sounds and Qin sounds were indistinguishable, and clear rhymes and muddy rhymes were difficult to discern. The use of wu and xian as double sounds, and qi and zhi as repeated rhymes, and the like, were not adopted. Recently, there have been Yuan Tingjian's "Yun Ying" and Zhang Zhi's "Examination of Sound Qie Yun." The current sounds are based on these.</p>
<p>He clearly stated that he based his work on these two books, but Mr. Huang insisted on saying that he relied solely on Tingjian's "Yun Ying," which is difficult to believe.</p>
<p>However, even within these chaotic materials, we can see why "Ling Ying" added more than one hundred and fifty categories compared to Lu Fayan. Jing Shen said, "The use of qi and zhi as repeated rhymes" refers to Lu Fayan's "qu zhi fan," where qi is in the fourth division and zhi is in the third division. This is one point where Yuan Tingjian, Zhang Zhi, and others were more precise than Lu Fayan in dividing rhyme categories. Labial sounds originally had independent rhyme categories in "Qie Yun," but not very consistently. In Huilin's book, they became independent. Guttural, dental, tongue, and sibilant sounds also occasionally had independent categories in "Qie Yun," and this tendency became even more pronounced in the reverses in Huilin's book. Therefore, the increase of "Yun Ying" to 580 categories is the result of using more precise upper and lower characters in the reverses than Lu Fayan. Since the system of reverses used by Huilin was not pure, and the pronunciations could not include every small initial consonant, it is impossible to find a complete and precise "Yun Ying" system from this pile of materials. Moreover, from Dai Dongyuan to Mr. Huang, they all considered the 580 rhymes to be the distinction between "dong" and "dong," and did not realize that it was the distinction between "hong" and "zhong." Therefore, they could never figure out how so many rhymes came about.</p>
<p>Now, we can conclude that "Emperor Xuanzong's Yun Ying" is the same as "Yuan Tingjian's Yun Ying." Due to the An Lushan Rebellion, it did not become popular, and only Huilin adopted it due to the Qin sound system. Later, it was lost.</p>
<h3 id="e140">On the "Jian'an" Designation <a href="#e140" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c140" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">140</a></h3>
<p>— Wang Liqi</p>
<p>The name "Jian'an" of the Wei dynasty was commonly used by people of the Six Dynasties, Tang, and Song periods. The preface to Xiahou Xiaoruo's eulogy for the portrait of Dongfang Shuo in "Wen Xuan" states:</p>
<p>The Grand Master's name was Shuo, courtesy name Manqian, a native of Anci in Pingyuan. During the Jian'an period of the Wei dynasty, Anci was divided to establish the Lelang Commandery, so he was also a native of that commandery.</p>
<p>The "So Yin" commentary on the "Records of Xiao Xiangguo" states:</p>
<p>The "Gazetteer of the Taikang Era" states, "During the Jian'an period of Emperor Wu of Wei, the Nanyang region was divided to establish the Nanxiang Commandery. Emperor Wu of Jin later renamed it Shanyang Commandery." The "Yiwen Leiju" Volume 55, the preface to the collected works of Zhou Yu of the Zhao Kingdom states:</p>
<p>Since the end of the Jian'an period of the Wei dynasty and the Taikang era of the Jin dynasty, there have been three major changes in the style of calligraphy. Everyone claims to hold the pearl of the sacred serpent and embrace the jade of Mount Jing. Yan Shigu's commentary on the "Preface" of the "Book of Han" and the "Examination of Names, Titles, and Hometowns of Various Families in the Book of Han" states:</p>
<p>Deng Zhan, a native of Nanyang, served as General Fenwei during the Jian'an period of the Wei dynasty, facing Gao Le, Marquis of Xiang.</p>
<p>Wen Ying, courtesy name Shuliang, a native of Nanyang, served as an attendant to the Jing Province at the end of the Later Han dynasty. During the Jian'an period of the Wei dynasty, he served as the Deputy Magistrate of Ganling. The "New Tang History, Biography of Song Zhiwen" states:</p>
<p>After the Jian'an period of the Wei dynasty, and continuing through the Jiangzuo, poetic rules changed repeatedly. By the time of Shen Yue and Yu Xin, they subtly adhered to clear rhymes and precise antitheses. By the time of Zhiwen and Quanqi, they added more beauty and avoided tonal flaws. The phrases and chapters were standardized like brocade interwoven, and scholars followed them, calling them Shen Song, with the saying, "Su and Li in the front, Shen and Song shoulder to shoulder," referring to Su Wu and Li Ling. Accumulation of incorrect habits, this is one example. However, there are also those who doubt it. Li Shan's commentary on the preface to Dongfang Shuo's eulogy for the portrait in "Wen Xuan" states:</p>
<p>The Later Han Dynasty's "Book of Han" states that Emperor Xian changed the third year of Xingping to the first year of Jian'an. The current text says Wei, which is suspected to be an error.</p>
<p>He Yimen's "Reading Notes" states:</p>
<p>Jian'an was still a year of the Han dynasty. Even though the Han dynasty held the imperial court, how could it be attributed to the Wei? There is no doubt that it is an error.</p>
<p>Gu Tinglin's "Daily Knowledge Records" Volume 27, the entry on "Commentary on the Book of Han" states:</p>
<p>Yan Shigu wrote the "Preface" to the "Book of Han." The surnames listed, Deng Zhan and Wen Ying, both state, "During the Jian'an period of the Wei dynasty." Jian'an was the reign title of the Han Emperor Xian. Even though the government came from the Cao family, it should not be hastily attributed to the Wei.</p>
<p>Now, considering the aforementioned families, whether deeply knowledgeable in historical works or excelling in literary talent, how could they not know that Jian'an should be attributed to the Han and not to the Wei? However, they all followed suit, and this practice has persisted for generations. It is unlikely that those who use it are wrong and those who doubt it are right. Considering Liu Yuanlin's commentary on the "Wei Capital Rhapsody" in "Wen Xuan":</p>
<p>In front of the Wenchang Hall, there are bells, and their inscriptions say, "In the fourth year of the Wei dynasty, the year bing shen, the dragon in the fire, the fifth month bing yin, the bells for offering sacrifices were made, and also the Wu She bells." In the twenty-first year of Jian'an, the Yin bells were first placed in front of the Wenchang Hall, so that all directions could be informed.</p>
<p>The fourth year of Wei refers to the fourth year that Cao Cao was the Duke of Wei, which is the twenty-first year of Emperor Xian of Han's Jian'an reign. During the Han dynasty, feudal lords could declare their own first year, as stated in the "Huainan Astronomical Treatise": "The first year of Huainan, Taiyi was in bing zi." This is similar to the sixteenth year of Emperor Wen. In the "Table of Meritorious Marquises of Emperor Gaozu," the sixth year of Emperor Gaozu was the first year of Marquis Cao Shen of Pingyang. The sixth year of Emperor Hui was the first year of Marquis Jun of Jing. The fourth year after Emperor Wen was the first year of Marquis Qi of Jian. The fourth year of Emperor Jing was the first year of Marquis Shi of Yi. The fifth year of Yuanguang of Emperor Wu was the first year of Marquis Xiang of Gong. The third year of Yuanding was the first year of Marquis Zong of Jin. All these are examples. Ever since Cao Cao became the Duke of Wei in the eighteenth year of Jian'an and received additional gifts, in the seventh month, he first established the ancestral temples and altars of the Wei dynasty. Wang Can wrote the "Ode to the Grand Temple." In the beginning of the eleventh month, he established the six prefectures of the Shangshu and Shizhong. In the first month of the nineteenth year, he first plowed the imperial field. In the tenth month of the twentieth year, he established the titles of Marquis. In the third month of the twenty-first year, Cao Cao personally plowed the imperial field. Considering all these actions, none of them were not usurpations of the Son of Heaven. Canglang's "Poetry Talks" criticizes poetry, stating:</p>
<p>Liu Gonggan's poem presented to the General of the Five Offices, "In the past, I followed the first ruler, preparing the carriage to the southern countryside, passing the capital of Fengpei, flying together with you." The first ruler likely refers to Cao Cao, and going to the southern countryside refers to the time when he attacked Liu Biao. The capital of Fengpei is a metaphor for Cao Cao's deliberations on the commandery. Wang Zhongxuan's poem "Joining the Army" states, "Planning strategies in the tent, all depends on my sage ruler." The sage ruler also refers to Cao Cao. It also says, "I secretly admire the cauldron-bearing elder, willing to hone my dull talents." This is to emulate Yi Yin carrying the cauldron for Tang to attack Jie. At this time, the Han Emperor still existed, and the words of the two men were like this, one calling him the first ruler, the other calling him the sage ruler, just like Xun Yu comparing Cao Cao to Gao Guang. Some criticize Gonggan for treating beauties as not bending, which is not an understanding of people. The Spring and Autumn Annals' method of judging intent, how can the two men escape?</p>
<p>The deaths of Wang and Liu were both in the twenty-second year of Jian'an. At that time, Cao Cao had not yet died, and Pi had not yet usurped the Han. Yet their words were already like this. The "Commentary on the Biography of Emperor Hou of the Shu Kingdom of the Three Kingdoms" states:</p>
<p>According to ritual, when a ruler succeeds to the throne, the reign title is changed the following year. However, in the third year of Zhangwu, the reign title was changed to Jianxing, which is far from the principles of ritual.</p>
<p>Pei Songzhi's commentary states:</p>
<p>According to this, the reign titles of Jianwu and Jian'an were not changed for a long time. The former histories have not heard of this being praised.</p>
<p>Based on this, the reign title of Jian'an of Cao Wei was not changed for a long time, and the former histories have even criticized it. However, after the eighteenth year of Jian'an of the Han dynasty, the Son of Heaven held the imperial court, and the government was in the hands of the Cao family. Observing their division of fields and provinces to govern the world, such as the change of Lelang Commandery, even the Sima Jin dynasty mostly followed suit. Therefore, its lingering influence was far-reaching. Moreover, the Cao family, father and son, accumulated great talents and led the masses. Therefore, talented people emerged like clouds, forming a vibrant atmosphere, and later generations even had the term "Jian'an style." Therefore, the designation of Wei Jian'an, calling it by name, was a power taken from the old Han dynasty, adding Wei indicates a separation from Han. The name is a guest of reality, calling it Wei Jian'an, this is the historiographer's method of dividing eras.</p>
<h3 id="e141">Reading "The Jin History in the Governance Essentials from Various Books" <a href="#e141" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c141" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">141</a></h3>
<p>— Ran Zhaode</p>
<p>Mr. Hu Shi:</p>
<p>Yesterday, I read your article "The Jin History in the Governance Essentials from Various Books" in the ninth issue of the "Literary History" section of the February 7th "Shen Bao." You believe that the Jin History collected in "Governance Essentials" is the Jin History of Zang Rongxu. Your evidence is:</p>
<p>I looked at Huang Shi's collection of the Jin Histories of various families, "Examination of Lost Books in the Hanxuetang (?)", and referred to the saying in Fang Xuanling's biography that "Zang Rongxu's Jin History was used as the main source." Then, using the current Tang-edited Jin History for comparison, I can guess that the Jin History collected in "Governance Essentials" is Zang Rongxu's Jin History... Try comparing the Biography of Liu Yi (of the Western Jin) in the Jin History of Governance Essentials, the Biography of Liu Yi in Zang's History collected by Huang Shuang, and the Biography of Liu Yi in the current Jin History. Then compare the Biography of Tao Kan in these three versions. You can then know that the Jin History collected in Governance Essentials is Zang Rongxu's Jin History..."</p>
<p>The conclusion you obtained through conjecture and comparison is absolutely correct. However, this issue has already been settled by previous scholars. It seems that we should no longer conduct another round of textual research.</p>
<p>The third series of "Juxuexuan Congshu" contains "Jingshi Shangyilu" by Zhang Congxian of Xicheng, which contains an article "Discussion with Vice Minister Ruan on Examples of Lost Jin History," which discusses the Jin History collected in the "Governance Essentials." Zhang cites a total of six pieces of evidence, thus determining that the Jin History quoted by Wei Zheng is Zang Rongxu's Jin History. Excerpts are provided below for reference.</p>
<h3 id="e142">Discussion with Vice Minister Ruan on Examples of Lost Jin History <a href="#e142" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c142" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">142</a></h3>
<p>— Zhang Congxian</p>
<p>I have been shown the various biographies from the Jin History cited by Wei Zheng in Tang Dynasty's "Governance Essentials from Various Books," all of which are versions from before the Zhenguan era, and can be used to supplement lost texts. Now, examining the Jin History, from the Middle Revival and the Liu Song Dynasty, the Eastern (Jin) and Western (Jin) each had a separate history. It was only from Zang during the Southern Qi dynasty that the histories were combined into one family's history. In the Tang Dynasty before Wei Zheng, all citations of history that referred to "Jin History" were referring to Zang's history... The "New Tang History, Chronicle of Emperor Taizong" states in the tenth year of the Zhenguan era that Emperor Taizong ordered Fang Xuanling and others to revise the Jin History (note that neither "Liang Huiyao" nor "Liang Tangshu Chronicle of Emperor Taizong" record the re-compilation of the Jin History), using Zang Rongxu's Jin History as the base, and supplemented it with excerpts from various family chronicles and biographies. Therefore, the Jin History chronicles, treatises, and biographies cited by Wei Zheng are roughly the same as those contained in Xuanling's version, which is Zang's history. Shallow people see that the cited chronicles and treatises are similar in order to the current version and consider them to be the book of Fang et al. Qian Xiaozheng, Palace Attendant, wants to consider Wei Zheng's book as a false compilation, likely without examining it thoroughly. Those who cited Zang's Jin History during the Liang, Chen, and early Tang dynasties often did not attribute it to Zang, just as Tang people often did not attribute the "Later Han History" to Fan during the Tang dynasty... Wei Zheng's book cites the imperial chronicles beginning with Emperor Wen and ending with Emperor Jianwen. Emperor Wen is the third generation of the Western Jin, and Emperor Jianwen is the eighth generation of the Eastern Jin. This is the first piece of evidence that Zang's combined history can be verified. Wei Zheng's book cites the empress biographies, which Fang et al.'s book also treats as biographies. This is the second piece of evidence that Zang's book was used as the basis for Xuanling's work. The Western Jin books, such as Wang Yin's book, treat empresses as chronicles, using the example of Hua Qiao's "Later Han History." Fang et al.'s book uniquely treats them as biographies, which is still the old form of Zang's book. This is the third piece of evidence that can be verified. Rongxu's book divides records into chronicles, treatises, and biographies. The treatises in Fang et al.'s book are also based on the old examples. Therefore, Wei Zheng cites Zang's book as having treatises on penal law and treatises on officials. Wang Yin's Western Jin treatise book treats them as records, such as the "Record of Geography," seen in the "Water Classic Commentary." He Fasheng's Eastern Jin book treats the treatise on officials as a table of officials, using the example of Ban Gu's book in the former Han dynasty (original note, seen in "Beitang Shuchao"). Fang et al. still follow Zang's various treatises, and Wei's immediately cite Zang's book, which is not the book of Wang Yin or He Fasheng. This is the fourth piece of evidence that can be verified. Zhu Feng's book records from Emperor Gao to Emperor Yuan, which is the beginning of the Middle Revival. Wei Zheng's citation has already reached Emperor Jianwen, eight generations after the Middle Revival. Chu Yu's book records from Emperor Gao to Emperor Ming, which is the second generation of the Middle Revival. Wei Zheng's citation has already reached Emperor Jianwen, only three rulers away from the end of the Jin dynasty. This is definitely Zang's book, and not Zhu Feng's or Chu Yu's book. This is the fifth piece of evidence that can be verified. The records of Gan Bao, Lu Ji, Cao Jia, Xu Guang, Deng Can, Wang Shaozhi, and Liu Qianzhi, and the spring and autumn chronicles of Xi Shengchi and Tan Daoyue, all summarize events of different eras, without chronicles, treatises, or prefaces. The "Sui History" includes them in Miscellaneous History (note that the "Sui History" includes them in Ancient History, not Miscellaneous History) and does not list them with the official histories of Zhu, Yu, Wang, and He. Wei's citation further confirms that it is Zang's book, and not the records of the seven families of Gan, Deng, Cao, Xu, Lu, Wang, and Liu, or the spring and autumn chronicles of the two families of Xi and Tan. This is the sixth piece of evidence that can be verified. With these six pieces of evidence, we know that Wei Zheng's citation is Zang's book, and all single citations of Jin History during the Liang, Chen, Sui, and Tang dynasties that do not state the family name can be definitely determined to be Zang's book without doubt.</p>
<p>Zhang Congcheng's six pieces of evidence only establish arguments based on the style and beginning and ending points of the Jin histories of various families. Although he did not use the comparative work of each book, it is already sufficient to prove that the Jin History in "Governance Essentials" is definitely Zang Rongxu's Jin History. I do not know if you have any opinions for revision or supplementation regarding this statement? Respectfully wishing you peace, Ran Zhaode, bowing in sincerity (March 12th, Northwest University, Xi'an).</p>

<p>— Hu Shih</p>
<p>I am very grateful to Mr. Ran Zhaode for introducing Zhang Congcheng of Tongcheng's "On the Historical Examples of the Jin Dynasty with Minister Ruan." Zhang Congcheng's conjecture that the Jin Shu in Qun Shu Zhi Yao was Zang Rongxu's Jin Shu is a very rare insight at the time. However, older scholars often do not clearly understand the methods they use when conducting textual research, so their methods are often not very meticulous. For example, of the six pieces of evidence cited by Zhang, the second, third, and fourth are not sufficient as evidence. For example, the second piece of evidence says: "Wei Zheng's book quotes the Biography of Empresses and Consorts, and Fang Xuanling's book also makes a biography. This proves that Zang's book was the basis for Xuanling." This obvious evidence is not convincing.</p>
<p>Zhang's first, fifth, and sixth assumptions are tenable. However, these are all heavily focused on negative evidence, proving that what Zhi Yao collected was not the books of Zhu, Yu, Gan, Deng, and others. Positive evidence seems to be insufficient.</p>
<p>Therefore, I cannot agree with Mr. Ran's statement that "this issue has already been settled by previous scholars, and we do not seem to need to conduct another round of textual research." Because this issue has not been settled by previous scholars, compilers of lost works still do not recognize that what Zhi Yao adopted was Zang Rongxu's Jin Shu. Therefore, I propose using the method of comparing the content to strictly prove that the Jin Shu in Zhi Yao is indeed Zang's book. Only after this "textual research" can this issue be settled.</p>

<h3 id="e144">Also on Thrift <a href="#e144" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c144" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">144</a></h3>
<p>— Jingwen</p>
<p>It is said that the authorities are going to ban luxury goods again, and nylon stockings and imported cosmetics will soon be banned from sale, with violators subject to confiscation. Similar news seemed to have appeared in the newspapers a few months ago, but the result, apart from promoting hoarding and raising the prices of such goods, has not seen any other effect. What will be the effectiveness of this time, probably can also be "wait and see".</p>
<p>At this time of hardship for the general public, the extravagant lives of a few should naturally be restricted, but in view of the failures of previous thrift campaigns, there is a clear need to change the method of restriction. Past methods of restriction have often focused on formal, rigid regulations, such as the customs having explicit prohibitions on the import of certain types of luxury goods, and confiscating smuggled goods that are seized. However, these confiscated smuggled goods eventually flowed into the market through customs auctions. It is said that cunning people even smuggle goods that are strictly prohibited, secretly report them to the customs themselves, and then buy them back when the customs hold auctions, thus both obtaining secret reporting bonuses and "legally" selling their goods at high prices, making huge profits in a turn of the hand, and posing as legitimate merchants seeking profit from their capital. The reason why imported luxury goods continue to flow into the market today is partly due to this.</p>
<p>However, nylon and Max Factor, etc., are they really like opium? In terms of the current economic situation of the general public, although these things are close to luxury, if everyone has the ability to consume them, then it is not far from the realm of a prosperous and strong country. In fact, the prosperity of a country's economy depends on the consumption capacity of its people. And seeking a beautiful and comfortable life should be said to be the goal of human civilization. Eating canned food, fruits, and milk powder, etc., from a strict economic point of view, cannot be said to be extravagance at all, but only normal consumption.</p>
<p>However, there is a prerequisite here, that is, the consumption capacity of the national economy must be averaged. Nylon stockings and Max Factor cosmetics themselves cannot be said to be luxury goods. Only when a few people wear nylon stockings and cause millions of people to go barefoot, and a few people's faces are radiant and make millions of people look pale, do these things become luxury goods. Now the authorities want to strictly enforce thrift and prohibit the sale of such goods, which is of course based on this.</p>
<p>In today's urban life in China, the contradictory phenomenon of "behind the crimson gates meat and wine go to waste, while out on the road lie the bones of those who have frozen to death" can be found everywhere. This not only exposes the serious weaknesses of the national economy, but also makes the social gap increasingly deep. The decline of public morale and the anxiety of the people can all be found in this unbalanced national economic life.</p>
<p>However, simply prohibiting the sale of luxury goods has no effect. In a country that respects the system of private property, you cannot interfere with a person's freedom to dispose of their property. Rich people all have the attitude of "I have plenty of money, you can't control me!" And as long as businessmen can profit from it, they don't care about official or private goods. Besides, even if a dozen pairs of nylon stockings are confiscated, it won't be a capital crime. Don't you see what the so-called frugal dishes are still the result of today? I predict that after some so-called luxury goods are banned from sale one day, transactions will definitely be even more intense, at most making the way of buying and selling more "underground."</p>
<p>I think that instead of issuing a formal ban, it is better to imitate the state monopoly system practiced in the Soviet Union before the war, that is, in major cities, the state operates special stores that specialize in selling high-end imported luxury goods, and raises their prices significantly. On the one hand, it prohibits ordinary stores from selling such goods, and violators will not only have their goods confiscated, but also be subject to severe punishment. And use the profits from this state-run store to allocate to undertakings that benefit the national welfare. As for the types of luxury goods listed as state monopolies, they can be increased or decreased depending on the standard of living of the general public.</p>
<p>There are several advantages to doing this. The first is that it can meet the needs of those who need them, and the benefits are for society, while the same is consuming foreign exchange. Secondly, if the price is so high that even the rich are discouraged, then it can be said that the ban is implied in the levy.</p>
<p>Some people may say: In this way, the social gap will be even deeper. Isn't it equivalent to openly acknowledging the existence of privileged people for the state to monopolize luxury goods? But I think this is irrelevant. Those who can afford luxury goods now are originally a small number of people. If everyone in China has the ability to enjoy what are currently called imported luxury goods, then they would no longer be luxury goods long ago. And for these few people, persuasive thrift and rigid bans will not have any effect. Therefore, it is better to openly acknowledge their special status, and the method of high-priced monopoly may have a slight effect of restraint.</p>
<p>However, from an economic point of view, reducing expenditure is originally a last resort, and it is best to be able to focus on increasing income. A country's economic policy, if it specializes in reducing people's consumption and enjoyment, is enough to say a word of pity. Especially if thrift is promoted and a few people are still allowed to live an extravagant life, it should be said to be unreasonable. If we really want to talk about thrift, then we should learn from the example of Britain after the war. The thrift policy they implemented is one that simultaneously focuses on increasing income and reducing expenditure. If our authorities do not have this courage, then they may as well adopt my idea, openly acknowledge the special status of the rich, which may be more practical than an ostrich-like thrift.</p>
<h3 id="e145">Luxurious Stores <a href="#e145" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c145" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">145</a></h3>
<p>— Mao Yi</p>
<p>Although the center of the women's fashion industry in the United States is in New York, the giants of the fashion industry are not in New York, but in the "Neiman Marcus store" in Dallas, the capital of Texas. It holds a fashion exhibition at the Baker Hotel every week at lunchtime, and many rich ladies travel a long way to visit; it presents awards to the best tailors every year, and the New York newspapers publish these news in large formats.</p>
<p>Neiman Marcus is not only famous for its fashion, but also for its luxury. It sells fur coats for 16,500 yuan, clothes made for 695 yuan, handbags for 75 yuan, hats for 160 yuan, handkerchiefs for 150 yuan, and sapphire necklaces for 48,000 yuan—the prices are of course in US dollars.</p>
<p>What made this store successful were the extravagant Texans. They made a fortune from operating oil, wheat, cattle, sheep, or cotton, and spending thousands or even tens of thousands of dollars is nothing.</p>
<p>The store once published an advertisement selling a large diamond ring weighing 24.35 carats, priced at 127,000 US dollars. Soon there was a customer who wrote on an ordinary postcard: "Please send the diamond ring advertised, and charge the price to my account"—a big deal was concluded so easily.</p>
<p>Every year at Christmas, Neiman Marcus is decorated intricately, and last year's theme was "White Christmas." The entire window display was white: a white feather Christmas tree, hung with a sparkling white diamond bracelet, surrounded by fantastic white gifts, from silver fox robes to milky white glass tableware, everything was complete. A young oil tycoon saw it, and he did not hesitate to order the store to completely move the goods in the entire window to his home on Christmas Eve, at a cost of 35,000 US dollars.</p>
<p>The population of Dallas is only 450,000, but oil has fattened them, and the annual consumption of fashion reaches 12 million gold dollars, which shows how extravagant they are.</p>

<p>Farewell Intention</p>
<p>It is impossible to find where the spring has returned, the garden is full of singing birds and deep green shade. How much do you know about the falling of flowers in the forest? This made the poet chant all night long.</p>
<p>My heart is desolate in every way, thorns lie across the path, and the white sun sets in the west. Hearing the sound of returning, the cuckoo cries on the Tianjin Bridge.</p>
<p>Peach Blossom Remaining on a Branch in the Wind and Rain</p>
<p>Green on the study window, half leaning, light clouds as mist, willow silk drooping. Inadvertently realize that the spring is late, peach blossoms remaining on a branch in the wind and rain.</p>
<h3 id="e147">Stealing Poetry <a href="#e147" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c147" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">147</a></h3>
<p>— Qian Dacheng</p>
<p>Meng Dongye has a poem called "Stealing Poetry." I have read it dozens of times and still don't know how to explain it. I don't know what his intention is. I think he must be referring to something. However, the fact of stealing poetry has existed since ancient times, and it is still unavoidable today. Plagiarism of articles is even more commonplace. It is said that Qu Wengshan, one of the three masters of Lingnan, stole a poem from a monk. Fan Fanshan took several volumes of Li Yueman's diary, so he always hid and did not come out. The biggest reason was that he had completely copied the Li poems in those volumes of diary. Ten years ago, a certain arrogant person stole on a large scale and in a special way. He not only stole poems from contemporary people, but also stole poems from ancient people. He even stole poems that everyone knew and would definitely recognize, which was too bold. Recently, the poet Chen Boying was also stolen dozens of poems by him. He was extremely angry and jokingly inscribed five four-character poems on the "elegant thief's" glorious poetry collection, ridiculing with joy and anger, which was very amusing. I will copy them below: "A book jumps out, dragons soar and phoenixes dance, everything has its origin, like Du Gongbu. (One) Taking the delicacies of the Five Marquises and forming one's own school of thought, being born a Buddha, this is called wisdom root. (Two) Using my brushwork to come to your writing essentials, being extremely familiar and flowing, this is also called knowing oneself. (Three) Beautiful eyebrows are jealous, and heroes appreciate each other. You are originally a beauty, why be a thief? (Four) Separating bones to return to father, separating flesh to return to mother, Nezha Prince, good luck white lotus root. (Five)" This person also copied other people's elegies, but he himself was only a young man at the time and had not yet married. It's laughable. At that time, leaders of the poetry world such as Chen Shiyi and Jin Songcen were deceived, and even compared him to Yi Shifu, calling him a child prodigy. In fact, this person was too fond of fame. At the same time, I also thought of Emperor Yang of Sui, who loved the line "Swallows fall on the empty beam, plastering mud" from his minister (I remember it was Xue Daoheng?), and wanted to take it away from him. When he could not take it away, he was extremely jealous and killed the minister. At the same time, he said, "Can you still write "Swallows fall on the empty beam, plastering mud" now?" With the dignity of an emperor, he became extremely jealous for the sake of a line of poetry. It is really difficult to explain his intention. Perhaps he deeply felt what Cao Pi said: "Life has a time to end, and glory and joy are limited to oneself. Both are inevitable and constant periods, not as good as the endlessness of writing," right? This is also a unique shot in terms of literary inquisition, rare in ancient and modern times. Loving other people's poems and having the idea and action of stealing them can still be considered the behavior of the weak. It is said that Yi Shifu, a talented man of Longyang, loved the line "Green shadows peek into the window" in the ghost poems of the eight-fingered monk Jichan, and wanted to buy it from Jichan, but Jichan refused. Yi Shifu's own poems were actually much better than Jichan's, which was really inexplicable, but it was passed down as a good story. Lu Xun said, "The article is good in itself." It is not necessarily entirely true. Some people feel that it is like a wife, and other people's are good too. Since there is stealing jade and comparing it to fragrance in the world, there will naturally be stealing poetry. Because of the love of fame and stealing poetry, compared to plagiarizing other people's articles for the sake of royalties, I still side with the elegant thief who steals poetry.</p>
<h3 id="e148">Casual Talks on Letters <a href="#e148" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c148" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">148</a></h3>
<p>— Zheng Yimei</p>
<p>I have no interest in what people like in singing, dancing, dogs, and horses, but I like antiques, flowers, calligraphy, and letters from famous people, and I am especially fond of letters from famous people. What I have collected are mostly letters from the late Qing Dynasty, the early Republic of China, and contemporary celebrities, about hundreds of them. Some value their character, some value their calligraphy, and some value their words. And those who are extremely evil and wicked are also included. The stationery at that time was often self-made, such as Wu Keqi's Dragon Knot Stationery, Chen Jieqi's Yu Qi Stationery, Ye Juchang's Five Hundred Sutra Pillar Hall Stationery, Xu Huanong's Imperial Sacredly Bestowed Stationery, Wu Yinpei's Dew凝書屋 Stationery, Yuan Cai's Ju Yan Zhai Stationery, Liu Shishu's Small Suddenly Thunder Pavilion Stationery, Du Wenlan's Mandala Flower Pavilion Stationery, Xu Zhongke's Wash Feet Ten Thousand Miles Flow Stationery, Zhou Zhiqi's Yan Nan Xiá Stationery, Hu Shiyu's Plum Blossom Habit and Cold as Fate Stationery, Hong Jun's One 　Flower Shadow Stationery, Zhang Mingke's Cold Pine Pavilion Stationery, Yin Guang's Yongming Fire Master Four Materials 　; Bao Xi's Ink Edge Hall Stationery, Liang Dingfen's 　Hua Room Stationery, Luo Zhenyu's Great Auspicious Stationery, Yu Tingying's Tan Pian Shanfang Stationery, Liu Gonglu's Chu Garden Stationery, Yuan Hanyun's Han Bi Yu　Wen Stationery, antique and fragrant, I cherish them very much.</p>
<p>Although the era is very recent, those that are rarely seen outside of their hometowns, such as the great lyricist Kuang Zhou, Pan Lengcan, who died in the Huanghuagang Uprising of the seventy-two martyrs, Xie Jinyuan, the commander of the isolated army, the eminent monk Hongyi, and the Cantonese poet Yi Dachang, were given to me by friends, and they are as precious as jade. As the saying goes, things return to what one likes, indeed!</p>
<p>I saw a lot of Ming Dynasty letters at my late friend Pan Boshan's place, such as Wang Yangming, Shi Kefa, Yan Song, Tang Liuru, and Zhu Yunming. Although the virtuous and the treacherous are judged differently, their calligraphy is exquisite. And when they wrote letters at that time, the stationery was relatively large, probably because the so-called letter was measured in terms of being one foot long and wide. There are also palace letters from the Song Dynasty. I have a box of them, a total of one hundred frames. Those that are absolutely lovely, such as Shi Bi and Wen Yanbo, have extremely fluent characters, making people imagine the state of their writing like flying. Sima Guang is cautious and neat. Ouyang Xiu's style is noble and gorgeous, and his skill is comprehensive. Zhao Bu's letters have only a few words, but his seals are numerous. Wang Jinggong's strokes are unrestrained and have a unique cold charm. What Su Dongpo called the lawless law cannot be learned. Mi Nan Gong's letters are deep and flying, and are especially wonderful. Dongpo and his eldest son Mai are sparse and unrestrained, and they are all short letters. Xiao Su Ziyou is strong and good. Huang Tingjian's letter to Tongguan Scholar Zhi Wu Jiu is leisurely and full of meaning, which shows his high mind. Others, such as Han Zaiwang's boldness, Cai Junmo's flying, Li Gang's plumpness, and Qian Fu's Xiao San, each have their own faces, and their concise and lofty words can be a model.</p>
<p>Living in Shanghai is cramped, and the room is only enough to accommodate the knees. Only collecting letters takes up little space. Whether I display them in front of the window or appreciate them under the lamp, the dust and vulgarity in my heart are swept away, which is very pleasant! The only regret is that there are not many like-minded people who collect letters, and it is not as common as collecting stamps. Otherwise, we can learn from each other, exchange what we have and what we don't have, which is worth promoting.</p>

<p>— Guoping</p>
<p>The "long-lived emperors" I am referring to do not refer to long life, but to the long number of years in power. In fact, those who are in power for a long time are also long-lived.</p>
<p>The first is Louis XIV of France, who reigned for a full seventy-two years. Louis XIV's most famous saying is "I am the state." He built many extremely luxurious palaces, the most famous of which is the Palace of Versailles, which everyone knows. Unfortunately, his policies were wrong, foreign wars continued, and he squandered money, resulting in an empty treasury and suffering for the people, which caused the distant cause of the French Revolution.</p>
<p>The second is Queen Victoria of England, who reigned for sixty-eight years. Everyone knows that the Victorian era was the golden age of England, and politics, economics, literature, art, etc. all reached their peak.</p>
<p>The third is Franz Joseph of Austria, who reigned for sixty-eight years. When Joseph was in power, he happened to encounter Hungary breaking away from Austria and becoming independent, but with his ability, he finally kept the country safe.</p>

<p>— Jinlin</p>
<p>American novelist Hawthorne always washed his hands before reading his wife's letters.</p>
<p>German philosopher Kant did not allow anyone to talk to him during his daily walks.</p>
<p>###</p>
<p>With the implementation of the Constitution, everything is new, and someone asked about the official document format issued by the civil service office. The five branches of government are parallel, all being high-level central agencies. However, the members and heads of the Legislative and Control Yuans are elected, while those of the Executive, Examination, and Judicial Yuans are appointed. Therefore, when the President issues documents to the Legislative and Control Yuans, he must use "Consultation," while to the Executive, Judicial, and 　Yuans, he can use "Order." It seems that the system of the five Yuans cannot maintain the solemnity of "five peaks standing side by side." I said that the gains and losses in this can be compared with old precedents.</p>
<p>According to the terms and methods of "Consultation," they were based on previous generations, while "Order" was created in the Republic of China. In the old days, orders were used from top to bottom, and statements and details were used from bottom to top. Parallel lines used "Consultation" and "Transfer." In the Republic of China, "Order" was used from top to bottom, meaning command and order, which was very appropriate. But in the old days, only the military camps had orders, and the political world had nothing. And the old "Statement, Detail, Report" were all abolished. (Yuan Shikai changed it so that superiors used "Instruction" to subordinates, and subordinates used "Detail" to superiors, only the President could use "Order" to all subordinates. Therefore, the only old name that has been used for more than thirty years in the Republic of China and is still used today is "Consultation."</p>
<p>At the beginning of the Republic of China, only the Congress used "Consultation" to the President. The reason was that the members and speakers of both houses were elected, and that legislation and administration were parallel but not subordinate. At that time, the powers of the Congress were expanded, and its arrogance was boundless. All major ceremonies such as "Constitution Making" and "Electing the President" were organized jointly by the members of the two houses, which was nothing short of monopolizing them. And 　monitoring and impeaching could directly consult with the head of state, which was not only a legislative body, but directly like a Supreme Government, which was inherently unreasonable. The current system has been completely corrected, "Constitution Making" and "General Election" belong to the National Assembly, and legislation and supervision are also divided into two Yuans, which are already clear. The Legislative Yuan has the right to approve the President of the Executive Yuan, and the Control Yuan also has the right to approve the heads of the Judicial and Examination Yuans, which is to respect elections and is a sign of democratic significance. Then the system of the Legislative and Control Yuans, although parallel to the three Yuans, the official document format cannot but be slightly different, which is very reasonable.</p>
