<h3>對於美國援華問題　張院長特發表聲明　闡述十項財政經濟改革</h3>
<p>〔中央社南京廿八日電〕行政院院長張羣，頃發表中國政府關於美國援華問題之聲明，此項聲明，華顯光局長於廿八日記者招待會中正式宣佈。該聲明稱：中國經歷八年有餘之長期抗戰，益於共黨之叛變，故今日遭遇空前之經濟困難，中國政府爲克服此種困難起見，鋻於中美兩國之悠久友誼，已提請美國政府予我以經濟的及技術的援助，美國國會所沛過之臨時援助法案，經將中國列入，美國政府並已聲明將於美國國會本屆會議中，提出對華切宵援助辦法，中國政府對此表示忻慰。中國政府自知其必須有完備切實的自助計劃，而使一般行政改革與軍事改革繼之實施或相輔而行，巾國政府所準備實施之主要財政經濟改革，約如下述：</p>
<p>儘可能範國節减政府一切支出——法幣支出與外幣支出。　改善國稅省稅地方稅制及其管理，俾達增加收入與平均負担之雙重目標。　爲增進公務員及軍官士兵之工作效率，其待遇將逐漸予以提高，一面並實施員額之逐漸縮减計劃。　日川品供給之控制必須加强，並擴大範圍，藉以防止投機與物價之暴漲。　盡力建立一種使幣制趨於穩定之基礎，傳外援得收最大功效。　改善銀行與信用制度，加强中央銀行之管制責任，繼續推行遏止通貨膨脹之政策。　鼓勵貨物出口，盡力排除出口之障礙。　改進進口貨之管制，俟環境許可時，管制辦法之含有緊急措施性者，當酌予變更。　發展農業生產，改善農村經濟，并實施土地改革，中美農業技術合作團之建議，其可提前實施者，即予採行。　儘可能範圍恢復交通及重要工礦業，以期增加生產，减少過分依賴舶來品之輸入。（編者按：上列十項改革要點，曾於廿四日本報刋出）</p>
<p>〔中央社華盛頓廿八日電〕我駐美大使館，今日在此問發表行政院院長張羣所宜佈將由中國政府推行之十點財政經濟改革方案，此項聲明，在南京同時發表，此復興方案之發表，適值我國技術代表團在此間與美國官方人士舉行商談之時，並適値美國援華計劃向國會提出之前夕。</p>
<h3>馬卿昨接見貝祖詒　援華計畫下月初可望提出</h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿八日電〕據此間獲悉：美國務卿馬歇爾，廿八日下午接見我赴美技術代表團團長貝祖飴，貝氏係由顧維鈞大使陪往者。外部人士雖表示不能透露晤談內容，但對此一予人鼓勵的發展，顯然感覺愉快。</p>
<p>〔中央社華盛頓廿七日電〕馬歇爾國務卿上週曾謂，渠擬於「一週內」向全國顧問委會及預算局提出援華計劃，馬卿所謂之一週，將於廿九日屆滿。</p>
<p>〔中央社華盛頓廿七日合衆電〕某消息靈通人士稱：杜魯門總統可望於二月上半月內向國會提出援華計劃。又稱：國務院已將計劃送交預算局，然後再送全國顧問委會完成其整理預備工作，以便提交立法機構討論。渠拒不透露援華計劃所列之貸款總數但表示將在三億美元以上，此三億之數，乃二月以前馬歇爾在國會議會催促之下所提出者。渠又指出，預算局對援華計劃應能迅鄧予理，因其　不涉及特別複雜之財政計算也，全國顧問委會，爲對此種事務之政策機構，故預料對此一計劃，亦將同樣迅速予以處理，因國會要求早日提出此項計劃之壓力，在與日俱增也。上述各種因素，皆爲援華計劃可及早提交國會之預兆，據聞若幹官方人士，對馬歇爾之秘密政策曁其遲不決定援華計劃，皆表不滿，除周以德與其他少數向主援華者外，與上述官方人士意見相同者，尙有若干共和黨人士，如參院撥款委會主席勃里奇等是。</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕紐約廿八日廣播：克里普斯霍華特系報紙今日著評，力促美國加緊援華，內稱：中共勢刀範圍正日益擴張中，前途可處。東北爲遠東之鎖鑰，不惟控制中國與朝鮮，抑且爲通往西比利里與日本之門戶。第一次世界大戰之發生，即種因於日本之攫取東北。自經濟觀點言之，東北之與亞洲，猶如魯爾區之與歐洲。由國在大戰中，曾牽制日軍數百萬人，爲美國之忠實盟友，當此緊急之際，美國應予援助。</p>
<h3>九龍城及沙面兩案　須分先後解決　王外長中政會報吿</h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿八日電〕沙面事件將侯　龍問題解決後再循國際　例解決，倫敦方面就沙面事件　　所提出之抗議，我政府亦將侯　龍問題解決後再作硏討答覆，此爲王外長廿八日在中政會外　報吿中所提及者。</p>
<p>時昭瀛談話</p>
<p>〔本報南京廿八日電〕關於中英交涉，外部情報司　，廿八日在政院新聞局記者招待會席上穴稱：九龍城及穗沙面　事件仍在中英政府交涉中，期　獲致合理而能使雙方滿意之解决。英外部廿四日致找駐英大使鄭天錫之照會，（內容見另條）係就九龍城事件經過之英方看法加以闡明。我國對之尙未答覆。英大使館發言人廿八日亦對記者稱：交涉仍在進行，盼能早日解決。至我對英使館就沙面事件允予賠償一點，渠堅稱確巳獲得中國外交部之書面答覆，然我外部發宮人稱：日前英大使館參事雷博濟訪歐洲司長尹葆字時，尹氏曾以文件交渠，文件中僅載明對穗沙面英領館遭焚燬事，將依國際　例處理，此與情報司長時昭　氏廿一日對記者公開宣佈之立塲並無二致，然如謂此項宜佈即係謂應允賠償等具體答復，似尙過平。我方現仍等待英政府對我爲九龍城事件所提抗議之答覆，至穗沙面事件，我方尙須俟詳盡調查完畢後，始克作具體決定。</p>
<h3>對泰晤士報社評　董顯光有所糾正</h3>
<p>〔中央社南京廿八日電〕董顯光局長廿八日在記者招待會席問談稱：一月廿四日倫敦泰晤士報社評有稱，「中國當局似已鑒及若干中國報紙鼓噪宣傳之反英運動，有損害中英邦交之危險，故對於沙面事件之新聞，除由政府主管機構發佈者外，已禁止登載，」此種言論，完全曲解中國政府與報界之關係，亟應糾正，以正視聽，本人可負責聲明，任何政府機構，從未「禁止有關沙面事件新聞之登載。」憲政業已實施，絕無「禁止登载」之可能。本人主管行政院新聞局，聆此言詞，自將該報所稱之「政府主管機構」或即指本人爲准一奉令發佈有關沙面事件之新聞者，對泰晤士報社評所稱，殊感驚奇，本人亟願獲知此項訓令係何人所發，而發令者根據何種權力。</p>
<h3>調查沙面案事畢　潘漢逵返京覆命</h3>
<p>〔本報廣州廿八日電〕來穗負責調查沙面事件之潘漢達氏，因事稽延，廿八日始難穗飛京覆命</p>
<p>〔聯合社南京廿八日電〕報載英政府同意釋放九龍城被拘華人，並允在談話期間不再實施逮捕等說，已由英大使館予以否認。</p>
<h3>關於九龍城事件　英發表致我照會</h3>
<p>希望管轄權與勒遷事盼別處置</p>
<p>〔路透社倫敦廿七日電〕英外交部二十七日正式發表於二十四日致中國駐英大使鄭天錫博士關於九龍城事件照會之內容，表示英國誠意盼望儿龍城之管轄權問題，得與最近勒令「佔住」居民遷移之問題，個別處置。英政府對於關於九龍未來地位之談判，尙在京進進期間，竟發生因勒遷事而引起之暴動，深表扼腕，英國認爲前項談判尙在進行階段，政府希望不久能以其意見，向中國政府提出。英政府之照會，並指出如果香港政府，因九龍城管轄權問題尙在討論階段，而不能爲九龍區之福利採取行政措施，將爲一重大錯誤。照會於檢討舊城區居民之被勒遷及港警於一月五“並指責中國報紙，數星期來嘗有計劃地煽動反英運動，例如香港國民日報，嘗刋載誇大及曲解性之報吿。再者，　安縣長於港方首次執行勒遷令後。在中國國旗下向九龍城居民致辭亦不失爲挑撥性的行勸，而中國報紙竟認此項行動，在重申中國之主權，英政府認爲香港政府決定淸除佔住區域，具有充分理由，且認港政府對於「佔住」居民，已予以週詳之顧慮，英政府復認全部事實經過，苟能以適當狀態公諸中國民衆，必能以更安靜而客觀的精神，觀察此整個問題。故照會最後特別强調將全部事實公諸中國民衆之適宜性。照會對於廣州事件，並未提及。按英國最近曾照會中國要求賠償廣州英國財產於反英運動時所受之損失，中國政府其後提出之照會，未曾提及英方此項要求，僅要求英方賠償九龍城事件之損失。</p>
<h3>我外部發言人　對英照會竟見</h3>
<p>述明九龍城事件原因</p>
<p>〔中央社南京廿八日電〕中央社記者頃以英外相貝文致鄭天錫大使照會事，叩詢外部發言人時司長昭瀛意見。據稱：我國人民固甚願進一步得知英國官方對於九龍城事件之觀點，但中國人民決能憶及我外交部及其駐港代表在一月五日以前，曾嚴重勸吿香港政府，在我國從未放棄治權之地域，不得採取强制措施，並於一月十二日以前，再三重申此項嚴重勸吿，香港政府對上項勸吿之未予適當考慮，實爲造成一月十二日開槍及擲催淚彈不幸事件之主要原因。</p>

<h3>美對和會問題　顯露緩開意向</h3>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓廿七日常〕靈通方面廿七日談稱，美國已「事實上放棄」其力促早日召開對日和會之意向，反之，美國將增加努力在佔領下協助日本經濟復興，可等候更適當之時間，再致力於日本和會一事。據稱：關於比事尙未採取堅決之決定，據最近美官員之討論，相信彼　將在二項途徑中抉擇其一：（下接二版一欄）</p>

<h3>改善公敎人員待遇　監委建議書擬就　送呈於院長即轉呈國府</h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿八日電〕監院二十六日談話會通過爲公敎人員改善待遇事之建議書，業經擬就，由苗培成于樹德等委員十九人聯名提出於二十八日送呈于院長右任，即將轉呈國府，茲誌建議書全文如次：</p>
<p>「爲建議事：此次調整公敎人員待遇規定按生活指數發給，每三個月調整一次，關於配給實物，除每人每月發給食米二斗外，餘如油，煤，布，糖，鹽等物一律取消。查立法院參政會及本院前建議改善公敎人員待遇，擬請按月依照生活指數調整，幷仍配給原有實物，現時物價波動劇烈，指數逐時飛揚，三個月調整一次，實與生活指數大相懸殊，公敎人員底薪一百元者在去年十二月份薪津爲一百三十九萬元（生活補助費九十九萬元，加成數四十萬元），實物按市價差額約爲一百四十餘萬元（麵粉兩袋八十七萬元，食油三斤七萬餘元，煤球兩擔二十餘萬元，糖兩斤三萬餘元，鹽四斤兩萬餘元，布約折二十萬元），約共二百八十餘萬元（生活補助費節餘尙不在內），本年二月份若照新調整辦法計算，薪津及米價僅爲三百五十餘萬元（三十元基本生活指數折計二百五十五萬兀，七十元十分之一之指數五十九萬五千兀，食米三斗價約三十六萬元），兩月相比，二月份僅增加七十餘萬元，但二月份之物價高於上年十二月奚止數倍故此次調整，在公敎人員不但無所增益，且反减低，因之生活更感困難。政府爲各大都市公敎人員配給實物，原爲平抑物價，控制市塲，一旦將已有之配給取消，則使大批消費者競向市塲爭取物資，激漲物價，勢所難免；此項辦法，實與經濟緊急措施方案相背馳，殊失調整待遇之本意。委員等有鑒於此，且以安定公教人員生活，即所以安定政治，擬請建議恢復原配給辦法，或自二月份起對於公敎人員待遇按照生活指數每月調整一次，藉資補救，是否有當，敬乞　核轉呈（銜略）。</p>

<h3>工貨應否在定貨方式下開放？</h3>
<p>所謂定貨貸款辦法，本是經濟改革方案的重要節目之一，其作用及得失如何，本報前曾爲文分別指出。今一切貸款，雖俱在停頓之中，而最近所公表的各種實施辦法，此等貸款方式，並未予以刪除。且以北方請願團的迫切呼籲，與各地工商界的一致要求，當局對於工業貸款，已在重行考慮，大勢所趨，似頗有透過此項方式，而酌予開放之可能。如全面配給辦法實行展開，把握物資將成爲配給的重要條件，則以定貨代替採購，其必然　將愈見增加。</p>
<p>不過對於這個問題，當局與工商界的見解，似乎未必書同，因爲當局所重在把握物資，其於金融上的周轉，似尙屬其次，而當業的目光，則重在資金融通，是否願意輕易地放棄其物　，還是問題。這理由是很淺顯的。在這物價步漲，囤積成爲最有利益的時候，誰願隨產隨銷，坐失其眼前十拿九穩的利益？從事工業，在目前最爲艱苦，又誰肯以圖得貸款之故，而儘量拋出定貨，只博些表面上合法的利潤？而况照過去官價收購的例子，與官方所定的講價限價，又往往過於苛刻，實　上太不合理，使生產者望而却步；而種種例外的花費與攤派，及原料補進的困難，機件補充的不易，且工資照指數計算和捐稅動力隨時調整以後，未來的成本計算，又倍極困難，大體上且不免與日俱增；在這種種非常情形之下，除非萬不得已，不得不飲鴆止渴，暫救燃眉之急外，他們對於定貨貸款，恐　必能踴躍應命，適如當局之所意料。</p>
<p>當然，這種貸款，原沒有强制性的。政府正在緊縮銀根，收縮通貨，以期抑平物價。廠商如果不願承貸，自行設法，又豈非當局所樂聞？不過以融通困難之故，而影響於目前之生產，且與未來發展以嚴重的打擊，這在整個的國民經濟上看來，似很値得注意。現在定貨貸款尙未推行，只不過於花紗布的管制方案中，預定了一個代紡代織和統購統銷等方針，但因此之故，紡織界中已不乏儘量緊縮的準備。這於定貨貸款的進行上，多少是一種堪供參考的資料。</p>
<p>卽使廠商樂於承受，這種貸款方式，可以順利地展開，我們對於牠的範圍和效用，也不得不加以相當的保留。因爲政府定貨，其主要的用途，當在實行配給，其次則爲軍用與公用。則凡軍用，公用與配給之外，其餘所定進的鉅額貨物，究竟作何用途，亦不可不先加計議。如　隨進隨銷，供應市面，則有類於商業國營，除民生重要必需品外，在種種经濟方案及措置中，並未定有此項政策。倘或暫行存儲，待價而沽，又何解於取缔囤積居奇辦法之所規定？最理想的辦法，當然是調劑有無，把當地所產的大宗製品，分別運銷到其他各處去，但以紗布，米糧，煤斤，人絲等採運的成例看來，又很難相信現在的物資機關，會有此充裕的能力。不見棉花的採辦，依舊要委托他人來辦理嗎？又不見備區山積的存煤，竟無法運到各大都市來濟用嗎？照此推論，所謂定貨貸款，很可能地還是縮小範圍，指定某某幾種貨物如民生日用必需品來　辦，亦可能地指定某某區域如上海等市來試　。這在主辦機關，肩荷較輕，或可易於集事，而在　給方面，亦可獲得很大的助力。但這種局部的計劃，只是替主辦機關打算，並沒有顧到政府扶助工商增加生產這重大使命，更沒有顧到各地工商界很普徧的屬望，</p>
<p>本來貸款的推行，不論採取何種方式，其另一方面的意義，卽是增加發行，膨脹通貨，因而刺激物價，危害民生，所以痛定思痛，不得不採取所謂「金融斷流」政策，以矯正現在的局勢。這原是不得已的辦法。但在他種方式的貸款之下，其所貸的對象與數額，尙可任由國家行局選擇，或借或不借，或多或寡，其主動權完全操在國行之手，假如定貨貸款一經實行，則凡合得上這個、條件的，論理，便　小分親疎，一例看待：而且所貸的數目，更應以所　出產　定貨爲標準，不應隨意核减或自由迎　。否　定貸貸款的政策，便不能完全貫徹。所以國家行局有沒有這種鉅款來應付這件事，換句　說：可否　擴大發行來承受這項貸款，這問題却是十分緊要的。我們以爲對於某廠的牛產予以定貨貸款，而對於他廠同樣產品　或予拒絕，這是不　　的，對於某厰一部分的　品予以定貨貸款，而對於同廠同一產品或予拒絕，亦是不合理的；對於甲地某廠產品予以定貨貸款，而對於乙丙……等地廠家同一產品概予拒絕，更是不合理的。過去各種貸款，往往遭人非難指爲偏袒某種階級，其原因就在於厚薄不一。現在推行定貨貸款，如果仍沒有普徧一律的辦法，則與其在公佈實施之後，發生種種困難，再從而醫頭醫脚，造成許多偏枯不勻的現象，莫如在未公佈和未實施前，縝密研究，以期折衷至當，推行　利。所以這個貸款辦法，現在時機雖漸成熟，似已箭在弦上，不得不發，但我們鰓鰓過慮·却願大家再愼重考慮一下。當然，我們並不是反對開放貸款，也不是絕對反對這個貸款方式，母寗說是贊成相當的貸款的，但不願見過去種種貸款缺點，依舊留存於將來。</p>
<h3>美國對和會意向</h3>
<p>〔上接一版〕繼續加施壓力，俾早日召開對日和會，對堅持在和會中保留否決權之中蘇兩國採取妥協態度。　承認巾蘇與英美之異議在目前不能接近，此事應予放棄，直至未來發展改變局　，使折表辦法成爲可能。此問官員了解，中國之所以不贊成參加無否決權之和會，蓋恐美國對日本之工業水準採取過份姑息之態度，中國如無否決權，對此將無能爲力然彼等稱：在工業水準上，有兩點與中國意見不能一致：即　中國所定之水準，不足以使日本自給自足，而必須覓取外國之協助。　美國屆時必須予以協助，而政府恐將有納稅公民起而反對之一日。綜此二點原因，美國決定將早日召開和會之希望暫時擱置，以覓取協調。</p>
<h3>西藏商務團抵滬</h3>
<p>（上接一版）</p>
<p>留印月餘</p>
<p>該團一行，俱為西藏政治及商業界有地位份子，團長夏古巴現任拉薩銀局總辦，渠等係於兩月前離藏赴印，在印度留居月餘，參觀各地商業情形。聞過去西藏與印度問商業交易甚少，每年僅由印度輸人少量布疋與鐵，而西藏特產羊毛，皮革，藥材，亦僅假印度出口，轉輸英美等國，故渠等在印除參觀外，並未進行若何商務上之接洽。</p>
<p>團長談話</p>
<p>據夏古巴氏談稱：西藏過去與外間物產交易，動輸途徑有四：即　經由雲南，　經由康定，　經由靑海，　水路則多經由印度。過去囚無正確統計，故物產交易數量無法調查，此次該團來內地考察主要任務即爲詳細硏究藏胞所需物產者何處採購最爲合算，徑山何處運輸最稱便捷，以備將來回藏後擬定計劃，與內地正式大量通商。聞藏胞需要最切之物產爲茶，綢緞，與瓷器。</p>
<p>西藏現況</p>

<p>不日晉京</p>
<p>該團一行由印抵港途中，均穿著藏服，嗣在　因受居民注意圍觀，行動不便，故來滬後已改易西服。</p>
<p>該團此來，携有達賴喇嘛及授政打扎致主席之函件，及西藏土產多件，渠等擬在滬勾留二日，即晋京謁見主席呈遞，同時並將分謁蒙藏委員會許委員長及有關各部會，商談今後西藏與內地物產交易辦法，如時問充裕，尙擬赴北平考察一次。</p>

<p>東北方面，匪二·七兩縱隊全部及八縱隊一部，並糾集砲兵旅主力，共六萬餘人，向我新立屯竄犯，自二十日起至目前爲止，匪軍傷亡過半，仍不能越雷池一步，造成國軍輝煌戰績。爲配合新立屯之勝利，國軍又在各地採取機動掃蕩，十八日國軍在遼西北鎭痛殲殘匪第八縱隊，遼北國軍勁旅於廿四日一舉收復東　西　，永吉國軍亦展開掃蕩，於廿日收復樺皮廠及其他重要據點多處。</p>
<p>華北方面，聶榮臻匪部自從在保定外圍慘敗後，刻分股流竄，其五七兩縱隊殘部則逃向滿城以西山地藏匿，其第一縱隊逃向齋堂，途中經我空軍轟炸，傷亡慘重，廿四日竄踞張坊西北山地裏去了。四縱隊殘部則由望都東竄，廿四日主力竄踞任邱，刻平保路兩側已無匪踪。</p>
<p>蘇魯豫皖方面之陳毅匪部，一週來迭遭國軍壓迫，處處被動，刻被國軍截成兩段，其第十·十一兩縱隊殘部，則被殲於曹縣城武間，其一·三·四·六·八縱隊各殘匪，則被迫於許昌至　城之錢，國軍正由四面圍殲中。</p>
<p>豫鄂院方面之劉匪，這一週來爲了躱避國軍之搜剿，極盡其零整互變之能事，但國軍緊密配合地方團隊，四面兜剿，加以該匪至今尙未完全穿着棉服，凍餒之下，死亡過半，山區之匪已成日暮途窮。其十二縱隊爲了搶掠糧食及禦寒衣物，廿三日曾竄唐縣鎭附近，被國軍分途兜剿，廿六日仍逃回大洪山四周。其第十縱隊及陳賡匪部，在鄧縣東南及浙川趙家川漫川關等地，迭遭地方團隊與國軍之協力圍殲，已潰不成軍，刻各該殘匪分向鄖西鄖縣及鄧縣新野間地區逃竄。九縱隊一部逃竄於沙河店附近，企圖躱避殲滅厄運，但我團隊更協助國軍加緊索剿，務求澈底肅淸而後止。</p>
<p>戰果：東北戰塲本週內共斃傷匪二萬二千餘，俘匪五百五十餘名，鹵獲八二迫擊砲三門，輕重機槍三十餘挺，步槍三百三十餘支，擲彈筒三十七個，各種槍砲彈六萬發。</p>
<p>華北戰塲，本週內斃傷匪五千餘名，俘匪七十七名，步槍一百零七支，手槍三支。</p>
<p>蘇魯豫皖方面，本週共斃傷匪一萬一千餘，俘匪七百餘名，鹵獲重機槍五挺，輕機槍十三挺，步槍九十三支，手榴彈一百四十餘枚，步彈一萬九千三百發。（以上係根據各方面已報數字統計，普陝方面尙未計入）。</p>

<h3>全國民衆反對英伊新約　伊拉克內閣總辭職　英在中東防共計畫遭打擊</h3>
<p>〔路透社報達廿七日電〕伊拉克黨政伊拉，頃宣布加比爾總理所領導政府之辭職。加氏東於內閣辭職前卅六小時自英國飛往報達。國內對於英伊新約之抗議，已　趨激烈，報達街頭之示威，竟有出動機關槍者，有數人死傷。在此種情形下，在倫敦簽訂英伊新約之加比爾遂不得不宣布辭職。伊拉攝政於內閣辭職後，即向國民廣播呼籲從事合作，以避免流血。羣衆聞政府辭職之訊，多在街頭歡呼狂舞。伊下議院議長及議員三十人亦同時辭職。</p>
<p>〔路透社倫敦廿七日電〕此間對於伊拉克加比爾政府之被迫辭職，毫不掩飾其嚴重的關切。外交界且料出於一月十五”簽字面尙未經批准之英伊新約，有重新談判之可能。英政府之地位，乃為在新約獲得批准以前，英伊兩國關係當繼續按照一九三五年之英伊盟約辦理。該約有效期原定至一九五二年為止，未經雙方協議變動，自將繼續有效。</p>
<p>〔聯合社倫敦廿七日電〕政府官員今日宣稱：伊拉克內閣總辭職，乃英國在中東方面防止共產主義計劃之一大打擊。內閣辭職與報達暴動兩事，指示加比爾總理促使批准英伊友好與軍事互助條約之企圖業已結束。官方獲訊之下，深表失望。貝文外長嘗謂該約為一種「範本」，希望據以與中東各國陸續簽訂同盟，從而樹立英國與阿拉伯聯合安全體制。英國代表料將在伊拉克繼續幕後活動，支持新總理爭取人民接受該約。外約坦官員現在倫敦討論簽訂同樣條約，沙地阿拉伯官員亦允本月杪在此問開始談判，此外，英國並希望與埃及將久已停頓之修約事宜，重開談判。</p>
<p>〔聯合社倫敦廿七日電〕政府消息靈通人士今日聲稱，貝文外相巳與阿拉伯領袖開始談判中東問題，俾與阿拉伯各國商訂聯合防共安全計劃，最後料將牽涉英美兩國軍略　貝文憂盧蘇聯在中東之野心，實甚於巴勒斯坦阿猶人之爭端。貝文擬佈置一種壁壘，以防希臘游擊隊一旦獲勝因而威脅蘇葬士運河與地中海方面英美優越地位。此舉乃英外交部與美國務部共同設計之一部份。</p>
<h3>議會辯論貨幣貶值案　法揆以去就力爭　黃金自由買賣案作技術上修正</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕倫敦廿八日廣播：巴黎訊，社會黨在國民議會表決法郞貶値問題時，決放棄投票，其用意顯欲避免使許曼內閣瓦解。</p>
<p>〔路透社巴黎廿八日電〕社會黨發言人稱：許曼總理業已同意對建立黃金自由市塲之法案，作若干技術術上之修正，以使國會得以通過。</p>
<p>〔路透社巴黎廿七日電〕許曼總理今日警吿國民議會，聲言議會如果否決政府所提建立黃金自由幣市塲之法案，政府將不能繼續秉政。</p>
<p>國民議曾就該法案開始辯論前，內閣曾開會二小時又四十五分鐘，討論會曾黨內部份子對該案之反對。社會黨之反對該案決戰，係於該　國會議員組開會時成立。同時國民議會之財政委員會已以十七票對十五票拒絕該案，棄權者七票。國民議會之辯論原定下午二時開始，後因內閣開會未畢，延至十時始行開始。政府動議視該案為緊急法案，已由國民議會以三七三對一八四票通過，反對者均共黨議員。辯論一小時後，至晚十時（上海時間週三上午七時）即宣布改期至翌日下午四時繼續辯論。頃悉內閣定週三上午開開會議，由歐禮和總統親自主持，同時社曾黨國會議員組亦定週三上午再度開會，屆時財長梅逸·外長皮杜爾均將出席。據關係方面揣測，政府之建立黃金自川市塲法案，可望在國民議曾中通過，蓋社曾黨議員之反對，已在逐步平息之巾。政府是否將作若干修改，以適應社會黨職員之要求，現尙不知。在週三辯論開始以前，許曼總理將分別向社會黨人員共和黨及急進黨議員致辭，說明政府所提法案之意義。</p>
<h3>下屆聯大會　決在巴黎舉行</h3>
<p>〔路透社巴黎廿八日電〕世界日報稱：法政府發言人謂，下屆聯大已經聯合國秘書長賴依決定在巴黎舉行。</p>
<p>〔路透社普拉格廿七日電〕賴依在此表示，尋覓會址之任務已吿結束，惟目前尙不能透露決定選用何處，但瑞典比利時捷克均已表示無法供給舉行聯大之設備。</p>
<h3>聯合國朝鮮委會　靜待蘇答覆</h3>
<p>韓人陳述對選舉意見</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社漢城廿八日電〕聯合國朝鮮委會今日決定將舉行大會之日期，展至本星期五，冀能獲得蘇聯滿意之答覆，允許委員會進入北韓。</p>
<p>〔路透社成功湖廿七日電〕南韓民主委員會代表顏魯易今日發表聲明，要求聯合國承認南韓即將舉行之選票爲全國性之投票。渠指出參加此次投票之韓人，至少將佔全人口三分之二。朝鮮共國會員國後，朝鮮人民在聯合國支持下，即可與蘇聯直接交涉，以謀全國統一及解放。顏氏强調朝鮮之統一並未絕望，其成功有賴於朝鮮自山區內之迅速建立朝鮮共和國。蘇聯治下之韓人，預料必能擁獲本國政府，而不願支持外國之傀儡政府。朝鮮共和國之成立可使蘇聯明瞭韓北之交出，可與一眞正民主的國家樹立和平關係。</p>
<h3>德西部合併問題　法提備忘錄</h3>
<p>薩爾煤產將全部歸法</p>
<p>〔路透社倫敦廿七日電〕法駐英大使馬西格里，已於週六向英外部提出備忘錄，詳舉法政府對德境英美區經濟行政新措施之意見。權咸方面謂俟英外部硏究該備忘錄後，希望合併區新措施之最後計劃，得以適合法國之期望。同時合併區各邦德總理亦定明日向英美總司令　勃森及克拳擊出關於新措施之建議。</p>
<p>〔路透社華盛頓廿七日電〕據悉，英美已向歐洲煤礦機構建議，使職爾區之煤產逐步撥交法國，義爾全年煤產計一千二百萬噸，至一九四九年第二季起，全部煤產均撥交法國，不再供給德國。官方認此舉不實在事實上承認薩爾之受法國控制。蘇聯對於此點，前此固已表示拒絕承認。</p>
<h3>邱吉爾極力主張　召開三巨頭會議　覓取諒解保世界和</h3>
<p>〔合衆社倫敦廿七日電〕據接近邱吉爾方而頃談稱：邱翁希望召開一次三强圓桌會議，俾獲致世界各强國之間切合實際之協定，與蘇聯成立諒解，「向世界保蹬和平」。據稱，邱翁廿三日在下院中演說，要求與蘇　攤牌，實際上即要求如開另一次三强會議（即史達林·杜魯門及艾德禮三人會議）。據透露稱，邱翁在演說後會吿保守黨黨員稱，渠眞正所希望者，乃為與史達林議價還價之圓桌會議。此外邱翁並希望：　自史達林處獲得一決定性「是或否」之答覆，蘇聯之衛星國是否有意巾止其給予希臘遊擊隊之援助，及停止沿希臘邊境撥動不安之行動。　肯定保證國際共產情報局不擴張至東歐赤化「合法」範圍以外。　與史達林作坦白之諒解，東西兩方對彼等願意准允永久世界和平之構造，作率直之聲明。若此三項保證不能自史氏獲得，邱翁相信「某項步驟」（並未說明）應予採取。</p>
<h3>奧和約最大障礙可消除　四强將重開談判　蘇反建議四點尙待折衝</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社華盛頓廿七日電〕國務院發言人宣稱：國務部現正在研究蘇聯對奧和約之新建議，美政府將於數日內通吿三大强定期召集四强代表新會議，討論此項建議。</p>
<p>〔路透社維也納廿七日電〕奧外長格魯勃·外次華特倫納，日內將赴倫敦參加奧國和約之會談。奧政府並宣布已接獲蘇聯對於對奧條約之反建議案，業已予以審查。奧總理斐格爾表示希望對奧條約能迅速成立，以恢復奧國自由。</p>
<p>〔路透社維也納廿七日電〕西方盟國人士雖認蘇聯就奧境德產問題最近提出之建議，對於對奧條約之完成雖有進步，然尙有四點使其建議難望爲西方盟國所接受。蘇聯原來要求之德產權益價値八億元，今已减為三億五千二百萬元，包括　價値佔計連一億三千五百萬元之油權—奧境石油開採提煉探測權三分之二，有效期五十年。　航權佔價約一千七百萬元，奧國多璃河航權之百分之廿五包括下游交通之控制權。　其餘德產總値約二億元。西方盟國人士指出蘇聯此項新建議，尙有數點困難：　前述第三項之其餘德產，言明須折合可以自由兌換之貨幣總値二億美元，在兩年內由奧國償淸，此巨額美元勢必由美國供給。　移轉蘇聯之德產至移轉日為止，附着該德產之義務並不一併移轉蘇聯，此係表示奧國對德之要求將彼棄不顧。　關於德產條文之遵行發生爭執時，應由關係國直接談判解決。盟國人士指出此款之拒絕接受仲裁，使爭執難以解決。奧人意見則認蘇聯旣已同意除油權航業外，其他德產一概折價二億元付給蘇聯，而毋庸斤斤於其他德產之定義，已可使對奧條約談判中最大之障碍為之消滅。</p>
<h3>英義訂貿易協定</h3>
<p>〔路透社倫敦廿七日電〕義大利發言人稱：英義聯合經濟委會就英義貿易，舉行歷時四十天之討論後，雙方業已成立為期一年之貿易協定。會議茲已結束，廿八日即可發表聯合公報。</p>
<h3>美海陸將領　請撥欵整軍</h3>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓廿七日電〕美高級海陸軍將領數人今日出席參院軍委會陳述意見，咸謂美國如與蘇聯繼續摩擦，則議會應於下年度撥付巨款，革新陸海空軍，經費若干則並未宣布。惟據參謀總長艾森豪威及其繼任勃萊特雷稱，杜魯門總統向議會提出之下屆軍事預算為一百十億元，當再加半數。</p>
<h3>各國貓咪　雲集巴黎</h3>
<p>明舉行國際貓展覽</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社巴黎廿七日電〕第十七次國際貓展覽會，定期一月卅日由巴黎貓俱樂部主持在此開幕。全世界各種最美之貓，日來已絡繹運至此間。</p>
<h3>杜魯門總統簽署　「美國之聲」法案</h3>
<p>〔中央社會盛頓廿七日電〕杜魯門總統今日簽署「美國之聲」法案，使戰時專為報導戰况之機構之美國新聞處，在平時獲得合法組織之地位。目前在各國負責主持美國新聞處之工作人員，因新聞處所提出明年會計年度四千萬美元之預算案高出今年一倍，現正準備擴大組織。據中國方面之美新聞處人員稱，天津與昆明二地之新聞處將車行恢復，新聞處內美國及華籍辦事人員，均須略為增加。</p>
<h3>德境內美軍政府　將由國務院接管　本年七月起實行</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社華盛頓廿七日電〕德境美佔領區總司令克萊將軍與馬歇爾國務卿數度會商後，陸長羅雅爾今日公佈稱：國務部時自今年七月一日起，担負美佔領區管理之實，日代美陸軍所負之）責任。但公報　議國務院對目前之軍政府及內部人員仍擬繼續使用，且謂軍政府中之人員目前幾全部為非軍人，自七月一日起將無一名軍人在內。至於軍事佔領方面之軍事任務，則蔣繼續由軍隊處理。但朝鮮及日本之軍政府更迭，迄未有何計劃擬就。</p>
<h3>東德政治局勢　將有重要演變</h3>
<p>〔路透社柏林廿七日電〕可靠方面息：前德軍保魯斯元帥（史達林格勒之役被俘）賽特利資將軍及「自由德國民委員會」之其他領袖，日內可自蘇職重返東德，以參加蘇聯所主持「德人民大會」發動之德國總一運動。近來此間對此等將領之傳稅頗多，甚至有謂彼等已在蘇聯組成德軍，由蘇聯予以訓練者。保魯斯等返國之訊如果證實，東德政治局勢或將有要之演變。</p>
<h3>印尼新閣宣告成立</h3>
<p>〔路透社巴達維亞廿七日電〕日若電台廣播，共和國副總統哈泰，業已組成無黨派之十六人」效能內閣」，以繼於上週五辭職之夏理福廷內閣，新閣名單定週五宣布。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社日惹廿七日電〕據新她里訊，哈泰向新聞訊者宣佈，共和國內閣原有閣員卅二人新內閣將减爲十六人，　員人選尙朱能公佈，據安太拉通訊社　息，新內閣將無次長與國務員，惟將增設復興部與靑年部。</p>

<h3>消除種族歧視心理　援歐方案應該擴大　美有色民族協會秘長談稱</h3>
<p>〔路透社華盛頓廿八日電〕促進有色民族全國協會秘書長魏特，吿參院外委會，主張擴大歐洲復興計劃至亞洲，非洲及加里比安海區，並使該計劃包括最能助美國協助世界之各國在內。魏氏稱，飢　對於白人之痛苦，與對於黃色，褐色，黑色人種之痛苦相同。受援國家之有殖民地者，須予殖民地人民以自由，美國協助白種的歐洲復興，否認殖民地人民之自由實屬愚蠢。印尼，亞洲，非洲之白人優勢，已永遠彼毀，企圖重建必將引起三次大戰。</p>
<h3>陳立夫闢謠　否認對路透社會話</h3>
<p>〔中央社南京廿八日電〕中央社記者為路透社披露陳立夫氏對於烏蘭　叛亂事件之談話，特走訪陳氏，承吿路透社記者前昨兩日並未來見，其廿七日南　所引本人對此事之談話，實無根據云。</p>

<h3>北美報、聯合會版所有</h3>
<p>— 本報編譯室譯</p>
<p>踏進國務院後第一樁工作</p>
<p>當我進國務院的時候，我國政府已經在準備將在倫敦舉行的經濟會議了。由國際聯盟召集的籌備會議，已經在日內瓦舉行過，並且擬定了一個繁複的議程。為了作更進一步的準備起見，總統就邀誚和我們有重大商業關係的十一個國家，遣派代表到華盛頓來和我們討論經濟問題。</p>
<p>總統於一九三三年五月七日發表廣播演說，列舉會談的四項目標。它們是：縮减軍備；减低貿易壁壘；穩定通貨，籍使商業公司可以事先簽訂契約；在所有國家問重建友好關係和更大的信任。此外，總統和英首相麥唐納曾曾就戰債問題舉行過一次時別會議，未獲結果。</p>
<p>關於戰債談判，我很少參加。總統將該項工作托付予助理國務卿莫萊（Raymond　Moley）。我認為這個問題，牽涉財政部的方而較多，牽涉國務院的較少。此外，我相信戰債問題已經變成一頭死馬，我倒以不牽入其中過甚而引為滿意。</p>
<p>大約就在道個時候，莫萊有一天早晨到我的公寓來。他面部的表情是嚴肅的。他繼而就對我說，他並無意於佔有我國務卿的位置，和外邊所流傳的謠言相反。在他走了之後，我對另一個訪客說：「莫萊的腦筋中至少有這個念頭。」這點以後在許多方而獲得證實，而在倫敦會議時達最高潮。</p>
<p>一九三三年五月初，我在總統同意之下，訓令常時駐在倫敦的戴維（Norman　Ｄavis）向倫敦經濟會議的組織委員會建議臨時關稅停戰。共他的國家起先反對，但是最後接受了，不過附帶各種的保留和解釋。</p>
<p>五月二十。莫萊突然發表了一篇廣播演說，事前或事後都沒有和我商量過。在這篇演說中，他肯定地否認可以在倫敦會議中得到有益的收穫，就是曾議成功，也無裨益。他說國外貿易極少重要性。這篇演說，以美國政府實際立塲的形式，向美國全國廣播，和以後發給派往倫敦的美國代表團的訓令中所採取的立塲，顯屬不符。而且這篇演說又屢屢在歐洲轉播，以致損害了美國代表團的立塲，尤其是我的立塲。在這種情形之下，莫萊例應由總統加以嚴厲的訓斥，但不幸羅斯福先生有時候往往以過份的自由，給予他的密友，而沒有顧到他其他的友人。</p>
<p>直到五月底，當我率領的代表團唯備乘輪前往倫敦的時候，即將在倫敦討論的减低關稅壁壘問題，以及全國復興局和農業調節局（尤其是前者）所主張的高關稅要求之間的矛盾問題始被提出，祇不過節單地討論了一番。我對於出席倫敦會議的幾個目的，立塲堅定，其中主要的一個就是减低關稅。直到我們啓程之後在遠渡重洋時，並沒有採取過相反的行動。</p>
<p>五月三十日，總統接見除了我自己以外還有其他五個團員的代表團。總統在任命這幾個團員時，事前並沒有和我商量過。</p>
<p>羅斯福先生給我們一個備忘錄，其中說明在倫敦應該遵循的政策。他要求我們在會議中立即提出的幾項重大問題，乃是：在會議期間實行關悅停戰；為一種協調的貨幣財政政策，訂定若干一般原則；取消外匯限制；就逐步消滅人為貿易辟壘和减低關稅，獲致基本協定；同意若千種基本商品的生產和分配。我帶有概括這些題材的六抓決議案，準備在倫敦提出。</p>
<p>五月卅一日。，當我從紐約乘「羅斯福總統」號首途之時，我袋中懷有一份互惠貿易協定法案的副本，這個法案當時正在總統的辦公桌上。我預期可以把這個法案給在倫敦的其他代表團傳觀，用以證明我們為减低關稅而作的努力，是具有誠意的，並且力能做到。我希望在會議進行到相當階段時，總統可凡將該項法案向國會提出，而能獲得通過。但是事態的發展，使我無法在大會中提及，僅能作為參考而已。</p>
<p>在旅途中，我開始一種習慣，這種習慣，在以後幾年為出席各項會議而乘輪往返時，我一直予以保持—那就是在船上努力工作。我從不暈船，此點頗慶慶幸。縱使在氣候最惡劣的日子，我還是能够門讀書寫，隨心所欲。我往往沿着中板，作長時間的散步，作爲一種運動，偶而在印板上玩一次　重大球。每天，我在船上和我一起的代表和專家舉行幾次會議，並且隨時以無綫電和華盛頓保持聯繫。</p>
<p>我　想在當時對較大國家具有興趣的三個經濟問題中，我眞正能够在倫敦提出討論的祗有一個。這三個問題，就是戰債問題。立即穩定通貨問題。以及减低貿易門稅壁壘問題。戰債問題完全置之不談。穩定通貨問題是預備討論的，但僅由財政部和聯邦準備銀行的專家負責處理。此事與會議無關，不在美國代表團工你範圍之內。僅餘的一個間題，就是减低貿易壁壘問題。</p>
<p>就在那時，我在輪船上開始從華盛頓接到無綫電訊，傳來關於提高—不是减低—關稅以及實施進口限額新立法的消息，顯示總統將不以貿易協定法案向國會提出。在乘輪航行一星期之後，我於六月七日向總統發出一個無綫電報說：</p>
<p>「聽說總統將不要求國會授權政府，根據相互關稅讓步。談判互惠商業條約，由國會保留否決權，猶如國務院的法案草案所擬定的。我誠懇希望這些消息並無根據。我經過深思熟慮之後，覺得這種辦法，除了可以對我國出席倫敦經濟會議的代表團的任務發生最重大的阻碍之外，並將遷延談判此類商約的權力到一九三四年，實　重大錯誤。</p>
<p>總統回答說：「我對於你爲了在本屆中會中關於關稅問題應採取的行動而表示的焦慮，我完全理解，並表贊同。但是在國會將近閉幕的幾天，局勢是如此之緊張，致使立即休會成為必要。不然，分紅立法，紙幣膨脹等等可能被迫通過…：所以有關關稅的立法不但似乎極不相宜，並且是不可能有所成就的。</p>
<p>「你具有充份權力，可以根據相互的閱稅讓步，在倫敦談判一般性的互惠商業條約。此外，並無理由說你不能籌備在華盛頓召開會議，以與個別國家從長計議肯定的互惠協定。一俟國會重開，所有這些協定，不論是一般性的或者是兩邊性的，都可以向國會提出，要求通過。」</p>
<p>這個消息是一個可怕的打擊。它從根本上打消了我到倫敦去的基本原因之一。木來，我希望靠了這些基本要點，可以在會議中獲得眞正的結果，謀使各國—雖然是逐漸地—從世界不景氣中自拔出來。在我的立塲和總統在他電文中所倡議的意見之間，根本的異點是如此：</p>
<p>在我看來，國會必須授權政府，談判互惠貿易協定，包括减低關稅在內，並在某種限度之內，這些協定可以生效，不必經由參院核准。這一點，視來在一九三四年六月問是做到的。但是總統所建議的辦法，是在舊的基礎上談判關稅條約，意思就是說它們必須提交參院，由三分之二多數加以核准。這種辦法旣不給我帮助，也不給我鼓勵，因爲從來沒有一個美國參院，曾經核准過經由政府談判主張大事减低關我的貿易條約　。至於事前未經國曾授權而談判的貿易條約，更不必說了。</p>
<p>當我抵達倫敦的時候，其他國家的代表團已經深知美國代表團極困難的處境。總統於六月九日宣佈，說他不將以關稅立法提交國會。其他的代表團立即避免商討任何條約，因爲他們相信這會無限期的在國會中被積座起來的。</p>
<p>六月十一日，在倫敦會議開幕的前一天，總統打電報給我說：「關於减低關稅和消除貿易障礙，你不必為此間的情勢担憂。國會中為內政問題所作最後的爭論，使有關關說的一般辯論，對於我們的整個計劃成為危險。</p>
<p>「我堅決地支持你，此間所說的或做的，不會妨礙你的努力。你的政策或者我的政策沒有變更之理。並且還記着，假如我們能使條約簽字，我可以在秋季單獨召開參院的特別會議，考慮批准。」。</p>
<p>但是我在這裏沒有什麼希望。總統在口頭上支持我，但是假如我要在倫敦有所成就，我也需要用行動來支持我。</p>
<p>但是有一樁極重要的事實，不應予以忽視，就是幾乎所有的國家之間對於一種可以接受减低貿易壁壘的辦法，意見懸殊。英國正向限額制度方面走。若干金本　國家像法國，比利時，荷蘭和瑞士，在考慮减低關稅之前，要求暫時穩定通貨。其他的國家提出其他的先決條件，像戰偵救濟之類。</p>
<p>從來沒有一次會議像這次會議那樣纏繞不淸的。在大部份時間中，似乎一直在濃為由摸索。在這裏　挑撥家，煽動家，乖戾的人物，和奸刁的評論家，可以大起忙頭。</p>
<p>這種表現於倫敦會議的矛盾見解和態度，也伸展到美國代表幽中間來。美國代衣團中有主張高關稅的團員像參議員畢德曼（Rey　Pittman）等。對於穩定通貨問題，事實上對於其他一切問題意見大相逕庭。出席一個世界會議的代表團團長對於全體團員人選，竟無機會和總統事前協商—或者讓代表團人員獲有此等淸楚的印象—實屬錯誤，其不幸程度，實少有甚於此者。因爲這樣一來，若干團員就缺乏忠誠協力的意識，其他的團員竟表示公開　蔑視。　是我　經驗。</p>

<h3>參議會等四團體聯宴華北請願團　議長代表市民致關切之意</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕本市市參議會，市商會，地方協曾，工業協會四團體，昨下午六時，假招商局餐廳，聯銜設宴招待華北請願團，表示歡迎之忱。出席者除請願國代表時子周，許惠東，李燭塵，姬奧川，及東主潘議長，徐寄庼，杜月笙（軍行嚴代）吳蘊初外，到來賓吳市長，方治，吳開先，劉攻芸，楊管北，程滄波，束雲章，吳味經等約百餘人。盛會延至八時四十五分始散。</p>
<p>潘議長首先致詞，略稱：個人對請願團此行，觀感有三：　請願團此行，獲得相當成果，足見政府能瞭解人民需要與期望，考慮採納予，以施行，實為可喜可賀之現象　請願團此次若干請求，不僅為華北或平津局部之請求，亦為全國有關之請求。在京迭商貨暢其流之方策，中樞各關係部會，均能推誠洽商考慮，可見政府與人民，在經濟政策上，已充份合作，實爲國家人民之初。　上海在此艱困之局面下，尙勉能安居樂業，一須歸功於各方將士能奮勇剿匪保衛。二須歸功於前方人民（如華北）努力建設，經營生產。華北人民先上海人民受苦，上海人民深表關切。深望請願團諸先生，能將上海人民對華北關切之微意，轉吿華北人民。</p>
<p>旋市商會工業協會理事長徐寄庼及吳蘊初分別朗誦書面歡迎詞，對請願團員寒跋涉晋京，代表華北數千萬人民請命，深表欽佩。章行嚴亦代表地方協會杜理事長向請願團代表致敬。</p>

<h3>天蟾舞台盛會歡送　健僡官兵重上前綫　廿八輛車浩浩蕩蕩　沿途市民燃爆竹歡呼</h3>
<p>上海小姐王韻梅代表向壯士獻旗</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕本市各界昨假座天蟾舞台，舉行歡送健愈官兵重上前綫慰勞大會，吳市長，潘議長，方主委及師管區司令傅正模，吳淞要塞司令邵百川，空軍司令王衛民，市總工會理事長水祥　，婦女會代表陸惠民等均蒞會參加致詞，會塲情緒空前興奮，大會自上午十一時半至下午二時半始吿結束。</p>
<p>淸晨七時，即有白色吉普車一輛，上圍紅布橫額，播送「筱快樂劇團滑稽歌曲，緩緩前導，後隨廿八輛港口司令部大軍車，滿載第二〇及第一〇一後方醫院三千餘健愈官兵，排成長列，浩浩蕩蕩，從吳淞路軍之友社出發，經過四川北路，天后宮橋，北京路，西藏路，福州路，而達天蟾舞台。沿途市民，及兩旁商店，均燃放爆竹，表示崇敬之熱情，並揮手向卡車上之健愈官兵歡呼，一位第二十後方醫院傷兵千記者稱：「我有生以來，第一次被感動得流淚，當軍人不能戰死沙場，已經是恥辱，受點傷算得什麼，國家待我們太好了，老百姓更使我們感動」。</p>
<p>努力掃蕩再接再厲</p>
<p>大會由吳市長主持，除代表上海市各界，向全體健愈官兵表示敬意外，時別指出，今日中國之時局，人民不能安居樂業，是共匪所造成，希望健愈官兵重上前綫，仍本已往精神，努力掃蕩。潘議長代表全市五百萬市民歡送全體官兵，並謂：「共匪作亂，並非單純的匪患，是具有國際背景，共匪出賣國家民族，甘願做外患的先鋒，已非中國國民。上海之能安樂，全仗各位重上前綫，擊碎共匪陰謀，我們並且要用這個歡送的呼聲，喚醒醉生夢死的人們」。市黨部方主任委員說：「共匪一天不消滅，國家一天不能建設，人民一天不能安樂，巾國一天不能安定，也即是世界一天不能安寗，各位重上前錢剿匪功成，非但是巾國的民族英雄，也即是世界英雄」。</p>
<p>英雄美人絕好鏡頭</p>
<p>各界代表先後致詞畢，麥克風中報吿，「上海小姐」王韻梅代表上海市民向兩後方醫院獻旗，健愈官兵代表安寅，卓競流二人上合受旗，獻旗禮在樂聲和掌聲中完成，各報社攝影記者及中央電影塲攝影人員，紛紛攝取此一「英雄美人」鏡頭。遊藝節目中有大娃娃的大補缸；蘿苓，黃莉芳，康華，葉敏芝四小姐的歌唱，華僑張寳玉小姐的柔術，申家班的魔術，和最後名伶馬連良與張君秋合演的遊龍戲鳳平劇，先後共歷三小時餘。</p>
<h3>加强氣象測報　京總台遷滬　決合併工作</h3>

<h3>警局展開全面檢查　出門應帶身份證</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕農曆年關將屆，市警局為撲滅季節性之犯罪高潮，已定自今日起至下月九日止，實施全面性檢查。其時間次數視情形臨時決定，惟至少每日在一次以上。對象為行人·里衖·棚戶·車輛·船舶·旅館·妓院·公共塲所。據警局負責人昨吿記者稱：此時期內，希市民隨身携帶身份證，免受檢時發生麻煩</p>
<h3>文化界一大結合　美協昨舉行年會</h3>
<p>針對現實央議請加緊戰亂</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕上海美術協會昨日下午二時在乍浦路文化會堂召開第一屆年會，出席會員處文，王進珊，劉海粟，鄭午昌，賀天健，陸丹林，嚴獨鶴，施翀鵬等六百餘人。市參議曾潘議長市黨部方主委亦蒞塲參加。大會開始，首由主席虞文報吿：上海美術協會係於去年成立，一年來會員已增至五百餘人，象徵上海文化界之一大結合。過去一般人認為美術家僅須孜孜於個人藝術，不必顧及社會責任，此種思想實不盡然。蓋今日何日？叛國殃民之共黨正到處作亂，姑不論北方烽烟遍地，即離滬數十里處人民亦已不能安居樂業。設或共黨一且到滬，试問我人尙能在此開會？尙能維持最低限度生活否？故今後美術界同人應一致針對現實，於作品之內容及思想方而，不斷予共產黨以打擊·一言一動均應與戡亂建國配合，俾為國家增加力量，克服艱困局面。</p>
<p>繼請市黨部方主委致詞，方氏認爲硏究美術之目的，在於求人生社會及國家　美化。當整個社會達到美化之境時，貪汚黑暗等現象即無從發生，故希望美術界同人應盡中流砥柱之責。其次，在目前動員戡亂時期，前綫士兵浴血苦鬥，後方人士應各就崗位，或川其手，或以其口，努力於宣傳國策，以求戡平匪亂，恢復統一和平</p>
<h3>求社會安定　應提倡美術</h3>
<p>方氏詞畢，潘議長適時趕到。議長首就一般人誤以為在世界擾攘紛亂，物資生活極端困苦之時，不應侈談美術之說，痛加論斥，認為美術係人生必要之修養，人之所以網於禽獸者即在於人類有天賦愛好美術，鑑賞美術之本能。人類思想生活能達到美化之境地者，必能超脫物質環境，雖生活愈苦而作品愈仕，古今中外之例子已屢見不鮮。而今日社會之所以動亂不安，亦即由於一般人美術修養缺乏之故，因此欲求社會安定，提倡美術乃為正本淸源之辦法，深望美術界同人於個人作品上求進步之外，尙應負起啓發同胞天賦愛美心理之責任，此其一。第二，近世科學發達，已臻於天下一家之境地，然精神思想則遠為落伍。其原因端在於極端國家主義如希特勒。　索里尼，東條英磯之流，與極端階級主義如史太林之流之作祟。阻礙人類思想發展，莫此為甚。唯有我中國人之思想，所謂治國平天下者最為適合時代潮流，故希望美術界負起使命，將我人此種思想自美術方面首先發揚，使人類精神得一新的洗禮，走向世界大同之道。</p>
<p>末由上屈理事嚴獨鶴致詞，勉勵美術界同人多與社會接近，多做與社會有益的工作，使美術大衆化而平民化。</p>
<h3>宣讀兩論文　通過八提案</h3>
<p>繼即宣讀論文兩篇，一為劉獅之「現代法蘭西繪畫的硏究」，一為許士麒之「中國人物畫衰落原因」。</p>
<p>最後改選理監事，討論提案，通過：　推派代表請求吳市長提早撥款建築美術館。　組織美術訪問團訪問台灣香港。　組織美術講座以資研究擴大美術遝動。　舉辦上海美術界聯合義展，籌募美術館經費。　配合全國美術運動，上海美術協會改名為上海美術會。　以大會名義電請中央加緊動員戡亂。　上電蔣主席致敬。　上電中華全國美術會理事長張道藩致敬。最後放映國泰公司「愛情愛情」影片後散會。</p>
<h3>抽籤决如期舉行　舞業最後掙扎</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕社會局於昨日下午四時，召舞廳業同業公會理事長孫洪元到局談話，由第四處長袁文彰吿以社局為實施禁舞，定三十一日下午三時，在局抽籤決定三月底應行停業之半數舞廳，屆時希舞廳業方面亦推派代表參加。孫洪元當表示渠對參加抽籤與否尙不能決定，須待三十一日上午舞業資方及舞女職工開全體大會時討論公決。禁舞實施後對資方之影響尙小，蓋舞廳原址尙可改作電影院或商塲等用，但舞女及職工一旦失業，即後果可慮。故渠等準軒再去南京請願，圖作最後挽救。袁處長吿以地方政府對本市禁舞事已盡最大努力，此次決定於三十一日抽籤。屆時如舞廳業無代表參加，抽籤仿將如期舉行。</p>
<h3>燈泡業年獎解決　華德廠一度怠工</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕社會局年終獎金處理委員會，定於今午三時舉行第三次會議，商討該會結束事宜及未了案件之處理等問題。</p>
<p>電燈泡製造業工人年終獎金問題，經總工會理事長水祥雲與電氣業公會代表調解後已獲協議。規定發給工資廿五天，依照三十六年十二月份指數發給，又華德燈泡廊因資方祗允發給二十天，工人增一度怠工，經勸導後已恢復工作。</p>
<p>西服，時裝，縫殺，皮鞋等業職業工人年終獎金問題，前經勞資評斷曾小組會決定分向勞資雙方勸導獲取解決，昨日職工曾派代表至社會局請願，年獎處理委員會副主任委負趙班斧表示允催詢資方答覆，俾早日謀取解決。</p>
<h3>北京鞋店「餓工」　斷會派員調查</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕林森中路寳康里四卞八號北京鞋店第三工塲三十五各職工，自二十六日下午起開始「餓工」。據職工嚴稱：彼等前曾與資方商定自農曆十二月初七至三十期內，底薪三十元以上部份指數不打折扣，同時工作時間放長·現資方不予履行，經交涉無效，乃實行「餓工」。勞資評斷會昨日會派員前往調查經過，待由社會局處理。</p>
<h3>外國攜歸汽車　准許轉讓領照</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕依據中央頒佈之非常時期私人汽車限制辦法中規定，自外國携歸之汽車，無資格領服，亦無法轉售，經市府呈文行政院請酌予修正，公用局昨已接獲中央指令，決准其轉讓他人，凡售於合格車主，即可准其領照</p>
<h3>魚商五十六家聯呈　反對撤銷滬魚市場</h3>
<p>關於本市魚商公會常務現事林承忠赴京向農杯部請願，要求撤銷魚市塲一案，據魚商業公會稱，此事內幕，頗有曲折，該會會員湧源魚行等五十六家業已聯署具呈行政院及農林部陳述事實眞象，並說明林承忠此次代表魚商業公會晋京請願，所謂經第廿一次理監事會議決定，請求撤銷上海魚市塲，减輕同業痛苦一節，係林承忠個人別有企圖，致公會理事畏金楚湘因被牽制，有志莫伸，憤而辭職。且撤銷魚市塲一事，大部份理監事，均以上海魚市塲係根據政府決令所設置，會員對存廢問題，無權妄議，故力主愼重，表示異議，而林承忠赴京請願之呈文，公會方面並無　底可稽，呈文上聯署之魚行雖稱同業四十餘家，是否尙有非會負夾入，亦無法獲悉，林承忠迄未公開披露呈文內容，顯係假借　業公會名義，別有企圖，故一致予以否認云。</p>
<h3>平滬空運販毒案　初次公審十被告</h3>
<p>李劍飛口供前後有矛盾</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕平滬空運販毒，查獲嗎啡九十餘斤巨案，地院刑庭昨日首度公審，由沈天保推事訊問，因該案被吿甚多，分昨今兩天開庭。昨日提訊被吿冒充上校軍官之李劍飛·海子　·（又名買長德）·賈仁法·孔繁貞·卜隆福·丹靑·馬學義·買立志·陳輯熙·買金寳等十人。</p>

<h3>兩位熱心讀者慨捐巨款助學</h3>
<p>昨天是「讀者助學金」微募捐款的第十七天，我們獲得了新的鼓勵和兩筆龐大的捐款。有一位讀者親自來館說：「在過去幾天的申報上讀到你們為淸寒學生呼籲捐款的文字，使我深深的感動，我在小時候，因爲家貧而失學，所以我能够親身體會到失學的痛苦！現在我已經是幾家紗廠的主人，我的力量也足够帮助幾個窮苦的學生，今天我帶來五千萬元，捐作「讀者助學金」，但請你們千萬不要發表我的名字，在捐款報告中只要寫「無名氏」就行了。</p>
<p>另一位無名氏，在昨天下午二時，亦到本館來捐給「讀者功學金」六千萬元，他說：這是一位老太太壽誕親友的賀儀，因鑒於失學靑年衆多，所以將節約所得，全部捐作「助學金」。十幾天來的呼籲，總算獲致了相當的效果，在昨天一日專面，我們收到了一億一千萬元的捐款，創迭了「讀者助學金」捐款的新紀錄。但是我們希望社會上擁有資財的人士，都能效法這二位「無名氏」的慷慨行動，努力捐輸，使這個助學運動，早日達到預期的目標。</p>

<h3>雁北呼聲　古城大同縱橫</h3>
<p>〔本報北平廿日航訊〕大問雄踞雁門關外，自古為爭天下者所逐鹿，不要說兩十年前，大漠上的蒙古　騎和長城內的農業子第，早把　風血雨酒遍古城，就是降至近世，大同的得失一樣關係天下的安危，明代於長城外關大寗宣化大同三府，鎭守北疆，大寗失後右翼折損，致貽明英宗土木之變，幸左翼大同雄兵東援，才扭轉危局，明末李自成，也是先取大同，方敢問鼎京畿。抗戰時期，日軍也將大同緊扣在手，顧盼察綏。勝利後，是察綏走廉也是晋北門戶的大同，一樣飽經滄桑，日本投降之初，傅作義騎兵疾進大同，當時內長城外全劉人十二戰區。其後楚溪春啣閻餳山命率軍復員晋北，雁外十二縣遂又准予歸還太原綏署建置。到了去年八日，中共亦欲拔除此釘，貫通察綏，聚衆逾五萬，主帥凡四易，圍攻四十五日，卒因傳部馳援，大戰集寗，才解了大同之圍，其後連續發展為張垣之戰，轉變了整個華北的軍事形勢。</p>
<p>斷綫風箏</p>
<p>大同去太原四百里，自從懷仁忻縣間同蒲由斷，便孤縣雁門關外，成為太原手上的斷綫風箏，關係綏南安定的左雲右玉，都駐有張　綏署的部隊，貫通察綏的平綏綫晋北走廊各軍站，也駐有相當的部隊。</p>
<p>閻錫山爲了連擊雁北，也設立了兩個機構。軍事方面是太原綏署大同指揮部，原由楚溪春任指揮官，代表閻氏統辖雁北軍事。大同戰後勝利結束後，楚氏功成身退，飄然遠引，嗣後太原綏署才發表原任某軍軍艮的于鎭河繼任楚職。</p>
<p>政治方面，山西省府也在大同設立了晋北行署，統轄雁北的第八第十兩個專員區和河曲的第十一專員區，共十九縣。主任孟祥祉是閻氏的智囊之一，頭腦週密，長於言談，對於自己的繁難工作，頗能勝任愉快。</p>
<p>門爭氣息</p>
<p>太原的一套政治圖案，在雁北多多少少走了一點樣兒，譬如太原週圍二十五縣雷厲風行的兵農合一，便沒有泛濫到雁門關外，據說閻錫山會指示，除非人民有二分之一以上的自動請求，雁北十三縣不必舉辦兵農合一。目前晋北微兵雖多，顯然還沒超渦壯丁的半數。</p>
<p>但是，這裏一樣充溢着太原氣息，祇是不頂濃厚而已。</p>
<p>閻錫山的政風政術，也都有其晋北版，譬如目前大同正流行的口號是：軍事上反擾民，政治上反貪汚，經濟上反剝削，生活上反不平，思想上反左右傾……等等。行署主任孟祥祉吿訴記者，晋北軍政機構現正集　力量從事下面的幾件工作：　積極　集糧食，以備再度保衛大同。　加强城防工事，以補兵力之不足。　趕築公路，張　至大同的公路業已完成。　肅淸偽裝份子。　設立各級鬥爭委員會，什麼不够，鬥爭什麼，小如不守時問，大如工作麻痺……都是鬥爭的對象。自己對自己鬥爭，自己鬥別人，團體鬥爭團體。以保持政治的淸明和效率。例如：大同縣鬥爭委員會第六次討論會，對大同縣長額名顯三次不出席鬥爭委員會，亦不請假，決定提出書面鬥爭，「糾正其不進步表現，促其澈底轉變。」</p>
<p>糧食戰爭</p>
<p>晋北一萬九千人的軍糧，巳傷透了大同人的腦筋。糧部採購軍糧的發價老坐牛車，而活躍的糧食市價却永遠跨快馬。雁北軍糧上年四月至六月發下的糧價到市塲採購，要短買一萬零四百五十四包，攤到人民身上，一下就增加了一百五十億的負担。現在，又要採購軍糧了，算一算，用發價去購買，還差一個鉅大的數字。地方上懣怨着糧食部定得發價太低，發得太慢。但是第卅八兵站支部長却心要雪亮，依當時的糧價，呈請之後，糧食部沒打一點折扣而且很快的氫款撥到了，但是去採購時糧價突然跳動，就是小麥小米各半，也要平均漲上四分之一光景了，怪誰呢？</p>
<p>問題還不止於此。根據政府規定，應該給士兵吃白麵，但是雁門關外是小麥小米的家鄉，小麥只有求之察綏平津，而平津糧荒正烈，綏察也在力求軍民食糧自足，縱有鈔票，如何把它變作療飢之物，也就不太簡單了。為了多方解決糧食問題，當局動員地方武裝，日夜出擊，展開了糧食爭壽戰，據說成績頗為可觀，這一切雜糧在內，已足供軍民半年之需。</p>
<p>難民世界</p>
<p>大同一城，現在住了六個縣長。除大同縣長外，其他山陰朔縣等五個縣長都在大同城建立起流亡政府。流亡縣府門前多半掛着兩塊招牌，一塊不消說是某某縣政府。另一塊便是某某縣難民收容所。因為縣境已失，無事可做，只好收容一下難民，而實際上限於經費，又收容不起，所以那些收容所也只是允許剛來的難民在那裏略略落一下脚而巳。</p>
<p>大同是擁有十萬多人的城市，據大同縣長報吿，其中難民佔五萬人，而救濟難民的機構只有兩個，一個是救濟院，收容難民四百人，另一個是救濟分所，收容難民七十人，過去行總分署也曾給難民發放救濟品，雖不能解決問題，但現在行總取消，連那杯水軍嶄的救濟也沒有了。稟上朔風正緊，華北漲風方烈，千千萬萬無衣無食的上帝的兒女，將怎樣的自力更生去渡過漫漫的苦寒？</p>
<p>爲了難民問題，地方軍政常局胸臆裏，也交織着予盾的心情，高興的是難民的來歸表示了對政府的向心，煩惱的是自己的城市還不能控制足够的鄉村，獲得糧源，而每一口難民也　不能自　村或小城鎭揹來他們的殺倉（　定他們有）。</p>
<p>離大同並不太遠口泉煤疲，每天下午四時以後地方治安使人於混沌狀態，有名的織岡石佛，也是行人裹足，倍顯凄凉。</p>
<p>地方軍事當局都一致吿記者稱：希望中央重視大同在戰略上的地位，增撥城防工業費和改　要備，要求增加大同兵力，却在其次。有一位少將說：「我們要用增强工事和加强　備來增加大同的保衛力量！」（特派員張劍梅）</p>
<h3>楊銀根庾斃獄中　臨死供出羽黨陸小弟　已按址搜獲七九步槍七枝</h3>
<p>〔本報靑浦廿七日訊〕匪軍首要「靑松大隊指導員」兼「靑滬路南流動隊長」楊銀林，於本月中句經當局捕獲，日前庾斃獄中。據渠臨死供稱：有羽黨陸小弟家中藏有步槍七支，（住龍鳳鄉七保吊塘地方），經當局派隊按址搜索，陸匪即俯首就擒，並在其家中屋上茅草內，起出七九步槍七支，人槍刻已一併解縣。</p>
<h3>自由投票　公平競賽　南匯選敎運動一瞥</h3>
<p>〔南匯廿七日通訊〕借着這一次立法委員選舉的機會，南匯推行了一次廣泛的選舉敎育運動，道在中國縣單位的選舉中，實在是一個創舉。這件事情的經過是這樣的：過去地方上辦理選舉，往往是由經辦的鄉鎭長操縱，民衆不要說看不到選舉票，甚至於根本不知道有選舉這回事，同時，鄕鎭長因為掌握了</p>
<p>大批選票</p>
<p>待價而沽，候選人要想取得選票，就必須要向他接洽條件，這中間更產生了一種選舉掮客，奔走於候選人以及握有選票的地方官吏之間，談判接洽，鬧得烏烟瘴氣，產生許多不必要的糾紛，「選舉」變成「選災」，還談得到什麼民主？南匯地方上的進步人士，知道這是不合理的現象，決心不讓牠發生，因此展開了這一次的運動。他們要敎育候選人，使大家都能够公開競選，公平競賽，他們要敎育辦理選舉的人員，不許他們扣留選舉票，或是干涉人家的投票，他們要敎育選民，不放棄選舉權，踴躍的參加投票。</p>
<p>有了這個動機，接着他們組織一個「南匯縣選舉敎育遝動促進會」，參加的有縣黨部，縣政府敎育科，中建浦東工作站，縣銀行，浦建公司等機構。推定陳濤為委員兼總幹事，顧當擎，翁碧鮮，張克平，沈志廉，潘子平，沈夢卿等為委員。此外，在全縣的每一個鄉鎭都成立一個</p>
<p>選敎小組</p>
<p>由鄕鎭長，中心學校樣長，促進會派在各鄉的聯絡員組成。鄉的下面，各保也都成立保小組，由保長，保代表，保國民學校校長，保聯絡員組成。全縣共計有三十個鄉小組，四百九十九個保小組，參加工作的人員總數在二千五百名以上，由於這許多熱心人士的發動，經過兩個星期的努力，促進會終於受到了預期的效果。</p>
<p>促進曾成立以後，第一步工作當然是宣傳，尤其是對全縣選民廣泛而普遍的宣傳，他們組織了許多宣傳隊，各學校所組織的，鄉鎭選敎小組所組織的，和促進會本身所組織的，總數在十隊左右，分別在各地工作。他們所採用的方式，有張貼標語傳單，化裝演講，演出街頭劇等。內容和一般競選宣傳大不相同，舉例來說：他們要選民有參加</p>
<p>選舉與趣</p>
<p>和明瞭選舉手續，他們提出了下列許多標語：</p>
<p>「來一個選舉的示範！」</p>
<p>「使我們的南匯縣在全國選舉中考一個第一！」</p>
<p>「自由投票，不受任何人千涉！」</p>
<p>「假如有人干涉投票，立刻報吿監察員。」</p>
<p>對於候選人方面，他們注意公開而普遍的介紹，決不作盲目的推荐。他們提出的是：</p>
<p>「歡迎候選人，不分縣籍，公　並公平競賽。</p>
<p>「反對任何人勾結辭理選舉的人員驪姦民意」。</p>
<p>「騙能爲民織盤　利，投他一票！」</p>
<p>「當心，出賣選舉票，就是出賣自已的雙魂！」</p>
<p>同時，因為候選人王艮仲是南匯本地人，平常對地方建設事業和社曾公共福利都能够熱心効力，難免民衆對他有偶像式的崇拜，選敎促進曾方面，為了要達到</p>
<p>公平先舉　起見，不惜用標語來戳破　個偶像，他們提出了：</p>
<p>「考查王艮仲，假如他曾假公濟私，不要投他的票！」貪官汚吏欺壓人民，不要投他的票！」</p>
<p>「考查王艮仲，假如他曾向老百姓敲詐過一個錢，不要投他的票！」</p>
<p>這許多標語，隨着每一個宣傳隊員的足跡，深入到每一個鄉村。</p>
<p>街頭劇和化裝會傳的材料，和這些標語的內容相彷彿，要</p>
<p>大家投票　要大家不放棄權利，但是對於候選人的介紹，都是非常客觀，非常普遍的。就是王艮仲自已所主持的浦東地方建設公司，他們在車輛上所張貼的標語，也決沒有「請投王艮仲先生一票」的話，代替着的是全部候選人的名單，是「自由競選，公平競賽」的口號。這一次南匯選舉敎育的成就，得力於宣傳和訪問是很多的。</p>
<p>候選人在南匯的競選活動，也很普遍。吳紹澍，嚴欣淇諸氏都派有代表前來，但是這種一般所謂「拉票」，是行不通的，惟一的辦法就是贏得選民的同情，能得到選民的同情，才能得到選票，這句話在南匯是絕對正確的。</p>
<p>經過這一次選舉敎育運動的發動，投票人總數達二三二，三一三人，佔選民數的百分之九十，不能不算是一大收穫。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕國行負責人員表示：華北匯款近月來並未停止，工商各業如有正當用途者，均經分別核准。今後工商匯款，亦當斟酌情形准其匯兌。又外傳華北請願團晋京後，央行決定供給資金，以收購方式，解除華北工業及出口業之因難，國行人員對此點拒不表示意見。</p>
<p>國藥上升</p>
<p>國藥市况，邇以運費增加，外費隨增，兼以產地收價步步上升，漢口，　州等處，久乏到貨，漢市報升，申存空虛，供應失衡，市價冉冉上升。西　黨參開定成交價：魁潞四十萬，禿路三十六萬，貢路三十二萬。西棉頂　，價被帶升至三十二萬。　香產地貨稀，收辦困難，獵戶居奇，更兼台灣以及外洋，去路激增，毛香激升至二千六百萬，創空前高價。提煉剔淨，折耗浩大是以義字，全字，杜字等字號爵香，不得不隨之跟升，高至七千二百萬，據稱尙雜圖利云。</p>
<h3>棉業注意管理細則　決召開大會商討對策</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕六區棉紡公會昨召開常務理事會，席間除報吿向紗管會袁主委請願經渦外，各理事以見報載紗管會疋式公吿統購綿花實施細則及棉紗登記辦法二種，情緒頓見緊張。緣各理事以廿七日向袁主委請願，要求暫緩公布各項實施細則，蓋同業對細則內容，未悉詳情，無從準備，一旦公布施行，必致扞格難行。奈請願方過，而公吿即隨之而出，實引爲莫大之遺憾。且按綿紗登記辦法，本月廿九日起各廠綿紗，不能移動，等於凍結。處茲農歷年關，徒增各廠週轉不靈之困難，尤非所宜。討論經過，決於廿九日下午，召開臨時全體會員大會，商討同業對策云。</p>
<p>〔又訊〕六區綿紡公會各常務理事，昨下午四時許，再赴紗管會訪袁主委，重申同業意見，務請紗管會當局，能重視紗廠同業之意見，加以考慮。勿使各項實施細則公布後，無法執行。聞袁主委頗表動容，願再予考慮云。</p>
<h3>配價不動　去化呆滯　棉紗續疲軟</h3>
<p>布疋初開盤小臨收回堅</p>
<p>昨日析紗市况，紡建公司照例開紗，配價無更動，去化甚呆，客帮採胃式微，本街亦乏起色，更以紗管會舉辦登記，人心　軟，多頭斬結頗衆。迨至最後，四十二支藍鳳細紗，比上日步降三十萬，爲五千八百萬元。其餘各支粗細紗，亦均續挫三五十萬至一百萬不等。</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕中國紡建公司昨循例售紗，共售四六四件，合廿支紗六〇三件，申購單共六一張。廿支金鷄紗售價，仍爲三四七五萬元。</p>
<p>昨日棉布市况，晨開均吿盤小，以棉紗辦理登記，人心極軟，檯面拋塈亦力，龍頭細布低價見一百五十七萬元，五福低至一百廿四萬五千元，間有少數成交。嗣至十點許，聞漢口帮有候船趕裝消息，塲內買胃轉健，紗花帮亦來賣紗進布，做套買交易，浮空羣起抵補，行情又復回堅。最後十二磅各檔細布，比上日同漲四五千至一萬五六千元，嗶嘰直買價亦軋升一萬至三萬之譜，其他各布，脚地似較挺秀。</p>
<p>現棉續疲</p>
<p>昨日規棉市况轉疲，因紗布疲軟，人心不振，買戶觀望，紗廠逢低有吸，交易稍有展開，紡建仍未開價，同業交易因而沉寂。昨日成交二二〇包，關廠價做開三餘鎭五四二萬八千，漢細五三七萬四千，又棧交價做開漢細五三七萬四千，沙市五八七萬，周浦籽花一二二萬至一二三萬。</p>
<p>呢絨冷落</p>
<p>昨長樂茶會棋盤街及協大正餘諸大批發戶，呢羢交易進出均見淸閒，因本街與客帮，生意俱多落令，買方旣抱穩扎穩打實力營做，致其補進情稀售價齊多轉平。昨白邊麥而登每碼沽一百二十五萬元，本邊麥而登沽八十五萬元，同業各號早感乏味，交易淸。</p>
<h3>捲菸肥皂平穩</h3>
<p>昨日捲烟市况，初開平穩，旋聞頤中公司稅則手續尙未辦妥，派貨恐將延至下月二日，本街抵補殷切，午後交易更旺，行情步升。結果十支大英老刀兩烟比上日回漲五十萬至五十五萬元，其餘中外各烟亦均軋升。</p>
<p>日用品肥皂市面，上午因有回籠貨箭刀皂拋售，市氣軟弱。午後以銀根趨鬆，業內外進取，固本皂最後行情比上日回漲二萬五千元，箭刀軋小二萬元，祥茂牛牌亦升一·二萬。光華美麗等平穩，火柴雜牌去化較吒，軋升一·二十萬元。</p>
<h3>論暹羅僑匯問題</h3>
<p>— 徐佐人</p>
<p>歷年暹羅僑匯的數字，尙無　約為金二千餘萬元，茲將云人正式統計。去年暹羅僑匯總　年一年來暹羅僑匯數，分列於數，根據曼谷中原報之統計，后：</p>
<p>根據上表所列，我們可知去年一年來，僑匯國幣數目以去年七月份爲最多，計一千一百億元，以一月份爲最少，不過一百十一億元。折合暹幣數，則以二月份爲最多，計六千四百餘萬銖，以十二月爲最少，不過一千二百餘萬銖，（此數係半月統計，全月總數當不止此數。）從全年的僑匯數字看，國幣數目雖在逐漸增加，然以折合暹幣數字觀之，却在趨向减少，尤其八月份即由上月之五千六百餘萬銖，跌落至一千九百餘萬銖，减少幾達二倍。分析暹羅僑匯所以逐漸减少之原因，則有下列二點：</p>
<p>第一：由於國幣幣値之不安定，從上表所示，很容易看到自一月至十二月的匯價像梯形的下傾，一月與十二月跌落達四十倍，再細察其下傾速度之高，更像「走索」一般，隨時都在搖曳的狀態中。因此，在先前國幣雖然走下坡，但因僑胞愛國心切，不敢過份看淡，故跌潮每能刺激就匯的興奮，可是一次，二次，總如滔滔長江水，一去不回頭，期待的希望旣經破滅，熱情也就冷了許多，以前對初跌每每不願失之交臂者，此後已具「跌無止境」的經驗，而走上了無條件看淡的心理，僑匯的日趨减少，自係意料中的事了。</p>
<p>第二：由於僑匯的投機，因爲僑匯不能正常的由我國銀行直接駁匯國內，而大部份經由私家的批信局，更因幣値的日趨低落，引起批業付僑匯的投機，每每互相以較低之價，競爭吸收僑匯期票。觀去年一月至七月份僑匯總額約計三億二千餘萬銖，佔全年總額之四分之三，而八至十二月份僑匯合計不過九千餘萬銖；即係由於七月前僑匯投機之盛行所致。尤其是七月份所以破錄居全年第二位，就是因爲這一月是期超水準的成績，根本就是投機之風有以促成。也因爲七月份匯額之超額空前，所以嗣後各月就益顯萎靡。原因華僑的經濟能力省限，除了少數資產較　，　措絕無問題者外，能力均有着極度的限制。因爲七月　得太空，七月以後不能瞬息補足，所以不管九月十月匯價「低康」，匯額仍每况愈下了。</p>

<h3>評戰後出版的　七種敎科地圖</h3>
<p>— 劉高</p>
<p>爭奪領土常為戰爭重要原因之一，即並非因爭奪領土而發生之戰爭，亦常以領土之　讓間結束，故幾乎每次戰爭皆使地圖變色，此次世界大戰中國及其他重要參載國家國界之變動殊大，遂使戰前出版之地理書籍及地岡，皆需加以大事修改，戰後我國各書局所出之地理敎科書，多夫加修改或僅略事修改而其內容不合於戰後情形尙多於戰前原本。唯新出地圖頗冬全部重行繪製者。細閱內容，殊今人不能滿意。評者所見十六開本之中外地岡有下列七稱：</p>
<p>一，楊景雄等：中華民國最新分省圖（寰澄出版社）</p>
<p>二，金擎宇：中國地理敎科圖（大中國圖書局）</p>
<p>三，陳鐸等：中國地理敎科圖（南務）</p>
<p>四，王成組等：新中國分省岡（新中國出版社）</p>
<p>五，金擎宇：世界地理敎科岡（大中國圖書局）</p>
<p>六，邱祖謀等：新世界地圖集（新中國出版社）</p>
<p>七，陳鐸等：世界地理敎科岡（商務）</p>
<p>此外大中國岡書局尙有中國分省新聞及世界分國新圖，其內容與上列第2第5兩岡無異。又有其他書局出版之袖珍本多種皆一概從略。評者無意將各岡之細小錯誤如位置之不正確地名之誤害……等加以校對，僅指出編著體例之不妥處及較嚴重之錯誤而已。以下所言凡未特別指明何岡者皆爲各圖共有之缺點。</p>
<p>分設層色</p>
<p>自民國廿二年丁文江等之中國地圖（申報館）出版以來，以等高綫分層設鈀法繪製地圖，一時成為風尙，十餘年來我國出版之地岡多以此法繪製。唯所繪之等高綫多爲頗粗之㮨色綫，顏色頗深。凡地勢多山省份或國家，等高綫必多，於是等高綫遂成爲山地省份或國家地圖中最觸人眼目者，此等省份或國家之岡皆顯得糢糊不淸，閱讀費力，可謂一大缺點。而最早以此法繪製之丁文江等之地圖中等高綫乃是極細之黑色虛綫，無此缺點。評者意以爲旣已分憎設色，則並此細虛綫亦可雀去，因兩種不同顏色間自然已形成一綫故也。</p>
<p>村鎭地名</p>
<p>上列中國圖之各省分區至少有一部份除繪出縣城反較縣爲大之城市外又繪有村鎭甚多。中學敎科用地岡之加入縣以下小地各之風氣，似乎開始於抗戰初期。那時因戰爭新聞中常有小地名出現，一般人除查閱中學敎科用岡外，無法獲得詳細地圖，於是中學用地圖之出版者，互以其岡有小地名競爭。殊不知戰爭時因地位形勢關係，三家村亦可發生劇烈戰鬥，其地名亦可見於報紙上之頭號字大標題。看戰事新聞有時除軍　機關所密藏之最詳細地岡外皆不够用。地岡黃乎合川，其標明中學敎科用者，但繪有縣城及有特殊重要性之少數小地名已甚够用。如欲求許細亦必須版本加大，不宜小版本而無限制加人小地名，增加閱讀之困難。上列诸中國圖就繪製　組會，自以金擎宇中國地理敎科岡爲較佳，但小地名亦最多，尤以四川省圖爲　，閱讀亦特別實力，不可謂非一大缺點。</p>
<p>新的國界</p>
<p>我國戰後所出世界地圖唯一較戰前所出者爲　之處僅是　　次戰後之新國界，除國界外其他變動首未列入，殊覺增訂之處太少。蘇聯於大戰以前田十一個蘇維埃社會主義共和國台成，戰後已增至十六共和國，所增加之五共和國皆在西部。上列三種世界岡除繪有蘇聯之新國界外，仍保存一部份舊國界及爲時各共和國聞之界綫，金陳二世界圖皆取消立陶宛與東普魯十　之界綫。二圖關於此點雖不約　同，實無根據，　致錯誤。東　　士北部屬蘇聯後劃　俄羅斯共和國並不劃入立陶宛。評者以　錯誤不如遺漏三圖作者不知蘇聯之新得領土如何劃分，應知舊時各共和國間之界綫必已不正確，繪圖時將其省去可也。又俄羅斯共和國內省區之界綫亦有大變動，蘇聯城市名字新改者甚多，上列三圖皆未修改。（關於蘇　各共和國間及省區　綫　狀，非三言兩語可以說明，去年春國外新出版繪有最近國界及各國政治區劃　綫之世界地岡，去年夏初上海已有出售。）</p>
<p>自治領</p>
<p>英國於第一次世界大戰以前有五個自治殖民地（Sekf-governing　cominions），其中之一是紐　蘭（Newfoundland）。第一次大戰後不久（一九二二）愛爾蘭自由邦成立，自治殖民地增至六個。次年（一九二三）南非洲之南羅得西亞（Southern　Rhodesia）由直轄殖民地改爲自治殖民地，遂有七個自治殖民地。一九三三年紐芬䦨因財政困難請求改為直轄殖民國又只有六個自洽殖民地。至第二次世界大戰後更有增加。據　者所知二十年來所有由國出版拙理書籍及地圖籍說明皆不知加以改正，皆云英國有五個自治殖民地而其中之一是紐芬蘭，殊屬可怪。上列三種世界地圖亦未曾改正，以第一次大戰以前之情形，當做第二次大戰以後之現狀，能不令人失望？</p>
<p>詳略問題</p>
<p>我國所出版之世界圖，南美洲非洲大洋洲常較簡單，僅有全洲圖一幅。歐亞北美則除全洲岡外必有分圖。評者以爲歐亞北美有一部份小國，並不比南美非洲大洋洲各國更大更重要，其圖已於全洲岡中可見，亦可不必再有分圖。金擎宇中國岡中之全國國防圖除省界國界公路鐵路外，更無其他與國防有關之物。省國界已見於政區圖，公路鐵路已見於交通嵊。此所謂「國防圖」逐全無意義，亟應刪去以經濟篇幅，否則必須充實內容使名符其實。</p>
<p>附有說明</p>
<p>上冽七種池圖皆有五六十頁以上之說明。唯楊景雄等中華民國最新分省岡有地名索引。各學校敎學時皆另有地理敎科書，師生似甚少對地岡岡說加以閱讀者。而地理敎科書中之地名又無法加註詳細之位置，較小之地名如無地名索引，尋覓爲難。評者以爲地圖可以沒有說明，不可以沒有批名索引。</p>
<p>上列七種地圖各有優劣之處。其巾以邱祖謀等新世界地圖集，陳錕等世界地理敎科岡與王成組新中國分省圖爲較差。王成組岡出版於三十五年九月底，如評者猜測不錯，則此圖原欲於三十五年九月　各學校開學以前出版，而開始繪製過　，遂於短促之時間內匆忙趕成，故疏漏之處特多。其全國土壤圖錯誤得無　應用。其繪圖者未讀說明，撰說明與所附說明有互不一致之處。邱祖謀等新世界地岡集所繪之戰後新國界有錯誤而不完全，陳鐸等世界地理敎科岡其實並非新行繪製，僅舊地岡加上紅錢之新國界而已，亦不完全。上文已云我國戰後出版之世界地岡之唯一優點是有新國界，邱陳二圖並此僅有之優點亦無之。</p>
<p>上列四種中國圖，就整個言，皆不及戰前出版之丁文江等中國分省新岡（申報館）。上列三種世界圖亦皆不如戰前之譚廉最新世界地圖集（商務）。八年抗戰使我國多方面顯然退步，勝利後兩年餘仍未能恢復原有水準。地岡可說是其一端。</p>
<h3>介紹「中國農業的再造」</h3>
<p>— 慕蘊</p>
<p>著者：駱君　　定價：台幣二〇〇元</p>
<p>出版：台糖公司甘蔗研究所</p>
<p>著者，駱君　博士專攻甘蔗，早歲畢業於南京金陵大學後，即南返廣西從事實際農業工作，深入該省腹地，調查特產作物；並在柳城縣石碑砰以曳引機墾荒萬畝，種植甘蔗，爲吾國最早對機械化農業之大規模試驗之一，民國廿四年至我國糖業界所熟知之貴縣糖廠主持農務工作。廿七年赴美國路易斯安那州立大學深造，專門研究甘庶病理，三十年返國，迄於抗戰絡束，先後在福建農學院及廣西大學執敎。及台灣光復，乃重返蔗糖界，任台灣糖業公司甘蔗研究所所長。「中國農業的再造」爲著者數年來硏求我國農業政策的心得。</p>
<p>對於中國農業著者認爲。自給農業經營的方式必須結束。農人總還是人，農人也要過人的生活，我國自給農業社會經商品經濟破壞之後，自給的農業經營所得菲薄，農人年中所獲極徽，除非改變農家經營的方式，無法改進佔我國人口百分之八十的農人生活。這也就是說無法改進國人的生活水準。</p>
<p>中國必須成爲一個工業化的國家，自給的農家經營是工業化的障碍，它把社會生產割裂爲無數的小生產單位，而且每一生產單位的周圍都包圍着一層絕緣體，防止生產的集中，窒息工業原料低價供給的命脈。</p>
<p>農業金融正如工業經營一樣不能虧本，假如經營農業，工資也不足支付，這樣的農業誰也不願經營。自給農業經營是不計成本，不問利潤，而又效果最小的生產方式，在物物交換的自給社會中，農人以其產品，換其所無之農產，尙足自存；若以之換工業製品之日用品，則所能交換者誠無幾，這就是中國農村購買力低微的由來。吾人認爲中國當前要提高農民大衆的生活水準及增長農村的購買能力，只有一條出路，那就是改變農業經營。使無利潤可言的農業經營變爲有利潤的農業經營，這就是著者指出的企榮農經營。</p>
<p>企業農的經營，第一需要地利，第二需要技術，著者主張就地發展特產，即因利乘便，作一開端，再由政府技術人才之協助，以鞏固生產技術之基礎。俟企業繁榮，再藉企業利潤，增加研究基金，以企業盈餘改進本業生產之方法，年月愈久遠而企業愈立於不敗之地。</p>
<p>企業農業必須具備一個足可繁榮的環境，這環境的開拓與佈置是國家應負的責任。吾人認爲政府建設新企業農業應有先後緩急，及百折不撓之信心，先開發交通，以便利運輸，减低生產成本；繼之以興築埋壩，疏濬河道，保證生產之安全穩定生產量；再進而管制農產的價格喝防止農產價格之慘跌，並藉消　者分担災害之損失，使生產與消聲形成一體，俾天災人禍所加於農人之損失，可减至最低限度。</p>
<p>企業農經營的骨幹，是生產者的智識，企業農不但要有生產的技術，也需要有還銷貯　精製的常識，這種種都非文盲可以勝任。中國要發展新的農業金業，她得以萬鈞的力量，履行九年的義務敎育，使農業生產者均具有初級中學的智識程度成爲一個科學時代的農夫。</p>
<p>全書分十章，第一章，中國步入企業晨業的時代。第二章，中國晨業的改進及其陣礙。第三章，建設新農業的基本認識。第四章，中國新農業區之樹立。第五章，農業建設的推動力。第六章，新農業企業與民生工業之依靠性。第七章，企業農業的保證制度。第八章，中國農業科學化之路。第九章，政府的責任。第十章，一個戲議實例。</p>
<p>綜觀全書，議論精龍，見解獨到，對於關心中國農業前途的讀者，這是一本値得介紹的書。</p>
<h3>讀「感覺心理」後</h3>
<p>— 左任俠</p>
<p>張耀翔著　商務印書館出版　定價六圓</p>
<p>抗戰勝利以還，關於感覺心理的名著，曾獲先後拜讀者：一爲美國哈佛大學心理敎授波林氏底感覺和知覺（一九四二年初版）；二爲巴黎大學心理敎授皮耶隆氏底感覺論（一九四六年版）；三即我國心理學界耆宿張耀翔氏近著之感覺心理。波氏立論，側重於歷史的體系；皮氏底觀點；又僅注目於生理的現象。至於張氏著述，則蒐集了一切心理實驗上的事實，從事勾玄發秘；更以淺明的詞句，流暢之筆調，匯爲專集，以製後學，殊有先行介紹之必要。</p>
<p>原書共分九章。第一章爲概論：泛論感覺上的一般通性，兼涉及感覺上的分類等問題。第二章論膚覺：除討論一般通性外，兼就硬，滑，鈍，濕，黏，癢等複台感覺，各別論列之。第三章論嗅覺：此章對於嗅底偏愛和藝術等論題，俱有獨特的見解。第四章論味覺：對於味的偏愛和藝術，亦有新奇的發掘。第五章論聖覺：此章爲習音樂者不可不備之科學上的資料。第六章論祖覺：此章對色彩的學理，和色彩藝術上的欣賞心理，論述綦詳，尤爲習　事者所應人手一編之佳作。第七章論動覺：此地除一般性的討論外，對努力，磨擦，移動，方向等複覺，亦有所論列。第八章論內官覺：於一般性的論列外，復對反胃，疝痛，生產，性覺等均予以合理的解說。第九章論動物的感覺：此章乃國內心規文獻中最感缺乏的一章，深慶著者於此作了一個興味盎然的補白。</p>
<p>就全書而論，其特徵可以値得特別指出者，約有下列敎點：</p>
<p>一般心理著述，每侮偏重原則，忽略事實，而此書首重心理上的具體事實，期與原則相對立，所以歷被世人稱道的一些「某氏定律，某氏原則」，每多未邀育睞，備選列入。</p>
<p>本書論列感覺，不僅及於人類，甚至動物的感覺，亦有專章論述；這對於動物心理研究尙感冷落的我國心理界，未始不是一貼興奮劑。</p>
<p>國內出版的心理著述，多因生呑外人寫作，未經融化之故，其文字嘗不能暢達其意，致今讀者時增厭倦之感。本書作者却能以流暢之筆調，達出高深之涵義，使得讀者不感科學之枯燥，僅興文藝之欣賞。</p>
<p>我國心理學界，大都僅了解泊來的心理學；而國學內所蘊蓄的心理學智織，則從未經人問津。本書作者學貫中西，故其撰著每多引徵廣博。明人高濂之論香，淸鄭復光之論色，皆係作者所開發之賓例云。</p>
<p>張氏成覺心理爲其計畫中心理學集成之一部，其中緒論，感覺，情緒诸篇，均已陸續分部出版，餘者亦待付梓。按世界各國像「集成」這類心理學鉅製，均屬多數心理學家分担撰述者。獨自撰寫「集成」的雄岡，除芮波Ribot外，如張氏者尙屬罕觀。</p>
<p>最後，筆者原擬說幾句批評的話，以收求全責備之效，但偶又念及有犯「小駡即大捧」之嫌；且本書眞價，事實俱在，用不着多事曉舌，倒不如就此擱筆罷。</p>
<h3>翻譯舉例</h3>
<p>— 中浣</p>
<p>（蘇兆龍編　競文書局版）</p>
<p>競文書局對於英文書籍的出版，確是盡了十分的努力，它所出的書大都是適合中學生用的。分硏究用和實用兩種，而是「讀物與參考書並重」。像這一本「翻譯舉例」就是一本很好的參考書。</p>
<p>翻譯舉例的作者蘇兆龍先生的翻譯工作素爲大家所欽佩。以蘇先生這樣的翻譯家來寫這本小小的「翻譯舉例」，我們可知這是一本好書，本書曾經葛傳榮先生的校閱和改錯。</p>
<p>本書分爲英譯漢和漢譯英二大類來硏究，共分四部：第一部和第二部包括「語句翻譯」的例子，第一部是英譯漢，第二部是漢譯英。每一個例句都有兩個或兩個以上的譯法，使學者能够活用，每十個例句附一個練習，共計一百二十個例句，十二個練習；第三第四兩部包括「篇段翻譯」的例句，第三部是英譯漢，第四部是漢譯英。每一段後面都附有評語，優者說明其優點，劣者加以改正，使學者在未讀譯文之先可自行試譯，然後和評文對比，進步更快。共計六十篇，每五篇附一個練習。至於題材大都是歐美名著以及三國志，今古奇觀諸書中擇來，頗能引起興味。</p>
<p>翻譯是溝通東西文化的工具，在英文中是最重要而最困難的一部分，而關於翻譯方面的參考書一向很少，這一次筆者幸而尋得這本翻譯舉例特爲介紹。</p>
<h3>文通英語初階</h3>
<p>— 葛承訓</p>
<p>The　Wen　Tung　English　Course　Ｐrimer　上下兩册，陸殿揚編，卅六年二月文通書局初版。</p>
<p>這是一部淺近的英語課本，正它的名稱所指，專供初學英語者之用。最淺近的英語敎材最難編撰，非對於英語文有極深造詣而對於英語敎學又有極富經驗的人，不易編得適於敎學，這是一般敎師所公認的事賓。</p>
<p>初小國語，每課只有幾個字，看來極其容易，而眞正編得好的課本，寥寥無幾。因為用字愈少，需要編撰的技術愈高。一般人往往眼高手低，只能批評，不能自己動手編寫。國語課本尙且如此，初學的英語課本可想而知。所以數十年來，坊間很少有優良的初級英語課本出版。</p>
<p>英·美對於本國兒童所用的課本，往往在第一册以前尙有所謂Primer　PrePrimer的　印，岡多字少，使兒童在正式學習語文以前，得有適當的準備。英國著名的The　Oxford　English　Couroe有Primer一册，美国以九四五年出版的Learning　to　Read有Pre-primer　1-Bill　and　Ｓusen及Pre-primer2-Under　the　Ｔree兩册。其餘各書大都如此。</p>
<p>文通英語初階是一部Primer，它的編制很像英國的竹風，比較嚴正。用作小學英語課本，極爲適合。我國小學兒童在地方需要時，原得選習英語。聽說敎育部最近修訂而尙未公布的小學課程標準，也准許各地如有需要，得選習外國語。上海廣州等處小學兒童向來有英語的選修，適於初級敎學的英語課本，實在很感需要。</p>
<p>照學習心理講，學習外國語時，兒童年齡愈小愈佳。年齡太大了，反而不易成功。初級中學內年齡大的學生英語成績往往不如年齡小的學生，是很普遍而顯著的情形。原來語言不是一種知識學科，而是一種技能，如同打字·彈琴·游泳·擊球等藝術一樣，必須經過無數次的反復學習，始能運用純熟而自然。這種反復練習，行之於幼年兒童，最爲有效。年齡愈大愈喜應用理智，比較研究，就不肯像幼童們再三模仿反復練習。這於學習外國語最爲不利。所以小學兒童選習英語，如果敎師好，敎材好，極易成功。並且亳不妨礙其他學科的學習。</p>
<p>說到教材，一般小學採用初中英語課本。初巾學生的身心發展，異於小學兒童。初中英語的進程很快，內容趣味也不適合於小學兒童。有些小學採用外國小學的踝本，可是外國兒童的生活習慣，中國兒童看來究屬隔膜不通。雖有好敎師，而缺乏好敎材，敎學成續終於不能顯著。</p>
<p>文通英語初階，論其程度，適合於小學五，六年級；十歲以上兒童學習起來，一定感覺便易。學了初階，可以奠定英語基礎，將來進而學習初中英語，更可收事半功倍之効。</p>
<p>全書編選，極費匠心。兩册四十課，生字約及一百五十，上册僅有六十四字，下册僅有八十五字，限制極嚴，反復極多，極合語言學習心理。每碟除課文以外，上册有聽，說等練習，下册有命令，問答等練習。反復變化，使成習慣；每册更有寫的練習，從簡單的筆劃到熟習的字句，照科學方法排列。每四課或六課成一單元，內容貫通。單元之後，列有各種測驗；有選擇，塡充，默聽，問答，是非等流，多用圖畫表示，可以增加興趣。採用此書，敎學情態必極活潑。</p>
<p>我最愛讀它的踝文，課文演進，自然生動，所用語句都是日常生活所應用到的。這種課文在五十個兒童一班的班級內敎學，並不感覺困難。我知道上海很多小學的敎師正在選擇一種好的英語課本，給他們的兒童學習上的便利，所以樂於介紹這部文通英語　階。</p>
<p>文通英語初階的編者陸殿揚先生，歷任國立東南大學，國立浙江大學英語敎授，訓練英語敎師，對於英語敎學極富硏究，著作很多，想爲讀者所深知。復員以後，感到上海小學選修英文沒有適當敎材的痛苦，所以編撰此書，以應需要。他編此書，仍用令力，這是可以從全害的　構上，組織上，字彙上看到的。</p>
<p>這部書有個美中不足的地方，全書兩册掙圖都是黑色，對於　　愛好上不免减色。如果這部文通英語初階跟美國的Learningto　Read同樣的全部彩圖，更是令人不忍釋手，我們希望在物質產件可能範　內，印刷技術上逐　加以改進，文通英語初階成　國內最完美的一部英語課本。</p>
<h3>一個審判官的故事</h3>
<p>— 邵洵美</p>
<p>書名：The　Judge's　Story　p.218　作者：Charles　Morgan　出版：Macmillan　＆　Co　　London價格：七仙令六便士</p>
<p>却利·毛根Charles　Morgan　在英國文壇上，的確佔據着一個特殊的地位。他一共出版過五部小說，而英國三個最重要的文學獎，竟然都讓　獲得了。他每次發表一部作品，總會引起大家嚴重的注意，銷路相當好，却常有人感覺讀夾費力，可是誰都認承他是英國當代第一流作家。</p>
<p>原來自從一九三一年喬治摩亞Geore　Moore逝世，他那「散文大師』與「請故事大師」兩個頭銜，有許多作家想來　承。最有可能的要推蘇亂　脫·毛姆Somerset　Maugham。他的聲望，地位與成績，已經由全世界公認了，不過依舊有人批評他不够嚴肅。還有阿爾特斯·黑胥里Aldous　Huxley，可惜他對哲學，政治與宗敎的興趣，和文學一般濃厚：他的小說，尤其是近幾年來的作品，便每會使你有一種紊亂複雜的感覺。此外還有兩個競賽人，乃是喬治摩亞正統的門徒。一個是台維德·迦奈特David　Garnett，一個便是毛根。</p>
<p>迦余轉好像年紀最輕，他平期的一部小說：「夫人變狐狸」，同時得到兩個文學獎。文壇上鄰對他　着極大的希望。但是他後來的作品，爲了過分要發揮他請故事的天才，將最簡單的題材，煊染得複雜生動；因爲根本故事太平凡，於是臨到結局，終使讀者感到精神白費，似乎用足了心思得不到酬報。</p>
<p>我們都知道，喬治摩亞的文筆風格，已到了出神入化的境界，純潔很像個天使，生動得像股泉流，雖然經過多次的推敲與修飾，可是自然得不着絲亳痕跡。他又懂得如何去選擇題材來配令他的筆決，他的關於愛爾蘭文學運動諸　將的回憶錄，便成爲英國文環一座永久的紀功碑。</p>
<p>毛根講述的大半是現代的故事。文筆受到喬治摩亞的影響太深，而且有故意賣弄的嫌疑。這現象在「史巴根勃洛克」裹最顯著，所以這部小說也最失敗。他自己當然也明白這種作風的癡愚，崇拜英雄不一定要於棄自己的個性。一九四一年出版的「旅行」便逐漸從這條路上走開去。最近出版的「審判官的故事」，可以說，完全是他自己的風格了。</p>
<p>「審判官的故事」篇幅不長，全書不過二百十八頁，但是精緻得像一首濟Keats的十四行首Sonnet。這故事有一個整個的哲學，一個完美的結構；人物的性格都活躍在眞實的背景前面；而簡潔親切的文筆復適當地配合喬故事進展的速率。這是一部典型的英國作品。因爲祗有他們有那種悠閒的豐度，嚴謹的性情與堅靱的意志。這部作品並不希望換版大量的美金，而是在努力爭取不朽的地位。這部小說，正同該書題名所啟示，是敍述一個退休的審判官的故事。他有一個純正的人格，或是完美的心靈。他辭職以後，便過着廉潔與正常的生活。他計劃著作一部「雖典人」的生活歷史，大部的時間便用在收集與整理材料上面。和他對立的是一位大富的實業巨舉，他簡直無人格或心靈可言，所以他便以破壞人家的人格或心靈爲滿足。他要誘害那種所謂「好人」去墮落，再盡力把他們從陷阱中救出來，使他們在感激他的心理中重又生存，完全服從他的指揮與排佈。這是一種聖經裏魔鬼式的身份。審判官有一個養女。她聰明又美麗。可是她因爲過分活躍，於是好像有了一個以上的人格或心靈；依着環境與情感的驅使，隨時會改變性質與色素。假使沒有審判官的提示與應動，她幾乎會議那位實業家來把握住握的靈魂。她的丈夫也還是個「好人」。也有人格或心靈，可是都不够明顯，也不够完整。實業家並不覺得他値得誘害，除了他可能在他　子身上發生相當的影響。這幾種不同的人格與　　便是這篇故本的骨幹。</p>
<p>總之，這部小說，在近世商業州影喜極普遍的出版界裏，確屬　觀。可是我總以為哲學與心理學的氣　　是太重。假使變了毛姆，他一　讓故事　進展來解釋一切，完全避免枯燥的討論與分析。</p>

<h3>知識份子之路</h3>
<p>— 靖文</p>
<p>從前　稱爲士大夫階級，現在被稱爲知識份子的一批人，可說是現代社會由最處境痛苦的了，前人謊笑士大夫有一句話，呌做「秀才造反三年不成」，時至今日，「百無一用是書生」，也早已成了一切知識份子命運　註脚。</p>
<p>不過一個沒有知識份子的社會畢竟是不能想像的。尤其是在現代社會中，知識份子四字平不限於所謂讀書人，凡屬於中等社會階層的人，多可以說是知識份子。歐美人所稱的白領階級，我們所稱的薪水階級，以及所謂自由職業者，都是知識階級的中堅份子。</p>
<p>自有人主張階級鬥爭之說以來，有一部人即不相信我們這世界上有所謂中等社會階層存在的可能，以爲除了資產階級與無產階級之外，便沒有其他的社會階層。雖然其間有一個所謂小資產階級，但它的地位是不確定的，它可能是資產階級的「淸客」，也可能是無產產階級的「同路人」。</p>
<p>這種說法，粗粗看來好像有幾分道理，因爲所謂小資產階級者，確有許多或左或右的「帮閒」人物。但我們却不能因此而否認一個主要的事實，即中等社會階層有其獨立的存在勢力與力量，而且是一切形式的社會領導力量。不論一國或一社會的經濟生活是採取怎樣的制度，而由層社會階層的存在，始終起着領袖羣倫的作用。</p>
<p>這並不是誇大的說法，講到資本主義國家，英美當然是個中代表，但構成英美國家社會的棟樑者，決非是少數的資本家，而是佔着絕對多數的巾層階級人士。勞工階級在英美社會中若就人數講，自然是居於首位，但他們的精神嚮往中心，却仍舊是在中層階級社會。</p>
<p>蘇聯是第一個實騐所謂無產階級革命的國家，但構成今天蘇聯社會中堅的，仍不出是以知識份子爲領導中心的中問社會層。而且蘇聯的建國方針，究其極，也無非想建立一個以小資產階層份子爲其普遍基礎的國家。所謂無產產階級專政云云，不過是一部份知識份子所憑以號召的一種政治手段罷了。試問馬克斯，列寗，甚至史太林，又那一個是眞正的所謂無產者出身？</p>
<p>在我國的情形又何嘗不然，許多人雖然看不起一件長衫，但旣穿長衫的，又有幾個人肯毅然脫下？而尙未穿長衫的，又那一個不在暗暗巴望自己或自己的子弟披上一件長衫的身份？許多胼手胝足者流，平時節衣縮食，難道他的希望僅在身後四塊板嗎？決不是，他是想用他的一雙赤手向社會的上曆爬，而在他心目中的所謂上流社會，正就是現在人人鄙視的以知識份子爲社會中堅的由曆社層階級，其表徵就是一件長衫。</p>
<p>所謂秀才造反三年不成，也許可以用來議諷一部份的「讀書官人」，但絕不能適用於廣汎的知識階級層。試問古今中外歷史上那一件大運動不是出於知識階級人士的推動與領導？而現代社會的安定勢力，更捨知識階級莫屬。</p>
<p>這篇短文的目的並不是想呼籲「救濟知識份子」。知識份子旣是領導社會的中堅力量，便無需呼籲救濟。現代各國的中曆社會人士，雖備受生活的重壓打擊，不過呼籲旣無對象，也不能有甚麼效果。知識份子今日或將來的出路，不在　左或附右，而在其能堅定本身是社會中流砥柱的自信心，一秉社會正義的信念，以成鞏固亂世社會的安中勢力。</p>
<h3>寒假</h3>
<p>— 芒</p>
<p>幼年的每一篇作文上大概都有「光陰如箭」幾個字，不但我一個人如此，很多同學都喜用這幾個字開首，好像少了這句子就不成其爲好作文。其實，那時的光陰並不如箭，只嫌日子過得慢，巴不到今天過了年初一，再過一些時就是臘月底，爲的是過年時最快樂。</p>
<p>現在却不同了，反而覺得日子過得太快。淸楚地記得開學時來校的情形，現在又是放假的時候了。或許還有許多人以爲這幾個月過得慢，我反嫌這幾個月的日子渦得太快，現在的我才配得上用「光陰如箭」這幾個字。</p>
<p>同學們都希望寒假早日到來，好回家去過年。我只討厭有這寒假。不過證是本學期才有的感想，以前我也是對寒假有強烈的希求的。</p>
<p>也許我太自私了，以爲自己不好回家過年，便不希望放寒假。這是眞的，我希望沒有寒假，因爲寒假給我的不是快樂，是憂愁。愁義下學期的學費，　費，膳費……。</p>
<p>寒假又給我苦惱。回到家（其實並不是自己的家裏，）要看到父親的憂愁的而孔，要聽到母親的悲傷的嘆息聲。憂愁的面孔，悲傷的嘆息聲呵！何時才能變成欣喜的笑容，快樂的歡聲？</p>
<p>走出校門，我暗暗悲傷着。走了一程，我還時常回頭看看整齊的授舍，我捨不得離開它，因為我不知道一個月後我能不能再和它在一起。</p>
<p>寒假是多麼討厭啊！</p>
<h3>棋逢敵手</h3>
<p>— 雷紅</p>
<p>有一敎友派商人，在舊日帆船運貨時代載了一船貨物運銷外埠，好久沒有得到抵埠消息，以爲失事了。商人過到了另外一個也是敎友派的朋友瓊斯，業保險，他請瓊斯保船舶險，情願付給高價保費。</p>
<p>保險商想了一會，同商人講，「朋友，請你把詳情寫好，讓我帶回去考慮一夜，明天給你回音。」商人就寫好一張單據給他而別。</p>
<p>那晚上商人得到惡耗，這艘載貨帆船果眞失事。不知道瓊斯已經決定接受這筆保險生意沒有？他轉了一夜的念頭。如其巳在單據上簽字，就可獲得保險賠款—沒有簽呢，什麼都完了。</p>
<p>於是明天一淸早，他寫了一個便條，差人送到保險商處，略稱：「瓊斯吾兄大鑒：弟已獲悉帆船平安，昨面懇之事，如未簽定，祈將單據交來人帶回可也。」</p>
<p>保險商以爲船隻安全，爲亟於收取鉅額保險費起見，趕快簽好保險單，交給信差帶回去。</p>
<h3>論「官不修衙」</h3>
<p>— 茂公</p>
<p>據胡適之言，熊秉三生前反對「官不修衙」，因其無建設思想。姑不論舊時官吏之不修衙門是否眞個即爲無建設心的表現，據我呆想，則無論如何，不修衙之官總勝於修衙之官。</p>
<p>理由實亦簡單。夫官之修衙，目的未必在於所謂建設，猶官之坐汽車，並非爲的便利交通。若有冒失鬼記者往訪修衙之官，叩詢「貴衙門何以要修？」其最冠冕的答覆恐亦無過於「以壯觀瞻」。以壯觀瞻當然不是建設，不是建設當然不値得贊成或擁護，不，不，因其欲壯觀瞻，實在應予反對。</p>
<p>什麼呌作壯觀瞻？還不就是擺闊氣或裝神氣。在皇帝時代，做皇帝的宮呀殿呀造得宏巍壯麗，美奐美輪，其意除岡一己享受之外，即在以壯觀瞻，也就是說嚇嚇老百姓，某皇之建阿房宮，某帝之造頤和園，誰說是爲建設。像頤和園的建設費用，倒是挪用建設海軍經費者。不過在帝皇時代朕即國家，他們愛怎麼辦就怎麼辦，爾我小民有甚話說。</p>
<p>可怪的是民主國家的人民公僕也頗好宮室。以最民主的美國來說，大總統儘有小本屋中生長的平民來做，總統辦公處却須壯麗的白宮（當然，宮字是我們的譯文，咎不在彼）。我們大概都用過僕人，或總有一天要用，幾會把家中最好的房間供僕人們住宿。美國的情形我不十分淸楚，但說杜魯門先生的臥室書房必較僕人的精　，一定不會說錯。現在的民主國家的人民無不鬧房荒，活動房子　，水上住宅囉，花樣再多也露宿有人，而他們的僕八呢，却是白宮呀，黑宮呀，堂昌舒服得很。說這是民主國家，八民世紀，欺人乎，欺狗乎？</p>
<p>你也許說公僕與私僕不同，公僕是安社會治國家平天下者，不能不好好供奉，否則因物質上不舒服而精神上受影響，把國事弄糟了一點，爲禍可塗炭生靈的。我說也不然。第一私僕於我們之重要，不下於公僕。我們呌廚子睡灶披間，不怕他生活欠佳精神不好因而把砒霜當味之素放麼？第二公僕之辦事認眞與否，存心福國利民與否，與住高堂大厦與否無關，不，不，要住好房子的公僕一定比不耍住好房子的公僕辦事認不眞，存心欠濟世。公僕之上任，不比娘姨之上人家爲的賺錢，大都志在出人民於水火，不像舊小說上所謂「千里做官只爲財」的，故對於飲食起居，照理不求甚好。若有公僕非十八曆廿七層大厦不肯到差，你想他視事之後會有什麼政績？</p>
<p>即使退一步說衙門之大之美是人民的孝敬，並非官吏之所造罷，我想人民公僕的他們這時候也理應力辭，說：全國人民有多少沒有容身之處，兄弟在這樣大的衙門裏辦公實在覺得不安，故在人民至少各有蝸居之前，兄弟一定在露天辦公……</p>
<h3>長生殿疑案</h3>
<p>— 王百里</p>
<p>長生殿傳奇，在康熙丁卯（按即康熙二十六年）國忌日演奏，多人得罪，此點如吳梅顧曲塵談與王東溆柳南筆記以及阮吾山茶餘客話等書，記載皆同，自無可疑。惟國忌日演奏，止是被劾的大題目，其實骨子裏還有細節的文章存在，這骨子裏的文章，各家記載不一，茲爲便於檢討起見，將兩節不同的記載，照錄於下，以作參考。</p>
<p>柳南隨筆載：「康熙丁卯戊辰間，京師梨園子弟，以內聚班爲第一，時錢唐洪太學昉思（　）著長生殿傳奇初成，授內聚班演之，聖祖覽之稱善，賜優人白金二十兩，且向諸親王稱之，於是諸親王及閣部大臣，凡有宴會，必演此劇，而　頭之實，其數悉如御賜，先後所獲殆不貲，內聚班優人因吿於洪日：「賴君新製，吾輩獲賞賜多矣，請開筵爲君壽，而即演是劇以侑觴，凡君所交游，當延之俱來。」乃擇日治具，大會於生公園，名流之在都下者，悉為羅致，而不及吾邑（按即常熱）趙星瞻（徴介），時趙館給諫王某所，乃言於王，促之入奏，謂是日係皇太后忌辰，設宴張樂，爲大不敬，請按律治罪。上覽其奏，命下刑部獄，凡士大夫及諸生，除名者幾五十人，益都趙贊善伸符（執信）海寗查太學夏重（嗣璉），其最著者也，後查以改名愼行登第，而趙廢置終其身。」</p>
<p>茶餘客話載：「趙秋谷執信，以丁卯國喪，赴洪昉思寓，觀長生殿劇，被黃給事大鴻劾罷，時徐勝力編修嘉炎亦與讌，對簿時賂聚和班優人，詭稱未與得免都人有口號云「國服雖除未滿喪，如何便入戲文場？自家原有三分錯，莫把彈章怨老黃。秋谷才華逈絕籌，少年科第儘風流；可憐一齣長生殿，斷送功名到白頭！周王廟祝本輕浮，也向長生殿裹遊；抖數香金求脫網，聚和班裏製行頭。」徐鑒頤修髯，有周這士之稱，後官學士。聞黃給事由知縣行取入京，以土物並詩稿，遍贈諸名士，至秋谷，答以柬云：「土物拜登，大稿璧謝」。黃恨之刺骨，故有是劾。」</p>
<p>綜上所載，非獨提出彈劾之給事姓氏「王」與「黃」不同，（以下暫均作黃）即其演劇之地點，一在生公園，一在洪昉思寓，班名一爲「內聚」，一爲「聚和」，亦皆不一，尤其被劾對象，一爲趙星瞻因請客無分而心中不快，促黃入奏，一因黃大鴻以秋谷「大稿　謝」之侮辱而懷恨，更大有出入。按之常情，似以茶餘客話所載爲近：因秋谷之「大稿璧謝」，黃認爲藐視太甚，故恨之刺骨，此乃黃本身之事，若趙星瞻之促，則在黃僅爲皮膚之病，必不至痛澈肺腑。然黃雖恨秋谷刺骨，但秋谷究是被請的看客之一，不是發動的演劇之主，以恨一被請的看客，而牽累到全塲的名流，其心雖恨，似亦不忍下此辣手。余意或係趙星瞻懷恨而言於黃，黃適因秋谷在塲，觸動舊恨，無巧不成書，於是便借以消恨了。但此係余臆測之詞，未可遞信，姑置之，以待博學之士考證。</p>

<h3>河陽豬從和惠山泉</h3>
<p>— 譚正璧</p>
<p>聽慣了「月亮也是外國的好」，不禁使我想起兩樁故事來，不但無獨有偶，而且古今一轍。</p>
<p>一樁是宋朝大文學家蘇東坡的事情，載潘長吉所輯「宋稗類鈔」卷七，記東坡自述所歷：「余昔在歧下，聞河陽豬肉甚美，使人往市之。使者醉，豬夜逸去，貿他豬以償。客皆大詫，以爲非他產所及。旣而事敗，客皆大漸。「守稗類鈔是部纂輯的書，都採自宋人筆記，這一段記載當然也是從宋人筆記裏採擷來的。但今人丁傳靖所輯「宋人軼事彙編」亦引此條，即採自宋稗類鈔，可見原出何書，在現在已是不易查出的了。</p>
<p>一樁是明朝麻城人丘長孺的事情，見袁宏道袁中郞集「識張幼於惠泉詩後」一文中，說是：「余友麻城丘長孺，東遊吳會，載惠山泉三十　。之　風，長孺先歸，命僕輩擔回。僕輩惡其重也，隨傾於江；至倒灌河，始取山泉水盈之。長孺不知，矜重甚。次日，即邀城中諸好事嘗水。諸好事如期皆來，團坐斋中，甚有喜色。出尊，取磁甌，盛少許，遞相議，然後飲之。嗅玩經時，始細嚼下，喉中汩汩有聲，乃相視而歎曰：「美哉！水也。非長孺高興，吾輩此生何緣，得飲此水？」皆歎羨不置而去。半月後，諸僕相爭，互發其私事。長孺大恚，逐其僕。諸好事之飲水者聞之，她歎而已。「中郞的散文以幽默著稱，這段文字尤足爲其代表，寫諸好事飲水時認眞情形，淋漓盡致，頗具千鈞之力，等到後來事發，長孺大恚，而諸客媿歎，讀者讀到這裏，誰都不禁要爲之　然失笑。</p>
<p>共實讀者儘可不必失笑，世界上和這同類的事情眞多著，你眞笑不盡許多。月亮是外國的好早已成爲大衆的口頭禪，連貨幣也是外國的好，銀行也是外國的好，所以美金票的價儘管在高上去，而外國銀行裏的中國存款也只有增加而不見匯回本國來。就拿我們本行來說，同樣一句話，如果出於一位被捧爲權威者的口頭或筆下，不都認爲金科玉律，誰也不能加以非議反對嗎？</p>
<p>然而河陽豬肉和惠山泉，在沒有辨別力的人的嘴裏果然眞偽莫辨，然而在實際上多少有些和普通不同的地方，而現代人的外國的什麼都好，權威者的什麼都對，這個所謂「好」和「對」，却大可研究，究竟如何，還是要看下回分解，現在却還不能就下定論。</p>
<p>多年前，我曾經把袁宏道那篇文章編入一本給中學生讀的「國文選本」裏，下文有「此事正與東坡河陽美豬肉事相類」一語，當時因沒有查出「河陽豬肉」的典故，所以全部書中獨有這個典故沒有注出。後來有一位細心的讀者專誠寫信來問我，我就老實吿訴他，且許他查得後必定奉吿，誰知等到查得時，我已把他的通信處遺失，使我一時無法吿知，很是悵悵！現在附記在這裏，權當給我那部國文選本的一般讀者們一封公開的信，而且順便寫出了如上的一些感想。</p>
<h3>掘藏</h3>
<p>— 銅駝</p>
<p>美國有一種發掘古寳的團體，任何人都可以做這件事，只要有兩套園藝用具，無盡的樂觀主義——還有一塊可以發掘的地方。美國古物處關於藏　地點，業已有紀錄的，有幾百處之多。其中包括海盜蓄藏，沉沒的珍寶船隻，隱匿的寶藏。據說搜求現成財富「眞正是一種興盛的美國工業。」單是搜尋亞利崇那一個無稽的礦藏，來自世界各地的掘寳者就不下七千人。</p>
<p>一九一一年，梅麗達號郵船在却爾斯角海外撞沉，船上有金條銀磚，還有墨西哥廢皇馬克斯密林皇冠上的寳石。有落克斐勒和畢特爾二入取得發掘權，着手找尋沉舟。結果一無所獲，反而耗費了五十萬元。但這種紀錄並未使掘寳者喪失銳氣，唯一的理由是有豐富的「成功史」來鼓勵他們。</p>
<p>有波斯登的作家兼照相家斯諾其人者，搜尋隱藏的珍寳，已有二十年歷史，但是一無所成。戰前聽到一個水手名約翰的講起一個故事：一百年之前，波斯登城來了一個神秘人物，找到一個管家的職業。據碼頭上蜚揚流言，神秘的管家當過海盜。那人後來在一八八二年逝世，並沒有洩露他的秘密。二十年後，有一個自稱是海盜的兄弟，吿訴水手約翰，確定海盜有一幅地圖埋在大勃羅斯德島上，根據這幅地岡，可以找到一箱財富的隱藏之處。</p>
<p>四十五年之後的現在，斯諾知道了這故事，便到勃羅斯德島去找尋。地圖雖未發現，果然在一艘破船中找到一本密碼，知道海盜的掠獲物是在「褲袋角」外的強島上。</p>
<p>斯諾趕到那邊，帶有必要配備，如鐵鏟，對於金屬物有敏感性的測驗器等。掘了第六處，聽到鐵　碰到金屬箱的聲音。他們　到一雙晦暗的銅箱，打開一看滿滿的一箱的金幣！</p>
<p>使掘金者始終抱着希望的，還有看了佛羅列達州勃德的家庭而更堅信念。據說勃德的銀行事業，五金業，地產，都是從發掘到的一簟藏金起家。這雙箱子，被一海盜拉荾脫埋在史華尼河口。。其時、德的祖父開了一　鋸木廠，有一個朋友送給祖父一幅藏金地形圖，勃德按圖索金，果然一舉成功，奠定了他們家庭和事業的基礎。</p>
<p>大家都以爲美國政府擁有已經發掘出來的藏金之半數，其實不確。據說政府抽値不能起過百分之二十五，有少到百分之十者。但政府有權用現款收購發掘到的黃金云。</p>

<h3>On the Issue of U.S. Aid to China, President Zhang Issues a Special Statement Elaborating on Ten Financial and Economic Reforms</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 28th] Zhang Qun, President of the Executive Yuan, recently issued a statement on the Chinese government's position regarding U.S. aid to China. This statement was formally announced by Director Hua Xian'guang at a press conference on the 28th. The statement said: China has experienced more than eight years of long-term resistance against Japan, compounded by the rebellion of the communists, and is therefore encountering unprecedented economic difficulties today. In order to overcome these difficulties, the Chinese government, in view of the long-standing friendship between China and the United States, has requested the U.S. government to grant us economic and technical assistance. The interim aid bill passed by the U.S. Congress has included China, and the U.S. government has also stated that it will propose a practical aid plan for China in the current session of the U.S. Congress. The Chinese government expresses its pleasure at this. The Chinese government is aware that it must have a complete and effective self-help plan, followed or complemented by general administrative and military reforms. The main financial and economic reforms that the Chinese government is preparing to implement are approximately as follows:</p>
<p>Reducing all government expenditures as much as possible – both in terms of legal tender and foreign currency. Improving the national tax, provincial tax, and local tax systems and their administration to achieve the dual goals of increasing revenue and equalizing the burden. To improve the work efficiency of civil servants and officers and soldiers, their treatment will be gradually improved, while a plan for the gradual reduction of personnel will be implemented. The control of daily necessities must be strengthened and the scope expanded to prevent speculation and soaring prices. Making every effort to establish a foundation that will stabilize the currency system so that foreign aid can achieve maximum effectiveness. Improving the banking and credit system, strengthening the regulatory responsibility of the Central Bank, and continuing to promote policies to curb inflation. Encouraging the export of goods and making every effort to remove obstacles to exports. Improving the control of imported goods, and when the environment permits, the control measures containing emergency measures will be adjusted as appropriate. Developing agricultural production, improving the rural economy, and implementing land reform. The suggestions of the Sino-U.S. Agricultural Technology Cooperation Group will be adopted as soon as they can be implemented. Restoring transportation and important industries and mines as much as possible, in order to increase production and reduce excessive reliance on imports of foreign goods. (Editor's note: The above ten key points of reform were published in this newspaper on the 24th)</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 28th] Our embassy in the United States today issued here the ten-point financial and economic reform plan to be implemented by the Chinese government, as announced by President Zhang Qun of the Executive Yuan. This statement was issued simultaneously in Nanjing. The publication of this reconstruction plan coincides with the time when our technical delegation is holding talks with U.S. officials here, and it also coincides with the eve of the presentation of the U.S. aid to China plan to Congress.</p>
<h3>Ambassador Ma Received Bei Zuyi Yesterday; The Aid to China Plan is Expected to be Submitted Early Next Month</h3>
<p>[This newspaper, Nanjing, 28th] According to sources here: U.S. Secretary of State Marshall received Bei Zuyi, head of our technical delegation to the United States, on the afternoon of the 28th. Mr. Bei was accompanied by Ambassador Gu Weijun. Although external sources stated that they could not disclose the content of the meeting, they were obviously pleased with this encouraging development.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 27th] Secretary of State Marshall said last week that he intended to submit the aid to China plan to the National Advisory Committee and the Budget Bureau "within a week." The "one week" mentioned by Marshall will expire on the 29th.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 27th, United Press] A well-informed source said: President Truman is expected to submit the aid to China plan to Congress in the first half of February. It also said that the State Department has submitted the plan to the Budget Bureau, and then sent it to the National Advisory Committee to complete its preparation work, so as to submit it to the legislative body for discussion. He declined to disclose the total amount of the loan listed in the aid to China plan, but said that it would be more than 300 million U.S. dollars. This amount of 300 million was proposed by Marshall under the urging of Congress before February. He also pointed out that the Budget Bureau should be able to handle the aid to China plan quickly, because it does not involve particularly complicated financial calculations. The National Advisory Committee is a policy institution for such matters, so it is expected that it will also be handled quickly, because the pressure from Congress to submit this plan as soon as possible is increasing day by day. All the above factors are precursors to the early submission of the aid to China plan to Congress. It is heard that some officials are dissatisfied with Marshall's secret policy and his delay in deciding on the aid to China plan. Apart from Zhou Yide and other few who advocate aid to China, there are also some Republicans who share the same views as the above-mentioned officials, such as Senator Bridges, chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee.</p>
<p>[This newspaper] New York, 28th Broadcasting: Scripps Howard newspapers commented today, urging the United States to speed up aid to China. It said: The sphere of influence of the Chinese Communist Party is expanding day by day, and the future is worrying. The Northeast is the key to the Far East, not only controlling China and Korea, but also the gateway to Siberia and Japan. The outbreak of the First World War was caused by Japan's seizure of the Northeast. From an economic point of view, the Northeast is to Asia as the Ruhr area is to Europe. During the Great War, China restrained millions of Japanese troops and was a loyal ally of the United States. At this critical moment, the United States should provide assistance.</p>
<h3>The Two Cases of Kowloon City and Shamian Must be Resolved in Order; Foreign Minister Wang Reports to the Central Political Committee</h3>
<p>[This newspaper, Nanjing, 28th] The Shamian incident will be resolved according to international practice after the Kowloon problem is resolved. The government will also study and reply to the protest raised by London regarding the Shamian incident after the Kowloon problem is resolved. This was mentioned by Foreign Minister Wang at the Foreign Affairs report at the Central Political Committee on the 28th.</p>
<p>Shi Zhaoying's Speech</p>
<p>[This newspaper, Nanjing, 28th] Regarding Sino-British negotiations, Shi Zhaoying, Director of the Information Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, said at a press conference held by the Executive Yuan's Information Bureau on the 28th: The Kowloon City and Shamian incidents in Guangzhou are still under negotiation between the Chinese and British governments, and we hope to reach a reasonable solution that will satisfy both parties. The British Foreign Office's note to Zheng Tianxi, our ambassador to the United Kingdom, on the 24th (the content of which is in another article) clarifies the British view of the Kowloon City incident. Our country has not yet replied to it. A spokesman for the British Embassy also told reporters on the 28th: The negotiations are still in progress, and we hope to resolve them as soon as possible. As for our permission to the British Embassy for compensation for the Shamian incident, he firmly stated that he had indeed obtained a written reply from the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs, but our Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesman said: When Mr. Reubowski, Counselor of the British Embassy, visited Mr. Yin Baozi, Director of the European Department, Yin handed him a document, which only stated that the destruction of the British Consulate in Shamian, Guangzhou, would be handled in accordance with international practice. This is no different from the position publicly announced by Director Shi Zhaoying of the Information Department on the 21st. However, it seems too hasty to say that this announcement means a specific reply that compensation should be granted. Our side is still waiting for the British government's reply to our protest regarding the Kowloon City incident. As for the Shamian incident in Guangzhou, our side still needs to wait for a detailed investigation to be completed before a specific decision can be made.</p>
<h3>Dong Xian'guang Corrects a Thames Newspaper Editorial</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 28th] Director Dong Xian'guang said at a press conference on the 28th: An editorial in the London Times on January 24 stated that "The Chinese authorities seem to have realized that the anti-British movement incited by some Chinese newspapers is endangering Sino-British relations, so they have banned the publication of news about the Shamian incident, except for those issued by government agencies." This statement completely distorts the relationship between the Chinese government and the press and must be corrected to set things right. I can responsibly state that no government agency has ever "banned the publication of news about the Shamian incident." Constitutional government has been implemented, and there is absolutely no possibility of "banning publication." I am in charge of the Executive Yuan's Information Bureau. Hearing these words, I will take the "government agencies" mentioned by the newspaper to refer to me as the one who is ordered to release news about the Shamian incident. I am very surprised by what the Thames newspaper editorial said. I am eager to know who issued this instruction and on what authority the issuer based it.</p>
<h3>The Investigation of the Shamian Case is Over; Pan Hankui Returns to Nanjing to Report</h3>
<p>[This newspaper, Guangzhou, 28th] Mr. Pan Hankui, who was responsible for investigating the Shamian incident in Guangzhou, delayed his work and only flew back to Nanjing on the 28th to report.</p>
<p>[United Press, Nanjing, 28th] According to reports, the British government has agreed to release the detained Chinese in Kowloon City and promised not to make arrests during the talks, but this has been denied by the British Embassy.</p>
<h3>The British Released a Note to Us Regarding the Kowloon City Incident</h3>
<p>Hope that Jurisdiction and Eviction Issues Can Be Handled Separately</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 27th] The British Foreign Office officially released the content of the note sent to Dr. Zheng Tianxi, the Chinese Ambassador to the United Kingdom, on the 24th regarding the Kowloon City incident, expressing the British government's sincere hope that the issue of jurisdiction over Kowloon City can be handled separately from the recent issue of ordering residents "occupying" the area to relocate. The British government deeply regrets that riots caused by the eviction occurred while negotiations on the future status of Kowloon were still in progress. The British government believes that the aforementioned negotiations are still in progress, and the government hopes to be able to present its views to the Chinese government soon. The British government's note also pointed out that it would be a major mistake if the Hong Kong government could not take administrative measures for the welfare of the Kowloon area because the issue of jurisdiction over Kowloon City was still under discussion. The note reviewed the eviction of residents from the old urban area and the actions of the Hong Kong police on January 5, and also criticized Chinese newspapers for systematically inciting anti-British movements for several weeks. For example, the Hong Kong National Daily published exaggerated and distorted reports. Furthermore, the speech delivered by Magistrate An to the residents of Kowloon City under the Chinese flag after the Hong Kong side implemented the eviction order for the first time was also a provocative act, and Chinese newspapers recognized this action as reaffirming China's sovereignty. The British government believes that the Hong Kong government has sufficient reasons to decide to clear the occupied area and believes that the Hong Kong government has given thorough consideration to the "occupying" residents. The British government further believes that if the entire course of events can be made public to the Chinese people in an appropriate manner, the entire issue will inevitably be observed in a calmer and more objective spirit. Therefore, the note finally emphasized the appropriateness of making all the facts public to the Chinese people. The note did not mention the Guangzhou incident. Britain recently sent a note to China requesting compensation for the losses suffered by British property in Guangzhou during the anti-British movement. The note subsequently submitted by the Chinese government did not mention the British side's request, but only requested compensation for the losses in the Kowloon City incident.</p>
<h3>Our Ministry of Foreign Affairs Spokesman's Views on the British Note</h3>
<p>Stated the Reasons for the Kowloon City Incident</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 28th] The Central News Agency reporter recently asked Director Shi Zhaoying of the Information Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for his views on the note from British Foreign Secretary Bevin to Ambassador Zheng Tianxi. According to reports: Our people are indeed very willing to learn more about the British official's views on the Kowloon City incident, but the Chinese people will definitely remember that our Ministry of Foreign Affairs and its representatives in Hong Kong seriously advised the Hong Kong government before January 5 that it should not take coercive measures in areas where our country has never abandoned its sovereignty, and reiterated this serious advice repeatedly before January 12. The Hong Kong government's failure to give appropriate consideration to the above advice is the main reason for the unfortunate incident of shooting and tear gas on January 12.</p>
<h3>Listed Companies' Stock Certificates Must Be Reissued with New Stocks by a Deadline; The Shanghai Stock Exchange's Application for Extension is Rejected</h3>
<p>[This newspaper, Nanjing, 28th] The Shanghai Stock Exchange's application to the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Economic Affairs to extend the "Measures for the Transfer of Company Stocks" listed on the market until the end of March of the 37th year has been decided not to be extended after consultation between the Currency Department of the Ministry of Finance and the Commercial Department of the Ministry of Economic Affairs. The Shanghai Stock Exchange has been instructed to implement six measures, which are as follows: Those who have been approved by the company law to increase capital, change registration, and obtain a license, but have not printed new stocks, or the stocks are being reissued and have not been fully completed, are allowed to be listed temporarily with stock certificates, but are still limited to reissuing new stocks uniformly before the middle of March of this year, and new stocks will be listed from March 16. From the date of receipt of the document, those who have applied to the local competent authorities for approval of registration changes regarding the increase of capital must submit the application documents to the Shanghai Stock Exchange for verification, and they are allowed to be listed temporarily with stock certificates in accordance with the previous provisions, and they should still reissue new stocks for listing within one month after the approval of the registration change. Those who have formulated a stock value increase plan in accordance with the method of re-determining the value of fixed assets in the industrial and mining transportation industry and submitted it to the Ministry of Economic Affairs for approval, and hold the approval documents, but have not applied for registration changes, are temporarily allowed to list and trade receipts or other certificates according to the number of increased stocks, but are limited to applying to the local competent authorities for registration changes within half a month from the date of receipt of the document, and submitting the application documents to the Shanghai Stock Exchange for verification, they are still allowed to be listed temporarily. Those who have been approved for registration changes should reissue new stocks for listing within one month after the approval of registration in accordance with the provisions of the second item. Those who have not applied for capital increase registration in accordance with the Company Law, or have not submitted an application for valuation and capital increase in accordance with the method of re-evaluating the value of fixed assets in the industrial and mining transportation industry, will all be temporarily listed according to the original number of stocks before the capital increase, and new stocks will still be reissued for listing within one month after the approval of registration. Those who have not processed the registration changes in accordance with the handling measures for the registration of various companies in the recovered area will all be temporarily suspended from listing. From the date of receipt of the document, those who newly report to the Shanghai Stock Exchange for capital increase or valuation and capital increase in accordance with the method of re-evaluating the value of fixed assets in the industrial and mining transportation industry shall not list the stocks after the capital increase until they have been approved for registration changes and reissued new stocks. The instructions were issued on the 28th.</p>
<h3>The United States Reveals Its Intention to Delay the Opening of the Peace Conference</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 27th] Informed sources said on the 27th that the United States has "de facto abandoned" its intention to urge the early convening of the peace conference with Japan. On the contrary, the United States will increase its efforts to assist Japan's economic recovery under occupation and can wait for a more appropriate time to devote itself to the Japanese peace conference. It is said that no firm decision has been made on this matter. According to recent discussions by U.S. officials, it is believed that they will choose one of two paths: (Continued on page 2, column 1)</p>
<h3>We Are Studying the U.S. Plan to Rehabilitate Japan by Experts</h3>
<p>Director Dong Answers Reporters' Questions</p>
<p>[This newspaper, Nanjing, 28th] At the Executive Yuan's press conference, someone asked Director Dong Xian'guang that according to Shanghai news, our side believes that the plan proposed by the U.S. representative on the Far Eastern Commission to rehabilitate Japan is unsatisfactory and may express something. I wonder what Director Dong's opinion is? Dong replied that this matter is still waiting for experts to study, and I have no opinion. Secondly, a reporter raised a diplomatic question, that is, it is heard that our merchants on the French-Vietnamese border have been robbed of mules and horses by the French. What countermeasures will our government take? Director Shi of the Information Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs replied that wars cannot occur where there is a war, but the countermeasures to be taken will only be decided after the facts have been ascertained.</p>
<h3>A Batch of Munitions and Aircraft Departed from Canada</h3>
<p>[United Press, Halifax, Canada, 28th] Six hundred tons of munitions and thirty combat aircraft purchased by the Chinese government set sail for China on the freighter "Lakeside" last night. Not long ago, another freighter, "Islandside," carried 650 tons of small arms and munitions and several aircraft to China. In addition, more than 20 fighter jets were delivered by train yesterday, ready to be shipped to China by "Seaside," which is expected to arrive at the port within ten days.</p>
<h3>Supervision Committee Proposes Improving the Treatment of Public Education Personnel, Which Will Be Submitted to the President and Then to the National Government</h3>
<p>[This newspaper, Nanjing, 28th] The Supervision Yuan passed the proposal to improve the treatment of public education personnel at a discussion meeting on the 26th. It has been drafted and submitted by 19 members of the committee, including Miao Peicheng and Yu Shude, to President Yu Youren on the 28th, who will then submit it to the National Government. The full text of the proposal is as follows:</p>
<p>"For the matter of the proposal: This adjustment of the treatment of public education personnel is based on the cost of living index and is issued every three months. Regarding the allocation of in-kind goods, in addition to the allocation of two dou of rice per person per month, items such as oil, coal, cloth, sugar, and salt are all cancelled. It is found that the Legislative Yuan, the Political Participation Council, and our Yuan previously proposed to improve the treatment of public education personnel, and it was proposed that adjustments be made monthly according to the cost of living index, and that the original in-kind goods should still be allocated. At present, commodity prices fluctuate sharply, and the index is soaring from time to time. Adjustments are made once every three months, which is very different from the cost of living index. For public education personnel with a base salary of 100 yuan, the salary and allowances in December of last year were 1.39 million yuan (990,000 yuan for living allowances, plus 400,000 yuan for the multiplier), and the difference between in-kind goods and market prices was about 1.4 million yuan (870,000 yuan for two bags of flour, 70,000 yuan for three catties of cooking oil, more than 200,000 yuan for two loads of coal balls, more than 30,000 yuan for two catties of sugar, 20,000 yuan for four catties of salt, and about 200,000 yuan for cloth), totaling about 2.8 million yuan (excluding the surplus of living allowances). If we calculate according to the new adjustment method in February of this year, the salary and allowances and rice price will only be more than 3.5 million yuan (2.55 million yuan calculated according to the basic cost of living index of 30 yuan, 595,000 yuan for one-tenth of the 70 yuan index, and about 360,000 yuan for three dou of rice). Compared with the two months, February only increased by more than 700,000 yuan, but the commodity prices in February were several times higher than those in December of last year, so this adjustment not only did not increase the benefits of public education personnel, but also reduced them, making life even more difficult. The government's allocation of in-kind goods to public education personnel in major cities was originally to stabilize commodity prices and control the market. Once the existing allocation is cancelled, it will cause a large number of consumers to compete for materials in the market, driving up commodity prices, which is inevitable. This method actually runs counter to the economic emergency measures program and loses the original intention of adjusting treatment. The members of the committee are aware of this, and in order to stabilize the lives of public education personnel, that is, to stabilize politics, it is proposed to restore the original allocation method, or adjust the treatment of public education personnel monthly according to the cost of living index from February to make up for it. Is it appropriate? I respectfully request you to review and submit it (title omitted)."</p>

<h3>Business Profit Tax: Collection Method Prepared; Ministry of Finance to Officially Announce and Implement Soon</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Bureau, 28th] Regarding the 1948 Business Profit Tax collection method, the Ministry of Finance, based on the principles passed by the Executive Yuan, has prepared detailed measures, totaling fourteen articles. It was reported at the Executive Yuan meeting on the 27th and will be announced and implemented soon. The main contents of the measures are as follows: The income tax for 1948 will be collected using an estimated payment method. The estimated payment will be adjusted with refunds or additional payments after the official tax amount is calculated and determined in the future. Any overpaid amount will be given statutory interest. The standard for the estimated payment will be based on a comparison of the tax revenue budgets for 1948 and 1947, the increase in business profits, and the price increases between 1948 and 1947. The estimated payment will be temporarily set at six times the previous year's tax amount. Newly established businesses in 1947 and businesses established before the end of 1946 that have not yet paid taxes will be required to pay 12.6% of their capital. Local tax authorities will begin filling out tax bills from February 15th and must complete the delivery to taxpayers within one month. Taxpayers must pay the tax within twenty days of receiving the tax notice. It is understood that the Ministry of Finance will officially announce and implement these measures soon. However, the point regarding the estimated payment being six times the previous year's tax amount is still under final consideration. Finance Minister Yu Hongjun will also make a statement when the measures are announced to provide explanations. According to estimates from relevant parties, after the estimated payment method for the 1948 Business Profit Tax is adopted, this tax revenue could reach over 40 trillion yuan before April of this year.</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Should Industrial Goods be Opened up Under the Fixed-Order System?</h3>
<p>The so-called fixed-order loan method is an important part of the economic reform plan. This newspaper has previously published articles separately pointing out its effects and gains and losses. Although all loans are currently suspended, the various implementation methods recently announced have not deleted these loan methods. Furthermore, given the urgent appeals from the Northern Petition Delegation and the unanimous demands from industrial and commercial circles across the country, the authorities are reconsidering industrial loans, and the general trend seems to be that there is a possibility of selectively opening them up through this method. If the comprehensive allocation method is fully implemented, controlling materials will become an important condition for allocation, and the use of fixed orders to replace procurement will inevitably increase.</p>
<p>However, the views of the authorities and the industrial and commercial circles on this issue do not seem to be the same. The authorities emphasize controlling materials, and financial turnover seems to be secondary. The focus of the industrial and commercial circles is on financial accommodation, and whether they are willing to easily give up their materials is still a question. The reason is very simple. In this era of rising prices, when hoarding is the most profitable, who would be willing to sell as soon as they produce and miss the sure profits in front of them? Engaging in industry is currently the most difficult, so who would be willing to throw out fixed orders as much as possible just to obtain a loan and only earn some superficially legal profits? Moreover, according to past examples of official price purchases and the price limits set by the government, they are often too harsh and unreasonable, causing producers to hesitate. Various exceptional expenses and apportionments, the difficulty of replenishing raw materials, the difficulty of replenishing machinery, and the future cost calculation after wages are calculated according to the index and donations and taxes and power are adjusted at any time are extremely difficult, and generally, they will inevitably increase day by day. Under these extraordinary circumstances, unless it is absolutely necessary to drink poison to quench thirst and temporarily relieve the immediate crisis, they will probably not enthusiastically respond to the fixed-order loans as the authorities expect.</p>
<p>Of course, this type of loan is not mandatory. The government is tightening monetary policy and contracting currency to curb inflation. If manufacturers are unwilling to take out loans and find their own solutions, isn't that what the authorities would be happy to hear? However, the difficulty of financing affects current production and severely impacts future development. This seems very noteworthy from the perspective of the overall national economy. Currently, fixed-order loans have not yet been implemented, and only a guideline for contract spinning, weaving, unified purchase and sale has been set forth in the control plan for cotton yarn and cloth. However, because of this, many in the textile industry are already preparing to tighten their belts as much as possible. This is a useful reference for the progress of fixed-order loans.</p>
<p>Even if manufacturers are happy to accept it and this loan method can be successfully launched, we must also have considerable reservations about its scope and effectiveness. Because government fixed orders are mainly used for allocation, followed by military and public use. As for what to do with the huge amounts of goods ordered beyond military, public, and allocation purposes, it is necessary to consider this first. If they are sold as they are produced and supplied to the market, it is similar to state-run commerce. Except for essential necessities for people's livelihood, this policy has not been established in various economic plans and measures. If they are temporarily stored and sold at a higher price, how can this be reconciled with the regulations prohibiting hoarding and profiteering? The most ideal way, of course, is to regulate the supply and demand and transport large quantities of products produced locally to other places. However, based on the precedents of the transportation of yarn, cloth, grain, coal, and raw silk, it is difficult to believe that the current material agencies have this sufficient capacity. Isn't the purchase of cotton still entrusted to others? And isn't the coal stacked in the preparation area unable to be transported to major cities for use? Based on this reasoning, the so-called fixed-order loans are likely to narrow the scope and designate certain goods, such as daily necessities, to handle, and it is also possible to designate certain areas, such as Shanghai, to try out. This reduces the burden on the organizer and makes it easier to gather things, and it can also greatly help in terms of allocation. However, this local plan is only for the organizer and does not take into account the government's important mission of helping industry and commerce increase production, nor does it take into account the widespread aspirations of industrial and commercial circles in various places.</p>
<p>Originally, the promotion of loans, regardless of what method is adopted, its other meaning is to increase issuance and inflate currency, thereby stimulating prices and endangering people's livelihood. Therefore, after deep reflection, it is necessary to adopt the so-called "financial cutoff" policy to correct the current situation. This was originally a last resort. However, under other loan methods, the objects and amounts of the loans can still be selected by the national banks, and the initiative is completely in the hands of the national banks, whether to lend or not, or how much to lend. If fixed-order loans are implemented, then in theory, anyone who meets these conditions should be treated equally, regardless of closeness or distance; moreover, the amount of the loan should be based on the amount of production and fixed orders, and should not be arbitrarily reduced or freely approved. Otherwise, the policy of fixed-order loans cannot be fully implemented. Therefore, whether national banks have such a large amount of money to deal with this matter, or in other words, whether it is possible to expand issuance to bear this loan, this question is very important. We believe that it is inappropriate to provide fixed-order loans for the production of a certain factory and refuse it for other factories producing the same product; it is also unreasonable to provide fixed-order loans for a part of a certain factory's products and refuse it for the same products from the same factory; it is even more unreasonable to provide fixed-order loans for a factory's products in Area A and refuse it for the same products from factories in Area B, C, etc. In the past, various loans were often criticized for favoring certain classes, and the reason was the uneven treatment. If fixed-order loans are still not implemented in a universal and uniform way, then it is better to conduct thorough research before announcing and implementing them to achieve the most appropriate compromise and facilitate implementation, rather than encountering various difficulties after implementation, and then trying to fix them piecemeal, creating many biased and uneven phenomena. Therefore, although the timing for this loan method is gradually maturing and it seems that the arrow is already on the string and must be fired, we are anxiously overthinking and hope that everyone will reconsider it carefully. Of course, we are not opposed to opening up loans, nor are we absolutely opposed to this loan method. We would rather say that we support considerable loans, but we do not want to see the shortcomings of past loans still remain in the future.</p>
<h3>U.S. Intentions on the Peace Conference</h3>
<p>[Continued from Page 1] Continue to exert pressure to convene the peace conference with Japan as soon as possible, and adopt a compromise attitude towards China and the Soviet Union, which insist on retaining the veto power in the peace conference. It is admitted that the differences between China, the Soviet Union, and the United States and Britain cannot be reconciled at present, and this matter should be abandoned until future developments change the situation and make a compromise solution possible. These officials understand that the reason why China does not agree to participate in a peace conference without veto power is that it fears that the United States will take an excessively lenient attitude towards Japan's industrial level. If China does not have veto power, it will not be able to do anything about it. However, they said that there are two points on the industrial level on which they cannot agree with China: The level set by China is not enough to make Japan self-sufficient and must seek foreign assistance. The United States must provide assistance at that time, and the government fears that taxpayers will rise up in opposition one day. For these two reasons, the United States has decided to temporarily shelve its hope of convening the peace conference as soon as possible to seek coordination.</p>
<h3>Tibetan Business Delegation Arrives in Shanghai</h3>
<p>(Continued from Page 1)</p>
<p>More than a month in India</p>
<p>The delegation members are all influential figures in Tibetan politics and business circles. The head of the delegation, Xia Guoba, is currently the General Manager of the Lhasa Silver Bureau. They left Tibet for India two months ago and stayed in India for more than a month, visiting various commercial situations. It is reported that in the past, there were very few commercial transactions between Tibet and India. Only a small amount of cloth and iron were imported from India each year, and Tibetan specialties such as wool, leather, and medicinal materials were only exported to India and then re-exported to the United States and Britain. Therefore, in addition to visiting, they did not conduct any commercial contacts in India.</p>
<p>Head of Delegation's Speech</p>
<p>According to Xia Guoba, in the past, the routes for trading goods between Tibet and the outside world were mainly four: through Yunnan, through Kangding, through Qinghai, and waterways mainly through India. In the past, there were no accurate statistics, so the quantity of goods traded could not be investigated. The main task of this delegation's visit to the mainland is to study in detail where it is most cost-effective to purchase the goods needed by Tibetans and where the most convenient transportation route is, in order to formulate plans after returning to Tibet for formal and large-scale trade with the mainland. It is reported that the most urgently needed goods for Tibetans are tea, silk, and porcelain.</p>
<p>Current Situation in Tibet</p>
<p>The Tibetan local government is currently headed by the 13-year-old Dalai Lama, while the Regent Da Zhazha handles all religious and political duties. Under the Regent Da Zhazha, there are the "Kashag" and forty "Kalons" (both political institutions), which are responsible for various departments. There is currently no machine industry in the area, only handicraft industries such as weaving wool. The "Pulu" (material name, similar to broadcloth), woven from wool, is the clothing material worn by Tibetans all year round. In addition to ordinary residents, monks wear pure red "Pulu," which is brightly colored and highly representative of the Tibetan religion. Tibetans still wear long robes, and since there are no motor vehicles, horses are used as transportation.</p>
<p>Departure to Nanjing Soon</p>
<p>The delegation members wore Tibetan clothing on their way from India to Hong Kong, but later changed into Western clothing in Hong Kong due to being noticed and surrounded by residents, which made it inconvenient to move around.</p>
<p>The delegation brought letters from the Dalai Lama and the Regent Da Zhazha to the Chairman, as well as several Tibetan specialties. They plan to stay in Shanghai for two days and then go to Nanjing to meet with the Chairman and present the letters. At the same time, they will also visit Committee Member Xu of the Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission and relevant ministries to discuss future methods of trading goods between Tibet and the mainland. If time permits, they also plan to visit Beijing for inspection.</p>
<p>Today, the municipal government will arrange an itinerary for them to visit major factories in the city, and Secretary-General Shen will jointly host a banquet with various sectors this afternoon to warmly welcome them.</p>
<h3>First Batch of Japanese Reparations Machines: Over 2,000 Total Value Allocated to Private Sector</h3>
<p>Application Deadline Set for Mid-March</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Bureau, 28th] According to the Ministry of Economic Affairs: A total of 9,447 machine tools from Japan's reparations to China, of which 2,362 have been allocated to the Ministry for distribution to private sector businesses. These machine tools include 20 boring machines, 181 iron beds, 13 gear cutting machines, 163 grinders, 1,307 lathes, 256 milling machines, 19 gantry planers, 183 shapers and other, 12 bending machines, 2 hydraulic presses, 32 mechanical presses, 131 hand presses, 17 shears and punching machines, 24 metalworking machines, and 2 wire forming machines. It is reported that the various machine tools have been successively shipped from Japan. The Ministry has ordered the Shanghai Industrial and Commercial Guidance Office to receive and store them, and in accordance with the Executive Yuan's order, representatives from the Ministry of Economic Affairs, the Ministry of Finance, and national people's industrial and commercial groups will jointly form an evaluation committee to accurately assess the value to facilitate the price allocation. The scope of the price allocation for this batch will focus on developing the textile industry, followed by the paper industry, electrical industry, and coal mines. Industries that manufacture or repair textile, paper, and electrical machinery, and coal mines that increase coal production can apply for price allocation. Other industries will be allocated later, after the second batch of machine tools is drawn. It is also reported that the main condition for this batch of machine tools is the ability to use them most quickly. Remote areas with inconvenient transportation, or areas still in the pacification zone, that are difficult to transport to, difficult to utilize in the short term, or areas that have suffered war losses and have no urgent need will be allocated later. As for the application procedures for price allocation, the application form and factory construction plan form issued by the Executive Yuan must be filled out in triplicate and submitted to the Ministry of Economic Affairs. After the Ministry reviews and forwards them to the Compensation Committee of the Executive Yuan for approval, a contract can be signed, the price paid, and the purchased machine tools can be collected for installation and construction. The application deadline is from the date of the announcement until March 15th of this year. The machine tool list and application procedures can be obtained for 100,000 yuan from the Ministry of Economic Affairs or the Industrial and Commercial Guidance Offices in Shanghai, Hankou, Chongqing, Guangzhou, and Tianjin.</p>

<p>According to Director Chen's report to reporters, the association strives for speed in handling relief supplies. This time, the two ships "California" and "Labartia" transported flour to China. The U.S. shipping company planned to complete unloading in ten days, but the association accelerated its work and completed unloading in eight days, thus receiving a bonus of approximately US$3,000 from the two shipping companies. On the 30th of this month, two more ships of relief supplies will arrive here.</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 28th] The Press Bureau of the Ministry of National Defense announced the one-week war situation from January 21st to 28th on the 28th. The full text is as follows:</p>
<p>Situation: Since the Communist troops on various battlefields suffered heavy blows from the National Army in the previous two weeks, most of them have been resisting stubbornly this week, except for a few who attempted to use offense as defense. Therefore, the various battlefields seem to be temporarily silent with the wind, snow, and severe cold. However, our heroic National Army is still continuously striking at the remaining bandits.</p>
<p>In the Northeast, the entire 2nd and 7th Columns and part of the 8th Column of the Communist troops, along with the main force of the artillery brigade, totaling more than 60,000 men, attacked Xinlitun. From the 20th to the present, more than half of the Communist troops have been killed or wounded, but they still cannot cross the Lei Chi pool, creating brilliant achievements for the National Army. To cooperate with the victory at Xinlitun, the National Army also took mobile sweeps in various places. On the 18th, the National Army annihilated the remaining bandits of the 8th Column in the northwestern part of Liaobei. On the 24th, a strong force of the National Army in Liaobei recovered Dong, Xi, and Yongji in one fell swoop. The National Army also launched sweeps and recovered Huapichang and many other important strongholds on the 20th.</p>
<p>In North China, Nie Rongzhen's Communist troops have been scattered since their disastrous defeat on the outskirts of Baoding. The remnants of its 5th and 7th Columns fled to the mountains west of Mancheng, while its 1st Column fled to Zhaizhang. They suffered heavy casualties after being bombed by our air force on the way. On the 24th, they fled to the mountains northwest of Zhangfang. The remnants of the 4th Column fled east from Wangdu. On the 24th, the main force fled to Renqiu. There are currently no bandit traces on either side of the Pingbao Road.</p>
<p>In the Su Lu Yu Wan area, Chen Yi's Communist troops have been repeatedly suppressed by the National Army over the past week and are in a passive position everywhere. They are now cut into two sections by the National Army. The remnants of its 10th and 11th Columns were annihilated between Cao County and Chengwu, while the remnants of the 1st, 3rd, 4th, 6th, and 8th Columns are forced to the area between Xuchang and Xiangcheng, where the National Army is encircling and annihilating them from all sides.</p>
<p>In the Yu E Wan area, Liu's Communist troops have done everything possible to change their tactics in order to avoid the National Army's search and suppression over the past week. However, the National Army, in close cooperation with local teams, is encircling and suppressing them from all sides. In addition, the bandits have not yet been fully clothed in cotton clothes and are suffering from cold and hunger, with more than half of them dead. The bandits in the mountainous areas are now at the end of their rope. On the 23rd, its 12th Column raided the vicinity of Tang County town to plunder food and clothing for warmth. They were encircled and suppressed by the National Army in separate routes. On the 26th, they fled back to the vicinity of the Dabie Mountains. Its 10th Column and Chen Geng's Communist troops have been repeatedly encircled and annihilated by local teams and the National Army in the southeast of Deng County and the Manchuanguan area of Zhechuan. They have been routed and are now fleeing to the areas between Yunxi Yun County and Deng County Xinye. Part of the 9th Column fled to the vicinity of Shahe Town in an attempt to escape annihilation. However, our teams are assisting the National Army to step up the search and suppression, striving to thoroughly eliminate them before stopping.</p>
<p>Results: In the Northeast battlefield this week, more than 22,000 bandits were killed or wounded, more than 550 bandits were captured, and 3 82mm mortars, more than 30 light and heavy machine guns, more than 330 rifles, 37 grenade launchers, and 60,000 rounds of various gun and artillery shells were seized.</p>
<p>In the North China battlefield, more than 5,000 bandits were killed or wounded, 77 bandits were captured, and 107 rifles and 3 pistols were seized this week.</p>
<p>In the Su Lu Yu Wan area, more than 11,000 bandits were killed or wounded, more than 700 bandits were captured, and 5 heavy machine guns, 13 light machine guns, 93 rifles, more than 140 hand grenades, and 19,300 rounds of rifle ammunition were seized this week. (The above figures are based on statistics reported from various sources and do not include the figures from the Pu Shaan area).</p>

<h3>National Public Opposes New Anglo-Iraqi Treaty; Iraqi Cabinet Resigns En Masse; British Anti-Communist Plan in the Middle East Suffers Setback</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Baghdad, 27th] The Iraqi government, led by Prime Minister Jabir, has announced its resignation. Jabir flew to Baghdad from Britain 36 hours before the cabinet's resignation. Protests against the new Anglo-Iraqi treaty have intensified. Demonstrations on the streets of Baghdad even involved the use of machine guns, resulting in several deaths and injuries. Under these circumstances, Jabir, who signed the new Anglo-Iraqi treaty in London, had no choice but to announce his resignation. After the cabinet's resignation, the Iraqi Regent broadcast to the nation, calling for cooperation to avoid bloodshed. Upon hearing the news of the government's resignation, many people cheered and danced wildly in the streets. The Speaker of the Iraqi Lower House and 30 members of parliament also resigned at the same time.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 27th] There is no hiding the serious concern here regarding the forced resignation of the Iraqi government. Diplomatic circles also expect that the Anglo-Iraqi treaty, signed on January 15th but not yet ratified, may be renegotiated. The British government's position is that until the new treaty is ratified, relations between Britain and Iraq will continue to be governed by the Anglo-Iraqi Treaty of 1935. The treaty was originally scheduled to expire in 1952 and will remain in effect unless modified by mutual agreement.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, London, 27th] Government officials declared today that the Iraqi cabinet's resignation is a major blow to Britain's plan to prevent communism in the Middle East. The cabinet's resignation and the Baghdad riots indicate that Prime Minister Jabir's attempt to promote the ratification of the Anglo-Iraqi Treaty of Friendship and Military Assistance has ended. Officials expressed deep disappointment upon receiving the news. Foreign Secretary Bevin once called the treaty a "template" that he hoped to use to gradually sign alliances with Middle Eastern countries, thereby establishing a joint British-Arab security system. British representatives are expected to continue to work behind the scenes in Iraq to support the new Prime Minister in winning public acceptance of the treaty. Foreign officials are currently in London discussing the signing of a similar treaty, and Saudi Arabian officials have also agreed to begin negotiations here at the end of this month. In addition, Britain hopes to reopen negotiations with Egypt on the long-stalled treaty revisions.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, London, 27th] Government sources claimed today that Foreign Secretary Bevin has begun negotiations with Arab leaders on Middle Eastern issues in order to negotiate a joint anti-communist security plan with Arab countries, which is expected to eventually involve the military strategies of both Britain and the United States. Bevin is more concerned about Soviet ambitions in the Middle East than the Palestinian-Jewish conflict. Bevin intends to create a bulwark to prevent Greek guerrillas from threatening the British and American dominance of the Suez Canal and the Mediterranean once they win. This is part of a joint plan by the British Foreign Office and the US State Department.</p>
<h3>Parliamentary Debate on Currency Devaluation; Premier Appeals with Resignation Threat; Technical Amendments Made to Free Gold Trading Bill</h3>
<p>[Our dispatch] London, 28th Broadcast: Paris dispatch, the Socialist Party decided to abstain from voting on the issue of the French franc devaluation in the National Assembly, its intention is obviously to avoid the collapse of the Schuman Cabinet.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Paris, 28th] A Socialist Party spokesman said that Prime Minister Schuman has agreed to make some technical amendments to the bill to establish a free gold market in order to allow Parliament to pass it.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Paris, 27th] Prime Minister Schuman warned the National Assembly today that if the Assembly rejects the government's bill to establish a free gold market, the government will not be able to continue governing.</p>
<p>Before the National Assembly began debating the bill, the cabinet held a meeting for two hours and forty-five minutes to discuss the opposition to the bill from some members of the Party. The Socialist Party's decision to oppose the bill was made at a meeting of its members of parliament. At the same time, the Finance Committee of the National Assembly rejected the bill by a vote of seventeen to fifteen, with seven abstentions. The debate in the National Assembly was originally scheduled to begin at 2:00 p.m., but was delayed until 10:00 p.m. because the cabinet meeting had not yet ended. The government motion to treat the bill as an emergency bill was passed by the National Assembly by a vote of 373 to 184, with all those opposed being Communist Party members. After one hour of debate, it was announced at 10:00 p.m. (7:00 a.m. Shanghai time on Wednesday) that the debate would be adjourned until 4:00 p.m. the following day. It is understood that the cabinet has scheduled a meeting for Wednesday morning, to be presided over by President Auriol, while the Socialist Party's parliamentary group has also scheduled another meeting for Wednesday morning, to be attended by Finance Minister Mayer and Foreign Minister Bidault. According to informed sources, the government's bill to establish a free gold market is expected to pass in the National Assembly, as the opposition of Socialist Party members is gradually subsiding. It is not yet known whether the government will make any amendments to accommodate the demands of Socialist Party officials. Before the debate begins on Wednesday, Prime Minister Schuman will address Socialist, Republican, and Radical Party members separately, explaining the significance of the government's bill.</p>
<h3>Next UN General Assembly to Be Held in Paris</h3>

<h3>UN Commission on Korea Awaits Soviet Response</h3>
<p>Koreans Present Opinions on Elections</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Seoul, 28th] The United Nations Commission on Korea decided today to extend the date of the general meeting to this Friday, hoping to receive a satisfactory response from the Soviet Union allowing the Commission to enter North Korea.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Lake Success, 27th] Yan Luyi, a representative of the South Korean Democratic Council, issued a statement today calling on the United Nations to recognize the upcoming elections in South Korea as a nationwide vote. He pointed out that the Koreans participating in this vote will account for at least two-thirds of the total population. After Korea becomes a member of the United Nations, the Korean people, with the support of the United Nations, can directly negotiate with the Soviet Union to seek national unification and liberation. Yan emphasized that the unification of Korea is not hopeless and its success depends on the rapid establishment of a Korean Republic in the mountains. It is expected that Koreans under Soviet rule will embrace their own government and will not support a foreign puppet government. The establishment of the Korean Republic can make the Soviet Union realize that handing over North Korea can establish peaceful relations with a truly democratic country.</p>
<h3>French Memorandum on German Western Unification Issue</h3>
<p>Saar Coal Production to Be Wholly Controlled by France</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 27th] French Ambassador to Britain Massigli submitted a memorandum to the British Foreign Office on Saturday, detailing the French government's views on the new economic and administrative measures in the British and American zones of Germany. Authoritative sources say that after the British Foreign Office studies the memorandum, they hope that the final plan for the new measures in the merged zone will be in line with French expectations. At the same time, the premiers of the merged zone are also scheduled to submit suggestions regarding the new measures to the British and American Commanders-in-Chief Robertson and Clay tomorrow.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 27th] It is reported that Britain and the United States have suggested to the European Coal Organization that coal production in the Saar region be gradually transferred to France. The Saar's annual coal production is 12 million tons. From the second quarter of 1949, all coal production will be transferred to France and will no longer be supplied to Germany. Officials believe that this is in fact recognizing French control over the Saar. The Soviet Union has previously refused to recognize this point.</p>
<h3>Churchill Strongly Advocates Convening a Three-Power Summit to Seek Understanding and Safeguard World Peace</h3>
<p>[United Press London, 27th] According to sources close to Churchill, he hopes to convene a round-table conference of the three major powers to reach a practical agreement among the world's major powers, to establish an understanding with the Soviet Union, and to "guarantee peace to the world." It is said that Churchill's speech in the House of Commons on the 23rd, requesting a "showdown" with the Soviet Union, actually called for another three-power summit (i.e., a meeting of Stalin, Truman, and Attlee). It is revealed that after his speech, Churchill told Conservative Party members that what he truly wanted was a round-table conference to bargain with Stalin. Furthermore, Churchill also hopes to obtain a decisive "yes or no" answer from Stalin regarding: Whether the Soviet Union's satellite states intend to cease their aid to Greek guerrillas and stop stirring up unrest along the Greek border. A firm guarantee that the Cominform will not expand beyond the "legitimate" scope of communist influence in Eastern Europe. A frank understanding with Stalin, with both East and West making straightforward declarations regarding the framework for lasting world peace they are willing to allow. If these three guarantees cannot be obtained from Stalin, Churchill believes that "some step" (unspecified) should be taken.</p>
<h3>The Biggest Obstacle to the Austrian Peace Treaty May Be Eliminated; Four Powers to Reopen Negotiations; Soviet Counter-Proposal of Four Points Still Requires Compromise</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse Washington, 27th] A State Department spokesman declared that the State Department is currently studying the Soviet Union's new proposals for the Austrian peace treaty, and the U.S. government will notify the three major powers within a few days to convene a new meeting of the four-power representatives to discuss these proposals.</p>
<p>[Reuters Vienna, 27th] Austrian Foreign Minister Gruber and Vice-Foreign Minister Walter Renner will travel to London within days to attend the talks on the Austrian peace treaty. The Austrian government also announced that it has received the Soviet Union's counter-proposal to the Austrian treaty and has reviewed it. Austrian Chancellor Figl expressed hope that the Austrian treaty could be quickly concluded to restore Austria's freedom.</p>
<p>[Reuters Vienna, 27th] Although Western Allied sources believe that the recent Soviet proposals regarding German assets in Austria represent progress toward the completion of the Austrian treaty, there are still four points that make their proposals unlikely to be accepted by the Western Allies. The Soviet Union originally demanded 800 million dollars in German asset rights, which has now been reduced to 352 million dollars, including: Oil rights valued at an estimated 135 million dollars—two-thirds of the rights to Austrian oil exploration, refining, and prospecting, valid for 50 years. Navigation rights valued at approximately 17 million dollars, including 25 percent of Austrian Danube River navigation rights, including control of downstream traffic. The remaining German assets are valued at approximately 200 million dollars. Western Allied sources point out that the Soviet Union's new proposals still present several difficulties: The aforementioned third item, the remaining German assets, must be converted into freely convertible currency totaling 200 million U.S. dollars, to be repaid by Austria within two years, a large amount of which must be provided by the United States. The obligations attached to German assets are not transferred to the Soviet Union until the date of transfer, which means that Austria will abandon its claims against Germany. In the event of disputes regarding the compliance with the German asset clauses, the countries concerned should resolve them through direct negotiations. Allied sources pointed out that this refusal to accept arbitration makes disputes difficult to resolve. Austrian sources believe that the Soviet Union has already agreed to pay Austria 200 million dollars for all other German assets besides oil and navigation rights, without haggling over the definition of other German assets, which can eliminate the biggest obstacle to the negotiation of the Austrian treaty.</p>
<h3>British-Italian Trade Agreement Signed</h3>

<h3>Eliminate Racial Discrimination; Marshall Plan Should be Expanded, Secretary of NAACP Says</h3>
<p>[Reuters Washington, 28th] Walter White, Secretary-General of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, told the Senate Foreign Relations Committee that the European Recovery Program should be expanded to Asia, Africa, and the Caribbean, and that the program should include all countries that can best assist the United States in helping the world. White said that hunger is the same whether it is suffered by white people or by yellow, brown, or black people. Countries receiving aid that have colonies must grant freedom to the people of their colonies, and it is foolish for the United States to help white European recovery while denying freedom to the people of colonies. White supremacy in Indonesia, Asia, and Africa has been destroyed forever, and any attempt to rebuild it will lead to a third world war.</p>

<p>[United Press Moscow, 28th] The Soviet government today issued an order prohibiting Soviet citizens from talking to foreigners, and designated Molotov's Ministry of Foreign Affairs as the only agency for contact with foreigners.

The Soviet Union's new decision was passed by the Supreme Soviet on the 16th of last month and published in the official gazette on the 27th. Soviet officials who receive written notices from foreigners should immediately forward them to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs or the Ministry of Foreign Trade. The procedures for contact between senior military officers and foreign attachés should be resolved separately by application to the Council of Ministers, meaning that the Council of Ministers can handle such cases individually.</p>
<h3>The United States Welcomes Chinese Ginger</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency New York, 28th] According to the Rich Company, an importer of seasonings, the first large shipment of Chinese ginger since the war recently arrived here from Hong Kong. A company spokesperson said that the quality of the Chinese ginger shipped this time is very good, and most American users are requesting regular and increased imports. Chinese ginger usually shipped to the United States comes in two forms: raw ginger, which is placed in salt water, and cooked ginger, which is placed in syrup; the latter is usually sold to gourmet stores and grocery stores. The Rich Company spokesperson continued that the United States needs large quantities of Chinese ginger to be imported. It is said that, apart from Britain, which can use Chinese ginger to make gingerbread, the United States is almost the second largest consumer of Chinese ginger.</p>

<h3>Copyright by North American Newspaper Alliance</h3>
<p>—Translated by the Editorial Department of this Newspaper</p>
<p>First Task After Entering the State Department</p>
<p>When I entered the State Department, our government was already preparing for the economic conference to be held in London. Preparatory meetings convened by the League of Nations had already been held in Geneva, and a complex agenda had been drafted. To prepare further, the President invited eleven countries with whom we had significant commercial relations to send representatives to Washington to discuss economic issues with us.</p>
<p>In a broadcast address on May 7, 1933, the President enumerated four goals of the talks. They were: reduction of armaments; reduction of trade barriers; stabilization of currency, so that commercial companies could sign contracts in advance; and the rebuilding of friendly relations and greater trust among all nations. In addition, the President and British Prime Minister MacDonald had held a special meeting on the war debt issue, without result.</p>
<p>I rarely participated in the war debt negotiations. The President entrusted that task to Assistant Secretary of State Moley (Raymond Moley). I believed that this issue involved the Treasury Department more than the State Department. In addition, I believed that the war debt issue had become a dead horse, and I was glad not to be too involved in it.</p>
<p>Around this time, Moley came to my apartment one morning. His expression was serious. He then told me that he had no intention of occupying my position as Secretary of State, contrary to the rumors circulating outside. After he left, I said to another visitor, "Moley at least has that thought in his mind." This was later confirmed in many ways, culminating in the London Conference.</p>
<p>In early May 1933, with the President's consent, I instructed Davis (Norman D. Davis), who was stationed in London at the time, to recommend a temporary tariff truce to the organizing committee of the London Economic Conference. The other countries initially opposed, but eventually accepted, albeit with various reservations and explanations.</p>
<p>On May 20th, Moley suddenly delivered a broadcast address without consulting me beforehand or afterward. In this address, he firmly denied that beneficial results could be obtained from the London Conference, and even if the conference was successful, it would be of no benefit. He said that foreign trade was of little importance. This address, broadcast to the entire United States as the actual position of the U.S. government, was clearly inconsistent with the position later adopted in the instructions given to the U.S. delegation sent to London. Moreover, this address was repeatedly rebroadcast in Europe, damaging the position of the U.S. delegation, especially my position. Under these circumstances, Moley should have been severely reprimanded by the President, but unfortunately, Mr. Roosevelt sometimes gave his close friends excessive freedom, without regard for his other friends.</p>
<p>Until the end of May, when the delegation I led was preparing to sail to London, the issue of reducing tariff barriers, which was about to be discussed in London, and the contradiction between the high tariff demands advocated by the National Recovery Administration and the Agricultural Adjustment Administration (especially the former) were only briefly discussed. I had a firm position on several purposes for attending the London Conference, one of the main ones being to reduce tariffs. Until we set off, there was no contrary action taken while we were crossing the ocean.</p>
<p>On May 30th, the President received the delegation, which included five members besides myself. The President had not consulted me beforehand when appointing these members.</p>
<p>Mr. Roosevelt gave us a memorandum outlining the policies to be followed in London. He asked us to immediately propose several major issues at the conference, namely: implementing a tariff truce during the conference; establishing general principles for a coordinated monetary and fiscal policy; abolishing foreign exchange restrictions; reaching a basic agreement on gradually eliminating artificial trade barriers and reducing tariffs; and agreeing on the production and distribution of several basic commodities. I had six draft resolutions covering these topics, ready to be proposed in London.</p>
<p>On May 31st, when I set sail from New York on the "President Roosevelt," I had a copy of the Reciprocal Trade Agreements Act in my bag. This bill was then on the President's desk. I expected to be able to show this bill to the other delegations in London to prove that our efforts to reduce tariffs were sincere and capable of being achieved. I hoped that when the conference reached a certain stage, the President could submit the bill to Congress and have it passed. However, developments made it impossible for me to mention it in the conference, only to use it as a reference.</p>
<p>During the voyage, I began a habit that I maintained for many years while traveling back and forth by ship to attend various conferences—that is, working hard on board. I never got seasick, which I was quite fortunate about. Even on the worst of days, I was able to read and write as I pleased. I often took long walks along the promenade deck as exercise, and occasionally played shuffleboard on the deck. Every day, I held several meetings with the representatives and experts who were with me on the ship, and kept in touch with Washington by radio.</p>
<p>I thought that of the three economic issues of interest to the major countries at the time, I could truly propose only one for discussion in London. These three issues were the war debt issue, the immediate stabilization of currency, and the reduction of trade and tariff barriers. The war debt issue was completely left out. The issue of currency stabilization was prepared for discussion, but was handled solely by experts from the Treasury Department and the Federal Reserve Bank. This matter was unrelated to the conference and was not within the scope of the U.S. delegation's work. The only remaining issue was the reduction of trade barriers.</p>
<p>At that time, I began to receive radio messages from Washington on the ship, conveying news of new legislation to raise—not lower—tariffs and implement import quotas, indicating that the President would not submit the Trade Agreements Act to Congress. After a week of sailing, I sent a radio telegram to the President on June 7th, saying:</p>
<p>"I hear that the President will not ask Congress to authorize the government to negotiate reciprocal commercial treaties based on mutual tariff concessions, with Congress retaining the right of veto, as proposed in the State Department's draft bill. I sincerely hope that this news is unfounded. After careful consideration, I feel that this approach, besides posing the most significant obstacle to the mission of our delegation attending the London Economic Conference, will delay the power to negotiate such commercial treaties until 1934, which is truly a major mistake."</p>
<p>The President replied, "I fully understand and agree with your anxiety about the actions to be taken on the tariff issue in the current Congress. However, in the last few days of Congress's near-closing, the situation is so tense that an immediate recess has become necessary. Otherwise, profit-sharing legislation, currency inflation, etc., may be forced through… Therefore, tariff-related legislation not only seems extremely inappropriate but also impossible to achieve.</p>
<p>"You have full authority to negotiate general reciprocal commercial treaties in London based on mutual tariff concessions. Furthermore, there is no reason why you cannot prepare to convene meetings in Washington to discuss definite reciprocal agreements with individual countries at length. Once Congress reconvenes, all these agreements, whether general or bilateral, can be submitted to Congress for approval."</p>
<p>This news was a terrible blow. It fundamentally dispelled one of my basic reasons for going to London. Originally, I hoped that with these basic points, I could achieve real results at the conference, so that countries—albeit gradually—could extricate themselves from the world depression. The fundamental difference between my position and the views advocated by the President in his telegram was this:</p>
<p>In my view, Congress must authorize the government to negotiate reciprocal trade agreements, including reducing tariffs, and to a certain extent, these agreements could take effect without Senate approval. This point seemed to be achieved in June 1934. However, the method proposed by the President was to negotiate tariff treaties on the old basis, which meant that they had to be submitted to the Senate for approval by a two-thirds majority. This method gave me neither help nor encouragement, because no U.S. Senate had ever approved a trade treaty negotiated by the government that advocated a major reduction in tariffs. Not to mention trade treaties negotiated without prior congressional authorization.</p>
<p>When I arrived in London, the delegations of other countries were already well aware of the extremely difficult situation of the U.S. delegation. On June 9th, the President announced that he would not submit tariff legislation to Congress. The other delegations immediately avoided discussing any treaties, because they believed that this would be indefinitely shelved in Congress.</p>
<p>On June 11th, the day before the opening of the London Conference, the President telegraphed me, saying, "Regarding reducing tariffs and eliminating trade barriers, you need not worry about the situation here. The final debates on domestic issues in Congress endanger the general debate on tariffs for our entire plan.</p>
<p>"I firmly support you, and what is said or done here will not hinder your efforts. There is no reason for your policy or my policy to change. And remember, if we can get the treaty signed, I can convene a special session of the Senate separately in the fall to consider approval."</p>
<p>But I had little hope here. The President supported me verbally, but if I wanted to achieve anything in London, I also needed to be supported by action.</p>
<p>But one extremely important fact should not be ignored, which is that there were vast differences of opinion among almost all countries regarding an acceptable method of reducing trade barriers. Britain was moving towards a quota system. Certain gold standard countries like France, Belgium, the Netherlands, and Switzerland demanded temporary currency stabilization before considering reducing tariffs. Other countries proposed other preconditions, such as war debt relief.</p>
<p>Never has a conference been as entangled as this one. For most of the time, it seemed to be groping in the dark. Here, provocateurs, agitators, perverse figures, and cunning critics could have a field day.</p>
<p>These conflicting views and attitudes expressed at the London Conference also extended to the members of the U.S. delegation. There were members of the U.S. delegation who advocated high tariffs, such as Senator Pittman. Opinions on the issue of currency stabilization, and indeed on all other issues, differed greatly. It was a mistake for the head of a delegation attending a world conference to have no opportunity to consult with the President beforehand on the selection of all members—or to allow delegation members to have such a clear impression—and its misfortune was rarely greater than this. Because in this way, some members lacked a sense of loyalty and cooperation, while other members expressed open contempt. This was my experience.</p>

<h3>City Council and Four Other Groups Host Joint Banquet for North China Petition Delegation, Council Speaker Represents Citizens to Express Concern</h3>
<p>[Our Own Report] Yesterday at 6 PM, the Shanghai Municipal City Council, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, the Local Association, and the Industrial Association jointly hosted a banquet at the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company restaurant to welcome the North China Petition Delegation and express their hospitality. Attendees included delegation representatives Shi Zizhou, Xu Huidong, Li Zhuchen, and Ji Aochuan, as well as Council Speaker Pan, Xu Jiyin, Du Yuesheng (represented by Yan Xing), Wu Yunxu, Mayor Wu, Fang Zhi, Wu Kaixian, Liu Gongyun, Yang Guanbei, Cheng Cangbo, Shu Yunzhang, and Wu Weijing, totaling over a hundred people. The grand gathering lasted until 8:45 PM.</p>
<p>Council Speaker Pan first delivered a speech, stating that he had three impressions of the petition delegation's trip: The delegation's trip has achieved considerable results, demonstrating that the government understands the needs and expectations of the people, and is considering adopting them for implementation, which is a welcome phenomenon. The delegation's requests are not limited to North China or Tianjin, but are relevant to the entire country. The various relevant departments of the central government in Beijing have been sincerely discussing and considering measures to facilitate the flow of goods, demonstrating that the government and the people are fully cooperating in economic policy, which is a good start for the country and the people. Shanghai is still able to live and work in peace under this difficult situation, thanks to the brave soldiers who have fought to suppress the bandits and defend the area, and thanks to the people in the front (such as North China) who have worked hard to build and develop production. The people of North China suffer more than the people of Shanghai, and the people of Shanghai express their deep concern. He hoped that the gentlemen of the delegation would convey the small token of concern from the people of Shanghai to the people of North China.</p>
<p>Subsequently, Xu Jiyin, Chairman of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce and the Industrial Association, and Wu Yunxu respectively read written welcoming speeches, expressing deep admiration for the delegation members who had traveled arduously to Beijing to petition on behalf of tens of millions of people in North China. Zhang Xingyan also represented Local Association Chairman Du to pay tribute to the delegation.</p>
<p>Delegation representative Shi Zizhou briefly stated that the petition to Beijing had achieved considerable results, thanks in large part to the support of all sectors of Shanghai. He was deeply grateful for the banquet invitation and hoped that Shanghai could provide more guidance to North China as an elder brother, and that they would implement the instructions in the future. Xu Huidong briefly stated that the North China political and military authorities have a governance vision of two parts politics, three parts military, and five parts economy, which shows that economic factors are an important part of stabilizing the overall situation in North China. Therefore, all economic problems in North China must be resolved reasonably. Finally, Yang Guanbei explained the external transportation price and sales situation of fine flour in Shanghai. The meeting adjourned at 8:45 PM.</p>
<h3>Petition Delegation to Fly to Peiping Today</h3>

<h3>Extravagant Farewell Event at the Tianchan Stage: Recovered Soldiers Return to the Front Lines, A Convoy of 28 Vehicles Rolls Grandly, Residents Along the Way Light Firecrackers and Cheer</h3>
<p>"Miss Shanghai" Wang Yunmei Represents the People in Presenting a Banner to the Warriors</p>
<p>[Our Own Report] Yesterday, various sectors of the city held a grand meeting at the Tianchan Stage to bid farewell to recovered soldiers returning to the front lines and to express their appreciation. Mayor Wu, Council Speaker Pan, Chairman Fang, as well as the Commander of the Garrison District, Fu Zhengmo, Commander of the Wusong Fortress, Shao Baichuan, Commander of the Air Force, Wang Weimin, Chairman of the City Federation of Trade Unions, Shui Xiangyun, and representative of the Women's Association, Lu Huimin, all attended and delivered speeches. The atmosphere at the meeting was unprecedentedly enthusiastic. The meeting lasted from 11:30 AM to 2:30 PM.</p>
<p>At 7 AM, a white jeep, adorned with a red banner and broadcasting "Shao Kuai Le Troupe's Comedic Songs," slowly led the way. Behind it followed a long convoy of 28 military vehicles from the port command, fully loaded with over three thousand recovered soldiers from the 20th and 101st Rear Hospitals. The convoy departed from the Army Friends Society on Wusong Road and passed through North Sichuan Road, Tianhougong Bridge, Beijing Road, Xizang Road, and Fuzhou Road before arriving at the Tianchan Stage. Residents along the way and stores on both sides set off firecrackers to express their respect and waved to cheer the recovered soldiers on the trucks. A wounded soldier from the 20th Rear Hospital told a reporter: "For the first time in my life, I was moved to tears. It is already a disgrace for a soldier not to die on the battlefield. What does a little injury matter? The country has treated us too well, and the people have moved us even more."</p>
<p>Work Hard to Eliminate the Communists, Persevere and Strive On</p>
<p>The meeting was presided over by Mayor Wu, who, in addition to expressing the respect of all sectors of Shanghai to all recovered soldiers, pointed out that the current situation in China, where the people cannot live and work in peace, is caused by the Communist bandits. He hoped that the recovered soldiers would return to the front lines and continue to use their previous spirit to work hard to eliminate the communists. Council Speaker Pan represented the five million citizens of the city in bidding farewell to all the soldiers, and said: "The communist rebellion is not simply a bandit problem, it has an international background. The communist bandits sell out the nation and are willing to be the vanguard of foreign invaders. They are no longer Chinese nationals. Shanghai's ability to live in peace depends entirely on you going back to the front lines and smashing the communist bandits' conspiracy. We must also use this shout of farewell to awaken those who are living in a dreamlike state." Director Fang of the Municipal Party Headquarters said: "If the communist bandits are not eliminated for one day, the country cannot be built for one day, the people cannot live in peace for one day, and China cannot be stable for one day, which means that the world cannot be peaceful for one day. Your success in suppressing the bandits and achieving success in the front lines will not only make you national heroes of China, but also heroes of the world."</p>
<p>A Perfect Shot of Heroes and Beauties</p>
<p>After representatives from all sectors delivered their speeches, the microphone announced that "Miss Shanghai" Wang Yunmei would represent the citizens of Shanghai in presenting a banner to the two rear hospitals. Recovered soldiers' representatives An Yin and Zhuo Jingliu stepped forward to receive the banner, and the presentation ceremony was completed amidst music and applause. Photography reporters from various newspapers and cameramen from the Central Film Studio flocked to capture this "heroes and beauties" shot. The entertainment program included the "Big Doll's Big Tonic Pot"; singing by Misses Luo Ling, Huang Lifang, Kang Hua, and Ye Minzhi; soft acrobatics by overseas Chinese Miss Zhang Baoyu; magic by the Shen family troupe; and finally, the famous actors Ma Lianliang and Zhang Junqiu performing the Peking opera "You Long Xi Feng" (Roaming Dragon and Playing with the Phoenix). The entire performance lasted for over three hours.</p>
<h3>Strengthening Meteorological Reporting: Beijing Headquarters Relocated to Shanghai, Decision to Merge Operations</h3>
<p>[Our Own Report from Nanjing, 28th] In order to ensure the safety of aviation and navigation and to strengthen meteorological reporting, the Central Meteorological Bureau has decided to relocate its Meteorological Headquarters from Beijing to Shanghai and merge it with the Shanghai Meteorological Observatory, which was originally established by the Central Meteorological Bureau. The merged unit will begin meteorological reporting operations in February. The station will have departments for management, forecasting, air routes, and marine affairs. The Director-General will be Lu Jian, and Cheng Chunshu will be the Deputy Director-General. Currently, the station has sent personnel to Shanghai for arrangements. The headquarters will be located on Zhongzheng West Road in Shanghai, the air route department will be located at Longhua Airport, and the marine department will be located on the Bund.</p>
<h3>Police Bureau Launches Comprehensive Inspection: Carry Your ID When Going Out</h3>
<p>[Our Own Report] As the Lunar New Year is approaching, the Municipal Police Bureau has decided to implement a comprehensive inspection from today until the 9th of next month to crack down on the seasonal crime wave. The timing and frequency will be decided on an ad hoc basis, but will be at least once per day. The targets include pedestrians, alleys, shantytowns, vehicles, ships, hotels, brothels, and public places. According to a responsible person from the Police Bureau yesterday, citizens are advised to carry their identification cards with them during this period to avoid trouble during inspections.</p>
<h3>A Major Combination in the Cultural World: The Artists Association Held its Annual Meeting Yesterday</h3>
<p>Target Reality, Urge Intensified Efforts to Suppress the Rebellion</p>
<p>[Our Own Report] The Shanghai Artists Association held its first annual meeting at the Zhapu Road Cultural Hall at 2 PM yesterday. Over six hundred members attended, including Yu Wen, Wang Jinshan, Liu Haisu, Zheng Wuchang, He Tianjian, Lu Danlin, Yan Duhe, and Shi Chongpeng. City Councilor Pan, the Chairman of the City Council, and Director Fang of the City Party Headquarters also attended the meeting. At the beginning of the meeting, Chairman Yu Wen reported that the Shanghai Artists Association was established last year, and in the past year, the number of members has increased to more than five hundred, symbolizing a major combination in Shanghai's cultural world. In the past, some people believed that artists only need to diligently pursue their personal art and do not need to consider social responsibility, but this idea is not entirely correct. What day is today? The communist party, which betrays the country and harms the people, is causing trouble everywhere. Not to mention the widespread war in the north, the people only dozens of miles away from Shanghai cannot live and work in peace. If the communist party comes to Shanghai, can we still hold meetings here? Can we still maintain a minimum standard of living? Therefore, in the future, the artists should unanimously target reality, and continuously strike at the Communist Party in terms of the content and ideas of their works. Every word and action should be coordinated with the suppression of the rebellion and the building of the country, so as to increase the strength of the country and overcome the difficult situation.</p>
<p>Director Fang of the City Party Headquarters then delivered a speech, believing that the purpose of studying art is to seek the beautification of life, society, and the country. When the entire society reaches a state of beautification, phenomena such as corruption and darkness will have no way to occur. Therefore, he hoped that the artists would fulfill their responsibility as pillars of the country. Secondly, in the current period of mobilizing to suppress the rebellion, soldiers on the front lines are fighting bloody battles, and people in the rear should each stay at their posts, using their hands or their mouths to work hard to promote national policies, so as to quell the bandit rebellion and restore unity and peace.</p>
<h3>To Seek Social Stability, Art Should Be Promoted</h3>
<p>After Mr. Fang finished speaking, Council Speaker Pan arrived in time. The council speaker first strongly criticized the common misconception that during times of world turmoil and material hardship, it is inappropriate to talk about art. He argued that art is a necessary cultivation of life, and that humans are different from animals because humans have an innate ability to love art and appreciate art. People whose thoughts and lives can reach a state of beautification will be able to transcend the material environment. Even if life is more difficult, their works will be more outstanding. There are countless examples of this throughout history, both in China and abroad. The reason why today's society is turbulent and uneasy is also due to the lack of artistic cultivation of the general public. Therefore, to seek social stability, promoting art is the way to solve the problem at its root. He deeply hoped that the artists would not only seek progress in their personal works, but also take on the responsibility of enlightening the innate aesthetic psychology of their compatriots. This is one point. Secondly, modern science has developed to the point where the world is one family, but spiritual thought is far behind. The reason for this is the extreme nationalism of people like Hitler, Mussolini, and Tojo Hideki, and the extreme classism of people like Stalin. Nothing hinders the development of human thought more than this. Only the thinking of us Chinese people, the so-called "governing the country and pacifying the world," is most suitable for the trend of the times. Therefore, he hoped that the art world would take on the mission of promoting this kind of thinking from the art field first, so that human spirit can receive a new baptism and move towards the world of great harmony.</p>
<p>Finally, Mr. Yan Duhe, the director, delivered a speech, encouraging artists to be more closely connected with society and do more work that is beneficial to society, so as to popularize and democratize art.</p>
<h3>Two Papers Read, Eight Proposals Passed</h3>
<p>Two papers were then read, one by Liu Shi, "Research on Modern French Painting," and one by Xu Shiqi, "Reasons for the Decline of Chinese Figure Painting."</p>
<p>Finally, the directors and supervisors were re-elected, and the proposals were discussed and passed: To send representatives to request Mayor Wu to allocate funds early to build an art museum. To organize an art visit group to visit Taiwan and Hong Kong. To organize art lectures to study and expand art movements. To hold a joint charity exhibition of the Shanghai art world to raise funds for the art museum. In coordination with the national art movement, the Shanghai Artists Association will be renamed the Shanghai Artists Association. To send a telegram to the Central Government in the name of the conference, urging intensified efforts to mobilize and suppress the rebellion. To send a telegram to Chairman Chiang to pay tribute. To send a telegram to Zhang Daofan, Chairman of the National Artists Association of China, to pay tribute. Finally, the meeting was adjourned after a screening of Cathay Film's "Love, Love" film.</p>
<h3>Lottery Decided to Proceed as Scheduled: Last Struggle of the Dance Industry</h3>
<p>[Our Own Report] Yesterday afternoon at 4 PM, the Social Bureau summoned Sun Hongyuan, Chairman of the Dance Hall Industry Association, to the bureau for talks. Yuan Wenzhang, the Fourth Section Chief, informed him that in order to implement the ban on dancing, the Social Bureau will hold a lottery at the bureau at 3 PM on the 31st to determine which half of the dance halls should close by the end of March. At that time, the dance hall industry is also expected to send representatives to participate. Sun Hongyuan said that he was unable to decide whether or not to participate in the lottery and would need to wait for the dance industry's investors and dancers to hold a general meeting on the morning of the 31st to discuss and decide. The ban on dancing will have little impact on the investors, as the original site of the dance hall can be converted into a movie theater or a shopping mall. However, the consequences of dancers and workers losing their jobs are worrying. Therefore, they intend to go to Nanjing again to petition and attempt a final rescue. Director Yuan informed him that the local government has done its best to ban dancing in the city. The decision to hold a lottery on the 31st will stand. If the dance hall industry does not send representatives to participate at that time, the lottery will still proceed as scheduled.</p>
<h3>Annual Bonus for Light Bulb Industry Resolved: Huade Factory Once Slowed Down Work</h3>
<p>[Our Own Report] The Social Bureau's Year-End Bonus Processing Committee is scheduled to hold its third meeting at 3 PM this afternoon to discuss the closing of the committee and the handling of outstanding cases.</p>
<p>The issue of year-end bonuses for workers in the light bulb manufacturing industry has been resolved after mediation by Shui Xiangyun, Chairman of the General Trade Union, and representatives of the Electrical Industry Association. It is stipulated that 25 days of wages will be paid, based on the December 1947 index. In addition, Huade Light Bulb Factory once slowed down work because the investors only agreed to pay 20 days, but work has resumed after persuasion.</p>
<p>The year-end bonus issue for occupational workers in the Western clothing, fashion, sewing, and leather shoe industries was previously decided by the Labor-Management Evaluation Subcommittee to persuade both labor and management to reach a resolution. Yesterday, workers sent representatives to petition the Social Bureau. Zhao Banfu, the Deputy Director of the Year-End Bonus Processing Committee, said that he would urge the investors to reply and seek a resolution as soon as possible.</p>
<h3>Beijing Shoe Store "Starvation Strike": Federation to Send Personnel for Investigation</h3>
<p>[Our Own Report] Thirty-five workers at the No. 3 workshop of the Beijing Shoe Store at No. 48 Baokang Lane, Linsen Middle Road, have been on "starvation strike" since the afternoon of the 26th. According to workers, they had previously agreed with the investors that the index for the part of the base salary above 30 yuan would not be discounted from the seventh to the thirtieth day of the twelfth lunar month, and that working hours would be extended. Now the investors are not fulfilling the agreement. After unsuccessful negotiations, they are implementing a "starvation strike." The Labor-Management Evaluation Committee sent personnel yesterday to investigate the incident, and it will be handled by the Social Bureau.</p>

<h3>56 Fish Merchants Jointly Submit Petition: Opposing the Cancellation of the Shanghai Fish Market</h3>
<p>Regarding the case of Lin Chengzong, a standing director of the Shanghai Fish Merchants Association, going to Beijing to petition the Ministry of Agriculture to request the cancellation of the fish market, the Fish Industry Association said that there were many twists and turns behind the matter. 56 members of the association, including Yongyuan Fish Bank, have jointly submitted a petition to the Executive Yuan and the Ministry of Agriculture to state the truth. It is also stated that Lin Chengzong's petition to Beijing on behalf of the Fish Industry Association, claiming that the 21st board of directors and supervisors meeting decided to request the cancellation of the Shanghai Fish Market to reduce the pain of the industry, was an individual attempt by Lin Chengzong. As a result, Jin Chuxiang, the association's director, was constrained and unable to achieve his ambitions, and resigned in anger. Furthermore, regarding the cancellation of the fish market, most of the directors and supervisors believe that the Shanghai Fish Market was established based on a government order, and members have no right to make wild statements about the issue of survival or abolition, so they strongly advocate caution and express dissent. In addition, the association has no record of Lin Chengzong's petition to Beijing, and although the petition states that there are more than 40 fish firms that have signed it, it is impossible to know whether there are non-members included. Lin Chengzong has not publicly disclosed the contents of the petition, which is clearly a separate attempt by Lin Chengzong under the guise of the Fish Industry Association, so it is unanimously denied.</p>
<h3>Peiping-Shanghai Air Transport Drug Trafficking Case: Initial Public Trial of Ten Defendants</h3>
<p>Li Jianfei's Confessions are Inconsistent</p>
<p>[Our Own Report] In the major case of air transport drug trafficking between Peiping and Shanghai, in which more than 90 catties of morphine were seized, the Criminal Court of the District Court held its first public trial yesterday, presided over by Judge Shen Tianbao. Because there were many defendants in the case, the trial will be held over two days, yesterday and today. Yesterday, the defendants who impersonated a colonel officer, Li Jianfei, Haizi, (also known as Mai Changde), Jia Renfa, Kong Fanzhen, Bu Longfu, Danqing, Ma Xueyi, Mai Lizhi, Chen Jixi, and Mai Jinbao, were questioned.</p>
<p>Li Jianfei first confessed that in November of last year, he and his friend Zhang Guangyu flew from Peiping to Shanghai on the same plane. The morphine was hidden on Zhang's body. Because he was unemployed, he asked Zhang to introduce him to a job. Zhang agreed to introduce him to the Ministry of National Defense. Before it was successful, Zhang advised him to transport drugs, with a reward of 20 million yuan each time. The Colonel Staff Officer certificate from the Second Department of the Ministry of National Defense was also given by Zhang. It is unknown whether it was forged. He does not know who the backstage boss behind the drug trafficking is. He does not know who owns the more than 80 catties of drugs seized in Nanshi. He met Mai Renfa on the plane and did not know him in the past. Mai Renfa confessed that he is related to Mai Changde and met Li Jianfei on the plane. The ten taels of gold and 80 million yuan in cash that he was carrying were not for the purchase of drugs. The last time he went to Beiping, he was entrusted by Mai Changde's wife to take the luggage to Henan, which did not contain drugs. He did not carry morphine on his leg when he came to Shanghai from Peiping. The other defendants all denied trafficking in drugs. After the questioning, all the defendants were returned to custody and will be questioned again today.</p>
<h3>Accused of Embezzling Rationed Goods: Ward Chief and Others Summoned for Interrogation</h3>
<p>[Our Own Report] The ward chief of the 8th Ward of the 14th District of Zhabei, Fu Daosheng, and the district people's representative, Yu Luolin, were sued by the ward residents for embezzling civilian rationed rice. Yesterday, they were interrogated by the District Attorney's Office, and the plaintiffs' representatives Zheng Chaozhen, Wang Chengfu, Xu Renjie, Zhang Yiming, and Liu Chunshan, as well as the defendants Fu and Yu, were present. The main points of the case are: The rationed rice for civilians in each ward should be one dou for a large family and five sheng for a small family, but Ward Chief Chuan only distributed two sheng and five he for a large family, and did not distribute anything for a small family. There are a total of 14,000 households in the ward, and about 700 shi of rice were embezzled. Oil and sugar are not distributed according to the number of households, and even when they are distributed, they are discounted by 20% to 30%. Each household is charged 2,000 yuan for baojia (mutual responsibility system) fees, without issuing receipts, and the accounts are never made public. After the prosecutor finished questioning, he ordered the defendants and plaintiffs to return, and the interrogation will be held again at a later date.</p>
<h3>Cao Hang Township Murder Case: Transferred to District Attorney's Office for Investigation</h3>
<p>[Our Own Report] The Shanghai County Government yesterday transferred the case of Jin Jiasheng, a carpenter from Jinjiatang, the 1st Ward of Cao Hang Township, Shanghai County, being murdered by his wife, Zhou, to the District Attorney's Office for investigation. The case occurred around the 18th of this month. Because Jin had another lover outside and did not care about the family's livelihood, Zhou was extremely angry and bribed her neighbors Jin Cai and Jin Xuesheng to kill Jin in the middle of the night and bury him under the pigsty. Zhou pretended that Jin had disappeared. After investigation by the township office, the incident came to light. The District Attorney's Office had previously sent personnel to the township to examine the body.</p>

<h3>Two Enthusiastic Readers Generously Donate Large Sums to Support Education</h3>
<p>Yesterday was the seventeenth day of the "Reader's Education Assistance Fund" micro-donation campaign, and we received new encouragement and two large donations. One reader personally came to our office and said: "Reading the words in Shen Bao over the past few days appealing for donations for impoverished students has deeply moved me. When I was young, I dropped out of school because of poverty, so I can personally experience the pain of being out of school! Now I am the owner of several yarn factories, and I have enough power to help a few poor students. Today I brought 50 million yuan to donate to the 'Reader's Education Assistance Fund,' but please do not publish my name, just write 'Anonymous' in the donation report."</p>
<p>Another anonymous person also came to this office at 2 pm yesterday to donate 60 million yuan to the "Reader's Education Assistance Fund," saying: This is a birthday gift from relatives and friends to an old lady. Considering the large number of out-of-school youths, they decided to donate all the savings to the "Education Assistance Fund." The appeal of the past ten days has finally achieved considerable results. Yesterday alone, we received 110 million yuan in donations, setting a new record for "Reader's Education Assistance Fund" donations. However, we hope that people in society who possess wealth can emulate the generous actions of these two "anonymous" individuals, actively donate, and enable this education assistance movement to achieve its expected goals as soon as possible.</p>

<h3>Difficulties for Motorized Junk Merchants Association; Preparing to Sue Shipping Industry</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] The motorized junk merchants in this city requested to join the Shipping Industry Trade Association but were rejected. After several mediations by the Social Affairs Bureau, no results were obtained, and the stalemate has lasted for more than ten months. A few days ago, the motorized junk merchants asked a lawyer to publish an advertisement on their behalf, appealing to the Ministry of Transportation, the Ministry of Social Affairs, the Social Affairs Bureau, and the Shipping Administration Bureau. According to news from the Shipping Administration Bureau yesterday, they have not received official documents regarding the motorized junk merchants' advertisement, so they are not convenient to intervene. As for the matter of motorized junks joining the shipping industry association, there has long been an order to the association, explaining that motorized junks belong to ships and should be allowed to join the association. According to the motorized junk merchants, if the shipping industry association makes no further statement, they will file a lawsuit.</p>
<p>The Fumin Shipping Company's Great Wall express ship, which specializes in the Tianjin-Shanghai line, has a very high speed because it was originally converted from an escort warship. On the 25th of this month, the ship sailed from Tianjin to Shanghai. Due to the severe cold in Beiyang, the ice was very thick, and the seawater was particularly shallow, causing it to run aground outside Dagu Port. Later, the ship used wireless radio to notify the Tianjin branch, and the China Merchants Bureau sent a tugboat to rescue it. It is now known that the ship has been released from the shoal and safely sailed to Shanghai. It is expected to arrive at 5 pm today.</p>

<p>[Report from this newspaper] The US Army Advisory Group's engineering office at the intersection of Gangche, Shan Lu, and Dalian Road was burglarized at midnight on the 19th, losing machinery, motors, wires, and other items worth over 200 million yuan. The group's representative, an American named English (resident at 1226 Xin Zha Road), reported the information to the Municipal Police Bureau.

<h3>Brand New Customs Gold Unit Notes; Four Thieves Arrested After Using Stolen Money</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] The Lianglu Police Department recently arrested a large number of habitual thieves, including the famous giant thief Ma Junjie, also known as Sun Xiaoshan. Sun is one of the main criminals of the "Four Famous Mountains" theft gang. On the morning of the 21st of this month, at about 4 am, the 11th train was traveling through Wuxi and Suzhou when a passenger suddenly discovered that 160 million yuan had been stolen from the 400 million yuan in legal tender they were carrying.

<h3>Voice from Yanbei; A Panoramic View of the Ancient City of Datong</h3>
<p>[Airmail report from Beiping on the 20th] Datong, strategically located outside Yanmen Pass, has been a battleground for those vying for power since ancient times. Not to mention twenty years ago, the Mongolian cavalry from the desert and the agricultural people inside the Great Wall had already stained the ancient city with the wind, blood, and rain. Even in modern times, the gain or loss of Datong is related to the safety of the world. During the Ming Dynasty, the three prefectures of Daning, Xuanhua, and Datong were located outside the Great Wall to defend the northern frontier. After the loss of Daning, the right wing was damaged, leading to the Tumu Crisis of Emperor Yingzong of Ming. Fortunately, the Datong elite troops on the left wing provided eastern support, reversing the dangerous situation. At the end of the Ming Dynasty, Li Zicheng also captured Datong first before daring to compete for the capital. During the Anti-Japanese War, the Japanese army also held Datong tightly in their hands, watching over Chahar and Suiyuan. After the victory, Datong, the gateway to northern Shanxi and a vulnerable place for bandits in Chahar and Suiyuan, also experienced many changes. At the beginning of Japan's surrender, Fu Zuoyi's cavalry advanced rapidly into Datong. At that time, Quan Liu, commander of the Twelfth War Zone, was outside the inner Great Wall. Later, Chu Xichun, under the orders of Yan Xishan, led his troops to return to northern Shanxi, and the twelve counties outside Yanmen Pass were allowed to return to the jurisdiction of the Taiyuan Pacification Headquarters. Last August, the Chinese Communists also wanted to remove this nail, connecting Chahar and Suiyuan. They gathered more than 50,000 people, changed commanders four times, and besieged the city for 45 days. Finally, due to the support of the Fu troops and the battle of Jining, the siege of Datong was lifted. Afterwards, this continuously developed into the Battle of Zhangjiakou, transforming the entire military situation in North China.</p>
<p>A Kite with a Broken String</p>
<p>Datong is 400 li from Taiyuan. Since the Tongpu Railway between Huairen and Xin County was cut off, it has been isolated outside Yanmen Pass, becoming a kite with a broken string in Taiyuan's hands. Zuoyun and Youyu, which are related to the stability of southern Suiyuan, are stationed with troops from Zhang's Suiyuan Pacification Headquarters. The Ping-Sui Railway's northern Shanxi corridor, which connects Chahar and Suiyuan, is also stationed with considerable troops.</p>
<p>In order to continuously strike Yanbei, Yan Xishan also established two institutions. On the military side, there was the Taiyuan Pacification Headquarters Datong Command, originally commanded by Chu Xichun, representing Yan to govern the military affairs of Yanbei. After the successful conclusion of the Battle of Datong, Chu retired and drifted away. Afterwards, the Taiyuan Pacification Headquarters announced that Yu Zhenhe, the former military leader of a certain army, would succeed Chu.</p>
<p>On the political side, the Shanxi Provincial Government also established the Jinbei Administrative Office in Datong, governing the eighth and tenth special commissioner districts of Yanbei and the eleventh special commissioner district of Hequ, totaling 19 counties. Director Meng Xiangzhi is one of Yan's brains trust, with a careful mind and skilled in speech. He is quite capable of handling his difficult work.</p>
<p>A Breath of Yan Xishan</p>
<p>Taiyuan's political pattern has changed somewhat in Yanbei. For example, the vigorous integration of soldiers and farmers in the 25 counties around Taiyuan has not spread to Yanmen Pass. It is said that Yan Xishan instructed that unless more than half of the people automatically request it, the 13 counties in Yanbei do not need to implement the integration of soldiers and farmers. Although there are many soldiers in Jinbei, it is clear that they have not exceeded half of the strong men.</p>
<p>However, it is still full of the atmosphere of Taiyuan, just not very strong.</p>
<p>Yan Xishan's political style and tactics also have their Jinbei version. For example, the current slogan popular in Datong is: In military affairs, oppose disturbing the people; in politics, oppose corruption; in the economy, oppose exploitation; in life, oppose inequality; in thought, oppose left and right leaning... and so on. Administrative Director Meng Xiangzhi told reporters that the Jinbei military and political institutions are now concentrating their efforts on the following tasks: Actively collecting food to prepare for the defense of Datong again. Strengthening city defense works to compensate for the lack of troops. Rushing to build roads, the highway from Zhangjiakou to Datong has been completed. Eliminating disguised elements. Establishing struggle committees at all levels. Whatever is lacking, struggle for it. Small things like not being punctual, big things like work paralysis... are all objects of struggle. Struggle against yourself, struggle against others, groups struggle against groups, to maintain political clarity and efficiency. For example, the sixth discussion meeting of the Datong County Struggle Committee decided to submit a written struggle against Datong County Chief E Mingxian for not attending the Struggle Committee three times and not asking for leave, "to correct his unprogressive performance and promote his thorough transformation."</p>
<p>The Grain War</p>
<p>The military grain for 19,000 people in Jinbei has caused the people of Datong to rack their brains. The grain department's purchase price for military grain is as slow as an old ox cart, while the active market price of grain is always as fast as a galloping horse. The grain price issued by the Yanbei military grain from April to June to purchase in the market would be short 10,454 bags, which would increase the burden on the people by 15 billion. Now, military grain is about to be purchased again. Calculating it, purchasing with the issued price is still a huge number short. The local people are complaining that the grain department set the issued price too low and issued it too slowly. However, the chief of the 38th station, Chi Yao, was very clear-headed. Based on the grain price at the time, after submitting the request, the grain department did not discount it at all and quickly allocated the funds. However, when purchasing, the grain price suddenly jumped. Even with half wheat and half millet, it would increase by an average of one-quarter. Who is to blame?</p>
<p>The problem is not limited to this. According to government regulations, soldiers should eat white flour, but Yanmen Pass is the hometown of wheat and millet. Wheat can only be sought from Chahar and Suiyuan, and the grain shortage in Peiping and Tianjin is severe. Suiyuan and Chahar are also trying to make their military and civilian food self-sufficient. Even with banknotes, it is not easy to turn them into something to relieve hunger. In order to solve the grain problem in many ways, the authorities mobilized local armed forces to launch grain-grabbing battles day and night. It is said that the results are quite impressive. All these mixed grains are enough to supply the military and civilians for half a year.</p>
<p>A World of Refugees</p>
<p>The city of Datong is now home to six county chiefs. In addition to the Datong county chief, the other five county chiefs from Shanyin, Shuoxian, and other counties have established exile governments in Datong City. Most of the exile county government buildings have two signs hanging in front of them. One sign, needless to say, is the government of a certain county. The other sign is the refugee shelter of a certain county. Because the county territory has been lost and there is nothing to do, they can only accommodate some refugees. In reality, due to limited funds, they cannot afford to accommodate them, so those shelters only allow newly arrived refugees to settle down there briefly.</p>
<p>Datong is a city with more than 100,000 people. According to the report of the Datong County Chief, refugees account for 50,000 of them. There are only two institutions for rescuing refugees: one is the relief center, which can accommodate 400 refugees, and the other is the relief branch, which can accommodate 70 refugees. In the past, the UNRRA branch also distributed relief supplies to refugees. Although it could not solve the problem, now that UNRRA has been cancelled, even that cup of water has disappeared. The cold wind from the north is tightening, and the famine wind in North China is intensifying. How will the millions of God's children without clothes or food rely on their own efforts to survive the long winter?</p>
<p>For the refugee problem, the local military and political authorities are also experiencing conflicting feelings. They are happy that the refugees' return shows their allegiance to the government, but they are worried that their city cannot control enough villages and obtain food sources, and that each refugee cannot bring their own warehouse from their own village or small town (assuming they have one).</p>
<p>Not far from Datong is the Kouquan coal mine. After 4 pm every day, the local security is in a chaotic state. The famous Zhigang Stone Buddha is also avoided by pedestrians, which is even more desolate.</p>
<p>Local military authorities all told reporters that they hope the central government will attach importance to Datong's strategic position, increase funding for city defense and replace ordnance, and request to increase Datong's troop strength, which is secondary. One major general said: "We want to increase Datong's defense power by strengthening fortifications and strengthening equipment!" (Special Correspondent Zhang Jianmei)</p>
<h3>Yang Yinlin Died in Prison; On His Deathbed, He Confessed to His Accomplice Lu Xiaodi; Seven 79 Rifles Seized at His Address</h3>
<p>[Report from Qingpu on the 27th] Yang Yinlin, the chief of the bandit army, "Instructor of the Qingsong Brigade" and "Captain of the South Mobile Team on the Qinghu Road," was captured by the authorities in the middle of this month and died in prison a few days ago. According to his confession on his deathbed, his accomplice Lu Xiaodi had seven rifles hidden in his home (located in Diaotang, Section 7, Longfeng Township). The authorities sent a team to search the address, and the bandit Lu surrendered immediately. Seven 79 rifles were found in the thatched roof of his house. The person and the rifles have now been sent to the county.</p>
<h3>Free Voting, Fair Competition: A Glimpse of the Election Education Movement in Nanhui</h3>
<p>[Nanhui 27th Dispatch] Taking advantage of this legislative election, Nanhui has launched a widespread election education movement, which is truly an innovation in county-level elections in China. The process of this matter is as follows: In the past, elections in local areas were often manipulated by the township heads in charge. The public not only didn't see the ballots, but even didn't know there was an election at all. At the same time, the township heads, because they controlled</p>
<p>large numbers of votes</p>
<p>would wait to be bought. If a candidate wanted to obtain votes, he had to negotiate terms with them. This also created a kind of election broker, running between candidates and local officials who held the votes, negotiating and connecting, creating a smoky atmosphere and generating many unnecessary disputes. "Elections" became "election disasters." What democracy could be talked about? Progressive people in Nanhui knew that this was an unreasonable phenomenon and were determined not to let it happen, so they launched this movement. They wanted to educate the candidates so that everyone could campaign publicly and compete fairly. They wanted to educate the election staff so that they would not withhold ballots or interfere with people's voting. They wanted to educate the voters not to give up their right to vote and actively participate in voting.</p>
<p>With this motivation, they then organized a "Nanhui County Election Education Movement Promotion Association," with the participation of the county party headquarters, the county government's education section, the China Construction Pudong Work Station, the county bank, and the Pujian Company. Chen Tao was appointed as a member and general manager, and Gu Dangqing, Weng Bixian, Zhang Keping, Shen Zhilian, Pan Ziping, Shen Mengqing, and others were appointed as members. In addition, in every township in the county, a</p>
<p>Election Education Team</p>
<p>was established, composed of the township head, the principal of the central school, and the liaison officer sent by the promotion association to each township. Below the township level, security units were also established. Each team was composed of the security chief, the security representative, the principal of the security national school, and the security liaison officer. There were a total of 30 township teams and 499 security teams in the county. The total number of personnel involved in the work exceeded 2,500. Thanks to the initiation of these enthusiastic people, after two weeks of effort, the promotion association finally achieved the expected results.</p>
<p>After the promotion association was established, the first step was naturally publicity, especially widespread and universal publicity for all voters in the county. They organized many propaganda teams, organized by the schools, organized by the township election education teams, and organized by the promotion association itself, totaling about ten teams, working in various places. The methods they adopted included posting slogans and leaflets, disguised speeches, and performing street plays. The content was very different from general campaign propaganda. For example, they wanted voters to have</p>
<p>Interest in elections</p>
<p>and understand election procedures. They put forward the following many slogans:</p>
<p>"Let's have a model election!"</p>
<p>"Let our Nanhui County get first place in the national elections!"</p>
<p>"Vote freely, without interference from anyone!"</p>
<p>"If someone interferes with voting, report to the supervisor immediately."</p>
<p>Regarding the candidates, they paid attention to public and universal introduction, and never made blind recommendations. What they put forward was:</p>
<p>"Welcome candidates, regardless of county affiliation, to openly and fairly compete."</p>
<p>"Oppose anyone colluding with election personnel to deceive public opinion."</p>
<p>"If someone can work for the people's welfare, vote for him!"</p>
<p>"Be careful, selling your vote is selling your own soul!"</p>
<p>At the same time, because candidate Wang Genzhong was a local of Nanhui and usually was able to enthusiastically contribute to local construction projects and community public welfare, the public inevitably had an idol-like worship of him. The election education promotion association, in order to achieve</p>
<p>Fair Election, from the outset, did not hesitate to use slogans to break this idol. They put forward:</p>
<p>"Examine Wang Genzhong. If he has ever abused his power for personal gain, don't vote for him!" "If he has ever oppressed the people, don't vote for him!"</p>
<p>"Examine Wang Genzhong. If he has ever extorted a penny from the people, don't vote for him!"</p>
<p>These many slogans, along with the footprints of every propagandist, penetrated into every village.</p>
<p>The materials for street plays and disguised propaganda were similar to the content of these slogans, wanting</p>
<p>Everyone to vote, wanting everyone not to give up their rights, but the introduction of the candidates was very objective and very universal. Even Wang Genzhong's own Pudong Local Construction Company, the slogans posted on its vehicles never said "Please vote for Mr. Wang Genzhong." What was used instead was the list of all candidates, and the slogan of "Free Election, Fair Competition." The success of this Nanhui election education was greatly due to publicity and visits.</p>
<p>The candidates' campaign activities in Nanhui were also very common. Wu Shaoshu, Yan Xinqi, and others all sent representatives to come, but this kind of so-called "vote buying" was not feasible. The only way was to win the sympathy of the voters. Only by gaining the sympathy of the voters could one get votes. This sentence is absolutely correct in Nanhui.</p>
<p>After the launch of this election education movement, the total number of voters reached 232,313, accounting for 90% of the number of voters, which can be considered a great harvest.</p>

<p>[This newspaper] The Gan Guang basketball team organized by the Jiangxi Provincial Sports College is a strong team in Central China. This time, they came to Shanghai from Gan via Hangzhou for an expedition, with the aim of sightseeing and testing their strength. They played their first game last night against Xionglin, a strong team in Group A2 of this city, at the Municipal Gymnasium. The audience was quite enthusiastic. Gan Guang was defeated by Xionglin with a score of 35 to 47 due to their lack of experience and technique, and the fact that they came from the inland and were not familiar with the new basketball techniques. At halftime, the score was tied at 19, and the outcome was undecided. Although Gan Guang was defeated due to inferior skills, they are young and strong, with abundant stamina and fierce sprints. Given time and training, they have a great future. The details of the battle are recorded as follows:</p>

When time ran out, the guest team lost to Xionglin with a score of 35 to 47.</p>

Before the China World Games Organizing Committee informs us of their needs, it is difficult for us to start preparing for reception and accommodation matters.</p>
<p>The country plans to select representatives to participate in the World Games from the sports meeting to be held in the first full week of May. Regarding this matter, Qiu Erqi further explained: "Although registration for participation in the World Games can be closed two weeks before the opening of the World Games, the number of teams and athletes participating in the World Games should be notified as soon as possible to ensure that the preparation work can proceed smoothly, and the accommodation problem of the athletes can be satisfactorily resolved."</p>

<h3>Result of Negotiations Between the Industrial Association and the National Bank: Purchasing Products to Replace Industrial Loans</h3>
<p>Seventeen Categories of Daily Necessities Can Be Applied For</p>
<p>[This newspaper] The Industrial Association has been in contact with President Zhang of the Central Bank on the issue of opening up industrial loans, and a decision in principle was finally reached yesterday. The result of the consultation between the two parties is that eight principles for purchasing products to replace industrial loans are approved as follows: The principle can be applied to a total of 17 categories of industries, including 14 categories of daily necessities and 3 categories of steel and machinery, except for gauze. Those who apply for purchase must be members of the industry association of the industry. The purchase quantity is limited to the maximum production capacity of one month on average. The purchase price shall be based on the average price of the previous six days before the application date. Each industry must apply directly to the national banking bureau separately. The approval of the application and the evaluation matters shall be decided by the Four Banks Joint Office. Due to the limited government funding, the applicants for purchase are limited to those who are in the most urgent need. Small factories can be assisted by the five major commercial banks. In short, all purchase funds must reach the hands of those who really need it.</p>
<p>Hua Stock Trend Is Erratic; Both Long and Short Positions Feel Uneasy</p>
<p>Hua stocks were still erratic yesterday. On the eve of the roll-over, both long and short positions were uneasy. The front market fell due to the high off-market interest rate. In the rear market, the National Bank entered the market to make up the difference, and the reaction was easy to rise. Then it rebounded again, and the situation of small stocks was quite good. In the early morning, the honor and disgrace were different. Yongsha opened at 750 yuan and 746 yuan, and the current delivery was inverted. After opening, it retreated to 736 yuan and 741 yuan. The situation of small stocks was good, and it once rebounded, rising to a high price of 756 yuan and 760 yuan. The off-market interest rate opened at 3.45% and 3.9%, and immediately declared its inability to support it, and gradually fell to 729 yuan and 734 yuan. The closing price at noon was 737 yuan, and the current delivery Yongsha had been leveled. As a result, compared with the previous closing price, that is, the delivery of shares, Datong rose by 50%, and underwear fell by 10%. Rongyu Tongyi Commercial fell by 50% each, Mei Ya Zhongfang rose slightly, and Qinxing Jingfu Xinguang were all flat, and the rest fell slightly. In the delivery of shares, Jingfu rose slightly, and Qinxing fell by 50%, while the rest all fell slightly.</p>
<p>Only immediate delivery was done in the rear cloth, starting from 736 yuan, and gradually prospered. The National Bank exchanged and made up the difference, and people's hearts recovered. After 3:00 p.m., it rose to 764 yuan. The closing price was 761 yuan. Compared with the morning closing price, Yonggongsheng rose by 10%, and Xinhao Meiya Huafeng Xinguang Zhongfa Xinhua Lianyuan Yefeng Tongyi Zhongsi all rose by 50%, Zhongfang fell slightly, and the rest all rose slightly. The prices of off-market unlisted stocks all showed signs of fatigue, and there were more selling orders.</p>
<p>United Debt and Foreign Stocks Are Both Weak</p>
<p>Government bonds were also weak yesterday. Tongbing opened at 66,000 in the morning, and retreated from 67,000 to a low price of 61,000, and then stabilized slightly. The turnover was about 5 million, which was 3,000 yuan lower than the previous closing price for A and B, and 4,000 yuan lower for C, D and E.</p>
<p>Foreign stocks were weak yesterday because the devaluation of the French franc caused general psychological fears that it would affect the British pound. There was a strong selling trend in the middle of the day, and they were weak. Yisha gradually fell from 605,000 to 555,000 and then stabilized slightly. The rear market followed the Hua stocks and tended to be stable. Banks helped maintain the price, retail investors supplied goods, and securities firms advanced first and then exited. As a result, compared with the previous closing price, Yisha paper edition shipping steel telephone cars were all flat, reclamation fell by 50%, and Yilianhui Defeng Yeguang Yiwei fell slightly.</p>
<p>Internal Exchange Rate Correction</p>
<p>The internal exchange rates of the four banks, two bureaus and one treasury will be revised from the 29th as follows: Fuzhou 700 yuan (originally 100 yuan), Guangzhou 70 yuan (originally 90 yuan), Changsha 40 yuan (originally 70 yuan), Hengyang 40 yuan (originally 70 yuan), Nanchang 30 yuan (originally 40 yuan), Chongqing 5 yuan (originally 3 yuan), Chengdu 5 yuan (originally 3 yuan), other places remain unchanged.</p>
<p>To Prevent the Abuse of Checks, the Financial Management Bureau Sends Staff to Conduct Spot Checks</p>
<p>[This newspaper] It is reported that the Shanghai Financial Management Bureau still strictly implements the regulations of the Ministry of Finance on the ineligibility of daily bills for repayment. The bureau is constantly paying close attention to the bills exchanged in this city every day. As for the technical matters related to implementation, it is heard that the Ministry of Finance has drafted implementation measures, which will be announced soon. Recently, due to the approaching Spring Festival and the slightly tight monetary policy, in order to balance their positions and avoid risks, the banks and corporations in this city have automatically paid attention to the issue of bill repayment. Therefore, the bills used for repayment by banks and corporations on the same day have been rarely found in recent days.</p>
<p>It is also learned that in order to prevent banks and corporations from abusing checks, the Financial Management Bureau has ordered all banks and corporations to fill in and report the names, addresses and purposes of bills of their current account holders in detail before the 29th of this month. The bureau will also send staff to conduct spot checks. If the facts of the regulations are found to be inconsistent with the report, the account will be suspended.</p>
<h3>Rice Prices Rise First and Then Fall; Oil Market Circles Upward</h3>
<p>The situation has been loosening. The price of white rice was raised several times. The price of flour from the north is high, and people's hearts are firm. It continued to rise by 120,000 yuan. The factory sold it off, and the price of flour increased by 15,000 yuan. The form is rising step by step. There is more bran supply than demand, and it fell by 34,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Soybean cake dealers did not move, and retail investors advanced slightly. The factory firmly believed that the cost was high, and the selling heart was very firm, and the price increased by more than 10,000 yuan. Mung beans were relaxed in the north, and the price was tired by 120,000 yuan. Adzuki beans were sluggish, and they fell by 120,000 yuan. Broad beans were sluggish and the actual sales were not good, and they fell by 340,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Sorghum rose early and was tired at noon, and the closing price was very sluggish. It was firm on the surface and soft in secret. Corn was sluggish in the north and the actual sales were light, and it was reduced by 120,000 yuan step by step. Sesame was continuously processed in Tianjin, and oil factories also participated. The sales were surprisingly strong, and the demand exceeded the supply. It continued to rise by 780,000 yuan. Raw peanuts were not good for the Guangwei stomach. The local street picked and moved to handle, and continued to fall by 350,000 yuan. Soybean Minbang was active, and oil factories were very greedy. The local street continued to add purchases, and it gradually increased, rising by 230,000 yuan step by step. Duhuang also increased by 10,000 yuan, and the situation was high and more solid.</p>
<p>The oil market circled upward, and soybean oil continued to rise by 350,000 yuan, rapeseed oil rose by 340,000 yuan, raw oil and sesame oil continued to rise sharply by 100,000 yuan, but the arrival of light oil was surging, and the market was flat.</p>
<h3>Green and White Sugar Retreat</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market tended to be flat and tired again. The association divided the market. The spot price of 24 coarse white was 1,685,000.</p>
<p>Yesterday, a total of 10,900 shi of rice arrived in the north and south markets. The market rose first and then fell. Both japonica and indica rice showed signs of stability. The closing price was slightly softened, reaching 673,000 yuan, a small amount of 340,000 yuan. The price of four-and-a-half white was 1,700,000 to 690,000 yuan, a small amount of 120,000 yuan.

<h3>The Tea Market Is on a Solid Footing</h3>
<p>The foreign merchant tea market, exporters are still extremely active in the situation of foreign sales of tea and domestic sales of patterns. Green tea has remained in the lead due to the consumption of local merchants and foreign merchants, so there are still many inquiries. Unfortunately, the inventory in the market has not increased so far, and the transaction volume has not increased more than the previous day in the lack of supply. In terms of price, they have continued to show their elegance, and there is no sign of falling.</p>
<h3>Remittances to North China Have Not Stopped</h3>
<p>[This newspaper] National Bank officials said that remittances to North China have not stopped in recent months. If there are legitimate uses for industry and commerce, they have been approved separately. In the future, industrial and commercial remittances should also be approved for exchange based on the circumstances. It is also rumored that after the petition delegation from North China went to Beijing, the Central Bank decided to provide funds to alleviate the difficulties of North China's industry and export industry by purchasing. National Bank officials refused to comment on this point.</p>
<p>Chinese Medicine Rises</p>
<p>The Chinese medicine market is now facing rising transportation costs and increased foreign costs. In addition, the purchase prices in the producing areas are rising step by step. Hankou and Ganzhou have been lacking in arrivals for a long time. The price in Hankou has risen, and the stock in Shanghai is empty. The supply is unbalanced, and the market price is rising steadily. The opening and transaction prices of Xixidangshen are: Kuilu 400,000, Tulv 360,000, and Gonglu 320,000. The price of Ximian Top was also raised to 320,000. Xiang's producing areas are short of goods, and it is difficult to purchase them. Hunters are hoarding goods, and Taiwan and foreign countries have a sharp increase in access. The price of Mao Xiang has soared to 26 million, creating an unprecedented high price. The refining and cleaning process consumes a lot of money, so the prices of Jue Xiang with the names of "Yi", "Quan", and "Du" have to follow suit, rising to as high as 72 million. It is said that there is still a lot of profit.</p>
<h3>The Cotton Industry Pays Attention to the Detailed Rules of Management; It Is Decided to Convene a General Meeting to Discuss Countermeasures</h3>
<p>[This newspaper] The Six District Cotton Textile Association convened a standing council meeting yesterday. In addition to reporting to Chairman Yuan of the Yarn Management Committee for requesting the Jingwo outside, each director saw the published official announcement of the Yarn Management Committee, the detailed rules for the implementation of the unified purchase of cotton and the registration method of cotton yarn. The emotions were immediately tense. The reason is that the directors requested Chairman Yuan on the 27th to postpone the publication of the detailed rules for implementation. The directors did not know the details of the detailed rules and had no way to prepare. Once the publication and implementation are announced, it will inevitably be difficult to implement. The announcement came out immediately after the request was made, which is a great regret. Moreover, according to the cotton yarn registration method, the cotton yarn in each factory cannot be moved from the 29th of this month, which is equivalent to freezing it. It is even more inappropriate to increase the difficulty of capital turnover in each factory at the end of the lunar year. After discussion, it was decided to convene an extraordinary general meeting of all members on the afternoon of the 29th to discuss countermeasures for the industry.</p>
<p>[Another report] The standing directors of the Six District Cotton Textile Association visited Chairman Yuan of the Yarn Management Committee again at around 4 pm yesterday to reiterate the opinions of the industry and request the Yarn Management Committee to pay attention to the opinions of the yarn factory industry and give them consideration. Do not make it impossible to implement after the announcement of the detailed rules for implementation. It is heard that Chairman Yuan was quite moved and was willing to give it further consideration.</p>
<h3>The Allocation Price Remains Unchanged; The Sales Are Sluggish; Cotton Yarn Continues to Weaken</h3>
<p>The Cloth Opens Small and Then Recovers Firmly</p>
<p>Yesterday, in the analysis of the yarn market, the Textile Construction Company opened yarn as usual. The allocation price did not change, the sales were very sluggish, the foreign merchants' appetite was weak, and the local street also lacked improvement. Moreover, the Yarn Management Committee held registration, and people's hearts were softening. Many long positions were closed. Until the end, the price of 42 blue phoenix fine yarn fell by 300,000 compared with the previous day, at 58 million yuan. The prices of other coarse and fine yarns also continued to fall by 350,000 to 1 million yuan.</p>
<p>[This newspaper] The China Textile Construction Company sold yarn as usual yesterday, selling a total of 464 pieces, and 603 pieces of 20-count yarn. The selling price of 20-count Golden Rooster yarn was still 34.75 million yuan.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the cloth market opened with small gains. Because the cotton yarn was being registered, people's hearts were extremely soft, and the countertop was also very strong. The low price of dragon head fine cloth was 1.57 million yuan, and the low price of Five Blessings was 1.245 million yuan. There were a few transactions. After 10 o'clock, it was heard that the Hankou gang had news of waiting for ships to rush to load, and the buying appetite in the market turned stronger. The yarn and flower gangs also came to sell yarn and buy cloth to do hedge transactions. The floating air groups rose to make up for the losses, and the market recovered again. In the end, the price of each grade of 12-pound fine cloth rose by 45,000 to 156,000 yuan compared with the previous day. The direct purchase price of serge also rose by 10,000 to 30,000 yuan. The footing of other cloths seemed to be quite strong.</p>
<p>Raw Cotton Continues to Weaken</p>
<p>Yesterday, the standard cotton market turned weak. Due to the weakness of yarn and cloth, people's hearts were depressed, and buyers were waiting and watching. Yarn factories were absorbing at low prices, and transactions were slightly expanded. The Textile Construction Company had not yet opened the price, and the transactions between the industry were therefore silent. 220 bales were traded yesterday, and the closing price of the Guan Factory was 5,428,000 for the three-odd Zhen, 5,374,000 for the Han fine, and the closing price of the Jian giao was 5,374,000 for the Han fine, 5,870,000 for Shashi, and 1,220,000 to 1,230,000 for Zhoupu seed flower.</p>
<p>Woolen Cloth Is Deserted</p>
<p>Yesterday, in the Chang Le Teahouse, Qipan Street and Xie Da Zhengyu and other large wholesalers, woolen cloth transactions in and out were deserted. Because the business of both the local street and the foreign gang was mostly lagging, the buyers were making steady and steady profits, which led to the rare sales and the price turned mostly flat. Yesterday, the white-edged Maiden was sold for 1.25 million yuan per yard, and the local-edged Maiden was sold for 850,000 yuan. The various firms in the industry felt bored early, and the transactions were clear.</p>
<h3>Cigarettes and Soap Are Stable</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the cigarette market opened stable. It was then heard that the tax procedures of the Yizhong Company had not been completed, and the distribution of goods was expected to be delayed until the 2nd of next month. The local street was eager to make up for the losses, and the trading was even more prosperous in the afternoon, and the market rose step by step. As a result, the price of ten British Old Knife two cigarettes rose by 500,000 to 550,000 yuan compared with the previous day, and the prices of other Chinese and foreign cigarettes also rose.</p>
<p>In the daily necessities and soap market, the market atmosphere was weak in the morning due to the sale of recycled Arrow Knife soap. In the afternoon, as the monetary policy tended to be loose, the internal and external purchases of the industry rose, and the final price of solidified soap rose by 25,000 yuan compared with the previous day, and the price of arrow knife rose by a small amount of 20,000 yuan. Xiangmao Niupai also rose by 12,000. Guanghua Beauty and others were stable. The sales of matches and miscellaneous brands were relatively booming, and the prices rose by 120,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>On the Issue of Overseas Remittances from Siam (Thailand)</h3>
<p>— Xu Zuoren</p>
<p>The figures for overseas remittances from Siam over the years have not yet been officially tallied, but are estimated to be over 20 million yuan in gold. The total amount of overseas remittances from Siam last year and for each month of the past year are listed below, based on statistics from the Bangkok Chinese Yuan Bao newspaper:</p>
<p>According to the table above, we can see that the largest amount of remittances in national currency (Guobi) last year was in July, totaling 11.1 billion yuan, and the smallest was in January, at just 1.11 billion yuan. In terms of Siamese currency (baht), February saw the most remittances, totaling over 64 million baht, while December had the least, just over 12 million baht. (This figure is a half-month statistic; the total for the full month should be more than this.) Looking at the full-year figures for overseas remittances, the amount in national currency is gradually increasing, but when viewed in terms of Siamese currency, it is trending downward. In particular, August saw a sharp drop from over 56 million baht in the previous month to just over 19 million baht, a decrease of almost two-fold. There are two main reasons for this gradual decrease in remittances from Siam:</p>
<p>First: Due to the instability of the national currency's value. As shown in the table above, the exchange rate from January to December declines like a staircase, with a forty-fold drop between January and December. Upon closer inspection, the rapid decline resembles "walking a tightrope," constantly swaying. As a result, although the national currency was declining earlier, overseas Chinese were reluctant to lose out of patriotism, so each drop stimulated excitement about remittances. However, like the surging Yangtze River, it was gone and unrecoverable. Once the hope of recovery was dashed, enthusiasm cooled considerably. Those who previously did not want to miss out on initial declines now have the experience that "there is no end to the decline" and have adopted an unconditionally bearish attitude. The gradual decrease in remittances is therefore to be expected.</p>
<p>Second: Due to speculation on remittances. Because remittances cannot be directly transferred domestically by our country's banks and are mostly handled by private remittance agencies, and because the currency value is declining daily, this has led to speculation by remittance agencies paying for overseas remittances. They often compete by absorbing remittance drafts at lower prices. The total amount of remittances from January to July last year was approximately 320 million baht, accounting for three-quarters of the total for the year, while remittances from August to December totaled just over 90 million baht; this is due to the prevalence of speculation on remittances before July. In particular, the record high in July, ranking second for the year, was due to the impact of speculation. Also, because the remittance amount in July was exceptionally high, subsequent months appeared even more sluggish. The economic capacity of overseas Chinese is limited, except for a few with more assets who have no problems raising funds. Because July’s intake was too much, it could not be replenished instantly after July, so regardless of how "low Kang" the exchange rate was in September and October, the amount of remittances continued to decline.</p>

<h3>Review of Seven Post-War Published Educational Maps</h3>
<p>— Liu Gao</p>
<p>The struggle for territory is often an important cause of war. Even wars that do not arise from territorial disputes often end with territorial concessions. Therefore, almost every war changes the face of the map. The changes in the borders of China and other major participating countries in this World War are so great that pre-war geography books and maps must be significantly revised. However, many of the geography textbooks published by various bookstores in our country after the war have been substantially revised or only slightly modified, and their content is more inconsistent with the post-war situation than the pre-war versions. Only newly published maps have mostly been redrawn entirely. After careful reading, the content is far from satisfactory. The sixteen-page maps of China and foreign countries seen by the reviewer are as follows:</p>
<p>1. Yang Jingxiong et al.: Latest Provincial Map of the Republic of China (Huan Cheng Publishing House)</p>
<p>2. Jin Qingyu: China Geography Textbook Map (Da Zhongguo Bookstore)</p>
<p>3. Chen Duo et al.: China Geography Textbook Map (Nan Wu)</p>
<p>4. Wang Chengzong et al.: New China Provincial Map (New China Publishing House)</p>
<p>5. Jin Qingyu: World Geography Textbook Map (Da Zhongguo Bookstore)</p>
<p>6. Qiu Zumou et al.: New World Atlas (New China Publishing House)</p>
<p>7. Chen Duo et al.: World Geography Textbook Map (Commercial Press)</p>
<p>In addition, Da Zhongguo Bookstore also has China Provincial News and New World National Maps, whose content is the same as the above-mentioned maps 2 and 5. There are also many pocket editions published by other bookstores, all of which are omitted. The reviewer does not intend to check the small errors in each map, such as incorrect locations and incorrect place names, but only points out the inappropriate compilation styles and more serious errors. The following statements apply to the shortcomings shared by all maps unless otherwise specified.</p>
<p>Layered Colors</p>
<p>Since the publication of the China Map (Shen Bao Guan) by Ding Wenjiang et al. in the 22nd year of the Republic of China (1933), the method of drawing maps by dividing layers with contour lines has become a fashion. Over the past ten years, most of the maps published in our country have been drawn using this method. However, the contour lines drawn are mostly thick brown lines with deep colors. In provinces or countries with mountainous terrain, there must be many contour lines. Therefore, contour lines have become the most eye-catching feature in the maps of mountainous provinces or countries. The maps of these provinces or countries appear blurred and difficult to read, which can be said to be a major shortcoming. The contour lines in the map by Ding Wenjiang et al., which was the first to be drawn using this method, are extremely thin black dashed lines, without this shortcoming. The reviewer believes that since layers have already been divided and colored, then even these thin dashed lines can be removed, because a line is naturally formed between two different colors.</p>
<p>Villages and Town Names</p>
<p>Each provincial division of the Chinese maps listed above, at least in part, not only depicts county towns but also cities larger than counties, as well as many villages and towns. The trend of adding small place names below the county level to middle school textbook maps seems to have started in the early days of the War of Resistance. At that time, small place names often appeared in war news, and people could not obtain detailed maps except by consulting middle school textbook maps. Therefore, publishers of middle school maps competed with each other for having small place names in their maps. However, during wartime, due to the relationship between the location and the terrain, fierce battles could take place even in a three-household village, and its place name could appear in the headline of a newspaper. When reading war news, sometimes even the most detailed maps secretly kept by military agencies are not enough. A map should be in accordance with the situation. For those labeled for middle school teaching, it is enough to draw only county towns and a few small place names of special importance. If you want more detail, you must increase the version size. It is not appropriate to add small place names without restriction in a small version, which increases the difficulty of reading. Among the above-mentioned Chinese maps, Jin Qingyu's China Geography Textbook Map is better in terms of drawing, but it also has the most small place names, especially the Sichuan Province map, which is particularly difficult to read and can be said to be a major shortcoming.</p>
<p>New National Borders</p>
<p>The only thing that the world maps published in our country after the war are better than those published before the war is that they have the new national borders after the war. Other changes besides the national borders are not included, which makes the revisions seem too few. The Soviet Union was composed of ten one Soviet Socialist Republics before the Great War, but after the war, it has increased to sixteen republics. The five newly added republics are all in the west. In addition to drawing the new borders of the Soviet Union, the three world maps listed above still preserve part of the old borders and the boundary lines between the republics. The Jin and Chen world maps both cancel the boundary line between Lithuania and East Prussia. Although the two maps agree on this point unintentionally, they are baseless and lead to errors. After the northern part of East Prussia belongs to the Soviet Union, it is劃into the Russian Republic and not劃into Lithuania. The reviewer believes that errors are better than omissions. The authors of the three maps do not know how the new territories of the Soviet Union are divided. They should know that the boundary lines between the old republics must already be inaccurate, and it is better to omit them when drawing the maps. There have also been major changes in the boundary lines of provinces and regions within the Russian Republic. Many of the Soviet city names have been newly changed, but the three maps listed above have not been modified. (The boundary lines between the Soviet republics and provinces and regions cannot be explained in a few words. Last spring, new world maps were published abroad with the latest national borders and political divisions. Last summer, Shanghai had them for sale.)</p>
<p>Self-Governing Dominions</p>
<p>Before World War I, the United Kingdom had five self-governing dominions, one of which was Newfoundland. Shortly after World War I (1922), the Irish Free State was established, increasing the number of self-governing dominions to six. The following year (1923), Southern Rhodesia in South Africa was changed from a directly-governed colony to a self-governing dominion, bringing the total to seven self-governing dominions. In 1933, Newfoundland requested to be changed to a directly-governed colony due to financial difficulties, leaving only six self-governing dominions. There have been more increases since World War II. As far as the reviewer knows, all books and maps published in the country over the past twenty years have not been corrected, and they all say that the United Kingdom has five self-governing dominions and that one of them is Newfoundland, which is quite strange. The three world maps listed above have not been corrected either, treating the situation before World War I as the current situation after World War II, which is disappointing.</p>
<p>Level of Detail</p>
<p>World maps published in our country often have simplified depictions of South America, Africa, and Oceania, with only one map for each continent. Europe and North America, in addition to the full continental maps, always have separate maps. The reviewer believes that some small countries in Europe and North America are not larger or more important than the countries in South America, Africa, and Oceania. Their maps can already be seen in the full continental maps, and there is no need for separate maps. The national defense map of China in Jin Qingyu's China map has nothing related to national defense other than provincial borders, national borders, highways, and railways. Provincial and national borders can already be seen on the political map, and highways and railways can already be seen on the transportation map. This so-called "national defense map" is completely meaningless and should be deleted to save space. Otherwise, the content must be enriched to make it worthy of the name.</p>
<p>Attached Explanations</p>
<p>The seven maps listed above all have more than fifty or sixty pages of explanations. However, Yang Jingxiong et al.'s Latest Provincial Map of the Republic of China has a gazetteer. Each school has separate geography textbooks when teaching, and teachers and students seem to rarely read the map explanations. And the place names in geography textbooks cannot be annotated with detailed locations. Smaller place names are difficult to find without a gazetteer. The reviewer believes that a map can be without explanations, but it cannot be without a gazetteer.</p>
<p>The seven maps listed above each have their own advantages and disadvantages. Among them, Qiu Zumou et al.'s New World Atlas, Chen Duo et al.'s World Geography Textbook Map, and Wang Chengzong's New China Provincial Map are relatively poor. Wang Chengzong's map was published at the end of September of the 35th year of the Republic of China (1946). If the reviewer's guess is correct, this map was originally intended to be published before the start of the school year in September of the 35th year of the Republic of China (1946), and the drawing was started too late. Therefore, it was hastily completed in a short time, and there are many omissions. The national soil map is so wrong that it is useless. The draftsman did not read the instructions, and the instructions written and the attached instructions are inconsistent with each other. The new national borders drawn in Qiu Zumou et al.'s New World Map Collection are erroneous and incomplete. Chen Duo et al.'s World Geography Textbook Map is not actually newly drawn, but only the old map has the new national borders added in red money, which is also incomplete. As mentioned above, the only advantage of the world maps published in our country after the war is that they have new national borders. Qiu and Chen's maps do not even have this only advantage.</p>
<p>The four Chinese maps listed above are, on the whole, not as good as Ding Wenjiang et al.'s New Provincial Map of China (Shen Bao Guan) published before the war. The three world maps listed above are also not as good as Tan Lian's Latest World Atlas (Commercial Press) before the war. The eight-year War of Resistance has obviously regressed our country in many ways, and it has not been able to restore its original level more than two years after the victory. Maps can be said to be one aspect of it.</p>
<h3>Introduction to "The Reconstruction of Chinese Agriculture"</h3>
<p>— Mu Yun</p>
<p>Author: Luo Jun Price: NT$200</p>
<p>Published by: Taiwan Sugar Corporation Sugarcane Research Institute</p>
<p>The author, Dr. Luo Jun, specializes in sugarcane. After graduating from Jinling University in Nanjing at an early age, he returned to Guangxi in the south to engage in practical agricultural work, delving into the hinterland of the province to investigate specialty crops. He also used tractors to cultivate 10,000 mu of wasteland in Shibei Peng, Liucheng County, to plant sugarcane, which was one of the earliest large-scale experiments in mechanized agriculture in our country. In the 24th year of the Republic of China (1935), he presided over agricultural affairs at the Guixian Sugar Factory, which was well-known in the sugarcane industry in our country. In the 27th year of the Republic of China (1938), he went to Louisiana State University in the United States for further study, specializing in sugarcane pathology. He returned to China in the 30th year of the Republic of China (1941) and taught at Fujian Agricultural College and Guangxi University until the end of the War of Resistance. After the restoration of Taiwan, he returned to the sugarcane industry and served as the director of the Sugarcane Research Institute of the Taiwan Sugar Corporation. "The Reconstruction of Chinese Agriculture" is the author's reflection on China's agricultural policy over the years.</p>
<p>Regarding Chinese agriculture, the author believes that the self-sufficient agricultural management model must end. Farmers are still people, and farmers also need to live a human life. After the destruction of China's self-sufficient agricultural society by the commodity economy, the income from self-sufficient agricultural management is meager, and farmers' annual income is very small. Unless the way farmers manage their farms is changed, it will be impossible to improve the lives of farmers, who account for 80% of China's population. This also means that it is impossible to improve the living standards of the Chinese people.</p>
<p>China must become an industrialized country, and self-sufficient farm management is an obstacle to industrialization. It divides social production into countless small production units, and each production unit is surrounded by a layer of insulation, preventing the concentration of production and suffocating the lifeline of low-priced supply of industrial raw materials.</p>
<p>Agricultural finance, like industrial management, cannot lose money. If managing agriculture does not even pay wages, no one will want to manage it. Self-sufficient agricultural management is a production method that does not calculate costs, does not ask for profits, and has the least effect. In a self-sufficient society with barter, farmers can exchange their products for agricultural products they do not have, which is enough for them to survive. However, if they exchange them for industrial products and daily necessities, they can exchange very little, which is the reason for the low purchasing power of Chinese rural areas. We believe that the only way to improve the living standards of the majority of farmers and increase the purchasing power of rural areas in China today is to change agricultural management, turning unprofitable agricultural management into profitable agricultural management, which is what the author refers to as enterprise farming.</p>
<p>Enterprise farming requires first geography and second technology. The author advocates developing local specialties on the spot, that is, taking advantage of the situation and making a start, and then consolidating the foundation of production technology with the assistance of government technical personnel. When enterprises prosper, profits can be used to increase research funds and use enterprise profits to improve the production methods of the industry, so that the enterprise will be invincible over time.</p>
<p>Enterprise agriculture must have an environment that can prosper, and the responsibility for opening up and arranging this environment rests with the state. We believe that the government should have priorities, and indomitable confidence in building new enterprise agriculture, first developing transportation to facilitate transportation and reduce production costs; then building dams and dredging rivers to ensure the safety and stability of production volume; and then controlling the prices of agricultural products and preventing the tragic drop in agricultural product prices, and sharing the losses of disasters by消声者, so that production and消声form a whole, so that the losses caused to farmers by natural disasters and man-made disasters can be reduced to a minimum.</p>
<p>The backbone of enterprise farming is the knowledge of the producers. Enterprise farmers must not only have production technology, but also need to have common sense of sales, storage, and refining. All of this cannot be done by illiterate people. China wants to develop a new agricultural gold industry, and she has the power to carry out nine years of compulsory education, so that agricultural producers have the intellectual level of junior high school and become farmers in the scientific age.</p>
<p>The book is divided into ten chapters: Chapter 1, China enters the era of enterprise morning industry. Chapter 2, The Improvement of Chinese Morning Industry and Its Obstacles. Chapter 3, Basic Understanding of Building a New Agriculture. Chapter 4, Establishment of a New Agricultural Zone in China. Chapter 5, The Driving Force of Agricultural Construction. Chapter 6, The Dependence of New Agricultural Enterprises on People's Livelihood Industries. Chapter 7, The Guarantee System of Enterprise Agriculture. Chapter 8, The Road to Agricultural Science in China. Chapter 9, The Responsibility of the Government. Chapter 10, A Theatrical Example.</p>
<p>Overall, the book's arguments are precise, its insights are unique, and it is a book worth introducing to readers who are concerned about the future of Chinese agriculture.</p>
<h3>After Reading "Sensation Psychology"</h3>
<p>— Zuo Renxia</p>
<p>Written by Zhang Yaoxiang Published by Commercial Press Price: Six Yuan</p>
<p>Since the victory of the War of Resistance, the famous works on the psychology of sensation that I have had the opportunity to read are: one is Perception and Cognition by Professor Boring of Harvard University in the United States (first edition in 1942); the second is Sensory Theory by Professor Piéron of the University of Paris (1946 edition); and the third is Sensation Psychology, a recent work by Zhang Yaoxiang, a senior figure in the Chinese psychology field. Boring's argument focuses on the historical system; Piéron's point of view focuses only on physiological phenomena. As for Zhang's writings, they collect all the facts of psychological experiments, engage in deep exploration, and use clear words and fluent writing to compile a special collection to guide future generations. It is necessary to introduce it first.</p>
<p>The original book is divided into nine chapters. The first chapter is an overview: a general discussion of the common properties of sensation, and also involves issues such as the classification of sensation. Chapter 2 discusses cutaneous sensation: in addition to discussing general properties, it also discusses complex sensations such as hard, smooth, blunt, wet, sticky, and itchy. Chapter 3 discusses olfaction: this chapter has unique insights into topics such as olfactory preference and art. Chapter 4 discusses gustation: there are also novel discoveries about taste preference and art. Chapter 5 discusses the sense of hearing: this chapter is essential scientific information for those who study music. Chapter 6 discusses the sense of sight: this chapter discusses the theory of color and the psychology of color appreciation in detail, and is especially a good work that those engaged in 事 should have on hand. Chapter 7 discusses kinesthetic sensation: in addition to general discussions, there are also discussions on complex sensations such as effort, friction, movement, and direction. Chapter 8 discusses interoception: in addition to general discussions, it also provides reasonable explanations for nausea, colic, childbirth, and sexual sensation. Chapter 9 discusses animal sensation: this chapter is the most lacking in domestic heart regulation literature, and I am very happy that the author has made an interesting supplement to this.</p>
<p>In terms of the whole book, its characteristics that are worthy of special mention are approximately the following teaching points:</p>
<p>General psychological writings often focus on principles and ignore facts, while this book focuses on the concrete facts of psychology, in contrast to principles. Therefore, some "Mr. So-and-so's law, Mr. So-and-so's principle" that have been praised by the world are often not invited to be included.</p>
<p>This book discusses sensation not only in humans, but also in animals, and there is a special chapter discussing it; this is undoubtedly a stimulant for the Chinese psychology field, which is still neglecting animal psychology research.</p>
<p>Most of the psychological writings published in China are due to the unassimilated swallowing of foreigners' writings, so the text often cannot convey its meaning, causing readers to become tired. The author of this book is able to express profound meanings with fluent writing, so that readers do not feel the dryness of science, but only the appreciation of literature and art.</p>
<p>Most of the psychology circles in our country only understand imported psychology; but the psychological wisdom accumulated in Chinese studies has never been consulted. The author of this book is proficient in both Chinese and Western learning, so his writings often cite extensively. Gao Lian of the Ming Dynasty's discussion of incense and Zheng Fuguan of the Qing Dynasty's discussion of color are all examples developed by the author.</p>
<p>Zhang's psychology of sensation is part of his planned compendium of central psychology, of which the introduction, sensation, and emotion articles have been published in separate volumes one after another, and the rest are waiting to be published. According to the world, psychology giants like "Integrated" are all written by a large number of psychologists. Apart from Ribot, the hero who wrote "Integrated" by himself is still a rare sight like Zhang's.</p>
<p>Finally, I originally planned to say a few words of criticism to achieve the effect of seeking completeness, but I occasionally thought of committing the suspicion of "small scolding is a big praise"; and the true price of this book is there, there is no need to talk too much, it is better to stop here.</p>
<h3>Translation Examples</h3>
<p>— Zhong Huan</p>
<p>(Compiled by Su Zhaolong Published by Jingwen Bookstore)</p>
<p>Jingwen Bookstore has indeed made great efforts in publishing English books. Most of the books it publishes are suitable for middle school students. They are divided into research and practical types, and "both reading materials and reference books are equally important." This "Translation Examples" is a good reference book.</p>
<p>The translation work of Mr. Su Zhaolong, the author of Translation Examples, has always been admired by everyone. We can know that this is a good book for a translator like Mr. Su to write this small "Translation Examples." This book has been proofread and corrected by Mr. Ge Chuanrong.</p>
<p>This book is divided into two major categories for research: English to Chinese and Chinese to English. It is divided into four parts: The first part and the second part include examples of "sentence translation." The first part is English to Chinese, and the second part is Chinese to English. Each example sentence has two or more translations, so that scholars can use it flexibly. Every ten example sentences are attached with an exercise, totaling one hundred and twenty example sentences and twelve exercises. The third and fourth parts include examples of "paragraph translation." The third part is English to Chinese, and the fourth part is Chinese to English. Each paragraph is followed by comments. The good ones explain their advantages, and the bad ones are corrected, so that scholars can try to translate themselves before reading the translation, and then compare it with the comments, which will make progress faster. There are a total of sixty articles, each with an exercise attached to every five articles. As for the themes, they are mostly selected from European and American masterpieces and the Romance of the Three Kingdoms and Ancient and Modern Wonders, which can arouse interest.</p>
<p>Translation is a tool for communicating Eastern and Western cultures. It is the most important and most difficult part of English, and there have always been very few reference books on translation. This time, I was fortunate enough to find this Translation Examples and introduce it in particular.</p>
<h3>Wen Tung English Primer</h3>
<p>— Ge Chenxun</p>
<p>The Wen Tung English Course Primer, Volumes One and Two, compiled by Lu Dianyang, first edition published by Wen Tung Bookstore in February of the 36th year of the Republic.</p>
<p>This is an elementary English textbook, just as its name suggests, specifically for those who are beginning to learn English. The most elementary English teaching materials are the most difficult to compile. It is not easy to compile materials suitable for teaching without a very deep understanding of English language and literature and rich experience in English teaching. This is a fact generally recognized by teachers.</p>
<p>Elementary school Chinese language textbooks often have only a few words per lesson. They seem extremely easy, but truly well-compiled textbooks are few and far between. This is because the fewer the words used, the higher the level of skill required for compilation. People often have high aspirations but low abilities, capable only of criticism and unable to compile themselves. If that's the case even for Chinese language textbooks, one can imagine how difficult it is for elementary English textbooks. Therefore, for decades, there have been very few excellent elementary English textbooks published in the market.</p>
<p>In English-speaking countries like England and the United States, textbooks used for children often have what is called a Primer PrePrimer before the first volume, with few words, so that children can have adequate preparation before formally learning a language. The famous British The Oxford English Course has a Primer volume, and the American Learning to Read, published in 1945, has two volumes: Pre-primer 1-Bill and Susen and Pre-primer 2-Under the Tree. Most other books are like this as well.</p>
<p>The Wen Tung English Primer is a Primer, and its compilation is very similar to the British style, which is more formal. It is extremely suitable for use as an elementary school English textbook. Elementary school children in our country are originally allowed to study English when local needs require it. It is said that the Ministry of Education's recently revised but not yet announced elementary school curriculum standards also allow various regions to select foreign languages if needed. Elementary school children in places such as Shanghai and Guangzhou have always had optional English classes, so there is a real need for English textbooks suitable for elementary teaching.</p>
<p>According to learning psychology, it is better for children to learn a foreign language at a younger age. It is not easy to succeed if they are too old. It is a very common and significant phenomenon that older students in junior high school often do not perform as well in English as younger students. Originally, language is not a knowledge discipline, but a skill, like typing, playing the piano, swimming, or playing ball, and it must go through countless repetitions of learning before it can be used skillfully and naturally. This kind of repeated practice is most effective when applied to young children. The older they get, the more they like to use reason and comparative study, and they are unwilling to imitate and repeat the exercises like young children. This is most detrimental to learning a foreign language. Therefore, if elementary school children select English, they can easily succeed if the teacher is good and the teaching materials are good. And it does not hinder the learning of other subjects at all.</p>
<p>Speaking of teaching materials, elementary schools generally use junior high school English textbooks. The physical and mental development of junior high school students is different from that of elementary school children. The progress of junior high school English is very fast, and the content is not suitable for elementary school children. Some elementary schools use foreign elementary school textbooks, but the living habits of foreign children seem unfamiliar to Chinese children. Even with good teachers, the lack of good teaching materials ultimately makes it impossible to achieve significant teaching results.</p>
<p>The Wen Tung English Primer, in terms of level, is suitable for fifth and sixth graders in elementary school; children over the age of ten will definitely find it easy to learn. After learning the Primer, they can lay a foundation in English, and in the future, when they go on to learn junior high school English, they can achieve twice the result with half the effort.</p>
<p>The compilation of the entire book is very thoughtful. The two volumes have forty lessons, with about 150 new words. The first volume has only 64 words, and the second volume has only 85 words. The restrictions are extremely strict, and the repetitions are extremely numerous, which is very much in line with the psychology of language learning. In addition to the text, each disc has listening, speaking and other exercises in the first volume, and command, question-and-answer and other exercises in the second volume. Repeated changes make it a habit; each volume also has writing exercises, arranged in a scientific way from simple strokes to familiar words and sentences. Every four or six lessons form a unit, and the content is consistent. After each unit, there are various tests: multiple choice, fill-in-the-blanks, silent listening, question-and-answer, true or false, etc., mostly represented by pictures, which can increase interest. Using this book, the teaching situation will be very lively.</p>
<p>I love to read its texts the most. The progression of the texts is natural and lively, and the sentences used are all used in daily life. It is not difficult to teach this kind of text in a class of fifty children. I know that many elementary school teachers in Shanghai are choosing a good English textbook to make it easier for their children to learn, so I am happy to introduce this Wen Tung English Primer.</p>
<p>The compiler of the Wen Tung English Primer, Mr. Lu Dianyang, has served as an English professor at National Southeast University and National Zhejiang University, training English teachers, and has done a lot of research on English teaching, and has written many works, which I think readers are well aware of. After the war, he felt the pain of Shanghai elementary schools not having suitable teaching materials for optional English classes, so he compiled this book to meet the needs. He used great effort to compile this book, which can be seen from the overall structure, organization, and vocabulary.</p>
<p>There is one shortcoming in this book. The illustrations in both volumes are all in black, which inevitably detracts from the children's love of learning. If this Wen Tung English Primer were to have all color illustrations, like the American Learning to Read, it would be even more irresistible. We hope that within the possible scope of material production conditions, printing technology will be gradually improved, and the Wen Tung English Primer will become the most perfect English textbook in the country.</p>
<h3>A Judge's Story</h3>
<p>— Shao Xunmei</p>
<p>Book title: The Judge's Story p.218 Author: Charles Morgan Publisher: Macmillan &amp; Co London Price: Seven shillings and sixpence</p>
<p>Charles Morgan indeed occupies a special position in the British literary world. He has published five novels in total, and he has won the three most important literary awards in England. Each time he publishes a work, it always attracts everyone's serious attention and sells quite well, but some people often feel that it is difficult to read, but everyone admits that he is a first-class contemporary British writer.</p>
<p>Originally, since George Moore's death in 1931, many writers have wanted to inherit his two titles of "Master of Prose" and "Master of Storytelling." The most likely candidate was Somerset Maugham. His reputation, status, and achievements have been recognized by the world, but some people still criticize him for not being serious enough. There is also Aldous Huxley, but unfortunately his interest in philosophy, politics, and religion is as strong as his interest in literature; his novels, especially his recent works, often give you a confusing and complex feeling. In addition, there are two contestants who are orthodox disciples of George Moore. One is David Garnett, and the other is Morgan.</p>
<p>Garnett seems to be the youngest. His novel "Lady into Fox" won two literary awards at the same time. The literary world placed great hope on him. However, his later works, in order to excessively develop his talent for telling stories, rendered the simplest themes complex and vivid; because the basic story was too ordinary, in the end, the reader felt that his spirit was wasted, as if he had used all his heart and mind but received no reward.</p>
<p>We all know that George Moore's writing style has reached a state of perfection, as pure as an angel and as vivid as a spring. Although it has been revised and modified many times, it is natural without any trace. He also knows how to choose themes to match his writing style. His memoirs about the Irish literary movement have become a permanent monument in the British literary circle.</p>
<p>Morgan tells mostly modern stories. His writing style is too deeply influenced by George Moore, and there is a suspicion of deliberately showing off. This phenomenon is most obvious in "Sparkenbroke," so this novel is also the most unsuccessful. Of course, he himself also understands the foolishness of this style. To worship a hero does not necessarily mean abandoning one's own personality. "The Voyage," published in 1941, gradually moved away from this path. "The Judge's Story," which was recently published, can be said to be completely his own style.</p>
<p>"The Judge's Story" is not long. The entire book is only two hundred and eighteen pages, but it is as exquisite as a Keats' sonnet. The story has a whole philosophy, a perfect structure; the characters' personalities are all active in front of a real background; and the concise and intimate writing style appropriately matches the speed of the story's progress. This is a typical British work because only they have that leisurely abundance, rigorous temperament, and tenacious will. This work does not hope to exchange for a large amount of American dollars, but is striving for an immortal status. As the title of the book suggests, this novel tells the story of a retired judge. He has a pure personality, or a perfect soul. After resigning, he lives a clean and normal life. He plans to write a historical record of the lives of "virtuous people," and spends most of his time collecting and organizing materials. Opposing him is a wealthy industrial magnate, who has almost no personality or soul to speak of, so he is satisfied with destroying other people's personalities or souls. He wants to seduce those so-called "good people" into falling into depravity, and then try his best to rescue them from the trap, so that they can live again in gratitude to him, completely obeying his commands and arrangements. This is a devilish identity in the Bible. The judge has an adopted daughter. She is smart and beautiful. However, because she is overly active, she seems to have more than one personality or soul; driven by the environment and emotions, she will change her nature and color at any time. If it were not for the judge's hints and actions, she would almost let that industrialist grasp her soul. Her husband is also a "good person." He also has a personality or soul, but they are not obvious enough or complete enough. The industrialist does not think he is worth seducing, except that he may have a considerable influence on his wife. These different personalities are the backbone of this story.</p>
<p>In short, this novel is indeed rare in the modern publishing world, where commercial influence is extremely common. However, I always think that the atmosphere of philosophy and psychology is too heavy. If it were Maugham, he would let the story progress to explain everything, completely avoiding dry discussions and analysis.</p>

<h3>The Road of Intellectuals</h3>
<p>— Jingwen</p>
<p>The group of people who used to be called the scholar-official class and are now called intellectuals can be said to be the most suffering in modern society. People used to joke about scholar-officials with the saying, "A scholar's rebellion will not succeed in three years." Today, "A scholar is useless" has long become a footnote to the fate of all intellectuals.</p>
<p>However, a society without intellectuals is simply unimaginable. Especially in modern society, the word intellectual is not limited to so-called scholars. Anyone who belongs to the middle social class can be said to be an intellectual. What Europeans and Americans call the white-collar class, what we call the salaried class, and so-called freelancers are all the backbone of the intellectual class.</p>
<p>Since the theory of class struggle was first proposed, some people have not believed in the possibility of a so-called middle social class existing in this world, believing that there are no other social classes besides the bourgeoisie and the proletariat. Although there is a so-called petty bourgeoisie, its position is uncertain. It may be a "hanger-on" of the bourgeoisie, or it may be a "fellow traveler" of the proletariat.</p>
<p>This statement seems to make some sense at first glance because there are indeed many "helpers" who are either left-leaning or right-leaning among the so-called petty bourgeoisie. But we cannot deny a major fact because of this, that is, the middle social class has its own independent existence and strength, and is the leading force in all forms of society. Regardless of what kind of system a country or a society adopts for its economic life, the existence of the middle social class always plays a leading role.</p>
<p>This is not an exaggeration. When it comes to capitalist countries, Britain and the United States are of course representatives, but the pillars that make up British and American society are definitely not a few capitalists, but middle-class people who make up the absolute majority. The working class in British and American society naturally ranks first in terms of numbers, but their spiritual yearning is still centered on the middle-class society.</p>
<p>The Soviet Union was the first country to experiment with the so-called proletarian revolution, but the backbone of today's Soviet society is still the middle social class, with intellectuals as the leading center. Moreover, the Soviet Union's founding policy, in the final analysis, is nothing more than wanting to establish a country with the petty bourgeois class as its common foundation. The so-called proletarian dictatorship is just a political means used by some intellectuals to appeal to the masses. May I ask, which of Marx, Lenin, or even Stalin, was truly born into the so-called proletariat?</p>
<p>Isn't the situation in our country the same? Although many people look down on a long gown, how many people who wear a long gown are willing to take it off resolutely? And how many of those who have not yet worn a long gown are secretly hoping that they or their children will wear a long gown? Many people who work hard to make a living, usually save money on food and clothing, is his hope only in the four boards behind him? Definitely not, he wants to use his bare hands to climb up to the upper class of society, and what he considers to be the upper class in his mind is precisely the middle social class that everyone despises now, with intellectuals as the social backbone. The symbol of that is a long gown.</p>
<p>The saying that a scholar's rebellion will not succeed in three years may be used to mock some "reading officials," but it definitely cannot be applied to the broad intellectual class. May I ask, which major movement in ancient and modern history, at home and abroad, did not come from the promotion and leadership of intellectuals? And the stabilizing force of modern society belongs to the intellectual class.</p>
<p>The purpose of this short article is not to call for "rescuing intellectuals." Since intellectuals are the leading force in society, there is no need to call for rescue. Although the middle-class people in modern countries are suffering from the heavy pressure of life, there is no object to call for, and there can be no effect. The way out for intellectuals today or in the future is not to lean left or right, but to be able to firmly believe that they are the mainstay of society, uphold the belief of social justice, and become a stabilizing force to consolidate society in troubled times.</p>
<h3>Winter Vacation</h3>
<p>— Mang</p>
<p>Almost every composition in childhood had the words "Time flies like an arrow." Not only was I like this, but many classmates also liked to use these words to start, as if it wouldn't be a good composition without this sentence. In fact, at that time, time did not fly like an arrow. I only hated that the days passed slowly. I couldn't wait for today to pass New Year's Day, and after a while, it would be the end of the twelfth lunar month, because the happiest time was during the New Year.</p>
<p>Now it's different. Instead, I feel that the days are passing too quickly. I clearly remember the situation when I came to school at the beginning of the semester, and now it's time for vacation again. Perhaps there are still many people who think that these few months have passed slowly, but I think that these few months have passed too quickly. Now I deserve to use the words "Time flies like an arrow."</p>
<p>The students all hope that the winter vacation will come soon, so they can go home for the New Year. I only hate having this winter vacation. However, this is a feeling that I only had this semester. In the past, I also had a strong desire for the winter vacation.</p>
<p>Maybe I'm too selfish, thinking that because I don't want to go home for the New Year, I don't want to have a winter vacation. This is true. I hope there is no winter vacation because the winter vacation doesn't give me happiness, it gives me sorrow. Worry about the tuition fees, miscellaneous fees, and meal fees for the next semester...</p>
<p>The winter vacation also gives me distress. When I go back to my home (which is not really my own home), I have to see my father's worried face and hear my mother's sad sighs. Worried faces, sad sighs! When can they turn into happy smiles and joyful cheers?</p>
<p>Walking out of the school gate, I was secretly sad. After walking for a while, I often turned back to look at the neat classrooms. I was reluctant to leave them because I didn't know if I could be with them again in a month.</p>
<p>How annoying the winter vacation is!</p>
<h3>A Worthy Opponent</h3>
<p>— Lei Hong</p>
<p>There was a Quaker merchant who loaded a ship with goods in the old days of sailing ships and transported them to other ports. He hadn't received news of arrival for a long time, so he thought it had been lost. The merchant went to another friend, Jones, who was also a Quaker and an insurance broker. He asked Jones to insure the ship and was willing to pay a high premium.</p>
<p>The insurance broker thought for a while and said to the merchant, "Friend, please write down the details and let me take them back and consider them overnight. I'll give you an answer tomorrow." The merchant wrote a note and left.</p>
<p>That night, the merchant received bad news that the ship had indeed been lost. He didn't know if Jones had already decided to accept this insurance business. He turned the matter over in his mind all night. If he had already signed the note, he could get insurance compensation—if he hadn't signed, everything would be over.</p>
<p>So, early the next morning, he wrote a note and sent it to the insurance broker's office, which read: "To my brother Jones: I have learned that the ship is safe. Regarding the matter I begged you to do yesterday, if you have not signed the note, please have the bearer bring it back."</p>
<p>The insurance broker thought the ship was safe. In order to collect the huge insurance premium as soon as possible, he quickly signed the insurance policy and gave it to the messenger to take back.</p>
<h3>On "Officials Don't Repair Government Offices"</h3>
<p>— Maogong</p>
<p>According to Hu Shi, Xiong Bing argued against "officials not repairing government offices" during his lifetime because he lacked constructive ideas. Regardless of whether the old officials not repairing government offices was truly an expression of a lack of constructive minds, according to my foolish thoughts, officials who do not repair government offices are better than those who do.</p>
<p>The reason is actually simple. The purpose of officials repairing government offices is not necessarily for so-called construction, just as officials riding in cars is not for the convenience of transportation. If an impetuous reporter visits an official who is repairing a government office and asks, "Why do you want to repair your government office?" The most plausible answer would probably be no more than "to enhance the appearance." Enhancing the appearance is certainly not construction, and if it is not construction, it is certainly not worth supporting or endorsing. No, no, because they want to enhance the appearance, they should actually be opposed.</p>
<p>What is called enhancing the appearance? Isn't it just showing off or acting mysteriously? In the imperial era, the palaces and halls of the emperors were built magnificently and beautifully. The intention, in addition to personal enjoyment, was to enhance the appearance, that is, to scare the common people. Who says that the construction of the Afang Palace by a certain emperor and the construction of the Summer Palace by a certain emperor were for construction? The construction cost of the Summer Palace, however, was misappropriated from the funds for building the navy. However, in the era of emperors, "I am the state," and they can do whatever they want. What can we common people say?</p>
<p>What is strange is that the people's servants in democratic countries also like palaces quite a bit. Take the most democratic United States as an example. The president may be a commoner who grew up in a small wooden house, but the president's office must be the magnificent White House (of course, the word "palace" is our translation, and the fault is not theirs). We have probably all used servants, or we will use them one day. Would we put the best room in the house for the servants to live in? I am not very clear about the situation in the United States, but it would not be wrong to say that Mr. Truman's bedroom and study must be more exquisite than the servants'. Today, people in democratic countries are all suffering from a housing shortage, moving houses, and floating houses. No matter how many tricks there are, there are still people sleeping in the open, while their servants are very comfortable in the White House, Black House, and magnificent halls. Is this called a democratic country, the people's century? Are you deceiving people or dogs?</p>
<p>You may say that public servants are different from private servants. Public servants are those who govern the country and pacify the world, and they must be well served, otherwise their spirits will be affected due to material discomfort, and if they mess up the country a little, it will cause disaster to the people. I say that is not the case. First of all, the importance of private servants to us is no less than that of public servants. We tell the cooks to sleep in the stove room. Are we not afraid that their lives will be bad and their spirits will be bad, so they will put arsenic instead of MSG? Secondly, whether public servants work conscientiously and whether they are determined to benefit the country and the people has nothing to do with whether they live in tall buildings. No, no, public servants who want to live in good houses are definitely less conscientious and less determined to save the world than those who do not want to live in good houses. The appointment of public servants is not for earning money like the appointment of maids. Most of them are determined to save the people from suffering, unlike what is said in old novels, "Traveling thousands of miles to become an official is only for money." Therefore, in terms of diet and daily life, they should not seek anything too good. If there is a public servant who refuses to go to work without an eighteen-story or twenty-seven-story building, what kind of political achievements do you think he will have after taking office?</p>
<p>Even if we take a step back and say that the size and beauty of the government office is the respect of the people and not created by the officials, I think the people's servants should also resign at this time and say: How many people in the country have no place to live? I really feel uneasy working in such a big government office. Therefore, until the people have at least a snail's house each, I will definitely work in the open air...</p>
<h3>The Mystery of the Palace of Eternal Life</h3>
<p>— Wang Baili</p>
<p>The legend of the Palace of Eternal Life, performed on the national day of mourning in the Kangxi year of Dingmao (corresponding to the 26th year of Kangxi), offended many people. This point is consistently recorded in books such as Wu Mei's "Gu Qu Chen Tan," Wang Dongxu's "Liu Nan Bi Ji," and Ruan Wushan's "Cha Yu Ke Hua," leaving no room for doubt. However, the performance on the national day of mourning was merely the headline accusation; the details beneath the surface are where the real story lies. These details vary in different accounts. For the sake of clarity, I will transcribe two different versions below for reference.</p>
<p>"Liu Nan Sui Bi" states: "During the years of Kangxi Dingmao and Wuchen, the actors of the capital's Liyuan troupe considered the Neiju Troupe as the best. At that time, Hong Fangsi, a student of the Qiantang Hongtaixue, had just completed the play 'The Palace of Eternal Life' and taught it to the Neiju Troupe to perform. The Holy Ancestor watched it and praised it, granting the actors twenty taels of silver. He also commended it to the princes. Consequently, all princes and cabinet ministers had the play performed at their banquets. The 'red packets' they received were the same amount as the imperial gift. The actors of the Neiju Troupe gained a considerable amount, and they reported to Hong, saying, 'Thanks to your new work, we have received many rewards. We invite you to a banquet and perform the play to accompany the wine. We will invite all your friends to come as well.' They chose a date and prepared the feast, holding a grand gathering at the Shengyuan Garden, inviting all the famous figures in the capital. However, Zhao Xingzhan (Zhao Zhengjie) of our county (i.e., Changshu) was not invited. Zhao was working at the residence of Censor Wang, and he spoke to Wang, urging him to submit a memorial, saying that the day was the Empress Dowager's death anniversary, and holding a banquet with music was a great disrespect. He requested that they be punished according to the law. The Emperor read the memorial and ordered the Ministry of Justice to imprison them. Nearly fifty scholars and students were removed from their positions. Zhao Zan-shan Shenfu (Zhixin) of Yidu, and Cha Taixue Xia Chong (Silian) of Haining, were among the most prominent. Later, Cha changed his name to Shenxing and passed the imperial examinations, while Zhao remained unemployed for the rest of his life."</p>
<p>"Cha Yu Ke Hua" states: "Zhao Qiugu Zhixin was impeached and dismissed by Censor Huang Dahong for attending a performance of 'The Palace of Eternal Life' at Hong Fangsi's residence during the national mourning period of Dingmao. Xu Shengli, an editor of Jia Yan, was also at the banquet. During the interrogation, he bribed the actors of the Juhe Troupe to falsely claim that he was not present, and was thus spared. The people of the capital had a saying: 'Although the mourning robes have been removed, the mourning period is not yet over. How can one enter the theater? One has three parts of fault, do not blame old Huang for the impeachment. Qiugu's talent is unmatched, a promising young scholar; alas, a single performance of 'The Palace of Eternal Life' ended his career! The Zhou Wang Temple priest is frivolous, also indulging in the "Palace of Eternal Life". Shaking out incense money to seek escape, tailoring costumes in the Juhe Troupe.' Xu Jianyi had a beautiful beard, and was referred to as Zhou Zishi. He later became an academician. It is said that Censor Huang was selected for a position in the capital by the Zhixian, and gave local products and poetry manuscripts to many famous scholars. When it came to Qiugu, he replied with a note saying: 'Local products are gratefully received, the manuscripts are respectfully returned.' Huang hated him to the core, hence the impeachment."</p>
<p>In summary, not only do the surnames of the impeaching censor differ ("Wang" and "Huang") (hereafter temporarily referred to as Huang), but also the location of the performance, one being Shengyuan Garden, the other being Hong Fangsi's residence; the troupe name, one being "Neiju," the other being "Juhe," also differs. Furthermore, the reasons for the impeachment differ significantly. One is Zhao Xingzhan's displeasure at being excluded from the invitation, urging Huang to submit a memorial. The other is Huang Dahong's resentment toward Qiugu for the insult of "respectfully returning the manuscripts." In ordinary circumstances, "Cha Yu Ke Hua" seems more plausible: Huang felt extremely slighted by Qiugu's "respectfully returning the manuscripts," and therefore hated him to the core. This was Huang's personal matter. Zhao Xingzhan's urging would only be a minor annoyance to Huang, not something that would pain him to the core. However, even though Huang hated Qiugu to the core, Qiugu was merely one of the invited guests, not the organizer of the performance. It seems unlikely that Huang would be so ruthless as to implicate all the famous figures present out of hatred for one invited guest. My opinion is that Zhao Xingzhan expressed his resentment to Huang, and Huang happened to use Qiugu's presence at the scene as an opportunity to vent his old grudges. Such coincidences often occur. However, this is just my speculation and should not be taken as definitive. I will leave it for learned scholars to investigate.</p>
<h3>Congratulations to Mr. Shougao Chuiwan on His Seventieth Birthday</h3>
<p>— Yao Yuanzhu</p>
<p>Yan Zhou admired Xi Fu in his later years, praising his abilities as surpassing Han and Ou. Fang and Yao continued the tradition in succession, their names and virtues equally matched. Wangxi in the middle faced many hardships, encountering literary persecution. He cherished Zhongshan and lectured, but who could keep him from the honors? For twenty years, he followed Master Zhenchuan, reluctantly serving as a low-ranking official before retiring. He read books and drank water in leisure, interacting with his neighbors. His writing could move people's emotions, inspiring deep contemplation. His sentences were smooth and clear, avoiding sensationalism, exploring what others found difficult to express. Mr. Gao excelled in writing at a young age, and Fang and Yao's works stirred the nation. Scholars brought their writings and wine, eager to learn from his wisdom. He often composed elegant poems, spreading his fame to distant corners. He never held an official position, enjoying a carefree life on his ten acres of mulberry fields. Alas, the world is in chaos, the rivers and lakes offer no peace. He has retreated to a corner, abandoning half of his possessions, entrusting his books to a boat in Nantang. Now he lives in a rented house, his mind still filled with the essence of books. Though far from Tongcheng and Kunshan, the waters of Anting are clear and bright. Try climbing Ma'an to commemorate Xiang Ji, find pleasure and peace in the scenery. In this small room, he transcends the world, studying countless books, exploring the depths of knowledge. His words are sincere, his figure thin, but his spirit is complete, his eyes clear. He does not need strange and extravagant things to withstand the cold. The green bamboos contain the wind's strength. I know he still has thousands of poems hidden away, precious treasures. I offer this short composition to express my admiration, daring to present my humble work.</p>
<h3>Heyang Pork and Huishan Spring Water</h3>
<p>— Tan Zhengbi</p>
<p>Having grown accustomed to hearing "the moon is always better in foreign countries," I can't help but recall two stories. Not only are they strikingly similar, but they also echo each other across different eras.</p>
<p>One story concerns the great Song Dynasty writer Su Dongpo, recorded in Pan Changji's "Song Biao Lei Chao," volume seven. It recounts Dongpo's own experience: "When I was in Qixia, I heard that the pork from Heyang was particularly delicious, so I sent someone to buy it. The messenger got drunk, and the pig escaped at night. He bought another pig to replace it. The guests were all amazed, thinking it was beyond what other places could produce. Later, the truth came out, and the guests were greatly disappointed." "Song Biao Lei Chao" is a compilation that draws from Song Dynasty notebooks, so this account is naturally taken from one of those notebooks. However, the modern scholar Ding Chuanjing's "Song Ren Yi Shi Hui Bian" also cites this passage, sourcing it from "Song Biao Lei Chao," indicating that the original source is now difficult to trace.</p>
<p>The other story concerns Qiu Changru of Macheng in the Ming Dynasty, found in Yuan Hongdao's "Yuan Zhonglang Ji," in the essay "After Reading Zhang Youyu's Poem on Huiquan": "My friend Qiu Changru of Macheng traveled east to Wu and Hui, carrying thirty jugs of Huishan spring water. When the boat reached Dafeng, Changru returned first, ordering his servants to carry it back. The servants, disliking the weight, secretly poured it into the river. Only when they reached Daoguan River did they refill the jugs with river water. Changru, unaware, was extremely proud of it. The next day, he invited all the connoisseurs in the city to taste the water. The connoisseurs arrived as scheduled, sitting together in the studio, looking very pleased. He took out the wine vessel, filled porcelain cups with a small amount, passed them around for discussion, and then drank it. After smelling and examining it for a long time, they slowly savored it, making gurgling sounds in their throats. Then they looked at each other and exclaimed, 'How wonderful! What water! If not for Changru's generosity, how would we have the chance to drink this water in our lives?' They all sighed with admiration and left. Half a month later, the servants quarreled, revealing each other's secrets. Changru was furious and dismissed his servants. The connoisseurs who had drunk the water heard of this, and could only sigh in shame." Zhonglang's prose is known for its humor. This passage is particularly representative, vividly depicting the serious demeanor of the connoisseurs while drinking the water, with tremendous force. When the truth is revealed, Changru is furious, and the guests are ashamed. Readers can't help but laugh.</p>
<p>In fact, readers need not laugh. There are many similar things in the world, too many to count. "The moon is always better in foreign countries" has long become a popular saying. Even currency is better in foreign countries, and banks are better in foreign countries. That's why the price of American dollars keeps rising, and Chinese deposits in foreign banks only increase, never being repatriated. Take our own bank as an example: If the same words come from the mouth or pen of someone hailed as an authority, aren't they considered golden rules, and no one can criticize or oppose them?</p>
<p>However, Heyang pork and Huishan spring water, in the mouths of those without discernment, may indeed be indistinguishable from the real thing. But in reality, they have some differences from the ordinary. As for modern people's belief that everything foreign is good, and everything said by authorities is right, this so-called "good" and "right" deserves further study. What is the truth? We'll have to wait for the next installment. We can't draw conclusions just yet.</p>
<p>Many years ago, I included Yuan Hongdao's article in a "Chinese Reader" for middle school students. There was a sentence that read, "This matter is similar to the Heyang pork incident of Dongpo." At the time, I couldn't find the reference to "Heyang pork," so this was the only allusion in the entire book that wasn't annotated. Later, a careful reader specifically wrote to me to ask about it. I honestly told him and promised to inform him as soon as I found out. Who knew that by the time I found out, I had lost his contact information, leaving me unable to tell him. I was very disappointed! Now I am adding this note here, treating it as an open letter to the readers of my "Chinese Reader," and also writing down some of the thoughts I've had.</p>
<h3>Treasure Hunting</h3>
<p>— Bronze Camel</p>
<p>In the United States, there are groups dedicated to unearthing ancient treasures. Anyone can do it, as long as they have two sets of gardening tools, endless optimism—and a place to dig. The U.S. Antiquities Department already has records of hundreds of potential treasure locations, including pirate caches, sunken treasure ships, and hidden valuables. The pursuit of ready-made wealth is said to be "a truly flourishing American industry." Searching for just one unsubstantiated Arizona mine draws no fewer than seven thousand treasure hunters from around the world.</p>
<p>In 1911, the mail ship Merida sank off the coast of Charles Cape, carrying gold bars, silver bricks, and the jewels from the crown of the deposed Mexican Emperor Maximilian. Rockefeller and Beattle obtained the excavation rights and set about searching for the sunken ship. They found nothing, instead, they spent $500,000. But this kind of record did not discourage treasure hunters. The only reason is that there is a rich "history of success" to encourage them.</p>
<p>A writer and photographer from Boston named Snow has been searching for hidden treasures for twenty years, but without success. Before the war, he heard a story from a sailor named John: A hundred years ago, a mysterious figure came to Boston and found a job as a butler. According to rumors on the docks, the mysterious butler had been a pirate. The man later died in 1882 without revealing his secret. Twenty years later, someone claiming to be the pirate's brother told Sailor John that the pirate had a map buried on Great Brewster Island, according to which a box of treasure could be found.</p>
<p>Now, forty-five years later, Snow heard the story and went to Brewster Island to search. Although the map was not found, he did find a cipher in a wrecked ship, which revealed that the pirate's loot was on Strong Island, outside "Pants Pocket Corner."</p>
<p>Snow rushed there, bringing the necessary equipment, such as shovels and testers sensitive to metal objects. On the sixth dig, they heard the shovel hit a metal box. They dug up two tarnished bronze boxes, and opened them to find a box full of gold coins!</p>
<p>What kept gold diggers hopeful was seeing the family of Board in Florida and made their conviction firmer. It is said that Board's banking business, metal industry, and real estate all started with the discovery of a basket of gold. The pair of boxes was buried by a pirate, La Tuotuo, at the mouth of the Suwannee River. At that time, Board's grandfather ran a sawmill, and a friend gave his grandfather a treasure map. Board followed the map and succeeded in one fell swoop, laying the foundation for their family and business.</p>
<p>Everyone thought the US government owned half of the treasure uncovered, but that's not true. It is said that the government's tax can't exceed 25 percent, and some are as low as 10 percent. But the government has the right to purchase the gold found with cash.</p>
<h3>Carefree Flower</h3>
<p>— Chen Shenyan</p>
<p>Chapter Nine: Leaking Secrets (56)</p>
<p>Mrs. Zhang said, "If you don't want to ask, then don't ask. Don't be angry." After saying that, she showed a loving and tolerant expression, smiling gently at Zhuzhai, and then got up and left. Yunqing cried for a while, and the anger and frustration in her heart had dissipated, so she was not as impulsive as before. Then, she picked up Qihuan's photo again and looked at it again. She thought to herself that it would be better to return the photo to him. Keeping it would make it seem like she was investigating his whereabouts, which would only make him wary. Moreover, she couldn't bring down Zhusu with just a few photos. If his heart has changed, it would be even worse to reveal it. I absolutely cannot let that happen. It would be my lifelong regret. Zhuzhai is now obsessed with Qihuan. These singing girls are fickle by nature. Even if Zhuzhai can marry her, it would be a lifelong burden. I must also point him in the right direction so that he can escape from the sea of ​​misery. Yunqing is the most careful and considerate. After thinking about it repeatedly, she calmed down and put Zhuzhai's photo back in his coat pocket. She tiptoed to Zhuzhai's bed to take a look. She saw Zhuzhai leaning his head against the pillow, sleeping soundly. His cheeks were flushed with wine, making him even more handsome. She thought that it was a pity that this person's heart had changed and he was no longer mine! Thinking of this, she didn't want to look at him anymore and returned to her room. She lay on the bed, thinking over and over again, but she couldn't fall asleep. She felt that her hopes were empty. Seeing Zhuzhai and Qihuan getting together, she was really unwilling. Zhuzhai used her to persuade Fengsheng to get a divorce. Now, what can I do to make Qihuan not want to marry Zhuzhai? I have no friendship with Qihuan, so it would be presumptuous to go to her house. Not only would Qihuan not believe me, but if Zhuzhai found out, he would be even more disgusted. This is definitely not an option. As for persuading Zhuzhai, he is obsessed with Qihuan and has no ability to judge right from wrong. It would be useless to talk to him. At this time, the only solution is to tell Fengsheng and let her, in the name of Zhuzhai's legitimate wife, negotiate with Qihuan. They are actresses, so they have the greatest vanity. If they see the wife come to their door to tell them, they will never want to be a mistress. In this way, perhaps their union can be broken up. That night, Yunqing thought about this over and over again and couldn't sleep. Until eight o'clock the next morning, Zhuzhai woke up, had some refreshments, and came in to tell Yunqing that he was going to work. Yunqing was hesitant to say anything. When she saw him, she couldn't say a word. Mrs. Zhang was a straightforward person. Seeing that Zhuzhai was about to leave, she called him into the house and asked him if he planned to get married in the future. She also expressed her willingness to marry Yunqing to him. Zhuzhai was very embarrassed when Mrs. Zhang suddenly raised this question. He couldn't answer for a while and could only stammer, "I haven't considered this matter yet, and there are still problems in the family. It's impossible to talk about this right now."</p>

<p>Reader Consultation, Legal Clarifications</p>
<h3>Refusal to Redeem Sold Rice Paddy, Dispute Over Rent Paid in Rice</h3>
<p>[Mr. Wang Sihan asks] A, Mr. A, sold several acres of rice paddy to B twenty years ago, with a contract as proof. However, the sold field is still cultivated by A nearby, and he only pays B interest every year. The sales contract states, "The field can be redeemed at the original price within five years." The redemption period has expired, and A has died. Since the Anti-Japanese War, he has not paid interest. The sales contract also states, "If interest is not paid in any year, the owner shall take charge of the property in accordance with the contract and hire another tenant." According to Article 380 of the Civil Code, the seller may not buy back after the five-year period has expired. Is it applicable to this case? B, can A's son sue the court to order B to return the field sold by his father, which he has occupied and refused to return? C, does A's son have any legal basis for redeeming the sold field now? D, is B legally justified in sending a letter stating that he is withdrawing the original agreement to redeem the field, based on Article 380 of the Civil Code?</p>
<p>The rent is paid in rice, and the tenant has formally signed the lease. However, the council has recently resolved that rent cannot be paid in rice, so the tenant refuses to pay in rice. What should be done?</p>
<p>[Legal Answer by Mr. Tang Mingshi] A. Article 380 of the Civil Code does not say that it cannot be bought back; it is not applicable here. If it is a pledge right, the term is 30 years (Civil Code Article 912), and if the agreed term is less than 15 years, it cannot be attached with a clause that it is an absolute sale if not redeemed upon expiration (Civil Code Article 913). Furthermore, according to Article 923, paragraph 2, of the Civil Code, if the pledger does not redeem the pledged object at the original pledge price after two years from the expiration of the pledge period, the pledgee shall obtain ownership of the pledged object. (B) Since the land is said to have been absolutely sold, but the sales contract also states the time limit for redemption at the original price, the ownership and pledge rights are confused. If the sales contract is valid, it is a problem of eviction; if it is a pledge right, it is a problem of redemption. It all depends on the evidence. (C) Determine the basis by calculating the time in accordance with the above articles. (D) The notice is of course valid.</p>
<p>According to the principle of freedom of contract, once a contract is signed, it must be performed in accordance with the contract. There is no explicit prohibition of rent paid in rice in current law.</p>
