<h3 id="c29">社論　如保確保經管的成功？ <a href="#c29" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e29" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">29</a></h3>
<p>—獻給上海區第一次經管會議—</p>
<p>上海經濟管制區擴大地區後，京，滬，蘇，浙，院二市三　，今天在首都舉行第一次經濟管制會議，除了討論物資的控制與日用品的配給問題外，並將檢討二市三省經濟管制的聯繫問題，二市市長曁三省主席，均將親自參加討論，足見這一次經濟會議的重要。尤其在各地都市先後發生搶購風潮，而上海勢將形成經濟孤島的今日，我們對於一一市三省召開第一次經濟管制會議，自然格外重視。</p>
<p>我國這次實行幣制改革，誰都承認它的成敗，不特有　全國四億五千萬人民的生死，而且也是國家民族榮辱興　的關鍵，所以不論朝野對於這次幣制改革；無不抱着「只許成功，不許失敗」的期望。但是幣制改革的成功，一半有賴幣制改革後經濟管制的方法，而一半更有賴於改革方案本身的健全。當然，政府大負一定要說方案本身是勇敢而有力的，是周密而妥適的，成功與否乃在人民的信仰擁護如何。而在一般人民，最初一個月內可以說得是竭誠擁護的了，尤其是上海的市民。但在學者專家則在憂慮方案本身的若干漏洞如何補救。此在政府自然要用管制方法來補救了。所以當局自始至終就特別重視經濟管制的加强。除在行政院設立經濟管制委員會而外，並在滬，穗，津，渝四大都市，設置經濟管制督導員，常駐各地督導，以推行安定經濟的各項措置；尤其重視上海區的經濟管制，派兪鴻鈞將經國二氏駐滬督導。當然大家都以爲上海是全國工商業的中心，投機囤積的淵藪，過去每次物價的飛漲，漲風總是從上海吹到各地的，只要把上海區的經濟管制得好，各地的物價自會向上海看齊。雖有若干限光較遠的人指出，經濟事情未必如此簡單，上海固可影響內地，內地也可打擊上海。然而言者醇醇，聽者藐藐。但是一個半月來的事實，究竟如何，現在有目共觀了。</p>
<p>上海區的經濟管制，在蔣督導員的鐵腕下，撲滅黑市，根除投機取締囤積，調節物資供應，檢查存貨數量，扼守「八·一九」的限價防綫，不能不說上海區的經濟管制初步獲得極大的成功。然試放眼看看渝，民，穗，平，津各地的物價，在幣制改革後的一個半月內，都　已漲起一倍到三午，雖然「向上海看齊」，「跟蔣經國氏學習」的呼聲，幾乎到處可聞，但到底着齊了沒有？對於蔣督導員管制經濟的工作，我們實在萬分欽似，但同時也萬分替他憂慮。上海物價四十多天的暫時穩定，雖未能將上海市民從水深火熱中完全拯救出來，但至少已使在高物價壓迫之下的老百姓，獲得了一個喘息的機會。何况蔣氏硬幹快幹實幹的態度及其熱心爲人民服務的精神，不僅司以一新全國的耳目，而且可以樹立一種政治的新作風，在收拾人心方面當能發生極大的作用。在「人心思變」的今日，蔣督導員在上海的表現，不使可視爲「新政」的起點，而且也可目爲全國人民希望的明燈。我們之所以萬分欽佩者在此；然而我們之所以萬分憂慮者也在此。</p>
<p>為什麼要憂慮呢？其原因有三：</p>
<p>第一上海區經濟的力量不夠。蔣　督導員在滬掃行其經管工作，事業上是荊棘滿途的，在他的四週，還潛伏着許多敵人他們都在有意有意的時時想衝破這一道「八一九」的防綫，大有所謂「道高一尺，魔高一丈」之感。因此，上海物價雖仍扼守「八一九」的第一道防綫，但也不可否認的，上海已成了經濟上的孤島！目前上海市與各地經濟的隔離，工商界人心的消沉，以及各工廠的减工，已使生產顯示出萎縮的現象。同時，游資的鬆濫，已使「八一九」的防綫岌岌可危。又因市民「重物輕幣」的心理，死灰復燃，上海也發生搶購浪潮。這種惡劣情形，如聽其自然演變下去，不僅各地的物價不能向上海看齊，恐怕上將有被迫而向各地物價看齊之虞了。原來經濟事業，如環無端，彼此息息相關，計會相互聯帶，決無「投鞭斷流」之可能。蔣督導員在上海區的經管工作，至多也祗能擴大到二市三省，姑無論二市三省如何展開其經管工作，齊一步伐，就算做得搬上海市一個半月一樣的好，然而二市三省以外又如何？故上海區經管的成功，不能使恃上海區一區之力，不能徒恃戡建大隊若干隊員之力，更不能專恃蔣督導一人之力，而實有賴於全國全面之經管工作如何密切配合，如何加强力量。</p>
<p>第二，政府至今還沒有切實鼓勵增加生產的事實表現，但想靠了貼腕來永久維持限價，太使蔣督導員爲難了。嚴格執行限價，譬如狂熱的病人用冰袋，失眠的病人用安眠藥，心臟衰弱的病人打強心針，這是一時臺標之計而已，要治病源是不能徒恃這此藥物的。但是政府一個半月來，除了請大夫用這些方法治療而外，有過什麼力量，來都助農產口和工廠製成品的增加？相反的，祗想用硬性限價的方法把農產品的價格壓下去，用硬性限制的方法阻　了工廠原料的來源，杜絕了工廠成品的去路，使一個工業都市和內地農村在經濟上脫節起來，如何會使生產增加呢？生產不增，而消費無限。經濟管制工作的前途，我午很替上海區擔憂的。</p>
<p>第三，中樞大員至今不但沒有把握平衡國庫的收支，沒有勇氣實行維護金圓幣値的方法，反而時時濫發議論、刺激人民對於金圓的信任。須知經濟改革方案的重心，不僅在改革幣制，而尤重在平衡國家預算，否則法幣換了金圓，政府如果依然只恃發行，試問如何了局？金圓總額二十億元，九月底巳發到九意多，玫府究竟打算怎樣收回大量金圓，或以後少發金圓？出售國營事業的股票，不肯按單位各別命售·而要籠統的發售幾成；能收什麽效果？改售股票，而又不准交易所開市，試問買股票的人一旦有急需又將如何？人民已把大量的金銀外幣繳兌金圓，而政府至今選沒有硬輔幣發出來以取信。又沒有勇氣敢把收進去的大量金銀外幣和政府早已掌握的金銀外匯，一併移充外匯基金讓八民於正當需要如講備生產原料機器及日用必需品時，可用金圓券向中央銀行兌換外匯，以堅定人民對於金圓價值的信任，那又怎麼容易可以驟然改換人民重物輕幣的變態心理？何况我們的王財長在美國對記者公開談話，說我們二三年中需要美援每年五億元方可平衡收支，如果所傳不處，不是反而公然在和金圓券開玩笑嗎？稅收沒有勇氣整頓，交通公用事業價格又沒有勇氣調整，依然要國庫大量貼補，公教人員待遇又勢非增加不可，如此這般，國庫收支究竟何日可以平衡？這一點如做不到，是一切艱難的根本所在；但　望上海區經管的成功功，似乎示免所望太奢吧。</p>
<p>因此，我午以為確保經管的成功，其關鐵決不在上海一區，而在中央的決策，在全國的執行！</p>

<p>〔合衆社東京六日電〕高級政府官員六日稱：組閣七閱月之蘆田內開，將亦七日晨舉行緊急會議後辭職，此係昭和公司大貪汚案發展之結果。政府方面稱：蘆田之決定辭職，係在社會民主黨於六日下午舉行中央執行委員會決定撤銷對內閣之支持後發出，社會民主黨爲內閣三大支柱之一，該黨在前內閣副總理西尾在六日淸晨被捕後，卽舉行中執會，討論內閣之地位。該黨左翼份子在經濟安定本部長官栗梄在上週被捕後，卽「要求內閣辭職」。西尾雖爲該黨領袖之一，但數月前渠卽以接受營造商贈款案而辭去內閣副首相之職位，此次則又捲入昭和公司案中。該黨領袖六日票決：由於閣員被捕對公衆道義上之責任，要求政府辭職。蘆田在六日晚召集三政府黨領袖會商，據稱：內閣除辭職外，巳無他途可循。在此次會議中，社會民主黨首賴片山哲，早已決定要求內閣辭職，如蘆田加以拒絕，則該黨將退出內閣，該黨在內閣中佔據六省，此種行動當然將決定蘆田內閣之命運。</p>

<p>親愛的上海同胞們：自從政府頒佈財政經濟緊急處分令以來，巳經四十一天了。在這短短的時間內，政府實行了幣制的改革，穩定了風狂上漲的物價，這是政府與人民同心協力共同努力所得的結果。但這不過是實行新經濟政策的初步成功，爲了要鞏固和發展這初步的成功，我們還須繼續努力，使能達成安定社會，改善人民生活的目的。上海市民在過去一月中，曾向國家兌換了一百一十萬零五千六百五十二兩黃金，三千二百八十萬零三千八百九十四元美鈔，再加上白銀銀元及港幣，總共合於金圓券三億七千二百萬圓，拿全國兌換總數來說，巳佔總數百分之六十四，從這個數目字看來，就可看到上海市民，是如何擁護政府改革幣制的政策，充實了金圓券的準備金，使幣制改革的成功，得到了更大的保障。今後政府必須加强經濟管制工作，使物價得到長期的穩定，人民的生活，亦因此而能安定下去。</p>
<p>定能達到增產目我</p>
<p>我們要求物價的穩定，第一，要政府預算收支平衝；第二，要增加生產，供求相稱，第三，要實行節約减少消費，第四，要取締囤積，消滅黑市。政府爲國家的生存，正在從事於戡亂，所有一切開支，自然相當浩大，爲了增加收入，勢必整理稅收。最近政府增加烟酒稅，就是使收支平衡的重要實施，爲求得物價的安定，凡是能影響人民生活的必需品，幷未加稅。關於增加生產，現在政府正在設法帮助各工廠採購國內國外的原料，就上海現存已有的原料說來，有許多種類的存量，也是很充分的。現在的間題是要設法使游資投到生產方面去，這種工作，目前雖然有許多困難，但等到經濟上了正軌以徒，一定能達成增加生產的目的。不過，我們要知道一方面要增加生產，但同時也要實行節約，使消費减少，希望全體市民都能節衣縮食，來度過今天的難關，幷抱定自力更生的精神，來建設我們的國家。我們所要實行的配給制度，一方面是爲安定生活，同時一方面也是爲節省消費。囤積投機的行爲，是使市塲紊亂的因素，在過去一個半月中，經濟管制當局，採取了最嚴厲的方法，取締了黑市買賣，及一切其他投機行爲，今後當要繼繽防止投機行爲的復活，投機行爲一日不取消，物價就一日不能穩定。今後無論任何人，如果違反政府經濟管制的法令，政府一定繼續依法嚴辦，所以希望人民與政府更能密切合作，來消滅投機市塲。管制經濟的最後目的，是使工商業能走上正軌。在八一九以前，上海商業行莊的存款，拿金圓券來算，不過六百萬圓，但最近存款已經增加到二億金圓。八一九以前的利息至少是七角，但現在已跌至五六分了。拿一個很小的事情來說，因爲投機行爲的取締，上海市民在上月所用電話的次數，較之八月份的次數已滅少百分之四十·這些事實，都證明上海經濟芷走上正常化的道路，如脂將大景行莊的存款。用在生產上面去，那就是更進一步的成功。</p>
<p>堅守「八一九」限價</p>
<p>最近數天來，一股市民終日惶惶，到處購買物資，不但呢絨，毛絨綫，布疋，有人大量的購買，甚至錫箔，也有人大量的收購，這種心理，是很不正常的。昨大有一個朋友吿訴我，他巳經買了廿五石米，還買了許多豆油，煤炭，肥皂，一年之內，可以不怕了，這種觀念是絕對錯誤的，試問你一家有飯吃，如果一千一萬人沒有飯吃，你能安安靜靜的吃嗎！這種觀念，不僅是錯誤，而且是愚蠢，這種朱門酒肉臭，路有凍死骨的現象是決不允許的，政府曾經聲明，除了烟酒加稅以外，其餘貨物並未加稅，而且日用必需品價格，一定要嚴格維持「八一九」的限價。同時在上海的存貨，還是相當的充裕，我可以吿訴大家，上海的棉布，計有六百五十萬疋紗有十萬件，油有廿萬担，糖有八萬噸，至於米，除了政府每月配給五十萬祖外，由米商應市的米不過只要廿五萬石罷了。政府配給米的來源，不但十月，卽十一·十二月所需數量，據楊綽庵先生表示，亦不成問題。現在各米店所登記的存米，約有廿餘萬石，雜糧還不在內，此外政府尙委託農民銀行，中央合作金庫，在湖南·江西·四川等地購米，來供應上海市塲，今年的年成又是相當的鹽收，所以目前來源，雖不甚暢達，但決不致有任何問題發生。這樣看來，上海市民正可以安心，用不到怕什麼。今天所怕的，不是貨慌而是心慌，一方面政府嚴管物價，一方面人民都能安分守已，那末供給人民所用的必需品，決不致發生問題。最要緊的，還是要大家都安心，不聽謠言而驚慌。最近政府爲實行全面經濟管制，將上海區管制範國擴大至江蘇·浙江，安徽及南京等省市，相信在擴大範圍內的物炎調劑及物價的管制，將更聽收到良好的效果。我今天可以老老實實奉吿全上海的市民，管制物價，調劑物資，確是相當的困難。譬如關於小菜塲的整理，我們曾經費了許多力量，尙未整理好，這是對不起一般居民的。米的來源，尙未完全暢達，也是不十分好的現象。許多商人向我表示，祇要提高價格，什麽都也會源源而來，其實並不如此簡單。依照過去經騐，各種物價，今天加了一分，明天就會再加一分，以至於沒有止境。所以我堅決表示，寗可忍受一時，而絕對要守住「八一九」的限價。我們要知要，只要一個價格的讓步，就會牽涉到全局的。爲了使得物價能够得到長時期的穩定，不得不咬緊牙根，任勞任怨，澈底執行旣定的政策。至於「八一九」價格不十分合理的地方，自然可以調整，使得工業能再生產·但所謂調整，並非漲價，而祇是使整個經濟合　　理，走上正常的軌道。</p>
<p>不讓投機家再做夢</p>
<p>我仔細的觀察，並體念到上海的人民，最近反映着一種不正常的心理，聽說最近一月來上海跳舞廳電影院，以及戲院茶樓酒館的生意，都是空前的熱鬧，到杭州，蘇州，北平去游覽的人，也特別多，一般有錢人的心理，多是度着「今天有酒今天醉，今天有錢今天用」的日子，大家常常說買不到猪肉，但九月份所宰的猪，比八月份的數量要多一萬多隻。據統計，七月十九至八月十八日是七四，三八〇隻，而八月十九至九月十八日是八六，九九一隻，這都是反常心理的反映。我們必須糾正過來，我此刻在這裏講話的時候恐怕也正是許許多多的人正在狂飲跳舞的時候。現在馬路上討飯的男女老幼是多麼痛苦和可憐，在他們當中，恐怕亦有不少的人，亦是從前有錢有身家的豪富，這種對照，運想起中國樂極生悲的古話，是如何値得我們反省和警惕，我很懇切的吿訢大家：今天我們應當多多的顧到國家的困難，同情人民的痛苦，祇有將國家人民的利益，得到保障，才有個人的自由生存。有一部份的上海人，實在應該從醉生夢死的生活中醒過來，從新做人，走上光明的大道。今後上海的市民，有兩條路可走：第一條路，就是保持表面的繁華，有錢的人要什麼就能買到什麼，再讓投機的市塲發達起來，逃避到香港，杭州，蘇州，和莫干山的投機家，重回上海，再來興風作浪，搗亂市塲，使得物價高漲，民不聊生，這是第一條道路。第二條路：就是能够忍耐一時的痛苦，經過一個困難時期，甚至經過一時不景氣現象活。這兩條路，自然祇能走一條，我希望大家能用全力來阻止第一條路，不讓投機家再做投機夢，至於第二條路，祗要大家肯忍受困雞，放棄個人的和一時的利益，那一定是可以走得通的，並且是非走通不可的道路。</p>
<p>最後，我要向大家說明，參加上海區經濟管制工作的人負，我對他們的管束是非常的嚴格，但因爲人數較多，一定有良莠不齊的現象，凡有參加經濟管制工作的幹部，在外招搖撞騙，及敲詐行爲，請各位市民一點也不要留情面的吿訴我，我一定嚴辦。至我自已也是常感覺到難免有許多做錯的地方，所調旁觀者淸，你們一定看得更淸，很懇切的希望大家指出我的錯誤，批評我的缺點，我無不樂於接受。今日我們做事，只有應做卽做，應說卽說，上下一致，同心協力，才能完成這艱鉅的工作。自已感覺十分慚愧，在一個半月的工作中，並未完成本身的任務，今後只有在俞鴻鈞先生領導之下，盡心盡力，從事本位的工作，以報答上海市民的期望。敬祝各位健康！</p>

<h3 id="c105">隆中山畔話襄樊 <a href="#c105" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e105" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">105</a></h3>
<p>— 本報特派記者　凌松壽</p>
<p>〔本報宣昌一日航訊〕襄樊在現在豫鄂邊區烽火正熾的時候，他成爲國軍屛障江漢的一個基石，從今春宛西團隊的實力斷傷以後，在監視陝豫邊境間做着入川之夢的孔匪的行動上，襄樊更有其不可輕估的重要性。事實上，無論「渡江」抑或「入川」，論目前共匪的實力乃至打算，短期內共匪是不願輕易行動去消耗他的實力的。不過客觀環境的演變，果眞共匪要於中原戰塲而外，想另外擴展一個流竄區域的話，襄樊無論如何總是他們的眼中之釘</p>
<p>漢水堤畔　策馬巡視</p>
<p>記者於抵襄之日，曾偕西成駐軍某團龐貴能副團長，策馬於漢水堤旁，視察戰事較激烈之處的襄陽西郊。在襄陽城西四五華里處，有眞武山，獅子山，羊虎山三個山頭，在通常的情况上說，這三個山頭當然是必需加以控制，一則以火力封鎖敵軍進犯路綫，屛障襄陽，一則避免爲敵人佔領，使襄陽城廂受到敵人砲火的威脅，不渦襄樊戰役，匪方並沒有携帶什麼重武器，因此由控制山頭所生的第二個作用，已經失去，而守軍力單勢弱，不能確實保持我軍陣地和山頭守軍間的聯絡綫，以致當城西的天主堂爲敵人佔領，上山的交通綫被截斷後，山上的守軍不得不撤退，由南關轉入城內了。</p>
<p>襄樊自九日陷入重圍後，到十五日被匪突入，這中間有靠近一個星期平靜的日子。在這幾天中，共匪的工作是夤夜挖掘交通壕，由其基地直達襄陽西城，以减少他們的犧牲。記者與龐副團長巡視西郊，灣灣曲曲的交通壕向西伸出，蜿蜓達十數里，這原是一個笨法子，然而共匪却偏偏利用這種笨法子而獲得一些成就。至於在地面上共匪丟下來的璘璘白骨，還有血肉已經被兩個月來風雨剝蝕了的骷髏，觸目皆是，聽秋風吼樹，漢水潮聲，總只能說是戰地上的一種點綴，找不出其他更大的意義。</p>
<p>康澤將軍　生死之謎</p>
<p>襄陽陷匪後，十五綏區司令官康澤將軍的下落該是舉國所關切的事，據鄂五區專負李朗星氏吿訴記者：這在匪佔領綏區的當時，康司令官在地下室曾引槍自殺，彈中左肩，他的衛士忙把槍奪了下來，康李兩氏遂同時被俘。（康氏自殺事，李專負未曾目睹，因被俘時相隔尙遠，這是康司令官的衛兵隨後講出來的）。李氏於被俘後當晚伺隙逃出襄陽，而康司令官被執以後，傳說的消息有三種：（一）說是被俘後因傷勢甚重，不久卽吿殞命。（二）康氏迄仍未死，傷處正由匪方醫治中。（三）康氏被俘後，匪方曾悉心醫治其傷處，但是康氏義不屈膝，拒絕醫治，不進飲食，卒致於河南康河縣殉國。根據匪新華電台的廣播說，康澤已於七月廿八日殉命，以及其他情報，來印證康氏本人的個性，這第三項傳說的可能性很大。（按：據前川陝鄂邊區綏署政工處范龍驤處長談，上項情報業已證實）。國傷大將，對政府以及全國關切康氏的人們，自然是一個無可彌補的遺憾和損失，然而襄樊畢竟光復，只要此後康將軍殉難之地——襄樊，永遠成爲戡亂的堅强堡壘，從而屛障江漢和巴蜀的腹心之地，則康將軍的犧牲，不能說沒有代價的了。</p>
<p>綏區舊址　彈痕處處</p>
<p>記者抵襄後，和駐襄某部政工處的王善誠秘書於夕陽影中，赴十五綏區舊址看了一下，危墻上彈痕處處，這都是共匪給國家民族刻劃下來的傷痕之象徵。地下室卽康司令官自殺未遂之處，刻已成爲一個瓦礫堆。王秘書吿訴記者，襄樊戰事結束後，我軍有十餘人携機槍一挺，潛伏於地下室內，有一天共匪準備向地下室中搜索，他們便大開其機槍，共匪死傷很多，幷且互相傳說有鬼，這足以證明共匪士兵今日之士氣，這十多個人，在地下室中安如泰山，靠着少數乾糧拖命，直到光復後才轉到後方。</p>
<p>記者曾就襄樊今後的防務問題，和駐軍某師伍重巖副師長和任敬修參謀長閒談，他們認爲襄樊之失守，一半是外在的條件不足，一半是也是人事上有未盡之處，以襄樊地勢之好，他們對這裏的防務有莫大的信心。他們兩位都是戰地名將，任氏於豫南確山之役，伍氏於魯南滕縣之役，都曾有輝煌的戰功，在去夏苦守滕縣中，伍氏發明了以汽車燈代替照明彈的辦法，使共匪夜間的活動大受威脅，陳誠總長任內，曾通令全國部隊，效法使用。</p>
<p>襄樊外圍　平靜無事</p>
<p>襄樊外國，目前相當平靜。樊城以北，二三十華里外，不時有小規模的斥堠戰，共匪的實力有限，不敢輕動。在西面，這裏的第X兵團的勁旅，正以南漳爲核心，分三路在山區掃蕩，襄沙路在軍方維護下，車運暢通，襄樊外圍的防務，若論萬無一失，常然能以攻克老河口和新野兩地‘成犄角之勢，以屛陣襄樊爲上策，不過限於兵力，一時還難談到，當然，以楊幹才司令官過去的滕縣，方城，確山三次對共匪大規模的喋血而獲致勝利的成功之經騐與威望，襄樊的安全是無可顧慮的。楊將軍日來公務之暇，時常垂釣於漢水之濱，這種閒情逸緻，可以襯托出鄂北局而的謐靜。隆中山色，漢水揚波，預料鄂北局面，定將隨剛起的秋風，而令人一新耳目。</p>
<h3 id="c106">希臘邊亂之國際背景　（上） <a href="#c106" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e106" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">106</a></h3>
<p>— 太報駐歐特約記者　辛風</p>
<p>此次聯合國第三屆大會議事日程，希臘問題，列爲要案之一。緣此案尙自一九四六年十二月，希政府向安全理事會提出控訴而起。希臘以爲其北邊匪亂，全由其北鄰阿爾巴尼亞，南斯拉夫，保加利亞三國，以軍事接濟所掀起。惟三國認爲變亂之由，在於希政府本身之政治不良，與三國無涉。安全理事會討論結果，派遣一希臘邊境事件調查委員會，由組成安全理事會之十一國担任，前往關係四國，實地調查。中國正代表爲金大使問泗，副代表爲薛公使光前。歷時半載，製成報吿。多數意見，認爲希北邊境，確由三國予以支持。建議安全理事會應令三國停止援助希匪作亂，並主張所有涉及四國之爭論，應由和平辦法解決。安全理事會討論二月，因蘇聯使用否決權，毫無結果。因提交去年九月在紐約舉行之聯合國第二屆大會討論。大會於去年十月二十一日通過建議案，組織聯合國巴爾幹特別委員會。一面由各國派潰巡查員，在希北邊境，常川巡查，三國是否繼續以軍事援助接濟希匪作亂。一面對睦鄰關係，邊境協定，難民回鄉，自由交換少數民族等問題，儘力設法調停疏解，俾緩和三國與希臘之緊張關係，减除其根本之磨擦原因。該會原定由中·美·英，法·蘇·巴西·墨西哥·荷蘭·澳大利亞，巴基斯坦·波蘭等十一國組織。惟蘇聯·波蘭二國，始終拒絕參加。故事實上祗有九國組成。美代表爲駐比太使柯克海軍上將，英代表爲前駐華大使薛穆爵士，墨代表爲前外長加斯丁羅，荷代表爲前海長載葆咸，均一時人物。中國正代表爲薛公使光前，副代表爲趙俊欣。薜公使駐節歐洲有年，且曾參加希臘調查，駕輕就熟，游刃有餘。總部於去年十一月成立設在希北之薩羅尼加，惟最近開會地點，則移在希京雅典。各國共派邊境巡查員四十人，以英美居多數。中國派三人參加。爲桂宗堯。季志仁·楊鳳歧。分駐希阿·希南，希</p>
<p>保三國邊境。日處槍林彈雨之中，出死入生，艱險萬狀。某次桂宗堯出巡希保邊境，遇地雷爆炸，死者十餘人。桂君差之間髮，僅以身免。最近又在希阿邊境，受彈片擊傷，聞希政府爲此特令其駐華大使，向貴外部表示慰問。美國務卿馬歇爾，亦專電吾薛代表光前，深致慰意。上周安志仁乘專機出巡，卽遭希匪以機槍掃射，中彈十餘枚。勉强降落，幸未肇事。今春希匪於半夜偸襲薩羅尼加時，曾向城內放射溜彈砲九十餘發，歷時二小時之久。其中一枚，卽落於薛代表臥室之外，不過二碼之處。當時門窗俱毀，危險可知。世言巴勒斯坦，莫不談虎色變。殊不知巴爾幹艱危之情，禍亂之深，實不在猶太聖城之下也。該會成立迄今，已及十月。除根據巡查結果，加强證實三國之繼續接濟希匪外，對調停疏解工作，因三國拒絕與該會合作，毫無進展。該會於六月三十日先行製成總報吿書，旋又於九月十日，製成補充報吿書，臚陳事實，列具結論及建議，提由此次大會討論。世人皆知希臘問題，並不限於希臘與三國之糾紛。根本癥結，尙在英美與蘇聯之間。如英美與蘇聯不能成立諒解，則此次大會討論，恐亦難有結果。希政府擬請大會派遣國際武力，封鎖其北部長約千餘公里之邊境。惟依據聯合國憲章第四十三條應置於安全理事會之下之國際武力，因蘇聯與中英美法意見對峙，陷於僵局，迄未實現。故希政府之願望，亦不過畫餅充飢而已。茲將希臘邊境之國際背眾，分述如下，以供參考。</p>
<p>希北邊境之地理形勢</p>
<p>希臘與其北隣阿爾巴尼亞，南斯拉夫·保加利亞三國之關係，在未明其地理形勢之前，欲加硏究，殆不可能。希北邊境，從阿爾巴尼亞經南斯拉夫及保加利亞綿長約八百四十英里。一般而言，其邊境區域，除希保邊境之東段外，均爲叢山地帶。希臘在地理上係巴爾幹半島之一角，同時又爲地中海內之一塊陸地。巴爾幹地勢崎　，崗嶺起伏。在希臘與北鄰三國交境地區，無數山谷，橫隔其中。其間祗有幾處，可通公路。從阿爾巴尼亞至希臘，並無大路可通，祗有一條公路從阿國通至巴爾幹半島之中心，最後通至薩羅尼加Salonika及伊斯登Istanbul。此外在阿希邊境之薩倫土巴羅Sarantoporos等處，尙有幾處通道。希臘與南斯拉夫之邊境，則有一條國際通道，從貝爾格萊特Belgrade之南部經尼許Nish及斯谷比Skoplje，延麻拉乏Morava及乏爾達Vardar河流，經傑傑里Gevgeli而達於薩羅尼加。其餘在希南邊境之次要通口，則以卑爾Beles區域之若干路綫較爲主要。希臘與保加利亞邊境之主要通道，則從索非亞Sofia南向通過希境可達土耳其之阿特立亞諾撥爾Adrianople。此外亦有幾處次要通道。歷史上希臘每遭自南北及東西而來之敵人進犯，蓋希臘地勢所處半陸半海，不但在陸地上承危於北，且以人民必須依海爲生，亦時遭海上之襲擊。</p>
<p>數世紀來，希北邊境之地理位置，雖無變動，但其形勢之重要性，已隨時代而改觀。尤其在第二次大戰以後（一九四七至一九四八年期間）蘇聯與英美勢力對峙之結果，希臘首當其衝，因與北鄰三國關係，日趨複雜，目前希北邊境之情形，可於下述希政府於去年十二月八日提送聯合國巴爾幹特別委員會之備忘錄內，得一梗槪：</p>
<p>「希臘與阿爾巴尼亞·保加利亞及南斯拉夫之邊境，現已全部廢棄。一年半以來，希邊防時被襲擊，無數守防士兵，橫遭殺俘。</p>

<p>— 本報特約記者　俞寗頗</p>
<p>〔本報徽州三日訊〕在江南一帶正發生着，鷄和鷄蛋的恐慌之際，讓記者來報道皖南的鹽水鴨，或亦爲讀者所樂聞，鹽水鴨，一名鹹鴨，向爲南京的名產，其次就要數皖南蕪湖了。其實南京鹹鴨的來源，除一部採自高淳，六合外，大部都是購自蕪湖·宣城·合肥等處。蕪湖因擁有靑弋江和巢湖流械，鴨產特富。在民十七八年間，每年毛鴨出產，總在四百萬隻以上。蕪市鹹鴨銷路，每年在百餘萬隻左右。民十九年以後，南京和蕪湖，雖然是市面並不景氣，但鹹鴨的消費，每年仍能保持着原有銷路的一大部份，堅挺不衰。</p>
<p>產銷</p>
<p>毛鴨的產地頗廣，有家鴨和野鴨兩種的分別：家鴨是農家自已孵養的，野鴨是產於江湖葦洲一帶。蘇省的高淳·六合·高郵各地，都盛產毛鴨，農家飼養亦夥。皖南蕪湖·宣城·當塗·大通·貴池·及合肥等地農家養鴨，還比蘇省更多。南部的靑弋江和中部的巢湖及大通的和悅洲，野鴨的生產尤富。每年秋天九月裏起，至翌年正月這五個中，正値肥鴨上市的時候，京蕪鴨店客商到這時，都到產區向鴨販收買，因爲直接交易，價錢比較公道。</p>
<p>皖南和皖中毛鴨的產量，年在三四百萬隻。南京鴨舖，全市有一百多家，大半都是天方敎中人所開設的，每年銷數，自二百萬至一百五六十萬隻。蕪市鴨的銷路比南京較遜，因爲首都人口較盛，來往旅客亦較繁，鹹鴨的銷塲，將來還是有把握的。</p>
<p>製作</p>
<p>鹹鴨製作，多取肥大的生鴨，病死的鴨子，是剔去不用的。醃鴨鹽滷，愈陳愈好，這鹽滷就是用鹽熬成的精汁，鮮滷熬汁的鴨味是要較差一點。</p>
<p>製法是將宰殺的鴨，退去大毛和細毛，在翅下部，剖開一個小洞，把內臟取出，洗凈鴨腹內部，不令有血液滯留在內，再用鹽塞進腹部，並塗抹週身。每鴨須用鹽四兩，約經過廿四小時後，這時鹽水變成血水，又把腹內的鹽水，傾倒乾凈，浸入老滷裏，約經十二小時，取出掛在鈞上，待風將潮濕吹乾，就成鹹鴨的名產了。</p>
<p>製作鹹鴨的時期，以在秋後春前這幾個月裘爲最適宜，春暖以後，各鴨舖都停止製作，如遇需要時，也有從事製作的，手續還是一樣，不過醃在老滷裏，時間上要縮短一些，因爲天氣溫暖，鹹味容易浸受，大約春秋兩季，醃的時間，要十二小時，至夏季，祗須三小時就够了。</p>
<p>煮法</p>
<p>鹹鴨是江南的名產，所以客居在京蕪兩地的人，或是過路的旅客，回到家鄕去的時候，總要購員鹹鴨幾隻，去餽贈親友。江輪靠近京蕪碼頭時，呌賣鹹鴨的小阪，一羣蜂湧的跑到船上來兜售，輪船上的旅客們，對此珍饈，也要買一隻或二隻，用以加餐下酒。</p>
<p>鹹鴨的煮法，如果烹製不得其法，食時自然有不合口味的嫌。最好的烹製法，是要將水煮沸之後，拿鴨放入，這時卽須摻以淨水二成，用鍋蓋蓋上，最好是用小蓋，使鴨不致浮於水面，同時將灶火熄滅，約五十分鐘或一小時後，再將鍋內的水，連鴨煮沸至八成的模樣，（發現小泡爲止），將鴨取起，傾出腹內的積水，重放鍋內，並和凉水少許，文火煮之，約歷一小時，取食，那味自然是鮮美無比了。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕督導員辦公處以增加生產爲當務之急，故對本市原料存量特別注重調查。現悉工業曾對十五種主要原料之需要量，巳列就詳表送交督導員辦公處物資調節委員會，以供參考。據辦公處表示：各項工樂原料之中，柴油汽油之存量可供四個月之用。棉花一項，美援棉花巳大量運到，且巳開始分配，兩三個月內可無匱乏之虞，原棉旣有供應，棉紗自無問題。燒碱凈碱兩項，永利公司及合灣方面均可充份供應。智利硝一項，央行過去有大量存儲，可儘址供給市面需求，染料之供需情形，則據染布業公會之估計，每月需要量爲四十五萬磅，中信局現有儲量爲一百八十萬磅，足敷四月之用。明礬一項，進口限額中因預有規定，來源無缺。此外如廠鐵等原料，輪船公司平時有大量賣出，已可應付市面需要。故事實上原料問題，並不如意想中之嚴重。</p>
<h3 id="c110">棉紗市場停頓後　紗商擬辦聯合配銷 <a href="#c110" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e110" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">110</a></h3>
<p>棉紗商業同業公會理事畏唐志良，昨謁蔣督導員，請求提早核定紗商營業範圍，並提供成立棉紗聯合配銷處意見，其所持理由三點如次：</p>
<p>（一）棉紗市塲交易停止後，全體會員紗號中，僅零售商尙擬有存貨，可資營業，但存貨售完，亦將與同樣停頓。彼等今從營業範團，應請早日核定，以維生存。</p>
<p>（二）棉紗批發商，推銷紗廠成品，遠至南洋近東各地，爲應付各城鄉手工業需要起見，擬請將紗廠成品，除直接配銷本街複製業外，擬由全體紗商，組織聯合配銷處，分本街零售商與國內外遝銷商二組，核定其業務範圍。至如何分配，俟原則決定後，再另擬詳細辦法呈請核奪。此項辦法如屬可行，則市塲停止後，紗商可有固定業務，而本外埠各地，棉紗之需供，亦可趨入正常。</p>
<p>（三）紗業直接簡接從業人員，達數萬人，如不使紗商業務繼續維持，則增加失業人員，影響社會。</p>
<p>生產估計</p>
<p>頃據物資調節委員會方面獲恣：關於本市紗布外運，自經日前會議中決定，根據實際產量及消費量作有計劃之外銷後，此項生產，消費數量，業經初步估計完竣。計本市各廠，每月產量，總額約在九萬件以上，除供應本市每月約五萬件之需要，所餘四萬件中，將以二萬件運銷國外，易取原棉，二萬件運銷內地。</p>
<p>據該會副主委李立俠氏昨晨吿記者，目前紗布供應，絕無恐慌之虞，蓋全國各廠開工紗錠，約在四頁萬錠以上，較之戰前僅减少百分之二十左右，而一般人民之購買力，則較戰前降低百分之二十以上。至於原棉供應，問題當局亦正竭力設法中，預計今後全國所需原棉，頁分之六十，可呈由國內供應，其餘百分之四十，則向國外易取云。</p>
<p>中紡配紗</p>
<p>本市棉紗棉布二市場繼續停業，昨紡建公司循例開紗計有八種，內四十支TK日光牌紗，限內衣業申購，四十及六十支日光，限手帕業，十支雙股限帆布業，十六支粗紗限毛巾業請購。至二十支紗因中央銀行及行總配貨均未交來，暫停配售。</p>
<p>又訊：金管當局爲管制物資，紗布二市塲，均已停集，致外埠各複製廠商，無處購辦原料，日前曾向紡建公司申購，欲與本市各廠商同樣享受配售請購權利，現已圓滿解決，准於下期一併配售。</p>
<p>棉布市塲繼續停業，布業公會仍代表染織業公會，辦理第二期配布，計配出雜色布二萬五千餘疋，凡該會會員門售布店均可請購。又代民營染廠供售布疋四萬餘疋，限會員申購。</p>
<p>近日市上搶購之風盛行，飛綸線團則仍盡量供應，聞其在南洋·印度各地銷售所得之外匯，與紡建交換棉紗，製線原料乃不缺乏云。</p>

<p>棉布業公會，頃以市民對於棉布搶風日熾，尤以棉布業爲最，一般棉布門市部，皆相繼提早打烊，致市面頓現恐慌，影響人心尤大。昨特通知各會員，以國家民族爲重，愼重從事，並規定時間，一體遵守。（一）禮拜一至六，自上午九時至下午六時，（二）禮拜日自上午十時至下午五時止。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕國營事業股票，昨日共售出金圓一萬八千五百圓，運前合計爲四百零三萬七千四百圓。各類股票售出額如次：紡建二百八十六萬一千圓，招商四萬五千五百圓，台糖一百零三萬五千二百圓，合紙九萬一千七百圓，津紙四千圓。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕銀錢業一片增炎聲中，微聞財政當局對保險業之增資事宜，亦在積極草擬辦法，且有規定該業增炎至每家最低資本額爲二十萬元之談。記者昨曾向金管局林局長探詢財部對該業增資之處理辦法，林局長答稱：關於保險業之增炎辦法，迄朱奉到部令，猶待核示中。</p>
<p>惟據此間保險界領袖人士見解：保險業增資事宜與銀錢業顯有不同。財政當局對保險業之管理，似應着眼於該業保費之自留額及分保額兩項業務，而資本額之大小，實屬次要問題。</p>
<p>據吿：保險界之意見，每家最低之資本額，以增資至十萬元較屬確當。如果最低資本額規定太高，使投資於保險業之减少，進而减少保險同業，致使僅剩之少數保險業，無法承受鉅額之保額，而大批向外分保時，豈非徒損國家外匯。故渠認爲，財政當局正可利用此一增資之機會，擬定一切實合宜之增資額，同時對同業之自留額分保額愼加注意，當更易促進我國保險業之發展云。</p>
<h3 id="c115">法幣作造紙原料 <a href="#c115" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e115" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">115</a></h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕自金圓券發行以來，收進之老法幣為數甚多，估計在一百萬億以上。央行國庫憶對此筆法幣之處理，已有所決定。即凡收兌區域設有造幣工廠者，一律由各造紙廠購買，作為造紙原料。如其紙廠距離過遠，紙廠所出之承購價格，尚不敷過費者，則予以銷燬了事。至本市所收回之巨額法幣，一俟整理完畢，將以標售方式賣與紙廠。</p>
<h3 id="c116">美棉首次分配量　總數約計七萬包 <a href="#c116" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e116" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">116</a></h3>
<p>據美援花紗布聯營處頃發表：美援棉花總量，預定爲三十餘萬包，（每包五百磅）將依其各批到達情形，作爲三次或四次分配完畢，第一次分配數量爲六九·五一八包。</p>
<p>第一次分配之比例標準，依據美援棉花分配原則，應按照國內各紡織廠之開工紗錠數目平均比例分配，第一次之比例，係以全國國民營紗廠現在開工總錠數四，四一九，四五二枚，計每一開工紗錠約可分得美援棉花〇·〇一五七包，（按百分比計算，計國營紗廠佔百分之四〇·〇七，民營紗廠佔百分之五八·二，外商紗廠佔百分之一。</p>
<p>第一次分配美棉，以長度等級別，計分三十一種，受配紗廠約二百卅餘家，折換紗布種類繁多，故在公允審愼防誤之條件下工作，手續相當繁重。</p>
<p>自九月中旬開始工作，截至現在止，計已接受正式申請之紗廠八十七單位，均已簽訂完畢，發給提單。除由天津·青島撥發約一萬包外，據上海各倉庫報吿，一已發川棉花六千餘包，日來正催一促已領提單之廠商提取中。</p>

<h3 id="c145">期待什麼？ <a href="#c145" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e145" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">145</a></h3>
<p>— 吳庸</p>
<p>R·L·伊文思於以「期待」爲題的一篇短文中說過大意如下的話：有許多人是在期待着，期待着的究竟是什麽朱必說得淸楚，可是仍然莫名其妙的在期待着，生命就在期待之中悄然逝去。做父親的滿想等稍有空閑時與兒子更親密些；做母親的眞心想更注意些女兒的事；可是正在等待機會的時候，時不我待，女兒竟然出嫁了，兒子成家立業各自分居了。有些人無時不在想戒除惡習慣，無時不在想與友朋冬有交往的機會。可是什麼時候實行呢？人們似乎忘了日常生活卽是我們的人生。所謂人生，卽指我們所處的這個時代，卽指我們所過的每一天，每一小時。不管我們失望也罷，厭煩也罷，這却是我們的人生。作者末了問；我們是在期待些什麼呢？</p>
<p>我們是在期待些什麽呢？以個人論，甚感惘然。</p>
<p>爲了找該篇短文，於美國雜誌中同時找到了三篇意義類似的文章，足見這種思想在美國之受人重視。筆者讀書不多，然經搜索腦海之結果，發見我國哲學中竟沒有這種思想。莊子是主張冥同人我萬物，固不勸人看重將來，可是同時也呌你不要看重現在；楊朱說過「且趣當生，奚遑死後」的話，表面有點像，可是其眞意是呌你及時消極的作樂享受，不是勸人積極的注重當前的事。古詩：「生年不滿白，常懷千歲憂，」亦偏重於消極。該項思想在儒家中似乎也不曾遇到過，在釋敎中則是更不會有的。其所以沒有的緣故是否因爲太平凡呢？此非我所知。</p>
<p>我們的傳統思想，其重心是高估將來，如「節約」，如「勤儉」，如「瞻前顧後」，如「高瞻遠矚』，都是以將來爲中心。大致美國人之所以勤，其志趣卽在不儉，如志趣在「儉」之一字，又何必勤呢？至於聖經「不要爲明日而祖心，明日的事且讓明日自己去處理」那一類的話，在浸潤於傳統思想的老先生聽來，甚且將目爲邪說亦未可知。然奇怪的是：你越是顧慮「將來」你便越有喪失「今日」的危險。因爲看重在未可知之數的將來的結果，你便失掉了自身的重心，也卽是失掉自己。</p>
<p>一人的生命畢竟是許多個「今日一所結合而成的；一國的侖運畢竟是多數「個人一所形成的。如果全國上下只是期待將來，不顧今日，以這樣失掉了重心的人民所組成的國家，其命運將如何，實是可以不言而喩的。可是事實上我們之中確有許多的人已經喪失了自己的重心。這些人實在都是極端的善良份子。此輩一聽得美貸有望則喜，美貸無望則憂。一聽得某某將出國，則輾轉探詢此訊是否屬實，神色倉惶，一如萬事在此一舉者然；如探得某公此去只是花掉些外匯，則立卽唉聲歎氣，以爲一切的一切都從此完了；及知他去確爲貸款，則頓時又寄以莫大的期望。以本市謠言之多，一人如專注意名公巨卿之將如何如何，則儘可終日不務自己正業，而仍忙得不可開交。實則「事有必至，理有固然」，將來任何眞正重大的事，今日無一不可依據過去測得正確的推論，又何必予以無謂的期待呢？所重要的是今日的你。</p>
<p>如不然者，則自民國以來，先是若干年的「時値非常」，繼之以八年的「抗戰時期」，及今連下來就是「戡亂時期」，一定要等待天下太平的正常時期之蒞臨，我們很可能會頽然老去，而一事無成。何况翻翻歷史，我們知道天下就從未正常過呢。</p>
<p>準此，我們不妨把楊朱的話改變一下，作爲吾人的座右銘：「且管今日，奚遑明天！」</p>

<p>— 樂志</p>
<p>以一個初到上海的人，略述其所得印象如左，不知久住的人所感如何。</p>
<p>上海一般的現象，是複雜，豐富，而紊亂矛盾，到處令人捉摸不住，這是因爲一個都市經歷了一百年的過程，逐步發展所致，有先天的因素，無可如何。南京路的擁擠，就是最顯著之一例。大約上海是專爲最高級生活的人們住的，他們可以超然於一般現實之外，而自得其樂。其次則最低級生活的人，也可以犧牲任何現實的拘束，而苟延生命。普通中級的人最無辦法，他們不能頂房子住，却又不能在馬路旁過夜，一切公共法律的對象是他們，他們要負擔，要遵守，然而爲他們的福利，却大有待於努力。舉一例以言，街市上的公共男女厠所，絕無而僅有，就是有，誰也不知道在什麼地方。這事又很難以開口問人，高級的人坐着汽車，飯店茶座，以及熟識的地方，可以左右逢源，最低級的人也可以不顧一切，但普通人要隨意解決，却又爲禮與法所不許可了。老實講，現在上海這件事並不是小問題，試看稍爲偏僻點的馬路旁的痕迹，不得不謂爲一種汚辱。探原之論，就是公共男女厠所太沒有分配平均，又沒有顯明的指示。其實公厠的構浩不妨力求簡單，而處所不可不大爲增加，須知許多低級人家中連這點便利都沒有，而都仰賴公厠呀。</p>
<p>從前外國人管理租界，是不計中國人便利的，門牌上沒有街名，馬路相隔又太長，往往中途下車，有不知置身何處之感。有幾種一極輕而易舉的事，何妨做一做呢？每路的起迄點，應在路牌上寫明是東口抑西口，南口抑北口，太長的路，應該分段立一脾寫明由某路口至某路口門牌是幾號至幾號，電車站應寫明幾路車在何處等候，公共車輛應在車身漆上所經過的路綫，（上海地形有浦江蘇州河及跑馬廳作標準，只須繪一版間之略圖，象徵經過的地方就行了。）公共車輛各路末班車的時刻不一，也應分別說明。此外郵政車的標識我們是看見了，但是沒有時刻的說明，則情形不熟的人，又如何知道什麼時刻來候這郵車呢？諸如此類，都未免便利而不能澈底。</p>
<p>上海的地名，有了新路口舊路名的迷惑，又加上口頭所說的與紙上所寫的兩種不同，無一不表現其複雜紊亂性，所以指示路綫的設備，似乎還需要增加。</p>

<p>— 陳湘</p>
<p>荷蘭女皇威廉明娜於今年九月初退位了。這位六十七歲的老太君是在一八九八年八月三十一日，她的十八歲的生日，那一天就位的，秉政時期實足有半個世紀，</p>
<p>威廉明娜是奧倫琪王室第十一代的帝君。她的父親威廉三世生她時已是六十三歲的衰年，並且僅祗生她這麽一個繼承大統的人。不過，她的母后艾瑪當時却祗有二十歲，是威廉三世的續弦夫人。威廉三世駕崩時，威廉明娜年僅十歲，由母后攝玫八年後，始正式登基、</p>
<p>威廉明娜爲人樸實勤儉，她住在位於海牙的一條熙攘的街道上的一座簡樸的白色宮殿中。這座皇宮甚至和其他的房屋一樣的也有門牌——六十八號。裏面祗有火爐而無水汀，當女皇想洗澡的時候，水還得臨時一桶一桶的去挑來。她出外也和平民一樣的騎脚踏車，車子平時就停放在宮門附近的一隻架子上。她抽空還操營家務，在二次大戰以前，人們常能看見她坐在窗口縫紉。</p>
<p>新接位的裘麗安娜公主是女皇與馬克蘭堡的亨利王子的唯一的結晶品，生於一九〇九年，算起來如今已是一個三十八歲的中年婦女了。女皇鑑於自己童年時代所過的生活太受約束，慘澹而少生氣，所以她用一種更正常的方式敎養裘麗安娜。她允許她到宮外的學校去求學，和其他的孩子在一起玩要，因此，裘麗安娜有許多朋友，並且毫無拘束的自由的與平民混在一起。來，這位荷蘭新君不但濡染到她的母親的僕實的作風，並且將更形接近平民、</p>
<p>現屆學期開始，適値幣制改革，滿擬如約往取，勉敷學雜等費。不料該行仍以戰前一般存款償付辦法爲詞，僅允一次結淸，付款二角有餘。試問十二年前存入白米卅石之代價，今日祗付自米一升，不足以購一書之用，天下寗有此理。査政府倡導怖約，獎</p>

<p>— 張汝賢</p>
<p>美國名作家馬克吐溫，可算最勤於寫情書的人了。他和李維女士結婚之後來鴻去簡，仍未嘗稍間。當他出門客居他鄕的時候，幾乎每日要寄她一封信，有時一天内寄了四封。卽使當他在家的時候，還是要寫信給她，常把短簡便箋，放在她的早餐盤子裏，有時則塞在她的手裏。下面一通是在一八八五年十一月二十七日寫的，那天是李維女士四十歲誕辰，同時又是他們二人結婚十七週紀念。他以早晨來喩靑春時代，以翠谷綠野來喩靑春時代快樂的日子。你看，簡直是一首美麗的詩：</p>
<p>「親愛的，這裏我們到了另一個紀程碑，離開我們出發的地方已很遙遠了。但我們回首後顧，一片宜人景色—在我們愉快的回憶中，那遙遠的早晨的一切，猶是依舊，坡谷依然蒼翠欲滴，平野依然繁花如錦，層巒依然寂寞無言。在這旅途上我們還有許多伙伴在一起—啊，如此可珍的，可愛的，溫雅的，足以激我志氣的伙伴！他們使我們忘却旅途之困頓。你和我都朝向落日前進，他們伴着我們，拉着我們的手，使我們的脚不覺疲乏。大家在一塊兒，只是日益親愛。大家走向前面的叢花綠野，薄暮的光在原野和繁花後面閃耀着，和昔日那個柔美的早晨一般的可愛。」</p>

<h3 id="e5">Decision to Increase Dividends on State-Owned Enterprise Stocks <a href="#e5" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c5" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">5</a></h3>
<p>To Encourage People to Purchase Enthusiastically</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 6th] The Ministry of Industry and Commerce convened a meeting on the afternoon of the 6th, inviting the Ministry of Transportation, the Resources Commission, and other agencies to discuss how to make the sale of state-owned enterprise stocks smoother and improve the technology for selling them. Deng Hanliang, Director of the Department of Commerce, and Fei Mingyang, Director of the Department of Control, both attended. As a result of the exchange of opinions, it was decided that in order to make people more enthusiastic about purchasing state-owned enterprise stocks, dividends should be increased and the priority rights of private shares should be determined. The dividend for China Textile Industries Corporation (CTIC) was previously set at 5% per share for government shares and 1% per share for private shares. In the future, the dividend for private shares will be further increased according to the original standard. At the same time, it is hoped that the Ministry of Transportation and the Resources Commission will do the same for the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company (CMSNC), Taiwan Sugar Corporation (TSC), and Taiwan Paper Corporation (TPC). Regarding the determination of the priority rights of private shares, various methods will be adopted, such as the priority dividend rights of private shares and increasing the management rights of private shares, so that private shareholders can participate more in the board of directors and supervisors. In addition, opinions were exchanged on the issue of guaranteed interest, and it was generally believed that the government should still provide interest to private shareholders when the company does not make money and there are no dividends to distribute. The various points decided at the meeting will be made into suggestions by the Ministry of Industry and Commerce next week after the Ministry of Transportation and the Resources Commission submit written opinions, and will be sent to the government for adoption in order to facilitate the sale of state-owned enterprise stocks, but the basic methods and principles of the sale will not be changed.</p>

<p>Congressman Judd Speaks in Los Angeles</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, San Francisco, 4th] Republican Congressman Judd spoke to 6,000 teachers from city and county schools in Los Angeles on the 2nd of this month, with the following main points: Assisting China is the main opportunity for the United States to avoid war with the Soviet Union. China is the key to Asia. It is very easy for us to make a big mistake in China again. At least we can use the situation in Berlin, where the US Air Force is restricted, as a lesson. If the Soviet Union controls China, then all Southeast Asian countries will also be under its control, and then it will inevitably extend to the Philippines. Judd said at the end that he had discussed this point with MacArthur a month ago, and he found that MacArthur was quite troubled by the situation in China.</p>

<h3 id="e22">Various Committees of the Legislative Yuan Promote Work Separately; Draft Amendments to the Principles of Confidential Meetings of the Yuan <a href="#e22" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c22" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">22</a></h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 6th] The various committees of the Legislative Yuan discussed and promoted their work separately on the 6th. In the morning, the Foreign Affairs Committee discussed the standards for treaty cases and cases concerning the Sino-US Commercial Treaty Protocol, etc. The National Defense Committee secretly discussed the National Defense Department Organization Act. The Economic Affairs Committee and the Finance Committee each held a convener's meeting to discuss the agenda. The Budget Committee secretly discussed the review procedure for the general budget and passed it with amendments. The Labor Committee reviewed the Trade Union Law draft. The Commercial Law Committee discussed the rules of procedure and the opinion letter from the Electrical Engineering Association regarding the Electricity Law and the opinion letter from the Banking Association forwarding the opinions of the China Industrial Bank on the Banking Law, etc. In the afternoon, the Legal Affairs Committee amended and passed the "Draft Principles for Confidential Meetings of the Legislative Yuan." The Social Affairs Committee reviewed the draft amendments to the Farmers' Association Law.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 6th] The Foreign Affairs Committee of the Legislative Yuan held a meeting on the morning of the 6th to process the cases submitted by the Yuan for review. More than 30 members attended, chaired by Cheng Tianfang. First, they discussed the "Executive Yuan's consultation on the US Senate's resolution on the Sino-US Commercial Treaty Protocol, requesting review to facilitate compliance." This case was because the US Senate, when approving the Sino-US Commercial Treaty Protocol, reserved the US government's rejection of Article 5(c) of the Protocol regarding the protection of translations of literary and artistic works, and that the relevant provisions of the 1903 Sino-US Supplementary Treaty of Commerce and Navigation should still apply to this issue before the two countries negotiate a protection agreement. The US Embassy then consulted our side for their opinion. The Executive Yuan considered this reservation to be a formal change to the treaty and first consulted the Yuan for review. After the Yuan submitted it to the Foreign Affairs Committee for review, the members expressed their opinions on this case and decided to invite representatives from relevant government departments to attend and explain, and to ask academic circles and groups to provide opinions before further discussion. The second case was: "Executive Yuan's consultation on four temporary specific standards regarding treaties, requesting review." Li Baohong, a specialist of the Foreign Affairs Committee, presented his research opinion on this issue, arguing that the scope of "treaties" should be expanded to include all kinds of international diplomatic documents with important content, which is very different from what the Ministry of Foreign Affairs submitted to the Executive Yuan for consultation to the Legislative Yuan. Some members believed that all international diplomatic measures, such as the Foreign Minister's attendance at the UN General Assembly on behalf of the government, should also be approved by the Legislative Yuan, and that the review by the Legislative Yuan should not be circumvented by distinguishing between "treaties" and "executive agreements." However, most members believed that this issue was worth discussing and that it involved the interpretation of constitutional provisions, and that it should be decided by the Council of Grand Justices. After much debate, no result was reached, and it was decided to continue the discussion at the next meeting. Finally, the candidates for members of the Financial Committee to jointly conduct a preliminary review of the proposal by Zhang Qingzhen and others that "the Executive Yuan should be urged to formulate and implement specific measures as soon as possible for the registration, management, and administration of foreign exchange assets of Chinese citizens deposited abroad, so as to be effective" were nominated, and the meeting adjourned at around 12:00 noon.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 6th] The Budget Committee of the Legislative Yuan held a meeting at 9:00 a.m. on the 6th, chaired by Li Hanming, to discuss the review procedure for the general budget. As a result, according to the opinion of the general meeting, Articles 7 and 9 were amended, and it was decided to submit a report to the Yuan meeting on the 8th. If approved, the review will proceed according to the procedure. Premier Weng, Minister Wang, and Director Xu of the Directorate-General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics will be invited to the Yuan next Tuesday to report.</p>

<h3 id="e29">Editorial: How to Ensure the Success of Economic Controls? <a href="#e29" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c29" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">29</a></h3>
<p>—Dedicated to the First Economic Control Conference of the Shanghai Area—</p>
<p>Following the expansion of the Shanghai Economic Control Zone, the first economic control conference of the two municipalities and three provinces of Nanjing, Shanghai, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui is being held in the capital today. In addition to discussing the control of materials and the rationing of daily necessities, the conference will also review the connection between economic controls in the two municipalities and three provinces. The mayors of the two municipalities and the chairmen of the three provinces will personally participate in the discussions, demonstrating the importance of this economic conference. Especially today, when panic buying has occurred in various cities and Shanghai is about to become an economic island, we naturally attach particular importance to the first economic control conference held by the two municipalities and three provinces.</p>
<p>Everyone recognizes that the success or failure of our country's current currency reform is not only a matter of life and death for the 450 million people across the country, but also a key to the honor, disgrace, rise, and fall of the nation. Therefore, both the government and the public hold the expectation of "only success, no failure" for this currency reform. However, the success of currency reform depends half on the economic control methods after the currency reform, and even more on the soundness of the reform plan itself. Of course, the government officials will insist that the plan itself is bold and powerful, thorough and appropriate, and that success or failure depends on the people's belief and support. And among the general public, it can be said that they wholeheartedly supported it in the first month, especially the citizens of Shanghai. But scholars and experts are worried about how to remedy some of the loopholes in the plan itself. Naturally, the government will use control methods to remedy this. Therefore, the authorities have attached particular importance to strengthening economic control from beginning to end. In addition to establishing an Economic Control Commission under the Executive Yuan, economic control supervisors were also established in the four major cities of Shanghai, Guangzhou, Tianjin, and Chongqing to be stationed in various places to promote various measures to stabilize the economy; particular emphasis was placed on the economic control of the Shanghai area, and Yu Hongjun and Jiang Jingguo were sent to Shanghai as supervisors. Of course, everyone believes that Shanghai is the center of industry and commerce in the country, the source of speculation and hoarding, and that every time prices soared in the past, the rising winds always blew from Shanghai to various places. As long as the economic control of the Shanghai area is done well, prices in various places will naturally follow Shanghai's lead. Although some people with broader vision pointed out that economic matters may not be so simple, Shanghai can affect the interior, and the interior can also strike Shanghai. However, the speakers spoke earnestly, but the listeners were dismissive. But what is the reality after a month and a half? Now it is clear to all.</p>
<p>Under the iron fist of Supervisor Jiang in the Shanghai area, eliminating the black market, eradicating speculation, banning hoarding, regulating the supply of materials, and guarding the "August 19" price limit defense line, it cannot be denied that the economic control in the Shanghai area has initially achieved great success. But if we look at the prices in Chongqing, Nanjing, Guangzhou, Beijing, and Tianjin, in the month and a half after the currency reform, they have all risen by one to three times. Although the calls to "follow Shanghai's lead" and "learn from Jiang Jingguo" can be heard almost everywhere, have they really followed? We sincerely admire Supervisor Jiang's work in controlling the economy, but at the same time, we are very worried for him. The temporary stabilization of prices in Shanghai for more than forty days, although it has not completely rescued the citizens of Shanghai from the depths of misery, has at least given the people oppressed by high prices a chance to breathe. Moreover, Jiang's hard-working, fast-paced, and pragmatic attitude and his enthusiasm for serving the people not only refreshed the ears and eyes of the whole country, but also established a new style of politics, which can have a great effect in winning people's hearts. In today's "people's hearts yearning for change," Jiang Jingguo's performance in Shanghai can be seen not only as the starting point of a "new deal," but also as a beacon of hope for the people of the whole country. This is why we admire him so much; however, this is also why we are so worried.</p>
<p>Why worry? There are three reasons:</p>
<p>First, the economic power of the Shanghai area is not enough. Supervisor Jiang is facing thorny roads in promoting his economic control work in Shanghai. Many enemies are lurking around him, and they are intentionally and unintentionally trying to break through this "August 19" defense line at all times, giving the impression that "the Tao is one foot high, but the demon is ten feet high." Therefore, although Shanghai's prices are still guarding the first line of defense of "August 19," it is undeniable that Shanghai has become an economically isolated island! At present, the economic isolation of Shanghai from other regions, the depression of the business community, and the reduction of work in various factories have caused production to show signs of contraction. At the same time, the oversupply of floating capital has made the "August 19" defense line precarious. Furthermore, due to the resurgence of the citizens' psychology of "valuing goods over money," a panic buying wave has also occurred in Shanghai. If this bad situation is allowed to evolve naturally, not only will the prices in various places not follow Shanghai's lead, but Shanghai may be forced to follow the prices in various places. Originally, economic affairs are like a ring without end, closely related to each other, and decisions are interdependent. There is no possibility of "throwing a whip to stop the flow." Supervisor Jiang's economic control work in the Shanghai area can at most be expanded to the two municipalities and three provinces. Regardless of how the two municipalities and three provinces carry out their economic control work and keep pace, even if they do as well as Shanghai in the past month and a half, what about the areas outside the two municipalities and three provinces? Therefore, the success of economic control in the Shanghai area cannot rely on the strength of the Shanghai area alone, nor can it rely solely on the strength of several members of the Suppression and Construction Brigade, let alone rely solely on the strength of Supervisor Jiang alone, but depends on how closely the overall economic control work across the country is coordinated and how to strengthen its strength.</p>
<p>Second, the government has not yet had any real manifestation of encouraging increased production, but wants to rely on an iron fist to permanently maintain the price limit, which is too difficult for Supervisor Jiang. Strictly enforcing price limits is like using an ice pack for a feverish patient, taking sleeping pills for an insomnia patient, or giving a cardiac tonic to a patient with heart failure. This is only a temporary measure to treat the symptoms, and the source of the disease cannot be cured by relying solely on these drugs. But in the past month and a half, in addition to asking doctors to use these methods for treatment, what efforts has the government made to help increase agricultural products and factory-made products? On the contrary, it only wants to use the method of rigid price limits to suppress the prices of agricultural products, and to use rigid restrictions to block the source of raw materials for factories and to cut off the way for factory-made products, making an industrial city and the rural areas of the interior economically disjointed. How can this increase production? If production does not increase, but consumption is unlimited, we are very worried about the future of economic control work in the Shanghai area.</p>
<p>Third, the central government officials have not only failed to balance the national treasury's revenue and expenditure and do not have the courage to implement methods to maintain the value of the gold yuan currency, but instead constantly issue indiscriminate remarks and stimulate the people's trust in the gold yuan. It must be known that the focus of the economic reform plan is not only on reforming the currency system, but also on balancing the national budget. Otherwise, if the legal tender is exchanged for the gold yuan, and the government still relies on issuing currency, what will be the result? The total amount of gold yuan is 2 billion yuan, and more than 900 million yuan have been issued by the end of September. How does the government plan to recover the large amount of gold yuan, or issue less gold yuan in the future? Selling shares of state-owned enterprises without selling them individually according to each unit, but selling them in a general way, what effect can it achieve? If the sale of shares is changed, but the stock exchange is not allowed to open, what will happen if people who buy shares have an urgent need? The people have handed in a large amount of gold, silver, and foreign currency in exchange for gold yuan, but the government has not yet issued hard subsidiary coins to gain trust. It also does not have the courage to dare to transfer the large amount of gold, silver, and foreign currency that it has collected, as well as the gold, silver, and foreign exchange that the government has already controlled, to a foreign exchange fund so that the people can exchange gold yuan for foreign exchange from the Central Bank when they have legitimate needs, such as preparing production raw materials, machinery, and daily necessities, to strengthen the people's trust in the value of the gold yuan. How can it be easy to suddenly change the people's abnormal psychology of valuing goods over money? What's more, our Minister of Finance Wang openly told reporters in the United States that we need US aid of 500 million US dollars per year for two or three years to balance revenue and expenditure. If what is reported is true, isn't this openly making fun of the gold yuan currency? There is no courage to rectify tax collection, and there is no courage to adjust the prices of transportation and public utilities, and the national treasury still has to subsidize a large amount. The salaries of public officials and teachers must be increased. If this is the case, when can the national treasury's revenue and expenditure be balanced? If this cannot be done, it is the fundamental cause of all difficulties. But hoping for the success of economic control in the Shanghai area seems too extravagant.</p>
<p>Therefore, we believe that the key to ensuring the success of economic control does not lie in the Shanghai area, but in the central government's decision-making and in the implementation throughout the country!</p>

<p>[Our Hangzhou Dispatch, 6th] Panic buying is still very prevalent in Hangzhou. Shops are greatly alarmed. Mayor Zhou specially convened a conversation with various industries on the morning of the 6th. Various industries put forward requests, the main ones being to open up the source of goods, to require Shanghai manufacturers to have rationing rights, to require legal profits, and to limit the quantity of goods purchased. The municipal government accepted and forwarded them to Jiang Jingguo, and decided to limit the quantity purchased. Shops must still maintain eleven hours of business.</p>
<p>[Our Suzhou Dispatch, 6th] The market in Suzhou is becoming increasingly bleak today. Shops are decorating their windows with a small amount of inferior goods, barely coping with retail sales. Cigarettes have been out of stock for three days. Edible oil must be purchased from oil shops outside the city to obtain a small amount. Rice shops are using low-quality reddish-brown unpolished rice mixed with grains and chaff to supply the market. Ordinary people are complaining loudly.</p>
<p>[Our Wuxi Dispatch, 6th] The market price of coarse grains in Wuxi is lower than that in Suzhou and Shanghai. Few merchants transport goods to Wuxi. The market is sluggish. Very little japonica rice is arriving. There is slightly more indica rice. There is a price for white japonica rice, but no goods. Mostly inferior goods are used to supply the market. People are competing to buy flour. Restaurants are mostly not using chicken in banquets because the price of chicken exceeds the price limit by one time.</p>
<p>[Our Zhenjiang Dispatch, 6th] Recently, the local silk and cloth have been purchased competitively by ordinary citizens due to the ban on exports from the production areas of Wuxi and Shanghai. Sales have increased sharply, reaching a state of panic buying. In order to prevent the smuggling of materials to bandit areas, the guild has specially requested the government authorities to impose restrictions and require purchases to be made with a national identity card.

After the cotton cloth and department store industries opened at 10:00 this morning, sales were very competitive until 4:00 PM. After posting a sign saying "Please come early tomorrow," they closed one after another. The Economic Control Authority held an emergency meeting today, approving various industries to operate on a set schedule from 9:00 AM to 5:00 PM, and advising on opening up sources and supplying as much as possible to maintain the appearance of the city.</p>
<p>[Our Wuhu Dispatch, 6th] A shopping spree has swept into Wuhu. Silk and cloth shops and foreign goods stores are all crowded and have stopped selling early. Department stores and grocery stores have a lot of goods and are still open. Yarn gold is out of stock and has been out of stock for many days. The rice market has been out of stock for three days, and a black market has emerged. Those responsible for economic control seem to be waiting for the new decisions of the Nanjing Economic Control Conference and have taken no action. Poor people who cannot buy rice are complaining.</p>
<p>[Our Hankou Dispatch, 6th] After a period of price fluctuations in Hankou, some goods have disappeared again. Citizens are rushing to buy daily necessities in the markets starting today to store them. Customers are crowding the national goods company. The order is chaotic, resulting in them being forced to lock the doors and refuse to sell. According to a police investigation, more than 500 shops throughout the city are hoarding goods and selling them privately, and rising prices and black markets are becoming increasingly rampant.</p>
<p>[Our Beiping Dispatch, 6th] After the panic buying wind swept Beiping, the first such phenomenon occurred on Wangfujing Street. At 11:00 AM on the 6th, the entrances to department stores, woolen fabric shops, and cloth shops on Wangfujing Street were extremely crowded. In the afternoon, it spread to Qianmen Xidan, so many shops closed at 4:00 PM. People are extremely uneasy. After the police department asked the municipal government for instructions, the Social Affairs Bureau and the Police Department are now negotiating a solution. Most of the panic buyers are vendors and merchants.</p>

<p>[Our Nantong Dispatch, 6th] Yesterday, the native cloth market received more than 18,000 feet of cloth, setting an unprecedented record. After selling cloth, machine households used cloth strips to purchase yarn from yarn shops, resulting in an insufficient supply of cotton yarn throughout the city. The cloth sold was equivalent to 500 pieces of yarn, but the yarn sold was still short 200 pieces. The weaving households negotiated with the yarn industry association, and they agreed to register and gradually ration the yarn before dispersing. The native cloth market was specially closed today for one day to facilitate the yarn shops' continued supply of cotton yarn.</p>

<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 6th] News from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs: Since the communist riots in Malaya, the British authorities have arrested a large number of suspected criminals under emergency laws, among whom overseas Chinese account for the majority. According to Article 7 of the Sino-British New Treaty, whenever an overseas Chinese is arrested, the local government should notify our consulate. This provision, in addition to being implemented in Singapore after our negotiations last October, has not yet been implemented in Malaya due to the implementation of the new constitutional system and our adjustment of consulates. In order to intensify the protection of overseas Chinese, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has instructed our Consulate General in Singapore to negotiate with the British side that the treaty should still be implemented. Subsequently, the consulate replied that the British side had agreed to do so, but that Malaya would have to wait until the areas of jurisdiction of the new consulates were determined and they were officially opened before it could be implemented. Now that our consulates in Malaya have been established separately, and the areas of jurisdiction of each consulate have also been notified to the British authorities, the Consulate General in Kuala Lumpur has sent a letter to the Malayan authorities requesting immediate implementation. According to reliable sources, the Government of the Federation of Malaya has instructed the police to notify our relevant consulates immediately when overseas Chinese are arrested. Article 7 of the Sino-British New Treaty has now been implemented throughout Malaya.</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper, Hankou, 6th] Hu Shi gave a lecture in Hankou on the 6th, discussing his observations on the international situation. He began by pointing out the tragic defeat of Germany and Japan as the greatest tragedy of the past 50 years. He also cited Zhang Qun's report on his visit to Japan, reiterating that the United States would not support the rearmament of Japan. Regarding whether a third world war is imminent, Hu Shi stated that the main factor leading to war is the mutual suspicion among major powers. The First World War occurred because Britain was unwilling to show its cards, and America's attitude was ambiguous. The formation of the Second World War was due to America's failure to truly show its cards initially, leading Japan to mistakenly believe in America's neutrality facade and launch the war. Hu Shi said that now the United States has declared its "firm" and "patient" stance. If the attitudes of the major powers can remain clear, then a major war can be avoided. However, Hu Shi warned the audience that humans are the most foolish creatures. If someone, like Hitler, stubbornly refuses to believe this card, then the effect of showing one's hand will be limited, and the global situation remains far from optimistic. After successful mining explosions at the Iron Ore Bureau, September's output increased to 95,000 tons. Further explosions of more than 100,000 tons before November will complete this year's output.

The Allied Headquarters has decided to send engineer Ye Luobi to Hainan again to assist in mining. As for the first batch of 250,000 tons of ore to be shipped to Japan, 210,000 tons have already been shipped.</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 6th] Du Jimei, Speaker of the Chahar Provincial Assembly, Cui Yunshan, Councilor, Bai Baojin, Director of the Department of Finance, and other representatives from Chahar Province who are petitioning in Nanjing, have been continuously calling on central government authorities in Nanjing to appeal regarding the situation in Chahar Province. Du and others held a reception for reporters at 3 pm on the afternoon of the 6th, reporting on the recent situation in Chahar Province and the demands of the people. Du and others pointed out in their report that Chahar Province is rich in resources and located at the forefront of national defense. In the past, the Japanese were keen to develop it, but our central government has not given it special attention. Chahar Province has a population of only 2.7 million. It has contributed troops and supplies to support the suppression of rebellion. In the past two years, it has contributed 150,000 troops, accounting for 15% of the able-bodied men, all of whom are fighting outside the province. There are only security teams in the province, lacking sufficient salaries and equipment, and the central government continues to neglect Chahar Province. The allocation of relief supplies is very small, and the treatment of public school teachers and civil servants is divided into provincial and county levels, making it impossible for the Department of Finance to distribute salaries. They put forward ten demands: (1) Reasonably allocate the collection of in-kind taxes and requisitions, and purchase military grain and fodder at market prices; (2) Please promptly allocate funds for the newly formed two cavalry security regiments, including expenses for food, salaries, equipment, and horses, and support the local armed forces that have already been established; (3) Please promptly reimburse the 185,134 Gold Yuan spent on repairing national defense works; (4) Please provide relief to 8,800 students in the war zone of Yanji and Zhangjiakou, and add 600 publicly funded students in the second half of the year's budget, establishing a temporary middle school in Chahar; (5) Please subsidize the province's general budget for the second half of the year; (6) Allocate subsidies for the demobilization of Mongolian banners; (7) Please have the relevant departments and ministries resolve the problems of highways, bridges, and telephone equipment in Chahar Province; (8) All public school teachers and civil servants in Chahar Province should be paid according to the standards of the provincial capital; (9) Please have the Four Banks Joint Office allocate industrial and mining loans; (10) Please have the central government allocate 200,000 Gold Yuan to provide relief to more than 32,000 refugees, orphans, and students in Linji, Xuanhua, Zhangjiakou, and Kangzhuang.</p>

<h3 id="e55">Major Japanese Bribery Scandal Implicates the Government: Ashida Cabinet to Submit Resignation Today; Socialist Party Withdraws Support for the Government Due to Nishio's Sudden Re-arrest; Yoshida Shigeru Seems Likely to Make a Comeback <a href="#e55" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c55" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">55</a></h3>
<p>[New Asia News Agency, Tokyo, 6th] The Ashida Cabinet decided to hold an extraordinary cabinet meeting on the morning of the 7th to collect the resignations of the cabinet members. They will then visit MacArthur to report on the process of the collective resignation before formally completing the resignation procedures.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 6th] After the Ashida Cabinet decided to resign collectively on the 7th, some people predicted that the next cabinet would be based on national unity, that is, a coalition government formed by the extremely conservative Democratic Liberal Party, Democratic Party, Social Democratic Party, and National Cooperative Party, with a member of the Democratic Liberal Party as prime minister. If so, then former Prime Minister Yoshida Shigeru may take office as prime minister for the third time.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Tokyo, 6th] Senior government officials said on the 6th that the Ashida Cabinet, which has been in power for seven months, will resign after holding an emergency meeting on the morning of the 7th as a result of the development of the Showa Denko bribery scandal. The government stated that Ashida's decision to resign was issued after the Social Democratic Party held a central executive committee meeting on the afternoon of the 6th and decided to withdraw its support for the cabinet. The Social Democratic Party is one of the three pillars of the cabinet. The party held a central executive committee meeting to discuss the position of the cabinet after former Deputy Prime Minister Nishio was arrested on the morning of the 6th. The left-wing members of the party had "demanded the resignation of the cabinet" after the arrest of the Director-General of the Economic Stabilization Board, Kurusu, last week. Although Nishio is one of the leaders of the party, he resigned from his position as Deputy Prime Minister several months ago due to a case of accepting bribes from a contractor. This time, he was involved in the Showa Denko case again. The party leaders voted on the 6th to demand the resignation of the government due to the public moral responsibility of cabinet members being arrested. Ashida convened a meeting of the leaders of the three government parties on the evening of the 6th. It is said that the cabinet had no other option but to resign. At this meeting, the leader of the Social Democratic Party, Katayama Tetsu, had already decided to demand the resignation of the cabinet. If Ashida refused, the party would withdraw from the cabinet. The party occupies six ministries in the cabinet, and this action will certainly determine the fate of the Ashida Cabinet.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Tokyo, 6th] Former Secretary-General of the Japanese Socialist Party and former Deputy Prime Minister Nishio was arrested by the police on the morning of the 6th in connection with the Showa Denko bribery case. Nishio appeared at the Ministry of Justice at 6:40 a.m. and is expected to be detained in prison tonight. Officials from the Ministry of Justice searched his residence in Tokyo this morning and reportedly found many incriminating documents. Sato of Mitsubishi Heavy Industries was also summoned to the Ministry of Justice. It is said that he had persuaded Nishio to settle the Showa Denko bribery case. It is also said that Nishio had received millions of yen in bribes from Showa Denko. The chairman of the company, Hinohara Mizu, has been charged with illegally borrowing loans from the government's Financial Reconstruction Corporation and has been imprisoned for several days. Leaders from major Japanese business and financial circles who are related to this case have also been imprisoned. The first leader of the Democratic Liberal Party to be arrested was Ono, who was arrested last month. In addition, Ozawa, a member of the Democratic Liberal Party, was also arrested last night on suspicion of bribing Kurusu, the Director-General of the Economic Stabilization Board. Kurusu himself was arrested on September 30 in connection with the Showa Denko case.</p>
<h3 id="e56">The United States Decides to Maintain Its Position in Berlin: Willing to Open a Foreign Ministers' Conference If the Blockade Is Lifted; Soviet Representative Attends Security Council and Listens to Jessup's Speech <a href="#e56" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c56" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">56</a></h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Report] Paris, Radio on the 6th: When the Security Council met on the morning of the 6th to debate the Berlin crisis, Soviet Representative Vyshinsky sat quietly and listened. At first, he expressed concern, and then gradually showed boredom. At the second meeting in the afternoon, Vyshinsky returned to the conference room, but he still did not indicate whether he would break his silence and participate in the debate.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Paris, 6th] The Security Council convened at 10:50 a.m. this morning. U.S. Representative Jessup declared that the United States would never yield to the Soviet Union's blockade of Berlin. At that time, Soviet Representative Vyshinsky sat silently in the hall listening to the American statement. At the same time, Jessup proposed a compromise solution, saying that if the Soviet Union lifted the Berlin blockade, the West would be willing to meet with it at a foreign ministers' conference. Although Vyshinsky had denounced the UN General Assembly's debate on the Berlin crisis as an "illegal" act on the 5th and said that he would boycott it, he still attended on the 6th to listen to the West's accusations against Soviet policy. He arrived 20 minutes late, but Chairman Brahmaglia of Argentina waited for Vyshinsky and the young Ukrainian representative Tarasenko to sit down at the horseshoe-shaped table before announcing the start of the meeting.</p>
<p>Jessup used strong language, indirectly warning the Soviet Union that the United States would use force if necessary to maintain its position in Berlin. He accused the Soviet Union of using "methods of aggressive action and hostile threats" to implement the "illegal" blockade of Berlin's railways and waterways, infringing on the rights and responsibilities of the United States stationed there. Jessup was calm and his tone was moving. He first read the preface to his speech for ten minutes, saying, "The world knows that the Soviet Union is illegally using the threat of force to obstruct the Western countries' access to Berlin." He also said that the United Nations Charter recognizes the need and right to self-defense in the event of an armed attack. If the action is aggressive and threatens the use of force, it is still an act of aggression and a threat to peace, even if it does not immediately lead to armed conflict." Jessup proposed a "strong and decisive formula" to resolve the Berlin crisis, but without further explanation, only pointing out two possible immediate steps: (1) If the blockade is lifted, convene a foreign ministers' conference; (2) The Security Council can still use peaceful resolution methods such as negotiation, inquiry, mediation, conciliation, and legal judgment.</p>
<p>While Jessup was speaking, Vyshinsky listened attentively and took notes from time to time, sometimes reading the newspaper.</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper Report] Paris, Radio on the 6th: When the Security Council met in the afternoon, British Representative Cadogan said, "The British government is deeply regretful to learn that the Soviet delegation is unwilling to participate in the discussion of the Berlin issue. Does the Soviet Union have no opinion, or has it decided to refuse any proposal from the Security Council in silence? Is this the Soviet delegation's way of seeking peace and understanding? If one party refuses to participate in the discussion, how can we resolve the dispute?" Cadogan made the same suggestion: If the Soviet Union lifts the Berlin blockade, a four-power foreign ministers' conference can be convened. The Security Council adjourned on the evening of the 6th and may be postponed until next week to give the Soviet Union the opportunity to consider accepting the Western proposal.</p>

<p>[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 6th] British Representative McNeil raised the following three questions to the Soviet delegation: (1) Does the Soviet Union agree to the implementation of international control before the draft treaty on the prohibition of atomic weapons and the draft treaty on atomic control are signed and take effect simultaneously; (2) Is the Soviet delegation prepared to accept the report of the majority of countries as the basis for establishing the control treaty; (3) Is the Soviet Union willing to not use the veto power of the permanent members of the Security Council for international organizations entrusted with control powers. Soviet Representative Malik replied that the Soviet Union requires the simultaneous implementation of the two draft treaties in the proposal, one on control and one on the prohibition of atomic weapons.</p>

<p>[United States Information Service, Washington, 5th] The White House announced today that Secretary of State Marshall will fly back to Washington on Saturday to report to President Truman on the progress of the Paris UN General Assembly meeting. Presidential Press Secretary Ross said that Marshall's return home does not indicate any special crisis, but is because the President wants to hear the Secretary of State's oral report. Marshall is leading the U.S. delegation to attend the meeting in Paris and will arrive here on Saturday morning on the President's special plane "Independence."</p>
<p>This morning, Dulles met with Republican presidential candidate Dewey in Albany, New York, to discuss the international situation. After the meeting, Dewey issued the following statement: "Dulles has reported to me on the current international situation, especially the serious problems caused by Soviet policy. I have analyzed the important issues involved, and I have expressed my opinions to him. Dulles will return to Paris tomorrow to continue his work as a member of the bipartisan delegation, which represents a united United States in the United Nations."</p>
<h3 id="e62">Marshall Formally Denies the Rumor That the U.S. Forced France to Hold Elections; The Report That Three Parties in France Will Form a Government Is Actually Impossible <a href="#e62" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c62" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">62</a></h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Paris, 5th] U.S. Secretary of State Marshall completely denied on the 5th the rumor that the United States is pressuring France to hold elections. The U.S. Embassy issued a statement by Marshall saying: "Secretary of State Marshall authorized the U.S. Embassy to clearly deny the reports in the Paris newspapers that the U.S. government had warned the French government that it should hold elections as soon as possible and take certain concrete steps if it wants U.S. aid to France to continue. This statement has no basis in fact."</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 5th] Qualified sources today denounced the recent rumors that the Socialist Party, the Popular Republican Movement, and the Communist Party will restore the "three-party government" as an impossible "fantasy." The sources pointed out that the basis of the above rumors is that two left-wing members of the Popular Republican Movement are said to have asked representatives of the Republican and Resistance Movement Alliance (the Communist Party's allied party) to join the government, but the latter replied that their party was too small and that the Popular Republican Movement should invite the Communist Party to join instead. However, there has been no new development since then, so the rumors of a three-party government are quite unreliable. The sources emphasized that neither the Socialist Party nor the Popular Republican Movement is willing to form a coalition government with the Communist Party, so a three-party government is actually impossible. As for Prime Minister Queuille's Radical Socialist Party, although it is willing to unite with the left wing, it is also willing to unite with the right wing, which is unacceptable to the Communist Party. The sources concluded that the middle parties are still trying to maintain a middle position between the Communist Party and the de Gaulle faction. When it is impossible to maintain this position, it will be decided whether to turn to the left or the right.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 6th] The Democratic and Social Union of Resistance Movements of the French Liberal Party decided at its steering committee meeting last night that the party would continue to participate in the Queuille cabinet. Some members of the party are dissatisfied with the government's wage and price policies and want to break away from the government.</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper Report] San Francisco, Radio on the 6th: Wallace gave a speech at the Federal Club on the 6th, launching a fierce attack on U.S. foreign policy. He said that some U.S. military officers have openly admitted that the United States is supplying aircraft and artillery to President Chiang, building China into an attack base, and preparing to participate in the war that the military is happily planning. Wallace quoted General Chennault's report to Congress in March this year, saying that modern bombers departing from Chinese airfields are closer to Soviet industrial areas than U.S. bases. Indeed, air strikes from Chinese airfields could isolate Siberia east of Lake Baikal. Chinese bases are even closer than North African bases. Wallace declared that General Marshall's efforts to form a unified and stable government in China were almost the last gasp of U.S. foreign policy. Wallace expressed his fear of war, saying, "I know that these things are not entirely our fault, nor are they the fault of other countries. At present, no country is surrounding us with bases, accumulating atomic bombs, and publishing plans to destroy us and our industry, but we are doing these things every day and every hour." Wallace also attacked Truman's policy of aiding countries fighting communism.</p>

<p>[Associated Press, Washington, 6th] It was learned on the 6th that the Greek government has suddenly asked the United States for more funds to supplement the Greek army due to the continued rise of guerrilla activities. The State Department acknowledged this fact, just after President Truman submitted an optimistic report to Congress on the aid plan to Greece on the 5th.

<h3 id="e74">Supervisory Office Orders Resolution of Civilian Food Supply; Rice Industry Representatives Pledge to Transport 200,000 Dan per Month to the Market; Guarantee to Continue Selling at Limited Prices <a href="#e74" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c74" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">74</a></h3>
<p>[Our Report] Recently, the rice supply in this city has been disrupted. Yesterday, only 43 dan of rice arrived at the North and South Markets. The Supervisory Office is paying close attention to this abnormal phenomenon and believes that a small number of rice merchants are secretly causing difficulties in order to create a food shortage and force the authorities to concede, thus fulfilling their desire to undermine price controls. Yesterday afternoon, Wan Molin and the managers of the North and South Markets, Yin Fuxiang and Xu Songshi, were summoned to the office for a discussion. Secretary Cai Baili met with them and requested Yin and Xu to be responsible for transporting 300,000 dan of rice from other places to Shanghai each month. Because the two indicated that it was difficult to agree to this, the dispute shifted in time. Secretary Cai angrily left his seat and returned to the supervisor's office to report. At that time, Chiang Ching-kuo's attitude was very tough, and he ordered that if Wan, Yin, and Xu could not be responsible for the supply of rice to Shanghai, they would be severely punished. After the repeated persuasion of Major Cheng Yi-kuan, Yin and Xu first made a pledge to be responsible for transporting 100,000 dan of rice from other cities to Shanghai each month for each market. Wan Molin also subsequently made a pledge to ensure that the city's rice shops continue to supply rice at limited prices. After the three made their pledges, Secretary Cai also stated face-to-face that he hoped that the three, with their leading positions in the rice industry, would persuade rice merchants to transport rice to Shanghai. If the control is successful, they will be permanently appreciated by the citizens. The conversation ended at 6:15 pm. When the two sides were arguing fiercely, it hit the outdoors. The personnel of the supervisor's office immediately announced: Under any circumstances, the price of rice will not rise.</p>
<p>Manufacturers Can Apply to Purchase on Their Own</p>
<p>[Our Report] New grains from various places have gradually entered the market. For the rice needed by various factories, companies, banks, and other business organizations, in addition to entrusting legitimate grain merchants to go to the producing areas to purchase successively in accordance with central regulations and not to compete for purchases in the market, those who directly purchase from the rice-producing areas are allowed to apply to the bureau for a purchase permit. However, each purchase must not exceed two months of actual needs. The procedures stipulate that the applicant must clearly state the number of people currently employed, the quantity to be purchased, the variety, and the location, and send a letter directly to the bureau's fourth section. After the section lists and signs the director for approval, it can be filled out and issued. This expedient measure has been reported separately and will be implemented from today.</p>
<h3 id="e75">Legitimate Merchants in Various Places Are Still Allowed to Purchase and Transport Goods; Applications Can Be Made with Official Documents from the Guild <a href="#e75" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c75" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">75</a></h3>
<p>[Our Report] Since the authorities restricted the amount of daily necessities carried by passengers leaving the country by sea, land, and air to no more than one person's needs yesterday, the craze for panic buying has subsided slightly. However, the daily necessities of various cities in the interior originally relied on Shanghai for transportation, and there will now be panic. According to Wu Kaixian, director of the Social Affairs Bureau, the original intention of the restriction measure was to crack down on "single haulers" (illegal peddlers). The authorities will still permit legitimate merchants from various places to purchase and transport goods. The industry association can prepare official documents to apply to the supervisor's office, so that the government can also know the statistics of domestic sales. Currently, some places have applied to the supervisor's office for transporting sugar and cloth out of the country.</p>
<p>In addition, the Supervisor's Office announced: If factories along the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou railway lines need raw materials and equipment, they can first obtain a certificate from the local industry association, and then purchase after approval by the Shanghai District Supervisor's Office.</p>

<p>[Our Report] Wu Kaixian, director of the Social Affairs Bureau, said yesterday: The bureau is now concentrating its efforts on restricting citizens' consumption. To eliminate the current bad phenomenon, a strict and universal rationing system should be adopted, and the rationing of oil and coal can be restored in the short term. Regarding the issue of national identification cards, which is closely related to rationing, he has discussed it with Supervisor Chiang and suggested conducting another thorough census. It is planned to issue various commodity rationing certificates based on national identification cards. In the future, citizens will need to hold these two documents to purchase daily necessities, and the store selling the goods will cross out the goods sold on the rationing certificate. The current emergency method of stamping a "goods purchased" seal on the national identification card will be prone to being filled.</p>

<p>[Our Report] Representatives from the Western-style clothing and fashion industry went to the Social Affairs Bureau yesterday to request direct allocation of woolen fabrics to reduce intermediate exploitation and restrict citizens from ordering clothes, with each person limited to one suit every six months based on their national identification card. It is said that there are currently orders for Western suits that will not be delivered until next year. Customers' psychology is abnormal, and they are willing to pay first and pick up the goods several months later. Currently, most Western clothing merchants need several months to complete all orders. Fashion shops have the same phenomenon. The Social Affairs Bureau is reported to be convening relevant industries for discussion.</p>

<p>[Our Report] The Golden Star and Huafu fountain pens, both domestic products, have been out of stock in the market recently.

The bureau has submitted it to the supervisor for approval and sent it to the municipal government for execution.</p>

<p>[Our Report] The edible oil market in this city has been ordered to stop trading from today. The Social Affairs Bureau stipulates that citizens must purchase edible oil with a household registration certificate from today, limited to one jin per person per month.

<p>Consideration Being Given to Restoring Fines for Exceeding Electricity Usage</p>
<p>[Our Report] This city has decided in principle to implement electricity conservation and prohibit the use of electric heating. According to Zhao Zengjue, director of the Public Utilities Bureau yesterday, electric stoves may be allowed for use. However, the use of electric hot plates, like electric stoves, is a waste of electricity, so they will also be prohibited. The Public Utilities Bureau has ordered various power companies to count the users of electric stoves and electric hot plates for review and decision on the implementation methods. In addition, regarding the method of fining for exceeding electricity usage, Huopujin, the person in charge of Shanghai Electric Power Company, proposed to restore it, and the authorities are currently considering it.</p>

<h3 id="e92">Shanghai Journalists Association Sacrifices to Martyr Shao Xubai <a href="#e92" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c92" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">92</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Journalists Association, because its former member, Martyr Shao Xubai, was assassinated in Shanghai on July 1, 1940, and died heroically, the Shao Martyr Burial Committee has chosen the 7th of this month to bury him in his ancestral cemetery in Maoshan, Yin County. Therefore, a sacrificial text is offered to show loyalty and comfort the heroic spirit. The sacrificial text is recorded as follows: "On October 7, the thirty-seventh year of the Republic of China, the Shanghai Journalists Association, respectfully offers clear wine and delicacies to the spirit of Martyr Shao Xubai, saying: Alas! The Japanese pirates were rampant, and they snatched Dong Hu's pen; the treacherous and cunning traitors lost the warrior's life. The light of the law was fleeting, and there were grievances for eight years. Recalling the past, it is difficult to describe with a pen. Alas, how sad! Thinking of Mr. Shao, his talent was unparalleled. He studied in Nanjing and devoted himself to writing. His family was poor and he dropped out of school, but he was skilled in trade. When the revolutionary army rose up, he participated in the secrets, valuing death over life, consistent from beginning to end. When Liaodong launched a revolt, he comforted the righteous army in the border provinces. When Li Deng arrived in the west, he submitted a strategy of ten thousand words. At the beginning of the resistance against the enemy, he formed a society for commentary, supported the national policy, and intentionally planned for survival. His pen was stern, the wind rose and rushed, exposing treachery and subduing, and the group swallowed. How could the villains be jealous of his talent, first with wealth, and then with poison, never resigning from death, his body became benevolence, and the righteousness is always there, how sad! His integrity was unflawed, and he never retreated. Heaven blessed China, and gave birth to this extraordinary talent. The auspicious signs were water divination, and the woodcutters did not destroy the mother. The cassia and orchid will be sacrificed to comfort the spirit in the spring. The spirit in the spring will know, and the soul will return, alas, how sad! May you enjoy the sacrifice.</p>

<p>[Our Report] The Central Mint is scheduled to officially resume work on the 10th. It is said that the first coins to be minted are one-cent copper subsidiary coins, and 300,000 coins can be produced every day. Although half-dollar silver coins have also been actively planned, the existing machines are not very suitable, so it has been decided to postpone minting for the time being, and new coin minting machines will be rushed.

<h3 id="e94">Interception at the North Station; Raw Materials for Drug Trafficking Privately Transported; Source and Destination Clarified; Wang Xiaofu's Scene is Lavish <a href="#e94" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c94" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">94</a></h3>
<p>[Our Report] At 11:25 pm the day before yesterday, in front of the gate of the Beijing-Shanghai District Railway Administration on Minde Road, a small railway worker came with a travel bag, intending to cross the administration plaza to the station. The gate guard saw that his behavior was suspicious and went forward to check. There were ten paper packages in the bag, each containing four yellow lumps. He said that it was a Western medicine entrusted by a friend and asked him to send it to the station. At that time, Inspector Du Gongtang happened to be patrolling here and recognized that the yellow substance was the raw material for manufacturing the drug heroin. He brought the small worker to the police station for questioning. According to the worker, the item was entrusted to him by his former neighbor named Xue Zhiguang. Xue himself was waiting at the station, intending to take the 16th Beijing-Shanghai night train to Beijing. Inspector Du and others disguised themselves and went to the station to arrest Xue. However, at this time, the 16th train had already departed, and the platform was empty. However, it was expected that Xue would not leave before obtaining the drug, so a secret search was carried out. Later, Xue was found in an empty car. At that time, the suspect Xue offered a bribe of 100 yuan in gold and a gold ring. The railway police severely rebuked him and took Xue to the interrogation office. Xue confessed to privately carrying drugs and said: The item was given to me by Yan Huisheng at the Wulu Electric Tram Station and I planned to take it to No. 1 Guapu Bridge, Erpailou, Nanjing. Yan also originally intended to go with me that night, but he has already fled. The source of the drug was provided by Wang Xiaofu. Wang's scene is very lavish on weekdays, and he has his own car to travel in and out. He only knows that he often bathes in the Shuanglongquan Bathhouse in Nanshi, but he does not know where his home is. The police department has sent personnel to investigate, but Wang has received the news and fled. He is currently being arrested from all sides.</p>
<h3 id="e95">Zhou Zhiguang's Case of Inciting Workers Adjourned Pending Judgment <a href="#e95" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c95" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">95</a></h3>
<p>[Our Report] Zhang Zhiguang, who was dismissed by Zhang Yunju at No. 27, Huangpi South Road, was accused of inviting hundreds of workers from various factories at around 10 pm on July 10 to gather at the intersection of Huixi Street and Xuhong Road to openly give speeches, incite workers to stop working, and obstruct order in order to demand a pay raise from the capitalist. The District Court opened the trial yesterday. Bao Weiran, chairman of the Textile Workers Union, and Wang Guangxing, a director, testified in court: Ju gathered more than 100 workers on Xuhong Road that night and incited a strike by giving speeches. Zhou and his defense lawyer then defended, strongly denying that Bao and Wang's testimony was untrue. They said that the work stoppages in various factories were not due to his incitement: (1) The Huashang Electric Company stopped supplying electricity on July 11, and various factories stopped working due to the lack of electricity. (2) Ma Jindi and Weng Guangrong, workers at Zhang Yunjii, had a dispute over a fight, which caused the workers of various factories to stop working. They were involved in a lawsuit in court for injury, which was later mediated, and there are court records to prove it. (3) The number of workers gathered by Bao that night was different from what Wang said. (4) The labor-capital negotiations of the Municipal Party Committee and the Social Affairs Bureau invited representatives of the labor side to participate, which proves that Ju is a person who does not have the facts of the crime as charged. The court considered that the case was clear and scheduled to pronounce judgment in three days.</p>
<h3 id="e96">Chiang Ching-kuo Broadcasts to the City, Pointing Out the Path for Citizens to Take, Enduring Temporary Pain to Put the Economy on the Right Track <a href="#e96" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c96" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">96</a></h3>
<p>Chiang Ching-kuo (pictured), the Economic Control Supervisor for the Shanghai District, delivered a broadcast to all citizens of Shanghai at 8:00 PM last night via Shanghai Radio, elaborating on the current economic control work and future directions. The text of his speech is as follows:</p>
<p>Dear fellow citizens of Shanghai: It has been 41 days since the government promulgated the Emergency Decree on Finance and Economy. In this short period, the government has implemented currency reform, stabilizing the soaring prices. This is the result of the government and the people working together with one heart and one mind. However, this is only the initial success of implementing the new economic policy. To consolidate and develop this initial success, we must continue to work hard to achieve the goals of stabilizing society and improving people's lives. In the past month, Shanghai citizens have exchanged 1,100,5652 taels of gold, 32,800,3894 US dollars, plus silver, silver dollars and Hong Kong dollars, totaling 372 million Gold Yuan. This accounts for 64% of the total amount exchanged nationwide. This figure shows how much the citizens of Shanghai support the government's currency reform policy, enriching the reserves of the Gold Yuan and providing greater assurance for the success of the currency reform. In the future, the government must strengthen economic control work to stabilize prices in the long term, thereby stabilizing people's lives.</p>
<p>We Will Surely Achieve the Goal of Increased Production</p>
<p>We demand price stability. First, the government's budget must be balanced. Second, production must be increased to match supply and demand. Third, we must practice thrift and reduce consumption. Fourth, we must eliminate hoarding and destroy the black market. The government is engaged in suppressing the rebellion for the survival of the country, so all expenditures are naturally quite large. To increase revenue, tax collection must be streamlined. The recent increase in tobacco and alcohol taxes is an important measure to balance revenue and expenditure. To ensure price stability, no taxes have been added to necessities that affect people's lives. Regarding increasing production, the government is now trying to help factories purchase raw materials from home and abroad. Considering the existing raw materials in Shanghai, the reserves of many types are quite sufficient. The current problem is to find ways to channel idle funds into production. Although this work is currently facing many difficulties, once the economy is on the right track, the goal of increasing production will surely be achieved. However, we must know that while increasing production, we must also practice thrift and reduce consumption. I hope all citizens can tighten their belts to overcome today's difficulties and uphold the spirit of self-reliance to build our country. The rationing system we are about to implement is not only for stabilizing life but also for saving consumption. Hoarding and speculation are factors that disrupt the market. In the past month and a half, the economic control authorities have taken the strictest measures to eliminate black market trading and all other speculative activities. In the future, we must continue to prevent the revival of speculative activities. As long as speculative activities are not eliminated, prices cannot be stabilized. In the future, anyone who violates the government's economic control laws will be severely punished according to law. Therefore, I hope that the people and the government can cooperate more closely to eliminate the speculative market. The ultimate goal of economic control is to put industry and commerce on the right track. Before August 19th, the deposits of Shanghai commercial banks, calculated in Gold Yuan, were only 6 million Gold Yuan, but recently, deposits have increased to 200 million Gold Yuan. Before August 19th, the interest rate was at least seven cents, but now it has fallen to five or six cents. To take a small matter as an example, due to the crackdown on speculative activities, the number of telephone calls used by Shanghai citizens last month has decreased by 40% compared to August. These facts all prove that the Shanghai economy is on the road to normalization. If bank deposits were used for production, that would be a further success.</p>
<p>Firmly Upholding the "August 19th" Price Limit</p>
<p>In recent days, some citizens have been anxious all day long, buying goods everywhere. Not only wool, cashmere yarn, and cloth have been purchased in large quantities, but even tin foil has been heavily acquired. This mentality is very abnormal. Yesterday, a friend told me that he had already bought 25 shi of rice, and also bought a lot of soybean oil, coal, and soap, so he wouldn't have to worry for a year. This concept is absolutely wrong. Ask yourself, if your family has food to eat, but one thousand or ten thousand people have no food to eat, can you eat quietly? This concept is not only wrong but also foolish. The phenomenon of "behind vermilion gates, meat and wine go to waste, while on the road lie corpses frozen to death" is absolutely not allowed. The government has stated that except for the increased tax on tobacco and alcohol, the prices of other goods have not been increased, and the prices of daily necessities must strictly adhere to the "August 19th" price limit. At the same time, the inventory in Shanghai is still quite sufficient. I can tell everyone that Shanghai has 6.5 million bolts of cotton cloth, 100,000 pieces of yarn, 200,000 dan of oil, and 80,000 tons of sugar. As for rice, in addition to the 500,000 zu monthly ration provided by the government, the rice supplied by rice merchants to the market only needs 250,000 shi. According to Mr. Yang Chuoan, the source of government-allocated rice will not be a problem, not only for October but also for the quantity required for November and December. The rice currently registered in rice shops is about 200,000 shi, excluding miscellaneous grains. In addition, the government has also entrusted the Farmers Bank and the Central Cooperative Treasury to purchase rice in Hunan, Jiangxi, and Sichuan to supply the Shanghai market. This year's harvest is also quite good, so although the current source is not very smooth, it will definitely not cause any problems. Looking at it this way, the citizens of Shanghai can rest assured and don't need to be afraid of anything. What we fear today is not a shortage of goods but a panic. If the government strictly controls prices on the one hand and the people can be content and abide by the law on the other hand, then the necessary supplies for the people will definitely not be a problem. The most important thing is that everyone should be at ease and not panic at rumors. Recently, to implement comprehensive economic control, the government has expanded the control scope of the Shanghai District to Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, and Nanjing provinces and cities. I believe that price regulation and control within the expanded scope will achieve better results. Today, I can honestly tell all the citizens of Shanghai that controlling prices and regulating materials is indeed quite difficult. For example, regarding the reorganization of the vegetable markets, we have spent a lot of effort and have not yet reorganized them well, which is sorry to the general residents. The source of rice has not been completely smooth, which is also not a very good phenomenon. Many merchants have told me that as long as the price is increased, everything will come in abundance, but it is not that simple. According to past experience, all prices will increase by one point today and another point tomorrow, until there is no end. Therefore, I firmly stated that I would rather endure temporarily than absolutely adhere to the "August 19th" price limit. We must know that as long as there is one price concession, it will affect the overall situation. To ensure that prices can be stabilized for a long time, we must grit our teeth, work hard, and thoroughly implement the established policies. As for the places where the "August 19th" prices are not very reasonable, they can naturally be adjusted to allow industry to reproduce. But the so-called adjustment is not a price increase but simply to make the entire economy reasonable and get on the right track.</p>
<p>Not Letting Speculators Dream Again</p>
<p>I have carefully observed and realized that the people of Shanghai have recently reflected an abnormal mentality. It is said that in the past month, the business of Shanghai dance halls, cinemas, and theaters, teahouses, and restaurants has been unprecedentedly lively. There are also a particularly large number of people traveling to Hangzhou, Suzhou, and Beijing. The mentality of the general rich is mostly to live a life of "drink today while you have wine, spend today while you have money." Everyone often says that they cannot buy pork, but the number of pigs slaughtered in September was more than 10,000 more than in August. According to statistics, from July 19th to August 18th, it was 74,380, while from August 19th to September 18th, it was 86,991. These are all reflections of an abnormal mentality. We must correct this. At this moment, while I am speaking here, I am afraid that many people are still drinking and dancing wildly. How painful and pitiful are the men, women, old, and young begging on the streets now. Among them, there are probably many people who were once wealthy and influential. This contrast reminds us of the ancient Chinese saying that "extreme joy begets sorrow," which is worthy of our reflection and vigilance. I earnestly tell everyone: Today, we should pay more attention to the country's difficulties and sympathize with the people's suffering. Only when the interests of the country and the people are protected can individuals have freedom and survival. Some people in Shanghai should really wake up from their life of drunken stupor, be born again, and embark on the bright path. In the future, the citizens of Shanghai have two paths to take: The first path is to maintain the superficial prosperity, where the rich can buy whatever they want, let the speculative market flourish again, let the speculators who fled to Hong Kong, Hangzhou, Suzhou, and Moganshan return to Shanghai, and stir up trouble again, disrupt the market, causing prices to soar and people to live in poverty. This is the first path. The second path is to be able to endure temporary pain, go through a difficult period, and even experience a temporary recession. Naturally, only one of these two paths can be taken. I hope everyone can use all their strength to prevent the first path and not let speculators dream of speculation again. As for the second path, as long as everyone is willing to endure difficulties and give up personal and temporary interests, it is definitely a passable path, and it is a path that must be taken.</p>
<p>Finally, I want to explain to everyone that I am very strict with the people participating in the economic control work in the Shanghai District, but because of the large number of people, there must be a mix of good and bad. Any cadres participating in economic control work who engage in deception and extortion outside, please do not show any mercy to tell me, and I will definitely deal with them severely. As for myself, I often feel that there are inevitably many mistakes. As the saying goes, "bystanders see clearer," you must see more clearly. I earnestly hope that everyone will point out my mistakes and criticize my shortcomings, and I will be happy to accept them. Today, when we do things, we should do what should be done and say what should be said, with unity from top to bottom and concerted efforts, to complete this arduous task. I feel very ashamed that I have not completed my own task in a month and a half of work. In the future, under the leadership of Mr. Yu Hongjun, I will do my best and work diligently to repay the expectations of the citizens of Shanghai. I wish you all good health!</p>
<h3 id="e97">Appeal of the Dance Craze Case, First Trial Concluded, Main Points of the Defendants' Statements, All Claiming Not to Have Handed in Destruction <a href="#e97" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c97" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">97</a></h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] The Dance Craze Case was concluded in the first trial by a division of the High Court yesterday, with sentencing scheduled for the 13th of this month.</p>
<p>The case was heard yesterday by the High Court bench, comprising President Si Wen, and judges Han Shuzhi and Zhao Qia, with Prosecutor Ye Yushao appearing in court for the prosecution. The defendants who appeared for appeal were Jin Meihong, Sun Zhimin, Meng Yan, Jin Ying, Li Meijuan, Shi Meifang, Qin Xianfen, Yu Zhiqin, Gu Keren, Pan Zhiguang, Wang Fulin, Zhu Caigen, Zhao Aqing, Lu Jialin, Li Ying, Xia Shaotang, Chen Ayiao, Wang Xianliang, Cheng Yinkang, Xu Jiecai, and twenty others. Ruan Jianmin did not report to the court. The defendants in custody who were brought to the court were Zhu Fei, Zhao Zhengxiang, Yu Jinbao, and Zeng Zhigang. Also present was Jin Tangshi, the mother of the defendant Jin Ying, and witness Yang Lili. Another defendant, Xu Jinhua, filed a temporary motion to withdraw her appeal and accepted the one-year prison sentence. Jin Meihong, Sun Zhimin, and Meng Yan, who are of particular interest, all appeared without makeup, dressed plainly, and sat side by side on the left end of the second row of the audience. Sun Hongyuan and Zheng Wei Xian, heads of the Dance Industry Association, were also in attendance.</p>
<p>Jin Ying's Mother Claims Her Daughter is Not a Dancer</p>
<p>The court opened at 9:00 AM. Each defendant stated the main points of the indictment. The general sense was that although they had participated in a petition to the Social Bureau, they had not laid a hand in the destruction. They stated they were dissatisfied with the prison sentences handed down by the District Court. Witness Yang Lili reversed her previous testimony, claiming that she did not see Jin Meihong, Sun Zhimin, Meng Yan, or others actually engage in destruction. As for her previous testimony, she said that the police station had forced her to sign it. Jin Tangshi stated that her daughter Jin Ying had made friends carelessly and had been associating with a dancer named Chen Juping. On that day, Chen Juping had invited her to watch the excitement at Xin Xian Lin, and her daughter was not a dancer and had not participated in the destruction of the Social Bureau. Jin Ying wept and said: I am still studying, and if I serve my sentence (three months), it will definitely affect my studies. The trial ended at around 12:00 PM.</p>
<p>Forced by Life Circumstances, the Situation is Not Entirely Unforgivable</p>
<p>The debate began at 2:00 PM. Prosecutor Ye stood up and argued that the defendants were all forced by life circumstances. Upon hearing of the dance ban, they were emotionally driven to destroy the Social Bureau. Although there is a suspicion of obstructing official duties under the law, the circumstances are not entirely unforgivable. The prosecutor asked the Criminal Court to consider the circumstances and reduce the sentences as a sign of compassion. Each of the defendants' lawyers then made their arguments. At the end of the court session, the case was scheduled for sentencing on the 13th of this month, and the court adjourned at 4:30 PM.</p>

<h3 id="e105">Talking about Xiangfan by the side of Mount Longzhong <a href="#e105" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c105" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">105</a></h3>
<p>— Special Correspondent of This Newspaper, Ling Songsheng</p>
<p>[Dispatch from Xuan Chang, This Newspaper, 1st of the Month] As Xiangfan becomes a cornerstone for the National Army to shield the Jianghan region during the current intense fighting in the Henan-Hubei border area, and especially after the strength of the Wanxi local troops was significantly reduced this spring, Xiangfan holds inestimable importance in monitoring the actions of the bandit Kong who dreams of entering Sichuan through the Shaanxi-Henan border. In fact, regardless of "crossing the river" or "entering Sichuan", considering the current strength and plans of the Communist bandits, they are unwilling to easily take action and deplete their forces in the short term. However, given the evolving objective environment, if the Communist bandits genuinely want to expand their roaming area outside the Central Plains battlefield, Xiangfan will invariably be a thorn in their side.</p>
<p>Patrolling Along the Han River Embankment</p>
<p>Upon arriving in Xiangyang, the reporter, together with Pang Guineng, the deputy regimental commander of a certain regiment stationed in Xicheng, rode along the Han River embankment to inspect the western suburbs of Xiangyang, where the fighting was more intense. About four or five Chinese miles west of Xiangyang city, there are three hills: Zhenwu Mountain, Lion Mountain, and Yanghu Mountain. Under normal circumstances, these three hills would certainly need to be controlled. Firstly, to block the enemy's advance with firepower and shield Xiangyang, and secondly, to prevent the enemy from occupying them and threatening Xiangyang's urban area with artillery fire. However, in the Xiangfan campaign, the bandit side did not carry any heavy weapons, so the second effect of controlling the hills was lost. Moreover, the defending forces were weak and could not reliably maintain communication lines between our army's positions and the hilltop garrison. As a result, when the Catholic Church west of the city was occupied by the enemy and the access route to the mountains was cut off, the hilltop garrison had to retreat and enter the city via the South Gate.</p>
<p>After Xiangfan was heavily besieged on the 9th, it was not until the 15th that the bandits broke through. There was a week of relative calm in between. During these days, the Communist bandits worked day and night to dig trenches, extending from their base directly to the west city of Xiangyang, in order to reduce their casualties. The reporter and Deputy Regimental Commander Pang patrolled the western suburbs and saw winding trenches stretching westward for dozens of miles. This was originally a clumsy method, but the Communist bandits insisted on using this clumsy method to achieve some success. As for the scattered white bones and skulls on the ground, with flesh and blood eroded by the wind and rain of the past two months, they were everywhere. Listening to the autumn wind howling through the trees and the tide of the Han River, one can only say that they were a kind of embellishment on the battlefield, with no other greater significance.</p>
<p>General Kang Ze's Mystery of Life and Death</p>
<p>After Xiangyang fell to the bandits, the whereabouts of General Kang Ze, commander of the 15th Pacification Zone, became a matter of national concern. According to Mr. Li Langxing, responsible for the 5th District of Hubei, he told the reporter that when the bandits occupied the Pacification Zone, Commander Kang attempted to commit suicide with a gun in the basement, the bullet hitting his left shoulder. His guards quickly seized the gun. Mr. Li and Commander Kang were captured at the same time. (Mr. Li did not witness Mr. Kang's suicide attempt because they were separated by a considerable distance when captured. This was later told by Commander Kang's guards.) After being captured, Mr. Li seized an opportunity to escape from Xiangyang that night. As for Commander Kang after being captured, there were three versions of the story: (1) Some said that he died soon after being captured due to severe injuries. (2) Others said that Mr. Kang was still alive, and the bandit side was treating his wounds. (3) Still others said that after Mr. Kang was captured, the bandit side carefully treated his wounds, but Mr. Kang refused to yield and refused treatment or food, and eventually died for his country in Kanghe County, Henan. According to the broadcast of the Communist New China Radio, Kang Ze died on July 28, and based on other intelligence, to verify Mr. Kang's personality, the third version of the story is very likely. (Note: According to Fan Longxiang, director of the Political Work Department of the former Chuan-Shaanxi-Hubei Border Region Pacification Headquarters, the above information has been confirmed). The death of a national general is naturally an irreparable regret and loss for the government and the people across the country who were concerned about Mr. Kang. However, Xiangfan has after all been recovered. As long as the place where General Kang was martyred – Xiangfan – forever becomes a strong fortress for suppressing the rebellion, thereby shielding the heartland of Jianghan and Sichuan, then General Kang's sacrifice cannot be said to be without value.</p>
<p>Traces of Bullets Everywhere at the Old Site of the Pacification Zone</p>
<p>After arriving in Xiangyang, the reporter and Secretary Wang Shancheng of the Political Work Department of a certain unit stationed in Xiangyang visited the old site of the 15th Pacification Zone in the shadow of the setting sun. There were traces of bullets everywhere on the dilapidated walls, which were all symbols of the wounds inflicted by the Communist bandits on the nation. The basement, where Commander Kang unsuccessfully attempted suicide, has now become a pile of rubble. Secretary Wang told the reporter that after the Xiangfan battle ended, more than a dozen of our soldiers, carrying a machine gun, lurked in the basement. One day, when the Communist bandits were preparing to search the basement, they opened fire with their machine gun, causing many casualties to the Communist bandits, and they even spread rumors of ghosts. This is enough to prove the morale of the Communist soldiers today. These dozen or so people were safe and sound in the basement, surviving on a small amount of dry food, until they were transferred to the rear after the recovery.</p>
<p>The reporter had a casual conversation with Wu Chongyan, deputy division commander, and Ren Jingxiu, chief of staff, of a certain garrison division about the future defense of Xiangfan. They believed that the fall of Xiangfan was partly due to insufficient external conditions and partly due to shortcomings in personnel matters. Given the good terrain of Xiangfan, they had great confidence in the defense here. Both of them are famous generals on the battlefield. Ren had brilliant military exploits in the Que Mountain campaign in southern Henan, and Wu in the Teng County campaign in southern Shandong. During the bitter defense of Teng County last summer, Wu invented a method of using car lights to replace flares, which greatly threatened the Communist bandits' night activities. During his tenure as Chief of Staff, Chen Cheng issued an order to all troops across the country to follow his example.</p>
<p>Calm and Quiet Outside Xiangfan</p>
<p>The area outside Xiangfan is currently quite calm. North of Fancheng, twenty or thirty Chinese miles away, there are occasional small-scale skirmishes. The Communist bandits' strength is limited, and they dare not act rashly. To the west, the elite troops of the Xth Army Corps are taking Nanzhang as their core and sweeping through the mountains in three routes. The Xiangsha Road, under the maintenance of the military, is open for transportation. Regarding the defense outside Xiangfan, if we want to be absolutely safe, the best strategy is to capture Laohekou and Xinye to form a mutual support situation and shield Xiangfan. However, due to limited troops, it is difficult to talk about it for the time being. Of course, with Commander Yang Gancai's past successful experience and prestige in the Teng County, Fangcheng, and Que Mountain battles, where he won victories through large-scale bloody battles against the Communist bandits, the safety of Xiangfan is not a concern. General Yang often fishes by the Han River in his spare time, and this leisurely sentiment can set off the tranquility of northern Hubei. The scenery of Mount Longzhong and the waves of the Han River are expected to bring a refreshing change to the situation in northern Hubei with the rising autumn wind.</p>
<h3 id="e106">The International Background of the Greek Border Conflict (Part 1) <a href="#e106" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c106" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">106</a></h3>
<p>— Special Correspondent of This Newspaper in Europe, Xin Feng</p>
<p>The Greek issue is listed as a major case on the agenda of the Third United Nations General Assembly. This case originated from the complaint filed by the Greek government to the Security Council in December 1946. Greece believed that the banditry in its northern border was entirely instigated by its northern neighbors, Albania, Yugoslavia, and Bulgaria, with military assistance. However, the three countries believed that the cause of the unrest was the poor political situation of the Greek government itself and had nothing to do with the three countries. After discussion, the Security Council dispatched a commission to investigate incidents on the Greek border, composed of the eleven member countries of the Security Council, to conduct on-the-spot investigations in the four countries concerned. The Chinese representative was Ambassador Jin Wenshi, and the deputy representative was Minister Xue Guangqian. After half a year, a report was produced. The majority opinion was that the northern border of Greece was indeed supported by the three countries. It was recommended that the Security Council order the three countries to stop assisting the Greek bandits in creating disturbances, and it was also advocated that all disputes involving the four countries should be resolved by peaceful means. After two months of discussion by the Security Council, there was no result due to the Soviet Union's use of the veto power. It was submitted to the Second United Nations General Assembly held in New York in September last year for discussion. The General Assembly passed a resolution on October 21 last year to organize a United Nations Special Committee on the Balkans. On the one hand, countries sent patrolmen to patrol the northern border of Greece to see if the three countries continued to provide military assistance to the Greek bandits in creating disturbances. On the other hand, they tried their best to mediate and resolve issues such as good-neighborly relations, border agreements, refugee repatriation, and free exchange of ethnic minorities, in order to ease the strained relations between the three countries and Greece and reduce the fundamental causes of friction. The committee was originally planned to be composed of eleven countries, including China, the United States, the United Kingdom, France, the Soviet Union, Brazil, Mexico, the Netherlands, Australia, Pakistan, and Poland. However, the Soviet Union and Poland refused to participate from the beginning. So in fact, it was composed of only nine countries. The US representative was Admiral Kirk, the US ambassador to Belgium, the UK representative was Sir Seymour, the former British ambassador to China, the Mexican representative was former Foreign Minister Gastinro, and the Dutch representative was former Navy Minister Zai Baoxian, all of whom were prominent figures of the time. The Chinese representative was Minister Xue Guangqian, and the deputy representative was Zhao Junxin. Minister Xue had been stationed in Europe for many years and had participated in the Greek investigation, so he was familiar with the matter and handled it with ease. The headquarters was established in Thessaloniki, northern Greece, in November last year, but the meeting place has recently been moved to Athens, the capital of Greece. Each country sent 40 border patrolmen, mostly from the UK and the US. China sent three people to participate: Gui Zongyao, Ji Zhiren, and Yang Fengqi. They were stationed on the borders of Greece-Albania, Greece-South, and Greece-</p>
<p>Bulgaria. They were in the midst of gunfire every day, risking their lives in all sorts of dangers. Once, when Gui Zongyao was patrolling the Greek-Bulgarian border, he encountered a landmine explosion, killing more than a dozen people. Mr. Gui narrowly escaped. Recently, he was hit by shrapnel on the Greek-Albanian border. It is said that the Greek government specially instructed its ambassador to China to express condolences to your Foreign Ministry. US Secretary of State Marshall also sent a special telegram to our representative Xue Guangqian, expressing his deep condolences. Last week, An Zhiren was shot by Greek bandits with machine guns when he was patrolling on a special plane, and more than a dozen bullets hit him. He barely managed to land, fortunately without causing an accident. This spring, when the Greek bandits raided Thessaloniki in the middle of the night, they fired more than 90 mortar shells into the city for two hours. One of them landed outside Minister Xue's bedroom, only two yards away. At that time, the doors and windows were destroyed, and the danger was evident. When people talk about Palestine, everyone is terrified. Little do they know that the situation in the Balkans is even more difficult and dangerous, and the chaos is even deeper than in the Jewish holy city. The committee has been established for ten months now. In addition to strengthening the confirmation of the continued support of the three countries to the Greek bandits based on the results of the patrol, there has been no progress in the mediation and resolution work because the three countries refused to cooperate with the committee. The committee first produced a general report on June 30, and then produced a supplementary report on September 10, listing the facts, conclusions, and recommendations, and submitted them to this General Assembly for discussion. Everyone knows that the Greek issue is not limited to the disputes between Greece and the three countries. The root cause is still between the United Kingdom and the United States and the Soviet Union. If the United Kingdom and the United States and the Soviet Union cannot reach an understanding, it is feared that this General Assembly discussion will be difficult to achieve results. The Greek government intends to ask the General Assembly to send international armed forces to blockade its northern border, which is more than 1,000 kilometers long. However, according to Article 43 of the United Nations Charter, the international armed forces should be placed under the Security Council. Due to the confrontation between the Soviet Union and China, the United Kingdom, the United States, and France, it has fallen into a stalemate and has not yet been realized. Therefore, the Greek government's wish is nothing more than drawing cakes to satisfy hunger. The international background of the Greek border will be described as follows for reference.</p>
<p>The Geographical Situation of the Northern Border of Greece</p>
<p>It is almost impossible to study the relationship between Greece and its northern neighbors, Albania, Yugoslavia, and Bulgaria, before understanding their geographical situation. The northern border of Greece stretches for about 840 miles from Albania through Yugoslavia and Bulgaria. Generally speaking, the border area, except for the eastern section of the Greek-Bulgarian border, is a mountainous area. Greece is geographically a corner of the Balkan Peninsula and also a piece of land in the Mediterranean. The terrain of the Balkans is rugged, with undulating hills. In the area where Greece borders its three northern neighbors, countless valleys are separated among them. There are only a few places where roads can pass. There is no major road from Albania to Greece, only one road from Albania to the center of the Balkan Peninsula, and finally to Thessaloniki and Istanbul. In addition, there are several passages in Sarantoporos and other places on the Albanian-Greek border. The border between Greece and Yugoslavia has an international passage that runs from southern Belgrade through Nish and Skoplje, along the Morava and Vardar rivers, through Gevgeli to Thessaloniki. The other minor passes on the southern border of Greece are mainly some routes in the Beles region. The main passage on the border between Greece and Bulgaria runs south from Sofia through Greek territory to Adrianople in Turkey. There are also several minor passages. Historically, Greece has been invaded by enemies from the north, south, east, and west. Because Greece is located half on land and half on the sea, it is not only threatened by the north on land, but also attacked by sea because its people must rely on the sea for their livelihood.</p>
<p>For centuries, the geographical location of the northern border of Greece has not changed, but the importance of its situation has changed with the times. Especially after the Second World War (1947 to 1948), as a result of the confrontation between the Soviet Union and the United Kingdom and the United States, Greece was the first to bear the brunt. Because of its increasingly complex relationship with its three northern neighbors, the current situation on the northern border of Greece can be outlined in the memorandum submitted by the Greek government to the United Nations Special Committee on the Balkans on December 8 last year:</p>
<p>"The borders of Greece with Albania, Bulgaria, and Yugoslavia have now been completely abandoned. For a year and a half, the Greek border guards have been attacked from time to time, and countless defending soldiers have been killed and captured.</p>

<p>[Dispatch from Wuxi, This Newspaper, 5th of the Month] In Dangku District, Houtaizhen, North River Street, in the county, several peach trees in the courtyard of resident Cao Genda's home have recently blossomed.

<h3 id="e108">Salted Duck in Southern Anhui <a href="#e108" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c108" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">108</a></h3>
<p>— Special Correspondent of This Newspaper, Yu Ningpo</p>
<p>[Dispatch from Huizhou, This Newspaper, 3rd of the Month] At a time when there is a chicken and egg panic in the Jiangnan area, it may be welcome by readers to have the reporter report on the salted duck in southern Anhui. Salted duck, also known as salted duck, has always been a famous product of Nanjing, followed by Wuhu in southern Anhui. In fact, the source of Nanjing salted duck, in addition to some from Gaochun and Liuhe, is mostly purchased from Wuhu, Xuancheng, Hefei, and other places. Wuhu is particularly rich in duck production due to the Qingyi River and Chaohu streams. In the 17th and 18th years of the Republic of China, the annual output of raw ducks was always more than four million. The sales of salted ducks in Wuhu market were about one million per year. After the 19th year of the Republic of China, although the market in Nanjing and Wuhu was not prosperous, the consumption of salted ducks still maintained a large part of the original sales, remaining strong and unyielding.</p>
<p>Production and Sales</p>
<p>The origin of raw ducks is quite wide, with two types: domestic ducks and wild ducks. Domestic ducks are hatched by farmers themselves, while wild ducks are produced in the reeds of rivers and lakes. Gaochun, Liuhe, Gaoyou and other places in Jiangsu Province are rich in raw ducks, and farmers also raise a lot of them. Farmers in Wuhu, Xuancheng, Dangtu, Datong, Guichi, Hefei and other places in southern Anhui raise even more ducks than in Jiangsu Province. The Qingyi River in the south and the Chaohu Lake and Heyuezhou in Datong in the center are particularly rich in wild duck production. Every year from September to January of the following year, during these five months, it is the time when fat ducks are on the market. Merchants from Nanjing and Wuhu duck shops come to the production areas to buy from duck vendors, because direct transactions are fairer in price.</p>
<p>The annual output of raw ducks in southern and central Anhui is three to four million. There are more than 100 duck shops in Nanjing, most of which are opened by Muslims. The annual sales are from two million to one million five to six hundred thousand. The sales of ducks in Wuhu market are not as good as in Nanjing, because the capital has a larger population and more travelers, so the sales of salted ducks will still be guaranteed in the future.</p>
<p>Production</p>
<p>Salted duck production mostly uses fat, raw ducks, and diseased or dead ducks are discarded. The brine for marinating ducks is better the older it is. This brine is the essence juice boiled with salt, and the taste of ducks boiled with fresh brine is worse.</p>
<p>The method is to slaughter the duck, remove the large and small feathers, cut a small hole under the wings, take out the internal organs, wash the inside of the duck's abdomen, so that no blood remains inside, then stuff salt into the abdomen and smear it all over the body. Each duck must use four taels of salt. After about 24 hours, the salt water turns into blood water. Then pour out the salt water in the abdomen, soak it in the old brine for about 12 hours, take it out and hang it on a hook, wait for the wind to dry the moisture, and it becomes the famous product of salted duck.</p>
<p>The period for making salted duck is most suitable in the months after autumn and before spring. After the spring is warm, the duck shops will stop making it. If there is a need, they will also engage in production, and the procedure is still the same, but the time for marinating in the old brine should be shortened, because the weather is warm and the salty taste is easily absorbed. In spring and autumn, the marinating time should be 12 hours, and in summer, it only needs 3 hours.</p>
<p>Cooking Method</p>
<p>Salted duck is a famous product of Jiangnan, so people who live in Nanjing and Wuhu, or travelers passing by, always buy a few salted ducks when they return to their hometown to give to relatives and friends. When the Jianglun approaches the Nanjing and Wuhu docks, the small stalls selling salted ducks rush to the ship to sell. The passengers on the ship also buy one or two of this delicacy to add to their meals and drink with wine.</p>
<p>If the cooking method of salted duck is not proper, the taste will naturally be unpleasant. The best cooking method is to boil the water, then put the duck in, then add 20% pure water, cover the pot with a lid, preferably a small lid, so that the duck does not float on the surface of the water, and at the same time turn off the stove fire. After about 50 minutes or an hour, boil the water in the pot with the duck until it is 80% cooked (until small bubbles are found), take the duck out, pour out the accumulated water in the abdomen, put it back in the pot, and cook it with a little cold water over a low fire for about an hour. The taste will naturally be extremely delicious.</p>

<h3 id="e109">Announced Yesterday by the Superintendent's Office: No Shortage of Industrial Raw Materials <a href="#e109" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c109" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">109</a></h3>
<p>[Dispatch from This Newspaper] The Superintendent's Office takes increasing production as a matter of utmost urgency, so it pays special attention to investigating the inventory of raw materials in the city. It is now learned that the industry has compiled a detailed list of the required amount of 15 major raw materials and sent it to the Materials Adjustment Committee of the Superintendent's Office for reference. According to the office, the inventory of diesel and gasoline among the various industrial raw materials can last for four months. For cotton, a large amount of US-aided cotton has been shipped and has begun to be distributed, so there is no worry of shortage in two or three months. Since raw cotton is supplied, there is no problem with cotton yarn. Yongli Company and Taiwan can fully supply both caustic soda and purified alkali. For Chilean nitrate, the Central Bank has a large storage in the past and can supply the market demand as much as possible. As for the supply and demand situation of dyes, according to the estimate of the Dyeing Industry Association, the monthly demand is 450,000 pounds, and the China Trust Bureau currently has a storage of 1.8 million pounds, which is enough for four months. For alum, there are regulations in the import quota, so the source is not lacking. In addition, shipping companies usually sell a large amount of raw materials such as factory iron, which can meet the needs of the market. So in fact, the raw material problem is not as serious as expected.</p>
<h3 id="e110">Cotton Yarn Market Stagnation: Yarn Merchants Plan Joint Distribution <a href="#e110" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c110" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">110</a></h3>
<p>Cotton Yarn Business Association Director Tang Zhiliang yesterday met with Supervisor Jiang, requesting early approval of the business scope of yarn merchants and offering advice on the establishment of a joint cotton yarn distribution center. His reasoning was based on the following three points:</p>
<p>(1) After trading in the cotton yarn market ceased, among all member yarn firms, only retailers still intended to hold inventory for business. However, once the inventory is sold out, they will also face the same stagnation. Regarding their business scope, they request early approval to maintain their livelihood.</p>
<p>(2) Cotton yarn wholesalers, who promote yarn mill products as far as Southeast Asia and the Near East to meet the needs of handicrafts in various cities and towns, propose that yarn mill products, in addition to direct distribution to local replicating industries, be distributed by all yarn merchants through a jointly organized distribution center, dividing into two groups: local retailers and domestic and foreign bulk distributors, defining their business scope. As for how to allocate, a detailed plan will be submitted for approval after the principles are decided. If this plan is feasible, yarn merchants can have fixed business after the market stops, and the supply and demand of cotton yarn in local and foreign regions can also tend towards normalcy.</p>
<p>(3) The yarn industry directly and indirectly employs tens of thousands of people. If yarn merchants' businesses are not allowed to continue, it will increase unemployment and affect society.</p>
<p>Production Estimate</p>
<p>According to information recently obtained from the Materials Adjustment Committee: Regarding the export of yarn and cloth from this city, after a decision was made in a previous meeting to conduct planned exports based on actual production and consumption, preliminary estimates of the production and consumption quantities have been completed. The total monthly output of all factories in this city is estimated to be over 90,000 pieces. After supplying the city's monthly need of about 50,000 pieces, 20,000 pieces will be exported to foreign countries to exchange for raw cotton, and 20,000 pieces will be sold to the inland.</p>
<p>According to Deputy Director Li Lixia of the committee, who told reporters yesterday morning, there is no fear of a yarn and cloth supply shortage at present, as the number of working spindles in factories across the country is approximately 4.4 million or more, only about 20% less than before the war, while the purchasing power of the general public is more than 20% lower than before the war. As for the supply of raw cotton, the authorities are also making every effort to find a solution. It is estimated that 60% of the raw cotton needed nationwide in the future can be supplied domestically, and the remaining 40% will be exchanged from foreign countries.</p>
<p>Central Textile Distribution</p>
<p>The cotton yarn and cotton cloth markets in this city remain closed. Yesterday, the Textile Construction Company, as usual, opened up distribution of eight types of yarn. Among them, 40-count TK Sunlight brand yarn was limited to clothing industry purchases; 40 and 60-count Sunlight were limited to handkerchief industry purchases; 10-count doubled yarn was limited to canvas industry purchases; and 16-count coarse yarn was limited to towel industry purchases. As for 20-count yarn, distribution was temporarily suspended because the Central Bank and the General Administration had not delivered the goods.</p>
<p>Also, due to the monetary authority's control of materials, both the yarn and cloth markets have stopped gathering, causing replicating manufacturers in other areas to have no place to purchase raw materials. They had previously applied to the Textile Construction Company, seeking to enjoy the same distribution and purchase rights as manufacturers in this city. This matter has now been satisfactorily resolved, and they will be approved for distribution in the next round.</p>
<p>The cotton cloth market continues to be closed. The cloth industry association still represents the dyeing and weaving industry association in handling the second round of cloth distribution, distributing more than 25,000 bolts of assorted colored cloth. All member retail cloth stores of the association can apply for purchase. In addition, it is supplying more than 40,000 bolts of cloth on behalf of private dyeing factories, limited to member purchases.</p>
<p>The trend of panic buying has been prevalent in the market recently. Flying Wheel thread is still being supplied as much as possible. It is said that the foreign exchange earned from sales in Southeast Asia and India is exchanged with Textile Construction for cotton yarn, so the raw materials for thread making are not lacking.</p>
<p>Quiet Cotton Market</p>
<p>Yesterday, the spot cotton market was quiet, with a slight turning point. Various grades of coarse and fine cotton linters were still not traded, people were quiet, and the market atmosphere was still cold. Zhoupu seed cotton was traded slightly, as scheduled.</p>
<h3 id="e111">Cotton Cloth Industry Notice to Members: No Early Closing <a href="#e111" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c111" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">111</a></h3>
<p>The Cotton Cloth Industry Association recently stated that, as citizens' panic buying of cotton cloth is intensifying, especially for the cotton cloth industry, most cotton cloth retail stores are closing early, causing panic in the market and greatly affecting people's minds. Yesterday, a special notice was issued to all members to prioritize the country and the nation, act cautiously, and comply with the prescribed hours: (1) Monday to Saturday, from 9:00 AM to 6:00 PM; (2) Sundays from 10:00 AM to 5:00 PM.</p>
<h3 id="e112">Stable Silk Market <a href="#e112" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c112" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">112</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the market sentiment for rayon silk was slightly calmer, with sporadic transactions. Local retail sales were still brisk, but Japanese goods in various grades were out of stock, and Italian goods of various brands were also slow to sell. Association distribution continued as usual. Due to the high price of raw silk, many buyers were watching and waiting. The silk weaving industry was also weak due to the cost of silk materials exceeding the cost of finished products, and their purchasing appetite was very low.</p>
<p>Local sales of silk satin remained brisk, but most were female-oriented and floral-patterned goods that were frequently snapped up. Winter menswear goods were also in demand. The supply and sale of quilt covers from factories was scarce, and interest was also weak, resulting in a sluggish market.</p>
<h3 id="e113">Statistics on Sales of State-Owned Enterprise Stocks <a href="#e113" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c113" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">113</a></h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] Yesterday, a total of 18,500 gold yuan of state-owned enterprise stocks were sold, bringing the total to 4,037,400 gold yuan before transportation. The sales figures for each type of stock are as follows: Textile Construction 2,861,000 yuan, China Merchants 45,500 yuan, Taiwan Sugar 1,035,200 yuan, Combined Paper 91,700 yuan, Tianjin Paper 4,000 yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e114">Measures for Insurance Industry Capital Increase Still Awaiting Approval <a href="#e114" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c114" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">114</a></h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] Amidst the wave of capital increases in the banking industry, there are rumors that the financial authorities are also actively drafting measures for capital increases in the insurance industry, and there is talk of stipulating that the minimum capital of each insurance company be 200,000 yuan. Yesterday, the reporter inquired with Director Lin of the Financial Control Bureau about the Ministry of Finance's handling of the capital increase for this industry. Director Lin replied: Regarding the measures for the capital increase of the insurance industry, no order has yet been received from the Ministry, and it is still awaiting approval.</p>
<p>However, according to the views of leading figures in the insurance industry here, the capital increase of the insurance industry is clearly different from that of the banking industry. The financial authorities' management of the insurance industry should focus on the industry's retained premium and reinsurance amount, while the amount of capital is actually a secondary issue.</p>
<p>It is reported that the insurance industry's opinion is that a more appropriate minimum capital for each company would be 100,000 yuan after the capital increase. If the minimum capital requirement is too high, it will reduce investment in the insurance industry, further reducing insurance companies, resulting in only a few remaining insurance companies unable to bear huge insurance amounts, and massive reinsurance abroad, which would only harm the country's foreign exchange. Therefore, they believe that the financial authorities can use this capital increase opportunity to formulate a reasonable capital increase amount, while carefully paying attention to the retained premium and reinsurance amount of the industry, which would more easily promote the development of China's insurance industry.</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper] Since the issuance of the gold yuan, a large amount of old legal tender has been collected, estimated to be over 100 trillion. The Central Bank's treasury has made a decision on how to handle this legal tender. That is, in all collection areas where there are paper mills, the legal tender will be purchased by the paper mills as papermaking raw material. If the paper mill is too far away and the purchase price offered by the paper mill is not enough to cover the freight costs, then it will be destroyed. As for the huge amount of legal tender collected in this city, it will be sold to paper mills by auction once it has been sorted out.</p>
<h3 id="e116">First Allocation of American Cotton Totaling Approximately 70,000 Bales <a href="#e116" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c116" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">116</a></h3>
<p>According to the United American Aid Cotton Yarn and Cloth Joint Operating Office: The total amount of American aid cotton is expected to be more than 300,000 bales (500 pounds per bale), which will be allocated in three or four installments depending on the arrival of each batch. The first allocation is 69,518 bales.</p>
<p>The proportional standard for the first allocation is based on the American aid cotton allocation principle, which should be allocated in proportion to the number of working spindles in domestic textile factories. The proportion for the first allocation is based on the current total number of 4,419,452 working spindles in national and private yarn mills, with each working spindle receiving approximately 0.0157 bales of American aid cotton (calculated as a percentage, state-owned yarn mills account for 40.07%, private yarn mills account for 58.2%, and foreign-owned yarn mills account for 1%).</p>
<p>The first allocation of American cotton is divided into 31 types according to length and grade. There are approximately 230 yarn mills receiving the allocation, and the types of yarn and cloth converted are numerous. Therefore, the procedures are quite cumbersome under the conditions of fair and cautious error prevention.</p>
<p>Since the work began in mid-September, as of now, 87 yarn mills that have submitted formal applications have been signed and delivery orders have been issued. In addition to approximately 10,000 bales allocated from Tianjin and Qingdao, according to reports from warehouses in Shanghai, more than 6,000 bales of Sichuan cotton have been issued. In recent days, manufacturers who have received delivery orders are being urged to pick them up.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper] At the fourth meeting of the National Cotton Joint Purchasing Committee the other day, after passing the cases of comprehensive joint purchasing and expanding the joint purchasing fund to 150 million yuan, Committee Member Li Lixia has now brought the cases to Beijing last night so that they can be submitted to today's Executive Yuan regular meeting for approval and implementation.</p>
<h3 id="e117">Less Than 50 Bushels Arrived: Rice Market Almost Completely Shut Down, Flour Mills' Raw Material Source Exhausted <a href="#e117" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c117" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">117</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the total amount of rice arriving was less than 50 bushels, only 43 bushels, which can be said to have disappeared. All 43 bushels were delivered to the South Market, including 8 bushels of white japonica, 25 bushels of thin indica, and 10 bushels of milled indica, all sold at the limited price. This tiny amount can be said to be a drop in the ocean, so trading can be said to have not taken place. The North Market had no deliveries at all, so trading was completely stopped. The industry all closed early.</p>
<p>Flour</p>
<p>Trading has not started, as before. Not only has the market stopped, but the raw material wheat for Japanese factories has also been exhausted. Future production is a major concern.</p>
<p>Miscellaneous Grains</p>
<p>Trading has entered its final stage. Soybean transactions are few and far between, with only 20-30 bags of Poyang seed beans and about 50-60 bags of winter beans traded, all acquired by local merchants who were quick on their feet. Sesame supply has decreased, and the market is firm. More than 100 bags of raw peanuts from Xuzhou were offered. No other grains were offered.</p>
<p>Edible Oil</p>
<p>Transactions are infrequent. Yesterday, the China Grease Company distributed 250 barrels of old-barrel cooked vegetable oil, each barrel containing 375 catties, priced at 43.3 yuan. Each retailer received one barrel. Also, manufacturers had planned to distribute soybean oil and vegetable oil through a joint sale yesterday morning, upon presentation of the market permit to the designated manufacturers, but the China Vegetation Factory portion was not distributed. There were still no soybean cake transactions.</p>

<p>Yesterday, in the foreign tea market, although the buying interest from exporters was like bamboo shoots after the rain, growing rapidly without restraint, sellers still believed that goods from the producing areas were scarce and prices were high. Therefore, they were unwilling to easily let go of the goods in their hands. As a result of negotiations between the two sides, the situation mostly remained in a stalemate. The process, after being silent for a long time, has not yet recovered, but the market atmosphere is extraordinarily stable and brisk. As for domestic sales of tea, there is also more demand than supply, and prices are firm.</p>
<h3 id="e119">Sugar Prices Hover <a href="#e119" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c119" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">119</a></h3>
<p>The sugar market was stable yesterday, with sentiment firm but slightly soft, and prices hovering. Trading within the market was slow. Sellers were unwilling to sell, and buyers' purchasing appetite was also very limited. The market closed with a slight improvement. The 22nd issue of granulated white sugar warehouse receipts was not traded. Medium sugar and local factory white sugar rose slightly by one or two jiao. Trading in No. 45 car white refined sugar was very cold, with no change in price. Xinghua high white sugar retreated slightly, while tenth sugar was dull and trading was sparse. The rest remained unchanged.</p>

<h3 id="e145">What Are We Waiting For? <a href="#e145" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c145" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">145</a></h3>
<p>-- Wu Yong</p>
<p>In a short essay titled "Waiting," R. L. Evans said something to the effect that many people are waiting, not really knowing what they are waiting for, but still inexplicably waiting, and life quietly passes by in the waiting. A father longs to spend more time with his son when he has more free time; a mother genuinely wants to pay more attention to her daughter's affairs; but while waiting for the opportunity, time waits for no one, and the daughter gets married and the son establishes his own family and moves away. Some people are constantly thinking of breaking bad habits and constantly thinking of having more contact with friends. But when will they put it into practice? People seem to forget that daily life is our life. So-called life refers to the era we live in, the day we are going through, and every hour. Whether we are disappointed or bored, this is our life. The author ends by asking: What are we waiting for?</p>
<p>What are we waiting for? Speaking personally, I feel quite lost.</p>
<p>In searching for that short essay, I found three similar essays in American magazines, which shows how much this idea is valued in America. I haven't read many books, but after searching my mind, I found that there is no such idea in Chinese philosophy. Zhuangzi advocates the merging of self with others and all things, and does not encourage people to value the future, but at the same time he also tells you not to value the present; Yang Zhu said something like "Enjoy the present, why worry about the afterlife," which seems a bit like it on the surface, but its real meaning is to tell you to passively enjoy life in a timely manner, not to actively focus on the present. The ancient poem: "Life is not as long as a hundred years, but often worries about a thousand years," also focuses on the negative. This idea does not seem to have been encountered in Confucianism, and it is even less likely to be found in Buddhism. Is the reason why it doesn't exist because it is too ordinary? This is beyond my knowledge.</p>
<p>The focus of our traditional thinking is to overestimate the future, such as "thrift," such as "diligence," such as "looking ahead," such as "foresight," all of which are centered on the future. Generally, the reason why Americans are diligent is that their goal is not thrift. If their goal is the word "thrift," why bother being diligent? As for the Bible's saying "Do not worry about tomorrow, for tomorrow will worry about itself," old gentlemen immersed in traditional thinking might even regard it as heresy. But the strange thing is: the more you worry about the "future," the more you risk losing the "present." Because you value the unknowable future, you lose your own center of gravity, which is to lose yourself.</p>
<p>A person's life is ultimately made up of many "todays"; a country's destiny is ultimately formed by a majority of "individuals." If the whole country is just waiting for the future and ignoring the present, the fate of a country composed of people who have lost their center of gravity can be imagined. But in fact, many of us have indeed lost our center of gravity. These people are really extremely kind people. These people are happy when they hear that American loans are promising, and worried when American loans are hopeless. When they hear that someone is going abroad, they turn around to inquire whether the news is true, looking panicked, as if everything depends on this one move; if they find out that someone is just spending foreign exchange, they immediately sigh, thinking that everything is over from now on; when they learn that he is indeed going for a loan, they suddenly place great expectations on him again. With so many rumors in this city, if a person focuses on how so-and-so will be, he can spend the whole day neglecting his own business and still be busy. In fact, "things must happen, and principles must be followed," and any truly important thing in the future can be accurately inferred from the past, so why give it unnecessary expectations? What is important is you today.</p>
<p>Otherwise, since the Republic of China, first there were several years of "extraordinary times," followed by eight years of the "War of Resistance period," and now it is the "Suppression of Rebellion period." We must wait for the arrival of a normal period of peace. We may grow old and accomplish nothing. What's more, if we look through history, we know that the world has never been normal.</p>
<p>Therefore, we might as well change Yang Zhu's words and use them as our motto: "Care about today, why worry about tomorrow!"</p>
<h3 id="e146">Metaphor <a href="#e146" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c146" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">146</a></h3>
<p>-- Cong Zhi</p>
<p>U.S. Secretary of Commerce Harriman held a press conference, expressing the hope to maintain friendly relations with the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>A female reporter interrupted him. She asked, "Since the two countries cannot coordinate politically, is a friendly trade relationship possible?"</p>
<p>Harriman replied: Miss, your family buys groceries from the catering company every day, but you may not be willing to marry the owner of that catering company, right? However, as long as his dishes are indeed very good, I think you will definitely still be happy to be his customer, and have a pretty good relationship.</p>
<h3 id="e147">First Trip to Shanghai <a href="#e147" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c147" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">147</a></h3>
<p>-- Le Zhi</p>
<p>As someone who has just arrived in Shanghai, I will briefly describe my impressions as follows. I don't know how those who have lived here for a long time feel.</p>
<p>The general phenomenon in Shanghai is complexity, richness, disorder, and contradiction, which is elusive everywhere. This is due to a city's gradual development over a hundred years, and there are innate factors that cannot be helped. The congestion on Nanjing Road is the most obvious example. Shanghai seems to be exclusively for people with the highest level of life, who can transcend the general reality and enjoy themselves. Secondly, it is also for people with the lowest level of life, who can sacrifice any real constraints and eke out a living. The average middle class people are the most helpless. They cannot afford to live in a house, but they cannot spend the night by the roadside. They are the target of all public laws. They have to bear burdens and obey, but their welfare needs a lot of effort. To give an example, there are few or no public toilets for men and women on the streets. Even if there are, no one knows where they are. This is also difficult to ask people about. High-class people sit in cars, hotels, tea rooms, and familiar places, where they can find a solution easily, and the lowest-class people can ignore everything, but ordinary people want to solve the problem casually, but it is not allowed by etiquette and law. To be honest, this matter is not a small problem in Shanghai now. If you look at the traces on the side of the road a little bit more remote, you have to say it is a kind of humiliation. The root cause is that the distribution of public toilets for men and women is not average enough, and there are no clear instructions. In fact, the structure of public toilets may as well be as simple as possible, and the number of places must be greatly increased. You must know that many low-class families do not even have this convenience at home, and they all rely on public toilets.</p>
<p>In the past, foreigners managed the concession without considering the convenience of Chinese people. There were no street names on the house numbers, and the roads were too long. Often, when getting off the bus halfway, one had no idea where one was. There are a few things that are extremely easy to do, why not do them? The beginning and end points of each road should be clearly marked on the street signs as the east entrance or the west entrance, the south entrance or the north entrance. On too long roads, a sign should be erected in sections to indicate the house numbers from a certain intersection to a certain intersection. The tram station should indicate where the tram is waiting. Public vehicles should paint the route they pass on the body of the vehicle. (Shanghai's terrain has the Huangpu River, Suzhou River, and Racecourse as standards. You only need to draw a simplified map to symbolize the places you pass.) The times of the last bus on each route of public vehicles are different, and they should also be explained separately. In addition, we have seen the signs of postal vehicles, but there is no explanation of the time, so how can people who are not familiar with the situation know what time to wait for the postal vehicle? Things like this are inevitably convenient but cannot be completely thorough.</p>
<p>Shanghai's place names have the confusion of new intersections and old road names, plus the difference between what is said verbally and what is written on paper. They all show its complexity and disorder, so it seems that the facilities for indicating routes still need to be increased.</p>
<h3 id="e148">Hemp on the Wall <a href="#e148" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c148" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">148</a></h3>
<p>-- Jia Tianjian</p>
<p>Living upstairs, there is no inch of land to plant autumn flowers. On the low wall under the terrace, wild hemp grows short and long; How much soil is there around the roots? Watering only relies on rain and dew. Rain is uncertain, and nourishment cannot be lacking. How can it also grow? Autumn flowers take the place of spring! Fire-colored flowers bloom every year, shaking brilliantly like a haze in September. I have lived in this building for nearly eight years, and this hemp is more than last year; Last year there were only two or three sparse branches, but this year there is a dense clump growing vigorously. Passers-by point and laugh, asking in surprise, I have nothing to answer, how can I boast? If the original vitality is truly abundant, and the nourishment is not trivial, then a breath of air can connect with heaven and earth, regardless of rain, water, or soil? Who believes in this principle? Viewers only sigh in silence! The owner hates dust and can use it to block one side; The owner loves autumn colors and can draw small golden cars from the flowers. An extraordinary sight that is dazzling and pleasing to the eye, why bother going to Tao Yuanming's home with wine!</p>
<h3 id="e149">The Queen of the Netherlands <a href="#e149" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c149" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">149</a></h3>
<p>-- Chen Xiang</p>
<p>Queen Wilhelmina of the Netherlands abdicated in early September of this year. This 67-year-old lady took office on August 31, 1898, her 18th birthday, and has been in power for half a century.</p>
<p>Wilhelmina is the eleventh monarch of the House of Orange. Her father, William III, was 63 years old when she was born, and she was the only person to inherit the throne. However, her mother, Emma, was only 20 years old at the time and was William III's second wife. When William III died, Wilhelmina was only ten years old and was ruled by her mother for eight years before formally ascending the throne.</p>
<p>Wilhelmina is simple and frugal. She lives in a simple white palace on a bustling street in The Hague. This palace even has a house number like other houses - number 68. Inside, there are only stoves and no radiators. When the Queen wants to take a bath, the water has to be carried bucket by bucket temporarily. She also rides a bicycle like ordinary people, and the bicycle is usually parked on a rack near the palace gate. She also takes time to manage household affairs. Before World War II, people could often see her sitting at the window sewing.</p>
<p>The newly appointed Princess Juliana is the only daughter of the Queen and Prince Henry of Mecklenburg. She was born in 1909 and is now a 38-year-old middle-aged woman. The Queen felt that her childhood was too restricted, bleak, and lifeless, so she raised Juliana in a more normal way. She allowed her to study at schools outside the palace and play with other children. Therefore, Juliana has many friends and freely mingles with commoners without restraint. It is said that this new Dutch monarch not only inherited her mother's simple style, but will also be closer to the common people.</p>
<p>The current semester has begun, and I planned to withdraw money as agreed to cover tuition and other expenses. Unexpectedly, the bank still used the pre-war deposit repayment method, only allowing a one-time settlement, paying only a little over two corners. May I ask, twelve years ago, I deposited the price of 30 shi of white rice, but today I only receive one liter of rice, which is not enough to buy a book. Is there such a principle in the world? The government advocates frugality and rewards deposits for children's education. Parents who educate their children and save materials for the country should not allow banks to exploit and enrich themselves. In terms of the capital of various banks, what was the total value more than ten years ago? What is the current value? Even if we ignore real estate, the amount of foreign exchange recently paid by various banks to the national treasury has exceeded the value. I believe there must be many depositors in the same situation as me. I hope the government authorities will re-establish reasonable measures and order various banks to pay as agreed to maintain credit. Reader Li Shiyong</p>
<h3 id="e150">Mark Twain's Love Letter <a href="#e150" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c150" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">150</a></h3>
<p>-- Zhang Ruxian</p>
<p>The famous American writer Mark Twain can be regarded as the most diligent writer of love letters. After he and Mrs. Livy got married, they still wrote letters frequently. When he was away from home, he would send her a letter almost every day, sometimes four letters a day. Even when he was at home, he would still write to her, often putting short notes on her breakfast plate or stuffing them in her hand. The following letter was written on November 27, 1885, which was Mrs. Livy's 40th birthday and their 17th wedding anniversary. He used the morning as a metaphor for youth, and the green valleys and fields as a metaphor for the happy days of youth. Look, it's simply a beautiful poem:</p>
<p>"Dear, here we are at another milestone, far from where we started. But when we look back, there is a pleasant scenery - in our pleasant memories, everything in that distant morning is still the same, the slopes are still lush green, the fields are still full of flowers, and the mountains are still silent. We still have many companions on this journey - ah, such precious, lovely, gentle companions who inspire my ambition! They make us forget the difficulties of the journey. You and I are both heading towards the sunset, and they accompany us, holding our hands, so that our feet do not feel tired. Everyone is together, only becoming more and more loving. Everyone walks towards the flower-filled green fields ahead, the light of dusk shines behind the fields and flowers, as lovely as that gentle morning of the past."</p>
<h3 id="e151">Remembering Zhao Shuru <a href="#e151" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c151" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">151</a></h3>
<p>-- Chen Zuogao</p>
<p>I previously wrote about the anecdotes of Wu Changshuo. Thinking of Mr. Zhao Shuru of Siming, who was also proficient in epigraphy, calligraphy, and painting, the two of them shone in the art world one after the other. Some of the old words and deeds are worth passing on, so I will write them down to continue the previous discussion. Mr. Zhao's given name was Shiwang, and his courtesy name was Weichang. Later, he changed his courtesy name to Shuru. He collected two crossbow machines from the Shu Han Dynasty, Wei Wu's Jianxing era, and treasures such as Shuzhong, all of which are rare treasures. Therefore, he named his study Er Nu Jing She, and later changed his name to Er Nu Laoren. At the end of the Qing Dynasty, he was an official in Fujian, serving as the Assistant Magistrate and colleague with my father. His calligraphy was proficient in all four scripts, and his painting was excellent in feathers, flowers, grass, and insects. His horses were especially well-known. His father, Cuifu (named Youchen, a well-known calligrapher in the late Qing Dynasty, who had many famous scholars as his disciples, such as Wu Dacheng and Tan Zhonglin), once served as the Magistrate of Zhenjiang. When Mr. Zhao was only eight years old, he would paint for guests, with a calm demeanor. His Eight Horses were lifelike, embodying the beauty of "Meng Ni Min E Zhi Man Gui Xian Qie Pei." One day, Lin Ouzhai (named Shoutu, Provincial Treasurer of Hubei), went to Cuifu's banquet, saw his work, and was greatly surprised, calling him a child prodigy and marrying his daughter to him. After that, Mr. Zhao became more devoted to Lang Shining's paintings during the Qianlong period, studying the posture, demeanor, and expression of horses day and night for decades.</p>
<p>Mr. Zhao's seal carving imitated Zhao Zhiqian, and he gained the essence of it. The side inscriptions were simple and dignified, almost surpassing him. However, his whole life's energy was focused on art, and he had no time to engage in the ordering of words and sounds and giant works. In the early Republic of China, Cheng Linsheng collected a wealth of bronze vessels and artifacts from the Three Dynasties, and asked Mr. Zhao to organize them one by one and attach explanations. As a result, he made many discoveries in the comparison of similarities and differences, which can continue the work of Ruan Yuan's Ji Gu Zhai and Zhang Jin's Qing Yi Ge. It is said that although Mr. Zhao was only an engraver, he could be ranked among the epigraphers.</p>
<p>After the Xinhai Revolution, he once worked in the Jiangxi Tax Bureau and settled in Shanghai, moving his residence three times. He first rented a house on Tangshan Road. The senior calligrapher Zeng Nongran, who was living nearby at the time, often came with paintings to ask for comments. Later, he moved to West Jiaxing Road, next to a pig slaughterhouse, with a manure pier in front of the door. Strange noises were heard all day long, and the stench filled the air. People all covered their ears and noses and passed by, but Mr. Zhao lived there peacefully for seven or eight years. Before the War of Resistance, he moved to Weihaiwei Road, and Zuo Gao often went to visit him, seeing that he was tall and vigorous, holding a cigar, with smoke rising. The beard had only a dozen strands, comparable to Wu Changshuo. When carving stone seals, his arms and wrists were in the air. He often told his disciples, "Take the highest standard as your model, and you will only get the middle one." He was usually taciturn and never criticized people. Even close indoor disciples were treated with the courtesy of guests. Besides going out to watch movies and plays, he had no other hobbies, sweeping away the habits of a celebrity.</p>
<p>Looking back, since Mr. Zhao traveled as an official in Fujian, he had seen many fine stone seals and became determined to imitate them. In the catalogues of seals from the Qin and Han dynasties, he painstakingly copied every character with a different form, following the example of the Han Dynasty's classification of rhymes, with the number of characters about three times wider. After that, he wrote three or four drafts but did not finish them, so he asked his brother Julai to continue it, naming it "Ancient Seal Character Rhyme Forest." In the year of Bingyin, Mr. Luo Zhenyu from Shangyu visited Shanghai, and Mr. Zhao went to his door with the book to beg for a preface. More than two years later, the preface had not been published and was returned as it was. Later, Luo Zifu Yi also had "A Compilation of Qin and Han Characters" published. However, the manuscript of the Rhyme Forest was voluminous and had not been printed, and it is still stored in the home of the seal collector Zhang Luchang. Holding a pen to this point, I occasionally check the Two Nujing House Seal Collection on the desk, and I can't help but feel a sense of the loss of a dear friend.</p>

<h3 id="e152">Calling for Children's Education Savings - Hoping the Government Will Revise Reasonable Measures <a href="#e152" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c152" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">152</a></h3>
<p>I read the news in the Nanjing dispatch of your newspaper on September 22, "Xu Huqing and other representatives of pre-war bank depositors in the capital petitioned the Legislative Yuan for children's education savings." As one of these depositors, I have some thoughts. Twelve years ago, I saved money and food to open an account for my young son in a bank in Jiangsu Province, depositing 280 yuan of national currency for secondary school education savings. This year, it is due to expire. According to the bank's regulations, 100 yuan will be withdrawn each semester as tuition, food, and book expenses, with twelve installments for six years of secondary school. We should encourage savings. Depositors educate their children and save materials for the country. We should not allow banks to exploit and enrich themselves. In terms of the capital of various banks, what was the total value a little over ten years ago? What is the current value? Even if we ignore real estate, the amount of foreign exchange recently paid by various banks to the national treasury has exceeded the value. I believe there must be many depositors in the same situation as me. I hope the government authorities will re-establish reasonable measures and order various banks to pay as agreed to maintain credit. Reader Li Shiyong</p>
