<h3>孫科呈辭行政院長　總統勸勉繼續努力　組閣困難今將會商解決</h3>
<p>〔本報南京十九日電〕孫科內閣籌組，終以遭遇困難過多，而發生變化，十八日晚幾達於決定階段之政策·人事，十九日復生波折。孫氏受命組閣以來，自上月廿六日立院投票同意迄今，已歷廿餘日，其新閣尙未組成，孫氏主張之舉黨一致巨頭內閣，殆已不能達成目的，外傳張羣·張治中等已允入閣說，似屬言之過早。孫氏以組閣困難，漸趨消極，經向總統拜辭組閣大命，惟總統已當面請孫收回辭呈，勉以繼續努力。十九日晨總統復派張羣·吳鐵城等往勸，並與孫氏協商解決困難問題，十九日之折衝似尙未獲得具體結果。廿日中央紀念週後，將舉行中常會，就此項問題提出討論。另據接近總統人士透露如孫科堅辭，總統或將就張羣。張治中二人中考慮新行政院長人選。</p>
<p>〔合衆社南京十九日電〕權威方面十九日對合衆社稱：孫科組織戰時內閣之努力，十九日晨四遭遇新困難而受挫，如此項困難至廿日尙未解決，則孫氏可能辭職。未來之討論，將在廿日晨舉行，雖然，能否達成協議，尙在未定之中，但高級政府人仕認為極屬可能。據稱：在十九目晨之會商中，因吳鐵城堅拒出任行政院副院長而告擱淺，但孫氏希望在組閣完成後略作休養，堅持吳氏入閣。又據合衆社探悉，現任交通部長俞大維可能繼何應欽出長國防部，現國民黨海外部長劉維熾，則可能繼陳啓天出任工商部長，陳立夫業己允許入閣，担任內政部長或不兼部會之閣員，但如吳鐵城堅決不願出任副揆，陳氏亦有出任行政院副院長之可能。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕第四期美援動用之經費，約為六千萬美元，運用計劃已由經合分署擬就，送請美援運用委員會核定。此期美援中，包括糧食·棉花·肥料·油類及工業設備之訂貨，按美援項下，糧食共佔七千萬美元，一·二·三期美援糧食已動用四千萬美元以上，故第四期美援糧食部份可能為二千萬美元左右。惟鑒於教國目前之局勢，工業設備之接濟已非當務之急，經合總署可能將工業設備移增糧食部份，故第四期之美援糧食，可能多二千萬美元，此事於本月下旬，將由美援會及經合分署會商決定。</p>

<p>〔本報南京十九日電〕戒嚴法第八條條文將予修正，國防部已因應事實上之需要，呈請政院轉咨立法院，完成立法程序。據悉：戒嚴法第八條中規定，戒嚴時期，接戰地域內關於刑法上內亂罪，外患罪，妨害秩序罪，公共危險罪，偽造貨幣有價證券及文書印文各罪，殺人罪，妨害自由罪，搶奪强盜或海盜罪，恐嚇及擄人勒贛罪，毀棄損壞罪等，軍事機關得自行審判或送法院審判，國防部以值茲戡亂期間，全國各地無不潛伏奸匪，乘機擾亂秩序，刺探軍情，危害國家安全，影響軍事行動，總統雖已宣布全國戒嚴，規定縣長兼理軍法職務，但西北之大部及西南與長江以南之全部均為警戒區域，依戒嚴法之規定，縣長雖兼理司法，仍無權審判奸匪共匪，設有時種刑庭之地方，亦僅廿四處，如縣長不能立卽制裁奸匪活動，卽無法負責維持治安，為謀補救起見，該部擬請修正戒嚴法第八條，擴大警戒地域內軍法管轄範圍，使軍法本身有權審判奸匪共匪，再由國防部將此權賦予兼理軍法職務之縣長，俾遏制後方匪患，爭取戡亂勝利。</p>

<h3>社論　美果將加緊扶日乎？</h3>
<p>美國國務院於十七日宣佈，美國對於安定日本經濟，巳有新的訓令送達盟軍總帥麥克阿瑟，指令日本政府實施有效的穩定級濟計劃，藉以保睡經濟復興之持續以及美國資金的充分利用。日本首相吉田聞訊之後，喜出望外，立即向法國新聞社記者表示滿意，一般日本人民也莫不喜形於色，不免得憲忘形，認為這是日本前途的一種光明。我們雖不抱着「吃不著葡萄，便說葡萄是酸的」的卑鄙心理，但是美國舍本逐未採取「扶日防共」的下策，以及日本的投機取巧一味討好美國，我們以遠大的眼光來觀察，認為總非遠東和平之福。我們於此，不能不指出美國在遠東勢將走入歧途。</p>
<p>日本為利用「美援」復與經濟起見，於本年五月間，早就擬就一項「經濟復興五年計劃」，由經濟復興計劃會議公佈後，美國輿論界立即表示支持，陸軍次長屈拉勃亦曾有明朗的表示。他說：「日本巳開始經濟復興，但任重道遠，非一蹴可幾。……該計劃欲求成功，日本全國必須較戰前更要節衣縮食。」接着麥帥又於七月間指令日本政府，力促其實行八項計劃：（一）嚴格節省支出及增加政府稅收，以便早日完成眞正平衡的預算；（二）加速並加强收稅計劃，對逃避納稅的人保證予以迅速的普遍的有力的刑事控訴；（三）嚴格限制貸款，儘以有助於日本經濟復興的計劃為限；（四）擬定完成工資安定的有效計劃；（五）加强並於必要時擴充現有物價管制計劃的範圍；（六）改善對外貿易的管制工作，並加緊現有的外匯管制，務使此等措施能移交輿日本各機關執行；（七）增加一切重要本國原料及製成品的產量；（八）改進糧食搜集計劃的效能。</p>
<p>但是五六個月以來，因為日本通貨的彫賬，物價工資的不安定，致使這八項計劃，均未能實現。美國國務院十七日的新訓令，又將舊事重提，督促日本朝野切實履行。不過凡是洞悉日本經濟內情的人，無不明瞭，若不能防止通貨膨脹，而欲求日本經濟的復興，無異於緣本求魚，此路決不能走通的，但在今日，美國何以如此關切日本的經濟復興？又何以如此急切盼望日本的經濟復興？這兩個問題，實在值得我們的注意，值得我們的研究。</p>
<p>據合社華府十八日電稱：美國正要把日本建立成為她在太平洋上的反共防綫之一大堡壘。國務院於十七日宣佈的穩定日本經濟訓令，實與美國支持日本的新政策，不謀而合。從這個電訊裏，我們不難看出美國在遠東的動向，率直地說，在美國當局的眼中看來，中國的局勢巳不能挽救，因此乃將其在亞洲反共防蘇的重心從「援華」移到「扶日」了。換言之，美國的援華實際將等於半路上拔去短梯，掉頭不顧，而將大戰中共患難中的盟友遺棄，反而去哄那大戰中的敵人了！美國最近對於遠東的一舉一動，在明眼人看來，一望而知。允其是日本人投機取巧，故意表示對於中國局勢的關切，對美暗示中國局勢的惡化足以影響及於日本在遠東的地位，敎美國對於日本不能不立即予以全力的援助。美國十七日頒佈的新訓令，就含有這種用意，故在日本人看來，眞可謂「如願以償」，無怪乎戰敗的日本人都作購踷滿志的歡笑了。</p>
<p>惟美國「扶日防共」的問題，在我們看萊，不是扶植不扶植日本，而是扶植了日本能不能防共的問題。凡是熟悉亞洲地理的學者，無不重視地理因素對於軍事外交的決定性·我們假定美蘇衝突不可避免，一旦不幸而爆發，美國僅能以日本為進攻大陸的據點，不問其海空軍的實力如何强大，都是根難有勝利的把握。美國軍事戰略家。對於此點，最近發表意見，莫不異口同聲地指出，就是負管制日本之資的麥克阿瑟元帥也洞若觀火，以為中國若被共黨控制，整個亞洲都將不免，日本地位勢必削弱，將處於大陸雙鉗之中，賢明如美國的外交當局，怎能運這一層起碼的常識也不够呢？</p>
<p>要之，美國如欲放棄其反共防蘇的杜魯門主義，則不如索性不要硬着頭皮領導，與蘇聯再作冷戰，否則對於中國在遠東地位的重要性，決不客忽視的。換言之，美國如若放棄「援華」的康莊大道不走。而欲走「扶日」的羊腸小徑，則無異於舍本逐末，美國在未來的世界變局中，必致自食其惡果，後悔莫及。所以我們在今日，仍願本戰時盟友之義，為世界和平計，不能不「美果將加緊扶日乎？」詢諸美國朝野，而希望他們訴之於良知與遠見。</p>

<h3>萍煤的增產和改進</h3>
<p>— 本報記者　劉藻</p>
<p>〔本報南昌十八日航訊〕贛西煤礦局所主辦的萍鄕安源與髙坑煤產，目前是負荷着重大任務，它不但要供給浙贛，粵漢，以及長沙南昌等鐵路與電廠工廠的煤斤，就是京滬的民用與平漢路的動力，亦均有一部份要仰給于萍煤，所以現在贛西煤礦局是在儘最大的努力，增加生產，改良煤質，以期完滿渡過目前的難關。</p>
<p>他們在努力增產聲中，把一部份希望寄託在美援，但是，事實告訴我們，美援一直到現在，還是個「美景」，該廠可能獲得的美援，原來是美金三百萬元，現在又加發一百萬美元，正由資委會與美商皮爾司公司洽訂購買器材契約中。</p>
<p>萍煤當局目前雖然亦不能例外地在過窮日子，但是，他們仍在不斷地以「自力更生」的方法，推進增產工程，據悉：髙坑第一，二兩號直井，在十一月中旬均已鑿至預定深度，現正從事架樑及鑲砌工作，二號直井，在十月中旬曾遇煤層，厚約一點五公尺，頗有開採價值，俟鑲砌竣工時，卽在該井一九〇公尺處開一平巷，準備產煤，在直井未產煤前，為適應目前需要，正加强淺部採煤工程，並預定在王家源張公塘兩地開鑿新井，預定於明年一月間動工。</p>
<p>泉江堰的電廠工程，第一部一，〇〇〇KW發電機，在今年大暑天日夜趕工中，已於十一月廿日開始供電，解決了萍煤電力不足的問題。第二部一，〇〇〇KW發電機，正在趕裝，原存在上海的二，〇〇〇KW發電機，亦由浙贛路裝運赴萍，祗要這三部發電機趕裝好，完成四，KW發電的工程，就能使萍煤由人工開探而進入機械化階段，成為江南唯一的機械開採的礦廠。</p>
<p>加强運輸，應該與增產計劃配合而行，目前該礦已築有由髙坑到泉江堰與浙贛路啣接的泉髙支綫，將高坑一井三井產煤，就近運至白馬廟站，裝車外運。但是，王家源四井五井及安源各井產煤，均須以肩挑或手車運至車站，非但運費髙昂，亦且多耗時日，礦局現決定在王家源與白馬廟間架設髙架索道，該項工程所需器材，均巳備妥，自十月中旬開工，沿綫樹本均己砍伐，現正趕鑄鐵架，並決定在安源萍鄉間修建輕便鐵路，以利運輸。</p>
<p>萍煤，原來是有好的信譽，可惜一般土井的開採者與煤商，祗知圖謀一時僥倖的所收，將擾良的煤質滲和泥石，不便燃燒，减低火力，自毀曩昔的信譽，現在贛西煤礦局力謀提髙萍煤的煤質，凡屬該礦區產煤，除以人工加以選洗外，並裝設洗煤機器，以增加洗量，該礦並設有化騐室，各井產煤均隨時加以化騐分析，這是對於煤質的鑑別改進上，至有補益，亦是華中各煤磯中一個創舉。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕本市各界追悼黃百韜將軍大會，並追悼故四十四師師長劉聲鶴將軍大會，昨晨十時於細雨濛濛中同時在天蟾舞台舉行。本市黨政軍機關首長及各團體學校代表三千餘人均到塲參加。黃將軍遺屬公子效先·振先·敬先·紹先，女述明·述文。述苓亦身穿縞服到會，泣不成聲。天蟾門首髙搭素色牌樓一座，入口處並設有義賣紀念花處，售款補助遺屬。會塲正中懸黃將軍遺像，上置總統親題「氣壯山河」橫關，周圍滿列花圈，兩壁遍懸各方致送之輓聯，顧祝同輓「「百戰英名齊虎豹，千秋正氣壯山河」，吳市長輓「誓死保名城，百戰忠魂歸上界；捐生完大節，千伙正氣護中華」。潘議長輓「正氣可　山，挽救國族危亡，何惜一死；英靈酬裏革，留取光榮勛烈，永著千秋一，會塲空氣肅穆莊壯嚴。</p>
<p>足資全國軍民楷模</p>
<p>大會公推吳國　·潘公展·方治·杜月笙·徐寄廎·魏汝霖等十四人為主席團，並由吳巾長任總主席。追悼儀式於哀樂聲中開始後，全體向黃將軍遺像行三鞠躬禮，繼由吳市長向靈前恭獻花圈，並致悼詞謂：此次黃。劉二將軍壯烈殉國，殺身成仁，其犧牲精神實值得我們效法，並足供全國軍民資為楷模。渠並稱方主委前赴前綫慰勞時，每提及黃將軍之忠貞不屈，所有將士無不感泣，可見黃將軍昭垂之典型及精神感人之深。吳市長末引岳武穆名句「欲天下太平，須文官不要錢，武官不怕死」謂：今日局勢較諸當年金兵南下，有過而無不及，前方將士及後方人民實應澈底覺悟，以黃將軍作為自勉互勉，則勦匪戡亂之大業，必可於最短期內完成。</p>
<p>相對泣下全塲感動</p>
<p>繼由黃將軍生前友好兪性初報告黃司令官一生事略，六十七師姚副師長報告劉師長事略。當報告時一〇八師師長李世鏡亦扶病乘手推車由衛兵扶掖蒞會，李師長原係黃將軍之廿五軍部屬，嗣改隸兵團後，在碾莊作戰負傷，轉滬療養，渠於離開前綫前尙曾與黃司令官最後互通電話，昨渠蒞漩會時足傷未癒，穿棉軍服，精神極佳，惟與黃將軍遺屬見面後，頓憶舊日長官，相對泣下，全塲覩狀，深受感動，均為之揮淚不止。吳市長特臨時動議對此民族英雄致敬，全體當卽肅然起立，在熱烈之掌聲中行鞠躬敬禮。</p>
<p>澈悟反省共同奮起</p>
<p>嗣再由潘議長致詞，略稱：自黃劉二將軍成江消息傳來，識與不識，均感動至深。黃將軍所部勝利後曾在滬駐防，繼調蘇北，其軍紀嚴明，上海市民當所熟知。似黃將軍之模範軍人，非特不怕死，而且不愛錢，試問死且不懼，如何還會愛錢？換言之，正因不愛錢，所以纔能不怕死，怕死的人都是貪財，今日局面之形成，實在就由於怕死的官，貪財的官太多，倘前後方官員俱能效法黃將軍之操守，匪勢焉得猖獗？中國亦決不會亡。潘氏並引述黃將軍之遺書中，有謂上海是罪惡淵藪，誡其長公子應有志氣，有抱負，不受惡劣環境之影響。渠指出此語足為每一上海市民之箴銘，大家應知所警惕，澈悟反省，在此艱危局面下，尤須努力擺脫聲色之誘惑，並希望卽以今日此會為起點，繼黃·劉二將軍之後，共同奮起，貢獻一切力量，以保衛國族。</p>
<p>忠精自勵繼續努力</p>
<p>方治致詞略謂：本人最近曾受本市各界之託，兩次赴前綫慰勞剿匪將士，今天願以慰勞團代表的身份，首先應該向黃劉兩將軍在天之靈表示最大的敬慰之意。黃劉兩將軍之死，轟轟烈烈，全國悲悼，現在兩將軍之身軀雖死，但他們的精忠報國的精神，將永留於人心，與中華民族的生命同悠久。所以我們儘可不必為兩將軍的殉國而傷心，而更應忠精自勵，以兩將軍為法，繼續為剿匪而努力。</p>
<p>次由水祥雲，龍冠軍等相繼致詞。最後吳市長代表大會及全國慰勞總會，向黃將軍遺屬致送賻金及慰恤金，當由黃公子效先收受，大會至十二時許結束。</p>
<p>劉將軍事略</p>
<p>茲附劉聲鶴將軍事略如後：劉師長聲鶴，半壽齡，籍隸湖北沔陽，畢業於軍校第七期步科，歷任排連營團長·副師長·旅長·師長等職，剿匪抗戰，無役不從，先後負傷凡六次，未嘗一日脫離戎間。此次參加徐東會戰，初則於新安鎭地區，率部阻擊自郯城南下之匪，繼則隨軍於運河東岸，力抗自邳縣南下與自窰灣北上夾擊之匪，掩護第七兵團全部搶渡運河鐵橋，均能達成任務，終乃以不足一團之衆，於曾八集陷匪十倍以上之圍攻，劉師長率部浴血苦戰，反復衝殺，惜以官兵傷亡殆盡，彈罄援絕，陣地被匪突破，乃發出最後一電：「聲上有魯母，下有弱妻幼女，家道淸貧，請軍長妥為照料，職當以革命軍人不成功卽成仁之決心，與陣地共存亡，以報効國家與領袖」等語。旋搜集麥草，堆置園中，上覆門板，命其軍械員於其死後焚毀滅跡，然後高呼中華民國萬歲，總統萬歲，卽舉槍自戕，彈中腦穴殞命，此十一月十一日十四時之事也。據劉將軍衛士郭慶生歸稱：當劉將軍自戕時，彼曾奪槍力阻，將軍怒目斥之曰：「汝曾乃欲余為匪俘耶？」幷以足擊之踣地，遂不及阻云。鳴呼劃將軍之忠烈，實足以動天地泣鬼神，而風勵末世。惟劉將軍上有七五髙齡之老母，下有弱妻及髫齡幼女二人，身後蕭條，何以為計？幷聞劉夫人現住蘇州鐵瓶巷七號，體質原弱，近因劉將軍噩耗，旬日未進飲食，致數月之遺腹子，忽告流產，情益悽切，刻已由周志道·戴堅·黃翔·許午言。張緒滋諸將軍，聯名呈請層峯轉報政府，以將軍殉國事蹟，宣付史館，幷予國葬、從優撫卹，以慰英靈。</p>

<h3>「高等難民」心目中　第一個「據點」　衡陽意外的熱鬧</h3>
<p>— 本報特派員　黃潮如</p>
<p>〔本報長沙十六日快訊〕衡陽，這座寂寂無閃的小城，當抗戰期間由於地理上納關係，一躍而成大後方的重鎭，商塲繁榮，人口捕病，均極一時之盛。等到抗戰末期，四十七天的衡陽保衛戰，更是聞名實字。然而這個戰時興起的都市，也不幸就在這次的保衛戰中全部毀滅了。</p>
<p>勝利之初，衡陽沒有一間完整的房屋，到處斷頃頹壁，荒草憂烟。接着是湘南大荒，衡陽一變又成了饑民城。經過這接二連三的災難、衡陽始終在奄奄一息中生存下去。到現在，除掉南北中山路的正街也有了霓虹燈和散着靡靡之音的播音，入晚行人擁擠，頗有點都市氣息外，其他地方還與勝利時相差不多遠。要想恢復戰時那付景象，大家都有些做夢似的。</p>
<p>貴客光臨　暫看風色</p>
<p>然而，由於蚱宿戰事的緊張，京·滬各地的關人大亨們爭向南方「逃難」，衡陽又意外地熱閙起來了。當然，闊人大亨們的「逃難」地點不會是衡陽，最關的當然是美國，其次是港·台，再次是廣州等地，可是，大家都知道，去美國非一般人的能力所及，就是港·合·穗的物價也頗不易担負，不少跑到香港又打轉的「難民」，誰不搖頭嘆息，「港穗雖好，不可久留」。因此也算是「安全區」的衡陽，被這批貴客光顯了，他們把衡陽作為「避難」的第一個據點，暫時躲在這裏看看風色，從衡陽到港·穗·到桂林，入黔滇，都很方便，加以戰時京滬一帶曾在衡陽住過多年的人，對於衡陽自然有幾分親切感，這時大家都在「逃難」又何樂不作一番舊地重遊？由此，衡陽在此一個月中，竟漸漸熱鬧起來，一切都欣欣向榮了。</p>
<p>謠言風熾　神經緊張</p>
<p>最近顯出衡陽恢復戰時熱鬧景象的地方，要首推衡陽火車東站，粵漢路上一列列長串的車箱上，「沙丁魚」似的堆着旅客，他們固然不少過此而去廣州，但到此下車而轉桂林的也很多，不僅是旅客，其中還有不少政府官員，機關的公文公物，還有公務員的官眷，衡陽站上擁塞起來了。當這異常的象景初展開時，衡陽市民不免有些旣喜且憂，疑慮滋生，街頭的謠言特別多，大家的神經却有些緊張和過敏，無事生事的閙個不休，頗有「山雨欲來」的情勢。不僅市民如此，連政府官員和新聞記者也都如此。</p>
<p>這里特地報導兩個足解人頤的小插曲：</p>
<p>衡陽上空　四機眞象</p>
<p>一天中午時分，衡陽上空發現運輸機四架，略作盤旋後，隨即降落機塲。在往日，衝陽雖也日有飛機起落，但却從未見如是日之同時四架降臨，於是機塲地下人員靈機一動，以為必係中樞要員南來無疑，乃急馳往迎迓，及打開窗門一看，徒見每機箱內，各裝最新式小型汽車七輛及箱篋等物，始廢然而退。有新聞記者往探消息者，得聞眞象後，亦不禁大失所望，相視啞然。聞該四機係過衡轉穗，降落加油，一說為中航客機，但中航旋又公開否認</p>
<p>眷屬行李　誤為要員</p>
<p>同日晚十一時左右，市府和各報館忽接獲情報，謂李副總統專車過衡。市政首長及各報記者聞訊，那敢放過機會，於是冒着夜寒，過江相迎。到了車站，新聞記者當即展開突擊，分頭探聽李副總統下落，結果「專車」上沒有副總統，原來是桂籍要人的眷屬和行李，如夏威。李品仙及留京立委等眷屬，人數約有四百餘，聲個列車均為彼等所佔，計頭等車二節，二等車四節，行李車五節，其中聞某要人行李，即達四百件之多，幾占車箱一個。此時已夜蘭人靜，往迎者只好意興索然而返。</p>
<p>幻想多端　現實更慘</p>
<p>今日衡陽就在這神經緊張和過敏的緊　中，大家都幻想着不久又有一個非常的局而展開，他們計劉如何把握住這個局面，編織着一個未來底美麗的生活畫面，在美麗的想像尙未編織完成，　到的苦痛的現實生活却變本加厲，因為這幾天衡陽的地皮，房子，貨物，巳在飛速的上漲，雖然比較港。穗還是便宜得很多。</p>
<h3>南通經濟心臓　大生紗廠創立五十週年</h3>
<p>— 本報記者　叢永樞</p>
<p>〔南通十四日快訊〕大生紗廠在南通，有他特殊的歷史，他不僅是南通的一個工廠而已，南通靠了他才獲得了繁榮。該廠創設於淸光緒廿四年，卽公元一八九九年，到今年剛好整整五十週年。記者於該廠五十週年的前夕去參觀，更有重大的意義。</p>
<p>大生紗廠設於南通縣城西北約十五華里的唐閘鎭，從這裏去蘇北最大的吞吐港夭生港約十里路。唐閘是通榆公路南端的一儸大鎭，附近一帶便是著名</p>
<p>通棉產區</p>
<p>東台，大中集一帶的細絨花，以及通榆公路沿綫的棉花都可很便利的運達這裏。在往年，蘇北平靖，大卡車馱着一包一包的棉花，從通榆公路北段運過來，一大船一大船的棉花運過來，大生紗廠是不愁沒有原料的。可惜這幾年來，鄕區不靖，像大中集的細絨，就很難南來，收購頗為費事。執行經管政策的限價時期，正是棉花登塲之際，竟連一担棉花也難買到，廠方幾乎停工，幸虧購有一批印棉，運來暫時接濟，但為了維持起見，曾經改開三日班，做三天，歇三天。最近總算還好，收點棉花還可維持。</p>
<p>大生紡織</p>
<p>公司有四個廠，在唐閘的叫大生一廠，此外，在南通城南有大生八廠，又叫大生制廠。在海門境內有大生三廠，那地方就因廠而得名，便叫三廠。在崇明的久隆鎭，還有大生二廠。一廠創立最早，占地一百餘畝，分第一·第二兩工塲，原有紗錠九萬二千五百枚，淪陷期間遭日人毀壞，現在僅能開七萬三千錠。布機原有六百台，現使用的僅三分之二，計匹百台。每天如果正常生產的話，能出紗一百三十件，布六百疋。全廠擁有職員一百五十餘人，職工五千八百多人，其中女工要占到五分之三以上。大部份工人都住在唐閘鎭和附近的鄕里，廠方對工人的福利事業相當注意：設有工人識字班，藝徒訓練班，職工診所，職工合作社，職工書報室，職工運動塲，職工娛樂室，對於職工子弟的敎育，設有子弟學校。其他如職工死亡的撫卹，女工生產的津貼，貧苦工人的賑濟，都訂有優侍條例。</p>
<p>大生紗廠是南通經濟上的一顆心臟。只要他動了，南通的農，工，商各業也便靈活，南通是靠了他而獲得繁榮的。</p>
<p>五十年來，大生紗廠一直撑持住南通的</p>
<p>各種事業：</p>
<p>如南通學院和該院的附屬醫院，通州師範，女子師範，盲啞學校等敎育事業，養老院，育嬰堂，殘廢院等慈善事業，都依靠着該紗的支援。而南通地方財政經濟的周轉，多少也靠大生紗廠而獲得靈活，所以說，大生紗廠在南通，是有他特殊的關係，不同於其他地方的工廠。他建立於南通，繁榮了南通，拿地方的產業，作地方的建設，這是一個很好的榜樣。</p>
<p>大生紗廠為了紀念這富有歷史意義的五十週年，特在該廠附近創設大生紀念小學，校舍已在與建中，伺時並於該廠人事科辦公室前，豎立張嗇公銅像及紀念碑，藉以追念先賢，並於本月十八日舉行了一個熱烈的紀念儀式，同伸慶祝與激勵之意。</p>

<h3>榆路上　壞人種惡果　本報記者金弢</h3>
<p>〔本報北平十日航訊〕瀋榆路是那樣的漫長，心是那樣的火急，共匪又是那樣的鬼計多端，但是人們無論如何也要西去，也要回家，匪方則沿途像篩子似的向下篩，篩留軍人，篩留他們認為是犯罪的人，一段一段路的篩，把年富力强的官兵（留下，尤其是東北人，到綏中近山海關時，被扣，解回，編隊，離開公路，避去人們的耳目，經由小道，押解回瀋，或哈爾濱，是不能「解放」回來了。</p>
<p>過去，東北國軍陣營裏，精明自愛的人當然很多，但胡作非為的也正大有人在，這些壞的官兵，各省籍的都有，走在路上，我聽到鄕農的哀怨傾訴，××打人，駡人，抓鷄，打猪，沒規章的要草料，糧食，使善良的老百姓，吃盡苦頭，諜報人員的所做所為，更叫老百姓咬牙切齒。</p>
<p>那些壞人，眞是國家最大的罪人，他們把老百姓弄得眼淚往肚子裏流，弄得老百姓無可奈何，弄得老百姓轉變了傾向，弄得軍人和老百姓之間，築起了一道髙牆，挖下了一條鴻溝，不合作，少情報，給整個國軍一個致命打擊。</p>
<p>此外，有些軍人都成了家，娶了老婆，班長，排長，連長，甚至有些兵，都娶妻生子，處處以家為念，事事以家為先，先私後公，分了精力，毀了幹勁，家庭累贅，家庭負担，更使他們做生意，結果影響了全局。</p>
<p>這次西來的軍人中，有好多的家眷跟着走，千辛萬苦，也有的搭鄕農拉座的大車，絡繹於途，在繞陽河遇到幾隊「入路」，正在行軍，他們對於這些官兵嘲笑，譏諷，賣弄，有好多對坐車的軍人眷屬在喊：「看官娘子！」「你們怎打垮的！」</p>
<p>匪軍不娶太太嗎？是的，不娶，他們有過份的限制，不但班，排，連長不能娶太太，營長也不能娶，到了國長階級纔能娶。娶的是訓練好的太太，是黨意識和信仰堅定的女工作人員。其餘的人呢？或者是等待着將來，或者有其他的出路</p>
<p>匪軍不要糧嗎？不要草嗎？要，要的並不少。瀋陽剛到手，他們就開始向鄕人要草，要糧，十畝地，要立刻交出一百五十手糧，若干斤草。有的地方還要多·在北鎭，閭陽驛，看到了一輛接着一輛的繳糧大車，老百姓的心理，還有「誰當皇帝給誰拿貢」。據說：「八路軍要糧，要草，要車，由農會負責，有一定的數目，沒有人人要糧，人人要草。人人要車，或者竟至賣了再要，少數人下了腰包，官家得不到好處的毛病。」</p>
<p>我在路上，看到匪將近一個縱隊的行軍，每個人除了一枝槍或者沒槍外，幾乎是再沒有什麽了。輕裝，快走，排，連，營長，都走在一起。「加油」，「到××吃飯」，有時是一陣掌聲，有時是在唱短小輕快的歌，效果是很大的。</p>
<p>匪軍來自民間，多半沒脫鄕農氣息，匪施以嚴格的訓練，只有縱的控制，沒有橫的連繫，只知賣命，只能考慮的向前衝，像洪水，像瘋狂，每個人只有這一條路！</p>

<h3>二批輸日台糖　月內運銷完竣</h3>
<p>台灣糖業公司運銷日本之第二批合糖共計二萬噸，先後巳分兩艘巨輪述一萬七千噸，尙餘三千噸，裝船工作卽可完竣，本月內可全部運完。第三批運銷日本台糖，將自明年二三月間開始啓運。據該公司負責人表示，日本各大都市現已成為我國台糖之固定外銷市塲云。</p>
<p>又該公司本年度所種植之甘蔗，現巳完全長成，定自明年元且以後開始製糖，準備製糖之糖廠共有三十七個，其中三十五個製砂糖，二個製赤糖，估計今年所種之甘蔗，可製成四十萬噸之台糖。</p>
<h3>台糖產量增加　本年達四十五萬噸</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕台糖公司本年度之產糖量，原定估計為四十萬噸，茲以本年合地氣候較往年為佳，風災亦少，致蔗田均告豐收，故預計本年度之產糖量，可增加至四十五萬噸。</p>
<p>以目前情形而論，國內銷塲無形轉趨狹窄，故公司當局，今後將致力於爭取外銷市塲。</p>
<p>按目前食糖世界市價，以九十六度生糖為準，約合紐約市價每磅五分，（包括關稅等在內）。照此市價核算，台糖之產最每年須達六十萬噸以上，外銷方能够本。為達成該一外銷水準計，公司當局唯有埋頭努力於增產之一途。而增產前途唯一之空碍，厥為週轉資金之缺乏。</p>
<p>例如以本年度之產糖而言，姑以四十萬噸為準，蔗農在分糖辦法下應攤得二十萬噸，作為植蔗之酬報。惟蔗農去年分糖結果，取得實物後以適值糖價低落，反形吃虧，故本年度將請公司改按食糖市價，折發現金。而此二十萬噸之食糖，所需之資金巳達五千億台幣，數額龐大，卽以台省銀行資力之雄厚，其最髙發行額亦不過為九二〇億台幣。對此鉅額資金之需求，亦感愛莫能助。為維護蔗農利益，提髙蔗農植蔗興趣，該項資金必須籌措足額，方能維繫台糖明年之產量於不隊。茲聞中央銀行及各關係當局，對該公司需要週轉資金之迫切，頗表同情，允予合力設法，予以解決云。</p>
<h3>捲菸工業銷沉</h3>
<p>上海市工業會技術委員會息：上海區捲菸工業計有九十五家工廠，職工三萬五千餘人，每月出產各種捲菸共約十二萬箱、佔全國生產總量百分之五十左右。</p>
<p>近以烽火蔓延，戰區日見廣袤，銷路乃益狹隘，同時稅收太重，工資髙漲，影響成本殊鉅，而資金運用不足時，須髙利貸款，以應付必要開支，工廠被迫停工者，達三分之一以上，直接影響職工生計，間接减少國家稅收，實已面臨最危險之絕境，若當局再不貼放低利貸以資救濟，則不但該業前途將不堪設想，卽國家稅收之影響亦極大也云。</p>
<h3>銀鐵業今結息　各行莊休假一天</h3>
<p>銀錢業今日循例辦理下半年度結息事宜，各行莊對外休假一天，對內則加緊結算下半年度帳務。又紗布等各業市塲，因今日票據交換停頓，亦均休業一天云。</p>
<h3>上月出口數量</h3>
<p>較十月份减少絲鬃尤甚</p>
<p>工商部上海商品檢騐局十一月份檢騐合格出口商品數字較十月份减少，尤以生絲猪鬃為甚。至荳類較十月份略有增加，詳細數字如次：</p>

<h3>Sun Ke Resigns as Premier; President Urges Continued Efforts; Cabinet Formation Difficulties to be Resolved Through Consultation Today</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 19th] Sun Ke's cabinet formation has changed due to encountering too many difficulties. Policies and personnel matters which were nearing finalization on the evening of the 18th were again disrupted on the 19th. Since being appointed to form a cabinet, from the Legislative Yuan's approval vote on the 26th of last month until now, more than 20 days have passed, yet his new cabinet has not been formed. Sun's advocated all-party unity of top leaders cabinet has likely failed to achieve its purpose. External rumors that Zhang Qun, Zhang Zhizhong, and others have agreed to join the cabinet appear to be premature. Sun, due to the difficulties in forming a cabinet, has become increasingly passive and has submitted his resignation from the premiership to the President. However, the President has personally asked Sun to withdraw his resignation and encouraged him to continue his efforts. On the morning of the 19th, the President again dispatched Zhang Qun, Wu Tiecheng, and others to persuade him and to consult with Sun on resolving the difficult problems. The negotiations on the 19th do not seem to have yielded any concrete results. A Central Standing Committee meeting will be held after the Central Memorial Week on the 20th to discuss this matter. According to sources close to the President, if Sun Ke insists on resigning, the President may consider Zhang Qun or Zhang Zhizhong as candidates for the new Premier.</p>
<p>[United Press, Nanjing Dispatch, 19th] Authoritative sources told the United Press on the 19th that Sun Ke's efforts to organize a wartime cabinet suffered new setbacks on the morning of the 19th. If these difficulties are not resolved by the 20th, Sun may resign. Future discussions will be held on the morning of the 20th, although it is uncertain whether an agreement can be reached, senior government officials believe it is highly possible. It is said that the discussions on the morning of the 19th were stalled because Wu Tiecheng firmly refused to serve as Deputy Premier. However, Sun hopes to take a short rest after the cabinet is formed and insists on Wu joining the cabinet. According to United Press sources, the current Minister of Communications Yu Dawei may succeed He Yingqin as Minister of National Defense, while the current Minister of Overseas Affairs of the Kuomintang, Liu Wei-zhi, may succeed Chen Qitian as Minister of Industry and Commerce. Chen Lifu has already agreed to join the cabinet, serving as Minister of Interior or a non-departmental cabinet member. However, if Wu Tiecheng firmly refuses to serve as Deputy Premier, Chen may also become a candidate for Deputy Premier.</p>

<p>[Our Dispatch] The funds to be used for the fourth phase of US aid are approximately US$60 million. The implementation plan has been drafted by the ECA branch and submitted to the US Aid Utilization Committee for approval.

<h3>30th Legislative Yuan Meeting to be Held on the First of Next Month</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing Dispatch, 19th] The 30th meeting of the second session of the Legislative Yuan is scheduled to be held at 9:00 AM on the first of the month at the National Assembly Hall.</p>
<h3>Martial Law to be Amended: Ministry of National Defense Submits to Executive Yuan to Complete Legislative Process, Expanding the Scope of Military Jurisdiction in Alert Areas</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 19th] Article 8 of the Martial Law is to be amended. The Ministry of National Defense, in response to actual needs, has submitted a request to the Executive Yuan to forward it to the Legislative Yuan to complete the legislative process. It is understood that Article 8 of the Martial Law stipulates that during martial law, within combat zones, regarding crimes of internal rebellion, treason, offenses against public order, public endangerment, forgery of currency, valuable securities, and documents and seals, murder, offenses against freedom, robbery, piracy, intimidation, kidnapping for ransom, and destruction of property, military organs may conduct their own trials or send them to court for trial. The Ministry of National Defense believes that during this period of suppression of rebellion, traitors and bandits are lurking everywhere in the country, taking the opportunity to disrupt order, spy on military intelligence, endanger national security, and affect military operations. Although the President has announced martial law throughout the country and stipulated that county magistrates concurrently hold the position of military judge, most of the Northwest and all of the Southwest and South of the Yangtze River are alert areas. According to the provisions of the Martial Law, although county magistrates concurrently hold judicial positions, they still have no authority to try traitors and communist bandits. There are only 24 locations with special criminal tribunals. If county magistrates cannot immediately suppress the activities of traitors and bandits, they cannot be responsible for maintaining public order. To remedy this, the Ministry plans to amend Article 8 of the Martial Law to expand the scope of military jurisdiction within alert areas, so that the military law itself has the power to try traitors and communist bandits. The Ministry of National Defense will then grant this power to county magistrates concurrently holding military law positions, in order to curb banditry in the rear and strive for victory in suppressing the rebellion.</p>

<h3>Editorial: Will the US Intensify its Support for Japan?</h3>
<p>On the 17th, the US State Department announced that new instructions regarding stabilizing the Japanese economy had been sent to Supreme Commander MacArthur, instructing the Japanese government to implement effective economic stabilization plans to ensure the continued economic recovery and the full utilization of US funds. Upon hearing the news, Japanese Prime Minister Yoshida was overjoyed and immediately expressed his satisfaction to the Agence France-Presse reporter. The general Japanese population was also visibly pleased, inevitably becoming complacent, believing this to be a sign of a bright future for Japan. While we do not hold the base mentality of "sour grapes," we believe that the US's misguided policy of "supporting Japan to contain communism" and Japan's opportunistic attempts to please the US do not bode well for peace in the Far East in the long run. We must point out that the US is heading down a wrong path in the Far East.</p>
<p>In order to use "US aid" to revive its economy, Japan had already drafted a "Five-Year Economic Reconstruction Plan" in May of this year. After the plan was announced by the Economic Reconstruction Planning Conference, American public opinion immediately expressed support, and Under Secretary of the Army Draper also made a clear statement, saying, "Japan has begun economic recovery, but the task is arduous and cannot be accomplished overnight… To ensure the success of this plan, the entire Japanese nation must be even more frugal than before the war." Subsequently, in July, MacArthur instructed the Japanese government to vigorously implement eight plans: (1) Strictly conserve expenditures and increase government tax revenues to achieve a truly balanced budget as soon as possible; (2) Accelerate and strengthen the tax collection plan, ensuring swift, widespread, and forceful criminal prosecution for those who evade taxes; (3) Strictly limit loans, restricting them to projects that contribute to Japan's economic recovery; (4) Develop an effective plan to stabilize wages; (5) Strengthen and, if necessary, expand the scope of existing price control plans; (6) Improve the management of foreign trade and tighten existing foreign exchange controls, ensuring that these measures can be transferred to Japanese agencies for implementation; (7) Increase the production of all important domestic raw materials and finished goods; (8) Improve the effectiveness of the food collection plan.</p>
<p>However, for the past five or six months, due to the deflation of Japanese currency and the instability of prices and wages, these eight plans have failed to be implemented. The US State Department's new instructions on the 17th reiterated the old issues and urged the Japanese government to earnestly fulfill them. However, anyone who understands the inner workings of the Japanese economy knows that without preventing currency inflation, seeking Japan's economic recovery is like trying to catch fish by climbing a tree. This path is definitely not feasible. But why is the US so concerned about Japan's economic recovery today? And why is it so eager to see Japan's economic recovery? These two questions are really worth our attention and research.</p>
<p>According to a Washington dispatch from the Associated Press on the 18th, the United States is trying to build Japan into a major fortress as part of its anti-communist defense line in the Pacific. The State Department's instructions on stabilizing the Japanese economy, announced on the 17th, coincide with the new US policy of supporting Japan. From this telegram, we can easily see the US's direction in the Far East. To put it bluntly, in the eyes of the US authorities, the situation in China is beyond saving. Therefore, it is shifting the focus of its anti-communist and anti-Soviet efforts in Asia from "aid to China" to "supporting Japan." In other words, US aid to China will actually be like removing a short ladder halfway, turning a blind eye, abandoning its ally in the war against a common enemy, and instead coaxing the enemy in the war! To discerning observers, every move the US has made recently in the Far East is obvious. It is permissible for the Japanese to take advantage of the situation and deliberately express concern about the situation in China, implying to the US that the deterioration of the situation in China is enough to affect Japan's position in the Far East, teaching the US that it must immediately provide full assistance to Japan. The new instructions issued by the US on the 17th contain this intention, so in the eyes of the Japanese, it can be said to be "a dream come true," no wonder the defeated Japanese are all smiling with satisfaction.</p>
<p>However, in our view, the problem with the US "supporting Japan to contain communism" is not whether to support Japan, but whether supporting Japan can contain communism. All scholars familiar with Asian geography value the decisive influence of geographical factors on military diplomacy. We assume that a US-Soviet conflict is inevitable, and if it unfortunately breaks out, the US can only use Japan as a base for attacking the mainland. Regardless of the strength of its naval and air forces, it is difficult to have a grasp on victory. American military strategists, who have recently expressed their opinions on this point, unanimously pointed out that even General MacArthur, who is in charge of the control of Japan, is keenly aware that if China is controlled by the Communist Party, all of Asia will be inevitable, and Japan's position will inevitably be weakened, and it will be in the middle of a continental pincer. How can the wise diplomatic authorities of the United States not have even this basic common sense?</p>
<p>In short, if the US wants to abandon its Truman Doctrine of anti-communism and anti-Sovietism, it is better not to take the lead and continue the Cold War with the Soviet Union. Otherwise, it must not neglect the importance of China's position in the Far East. In other words, if the United States abandons the broad road of "aid to China" and wants to take the narrow path of "supporting Japan," it is tantamount to abandoning the fundamental for the superficial. In the future world situation, the United States will inevitably suffer the consequences and regret it too late. Therefore, today, we are still willing to uphold the righteousness of wartime allies, for the sake of world peace, we must ask "Will the US Intensify its Support for Japan?" to the American government and the public, and hope that they appeal to their conscience and foresight.</p>

<h3>Increased Production and Improvement of Ping Coal</h3>
<p>— Our Reporter Liu Zao</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper Nanchang Eighteenth Dispatch] The Pingxiang Anyuan and Gaokeng coal mines run by the Ganxi Coal Mining Bureau are currently burdened with a major task. Not only must they supply coal to the railways and power plants of Zhe-Gan, Yue-Han, and cities such as Changsha and Nanchang, but also a portion of the coal for civilian use in Jing-Hu and the motive power of the Ping-Han Railway must rely on Ping coal. Therefore, the Ganxi Coal Mining Bureau is currently making its utmost efforts to increase production and improve the quality of coal, in order to smoothly overcome the current difficulties.</p>
<p>While striving to increase production, they place some hope on American aid. However, the facts tell us that American aid has been a "beautiful prospect" all along. The American aid that the factory might receive was originally three million US dollars, and now an additional one million US dollars has been issued. The contract for purchasing equipment is currently being negotiated by the Resources Commission and the American firm Pierce Company.</p>
<p>Although the Ping Coal authorities are currently also living frugally, like everyone else, they are still continuously promoting production increase projects by "relying on their own efforts." It is reported that the first and second vertical shafts of Gaokeng have both been dug to the predetermined depth by mid-November, and are now engaged in the work of erecting beams and masonry. The second vertical shaft encountered a coal seam in mid-October, about 1.5 meters thick, which is quite valuable for mining. When the masonry is completed, a level tunnel will be opened at a depth of 190 meters in the well to prepare for coal production. Before the vertical shaft produces coal, in order to meet current needs, shallow mining projects are being strengthened, and new wells are planned to be excavated in Wangjiayuan and Zhanggongtang, with construction scheduled to begin in January next year.</p>
<p>The Quanjiang Weir power plant project saw its first 1,000 KW generator worked on day and night during the hottest days of the year, and it began supplying power on November 20th, solving the problem of insufficient power for Ping Coal. The second 1,000 KW generator is being installed, and the 2,000 KW generator originally stored in Shanghai is also being transported to Ping by the Zhe-Gan Railway. As long as these three generators are installed and the 4,000 KW power generation project is completed, Ping Coal can move from manual mining to mechanization, becoming the only mechanically mined mine in Jiangnan.</p>
<p>Strengthening transportation should be coordinated with the production increase plan. Currently, the mine has built the Quangao branch line from Gaokeng to Quanjiang Weir, which connects to the Zhe-Gan Railway, allowing coal produced from the first and third mines of Gaokeng to be transported to Baimao Temple Station for loading and external transportation. However, the coal produced from the fourth and fifth mines of Wangjiayuan and the mines of Anyuan must be transported to the station by shoulder carrying or handcart, which is not only expensive but also time-consuming. The mining bureau has now decided to erect an overhead cableway between Wangjiayuan and Baimao Temple. The equipment required for this project has been prepared, and construction began in mid-October. The trees along the line have been felled, and iron frames are being cast. It has also been decided to build a light railway between Anyuan and Pingxiang to facilitate transportation.</p>
<p>Ping Coal originally had a good reputation, but unfortunately, the operators of general earthen wells and coal merchants only knew how to seek temporary gains, mixing inferior coal with mud and stones, which was inconvenient to burn and reduced firepower, destroying the past reputation. Now, the Ganxi Coal Mining Bureau is striving to improve the quality of Ping coal. All coal produced in the mining area is not only manually selected and washed, but also equipped with coal washing machines to increase the washing capacity. The mine also has a chemical laboratory, and the coal produced in each well is chemically tested and analyzed at any time. This is extremely beneficial to the identification and improvement of coal quality, and is also a pioneering initiative among the coal bases in Central China.</p>

<h3>One Point on the Powers of the Federal Government Caused the Dutch-Indonesian Negotiations to Break Down: The Netherlands Insists on Using All Federal Armed Forces</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency Batavia Nineteenth Dispatch] The Dutch government's military action (pacification) today is the result of the failure to make progress in the high-level talks. These consultations completely broke down on December 11. The Dutch delegation stopped the consultations because the two sides could not agree on the powers of the High Commissioner during the planned tenure of the interim federal government. The government of the Republic of Indonesia believed that the government was only prepared to recognize Dutch sovereignty in form during the transition period. On the contrary, the Dutch side believed that the Dutch High Commissioner should have supreme power, including the control and use of the federal armed forces for foreign and domestic purposes.

The United States is now focusing on the Dutch-Indonesian situation through the United Nations Security Council. If there is any action, it will probably be submitted to the council for handling. The authorities believe that they should first understand the situation in The Hague and Indonesia before taking any steps, so there will not be any immediate decisions.</p>

<h3>Huge Crowds Surge in Front of City Bank: Thirty to Forty Thousand People Travel Back and Forth in Vain: Deposit Exchange Postponed: Simplifying Methods Being Discussed Today: Mayor Personally Issues Written Instructions and the Crowd Disperses Disappointed</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Report] After the change in the deposit exchange method, yesterday was the first period for distributing application forms for deposit exchange to public educators in the city. In order to handle the matter centrally, the authorities specifically entrusted the Shanghai City Bank on Jiujiang Road to exclusively distribute 400 application forms, while the Central Bank on the Bund was responsible for the accumulated cases of military and police personnel who had obtained permits before the 16th of this month but had not yet been exchanged. Unexpectedly, the crowding situation for public educators applying yesterday completely exceeded the authorities' expectations. Moreover, the application forms were concentrated and issued exclusively by the City Bank, which caused disorder in the exchange order and a large number of exchange people, which was unprecedented since the authorities implemented the deposit exchange method. If the security authorities had not worked hard to maintain order, and the public educators had not rationally controlled themselves, an unfortunate incident would have occurred again.</p>
<p>Since the authorities designated yesterday as the exclusive day for handling the application for deposit exchange for public educators, all public educators in the city spared no effort to save their hard-earned money, or tried to raise money from relatives and friends, in order to compete for this valuable ounce or two of gold. As a result, before the curfew time began the night before, many public educators lined up and waited at the entrance of the City Bank, willing to endure the wind and dew and sit and wait. Until dawn this morning, public educators from all directions rushed to queue up, and the police bureau, upon receiving the news, also sent a team to maintain order. However, the number of public educators flocking to the City Bank increased with time. Before 9 o'clock, the entrance of the City Bank was already crowded. At first, the line was winding, from Jiujiang Road to the west, to Sichuan Middle Road to the north, to Nanjing Road to the Bund and then to the south, and then back to Jiujiang Road to the City Bank. This was constantly circling, reaching a total of six circles, with an estimated number of about 30,000 to 40,000 people. How could the mere 400 application forms be enough to cope with this huge queue. The City Bank hesitated and could not decide, and the queue waiting outside could not withstand the pressure of crowding, squeezing, hunger, and cold, and the noise was constant, and the order began to be chaotic, and the military and police also felt unable to maintain order. Finally, some representatives were pushed out from the crowd of deposit exchange people, together with the personnel maintaining security, and consulted with the City Bank authorities to request additional application forms. The City Bank authorities immediately called Mayor Wu for instructions, and Mayor Wu personally issued a written instruction, which read in brief: "Today's application number is unbearably crowded. It has been decided to convene a meeting of central and local agencies and schools on the afternoon of the 20th to discuss a simple deposit exchange method to facilitate all public educators." All the public educators expressed their grievances, but they could not do anything about it and began to leave disappointed.</p>
<p>It is also reported that in the future, deposit exchanges for military and police personnel will be based on the permits issued by the Garrison Command and the Police Bureau, and the deposit exchanges will be handled in the Garrison Command every Wednesday. The second distribution of application forms to the general public by the four banks will be held on the 23rd.</p>

Wu concluded by quoting Yue Wumu's famous line: "If the world is to be peaceful, civil officials must not be greedy, and military officials must not fear death." He said: Today's situation is worse than when the Jin soldiers invaded the south back then. The soldiers at the front and the people in the rear should thoroughly awaken and use General Huang as a self-motivation, so that the great cause of suppressing the bandits and quelling the chaos can be completed in the shortest possible time.</p>
<p>Tears Streaming Down Their Faces, The Entire Assembly Was Moved</p>
<p>Subsequently, Yu Xingchu, a close friend of General Huang during his lifetime, reported on the life of Commander Huang, and Deputy Division Commander Yao of the 67th Division reported on the life of Division Commander Liu. During the report, Division Commander Li Shijing of the 108th Division also attended the meeting, supported by a handcart, escorted by guards. Division Commander Li was originally a subordinate of General Huang's 25th Army. After being transferred to the Corps, he was wounded in the battle of Nianzhuang and transferred to Shanghai for treatment. He had his last phone call with Commander Huang before leaving the front line. When he came to the meeting yesterday, his foot injury had not healed, he was wearing a cotton military uniform, and his spirit was excellent. However, after meeting General Huang's family members, he was reminded of his former superior, and they cried together. The entire assembly was deeply moved and could not stop wiping away their tears. Mayor Wu specially made a temporary motion to pay tribute to this national hero. The entire assembly stood up solemnly and bowed in salute amidst warm applause.</p>
<p>Thoroughly Awaken, Reflect, and Rise Up Together</p>
<p>Speaker Pan then delivered a speech, stating: Since the news of the martyrdom of Generals Huang and Liu spread, everyone, whether acquainted or not, was deeply moved. General Huang's troops had been stationed in Shanghai after their victory and were then transferred to northern Jiangsu. Their strict military discipline was well known to the citizens of Shanghai. A model soldier like General Huang was not only unafraid of death but also did not love money. If he was not afraid of death, how could he still love money? In other words, it was precisely because he did not love money that he was not afraid of death. Those who fear death are greedy for money. The formation of today's situation is really due to too many officials who fear death and greedy officials. If the officials in the front and rear can all emulate General Huang's integrity, how can the bandit forces be so rampant? China will definitely not perish. Pan also quoted General Huang's will, which stated that Shanghai is a den of sin and warned his eldest son to have ambition, aspirations, and not be affected by the bad environment. He pointed out that this remark should serve as a motto for every citizen of Shanghai. Everyone should be vigilant, thoroughly awaken, and reflect. In this difficult situation, we must strive to get rid of the temptation of pleasure and hope that this meeting today will be the starting point. Following in the footsteps of Generals Huang and Liu, we will rise up together and contribute all our strength to defend the nation.</p>
<p>Loyal and Refined Self-Encouragement, Continue Efforts</p>
<p>Fang Zhi's speech briefly stated: I have recently been entrusted by all circles in the city to go to the front line twice to comfort the soldiers fighting the bandits. Today, I would like to express my greatest condolences to the spirits of Generals Huang and Liu on behalf of the comfort group. The deaths of Generals Huang and Liu were heroic and caused national mourning. Now that the bodies of the two generals are dead, their spirit of loyalty and patriotism will remain in the hearts of the people forever and last as long as the life of the Chinese nation. So we don't have to be sad about the martyrdom of the two generals, but should be loyal and refined self-encouragement, take the two generals as the law, and continue to work hard for the bandit.</p>
<p>Then Shui Xiangyun, Long Guanjun and others delivered speeches one after another. Finally, Mayor Wu, on behalf of the general assembly and the National Comfort General Association, presented condolences and consolation money to General Huang's family. It was received by Huang's son Xiaoxian. The meeting ended at about 12 o'clock.</p>
<p>General Liu's Biography</p>
<p>Now attached is General Liu Shenghe's biography as follows: Division Commander Liu Shenghe, half-shou age, native of Mianyang, Hubei, graduated from the seventh phase of the infantry department of the military school, and served as platoon, company, battalion commander, deputy division commander, brigade commander, division commander, etc. He participated in suppressing bandits and resisting Japan. In this war, he was injured six times and never left the military. This time, he participated in the Xudong campaign. At first, in the Xin'anzhen area, he led his troops to intercept the bandits coming south from Tancheng, and then followed the army on the east bank of the Grand Canal, resisting the bandits coming south from Pixian and attacking the bandits coming north from Yaowan, covering the entire 7th Corps to cross the iron bridge of the Grand Canal. He was able to complete the task, and finally, with less than a regiment, he was trapped by bandits more than ten times in Zengbajic. Division Commander Liu led his troops in a bloody battle, repeatedly charging and killing. Unfortunately, the officers and soldiers were almost completely killed, the ammunition was exhausted, and the reinforcements were cut off. The position was broken by the bandits. He sent out the last telegram: "Sheng has an old mother above, and a weak wife and young daughter below. The family is poor. Please take care of them properly. The post will take the determination of a revolutionary soldier not to succeed and become benevolent, coexist with the position, and repay the country and the leader," etc. Then he collected wheat straw, piled it in the garden, covered it with a door panel, ordered his armorer to destroy the traces after his death, and then shouted Long live the Republic of China, long live the President, and shot himself with a gun, which hit the brain and killed him. This was the matter of 14:00 on November 11. According to Liu's guard Guo Qingsheng, when General Liu committed suicide, he tried to snatch the gun to stop him. The general glared at him and scolded, "Do you want me to be captured by bandits?" And kicked him to the ground, so he could not stop him. Alas, the loyalty of the general is enough to move the heaven and earth and cry the gods, and inspire the late world. However, General Liu has a 75-year-old mother above, and a weak wife and two young daughters below. After his death, he is desolate, so what should he do? It is also heard that Liu's wife is currently living at No. 7 Tieping Lane, Suzhou. Her body was originally weak, and recently, due to the bad news of General Liu, she has not eaten for ten days, causing the several-month-old unborn child to suddenly have a miscarriage, and the situation is even more tragic. Now, Generals Zhou Zhidao, Dai Jian, Huang Xiang, Xu Wuyan, and Zhang Xuzi have jointly requested the superiors to report to the government, to declare General's martyrdom in the history museum, and to give him a national funeral and preferential treatment to comfort the heroic spirit.</p>

<h3>Saint John's University</h3>
<p>Wins University Basketball Championship</p>
<p>In the finals of the third university basketball tournament on the 18th, Saint John's University defeated Fudan University 46-27 to win the championship of the group. They will play against the champion of the group Jiaotong University to determine the university championship. Jiaotong University has lost to Saint John's in the first two tournaments. Now that they meet again on a narrow road, a special venue will be borrowed from the city gymnasium to hold the event. The battle between the two schools will surely be a heated performance.</p>
<p>The game between Saint John's and Fudan was held at Fudan. The players of Saint John's were not used to the hard ground. Fudan took the lead 8-7 in the first quarter. In the first half, Saint John's came from behind to lead 25-11. After the break, the two teams fought again. Fudan's Zhuo Guanzheng was resourceful, and Saint John's Qian Tujun and Zhuang Yirong attacked on both sides, making it difficult to distinguish. Saint John's was still in the lead in the third quarter. In the last quarter, Saint John's Sun Guoqi's long shots were excellent, and Fudan was far behind and unable to turn the tide. After Saint John's Tao Yingshi graduated due to fouls, Fudan could have taken the opportunity to attack, but the score difference was too large, and Fudan had no intention to fight. As a result, Saint John's defeated Fu with a score of 46-27 and won the championship of the group.</p>

<h3>In the Eyes of "Upper-Class Refugees," the First "Stronghold": Hengyang Is Unexpectedly Lively</h3>
<p>— Special Correspondent for Our Newspaper, Huang Chao-Ru</p>
<p>[Express News from Changsha, 16th of This Month] Hengyang, this small, inconspicuous city, suddenly became an important town in the rear during the Anti-Japanese War due to its geographical location. Commerce flourished, and the population increased sharply, reaching its peak for a time. Towards the end of the Anti-Japanese War, the 47-day Battle of Hengyang became famous. However, this city that rose during the war was unfortunately completely destroyed in this battle.</p>
<p>At the beginning of the victory, Hengyang did not have a single complete house. There were broken walls and ruins everywhere, and desolate weeds and smoke. Then came the great famine in southern Hunan, and Hengyang became a city of famine victims. After these successive disasters, Hengyang survived in a dying state. Now, except for the main streets of Zhongshan Road North and South, which have neon lights and broadcasts of decadent music, and crowded pedestrians in the evening, there is not much difference from the time of victory in other places. Everyone feels like they are dreaming about restoring the scene during the war.</p>
<p>Distinguished Guests Arrive, Temporarily Observe the Situation</p>
<p>However, due to the tense situation of the locust war, wealthy merchants from Beijing and Shanghai are vying to "flee" south, and Hengyang has unexpectedly become lively again. Of course, the "escape" destinations of wealthy merchants will not be Hengyang. The most important thing is definitely the United States, followed by Hong Kong and Taiwan, and then Guangzhou and other places. However, everyone knows that going to the United States is beyond the reach of ordinary people, and the prices in Hong Kong, Guangdong, and Guangzhou are also quite difficult to bear. Many "refugees" who ran to Hong Kong and then turned back shook their heads and sighed, "Hong Kong and Guangzhou are good, but they can't stay for long." Therefore, Hengyang, which is also considered a "safe zone," has been honored by these distinguished guests. They regard Hengyang as the first stronghold for "evacuation," temporarily hiding here to observe the situation. It is very convenient to go from Hengyang to Hong Kong, Guangzhou, Guilin, and even into Guizhou and Yunnan. In addition, people from the Beijing and Shanghai areas who had lived in Hengyang for many years during the war naturally have a sense of familiarity with Hengyang. At this time, everyone is "escaping," so why not make a trip down memory lane? As a result, Hengyang has gradually become lively in the past month, and everything is thriving.</p>
<p>Rumors Abound, Nerves Are Tense</p>
<p>Recently, the place that shows the revival of the wartime lively scene in Hengyang is the East Railway Station of Hengyang. On the Yuehan Railway, long trains of carriages are piled with passengers like "sardines." Although many of them pass through here to Guangzhou, there are also many who get off here and transfer to Guilin. Not only are there passengers, but also many government officials, official documents and goods from agencies, and relatives of civil servants. The Hengyang Station has become congested. When this unusual scene first unfolded, the citizens of Hengyang couldn't help but feel both happy and worried, and doubts arose. There were many rumors on the streets, and everyone's nerves were a little tense and sensitive, causing trouble for no reason. There was a situation of "a storm is brewing." Not only the citizens but even government officials and news reporters were like this.</p>
<p>Here are two small anecdotes specially reported that are enough to make people smile:</p>
<p>Four Aircraft in the Sky Over Hengyang - The Truth</p>
<p>One noon, four transport planes were spotted in the sky over Hengyang. After circling slightly, they landed at the airport. In the past, although planes also took off and landed in Hengyang every day, it had never been seen that four planes landed at the same time. So the personnel at the airport had a flash of inspiration, thinking that it must be important central leaders coming south. They rushed to greet them, and when they opened the hatches, they only saw seven of the latest model small cars and boxes loaded in each plane. They retreated in disappointment. When news reporters went to inquire about the news, they couldn't help but be greatly disappointed after hearing the truth and looked at each other speechlessly. It was heard that the four planes were passing through Hengyang to Guangzhou and landed to refuel. One said that they were China Aviation passenger planes, but China Aviation then publicly denied it.</p>
<p>Family Luggage Mistaken for Important Officials</p>
<p>At around 11 o'clock on the same night, the city government and various newspaper offices suddenly received information that Vice President Li's special train was passing through Hengyang. The municipal leaders and news reporters who heard the news dared not miss the opportunity, so they braved the night cold to welcome him across the river. When they arrived at the station, the news reporters immediately launched a surprise attack and inquired about Vice President Li's whereabouts. As a result, there was no Vice President on the "special train." It turned out that it was the family members and luggage of important officials from Guangxi, such as Xia Wei, Li Pinxian, and Beijing-based legislators. There were about 400 people in total. The entire train was occupied by them, including two first-class carriages, four second-class carriages, and five baggage cars. It was heard that the luggage of a certain important official alone reached as many as 400 pieces, almost occupying one carriage. By this time, it was late at night, and those who went to welcome him had to return with a loss of interest.</p>
<p>Many Fantasies, Reality Is Even More Miserable</p>
<p>Today, Hengyang is in this tense and sensitive atmosphere. Everyone is fantasizing that a very different situation will unfold soon. They are calculating how to grasp this situation and weaving a beautiful picture of future life. Before the beautiful imagination has been woven, the painful reality that has arrived has intensified, because the land, houses, and goods in Hengyang have been rising rapidly these days, although they are still much cheaper than in Hong Kong and Guangzhou.</p>
<h3>NANTUNG'S ECONOMIC HEART: TA SHENG COTTON MILL CELEBRATES ITS FIFTIETH ANNIVERSARY</h3>
<p>— OUR CORRESPONDENT TSUNG YUNGSHU</p>
<p>(NANTUNG, 14TH - VIA EXPRESS) TA SHENG COTTON MILL holds a special place in Nantung's history. It is not just another factory; Nantung owes its prosperity to it. Founded in the 24th year of the Guangxu reign (1899 AD), it is now exactly fifty years old. My visit on the eve of this milestone makes it all the more significant.</p>
<p>TA SHENG COTTON MILL is located in Tangzha Township, about fifteen li northwest of Nantun County. From here, it's only ten li to Tian Sheng Port, the largest port of entry/exit in Northern Kiangsu. Tangzha is a large market town at the southern end of the Tung-Yu Highway, and the surrounding area is the famous</p>
<p>TUNG COTTON PRODUCING AREA</p>
<p>The fine cotton from Tungtai and Taichungchieh, as well as cotton from along the Tung-Yu Highway, are all conveniently transported here. In the past, when northern Kiangsu was peaceful, large trucks carried bales of cotton down the Tung-Yu Highway, and ships full of cotton arrived. The TA SHENG COTTON MILL never had to worry about raw materials. Unfortunately, in recent years, the countryside has been unsettled, making it difficult to transport the fine cotton from places like Taichungchieh south, and procurement has become quite troublesome. During the period when price controls were enforced, precisely when cotton was at its peak, even a single load of cotton was hard to buy. The factory nearly shut down, but fortunately, they purchased a batch of Indian cotton to temporarily help. However, to maintain operations, they switched to a three-day work schedule, operating for three days and then resting for three days. Recently, things have been better, and they can still maintain operations by collecting some cotton.</p>
<p>TA SHENG TEXTILES</p>
<p>The company has four factories. The one in Tangzha is called TA SHENG MILL Number One. There is also TA SHENG MILL Number Eight, also called TA SHENG MILL CHIH, located south of Nantung city. TA SHENG MILL Number Three is in Haimen, a place that was named after the factory itself. There is also TA SHENG MILL Number Two in Chiulongchen, Chongming. Mill Number One, the oldest, occupies over 100 mu of land and is divided into two factories. It originally had 92,500 spindles, but they were destroyed by the Japanese during the occupation. Now, only 73,000 spindles can be operated. There were originally 600 looms, but only two-thirds are currently in use, totaling five hundred. If production is normal, it can produce 130 bales of yarn and 600 bolts of cloth per day. The entire factory has over 150 staff members and over 5,800 workers, with female workers accounting for more than three-fifths of the workforce. Most of the workers live in Tangzha Township and the nearby countryside. The factory pays considerable attention to the welfare of its workers, providing literacy classes, apprentice training classes, a staff clinic, a staff cooperative, a staff reading room, a staff sports field, and a staff recreation room. For the education of staff children, there is a school for staff children. There are also favorable provisions for things like pensions for worker deaths, subsidies for female worker births, and relief for poor workers.</p>
<p>TA SHENG COTTON MILL is the economic heart of Nantung. As long as it's running, Nantung's agriculture, industry, and commerce are all active. Nantung owes its prosperity to it.</p>
<p>For fifty years, TA SHENG COTTON MILL has been supporting</p>
<p>Various undertakings in Nantung:</p>
<p>Educational initiatives, such as Nantung College and its affiliated hospital, Tungchow Teachers College, Girls' Teachers College, and schools for the blind and deaf, and charitable endeavors, such as homes for the elderly, orphanages, and institutions for the disabled, rely on the support of the mill. The circulation of Nantung's local financial economy also depends on TA SHENG COTTON MILL to maintain flexibility. Therefore, TA SHENG COTTON MILL has a special relationship with Nantung, unlike factories in other places. It was established in Nantung, brought prosperity to Nantung, and used local industry for local construction, which is a great example.</p>
<p>To commemorate this historically significant 50th anniversary, TA SHENG COTTON MILL has established TA SHENG Memorial Primary School near the factory. The school building is currently under construction. At the same time, a bronze statue of Chang S'en Kung and a commemorative碑will be erected in front of the personnel department office to remember the pioneers. On the 18th of this month, a warm commemorative ceremony was held to celebrate and inspire.</p>
<p>MEMORIAL STONE OF MR CHANG TSE NGAN OF NANTUNG - (RECEIVED VIA EXPRESS BY OUR CORRESPONDENT TSUNG YUNG FU)</p>
<h3>On the Yu Road: Bad People Reap Bad Consequences - By Our Reporter Jin Tao</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Beiping, Our Newspaper, 10th] The Shen-Yu Road is so long, hearts are so anxious, and the Communist bandits are so full of tricks. However, people must go west and return home. The bandits sift downwards along the way like a sieve, sifting out soldiers and those they deem criminals. They sift road by road, retaining strong officers and soldiers (especially those from the Northeast). Near Suizhong and Shanhaiguan, they were detained, escorted back, organized into teams, and taken off the main road, away from the eyes of the public, and escorted back to Shenyang or Harbin via small paths, never to be "liberated."</p>
<p>In the past, there were certainly many shrewd and self-respecting individuals in the Northeast National Army ranks, but there were also many who acted recklessly. These bad officers and soldiers came from all provinces. On the road, I heard the villagers' complaints: so-and-so beats people, curses people, steals chickens, slaughters pigs, and demands fodder and grain without any rules. They made the good people suffer immensely. The actions of intelligence personnel were even more infuriating.</p>
<p>Those bad people are truly the greatest sinners of the nation. They made the people shed tears in their stomachs, made the people helpless, made the people change their allegiance, and built a high wall and dug a wide ditch between the military and the people, resulting in non-cooperation and reduced intelligence, giving the entire National Army a fatal blow.</p>
<p>In addition, some soldiers have started families, marrying wives. Squad leaders, platoon leaders, company commanders, and even some soldiers have married and had children, always thinking of their families first, prioritizing family matters above all else, putting personal interests before public duties, dividing their energy, and ruining their motivation. Family burdens and responsibilities have further driven them to engage in business, ultimately affecting the overall situation.</p>
<p>In this westward movement of soldiers, many family members followed, enduring great hardship. Some took peasant-pulled carts, traveling in an endless stream. When encountering several teams of "irregular troops" on the Rao Yang River, who were marching, they mocked, ridiculed, and taunted these officers and soldiers. Many shouted at the families of soldiers on the carts: "Look at the officer's wives!" "How did you get defeated!"</p>
<p>Don't Communist soldiers marry wives? Yes, they don't. They have excessive restrictions. Not only can squad leaders, platoon leaders, and company commanders not marry wives, but battalion commanders cannot either. Only at the regimental commander level can they marry. And they marry well-trained wives, female staff members with firm Party consciousness and faith. What about the others? They either wait for the future or find other ways out.</p>
<p>Do Communist soldiers not need grain or grass? They do, and they need a lot. As soon as they took Shenyang, they started demanding grass and grain from the villagers. For every ten acres of land, they demanded 150 bundles of grain and a certain amount of grass immediately. Some places demanded even more. In Beizhen and Luyangyi, I saw cart after cart of grain being delivered. The mentality of the people is still, "Whoever is the emperor, we give tribute to." It is said that "the Eighth Route Army's demand for grain, grass, and carts is the responsibility of the farmers' association, with a fixed amount, not everyone demanding grain, everyone demanding grass, and everyone demanding carts, or even selling it and then demanding it again, with a few pocketing the money and the government not getting the benefits."</p>
<p>On the road, I saw nearly a column of Communist troops marching. Everyone, except for a gun or sometimes no gun, had almost nothing else. Lightly equipped, they marched quickly. Platoon, company, and battalion commanders all walked together. "Add oil," "Eat at XX," sometimes it was a burst of applause, sometimes they sang short and lively songs, which had a great effect.</p>
<p>Communist soldiers come from the people and have mostly not shed their peasant roots. The Communists subject them to strict training, with only vertical control and no horizontal connections. They only know how to sell their lives and can only consider charging forward, like a flood, like madness. Everyone has only this one path!</p>

<h3>Second Batch of Taiwan Sugar for Japan to be Shipped Out Completely Within the Month</h3>
<p>The second batch of Taiwan sugar totaling 20,000 tons for export to Japan by the Taiwan Sugar Corporation, of which 17,000 tons had already been shipped in two giant vessels, the remaining 3,000 tons is soon to be completed, and the entire amount can be shipped completely within this month. The third batch of Taiwan sugar for export to Japan will start shipping between February and March next year. According to the person in charge of the company, major cities in Japan have now become fixed export markets for our Taiwan sugar.</p>
<p>In addition, the sugarcane planted by the company this year has now fully grown and is scheduled to start sugar production after January next year. There are a total of 37 sugar factories preparing for sugar production, of which 35 produce granulated sugar and 2 produce brown sugar. It is estimated that the sugarcane planted this year can produce 400,000 tons of Taiwan sugar.</p>
<h3>Taiwan Sugar Production Increases, Reaching 450,000 Tons This Year</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] The Taiwan Sugar Corporation's original estimated sugar production for this year was 400,000 tons. However, due to the better climate this year compared to previous years and fewer wind disasters, sugarcane fields have generally had bumper harvests. Therefore, it is estimated that this year's sugar production can increase to 450,000 tons.</p>
<p>In the current situation, the domestic market has become narrower. Therefore, the company authorities will focus on securing foreign export markets in the future.</p>
<p>According to the current world market price of sugar, taking 96-degree raw sugar as the standard, it is approximately 5 cents per pound in New York (including tariffs, etc.). Calculated at this market price, Taiwan sugar production must reach more than 600,000 tons annually for exports to break even. To achieve this export level, the company authorities can only dedicate themselves to increasing production. The only obstacle to increased production is the lack of working capital.</p>
<p>For example, taking this year's sugar production as an example, assuming 400,000 tons, sugarcane farmers should receive 200,000 tons under the sugar distribution method as compensation for planting sugarcane. However, the result of the sugarcane farmers' sugar distribution last year was that they suffered losses because the sugar price happened to be low after obtaining the physical sugar. Therefore, this year, they will request the company to change to paying cash according to the market price of sugar. And the funds required for these 200,000 tons of sugar have reached NT$500 billion, a huge amount. Even with the financial strength of the Bank of Taiwan, its maximum issuance amount is only NT$92 billion. It also feels helpless in the face of this huge demand for funds. To protect the interests of sugarcane farmers and increase their interest in planting sugarcane, these funds must be fully raised to maintain Taiwan sugar's production next year. It is heard that the Central Bank and relevant authorities have expressed sympathy for the company's urgent need for working capital and promised to work together to find a solution.</p>
<h3>Cigarette Industry in Decline</h3>
<p>Shanghai Municipal Industrial Association Technology Committee news: There are 95 cigarette factories in the Shanghai area, employing more than 35,000 workers. The monthly output of various cigarettes is approximately 120,000 cases, accounting for about 50% of the total national production.</p>
<p>Recently, due to the spread of war and the expansion of the war zone, sales channels have become narrower. At the same time, heavy taxes, high wages, and insufficient capital turnover, requiring high-interest loans to cover necessary expenses, have greatly affected costs. More than one-third of factories have been forced to suspend operations, directly affecting the livelihoods of workers and indirectly reducing national tax revenue. It is facing the most dangerous and desperate situation. If the authorities do not provide low-interest loans for relief, not only will the future of the industry be unimaginable, but the impact on national tax revenue will also be extremely great.</p>
<h3>Silver and Iron Industries Settle Interest Today, All Banks and Firms Take a Day Off</h3>
<p>The silver and money industries will handle the semi-annual interest settlement matters as usual today. All banks and firms will take a day off to the outside world, and internally will step up the settlement of semi-annual accounts. In addition, the yarn and cloth markets, etc., are also closed for one day due to the suspension of bill exchange today.</p>
<h3>Last Month's Export Volume</h3>
<p>More Reduced Than in October, Especially Silk and Bristles</p>
<p>The Shanghai Commodity Inspection Bureau of the Ministry of Industry and Commerce announced that the number of export commodities that passed inspection in November decreased compared to October, especially raw silk and hog bristles. The amount of beans has slightly increased compared to October. The detailed figures are as follows:</p>
<p>(A) Vegetables and Fruits (1) Chestnuts, pears, and 7 other types, totaling 12,271.72 metric tons; (2) Potatoes and 7 other types, totaling 1,982 metric tons.</p>
