<h3>立法院會表決通過　接受四億美援案　授權政府商訂雙邊協定</h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿二日電〕立法院廿二日晨曾議中，聽取外交部長王世杰關於美國援華法案之報吿及其對各委員質疑之答覆後，以三三七人（在塲委員三九四人）之贊成，表決通過接受此項總額四億美元之援助，授權政府與美國磋商簽訂正式雙邊協定，並對美援妥善運用。</p>
<h3>王外長報告　交涉美援經過</h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿二日電〕立法院第一會期第十四次會議，廿二日晨九時念分舉行，孫科主席，宣讀報吿事項，通過上次會議紀錄後，即由王外長報告有關美援事項，渠首先縷述自去夏以來與美國交涉經過，略謂：最初擬同華盛頓進出口銀行貨款，然此種需要償付之商業性貸款，不適於予我國進行大規模計劃建設之援助，故無何結果，至十月廿七日始有一小規模政治性之中美救濟協定訂立，由美國先後依一九四七年援外法案撥款四千五百萬美元，以救濟性質供給我國五大都市糧食配售。當時美方即曾表示，視世界局勢之緊迫，將有大規模之援歐計劃，經各方努力相助，援華計劃亦同時擬就，兩案在國曾提出後，即決定援華亦必援歐及兩案必須同時成立之原則，於是本年四月三日美兩院通過一整體之援外法案，唯法案中僅規定援助款項最高限額，確數猶須俟國會撥款委會審查後取決於兩院，是以最近經此程序款項復有削减。其次外長並說明我國向美國交涉援助之目的分爲四點：（一）棉，油，米糧之入超乃國內經濟現狀所使，故需外援以平衡外匯。（二）晨·工業之維持與發展，需要外援。（三）軍需物資之供應，需要外援。（四）幣制改革之準備基金，尤需特權援助。</p>
<h3>我自助計劃簽協定後提出</h3>
<p>此四項目標，前三者均得美國之支持，唯對第四項幣制改革，美國認爲於第一期十二個月之援助內尙難談及。美國援華法案中規定之援助款項，現經決定爲總額四億美元，自本年四月三日該案成立時起，於一年中加以使用。其中一億二千五百萬美元特種援助無須償還，我可以之購買軍需物資，其餘二億七千五百萬元經濟援助，除六千萬美元爲特種建設貸款外，其餘亦均可望以贈予方式出之。唯此六千萬美元猶爲總額未經削减時所決定，現總額旣巳被削减達六千三百萬美元之多，我國將向美國交涉將此項特種建設貸款亦予比例减少。關於此項美援之運用，外長重行述及政院張前院長手訂之十項原則仍足沿用，以於中美雙邊協定簽字後提出自助計劃。渠並說明美國於該法案通過後先行指撥之五千萬美元，業已根據我顧大使於四月三十日與美國務卿之換文予以運用，援華物資已在途中，全部美援款項之動用，須於七月三日以前由兩國簽訂雙邊協定，否則各項援華事務即將停止進行，故亟盼立院能早日接受援華案，俾據以締結協定。至於運用美援之各項具體計劃，各主管部門正積極擬訂中，美方代表亦正協同調查各地可供開發之資源，將予預算案中分別列明提出立院審查。</p>
<h3>陳儀即赴杭履新　昨訪王雲五商浙省財政　沈鴻烈準備移交後赴臺灣休養</h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿二日電〕新任浙主席陳　，廿二日下午五時訪晤財長王雲五，商浙省財政問題，談廿餘分鏡辭出，陳並於廿一日及廿二日先後訪謁翁文灝，何應欽，邵力子等，二三日後赴浙履新。</p>
<p>〔本報抗州廿二日電〕沈主席適値年度結束以前更動人事，故特電請陳儀速來杭履新，各廳處均巳準備移交。沈氏盼能於七月一日移交後，即赴臺灣作短期休養。新府委中，民·靑兩黨各佔一人。</p>
<h3>我向比所購軍火　二百噸經港運粵</h3>
<p>〔聯合社香港廿二日電〕今日報載，中國除向美國及加拿大購買軍火外，復向歐洲國家採購，新近有購目比利時之小軍械及子彈二百噸，往香港運交廣東省政府。</p>
<h3>後繼之美援　明春可見端倪</h3>
<p>外長並於其報吿之末明示：後繼之援助，將於明春見其端倪，渠稱：中國不應完全依賴外國，應努力實施自助計劃，以配合援助之充分利用，美國援外計劃原定以四年爲期，國會雖僅通過一年之措施，但仍不失其連續性，倘此一年間我國運用此項援助卓有成績，明春美國會再度討論此事時，我自具備較優之條件，以獲得更多之援助。</p>
<p>王外長報告畢，蕭錚，吳鐵城等主不必交付審查，逕由院會討論，陳顧遠，江一平等則表反對，以爲茲事體大，且爲報吿事項，依照議程應先付審查，經表決後以三九二人（在場委員四七四人）贊成，通過變更議程，逕由大會討論，各委員即依次發言，就此案發表意見，提出詢問。問題多集中於美國援華法案第四〇五款規定雙邊協定中包含中國所承允之事項之性質及援助之運甩各問題，當由王外長分別答　，各委員於聆廳後，報以信任而滿意之掌聲，美國援華法案遂以立委絕大多數之贊同，爲我國家最高立法機關接受，午前會議乃於十二時半結束。</p>
<h3>國民黨推定七人研究我對外政策</h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿二日電〕國民黨爲研究我國對外政策及盟邦對日態度問題，曾於廿一日中政會中廣泛討說，與會各委員發表意見者甚多，最後推定孫科，王寵惠，翁文灝，陳布雷，吳鐵城，王世杰，李惟果等七人作初步研究，以備參考。至政府將對美扶植日本問題發表聲明之說，尙屬言之過早。</p>
<h3>史蒂爾曼調查團願協助修湘黔路</h3>
<p>〔本報長沙廿二日電〕史蒂爾曼廿一日晚由湘潭去衡，廿二日赴穗。該團對湘黔路沿綫鑛產豐富，至爲注意，願協助修復湘黔路。美籍鐵道顧問韓士鼎，對此項工程尤感興趣。韓氏意見；此路第一步最好能通溆浦，至少亦應通新化。所需鐵軌於粵漢路改變後，移出輕託戰全部撥充，所需枕木就地取材。是湘人多日夢想之修復湘黔路，已有接近實現之望。</p>
<h3>王外長解釋雙邊協定　不涉及我國航權　出售物資可收致減少發行之效</h3>

<p>專論</p>
<h3>遊日觀感</h3>
<p>— 吳高</p>
<p>最近余前往東京一行，實地調查盟軍佔領下日本的一般情形，曾防問麥帥及中英兩國代表團的負責人員，並曾與日本各界人士暢談一切。此行所得的印象，殊爲深刻，一言以蔽之，惟有日本經濟的崩潰與赤化，始爲整個太平洋和平的嚴重威脅</p>
<p>金對於日本的經濟及軍事情形，曾向各方面搜集資料甚豐，使余不能不信：日本經濟復興及重整軍備，非有二十年至五十年的長時間，不足以構成對中國成美國的眞正威脅。據麥帥語人，他永遠不會聽任日本死灰復燃，構成軍事的威脅。他這句話，凡曾至日本考察眞相者，當能知之。目下日本的「武力」，僅有日警十二萬五千人，平均每五個警察有老式手槍一枝，而且其中有一半已不可用。此並非盟總缺乏軍械之謂，而實因麥帥不信任日人所致。余與麥帥晤談時，從其口吻中獲悉，麥帥前在菲律賓與日軍作戰所得之痛苦經驗，終生難忘。以言日本「海上安全廳」，我國內與論界議論紛紜，謂其足爲日本未來海軍之基礎；此稱說法，按之實際，並不盡然。所謂「海上安全應」者，僅有七八十噸之小艇三十八艘，而且都沒有武裝；此種小艇僅充作救護及防制走私之用而巳。</p>
<p>但是在另一方面，日本共產當的勢力，有如旭日之東昇，不斷的擴大，究其原因，乃由於日本的經濟情勢所促成。目前的日本，糧荒問題旣無法解決，經濟界一般情形又極紊亂，以致造成一般經濟水準的低落，徒有助於日本共產黨的發展；此種情形，若任其自然，不加制止，則恐將有驚人的進展。據日本共產黨宣稱，該黨擁有黨員五萬人至六萬人，但據外人估計，僅以其外衛而論，至少約有一百萬人，尤以接近蘇聯的日本北部爲最多。他們是有名的「飯碗」共產黨，萬一將夾蘇聯決定「跳島」，侵入日本北部，但是他們的「飯碗」仍是可保無虞的。惟一般日人，大半織默寡言，心中雪亮，都非常明白。中美兩國人民對日戰爭中，苦痛備嘗，對於日兵的暴行，比生難忘，故余信日本在盟總管制之下，將永無翻身的一天。但是在他們日本人看來，眼前也有一個希望，這就是共產主義。他們以爲蘇聯並未眞正與日本打仗，因此蘇聯人民在日本人的心目中，不像對中美兩國人民有不可磨滅的不愉快的回憶。何况蘇聯最歡迎赤色的日本加人他們的陣營哩！日本共產黨表面上雖沒有國際背境，但是日共與韓共是有聯絡的，而韓共與我國東北的中共又是有往來的。假如日本，北韓，與我國東北結成一個共產黨的集團，那末蘇聯在遠東也就可有一個「鐵幕」，而爲所欲為了。蘇聯對此，是決不會坐失良機的。故在目前，我們中國人如果不放大限光看淸世局的眞相，一味盲目的反對，美國此刻執行的對日政策，那就無異贊成迫使日本赤化了！</p>
<p>日本赤化的危險，盟織並不等閒視之。其實盟總的經濟政策，就是要使日本避免經濟的破產，不爲共產黨乘虛而入。例如土地改革，增加糧食進口，逐漸恢復對外貿易，以及增加生庫水準等等，無一不在次第實行之中。盟總認爲，這是抵抗共產主義對日威膏唯一的辦法。惟有共產國際，對於盟總的經濟政策，眞能深知其目的何在，於是千方百計，在中國從事大規模的宣傳運動，想造成中國人民的錯覺，由職業學生和文化販子的反美扶日運動，變爲一般國民眞正的反美遝動，使中美兩大盟邦，有了間隙，而後他們可以安心放手去赤化亞洲，赤化世界。但以余觀察所得：日本工衆在二三十年內決不會威脅中·美·英三國的市塲，我的理由有二：（一）戰前日本的原料供應地業已喪失，故不能再取得低廉之原料；（二）因盟總鼓勵工會及集體契約，使日本低廉的工資也不復存在，甚至其工資的水準，遠在中國之上。例如絲織的和服一套，在東京的售價要美金十四元；但在上海只需美金五元即可以買到。要日貨廉價傾銷旣不可能，試想怎能與其他回家的貨物競爭呢？我國代表團商震將軍，也和我抱回一見解，不信日本經濟復甦即足以構成對中美兩國的威脅。</p>
<p>余對於麥帥的印象，也非常深刻，覺得他應該是美國第一流人物之一，可以競選美國總統；他如能時常返國，與選民多接觸，必能獲選。但麥帥對於國會的邀請，總以「職務羈身」爲理由，予以謝絕，專心致志於管理戰敗的日本，使它不成爲赤化的附庸。麥帥對於中國政局，頗多卓見，決非膚淺的認識。余與麥帥會晤時，本會涉及中國國內的許多問題；麥帥對中國問題的立塲，自本年三月三日致函美國衆議院外交委員會主席伊登，主張加緊援　以來，迄未改變。有人故意說他輕視中國在遠東所處的重要地位，只要一　麥帥詳談，就可知道這究全是無稽之談。母寗說他對於中國問題，有一個獨特的見解。他認爲中國政府目前若干不能集中全力解決軍事問題，則其他問題都無從談起；同時他又認爲中國政府若不能獲得美國的「全力」援助，則中國政府亦即不易解決其軍事問題。目下中國政府軍隊如果墨守成法，採取陣地戰的戰略，很難消除中共的軍事壓力，今後唯有採取新式的流動性的戰略，始能擊敗共軍。麥帥對於太平洋的認識最為廣泛，　談之下，令人相信，麥帥不特為菲律賓之麥帥，不特為日本之麥帥，抑且應為太平洋反極權之麥帥。他說在整個太平洋的形勢中，中國實爲反對極權主義的第一個堡壘。他也深知中國人民憂懼日人的心理，同時他也有其對日的痛苦的回憶，終生不忘，他決不會聽任日本軍國主義的死灰復燃的。以實際情形而論，他以爲即使第三次大戰發生，美國也不需要日本做她的盟國。</p>
<p>要之，今日之日本，完全在盟總管制之下。目前日本經濟的復興尙談不到；軍國主義的再起，祗少要在三四十年之後。但是，中英美三國必須堅固的聯合一致，否則受人挑撥，步調異趨，必招致不幸的後果。集權主義的宣傳家，巳以對日問題爲武裝，企圖分化中美關係了。這是我們不可不愼防，以免墮入此陰險的啗阱！</p>

<h3>蘇北前綫　合德鎮一宿</h3>
<p>— 本報特派記者凌松壽</p>
<p>〔本報阜寗十九日訊〕由於交通的關係，記者沒趕得上看國軍攻克合德鎭的戰役，但我抵達阜寗以後，馬上跨馬加　，一股勁兒跑到憧憬己久的合德鎭。</p>
<p>合德鎭是所謂蘇北的延安，至少在蘇北人的眼光中，是一個</p>
<p>神秘的地方　自戰前起，到現在快要十幾個年頭了，中間除去了敵人曾佔據了兩年多外，一直在共匪的盤踞之下，並且是共匪在蘇北戰區中的「司令臺」。</p>
<p>走出　寧，隨地都是小溪河流，這些一條條的河　，成爲濱海地區間的天然障碍，此次國軍進剿，在架橋的工作上，花了不少的時間，以致有機會使匪逃竄，未能收到理想中的戰果。阜寗城卅里以外的地區，在戰前，原都是極良好的墾區，可是在共匪十年的控制下，已經使千百頃的沃土，重渝爲荒地，蔓草橫生，一望千里，令人有說不盡的愴痛。</p>
<p>合德鎭並不是個　，跑到合德，打破了我一向對它的憧憬。在</p>
<p>射陽河南岸安放着一二百家的居戶，十字形的街道，兩旁稀稀落落地排列着簡陋的茅屋，……這就是合德。有一這小河，靜靜地從它的西北角流到東甫角，把它分成兩個部份。</p>
<p>合德鎭過去濱海地區的一個大鎭，並且有一所合德鹽墾公司在這裏。記者從空中攝得的影片上曾看到合德公司的平面，是一所很巨大很整齊的建築，它在合德鎭的東南角，距鎮中心約三華里，我跑去看時，屋內狼藉不堪，據說在這很平凡的幾所瓦屋裏，陳毅·粟裕·管文蔚·陳慶先……他們都曾住過很長的時間。合德公司而外，合德鎭的瓦屋就不多了，在南北街的南段有座華中銀行，東西街的東段有座合作社，還有鎭東北角的射陽民衆醫院，這些是合德鎭僅有的幾座瓦屋，並且還是敵人在這兒蓋的。</p>
<p>合鎭被共匪盤據了十年以上的時間，可是它們在這裏，不但沒有建設些什麽東西，並且迎原有的幾座小型麥廠，紗廠的機件都給破壞了。剩下來的只有它的一座修械所和一座被服廠，講田畝吧，你從軍用地圖或空中攝影的圖上看來，合德鎭</p>
<p>周圍數十里內，都是阡陌縱橫，一塊塊整整齊齊的墾區，可是目前除去了在合德鎭附近極少數的田地是種了農作物而外，其餘百分之九十以上的田畝，都在那見光着臉皮向着蒼天。記者從目四郊，遠念延安，近看合德，我痴痴地想着共匪萬一抓住了政權以後的局面。</p>
<p>除非真正地參加共匪或者是替匪徒們爲虎作　，否則在匪區中要想老老實實做個順民都不容易。田分過了，它可不是白白地分給你的，</p>
<p>公糧和公草還要預借，土幹要敲竹槓，要就××捐……一個人三畝田，大概想吃飽是不可能的。經商吧，它們有嚴密地控制，你貨物進出要登記，走出匪區要取保——保證你還回來，貨物販回來了，你要全部賣給他的商行中，給你一點微薄的利潤了事。當然，你所阪回來的東西，一定是他們所需要的，而實際上，最主要的貨物還是由他的幹部直接到江南採辦，用海船偸運回來。射陽河口到合德鎮僅有四十華里水路，這是形成合德鎭的重要性的主要原因。</p>
<p>合德鎭在國軍初進駐時，只有七百多婦孺老弱，三天以後，四鄉來歸的已增加了一倍的人口。合德鎮的人之視中央及國軍，也是一個謎。「十年了，這才看到了國軍。」這是一位七十歲高年的長老對我說的一句話。</p>
<p>合德一宿，重返阜寗。</p>

<p>〔合衆社費城廿二日電〕共和黨政策起草人今日披露政網，主張採取國際派外交，內政方面則主張繼續减稅，保障人權及與共產主義作殊死戰。政綱由百零四人動議委員會通過後，將於二十二日提交全代會正式表決。政　全長二千七百字，申述共和黨之原則，該黨希望藉此取得二十年來第一次總統選舉勝利。政綱保證政府經濟，反通貨膨脹，强大之軍隊，長期農　計劃，繼續塔虎脫·赫得利勞工法案，必要時加以改善，綜合墾荒計劃，及擴充安全制度。同時並嚴厲指斥杜魯門政府，處置內政外交之失當。外交部份主張繼續援助「愛好和平之國家」，限制聯合國內濫用否決權，組織聯合國武力，及「以善意之堅毅歡迎合作反對綏靖」之政策，援外方面條文如下：「在吾人經濟福利之限制以內，吾人將依自助助人之基礎合作，以援助其他愛好和平之國家而恢復其經濟獨立，人權及基本自由。吾人將堅決要求以實事求是及有效之方式推行一切援外事宜。政網又保證支援相互貿易制度，然「永遠保陣我國之農工業」，並保證依照聯合國懲章之文字精神完全承認猶太新國以色列。又稱：「吾人將主張對華友好之歷史性友　，並對其維持主權自由之努大深表關切」。動議委員會通過共和黨政綱計劃書，包括一兩重要追加條項」，一條主張承認以色列，另一條爲强硬之反共宣言而不直提蘇聯。政網前之原養宜言總括國際目標稱：「吾人之外交政策旨在自由人之自由世界中維護自由美國。此舉要求聯合國之强化，及基本承認美國對其他人民之自由有其興趣之權」。</p>
<p>〔路透社費城二十二日電〕共和黨全代大會二十二日起辯諭外交政策領之際，將發生意料以外之虧辯，抵達較遲之代表，對於外交綱領草案中之充分國際性，極有反感。印第安那州議員哈奈斯，於昨日深夜抵達後告記者稱，渠當會同其他代表，設法「拔除外交政策網領中之若千國際牙齒，」哈氏乃全代大會決議委員會之委員。</p>
<h3>伊里諾州州長格林　宣揚共和黨政策　對民主黨新政抨擊不遺餘力</h3>
<p>〔合衆社費城廿一日電〕伊里諾州州長格林廿一晚在此間共和黨全國大會發表政綱演說，謂共和黨將發動一項運動，俾在外交政策方面成爲「覓致和平」之政黨。在內政方面將對抗新政「編制」及「官僚政治」而採取「自由企業」政策。格林籲請各代表推選「更偉大美國之新領袖」，並作有把握之預料，謂共和黨將在十一月間大選中可當選總統及綱續控制國會。</p>
<p>格林復稱，新政不能以杜魯們取勝，但即使杜魯們未被提名競選總統，不論民主然全國大會提名何人爲總統候選人，其依照新政舊方針則一，而此項新政則已爲美國人民所不信。格林並向共和黨最保守份子提出警告稱：「吾人不再恢復至過去任何舊路，一切過去均告知吾人有未來之任務。」格林再三抨擊過去十六年來政府之「無效率」及「無生產之耗費」，對民主黨之外交行動抨擊尤力，渠痛斥當美政府已知戰爭不可避免時猶再三應許有和平。「政府所遵守之僅有諾言，顯爲政府向史達林所保證之諾言，由於此項諾言，第二次大戰之勝利已因討好蘇聯而虛有其名。吾人今日將而臨之世界大戰係新政與共產主義結合後之產物，新政決不能藉兩黨外交政策爲託詞而逃避此罪，因共和黨未曾參加德黑蘭，雅爾達，或波茨坦會議。」格林林保證共和黨將採取「十分堅定」之政策以確保和平，及恢復世界對美國外交之信任與尊搬。　復稱，共和黨外交歡策之重心，在於以英明及堅決，及增張美國之民主，而阻遏世界奴役制之蔓延。「吾人並不煽動股爭，反之，吾人將追求每一和平方法，吾人使此次大會成為和平之真正盟約。」</p>

<p>〔中央社新加坡廿一日電〕警方今晨開始在馬來亞全境搜索共黨恐怖份子，據悉，在雪蘭義逮捕一百十三人，內格里斯安布南捕獲卅人，霹靂捕獲六十人，（內有婦女十人）柔佛逮捕五十餘人，但仍有衆多之共黨嫌疑犯與恐怖份子逃脫法網。今晨警察曾同時搜索馬來亞全境共黨各支部·新民主靑年聯盟·及工會某數會所，然上述地點已大多數均人去樓空，各項文件亦已移走。</p>

<p>〔路透社費城二十一日電〕共和黨候選總統之競選人，已開始作爭取優勢的準備。觀察家僉信過去廿四小時以來，范登堡之獲勝希望，已較减低，此蓋由於范氏迄尚未曾明示願否被提名爲候選總統，渠本人之延至二十一日始自華盛頓抵此，以及支持杜威者突然發動閃電攻勢之故。杜威之支持者，昨曾與全代大會代表舉行會談，並舉行記者招待會，在旅舍中發動動人的宣傳，在會塲中第一次實力試驗，將見之於星期二全代大會證件委員會之表決中，蓋　其亞州之代表團，已演出雙包案，均自稱爲代表該州之共和黨，其一贊成提名杜威，另一贊成提名塔虎脫，證件委員會之表決確定何者爲合法代表團，即不啻爲杜威與塔虎脫兩人實力之測驗。據云，支持史泰遜者，在證件委會之表決中亦擬援支塔虎脫系，以阻撓鋒芒太露之杜威系，第二次實力測驗將見之於週二或週三外交政策之辯論中。衆院議長馬丁領導之孤立派，屆時將盡力以謀修正小組會通過之共和黨外交政策綱領。</p>
<p>〔中央社費城廿一日電〕共和黨全國大會召開後，會外形形式式不一而足，杜威。史泰遜及塔虎脫，均於費城飯店設競選總部，三人各自接洽奔走，緊張萬狀。麥克阿瑟競選總部，設於旅社，房屋較小，聲勢亦弱，今後三日內，競選即可初見分曉。</p>

<h3>六次大會第二日參議員展開質詢　責市府配米價有領導物價上漲趨勢</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕市參議會第一屆第六次大會，昨下午三時起，舉行第二次會議。議長副議長及參議員等前後共到一六八人。吳市長及市府各局處負責人均列席。四小時中，由各參議員分別與市長及財政·教育·公用·工務四局局長展開質詢及答復。雙方大體心平氣和。會議延至下午七時十分，始告結束。</p>
<p>今日下午起，將舉行第三次會議，議程所列，爲對警察·社會·地政·民政·衛生等五局之質詢及答復。各參議員送到大會之提案，迄昨日，已達一〇五件。大會收集提案，延至今日下午截止。</p>
<p>市長施政報告之質詢，昨午首先登塲。提出質詢之參議員有美豪·張中原·龐京周·童襄·王維骃·江浩然·兪傳鼎·趙仰雄·瞿鉞·范錫品·何成甫·陶廣川等十二人，茲將質訊問題擇要歸納如次；</p>
<p>（一）查本市若千政府機關，對各項公用事業，應納各費，常時抗繳，如電費，政府機關不納者，佔電力公司總收入百分之五至十，軍人無票乘車，佔乘客總數百分之三四十，如何處理。各項公用事業，二月來何能任其連漲三次，小民如何負担得了。（二）市府配米價格有領導黑市米價及物價上漲之趨勢。市府拋米不如均改作配米，俾市民直接受惠。又食米限值無法執行，不如取消。（三）救濟特捐進行程度若何？六底限期即到，向各業公會攤派，並非辦法，仍應針對豪門勸捐。（四）是否可請市長向中央爭取美援，並請市長宣佈運用美援計劃，參議會可否推派代表與問美援事宜。（五）今後市政，無論政治經濟各方面，均應請事前預防，則黎明前之黑暗，自易過去。（六）卅六年度之決算表，市銀行及興業信託社何故竟一無盈餘。（七）教育經費預算佔總支出百分之廿，而決算實支百分之十四，旣稱教育囿於經費，何故不用足額。（八）傳聞市府人事處將歸隸中央，如市府認爲編制不合，應聯合各地市政府向中央力爭是非。（九）處理學潮是否可先自輔導入手。（十）對安定社會平抑物價，今後是否有新政策。（十一）如何培養及獎勵優秀公務人員。</p>
<h3>市長答覆質詢　米價並未領導物價　征募特捐困難重要</h3>
<p>質詢完畢，市長登台答復，略稱：政府機關及人員拒繳各公用事業一費用，市府經常設法解決。市府各機關拖欠電費不多，短期即還淸，中央在滬各機關，市府曾電各關係機關商請解決，刻國防部曾派員來滬設法繳付。至軍人無票乘車，現決恢復軍警督察組織，恢復在各車站查緝取締。米價照一般物價統計，漲勢不及他物，故足證米價尚未領導物價。拋米配米而米價仍高，此因上海非產區，產區高漲上海無法獨低。配米原則，須求米源充沛。拋米爲調劑市塲，拋米後常派人四出偵查，是否依照限價出售，故限價仍須存在。汽油問題，明（廿三日）市府將與央行等會議商討辦法。救濟特捐之征募，困難重重。（一）對自然人之調查爲難，（二）豪門資產調查亦難。惟自由捐募如無法執行，市府當另擬妥善辦法。運用美援由中央決定，祗能向中央請示。教育經費支用不足額，原因在挖肉補搶，如工務局之養路費，衛生局之垃圾車修理費等，雖均超出預算，然又不得不立即移補，否則到處破路垃圾，市民立受影響。「安定社會平抑物價」，本人從未有此口號，現雖禾辦到，惟私心始終想辦到，蓋物價與通貨有關，而通貨率涉全國性，故地方政府對平抑物價祗能從旁協助中央而已。今日之學潮，借反美扶日爲口號，已非愛國與否之問題，而在態度之是否光明磊落，個人自信對交大事件態度始終不偏不倚，故決將此事公諸參議餚公及五百萬市民之前，判明是非黑白，免致將來人人均借好口實而行其私謀。</p>
<h3>稅員受賄　獎勵檢舉</h3>
<p>市長答復完畢，已近五時。休息十分鐘，各局質詢及答復開始。首爲財局，僅陶廣川提出二點；如何獎勵檢舉稅員受賄，如何防止受賄·田局長答：個人對部屬約束甚嚴，常囑尊重人格，如有發現即送法院查辦。防止受賄，獎勵小職員，尚不失爲根本辦法，本局無論各級人員出缺，均以老職員遞補，決不添新人，以資獎勵。</p>
<h3>師校校長貪污　教局正在澈查</h3>
<p>質詢教育局之參議員有張中原·范　品·瞿銊等，經李局長分別致答如次：（一）美術館之建設，哈同花園捐地十五畝已決定，現祇待慈善基金撥到即可興建。（二）校長需有官職之人士作保，此綠最近有一二市校長，因故離職，一走了之，故乃舊事重提。由各校長聯環作保之建議，值得參考。（三）新陸師範在洋涇院址建築材料已備好，待市府撥到工費，即可興建。（四）市立師範學校校長董承堅是否貪污，市府教局正在澈查。（五）老閘區設置國民學校，正在接洽校舍，暑假後必可設立。</p>
<h3>道路未能普修　限於經費困難</h3>
<p>向工務局提出質詢者有　雨亭施駕東等多人，由趙局長答復。渠稱：（一）北站區道路，因限於經費，未能普修。惟浙江北路近已動工修築，山西北路，塘沽路，河南北路等均將進行修理。車站南路之修築，因路綫屬於鐵路局，須待行政院核准方能動工。（二）本市工廠營建執照，仍以廿三年市府規定之工廠禁區辦法爲根據。（三）申請營營造執照，如有困難或留難情事，可請儘量告發。（四）肇和紀念塔因經費關係，未能即時興工。</p>
<h3>擬請監院澈查公佈　央行動用外匯實情</h3>
<p>市參會日昨繼續收到提案，有（一）傅汝霖·虞舜·王延松·陳公達·張志韓·季源溥等四十人提擬請監察院澈查公佈近二年來中央銀行動用外匯實情，與輸出入管理實况，以資借鏡，而謀改進案。（二）王立本·陳汝惠等提，爲暹羅政府蓄意摧殘華僑教育，非法取締華僑學校，可否以大會名義，呈請外交部提出嚴重抗議，提請公決案。（三）嚴罰聲提議，由本會電呈政院令飭中信局停止標售日貨呢羢案。（四）陳培德等提，本市地產權之轉移，須改革規定，以保田人員爲法定見議人案。（五）章祝三等提，擬請市府領導勞資雙方合力建造勞工新邨案。（六）范才睽等提，擬請市府提撥專款辦理勞工教育案。（七）賈德超提，擬請迅速趕修浦東大道全程路而及橋樑，以策安全而利交通案。（八）曹俊等提擬請市府即核發江灣區公地三十畝爲市立江灣中學校基案。（九）姜夢麟等提，爲本市圖書博物美術三館之建造地址基金旣已解決，應請市府從速成立建築委員會俾　定永久規模案。（十）姜夢麟等提，再請修現南市道路案。（十一）歐錦藻等提，市輪　應在盈餘項下，提成充作地方建設公衆事業費案。（十二）王子揚等提，爲業經決議填平之　嘉浜，迄未工竣，應否約期完工，以利交通案。</p>

<h3>請願五起　旅館業請撤銷管制　本報職員信屋被佔</h3>
<p>昨日參議會六次大會二次會議，前往請願者共有五起：（一）旅館業同業公會，爲該業獨受議價管制，要求轉請當局撤銷，以維生計。（二）銀樓業同業公會要求賣買飾金價格，依照結匯證明書計算。（三）蘇北難民及失業工人，要求發給三輪車照會。（四）市民金祥爲遭衛生局汽車軋傷左腿，要求轉請該局給予卹金。（五）申報職員孫元因所居南市阜民路三百二十四號住屋，於本月六日爲一自稱服務於憲兵部特高組之徐倫坊率衆强佔，至昨午三時，又侵入十餘人，孫受此寃屈，乃向參會請願。</p>
<h3>質詢拾零　物價政策如演「捉放曹」　治安問題市長「無肩胛」</h3>
<p>前昨兩天，第一名簽到的參議員，始終是高叔安。</p>
<p>開幕日，有人提議下午會議時間，自三時提早到二時半，結果仍維持三時原議。議長特別提出三時「正」，請大家「準」時到會，大家拍手贊和，不過，昨天姍姍來遲者，仍大有人在。</p>
<p>向市長質詢的江參議員浩然，質詢時全部演說姿態，演詞抑揚頓挫，段落分明，頗具示範性質。</p>
<p>趙參議員仰雄談到教育方面種種不滿現象時，說這也許是吳市長對教育不太感興趣的緣故。</p>
<p>范參議員錫品一口川白，質詢時說到吳市長做人「圓滑」，應付面面俱到，大家報以會心的微笑。</p>
<p>昨日提出質詢之參議員，何成甫比較最激昂，質詢也最久，鈴響了四次才下台。</p>
<p>何參議員說：市府對物價等政策，天天在演「捉放曹」，以後是否有新政策？他說：上海有許多治安問題，像舞潮案等，是市長「缺少肩胛」。</p>
<p>他又說：吳市長曾提出「安定社會，抑平物價」口號，而市長到任後二年來。社會不安，物價不穩，與日俱增。市長在答復中尷尬說：從未提出如此口號。</p>
<p>吳市長在答復人家指他「圓滑」一點時說：「我從無任何派系，所以辦事時，也不願任何派系，此或爲「圓滑」一詞之所由來」。</p>
<p>各局質詢中，財政局最爲風平浪靜，田局長上台輕描淡寫，就飄然下臺。</p>
<p>火綫集中公用局，趙局長答扳完畢將下台時，又被各參議員立起質詢「扣留」，下不得台，如此一而再，再而三，連續六次之多。</p>
<p>徐參議員則驤質詢時，說到南市時時斷電，感慨地說：南市市民負同樣納稅義務，而享受權利，却獨受歧視，是何緣故。贏得滿塲掌聲。</p>
<p>昨日質詢大體風平浪靜，可謂難得。</p>
<h3>海關員工三要求　李度定今日答覆</h3>
<p>准借薪一月分期扣還</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕江海關怠工事件，迄昨已歷四日，雖部分重要業務仍照常辦理，惟進口船隻無法卸貨，影響甚大。茲聞赴京請示之總稅務司李度，稅務司張勇年，稅務署署長張福運等，已携有結果返滬，今日將召集海關全體員工，答復渠等所提之三項要求：（一）准予借薪一月，惟須分期扣還。（二）提高待遇與四行兩局相等一事，因海關本身無權決定，須俟財部呈候政院討論確定後，再予答復。（三）海關已有進修會組織，員工福利會將予以撤銷或合併。如全體員工能接受勸導，今日或可能復工。</p>

<p>海關職工獲悉財部已允借薪一月後，昨發表書面談話，略謂：按照目前職工所得，低級職工薪津不足二十萬元，一月借款，僅值白米一石，其不能解除職工之困難，實深明顯，自不能爲我職工所接受。如待遇問題未獲澈底之改善，過去經騐所示，借薪實不足以解決問題，故爲爭取澈底改善待遇起見，我們堅特我們的三個要求，在海關當局承認福利會，改善待遇，獲確切保證以前，我們堅不復工。</p>

<h3>衛生局派員　檢視張黛琳　將遷往市立醫院考查</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕本市衛生當局對於「上海楊妹」不食之謎甚感興趣，昨日上午派市立第二醫院院長曾耀仲，衛生局科長朱雲達，藥劑師丁道餘，保健科李主任會同醫師李霖同赴華淑君女醫師處檢視。張黛琳仍力言確係九年不食，曾院長略予詢問後，認爲現時如即開始研究工作，實屬太早，第一步須先確定張女是否確係不食，完成此一步驟，須加以更嚴密之監視，故渠建議先將張女遷至市立第二警院作兩星期之考查，以確定其不食之眞實性。李華兩醫師及衛生局朱科長均表贊成，一行返衛生局請示後，如張女無異議，今日即將遷至市立第二醫院矣。曾為舞女　投浦獲救</p>
<p>關於張女身世昨已漸有揭露，張又名馮愛琴，曾在大滬舞廳爲舞女，結識一服務某銀行之徐某而賦同居，後因故於兩月前離家出走，某夜擬投浦自盡，爲張天翼救起，故張天萬並非其丈夫，僅因不食消息傳出，故將錯就錯。現衛生局及醫界方而對於張女眞而目究竟如何並不重視，蓋其身世爲一事，是否不食爲另一事，故對不貪之謎仍將繼續探索云。</p>

<h3>質詢高潮　集中公用局　七路公共汽車停駛原因　由於無票乘車越來越多</h3>
<p>昨日各局之質詢，至公用局時已臻高潮。質詢者絡繹不絕，前後有徐則　，何成甫，姜豪等多人。經趙局長分別答覆復如次：（一）公用事業四五兩月調整價格，均經參會代表審查，六月份因參會正在調查公用事業，故未便參加，故六月份先加百分之三五，至六月份爲止公用事業各種價格較戰前平均漲起廿七萬九千倍，現唯一辦法仍在設法請求中央准予外匯三月一結，减輕公用事業物料成本，俾輕市民負担。（二）南市閘北浦東電力不足，現尚向上海電力公司借電二萬三千瓩，然電力公司本身亦不够用，最近且有一發電機損壞，故南市常告斷電。（三）用電等超限罰款，除已撥給警備旅一千餘億元外，尚餘五六百億元作購買物料之用，所餘無幾，市府對此將有詳細報告提出。（四）七路公共汽車之停駛，曾經一再考慮。近因汽油來源困難，而該綫無票乘車者佔七成故祇得暫時停駛。（五）統一照會決限七月底剪完成，現尚餘二千餘輛未掉換。（六）三輪車照，因交通關係，及市政規定，無法再發。</p>
<h3>參議會等電請肅清職業學生　挽救學風擊破共匪陰謀</h3>
<p>上海市參議會，市商會，市農會，市總工會，市教育會等團體，昨聯名電呈蔣總統，李副總統，翁院長，請對各校共匪職業學生，以最嚴厲手段，迅予肅淸，安定學校，挽救學風，擘破共匪陰謀，維繫國本。其原電云：「南京總統蔣，副總統李，行政院長翁鈞鑒：竊自勝利以還，共匪稱兵叛亂，破壞統一，　傷國脈，阻障交通，致使物價飛漲，民困日深，最近復爲配合其軍事流竄，政治騷擾起見，　使多數職業學生，以反美扶日爲名，以破壞搗亂爲實，潛跡各校，對同學則蠱惑欺矇，利誘威逼，對教師則挾持侮辱，奪理橫行，鼓動風潮，呼號罷課，推演所至，舉國惶惶</p>
<p>按美國扶日，原係鑒於日本戰後國計民生之極度凋敝，基於戰勝國家應有之人道立塲，發爲救助提携之舉，如超出維持日本人民生存之限度，吾人懲前毖後，自應以合理方式，促請政府提出抗議之意見，尤應協助政府，展開外交活動，爭取友邦對中國現况之瞭解與同情，以加强援華之實施，而促進吾建國之成功，乃彼輩計不出此，盲目攻擊友邦，祗知反美扶日，而不主張扶日應有限度，祇知反美扶日，而不主張加　援華，甚且詆毀政府，破壞秩序，擾亂人心，喪失國際之同情，陷我國家於紛亂，　其用心，無非欲遂其顚覆政府之陰謀，而達其出賣國家之目的。</p>
<p>查安良必先除暴，立斷貫乎當機，政府若再優容，則今日潛匿各校之職業學生，將爲他日共匪擾亂之內綫，國家前途，亦將由其斷送，豈僅今日萬千純正青年之學業供其犧牲而已乎。本會等　察危機，痛心曷已，爰特聯電呈前，敬乞俯祭與情，迅賜轉飭教育當局，以嚴竣緊急之手段，作整肅學風之措施，前方加緊剿匪，後方必須清匪，對各校共匪職業學生，尤盼以最嚴厲方法，迅於肅清，以期安定學校，挽救學風，擊破共匪之陰謀，維擊飄搖之國本，迫切電陳，伏乞垂察採納施行爲　。上海市參議會·市商會·市農會·市總工會·市教育會。」（養）</p>
<h3>飛機用油瘋狂上漲　兩航空公司應付困難　李景璐亞滬商對策　傍晚始獲初步解決</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕本市兩航空公司因最近航空汽油價格上漲，呈無縐野馬之勢，間歇增加運價已不能應付困難，故呈請交通部速謀根本解決之辦法。茲悉交部已派航政司長李景璐來滬，正與有關主管機關縝密研究對策，其辦法據悉不出兩途：或則聽任航空遝價追蹤油價隨時自動調整，或則由政府准予各航空公司按國定匯率結匯購油，從穩定油價匪價兩項着手，進而緩和運價。按目前航空汽油問題已臻極嚴重之境地，根據航空公司統計，如以本年二月七日爲基數，則本月廿一日之油價已增至百分之一，六七三，外匯上漲百分之一，二一六，生活指數上漲百分之三五四，按航空成本計算公式，客貨運價早應增至百分之一，〇六八，但因交部靳於核准，迄今上漲不過百分之三六九，僅及應增數額三分之一强。兩航空公司全月收入，按昨日油價，已不足付一月油款一項之用，此外零件器材所需之外匯，尤爲嚴重云，</p>
<p>〔又訊〕交部航政司司長李景璐，由京來滬後，昨整日與中央銀行治商，直至傍晚始獲初步解決，中央銀行已允按照實需之汽油盒貸予一個半月之差價（依每介侖七十五萬五千元計），聞將由交通　　　担保，因此廿三日即將全面停飛之嚴重問題，已獲　時解決，今日　有各綫班搬，仍照常飛行。</p>
<h3>臨時動議</h3>
<p>推代表商汽油供應　請市銀行報告業務</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕昨日散會前，臨時動議二則：（一）張中原等提請派代表五人，參加廿三日在市府召開之商討增加汽油供應會議，以謀解決目前交通問題，決議：授權公用事業調委會決定。（二）處舜等提請市銀行報告業務狀况及確定其組織案，決定不妨排定時間，先請該行推派代表列席報告該行業務狀况，該案仍交有關小組會審查後再付討論。</p>

<h3>銀根趨勢明鬆暗緊　商品市場新價迭見</h3>

<h3>取消限價人心堅昂　食米狂漲不止</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕南北米市塲米價昨一致狂漲，平均較上週每石約漲一百萬元。除中秈限價每石不得超出一千萬元之外，其餘均經市政當局取消限價，人心堅昂異常。據社會局糧食科吉科長談稱：「取消限價之原因，由於產地價格較滬市爲高，商人無利可圖，食米輸入量减少，勢必引起米荒，而發生嚴重後果，故不得已取消限價。惟顧全升斗小民，使其能購買一千萬元以內之食米，故對中秈限價每石九百八十萬元。至供應米昨仍拋售六千石，每石仍爲九百二十萬元。民調會並派員多人赴各米店監視，以防流入黑市。」</p>
<p>昨日南市場米價：白粳一千三百二十萬元，薄稻一千三百四十萬元，早稻一千二百八十萬元，蕪秈一千一百五十萬元。北市塲米價：白粳一千三百九十萬元，薄稻一千三百七十萬元，早稻一千三百二十萬元，羊秈一千三百五十萬元。南北市塲共到米八千一百八十八石，連供應米六千石，昨日流入市塲之米爲一萬四千一百八十八石。</p>

<h3>滬市食油消費量　每月約四萬餘擔</h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿二日電〕經濟部息：據中國植物油料廠調查，上海市每月需食油量共爲四萬餘担。就上海各榨油設備而論，每月可產油十四萬噸，惟現因資金及電力等關係，僅開車三分之一，故所產食油亦僅勉敷京滬等區食用。</p>
<h3>食糖配額見增</h3>
<p>昨糖市因台公司特綿白大批標兌，趨勢初緊後軟，計配價爲一千八百萬元，共配出四萬五千二百餘包，有當日劃出，最高爲一千八百三十五萬元，最小一千七百八十萬元，算來尚須虧耗，其他上落無多。土糖微緊，升七八十萬元至一二十萬元不一，市象有轉平可能。</p>
<h3>綠茶市勢穩定</h3>
<p>最近茶葉市况，因執貨者心思不甘落後，紛起扳售，致挺勢甚鉅。尤以綠茶，除出口商對於大帮等力搜不懈外，他若本年度龍井，本街與鄉莊帮均抱來者不拒，售價益覺蓬勃。</p>
<p>茲悉：祁門紅茶，邇來本街漸擬展開胃納，從事收吸，但該貨市存欠豐，照此情形，底盤殊　固。</p>
<h3>人絲升降靡定　廠經綢貨躍升</h3>
<p>人造絲昨市忽進忽退，上落甚鉅。因銀根抽緊，人心恍惚　定，結果仍較上週六高升五千萬元之譜。一二〇號金三馬有光，上午開盤七億四千萬元，扶搖直上，最大高至八億一千萬元，午收跌至七億七千萬元賣出價。下午最小降爲七億四千萬元，收盤回升至五千三百元。</p>
<p>廠經昨市狂躍，B字等級喊價叩近十億元，惟因價過昂而買戶束手，以致交易寂寥。上午D級九億千萬元有成交，高零担做開五千萬元。千經零担喊價亦高至七億元，下午因人絲跌降，行情稍疲，惟無交易做開。</p>
<p>綢貨昨市疾升，華强眞絲被面上午開即高至三億九千五百萬元，最大做九千七百萬元，旋即降至九千萬元左右盤旋，收市又降至八千七百萬元即期價，格子壁縐棧單，開市一百四十八萬元，收市四十五萬元，下午因原料普降，塲外行情亦稍疲軟。</p>

<p>昨日棉布市况，晨開承隔日塲外俏勢，市盤均以高檔開出。十二磅龍頭細布，初開狂升一百二三十萬元，嗣因科買消息籠翠，客帮搜吸不寂。十點半許，再創一千四百九十萬元之新高價，迨聞當局有大額拋售，浮多獲利吐售，同業亦有轉賣，價乃回低至一千四百六十萬元收盤，比較假前飛漲一百六十萬元，其他各布市盤亦甚堅昂。收市後各方銀根驟緊，人心轉虛，多頭紛起斬售，塲外一致做小，龍頭布由一千四百四十萬步小至一千四百萬元有賣出，其餘各布亦較收價回降。</p>

<h3>私立大學各有傳統特性　教部採獎助政策　杭立武為光華大夏改國立事發表談話</h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿二日電〕教部次長杭立武，廿二日爲光華大夏兩大學請改國立事，發表談話稱：自復員以來，鑒於人力物力缺乏，政府決定在短期內不增設國立大學。由於經費艱難，與現有國立學校亟待充實，殊無將私立學校改爲國立之可能。以中國土地廣闊，大學若全恃國家主辦，斷難達到教育文化發展之月的，故本部對於私立大學一向採獎助培植政策。且私立大學亦各有其傳統特性，更應任其自由發展。政府在經費及其他方面，凡可協助私立學校之處，自當儘量設法。至私校學生企於國立後，即可取得公費，亦屬不可能之事，公費制度現已改爲獎學金，原未領得公費之學生，亦不能因改國立而可有公費。</p>

<h3>清華大學　現有五院廿六系　暨廿三個研究所</h3>
<p>〔本報北平〕一日航訊〕清華可能是國內最適於讀書的大學。教授，設備，校園，傳統，都是最好的。</p>
<p>淸華到今天，已經三易其名，這是民國紀元前三年用美國退還的過多的庚子賠款資送學生留美爲條件，而經過留美學務處創始的。那時僅有中等，高等二科。民國後，淸華始成爲獨立的學校。其大學基礎，到十四年才形成，是年起開始招收大一學生，這批學生畢業，結束了留美預備學校的性質，成爲一究全大學。民國十七年，國民革命軍北伐成功，經國府決議改爲國立。十八年增設了研究院，各部門設備逐漸完備。其間顏惠慶，唐國安，周貽春，羅家倫，曾先後主持過校政。現校長梅貽琦，在民國四年就已入校，就校長職則在二十年。二十一年，增設工學院，二十三年籌備辦農學院，逐漸完成了今日的規模、</p>
<p>廿六年蘆溝橋事變，淸華南遷，初則與「北大」「南開」在長沙合組臨大，廿七年遷滇，改組爲西南聯大。勝利後遷回北平，二年來的修建，恢復了淸華的舊觀。</p>
<p>淸華現在有五　　廿六系，廿三個研究所，不　在規模上堪稱爲一座完美的大學，教授尤多第一流人物。校長梅貽玲，教務長吳澤霖，訓導長褚士荃，都是國內知名學者，不必多所介紹。教授方面，文學院的馮友蘭，朱自淸，陳寅恪，吳宓，吳唸，斐文中；理學院的葉企孫，楊武之，吳有訓，陳禎，袁復禮；法學院的陳岱孫，張奚若，潘光旦；工學院的劉翻洲，施嘉煬，莊前鼎，梁思成；農學院的湯佩松，戴芳瀾，劉崇樂；體育部的馬約翰，無不是第一流的名教授。　教授治校，是淸華的傳統，最高機構是評議會，由校長以下各長組成，決定行政大計；教授會決定教課，研究事業，學風等的改進。更依校務的需要，分設有二十五個委會，此外有五個學術委會，五種學術刊物。</p>
<p>一般的批許，淸華最珍貴的，是她毫無衙門氣味的樸厚學風。學生的程度，比較整齊，都以能進清華爲幸運。教授們都在校園裏有一所小洋房住，可以安心教書，不因外間的擾亂而受影響，校方也能善體師生心情，不做過分的干預。大家都把淸華園看成自己的家，所以在清華找服務十年二十年的教職員眞是不乏其人。教授滿七年可以休假一年，下學期休假的有楊業治·余瑞璜·張印堂·徐毓枬。陶葆楷·薰樹屏·吳柳生·黃子卿，以上數人皆由校方供資赴美研究。此外在國內休假的還有朱自淸·張奚若·吳唸。休假期滿，即將回國的有劉崇樂·吳達元·范緒筠·葉楷·</p>
<p>教務長吳澤霖說：清華各部門都力求平均發展。一般的批評，則以工學院聲名較著。清華有的學系，如同社會學系，人類學系，建築工程學系，植物病理學系，農藝學系，氣象學系，都是別校沒有的。</p>
<p>淸華現在共有學生二千五百人，本年畢業的約三百人，暑假招生將不過五百人。過去畢業生的出路很好，歷屆每人都有三五個職業選擇機會。去年因時局影響，工院學生每人尚有二個機會選擇，法學院平均也有四分之一。今年則工院每人一個機會已是奢望了，其他院系就更不堪言狀。直到現在，尙少見人問津。</p>
<p>新生公費已經停發，以後只有在佔全數百分之二十的獎學金名額中爭取「公費」了。「難區」學生可以得到救濟金，此外基督教的學生公社可以輔助一部學生以工作換取飯費，學校撥給他們二十多畝地，收入可以養活幾十個人。他們今後的生活將愈來愈苦，是可以想像的。（記者宋紹柏）</p>

<h3>世運四戰四捷昨晚擊敗大公</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕世運籃球隊征滬第四戰，昨夕雖未以全力上塲，仍以五十三比四十二擊退大公，上半時廿八比十九。世運聯絡，仍無改進，僅賴個人技術取勝，各將演出，以黃天錫爲最佳，李世僑之盤傳，雖仍爲進攻之錦，惟射籃似不及前數戰出色。大公失去文華·忠强二擎天柱，實力大受影響，進攻退守，漏洞頻頻，屠文龍手風不順，遠投近射，十難一中，大公遂始終屈居下風。</p>
<p>比賽於七時十分開始，裁判王亦樵·宣鶴皐，世運文華傷手，忠强傷足，余進誤卯，以世僑·成章·志軍·天錫·松圓臨陣。大公則以蔡金典·吳慷慨·屠文能·黃柏齡·蔡連科應戰。世運得球，三記快傳，賈志軍籃下一托，先奪頭籌。天錫施出烟幕手法，亦得二分，阿弟籃下反身，成六比〇。柏齡罰得一分，爲大公開紀錄，此後世運一路領先，十六比七時，大公新將徐仲已入代連科。廿二比十相差六球時，大公三停。連科調出慷慨。上半時將終，文龍·仲已達中三元，追成十九比廿八。</p>
<p>稍息再戰，世運瑞章入塲，阿弟下野。老包托入，金典立還顏色，柏齡二度劉郎，追成廿六比卅三。大公全力反攻，柏齡神射又起，造成三十比三十五僅差五分之緊張局面，是爲大公之全盛時代。阿弟再作馮婦，替出瑞章，漸見起色，擲罰連連，戰局又穩，四十四比三十三後，鍵方演成拉鋸，保持五球上下之差額。終場比數為五十三比四十二，世運四獲勝利。</p>

<h3>綠窗夜話</h3>
<p>— 趙清閣</p>
<p>難得一個凉爽的夜晚，而又是這樣的寧靜。我數着案頭的錦聲，牠「滴滴答答向我叙述着許多如烟的往事，牠也告訴了我無限縹緲的未來。我不喜歡緬懷生事；我也不喜歡憧憬未來；我只要安定現在，因爲我是活在這個最真實的現在裏。</p>
<p>各人有各人不同的處世態度，各人有各人不同哲學　念；因此各人有各人不同的生活方式。我根據我自己一費的處世態度，哲學慨念而得「安定現在」的這個生活方式，在我是絕對心安理得，但朋友却目之爲不合潮流，太消沉了。</p>
<p>近來常有朋友直接間接的問起我，問爲什麽在任何有關文藝集曾的傷合不看見我了？問爲什麽對所有的社會活動不參加？問爲什麽連娛樂塲所都不去？還有些讀者來信，問爲什麽我的文章少發表了，是不是已經改行不寫</p>
<p>我知道朋友和讀者都是關心我，才提出這麽多疑問來詰責我。我除了衷心感謝以外，趁此凉爽而又甯靜的夜晚，坐在窗前，　着皎潔的月光，姑且打開心扉，坦白地和你們談談我這一向的情况。我不願你們誤會我，可我也並不希望你們同情我。</p>
<p>我說過，我見一個只要安定現在的人——當我發現這個世界已經沒有多少希望，個人的已往和將來都化爲了灰塵的時候，我了毅然決然採取了這麽一條相當自私的路。我這樣作，對別人旣　利署衝突，對自身却保持了乾净，賓靜。我得感激這離不開戰　的大時代，是它喚起了我靈魂　覺醒。</p>
<p>過去，在風雨飄搖的八年民族抗戰甲，我不是沒有興奮過，我　爲至高無上的理想，在砲火中獻出了我的心血，我手不停筆地寫出了千千萬萬鬥爭的文字，我和朋友們一塊參與了所有有意義的社會活動，我原是一個熱情蓬勃的人呵！</p>
<p>可是，八年以後，勝利了，國家，依然風雨飄搖！面且更加陰霾晦暗！朋友們，人心離亂，誰也不像往常那麽脈脈相關了，誰的處境都不那麽單純。文藝集會變成了空洞的應酬聚會，社曾活動永遠豪無結果。大家的理想逐漸消逝在風風雨雨裏！</p>
<p>如是我云：過去的努力化爲灰塵，以後的追求仍舊是一片灰塵。</p>
<p>鑑于此，我便只有安定現在。我摒除一切明知都將成爲灰塵的英雄意念，把精神情緒使之出世化，把心身恬淡地生活在唯我獨尊的領域裏。</p>
<p>與事無爭；與人無爭；然求少，煩憂便少。響如最近房東控告我，逼我遷出，我唯聽憑法律處分我懶得耗費精力去和脅迫者週旋。米麵漲價了，我反正是習慣素食的，蔬菜粗飯還可以免强靠一枝筆糊口，只有香烟貴了，我才感到傷腦筋！戒吧，十幾年了，不容易，也太虐待自己；而且靈感攸關。不戒吧，牠比伙食費還大。因此這兩天香烟問題的確苦惱了我。</p>
<p>跳舞，我玩過陣子，後來我覺得那只能像喝酒，偶然醉一次還可以，常常醉就沒意思。倒不如看看好電影有益處。否則，甯肯一個人摸摸骨牌，「過五關」，「擒孟獲」把一天的疲她都能够忘了。</p>
<p>誰說我不寫文章了呢？在我還沒有學到其他生活技能以前，我是不會改行的。但我不大隨便發表是眞的。賣一部稿子能够維持些日子了，這時期我便專門寫我自己喜愛的東西，不管出版家將來接受不接受，我只要自己看着過　。</p>
<p>就道樣，我現在生活得很安定—而且我就把握住這個「現在」的「安定」。</p>
<p>所謂「合乎測流」，在這是非不明，倒行逆施的時勢下，是沒有標準的。潮流在向着一條民主和平的道路邁進，而野心人們偏以背道而馳爲然。你逼直走嗎？前面荆棘業叢。你也趨炎附勢嗎？良心不許。于是你只有適中而止，效法古人「明哲保身一之道。</p>
<p>我不否認我這種處世態度有些消沉，然而我的豪氣到那裏去了呢？被無限殘酷的事實磨滅了—那些殘酷的事實，宛如蛆蟲，成年累月地蠶食着我的生命力，使我疲於再和製造殘酷事實的魔鬼抗衡了！但，我的消沉，誰又能知道不是一種修養；一種忍耐；一種養精蓄銳呢？因此我不承認我的消沉就是屈服，甚而是恥辱。</p>
<p>我常常想：緘默未始不是一種無聲的報復，我連牢騷都不願發了，我厭惡目前的一切現實，厭惡到不屑於再聞問，我把思想情緒超脫到另外一個境界中去，我要從深度的愛憎裏自拔出來，爲了安定現在—</p>
<p>聲永遠一滴答個不休，牠一面努力地推送黑夜，一面却積極地把明天往近處拉攏，但是牠自己也不能明白，這中間究竟有着多麼遠的距離？牠好似一四盲了的馬，永遠奔馳在無盡止的深淵裏，奔馳向世界的末日。</p>
<p>靜穆中我又　見我的心也像鐘聲一樣「滴答」「滴答」地響着，響得那麼均勻，那麼和平，而又都是那麼沒有休止地，響着！響着—直至我的末日來臨。</p>
<p>月亮鑽進雲　裏去了，夜已深沉！</p>
<p>任鐘聲伴着這顆心繼續滴答着吧，我的絮語却要在這裏結束了。</p>
<p>（卅七年端陽後五日）</p>
<h3>由楊妹想起的</h3>
<p>— 謝冰瑩</p>
<p>說起來，眞有點難爲情，楊妹九年不食，大家認爲是世界一大奇蹟，於是山主席到醫生，護士，學者，名流以不販夫走卒，都在注意這一新聞，還更不知有若干人在想變成楊妹第二。其實，不吃飯能活，算不得一回什麼了不得的事，我們不是常常在報紙上看到已故聖堆甘地絕食的新聞嗎？他常常一絕食就是十幾二十天，那時為什麼沒有人研究甘地不食，怎麼可以生活？而且精神正常，和平時一樣他還可以看公事，處理一切日常事情？</p>
<p>在我十多歲的時候，常看見有許多從新化縣或者寶慶府的人步行到南嶽衡山去進香，有還血盆香的，有還麝香的，有還喪香的，（生前因病許的香，人死後，仍須還願。）有一種呌做「餓香」的最特別，進香的人，不論男女老少，從出發的前夕，一直到他回來的那天，不管其中經過多少日子，絕不能嚐一點東西，甚至連店家的冷水也不能喝，他們每人有一個像酒杯大的水杓子插在頸上，遇到什麼地方有瀑布，或者是特別淸潔的泉流，他們就用杓子盛點水喝，一點都感覺不到飢餓，而且和其他的人一樣每天能跑八九十里路，最難得的是有些五六十歲的老太婆，一雙裏着三寸金蓮的小脚，她不吃東西，居然也能跑八九十里路。在她們看來，自然一切都有菩薩在保佑。當時最流行一個這樣的故事：有一個于年人去南嶽還餓香，走到半路，實在俄的不能忍受了，他在路上偸摘了一顆桃子吃，不料桃子剛進口咬碎，這人就大吐起來，隨即身死。在他的旁邊，這些吐川來的碎桃子，突然變成了一顆完整的，使過路的人看了，知道他是爲了偸食而暴卒。</p>
<p>自然，這是百分之百的迷信，絕對不可靠的！但還餓香的人不吃東西，這是鐵一般的事實，正如那些還拜香的人，有的三步一跪，五步一拜，這麼麻煩，這麼辛苦的動作，他居然一步也不亂，也不感覺疲勞，而且走起來並不比別人慢，有時他們還比普通人走的快。遇到還拜香的人走過，孩子們特別高興去看，因爲他們的服裝特殊，頭上紮着靑布，繫以紅帶，胸前帶着紅兜兜，下跪與起來的動作特別快，好像蜻蜓點水似的那麽輕，那麼迅忽，他們每人手裏拿着一條插香的小凳，都潦的紅潦，好玩極了。鄉里人說這些還香的人，都是因爲菩薩在顯靈，所以他們不飢餓，不疲倦。其實這完全是精神作用，我們如果從許多科學家，藝術家的傳記來看，他們常常爲了一心一意貫注在一個什麼問題上面，就會廢寢忘餐的。抗戰時期，有多少士兵在前綫上一連三四天吃不到一粒米，喝不到一口水，他們一樣在前綫射擊敵人，一樣衝鋒陷陣，人是能應付環境的，到了沒有吃的時候，他可以不吃，到了需要留險的時候，胆量也就特別大起來了。</p>
<p>我國是個封建勢力支配社會最久的國家，所以對於不吃能生存，有種種說法，我會在華山的毛女洞看到一位十年不吃飯的老道，他的辟穀，是想脫離烟火，變做神仙。已經七十多歲了，看起來只像個五十多歲的，身體很結實，險上的皮膚也與常人一樣，並不顯得特別貧血或者憔悴。他吃的是樹上的菓子和地下的蕨草之類。核桃，松子，華參，這幾類都是華山的特產，每年出產，除了很少的一部份供給辟穀的老道吃以外，售與遊客的，至少也在三四千斤以上。我們的科學家，早就應該研究一不，光只吃這些植物，爲什麽同樣可以長壽呢？</p>
<p>最後，我想說一說我自已飢餓的經驗。第一次在上海藝大讀書時，因爲窮，我餓了三天，祗喝自來水，什麼東西都未曾入口；第二次在法國巡捕房，也是整整三天沒吃一顆飯，沒喝一滴水，據我的經驗，不吃飯還可以忍受，不喝水，簡直要命！尤其在夏天，水，就是生命的泉源，離開水，這人就與的會乾死了！在日本坐牢的時候，我有一星期不吃飯，每天只喝一小杯水，眼睜睜地看到同囚室的犯人吃得津津有味，我却視若無睹，一點也不一動食慾，爲什麼我那時要絕食呢？一方面因爲他們用那些發了霉的米煮成的飯，實在不能下嚥，加之放在便當上的那一條臭魚，更使我一見就作嘔；我請求他們給我吃麵包，他們置之不理，我就賭氣不吃：一來向他們示威，二來我也很想把自己做一個試驗究竟可以多少日子不吃飯，能不能餓死？萬一餓死了，省得日本帝國主義再來侮辱我，槍殺我，不正好嗎？在這七天裏，我因爲原來就有胃病，所以一點不感到飢餓的壓迫，最難忍受的是口渴，想喝水—有時乾得喉喉嚨裏冒出火來，似乎腸子都要被火燒斷了，這時候，如果有人給我一杯溝渠裏的污水，甚至別人的小便，也許會不顧一切地喝下去的。</p>
<p>提到科學，我是外行，同時也替我們的科學家着急！已經一個多月了，爲什麼對於楊妹還沒有研究出一點什麼門路來呢？尤其我很奇怪楊主席只管注意楊妹不食的問題，而忽視四川省的窮苦老百姓沒有飯吃的問題。正寫到道裏，報差送報來了，重慶搶米風潮的消息，登在北平日報的第一版當中，還有一篇社論，這不僅只是重慶的嚴重問題，也是全國各地的嚴重問題，我希望所有研究楊妹的科學家，政治家，學者名流，如果研究不出一個所以然來，趁早放棄楊妹，讓她恢投自由，過她的本來生活，而把眼光轉過來落在三萬萬以上的窮老百姓身上吧，要怎樣才能使他們生存？我以爲這是中國目前唯一的最大的問題！（三七，六，十八於故都）</p>

<p>— 趙景深</p>
<p>安諾德的新研究</p>
<p>英國大批評家安諾德（Mathew　Arnold）在維多利亞時代，除狄更司外，是最值得我們注意的，他到現在還活在我們的心中。他被許多人研究着。關於他的評傳是不會怎樣失敗的。他個人的生活很沉悶，幾乎無可叙述，所以作評傳的人都集中在他的思想介紹上或節引他的文章，那就不會沉悶了。過去我們雖有崔（Lionel　Trilling）使人滿意的精細研究曾得到過森次巴立（Ssintsbury）的同情和讚許，又有丁克爾（C．B.Tinker）和羅雷（Howard　F.Lowry）的繼續研究，我們對於新出的兩本安諾德的研究還是不嫌太多。</p>
<p>凑巧這兩位撰述人的名字編寫都是K.E.他們倆把作爲人，詩人和思想家的安諾德各方面都叙述到了。張　斯（Chamhers）的一本僅一四四面，是牛津大學出版部出版的，提供了許多文獻上的日期，數字，宗諩之類。白朗（Brown）的一本則作深人的觀察，認爲安諾德畢生都在玄想與行動的鬥爭之中。</p>
<p>張伯斯僅只作文學上的探討。他是事件的勤勉的　集者。但這本醫雖充滿了日期和宗譜，却不是傳記。約分爲安諾德的少年時代，公僕，詩人，教授，哲學家，晚年，人格等章。可惜他把讀者估計得太低，比方說，特別指出愛瑪生是美國人，斯賓那莎是十七世紀的哲學家，或雅禮大學是在美國什麼地方，這些對於想研究安諾德的人都是不必要的。即偶發議論，亦覺平凡。例如說他的劇　勝過坏情詩，客觀重於主觀之類。</p>
<p>白朗則浸潤於安諾德者甚深。他能够毫不費力地把握住安諾德的全部。學究式的詳細註釋，也是值得讚美的。文筆嫻雅，主題淸晰。白朗又談到安諾德的「沒利害觀念」或「無所容心的態度」（Diisntdrsdtness）。這種態度是人類生活最好的態度。安諾德是一個最火的吸收者，像蜜蜂在遙遠的田地裏採取蜜蠟一樣。民主應該吸收文化，文化也應該吸收民主。總之，他盡了他最大的努力吸收最好的東西.他反對地方主義。因了他，英國文學的趣味　廣泛的開展起來。</p>

<h3>白米折現房東肆虐　月租五斗小費十石　屋荒聲中的小民苦痛</h3>
<p>楊月笙問　敝友於卅六年一月問向某甲租得住屋一間·合同上書明敝友須先付小費六十萬元，按月租金白米五斗，折合市價付款，租期三年，水電自理。後因食米官價與黑市時有出入，往往發生糾葛。最近又因米價折現發生糾紛，雙方各執一詞不肯相讓。茲有法律疑問數則，請賜答爲感！（一）照上述情形，房租照米價計算，是否合法？折價時應按照何種米價折現？（二）本月一日報載市參議會議決之房租案，按廿六年份房租之七千與九千倍計算，請問敝友所住之房屋能否享同等權利？（三）合同上載明敝友須先小小費六十萬元，該款當時可購米十石能否控其不當利得，並要求作爲預付二十個月之租金？</p>
<p>〔唐鳴時律師答〕　（一）小費遠禁，實物收租亦不合法。契約上米價，通常往往依微信所刊行之米價爲準。（二）參會議決之房租最高價，乃訂定租金之尺度，已成契約，若一律取消，重新改訂，似非維持秩序之至意；恐難免涉訟也。（三）小費不能成立，可以抵作租金。</p>

<h3>靈感</h3>
<p>— 朱石麟</p>
<p>我有過幾次這樣的經騐：當我被某一人生的難題所困時，往往無論怎樣左衝右突都不能衝出重圍，而且越是努力越是鑽進牛角尖，弄到後來精疲力竭，實在沒有勇氣再奮鬥，看看只好受命運的支配了；偶然，夜半醒來，在寂寞人靜的時候，忽然一個衝動，像閃光似地在腦海中掠過，試把牠老慮一下，覺得這個念頭正是對付目前困難最理想的辦法。當時非常詫異，爲什麼在日間竟愚蠶地想不到呢？後來到底靠這一剎那古怪的念頭，解決了我的難題。相信讀者一定也有過類似的經騐。</p>
<p>天才與常人在智力上的差異極微細，甚至是相等的，但是天才爲什麼是少數中的少數，而大部份的人終是碌碌以沒呢？當然環境和教育是重要的因素，不過最有決定性的在天才能當靈感來臨時，立刻抓住，加以利用。常人也有靈感，不過往往自以爲牠是可笑的幻想而棄如敝屣，否則今日世界的文明，決不止此。</p>
<p>譬如說，那位「探險家」雷諾雖是個大滑頭，其一生無時不在冒險和投機中翻觔斗，但是他把握時機與果敢決斷的性格，確是出類拔萃的。否則，一個窮光蛋怎能爬到現在的地位呢？據說這次來華探險，完全利用探險機可以不受檢查而從事走私，而旦推說飛機油箱漏油，再來一次「野人頭」，結果在這「冒險家的樂園」裏發了一次洋財。這種念頭豈是他人所想得出！無論他的行爲是否正當，總是他靈機一動的表現。再舉一例：在愛迪生傳記的影片裏，愛迪生爲了試驗燈泡，曾用千百種物質試作燈絲，都沒有滿意的結果：連續不斷的工作和失敗，使他心力交瘁，終至由失望而灰心。突然他看見助手的滿頰于思于思，一個古怪的念頭來了，他很快的拔一根下米作爲他的試驗品，坷惜還是不能用—否則，靈感又創造了一個奇蹟。</p>
<p>靈感完全得之偶然，無可强求。牠存在在潛意識中，難得出現一次，往往在外界沒有騷擾且心地甯靜的時候。釋迦牟尼爲了追求生·老·病·死的眞諦，在菩提樹下冥思了數十年，毫無結果，最後靈感來臨，苦苦尋求的解答得之一旦。每個人都有這種可能，問題在對牠怎樣看法。如果能把握牠，利用牠，個人將米的成就是會連自已都不能相信的。</p>
<h3>創作與靈感</h3>
<p>— 蓮湖</p>
<p>哥德在二十三歲時，曾鍾情於一位已許過人的女子夏綠蒂，煩悶無計排解，正謀自殺，忽聞友人失戀自殺的消息，彷彿突然見到一閃靈光，從眼前弊過，立刻就把「少年維特的煩惱」全書綱要想好，他一口氣寫下去，不到兩個星期便完成了。然後把稿子覆閱一遍，自己覺得很詫異，因爲他絲亳沒有費力。他說：「這部小冊子好像是一個患睡行症的人在昏迷中寫成的。」</p>
<p>音樂家裴理奧替員讓潔的一五月五日」詩譜樂曲，譜到煞尾的疊句：「可憐的兵士，我終於要再見法蘭西」時，猛然停住，再四思索，終於想不出一段樂調來傳達道疊句的情思，過了兩年，他遊羅馬，有一天失足落在河裏，遇救沒有淹死，他出水時口裏所唱的一段樂調，就是兩年之前再四搜索而不能得的。</p>
<p>音樂家華格桌在「萊茵河的黃金」三部曲完成之時，仍沒有想出它的開塲調，他乘船過海，畫夜不能安眠。有一天午後，他倦極纔得微睡，彷彿覺得自己沉在急流裏面，聽到流水往復澎湃的聲音，自成一種樂調，醒後他便根據在夢中所聽得急流的聲音，譜成三部曲的開塲調。</p>
<p>英國詩人柯勒律琪的「忽必烈汗」，也是夢境中的作品，他本來嗜鴉片，有一天醉後，坐在椅上睡着，臨睡前他在一本遊記裏讀到「忽必烈汗令在此地建一座宮殿，並且修一個堂皇的花園，於是一道圍墻把十里肥沃的土地都圍在裏面」這一句話。在三刻鐘的熟睡中，他夢見根據這個典故做成二三百行詩，剛醒時他還記得淸楚，於是取紙筆把它趕快寫下，寫到數十行時，忽然有客來訪，把他的思路打斷了。客去後則夢中所見已模糊隱約，不能續寫，他所寫下來的五十三行爲他的全集中三傑作之一。</p>
<h3>石屋煙霞兩洞紀游</h3>
<p>— 半蒙老人</p>
<p>西湖無大洞，惟玉皇山紫來洞，比較稍深廣，餘雖有名，大都容量狹小。一日，余由紫雲洞下山，步行過跨虹橋，訪曲院風荷亭，亭外舊稱岳湖，植荷甚少，湖邊亦無曲院，可云名不副實。過橋後，南行；一路經東浦望山壓隄鎖瀾映彼五橋，合跨虹爲六橋，隄上風景至佳，除路過之汽車人力車外，游人極少，隄邊均有石磴可坐，於垂柳和風中靜坐移時，俗塵煩惱盡洗，爲之留連不忍去。</p>
<p>渦蘇隄後，有南泠亭，坐石欄上，探同憩者以石屋洞地址，據答須由汽車路到赤山埠入山，乃即從汽車大道行，過四眼井亭，折而向西北抵大仁寺。寺後即石屋洞，房屋煥然一新，寺門外有石屋亭，洞內左方有石別院，一小洞也。右方有小洞，口闊而底狹，如一螺形，題日「滄海浮螺」，螺則似矣，惟「滄海」二字尚無著落。甕雲洞却妙；石屋洞之上，尚有乾坤洞，不能成爲洞，乾坤二字，更屬不經。石屋洞中之佛像，塑法甚佳；大可一觀。</p>
<p>出大仁寺後，由右折西行，即爲滿覺隴，此中不過三五村落，向以桂花著名，有上滿覺隴下滿覺隴之分，然山勢殊爲緊凑，南高峯項上之屋，兀然在望，一路行至短垣環繞處，入門，即水樂洞也。水樂洞，其形亦如螺，愈深愈狹，有僧懸牌募化，以提燈引人入勝，但行至洞底，別無可觀。水樂洞之水，却甚淸澈可飲，往年余游水樂洞時，聞四壁汨汨有聲，今則無之，以天久不雨故。</p>
<p>永樂洞無可觀，出門，登高峯，中途有亭曰半亭，休息片時，再上，即至烟霞洞矣。烟霞洞滿壁鑿羅漢像，計有十八尊，另有大佛彌勒觀音等像。羅漢像雕刻甚精，各俱態度，洞口有碑，大書「烟霞此地多」五字。洞之右方，有蘇老石　，建築奇古，在洞外平地遠觀，高下皆山，胸　爽朗。</p>
<p>洞旁烟霞寺，聞素菜甚佳，爲山寺第一。余來時，寺已殘破，入寺遍觀，不見一僧，但有一女郎，坐作家事，亦不招待游人，或係僧衆眷屬。（編者按：「僧衆眷屬」四字似頗新穎。）當時游洞者，除余外不見一人，淸净而寂寞，洞外亦祗攝影師一人，張其價目廣告牌，以俟游客。所謂臥獅吸江陟記諸亭，均未見之，下方有老媼張布篷賣茶，茶味淸冽可口，以此想見刧後之蕭條。</p>
<p>烟霞洞地處甚佳，自當爲西湖各洞之冠，但今烟霞寺無正當僧人管理，勝景日就荒蕪，滋可惋惜。口占得句云：「石康精凝亦自奇，烟霞高古起予思，無端邱　胸中滿，且撥蒼藤擷紫芝。」由洞西行，可到龍井，然時已晏，龍井之游，祗可俟諸異日矣。</p>
<h3>「藏六」</h3>
<p>— 繆子彬</p>
<p>昨讀半夢老人靈隱紀遊云，放生池下有石洞，名曰藏六洞，不解所謂「藏六」二字。按「藏六」二字見阿含經：「有龜被野干（獸名）所包，藏六而不出，野干怒而捨去。佛告諸比丘，當如龜自藏六根，魔不得便。」蓋龜能自縮其首尾四足，故曰藏六。靈隱藏六洞之義，應即本此。東坡寄傲軒詩有句云，得如虎挾乙，失若龜藏六。淸姚惜抱亦有句云，此身未作龜藏六，擾擾人間同一局，則皆用作避世意。而今人每詈人輒曰六縮，即以龜喻，其實古人並不諱龜，以龜字作名號者甚多，而以人况龜者，更不勝枚舉也。</p>

<p>以漫駡譏嘲詛咒發洩怨憤的是庸人，以憎恨對付憎恨的是勇士。而以友愛償付憎恨的，却需要更大的勇敢。</p>
<h3>記黃摩西</h3>
<p>— 錢大成</p>
<p>章太炎都講東吳大學日，與常熟黃麼西最稱莫逆，兩人共語恒達旦。摩西病在卒，其子又殺人，匿太炎所，太炎多方爲之庇護，恤其故人之子無微不盡。世因知摩西亦非常人也。</p>
<p>摩西原名振聲，後要名人，字慕菴，摩西其別字也。其父隱於賈，然好老莊之學，撰道家言一卷。摩西爲文，洋洋數千言，奇氣溢紙，不矜細行，晝則馳馬爲狹斜游，夜方讀書，或彌月不寢，或一夕作詩數十篇。教授東吳大學日，輯中國文學史二十九帙，篇幅之巨，並世無兩，藏大學圖書館。亂中不知曾否散失？尤善填詞，盡和龔定蓋張皋文蔣劍人所製，燕谷老人序而刊行之，稱：「其奧如子，其怨如騷，其空寂如禪，其幽渺如鬼，其冶蕩如素女，說不可說之言，達不能達之意，寄無可寄之情，如游絲之裊於長空，不知所住，而亦無不住。」又云：「黃子摩西學博而遇嗇，其所爲詞，曷爲使予然而悲，幽然而思，如見悄黃子毿毿短髮，披拂項背，負手微吟於殘燈曲屏間。……」摩西倚調鳳棲梧自題其詞集云：「寸心萬古情魔宅，積淚如河積恨如山疊；願遺美人都化月，山河留影無生滅。月墜西頭終費覓，后羿長窮羞受純狐憶；飛上靑天無氣力，彩吃一擲長虹直。」晚歲搜羅宋元以來工於詞而不顯者得二百餘家，欲刻以傳世，造病狂數月，以生平珍藏書籍撕毀殆盡。吳江金松岑稱摩西之傳奇倚聲，與吳梅伯仲；二子又友好無間，摩西於律度不能沈細，若豐文逸態，往往駕吳梅而上。梅後逝，儼然爲詞曲學大師，摩西身名俱泯，世鮮知之者。金叔遠先生與摩西同事三年，嘗勸其著述，摩西嘆曰：「我日暮途窮，無能爲已！」蓋其心中固有難言之恫，雅不欲流溺區區文字之海，以圖身後之微名也。金松岑列摩西於蘇州五奇人傳，謂摩西才而疑。或謂其人奇文奇而死亦奇，無往而不奇，則其遇亦奇已。</p>
<p>###</p>
<p>署期已屆，各大學畢業人多，如何繼「學業」而有「職業」，成爲相當嚴重的問題。原來「畢業即是失業」之苦悶，呼籲已經多年，不自今始，而今所以更因難者，交通之被破壞，阻塞益多，各處已成建設之摧毀或廢棄，要區重地情形之變遷，例如前昨兩夏往關外就職者時有所聞，今年則只見東北的人往關內遷轉，絡繹不絕。由此推想及於各處，並略爲省察破壞多於建設之現象，即知離校以後，實不能無感於前路之茫茫。</p>
<p>大學生在原則上應以學術爲目的，所謂「爲學術而學術」，爲最高學府之眞諦，所以別於專門學校之造就實用人才，尤其職業學校之「爲職業而學業」者不同。此原則自「五門遝動　新文化展開，學制改革以後，始大白於天下。故大學畢業而亟亟於求職，似與學府立塲不合。而事實所在，生計所迫，仍不能盡符本旨，衣食足而後知榮辱」一句老話，依然有味。即志在研究，力能發明，而枴腹從公，總是不可能。即使國力能供養大學研究生，亦難遍及各校畢業之多數。所以職業與學業的聯系之密切，亦勢有必至，理有固然。歷年各校，不論大學或專門，每屆畢業之前一二月，校中註冊課即分別準備名冊，文牘課即準備薦引稿，向各相當職業或技術應用之機關詢問推薦，以便一出校門，即有安身之處。平均計算，工業需材最亟，學工者安插較易，其他各科系只要時局安定，秩序照常，總不致全無著落，僅爲多寡遲速之不同，而今則難言矣。</p>

<h3>Joint Military-Civilian Effort to Defend Kaifeng; Core Strongholds Still Firmly Held; President Flew from Zhengzhou to Xi'an Yesterday</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Xi'an, 22nd] The President has now flown to Xi'an. Director Hu Zongnan, Deputy Director Gao Guizi, Chairman Wang Zongshan, Senior Advisor Shi Jingting, Xi'an Garrison Commander Cao Rihui, and others were all at the airport to greet him.</p>
<p>[Our Dispatch, Xuzhou, 22nd] The defending troops of Kaifeng are still firmly holding key positions today, including Henan University, the Catholic Church, and Longding.</p>
<p>[Our Dispatch, Nanjing, 22nd] According to a military news dispatch from Zhengzhou at 7:00 PM on the 22nd: The fighting within Kaifeng City seemed to have quieted down on the afternoon of the 22nd. According to an air force report, apart from sporadic artillery fire near the strongholds, the battle situation was not as intense as in previous days. The bandits are looting supplies. On the 22nd, large military trucks transporting goods south through the Chichangzhen area south of Kaifeng were continuously traveling, but many were bombed and destroyed by the air force. Fierce fighting is currently taking place in areas 30 to 50 li outside of Kaifeng. Reinforcements are arriving at the outskirts of the city. It seems the bandits are withdrawing south to avoid encirclement, due to the powerful Nationalist army corps attacking from Lanfeng and Zhongmu in separate routes. Although telecommunications within the city are currently interrupted, it is generally believed that important strongholds are still firmly held by the Nationalist army.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Xuzhou, 22nd] The Battle of Kaifeng reached its most intense stage on the 22nd. The Nationalist army and Henan provincial security forces, who are resolutely defending the northwest of the city walls in the area of Henan University, Longting, the Iron Pagoda, the sports field, and the Catholic Church, continued to display their tenacious and extraordinary spirit before 5:00 PM today, engaging in the sixth day of bayonet-to-bayonet bloodbath with the bandits. A portion of the strong, middle-aged civil servants and residents in the city also volunteered to join the front lines, demonstrating a high degree of military-civilian cooperation, making the greatest and final efforts to defend this ancient city of the Central Plains. Since last night, the bandits have concentrated their entire force, launching repeated fierce charges against the defenders' positions using human wave tactics. The military and civilians who are resolutely defending the various strongholds in the northwest of the city walls are not discouraged by the small number of people and the limited area. Relying on the existing fortifications, they fought bravely, losing and regaining ground repeatedly. Since this morning, the sounds of fighting in the northwest of the city walls have shaken the sky, and the battle has become increasingly fierce. As of 5:00 PM this afternoon, the fighting was still in a state of melee.</p>

<h3>Legislative Yuan to Hold Provisional Meeting Tomorrow to Review the Central Plains Campaign</h3>
<p>Request that He Yingqin attend and report</p>
<p>[Our Dispatch, Nanjing, 22nd] In the afternoon session of the Legislative Yuan on the 22nd, a provisional motion proposed by Zheng Zhenyu and others was passed, resolving to convene a provisional meeting on the 24th to review the reasons for and responsibilities for the setbacks in the Central Plains campaign. The Minister of National Defense, He Yingqin, was requested to attend and report and be prepared to answer questions. When explaining the case, Zheng pointed out that the Kaifeng battle was due to incorrect pre-battle judgments, poor temporary dispatching, and the inability of local commanders to command. All units above the regiment level had to be directly commanded by the central government, coupled with unclear rewards and punishments, and confusion between right and wrong, which allowed the communists to take advantage. We should thoroughly review this to benefit all future military campaigns. Furthermore, the review meeting on the 24th is considered a military secret, and reporters are not allowed to attend.</p>

<h3>Several Key Members of the Kuomintang Gather; Sincerely Hope for Cooperation Between the Three Parties; Decide to Find Ways to Incrementally Increase the Number of Seats for Youth Party Legislators</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch, Nanjing, 22nd] Because Kuomintang President Chiang Kai-shek was on inspection on the 21st, the seven opinions submitted by the Youth Party through Lei Zhen had not been reviewed. Several key members of the Kuomintang, including Wu Tiecheng, conducted preliminary research at the Central Party Headquarters at 9:00 PM on the 22nd. In addition to continuing to step up efforts on the issue of the number of seats for Youth Party legislators, and finding ways to incrementally increase them, for the remaining points, either due to the constitutional political system and party relations being different from before, or due to the fact that it is difficult to determine a deadline for their achievement, it is necessary to wait for the President to return to Beijing to ask for instructions before conducting further research. However, those who attended all had extremely sincere hopes for cooperation between the three parties, and especially hoped that the Youth Party could recommend candidates for Grand Justice and Examination Committee members within the next two to three days, so that the President could nominate them as soon as possible. Lei Zhen has already been entrusted to send a letter to Youth Party members regarding this process.</p>
<h3>Jia Jingde Will Take the Position of Vice President of the Examination Yuan</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch, Nanjing, 22nd] The President originally intended to delay the appointment of Yu Jiaju of the Youth Party to the position of Vice President of the Examination Yuan. Now, because the Youth Party insists that it does not intend to consider submitting candidates to participate in the government until the seven conditions proposed by the party have been agreed to, it was decided on the 22nd that Jia Jingde, the former Minister of Personnel, would take the position. Shi Zhiquan will remain the Vice President of the Judicial Yuan. The nominations for the Presidents and Vice Presidents of the Examination and Judicial Yuan can be sent by the Presidential Office to the Control Yuan so that the Yuan can immediately convene a meeting to exercise its power of consent.</p>
<h3>Legislative Yuan Passes Resolution to Accept $400 Million in US Aid; Authorizes Government to Negotiate Bilateral Agreements</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch, Nanjing, 22nd] At the meeting of the Legislative Yuan on the morning of the 22nd, after listening to Foreign Minister Wang Shijie's report on the US Aid to China Act and his answers to the questions raised by various committee members, the Legislative Yuan passed a resolution with 337 votes (out of 394 committee members present) to accept the total of $400 million in aid, authorizing the government to negotiate and sign formal bilateral agreements with the United States, and to properly use the US aid.</p>
<h3>Foreign Minister Wang Reports on the Negotiations for US Aid</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch, Nanjing, 22nd] The 14th meeting of the first session of the Legislative Yuan was held at 9:20 AM on the 22nd. After Chairman Sun Ke read out the report items and passed the minutes of the previous meeting, Foreign Minister Wang reported on matters related to US aid. He first reviewed the negotiations with the United States since last summer, briefly stating: Initially, it was intended to obtain a loan from the Washington Export-Import Bank, but this type of commercial loan that requires repayment was not suitable for providing our country with aid for large-scale planned construction, so there were no results. It was not until October 27 that a small-scale political Sino-US Relief Agreement was signed, under which the United States successively allocated $45 million in accordance with the Foreign Aid Act of 1947 to supply food rationing to our country's five major cities in the nature of relief. At that time, the US side had already indicated that, depending on the urgency of the world situation, there would be a large-scale aid to Europe plan. With the help of all parties, the aid to China plan was also drafted at the same time. After the two cases were submitted to the US Congress, the principle that aid to China must also aid Europe and that the two cases must be established simultaneously was decided. Therefore, on April 3 of this year, the US House and Senate passed an overall foreign aid bill. However, the bill only stipulated the maximum amount of aid funds. The exact amount still had to await the approval of the Congressional Appropriations Committee by both houses. Therefore, the amount has recently been reduced again through this procedure. Secondly, the Foreign Minister also explained that our country's purposes for negotiating aid with the United States are divided into four points: (1) The excess of cotton, oil, rice, and grain imports is caused by the current domestic economic situation, so foreign aid is needed to balance foreign exchange. (2) The maintenance and development of morning and industry requires foreign aid. (3) The supply of military materials requires foreign aid. (4) The reserve fund for currency system reform especially requires special privileges.</p>
<h3>Our Self-Help Plan Will Be Submitted After the Agreement is Signed</h3>
<p>The first three of these four goals have received US support. However, regarding the fourth item, currency system reform, the United States believes that it is still difficult to discuss it within the first 12 months of aid. The amount of aid stipulated in the US Aid to China Act has now been determined to be a total of $400 million, to be used within one year from the date the bill was established on April 3 of this year. Among them, $125 million in special aid does not need to be repaid, and we can use it to purchase military supplies. The remaining $275 million in economic aid, except for $60 million in special construction loans, can also be expected to be provided as a gift. However, this $60 million was still decided when the total amount had not been reduced. Now that the total amount has been reduced by as much as $63 million, our country will negotiate with the United States to proportionately reduce this special construction loan. Regarding the use of this US aid, the Foreign Minister reiterated that the ten principles personally drawn up by former President Zhang of the Executive Yuan are still sufficient for use, and a self-help plan will be submitted after the Sino-US bilateral agreement is signed. He also explained that the $50 million that the United States first allocated after the passage of the bill has already been used in accordance with the exchange of letters between our Ambassador Gu and the US Secretary of State on April 30. Aid materials are already on the way. The use of all US aid funds must be subject to a bilateral agreement signed by the two countries before July 3, otherwise all aid to China affairs will be suspended. Therefore, it is urgently hoped that the Legislative Yuan can accept the aid to China case as soon as possible so that agreements can be concluded. As for the specific plans for using US aid, the various competent departments are actively formulating them, and US representatives are also cooperating in investigating resources that can be developed in various places, and will be listed separately in the budget and submitted to the Legislative Yuan for review.</p>
<h3>Chen Yi Will Immediately Go to Hangzhou to Take Office; Visited Wang Yunwu Yesterday to Discuss Zhejiang Province's Finances; Shen Honglie Prepares to Hand Over and Go to Taiwan to Recuperate</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch, Nanjing, 22nd] The newly appointed Chairman of Zhejiang Province, Chen Yi, visited Finance Minister Wang Yunwu at 5:00 PM on the 22nd to discuss Zhejiang Province's financial problems. He left after talking for more than twenty minutes. Chen also visited Weng Wenhao, He Yingqin, Shao Lizi, and others on the 21st and 22nd, and will go to Zhejiang to take office in two or three days.</p>
<p>[Our Dispatch, Hangzhou, 22nd] Because Chairman Shen happened to be changing personnel before the end of the year, he specially telegraphed Chen Yi to come to Hangzhou to take office as soon as possible.

Among the new government committee members, the People's Party and the Youth Party each occupy one person.</p>
<h3>200 Tons of Military Supplies Purchased by Us from Belgium Transported to Guangdong via Hong Kong</h3>
<p>[United Press, Hong Kong, 22nd] Today's newspaper reported that in addition to purchasing military supplies from the United States and Canada, China is also purchasing from European countries. Recently, 200 tons of small arms and bullets purchased from Belgium are being transported to the Guangdong Provincial Government via Hong Kong.</p>
<h3>The Latter US Aid Will Be Visible in Early Spring</h3>
<p>At the end of his report, the Foreign Minister clearly indicated: The subsequent aid will be visible in early spring. He said: China should not completely rely on foreign countries, and should strive to implement self-help plans to cooperate with the full utilization of aid. The US foreign aid plan was originally scheduled for four years. Although Congress only passed a one-year measure, it is still continuous. If our country achieves remarkable results in using this aid during this one year, when the US Congress discusses this matter again next spring, we will naturally have better conditions to obtain more aid.</p>
<p>After Foreign Minister Wang finished his report, Xiao Zheng, Wu Tiecheng, and others believed that it was not necessary to submit it for review, and that the Yuan should discuss it directly. Chen Guyuan, Jiang Yiping, and others expressed their opposition, believing that this matter was of great importance, and that it was a report item and should be submitted for review according to the agenda. After a vote, with 392 people (out of 474 committee members present) in favor, it was passed to change the agenda and discuss it directly in the general assembly. The committee members then took turns speaking, expressing their opinions and raising questions on this case. The questions were mostly concentrated on the nature of the matters that China promised to include in the bilateral agreement stipulated in Section 405 of the US Aid to China Act, and the various issues of using the aid. Foreign Minister Wang answered them separately. After listening to the answers, the committee members responded with applause of trust and satisfaction. The US Aid to China Act was accepted by the highest legislative body of our country with the consent of an overwhelming majority of legislators. The morning meeting ended at 12:30 PM.</p>
<h3>Kuomintang Appoints Seven People to Study Our Foreign Policy</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch, Nanjing, 22nd] In order to study the issue of our country's foreign policy and the attitude of allied countries towards Japan, the Kuomintang broadly discussed it at the Central Political Council on the 21st. Many of the committee members who attended expressed their opinions. Finally, Sun Ke, Wang Chonghui, Weng Wenhao, Chen Bulei, Wu Tiecheng, Wang Shijie, Li Weiguo, and others were appointed to conduct preliminary research for reference. As for the saying that the government will issue a statement on the US's support for Japan, it is still too early to tell.</p>
<h3>Stillman Investigation Team Willing to Assist in Repairing the Hunan-Guizhou Railway</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch, Changsha, 22nd] Stillman went to Hengyang from Xiangtan on the evening of the 21st and to Guangzhou on the 22nd. The team paid close attention to the rich mineral resources along the Hunan-Guizhou Railway and is willing to assist in repairing the Hunan-Guizhou Railway. American railway advisor Han Shiding is especially interested in this project. Han's opinion: The first step of this road should best be able to reach Xupu, or at least Xinhua. The required rails can be taken from all the light rails that are relocated after the Guangdong-Hankou Railway is changed, and the required sleepers can be sourced locally. The restoration of the Hunan-Guizhou Railway, which the people of Hunan have dreamed of for many years, has a chance to become a reality.</p>
<h3>Foreign Minister Wang Explains That the Bilateral Agreement Does Not Involve Our Country's Aviation Rights; Selling Materials Can Achieve the Effect of Reducing Issuance</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch, Nanjing, 22nd] When answering questions about the US Aid to China Act at the meeting of the Legislative Yuan on the 22nd, Foreign Minister Wang emphasized that the bilateral agreement based on accepting US aid would absolutely not affect the integrity of our country's sovereignty. In addition to explaining that the "matters that China has promised" referred to in Section 405 of the Aid to China Act are mainly self-help matters that China has promised to undertake, the Foreign Minister also confirmed that the agreement would definitely not involve the aviation rights that our country should maintain itself. As for the proper interpretation of coastal and inland river navigation rights and the measures that our country takes proactively based on this interpretation, that is another matter. Foreign Minister Wang explained that this US aid is both political and economic. The fact that its plan is only for 12 months is a preliminary step for a fairly long-term plan. Regarding its operating agencies, in addition to passing through the original relevant ministries and commissions, the US Aid Utilization Committee will definitely not be large and will not cause any waste. For the economic aid part, the legal currency received from the sale of materials will all be deposited in the National Bank. Except for the planned use determined by both parties and the one-tenth originally stipulated in the bill to be allocated for rural restoration, it will not be used for other purposes. In this way, it can achieve the effect of reducing issuance and promoting budget balance. As for the validity of the bilateral agreement, it should depend on the needs of using this aid.</p>
<h3>The Legal Currency Reform of the Land Tax; The Case Was Voted Down After Debate in the Legislative Yuan; The Postal Rate Increase Case Was Referred to the Transportation Committee for Review</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch, Nanjing, 22nd] The Legislative Yuan continued its meeting in the afternoon of the 22nd, proceeding with the discussion items listed on the agenda and handling four motions: (1) Yu Ruzhou and others proposed that the government amend Articles 237 and 233 of the Criminal Law. The resolution was to vote it down. (2) Jiang Yiping and others proposed amending Article 30 of the Lawyers Law. The resolution was to refer it to the Legal System Committee for review. (3) Wang Zemin and others proposed that the government should seek the consent of public opinion organizations before increasing the prices of state-owned and publicly-owned professional services. The resolution was to refer it to the Transportation Committee and incorporate it into the Executive Yuan's proposal to increase postal rates for review. (4) Chen Zifeng and others proposed that the land tax be changed to legal currency, and that the collection of treasure and procurement should be abolished. After debate, the resolution was to vote it down. Chen Zifeng's proposal was read out by the reporter, and Chen himself recounted the reasons why the collection in kind was full of abuses and excessively disturbed the people. Deng Chengtao, Deng Shizeng, and Liu Pingsan first raised written objections, stating that the abuses of tax collection lay in the unsoundness of the agency and the lack of integrity of the personnel, and it did not matter whether it was collection in kind or collection in legal currency. Chen's case turned the cart before the horse. The system of land tax collection in kind and procurement was extremely effective in raising military food and civilian food during the Anti-Japanese War. Now that troops are being used for suppression, it should be used as a reference. How can we cut off the source of food and affect basic national policies? In addition, the value of the currency is unstable, and the price of food procurement is difficult to determine fairly. The interests of the government and the people are difficult to take into account fairly. If Chen's case is established, the consequences will be disastrous. Wu Shipeng, Yang Sicheng, and others also spoke against it, while Liu Xieping advocated purchasing public grain with grain price certificates after changing to collecting legal currency. Finally, it was put to a vote. Among the 310 committee members present, only 112 people voted in favor of submitting it for review. This proposal, which was enough to cause the issue of resale, was voted down.</p>

<p>Commentary</p>
<h3>Impressions of a Trip to Japan</h3>
<p>— Wu Gao</p>
<p>Recently, I traveled to Tokyo to conduct an on-the-ground investigation into the general situation of Japan under Allied occupation. I interviewed General MacArthur and the responsible personnel of the Chinese and British delegations, and also had candid discussions with people from all walks of life in Japan. The impressions gained from this trip were quite profound.  In a nutshell, the economic collapse and communization of Japan are the gravest threats to peace in the entire Pacific.</p>
<p>I collected extensive information from various sources regarding Japan's economic and military situation, which made me believe that it would take at least twenty to fifty years for Japan to rebuild its economy and rearm itself enough to pose a real threat to China or the United States. According to MacArthur, he will never allow Japan to be revived and pose a military threat. Anyone who has been to Japan and examined the facts will understand this.  Currently, Japan's "military" consists of only 125,000 Japanese police officers, with an average of one old-fashioned pistol for every five police officers, and half of these are unusable. This is not because the Allied Headquarters lacks weapons, but because MacArthur distrusts the Japanese.  During my meeting with MacArthur, I learned from his tone that the painful experiences he had fighting the Japanese army in the Philippines were unforgettable. As for Japan's "Maritime Safety Agency," there has been much discussion in Chinese public opinion, saying that it could be the foundation for Japan's future navy; in reality, this is not entirely true. The so-called "Maritime Safety Agency" only has 38 small boats of seventy to eighty tons each, and none of them are armed. These small boats are only used for rescue and anti-smuggling purposes.</p>
<p>However, on the other hand, the power of the Japanese Communist Party is like the rising sun, constantly expanding. The reason for this is the economic situation in Japan.  Currently, the food shortage problem in Japan cannot be solved, and the general situation in the economic world is extremely chaotic, resulting in a decline in the general economic level, which only helps the development of the Japanese Communist Party.  If this situation is allowed to continue unchecked, I am afraid there will be alarming progress. According to the Japanese Communist Party, it has 50,000 to 60,000 party members, but according to foreign estimates, its external guard alone has at least one million people, especially in northern Japan, which is close to the Soviet Union. They are the famous "rice bowl" communists.  In the event that the Soviet Union decides to "island hop" and invade northern Japan, their "rice bowls" can still be guaranteed. However, most Japanese people are taciturn and know everything very well in their hearts. The people of China and the United States have suffered greatly in the war against Japan and will never forget the atrocities of the Japanese soldiers, so I believe that Japan will never have a chance to turn over under the control of the Allied Headquarters. However, in the eyes of the Japanese, there is also a hope at present, which is communism. They believe that the Soviet Union did not really fight Japan, so the Soviet people do not have the unforgettable unpleasant memories of the people of China and the United States in the minds of the Japanese.  What's more, the Soviet Union welcomes red Japan to join their camp! Although the Japanese Communist Party does not have an international background on the surface, the Japanese Communist Party and the Korean Communist Party are in contact, and the Korean Communist Party and the Chinese Communist Party in Northeast China are in contact. If Japan, North Korea, and Northeast China form a communist group, then the Soviet Union can also have an "Iron Curtain" in the Far East and do whatever it wants.  The Soviet Union will never miss this opportunity. Therefore, at present, if we Chinese do not broaden our horizons and see the truth of the world situation, and blindly oppose the anti-Japan policy currently being implemented by the United States, it is tantamount to approving the forced communization of Japan!</p>
<p>The Allied Headquarters does not take the danger of Japan's communization lightly. In fact, the economic policy of the Allied Headquarters is to prevent Japan from going bankrupt economically and not allowing the Communist Party to take advantage of the situation.  For example, land reform, increasing food imports, gradually restoring foreign trade, and increasing living standards are all being implemented in order. The Allied Headquarters believes that this is the only way to resist the communist threat to Japan.  However, the Communist International is able to deeply understand the purpose of the economic policy of the Allied Headquarters, so it is doing everything possible to engage in a large-scale propaganda movement in China, trying to create the illusion for the Chinese people, turning the anti-American and pro-Japanese movement of professional students and cultural peddlers into a genuine anti-American movement of the general public, so that there is a gap between the two major Allied countries of China and the United States, and then they can safely let go and communize Asia and the world.  But according to my observation, Japanese workers will never threaten the markets of China, the United States, and Britain in the next two or thirty years. My reasons are twofold: (1) Japan has already lost its pre-war supply of raw materials, so it cannot obtain cheap raw materials; (2) because the Allied Headquarters encourages labor unions and collective contracts, the low wages in Japan no longer exist, and even its wage level is far above that of China. For example, a set of silk kimono costs US$14 in Tokyo, but only US$5 in Shanghai. It is impossible for Japanese goods to be sold cheaply, so how can they compete with goods from other countries? General Shang Zhen of our delegation also agrees with me that Japan's economic recovery is not enough to pose a threat to China and the United States.</p>
<p>My impression of MacArthur is also very deep. I think he should be one of the top figures in the United States and can run for president of the United States. If he can often return to the country and have more contact with voters, he will definitely be elected. However, MacArthur always refuses the invitation of Congress on the grounds that his "duties are binding" and concentrates on managing defeated Japan so that it does not become a communist vassal.  MacArthur has many brilliant insights into the political situation in China and is not superficially knowledgeable. During my meeting with MacArthur, I touched on many domestic issues in China. MacArthur's position on China's problems has not changed since his letter to Representative Judd, Chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, on March 3 this year, advocating increased aid to China. Some people deliberately say that he underestimates China's important position in the Far East. As long as you have a detailed conversation with MacArthur, you will know that this is all nonsense.  Someone said that he has a unique view on China's problems. He believes that if the Chinese government cannot concentrate all its efforts on solving military problems, then other problems are out of the question. At the same time, he also believes that if the Chinese government cannot obtain the "full" assistance of the United States, then it will not be easy for the Chinese government to solve its military problems.  If the current Chinese government troops stick to the old ways and adopt a strategy of positional warfare, it will be difficult to eliminate the military pressure of the Chinese Communists. In the future, only by adopting a new type of mobile strategy can the Communist army be defeated. MacArthur has the most extensive understanding of the Pacific. After talking with him, one believes that MacArthur is not only the MacArthur of the Philippines, not only the MacArthur of Japan, but also the MacArthur of the Pacific against totalitarianism. He said that in the entire Pacific situation, China is the first bulwark against totalitarianism. He also knows deeply the psychology of the Chinese people's fear of the Japanese, and at the same time, he also has painful memories of the Japanese, which he will never forget. He will never allow Japanese militarism to be revived. In practical terms, he believes that even if World War III breaks out, the United States does not need Japan as its ally.</p>
<p>In short, today's Japan is completely under the control of the Allied Headquarters. The economic recovery of Japan is still out of the question; the re-emergence of militarism will only be possible in at least thirty or forty years. However, China, Britain, and the United States must be united and consistent, otherwise, if they are provoked and their steps deviate, it will lead to unfortunate consequences. Totalitarian propagandists have armed themselves with the issue of Japan in an attempt to divide the relationship between China and the United States. This is something we must be careful to prevent in order to avoid falling into this insidious trap!</p>

<h3>Red Actress Zhou Wenna Eloped with Lover – Elderly Father Killed in Attempt to Find Daughter – Strange Murder Case Occurs in Shenyang – Complicated Plot Revolves Around Wealth, Lust, and Both</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper Shenyang 17th Dispatch] At around 4:00 a.m. this morning, a murder case occurred in the New World Theater in Panyang. The deceased was Zhou Xuwu (54 years old), the father of the local red actress Zhou Wenna, who died from two gunshots to the head. His mother, Zhou Wang (46 years old), suffered two gunshots to the leg and was seriously injured. At dawn on the 17th, three strange men suddenly broke into the Zhou residence, wearing black uniforms and top hats. They woke up Zhou Xuwu and his wife, initially claiming to be checking household registrations, but then demanded gold bars. Zhou Xuwu said: We are artists, living off our daughter, how could we have gold bars? Zhou's mother was willing to offer two gold rings, but the bandits refused, and immediately dragged Zhou's father to the corridor and shot him dead before fleeing. The case involves family, love and other issues, and is complicated. The inside story is recorded as follows: Zhou Xuwu from Penglai, Shandong, lived in Dalian and had a daughter, Zhou Wenna (19 years old). She learned acting from a young age, and as she grew up, she became beautiful and versatile, with a round and clear voice, and many fans were fascinated. She had a good reputation in Dalian. Last spring, she fled to Tianjin, but there were few admirers. Later, the whole family came to Shenyang and sang in the New World Theater, becoming extremely popular for a while. Last summer, she met Chen Shixi, a quartermaster colonel in the military, who was generous and wealthy. Over time, they fell in love and eloped. The father had a penchant for opium and regarded his daughter as a cash cow, so he often tried to dissuade her. Zhou was depressed and dejected. Just when Chen was caught embezzling, he escaped to Beiping with her on the 4th of this month. After the disappearance of the red actress, her parents learned the truth from her second daughter, Hongna. They regretted their decision and realized that they would have no source of income in the future. They decided to pack their bags and fly to Beiping on the 18th to find their daughter, but unexpectedly, they were killed on the 17th. The reporter visited Zhou's wife, Wang, and saw that she had four gemstone gold rings on her hands, which were sparkling, indicating that she was quite wealthy. She looked dazed and spoke weakly. She said that someone had recently told her that Wenna and Chen had reappeared on the street, but she had not seen them return home. She believed that her daughter was still in Beiping and suspected that the case was related to Chen. Although this murder case is very tortuous, the plot revolves around wealth and lust. The police have now obtained clues and it will not be difficult to solve the case in the next few days.</p>
<h3>Yang Mei Arrives at He Residence by Special Car – Begins Intense Examination Life</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper Chongqing 22nd Dispatch] Yang Mei arrived in the city at 5:30 PM this afternoon, taking a special ambulance from Jiulongpo, accompanied by He Zongwen, She Shengyang and Mrs. She, Mrs. Che, and nurses and police. She was transferred by the Health Bureau to He Guoguang's mansion next to the Zhongzheng Hospital, and began an intense examination life that the world cares about. Yang Mei was wearing a floral patterned cheongsam and white shoes and socks. Upon arriving at the He residence, she did not feel tired climbing dozens of steps, and she even publicly stated the name of Dean Hu, whom she had parted with for 21 days. Yang Mei lives on the first floor of the He residence, with a total of two rooms, which have Yongmenting wooden floors, and another hygiene room. Starting at 12:00, the Zhongzheng Hospital sent people to decorate Yang Mei's room. After Yang Mei arrived, the original residents moved out and rearranged the room. Yang Mei lives with a nurse, who takes care of her in shifts day and night. There is a large lawn in front of the room, which Yang Mei is most satisfied with. Standing on the stone steps, one can overlook the city view. There is a side door that leads to Zhongtao. The key is kept by Nurse Chief Chuan Xizhen, and no outsiders are allowed to open the door without her permission. Also, Attorney Wang Xianjia went to meet Hu Xianwen at 2:30 PM and had a long conversation. The result was satisfactory. Hu emphasized that scientists love specimens more than themselves and will never kill the goose to get the eggs. Moreover, scientific procedures do not allow loopholes, so he attaches importance to Yang Mei's daily life, and everything will never be forced, because abnormal normal life can create unnatural and artificial results.

<h3>Inside Story of Corruption Case in Changzhou Field Grain Office – Weng Cheng Not Clean – Lu Pinjin Flees</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper News] During the tenure of former County Magistrate Weng, Lu Pinjin, the clerk and chief of the Third Section of the County Field Grain Office, who was personally appointed by Weng, committed corruption. After the report, the Provincial Office investigated and confirmed the truth. Chairman Wang telegraphed to order the county to detain him and hand him over to the court for strict handling. The Academy complied with Weng's request and released him on bail under the pretext of handling the handover. Unexpectedly, after being released on bail, he fled without a trace, just like Shou Xuefan (one of the key figures in the corruption), who was released by Weng's relative, Zhou. Recently, the Field Grain Office discovered that Tianfeng Rice Mill, a special rice mill, used more than 3,500 of the owed grain. The inside story is dark and is also related to Lu Pinjin. The summons was nowhere to be found, and public opinion translated. The court is now ordering the guarantor to hand over the person within three days. According to reports, Weng Cheng has served as county magistrate in Yongjia and Qingtian counties in Zhejiang Province. During his tenure, he was also known for corruption. The Zhejiang Provincial Council's investigation into the flying bomb case has not yet ended, and he has only been in office in this county for nine months, and he has not made any achievements in county administration and there are many drawbacks. Recently, it was discovered that Weng Cheng spent 60,000 to 70,000 shi of surplus grain beyond the top budget. Before leaving, he also asked the remaining rice mills for 300 million yuan, which made onlookers feel disgusted.</p>
<h3>Subei Front Lines: A Night at Hede Town</h3>
<p>— Special Correspondent Ling Songshou</p>
<p>[Funing Report, This Newspaper, 19th] Due to transportation issues, this reporter missed the opportunity to witness the National Army's capture of Hede Town. However, upon arriving in Funing, I immediately mounted a horse and galloped with all my might towards the long-awaited Hede Town.</p>
<p>Hede Town is the so-called Yan'an of northern Jiangsu, at least in the eyes of the people of northern Jiangsu, a</p>
<p>mysterious place. From before the war until now, almost a dozen years have passed. Except for the two years when the enemy occupied it, it has always been under the control of the Communist bandits and served as their "command post" in the northern Jiangsu war zone.</p>
<p>Leaving Funing, small streams and rivers were everywhere. These rivers became natural obstacles in the coastal area. During this National Army campaign, a lot of time was spent on bridge building, which gave the bandits a chance to escape, preventing the achievement of ideal results. The area thirty miles outside Funing City was originally a very good reclamation area before the war, but after ten years of control by the Communist bandits, thousands of acres of fertile land have been turned back into wasteland, overgrown with weeds, stretching as far as the eye can see, causing unspeakable sorrow.</p>
<p>Hede Town is not large, and arriving at Hede shattered my previous expectations of it. On the south bank of the Sheyang River, there are one or two hundred households. The cross-shaped streets are sparsely lined with simple thatched huts... This is Hede. A small river quietly flows from its northwest corner to its east corner, dividing it into two parts.</p>
<p>Hede Town used to be a large town in the coastal area and had a Hede Salt Reclamation Company here. I saw the layout of the Hede Company in a video taken from the air, which was a very large and well-organized building. It is located in the southeast corner of Hede Town, about three Chinese miles from the town center. When I went to see it, the interior was in a chaotic mess. It is said that Chen Yi, Su Yu, Guan Wenwei, Chen Qingxian... all lived in these very ordinary tile houses for a long time. Apart from the Hede Company, there are not many tile houses in Hede Town. There is a Huazhong Bank in the southern section of North-South Street, a cooperative in the eastern section of East-West Street, and the Sheyang Public Hospital in the northeast corner of the town. These are the only tile houses in Hede Town, and they were built by the enemy.</p>
<p>Hede Town has been occupied by the Communist bandits for more than ten years, but not only did they not build anything here, but they also destroyed the machinery of the original small flour mills and yarn factories. All that remains is a repair shop and a clothing factory. Speaking of farmland, from military maps or aerial photographs, the area within dozens of miles around Hede Town is crisscrossed with fields, a neatly arranged reclamation area. However, at present, apart from a very small number of fields near Hede Town that are planted with crops, more than 90% of the fields are bare, facing the sky. From looking at the four suburbs, thinking of Yan'an in the distance, and looking at Hede up close, I was foolishly thinking about the situation if the Communist bandits seized power.</p>
<p>Unless you truly join the Communist bandits or act as a henchman for them, it is not easy to be an honest and obedient citizen in the bandit area. The land has been divided, but it is not given to you for free. Public grain and public grass must be borrowed in advance, local officials will extort you, and there will be ×× donations... It is probably impossible for one person to eat their fill from three acres of land. If you want to do business, they have strict control. You must register your goods in and out, and you must obtain a guarantee to leave the bandit area—guaranteeing that you will return. When the goods are brought back, you must sell them all to their commercial bank, and they will give you a meager profit. Of course, the things you bring back must be what they need. In fact, the most important goods are directly purchased by their cadres in Jiangnan and smuggled back by sea. The waterway from the Sheyang River estuary to Hede Town is only forty Chinese miles. This is the main reason for the importance of Hede Town.</p>
<p>When the National Army first entered Hede Town, there were only more than seven hundred women, children, and elderly people. Three days later, the population had doubled with the return of people from the surrounding villages. The people of Hede Town also see the Central Government and the National Army as a mystery. "Ten years, and we've only just seen the National Army." This was what an elder of seventy years old told me.</p>

<h3>US Republican Party's New Policy Platform Submitted to National Convention for Vote; Advocates Strengthening Traditional Friendship with China</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] New York, 22nd (Broadcast): Philadelphia report, the Republican National Convention's presidential candidate nomination began at 9 PM on Wednesday. Dewey took the lead, Taft closely followed, and Stassen lagged behind. However, Stassen stated that he would persist to the end and was unwilling to accept the nomination as the vice-presidential candidate.</p>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] New York, 22nd (Broadcast): Philadelphia report, the Republican National Convention began its second session at 12:22 AM today, announcing the party's policy platform. The meeting time was 22 minutes later than originally scheduled.</p>
<p>[United Press, Philadelphia, 22nd] Republican policy drafters today disclosed the policy platform, advocating an internationalist foreign policy, and on the domestic front, advocating continued tax cuts, protection of human rights, and a decisive battle against communism. The policy platform, passed by a 104-member motion committee, will be submitted to the full convention on the 22nd for a formal vote. The policy platform, totaling 2,700 words, elaborates on the principles of the Republican Party, which hopes to use this to achieve its first presidential election victory in twenty years. The policy platform guarantees government economy, anti-inflation, a strong military, a long-term agricultural program, continuation of the Taft-Hartley Labor Act, with improvements when necessary, a comprehensive land reclamation plan, and expansion of the security system. At the same time, it severely criticizes the Truman administration for its improper handling of domestic and foreign affairs. The foreign affairs section advocates continued assistance to "peace-loving countries," limiting the abuse of veto power within the United Nations, organizing UN forces, and a policy of "welcoming cooperation against appeasement with goodwill and determination." The articles on foreign aid are as follows: "Within the limits of our economic well-being, we will cooperate on the basis of self-help and mutual assistance to aid other peace-loving countries to restore their economic independence, human rights, and basic freedoms. We will firmly demand that all foreign aid matters be implemented in a pragmatic and effective manner." The policy platform also guarantees support for the reciprocal trade system, but "always protects our country's agriculture and industry," and guarantees full recognition of the new Jewish state of Israel in accordance with the letter and spirit of the United Nations Charter. It also stated: "We will advocate the historic friendship with China and express deep concern for its efforts to maintain sovereignty and freedom." The motion committee passed the Republican policy platform proposal, including one or two important additional clauses, one advocating recognition of Israel, and the other a strong anti-communist declaration without directly mentioning the Soviet Union. The introductory remarks at the beginning of the policy platform summarized the international goals, stating: "Our foreign policy aims to protect the free United States in a free world of free people. This requires the strengthening of the United Nations and the basic recognition of the United States' right to be interested in the freedom of other people."</p>
<p>[Reuters, Philadelphia, 22nd] As the Republican National Convention began debating foreign policy leaders on the 22nd, an unexpected debate will occur. Delegates arriving later are extremely resentful of the full internationalism in the draft foreign policy platform. Indiana Senator Harness, after arriving late yesterday, told reporters that he would work with other delegates to "remove some international teeth from the foreign policy platform." Harness is a member of the Resolutions Committee of the full convention.</p>
<h3>Illinois Governor Green Promotes Republican Policies; Vigorously Criticizes the Democratic New Deal</h3>
<p>[United Press, Philadelphia, 21st] Illinois Governor Green delivered a policy speech at the Republican National Convention here on the evening of the 21st, saying that the Republican Party would launch a movement to become a "peace-seeking" party in terms of foreign policy. In terms of domestic policy, it will oppose the New Deal's "establishment" and "bureaucracy" and adopt a "free enterprise" policy. Green called on the delegates to elect "new leaders for a greater America" and made a confident prediction that the Republican Party would win the presidential election and continue to control Congress in the general election in November.</p>
<p>Green also stated that the New Deal cannot win with Truman. Even if Truman is not nominated to run for president, no matter who the Democratic National Convention nominates as the presidential candidate, they will follow the old policy of the New Deal, which the American people no longer believe in. Green also warned the most conservative members of the Republican Party: "We will no longer return to any old ways of the past. Everything in the past tells us that we have a task for the future." Green repeatedly criticized the government's "inefficiency" and "unproductive waste" over the past sixteen years, and strongly criticized the Democratic Party's foreign policy actions. He denounced the fact that the US government repeatedly promised peace even when it knew that war was inevitable. "The only promise the government kept was the promise the government made to Stalin. Because of this promise, the victory of World War II has been rendered nominal by appeasing the Soviet Union. The world war we are facing today is the product of the combination of the New Deal and communism. The New Deal cannot escape this crime by using bipartisan foreign policy as an excuse, because the Republican Party did not participate in the Tehran, Yalta, or Potsdam conferences." Green guaranteed that the Republican Party would adopt a "very firm" policy to ensure peace and restore the world's trust and respect for American diplomacy. He also stated that the core of the Republican foreign policy lies in using wisdom and determination and expanding American democracy to contain the spread of world slavery. "We are not inciting stock disputes. On the contrary, we will pursue every peaceful method. We will make this conference a true alliance for peace."</p>
<h3>Mrs. Roosevelt's Tone Consistent with Green's</h3>
<p>[United Press, Philadelphia, 21st] Mrs. Roosevelt, former US Congresswoman and wife of the publisher of Time and Life magazines, stated in a speech at the Republican National Convention on the evening of the 21st that millions of people have been plunged into death and slavery due to the secret transactions of Roosevelt and Truman with the Soviet Union. These people are the Poles whom we want to give freedom to and the brave people in Eastern and Central Europe who worked underground for us, all of whom have been convicted for the sins of Yalta and Potsdam.</p>

<h3>US Republican National Convention Venue Decorated with Splendor; Convention Activities Broadcast via Television</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Philadelphia, 22nd] In terms of material arrangements and public facilities, the 1948 Republican National Convention will be the largest gathering of its kind. The tall and majestic convention venue is located next to the University of Pennsylvania. When it was built, it cost more than $5 million. In order to cope with this year's national conventions of various political parties, Philadelphia has spent more than $500,000 to specially repair it. The venue can accommodate more than 13,000 people, who can personally listen to the proceedings of this historic gathering. But this year, it is estimated that more than 20 million people can witness the various activities of the convention through television transceivers.</p>
<p>This is the first time in history that the venue has been equipped with 50,000 kilowatts of lighting for photography and transmission. The heat released by the lighting is equivalent to that under the scorching sun, so those who give speeches at the convention will be sweating profusely. To resist this sultry heat, the venue has been equipped with cold water equipment, and there are two cranes specially used to lift tons of ice. Many new radio booths with glass barriers have also been set up in the venue for broadcasting to major national telecommunications networks. Special microphones are installed everywhere in the broadcast positions, so that even the lowest sound in any corner of this vast venue can be amplified. The thoroughness of the telecommunications equipment can be seen in the following example. A radio station in Los Angeles has rented a private telephone line that is 3,000 miles long, renting it for 18 hours a day, so that as soon as the broadcast of the dramatic developments of the convention is released, the radio station can listen to it and rebroadcast it. The preparation of news reporters should also be mentioned here. The news reporters' seats are located on both sides of the convention rostrum, which is hung with portraits of famous Republican presidents of the past, with a total of more than 800 seats. The basement of the convention venue is full of work areas, where news agencies from all over the world have set up offices. The Central News Agency has an office unit here. In addition, hundreds of special telephones have been installed in the venue. A telecommunications company has specially installed equipment here that can send 5,000 words per minute. It is estimated that the news reporters will send a total of 300,000 words of telegrams for this convention. All of this grand occasion is worthy of being called "unprecedented."</p>
<h3>Soviet, American, British, and French Experts Meet to Discuss Berlin Currency Reform Issues; Will Also Discuss Trade Relations in the Four Occupation Zones</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Berlin, 22nd] The negotiations on currency reform in Berlin's four-power zone are scheduled to be held at 1:00 PM on the 22nd in the Berlin Allied Control Council. Soviet Commander-in-Chief Sokolovsky accepted the final proposal of the British, American, and French demands to hold this meeting on the night of the 21st, agreeing that four-power experts would discuss the issue of currency reform in Berlin.</p>
<p>The Soviet financial experts attending the meeting include Soviet Military Government Chief Financial Advisor Maritin, and Berlin Soviet Commander Colonel Mishin, etc. The French representatives are Leroy, Penier, Humbert, etc. The American representatives are Bennett and Wilkinson, and the heads of the British, American, and French military governments. In addition to the issue of currency reform, it is also proposed to discuss trade relations between the Soviet zone and the Western occupation zones.</p>
<h3>East Germany Changes Currency System; Plan Awaiting Implementation</h3>
<p>According to Rau, Chairman of the East German Economic Commission, Sokolovsky will approve the currency reform plan at any time. After implementation, the greatest protection will be given to workers, small-capital merchants, and intellectuals, while the greatest blows will be given to black market merchants and those suspected of war crimes. Wages and pensions will still be paid in the same amount in the new currency. Small savings that were frozen after the Soviet army occupied Germany in 1945 will be unfrozen. In addition, state-owned enterprises, democratic parties, trade unions, and municipal authorities can obtain preferential treatment for their funds.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Berlin, 21st] The latest report here confirms that the first step of the East German currency reform will be to stamp the old mark notes to distinguish them from the old marks that have lost their value in West Germany. At the same time, Berlin banks announced that they will no longer accept deposits from today. For days, long queues have formed outside the banks, waiting to open new accounts in the banks. They believe that after the currency reform is implemented, savings depositors can expect to receive more preferential treatment.</p>
<h3>US Military Train Refuses Soviet Inspection; Air Transport Resumes</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Berlin, 21st] US Commander-in-Chief Clay declared that the number of US freight trains traveling from the west to Berlin will be temporarily suspended due to the Soviet insistence on implementing strict inspections, and air transport will be resumed. Clay stressed that the Soviet inspection of US military trains is a violation of the 1945 four-power agreement, and the US will never agree.</p>
<p>[United Nations, Berlin, 21st] The 10,000 US troops and civilians here all rely on air transport for supplies. The average number of planes flying back and forth every day is now 20, which will increase to about 70 from tomorrow. The British army has increased six planes.</p>

<h3>Large Number of Communists Infiltrate and Engage in Activities; Situation in Southern Thailand Suddenly Tightens; Malaya Continues to Search for Terrorists</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Bangkok, 22nd] Officials announced: A large number of Malayan communists have infiltrated southern Thailand. The authorities have dispatched police reinforcements to the southern border area to strengthen defenses. Authoritative sources told this agency that the situation in southern Thailand has suddenly tightened due to the infiltration of Malayan communist elements. However, the Thai government still believes that it will not be difficult to suppress the illegal elements. After many top communist leaders were recently captured in Bangkok and the capitals of various provinces, the communist conspiracy to riot has been dealt a blow and will not play out like the recent situation in Malaya. The recent tightening of the situation in the south is probably due to the government's revocation of the state of emergency recently declared there.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Singapore, 21st] Police began searching for communist terrorists throughout Malaya this morning. It is reported that 113 people were arrested in Selangor, 30 were captured in Negeri Sembilan, 60 were captured in Perak (including 10 women), and more than 50 were arrested in Johor. However, many communist suspects and terrorists escaped justice. This morning, the police simultaneously searched the various branches of the Communist Party, the New Democratic Youth League, and a number of union meeting places throughout Malaya. However, most of the above locations were already empty, and all documents had been removed.</p>
<h3>US Consuls in Southeast Asia Meet in Bangkok</h3>

Four officials from the State Department were also sent to participate in the meeting. It is said that this meeting is purely to discuss general affairs of US consulates in the Southeast Asia region. It was also revealed by US Embassy officials here that Stanton will return to Washington on the 30th and will only return after about three months.</p>
<h3>Mountbatten to be Appointed as British Ambassador to the Soviet Union</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 22nd] After returning to London from New Delhi yesterday, outgoing Indian Governor-General Mountbatten immediately answered Prime Minister Attlee's summons and went to 10 Downing Street for a meeting. Related sources said that Mountbatten will soon be appointed to another important position, possibly as the Ambassador to Moscow.</p>
<h3>Dispatching Japanese People Abroad to Participate in International Conferences</h3>
<p>Far Eastern Commission Approves US Proposal</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 21st (United Press)] The Far Eastern Commission announced that it has approved the US proposal to allow the Allied General Headquarters stationed in Japan to send Japanese people abroad to participate in international conferences. The Far Eastern Commission's action is actually only ratifying the steps that MacArthur has already taken based on his temporary authority. The Commission authorized MacArthur to send Allied General Headquarters observers to international conferences when he deems it necessary (if acceptable to the host country of the conference). Japanese technical experts may also accompany them.</p>
<h3>Dewey and Taft's Strength Will Soon be Revealed</h3>
<p>Vandenberg's Hopes of Winning Decrease</p>
<p>[Reuters, Philadelphia, 21st] The candidates for the Republican presidential nomination have begun to prepare to fight for an advantage. Observers believe that Vandenberg's hopes of winning have decreased in the past 24 hours. This is probably because Vandenberg has not yet clearly stated whether he is willing to be nominated as a presidential candidate. His arrival here from Washington only on the 21st, and the sudden launch of a blitz offensive by Dewey's supporters. Dewey's supporters held talks with delegates to the full convention yesterday and held a press conference, launching moving propaganda in hotels. The first test of strength in the convention venue will be seen in the vote of the Credentials Committee of the full convention on Tuesday, because the delegation from Georgia has staged a double-package case, both claiming to represent the Republican Party of the state. One supports the nomination of Dewey, and the other supports the nomination of Taft. The vote of the Credentials Committee determines which is the legitimate delegation, which is tantamount to testing the strength of Dewey and Taft. It is said that Stassen's supporters also intend to support the Taft faction in the vote of the Credentials Committee in order to obstruct the Dewey faction, which is too prominent. The second strength test will be seen in the debate on foreign policy on Tuesday or Wednesday. The isolationists led by House Speaker Martin will do their best to revise the Republican foreign policy platform passed by the subcommittee.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Philadelphia, 21st] After the Republican National Convention opened, there were various forms of activities outside the convention. Dewey, Stassen, and Taft all set up campaign headquarters in Philadelphia hotels. The three of them were busy contacting and running around, and they were very nervous. MacArthur's campaign headquarters is located in a hotel. The building is smaller and the momentum is weaker. The competition will be initially determined in the next three days.</p>

<h3>Sixth Session, Second Day: Senators Questioned, Blaming City Government's Rice Distribution Price for Leading Commodity Price Increases</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] The Municipal Senate's first sixth session held its second meeting yesterday afternoon, starting at 3:00 PM. A total of 168 people attended, including the Speaker, Deputy Speaker, and Senators. Mayor Wu and heads of various bureaus and departments of the Municipal Government were also present. Over the course of four hours, Senators questioned and received responses from the Mayor, as well as the Directors of the Finance, Education, Public Utilities, and Public Works Bureaus. The atmosphere was generally calm and rational. The meeting adjourned at 7:10 PM.</p>
<p>The third meeting will be held this afternoon, with the agenda focusing on questions and answers directed at the Police, Social Affairs, Land Administration, Civil Affairs, and Health Bureaus. As of yesterday, 105 proposals had been submitted by Senators to the assembly. The deadline for collecting proposals for the session has been extended to this afternoon.</p>
<p>The questioning regarding the Mayor's policy report began yesterday afternoon. The Senators who raised questions included Mei Hao, Zhang Zhongyuan, Pang Jingzhou, Tong Xiang, Wang Weiyin, Jiang Haoran, Yu Chuanding, Zhao Yangxiong, Qu Yue, Fan Xipin, He Chengfu, and Tao Guangchuan. The key questions are summarized as follows:</p>
<p>(1) It has been found that many government agencies in the city frequently refuse to pay various public utility fees, such as electricity bills. Non-payment by government agencies accounts for 5-10% of the electricity company's total revenue. Furthermore, military personnel riding without tickets account for 30-40% of the total number of passengers. How will this be addressed? How can public utilities be allowed to raise prices three times in a row since February? How can ordinary citizens afford it? (2) The city government's rice distribution price is leading to increases in black market rice prices and overall commodity prices. It would be better for the city government to distribute rice rather than sell it directly, so that citizens can directly benefit. Furthermore, the limits on rice purchases are not being enforced, so they should be abolished. (3) What is the progress of the special relief donation drive? The six-month deadline is approaching, and apportioning donations to various trade associations is not an effective method. The focus should still be on soliciting donations from wealthy families. (4) Can the Mayor seek US aid from the central government, and can the Mayor announce a plan for utilizing US aid? Can the Senate appoint representatives to inquire about US aid matters? (5) For all future municipal affairs, whether political or economic, preventive measures should be taken beforehand, so that the darkness before dawn can be easily overcome. (6) Why did the Municipal Bank and the Industrial Trust Company not show any profits in the 36th year's financial statements? (7) The education budget accounts for 20% of total expenditures, but the actual expenditure was 14%. If it is claimed that education is constrained by funding, why is the full amount not being used? (8) There are rumors that the Municipal Government Personnel Office will be under the jurisdiction of the central government. If the Municipal Government believes that the organization is unsuitable, it should work with other municipal governments to advocate for what is right with the central government. (9) When dealing with student unrest, can guidance be prioritized as the first step? (10) Are there any new policies to stabilize society and control commodity prices in the future? (11) How will outstanding civil servants be cultivated and rewarded?</p>
<h3>Mayor Responds to Questions: Rice Prices Have Not Led Commodity Prices; Special Donation Drive Faces Significant Difficulties</h3>
<p>After the questioning, the Mayor took the stage to respond, stating: The Municipal Government is constantly working to resolve the issue of government agencies and personnel refusing to pay utility fees. The Municipal Government agencies' arrears for electricity bills are not large and will be paid off soon. The Municipal Government has telegraphed the relevant agencies under the Central Government in Shanghai to discuss solutions. The Ministry of National Defense has sent personnel to Shanghai to facilitate payment. As for military personnel riding without tickets, it has been decided to reinstate the military and police inspectorate to investigate and crack down on this issue at various stations. According to general commodity price statistics, the rise in rice prices is less than that of other commodities, proving that rice prices have not led commodity prices. The reason why rice prices remain high despite both direct sales and distribution is that Shanghai is not a production area. When production areas increase prices, Shanghai cannot maintain lower prices on its own. The principle of rice distribution requires a sufficient supply of rice. Direct sales are used to regulate the market, and people are often sent to investigate whether sales are in accordance with price limits after the rice is sold. Therefore, price limits must still exist. Regarding the gasoline issue, the Municipal Government will hold a meeting with the Central Bank and other parties tomorrow (the 23rd) to discuss solutions. The special relief donation drive faces numerous difficulties. (1) It is difficult to investigate individuals. (2) It is also difficult to investigate the assets of wealthy families. However, if free donations cannot be implemented, the Municipal Government will devise other appropriate methods. The central government decides how to use US aid, and we can only request instructions from the central government. The reason for underutilization of education funds is the need to "rob Peter to pay Paul." For example, the road maintenance fees for the Public Works Bureau and the garbage truck repair fees for the Health Bureau have exceeded their budgets and must be immediately supplemented. Otherwise, broken roads and garbage everywhere will immediately affect citizens. "Stabilizing society and controlling commodity prices" was never a slogan of mine. Although it has not been achieved yet, I have always wanted to achieve it. However, commodity prices are related to currency, and the currency rate is a national issue. Therefore, local governments can only assist the central government in controlling commodity prices. Today's student unrest, using anti-Americanism and support for Japan as slogans, is no longer a question of patriotism, but a question of whether the attitude is open and aboveboard. I am confident that my attitude towards the Jiaotong University incident has always been impartial. Therefore, I have decided to bring this matter to the Senate and the five million citizens of Shanghai so that they can distinguish right from wrong, and avoid a situation in which everyone uses good pretexts to pursue their own selfish goals.</p>
<h3>Bribed Tax Officials: Rewards for Reporting</h3>
<p>After the Mayor finished his response, it was almost 5:00 PM. After a ten-minute break, the questioning and responses from each bureau began. First up was the Finance Bureau. Only Tao Guangchuan raised two points: how to reward those who report tax officials taking bribes, and how to prevent bribery. Director Tian responded: I have very strict requirements for my subordinates and often urge them to respect their integrity. If any wrongdoing is discovered, it will be sent to the court for investigation. Rewarding junior staff to prevent bribery is still a fundamental solution. Whenever there is a vacancy at any level in this bureau, it will be filled by promoting existing staff, and no new people will be added, as an incentive.</p>
<h3>School Principal's Corruption: Education Bureau is Thoroughly Investigating</h3>
<p>The senators questioning the Education Bureau included Zhang Zhongyuan, Fan Xipin, and Qu Yue. Director Li responded to each question as follows: (1) Regarding the construction of the art museum, the donation of 15 mu of land from Hardoon Garden has been decided, and construction can begin as soon as the charitable fund is allocated. (2) Principals are required to have guarantees from officials because recently one or two municipal principals left their positions for various reasons and disappeared. Therefore, the old practice is being revisited. The suggestion of mutual guarantees by principals is worth considering. (3) The construction materials for the Xinlu Normal School at the Yangjing site are ready, and construction can begin as soon as the Municipal Government allocates the construction funds. (4) Whether Dong Chengjian, the principal of the Municipal Normal School, is corrupt is being thoroughly investigated by the Municipal Education Bureau. (5) The establishment of a national school in the Laozha district is being negotiated, and it will definitely be established after the summer vacation.</p>
<h3>Roads Cannot be Fully Repaired Due to Limited Funding</h3>
<p>Those who questioned the Public Works Bureau included Yu Ting and Shi Jiadong. Director Zhao replied, stating: (1) Roads in the North Station area cannot be fully repaired due to limited funding. However, construction on Zhejiang North Road has recently begun, and repairs will be carried out on Shanxi North Road, Tanggu Road, and Henan North Road. Construction of Station South Road is pending approval from the Executive Yuan because the road alignment belongs to the Railway Bureau. (2) Factory construction licenses in the city are still based on the factory exclusion zone regulations established by the Municipal Government in the 23rd year of the Republic. (3) If there are difficulties or delays in applying for construction licenses, please report them as much as possible. (4) Construction of the Zhaohe Memorial Tower has been delayed due to funding issues.</p>
<h3>Proposal to Request the Control Yuan to Thoroughly Investigate and Announce the Truth About the Central Bank's Use of Foreign Exchange</h3>
<p>The Municipal Senate has continued to receive proposals in the past few days, including: (1) A proposal submitted by Fu Rulin, Yu Shun, Wang Yansong, Chen Gongda, Zhang Zhihan, Ji Yuanpu, and 40 others, requesting the Control Yuan to thoroughly investigate and announce the truth about the Central Bank's use of foreign exchange and the status of import and export management in the past two years, so as to learn from it and seek improvement. (2) A proposal by Wang Liben and Chen Ruhui, asking whether the conference can present a serious protest to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in the name of the conference against the Siamese government's deliberate destruction of overseas Chinese education and illegal suppression of overseas Chinese schools, requesting a decision. (3) Yan Fa Sheng proposed that the association send a telegram to the Political Council ordering the China Trust Bureau to stop tendering Japanese wool fabrics. (4) Chen Peide and others proposed that the transfer of land property rights in this city should be reformed so that personnel in charge of field affairs are the legal advisers. (5) Zhang Zhusan and others proposed that the Municipal Government should lead both labor and management to jointly build new labor villages. (6) Fan Cai Kui and others proposed that the Municipal Government should allocate special funds to carry out labor education. (7) Jia Dechao proposed that the entire road and bridges of Pudong Avenue should be quickly repaired to ensure safety and facilitate transportation. (8) Cao Jun and others proposed that the Municipal Government should immediately approve the allocation of 30 mu of public land in the Jiangwan district as the site for the Municipal Jiangwan Middle School. (9) Jiang Menglin and others proposed that since the construction site funds for the city's three museums (library, museum, and art museum) have been resolved, the Municipal Government should quickly establish a construction committee to determine the permanent scale. (10) Jiang Menglin and others proposed that the roads in the current Nanshi area be repaired. (11) Ou Jinzao and others proposed that the City Ferry should allocate a portion of its profits as public welfare funds for local construction. (12) Wang Ziyang and others proposed that the Jiazha Canal, which has already been resolved to be filled in, has not yet been completed, so a deadline should be set for completion to facilitate transportation.</p>
<h3>Mayor Wu Hosts Banquet for Xinjiang Delegation</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] The Xinjiang Delegation, which had passed through Shanghai from Tianjin the day before, is scheduled to leave for Beijing today to bid farewell to the central government leaders. Mayor Wu and Secretary-General Shen hosted a banquet yesterday afternoon at the Municipal Bank Building for Zasak Qunwang Dawa, National Representative Tu Leqian, and more than 30 other people. The gathering ended happily around 2:00 PM.</p>
<h3>New Director of the China Trust Bureau, Cheng Yuanfan, to Take Office in Two Days</h3>
<p>The Board of Directors of the Central Trust Bureau has appointed Cheng Yuanfan as the Director of the Bureau and urged him to take office immediately. Note: Mr. Cheng is scheduled to report to the Bureau on the 25th of this month.</p>
<h3>Confiscated Nylon Stockings Will Not Be Auctioned Domestically</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] In order to eliminate the source of nylon stockings, the Municipal Government has sent a letter to the Customs Office, requesting that confiscated nylon stockings no longer be auctioned domestically. As for all smuggled and dumped nylon stockings on the market, a plan has been agreed upon to ban sales completely after August 1st.</p>
<h3>Five Petitions: Hotel Industry Asks for Removal of Controls; Newspaper Employee's Residence Occupied</h3>
<p>Yesterday, at the second meeting of the sixth session of the Senate, there were five petitions: (1) The Hotel Industry Association, protesting that the industry is uniquely subject to price controls, requested that the authorities revoke the controls to maintain their livelihoods. (2) The Gold and Silver Industry Association requested that the price of buying and selling jewelry be calculated according to the foreign exchange settlement certificate. (3) Refugees and unemployed workers from Northern Jiangsu requested the issuance of rickshaw licenses. (4) Citizen Jin Xiang, who was injured in the leg by a Health Bureau vehicle, requested that the Bureau provide compensation. (5) Sun Yuan, an employee of Shen Bao, whose residence at No. 324 Fumin Road in Nanshi was forcibly occupied on the 6th of this month by Xu Lunfang, who claimed to be serving in the Special Higher Group of the Military Police Department, leading a crowd. As of 3:00 PM yesterday, more than ten people had intruded again. Sun, feeling unjustly wronged, petitioned the Senate.</p>
<h3>Snippets from Questioning: Commodity Price Policy is Like Performing "Catching and Releasing Cao Cao"; Mayor is "Shoulderless" on Security Issues</h3>
<p>For the past two days, the first Senator to sign in has consistently been Gao Shu'an.</p>
<p>On the opening day, someone suggested moving the afternoon meeting time from 3:00 PM to 2:30 PM, but the original 3:00 PM was maintained. The Speaker specifically emphasized "exactly" 3:00 PM, asking everyone to arrive "on time," and everyone applauded in agreement. However, there were still many people who arrived late yesterday.</p>
<p>Senator Jiang Haoran, who questioned the Mayor, delivered his questioning entirely as a performance, with intonation and cadence, and clear paragraphs, which was quite exemplary.</p>
<p>Senator Zhao Yangxiong, when talking about various unsatisfactory phenomena in education, said that this may be because Mayor Wu is not very interested in education.</p>
<p>Senator Fan Xipin, speaking with a Sichuan accent, said that Mayor Wu is "smooth" in his dealings, accommodating everyone, which was met with knowing smiles.</p>
<p>Senator He Chengfu, who raised questions yesterday, was the most impassioned and questioned for the longest time, not stepping down until the bell rang four times.</p>
<p>Senator He said: The Municipal Government is performing "Catching and Releasing Cao Cao" every day on policies such as commodity prices. Will there be any new policies in the future? He said: There are many security problems in Shanghai, such as the dance hall case, because the Mayor "lacks shoulders" (lacks responsibility).</p>
<p>He also said: Mayor Wu once proposed the slogan "Stabilize society and control commodity prices," but in the two years since the Mayor took office, society has become more unstable and commodity prices have become more unstable, increasing day by day. The Mayor replied awkwardly in his response: "I have never proposed such a slogan."</p>
<p>Mayor Wu said in response to someone pointing out that he is "smooth": "I have never been affiliated with any faction, so I don't want any faction when handling affairs. This may be the origin of the word "smooth"."</p>
<p>Among the questioning of various bureaus, the Finance Bureau was the most calm and peaceful. Director Tian took the stage and lightly addressed the issues before stepping down elegantly.</p>
<p>The focus of the fire was concentrated on the Public Utilities Bureau. When Director Zhao finished his response and was about to step down, he was "detained" by the Senators who stood up to question him, preventing him from stepping down. This happened repeatedly, as many as six times.</p>
<p>Senator Xu Zexiang, when questioning, said that the Nanshi area often experiences power outages, and said with emotion: "The citizens of Nanshi bear the same tax obligations, but the rights they enjoy are discriminated against. What is the reason?" This won a round of applause.</p>
<p>Yesterday's questioning was generally calm and peaceful, which can be said to be rare.</p>
<h3>Customs Employees Make Three Demands: Li Du Ding to Reply Today</h3>
<p>Approval to Borrow One Month's Salary with Installment Deductions</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] The Jianghai Customs strike has lasted for four days as of yesterday. Although some important businesses are still being handled as usual, imported ships cannot unload goods, which has a significant impact. It is reported that the Inspector General of Customs, Li Du, the Customs Commissioner, Zhang Yongnian, and the Director of the Customs Administration, Zhang Fuyun, who went to Beijing to seek instructions, have returned to Shanghai with the results and will convene all customs employees today to respond to their three demands: (1) Approval to borrow one month's salary, but must be deducted in installments. (2) Regarding the request to increase treatment equal to the Four Banks and Two Bureaus, the Customs itself has no right to decide and must wait for the Ministry of Finance to submit it to the Executive Yuan for discussion and determination before replying. (3) The Customs already has a training association, and the employee welfare association will be revoked or merged. If all employees can accept persuasion, work may resume today.</p>
<h3>Employee Reaction</h3>
<p>After customs employees learned that the Ministry of Finance had agreed to borrow one month's salary, they issued a written statement yesterday, stating: According to the current income of employees, the salary of junior employees is less than 200,000 yuan. A one-month loan is only worth one stone of white rice, and it is clear that it cannot alleviate the difficulties of employees, and it is unacceptable to our employees. As shown by past experience, borrowing money is not enough to solve the problem if the treatment problem is not completely improved. Therefore, in order to strive for a thorough improvement in treatment, we insist on our three demands. We will not resume work until the Customs authorities recognize the welfare association, improve treatment, and obtain definite guarantees.</p>
<h3>Suspicion of Gold and Foreign Currency in Tobacco Shop: Manager and Customers Detained and Interrogated</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] The Xiechang Tobacco Shop at No. 613 Sichuan Road was reported to be suspected of trading in black market gold and foreign currency. Yesterday, the Police Bureau's Economic Police Brigade sent personnel to search the shop. A five hundred million yuan check and five yuan each of US dollars and Hong Kong dollars were found on a visitor named Shi Zehui. Six US dollars and eight pieces of gold jewelry were found on another visitor named Yin Shuying. The suspects, along with the evidence and the shop manager, Liu Runming, were taken to the bureau for interrogation.</p>
<h3>Various Fees Collected by Jianghai Customs to be Doubled According to Current Amounts</h3>
<p>The Jianghai Customs has recently been ordered to double the collection of various fees (including local miscellaneous fees) from the 22nd onwards, in accordance with current amounts.</p>
<h3>Shanghai-Hong Kong Wireless Telephone to be Tested This Morning</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] Following the Sino-US and Sino-British wireless telephone calls, the Ministry of Transport's International Radio Station and Telecommunications Bureau are actively preparing for the Shanghai-Hong Kong line wireless telephone. It is learned that all machines have been installed, and the first test call will be made with Hong Kong this morning. If there are no unexpected obstacles, official calls can be made in mid-July. In the future, telephone calls between the United States and Hong Kong will also be switched through this city, so the opening hours must be coordinated with the Hong Kong-US line. The billing will be agreed with the Hong Kong government, and users in this city will pay in legal currency converted from Hong Kong dollars.</p>
<h3>Health Bureau Sends Personnel to Examine Zhang Dailin: To be Moved to the Municipal Hospital for Examination</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] The Shanghai health authorities are very interested in the mystery of the "Shanghai Yang Sister" who does not eat. Yesterday morning, the director of the Municipal Second Hospital, Zeng Yaozhong, the section chief of the Health Bureau, Zhu Yunda, the pharmacist Ding Daoyu, and the director of the health section, Li, accompanied by the physician Li Lin, went to the female physician Hua Shujun's clinic to examine her. Zhang Dailin still insisted that she had not eaten for nine years. Director Zeng asked a few questions and thought that it was too early to start research work now. The first step should be to determine whether Zhang is definitely not eating. To complete this step, she must be more closely monitored. Therefore, he suggested that Zhang be moved to the Municipal Second Hospital for a two-week examination to determine the truth of her not eating. Physicians Li and Hua and the section chief of the Health Bureau, Zhu, all agreed. After reporting to the Health Bureau, Zhang will be moved to the Municipal Second Hospital today if she has no objection.</p>
<p>Former Dance Girl Rescued from Throwing Herself into the River</p>
<p>The truth about Zhang's life has gradually been revealed yesterday. Zhang is also known as Feng Aiqin and used to be a dance girl in the Shanghai dance hall. She met a Mr. Xu who served in a bank and cohabited with him. Later, she left home for some reason two months ago. One night, she tried to commit suicide by throwing herself into the river and was rescued by Zhang Tianyi. Therefore, Zhang Tianyi is not her husband. It was only because the news of her not eating spread that he decided to pretend. The Health Bureau and the medical community do not pay much attention to Zhang's actual background, because her life is one thing, and whether she does not eat is another. Therefore, they will continue to explore the mystery of not being greedy.</p>
<h3>Post Office Holds Symposium on Postal Rates</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Postal Administration, considering that the current price index has risen more than 1 million times, while postal rates have only risen 100,000 times compared to the pre-war period, resulting in increasing postal losses, and in order to solicit opinions from all walks of life on the issue of postal rates, the Public Service Department of the Administration held a postal issue symposium, with postal rates as the theme. More than a dozen editors of various newspapers and economics experts attended. First, Director Li of the Administration announced the purpose of the symposium, followed by Secretary Xue Pinwen reporting on the postal revenue and expenditure and the reasons for postal losses. He said that the post office has made its best efforts in cutting expenditures and promoting business. At the same time, government subsidies are also limited, so the issue of price increases cannot but be considered. The editors of various newspapers and economics experts then expressed their opinions one after another, unanimously sympathizing with the postal fee increase, but hoping that the amount of increase for various types of mail should be differentiated. For example, printed matter, newspapers, and regular letters should be increased less, while express letters and registered letters may be increased more. If there are still losses after the increase in postal rates, the government can subsidize them.</p>

Judge Guo Zonggan presided over the hearing, and US Assistant Consul Stedman and Vice Consul Constance attended the hearing as observers. Alan testified in court that at 4:00 PM on May 29, he and his girlfriend, Yare Wang, rented a car from the Sichuan Automobile Military Company and instructed the driver, Sun Jiaxian, to drive to the Leyi Hotel on the Great West Road. However, Sun did not understand foreign languages and drove to the Huizhong, Jinmen, and Paramount hotels. As it was nearly 11:00 PM and they still had not reached their destination, he did not want him to continue driving. When they paid 4 million legal tender, Sun refused to accept it, claiming that the amount was too small. In anger, he punched him, and the next day, he heard that he had died. The family of the deceased demanded compensation for living expenses, to be paid according to the living index announced by the Municipal Government in the amount of 25,920 yuan. The court scheduled another hearing for the 12th of next month.</p>

<h3>Inspector of New City Branch Bureau Investigated for Malpractice</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] The District Prosecutor's Office opened a hearing yesterday regarding the case of Qin Yuanlong, an inspector of the New City Police Branch Bureau, who was accused of assisting the police in dereliction of duty and harming the people. According to the statement made by the plaintiff, Jiang Jiyuan: The plaintiff has been running the Yuanyuan noodle stall at the mouth of Alley 155, No. 2 North Central Road for 30 years. On December 18 of last year, police officers Jiang Heling (No. 1337) and Chen Baochang (No. 1521) went to the stall and ate two bowls of beef noodles. After eating, when the apprentice collected the money, Jiang refused to pay and beat the apprentice. The plaintiff filed a complaint with the District Prosecutor's Office, and the court sentenced him to 50 days of detention. This deepened the resentment. On May 15 of this year, the New City Branch Bureau suddenly received a report that Jiang was setting up a noodle stall at the mouth of the alley, obstructing fire control and traffic, and should be ordered to demolish it. Therefore, Inspector Qin Yuanlong and policeman Li demolished the plaintiff's stall and planned to detain the plaintiff for 5 days, so he filed a complaint.</p>

<h3>High Tide of Interpellations Concentrated on the Public Utilities Bureau Reason for Suspension of Route 7 Bus Service Due to Increasing Number of Fare Evaders</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the interpellations of various bureaus reached a climax at the Public Utilities Bureau. Interpellations came one after another, including those from Xu Ze, He Chengfu, Jiang Hao, and many others. Director Zhao answered them separately as follows: (1) The price adjustments of public utilities in April and May were reviewed by the representatives of the Participating Council. Because the Participating Council was investigating public utilities in June, it was inconvenient to participate. Therefore, the prices of various public utilities were increased by 35% first in June. Up to June, the various prices of public utilities had increased by an average of 279,000 times compared to before the war. The only solution now is to continue to try to ask the central government to approve the settlement of foreign exchange every three months to reduce the cost of materials for public utilities, thereby easing the burden on citizens. (2) There is insufficient electricity in Nanshi, Zhabei, and Pudong. Currently, 23,000 kilowatts of electricity are still being borrowed from the Shanghai Electric Power Company, but the Electric Power Company itself does not have enough. Recently, one of its generators broke down, so Nanshi often experiences power outages. (3) In addition to allocating more than 100 billion yuan in fines for exceeding electricity limits to the garrison旅, the remaining 50 to 60 billion yuan will be used to purchase materials. There is very little left. The municipal government will submit a detailed report on this. (4) The suspension of Route 7 bus service has been considered repeatedly. Recently, due to the difficulty in obtaining gasoline, and the fact that fare evaders account for 70% of the passengers on the route, it has only been temporarily suspended. (5) It was decided to complete the unified licenses exchange by the end of July. There are still more than 2,000 vehicles that have not been exchanged. (6) Due to traffic conditions and municipal regulations, tricycles照licenses cannot be issued anymore.</p>
<h3>Council, etc., Telegraph Request to Eliminate Professional Students Rescue Academic Integrity Smash Communist Conspiracy</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Council, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, the Municipal Farmers' Association, the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions, the Municipal Education Association, and other organizations jointly telegraphed President Jiang, Vice President Li, and Premier Weng yesterday, requesting that the Communist Party's professional students in various schools be quickly eliminated with the most severe measures to stabilize schools, rescue academic integrity, smash the Communist conspiracy, and safeguard the foundation of the nation. The original telegram reads: "To President Jiang in Nanjing, Vice President Li, Premier Weng: Since the victory, the Communist bandits have been rebelling with arms, destroying unity, injuring the nation's vitality, and obstructing transportation, causing prices to skyrocket and the people to suffer deeply. Recently, in order to coordinate with their military wandering and political harassment, they have instigated a majority of professional students to use anti-American and pro-Japanese sentiments as a pretext, but to destroy and disrupt as the reality, lurking in various schools. They bewitch and deceive classmates, entice and coerce them, and hold teachers hostage, insult them, act unreasonably, instigate unrest, call for strikes, and create a sense of panic throughout the country.</p>
<p>The United States' support of Japan is originally based on the extremely devastated national economy and people's livelihood in Japan after the war, and is an act of assistance and encouragement based on the humanitarian position that victorious countries should have. If it exceeds the limits of maintaining the survival of the Japanese people, we, learning from the past, should propose protests to the government in a reasonable manner, and should assist the government in launching diplomatic activities to win the understanding and sympathy of friendly countries for the current situation in China, in order to strengthen the implementation of aid to China and promote the success of our nation-building. However, they are not considering this, blindly attacking friendly countries, only knowing how to be anti-American and pro-Japanese, but not advocating that support for Japan should be limited, only knowing how to be anti-American and pro-Japanese, but not advocating to increase aid to China, and even slander the government, disrupt order, disturb people's hearts, lose international sympathy, and plunge our country into turmoil. Their intention is nothing more than to achieve their conspiracy to subvert the government and to achieve their goal of selling out the country.</p>
<p>To secure peace, one must first eliminate violence, and to make decisive choices is paramount. If the government is lenient again, then the professional students who are now lurking in various schools will be the internal line for the Communist bandits to disturb the country in the future, and the future of the country will also be ruined by them, not just sacrificing the studies of thousands of pure young people today. We are deeply aware of the crisis and feel heartbroken. Therefore, we specially telegraphed the above, respectfully requesting that you consider the situation and quickly order the education authorities to take measures to rectify the academic atmosphere with strict and urgent measures. While the front is intensifying the suppression of bandits, the rear must eliminate bandits. We especially hope that the Communist Party's professional students in various schools will be quickly eliminated with the most severe methods in order to stabilize schools, rescue academic integrity, smash the Communist conspiracy, and safeguard the precarious foundation of the nation. We are urgently telegraphing this, begging you to consider, adopt, and implement it. Shanghai Municipal Council, Municipal Chamber of Commerce, Municipal Farmers' Association, Municipal Federation of Trade Unions, Municipal Education Association." (Yang)</p>
<h3>Soaring Aircraft Fuel Prices Make it Difficult for Two Airlines Li Jinglu and Shanghai Merchants Seek Solutions Preliminary Resolution Reached in the Evening</h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] The recent surge in aviation gasoline prices, which are increasing wildly, has made it impossible for the two airlines in the city to cope with the difficulties by increasing fares intermittently. Therefore, they have requested that the Ministry of Transportation quickly seek a fundamental solution. It is learned that the Ministry of Transportation has sent Director Li Jinglu of the Civil Aviation Department to Shanghai, and he is closely studying countermeasures with relevant competent authorities. It is said that the methods are no more than two: either let the aviation fares track the oil prices and adjust automatically at any time, or allow the airlines to purchase oil at the state-set exchange rate, starting from stabilizing both oil prices and non-oil prices, and then easing the fares. At present, the aviation gasoline problem has reached an extremely serious situation. According to airline statistics, if February 7 of this year is taken as the base number, the oil price on the 21st of this month has increased to 1673%, the foreign exchange rate has increased to 1216%, and the cost of living index has increased to 354%. According to the aviation cost calculation formula, passenger and freight rates should have been increased to 1068%, but because the Ministry of Transportation has been reluctant to approve it, the increase has only been 369% so far, which is only slightly more than one-third of the amount that should have been increased. According to yesterday's oil prices, the total monthly revenue of the two airlines is not enough to pay for the oil costs for one month. In addition, the foreign exchange required for parts and equipment is even more serious.</p>
<p>[Another report] After Director Li Jinglu of the Civil Aviation Department of the Ministry of Transportation came to Shanghai from Beijing, he negotiated with the Central Bank all day yesterday and only reached a preliminary resolution in the evening. The Central Bank has agreed to lend a month and a half's worth of price difference based on actual gasoline needs (calculated at 755,000 yuan per gallon). It is heard that this will be guaranteed by the Ministry of Transportation. Therefore, the serious problem of a complete shutdown of flights on the 23rd has been temporarily resolved. Today, the flights on all routes will still operate as usual.</p>
<h3>Provisional Motions</h3>
<p>Recommend Representatives to Discuss Gasoline Supply Request Municipal Bank to Report on Operations</p>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] Two provisional motions were made before the adjournment of the meeting yesterday: (1) Zhang Zhongyuan and others proposed sending five representatives to participate in the meeting to discuss increasing gasoline supply to be held at the Municipal Government on the 23rd in order to solve the current traffic problem. Resolution: Authorize the Public Utilities Mediation Committee to decide. (2) Chu Shun and others proposed that the Municipal Bank report on its business situation and determine its organizational structure. Resolution: It is not harmful to schedule a time to first invite the bank to send representatives to attend the meeting to report on the bank's business situation. The case will be submitted to the relevant subcommittee for review and then put to discussion.</p>

<h3>Money Market Trend Apparently Loose, But Actually Tight New Prices Repeatedly Seen in the Commodity Market</h3>
<p>After the settlement period, the trends of various commodity markets yesterday all showed a rapid rise. The black market for gold and banknotes saw even higher prices. Although the money market was more active than before, the market sentiment was stimulated by the war situation, and the bulls were pulling up strongly, so new prices were repeatedly seen for various commodities. Although yarn and cloth continued to be rationed, it was still difficult to stop the price increases. Since the authorities lifted the price limit on white japonica rice, the price continued to rise sharply yesterday, with door sales reaching 15 million yuan. In addition, factory silk and daily necessities all increased in price.</p>
<p>Yesterday's money market in this city was apparently loose but actually tight because the price increases had not subsided, and those who had funds were all scrambling to buy materials, which made the trend tighter. In the bill exchange of the money shops, the four banks, two bureaus, and one treasury still had a huge net transfer, totaling 1,498.8 billion. Among them, the Central Bank had a net inflow of 840.8 billion, the Bank of China had a net outflow of 536.8 billion, the Bank of Communications had a net inflow of 180.5 billion, the Farmers Bank had a net inflow of 127.3 billion, the Central Trust Bureau had a net inflow of 582.6 billion, the Postal Remittances Bureau had a net inflow of 46.3 billion, the Central Cooperative Treasury had a net inflow of 252.1 billion, the commercial banks had a net outflow of 649.2 billion in large exchanges and a net outflow of 1306 billion in small exchanges, and the foreign banks had a total net inflow of 450.1 billion.</p>
<h3>Lifting Price Controls Solidifies Rising Sentiment Rice Prices Continue to Skyrocket</h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] Rice prices in the northern and southern rice markets rose sharply yesterday, averaging about 1 million yuan per stone higher than last week. Except for the price limit on medium indica rice, which could not exceed 10 million yuan per stone, the municipal authorities lifted the price limits on the rest, and the market sentiment was exceptionally high. According to Chief Ji of the Food Section of the Social Affairs Bureau, "The reason for lifting the price limit is that the prices in the producing areas are higher than in Shanghai, and merchants cannot make a profit, so the import of rice has decreased, which will inevitably lead to a rice shortage and cause serious consequences, so we have to lift the price limit. However, in order to take care of the common people, so that they can buy rice within 10 million yuan, we have set a price limit of 9.8 million yuan per stone for medium indica rice. As for the supply rice, we still sold 6,000 stone yesterday, and the price was still 9.2 million yuan per stone. The People's Mediation Committee also sent many personnel to various rice shops to monitor, in order to prevent the rice from flowing into the black market."</p>
<p>Yesterday's rice prices in the Southern Market: White japonica rice 13.2 million yuan, thin indica rice 13.4 million yuan, early rice 12.8 million yuan, wild indica rice 11.5 million yuan. Rice prices in the Northern Market: White japonica rice 13.9 million yuan, thin indica rice 13.7 million yuan, early rice 13.2 million yuan, sheep indica rice 13.5 million yuan. A total of 8,188 stone of rice arrived at the northern and southern markets. Including 6,000 stone of supply rice, the total amount of rice flowing into the market yesterday was 14,188 stone.</p>
<p>Flour is rising steadily. "Bingshuan" flour opened at 4.1 million yuan, and because the price of rice showed signs of weakening, it was raised to 4.45 million yuan, the same increase of 150,000 yuan as "Lao Che" flour. "Jian Cheng" and "Hong Feng" flour each increased by 130,000 yuan. Large-package wheat bran sold for 3.8 million yuan, an increase of 350,000 yuan. Wheat sold for 6 million yuan.</p>
<p>Coarse grains rose and fell alternately. Soybeans struggled to rise in the morning. "Zha Dou" fell slightly by 200,000 yuan, while "Ben Dou" rose by 100,000 yuan. Corn from the northern gangs was not purchased, and the market fell by 700,000 yuan. Sesame fell sharply by more than 2 million yuan. Raw peanuts from Dawenkou rose by 1 million yuan, and those from Xuzhou increased by 500,000 yuan, while the rest remained flat. Picked white beans fell slightly by 200,000 yuan, and mung beans increased by 500,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Edible oil was flat and weak. Qingdao Jishi barrel oil sold for 41.5 million yuan, slightly higher by 500,000 yuan. The factory's own soybean oil opened at 29.5 million yuan and steadily increased to 30.4 million yuan, slightly higher by 200,000 yuan. Rapeseed oil was lower by 200,000 to 300,000 yuan. Jishi small barrel and old barrel熟菜油熟 rapeseed oil each fell slightly by 500,000 yuan. Soybean cake汕帮from Shantou still had demand, supply and demand were equal, and the market was stable.</p>
<h3>Shanghai's Monthly Edible Oil Consumption is About 40,000 Dan</h3>
<p>[Report from our Nanjing, 22nd] Ministry of Economic Affairs news: According to a survey by the China Vegetable Oil Plant, the total amount of edible oil needed in Shanghai each month is more than 40,000 dan. Judging from the oil extraction equipment in Shanghai, it can produce 140,000 tons of oil per month, but due to funding and electricity issues, only one-third of the machines are currently in operation, so the edible oil produced is only enough for consumption in areas such as Beijing and Shanghai.</p>
<h3>Sugar Quotas Increase</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market initially tightened and then softened because the Taiwan Company标特綿白biaote mianbai allocated in large quantities. The allocation price was 18 million yuan, and a total of 45,200+ bags were allocated. Some were allocated on the same day. The highest price was 18.35 million yuan, and the lowest was 17.8 million yuan. The calculation still needs to lose money. Other rises and falls were not much. Local sugar was slightly tight, rising by 700,000 to 1.2 million yuan, and the market may stabilize.</p>
<h3>Green Tea Market Stable</h3>
<p>Recently, the tea market has seen significant increases because those holding goods are unwilling to lag behind and have begun to sell. Especially for green tea, in addition to exporters actively searching for "Da Bang" and other types of tea, this year's Longjing tea, both in the main street and in the rural villages, is being bought regardless of price, and the selling price is becoming more vigorous.</p>
<p>It is learned that Qimen black tea has recently been gradually planned to be purchased and absorbed in the main street, but the market inventory is insufficient, so the bottom is very strong.</p>
<h3>Artificial Silk Prices Fluctuate Factory-Processed Silk Goods Jump</h3>
<p>The price of artificial silk fluctuated greatly yesterday, rising and falling suddenly. Due to tightening credit and uncertain sentiment, the result was still 50 million yuan higher than last Saturday. The price of 120 gold Sanma有光youguang opened at 740 million yuan in the morning, rising steadily, reaching a maximum of 810 million yuan, and closing at 770 million yuan for the selling price at noon. The lowest price in the afternoon was 740 million yuan, and the price rebounded to 530 million yuan at the close.</p>
<p>The market for factory-processed silk goods jumped yesterday. B-grade goods shouted prices close to 1 billion yuan, but because the price was too high, buyers were restrained, so transactions were rare. D-grade goods were traded for 910 million yuan in the morning. Scattered odd lots were priced at 50 million yuan. The asking price for scattered lots of "Qian Jing" was also as high as 700 million yuan. The market was slightly weak in the afternoon due to the fall in artificial silk, but there were no transactions.</p>
<p>The silk market rose rapidly yesterday. The opening price of "Hua Qiang" real silk quilt covers was as high as 395 million yuan in the morning, with a maximum of 970 million yuan, then fell to around 900 million yuan, and then fell to 87 million yuan at the close for the spot price. The opening price for the "Ge Zi Bi Zou" warehouse order was 1.48 million yuan, and the closing price was 450,000 yuan. The market was also slightly weak outside the market in the afternoon due to the general decline in raw materials.</p>

<h3>The Atmosphere in the Cotton Yarn Market is Highly Inflated The Price of 42-Count Fine Yarn Approaches the 700 Million Mark</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the cotton yarn market was driven by a favorable environment, and market sentiment was exceptionally high. Buyers from Tianjin, Guangdong, and other regions were actively purchasing, and trading unfolded in the market. Holders took the opportunity to drive up prices, and the opening price of 42-count "Lan Feng" fine yarn in the morning jumped by 60 million yuan. Later, with the rise in cloth prices, buyers absorbed everything on offer, and the market price soared again, once approaching the 700 million yuan mark. As the closing approached, those with floating profits settled on the day, and scattered sellers took advantage of the high prices to sell off. Credit tightened, and the cloth market fell slightly, eventually closing at 675 million yuan. This was a sharp increase of 50 million yuan compared to before the holiday. The prices of other coarse and fine yarns also improved by 40-50 million to 70-80 million yuan.</p>
<p>Yesterday's cloth market opened at high levels, carrying over the strong momentum from the outside market the day before. The initial opening price of 12-pound "Longtou" fine cloth rose sharply by 120-130 million yuan. Later, with news of purchases by the "Ke Bang" buyers, demand became robust. Around 10:30, a new high price of 149 million yuan was created. When news of a large-scale sell-off by the authorities was heard, those with floating profits sold off, and traders also resold, so the price fell back to 146 million yuan at the close, which was a sharp increase of 16 million yuan compared to before the holiday. The markets for other cloths were also very firm and high. After the close, credit suddenly tightened on all sides, sentiment turned weak, and bulls started to sell off. Outside the market, the price decreased to 144 million yuan and then even sold down to 140 million yuan for "Longtou" cloth, and the prices of other cloths also fell from the closing prices.</p>

<h3>High Prices Difficult to Sustain: Chinese Stocks Close Weak</h3>
<p>Chinese stocks, though propelled to high prices yesterday by materials and Hong Kong Electric, could not sustain the gains. The threat of tight credit conditions and the National Bank's heavy selling of materials led to a weak close.</p>
<p>The morning opened steady due to high real goods prices. Wing Spinning debuted at $4240, advancing to $4375. Due to increased supply, it gradually weakened.

<p>In the afternoon, Wing Spinning opened at $4310. Numbers 245 and 157 were sold off, causing a drop to $4190. Numbers 71 and 205 were bought, but the National Bank's intervention was limited, leading to a rebound to $4275. Numbers 116 and 190 were sold, forcing another drop to $4200. The closing price was $4235. Compared to the morning close, Huaxin underwear fell by half a percent, China-France and Xinguang remained flat, and the rest experienced small declines.

<p>Government bonds fell yesterday, with trading volume remaining around 4 million. Series C started at 640,000 in the morning, falling to a low of 530,000 before stabilizing slightly.

<h3>Private Universities Have Their Own Traditional Characteristics: Ministry of Education Adopts Grant-in-Aid Policy; Hang Liwu Speaks on the Nationalization of Kwang Hwa and Great China Universities</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing, 22nd Dispatch] Vice Minister of Education Hang Liwu, on the 22nd, spoke on the matter of Kwang Hwa and Great China Universities requesting nationalization, stating: "Since the restoration, given the lack of manpower and material resources, the government has decided not to establish new national universities in the short term. Due to financial difficulties and the urgent need to strengthen existing national schools, it is impossible to nationalize private schools. China has vast territory, and if universities rely solely on state sponsorship, it will be difficult to achieve the goal of educational and cultural development. Therefore, the Ministry has always adopted a policy of awarding, assisting, and cultivating private universities. Furthermore, private universities have their own traditional characteristics and should be allowed to develop freely. The government will do its best to assist private schools in terms of funding and other aspects. The expectation of private school students to obtain public funding after nationalization is also impossible. The public funding system has now been changed to scholarships, and students who did not receive public funding originally will not be eligible for it simply because of nationalization."</p>
<p>[Another Dispatch] A student delegation from Great China University, including Ma Yunda and five others, petitioned the Ministry of Education on the 22nd regarding the request for nationalization. Director Tang of the Higher Education Department received them and promised to convey their opinions.</p>

<h3>Tsinghua University: Currently Has Five Colleges, Twenty-Six Departments, and Twenty-Three Graduate Institutes</h3>
<p>[Our Beiping, 1st Air Dispatch] Tsinghua is probably the most suitable university for studying in the country. The professors, facilities, campus, and traditions are all the best.</p>
<p>Tsinghua has changed its name three times so far. It was founded three years before the founding of the Republic of China, using the surplus Boxer Indemnity returned by the United States as a condition for sending students to study in the United States, and was initiated by the Bureau of Educational Missions to the United States. At that time, there were only secondary and higher courses. After the founding of the Republic of China, Tsinghua became an independent school. Its university foundation was formed in the fourteenth year of the Republic of China, when it began to enroll freshmen. The graduation of these students ended its nature as a preparatory school for studying in the United States and became a complete university. In the seventeenth year of the Republic of China, the Northern Expedition of the National Revolutionary Army was successful, and it was renamed National Tsinghua University by a resolution of the National Government. In the eighteenth year, a graduate school was added, and the equipment in various departments was gradually completed. During this period, Yen Hui-ching, Tang Guoan, Zhou Yichun, and Luo Jialun successively presided over the school's administration. The current president, Mei Yi-qi, entered the school in the fourth year of the Republic of China and assumed the position of president in the twentieth year. In the twenty-first year, the College of Engineering was added, and in the twenty-third year, preparations were made to establish the College of Agriculture, gradually completing the current scale.</p>
<p>In the twenty-sixth year, the Lugouqiao Incident occurred, and Tsinghua moved south, initially joining with Peking University and Nankai University in Changsha to form the Temporary University. In the twenty-seventh year, it moved to Yunnan and was reorganized into the Southwest Associated University. After the victory, it moved back to Beiping. Two years of construction have restored the old appearance of Tsinghua.</p>
<p>Tsinghua currently has five colleges, twenty-six departments, and twenty-three graduate institutes. It can be called a perfect university in terms of scale, and there are many first-class professors. President Mei Yi-qi, Provost Wu Zelin, and Dean of Student Affairs Chu Shiquan are all well-known scholars in the country and do not need much introduction. In terms of professors, Feng Youlan, Zhu Ziqing, Chen Yinke, Wu Mi, Wu Han, and Pei Wenzhong in the College of Liberal Arts; Ye Qisun, Yang Wuzhi, Wu Youxun, Chen Zhen, and Yuan Fuli in the College of Science; Chen Daisun, Zhang Xiruo, and Pan Guangdan in the College of Law; Liu Xianzhou, Shi Jiazheng, Zhuang Qianding, and Liang Sicheng in the College of Engineering; Tang Peisong, Dai Fanglan, and Liu Chongle in the College of Agriculture; and Ma John in the Department of Physical Education are all first-class famous professors. Professor governance is the tradition of Tsinghua. The highest authority is the University Council, composed of the president and heads of various departments, which decides on administrative policies. The Professors' Council decides on teaching, research, and improvements in academic atmosphere. Furthermore, there are twenty-five committees established according to the needs of school affairs, in addition to five academic committees and five academic publications.</p>
<p>Generally, Tsinghua is most valued for its simple and honest academic atmosphere, which is free of bureaucratic airs. The students are generally of a high standard, and all are fortunate to be able to enter Tsinghua. The professors all have small houses on campus where they can teach in peace, unaffected by external disturbances. The school can also understand the feelings of teachers and students and does not interfere excessively. Everyone regards Tsinghua Garden as their own home, so it is not uncommon to find faculty and staff who have served at Tsinghua for ten or twenty years. Professors can take a one-year sabbatical after seven years of service. Yang Yezhi, Yu Ruihuang, Zhang Yintang, Xu Yutan, Tao Baokai, Xun Shuping, Wu Liusheng, and Huang Ziqing will be on sabbatical next semester. All of the above are funded by the school to study in the United States. In addition, Zhu Ziqing, Zhang Xiruo, and Wu Han are on sabbatical in the country. Liu Chongle, Wu Dayuan, Fan Xujun, and Ye Kai will soon return from their sabbaticals.</p>
<p>Provost Wu Zelin said that Tsinghua is striving for balanced development in all departments. Generally, the College of Engineering is considered to be more famous. Tsinghua has departments such as the Department of Sociology, Department of Anthropology, Department of Architectural Engineering, Department of Plant Pathology, Department of Agronomy, and Department of Meteorology, which are not found in other schools.</p>
<p>Tsinghua currently has a total of 2,500 students. About 300 will graduate this year, and the summer enrollment will not exceed 500. In the past, graduates had excellent career prospects, with each graduate having three to five job opportunities. Last year, due to the influence of the situation, engineering students still had two opportunities to choose from, while law students had an average of one in four. This year, it is a luxury for each engineering student to have one opportunity, and the situation is even worse for other departments. Until now, few people have shown interest.</p>
<p>Public funding for new students has been discontinued, and in the future, they can only compete for "public funding" within the 20% quota for scholarships. Students from "difficult areas" can receive relief funds. In addition, the Christian student commune can assist some students in exchanging work for meals. The school allocates them more than 20 acres of land, and the income can support dozens of people. It is conceivable that their lives will become increasingly difficult in the future.

<h3>World Games Four Wins in Four Matches, Defeated Dagong Last Night</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] The World Games basketball team's fourth match in Shanghai, although not played with full strength last night, still defeated Dagong with a score of 53 to 42. The first half was 28 to 19. World Games team coordination still needs improvement, relying solely on individual skills to win. Of the players, Huang Tianxi performed the best. Li Shiqiao's passing is still the key to the offense, but his shooting seemed less brilliant than in previous matches. Dagong's loss of Wen Hua and Zhong Qiang, its two supporting pillars, greatly affected its strength. Offense and defense were full of loopholes, and Tu Wenlong was out of form, with only one out of ten long and short shots hitting the mark. Dagong remained at a disadvantage throughout.</p>
<p>The match began at 7:10 PM, refereed by Wang Yiqiao and Xuan Hegao. Wen Hua of the World Games team was injured in the hand, Zhong Qiang was injured in the foot, and Yu Jin mistakenly reported. Li Shiqiao, Cheng Zhang, Zhi Jun, Tian Xi, and Song Yuan were deployed at the last minute. Dagong countered with Cai Jindian, Wu Kangkai, Tu Wenlong, Huang Boling, and Cai Lianke. The World Games team got the ball, made three quick passes, and Jia Zhijun scored under the basket, taking the lead. Tian Xi scored two points using his smoke screen technique. Adi scored two points under the basket, making it 6 to 0. Boling made one free throw, recording the first point for Dagong. The World Games team led all the way, and when the score was 16 to 7, Dagong's new player Xu Zhongyi replaced Lianke. When the difference was six goals at 22 to 10, Dagong took a time-out. Lianke was replaced by Kangkai. As the first half was about to end, Wenlong and Zhongyi scored three points, reducing the score to 19 to 28.</p>
<p>After a short break, Rui Zhang entered the game for the World Games team, and Adi was substituted out. Lao Bao scored, and Jindian immediately returned the favor. Boling made another shot, making the score 26 to 33, creating a tense situation with only five points separating the teams. This was the heyday of Dagong. Adi returned, replacing Rui Zhang, and the situation gradually improved. The scoring was steady, and after 44 to 33, the game became a back-and-forth affair, maintaining a difference of around five goals. The final score was 53 to 42, with the World Games team winning four victories.</p>

<h3>Green Window Night Talk</h3>
<p>— Zhao Qingge</p>
<p>It's rare to have such a cool evening, and such tranquility. I count the sounds from my desk, as it "tick-tocks," recounting to me many smoky past events, also telling me of an infinitely ethereal future. I don't like dwelling on the past, nor do I like longing for the future; I only want to settle into the present, because I am living in this most real present.</p>
<p>Everyone has their own different attitudes towards life, each has their own different philosophical concepts; thus, each has their own different way of life. Based on my own way of dealing with the world and philosophical concepts, I arrived at this way of life of "settling into the present." To me, it brings absolute peace of mind, but my friends see it as out of touch with the trend, too passive.</p>
<p>Lately, friends have been directly or indirectly asking me, asking why I am no longer seen at any literary gatherings? Asking why I don't participate in any social activities? Asking why I don't even go to entertainment venues? Some readers have also written, asking why my articles are published less frequently, whether I have already changed careers and stopped writing.</p>
<p>I know that friends and readers are concerned about me, which is why they raise so many questions to challenge me. In addition to expressing my heartfelt gratitude, I take advantage of this cool and peaceful night, sitting by the window, bathed in the bright moonlight, and tentatively open my heart to frankly talk to you about my recent situation. I don't want you to misunderstand me, but I also don't hope you pity me.</p>
<p>I said, I'm becoming someone who just wants to settle into the present—when I discovered that there was not much hope left in this world, and that one's past and future had turned to dust, I resolutely took this rather selfish path. By doing this, I neither create conflict with others, nor do I make myself dirty, remaining still and quiet. I am grateful for this great era filled with neverending warfare, as it awakened my soul.</p>
<p>In the past, during the turbulent eight years of the national war of resistance, I was not without excitement; for the supreme ideal, I devoted my heart and soul amidst the gunfire, I wrote tirelessly thousands upon thousands of words of struggle, and I participated with friends in all meaningful social activities. I was originally an enthusiastic and vigorous person!</p>
<p>However, eight years later, victory came, but the country was still turbulent! And even more clouded and bleak! Friends, people's hearts are scattered, no one is as closely connected as before, and no one's situation is so simple. Literary gatherings have become empty social gatherings, and social activities are always fruitless. Everyone's ideals gradually disappeared in the storms!</p>
<p>Thus I say: past efforts have turned to dust, and future pursuits are still a pile of dust.</p>
<p>In view of this, I can only settle into the present. I discarded all heroic ideas that I knew would become dust, and made my spirit and emotions detach from the world, living a peaceful life in a self-centered realm.</p>
<p>Don't compete with things; don't compete with people; with few desires, there are fewer worries. For example, recently the landlord sued me, forcing me to move out. I can only let the law punish me and I am too lazy to spend energy to deal with those coercing me. When rice and flour prices rise, I am used to being a vegetarian anyway. I can barely make a living with a pen from vegetables and coarse rice. It's only the price of cigarettes that gives me a headache! Quit? It's been more than ten years, it's not easy, and it's too abusive to myself; moreover, inspiration is related. Don't quit? It costs more than food. Therefore, the cigarette problem has really troubled me these past two days.</p>
<p>Dancing, I played with it for a while, but later I felt that it was like drinking, getting drunk once in a while is okay, but getting drunk often is meaningless. It is better to watch a good movie. Otherwise, I'd rather play dominoes alone, "Passing Five Gates", "Capturing Meng Huo" to forget the fatigue of the day.</p>
<p>Who says I don't write articles anymore? Before I learn other life skills, I will not change careers. But it is true that I don't publish casually. If selling a manuscript can sustain me for some days, then during this period I will specialize in writing things that I like, regardless of whether publishers will accept them in the future, I just need to be happy when I look at them.</p>
<p>That's how I live a very stable life now—and I seize this "present" "stability".</p>
<p>The so-called "conforming to the trend", in this era of unclear right and wrong, and perverse actions, has no standard. The trend is moving towards a democratic and peaceful road, but ambitious people insist on running in the opposite direction. Do you force yourself to go straight? There are thorns and bushes ahead. Do you also seek to curry favor with those in power? Conscience does not allow it. So you can only stop at the right time and follow the ancient saying: "Mingzhe baoshen," or "The wise protect themselves."</p>
<p>I do not deny that this attitude of dealing with the world is somewhat pessimistic, but where has my heroism gone? It has been worn away by the infinitely cruel facts—those cruel facts, like maggots, gnawing away at my vitality year after year, making me too tired to fight against the demons who create cruel facts! But, who can know that my pessimism is not a kind of cultivation; a kind of patience; a kind of accumulating strength? Therefore, I do not admit that my pessimism is surrender, or even shame.</p>
<p>I often think: Silence may not be a kind of silent revenge. I don't even want to complain anymore. I hate the current reality so much that I don't bother to ask about it anymore. I transcend my thoughts and emotions to another realm. I want to extricate myself from deep love and hate, in order to settle into the present—</p>
<p>The clock is always ticking non-stop, it is working hard to push away the night, but also actively pulling tomorrow closer, but it itself cannot understand how far the distance is in between? It seems like a blind horse, forever galloping in the endless abyss, galloping towards the end of the world.</p>
<p>In the silence, I see my heart is also ticking like the clock, ticking so evenly, so peacefully, and yet so endlessly, ticking! Ticking—until my doomsday comes.</p>
<p>The moon has drilled into the clouds, the night is deep!</p>
<p>Let the clock continue to tick with this heart, but my rambling must end here.</p>
<p>(The fifth day after the Dragon Boat Festival in the thirty-seventh year)</p>
<h3>Thoughts Inspired by Yang Mei</h3>
<p>— Xie Bingying</p>
<p>Speaking of it, it's a bit embarrassing. Yang Mei's nine years without eating is considered a great miracle in the world, so from the chairman of the province to doctors, nurses, scholars, celebrities, as well as peddlers and laborers, everyone is paying attention to this news, and I don't know how many people are thinking of becoming the second Yang Mei. In fact, being able to live without eating is not such an amazing thing. Don't we often see news in the newspapers about the late Saint Gandhi's fasts? He often fasted for ten or twenty days at a time. At that time, why didn't anyone study how Gandhi could live without eating? And with a normal spirit, just like peacetime, he could still look at official business and handle all daily affairs?</p>
<p>When I was in my teens, I often saw many people from Xinhua County or Baoqing Prefecture walking to Mount Heng in Nanyue to offer incense. Some offered blood basin incense, some offered musk incense, some offered mourning incense (incense promised due to illness before death must still be offered after death). There was a special kind called "hunger incense". Those offering incense, regardless of men, women, old or young, from the eve of departure until the day of their return, no matter how many days passed, could not taste anything, not even the cold water from the shopkeeper. Each of them had a dipper like a wine cup inserted on their neck. When they encountered a waterfall or a particularly clean spring, they would use the dipper to scoop up some water to drink, and they did not feel any hunger at all, and like the others, they could run eighty or ninety miles a day. The most rare thing was that some old women in their fifties or sixties, with their bound feet with three-inch golden lotuses, could also run eighty or ninety miles a day without eating anything. In their view, everything was naturally blessed by the Bodhisattva. At that time, a story like this was most popular: An old man went to Nanyue to offer hunger incense. When he walked halfway, he was so hungry that he could no longer bear it. He secretly picked a peach on the road and ate it. Unexpectedly, as soon as the peach entered his mouth and was crushed, the man vomited violently and died immediately. Beside him, the pieces of peach he vomited out suddenly turned into a complete peach, so that passers-by knew that he had died suddenly because of stealing food.</p>
<p>Of course, this is 100% superstition and absolutely unreliable! But the fact that people who offer hunger incense do not eat anything is an ironclad fact, just like those who offer worship incense, some kneel every three steps and bow every five steps. Such troublesome and arduous movements, he does not mess up a step, nor does he feel tired, and walking does not become slower than others. Sometimes they walk faster than ordinary people. When people offering worship incense pass by, children are particularly happy to watch, because their clothing is special. Their heads are tied with blue cloth and tied with red ribbons, they wear red bibs on their chests, and the movements of kneeling and getting up are particularly fast, as light and swift as a dragonfly skimming the water. Each of them holds a small stool for inserting incense, all lacquered red, which is extremely fun. The villagers said that these incense-offering people are not hungry or tired because the Bodhisattva is showing his spirit. In fact, this is entirely a mental effect. If we look at the biographies of many scientists and artists, they often devote themselves to a certain problem with all their heart and soul, and they will forget to eat and sleep. During the War of Resistance, how many soldiers could not eat a grain of rice or drink a sip of water for three or four consecutive days on the front line. They still shot at the enemy on the front line and charged into battle. People can cope with the environment. When there is no food to eat, he can not eat. When there is a need to take risks, the courage will be particularly great.</p>
<p>Our country is a country where feudal forces have dominated society for the longest time, so there are various sayings about being able to survive without eating. I saw an old Taoist in Mao Nu Cave in Mount Hua who had not eaten for ten years. His abstaining from grains was to get rid of worldly existence and become an immortal. He was already more than seventy years old, but he looked only like he was in his fifties. His body was very strong, and the skin on his face was the same as that of ordinary people, and he did not appear particularly anemic or haggard. He eats fruits from trees and ferns from the ground. Walnuts, pine nuts, and Chinese ginseng are all special products of Mount Hua. Each year, in addition to a small portion being provided to the old Taoist who abstains from grains, at least three or four thousand catties are sold to tourists. Our scientists should have studied why they can live long lives by eating only these plants.</p>
<p>Finally, I would like to talk about my own experience of hunger. The first time I studied at Shanghai Art University, I was so poor that I was hungry for three days. I only drank tap water and did not eat anything. The second time I was in the French Concession police station, I didn't eat a single meal or drink a drop of water for three whole days. According to my experience, not eating is still bearable, but not drinking water is simply deadly! Especially in summer, water is the source of life. Without water, people will die of thirst! When I was in prison in Japan, I didn't eat for a week. I only drank a small glass of water every day. I watched the prisoners in the same cell eating with relish, but I turned a blind eye and did not feel any appetite at all. Why did I have to fast at that time? On the one hand, because the rice cooked with those moldy rice was really unbearable to swallow, and the stinky fish placed on the bento box made me vomit at the sight of it. I asked them to give me bread, but they ignored me, so I stubbornly refused to eat: first, to show them my protest, and second, I also wanted to do an experiment on myself to see how many days I could go without eating and whether I would starve to death. If I starved to death, it would save the Japanese imperialists from insulting me and shooting me again, wouldn't that be great? During these seven days, because I originally had stomach problems, I did not feel the pressure of hunger at all. The most unbearable thing was thirst. I wanted to drink water—sometimes my throat was so dry that fire came out, and it seemed that my intestines were about to be burned off. At this time, if someone gave me a cup of sewage from a ditch, or even someone else's urine, I might drink it without hesitation.</p>
<p>Speaking of science, I am an amateur, and I am also anxious for our scientists! It has been more than a month, why hasn't any breakthrough been researched about Yang Mei? In particular, I am very surprised that Provincial Chairman Yang only pays attention to the problem of Yang Mei's not eating, but ignores the problem of the poor people in Sichuan Province not having food to eat. Just as I was writing this, the newspaper boy brought the newspaper. The news of the rice riots in Chongqing was published on the first page of the Beiping Daily, along with an editorial. This is not only a serious problem in Chongqing, but also a serious problem in all parts of the country. I hope that all scientists, politicians, scholars, and celebrities who are studying Yang Mei, if they cannot find out the reason, should abandon Yang Mei as soon as possible, let her resume her freedom and live her original life, and turn their eyes to the more than 300 million poor people. How can we enable them to survive? I think this is the only biggest problem in China at present! (Written in the old capital on June 18, 1937)</p>

<h3>Tiannan Hermit Wang Tao's Extant Poems: Miscellaneous Feelings in Shanghai, Eight Poems</h3>
<p>Holding back the payment of soldier's salaries is without end, building temporary walls while the bandits are not yet captured, Heaven lends the chief criminal a white head, great disasters emerge as refined gold; continuous camps make soldiers old, and many voices fill the wilderness with wrong notes; my eyes see the Southeast's overall situation ruined, alone I stroke my short hair and sigh sorrowfully.</p>
<p>Spring has few sunny days in March, and it is difficult for hundreds of thousands of soldiers to make a decisive battle; the military spirit is not high, and heavy rain sinks in, omens of killing have appeared as strict frost; I already know that celestial phenomena concern the current situation, and I hope that talents will plan for stability and security; today we must plan attack and defense strategies, and the key to prevention is to decide the rushing waves.</p>
<p>The exhausted enemy knows that Wei and Zhao are connected, and secretly appears from Yinping; they only seek a slow death and stake everything, not expecting simultaneous defeats in surrounding cities; broken aiding armies continue the war, and the neighboring soldiers guarding the walls are frightened three times a day; originally Wu and Yue were like lips and teeth, and when the bandits retreat, they all hear celebrations of rebirth.</p>
<p>The worries for Wu and Yue are great, and the Southeast has rested for half the country; the people of four counties are all caught in banditry, and a hundred years of killing fortune begins in autumn; He Xun's body leaves the Jiangbiao, and Tao Kan's army still descends upstream, wanting to knock on the camp gate to offer strange strategies, and writing on life with an unfavorable fate.</p>
<p>Suddenly seeing beacon fires in Jiangnan, I suddenly hear of soldiers in the far north; the pole star is worried about losing its position, and the soldiers surrounding the city suddenly empty their camps; sticking to the middle of peace and war was originally not a plan, and begging for alliances does not begin with kindness and prestige; I am in difficulties and danger, and he is arrogant, and from now on, there will be matters on the sea frontier.</p>
<p>Often thinking of stepping into the sea, I worry about whales, wanting to return home full of tigers and wolves, my life is exhausted and I only lack death, and the world is full of events and it is also in vain; my former friends are now soldier ghosts, the old lakes and mountains are new battlefields, wanting to find a clean land in front of me, a wave of dusk soaks the setting sun.</p>
<p>The corner is still a safe place, and avoiding trouble can still be a tenant, worrying about the world, can Jia Yi truly be lacking; and arguing to be thin with Yang Xiong; ten thousand places of war and massacre grieve the new robbery, and generations of literature have changing winds; bitterly speaking to you, what strategy will you use to assist prosperity?</p>
<p>Able to fight for fortune to help the declining situation, to quell difficulties and create this side; since ancient times, generals were born in troubled times, hearing that they are already enrolled in military ranks; the imperial court repeatedly orders to search for hermits, and what kind of people in the wilderness move the temple corridors; worldly affairs are truly ruined from this, tiredly opening my sleepy eyes and reading the changing world.</p>

<h3>Recent World Literary Scene</h3>
<p>— Zhao Jingshen</p>
<p>New research on Arnold</p>
<p>The great British critic Matthew Arnold is, besides Dickens, the most worthy of our attention in the Victorian era, and he still lives in our hearts to this day. He is being studied by many people. Biographies about him will not be much of a failure. His personal life is very dull, almost indescribable, so the biographers focus on introducing his thoughts or extracting his articles, so it won't be dull. In the past, although we had Lionel Trilling's satisfying and detailed research that had received the sympathy and praise of Saintsbury, and C. B. Tinker and Howard F. Lowry's continued research, we still don't mind having two new books of research on Arnold.</p>
<p>Coincidentally, the names of these two authors are both spelled K.E. They both describe Arnold in all aspects as a person, poet, and thinker. Chambers' book is only 144 pages long, published by the Oxford University Press, and provides many documentary dates, numbers, genealogy, and the like. Brown's book makes in-depth observations, believing that Arnold spent his entire life in the struggle between contemplation and action.</p>
<p>Chambers only makes literary explorations. He is a diligent collector of events. But this book, although full of dates and genealogies, is not a biography. It is roughly divided into chapters such as Arnold's youth, civil servant, poet, professor, philosopher, old age, and personality. Unfortunately, he underestimates the reader too much, for example, pointing out that Emerson is American, Spinoza is a 17th-century philosopher, or Yale University is located somewhere in the United States, which is unnecessary for people who want to study Arnold. Even the occasional remarks are mediocre, such as saying that his drama is better than bad love poems, and that objectivity is more important than subjectivity.</p>
<p>Brown is deeply immersed in Arnold. He can effortlessly grasp the entirety of Arnold. The scholarly detailed annotations are also worthy of praise. The writing is elegant and the theme is clear. Brown also talks about Arnold's "disinterestedness". This attitude is the best attitude in human life. Arnold is a keen absorber, like a bee collecting beeswax in distant fields. Democracy should absorb culture, and culture should also absorb democracy. In short, he tried his best to absorb the best things. He opposed localism. Because of him, the taste of British literature has expanded widely.</p>

<h3>Landlords Rampant with Cash Payments for Rice: Monthly Rent of Five Dou with Gratuitous Extra Charge of Ten Shi: The Suffering of Small People in Empty Housing Rumors</h3>
<p>Yang Yuesheng asks: My friend rented a house from A in January of the 36th year. The contract stated that my friend must first pay a tip of 600,000 yuan, and pay monthly rent of five dou of white rice, converted into market price, for a lease term of three years, with water and electricity to be paid by himself. Later, due to the difference between the official price of rice and the black market, disputes often arose. Recently, disputes have also arisen due to the cash payment for rice, and both parties insist on their own opinions and refuse to give in. Now there are several legal questions, please answer as a thank you! (1) According to the above situation, is it legal to calculate the rent according to the price of rice? What kind of rice price should be used for cash conversion? (2) The newspaper on the first of this month reported the rent case resolved by the Municipal Council, calculated at 7,000 to 9,000 times the rent in the 26th year. May I ask whether the house where my friend lives can enjoy the same rights? (3) The contract states that my friend must first pay a small fee of 600,000 yuan. Can the money, which could buy ten shi of rice at the time, be sued for improper profit and requested to be used as prepaid rent for 20 months?</p>
<p>[Lawyer Tang Mingshi answers] (1) Tips are far forbidden, and collecting rent in kind is also illegal. The rice price on the contract usually follows the rice price published by Weixin. (2) The highest price of rent decided by the Council is a measure of determining the rent. If the contract has already been made, it seems that it is not the intention to maintain order to cancel it uniformly and revise it again; I am afraid it will be inevitable to involve litigation. (3) The tip cannot be established and can be used as rent.</p>

<h3>Inspiration</h3>
<p>— Zhu Shilin</p>
<p>I have had such experiences several times: When I am trapped by a certain problem in life, I often cannot break through the encirclement no matter how hard I try. The harder I try, the more I get into a dead end, until I am exhausted and have no courage to struggle anymore. I see that I have no choice but to accept the control of fate. Occasionally, waking up in the middle of the night, in the quietness and solitude, suddenly a surge, like a flash of light, sweeps through my mind. I try to consider it, and I feel that this idea is the most ideal way to deal with the current difficulty. At that time, I was very surprised, why couldn't I think of it so foolishly during the day? Later, I finally relied on this momentary strange idea to solve my problem. I believe readers must have had similar experiences.</p>
<p>The difference in intelligence between geniuses and ordinary people is very subtle, even equal. But why are geniuses such a minority among minorities, and why do most people end up mediocre? Of course, environment and education are important factors, but the most decisive factor is that geniuses immediately grasp and utilize inspiration when it comes. Ordinary people also have inspiration, but they often dismiss it as a ridiculous fantasy. Otherwise, the civilization of today's world would definitely be more than this.</p>
<p>For example, the "explorer" Renault, although a big swindler, his whole life is spent somersaulting in adventures and speculations, but his character of seizing opportunities and making decisive decisions is indeed outstanding. Otherwise, how could a pauper climb to his current position? It is said that this time he came to China to explore, taking full advantage of the fact that exploration planes can be exempt from inspection to engage in smuggling, and once again claimed that the plane's fuel tank was leaking, resulting in another "savage head," making a fortune in this "adventurer's paradise." How could others think of such an idea! Regardless of whether his behavior is proper, it is always an expression of his inspiration. To give another example: In the biopic of Edison, Edison used thousands of substances to try making filaments for the light bulb, but none of them gave satisfactory results. Continuous work and failure exhausted him, eventually leading from disappointment to discouragement. Suddenly, he saw his assistant's face full of whiskers, and a strange idea came to him. He quickly pulled out a beard hair as his experimental material, but unfortunately it still didn't work—otherwise, inspiration would have created another miracle.</p>
<p>Inspiration comes entirely by chance and cannot be forced. It exists in the subconscious, rarely appearing, often when there are no external disturbances and the mind is calm. Sakyamuni meditated under the Bodhi tree for decades in pursuit of the true meaning of birth, old age, sickness, and death, with no results. Finally, inspiration came, and the long-sought answer was obtained once. Everyone has this possibility, the problem is how to view it. If you can grasp it and utilize it, the success you will achieve will be unbelievable even to yourself.</p>
<h3>Creation and Inspiration</h3>
<p>— Lianhu</p>
<p>When Goethe was twenty-three years old, he fell in love with a woman who was already engaged, Charlotte. Frustrated and unable to resolve it, he was planning to commit suicide when he suddenly heard the news of a friend's suicide due to unrequited love. It was as if he suddenly saw a flash of inspiration, flashing before his eyes. He immediately figured out the outline of the entire book "The Sorrows of Young Werther." He wrote it down in one breath and completed it in less than two weeks. Then he reviewed the manuscript and felt very surprised, because he had not made any effort at all. He said, "This booklet seems to have been written by a sleepwalker in a coma."</p>
<p>The musician Periot set the poem "May Fifth" by Yuan Rangjie to music. When he reached the final refrain, "Poor soldier, I will finally see France again," he suddenly stopped. After thinking over and over again, he finally couldn't think of a melody to convey the emotions of the refrain. Two years later, he was traveling in Rome and accidentally fell into the river. He was rescued and did not drown. The melody he sang when he came out of the water was the one he had searched for over and over again two years ago but could not find.</p>
<p>When the musician Wagner had completed the "Rhinegold" trilogy, he still hadn't thought of its opening tune. He was on a ship at sea, unable to sleep day or night. One afternoon, he was so tired that he finally fell into a light sleep. He seemed to feel himself sinking in a rapid current, hearing the sound of rushing water surging back and forth, forming a melody of its own. After waking up, he composed the opening tune of the trilogy based on the sound of the rapid current he heard in his dream.</p>
<p>The English poet Coleridge's "Kubla Khan" is also a work from a dream. He was originally addicted to opium. One day, after getting drunk, he sat in a chair and fell asleep. Before going to sleep, he read in a travelogue the sentence "Kubla Khan ordered the construction of a palace here, and built a magnificent garden, so a wall enclosed ten miles of fertile land." In three quarters of an hour of deep sleep, he dreamed of making two or three hundred lines of poetry based on this story. When he first woke up, he still remembered it clearly, so he took paper and pen to write it down quickly. When he wrote dozens of lines, a guest suddenly came to visit, interrupting his train of thought. After the guest left, what he saw in his dream became blurred and vague, and he could not continue writing. The fifty-three lines he wrote down are one of the three masterpieces in his complete works.</p>
<h3>A Record of Touring the Stone House and Misty Clouds Caves</h3>
<p>— Banmeng Old Man</p>
<p>There are no large caves in West Lake. Only the Zilai Cave on Jade Emperor Mountain is relatively deep and wide. Although the rest have names, they are mostly small in size. One day, I went down the mountain from Ziyun Cave, walked across the Kuahong Bridge, and visited the Quyuan Fenghe Pavilion. The outside of the pavilion used to be called Yue Lake, but there are very few lotus flowers planted, and there is no Quyuan by the lake. It can be said that the name does not match the reality. After crossing the bridge, I went south. Along the way, I passed Dongpu Wangshan Yatidi Suolan Yingbi Five Bridges, combined with Kuahong as Six Bridges. The scenery on the embankment is excellent. Except for the passing cars and rickshaws, there are very few tourists. There are stone steps on the embankment to sit on. Sitting quietly in the weeping willows and gentle breeze, all the mundane troubles are washed away, making one reluctant to leave.</p>
<p>After Su Causeway, there is the Nanling Pavilion. Sitting on the stone railing, I asked a fellow resting person about the location of the Stone House Cave. According to the answer, I had to take the car road to Chishanbu to enter the mountain. So I took the car road and passed the Siyan Jing Pavilion, turned northwest, and arrived at Daren Temple. Behind the temple is the Stone House Cave. The houses are brand new. Outside the temple gate is the Stone House Pavilion. Inside the cave, on the left is the Stone Courtyard, a small cave. On the right is a small cave, wide at the mouth and narrow at the bottom, like a conch shell, inscribed with the words "Canghai Fuluo" (Floating Conch in the Sea). The conch is similar, but the words "Canghai" (Sea) have not yet been settled. The Wengyun Cave is wonderful. Above the Stone House Cave, there is still the Qiankun Cave, which cannot become a cave. The words Qiankun (Universe) are even more absurd. The Buddha statues in the Stone House Cave are very well sculpted and worth a look.</p>
<p>After leaving Daren Temple, turning right and heading west, it is Manjuelong. There are only three or five villages here, famous for osmanthus flowers. There is Upper Manjuelong and Lower Manjuelong, but the mountain is very compact. The house on the top of Nan Gao Peak is clearly visible. Walking along the road to a short wall surrounded area, entering the door, it is the Shuile Cave. The shape of the Shuile Cave is also like a conch, the deeper the narrower. A monk hangs a sign to raise money, using a lantern to lure people into the cave, but going to the bottom of the cave, there is nothing else to see. The water in the Shuile Cave is very clear and drinkable. In the past, when I visited the Shuile Cave, I heard the sound of gurgling water on all sides, but now there is none, because it hasn't rained for a long time.</p>
<p>Yongle Cave is nothing to see. Exiting the door, climbing Gao Peak, there is a pavilion midway called Banting (Half Pavilion). After resting for a while, going up again, we arrived at Yanxia Cave. The walls of Yanxia Cave are carved with Arhat statues, a total of eighteen, plus the Great Buddha, Maitreya, Guanyin, and other statues. The Arhat statues are exquisitely carved, each with an attitude. There is a stele at the entrance of the cave, inscribed with the five characters "Yanxia Cidi Duo" (Misty Clouds Abound Here). To the right of the cave is the Su Lao Stone Altar, with strange and ancient architecture. Looking from afar on the flat ground outside the cave, the mountains are high and low, making the chest feel open and refreshed.</p>
<p>Next to the cave is Yanxia Temple, which is said to have excellent vegetarian dishes, the best of the mountain temples. When I came, the temple was already dilapidated. Entering the temple and looking around, I didn't see a single monk, but there was a young woman sitting doing housework, not even entertaining tourists, perhaps a member of the monks' family. (Editor's note: The four characters "sengzhong juanshu" (monks' family members) seem quite novel.) At that time, I didn't see anyone else visiting the cave except me, it was quiet and lonely. Outside the cave, there was only a photographer, displaying his price list advertising board, waiting for tourists. The so-called Woshi Xijiang Zhiji Zhu Ting (reclining lion sucking the river), were not seen. Below, there was an old woman setting up a cloth awning to sell tea, the tea tasted clear and delicious. From this, we can imagine the desolation after the disaster.</p>
<p>Yanxia Cave is located in a very good place, and should be the crown of all the caves in West Lake, but now Yanxia Temple has no proper monks to manage it, and the scenic spot is becoming increasingly desolate, which is regrettable. I composed a verse on the spot: "The stone is condensed and unique, the misty clouds are ancient and evoke my thoughts, for no reason, my chest is full of hills, and I pluck the old vines and pick the purple zhi." Going west from the cave, you can reach Longjing, but it was already late, so the tour of Longjing can only wait for another day.</p>

<p>Yesterday I read Old Man Banmeng's A Tour of Lingyin, saying that there is a stone cave under the Release Pond called Cangliu (藏六) Cave. I do not understand the meaning of the two characters "Cangliu". According to the Agama Sutra, "There is a turtle wrapped by a wild jackal (the name of an animal). The turtle hides the six and does not come out. The jackal is angry and abandons it. The Buddha told the bhikkhus that they should hide the six roots like a turtle, so that the demon cannot take advantage." The turtle can shrink its head, tail, and four feet, so it is called hiding the six. The meaning of Lingyin Cangliu Cave should be based on this. Su Shi's poem on the Jiaoao Pavilion has a line saying, "Gaining is like a tiger holding a target, losing is like a turtle hiding the six." Qing Yao Xibao also has a line saying, "This body has not yet become a turtle hiding the six, bustling in the human world in the same situation," both of which are used to mean escaping from the world. Today, people often scold others by saying "six shrinks," using the turtle as a metaphor. In fact, the ancients did not avoid turtles. There were many people who used the character "turtle" as a name, and there were even more who used the turtle to describe people.</p>

<p>A life without love is like a tree without flowers; even if it is immortal, it is in vain.</p>
<p>A spark, even if it is a momentary light, after all, overcomes the darkness.</p>
<p>There are three types of people in the world: those who play with love, those who do not know love, and those who are immersed in love—God knows who is the happiest!</p>
<p>Those who vent their resentment with abuse, ridicule, and curses are mediocre people, and those who deal with hatred with hatred are warriors. But it takes even greater courage to repay hatred with love.</p>
<h3>Remembering Huang Moses</h3>
<p>— Qian Dacheng</p>
<p>When Zhang Taiyan lectured at Soochow University, he was closest to Huang Moses of Changshu, and the two often talked until dawn. Moses died of illness, and his son killed someone and hid in Taiyan's place. Taiyan provided him with protection in every way, caring for the son of his old friend to the utmost. The world then knew that Moses was also no ordinary person.</p>
<p>Moses's original name was Zhensheng, and later he wanted a famous name, Muzhi, Moses was his other name. His father lived in seclusion as a merchant, but he loved the teachings of Laozi and Zhuangzi, and wrote a volume of Taoist sayings. Moses's articles were thousands of words long, and his extraordinary spirit overflowed from the paper. He did not care about trivial matters. During the day, he rode horses as a playboy, and read books at night. Sometimes he would not sleep for a month, or he would write dozens of poems in one night. When he was a professor at Soochow University, he compiled a history of Chinese literature in twenty-nine volumes, the size of which was unmatched in the world, and it was stored in the university library. It is not known whether it was scattered during the chaos. He was especially good at writing lyrics, and he harmonized with all the works of Gong Dingzhen, Zhang Gaowen, and Jiang Jianren. Yan Gu Old Man wrote a preface and published it, saying: "Its mystery is like a child, its resentment is like the Sorrow, its emptiness is like Zen, its etherealness is like a ghost, its seductiveness is like a simple woman, speaking unspeakable words, expressing unattainable meanings, entrusting unentrustable emotions, like a spiderweb floating in the long sky, not knowing where it dwells, but also dwelling everywhere." He also said: "Huang Zi Moses is learned but stingy. His lyrics, why do they make me so sad, so thoughtful, as if I see the quiet Huang Zi with his short hair fluttering on his back, reciting in a low voice in the dim lamp and curved screen. ..." Moses relied on the tune Phoenix Perching on Wutong to write his own anthology of lyrics, saying: "An inch of heart is the home of ten thousand ages of emotional demons, accumulated tears are like a river, accumulated hatred is like mountains piled up; may the beautiful women be transformed into the moon, and the mountains and rivers leave shadows without birth or death. The moon falls to the west, and it is always a waste to search for it. Hou Yi is always poor, and he is ashamed to receive Chunhu's memories; flying up to the blue sky without strength, the colorful food is thrown straight into the rainbow." In his later years, he searched for more than two hundred lyricists from the Song and Yuan Dynasties who were good at writing lyrics but not famous, wanting to carve them to pass them down to the world, but he became ill and crazy for several months, tearing up almost all of his treasured books. Wu Jiang Jin Songcen called Moses's legends and Yisheng comparable to Wu Mei; the two were also good friends. Moses could not delve into the intricacies of the rules, but his abundant and leisurely state often surpassed Wu Mei. After Mei passed away, he was hailed as a master of lyric and musical learning, but Moses's name and reputation were both gone, and few people in the world knew about him. Mr. Jin Shuyuan worked with Moses for three years and often advised him to write, but Moses sighed and said: "I am at the end of my rope, unable to do anything!" In his heart, he had unspeakable pain, and he did not want to indulge in the sea of trivial writing in order to seek a small name after his death. Jin Songcen listed Moses in the biographies of the Five Eccentrics of Suzhou, saying that Moses was talented but suspicious. Some say that his person is strange, his writing is strange, and his death is also strange, nothing is not strange, so his encounters are also strange.</p>
<p>###</p>
<p>The summer vacation is over, and there are many graduates from various universities. How to continue "studies" and have a "career" has become a very serious problem. The misery of "graduation is unemployment" has been called for for many years, not starting from today, but now it is even more difficult because the destruction of transportation is becoming more and more blocked, and the destruction or abandonment of construction has occurred in various places. The situation in important areas has changed. For example, it was often heard that people went to the Northeast to work in the past two summers, but this year, only people from the Northeast are seen moving to the interior, one after another. From this, we can imagine the situation in various places, and after slightly examining the phenomenon that destruction is greater than construction, we know that after leaving school, we cannot help but feel the vastness of the road ahead.</p>
<p>University students should, in principle, aim at academics. The so-called "learning for the sake of learning" is the true essence of the highest institution, which is different from the creation of practical talents in vocational schools, especially those who "study for the sake of career" in vocational schools. This principle has been greatly clarified to the world since the "May Fourth Movement" and the development of the new culture, and after the reform of the school system. Therefore, graduating from university and being eager to find a job seems inconsistent with the university's standpoint. But the fact is that livelihood is pressing, and we still cannot fully comply with the original intention. The old saying "only when clothing and food are sufficient do people know honor and disgrace" still has a taste. Even if one is determined to research and has the ability to invent, it is impossible to serve the public on an empty stomach. Even if the national strength can support university graduate students, it is difficult to cover the majority of graduates from various schools. Therefore, the close connection between career and study is inevitable and reasonable. Over the years, before each graduation, regardless of whether it is a university or a vocational school, the registration office in the school will prepare a roster, and the document office will prepare a draft of recommendations, inquiring with relevant professional or technical application agencies for recommendations, so that they can have a place to settle down as soon as they leave school. On average, industry needs materials most urgently, and it is easier to place those who study engineering. As long as the situation is stable and order is normal in other departments, there will not be a complete lack of placement, only the difference between more or less, sooner or later, but now it is difficult to say.</p>
